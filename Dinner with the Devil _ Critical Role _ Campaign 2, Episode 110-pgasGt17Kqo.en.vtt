00:00:00.078 --> 00:00:01.897
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode

00:00:01.897 --> 00:00:04.000
of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.029
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.751
ALL: (hollering) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:08.751 --> 00:00:11.029
MATT: It's a lot of syllables in that one.

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:12.145
But before we get into that, we do have

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:13.247
some quick announcements to get through,

00:00:13.247 --> 00:00:16.472
beginning with the first of our two sponsors.

00:00:16.472 --> 00:00:19.501
The first is the wonderful NordVPN.

00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:23.392
So let's turn over to our resident hackers, Sam and Laura.

00:00:23.392 --> 00:00:25.514
SAM: Okay. Okay, KryptonicOverride.

00:00:25.514 --> 00:00:27.688
Now that Taliesin freed us from the internet,

00:00:27.688 --> 00:00:29.586
and with NordVPN encrypting our traffic

00:00:29.586 --> 00:00:31.728
and hiding our IP and physical location,

00:00:31.728 --> 00:00:35.767
we can unlock the secret of the evil Ultra Codex.

00:00:35.767 --> 00:00:38.659
LAURA: This'll be a walk in the park, blackwillow69.

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:42.369
Time to ja-- ja...

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:43.619
TALIESIN: Jack in?

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:47.858
LAURA: Jack in, yes, to the main-- main something.

00:00:47.858 --> 00:00:49.450
TALIESIN: Frame.
LAURA: Frame!

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.928
LAURA: Positronic. Obviously.

00:00:51.928 --> 00:00:54.112
Time to jack into the mainframe.
SAM: Yeah, let's do it!

00:00:54.112 --> 00:00:55.695
Okay, here we go.

00:00:56.843 --> 00:00:58.038
Oh, a firewall.

00:00:58.038 --> 00:00:59.872
Oh, dang. I--

00:00:59.872 --> 00:01:01.591
I have no idea what to do.

00:01:01.591 --> 00:01:03.412
I'm stuck.

00:01:03.412 --> 00:01:07.163
LAURA: Oh, BlackWillow, I got a cube over here?

00:01:07.163 --> 00:01:08.986
Guess I'm going to have to beam it?

00:01:08.986 --> 00:01:11.552
I don't know, do you beam a cube? I don't--

00:01:11.552 --> 00:01:15.217
SAM: No, no, I think you dream it, or meme it?

00:01:15.217 --> 00:01:16.417
I can't remember.

00:01:16.417 --> 00:01:18.694
LAURA: Oh no, no, no, it's asking for a password!

00:01:18.694 --> 00:01:20.300
SAM: Password? No problem.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.393
Wait, actually, we should probably respect their privacy

00:01:22.393 --> 00:01:24.249
and just stop right there.
TRAVIS: Whoa.

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:26.542
TALIESIN: Oh my GameCube.

00:01:26.542 --> 00:01:28.063
You've lost your powers!

00:01:28.063 --> 00:01:30.335
SAM: Wait, what?

00:01:30.335 --> 00:01:32.345
TALIESIN: When you were in the web, the Serial Killer

00:01:32.345 --> 00:01:35.119
must have drained your haxxor abilities!

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.120
Your minds have been sliced!

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.782
SAM: But we're the most sophisticated key punchers

00:01:39.782 --> 00:01:41.751
the dark net has ever booted!

00:01:41.751 --> 00:01:44.811
There isn't a digital Kenan that we can't Kel!

00:01:44.811 --> 00:01:45.991
TALIESIN: There's no doubt that--

00:01:45.991 --> 00:01:48.357
ASHLEY: Wow.
(laughter)

00:01:48.357 --> 00:01:50.047
TALIESIN: You are the greatest crypto kings

00:01:50.047 --> 00:01:51.798
to ever keylog a target.

00:01:51.798 --> 00:01:53.060
But without your hacking skills,

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.681
you'll never beat the Ultra Codex.

00:01:55.681 --> 00:01:58.163
LAURA: What do we do, FreezerBurn?

00:01:58.163 --> 00:02:01.049
TALIESIN: There is a way, but it's dangerous.

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.888
I could download my entire 1.21 gigaflops

00:02:03.888 --> 00:02:06.903
of brain archives into your Flashdance protocol.

00:02:06.903 --> 00:02:08.864
SAM: Wait a second, a data transfer?

00:02:08.864 --> 00:02:10.959
But you'd be giving up your master level

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.343
computer powers, forever!

00:02:14.343 --> 00:02:16.015
TALIESIN: It's the only way.

00:02:16.015 --> 00:02:19.178
One last hack, for justice!

00:02:19.178 --> 00:02:22.849
SAM, LAURA, and TALIESIN: Haxxors, click together.

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:23.729
SAM: Okay.

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:27.412
(laughter)

00:02:27.412 --> 00:02:30.336
(laughter)

00:02:30.336 --> 00:02:31.881
MATT: Oh no!

00:02:31.881 --> 00:02:34.341
TALIESIN: We're only going to have one shot.

00:02:34.341 --> 00:02:35.174
SAM: You okay over there?

00:02:35.174 --> 00:02:36.065
TALIESIN: I'll be fine.

00:02:36.065 --> 00:02:39.259
(laughter)

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:41.220
TALIESIN: Power glove is overcranked.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.198
Transfer modules, hot and bothered. Master and commander?

00:02:45.198 --> 00:02:46.963
SAM: The far side of the world.

00:02:46.963 --> 00:02:49.036
LAURA: Far side of the world!

00:02:49.036 --> 00:02:51.058
TALIESIN: Farewell, hacker planet.

00:02:51.058 --> 00:02:52.958
It was leet while it lasted.

00:02:52.958 --> 00:02:55.925
Activating self-slice!

00:02:55.925 --> 00:03:00.825
SAM, LAURA, and TALIESIN: (screaming)

00:03:04.164 --> 00:03:05.641
LAURA: Did it work?

00:03:05.641 --> 00:03:08.323
SAM: Zero one zero one one zero zero one.

00:03:08.323 --> 00:03:09.156
LAURA: (gasps)

00:03:09.156 --> 00:03:11.050
That's binary for yes.
SAM: Yeah!

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.718
LAURA: I know binary!
SAM: Yeah!

00:03:12.718 --> 00:03:15.168
LAURA: FreezerBurn, are you okay?

00:03:15.168 --> 00:03:17.911
TALIESIN: Oh. Oh, who?

00:03:17.911 --> 00:03:19.011
Oh jeez.

00:03:19.011 --> 00:03:22.211
Those are some pretty doohickeys you got there.

00:03:22.211 --> 00:03:24.824
Are those calculators on your arm or something?

00:03:24.824 --> 00:03:26.485
LAURA: Holy shift.

00:03:26.485 --> 00:03:27.451
He's gone.

00:03:28.486 --> 00:03:30.936
FreezerBurn's sacrifice will not be in vain.

00:03:30.936 --> 00:03:31.769
SAM: No.

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.765
LAURA: Because we're going to heck--
SAM and LAURA: -- the Ultra Codex.

00:03:34.765 --> 00:03:38.385
SAM: Yeah, and with NordVPN's 68% off sale going on,

00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:40.735
it'll only cost us $3.71 a month,

00:03:40.735 --> 00:03:42.750
plus we get an additional month free

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.690
when we sign up at nordvpn.com/criticalrole

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.713
and use coupon code criticalrole.

00:03:47.713 --> 00:03:49.969
NordVPN's secure and unlimited service

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:52.126
will literally save the world.

00:03:52.126 --> 00:03:52.959
LAURA: Yeah.

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.080
SAM and LAURA: Matt, hack to you.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.049
MATT: (sighs)

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:03.049
(laughter)

00:04:03.642 --> 00:04:07.505
MATT: Tune in next time for another techno-tastic episode

00:04:07.505 --> 00:04:10.302
of the Nord in the Stone.

00:04:10.302 --> 00:04:11.382
TRAVIS: Wow.

00:04:11.382 --> 00:04:14.227
MATT: If NordVPN never sponsors us again.

00:04:14.227 --> 00:04:15.765
LIAM: That was a dramatic reading.

00:04:15.765 --> 00:04:16.725
MATT: (laughs)

00:04:16.725 --> 00:04:17.738
ASHLEY: That was very dramatic.

00:04:17.738 --> 00:04:20.058
MATT: Wow, yeah, that took some turns.

00:04:20.058 --> 00:04:21.525
ASHLEY: The prop work was great.

00:04:21.525 --> 00:04:22.427
SAM: Thank you.

00:04:22.427 --> 00:04:23.589
MATT: Well done.

00:04:23.589 --> 00:04:24.766
SAM: Thank you, Maxwell.

00:04:24.766 --> 00:04:27.144
MATT: Thank you, Sam and Laura and Taliesin,

00:04:27.144 --> 00:04:29.679
and Nord VPN for your patience.

00:04:29.679 --> 00:04:30.554
And our--

00:04:30.554 --> 00:04:32.034
MARISHA: Did you shake it to turn it off?

00:04:32.034 --> 00:04:33.750
That was incredible!

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.090
MATT: (laughs)

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.048
MARISHA: Oh my god.

00:04:36.048 --> 00:04:38.274
MATT: That's how I turn off all my electronics.

00:04:38.274 --> 00:04:40.210
That's how I turn off my PS4.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.300
LAURA: Might leave my haxxor
gear on the table for the game,

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.935
because it's awesome.
MATT: It's pretty cool.

00:04:43.935 --> 00:04:45.006
TALIESIN: That looks like a lot of fun.

00:04:45.006 --> 00:04:46.526
SAM: That won't distract us at all.

00:04:46.526 --> 00:04:49.113
(laughter)

00:04:49.113 --> 00:04:50.762
MATT: All righty, and our second sponsor for tonight,

00:04:50.762 --> 00:04:53.317

00:04:53.317 --> 00:04:55.368

And that's it for our sponsors for tonight.

00:05:36.655 --> 00:05:38.028
As far as announcements go, Marisha,

00:05:38.028 --> 00:05:39.380
you got something to talk about.

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.254
MARISHA: Yeah, in case you missed it,

00:05:42.254 --> 00:05:45.752
first episode back of Talks Machina.

00:05:45.752 --> 00:05:47.414
(laughter)

00:05:47.414 --> 00:05:48.564
MARISHA: Yeah!

00:05:48.564 --> 00:05:50.014
SAM: Did it air already?
MARISHA: It's back!

00:05:50.014 --> 00:05:52.718
It did, it aired and it is now on YouTube.

00:05:52.718 --> 00:05:54.044
ASHLEY: It was so good!

00:05:54.044 --> 00:05:54.877
MARISHA: It was great!

00:05:54.877 --> 00:05:56.908
SAM: Brian was so great!

00:05:56.908 --> 00:05:58.399
MARISHA: Yeah, featuring Laura and Matt.

00:05:58.399 --> 00:05:59.411
MATT: We had a good talk.
LAURA: Yeah.

00:05:59.411 --> 00:06:00.760
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: Yeah.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.500
MARISHA: Amazing. And since it now airs every other week,

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:08.137
next episode will air on Twitch next Tuesday,

00:06:08.137 --> 00:06:12.078
September 29th, 7:00pm, of course.

00:06:12.078 --> 00:06:13.960
Yeah, of course.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.475
And as always, the VOD will be available on YouTube

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:21.692
But it's back!

00:06:21.692 --> 00:06:22.685
MATT: Look at that shit.
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:06:22.685 --> 00:06:23.601
SAM: Awesome.
MATT: Thank you.

00:06:23.601 --> 00:06:25.341
MARISHA: Talking about the D&amp;Ds.

00:06:25.341 --> 00:06:26.831
LIAM: Woo.
MATT: Hell yeah.

00:06:26.831 --> 00:06:28.453
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.
TRAVIS: Nice.

00:06:28.453 --> 00:06:29.522
MATT: All right, thank you, Marisha.

00:06:29.522 --> 00:06:30.426
MARISHA: Double plug.

00:06:30.426 --> 00:06:31.440
MATT: And Laura, you got an announcement

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.465
you want to make real fast.
LAURA: Yes!

00:06:32.465 --> 00:06:34.992
It's a little one, but it's a good one.

00:06:34.992 --> 00:06:37.665
All of our Mighty Nein chibi pins

00:06:37.665 --> 00:06:40.034

00:06:40.034 --> 00:06:44.167
are now available in our Australia store.

00:06:44.167 --> 00:06:45.883
ALL: Hey!

00:06:45.883 --> 00:06:46.858
LAURA: Ta-da!

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:54.732
MATT: Fantastic.
LAURA: That's it, that's all I got.

00:06:54.732 --> 00:06:57.176
MATT: Awesome. Thank you, Laura.

00:06:57.176 --> 00:06:58.009
All righty.

00:06:58.009 --> 00:07:00.040
I believe with the end of our announcements,

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.590
that brings us into tonight's episode of

00:07:04.624 --> 00:07:05.840
Critical Role.

00:07:07.835 --> 00:07:10.140
(water bubbling)

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:11.981
(thunder rumbling)

00:07:14.968 --> 00:07:17.393
(explosion booming)

00:07:17.393 --> 00:07:18.351
â™ª Role â™ª

00:07:18.351 --> 00:07:20.275
â™ª Critical Role â™ª

00:07:20.275 --> 00:07:22.387
â™ª Critical Role â™ª

00:07:22.387 --> 00:07:24.436
â™ª Critical Role â™ª

00:07:24.436 --> 00:07:26.313
â™ª Critical Role â™ª

00:07:26.313 --> 00:07:29.206
â™ª Critical Role â™ª
â™ª Mighty Nein, Mighty Nein â™ª

00:07:29.206 --> 00:07:33.747
â™ª Roll the dice, roll the dice â™ª

00:07:33.747 --> 00:07:35.836
â™ª The adventure begins â™ª

00:07:35.836 --> 00:07:37.896
â™ª They were always beside you â™ª

00:07:37.896 --> 00:07:39.976
â™ª Your nerdy best friends â™ª

00:07:39.976 --> 00:07:42.076
â™ª And the DM to guide you â™ª

00:07:42.076 --> 00:07:46.501
â™ª And they rise from the flames for the battles ahead â™ª

00:07:46.501 --> 00:07:51.501
â™ª Villains beware 'cause you're 'bout to be dead â™ª

00:07:54.861 --> 00:07:56.939
â™ª They got magic and flair â™ª

00:07:56.939 --> 00:07:59.117
â™ª They got falchions and cunning â™ª

00:07:59.117 --> 00:08:01.131
â™ª They don't see over there â™ª

00:08:01.131 --> 00:08:03.122
â™ª There's a monster incoming â™ª

00:08:03.122 --> 00:08:07.596
â™ª Inspiration is waiting, rise up, don't think twice â™ª

00:08:07.596 --> 00:08:09.196
â™ª Put your fate in your hands, â™ª

00:08:09.196 --> 00:08:12.058
â™ª take a chance, roll the dice â™ª

00:08:12.058 --> 00:08:13.245
â™ª Role â™ª

00:08:13.245 --> 00:08:15.061
â™ª Critical Role (roll the dice) â™ª

00:08:15.061 --> 00:08:17.053
â™ª Critical Role (roll the dice) â™ª

00:08:17.053 --> 00:08:20.104
â™ª Critical Role (roll the dice) â™ª

00:08:20.104 --> 00:08:22.152
â™ª Can you answer the call â™ª

00:08:22.152 --> 00:08:24.292
â™ª Diggin' deep in your soul â™ª

00:08:24.292 --> 00:08:26.402
â™ª As the legend unfolds â™ª

00:08:26.402 --> 00:08:27.733
â™ª Now it's your turn â™ª

00:08:27.733 --> 00:08:30.243
â™ª Your turn, your turn â™ª

00:08:30.243 --> 00:08:34.893
â™ª To roll â™ª

00:08:35.731 --> 00:08:40.673
(flames whooshing)

00:08:43.914 --> 00:08:45.442
MATT: And welcome back.

00:08:45.442 --> 00:08:49.204
So last we left off: The Mighty Nein,

00:08:49.204 --> 00:08:51.691
after returning from Traveler Con

00:08:51.691 --> 00:08:52.821
and their adventures at Rumblecusp,

00:08:52.821 --> 00:08:56.053
made their way to Nicodranas to catch up a bit

00:08:56.053 --> 00:08:58.703
with Marion Lavorre.
LAURA: Yeah!

00:08:58.703 --> 00:09:01.862
MATT: To do some shopping, to set off some research

00:09:01.862 --> 00:09:03.675
into some aspects of the mysteries

00:09:03.675 --> 00:09:06.872
that surround some of their recent adventures,

00:09:06.872 --> 00:09:09.386
and we--

00:09:09.386 --> 00:09:11.302
I guess introduced-- not introduced--

00:09:11.302 --> 00:09:13.576
returned Nott to spend some time

00:09:13.576 --> 00:09:16.968
with her family. Veth, with her family.

00:09:18.489 --> 00:09:20.156
During that period of time, you all decided

00:09:20.156 --> 00:09:21.629
to make your way to Rexxentrum,

00:09:21.629 --> 00:09:25.873
to speak with Lady Vess DeRogna,

00:09:25.873 --> 00:09:28.233
one of the members of the Cerberus Assembly,

00:09:28.233 --> 00:09:31.151
who had previously said that they were interested

00:09:31.151 --> 00:09:35.165
in some transactions, or a business opportunity for you,

00:09:35.165 --> 00:09:38.102
after seeing what you had achieved

00:09:38.102 --> 00:09:40.964
in the name of the negotiation that ended

00:09:40.964 --> 00:09:45.797
the current war between Xhorhas and the Dwendalian Empire.

00:09:46.995 --> 00:09:49.786
After doing a little shopping around Rexxentrum

00:09:49.786 --> 00:09:54.344
and gathering some extremely powerful magical artifacts,

00:09:54.344 --> 00:09:58.833
you made your way to the DeRogna's tower,

00:09:58.833 --> 00:10:03.480
had a conversation that outlined the future interest she had

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:07.422
to the north, in a location known as Eiselcross.

00:10:08.322 --> 00:10:12.412
She let you know about an element of a shadow war

00:10:12.412 --> 00:10:14.526
that had been long brewing in that direction

00:10:14.526 --> 00:10:18.352
and a race to power between many factions,

00:10:18.352 --> 00:10:22.774
namely the Empire and the Dynasty, in search of these ruins

00:10:22.774 --> 00:10:26.226
that had begun to uncovered in recent times

00:10:26.226 --> 00:10:27.559
beneath the ice.

00:10:28.507 --> 00:10:30.407
Broken bits of the

00:10:30.407 --> 00:10:35.290
ancient arcane city of Aeor seem to have been

00:10:36.373 --> 00:10:39.494
slowly recovered from beneath that region,

00:10:39.494 --> 00:10:42.212
and she would wish you to accompany her there

00:10:42.212 --> 00:10:44.865
in search of more information and answers

00:10:44.865 --> 00:10:47.920
as to what it's capable of, what can be found,

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.942
and preventing others that she feels

00:10:50.942 --> 00:10:53.988
should not have such power within their midst.

00:10:53.988 --> 00:10:57.786
So you accepted this and were given about a week or so

00:10:57.786 --> 00:10:59.742
to return when you finished your preparations

00:10:59.742 --> 00:11:03.109
to begin your journey to this odd,

00:11:03.109 --> 00:11:06.763
much colder region of Wildemount.

00:11:06.763 --> 00:11:10.274
Upon exiting the tower in Rexxentrum,

00:11:10.274 --> 00:11:12.813
not too terribly long after your arrival,

00:11:12.813 --> 00:11:14.760
a message was delivered to the group,

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:17.415
a letter that was addressed to Bren.

00:11:17.415 --> 00:11:20.157
Upon reading the letter, it seems that your presence

00:11:20.157 --> 00:11:24.032
was also noted by Master Trent Ikithon,

00:11:25.152 --> 00:11:28.716
who then requested the presence of you, Caleb,

00:11:28.716 --> 00:11:33.296
and your companions, the evening of the next day,

00:11:33.296 --> 00:11:36.185
to join in his tower, along with

00:11:36.185 --> 00:11:40.385
your two previous classmates, Astrid and Eadwulf.

00:11:41.735 --> 00:11:43.327
And that was where we had left off.

00:11:43.327 --> 00:11:46.652
So as you all stand around Caleb

00:11:46.652 --> 00:11:49.460
in the midday, cloudy air,

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:52.119
on the not terribly bustling streets

00:11:52.119 --> 00:11:55.327
of the Candles region of Rexxentrum,

00:11:56.314 --> 00:11:58.101
as Caleb finishes reading this letter out loud

00:11:58.101 --> 00:11:59.125
to the rest of you,

00:12:01.359 --> 00:12:02.434
what do you do?

00:12:06.662 --> 00:12:07.820
LAURA: Are you going to go?

00:12:13.393 --> 00:12:14.918
LIAM: (sighs)

00:12:15.993 --> 00:12:16.959
<i>Ja</i>.

00:12:20.232 --> 00:12:22.982
<i>Ja</i>, it's what we came back for.

00:12:25.843 --> 00:12:30.776
There's a lot I don't understand still.

00:12:33.509 --> 00:12:34.342
And...

00:12:38.058 --> 00:12:39.475
my old teacher...

00:12:42.212 --> 00:12:43.045
is...

00:12:47.851 --> 00:12:48.768
LAURA: A douche?

00:12:51.256 --> 00:12:55.089
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, but I don't know how

00:12:57.192 --> 00:13:01.326
redeemable or not my friends are.

00:13:03.684 --> 00:13:06.625
I don't have a lot of faith that they are, but...

00:13:11.361 --> 00:13:12.953
I need to know.

00:13:14.975 --> 00:13:15.925
For sure.

00:13:18.752 --> 00:13:21.560
And then also, I have many questions about the Assembly.

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:24.585
It is hard to know if they have--

00:13:26.569 --> 00:13:28.720
if their plans line up with the king's

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.595
or if they have their own plans.

00:13:31.595 --> 00:13:34.606
If they have the same plan within the Assembly.

00:13:34.606 --> 00:13:36.814
They don't all seem to get along.

00:13:39.243 --> 00:13:41.429
LAURA: You don't think it's a trap, do you?

00:13:41.429 --> 00:13:44.679
LIAM: I think it very well could be a trap.

00:13:45.713 --> 00:13:48.388
TRAVIS: What do you think he wants from this meeting,

00:13:48.388 --> 00:13:49.304
from you?

00:13:58.096 --> 00:13:59.874
LIAM: That's a very good question and I'm not sure

00:13:59.874 --> 00:14:02.791
I can give you a definitive answer.

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:04.723
But...

00:14:06.959 --> 00:14:09.492
Trent took his work very personally.

00:14:10.724 --> 00:14:12.874
My best guess is

00:14:14.948 --> 00:14:18.051
I am somewhat of a failed experiment.

00:14:18.051 --> 00:14:18.884
TRAVIS: Hmm.

00:14:23.682 --> 00:14:24.515
LIAM: I don't know.

00:14:24.515 --> 00:14:27.579
I don't know why I was left abandoned for so long.

00:14:31.727 --> 00:14:32.860
I'm curious.

00:14:35.476 --> 00:14:38.668
MARISHA: What if you aren't a failed experiment?

00:14:42.516 --> 00:14:44.749
LIAM: You think there's another shoe going to drop?

00:14:44.749 --> 00:14:46.243
MARISHA: Maybe.

00:14:46.243 --> 00:14:48.002
LAURA: Like they let him go on purpose?

00:14:51.511 --> 00:14:53.294
TRAVIS: We've certainly achieved more than

00:14:55.002 --> 00:14:56.030
he had previously.

00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:58.497
Perhaps he's just in favor now?

00:15:00.204 --> 00:15:01.654
LIAM: I've considered it.

00:15:03.746 --> 00:15:05.968
MARISHA: Just trying to think of all the angles.

00:15:07.743 --> 00:15:09.576
LIAM: Regardless, Beauregard--

00:15:09.576 --> 00:15:12.409
LAURA: I think it's "irregardless."

00:15:12.409 --> 00:15:13.720
TRAVIS: Irregardless?

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:14.797
TALIESIN: Unregardless.

00:15:14.797 --> 00:15:16.499
LAURA: Unregardless, that was it.

00:15:16.499 --> 00:15:17.973
LIAM: Zemnian is very precise.

00:15:17.973 --> 00:15:20.585
MARISHA: They did just update that in the Cobalt Reserve

00:15:20.585 --> 00:15:22.301
dictionary.
LAURA: No, no!

00:15:22.301 --> 00:15:24.186
TRAVIS: They did fucking update it, actually.

00:15:24.186 --> 00:15:25.215
LAURA: No.

00:15:25.215 --> 00:15:26.576
TRAVIS: Just maddening.
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

00:15:26.576 --> 00:15:28.232
LIAM: It's decay of the Empire.

00:15:28.232 --> 00:15:30.482
TRAVIS: Death by a thousand cuts.

00:15:34.233 --> 00:15:35.719
LIAM: It could be a trap, though.

00:15:35.719 --> 00:15:39.110
And I need to impress upon you.

00:15:40.413 --> 00:15:44.468
Ikithon is about as dangerous an individual

00:15:44.468 --> 00:15:46.949
as you will encounter in your lives,

00:15:46.949 --> 00:15:49.032
and Eadwulf and Astrid...

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:57.662
are likely not too far behind,

00:15:57.662 --> 00:15:59.112
or maybe they--

00:15:59.112 --> 00:16:01.536
LAURA: They can't be as powerful as you are.

00:16:04.227 --> 00:16:06.448
LIAM: They have a bit of a head start on me, Jester.

00:16:06.448 --> 00:16:07.281
LAURA: How?

00:16:08.792 --> 00:16:09.936
Were they there longer?
MARISHA: They didn't drop out.

00:16:09.936 --> 00:16:10.769
LAURA: What?

00:16:10.769 --> 00:16:12.015
MARISHA: They didn't drop out.

00:16:12.015 --> 00:16:13.673
LAURA: Yeah, but

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:18.519
you use so many spells, you're so powerful,

00:16:18.519 --> 00:16:20.619
and you've been learning from lots of different sources.

00:16:20.619 --> 00:16:22.969
They only had the one source.

00:16:24.707 --> 00:16:27.957
LIAM: Well, they didn't take a nap for a decade.

00:16:30.953 --> 00:16:31.786
But--

00:16:34.491 --> 00:16:36.416
Just be ready for anything.

00:16:37.749 --> 00:16:41.595
He is powerful, Ikithon, but they--

00:16:41.595 --> 00:16:44.281
I can only guess at some of the things they have done

00:16:44.281 --> 00:16:47.820
since I knew them, but there is much that I do know.

00:16:48.728 --> 00:16:52.240
And they made the ultimate sacrifice for country.

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.649
LAURA: How old were you when you were here?

00:16:58.147 --> 00:17:00.210
LIAM: I was a young man; I was 16.

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:01.593
LAURA: 16?
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

00:17:06.536 --> 00:17:09.719
ASHLEY: Wait, you slept for 10 years?

00:17:09.719 --> 00:17:12.025
Or is this just like a figure of speech?

00:17:12.991 --> 00:17:14.734
MARISHA: Rip van Widogast.

00:17:17.215 --> 00:17:21.015
LIAM: I was not in my right mind

00:17:21.015 --> 00:17:23.240
for a long time.

00:17:24.318 --> 00:17:25.718
ASHLEY: I understand.

00:17:27.259 --> 00:17:29.067
LAURA: So you weren't actually sleeping.

00:17:31.957 --> 00:17:33.228
Were you sleeping?

00:17:33.228 --> 00:17:34.493
LIAM: No.

00:17:34.493 --> 00:17:35.796
Technically no.

00:17:35.796 --> 00:17:37.562
LAURA: Okay, because I-- okay.

00:17:38.717 --> 00:17:40.900
ASHLEY: Was someone else

00:17:42.808 --> 00:17:44.941
controlling you?

00:17:44.941 --> 00:17:46.801
LIAM: At that time?
ASHLEY: At that time?

00:17:46.801 --> 00:17:48.718
LIAM: No, not at that time.

00:17:52.203 --> 00:17:56.445
There are some gaps for some of you.

00:17:58.999 --> 00:18:01.040
Could we go somewhere

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.365
a little more private than the street?

00:18:04.448 --> 00:18:07.048
LAURA: Yeah. Let's go.
TRAVIS: Yes, of course.

00:18:09.456 --> 00:18:10.507
LIAM: Okay.

00:18:10.507 --> 00:18:13.090
I would like to try to navigate our way

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:15.565
to some sort of an inn.

00:18:16.683 --> 00:18:18.123
MATT: Okay, yeah.

00:18:18.123 --> 00:18:20.739
LAURA: (laughs) You're still not here!

00:18:20.739 --> 00:18:23.365
(laughs) Okay, okay, okay.

00:18:23.365 --> 00:18:25.285
It's still the same day, right?

00:18:25.285 --> 00:18:27.446
It's still the same day that we left Veth?

00:18:27.446 --> 00:18:28.537
MATT: Since the morning, yes.

00:18:28.537 --> 00:18:30.725
LAURA: Okay, so we're calling you tomorrow.

00:18:30.725 --> 00:18:32.125
SAM: Take your time.
LAURA: Okay.

00:18:32.125 --> 00:18:35.211
TRAVIS: Nice place. Just keep chilling.
SAM: I'm doing fine.

00:18:35.211 --> 00:18:37.755
ASHLEY: Wait, no, aren't you coming here this morning?

00:18:37.755 --> 00:18:39.571
MATT: Hmm.

00:18:39.571 --> 00:18:42.153
Are you looking for an inn here in the Shimmer Ward,

00:18:42.153 --> 00:18:43.843
or are you looking for something a little more--?

00:18:43.843 --> 00:18:45.621
LIAM: Something very rudimentary.

00:18:45.621 --> 00:18:47.242
MATT: Okay. Yeah, easy enough.

00:18:47.242 --> 00:18:48.317
Back to the...

00:18:49.952 --> 00:18:51.677
Not too far from where you

00:18:51.677 --> 00:18:55.585
first arrived at the Rexxentrum Archive

00:18:55.585 --> 00:18:57.245
of the Cobalt Soul,

00:18:57.245 --> 00:19:00.853
you find a small corner

00:19:00.853 --> 00:19:04.827
of two dingy roads inn that maybe can house--

00:19:05.858 --> 00:19:07.993
has about six rooms for rent.

00:19:07.993 --> 00:19:11.561
It can house a handful of people per chamber.

00:19:11.561 --> 00:19:12.518
LIAM: Okay.

00:19:12.518 --> 00:19:16.594
MATT: But it's really inexpensive, I'd say for--

00:19:16.594 --> 00:19:17.752
It's about a....

00:19:19.234 --> 00:19:21.984
two silver pieces to rent a room.

00:19:23.469 --> 00:19:28.000
LIAM: I will rent it just to be perfunctory and find--

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.771
and there eating down below?

00:19:30.613 --> 00:19:34.364
MATT: This isn't so much a lunch tavern, more than just--

00:19:34.364 --> 00:19:36.330
LIAM: A place to stay.
MATT: -- a place to stay.

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:37.738
They do have snacks.

00:19:37.738 --> 00:19:38.917
LIAM: Nah. It will do.

00:19:38.917 --> 00:19:40.810
I will lead everyone up to the room.

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:42.014
MATT: Okay.

00:19:42.014 --> 00:19:43.398
LIAM: That I've rented.

00:19:43.398 --> 00:19:45.743
LAURA: This place is nice, Caleb.

00:19:45.743 --> 00:19:47.867
LIAM: We're only going to stay for a moment.

00:19:47.867 --> 00:19:49.534
I'm not comfortable--

00:19:52.723 --> 00:19:54.240
There are gaps.

00:20:00.575 --> 00:20:04.240
Astrid and Eadwulf were willing to do

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.381
anything that...

00:20:07.507 --> 00:20:09.065
Ikithon asked of them.

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:14.138
And their final test was to kill their own flesh and blood.

00:20:15.005 --> 00:20:16.338
And they did so.

00:20:21.197 --> 00:20:23.122
And I am like them.

00:20:25.863 --> 00:20:26.696
W--was...

00:20:31.007 --> 00:20:32.673
Am. Am like them.

00:20:34.708 --> 00:20:36.205
MARISHA: Was.

00:20:36.205 --> 00:20:38.079
TALIESIN: We share a road with a lot of people.

00:20:38.079 --> 00:20:41.417
That doesn't mean that they're all the same,

00:20:41.417 --> 00:20:44.584
especially when you take a crossroads.

00:20:45.885 --> 00:20:48.143
LAURA: So you-- you did it?

00:20:54.963 --> 00:20:57.063
LIAM: I-I-I have considered...

00:21:00.902 --> 00:21:04.568
sharing all this for a long time, but...

00:21:06.572 --> 00:21:10.364
you cherish your family so much.

00:21:13.105 --> 00:21:13.938
And...

00:21:17.898 --> 00:21:20.156
I suppose I enjoyed

00:21:21.723 --> 00:21:25.748
being seen as I should have been.

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:28.733
Or-- or could have been.

00:21:31.427 --> 00:21:33.893
LAURA: I just go up and give him a hug.

00:21:39.883 --> 00:21:42.170
LIAM: There is a reason I have never told you

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:44.420
about my mother and father.

00:21:45.541 --> 00:21:48.341
LAURA: You must've been so sad, Caleb.

00:21:50.279 --> 00:21:53.312
I'm sorry you felt like you had to hide that.

00:21:58.146 --> 00:22:01.662
LIAM: (inhales sharply) Well, I've been lying to you.

00:22:06.737 --> 00:22:07.987
And I am sorry.

00:22:10.060 --> 00:22:11.689
LAURA: We lie.

00:22:11.689 --> 00:22:15.181
We lie about things all the time to protect other people.

00:22:17.228 --> 00:22:19.569
Sometimes to protect ourselves.

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:26.762
I don't blame you for that.

00:22:34.577 --> 00:22:37.327
LIAM: Whatever we're doing here, I...

00:22:39.301 --> 00:22:44.168
I've come home in the hopes of atoning.

00:22:46.412 --> 00:22:47.245
And...

00:22:49.375 --> 00:22:51.875
That idea has evolved

00:22:53.158 --> 00:22:54.849
quite a bit over time.

00:22:57.142 --> 00:23:00.175
And I'm not sure what the exact answer is,

00:23:02.953 --> 00:23:04.620
but I mean to atone.

00:23:09.748 --> 00:23:12.564
ASHLEY: What does atonement look like to you, Caleb?

00:23:21.366 --> 00:23:24.449
LIAM: Well, I feel like

00:23:27.274 --> 00:23:29.683
the things that I've seen, no one should see.

00:23:37.038 --> 00:23:38.812
Never again.

00:23:38.812 --> 00:23:42.686
LAURA: So we should put a stop to it, then.

00:23:42.686 --> 00:23:45.175
LIAM: Well, it's complicated, isn't it?

00:23:46.609 --> 00:23:50.109
It's wrapped up in the ruling of a nation.

00:23:53.196 --> 00:23:56.446
MARISHA: You've come a long way since me, you,

00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:02.514
and Nott were huddled up in that hotel room.

00:24:05.537 --> 00:24:07.588
I said then you had a responsibility

00:24:07.588 --> 00:24:11.163
and that none of us would see you differently.

00:24:16.518 --> 00:24:18.904
TALIESIN: No one should be put through that.
ASHLEY: (quietly) No.

00:24:19.929 --> 00:24:22.226
MARISHA: No one blames you.

00:24:22.226 --> 00:24:23.059
LIAM: Well.

00:24:24.158 --> 00:24:25.258
One person.

00:24:28.976 --> 00:24:33.493
Anyway, I find it hard to imagine

00:24:33.493 --> 00:24:36.184
walking in there tomorrow and

00:24:37.151 --> 00:24:39.535
you not knowing the whole picture.

00:24:43.857 --> 00:24:45.740
(quietly) That's the whole picture.

00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:59.130
I want to learn a little bit what's going on

00:25:00.287 --> 00:25:02.562
in my colleagues' heads.

00:25:03.807 --> 00:25:05.694
MARISHA: We saw them.

00:25:05.694 --> 00:25:06.844
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

00:25:08.342 --> 00:25:09.869
MARISHA: We were handing off the beacon.

00:25:09.869 --> 00:25:11.036
They didn't...

00:25:13.035 --> 00:25:15.368
They looked pretty far gone.

00:25:20.314 --> 00:25:22.795
LIAM: I have to try.

00:25:22.795 --> 00:25:25.387
MARISHA: Think there's something redeemable?

00:25:25.387 --> 00:25:27.129
Think they're worth saving?

00:25:29.166 --> 00:25:31.765
LIAM: They're worth saving, yeah.

00:25:31.765 --> 00:25:34.348
Whether or not we can, I don't know.

00:25:35.553 --> 00:25:39.570
TRAVIS: Did they ever waiver, or have they remained

00:25:40.784 --> 00:25:43.034
believers this entire time?

00:25:46.331 --> 00:25:49.614
LIAM: Well, as children,

00:25:49.614 --> 00:25:50.447
no.

00:25:51.889 --> 00:25:53.097
Not to my recollection.

00:25:53.097 --> 00:25:56.589
We were very avid in our duties.

00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:01.170
LAURA: So you never wavered either.

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:06.663
LIAM: No.

00:26:08.992 --> 00:26:10.575
LAURA: And it was the...

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:17.720
the final act that made you change your beliefs?

00:26:31.874 --> 00:26:35.857
LIAM: So much time was put into
stamping me into a specific shape.

00:26:37.859 --> 00:26:41.767
It was comforting to know your place...

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.400
and serve...

00:26:51.117 --> 00:26:52.534
the greater good.

00:26:56.257 --> 00:26:57.565
But, uh...

00:27:00.515 --> 00:27:02.798
I-- I failed my people.

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:05.297
<i>My</i> people.

00:27:08.208 --> 00:27:09.822
TALIESIN: Feel like they failed you.

00:27:09.822 --> 00:27:12.652
LAURA: Yeah, your family sent you off to the Academy,

00:27:12.652 --> 00:27:13.652
didn't they?

00:27:15.077 --> 00:27:18.327
They believed those same things, right?

00:27:19.848 --> 00:27:21.257
LIAM: To a degree.

00:27:23.766 --> 00:27:28.765
Yes, my parents were very big
believers in the Empire, but...

00:27:31.307 --> 00:27:32.482
they also...

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:36.181
loved me.

00:27:37.354 --> 00:27:42.096
As wholly as your family, Caduceus, or yours.

00:27:45.325 --> 00:27:47.798
MARISHA: It's not a failure on your part.

00:27:47.798 --> 00:27:49.973
It's a failure on the Empire's.

00:27:53.314 --> 00:27:56.897
I don't think that it's by coincidence that

00:27:59.024 --> 00:28:02.856
your core beliefs that you were doing something

00:28:02.856 --> 00:28:04.539
for the greater good...

00:28:06.622 --> 00:28:09.697
led you to us and what we're doing now.

00:28:12.653 --> 00:28:14.070
<i>That's</i> the truth.

00:28:18.576 --> 00:28:21.744
LIAM: Well, it remains to be seen what we can do,

00:28:21.744 --> 00:28:23.686
but maybe we can do.

00:28:26.704 --> 00:28:28.784
MARISHA: Had this conversation with Fjord of the other night

00:28:28.784 --> 00:28:31.752
when we were still in Rumblecusp.

00:28:31.752 --> 00:28:33.669
Think we're doing good?

00:28:37.251 --> 00:28:39.584
What we're doing as a group?

00:28:41.791 --> 00:28:42.741
LIAM: I do.

00:28:47.171 --> 00:28:50.632
MARISHA: I mean, that's pretty dope, right?

00:28:50.632 --> 00:28:53.015
LIAM: Yeah, the Mighty Nein is...

00:28:53.015 --> 00:28:54.523
is pretty dope.

00:28:54.523 --> 00:28:57.308
TRAVIS and LAURA: (laugh)

00:28:57.308 --> 00:28:58.433
MARISHA: Fuck yeah.

00:29:01.616 --> 00:29:04.666
LIAM: The stage is a little bit bigger.

00:29:06.267 --> 00:29:07.934
ASHLEY: I have a question.

00:29:09.496 --> 00:29:11.997
Did they do this with every student at the Academy,

00:29:11.997 --> 00:29:14.897
or were you just a select few that was...

00:29:16.688 --> 00:29:18.376
chosen?

00:29:18.376 --> 00:29:21.276
LIAM: Trent has an eye for talent.

00:29:23.784 --> 00:29:28.175
And to my understanding, we were just the latest.

00:29:29.184 --> 00:29:32.629
We were not the first and we were not to be the last.

00:29:34.062 --> 00:29:36.895
TRAVIS: You three were a bit of a class?

00:29:38.923 --> 00:29:39.756
LIAM: Yeah.

00:29:42.355 --> 00:29:44.704
Boy, I have thought a lot about this for a long time

00:29:44.704 --> 00:29:47.515
and talked to no one about it.

00:29:47.515 --> 00:29:50.265
I don't know all the answers, but

00:29:51.315 --> 00:29:54.265
we certainly all came from humble means.

00:29:57.995 --> 00:30:00.245
No family name to speak of.

00:30:01.715 --> 00:30:04.215
I was very good at what I did.

00:30:05.173 --> 00:30:06.840
Even at a young age.

00:30:10.243 --> 00:30:14.734
Eadwulf was not only very capable,

00:30:14.734 --> 00:30:18.284
but he was strong,

00:30:18.284 --> 00:30:20.616
and I think that caught Trent's eye.

00:30:22.241 --> 00:30:23.324
And Astrid...

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:30.663
Maybe is a bit like...

00:30:33.129 --> 00:30:35.138
Trent, maybe that's unkind.

00:30:35.138 --> 00:30:37.046
She had a hunger.

00:30:39.646 --> 00:30:40.970
Ambition.

00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:44.828
LAURA: Do you think the Academy knows what he does?

00:30:44.828 --> 00:30:45.865
TRAVIS: Who, Trent?

00:30:45.865 --> 00:30:49.108
LAURA: Yeah, do you think like, Ludinus goes, "Okay, Trent,

00:30:49.108 --> 00:30:50.756
"now go find the people and now we'll have them

00:30:50.756 --> 00:30:53.324
"go do horrible things," or do you think it's like,

00:30:53.324 --> 00:30:56.857
he knows that Trent finds these good wizards

00:30:56.857 --> 00:30:58.653
and brings them up to the forefront.

00:30:58.653 --> 00:31:02.575
Do you think anybody else knows
the brutal things that he does?

00:31:02.575 --> 00:31:04.282
MARISHA: Someone knows.

00:31:04.282 --> 00:31:07.129
LIAM: The Academy I do not believe knows.

00:31:07.129 --> 00:31:09.745
The Assembly...
MARISHA: The Assembly, someone has to.

00:31:09.745 --> 00:31:12.461
LIAM: Some of them, Ludinus,

00:31:14.311 --> 00:31:16.519
intimated that he had some idea.

00:31:17.681 --> 00:31:20.401
LAURA: Well, I hate them all now.

00:31:20.401 --> 00:31:21.920
TRAVIS: Just so I have it clear.

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:25.460
We're going to try and redeem Astrid and Eadwulf,

00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:28.068
but Trent, fuck him, right?

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:30.957
Or are you trying to...

00:31:33.889 --> 00:31:36.889
MARISHA: Yeah, I mean, it's always been a fuck Trent, right?

00:31:36.889 --> 00:31:38.472
TRAVIS: Just to be clear.

00:31:40.917 --> 00:31:42.686
LAURA: Oh no, do you sort of like Trent?

00:31:42.686 --> 00:31:44.291
Do you have like some weird thing

00:31:44.291 --> 00:31:47.474
because he like treated you nice a long time ago?

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:52.734
TALIESIN: I think a goal is always better than a grudge.

00:31:52.734 --> 00:31:54.329
What's the goal?

00:31:54.329 --> 00:31:55.912
TRAVIS: That's very fair.

00:31:57.660 --> 00:31:59.993
TALIESIN: I have my theories.
LIAM: Yeah.

00:32:01.892 --> 00:32:05.252
I have said many times that I would like

00:32:05.252 --> 00:32:07.077
to surgically remove...

00:32:08.768 --> 00:32:10.935
the bad parts. It's not all bad here.

00:32:12.104 --> 00:32:15.670
TALIESIN: But--
LIAM: But it seems impossible.

00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:17.515
TALIESIN: This can't go on.

00:32:17.515 --> 00:32:19.958
No more of this.
LIAM: It could go on.

00:32:19.958 --> 00:32:22.107
It has for a long time.

00:32:22.107 --> 00:32:23.978
TALIESIN: Well, there's a goal.
LIAM: Yeah.

00:32:23.978 --> 00:32:25.078
TALIESIN: No more.

00:32:27.588 --> 00:32:32.580
LIAM: Whether that means exposing him or stopping him,

00:32:34.657 --> 00:32:37.537
maybe we will land on that, but I need to know more

00:32:37.537 --> 00:32:41.954
about what different members of the Assembly believe.

00:32:43.897 --> 00:32:47.064
MARISHA: If he's been teaching for that long,

00:32:48.265 --> 00:32:51.857
is there a chance that there are members in the Assembly

00:32:51.857 --> 00:32:54.367
who were his student at one point in time?

00:32:54.367 --> 00:32:55.551
LAURA: But just because you're his student

00:32:55.551 --> 00:32:57.648
doesn't mean that you're one of his proteges, right?

00:32:57.648 --> 00:33:00.012
TALIESIN: Is there a chance there's more like you?

00:33:01.545 --> 00:33:03.204
MARISHA: That's what I'm kind of getting at.

00:33:03.204 --> 00:33:04.636
TALIESIN: Got away.

00:33:04.636 --> 00:33:07.578
MARISHA: Maybe there are more allies out there.

00:33:07.578 --> 00:33:11.258
LIAM: That's a very good question. I do not know the answer.

00:33:12.366 --> 00:33:15.393
I spent a very long time trying to stay

00:33:15.393 --> 00:33:17.393
as far away as possible.

00:33:19.835 --> 00:33:22.085
TALIESIN: Quite possibly not alone.

00:33:25.854 --> 00:33:27.137
LIAM: Well...

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:32.144
I take a lot of faith by what
we achieved on the ocean.

00:33:35.286 --> 00:33:38.269
This nation doesn't need to be...

00:33:39.302 --> 00:33:40.868
steeped in fear.

00:33:45.303 --> 00:33:49.404
The Empire has slighted the Dynasty, it has taken

00:33:49.404 --> 00:33:54.104
a cherished religious artifact from them.

00:33:55.650 --> 00:33:56.919
Bloodshed is stopped because we

00:33:56.919 --> 00:33:59.319
merely gave them what was theirs.

00:34:02.274 --> 00:34:05.158
If that is not a lesson for people in power,

00:34:08.982 --> 00:34:11.490
maybe they do not deserve the power.

00:34:16.738 --> 00:34:21.655
Or maybe this system is too corrupt, I don't know.

00:34:21.655 --> 00:34:25.841
MARISHA: I think it depends on
how deep the corruption has gone.

00:34:25.841 --> 00:34:27.591
If it's worth saving.

00:34:29.432 --> 00:34:31.871
If something's too far poisoned, maybe it's better

00:34:31.871 --> 00:34:35.063
to burn it to the ground and start something fresh.

00:34:38.199 --> 00:34:39.857
LIAM: You and your brethren,

00:34:42.774 --> 00:34:44.083
you dabble in this.

00:34:44.083 --> 00:34:45.882
MARISHA: It's more or less what we do.
LIAM: Yeah.

00:34:45.882 --> 00:34:47.931
MARISHA: It's kind of our mission
statement that I just said.

00:34:47.931 --> 00:34:49.306
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

00:34:51.234 --> 00:34:52.484
Would they...

00:34:56.475 --> 00:34:58.642
if he needs to be cut out.

00:35:01.198 --> 00:35:03.656
MARISHA: Oh yeah.
LIAM: Would they stand by?

00:35:03.656 --> 00:35:04.589
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:35:06.206 --> 00:35:07.795
The Cobalt Soul and the Cerberus Assembly

00:35:07.795 --> 00:35:10.653
have butted heads for decades.

00:35:12.285 --> 00:35:14.894
It's kind of the checks and balances system.

00:35:14.894 --> 00:35:19.493
And I just to try-- just try to not let myself

00:35:19.493 --> 00:35:24.410
be too naive to the fact that corruption exists everywhere.

00:35:25.943 --> 00:35:28.443
I think I can be an expositor,

00:35:29.704 --> 00:35:32.537
utilize the resources given to me,

00:35:34.453 --> 00:35:36.887
and not have to be blind to the flaws.

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:41.426
LIAM: What about taint within the Cobalt Soul?

00:35:41.426 --> 00:35:42.571
Possible?

00:35:42.571 --> 00:35:44.184
MARISHA: Of course.

00:35:44.184 --> 00:35:45.875
LIAM: Have you seen it?

00:35:47.903 --> 00:35:48.736
MARISHA: No.

00:35:51.009 --> 00:35:52.047
Not to my knowledge.

00:35:52.047 --> 00:35:55.115
Not to my knowledge, not really?

00:35:55.115 --> 00:35:58.244
MATT: If there has been, it's been dealt with so swiftly

00:35:58.244 --> 00:36:01.328
that by the time anyone discovers, it's already gone.

00:36:01.328 --> 00:36:03.761
Or it's so far up the chain that nobody knows.

00:36:03.761 --> 00:36:04.594
MARISHA: Right.

00:36:04.594 --> 00:36:08.245
MATT: I mean, it's hard to tell at a certain point.

00:36:08.245 --> 00:36:12.055
But as far as you know-- there are those, of course,

00:36:12.055 --> 00:36:16.188
with any sort of structure that do fall to corruption,

00:36:16.188 --> 00:36:20.272
but because it is a worldwide network,

00:36:22.498 --> 00:36:24.098
there's a lot more--
MARISHA: A bit more accountability.

00:36:24.098 --> 00:36:28.573
MATT: There's a lot more accountability
than other, more locally political structures.

00:36:28.573 --> 00:36:31.204
So it has a higher success rate.

00:36:33.716 --> 00:36:36.460
MARISHA: It's the common belief in the Soul

00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:38.900
to share what knowledge is known.

00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:40.959
Especially amongst the branches.

00:36:43.759 --> 00:36:46.573
LIAM: (inhales, sighs)

00:36:46.573 --> 00:36:51.573
Well, tomorrow night can be a first step, but

00:36:51.625 --> 00:36:55.145
one, I need Veth.

00:36:55.145 --> 00:36:57.120
And two, we are...

00:36:59.053 --> 00:36:59.886
rode hard.

00:36:59.886 --> 00:37:02.938
We cannot show up tomorrow night looking like this.

00:37:04.305 --> 00:37:05.138
MARISHA: Oh.

00:37:07.263 --> 00:37:09.727
Should I take the pooka shell necklace off, then?

00:37:09.727 --> 00:37:12.061
(laughter)

00:37:12.061 --> 00:37:13.052
All right.

00:37:13.052 --> 00:37:14.339
LAURA: I think it's that good look.

00:37:14.339 --> 00:37:15.289
MARISHA: Thanks.

00:37:15.289 --> 00:37:17.197
TALIESIN: The urge to show up in the Dynasty finest

00:37:17.197 --> 00:37:19.125
is almost overpowering.

00:37:19.125 --> 00:37:21.808
MARISHA and TALIESIN: (laugh)

00:37:21.808 --> 00:37:23.473
MARISHA: We talked about going back tonight for dinner

00:37:23.473 --> 00:37:25.069
and getting ceviche.

00:37:25.069 --> 00:37:26.014
LAURA: That's true.

00:37:26.014 --> 00:37:30.418
We could go back to Nicodranas and clean up real good,

00:37:30.418 --> 00:37:34.955
you know. Got lots of fancy clothes at the Lavish Chateau.

00:37:34.955 --> 00:37:38.625
TALIESIN: We still have those outfits, don't we, there?

00:37:38.625 --> 00:37:40.327
LAURA: Our evening wear?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:37:40.327 --> 00:37:41.160
LAURA: Oh yeah.

00:37:42.897 --> 00:37:44.804
MARISHA: Did he say that the dress was formal?

00:37:44.804 --> 00:37:46.494
Is that a thing?

00:37:46.494 --> 00:37:47.661
Do we hafta?

00:37:50.457 --> 00:37:53.236
I'm just curious if it was stated.

00:37:53.236 --> 00:37:54.533
LIAM: No, it was not.

00:37:54.533 --> 00:37:56.249
LAURA: Not formal, or not stated?

00:37:56.249 --> 00:37:57.862
LIAM: Not stated.

00:37:57.862 --> 00:38:00.244
LAURA: I think you should step it up

00:38:00.244 --> 00:38:02.577
and make them feel underdressed.

00:38:02.577 --> 00:38:04.705
MARISHA: That's true, that's true.

00:38:04.705 --> 00:38:07.497
LAURA: We are fully outnumbering them,

00:38:07.497 --> 00:38:11.638
so they will feel out of place in their own home.

00:38:12.982 --> 00:38:14.565
TALIESIN: Do clean up well.

00:38:15.872 --> 00:38:18.030
TRAVIS: They wouldn't poison us, would they?

00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:20.876
TALIESIN: I'll try and be prepared for that.

00:38:20.876 --> 00:38:22.726
LAURA: Oh, yes, yes.
TRAVIS: (nervous laugh)

00:38:23.981 --> 00:38:24.894
Okay.

00:38:24.894 --> 00:38:27.901
MARISHA: I could also be the taste tester, right?

00:38:29.209 --> 00:38:31.682
TRAVIS: Do you have some monk shit where you're--

00:38:31.682 --> 00:38:33.239
LAURA: Would you know if you'd been poisoned?

00:38:33.239 --> 00:38:35.747
MARISHA: I can will poison out of my pores.

00:38:35.747 --> 00:38:36.975
TRAVIS: Sure you can.

00:38:36.975 --> 00:38:40.002
LAURA: Ew, I bet it smells so bad after you do it, though.

00:38:40.002 --> 00:38:41.037
MARISHA: Oh yeah.

00:38:41.037 --> 00:38:43.472
TALIESIN: Does your sweat smell after that?
MARISHA: Yeah, like--

00:38:43.472 --> 00:38:44.538
MATT: Like you've eaten a lot of garlic.

00:38:44.538 --> 00:38:45.911
MARISHA: I was going to say rotten mushrooms.

00:38:45.911 --> 00:38:48.976
You ever leave a pot of mushrooms on the stove for too long?

00:38:48.976 --> 00:38:51.468
LIAM: Maybe it smells like asparagus pee?

00:38:51.468 --> 00:38:53.094
MATT: There you go, there you go.

00:38:54.386 --> 00:38:57.278
LAURA: Like definite, like you know.

00:38:57.278 --> 00:38:58.760
(laughter)

00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:00.880
It was poison; she was definitely poisoned.

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:03.482
(groaning)

00:39:03.482 --> 00:39:05.662
MARISHA: The pheromone, it's a defense mechanism.

00:39:05.662 --> 00:39:06.495
MATT: Oh god.

00:39:08.597 --> 00:39:09.613
All right.

00:39:09.613 --> 00:39:11.900
LAURA: Do you know that only happens to some people?

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:12.733
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:39:12.733 --> 00:39:13.566
MARISHA: The asparagus and pee thing?

00:39:13.566 --> 00:39:16.988
LAURA: Yeah, not everybody gets the asparagus pee smell.

00:39:16.988 --> 00:39:19.945
MATT: Weird.
LIAM: Some people named Liam.

00:39:19.945 --> 00:39:21.877
(laughter)

00:39:21.877 --> 00:39:23.556
MATT: â™ª The more you know â™ª

00:39:23.556 --> 00:39:25.668
(laughter)

00:39:25.668 --> 00:39:29.545
MATT: Well, you have, effectively, a day and a half or so

00:39:29.545 --> 00:39:31.995
until that dinner invitation.

00:39:31.995 --> 00:39:33.770
So what would you like to do in the interim?

00:39:34.697 --> 00:39:36.567
LAURA: Do you want me to send a message

00:39:36.567 --> 00:39:38.545
to Trent and let him know that we'll be there?

00:39:38.545 --> 00:39:41.295
I can ask what the dress code is.

00:39:44.557 --> 00:39:46.247
LIAM: I think there is nothing I would love more

00:39:46.247 --> 00:39:50.292
than for you to send a message to Master Ikithon

00:39:50.292 --> 00:39:51.494
accepting his invitation.

00:39:51.494 --> 00:39:53.153
LAURA: You got it, Caleb.

00:39:57.277 --> 00:39:58.539
I'm going to send a message.

00:39:58.539 --> 00:40:00.147
MATT: Okay. (laughs)

00:40:02.908 --> 00:40:05.339
LAURA: Dearest Trent!

00:40:05.339 --> 00:40:08.185
Hey, got your message to Caleb.

00:40:08.185 --> 00:40:10.832
We will def be there.

00:40:10.832 --> 00:40:14.484
Can't wait to see what your house looks like.

00:40:15.501 --> 00:40:16.635
Any dress code?

00:40:16.635 --> 00:40:18.224
SAM and LIAM: Ooh!

00:40:18.224 --> 00:40:20.793
ASHLEY: Dang!

00:40:20.793 --> 00:40:22.809
LAURA: I'm getting good at this, you guys!
LIAM: Stuck the landing.

00:40:22.809 --> 00:40:23.759
MARISHA: Growth!

00:40:24.827 --> 00:40:27.136
MATT: A rapid response comes.

00:40:28.477 --> 00:40:33.477
"Ah. Well then, I look forward to seeing all of you.

00:40:34.108 --> 00:40:36.602
"No particular dress code.

00:40:36.602 --> 00:40:39.352
"Wear what is comfortable, please."

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:41.623
That's all.

00:40:41.623 --> 00:40:44.298
TALIESIN: Fancy.
TRAVIS: 19 words, pretty good.

00:40:44.298 --> 00:40:47.125
LAURA: He's got a slimy, slimy voice,

00:40:47.125 --> 00:40:50.766
but he says we can wear whatever's comfortable.

00:40:50.766 --> 00:40:52.661
I say we wear formal wear.

00:40:53.602 --> 00:40:54.755
TALIESIN: Agreed.

00:40:54.755 --> 00:40:55.768
MARISHA: I'm into that.

00:40:55.768 --> 00:40:56.793
TRAVIS: Ugh.

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:00.803
LAURA: Or should we wear our armor?

00:41:00.803 --> 00:41:02.021
That might be important.

00:41:02.021 --> 00:41:05.353
TRAVIS: Just-- I'm going into an enemy's house, you know.

00:41:05.353 --> 00:41:08.480
LAURA: We can wear our armor and then some fancy accents.

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:09.720
How about that?

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:12.818
MARISHA: Do you have any, like, rip away dresses, you know?

00:41:12.818 --> 00:41:16.051
So we can, like, wear our gear, but then be like...

00:41:16.051 --> 00:41:17.621
TALIESIN: Technically, aren't in all clothes rip away,

00:41:17.621 --> 00:41:18.553
if you're strong enough?

00:41:18.553 --> 00:41:20.479
TRAVIS: Ha ha!

00:41:20.479 --> 00:41:21.539
MARISHA: You're right.

00:41:21.539 --> 00:41:23.063
LAURA: (laughs)

00:41:23.063 --> 00:41:23.896
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:41:23.896 --> 00:41:24.957
TALIESIN: I'll do this real good, hold on.

00:41:24.957 --> 00:41:27.475
LIAM: But seriously, please treat this

00:41:27.475 --> 00:41:29.813
like we are going in on a fact-finding mission,

00:41:29.813 --> 00:41:33.305
but also be prepared for it to be a total bloodbath.

00:41:33.305 --> 00:41:34.138
LAURA: Got it.
TALIESIN: Always.

00:41:34.138 --> 00:41:37.061
TRAVIS: Good, good parameters.
LAURA: Be prepared for murder.

00:41:37.061 --> 00:41:38.312
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:41:38.312 --> 00:41:42.353
LAURA: So wait, is our goal to murder him tomorrow night?

00:41:42.353 --> 00:41:43.965
Should we, if there's an opportunity,

00:41:43.965 --> 00:41:46.866
should we just murder him?

00:41:46.866 --> 00:41:49.836
LIAM: Let's make that plan G.

00:41:49.836 --> 00:41:51.094
TRAVIS: G.

00:41:51.094 --> 00:41:52.344
LIAM: For tomorrow.

00:41:53.794 --> 00:41:56.857
TALIESIN: I'm very proud of you;
I was expecting that to be plan C.

00:41:56.857 --> 00:41:59.020
Plan G, that's growth.

00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:02.109
LIAM: Well, we need to figure out if there are

00:42:02.109 --> 00:42:03.759
more people to murder.

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:06.048
So.
LAURA: Okay.

00:42:06.048 --> 00:42:07.967
TALIESIN: Or people who've been waiting for the moment

00:42:07.967 --> 00:42:11.537
to get out from under his thumb.

00:42:11.537 --> 00:42:12.756
LIAM: We just need to know more.

00:42:12.756 --> 00:42:16.250
LAURA: Do you think all this time that maybe, like--

00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:20.455
Do you feel like when you were here,

00:42:20.455 --> 00:42:24.143
do you feel like you were being controlled?

00:42:24.143 --> 00:42:25.945
Or do you-- was it, like, your choice?

00:42:25.945 --> 00:42:30.159
Do you feel like maybe they, like, were subtly

00:42:30.159 --> 00:42:32.919
controlling you and you just didn't know?

00:42:34.277 --> 00:42:35.110
MARISHA: Oh no.

00:42:36.338 --> 00:42:37.421
LIAM: No, Jester.

00:42:41.479 --> 00:42:42.312
No.

00:42:44.855 --> 00:42:48.563
I am a different person

00:42:48.563 --> 00:42:51.504
in every way.

00:42:53.607 --> 00:42:55.390
I relished my work.

00:42:58.335 --> 00:43:00.002
We were riding high.

00:43:02.788 --> 00:43:04.363
Serving the king.

00:43:07.231 --> 00:43:08.515
Tasting power.

00:43:11.837 --> 00:43:13.145
This is why it...

00:43:16.246 --> 00:43:18.055
This is why I have never...

00:43:19.923 --> 00:43:21.006
It's hard.

00:43:22.666 --> 00:43:23.727
MARISHA: I think that was the first time

00:43:23.727 --> 00:43:27.076
I've ever heard you admit or recognize

00:43:27.076 --> 00:43:29.776
that you were a different person back then.

00:43:35.393 --> 00:43:36.537
Good work.

00:43:36.537 --> 00:43:38.470
LAURA: (laughs)

00:43:44.067 --> 00:43:46.123
MARISHA: Ceviche?

00:43:46.123 --> 00:43:48.745
LIAM: Yeah, how do we want to do this?

00:43:48.745 --> 00:43:50.797
MARISHA: Do you have a thingy? You said you have a thingy.

00:43:50.797 --> 00:43:55.339
LIAM: Yeah, I have a thingy. We could impose on

00:43:55.339 --> 00:43:57.580
our wizard friend again, or we could just

00:43:57.580 --> 00:43:59.747
go straight to your house.

00:44:00.982 --> 00:44:03.413
LAURA: Let's go straight to the house. Why not?

00:44:03.413 --> 00:44:05.504
TALIESIN: Let's do that thing
while we're at your house, by the way.

00:44:05.504 --> 00:44:07.402
The poof.

00:44:07.402 --> 00:44:12.402
Where we make the circle and then the teleporty thingy.

00:44:12.615 --> 00:44:14.462
LAURA: The teleporty thingy at the house?

00:44:14.462 --> 00:44:16.626
TALIESIN: At your mom's house, we could set up the--

00:44:16.626 --> 00:44:17.924
LAURA: Oh, we can make our thingy!

00:44:17.924 --> 00:44:19.076
TALIESIN: Yeah, the thingy.

00:44:19.076 --> 00:44:20.739
LAURA: I love it. Okay.
TALIESIN: We'll do that.

00:44:20.739 --> 00:44:22.995
LAURA: We have to make it a little temple, you know.

00:44:22.995 --> 00:44:24.248
TALIESIN: I love making little temples.

00:44:24.248 --> 00:44:25.089
LAURA: Okay.

00:44:25.089 --> 00:44:26.694
TRAVIS: Oh, by the way, when we went shopping,

00:44:26.694 --> 00:44:28.737
we bought two regular healing potions.

00:44:28.737 --> 00:44:31.161
Does anyone not have one?

00:44:31.161 --> 00:44:32.327
LAURA: Oh.
TALIESIN: Rummaging through my bag.

00:44:32.327 --> 00:44:34.464
LAURA: I don't think I have a healing potion.

00:44:34.464 --> 00:44:36.582
Maybe I do, hold on.

00:44:36.582 --> 00:44:38.848
ASHLEY: Up for grabs.

00:44:38.848 --> 00:44:40.238
Is that all we got?

00:44:40.238 --> 00:44:41.170
TRAVIS: Yeah, we only got two.

00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:42.640
LAURA: Oh, I've got a healing potion.

00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:44.676
TRAVIS: And some dope-ass jewelry.

00:44:44.676 --> 00:44:46.103
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:44:46.103 --> 00:44:47.750
LAURA: That is a really beautiful ring.

00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:49.212
TRAVIS: Thank you.

00:44:49.212 --> 00:44:50.787
Got it for a steal.

00:44:51.675 --> 00:44:53.704
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:44:53.704 --> 00:44:55.915
ASHLEY: Wait, how many of those...?

00:44:55.915 --> 00:44:56.846
TRAVIS: Two, two and two.

00:44:56.846 --> 00:44:58.618
ASHLEY: No, the--
TRAVIS: Yeah, the fire?

00:44:58.618 --> 00:44:59.782
ASHLEY: The fire things.
TRAVIS: <i>Dos.</i>

00:44:59.782 --> 00:45:01.280
ASHLEY: I thought we got more than that.

00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:03.373
I thought it was like a pack of...

00:45:03.373 --> 00:45:04.391
TRAVIS: This shithead said two.

00:45:04.391 --> 00:45:05.451
I don't know, I thought it was two.

00:45:05.451 --> 00:45:06.576
LAURA: I thought it was a box

00:45:06.576 --> 00:45:08.913
with two balls in 'em.

00:45:08.913 --> 00:45:09.754
Is that right?

00:45:09.754 --> 00:45:11.475
TRAVIS: Alchemical fire? Alchemist fire?

00:45:11.475 --> 00:45:12.308
MATT: Alchemist fire?

00:45:12.308 --> 00:45:14.642
LAURA: It was a box with one, two balls.

00:45:16.157 --> 00:45:17.791
MARISHA: I feel like it was a 12 pack or an eight--

00:45:17.791 --> 00:45:19.191
LAURA: Was it?
ASHLEY: I feel like it was a 12 packer. Yeah.

00:45:19.191 --> 00:45:21.732
MATT: It was a fair amount of them.

00:45:21.732 --> 00:45:23.323
LAURA: Oh shit.
MATT: I rely on you guys

00:45:23.323 --> 00:45:25.124
to keep track of the items once they get to you.
TRAVIS: I thought you were taking notes.

00:45:25.124 --> 00:45:27.082
You taking notes? I thought I was...

00:45:28.299 --> 00:45:29.407
Marisha takes notes.

00:45:29.407 --> 00:45:31.262
ASHLEY: Listen, I have one celebone,

00:45:31.262 --> 00:45:33.897
two oops-stones, and two chuckle dust.

00:45:33.897 --> 00:45:36.961
Those are the only things I wrote down that I had.

00:45:36.961 --> 00:45:37.794
TRAVIS: Yep.
MATT: Well then, you better

00:45:37.794 --> 00:45:39.811
not use them until you confirm with Dani, then.

00:45:39.811 --> 00:45:42.308
TRAVIS: I'll go consult the Loremaster.

00:45:42.308 --> 00:45:44.275
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm going to find this out.

00:45:44.275 --> 00:45:45.641
MARISHA: Just Slack Dani.

00:45:45.641 --> 00:45:47.321
LAURA: She'll know. Text her.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:45:47.321 --> 00:45:49.958
(laughter)

00:45:49.958 --> 00:45:50.791
MATT: All right.

00:45:50.791 --> 00:45:54.374
LIAM: All right. So I will pull out the little turtle statue

00:45:54.374 --> 00:45:55.893
that Jester gave me from her home,

00:45:55.893 --> 00:45:58.892
and grip it in my hand and--
LAURA: Don't crush it!

00:45:58.892 --> 00:46:03.059
LIAM: Oh, my grip is so weak. I have a Strength of 10.

00:46:04.326 --> 00:46:06.224
And--
LAURA: And don't let it hurt you.

00:46:06.224 --> 00:46:07.875
(laughter)

00:46:07.875 --> 00:46:11.643
LIAM: It is in fact jabbing straight through my palm.

00:46:11.643 --> 00:46:14.698
The circle took some futzing, but this is instantaneous.

00:46:14.698 --> 00:46:17.950
So he just mutters a few words and then whoosh.

00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:21.158
LAURA: All of us? Do we have to
be holding hands or anything?

00:46:21.158 --> 00:46:22.499
MATT: I do not believe you have to be holding hands.

00:46:22.499 --> 00:46:23.406
TALIESIN: We can.

00:46:23.406 --> 00:46:24.662
LAURA: Oh. Just to be safe.

00:46:24.662 --> 00:46:26.526
MATT: Right, for this one?
LIAM: No.

00:46:26.526 --> 00:46:28.236
LAURA: Okay, wow. We just whirl.
LIAM: Verbal?

00:46:28.236 --> 00:46:29.640
TRAVIS: Caleb just disappears.

00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:32.122
(laughter)
LAURA: Well, that sucks.

00:46:32.122 --> 00:46:33.264
LIAM: Later, bitches!

00:46:33.264 --> 00:46:35.388
(laughter)

00:46:35.388 --> 00:46:37.113
TALIESIN: Ah, man.
LAURA: Ceviche!

00:46:37.113 --> 00:46:38.382
TRAVIS: This is part of it, right? This is part of it?

00:46:38.382 --> 00:46:39.215
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: This is part of it?

00:46:39.215 --> 00:46:40.962
This is part of it.

00:46:40.962 --> 00:46:41.795
MATT: Yeah, you don't have to touch hands.

00:46:41.795 --> 00:46:43.020
You have to do it within 10 feet of you.

00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:44.126
LAURA: Okay.

00:46:44.126 --> 00:46:47.351
MATT: So yes, as you all gather in a small circle,

00:46:47.351 --> 00:46:48.708
Caleb mutters something under his breath

00:46:48.708 --> 00:46:53.233
and then, no circle on the ground, no extended preparation,

00:46:53.233 --> 00:46:56.479
you all just suddenly feel that that drifting sensation

00:46:56.479 --> 00:46:58.973
in your stomach, that brief rising,

00:46:58.973 --> 00:47:01.311
almost weightless sensation for a split second,

00:47:01.311 --> 00:47:05.518
and then with a blink of light-- where are they?

00:47:05.518 --> 00:47:07.935
LIAM: We are in the lobby of the Lavish Chateau.

00:47:07.935 --> 00:47:09.829
MATT: (boof) You guys are now right in the center

00:47:09.829 --> 00:47:12.588
of the now shaded interior of the Lavish Chateau,

00:47:12.588 --> 00:47:14.500
midday in Nicodranas.

00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:15.884
LAURA: (gasps)

00:47:15.884 --> 00:47:16.991
MATT: As you land there, you can hear

00:47:16.991 --> 00:47:18.321
there's a little bit of music playing.

00:47:18.321 --> 00:47:19.573
It's not too terribly crowded.

00:47:19.573 --> 00:47:20.972
There's maybe like four individuals

00:47:20.972 --> 00:47:23.871
that are in from their dock work just getting a drink.

00:47:23.871 --> 00:47:24.704
A little higher than their pay grade,

00:47:24.704 --> 00:47:28.067
but because they like the way it's made here.

00:47:28.067 --> 00:47:29.628
Also, momentarily you hear what sounds like

00:47:29.628 --> 00:47:32.491
a (boof, barking).

00:47:32.491 --> 00:47:33.324
LAURA: (gasps)

00:47:33.324 --> 00:47:36.462
MATT: And you glance over and see Nugget just

00:47:36.462 --> 00:47:37.604
apparate as well.

00:47:37.604 --> 00:47:39.945
LAURA: Nugget!
MATT: (panting, yips)

00:47:39.945 --> 00:47:41.553
Then runs up and like...

00:47:41.553 --> 00:47:42.873
(sniffing)

00:47:42.873 --> 00:47:45.374
LAURA: It's me. It's Jester.
MATT: (yips)

00:47:45.374 --> 00:47:47.124
LAURA: Your original mommy,

00:47:47.124 --> 00:47:48.469
but I understand if you don't feel like

00:47:48.469 --> 00:47:50.295
I'm your mommy anymore.

00:47:51.435 --> 00:47:53.246
MATT: Just starts licking your hand.

00:47:53.246 --> 00:47:55.015
Now, Nugget's been gone here for quite some time

00:47:55.015 --> 00:47:57.874
being watched by Marion, and is significantly larger

00:47:57.874 --> 00:48:00.834
than you last remember him being.

00:48:00.834 --> 00:48:02.996
Still nowhere near a full grown blink dog,

00:48:02.996 --> 00:48:05.292
but in between the period, maybe, you know,

00:48:05.292 --> 00:48:07.343
from nose to tail about that big.

00:48:07.343 --> 00:48:11.215
And so is still like a bit of an unwieldy creature

00:48:11.215 --> 00:48:12.250
for the expectation.

00:48:12.250 --> 00:48:14.276
LAURA: I like to think that Nugget blinks back and forth

00:48:14.276 --> 00:48:17.396
between the Lavish Chateau and Veth's family home.

00:48:17.396 --> 00:48:19.028
MATT: Yeah, we'll say for the past, you know,

00:48:19.028 --> 00:48:21.231
number of hours, with your arrival,

00:48:21.231 --> 00:48:25.026
there's been a bit of-- especially with Luc living here,

00:48:25.026 --> 00:48:28.941
Luc has taken a personal interest in playing with Nugget

00:48:28.941 --> 00:48:31.569
in the time that he spent here.
TRAVIS: How do Sprinkle and Nugget get along?

00:48:31.569 --> 00:48:32.801
SAM: Well, one's alive.

00:48:32.801 --> 00:48:35.475
(laughter)

00:48:35.475 --> 00:48:37.004
LAURA: I brought you a chew toy!

00:48:37.004 --> 00:48:39.016
SAM: Nugget comes over to our house

00:48:39.016 --> 00:48:40.507
and just poops and then goes back.

00:48:40.507 --> 00:48:41.662
MATT: Yeah, yeah.

00:48:41.662 --> 00:48:42.820
SAM: What the fuck?

00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:45.359
(laughter)

00:48:45.359 --> 00:48:47.935
MATT: Yeza's like, "It's been an experience."

00:48:47.935 --> 00:48:49.225
(laughter)

00:48:49.225 --> 00:48:50.084
TRAVIS: Every morning.

00:48:50.084 --> 00:48:52.637
MATT: "Hard to catch him, the... asshole."

00:48:52.637 --> 00:48:54.215
But yeah, nevertheless, you are here in the Chateau,

00:48:54.215 --> 00:48:56.341
Nicodranas is your oyster.

00:48:57.399 --> 00:48:59.442
MARISHA: Should we crash Veth?

00:48:59.442 --> 00:49:00.866
LIAM: Yeah.
MARISHA: The Brenatto family?

00:49:00.866 --> 00:49:01.789
See what they're up to?

00:49:01.789 --> 00:49:03.815
LAURA: Oh, I should find out exactly where she lives.

00:49:03.815 --> 00:49:05.683
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
LAURA: I'll go ask Mama.

00:49:05.683 --> 00:49:07.288
And I run upstairs with Nugget.

00:49:07.288 --> 00:49:08.538
MATT: You run upstairs.

00:49:08.538 --> 00:49:09.652
As you're running up the stairs with Nugget,

00:49:09.652 --> 00:49:12.393
you hear (thudding) and then his footfalls stop

00:49:12.393 --> 00:49:13.959
and you look up and he's already waiting for you

00:49:13.959 --> 00:49:15.010
at the top of the landing.

00:49:15.010 --> 00:49:17.510
LAURA: You're such a cool dog!
MATT: (panting)

00:49:18.389 --> 00:49:20.662
You head up into the room, and as you--

00:49:20.662 --> 00:49:22.362
Do you knock on the door or just push in?

00:49:22.362 --> 00:49:23.862
LAURA: Mm-hmm.
MATT: Which do you do?

00:49:24.838 --> 00:49:25.907
LAURA: Knock on the door and push in.

00:49:25.907 --> 00:49:28.831
(laughter)
MATT: Okay.

00:49:28.831 --> 00:49:30.750
As you go inside, you can see your mother

00:49:30.750 --> 00:49:33.421
is currently sitting at her little vanity

00:49:33.421 --> 00:49:35.838
and is in the process of brushing her hair back

00:49:35.838 --> 00:49:38.741
and turns around and goes, "Oh Jester, you're back already."

00:49:38.741 --> 00:49:39.574
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:49:39.574 --> 00:49:42.324
You know, we can just come now whenever.

00:49:42.324 --> 00:49:45.463
Literally, we can just stop in for a night all the time now.

00:49:45.463 --> 00:49:48.715
MATT: "Well, you're welcome to come
whenever you wish to, please.

00:49:48.715 --> 00:49:50.562
"Anytime."
LAURA: Should we let you know?

00:49:50.562 --> 00:49:53.328
MATT: "Maybe just for the sake of--

00:49:53.328 --> 00:49:54.478
"might be a very busy night,

00:49:54.478 --> 00:49:56.088
"but if you're coming to visit,

00:49:56.088 --> 00:49:58.578
"give me a little bit of a heads up and I am

00:49:58.578 --> 00:50:00.656
"more than happy to have you.

00:50:00.656 --> 00:50:02.043
"That is wonderful news."

00:50:02.043 --> 00:50:04.202
LAURA: Yeah, so we can just stay here tonight,

00:50:04.202 --> 00:50:05.879
and we're going to have some dinner.

00:50:05.879 --> 00:50:07.710
We're going to check out-- oh, we're going to check out

00:50:07.710 --> 00:50:10.062
Veth's house, I should probably find out where that is.

00:50:10.062 --> 00:50:11.390
MATT: "Oh, right this way."
LAURA: Okay.

00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:13.739
MATT: She stands up and tucks her little stool

00:50:13.739 --> 00:50:15.537
beneath the vanity, leads you over to the balcony

00:50:15.537 --> 00:50:17.613
and points across the way of the open,

00:50:17.613 --> 00:50:18.682
the section of the Opal Archways,

00:50:18.682 --> 00:50:19.858
from where the Lavish Chateau is,

00:50:19.858 --> 00:50:23.692
there is this very circular-style

00:50:23.692 --> 00:50:26.204
there is this very circular-style

00:50:26.204 --> 00:50:29.593
thoroughfare, like this of main plaza area in the center

00:50:29.593 --> 00:50:31.442
where there's a fountain, and you can see there's

00:50:31.442 --> 00:50:33.159
a number of these silk streamers that attach

00:50:33.159 --> 00:50:36.557
from the top of the fountain
to the different corners of this region.

00:50:36.557 --> 00:50:39.665
She points over to this one collection of buildings

00:50:39.665 --> 00:50:44.605
that have abodes in both floors and series.

00:50:44.605 --> 00:50:46.389
It looks the equivalent of an apartment complex,

00:50:46.389 --> 00:50:47.502
if you will.

00:50:47.502 --> 00:50:50.348
But very, very well built and beautiful,

00:50:50.348 --> 00:50:52.080
and points over towards the corner and goes,

00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:54.573
"That is where the Brenattos have been living."

00:50:54.573 --> 00:50:56.177
LAURA: Oh, perfect.

00:50:56.177 --> 00:50:58.416
We will go over there, but I'll be back, okay?

00:50:58.416 --> 00:50:59.249
MATT: "Of course.

00:50:59.249 --> 00:51:00.601
"I'll be here if you need me."
LAURA: Okay.

00:51:00.601 --> 00:51:03.611
As I start to run away, I stop and turn around at the door

00:51:03.611 --> 00:51:05.352
and say:

00:51:05.352 --> 00:51:09.318
Have you heard anything else from Lord Sharpe?

00:51:09.318 --> 00:51:14.243
Have you heard anything else from Lord Sharpe?

00:51:15.671 --> 00:51:18.838
MATT: "Not at the moment, but he has...

00:51:19.908 --> 00:51:22.236
"He hasn't been a client for a bit of time."

00:51:22.236 --> 00:51:25.369
LAURA: Not anything since the party?

00:51:25.369 --> 00:51:26.953
MATT: "No."

00:51:26.953 --> 00:51:28.561
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: "Why?"

00:51:28.561 --> 00:51:30.970
LAURA: I was just wondering.

00:51:30.970 --> 00:51:32.505
I was just wondering.

00:51:32.505 --> 00:51:33.870
MATT: "Okay."

00:51:33.870 --> 00:51:35.202
LAURA: I love you!

00:51:35.202 --> 00:51:36.910
MATT: "I love you too, Jester."

00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:38.382
LAURA: And I ran down the stairs.

00:51:38.382 --> 00:51:39.215
MATT: Okay.

00:51:41.070 --> 00:51:45.460
So, as you all gathered at the bottom of the Lavish Chateau,

00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:46.788
where are you off to?

00:51:46.788 --> 00:51:48.525
LAURA: I tell her exactly, I'll tell everybody

00:51:48.525 --> 00:51:52.288
where Veth lives. Should we head off there immediately?

00:51:52.288 --> 00:51:54.924
LIAM: We need our ninth member.

00:51:54.924 --> 00:51:56.641
MARISHA: Let's go.

00:51:56.641 --> 00:51:58.463
Kick down her door.

00:51:58.463 --> 00:52:00.156
Break all of her plates.

00:52:00.156 --> 00:52:01.142
Eat all of her food.

00:52:01.142 --> 00:52:03.194
LIAM: Like friends do.
MARISHA: Drink all of her booze.

00:52:03.194 --> 00:52:05.172
MATT: (chuckling)
MARISHA: It's going to be great.

00:52:05.172 --> 00:52:07.240
MATT: Now Veth, what have you been up to

00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:09.220
since they've been gone?

00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:11.014
SAM: Well, it's only been, like, 10 hours.

00:52:11.014 --> 00:52:12.575
(laughter)

00:52:12.575 --> 00:52:15.303
MATT: Yeah.
SAM: So not a whole lot?

00:52:15.303 --> 00:52:18.388
We had a day, we walked around, went to the beach,

00:52:18.388 --> 00:52:21.788
went to the farmer's market,

00:52:21.788 --> 00:52:24.526
had a lunch outside.

00:52:24.526 --> 00:52:26.745
We're probably cooking, getting ready for

00:52:26.745 --> 00:52:28.762
a really nice dinner when--

00:52:28.762 --> 00:52:30.007
LAURA: Little dinner.
SAM: Yeah,

00:52:30.007 --> 00:52:32.029
when knock, knock, knock, I guess.

00:52:32.029 --> 00:52:33.151
(laughter)

00:52:33.151 --> 00:52:34.201
TRAVIS: Knock knock. (slamming)

00:52:34.201 --> 00:52:36.626
TALIESIN, MARISHA, ASHLEY: Hey!

00:52:36.626 --> 00:52:38.870
MARISHA: Oh god, it smells so good!

00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:40.234
What are you cooking?

00:52:40.234 --> 00:52:41.867
TRAVIS: Oh, hand me some of that, will you?

00:52:41.867 --> 00:52:42.700
MARISHA: Do you have chairs?
MATT: (as Yeza) "Should I--"

00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:43.784
MARISHA: We could pull up some chairs.

00:52:43.784 --> 00:52:46.000
TALIESIN: I can just--
SAM: We have four chairs.

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:47.548
MATT: "Yeah, I can get some things,

00:52:47.548 --> 00:52:48.642
"I didn't realize were having company."

00:52:48.642 --> 00:52:51.467
SAM: I didn't either, They just left!

00:52:51.467 --> 00:52:53.571
LAURA: We can eat on the floor. It's okay, I don't mind.

00:52:53.571 --> 00:52:55.356
SAM: Oh, no, no, we'll sit on the floor.

00:52:55.356 --> 00:52:57.034
We made sausages and things.

00:52:57.034 --> 00:52:58.197
MARISHA: What a nice balcony!

00:52:58.197 --> 00:52:59.881
I could sleep on the balcony.

00:52:59.881 --> 00:53:00.980
SAM: You're sleeping here?!

00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:02.875
LAURA: No, no, no, we can sleep at the Lavish Chateau.

00:53:02.875 --> 00:53:05.207
There's plenty of rooms there.

00:53:05.207 --> 00:53:06.999
It's fine.
ASHLEY: I put Luc on my shoulders.

00:53:06.999 --> 00:53:08.930
SAM: Oh, that's tall.

00:53:08.930 --> 00:53:10.375
MATT: "I'm going to-- I'll be right back.

00:53:10.375 --> 00:53:12.056
"I'm just going to make a quick trip to just

00:53:12.056 --> 00:53:14.874
"grab a few things that we--"
LAURA: Do you need any help?

00:53:14.874 --> 00:53:18.505
MATT: "I'm fine, I can get to and from pretty quick."

00:53:18.505 --> 00:53:19.916
SAM: Okay, well, hurry back.

00:53:19.916 --> 00:53:22.990
Oh shit, I think I just stepped in dog shit.

00:53:22.990 --> 00:53:26.258
Oh my...
MATT: "(sighs)"

00:53:26.258 --> 00:53:28.276
SAM: Just go, I'll clean it up by
the time you get back here.

00:53:28.276 --> 00:53:29.985
LIAM: Yasha, be careful, the boy's head

00:53:29.985 --> 00:53:31.815
is practically scraping the ceiling.

00:53:31.815 --> 00:53:33.815
LAURA: Yeah, maybe duck a little bit.

00:53:33.815 --> 00:53:35.089
ASHLEY: You okay up there?

00:53:35.089 --> 00:53:36.839
MATT: (as Luc) "Yeah!

00:53:36.839 --> 00:53:38.744
"This is so cool!"

00:53:38.744 --> 00:53:40.173
TALIESIN: Careful of the ceiling fan.

00:53:40.173 --> 00:53:44.464
MATT: He's now doing like, arm flexing, muscles, like...

00:53:44.464 --> 00:53:45.841
ASHLEY: Ooh, so strong!

00:53:45.841 --> 00:53:49.379
(laughter)
ASHLEY: He's a tough boy.

00:53:49.379 --> 00:53:53.175
SAM: Wow, you guys were gone <i>so</i> long.

00:53:53.175 --> 00:53:55.862
(laughter)

00:53:55.862 --> 00:53:57.324
SAM: Do we have a new mission?

00:53:57.324 --> 00:53:58.790
MARISHA: So much has happened.

00:53:58.790 --> 00:54:00.868
LAURA: Oh my gosh, so much.

00:54:00.868 --> 00:54:05.460
SAM: Recap everything that happened in order!

00:54:06.932 --> 00:54:08.329
MARISHA: And we do.

00:54:08.329 --> 00:54:10.743
(laughter)
MATT: Okay.

00:54:10.743 --> 00:54:13.043
LIAM: Thank you.
SAM: Wow!

00:54:13.043 --> 00:54:14.931
What a detailed account!

00:54:14.931 --> 00:54:16.992
MARISHA: Yeah. Bored Fjord.

00:54:16.992 --> 00:54:19.347
SAM: Wow. Anyway, my god.

00:54:19.347 --> 00:54:23.080
So we're going to dinner with the enemy.

00:54:24.022 --> 00:54:25.222
That's crazy.

00:54:25.222 --> 00:54:26.055
TRAVIS: Yes.

00:54:28.017 --> 00:54:30.559
SAM: Tomorrow, did you say? Or two days?

00:54:30.559 --> 00:54:32.647
LIAM: Tomorrow night. We can--
SAM: Tomorrow night.

00:54:32.647 --> 00:54:35.244
LIAM: -- enjoy the evening here.

00:54:35.244 --> 00:54:37.207
SAM: Yes, yes, yes.

00:54:37.207 --> 00:54:39.518
And then tomorrow, are there preparations

00:54:39.518 --> 00:54:42.061
that we need to make, like, you know,

00:54:42.061 --> 00:54:46.210
like a code word or anything, or should we bring

00:54:46.210 --> 00:54:49.500
a bomb in case things go awry, or?

00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:51.438
LAURA: Ooh, good call.

00:54:51.438 --> 00:54:52.644
TALIESIN: Really?

00:54:52.644 --> 00:54:53.879
TRAVIS: You have a bomb just sitting?

00:54:53.879 --> 00:54:55.572
LAURA: Yeah, a bomb's always smart--
SAM: I have a bomb, yes.

00:54:55.572 --> 00:54:57.871
LAURA: -- to have, you know, around, just in case.

00:54:57.871 --> 00:55:00.780
SAM: Or we've got Yeza here.

00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:03.744
I could make some sort of, I can have him make

00:55:03.744 --> 00:55:06.342
some sort of alchemical thing that we, like,

00:55:06.342 --> 00:55:10.846
just sprinkle into Ikithon's drink.
LAURA: It makes him shit all over himself!

00:55:10.846 --> 00:55:14.518
SAM: Yeah, I was thinking kill him, but you know.

00:55:14.518 --> 00:55:16.525
Or he can just shit all over himself.
TRAVIS: Shit himself is good, too.

00:55:16.525 --> 00:55:18.767
LAURA: Can you imagine how embarrassing it would be, though,

00:55:18.767 --> 00:55:21.018
if he just shit all over himself at the table

00:55:21.018 --> 00:55:22.590
in his own house?

00:55:22.590 --> 00:55:24.222
SAM: That'd be pretty good.

00:55:24.222 --> 00:55:27.179
LIAM: I think our chances of murdering Trent Ikithon

00:55:27.179 --> 00:55:30.238
in his home are slim to none.

00:55:32.699 --> 00:55:34.848
TRAVIS: Good to know, good to know.

00:55:34.848 --> 00:55:39.290
LAURA: What if we lure him out onto a balcony or something?

00:55:39.290 --> 00:55:41.179
LIAM: What if we go to dinner--

00:55:41.179 --> 00:55:42.459
SAM: And eat it?

00:55:42.459 --> 00:55:45.129
LIAM: Eat it, after Beauregard eats it.

00:55:45.129 --> 00:55:46.459
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:55:46.459 --> 00:55:47.952
LIAM: Give it to Beauregard. She'll try anything.

00:55:47.952 --> 00:55:49.626
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. (laughs)

00:55:50.633 --> 00:55:53.341
LIAM: And let's see what we see.

00:55:54.601 --> 00:55:55.621
MARISHA: But I guess just to be clear,

00:55:55.621 --> 00:55:59.640
if there does happen to be a chance where we can murder him,

00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:01.149
should we?

00:56:01.149 --> 00:56:02.751
Or should we just like, table that?

00:56:02.751 --> 00:56:04.653
TRAVIS: I think we're following his lead.

00:56:04.653 --> 00:56:06.602
Caleb's lead, yeah?
MARISHA: Okay.

00:56:06.602 --> 00:56:08.311
TALIESIN: No sudden moves.
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:56:08.311 --> 00:56:11.748
SAM: And this trip northward to the frigid country,

00:56:11.748 --> 00:56:15.754
is that immediately after dinner, or days later?

00:56:15.754 --> 00:56:17.322
LAURA: It's like a week from now.
LIAM: End of the week.

00:56:17.322 --> 00:56:20.642
SAM: So we don't need to be prepared for like a quick,

00:56:20.642 --> 00:56:22.863
"Thanks for dinner, Trent. Let's get the fuck outta here."

00:56:22.863 --> 00:56:24.692
We don't to do that or anything, right?

00:56:24.692 --> 00:56:26.311
TALIESIN: Only if dinner goes really poorly.

00:56:26.311 --> 00:56:29.371
LAURA: Only if we stay at Trent's place for a week.

00:56:29.371 --> 00:56:31.563
We should get some winter clothes together, you guys.

00:56:31.563 --> 00:56:32.588
MARISHA: Yeah, we should.
TALIESIN: I have nothing.

00:56:32.588 --> 00:56:34.588
LAURA: It's going to be so cold.

00:56:36.628 --> 00:56:38.249
SAM: Okay.
LIAM: Top of the world, yeah.

00:56:39.674 --> 00:56:41.982
SAM: Is there shopping here?

00:56:42.999 --> 00:56:44.457
LAURA: I mean, yeah, but...

00:56:44.457 --> 00:56:45.898
SAM: But not winter shopping.

00:56:45.898 --> 00:56:46.967
LIAM: No, I think Rexxentrum is better.

00:56:46.967 --> 00:56:48.567
LAURA: We can have anything custom made, yeah,

00:56:48.567 --> 00:56:50.315
but it's colder there.
LIAM: Yeah. Yeah.

00:56:50.315 --> 00:56:51.645
TALIESIN: A little better.
SAM: Okay.

00:56:51.645 --> 00:56:52.836
MATT: (creaking door)

00:56:52.836 --> 00:56:54.519
(as Yeza) "All right, so I think
I've got enough for everybody."

00:56:54.519 --> 00:56:55.854
TRAVIS: Oh, let me take that for you.

00:56:55.854 --> 00:56:57.008
Let me help you.

00:56:57.008 --> 00:56:58.853
LAURA: He's like a Santa Claus!
MARISHA: Oh, you got a six pack!

00:56:58.853 --> 00:57:00.027
Awesome!

00:57:01.230 --> 00:57:03.063
SAM: Caduceus, can you help cook a little bit?

00:57:03.063 --> 00:57:05.312
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, let me-- let's--
MATT: "Yeah, yeah, come."

00:57:05.312 --> 00:57:08.244
TALIESIN: Oh, it's really tiny in
here. How do you do-- oh wow.

00:57:08.244 --> 00:57:09.996
LIAM: Oh, wow.
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:57:09.996 --> 00:57:11.429
LAURA: Oh.
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah.

00:57:11.429 --> 00:57:14.198
LAURA: Maybe just get down on your knees, Caduceus.

00:57:14.198 --> 00:57:15.486
TALIESIN: I'm going to just sit.

00:57:15.486 --> 00:57:17.359
I'm just not even-- I'm just going to sit down.

00:57:17.359 --> 00:57:18.731
MATT: "I'll get a stool for you, just--"

00:57:18.731 --> 00:57:20.985
TALIESIN: Oh no, the floor is fine. This is really low.

00:57:20.985 --> 00:57:23.121
MATT: "Okay, no worries. Just help me cut these up

00:57:23.121 --> 00:57:24.938
"and I'll go ahead and get it sautÃ©ing, and I've got it.

00:57:24.938 --> 00:57:26.511
"You guys continue, sorry."

00:57:26.784 --> 00:57:29.117
SAM: We rented the halfling apartment,

00:57:29.117 --> 00:57:30.637
but we should have rented a full size one.

00:57:30.637 --> 00:57:32.037
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)

00:57:32.037 --> 00:57:33.478
TALIESIN: The rent different is--

00:57:33.478 --> 00:57:35.103
SAM: You know what? Here.

00:57:35.103 --> 00:57:39.370
Yeza, take 500 gold and just get us another place

00:57:39.370 --> 00:57:42.107
nearby in case this happens again.

00:57:42.107 --> 00:57:43.363
MATT: "Where are you getting all this money?"

00:57:43.363 --> 00:57:47.289
SAM: Oh, it's crazy. We find money all over the place.

00:57:47.289 --> 00:57:49.578
(laughter)

00:57:49.578 --> 00:57:52.774
SAM: This one, this bunch we found in a volcano!

00:57:52.774 --> 00:57:53.724
LAURA: It's true.

00:57:53.724 --> 00:57:55.577
MATT: "So you weren't joking.
You actually were in a volcano?"

00:57:55.577 --> 00:57:56.476
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:57:56.476 --> 00:57:58.260
That wasn't a metaphorical volcano.

00:57:58.260 --> 00:58:00.327
That was a real volcano.

00:58:00.327 --> 00:58:01.924
MATT: "I thought you were just on, like,

00:58:01.924 --> 00:58:04.259
"an emotional journey with your friends."

00:58:04.259 --> 00:58:06.397
SAM: I mean, it was also cathartic for many other reasons,

00:58:06.397 --> 00:58:09.027
but no, no, this was a literal volcano.

00:58:09.027 --> 00:58:10.717
MATT: "So this tentacled, multi-eyed beast

00:58:10.717 --> 00:58:13.844
"wasn't some sort of projection of your internal--"

00:58:13.844 --> 00:58:16.247
SAM: It wasn't fear of commitment.
MATT: "Actual?"

00:58:16.247 --> 00:58:17.889
SAM: No, it was real, yeah.

00:58:17.889 --> 00:58:19.577
MATT: "That is terrifying."

00:58:19.577 --> 00:58:21.630
Luc's like, "It's so cool!"

00:58:21.630 --> 00:58:23.238
LAURA: It was really cool.
LIAM: It's a hard story to tell

00:58:23.238 --> 00:58:25.071
with Luc around, to be honest.

00:58:25.927 --> 00:58:27.167
MARISHA: It's what? It's a bad story to tell?

00:58:27.167 --> 00:58:29.097
LIAM: It's a hard story to tell,

00:58:29.097 --> 00:58:31.657
as many of the details are maybe not for--

00:58:31.657 --> 00:58:34.508
MARISHA: No, it's the best story to tell with him around.
LAURA: It was a giant, black--

00:58:34.508 --> 00:58:36.710
LIAM: Maybe a couple more years.
LAURA: -- multi-tentacled monster--

00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:38.140
MARISHA: He's going to find out sooner or later, man.
SAM: We'll just skip a couple of--

00:58:38.140 --> 00:58:41.637
LAURA: -- fire coming out of his skin and he breathed fire

00:58:41.637 --> 00:58:44.157
and he had multiple eyes and he sent you these

00:58:44.157 --> 00:58:48.497
mental images of this really scary place.

00:58:48.497 --> 00:58:50.067
MATT: "And did you kill him, Mom?"

00:58:50.067 --> 00:58:51.417
SAM: (scoffs) Duh.

00:58:52.406 --> 00:58:53.266
MATT: "Yes!"

00:58:53.266 --> 00:58:54.407
LAURA: Your mom had the final blow.

00:58:54.407 --> 00:58:56.005
She took him down with one shot.

00:58:56.005 --> 00:58:57.595
LIAM: Murdered him straight up.

00:58:57.595 --> 00:58:58.753
SAM: Did I?

00:58:58.753 --> 00:59:02.136
MATT: Yeza's over in the corner, like, (tapping)

00:59:02.136 --> 00:59:04.847
TRAVIS: Finger, finger, finger.
MATT: "Okay! Okay.

00:59:06.197 --> 00:59:08.670
"I mean that's greatly impressive. Be careful."

00:59:08.670 --> 00:59:10.187
SAM: Of course, of course. Always careful.

00:59:10.187 --> 00:59:12.651
Safety first, right? That's The Mighty Nein motto.

00:59:12.651 --> 00:59:15.727
LAURA: And then we were throwing penises into a volcano,

00:59:15.727 --> 00:59:18.020
in the same volcano, and this god came down.

00:59:18.020 --> 00:59:20.067
SAM: Don't worry. They weren't real penises.

00:59:20.067 --> 00:59:21.663
We made them first.

00:59:21.663 --> 00:59:23.297
MARISHA: They were real penises.
SAM: They were toy penises.

00:59:23.297 --> 00:59:24.997
LAURA: Here!
MATT: "Dad, what's a penis?"

00:59:24.997 --> 00:59:27.812
And Yeza's like, (groans)
LIAM: Oh no!

00:59:28.777 --> 00:59:30.507
TRAVIS: There was a gold one, but it got stuck

00:59:30.507 --> 00:59:32.950
in this woman's hand. It was incredible.

00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:34.693
MATT: (as Luc) "What?!"
TRAVIS: For-ev-er.

00:59:34.693 --> 00:59:38.288
MATT: Yeza's like, "Oh, ah-- honey?"

00:59:39.367 --> 00:59:42.137
SAM: Sorry, we'll tone it down a little bit.

00:59:42.137 --> 00:59:43.871
TALIESIN: Going to be the best archenemy.
LAURA: Yeah.

00:59:43.871 --> 00:59:46.094
SAM: But--
MARISHA: Hey, Luc. Luc!

00:59:46.094 --> 00:59:46.927
MATT: (whispering) "What?"

00:59:46.927 --> 00:59:48.397
MARISHA: You want to learn our secret handshake, though,

00:59:48.397 --> 00:59:49.707
from the island?
MATT: "Yeah!"

00:59:49.707 --> 00:59:52.392
MARISHA: Just go: Chaos reign!
MATT: "Chaos reign!"

00:59:52.392 --> 00:59:54.043
Yeza's like, "No no no!"

00:59:54.043 --> 00:59:56.271
MARISHA: You got it, yeah!

00:59:56.271 --> 00:59:58.817
SAM: Here, here, here. Give him a fucking firework,

00:59:58.817 --> 01:00:00.397
take his mind off.
ASHLEY: Wait, here, here, here.

01:00:00.397 --> 01:00:02.687
MARISHA: Yeah, let's shoot some
fireworks off from the balcony.

01:00:02.687 --> 01:00:04.088
MATT: "I want a fucking firework!"

01:00:04.088 --> 01:00:05.777
MARISHA: Yeah!

01:00:05.777 --> 01:00:07.917
TRAVIS: We have any more T-Rex? Did anyone bring home

01:00:07.917 --> 01:00:09.767
T-Rex in a pouch or something?

01:00:09.767 --> 01:00:10.987
TALIESIN: I've got some teeth.
ASHLEY: A T-Rex tooth?

01:00:10.987 --> 01:00:12.557
LAURA: Yeah! We all have a tooth!

01:00:12.557 --> 01:00:15.277
MATT: "Hey, Luc, why don't you go play with

01:00:15.277 --> 01:00:18.787
"your friend Vanishing Dog, whatever his name is."

01:00:18.787 --> 01:00:20.895
LAURA: Nugget, his name is Nugget.
MATT: "Nugget.

01:00:20.895 --> 01:00:22.197
"That's the one."

01:00:22.197 --> 01:00:24.950
MARISHA: I slip Luc some bottle rockets.

01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:26.200
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check.

01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:28.597
MARISHA: Okay.
TRAVIS: He's going to burn the house down.

01:00:28.597 --> 01:00:31.687
LAURA: Oh my god. Please don't bust his hand off.

01:00:31.687 --> 01:00:33.287
LIAM: Does your house have a yard?
LAURA: If he does, though,

01:00:33.287 --> 01:00:35.203
I'll be able to fix it. Don't worry.
LIAM: No?

01:00:35.203 --> 01:00:36.387
MARISHA: 11.

01:00:36.387 --> 01:00:38.669
SAM: There must be a courtyard. It's a condo.

01:00:38.669 --> 01:00:39.810
MATT: So Yeza sees it.

01:00:39.810 --> 01:00:40.926
TALIESIN: Those Malibu houses.

01:00:40.926 --> 01:00:43.051
SAM: Taliesin, can you tell me,

01:00:43.051 --> 01:00:44.913
what was it like to grow up as Luc?

01:00:44.913 --> 01:00:46.999
(laughter)

01:00:46.999 --> 01:00:50.624
MATT: Yeza walks over and takes the rockets from Luc.

01:00:50.624 --> 01:00:52.457
LAURA and MARISHA: Aww.

01:00:52.457 --> 01:00:54.302
MATT: "When he's old enough."

01:00:54.302 --> 01:00:55.997
LAURA: How old is he? How old is Luc?

01:00:57.137 --> 01:00:57.970
SAM: DM?

01:00:57.970 --> 01:00:59.396
(laughter)

01:00:59.396 --> 01:01:02.026
SAM: At the beginning I felt he was around three or four.

01:01:02.026 --> 01:01:03.487
Now I feel like he's like six or seven.

01:01:03.487 --> 01:01:04.917
MATT: No, he's like four.

01:01:04.917 --> 01:01:06.373
SAM: He's four?!
LAURA: He's four?!

01:01:06.373 --> 01:01:07.681
SAM: Oh my god! But you know,

01:01:07.681 --> 01:01:09.646
halflings are different.
LAURA: I thought he was six or seven!

01:01:09.646 --> 01:01:12.123
SAM: Halflings are different, right?
LIAM: Yeah, they're much older.

01:01:14.122 --> 01:01:15.924
LAURA: He's that little?
MATT: Yeah.

01:01:15.924 --> 01:01:17.588
LAURA: Oh, now I feel really bad.

01:01:17.588 --> 01:01:19.257
TRAVIS: You gave a four-year-old bottle rockets.

01:01:19.257 --> 01:01:21.774
MATT: Yeah.
LAURA: You gave a four-year-old a crossbow!

01:01:21.774 --> 01:01:23.227
MARISHA: Perfectly safe toy.

01:01:24.125 --> 01:01:27.247
ASHLEY: Also, your four-year-old
should know what his penis is.

01:01:27.247 --> 01:01:29.024
LAURA: Yeah, a four-year-old should definitely know.

01:01:29.024 --> 01:01:30.290
SAM: We call it a wee-wee.

01:01:30.290 --> 01:01:32.452
LAURA: Oh.
ASHLEY: A wee-wee.

01:01:32.452 --> 01:01:33.827
MATT: The term he was unfamiliar with.

01:01:33.827 --> 01:01:34.897
SAM: Yeah.
LAURA: Got it.

01:01:34.897 --> 01:01:37.147
SAM: We don't use medical terms around him.

01:01:37.147 --> 01:01:39.567
LAURA: You know, my mom believed in medical terms.

01:01:39.567 --> 01:01:40.840
Just put it right out there.

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:41.681
SAM: Really?
LAURA: Yeah.

01:01:41.681 --> 01:01:43.897
That way you never, you know, get confused.

01:01:43.897 --> 01:01:45.303
TRAVIS: Put the penis right out there?

01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:47.053
LAURA: Just the word.

01:01:47.053 --> 01:01:48.251
MATT: "Dinner's ready!"

01:01:48.251 --> 01:01:51.917
(laughter)

01:01:52.794 --> 01:01:53.693
MATT: All right.

01:01:53.693 --> 01:01:55.336
LAURA: (laughing) Three or four?!

01:01:55.336 --> 01:01:58.320
SAM: Well, I was confused!

01:01:59.347 --> 01:02:01.122
He acts-- he's very precocious.

01:02:01.122 --> 01:02:03.130
He reads at a sixth grade--

01:02:03.130 --> 01:02:04.530
a six-year-old level, I mean.

01:02:04.530 --> 01:02:05.546
LAURA: Oh yeah, well.

01:02:05.546 --> 01:02:09.148
TRAVIS: Sixth grade level? Holy shit, he's brilliant.

01:02:09.148 --> 01:02:11.481
(laughter)

01:02:14.579 --> 01:02:16.097
MATT: So.

01:02:16.097 --> 01:02:19.267
You enjoy a fine meal, cooked by the team of

01:02:19.267 --> 01:02:21.130
Yeza and Caduceus.

01:02:21.967 --> 01:02:24.087
Catch up a bit more on the stories about

01:02:24.087 --> 01:02:27.680
your all perspectives on the experience, Rumblecusp.

01:02:28.677 --> 01:02:30.327
And you're able to speak on whatever,

01:02:30.327 --> 01:02:33.817
as much as you'd like to about your future plans, if at all.

01:02:33.817 --> 01:02:38.437
But nevertheless evening grows dark, the sun sets.

01:02:38.437 --> 01:02:40.917
Is there anything you wish to accomplish for the night

01:02:40.917 --> 01:02:42.618
here in Nicodranas?

01:02:42.618 --> 01:02:45.157
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a walk to the lighthouse.

01:02:45.157 --> 01:02:46.140
LAURA: Oh.

01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:48.223
MATT: Okay. All right.

01:02:49.890 --> 01:02:53.157
After the meal is done, and it is a nice filling meal,

01:02:53.157 --> 01:02:55.117
some of you rest to digest for a bit

01:02:55.117 --> 01:02:58.997
and, you know, watch Luc begin to act out

01:02:58.997 --> 01:03:02.964
his interpretations of the things that his mother did.

01:03:02.964 --> 01:03:05.097
He starts taking his--

01:03:05.097 --> 01:03:08.448
still slightly dangerous for a child his age, crossbow--

01:03:08.448 --> 01:03:10.897
(laughter)

01:03:10.897 --> 01:03:12.377
ASHLEY: Four-year-old.
SAM: Got to learn some time.

01:03:12.377 --> 01:03:13.507
MATT: Yep.

01:03:13.507 --> 01:03:15.267
While Caduceus, you make your way out

01:03:15.267 --> 01:03:18.857
along the sand-scraped cobblestones

01:03:18.857 --> 01:03:20.823
of the Opal Archways,

01:03:20.823 --> 01:03:24.306
passing down towards the harbor.

01:03:25.427 --> 01:03:28.679
Drawn towards the image of the large

01:03:28.679 --> 01:03:32.207
lighthouse of the Wild Mother.

01:03:32.207 --> 01:03:36.697
You can see the gradual shifting of the beam across the

01:03:36.697 --> 01:03:38.887
cloudless starry night sky.

01:03:38.887 --> 01:03:42.477
You can hear the sound of waves crashing against the

01:03:43.377 --> 01:03:44.950
rocks and beach.

01:03:45.817 --> 01:03:49.117
You can hear the occasional whistles and bells from ships

01:03:49.117 --> 01:03:51.617
that are coming into and going back out to harbor.

01:03:56.609 --> 01:03:57.867
TALIESIN: This is perfect.

01:04:00.157 --> 01:04:01.807
I'm going to cast Word of Recall.

01:04:03.317 --> 01:04:04.337
MATT: Okay.

01:04:04.337 --> 01:04:05.645
SAM: (whispering) What does that do?

01:04:06.843 --> 01:04:08.947
I guess it recalls something?

01:04:08.947 --> 01:04:10.657
LIAM: Didn't you see Total Recall?

01:04:10.657 --> 01:04:12.197
TALIESIN: Total Recall.

01:04:12.197 --> 01:04:13.351
SAM: Word of Total Recall.

01:04:13.351 --> 01:04:14.184
LAURA: Wait.

01:04:15.182 --> 01:04:17.387
TALIESIN: You have to do it in a--

01:04:17.387 --> 01:04:19.137
You get the little temple, I don't.

01:04:20.447 --> 01:04:23.734
MATT: All right. So.
SAM: Are you leaving the party?

01:04:23.734 --> 01:04:25.497
MATT: Explain how you cast the spell.

01:04:29.227 --> 01:04:30.385
TALIESIN: Take in the lighthouse,

01:04:30.385 --> 01:04:34.397
and I reach into my bag for

01:04:34.397 --> 01:04:38.817
some of the mushrooms and fruit and dirt

01:04:38.817 --> 01:04:43.039
that I keep from home that my tea comes from,

01:04:43.039 --> 01:04:47.838
and I just slowly drop it

01:04:47.838 --> 01:04:49.179
at the edge of the lighthouse

01:04:49.179 --> 01:04:51.397
as I walk around it as much as I can.

01:04:51.397 --> 01:04:56.397
And let it start to take root.

01:04:57.047 --> 01:04:59.347
and use the Decompose to just let it

01:05:00.257 --> 01:05:05.257
begin to grow at its accelerated rate.

01:05:05.277 --> 01:05:06.381
MATT: Okay.

01:05:06.381 --> 01:05:08.067
TALIESIN: Connect it to my temple.

01:05:08.067 --> 01:05:12.227
MATT: Okay. As you finish your pass around,

01:05:12.227 --> 01:05:16.027
which the lighthouse is on the edge of the cliff.

01:05:16.027 --> 01:05:18.887
So there are a few precarious edges that you toss

01:05:18.887 --> 01:05:20.927
and let the wind do the rest for you.

01:05:20.927 --> 01:05:23.637
And as you do, you toss a bit of

01:05:23.637 --> 01:05:27.127
this mulch, if you will, into the wind

01:05:27.127 --> 01:05:29.037
and watch as a breeze

01:05:29.037 --> 01:05:30.447
blows it back in to the lighthouse,

01:05:30.447 --> 01:05:33.207
and it slides down into the bits of cliff edge,

01:05:33.207 --> 01:05:35.457
dirt, sea grass that are

01:05:36.687 --> 01:05:38.440
barely cusping off the edge.

01:05:39.467 --> 01:05:42.427
And as you return back to the point

01:05:42.427 --> 01:05:44.887
where you had begun this, you can already see

01:05:46.007 --> 01:05:49.650
small peaking caps beginning to make their way through.

01:05:50.567 --> 01:05:55.337
As you finish concentrating, close your eyes, taking a deep

01:05:55.337 --> 01:05:58.167
breath and muttering your prayer to the Wild Mother,

01:05:58.167 --> 01:06:02.647
with your eyes closed, the lightless expanse around you.

01:06:02.647 --> 01:06:07.027
Through your eyelids, you see a faint, warm

01:06:07.027 --> 01:06:11.240
pale white-green glow in the shape of the lighthouse itself,

01:06:12.387 --> 01:06:14.580
pierce into your mind's eye.

01:06:15.767 --> 01:06:17.197
And as you slowly open your eyes,

01:06:17.197 --> 01:06:20.877
that glow remains hanging for but a second longer.

01:06:20.877 --> 01:06:24.557
It's like the lighthouse itself

01:06:24.557 --> 01:06:26.447
is emitting light as a central beacon,

01:06:26.447 --> 01:06:29.135
as opposed to the actual beam.

01:06:29.135 --> 01:06:31.177
As that fades, you look down

01:06:31.177 --> 01:06:32.807
and the mushrooms are now fully grown

01:06:33.757 --> 01:06:36.827
as if weeks had passed in a matter of moments.

01:06:36.827 --> 01:06:40.077
And you feel a a deep, anchored

01:06:40.077 --> 01:06:42.030
connection to this lighthouse.

01:06:45.157 --> 01:06:48.044
TALIESIN: With a little luck, we won't need this, but...

01:06:51.634 --> 01:06:54.517
we'll try to deal with what you've put in front of us.

01:06:56.437 --> 01:06:57.270
Thank you.

01:06:58.559 --> 01:07:03.067
I'll take the slow walk back to the Chateau, so.

01:07:03.067 --> 01:07:04.697
MATT: Okay.

01:07:04.697 --> 01:07:07.640
LAURA: I'm going to walk back to the Lavish Chateau.

01:07:09.337 --> 01:07:12.687
Actually, are we all going back there to sleep tonight?

01:07:12.687 --> 01:07:14.190
LIAM: You said you were putting us up there, yeah.

01:07:14.190 --> 01:07:16.927
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay. I'll
do this when we get back, then.

01:07:16.927 --> 01:07:20.127
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: But I will step away for a moment

01:07:20.127 --> 01:07:23.837
and I'm going to just-- is there a balcony here?

01:07:23.837 --> 01:07:26.842
Is there somewhere where I can be a little private?

01:07:26.842 --> 01:07:27.675
Veth?

01:07:27.675 --> 01:07:29.417
SAM: Oh yeah, sure. There's a little courtyard

01:07:29.417 --> 01:07:32.197
and there's a roof, there's a rooftop deck.

01:07:32.197 --> 01:07:34.467
LAURA: Really?
SAM: Well, it came with the HOA.

01:07:34.467 --> 01:07:36.997
LAURA: Wow. I'm going to go up to the rooftop deck.

01:07:36.997 --> 01:07:39.355
MATT: Okay. (giggles)

01:07:39.355 --> 01:07:42.397
LAURA: I'm going to sit down and I'm going to cast Scry

01:07:43.627 --> 01:07:46.570
on Lord Robert Sharpe.

01:07:47.787 --> 01:07:50.420
MATT: All right.
LAURA: And see what the fuck he's doing.

01:07:52.617 --> 01:07:56.577
MATT: Okay. You sit there for a second.

01:07:56.577 --> 01:07:57.987
Looking over, from this perspective,

01:07:57.987 --> 01:08:00.077
it's a beautiful view of the Archways

01:08:00.077 --> 01:08:02.027
of the buildings of similar height.

01:08:02.027 --> 01:08:04.707
And you can see, because the Archways exists

01:08:04.707 --> 01:08:06.437
a little bit on a higher hill than a lot of

01:08:06.437 --> 01:08:08.277
the rest of the city, which descends around

01:08:08.277 --> 01:08:10.277
before it gets to the edge of the cliff side.

01:08:10.277 --> 01:08:14.399
So from this rooftop view at night, it's this beautiful

01:08:14.399 --> 01:08:17.537
landscape of hundreds and hundreds of lantern lights,

01:08:17.537 --> 01:08:21.120
different colors, of different colored glass, and lanterns.

01:08:22.357 --> 01:08:23.677
So it's this beautiful view.

01:08:23.677 --> 01:08:27.617
And as you sit, the still somewhat warm

01:08:27.617 --> 01:08:32.447
ocean air coming in, close your eyes and concentrate.

01:08:32.447 --> 01:08:37.447
In that moment, you sense
across from you, hands taking yours

01:08:37.517 --> 01:08:39.450
and a voice, a familiar voice goes,

01:08:40.622 --> 01:08:44.414
"So you want to go peek in on that disgusting being."

01:08:44.414 --> 01:08:47.967
LAURA: I just want to make sure that, you know,

01:08:47.967 --> 01:08:49.086
I'm not going to get in trouble for

01:08:49.086 --> 01:08:51.231
what we pulled at the party.

01:08:51.231 --> 01:08:52.434
MATT: "Let's go have a look, shall we?"

01:08:52.434 --> 01:08:53.932
LAURA: Okay!

01:08:53.932 --> 01:08:57.357
MATT: As you close your eyes, you feel your

01:08:57.357 --> 01:09:00.627
consciousness extend a bit, like

01:09:00.627 --> 01:09:02.807
the Traveler is taking your hand and pulling

01:09:02.807 --> 01:09:05.217
your spirit from your body for about a moment.

01:09:05.217 --> 01:09:09.557
In that passage, you bring yourself immediately to

01:09:09.557 --> 01:09:13.107
the exterior of a beautiful mansion, this estate

01:09:13.107 --> 01:09:17.507
that exists on the northeastern side of Nicodranas.

01:09:17.507 --> 01:09:22.177
And there, suddenly, you see him sitting in some sort of a

01:09:22.177 --> 01:09:24.747
dark red leather study, books everywhere.

01:09:24.747 --> 01:09:29.607
He's in a long loose silk robe over just some

01:09:29.607 --> 01:09:31.907
comfortable, expensive clothing.

01:09:31.907 --> 01:09:34.827
And it looks like he's in the process of reading

01:09:34.827 --> 01:09:36.902
just casually.

01:09:36.902 --> 01:09:38.887
LAURA: What is he reading? Can I see?

01:09:38.887 --> 01:09:40.187
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:09:44.497 --> 01:09:47.019
TRAVIS: Oh, which one will it be?

01:09:47.019 --> 01:09:50.017
SAM: Got to pick a good one.

01:09:50.017 --> 01:09:50.957
LAURA: 13.

01:09:50.957 --> 01:09:53.807
MATT: 13? Can't quite make out the details,

01:09:53.807 --> 01:09:56.187
but you can get a good view of him.

01:09:56.187 --> 01:10:01.180
He looks like he hasn't been sleeping well,

01:10:02.227 --> 01:10:04.553
but not much else you really pick up on him.

01:10:04.553 --> 01:10:06.782
LAURA: Is there anybody there with him?

01:10:06.782 --> 01:10:07.927
MATT: Not from what you can tell,

01:10:07.927 --> 01:10:12.500
since the focus of this particular scrying beacon is him.

01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:15.277
You can just make out some of
the colors in the room around him

01:10:15.277 --> 01:10:16.797
and the furniture he's immediately on,

01:10:16.797 --> 01:10:21.267
which is a lounging couch, dark red leather.

01:10:21.267 --> 01:10:22.933
That's about it.
LAURA: Okay.

01:10:22.933 --> 01:10:25.117
MATT: So he's not currently at the moment hunting you down,

01:10:25.117 --> 01:10:26.136
if that's what you were worried about.

01:10:26.136 --> 01:10:29.440
LAURA: No, no, no. You know, just... all right.

01:10:31.157 --> 01:10:33.030
SAM: The book is called, "How to Kill Jester."

01:10:33.030 --> 01:10:34.260
LAURA: I know, right?

01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:35.802
MATT: (laughs)

01:10:35.802 --> 01:10:39.310
TRAVIS: So You Got Caught Out
On The Balcony With Your Wang Out.

01:10:40.337 --> 01:10:41.645
MATT: Second edition.

01:10:41.645 --> 01:10:43.978
(laughter)

01:10:46.707 --> 01:10:50.512
LAURA: Okay. I guess I'll stop scrying then.

01:10:50.512 --> 01:10:54.347
MATT: Mmkay. As you return, the voice of the Traveler

01:10:54.347 --> 01:10:55.597
echoes through your mind.

01:10:56.484 --> 01:10:58.417
"Well. At least we didn't catch him

01:10:58.417 --> 01:11:00.277
"with his wang in his hand."

01:11:00.277 --> 01:11:01.174
LAURA: That would have been better, though.

01:11:01.174 --> 01:11:04.334
MATT: "Mmm... some things even I don't want to see."

01:11:05.697 --> 01:11:07.677
And then as you open your eyes again,

01:11:07.677 --> 01:11:10.837
you briefly think you see the flutter of a cloak,

01:11:10.837 --> 01:11:14.147
but it's just a leaf drifting by in the wind,

01:11:14.147 --> 01:11:15.937
but there's no trees immediately nearby.

01:11:15.937 --> 01:11:18.237
So the source of the leaf is a little strange.

01:11:20.472 --> 01:11:21.472
LAURA: I go back inside.

01:11:21.472 --> 01:11:25.190
MATT: Okay. Any other business before the night is done?

01:11:29.427 --> 01:11:30.267
SAM: Negative.

01:11:30.267 --> 01:11:33.327
LIAM: I think when we all get back to the Chateau,

01:11:33.327 --> 01:11:36.357
and we're laughing and had a good time over dinner

01:11:36.357 --> 01:11:38.570
and it's all winding down, I say: Hey,

01:11:39.827 --> 01:11:43.967
you have talked so much about your time as a child

01:11:43.967 --> 01:11:46.627
with your fey friend here and all the time

01:11:46.627 --> 01:11:47.477
you were trapped in your room.

01:11:47.477 --> 01:11:50.957
Would you show us your room? I'm so curious.

01:11:50.957 --> 01:11:53.157
We've been in this building so many times and I've always

01:11:53.157 --> 01:11:55.930
wondered what your childhood bedroom looked like.

01:11:55.930 --> 01:11:57.842
LAURA: You guys want to see my room?

01:11:57.842 --> 01:11:58.800
MARISHA: I feel like--
TRAVIS: Sure.

01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:01.037
MARISHA: I think I saw it when you dressed me up

01:12:01.037 --> 01:12:05.194
in your dress one time, but I-- it's a sight to behold.

01:12:05.194 --> 01:12:08.487
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, come on up!
I'll go up and show them.

01:12:08.487 --> 01:12:11.927
Good! I needed to go to my room anyway, so this is perfect.

01:12:11.927 --> 01:12:14.077
MATT: Okay. Jester leads you up to the chamber

01:12:14.077 --> 01:12:15.937
where she spent the majority of her life,

01:12:15.937 --> 01:12:18.157
and you may describe it to them as you see fit.

01:12:18.157 --> 01:12:22.077
LAURA: Oh my gosh. Um.

01:12:22.077 --> 01:12:26.397
There's a very, ornate little bed in the room.

01:12:26.397 --> 01:12:28.707
Lots of ruffles. It's like a, you know,

01:12:28.707 --> 01:12:32.430
four-post bed, sort of. There's a canopy, you know.

01:12:34.327 --> 01:12:37.575
There's lots of little trinkets everywhere.

01:12:37.575 --> 01:12:42.407
Little sculptures, some are shitty, some are pretty good.

01:12:42.407 --> 01:12:44.080
Lots of books.

01:12:45.507 --> 01:12:47.197
And all over the walls,

01:12:47.197 --> 01:12:49.877
starting at the bottom with really

01:12:49.877 --> 01:12:53.787
not very good drawings, it just covers up.

01:12:53.787 --> 01:12:56.137
The higher you go, the better the drawings get.

01:12:57.867 --> 01:13:00.692
ASHLEY: As you got taller, you got better.

01:13:00.692 --> 01:13:02.950
LAURA: You know, I think talent comes with height.

01:13:04.287 --> 01:13:07.607
ASHLEY: Probably. I must be extremely talented then.

01:13:07.607 --> 01:13:09.099
LAURA: You are, Yasha.

01:13:09.099 --> 01:13:10.647
LIAM: You're a big reader?

01:13:10.647 --> 01:13:12.697
LAURA: Oh, well, yeah. What else are
you going to do when you're,

01:13:12.697 --> 01:13:15.220
you know, hanging out in here?

01:13:16.387 --> 01:13:18.767
Plus, I had a lot of tutors, you know.

01:13:18.767 --> 01:13:22.557
My mom always said it's very important to be educated.

01:13:22.557 --> 01:13:25.457
So you can be a good conversationalist.

01:13:25.457 --> 01:13:27.467
LIAM: Wise woman.
LAURA: Yes.

01:13:27.467 --> 01:13:29.927
TRAVIS: There are a lot of windows in this room.

01:13:29.927 --> 01:13:32.747
LAURA: Yeah. It's fun to look out. Isn't it?

01:13:32.747 --> 01:13:35.437
LIAM: How many times have you climbed out that window?

01:13:35.437 --> 01:13:37.387
LAURA: (giggles) Um...

01:13:38.947 --> 01:13:42.837
Quite a few. But I was actually pretty good about

01:13:42.837 --> 01:13:44.497
staying in for a very long time.

01:13:44.497 --> 01:13:46.267
It wasn't until after the Traveler, really,

01:13:46.267 --> 01:13:50.130
that I started sneaking out a little bit more.

01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:55.581
What do you think?

01:13:55.581 --> 01:13:57.890
LIAM: Better than I imagined, you were not lying.

01:14:00.497 --> 01:14:02.580
LAURA: Oh, oh, oh! Lay down on the bed!

01:14:04.219 --> 01:14:05.513
It's okay. It's okay. Just lay down.

01:14:05.513 --> 01:14:07.144
TRAVIS: Just lay down in the bed, Caleb.

01:14:07.144 --> 01:14:10.427
LIAM: I... it's a little small for me, but okay.

01:14:10.427 --> 01:14:13.597
LAURA: If you lay down in the bed, up on top of the canopy,

01:14:13.597 --> 01:14:17.227
I've painted the beautiful landscape of the Nicodranas

01:14:17.227 --> 01:14:20.087
sea line with the lighthouse and everything

01:14:20.087 --> 01:14:22.497
so you can see it looking out.

01:14:22.497 --> 01:14:25.257
It's like you're looking out the window,

01:14:25.257 --> 01:14:26.808
but it's above you!

01:14:27.971 --> 01:14:30.138
MATT: (tapping)

01:14:31.055 --> 01:14:32.597
(panting)

01:14:32.597 --> 01:14:35.649
You watch as Nugget leaps up onto
the bed as well and is like

01:14:35.649 --> 01:14:37.644
(panting)

01:14:37.644 --> 01:14:40.807
LIAM: I'm really more of a cat person, but okay.

01:14:40.807 --> 01:14:43.054
MATT: And just pees in the bed.

01:14:43.054 --> 01:14:44.979
LAURA: No, Nugget!

01:14:44.979 --> 01:14:47.137
LIAM: Now <i>this</i> I am familiar with.

01:14:47.137 --> 01:14:50.387
LAURA: Nugget, get down. Oh, what is happening?

01:14:50.387 --> 01:14:54.157
You really should learn, Nugget. Don't pee in the bed.

01:14:54.157 --> 01:14:56.302
MATT: Is just gone.

01:14:56.302 --> 01:14:58.972
LIAM: Smells like old times.

01:14:58.972 --> 01:15:00.347
LAURA: I was going to sleep here tonight,

01:15:00.347 --> 01:15:01.767
now I can't sleep in this bed.

01:15:01.767 --> 01:15:03.767
MARISHA: We can help you change the sheets real quick.

01:15:03.767 --> 01:15:07.550
LAURA: Ugh, it's probably gone through to the mattress.

01:15:08.507 --> 01:15:10.107
I'm going to have to buy a new mattress.

01:15:10.107 --> 01:15:13.077
MARISHA: Caduceus, magic it away.
TALIESIN: How?

01:15:13.077 --> 01:15:13.950
MARISHA: I don't know.

01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:16.688
TRAVIS: Eldritch Blast.

01:15:16.688 --> 01:15:17.809
(laughter)

01:15:17.809 --> 01:15:21.597
MATT and LIAM: (explosion)

01:15:21.597 --> 01:15:23.197
LIAM: Blackened feathers everywhere.

01:15:24.217 --> 01:15:28.380
TALIESIN: I wave my hands and the windows
all suddenly snap closed.

01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:30.497
(crashing)

01:15:30.497 --> 01:15:32.643
MARISHA: Okay. Yeah, that works.

01:15:32.643 --> 01:15:34.228
TALIESIN: I don't know what else to tell you.

01:15:34.228 --> 01:15:35.947
LAURA: Keep them open, it's a very strong smell.

01:15:35.947 --> 01:15:37.097
TALIESIN: I make them all open.

01:15:39.427 --> 01:15:44.427
LAURA: But while we're here, I am going to also cast

01:15:44.557 --> 01:15:48.367
Word of Recall here in this room.

01:15:48.367 --> 01:15:49.200
MATT: Okay.

01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:51.307
LAURA: This is, if there ever would be a temple

01:15:51.307 --> 01:15:53.877
to the Traveler, this is it.

01:15:53.877 --> 01:15:57.557
Since I've painted many drawings of him and other things

01:15:57.557 --> 01:16:00.017
that remind me of him all through the room.

01:16:00.017 --> 01:16:02.044
MATT: Okay. As you guys are here, taking in the space,

01:16:02.044 --> 01:16:04.527
you watch as Jester smiles and closes her eyes

01:16:04.527 --> 01:16:07.287
and begins muttering this quiet...

01:16:08.257 --> 01:16:10.857
as much of a prayer to the Traveler as there can be.

01:16:11.907 --> 01:16:12.994
It's more of just a bunch of like,

01:16:12.994 --> 01:16:15.347
"Hey, you're pretty cool."

01:16:15.347 --> 01:16:17.277
LAURA: This is going to be, like, a cool temple

01:16:17.277 --> 01:16:18.768
that people come to.

01:16:18.768 --> 01:16:22.467
TALIESIN: It sounds like Doo Wah Diddy, I don't know.

01:16:22.467 --> 01:16:24.937
MATT: As she begins to mutter this, it's interesting.

01:16:24.937 --> 01:16:27.977
The room is lit by three separate lanterns

01:16:27.977 --> 01:16:30.337
that give this warm interior glow.

01:16:30.337 --> 01:16:33.507
You watch as they all slowly grow dimmer and dimmer.

01:16:33.507 --> 01:16:37.997
And as they do, certain drawings in the surrounding chamber

01:16:37.997 --> 01:16:40.097
begin to get brighter and brighter.

01:16:40.097 --> 01:16:43.497
You can see numerous dots of green and you can now see

01:16:43.497 --> 01:16:46.547
clearly what was mostly hidden amongst this

01:16:46.547 --> 01:16:51.427
scattering tapestry of sketches throughout her lifetime,

01:16:51.427 --> 01:16:53.827
how many various interpretations of the Traveler

01:16:53.827 --> 01:16:55.897
are hidden throughout this room.

01:16:55.897 --> 01:16:57.487
And now all of them, one by one are all

01:16:57.487 --> 01:17:00.887
giving off this faint green glow

01:17:00.887 --> 01:17:05.657
until eventually the lanterns are nearly extinguished

01:17:05.657 --> 01:17:09.120
and you can see dozens and dozens of these vibrant,

01:17:10.297 --> 01:17:14.337
alighting your faces with the volume of light

01:17:14.337 --> 01:17:17.969
that's coming from this in a green hue, before

01:17:17.969 --> 01:17:19.887
(whooshing) all the lanterns brighten up once again

01:17:19.887 --> 01:17:23.227
and you shake your head, and the color passes.

01:17:23.227 --> 01:17:25.307
And you are now linked to this as a sanctuary

01:17:25.307 --> 01:17:26.707
for Word of Recall.

01:17:26.707 --> 01:17:28.600
LAURA: Great! Did you also do it?

01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:30.187
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, that was my walk earlier.

01:17:30.187 --> 01:17:31.917
I've got everything.

01:17:31.917 --> 01:17:33.690
MARISHA: What did, what did you all do?

01:17:35.047 --> 01:17:38.237
LAURA: Well, if ever we're in a horrible situation

01:17:38.237 --> 01:17:41.444
that Caleb maybe can't get us out of,

01:17:41.444 --> 01:17:45.566
Caduceus and I will be able to
get us back to Nicodranas in a flash.

01:17:45.566 --> 01:17:48.918
TALIESIN: We'll need both of us for everybody, but.

01:17:48.918 --> 01:17:49.751
LAURA: Yeah.

01:17:49.751 --> 01:17:52.600
LIAM: There's always one of us unconscious, so.

01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:53.567
TRAVIS: Mm, mm-hmm.

01:17:56.177 --> 01:17:57.569
MARISHA: All right.

01:17:57.569 --> 01:17:59.674
ASHLEY: It just bamfs us back here?

01:17:59.674 --> 01:18:01.872
TALIESIN: Yep.
ASHLEY: Wow, that's cool!

01:18:02.737 --> 01:18:03.570
LAURA: Yeah.

01:18:03.570 --> 01:18:05.357
TALIESIN: Technically, I'll take us a few blocks away.

01:18:05.357 --> 01:18:07.800
LAURA: Technically, he will!
TALIESIN: Yeah!

01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:11.567
LIAM: Is it very taxing on you to do?

01:18:11.567 --> 01:18:15.677
LAURA: Well, it's almost the top of my skill set,

01:18:15.677 --> 01:18:18.112
but not quite, if you know what I mean.

01:18:18.112 --> 01:18:20.809
(laughter)

01:18:20.809 --> 01:18:21.675
SAM: Oh boy.

01:18:21.675 --> 01:18:24.045
LIAM: At face value, I think so?

01:18:24.045 --> 01:18:26.596
(laughter)

01:18:26.596 --> 01:18:29.737
TRAVIS: Oof.
(laughter)

01:18:29.737 --> 01:18:32.157
TALIESIN: It's not the worst thing, but it's...

01:18:33.397 --> 01:18:35.167
if we've had a real rough time, then hopefully

01:18:35.167 --> 01:18:36.977
we still have the energy for it.

01:18:36.977 --> 01:18:38.260
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: Excellent.

01:18:39.677 --> 01:18:43.217
Two clerics. Not every group of adventurers

01:18:43.217 --> 01:18:45.103
is lucky enough to have two clerics.

01:18:45.103 --> 01:18:45.936
LAURA: Yep.

01:18:45.936 --> 01:18:47.962
LIAM: Right, Matthew?
LAURA: Some don't even have one.

01:18:47.962 --> 01:18:49.240
MATT: Indeed.

01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:50.073
TALIESIN: Foolish people.

01:18:50.073 --> 01:18:51.785
MATT: You almost have more than one healer.

01:18:52.693 --> 01:18:55.492
(groaning)
LAURA: (cackles)

01:18:55.492 --> 01:18:58.127
Oh yeah.

01:18:58.127 --> 01:18:59.011
TALIESIN: That's rough, buddy.

01:18:59.011 --> 01:19:02.297
LIAM: I mean, to be fair, Caduceus is like 1.3 healers.

01:19:02.297 --> 01:19:04.772
TALIESIN: That's true.
LIAM: And Jester's like 0.4.

01:19:04.772 --> 01:19:06.697
So that's a lot of healing.

01:19:06.697 --> 01:19:07.737
MATT: Yeah.
MARISHA: It's pretty good.

01:19:07.737 --> 01:19:10.493
MATT: If you're rounding up, then yeah,
you have two healers.

01:19:10.493 --> 01:19:15.149
TALIESIN: It's like the low-fat milk of healers. It's 98%.

01:19:15.149 --> 01:19:17.939
LAURA: But, you guys, look at my pretty dress I painted.

01:19:17.939 --> 01:19:21.787
(laughter)

01:19:21.787 --> 01:19:23.713
MATT: Different skills. It's fine.

01:19:23.713 --> 01:19:25.337
LIAM: Clerlock?
LAURA: Yeah.

01:19:25.337 --> 01:19:26.628
MATT: All right.

01:19:26.628 --> 01:19:27.819
Is there anything else you wish to accomplish

01:19:27.819 --> 01:19:31.237
for the evening or shall we bring you to the next morning?

01:19:32.993 --> 01:19:34.325
TRAVIS: Next morning.

01:19:34.325 --> 01:19:35.460
MARISHA: Next morning!

01:19:35.460 --> 01:19:36.293
MATT: Okay.

01:19:36.293 --> 01:19:37.985
LIAM: Caleb will... so quick.

01:19:37.985 --> 01:19:40.957
Caleb will take out the smaller book

01:19:40.957 --> 01:19:43.867
and spend 15 minutes writing.

01:19:43.867 --> 01:19:44.987
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: That's all.

01:19:44.987 --> 01:19:49.197
MATT: Cool. All right. You eventually head off to your

01:19:49.197 --> 01:19:51.697
various chambers throughout the Chateau

01:19:51.697 --> 01:19:53.597
and find yourselves getting a good night's sleep

01:19:53.597 --> 01:19:54.797
in a comfortable bed.

01:19:54.797 --> 01:19:58.247
LAURA: Oh, I snuggle up with Mama
since my bed smells like piss.

01:19:58.247 --> 01:20:00.650
MATT: She doesn't argue.

01:20:02.037 --> 01:20:05.687
An early morning wakes you all, as you didn't,

01:20:05.687 --> 01:20:08.707
especially after your odd sleep schedule in Rumblecusp,

01:20:08.707 --> 01:20:11.487
getting yourselves back on a decent schedule.

01:20:11.487 --> 01:20:14.487
You go to bed a little early, wake up a little early.

01:20:14.487 --> 01:20:16.900
At like 7:00, 7:30. Shortly after dawn.

01:20:17.744 --> 01:20:22.572
The morning greets you. You all gather downstairs and a

01:20:22.572 --> 01:20:26.907
morning meal has already been prepared for all of you,

01:20:26.907 --> 01:20:28.665
courtesy of the Chateau itself.

01:20:29.694 --> 01:20:30.661
What would you like to do?

01:20:30.661 --> 01:20:31.805
LAURA: It's great here. Isn't it?

01:20:31.805 --> 01:20:35.177
MARISHA: The breakfast buffet
cannot be beaten. It's so good.

01:20:35.177 --> 01:20:38.107
ASHLEY: This is... A buffet. I can't even.

01:20:38.107 --> 01:20:41.097
You can have anything you want.

01:20:41.097 --> 01:20:42.667
LAURA: And as much as you want!

01:20:42.667 --> 01:20:44.277
ASHLEY: Yeah. It's not like you just get one thing,

01:20:44.277 --> 01:20:45.967
you have every choice.

01:20:45.967 --> 01:20:47.187
TALIESIN: Plates are so small, though.

01:20:47.187 --> 01:20:48.867
I don't know how any of you deal with this.

01:20:48.867 --> 01:20:51.322
ASHLEY: I've went back seven times already.

01:20:51.322 --> 01:20:52.596
TALIESIN: Could I bring my
own plate next time?

01:20:52.596 --> 01:20:54.100
Is that okay?
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Feel free.

01:20:54.100 --> 01:20:57.125
LIAM: Bottomless French toast is amazing.
ASHLEY: BYO Plate? P?

01:20:58.325 --> 01:21:00.373
Bring your own plate?

01:21:00.373 --> 01:21:02.316
MARISHA: BYOP.

01:21:02.316 --> 01:21:07.257
LIAM: But so much asparagus.
Is that, like, a Nicodranas thing?

01:21:07.257 --> 01:21:08.717
TALIESIN: It grows very well. It's hard to kill

01:21:08.717 --> 01:21:09.935
once you got it going.

01:21:09.935 --> 01:21:12.067
LAURA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: It's true.

01:21:12.067 --> 01:21:15.577
MARISHA: I swipe some bacon, put it in my pocket for later.

01:21:15.577 --> 01:21:16.410
MATT: Okay.

01:21:17.329 --> 01:21:20.437
Veth, you can smell the breakfast this early

01:21:20.437 --> 01:21:21.870
in the morning being cooked across the way.

01:21:21.870 --> 01:21:24.267
SAM: Come over for breakfast. So what's going on?

01:21:24.267 --> 01:21:25.100
We going or what?

01:21:25.100 --> 01:21:28.287
LAURA: Yeah. Are Luc and Yussa with you?

01:21:28.287 --> 01:21:29.337
SAM: Yep, they're coming with us.

01:21:29.337 --> 01:21:30.677
LAURA: I don't mean that, but

01:21:30.677 --> 01:21:33.257
they can have some of the free breakfast.

01:21:33.257 --> 01:21:36.077
SAM: They can take-- I mean, we have food.

01:21:36.077 --> 01:21:37.787
LAURA: Yeah, I know. But this breakfast is, like,

01:21:37.787 --> 01:21:39.614
it's like going to the Four Seasons for a free breakfast.

01:21:39.614 --> 01:21:41.752
SAM: They eat here every other day!

01:21:41.752 --> 01:21:43.797
LAURA: Okay, okay.

01:21:43.797 --> 01:21:46.527
SAM: They are sick of it.

01:21:46.527 --> 01:21:49.747
Did you try the bottomless french toast, by the way?

01:21:49.747 --> 01:21:51.386
ASHLEY: I just get up and walk over.

01:21:51.386 --> 01:21:55.069
(laughter)

01:21:56.854 --> 01:21:58.154
SAM: Get some powdered sugar!

01:21:59.767 --> 01:22:03.780
LIAM: Yasha just undoes her
big gnarly belt just, like, one notch.

01:22:05.503 --> 01:22:06.858
LAURA: Woo!

01:22:06.858 --> 01:22:08.920
ASHLEY: I just take it off.

01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:11.783
MATT: Everyone's ready for a--
(strained) whole day of adventuring.

01:22:12.737 --> 01:22:14.423
Getting the pancake sweats.

01:22:14.423 --> 01:22:16.648
MARISHA: Yeah.
LAURA: I'm going to

01:22:16.648 --> 01:22:20.931
just fill my haversack with a lot of
pastries, because it's been awhile.

01:22:20.931 --> 01:22:22.937
MATT: Yeah. Easy enough to do, and there are plenty here.

01:22:22.937 --> 01:22:26.341
So you can write down in your inventory, number of pastries.

01:22:26.341 --> 01:22:27.207
LAURA: Okay.

01:22:27.207 --> 01:22:28.947
TALIESIN: A cornucopia of baked goods.
SAM: I will take some as well.

01:22:28.947 --> 01:22:32.197
LIAM: Veth, here's a question for you.

01:22:32.197 --> 01:22:36.097
We are going to be in Rexxentrum for the week.

01:22:36.097 --> 01:22:38.032
We have a lot of time there and

01:22:38.032 --> 01:22:39.587
we've been away from your family for so long.

01:22:39.587 --> 01:22:43.307
Would you like to bring them with? To Rexxentrum?

01:22:43.307 --> 01:22:44.867
SAM: Is it safe?

01:22:44.867 --> 01:22:46.567
LAURA: Well, we're going to see my dad.

01:22:47.967 --> 01:22:49.175
SAM: Wait, what?

01:22:49.175 --> 01:22:50.951
Your dad is in Rexxentrum?
LIAM: Well, we won't bring them to that,

01:22:50.951 --> 01:22:54.967
but I have a perfect place for us to stay while we're there

01:22:54.967 --> 01:22:57.807
and they could-- they'd be very comfortable.

01:22:57.807 --> 01:23:00.197
SAM: Do we have a place? Do you have a place to stay there?

01:23:00.197 --> 01:23:04.817
LIAM: Yeah. There's an inn that I am
intimately familiar with.

01:23:04.817 --> 01:23:06.985
MARISHA: The Gentleman? The Gentleman's in Rex-- what?

01:23:06.985 --> 01:23:09.947
LAURA: No, The Gentleman's in Zadash, can we go there?

01:23:09.947 --> 01:23:10.887
SAM: Wait, what's going on?

01:23:10.887 --> 01:23:12.495
TALIESIN: I would not say no to that at some point.

01:23:12.495 --> 01:23:14.927
SAM: Are we going to have dinner with the enemy tonight?

01:23:14.927 --> 01:23:16.856
LAURA: You're right. Yes, that's happening tonight.

01:23:16.856 --> 01:23:19.691
LIAM: Zadash and Pumat will have to wait.
LAURA: I mean after dinner. If we survive.

01:23:19.691 --> 01:23:21.622
I want to go see my dad.

01:23:21.622 --> 01:23:23.829
SAM: If I can keep them close, then yeah.

01:23:23.829 --> 01:23:25.154
TRAVIS: (impacts)

01:23:25.154 --> 01:23:25.987
LAURA: Sorry, guys.

01:23:25.987 --> 01:23:30.030
LIAM: Actually, I am familiar with lodging in both

01:23:30.030 --> 01:23:33.473
Zadash and Rexxentrum that could house all of us.

01:23:33.473 --> 01:23:34.306
SAM: Okay.

01:23:35.305 --> 01:23:36.350
Yeah!
LIAM: It's just,

01:23:36.350 --> 01:23:37.183
you've had so little time.

01:23:37.183 --> 01:23:39.047
SAM: I had one day. Yes, no, it would be great

01:23:39.047 --> 01:23:43.017
to keep them around. They can have a little jaunt.

01:23:43.017 --> 01:23:46.357
LIAM: Is everybody-- I mean, obviously, they're not coming

01:23:46.357 --> 01:23:48.257
to a wizard's tower.

01:23:48.257 --> 01:23:49.847
TALIESIN: I think it's a great idea.
LIAM: Good.

01:23:49.847 --> 01:23:52.796
LAURA: As long as, you know, Trent won't be spying on us

01:23:52.796 --> 01:23:56.297
and will use Veth's family as collateral

01:23:56.297 --> 01:23:57.997
and do something evil.

01:23:57.997 --> 01:24:00.607
SAM: Ooh, yeah. Maybe we should leave them here for this,

01:24:00.607 --> 01:24:02.727
until after the Trent dinner and then

01:24:02.727 --> 01:24:04.365
we can bring them up.

01:24:04.365 --> 01:24:05.724
LAURA: Yeah, and then they can come with us to Zadash

01:24:05.724 --> 01:24:07.094
and they can see my dad!

01:24:08.297 --> 01:24:09.130
LIAM: Okay.

01:24:10.787 --> 01:24:11.820
SAM: Yeah. Yeah.

01:24:13.857 --> 01:24:15.865
TALIESIN: I like Zadash. That'll be nice.

01:24:17.597 --> 01:24:19.867
SAM: Yeah. Just in case there's a horrible,

01:24:19.867 --> 01:24:22.007
you know, murder tonight.

01:24:22.007 --> 01:24:23.273
TALIESIN: Murder wizard.

01:24:24.176 --> 01:24:25.467
SAM: Yeah.

01:24:25.467 --> 01:24:27.667
ASHLEY: You say that so happy.

01:24:27.667 --> 01:24:29.117
TALIESIN: Just rolled off the tongue.

01:24:30.487 --> 01:24:32.387
SAM: But thank you for the offer.

01:24:32.387 --> 01:24:35.517
So how do we get there? Are you going to teleport us?

01:24:35.517 --> 01:24:37.250
LIAM: Well,

01:24:37.250 --> 01:24:40.783
I would prefer to be at peak capability

01:24:40.783 --> 01:24:43.271
this evening, if need be, so I would like to use...

01:24:43.271 --> 01:24:44.677
SAM: I have some of that sex potion

01:24:44.677 --> 01:24:47.140
that I didn't use yet, if you need that.

01:24:48.179 --> 01:24:50.622
LIAM: Maybe on another night.

01:24:51.717 --> 01:24:55.227
I just mean if we get pulled into danger.

01:24:55.227 --> 01:24:58.247
So I would prefer to use the library again,

01:24:58.247 --> 01:24:59.597
if that's all right with you.

01:24:59.597 --> 01:25:03.787
MARISHA: Oh yeah. Do we need to go to Yussa to use that?

01:25:03.787 --> 01:25:05.684
Or can we just go from here and then go there?

01:25:05.684 --> 01:25:08.777
LIAM: No, we can go from anywhere, but we would need to land

01:25:10.007 --> 01:25:12.367
at the circle at the Cobalt Soul.

01:25:12.367 --> 01:25:14.317
MARISHA: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's fine.

01:25:15.637 --> 01:25:17.700
LAURA: Do I need to be in peak form tonight?

01:25:21.417 --> 01:25:24.807
LIAM: Well, you rarely are not, but I would advise it, yeah.

01:25:24.807 --> 01:25:27.607
LAURA: Then I probably should not
send a message ahead of us.

01:25:29.019 --> 01:25:30.102
MARISHA: I think...

01:25:30.102 --> 01:25:30.935
LIAM: You're kind of a big deal now.

01:25:30.935 --> 01:25:32.747
MARISHA: We're above that. Exactly.

01:25:32.747 --> 01:25:35.614
And they know that we're coming in and out. It's fine.

01:25:35.614 --> 01:25:38.547
TALIESIN: Only one way to find out, I suppose.

01:25:38.547 --> 01:25:40.740
LIAM: Put your new status to the test.

01:25:41.617 --> 01:25:43.100
MARISHA: Yeah. Let's go.

01:25:45.267 --> 01:25:49.200
LIAM: Okay. So are we ready now? Any last minute things?

01:25:51.047 --> 01:25:53.163
MARISHA: I look out the window.

01:25:54.138 --> 01:25:56.337
Do I see Thaddeus?

01:25:56.337 --> 01:25:57.947
MATT: Make a perception check.
MARISHA: Okay.

01:25:57.947 --> 01:26:01.000
LIAM: Oh man. That'd be the best.

01:26:04.077 --> 01:26:05.718
MARISHA: Look, you're so-- you're too far.

01:26:05.718 --> 01:26:07.051
It's a natural 20!

01:26:07.051 --> 01:26:09.197
I swear to god, it's a natural 20.

01:26:09.197 --> 01:26:10.930
TALIESIN: It's just lumps of rock.

01:26:10.930 --> 01:26:13.766
MARISHA: It's that one. It's that. It's 24 total.

01:26:13.766 --> 01:26:14.599
MATT: Okay.

01:26:16.577 --> 01:26:17.937
As they're all having this conversation,

01:26:17.937 --> 01:26:19.877
getting ready, you just glance over your shoulder,

01:26:19.877 --> 01:26:23.183
out the window and you see about

01:26:23.183 --> 01:26:25.078
a block and a half down the way

01:26:25.078 --> 01:26:26.857
(wings flapping)

01:26:26.857 --> 01:26:27.827
something fly.

01:26:27.827 --> 01:26:31.740
MARISHA: Son of a bitch. Right before we poof.

01:26:33.107 --> 01:26:35.237
MATT: Well, you have to step through.

01:26:35.237 --> 01:26:37.091
MARISHA: Son of a bi--

01:26:38.542 --> 01:26:40.737
MATT: (thudding, whooshing)

01:26:40.737 --> 01:26:42.536
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs) Yeah.

01:26:43.438 --> 01:26:44.437
TALIESIN: (magic pulsing)

01:26:44.437 --> 01:26:45.270
MARISHA: What?!

01:26:47.297 --> 01:26:50.647
MATT: As you all emerge--
LIAM: (hooting)

01:26:50.647 --> 01:26:52.505
MATT: -- in the familiar subterranean basement

01:26:52.505 --> 01:26:55.460
of the Rexxentrum Archive of the Cobalt Soul.

01:26:56.337 --> 01:26:57.897
You can see there is an individual

01:26:57.897 --> 01:26:59.880
who is sitting there,

01:27:00.867 --> 01:27:04.397
currently writing in a small book, glance up and...

01:27:04.397 --> 01:27:05.597
(chair screeches)

01:27:05.597 --> 01:27:06.747
MARISHA: Don't worry about it.

01:27:09.062 --> 01:27:10.867
Expositor Beau.

01:27:10.867 --> 01:27:12.479
MATT: "Right."
MARISHA: Thanks.

01:27:12.479 --> 01:27:14.572
MATT: "We weren't made aware of, um..."

01:27:15.692 --> 01:27:18.827
LAURA: I was going to send you a message ahead of time,

01:27:18.827 --> 01:27:21.717
but I need all my spells, you know.

01:27:21.717 --> 01:27:22.550
MATT: "Certainly."

01:27:24.782 --> 01:27:28.827
As you guys all walk past, make your way up into the

01:27:28.827 --> 01:27:31.357
library proper, once again the massive interior

01:27:31.357 --> 01:27:33.207
of this amazing library.

01:27:33.207 --> 01:27:38.207
Since last you were here, meeting with Yudala Fon

01:27:38.531 --> 01:27:40.607
and a few other members, Crook, the day before.

01:27:40.607 --> 01:27:41.937
LIAM: Yeah.

01:27:41.937 --> 01:27:43.127
MATT: What would you like to do?

01:27:43.127 --> 01:27:47.272
MARISHA: I guess-- nah. She said she'd contact me.

01:27:47.272 --> 01:27:49.177
MATT: They.
MARISHA: They'd contact me.

01:27:49.177 --> 01:27:51.219
It's fine. Let's just move on.

01:27:51.219 --> 01:27:53.227
MATT: Okay. All right.

01:27:53.227 --> 01:27:56.187
SAM: What time is it? Midday?

01:27:56.187 --> 01:27:58.057
MATT: No, right now it's early morning. You guys have

01:27:58.057 --> 01:28:00.337
plenty of time. Is there anything you want to do

01:28:00.337 --> 01:28:02.923
before tonight in Rexxentrum or otherwise?

01:28:02.923 --> 01:28:04.807
If you have means of teleport and such, like,

01:28:04.807 --> 01:28:07.880
you have ways to go. So.

01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:09.057
TRAVIS: I love Matt.

01:28:09.057 --> 01:28:10.737
MATT: I'm just saying don't feel constrained.

01:28:10.737 --> 01:28:12.070
TRAVIS: "You're all just going to dinner, huh?

01:28:12.070 --> 01:28:13.663
"Just going to dinner!"

01:28:13.663 --> 01:28:15.651
(laughter)

01:28:15.651 --> 01:28:17.334
TRAVIS: "You got all day!"

01:28:18.616 --> 01:28:19.747
ASHLEY: Just want to go straight in.

01:28:19.747 --> 01:28:21.719
TALIESIN: Clock's ticking.
MATT: I mean, you totally can!

01:28:21.719 --> 01:28:23.716
LAURA: No, no, no.
LIAM: Sun's still shining on you.

01:28:23.716 --> 01:28:25.657
LAURA: We should get some winter clothes, getting

01:28:25.657 --> 01:28:28.597
prepared so that it can be made while we're,

01:28:28.597 --> 01:28:29.932
you know, doing other things.

01:28:29.932 --> 01:28:30.990
MARISHA: Yeah.
LIAM: Okay.

01:28:30.990 --> 01:28:32.543
LAURA: Sometimes it might take, like, a week to get

01:28:32.543 --> 01:28:33.667
a coat made or something.

01:28:33.667 --> 01:28:37.337
ASHLEY: Was there any research? Did we already research

01:28:37.337 --> 01:28:39.781
the Nine Eyes and all that stuff that we were going to do?

01:28:39.781 --> 01:28:40.757
LIAM: Beauregard's delegating.

01:28:40.757 --> 01:28:42.463
TALIESIN: Going through there.
ASHLEY: That's right. That's right.

01:28:42.463 --> 01:28:44.397
TALIESIN: Going to your dad, I think that would be

01:28:44.397 --> 01:28:45.997
a good thing to poke around in.

01:28:45.997 --> 01:28:47.534
ASHLEY: Before we...
LAURA: Yeah.

01:28:47.534 --> 01:28:49.007
But not today.

01:28:49.007 --> 01:28:50.877
LIAM: Not today.
TALIESIN: Tomorrow.

01:28:50.877 --> 01:28:55.377
LIAM: But you're right, we could get some clothing orders

01:28:55.377 --> 01:28:58.027
in now, so that they'll be done hopefully by the end

01:28:58.027 --> 01:29:00.127
of the week, because it is going to be cold

01:29:00.127 --> 01:29:04.507
as a motherfuck up on top of the world.

01:29:04.507 --> 01:29:07.087
TRAVIS: Do I have this map or is this just for reference?

01:29:07.087 --> 01:29:08.427
Was this given to us?

01:29:08.427 --> 01:29:10.299
MATT: That was given to you...

01:29:12.145 --> 01:29:15.907
Or, actually, DeRogna still has it, but showed it to you.

01:29:15.907 --> 01:29:16.740
TRAVIS: Cool. Nevermind.

01:29:16.740 --> 01:29:20.521
MATT: So, and with your keen mind,
you would have a very clear.

01:29:20.521 --> 01:29:22.567
LIAM: (high-pitched nerdy groan)
MATT: Yep. Just like that.

01:29:22.567 --> 01:29:23.792
That's the sound it makes every time you use it.

01:29:23.792 --> 01:29:28.583
LAURA: Should we research the city of Aeor?

01:29:28.583 --> 01:29:30.549
Eeyore? Aeor?
SAM: Eh.

01:29:31.847 --> 01:29:34.567
LIAM: (mimics character of Eeyore) The fine city of Aeor.

01:29:34.567 --> 01:29:36.364
MATT: You guys can research whatever you want to

01:29:36.364 --> 01:29:37.197
with the time you got.

01:29:37.197 --> 01:29:38.347
LAURA: Because we're here.

01:29:38.347 --> 01:29:39.422
MARISHA: I'm fine with that.

01:29:39.422 --> 01:29:40.737
LAURA: We got in the library, might as well.

01:29:40.737 --> 01:29:42.077
MARISHA: I'm going to check with the monks, too,

01:29:42.077 --> 01:29:45.760
to see if they actually have some winter garb

01:29:46.617 --> 01:29:50.884
that might be a little bit more official, uniform.

01:29:50.884 --> 01:29:52.527
LAURA: Good call, good call.
MARISHA: So yeah.

01:29:52.527 --> 01:29:56.727
So I'll actually double back inside.

01:29:56.727 --> 01:29:57.560
MATT: Okay.

01:29:58.787 --> 01:30:03.227
MARISHA: And yeah, talk to somebody,
and be like, "Outfit me."

01:30:03.227 --> 01:30:08.227
MATT: Okay. Some of the various archivists,

01:30:08.227 --> 01:30:12.647
or the keepers of the library take you to one of the

01:30:12.647 --> 01:30:14.087
outfitting chambers there where they have a lot of their

01:30:14.087 --> 01:30:16.847
standard uniforms for different positions,

01:30:16.847 --> 01:30:19.820
as well as different weather, and battle armaments and such.

01:30:20.657 --> 01:30:25.107
They don't have anything that is on its own prepared

01:30:25.107 --> 01:30:28.927
for the cold that you've been told to prepare for.

01:30:28.927 --> 01:30:33.927
But there are some "expositor plus" gear that you can bring

01:30:34.007 --> 01:30:37.147
that is the beginnings of an outfit that is prepared

01:30:37.147 --> 01:30:39.817
for the weather you're going to be encountering.

01:30:39.817 --> 01:30:42.757
Heavy fur lining in some cases,

01:30:42.757 --> 01:30:45.547
thicker pants with multiple layers,

01:30:45.547 --> 01:30:47.897
heavy boots that are designed for harsher terrain

01:30:47.897 --> 01:30:51.317
as well as to prevent moisture from soaking into the center.

01:30:51.317 --> 01:30:52.627
So you get some elements like that.

01:30:52.627 --> 01:30:54.927
You still would probably need to supplement that with

01:30:54.927 --> 01:30:57.527
like cloak, hood, and probably something

01:30:57.527 --> 01:30:59.477
for your arms, if you really want to.

01:30:59.477 --> 01:31:02.717
MARISHA: Okay. I'll grab a pair of pants, like baggy,

01:31:02.717 --> 01:31:05.717
almost look like gaucho pants that are fur-lined.

01:31:05.717 --> 01:31:08.057
Take my expositor belt that Dairon gave me

01:31:08.057 --> 01:31:10.117
that I haven't really adorned yet,

01:31:10.117 --> 01:31:12.970
and officially tie it around my waist.

01:31:13.818 --> 01:31:16.447
It's a slate gray that fades,

01:31:16.447 --> 01:31:19.114
very much in the style that my first belt went to,

01:31:19.114 --> 01:31:21.935
but fades to a royal cobalt blue.

01:31:24.417 --> 01:31:28.120
And then I grab a fur-lined vest off as well.

01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:30.477
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: Just throw that on. Start there.

01:31:30.477 --> 01:31:31.837
MATT: Okay.

01:31:31.837 --> 01:31:33.437
MARISHA: Do they have any, like, pins or anything?

01:31:33.437 --> 01:31:37.233
Like Ioun pins or badges or something? I don't know.

01:31:38.067 --> 01:31:41.037
MATT: I mean, there are different elements of iconography

01:31:41.037 --> 01:31:43.307
that you can use to adorn yourself, if you like.

01:31:43.307 --> 01:31:46.120
You may have to refashion, or fashion it to you.

01:31:46.120 --> 01:31:48.637
MARISHA: Like a little All-Seeing Eye broach or something.

01:31:48.637 --> 01:31:49.990
MATT: Okay. You got it.

01:31:50.957 --> 01:31:52.496
LIAM: Some TGIF flair?

01:31:52.496 --> 01:31:56.120
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I hate Mondays. Yeah.

01:31:56.120 --> 01:31:58.827
MATT: Yeah. Not a lot of flair in the library there,

01:31:58.827 --> 01:32:01.114
unfortunately. All right.

01:32:01.114 --> 01:32:04.855
MARISHA: And then I guess on the way out,

01:32:04.855 --> 01:32:06.421
I'll grab Caleb.

01:32:06.421 --> 01:32:07.857
Should we-- should we do some research?

01:32:07.857 --> 01:32:09.240
Wanna hit the books?

01:32:10.097 --> 01:32:12.557
LIAM: You want to look into flying cities?

01:32:12.557 --> 01:32:15.040
MARISHA: I guess, I don't know what else to do with my time.

01:32:15.953 --> 01:32:17.167
LIAM: (sighs)

01:32:17.167 --> 01:32:20.902
Yeah, we have to-- I still need to go shopping, but.

01:32:20.902 --> 01:32:23.897
MARISHA: Well, how about you go shop. I'll pull some books.

01:32:23.897 --> 01:32:26.087
Feel free to come back whenever.

01:32:26.087 --> 01:32:28.267
LIAM: You pull books, and then I will come back

01:32:28.267 --> 01:32:29.377
and help you read.

01:32:29.377 --> 01:32:30.612
MARISHA: Great.
LIAM: Okay.

01:32:31.467 --> 01:32:32.877
MARISHA: I start my thing.

01:32:32.877 --> 01:32:34.277
MATT: All right. What are you researching?

01:32:34.277 --> 01:32:35.917
Who's researching what while you're here?

01:32:35.917 --> 01:32:38.097
MARISHA: I'm going to talk to one of the scribes.

01:32:38.097 --> 01:32:43.097
One of the archivists. Aeor, fall-foul-Farlan... wait.

01:32:43.807 --> 01:32:46.424
Todd McFarland. What was...

01:32:46.424 --> 01:32:48.747
TRAVIS: Foren?
MARISHA: Foren? Yes.

01:32:49.837 --> 01:32:50.670
That.

01:32:53.448 --> 01:32:56.577
And anything about potential, like, weapons or magics

01:32:56.577 --> 01:32:57.777
or anything that we might find there.

01:32:57.777 --> 01:32:59.829
TRAVIS: Allowak's Sanctuary?

01:32:59.829 --> 01:33:01.770
MARISHA: And the Allowak's Sanctuary.

01:33:02.737 --> 01:33:07.620
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll an investigation check for me.

01:33:09.547 --> 01:33:13.063
MARISHA: Okay. [inaudible muttering]

01:33:13.921 --> 01:33:17.407
All right. Don't fuck this up. Don't fuck this up.

01:33:17.407 --> 01:33:21.923
Okay. Okay. Uh...

01:33:21.923 --> 01:33:23.337
26.

01:33:23.337 --> 01:33:24.767
LAURA: Ooh!

01:33:24.767 --> 01:33:26.638
MARISHA: Rolled a 17.
MATT: Not bad.

01:33:26.638 --> 01:33:28.357
Okay.

01:33:28.357 --> 01:33:33.037
Foren is the name of the centralmost and largest

01:33:33.037 --> 01:33:35.530
body of land in Eiselcross.

01:33:35.530 --> 01:33:38.592
Eiselcross is made up of numerous smaller

01:33:40.257 --> 01:33:42.257
sections of land, like islands, larger islands,

01:33:42.257 --> 01:33:44.357
that cluster around its space there.

01:33:45.362 --> 01:33:47.087
Most of the area is above the tree line.

01:33:47.087 --> 01:33:49.367
There are some sporadic trees and such,

01:33:49.367 --> 01:33:51.500
but a lot of it's just open snowy tundra.

01:33:52.337 --> 01:33:57.137
Blizzard-scarred landscapes, and jagged mountains

01:33:57.137 --> 01:33:59.303
of gray and white stone.

01:34:01.531 --> 01:34:02.364
You...

01:34:03.415 --> 01:34:06.047
There's not a whole lot to the history there.

01:34:06.047 --> 01:34:10.867
There is no historical value to the location

01:34:10.867 --> 01:34:12.277
that is recorded necessarily.

01:34:12.277 --> 01:34:15.920
It's too far north for people to go and want to live.

01:34:16.857 --> 01:34:21.390
So it seems like the first society

01:34:21.390 --> 01:34:22.465
that went that direction,

01:34:22.465 --> 01:34:24.577
out of just general curiosity and expedition attempts

01:34:24.577 --> 01:34:26.637
was through Uthodurn.

01:34:26.637 --> 01:34:27.862
MARISHA: Okay.

01:34:29.789 --> 01:34:31.847
MATT: And there was a village of Syrinlya

01:34:31.847 --> 01:34:34.307
that was founded by them, but it was mainly

01:34:34.307 --> 01:34:35.837
just a fishing village that was trying to take up

01:34:35.837 --> 01:34:37.997
whatever resources were available on that northern side.

01:34:37.997 --> 01:34:39.807
Not too terribly far from where Uthodurn was,

01:34:39.807 --> 01:34:42.320
just across the sea comparatively.

01:34:43.247 --> 01:34:47.029
And you also learn that

01:34:49.047 --> 01:34:53.827
there were strange artifacts being brought back from

01:34:54.771 --> 01:34:59.040
those small outposts of Uthodurn
that were being traded south.

01:35:00.157 --> 01:35:02.784
And this is over the past half a century or so.

01:35:02.784 --> 01:35:03.643
MARISHA: Oh.

01:35:03.643 --> 01:35:07.027
MATT: They were just strange little sections of

01:35:07.027 --> 01:35:09.517
relics and things that-- some were nonfunctional,

01:35:09.517 --> 01:35:12.007
some held some power within them still.

01:35:12.007 --> 01:35:15.247
And that's what began to draw

01:35:15.247 --> 01:35:20.247
the curiosity and interest of the Empire.

01:35:21.143 --> 01:35:23.262
And then the Empire began to build their own outpost

01:35:23.262 --> 01:35:25.807
up there, known as Balenpost.

01:35:25.807 --> 01:35:28.112
MARISHA: That's Balenpost. Okay.

01:35:29.177 --> 01:35:30.967
MATT: You learn that the journey northward--

01:35:30.967 --> 01:35:35.184
technically it's a shorter ship ride between

01:35:36.077 --> 01:35:39.507
Bysaes Tyl, which is the northernmost elven,

01:35:39.507 --> 01:35:41.767
primarily elven city of the Empire.

01:35:41.767 --> 01:35:44.797
However, the Frozen Depths of that ocean channel there

01:35:44.797 --> 01:35:46.987
is extremely dangerous to travel.

01:35:46.987 --> 01:35:50.847
So most people prefer to go the lengthier, but safer route

01:35:50.847 --> 01:35:54.518
from Palebank Village to the south area of Foren.

01:35:57.327 --> 01:36:00.972
To confirm what you heard from Vess DeRogna,

01:36:02.467 --> 01:36:05.194
there are number of regions on the island of Foren

01:36:05.194 --> 01:36:09.667
and a lot across Eiselcross that just have strange flares

01:36:09.667 --> 01:36:14.667
and odd regions of wild magic, where magic of all kinds

01:36:14.867 --> 01:36:17.817
seems to be bent or twisted

01:36:17.817 --> 01:36:21.877
and having effects that you weren't expecting.

01:36:21.877 --> 01:36:25.010
Certain incantations could give you odd, unexpected results.

01:36:25.010 --> 01:36:28.343
Certain incantations could give you odd, unexpected results.

01:36:28.343 --> 01:36:29.877
And depending on the powers that are

01:36:29.877 --> 01:36:33.929
attempting to be evoked, can be extremely dangerous.

01:36:33.929 --> 01:36:37.135
MARISHA: And that's any magic user that was attempting to...

01:36:37.135 --> 01:36:37.968
MATT: Correct.

01:36:39.018 --> 01:36:40.036
MARISHA: Okay.

01:36:40.036 --> 01:36:41.169
MATT: With that roll--
MARISHA: So-- okay.

01:36:41.169 --> 01:36:45.536
MATT: With that roll, there's only
a little bit of information

01:36:45.536 --> 01:36:50.327
that's coming directly from Eiselcross and the excavations

01:36:50.327 --> 01:36:52.367
currently to the Cobalt Soul, because it is a very,

01:36:52.367 --> 01:36:55.317
very carefully guarded location.

01:36:55.317 --> 01:36:59.109
And for the most part, there is a...

01:37:01.007 --> 01:37:04.187
There's a lot of mistrust up north and there are a lot of--

01:37:05.067 --> 01:37:07.727
apparently a number of decades, still, of

01:37:07.727 --> 01:37:10.367
subtle skirmishes and elements of violence

01:37:10.367 --> 01:37:12.287
and bloodshed between the Dynasty and the Empire

01:37:12.287 --> 01:37:14.027
in those regions before the war ever broke out.

01:37:14.027 --> 01:37:18.050
And most likely after the peace was even set, recently.

01:37:18.907 --> 01:37:20.633
Based around these excavations.

01:37:20.633 --> 01:37:21.466
MARISHA: Okay.

01:37:21.466 --> 01:37:24.197
MATT: And there is the central excavation, the biggest one

01:37:24.197 --> 01:37:27.487
where it is believed where these relics came from.

01:37:27.487 --> 01:37:30.577
And many people surmise that at least a portion

01:37:30.577 --> 01:37:35.417
of the ancient city of Aeor exists.

01:37:35.417 --> 01:37:39.077
And there are smaller sites throughout where smaller pieces

01:37:39.077 --> 01:37:42.302
may have fallen, where similar relics had been uncovered.

01:37:43.177 --> 01:37:46.337
MARISHA: Can I go talk to another one of the archivists or

01:37:46.337 --> 01:37:48.487
whatever, and I'm going to point at

01:37:48.487 --> 01:37:51.397
the artifacts that he's talking about,

01:37:51.397 --> 01:37:54.597
or that I'm reading about, and just ask if

01:37:54.597 --> 01:37:59.547
we have any here we're holding on to?

01:37:59.547 --> 01:38:02.957
MATT: "Unfortunately we do not. Most of those have been

01:38:02.957 --> 01:38:07.627
"put under the... (sighs) put under...

01:38:07.627 --> 01:38:12.400
"They have been <i>taken</i>
and are maintained by the Cerberus Assembly."

01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:16.667
MARISHA: I knew that's what you
were going to fucking say. Okay.

01:38:16.667 --> 01:38:19.247
All right. Okay.

01:38:19.247 --> 01:38:23.807
MATT: As far as Aeor itself, with that roll,

01:38:23.807 --> 01:38:26.240
there isn't a lot of information.

01:38:27.077 --> 01:38:30.217
What you do know corresponds with some information

01:38:30.217 --> 01:38:33.217
you've already uncovered. It was a mageocracy.

01:38:33.217 --> 01:38:36.457
It was considered one of the most powerful, if not the most

01:38:36.457 --> 01:38:40.207
powerful of the pre-Calamity,

01:38:41.107 --> 01:38:44.473
arcane-centric societies.

01:38:46.937 --> 01:38:49.007
It was massive.

01:38:49.007 --> 01:38:54.007
It was quite populated, and

01:38:54.500 --> 01:38:58.366
was driven by the belief

01:38:58.366 --> 01:39:01.949
that mortality--

01:39:01.949 --> 01:39:06.949
the gift of magic to the mortal was a gift

01:39:07.580 --> 01:39:12.245
as well as a challenge by the gods to eventually show

01:39:12.245 --> 01:39:15.492
that the creations can become the creator.

01:39:16.437 --> 01:39:21.430
The idea that if a mortal can acquire this much power

01:39:21.430 --> 01:39:22.754
The idea that if a mortal can acquire this much power

01:39:22.754 --> 01:39:27.417
to destroy its own creator, then does that not make itself--

01:39:27.417 --> 01:39:30.491
the gods themselves, you know, as they are.

01:39:30.491 --> 01:39:34.207
And that belief

01:39:34.207 --> 01:39:35.815
varied throughout the populace there,

01:39:35.815 --> 01:39:38.517
but those in power firmly felt that there was...

01:39:42.227 --> 01:39:47.227
there was a drive to, whether it be

01:39:47.652 --> 01:39:50.485
to save Exandria from the destruction of the coming Calamity

01:39:50.485 --> 01:39:52.947
by eliminating the Pantheon entirely,

01:39:52.947 --> 01:39:55.287
or for personally selfish reasons.

01:39:55.287 --> 01:39:57.447
There's no specific record.

01:39:57.447 --> 01:39:59.797
Most of this is just hearsay from survivors

01:39:59.797 --> 01:40:02.087
of other parts of the region.

01:40:02.087 --> 01:40:03.867
It is believed that there were

01:40:03.867 --> 01:40:06.237
no survivors of the fall of Aeor.

01:40:06.237 --> 01:40:10.247
There is no written or verbal record

01:40:10.247 --> 01:40:13.147
from inside the society, all from those that--

01:40:14.262 --> 01:40:15.096
MARISHA: Remember it.

01:40:15.096 --> 01:40:16.917
MATT: -- remember it from an outside perspective.

01:40:16.917 --> 01:40:19.527
MARISHA: Pompeii style.
MATT: If you will.

01:40:19.527 --> 01:40:21.321
MARISHA: People from Crete watching it go down.

01:40:21.321 --> 01:40:22.813
MATT: Yeah.
MARISHA: Okay.

01:40:25.427 --> 01:40:26.527
All right.

01:40:30.987 --> 01:40:32.337
MATT: Anything else?

01:40:32.337 --> 01:40:35.007
MARISHA: I relay all that info to him when he comes back.

01:40:35.007 --> 01:40:35.840
MATT: Okay.

01:40:38.247 --> 01:40:41.145
LIAM: Put a pin in that. I want to return to that.

01:40:42.537 --> 01:40:43.567
Well, we're going shopping.

01:40:43.567 --> 01:40:45.267
LAURA: Yeah, I want to buy clothes!

01:40:45.267 --> 01:40:50.267
MATT: Okay! All right. I'd say...

01:40:51.217 --> 01:40:53.507
LIAM: I would have some idea of where to look for

01:40:53.507 --> 01:40:55.567
sturdy fare, finer fare.

01:40:55.567 --> 01:40:56.400
MATT: Oh yeah.

01:40:56.400 --> 01:40:58.557
LIAM: Fashionable, but also functional.

01:40:58.557 --> 01:41:00.753
LAURA: I want fashionable.

01:41:00.753 --> 01:41:02.761
TALIESIN: You want to look good.

01:41:02.761 --> 01:41:04.153
For the nobody that we're going to see, we want...

01:41:04.153 --> 01:41:08.141
SAM: Yeah, if we're going into the
tundra, we want to look hot.

01:41:08.141 --> 01:41:09.601
TALIESIN: Exquisite corpses.

01:41:09.601 --> 01:41:11.496
LIAM: You want to <i>be</i> hot.

01:41:11.496 --> 01:41:13.545
MATT: Look, it's important. I respect that.

01:41:14.777 --> 01:41:15.793
All righty.

01:41:19.324 --> 01:41:21.257
We'll say within the Vigil Circle,

01:41:21.257 --> 01:41:24.907
you find a-- for lack of a better term,

01:41:24.907 --> 01:41:27.453
the garment district of Rexxentrum.

01:41:28.537 --> 01:41:31.717
There are a number of supplies and wholesalers and

01:41:31.717 --> 01:41:35.820
textile warehouses that sell fine materials, fabric silks,

01:41:36.667 --> 01:41:39.197
both crafted within the Empire and imported from beyond.

01:41:39.197 --> 01:41:41.497
And there are a number of very, very talented,

01:41:42.607 --> 01:41:46.547
for a price, of course, custom tailors that can be hired

01:41:46.547 --> 01:41:48.817
and commissioned for specific pieces.

01:41:48.817 --> 01:41:50.917
So what is it you're looking to have made?

01:41:52.947 --> 01:41:56.197
LIAM: I am looking to return to my Empire roots

01:41:56.197 --> 01:42:01.107
and I commission a long, thick, warm coat,

01:42:01.107 --> 01:42:04.527
very much akin to the coat that everyone met me in.

01:42:04.527 --> 01:42:08.737
However, this one will not be moth-eaten and disgusting.

01:42:08.737 --> 01:42:13.403
So it will be brown and leather,

01:42:13.403 --> 01:42:15.703
long coat, fur-lined.

01:42:15.703 --> 01:42:20.027
I will get a very thick scarf and I will also find a

01:42:20.027 --> 01:42:24.807
leather worker who can build me a new harness for my books.

01:42:24.807 --> 01:42:27.257
The spell book is getting pretty fat

01:42:27.257 --> 01:42:29.497
and can no longer fit under my armpit.

01:42:29.497 --> 01:42:33.577
So the book on the left will still hang about here,

01:42:33.577 --> 01:42:35.110
but I have--

01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:39.576
I describe a case or a harness that is more

01:42:39.576 --> 01:42:42.557
phone book-sized that hangs off of my right hip.

01:42:42.557 --> 01:42:44.307
MATT: Right. Almost like a side satchel.

01:42:44.307 --> 01:42:47.377
LIAM: Yeah. But then I want them to have it hooked

01:42:47.377 --> 01:42:50.107
to my belt so that it's not flying all over the place

01:42:50.107 --> 01:42:52.537
when we are running for our dear lives.

01:42:52.537 --> 01:42:53.377
MARISHA: Cool.

01:42:53.377 --> 01:42:57.577
LIAM: And then that will be counterbalanced
by my old satchel,

01:42:57.577 --> 01:43:00.167
which I will keep, where I keep all my spell components

01:43:00.167 --> 01:43:01.757
and other odds and ends.

01:43:01.757 --> 01:43:04.957
MATT: All righty. Okay. I'd say you
have all those pieces commissioned.

01:43:04.957 --> 01:43:08.217
It'll take a few days to gather the materials

01:43:08.217 --> 01:43:11.419
and create the pieces and it'll run you about

01:43:12.997 --> 01:43:15.127
25 gold pieces for the entire outfit.

01:43:15.127 --> 01:43:15.960
LIAM: Done.

01:43:17.477 --> 01:43:18.804
MATT: Okay.

01:43:18.804 --> 01:43:20.267
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: Mm-hmm.

01:43:20.267 --> 01:43:22.227
LAURA: I just drew it, so I'm going to just describe

01:43:22.227 --> 01:43:23.927
what I just came up with.

01:43:23.927 --> 01:43:28.026
I'm going to go and get--

01:43:28.026 --> 01:43:32.893
Okay, I'm going to get a light blue tunic

01:43:33.801 --> 01:43:35.376
with long sleeves.

01:43:35.376 --> 01:43:37.237
I don't need, like, super thick stuff because

01:43:37.237 --> 01:43:39.377
I am resistant to the cold, so.

01:43:39.377 --> 01:43:42.407
This is more for fashion. A tunic.

01:43:42.407 --> 01:43:44.847
I'm going to get some light gray,

01:43:44.847 --> 01:43:47.117
thermal tights sort of thing.

01:43:47.117 --> 01:43:49.415
And then I'm going to get some...

01:43:49.415 --> 01:43:50.782
SAM: Arc'teryx?
TRAVIS: Yup.

01:43:50.782 --> 01:43:51.796
LAURA: (giggles)

01:43:51.796 --> 01:43:53.417
You know, D&amp;D tights.

01:43:53.417 --> 01:43:54.913
TRAVIS: $250. Yeah.
SAM: Under Armour.

01:43:54.913 --> 01:43:56.295
LAURA: I'm going to get...

01:43:56.295 --> 01:43:58.460
LIAM: She's resistant, so she'll only take half damage.

01:43:59.517 --> 01:44:03.297
LAURA: I'm going to get some long, knitted thigh highs

01:44:03.297 --> 01:44:05.047
that are, like, knitted like Fair Isle.

01:44:05.047 --> 01:44:07.027
Anybody that knows me know what I'm talking about.

01:44:07.027 --> 01:44:11.293
It's stripes and stuff with designs
knitted into them, you know,

01:44:11.293 --> 01:44:13.595
It's stripes and stuff with designs
knitted into them, you know,

01:44:13.595 --> 01:44:17.944
that are, like, flowers and bees.

01:44:17.944 --> 01:44:20.287
I want to get bees knitted into them.

01:44:20.287 --> 01:44:23.187
And I imagine this will cost a pretty penny

01:44:23.187 --> 01:44:27.487
because it is pretty specific, but it's going to be in

01:44:27.487 --> 01:44:32.403
a pale blue and white

01:44:32.403 --> 01:44:33.953
and light gray.

01:44:35.067 --> 01:44:40.067
And then I'm going to get an overcoat that is white

01:44:40.097 --> 01:44:45.097
and it's fur-lined with a pale gray fur,

01:44:45.397 --> 01:44:47.257
so it's showing the trim

01:44:47.257 --> 01:44:49.417
and I want it to be bell sleeves.

01:44:49.417 --> 01:44:53.173
And then, and it will be fitted to about here and then

01:44:53.173 --> 01:44:54.667
it's going to flare out and it's going to have a

01:44:54.667 --> 01:44:59.312
little hood on it. Um, yeah! That's pretty much it!

01:44:59.312 --> 01:45:00.209
MATT: As you finish---

01:45:00.209 --> 01:45:03.037
LAURA: Oh, and I'm going to get some earmuffs to match that.

01:45:03.037 --> 01:45:05.997
And some boots, you know, that are fur-lined boots.

01:45:05.997 --> 01:45:08.414
Obviously to look good,

01:45:08.414 --> 01:45:10.637
that are going to match my coat and stuff.

01:45:10.637 --> 01:45:12.146
LIAM: Matt is the store clerk.

01:45:12.146 --> 01:45:14.447
MATT: No, that is exactly what I was going to--

01:45:14.447 --> 01:45:16.057
As you finish your statement, you look up and you see

01:45:16.057 --> 01:45:18.717
the middle-aged gentleman with his glasses,

01:45:18.717 --> 01:45:22.747
his chin tuft of white goatee, his hair slicked back

01:45:22.747 --> 01:45:25.187
with this pencil sticking out through the back of his ear.

01:45:25.187 --> 01:45:30.147
Just going, "And how soon did you need this, lass?"

01:45:30.147 --> 01:45:32.228
LAURA: In, like, a week? Is that doable?

01:45:33.967 --> 01:45:35.917
MATT: "Give me just a second."
LAURA: Okay.

01:45:37.697 --> 01:45:39.137
MATT: He rushes off to the back room

01:45:39.137 --> 01:45:40.126
and you hear some voices, like,

01:45:40.126 --> 01:45:43.443
(whispering)

01:45:46.121 --> 01:45:49.717
"I think we should be able to take care of your request.

01:45:49.717 --> 01:45:54.517
"Of course, this is quite a commission

01:45:54.517 --> 01:45:57.267
"in a very tight period with very specific materials

01:45:57.267 --> 01:46:00.517
"and with quite a number of

01:46:00.517 --> 01:46:03.241
"custom knitted elements."
LAURA: Yes, oh yeah.

01:46:03.241 --> 01:46:05.467
You'll have to have a very good knitter.

01:46:05.467 --> 01:46:07.830
MATT: "We can do this outfit for...

01:46:11.321 --> 01:46:13.167
"120 gold pieces."

01:46:13.167 --> 01:46:16.283
LAURA: Ooh, I'll give you 500 gold,

01:46:16.283 --> 01:46:19.258
and I would like if it had--

01:46:19.258 --> 01:46:23.252
could you add some embroidery along the coat edges as well?

01:46:24.787 --> 01:46:25.767
MATT: "Of course."

01:46:25.767 --> 01:46:29.617
LAURA: Wonderful. I would love some pink and blue flowers

01:46:29.617 --> 01:46:32.627
and maybe some pale yellow bees embroidered on there

01:46:32.627 --> 01:46:36.077
as well, with some beautiful green, like, vines wrapping

01:46:36.077 --> 01:46:38.307
around everything, you know, like an emerald green?

01:46:38.307 --> 01:46:40.717
Something that really reminds you of the Tra--

01:46:40.717 --> 01:46:44.057
Something like, you know, just a pretty green.

01:46:44.057 --> 01:46:46.256
MATT: "Right, I am following you. Yes."

01:46:46.256 --> 01:46:48.253
LAURA: Yes.
MATT: "All right. Yes.

01:46:48.253 --> 01:46:51.367
"That will definitely be done.

01:46:51.367 --> 01:46:53.207
"I think you'll be very happy with the results."

01:46:53.207 --> 01:46:54.487
LAURA: Wonderful. Thank you so much.

01:46:54.487 --> 01:46:56.187
MATT: "Of course, of course.

01:46:56.187 --> 01:46:58.167
"Uh, half upfront and then half upon the

01:46:58.167 --> 01:47:00.523
completion of that.
LAURA: Of course! Yeah!

01:47:02.474 --> 01:47:06.167
MATT: So you mark off 250 now and pay 250 at the arrival.

01:47:06.167 --> 01:47:09.759
He went from completely exasperated by the whole thing

01:47:09.759 --> 01:47:14.684
to extremely giddy and jubilant in a way that

01:47:14.684 --> 01:47:18.307
you didn't expect such an individual to exhibit.

01:47:18.307 --> 01:47:19.497
LIAM: You just saved his business.

01:47:19.497 --> 01:47:20.638
LAURA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: There's a tailor

01:47:20.638 --> 01:47:21.721
in the back, screaming,

01:47:21.721 --> 01:47:23.900
"Nine women can't make a baby in a month!"

01:47:23.900 --> 01:47:27.392
(laughter)

01:47:31.277 --> 01:47:32.387
MATT: All right.

01:47:32.387 --> 01:47:33.287
SAM: Who's next?

01:47:33.287 --> 01:47:34.857
MATT: Anyone else?

01:47:34.857 --> 01:47:35.690
LIAM: Ladies?

01:47:35.690 --> 01:47:38.335
SAM: I would like to-- do you have something?

01:47:38.335 --> 01:47:40.227
ASHLEY: I'll come up with something, I'm sure.

01:47:40.227 --> 01:47:43.093
SAM: I would like a long-sleeve, fur Lolita dress.

01:47:43.093 --> 01:47:46.657
SAM: I would like a long-sleeve, fur Lolita dress.

01:47:46.657 --> 01:47:47.957
LAURA: Ooh!

01:47:47.957 --> 01:47:51.547
SAM: It's a Lolita coat and dress, with a bow knot

01:47:51.547 --> 01:47:54.557
in the middle and the belt line, and...

01:47:54.557 --> 01:47:55.537
I looked this up before.

01:47:55.537 --> 01:48:00.067
I want it made out of pink fabric and white fur trim

01:48:00.067 --> 01:48:04.207
on all of the trim places, big buttons down the middle.

01:48:04.207 --> 01:48:06.223
SAM: This is fucking adorable.

01:48:07.257 --> 01:48:09.457
SAM: White hand muff.

01:48:09.457 --> 01:48:12.932
And then I'd like earmuffs, too,

01:48:12.932 --> 01:48:16.207
but very special ear muffs.

01:48:16.207 --> 01:48:20.117
If you can craft them, you know, white fur earmuffs,

01:48:20.117 --> 01:48:23.067
but this piece, the headpiece or whatever,

01:48:23.067 --> 01:48:26.257
I saw this wonderful, lovely little redhead

01:48:26.257 --> 01:48:29.207
who had these cool antlers, and I'd like to

01:48:29.207 --> 01:48:31.857
imitate those and put those up on top of the ear muffs

01:48:31.857 --> 01:48:35.507
imitate those and put those up on top of the ear muffs

01:48:35.507 --> 01:48:38.557
because they just looked so cool. So I'd like that.

01:48:38.557 --> 01:48:41.857
They can just be little deer, little faun,

01:48:41.857 --> 01:48:44.560
something, you know, just little antlers.

01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:45.756
TALIESIN: I can't wait to clean blood stains out of this.

01:48:45.756 --> 01:48:48.867
MARISHA: Oh my goodness!
LIAM: Bowknot in D&amp;D.

01:48:48.867 --> 01:48:50.187
MATT: The first tailor you speak to,

01:48:50.187 --> 01:48:52.210
a middle-aged gentleman with a bit of a gray heft

01:48:52.210 --> 01:48:56.444
of fur on his chin and slicked-back hair and glasses, goes,

01:48:56.444 --> 01:48:58.134
"No, I'm sorry. I'm busy for the next week,"

01:48:58.134 --> 01:49:00.167
(slamming) and closes the door.

01:49:00.167 --> 01:49:04.877
But the next tailor you find can take the commission and

01:49:04.877 --> 01:49:07.397
puts a full cost, materials, all in,

01:49:07.397 --> 01:49:10.947
custom elements there, about 40 gold.

01:49:10.947 --> 01:49:15.070
SAM: Cool. Taking Jester's lead, I'll give you 42.

01:49:17.427 --> 01:49:20.567
MATT: "Well. How very kind."

01:49:20.567 --> 01:49:21.417
SAM: And some boots.

01:49:23.237 --> 01:49:24.070
MATT: "45."

01:49:24.070 --> 01:49:25.237
SAM: Great, done.

01:49:25.237 --> 01:49:27.197
MATT: (laughs)

01:49:27.197 --> 01:49:28.600
"All right, see you in a week."

01:49:30.757 --> 01:49:31.590
All right.

01:49:32.457 --> 01:49:33.877
TRAVIS: Who's next?

01:49:33.877 --> 01:49:34.827
SAM: You!

01:49:34.827 --> 01:49:36.677
TALIESIN: I'll go if no one else is going to go.

01:49:38.257 --> 01:49:42.147
So I'm going to find a tailor and probably a leather smith

01:49:42.147 --> 01:49:44.997
and an armor smith, and want to get my

01:49:44.997 --> 01:49:49.550
armor treated, get it oiled and treated for the cold.

01:49:50.797 --> 01:49:53.287
I leave a couple samples, I pull the pieces

01:49:53.287 --> 01:49:54.887
off the shield that are mostly decorative

01:49:54.887 --> 01:49:57.407
to show how it's done.

01:49:57.407 --> 01:49:59.297
Leave a couple of fabric swatches from what I'm already

01:49:59.297 --> 01:50:02.867
wearing. I'm going to leave some of my bits

01:50:02.867 --> 01:50:05.070
there for them to use for the new outfit.

01:50:06.137 --> 01:50:09.267
And I get a big lavender coat with

01:50:10.297 --> 01:50:15.289
white and crimson red stitching in it made.

01:50:15.289 --> 01:50:17.630
white and crimson red stitching in it made.

01:50:17.630 --> 01:50:20.630
A wool hat, it's time for a new hat.

01:50:24.218 --> 01:50:28.337
Black oiled gloves and boots.

01:50:28.337 --> 01:50:33.307
Deep moss green pants, heavy cotton pants

01:50:33.307 --> 01:50:37.477
and a jacket underneath to keep the armor

01:50:37.477 --> 01:50:40.827
off of me, just less than a shirt.

01:50:40.827 --> 01:50:44.577
And then worked into the cloak will be

01:50:44.577 --> 01:50:48.677
some of the dragonfly silk that I've brought from home,

01:50:48.677 --> 01:50:53.677
and we'll have patterns along the edges of

01:50:54.147 --> 01:50:56.717
some of the traditional patternwork of

01:50:56.717 --> 01:50:58.787
my original outfit that comes from home.

01:50:58.787 --> 01:51:00.737
MATT: Okay, cool.

01:51:00.737 --> 01:51:02.247
TALIESIN: Nicest thing I've ever owned.

01:51:02.247 --> 01:51:04.957
MATT: No, and it's not a terribly hard commission.

01:51:04.957 --> 01:51:06.667
You're also providing some of the materials for it,

01:51:06.667 --> 01:51:08.140
which would be harder to find.

01:51:09.797 --> 01:51:13.305
That'll put you at about, we'll say 25 gold as well.

01:51:13.305 --> 01:51:16.895
TALIESIN: I'll give him 20.

01:51:16.895 --> 01:51:18.697
I'll throw 40 since we're all being...

01:51:18.697 --> 01:51:21.017
MATT: Okay! Wow, you guys are...

01:51:21.017 --> 01:51:22.017
TALIESIN: It's only money.

01:51:22.017 --> 01:51:24.057
MATT: You guys are making a reputation for yourselves here

01:51:24.057 --> 01:51:26.307
in the middle of this district of Rexxentrum.

01:51:27.707 --> 01:51:29.847
All right. Who else?

01:51:29.847 --> 01:51:32.047
LAURA: Oh, you haven't gone yet, and you haven't gone yet.

01:51:32.047 --> 01:51:33.910
ASHLEY: Yeah.
TRAVIS: You want to go?

01:51:33.910 --> 01:51:35.957
ASHLEY: Well, I do have a question, so.

01:51:35.957 --> 01:51:37.107
MATT: What's your question?

01:51:38.617 --> 01:51:42.617
ASHLEY: Can I-- So, the Coat of the Crest.

01:51:42.617 --> 01:51:46.237
I was thinking of wearing the nobleman's coat.

01:51:46.237 --> 01:51:47.070
MATT: Yeah.

01:51:47.070 --> 01:51:50.507
ASHLEY: Am I able to add anything to it? Like changes,

01:51:50.507 --> 01:51:52.957
like change the look of it?

01:51:52.957 --> 01:51:53.957
MATT: Sure. Yeah.

01:51:53.957 --> 01:51:54.790
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:51:56.927 --> 01:52:01.927
So I will bring that coat and I would like to...

01:52:03.263 --> 01:52:04.797
Everything's going to be black,

01:52:06.567 --> 01:52:10.659
and I would like the sleeves to be those ones

01:52:10.659 --> 01:52:12.092
and I would like the sleeves to be those ones

01:52:12.092 --> 01:52:14.097
that are a little wide,

01:52:14.097 --> 01:52:16.030
like make the sleeves a little wider.

01:52:16.997 --> 01:52:19.147
So, you know, I can put my hands in between

01:52:19.147 --> 01:52:20.839
them if cold.

01:52:22.097 --> 01:52:26.235
A sort of leather, drapey hood added onto it

01:52:26.235 --> 01:52:30.107
with some fur inside. And then--

01:52:30.107 --> 01:52:31.707
MATT: What color fur? Black as well?

01:52:33.270 --> 01:52:37.301
ASHLEY: I really wish I would've thought about this already.

01:52:37.301 --> 01:52:38.327
Yeah.

01:52:38.327 --> 01:52:39.160
MATT: Okay.

01:52:39.160 --> 01:52:43.751
ASHLEY: Yeah, black fur, and... no, let's go white.

01:52:43.751 --> 01:52:44.797
Go white.

01:52:44.797 --> 01:52:48.577
White fur, and then in the back of the coat,

01:52:48.577 --> 01:52:51.627
I want also black embroidery on top.

01:52:51.627 --> 01:52:52.877
So you can barely see it.

01:52:54.377 --> 01:52:58.127
Like some lightning, some flowers,

01:52:58.127 --> 01:53:00.938
maybe a little white embroidery flowers.

01:53:00.938 --> 01:53:03.938
MATT: Little accents here and there.
ASHLEY: Little accents here and there.

01:53:06.597 --> 01:53:11.597
And one of those round fur hats that.

01:53:14.510 --> 01:53:15.827
SAM: Like the Russian ones?

01:53:15.827 --> 01:53:17.080
ASHLEY: Yeah.
SAM: Fuck yeah.

01:53:17.927 --> 01:53:19.477
MATT: Very cool. Okay.

01:53:19.477 --> 01:53:20.627
ASHLEY: Hopefully I don't....

01:53:23.584 --> 01:53:24.947
Yeah. Okay. Later I'm going to be like,

01:53:24.947 --> 01:53:26.597
that's not what I wanted to wear.

01:53:27.517 --> 01:53:28.775
TALIESIN: There'll be time to alter a bit.

01:53:28.775 --> 01:53:29.747
ASHLEY: Really wish I would've checked my GM.

01:53:29.747 --> 01:53:33.317
MATT: Not too complicated.
We'll put you at 18 gold for that.

01:53:33.317 --> 01:53:38.097
ASHLEY: Okay. So I will give 50 gold.

01:53:38.097 --> 01:53:40.577
MATT: Okay. Wow.
ASHLEY: Since everybody's--

01:53:40.577 --> 01:53:43.828
MATT: Big spenders here, Mighty Nein.

01:53:43.828 --> 01:53:46.177
(laughs)

01:53:46.177 --> 01:53:47.157
Generous group!

01:53:47.157 --> 01:53:49.565
LIAM: Tailor's going to party tonight.

01:53:49.565 --> 01:53:51.590
MATT: Yeah. They're going to tell tales of this

01:53:51.590 --> 01:53:54.017
phantom group that came through out of nowhere one day

01:53:54.017 --> 01:53:57.490
and just helped them make it through the winter.

01:53:59.290 --> 01:54:00.390
Fjord, anything specific?

01:54:00.390 --> 01:54:02.124
TRAVIS: Do you have any coats?

01:54:02.124 --> 01:54:03.767
(laughter)

01:54:03.767 --> 01:54:05.457
MATT: "Yeah. There are a number of coats.

01:54:05.457 --> 01:54:06.867
"What sort of coat are you looking for?"

01:54:06.867 --> 01:54:08.337
TRAVIS: A warm one.

01:54:08.337 --> 01:54:09.866
MATT: "We have a few warm ones, yes."

01:54:09.866 --> 01:54:10.797
TRAVIS: I'll take one.

01:54:10.797 --> 01:54:12.927
MATT: "All right. That'll be five gold."

01:54:12.927 --> 01:54:14.893
TRAVIS: You got it.
MATT: "All right. Here you go."

01:54:14.893 --> 01:54:17.814
TALIESIN: It's going to be like
that time we went to Colorado and

01:54:17.814 --> 01:54:21.161
you're just going to be cold
everywhere the jacket's not covering.

01:54:21.161 --> 01:54:22.482
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:54:22.482 --> 01:54:24.428
TRAVIS: We're set. Let's rock!

01:54:25.267 --> 01:54:28.325
LAURA: I run back to the tailor's that I went to.

01:54:28.325 --> 01:54:29.750
Knock on the door.

01:54:29.750 --> 01:54:30.987
Excuse me?

01:54:30.987 --> 01:54:32.567
MATT: Already in there and he's running around,

01:54:32.567 --> 01:54:34.437
giving out orders and giving out slips to different

01:54:34.437 --> 01:54:36.447
members of the troupe to start grabbing materials.

01:54:36.447 --> 01:54:37.677
"Oh, yes, yes, hello."

01:54:37.677 --> 01:54:41.620
LAURA: Can you make me some
mittens that match my socks, please?

01:54:42.847 --> 01:54:45.397
MATT: "Yes. Do not worry, no additional charge.

01:54:45.397 --> 01:54:46.790
"We'll take care of it for you."
LAURA: Thank you.

01:54:46.790 --> 01:54:48.949
MATT: "You're welcome."
LAURA: Please make them pretty, thank you.

01:54:48.949 --> 01:54:52.860
MATT: "All right, thank you. Someone lock the door."

01:54:52.860 --> 01:54:53.818
TRAVIS: Lock the door.

01:54:54.081 --> 01:54:55.591
MATT: All right.

01:54:55.591 --> 01:54:57.941
As you are finishing your research, by the way,

01:54:58.991 --> 01:55:02.551
you do close the tome, sit there,

01:55:02.551 --> 01:55:03.791
taking in a bit of the information,

01:55:03.791 --> 01:55:05.591
some of it familiar, some of it new.

01:55:06.701 --> 01:55:08.641
A little frustrated that there's just a general lack

01:55:08.641 --> 01:55:12.281
of detailed information within the central archive

01:55:12.281 --> 01:55:15.431
of Rexxentrum on Aeor,

01:55:16.406 --> 01:55:17.664
when you feel a presence come up,

01:55:17.664 --> 01:55:20.921
and there you turn and you see Yudala Fon approaching

01:55:20.921 --> 01:55:24.161
with two of the regular archivists,

01:55:24.161 --> 01:55:27.701
and as they approach and stand there over you,

01:55:27.701 --> 01:55:29.546
"Hello, Beauregard.

01:55:30.693 --> 01:55:32.241
"Do not mean to disturb you."

01:55:32.241 --> 01:55:33.074
MARISHA: No.

01:55:33.074 --> 01:55:34.511
I mean, it's a little unnerving when, like,

01:55:34.511 --> 01:55:36.689
I'm sitting and all three of you are standing.

01:55:36.689 --> 01:55:39.007
I should-- I stand.

01:55:39.901 --> 01:55:40.884
MATT: "Very well.

01:55:42.181 --> 01:55:45.471
"We've done quite an extensive sweep

01:55:45.471 --> 01:55:47.629
"of the archives we have here,

01:55:47.629 --> 01:55:50.711
"as well as put out some feelers

01:55:50.711 --> 01:55:55.253
"in other connected archives searching for this...

01:55:56.341 --> 01:55:59.574
"Eyes of Nine you had spoke of.

01:56:01.071 --> 01:56:02.129
"Nothing."

01:56:08.214 --> 01:56:09.047
MARISHA: Really?

01:56:09.047 --> 01:56:11.731
MATT: "Is there any other details you could perhaps provide?

01:56:13.721 --> 01:56:15.071
"Another name, or--?

01:56:18.621 --> 01:56:21.429
"Perhaps confirm with your sources

01:56:21.429 --> 01:56:24.212
"what this may have been,

01:56:25.561 --> 01:56:28.241
"but we do not have anything," and you watch

01:56:28.241 --> 01:56:30.841
as they put their hand out, and

01:56:30.841 --> 01:56:34.249
gesturing to the thousands and thousands

01:56:34.249 --> 01:56:35.915
and thousands of tomes.
MARISHA: Yeah, no, I see.

01:56:35.915 --> 01:56:37.531
I know, I've seen the books,

01:56:37.531 --> 01:56:39.333
I've been here, yeah, I get it.

01:56:39.333 --> 01:56:40.434
I get the scope.

01:56:42.371 --> 01:56:43.204
Yeah.

01:56:44.781 --> 01:56:45.614
Okay.

01:56:47.741 --> 01:56:48.771
Can I get back to you?

01:56:48.771 --> 01:56:50.421
Let me think on this for a minute.

01:56:50.421 --> 01:56:52.021
MATT: "Of course."

01:56:52.021 --> 01:56:53.370
MARISHA: Okay.

01:56:53.370 --> 01:56:54.821
MATT: They turn around and make their way

01:56:54.821 --> 01:56:56.134
to the rest of the library.

01:56:56.134 --> 01:56:59.518
MARISHA: Fucking irritated, just toss a book that I have.

01:56:59.518 --> 01:57:00.880
MATT: Yudala stops.

01:57:00.880 --> 01:57:03.701
MARISHA: Huh?
ASHLEY: Are they lying?

01:57:03.701 --> 01:57:04.534
MARISHA: Lying?

01:57:04.534 --> 01:57:08.625
Oh, I mean, yeah, insight check, as they walk away?

01:57:08.625 --> 01:57:09.791
(laughter)

01:57:09.791 --> 01:57:11.961
MATT: Roll an insight check.
MARISHA: It seem like they were lying?

01:57:11.961 --> 01:57:13.741
MATT: Roll an insight check.

01:57:15.231 --> 01:57:17.009
MARISHA: Oh, pooper.

01:57:17.009 --> 01:57:17.971
That's not good.

01:57:20.378 --> 01:57:21.431
15.

01:57:21.431 --> 01:57:22.264
MATT: 15.

01:57:24.218 --> 01:57:27.001
Yudala seems pretty straightforward.

01:57:27.001 --> 01:57:29.246
The times that you have encountered and what you've heard,

01:57:29.246 --> 01:57:32.619
Yudala is one of the paragons of the archives.

01:57:37.151 --> 01:57:38.961
They seem trustworthy.

01:57:38.961 --> 01:57:39.794
TALIESIN: Hmm.

01:57:42.681 --> 01:57:44.331
MARISHA: Okay, I just kind of like--

01:57:45.351 --> 01:57:47.304
Seems hard to believe, but okay.

01:57:49.531 --> 01:57:50.651
Yeah.

01:57:50.651 --> 01:57:51.484
MATT: Okay.

01:57:52.871 --> 01:57:55.061
Anything else anyone needs to accomplish

01:57:55.061 --> 01:57:58.991
in your shopping day here in Rexxentrum?

01:57:58.991 --> 01:58:02.264
LIAM: No, but when I return to Beauregard:

01:58:05.571 --> 01:58:08.091
You know, I meant to read with you.

01:58:08.091 --> 01:58:11.741
I got a little caught up in errands.

01:58:11.741 --> 01:58:12.688
MARISHA: Yeah, don't worry about it.

01:58:12.688 --> 01:58:17.241
LIAM: I'm feeling a little anxious, a little too anxious,

01:58:17.241 --> 01:58:20.354
if you can believe it, to do heavy reading.
MARISHA: You?

01:58:21.320 --> 01:58:23.531
LIAM: Today.
MARISHA: Oh, actually, that is surprising.

01:58:23.531 --> 01:58:25.511
I was being sarcastic, but that is a little surprising.

01:58:25.511 --> 01:58:26.884
LIAM: Let's go get lunch.

01:58:28.201 --> 01:58:29.541
I could listen to you.

01:58:29.541 --> 01:58:30.791
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll fill you in.

01:58:33.901 --> 01:58:36.751
I just rip a page out of my notebook in anger.

01:58:36.751 --> 01:58:38.651
MATT: Okay. (chuckles)

01:58:38.651 --> 01:58:40.468
LIAM: You need beer and a pretzel, come on.

01:58:40.468 --> 01:58:41.888
MARISHA: Okay.

01:58:41.888 --> 01:58:43.586
MATT: All right. So you guys go ahead and find the--

01:58:43.586 --> 01:58:45.801
LIAM: Find a place, sit at an outside table,

01:58:45.801 --> 01:58:50.358
and then if she's willing to share, pump her mind

01:58:50.358 --> 01:58:52.101
for all the information she got

01:58:52.101 --> 01:58:54.401
and totally nerd out over it.

01:58:54.401 --> 01:58:56.331
MATT: You got it.
LIAM: Rather than trying to focus on a book,

01:58:56.331 --> 01:58:58.631
which I would have a hard time doing right now.

01:58:58.631 --> 01:58:59.881
MATT: Okay.

01:58:59.881 --> 01:59:00.714
All right.

01:59:01.888 --> 01:59:02.721
Anything else?

01:59:02.721 --> 01:59:03.838
MARISHA: I tell him everything.

01:59:03.838 --> 01:59:06.343
And then also I'd fill him in about

01:59:06.343 --> 01:59:08.761
Yudala came back, and they said

01:59:08.761 --> 01:59:11.719
that they couldn't find anything about the Eyes of Nine.

01:59:11.719 --> 01:59:13.427
Fucking anything!

01:59:14.731 --> 01:59:16.581
They were like, "Oh, do you, like--

01:59:16.581 --> 01:59:18.791
"can you check with your sources

01:59:18.791 --> 01:59:21.424
"and maybe find--" I'm like, bitch, I'm the source.

01:59:21.424 --> 01:59:23.715
I didn't say that, but I did think it in my head.

01:59:25.520 --> 01:59:28.002
LIAM: That thing you think as
you walk down the stairs, <i>ja</i>?

01:59:30.403 --> 01:59:34.866
Well, maybe it was...

01:59:34.866 --> 01:59:39.009
just smoke and not fire.

01:59:39.009 --> 01:59:40.224
Maybe it was--

01:59:41.851 --> 01:59:44.414
Maybe we're seeing meaning where there is none,

01:59:45.301 --> 01:59:47.971
or maybe it is the key to everything, I don't know.

01:59:51.753 --> 01:59:52.645
Think about it.

01:59:52.645 --> 01:59:53.704
MARISHA: Keep your ears open.

01:59:53.704 --> 01:59:55.251
Just need more answers.

01:59:55.251 --> 01:59:57.071
LIAM: We can come back later in the week, yeah?

01:59:57.071 --> 01:59:58.387
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.
LIAM: Keep thinking.

01:59:58.387 --> 01:59:59.220
MARISHA: Okay.

02:00:02.121 --> 02:00:03.281
MATT: All right.

02:00:03.281 --> 02:00:04.904
Any other business during the day?

02:00:07.771 --> 02:00:08.604
All right.

02:00:08.604 --> 02:00:12.161
I'll take that as a sign that as the sun begins to set

02:00:12.161 --> 02:00:17.161
across the Zemnian sky, you all gather...

02:00:17.678 --> 02:00:20.381
wearing what attire?

02:00:20.381 --> 02:00:22.241
SAM: We brought our fancies.
LAURA: Our fancy.

02:00:22.241 --> 02:00:24.006
MATT: So you're going full formal on this, okay.

02:00:24.006 --> 02:00:25.152
SAM: Yeah, yeah.

02:00:25.152 --> 02:00:27.531
ASHLEY: Oh, the fancies that we wore to--

02:00:27.531 --> 02:00:29.227
LIAM: The ball.
SAM: The ball.

02:00:29.227 --> 02:00:30.531
ASHLEY: Oh, that's right. That velvet dress.

02:00:30.531 --> 02:00:32.901
LAURA: Yeah, but, like, a little bit of armor still.

02:00:32.901 --> 02:00:34.759
MARISHA: Yeah, I keep on my bracers--
LAURA: Just in casies.

02:00:34.759 --> 02:00:36.182
MARISHA: -- and I bring my staff.

02:00:36.182 --> 02:00:37.771
MATT: Okay.

02:00:37.771 --> 02:00:38.614
All right.

02:00:40.131 --> 02:00:42.851
Gathering and making your way to the familiar Shimmer Ward

02:00:42.851 --> 02:00:47.851
of Rexxentrum, as the darkened sky

02:00:48.191 --> 02:00:51.411
takes the horizon from the sunlight,

02:00:51.411 --> 02:00:54.111
and you can see from the breaks in the cloud cover

02:00:54.111 --> 02:00:56.034
bits of starlight peeking through,

02:00:57.081 --> 02:01:01.214
you eventually make your way to a familiar place to you.

02:01:03.031 --> 02:01:06.731
You come to the second southernmost tower of the Candles

02:01:06.731 --> 02:01:10.494
on the southern-eastern side of the Shimmer Ward.

02:01:11.631 --> 02:01:14.211
And you stand now before the dark iron gate

02:01:14.211 --> 02:01:17.121
that is dwarfed by the multi-spired structure

02:01:17.121 --> 02:01:20.081
of brass and ruddy brick that rises

02:01:20.081 --> 02:01:21.861
like a twisting monolithic tree

02:01:21.861 --> 02:01:24.321
from a courtyard dense with oaks.

02:01:25.221 --> 02:01:28.021
This is the estate grounds known as the Ambition's Call.

02:01:29.521 --> 02:01:34.274
And the gates open for you as you stand there.

02:01:36.091 --> 02:01:36.931
That's where we're going to take a break.

02:01:36.931 --> 02:01:39.073
TRAVIS: Ooh.
MARISHA: (laughs)

02:01:39.073 --> 02:01:40.146
TRAVIS: Ambition's Call?

02:01:40.146 --> 02:01:41.725
MATT: Ambition's Call.

02:01:41.725 --> 02:01:44.204
SAM: Number four Privet Drive.

02:01:46.071 --> 02:01:48.551
LAURA: It's a tower?
TRAVIS: Lord of the Rings reference.

02:01:48.551 --> 02:01:50.031
LAURA: Out of the oak trees?
MATT: Correct.

02:01:50.031 --> 02:01:51.841
There's a courtyard of oak trees.

02:01:51.841 --> 02:01:53.981
On the corner of this, on the opposite end,

02:01:53.981 --> 02:01:57.161
there is an entrance that leads to where Astrid was staying,

02:01:57.161 --> 02:01:59.451
where you went and visited last time

02:01:59.451 --> 02:02:01.101
you were here in Rexxentrum.

02:02:03.238 --> 02:02:04.071
But yes.

02:02:05.256 --> 02:02:06.106
So.

02:02:06.106 --> 02:02:07.819
SAM: Dinner.
MATT: Indeed.

02:02:07.819 --> 02:02:08.869
We're going to take a little break here.

02:02:08.869 --> 02:02:12.001
We'll be back here shortly to pick up wherever this goes.

02:02:12.001 --> 02:02:14.254
So see you here in a few minutes.

02:02:15.100 --> 02:02:18.001
Now experience the ultimate way to play,

02:02:18.001 --> 02:02:20.507
by sitting at a table with your friends,

02:02:20.507 --> 02:02:23.257
with your face in a screen

02:02:23.257 --> 02:02:24.009
Progress!

02:02:24.009 --> 02:02:26.259
D&amp;D Beyond

02:02:26.259 --> 02:02:30.267
Log in to explore strange worlds
and fantastial cities

02:02:30.267 --> 02:02:33.016
thanks to a company based in a
really boring one.

02:02:33.016 --> 02:02:36.269
that handles all the tedious
math and reference stuff for you

02:02:36.269 --> 02:02:41.524
so you can finally unleash the epic quest you've
been crafting since middle school on your friends.

02:02:41.524 --> 02:02:44.028
Or just do what
most people use it for

02:02:44.028 --> 02:02:46.782
breaking out endless new
characters while their bored at work

02:02:46.782 --> 02:02:52.791
I could just finish these spreadsheets,
but what if this Paladin owned a horse?

02:02:52.791 --> 02:02:54.789
Perfect!

02:02:55.041 --> 02:02:57.041
D&amp;D Beyond
Play with advantage.

02:02:59.545 --> 02:03:05.542
Hey Critters! Laura Bailey here!
Let's see what's up in the Critical Role shop!

02:03:06.043 --> 02:03:10.545
Ooh! Look at this!
Look at the details! Ooh!

02:03:12.792 --> 02:03:15.559
It's so cute, I can't handle it.

02:03:17.058 --> 02:03:19.557
You're only like 5 clicks
away from owning this

02:03:19.557 --> 02:03:22.361
Maybe more, if you have
a lot of windows open

02:03:22.385 --> 02:03:24.570
on your browser.  I
don't know your life.

02:03:25.567 --> 02:03:32.572
Darling, I recommend buying two.  One for
you and another for you.  Let's be honest.

02:03:35.073 --> 02:03:40.081
This is a lot of stuff you guys.  We
have like so many cool things right now!

02:03:41.581 --> 02:03:47.993
All of this and more now
available in the Critical Role Shop!

02:03:49.088 --> 02:03:51.849
Brian: Hey gang!
Laura: Hey

02:03:55.598 --> 02:03:56.602
Brian: I recently went through a move,
[Laugh] very recently.

02:03:56.602 --> 02:03:59.102
Dani: To a new car?
Brian: Yeah from one car to another.

02:03:59.102 --> 02:04:08.105
I went from a '96 baby blue Ford Bronco....

02:04:08.105 --> 02:04:15.105
to a '97 baby blue
Laura: Ford Bronco

02:04:15.105 --> 02:04:18.855
Brian: What's the Chevy version of the Bronco?
[Laughter]

02:04:18.855 --> 02:04:21.799
Dani: Fell apart right
before the finish line.

02:04:20.605 --> 02:04:27.133
Brian: What's the Chevy version of the Bronco?
Where's my fiance knows more about cars than I do?

02:04:27.133 --> 02:04:28.387
Laura: I don't know

02:04:28.387 --> 02:04:29.387
Matt: That was very sad, continue.

02:04:29.387 --> 02:04:32.385
Laura: That was a sad moment,
I'm glad we all witnessed it.

02:04:40.647 --> 02:04:45.131
(upbeat jazz music)

02:04:45.131 --> 02:04:46.551
MARISHA: Hello everyone.

02:04:46.551 --> 02:04:48.921 line:20%
It's me, Marisha Ray,

02:04:48.921 --> 02:04:51.731 line:20%
Creative Director for Critical Role content.

02:04:51.731 --> 02:04:53.811 line:20%
And I want to take a moment to speak from the heart

02:04:53.811 --> 02:04:56.921 line:20%
about how much we appreciate your support.

02:04:56.921 --> 02:05:01.187
No frills, no crazy gags, just honesty.

02:05:01.187 --> 02:05:02.395
Over the past five years,

02:05:02.395 --> 02:05:05.121
we've made a lot of ridiculous promos

02:05:05.121 --> 02:05:08.512
in an attempt to earn your subscription here on Twitch.

02:05:08.512 --> 02:05:12.081
We've leaned on juvenile prop humor, cheap costumes,

02:05:12.081 --> 02:05:14.206
and putting our loyal employees

02:05:14.206 --> 02:05:17.160
in slightly embarrassing situations eagerly hoping

02:05:17.160 --> 02:05:19.611
that we've captured your attention.

02:05:19.611 --> 02:05:23.141
Today, I am not resorting to edgelord jokes

02:05:23.141 --> 02:05:25.493
written by Brian W. Foster.

02:05:25.493 --> 02:05:28.348
Or dressing Sam as a celebrity to recreate

02:05:28.348 --> 02:05:31.399
an obscure commercial most people haven't seen

02:05:31.399 --> 02:05:34.571
to remind you that subscribing with a Twitch Prime account

02:05:34.571 --> 02:05:37.022
requires you to re-subscribe each month.

02:05:37.022 --> 02:05:40.731
We don't always need an elaborate green screen gag

02:05:40.731 --> 02:05:42.791
or have to put Matt in cosplay

02:05:42.791 --> 02:05:45.372
to tell you that you can easily give subscriptions

02:05:45.372 --> 02:05:48.041
to fellow critters if you're feeling generous.

02:05:48.041 --> 02:05:51.670
I mean, hell, I've consumed entire production days

02:05:51.670 --> 02:05:55.391
shooting complicated parody promos featuring Taliesin Jaffe

02:05:55.391 --> 02:05:59.291
as a vintage spooky boy in full monochromatic glory

02:05:59.291 --> 02:06:04.271
all in the hope that your smile may turn into a sub.

02:06:04.271 --> 02:06:06.421
But not today.

02:06:06.421 --> 02:06:08.411 line:20%
No weird graphics.

02:06:08.411 --> 02:06:10.048 line:20%
No puppet murder.

02:06:11.131 --> 02:06:12.696
No Sam Riegel.

02:06:16.101 --> 02:06:18.181
It's just me,

02:06:18.181 --> 02:06:19.339
here to say:

02:06:20.241 --> 02:06:21.416
thank you.

02:06:22.261 --> 02:06:23.344
Love you all.

02:06:24.761 --> 02:06:26.735
Good night. (kiss)

02:06:26.735 --> 02:06:29.435
(upbeat jazz music)

02:18:41.300 --> 02:18:42.153
MATT: Welcome back.

02:18:43.010 --> 02:18:48.010
So. The gates (creaking)

02:18:48.020 --> 02:18:49.203
open before you.

02:18:50.470 --> 02:18:52.473
The courtyard, leading to the tower.

02:18:54.750 --> 02:18:57.810
As you walk through, it's a beautiful,

02:18:57.810 --> 02:19:02.050
if slightly ominous, patch of forest surrounding this tower.

02:19:02.050 --> 02:19:05.250
You can see faint fire bugs glowing

02:19:05.250 --> 02:19:06.950
and fading in and out in the distance,

02:19:06.950 --> 02:19:10.380
but just far enough out of reach,

02:19:10.380 --> 02:19:12.833
as you walk this paved path that leads through.

02:19:15.160 --> 02:19:17.870
Eventually, you find yourself to the base of the tower

02:19:17.870 --> 02:19:21.450
where this massive set of arched double doors

02:19:21.450 --> 02:19:25.713
that wait for you open into a low-lit antechamber.

02:19:29.564 --> 02:19:34.150
As you walk into the tower chamber proper,

02:19:34.150 --> 02:19:38.600
you are met with a patterned carpet of dark brown and red

02:19:38.600 --> 02:19:40.550
that meets wall to wall.

02:19:40.550 --> 02:19:43.991
No furniture, just an open entry.

02:19:45.990 --> 02:19:47.510
You can see a beautiful crystal chandelier

02:19:47.510 --> 02:19:49.100
that hangs above you in the center

02:19:49.100 --> 02:19:51.540
of the partially domed ceiling.

02:19:51.540 --> 02:19:53.910
You can see intricately carved wooden panels

02:19:53.910 --> 02:19:57.880
wrap around the doorless walls, aside from the entryway,

02:19:57.880 --> 02:20:01.881
housing large paintings set within elaborate frames.

02:20:01.881 --> 02:20:05.750
You can see one large landscape that shows an odd sunrise,

02:20:05.750 --> 02:20:09.750
it seems, over a desolate plain of rock and flame,

02:20:09.750 --> 02:20:12.653
a sky of burning clouds and haze.

02:20:13.650 --> 02:20:16.483
Anyone here who is trained in arcana, if you'd like to roll?

02:20:20.650 --> 02:20:22.700
LIAM: 15.
MATT: 15?

02:20:22.700 --> 02:20:24.580
That's enough to know this is most likely

02:20:24.580 --> 02:20:27.263
a portrait of the Plane of Fire.

02:20:29.020 --> 02:20:31.630
You do also see a bloodied battlefield,

02:20:31.630 --> 02:20:35.540
a very elaborate, extensive, wide, 12-foot portrait

02:20:35.540 --> 02:20:38.720
that is curved in the way it's set

02:20:38.720 --> 02:20:40.800
against the curved interior of this chamber,

02:20:40.800 --> 02:20:43.590
where you see soldiers of two sides

02:20:43.590 --> 02:20:48.323
just clashing and tangling, in this display of violence.

02:20:49.400 --> 02:20:52.470
If anyone here has History they're proficient with,

02:20:52.470 --> 02:20:54.270
they can go ahead and roll for that.

02:20:58.920 --> 02:20:59.940
MARISHA: 31.

02:20:59.940 --> 02:21:01.506
SAM: Ooh! Damn.
LAURA: Whoa!

02:21:01.506 --> 02:21:02.664
ASHLEY: Jeez Louise.

02:21:04.090 --> 02:21:06.720
MATT: This is a depiction of the Marrow War,

02:21:06.720 --> 02:21:08.640
which was the battle--
SAM: Marijuana?

02:21:08.640 --> 02:21:12.230
MATT: The Marrow War, where the Dwendalian Empire

02:21:12.230 --> 02:21:14.026
clashed with the Julous Dominion,

02:21:14.026 --> 02:21:18.190
defeated, and then took over the entirety of this area

02:21:18.190 --> 02:21:20.573
of Western Wynandir, this great valley here.

02:21:23.180 --> 02:21:24.013
Well done.

02:21:24.920 --> 02:21:27.170
And you come across a portrait

02:21:27.170 --> 02:21:31.000
of a young man in a forest green, gold-trimmed robe

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:32.300
on display.

02:21:32.300 --> 02:21:35.160
You see his long dark hair comes to a widow's peak

02:21:35.160 --> 02:21:38.263
to the front of his face, right over his gray-blue eyes.

02:21:39.150 --> 02:21:41.000
You take a moment to recognize,

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:45.250
but this image does appear to be of a young Trent Ikithon.

02:21:47.400 --> 02:21:51.560
Not but a moment later do you make this beat of recognition

02:21:51.560 --> 02:21:53.462
then you swear you see the man in the painting

02:21:53.462 --> 02:21:54.550
give you a subtle nod.

02:21:57.100 --> 02:22:00.400
TRAVIS: Can I use See Invisibility for the next hour?

02:22:00.400 --> 02:22:02.266
Just because fuck it, why not?

02:22:02.266 --> 02:22:03.099
MATT: Sure.

02:22:04.110 --> 02:22:08.719
You put it on right as the doors close behind you.

02:22:09.730 --> 02:22:11.190
You're now enclosed in this chamber.

02:22:11.190 --> 02:22:12.720
There are no stairs.

02:22:12.720 --> 02:22:14.840
There's no other exit door.

02:22:14.840 --> 02:22:18.370
LAURA: Can I look towards the bottoms

02:22:18.370 --> 02:22:19.953
or anything of the paintings?

02:22:19.953 --> 02:22:22.030
I want to see if they have any signatures on them

02:22:22.030 --> 02:22:24.240
of painters that I would recognize,

02:22:24.240 --> 02:22:25.680
some of them that I studied.

02:22:25.680 --> 02:22:26.980
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:22:28.880 --> 02:22:29.843
LAURA: Guidance.

02:22:33.480 --> 02:22:35.943
Cool. (laughs, blows raspberry)

02:22:40.917 --> 02:22:42.409
Nine.

02:22:42.409 --> 02:22:43.380
TRAVIS: <i>Nein</i>?

02:22:43.380 --> 02:22:44.620
MATT: They're very detailed.

02:22:44.620 --> 02:22:46.710
It's hard to pick out where a signature would be.

02:22:46.710 --> 02:22:47.770
If there is one, if it's hidden,

02:22:47.770 --> 02:22:51.240
if it's folded within the actual gold framing,

02:22:51.240 --> 02:22:52.480
or you're just not picking up on it,

02:22:52.480 --> 02:22:53.977
but nothing jumps out to you, unfortunately.

02:22:53.977 --> 02:22:56.060
LAURA: As I get back to the Trent painting,

02:22:57.340 --> 02:23:00.180
I'm going to touch his face.

02:23:00.180 --> 02:23:01.013
MATT: Okay.

02:23:02.310 --> 02:23:05.613
You can feel the texture of canvas beneath your finger.

02:23:06.750 --> 02:23:10.160
Not but a handful of moments since the front doors closed,

02:23:10.160 --> 02:23:13.870
and at this moment, the rest of you feel

02:23:13.870 --> 02:23:16.830
this shift, and you look at the carpet

02:23:16.830 --> 02:23:20.460
in the center of the room, and there is a forceful glow

02:23:20.460 --> 02:23:22.063
from underneath in places.

02:23:24.250 --> 02:23:28.490
And you see this faint pattern

02:23:28.490 --> 02:23:32.520
of various glyphs that are gently muted by the presence

02:23:32.520 --> 02:23:35.590
of the carpet over whatever the source is,

02:23:35.590 --> 02:23:38.850
light up in a circular pattern around the interior

02:23:38.850 --> 02:23:40.116
of the chamber.

02:23:42.440 --> 02:23:47.440
You then watch as the paintings begin to drift downward.

02:23:47.813 --> 02:23:48.680
TRAVIS: Dope.

02:23:48.680 --> 02:23:51.256
TALIESIN: Is this haunted room actually--

02:23:51.256 --> 02:23:52.837
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: (laughs)

02:23:52.837 --> 02:23:53.778
This is not stretching.

02:23:53.778 --> 02:23:56.110
TALIESIN: Damn. My imagination.

02:23:56.110 --> 02:23:58.570
MATT: But it begins to rise rapidly.

02:23:58.570 --> 02:24:01.010
You watch as a door goes (whoosh),

02:24:01.010 --> 02:24:02.247
another door goes (whooshing).

02:24:03.600 --> 02:24:06.330
Floor after floor goes by.

02:24:06.330 --> 02:24:08.620
Four, five floors, you lose count

02:24:08.620 --> 02:24:10.338
as they go (rapid whooshing).

02:24:10.338 --> 02:24:12.870
Then it quickly drifts to a stop to the point

02:24:12.870 --> 02:24:15.116
where you all find your feet lift off the ground

02:24:15.116 --> 02:24:17.160
for just a second and you find yourself clambering

02:24:17.160 --> 02:24:19.110
just to make sure you don't tumble over

02:24:20.380 --> 02:24:21.857
when the floor comes to a stop.

02:24:21.857 --> 02:24:23.440
LAURA: So it felt like we were going down?

02:24:23.440 --> 02:24:24.700
MATT: Felt like you you're going upward.

02:24:24.700 --> 02:24:25.900
LAURA: So wouldn't we have--

02:24:28.663 --> 02:24:30.300
We stop?
TRAVIS: You go (whoosh).

02:24:30.300 --> 02:24:33.160
LAURA: You go up when you're going down, you go huh!

02:24:33.160 --> 02:24:34.610
MATT: Yeah.
LAURA: Okay.

02:24:35.717 --> 02:24:36.550
MATT: Physics!

02:24:38.877 --> 02:24:40.520
SAM: It's been a while since we've been in an elevator.

02:24:40.520 --> 02:24:41.888
LAURA: Been anywhere.

02:24:41.888 --> 02:24:43.733
MATT: Yeah, it's true. It's very true.

02:24:43.733 --> 02:24:46.657
TRAVIS: That's right, you jump up. Whoa!
TALIESIN: How does up and down work?

02:24:46.657 --> 02:24:47.782
LAURA: Yeah, okay, cool.

02:24:47.782 --> 02:24:49.860
Then I jump at the top.
MATT: Okay.

02:24:49.860 --> 02:24:51.663
You get a good extra foot, foot and a half

02:24:51.663 --> 02:24:53.750
of leap in the air.
TALIESIN: High five.

02:24:53.750 --> 02:24:56.520
MATT: You can almost touch the bottom of the chandelier,

02:24:56.520 --> 02:24:59.050
the chandelier that does not shake or move with the momentum

02:24:59.050 --> 02:25:01.409
of the chamber.
SAM: Ooh.

02:25:01.409 --> 02:25:03.134
MATT: As it stops and lands, you look around you.

02:25:03.134 --> 02:25:06.276
You've seen no windows at all in your progression,

02:25:06.276 --> 02:25:07.589
but you do see--

02:25:07.589 --> 02:25:09.822
MARISHA and MATT: No windows and no doors.

02:25:09.822 --> 02:25:11.681
MATT: There is actually a door to the other chamber.

02:25:11.681 --> 02:25:12.514
MARISHA: Aww.
TALIESIN: Don't worry.

02:25:12.514 --> 02:25:14.330
(laughter)

02:25:14.330 --> 02:25:17.314
MATT: You see a birchwood door
on the opposite side of the room

02:25:17.314 --> 02:25:19.260
from where the entranceway would've been

02:25:19.260 --> 02:25:20.690
at the bottom of the tower.

02:25:20.690 --> 02:25:22.570
LAURA: Do you think this happened
because I touched his face?

02:25:22.570 --> 02:25:23.940
Do you think it took us to him?

02:25:23.940 --> 02:25:25.280
Like, what if I would have touched

02:25:25.280 --> 02:25:27.240
the Fire Plane picture or something?

02:25:27.240 --> 02:25:28.223
SAM: We would've gone somewhere else.

02:25:28.223 --> 02:25:29.300
We would have gone down.

02:25:29.300 --> 02:25:31.500
LIAM: Go down, hell goes down, you go down to hell.

02:25:31.500 --> 02:25:32.790
LAURA: Wow.

02:25:32.790 --> 02:25:34.650
Glad I touched him, then.
SAM: Yeah.

02:25:34.650 --> 02:25:35.510
Always touch him.

02:25:35.510 --> 02:25:39.573
MATT: The birchwood door (creaking) opens,

02:25:39.573 --> 02:25:42.500
and you can see a little bit of flickering light

02:25:42.500 --> 02:25:44.781
on the inside of the chamber beyond.

02:25:44.781 --> 02:25:48.218
TRAVIS: Any Unseen Servants, any
spheres in the air or anything?

02:25:48.218 --> 02:25:49.650
MATT: In this room?

02:25:49.650 --> 02:25:51.200
No.

02:25:51.200 --> 02:25:53.722
As you, if you-- do you approach?
LIAM: I start to walk in.

02:25:53.722 --> 02:25:56.170
LAURA: Wait, wait, Caleb.

02:25:56.170 --> 02:25:57.820
LIAM: I stop in the door.

02:25:57.820 --> 02:25:59.340
LAURA: Wait.

02:25:59.340 --> 02:26:01.753
Shouldn't we have had a code word or something?

02:26:03.710 --> 02:26:07.190
TRAVIS: Let's discuss it now, while we're in earshot.

02:26:07.190 --> 02:26:09.230
TALIESIN: How about "Oh no, it's a trap"?

02:26:09.230 --> 02:26:10.880
LAURA: Okay. That sounds good.

02:26:10.880 --> 02:26:11.713
SAM: Great.

02:26:13.370 --> 02:26:15.682
LIAM: The code word is Yahtzee.

02:26:15.682 --> 02:26:20.283
(laughter)

02:26:20.283 --> 02:26:22.311
SAM: Pick a non-copywritten--

02:26:22.311 --> 02:26:24.773
(laughter)

02:26:24.773 --> 02:26:26.875
MARISHA: I don't know, Solitaire.
SAM: Pinochle or something?

02:26:26.875 --> 02:26:28.114
LIAM: No--
MARISHA: Old Maid.

02:26:28.114 --> 02:26:32.090
LIAM: -- it's the theater union, IATSE, Yahtzee.

02:26:32.090 --> 02:26:34.000
ASHLEY: IATSE.
MARISHA: Hmm.

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:35.809
LIAM: That's also problematic.

02:26:35.809 --> 02:26:38.860
(laughter)

02:26:38.860 --> 02:26:40.551
MATT: Damn it, Liam.
SAM: Teamsters!

02:26:41.899 --> 02:26:44.405
TRAVIS: Don't fuck with the teamsters.

02:26:44.405 --> 02:26:45.238
MATT: Okay.

02:26:47.050 --> 02:26:51.162
You can hear very, very gentle violin and harpsichord music

02:26:51.162 --> 02:26:52.195
You can hear very, very gentle violin and harpsichord music

02:26:52.195 --> 02:26:54.108
playing from inside the next room.

02:26:54.950 --> 02:26:57.950
As you begin to approach, you peek beyond the threshold,

02:26:57.950 --> 02:27:01.300
and you can see, giving off a very faint aura,

02:27:01.300 --> 02:27:06.300
six different humanoid-ish figures

02:27:06.310 --> 02:27:08.220
that stand at the ready

02:27:08.220 --> 02:27:12.771
against two walls of a long, hall-like room.

02:27:14.840 --> 02:27:18.910
As you step through the door, they all disappear,

02:27:18.910 --> 02:27:23.370
and you feel the enchantment that your weapon

02:27:23.370 --> 02:27:25.423
had given to you fade.

02:27:26.564 --> 02:27:27.397
TRAVIS: Uh-oh.

02:27:29.270 --> 02:27:30.990
MATT: As you all step through, you can see now

02:27:30.990 --> 02:27:35.990
there are a number of smaller, more metallic

02:27:36.330 --> 02:27:38.940
iron chandeliers, about four of them,

02:27:38.940 --> 02:27:43.360
that align the ceiling of this long, hall-like room

02:27:43.360 --> 02:27:47.040
where you can see a long table sits before you

02:27:47.040 --> 02:27:50.640
with these kind of

02:27:50.640 --> 02:27:55.530
pale, tan, beige-colored tablecloths,

02:27:55.530 --> 02:27:59.535
and settings and chairs for seven guests.

02:28:01.560 --> 02:28:04.630
There are windows in this room, and they appear

02:28:04.630 --> 02:28:06.890
to be somewhat frosted, but you can see beyond them

02:28:06.890 --> 02:28:11.141
what looks to be a beautiful forest.

02:28:12.790 --> 02:28:15.080
Dense in trees, a bit of moonlight

02:28:15.080 --> 02:28:17.565
coming through the branches.

02:28:17.565 --> 02:28:21.970
It doesn't quite match with the math of where you are

02:28:21.970 --> 02:28:23.370
with the center of the city.

02:28:24.820 --> 02:28:27.290
Beyond the end of this table,

02:28:27.290 --> 02:28:29.390
you can see there is a roaring fireplace

02:28:29.390 --> 02:28:31.040
on the opposite side of the room,

02:28:32.370 --> 02:28:34.300
and there framed in the flickering flames

02:28:34.300 --> 02:28:36.123
you can see three figures standing,

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:39.483
as they all turn.

02:28:41.850 --> 02:28:43.491
You can see

02:28:45.250 --> 02:28:48.291
the figure familiar to you all first

02:28:48.291 --> 02:28:52.533
is the wide-shouldered, short dark hair,

02:28:55.097 --> 02:28:57.220
well-buttoned velvet tunic

02:28:57.220 --> 02:29:01.250
on Eadwulf, who had met you once at

02:29:01.250 --> 02:29:03.220
the Vergesson Sanatorium, when you were inspecting

02:29:03.220 --> 02:29:06.021
the beacon a number of weeks back.

02:29:07.530 --> 02:29:10.590
On the right side, you can see a woman

02:29:10.590 --> 02:29:15.313
with dirty blonde hair, short in the back,

02:29:16.390 --> 02:29:18.443
combed over to one side of the face,

02:29:20.930 --> 02:29:25.514
smiling in a very, very officious looking suit,

02:29:25.514 --> 02:29:26.347
smiling in a very, very officious looking suit,

02:29:26.347 --> 02:29:29.923
it seems that comes into a

02:29:29.923 --> 02:29:33.553
long dress at the bottom.

02:29:33.553 --> 02:29:37.611
And in the center you see a...

02:29:39.410 --> 02:29:44.068
not quite the same, but mirrored essence

02:29:44.068 --> 02:29:45.960
of that same green and gold robe

02:29:45.960 --> 02:29:47.710
that you saw in the portrait below.

02:29:48.810 --> 02:29:53.810
You see the older, jaundiced figure

02:29:54.150 --> 02:29:56.443
of Master Trent Ikithon.

02:29:57.461 --> 02:30:00.663
Who smiles, puts his arms up.

02:30:02.180 --> 02:30:07.159
"I'm so very happy that you've accepted my invitation.

02:30:07.159 --> 02:30:08.840
"I'm so very happy that you've accepted my invitation.

02:30:08.840 --> 02:30:10.506
"Please sit.

02:30:12.110 --> 02:30:14.252
"I believe we have much to talk about."

02:30:17.180 --> 02:30:19.890
MARISHA: Question, you said there were only place settings

02:30:19.890 --> 02:30:21.600
for seven people?

02:30:21.600 --> 02:30:24.350
MATT: For the seven of you at the table.

02:30:24.350 --> 02:30:25.183
MARISHA: As well as--

02:30:25.183 --> 02:30:27.044
MATT: As well as the three for them.

02:30:27.044 --> 02:30:28.786
LAURA: Do we have assigned seating?

02:30:30.050 --> 02:30:33.231
MATT: There does not appear to be any sort of indication

02:30:33.231 --> 02:30:34.595
of assigned seating.

02:30:35.442 --> 02:30:37.870
SAM: Are you going to take the head of the table?

02:30:37.870 --> 02:30:39.080
LAURA: Yeah.

02:30:39.080 --> 02:30:41.524
MATT: Okay, Jester takes the opposite head of the table.

02:30:41.524 --> 02:30:42.570
(laughter)

02:30:42.570 --> 02:30:45.060
Of which Trent takes the furthest side.

02:30:45.060 --> 02:30:46.270
TRAVIS: The corners of the room where there were

02:30:46.270 --> 02:30:48.180
those six humanoid figures.

02:30:48.180 --> 02:30:49.350
Nothing there, right?

02:30:49.350 --> 02:30:50.183
MATT: Correct.
TRAVIS: Empty.

02:30:50.183 --> 02:30:51.074
MATT: Yeah.

02:30:51.074 --> 02:30:52.360
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:30:52.360 --> 02:30:57.100
LIAM: I'll wait until Astrid sits and then

02:30:57.100 --> 02:30:58.938
sit in a chair adjacent.

02:31:00.220 --> 02:31:02.580
MATT: So that would be-- at the opposite head of the table,

02:31:02.580 --> 02:31:06.430
Trent, to the left of Trent is Astrid,

02:31:06.430 --> 02:31:08.060
and then it would be you.
LIAM: Yeah.

02:31:08.060 --> 02:31:09.002
MATT: Okay.

02:31:09.002 --> 02:31:11.920
TALIESIN: I'm going to sit across
from you, wherever you sit.

02:31:11.920 --> 02:31:13.960
LAURA: Somebody should sit next to them

02:31:13.960 --> 02:31:16.640
so the Eadwulf gets separated.

02:31:16.640 --> 02:31:18.556
ASHLEY: Ooh, that's a good idea.

02:31:20.210 --> 02:31:23.000
SAM: I use my speed to try to sit

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.887
where Eadwulf would be seated.

02:31:25.887 --> 02:31:30.872
MATT: He is moving for the chair
to the right of Trent Ikithon.

02:31:32.400 --> 02:31:34.400
TRAVIS: Come on, roll for that shit.
MARISHA: Do it.

02:31:37.270 --> 02:31:39.371
LIAM: Yahtzee.

02:31:39.371 --> 02:31:40.204
TRAVIS: He has to roll dexterity?

02:31:40.204 --> 02:31:41.899
MATT: Roll a dexterity check, because this is--

02:31:41.899 --> 02:31:42.840
SAM: I don't even have my dice out.

02:31:42.840 --> 02:31:45.540
LAURA: It's like-- he's just pulling out the seat for me.

02:31:45.540 --> 02:31:46.900
TRAVIS: What do you mean you don't have your dice out?

02:31:46.900 --> 02:31:48.250
We're going to die any second!

02:31:49.340 --> 02:31:50.900
SAM: What is it am I checking?

02:31:50.900 --> 02:31:52.530
MATT: Just roll a d20, add your dexterity modifier.

02:31:52.530 --> 02:31:53.470
SAM: 17.

02:31:53.470 --> 02:31:54.520
MATT: 17.

02:31:55.860 --> 02:31:59.620
You watch this as he goes and pulls the chair out

02:31:59.620 --> 02:32:03.022
and is about to lean in and (sh-boof).

02:32:05.516 --> 02:32:06.837
SAM: Is this seat taken?

02:32:06.837 --> 02:32:08.338
MATT: (as Eadwulf) "Apparently it is."

02:32:08.338 --> 02:32:10.070
LAURA: (chuckles)
MATT: (creaking sound)

02:32:10.070 --> 02:32:12.596
And shoves you into the table a little bit.

02:32:12.596 --> 02:32:15.350
(laughter)

02:32:15.350 --> 02:32:19.128
MATT: Pulls the chair right next
to you back, and then sits down.

02:32:20.090 --> 02:32:21.610
ASHLEY: I'll sit down.

02:32:21.610 --> 02:32:23.068
MATT: In the chair that he pulls back?

02:32:23.068 --> 02:32:25.977
(laughter)

02:32:25.977 --> 02:32:28.021
TALIESIN: Power move!
ASHLEY: Thank you very much.

02:32:28.021 --> 02:32:29.350
MARISHA: Yes!

02:32:29.350 --> 02:32:30.491
MATT: "Of course."

02:32:31.500 --> 02:32:33.523
Kind of gently pushes it in.

02:32:34.570 --> 02:32:35.913
Looks back to you again.

02:32:37.270 --> 02:32:38.430
Goes to the third chair.

02:32:38.430 --> 02:32:42.180
LIAM: Caleb is watching, like, a mixture of mortification

02:32:42.180 --> 02:32:45.390
and hilarity, but, like, not smiling.

02:32:45.390 --> 02:32:46.440
Just...

02:32:47.692 --> 02:32:50.760
LAURA: Eadwulf, wouldn't you like to sit down next to me?

02:32:50.760 --> 02:32:52.052
TALIESIN: I walk to the chair.

02:32:53.400 --> 02:32:54.750
MATT: You walk to the chair.

02:32:54.750 --> 02:32:55.760
TALIESIN: I pull it out.

02:32:57.070 --> 02:32:58.000
For you.

02:32:58.000 --> 02:32:59.250
SAM: Oh!

02:33:01.130 --> 02:33:02.230
MATT: "Thank you."

02:33:03.335 --> 02:33:05.408
And he sits down.
MARISHA: Pull it out.

02:33:05.408 --> 02:33:06.990
(laughter)

02:33:06.990 --> 02:33:08.607
TALIESIN: Just wanted to make...
TRAVIS: (boof)

02:33:08.607 --> 02:33:10.089
(gasps, yells)

02:33:10.089 --> 02:33:12.417
TALIESIN: (whoosh) Ha ha ha. Run!

02:33:13.800 --> 02:33:15.725
MARISHA: I sit across from Caduceus.

02:33:15.725 --> 02:33:18.258
TALIESIN: Yeah, so we have eyes on either side of the--

02:33:18.258 --> 02:33:19.425
MARISHA: Good call.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:33:20.430 --> 02:33:22.630
MATT: As everyone takes their seat and finishes,

02:33:23.550 --> 02:33:26.920
Trent, who's leaning back in this high-backed chair

02:33:26.920 --> 02:33:29.770
that comes up to these hook-like hands

02:33:29.770 --> 02:33:33.320
that are currently reaching over the top of the back,

02:33:33.320 --> 02:33:37.470
puts his arms up and (claps) gives a clap.

02:33:37.470 --> 02:33:40.018
And you feel this wind (whoosh) rush through the chamber

02:33:40.018 --> 02:33:44.031
and the doors you came through (creak, thud) close.

02:33:45.440 --> 02:33:48.443
(as Trent) "The meal will be arriving shortly.

02:33:49.550 --> 02:33:51.066
"In the interim,

02:33:52.058 --> 02:33:55.408
"I am happy to have you as guests in my home."

02:33:55.408 --> 02:33:57.465
LAURA: I can't hear you, can you speak a little louder?

02:33:57.465 --> 02:34:00.482
(laughter)

02:34:00.482 --> 02:34:02.475
I'm sorry, I'm just so far down here.

02:34:04.530 --> 02:34:06.730
MATT: He then begins to introduce.

02:34:06.730 --> 02:34:10.030
(laughter)

02:34:10.030 --> 02:34:11.320
"My companions."

02:34:11.320 --> 02:34:14.960
As he speaks, his mouth does not move any longer.

02:34:14.960 --> 02:34:18.500
Instead, the language seems to be coming from all sides

02:34:18.500 --> 02:34:20.460
directly into your mind.

02:34:20.460 --> 02:34:21.335
MARISHA: Cool.
SAM: That's cool.

02:34:21.335 --> 02:34:22.509
TRAVIS: Oh no.

02:34:24.390 --> 02:34:27.032
MATT: As he just stares intently across the table.

02:34:28.010 --> 02:34:33.010
"My companions for the night, of which you are familiar.

02:34:34.470 --> 02:34:38.236
"Childhood friends of your companion,

02:34:38.236 --> 02:34:41.971
"this Caleb Widogast,

02:34:41.971 --> 02:34:44.265
"or as we've known him, Bren.

02:34:46.320 --> 02:34:47.805
"This is Astrid."

02:34:49.290 --> 02:34:50.623
Points to her.

02:34:51.550 --> 02:34:53.117
"And this is Eadwulf."

02:34:54.744 --> 02:34:55.994
And he gives a nod.

02:34:58.053 --> 02:35:00.677
"Now, I must say, I'm quite impressed

02:35:01.630 --> 02:35:03.030
"ow you all have come together

02:35:03.030 --> 02:35:05.605
"and done so much in such a short time.

02:35:07.170 --> 02:35:10.080
"What is, if I might inquire, the driving force

02:35:10.080 --> 02:35:11.707
"behind your travels?

02:35:13.192 --> 02:35:15.042
"What is your mutual goal?"

02:35:18.478 --> 02:35:23.003
SAM: Boy, that is-- that's a tricky one to start with.

02:35:25.270 --> 02:35:30.258
We are driven by many forces, but mostly justice.

02:35:31.820 --> 02:35:33.100
Right?
LAURA: Yeah.

02:35:33.100 --> 02:35:35.350
SAM: Right? Mostly justice.

02:35:35.350 --> 02:35:36.910
LIAM: I think mostly we are just trying

02:35:36.910 --> 02:35:39.928
to leave the world better than when we found it.

02:35:41.910 --> 02:35:44.160
MATT: "So we are not too different, then."

02:35:45.470 --> 02:35:49.538
SAM: Oh, you seek to change the world for the better?

02:35:50.551 --> 02:35:53.388
MATT: "Well, what is the purpose of power

02:35:53.388 --> 02:35:55.315
"if not to use it properly?"

02:35:57.180 --> 02:36:02.180
LIAM: Much for us to celebrate together at this time.

02:36:02.230 --> 02:36:03.879
MATT: "Indeed."
LIAM: We have achieved peace

02:36:03.879 --> 02:36:05.479
after so much struggle.

02:36:10.640 --> 02:36:11.748
MATT: "So."

02:36:15.020 --> 02:36:18.400
There's this pregnant pause at the table

02:36:18.400 --> 02:36:22.493
as he begins to scan across each one of you.

02:36:23.750 --> 02:36:24.770
LIAM: I'm doing the same.

02:36:24.770 --> 02:36:27.750
Can I ask what kind of vibe I'm getting

02:36:27.750 --> 02:36:29.935
from Astrid and Eadwulf?

02:36:29.935 --> 02:36:31.850
MATT: I was about to say, as soon as you're doing this,

02:36:31.850 --> 02:36:35.480
Astrid pipes up and goes, "Indeed,

02:36:35.480 --> 02:36:39.805
"it is a pleasure to meet all of these friends of... Caleb,

02:36:39.805 --> 02:36:42.522
"it is a pleasure to meet all of these friends of... Caleb,

02:36:42.522 --> 02:36:45.783
"just as it is good to see you as well, my friend,

02:36:47.838 --> 02:36:50.470
"and I'm happy to get the chance to know

02:36:50.470 --> 02:36:54.860
"those who have kept him companions and safe

02:36:54.860 --> 02:36:56.710
"in the time that we could not.

02:36:59.530 --> 02:37:01.260
"Right, Eadwulf?"

02:37:03.478 --> 02:37:07.057
(as Eadwulf) "Indeed, I have seen
some of you at the sanatorium.

02:37:08.350 --> 02:37:10.708
"Seems fate continues to draw us together.

02:37:11.800 --> 02:37:16.520
"Perhaps the Matron has plans for us together yet, huh?"

02:37:19.180 --> 02:37:20.472
LAURA: Who's the Matron?

02:37:21.390 --> 02:37:24.140
MARISHA: Is he referring to the Matron of Ravens?

02:37:29.150 --> 02:37:31.135
MATT: "And you, what are you?"

02:37:31.135 --> 02:37:35.280
You see Eadwulf gives a weird half-grin.

02:37:35.280 --> 02:37:37.710
TALIESIN: Vegetarian, so I hope the meal reflects that.

02:37:37.710 --> 02:37:39.943
(laughter)

02:37:39.943 --> 02:37:41.893
MARISHA: Yes!
TRAVIS: Nice.

02:37:43.930 --> 02:37:45.198
MATT: Smile fades.

02:37:45.198 --> 02:37:47.282
(laughs)

02:37:50.528 --> 02:37:53.069
(as Trent) "Well, I guess...

02:37:55.070 --> 02:37:58.670
"Before I get too deep into my particular interests

02:37:58.670 --> 02:38:03.173
"for the night, what questions have you for me?"

02:38:10.460 --> 02:38:13.970
LIAM: Well, I am curious, now that we have reached

02:38:13.970 --> 02:38:16.621
some quiet between the two nations,

02:38:19.390 --> 02:38:23.098
seeing as how central you are

02:38:24.223 --> 02:38:26.573
to the decision making here in the Empire.

02:38:28.550 --> 02:38:30.150
What's the next step?

02:38:30.150 --> 02:38:34.450
MATT: "Well, I do apologize.

02:38:34.450 --> 02:38:37.700
"You have not been around for the full scope

02:38:37.700 --> 02:38:42.680
"of our political engine, but I do not make decisions.

02:38:42.680 --> 02:38:46.340
"I merely guide.

02:38:46.340 --> 02:38:48.890
"Offer suggestions.

02:38:51.380 --> 02:38:53.510
"As to what is next, well...

02:38:56.380 --> 02:38:57.763
"There are many paths.

02:39:01.210 --> 02:39:02.882
"Am I to know...

02:39:04.390 --> 02:39:09.380
"It seems you have fallen with Vess DeRogna, yes?"

02:39:12.310 --> 02:39:14.860
LIAM: We will be spending some
time with her, that is correct.

02:39:14.860 --> 02:39:15.693
MATT: "Mmm.

02:39:17.590 --> 02:39:19.727
"And what errands, if I might inquire,

02:39:19.727 --> 02:39:22.083
"has she procured your skills for?"

02:39:23.670 --> 02:39:24.786
LAURA: You might not.

02:39:26.970 --> 02:39:28.053
Inquire.

02:39:29.910 --> 02:39:31.850
TALIESIN: Respectfully, I feel that that information

02:39:31.850 --> 02:39:36.850
would be considered of a private nature.

02:39:37.249 --> 02:39:39.470
MATT: "Of course, of course."

02:39:40.878 --> 02:39:44.300
MARISHA: Does he feel like-- does he already know?

02:39:44.300 --> 02:39:45.963
Does he already know, he just wants to hear it from us?

02:39:45.963 --> 02:39:47.324
MATT: Make an insight check.
TALIESIN: I was going to say,

02:39:47.324 --> 02:39:50.040
my insight check is just not stopping.

02:39:50.040 --> 02:39:51.056
MATT: Yeah.

02:39:55.630 --> 02:39:57.160
MARISHA: 17.
TALIESIN: 22.

02:39:57.160 --> 02:39:58.143
MATT: 22?

02:40:02.430 --> 02:40:06.670
There isn't a lack of confidence in his inquiry,

02:40:06.670 --> 02:40:09.830
and he does not appear to be finished.

02:40:09.830 --> 02:40:13.850
As he goes, "Is she looking to perhaps drag you

02:40:13.850 --> 02:40:17.542
"to Shattengrod as glorified tomb raiders, huh?

02:40:19.499 --> 02:40:20.399
"No?

02:40:22.200 --> 02:40:26.720
"Hmm, perhaps your familiarity with Xhorhasian society

02:40:28.040 --> 02:40:30.485
"is to aid her in our acquisitions there.

02:40:35.560 --> 02:40:40.186
"Or is she hoping to bring you to some place colder?"

02:40:47.908 --> 02:40:49.840
TALIESIN: Well, that is a conversation
you should have with her.

02:40:49.840 --> 02:40:52.090
LAURA: I know-- as far as I know, she just wants us

02:40:52.090 --> 02:40:56.390
to hang out for intimate reasons, you know?

02:40:56.390 --> 02:40:58.251
We're all very attractive.

02:40:59.384 --> 02:41:01.173
TALIESIN: That's fair.
MATT: Make a deception check.

02:41:01.173 --> 02:41:02.732
LAURA: (laughs)

02:41:07.350 --> 02:41:08.810
TALIESIN: I feel like she should get advantage

02:41:08.810 --> 02:41:11.248
for the fact that we are very attractive.

02:41:11.248 --> 02:41:12.248
MATT: (laughs)

02:41:12.248 --> 02:41:13.081
TALIESIN: Sorry.

02:41:15.400 --> 02:41:16.520
LAURA: 15.

02:41:16.520 --> 02:41:17.511
MATT: Okay.

02:41:19.530 --> 02:41:24.520
"Well, wherever it is that you all intend to travel,

02:41:24.520 --> 02:41:27.403
"I hope you do so safely and without issue."

02:41:28.700 --> 02:41:29.920
LAURA: Without any tissue?

02:41:29.920 --> 02:41:31.210
SAM: Yeah, we won't need any.

02:41:31.210 --> 02:41:32.973
We're not sick or anything.

02:41:35.396 --> 02:41:37.396
MATT: "Hmm. A joke, yes."

02:41:40.440 --> 02:41:42.360
The doors enter and you watch

02:41:42.360 --> 02:41:47.360
as these platters begin to just hover in the faint breeze,

02:41:47.410 --> 02:41:51.385
held aloft on their own, (clinking)

02:41:51.385 --> 02:41:53.218
filling up the table before you.

02:41:54.890 --> 02:41:58.758
LAURA: That's cool. (applauds)

02:41:59.890 --> 02:42:02.870
MATT: As you see Eadwulf takes a scarf and

02:42:02.870 --> 02:42:06.060
tucks it into the top of his shirt,

02:42:06.060 --> 02:42:08.243
and Astrid takes and puts it in her lap.

02:42:12.590 --> 02:42:13.803
Trent leans in.

02:42:19.760 --> 02:42:20.943
"No questions, then?"

02:42:21.980 --> 02:42:23.713
LIAM: So many questions.

02:42:27.170 --> 02:42:28.262
How's the new crop?

02:42:31.450 --> 02:42:32.550
How are your children?

02:42:33.591 --> 02:42:37.586
MATT: "Well, the children are doing well.

02:42:38.440 --> 02:42:40.173
"Some more than others."

02:42:41.880 --> 02:42:44.015
LIAM: Not everyone has the stomach for it.

02:42:44.015 --> 02:42:45.265
MATT: "Hmm.

02:42:46.880 --> 02:42:48.413
"We lost a...

02:42:50.880 --> 02:42:53.096
"talented prospect not long ago."

02:42:56.070 --> 02:42:57.270
LAURA: How did you lose them?

02:42:58.510 --> 02:43:00.170
MATT: "They were captured in Rosohna."

02:43:03.152 --> 02:43:03.985
MARISHA: Oh.

02:43:06.090 --> 02:43:06.963
Blondie.

02:43:08.005 --> 02:43:08.853
LAURA: That's unfortunate.

02:43:08.853 --> 02:43:10.100
SAM: Not Blondie.

02:43:10.100 --> 02:43:12.611
LIAM: No, in the prison in Xhorhas.
SAM: The girl in the prison.

02:43:12.611 --> 02:43:13.444
LAURA: Yeah.

02:43:16.651 --> 02:43:17.950
MARISHA: What's-her-butt?

02:43:17.950 --> 02:43:20.558
LIAM: Well, the Empire will always yield up

02:43:22.691 --> 02:43:23.866
more youth.

02:43:29.380 --> 02:43:32.130
I find hope

02:43:33.121 --> 02:43:36.270
in the quiet that was achieved at sea.

02:43:36.270 --> 02:43:38.753
Maybe I'm naive. I'm sure you think so.

02:43:42.220 --> 02:43:46.580
How wonderful it would be if the two sides

02:43:46.580 --> 02:43:51.566
could approach each other with that forthrightness always.

02:43:53.950 --> 02:43:56.950
You said that you make no decisions, you only advise.

02:43:56.950 --> 02:43:58.233
A thought experiment.

02:43:58.233 --> 02:43:59.420
MATT: "Mm-hmm."

02:43:59.420 --> 02:44:03.095
LIAM: Pretend that I am King Dwendal.

02:44:03.095 --> 02:44:03.936
MATT: "Very well."

02:44:03.936 --> 02:44:05.011
LIAM: In this moment,

02:44:07.640 --> 02:44:08.673
advise me.

02:44:09.950 --> 02:44:10.783
MATT: "To?

02:44:13.430 --> 02:44:14.460
"As the king?"

02:44:14.460 --> 02:44:18.170
LIAM: In your opinion, do we keep this momentum going,

02:44:18.170 --> 02:44:23.110
or use it as a feint?

02:44:25.610 --> 02:44:28.563
And dig in harder in all the traditional ways?

02:44:29.580 --> 02:44:31.022
What is your advice?

02:44:32.506 --> 02:44:34.631
MATT: "My advice,

02:44:34.631 --> 02:44:38.689
"oh great King Dwendal,

02:44:41.900 --> 02:44:46.675
"is to use this momentum to rally the populace

02:44:46.675 --> 02:44:48.475
"is to use this momentum to rally the populace

02:44:48.475 --> 02:44:51.358
"around the idea of your benevolence

02:44:51.358 --> 02:44:56.345
"and your ability to keep them safe from outside aggression.

02:44:56.345 --> 02:44:57.178
"and your ability to keep them safe from outside aggression.

02:45:02.040 --> 02:45:06.933
"But to keep a very close eye in all the shaded places,

02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:14.558
"There are so many lives and only so much land."

02:45:19.540 --> 02:45:21.110
TALIESIN: How does he do that?

02:45:22.332 --> 02:45:23.165
LAURA: Yeah, really?

02:45:23.165 --> 02:45:25.770
TALIESIN: That was literally both answers at the same time.

02:45:25.770 --> 02:45:27.200
He just said yes twice.

02:45:27.200 --> 02:45:28.233
That was amazing.

02:45:31.040 --> 02:45:31.873
Wow.

02:45:40.210 --> 02:45:43.600
LIAM: I look diagonally down at Eadwulf.

02:45:48.550 --> 02:45:50.493
Like a little more perspective, Wulf.

02:45:53.601 --> 02:45:55.199
How are things going?

02:45:58.099 --> 02:46:01.670
MATT: "Well, at the moment it is not as busy.

02:46:01.670 --> 02:46:06.630
"So I am enjoying a little more of a relaxed schedule.

02:46:09.290 --> 02:46:11.133
"You look good."

02:46:11.133 --> 02:46:13.110
LIAM: Say again?
MATT: "You look good."

02:46:13.110 --> 02:46:13.943
LIAM: Oh.

02:46:18.151 --> 02:46:18.984
Well.

02:46:20.675 --> 02:46:24.838
It's a wonder what travel will do, and sun on your back.

02:46:24.838 --> 02:46:26.150
MATT: "Hmm."

02:46:26.150 --> 02:46:29.300
SAM: When the war was a bit hotter than it is now,

02:46:29.300 --> 02:46:31.220
were you very busy?

02:46:31.220 --> 02:46:34.453
You, Wulf? Eadwulf?

02:46:36.770 --> 02:46:39.197
MATT: "Not any busier than you were, apparently."

02:46:40.740 --> 02:46:43.433
SAM: Well, yes, but were you on the front lines?

02:46:44.380 --> 02:46:46.983
MATT: "I'm not a frontline sort of fighter.

02:46:48.610 --> 02:46:53.610
"I have different skills. More of a scout, if you will."

02:46:54.041 --> 02:46:58.657
SAM: Did you go into enemy lines

02:46:58.657 --> 02:47:01.460
and go on missions and things?

02:47:01.460 --> 02:47:02.653
Exciting things?

02:47:02.653 --> 02:47:04.511
MATT: "Many exciting things."

02:47:04.511 --> 02:47:06.244
SAM: Yeah? Like what?

02:47:06.244 --> 02:47:07.976
LIAM: Yeah, I'm curious, like Veth.

02:47:07.976 --> 02:47:11.420
I missed a year or two.

02:47:11.420 --> 02:47:13.770
What have you both been filling your time with?

02:47:15.650 --> 02:47:17.900
MATT: Looks over towards Astrid, and Astrid

02:47:19.160 --> 02:47:20.326
narrows her eyes a bit

02:47:20.326 --> 02:47:22.551
and pulls her head back and he smiles.

02:47:28.125 --> 02:47:30.337
"We're doing what we do best, Bren.

02:47:33.050 --> 02:47:34.908
"Ensure history walks the right path."

02:47:37.900 --> 02:47:39.650
LAURA: Have you been taking up hairstyling?

02:47:39.650 --> 02:47:43.780
Because Astrid's got a pretty cool one.

02:47:43.780 --> 02:47:45.630
Was it Eadwulf that did that for you?

02:47:46.962 --> 02:47:48.615
MATT: You say this to Astrid?
LAURA: Uh-huh.

02:47:48.615 --> 02:47:49.573
MATT: Astrid goes,

02:47:51.891 --> 02:47:53.874
"No, this is...

02:47:55.888 --> 02:47:57.418
"This is my own design."

02:47:57.418 --> 02:47:58.629
LAURA: Oh, you did that yourself?

02:47:58.629 --> 02:48:00.310
MATT: She takes and pours a little bit of wine.

02:48:00.310 --> 02:48:02.980
"Mm-hmm."
LAURA: Wow.

02:48:02.980 --> 02:48:04.070
MATT: "Why, do you not like it?"

02:48:04.070 --> 02:48:05.053
LAURA: No, I love it.

02:48:06.380 --> 02:48:07.380
I love it.

02:48:07.380 --> 02:48:09.510
MATT: "Would you like your hair like it as well?"

02:48:10.347 --> 02:48:12.740
LAURA: That's okay. It's so original.

02:48:12.740 --> 02:48:14.660
I wouldn't want to steal your thunder.

02:48:14.660 --> 02:48:17.060
TALIESIN: Hmm. You might've chosen the wrong profession.

02:48:19.127 --> 02:48:20.637
MATT: "It's my profession that allows me to do this."

02:48:20.637 --> 02:48:22.040
And you watch as she flicks her finger

02:48:22.040 --> 02:48:24.646
and the hair suddenly grows long and curls up

02:48:24.646 --> 02:48:29.220
in this extremely bouncing, healthy,

02:48:29.220 --> 02:48:33.095
shoulder bob, and then it recoils upward into this--

02:48:33.095 --> 02:48:36.206
MARISHA: Careful, you got some
BÃ©arnaise in a lock right there.

02:48:36.206 --> 02:48:38.502
You got a little out of control with that.

02:48:38.502 --> 02:48:40.622
TALIESIN: World could always use a barber.

02:48:40.622 --> 02:48:44.268
MARISHA: It got a little on your lapel.

02:48:44.268 --> 02:48:45.390
TALIESIN: I don't have that.

02:48:45.390 --> 02:48:46.877
LAURA: That's really cool.

02:48:46.877 --> 02:48:49.330
That's a really cool spell.

02:48:49.330 --> 02:48:51.030
That's a really cool spell.

02:48:51.030 --> 02:48:51.863
MATT: "Thank you."

02:48:55.137 --> 02:48:57.093
TALIESIN: Flexing a fine talent.

02:48:57.093 --> 02:48:58.524
MATT: She looks back to Bren.

02:48:58.524 --> 02:49:02.100
LAURA: Do you ever teach people
how to do those kind of spells?

02:49:02.100 --> 02:49:04.550
Because I would love to know how to do that spell.

02:49:05.630 --> 02:49:08.900
MATT: "Well, no, these are the things that are taught

02:49:08.900 --> 02:49:12.200
"after years of training at the Soltryce Academy."

02:49:12.200 --> 02:49:14.550
LAURA: Is it so you can like, change your looks?

02:49:14.550 --> 02:49:15.383
MATT: "Mm-hmm."

02:49:15.383 --> 02:49:18.580
LAURA: Because there's easy Disguise Self spells, you know.

02:49:18.580 --> 02:49:19.763
Those are, like, easy.

02:49:19.763 --> 02:49:20.840
MATT: "Yeah.

02:49:20.840 --> 02:49:23.290
"Then you know all about this sort of magic, then."

02:49:26.550 --> 02:49:27.597
LAURA: Oh.

02:49:27.597 --> 02:49:29.720
MARISHA: (laughs)

02:49:29.720 --> 02:49:33.040
LAURA: Oh, I guess I could just
change my hair on a whim, huh?

02:49:33.040 --> 02:49:35.425
But that looked like you were really changing your hair.

02:49:35.425 --> 02:49:37.687
Were you really changing your hair?

02:49:37.687 --> 02:49:39.130
MATT: "Glamors."

02:49:39.130 --> 02:49:39.963
LAURA: Wow.

02:49:41.020 --> 02:49:42.953
Caleb, I went to learn about glamors.

02:49:44.100 --> 02:49:46.193
MARISHA: That's why her tits look so amazing.

02:49:51.103 --> 02:49:53.294
LAURA: We are such assholes.

02:49:53.294 --> 02:49:54.127
MATT: (laughing) You guys.

02:49:54.990 --> 02:49:57.180
LIAM: Yeah, Caleb is working real hard

02:49:57.180 --> 02:50:01.260
to keep a blush down through all of this.

02:50:01.260 --> 02:50:04.773
MATT: Astrid leans forward and goes, "So, Bren.

02:50:08.950 --> 02:50:09.858
"We miss you.

02:50:11.641 --> 02:50:13.440
"We're glad to see that you're safe

02:50:15.123 --> 02:50:16.406
"and doing so well."

02:50:19.030 --> 02:50:20.403
LIAM: I have good friends.

02:50:21.990 --> 02:50:22.990
They're good people.

02:50:28.510 --> 02:50:31.130
SAM: Are you trying to invite him back?

02:50:31.130 --> 02:50:32.400
Is that why we're here?

02:50:32.400 --> 02:50:36.530
Are you asking him back into the fold?

02:50:36.530 --> 02:50:38.670
MATT: "Oh, I'm not doing that, no."

02:50:40.176 --> 02:50:42.008
Trent leans forward in his seat and goes,

02:50:43.550 --> 02:50:48.125
"I'm more-- just wanted to express my...

02:50:49.400 --> 02:50:51.400
"pleasure with Bren's--

02:50:53.010 --> 02:50:57.953
"Caleb's advancement as the prodigy I always knew he was.

"through self-discovery,

"others inspired through hardship.

"come from those who have endured the dark

"and crawled their way back."

02:51:37.390 --> 02:51:40.783
SAM: So you're apologizing, then?

02:51:41.874 --> 02:51:44.380
MARISHA: No, it sounds like he's
trying to take fucking credit.

02:51:44.380 --> 02:51:46.530
TALIESIN: Yeah, it didn't sound like an apology to me.

02:51:48.460 --> 02:51:51.370
MATT: "Of my handful of vigilant reaches,

02:51:51.370 --> 02:51:53.350
"I've had a fondness for you three."

02:51:53.350 --> 02:51:57.483
And he gestures towards the three students.

02:51:59.865 --> 02:52:02.373
"Eadwulf and Astrid are skilled in so much.

02:53:12.770 --> 02:53:16.403
"we turned on the light and showed you the door."

02:53:22.367 --> 02:53:26.260
And he takes something from the side of his setting,

02:53:26.260 --> 02:53:28.870
and it drifts over across the table in your direction

02:53:28.870 --> 02:53:31.353
and lands at the front of your plate.

02:53:33.065 --> 02:53:36.518
You see a familiar symbol, that of the Arch Heart.

02:53:49.643 --> 02:53:51.713
LIAM: This is why I am not dead.

02:53:55.620 --> 02:53:56.453
MATT: "Of course.

02:54:01.400 --> 02:54:04.953
"If we wanted you dead, there would have been no escape.

02:54:09.480 --> 02:54:11.883
"And I cannot tell you how proud of you I am.

02:54:13.210 --> 02:54:14.376
"We are.

02:54:19.374 --> 02:54:22.057
"And I know you hate me, Bren.

02:54:23.340 --> 02:54:24.890
"Hate what I've put you through,

02:54:26.187 --> 02:54:28.023
"and I accept those feelings.

02:54:30.115 --> 02:54:32.806
"For it was a hard choice for me to make.

02:54:35.560 --> 02:54:40.560
"What I did, though, I did out of love."

02:54:40.724 --> 02:54:41.624
LAURA: (scoffs)

02:54:44.522 --> 02:54:45.913
LIAM: To what end?

02:54:48.180 --> 02:54:49.130
To use me?

02:54:49.130 --> 02:54:53.571
MATT: "No, to show you what you are capable of.

02:54:59.160 --> 02:55:02.950
"It was your parents' wish when I told them

02:55:02.950 --> 02:55:05.943
"of the spark that I saw within you.

02:55:07.790 --> 02:55:09.470
"They asked me to do whatever it took

02:55:09.470 --> 02:55:12.161
"to help you realize it,

02:55:12.161 --> 02:55:14.710
"for the glory of your family

02:55:14.710 --> 02:55:15.733
"and for the Empire.

02:55:18.590 --> 02:55:20.990
"I did just that, as much as it hurt to hurt you.

02:55:24.280 --> 02:55:25.500
"It is the greater man who puts

02:55:25.500 --> 02:55:27.667
"the needs of others over himself, Bren.

02:55:29.107 --> 02:55:30.690
"And this nation needs you."

02:55:32.180 --> 02:55:33.013
LAURA: Insight check.

02:55:33.013 --> 02:55:33.846
MATT: "We need you."

02:55:35.654 --> 02:55:37.041
Make an insight check.

02:55:39.120 --> 02:55:40.230
LAURA: Lying.

02:55:40.230 --> 02:55:42.560
LIAM: My eye flicks to Astrid's.

02:55:42.560 --> 02:55:44.336
LAURA: Natural fucking 20.

02:55:44.336 --> 02:55:46.346
LIAM: Ooh!

02:55:46.346 --> 02:55:47.187
ASHLEY: Yes.

02:55:47.187 --> 02:55:48.383
MATT: I'll text you real fast.

02:55:49.593 --> 02:55:51.260
MATT: (chuckles)

02:55:51.260 --> 02:55:53.560
LIAM: I would like to insight check Astrid.

02:55:53.560 --> 02:55:55.660
MATT: Go for it.
LIAM: To see if she's going along with it.

02:55:58.868 --> 02:56:00.709
Not a natural 20, but

02:56:02.492 --> 02:56:03.334
25.

02:56:03.334 --> 02:56:04.690
MATT: 25, okay.

02:56:04.690 --> 02:56:06.990
What's your total with the natural 20, Jester?

02:56:08.310 --> 02:56:09.460
LAURA: 25.

02:56:09.460 --> 02:56:11.900
MATT: Damn, look at that, two 25s.

02:56:11.900 --> 02:56:12.866
SAM: Wow.

02:56:12.866 --> 02:56:13.699
Wow.

02:56:14.617 --> 02:56:16.317
We might actually learn something.

02:56:17.190 --> 02:56:18.865
MATT: Okay, give me just a second.

02:56:20.320 --> 02:56:22.010
LAURA: Takes longer to text than it does--

02:56:22.010 --> 02:56:23.563
TRAVIS: This insight check brought to you by--

02:56:23.563 --> 02:56:27.120
SAM: This text brought to you by Dwarven Forge.

02:56:27.120 --> 02:56:31.000
Makers of the world's finest modular gaming terrain.

02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:33.843
MATT: Oh, the curses of COVID distance.

02:56:34.720 --> 02:56:36.870
I miss the whispers, it so much easier.

02:56:36.870 --> 02:56:38.020
LIAM: 2020's hard, man.

02:56:38.020 --> 02:56:39.323
MATT: I know.
LAURA: Yeah.

02:56:39.323 --> 02:56:42.470
It's really hard to stay quiet during--

02:56:42.470 --> 02:56:43.463
MARISHA: I know!

02:56:43.463 --> 02:56:45.330
LAURA: -- his speech.
MARISHA: Ugh!

02:56:45.330 --> 02:56:47.410
SAM: Matt, you know, it would be easier and faster

02:56:47.410 --> 02:56:50.817
if you just did it with Siri with just the--

02:56:50.817 --> 02:56:52.176
MATT: You're right!

02:56:52.176 --> 02:56:53.238
LAURA: Oh, oh, oh.

02:56:53.238 --> 02:56:54.260
MATT: And I will tell this to you out loud,

02:56:54.260 --> 02:56:58.311
because this is less tricksy.

02:57:00.580 --> 02:57:04.430
With the 25, you can--

02:57:05.560 --> 02:57:08.810
She's looking towards you with

02:57:11.880 --> 02:57:16.046
a feeling of internal conflict

02:57:16.046 --> 02:57:18.054
that you weren't expecting.

02:57:18.990 --> 02:57:23.418
You can see there is a softness and a yearning,

02:57:25.790 --> 02:57:28.183
but her body language is leaning away from him.

02:57:29.110 --> 02:57:30.613
LIAM: From Trent?
MATT: From Trent.

02:57:36.410 --> 02:57:40.410
And you see a glimmer in there

02:57:40.410 --> 02:57:42.271
of the Astrid you once knew.

02:57:45.740 --> 02:57:47.740
Ever so faintly...

02:57:50.232 --> 02:57:51.065
worried.

02:57:51.990 --> 02:57:53.360
LIAM: Worried?

02:57:53.360 --> 02:57:55.560
MATT: About your response.
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

02:57:58.520 --> 02:58:01.353
MARISHA: Is Eadwulf just chowing down on his steak?

02:58:02.683 --> 02:58:03.920
MATT: Oh, no, he's mid-chew.

02:58:03.920 --> 02:58:05.932
He's like--

02:58:05.932 --> 02:58:06.781
MARISHA: Okay.

02:58:06.781 --> 02:58:09.578
MATT: He's intently watching, and just like--

02:58:14.250 --> 02:58:16.310
LIAM: You will have to walk me through

02:58:18.132 --> 02:58:22.453
the logic of this long con.

02:58:25.050 --> 02:58:28.000
Because I do loathe you.

02:58:30.353 --> 02:58:31.486
Deeply.

02:58:32.930 --> 02:58:34.080
MATT: "Of course."

02:58:35.870 --> 02:58:39.435
LIAM: But you do nothing flagrantly.

02:58:40.690 --> 02:58:42.561
Everything is very careful.

02:58:44.095 --> 02:58:44.936
MATT: "Indeed."

02:58:44.936 --> 02:58:48.473
LIAM: So how would you hope to use me as a tool?

02:58:52.350 --> 02:58:55.477
MATT: "This isn't to use you as a tool, Bren.

02:59:06.527 --> 02:59:08.585
"And there isn't a word I could say that

02:59:08.585 --> 02:59:12.863
"would find your ears with belief.

02:59:14.530 --> 02:59:15.363
"Correct?"

02:59:19.059 --> 02:59:21.142
LIAM: Say that one more time?

02:59:21.142 --> 02:59:22.250
Because of the social distance.

02:59:22.250 --> 02:59:23.083
MATT: Yeah.

02:59:25.060 --> 02:59:27.700
"There is no phrase or words I could say

02:59:27.700 --> 02:59:30.523
"that you would find yourself able to believe."

02:59:35.510 --> 02:59:37.203
LIAM: It's hard to forget the past.

02:59:38.900 --> 02:59:40.100
MATT: "Then do not forget it.

02:59:41.570 --> 02:59:42.403
"Use it.

02:59:45.830 --> 02:59:48.323
"If I am to be the focus of your hatred,

02:59:50.140 --> 02:59:51.493
"I accepted that long ago.

02:59:54.850 --> 02:59:58.010
"But what you are now, what you've accomplished,

02:59:58.010 --> 03:00:01.583
"those you've drawn around you, and where you go.

03:00:04.360 --> 03:00:06.310
"That is because of what you've endured.

03:00:07.881 --> 03:00:11.790
"Not because of a book you read in some hall

03:00:13.770 --> 03:00:16.693
"with other sniveling, rich children.

03:00:18.960 --> 03:00:20.023
"You made yourself.

03:00:22.980 --> 03:00:24.983
"Not myself, not them.

03:00:29.290 --> 03:00:31.148
"But it took

03:00:31.148 --> 03:00:35.640
"that path of pain

03:00:37.781 --> 03:00:39.880
"to accomplish what this is.

03:00:45.577 --> 03:00:49.120
"And you're not the only one of us in the Assembly

03:00:51.710 --> 03:00:56.293
"to have been through similar trauma

03:00:56.293 --> 03:00:57.909
"and been defined by it."

03:01:03.627 --> 03:01:06.610
LIAM: I dead-eye stare Astrid

03:01:06.610 --> 03:01:08.676
while talking to Trent

03:01:10.374 --> 03:01:14.140
and say: And you think that

03:01:14.140 --> 03:01:15.973
my mother and father,

03:01:19.380 --> 03:01:21.930
our mothers and fathers and children,

03:01:25.180 --> 03:01:29.123
should serve as grist for the mill in this way?

03:01:38.130 --> 03:01:39.530
MATT: (as Astrid) "Whatever it takes

03:01:39.530 --> 03:01:44.163
"to keep the people of this Empire safe.

03:01:50.870 --> 03:01:53.620
"The wants of one do not outweigh the wants of the many.

03:01:56.954 --> 03:01:57.787
"Right?"

03:02:05.985 --> 03:02:07.635
Eadwulf leans forward and goes,

03:02:11.133 --> 03:02:13.966
"Our parents made a sacrifice, yes?

03:02:15.241 --> 03:02:17.663
"Like any soldier does in the battlefield."

03:02:34.360 --> 03:02:36.803
LIAM: If we cannot protect our own,

03:02:38.908 --> 03:02:40.783
then all of it is a failure.

03:02:47.620 --> 03:02:49.433
Why did we get into this?

03:02:50.910 --> 03:02:55.350
Why did we serve with such vigor,

03:02:59.060 --> 03:03:00.833
if not to protect.

03:03:08.220 --> 03:03:09.636
MATT: (as Trent) "You see,

03:03:12.628 --> 03:03:15.419
"when talent rises from nothing,

03:03:20.480 --> 03:03:22.113
"then nothing truly is lost.

03:03:28.980 --> 03:03:32.993
"You are far more than where you came from."

03:03:42.200 --> 03:03:46.840
LIAM: So you've sent me off like a windup clockwork toy

03:03:49.130 --> 03:03:50.751
to serve the Empire.

03:03:53.517 --> 03:03:54.608
Am I right?

03:03:56.400 --> 03:04:01.400
What if the thing to do now is to supplant you,

03:04:01.990 --> 03:04:05.393
to pull you up like a weed and do better.

03:04:07.820 --> 03:04:09.377
You comfortable with that idea?

03:04:10.873 --> 03:04:13.423
MATT: "Nothing would make me prouder."

03:04:16.623 --> 03:04:18.016
LAURA: Insight check.
MARISHA: Insight check.

03:04:18.016 --> 03:04:18.998
I know, yeah.

03:04:18.998 --> 03:04:20.374
He means it, doesn't he?

03:04:20.374 --> 03:04:21.810
Fuck, I know he means it.

03:04:21.810 --> 03:04:24.450
LIAM: I'm not even asking.

03:04:24.450 --> 03:04:26.216
MARISHA: That's great.
LAURA: Natural one.

03:04:26.216 --> 03:04:28.410
(laughter)

03:04:28.410 --> 03:04:29.490
SAM: Probably means it.

03:04:29.490 --> 03:04:30.920
TALIESIN: Got broccoli right here.
MARISHA: He means it.

03:04:30.920 --> 03:04:32.250
MATT: At this point, Jester dribbles

03:04:32.250 --> 03:04:33.083
down her chin a little bit.

03:04:33.083 --> 03:04:34.780
LAURA: I'm so sorry.

03:04:34.780 --> 03:04:36.551
I'm just-- this food looks really good.

03:04:36.551 --> 03:04:38.280
MARISHA: 15, he means it.

03:04:38.280 --> 03:04:40.730
MATT: He seems pretty honest, from what you can tell.

03:04:42.007 --> 03:04:43.421
LAURA: Beau!

03:04:43.421 --> 03:04:44.842
Beau!

03:04:44.842 --> 03:04:46.730
MARISHA: Yeah?
LAURA: Eat something already.

03:04:46.730 --> 03:04:49.200
MARISHA: I don't have a fucking appetite.

03:04:49.200 --> 03:04:50.613
He's disgusting.

03:04:54.757 --> 03:04:56.057
LIAM: Let's take it further.

03:04:57.652 --> 03:05:00.333
I look at Eadwulf and then at Astrid.

03:05:03.440 --> 03:05:05.173
When he is out of the picture

03:05:07.348 --> 03:05:09.423
and you and you and I

03:05:10.880 --> 03:05:14.046
carry the torch forward,

03:05:15.630 --> 03:05:17.405
we will mangle more children

03:05:20.979 --> 03:05:24.248
to feed the fields of Wynandir?

03:05:26.625 --> 03:05:29.253
MATT: Eadwulf sits back, crosses his arms.

03:05:30.252 --> 03:05:31.293
Looks to Astrid.

03:05:32.650 --> 03:05:34.880
Astrid looks to you and says,

03:05:39.420 --> 03:05:44.420
"Well, if you were to be

03:05:44.568 --> 03:05:46.434
"the bannerman of this tower,

03:05:48.961 --> 03:05:52.394
"that we are charged to,

03:05:52.394 --> 03:05:54.152
"then we do as you say.

03:05:57.780 --> 03:06:01.218
"If you want to bring more into this fold, we will.

03:06:02.610 --> 03:06:04.915
"If you want it to end, that's your command."

03:06:08.595 --> 03:06:11.103
LIAM: What about you, though?

03:06:11.103 --> 03:06:12.210
MATT: "What about me?"

03:06:15.970 --> 03:06:19.573
LIAM: When we spoke last, I had the impression that you

03:06:21.381 --> 03:06:25.161
were being groomed for this seat.

03:06:27.590 --> 03:06:29.640
MATT: She looks nervously over towards Trent,

03:06:30.883 --> 03:06:32.483
and Trent leans in a little bit.

03:06:39.320 --> 03:06:40.936
"My ambitions

03:06:43.895 --> 03:06:45.845
"and the paths laid before me

03:06:47.830 --> 03:06:52.697
"are not always congruent, Bren."

03:06:54.037 --> 03:06:56.780
And she looks deadly serious towards you.

03:06:56.780 --> 03:06:58.733
With a look of "<i>stop</i>."

03:07:08.100 --> 03:07:11.010
Trent leans forward with this grin,

03:07:11.010 --> 03:07:15.885
getting slowly more and more curled

03:07:15.885 --> 03:07:17.343
and confident.

03:07:19.810 --> 03:07:23.776
"Any man of my position assumes

03:07:23.776 --> 03:07:25.580
"that everyone I keep close

03:07:25.580 --> 03:07:27.923
"is just waiting for me to turn my back.

03:07:30.390 --> 03:07:33.890
"Every person in power knows that feeling,

03:07:33.890 --> 03:07:36.373
"lives by it.

03:07:40.391 --> 03:07:42.691
"It's the rare one that gets to choose.

03:07:45.500 --> 03:07:47.687
"I just hope you don't disappoint me, Bren."

03:08:01.251 --> 03:08:03.418
LIAM: That is a lot to absorb.

03:08:07.088 --> 03:08:09.724
It's been an interesting decade, to be sure.

03:08:12.900 --> 03:08:16.360
I often feel like a failure and a success

03:08:16.360 --> 03:08:17.780
within the same hour.

03:08:21.376 --> 03:08:22.560
MATT: "Then you are learning."

03:08:26.440 --> 03:08:29.148
LIAM: I have dreamed

03:08:31.015 --> 03:08:35.398
of murdering you with my bare hands many nights.

03:08:38.530 --> 03:08:40.830
So I hope it's not just flowery language

03:08:40.830 --> 03:08:45.198
you are throwing around the dinner table, Master Ikithon.

03:08:49.550 --> 03:08:54.550
This place, this country could do better.

03:09:00.000 --> 03:09:02.000
It could do it with a little less blood.

03:09:04.790 --> 03:09:06.730
Everyone at this table knows that struggle

03:09:06.730 --> 03:09:08.823
is inherent to life.

03:09:15.050 --> 03:09:16.863
But this way is not the only way.

03:09:19.610 --> 03:09:22.113
That was given to Astrid.

03:09:31.029 --> 03:09:32.479
MATT: She looks at Trent.

03:09:38.119 --> 03:09:39.185
"Then,

03:09:41.589 --> 03:09:42.939
"take care of yourself,

03:09:45.759 --> 03:09:46.917
"all of you,

03:09:49.673 --> 03:09:51.584
"for the struggle never stops.

03:09:53.449 --> 03:09:55.069
"And because you don't want bloodshed,

03:09:55.069 --> 03:09:57.869
"doesn't mean every other person

03:09:57.869 --> 03:09:59.769
"that wants what you have doesn't.

03:10:06.979 --> 03:10:08.682
"History and mortal nature,

03:10:10.399 --> 03:10:12.275
"prove this time and time again.

03:10:15.709 --> 03:10:20.233
"If you are not sometimes the first to cut,

03:10:20.233 --> 03:10:22.975
"you are the first to receive the blade.

03:10:28.149 --> 03:10:31.041
"I've spent my life baring knives.

03:10:37.859 --> 03:10:41.936
"Let's hope you live as long, Caleb Widogast."

03:10:50.768 --> 03:10:53.369
MARISHA: I take a bite of my steak.

03:10:53.369 --> 03:10:54.614
Is it poisoned?

03:10:57.584 --> 03:10:58.909
MATT: It's very well prepared.

03:11:00.259 --> 03:11:01.265
MARISHA: Jester.

03:11:01.265 --> 03:11:03.709
MATT: It does not appear to be poisoned.

03:11:03.709 --> 03:11:06.589
MARISHA: It might be the best steak
I've ever had in my life.

03:11:06.589 --> 03:11:08.971
LAURA: Really?
MARISHA: It's so fucking good.

03:11:08.971 --> 03:11:11.117
It's melting in my mouth.

03:11:13.554 --> 03:11:15.453
Yeah, yeah, yeah, just eat as much as you can real fast--

03:11:15.453 --> 03:11:17.561
LAURA: Before he kicks us out?
MARISHA: Get kicked out, yeah.

03:11:20.494 --> 03:11:23.384
LIAM: I feel like I have been domineering the conversation.

03:11:23.384 --> 03:11:25.684
LAURA: What?! No!
SAM: No.

03:11:25.684 --> 03:11:28.292
LAURA: Not at all.
SAM: It's been great.

03:11:28.292 --> 03:11:32.416
LIAM: Does anyone else have any questions

03:11:32.416 --> 03:11:33.890
about me being...

03:11:35.166 --> 03:11:36.565
groomed as the antichrist?

03:11:36.565 --> 03:11:38.399
(laughter)

03:11:38.399 --> 03:11:40.390
TRAVIS: How many more beacons do you have?

03:11:40.390 --> 03:11:42.859
LAURA: (laughing into fake coughing)

03:11:42.859 --> 03:11:43.942
LIAM: There you go.

03:11:46.424 --> 03:11:48.449
MATT: "What do you mean?
You've only seen the one.

03:11:49.918 --> 03:11:51.869
"That is what we have."

03:11:51.869 --> 03:11:53.409
TALIESIN: Insight check.
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:11:53.409 --> 03:11:54.509
MATT: Go for it.

03:11:55.979 --> 03:11:56.812
LIAM: Natural 20.

03:11:56.812 --> 03:11:57.756
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

03:11:57.756 --> 03:12:00.248
ALL: (yelling)

03:12:00.248 --> 03:12:02.979
TRAVIS: (machine whirring and firing)

03:12:02.979 --> 03:12:05.135
MATT: Bringing you to a total of...?

03:12:05.135 --> 03:12:06.698
LAURA: 40, that's 40.

03:12:06.698 --> 03:12:08.292
LIAM: Well, 29 on my end.

03:12:08.292 --> 03:12:09.622
TALIESIN: 30.

03:12:09.622 --> 03:12:12.339
MARISHA: So... 59.

03:12:12.339 --> 03:12:13.602
MATT: Well, not combined.

03:12:13.602 --> 03:12:16.079
(laughing)
SAM: Yeah, they stack. They stack.

03:12:16.079 --> 03:12:18.549
MATT: That's how it works.
ASHLEY: Yeah, you combine them now.

03:12:18.549 --> 03:12:22.789
MARISHA: How many there are, the
addresses in which they're located.

03:12:22.789 --> 03:12:23.821
TALIESIN: His eyes dart to the left.

03:12:23.821 --> 03:12:25.939
"It's due south, go!"
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:12:25.939 --> 03:12:27.449
MATT: Since you're both here--

03:12:27.449 --> 03:12:30.074
LIAM: It's right under the table!
LAURA: Yes!

03:12:31.129 --> 03:12:33.869
MATT: He's being completely honest.

03:12:33.869 --> 03:12:35.019
LAURA: He's always honest.

03:12:35.019 --> 03:12:37.659
MARISHA: I hate that-- the best liars are honest.

03:12:39.225 --> 03:12:42.241
TRAVIS: What's the most incredible
thing you've learned from studying them?

03:12:45.484 --> 03:12:46.718
MATT: "We don't know yet."

03:12:49.119 --> 03:12:49.952
TRAVIS: Yet?

03:12:51.289 --> 03:12:53.689
TALIESIN: Have you ever answered a question directly?

03:12:56.989 --> 03:12:59.449
MATT: "One question at a time."

03:12:59.449 --> 03:13:00.679
TALIESIN: I knew it.

03:13:00.679 --> 03:13:01.512
That's great.

03:13:03.770 --> 03:13:05.796
LAURA: It's like a party game, really.

03:13:07.059 --> 03:13:08.539
MATT: "We have learned some things,

03:13:08.539 --> 03:13:10.781
"but there is still much more to glean.

03:13:10.781 --> 03:13:13.479
"We have only just begun our research.

03:13:13.479 --> 03:13:17.184
"So who's to say what the most important thing is.

03:13:18.799 --> 03:13:23.189
"What I do know there is much potential to help a lot

03:13:23.189 --> 03:13:24.465
"of good people."

03:13:32.599 --> 03:13:36.806
MARISHA: You mentioned being a tomb raider in Shattengrod.

03:13:36.806 --> 03:13:39.011
Is that a mission you've sent people on?

03:13:39.011 --> 03:13:40.509
MATT: "No, but it sounds like the sort of thing

03:13:40.509 --> 03:13:43.049
"that Vess would definitely go for."

03:13:43.049 --> 03:13:44.629
MARISHA: Interesting.

03:13:44.629 --> 03:13:49.249
MATT: "Her interests tend to lie in things

03:13:49.249 --> 03:13:51.609
"around the forgotten history."

03:13:51.609 --> 03:13:53.899
MARISHA: Isn't that kind of like her title?

03:13:53.899 --> 03:13:55.069
MATT: She's the Archmage of Antiquity.

03:13:55.069 --> 03:13:56.924
MARISHA: Yeah, that's her thing. Right?

03:13:56.924 --> 03:13:58.593
That's, like, what she's supposed to do?

03:13:58.593 --> 03:13:59.893
TALIESIN: It's, like, in the name.
TRAVIS: (laughs)

03:14:03.499 --> 03:14:07.369
MARISHA: Have you come across any interesting artifacts?

03:14:07.369 --> 03:14:08.202
MATT: "In my life?"

03:14:08.202 --> 03:14:10.209
MARISHA: Things she's dug up recently?

03:14:10.209 --> 03:14:13.919
Anything pre-Calamity sound familiar?

03:14:13.919 --> 03:14:17.164
Anything related to the Eyes of Nine?

03:14:18.589 --> 03:14:22.029
MATT: "I have not, but if you've seen such a thing,

03:14:22.029 --> 03:14:23.639
"please do tell me.

03:14:23.639 --> 03:14:27.039
"Vess tends to be very secretive with her business."

03:14:27.039 --> 03:14:28.906
MARISHA: Oh, this has nothing to do with her.

03:14:30.969 --> 03:14:33.279
This is something we've all been, like,

03:14:33.279 --> 03:14:35.497
like a side hobby, you know.

03:14:38.459 --> 03:14:42.187
MATT: "I do not believe I have,

03:14:42.187 --> 03:14:43.753
"but I am curious."
MARISHA: Have a side hobby?

03:14:43.753 --> 03:14:45.611
You should have a side hobby.

03:14:45.611 --> 03:14:47.559
MATT: "-- heard anything about this artifact

03:14:47.559 --> 03:14:51.011
"or Eyes of Nine you speak of."

03:14:51.011 --> 03:14:52.959
MARISHA: Worth a shot.

03:14:52.959 --> 03:14:56.819
Origami is very-- you know, you could probably--

03:14:56.819 --> 03:14:59.249
the mental health aspect of just having something

03:14:59.249 --> 03:15:03.169
that's not intrinsically related to your work, you know.

03:15:03.169 --> 03:15:05.029
You should-- you should get a hobby.

03:15:05.029 --> 03:15:06.179
LIAM: He has a hobby.

03:15:07.559 --> 03:15:08.867
He's a sculptor.

03:15:11.926 --> 03:15:13.067
MATT: "In a way."

03:15:16.869 --> 03:15:18.861
TRAVIS: The trees outside your windows.

03:15:20.799 --> 03:15:22.199
What is that supposed to be?

03:15:23.529 --> 03:15:25.829
MATT: "I just wanted to provide a...

03:15:27.645 --> 03:15:29.259
"gentle atmosphere.

03:15:29.259 --> 03:15:32.239
Do you not like it?
I can change it for you.

03:15:32.239 --> 03:15:33.159
TRAVIS: I would love that.

03:15:33.159 --> 03:15:35.999
LAURA: Ooh!
MATT: "What would you prefer?"

03:15:35.999 --> 03:15:37.272
TRAVIS: Coastal view.

03:15:38.189 --> 03:15:40.949
MATT: Without him moving or even looking away,

03:15:40.949 --> 03:15:43.189
you watch as all the windows shift

03:15:43.189 --> 03:15:46.679
into a moonlit oceanside night

03:15:46.679 --> 03:15:48.719
and you can see waves just breaking

03:15:48.719 --> 03:15:52.579
against the sides of the ocean beaches.

03:15:52.579 --> 03:15:56.439
LAURA: Is it ocean on both sides or is it ocean on one side?

03:15:56.439 --> 03:15:58.733
MATT: It looks like it's ocean
on one side and then it curves around

03:15:58.733 --> 03:16:00.561
and you begin to see the coast on the other.

03:16:00.561 --> 03:16:02.865
LAURA: Cool.
MATT: Like you're right on a cliff.

03:16:02.865 --> 03:16:05.515
TRAVIS: Dope, dope, dee-dope.
LAURA: That's neat.

03:16:05.515 --> 03:16:07.216
MATT: "Any other parlor tricks you would wish

03:16:07.216 --> 03:16:10.736
"to ask of an archmage of the Cerberus Assembly?"

03:16:10.736 --> 03:16:13.389
SAM: Nope, no parlor tricks, but I had actually a question.

03:16:13.389 --> 03:16:17.949
If you don't mind, Caleb, about your past.

03:16:18.899 --> 03:16:22.589
You know, thank you so much for sending him

03:16:22.589 --> 03:16:25.142
to us in your weird psycho way.

03:16:25.989 --> 03:16:29.005
But we do appreciate making his acquaintance,

03:16:29.005 --> 03:16:34.005
however dark and creepy the origins were.

03:16:34.179 --> 03:16:38.020
But you know, you-- I think if

03:16:38.020 --> 03:16:40.859
my memory serves, he was sort of locked up,

03:16:40.859 --> 03:16:45.062
locked away for a while in a pla-- in a bad place.

03:16:46.149 --> 03:16:47.889
He would have stayed there forever, right

03:16:47.889 --> 03:16:50.742
if someone hadn't freed him?

03:16:51.689 --> 03:16:53.029
MATT: "Most likely, yes."

03:16:53.029 --> 03:16:54.267
SAM: Who freed him?

03:16:55.339 --> 03:16:56.430
MATT: "Well,

03:16:57.291 --> 03:16:58.765
"who do you think freed him?"

03:16:58.765 --> 03:17:00.398
And he gestures over towards the symbol

03:17:00.398 --> 03:17:03.007
on the table that was given to Caleb earlier.

03:17:07.609 --> 03:17:08.442
SAM: What?

03:17:12.114 --> 03:17:16.029
LIAM: What he's saying saying is that he orchestrated it.

03:17:16.029 --> 03:17:18.363
LAURA: So he imprisoned you <i>and</i> he freed you.

03:17:18.363 --> 03:17:20.030
LIAM: He left me shut off

03:17:20.030 --> 03:17:23.162
and then he turned the lights back on.

03:17:24.929 --> 03:17:27.060
LAURA: Wow.
SAM: It's weird.

03:17:27.060 --> 03:17:29.682
LAURA: That's very kind of you.

03:17:29.682 --> 03:17:31.290
MATT: "Thank you."
LAURA: Mm.

03:17:33.369 --> 03:17:34.650
Very generous.

03:17:38.959 --> 03:17:40.789
LIAM: Didn't need those 10 years.

03:17:41.999 --> 03:17:43.859
How is this going?

03:17:49.223 --> 03:17:50.348
MATT: "Eadwulf."

03:17:52.951 --> 03:17:55.201
Eadwulf leans back,

03:17:56.269 --> 03:17:59.485
pulls back his sleeves and you can see

03:17:59.485 --> 03:18:04.118
the clustered maze-like tattoos
that are across his forearms.

03:18:05.149 --> 03:18:08.479
And you can see similar scars as to the ones that Caleb had

03:18:08.479 --> 03:18:11.349
with raised areas of the skin,

03:18:11.349 --> 03:18:15.357
where things are embedded beneath and have healed over.

03:18:16.857 --> 03:18:18.507
And he goes,

03:18:18.507 --> 03:18:20.915
"It's come in quite handy, to be honest.

03:18:21.899 --> 03:18:22.991
LAURA: Does that hurt?

03:18:24.378 --> 03:18:25.711
MATT: "Only a little, at the beginning.

03:18:27.239 --> 03:18:30.884
"But it much more hurts the person on the other side."

03:18:30.884 --> 03:18:33.539
And he tenses his arms and as he does,

03:18:33.539 --> 03:18:37.612
you see energy spark through and arc up the arm.

03:18:38.979 --> 03:18:41.680
LAURA: You're like a living magical weapon?

03:18:45.299 --> 03:18:46.739
MATT: "I like that title.

03:18:46.739 --> 03:18:48.939
"Living magical weapon."

03:18:48.939 --> 03:18:52.289
MATT: Are his forearms still as amazing as they always were?

03:18:52.289 --> 03:18:53.819
MATT: Yeah, they're more so.

03:18:53.819 --> 03:18:55.700
More so. He's a fit fucker.

03:18:55.700 --> 03:18:56.533
LIAM: Yeah.

03:18:59.152 --> 03:19:01.285
MATT: He takes a little drink and...

03:19:02.635 --> 03:19:03.918
nods to you.

03:19:05.249 --> 03:19:07.732
LIAM: I look over at Astrid.
What about you?

03:19:11.069 --> 03:19:14.390
MATT: "They have come in handy a number of times, yes.

03:19:17.389 --> 03:19:19.519
"But do I require to give a presentation as well?"

03:19:19.519 --> 03:19:22.219
She pulls her sleeves back and shows the same tattoos.

03:19:27.259 --> 03:19:31.279
TRAVIS: You've talked about Caleb replacing you.

03:19:31.279 --> 03:19:33.919
Forgive me, I am so forgetful.

03:19:33.919 --> 03:19:34.939
What's wrong with you?

03:19:34.939 --> 03:19:35.939
Where are you going?

03:19:40.369 --> 03:19:42.310
MATT: "Well, nowhere, if he fails."

03:19:45.899 --> 03:19:47.109
TRAVIS: Nowhere?

03:19:47.109 --> 03:19:48.972
You don't feel ill?

03:19:54.139 --> 03:19:57.291
MATT: "I take it from the tone of your inquiry

03:19:58.519 --> 03:20:01.519
"that you don't seem to understand the...

03:20:03.235 --> 03:20:05.849
"structure of the Cerberus Assembly."

03:20:05.849 --> 03:20:07.079
TRAVIS: I don't.

03:20:07.079 --> 03:20:09.079
Although I did look up to it when I was younger.

03:20:09.079 --> 03:20:10.359
I was very curious.

03:20:10.359 --> 03:20:13.067
I'm sad to report I haven't learned much since then.

03:20:15.909 --> 03:20:19.864
MATT: "Membership is only given
when a member has stepped down,

03:20:19.864 --> 03:20:21.939
"kicked out or passes away."

03:20:25.039 --> 03:20:29.269
TRAVIS: And do you plan to step down, get kicked out or...

03:20:32.277 --> 03:20:33.605
MATT: "Hopefully, not any.

03:20:35.389 --> 03:20:36.872
"I like where I am.

03:20:38.579 --> 03:20:40.784
"It has served me well for a very long time.

03:20:46.509 --> 03:20:48.657
LIAM: It's a very generous offer.

03:20:50.049 --> 03:20:52.874
I take it very seriously, truly.

03:20:57.229 --> 03:20:58.942
What if I decide to walk away?

03:21:00.269 --> 03:21:04.312
What if I want to be a sailor instead?

03:21:05.403 --> 03:21:06.586
MATT: "That is your choice."

03:21:08.019 --> 03:21:09.179
LIAM: Easy as that?

03:21:09.179 --> 03:21:10.395
MATT: "Of course.

03:21:12.849 --> 03:21:14.090
"But you won't."

03:21:21.969 --> 03:21:22.802
LIAM: No.

03:21:24.389 --> 03:21:25.939
No, I won't be a sailor.

03:21:31.189 --> 03:21:33.682
TALIESIN: What a shame, you make a fine sailor.

03:21:33.682 --> 03:21:35.188
SAM: He really does not.

03:21:35.188 --> 03:21:36.242
TALIESIN: The world would lose one.

03:21:36.242 --> 03:21:37.875
SAM: Terrible at sailing!

03:21:40.979 --> 03:21:42.629
LIAM: This has been very informative.

03:21:44.229 --> 03:21:45.062
Illuminating.

03:21:47.889 --> 03:21:49.889
I don't wish to overstay our welcome.

03:21:49.889 --> 03:21:52.326
We do have business to attend to

03:21:52.326 --> 03:21:54.192
and preparations to make.

03:21:54.192 --> 03:21:55.233
LAURA: Mm-hm.

03:21:56.169 --> 03:21:59.632
MATT: "Well, regardless, it has been
a pleasure to get to see all of you.

03:21:59.632 --> 03:22:03.872
"Thank you for accepting our invitation and for this...

03:22:04.839 --> 03:22:06.709
"quaint bit of conversation."

03:22:06.709 --> 03:22:08.379
LAURA: Thank you for the delicious steak.

03:22:08.379 --> 03:22:12.341
It was really one of the best I've ever had.

03:22:12.341 --> 03:22:16.975
MATT: "Well, I will let the staff know posthaste.

03:22:18.999 --> 03:22:20.107
"Thank you.

03:22:21.289 --> 03:22:22.820
"I will take my leave."

03:22:23.809 --> 03:22:25.292
TALIESIN: May I say, before you go:

03:22:27.719 --> 03:22:32.599
I think perhaps you are one of the most powerful mages

03:22:32.599 --> 03:22:36.442
that I've ever had the pleasure to be in the presence of.

03:22:38.369 --> 03:22:42.101
And for this, I would offer a gift.

03:22:42.101 --> 03:22:46.259
I think it has been a long time since anyone has pointed out

03:22:46.259 --> 03:22:48.059
to you that you're a fool.

03:22:49.509 --> 03:22:51.059
Pain doesn't make people,

03:22:52.299 --> 03:22:54.769
it's love that makes people.

03:22:54.769 --> 03:22:56.742
The pain is inconsequential.

03:22:57.879 --> 03:23:00.109
It's love that saves them.

03:23:00.109 --> 03:23:01.919
And you would know that, but you have none around you.

03:23:01.919 --> 03:23:03.149
You said so yourself,

03:23:03.149 --> 03:23:06.494
you surround yourself with lies and deceptions.

03:23:06.494 --> 03:23:09.352
And I wish for you, in the future,

03:23:10.309 --> 03:23:12.892
to find someone who will mourn you when you are gone.

03:23:15.779 --> 03:23:17.012
Respectfully.

03:23:23.929 --> 03:23:24.970
MATT: "Good night."

03:23:26.392 --> 03:23:27.640
And he vanishes.

03:23:28.623 --> 03:23:31.760
MARISHA: (whispers) Caduceus.
TALIESIN: That was so tasty.

03:23:31.760 --> 03:23:34.094
LAURA: Ooh!
MATT: Astrid and Eadwulf are just like--

03:23:35.134 --> 03:23:37.679
TRAVIS: Yo.
TALIESIN: You're welcome.

03:23:37.679 --> 03:23:39.304
LAURA: Wow!
MARISHA: Cad burn.

03:23:39.304 --> 03:23:41.904
MATT: Eadwulf takes his napkin--

03:23:42.960 --> 03:23:43.793
"Um--"

03:23:44.923 --> 03:23:47.384
LAURA: You guys want to hang out or something?
You want to go grab a drink?

03:23:47.384 --> 03:23:49.617
LIAM: I was to ask the same thing.

03:23:49.617 --> 03:23:51.209
Why don't we get out of here?

03:23:51.209 --> 03:23:53.634
MATT: "No, I have--

03:23:53.634 --> 03:23:56.689
"I have some business I have to attend to."
LAURA: Come on! Hang out with us!

03:23:56.689 --> 03:23:58.059
MATT: "Mm."

03:23:58.059 --> 03:24:00.149
TALIESIN: The invitation's always open.

03:24:00.149 --> 03:24:04.049
MATT: And he begins to leave
the chamber as Astrid stands up.

03:24:04.049 --> 03:24:07.089
LIAM: What if you just walked us
a block or two away from the tower?

03:24:07.089 --> 03:24:08.247
TALIESIN: Please.

03:24:10.119 --> 03:24:12.002
LAURA: It'll be fun.
MATT: He looks back at Astrid.

03:24:16.043 --> 03:24:18.619
MATT: "We'll walk you beyond the courtyard, yes?"

03:24:18.619 --> 03:24:19.777
LIAM: Astrid.

03:24:22.679 --> 03:24:25.117
MATT: "Just to make sure you
safely make it off the grounds."

03:24:28.845 --> 03:24:32.129
And they escort you back to the central chamber.

03:24:34.469 --> 03:24:36.902
Proceed down to the base of the tower.

03:24:39.659 --> 03:24:41.642
You do not jump this time because that would hurt.

03:24:44.459 --> 03:24:46.799
LAURA: I bend my knees so they're like (exclaims).

03:24:49.089 --> 03:24:50.489
MATT: The door is opened and they lead you

03:24:50.489 --> 03:24:52.597
back into the courtyard and you step out.

03:24:52.597 --> 03:24:55.672
You can hear the crickets in the nearby oak trees

03:24:55.672 --> 03:24:57.122
making their evening noise.

03:24:57.122 --> 03:25:01.088
LAURA: I want to thread my arm
through Astrid's as we're walking.

03:25:01.088 --> 03:25:02.369
MATT: She tenses a bit.

03:25:02.369 --> 03:25:05.383
You hear the owl nearby going-- (hooting)

03:25:06.227 --> 03:25:07.573
You all continue to walk.

03:25:07.573 --> 03:25:10.309
(laughter)

03:25:10.309 --> 03:25:11.359
LIAM: Reflex.

03:25:14.819 --> 03:25:17.269
LAURA: I'm going to whisper over to her as we're walking.

03:25:18.569 --> 03:25:21.986
I'm sorry if you thought I
was giving you a hard time earlier.

03:25:23.245 --> 03:25:26.059
I thought maybe you were really mean like Trent,

03:25:26.059 --> 03:25:28.219
but now I'm feeling really guilty about it

03:25:28.219 --> 03:25:30.129
because I don't think you are.

03:25:30.129 --> 03:25:33.929
So I want to apologize if I came across as rude.

03:25:33.929 --> 03:25:35.982
I feel very bad about it.

03:25:37.479 --> 03:25:40.839
MATT: She doesn't necessarily lean back,

03:25:40.839 --> 03:25:43.869
but then speaks quietly towards your direction.

03:25:43.869 --> 03:25:45.979
"You don't know anything about me."

03:25:45.979 --> 03:25:47.629
LAURA: No.

03:25:47.629 --> 03:25:49.779
MATT: "You do not know what I've done."

03:25:49.779 --> 03:25:52.569
LAURA: Well, I know some of what you've done,

03:25:52.569 --> 03:25:54.719
and I know that Caleb cares deeply for you,

03:25:54.719 --> 03:25:57.434
so you can't be all bad.

03:26:02.379 --> 03:26:03.537
MATT: No response.

03:26:06.860 --> 03:26:08.479
You watch as Eadwulf

03:26:08.479 --> 03:26:10.269
as he's walking along flicks his wrist,

03:26:10.269 --> 03:26:13.069
and you watch as he pulls out of the air

03:26:13.069 --> 03:26:15.637
a bottle of some sort of a dark liquor

03:26:15.637 --> 03:26:19.187
and he uncorks it, takes a swig.

03:26:21.029 --> 03:26:22.756
ASHLEY: That's a handy trick.

03:26:22.756 --> 03:26:25.056
MATT: "Oh, I've got plenty of them, don't worry."

03:26:26.069 --> 03:26:27.559
ASHLEY: I'd love to see more.

03:26:27.559 --> 03:26:29.449
MATT: "Would you?"

03:26:29.449 --> 03:26:30.282
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:26:31.659 --> 03:26:33.509
LIAM: I pass the bottle over to Astrid.

03:26:33.509 --> 03:26:34.459
MATT: Okay.

03:26:40.299 --> 03:26:43.662
MATT: Hands it over to Eadwulf, takes it, corks it,

03:26:45.506 --> 03:26:46.739
and it vanishes.

03:26:49.999 --> 03:26:51.249
LIAM: You could come with us.

03:26:52.865 --> 03:26:54.972
You <i>could</i>, you could.

03:26:54.972 --> 03:26:56.267
MATT: "No, I could not."

03:27:00.735 --> 03:27:02.510
LIAM: Well...

03:27:02.510 --> 03:27:05.194
maybe we both have some thinking to do.

03:27:09.109 --> 03:27:09.942
MATT: "Maybe."

03:27:12.855 --> 03:27:15.377
LAURA: Are you talking to Astrid or Eadwulf at this point?

03:27:15.377 --> 03:27:16.945
LIAM: Sure.
MATT: He's talking to Astrid.

03:27:16.945 --> 03:27:19.462
LAURA: Okay. Just making sure.

03:27:25.429 --> 03:27:28.591
LIAM: We'll be out of the city soon.

03:27:28.591 --> 03:27:30.166
I don't know when we'll be back.

03:27:34.689 --> 03:27:35.904
MATT: "Just be careful.

03:27:37.249 --> 03:27:39.229
"I'm sorry I can't be of more help."

03:27:39.229 --> 03:27:41.399
Her eyes dart up

03:27:41.399 --> 03:27:44.601
towards the trees above, you hear again the--

03:27:44.601 --> 03:27:47.057
(hooting)

03:27:48.449 --> 03:27:52.007
LAURA: Oh, he's-- he's an owl now, I get it.

03:27:54.203 --> 03:27:56.972
SAM: We can kidnap you, make it look like a real struggle.

03:27:58.450 --> 03:28:00.700
MARISHA: (laughs)

03:28:01.709 --> 03:28:03.659
MATT: She actually smiles at that and goes,

03:28:07.899 --> 03:28:09.720
"I appreciate the candor."

03:28:10.959 --> 03:28:15.349
As you guys reach the gates that lead off the estate itself

03:28:15.349 --> 03:28:16.872
Eadwulf pushes it open.

03:28:20.289 --> 03:28:23.222
"That was certainly one of the
more interesting dinners I've been to.

03:28:28.048 --> 03:28:29.019
"I like you."

03:28:29.019 --> 03:28:30.419
TALIESIN: Thank you, I like you, too.

03:28:33.659 --> 03:28:36.259
Don't let that stuff get to your head.

03:28:36.259 --> 03:28:39.631
He's-- that guy's a little-- oof.
MATT: "Yeah."

03:28:39.631 --> 03:28:41.698
(laughter)

03:28:42.679 --> 03:28:45.481
MATT: "I would be careful not to
say things to people like him."

03:28:45.481 --> 03:28:47.681
TALIESIN: Oh no, I wouldn't if I had to live here, no.

03:28:51.777 --> 03:28:52.759
Woof.

03:28:52.759 --> 03:28:54.167
MARISHA: "If I had to live here."

03:28:57.379 --> 03:28:58.212
MATT: "Anyway."

03:28:59.094 --> 03:29:00.582
You see that he's about to say
something to Caduceus and he,

03:29:00.582 --> 03:29:02.782
"Anyway.

03:29:02.782 --> 03:29:04.552
"Astrid."
LIAM: Good spending time.

03:29:06.209 --> 03:29:08.459
"I'm sure we'll cross paths again,"

03:29:08.459 --> 03:29:10.609
and he puts his hand on your shoulder.

03:29:12.999 --> 03:29:15.099
"She keeps bringing us together."

03:29:21.512 --> 03:29:22.969
And he walks on.

03:29:22.969 --> 03:29:27.689
LIAM: Does he have any marks of the Matron on him anywhere?

03:29:27.689 --> 03:29:31.109
MATT: Passive perception on Caleb, no marks on him,

03:29:31.109 --> 03:29:33.454
but you do catch as he was leaning forward,

03:29:33.454 --> 03:29:35.696
touching your shoulder, there is a flash of a

03:29:35.696 --> 03:29:40.360
small, silver pendant of a raven feather.

03:29:42.679 --> 03:29:43.979
LIAM: There's your multiclass.

03:29:49.119 --> 03:29:51.629
MATT: Astrid lingers for a moment.

03:29:51.629 --> 03:29:53.289
LAURA: Oh, oh, oh!

03:29:53.289 --> 03:29:54.849
I'm going to use Disguise Self,

03:29:54.849 --> 03:29:58.425
and I'm going to make my hair very long,
about down to here.

03:29:58.425 --> 03:30:00.789
(laughter)

03:30:00.789 --> 03:30:02.684
MATT: "See, you can do it.

03:30:02.684 --> 03:30:04.386
"There's no worries to have."

03:30:04.386 --> 03:30:06.089
LAURA: It's pretty great, yeah,

03:30:06.089 --> 03:30:08.176
but I want to be able to do like, you know,

03:30:08.176 --> 03:30:10.382
and actually make it move.

03:30:10.382 --> 03:30:12.779
MATT: "Well, give it time."

03:30:12.779 --> 03:30:13.612
LAURA: Okay.

03:30:17.009 --> 03:30:19.732
MARISHA: You sure you don't want to come
get a drink with us?

03:30:20.619 --> 03:30:25.412
Now that the walking road pylon has left.

03:30:30.585 --> 03:30:32.285
MATT: "I appreciate the offer.

03:30:34.851 --> 03:30:36.384
"But I should not."

03:30:39.249 --> 03:30:42.408
TRAVIS: Funny that he let Caleb go and not you.

03:30:43.670 --> 03:30:46.245
Strange, don't you think?
MATT: "Hm?"

03:30:47.414 --> 03:30:52.047
TRAVIS: Isn't it funny that he let Caleb go and not you?

03:30:54.719 --> 03:30:55.902
Seems...

03:30:57.319 --> 03:30:58.152
odd.

03:30:59.039 --> 03:31:02.220
MATT: "Caleb was always his favorite. Bren."

03:31:08.279 --> 03:31:09.487
LIAM: (unaccented) Well...

03:31:11.129 --> 03:31:12.845
you were always mine.

03:31:17.149 --> 03:31:19.565
MATT: (unaccented) "You mean what you said in there, right?

03:31:23.319 --> 03:31:24.152
"To stop him."

03:31:26.401 --> 03:31:27.619
LIAM: I cannot hear.
MATT: Sorry.

03:31:27.619 --> 03:31:28.752
LIAM: I'm sorry.

03:31:29.799 --> 03:31:32.647
MATT: "You mean what you said in there, to stop him?"

03:31:39.399 --> 03:31:40.474
LIAM: <i>Ja.</i>

03:31:41.707 --> 03:31:43.919
Nothing is set in stone.

03:31:43.919 --> 03:31:45.695
Not for you or anyone.

03:31:51.269 --> 03:31:52.719
MATT: "Race you to the top."

03:31:54.019 --> 03:31:57.025
And she turns and heads back into the courtyard.

03:32:05.934 --> 03:32:07.684
LAURA: Are you okay, Caleb?

03:32:09.749 --> 03:32:12.032
MARISHA: Let's-- let's get away from here.

03:32:13.919 --> 03:32:15.511
Let's get a little bit away.

03:32:17.679 --> 03:32:19.852
LIAM: Stares at the tower for a moment.

03:32:21.379 --> 03:32:22.212
Okay.

03:32:23.309 --> 03:32:24.369
MARISHA: Yeah?

03:32:24.369 --> 03:32:25.202
LIAM: Yeah.

03:32:26.862 --> 03:32:28.272
TRAVIS: Where's that fucking owl?

03:32:28.272 --> 03:32:30.049
MARISHA: I know, fuck that.
LAURA: I keep my eyes out for any owls--

03:32:30.049 --> 03:32:31.751
MARISHA: You still have that pistol, yeah?

03:32:31.751 --> 03:32:32.584
SAM: Yeah.

03:32:32.584 --> 03:32:35.320
MARISHA: It's fucking owl season.
SAM: Want me to just start shooting?

03:32:35.320 --> 03:32:38.079
(laughter)

03:32:38.079 --> 03:32:40.181
TRAVIS: All the wizards come out and kill us.

03:32:40.181 --> 03:32:41.959
MATT: Nothing really draws attention

03:32:41.959 --> 03:32:45.134
in the middle of you know, the most wealthy,
magical district, in the greatest--

03:32:45.134 --> 03:32:46.039
TRAVIS: (screaming)

03:32:46.039 --> 03:32:48.759
MATT: -- the capital city than just a bunch of rapid gunfire

03:32:48.759 --> 03:32:51.014
in the middle of a courtyard.

03:32:51.014 --> 03:32:54.202
TALIESIN: Seven people running from a swarm of owls.

03:32:54.202 --> 03:32:56.378
(laughter)

03:32:59.829 --> 03:33:01.129
SAM: Well, we didn't die.

03:33:01.129 --> 03:33:02.449
We didn't fight.

03:33:02.449 --> 03:33:04.132
LIAM: No.
SAM: Just had dinner.

03:33:04.132 --> 03:33:06.199
That's good. Right?

03:33:06.199 --> 03:33:09.439
LIAM: It was good, the steak was outstanding.

03:33:09.439 --> 03:33:11.680
MARISHA: Oh my god, it was so good.
It was the best, I mean--

03:33:11.680 --> 03:33:13.571
ASHLEY: I didn't eat.
TRAVIS: I didn't either.

03:33:13.571 --> 03:33:15.271
ASHLEY: I'm starving.

03:33:15.271 --> 03:33:17.439
MARISHA: Let's go-- let's find a dive bar.

03:33:17.439 --> 03:33:20.306
ASHLEY: I'm mad I didn't try it,
but just out of principle

03:33:20.306 --> 03:33:22.339
I didn't want to touch anything.

03:33:22.339 --> 03:33:24.359
LAURA: I get that, I totally get that.

03:33:24.359 --> 03:33:28.236
I feel like out of principle, I wanted to touch it all.

03:33:28.236 --> 03:33:30.004
ASHLEY: Yeah, I get it, I get it.

03:33:30.004 --> 03:33:31.996
TRAVIS: He looked sickly, right?

03:33:31.996 --> 03:33:34.009
Has he always looked like that?

03:33:34.009 --> 03:33:36.119
MARISHA: I feel like he's always looked like shit,

03:33:36.119 --> 03:33:39.449
but he did look particularly sickly, right?

03:33:39.449 --> 03:33:44.389
LIAM: He had a little more vigor in my youth, but not much.

03:33:44.389 --> 03:33:45.222
TALIESIN: Gaunt.

03:33:45.222 --> 03:33:48.709
MATT: Yeah, nothing different than
last time you encountered him.

03:33:48.709 --> 03:33:53.505
He just in generally has that
sort of Mr. Burns complexion about him.

03:33:53.505 --> 03:33:54.338
(laughs)

03:33:54.338 --> 03:33:56.955
TRAVIS: All right, fair.
LAURA: Okay.

03:33:58.404 --> 03:34:00.737
ASHLEY: Do you know how old he is?

03:34:02.249 --> 03:34:05.399
LIAM: Well, unless he has pulled the wool over my eyes

03:34:05.399 --> 03:34:08.082
in another way, he's in his late seventies.

03:34:08.082 --> 03:34:09.740
MATT: Late seventies, yeah.

03:34:12.006 --> 03:34:13.520
MARISHA: He needs to take a hint from the ladies

03:34:13.520 --> 03:34:15.420
and use some of those glamours.

03:34:18.489 --> 03:34:19.790
Let's get out of the Shimmer Ward.

03:34:19.790 --> 03:34:21.512
I don't want to have a drink in the Shimmer Ward.

03:34:23.259 --> 03:34:24.899
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:34:24.899 --> 03:34:28.289
LAURA: Caleb, I'm really sorry that I made a comment

03:34:28.289 --> 03:34:30.040
about Astrid's haircut.

03:34:31.640 --> 03:34:32.473
LIAM: Oh.

03:34:33.759 --> 03:34:35.339
LAURA: I was trying to be shitty.
LIAM: I--

03:34:35.339 --> 03:34:38.547
LAURA: And that's-- that was a horrible thing to do.

03:34:38.547 --> 03:34:40.264
SAM: I thought you complimented her.

03:34:40.264 --> 03:34:44.064
LAURA: Yeah, but I did it in that girl way
where I was being a shithead about it.

03:34:44.064 --> 03:34:46.830
SAM: You were being a mean girl?
LAURA: I was being a mean girl.

03:34:46.830 --> 03:34:49.469
SAM: Yeah, that's not cool. That's never cool.

03:34:49.469 --> 03:34:51.219
TRAVIS: It sounded like you were complimenting her.

03:34:51.219 --> 03:34:53.059
MARISHA: Oh, that was totally code for mean girl.

03:34:53.059 --> 03:34:55.689
Like, "Your hair is really cute."

03:34:55.689 --> 03:34:57.064
LAURA: It was so mean.

03:34:57.064 --> 03:34:59.299
MARISHA: That's code for like,
"What the fuck are you doing?"

03:34:59.299 --> 03:35:00.889
LAURA: That's how the girls used to talk to <i>me</i>

03:35:00.889 --> 03:35:02.431
when I was outside.

03:35:02.431 --> 03:35:03.942
I don't know why I did it.

03:35:03.942 --> 03:35:05.789
TALIESIN: Well, we all learn it somewhere, I guess.

03:35:05.789 --> 03:35:08.302
Was that really mean, "Your hair is cute"?

03:35:08.302 --> 03:35:10.237
MARISHA: Depends on how you say it.

03:35:10.237 --> 03:35:12.574
ASHLEY: We also didn't know if she was going to be...

03:35:12.574 --> 03:35:14.926
LAURA: I thought she was a bad person.
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, I know exactly--

03:35:14.926 --> 03:35:17.178
LIAM: I think you were just trying
to stick up for a friend.

03:35:17.178 --> 03:35:18.619
ASHLEY: Yeah.
LAURA: Yeah.

03:35:18.619 --> 03:35:22.409
SAM: No, I think that the slightly mean hair comment

03:35:22.409 --> 03:35:24.829
was the worst thing that happened tonight

03:35:24.829 --> 03:35:26.969
and the worst thing that was talked about.

03:35:26.969 --> 03:35:30.482
LIAM: Yeah, if I'm going to take anything away tonight.

03:35:31.599 --> 03:35:33.474
MARISHA: I...

03:35:33.474 --> 03:35:37.307
am so fucking tired of manipulative assholes.

03:35:37.307 --> 03:35:38.889
LAURA: He's so manipulative.

03:35:38.889 --> 03:35:40.722
MARISHA: Like what's the deal-- what's the--

03:35:40.722 --> 03:35:43.738
why is that a theme with all of us?

03:35:43.738 --> 03:35:46.519
LAURA: I don't know what you're talking about.
LIAM: Well, we spend a lot time around government.

03:35:46.519 --> 03:35:48.502
(laughter)

03:35:55.001 --> 03:35:57.449
TALIESIN: That's the best thing you've ever said.

03:35:58.300 --> 03:36:00.619
LIAM: I missed it, what did she say?

03:36:00.619 --> 03:36:02.669
MARISHA: "I don't know what you're talking about."

03:36:04.239 --> 03:36:06.129
ASHLEY: It is a bit of a theme.

03:36:06.129 --> 03:36:08.617
MARISHA: I don't know why so many people have gone

03:36:08.617 --> 03:36:11.709
through such great lengths to try

03:36:11.709 --> 03:36:14.339
and convince us all that <i>they're</i> responsible

03:36:14.339 --> 03:36:15.702
for our success.

03:36:17.949 --> 03:36:18.782
TALIESIN: It's weird.

03:36:21.319 --> 03:36:22.402
MARISHA: The manipulation.

03:36:22.402 --> 03:36:26.143
If I hear one more person try and claim

03:36:26.143 --> 03:36:28.859
that pain is the only way...

03:36:30.142 --> 03:36:32.042
to make a resilient person.

03:36:34.079 --> 03:36:35.682
What a shitty excuse.

03:36:37.369 --> 03:36:38.872
LAURA: He's such a bad man.

03:36:40.119 --> 03:36:44.099
SAM: But you didn't want to just,
you know, quick draw on him,

03:36:44.099 --> 03:36:46.349
take him down right there in his dining room?

03:36:47.189 --> 03:36:51.429
LIAM: I give myself a 30% chance of success.

03:36:51.429 --> 03:36:54.395
SAM: You got us with you.
Element of surprise.

03:36:54.395 --> 03:36:58.159
LIAM: I give us 40% chance of success.

03:36:58.159 --> 03:37:01.589
TALIESIN: Really, I would've thought
that would've dropped it to like 28.

03:37:01.589 --> 03:37:03.481
LIAM: In there?
MARISHA: We could have done it.

03:37:03.481 --> 03:37:05.207
LIAM: In there, dicey.

03:37:06.272 --> 03:37:07.699
MARISHA: It's not killing him.

03:37:07.699 --> 03:37:08.657
TRAVIS: As soon as we walked in,

03:37:08.657 --> 03:37:13.559
I was not able to see anything with my vision anymore.

03:37:13.559 --> 03:37:15.309
It was immediately dispelled.

03:37:15.309 --> 03:37:17.747
LAURA: He can probably block some of our magic.

03:37:17.747 --> 03:37:19.380
TRAVIS: Fair bet.

03:37:19.380 --> 03:37:21.369
MARISHA: There's no way we would have gotten out.

03:37:21.369 --> 03:37:24.509
LAURA: Plus, he had Astrid and Eadwulf on his side.

03:37:24.509 --> 03:37:27.129
They're both probably pretty powerful.

03:37:27.129 --> 03:37:29.769
Not as powerful as you Caleb, let's be honest,

03:37:29.769 --> 03:37:31.209
but pretty powerful.

03:37:31.209 --> 03:37:33.489
I don't care that they had more years.

03:37:33.489 --> 03:37:35.331
It doesn't matter. You're very powerful.

03:37:35.331 --> 03:37:36.719
MARISHA: Did we find a tavern?

03:37:36.719 --> 03:37:37.552
TALIESIN: He said it himself.

03:37:37.552 --> 03:37:41.127
He's surrounded by people who despise him and lie to him.

03:37:41.127 --> 03:37:42.779
He's-- the minute that he slips up,

03:37:42.779 --> 03:37:44.388
someone's going to take him out, anyway.

03:37:44.388 --> 03:37:46.889
We don't have to do anything.

03:37:46.889 --> 03:37:48.714
He's set up his own destruction.

03:37:50.019 --> 03:37:51.239
The minute he'd stop losing,

03:37:51.239 --> 03:37:55.849
I'm sure both of them would turn
on him in a heartbeat, and he knows it.

03:37:55.849 --> 03:37:57.659
It's just so dumb.

03:37:57.659 --> 03:38:00.349
MARISHA: But, but he's not dumb.

03:38:00.349 --> 03:38:03.539
TALIESIN: Eh? I think he's pretty dumb.
MARISHA: So why?

03:38:03.539 --> 03:38:07.469
MARISHA: Emotionally, maybe, narrow-minded, yes,

03:38:07.469 --> 03:38:10.739
but he's calculated.

03:38:10.739 --> 03:38:12.849
LAURA: He knows exactly what he's saying.

03:38:12.849 --> 03:38:15.749
LIAM: Yeah, he's always been one to control narrative.

03:38:16.969 --> 03:38:19.609
And that is a big part of holding onto power,

03:38:19.609 --> 03:38:21.599
controlling narrative.

03:38:21.599 --> 03:38:23.409
LAURA: I believed him.

03:38:23.409 --> 03:38:27.639
I believe him, that your parents said do whatever it takes.

03:38:27.639 --> 03:38:29.999
I didn't feel like he was lying there, but--

03:38:29.999 --> 03:38:30.832
MARISHA: Of course.

03:38:30.832 --> 03:38:33.309
LAURA: There's no way they knew what that meant.

03:38:33.309 --> 03:38:37.019
TALIESIN: I have a funny feeling that if we
brought them back for a five minute chat,

03:38:37.019 --> 03:38:41.119
their first response would be, "I didn't agree to <i>this</i>."

03:38:41.119 --> 03:38:43.535
LAURA: Caleb, on that note,

03:38:44.502 --> 03:38:46.227
I was thinking about it at dinner.

03:38:46.227 --> 03:38:49.569
I mean, between Caduceus and I...

03:38:50.577 --> 03:38:52.309
we could bring them back.

03:38:52.309 --> 03:38:54.459
SAM: Don't you need a body?
TALIESIN: Body.

03:38:56.969 --> 03:38:57.802
LAURA: Oh.

03:39:02.369 --> 03:39:03.202
Yeah.

03:39:04.199 --> 03:39:07.679
SAM: Was there a grave for them?
LAURA: I think you just need bones?

03:39:07.679 --> 03:39:09.887
SAM: Yeah. Is there-- is there a marking?

03:39:09.887 --> 03:39:10.874
Do you know?

03:39:13.182 --> 03:39:15.144
LIAM: I have not looked into it.

03:39:16.656 --> 03:39:19.156
LAURA: I mean, if it's something you want to look into.

03:39:21.879 --> 03:39:23.509
LIAM: Let me think about that.

03:39:23.509 --> 03:39:25.562
There is a very good chance that the...

03:39:28.252 --> 03:39:30.510
Scourgers collected their remains, but maybe.

03:39:30.510 --> 03:39:33.993
Scourgers collected their remains, but maybe.

03:39:36.019 --> 03:39:38.033
LAURA: I'm sorry to bring it up.

03:39:38.033 --> 03:39:40.116
LIAM: No, it-- no, you--

03:39:40.116 --> 03:39:43.619
no, you are all trying to help me.

03:39:43.619 --> 03:39:48.459
No. Let's find that dive bar

03:39:48.459 --> 03:39:51.079
and then there's an inn,

03:39:51.079 --> 03:39:53.432
a place I know where we can stay tonight.

03:39:53.432 --> 03:39:54.548
MARISHA: Okay.

03:39:55.869 --> 03:39:57.239
MATT: Easy enough to find a dive bar.

03:39:57.239 --> 03:39:58.599
There are plenty of places in Rexxentrum

03:39:58.599 --> 03:40:00.515
especially up in the...

03:40:01.957 --> 03:40:05.569
northern more mud-laden region.

03:40:05.569 --> 03:40:08.169
You stumble into one of the nearby dive bars,

03:40:08.169 --> 03:40:10.289
not making too much of a fuss

03:40:10.289 --> 03:40:13.395
and find a place to comfortably feel like you can talk.

03:40:19.049 --> 03:40:21.489
SAM: Did that go well for you?

03:40:21.489 --> 03:40:22.905
LIAM: (laughs ruefully)

03:40:22.905 --> 03:40:23.752
No.

03:40:24.702 --> 03:40:26.862
No, it gave me 50 more questions.

03:40:29.099 --> 03:40:34.099
SAM: It seems like Astrid was,
you know, not a total...

03:40:34.240 --> 03:40:35.506
sociopath.

03:40:38.109 --> 03:40:39.079
Maybe?

03:40:39.079 --> 03:40:41.740
TALIESIN: I quite liked both of them, actually.

03:40:41.740 --> 03:40:42.929
LIAM: Yeah?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:40:42.929 --> 03:40:44.289
LIAM: They're very likable.

03:40:44.289 --> 03:40:45.762
TALIESIN: Well.
LIAM: They always were.

03:40:47.822 --> 03:40:49.679
TALIESIN: I've got a pretty good read on people.

03:40:49.679 --> 03:40:50.979
I think they're all right.

03:40:52.669 --> 03:40:55.002
And you did a good thing for them today.

03:40:56.099 --> 03:40:58.194
Showed them what life could be like,

03:40:58.194 --> 03:41:00.329
even just for a second.

03:41:00.329 --> 03:41:02.029
Maybe it'll stick in them.

03:41:02.979 --> 03:41:05.079
LIAM: I find myself wondering

03:41:06.062 --> 03:41:08.378
his "plan" for me to...

03:41:10.312 --> 03:41:13.295
take wing and achieve the things he wanted

03:41:13.295 --> 03:41:15.570
without being right under his thumb.

03:41:22.369 --> 03:41:25.272
If I go off and do anything with you all,

03:41:26.379 --> 03:41:27.929
is it part of his plan?

03:41:32.289 --> 03:41:35.259
TALIESIN: I got the sense he's kind of winging it.

03:41:35.259 --> 03:41:36.879
TRAVIS: Oh, I don't know.

03:41:36.879 --> 03:41:40.288
They hand delivered a letter to you
when you were in Rexxentrum.

03:41:40.288 --> 03:41:42.241
I think he was--
MARISHA: He knew we were meeting with Vess.

03:41:42.241 --> 03:41:44.319
TRAVIS: -- pretty much on top of it.

03:41:44.319 --> 03:41:46.479
TALIESIN: He's not-- he's not directing us, though.

03:41:46.479 --> 03:41:48.659
This is just him taking credit for what you're doing

03:41:48.659 --> 03:41:51.209
so that you can feel like you're being manipulated.

03:41:53.079 --> 03:41:55.689
This is--
MARISHA: It's an interesting--

03:41:55.689 --> 03:41:57.259
TALIESIN: This is just a person who can't admit

03:41:57.259 --> 03:41:58.736
that they're not in control.

03:41:58.736 --> 03:42:00.969
MARISHA: It's like a tarot card reader.

03:42:00.969 --> 03:42:05.677
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's actually a very fair estimation.
LAURA: Hey!

03:42:05.677 --> 03:42:07.789
That's not a good comparison at all.

03:42:07.789 --> 03:42:10.559
MARISHA: It's a great comparison, I'm brilliant.

03:42:10.559 --> 03:42:14.099
(laughter)

03:42:14.099 --> 03:42:15.599
SAM: Hey, speaking of tarot cards

03:42:15.599 --> 03:42:18.049
and stuff and controlling the narrative--

03:42:18.049 --> 03:42:19.469
LAURA: Do you want me to read your fortune?

03:42:19.469 --> 03:42:20.302
SAM: I do.

03:42:21.389 --> 03:42:23.529
While you're doing that,

03:42:23.529 --> 03:42:27.109
something that I assume you told me earlier about,

03:42:27.109 --> 03:42:31.219
about the research that you did today, or rather didn't do.

03:42:31.219 --> 03:42:32.369
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:42:32.369 --> 03:42:34.729
SAM: What if-- crazy theory--

03:42:34.729 --> 03:42:35.609
MARISHA: I'm here for it.

03:42:35.609 --> 03:42:39.939
SAM: What if there's no record of the Eyes of Nine

03:42:39.939 --> 03:42:43.049
in the Cobalt library

03:42:43.049 --> 03:42:45.399
not because they're hiding it from you,

03:42:45.399 --> 03:42:49.547
but because it was scrubbed because

03:42:49.547 --> 03:42:54.547
this Trent man or his ilk are somehow...

03:42:55.119 --> 03:42:56.689
you know, controlling the narrative,

03:42:56.689 --> 03:42:58.219
they don't want anyone to know about it.

03:42:58.219 --> 03:43:00.769
Or maybe even the Cobalt Soul itself.

03:43:00.769 --> 03:43:02.559
MARISHA: But Trent didn't seem to know what it was.

03:43:02.559 --> 03:43:04.534
I deliberately wanted to see in--

03:43:04.534 --> 03:43:07.279
SAM: He didn't <i>seem</i> to know, but he's a crafty fucker.

03:43:07.279 --> 03:43:09.987
MARISHA: He is, but not--
TALIESIN: I didn't get that vibe.

03:43:09.987 --> 03:43:11.899
MARISHA: He immediately asked if it was something

03:43:11.899 --> 03:43:13.609
that Vess put us up to.

03:43:13.609 --> 03:43:18.259
So, that to me clued me in on how laser focused he is

03:43:18.259 --> 03:43:20.342
on that aspect.

03:43:22.029 --> 03:43:24.862
Scrubbed, absolutely. From Trent?

03:43:26.595 --> 03:43:28.429
I don't know. The Cobalt Soul,

03:43:28.429 --> 03:43:30.309
they did also ask me if they've--

03:43:30.309 --> 03:43:32.889
if they went under any other names,

03:43:32.889 --> 03:43:36.969
if I know of any other associative language attached

03:43:36.969 --> 03:43:38.229
to the Eyes of Nine.

03:43:38.229 --> 03:43:40.689
SAM: Well, we know Nonagon, right?

03:43:40.689 --> 03:43:43.116
MARISHA: So I was-- I was thinking about that.

03:43:43.116 --> 03:43:44.989
And then here's the other crazy thing,

03:43:44.989 --> 03:43:47.269
nothing to do with your shit, really sorry,

03:43:47.269 --> 03:43:48.329
kind of going on a tangent.

03:43:48.329 --> 03:43:50.419
SAM: I don't know, maybe it's all connected.

03:43:50.419 --> 03:43:54.577
MARISHA: So, Trent asked us about

03:43:54.577 --> 03:43:57.433
Shattengrod and tomb raiding.

03:43:57.433 --> 03:43:59.519
Nonagon-- where is it?

03:43:59.519 --> 03:44:00.352
Hang on--

03:44:00.352 --> 03:44:01.812
TALIESIN: Rhymes with?
MARISHA: Cree--

03:44:01.812 --> 03:44:03.387
(laughter)

03:44:03.387 --> 03:44:06.312
SAM: Has 14 letters in it, which is--

03:44:06.312 --> 03:44:07.509
MARISHA: When you rearrange them

03:44:07.509 --> 03:44:10.143
and add their numeral position together--!

03:44:10.143 --> 03:44:12.422
LIAM: Remember to drink your Ovaltine.

03:44:12.422 --> 03:44:14.355
(laughter)

03:44:15.239 --> 03:44:16.072
MARISHA: But no.

03:44:17.669 --> 03:44:20.749
That Cree that we talked to at The Gentleman's lair--

03:44:20.749 --> 03:44:23.473
ASHLEY: Yes!
MARISHA: -- asked about Nonagon

03:44:23.473 --> 03:44:27.399
and said that she was a part of his team called

03:44:27.399 --> 03:44:31.209
the Tomb Takers and that they were running

03:44:31.209 --> 03:44:35.479
from a spell caster two years ago.

03:44:35.479 --> 03:44:38.829
MARISHA: Running from a spell caster named <i>Trent Ikithon</i>!

03:44:38.829 --> 03:44:41.053
MARISHA: Or Vess DeRogna,

03:44:41.053 --> 03:44:45.638
the lady of antiquities who sends people off to rob tombs.

03:44:45.638 --> 03:44:47.751
LAURA: (gasps)

03:44:47.751 --> 03:44:50.759
And I was already planning on going to see my dad.

03:44:50.759 --> 03:44:52.879
This is perfect.
ASHLEY: Cree was that person's name?

03:44:52.879 --> 03:44:54.699
MARISHA: Cree the tabaxi.

03:44:54.699 --> 03:44:57.496
ASHLEY: And Cree recognized--

03:44:57.496 --> 03:44:58.746
MARISHA: Nonagon.

03:44:58.746 --> 03:45:00.554
ASHLEY: Nonagon, which was...

03:45:01.620 --> 03:45:03.509
MARISHA: Molly.
ASHLEY: Molly.

03:45:03.509 --> 03:45:04.569
MARISHA: And...

03:45:07.676 --> 03:45:08.816
ASHLEY: I mean, they would probably know--

03:45:08.816 --> 03:45:11.959
MARISHA: Their group-- stole a book and trouble

03:45:11.959 --> 03:45:16.259
with the law. Ritual resistant teleport spell. Stole a book.

03:45:16.259 --> 03:45:17.499
Did they steal a book or something?

03:45:17.499 --> 03:45:20.467
I'm trying to decipher my notes, like, a year later.

03:45:21.629 --> 03:45:23.099
MATT: More or less, best that you can recall.

03:45:23.099 --> 03:45:25.469
MARISHA: They maybe stole a book, I don't know,

03:45:25.469 --> 03:45:29.359
but they were running from someone
and they were called the Tomb Takers.

03:45:29.359 --> 03:45:31.139
LAURA: Whoa.
ASHLEY: I remember that.

03:45:31.139 --> 03:45:32.239
LAURA: Maybe we should just--

03:45:32.239 --> 03:45:35.044
SAM: Oh, the "Tomb Takers" or
the "Task Takers," I wrote down.

03:45:35.949 --> 03:45:38.222
But no, I also wrote down Tomb Taker.
MARISHA: The task--

03:45:38.222 --> 03:45:41.699
LAURA: What-- what if I--
MARISHA: Oh now, are they the Tomb Taskers?

03:45:41.699 --> 03:45:44.259
SAM: I wrote down "Tomb Takers or Task Takers."

03:45:44.259 --> 03:45:46.219
LAURA: What if we just like--

03:45:46.219 --> 03:45:48.127
while we're hanging out with Vess and we're like,

03:45:48.127 --> 03:45:50.902
"Oh my god, we should come up
with a group name or something."

03:45:50.902 --> 03:45:53.229
MARISHA: "I got an idea, the Tomb Takers!"

03:45:53.229 --> 03:45:54.629
LAURA: And see what says.
MARISHA: And see if she's like--

03:45:54.629 --> 03:45:56.412
(gasp) Dun dun dun!

03:45:56.412 --> 03:45:57.437
It's a pretty good idea.

03:45:57.437 --> 03:45:59.779
TALIESIN: We could just talk to them.

03:45:59.779 --> 03:46:01.862
MARISHA: Yeah.
LAURA: Or that.

03:46:01.862 --> 03:46:04.211
SAM: Your plans are always so boring.

03:46:04.211 --> 03:46:06.539
(laughter)

03:46:06.539 --> 03:46:07.902
TALIESIN: I'll let you go first.

03:46:08.812 --> 03:46:10.029
I'd like to have a backup.

03:46:10.029 --> 03:46:12.271
I like to have a plan G.
SAM: Sure.

03:46:12.271 --> 03:46:14.089
(laughter)

03:46:14.089 --> 03:46:16.363
MARISHA: Then I feel like there was another thing...

03:46:16.363 --> 03:46:17.679
Oh! Oh!

03:46:19.719 --> 03:46:20.552
Okay, hang on.

03:46:20.552 --> 03:46:22.369
TALIESIN: You've mentioned that tabaxi before.

03:46:22.369 --> 03:46:25.226
LIAM: We are in a bar while she does this.
It's so perfect.

03:46:25.226 --> 03:46:27.799
MARISHA: I'm just flinging notebooks around,

03:46:27.799 --> 03:46:29.549
as Beau goes through all of her notebooks.

03:46:30.993 --> 03:46:35.993
SAM: Can we get a round of drinks and
some yarn, and some thumbtacks, please?

03:46:36.132 --> 03:46:38.383
MATT: "Yeah, yeah, hold on, it's coming."

03:46:38.383 --> 03:46:42.019
MARISHA: This is super conspiracy theory-tastic, but okay.

03:46:42.019 --> 03:46:46.019
So we're going to excavate the city of Aeor.

03:46:46.019 --> 03:46:50.002
And it was this mage... ocrity.

03:46:50.002 --> 03:46:50.989
LIAM: A mageocracy.

03:46:50.989 --> 03:46:54.663
MARISHA: And they think that no survivors lived.

03:46:54.663 --> 03:46:56.163
Right?
LIAM: Right.

03:46:57.449 --> 03:47:01.569
MARISHA: But what if there was <i>one</i>?

03:47:01.569 --> 03:47:02.402
SAM: Who?

03:47:02.402 --> 03:47:03.759
MARISHA: Halas.

03:47:03.759 --> 03:47:06.869
SAM: Who's Halas? Oh! The Happy Fun Ball?

03:47:06.869 --> 03:47:11.159
MARISHA: Yes, because when we were in his little ball

03:47:11.159 --> 03:47:12.509
for the Astral Sea thing,

03:47:12.509 --> 03:47:14.925
we already mentioned this in the Happy Fun Ball.

03:47:14.925 --> 03:47:17.967
And then we saw the Astral Sea--
LIAM: I wanted to follow up at this,

03:47:17.967 --> 03:47:20.779
this coming week in the libraries and see if--

03:47:20.779 --> 03:47:21.884
MARISHA: Right.

03:47:21.884 --> 03:47:25.689
Because he had that map and it was the map from--

03:47:25.689 --> 03:47:28.788
that you touched the red gem of,

03:47:28.788 --> 03:47:31.609
and it was pre-Calamity.

03:47:31.609 --> 03:47:33.259
LAURA: Oh yeah, definitely.
LIAM: Yeah.

03:47:33.259 --> 03:47:36.084
MARISHA: The stained glass window was a pre-Calamity map.

03:47:37.349 --> 03:47:40.229
So maybe this guy was from pre-Calamity

03:47:40.229 --> 03:47:43.579
and he got super obsessed with, like, living for forever.

03:47:43.579 --> 03:47:44.609
But maybe what if he's--

03:47:44.609 --> 03:47:49.609
what if he's a survivor from Aeora-- Aeor? Aorta?

03:47:49.609 --> 03:47:52.105
LIAM: No, that is plausible.

03:47:52.105 --> 03:47:54.289
MARISHA: But I don't even know how any of this connects!

03:47:54.289 --> 03:47:59.274
SAM: Well, the Astral Sea also
connects Vokodo somehow, right?

03:47:59.274 --> 03:48:01.275
ASHLEY: And that weird floating city?
TRAVIS: That's where he came from.

03:48:01.275 --> 03:48:04.569
MARISHA: What if Aeor is part of that weird floating city

03:48:04.569 --> 03:48:06.711
that we saw? What if it just like-- (whooshes)

03:48:06.711 --> 03:48:11.192
MARISHA: Oh, like that's Aeor and it just bamfed into--?!

03:48:11.192 --> 03:48:14.207
ASHLEY: Like it was so magical it just--

03:48:14.207 --> 03:48:16.507
MARISHA: It just like-- it didn't
actually crash? It's there?

03:48:16.507 --> 03:48:18.107
LAURA: We figured out the whole world!

03:48:18.107 --> 03:48:22.269
LIAM: Or a contemporary-- another city of the time.

03:48:23.179 --> 03:48:26.087
LAURA: While all this is happening, I'm going to be

03:48:26.087 --> 03:48:28.412
telling Fjord's fortune with tarot cards.

03:48:28.412 --> 03:48:30.426
TRAVIS: I didn't ask you-- why
do you keep putting them there?

03:48:30.426 --> 03:48:32.269
LAURA: I'm going to pull out the cards.

03:48:32.269 --> 03:48:34.019
Just choose a number between one

03:48:34.019 --> 03:48:36.007
and 20. Roll your dice.

03:48:38.234 --> 03:48:39.292
TRAVIS: Eight.

03:48:39.292 --> 03:48:42.926
LAURA: Okay, that's going to be the card you pulled out.

03:48:42.926 --> 03:48:44.892
TRAVIS: Okay.
MATT: Okay.

03:48:44.892 --> 03:48:46.942
LAURA: Okay. Going to see what that is.

03:48:46.942 --> 03:48:49.339
TALIESIN: I was going to say, I don't remember the
last time I sent you that document.

03:48:49.339 --> 03:48:50.334
LAURA: Okay.

03:48:50.334 --> 03:48:53.741
I don't know-- I'm just going to read this card for you.

03:48:53.741 --> 03:48:55.239
TRAVIS: And this tells me my future?

03:48:55.239 --> 03:48:58.223
LAURA: Obviously I'm going to interpret it.
TRAVIS: It's my future, or what?

03:48:58.223 --> 03:49:01.531
LAURA: This is going
to be where you are right now,

03:49:01.531 --> 03:49:03.197
in your present.

03:49:03.197 --> 03:49:04.569
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:49:04.569 --> 03:49:08.672
LAURA: The eye and the hand is the card.

03:49:09.939 --> 03:49:11.513
So...
SAM: You have both of those things.

03:49:11.513 --> 03:49:12.346
It's amazing.

03:49:12.346 --> 03:49:16.902
LAURA: Yeah, one way, which-- pick--

03:49:17.884 --> 03:49:19.742
roll a d6.

03:49:19.742 --> 03:49:21.229
TALIESIN: (laughs)

03:49:21.229 --> 03:49:23.384
TRAVIS: I feel like you're making this up.

03:49:24.229 --> 03:49:25.062
Two.

03:49:25.062 --> 03:49:28.949
LAURA: Okay, so the eye is facing towards you.

03:49:28.949 --> 03:49:33.162
An eye is held by two hands forming a triangle.

03:49:34.059 --> 03:49:38.362
The hands are holding the eye above a restless sea.

03:49:39.827 --> 03:49:43.202
(laughter)

03:49:49.679 --> 03:49:51.217
SAM: An eye.

03:49:51.217 --> 03:49:52.658
LAURA: Yeah!

03:49:52.658 --> 03:49:53.851
I know!

03:49:53.851 --> 03:49:55.176
Above a restless sea!

03:49:55.176 --> 03:49:57.976
SAM: Amazing!
LAURA: Oh my god, Fjord!

03:49:57.976 --> 03:50:00.101
The triangle's like Rumblecusp.

03:50:00.101 --> 03:50:02.171
Oh my gosh, this-- okay.

03:50:02.171 --> 03:50:03.929
Now roll another d20.

03:50:03.929 --> 03:50:06.912
TRAVIS: There's more?
LAURA: Yeah, then this is going to be your future.

03:50:06.912 --> 03:50:08.839
SAM: Wait, wait, what was the interpretation of that?

03:50:08.839 --> 03:50:11.889
LAURA: Oh, that's-- you know, obviously you are--

03:50:11.889 --> 03:50:16.089
you are torn between where you came from,

03:50:16.089 --> 03:50:19.389
which is the eye and the sea, the turmoil

03:50:19.389 --> 03:50:21.829
of the Wild Mother right now.

03:50:21.829 --> 03:50:24.659
You're figuring out who you are in this very moment.

03:50:24.659 --> 03:50:28.059
Do you go and take care of Uk'otoa--

03:50:28.059 --> 03:50:30.689
ALL: (whispered) Uk'otoa.

03:50:30.689 --> 03:50:33.843
LAURA: -- or do you follow the path
that's being laid in front of you by her?

03:50:33.843 --> 03:50:35.101
TRAVIS: 11.

03:50:36.815 --> 03:50:40.169
Oh my god, this is such a good card.

03:50:41.199 --> 03:50:42.209
TALIESIN: I love this so much.

03:50:42.209 --> 03:50:46.879
LAURA: This card is called Home or Traveler.

03:50:46.879 --> 03:50:49.346
SAM: Traveler?
LAURA: Yeah.

03:50:49.346 --> 03:50:51.049
MARISHA: Oh, wait, is this a secondary card?

03:50:51.049 --> 03:50:52.970
LAURA: Yeah, this is the future card.

03:50:52.970 --> 03:50:55.159
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

03:50:55.159 --> 03:50:57.829
LAURA: A covered carnival wagon on a road

03:50:57.829 --> 03:51:01.032
with a cottage cozy in the distance.

03:51:02.182 --> 03:51:03.515
You are--
SAM: That's us!

03:51:03.515 --> 03:51:05.836
LAURA: Yeah! You're a--
TRAVIS: How is that you?!

03:51:05.836 --> 03:51:09.729
SAM: When we met you, we were at a carnival!

03:51:09.729 --> 03:51:11.693
LAURA: So it's a carnival card,

03:51:11.693 --> 03:51:14.466
but it's a cozy cottage in the distance, Fjord.

03:51:14.466 --> 03:51:16.099
Don't you see?
SAM: We are your home.

03:51:16.989 --> 03:51:18.697
LAURA: Don't you see?
TRAVIS: I don't--

03:51:18.697 --> 03:51:20.269
LAURA: You're you're on the road right now.

03:51:20.269 --> 03:51:22.599
You feel like everything is a circus.

03:51:22.599 --> 03:51:27.299
You don't know what's going on, but in the distance, Fjord,

03:51:27.299 --> 03:51:29.982
there is a cozy home waiting for you.

03:51:31.939 --> 03:51:34.029
That's your future.

03:51:34.029 --> 03:51:35.571
TRAVIS: A cozy home?

03:51:35.571 --> 03:51:39.794
LAURA: Yeah! Your home, your place, you will find it.

03:51:42.539 --> 03:51:44.369
TRAVIS: That's wonderful, Jester.

03:51:44.369 --> 03:51:46.317
LAURA: I know, isn't it?

03:51:49.369 --> 03:51:50.577
Anybody else?

03:51:51.999 --> 03:51:55.379
MATT: Caleb, as a note, too, going off the conversation

03:51:55.379 --> 03:51:56.689
with Beauregard--

03:51:56.689 --> 03:51:58.322
That was amazing.

03:51:59.429 --> 03:52:02.069
You did know, cause you recalled this as you were recalling

03:52:02.069 --> 03:52:05.182
information about Halas in the Folding Halls.

03:52:06.369 --> 03:52:08.849
He is historically known to have hailed from

03:52:10.181 --> 03:52:12.276
LIAM: Zeidel?
MATT: From, well--

03:52:12.276 --> 03:52:14.446
LIAM: He had books about Zeidel.

03:52:14.446 --> 03:52:17.229
MATT: Right, well Zeidel was the society,
the actual...

03:52:19.855 --> 03:52:21.171
council of Zeidel,

03:52:21.171 --> 03:52:22.289
which he was part of.

03:52:22.289 --> 03:52:25.999
But the actual city that he was from was Zemniaz,

03:52:25.999 --> 03:52:27.599
which was another one of the floating cities,

03:52:27.599 --> 03:52:29.679
a competitive nation to

03:52:29.679 --> 03:52:32.279
where Aeor would have come from that when it fell

03:52:32.279 --> 03:52:33.299
in the Calamity,

03:52:33.299 --> 03:52:35.129
the survivors of that are

03:52:35.129 --> 03:52:38.369
who began the early Dwendalian Empire.

03:52:38.369 --> 03:52:40.752
LIAM: When Zemniaz fell?
MATT: Yeah, Zemniaz fell,

03:52:40.752 --> 03:52:42.894
which is why it's called the Zemni
Fields and Zemnian language.

03:52:42.894 --> 03:52:47.894
It's all based on the survivors and scroungers of--

03:52:48.429 --> 03:52:50.649
LIAM: Another separate floating city.

03:52:50.649 --> 03:52:51.486
MATT: Correct.

03:52:51.486 --> 03:52:54.069
MARISHA: Okay, so scratch the whole "he was from Aeor"--

03:52:54.069 --> 03:52:57.242
but same time in neighboring--
LIAM: Same time.

03:52:57.242 --> 03:53:00.239
MATT: Zemniaz was a much smaller and comparatively to Aeor,

03:53:00.239 --> 03:53:02.909
Aeor was the superpower.

03:53:02.909 --> 03:53:04.829
Zemniaz was still a powerful agent, you know,

03:53:04.829 --> 03:53:08.449
one of a handful of floating mage nations.

03:53:08.449 --> 03:53:09.282
LIAM: Yeah.

03:53:09.282 --> 03:53:11.159
And it would be very interesting

03:53:11.159 --> 03:53:15.469
to dive back into the halls of Halas

03:53:15.469 --> 03:53:16.999
and find him and ask him questions,

03:53:16.999 --> 03:53:20.449
but that is quite a-- that's a tall order.
MARISHA: That's a task.

03:53:20.449 --> 03:53:23.999
But there's also all those businesses with Tharizdun

03:53:23.999 --> 03:53:25.999
and the Abyssal invasion that he apparently threatened.

03:53:25.999 --> 03:53:30.879
and the Abyssal invasion that he apparently threatened.

03:53:30.879 --> 03:53:34.309
SAM: Yeah, it seems like there's all sorts of other realms

03:53:34.309 --> 03:53:39.309
and planes sort of converging here for some reason.

03:53:40.023 --> 03:53:42.657
ASHLEY: I had written down the same thing.

03:53:44.419 --> 03:53:48.689
I had "an order of Tomb Takers question mark?

03:53:48.689 --> 03:53:51.549
"Went north to Shattenguard?

03:53:51.549 --> 03:53:53.219
"Mollymauk's old order."

03:53:53.219 --> 03:53:55.495
MARISHA: To Shattengrod, really? Okay!

03:53:55.495 --> 03:53:56.959
ASHLEY: Mollymauk's old order.

03:53:56.959 --> 03:53:59.439
He pulled them off from the main order.

03:53:59.439 --> 03:54:01.531
No idea what that means.

03:54:01.531 --> 03:54:03.071
LIAM: He made a sect.

03:54:03.071 --> 03:54:05.747
MATT: Yeah.
ASHLEY: So yeah.

03:54:05.747 --> 03:54:07.039
TALIESIN: It's a sect.
ASHLEY: I mean, this was--

03:54:07.039 --> 03:54:08.488
TALIESIN: I'm a sect. That's good.

03:54:08.488 --> 03:54:11.859
MARISHA: What if it was Vess DeRogna
was that was coming after him?

03:54:11.859 --> 03:54:14.222
TALIESIN: I'm lost.

03:54:14.222 --> 03:54:16.749
LIAM: I mean, right after what I wrote--
SAM: Well, a magical woman revived him.

03:54:16.749 --> 03:54:19.179
MARISHA: Huh?
SAM: A magical woman revived him.

03:54:19.179 --> 03:54:20.012
Right?

03:54:21.339 --> 03:54:23.069
MARISHA: He-- yeah,

03:54:23.069 --> 03:54:24.419
he just woke up.

03:54:24.419 --> 03:54:27.299
SAM: Well no, I wrote down "a magical woman revived him."

03:54:27.299 --> 03:54:29.881
MARISHA: It was a ritual spell.
He doesn't know, he doesn't remember.

03:54:29.881 --> 03:54:32.499
LIAM: I thought-- I remember that as well.

03:54:32.499 --> 03:54:34.589
A woman helped pull him out of it.

03:54:34.589 --> 03:54:35.422
SAM: Yeah.

03:54:35.422 --> 03:54:36.255
LIAM: To my recollection.

03:54:36.255 --> 03:54:37.996
TRAVIS: Chat is just screaming at us right now.

03:54:37.996 --> 03:54:40.271
LIAM: Oh, sure. They've got it all figured out.

03:54:40.271 --> 03:54:42.679
(laughter)

03:54:42.679 --> 03:54:45.849
LIAM: But guys, where I wrote "Tomb Takers" and "Nonagon",

03:54:45.849 --> 03:54:50.845
I've also written "mahogany desk"
and "young, bearded gnome".

03:54:50.845 --> 03:54:54.714
(laughter)

03:54:54.714 --> 03:54:56.446
TALIESIN: You've cracked it.

03:54:56.446 --> 03:54:58.321
LIAM: We've cracked the case!
MARISHA: What if...

03:54:59.221 --> 03:55:00.404
TALIESIN: Orange gummy bear gnome.

03:55:00.404 --> 03:55:03.249
MARISHA: What if Nonagon...

03:55:03.249 --> 03:55:06.165
was pillaged?

03:55:06.165 --> 03:55:10.549
What if he was, instead of the robber,

03:55:10.549 --> 03:55:13.722
what if he was the rob-ee?

03:55:15.072 --> 03:55:15.905
TRAVIS: Robbie!

03:55:15.905 --> 03:55:16.898
MARISHA: Robbie!

03:55:16.898 --> 03:55:19.917
(laughter)

03:55:19.917 --> 03:55:21.102
Love you, Robbie.

03:55:21.102 --> 03:55:23.893
TALIESIN: I am genuinely delighted by all this.
TRAVIS: He's not Molly, he's Robbie!

03:55:23.893 --> 03:55:28.785
(laughter)

03:55:28.785 --> 03:55:30.019
MARISHA: I don't know, man.

03:55:30.019 --> 03:55:32.094
I have so many notes and--

03:55:32.094 --> 03:55:33.035
TRAVIS: Beau, drink your beer.

03:55:33.035 --> 03:55:36.259
It's got to-- it's got to connect.

03:55:36.259 --> 03:55:37.989
TRAVIS: Who gave her a straw for a beer?

03:55:37.989 --> 03:55:39.649
MARISHA: It's all I got, man.

03:55:39.649 --> 03:55:42.469
It's this weird-ass mixology bar.

03:55:44.179 --> 03:55:46.822
TALIESIN: We, uh...
MATT: Not on this side of Rexxentrum.

03:55:46.822 --> 03:55:48.229
TALIESIN: We have someone we can talk to.

03:55:48.229 --> 03:55:49.245
SAM: Who?

03:55:50.829 --> 03:55:52.949
TALIESIN: The tabaxi, Cree..

03:55:52.949 --> 03:55:54.779
SAM: So we're going to go to Zadash next.

03:55:54.779 --> 03:55:59.545
TALIESIN: And then maybe your dad can set up an

03:55:59.545 --> 03:56:01.378
honest conversation?

03:56:01.378 --> 03:56:02.819
LAURA: With Cree?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:56:02.819 --> 03:56:04.289
No threats, no harm.

03:56:04.289 --> 03:56:05.669
TRAVIS: If Cree's there.

03:56:05.669 --> 03:56:07.699
LAURA: I can send my dad a message

03:56:07.699 --> 03:56:09.529
and ask if he can gather Cree there.

03:56:09.529 --> 03:56:11.512
I'm going to send my dad a message.

03:56:12.351 --> 03:56:14.199
Hey Dad, it's me.

03:56:14.199 --> 03:56:16.012
We have a favor to ask.

03:56:18.071 --> 03:56:20.720
Can you get Cree?

03:56:22.119 --> 03:56:26.318
We need to talk to him.

03:56:26.318 --> 03:56:27.259
SAM: Him?

03:56:27.259 --> 03:56:28.092
Her.
MATT: Her.

03:56:28.092 --> 03:56:29.876
LAURA: Her. Shit. Her.

03:56:29.876 --> 03:56:31.365
LIAM: Him, her.
TRAVIS: (siren noise)

03:56:34.039 --> 03:56:35.347
LAURA: Super important!

03:56:37.453 --> 03:56:38.559
I love you!

03:56:41.629 --> 03:56:43.829
MATT: "Jester, it's been a while.

03:56:44.939 --> 03:56:49.319
"I'd love to help, but Cree left months ago

03:56:49.319 --> 03:56:50.539
"and hasn't returned.

03:56:50.539 --> 03:56:52.249
"So I have no idea what she is."

03:56:52.249 --> 03:56:53.149
LIAM: Damn it.

03:56:53.149 --> 03:56:54.799
MATT: "Sorry."

03:56:56.299 --> 03:56:57.490
"Anyway, I--"

03:56:57.490 --> 03:57:00.315
(laughter)

03:57:00.315 --> 03:57:02.842
TALIESIN: Actually, might be able to find him.

03:57:02.842 --> 03:57:04.646
MARISHA: Yeah, can we, can we send Cree a message?

03:57:04.646 --> 03:57:06.579
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah!

03:57:06.579 --> 03:57:08.282
I mean, I met Cree, right?

03:57:08.282 --> 03:57:10.319
MARISHA: Yeah.
LAURA: Yeah.

03:57:10.319 --> 03:57:12.379
I'm going to send Cree a message.

03:57:12.379 --> 03:57:14.039
MATT: Okay.

03:57:14.039 --> 03:57:15.509
LAURA: Hi, Cree!
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:57:15.509 --> 03:57:17.929
LAURA: It's Jester. Remember me?

03:57:19.439 --> 03:57:20.272
Where are you?

03:57:20.272 --> 03:57:22.409
I need to talk to you.

03:57:22.409 --> 03:57:23.499
It's about--

03:57:23.499 --> 03:57:24.855
MARISHA: (whispered) Molly.

03:57:24.855 --> 03:57:25.908
Nonagon! Say Nonagon.

03:57:25.908 --> 03:57:26.741
LAURA: Nonagon.

03:57:26.741 --> 03:57:28.119
SAM: Or Lucien.
LAURA: Or Lucien.

03:57:28.119 --> 03:57:29.117
You know.

03:57:29.117 --> 03:57:31.329
(laughter)

03:57:31.329 --> 03:57:33.152
Lemme know, okay?

03:57:34.369 --> 03:57:35.610
That was four.

03:57:35.610 --> 03:57:37.481
(laughter)

03:57:37.481 --> 03:57:39.666
TRAVIS: "Let me know, okay?"

03:57:40.924 --> 03:57:43.643
SAM: Lemme. We're treating--
LAURA: Oh, lemme.

03:57:43.643 --> 03:57:45.419
TRAVIS: L-E-M-M-E, right?

03:57:45.419 --> 03:57:48.735
MATT: A few moments pass before you get a response.

03:57:49.849 --> 03:57:52.464
(distrustful) "Who is this?"

03:57:55.259 --> 03:57:57.199
LAURA: She doesn't remember me.

03:57:57.199 --> 03:57:59.850
MATT: "I don't think I can help you."

03:58:00.699 --> 03:58:01.890
That's it.

03:58:03.541 --> 03:58:05.780
LAURA: I'm going to send a message back.

03:58:07.069 --> 03:58:12.069
The blue girl. Jester. We met a while ago.

03:58:12.389 --> 03:58:14.309
I had a group of friends.

03:58:14.309 --> 03:58:16.869
We knew Lucien-- Lucien.

03:58:16.869 --> 03:58:17.702
SAM: At the club.

03:58:17.702 --> 03:58:20.299
LAURA: At the--
SAM: Gentleman's club.

03:58:20.299 --> 03:58:22.963
MARISHA: Uh... (babbles) The Evening Nip!

03:58:22.963 --> 03:58:24.446
LAURA: At the Evening Nip.

03:58:24.446 --> 03:58:26.282
LIAM: Down to the-- to the-- to the floor?

03:58:26.282 --> 03:58:27.929
SAM: Ooh, money is involved!

03:58:27.929 --> 03:58:29.347
LAURA: Money's involved.

03:58:29.347 --> 03:58:30.724
ASHLEY: Good job, good job.

03:58:32.665 --> 03:58:34.248
MATT: Few more moments pass.

03:58:35.522 --> 03:58:37.855
And a few more moments pass.

03:58:39.161 --> 03:58:40.243
After a while you get the sense that

03:58:40.243 --> 03:58:41.308
there's going to be no response.

03:58:41.308 --> 03:58:43.103
LIAM: (groans)

03:58:43.103 --> 03:58:46.404
LAURA: Bitch. She made me waste a spell slot.

03:58:47.299 --> 03:58:50.649
MARISHA: Well, if she works for The Gentleman,

03:58:50.649 --> 03:58:52.849
then we know The Gentleman has her blood

03:58:52.849 --> 03:58:55.331
and The Gentleman should be able to trace her.

03:58:55.331 --> 03:58:56.839
TALIESIN: We'll go tomorrow.

03:58:56.839 --> 03:58:57.672
LAURA: That's a good point.

03:58:57.672 --> 03:58:59.619
MATT: Point of interesting order.

03:58:59.619 --> 03:59:02.299
<i>She</i> was the one who kept

03:59:02.299 --> 03:59:04.274
and extracted the blood for The Gentleman.

03:59:04.274 --> 03:59:05.107
MARISHA: Fuck!

03:59:05.979 --> 03:59:09.789
MATT: That was specifically her skillset.

03:59:09.789 --> 03:59:10.622
LAURA: So she would probably--

03:59:10.622 --> 03:59:11.692
MATT: She was a blood cleric.

03:59:12.814 --> 03:59:15.833
TRAVIS: (singsong) Very similar to Molly.

03:59:15.833 --> 03:59:19.505
TALIESIN and TRAVIS: Hmm! Hmm!

03:59:20.719 --> 03:59:22.736
SAM: Well, that's a dead end.

03:59:22.736 --> 03:59:24.569
TALIESIN: Uh, well...

03:59:24.569 --> 03:59:26.443
MARISHA: What do we do? What do we do?

03:59:26.443 --> 03:59:28.249
TALIESIN: I got-- I got things.

03:59:28.249 --> 03:59:29.659
TRAVIS: We go to Antarctica

03:59:29.659 --> 03:59:31.779
and we fucking find an underground city

03:59:31.779 --> 03:59:33.527
and some other crazy magic shit.

03:59:33.527 --> 03:59:35.938
LAURA: Well, we're going to do that, but first--

03:59:35.938 --> 03:59:38.529
LIAM: We have whole week in Rexxentrum.

03:59:38.529 --> 03:59:39.419
TALIESIN: We also have Scry.

03:59:39.419 --> 03:59:40.979
LIAM: Or anywhere we want to be.

03:59:40.979 --> 03:59:43.369
LAURA: Well, I do want to see my dad.

03:59:43.369 --> 03:59:46.839
I guess I don't have to. I can just send him messages.

03:59:46.839 --> 03:59:48.819
TALIESIN: I feel like talking to your dad anyway,

03:59:48.819 --> 03:59:51.229
just to see if we can get any information.

03:59:51.229 --> 03:59:53.235
LIAM: Yeah, handful of words is different than--

03:59:53.235 --> 03:59:54.580
LAURA: Plus, we can see Pumat!

03:59:54.580 --> 03:59:57.309
Don't you guys have things you want enchanted?

03:59:57.309 --> 03:59:58.209
TALIESIN: Always.

03:59:58.209 --> 04:00:01.089
TRAVIS: Oh, so many things.

04:00:01.089 --> 04:00:02.079
LIAM: Yeah, that ring of yours.

04:00:02.079 --> 04:00:04.421
You've got to get some magic into that.

04:00:06.794 --> 04:00:07.627
TRAVIS: (whispered) Yes.

04:00:09.309 --> 04:00:10.142
TALIESIN: I'd like to talk--

04:00:10.142 --> 04:00:12.083
I'd like to talk to him about that, actually.

04:00:12.083 --> 04:00:14.949
LIAM: Well, what if we holed up here in town for the night

04:00:14.949 --> 04:00:19.369
and in the morning, spend the day in the Zadash?

04:00:21.053 --> 04:00:22.589
LAURA: Okay.

04:00:22.589 --> 04:00:23.672
MARISHA: Okay.

04:00:24.749 --> 04:00:29.069
LAURA: You don't think Icky-thong's going to come after you?

04:00:29.069 --> 04:00:30.799
LIAM: No, I am his chosen.

04:00:30.799 --> 04:00:34.562
I will lead the Empire into a thousand years of glory

04:00:35.589 --> 04:00:36.780
or something.

04:00:37.729 --> 04:00:38.964
No, not tonight.

04:00:41.149 --> 04:00:44.859
Besides, I have this place we can stay tonight

04:00:44.859 --> 04:00:48.229
that I think you will love.

04:00:49.779 --> 04:00:51.049
TRAVIS: Oh, a new spot?

04:00:52.259 --> 04:00:54.969
MARISHA: Not the shitty tavern where we were at?
LAURA: Let's go!

04:00:54.969 --> 04:00:56.759
LIAM: Not the shitty tavern.

04:00:56.759 --> 04:00:58.549
MARISHA: All right.

04:00:58.549 --> 04:00:59.409
LIAM: Trust me?

04:00:59.409 --> 04:01:00.249
SAM: Trust?

04:01:00.249 --> 04:01:01.082
MARISHA: Totally, man.

04:01:01.082 --> 04:01:02.029
LIAM: All right.

04:01:02.029 --> 04:01:03.539
I slap down two gold.

04:01:03.539 --> 04:01:04.699
I have no idea what the bill was,

04:01:04.699 --> 04:01:05.669
but I'm sure that covers it.

04:01:05.669 --> 04:01:08.239
MATT: It definitely covers it. (laughs)

04:01:08.239 --> 04:01:11.341
LIAM: Head towards the door and I will--

04:01:12.535 --> 04:01:13.689
I'm not going to say this to any of them,

04:01:13.689 --> 04:01:18.169
but I will either go to the same basic-ass inn

04:01:18.169 --> 04:01:20.919
that we went to earlier or whatever's closest.

04:01:20.919 --> 04:01:21.985
MATT: Okay.

04:01:23.049 --> 04:01:25.309
To where you are now, you're a little bit further away.

04:01:25.309 --> 04:01:26.659
LIAM: Yeah.

04:01:26.659 --> 04:01:30.249
MATT: So you would be finding a new location

04:01:30.249 --> 04:01:31.739
and it's not hard to find.

04:01:31.739 --> 04:01:33.899
They're all pretty-- you know,

04:01:33.899 --> 04:01:36.161
you're on the cusp of squalor in this part of the city.

04:01:36.161 --> 04:01:38.417
LIAM: That's good.
MATT: Okay.

04:01:38.417 --> 04:01:40.149
So I will find a place

04:01:40.149 --> 04:01:42.199
that doesn't look like an instant death trap,

04:01:42.199 --> 04:01:44.469
but I'm not being that picky.

04:01:44.469 --> 04:01:45.509
Okay.

04:01:45.509 --> 04:01:47.569
I'll lead everybody in.

04:01:47.569 --> 04:01:48.402
LAURA: Wow.

04:01:48.402 --> 04:01:51.912
LIAM: And walk up to whoever is at the front desk.

04:01:51.912 --> 04:01:53.141
MATT: Okay, you're welcome to the front desk

04:01:53.141 --> 04:01:58.110
and you see a human woman in her fifties or so,

04:01:58.110 --> 04:01:59.585
and you see a human woman in her fifties or so,

04:01:59.585 --> 04:02:01.659
hair that's gone gray at the roots that goes

04:02:01.659 --> 04:02:02.844
to a bit of red at the end.

04:02:02.844 --> 04:02:04.459
It's probably been a long time since either it was dyed,

04:02:04.459 --> 04:02:06.552
or the hair color's just faded over time.

04:02:07.389 --> 04:02:12.389
Very, very leathery skin that's seen a harsh life.

04:02:12.399 --> 04:02:14.329
She's sitting there at the edge with

04:02:14.329 --> 04:02:18.424
a big tankard and looks part way into her cups

04:02:18.424 --> 04:02:20.075
and turns to you. "Eh?"

04:02:21.119 --> 04:02:22.429
LIAM: Good evening.

04:02:22.429 --> 04:02:27.429
I know it's somewhat late, but there are--

04:02:27.829 --> 04:02:32.129
I'm going to need nine rooms for the evening,

04:02:32.129 --> 04:02:35.939
and in one of them, I specifically need a closet

04:02:35.939 --> 04:02:38.189
or, like, a wardrobe?

04:02:38.189 --> 04:02:40.539
I have a lot of luggage.

04:02:40.539 --> 04:02:43.239
Do you have something that can accommodate that?

04:02:43.239 --> 04:02:44.369
MATT: "Probably?"

04:02:44.369 --> 04:02:45.639
LIAM: Okay.

04:02:45.639 --> 04:02:46.472
MATT: "Right, right.

04:02:46.472 --> 04:02:48.109
"Nine rooms.

04:02:48.109 --> 04:02:49.409
"Closet."

04:02:49.409 --> 04:02:51.234
LIAM: In one of them, at least, <i>ja</i>.

04:02:51.234 --> 04:02:53.276
MATT: "There an extra charge for the closet."

04:02:53.276 --> 04:02:54.901
SAM: (giggles)

04:02:54.901 --> 04:02:57.619
LIAM: I think I can handle that--
MATT: "Closet fee."

04:02:57.619 --> 04:02:59.289
LIAM: I will pay your closet fee.

04:02:59.289 --> 04:03:00.972
MATT: "Right, right.

04:03:03.609 --> 04:03:06.289
"That'll run you two gold pieces,

04:03:06.289 --> 04:03:08.829
"including the closet fee."

04:03:08.829 --> 04:03:10.819
LIAM: Okay, I hand her--
MATT: "Final deal."

04:03:10.819 --> 04:03:12.452
LIAM: I give her three gold.

04:03:14.469 --> 04:03:15.302
MATT: "Right."

04:03:15.302 --> 04:03:17.039
LIAM: Which way?

04:03:17.039 --> 04:03:18.509
MATT: "This way.

04:03:18.509 --> 04:03:21.917
(yelling) "Sebastian, bring up the closet!"

04:03:21.917 --> 04:03:23.983
SAM: Bring up the closet?
MARISHA: The closet?

04:03:23.983 --> 04:03:25.391
MATT: There's a voice that acts like,

04:03:25.391 --> 04:03:27.366
(high-pitched) "What do you mean? [inaudible]"

04:03:27.366 --> 04:03:31.291
(as innkeeper) "Empty out the meats and
carry it upstairs for room 102!"

04:03:31.291 --> 04:03:33.481
SAM: (laughs)

04:03:33.481 --> 04:03:35.081
MATT: See this older man come out,

04:03:35.081 --> 04:03:37.369
this dirty face.

04:03:37.369 --> 04:03:38.717
Has been in the kitchen sweating.

04:03:38.717 --> 04:03:42.246
And he's like, "What do you mean empty out the meat closet?"

04:03:42.246 --> 04:03:44.257
Tosses a gold to him. "I said..."

04:03:44.257 --> 04:03:46.050
He goes, "Oh, all right."

04:03:47.109 --> 04:03:49.819
You hear a door open,

04:03:49.819 --> 04:03:50.949
and as you guys make your way out there,

04:03:50.949 --> 04:03:54.979
these rooms are... functional.

04:03:54.979 --> 04:03:58.339
LAURA: This is really nice, Caleb.
MATT: Each has a bed.

04:03:58.339 --> 04:03:59.917
LAURA: Thank you for bringing us here.

04:03:59.917 --> 04:04:01.584
SAM: Wonderful.

04:04:01.584 --> 04:04:04.026
LIAM: I tip Sebastian. Was that his name?

04:04:04.026 --> 04:04:06.149
MATT: Yeah.
LIAM: I tip Sebastian a silver.

04:04:06.149 --> 04:04:06.982
MATT: Okay.

04:04:06.982 --> 04:04:09.699
LIAM: And you know, before everyone heads to bed,

04:04:09.699 --> 04:04:13.199
just come in with me for a moment.

04:04:13.199 --> 04:04:15.761
I want to discuss one last thing.
MATT: (as Sebastian) "(grunts)"

04:04:15.761 --> 04:04:16.649
LAURA: You need some help?

04:04:16.649 --> 04:04:17.979
I'll go up and--
MATT: "I got it!

04:04:17.979 --> 04:04:19.645
"I got it."
LAURA: I'm going to help him.

04:04:19.645 --> 04:04:21.663
MATT: "No! Oh, fine."

04:04:21.663 --> 04:04:24.809
He takes it and you carry in this--

04:04:24.809 --> 04:04:26.189
LIAM: Is he carrying a whisper booth?

04:04:26.189 --> 04:04:27.239
What does he got?

04:04:27.239 --> 04:04:28.969
MATT: No, no, it's a--

04:04:28.969 --> 04:04:31.559
it's a wardrobe that had been fashioned

04:04:31.559 --> 04:04:34.769
as a meat storage rack in the kitchen downstairs,

04:04:34.769 --> 04:04:35.602
that has been emptied out.

04:04:35.602 --> 04:04:38.329
So it smells strongly of cured meats

04:04:38.329 --> 04:04:41.149
of various degrees of freshness,

04:04:41.149 --> 04:04:43.699
but it is a functional, empty wardrobe.

04:04:43.699 --> 04:04:44.532
LIAM: Amazing.

04:04:44.532 --> 04:04:46.669
SAM: I'm picturing, like, an IKEA Malm.

04:04:46.669 --> 04:04:49.102
(laughter)

04:04:49.102 --> 04:04:49.935
MATT: More or less.

04:04:49.935 --> 04:04:52.176
SAM: With just a bunch of blood on the bottom.

04:04:52.176 --> 04:04:55.899
MATT: Oh yeah, more or less. It is a stained interior.

04:04:55.899 --> 04:04:57.337
But it is placed in the room.

04:04:57.337 --> 04:04:59.919
"Thank you, kindly. Sleep well."

04:04:59.919 --> 04:05:01.819
And he heads off and shuffled his way back down the stairs.

04:05:01.819 --> 04:05:05.755
LIAM: Okay, I get the last of the
Nein in and I shut the door.

04:05:07.139 --> 04:05:09.049
Give me one second.

04:05:09.049 --> 04:05:13.419
And I open the door of this wardrobe closet, which smells,

04:05:13.419 --> 04:05:17.609
and I pull out the wand that Calianna gave me.

04:05:17.609 --> 04:05:20.329
And I look at the bottom of the wardrobe

04:05:20.329 --> 04:05:21.529
and there's a little hole,

04:05:21.529 --> 04:05:23.305
a little imperfection in the wood, a knot,

04:05:23.305 --> 04:05:25.459
and I stick the wand into that hole

04:05:25.459 --> 04:05:27.311
so it's standing up

04:05:27.311 --> 04:05:30.459
and then I pull out several pieces of stained glass

04:05:30.459 --> 04:05:32.599
and arrange them just so,

04:05:32.599 --> 04:05:37.089
and I take out a small piece of slate and put-- excuse me,

04:05:37.089 --> 04:05:38.939
granite, and put that on the ground,

04:05:38.939 --> 04:05:42.439
and that little wooden cat that I had fabricated,

04:05:42.439 --> 04:05:44.909
I put on top of the granite

04:05:44.909 --> 04:05:49.109
and I then began to use chalk to draw around those.

04:05:49.109 --> 04:05:53.219
And I draw a solid line behind that wand

04:05:53.219 --> 04:05:55.289
and start to utter words

04:05:55.289 --> 04:05:57.779
and a moment of this

04:05:57.779 --> 04:06:01.187
and that chalk line begins to glow a thin golden amber color

04:06:01.187 --> 04:06:04.745
and that chalk line begins to glow a thin golden amber color

04:06:04.745 --> 04:06:09.676
and a rectangle of amber shimmers up from that line.

04:06:09.676 --> 04:06:11.659
and a rectangle of amber shimmers up from that line.

04:06:11.659 --> 04:06:15.019
And the amber begins to waver

04:06:15.019 --> 04:06:19.169
and past it, you see just the barest glimpse

04:06:19.169 --> 04:06:24.169
of windows of stained glass stretching up into the air.

04:06:24.449 --> 04:06:27.979
And I say: Welcome home.

04:06:27.979 --> 04:06:29.029
And I walk in.

04:06:29.029 --> 04:06:29.981
SAM: Ooh.

04:06:31.660 --> 04:06:32.609
TALIESIN: I'm walking in.

04:06:32.609 --> 04:06:35.679
LAURA: Same, same, same, same.
SAM: Let's go. Let's go.

04:06:35.679 --> 04:06:39.929
MATT: As you all step into the wardrobe to follow Caleb

04:06:39.929 --> 04:06:43.379
into whatever strange realm he seems

04:06:43.379 --> 04:06:45.569
to have called you into,

04:06:45.569 --> 04:06:47.382
we're going to go ahead and call the episode for the night.

04:06:47.382 --> 04:06:48.582
(exclamations)

04:06:48.582 --> 04:06:49.944
TRAVIS: What did you do?

04:06:49.944 --> 04:06:50.777
ASHLEY: What is this?

04:06:50.777 --> 04:06:51.610
SAM: He kills us all.

04:06:51.610 --> 04:06:53.327
TRAVIS: Cat scratch closet.

04:06:53.327 --> 04:06:55.577
(laughter)

04:06:56.779 --> 04:06:58.996
MATT: Yeah, we'll pick up there next episode.

04:07:01.610 --> 04:07:04.269
You get to think on your description.

04:07:04.269 --> 04:07:06.519
I'm sure you're thinking on it for a while, but anyway.

04:07:06.519 --> 04:07:08.239
Thank you all so much for joining us.

04:07:08.239 --> 04:07:09.969
Hope you enjoyed it as much we did.

04:07:09.969 --> 04:07:13.507
We love you very much and is it Thursday yet?

04:07:13.507 --> 04:07:14.404
Good night.
LIAM: No!

00:00:00.511 --> 00:00:02.396
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode

2
00:00:02.396 --> 00:00:04.459
of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

3
00:00:04.459 --> 00:00:05.896
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

4
00:00:05.896 --> 00:00:08.640
ALL: We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

5
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.610
MATT: We are in our last episode of 2019.

6
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:12.443
SAM: Oh.
ASHLEY: What?

7
00:00:12.443 --> 00:00:14.955
MATT: Yeah, last session before we
leave for the holidays, so--

8
00:00:14.955 --> 00:00:16.371
ASHLEY: But I just got here.
MATT: I know.

9
00:00:16.371 --> 00:00:18.368
We'll be back next year.
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.

10
00:00:18.368 --> 00:00:19.391
MATT: Which is only in a few weeks.

11
00:00:19.391 --> 00:00:21.769
LIAM: Just 12 more months.
MATT: Exactly.

12
00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:24.129
But before we get into tonight's session, we do have

13
00:00:24.129 --> 00:00:26.009
some announcements to get through, beginning with

14
00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:28.430
the first of our two fantastic sponsors for the evening,

15
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.859
a returning friend of the show, Backblaze!

16
00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:32.499
ALL: Backblaze!

17
00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:33.962
MATT: Sam, if you don't mind?
SAM: This episode

18
00:00:33.962 --> 00:00:36.547
is sponsored by our good friends at Backblaze.

19
00:00:36.547 --> 00:00:41.409
Yev is in the studio hawking their premium backup technology

20
00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:44.660
for both Mac and PC, unlimited online backup

21
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.426
for all your fanfic, docs, artwork,

22
00:00:47.426 --> 00:00:50.284
music, pics, vids--

23
00:00:50.284 --> 00:00:51.878
that's how the kids say it

24
00:00:51.878 --> 00:00:54.270
and it starts at just six dollars a month.

25
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.732
You can also recover files from anywhere on the go

26
00:00:56.732 --> 00:01:00.269
and they go directly to the iOS or Android app

27
00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:02.510
or you can order a hard drive with all your stuff

28
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.681
and Backblaze will ship it to you overnight.

29
00:01:04.681 --> 00:01:07.281
Which reminds me, I recently had

30
00:01:07.281 --> 00:01:11.508
a computer hard drive crash and they sent me my hard drive

31
00:01:11.508 --> 00:01:13.700
and while I was restoring everything,

32
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.518
getting it back up and running, I found an old file

33
00:01:16.518 --> 00:01:18.579
that I had forgotten about from far away.

34
00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:21.168
I was shocked to find an old script

35
00:01:21.168 --> 00:01:24.419
for an anime trailer that was produced in the mid 90s.

36
00:01:24.419 --> 00:01:29.408
Turns out a Japanese studio did an anime-style remake

37
00:01:29.408 --> 00:01:31.077
of Gale Force Five,

38
00:01:31.077 --> 00:01:35.139
you know, the popular film starring sitcom icon, Gale,

39
00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:37.543
as played as Ashley Johnson.

40
00:01:37.543 --> 00:01:42.395
Now, this was an animated remake so some of the things

41
00:01:42.395 --> 00:01:46.203
won't seem as familiar to an American audience.

42
00:01:46.203 --> 00:01:48.062
ASHLEY: I forgot that I was the one that starred in this.

43
00:01:48.062 --> 00:01:49.562
SAM: You did do this.

44
00:01:50.593 --> 00:01:54.763
SAM: But I thought--
LIAM: It's your responsibility.

45
00:01:54.763 --> 00:01:57.443
SAM: But I thought we could just do a dramatic reading

46
00:01:57.443 --> 00:01:59.449
of the trailer script that I found on my hard drive,

47
00:01:59.449 --> 00:02:03.899
thanks to Backblaze, and it's just for the people at home.

48
00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.000
Yeah, so you guys have some scripts to read

49
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.049
and there'll be some musical accompaniment.

50
00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:09.491
And you know what?

51
00:02:09.491 --> 00:02:11.312
Let's take it away, guys!

52
00:02:11.312 --> 00:02:12.661
(sinister music)

53
00:02:12.661 --> 00:02:17.150
LIAM: From the studio that brought
you Mobile Virgin Boy Senpai,

54
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.552
Mega Princess Bluesy Shippuden, and Kazaam,

55
00:02:21.552 --> 00:02:25.643
comes a brand new anime adventure. Mid 90s.

56
00:02:25.643 --> 00:02:28.352
MATT: Gale-kun, you're a transfer student.

57
00:02:28.352 --> 00:02:31.222
Want to get some ramen at the Maid Cafe?

58
00:02:31.222 --> 00:02:34.140
ASHLEY: I want to, but I've been feelin' strange powers

59
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.492
growing inside me and I need to do my best to discover

60
00:02:37.492 --> 00:02:41.521
my hidden destiny below the cram school, huh?

61
00:02:41.521 --> 00:02:42.354
MATT: Nani?

62
00:02:43.234 --> 00:02:44.447
(laughter)

63
00:02:44.447 --> 00:02:48.485
LIAM: An ordinary girl with a pet cat named Neko

64
00:02:48.485 --> 00:02:50.516
and a powerful secret.

65
00:02:50.516 --> 00:02:51.644
MARISHA: (screams)

66
00:02:51.644 --> 00:02:54.956
A giant alien robot is attacking the hot springs!

67
00:02:54.956 --> 00:02:58.289
Our club meeting is ruined, oh!

68
00:02:59.354 --> 00:03:01.093
ASHLEY: I need to stop them.

69
00:03:01.093 --> 00:03:05.643
I call on you, Ultimate Kaneko Vampire Stalker,

70
00:03:05.643 --> 00:03:08.276
unleash my final form!

71
00:03:08.276 --> 00:03:11.164
(laughter)

72
00:03:11.164 --> 00:03:14.444
LIAM: With the power of friendship, Gale can transform into

73
00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:18.162
a mecha mutant student council vice president.

74
00:03:18.162 --> 00:03:22.882
LAURA: You will never defeat me, Gale-san. (evil laugh)

75
00:03:22.882 --> 00:03:26.793
For I am Hender-san, a four-story tall Gundam

76
00:03:26.793 --> 00:03:30.476
and you are a helpless high school junior with a nosebleed!

77
00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:33.895
ASHLEY: Gag me with a chopstick, Hender-san!

78
00:03:33.895 --> 00:03:35.970
Rah!

79
00:03:36.975 --> 00:03:38.483
LIAM: Coming to theaters,

80
00:03:38.483 --> 00:03:43.093
it's Her Miracle Bebop NeoGale 2047.

81
00:03:43.093 --> 00:03:45.625
This winter, get Galed.

82
00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:47.391
TRAVIS: Ooh!

83
00:03:47.391 --> 00:03:50.348
SAM: Very nice, guys. Very nice.

84
00:03:50.348 --> 00:03:51.476
ASHLEY: I would remember this.

85
00:03:51.476 --> 00:03:53.247
SAM: You would have watched that in the mid 90s.

86
00:03:53.247 --> 00:03:55.657
LAURA: I would have watched that--
SAM: Had they ever made it.

87
00:03:55.657 --> 00:03:57.801
LAURA: Yeah, I feel like it--

88
00:03:57.801 --> 00:03:59.963
TRAVIS: Your anime reactions are tip-top.

89
00:03:59.963 --> 00:04:01.850
TALIESIN: That was solid, that was solid.

90
00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.600
ASHLEY: I have a lot of experience, so.

91
00:04:05.963 --> 00:04:07.854
SAM: But thanks to Backblaze for helping me find

92
00:04:07.854 --> 00:04:10.003

MATT: I'm excited for the Kojima
remake of that in seven years.

103
00:04:34.961 --> 00:04:37.957
LIAM: Look, man, those last 15
years have to be for something.

104

SAM: I haven't heard that rendition yet.

124
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.515
TRAVIS: Ashley just woke up.

125
00:05:29.515 --> 00:05:31.667
(laughter)

126
00:05:31.667 --> 00:05:34.975
ASHLEY: Everything sounds bad because my voice right now.

I'm going to be singing all night.

128

Nothing like a good friend.

00:05:57.221 --> 00:05:59.152
Yesterday, we hosted our special End of the Year

136
00:05:59.152 --> 00:06:01.333
Fireside Chat here on our Critical Role Twitch channel.

137
00:06:01.333 --> 00:06:03.861
A bunch of us showed up in comfy clothes,

138
00:06:03.861 --> 00:06:06.368
chatted with chat, answered some questions

139
00:06:06.368 --> 00:06:11.118
and then played a bunch of Jackbox, which was ridiculous.

140
00:06:12.312 --> 00:06:14.554
But yeah, if you missed the livestream, the VOD's available

We're also off for the next two weeks for the holiday break.

160
00:07:07.364 --> 00:07:10.114
We're going to be taking some time for ourselves,

161
00:07:10.114 --> 00:07:13.503
for our families, and a lot of sleep.

162
00:07:13.503 --> 00:07:14.933
TRAVIS: I'm going to kill Santa!

163
00:07:14.933 --> 00:07:17.170

164
00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:20.204

165
00:07:20.204 --> 00:07:21.649
MATT: Bloodshed's still needed.

166
00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:24.001
TRAVIS: (elderly voice) You should've killed me
when you had the chance!

167
00:07:24.001 --> 00:07:26.971
(laughter)

168
00:07:26.971 --> 00:07:28.540
MATT: Okay, that took a turn.

169
00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:31.799

I know, I know, we're all hitting that wall. (laughs)

173
00:07:43.555 --> 00:07:46.077
But thank you guys so much for your amazing support

174
00:07:46.077 --> 00:07:48.176
of everything that we've been trying to do

175
00:07:48.176 --> 00:07:49.747
and build here at the channel.

176
00:07:49.747 --> 00:07:52.757
We've got a bunch of really exciting things to show you guys

177
00:07:52.757 --> 00:07:54.888
coming very soon in the new year.

178
00:07:54.888 --> 00:07:58.768
I can't wait to do so, but have a wonderful magical holiday.

179
00:07:58.768 --> 00:08:00.627
Rock it out, we'll see you guys in 2020,

180
00:08:00.627 --> 00:08:04.416
but first we do have an episode to get to.

181
00:08:04.416 --> 00:08:06.461
But Travis, you have an announcement.

182
00:08:06.461 --> 00:08:08.397
TRAVIS: Oh, yes, some of you have noticed that some

183
00:08:08.397 --> 00:08:11.507
of our content has started migrating over to our official

184
00:08:11.507 --> 00:08:14.289
CR channels and that takes just a little bit of time,

185
00:08:14.289 --> 00:08:16.526
because our content is pretty long.

186
00:08:16.526 --> 00:08:17.359
MARISHA: It's real long.

187
00:08:17.359 --> 00:08:18.286
TRAVIS: So it takes just a little bit.

188
00:08:18.286 --> 00:08:21.563
We promise we will get it to you as soon as possible,

189
00:08:21.563 --> 00:08:23.963
a couple days, hopefully, and we thank you very much

190
00:08:23.963 --> 00:08:26.093
for your patience. Love ya!

191
00:08:26.093 --> 00:08:27.021
MARISHA: Ding!

192
00:08:27.021 --> 00:08:27.854
TRAVIS: Ding!

193
00:08:27.854 --> 00:08:28.981
MARISHA: Ding!

194
00:08:28.981 --> 00:08:31.613
MATT: All righty, so with that being said, let's go ahead

195
00:08:31.613 --> 00:08:36.604
and jump into tonight's episode of Critical Role.

196
00:08:38.496 --> 00:08:40.896

(dragon roars)

233
00:10:14.808 --> 00:10:16.406
MATT: Welcome back.

234
00:10:16.406 --> 00:10:17.968
(laughter)

235
00:10:17.968 --> 00:10:19.135
Motherfuckers.

236
00:10:20.227 --> 00:10:23.152
Last we left off, the Mighty Nein,

237
00:10:23.152 --> 00:10:25.262
after having their showdown

238
00:10:25.262 --> 00:10:27.270
with the Cult of the Angel of Irons,

239
00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:30.906
destroying Obann, the Laughing Hand, and freeing Yasha

240
00:10:30.906 --> 00:10:34.486
and the Inevitable End from his influence.

241
00:10:34.486 --> 00:10:38.154
You were taken to the throne room of King Dwendal.

242
00:10:38.154 --> 00:10:41.836
And upon meeting members of his council and the assembly,

243
00:10:41.836 --> 00:10:45.265
you were tasked to prove yourselves a bit

244
00:10:45.265 --> 00:10:50.265
by helping at least bring some sort of arrangement

245
00:10:50.356 --> 00:10:53.665
between them and the dynasty together

246
00:10:53.665 --> 00:10:57.113
to essentially help ford a possible peace talk

247
00:10:57.113 --> 00:10:59.931
or negotiation in this conflict that's been going on for

248
00:10:59.931 --> 00:11:02.444
quite some time, based on the relationship that you have

249
00:11:02.444 --> 00:11:05.653
seemingly built with the Bright Queen.

250
00:11:05.653 --> 00:11:08.792
You were brought under Ludinus Da'leth, the Martinet

251
00:11:08.792 --> 00:11:12.402
and oldest member of the Assembly,

252
00:11:12.402 --> 00:11:14.951
who then spoke with you in his private quarters

253
00:11:14.951 --> 00:11:17.490
about elements of the conflict,

254
00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:20.478
some of the source of the tension that has led

255
00:11:20.478 --> 00:11:24.667
and eventually brewed into the war that broke out.

256
00:11:24.667 --> 00:11:27.265
You were given a little bit of guidance as to how much

257
00:11:27.265 --> 00:11:31.178
you were to guide the next step in this.

258
00:11:31.178 --> 00:11:33.595
You then went back to your...

259
00:11:34.506 --> 00:11:37.172
Or, you were asked, as part of this arrangement,

260
00:11:37.172 --> 00:11:41.024
to inspect the beacon that was supposedly found

261
00:11:41.024 --> 00:11:42.906
by the word of Trent Ikithon.

262
00:11:42.906 --> 00:11:45.128
As such, you were brought by Ludinus

263
00:11:45.128 --> 00:11:47.777
to the Vergessen Sanatorium,

264
00:11:47.777 --> 00:11:51.970
a hidden structure somewhere in the northern elements

265
00:11:51.970 --> 00:11:54.235
of Western Wynandir, where you were brought

266
00:11:54.235 --> 00:11:56.248
to a subterranean research facility,

267
00:11:56.248 --> 00:11:58.827
where you met Trent Ikithon as well as two of his Scourgers,

268
00:11:58.827 --> 00:12:02.227
one of which was familiar to Caleb.

269
00:12:03.067 --> 00:12:06.328
You inspected it, found it to seemingly be, indeed,

270
00:12:06.328 --> 00:12:08.509
an actual beacon.

271
00:12:08.509 --> 00:12:12.926
Had a bit of a tense back and forth interrogation via

272
00:12:14.078 --> 00:12:19.078
conversation, and then upon returning to Rexxentrum,

273
00:12:19.118 --> 00:12:22.387
began to forge a few paths with the time that you had given.

274
00:12:22.387 --> 00:12:24.619
It was up to you as to when to choose to engage

275
00:12:24.619 --> 00:12:26.339
and begin these negotiations.

276
00:12:26.339 --> 00:12:29.158
There was no timeline set, but time is of the essence,

277
00:12:29.158 --> 00:12:32.278
for the more time that goes by, the higher chance there is

278
00:12:32.278 --> 00:12:36.016
of this temporary ceasefire to be broken.

279
00:12:36.016 --> 00:12:40.507
So you guys, after voicing a few possible interests

280
00:12:40.507 --> 00:12:43.090
here in the city of Rexxentrum,

281
00:12:44.565 --> 00:12:47.315
you now stand in your chambers, we'll say,

282
00:12:47.315 --> 00:12:49.723
within the Camarouth Cottage,

283
00:12:49.723 --> 00:12:52.324
figuring out what to do with the time you have.

284
00:12:52.324 --> 00:12:55.533
So Mighty Nein, after venturing back from

285
00:12:55.533 --> 00:13:00.533
some purchasing at a nearby creepy store

286
00:13:00.724 --> 00:13:02.275
and having some conversation about

287
00:13:02.275 --> 00:13:04.503
what the next order of business is,

288
00:13:04.503 --> 00:13:08.126
you are still gathered and the city is yours.

289
00:13:08.126 --> 00:13:10.293
What would you like to do?

290
00:13:11.819 --> 00:13:16.819
TALIESIN: I'm going to spend a couple
days working on my bone flute.

291
00:13:17.266 --> 00:13:18.547
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, that's good.

292
00:13:18.547 --> 00:13:19.706
SAM: Your bone flute?

293
00:13:19.706 --> 00:13:20.714
Oh, that's right.

294
00:13:20.714 --> 00:13:22.354
MATT: That's the new euphemism.

295
00:13:22.354 --> 00:13:24.112
MARISHA: Workin' on your bone flute.

296
00:13:24.112 --> 00:13:26.267
TALIESIN: I was looking forward to that right there.

297
00:13:26.267 --> 00:13:29.416
ASHLEY: I would like to find a garden somewhere

298
00:13:29.416 --> 00:13:33.518
and start reading my book

299
00:13:33.518 --> 00:13:36.238
as much as I can for the next couple days,

300
00:13:36.238 --> 00:13:38.571
and then also maybe get some

301
00:13:40.047 --> 00:13:43.630
therapy at night, by going to some fighting

302
00:13:44.807 --> 00:13:48.495
with peoples, but we'll figure that out.

303
00:13:48.495 --> 00:13:51.617
But I would like to get as much reading in as I can.

304
00:13:51.617 --> 00:13:52.450
MATT: Okay.

305
00:13:53.988 --> 00:13:56.747
All right, so, easy enough to find a garden, actually.

306
00:13:56.747 --> 00:13:58.427
In the Shimmer Ward, where you guys are staying,

307
00:13:58.427 --> 00:14:00.848
there are a number of public gardens that are just

308
00:14:00.848 --> 00:14:04.478
out for general meandering for those who

309
00:14:04.478 --> 00:14:06.637
live in the space or are guests of it.

310
00:14:06.637 --> 00:14:10.067
So not too far from the cottage where you guys are staying,

311
00:14:10.067 --> 00:14:13.234
you find one beautiful kind of, almost

312
00:14:14.715 --> 00:14:17.755
five-pointed pentagonal garden

313
00:14:17.755 --> 00:14:22.755
that has these various intersecting walking paths

314
00:14:23.006 --> 00:14:24.684
made of beautiful cobblestones

315
00:14:24.684 --> 00:14:28.435
and larger stones that situate themselves

316
00:14:28.435 --> 00:14:30.694
between art sculptures and statues

317
00:14:30.694 --> 00:14:32.824
and some trees that rise up.

318
00:14:32.824 --> 00:14:37.606
It's very beautiful and a contrast to a lot of the

319
00:14:37.606 --> 00:14:40.045
areas of Rexxentrum on the outskirts of this

320
00:14:40.045 --> 00:14:41.725
particular region.

321
00:14:41.725 --> 00:14:43.544
But you can take some time to read your book.

322
00:14:43.544 --> 00:14:46.663
How much time would you like to take?

323
00:14:46.663 --> 00:14:49.813
ASHLEY: (sighs) Let's see.

324
00:14:49.813 --> 00:14:51.422
Let me think about that.

325
00:14:51.422 --> 00:14:52.255
MATT: Okay.

326
00:14:53.183 --> 00:14:55.905
All right, you're working on your bone flute.

327
00:14:55.905 --> 00:14:58.441
TALIESIN: It sounds-- it's a
death whistle, basically.

328
00:14:58.441 --> 00:15:00.099
You've just handed me.
MATT: Yeah, yeah.

329
00:15:00.099 --> 00:15:00.932
TRAVIS: That's amazing.

330
00:15:00.932 --> 00:15:04.765
TALIESIN: Just sitting in probably another park and...

331
00:15:05.968 --> 00:15:09.708
(ragged high-pitched scream)
(laughter)

332
00:15:09.708 --> 00:15:11.130
MATT: For those who haven't heard--

333
00:15:11.130 --> 00:15:14.076
LAURA: The same park. Yasha's like--

334
00:15:14.076 --> 00:15:16.398
LAURA: I just keep moving.
MATT: I believe it was the Aztec.

335
00:15:16.398 --> 00:15:18.966
The Aztec death whistle.

336
00:15:18.966 --> 00:15:20.645
LIAM: It just sounds like goats screaming.

337
00:15:20.645 --> 00:15:23.516
MATT: Yeah, yeah, it's meant
to sound like a person

338
00:15:23.516 --> 00:15:25.945
screaming in a shrill voice
and they would have many

339
00:15:25.945 --> 00:15:28.326
many of them supposedly blowing at once

340
00:15:28.326 --> 00:15:31.601
as they were charging into battle
as an intimidation tactic.

341
00:15:31.601 --> 00:15:35.055
They carved a skull so you could blow in the back of.

342
00:15:35.055 --> 00:15:36.774
It's awesome.

343
00:15:36.774 --> 00:15:38.476
TALIESIN: It's amazing.
MATT: It's rad, yeah.

344
00:15:38.476 --> 00:15:40.897
TRAVIS: I meant to ask you, by the way,
the the little symbol

345
00:15:40.897 --> 00:15:42.695
that you gave me, it's made of seaweed

346
00:15:42.695 --> 00:15:44.542
and you said it had a blue crystal in it.

347
00:15:44.542 --> 00:15:45.964
TALIESIN: Yeah, like blue glass.

348
00:15:45.964 --> 00:15:47.284
TRAVIS: Oh, beautiful, okay.

349
00:15:47.284 --> 00:15:49.295
LAURA: Is it actually made of seaweed?

350
00:15:49.295 --> 00:15:52.794
TALIESIN: No, it's copper and steel
and the copper is is patina'ed and green.

351
00:15:52.794 --> 00:15:54.785
TRAVIS: It's not like expensive sapphire or anything?

352
00:15:54.785 --> 00:15:57.234
TALIESIN: No, no, it's glass. I don't have that shit.

353
00:15:57.234 --> 00:16:00.140
TRAVIS: Blue glass.
TALIESIN: What am I, made of money?

354
00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:01.612
TRAVIS: Cool.

355
00:16:01.612 --> 00:16:04.160
TALIESIN: I'll draw you a little picture.

356
00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.882
MATT: As you're reading intensely
through your book, Yasha,

357
00:16:06.882 --> 00:16:09.611
every 20 or so minutes, you'll hear this distant

358
00:16:09.611 --> 00:16:13.332
high-pitched shrill sound that catches you off guard

359
00:16:13.332 --> 00:16:16.159
and as you turn to look, your adrenaline briefly pumping,

360
00:16:16.159 --> 00:16:18.578
you remember that's Caduceus practicing.

361
00:16:18.578 --> 00:16:20.520
ASHLEY: (muffled) ♪ Got the perfect warlock ♪

362
00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:23.254
(laughter)

363
00:16:23.254 --> 00:16:24.337
MATT: It's weird.

364
00:16:26.614 --> 00:16:29.184
Who else is doing anything particular

365
00:16:29.184 --> 00:16:31.064
over the next period of time?

366
00:16:31.064 --> 00:16:32.639
LAURA: I want to...

367
00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:36.590
Scry on Kiri,

368
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:37.698
and see how she's doing.

369
00:16:37.698 --> 00:16:39.483
TRAVIS: Oh shit. Way back.
MATT: Okay.

370
00:16:39.483 --> 00:16:43.008
So you go ahead and focus a bit.

371
00:16:44.515 --> 00:16:48.145
SAM: It's just like a big turkey dinner, like--

372
00:16:48.145 --> 00:16:50.062
LAURA: Don't!
MATT: You're horrible!

373
00:16:50.062 --> 00:16:52.903
You are a terrible person!
(laughter)

374
00:16:52.903 --> 00:16:54.969
LAURA: Happy Thanksgiving!

375
00:16:57.446 --> 00:16:59.827
MATT: As you are taking some time in your own chambers,

376
00:16:59.827 --> 00:17:03.275
your private chambers here in the cottage,

377
00:17:03.275 --> 00:17:06.634
placing these symbols on the
ground and focusing intently

378
00:17:06.634 --> 00:17:09.644
on Kiri's whereabouts,
you feel your consciousness

379
00:17:09.644 --> 00:17:12.554
extend a bit into the clouds above

380
00:17:12.554 --> 00:17:15.964
before rushing down towards the Overlooks,

381
00:17:15.964 --> 00:17:20.772
the mountain cliff sides of the Silberquel Ridge

382
00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:24.467
down into Upper Hupperdook.

383
00:17:24.467 --> 00:17:26.691
SAM: Upper Hupper.
MATT: Upper Hupper, if you will.

384
00:17:26.691 --> 00:17:28.329
(laughter)

385
00:17:28.329 --> 00:17:31.910
Glancing towards it, last memory you can recall,

386
00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:34.248
there appears to be quite a bit of damage

387
00:17:34.248 --> 00:17:36.017
that Upper Hupperdook has sustained.

388
00:17:36.017 --> 00:17:39.825
LAURA: Up Hup.
MATT: Up Hup, as the kids call it.

389
00:17:39.825 --> 00:17:41.567
Hanging out in Up Hup.

390
00:17:41.567 --> 00:17:43.399
TALIESIN: It's good branding for property value.

391
00:17:43.399 --> 00:17:45.867
MARISHA: It's got the stacked letters, just in block.

392
00:17:45.867 --> 00:17:49.950
LIAM: It's so gentrified, I prefer Down Dook, though.

393
00:17:50.947 --> 00:17:54.864
MATT: Downward Dook?
(laughter)

394
00:17:56.175 --> 00:17:57.696
MARISHA: Do Du?

395
00:17:57.696 --> 00:17:58.794
LAURA: Do Du.
TALIESIN: Do Du.

396
00:17:58.794 --> 00:18:01.675
MATT: As you try and wrestle your concentration

397
00:18:01.675 --> 00:18:04.075
during this scry from the various terms

398
00:18:04.075 --> 00:18:07.094
that make their way through your brain, Jester,

399
00:18:07.094 --> 00:18:09.834
you can see the damage that-- you had heard

400
00:18:09.834 --> 00:18:13.485
of some sort of attack that had come to Hupperdook.

401
00:18:13.485 --> 00:18:15.044
It doesn't look terribly recent,

402
00:18:15.044 --> 00:18:17.564
but there is small levels of construction

403
00:18:17.564 --> 00:18:19.056
that are beginning to spring up again.

404
00:18:19.056 --> 00:18:22.592
The city is reclaiming itself in those regions.

405
00:18:22.592 --> 00:18:26.692
And with a flash, there is a sight of a

406
00:18:27.532 --> 00:18:30.591
dark-feathered young girl

407
00:18:30.591 --> 00:18:33.561
making her way through the street, hood up, cloak on,

408
00:18:33.561 --> 00:18:36.503
holding arms filled with

409
00:18:36.503 --> 00:18:40.383
partially-stale bread, a small basket with some--

410
00:18:40.383 --> 00:18:42.962
a little piece of cloth wrapped over it.

411
00:18:42.962 --> 00:18:46.709
And she's walking along, darting from shadows,

412
00:18:46.709 --> 00:18:49.167
shaded corner to shaded corner as not to call

413
00:18:49.167 --> 00:18:50.229
too much attention before--

414
00:18:50.229 --> 00:18:52.229
LAURA: Does she look too skinny or does she look

415
00:18:52.229 --> 00:18:54.258
like she's eating okay?

416
00:18:54.258 --> 00:18:55.866
MATT: She looks healthy.

417
00:18:55.866 --> 00:18:56.987
LAURA: Okay, okay.

418
00:18:56.987 --> 00:19:00.484
MATT: She's not withering by any means.

419
00:19:00.484 --> 00:19:03.226
But she's also covered with feathers, but as best

420
00:19:03.226 --> 00:19:06.574
as you can guess, she doesn't seem any worse for wear.

421
00:19:06.574 --> 00:19:08.113
As you--
LAURA: Yeah, is she molting?

422
00:19:08.113 --> 00:19:13.113
MATT: --follow her for a bit,
returning to same abandoned butchery

423
00:19:13.119 --> 00:19:15.574
where you had encountered the family that had agreed

424
00:19:15.574 --> 00:19:20.157
to take care of her, the place has been far spruced up.

425
00:19:21.043 --> 00:19:24.524
Whereas previously it was just a boarded shut locale

426
00:19:24.524 --> 00:19:28.323
filled with dust and abandoned pieces of furniture,

427
00:19:28.323 --> 00:19:31.150
many of which was either in disuse or broken.

428
00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:33.423
You watch as she comes into the door in the inside

429
00:19:33.423 --> 00:19:36.948
and it feels more like little more of a home.

430
00:19:38.485 --> 00:19:40.485
You see her bring the bread and place it on the counter

431
00:19:40.485 --> 00:19:42.903
and break it apart and look around.

432
00:19:42.903 --> 00:19:45.440
Nobody else is home yet, so she grabs a piece and

433
00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:49.939
sits on a stool, and like (chomps) begins eating it quietly,

434
00:19:49.939 --> 00:19:51.196
but she seems okay.

435
00:19:51.196 --> 00:19:54.334
LAURA: Oh, that's good, that's good, that's good.

436
00:19:54.334 --> 00:19:55.806
Okay.

437
00:19:55.806 --> 00:19:58.254
MATT: The 10 minutes of the scry
wear off and that's the extent

438
00:19:58.254 --> 00:19:59.713
of the vision you have.

439
00:19:59.713 --> 00:20:02.860
LAURA: I could use some bread. That made me hungry.

440
00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:06.302
I'm going to get some bread, eat it,

441
00:20:06.302 --> 00:20:09.493
and then I'm going to send message to...

442
00:20:09.493 --> 00:20:11.059
the Plank King.

443
00:20:11.059 --> 00:20:13.032
MATT: (laughs)
SAM: Wait, what?

444
00:20:13.032 --> 00:20:16.707
TRAVIS: Are you fucking really?
Oh my god.

445
00:20:17.594 --> 00:20:18.427
TALIESIN: Boom.

446
00:20:19.521 --> 00:20:21.062
MATT: All right.

447
00:20:21.062 --> 00:20:22.182
Hold on.

448
00:20:22.182 --> 00:20:23.015
SAM: Wow.

449
00:20:23.015 --> 00:20:27.561
LIAM: Cogs slowly whirring to life
in Matt's head in the back.

450
00:20:27.561 --> 00:20:28.647
TRAVIS: Oh, god.

451
00:20:28.647 --> 00:20:32.714
MARISHA: Oh, wait, what? (laughs)

452
00:20:32.714 --> 00:20:36.412
TALIESIN: Wow, you've sent the DM down a file hole.

453
00:20:36.412 --> 00:20:37.886
TRAVIS: Going through binders.

454
00:20:37.886 --> 00:20:41.333
MATT: Okay, what do you send to The Plank King?

455
00:20:41.333 --> 00:20:44.314
LAURA: Hi, Plank King!
SAM: (laughs)

456
00:20:44.314 --> 00:20:46.981
LAURA: It's Jester, do you remember me?

457
00:20:47.962 --> 00:20:49.922
How are things going there?

458
00:20:49.922 --> 00:20:51.882
We miss you.

459
00:20:51.882 --> 00:20:54.582
Are you guys causing crimes and stuff?

460
00:20:55.973 --> 00:20:57.306
How's your hair?

461
00:20:58.871 --> 00:20:59.930
You pooping?

462
00:21:01.102 --> 00:21:04.102
TALIESIN: That's actually, I think, dead on.

463
00:21:07.161 --> 00:21:09.361
MATT: At first you think it may not
have found its source

464
00:21:09.361 --> 00:21:11.172
from the protracted silence.

465
00:21:11.172 --> 00:21:13.761
TRAVIS: That's such a fucked spell.

466
00:21:13.761 --> 00:21:15.988
It can fucking just hit you at any time.

467
00:21:15.988 --> 00:21:17.768
MATT: It's pretty fucked up, man.

468
00:21:17.768 --> 00:21:19.517
(laughter)

469
00:21:19.517 --> 00:21:20.658
TRAVIS: Make it stop!

470
00:21:20.658 --> 00:21:22.938
MATT: I never thought of it in the "wrong hands"

471
00:21:22.938 --> 00:21:27.852
until it was in the "wrong hands" and it's fascinating.

472
00:21:27.852 --> 00:21:29.968
TRAVIS: This fucking tiefling, jesus!

473
00:21:31.019 --> 00:21:32.652
God damn, that's her!

474
00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:36.650
ASHLEY: You just hear "hello!"

475
00:21:39.318 --> 00:21:42.151
MATT: A voice comes back and goes,

476
00:21:43.317 --> 00:21:45.442
"I am not

477
00:21:45.442 --> 00:21:49.275
"really certain who this is,

478
00:21:52.225 --> 00:21:56.066
"but business has been business.

479
00:22:00.338 --> 00:22:02.413
"Why do you ask?"

480
00:22:02.413 --> 00:22:04.533
And that's the only response you get.

481
00:22:04.533 --> 00:22:07.333
You didn't have a lot of
interaction with the Plank King

482
00:22:07.333 --> 00:22:11.241
and you gather he's genuinely unsure who this is.

483
00:22:11.241 --> 00:22:12.361
LAURA: I like it.

484
00:22:12.361 --> 00:22:13.291
SAM: You said Jester.

485
00:22:13.291 --> 00:22:16.299
LAURA: I know, he should remember me.

486
00:22:16.299 --> 00:22:17.132
All right.

487
00:22:19.549 --> 00:22:22.082
I'm going to send a message...

488
00:22:22.082 --> 00:22:25.088
to Beau's dad.
SAM: The Tal'Dorei Council.

489
00:22:25.088 --> 00:22:27.019
TRAVIS: To Beau's dad?
SAM: Okay.

490
00:22:27.019 --> 00:22:28.858
MARISHA: Wait, what now?

491
00:22:28.858 --> 00:22:33.058
SAM: This checklist is crazy.
TALIESIN: I'm so happy.

492
00:22:33.058 --> 00:22:35.696
MATT: Sending is dangerous.

493
00:22:35.696 --> 00:22:38.738
LAURA: (deep voice) How are things going there?

494
00:22:39.709 --> 00:22:42.909
Did you heed my warnings before?

495
00:22:44.287 --> 00:22:46.837
We are keeping eyes on you.

496
00:22:48.698 --> 00:22:51.939
(hums menacingly)

497
00:22:51.939 --> 00:22:53.357
Hm hm hm.

498
00:22:53.357 --> 00:22:55.940
(laughter)

499
00:22:58.955 --> 00:22:59.980
MATT: (worried) "Uh--"

500
00:23:00.967 --> 00:23:03.826
"Yes, uh, everything's fine.

501
00:23:09.749 --> 00:23:12.682
"I-I don't know if you're responsible--"

502
00:23:12.682 --> 00:23:13.898
MARISHA: No, no.

503
00:23:15.039 --> 00:23:20.039
MATT: "--but thank you for helping
with the competition.

504
00:23:24.399 --> 00:23:25.232
"Just...

505
00:23:27.058 --> 00:23:29.225
"Let us know what you need."

506
00:23:30.496 --> 00:23:32.847
SAM: You've become their god.

507
00:23:32.847 --> 00:23:36.579
TRAVIS: You're taking credit for
something somebody else did?

508
00:23:36.579 --> 00:23:38.687
TALIESIN: Baller.
IAM: She's a warlock picture.

509
00:23:38.687 --> 00:23:41.274
MARISHA: He's a completely superstitious man.

510
00:23:41.274 --> 00:23:43.666
MATT: Remember there was that
competitive wine family

511
00:23:43.666 --> 00:23:46.621
that got attacked by Obann.

512
00:23:46.621 --> 00:23:47.979
MARISHA: I remember.

513
00:23:50.106 --> 00:23:52.543
ASHLEY: Competitive wine family?

514
00:23:52.543 --> 00:23:54.620
They just drink wine?
SAM: No, no.

515
00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:56.229
TALIESIN: No, no, wow, that's fair.

516
00:23:56.229 --> 00:23:59.281
SAM: They sell wine and make wine.

517
00:23:59.281 --> 00:24:00.922
LIAM: Business rival.
SAM: Business rival.

518
00:24:00.922 --> 00:24:03.597
MATT: Business rivals of her family.
LAURA: Last message of the day

519
00:24:03.597 --> 00:24:05.863
that I'm going to send today.

520
00:24:06.995 --> 00:24:10.784
I'm going to send a message to the Inevitable End.

521
00:24:10.784 --> 00:24:13.114
SAM: What?
TALIESIN: Oh!

522
00:24:13.114 --> 00:24:14.531
LAURA: And just say...

523
00:24:15.456 --> 00:24:18.043
Hey, so you kind of disappeared,

524
00:24:18.043 --> 00:24:21.085
but I just want to say thank you so much

525
00:24:21.085 --> 00:24:23.335
for helping out back there.

526
00:24:24.466 --> 00:24:27.164
If you want a friend, because it's probably--

527
00:24:29.047 --> 00:24:34.047
Send another one: pretty lonely there,

528
00:24:34.298 --> 00:24:35.906
with whatever you're doing.

529
00:24:35.906 --> 00:24:39.805
If you want a friend, you know, just let us know.

530
00:24:39.805 --> 00:24:41.138
Thank you again.

531
00:24:42.878 --> 00:24:43.711
Also!

532
00:24:45.408 --> 00:24:47.558
Like your hair.

533
00:24:47.558 --> 00:24:51.147
(laughter)

534
00:24:55.207 --> 00:24:56.507
MATT: A response comes back.

535
00:24:56.507 --> 00:24:58.323
"(laughing)

536
00:25:00.206 --> 00:25:02.456
"I think I know who this is.

537
00:25:04.304 --> 00:25:07.396
"I appreciate your aid

538
00:25:08.606 --> 00:25:11.073
"in breaking his will.

539
00:25:13.755 --> 00:25:16.314
"And I show appreciation

540
00:25:17.944 --> 00:25:20.673
"by letting you live."

541
00:25:20.673 --> 00:25:21.673
LAURA: It's okay.

542
00:25:23.892 --> 00:25:25.663
MATT: "We will not meet again."

543
00:25:25.663 --> 00:25:27.813
LAURA: Oh, come on!

544
00:25:30.133 --> 00:25:32.352
MATT: And that's it.
TALIESIN: Didn't even comment on the hair.

545
00:25:32.352 --> 00:25:34.210
LAURA: Does she know that she can respond twice?

546
00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:36.669
I sent two messages.

547
00:25:38.134 --> 00:25:41.509
I'm just going to doodle in
my journal, The Inevitable End,

548
00:25:42.884 --> 00:25:44.532
fading out of a wall.

549
00:25:44.532 --> 00:25:45.914
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: Okay.

550
00:25:45.914 --> 00:25:46.892
MATT: It's pretty well done.

551
00:25:46.892 --> 00:25:48.771
There's some good shading, some good crosshatching on it.

552
00:25:48.771 --> 00:25:52.621
You're getting better and better at this at the weeks go on.

553
00:25:53.862 --> 00:25:56.254
LAURA: I'm also going to draw what I imagine Beau's dad

554
00:25:56.254 --> 00:25:59.321
looks like melting into a puddle.

555
00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:02.494
SAM: Does it look like Beau with a mustache?

556
00:26:02.494 --> 00:26:05.553
LAURA: Kind of, yeah.
(laughter)

557
00:26:05.553 --> 00:26:07.892
MATT: All righty, anybody else?

558
00:26:07.892 --> 00:26:11.844
LIAM: Yeah, before the days gets too late,

559
00:26:11.844 --> 00:26:14.591
I ask Fjord and Nott if you would accompany me

560
00:26:14.591 --> 00:26:16.673
on a quick errand.

561
00:26:16.673 --> 00:26:18.557
SAM: Of course, yes.
LIAM: Let's take a walk.

562
00:26:19.719 --> 00:26:22.022
And I will lead them through Rexxentrum

563
00:26:22.022 --> 00:26:26.233
and go and cruise past the Soltryce Academy.

564
00:26:26.233 --> 00:26:27.299
MATT: Okay.

565
00:26:35.463 --> 00:26:39.075
LIAM: I don't want to go in or anything, but,

566
00:26:39.075 --> 00:26:43.208
(chuckles) I thought both of you would appreciate it...

567
00:26:44.384 --> 00:26:47.601
seeing it for different reasons.

568
00:26:50.406 --> 00:26:53.536
TRAVIS: It's much different than I expected, I admit.

569
00:26:53.536 --> 00:26:56.882
I actually looked forward to coming here at one point.

570
00:26:56.882 --> 00:26:59.198
(chuckles) Learning.

571
00:27:01.854 --> 00:27:03.723
LIAM: It's technically possible.

572
00:27:03.723 --> 00:27:06.765
MATT: You hear a heavy door open and you watch as a group

573
00:27:06.765 --> 00:27:09.934
of 12 students, all in very neat uniforms,

574
00:27:09.934 --> 00:27:12.086
emerging off in the distance

575
00:27:12.086 --> 00:27:15.473
as their teacher is giving a soft lecture to them

576
00:27:15.473 --> 00:27:17.961
as they head through one of the exterior gardens.

577
00:27:17.961 --> 00:27:21.336
And it's a beautiful campus.

578
00:27:21.336 --> 00:27:22.791
It's massive.

579
00:27:25.108 --> 00:27:28.274
The Tri-Spires in Zadash and the Hall of Erudition there

580
00:27:28.274 --> 00:27:30.596
did not prepare you for the scope

581
00:27:30.596 --> 00:27:35.280
and splendor of this particular location.

582
00:27:38.378 --> 00:27:40.788
With the context of you learning about some of the people

583
00:27:40.788 --> 00:27:43.276
who have been involved with it, it might have darkened it

584
00:27:43.276 --> 00:27:46.183
a bit, but objectively it's

585
00:27:46.183 --> 00:27:50.134
a very well-crafted and very well-kept

586
00:27:50.134 --> 00:27:52.243
campus of towers and walkways

587
00:27:52.243 --> 00:27:55.105
and large marble halls and tall windows

588
00:27:55.105 --> 00:27:58.234
and you in particular watching this class pass by,

589
00:27:58.234 --> 00:28:00.490
your words escape you in a moment as you are immediately

590
00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:04.960
brought back to those early days, so hopeful,

591
00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:07.019
absorbing all knowledge that you could possibly

592
00:28:07.019 --> 00:28:08.731
get your hands on.

593
00:28:08.731 --> 00:28:12.851
TRAVIS: They look happy, these students.

594
00:28:12.851 --> 00:28:14.151
LIAM: Believe me...

595
00:28:15.767 --> 00:28:19.434
Being a young man here and attending school,

596
00:28:21.455 --> 00:28:23.288
was like nothing else.

597
00:28:25.895 --> 00:28:27.812
It felt very important.

598
00:28:29.865 --> 00:28:30.782
It was a...

599
00:28:31.914 --> 00:28:33.348
A great honor.

600
00:28:35.674 --> 00:28:40.545
SAM: Were <i>any</i> of your professors
just sweet, kind-hearted souls

601
00:28:40.545 --> 00:28:44.447
or were they all sort of ulterior motive-y?

602
00:28:44.447 --> 00:28:45.280
LIAM: No.

603
00:28:47.842 --> 00:28:51.259
It was a wonderful place to go to school.

604
00:28:52.094 --> 00:28:53.677
With good teachers.

605
00:28:54.982 --> 00:28:58.385
And just bright people, it was exciting.

606
00:28:58.385 --> 00:29:01.302
Where everyone around you was so...

607
00:29:03.886 --> 00:29:07.794
Their minds just sparking and I-- I...

608
00:29:09.686 --> 00:29:12.031
I was not going to be a soldier like my father

609
00:29:12.031 --> 00:29:15.323
and I felt like I belonged, finally.

610
00:29:19.281 --> 00:29:22.354
TRAVIS: Do you ever wonder what
would have happened if you had

611
00:29:22.354 --> 00:29:25.546
stayed there, and if those...

612
00:29:25.546 --> 00:29:29.114
bad actors hadn't gotten their hands on you in that way,

613
00:29:29.114 --> 00:29:33.030
do you imagine where you might be?

614
00:29:35.034 --> 00:29:37.026
LIAM: Oh, um...

615
00:29:39.765 --> 00:29:42.506
Probably a teacher here.

616
00:29:42.506 --> 00:29:46.115
At least, that's what I thought when I started.

617
00:29:46.115 --> 00:29:49.275
It was intoxicating. I never wanted to leave.

618
00:29:50.658 --> 00:29:52.241
I wanted to just...

619
00:29:54.376 --> 00:29:57.626
Go through the revolving door and stay.

620
00:29:58.698 --> 00:30:01.016
SAM: I think you'd probably be an excellent teacher.

621
00:30:01.016 --> 00:30:04.479
You've taught me quite a bit already

622
00:30:04.479 --> 00:30:09.027
without any formal, you know, classrooms or anything.

623
00:30:09.027 --> 00:30:13.115
LIAM: Well, you are very bright,
like the people in there.

624
00:30:13.115 --> 00:30:14.783
SAM: But, I mean, think about that.

625
00:30:14.783 --> 00:30:18.616
You'd be surrounded by knowledge and books and...

626
00:30:19.491 --> 00:30:23.574
eager students. That would be a pretty cool life.

627
00:30:26.451 --> 00:30:27.792
LIAM: I think you're right.

628
00:30:27.792 --> 00:30:29.875
SAM: Maybe one day you could...

629
00:30:31.643 --> 00:30:32.859
do that.

630
00:30:34.201 --> 00:30:38.059
Maybe not here, but there could be a place.

631
00:30:40.631 --> 00:30:45.631
LIAM: Well, maybe I focus on you, for the time being.

632
00:30:45.663 --> 00:30:49.580
You're such a good student, you need to thrive.

633
00:30:51.871 --> 00:30:53.788
SAM: I wouldn't mind that.

634
00:30:54.782 --> 00:30:56.865
Do you want to go inside?

635
00:30:59.553 --> 00:31:02.415
We could disguise ourselves and walk around,

636
00:31:02.415 --> 00:31:04.332
pretend to be students.

637
00:31:05.196 --> 00:31:09.047
Ask where the chow hall is, or whatever they call it.

638
00:31:09.047 --> 00:31:11.202
I don't know, is that what they call it at schools?

639
00:31:11.202 --> 00:31:14.202
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, mess hall.
SAM: Mess hall?

640
00:31:16.712 --> 00:31:18.441
LIAM: I don't think so.

641
00:31:18.441 --> 00:31:21.184
You know what I would like to do
is go back to the cottage

642
00:31:21.184 --> 00:31:24.292
and start sorting through

643
00:31:25.874 --> 00:31:27.957
those papers we took from

644
00:31:29.733 --> 00:31:31.605
the Archmage's Bane.

645
00:31:31.605 --> 00:31:34.419
See if I can't start to figure that out.

646
00:31:34.419 --> 00:31:37.086
SAM: Yes, that would be tremendous.

647
00:31:38.322 --> 00:31:42.019
Are you sure you didn't want to check on anyone else

648
00:31:42.019 --> 00:31:45.753
while you're here in Rexxentrum?

649
00:31:47.381 --> 00:31:50.152
LIAM: I think it is a bad idea
to stick my neck out here,

650
00:31:50.152 --> 00:31:51.690
any more than I have.

651
00:31:51.690 --> 00:31:53.523
SAM: Or send us to check?

652
00:31:56.099 --> 00:31:58.099
LIAM: Let's just lay low and...

653
00:32:00.537 --> 00:32:02.645
get out of here.

654
00:32:02.645 --> 00:32:03.478
It's--

655
00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:07.456
I'm not welcome here.

656
00:32:07.456 --> 00:32:08.787
SAM: Okay.

657
00:32:08.787 --> 00:32:10.627
TRAVIS: And to be clear, you think this place

658
00:32:10.627 --> 00:32:12.524
is still capable of good, yes?

659
00:32:12.524 --> 00:32:17.524
It can make positive change,
affect lives in a good way,

660
00:32:17.766 --> 00:32:21.491
not just take people down dark paths and...

661
00:32:25.526 --> 00:32:27.076
LIAM: Probab-- probably.

662
00:32:29.358 --> 00:32:31.363
TRAVIS: Your grievances are personal, then?

663
00:32:31.363 --> 00:32:33.696
Not with this establishment?

664
00:32:34.763 --> 00:32:36.414
(Caleb sighs)

665
00:32:36.414 --> 00:32:40.581
LIAM: It's a fairly tangled knot,
Fjord, I'm not sure.

666
00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:44.343
TRAVIS: All right.

667
00:32:46.291 --> 00:32:48.833
LIAM: Thank you for coming with me.

668
00:32:48.833 --> 00:32:50.866
TRAVIS: Thank you for showing us.

669
00:32:52.723 --> 00:32:54.640
LIAM: You're a good friend.

670
00:32:55.811 --> 00:32:57.644
TRAVIS: As are you, and you.

671
00:32:59.690 --> 00:33:01.006
SAM: Oh, who, me?

672
00:33:02.011 --> 00:33:03.465
TRAVIS: Maybe not you.

673
00:33:03.465 --> 00:33:06.031
(laughter)

674
00:33:06.031 --> 00:33:07.346
LIAM: I don't want to wear out my welcome.

675
00:33:07.346 --> 00:33:09.554
SAM: Yeah, let's go.

676
00:33:09.554 --> 00:33:10.387
MATT: Okay.

677
00:33:11.442 --> 00:33:13.771
LIAM: And for the time being, I will head back,

678
00:33:13.771 --> 00:33:17.121
and I will spend, as much as my mind can focus on it here,

679
00:33:17.121 --> 00:33:20.256
time on those incomplete writings.

680
00:33:20.256 --> 00:33:22.024
MATT: From Halas?
LIAM: From Halas.

681
00:33:22.024 --> 00:33:23.012
MATT: Make an arcana check for me.

682
00:33:23.012 --> 00:33:24.429
SAM: Yes!
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

683
00:33:26.534 --> 00:33:28.994
LIAM: (screeches) 16.

684
00:33:28.994 --> 00:33:30.155
MATT: 16?

685
00:33:30.155 --> 00:33:31.892
LIAM: I have plus 10, but I always roll low.

686
00:33:31.892 --> 00:33:34.108
MATT: Not a bad start, not a bad start, as you're poring

687
00:33:34.108 --> 00:33:36.501
through the notes, you pull out your own blank sheets

688
00:33:36.501 --> 00:33:39.767
and in a very Beautiful Mind kind of way

689
00:33:39.767 --> 00:33:41.388
begin to connect the dots,

690
00:33:41.388 --> 00:33:45.546
begin to improvise on the incomplete glyphs

691
00:33:46.453 --> 00:33:49.468
and following the threads and making sketches and then

692
00:33:49.468 --> 00:33:52.765
finding problems in your work and then scrapping it.

693
00:33:52.765 --> 00:33:56.085
You begin to see the early patterns

694
00:33:56.085 --> 00:33:58.978
of what this may have been able capable of

695
00:33:58.978 --> 00:34:01.566
and what ways you might be able to bend it in the direction

696
00:34:01.566 --> 00:34:04.316
of some of the things you want to accomplish.

697
00:34:04.316 --> 00:34:07.178
You do know at this stage, in really digging into it,

698
00:34:07.178 --> 00:34:10.210
it's not going to be a quick road.

699
00:34:10.210 --> 00:34:13.645
Who knows how long it might take, but,

700
00:34:13.645 --> 00:34:18.256
much like any new project that gives you a hint

701
00:34:18.256 --> 00:34:22.773
of a very strong goal, that little peek of obsession

702
00:34:22.773 --> 00:34:26.057
begins to percolate in the back of your mind

703
00:34:26.057 --> 00:34:28.317
and you begin to consider

704
00:34:28.317 --> 00:34:32.517
how much of your waking time you can spend

705
00:34:32.517 --> 00:34:34.546
to solve this problem.

706
00:34:34.546 --> 00:34:37.969
Because you're fairly confident from what you've seen here,

707
00:34:37.969 --> 00:34:41.469
you could probably do it with enough time.

708
00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:45.129
LIAM: After a couple hours of that, I will hang out

709
00:34:45.129 --> 00:34:47.859
in the common room and pretend to read a book

710
00:34:47.859 --> 00:34:51.892
and watch for my colleagues

711
00:34:51.892 --> 00:34:55.275
and wait for them all to leave.

712
00:34:55.275 --> 00:34:56.108
MATT: Okay.

713
00:34:57.955 --> 00:34:59.119
Anybody over here?

714
00:34:59.119 --> 00:35:01.898
TRAVIS: I will spend the mornings and the evenings

715
00:35:01.898 --> 00:35:06.357
trying to meditate more on the Wildmother.

716
00:35:06.357 --> 00:35:08.637
Trying to practice putting myself,

717
00:35:08.637 --> 00:35:12.426
feeling what she needs or wants to show me.

718
00:35:12.426 --> 00:35:15.159
Just sort of making myself open to whatever that might be

719
00:35:15.159 --> 00:35:17.586
and proudly displaying in a place of prominence,

720
00:35:17.586 --> 00:35:22.119
the little pin that Caduceus gave me.

721
00:35:23.146 --> 00:35:26.058
MATT: Whereabouts are you meditating?

722
00:35:26.058 --> 00:35:29.398
TRAVIS: I suppose just a room, it could just be a room

723
00:35:29.398 --> 00:35:31.518
that no one else is in, just trying to find a quiet space.

724
00:35:31.518 --> 00:35:33.884
MATT: Okay, good.
LAURA: You should do it outdoors.

725
00:35:33.884 --> 00:35:35.516
TRAVIS: Outdoors.

726
00:35:35.516 --> 00:35:39.378
I would find a garden, also.

727
00:35:39.378 --> 00:35:42.298
(Taliesin screams)
(laughter)

728
00:35:42.298 --> 00:35:46.323
Indoor, back indoors.
(laughter)

729
00:35:46.323 --> 00:35:47.370
Start small.

730
00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:51.506
MATT: All right, As you quickly turn around--

731
00:35:51.506 --> 00:35:54.290
LIAM: Pluck a single flower and go right back inside.

732
00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:58.050
MATT: You head back to your personal chambers.

733
00:35:58.050 --> 00:36:00.360
Make sure the balcony is available, so some of the

734
00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:02.139
colder breeze can come in, it's still overcast.

735
00:36:02.139 --> 00:36:03.826
It isn't in a bright day.

736
00:36:03.826 --> 00:36:05.406
The rain's been off and on since you've been here

737
00:36:05.406 --> 00:36:06.573
in Rexxentrum.

738
00:36:07.554 --> 00:36:10.936
There is a cleansing chill that comes with the wind

739
00:36:10.936 --> 00:36:14.227
that is still welcoming and makes you feel more at ease

740
00:36:14.227 --> 00:36:16.396
and connected to the nature beyond

741
00:36:16.396 --> 00:36:18.563
this massive city's walls.

742
00:36:19.847 --> 00:36:23.367
In focusing and closing your eyes and

743
00:36:23.367 --> 00:36:26.000
remembering what it felt like in those few moments

744
00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.735
that you were communing with the Wildmother

745
00:36:28.735 --> 00:36:33.622
in those visions you had when she tore you from the

746
00:36:33.622 --> 00:36:36.784
caustic grasp of Uk'otoa--

747
00:36:36.784 --> 00:36:37.971
SAM and MARISHA: (whispering) Uk'otoa.

748
00:36:37.971 --> 00:36:40.071
MATT: -- and had

749
00:36:40.071 --> 00:36:44.012
taken your sins as her own.

750
00:36:45.001 --> 00:36:48.360
And it takes some time, but eventually

751
00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:50.685
the chill begins to pass,

752
00:36:50.685 --> 00:36:53.561
and a familiar warm breeze from

753
00:36:53.561 --> 00:36:57.338
those moments comes into your mind and you feel at peace.

754
00:36:57.338 --> 00:37:00.832
Time begins to crawl.

755
00:37:00.832 --> 00:37:02.915
Focus comes to your mind.

756
00:37:04.154 --> 00:37:06.321
And you can hear the waves

757
00:37:07.521 --> 00:37:11.354
crash against the shore from when you grew up.

758
00:37:12.473 --> 00:37:14.153
And you find that peaceful place you haven't

759
00:37:14.153 --> 00:37:18.269
found in a while and just stay there.

760
00:37:19.151 --> 00:37:21.283
TRAVIS: That's very cool.

761
00:37:21.283 --> 00:37:23.283
I do love the ocean.

762
00:37:23.283 --> 00:37:24.899
And in between that time, I will find Beau,

763
00:37:24.899 --> 00:37:27.918
and try to work out with her whenever possible.

764
00:37:27.918 --> 00:37:29.457
MATT: Okay.

765
00:37:29.457 --> 00:37:32.038
Between meditation, pumping some iron.

766
00:37:32.038 --> 00:37:34.854
MARISHA: Fighting pit, fighting pit, that'll be happening,

767
00:37:34.854 --> 00:37:36.604
We'll get to that.

768
00:37:36.604 --> 00:37:38.521
Beau spends her days...

769
00:37:40.284 --> 00:37:42.627
Working out, early morning workout with Fjord.

770
00:37:42.627 --> 00:37:43.851
SAM: Sure.
TRAVIS: Yep.

771
00:37:43.851 --> 00:37:45.337
MATT: High-intensity training.
MARISHA: 6:00am.

772
00:37:45.337 --> 00:37:48.375
Totally, 6:00am. Absolutely.
TRAVIS: I had too much breakfast.

773
00:37:48.375 --> 00:37:50.363
Too much breakfast and some orange juice on the first one.

774
00:37:50.363 --> 00:37:51.645
All of it came up.

775
00:37:51.645 --> 00:37:53.391
I didn't do that again the second time.

776
00:37:53.391 --> 00:37:56.003
MARISHA: You only have to do that a couple times, you know,

777
00:37:56.003 --> 00:37:57.763
before you don't do that.

778
00:37:57.763 --> 00:38:00.565
You tend to just eat afterwards

779
00:38:00.565 --> 00:38:05.467
and I spend my days at the library.

780
00:38:05.467 --> 00:38:07.403
MATT: Okay, to the Rexxentrum Archive.

781
00:38:07.403 --> 00:38:11.952
MARISHA: The Rexxentrum Archive, and I have a list of things

782
00:38:11.952 --> 00:38:13.312
that I would like to research,

783
00:38:13.312 --> 00:38:15.550
but I don't want to Caleb this, either.

784
00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:18.330
(laughter)

785
00:38:18.330 --> 00:38:20.186
SAM: Back-handed compliment.

786
00:38:20.186 --> 00:38:22.143
MATT: You can, if you'd like.

787
00:38:22.143 --> 00:38:25.697
What things would you like to research while there?

788
00:38:25.697 --> 00:38:27.728
MARISHA: Pride's Call, and if they have any current records

789
00:38:27.728 --> 00:38:29.839
of their archeological digs.

790
00:38:29.839 --> 00:38:31.289
MATT: Okay, starting with that.

791
00:38:31.289 --> 00:38:35.289
Go ahead and make an investigation check for me.

792
00:38:36.975 --> 00:38:39.981
Which, with your new level--
MARISHA: Is a 12.

793
00:38:39.981 --> 00:38:44.472
MATT: I think you took your
Mystical Erudition in investigation.

794
00:38:44.472 --> 00:38:48.563
MARISHA: I rolled a natural 19, so that's 31.

795
00:38:48.563 --> 00:38:50.390
LIAM: Skidoosh.

796
00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:52.690
MARISHA: (excited laugh)

797
00:38:52.690 --> 00:38:54.748
I did a good one!

798
00:38:54.748 --> 00:38:59.066
I did a good investigation roll.
MATT: Yeah, you did.

799
00:38:59.066 --> 00:39:01.468
Yes, Pride's Call, you learn a lot of things.

800
00:39:01.468 --> 00:39:05.929
Pride's Call was one of the initial dwarven societies

801
00:39:05.929 --> 00:39:08.247
that joined the Dwendalian Empire as it began

802
00:39:08.247 --> 00:39:10.580
to expand out of Rexxentrum.

803
00:39:12.125 --> 00:39:14.538
It was not conquered by any means.

804
00:39:14.538 --> 00:39:19.006
It was an agreement of mutual interest

805
00:39:19.006 --> 00:39:23.088
and it wasn't until Grimgolir, the mountain-based

806
00:39:23.088 --> 00:39:26.504
dwarven society on the far Eastern side

807
00:39:26.504 --> 00:39:29.888
of the Marrow Valley

808
00:39:29.888 --> 00:39:32.092
was brought in, that a jealousy between the societies

809
00:39:32.092 --> 00:39:34.542
began to come in. As Grimgolir
took over military activities,

810
00:39:34.542 --> 00:39:36.139
Pride's Call began to fall out of favor a bit

811
00:39:36.139 --> 00:39:40.638
as far as the poster child for a lot of their military might

812
00:39:40.638 --> 00:39:43.781
and so since then, a lot of their focus has now gone towards

813
00:39:43.781 --> 00:39:47.723
their strange and unique

814
00:39:47.723 --> 00:39:51.591
landscape due to the geothermal activity

815
00:39:51.591 --> 00:39:55.872
that transpires in the surrounding mountains.

816
00:39:55.872 --> 00:39:59.763
You discover that there is indeed an excavation,

817
00:39:59.763 --> 00:40:03.432
a little bit to the east of Pride's Call.

818
00:40:03.432 --> 00:40:08.432
It began with a sinkhole that had fallen in years ago.

819
00:40:08.752 --> 00:40:11.760
A portion of the ground that just suddenly caved in

820
00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:14.391
and as investigations began to go into it,

821
00:40:14.391 --> 00:40:16.885
it was discovered that beneath that cave-in,

822
00:40:16.885 --> 00:40:18.926
there was ruins.

823
00:40:19.875 --> 00:40:23.538
The excavation immediately was taken

824
00:40:23.538 --> 00:40:27.570
and brought into the jurisdiction of the Cerberus Assembly.

825
00:40:27.570 --> 00:40:32.345
But as part of that battle for it,

826
00:40:34.605 --> 00:40:39.605
Yudala Fon, the High Curator of the library you're in,

827
00:40:39.927 --> 00:40:43.335
also sought for some control and they managed to

828
00:40:43.335 --> 00:40:46.285
arrange with the king a joint custody

829
00:40:46.285 --> 00:40:49.205
over the excavation,

830
00:40:49.205 --> 00:40:51.437
though with the Cerberus Assembly having the final say.

831
00:40:51.437 --> 00:40:55.800
So they're both in this counter-balancing overlook of it.

832
00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.943
MARISHA: It's a 49/51 split?
MATT: Kind of, yeah.

833
00:40:57.943 --> 00:41:00.860
MARISHA: Okay.
MATT: You also, you rolled high.

834
00:41:02.301 --> 00:41:05.792
It is believed since then that the ruins

835
00:41:05.792 --> 00:41:09.363
are from an Arcanum city called Shattengrad.

836
00:41:09.363 --> 00:41:11.248
MARISHA: We've heard of that.

837
00:41:11.248 --> 00:41:13.349
MATT: You may or may not have.
TRAVIS: I don't think so.

838
00:41:13.349 --> 00:41:16.059
MATT: I don't believe you have. Shattengrad was one

839
00:41:16.059 --> 00:41:19.379
of a number of prominent cities in the Age of Arcanum.

840
00:41:19.379 --> 00:41:20.952
This was not one of the famed floating cities.

841
00:41:20.952 --> 00:41:25.241
Only a handful of them were elevated through brumestone.

842
00:41:25.241 --> 00:41:28.896
This one probably existed here before it was destroyed

843
00:41:28.896 --> 00:41:31.587
before or during the Calamity.

844
00:41:31.587 --> 00:41:34.212
But has since become a...

845
00:41:35.304 --> 00:41:37.314
A very intense point of focus

846
00:41:37.314 --> 00:41:40.643
for possibly unearthing any sort of arcane weaponry,

847
00:41:40.643 --> 00:41:42.814
any sort of technology that was being used at the time,

848
00:41:42.814 --> 00:41:45.366
anything used to give the Empire a leg up

849
00:41:45.366 --> 00:41:48.558
as both a leader in trade, a leader in technology,

850
00:41:48.558 --> 00:41:52.833
and now with the conflict with the Kryn Dynasty,

851
00:41:52.833 --> 00:41:56.555
a means of defending and/or essentially becoming

852
00:41:56.555 --> 00:42:00.825
a much easier victor for the conflict.

853
00:42:00.825 --> 00:42:01.658
MARISHA: Interesting.

854
00:42:01.658 --> 00:42:03.827
MATT: You also do learn in your research, less about looking

855
00:42:03.827 --> 00:42:05.724
through the books and more about asking questions around the

856
00:42:05.724 --> 00:42:10.709
library in which Yudala Fon is present now because they have

857
00:42:10.709 --> 00:42:14.545
returned from the council where you saw them previously.

858
00:42:14.545 --> 00:42:19.545
And probably speaking a bit with Yudala, you'd uncover that

859
00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:22.737
there was indeed an object recovered from the ruins

860
00:42:22.737 --> 00:42:27.737
a few weeks back described by some of the actual Cobalt Soul

861
00:42:27.966 --> 00:42:30.569
at the scene as a geometric shape

862
00:42:30.569 --> 00:42:33.652
pulsing with some strange dull power.

863
00:42:34.569 --> 00:42:37.117
Yudala had already, and it's not like the beacon

864
00:42:37.117 --> 00:42:40.798
is not unknown in these prominent circles.

865
00:42:40.798 --> 00:42:43.425
The beacons of the Kryn Dynasty aren't some guarded secret.

866
00:42:43.425 --> 00:42:45.346
It's part of their central religion, so for those that

867
00:42:45.346 --> 00:42:49.028
actually look into it and research, or in places of

868
00:42:49.028 --> 00:42:52.625
prominent cultural information sharing,

869
00:42:52.625 --> 00:42:55.643
the beacons are known, so this object is definitely

870
00:42:55.643 --> 00:42:58.684
confirmed as a beacon of the Dynasty.

871
00:42:58.684 --> 00:43:01.601
Unfortunately, it was discovered by

872
00:43:05.849 --> 00:43:07.873
hired teams by the Assembly,

873
00:43:07.873 --> 00:43:10.553
and before it could be properly discussed,

874
00:43:10.553 --> 00:43:13.323
it was already claimed by the Assembly

875
00:43:13.323 --> 00:43:17.474
and as such, has not been seen since, but that does--

876
00:43:17.474 --> 00:43:19.890
MARISHA: Are you sure it didn't have-- go ahead.

877
00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:21.603
MATT: It seemed to line up and confirm with some of the

878
00:43:21.603 --> 00:43:25.712
things that Ikithon has spoken about at the council.

879
00:43:25.712 --> 00:43:29.712
MARISHA: Does it have any confirmed dates?

880
00:43:29.712 --> 00:43:32.130
Any dates of the uncovering?

881
00:43:32.130 --> 00:43:35.345
MATT: It would have been three weeks.

882
00:43:35.345 --> 00:43:37.512
MARISHA: Three weeks ago?
MATT: Three weeks ago.

883
00:43:39.737 --> 00:43:40.953
MARISHA: Oh.

884
00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:43.700
Okay.

885
00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:45.686
SAM: Wait, that tracks with--

886
00:43:45.686 --> 00:43:47.328
LAURA: That does track with what he was saying.

887
00:43:47.328 --> 00:43:48.618
SAM: They weren't lying?

888
00:43:48.618 --> 00:43:52.443
MARISHA: But it means that there's
another beacon still missing.

889
00:43:52.443 --> 00:43:55.677
MATT: It means that there is a third beacon

890
00:43:55.677 --> 00:43:59.317
that the Empire is aware of.

891
00:43:59.317 --> 00:44:02.269
TRAVIS: Yeah, you took the first.

892
00:44:02.269 --> 00:44:05.715
MARISHA: They stole the first, and the second.

893
00:44:05.715 --> 00:44:08.507
MATT: There were two that were stolen originally, it seemed,

894
00:44:08.507 --> 00:44:09.763
that were being held by the Assembly.

895
00:44:09.763 --> 00:44:13.681
One that you returned, one that is still at large.

896
00:44:13.681 --> 00:44:15.860
And the one that was found in this ruin.

897
00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:16.817
LIAM: So there's just one floating,

898
00:44:16.817 --> 00:44:18.019
and we have no information on it.

899
00:44:18.019 --> 00:44:21.416
SAM: The one that they showed us was time-accurate, right?

900
00:44:21.416 --> 00:44:24.613
They said they found it a couple of weeks ago.

901
00:44:24.613 --> 00:44:27.095
LIAM: They were still totally shady and lying to us about--

902
00:44:27.095 --> 00:44:28.113
LAURA: The fact that they already had another one.

903
00:44:28.113 --> 00:44:30.742
LIAM: This was the first time they'd ever come across one.

904
00:44:30.742 --> 00:44:34.640
TRAVIS: You couldn't scry on a beacon, could you?

905
00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:36.154
SAM: Well, she used all her spells for the day.

906
00:44:36.154 --> 00:44:39.237
LAURA: Well, we're here for a couple days.

907
00:44:40.419 --> 00:44:44.200
TRAVIS: So something like a beacon, are they identical?

908
00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:46.377
Or could you only scry on the one that you would have seen?

909
00:44:46.377 --> 00:44:47.697
MARISHA: Yeah, that's true.

910
00:44:47.697 --> 00:44:50.008
LIAM: Oh, wait, well, we saw one,
we saw one at the Sanatorium.

911
00:44:50.008 --> 00:44:53.099
LAURA: It says that it's a creature that you choose.

912
00:44:53.099 --> 00:44:54.992
MATT: Instead of choosing a creature,
you can choose a location

913
00:44:54.992 --> 00:44:56.190
that you've seen before.

914
00:44:56.190 --> 00:44:58.278
SAM: But not a thing.
MATT: Technically an object.

915
00:44:58.278 --> 00:45:02.636
It's like Find Object is a spell for things similar to that.

916
00:45:02.636 --> 00:45:04.806
So like a location you could scry on,

917
00:45:04.806 --> 00:45:07.306
or a creature you can scry on.

918
00:45:09.372 --> 00:45:11.321
As we've learned and refined over the years

919
00:45:11.321 --> 00:45:13.387
what the boundaries of scrying entails.

920
00:45:13.387 --> 00:45:14.728
TRAVIS: We got to figure out who knows where that

921
00:45:14.728 --> 00:45:15.619
third one is.
MARISHA: Shit.

922
00:45:15.619 --> 00:45:16.719
TRAVIS: Somebody knows.

923
00:45:16.719 --> 00:45:20.379
And we've talked about somebody else.

924
00:45:20.379 --> 00:45:25.379
MARISHA: And we've placed Trent and Ludinus both in Zadash

925
00:45:25.539 --> 00:45:28.505
when the Tri-Spire was busted.

926
00:45:28.505 --> 00:45:29.510
TRAVIS: Yep.

927
00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:34.510
MARISHA: We then saw Ludinus in Felderwin talking to Lady--

928
00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:37.168
MATT: You don't know of Ludinus in Zadash.

929
00:45:37.168 --> 00:45:39.953
Zadash was Trent and Oremid Hass.

930
00:45:39.953 --> 00:45:41.463
LIAM: Saw them flying around the tower.

931
00:45:41.463 --> 00:45:43.367
MATT: Correct.

932
00:45:43.367 --> 00:45:47.034
MARISHA: But then we saw Ludinus in Felderwin with--

933
00:45:47.034 --> 00:45:48.831
SAM and MARISHA: Vess DeRogna.

934
00:45:48.831 --> 00:45:50.248
LIAM: Walking together and talking.

935
00:45:50.248 --> 00:45:54.294
MARISHA: And Vess DeRogna was leading the investigation--

936
00:45:54.294 --> 00:45:56.009
LIAM: She's the antiquities artifact lady.

937
00:45:56.009 --> 00:45:58.358
MATT: Correct, and she's the one who had hired

938
00:45:58.358 --> 00:46:00.922
your husband and was performing

939
00:46:00.922 --> 00:46:04.612
the experiments to try and extract and create--

940
00:46:04.612 --> 00:46:06.654
LAURA: That's how we got the potion, that one potion.

941
00:46:06.654 --> 00:46:09.151
LIAM: Nott-- Veth's husband's a witness.

942
00:46:09.151 --> 00:46:11.249
MARISHA: And that's also where we got the tripod.

943
00:46:11.249 --> 00:46:15.676
LIAM: And he is in danger, for knowing what he knows.

944
00:46:15.676 --> 00:46:18.396
MARISHA: And that fucking chair.

945
00:46:18.396 --> 00:46:20.327
LIAM: Fucking mastermind chair.

946
00:46:20.327 --> 00:46:22.394
TRAVIS: Can we scry that chair, do we know where it is now?

947
00:46:22.394 --> 00:46:24.772
MARISHA: And then we heard--
MATT: You can scry the location.

948
00:46:24.772 --> 00:46:27.248
SAM: It has to be on the same plane of existence, though.

949
00:46:27.248 --> 00:46:28.796
(laughter)

950
00:46:28.796 --> 00:46:31.357
TRAVIS: What if it's a creature?

951
00:46:31.357 --> 00:46:35.575
MATT: You can certainly try. (laughs)

952
00:46:35.575 --> 00:46:37.784
SAM: It's returned to its--

953
00:46:37.784 --> 00:46:39.115
MATT: The chair dimension?
SAM: Yes.

954
00:46:39.115 --> 00:46:40.408
TRAVIS: What level is scry, what spell level?

955
00:46:40.408 --> 00:46:42.016
TALIESIN: The Ottoman Empire.

956
00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:46.453
LIAM: One of these days.
SAM: The Ottoman Empire, amazing.

957
00:46:46.453 --> 00:46:48.269
TALIESIN: Terrible. I feel bad.
SAM: No, you should not.

958
00:46:48.269 --> 00:46:49.739
LIAM: Some day, at the end of this campaign,

959
00:46:49.739 --> 00:46:51.286
we're going to enter a full banquet hall

960
00:46:51.286 --> 00:46:52.927
and all the chairs are going to be mimics

961
00:46:52.927 --> 00:46:55.344
and it'll be what we deserve.

962
00:46:57.607 --> 00:46:58.690
And the door.

963
00:47:00.279 --> 00:47:02.410
Anything else you want to research?

964
00:47:02.410 --> 00:47:04.616
MARISHA: So many things.

965
00:47:04.616 --> 00:47:06.147
MATT: It takes you like a good,

966
00:47:06.147 --> 00:47:07.504
because it's some pretty deep research

967
00:47:07.504 --> 00:47:09.955
and conversations around, so it takes a number of hours

968
00:47:09.955 --> 00:47:13.158
to get that out, but you still have time in the day to--

969
00:47:13.158 --> 00:47:15.158
MARISHA: Okay, I'll give you...

970
00:47:16.646 --> 00:47:19.416
Okay, is there anything that,

971
00:47:19.416 --> 00:47:20.718
I'll come back to this other one.

972
00:47:20.718 --> 00:47:23.510
Is there anything, since I'm kind of on the beacon train,

973
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:27.446
that mentions multiple beacons across time and history?

974
00:47:27.446 --> 00:47:30.179
Is there anything clocks how many fucking beacons

975
00:47:30.179 --> 00:47:31.488
are out there, total?

976
00:47:31.488 --> 00:47:34.730
MATT: Roll another investigation check.

977
00:47:34.730 --> 00:47:37.531
MATT: Actually, I'll say investigation or religion.

978
00:47:37.531 --> 00:47:38.791
Those are your two choices.

979
00:47:38.791 --> 00:47:41.014
MARISHA: Investigation.

980
00:47:41.014 --> 00:47:42.888
TALIESIN: I do have Commune.

981
00:47:42.888 --> 00:47:45.508
We need to talk a few things.
LAURA: Yeah, same.

982
00:47:45.508 --> 00:47:46.849
TALIESIN: I've got Commune up.

983
00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:50.459
MARISHA: (excited breathing)

984
00:47:50.459 --> 00:47:51.558
It's not the blue one,

985
00:47:51.558 --> 00:47:53.806
but it looks like the other blue one.

986
00:47:53.806 --> 00:47:55.174
14.

987
00:47:55.174 --> 00:47:56.007
MATT: 14.

988
00:47:58.753 --> 00:48:01.663
Most of the information that exists in this archive

989
00:48:01.663 --> 00:48:05.896
reinforces your existing knowledge of the Kryn Dynasty,

990
00:48:05.896 --> 00:48:08.224
their worship the Luxon, and the beacons

991
00:48:08.224 --> 00:48:12.315
symbolizing parts of the Luxon when it initially dispersed

992
00:48:12.315 --> 00:48:15.747
itself throughout the world to help

993
00:48:15.747 --> 00:48:19.190
bring light and energy

994
00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:22.223
to a once cold ball of rock.

995
00:48:24.619 --> 00:48:28.070
The number of beacons is unknown from what you can tell.

996
00:48:28.070 --> 00:48:30.120
You have no information, nothing that seems to point

997
00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:32.680
to any sort of number or total.

998
00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:37.192
The only thing you do know is that they're searching.

999
00:48:37.192 --> 00:48:39.581
The Kryn Dynasty is always looking for more.

1000
00:48:39.581 --> 00:48:40.414
MARISHA: Okay.

1001
00:48:41.468 --> 00:48:43.801
MATT: As part of their religious

1002
00:48:46.051 --> 00:48:49.982
directive to find and gather the beacons.

1003
00:48:49.982 --> 00:48:51.782
MARISHA: Okay.
TRAVIS: When we saw that second beacon,

1004
00:48:51.782 --> 00:48:55.131
did it look like the first one almost identically, close?

1005
00:48:55.131 --> 00:48:56.381
MATT: Pretty close.

1006
00:48:57.710 --> 00:48:59.133
LIAM: Slightest differences, though?

1007
00:48:59.133 --> 00:49:01.142
MATT: Slight differences, like the shape could be

1008
00:49:01.142 --> 00:49:05.171
a little bit smaller or a little bit larger.

1009
00:49:05.171 --> 00:49:06.987
LAURA: The handles on it, are they the same?

1010
00:49:06.987 --> 00:49:08.240
MATT: The handles are different, because the handles

1011
00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:10.939
are constructed to be a holding device for it,

1012
00:49:10.939 --> 00:49:15.670
so depending on who is crafting it, those that were...

1013
00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:17.199
That you'd seen, that were taken from the Dynasty

1014
00:49:17.199 --> 00:49:20.171
all had a very similar filigreeing outer element to it.

1015
00:49:20.171 --> 00:49:24.359
The one that you saw that was being held by Trent

1016
00:49:24.359 --> 00:49:29.342
beneath the Sanatorium had similar

1017
00:49:30.542 --> 00:49:34.861
metallic wrappings to it, but they didn't have the same

1018
00:49:34.861 --> 00:49:38.667
Kryn design to it. It's more functional and basic.

1019
00:49:38.667 --> 00:49:39.941
LIAM: What about the fusty nut in the middle?

1020
00:49:39.941 --> 00:49:41.541
Are they slightly different sizes?

1021
00:49:41.541 --> 00:49:43.605
They have the same surface?

1022
00:49:43.605 --> 00:49:45.602
MATT: They're all still that

1023
00:49:45.602 --> 00:49:48.192
geometric dodecahedron shape.

1024
00:49:48.192 --> 00:49:50.721
Their sizes can vary, at least from the three

1025
00:49:50.721 --> 00:49:55.101
that you've encountered, or the two that you've encountered.

1026
00:49:55.101 --> 00:49:57.773
The one that you saw was a little bit smaller.

1027
00:49:57.773 --> 00:50:01.613
But comparable, like minor, minor difference.

1028
00:50:01.613 --> 00:50:05.168
MARISHA: I'll call it there for the day, I guess, because

1029
00:50:05.168 --> 00:50:06.794
I got to carb up for tonight.

1030
00:50:06.794 --> 00:50:08.345
(laughter)

1031
00:50:08.345 --> 00:50:10.673
TRAVIS: You actually carbo load a day before your event,

1032
00:50:10.673 --> 00:50:14.160
so you're just going to be slow and lethargic.

1033
00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:15.049
LAURA: As she gets back to the--

1034
00:50:15.049 --> 00:50:16.607
MATT: Well, she finds that out too late.

1035
00:50:16.607 --> 00:50:19.440
LAURA: As she gets back to the cottage,

1036
00:50:20.335 --> 00:50:23.539
I'm going to sit next to her.

1037
00:50:23.539 --> 00:50:24.770
MARISHA: What, huh?

1038
00:50:24.770 --> 00:50:27.230
LAURA: Are you avoiding me?

1039
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:28.063
MARISHA: No.

1040
00:50:28.063 --> 00:50:31.425
LAURA: Because we've been here
and I haven't hardly seen you at all

1041
00:50:31.425 --> 00:50:33.342
and I think I know why.

1042
00:50:34.317 --> 00:50:38.903
MARISHA: Uh, no, honestly, we've just been really busy.

1043
00:50:38.903 --> 00:50:41.685
We got here and then everything got like attacked

1044
00:50:41.685 --> 00:50:44.487
and then it was like, well, "We got to immediately, like,

1045
00:50:44.487 --> 00:50:46.058
"negotiate for King Dwendal."

1046
00:50:46.058 --> 00:50:48.869
LAURA: Right, but then you went
and you went to go do something

1047
00:50:48.869 --> 00:50:51.546
and I haven't seen you all day, I've just been sitting here.

1048
00:50:51.546 --> 00:50:53.966
MARISHA: Oh, I'm sorry, did you want an invite?

1049
00:50:53.966 --> 00:50:56.814
I was just reading books.
LAURA: No! Oh, no.

1050
00:50:56.814 --> 00:50:59.974
MARISHA: Yeah, I didn't think you'd be interested, exactly.

1051
00:50:59.974 --> 00:51:03.183
No, why do you think I'm avoiding you, though?

1052
00:51:03.183 --> 00:51:04.183
LAURA: Because...

1053
00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:09.247
Because I didn't save you.

1054
00:51:11.041 --> 00:51:15.980
MARISHA: (chuckles) No, no, that's not, no, not at all.

1055
00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:19.023
I was also, like, super kind of hazy and unconscious,

1056
00:51:19.023 --> 00:51:22.381
so you could have, I was unaware.

1057
00:51:23.746 --> 00:51:26.454
TRAVIS: Denial.
MARISHA: Yeah. (chuckles)

1058
00:51:26.454 --> 00:51:29.855
LAURA: I shouldn't have told you, then.

1059
00:51:29.855 --> 00:51:32.722
MARISHA: No, look, I trust your judgment.

1060
00:51:32.722 --> 00:51:34.882
LAURA: I wanted, no, I wanted to.

1061
00:51:34.882 --> 00:51:37.016
MARISHA: I was good, you know, Yasha had me.

1062
00:51:37.016 --> 00:51:39.894
She pulled me back, we're a team, you know?

1063
00:51:39.894 --> 00:51:41.236
LAURA: Okay.
MARISHA: We're good.

1064
00:51:41.236 --> 00:51:44.236
LAURA: All right.
MARISHA: I trust your judgment.

1065
00:51:45.384 --> 00:51:47.217
Caduceus is, you know,

1066
00:51:48.185 --> 00:51:50.406
also kind of a hot mess

1067
00:51:50.406 --> 00:51:51.977
who might need help sometimes.

1068
00:51:51.977 --> 00:51:55.234
LAURA: Well, he was swallowed, at the time.

1069
00:51:55.234 --> 00:51:57.230
MARISHA: See, I was unaware of that, too.

1070
00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:59.563
We haven't really actually conversed about any of this.

1071
00:51:59.563 --> 00:52:01.333
That sounds fucking insane.

1072
00:52:01.333 --> 00:52:05.932
LAURA: Yeah, and I was literally, I was next to the blob.

1073
00:52:05.932 --> 00:52:10.839
And from my perspective, like, I could hear Caduceus.

1074
00:52:10.839 --> 00:52:15.302
You know, I could hear him, he was like "Help, help me."

1075
00:52:15.302 --> 00:52:16.799
MARISHA: Jesus, that's--

1076
00:52:16.799 --> 00:52:19.298
LAURA: "Please, god, do something!"

1077
00:52:19.298 --> 00:52:21.378
It was terrible.

1078
00:52:21.378 --> 00:52:24.890
MARISHA: Yeah, like, I think you made the right call.

1079
00:52:24.890 --> 00:52:28.541
I was good, I was nowhere close to dying, clearly.

1080
00:52:28.541 --> 00:52:31.393
I was just a little unconscious.
LAURA: Beau, You were about to die, though.

1081
00:52:31.393 --> 00:52:32.691
Like, you were bleeding out,

1082
00:52:32.691 --> 00:52:34.334
you were bleeding out so hard,

1083
00:52:34.334 --> 00:52:37.213
like, I swear, maybe a couple more seconds

1084
00:52:37.213 --> 00:52:39.091
and you would've been gone for good.

1085
00:52:39.091 --> 00:52:42.620
LIAM: A strain of the death flute playing in the distance.

1086
00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:45.340
TALIESIN: Are you guys in the lobby of the hotel?

1087
00:52:45.340 --> 00:52:49.012
I'm just at a corner table just going...

1088
00:52:49.012 --> 00:52:53.768
(short bursts of flute screaming)
(laughter)

1089
00:52:53.768 --> 00:52:57.122
(short bursts of flute screaming)
(laughter)

1090
00:52:57.122 --> 00:53:00.668
MARISHA: He needs your help, too, clearly.
LAURA: That kind of what it sounded like from--

1091
00:53:00.668 --> 00:53:02.930
MARISHA: Oh, yeah, from inside the thing?

1092
00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:07.268
Yeah, no, you know, it's a team effort.

1093
00:53:07.268 --> 00:53:10.637
LAURA: I know, I know, it's--
MARISHA: You had Caduceus and Yasha had me

1094
00:53:10.637 --> 00:53:12.396
and then sometimes you'll have Fjord,

1095
00:53:12.396 --> 00:53:14.000
sometimes I'll have Fjord and sometimes Fjord sometimes--

1096
00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:15.917
LAURA: I know, I know, I know.

1097
00:53:15.917 --> 00:53:18.617
MARISHA: I always got you as long as I don't have to get

1098
00:53:18.617 --> 00:53:23.617
Caduceus first, you know, so no, we're cool.

1099
00:53:24.039 --> 00:53:25.531
LAURA: Okay.
MARISHA: Yeah.

1100
00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:28.927
LAURA: Well, I'm sorry anyway.

1101
00:53:28.927 --> 00:53:30.166
MARISHA: You don't have to--

1102
00:53:30.166 --> 00:53:33.204
LAURA: It's been bothering me.
MARISHA: Why?

1103
00:53:33.204 --> 00:53:34.695
LAURA: I don't know.

1104
00:53:34.695 --> 00:53:39.470
Because, you know, I don't want you to die.

1105
00:53:41.461 --> 00:53:42.461
MARISHA: Thank you.

1106
00:53:43.933 --> 00:53:46.100
I don't want to die, either.

1107
00:53:47.139 --> 00:53:51.148
LAURA: I cast a message and I sent a message to your dad!

1108
00:53:51.148 --> 00:53:53.386
(laughter)

1109
00:53:53.386 --> 00:53:55.557
MARISHA: (surprised laugh)

1110
00:53:55.557 --> 00:53:57.158
What?
LAURA: Is that okay?

1111
00:53:57.158 --> 00:53:58.148
MARISHA: Wait, what?

1112
00:53:58.148 --> 00:53:59.668
TALIESIN: (flute scream)

1113
00:53:59.668 --> 00:54:01.628
(laughter)

1114
00:54:01.628 --> 00:54:05.027
LAURA: So he sounds really paranoid and stuff, you know?

1115
00:54:05.027 --> 00:54:07.857
And so I just sending message to him

1116
00:54:07.857 --> 00:54:12.740
to make him more paranoid, sometimes I just do that.

1117
00:54:12.740 --> 00:54:13.573
Is that okay?

1118
00:54:13.573 --> 00:54:17.702
MARISHA: Wait, how long have you been doing that?

1119
00:54:17.702 --> 00:54:21.212
LAURA: Since you told me about him
and we sent that first one.

1120
00:54:21.212 --> 00:54:24.795
MARISHA: Oh, yeah, uh-huh, and him being paranoid.

1121
00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:27.681
Wow, okay, um--

1122
00:54:27.681 --> 00:54:29.573
LAURA: I think he thinks we're responsible for killing

1123
00:54:29.573 --> 00:54:32.704
that other family or something, because he's like,

1124
00:54:32.704 --> 00:54:35.363
"Oh, thank you so much.

1125
00:54:36.327 --> 00:54:38.646
"How can I repay you?"

1126
00:54:38.646 --> 00:54:42.729
SAM: You're a dick.
TRAVIS: Everyone's whiny bitches when you--

1127
00:54:44.879 --> 00:54:45.816
LAURA: Are you okay, Beau?

1128
00:54:45.816 --> 00:54:49.453
MARISHA: Yeah, no, it's okay, it's hot, it's just hot.

1129
00:54:49.453 --> 00:54:52.445
LAURA: Oh no, did I do something wrong?

1130
00:54:52.445 --> 00:54:57.445
MARISHA: No, no, it's just, I think you, yeah.

1131
00:54:58.060 --> 00:55:01.051
I don't know, it's a lot to unpack.

1132
00:55:01.051 --> 00:55:02.412
Yeah, yeah, it's fine.

1133
00:55:02.412 --> 00:55:03.512
LAURA: Oh no.

1134
00:55:05.101 --> 00:55:07.969
That is what I should be apologizing for.

1135
00:55:07.969 --> 00:55:10.284
MARISHA: I mean, you know, um...

1136
00:55:10.284 --> 00:55:13.584
(Travis chuckles)

1137
00:55:13.584 --> 00:55:16.886
Uh, oof, wow, uh...

1138
00:55:16.886 --> 00:55:20.096
You know, you might want to evaluate.

1139
00:55:20.096 --> 00:55:23.835
There might be a pattern of you reaching out

1140
00:55:23.835 --> 00:55:28.835
to, like, personal people connected to our pasts

1141
00:55:29.664 --> 00:55:34.247
without us knowing, which, you know, is a little weird.

1142
00:55:36.513 --> 00:55:38.743
You know, first with Astrid and now--

1143
00:55:38.743 --> 00:55:41.743
LAURA: That was Nott, Nott made me do it!

1144
00:55:42.671 --> 00:55:44.592
But I did it, I did do it.

1145
00:55:44.592 --> 00:55:48.036
MARISHA: Well, yeah, it was a tag team.
LAURA: I thought it was to help Caleb,

1146
00:55:48.036 --> 00:55:49.711
because he missed her so much.

1147
00:55:49.711 --> 00:55:50.809
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

1148
00:55:50.809 --> 00:55:51.694
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1149
00:55:51.694 --> 00:55:55.597
No, I get the intent.

1150
00:55:55.597 --> 00:55:57.045
LAURA: And your dad was really bad to you,

1151
00:55:57.045 --> 00:56:00.185
so I was just trying to make him <i>suffer</i>.

1152
00:56:00.185 --> 00:56:02.768
(laughter)

1153
00:56:05.989 --> 00:56:08.998
MARISHA: Honestly, hearing you say that is super endearing

1154
00:56:08.998 --> 00:56:12.769
and it kind of makes it a little better,

1155
00:56:12.769 --> 00:56:17.352
but not because you're making my dad suffer, but, uh...

1156
00:56:18.478 --> 00:56:19.881
(chuckles)

1157
00:56:19.881 --> 00:56:22.707
Oh, I am trying to process this, Jester.

1158
00:56:22.707 --> 00:56:24.365
LAURA: I'm really sorry, I'm really sorry.

1159
00:56:24.365 --> 00:56:26.856
I won't do it again, Beau, I promise.

1160
00:56:26.856 --> 00:56:30.072
Unless you're sitting there and you're like, "Say this,"

1161
00:56:30.072 --> 00:56:31.923
I won't do it if you're not there.

1162
00:56:31.923 --> 00:56:33.689
MARISHA: Well, so what's interesting is

1163
00:56:33.689 --> 00:56:37.524
he thought that we were--

1164
00:56:37.524 --> 00:56:40.054
what did he say about the other wine family?

1165
00:56:40.054 --> 00:56:43.193
LAURA: Okay, so he thinks that I'm god or something?

1166
00:56:43.193 --> 00:56:45.426
(chuckles) I don't know.

1167
00:56:45.426 --> 00:56:47.754
MARISHA: My staff is caught in my hair.

1168
00:56:47.754 --> 00:56:52.421
LAURA: Oh, we'll fix it, a little band came out.

1169
00:56:54.283 --> 00:56:55.625
I sent a message.
MARISHA: Okay.

1170
00:56:55.625 --> 00:56:57.413
LAURA: I can't remember what I said the first time,

1171
00:56:57.413 --> 00:56:59.364
but he was like, (gasps) and then I was like,

1172
00:56:59.364 --> 00:57:01.144
"Oh, I'm watching you," or something.

1173
00:57:01.144 --> 00:57:05.895
I can't remember exactly and then he sounded like

1174
00:57:05.895 --> 00:57:10.055
worried and he's like,
"Oh, I knew this was going to happen,"

1175
00:57:10.055 --> 00:57:11.922
or something, I can't remember.

1176
00:57:11.922 --> 00:57:15.044
And then, this time I was like, "I'm still watching,"

1177
00:57:15.044 --> 00:57:16.572
"you better behave."

1178
00:57:16.572 --> 00:57:19.502
And he was like, "Oh no," and he said,

1179
00:57:19.502 --> 00:57:21.462
"Are you responsible?

1180
00:57:21.462 --> 00:57:24.502
"Do I have you to thank for helping the competition,"

1181
00:57:24.502 --> 00:57:26.196
or something like that?

1182
00:57:26.196 --> 00:57:30.924
But remember, somebody did something to a family

1183
00:57:30.924 --> 00:57:32.636
over by your family.

1184
00:57:32.636 --> 00:57:33.825
MARISHA: I do remember that.

1185
00:57:33.825 --> 00:57:37.158
LAURA: So I think that's what that was about.

1186
00:57:38.617 --> 00:57:40.908
MARISHA: I think I'm a little concerned that my dad

1187
00:57:40.908 --> 00:57:45.325
feels like he had a part in that.

1188
00:57:46.833 --> 00:57:48.341
Did my dad have a part in that?

1189
00:57:48.341 --> 00:57:50.434
Does my dad think he had a part in that?

1190
00:57:50.434 --> 00:57:55.034
LAURA: Maybe he just thinks that
whoever is looking out for him--

1191
00:57:55.034 --> 00:57:57.623
MARISHA: He's hella superstitious, he like,

1192
00:57:57.623 --> 00:57:59.662
went to fortunetellers and shit.

1193
00:57:59.662 --> 00:58:01.722
That's why he thinks I'm his everloving problem.

1194
00:58:01.722 --> 00:58:03.071
LAURA: I should ask the Traveler!

1195
00:58:03.071 --> 00:58:06.182
Maybe the Traveler has made contact with your dad

1196
00:58:06.182 --> 00:58:10.349
or something and maybe he thinks I'm the Traveler!

1197
00:58:11.583 --> 00:58:15.986
MARISHA: That feels like a jump.

1198
00:58:15.986 --> 00:58:20.235
That feels like a leap, but I'm not saying it's not

1199
00:58:20.235 --> 00:58:22.946
a possibility, it just feels like there may be other--

1200
00:58:22.946 --> 00:58:25.758
LAURA: Well, what we need to figure out, Beau,

1201
00:58:25.758 --> 00:58:28.629
is who your dad thinks is watching him,

1202
00:58:28.629 --> 00:58:31.177
because it didn't seem odd to him that somebody was.

1203
00:58:31.177 --> 00:58:33.324
MARISHA: Well, he rambled his whole fucking life

1204
00:58:33.324 --> 00:58:36.824
about some woman who

1205
00:58:36.824 --> 00:58:38.815
is going to come back for his fortune

1206
00:58:38.815 --> 00:58:43.815
and all this shit, so who fucking knows what he thinks.

1207
00:58:43.867 --> 00:58:46.294
LAURA: There's something there, you should figure it out.

1208
00:58:46.294 --> 00:58:49.715
MARISHA: He just saw some kooky fucking tarot card reader.

1209
00:58:49.715 --> 00:58:53.584
He was always able to get got.

1210
00:58:53.584 --> 00:58:54.896
LAURA: Beau!
MARISHA: What?

1211
00:58:54.896 --> 00:58:56.955
LAURA: Those tarot card readers know what they're doing.

1212
00:58:56.955 --> 00:58:59.155
Think of Molly, he was so smart!

1213
00:58:59.155 --> 00:59:01.814
MARISHA: They're, they're...
(laughter)

1214
00:59:01.814 --> 00:59:06.276
Suggestions, they're not, they're things that can--

1215
00:59:06.276 --> 00:59:09.503
LAURA: Beau, Molly knew things, Molly knew things!

1216
00:59:09.503 --> 00:59:12.491
TALIESIN: That wasn't spit worthy, motherfucker.

1217
00:59:12.491 --> 00:59:14.849
LAURA: He said, when I asked him,

1218
00:59:14.849 --> 00:59:16.057
"I am searching for something,"

1219
00:59:16.057 --> 00:59:18.060
and he's like, "you already know about it,"

1220
00:59:18.060 --> 00:59:19.749
and we already did!

1221
00:59:19.749 --> 00:59:21.289
SAM: Oh, that's true, that's true.

1222
00:59:21.289 --> 00:59:24.206
LAURA: He knew The Gentleman was my dad!

1223
00:59:26.739 --> 00:59:28.666
MARISHA: I don't think tarot cards told him that, though.

1224
00:59:28.666 --> 00:59:33.315
I think he was just Molly and if you shotgun blast

1225
00:59:33.315 --> 00:59:37.295
things into the air like saying you think you know things

1226
00:59:37.295 --> 00:59:40.265
then you're bound to hit one of them.

1227
00:59:40.265 --> 00:59:41.459
LIAM: What's a shotgun?

1228
00:59:41.459 --> 00:59:43.414
LAURA: Beau, don't talk about Molly like that.

1229
00:59:43.414 --> 00:59:46.235
MARISHA: I read about this thing called a Bad News once

1230
00:59:46.235 --> 00:59:48.993
and it would sometimes explode.

1231
00:59:48.993 --> 00:59:50.576
LAURA: Oh, that's weird.

1232
00:59:51.513 --> 00:59:53.082
MARISHA: Yeah, but I'm just saying,

1233
00:59:53.082 --> 00:59:56.121
if you just gamble on being right,

1234
00:59:56.121 --> 00:59:59.902
sometimes you'll be right and I think that was Molly's game.

1235
00:59:59.902 --> 01:00:01.521
LAURA: I don't like thinking about it like that.

1236
01:00:01.521 --> 01:00:03.139
He was just brilliant.

1237
01:00:03.139 --> 01:00:04.369
MARISHA: Well, he <i>was</i> brilliant!

1238
01:00:04.369 --> 01:00:07.772
LAURA: And he saw into the future...

1239
01:00:07.772 --> 01:00:10.254
And he was basically a god.

1240
01:00:10.254 --> 01:00:12.804
MARISHA: He wasn't. None of us are gods.

1241
01:00:12.804 --> 01:00:17.771
(laughter)

1242
01:00:17.771 --> 01:00:22.769
(laughter)

1243
01:00:22.769 --> 01:00:26.769
(laughter)

1244
01:00:26.769 --> 01:00:30.298
MARISHA: Look, I got a tattoo in honor of the guy.

1245
01:00:30.298 --> 01:00:34.415
He taught me a lot about how to balance

1246
01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:37.957
when to bullshit when you know,

1247
01:00:37.957 --> 01:00:41.290
and when's a good time to actually know.

1248
01:00:42.397 --> 01:00:47.397
We are kind of diametrically opposed in that way.

1249
01:00:49.466 --> 01:00:52.746
I appreciate everything he did

1250
01:00:52.746 --> 01:00:55.496
and I miss him every fucking day,

1251
01:00:56.737 --> 01:00:59.884
but tarot cards are fucking bullshit, that's all I'm saying.

1252
01:01:01.217 --> 01:01:05.145
LAURA: Agree to disagree.
MARISHA: All right, that's fair.

1253
01:01:05.145 --> 01:01:08.126
They're fun, and I enjoy them

1254
01:01:08.126 --> 01:01:12.688
and admittedly, I've got some bias because of my dad.

1255
01:01:12.688 --> 01:01:14.337
LAURA: Right, right, right.

1256
01:01:14.337 --> 01:01:17.695
MARISHA: Maybe I can grow to like them again.

1257
01:01:17.695 --> 01:01:19.537
Maybe you should learn.

1258
01:01:21.024 --> 01:01:24.112
Here, I've been basically holding onto them just because

1259
01:01:24.112 --> 01:01:28.082
I wanted them for the tattoo reference for a bit, but...

1260
01:01:28.082 --> 01:01:30.063
TRAVIS: What are you doing?

1261
01:01:30.063 --> 01:01:31.182
SAM: What is this now?

1262
01:01:31.182 --> 01:01:32.531
LAURA: These are tarot cards.

1263
01:01:32.531 --> 01:01:34.954
Hi, Nott.
MARISHA: Hey, Nott, come in.

1264
01:01:34.954 --> 01:01:37.855
SAM: Hi.
LAURA: I'm going to learn tarot cards.

1265
01:01:37.855 --> 01:01:41.104
I'm going to read your future soon, you just wait.

1266
01:01:41.104 --> 01:01:43.206
SAM: I can't-- I can't wait, I would love that.

1267
01:01:43.206 --> 01:01:45.745
LAURA: I'm going to run up the stairs.

1268
01:01:45.745 --> 01:01:47.766
I'm going to run to the room and start practicing.

1269
01:01:47.766 --> 01:01:48.599
MATT: Okay.

1270
01:01:48.599 --> 01:01:50.473
MARISHA: Maybe you can refresh my brain... on...

1271
01:01:50.473 --> 01:01:52.431
yeah, I'll be good.

1272
01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:54.521
LAURA: Thank you, Beau!

1273
01:01:54.521 --> 01:01:57.691
MARISHA: Yeah, bye, Jess and thanks, good talk.

1274
01:01:57.691 --> 01:01:59.329
TALIESIN: I'm going to walk over.

1275
01:01:59.329 --> 01:02:00.889
MARISHA: Hey, Caduceus, come in.

1276
01:02:00.889 --> 01:02:02.172
TALIESIN: This is the most amazing thing.

1277
01:02:02.172 --> 01:02:04.033
MARISHA: Oh, you were here that
whole time in the other room, right?

1278
01:02:04.033 --> 01:02:05.335
TALIESIN: I was, I was.

1279
01:02:05.335 --> 01:02:06.668
This is amazing.

1280
01:02:08.084 --> 01:02:09.982
This is the greatest thing.
SAM: The bone thing?

1281
01:02:09.982 --> 01:02:11.380
TALIESIN: Yeah.
SAM: Yeah, we've heard it.

1282
01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:12.900
TALIESIN: Yeah, you want to try?

1283
01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:13.733
SAM: No.

1284
01:02:13.733 --> 01:02:15.233
MARISHA: Yeah, all right.

1285
01:02:16.626 --> 01:02:18.906
SAM: I'll just roll my ears down.

1286
01:02:18.906 --> 01:02:20.296
(laughter)

1287
01:02:20.296 --> 01:02:21.914
MARISHA: Why did I say yes to this?

1288
01:02:21.914 --> 01:02:23.384
TRAVIS: Go on, play it.

1289
01:02:23.384 --> 01:02:25.013
(Marisha screams)

1290
01:02:25.013 --> 01:02:25.846
TALIESIN: So good.

1291
01:02:26.991 --> 01:02:29.232
MARISHA: I think it's a little tinny.

1292
01:02:29.232 --> 01:02:31.721
I think it sounds better when you do it.

1293
01:02:32.821 --> 01:02:35.471
(Taliesin screams)

1294
01:02:35.471 --> 01:02:37.718
Yeah, it's a little more robust, yeah.

1295
01:02:37.718 --> 01:02:41.669
TALIESIN: This is going to be all
worth it some day, you'll see.

1296
01:02:41.669 --> 01:02:46.669
MATT: You see the elderly dwarf, Kela Camarouth,

1297
01:02:47.294 --> 01:02:48.635
behind you guys at the clerk tables.

1298
01:02:48.635 --> 01:02:51.643
You guys have been in the
main area of the cottage,

1299
01:02:51.643 --> 01:02:53.651
just looking at Fjord doing this.

1300
01:02:53.651 --> 01:02:56.072
(Travis chuckles)

1301
01:02:56.072 --> 01:02:58.248
MARISHA: Hey, Caduceus, you've been here all day.

1302
01:02:58.248 --> 01:02:59.714
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1303
01:02:59.714 --> 01:03:02.966
MARISHA: Where's everybody, are they here?

1304
01:03:02.966 --> 01:03:04.695
SAM: Caleb's over there, reading.

1305
01:03:04.695 --> 01:03:07.054
Fjord is close by.

1306
01:03:07.054 --> 01:03:09.612
TALIESIN: Yasha went out to read,
I don't know why.

1307
01:03:09.612 --> 01:03:11.540
MARISHA: Is she like outside?

1308
01:03:11.540 --> 01:03:14.393
TALIESIN: A park a couple of blocks down,
last I saw her.

1309
01:03:14.393 --> 01:03:16.108
MATT: It's later in the day at
this point, it's probably like

1310
01:03:16.108 --> 01:03:17.665
post-sunset with how much
you're doing your research

1311
01:03:17.665 --> 01:03:20.415
and everything and everyone's
gathering so if you--

1312
01:03:20.415 --> 01:03:23.066
how many hours of reading
do you want to put in?

1313
01:03:23.066 --> 01:03:27.586
ASHLEY: (sighs) Well, I want to
read it as much as I can.

1314
01:03:27.586 --> 01:03:29.466
So get as much reading as I can in.

1315
01:03:29.466 --> 01:03:32.095
So maybe if I take a point of exhaustion

1316
01:03:32.095 --> 01:03:35.074
for that first night, I don't know how that works.

1317
01:03:35.074 --> 01:03:36.687
MATT: You can, if you want to.

1318
01:03:36.687 --> 01:03:38.444
It's your call.

1319
01:03:38.444 --> 01:03:39.874
ASHLEY: (strained) Yeah, why not?

1320
01:03:39.874 --> 01:03:41.751
MATT: Okay.
ASHLEY: Yeah, let's do it.

1321
01:03:41.751 --> 01:03:43.212
MATT: If you're taking a point of exhaustion

1322
01:03:43.212 --> 01:03:45.212
for a night of no sleep,

1323
01:03:46.661 --> 01:03:50.178
then I'll say you can knock out
24 hours in that book.

1324
01:03:50.178 --> 01:03:51.335
SAM: Damn, is this a book

1325
01:03:51.335 --> 01:03:52.754
you have to read for a certain amount of time?

1326
01:03:52.754 --> 01:03:54.375
TALIESIN: Yeah.
LIAM: Before it locks in.

1327
01:03:54.375 --> 01:03:56.332
MATT: Yeah, because you guys aren't
in a stressful situation.

1328
01:03:56.332 --> 01:03:58.249
You have some downtime.

1329
01:03:59.458 --> 01:04:01.091
You're going to have to move locations a few times,

1330
01:04:01.091 --> 01:04:03.281
because at some point in the evening,

1331
01:04:03.281 --> 01:04:06.070
there are some crownsguard that come through

1332
01:04:06.070 --> 01:04:07.651
and usher you out of the garden.

1333
01:04:07.651 --> 01:04:09.734
MARISHA: "Park's closed."
MATT: Yeah.

1334
01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:13.310
But you can continue reading
without issue beyond that

1335
01:04:13.310 --> 01:04:15.019
and make a constitution saving throw.

1336
01:04:15.019 --> 01:04:16.124
LAURA: You can read in the room.

1337
01:04:16.124 --> 01:04:18.207
I'm just going to be there,
practicing tarot cards.

1338
01:04:18.207 --> 01:04:21.857
I won't bother you.
ASHLEY: Okay, well that sounds good.

1339
01:04:21.857 --> 01:04:24.486
TALIESIN: It's a real page-turner.

1340
01:04:24.486 --> 01:04:26.118
LAURA: Ooh!

1341
01:04:26.118 --> 01:04:27.035
ASHLEY: Oh, yeah.

1342
01:04:28.292 --> 01:04:30.895
That would be a 27.

1343
01:04:30.895 --> 01:04:32.082
TRAVIS: Yo, what?

1344
01:04:32.082 --> 01:04:35.620
MATT: Okay, yeah, only a single point of exhaustion

1345
01:04:35.620 --> 01:04:38.458
for the night without getting any sleep.

1346
01:04:38.458 --> 01:04:39.714
ASHLEY: Sorry.
TRAVIS: Nani?

1347
01:04:39.714 --> 01:04:41.999
ASHLEY: 25.
MATT: That's still pretty high.

1348
01:04:41.999 --> 01:04:45.090
Yeah, so one point of exhaustion.
ASHLEY: Okay.

1349
01:04:45.090 --> 01:04:49.942
MATT: And you are tired, but you
finished 24 hours of reading.

1350
01:04:49.942 --> 01:04:51.325
Jester.
LAURA: Huh?

1351
01:04:52.442 --> 01:04:56.191
MATT: Are you going to look up
and research actual books

1352
01:04:56.191 --> 01:04:58.431
on how to read tarot cards
or are you going to make it up?

1353
01:04:58.431 --> 01:05:00.828
SAM: She's going to make it up.

1354
01:05:00.828 --> 01:05:03.428
LIAM: The Traveler will tell her.
LAURA: That's right.

1355
01:05:03.428 --> 01:05:06.188
I'm going to talk to The Traveler to help me out.

1356
01:05:06.188 --> 01:05:07.418
MARISHA: Holy shit, yes.

1357
01:05:07.418 --> 01:05:09.114
LAURA: I'm going to stare at the cards,

1358
01:05:09.114 --> 01:05:11.810
and see what they mean to me.

1359
01:05:11.810 --> 01:05:14.500
What I feel when I look at them.

1360
01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:17.349
TRAVIS: It's pretty accurate.
MARISHA: Yeah.

1361
01:05:17.349 --> 01:05:20.015
MATT: Oh, we have to get Laura

1362
01:05:20.015 --> 01:05:21.607
a set of tarot cards now.

1363
01:05:21.607 --> 01:05:24.000
TALIESIN: I'm already on it.
MATT: I knew you would be.

1364
01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.005
This is your charge, Taliesin.
TALIESIN: I know.

1365
01:05:26.005 --> 01:05:27.753
MATT: To get her the right deck.

1366
01:05:27.753 --> 01:05:31.368
TALIESIN: This is what happened to
my Christmas break, it's okay.

1367
01:05:31.368 --> 01:05:32.824
(laughter)

1368
01:05:32.824 --> 01:05:35.741
I didn't need a break anyway, that's okay.

1369
01:05:35.741 --> 01:05:37.824
SAM: (as Jester) Oh, I am self taught.

1370
01:05:38.938 --> 01:05:41.437
TALIESIN: Fuck.
LAURA: The cards, they speak to me.

1371
01:05:41.437 --> 01:05:43.807
TALIESIN: "Help, help!"

1372
01:05:43.807 --> 01:05:48.807
MATT: The Jester school of tarot reading
was birthed this day.

1373
01:05:49.353 --> 01:05:51.655
All right, great, focus on that.

1374
01:05:51.655 --> 01:05:53.775
You guys have been--

1375
01:05:53.775 --> 01:05:56.255
LIAM: I guess I would've been
there in the common room

1376
01:05:56.255 --> 01:05:58.923
reading and just blushed
and listened to that entire

1377
01:05:58.923 --> 01:06:01.306
insane conversation,
pretending to read a book

1378
01:06:01.306 --> 01:06:02.852
and saying nothing.

1379
01:06:02.852 --> 01:06:06.030
SAM: At some point, I went out
to buy 20 crossbow bolts.

1380
01:06:06.030 --> 01:06:07.151
MATT: Okay, easy enough.

1381
01:06:07.151 --> 01:06:10.703
SAM: And then get an extra 10
that have a rubber tip,

1382
01:06:10.703 --> 01:06:11.870
or a dull tip.

1383
01:06:12.914 --> 01:06:14.575
MATT: What's the intent?

1384
01:06:14.575 --> 01:06:17.525
SAM: Training bolts, for a young child.

1385
01:06:17.525 --> 01:06:18.601
LAURA: Oh.

1386
01:06:18.601 --> 01:06:20.000
MATT: Okay!

1387
01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:20.833
Okay.

1388
01:06:23.512 --> 01:06:26.009
TRAVIS: They have the stud-tip rubber ones.

1389
01:06:26.009 --> 01:06:28.253
MATT: Yeah. That can be done.

1390
01:06:28.253 --> 01:06:30.611
It'll cost, I'll say for the...

1391
01:06:31.894 --> 01:06:33.776
You're having them custom made,
you're having existing

1392
01:06:33.776 --> 01:06:35.474
bolts being retrofitted in that way

1393
01:06:35.474 --> 01:06:39.872
so it is an additional bit
of work I'd say for 10 bolts,

1394
01:06:39.872 --> 01:06:41.410
beyond the cost of what it would be,

1395
01:06:41.410 --> 01:06:43.571
it's an additional five silver.

1396
01:06:43.571 --> 01:06:46.162
That's not too expensive.
LAURA: That's going to hurt so bad.

1397
01:06:46.162 --> 01:06:48.754
MATT: Oh, yeah, no, it's
going to fuck someone up.

1398
01:06:48.754 --> 01:06:50.262
SAM: Rubber bullet.

1399
01:06:50.262 --> 01:06:51.407
TALIESIN: It'll put an eye out.

1400
01:06:51.407 --> 01:06:56.057
MATT: It's a rubber bullet with a
long iron shaft behind it.

1401
01:06:56.057 --> 01:06:59.873
LAURA: Somebody gave Ronin
a crossbow, a wooden crossbow.

1402
01:07:01.399 --> 01:07:03.393
With little ones with a rubber tip.

1403
01:07:03.393 --> 01:07:04.824
SAM: Yeah, you can get them
at the ren faire.

1404
01:07:04.824 --> 01:07:07.522
LAURA: I shot them. They fucking suck
when you're hit. It hurts.

1405
01:07:07.522 --> 01:07:08.696
MATT: I can imagine.

1406
01:07:08.696 --> 01:07:12.402
All righty so you go ahead
and get that made, perfect.

1407
01:07:12.402 --> 01:07:13.981
Fjord, anything you wanted to tackle,

1408
01:07:13.981 --> 01:07:16.691
aside from just meditating?

1409
01:07:16.691 --> 01:07:19.682
TRAVIS: Meditating, working out

1410
01:07:19.682 --> 01:07:22.403
and underground fighting pits.

1411
01:07:22.403 --> 01:07:24.497
MARISHA: Which, I get back, and we talk about that.

1412
01:07:24.497 --> 01:07:26.804
TRAVIS: Yeah, look, I mean, the ocean--
MARISHA: You in for this, Yasha?!

1413
01:07:26.804 --> 01:07:29.577
The ocean has people on top
of the water, in the water

1414
01:07:29.577 --> 01:07:30.911
and the bottom of the water.

1415
01:07:30.911 --> 01:07:33.042
MATT: It'll cut from some of your reading time.

1416
01:07:33.042 --> 01:07:35.687
ASHLEY: Okay, so we have two days,
so maybe I'll take--

1417
01:07:35.687 --> 01:07:37.778
MATT: Well, you can more than two days.

1418
01:07:37.778 --> 01:07:41.087
It's yours guys' call with
the time you want to take.

1419
01:07:41.087 --> 01:07:42.764
TRAVIS: If we're really going to know Rexxentrum,

1420
01:07:42.764 --> 01:07:46.308
we have to like, <i>know</i> Rexxentrum.

1421
01:07:46.308 --> 01:07:49.250
TALIESIN: I would say maybe you
can finish your reading,

1422
01:07:49.250 --> 01:07:50.930
they can research where to go to fight

1423
01:07:50.930 --> 01:07:53.156
and last night out, we have a big party,

1424
01:07:53.156 --> 01:07:56.468
and that's our big out is a--

1425
01:07:56.468 --> 01:07:58.536
ASHLEY: Yeah, hell yeah.
TALIESIN: Is a fisticuffs.

1426
01:07:58.536 --> 01:07:59.869
ASHLEY: I'm into that.

1427
01:08:01.046 --> 01:08:03.407
MARISHA: You're just going to have to
get some sort of daytime nap.

1428
01:08:03.407 --> 01:08:05.574
ASHLEY: Yeah, I can get a little nap in.

1429
01:08:05.574 --> 01:08:06.913
I actually prefer, sort of,

1430
01:08:06.913 --> 01:08:09.383
I don't like sleeping in one chunk of time.

1431
01:08:09.383 --> 01:08:10.216
TRAVIS: Whoa.

1432
01:08:10.216 --> 01:08:13.257
ASHLEY: I sort of like putting it in spurts.

1433
01:08:13.257 --> 01:08:15.129
TRAVIS: Power naps.
ASHLEY: Little power naps.

1434
01:08:15.129 --> 01:08:16.667
LIAM: Grazing, grazing like a deer.

1435
01:08:16.667 --> 01:08:17.500
ASHLEY: Yeah.

1436
01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:20.277
TRAVIS: Can you sleep sitting up,
or standing, even?

1437
01:08:20.277 --> 01:08:21.682
ASHLEY: I can sleep anywhere.

1438
01:08:21.682 --> 01:08:23.391
TRAVIS: What about eyes open?

1439
01:08:23.391 --> 01:08:25.271
ASHLEY: I've never tried it.

1440
01:08:25.271 --> 01:08:26.711
TRAVIS: Try now.

1441
01:08:26.711 --> 01:08:29.779
(chuckles)

1442
01:08:29.779 --> 01:08:32.009
ASHLEY: Are my eyes still open?
TRAVIS: They are.

1443
01:08:32.009 --> 01:08:33.677
Are you sleeping?
ASHLEY: I'm sleeping.

1444
01:08:33.677 --> 01:08:36.260
(laughter)

1445
01:08:38.169 --> 01:08:40.563
I don't think I can sleep
with my eyes open, Fjord.

1446
01:08:40.563 --> 01:08:43.164
(laughter)

1447
01:08:43.164 --> 01:08:45.964
TALIESIN: Maybe if it was like really dark.

1448
01:08:45.964 --> 01:08:48.481
ASHLEY: If it was dark enough,
when a room gets really dark

1449
01:08:48.481 --> 01:08:50.640
and then you go like this and then open them

1450
01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:52.115
and you can't tell the difference.

1451
01:08:52.115 --> 01:08:53.122
TRAVIS: When you go like what?

1452
01:08:53.122 --> 01:08:56.061
ASHLEY: When you're like-- and you
can't tell if they're closed

1453
01:08:56.061 --> 01:08:59.269
or open because it's super dark.

1454
01:08:59.269 --> 01:09:01.139
TALIESIN: Were you asleep just then?
ASHLEY: No.

1455
01:09:01.139 --> 01:09:02.481
TALIESIN: Oh, okay, I was trying to catch ya.

1456
01:09:02.481 --> 01:09:04.137
ASHLEY: Yeah, I wish I could fall asleep that fast.

1457
01:09:04.137 --> 01:09:05.887
TALIESIN: That'd be so great.

1458
01:09:07.486 --> 01:09:08.872
SAM: What's the plan, guys?

1459
01:09:08.872 --> 01:09:10.952
MATT: All right, so are you going to join them,

1460
01:09:10.952 --> 01:09:12.098
or are you staying to read?

1461
01:09:12.098 --> 01:09:13.662
ASHLEY: No, I'm going to join them.

1462
01:09:13.662 --> 01:09:16.262
MATT: Okay, so I'd say we'll subtract the time

1463
01:09:16.262 --> 01:09:18.152
you guys are out from your reading time.

1464
01:09:18.152 --> 01:09:19.818
So just keep that in mind.
ASHLEY: I'll keep that in mind.

1465
01:09:19.818 --> 01:09:23.508
MATT: All right, so, you guys are
looking for a fighting pit.

1466
01:09:23.508 --> 01:09:26.548
LAURA: Do we all get to go and watch it?

1467
01:09:26.548 --> 01:09:28.632
Are you going to let us know that you're going?

1468
01:09:28.632 --> 01:09:29.665
MARISHA: Yeah.

1469
01:09:29.665 --> 01:09:32.023
Hey, guys, we're going to the fighting pit!

1470
01:09:32.023 --> 01:09:33.732
LAURA: Ooh, I'll go!

1471
01:09:33.732 --> 01:09:35.130
MARISHA: Or we're going go to look for one.

1472
01:09:35.130 --> 01:09:37.717
TRAVIS: If there is-- yeah, we have to locate it first.

1473
01:09:37.717 --> 01:09:39.370
MARISHA: There's always a fighting pit.

1474
01:09:39.370 --> 01:09:41.152
LIAM: There are fighting pits in the city.

1475
01:09:41.152 --> 01:09:43.494
TRAVIS: Oh, shit, yeah, why did we not ask Caleb?

1476
01:09:43.494 --> 01:09:46.044
LAURA: Caleb, have you gone to them?
SAM: He's not a fighting pit type.

1477
01:09:46.044 --> 01:09:47.546
MATT: Make a history check.

1478
01:09:47.546 --> 01:09:51.405
TRAVIS: I mean, look, he's got
the wraps, he's like Bloodsport.

1479
01:09:51.405 --> 01:09:52.698
MARISHA: Scrappy, yeah.

1480
01:09:52.698 --> 01:09:53.637
LIAM: That's a one.

1481
01:09:53.637 --> 01:09:55.352
(Laura laughs)

1482
01:09:55.352 --> 01:09:58.329
MATT: I mean, like, you assume. (laughs)

1483
01:09:58.329 --> 01:10:01.910
LIAM: I've heard people, maybe not in this city,

1484
01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:03.283
talk about fighting pits,

1485
01:10:03.283 --> 01:10:07.672
but I've heard of fighting pits in cities, so ergo--

1486
01:10:07.672 --> 01:10:12.672
ASHLEY: Sometimes like what
we would do in my tribe

1487
01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:16.152
is you would just go out
into the middle of the square

1488
01:10:16.152 --> 01:10:19.699
and then you would punch somebody
and they would get upset

1489
01:10:19.699 --> 01:10:22.489
and then you would just start fighting.

1490
01:10:22.489 --> 01:10:24.569
LAURA: Oh, like a city brawl.

1491
01:10:24.569 --> 01:10:28.046
LIAM: You mean like you assault someone
and then a fight begins?

1492
01:10:28.046 --> 01:10:29.463
ASHLEY: What's assault?

1493
01:10:30.966 --> 01:10:32.767
LIAM: That's when you fight and go to jail.

1494
01:10:32.767 --> 01:10:33.600
ASHLEY: Oh.

1495
01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:35.940
LAURA: Yeah, it's probably a bad idea.
ASHLEY: That's a bad thing.

1496
01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:39.268
LAURA: Especially coming so fast
coming off of like, you know--

1497
01:10:39.268 --> 01:10:40.807
TALIESIN: I always heard it was the opposite of pepper.

1498
01:10:40.807 --> 01:10:42.756
SAM: Keller, Keller? Is that your name?

1499
01:10:42.756 --> 01:10:44.089
MATT: "Kela?"
SAM: Kela!

1500
01:10:45.407 --> 01:10:49.417
Any fighting pits round here?

1501
01:10:49.417 --> 01:10:51.529
MATT: "Not that I know of."

1502
01:10:51.529 --> 01:10:54.599
SAM: You have a concierge or something who might?

1503
01:10:54.599 --> 01:10:56.530
MATT: She points to one of her grandchildren

1504
01:10:56.530 --> 01:10:59.071
who's over in the corner digging
his finger deep into his nose.

1505
01:10:59.071 --> 01:11:00.831
SAM: Oh, the teens!
MARISHA: Fucking kids!

1506
01:11:00.831 --> 01:11:02.562
You know.
SAM: They'll know.

1507
01:11:02.562 --> 01:11:04.725
SAM: Hey, teen, get over here!

1508
01:11:04.725 --> 01:11:06.609
(laughter)

1509
01:11:06.609 --> 01:11:08.284
MATT: "What's up?"
TRAVIS: "Hey, teen."

1510
01:11:10.072 --> 01:11:13.522
SAM: Hey, fellow teen, come on over here.

1511
01:11:13.522 --> 01:11:15.472
MATT: "No, I'm good."

1512
01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:20.159
SAM: I'll put out a little--
uh, what do I got?

1513
01:11:20.159 --> 01:11:22.639
I'll pull out my flask.

1514
01:11:22.639 --> 01:11:23.472
LAURA: Oh.

1515
01:11:24.887 --> 01:11:26.866
(Marisha laughs)

1516
01:11:26.866 --> 01:11:28.081
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

1517
01:11:28.081 --> 01:11:30.850
TRAVIS: Are you giving alcohol
to an underage person?

1518
01:11:30.850 --> 01:11:32.906
LIAM: I mean, he's a dwarf,
he's probably like 45.

1519
01:11:32.906 --> 01:11:34.675
SAM: Is it persuasion?
MATT: Yes.

1520
01:11:34.675 --> 01:11:37.886
SAM: Oh, I get a plus two on persuasion,
when did that happen?

1521
01:11:37.886 --> 01:11:39.262
Bringing it to five.

1522
01:11:39.262 --> 01:11:41.635
(laughter)

1523
01:11:41.635 --> 01:11:44.966
MATT: He goes, "Grandma!"

1524
01:11:44.966 --> 01:11:48.463
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait, oh, no, hey!

1525
01:11:48.463 --> 01:11:50.435
LAURA: Wait, wait, do you want candy?

1526
01:11:50.435 --> 01:11:53.166
(laughter)

1527
01:11:53.166 --> 01:11:55.496
MATT: He leaves the room.

1528
01:11:55.496 --> 01:11:57.016
He's been made uncomfortable.

1529
01:11:57.016 --> 01:11:58.216
SAM: There was two of them, right?

1530
01:11:58.216 --> 01:11:59.965
MARISHA: Yeeza and Poma.
LIAM: Yeeza and Poma.

1531
01:11:59.965 --> 01:12:01.852
SAM: Maybe that was Poma, we need Yeeza.

1532
01:12:01.852 --> 01:12:04.038
MARISHA: Where do I see Yeeza?

1533
01:12:04.038 --> 01:12:05.909
Which one has a crush on me?

1534
01:12:05.909 --> 01:12:08.995
MATT: You have a high wisdom and
a fairly decent insight.

1535
01:12:08.995 --> 01:12:10.928
MARISHA: I fail to recognize faces.

1536
01:12:10.928 --> 01:12:13.678
MATT: Right, no, no, these
children probably wouldn't

1537
01:12:13.678 --> 01:12:17.066
have information regarding
underground fighting rings.

1538
01:12:17.066 --> 01:12:18.787
MARISHA: Damn it! (laughs)

1539
01:12:18.787 --> 01:12:22.398
MATT: Just saving you the time on this one.

1540
01:12:22.398 --> 01:12:24.656
These kids probably don't get out much.

1541
01:12:24.656 --> 01:12:26.985
MARISHA: All right.
They're lame kids, they suck.

1542
01:12:26.985 --> 01:12:28.886
We got to go elsewhere.

1543
01:12:28.886 --> 01:12:30.716
TRAVIS: We'll work for our supper.

1544
01:12:30.716 --> 01:12:33.936
Let's just go out onto the
street and look for someone

1545
01:12:33.936 --> 01:12:36.336
that would know where this is.

1546
01:12:36.336 --> 01:12:38.837
MATT: Who's helming the search for a fighting pit?

1547
01:12:38.837 --> 01:12:42.404
LIAM: Well, I'm going to stay in and read tonight.

1548
01:12:42.404 --> 01:12:44.635
I have some research to do, but I would--

1549
01:12:44.635 --> 01:12:45.675
MARISHA: No!

1550
01:12:45.675 --> 01:12:47.129
LIAM: I would recommend--
MARISHA: Boo!

1551
01:12:47.129 --> 01:12:49.997
SAM: It's okay, it's okay.
MARISHA: Boo!

1552
01:12:49.997 --> 01:12:51.638
TRAVIS: Come with us.

1553
01:12:51.638 --> 01:12:54.361
LIAM: Nott needs some help, so I
am going to do a bit of work

1554
01:12:54.361 --> 01:12:57.929
and I haven't had the time
to breathe in weeks.

1555
01:12:57.929 --> 01:12:59.816
Try the Mudtop Ward.

1556
01:12:59.816 --> 01:13:02.817
If there is going to be a
fighting pit, it would be there.

1557
01:13:02.817 --> 01:13:03.817
SAM: All right.

1558
01:13:04.788 --> 01:13:06.032
MATT: All right.
MARISHA: Thanks, man.

1559
01:13:06.032 --> 01:13:08.282
MATT: Who's helming the search?

1560
01:13:09.190 --> 01:13:11.081
TRAVIS: I will assist.

1561
01:13:11.081 --> 01:13:13.081
LAURA: I'll help, I'll do it.

1562
01:13:14.022 --> 01:13:15.903
TRAVIS: Oh, oh, no!

1563
01:13:15.903 --> 01:13:17.294
How does that happen?

1564
01:13:17.294 --> 01:13:19.385
LAURA: Nobody said anything so I did.

1565
01:13:19.385 --> 01:13:22.722
MATT: So Jester steps up to the plate.
TRAVIS: Where are you, come on!

1566
01:13:22.722 --> 01:13:25.838
MARISHA: Choice in a vacuum, I'm sorry.

1567
01:13:25.838 --> 01:13:28.996
MATT: And begins the process of
looking for seedy locales

1568
01:13:28.996 --> 01:13:31.748
throughout the Mudtop Ward

1569
01:13:31.748 --> 01:13:36.005
that might have people that they can talk to

1570
01:13:36.005 --> 01:13:38.273
that <i>she</i> can talk to, assisted by you, Fjord.

1571
01:13:38.273 --> 01:13:41.241
LAURA: I'm used to seeing some shady characters.

1572
01:13:41.241 --> 01:13:43.866
MATT: I would like you to make
an investigation check with advantage.

1573
01:13:43.866 --> 01:13:45.505
MARISHA: Oh, I thought he would do perception.

1574
01:13:45.505 --> 01:13:46.694
Nope, I should've done this.
LAURA: You should have done it.

1575
01:13:46.694 --> 01:13:49.064
TRAVIS: Yep, that's what I was looking at you for.

1576
01:13:49.064 --> 01:13:52.505
SAM: I just realized, I could've used
my reliable talent on the persuasion.

1577
01:13:52.505 --> 01:13:54.566
LAURA: Nine!

1578
01:13:54.566 --> 01:13:56.615
Are you going to guide me?

1579
01:13:56.615 --> 01:13:59.032
SAM: I have that now.
TRAVIS: That was with advantage, was nine?

1580
01:13:59.032 --> 01:14:01.570
SAM: It still would've only been 12.

1581
01:14:01.570 --> 01:14:04.144
LAURA: Yep.
TALIESIN: Very low investigation.

1582
01:14:04.144 --> 01:14:06.712
LAURA: I have really low investigation,
I have good perception.

1583
01:14:06.712 --> 01:14:10.352
MATT: So it's not so much you don't know

1584
01:14:10.352 --> 01:14:13.112
where to find the places, that's part of it,

1585
01:14:13.112 --> 01:14:14.830
but the places you do find

1586
01:14:14.830 --> 01:14:17.246
your special brand of...

1587
01:14:18.363 --> 01:14:20.042
personal engagement

1588
01:14:20.042 --> 01:14:23.954
seems to be a little less, I don't know, trustworthy.

1589
01:14:23.954 --> 01:14:27.424
LAURA: I don't know what
you're talking about, Matthew.

1590
01:14:27.424 --> 01:14:30.544
MATT: A few of the rougher
subjects you come across

1591
01:14:30.544 --> 01:14:32.447
tend to shut you down rather quickly.

1592
01:14:32.447 --> 01:14:33.489
LAURA: Fighting?

1593
01:14:33.489 --> 01:14:34.936
Fighting?

1594
01:14:34.936 --> 01:14:36.954
MATT: (gruff voice) "I don't what
you're talking about there,"

1595
01:14:36.954 --> 01:14:38.877
and just walks the other direction.

1596
01:14:38.877 --> 01:14:41.869
You spend the next hour or so
following Jester's lead

1597
01:14:41.869 --> 01:14:44.720
and it's just like every film montage

1598
01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:48.429
where there's doors slamming. (mimics slams)

1599
01:14:48.429 --> 01:14:50.298
LAURA: I don't think the city has any.

1600
01:14:50.298 --> 01:14:52.488
Sorry, guys.
SAM: Caleb said they had some!

1601
01:14:52.488 --> 01:14:54.263
MARISHA: Here, let's, um--

1602
01:14:54.263 --> 01:14:55.812
did we pass a dive bar?

1603
01:14:57.117 --> 01:14:58.950
MATT: You've passed a few.

1604
01:14:59.864 --> 01:15:02.298
MARISHA: Which one looked the most skeezy?

1605
01:15:02.298 --> 01:15:04.018
MATT: That would be the Grim Shelf Tavern.

1606
01:15:04.018 --> 01:15:06.637
MARISHA: Let's go back to
that place, get a drink.

1607
01:15:06.637 --> 01:15:08.596
Sit for a minute.

1608
01:15:08.596 --> 01:15:12.037
SAM: Maybe if we ask one more person,
maybe the barkeep there

1609
01:15:12.037 --> 01:15:16.912
or some shady big fellow or
big lady with some muscles.

1610
01:15:18.305 --> 01:15:21.683
MARISHA: What was it called?
TRAVIS: The Grim Shelf Tavern.

1611
01:15:21.683 --> 01:15:23.375
MATT: It's a small dive.

1612
01:15:23.375 --> 01:15:25.050
It's maybe...

1613
01:15:26.623 --> 01:15:27.812
30 by 20 feet.

1614
01:15:27.812 --> 01:15:30.412
It's a little closet of a bar.

1615
01:15:30.412 --> 01:15:34.281
It sits maybe 12 people
total and as you walk in,

1616
01:15:34.281 --> 01:15:37.111
there's already eight folk that are drinking

1617
01:15:37.111 --> 01:15:39.998
that all look to be, I don't know,

1618
01:15:39.998 --> 01:15:43.981
anywhere from the range of grizzled miners to

1619
01:15:46.646 --> 01:15:49.584
cutthroats to beggars,

1620
01:15:49.584 --> 01:15:53.044
and there's conservation at
certain tables and some people

1621
01:15:53.044 --> 01:15:55.001
that are playing cards,
and as soon as you enter

1622
01:15:55.001 --> 01:15:58.172
the building, everyone turns
and the room gets quiet

1623
01:15:58.172 --> 01:16:00.710
and watches you as you enter.

1624
01:16:00.710 --> 01:16:04.073
TRAVIS: Does the inside of the tavern
match the outside footprint?

1625
01:16:04.073 --> 01:16:05.752
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

1626
01:16:05.752 --> 01:16:07.971
MATT: Make an intelligence check.
MARISHA: What he says.

1627
01:16:07.971 --> 01:16:11.138
Before we-- we just peek open the door.

1628
01:16:13.259 --> 01:16:14.102
TRAVIS: 21.

1629
01:16:14.102 --> 01:16:15.602
MATT: 21, it seems to.

1630
01:16:16.654 --> 01:16:19.022
MARISHA: Should we go to another one
that's, like, bigger?

1631
01:16:19.022 --> 01:16:21.494
Is this wrong, is this the wrong choice?

1632
01:16:21.494 --> 01:16:23.380
TRAVIS: I don't know.

1633
01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:26.294
If it's not here, I feel like someone in here

1634
01:16:26.294 --> 01:16:28.798
knows where it would be.

1635
01:16:28.798 --> 01:16:31.661
MARISHA: All right.
TRAVIS: Hold on. Yasha?

1636
01:16:31.661 --> 01:16:34.469
ASHLEY: You want me to go ask somebody?

1637
01:16:34.469 --> 01:16:37.548
Okay, so I'm going to walk inside.

1638
01:16:37.548 --> 01:16:39.077
MATT: Is <i>she</i> just going in?

1639
01:16:39.077 --> 01:16:40.616
TRAVIS: No, no, I'll go in with her.

1640
01:16:40.616 --> 01:16:43.389
MATT: Okay, so Fjord and Yasha,
you guys enter,

1641
01:16:43.389 --> 01:16:47.141
the room quiets, they
watch as you walk in.

1642
01:16:47.141 --> 01:16:50.142
Eventually they go back
to their muttered conversations

1643
01:16:50.142 --> 01:16:52.141
and drinks and card games.

1644
01:16:52.141 --> 01:16:54.774
You can see at the edge of the bar

1645
01:16:54.774 --> 01:16:59.774
there is a burly-looking man
probably in his early 60s or so.

1646
01:16:59.974 --> 01:17:03.790
Imagine, if you will, a very, very

1647
01:17:03.790 --> 01:17:05.993
even more sunburned

1648
01:17:05.993 --> 01:17:07.118
Hulk Hogan.

1649
01:17:08.711 --> 01:17:13.711
Like, right now Hulk Hogan with this stained

1650
01:17:13.951 --> 01:17:18.951
cloth apron on, sleeves rolled up,
tattooed forearms,

1651
01:17:19.033 --> 01:17:22.753
looking forward with the
full skullet going down,

1652
01:17:22.753 --> 01:17:24.371
as opposed to the Hogan 'stache,

1653
01:17:24.371 --> 01:17:27.361
it's a just beard goatee mess right here.

1654
01:17:27.361 --> 01:17:29.022
Probably has three teeth in his mouth

1655
01:17:29.022 --> 01:17:31.593
and as you walk up, he looks over.

1656
01:17:31.593 --> 01:17:33.593
"So what can I get ya?"

1657
01:17:35.487 --> 01:17:37.595
ASHLEY: Actually, yeah, we had

1658
01:17:37.595 --> 01:17:39.453
a-a question.

1659
01:17:41.218 --> 01:17:46.151
Are there any, you know,
fighting pits around here

1660
01:17:46.151 --> 01:17:50.926
where you can sort of have
a little play time?

1661
01:17:52.261 --> 01:17:53.981
If you know what I mean.

1662
01:17:53.981 --> 01:17:57.647
MATT: "Why? Are you two looking to
go get your arses beat?"

1663
01:17:57.647 --> 01:18:01.431
MATT: No, we're looking to
go beat asses, so.

1664
01:18:03.927 --> 01:18:06.094
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

1665
01:18:07.299 --> 01:18:08.939
ASHLEY: Okay. (chuckles)

1666
01:18:08.939 --> 01:18:10.389
TRAVIS: I will assist!

1667
01:18:10.389 --> 01:18:12.788
MATT: Okay, what do you say to assist?

1668
01:18:12.788 --> 01:18:15.826
TRAVIS: You know, we have lots
of coin to spend,

1669
01:18:15.826 --> 01:18:20.437
and frustration to get out,
we are rather unintimidating.

1670
01:18:20.437 --> 01:18:22.604
It couldn't hurt to share.

1671
01:18:25.130 --> 01:18:28.346
ASHLEY: Now is this persuasion or
is this intimidation?

1672
01:18:28.346 --> 01:18:30.830
MATT: Depends on how you want to take it.

1673
01:18:30.830 --> 01:18:32.910
ASHLEY: I want it to be intimidating.

1674
01:18:32.910 --> 01:18:36.262
MATT: So how are you intimidating?

1675
01:18:36.262 --> 01:18:37.819
So as you're talking in this conversation,

1676
01:18:37.819 --> 01:18:41.680
she changes tracks on this.
(laughter)

1677
01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:44.150
So you're like "Hm, got some coin to spend."

1678
01:18:44.150 --> 01:18:47.108
ASHLEY: Not necessarily intimidating him,

1679
01:18:47.108 --> 01:18:49.168
but just looking tough where he'd be like,

1680
01:18:49.168 --> 01:18:52.617
"Oh, yeah, they want to go have a good time."

1681
01:18:52.617 --> 01:18:55.159
I think-- I don't know.

1682
01:18:55.159 --> 01:18:58.456
I'm persuading him, I'll take it,

1683
01:18:58.456 --> 01:19:02.017
It's a negative two, I was
trying to persuade the DM.

1684
01:19:02.017 --> 01:19:05.177
MATT: I understand, I understand.
(laughter)

1685
01:19:05.177 --> 01:19:06.010
ASHLEY: 11.

1686
01:19:06.010 --> 01:19:08.163
SAM: Did you roll with advantage?

1687
01:19:08.163 --> 01:19:11.246
MATT: Yeah, because he's helping you.
ASHLEY: That's right, that's right. Okay.

1688
01:19:12.541 --> 01:19:13.916
Yes! Okay.

1689
01:19:15.101 --> 01:19:16.640
17.

1690
01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:19.014
LAURA: That's better.
MATT: 17, that's much better.

1691
01:19:19.014 --> 01:19:20.005
He goes,

1692
01:19:23.619 --> 01:19:25.536
"Yeah, I know a place.

1693
01:19:26.938 --> 01:19:28.388
"Not here, though.

1694
01:19:29.789 --> 01:19:32.748
"You ever heard of the Stone Coffin?"

1695
01:19:32.748 --> 01:19:35.367
TRAVIS: Well, I don't believe we have, no.

1696
01:19:35.367 --> 01:19:38.637
MATT: "Well, that's the place you'll be looking for.

1697
01:19:38.637 --> 01:19:39.624
"(chuckles)"

1698
01:19:39.624 --> 01:19:41.100
ASHLEY: The Stone Coffin.

1699
01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:45.683
MATT: "It's a basement ring beneath
the King's Cut Butchery.

1700
01:19:47.504 --> 01:19:52.337
"You'll need to ask the owner,
the proprietor, Jacquel Brome.

1701
01:19:54.624 --> 01:19:57.304
"Say you're for the Stone Coffin.

1702
01:19:57.304 --> 01:20:00.263
"She'll probably take care of you from there."

1703
01:20:00.263 --> 01:20:01.492
ASHLEY: <i>She'll</i> take care of us.

1704
01:20:01.492 --> 01:20:04.049
TRAVIS: Jacquel Brond?
MATT: "Jacquel Brome."

1705
01:20:04.049 --> 01:20:05.207
TRAVIS: Brome.

1706
01:20:07.084 --> 01:20:11.325
ASHLEY: Basement beneath the, the King--

1707
01:20:11.325 --> 01:20:13.145
MATT: "The King's Cut Butchery."

1708
01:20:13.145 --> 01:20:14.978
ASHLEY: King's Cut Butchery.

1709
01:20:16.087 --> 01:20:19.857
TRAVIS: Fantastic, I appreciate you
sharing what you know.

1710
01:20:19.857 --> 01:20:23.097
And I'll slide two silver across the bar.

1711
01:20:23.097 --> 01:20:25.191
MATT: He goes (coughs).

1712
01:20:26.383 --> 01:20:29.462
TRAVIS: Take it back and I'll
slide a gold across the bar.

1713
01:20:29.462 --> 01:20:32.134
MATT: "Pleasure doing business
with the both of you.

1714
01:20:32.134 --> 01:20:32.967
"Hey.

1715
01:20:34.281 --> 01:20:37.379
"May Kord look down upon your glory."

1716
01:20:37.379 --> 01:20:39.593
He takes the silver and puts it away.

1717
01:20:39.593 --> 01:20:40.426
TRAVIS: Dope.

1718
01:20:43.190 --> 01:20:44.101
ASHLEY: Thank you.

1719
01:20:44.101 --> 01:20:47.162
MATT: You see, he probably noticed
the not very well hidden

1720
01:20:47.162 --> 01:20:50.693
symbol on your belt buckle and
got a spark in his eye.

1721
01:20:50.693 --> 01:20:53.381
Not the kind of the person
that would turn you in for

1722
01:20:53.381 --> 01:20:55.298
unapproved iconography.

1723
01:20:56.219 --> 01:20:59.436
ASHLEY: I give him a nod and
remember that that symbol

1724
01:20:59.436 --> 01:21:02.828
is out and about and I cover it.

1725
01:21:04.037 --> 01:21:07.367
TRAVIS: I don't know, maybe just like
loud and proud, why not?

1726
01:21:07.367 --> 01:21:10.295
ASHLEY: Well, I think in these parts--

1727
01:21:10.295 --> 01:21:13.128
TRAVIS: It's not okay, this is not okay.

1728
01:21:14.917 --> 01:21:17.582
I mean, we have a little bit of favor.

1729
01:21:17.582 --> 01:21:20.685
ASHLEY: Yeah, but I feel like the
Wildmother is so different.

1730
01:21:22.293 --> 01:21:27.293
TRAVIS: Still not technically legal or
allowed or permitted, but--

1731
01:21:29.853 --> 01:21:33.495
ASHLEY: Okay, well then, I'll show it.

1732
01:21:34.955 --> 01:21:36.600
MATT: All right.

1733
01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:39.211
So you guys ask around.

1734
01:21:39.211 --> 01:21:42.711
It's nighttime now, it's close to

1735
01:21:43.646 --> 01:21:47.166
10:30 or so by the time you've
gone on a couple of hours

1736
01:21:47.166 --> 01:21:49.507
of wild goose chase.

1737
01:21:49.507 --> 01:21:53.095
SAM: I usually try to sleep by 10.
LAURA: Yeah, me too.

1738
01:21:53.095 --> 01:21:55.234
MATT: So just letting you know at this point,

1739
01:21:55.234 --> 01:21:57.567
it's into the evening.

1740
01:21:58.554 --> 01:22:03.554
Eventually you come upon
a particular building

1741
01:22:03.833 --> 01:22:06.825
that is set between a
high-end hat shop

1742
01:22:06.825 --> 01:22:09.723
called Cy's Toppers that is currently closed

1743
01:22:09.723 --> 01:22:13.341
and a seller of fine pottery
that is also closed.

1744
01:22:13.341 --> 01:22:14.854
But in the center you see what is probably

1745
01:22:14.854 --> 01:22:19.134
the largest butcher shop
you've ever encountered.

1746
01:22:19.134 --> 01:22:21.942
Dozens of salt-rubbed animal carcasses

1747
01:22:21.942 --> 01:22:25.290
hang on hooks on display by the front window.

1748
01:22:25.290 --> 01:22:27.501
Being this late in the evening,

1749
01:22:27.501 --> 01:22:29.700
it looks like it's in the process of closing.

1750
01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:32.094
Like there's maybe two customers still in there.

1751
01:22:32.094 --> 01:22:35.470
You're surprised it's still
open this late for a butchery.

1752
01:22:35.470 --> 01:22:39.082
There's a swinging door that opens and exits.

1753
01:22:39.082 --> 01:22:41.852
As one person steps out holding

1754
01:22:41.852 --> 01:22:46.271
a large cloth-wrapped section of meat

1755
01:22:46.271 --> 01:22:48.684
and pushes past you and you
see one more customer in there

1756
01:22:48.684 --> 01:22:50.463
that's currently giving an order.

1757
01:22:50.463 --> 01:22:52.143
There are other staff that look like

1758
01:22:52.143 --> 01:22:53.474
they're going home for the night,

1759
01:22:53.474 --> 01:22:55.600
that are putting their stuff away.

1760
01:22:56.933 --> 01:22:59.203
You can see there's a plume
of smoke that's rising

1761
01:22:59.203 --> 01:23:02.042
from the chimney and you
can already smell the hickory

1762
01:23:02.042 --> 01:23:04.173
and smoked meats from even just

1763
01:23:04.173 --> 01:23:06.612
a good 10 yards from the front.

1764
01:23:06.612 --> 01:23:09.112
It's a pretty decent butchery.

1765
01:23:11.475 --> 01:23:14.362
As you walk in a bit, pushing the
swinging door to the side,

1766
01:23:14.362 --> 01:23:16.342
you can see there's a number of tables

1767
01:23:16.342 --> 01:23:18.111
where waiting customers would probably sit,

1768
01:23:18.111 --> 01:23:20.822
though it is mostly empty at this point.

1769
01:23:20.822 --> 01:23:22.710
The front counter is where you would imagine

1770
01:23:22.710 --> 01:23:26.139
a whirling bevy of butchers
taking orders would be,

1771
01:23:26.139 --> 01:23:28.828
but right now you can see
there is just one individual

1772
01:23:28.828 --> 01:23:31.330
that is in the process of giving the final cut

1773
01:23:31.330 --> 01:23:33.422
to the previous customer.

1774
01:23:33.422 --> 01:23:38.422
You see a female half-orc,
fit for a woman in her 50s,

1775
01:23:38.950 --> 01:23:41.811
standing about six foot or so

1776
01:23:41.811 --> 01:23:44.159
and is finishing final cuts and then

1777
01:23:44.159 --> 01:23:46.321
handing them over to the last customer

1778
01:23:46.321 --> 01:23:47.879
before looking up to you and goes,

1779
01:23:47.879 --> 01:23:49.629
"Oh, we're closed."

1780
01:23:51.097 --> 01:23:53.377
TRAVIS: Sorry, perhaps you could make an exception.

1781
01:23:53.377 --> 01:23:55.457
We're looking for Jacquel Brome.

1782
01:23:55.457 --> 01:23:58.086
MATT: "You found me, but you can
come by tomorrow when we're open."

1783
01:23:58.086 --> 01:23:59.740
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, I'm just afraid
we wouldn't be able

1784
01:23:59.740 --> 01:24:02.740
to find The Stone's Coffin tomorrow.

1785
01:24:03.918 --> 01:24:07.779
MATT: Make a persuasion check.
(laughter)

1786
01:24:07.779 --> 01:24:08.612
TRAVIS: 18.

1787
01:24:09.482 --> 01:24:10.559
MATT: All right.

1788
01:24:10.559 --> 01:24:11.892
MARISHA: That's still good.

1789
01:24:13.991 --> 01:24:16.529
MATT: "Sorry, I can't help you there.

1790
01:24:16.529 --> 01:24:18.261
"You have to ask somewhere else."

1791
01:24:18.261 --> 01:24:20.369
Waits for the customer to leave and--

1792
01:24:20.369 --> 01:24:22.202
TRAVIS: Understandable, our fault.

1793
01:24:23.826 --> 01:24:26.609
"No type of business in this
part of the city.

1794
01:24:26.609 --> 01:24:27.692
"My apologies.

1795
01:24:29.569 --> 01:24:32.008
"All right, come here."

1796
01:24:32.008 --> 01:24:34.249
Pulls you off into the side office chamber

1797
01:24:34.249 --> 01:24:36.201
where you can see there's a desk.

1798
01:24:36.201 --> 01:24:38.630
It's pretty well furnished.

1799
01:24:38.630 --> 01:24:43.088
Most of the shop looks
pretty simple and functional,

1800
01:24:43.088 --> 01:24:44.830
but the inside of this personal office,

1801
01:24:44.830 --> 01:24:47.169
she has a desk and a
chair and a couple of chairs

1802
01:24:47.169 --> 01:24:48.689
that face the front of the desk

1803
01:24:48.689 --> 01:24:51.457
where either she had
some intense conversations

1804
01:24:51.457 --> 01:24:54.689
with employees, or other people.

1805
01:24:54.689 --> 01:24:57.577
Nice collection of brass
knick knacks across it.

1806
01:24:57.577 --> 01:24:59.657
It's a nice desk.

1807
01:24:59.657 --> 01:25:01.929
It feels out of place for
the rest of the establishment.

1808
01:25:01.929 --> 01:25:04.580
She sits down on the chair,
puts her feet up,

1809
01:25:04.580 --> 01:25:07.028
crossed on the edge of
the table, looks up at you

1810
01:25:07.028 --> 01:25:10.807
with the two curled tusks
that rise from the lower jaw.

1811
01:25:10.807 --> 01:25:13.157
Glances over with a smile.

1812
01:25:13.157 --> 01:25:16.957
"So you both looking to
make some money?"

1813
01:25:18.098 --> 01:25:22.157
TRAVIS: Indeed, or lose it, more for the activity.

1814
01:25:22.157 --> 01:25:24.866
MATT: "See, there's the type of mindset I like.

1815
01:25:24.866 --> 01:25:26.967
"People pay to be entertained.

1816
01:25:26.967 --> 01:25:30.033
"Can make money either way, depending.

1817
01:25:30.033 --> 01:25:31.108
"Depending.

1818
01:25:32.037 --> 01:25:36.634
"Downside, however, is that the
next big fight's in a month,

1819
01:25:36.634 --> 01:25:39.467
"so you kind of missed a big event.

1820
01:25:40.325 --> 01:25:42.882
"But if you're looking to fight soon,

1821
01:25:42.882 --> 01:25:45.299
"I can call in a special bout."

1822
01:25:46.754 --> 01:25:47.988
TRAVIS: Most definitely.

1823
01:25:47.988 --> 01:25:50.530
MATT: "Won't be the run of contenders, but

1824
01:25:50.530 --> 01:25:53.580
"we can call in some of our local usuals

1825
01:25:53.580 --> 01:25:55.202
"for a bit of one-on-one fights.

1826
01:25:55.202 --> 01:25:56.860
"The buy-in's more expensive

1827
01:25:56.860 --> 01:25:59.754
"because I've got to throw it
together on me own time, so--"

1828
01:25:59.754 --> 01:26:00.587
TRAVIS: Oh, of course.

1829
01:26:00.587 --> 01:26:02.124
It's quite a bit of work
on your end, it seems.

1830
01:26:02.124 --> 01:26:05.354
What kind of timeline are
we talking about here?

1831
01:26:05.354 --> 01:26:06.994
MATT: "One day, two days."

1832
01:26:06.994 --> 01:26:08.160
TRAVIS: One day.

1833
01:26:10.314 --> 01:26:12.375
ASHLEY: Tomorrow night?

1834
01:26:12.375 --> 01:26:15.503
Would that work for you?

1835
01:26:15.503 --> 01:26:17.023
MATT: "Depends on what you're asking here.

1836
01:26:17.023 --> 01:26:19.773
"We got two different types of bouts.

1837
01:26:20.690 --> 01:26:23.372
"One of our special bouts is fists.

1838
01:26:23.372 --> 01:26:25.122
"No armor, no weapons.

1839
01:26:26.532 --> 01:26:28.832
"Fight till unconsciousness.

01:26:28.832 --> 01:26:30.920
"Standard buy-in entry for
these special bouts

1841
01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:32.420
"is 75 gold pieces.

"Winner takes 150, plus 10%

01:26:38.564 --> 01:26:41.114
"Unless you want to challenge our champion?"

1844
01:26:41.114 --> 01:26:43.284
TRAVIS: Well, I just couldn't resist not knowing

1845
01:26:43.284 --> 01:26:45.013
what that might be, it
just sounds so interesting.

1846
01:26:45.013 --> 01:26:47.679
MATT: "And there's a 200 gold buy-in.

1847
01:26:47.679 --> 01:26:52.363
"Winner takes 400, and 10%
of the crowd's pot."

1848
01:26:53.589 --> 01:26:55.917
ASHLEY: Who's your champion?

1849
01:26:55.917 --> 01:26:58.595
MATT: "You ever heard of Kal Dimmins?"

1850
01:26:58.595 --> 01:27:00.076
TRAVIS: Kal Dimmins?

1851
01:27:00.076 --> 01:27:01.894
ASHLEY: Kal Dimmins?

1852
01:27:01.894 --> 01:27:03.965
TRAVIS: No, I don't believe so.

1853
01:27:03.965 --> 01:27:07.213
MATT: "Don't worry, she can hit like a truck.

1854
01:27:07.213 --> 01:27:08.604
"There's a reason she's the champion,

"so don't underestimate her.

other random arsehole

"that wants to jump in there with you."

1859
01:27:18.128 --> 01:27:21.157
TRAVIS: Same thing for your champion,
no armor no weapons?

1860
01:27:21.157 --> 01:27:22.782
MATT: "For that sort of bout, yeah.

1861

"There's also steel bouts,
that's armor, weapons,

20% of the crowd's intake.

"Or you could fight our champion there."

1868
01:27:52.171 --> 01:27:54.801
TRAVIS: This is very interesting.

1869
01:27:54.801 --> 01:27:57.443
You are quite handy with a blade.

1870
01:27:57.443 --> 01:28:01.342
MATT: "Buy-in for that, though,
is 600 gold each.

1871
01:28:01.342 --> 01:28:06.062
"Winner takes 1,200 gold pieces,
plus 20% of the crowd's pot."

1872
01:28:06.062 --> 01:28:06.895
SAM: Crikey.

1873
01:28:08.054 --> 01:28:10.721
(Travis laughs)

1874
01:28:12.185 --> 01:28:14.315
MATT: "Do you hear something?"
(laughter)

1875
01:28:14.315 --> 01:28:15.232
TRAVIS: Crickets.

1876
01:28:18.803 --> 01:28:22.393
ASHLEY: There might be a few
more of us that would be

1877
01:28:22.393 --> 01:28:27.393
partaking in the fun, so
I think we need to ask them maybe.

1878
01:28:27.963 --> 01:28:29.771
MATT: "How many are you thinking?

1879
01:28:29.771 --> 01:28:32.081
"If it's a lot, that's going
to be more challenging

1880
01:28:32.081 --> 01:28:34.481
"to put together on a short day's notice."

1881
01:28:34.481 --> 01:28:36.269
TRAVIS: I think by more participants,

1882
01:28:36.269 --> 01:28:38.629
they'll be paying the
standard fee at the door.

1883
01:28:38.629 --> 01:28:41.709
I don't know how many combatants we'll have.

1884
01:28:41.709 --> 01:28:44.890
MATT: "Ah, well there's always participants,

1885
01:28:44.890 --> 01:28:46.359
"watchers, if you want,

1886
01:28:46.359 --> 01:28:49.949
"people to go ahead and put
down some money on it.

1887
01:28:49.949 --> 01:28:52.221
"That's always welcome."

1888
01:28:52.221 --> 01:28:56.418
TRAVIS: I think there might be
two to three combatants

1889
01:28:56.418 --> 01:29:00.325
and our party might be, oh, six or more?

1890
01:29:00.325 --> 01:29:04.978
MATT: "Three I can do, no more,
not for within a few days.

1891
01:29:04.978 --> 01:29:08.036
"You have to wait for the next event
for that one to work out."

1892
01:29:08.036 --> 01:29:09.416
TRAVIS: What do you think?
ASHLEY: Seems fair enough.

1893
01:29:09.416 --> 01:29:13.598
TRAVIS: Unarmed or Magician's Judge?

1894
01:29:13.598 --> 01:29:15.222
ASHLEY: I feel like...

1895
01:29:15.222 --> 01:29:19.246
I feel like an unarmed feels like...

1896
01:29:21.876 --> 01:29:23.709
I feel like I miss it.

1897
01:29:25.745 --> 01:29:28.162
It's been a minute since I've

1898
01:29:29.803 --> 01:29:32.663
hit somebody with just my fist.

1899
01:29:32.663 --> 01:29:37.212
MATT: "So you want to go in there
with just the fists bout, right?"

1900
01:29:37.212 --> 01:29:39.252
ASHLEY: I don't know, what do you think, Fjord?

1901
01:29:39.252 --> 01:29:42.074
TRAVIS: You know!
(laughter)

1902
01:29:42.074 --> 01:29:43.211
ASHLEY: Maybe not.

1903
01:29:43.211 --> 01:29:45.519
TRAVIS: I appreciate your curious nature,

1904
01:29:45.519 --> 01:29:49.321
but I think I would probably
go with the weapons.

1905
01:29:49.321 --> 01:29:50.738
MATT: "Steel and fists?"

1906
01:29:51.592 --> 01:29:54.163
TRAVIS: For me, just--
ASHLEY: We could each do different ones.

1907
01:29:54.163 --> 01:29:56.500
MATT: "No, you're choosing which
one you want to go into.

1908
01:29:56.500 --> 01:29:58.940
"Depends on want you want to pay
for and who you want to fight."

1909
01:29:58.940 --> 01:30:00.320
TRAVIS: But I would defer to you,

1910
01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:02.647
I'm actually more interested in
seeing you doing your thing,

1911
01:30:02.647 --> 01:30:05.505
so if you want to do unarmed,
that's the way we should go.

1912
01:30:07.850 --> 01:30:09.388
ASHLEY: Can I think about it
and decide tomorrow?

1913
01:30:09.388 --> 01:30:10.650
Or do you need to know?

1914
01:30:10.650 --> 01:30:11.918
MATT: "Depends on who I have to get.

1915
01:30:11.918 --> 01:30:13.084
"I have to know who I have to call in here."

1916
01:30:13.084 --> 01:30:14.108
ASHLEY: Yeah, okay.

1917
01:30:14.108 --> 01:30:15.351
LAURA: You guys can do different ones.

1918
01:30:15.351 --> 01:30:17.856
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm going to do unarmed.

1919
01:30:17.856 --> 01:30:21.475
MATT: "So we've got one for fists,
standard or champion?"

1920
01:30:21.475 --> 01:30:24.394
LAURA: Yeah, do your own thing.
ASHLEY: Champion.

1921
01:30:24.394 --> 01:30:25.663
MARISHA: Fisticuffs, hell yeah, man.

1922
01:30:25.663 --> 01:30:27.879
MATT: She gives you a look over.

1923
01:30:29.413 --> 01:30:33.830
"You look like you've seen
some toughness in your day."

1924
01:30:34.971 --> 01:30:36.001
ASHLEY: You could say that.

1925
01:30:36.001 --> 01:30:39.741
MATT: "Got some scars, got some arms on ya.

1926
01:30:39.741 --> 01:30:40.574
"All right.

1927
01:30:41.650 --> 01:30:42.483
"200 gold."

1928
01:30:43.708 --> 01:30:44.625
ASHLEY: 200 gold.

1929
01:30:45.949 --> 01:30:47.965
Okay, yeah.

1930
01:30:48.990 --> 01:30:51.173
That's worth a little
night of happiness.

1931
01:30:53.156 --> 01:30:54.156
MATT: "All right."

1932
01:30:57.163 --> 01:30:59.395
TRAVIS: And I will be able to
speak on behalf of our

1933
01:30:59.395 --> 01:31:02.923
third combatant, I believe
she will also partake

1934
01:31:02.923 --> 01:31:05.744
in unarmed combat.

1935
01:31:05.744 --> 01:31:08.243
MATT: "All right."
TRAVIS: Not a champion's fight.

1936
01:31:08.243 --> 01:31:10.847
And for myself, the steel.

1937
01:31:10.847 --> 01:31:12.801
LAURA: (whispering) Not the champion's fight?
MATT: "All right.

1938
01:31:12.801 --> 01:31:17.791
"So 75 gold pieces for your
compatriot into standard."

1939
01:31:17.791 --> 01:31:20.859
TRAVIS: 75 and mine. And mine was--?

1940
01:31:20.859 --> 01:31:23.209
MATT: "Yours is 200 for the standard entry,

1941
01:31:23.209 --> 01:31:25.082
or 600 if you want to go against the champion."

1942
01:31:25.082 --> 01:31:27.003
TRAVIS: I'll go standard.
MATT: "Standard."

1943
01:31:27.003 --> 01:31:27.956
TRAVIS: So 275.

1944
01:31:27.956 --> 01:31:30.206
MARISHA: (whispering) Sign me up for the champ.

1945
01:31:31.475 --> 01:31:35.066
TRAVIS: Is there a possibility of
having two champion bouts?

1946
01:31:36.416 --> 01:31:39.225
MATT: "I think the champion's only
around for one fight.

1947
01:31:39.225 --> 01:31:41.511
"That's a bit tough of an ask, that one."

1948
01:31:41.511 --> 01:31:43.261
TRAVIS: Of course, pigeons.

1949
01:31:44.770 --> 01:31:46.353
ASHLEY: Oh, I feel like...

1950
01:31:47.785 --> 01:31:49.659
You know what?

1951
01:31:49.659 --> 01:31:52.967
I feel like Beau would
want a champion, maybe we--

1952
01:31:54.042 --> 01:31:56.624
maybe we get this for her, you know?

1953
01:31:56.624 --> 01:31:58.574
And then I can just fight--

1954
01:31:58.574 --> 01:31:59.743
TRAVIS: Standard?

1955
01:31:59.743 --> 01:32:00.576
ASHLEY: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Sure.

1956
01:32:00.576 --> 01:32:03.562
MATT: "Do you want to take on
the champion for the steel then?"

1957
01:32:03.562 --> 01:32:05.200
LAURA: Ooh, do that!

1958
01:32:05.200 --> 01:32:07.152
MARISHA: Do that, do it.
Do it, bitch.

1959
01:32:07.152 --> 01:32:08.964
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1960
01:32:08.964 --> 01:32:10.975
LAURA: Well, that's 600 gold.

1961
01:32:10.975 --> 01:32:11.808
ASHLEY: Yeah.

1962
01:32:12.694 --> 01:32:14.544
Oh, it's tempting.

1963
01:32:14.544 --> 01:32:17.507
TRAVIS: You got a lot of shit, you got rage.

1964
01:32:17.507 --> 01:32:19.947
ASHLEY: Oh, yeah, I can use all that.

1965
01:32:19.947 --> 01:32:21.316
MATT: "It's up to you."

1966
01:32:21.316 --> 01:32:25.533
TRAVIS: But remember, it's whatever
technique, only some damage

1967
01:32:25.533 --> 01:32:28.391
is halved and if they come
in with that other shit.

1968
01:32:30.716 --> 01:32:32.115
It's up to you.

1969
01:32:32.115 --> 01:32:33.967
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm going to go with it.

1970
01:32:33.967 --> 01:32:37.050
I'm going to stay with what I asked for.

1971
01:32:37.895 --> 01:32:40.490
I'm fighting the champion.
ASHLEY: Unarmed champion.

1972
01:32:40.490 --> 01:32:42.899
MATT: "Unarmed champion.

1973
01:32:42.899 --> 01:32:44.861
"Unarmed standard.

1974
01:32:44.861 --> 01:32:49.157
"And you, steel, standard.

1975
01:32:49.157 --> 01:32:52.492
"All right, 200 gold, 275
from you for both of those."

1976
01:32:52.492 --> 01:32:53.325
TRAVIS: Got it.

1977
01:32:54.389 --> 01:32:55.429
MATT: "Pay it up."

1978
01:32:55.429 --> 01:32:57.595
MARISHA: I reimburse you.
TRAVIS: Thank you.

1979
01:32:57.595 --> 01:32:59.715
MATT: "No more entries.

1980
01:32:59.715 --> 01:33:02.444
"Should be able to lock
this down by tomorrow night.

1981
01:33:02.444 --> 01:33:04.776
"I'd say check in tomorrow
midday just to confirm

1982
01:33:04.776 --> 01:33:07.923
"in case one of them is
busy and can't make it."

1983
01:33:07.923 --> 01:33:10.118
TRAVIS: Is there something else
that we should mention

1984
01:33:10.118 --> 01:33:13.801
as a token of our agreement
other than Stone's Coffin?

1985
01:33:14.701 --> 01:33:15.842
Stone Coffin?

1986
01:33:16.918 --> 01:33:19.040
MATT: "Well, what do you mean?"

1987
01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:20.308
TRAVIS: I don't know, like a code word.

1988
01:33:20.308 --> 01:33:23.933
Something to keep it fun and lively,
like chicken wax.

1989
01:33:23.933 --> 01:33:26.648
MATT: "Well, wait till about this time
when I close tomorrow.

1990
01:33:26.648 --> 01:33:27.565
"Come on by.

1991
01:33:28.411 --> 01:33:33.411
"Say you're in for that special cut
that I put aside for you."

1992
01:33:33.910 --> 01:33:36.040
TRAVIS: Special cut?
ASHLEY: Special cut you put aside.

1993
01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:39.120
TRAVIS: Yeah, that moist brisket.

1994
01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:41.979
That lean tri tip.

1995
01:33:41.979 --> 01:33:45.014
MATT: "Are you making fun of me?"
TRAVIS: No, no, I'm not.

1996
01:33:45.014 --> 01:33:47.116
ASHLEY: He was just going through,
he knows all the meat cuts.

1997
01:33:47.116 --> 01:33:49.388
TRAVIS: Trying to put a little flavor to it.

1998
01:33:49.388 --> 01:33:50.999
TALIESIN: That was a question recently.

1999
01:33:50.999 --> 01:33:52.866
MATT: "Good meat joke, I like it."

2000
01:33:52.866 --> 01:33:55.319
ASHLEY: We'll be back this time tomorrow, then,

2001
01:33:55.319 --> 01:33:56.967
and we'll have some fun.

2002
01:33:56.967 --> 01:33:58.166
MATT: All right."

2003
01:33:58.166 --> 01:34:00.735
LAURA: While they've been in the office,

2004
01:34:00.735 --> 01:34:03.465
I've been using my special paint

2005
01:34:03.465 --> 01:34:07.476
and just painting googly eyes
on the boar's heads

2006
01:34:07.476 --> 01:34:11.052
that I'm assuming that are out the dead pigs

2007
01:34:11.052 --> 01:34:15.695
and any animals I just want to
paint the googly eyes on them

2008
01:34:15.695 --> 01:34:17.457
with the special paint so that they turn

2009
01:34:17.457 --> 01:34:20.617
into real googly eyes.
MATT: Yeah, it's grotesque.

2010
01:34:21.934 --> 01:34:24.204
(chuckles) You painted cartoony and you back away

2011
01:34:24.204 --> 01:34:28.472
and slowly they go, (slurps) and become actual bulging

2012
01:34:28.472 --> 01:34:32.563
white eyes going like, sticking out of these--

2013
01:34:32.563 --> 01:34:33.788
LAURA: Oh!

2014
01:34:35.363 --> 01:34:39.932
MATT: Terrible open, organ-less pig corpses.

2015
01:34:39.932 --> 01:34:41.599
LAURA: This is fucked up.

2016
01:34:43.218 --> 01:34:45.841
I was picturing way more like plasticky-looking,

2017
01:34:45.841 --> 01:34:49.483
but oh, this is fucked up.
SAM: Real eyes on a dead pig.

2018
01:34:51.264 --> 01:34:52.999
TALIESIN: No.
LAURA: No, no.

2019
01:34:52.999 --> 01:34:55.663
MATT: "Well, I've got to close up,
see you tomorrow."

2020
01:34:55.663 --> 01:34:58.583
ASHLEY: All right, thank you, Jacquel.

2021
01:34:58.583 --> 01:34:59.961
MATT: "What's your name, by the way?"

2022
01:34:59.961 --> 01:35:01.255
ASHLEY: My name is Yasha.

2023
01:35:01.255 --> 01:35:03.073
MATT: "Yasha, you are?"
TRAVIS: Fjord.

2024
01:35:03.073 --> 01:35:06.262
MATT: "Fjord, and who's your third compatriot coming?"

2025
01:35:06.262 --> 01:35:08.895
TRAVIS: That will be Beau, Beauregard.

2026
01:35:08.895 --> 01:35:11.895
MATT: "All right, where do you hail from?"

2027
01:35:13.644 --> 01:35:15.061
ASHLEY: Oh, well, uh...

2028
01:35:15.895 --> 01:35:17.903
TRAVIS: Port Damali for me.

2029
01:35:17.903 --> 01:35:20.071
MATT: "Doesn't have to be accurate,

2030
01:35:20.071 --> 01:35:24.154
"I just got to have something
to announce you with."

2031
01:35:25.431 --> 01:35:26.514
ASHLEY: From, uh...

2032
01:35:28.153 --> 01:35:29.423
From Xhorhas.

2033
01:35:29.423 --> 01:35:31.481
MATT: "Ah, good cover.

2034
01:35:31.481 --> 01:35:34.481
"You, the other one, the other one?"

2035
01:35:36.284 --> 01:35:38.657
TRAVIS: Where the fuck would Beau be from?

2036
01:35:38.657 --> 01:35:41.333
ASHLEY: I think she said she's from Hupperdook.

2037
01:35:41.333 --> 01:35:43.252
TRAVIS: Upper Duke, Upper Duke?

2038
01:35:43.252 --> 01:35:44.875
Upper-- Upper Hupper?

2039
01:35:44.875 --> 01:35:46.431
LAURA: Up Hup.
TRAVIS: Up Hup.

2040
01:35:46.431 --> 01:35:48.202
ASHLEY: Up Hup Hup.
TRAVIS: Up Hup.

2041
01:35:48.202 --> 01:35:50.714
MATT: "From Up Hup?"
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2042
01:35:50.714 --> 01:35:51.547
MATT: Makes a note.

2043
01:35:51.547 --> 01:35:53.822
TRAVIS: Started Down Dook, went Up Hup.

2044
01:35:56.690 --> 01:36:00.182
MATT: "All right, filter out,
I'll see you tomorrow."

2045
01:36:00.182 --> 01:36:02.361
Leads you out, steps outside.

2046
01:36:02.361 --> 01:36:04.499
You guys watch as they emerge from the office.

2047
01:36:04.499 --> 01:36:07.249
She's like, I've got a crew here.

2048
01:36:08.350 --> 01:36:11.708
We finished our business, purchase is made.

2049
01:36:11.708 --> 01:36:13.110
Your meat will be ready tomorrow.

2050
01:36:13.110 --> 01:36:16.480
TRAVIS: Yep, meat will be ready tomorrow.

2051
01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:18.352
LAURA: (chuckles)

2052
01:36:18.352 --> 01:36:20.592
SAM: Thank you.
LAURA: Thank you, good night.

2053
01:36:20.592 --> 01:36:24.392
MATT: "Good night," pushes you out,
closes, locks it up.

2054
01:36:24.392 --> 01:36:27.374
TRAVIS: That was a complete success.
We have three fights.

2055
01:36:27.374 --> 01:36:28.609
LAURA: I just listen to see if she--

2056
01:36:28.609 --> 01:36:29.769
MATT: (muffled) "What the fuck!"

2057
01:36:29.769 --> 01:36:32.025
LAURA: (laughs) Run away!

2058
01:36:32.025 --> 01:36:32.858
SAM: Let's go!

2059
01:36:32.858 --> 01:36:33.772
MATT: You guys go charging into the night.

2060
01:36:33.772 --> 01:36:36.812
TRAVIS: What'd you do, what'd you do, what'd you do?

2061
01:36:36.812 --> 01:36:37.802
So we have three fights.

2062
01:36:37.802 --> 01:36:40.749
Yasha's going to fight unarmed, with their champion.

2063
01:36:40.749 --> 01:36:41.826
LAURA: Ooh!

2064
01:36:41.826 --> 01:36:45.155
TRAVIS: I signed you up for some bare bones standard fare.

2065
01:36:45.155 --> 01:36:46.921
MARISHA: Fuck yeah, you know me so well.

2066
01:36:46.921 --> 01:36:49.603
TRAVIS: And then I had to use a sword,
because let's be fair,

2067
01:36:49.603 --> 01:36:50.630
I'm not really that--

2068
01:36:50.630 --> 01:36:52.623
SAM: You're very puny.
LAURA: You're very strong, no!

2069
01:36:52.623 --> 01:36:54.350
He's not, he's not puny anymore!

2070
01:36:54.350 --> 01:36:57.084
Look at how strong he is, and I poke on his muscles.

2071
01:36:57.084 --> 01:36:58.550
MARISHA: We've been working this shit.

2072
01:36:58.550 --> 01:37:00.426
SAM: I know, but you can't--

2073
01:37:00.426 --> 01:37:01.954
LAURA: I saw, I saw!

2074
01:37:01.954 --> 01:37:03.711
His pec just moved.
TRAVIS: Yeah, they move.

2075
01:37:03.711 --> 01:37:06.290
LAURA: (gasps) Nott, his pecs moved.

2076
01:37:06.290 --> 01:37:08.919
SAM: I understand that, but he's still gangly

2077
01:37:08.919 --> 01:37:11.478
and every time he picks up the sword

2078
01:37:11.478 --> 01:37:13.683
I hear his wrist crack a little bit.

2079
01:37:13.683 --> 01:37:16.595
TALIESIN: I thought that was just dramatic wind.

2080
01:37:16.595 --> 01:37:18.365
TRAVIS: No, it's the push ups.

2081
01:37:18.365 --> 01:37:19.914
MARISHA: Just a little tendonitis.

2082
01:37:19.914 --> 01:37:21.455
That's nothing, don't worry about that.

2083
01:37:21.455 --> 01:37:23.090
SAM: It's like a tennis elbow.

2084
01:37:23.090 --> 01:37:25.134
TRAVIS: Build your pectoral muscles.

2085
01:37:25.134 --> 01:37:27.505
LAURA: Do it again, do it again, do it again.

2086
01:37:27.505 --> 01:37:29.997
Oh! (giggles)

2087
01:37:29.997 --> 01:37:31.949
SAM: You can do that!

2088
01:37:31.949 --> 01:37:35.297
Your little weasel moves every once in a while.

2089
01:37:35.297 --> 01:37:36.166
TRAVIS: (as Sprinkle) Kill me!

2090
01:37:36.166 --> 01:37:39.434
(laughter)

2091
01:37:39.434 --> 01:37:42.746
MATT: You have some pecs on you. You can probably do that.

2092
01:37:42.746 --> 01:37:44.885
SAM: Yep, your weasel's moving around in there!

2093
01:37:44.885 --> 01:37:47.415
(laughter)

2094
01:37:47.415 --> 01:37:50.117
Let's throw some bacon down your shirt.

2095
01:37:50.117 --> 01:37:51.617
LAURA: Oh, he likes it.

2096
01:37:54.653 --> 01:37:55.486
MATT: All right.

2097
01:37:55.486 --> 01:37:56.879
SAM: All right, let's go home and go to sleep.

2098
01:37:56.879 --> 01:37:59.279
It's late, come on.

2099
01:37:59.279 --> 01:38:00.911
MATT: All right, you guys get back. It's a little bit past

2100
01:38:00.911 --> 01:38:04.099
midnight after all the traveling and checking things out

2101
01:38:04.099 --> 01:38:06.530
and making this whole thing work out,

2102
01:38:06.530 --> 01:38:10.490
situated for tomorrow night's whatever this is going to be,

2103
01:38:10.490 --> 01:38:11.730
you found a fight pit.

2104
01:38:11.730 --> 01:38:12.563
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

2105
01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:17.510
MATT: You finish your evening's research.

2106
01:38:17.510 --> 01:38:21.071
LIAM: As soon as they left, 20 minutes after they left,

2107
01:38:21.071 --> 01:38:23.238
Caleb went up to his room,

2108
01:38:24.402 --> 01:38:26.450
can I use that home brew to do something super simple here?

2109
01:38:26.450 --> 01:38:28.610
SAM: Masturbated, yes.

2110
01:38:28.610 --> 01:38:32.493
LIAM: So Caleb goes up to his room

2111
01:38:32.493 --> 01:38:35.683
and places, um, five pieces of--

2112
01:38:35.683 --> 01:38:38.341
MATT: Silver thread everywhere.

2113
01:38:38.341 --> 01:38:42.861
LIAM: Five pieces of amber on the floor,
after he masturbates,

2114
01:38:42.861 --> 01:38:47.861
and takes his holster with the books on it off

2115
01:38:48.261 --> 01:38:51.008
and places the entire set of holsters and books

2116
01:38:51.008 --> 01:38:54.320
into the center of this circle of five amber pieces

2117
01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:57.048
and mutters a few words and starts to trace his fingers

2118
01:38:57.048 --> 01:39:01.328
through the air and casts Widogast's Vault of Amber.

2119
01:39:01.328 --> 01:39:06.328
And the harnesses and the books just (inhales sharply)

2120
01:39:06.992 --> 01:39:11.020
shrink in and a little beam of light burns along the floor

2121
01:39:11.020 --> 01:39:13.083
towards the piece of amber closest to Caleb

2122
01:39:13.083 --> 01:39:16.352
and they are gone and he collects up the pieces,

2123
01:39:16.352 --> 01:39:19.792
the largest one and puts them away into his bag

2124
01:39:19.792 --> 01:39:23.608
and sets off for the Shimmer Ward.

2125
01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:26.810
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: To find her house.

2126
01:39:28.531 --> 01:39:29.531
MATT: All right.

2127
01:39:30.821 --> 01:39:31.654
So.

2128
01:39:35.912 --> 01:39:37.495
TRAVIS: (quietly) Oh, shit, forgot.

2129
01:39:38.629 --> 01:39:43.347
MATT: Situated in the northeastern
reaches of the Shimmer Ward,

2130
01:39:43.347 --> 01:39:47.576
you come upon the address stated in the letter.

2131
01:39:47.576 --> 01:39:49.409
31st Wodestone Manor.

2132
01:39:50.517 --> 01:39:53.517
A respectable manner house rests on an expansive property

2133
01:39:53.517 --> 01:39:56.096
that seems to bear numerous other abodes,

2134
01:39:56.096 --> 01:39:58.864
across its sneaking grasses and fencing.

2135
01:39:58.864 --> 01:40:00.944
All which wrap around and sit in the shadow

2136
01:40:00.944 --> 01:40:05.944
of one of the ominous towers of the Candles, a familiar one.

2137
01:40:07.577 --> 01:40:10.097
Her manor house is one of many that sit on a property

2138
01:40:10.097 --> 01:40:13.180
that encircles Trent Ikithon's tower.

2139
01:40:16.404 --> 01:40:18.214
You can see the manor house is largely built from

2140
01:40:18.214 --> 01:40:20.246
bleached pale wood and dark window frames,

2141
01:40:20.246 --> 01:40:23.177
making for a curious contrast. It looks very nice.

2142
01:40:23.177 --> 01:40:25.355
LIAM: How many stories is it?

2143
01:40:25.355 --> 01:40:28.475
MATT: This home is one and a half.

2144
01:40:28.475 --> 01:40:30.406
The second story is, I mean, it's two stories,

2145
01:40:30.406 --> 01:40:32.833
but it's not like a major building, it's like a smaller,

2146
01:40:32.833 --> 01:40:34.515
additional room, maybe.

2147
01:40:34.515 --> 01:40:35.921
It's nice, but it's not as big as some

2148
01:40:35.921 --> 01:40:38.761
of the other estates you've seen here.

2149
01:40:38.761 --> 01:40:40.889
But at this point and time for you,

2150
01:40:40.889 --> 01:40:45.339
I'd say it's past sunset, so it's evening.

2151
01:40:45.339 --> 01:40:48.498
Some of the lanterns in the district are lit.

2152
01:40:48.498 --> 01:40:49.453
Some folk are walking through,

2153
01:40:49.453 --> 01:40:53.112
but most of the Shimmer Ward has died down.

2154
01:40:53.112 --> 01:40:54.573
LIAM: Is it lit?

2155
01:40:54.573 --> 01:40:56.406
MATT: The interior is lit.

2156
01:40:58.742 --> 01:41:00.159
LIAM: Well, he, um...

2157
01:41:01.235 --> 01:41:05.048
Stands in the street for 10 minutes, thereabouts,

2158
01:41:05.048 --> 01:41:08.807
and just stares at the tower and

2159
01:41:10.053 --> 01:41:14.970
finally works up the courage and approaches the front door.

2160
01:41:16.104 --> 01:41:18.637
If there is anything to knock?

2161
01:41:18.637 --> 01:41:20.317
MATT: There is a knocker, a little iron knocker.

2162
01:41:20.317 --> 01:41:21.886
LIAM: Yeah.

2163
01:41:21.886 --> 01:41:23.969
(knocks)

2164
01:41:25.446 --> 01:41:28.757
MATT: A few moments pass before the door. (mimics creaking)

2165
01:41:28.757 --> 01:41:31.273
You see a male halfling

2166
01:41:31.273 --> 01:41:34.848
in a nice formal-looking suit,

2167
01:41:36.375 --> 01:41:41.226
hair pulled back in a loose pony tail, dark hair,

2168
01:41:41.226 --> 01:41:45.726
looks kind of young, opens and goes, "Might I help you?"

2169
01:41:46.685 --> 01:41:50.518
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, I'm here to see the lady of the house.

2170
01:41:52.056 --> 01:41:53.973
MATT: "And who might you be?"

2171
01:41:55.465 --> 01:41:58.382
LIAM: My name is Bren Aldric Ermendrud.

2172
01:41:59.333 --> 01:42:03.583
MATT: "I'll pass this on to the lady. Please be patient."

2173
01:42:08.104 --> 01:42:11.721
SAM: (whispering) Bren Aldric Ermendrud.

2174
01:42:14.656 --> 01:42:16.696
MATT: "The lady will see you shortly.

2175
01:42:16.696 --> 01:42:18.685
"If you would please step in.

2176
01:42:18.685 --> 01:42:21.794
"There is a guest holding chamber.

2177
01:42:21.794 --> 01:42:23.474
"If you wouldn't mind waiting for a moment?"

2178
01:42:23.474 --> 01:42:25.834
LIAM: Of course.
MATT: "Of course."

2179
01:42:25.834 --> 01:42:27.417
As you step inside,

2180
01:42:29.974 --> 01:42:33.679
the hosting chambers is this very sparsely decorated room.

2181
01:42:33.679 --> 01:42:35.680
The interior, while the exterior looks very nice,

2182
01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:38.449
the interior's very minimalistic.

2183
01:42:38.449 --> 01:42:40.720
You've seen a lot of garish homes from the inside

2184
01:42:40.720 --> 01:42:43.309
of a lot of affluent folk that're just filled with decor

2185
01:42:43.309 --> 01:42:45.911
and paintings and it's very much a display.

2186
01:42:45.911 --> 01:42:48.871
This house, a lot of the rooms just feel more empty,

2187
01:42:48.871 --> 01:42:52.000
but not in a way that feels like it's unintentional.

2188
01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:55.302
It's just very, everything is particularly placed

2189
01:42:55.302 --> 01:42:59.802
and spacious and this hosting chamber is no different.

2190
01:43:01.262 --> 01:43:05.179
Small table under the window, those two couches

2191
01:43:06.382 --> 01:43:08.001
Not much else, the walls are pretty barren here.

2192
01:43:08.001 --> 01:43:10.811
But you're brought to the seat, and what you gather now

2193
01:43:10.811 --> 01:43:14.561
is probably the servant of the manor exits.

2194
01:43:16.992 --> 01:43:21.371
LIAM: I sit absolutely stock still and don't move a muscle.

2195
01:43:21.371 --> 01:43:23.752
MATT: You can feel your heart
beat throughout your whole body

2196
01:43:23.752 --> 01:43:28.752
just (mimics beating) your entire chest is

2197
01:43:28.779 --> 01:43:31.057
hot and swelling with the nerves that are

2198
01:43:31.057 --> 01:43:33.057
curling in your stomach.

2199
01:43:35.804 --> 01:43:38.887
You begin to hear footsteps approach.

2200
01:43:41.337 --> 01:43:45.537
The archway that leads into the hosting chamber,

2201
01:43:45.537 --> 01:43:50.095
a figure steps in and raises a hand

2202
01:43:50.095 --> 01:43:53.846
and the low candle light in the room gets brighter

2203
01:43:53.846 --> 01:43:56.434
to lighten the interior

2204
01:43:56.434 --> 01:44:01.265
and you see a human woman in her mid 30s,

2205
01:44:01.265 --> 01:44:04.337
dirty blonde hair, extremely short in the back,

2206
01:44:04.337 --> 01:44:07.563
but long and side-combed in the front,

2207
01:44:07.563 --> 01:44:12.563
framing the right side of her face to just past the chin.

2208
01:44:12.661 --> 01:44:16.987
She looks over towards you, a familiar face of older

2209
01:44:16.987 --> 01:44:21.595
with a hard look in her eyes, but a smile,

2210
01:44:22.779 --> 01:44:25.616
with a heavy scar that is new,

2211
01:44:25.616 --> 01:44:27.567
that rides from the top of the brow

2212
01:44:27.567 --> 01:44:30.453
down to the bottom of the chin.

2213
01:44:30.453 --> 01:44:31.896
She's dressed simply.

2214
01:44:31.896 --> 01:44:32.729
LIAM: I rise.

2215
01:44:38.645 --> 01:44:40.645
MATT: (German accent) "It has been some time.

2216
01:44:41.893 --> 01:44:43.726
"I was not expecting...

2217
01:44:44.652 --> 01:44:45.983
"You.

2218
01:44:45.983 --> 01:44:46.816
"Bren."

2219
01:44:51.055 --> 01:44:54.055
LIAM: (American accent) Let's speak in our regular tongue.

2220
01:44:55.695 --> 01:44:57.778
MATT: She responds in Zemnian.

2221
01:44:59.535 --> 01:45:00.785
(American accent) "Of course."

2222
01:45:03.443 --> 01:45:04.276
LIAM: Hi.

2223
01:45:05.415 --> 01:45:06.681
MATT: "Hello."

2224
01:45:16.306 --> 01:45:21.139
LIAM: I think I've been imagining
and dreading this moment for

2225
01:45:24.412 --> 01:45:27.241
longer than I care to admit.

2226
01:45:27.241 --> 01:45:28.074
MATT: "Hm.

2227
01:45:30.543 --> 01:45:33.376
"I'm sorry dread was a word, but...

2228
01:45:35.762 --> 01:45:38.345
"I'm sure you have your reasons."

2229
01:45:49.972 --> 01:45:51.980
LIAM: There's so many things that I--

2230
01:45:51.980 --> 01:45:52.813
MATT: "Sit.

2231
01:45:54.368 --> 01:45:55.201
"Sit."

2232
01:45:57.758 --> 01:46:02.758
She steps across the room to meet you on the opposite couch

2233
01:46:02.926 --> 01:46:05.464
and sits and rolls her sleeves up on her blouse

2234
01:46:05.464 --> 01:46:10.464
where you can see the same marked maze-like tattoos

2235
01:46:10.846 --> 01:46:14.429
that you have previously seen on Eodwulf's--

2236
01:46:15.606 --> 01:46:18.758
or the arms of the halfling that was next to him.

2237
01:46:18.758 --> 01:46:20.396
LIAM: What color are they?

2238
01:46:20.396 --> 01:46:23.785
MATT: They appear to be black.
LIAM: Okay.

2239
01:46:23.785 --> 01:46:26.183
MATT: She sits down, pulls them up a bit,

2240
01:46:26.183 --> 01:46:31.100
crosses her hands across her knee and sits across from you.

2241
01:46:36.156 --> 01:46:37.156
LIAM: So much...

2242
01:46:40.556 --> 01:46:41.723
What happened?

2243
01:46:46.225 --> 01:46:49.392
MATT: "A lot of things have happened, Bren.

2244
01:46:50.777 --> 01:46:53.527
"Where would you like me to begin?"

2245
01:46:59.266 --> 01:47:02.516
LIAM: The last thing I remember is my home.

2246
01:47:04.428 --> 01:47:07.095
(Astrid sighs)

2247
01:47:17.226 --> 01:47:18.059
MATT: "We're...

2248
01:47:20.580 --> 01:47:22.764
"Chosen for a reason.

2249
01:47:25.628 --> 01:47:30.037
"From obscurity picked from the rest of the riffraff

2250
01:47:30.037 --> 01:47:34.196
"for something that we <i>can</i> do.

2251
01:47:40.820 --> 01:47:41.653
"And to...

2252
01:47:44.238 --> 01:47:46.155
"Seize such a destiny...

2253
01:47:50.226 --> 01:47:52.643
"Can cause a lot of heartache.

2254
01:47:58.137 --> 01:48:01.054
"And we can do some terrible things."

2255
01:48:13.068 --> 01:48:16.985
LIAM: It's strange, I find myself wanting to, um...

2256
01:48:18.777 --> 01:48:20.268
Apologize.

2257
01:48:23.809 --> 01:48:24.642
Still...

2258
01:48:26.578 --> 01:48:28.828
So much of me feels like...

2259
01:48:31.859 --> 01:48:33.759
I failed.

2260
01:48:37.620 --> 01:48:38.453
But...

2261
01:48:41.830 --> 01:48:43.330
A lot has changed.

2262
01:48:47.009 --> 01:48:50.342
And I know some things now that I didn't

2263
01:48:51.881 --> 01:48:53.048
as a boy, and,

2264
01:48:56.649 --> 01:48:59.408
I am so glad to see you.

2265
01:48:59.408 --> 01:49:00.798
(Astrid chuckles)

2266
01:49:00.798 --> 01:49:03.465
MATT: "I'm glad to see you too, Bren.

2267
01:49:06.777 --> 01:49:10.444
"I mean, it's been well over a decade that...

2268
01:49:11.744 --> 01:49:14.882
"And still often I've talked about

2269
01:49:14.882 --> 01:49:18.715
"and wondered where you were, if you were okay."

2270
01:49:21.896 --> 01:49:25.813
LIAM: How did I... (clears throat)

2271
01:49:26.873 --> 01:49:28.623
He's in a cold sweat.

2272
01:49:30.602 --> 01:49:33.269
How did I get to the Sanatorium?

2273
01:49:36.234 --> 01:49:37.901
MATT: "We took you there.

2274
01:49:40.234 --> 01:49:42.234
"You had a breaking point

2275
01:49:44.442 --> 01:49:47.542
"and understandably...

2276
01:49:49.322 --> 01:49:50.822
"Began to lash out.

2277
01:49:53.834 --> 01:49:58.834
"Part of that same spark that was seen in you

2278
01:49:59.125 --> 01:50:00.875
"could create a lot of

2279
01:50:02.373 --> 01:50:05.348
"sparks everywhere else."

2280
01:50:08.674 --> 01:50:11.725
And you see she reaches up and scratches a bit and you

2281
01:50:11.725 --> 01:50:16.475
can see there's burn scars on the side of her neck there.

2282
01:50:20.536 --> 01:50:22.369
"But for your own good.

2283
01:50:25.016 --> 01:50:27.083
"We took care of you.

2284
01:50:27.083 --> 01:50:29.166
"And we brought you there.

2285
01:50:30.474 --> 01:50:33.874
"But we had to subdue you first.

2286
01:50:33.874 --> 01:50:37.624
"You were too dangerous to us and to yourself."

2287
01:50:45.754 --> 01:50:47.921
LIAM: I was there a long time.

2288
01:50:50.034 --> 01:50:52.951
MATT: "And we always hoped that you'd...

2289
01:50:55.906 --> 01:50:59.906
"That you'd improve, and at times you did, and...

2290
01:51:01.657 --> 01:51:06.242
"I mean, to be honest, even looking at you now and

2291
01:51:06.242 --> 01:51:10.242
"hearing some of the things that you are doing...

2292
01:51:13.969 --> 01:51:17.551
"I mean, you've defied all of our expectations.

2293
01:51:17.551 --> 01:51:20.952
"And if you feel like you've failed then,

2294
01:51:20.952 --> 01:51:25.902
"know that everyone's path goes at different paces.

2295
01:51:27.710 --> 01:51:29.802
"You've certainly proven now that you are in

2296
01:51:29.802 --> 01:51:31.969
"no way or shape a failure."

2297
01:51:36.602 --> 01:51:39.269
LIAM: What are you doing these days?

2298
01:51:41.904 --> 01:51:45.287
MATT: "I'm doing a bit of tutelage.

2299
01:51:46.962 --> 01:51:48.520
"I'm...

2300
01:51:51.482 --> 01:51:54.065
"Doing what we were meant to do,

2301
01:51:55.162 --> 01:51:58.770
"which is keep our people safe."

2302
01:52:03.271 --> 01:52:05.341
LIAM: Is it difficult for you?

2303
01:52:05.341 --> 01:52:07.569
MATT: "At times.

2304
01:52:07.569 --> 01:52:09.902
"But I take pride in my work.

2305
01:52:12.210 --> 01:52:16.627
"And I've stopped some terrible things from happening.

2306
01:52:17.821 --> 01:52:21.238
"And I have seen some of the possibilities

2307
01:52:24.330 --> 01:52:26.163
"of what can be done...

2308
01:52:29.340 --> 01:52:33.340
"With the right application with the right minds."

2309
01:52:41.161 --> 01:52:42.494
LIAM: Had you heard,

2310
01:52:43.529 --> 01:52:44.529
that my, uh,

2311
01:52:45.998 --> 01:52:47.998
friends and I were here?

2312
01:52:49.449 --> 01:52:54.390
MATT: "And it was rather rapid chatter once

2313
01:52:54.390 --> 01:52:59.349
"Trent had notified us of the return of a lost pup."

2314
01:53:01.618 --> 01:53:02.951
LIAM: You know what

2315
01:53:04.789 --> 01:53:08.122
the Mighty Nein and I are leaving to do?

2316
01:53:09.197 --> 01:53:13.763
MATT: "I've heard and I'm very curious. It seems...

2317
01:53:15.464 --> 01:53:19.732
"I mean, it seems so not what
I would have expected from you.

2318
01:53:19.732 --> 01:53:21.648
"So much more.

2319
01:53:22.643 --> 01:53:24.726
"I'm impressed, I'm proud."

2320
01:53:31.475 --> 01:53:32.725
LIAM: When I, um...

2321
01:53:34.834 --> 01:53:36.501
Came back to myself,

2322
01:53:38.533 --> 01:53:39.533
in Vergessen,

2323
01:53:42.931 --> 01:53:45.481
there was a woman.

2324
01:53:47.801 --> 01:53:50.201
A patient, I think.

2325
01:53:56.491 --> 01:53:58.625
She healed me?

2326
01:53:59.993 --> 01:54:00.826
And...

2327
01:54:02.979 --> 01:54:06.252
This might be hard for me to convince you,

2328
01:54:06.252 --> 01:54:08.669
but she helped me see things.

2329
01:54:13.359 --> 01:54:15.442
What we did that night...

2330
01:54:19.602 --> 01:54:20.519
I did fail.

2331
01:54:24.703 --> 01:54:27.120
But I didn't fail the empire.

2332
01:54:29.551 --> 01:54:32.968
I failed myself and my mother and father.

2333
01:54:39.623 --> 01:54:40.456
He...

2334
01:54:41.612 --> 01:54:42.445
Lied...

2335
01:54:43.972 --> 01:54:45.447
To me.

2336
01:54:48.772 --> 01:54:51.022
I know he lied.

2337
01:54:55.852 --> 01:54:58.935
And if he would lie to me about that,

2338
01:55:01.914 --> 01:55:06.831
it is hard for me to understand what he wouldn't lie about.

2339
01:55:09.732 --> 01:55:12.399
(Astrid sighs)

2340
01:55:13.543 --> 01:55:14.376
MATT: "Bren.

2341
01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:17.203
"I'm so sorry.

2342
01:55:22.640 --> 01:55:26.131
"(sighs) I'm so sorry."

2343
01:55:26.131 --> 01:55:29.818
She reaches out and touches your cheek.

2344
01:55:29.818 --> 01:55:31.266
LIAM: Insight check.

2345
01:55:31.266 --> 01:55:33.127
MATT: Insight check.
LAURA: Oh, god!

2346
01:55:33.127 --> 01:55:34.962
MARISHA: No, no.
LAURA: She's evil.

2347
01:55:34.962 --> 01:55:37.171
SAM: It's a good insight check.

2348
01:55:37.171 --> 01:55:40.453
Good roll, good insight check.

2349
01:55:40.453 --> 01:55:41.286
LIAM: 27.

2350
01:55:42.501 --> 01:55:44.073
MATT: Well, since everybody else is at this table,

2351
01:55:44.073 --> 01:55:46.656
I don't have to whisper to you.

2352
01:55:48.852 --> 01:55:53.844
She seems very genuinely mournful for your pain

2353
01:55:55.084 --> 01:55:56.667
and your suffering,

2354
01:55:58.332 --> 01:56:00.492
but there's also a hardness to it

2355
01:56:00.492 --> 01:56:05.492
like a less this was a terrible thing that happened.

2356
01:56:05.604 --> 01:56:10.296
This is more a I'm sorry you suffered,

2357
01:56:10.296 --> 01:56:14.544
as we've suffered, as many people have suffered for

2358
01:56:16.031 --> 01:56:17.428
ever and ever.

2359
01:56:17.428 --> 01:56:18.928
Life is suffering.

2360
01:56:20.918 --> 01:56:23.418
And some things are necessary.

2361
01:56:25.108 --> 01:56:27.489
That's what you glean,

2362
01:56:27.489 --> 01:56:30.072
with a very high insight check.

2363
01:56:31.420 --> 01:56:33.253
SAM: Does she seem horny?

2364
01:56:34.121 --> 01:56:38.454
MATT: You're not there.
(laughter)

2365
01:56:43.987 --> 01:56:48.987
"To be gifted in a world filled with hardship like this

2366
01:56:49.037 --> 01:56:51.870
"is to do things we're not proud of

01:56:52.958 --> 01:56:56.358
"and to question the choices we make

01:56:56.358 --> 01:57:00.441

01:57:28.790 --> 01:57:30.957
"But I also know the reason

2376
01:57:32.020 --> 01:57:33.770
"that we get to sleep,

2377
01:57:35.797 --> 01:57:36.797
"every night,

2378
01:57:38.608 --> 01:57:40.691
"in a comfortable inn bed,

2379
01:57:42.521 --> 01:57:43.688
"or in a manor,

2380
01:57:44.817 --> 01:57:48.609
"as do the many families and children

2381
01:57:48.609 --> 01:57:50.109
"just like we were,

2382
01:57:51.090 --> 01:57:53.923
"just like the families we once had

2383
01:57:55.100 --> 01:57:57.940
"that don't have to make the choices we did.

2384
01:57:57.940 --> 01:58:00.350
"They still get to live,

2385
01:58:00.350 --> 01:58:02.350
"happily and comfortably,

2386
01:58:03.971 --> 01:58:06.638
"because the few, the chosen few,

2387
01:58:07.542 --> 01:58:09.292
"made the hard choice,

2388
01:58:11.128 --> 01:58:13.545
"and do what few have the will

2389
01:58:15.670 --> 01:58:16.503
"to do."

2390
01:58:36.443 --> 01:58:37.993
LIAM: I, um...

2391
01:58:41.963 --> 01:58:42.796
I'm sorry.

2392
01:58:47.232 --> 01:58:48.065
I will...

2393
01:58:51.331 --> 01:58:53.498
Never forget what we were.

2394
01:58:56.222 --> 01:58:57.055
And...

2395
01:58:58.519 --> 01:58:59.352
Even now,

2396
01:59:00.569 --> 01:59:02.402
all these years later,

2397
01:59:06.377 --> 01:59:08.544
I can't shake it, I still,

2398
01:59:11.103 --> 01:59:12.770
care a great deal...

2399
01:59:16.327 --> 01:59:17.760
About you.

2400
01:59:20.447 --> 01:59:21.364
At least...

2401
01:59:23.068 --> 01:59:24.401
The girl I knew.

2402
01:59:28.407 --> 01:59:29.240
But...

2403
01:59:34.714 --> 01:59:37.639
He has blinded you.

2404
01:59:39.727 --> 01:59:40.977
You and Wulf...

2405
01:59:44.493 --> 01:59:46.993
And all of his little helpers.

2406
01:59:50.035 --> 01:59:52.202
And I mourn our childhood,

2407
01:59:54.104 --> 01:59:55.271
and our souls.

2408
02:00:00.846 --> 02:00:04.596
MATT: She reaches up, puts her hand on your knee.

2409
02:00:09.664 --> 02:00:11.664
"I understand your anger.

2410
02:00:18.713 --> 02:00:20.130
"And as much as...

2411
02:00:23.121 --> 02:00:24.954
"He's been our teacher,

2412
02:00:27.418 --> 02:00:29.085
"he's not infallible.

2413
02:00:32.670 --> 02:00:35.062
"He's just an old man,

2414
02:00:36.860 --> 02:00:39.110
"with the right connections,

2415
02:00:40.828 --> 02:00:44.161
"who will one day pass, like they all do."

2416
02:00:50.529 --> 02:00:52.862
LIAM: You always were ambitious.

2417
02:00:59.908 --> 02:01:02.649
MATT: "So are you, apparently, Bren.

2418
02:01:02.649 --> 02:01:03.649
"Like I said.

2419
02:01:04.899 --> 02:01:06.316
"I'm proud of you."

2420
02:01:12.786 --> 02:01:14.703
LIAM: It's good to see you.

2421
02:01:16.326 --> 02:01:17.493
I think, um...

2422
02:01:19.049 --> 02:01:20.716
I think I better go.

2423
02:01:22.369 --> 02:01:25.452
I raise my hand slowly up and just...

2424
02:01:27.441 --> 02:01:28.691
Touch the scar.

2425
02:01:29.990 --> 02:01:31.740
Run my thumb down it.

2426
02:01:36.742 --> 02:01:38.467
Too many scars.

2427
02:01:42.051 --> 02:01:44.051
MATT: "I regret none of them.

2428
02:01:49.199 --> 02:01:50.599
"Except one."

2429
02:01:51.651 --> 02:01:54.068
LIAM: What was that?
MATT: "Except one."

2430
02:02:00.947 --> 02:02:04.530
LIAM: Thank you for allowing me into your home.

2431
02:02:06.439 --> 02:02:09.839
Maybe we will see each other again.

2432
02:02:10.821 --> 02:02:13.488
MATT: "You're welcome any time, Bren.

2433
02:02:15.621 --> 02:02:18.704
"I'd like to see more of you."

2434
02:02:21.509 --> 02:02:23.607
LIAM: Yeah, maybe...

2435
02:02:23.607 --> 02:02:25.940
And I speak in Common again.

2436
02:02:26.847 --> 02:02:28.772
(German accent) We'll see.

2437
02:02:30.477 --> 02:02:33.144
My friends are depending on me.

2438
02:02:33.144 --> 02:02:34.519
MATT: (German accent) "Of course.

2439
02:02:35.975 --> 02:02:38.258
"Then you should probably get to them."

2440
02:02:40.825 --> 02:02:43.791
LIAM: I'm just sort of hanging onto her face for a minute.

2441
02:02:45.733 --> 02:02:47.400
Think about staying.

2442
02:02:50.264 --> 02:02:53.006
And walk towards the door.

2443
02:02:55.646 --> 02:02:58.396
MATT: She gets up and follows behind.

2444
02:03:00.085 --> 02:03:01.168
At your pace.

2445
02:03:02.027 --> 02:03:06.344
Keeping her own distance from you

2446
02:03:06.344 --> 02:03:07.919
so as not to crowd.

2447
02:03:15.486 --> 02:03:17.519
LIAM: <i>Guten nacht.</i>

2448
02:03:18.544 --> 02:03:20.494
MATT: "<i>Guten nacht.</i>"

2449
02:03:20.494 --> 02:03:24.110
She grabs and squeezes your hand for a moment

2450
02:03:24.110 --> 02:03:27.257
before giving a nod to her servant who opens the front door.

2451
02:03:27.257 --> 02:03:30.185
(mimics creaking)

2452
02:03:30.185 --> 02:03:31.988
Releases it and just stands there,

2453
02:03:31.988 --> 02:03:35.807
arms crossed in front, watching you.

2454
02:03:35.807 --> 02:03:37.140
LIAM: I turn and go.

2455
02:03:39.727 --> 02:03:43.760
And I will wind my back to our lodgings.

2456
02:03:46.745 --> 02:03:48.516
MATT: And that's where we're going to take a break.

2457
02:03:48.516 --> 02:03:49.874
MARISHA: Oh, man.

2458
02:03:50.763 --> 02:03:54.430
TRAVIS: So many questions.
LAURA: I have so many questions.

2459
02:03:55.938 --> 02:03:58.399
I didn't trust a single word coming out of her mouth.

2460
02:03:58.399 --> 02:04:02.231
SAM: She was honest and she's just trying to,

2461
02:04:02.231 --> 02:04:03.865
I think she's just--
LAURA: One.

2462
02:04:03.865 --> 02:04:04.698
SAM: What?

2463
02:04:04.698 --> 02:04:06.464
LAURA: She's actually Trent Ikithon.

2464
02:04:06.464 --> 02:04:08.621
SAM: No.
LAURA: Two!

2465
02:04:08.621 --> 02:04:11.509
Trent Ikithon's upstairs. She'd just got done boning him,

2466
02:04:11.509 --> 02:04:12.837
and came downstairs to talk to you.

2467
02:04:12.837 --> 02:04:15.515
SAM: That could be.
MARISHA: He's hella old.

2468
02:04:15.515 --> 02:04:16.904
LAURA: Exactly.
SAM: She doesn't care.

2469
02:04:16.904 --> 02:04:18.404
She's brainwashed.

2470
02:04:19.395 --> 02:04:21.416
It's a harem, it's some sort of cult thing.

2471
02:04:21.416 --> 02:04:23.585
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, she thinks he's amazing.

2472
02:04:23.585 --> 02:04:24.710
TRAVIS: When you touched her face,

2473
02:04:24.710 --> 02:04:26.775
your hand connected with skin, right, not illusion?

2474
02:04:26.775 --> 02:04:28.984
LIAM: Well, he would've had to tell me.

2475
02:04:28.984 --> 02:04:32.210
MATT: Yeah, no, you felt--
LIAM: You feel feathers.

2476
02:04:32.210 --> 02:04:36.069
LAURA: Did it feel extra wrinkly compared to what you

2477
02:04:36.069 --> 02:04:38.318
were touching or was it way more wrinkly?

2478
02:04:38.318 --> 02:04:39.400
Was there stubble?

2479
02:04:39.400 --> 02:04:41.118
LIAM: Touch blows illusion spell,

2480
02:04:41.118 --> 02:04:43.278
so I would have had to feel something different than--

2481
02:04:43.278 --> 02:04:45.929
SAM: Yeah, but Trent Ikithon could know some crazy

2482
02:04:45.929 --> 02:04:48.550
dunamancy spell that overcomes that.

2483
02:04:48.550 --> 02:04:51.481
TALIESIN: What if he just really moisturizes a lot.

2484
02:04:51.481 --> 02:04:53.503
MATT: Summon Tova cream.

2485
02:04:53.503 --> 02:04:54.652
TALIESIN: Supple, beautiful skin.

2486
02:04:54.652 --> 02:04:56.433
TRAVIS: He's got Paul Newman face, just amazing.

2487
02:04:56.433 --> 02:04:58.506
TALIESIN: Oh, wow, good, good reference.

2488
02:04:58.506 --> 02:05:00.586
MATT: He's been moisturizing from the beginning.

2489
02:05:00.586 --> 02:05:02.324
LIAM: You can't un-Redford your face.

2490
02:05:02.324 --> 02:05:04.298
That's just...
(laughter)

2491
02:05:04.298 --> 02:05:05.987
ASHLEY: Why would you?
LIAM: Why would you?

2492
02:05:05.987 --> 02:05:07.571
Exactly.
MATT: Oh, man.

2493
02:05:07.571 --> 02:05:09.623
All righty, well, we're going to go ahead and take a break.

2494
02:05:09.623 --> 02:05:11.184
We'll be back here shortly, guys.

2495
02:05:11.184 --> 02:05:15.824
We do have our final giveaway of 2019.

2496
02:05:15.824 --> 02:05:18.921
We have the, god, this name always-- a padauk?

2497
02:05:18.921 --> 02:05:20.483
LAURA: Paddock?
SAM: Paduck?

2498
02:05:20.483 --> 02:05:23.373
MATT: I always end up pronouncing it 17 different ways

2499
02:05:23.373 --> 02:05:25.912
and then never remembering which one is the right one, so

2500
02:05:25.912 --> 02:05:29.192
this dice vault, this is actually one of my favorites,

2501

Oh, that's better.

2540
02:07:19.581 --> 02:07:21.118
Hello, Critters, and good evening.

2541
02:07:21.118 --> 02:07:23.709
I'm Yev and I'm back with Backblaze.

2542
02:07:23.709 --> 02:07:27.260
So much has happened since the last time I saw you.

2543
02:07:27.260 --> 02:07:31.251
(chuckles) Does that work or does that look just silly?

2544
02:07:31.251 --> 02:07:33.217
The Mighty Nein have been hard at work

2545
02:07:33.217 --> 02:07:36.771
doing whatever it is they're trying to do anymore.

2546
02:07:36.771 --> 02:07:38.590
I think that is sufficiently vague

2547
02:07:38.590 --> 02:07:42.317
and also perfectly encapsulates how the show is going.

2548
02:07:42.317 --> 02:07:44.579
Some of you may have never heard about Backblaze

2549
02:07:44.579 --> 02:07:46.429
and others may have just been waiting

2550
02:07:46.429 --> 02:07:48.379
to see my pretty face again.

2551
02:07:48.379 --> 02:07:49.789
Nope, let's start over.

2552
02:07:49.789 --> 02:07:51.931
Backblaze is an online backup service

2553
02:07:51.931 --> 02:07:54.512
for your Mac or your PC. It backs up all the data

2554
02:07:54.512 --> 02:07:57.341
that's on your computer and stores it safely on our cloud.

2555
02:07:57.341 --> 02:07:59.931
Whenever you need it back, we can get it back to you

2556
02:07:59.931 --> 02:08:01.301
and you can get back up and running.

2557
02:08:01.301 --> 02:08:03.453
Or if you just want to show off some of your fan art,

2558
02:08:03.453 --> 02:08:05.893
or fan fiction, you can pull it down right on your phone

2559
02:08:05.893 --> 02:08:08.595
and have it available with you, wherever you are.

2560
02:08:08.595 --> 02:08:10.343
Oh, I don't want that to be visible.

2561
02:08:10.343 --> 02:08:11.503
Has it been visible this whole time?

2562
02:08:11.503 --> 02:08:14.151
It's nice to be back, we love sponsoring the show.

2563
02:08:14.151 --> 02:08:16.922
We love supporting the Critical Role and Critter community.

2564
02:08:16.922 --> 02:08:19.551
Go to Backblaze.com/CriticalRole.

2565
02:08:19.551 --> 02:08:21.491
Start your free Backblaze trial.

2566
02:08:21.491 --> 02:08:24.892
It's just six dollars a month for unlimited backup.

2567
02:08:24.892 --> 02:08:27.212
You can back up all the data that's on your computer.

2568
02:08:27.212 --> 02:08:28.471
We'll store it for you.

2569
02:08:28.471 --> 02:08:30.041
Look at this trustworthy face.

2570
02:08:30.041 --> 02:08:31.424
No, see, now it's just going off the rails.

2571
02:08:31.424 --> 02:08:32.661
I wish I could start singing again

2572
02:08:32.661 --> 02:08:34.175
because that was going so much better.

2573
02:08:34.175 --> 02:08:35.494
I'm Yev with Backblaze.

2574
02:08:35.494 --> 02:08:38.501
It's been a blast sharing the screen time with you again

2575
02:08:38.501 --> 02:08:39.935
and I'll see you next time.

2576
02:08:39.935 --> 02:08:42.768
(humming "We Didn't Start the Fire")

2577
02:08:46.694 --> 02:08:49.095
BRIAN (V.O.): Last time, on Talks Machina.

2578
02:08:49.095 --> 02:08:51.043
BRIAN: Nott has been working hard for a long time

2579
02:08:51.043 --> 02:08:53.565
to reconnect Caleb with Astrid.

2580
02:08:53.565 --> 02:08:55.485
Does Nott just think this is the best way

2581
02:08:55.485 --> 02:08:56.986
to make her friend happy?

2582
02:08:56.986 --> 02:08:59.029
Or does she have other reasons for seemingly

2583
02:08:59.029 --> 02:09:01.237
going against Caleb's wishes on the matter

2584
02:09:01.237 --> 02:09:03.885
and trying to push a reunion?

2585
02:09:03.885 --> 02:09:08.885
SAM: Nott is just trying to get Caleb laid,

2586
02:09:09.266 --> 02:09:12.683
because Astrid, for all that we've heard,

2587
02:09:13.633 --> 02:09:18.633
is a gorgeous Zemnian young lady,

2588
02:09:18.994 --> 02:09:23.952
with talents for magic, who titillated Caleb in his youth,

2589
02:09:25.090 --> 02:09:30.090
and if they can somehow get together and, you know, (grunts)

2590
02:09:31.792 --> 02:09:36.125
everyone who sees Caleb-- that's fucking, by the way.

2591
02:09:37.948 --> 02:09:40.809
Everyone who sees Caleb has to admit

2592
02:09:40.809 --> 02:09:43.142
has to know that this guy...

2593
02:09:44.849 --> 02:09:47.925
He needs some fuckin'.

2594
02:09:47.925 --> 02:09:49.676
This guy needs to get--

2595
02:09:49.676 --> 02:09:51.564
BRIAN: Does Nott believe that would solve maybe

2596
02:09:51.564 --> 02:09:55.155
a lot of his problems?
SAM: Yeah, loosen this guy up!

2597
02:09:55.155 --> 02:10:00.155
He's been 11 years just wallowing in self pity.

2598
02:10:00.391 --> 02:10:03.632
LIAM: Technically, he was vegetative, but--

2599
02:10:03.632 --> 02:10:06.851
SAM: Yeah, wallowing, in a vegetative state,

2600
02:10:06.851 --> 02:10:10.440
when he could have been railing Astrid.

2601
02:10:10.440 --> 02:10:11.523
DANI: Wow.
BRIAN: Okay.

2602
02:10:13.048 --> 02:10:15.588
Well, the only thing that could save us now

2603
02:10:15.588 --> 02:10:17.379
is probably Cosplay of the Week.

2604
02:10:17.379 --> 02:10:21.827
Our winner for this week was sent in by KP, which is @KP.

2605
02:10:21.827 --> 02:10:23.788
Is it 11 photos?

2606
02:10:23.788 --> 02:10:25.535
CREW MEMBER: One one.
BRIAN: Thank you.

2607
02:10:25.535 --> 02:10:27.401
@KP11photos.

2608
02:10:28.945 --> 02:10:30.631
Here we go.

2609
02:10:30.631 --> 02:10:31.801
SAM: Here we go.

2610
02:10:31.801 --> 02:10:33.644
Ooh!
DANI: Yes!

2611
02:10:33.644 --> 02:10:35.546
LIAM: Nice.
BRIAN: Look at that.

2612
02:10:35.546 --> 02:10:38.584
Such a great take on Gilmore.

2613
02:10:38.584 --> 02:10:40.170
DANI: Looks so good!

2614
02:10:40.170 --> 02:10:42.192
BRIAN: You've mentioned previously that

2615
02:10:42.192 --> 02:10:43.822
due to his time in the asylum,

2616
02:10:43.822 --> 02:10:46.443
you think of Caleb as much younger than he is.

2617
02:10:46.443 --> 02:10:48.793
Is Caleb conscious of this gap between

2618
02:10:48.793 --> 02:10:51.374
his physical and mental age, and if so,

2619
02:10:51.374 --> 02:10:53.980
how has he processed being in a body 11 years

2620
02:10:53.980 --> 02:10:55.563
older than he feels?

2621
02:10:55.563 --> 02:10:59.151
Has seeing Eodwulf-- I was only going to get it once--

2622
02:10:59.151 --> 02:11:02.928
again thrown into this sharp relief?

2623
02:11:02.928 --> 02:11:06.751
LIAM: I think the only sense he has of the fact

2624
02:11:06.751 --> 02:11:09.161
that he missed a huge portion of his life

2625
02:11:09.161 --> 02:11:13.319
is seeing Ikithon and seeing Eodwulf

2626
02:11:13.319 --> 02:11:15.471
because it's a grown ass man in front of him

2627
02:11:15.471 --> 02:11:18.031
instead of a teenage boy, which is what we he remembers.

2628
02:11:18.031 --> 02:11:19.635
And Ikithon is pastier and older.

2629
02:11:19.635 --> 02:11:22.956
He was old and pasty then, but he is pastier.

2630
02:11:22.956 --> 02:11:25.509
He doesn't walk around thinking like

2631
02:11:25.509 --> 02:11:27.853
"Oh, I'm Tom Hanks in Big.

2632
02:11:27.853 --> 02:11:30.024
"I am the wrong age for my size."

2633
02:11:30.024 --> 02:11:33.573
I mean, he definitely is like, I lost a huge thing,

2634
02:11:33.573 --> 02:11:37.024
but he's just him, I don't know.

2635
02:11:37.024 --> 02:11:39.213
I don't know, he more just feels like he lost time.

2636
02:11:39.213 --> 02:11:42.849
He doesn't feel like a 15-year-old piloting an adult's body.

2637
02:11:42.849 --> 02:11:43.937
BRIAN: Right, yeah.

2638
02:11:43.937 --> 02:11:47.822
SAM: However, living in a body that's 11 years older

2639
02:11:47.822 --> 02:11:51.009
than you feel is something that I can relate to,

2640
02:11:51.009 --> 02:11:54.184
because I feel 24,

2641
02:11:55.577 --> 02:11:57.644
but I am 35.

2642
02:11:57.644 --> 02:12:00.297
(laughter)

2643
02:12:08.446 --> 02:12:11.695
LIAM: Submit!
(laughter)

2644
02:12:11.695 --> 02:12:13.193
BRIAN: There it is.

2645
02:12:13.193 --> 02:12:15.764
At what point, pre or during the campaign,

2646
02:12:15.764 --> 02:12:19.246
did you come up with the idea for Nott's crush on Caleb?

2647
02:12:19.246 --> 02:12:21.652
Has it affected the amount of conflict she feels about

2648
02:12:21.652 --> 02:12:24.542
going back to her former life?

2649
02:12:24.542 --> 02:12:26.317
SAM: Nott is a...

2650
02:12:27.896 --> 02:12:31.396
Sexual woman, and she sees that there is a

2651
02:12:33.474 --> 02:12:37.304
potential for a sexual man in front of her.

2652
02:12:37.304 --> 02:12:38.991
BRIAN: But he's busy blasting Astrid!

2653
02:12:38.991 --> 02:12:41.284
SAM: But he's not, he's not!

2654
02:12:41.284 --> 02:12:42.834
BRIAN: You don't know that for sure.

2655
02:12:42.834 --> 02:12:45.324
SAM: She wants him to blast someone, and if Astrid

2656
02:12:45.324 --> 02:12:48.171
is out of the picture, she's perfectly capable.

2657
02:12:48.171 --> 02:12:49.585
BRIAN: But blastin' Nott doesn't have

2658
02:12:49.585 --> 02:12:51.225
the same ring to it.
DANI: Nott is married!

2659
02:12:51.225 --> 02:12:52.832
SAM: Nott is married, but not for a while.

2660
02:12:52.832 --> 02:12:55.410
Didn't think that she was ever
going to see her husband again

2661
02:12:55.410 --> 02:12:59.377
and there's long nights on the road, huddling for warmth.

2662
02:12:59.377 --> 02:13:01.713
I mean, she'd be stupid not to at least

2663
02:13:01.713 --> 02:13:04.954
consider the idea of this rugged wizard guy.

2664
02:13:04.954 --> 02:13:06.156
LIAM: Rather than blasting Astrid,

2665
02:13:06.156 --> 02:13:08.486
are you suggesting a Nott Pocket?

2666
02:13:08.486 --> 02:13:11.064
DANI: Oh, no!
BRIAN: ♪ Nott Pocket. ♪

2667
02:13:11.064 --> 02:13:13.581
SAM: Oh, it's happening.
DANI: Ooh.

2668
02:13:13.581 --> 02:13:16.086
LIAM: I mean, this is how you look to me all the time.

2669
02:13:16.086 --> 02:13:19.379
Now the audience can see it, too.

2670
02:13:19.379 --> 02:13:23.955
SAM: I'm just saying, it makes a lot of sense to me.

2671
02:13:23.955 --> 02:13:26.803
BRIAN: Look at him while you talk while you answer this.

2672
02:13:26.803 --> 02:13:27.636
SAM: Caleb.

2673
02:13:27.636 --> 02:13:29.115
BRIAN: No, look at each other, you idiots.

2674
02:13:29.115 --> 02:13:29.948
SAM: Liam.

2675
02:13:29.948 --> 02:13:30.781
BRIAN: People are paying good money.

2676
02:13:30.781 --> 02:13:31.614
We paid a lot of money for these effects.

2677
02:13:31.614 --> 02:13:35.465
SAM: Will you be will you be--
will you have a fictional affair

2678
02:13:35.465 --> 02:13:37.510
with my fictional character?

2679
02:13:37.510 --> 02:13:39.952
LIAM: Are you asking me to ham Sam?

2680
02:13:39.952 --> 02:13:44.819
BRIAN: He's asking you to avoid blasting Astrid--

2681
02:13:44.819 --> 02:13:46.089
LIAM: I'll take the ham Samwich.

2682
02:13:46.089 --> 02:13:48.309
BRIAN: And instead to plot Nott.

2683
02:13:48.309 --> 02:13:50.178
SAM: Fuck the brave. (laughs)

2684
02:13:50.178 --> 02:13:53.298
BRIAN: "Fuck the brave."
DANI: What is this episode?

2685
02:13:53.298 --> 02:13:55.243
BRIAN: Fuck the brave.
LIAM: This is it.

2686
02:13:55.243 --> 02:13:56.889
This is the worst one.

2687
02:13:56.889 --> 02:14:01.774
The last one of 2019, the last episode of Talks Machina.

2688
02:14:01.774 --> 02:14:03.820
This is the worst one.

2689
02:14:03.820 --> 02:14:08.795
(dramatic orchestral music)

2690
02:27:15.139 --> 02:27:18.459
MATT: Welcome back.
(laughter)

2691
02:27:18.459 --> 02:27:20.129
TALIESIN: Oh, that was weird.
MATT: Almost.

2692
02:27:20.129 --> 02:27:22.120
MARISHA: I've never been this successful in my life.

2693
02:27:22.120 --> 02:27:23.308
MATT: That's okay.

2694
02:27:23.308 --> 02:27:24.518
TALIESIN: She's going to chip a tooth.

2695
02:27:24.518 --> 02:27:26.606
MATT: You got other things to do successfully.

2696
02:27:26.606 --> 02:27:28.396
We do have our winner of our Wyrmwood giveaway.

2697
02:27:28.396 --> 02:27:31.529
The winner tonight is Broke Little Toe.

2698
02:27:31.529 --> 02:27:32.695
ALL: Aww.

2699
02:27:32.695 --> 02:27:34.145
TRAVIS: Those are the worst, man.
MATT: I know.

2700
02:27:34.145 --> 02:27:38.775
Congratulations, Broke Little Toe.

2701
02:27:38.775 --> 02:27:42.358
We'll get that to you ASAP, happy holidays.

2702
02:27:43.273 --> 02:27:44.658
TALIESIN: No, I'm good.
MATT: So!

2703
02:27:44.658 --> 02:27:47.186
ASHLEY: Oh, good one.
LAURA: Mm-hm.

2704
02:27:47.186 --> 02:27:48.775
ASHLEY: You get the thing and--

2705
02:27:48.775 --> 02:27:50.923
TALIESIN: It's the Aron Berg sack.

2706
02:27:50.923 --> 02:27:52.163
MATT: As you all rest for the evening-- by the way,

2707
02:27:52.163 --> 02:27:54.334
your 24-hour reading span, if you're still going through

2708
02:27:54.334 --> 02:27:56.323
the night, is reduced to, I'll say,

2709
02:27:56.323 --> 02:27:59.913
with the search and everything, to 21 hours.

2710
02:27:59.913 --> 02:28:01.432
ASHLEY: Got it.

2711
02:28:01.432 --> 02:28:03.262
MATT: You still do have a point of exhaustion,

2712
02:28:03.262 --> 02:28:06.837
which will carry into this fight.

2713
02:28:08.321 --> 02:28:09.570
And if it happens the next evening,

2714
02:28:09.570 --> 02:28:13.399
so as you all come to the next morning...

2715
02:28:13.399 --> 02:28:15.405
MARISHA: That's so bad ass.

2716
02:28:15.405 --> 02:28:16.940
MATT: The day is yours.

2717
02:28:16.940 --> 02:28:18.671
Anything else you want to accomplish during the day,

2718
02:28:18.671 --> 02:28:21.362
or do you want to--
LAURA: During the day.

2719
02:28:21.362 --> 02:28:23.503
MARISHA: Back to the library!

2720
02:28:23.503 --> 02:28:24.433
SAM: Oh, god.

2721
02:28:24.433 --> 02:28:25.450
MARISHA: For me.
MATT: Okay, all right.

2722
02:28:25.450 --> 02:28:27.782
Well, starting with Beauregard.

2723
02:28:27.782 --> 02:28:28.930
You make your way back to--

2724
02:28:28.930 --> 02:28:30.844
MARISHA: Before I leave, though, I go, Jess?

2725
02:28:30.844 --> 02:28:33.302
I'm going to the library, if you want to come,

2726
02:28:33.302 --> 02:28:35.134
just throwin' it out there, you don't have to,

2727
02:28:35.134 --> 02:28:37.615
but I felt bad about not inviting you before.

2728
02:28:37.615 --> 02:28:39.908
LAURA: Cool, I think I'm okay.

2729
02:28:39.908 --> 02:28:42.628
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2730
02:28:42.628 --> 02:28:46.268
Do you want anything?
LAURA: Draw some dicks, please.

2731
02:28:46.268 --> 02:28:48.595
MARISHA: Okay, yeah.
LAURA: Or anything you want to.

2732
02:28:48.595 --> 02:28:51.064
It doesn't have to be dicks, Beau.

2733
02:28:51.064 --> 02:28:54.048
You could draw an elephant butt.

2734
02:28:54.048 --> 02:28:54.881
MARISHA: Okay.

2735
02:28:56.008 --> 02:28:59.716
Just something about that is funny to me.

2736
02:28:59.716 --> 02:29:01.073
LAURA: It is.
MARISHA: All right, I'm going to go.

2737
02:29:01.073 --> 02:29:03.713
TALIESIN: Are you going to the library?

2738
02:29:03.713 --> 02:29:05.233
MARISHA: Yeah, do you want to go, Cad?

2739
02:29:05.233 --> 02:29:07.342
TALIESIN: I mean, kind of, yeah.

2740
02:29:07.342 --> 02:29:08.775
MARISHA: Okay, okay, yeah.

2741
02:29:08.775 --> 02:29:09.855
(Taliesin screams)

2742
02:29:09.855 --> 02:29:11.905
MARISHA: Okay!
(laughter)

2743
02:29:11.905 --> 02:29:14.436
ASHLEY: That's sounding a lot better.

2744
02:29:14.436 --> 02:29:16.080
TALIESIN: No, I'm really getting it together.

2745
02:29:16.080 --> 02:29:17.580
MARISHA: Dude, you can't,

2746
02:29:18.670 --> 02:29:21.191
take that.

2747
02:29:21.191 --> 02:29:23.441
TALIESIN: Oh, I'll stay here, then.

2748
02:29:27.911 --> 02:29:29.421
MARISHA: Okay, anybody else?

2749
02:29:29.421 --> 02:29:32.150
I'm going to the library!

2750
02:29:32.150 --> 02:29:35.459
SAM: No, have fun, though!
MARISHA: Don't, Cad.

2751
02:29:35.459 --> 02:29:37.459
LIAM: Enjoy yourself.

2752
02:29:37.459 --> 02:29:39.161
Enjoy it for me, will you?

2753
02:29:39.161 --> 02:29:41.092
MARISHA: Yeah, are you sure you're good?

2754
02:29:41.092 --> 02:29:42.702
You're working on your thing?

2755
02:29:42.702 --> 02:29:44.283
LIAM: I have a little homework, yeah.

2756
02:29:44.283 --> 02:29:47.179
MARISHA: I mean, they've got lounges there, like studies,

2757
02:29:47.179 --> 02:29:49.907
if you just want to change your scenery, you know?

2758
02:29:49.907 --> 02:29:54.614
Sometimes, I find that just a change in visual perspective

2759
02:29:54.614 --> 02:29:59.614
might help you make some more progress, get out of this BnB.

2760
02:29:59.702 --> 02:30:01.748
SAM: Don't distract him, he's trying to save my life!

2761
02:30:01.748 --> 02:30:04.138
MARISHA: All right, okay, I'm going to fucking go, what?

2762
02:30:04.138 --> 02:30:06.315
LIAM: That's a fair point.

2763
02:30:06.315 --> 02:30:09.226
I will do my homework at the library.

2764
02:30:09.226 --> 02:30:10.527
I won't get in your way.

2765
02:30:10.527 --> 02:30:13.427
MARISHA: Okay. Yeah, let's go.

2766
02:30:13.427 --> 02:30:15.761
LAURA: Have fun, you two.

2767
02:30:15.761 --> 02:30:17.308
MATT: So just the two of you going to the library?

2768
02:30:17.308 --> 02:30:18.141
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: All right.

2769
02:30:18.141 --> 02:30:21.676
LIAM: And I'm bring all of my (drawn out) Halas papers.

2770
02:30:21.676 --> 02:30:23.259
MATT: You got it.
TRAVIS: Wow.

2771
02:30:24.428 --> 02:30:25.767
LIAM: Christmas in Halas.

2772
02:30:25.767 --> 02:30:27.296
MATT: You make your way to the Rexxentrum Archive.

2773
02:30:27.296 --> 02:30:30.218
The library is open to the Expositor Beauregard.

2774
02:30:30.218 --> 02:30:31.051
MARISHA: Okay.

2775
02:30:33.450 --> 02:30:38.411
Who and when instituted the six approved gods of the Empire?

2776
02:30:38.411 --> 02:30:40.326
TRAVIS: What the fuck did you just say?

2777
02:30:40.326 --> 02:30:44.115
MARISHA: Who and when instituted

2778
02:30:44.115 --> 02:30:47.014
the six approved gods of the Empire?

2779
02:30:47.014 --> 02:30:47.847
MATT: Okay.

2780
02:30:47.847 --> 02:30:49.284
MARISHA: Is the first thing that I want to investigate.

2781
02:30:49.284 --> 02:30:51.420
MATT: Roll an investigation check.

2782
02:30:51.420 --> 02:30:55.025
MARISHA: Okay, because if it
was Dwendal, that's interesting.

2783
02:30:55.025 --> 02:30:57.666
If it wasn't Dwendal, that's also interesting.

2784
02:30:57.666 --> 02:31:00.189
LIAM: Marisha "Beauregard" Ray.
MARISHA: Dwendal.

2785
02:31:00.189 --> 02:31:02.100
LIAM: Get it.
MARISHA: What is that, what is that?

2786
02:31:02.100 --> 02:31:04.147
I don't want to, do I want to use this one?

2787
02:31:04.147 --> 02:31:05.347
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, that one's fine.

2788
02:31:05.347 --> 02:31:06.686
MARISHA: This one's fine?
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah.

2789
02:31:06.686 --> 02:31:07.850
MARISHA: You've been rolling real good all day.

2790
02:31:07.850 --> 02:31:09.950
LIAM: It's the shitty plain blue one that sucks.

2791
02:31:09.950 --> 02:31:12.758
MARISHA: Okay, okay!

2792
02:31:14.433 --> 02:31:15.981
28.

2793
02:31:15.981 --> 02:31:17.448
MATT: 28, yeah.

2794
02:31:18.834 --> 02:31:22.123
It is not Dwendal, actually.

2795
02:31:22.123 --> 02:31:25.843
Looking it up specifically and give me just a moment here.

2796
02:31:25.843 --> 02:31:26.996
MARISHA: Sorry.

2797
02:31:26.996 --> 02:31:29.579
MATT: No, it's all good, deep dive.

2798
02:31:33.196 --> 02:31:36.463
Okay, shortly after the time of the Marrow War,

2799
02:31:36.463 --> 02:31:40.045
which was when the Empire and the Julous Dominion

2800
02:31:40.045 --> 02:31:43.922
were at war over the northern and southern regions.

2801
02:31:43.922 --> 02:31:45.839
MARISHA: And that's like early

2802
02:31:47.685 --> 02:31:50.616
Kryn Dynasty versus Empire, right?

2803
02:31:50.616 --> 02:31:52.314
MATT: This isn't Dynasty involved.

2804
02:31:52.314 --> 02:31:54.088
This is Julous Dominion, which is the other human

2805
02:31:54.088 --> 02:31:55.776
civilization that lives to the south.

2806
02:31:55.776 --> 02:31:59.624
This is where Zadash used to be the capital of.

2807
02:31:59.624 --> 02:32:02.194
MARISHA: So it's a war between the Empire and the Julous.

2808
02:32:02.194 --> 02:32:04.071
Old Empire.
LIAM: Boundaries, old countries.

2809
02:32:04.071 --> 02:32:04.940
MARISHA: Old countries.

2810
02:32:04.940 --> 02:32:08.447
MATT: We're talking around 545 PD.

2811
02:32:08.447 --> 02:32:10.796
So this would have been hundreds of years back.

2812
02:32:10.796 --> 02:32:12.046
MARISHA: Right, right.

2813
02:32:17.565 --> 02:32:21.274
MATT: Because a lot of the priests that rebelled

2814
02:32:21.274 --> 02:32:24.113
from the Julous Dominion against

2815
02:32:24.113 --> 02:32:27.946
the rule of the Empire, the emperor the time,

2816
02:32:28.992 --> 02:32:32.242
which would have been Manfried Dwendal.

2817
02:32:34.400 --> 02:32:37.194
He was the one, his spies had discovered

2818
02:32:37.194 --> 02:32:39.320
that a lot of the Julous' interests

2819
02:32:39.320 --> 02:32:40.562
and a lot of the people that were rising up against him

2820
02:32:40.562 --> 02:32:42.362
were priests of a lot of these various religions

2821
02:32:42.362 --> 02:32:45.048
and they were using religion as their large tool

2822
02:32:45.048 --> 02:32:49.841
to cause people to rebel against the Empire's rule.

2823
02:32:49.841 --> 02:32:54.833
And as such, he wanted to abolish all religious

2824
02:32:54.833 --> 02:32:57.941
worship within their area, but

2825
02:32:57.941 --> 02:33:00.245
it caused even a further uproar

2826
02:33:00.245 --> 02:33:02.034
and a lot of the fury just even further

2827
02:33:02.034 --> 02:33:03.109
fed into the Julous Dominion,

2828
02:33:03.109 --> 02:33:05.584
so when they had finished they had decided to

2829
02:33:05.584 --> 02:33:08.076
choose a handful of ones that fit

2830
02:33:08.076 --> 02:33:12.060
easily within the overall goals of the Empire

2831
02:33:12.060 --> 02:33:14.809
and so the deities that were chosen were those that

2832
02:33:14.809 --> 02:33:18.893
fit within its ideas of society,

2833
02:33:18.893 --> 02:33:23.811
and knowledge and, you know,

2834
02:33:23.811 --> 02:33:26.121
things that aligned with their goals

2835
02:33:26.121 --> 02:33:28.352
easier than other entities

2836
02:33:28.352 --> 02:33:30.491
that perhaps wouldn't be down with an Empire.

2837
02:33:30.491 --> 02:33:32.963
LIAM: So the gods and their... stans

2838
02:33:32.963 --> 02:33:36.291
were getting in the way of progress and science?

2839
02:33:36.291 --> 02:33:37.923
MATT: To an extent, I guess you could say

2840
02:33:37.923 --> 02:33:39.552
from some perspectives, yeah.

2841
02:33:39.552 --> 02:33:40.969
MARISHA: So Manfried...

2842
02:33:42.661 --> 02:33:47.051
So Manfried was like, "Ah, this Melora shit

2843
02:33:47.051 --> 02:33:51.024
"and this Kord shit is like, not cool, because,

2844
02:33:51.024 --> 02:33:53.533
"you're blasting me with lightning and shit."

2845
02:33:53.533 --> 02:33:55.237
MATT: More or less, yeah.

2846
02:33:55.237 --> 02:33:57.299
A lot of the philosophies were harder

2847
02:33:57.299 --> 02:34:00.157
to fold into the philosophies of the Empire.

2848
02:34:00.157 --> 02:34:02.437
Remember, they didn't destroy the Julous Dominion

2849
02:34:02.437 --> 02:34:03.937
and burn everything down.

2850
02:34:03.937 --> 02:34:07.439
They defeated the people that were helming the

2851
02:34:07.439 --> 02:34:10.183
Julous Dominion and then told everybody who was part of it,

2852
02:34:10.183 --> 02:34:11.840
"Your lives can continue as they are,

2853
02:34:11.840 --> 02:34:13.379
"you're just now members of the Empire

2854
02:34:13.379 --> 02:34:15.318
"and you now go through our tax system.

2855
02:34:15.318 --> 02:34:18.602
"We're here, but your life doesn't change and we're good."

2856
02:34:18.602 --> 02:34:20.592
At that point, there was no other alternative,

2857
02:34:20.592 --> 02:34:23.526
and then it was absorbed into the Empire and the Empire

2858
02:34:23.526 --> 02:34:25.791
now spanned the entirety of this portion--

2859
02:34:25.791 --> 02:34:28.582
MARISHA: So like old-school Britain for a while?

2860
02:34:28.582 --> 02:34:29.915
MATT: Yeah, kind of.

2861
02:34:30.984 --> 02:34:32.815
Phew, went to deep question there, all righty.

2862
02:34:32.815 --> 02:34:34.815
I had to go into the history archive.

2863
02:34:34.815 --> 02:34:37.706
MARISHA: So that means that basically

2864
02:34:37.706 --> 02:34:39.895
the six approved deities of the Empire

2865
02:34:39.895 --> 02:34:44.134
are so systematically and innately taught

2866
02:34:44.134 --> 02:34:46.774
that it's hard for anyone, especially you mentioned

2867
02:34:46.774 --> 02:34:50.285
Manfried Dwendal, so that means that it is like a

2868
02:34:50.285 --> 02:34:52.805
true monarchy in terms of only--

2869
02:34:52.805 --> 02:34:55.565
MATT: Correct, it is through blood or marriage monarchy.

2870
02:34:55.565 --> 02:34:58.074
MARISHA: Through blood line.
MATT: Yeah.

2871
02:34:58.074 --> 02:34:59.824
MARISHA: And it's just that,

2872
02:35:01.913 --> 02:35:05.973
forced-upon of like, "These are good and these are bad."

2873
02:35:05.973 --> 02:35:09.231
That it's like systemic bigotry.

2874
02:35:09.231 --> 02:35:11.198
MATT: Kind of, yeah, and to that point, too,

2875
02:35:11.198 --> 02:35:13.590
it's not like they throw you in prison forever

2876
02:35:13.590 --> 02:35:16.571
if they catch you praying to another god.

2877
02:35:16.571 --> 02:35:19.438
You get fined for it, with a little bit of jail time

2878
02:35:19.438 --> 02:35:21.792
and there are many people that do worship other gods

2879
02:35:21.792 --> 02:35:26.439
very, very privately and just keep it out of the public eye.

2880
02:35:26.439 --> 02:35:30.552
You have a couple of them in your party.

2881
02:35:30.552 --> 02:35:33.169
But yeah, so it's...

2882
02:35:34.022 --> 02:35:36.319
People getting busted for praying to other gods

2883
02:35:36.319 --> 02:35:38.972
would be the equivalent of busted for marijuana possession

2884
02:35:38.972 --> 02:35:41.187
in a lot states in the US.
MARISHA: Right, or like jaywalking.

2885
02:35:41.187 --> 02:35:42.020
MATT: Yeah.

2886
02:35:43.130 --> 02:35:44.743
TRAVIS: That's where I went, too.

2887
02:35:44.743 --> 02:35:46.802
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
TRAVIS: You're like, "Really, bro?

2888
02:35:46.802 --> 02:35:47.993
"A ticket?"
MATT: You're breaking the law,

2889
02:35:47.993 --> 02:35:50.028
but should it be against the law?

2890
02:35:50.028 --> 02:35:52.845
MARISHA: Come on, are you that bored?

2891
02:35:52.845 --> 02:35:55.325
TALIESIN: Or smoking on the street, dude, I mean, come on.

2892
02:35:55.325 --> 02:35:56.965
MATT: Yeah, (laughs) exactly.

2893
02:35:56.965 --> 02:35:59.392
LIAM: Somewhere in all of this, while you're reading,

2894
02:35:59.392 --> 02:36:02.891
Caleb looks up and remembers their first trip to library

2895
02:36:02.891 --> 02:36:06.130
together, where you just fucking hated the books,

2896
02:36:06.130 --> 02:36:08.775
and smiles at her, totally engrossed,

2897
02:36:08.775 --> 02:36:11.480
just watches for a bit and goes back to what he's doing.

2898
02:36:11.480 --> 02:36:13.200
MATT: Fair enough.
MARISHA: Okay.

2899
02:36:13.200 --> 02:36:14.745
Do I have another question?

2900
02:36:14.745 --> 02:36:18.006
MATT: Do you have another question?

2901
02:36:18.006 --> 02:36:21.934
MARISHA: Okay, and correct me if I already know this--

2902
02:36:21.934 --> 02:36:25.174
LIAM: Who is on the Tal'Dorei Council?

2903
02:36:25.174 --> 02:36:27.268
MATT: Every time he asks, somebody on it dies.

2904
02:36:27.268 --> 02:36:30.786
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck!
(laughter)

2905
02:36:30.786 --> 02:36:33.338
TALIESIN: Who's left on this council?
TRAVIS: All these ravens start landing.

2906
02:36:33.338 --> 02:36:35.818
MATT: That's the question to ask.

2907
02:36:35.818 --> 02:36:39.416
MARISHA: Yeah, Birds style, just (impacts).

2908
02:36:39.416 --> 02:36:41.999
(laughter)

2909
02:36:43.215 --> 02:36:46.028
TRAVIS: I felt a great disturbance in...

2910
02:36:46.028 --> 02:36:47.945
MARISHA: The six shackles of--

2911
02:36:49.705 --> 02:36:50.847
LIAM: Shix shackles.

2912
02:36:50.847 --> 02:36:53.188
MARISHA: The shix shackles of the--

2913
02:36:53.188 --> 02:36:56.332
MATT and MARISHA: Chained Oblivion.

2914
02:36:56.332 --> 02:36:58.513
MARISHA: We saw three shackles.

2915
02:36:58.513 --> 02:37:01.870
MATT: You saw one. You've only encountered one shackle.

2916
02:37:01.870 --> 02:37:03.080
TRAVIS: That was just one.

2917
02:37:03.080 --> 02:37:05.413
MARISHA: One shackle, three chains.

2918
02:37:06.310 --> 02:37:07.881
LIAM: Jusht the one.

2919
02:37:07.881 --> 02:37:08.714
MARISHA: Okay.

2920
02:37:08.714 --> 02:37:11.100
MATT: And for the record, "the shackle" is a term.

2921
02:37:11.100 --> 02:37:13.268
There is no actual physical chain.

2922
02:37:13.268 --> 02:37:16.769
MARISHA: I was thinking the chains,
like there's two locations.

2923
02:37:16.769 --> 02:37:20.936
MATT: "The shackle," it's a metaphorical term for this--

2924
02:37:21.980 --> 02:37:23.321
TALIESIN: Like the Pentagon.

2925
02:37:23.321 --> 02:37:26.900
MATT: This artifact that is one of
six things that helped bind--

2926
02:37:26.900 --> 02:37:28.358
that initially helped bind it

2927
02:37:28.358 --> 02:37:30.717
before the Divine Gate was instituted.

2928
02:37:30.717 --> 02:37:33.847
I mean, in theory, if all the shackles were still broken,

2929
02:37:33.847 --> 02:37:35.257
the Chained Oblivion is still in the Abyss and still on the

2930
02:37:35.257 --> 02:37:37.944
other side of the Divine Gate, but the Chained Oblivion

2931
02:37:37.944 --> 02:37:41.357
is so different than all the other Betrayer Gods

2932
02:37:41.357 --> 02:37:45.506
and the type of power and danger that represents

2933
02:37:45.506 --> 02:37:47.917
is so unknown that there's worry that there was

2934
02:37:47.917 --> 02:37:50.828
a Betrayer God that could break through the Divine Gate.

2935
02:37:50.828 --> 02:37:52.468
Betrayer God could maybe be one of them?

2936
02:37:52.468 --> 02:37:56.458
I'm sorry, Chained Oblivion would be the one to do it.

2937
02:37:56.458 --> 02:37:57.560
LAURA: That's sick.

2938
02:37:57.560 --> 02:38:02.409
MARISHA: So my question was, where are the other shackles?

2939
02:38:02.409 --> 02:38:04.951
Can I find any information on where the other shackles are?

2940
02:38:04.951 --> 02:38:07.199
MATT: Roll an investigation check.

2941
02:38:07.199 --> 02:38:10.339
TRAVIS: Is the Dawnfather the main deity in Rexxentrum

2942
02:38:10.339 --> 02:38:12.081
or shared equally among the five?

2943
02:38:12.081 --> 02:38:13.883
MATT: It's shared equally amongst them.

2944
02:38:13.883 --> 02:38:14.993
LAURA: But the Dawnfather is like

2945
02:38:14.993 --> 02:38:18.454
the coolest one out of them all.

2946
02:38:18.454 --> 02:38:21.193
MATT: Platinum Dragon's pretty great, Bahamut's great.

2947
02:38:21.193 --> 02:38:23.033
I mean, they're all pretty even,

2948
02:38:23.033 --> 02:38:25.882
and they all have their own different belief systems.

2949
02:38:25.882 --> 02:38:27.305
TRAVIS: Why don't you let me pick first?

2950
02:38:27.305 --> 02:38:29.945
MARISHA: You should have, you should have, natural one.

2951
02:38:29.945 --> 02:38:31.112
MATT: Natural one.

2952
02:38:34.094 --> 02:38:36.291
There is information about the shackles and about

2953
02:38:36.291 --> 02:38:37.677
the binding of the Chained Oblivion,

2954
02:38:37.677 --> 02:38:41.257
but as to the location or information regarding it?

2955
02:38:41.257 --> 02:38:42.657
Nothin'.

2956
02:38:42.657 --> 02:38:46.016
Mind you, based on the scrolls

2957
02:38:46.016 --> 02:38:50.358
that had to be hustled out of Vasselheim by Obann

2958
02:38:50.358 --> 02:38:53.166
and members of the Angel of Irons cult,

2959
02:38:53.166 --> 02:38:55.964
you have information to at least make you think that

2960
02:38:55.964 --> 02:39:00.667
that information is very, very, very

2961
02:39:00.667 --> 02:39:04.025
intentionally near impossible to find.

2962
02:39:04.025 --> 02:39:06.204
TALIESIN: You found the dictionary definition of shackle

2963
02:39:06.204 --> 02:39:07.988
and that's as far as you got.
MATT: Kind of, yeah.

2964
02:39:07.988 --> 02:39:10.565
MARISHA: Like, I know this already!

2965
02:39:10.565 --> 02:39:12.862
TRAVIS: Pretty sure another one would be in Vasselheim.

2966
02:39:12.862 --> 02:39:14.777
MARISHA: Yeah, Vasselheim, sounds right, right?

2967
02:39:14.777 --> 02:39:16.985
MATT: You've got no idea where
any of the other shackles are.

2968
02:39:16.985 --> 02:39:19.634
But Vasselheim, I mean, it's the Dawn City,

2969
02:39:19.634 --> 02:39:22.554
it's where civilization began long before the Calamity,

2970
02:39:22.554 --> 02:39:25.562
before the Age of Arcanum, it was the first city.

2971
02:39:25.562 --> 02:39:28.887
MARISHA: Because that was my thought was, like,

2972
02:39:28.887 --> 02:39:32.952
how far along in progress did they actually make?

2973
02:39:32.952 --> 02:39:35.035
TRAVIS: I think she would know.

2974
02:39:37.229 --> 02:39:39.169
MARISHA: In terms of breaking shackles,

2975
02:39:39.169 --> 02:39:41.213
if you broke another one before?

2976
02:39:41.213 --> 02:39:43.614
TRAVIS: Do you know if they were successful in disarming

2977
02:39:43.614 --> 02:39:45.884
another shackle before they--

2978
02:39:45.884 --> 02:39:48.082
MATT: To your memory, this is the first shackle.

2979
02:39:48.082 --> 02:39:49.984
ASHLEY: No, the first one that we went to

2980
02:39:49.984 --> 02:39:53.651
was the first one that we were able to find.

2981
02:39:56.492 --> 02:39:59.552
MARISHA: Occasionally, I walk by Caleb.

2982
02:39:59.552 --> 02:40:02.005
MATT: That's a natural one on that, too, you spent a lot

2983
02:40:02.005 --> 02:40:04.244
of your day trying to find that information

2984
02:40:04.244 --> 02:40:06.692
and come up with nothing.
LIAM: It's that old magic.

2985
02:40:06.692 --> 02:40:10.444
MARISHA: Occasionally, I walk by Caleb in the later half

2986
02:40:10.444 --> 02:40:15.292
of my day and just go like (grunts) and I walk off.

2987
02:40:15.292 --> 02:40:16.690
TRAVIS: You get those library farts?

2988
02:40:16.690 --> 02:40:17.523
LIAM: Yeah.

2989
02:40:18.799 --> 02:40:20.741
It's fundamental!

2990
02:40:20.741 --> 02:40:23.471
LAURA: I talked about the bookstore poops!

2991
02:40:23.471 --> 02:40:26.282
SAM: Yeah, of course, you walk
into a bookstore, you got to--

2992
02:40:26.282 --> 02:40:27.941
LAURA: It's a thing, it's a condition!

2993
02:40:27.941 --> 02:40:29.159
LIAM: That's cool, though, that's a cool story.

2994
02:40:29.159 --> 02:40:31.641
TRAVIS: You ever go into a library
and your stomach starts hurting?

2995
02:40:31.641 --> 02:40:33.971
LAURA: It's the old pages!

2996
02:40:33.971 --> 02:40:35.942
Dude, there's a condition, it's a condition.

2997
02:40:35.942 --> 02:40:39.304
TRAVIS: There's prune juice and--
LIAM: Beau punches through.

2998
02:40:39.304 --> 02:40:42.110
MATT: So if there's any more questions you have,

2999
02:40:42.110 --> 02:40:44.832
you only have enough time to maybe research one

3000
02:40:44.832 --> 02:40:47.323
that isn't too extensive, depending on your roll,

3001
02:40:47.323 --> 02:40:49.632
because you spent, I'd say, all the research you've pulled

3002
02:40:49.632 --> 02:40:51.181
together from going through all the books and pulling

3003
02:40:51.181 --> 02:40:54.198
everything you have available at the Rexxentrum Archive.

3004
02:40:54.198 --> 02:40:55.400
MARISHA: If I have any extra time--

3005
02:40:55.400 --> 02:40:58.273
MATT: Probably, like, seven hours
you've spent in there already--

3006
02:40:58.273 --> 02:41:00.751
LAURA: There is a phenomenon that explains

3007
02:41:00.751 --> 02:41:02.503
why you poop at book stores.

3008
02:41:02.503 --> 02:41:03.542
SAM: Says Buzzfeed.

3009
02:41:03.542 --> 02:41:07.462
LAURA: It's called the Mariko Aoki phenomenon.

3010
02:41:07.462 --> 02:41:08.568
SAM: I am jealous.

3011
02:41:08.568 --> 02:41:10.213
MATT: Written and created by Mariko Aoki.

3012
02:41:10.213 --> 02:41:12.150
SAM: Yeah, I am jealous of Mariko Aoki.

3013
02:41:12.150 --> 02:41:14.658
LAURA: (reading) Could be caused by the smell of paper

3014
02:41:14.658 --> 02:41:16.369
and having a laxative effect,

3015
02:41:16.369 --> 02:41:19.921
the association with reading on the toilet at home.

3016
02:41:19.921 --> 02:41:21.488
LIAM: Caleb is super regular.

3017
02:41:21.488 --> 02:41:24.946
ASHLEY: I have used the Barnes and Noble toilet a lot.

3018
02:41:24.946 --> 02:41:26.906
TALIESIN: Which Barnes and Noble?

3019
02:41:26.906 --> 02:41:29.401
MATT: Man, I feel bad for the Barnes and Nobles janitors.

3020
02:41:29.401 --> 02:41:30.254
LAURA: There's all these questions.

3021
02:41:30.254 --> 02:41:32.042
Why do I have to poop in book stores?

3022
02:41:32.042 --> 02:41:33.893
It's on there, look it up.

3023
02:41:33.893 --> 02:41:36.274
MATT: Humanity, it's crazy.

3024
02:41:36.274 --> 02:41:38.914
(laughter)

3025
02:41:38.914 --> 02:41:40.614
MARISHA: No, I think I'm good.
MATT: Okay.

3026
02:41:40.614 --> 02:41:42.726
LIAM: Condensed request. We don't even need to dwell on it,

3027
02:41:42.726 --> 02:41:44.475
but for the amount of time we're there,

3028
02:41:44.475 --> 02:41:48.806
Caleb will spend more time on Halas' works.

3029
02:41:48.806 --> 02:41:52.097
I'm sure this is much time,
but I'm going to put in some more

3030
02:41:52.097 --> 02:41:57.097
and then get distracted and pull out the-- everything okay?

3031
02:41:57.275 --> 02:41:58.483
LAURA: Yeah.

3032
02:41:59.446 --> 02:42:02.878
LIAM: The collar--
MARISHA: Are you missing a stone?

3033
02:42:02.878 --> 02:42:04.555
I hate that, sorry, keep going.

3034
02:42:04.555 --> 02:42:08.313
LIAM: Sorry, the collar that got clunked around Caleb's neck

3035
02:42:08.313 --> 02:42:12.854
in Happy Fun Ball and I want to spend a couple hours

3036
02:42:12.854 --> 02:42:17.762
examining it and seeing if it can be used, altered,

3037
02:42:19.443 --> 02:42:21.072
as something that is no longer dead,

3038
02:42:21.072 --> 02:42:23.555
could it be reawakened, enchanted, could I work it

3039
02:42:23.555 --> 02:42:25.663
over time to use it?

3040
02:42:25.663 --> 02:42:28.275
MATT: Okay, well, first for your initial part of the day

3041
02:42:28.275 --> 02:42:30.643
research, go ahead and roll, not an arcana check,

3042
02:42:30.643 --> 02:42:32.112
just a straight intelligence check.

3043
02:42:32.112 --> 02:42:32.945
LIAM: Okay.

3044
02:42:33.820 --> 02:42:34.790
25.

3045
02:42:34.790 --> 02:42:36.098
(Marisha chuckles)

3046
02:42:36.098 --> 02:42:38.307
MATT: What did you roll?
LIAM: 15.

3047
02:42:38.307 --> 02:42:39.808
MATT: Not arcana, intelligence.

3048
02:42:39.808 --> 02:42:43.320
LIAM: Oh, intelligence, oh, sorry sorry sorry.

3049
02:42:43.320 --> 02:42:44.489
Plus five, 20.

3050
02:42:44.489 --> 02:42:47.541
MATT: 20, okay, that's pretty good.

3051
02:42:47.541 --> 02:42:50.764
Okay, you start connecting more of these patterns.

3052
02:42:50.764 --> 02:42:52.014
You begin to...

3053
02:42:53.190 --> 02:42:56.846
to look into the elements, a few transmuted metals

3054
02:42:56.846 --> 02:43:00.596
and elements, but to transmute flesh, bone...

3055
02:43:04.686 --> 02:43:09.017
Things that have a living presence

3056
02:43:09.017 --> 02:43:11.243
is a whole different thing entirely

3057
02:43:11.243 --> 02:43:14.034
and looking at a lot of these elements of Halas' research,

3058
02:43:14.034 --> 02:43:16.543
there are some breakthroughs, but it is incomplete

3059
02:43:16.543 --> 02:43:21.543
and as you continue to improvise in those spaces, too,

3060
02:43:21.724 --> 02:43:24.596
you begin to watch it spiderweb out.

3061
02:43:24.596 --> 02:43:26.927
Like the idea's beginning to expand, it's like--

3062
02:43:26.927 --> 02:43:28.226
thinking it would be a simple equation,

3063
02:43:28.226 --> 02:43:29.935
the equation gets super long and it looks super messy,

3064
02:43:29.935 --> 02:43:32.524
but it's working, but it's super messy.

3065
02:43:32.524 --> 02:43:33.792
But you're getting a little further along,

3066
02:43:33.792 --> 02:43:35.924
you're getting some good leeway on it.

3067
02:43:35.924 --> 02:43:38.286
Once again, who knows how far the goal posts are.

3068
02:43:38.286 --> 02:43:39.993
But you're still working on it.

3069
02:43:39.993 --> 02:43:43.515
As far as working on that neck piece,

3070
02:43:43.515 --> 02:43:46.977
go ahead and make an arcana check for me.

3071
02:43:46.977 --> 02:43:49.816
MARISHA: That just means it's like--
TRAVIS: Like long-ass proofs.

3072
02:43:49.816 --> 02:43:51.387
MARISHA: Yes, that.
LIAM: That's 16.

3073
02:43:51.387 --> 02:43:52.637
MATT: A 16.

3074
02:43:53.980 --> 02:43:55.313
Looking at it...

3075
02:43:56.549 --> 02:43:58.880
You can see recreating the construction of it,

3076
02:43:58.880 --> 02:44:01.338
but the nature of its

3077
02:44:02.758 --> 02:44:06.341
enchantment that prevented spell casting is

3078
02:44:07.618 --> 02:44:12.499
old and a type of magic that you haven't encountered before.

3079
02:44:12.499 --> 02:44:16.169
There are some similarities to the scripts

3080
02:44:16.169 --> 02:44:17.601
that are being used and the spell that you're

3081
02:44:17.601 --> 02:44:19.636
currently working off of Halas' work,

3082
02:44:19.636 --> 02:44:21.990
so a lot of it just plays off of his own script.

3083
02:44:21.990 --> 02:44:26.298
You get the sense that he learned a lot of basic arcane

3084
02:44:26.298 --> 02:44:29.118
techniques and then began to build off of that

3085
02:44:29.118 --> 02:44:32.129
to create his own language within that space

3086
02:44:32.129 --> 02:44:34.070
and that's why it's so challenging to follow.

3087
02:44:34.070 --> 02:44:37.167
With these, you could see the possibility of doing so,

3088
02:44:37.167 --> 02:44:38.917
but you have no idea,

3089
02:44:40.207 --> 02:44:43.930
nor do you have anywhere near the tools.

3090
02:44:43.930 --> 02:44:45.396
Yeah, that's about as far as you can get.

3091
02:44:45.396 --> 02:44:46.761
LIAM: If I just throw a Detect Magic at it,

3092
02:44:46.761 --> 02:44:50.026
what school radiates off of it?

3093
02:44:50.026 --> 02:44:53.193
MATT: For that, I would say it would be...

3094
02:44:56.020 --> 02:44:58.134
I'll say-- let me check something real fast.

3095
02:44:58.134 --> 02:44:59.743
SAM: Dunamancy.

3096
02:45:01.916 --> 02:45:05.205
LIAM: It'll be like the one that's wards.

3097
02:45:05.205 --> 02:45:06.931
MATT: That's what I was going to say.
Abjuration was my first instinct,

3098
02:45:06.931 --> 02:45:11.723
but I'm going to double check real fast, just to be safe.

3099
02:45:16.016 --> 02:45:17.349
Let me see here.

3100
02:45:19.972 --> 02:45:22.389
No, that's not what I wanted.

3101
02:45:29.707 --> 02:45:32.207
Aw, man, come on.

3102
02:45:33.069 --> 02:45:36.859
SAM: This lore dump, brought to you by Dwarven Forge.

3103
02:45:36.859 --> 02:45:38.442
MATT: This would sit...

3104
02:45:39.643 --> 02:45:42.614
There are elements of abjuration and elements of illusion

3105
02:45:42.614 --> 02:45:45.128
working in unison for this.

3106
02:45:45.128 --> 02:45:48.147
LIAM: Well, Caleb will just tuck it away for a rainy day.

3107
02:45:48.147 --> 02:45:50.064
To be continued.
MATT: Okay.

3108
02:45:50.987 --> 02:45:52.070
Anybody else?

3109
02:45:52.070 --> 02:45:54.443
LAURA: Hey, Fjord?
TRAVIS: What?

3110
02:45:54.443 --> 02:45:56.972
LAURA: Do you want to go work out?

3111
02:45:56.972 --> 02:46:00.929
TRAVIS: Um, do you work out regularly?

3112
02:46:00.929 --> 02:46:02.340
LAURA: Well...

3113
02:46:02.340 --> 02:46:03.831
No.

3114
02:46:03.831 --> 02:46:05.759
But I know that you work out with Beau

3115
02:46:05.759 --> 02:46:08.078
and she's at the library and
I didn't know if you wanted

3116
02:46:08.078 --> 02:46:10.787
to get your workout in, before your fight tonight.

3117
02:46:10.787 --> 02:46:12.995
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure, that would be great.

3118
02:46:12.995 --> 02:46:14.977
I mean, I'm not looking to go into the fight

3119
02:46:14.977 --> 02:46:16.195
tired or anything.

3120
02:46:16.195 --> 02:46:20.595
LAURA: No, no, no, but if want to do something or something,

3121
02:46:20.595 --> 02:46:22.116
I could help?

3122
02:46:22.116 --> 02:46:23.399
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3123
02:46:24.806 --> 02:46:26.076
Lead on, I--

3124
02:46:26.076 --> 02:46:27.853
LAURA: Oh, I'm leading the workout?

3125
02:46:27.853 --> 02:46:29.563
TRAVIS: You said work out with you.

3126
02:46:29.563 --> 02:46:31.331
LAURA: Oh, well, I thought like, you know,

3127
02:46:31.331 --> 02:46:34.102
do you need, like, somebody to spot you?

3128
02:46:34.102 --> 02:46:35.109
Do you lift?

3129
02:46:35.109 --> 02:46:37.757
Do you, do you do, like--
SAM: Do you <i>even</i> lift?

3130
02:46:37.757 --> 02:46:40.240
LAURA: Do you do sit ups?

3131
02:46:40.240 --> 02:46:42.485
You could lay on the floor and
I could hold onto your legs

3132
02:46:42.485 --> 02:46:45.442
and push them and you could work on your core.

3133
02:46:45.442 --> 02:46:48.613
TRAVIS: Right, yeah, it's mostly body weight stuff.

3134
02:46:48.613 --> 02:46:51.271
Did you want to do it with me
or just watch me work out?

3135
02:46:51.271 --> 02:46:53.496
LAURA: Either one, I could help, just whatever.

3136
02:46:53.496 --> 02:46:58.035
TRAVIS: Okay, yeah, I mean, we usually
start by doing 25 push ups.

3137
02:46:58.035 --> 02:47:01.405
LAURA: Okay let's do that, then.
TRAVIS: Okay, you first.

3138
02:47:01.405 --> 02:47:03.845
LAURA: Okay, I do 25 push ups.

3139
02:47:03.845 --> 02:47:05.475
TRAVIS: How fast does she do them?

3140
02:47:05.475 --> 02:47:07.949
MATT: Roll a strength-- oh, this
will be an athletics check.

3141
02:47:07.949 --> 02:47:10.116
Athletics check, please.

3142
02:47:13.677 --> 02:47:14.853
LAURA: Seven.

3143
02:47:14.853 --> 02:47:16.063
MATT: Seven?

3144
02:47:16.063 --> 02:47:18.591
The first 15 are pretty solid,

3145
02:47:18.591 --> 02:47:20.840
20 starts getting a little slow,

3146
02:47:20.840 --> 02:47:25.482
but those last two or three,
it peaks to the arms shaking.

3147
02:47:25.482 --> 02:47:27.223
MARISHA: The worming?
MATT: Yeah, yeah.

3148
02:47:27.223 --> 02:47:28.806
But she gets there.

3149
02:47:30.114 --> 02:47:31.491
TRAVIS: I feel a little better about this.

3150
02:47:31.491 --> 02:47:33.372
All right, I'll try and do 25 push ups.

3151
02:47:33.372 --> 02:47:35.343
MATT: Athletics check.
LIAM: Yeah.

3152
02:47:35.343 --> 02:47:38.794
TRAVIS: Fuck you!
(laughter)

3153
02:47:38.794 --> 02:47:39.811
MATT: Yes!

3154
02:47:39.811 --> 02:47:42.120
LAURA: Is it a one, is it a one?
MATT: Natural one.

3155
02:47:42.120 --> 02:47:44.934
(laughter)

3156
02:47:44.934 --> 02:47:46.958
TALIESIN: Does this mean you immediately get a cramp?

3157
02:47:46.958 --> 02:47:48.348
Is that what will happen?

3158
02:47:48.348 --> 02:47:51.237
MATT: The first three go okay.

3159
02:47:51.237 --> 02:47:52.850
TALIESIN: You are so kind.

3160
02:47:52.850 --> 02:47:56.350
MATT: The fourth one, you hear a pop!

3161
02:47:57.228 --> 02:47:59.399
TRAVIS: Oh, come on, man!

3162
02:47:59.399 --> 02:48:01.276
I have a fight tonight!

3163
02:48:01.276 --> 02:48:03.616
MATT: Yeah, you do. (laughs)

3164
02:48:03.616 --> 02:48:05.085
LAURA: Oh no.

3165
02:48:05.085 --> 02:48:06.222
Oh no, are you okay?

3166
02:48:06.222 --> 02:48:09.961
MATT: The fifth one, he pushes
and he's just holding it,

3167
02:48:09.961 --> 02:48:10.972
and he's shaking.

3168
02:48:10.972 --> 02:48:12.449
LAURA: Are you okay, Fjord?

3169
02:48:12.449 --> 02:48:13.689
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, I'm fine.

3170
02:48:13.689 --> 02:48:17.183
LAURA: Do you do this all the time, what did you do?

3171
02:48:17.183 --> 02:48:19.290
Did you break your rib, what's going on?

3172
02:48:19.290 --> 02:48:21.922
TRAVIS: I feel like this was not sticking out before.

3173
02:48:21.922 --> 02:48:26.570
LAURA: Oh my god, did you get a
hernia from just doing a pushup?

3174
02:48:26.570 --> 02:48:28.362
I thought you were really strong!

3175
02:48:28.362 --> 02:48:30.661
Fjord. I push it back in.

3176
02:48:30.661 --> 02:48:32.910
TRAVIS: No, don't push it back!

3177
02:48:32.910 --> 02:48:34.133
LAURA: I'm going to push it in!

3178
02:48:34.133 --> 02:48:36.264
TRAVIS: No, please, no, stop it!

3179
02:48:36.264 --> 02:48:38.801
Can you do magic, can you make it go away?

3180
02:48:38.801 --> 02:48:40.367
Your little hamster uniforms.

3181
02:48:40.367 --> 02:48:43.866
MATT: Cure Wounds, I will allow
you to heal a hernia.

3182
02:48:43.866 --> 02:48:45.794
TRAVIS: (sighs)
(laughter)

3183
02:48:45.794 --> 02:48:48.270
LIAM: Is that Greater Restoration?

3184
02:48:48.270 --> 02:48:49.874
MATT: Either.
TRAVIS: You know what we didn't do?

3185
02:48:49.874 --> 02:48:52.102
We didn't warm up.

3186
02:48:52.102 --> 02:48:54.333
That's what it was.

3187
02:48:54.333 --> 02:48:56.453
We let ego get in the way, yep.

3188
02:48:56.453 --> 02:48:58.511
SAM: Stretch.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3189
02:48:58.511 --> 02:49:01.583
TRAVIS: So I think maybe that's good for today.

3190
02:49:01.583 --> 02:49:03.092
LAURA: Oh, that's it, huh?

3191
02:49:03.092 --> 02:49:05.614
25-- five pushups.

3192
02:49:05.614 --> 02:49:08.873
Four, maybe, three pushups.

3193
02:49:08.873 --> 02:49:11.998
That's a good warmup for tonight.

3194
02:49:13.234 --> 02:49:15.156
SAM: Four and a half pushups.

3195
02:49:15.156 --> 02:49:17.483
TRAVIS: I feel like my pride is hurt.

3196
02:49:17.483 --> 02:49:20.584
LAURA: No, no, no, no, you were really strong.

3197
02:49:20.584 --> 02:49:22.142
That was impressive?

3198
02:49:22.142 --> 02:49:24.533
TRAVIS: I've done more than that.
LAURA: I believe you.

3199
02:49:24.533 --> 02:49:26.700
I super duper believe you.

3200
02:49:28.394 --> 02:49:32.973
TRAVIS: I don't feel like you do,
but I have come a long way.

3201
02:49:32.973 --> 02:49:34.482
It's really...

3202
02:49:34.482 --> 02:49:36.652
LAURA: You're going to do so good tonight.

3203
02:49:36.652 --> 02:49:37.485
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

3204
02:49:38.319 --> 02:49:40.040
Whew, maybe I should back out.

3205
02:49:40.040 --> 02:49:42.068
LAURA: No, no, no, do it, Fjord!

3206
02:49:42.068 --> 02:49:44.418
You're really strong and, well,

3207
02:49:44.418 --> 02:49:48.108
you're doing it with a weapon, right?

3208
02:49:48.108 --> 02:49:50.557
TRAVIS: Why, do you think that's important?

3209
02:49:51.557 --> 02:49:55.500
LAURA: Yeah.
(laughter)

3210
02:49:55.500 --> 02:49:59.060
Just because, you know, Beau's
going to be doing it without

3211
02:49:59.060 --> 02:50:02.602
and Yasha and both of them are like...

3212
02:50:05.100 --> 02:50:06.717
TRAVIS: Both of them are like...?

3213
02:50:06.717 --> 02:50:08.265
LAURA: Brawly.

3214
02:50:08.265 --> 02:50:09.098
TRAVIS: Brawly?

3215
02:50:09.098 --> 02:50:12.599
LAURA: Like really good with their fists and stuff.

3216
02:50:12.599 --> 02:50:15.930
You can try, do you want to punch me and practice?

3217
02:50:15.930 --> 02:50:17.671
TRAVIS: No, no, I don't.

3218
02:50:17.671 --> 02:50:19.183
I signed up for the weapon one.

3219
02:50:19.183 --> 02:50:22.015
LAURA: Okay, well good, that's good.

3220
02:50:22.015 --> 02:50:24.414
TRAVIS: Good thing I did.
LAURA: It's going to be good, Fjord.

3221
02:50:24.414 --> 02:50:27.177
TRAVIS: (sighs) I got the failure out of the way first,

3222
02:50:27.177 --> 02:50:29.265
can't do it twice in one day.
LAURA: (laughs) Exactly.

3223
02:50:29.265 --> 02:50:30.262
TRAVIS: Right, yeah.

3224
02:50:30.262 --> 02:50:33.518
LAURA: And hey, you have that pec thing you can do!

3225
02:50:33.518 --> 02:50:35.277
TRAVIS: It's not moving on one side.

3226
02:50:35.277 --> 02:50:36.661
(Marisha laughs)

3227
02:50:36.661 --> 02:50:38.349
There's a little atrophy going on.

3228
02:50:38.349 --> 02:50:41.080
A lot of serotonin coursing through me right now.

3229
02:50:41.080 --> 02:50:45.491
LAURA: Just rest before tonight,
I'm sorry I did that, I'm sorry.

3230
02:50:45.491 --> 02:50:50.123
TRAVIS: No, it's all right, it's my fault. (clears throat)

3231
02:50:50.123 --> 02:50:53.173
LAURA: The Traveler is with you.

3232
02:50:53.173 --> 02:50:55.166
And the Wildmother, too! Good for you!

3233
02:50:55.166 --> 02:50:57.961
You've got two of them on your side, you're great!

3234
02:50:57.961 --> 02:51:01.134
TRAVIS: Does the Traveler interface
with the Wildmother a lot?

3235
02:51:01.134 --> 02:51:04.683
Is there an established relationship there?

3236
02:51:05.970 --> 02:51:07.594
LAURA: Yeah!

3237
02:51:07.594 --> 02:51:09.631
They totally like each other, all the time.

3238
02:51:09.631 --> 02:51:11.048
They go on dates.

3239
02:51:12.261 --> 02:51:14.642
TRAVIS: They go on dates?

3240
02:51:14.642 --> 02:51:16.157
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: Roll a religion check.

3241
02:51:16.157 --> 02:51:17.517
(laughter)

3242
02:51:17.517 --> 02:51:20.275
SAM: They go on dates.
(laughter)

3243
02:51:20.275 --> 02:51:21.967
TRAVIS: 20.

3244
02:51:21.967 --> 02:51:26.884
MATT: Wildmother, one, already in a
relationship with Erathis.

3245
02:51:28.888 --> 02:51:30.018
Both ladies.

3246
02:51:30.018 --> 02:51:35.018
TRAVIS: Yeah, I don't know that that's accurate.

3247
02:51:35.111 --> 02:51:37.861
But I will think on it and see what...

3248
02:51:39.494 --> 02:51:41.179
comes through.

3249
02:51:41.179 --> 02:51:42.839
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3250
02:51:42.839 --> 02:51:45.837
TRAVIS: The Traveler, right, hm.

3251
02:51:45.837 --> 02:51:47.850
LAURA: You don't know his fucking name, Fjord?

3252
02:51:47.850 --> 02:51:49.210
TRAVIS: Of course I know his name,

3253
02:51:49.210 --> 02:51:50.532
I just think it's odd that he's telling you

3254
02:51:50.532 --> 02:51:53.829
they went on dates when that's not what I understand.

3255
02:51:53.829 --> 02:51:55.258
LAURA: Well, the Traveler
doesn't have to tell me that.

3256
02:51:55.258 --> 02:51:57.347
I just know everybody wants
to go on dates with him

3257
02:51:57.347 --> 02:51:59.264
because he's super cool.

3258
02:52:00.640 --> 02:52:02.418
TRAVIS: Does he date a lot?

3259
02:52:02.418 --> 02:52:03.949
LAURA: He gets around.

3260
02:52:03.949 --> 02:52:04.782
TRAVIS: Oh.

3261
02:52:06.090 --> 02:52:07.877
Bit of a floozy.

3262
02:52:07.877 --> 02:52:11.678
LAURA: No, just sought after, you know what I mean?

3263
02:52:11.678 --> 02:52:13.650
TRAVIS: Not really, deities that are hooking up

3264
02:52:13.650 --> 02:52:18.288
all over the place, it's pretty new to me, concept-wise.

3265
02:52:18.288 --> 02:52:19.981
LIAM: Is The Traveler a fuckboi?

3266
02:52:19.981 --> 02:52:22.680
(laughter)

3267
02:52:22.680 --> 02:52:26.400
MATT: Eat your heart out, Zeus.
(laughter)

3268
02:52:26.400 --> 02:52:28.150
LAURA: Just saying.
TRAVIS: Okay.

3269
02:52:29.285 --> 02:52:31.901
Well, uh, wish me luck.

3270
02:52:31.901 --> 02:52:33.050
LAURA: Good luck.

3271
02:52:33.050 --> 02:52:34.487
TRAVIS: Thank you for the workout.

3272
02:52:34.487 --> 02:52:37.088
LAURA: (chuckles)

3273
02:52:37.088 --> 02:52:38.980
TRAVIS: Do you feel tired at least,
are you sore?

3274
02:52:38.980 --> 02:52:41.588
LAURA: I'm so exhausted. I am shaking,

3275
02:52:41.588 --> 02:52:43.263
I'm going to be sore tomorrow.
TRAVIS: Is she sweating at all,

3276
02:52:43.263 --> 02:52:45.229
even the slightest bit?

3277
02:52:46.474 --> 02:52:51.224
I appreciate you saying that
you are, even if you're not.

3278
02:52:52.701 --> 02:52:55.021
LAURA: This got so awkward.

3279
02:52:55.021 --> 02:52:56.642
MATT: (laughs)
TALIESIN: I'm so proud.

3280
02:52:56.642 --> 02:52:58.892
SAM: Good workout, kids.

3281
02:52:58.892 --> 02:53:03.369
TRAVIS: Glad I could save some face in front of Jester.

3282
02:53:03.369 --> 02:53:06.448
MATT: All righty. (laughs)

3283
02:53:06.448 --> 02:53:09.440
Anybody else want to do anything?

3284
02:53:09.440 --> 02:53:10.273
Please?

3285
02:53:10.273 --> 02:53:15.250
ASHLEY: When I wake up, I would
like to take a very large

3286
02:53:15.250 --> 02:53:19.000
cup of coffee or whatever is the morning fuel

3287
02:53:20.320 --> 02:53:22.901
and go back out to the garden,
sit up against the tree

3288
02:53:22.901 --> 02:53:25.128
and read until the fight.

3289
02:53:25.128 --> 02:53:26.877
MATT: Okay, so you're just like--?

3290
02:53:26.877 --> 02:53:29.102
(pants frantically)

3291
02:53:29.102 --> 02:53:31.326
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MATT: All right, cool.

3292
02:53:31.326 --> 02:53:34.617
That'll put you at about full day of reading,

3293
02:53:34.617 --> 02:53:38.759
we'll say with a couple of breaks
there, an additional...

3294
02:53:40.755 --> 02:53:43.897
10 or so hours before you

3295
02:53:45.550 --> 02:53:48.032
have to begin getting ready to head on over

3296
02:53:48.032 --> 02:53:50.150
to the evening's event.

3297
02:53:50.150 --> 02:53:52.900
ASHLEY: Okay, so 31 hours I've read it.

3298
02:53:53.918 --> 02:53:56.337
Okay, I'm getting there.

3299
02:53:56.337 --> 02:53:57.830
MATT: All righty.

3300
02:53:57.830 --> 02:54:01.907
Anyone else, or are we moving on
to the evening's event?

3301
02:54:01.907 --> 02:54:04.673
SAM: Let's go to the evening.
MATT: Okay.

3302
02:54:04.673 --> 02:54:05.506
So!

3303
02:54:06.533 --> 02:54:08.866
As nightfall takes the city,

3304
02:54:09.873 --> 02:54:12.873
you gather yourselves and begin walking

3305
02:54:12.873 --> 02:54:17.353
to the Mudtop Ward of Rexxentrum

3306
02:54:17.353 --> 02:54:22.186
to find the butcher shop that
had previously been scouted.

3307
02:54:23.164 --> 02:54:26.732
King's Cut is closed,
but as you're approaching,

3308
02:54:26.732 --> 02:54:30.031
you still see the occasional individual walk up

3309
02:54:30.031 --> 02:54:31.531
and be let inside.

3310
02:54:33.633 --> 02:54:36.630
You eventually make your way,
same thing, knock on the door,

3311
02:54:36.630 --> 02:54:39.572
are let in by another one of
the employees of the butchery

3312
02:54:39.572 --> 02:54:42.369
and as they lead you inside, they're like,

3313
02:54:43.361 --> 02:54:46.702
"Sorry, we're closed for the night."

3314
02:54:46.702 --> 02:54:47.869
TRAVIS: Oh, no, yes.

3315
02:54:49.366 --> 02:54:51.454
ASHLEY: Yes, uh, uh...

3316
02:54:51.454 --> 02:54:53.371
We came here for the...

3317
02:54:54.709 --> 02:54:55.896
Shit.

3318
02:54:55.896 --> 02:54:59.413
The special cut of-- we have some--

3319
02:54:59.413 --> 02:55:01.268
a cut in the back.

3320
02:55:01.268 --> 02:55:02.338
What?

3321
02:55:02.338 --> 02:55:04.134
(laughter)

3322
02:55:04.134 --> 02:55:06.597
There's something in the back for us.

3323
02:55:06.597 --> 02:55:09.180
(laughter)

3324
02:55:10.165 --> 02:55:12.085
We have a, we have a--

3325
02:55:12.085 --> 02:55:13.882
LIAM: Are we eating in here?

3326
02:55:13.882 --> 02:55:16.801
TALIESIN: I can't eat any of this.

3327
02:55:16.801 --> 02:55:18.201
ASHLEY: We have a...

3328
02:55:20.860 --> 02:55:23.260
Cut of meat in the back,

3329
02:55:23.260 --> 02:55:25.935
downstairs that we have,

3330
02:55:25.935 --> 02:55:27.026
for us,

3331
02:55:27.026 --> 02:55:29.101
that we are partaking in.

3332
02:55:30.179 --> 02:55:32.569
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

3333
02:55:32.569 --> 02:55:33.708
ASHLEY: Shit.

3334
02:55:33.708 --> 02:55:36.458
MATT: (laughs)

3335
02:55:37.788 --> 02:55:38.773
ASHLEY: Seven.

3336
02:55:38.773 --> 02:55:40.014
LAURA: Oh!

3337
02:55:40.014 --> 02:55:41.729
MATT: The employee goes,

3338
02:55:41.729 --> 02:55:43.711
"Ah...

3339
02:55:43.711 --> 02:55:46.671
"I'm sorry, we're closed for the night.

3340
02:55:46.671 --> 02:55:48.099
"You'll have to come back tomorrow."

3341
02:55:48.099 --> 02:55:50.840
ASHLEY: No, this is, uh--
this is-- uh, this is--

3342
02:55:50.840 --> 02:55:53.398
actually, is Jacquel here?

3343
02:55:53.398 --> 02:55:55.579
MATT: "She's closing up in the back."

3344
02:55:55.579 --> 02:55:57.859
ASHLEY: Would you mind actually sending her out?

3345
02:55:57.859 --> 02:56:01.859
Because it's very important
that we speak to her.

3346
02:56:01.859 --> 02:56:05.869
MATT: She's busy at the moment, I'm sorry.

3347
02:56:05.869 --> 02:56:08.090
TRAVIS: Champion special cut?

3348
02:56:08.090 --> 02:56:11.512
ASHLEY: The champion special cut.

3349
02:56:11.512 --> 02:56:14.350
It's a cut, a very special champion's cut.

3350
02:56:14.350 --> 02:56:15.880
SAM: I'm just going to leave.

3351
02:56:15.880 --> 02:56:18.163
(laughter)

3352
02:56:18.163 --> 02:56:20.019
I'm going to go outside and walk around a bit.

3353
02:56:20.019 --> 02:56:22.718
Until they figure this out.
(laughing)

3354
02:56:22.718 --> 02:56:25.777
MATT: After a loud sigh, opens
the door and lets you guys in.

3355
02:56:25.777 --> 02:56:26.866
(laughter)

3356
02:56:26.866 --> 02:56:28.973
TALIESIN: Oh, that was amazing.
MATT: Closed behind.

3357
02:56:28.973 --> 02:56:32.333
You are then ushered beyond the doorway

3358
02:56:32.333 --> 02:56:34.416
that led into the office,

3359
02:56:36.265 --> 02:56:40.494
of Jacquel, beyond the butcher block counter

3360
02:56:40.494 --> 02:56:44.264
where most of the customers interface with

3361
02:56:44.264 --> 02:56:45.966
and make their purchases

3362
02:56:45.966 --> 02:56:49.475
to a storage hallway to the back.

3363
02:56:49.475 --> 02:56:52.446
You're led through and
there's another employee there

3364
02:56:52.446 --> 02:56:55.595
who's waiting and is currently
standing in front of a door.

3365
02:56:55.595 --> 02:56:58.096
As you approach, the first
employee gives a nod.

3366
02:56:58.096 --> 02:57:00.998
The second one nods back,
opens the storage door

3367
02:57:00.998 --> 02:57:02.587
and then as opposed to being a closet,

3368
02:57:02.587 --> 02:57:05.466
there is a staircase that leads down.

3369
02:57:05.466 --> 02:57:09.568
You guys can already
hear chatter and laughter,

3370
02:57:09.568 --> 02:57:13.475
and as you head down the staircase within,

3371
02:57:13.475 --> 02:57:16.304
and as it opens up,
immediately see to the right

3372
02:57:16.304 --> 02:57:19.471
and left of you, two shelves of liquor

3373
02:57:20.353 --> 02:57:22.789
with tables on each side, with food and snacks

3374
02:57:22.789 --> 02:57:25.769
already laid out and prepared
with two other employees

3375
02:57:25.769 --> 02:57:29.469
that are in the process of
gathering elements on plates.

3376
02:57:30.849 --> 02:57:33.950
In front of you, across the way, you see

3377
02:57:33.950 --> 02:57:36.833
there's a small wall, two little outcroppings,

3378
02:57:36.833 --> 02:57:39.049
and spiral staircases that curl up

3379
02:57:39.049 --> 02:57:41.347
to a secondary floor on each side.

3380
02:57:41.347 --> 02:57:44.377
Immediately across from you are iron bars

3381
02:57:44.377 --> 02:57:47.598
that go across and separate
this small area,

3382
02:57:47.598 --> 02:57:52.103
this entryway from an
open square fighting pit

3383
02:57:52.103 --> 02:57:55.619
that is just scattered in
rock and dust and gravel.

3384
02:57:56.536 --> 02:58:00.446
The doors open, you see there
are two guards to each side

3385
02:58:00.446 --> 02:58:04.017
and one white-robed figure
who's in the process right now

3386
02:58:04.017 --> 02:58:06.798
of sitting and having a drink
and just sitting cross-legged

3387
02:58:06.798 --> 02:58:09.798
on the ground, notices you as you arrive.

3388
02:58:09.798 --> 02:58:12.817
There are torch lights flickering

3389
02:58:12.817 --> 02:58:15.718
and you can see these
staircases that spiral upward.

3390
02:58:15.718 --> 02:58:17.968
There are separate,

3391
02:58:19.145 --> 02:58:23.406
balcony chambers that are
open and overlook this battlefield

3392
02:58:23.406 --> 02:58:26.283
where there are, probably,
you'd guess at this point,

3393
02:58:26.283 --> 02:58:29.187
close to a dozen figures
that are up there, sitting,

3394
02:58:29.187 --> 02:58:33.444
eating food, talking, watching
or waiting for the battle

3395
02:58:33.444 --> 02:58:36.561
to commence as their entertainment
for the evening.

3396
02:58:38.914 --> 02:58:40.573
As you guys walk into this space--

3397
02:58:40.573 --> 02:58:42.813
MARISHA: About how many people?

3398
02:58:42.813 --> 02:58:44.000
MATT: That are sitting up there?

3399
02:58:44.000 --> 02:58:46.218
We'll say about a dozen, maybe,
a little under a dozen.

3400
02:58:46.218 --> 02:58:47.655
MARISHA: Okay.

3401
02:58:47.655 --> 02:58:52.238
MATT: It's not a huge crowd, but
for given a day's worth of

3402
02:58:53.290 --> 02:58:55.736
time to prepare for this, it's not bad either,

3403
02:58:55.736 --> 02:58:57.034
given the scenario.

3404
02:58:57.034 --> 02:58:58.784
MARISHA: Do they look fancy?

3405
02:59:00.345 --> 02:59:02.056
MATT: Some of them look pretty fancy.

3406
02:59:02.056 --> 02:59:03.803
Some of them look moderate.

3407
02:59:03.803 --> 02:59:05.896
You can't really tell from down here.

3408
02:59:05.896 --> 02:59:08.475
You do see off to the side on one end,

3409
02:59:08.475 --> 02:59:12.215
there are two figures that
are currently stretching.

3410
02:59:12.215 --> 02:59:13.957
TRAVIS: That's important.

3411
02:59:13.957 --> 02:59:17.357
(laughter)

3412
02:59:17.357 --> 02:59:20.056
MATT: You see one gentleman,

3413
02:59:20.056 --> 02:59:24.147
who looks to be half-elven,

3414
02:59:24.147 --> 02:59:27.008
older, maybe in his late 50s,

3415
02:59:27.008 --> 02:59:30.788
very sun-wrinkled skin from a lifetime

3416
02:59:30.788 --> 02:59:33.205
of probably working outdoors.

3417
02:59:34.634 --> 02:59:38.537
Light brown hair that's actually lighter than skin tone.

3418
02:59:38.537 --> 02:59:42.318
A bit of a beard, as much as a half-elf can muster.

3419
02:59:42.318 --> 02:59:45.519
You can see a lot of effort went
into trying to cultivate this beard.

3420
02:59:46.561 --> 02:59:48.484
And has hand wraps around the fingers

3421
02:59:48.484 --> 02:59:52.201
and is currently in the process of air punching a bit.

3422
02:59:53.846 --> 02:59:55.163
Preparing themselves for a bout.

3423
02:59:55.163 --> 02:59:57.574
You gather this is one of the contestants.

3424
02:59:57.574 --> 03:00:01.475
You see the other one is a
real rough and tumble looking

3425
03:00:01.475 --> 03:00:05.345
female dwarf who is currently
sitting in a chair

3426
03:00:05.345 --> 03:00:07.865
and giving herself a shoulder
massage with one hand

3427
03:00:07.865 --> 03:00:10.422
and the other hand is
just drinking this tankard.

3428
03:00:10.422 --> 03:00:13.330
She's got this scruffy,

3429
03:00:16.342 --> 03:00:18.950
mutton chops that come down
the side of her face.

3430
03:00:18.950 --> 03:00:20.942
Her nose, you can see
has broken multiple times,

3431
03:00:20.942 --> 03:00:23.020
and has healed back to
the point where now it's just

3432
03:00:23.020 --> 03:00:26.637
this very character-like nose.

3433
03:00:28.500 --> 03:00:32.782
The hair is mostly red, but
you see a bit of gray streak

3434
03:00:32.782 --> 03:00:37.782
coming through it and it is
tied into a top knot bun.

3435
03:00:37.820 --> 03:00:40.939
Something similar to that design
in the back of the head.

3436
03:00:40.939 --> 03:00:44.561
Arms are thick, just battering rams.

3437
03:00:44.561 --> 03:00:46.539
Then you can see all sorts of scars.

3438
03:00:46.539 --> 03:00:49.806
She's wearing a leather tank top,
it looks like,

3439
03:00:49.806 --> 03:00:52.196
element there, not thick enough
to be considered armor,

3440
03:00:52.196 --> 03:00:55.505
but enough to just be a stylistic
piece of battle gear

3441
03:00:55.505 --> 03:00:59.897
and just scars and patches
of hair around the scars,

3442
03:00:59.897 --> 03:01:04.116
the shoulders and arms and
she's just drinking.

3443
03:01:04.116 --> 03:01:06.641
MARISHA: That's got to be Kal, right?

3444
03:01:06.641 --> 03:01:08.422
MATT: Could be.
TRAVIS: I think so.

3445
03:01:08.422 --> 03:01:11.923
MATT: To the other side, you see a man,

3446
03:01:11.923 --> 03:01:14.782
looks maybe in his 30s or so.

3447
03:01:14.782 --> 03:01:17.311
Tall, dark skin, jet black hair,

3448
03:01:17.311 --> 03:01:19.381
long, it's braided in the back

3449
03:01:19.381 --> 03:01:23.473
and goes just to past his waist,
wearing scale mail.

3450
03:01:24.528 --> 03:01:26.690
He has a shield in one hand
and a battleaxe in the other

3451
03:01:26.690 --> 03:01:28.798
and he's practicing in the air

3452
03:01:28.798 --> 03:01:32.157
before he turns and watches you guys enter.

3453
03:01:32.157 --> 03:01:34.324
He gives a nod and a look.

3454
03:01:36.298 --> 03:01:37.465
"Wait a second!

3455
03:01:39.207 --> 03:01:41.565
"(laughs) I know you guys!"

3456
03:01:41.565 --> 03:01:43.412
LAURA: (gasps)

3457
03:01:44.295 --> 03:01:49.133
MATT: "In the, uh, the Harvest Close festival!"

3458
03:01:49.133 --> 03:01:50.653
"The pit fight.

3459
03:01:50.653 --> 03:01:52.194
"We won, we won!"

3460
03:01:52.194 --> 03:01:53.503
LAURA: Yeah!
MARISHA: Oh!

3461
03:01:53.503 --> 03:01:55.415
MATT: (laughs)

3462
03:01:55.415 --> 03:01:59.340
MARISHA: You were-- hang on, I've been
looking at this a lot here.

3463
03:01:59.340 --> 03:02:01.007
MATT: "You're the, the...

3464
03:02:02.047 --> 03:02:03.630
"The Super Seven!"

3465
03:02:05.315 --> 03:02:07.754
LAURA: The Mighty Nein!
MARISHA: Close.

3466
03:02:07.754 --> 03:02:09.924
ASHLEY: Which one were you?
MARISHA: Hang on.

3467
03:02:09.924 --> 03:02:11.385
MATT: "I'm Darrow, Darrow Allocke.

3468
03:02:11.385 --> 03:02:13.766
"I'm the leader of the Stubborn Stock.

3469
03:02:13.766 --> 03:02:15.752
"We both went head to head at the end,

3470
03:02:15.752 --> 03:02:17.679
"but we both managed to take out our creatures

3471
03:02:17.679 --> 03:02:19.748
"and we shared the pot and it was amazing."

3472
03:02:19.748 --> 03:02:22.466
ASHLEY: We fought a very large crocodile together.

3473
03:02:22.466 --> 03:02:23.719
TALIESIN: Ah.

3474
03:02:23.719 --> 03:02:25.302
ASHLEY: Yeah, I remember.

3475
03:02:26.319 --> 03:02:28.101
I remember you.

3476
03:02:28.101 --> 03:02:30.365
MARISHA: Wait, is he in white robes?

3477
03:02:30.365 --> 03:02:33.074
MATT: No, scale mail.
MARISHA: He's scale mail.

3478
03:02:33.074 --> 03:02:34.657
LAURA: With long hair.

3479
03:02:36.013 --> 03:02:37.701
ASHLEY: The panther beasts.

3480
03:02:37.701 --> 03:02:38.989
Ah, somethin'.

3481
03:02:38.989 --> 03:02:40.448
MATT: (laughs)

3482
03:02:40.448 --> 03:02:44.389
MATT: He's like, "Sure, all right, yeah, no.

3483
03:02:44.389 --> 03:02:47.799
"You're looking good, things have been well?"

3484
03:02:47.799 --> 03:02:50.674
TRAVIS: Yes, no, we've been traveling a lot, you?

3485
03:02:50.674 --> 03:02:53.815
MATT: "Well, for a while, yeah,
we were doing some mercenary work

3486
03:02:53.815 --> 03:02:56.376
"around here in the Empire,
it's paying really well now,

3487
03:02:56.376 --> 03:02:58.860
"since the war started up, you know."

3488
03:03:00.600 --> 03:03:02.020
TRAVIS: A lot of stuff into Xhorhas?

3489
03:03:02.020 --> 03:03:03.759
Or have you been on other borders?

3490
03:03:03.759 --> 03:03:06.516
MATT: "No, no, just doing
bodyguard work and local stuff."

3491
03:03:06.516 --> 03:03:08.196
"I don't want to get involved in the war.

3492
03:03:08.196 --> 03:03:11.487
"I'm not about to become a sacrificial pawn."

3493
03:03:11.487 --> 03:03:13.398
TRAVIS: Sure, yeah.

3494
03:03:13.398 --> 03:03:14.796
MATT: "I'm Menagerie Coast all along."

3495
03:03:14.796 --> 03:03:16.679
TRAVIS: Yeah, are you fighting tonight?

3496
03:03:16.679 --> 03:03:18.641
MATT: "Yeah, yeah, you guys coming to watch?"

3497
03:03:18.641 --> 03:03:21.171
TRAVIS: Some of us are participating, actually.

3498
03:03:21.171 --> 03:03:23.000
MATT: "Oh, no way!"

3499
03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:25.088
TRAVIS: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Yes way.

3500
03:03:25.088 --> 03:03:26.568
MATT: "Well, who's fighting what?"

3501
03:03:26.568 --> 03:03:29.563
LAURA: I think Fjord might be
fighting you, actually.

3502
03:03:29.563 --> 03:03:30.646
MATT: (laughs)

3503
03:03:30.646 --> 03:03:33.318
And he goes and he gives out a big hand.

3504
03:03:33.318 --> 03:03:34.678
TRAVIS: Does it hurt?

3505
03:03:34.678 --> 03:03:37.097
MATT: Roll a strength check.

3506
03:03:37.097 --> 03:03:39.185
Why is it all about stats?

3507
03:03:39.185 --> 03:03:40.991
TRAVIS: Fuck you. Seven.

3508
03:03:40.991 --> 03:03:42.240
MATT: Seven.
LAURA: Oh no!

3509
03:03:42.240 --> 03:03:43.720
MATT: Doesn't hurt as much, because
he rolled a natural one.

3510
03:03:43.720 --> 03:03:47.094
TRAVIS: Woo!
(laughter)

3511
03:03:47.094 --> 03:03:49.279
MATT: "Oh, you got a grip there, my friend.

3512
03:03:49.279 --> 03:03:53.578
"That is very... (chuckles)"

3513
03:03:53.578 --> 03:03:55.679
TRAVIS: Well, I look forward to the tune up with you.

3514
03:03:55.679 --> 03:03:57.579
This will be most fun.

3515
03:03:57.579 --> 03:03:59.668
MATT: "I agree, I agree, yeah.

3516
03:03:59.668 --> 03:04:03.192
"It's good to see you guys. Anyway, I got to stretch.

3517
03:04:04.167 --> 03:04:06.158
"(laughs)

3518
03:04:06.158 --> 03:04:08.638
"And, uh, hey, good luck."

3519
03:04:08.638 --> 03:04:09.471
TRAVIS: Same to you.

3520
03:04:09.471 --> 03:04:12.657
MATT: "Dawnfather look over you, friend."

3521
03:04:12.657 --> 03:04:15.365
TRAVIS: Dawnfather, yep.
MARISHA: That's three for you, man!

3522
03:04:15.365 --> 03:04:17.347
TRAVIS: What do you mean, three what?

3523
03:04:17.347 --> 03:04:19.851
MARISHA: Oh, I don't even know,
never mind--

3524
03:04:19.851 --> 03:04:22.659
TRAVIS: Three what?
(laughter)

3525
03:04:22.659 --> 03:04:25.165
MARISHA: Three gods, don't worry about it, I wasn't there.

3526
03:04:25.165 --> 03:04:27.336
MATT: Jacquel, by the way,
after this conversation, approaches

3527
03:04:27.336 --> 03:04:30.105
from down one of the sides and goes like,

3528
03:04:30.105 --> 03:04:31.433
"Oh, hello there, you made it!

3529
03:04:31.433 --> 03:04:33.353
"I'm so glad you all could finally come along.

3530
03:04:33.353 --> 03:04:36.321
"We were hoping you all would show up, eh?"

3531
03:04:36.321 --> 03:04:38.926
LAURA: We had a hard time getting in.

3532
03:04:38.926 --> 03:04:40.885
MATT: "That's all right."
ASHLEY: Yeah, that was my fault.

3533
03:04:40.885 --> 03:04:43.526
I forgot what the cut was.

3534
03:04:43.526 --> 03:04:44.894
MATT: "It's all right, there's plenty of alcohol,

3535
03:04:44.894 --> 03:04:47.728
"everyone's happy to wait and get nice and toasty.

3536
03:04:47.728 --> 03:04:50.025
"The pot's put in, quite a bit of money

3537
03:04:50.025 --> 03:04:53.088
"to possibly win tonight,
so let's see if we can do it.

3538
03:04:53.088 --> 03:04:54.331
"We ready, need some time?

3539
03:04:54.331 --> 03:04:55.698
"Let me know when we're good to go ahead

3540
03:04:55.698 --> 03:04:56.851
"and get the first bout going."

3541
03:04:56.851 --> 03:04:59.380
LAURA: Ooh ooh ooh, can I bet on people?

3542
03:04:59.380 --> 03:05:01.340
TALIESIN: You can do that?

3543
03:05:01.340 --> 03:05:02.395
LIAM: I would like to wager.

3544
03:05:02.395 --> 03:05:04.177
MATT: "I'm certainly down for some wagers."

3545
03:05:04.177 --> 03:05:05.283
TALIESIN: Sure.

3546
03:05:05.283 --> 03:05:08.398
MATT: "Okay, okay, how much you want to wager?"

3547
03:05:08.398 --> 03:05:10.947
LIAM: I would like to, uh...

3548
03:05:10.947 --> 03:05:12.843
the three of you, you said?

3549
03:05:12.843 --> 03:05:13.676
MARISHA: Yeah.

3550
03:05:13.676 --> 03:05:16.780
LIAM: I would like to wager 100 gold
on each of my friends.

3551
03:05:16.780 --> 03:05:17.925
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, me too, that sounds good.

3552
03:05:17.925 --> 03:05:19.611
LAURA: Yeah, same, same.

3553
03:05:19.611 --> 03:05:21.119
MARISHA: Oh, you guys are so supportive.

3554
03:05:21.119 --> 03:05:23.271
I hope I don't fucking let them down.

3555
03:05:23.271 --> 03:05:25.231
LIAM: That's why I'm doing an even spread.

3556
03:05:25.231 --> 03:05:27.038
TRAVIS: No guarantees.

3557
03:05:27.038 --> 03:05:28.508
MARISHA: Oh, so if one of us fails.

3558
03:05:28.508 --> 03:05:30.946
LAURA: I'm going to do even spread,
except for the Beau fight.

3559
03:05:30.946 --> 03:05:34.268
I'm going to add another 20 for the Beau.

3560
03:05:34.268 --> 03:05:36.397
LIAM: You're my ringer.
MATT: Okay, so for--

3561
03:05:36.397 --> 03:05:38.686
TALIESIN: 120 for Beau and 100 for the other two.

3562
03:05:38.686 --> 03:05:39.910
MATT: I got you.
MARISHA: Make us some good money.

3563
03:05:39.910 --> 03:05:43.119
TALIESIN: 100 for me each.
MARISHA: Make us some good money.

3564
03:05:43.119 --> 03:05:47.730
Hey, can I give you some money
to bet on myself?

3565
03:05:47.730 --> 03:05:49.208
TRAVIS: Make sure you get your rage.

3566
03:05:49.208 --> 03:05:52.838
MARISHA: Okay, I slip him
some money under the side

3567
03:05:52.838 --> 03:05:55.219
to put it on a bet for myself,
on myself.

3568
03:05:55.219 --> 03:05:56.808
LIAM: How much was it?
MARISHA: Another 100 gold.

3569
03:05:56.808 --> 03:05:58.458
LIAM: One.

3570
03:05:58.458 --> 03:05:59.680
MARISHA: What?
LIAM: Two.

3571
03:05:59.680 --> 03:06:03.021
MARISHA: Oh, Jesus Christ!
LIAM: Three.

3572
03:06:03.021 --> 03:06:06.970
LIAM: 10 minutes later, I bet
another 100 gold on Beauregard.

3573
03:06:06.970 --> 03:06:08.049
MATT: In addition to the 100 she gave you?

3574
03:06:08.049 --> 03:06:10.365
LIAM: So 200 on Beau, because she just slipped me

3575
03:06:10.365 --> 03:06:13.477
some of her money, and a 100 on the other two.

3576
03:06:13.477 --> 03:06:15.906
MATT: All right, got you, okay. Anybody else?

3577
03:06:15.906 --> 03:06:17.286
TALIESIN: Got my 100 on each.

3578
03:06:17.286 --> 03:06:19.361
SAM: I'm slipping out and leaving.
LAURA: (gasps)

3579
03:06:19.361 --> 03:06:21.536
LIAM: 99.
LAURA: You're not going to stay and watch?

3580
03:06:21.536 --> 03:06:22.592
SAM: Nah.

3581
03:06:22.592 --> 03:06:24.802
LAURA: Do any of us see you go?

3582
03:06:24.802 --> 03:06:28.451
MATT: If you don't want to be seen,
you can roll a stealth check.

3583
03:06:28.451 --> 03:06:29.868
SAM: With advantage.

3584
03:06:31.676 --> 03:06:32.509
23.

3585
03:06:32.509 --> 03:06:34.142
MATT: Nott is gone.

3586
03:06:35.040 --> 03:06:36.841
TALIESIN: Even with my passive?
MARISHA: Pulling some Vax shit.

3587
03:06:36.841 --> 03:06:38.410
MATT: What's your passive perception?

3588
03:06:38.410 --> 03:06:40.485
TALIESIN: My passive perception is...

3589
03:06:40.485 --> 03:06:42.302
not high enough.
MATT: Nope, didn't think so.

3590
03:06:42.302 --> 03:06:43.830
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3591
03:06:43.830 --> 03:06:46.302
MATT: Nott just-- (gentle wind)
TALIESIN: 19.

3592
03:06:46.302 --> 03:06:49.607
MATT: Just Irish goodbyes,
ghosts out of there.

3593
03:06:49.607 --> 03:06:50.565
TRAVIS: Irish goodbyes.

3594
03:06:50.565 --> 03:06:52.528
LIAM: Where's she goin'?

3595
03:06:52.528 --> 03:06:54.021
SAM: Not far.
LIAM: Where is she goin'?

3596
03:06:54.021 --> 03:06:54.854
MATT: Okay.

3597
03:06:56.032 --> 03:07:00.840
All right, so, with all of those
put in, Jacquel goes,

3598
03:07:00.840 --> 03:07:02.977
"All right, go ahead and find
yourselves a seat up there.

3599
03:07:02.977 --> 03:07:05.588
"We can go ahead and get some food snacks already provided

3600
03:07:05.588 --> 03:07:07.340
"and we'll go get this rolling right quick."

3601
03:07:07.340 --> 03:07:08.240
LAURA: ♪ Give me the snacks ♪

3602
03:07:08.240 --> 03:07:10.498
♪ I want to eat some snacks ♪
TALIESIN: Veggie chips, or--

3603
03:07:10.498 --> 03:07:11.441
LIAM: She's gone.

3604
03:07:11.441 --> 03:07:13.434
MATT: To give you guys an overview of what it looks like.

3605
03:07:13.434 --> 03:07:16.034
ALL: Yeah!

3606
03:07:17.271 --> 03:07:20.372
LIAM: You asked for a fighting pit,
he made you a fighting pit!

3607
03:07:20.372 --> 03:07:24.204
SAM: This fighting pit is brought to you by Dwarven Forge!

3608
03:07:24.204 --> 03:07:27.521

3610
03:07:29.351 --> 03:07:30.496
TRAVIS: Oh shit!

3611
03:07:30.496 --> 03:07:32.685
LIAM: We love you, Matthew Mercer!

3612
03:07:32.685 --> 03:07:34.258
SAM: Wow!

3613
03:07:34.258 --> 03:07:35.465
LAURA: What the fuck?

3614
03:07:35.465 --> 03:07:37.944
TRAVIS: Is Trent Itchy Crotch in these balconies?

3615
03:07:37.944 --> 03:07:40.635
LIAM: Oh, so cool.
ASHLEY: Oh, and they light up!

3616
03:07:40.635 --> 03:07:42.944
LAURA: Oh my gosh!

3617
03:07:42.944 --> 03:07:44.199
MARISHA: Moody lighting!

3618
03:07:44.199 --> 03:07:46.599
ASHLEY: This is so cool!
LAURA: This is so cool, Matt.

3619
03:07:46.599 --> 03:07:49.250
MATT: Oh, you guys, it's fun to be ridiculous.

3620
03:07:49.250 --> 03:07:51.397
LAURA: Are we up top?
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're already there.

3621
03:07:51.397 --> 03:07:54.895
MATT: You guys have just arrived in the center here.

3622
03:07:54.895 --> 03:07:59.125
LAURA: Oh, look at these fancy people watching.

3623
03:07:59.125 --> 03:08:01.416
MATT: There we go and boop.

3624
03:08:01.416 --> 03:08:02.347
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Ooh!

3625
03:08:02.347 --> 03:08:04.886
SAM: The lights, the sconces.
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

3626
03:08:04.886 --> 03:08:08.759
MATT: So as the rest of the battlers are stretching

3627
03:08:08.759 --> 03:08:12.413
off to the side here, you guys can decide

3628
03:08:12.413 --> 03:08:14.649
where everyone should be.

3629
03:08:14.649 --> 03:08:18.767
So we have Beauregard is fighting, Fjord is fighting,

3630
03:08:18.767 --> 03:08:21.084
and Yasha are fighting, you guys are just keeping here,

3631
03:08:21.084 --> 03:08:23.533
for the time being. The rest of you can sit where you like.

3632
03:08:23.533 --> 03:08:25.821
LIAM: Yeah, Nott, come sit with--

3633
03:08:25.821 --> 03:08:28.401
MATT: And Nott is gone.

3634
03:08:28.401 --> 03:08:30.021
LAURA: Where's Nott?

3635
03:08:30.021 --> 03:08:31.349
LIAM: I don't know.

3636
03:08:31.349 --> 03:08:32.720
MATT: Caduceus?

3637
03:08:32.720 --> 03:08:36.720
TALIESIN: I think, yeah, I'll take
right up that side over here.

3638
03:08:36.720 --> 03:08:39.053
MATT: That side over here? Okay.

3639
03:08:40.079 --> 03:08:42.936
Okay, join that edge there. Caleb?

3640
03:08:42.936 --> 03:08:45.488
LIAM: I will walk down between the clerics

3641
03:08:45.488 --> 03:08:48.390
and as I do so, I'm going to pull out a wire and whisper

3642
03:08:48.390 --> 03:08:51.920
and say: Are you good, or do you need some space?

3643
03:08:51.920 --> 03:08:54.458
MATT: All right moving the table to the side here,

3644
03:08:54.458 --> 03:08:57.254
You guys push into that end.

3645
03:08:57.254 --> 03:08:58.254
Door closes.

3646
03:08:59.338 --> 03:09:00.655
Door closes.

3647
03:09:01.525 --> 03:09:02.358
All right.

3648
03:09:04.355 --> 03:09:06.843
LIAM: I just sent a message saying, are you good,

3649
03:09:06.843 --> 03:09:07.945
do you need some space?

3650
03:09:07.945 --> 03:09:10.483
I don't know if she's blown past the range of it.

3651
03:09:10.483 --> 03:09:11.316
MATT: Right.

3652
03:09:12.372 --> 03:09:14.289
LIAM: She may reply to this message, she knows.

3653
03:09:14.289 --> 03:09:15.368
SAM: I'm good.

3654
03:09:15.368 --> 03:09:16.951
I'll be right back.

3655
03:09:18.921 --> 03:09:21.177
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: That smells so good.

3656
03:09:21.177 --> 03:09:22.510
TALIESIN: I have like...

3657
03:09:24.308 --> 03:09:28.948
MATT: At which point, Jacquel arrives
out in the center space

3658
03:09:28.948 --> 03:09:32.948
stepping into the middle of the tournament range.

3659
03:09:35.280 --> 03:09:39.272
Where is the best one I can use for that?

3660
03:09:41.026 --> 03:09:43.368
I'll just use, I'll use her, it's what I found.

3661
03:09:43.368 --> 03:09:46.197
Steps out and goes like, "Everyone,

3662
03:09:46.197 --> 03:09:50.168
"thank you and welcome to the Stone Coffin.

3663
03:09:50.168 --> 03:09:52.168
"An impromptu fight, yes.

3664
03:09:53.243 --> 03:09:55.423
"But who we are to turn down

3665
03:09:55.423 --> 03:09:57.915
"some proper unexpected entertainment, eh?"

3666
03:09:57.915 --> 03:10:00.776
(yelling) Everyone starts yelling.

3667
03:10:00.776 --> 03:10:05.776
"Well, all coin is put in, we've closed the outside doors.

3668
03:10:05.909 --> 03:10:08.471
"Let's go ahead and call in our first bout for the night!"

3669
03:10:08.471 --> 03:10:09.977
LAURA: Woo!

3670
03:10:09.977 --> 03:10:11.144
TALIESIN: Yeah.
SAM: Yeah!

3671
03:10:12.558 --> 03:10:14.452
MATT: "Coming all the way from the Mudtop,

3672
03:10:14.452 --> 03:10:16.430
"you've seen him fight, you've seen him drop!

3673
03:10:16.430 --> 03:10:18.450
"It's Ovo!"

3674
03:10:18.450 --> 03:10:20.892
And the older man, who has been shadowboxing,

3675
03:10:20.892 --> 03:10:23.551
starts coming out and he's like, (pants)

3676
03:10:23.551 --> 03:10:24.992
walks out and steps in the space

3677
03:10:24.992 --> 03:10:28.969
and everyone gives a "Yeah!" cheer.
TRAVIS: You got it, you got it.

3678
03:10:28.969 --> 03:10:29.886
You got it.

3679
03:10:30.897 --> 03:10:33.416
SAM: You're fighting an old guy?
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

3680
03:10:33.416 --> 03:10:36.299
MATT: And where did you say you were from?

3681
03:10:36.299 --> 03:10:39.069
MARISHA: Hupperdook is what Yasha said.

3682
03:10:39.069 --> 03:10:40.290
LAURA: Up Hup.
MARISHA: Up Hup.

3683
03:10:40.290 --> 03:10:43.271
MATT: "All the way from Up Hup!

3684
03:10:43.271 --> 03:10:44.991
"Beauregard!"

3685
03:10:44.991 --> 03:10:45.824
LAURA: Woo!

3686
03:10:46.951 --> 03:10:48.450
You can do it, Beau!

3687
03:10:48.450 --> 03:10:50.619
MARISHA: Take off my Expositor robes.

3688
03:10:50.619 --> 03:10:53.631
I'm just in my sports bra, kind of tank.

3689
03:10:53.631 --> 03:10:56.540
MATT: Up and joins the others at the edge.

3690
03:10:56.540 --> 03:10:57.872
The doors close.

3691
03:10:57.872 --> 03:10:59.020
LAURA: Kill him!

3692
03:10:59.020 --> 03:11:02.458
TRAVIS: Well, no, I don't think that's what we're going for.

3693
03:11:02.458 --> 03:11:03.958
SAM: Up Hup and away!

3694
03:11:05.528 --> 03:11:07.100
MARISHA: Oh, Jesus Christ.

3695
03:11:07.100 --> 03:11:08.631
(Travis laughs)

3696
03:11:08.631 --> 03:11:09.620
MATT: "Begin!"

3697
03:11:09.620 --> 03:11:11.363
Roll initiative.
ALL: (yelling)

3698
03:11:11.363 --> 03:11:13.502
TRAVIS: Let's go, let's go.

3699
03:11:13.502 --> 03:11:15.201
SAM: Beat up that old man!

3700
03:11:15.201 --> 03:11:16.724
MARISHA: Okay.

3701
03:11:16.724 --> 03:11:18.820
LIAM: Honor the legacy of Vox Machina.

3702
03:11:18.820 --> 03:11:21.182
SAM: Oh, so close!

3703
03:11:21.182 --> 03:11:22.992
MATT: Initiative is?

3704
03:11:22.992 --> 03:11:25.491
MARISHA: 13.
MATT: 13, all right.

3705
03:11:25.491 --> 03:11:27.950
Ovo goes first.
MARISHA: 12, 12, 12.

3706
03:11:27.950 --> 03:11:31.470
MATT: Ovo goes first.
MARISHA: Doesn't matter. Just bad at math.

3707
03:11:31.470 --> 03:11:35.732
MATT: So Ovo is up there, he's like, (pants)

3708
03:11:35.732 --> 03:11:38.495
gets his ground, looking you over and goes--

3709
03:11:38.495 --> 03:11:42.211
MARISHA: I'm looking at him. Can I glean anything?

3710
03:11:43.556 --> 03:11:45.766
MATT: At first look, even for his age--

3711
03:11:45.766 --> 03:11:48.159
MARISHA: He's ripped?
MATT: He's pretty ripped.

3712
03:11:48.159 --> 03:11:50.719
And he looks a little beat up,

3713
03:11:50.719 --> 03:11:53.578
like he's seen some fights, he's some scraps in his day.

3714
03:11:53.578 --> 03:11:55.838
And he's going to go, (grunts)

3715
03:11:55.838 --> 03:11:59.008
and come in for initially a body blow

3716
03:11:59.008 --> 03:12:01.591
followed by two quick punches to the face.

3717
03:12:01.591 --> 03:12:03.077
MARISHA: Okay.

3718
03:12:03.077 --> 03:12:05.999
MATT: First is going to be a nine.

3719
03:12:05.999 --> 03:12:07.137
MARISHA: Miss!

3720
03:12:07.137 --> 03:12:09.657
MATT: Second one is going to be, ah, a 26!

3721
03:12:09.657 --> 03:12:10.657
MARISHA: Hit!

3722
03:12:10.657 --> 03:12:14.695
MATT: All right, on that strike, you take seven points of

3723
03:12:14.695 --> 03:12:19.195
bludgeoning damage and that third strike is going to be a

3724
03:12:20.428 --> 03:12:21.761
24 to hit.
MARISHA: Hit.

3725
03:12:22.935 --> 03:12:25.163
MATT: That's going to be four points of bludgeoning damage.

3726
03:12:25.163 --> 03:12:27.492
So the body blow, you duck out of the way,

3727
03:12:27.492 --> 03:12:30.144
but in pulling back, he immediately upper cuts you

3728
03:12:30.144 --> 03:12:32.603
in the chin, a third strike across the face.

3729
03:12:32.603 --> 03:12:33.614
You're like (groans).

3730
03:12:33.614 --> 03:12:35.720
You feel the blood coming out the corner of your mouth.

3731
03:12:35.720 --> 03:12:38.248
But you get the feeling he's primed.

3732
03:12:38.248 --> 03:12:39.447
He's not going in all yet.

3733
03:12:39.447 --> 03:12:42.289
He's trying to feel for your defenses and read you.

3734
03:12:42.289 --> 03:12:43.897
He's an experienced fighter,

3735
03:12:43.897 --> 03:12:46.268
for as much as you may have looked down upon him

3736
03:12:46.268 --> 03:12:47.744
upon your arrival, it's your turn.

3737
03:12:47.744 --> 03:12:49.115
MARISHA: I never said that.
MATT: I know.

3738
03:12:49.115 --> 03:12:51.085
MARISHA: I did, though.
MATT: I know.

3739
03:12:51.085 --> 03:12:53.985
Well, I figured. It's your turn.

3740
03:12:53.985 --> 03:12:56.652
MARISHA: I wipe the blood.

3741
03:12:57.986 --> 03:12:59.795
Look back at him.

3742
03:12:59.795 --> 03:13:00.795
Kind of nod.

3743
03:13:01.678 --> 03:13:04.333
Ooh, he's going the brother route, okay!

3744
03:13:04.333 --> 03:13:08.063
MATT: Muay Thai kind of flair, a little bit.
MARISHA: Yeah, okay, okay, okay.

3745
03:13:08.063 --> 03:13:10.646
I shift my stance a little bit to adjust

3746
03:13:10.646 --> 03:13:14.992
to more of that Wing Chun-- Yeah, you know, a mai tai.

3747
03:13:14.992 --> 03:13:17.662
Muay Thai. (laughs)

3748
03:13:17.662 --> 03:13:19.329
MATT: Mai tais are good.

3749
03:13:20.502 --> 03:13:21.700
LIAM: Almost time for a Hawaii.

3750
03:13:21.700 --> 03:13:24.888
MARISHA: Go in for pop pop, and then I go on

3751
03:13:24.888 --> 03:13:28.096
the inside, I'm going to try and break his defense.

3752
03:13:28.096 --> 03:13:29.523
SAM: That's funny because pop-pop is

3753
03:13:29.523 --> 03:13:31.142
what his grandchildren call him.

3754
03:13:31.142 --> 03:13:33.390
(laughter)

3755
03:13:33.390 --> 03:13:38.231
MATT: "Get her, Pop-Pop!"
(laughter)

3756
03:13:38.231 --> 03:13:40.473
Pop pop the Pop-Pop.

3757
03:13:42.198 --> 03:13:44.161
MARISHA: First hit.

3758
03:13:44.161 --> 03:13:45.515
Mm, yeah, 27.

3759
03:13:45.515 --> 03:13:46.527
MATT: That hits.

3760
03:13:46.527 --> 03:13:48.135
MARISHA: Stunning strike.

3761
03:13:48.135 --> 03:13:49.267
MATT: Roll damage first.

3762
03:13:49.267 --> 03:13:50.434
MARISHA: But first...

3763
03:13:52.047 --> 03:13:54.019
Oh, Jesus Christ.

3764
03:13:54.019 --> 03:13:55.318
Seven damage.

3765
03:13:55.318 --> 03:13:57.521
MATT: Seven points of damage on the first hit!

3766
03:13:57.521 --> 03:13:58.699
Stunning strike!

3767
03:13:58.699 --> 03:14:00.929
LIAM: Yeah, first d8.

3768
03:14:00.929 --> 03:14:02.096
MATT: That's a 15.

3769
03:14:03.707 --> 03:14:05.409
LAURA: Yeah, it works.

3770
03:14:05.409 --> 03:14:07.553
MARISHA: It's 15.
MATT: Oh, he just resists it!

3771
03:14:07.553 --> 03:14:09.852
So the first hit.

3772
03:14:09.852 --> 03:14:11.161
LIAM: (kid voice) Yay, Pop-Pop!

3773
03:14:11.161 --> 03:14:14.873
MATT: He flexes, old man abs, catch the blow.

3774
03:14:14.873 --> 03:14:16.641
Second strike.
MARISHA: Fuck you, Pop-Pop.

3775
03:14:16.641 --> 03:14:18.593
Second strike.

3776
03:14:18.593 --> 03:14:20.096
Yeah, 28.

3777
03:14:20.096 --> 03:14:21.688
MATT: 28 definitely hits, you roll damage.

3778
03:14:21.688 --> 03:14:25.136
SAM: (kid voice) Don't kill my grandfather! (laughs)

3779
03:14:25.136 --> 03:14:28.553
MARISHA: 11 damage, stunning strike.

3780
03:14:30.006 --> 03:14:32.117
MATT: That's a fail!

3781
03:14:32.117 --> 03:14:33.376
MARISHA: He is stunned.

3782
03:14:33.376 --> 03:14:36.654
MATT: So he goes, deflects the first one off the stomach,

3783
03:14:36.654 --> 03:14:39.596
the second one, you go in to strike, where are you punching?

3784
03:14:39.596 --> 03:14:40.726
SAM: In the dentures.

3785
03:14:40.726 --> 03:14:43.377
(laughter)

3786
03:14:43.377 --> 03:14:46.157
LAURA: (kid voice) No, Pop-Pop! What's wrong with him?

3787
03:14:46.157 --> 03:14:48.198
MARISHA: I'm going to do what he did to me.

3788
03:14:48.198 --> 03:14:50.815
I'm going to do an upper cut with a cross,

3789
03:14:50.815 --> 03:14:53.708
right across his face, I'm going to go for a meta.

3790
03:14:53.708 --> 03:14:55.886
LIAM: His teeth are out!

3791
03:14:55.886 --> 03:14:57.257
MARISHA: Go right for that temple.

3792
03:14:57.257 --> 03:15:00.189
MATT: So whack, it hits and you watch him take a few steps,

3793
03:15:00.189 --> 03:15:01.310
as he stumbles to catch himself.

3794
03:15:01.310 --> 03:15:03.620
MARISHA: As I see him take those two steps,

3795
03:15:03.620 --> 03:15:08.290
I'm going to do a full barrel rotating double kick.

3796
03:15:08.290 --> 03:15:10.957
Pop pop with a...

3797
03:15:12.760 --> 03:15:13.806
That thing that I do.

3798
03:15:13.806 --> 03:15:16.231
LAURA: Flurry of Blows.
MARISHA: Thank you.

3799
03:15:16.231 --> 03:15:18.519
I'm a little delusional.
MATT: That's okay.

3800
03:15:18.519 --> 03:15:21.378
MARISHA: Happy holiday, Flurry of Blows.

3801
03:15:21.378 --> 03:15:23.916
MATT: Go for it, advantage on both of these attacks

3802
03:15:23.916 --> 03:15:24.890
because he's stunned.

3803
03:15:24.890 --> 03:15:26.148
MARISHA: First attack.

3804
03:15:29.018 --> 03:15:30.738
19.

3805
03:15:30.738 --> 03:15:32.429
MATT: 19 hits.

3806
03:15:32.429 --> 03:15:35.427
MARISHA: Thank god I did that.

3807
03:15:35.427 --> 03:15:37.532
12.
LIAM: Put him in a body bag.

3808
03:15:37.532 --> 03:15:40.204
MARISHA: Damage and then...
TRAVIS: Sweep the leg, Johnny!

3809
03:15:40.204 --> 03:15:41.845
MARISHA: Jesus Christ.

3810
03:15:41.845 --> 03:15:43.636
17.

3811
03:15:43.636 --> 03:15:45.034
MATT: 17?
MARISHA: Yeah.

3812
03:15:45.034 --> 03:15:45.937
MATT: Hits.

3813
03:15:45.937 --> 03:15:47.270
LAURA: Woo!

3814
03:15:49.585 --> 03:15:50.716
MARISHA: 10 damage.

3815
03:15:50.716 --> 03:15:53.847
MATT: 10 damage, so, boof, boof, boof!

3816
03:15:53.847 --> 03:15:56.809
You watch him (impacts) and he falls,

3817
03:15:56.809 --> 03:16:01.159
and catches himself on a hand and has to get back up.

3818
03:16:01.159 --> 03:16:04.659
MARISHA: And then after doing the full rotating--
MATT: He's shaking.

3819
03:16:05.684 --> 03:16:08.632
MARISHA: -- the roundhouse--
MATT: He's able to focus, you see his eyes re-focusing.

3820
03:16:08.632 --> 03:16:13.382
It's his turn now. Or you have your movement.
MARISHA: As I come down, I'll hit him and then

3821
03:16:14.444 --> 03:16:17.473
watching him, Extract Aspects,

3822
03:16:17.473 --> 03:16:19.369
which is absurd, for an old man.

3823
03:16:19.369 --> 03:16:23.311
MATT: Okay, well, well, he is analyzed.

3824
03:16:24.324 --> 03:16:25.264
But he--

3825
03:16:25.264 --> 03:16:26.407
TRAVIS: He has gingivitis.

3826
03:16:26.407 --> 03:16:28.697
(laughter)

3827
03:16:28.697 --> 03:16:33.037
LIAM: His pockets are full of
Werther's butterscotch candies.

3828
03:16:33.037 --> 03:16:35.197
MATT: He's resistant to very good scotch.

3829
03:16:35.197 --> 03:16:40.130
(laughter)

3830
03:16:41.899 --> 03:16:43.848
LIAM: Fiscally conservative.

3831
03:16:43.848 --> 03:16:45.222
(laughter)

3832
03:16:45.222 --> 03:16:47.926
SAM: He's part of the greatest generation.

3833
03:16:47.926 --> 03:16:49.286
(laughter)

3834
03:16:49.286 --> 03:16:51.565
MARISHA: Will give you socks for Christmas.

3835
03:16:51.565 --> 03:16:54.537
TRAVIS: Okay, boomer.
MARISHA: Okay, okay, sorry, sorry.

3836
03:16:54.537 --> 03:16:56.267
LIAM: There it is.

3837
03:16:56.267 --> 03:16:57.787
MARISHA: That's it.

3838
03:16:57.787 --> 03:16:59.405
MATT: He has no condition immunities

3839
03:16:59.405 --> 03:17:01.645
or damage resistances or immunities.

3840
03:17:01.645 --> 03:17:03.184
He's a dude.

3841
03:17:05.253 --> 03:17:08.161
But, but, he is definitely stunned

3842
03:17:08.161 --> 03:17:10.683
and you definitely have analyzed him, so.

3843
03:17:10.683 --> 03:17:11.516
MARISHA: Okay.

3844
03:17:13.032 --> 03:17:16.312
MATT: You going to move or stay put?

3845
03:17:16.312 --> 03:17:19.195
MARISHA: Did I knock him back any or anything?

3846
03:17:19.195 --> 03:17:23.454
MATT: No, he's just like--
MARISHA: He's just fucked up.

3847
03:17:23.454 --> 03:17:25.120
MATT: Trying to focus on where you are.

3848
03:17:25.120 --> 03:17:27.360
MARISHA: Well, he's stunned.
LAURA: You get to go again.

3849
03:17:27.360 --> 03:17:29.552
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll...

3850
03:17:30.414 --> 03:17:33.065
Yeah, I'm going to get to go again.
I'm just going to stay here.

3851
03:17:33.065 --> 03:17:34.878
MATT: Okay, it's his turn.

3852
03:17:34.878 --> 03:17:35.955
LAURA: He's stunned.

3853
03:17:35.955 --> 03:17:37.141
MATT: Yeah, he can't do anything.

3854
03:17:37.141 --> 03:17:40.447
He goes like, (slurred) "Come on!

3855
03:17:40.447 --> 03:17:42.014
"I gotcha!"

3856
03:17:42.992 --> 03:17:44.586
That's his turn, your turn.

3857
03:17:44.586 --> 03:17:47.753
SAM: He's like, whoa, what's a TikTok?

3858
03:17:49.064 --> 03:17:50.571
TRAVIS: "What's a TikTok?"

3859
03:17:50.571 --> 03:17:55.537
(laughter)

3860
03:18:00.312 --> 03:18:02.542
MARISHA: I'm going to take the top of my turn

3861
03:18:02.542 --> 03:18:07.051
to just turn and look at Fjord through the bars and go--

3862
03:18:07.051 --> 03:18:09.384
and I go right back into it.

3863
03:18:10.803 --> 03:18:12.163
TRAVIS: Make that money.

3864
03:18:12.163 --> 03:18:13.663
MARISHA: Make that money!

3865
03:18:17.859 --> 03:18:19.279
Pop pop.

3866
03:18:19.279 --> 03:18:21.219
MATT: Yeah, advantage on both attacks.

3867
03:18:21.219 --> 03:18:26.030
MARISHA: So as he's stumbling back,
I'm going to rush forward

3868
03:18:26.030 --> 03:18:30.048
with a knee to his sternum

3869
03:18:30.048 --> 03:18:34.259
and then go for a palm strike to his chin

3870
03:18:34.259 --> 03:18:36.365
to continue to press on him.

3871
03:18:36.365 --> 03:18:38.973
MATT: First knee lunge, go for it.

3872
03:18:38.973 --> 03:18:40.493
MARISHA: Still at advantage, right?
MATT: Yes.

3873
03:18:40.493 --> 03:18:43.237
LIAM: This is like Jason Bourne against
the Pepperidge Farm guy.

3874
03:18:43.237 --> 03:18:44.784
(laughter)

3875
03:18:44.784 --> 03:18:46.534
MARISHA: 24.
MATT: 24 definitely hits.

3876
03:18:46.534 --> 03:18:48.270
You roll damage.

3877
03:18:48.270 --> 03:18:49.270
MARISHA: 12 damage.

3878
03:18:50.509 --> 03:18:52.160
MATT: Right in the chest. (groans)

3879
03:18:52.160 --> 03:18:54.092
You see a little bit of spittle.

3880
03:18:54.092 --> 03:18:56.490
He's like Street Fighter style when you occasionally hit him

3881
03:18:56.490 --> 03:18:57.988
and they throw up in Street Fighter 2.

3882
03:18:57.988 --> 03:18:59.774
MARISHA: I'm going to keep pushing into his triangle

3883
03:18:59.774 --> 03:19:01.857
and go for a palm strike.

3884
03:19:03.183 --> 03:19:04.305
MATT: What was the second attack?

3885
03:19:04.305 --> 03:19:05.842
MARISHA: 24.

3886
03:19:05.842 --> 03:19:08.317
With 13 damage.

3887
03:19:10.185 --> 03:19:13.909
MATT: You watch two teeth go flipping out.

3888
03:19:13.909 --> 03:19:14.761
TRAVIS: Chiclets!

3889
03:19:14.761 --> 03:19:15.881
MATT: That's your action, you still have your bonus.

3890
03:19:15.881 --> 03:19:17.258
MARISHA: I kind of--

3891
03:19:17.258 --> 03:19:19.276
LIAM: Kinda feel bad?
MARISHA: Feel bad.

3892
03:19:19.276 --> 03:19:20.617
LAURA: Kill him, Beau!

3893
03:19:20.617 --> 03:19:23.349
MARISHA: But I go for the stunning strike for that last one

3894
03:19:23.349 --> 03:19:26.293
with his cracked teeth, let's see.

3895
03:19:26.293 --> 03:19:28.626
Yeah, stunning strike again.

3896
03:19:29.956 --> 03:19:31.425
MATT: 16, he makes it.

3897
03:19:31.425 --> 03:19:32.592
MARISHA: He makes it?

3898
03:19:34.503 --> 03:19:36.732
But he's still stunned currently?

3899
03:19:36.732 --> 03:19:37.999
MATT: Yep, and you still have your bonus action.

3900
03:19:37.999 --> 03:19:40.958
MARISHA: So Flurry of Blows.

3901
03:19:42.545 --> 03:19:44.231
TALIESIN: That's mean, that's mean!

3902
03:19:44.231 --> 03:19:47.959
MARISHA: Another ki point, so, burning through.

3903
03:19:47.959 --> 03:19:49.992
LIAM: Forest Law.
MARISHA: While I've got advantage.

3904
03:19:49.992 --> 03:19:52.487
MATT: You guys've seen how monks are
in a duel, at our live show.

3905
03:19:52.487 --> 03:19:56.977
MARISHA: A natural 19, 29, with a seven on my hit, so 13.

3906
03:19:56.977 --> 03:19:58.969
MATT: 13 damage?
MARISHA: Yeah.

3907
03:19:58.969 --> 03:20:00.577
LAURA: Can you stunning strike on a bonus action?

3908
03:20:00.577 --> 03:20:01.410
MARISHA: Yes, I can.

3909
03:20:01.410 --> 03:20:04.917
MATT: So this attack now, he's like, (groans)

3910
03:20:04.917 --> 03:20:07.317
MARISHA: And then...

3911
03:20:09.153 --> 03:20:11.842
I'm going to back around and go for a full roundhouse

3912
03:20:11.842 --> 03:20:13.415
for another stunning strike.

3913
03:20:13.415 --> 03:20:15.153
MATT: Stepping back for a strike against the head.

3914
03:20:15.153 --> 03:20:17.739
With the momentum you (whoosh) into a spinning

3915
03:20:17.739 --> 03:20:18.979
back kick to the head.

3916
03:20:18.979 --> 03:20:21.479
MARISHA: Yeah, stunning strike again.

3917
03:20:22.591 --> 03:20:24.830
Both of those are 16s, so 26,

3918
03:20:24.830 --> 03:20:29.231
and I rolled on an eight on a d8, so 14 damage.

3919
03:20:29.231 --> 03:20:31.808
Stunning strike.
MATT: Stunning strike.

3920
03:20:31.808 --> 03:20:32.989
14.

3921
03:20:32.989 --> 03:20:33.822
MARISHA: Fail.

3922
03:20:33.822 --> 03:20:35.967
ALL: Oh, no!

3923
03:20:35.967 --> 03:20:36.989
LAURA: Poor Pop-Pop!

3924
03:20:36.989 --> 03:20:38.658
TALIESIN: Oh, Pop-Pop.

3925
03:20:38.658 --> 03:20:40.338
MATT: All right, so (impacts)

3926
03:20:40.338 --> 03:20:45.104
LAURA: I've never seem him so badly beaten before!
MATT: He's down on one knee and he's like, (groans)

3927
03:20:46.722 --> 03:20:49.773
Looking up at you, one eye, you can't see the white,

3928
03:20:49.773 --> 03:20:52.743
because it's just red.
(laughter)

3929
03:20:52.743 --> 03:20:55.682
He's like (stuttering groan)
(laughter)

3930
03:20:55.682 --> 03:20:56.849
Next turn, go.

3931
03:20:59.275 --> 03:21:02.775
MARISHA: I turn...
(laughter)

3932
03:21:08.342 --> 03:21:10.847
MATT: Everyone's like, "Whoa!

3933
03:21:10.847 --> 03:21:11.988
"Wha-- whoa!"

3934
03:21:11.988 --> 03:21:14.107
It's your turn, what're you doing?

3935
03:21:14.107 --> 03:21:15.704
TRAVIS: Oh, shit!

3936
03:21:15.704 --> 03:21:17.012
MARISHA: I turn and I look at Jacquel.

3937
03:21:17.012 --> 03:21:19.020
Do I see Jacquel behind me?

3938
03:21:20.312 --> 03:21:22.173
MATT: No, you don't see Jacquel anywhere behind you.

3939
03:21:22.173 --> 03:21:24.756
You see Fjord and Yasha going--

3940
03:21:26.293 --> 03:21:28.793
MARISHA: I go: Is there a ring medic?

3941
03:21:29.752 --> 03:21:30.919
LAURA: Destroy him!

3942
03:21:32.271 --> 03:21:33.579
TRAVIS: Finish him!

3943
03:21:33.579 --> 03:21:35.391
MARISHA: Ah!

3944
03:21:35.391 --> 03:21:36.801
Elbow to his grill.

3945
03:21:36.801 --> 03:21:39.132
MATT: (laughs) Okay!

3946
03:21:39.132 --> 03:21:40.382
With advantage.

3947
03:21:41.383 --> 03:21:43.291
TRAVIS: He's like, "Janice?"

3948
03:21:43.291 --> 03:21:45.153
LIAM: <i>Specifically</i> the grill?!

3949
03:21:45.153 --> 03:21:47.532
You already took out the front teeth!
MARISHA: My first wife!

3950
03:21:47.532 --> 03:21:49.081
(laughter)

3951
03:21:49.081 --> 03:21:51.383
SAM: Are you my granddaughter?

3952
03:21:51.383 --> 03:21:52.861
(laughter)

3953
03:21:52.861 --> 03:21:54.037
LAURA: Oh, no.

3954
03:21:54.037 --> 03:21:55.383
MATT: Roll your attack!

3955
03:21:55.383 --> 03:21:56.449
(laughter)

3956
03:21:56.449 --> 03:21:58.510
MARISHA: I have advantage.
MATT: Yeah, you do.

3957
03:21:58.510 --> 03:22:00.470
MARISHA: I feel so bad about this!

3958
03:22:00.470 --> 03:22:02.641
LIAM: But it's Christmas.

3959
03:22:02.641 --> 03:22:03.724
MARISHA: Natural 18.

3960
03:22:04.900 --> 03:22:05.733
28.

3961
03:22:07.228 --> 03:22:09.990
Nine damage.
MATT: Okay.

3962
03:22:09.990 --> 03:22:11.338
He's still standing.

3963
03:22:11.338 --> 03:22:12.869
And what was this attack?

3964
03:22:12.869 --> 03:22:13.868
MARISHA: Huh?

3965
03:22:13.868 --> 03:22:14.788
MATT: What attack was this?

3966
03:22:14.788 --> 03:22:19.515
MARISHA: Oh, I was elbowing him
in the face for my first pop.

3967
03:22:19.515 --> 03:22:21.630
MATT: Second attack with advantage.
MARISHA: For my second pop.

3968
03:22:21.630 --> 03:22:23.432
TRAVIS: He's making that broken windpipe sound.

3969
03:22:23.432 --> 03:22:24.599
MARISHA: Yeah, he is.

3970
03:22:27.002 --> 03:22:28.612
Both of those are 17s.

3971
03:22:28.612 --> 03:22:30.373
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: 12 damage.

3972
03:22:30.373 --> 03:22:33.282
MATT: 12 damage. All right, you
have your bonus action still.

3973
03:22:33.282 --> 03:22:36.020
As you elbow, you go once again on the side of the head

3974
03:22:36.020 --> 03:22:39.610
and he just (cracking, groaning)

3975
03:22:39.610 --> 03:22:41.137
MARISHA: How is he looking?

3976
03:22:41.137 --> 03:22:42.887
MATT: Oh, he's fucked up!

3977
03:22:44.374 --> 03:22:47.633
TRAVIS: Come on, come on, put him out, put him out!

3978
03:22:47.633 --> 03:22:50.052
MATT: You have a bonus action.
ASHLEY: Put him out of his misery.

3979
03:22:50.052 --> 03:22:52.306
TRAVIS: People are like, fuckin' take him down!

3980
03:22:52.306 --> 03:22:56.050
MARISHA: (screams) Okay, I'm going to, okay, okay.

3981
03:22:56.050 --> 03:23:00.150
Can I, as a flavored

3982
03:23:02.021 --> 03:23:05.170
Flurry of Blows, get him into a sleeper hold

3983
03:23:05.170 --> 03:23:07.141
and just: Go to sleep, go to sleep.

3984
03:23:07.141 --> 03:23:08.792
MATT: I'll allow it.

3985
03:23:08.792 --> 03:23:12.900
MARISHA: End this in a "so I'm not breaking
more of his dentures" kind of way.

3986
03:23:12.900 --> 03:23:14.238
MATT: I'll allow it.
MARISHA: All right, all right.

3987
03:23:14.238 --> 03:23:16.789
TALIESIN: What dentures are left?

3988
03:23:16.789 --> 03:23:19.889
You're just hitting gums now.

3989
03:23:19.889 --> 03:23:21.321
MARISHA: 27.

3990
03:23:21.321 --> 03:23:22.723
MATT: 27, all right.

3991
03:23:22.723 --> 03:23:25.102
TRAVIS: This is no way comparable.
MARISHA: Eight damage.

3992
03:23:25.102 --> 03:23:27.111
No, not in any capacity.

3993
03:23:27.111 --> 03:23:29.770
MATT: All right, eight damage.
MARISHA: I'm a horrible person right now.

3994
03:23:29.770 --> 03:23:32.216
MATT: And your second one?

3995
03:23:32.216 --> 03:23:35.230
LIAM: It's just adding layers of complexity.

3996
03:23:35.230 --> 03:23:39.595
SAM: I can't go to sleep yet; I haven't taken my pills.

3997
03:23:39.595 --> 03:23:40.757
MARISHA: 27.

3998
03:23:40.757 --> 03:23:42.007
MATT: Okay, damage?

3999
03:23:43.338 --> 03:23:47.597
MARISHA: 11 and stunning strike again to try and end this.

4000
03:23:47.597 --> 03:23:48.677
SAM: Fucking god.

4001
03:23:48.677 --> 03:23:50.520
MATT: I already know how you want to do this.

4002
03:23:50.520 --> 03:23:51.840
MARISHA: Okay.

4003
03:23:51.840 --> 03:23:56.048
LIAM: My grandson graduates the eighth grade tomorrow.

4004
03:23:56.048 --> 03:24:00.480
MATT: And with rapid shushing,

4005
03:24:00.480 --> 03:24:03.231
he goes to sleep in Beauregard's arms

4006
03:24:03.231 --> 03:24:05.306
before eventually, once you feel him go limp,

4007
03:24:05.306 --> 03:24:08.000
you set him down.

4008
03:24:08.000 --> 03:24:09.167
Everyone goes--

4009
03:24:10.919 --> 03:24:13.838
(scattered applause)

4010
03:24:13.838 --> 03:24:15.156
MATT: "Yeah!"

4011
03:24:15.156 --> 03:24:17.841
ALL: Woo!

4012
03:24:17.841 --> 03:24:20.543
MARISHA: Ah?
TRAVIS: Holy shit!

4013
03:24:21.880 --> 03:24:24.390
TALIESIN: Wow, that was dark.

4014
03:24:24.390 --> 03:24:29.390
MATT: The door opens and the white-robed figure rushes out

4015
03:24:29.569 --> 03:24:31.940
and grabs him, heals him up for a second,

4016
03:24:31.940 --> 03:24:36.940
he (gasps) shoots up to consciousness.

4017
03:24:37.811 --> 03:24:39.237
MARISHA: I help him up.

4018
03:24:39.237 --> 03:24:41.459
MATT: You pick him up and he's like (pants).

4019
03:24:41.459 --> 03:24:43.096
MARISHA: Man, no, don't.

4020
03:24:43.096 --> 03:24:47.112
MATT: "And our victor goes to Beauregard!"

4021
03:24:47.112 --> 03:24:48.476
TRAVIS: Oh, my god.

4022
03:24:48.476 --> 03:24:52.915
MATT: "And a big round of applause for Ovo, once again!"

4023
03:24:52.915 --> 03:24:55.386
Ovo's like, "Yeah!"

4024
03:24:55.386 --> 03:24:57.461
(laughter)

4025
03:24:57.461 --> 03:24:59.391
MARISHA: And I just kind of...

4026
03:24:59.391 --> 03:25:01.801
TRAVIS: Are the back of his pants covered in brown?

4027
03:25:01.801 --> 03:25:04.070
(laughter)

4028
03:25:04.070 --> 03:25:05.570
MATT: If you're lucky.

4029
03:25:06.997 --> 03:25:09.456
TALIESIN: No, they're red.
MATT: Out of the pit,

4030
03:25:10.421 --> 03:25:13.199
and Ovo immediately grabs a tankard

4031
03:25:13.199 --> 03:25:16.810
and sits down and just starts drinking.

4032
03:25:16.810 --> 03:25:18.643
Looks up at you and goes--

4033
03:25:19.602 --> 03:25:20.435
LAURA: Oh.

4034
03:25:20.435 --> 03:25:23.827
TRAVIS: Give that dude some money, holy shit.

4035
03:25:23.827 --> 03:25:27.859
MARISHA: Hey, man, I kind of illegally betted on myself.

4036
03:25:27.859 --> 03:25:30.125
I don't know what the laws are, but--

4037
03:25:30.125 --> 03:25:32.627
TRAVIS: You're in an underground fighting pit.

4038
03:25:32.627 --> 03:25:33.803
MARISHA: Yeah, there are none.

4039
03:25:33.803 --> 03:25:35.750
You know what? Let me get back to you.

4040
03:25:35.750 --> 03:25:37.137
Just sit for a second.

4041
03:25:37.137 --> 03:25:38.936
MATT: "You bet on yourself?"

4042
03:25:38.936 --> 03:25:40.865
MARISHA: No, I didn't say that.

4043
03:25:40.865 --> 03:25:42.758
You're delusional.

4044
03:25:42.758 --> 03:25:43.846
MATT: "Oh."

4045
03:25:43.846 --> 03:25:44.836
Make a deception check.

4046
03:25:44.836 --> 03:25:48.645
TRAVIS: There's blood coming out of your ear.

4047
03:25:48.645 --> 03:25:50.484
TALIESIN: Natural one.

4048
03:25:50.484 --> 03:25:51.317
MARISHA: 11.

4049
03:25:51.317 --> 03:25:55.314
MATT: He goes, "If you give me what you bet on yourself

4050
03:25:55.314 --> 03:25:57.191
"I won't tell them."

4051
03:25:57.191 --> 03:25:59.178
MARISHA: Yeah, let me think about that, I feel real bad.

4052
03:25:59.178 --> 03:26:00.043
MATT: Yeah, okay.

4053
03:26:00.043 --> 03:26:01.464
MARISHA: Yeah, it's not like a hard sell.

4054
03:26:01.464 --> 03:26:04.044
I'm going to be totally honest.

4055
03:26:04.044 --> 03:26:05.514
MATT: "Was I good?"

4056
03:26:05.514 --> 03:26:07.812
MARISHA: You were, dude, I'm--

4057
03:26:07.812 --> 03:26:08.941
MATT: "Ha-ha, I knew it!"

4058
03:26:08.941 --> 03:26:10.512
TRAVIS: Is he just stumbling around?

4059
03:26:10.512 --> 03:26:13.078
MATT: Yeah, he's doing circles in his space

4060
03:26:13.078 --> 03:26:15.723
before he sits back down again.

4061
03:26:15.723 --> 03:26:17.082
ASHLEY: I'm leaning against that back wall,

4062
03:26:17.082 --> 03:26:18.640
and I raise my mai tai at her.

4063
03:26:18.640 --> 03:26:23.540
(laughter)

4064
03:26:25.828 --> 03:26:27.876
MATT: You get the sense from the cheers,

4065
03:26:27.876 --> 03:26:30.063
and people recognize him, he comes here and fights probably

4066
03:26:30.063 --> 03:26:33.343
a lot and based on that fight he probably doesn't win a lot.

4067
03:26:33.343 --> 03:26:37.371
But most everyone who fights here wins a little money.

4068
03:26:37.371 --> 03:26:38.549
ASHLEY: Oh, boy.

4069
03:26:38.549 --> 03:26:39.920
MARISHA: Yeah.

4070
03:26:39.920 --> 03:26:42.717
MATT: So anyway, you get the sense he's a

4071
03:26:42.717 --> 03:26:47.059
"win or lose, I still get paid"-type fighter.

4072
03:26:47.059 --> 03:26:50.957
At that point, Jacquel comes out once more and goes,

4073
03:26:50.957 --> 03:26:54.115
"So that was a rapid display!

4074
03:26:55.346 --> 03:26:57.426
"But it was just the warm up, because now,

4075
03:26:57.426 --> 03:27:01.066
"we're taking here, to the battlefield,

4076
03:27:01.066 --> 03:27:03.333
"our second fight of the night.

4077
03:27:03.333 --> 03:27:06.170
"This one, not fisticuffs.

4078
03:27:06.170 --> 03:27:07.837
"This one's to steel!

4079
03:27:09.399 --> 03:27:13.869
"And I'll bring here, first time to the battlefield,

4080
03:27:13.869 --> 03:27:17.057
"all the way from the Menagerie Coast:

4081
03:27:17.057 --> 03:27:18.606
"Darrow!

4082
03:27:18.606 --> 03:27:20.748
"Of the Stubborn Stock!"

4083
03:27:20.748 --> 03:27:22.423
He looks over at you, goes like,

4084
03:27:22.423 --> 03:27:25.058
"Hey, friend, may the best fighter win."

4085
03:27:25.058 --> 03:27:28.460
And he rushes out with the jog with his weapons ready.

4086
03:27:28.460 --> 03:27:30.620
LAURA: Woo!

4087
03:27:30.620 --> 03:27:31.722
MATT: "Yeah!"

4088
03:27:31.722 --> 03:27:36.153
The crowd's cheering and one woman is up there dressed

4089
03:27:36.153 --> 03:27:38.592
really nice, throws a rose down towards him and he (laughs)

4090
03:27:38.592 --> 03:27:41.494
drops his battleaxe and catches it in the air.

4091
03:27:41.494 --> 03:27:43.244
SAM: Medieval Times guy.

4092
03:27:45.385 --> 03:27:47.781
MARISHA: Yeah Green Knight, yeah!
TALIESIN: Green Knight!

4093
03:27:47.781 --> 03:27:50.364
(laughter)

4094
03:27:52.141 --> 03:27:55.061
MATT: "And the other challenger:

4095
03:27:55.061 --> 03:27:56.570
"Fjord!"

4096
03:27:56.570 --> 03:27:57.991
Where did you say you were from again?

4097
03:27:57.991 --> 03:27:59.221
TRAVIS: From Port Damali.

4098
03:27:59.221 --> 03:28:00.746
MATT: "From Port Damali!"

4099
03:28:00.746 --> 03:28:02.579
(cheering)

4100
03:28:02.579 --> 03:28:05.928
TRAVIS: As I walk in, I point to him and I open up my hand

4101
03:28:05.928 --> 03:28:10.862
and I cast Armor of Agathys on myself at 5th-level.

4102
03:28:12.576 --> 03:28:15.565
It's pulling in all of the moisture of the air.

4103
03:28:15.565 --> 03:28:18.957
And I'll look at him and say: I'm excited for this.

4104
03:28:18.957 --> 03:28:20.907
Time for a tune up of some new tricks.

4105
03:28:20.907 --> 03:28:22.099
MATT: "(laughs)

4106
03:28:22.099 --> 03:28:24.317
"Oh, don't worry, friend.

4107
03:28:24.317 --> 03:28:26.706
"I've got a few tricks up on my own sleeve."

4108
03:28:26.706 --> 03:28:28.658
You see him reach up and grab something around his neck

4109
03:28:28.658 --> 03:28:30.748
and close his eyes for a second

4110
03:28:30.748 --> 03:28:33.535
and he grabs his shield back up once more,

4111
03:28:33.535 --> 03:28:35.054
has his battleaxe at the side.

4112
03:28:35.054 --> 03:28:35.887
TRAVIS: Shit.

4113
03:28:37.823 --> 03:28:38.656
MATT: And...

4114
03:28:42.626 --> 03:28:45.225
He's going to go ahead and concentrate for a second

4115
03:28:45.225 --> 03:28:48.335
and you watch as the battleaxe begins to grow

4116
03:28:48.335 --> 03:28:51.374
with a bright light that shines,

4117
03:28:51.374 --> 03:28:55.177
like a vibrant white torch, and 20 feet around him.

4118
03:28:55.177 --> 03:28:57.814
All of a sudden, it's just this lighthouse

4119
03:28:57.814 --> 03:29:00.743
of a battleaxe, glowing, and you can see the holy symbol

4120
03:29:00.743 --> 03:29:02.614
around his neck that you now notice,

4121
03:29:02.614 --> 03:29:05.572
the symbol of Pelor glow as well.

4122
03:29:05.572 --> 03:29:07.604
LAURA: I told you that guy was really hardcore.

4123
03:29:07.604 --> 03:29:10.606
MATT: Everyone goes like, "Whoa, yeah!"

4124
03:29:10.606 --> 03:29:12.057
Cheers again at both of you guys,

4125
03:29:12.057 --> 03:29:16.905
as you have all this icy frozen armor that's now spines

4126
03:29:16.905 --> 03:29:20.436
of jagged frost sticking out of you

4127
03:29:20.436 --> 03:29:24.766
and the other figure just holding this beacon of light.

4128
03:29:24.766 --> 03:29:26.966
TRAVIS: I just stand there and raise my fists.

4129
03:29:26.966 --> 03:29:28.849
MATT: Your fists?

4130
03:29:28.849 --> 03:29:30.932
(Darrow laughs)

4131
03:29:31.768 --> 03:29:34.746
Everyone looks around and goes like,

4132
03:29:34.746 --> 03:29:36.584
(as Jacquel) "All right, looks
like an interesting fight here.

4133
03:29:36.584 --> 03:29:38.722
"Weapon on bare knuckles!"

4134
03:29:38.722 --> 03:29:40.490
TALIESIN: He's starting to believe.
MATT: "Okay."

4135
03:29:40.490 --> 03:29:45.115
(laughter)

4136
03:29:46.852 --> 03:29:48.652
ASHLEY: Oh, my god.

4137
03:29:48.652 --> 03:29:50.069
SAM: The Owlbear is here?

4138
03:29:50.921 --> 03:29:52.001
MATT: "Begin!"

4139
03:29:52.001 --> 03:29:53.379
Roll initiative.

4140
03:29:53.379 --> 03:29:54.296
(cheering)

4141
03:29:55.183 --> 03:29:56.853
LAURA: Come on, Fjord!

4142
03:29:56.853 --> 03:29:57.861
TRAVIS: 11.

4143
03:29:57.861 --> 03:29:59.277
MATT: 11.

4144
03:30:00.632 --> 03:30:04.132
All righty, Darrow goes first with a 13.

4145
03:30:05.432 --> 03:30:08.320
So Darrow's like, "Friend!

4146
03:30:08.320 --> 03:30:10.672
"Come on, I want you to show me what you've got,

4147
03:30:10.672 --> 03:30:12.840
"but first, let me show you mine."

4148
03:30:12.840 --> 03:30:16.140
He rushes in towards you at an angle

4149
03:30:16.140 --> 03:30:18.130
to push over to this direction.

4150
03:30:18.130 --> 03:30:21.000
Is going to begin

4151
03:30:21.000 --> 03:30:22.944
with two melee attacks against you.

4152
03:30:22.944 --> 03:30:24.272
TRAVIS: Okay.

4153
03:30:24.272 --> 03:30:28.439
MATT: With the battleaxe, the first one is going to be...

4154
03:30:30.810 --> 03:30:33.078
24 to hit.
TRAVIS: Hits.

4155
03:30:33.078 --> 03:30:36.665
MATT: The second one is 24 to hit, same roll twice in a row.

4156
03:30:36.665 --> 03:30:39.927
All right, you take, from each blow--

4157
03:30:39.927 --> 03:30:43.935
the first attack you take 10 points of slashing damage.

4158
03:30:43.935 --> 03:30:44.964
TRAVIS: Okay.

4159
03:30:44.964 --> 03:30:47.322
MATT: And eight points of radiant damage.

4160
03:30:47.322 --> 03:30:48.474
TRAVIS: Okay.

4161
03:30:48.474 --> 03:30:51.391
MATT: As it strikes you and this flash of radiant energy

4162
03:30:51.391 --> 03:30:53.262
blasts off the impact.

4163
03:30:53.262 --> 03:30:57.602
The second strike is 13 points of slashing damage.

4164
03:30:57.602 --> 03:30:58.922
TRAVIS: Okay.

4165
03:30:58.922 --> 03:31:01.082
MATT: And seven points of radiant damage.

4166
03:31:01.082 --> 03:31:02.403
TALIESIN: (whistles)
TRAVIS: Gotcha.

4167
03:31:02.403 --> 03:31:05.721
MATT: How much damage does he take from Armor of Agathys?

4168
03:31:05.721 --> 03:31:07.053
TRAVIS: Two strikes?
MATT: Yes.

4169
03:31:07.053 --> 03:31:09.253
TRAVIS: So 50 points of cold damage.

4170
03:31:09.253 --> 03:31:10.836
LAURA: 50 points?!
LIAM: What?!

4171
03:31:12.324 --> 03:31:13.295
SAM: Five zero?
LIAM: What?

4172
03:31:13.295 --> 03:31:14.128
ASHLEY: Damn!

4173
03:31:14.128 --> 03:31:17.450
MATT: Yeah, high level Armor of Agathys is rough.

4174
03:31:17.450 --> 03:31:20.098
SAM: Every hit is 25 points of damage?

4175
03:31:20.098 --> 03:31:22.119
LIAM: That's one and a half to two hits.

4176
03:31:22.119 --> 03:31:24.312
MATT: For every spell level, it's five points of damage

4177
03:31:24.312 --> 03:31:26.699
every time it takes damage, as long as the armor lasts.

4178
03:31:26.699 --> 03:31:28.882
MARISHA: That's so cool.

4179
03:31:28.882 --> 03:31:30.140
MATT: Is the armor still around after that?

4180
03:31:30.140 --> 03:31:31.780
TRAVIS: That's it, that's it.
MATT: The armor's gone?

4181
03:31:31.780 --> 03:31:33.529
TRAVIS: Yep.
MATT: Okay, so the armor's over.

4182
03:31:33.529 --> 03:31:35.911
The first strike hits.
LAURA: It's still fucking badass.

4183
03:31:35.911 --> 03:31:38.448
MATT: There's this flash of light and then this spray of

4184
03:31:38.448 --> 03:31:42.279
jagged ice, swings back for a second hit, it impacts

4185
03:31:42.279 --> 03:31:47.279
and the ice armor shatters, there's a blast of bright light,

4186
03:31:47.770 --> 03:31:51.119
a mist, it looks like a bunch of moisture

4187
03:31:51.119 --> 03:31:53.319
that just evaporates around and as the mist dissipates,

4188
03:31:53.319 --> 03:31:57.610
you see Darrow is just filled with broken pieces

4189
03:31:57.610 --> 03:32:00.629
of broken ice and frost and is now bleeding.

4190
03:32:00.629 --> 03:32:03.818
He's like, "Ho ho ho, that was very--"

4191
03:32:03.818 --> 03:32:04.889
(Travis laughs)

4192
03:32:04.889 --> 03:32:07.569
"That was very, uh, tricky.

4193
03:32:07.569 --> 03:32:09.617
"Well done. (laughs)"

4194
03:32:09.617 --> 03:32:12.950
And he's going to use the last of his turn.

4195
03:32:13.867 --> 03:32:14.700
To...

4196
03:32:16.198 --> 03:32:18.281
Hold on, let me see here.

4197
03:32:19.438 --> 03:32:21.435
LAURA: ♪ What is he going to do ♪

4198
03:32:21.435 --> 03:32:24.054
MATT: He's going, as a bonus action,
to cast Sanctuary on you.

4199
03:32:24.054 --> 03:32:26.826
(Laura gasps)

4200
03:32:26.826 --> 03:32:29.457
On himself, against you.

4201
03:32:29.457 --> 03:32:32.443
So he's like, "Oof, okay, let's try this again."

4202
03:32:32.443 --> 03:32:35.331
He takes the holy symbol there and you see a little glow,

4203
03:32:35.331 --> 03:32:37.298
you're not quite sure what it means and he's like,

4204
03:32:37.298 --> 03:32:40.686
"Okay, show me what you got."
TRAVIS: Okay.

4205
03:32:40.686 --> 03:32:44.470
I will summon the Star Razor.

4206
03:32:45.655 --> 03:32:46.790
MATT: The blade appears in your hand.

4207
03:32:46.790 --> 03:32:51.790
TRAVIS: I will use my bonus action
to cast Hexblade's Curse on him

4208
03:32:52.492 --> 03:32:57.492
and I will use one of the sword's two charges

4209
03:32:58.100 --> 03:33:01.012
to cast Faerie Fire on him.

4210
03:33:01.012 --> 03:33:02.833
MATT: Okay.

4211
03:33:02.833 --> 03:33:05.166
First, let me go ahead and--

4212
03:33:06.553 --> 03:33:08.303
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's a beast.

4213
03:33:09.771 --> 03:33:12.275
MATT: Hexblade's Curse.
ASHLEY: How often can you use that?

4214
03:33:12.275 --> 03:33:14.442
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: Once a day.

4215
03:33:15.406 --> 03:33:18.889
TRAVIS: See Invisibility and Faerie Fire.

4216
03:33:18.889 --> 03:33:21.733
TALIESIN: Faerie Fire is such a clutch spell.

4217
03:33:21.733 --> 03:33:23.112
MATT: Hexblade's Curse.

4218
03:33:23.112 --> 03:33:24.575
MARISHA: For a 1st-level spell?

4219
03:33:24.575 --> 03:33:29.164
MATT: And Faerie Fire is it a charisma saving throw?

4220
03:33:29.164 --> 03:33:32.857
TRAVIS: That is a great question, Faerie Fire

4221
03:33:32.857 --> 03:33:35.145
is a dexterity 15.

4222
03:33:35.145 --> 03:33:36.562
MATT: A dexterity 15.

4223
03:33:37.716 --> 03:33:38.787
15 exactly.

4224
03:33:38.787 --> 03:33:40.187
TRAVIS: He makes it, great.

4225
03:33:40.187 --> 03:33:41.020
MATT: Sorry.

4226
03:33:41.020 --> 03:33:42.270
TRAVIS: It's fine.

4227
03:33:42.270 --> 03:33:44.057
He's got Sanctuary up, dog.

4228
03:33:44.057 --> 03:33:44.890
MATT: He does.

4229
03:33:46.186 --> 03:33:47.377
Okay.

4230
03:33:48.927 --> 03:33:51.068
All right, is that your turn?
TRAVIS: It is.

4231
03:33:51.068 --> 03:33:53.418
MATT: All right, so that happens.

4232
03:33:53.418 --> 03:33:54.251
Okay.

4233
03:33:57.601 --> 03:34:01.472
He's now seeing some strange things. He's like--

4234
03:34:01.472 --> 03:34:05.344
going to whirl around to this side

4235
03:34:05.344 --> 03:34:06.670
to try and keep you towards the center

4236
03:34:06.670 --> 03:34:09.624
as he's backing, spinning around.

4237
03:34:09.624 --> 03:34:12.555
"You've got some tricks there, friend, some crazy bits,"

4238
03:34:12.555 --> 03:34:15.624
and he sees the shadows gathering around him.

4239
03:34:15.624 --> 03:34:16.856
"That doesn't feel good."

4240
03:34:16.856 --> 03:34:18.968
TRAVIS: (laughs) Get off!

4241
03:34:18.968 --> 03:34:21.468
MATT: "Dabbled in some weird stuff!

4242
03:34:23.427 --> 03:34:24.260
"All right.

4243
03:34:25.419 --> 03:34:26.252
"Sorry,"

4244
03:34:26.252 --> 03:34:29.985
and he's going to go ahead and, uh, I like this.

4245
03:34:29.985 --> 03:34:31.983
I like this guy.
TRAVIS: Yeah I like him, I like him.

4246
03:34:31.983 --> 03:34:35.524
MATT: He's going to go ahead and use his bonus action

4247
03:34:35.524 --> 03:34:37.753
to cast Blinding Smite.

4248
03:34:37.753 --> 03:34:38.586
TRAVIS: Okay.

4249
03:34:41.844 --> 03:34:46.394
MATT: The head of the axe glows even brighter for a second

4250
03:34:46.394 --> 03:34:49.935
and he's going to go ahead and make a swing towards you,

4251
03:34:49.935 --> 03:34:51.852
breaking his Sanctuary.

4252
03:34:54.484 --> 03:34:56.255
That is a natural 20.

4253
03:34:56.255 --> 03:34:57.514
TRAVIS: Hm-hm!
MARISHA: Jesus.

4254
03:34:57.514 --> 03:34:58.541
SAM: Ooh boy.

4255
03:34:58.541 --> 03:34:59.860
LAURA: Can you cancel it?

4256
03:34:59.860 --> 03:35:01.812
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4257
03:35:01.812 --> 03:35:04.332
SAM: Are you going to?
TALIESIN: No.

4258
03:35:04.332 --> 03:35:05.869
SAM: That's a good boy.

4259
03:35:05.869 --> 03:35:06.702
TRAVIS: I like it.

4260
03:35:06.702 --> 03:35:09.542
MATT: With that roll you take...

4261
03:35:13.230 --> 03:35:15.589
Actually, he's going to go ahead and pump his--

4262
03:35:15.589 --> 03:35:16.619
LAURA: No!

4263
03:35:16.619 --> 03:35:19.960
MATT: Second 3rd-level spell into this to Divine Smite you.

4264
03:35:19.960 --> 03:35:21.857
TRAVIS: Ooh, pally, pally!

4265
03:35:21.857 --> 03:35:23.818
MATT: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Okay, okay, okay.

4266
03:35:23.818 --> 03:35:25.928
TALIESIN: This is going to be ugly.
MATT: All right.

4267
03:35:25.928 --> 03:35:27.928
So that's going to be...

4268
03:35:31.747 --> 03:35:35.753
LAURA: Oh, and you can do that after you've hit?

4269
03:35:35.753 --> 03:35:37.270
TRAVIS: Yeah.
LAURA: He can decide?

4270
03:35:37.270 --> 03:35:38.793
Holy shit.

4271
03:35:38.793 --> 03:35:39.825
TRAVIS: It's going to be nasty.

4272
03:35:39.825 --> 03:35:41.673
LAURA: It's going to be bad, because he doubles his dice.

4273
03:35:41.673 --> 03:35:42.594
LIAM and TRAVIS: Yeah.

4274
03:35:42.594 --> 03:35:44.677
LAURA: Oof.

4275
03:35:44.677 --> 03:35:46.441
How many hit points do you have?

4276
03:35:46.441 --> 03:35:48.606
TRAVIS: 99.

4277
03:35:48.606 --> 03:35:50.689
LIAM: Not anymore, you don't.

4278
03:35:52.816 --> 03:35:54.216
TALIESIN: It's going to hurt.

4279
03:35:54.216 --> 03:35:57.915
I don't know if it's going to knock you down.

4280
03:35:57.915 --> 03:36:00.014
TRAVIS: It's going to suck.
MATT: It's going to really suck.

4281
03:36:00.014 --> 03:36:01.772
TRAVIS: What level is he doing it at?

4282
03:36:01.772 --> 03:36:03.889
MATT: It's a 3rd-level.

4283
03:36:03.889 --> 03:36:05.472
TRAVIS: 3d8s.
MATT: Okay.

4284
03:36:07.479 --> 03:36:09.748
TALIESIN: There's a lot of math coming at you, real fast.

4285
03:36:09.748 --> 03:36:11.926
TRAVIS: I know, I know, I'm waiting.

4286
03:36:11.926 --> 03:36:16.009
TALIESIN: Go a Spare the Dying ready to go just in case.

4287
03:36:17.921 --> 03:36:20.104
ASHLEY: Oh, boy, he's wincing.

4288
03:36:22.893 --> 03:36:24.226
MATT: You take...

4289
03:36:28.994 --> 03:36:30.240
92 points of...

4290
03:36:30.240 --> 03:36:32.825
ALL: Oh!

4291
03:36:32.825 --> 03:36:36.836
LAURA: How did he do 92 points of damage, how?

4292
03:36:36.836 --> 03:36:37.669
TRAVIS: Wow.

4293
03:36:37.669 --> 03:36:39.523
LAURA: How many d8s did you just roll?

4294
03:36:39.523 --> 03:36:40.565
TALIESIN: All of them!

4295
03:36:40.565 --> 03:36:42.720
MATT: He does 1d8 with his axe,

4296
03:36:42.720 --> 03:36:46.050
plus 1d8 radiant for having the paladin ability.

4297
03:36:46.050 --> 03:36:49.044
Then 3d8 radiant damage for the Blinding Smite hit,

4298
03:36:49.044 --> 03:36:52.346
which was a critical, and then a 3rd-level Divine Smite

4299
03:36:52.346 --> 03:36:56.328
as an additional 4d8 and I rolled really well,

4300
03:36:56.328 --> 03:36:58.717
and then all that got doubled, and then on top of that,

4301
03:36:58.717 --> 03:36:59.793
his bonus to damage.

4302
03:36:59.793 --> 03:37:04.186
TRAVIS: Yeah, well, he takes three points of radiant damage.

4303
03:37:04.186 --> 03:37:06.404
(laughter)

4304
03:37:06.404 --> 03:37:07.987
LIAM: That was amazing.

4305
03:37:09.621 --> 03:37:10.889
TRAVIS: (groan)

4306
03:37:10.889 --> 03:37:12.997
MATT: You guys watch as the impact hits

4307
03:37:12.997 --> 03:37:15.898
and it's like a shockwave that expands outward.

4308
03:37:15.898 --> 03:37:16.731
TRAVIS: Fuck.

4309
03:37:17.591 --> 03:37:21.037
MATT: This divine light impacts and cracks through

4310
03:37:21.037 --> 03:37:23.359
every shattered nook and cranny of Fjord's armor

4311
03:37:23.359 --> 03:37:25.919
before he's just surrounded in burning, searing light

4312
03:37:25.919 --> 03:37:28.598
and he screams out instinctually

4313
03:37:28.598 --> 03:37:32.580
like you've smote demons and sent them to other dimensions

4314
03:37:32.580 --> 03:37:34.665
for a second, you're afraid Fjord's about to tear apart

4315
03:37:34.665 --> 03:37:38.424
at the seams before it fades and leaves him smoking.

4316
03:37:38.424 --> 03:37:41.033
I also need you to make a constitution saving throw.

4317
03:37:41.033 --> 03:37:41.950
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

4318
03:37:43.203 --> 03:37:44.451
MATT: Blinding Smite, yo.

4319
03:37:44.451 --> 03:37:45.680
TRAVIS: Oh, right, the blinding part.

4320
03:37:45.680 --> 03:37:47.708
SAM: It's because you wore him out
with those push ups before.

4321
03:37:47.708 --> 03:37:48.674
TRAVIS: 13.

4322
03:37:48.674 --> 03:37:50.799
MATT: 13, you are blinded.

4323
03:37:50.799 --> 03:37:53.527
LAURA: Oh no, Fjord!

4324
03:37:53.527 --> 03:37:54.798
TRAVIS: This is a bad day.

4325
03:37:54.798 --> 03:37:57.092
LAURA: You should've canceled the crit!

4326
03:37:57.092 --> 03:37:58.069
TALIESIN: Nah.

4327
03:37:58.069 --> 03:37:59.371
(laughter)

4328
03:37:59.371 --> 03:38:00.346
TRAVIS: Oh man.

4329
03:38:00.346 --> 03:38:02.784
SAM: Oh no, Fjord's the grandpa in this fight!

4330
03:38:02.784 --> 03:38:07.532
(laughter)

4331
03:38:07.532 --> 03:38:10.232
TRAVIS: (screams)

4332
03:38:10.232 --> 03:38:12.230
MARISHA: Bust out the Noxzema!

4333
03:38:12.230 --> 03:38:14.158
MATT: I'll just put this on you.

4334
03:38:14.158 --> 03:38:15.924
SAM: Oh no.
LIAM: Caleb's just leans--

4335
03:38:15.924 --> 03:38:17.339
MATT: He's concentrating to maintain it.

4336
03:38:17.339 --> 03:38:18.739
LIAM: -- leans over to Jester and just says:

4337
03:38:18.739 --> 03:38:20.522
This is very violent.

4338
03:38:20.522 --> 03:38:22.849
LAURA: Oh gosh, this is so much worse

4339
03:38:22.849 --> 03:38:25.615
than I thought it was going to go!

4340
03:38:25.615 --> 03:38:27.668
MATT: It's until the spell--
at the end of each turn, you have to

4341
03:38:27.668 --> 03:38:29.529
make a constitution saving throw to see if it maintains.

4342
03:38:29.529 --> 03:38:31.049
TRAVIS: At the end of my turn or his?

4343
03:38:31.049 --> 03:38:32.330
MATT: At the end of your turn.
TRAVIS: Okay.

4344
03:38:32.330 --> 03:38:34.535
MATT: All right, so, that's his first strike.

4345
03:38:34.535 --> 03:38:35.772
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4346
03:38:35.772 --> 03:38:38.531
LAURA: Oh no!
MARISHA: Oh shit.

4347
03:38:38.531 --> 03:38:39.469
MATT: Because you are blinded,

4348
03:38:39.469 --> 03:38:40.807
he has advantage on the attack roll.

4349
03:38:40.807 --> 03:38:42.268
TRAVIS: Cool.

4350
03:38:42.268 --> 03:38:45.108
MATT: That is, nope.

4351
03:38:45.108 --> 03:38:46.271
LAURA: He's going to miss you.

4352
03:38:46.271 --> 03:38:48.068
LIAM: No, natural 20.
LAURA: Miss him.

4353
03:38:48.068 --> 03:38:49.479
MATT: Does a 16 hit?

4354
03:38:49.479 --> 03:38:50.312
TRAVIS: Uh, no.

4355
03:38:51.431 --> 03:38:53.931
MATT: Okay, you are fucking lucky.

4356
03:38:55.410 --> 03:38:56.738
All right, those are his two attacks.

4357
03:38:56.738 --> 03:38:58.186
MARISHA: Oh my god.

4358
03:38:58.186 --> 03:39:01.615
MATT: And he backs away a bit.

4359
03:39:01.615 --> 03:39:03.898
Actually, no, he's going to be standing there

4360
03:39:03.898 --> 03:39:08.106
and watching you just there reeling from it and be like

4361
03:39:08.106 --> 03:39:11.284
look up towards the crowd and go (laughs).

4362
03:39:11.284 --> 03:39:13.363
Rally them a bit, people go, (cheers).

4363
03:39:13.363 --> 03:39:15.283
They're going nuts, people are cheering.

4364
03:39:15.283 --> 03:39:18.664
It's crazy. It's your turn, Fjord.

4365
03:39:18.664 --> 03:39:20.783
LAURA: You can do it, Fjord!

4366
03:39:20.783 --> 03:39:22.013
LIAM: Does he have a straight roll?

4367
03:39:22.013 --> 03:39:24.556
He's Faerie Fired and Fjord is blind?

4368
03:39:24.556 --> 03:39:28.436
MATT: No, he resisted the Faerie Fire.
LIAM: He resisted it? Aw!

4369
03:39:28.436 --> 03:39:31.061
TRAVIS: 92 points.

4370
03:39:31.061 --> 03:39:32.132
MATT: Yeah, that was crazy.

4371
03:39:32.132 --> 03:39:35.849
TRAVIS: Well, that kind of changed any strategy I have.

4372
03:39:35.849 --> 03:39:39.249
All right, let's try, fuck it, right?

4373
03:39:39.249 --> 03:39:41.371
We just got to go for it.

4374
03:39:41.371 --> 03:39:45.691
With my bonus action, I will cast Banishing Smite

4375
03:39:45.691 --> 03:39:50.371
and I will take two strikes, blindly, at him.

4376
03:39:50.371 --> 03:39:51.536
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4377
03:39:51.536 --> 03:39:52.799
MATT: Go for it.

4378
03:39:52.799 --> 03:39:53.986
TRAVIS: Disadvantage?

4379
03:39:53.986 --> 03:39:56.255
MATT: So Blinding Smite, disadvantage in the attacks.

4380
03:39:56.255 --> 03:39:58.847
TALIESIN: Yeah, there's no canceling because of the hex

4381
03:39:58.847 --> 03:40:00.836
or anything like that.

4382
03:40:00.836 --> 03:40:03.210
MATT: No, he does extra damage if he hits with it.

4383
03:40:03.210 --> 03:40:04.043
LIAM: Come on.

4384
03:40:05.762 --> 03:40:08.521
TRAVIS: That is a 16 to hit.

4385
03:40:08.521 --> 03:40:12.236
MATT: You swing wide, with his shield, deflects it off to

4386
03:40:12.236 --> 03:40:14.706
the side and you feel it hit dirt.

4387
03:40:14.706 --> 03:40:15.864
TRAVIS: Cool.
LAURA: Further right!

4388
03:40:15.864 --> 03:40:17.355
Further to your right!

4389
03:40:17.355 --> 03:40:18.188
TRAVIS: Got it!

4390
03:40:19.845 --> 03:40:21.014
Ugh.

4391
03:40:21.014 --> 03:40:23.246
Three and a four.

4392
03:40:23.246 --> 03:40:25.470
LAURA: I'm sorry, I meant your left!

4393
03:40:25.470 --> 03:40:26.544
SAM: Stage right, stage right.

4394
03:40:26.544 --> 03:40:29.146
MATT: This time, you telegraph the swing and as you go wide,

4395
03:40:29.146 --> 03:40:32.586
he just looks over towards some of the group above

4396
03:40:32.586 --> 03:40:36.117
and ducks it while looking at some of the crowd watching.

4397
03:40:36.117 --> 03:40:37.647
LAURA: Oh boy.
MATT: With a bit of a smile.

4398
03:40:37.647 --> 03:40:38.538
TRAVIS: That's rude.

4399
03:40:38.538 --> 03:40:41.152
MARISHA: Fuck you, Green Knight!
TRAVIS: I missed, didn't I?

4400
03:40:41.152 --> 03:40:42.077
I missed.

4401
03:40:42.077 --> 03:40:44.546
LAURA: No, you got him, Fjord, you got him, he's dead!

4402
03:40:44.546 --> 03:40:46.418
TRAVIS: Yeah, cool.

4403
03:40:46.418 --> 03:40:50.375
MATT: Banishing Smite, do you still have concentration,

4404
03:40:50.375 --> 03:40:53.143
so you still maintain it if you can maintain concentration.

4405
03:40:53.143 --> 03:40:55.158
TRAVIS: Sure, or just stay conscious.

4406
03:40:55.158 --> 03:40:57.351
MATT: Well, make a constitution saving throw.

4407
03:40:57.351 --> 03:40:58.961
TRAVIS: Oh, right, at the end, okay.

4408
03:40:58.961 --> 03:41:01.983
MATT: To see if you can resist the blindness.

4409
03:41:01.983 --> 03:41:04.604
TRAVIS: 13.
MATT: 13, no, still blind.

4410
03:41:04.604 --> 03:41:06.516
TRAVIS: Man, this is piss-poor rolls.

4411
03:41:06.516 --> 03:41:07.788
LAURA: You used up all your luck before.

4412
03:41:07.788 --> 03:41:09.396
TRAVIS: I did, I really did.

4413
03:41:09.396 --> 03:41:12.345
MATT: His turn, he's going to shift over this way.

4414
03:41:12.345 --> 03:41:13.457
TALIESIN: Good man.

4415
03:41:13.457 --> 03:41:16.401
MATT: Lean in and be like, "Hey, are you okay, man?"

4416
03:41:16.401 --> 03:41:18.984
TRAVIS: (laughs)

4417
03:41:20.710 --> 03:41:22.935
MATT: "I feel kind of bad."

4418
03:41:22.935 --> 03:41:24.801
TRAVIS: No, just go for it, this is great, put on a show.

4419
03:41:24.801 --> 03:41:27.473
MARISHA: He is the old man, he is!

4420
03:41:27.473 --> 03:41:30.035
TRAVIS: Don't old man me, let's go. (laughs)

4421
03:41:30.035 --> 03:41:33.073
MATT: "I don't know what that means, but okay."

4422
03:41:33.073 --> 03:41:36.645
He's going to go ahead and first attack, with advantage.

4423
03:41:36.645 --> 03:41:38.117
LAURA: Oh no.

4424
03:41:38.117 --> 03:41:42.946
MARISHA: I'm going to teach Ronin pop pop as soon as I can.

4425
03:41:42.946 --> 03:41:44.435
MATT: It's a 21 to hit.

4426
03:41:44.435 --> 03:41:45.935
TRAVIS: Yeah, that hits.

4427
03:41:47.576 --> 03:41:50.785
MATT: You take double ones on 2d8.

4428
03:41:50.785 --> 03:41:53.273
Eight points of slashing damage

4429
03:41:53.273 --> 03:41:55.872
and one point of radiant damage.

4430
03:41:55.872 --> 03:41:58.232
TALIESIN: Nine points of damage.
TRAVIS: Nine points of damage.

4431
03:41:58.232 --> 03:42:01.293
You see me fall backwards, unconscious,

4432
03:42:01.293 --> 03:42:03.632
but my relentless endurance--

4433
03:42:03.632 --> 03:42:05.873
MATT: Oh, shit!
TRAVIS: The half-orc kicks in.

4434
03:42:05.873 --> 03:42:07.612
MATT: That's right, so you're still at one hit point.

4435
03:42:07.612 --> 03:42:09.680
TRAVIS: So I pop up to one hit point.

4436
03:42:09.680 --> 03:42:11.080
SAM: Yay!

4437
03:42:11.080 --> 03:42:14.580
(laughter and cheering)

4438
03:42:16.296 --> 03:42:17.907
TALIESIN: I can actually see the cartoon birds.

4439
03:42:17.907 --> 03:42:21.106
TRAVIS: And he takes two points of radiant damage.

4440
03:42:21.106 --> 03:42:22.925
MATT: Got it, all right.

4441
03:42:22.925 --> 03:42:25.515
Make a constitution saving throw

4442
03:42:25.515 --> 03:42:28.794
to see if you can maintain your smite.

4443
03:42:28.794 --> 03:42:29.733
TRAVIS: 16?

4444
03:42:29.733 --> 03:42:31.024
MATT: Yeah, you're fine.
TRAVIS: Okay.

4445
03:42:31.024 --> 03:42:32.553
MATT: Second attack, with advantage.

4446
03:42:32.553 --> 03:42:33.462
LIAM: Oh boy.

4447
03:42:33.462 --> 03:42:35.129
MATT: That's going to be...

4448
03:42:36.181 --> 03:42:37.713
20.

4449
03:42:37.713 --> 03:42:40.728
TRAVIS: (dramatic groans)

4450
03:42:40.728 --> 03:42:43.978
Yeah, that'll hit.
MATT: Yeah, that'll do.

4451
03:42:45.357 --> 03:42:46.774
Knocks you up in the air,

4452
03:42:46.774 --> 03:42:49.172
he hits you with the flat end of the battleaxe.

4453
03:42:49.172 --> 03:42:51.372
Just for sheer impact.
TALIESIN: It's a spanking.

4454
03:42:51.372 --> 03:42:56.063
MATT: Knocks you into the air, onto the ground.

4455
03:42:56.063 --> 03:43:00.489
And everyone goes like, cheering, and you see him go like,

4456
03:43:00.489 --> 03:43:03.822
"Ha-ha," but he's looking at Fjord like...

4457
03:43:05.617 --> 03:43:08.007
He throws the axe down on the ground and like,

4458
03:43:08.007 --> 03:43:11.363
reaches out and Lay Hands you for--

4459
03:43:11.363 --> 03:43:14.030
TRAVIS: (gasps)

4460
03:43:16.009 --> 03:43:18.198
MATT: He Lays Hands you for 15 hit points.

4461
03:43:18.198 --> 03:43:19.668
TRAVIS: Thank you, thank you, that's very--

4462
03:43:19.668 --> 03:43:21.489
LAURA: He's had a really bad day.
TRAVIS: Very kind of you.

4463
03:43:21.489 --> 03:43:22.634
I take it I lost?

4464
03:43:22.634 --> 03:43:24.914
MATT: And he pulls you back up, he's like, "I mean,

4465
03:43:24.914 --> 03:43:26.581
"only this much, but,

4466
03:43:27.672 --> 03:43:29.663
"some of that stuff I saw you do was pretty crazy."

4467
03:43:29.663 --> 03:43:31.273
TRAVIS: I actually had a hernia this morning

4468
03:43:31.273 --> 03:43:32.295
so, I don't want to make excuses.

4469
03:43:32.295 --> 03:43:33.950
MATT: "Oh, that explains it all, no worries."

4470
03:43:33.950 --> 03:43:35.548
He takes your hand and holds it up,

4471
03:43:35.548 --> 03:43:39.649
and he's like, "What a good job, eh, guys?"

4472
03:43:39.649 --> 03:43:40.700
ALL: Oh!

4473
03:43:40.700 --> 03:43:42.783
MATT: And Jacquel is cheering.

4474
03:43:45.601 --> 03:43:49.561
TRAVIS: Drinks on the house for the combatants?

4475
03:43:49.561 --> 03:43:51.621
MATT: "They are now, my treat!"

4476
03:43:51.621 --> 03:43:53.782
TRAVIS: Great, good, I'll be over here.

4477
03:43:53.782 --> 03:43:54.953
MATT: Everyone cheers.

4478
03:43:54.953 --> 03:43:57.699
LAURA: Let's just pretend we didn't see it happen, okay?

4479
03:43:57.699 --> 03:43:59.828
We're in the bathroom when it happened.

4480
03:43:59.828 --> 03:44:02.178
TRAVIS: I go grab the whiskey
and go up to where everyone else is.

4481
03:44:02.178 --> 03:44:05.156
Wow, that was, what did you think?

4482
03:44:05.156 --> 03:44:07.505
TALIESIN: That was amazing.
MARISHA: You did good.

4483
03:44:07.505 --> 03:44:08.896
LAURA: I was in bathroom. I missed the whole thing.

4484
03:44:08.896 --> 03:44:10.079
Did you win?

4485
03:44:10.079 --> 03:44:11.874
TRAVIS: You missed my fight?

4486
03:44:16.197 --> 03:44:17.407
LAURA: Yes.

4487
03:44:17.407 --> 03:44:18.687
(laughter)

4488
03:44:18.687 --> 03:44:23.226
TRAVIS: Oh. Well, it was a hard
fought battle, I would say.

4489
03:44:23.226 --> 03:44:26.223
Fairly-- Caleb, how would you describe it?

4490
03:44:26.223 --> 03:44:29.306
MARISHA: He did great.
LIAM: He fought valiantly.

4491
03:44:30.506 --> 03:44:33.354
LAURA: Just as I knew you would, Fjord.

4492
03:44:33.354 --> 03:44:34.273
Good job.

4493
03:44:34.273 --> 03:44:35.971
LIAM: Stick-to-itive-ness.

4494
03:44:35.971 --> 03:44:37.638
TRAVIS: Where did Nott go?

4495
03:44:38.499 --> 03:44:40.659
MARISHA: Oh, where did Nott go?

4496
03:44:40.659 --> 03:44:42.739
TRAVIS: It was because I lost.

4497
03:44:42.739 --> 03:44:46.524
LIAM: She stepped out, no, no, before the fight.

4498
03:44:46.524 --> 03:44:48.310
TRAVIS: Oh, she didn't stick around for the--

4499
03:44:48.310 --> 03:44:49.712
I'm going to back down to the bar.

4500
03:44:49.712 --> 03:44:50.820
MARISHA: I'm going to come with you!

4501
03:44:50.820 --> 03:44:53.741
TRAVIS: Yasha, please do better than I did.

4502
03:44:53.741 --> 03:44:54.683
ASHLEY: Yeah, okay.

4503
03:44:54.683 --> 03:44:57.593
MARISHA: I go get drinks with Fjord.

4504
03:44:57.593 --> 03:45:02.203
MATT: Jacquel walks back out to the center of the ring.

4505
03:45:02.203 --> 03:45:04.662
"All right, everyone, that was quite a display!

4506
03:45:04.662 --> 03:45:08.452
"Two in a row of extremely fast battles!"

4507
03:45:08.452 --> 03:45:11.785
(laughter)

4508
03:45:11.785 --> 03:45:14.751
TRAVIS: Fuck.
(laughter)

4509
03:45:14.751 --> 03:45:16.728
MATT: Long way from Grog, that was a rough one.

4510
03:45:16.728 --> 03:45:19.995
I'm sorry, but once again, you did 50 damage

4511
03:45:19.995 --> 03:45:22.248
from not even hitting him.

4512
03:45:22.248 --> 03:45:23.951
TRAVIS: Thank you, I never hit him.

4513
03:45:23.951 --> 03:45:26.078
(laughter)

4514
03:45:26.078 --> 03:45:29.166
I got to rework this strategy, I think.

4515
03:45:29.166 --> 03:45:31.625
MARISHA: You got some shit rolls.
MATT: That was some shit rolls.

4516
03:45:31.625 --> 03:45:34.125
He rolled really, really well.

4517
03:45:35.865 --> 03:45:40.238
So "For our final bout tonight,

4518
03:45:40.238 --> 03:45:45.238
"we have our returning challenged champion,

4519
03:45:45.916 --> 03:45:50.016
"of fisticuffs, here in the Stone Coffin!

4520
03:45:50.016 --> 03:45:53.804
"Can I bring out, Kal Dimmins!"

4521
03:45:53.804 --> 03:45:55.971
The crowd goes, (cheers)!
LAURA: Woo!

4522
03:46:00.141 --> 03:46:01.960
MATT: You watch as the dwarf woman sits up,

4523
03:46:01.960 --> 03:46:05.974
finishes her tankard, throws it on the ground.

4524
03:46:05.974 --> 03:46:09.703
Rolls in a circle, walks out to the center.

4525
03:46:09.703 --> 03:46:11.885
(screams)

4526
03:46:11.885 --> 03:46:14.414
(bones cracking)

4527
03:46:14.414 --> 03:46:15.545
(groaning)
LAURA: Oh, god!

4528
03:46:15.545 --> 03:46:19.302
MATT: She like cracks every part of her body.

4529
03:46:19.302 --> 03:46:20.193
MARISHA: I like it.

4530
03:46:20.193 --> 03:46:21.776
MATT: "And--"
SAM: (like Beau) I like it.

4531
03:46:22.814 --> 03:46:26.053
MATT: "The one person with the guts enough

4532
03:46:26.053 --> 03:46:28.762
"to try and take her on,

4533
03:46:28.762 --> 03:46:32.602
"Yasha from Xhorhas!"

4534
03:46:32.602 --> 03:46:34.384
Everyone's like, "Yeah!"

4535
03:46:34.384 --> 03:46:36.132
Cheering and claps.

4536
03:46:36.132 --> 03:46:38.081
TRAVIS: Let's go, Yasha!

4537
03:46:38.081 --> 03:46:40.008
MATT: You walk out, they close the door behind.

4538
03:46:40.008 --> 03:46:42.743
The medic comes up and heals you for an additional--

4539
03:46:42.743 --> 03:46:44.071
TRAVIS: Don't fucking touch me.

4540
03:46:44.071 --> 03:46:47.071
MATT: Okay, the medic turns back around.

4541
03:46:48.591 --> 03:46:52.168
ASHLEY: So warming up, hitting my muscles,

4542
03:46:52.168 --> 03:46:54.335
I lean into her and I say:

4543
03:46:55.557 --> 03:46:57.557
So you're the champion?

4544
03:46:58.499 --> 03:46:59.947
MATT: "Yeah.

4545
03:46:59.947 --> 03:47:01.909
"For a reason."

4546
03:47:01.909 --> 03:47:04.800
ASHLEY: Well, you better give them a show, then.

4547
03:47:04.800 --> 03:47:06.050
MATT: "I plan on it."

4548
03:47:09.279 --> 03:47:10.279
ASHLEY: This is...

4549
03:47:14.648 --> 03:47:16.106
MATT: You're waiting for it, you're waiting for it,

4550
03:47:16.106 --> 03:47:17.505
the room gets quiet and tense.

4551
03:47:17.505 --> 03:47:20.314
Everyone's just leaning forward over the railing.

4552
03:47:20.314 --> 03:47:23.512
All the breath leaves the chamber,

4553
03:47:23.512 --> 03:47:24.929
as Jacquel goes...

4554
03:47:28.362 --> 03:47:31.087
"Begin!" Roll initiative.

4555
03:47:32.441 --> 03:47:34.349
LAURA: Go, Yasha! Oh!

4556
03:47:34.349 --> 03:47:36.060
Get it out of your system.
ASHLEY: So I get advantage.

4557
03:47:36.060 --> 03:47:38.027
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: You do.

4558
03:47:40.704 --> 03:47:41.770
LIAM: One of you wins fucking initiative--

4559
03:47:41.770 --> 03:47:42.740
ASHLEY: Six.

4560
03:47:42.740 --> 03:47:43.573
MATT: Six, oh.

4561
03:47:44.601 --> 03:47:46.598
MARISHA: With advantage?

4562
03:47:46.598 --> 03:47:48.296
ASHLEY: Yep.
MARISHA: Oh no.

4563
03:47:48.296 --> 03:47:50.685
MATT: Kal goes first.
MARISHA: Oh no!

4564
03:47:50.685 --> 03:47:52.304
TALIESIN: Oh no.
MARISHA: Yeah, we all lost advantage.

4565
03:47:52.304 --> 03:47:54.965
MATT: You all lost initiative.

4566
03:47:54.965 --> 03:47:58.925
Kal goes (grunts) and bites her lower lip

4567
03:47:58.925 --> 03:48:02.295
before charging towards you, bonus action, goes into a rage.

4568
03:48:02.295 --> 03:48:03.762
Frenzied rage.

4569
03:48:04.668 --> 03:48:05.940
TRAVIS: Frenzied rage, three attacks.

4570
03:48:05.940 --> 03:48:07.515
MATT: Yeah.

4571
03:48:09.147 --> 03:48:10.627
So just so you're aware here,

4572
03:48:10.627 --> 03:48:13.737
fists, and for a standard of this, are just one damage

4573
03:48:13.737 --> 03:48:16.264
plus your strength modifier plus whatever your rage bonus

4574
03:48:16.264 --> 03:48:17.945
and everything else would be.

4575
03:48:17.945 --> 03:48:19.474
So just keep that in mind.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

4576
03:48:19.474 --> 03:48:23.085
MATT: So running forward, (grunts) reckless attack on you,

4577
03:48:23.085 --> 03:48:26.066
with advantage, out of the gate, all three attacks,

4578
03:48:26.066 --> 03:48:27.504
or no, two attacks, because the bonus action

4579
03:48:27.504 --> 03:48:31.822
was used to rage, so just two attacks on you.

4580
03:48:31.822 --> 03:48:32.996
Natural 20.

4581
03:48:32.996 --> 03:48:34.035
LIAM: Oh!

4582
03:48:34.035 --> 03:48:36.185
MATT: Which means it's now two damage and the die,

4583
03:48:36.185 --> 03:48:37.536
it doesn't do much, criticals in a fist fight

4584
03:48:37.536 --> 03:48:40.905
don't do too much, unless you're a monk.

4585
03:48:40.905 --> 03:48:43.033
So it's going to be seven points of bludgeoning damage

4586
03:48:43.033 --> 03:48:45.033
in the first hit.
ASHLEY: Okay.

4587
03:48:46.584 --> 03:48:49.787
MATT: Second attack is going to be, oh, not good!

4588
03:48:49.787 --> 03:48:50.865
11.

4589
03:48:50.865 --> 03:48:52.241
ASHLEY: Okay.

4590
03:48:52.241 --> 03:48:54.879
TALIESIN: Not 11 damage, just--
MATT: No, 11 to hit.

4591
03:48:54.879 --> 03:48:56.659
ASHLEY: Oh oh, no, that doesn't hit.

4592
03:48:56.659 --> 03:48:58.809
MATT: Yeah, I rolled a one and a two.

4593
03:48:58.809 --> 03:49:00.328
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

4594
03:49:00.328 --> 03:49:02.558
MATT: Oh, that's it, that's it for this round.

4595
03:49:02.558 --> 03:49:07.558
And it's just, at this point, finishes-- (grunts)

4596
03:49:07.654 --> 03:49:09.294
"Come at me."

4597
03:49:09.294 --> 03:49:11.127
It's your turn.
ASHLEY: Okay.

4598
03:49:12.216 --> 03:49:13.801
MATT: She's grinning through it.

4599
03:49:13.801 --> 03:49:15.171
LAURA: Wait, are you going to rage?

4600
03:49:15.171 --> 03:49:17.521
I'm sorry.
ASHLEY: No.

4601
03:49:17.521 --> 03:49:19.504
That is a, a...

4602
03:49:21.175 --> 03:49:23.004
TRAVIS: You have advantage, because she does--

4603
03:49:23.004 --> 03:49:24.485
MATT: Yeah, you have advantage
on your attacks against her.

4604
03:49:24.485 --> 03:49:26.038
Are you raging first or are you?

4605
03:49:26.038 --> 03:49:28.455
ASHLEY: No.
MATT: No, interesting, okay.

4606
03:49:29.668 --> 03:49:31.198
ASHLEY: That's better.

4607
03:49:31.198 --> 03:49:33.877
That would be a 21 to hit.

4608
03:49:33.877 --> 03:49:35.376
MATT: That hits.

4609
03:49:35.376 --> 03:49:36.516
ASHLEY: And I just look at her,

4610
03:49:36.516 --> 03:49:38.295
and I back hand her across the face.

4611
03:49:38.295 --> 03:49:40.196
MATT: (surprised laugh)

4612
03:49:40.196 --> 03:49:42.105
Okay, that still does the damage.

4613
03:49:42.105 --> 03:49:43.852
So it's one damage plus your strength modifier.

4614
03:49:43.852 --> 03:49:46.578
TRAVIS: I love it.
ASHLEY: So four, yeah.

4615
03:49:46.578 --> 03:49:49.010
MATT: Four, reduced, because she's raging, to two.

4616
03:49:49.010 --> 03:49:50.176
ASHLEY: Great.

4617
03:49:51.035 --> 03:49:54.146
MATT: All right, you have your second attack, if you want.

4618
03:49:54.146 --> 03:49:55.186
ASHLEY: Yep.

4619
03:49:55.186 --> 03:49:56.255
MATT: So you just.

4620
03:49:56.255 --> 03:49:57.824
LAURA: Advantage.
ASHLEY: Advantage.

4621
03:49:57.824 --> 03:50:00.324
Okay, that is good, that is...

4622
03:50:03.034 --> 03:50:04.612
Yeah, okay.

4623
03:50:04.612 --> 03:50:08.004
Oh, shit, the first one was 16.

4624
03:50:08.004 --> 03:50:09.031
23 to hit.

4625
03:50:09.031 --> 03:50:11.829
MATT: Hits, roll damage, or not roll damage for this one,

4626
03:50:11.829 --> 03:50:14.149
because this is just the-- add another--

4627
03:50:14.149 --> 03:50:15.792
ASHLEY: I do it again, with my other hand.

4628
03:50:15.792 --> 03:50:17.200
MATT: Damn.
MARISHA: Oh!

4629
03:50:17.200 --> 03:50:19.362
MATT: So four points it is.

4630
03:50:19.362 --> 03:50:21.941
TRAVIS: Foregoing the rage damage.

4631
03:50:21.941 --> 03:50:23.063
MATT: (snarls)

4632
03:50:23.063 --> 03:50:25.221
MARISHA: It's like Laura Bailey
leaving the Game awards.

4633
03:50:25.221 --> 03:50:28.114
MATT: Everyone in the crowd
goes like, "Oh, what!"

4634
03:50:28.114 --> 03:50:30.284
The room gets really loud and really quiet

4635
03:50:30.284 --> 03:50:32.660
as she's like... (snarls)

4636
03:50:32.660 --> 03:50:34.751
LIAM: Fuck it, I did it.

4637
03:50:34.751 --> 03:50:39.191
MATT: (grunts) And jumps at you,
like a feral beast.

4638
03:50:39.191 --> 03:50:40.639
LAURA: Oh, gosh.

4639
03:50:40.639 --> 03:50:43.921
MATT: Now, for this attack,
not fists, but fingernails,

4640
03:50:43.921 --> 03:50:47.682
is going to scratch towards your face.

4641
03:50:47.682 --> 03:50:50.682
Going reckless again, three attacks.

4642
03:50:53.162 --> 03:50:54.565
Natural 20.

4643
03:50:54.565 --> 03:50:58.471
Once again, I know, this dice is rolling really well,

4644
03:50:58.471 --> 03:51:00.466
but it's still seven points of bludgeoning damage.

4645
03:51:00.466 --> 03:51:01.573
ASHLEY: Okay.

4646
03:51:01.573 --> 03:51:03.798
MATT: Second one is going to be...

4647
03:51:04.850 --> 03:51:08.541
25 to hit, and six points of bludgeoning damage.

4648
03:51:08.541 --> 03:51:12.280
And that bonus action third strike is going to be

4649
03:51:12.280 --> 03:51:14.421
only a 14 to hit.

4650
03:51:14.421 --> 03:51:16.141
ASHLEY: That does not hit.
MATT: Third one misses.

4651
03:51:16.141 --> 03:51:18.623
So in the air, leaps and the first one claws

4652
03:51:18.623 --> 03:51:20.413
across your face.

4653
03:51:20.413 --> 03:51:25.213
And scratches while the hand
grabs the front of your tunic

4654
03:51:25.213 --> 03:51:28.185
area and holds on, feet planted up on your chest,

4655
03:51:28.185 --> 03:51:29.644
the other hand comes down

4656
03:51:29.644 --> 03:51:32.015
and attempts to gouge into your eye

4657
03:51:32.015 --> 03:51:35.065
and you pull back and she scratches across your face.

4658
03:51:35.065 --> 03:51:37.207
Now you have scratches on
both sides of your face

4659
03:51:37.207 --> 03:51:40.675
and the third time, goes to try
and come down and pummel you

4660
03:51:40.675 --> 03:51:44.513
and you just push her off and
she lands back onto her legs.

4661
03:51:44.513 --> 03:51:46.483
(snarls and pants)

4662
03:51:46.483 --> 03:51:48.483
She looks like she's going crazy.

4663
03:51:48.483 --> 03:51:51.001
It's your turn.

4664
03:51:51.001 --> 03:51:52.001
ASHLEY: All right.

4665
03:51:53.134 --> 03:51:55.972
LAURA: You get advantage,
because she's reckless attacking.

4666
03:51:55.972 --> 03:51:57.262
ASHLEY: Okay, 21 to hit.

4667
03:51:57.262 --> 03:51:58.665
MATT: That hits.

4668
03:51:58.665 --> 03:52:00.082
ASHLEY: Okay, so, um...

4669
03:52:04.105 --> 03:52:06.121
I--
MATT: Still holding back on your rage?

4670
03:52:06.121 --> 03:52:07.284
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

4671
03:52:08.392 --> 03:52:10.093
SAM: But, but why?

4672
03:52:10.093 --> 03:52:10.926
LAURA: But why?

4673
03:52:10.926 --> 03:52:15.815
ASHLEY: I push her and I get
really close to her and I say:

4674
03:52:15.815 --> 03:52:17.831
Is that all you got?

4675
03:52:18.964 --> 03:52:20.748
MATT: Are you using your action
to shove her or are you

4676
03:52:20.748 --> 03:52:24.028
using your action to make
an intimidation check?

4677
03:52:24.028 --> 03:52:26.513
ASHLEY: No, I'm just saying that
to her and then I push her.

4678
03:52:26.513 --> 03:52:28.622
MATT: Okay, are you doing damage with the push

4679
03:52:28.622 --> 03:52:30.313
or just pushing her?

4680
03:52:30.313 --> 03:52:31.473
ASHLEY: No.

4681
03:52:31.473 --> 03:52:32.961
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: <i>Just</i> pushing her?

4682
03:52:32.961 --> 03:52:33.998
ASHLEY: Just pushing her.

4683
03:52:33.998 --> 03:52:36.748
MATT: Make an athletics check.
ASHLEY: Okay.

4684
03:52:38.401 --> 03:52:39.984
SAM: Cocky, I like it.

4685
03:52:43.459 --> 03:52:45.100
ASHLEY: 22.

4686
03:52:45.100 --> 03:52:45.933
MATT: Okay.

4687
03:52:49.198 --> 03:52:51.292
Double check something here real fast.

4688
03:52:51.292 --> 03:52:54.180
LAURA: What's this Yasha doing?

4689
03:52:54.180 --> 03:52:57.196
SAM: She's killing her with kindness.

4690
03:52:57.196 --> 03:52:58.879
LIAM: Backhands and kindness.

4691
03:53:01.244 --> 03:53:02.939
MATT: Do you want to push her
five feet away with your push

4692
03:53:02.939 --> 03:53:04.972
or knock her prone?

4693
03:53:04.972 --> 03:53:06.651
ASHLEY: Just push her five feet away.

4694
03:53:06.651 --> 03:53:09.220
MATT: Okay, so you push her five feet back.

4695
03:53:09.220 --> 03:53:10.412
That's your first strike.

4696
03:53:10.412 --> 03:53:13.164
You can move in closer, if you want to.

4697
03:53:13.164 --> 03:53:16.492
ASHLEY: Yeah, oh yeah, so I can attack.

4698
03:53:16.492 --> 03:53:17.742
LAURA: At advantage.

4699
03:53:18.600 --> 03:53:20.340
ASHLEY: Nope, doesn't hit.

4700
03:53:20.340 --> 03:53:21.332
Nothing.
MATT: Okay.

4701
03:53:21.332 --> 03:53:22.642
So the second time you move forward,

4702
03:53:22.642 --> 03:53:23.953
and you try and slap her again?

4703
03:53:23.953 --> 03:53:24.786
ASHLEY: Yeah.

4704
03:53:24.786 --> 03:53:27.700
MATT: You slap and she catches your wrist

4705
03:53:27.700 --> 03:53:30.447
and you see her eye twitching.

4706
03:53:30.447 --> 03:53:32.446
Not able to understand and really figure out

4707
03:53:32.446 --> 03:53:34.295
what you're about, and everyone's like,

4708
03:53:34.295 --> 03:53:35.614
"Oh, shit!"

4709
03:53:35.614 --> 03:53:38.334
You pull her hand back and break her grip.

4710
03:53:38.334 --> 03:53:39.834
It's now her turn.

4711
03:53:41.114 --> 03:53:42.929
Yeah, she's going all-in again,
three more strikes.

4712
03:53:42.929 --> 03:53:46.039
She's going to leap over you and land behind you

4713
03:53:46.039 --> 03:53:48.036
and try and get onto your back and begin trying to

4714
03:53:48.036 --> 03:53:50.207
pull away and pummel the back
and sides of your head,

4715
03:53:50.207 --> 03:53:52.941
just boxing you from over top.

4716
03:53:52.941 --> 03:53:54.831
That's going to be a 24 to hit.

4717
03:53:54.831 --> 03:53:57.107
ASHLEY: Yep.
MATT: You take six points of bludgeoning damage.

4718
03:53:57.107 --> 03:53:57.940
SAM: No.

4719
03:54:03.074 --> 03:54:05.047
MATT: Seven points of bludgeoning damage.

4720
03:54:05.047 --> 03:54:06.338
ASHLEY: Yep.
SAM: Oh no!

4721
03:54:06.338 --> 03:54:09.006
MATT: And that's a...

4722
03:54:09.006 --> 03:54:10.092
17 to hit?

4723
03:54:10.092 --> 03:54:11.710
ASHLEY: Yep, just hits.

4724
03:54:11.710 --> 03:54:16.293
MATT: Yeah, you take another six
points bludgeoning damage.

4725
03:54:18.880 --> 03:54:20.147
ASHLEY: With that,

4726
03:54:21.236 --> 03:54:22.069
bloodied,

4727
03:54:24.121 --> 03:54:25.687
I finally start to smile,

4728
03:54:25.687 --> 03:54:27.818
which you haven't seen in a while.

4729
03:54:28.760 --> 03:54:30.427
Okay.
SAM: She just wants to get beat up.

4730
03:54:30.427 --> 03:54:33.307
This is some weird sick thing.

4731
03:54:33.307 --> 03:54:35.998
ASHLEY: 19 plus seven.

4732
03:54:35.998 --> 03:54:38.960
26, yeah, 26.

4733
03:54:38.960 --> 03:54:41.072
MATT: That definitely hits.

4734
03:54:41.072 --> 03:54:44.310
ASHLEY: She's still on my back?
MATT: Yep.

4735
03:54:44.310 --> 03:54:46.432
ASHLEY: I just shove her off onto the ground.

4736
03:54:46.432 --> 03:54:47.310
MATT: Just pull her off onto the ground?

4737
03:54:47.310 --> 03:54:48.280
ASHLEY: Yeah.

4738
03:54:48.280 --> 03:54:50.336
MATT: Slamming her onto the ground,
doing two points of damage?

4739
03:54:50.336 --> 03:54:51.169
ASHLEY: Yeah.

4740
03:54:51.169 --> 03:54:55.744
MATT: Would be four, but two
because she's raging, still.

4741
03:54:55.744 --> 03:54:58.032
Onto the ground now, arms and legs are curled up in

4742
03:54:58.032 --> 03:55:00.694
a defensive position, almost like a spider knocked

4743
03:55:00.694 --> 03:55:02.620
onto its back, what are you doing?

4744
03:55:02.620 --> 03:55:03.630
ASHLEY: Second attack.

4745
03:55:03.630 --> 03:55:07.124
MATT: Yeah, what are you doing for the second attack?

4746
03:55:07.124 --> 03:55:09.086
ASHLEY: It hits, it hits, it's 20.

4747
03:55:09.086 --> 03:55:10.396
Total, well, 20 total?

4748
03:55:10.396 --> 03:55:12.577
MATT: That hits, yeah.
ASHLEY: Okay.

4749
03:55:12.577 --> 03:55:16.185
I'm going to kick her in her side.

4750
03:55:16.185 --> 03:55:18.436
MATT: Crack into that bit there, all right.

4751
03:55:18.436 --> 03:55:20.924
That's another two points of damage.

4752
03:55:20.924 --> 03:55:22.543
All righty, is that your turn?

4753
03:55:22.543 --> 03:55:23.593
ASHLEY: That's my turn.

4754
03:55:23.593 --> 03:55:26.441
MATT: All right, after being
thrown over and onto her back,

4755
03:55:26.441 --> 03:55:29.090
she gets back up, growls loudly.

4756
03:55:29.090 --> 03:55:31.087
(growls dramatically)

4757
03:55:31.087 --> 03:55:35.039
Is going to go ahead and flank around to the side

4758
03:55:35.039 --> 03:55:37.308
and is going to attempt to swing to pick you up

4759
03:55:37.308 --> 03:55:38.141
to throw you on the ground.

4760
03:55:38.141 --> 03:55:40.057
She's going to make a shove attack.

4761
03:55:40.057 --> 03:55:42.011
Make an athletics check.

4762
03:55:46.297 --> 03:55:47.366
ASHLEY: 16?

4763
03:55:47.366 --> 03:55:51.161
MATT: She rolled a 16, they both
got even, let me see what--

4764
03:55:51.161 --> 03:55:55.022
LAURA: Is this like a game of War,
and then you go again?

4765
03:55:55.022 --> 03:55:57.037
MATT: We'll see, we'll see.

4766
03:55:57.037 --> 03:55:58.454
MARISHA: Who's quickest?

4767
03:56:00.596 --> 03:56:02.480
MATT: It says it's athletics versus athletics.

4768
03:56:02.480 --> 03:56:03.480
TRAVIS: Oh, right.

4769
03:56:09.134 --> 03:56:12.516
MATT: Succeed would be equaling, but defense,

4770
03:56:12.516 --> 03:56:14.916
no, so yeah, so you get knocked prone.

4771
03:56:14.916 --> 03:56:16.326
She grabs and sweeps you up

4772
03:56:16.326 --> 03:56:19.884
and slams you onto the ground so
you're knocked prone there.

4773
03:56:19.884 --> 03:56:22.257
The second strike, she's going
to bring both her fists up

4774
03:56:22.257 --> 03:56:24.777
(grunts) and gorilla slam on top of you,

4775
03:56:24.777 --> 03:56:28.145
with advantage, because you were prone.

4776
03:56:28.145 --> 03:56:30.203
That'll be 25,

4777
03:56:30.203 --> 03:56:34.534
so you take six points of bludgeoning damage again.

4778
03:56:34.534 --> 03:56:37.784
And bonus action, go for a second slam.

4779
03:56:39.577 --> 03:56:41.044
That is a 20 to hit.

4780
03:56:41.044 --> 03:56:41.877
ASHLEY: That hits.

4781
03:56:41.877 --> 03:56:44.933
MATT: Six points of bludgeoning damage.

4782
03:56:44.933 --> 03:56:47.003
As you are just being pummeled into the ground.

4783
03:56:47.003 --> 03:56:48.462
You watch every impact,

4784
03:56:48.462 --> 03:56:52.290
there's now foam curling at the corners of Kal's mouth.

4785
03:56:52.290 --> 03:56:55.622
With every hit, the rocks nearby surrounding

4786
03:56:55.622 --> 03:57:00.622
the point of impact shake and scatter a bit.

4787
03:57:01.412 --> 03:57:02.253
That's your turn.

4788
03:57:02.253 --> 03:57:04.741
ASHLEY: Okay, so I would like
to try, from the ground,

4789
03:57:04.741 --> 03:57:08.808
as she's going down, to grab her wrists

4790
03:57:08.808 --> 03:57:12.059
and try to bring her close to me.

4791
03:57:12.059 --> 03:57:13.689
MATT: So you're going to grapple her?

4792
03:57:13.689 --> 03:57:14.606
ASHLEY: Yeah, 17.

4793
03:57:16.139 --> 03:57:17.759
MATT: 17?
ASHLEY: Or well, I guess--

4794
03:57:17.759 --> 03:57:18.720
MATT: Is this a grapple you're trying to?

4795
03:57:18.720 --> 03:57:19.749
You don't have advantage on this

4796
03:57:19.749 --> 03:57:20.760
because she didn't reckless attack on you.

4797
03:57:20.760 --> 03:57:22.560
ASHLEY: Okay, I rolled 10 for both.

4798
03:57:22.560 --> 03:57:23.393
MATT: Okay.

4799
03:57:23.393 --> 03:57:25.624
ASHLEY: So what do I add to that, then?

4800
03:57:25.624 --> 03:57:27.467
MATT: If you're trying to grapple her? Athletics check.

4801
03:57:27.467 --> 03:57:29.800
ASHLEY: Athletics check, 17, same.

4802
03:57:30.787 --> 03:57:33.766
MATT: She has advantage on it because she's raging.

4803
03:57:33.766 --> 03:57:35.668
But still rolls only a 15.

4804
03:57:35.668 --> 03:57:37.289
So you do, you have her grappled now.

4805
03:57:37.289 --> 03:57:38.868
You are the ground, you reach up,

4806
03:57:38.868 --> 03:57:41.518
and you have her held to you
with your first attack.

4807
03:57:41.518 --> 03:57:46.360
ASHLEY: So when I grab her
by her wrists, I pull her close,

4808
03:57:46.360 --> 03:57:49.989
and I say: You are fucking weak.

4809
03:57:49.989 --> 03:57:51.301
Then I push her away.

4810
03:57:51.301 --> 03:57:52.288
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

4811
03:57:52.288 --> 03:57:54.130
LAURA: Oh my god, Yasha's so hardcore.

4812
03:57:54.130 --> 03:57:55.305
MARISHA: I know!

4813
03:57:56.916 --> 03:57:59.122
LIAM: Orphan Maker!

4814
03:57:59.122 --> 03:58:00.666
MATT: Use your strength for it, if you want to.

4815
03:58:00.666 --> 03:58:02.226
ASHLEY: Okay, 19.

4816
03:58:02.226 --> 03:58:03.059
MATT: 19.

4817
03:58:05.527 --> 03:58:07.154
Natural fucking one.

4818
03:58:07.154 --> 03:58:08.237
ALL: Oh!

4819
03:58:09.183 --> 03:58:11.466
MATT: As you push her away,
she is frightened of you

4820
03:58:11.466 --> 03:58:14.282
and backs away and is like (pants)

4821
03:58:14.282 --> 03:58:15.422
and looks up at everyone around her.

4822
03:58:15.422 --> 03:58:19.654
Everyone's like leaning in and going,
what is happening?

4823
03:58:19.654 --> 03:58:22.632
She's... (pants)

4824
03:58:22.632 --> 03:58:24.775
SAM: Yeah.
MATT: (pants)

4825
03:58:24.775 --> 03:58:27.277
It's her turn and she steps back,

4826
03:58:27.277 --> 03:58:29.296
and steps back to about 10 feet away from you.

4827
03:58:29.296 --> 03:58:31.018
TRAVIS and MARISHA: She's frightened.

4828
03:58:31.018 --> 03:58:32.727
Holy shit!
LAURA: Oh my god!

4829
03:58:32.727 --> 03:58:34.468
TRAVIS: She's going to lose her rage.
LIAM: Spooked her.

4830
03:58:34.468 --> 03:58:38.051
LAURA: (gasps)
MARISHA: Oh my god!

4831
03:58:40.613 --> 03:58:42.055
MATT: All right, it's your turn.

4832
03:58:42.055 --> 03:58:43.215
ASHLEY: Okay.

4833
03:58:43.215 --> 03:58:44.048
MATT: So...

4834
03:58:45.543 --> 03:58:49.583
Technically, the grapple, I think is...

4835
03:58:49.583 --> 03:58:52.762
This is very different than I was expecting.

4836
03:58:52.762 --> 03:58:54.653
To make a grapple is an attack
so it does maintain the rage.

4837
03:58:54.653 --> 03:58:57.323
She would have to not attack her this round,

4838
03:58:57.323 --> 03:58:59.149
to have the rage dropped.
ASHLEY: Or not be hit.

4839
03:58:59.149 --> 03:59:01.016
MATT: Or not be hit, yeah.

4840
03:59:01.016 --> 03:59:03.377
TRAVIS: But she can be frightened while she's raging?

4841
03:59:03.377 --> 03:59:04.617
MATT: She can be frightened, yeah.

4842
03:59:04.617 --> 03:59:06.786
Well, actually, let me double check that.

4843
03:59:06.786 --> 03:59:09.383
LIAM: Think how crazy this
would be if it was an old man.

4844
03:59:09.383 --> 03:59:12.249
(laughter)
ASHLEY: That would be so mean.

4845
03:59:12.249 --> 03:59:14.891
LIAM: Is that all you've got?

4846
03:59:14.891 --> 03:59:16.869
MARISHA: You're weak!

4847
03:59:16.869 --> 03:59:18.068
ASHLEY: You're old!

4848
03:59:18.068 --> 03:59:19.546
(laughter)

4849
03:59:19.546 --> 03:59:21.654
LIAM: I came for rice pudding!

4850
03:59:21.654 --> 03:59:24.944
MATT: Okay, I will say, because
she is a frenzy barbarian,

4851
03:59:24.944 --> 03:59:27.432
she is immune to frightened while raging.

4852
03:59:27.432 --> 03:59:29.222
LAURA: Oh, got it, okay.

4853
03:59:29.222 --> 03:59:32.262
MATT: So she's not frightened of you,

4854
03:59:32.262 --> 03:59:34.920
but you're still seeing a reaction out of her,

4855
03:59:34.920 --> 03:59:37.691
like the frightened condition hasn't broken through,

4856
03:59:37.691 --> 03:59:40.656
she's not backing away so much,
but she's definitely like,

4857
03:59:40.656 --> 03:59:42.163
she can't figure you out,

4858
03:59:42.163 --> 03:59:44.186
and in the middle of that blind feral rage,

4859
03:59:44.186 --> 03:59:47.125
you're cutting through a bit.

4860
03:59:47.125 --> 03:59:51.125
So then on her turn, she is going to attack you.

4861
03:59:53.258 --> 03:59:56.993
Will not be reckless, because of that, I'll say.

4862
03:59:56.993 --> 03:59:59.257
That's going to be a 21 to hit.

4863
03:59:59.257 --> 04:00:01.786
ASHLEY: That hits.
MATT: So six points of bludgeoning

4864
04:00:01.786 --> 04:00:03.619
And an 11, miss?

4865
04:00:03.619 --> 04:00:06.036
ASHLEY: That misses.
MATT: Bonus action.

4866
04:00:07.371 --> 04:00:09.364
I take it you used your turn
on your turn to get up, right?

4867
04:00:09.364 --> 04:00:10.590
ASHLEY: Yeah.

4868
04:00:10.590 --> 04:00:15.110
MATT: And then the third strike
will be-- that's cocked.

4869
04:00:15.110 --> 04:00:16.121
Natural one.

4870
04:00:16.121 --> 04:00:17.150
LAURA: Oh, shit.

4871
04:00:17.150 --> 04:00:20.940
MATT: So like, claw, punch. (pants)

4872
04:00:20.940 --> 04:00:23.281
LAURA: You've broken the streak, Yasha.

4873
04:00:23.281 --> 04:00:25.663
The 20s are gone.
MATT: Your turn.

4874
04:00:25.663 --> 04:00:30.246
ASHLEY: Okay, so I walk up to her,
and I go up to attack her.

4875
04:00:32.044 --> 04:00:33.340
Oh, I don't have advantage, right?

4876
04:00:33.340 --> 04:00:35.441
MATT: No, she didn't do reckless this turn.

4877
04:00:35.441 --> 04:00:36.601
ASHLEY: 16?

4878
04:00:36.601 --> 04:00:38.909
MATT: 16 just hits.
TRAVIS: You could go reckless, if you want it.

4879
04:00:38.909 --> 04:00:40.450
ASHLEY: Oh, that's true.

4880
04:00:40.450 --> 04:00:42.727
Well, that hits.

4881
04:00:42.727 --> 04:00:44.195
ASHLEY: Oh, yeah, I'm going to go reckless.

4882
04:00:44.195 --> 04:00:45.028
MATT: Okay.

4883
04:00:46.424 --> 04:00:49.341
ASHLEY: Thank you. 17, so that hits.

4884
04:00:49.341 --> 04:00:51.566
But she will have advantage now.

4885
04:00:52.824 --> 04:00:54.491
So I am going to...

4886
04:00:56.795 --> 04:01:00.571
Punch her in her stomach,
but I'm going to pull the punch

4887
04:01:00.571 --> 04:01:02.011
but the crowd won't notice that.

4888
04:01:02.011 --> 04:01:04.222
MATT: So not doing any damage?
ASHLEY: So-- no.

4889
04:01:04.222 --> 04:01:07.519
MATT: All right, so, she reacts from the blow

4890
04:01:07.519 --> 04:01:09.780
and looks confused.

4891
04:01:09.780 --> 04:01:11.250
That's your first attack.

4892
04:01:11.250 --> 04:01:14.988
SAM: Maybe she's just trying to
make Fjord feel better?

4893
04:01:14.988 --> 04:01:17.102
TRAVIS: You're not there.

4894
04:01:17.102 --> 04:01:19.110
SAM: You don't know.

4895
04:01:19.110 --> 04:01:20.774
ASHLEY: Yeah, that hits, a 25.

4896
04:01:20.774 --> 04:01:21.607
MATT: 25.

4897
04:01:23.534 --> 04:01:27.416
You pulled the one punch
back and she's like-- (pants)

4898
04:01:27.416 --> 04:01:29.532
ASHLEY: And then I smack her again.

4899
04:01:29.532 --> 04:01:30.783
MATT: For another two damage?

4900
04:01:30.783 --> 04:01:32.201
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MATT: All right.

4901
04:01:32.201 --> 04:01:33.669
SAM: You're nothin'!

4902
04:01:33.669 --> 04:01:35.057
MATT: She's got a little bit of curled blood

4903
04:01:35.057 --> 04:01:37.797
at the corner of her mouth
from the slap which hits.

4904
04:01:37.797 --> 04:01:40.714
(breathes heavily)

4905
04:01:42.757 --> 04:01:44.418
ASHLEY: What are you waiting for?

4906
04:01:44.418 --> 04:01:46.309
MATT: (grunts) And she leaps towards you,

4907
04:01:46.309 --> 04:01:48.328
puts her hands around your neck

4908
04:01:48.328 --> 04:01:52.561
and is going for a strangle,
from a thematic standpoint.

4909
04:01:53.429 --> 04:01:55.192
With advantage, that definitely hits.

4910
04:01:55.192 --> 04:01:57.076
Six points of bludgeoning as she's pushing

4911
04:01:57.076 --> 04:01:59.243
in towards your wind pipe.

4912
04:02:01.268 --> 04:02:02.687
19 to hit?

4913
04:02:02.687 --> 04:02:04.247
Another six points of bludgeoning damage

4914
04:02:04.247 --> 04:02:06.978
and another bonus action, 21 to hit,

4915
04:02:06.978 --> 04:02:09.286
so it's another-- so three,

4916
04:02:09.286 --> 04:02:13.015
so it's 18 points of bludgeoning damage this round

4917
04:02:13.015 --> 04:02:15.418
as she's now on top of you.

4918
04:02:15.418 --> 04:02:17.727
You're strong enough to hold your weight

4919
04:02:17.727 --> 04:02:20.100
and you're having to go on
your back foot to hold it,

4920
04:02:20.100 --> 04:02:23.060
but she's pounced on you like a creature

4921
04:02:23.060 --> 04:02:24.690
and is just like pushing in your windpipe

4922
04:02:24.690 --> 04:02:27.330
while looking through your
eyes with absolute fury.

4923
04:02:27.330 --> 04:02:29.163
It's your turn.
ASHLEY: Okay.

4924
04:02:31.420 --> 04:02:34.271
Let's see, yeah, 18, good.

4925
04:02:34.271 --> 04:02:37.389
Okay, so, 25 to hit again.

4926
04:02:37.389 --> 04:02:38.442
MATT: Definitely hits, what do you do?

4927
04:02:38.442 --> 04:02:40.439
ASHLEY: So she's in front of me?
MATT: Yeah.

4928
04:02:40.439 --> 04:02:44.684
ASHLEY: So I would like to run up against the bars--

4929
04:02:44.684 --> 04:02:46.067
(Laura gasps)

4930
04:02:46.067 --> 04:02:48.272
and push her up against the wall.

4931
04:02:48.272 --> 04:02:50.010
LAURA: While she's strangling you?

4932
04:02:50.010 --> 04:02:50.843
ASHLEY: Yeah.

4933
04:02:50.843 --> 04:02:51.730
MATT: All right.

4934
04:02:51.730 --> 04:02:54.805
Just make a strength check for me,
if you don't mind.

4935
04:02:56.759 --> 04:02:57.978
ASHLEY: Not good.

4936
04:02:57.978 --> 04:02:59.020
MATT: It's okay, she didn't get good, either.

4937
04:02:59.020 --> 04:03:00.187
ASHLEY: Five.
MATT: Five?

4938
04:03:01.258 --> 04:03:02.218
SAM: Total?

4939
04:03:02.218 --> 04:03:04.068
ASHLEY: Total, I rolled a two.

4940
04:03:04.068 --> 04:03:05.357
MATT: Technically, she still wins.

4941
04:03:05.357 --> 04:03:07.446
So you go to pull her around on that first strike

4942
04:03:07.446 --> 04:03:11.067
and as you go to push, she actually pulls her leg

4943
04:03:11.067 --> 04:03:13.129
off of your chest and puts it behind

4944
04:03:13.129 --> 04:03:14.496
and prevents you from moving it further.

4945
04:03:14.496 --> 04:03:16.105
You can use your second attack
if you want to try again.

4946
04:03:16.105 --> 04:03:17.688
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MATT: All right.

4947
04:03:18.713 --> 04:03:19.630
ASHLEY: Reckless.

4948
04:03:20.572 --> 04:03:23.751
MATT: Oh, you do have advantage on your strength checks,

4949
04:03:23.751 --> 04:03:26.583
because you are-- oh no,
you're not raging, so you're not.

4950
04:03:26.583 --> 04:03:28.844
Never mind. So the second one is?

4951
04:03:28.844 --> 04:03:31.066
ASHLEY: Wait, but why did I just roll twice?

4952
04:03:31.066 --> 04:03:33.231
LAURA: Because she was reckless attacking you.

4953
04:03:33.231 --> 04:03:35.374
MATT: Well this is a strength check,
if you're just pushing her.

4954
04:03:35.374 --> 04:03:38.023
So for the first one was,

4955
04:03:38.023 --> 04:03:42.210
ASHLEY: I think the first one was a four, so, seven.

4956
04:03:42.210 --> 04:03:45.666
MATT: Seven, yeah, you're pushing her,
but she's digging in,

4957
04:03:45.666 --> 04:03:47.956
resisting, resisting and she's
scraping across the ground,

4958
04:03:47.956 --> 04:03:52.131
you're getting-- you see the dirt groove

4959
04:03:52.131 --> 04:03:54.940
push behind her as you're slowly

4960
04:03:54.940 --> 04:03:57.442
pushing her towards the bars.
You don't quite get her there,

4961
04:03:57.442 --> 04:04:00.500
but you're definitely getting
some ground with her.

4962
04:04:00.500 --> 04:04:02.990
On her attack, she's still
clutching onto your throat

4963
04:04:02.990 --> 04:04:05.740
and is going to continue to squeeze.

4964
04:04:07.108 --> 04:04:08.775
Misses the first one.

4965
04:04:10.658 --> 04:04:14.338
And yeah, she's going reckless with these, so.

4966
04:04:14.338 --> 04:04:15.208
That's going to hit.

4967
04:04:15.208 --> 04:04:17.819
That's another six points
of bludgeoning damage.

4968
04:04:17.819 --> 04:04:20.297
And 12 points total.

4969
04:04:20.297 --> 04:04:21.130
ASHLEY: 12 points total?

4970
04:04:21.130 --> 04:04:23.147
MATT: Yeah, still just squeezing.

4971
04:04:23.147 --> 04:04:25.515
The absolute anger in her eyes, but still a look

4972
04:04:25.515 --> 04:04:28.328
of confusion, the head's turned to the side.

4973
04:04:28.328 --> 04:04:29.647
Your turn.
ASHLEY: Okay.

4974
04:04:29.647 --> 04:04:31.247
I'm going to shove her back into the wall again,

4975
04:04:31.247 --> 04:04:34.414
see if I can do that.
MATT: Strength check.

4976
04:04:35.447 --> 04:04:37.346
ASHLEY: 14.
MATT: Natural one.

4977
04:04:37.346 --> 04:04:39.647
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'm going to
shove her up against the wall

4978
04:04:39.647 --> 04:04:40.806
and I'm going to scream at her,

4979
04:04:40.806 --> 04:04:44.297
show me why you're the fucking champion!

4980
04:04:44.297 --> 04:04:45.208
(laughter)

4981
04:04:45.208 --> 04:04:46.266
MATT: Oh, shit.

4982
04:04:46.266 --> 04:04:48.595
So as you, doosh, into the metal bars,

4983
04:04:48.595 --> 04:04:52.115
the guards and the healer back away

4984
04:04:52.115 --> 04:04:54.987
as dust shakes off of them.

4985
04:04:54.987 --> 04:04:57.266
The bars, the sound of the iron clattering

4986
04:04:57.266 --> 04:04:59.886
fills the chamber with this heavy impact sound.

4987
04:04:59.886 --> 04:05:01.947
Everybody on this end is leaning over the bars

4988
04:05:01.947 --> 04:05:03.606
to see where it's going.

4989
04:05:03.606 --> 04:05:07.226
You hear a table get pushed over off to the side

4990
04:05:07.226 --> 04:05:10.027
as someone got excited and knocked it over.

4991
04:05:10.027 --> 04:05:12.838
For her turn she's going to turn back and release,

4992
04:05:12.838 --> 04:05:16.190
or not, she's going to pull her
thumb away from your wind pipe

4993
04:05:16.190 --> 04:05:18.599
and is going to attempt to head butt you.

4994
04:05:20.697 --> 04:05:23.699
That is going to be reckless on you.

4995
04:05:23.699 --> 04:05:26.118
Yeah, that's six points of bludgeoning damage.

4996
04:05:26.118 --> 04:05:27.725
Crack, right into your forehead.

4997
04:05:27.725 --> 04:05:31.347
You can feel the skin split,
and the blood begin to warm

4998
04:05:31.347 --> 04:05:33.429
down the front of your face and nose.

4999
04:05:33.429 --> 04:05:36.821
Second head butt, it's going to be a...
LAURA: Oh, twice in a row.

5000
04:05:36.821 --> 04:05:38.091
20 to hit,

5001
04:05:38.091 --> 04:05:39.859
another six bludgeoning damage.

5002
04:05:39.859 --> 04:05:43.597
Crack, a second time, her head split as well.

5003
04:05:43.597 --> 04:05:45.367
There's just blood on both of your faces.

5004
04:05:45.367 --> 04:05:46.617
But she just--

5005
04:05:48.157 --> 04:05:49.706
Third one.

5006
04:05:49.706 --> 04:05:51.581
Is going to be a 15.

5007
04:05:52.774 --> 04:05:54.186
Does 15 hit?
ASHLEY: It doesn't hit.

5008
04:05:54.186 --> 04:05:55.842
MATT: The third time, she goes to
headbutt you a third time,

5009
04:05:55.842 --> 04:05:58.191
and it's just too slick and it actually

5010
04:05:58.191 --> 04:06:00.230
skids off to the side as you
move your head along the way.

5011
04:06:00.230 --> 04:06:01.160
It's your turn.

5012
04:06:01.160 --> 04:06:01.993
ASHLEY: Okay.

5013
04:06:07.336 --> 04:06:09.954
I'm going to try to shove her off of me.

5014
04:06:09.954 --> 04:06:11.346
MATT: Okay.

5015
04:06:11.346 --> 04:06:12.429
ASHLEY: Natural 20.

5016
04:06:14.256 --> 04:06:15.184
MATT: Okay.

5017
04:06:15.184 --> 04:06:18.245
ASHLEY: So I'd like to shove her off of me.

5018
04:06:18.245 --> 04:06:19.924
MATT: Yeah, (chuckles) natural one.

5019
04:06:19.924 --> 04:06:22.347
Two natural ones in a row on her.

5020
04:06:22.347 --> 04:06:26.288
ASHLEY: And just shove her off and
throw her against the wall.

5021
04:06:26.288 --> 04:06:27.633
MATT: Okay, so you push her this way

5022
04:06:27.633 --> 04:06:29.182
into the bars again on this end?

5023
04:06:29.182 --> 04:06:30.090
ASHLEY: Yeah.

5024
04:06:30.090 --> 04:06:31.650
MATT: So you pull back and shove her off.

5025
04:06:31.650 --> 04:06:33.331
She slams into the bars.

5026
04:06:33.331 --> 04:06:36.214
They rattle from the impact.

5027
04:06:38.001 --> 04:06:39.563
She's like-- (pants)

5028
04:06:39.563 --> 04:06:41.702
ASHLEY: (quietly) Come on, champion.

5029
04:06:41.702 --> 04:06:43.833
You're so close.

5030
04:06:43.833 --> 04:06:45.353
Fucking finish it.

5031
04:06:45.353 --> 04:06:48.334
TRAVIS: (laughs)

5032
04:06:48.334 --> 04:06:50.201
SAM: Jesus.

5033
04:06:50.201 --> 04:06:51.494
MARISHA: The fucking fuck?

5034
04:06:51.494 --> 04:06:52.551
SAM: This is the saddest pit fight.

5035
04:06:52.551 --> 04:06:54.445
MATT: Are you moving in to close the gap?

5036
04:06:54.445 --> 04:06:56.188
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MATT: All right.

5037
04:06:56.188 --> 04:06:58.625
LIAM: Ashley Johnson, you crazy motherfucker.

5038
04:06:58.625 --> 04:07:01.371
MATT: I know, what the fuck?

5039
04:07:01.371 --> 04:07:02.713
LAURA: Do you feel intimidated?

5040
04:07:02.713 --> 04:07:05.921
MATT: Yeah!
(laughter)

5041
04:07:05.921 --> 04:07:08.509
ASHLEY: My voice is not fully there,
so I like tried doing

5042
04:07:08.509 --> 04:07:10.416
the yelling and I'm like,
I'm just stick to whispering.

5043
04:07:10.416 --> 04:07:11.786
TRAVIS: No it's good, it's good.
MATT: It's cool, it's cool.

5044
04:07:11.786 --> 04:07:14.619
ASHLEY: It's not fully coming out.
LIAM: Where is Harvey Dent?

5045
04:07:14.619 --> 04:07:15.808
ASHLEY: Where is Harvey Dent?

5046
04:07:15.808 --> 04:07:16.755
MATT: So another--?
ASHLEY: 24.

5047
04:07:16.755 --> 04:07:18.172
MATT: All right.
ASHLEY: 24.

5048
04:07:19.263 --> 04:07:21.384
MATT: Another two damage, as you rush forward,

5049
04:07:21.384 --> 04:07:23.272
and what is this attack?

5050
04:07:23.272 --> 04:07:25.373
ASHLEY: I'm just going to push
her again into the bars.

5051
04:07:25.373 --> 04:07:27.464
MATT: Against the bars, she's
going to grab both the hands

5052
04:07:27.464 --> 04:07:28.899
as you push her into it

5053
04:07:28.899 --> 04:07:31.390
and knock them away and is going to go ahead

5054
04:07:31.390 --> 04:07:34.950
and attempt to punch upward
with an uppercut towards you.

5055
04:07:34.950 --> 04:07:37.450
Reckless, that's going to be a...

5056
04:07:38.782 --> 04:07:39.769
18?
ASHLEY: Yep.

5057
04:07:39.769 --> 04:07:41.683
MATT: Six points of bludgeoning damage.

5058
04:07:41.683 --> 04:07:42.992
ASHLEY: Great.

5059
04:07:42.992 --> 04:07:45.281
MATT: Yeah, another six points of bludgeoning damage.

5060
04:07:45.281 --> 04:07:46.131
ASHLEY: So close.

5061
04:07:46.131 --> 04:07:49.320
MATT: And then another six points of bludgeoning damage.

5062
04:07:49.320 --> 04:07:50.372
SAM: Oh, boy.

5063
04:07:50.372 --> 04:07:53.952
MATT: Just (mimics thuds) and then
hits you in the stomach,

5064
04:07:53.952 --> 04:07:55.280
extremely hard.

5065
04:07:55.280 --> 04:07:58.089
You weren't quite ready for
your muscles to contract in time

5066
04:07:58.089 --> 04:08:00.738
and you just take full impact
to the inside of your torso

5067
04:08:00.738 --> 04:08:03.570
and you feel like all the organs seize in pain

5068
04:08:03.570 --> 04:08:06.522
and the impact ripple inside.

5069
04:08:06.522 --> 04:08:08.917
Your vision's starting to go a little...

5070
04:08:08.917 --> 04:08:10.000
LIAM: It's great.

5071
04:08:11.689 --> 04:08:12.522
ASHLEY: Damn.

5072
04:08:13.518 --> 04:08:15.947
Oh, wait, why am I roll-- oh, reckless.

5073
04:08:15.947 --> 04:08:17.444
MATT: Well, she was reckless,
so you have advantage on her.

5074
04:08:17.444 --> 04:08:18.527
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah.

5075
04:08:20.815 --> 04:08:21.648
28.

5076
04:08:21.648 --> 04:08:23.292
MATT: All right, that hits, two damage.

5077
04:08:23.292 --> 04:08:25.709
ASHLEY: Okay, so I would like to...

5078
04:08:32.982 --> 04:08:34.041
Actually...

5079
04:08:39.220 --> 04:08:41.830
No, I don't want to do that.

5080
04:08:41.830 --> 04:08:44.360
I was thinking of something,
but I don't want to do that.

5081
04:08:46.110 --> 04:08:49.590
SAM: Finger of death.
ASHLEY: (chuckles) Yeah.

5082
04:08:49.590 --> 04:08:52.840
I'm just going to take the bottom of my

5083
04:08:54.678 --> 04:08:58.109
boot and I'm going to just
push her up against the wall.

5084
04:08:58.109 --> 04:09:01.367
MATT: She's like-- you just push her
and hold her against it.

5085
04:09:01.367 --> 04:09:03.316
Okay? (snarls)
TRAVIS: Like Sparta front kick?

5086
04:09:03.316 --> 04:09:06.692
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, just not really any damage.

5087
04:09:06.692 --> 04:09:09.052
MATT: You have your second attack?

5088
04:09:09.052 --> 04:09:10.207
ASHLEY: Yep.

5089
04:09:10.207 --> 04:09:12.624
LAURA: Crush her.
MATT: With advantage.

5090
04:09:14.656 --> 04:09:16.073
ASHLEY: 15?
MATT: 15 misses.

5091
04:09:17.334 --> 04:09:18.993
So no damage, but she's still holding the boot there.

5092
04:09:18.993 --> 04:09:23.157
Her turn, she's going to attempt to

5093
04:09:23.157 --> 04:09:25.837
punch right underneath where the knee joint is

5094
04:09:25.837 --> 04:09:28.063
to see if she can--
LAURA: Ooh, yeah, that's good.

5095
04:09:28.063 --> 04:09:29.438
SAM: Sweep the leg.

5096
04:09:29.438 --> 04:09:31.235
MATT: Six points of bludgeoning damage.

5097
04:09:31.235 --> 04:09:33.125
Knocks you underneath, the knee buckles

5098
04:09:33.125 --> 04:09:36.392
and she shoves your leg off
to the side, you catch yourself.

5099
04:09:36.392 --> 04:09:38.229
Second attack.
ASHLEY: I grab her.

5100
04:09:38.229 --> 04:09:41.229
And I just say, finish it, champion.

5101
04:09:42.389 --> 04:09:43.556
MATT: She looks...

5102
04:09:44.589 --> 04:09:47.289
So furious and so weirded out,

5103
04:09:48.859 --> 04:09:50.756
that she just doesn't know what to do.

5104
04:09:50.756 --> 04:09:54.506
And is like (grunts wildly).

5105
04:09:55.448 --> 04:09:58.486
And that is going to be a 15 to hit.

5106
04:09:58.486 --> 04:10:00.756
ASHLEY: It doesn't hit.
LAURA: (laughs)

5107
04:10:00.756 --> 04:10:05.683
MATT: That will hit, another six
points of bludgeoning damage.

5108
04:10:05.683 --> 04:10:08.425
ASHLEY: As she hits me, bloodied,

5109
04:10:09.531 --> 04:10:12.371
just a smile of relief

5110
04:10:12.371 --> 04:10:15.862
before being knocked unconscious.

5111
04:10:15.862 --> 04:10:18.029
MATT: And as the final blow...

5112
04:10:21.132 --> 04:10:22.632
Yasha swings back.

5113
04:10:23.472 --> 04:10:27.662
Her feet go into the air and on the ground.

5114
04:10:27.662 --> 04:10:30.043
The smile on her face.

5115
04:10:30.043 --> 04:10:32.902
So you don't even try the--
you're not raging, yeah.

5116
04:10:32.902 --> 04:10:35.043
And so you just, the eyes roll back

5117
04:10:35.043 --> 04:10:37.665
as the grin hits, that you all see.

5118
04:10:37.665 --> 04:10:39.606
And everyone goes like...

5119
04:10:39.606 --> 04:10:40.545
"Yeah!"

5120
04:10:40.545 --> 04:10:41.823
And they cheer.

5121
04:10:41.823 --> 04:10:44.588
"Kal, Kal, Kal, Kal, Kal!"

5122
04:10:44.588 --> 04:10:45.588
And Kal's...

5123
04:10:46.787 --> 04:10:49.267
But all the cheers die away a bit,

5124
04:10:49.267 --> 04:10:51.555
because Kal is not celebrating.

5125
04:10:51.555 --> 04:10:53.739
Kal is just like she had seen a ghost

5126
04:10:53.739 --> 04:10:55.807
is just staring at Yasha
unconscious on the ground,

5127
04:10:55.807 --> 04:10:58.869
the blood caked under her finger nails,

5128
04:10:58.869 --> 04:11:00.999
the little bit of blood dripping from her jaw

5129
04:11:00.999 --> 04:11:04.749
just like... (pants)

5130
04:11:10.570 --> 04:11:13.378
And just leaves, like leaves the entire arena.

5131
04:11:13.378 --> 04:11:14.997
Storms through the gates, up the stairs,

5132
04:11:14.997 --> 04:11:16.477
and out of the venue.

5133
04:11:16.477 --> 04:11:18.114
ASHLEY: I ruin people.

5134
04:11:18.114 --> 04:11:20.093
(laughter)

5135
04:11:20.093 --> 04:11:21.893
SAM: She's going to give up fighting.

5136
04:11:21.893 --> 04:11:22.726
TALIESIN: Wow.

5137
04:11:26.273 --> 04:11:28.273
MATT: Everything gets quiet.

5138
04:11:29.723 --> 04:11:34.174
(as Jacquel) "Okay, that's been
a real interesting evening!

5139
04:11:34.174 --> 04:11:36.257
"Thank you all for coming.

5140
04:11:37.374 --> 04:11:40.593
"Let's go ahead and do some
payouts here and thank you

5141
04:11:40.593 --> 04:11:43.689
"for making time here in
the middle of the week, uh...

5142
04:11:44.981 --> 04:11:46.041
"Yeah!"

5143
04:11:46.041 --> 04:11:50.553
(laughter)
(applause)

5144
04:11:50.553 --> 04:11:52.749
TRAVIS: I jog over to the open bars,

5145
04:11:52.749 --> 04:11:55.099
since I'm down there anyway, and just like--

5146
04:11:55.099 --> 04:11:56.432
MARISHA: I go with Fjord.

5147
04:11:57.708 --> 04:11:59.107
TRAVIS: Medic!

5148
04:11:59.107 --> 04:12:03.190
MATT: The medic's already rushed over and you heal...

5149
04:12:04.389 --> 04:12:07.268
ASHLEY: I think, um, what is the thing--

5150
04:12:07.268 --> 04:12:08.526
oh, no, that's only if you're raging.

5151
04:12:08.526 --> 04:12:10.648
MATT: 14 hit points you heal.

5152
04:12:10.648 --> 04:12:12.747
MARISHA: I just look at Fjord.

5153
04:12:12.747 --> 04:12:14.187
ASHLEY: 14 hit points, okay.

5154
04:12:14.187 --> 04:12:17.047
TRAVIS: We agreed to have our asses kicked.

5155
04:12:17.047 --> 04:12:19.495
SAM: (laughs)

5156
04:12:19.495 --> 04:12:21.024
TRAVIS: A show of solidarity.

5157
04:12:21.024 --> 04:12:24.377
MARISHA: That was the conversation
when you all were alone?

5158
04:12:24.377 --> 04:12:26.544
TRAVIS: Don't try to understand.

5159
04:12:27.548 --> 04:12:28.706
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

5160
04:12:28.706 --> 04:12:31.106
MATT: Are you intentionally trying to deceive her?

5161
04:12:31.106 --> 04:12:32.304
TRAVIS: No, I'm just lying.

5162
04:12:32.304 --> 04:12:34.687
(laughter)

5163
04:12:34.687 --> 04:12:35.939
MARISHA: Beau knows. (laughs)

5164
04:12:35.939 --> 04:12:37.957
LAURA: Beau knows.
TRAVIS: Beau knows.

5165
04:12:37.957 --> 04:12:40.628
LAURA: I look over at Caduceus.

5166
04:12:40.628 --> 04:12:43.191
ASHLEY: She was a champion, for sure.

5167
04:12:43.191 --> 04:12:44.271
LAURA: I think, um--

5168
04:12:44.271 --> 04:12:45.629
TALIESIN: We're going to have to have a talk about that.

5169
04:12:45.629 --> 04:12:47.480
LAURA: I think Yasha needs some--

5170
04:12:47.480 --> 04:12:49.682
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're going to talk about that.

5171
04:12:49.682 --> 04:12:52.983
MARISHA: Yasha comes out of our gate, yeah?

5172
04:12:52.983 --> 04:12:54.473
MATT: Yeah, Yasha does comes out,

5173
04:12:54.473 --> 04:12:56.063
and joins you guys in the foyer area.

5174
04:12:56.063 --> 04:12:57.852
Other folks are starting to gather.

5175
04:12:57.852 --> 04:13:01.143
TRAVIS: How're you feelin'?
MARISHA: Hi, friend!

5176
04:13:01.143 --> 04:13:03.797
ASHLEY: She was very, very strong.

5177
04:13:03.797 --> 04:13:06.548
She is the champion for a reason.

5178
04:13:06.548 --> 04:13:09.785
TRAVIS: Yeah, kind of.
MARISHA: Uh huh, yup.

5179
04:13:09.785 --> 04:13:11.534
LAURA: It looked like it, it looked--

5180
04:13:11.534 --> 04:13:14.209
ASHLEY: I think I gave it my best.

5181
04:13:15.222 --> 04:13:16.675
MARISHA: Mm-hm.

5182
04:13:16.675 --> 04:13:20.034
TRAVIS: You certainly <i>slapped</i> her your best.

5183
04:13:22.675 --> 04:13:23.596
Are you okay?

5184
04:13:23.596 --> 04:13:25.067
MARISHA: Felt like a lot of whispering,

5185
04:13:25.067 --> 04:13:27.188
Was just all like a lot of like...

5186
04:13:27.188 --> 04:13:30.300
ASHLEY: Yeah, I think I was just off, I don't know,

5187
04:13:30.300 --> 04:13:31.798
because it just wasn't my fight.

5188
04:13:31.798 --> 04:13:32.769
TRAVIS: Okay.
ASHLEY: I'm sorry.

5189
04:13:32.769 --> 04:13:34.380
I can pay you guys back.

5190
04:13:34.380 --> 04:13:36.724
ALL: No, no!

5191
04:13:36.724 --> 04:13:39.119
LAURA: I know you tried your hardest, it's not--

5192
04:13:39.119 --> 04:13:40.202
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm sorry.

5193
04:13:40.202 --> 04:13:43.119
TRAVIS: Do you feel good about the fight?

5194
04:13:44.240 --> 04:13:45.919
ASHLEY: I feel great.

5195
04:13:45.919 --> 04:13:48.166
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, see that's apparent, actually.

5196
04:13:48.166 --> 04:13:50.278
That's kind of what concerns me.

5197
04:13:50.278 --> 04:13:54.774
TRAVIS: Yeah, you had this sort of a
grin when you went out.

5198
04:13:54.774 --> 04:13:56.714
I mean, I did as well.

5199
04:13:56.714 --> 04:14:00.246
I enjoy the feeling of being knocked unconscious,

5200
04:14:00.246 --> 04:14:04.782
but it seemed like you really, <i>really</i> liked it.

5201
04:14:04.782 --> 04:14:06.115
TALIESIN: Did you, uh...

5202
04:14:08.231 --> 04:14:11.481
Did you figure out what you were trying
to figure out in there?

5203
04:14:15.572 --> 04:14:17.989
ASHLEY: I don't think I did, but...

5204
04:14:19.433 --> 04:14:20.600
There was a...

5205
04:14:23.313 --> 04:14:25.730
A moment of release, I guess.

5206
04:14:28.100 --> 04:14:30.644
I'm going to get another mai tai.

5207
04:14:30.644 --> 04:14:32.364
(laughter)

5208
04:14:32.364 --> 04:14:36.608
MARISHA: Let's actually, let's go to, um--

5209
04:14:36.608 --> 04:14:41.077
let's go to our bar and get
like a round of mai tais, yeah?

5210
04:14:41.077 --> 04:14:42.376
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah.

5211
04:14:42.376 --> 04:14:43.237
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5212
04:14:43.237 --> 04:14:44.589
MATT: Official drink of Rexxentrum.

5213
04:14:44.589 --> 04:14:47.789
(laughter)

5214
04:14:47.789 --> 04:14:50.514
MARISHA: Land-locked Rexxentrum.

5215
04:14:51.857 --> 04:14:53.087
Mai tai.

5216
04:14:53.087 --> 04:14:55.687
LIAM: Yeah, before Yasha even
makes it eight or nine steps

5217
04:14:55.687 --> 04:14:58.905
from where she is, Caleb's
already got two large flagons

5218
04:14:58.905 --> 04:15:00.343
from the bar.

5219
04:15:00.343 --> 04:15:01.663
SAM: With huge umbrellas?

5220
04:15:01.663 --> 04:15:05.105
LIAM: Just hands one over--
huge umbrella, just hands it to her.

5221
04:15:05.105 --> 04:15:07.088
Holds her gaze for a second and says,

5222
04:15:08.047 --> 04:15:09.080
I get it.

5223
04:15:15.742 --> 04:15:18.723
MARISHA: That's still only two mai tais, though.

5224
04:15:18.723 --> 04:15:20.592
Like, I want a round of mai tais.

5225
04:15:20.592 --> 04:15:23.357
TRAVIS: Yeah, we need the spring break mai tais.

5226
04:15:23.357 --> 04:15:25.516
MATT: Gathering your winnings.
LAURA: Yeah.

5227
04:15:25.516 --> 04:15:27.203
SAM: Winnings?
MATT: Yes.

5228
04:15:27.203 --> 04:15:29.415
MATT: Caleb, you put in 300.

5229
04:15:29.415 --> 04:15:32.082
LIAM: 200 on this winner right here.

5230
04:15:32.975 --> 04:15:33.808
MATT: Right.

5231
04:15:34.794 --> 04:15:36.343
LIAM: Crone beater.

5232
04:15:36.343 --> 04:15:38.084
MATT: Right, 100 of yours and 100 of hers, right?

5233
04:15:38.084 --> 04:15:39.602
LIAM: Yes, 200 total.

5234
04:15:39.602 --> 04:15:43.435
MATT: Correct, so that would mean you would get...

5235
04:15:44.854 --> 04:15:47.854
LIAM: I just split whatever I get back with Beauregard.

5236
04:15:47.854 --> 04:15:51.593
MATT: Okay, so you get your 100 back, so 200 back,

5237
04:15:51.593 --> 04:15:56.473
plus, it would be an additional
400 you get on top of that.

5238
04:15:56.473 --> 04:15:59.369
LIAM: 400, okay, so I split,
so that's 600 total?

5239
04:15:59.369 --> 04:16:00.369
You get 300.

5240
04:16:01.630 --> 04:16:03.826
MARISHA: Thank you.
LIAM: I have 300.

5241
04:16:03.826 --> 04:16:05.484
MATT: Oh, sorry, you got 400 total on that,

5242
04:16:05.484 --> 04:16:07.774
so it was 200 each of you.
LIAM: Total, okay.

5243
04:16:07.774 --> 04:16:11.852
MATT: Beauregard, because you were the actual entry,

5244
04:16:11.852 --> 04:16:14.871
you win a 150 gold, plus 10% of the pot,

5245
04:16:14.871 --> 04:16:16.546
which would be...

5246
04:16:20.832 --> 04:16:21.665
260.

5247
04:16:22.584 --> 04:16:23.417
LAURA: Nice.

5248
04:16:24.744 --> 04:16:29.482
MATT: So it's a total of 310 that
you've made on top of that.

5249
04:16:29.482 --> 04:16:30.641
MARISHA: 310 gold.

5250
04:16:32.543 --> 04:16:34.103
Total, with Caleb?

5251
04:16:34.103 --> 04:16:36.020
MATT: No, this is just you.

5252
04:16:38.017 --> 04:16:39.987
LAURA: Yeah, you made bank tonight.

5253
04:16:39.987 --> 04:16:40.820
ASHLEY: Damn.

5254
04:16:41.787 --> 04:16:44.916
LIAM: You should wail on old dudes more often.

5255
04:16:44.916 --> 04:16:46.046
MARISHA: Holy shit.

5256
04:16:46.046 --> 04:16:48.629
SAM: The lesson is, punch old men.

5257
04:16:51.445 --> 04:16:54.045
MARISHA: I go up to Ova

5258
04:16:55.995 --> 04:16:57.287
with 100 gold.

5259
04:17:01.315 --> 04:17:04.514
Here, go to a dentist.

5260
04:17:04.514 --> 04:17:07.375
SAM: (laughs)

5261
04:17:07.375 --> 04:17:08.495
MATT: "Thank you."

5262
04:17:08.495 --> 04:17:09.328
MARISHA: Yeah.

5263
04:17:10.511 --> 04:17:12.003
LIAM: (lisping) Thank you.

5264
04:17:14.215 --> 04:17:19.048
MATT: And he gets a payout on
the side, too, from somebody else.

5265
04:17:19.933 --> 04:17:21.125
TRAVIS: He makes money every night.

5266
04:17:21.125 --> 04:17:21.958
MARISHA: Cool.

5267
04:17:23.058 --> 04:17:25.360
MATT: You get the sense.
MARISHA: Yeah, he's doing well.

5268
04:17:25.360 --> 04:17:26.413
Yeah.

5269
04:17:26.413 --> 04:17:27.824
TRAVIS: Plasma donation.

5270
04:17:27.824 --> 04:17:30.132
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: Hey man, my dad did it for a long time.

5271
04:17:30.132 --> 04:17:32.515
MARISHA: I feel a little less bad for him.

5272
04:17:32.515 --> 04:17:34.189
Bye, man, I'm just going to go.

5273
04:17:34.189 --> 04:17:35.022
MATT: Okay.

5274
04:17:36.208 --> 04:17:39.371
For Jester, you put 120 on Beau,

5275
04:17:39.371 --> 04:17:43.112
So you get the 120 back, plus the, uh,

5276
04:17:43.112 --> 04:17:46.067
what was the extra amount I told you it was the--

5277
04:17:47.267 --> 04:17:48.484
LIAM: What what?

5278
04:17:48.484 --> 04:17:50.315
TALIESIN: Double your--
LIAM: One plus two plus two plus one.

5279
04:17:50.315 --> 04:17:52.633
MATT: Right, it was the double down, so you got 240.

5280
04:17:52.633 --> 04:17:54.703
LAURA: 240 back.

5281
04:17:54.703 --> 04:17:56.516
MATT: Correct, you spent--

5282
04:17:56.516 --> 04:17:58.006
LAURA: That doesn't--

5283
04:17:58.006 --> 04:17:59.839
MATT: You spent 300 and...

5284
04:18:01.524 --> 04:18:02.604
LAURA: 320.

5285
04:18:02.604 --> 04:18:06.446
MATT: 320 and you got 240 back.

5286
04:18:07.298 --> 04:18:09.590
LAURA: Oh, okay, so I just, oh, okay.

5287
04:18:09.590 --> 04:18:10.423
MATT: You still lost money.

5288
04:18:10.423 --> 04:18:13.256
LAURA: It was a one to one thing, okay.

5289
04:18:14.301 --> 04:18:15.884
TALIESIN: Same, 200 back.

5290
04:18:17.636 --> 04:18:19.037
Fair.

5291
04:18:19.037 --> 04:18:21.807
MATT: So that is all the winnings distributed.

5292
04:18:21.807 --> 04:18:23.076
I'll double check when I have time

5293
04:18:23.076 --> 04:18:24.575
over the break, if need be.

5294
04:18:24.575 --> 04:18:25.674
SAM: Woo!

5295
04:18:25.674 --> 04:18:28.186
MATT: What have you been doing, Nott?

5296
04:18:28.186 --> 04:18:30.442
SAM: Robbin' the hat store!

5297
04:18:30.442 --> 04:18:31.902
(laughter)

5298
04:18:31.902 --> 04:18:33.382
LAURA: What?

5299
04:18:33.382 --> 04:18:34.364
What!

5300
04:18:34.364 --> 04:18:36.282
ASHLEY: Cy's Tops, or what's it called?

5301
04:18:36.282 --> 04:18:38.570
TRAVIS: Cy's Topper.
MATT: Cy's Topper.

5302
04:18:38.570 --> 04:18:41.630
Okay, go ahead and roll a--

5303
04:18:41.630 --> 04:18:43.000
LAURA: Oh, my god.

5304
04:18:43.000 --> 04:18:45.219
(laughter)

5305
04:18:45.219 --> 04:18:48.719
MATT: Go ahead and roll a thieves' tools check.

5306
04:18:49.649 --> 04:18:51.399
Using your dexterity.

5307
04:18:52.720 --> 04:18:55.053
SAM: I get reliable talent, 23.

5308
04:18:56.190 --> 04:18:58.410
MATT: 23, yeah.

5309
04:18:58.410 --> 04:19:01.038
You poke into that hat store.

5310
04:19:01.038 --> 04:19:02.742
It is closed.

5311
04:19:02.742 --> 04:19:07.159
It is a beautiful array of all sorts of strange hats.

5312
04:19:08.018 --> 04:19:09.941
Not like the highest end,

5313
04:19:09.941 --> 04:19:12.880
but it is a good array and you have the pick of the litter.

5314
04:19:12.880 --> 04:19:14.679
SAM: I want a top hat for myself.

5315
04:19:14.679 --> 04:19:15.826
MATT: You got it.

5316
04:19:15.826 --> 04:19:18.268
SAM: What else they got, they got any of those

5317
04:19:18.268 --> 04:19:20.800
weird Bavarian things?

5318
04:19:20.800 --> 04:19:23.659
MATT: No, no, they do have, um...

5319
04:19:23.659 --> 04:19:24.576
MARISHA: Tricorns?

5320
04:19:25.618 --> 04:19:27.639
SAM: You know, the little feather thing, yeah.

5321
04:19:27.639 --> 04:19:29.167
MATT: Well, I mean, there'd be something like that.

5322
04:19:29.167 --> 04:19:31.287
Akin to, I guess you could say.

5323
04:19:31.287 --> 04:19:34.704
There are plenty of detailed bonnets with

5324
04:19:35.927 --> 04:19:40.927
all sorts of faux flowers and veil elements of it.

5325
04:19:41.356 --> 04:19:45.356
There are wide-brimmed riding hats, there are...

5326
04:19:46.345 --> 04:19:48.114
SAM: I'll get a hat for everybody.

5327
04:19:48.114 --> 04:19:49.197
MATT: Okay, okay.

5328
04:19:50.152 --> 04:19:51.807
And you get to decide which hats you got.

5329
04:19:51.807 --> 04:19:53.586
TRAVIS: How much are you drinking right now?

5330
04:19:53.586 --> 04:19:56.375
SAM: Oh, plenty, I'm just walking down the aisles

5331
04:19:56.375 --> 04:19:58.047
drinkin', tryin' on hats.

5332
04:19:58.047 --> 04:20:00.836
MATT: Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy is going on.

5333
04:20:00.836 --> 04:20:02.808
SAM: Find a little mirror.

5334
04:20:02.808 --> 04:20:05.932
TRAVIS: (humming Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy)

5335
04:20:05.932 --> 04:20:07.349
MATT: That's amazing.

5336
04:20:09.222 --> 04:20:12.970
SAM: Get a little yarmulke for Beau. (chuckles)

5337
04:20:12.970 --> 04:20:14.053
I don't know.

5338
04:20:15.690 --> 04:20:17.009
MATT: All right.
MARISHA: I'll take it.

5339
04:20:17.009 --> 04:20:19.849
MATT: As you guys wander outside the butchery,

5340
04:20:19.849 --> 04:20:23.078
and catch up with Nott, who is clutching a pile of hats.

5341
04:20:23.078 --> 04:20:24.056
TRAVIS: The fuck?

5342
04:20:24.056 --> 04:20:25.514
SAM: I got presents!

5343
04:20:25.514 --> 04:20:28.404
LAURA: Where did you get this?
LIAM: Did you buy those?

5344
04:20:28.404 --> 04:20:29.714
All those hats?

5345
04:20:29.714 --> 04:20:30.754
SAM: Yes!

5346
04:20:30.754 --> 04:20:33.802
(laughter)

5347
04:20:33.802 --> 04:20:35.577
TALIESIN: Sure.
LIAM: It's so late.

5348
04:20:35.577 --> 04:20:37.832
Where did you find a place
that was open selling hats?

5349
04:20:37.832 --> 04:20:40.582
SAM: There's a all-night haberdasher.

5350
04:20:41.815 --> 04:20:43.036
LAURA: What'd you get for me?

5351
04:20:43.036 --> 04:20:46.896
SAM: I got you, um, well, your horns are an issue.

5352
04:20:46.896 --> 04:20:47.729
LAURA: Yeah.

5353
04:20:47.729 --> 04:20:49.488
It's got to be a little teeny hat if you're going to--

5354
04:20:49.488 --> 04:20:53.477
SAM: Yeah, I got you just one of
those tiny little doll hats

5355
04:20:53.477 --> 04:20:56.737
that you put on with a little strap.

5356
04:20:56.737 --> 04:20:59.070
LAURA: That's so cute, I love it.

5357
04:21:00.348 --> 04:21:02.015
LIAM: Thanks, I hate it.

5358
04:21:02.965 --> 04:21:04.465
SAM: I got you a fez.

5359
04:21:05.951 --> 04:21:10.550
TALIESIN: It's weird with this head
to get this sitting right.

5360
04:21:10.550 --> 04:21:13.316
MARISHA: It kind of suits you in a weird way.
TALIESIN: Really?

5361
04:21:13.316 --> 04:21:15.062
TRAVIS: Inspector Gadget.
MARISHA: It goes with your very--

5362
04:21:15.062 --> 04:21:17.366
Yeah, you have a very vertical aesthetic.

5363
04:21:17.366 --> 04:21:18.823
TALIESIN: It doesn't nothing to keep the sun off.

5364
04:21:18.823 --> 04:21:20.353
I don't really see the point.

5365
04:21:20.353 --> 04:21:22.582
SAM: Yasha, I got you a yellow beanie.

5366
04:21:22.582 --> 04:21:23.816
ASHLEY: Oh, cool.

5367
04:21:24.753 --> 04:21:25.586
I like it.

5368
04:21:26.484 --> 04:21:27.392
It fits.

5369
04:21:27.392 --> 04:21:29.221
TALIESIN: If you flip it down, it'll be more your style.

5370
04:21:29.221 --> 04:21:30.742
ASHLEY: If I flip it down, it'll be sad.

5371
04:21:30.742 --> 04:21:32.526
TRAVIS: Oh, shit!

5372
04:21:33.954 --> 04:21:36.067
SAM: I got you this weird Bavarian hat.

5373
04:21:36.067 --> 04:21:37.878
(laughter)

5374
04:21:37.878 --> 04:21:39.498
Oh!

5375
04:21:39.498 --> 04:21:41.358
LAURA: Ooh, it's really long.

5376
04:21:41.358 --> 04:21:43.528
LIAM: I feel like a bird.

5377
04:21:43.528 --> 04:21:46.139
SAM: I got a nice top hat for me, but it's like

5378
04:21:46.139 --> 04:21:50.288
one of those big ones, like a Mad Hatter hat.

5379
04:21:50.288 --> 04:21:52.871
(laughter)

5380
04:21:53.808 --> 04:21:56.548
I got you a baseball cap,

5381
04:21:56.548 --> 04:21:58.715
or the Zemnian equivalent.

5382
04:21:59.877 --> 04:22:00.917
TRAVIS: Yeah, uh-huh.

5383
04:22:00.917 --> 04:22:02.629
ASHLEY: I went to Rexxentrum and all I got was this--

5384
04:22:02.629 --> 04:22:04.577
MARISHA: Lousy hat, yeah.

5385
04:22:04.577 --> 04:22:06.244
LIAM: Hello, little boy.

5386
04:22:09.749 --> 04:22:11.832
SAM: And Fjord, I got you...

5387
04:22:14.320 --> 04:22:18.384
Just like a cleric's...

5388
04:22:18.384 --> 04:22:22.574
Not a cleric's, a clerk's visor for doing accounting.

5389
04:22:22.574 --> 04:22:23.491
TRAVIS: Oh, good.

5390
04:22:24.950 --> 04:22:27.546
LAURA: I would've thought like a cowboy hat.

5391
04:22:27.546 --> 04:22:29.465
LIAM: Or a pirate's hat, or--

5392
04:22:29.465 --> 04:22:32.214
SAM: Hold on, I'm going to go back in
and find a cowboy hat.

5393
04:22:32.214 --> 04:22:33.934
(laughter)

5394
04:22:33.934 --> 04:22:35.838
TRAVIS: Did she just run in next door?

5395
04:22:35.838 --> 04:22:37.268
MATT: Roll an investigation check.
TRAVIS: Oh, god.

5396
04:22:37.268 --> 04:22:39.966
Is anyone out in the street?

5397
04:22:39.966 --> 04:22:40.799
SAM: 19.

5398
04:22:42.005 --> 04:22:44.301
MATT: You recall seeing-- it's not a cowboy hat, it is

5399
04:22:44.301 --> 04:22:46.473
a rider's hat, but it looks strangely like a cowboy hat.

5400
04:22:46.473 --> 04:22:47.483
You do find one.

5401
04:22:47.483 --> 04:22:49.483

5402
04:22:49.483 --> 04:22:52.193

MARISHA: Mai tais, woo!

5406
04:22:59.549 --> 04:23:03.532
MATT: With hats adorned, drinks on the way,

5407
04:23:03.532 --> 04:23:06.930
you stumble out, some of you sore

5408
04:23:06.930 --> 04:23:10.490
physically, some of you sore emotionally,

5409
04:23:10.490 --> 04:23:13.407
towards an evening of hat drinking.

5410
04:23:14.548 --> 04:23:17.877
And that's where we'll end this holiday episode. (laughs)

5411
04:23:17.877 --> 04:23:19.974

5415
04:23:30.389 --> 04:23:32.339
MATT: Man, that was a strange second half.

5416
04:23:32.339 --> 04:23:34.078
(laughter)

5417
04:23:34.078 --> 04:23:35.617
TRAVIS: That was really cool.

5418
04:23:35.617 --> 04:23:36.939
MATT: No, it was great!

5419
04:23:36.939 --> 04:23:39.511

TRAVIS: The moment it started--

5420
04:23:39.511 --> 04:23:41.930
MARISHA: Holy shit, Yasha!
MATT: That was fucking cool, Yasha.

5421
04:23:41.930 --> 04:23:43.815

MATT: Oh, yeah!

5428
04:23:58.641 --> 04:24:01.368
Yeah, I dig it, I dig it.

5429
04:24:01.368 --> 04:24:03.897
LIAM: Is the Stormlord just Johnny Cash?

5430
04:24:03.897 --> 04:24:04.730

5431
04:24:07.709 --> 04:24:10.780

04:24:12.300 --> 04:24:15.081
MATT: Pick up from here, a whole lot of threads,

5434
04:24:15.081 --> 04:24:19.246
some reading to do, some weaving to do,

5435
04:24:19.246 --> 04:24:23.689
all sorts of insanity and a looming prospect

5436
04:24:23.689 --> 04:24:27.380
of trying to sew this negotiation together

5437
04:24:27.380 --> 04:24:29.713
between two warring nations.

5438
04:24:30.657 --> 04:24:32.148
So we got a lot to look forward to.

5439
04:24:32.148 --> 04:24:33.225
SAM: 2020!

5440
04:24:33.225 --> 04:24:35.294

5449
04:24:53.319 --> 04:24:55.540

5450
04:24:55.540 --> 04:24:57.561
but know that we're there with you.

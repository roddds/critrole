00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.958
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:03.958 --> 00:00:08.059
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Before we jump in tonight, we

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:13.120
have a few announcements we want to get through.
First up, we have a birthday today, we have my

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.902
wonderful wife, Marisha. It's her birthday today!
Happy birthday!

00:00:16.902 --> 00:00:19.761
(cheering)

00:00:19.761 --> 00:00:25.057
MARISHA: Thank you, thank you. Thank you to my
mother who birthed me. She should really be the

00:00:25.057 --> 00:00:26.617
one who's getting thanked.

00:00:26.617 --> 00:00:27.428
LAURA: Yes, she really should.

00:00:27.428 --> 00:00:28.118
MARISHA: Yes.

00:00:28.118 --> 00:00:29.173
LIAM: Still alive, mom.

00:00:29.173 --> 00:00:30.691
SAM: Reenact it for us.

00:00:33.751 --> 00:00:36.250
MARISHA: I'll leave that to Laura in a couple
months.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.346
MATT: Happy birthday.

00:00:39.346 --> 00:00:39.873
MARISHA: Thanks.

00:00:42.753 --> 00:00:45.672
MATT: Next up, we have our two sponsors this
evening. First--

00:00:45.672 --> 00:00:46.272
SAM: Two?

00:00:46.272 --> 00:00:47.714
MATT: Yes, two!

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:50.341
SAM: I only prepared one. What's happening?

00:00:50.341 --> 00:00:53.201
MATT: I'm doing the second one. You're fine. But
our first sponsor for the evening is our returning

00:00:53.201 --> 00:00:56.298
friends at D&amp;D Beyond. Sam?

00:00:56.298 --> 00:01:03.482
SAM: D&amp;D Beyond, everybody. (clears throat) D&amp;D
Beyond is our fabulous sponsor, they're here every

00:01:03.482 --> 00:01:11.890
week. They put these things on our iPads-- I mean,
our tablet devices that help us track our stats

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:18.079
and stuff, and they wanted us to let you know that
this week, Matt Mercer's gunslinger fighter

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:24.014
subclass is now available on D&amp;D Beyond. In the
character builder, critters can begin creating

00:01:24.014 --> 00:01:32.808
their version of Percy right now on D&amp;D Beyond.
They actually already have started creating their

00:01:32.808 --> 00:01:39.517
own versions of Percy and loading it with the
features that we've come love about Percy. I've

00:01:39.517 --> 00:01:47.260
compiled a list. It's the Top Ten List of Percy
Features Being Added on D&amp;D! Everyone, a little,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:54.720
light drumroll if you could. Number ten: extra
long, pompous names. Number nine: skin so white it

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:04.142
claps on the ones and threes. Number eight: bags
containing gunpowder and Victor fingers. Number

00:02:04.142 --> 00:02:08.991
seven: that feat where your dice always roll 20s
even though they're not cursed by a demonic

00:02:08.991 --> 00:02:19.379
ritual. Number six: blue hair dye! Number five:
steampunk bifocals. Number four: giant bathtubs

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:26.445
that comfortably hold a female half-elf under the
water for 15 minutes. You can add these features

00:02:26.445 --> 00:02:30.045
to your Percy. Number three: throat bubbles.

00:02:30.045 --> 00:02:34.642
(laughter)

00:02:34.642 --> 00:02:35.080
TALIESIN: Wow.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.530
(laughter continues)

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.484
SAM: Number two: wit and tact.

00:02:45.224 --> 00:02:46.453
LIAM: Wait, what what what?

00:02:46.453 --> 00:02:52.302
SAM: Wit and tact. And the number one thing being
added to the gunslinger class: knives.

00:02:54.472 --> 00:03:00.989
MATT: Thank you, Sam. You guys can use the
gunslinger fighter archetype as well as the new

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:06.325
feat that goes along with it; that's on there as
well. Which anyone can take to learn firearms, be

00:03:06.325 --> 00:03:09.126
better at firearms, even if you're not a
gunslinger, so check that out on the app. Thank

00:03:09.126 --> 00:03:14.254
you guys at D&amp;D Beyond for being awesome, and you
for supporting them and us. Of course, our second

00:03:14.254 --> 00:03:18.177
sponsor for tonight, returning, our fun friends at
Obsidian with Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire,

00:03:18.177 --> 00:03:19.080
which is finally out!

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.453
LIAM: I know, it's so exciting. It's so good, it's
so pretty, it sounds so good, it plays so good.

00:03:22.453 --> 00:03:23.784
MATT: It's really good.

00:03:26.234 --> 00:03:27.727
SAM: I got it working.

00:03:27.727 --> 00:03:30.257
(laughter)

00:03:30.262 --> 00:03:32.014
MATT: That was the best response.

00:03:32.014 --> 00:03:33.738
SAM: I can move my guy now.

00:03:33.738 --> 00:03:38.951
MATT: I was there when he got that text, we just
went (sputtering laughing). Oh my god.

00:03:38.951 --> 00:03:40.668
SAM: I looked it up on Google first.

00:03:42.218 --> 00:03:48.485
MATT: See, and he's already a step above most
people on the internet. Deadfire's out, super

00:03:48.485 --> 00:03:55.017
excited, the voice sets and portraits of Vox
Machina are in the game for free DLC, on PC. It'll

00:03:55.017 --> 00:04:01.733
be out for console later this year. If MetaCritic
doesn't lie, it's at 90 and climbing. I love it.

00:04:01.733 --> 00:04:06.077
I'm so excited, I'm so glad people enjoy it, and
so glad we can be a part of it.

00:04:06.077 --> 00:04:11.873
LIAM: I played today and I just got my first dose
of kaiju-god Taliesin, not regular-god Taliesin,

00:04:11.873 --> 00:04:14.602
kaiju-god Taliesin. It's good.

00:04:15.252 --> 00:04:16.695
TALIESIN: I haven't gotten there yet.

00:04:17.505 --> 00:04:20.874
MATT: Laura's character and Marisha's character in
my party are starting to flirt and I'm like

00:04:20.874 --> 00:04:30.083
(nervous sound). I don't know how I feel about
that. Of course, I made Gilmore. Marisha's

00:04:30.083 --> 00:04:34.273
character was flirting with me at first and I was
like, "Nah, I got to shut this down, Gilmore's not interested."

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:35.999
MARISHA: (laughter) That's fair.

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:37.852
MATT: At least you two are getting together.

00:04:37.852 --> 00:04:39.177
MARISHA: Just waiting for the other guys.

00:04:40.727 --> 00:04:48.688
MATT: I get enough of this in real life. Happy
birthday. Also, we are heading back to GenCon,

00:04:48.688 --> 00:04:57.372
guys! Our tickets went on sale earlier this week
for the live show in Indianapolis, you can find it

00:04:57.372 --> 00:05:05.543
on Ticketmaster. The official GenCon panel is sold
out, but keep an eye on the GenCon website as

00:05:05.543 --> 00:05:09.956
tickets that are relinquished may become available
as it goes on. They keep cycling through and as

00:05:09.956 --> 00:05:12.983
things become available, they'll update it, so
keep an eye. We'll try and update you as soon as

00:05:12.983 --> 00:05:15.529
we hear anything beyond that. But holy shit.

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:19.782
TRAVIS: If there are balcony seats for the live
show, do not be afraid of them, because that

00:05:19.782 --> 00:05:26.298
balcony crew is raucous. Just being in that room
while the live madness is going on is something to

00:05:26.298 --> 00:05:30.118
behold, so even if it's the back, if you want to
go, go.

00:05:30.118 --> 00:05:33.053
LAURA: It was a really fun group in the audience
last time.

00:05:33.053 --> 00:05:34.710
SAM: I'm going to hide some stuff up there.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.562
LAURA: I like that.

00:05:36.562 --> 00:05:38.160
SAM: We'll hide some stuff.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.307
MATT: Why does it smell so funky back here?

00:05:42.757 --> 00:05:45.062
TRAVIS: Why is there silly string coming out of
the balcony?

00:05:45.062 --> 00:05:52.415
MATT: Scanlan strikes again. Looking forward to
seeing a bunch of you guys at GenCon. In the past

00:05:52.415 --> 00:05:59.214
four weeks in our 826 initiative, we have raised
over $50,000 from the community, which is then

00:05:59.214 --> 00:06:04.218
doubled by fantastic Mark K, we've made over
$100,000 to 826, so we can not thank you guys

00:06:04.218 --> 00:06:09.786
enough for your amazing support. Huge thanks to
critter Mark Koro, of course, for being our

00:06:09.786 --> 00:06:15.394
counter support for this, and being such an
amazing member of the community. Thank you. Thanks

00:06:15.394 --> 00:06:20.301
to Wyrmwood Gaming and our friends at D&amp;D Beyond
for their amazing support for the campaign to get

00:06:20.301 --> 00:06:25.556
us where we are now. If you'd still like to
donate, you can go to 826LA.org/criticalrole.

00:06:25.556 --> 00:06:30.754
We'll have more information soon about the
scheduling for my fireside chat, as well as the

00:06:30.754 --> 00:06:35.089
production crew Reddit AMA, and Marisha's Honey
Heist soon, so stay tuned.

00:06:35.089 --> 00:06:36.771
MARISHA: I need to start planning. Oh man.

00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:37.441
MATT: Indeed.

00:06:38.281 --> 00:06:42.248
MATT: Don't forget Twitch Prime. (singing) If you
have Amazon Prime you can connect it on your

00:06:42.248 --> 00:06:44.919
Twitch and subscribe to a channel for free, there
you go.

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:47.987
TRAVIS: That was a good jingle, actually.

00:06:47.987 --> 00:06:52.828
MATT: Thank you. I'll remember it never. Critical
Recap is available for those who have missed it

00:06:52.828 --> 00:06:57.370
before the episode and you're watching this now
and you didn't see last episode. Why? But if you

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:02.183
need to real fast, pause this, or later, or go and
watch Critical Recap now, which our fantastic Dani

00:07:02.183 --> 00:07:06.081
Carr gets you up to speed of what happened in last
week's episode. It's up on YouTube right now.

00:07:06.081 --> 00:07:11.750
Talks Machina is every Tuesday at 7:00pm Pacific,
where our fantastic Brian W. Foster hosts our sit

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:18.016
down chat with members of the cast. This last week
apparently was off the chain between Ashley and Marisha.

00:07:18.016 --> 00:07:18.813
MARISHA: Good times.

00:07:19.463 --> 00:07:22.566
MATT: When everyone cries from laughing, it's a
good night, apparently.

00:07:23.496 --> 00:07:25.290
LIAM: You face planted on the couch.

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:29.282
MARISHA: I've never seen Foster sprout tears like
that. That was amazing.

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:33.540
ASHLEY: You know you've got him when he has
projectile tears. It seems opposite of what should

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:34.256
be happening.

00:07:34.256 --> 00:07:37.498
MATT: A special shout out to our friend,
PulloutKing, from that episode.

00:07:37.498 --> 00:07:38.906
ASHLEY: PulloutKing, thanks for the laughs.

00:07:42.266 --> 00:07:44.726
MATT: We have new d20s restocked?

00:07:44.726 --> 00:07:47.529
LAURA: They're not new, but older d20s

00:07:47.529 --> 00:07:49.529
SAM: They're used d20s.

00:07:49.529 --> 00:07:53.577
LAURA: I'm pretty sure they're the special edition
ones. I haven't looked at the store, they're the

00:07:53.577 --> 00:07:55.049
red set, I think.

00:07:55.049 --> 00:07:56.570
MATT: The rare ones.

00:07:56.570 --> 00:08:00.319
LAURA: The ones that were available at our live
shows before are in the store.

00:08:00.319 --> 00:08:05.540
TRAVIS: Laura, would you consider selling used
dice that end up in the jail too often? Just

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.390
offload some of that shit.

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:10.473
SAM: I don't think the store can handle that many.

00:08:10.473 --> 00:08:13.406
TALIESIN: I think if the dice know that they could
go to a kinder, gentler home.

00:08:13.406 --> 00:08:17.577
LAURA: I think I may have enough dice to go to--
one for each and every critter.

00:08:18.467 --> 00:08:21.865
LIAM: It's funny, you go and try to pet her dice
they shrink back, they shy away.

00:08:21.865 --> 00:08:24.961
(squeaking)

00:08:24.961 --> 00:08:26.259
LAURA: They're like barnacles!

00:08:26.259 --> 00:08:28.968
MARISHA: Next charity drive we have you could
auction a few.

00:08:30.498 --> 00:08:31.586
SAM: Charity drive?

00:08:31.586 --> 00:08:33.612
ASHLEY: I was like: barnacles! She already said
that.

00:08:33.612 --> 00:08:34.937
SAM: Guys, the birthday girl is trying to talk.

00:08:34.937 --> 00:08:39.298
MARISHA: I'm sorry, never mind, it's passed. No, I
was thinking you could auction them off for

00:08:39.298 --> 00:08:40.704
charity next time, next charity drive.

00:08:40.704 --> 00:08:42.137
LAURA: I mean, yeah, charity.

00:08:42.137 --> 00:08:46.910
(laughter)

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.933
MATT: I believe that's the last of our
announcements of the evening.

00:08:51.933 --> 00:08:54.415
TRAVIS: Oh shit. A fucking troll, you guys!

00:08:54.415 --> 00:09:00.325
MATT: Let's bring it in for tonight's episode of
Critical Role.

00:09:00.325 --> 00:09:04.403
[click, TV static]

00:09:04.403 --> 00:10:22.533
[groovy Critical Role theme]

00:10:22.977 --> 00:10:32.576
MATT: Welcome back. Oh my god. Welcome back. Last
we left off: The Mighty Nein, upon clearing their

00:10:32.576 --> 00:10:37.497
names, making some new friendships in the city and
taking some time for themselves in preparation for

00:10:37.567 --> 00:10:40.885
the coming Harvest Close festival, found
themselves wandering through the streets of

00:10:40.885 --> 00:10:49.013
celebration. They partook in a number of various
games of chance and skill, got some fine snacks

00:10:49.013 --> 00:10:57.146
and foods, challenged themselves, got thrown by
their other party members, won some trinkets and

00:10:57.146 --> 00:11:02.162
toys, and then ended up signing up to the Victory
Pit, the grand tournament that ends the Harvest

00:11:02.162 --> 00:11:09.478
Close festival. You managed to catch a few phrases
off to the side of the initial lounge you were

00:11:09.478 --> 00:11:17.198
signing up in, where you discovered that war had
been declared by the king on the eastern region of

00:11:17.198 --> 00:11:23.503
Xhorhas, that information was to be held back
until the festival was over. You were held below

00:11:23.503 --> 00:11:29.169
with the other competing teams, and then one by
one you were each presented into the center of the

00:11:29.169 --> 00:11:36.432
Victory Pit tournament where each of you has to
battle a challenge of a creature or creatures in a

00:11:36.432 --> 00:11:42.834
three-tiered structure. Whoever survives all three
bouts gets to share in the final pot prize.

00:11:42.889 --> 00:11:47.602
Currently two of the other teams have been knocked
out, and it only remains to be you and one other.

00:11:47.602 --> 00:11:54.089
You guys are up first. You're pulled into the
center and announced as The Mighty Nein's final

00:11:54.089 --> 00:12:01.596
round. Knowing the Stubborn Stock is watching from
behind the distant doorways that lead into the

00:12:01.596 --> 00:12:07.226
central arena, you all scattered about the sands
as the sun begins to get close to dusk, shouting

00:12:07.226 --> 00:12:14.919
out your various plans and then abandoning them
last minute. You found places as these heaping,

00:12:14.919 --> 00:12:22.648
heavy thuds start quaking the ground in arrival
before the door swings open. Out from behind it,

00:12:22.648 --> 00:12:30.823
roaring, a frenzied, angry hill giant, complete
with pierced thorns jammed into each side of the

00:12:30.823 --> 00:12:35.983
body to drive it to a point of absolute anger and
fury, comes bashing into the center of the arena,

00:12:35.983 --> 00:12:41.195
knocks over one of the large pillars, and this is
where we begin. I need everyone to roll initiative.

00:12:41.195 --> 00:12:43.100
TRAVIS: Let's try and talk to it.

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:44.576
LIAM: Just wear him down.

00:12:44.576 --> 00:12:45.860
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's try and talk to him.

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:49.826
MARISHA: Almost a natural 20. Almost a 20!

00:12:49.826 --> 00:12:54.729
TALIESIN: That's mildly adequate.

00:12:54.729 --> 00:12:57.464
MATT: 25 to 20?

00:12:57.464 --> 00:12:59.988
SAM: 23.

00:12:59.988 --> 00:13:01.944
LIAM: 20.

00:13:01.944 --> 00:13:08.966
MATT: 20 to 15?

00:13:08.966 --> 00:13:10.255
LAURA: 19.

00:13:10.255 --> 00:13:13.735
TRAVIS: (sobbing) No, far too calm.

00:13:13.735 --> 00:13:18.112
MATT: 15 to ten?

00:13:18.112 --> 00:13:20.204
MARISHA and TALIESIN: 14.

00:13:20.204 --> 00:13:22.595
TRAVIS: Which one of you wants to go first?

00:13:22.595 --> 00:13:24.019
MARISHA: I'll take it.

00:13:24.019 --> 00:13:28.794
TALIESIN: I should take it because for now.

00:13:28.794 --> 00:13:30.735
MARISHA: Molly'll take it.

00:13:30.735 --> 00:13:35.356
TALIESIN: Make your life a little easier because I
can keep disadvantage for your turn.

00:13:35.356 --> 00:13:36.835
MARISHA: Sure, yes.

00:13:36.835 --> 00:13:39.316
TRAVIS: Eight. What'd you roll?

00:13:39.316 --> 00:13:43.550
ASHLEY: Six. The fun buns!

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:45.938
LAURA: Brought it back.

00:13:45.938 --> 00:13:59.058
MATT: All righty, friends. It finishes slamming
the large pillar into the ground and wields its

00:13:59.058 --> 00:14:03.734
giant club over one shoulder, its other hand
reaching out for something and glancing over the

00:14:03.734 --> 00:14:06.263
field to see what its quarry is. Nott, you're up
first.

00:14:06.263 --> 00:14:14.025
SAM: Is the giant in melee? Would I get sneak
attack damage or no? He's not engaged with anybody

00:14:14.025 --> 00:14:15.304
right now.

00:14:15.304 --> 00:14:18.250
MATT: Right now, Fjord, you're hiding back there.
I think I shifted it.

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:19.348
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:14:19.348 --> 00:14:21.052
MATT: No, he is not currently engaged.

00:14:21.052 --> 00:14:31.511
SAM: Okay, then I will shriek and I will run
towards Beau, full sprint.

00:14:31.511 --> 00:14:34.267
ASHLEY: Full sprint ahead.

00:14:34.267 --> 00:14:36.724
LAURA: Oh god, just right in it already. We're
just right in it.

00:14:36.724 --> 00:14:38.683
MATT: By the way, guys, this finally came in
today.

00:14:38.683 --> 00:14:39.970
LAURA: What is that?

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:41.422
SAM: It's north, east, west, south.

00:14:41.422 --> 00:14:42.821
MATT: So you know where the north is, so you can
use that.

00:14:42.821 --> 00:14:44.408
LAURA: Shut up. That's so cool.

00:14:44.408 --> 00:14:45.711
MARISHA: Which way's north, by the way?

00:14:45.711 --> 00:14:46.802
MATT: This way.

00:14:46.802 --> 00:14:47.886
MARISHA: Okay, thank you.

00:14:47.886 --> 00:14:52.581
MATT: The people who do Campaign Coins make that
now. Our friend, Deven Rue, who did our map for

00:14:52.581 --> 00:14:57.653
the show, she's the one who designed it. I've been
waiting for it to come in. That's a point for you

00:14:57.653 --> 00:15:01.798
guys, if you ever want to shout directions at me
of where you want to run, that's helpful.

00:15:01.798 --> 00:15:02.962
LAURA: I love it.

00:15:02.962 --> 00:15:05.587
MATT: You ran, full sprint towards Jester.

00:15:05.587 --> 00:15:13.238
SAM: Sneak attack damage is so good, but I can't.
That thing can see me, I'm scared. I'm scared,

00:15:13.328 --> 00:15:21.141
guys! I'm going to fire my crossbow. Ooh, it's a
two, it misses. I'm super scared.

00:15:21.141 --> 00:15:27.071
MATT: It arcs off, you hear this distant (yelp) in
the audience way away.

00:15:27.071 --> 00:15:31.424
TALIESIN: I was going to say, what was the number?
Because that thing's got to have a low AC. What's

00:15:31.424 --> 00:15:34.677
the actual number?

00:15:34.677 --> 00:15:36.808
SAM: Oh yeah, probably. Eight.

00:15:36.808 --> 00:15:37.876
MATT: Yeah, no.

00:15:37.876 --> 00:15:39.212
LAURA: He's got thick skin, I think.

00:15:39.212 --> 00:15:42.907
MATT: Yeah, it's a pretty hardy physicality even
if it's a broad target to hit.

00:15:42.907 --> 00:15:47.466
SAM: Then I will run back the way I came.

00:15:47.466 --> 00:15:51.911
MATT: Same place you were before?

00:15:51.911 --> 00:15:55.868
SAM: No, like behind Yasha, behind that pillar
over there, that wall.

00:15:55.868 --> 00:15:58.522
LAURA: You said that's north?

00:15:58.522 --> 00:15:59.768
MATT: This is north here.

00:15:59.768 --> 00:16:00.902
LAURA: Towards you.

00:16:00.902 --> 00:16:03.125
SAM: North always points to the star.

00:16:03.125 --> 00:16:08.167
(laughter)

00:16:08.167 --> 00:16:09.350
MATT: Caleb, you're up.

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:18.801
LIAM: I see this giant behemoth and I start
backing up to go west around the stone, under my

00:16:18.801 --> 00:16:24.977
breath singing: We are the Mighty Nein, the Mighty
Nein, the Mighty Nein. And fire off a Fire Bolt as

00:16:24.977 --> 00:16:26.690
I sneak behind it.

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:28.661
MATT: You're darting around the side.

00:16:28.661 --> 00:16:37.101
LIAM: No, that is no good. That is a 13.

00:16:37.101 --> 00:16:38.685
MATT: 13 just hits.

00:16:38.685 --> 00:16:40.810
SAM: Okay, not too hard to hit.

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:43.764
MARISHA: 13 just hits, good to know.

00:16:43.764 --> 00:16:46.685
MATT: It's a big target but it's pretty hardy.

00:16:46.685 --> 00:16:48.363
LIAM: That is a one.

00:16:48.363 --> 00:16:55.087
MATT: One point of fire damage. It hits and goes
(splat). It's less of a Fire Bolt and more of a

00:16:55.087 --> 00:17:02.455
fire (fizzle). You see there's a patch on its
rather furry belly that no longer has hair. It's

00:17:02.455 --> 00:17:04.115
very glaring.

00:17:04.115 --> 00:17:09.214
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>. I am leaning, crouching against that
stone, hands on the wall, just listening and

00:17:09.214 --> 00:17:12.725
working on keeping my gourd from rising.

00:17:12.725 --> 00:17:14.508
MATT: Okay, good to know. Jester, you're up.

00:17:14.508 --> 00:17:16.788
SAM: Go for it.

00:17:16.788 --> 00:17:17.599
LAURA: Really?

00:17:17.599 --> 00:17:19.329
SAM: Yeah, you so badly want to.

00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:23.429
LAURA: I mean, I want to so bad. I want to use my
Spiritual Weapon!

00:17:23.429 --> 00:17:24.886
MATT: Then use it!

00:17:24.886 --> 00:17:31.748
LAURA: Okay, well, I will. I'm going to hold my
symbol in my hand and do like this because I've

00:17:31.748 --> 00:17:34.592
seen Caleb do fancy things, and then I'm going to
make it.

00:17:34.592 --> 00:17:35.794
MATT: Where would you like to place it?

00:17:35.794 --> 00:17:37.213
LAURA: Right above his face!

00:17:37.213 --> 00:17:41.337
MATT: (counting) 30 is where you can make it
appear.

00:17:41.337 --> 00:17:42.646
LAURA: Really close to his face.

00:17:42.646 --> 00:17:44.225
MATT: Let me see what the range is on it. What's
the range on the spell?

00:17:44.225 --> 00:17:50.262
LAURA: I'm looking. 60!

00:17:50.262 --> 00:17:51.676
MATT: 60! Yeah, you can do it, right over.

00:17:51.676 --> 00:17:56.777
LAURA: Directly in front of his face, flat side
facing him, and then just poof!

00:17:56.777 --> 00:18:03.073
MATT: Roll for attack, go for it. As Jester
releases her grip, this giant, heavy-looking but

00:18:03.073 --> 00:18:09.853
gorgeous glittering lollipop apparates out of the
air, streaking down towards the goblin's face. Not

00:18:09.853 --> 00:18:12.523
the goblin, the ogre's-- giant's face. It's been a
week.

00:18:12.523 --> 00:18:13.867
LAURA: 16!

00:18:13.867 --> 00:18:15.287
MATT: 16 hits, roll damage.

00:18:15.287 --> 00:18:27.826
LAURA: That slipped out of my hand. It doesn't
count if it slips out of your hand. Ten points of

00:18:27.826 --> 00:18:36.742
damage! That's my bonus. For my actual thing, can
I do a cantrip?

00:18:36.742 --> 00:18:37.952
MATT: Yes, you can.

00:18:37.952 --> 00:18:44.335
LAURA: Yeah! I'm going to Sacred Flame him! He's
got to roll dexterity over 14.

00:18:44.389 --> 00:18:48.600
MATT: He rolled a 14, but has minus one dex.

00:18:48.733 --> 00:18:51.962
SAM: Look at you, you're a killer.

00:18:51.962 --> 00:18:58.088
LAURA: I'm a monster! Eight! Radiant damage.

00:18:58.088 --> 00:19:00.351
MATT: <i>Wunderbar</i>. That finishes your turn,
Jester.

00:19:00.351 --> 00:19:04.535
LAURA: Yes. The spiritual weapon's right here, on
his face.

00:19:04.535 --> 00:19:06.449
MATT: You got it.

00:19:06.449 --> 00:19:08.219
ASHLEY: He's blinded now.

00:19:08.219 --> 00:19:17.380
MATT: Now it's the giant's turn. After being
slammed in the face with this lollipop and the

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:24.704
flames, is like (angry grunting). Ducks out of the
way as it slams down on its head, grabs the side

00:19:24.704 --> 00:19:30.179
of the pillar, which breaks. The pillar, as it
fell over, shattered into four or five pieces,

00:19:30.179 --> 00:19:35.098
grabs and picks up a single piece. The only one
that it paid attention to right now is the one

00:19:35.098 --> 00:19:42.657
that lit its stomach on fire. It takes this thing
and lobs it in your direction.

00:19:42.657 --> 00:19:47.218
LIAM: I'm behind the stone pressed to the back of
it though, presently, correct?

00:19:47.218 --> 00:19:51.950
MATT: You do have cover. It's three-quarters
cover. What's your armor class, currently?

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:54.600
LIAM: It is at 14 at the moment.

00:19:54.600 --> 00:20:01.805
MATT: That adds plus five to your AC, so it's 19
on this attack. That's still a 21 to hit though,

00:20:01.805 --> 00:20:06.025
so it still hits you. 13 plus eight, sorry.

00:20:06.025 --> 00:20:07.540
LIAM: Well bring it on, here we go.

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:16.618
MATT: As this chunk of the pillar goes flying
across the arena towards you, it hits the top of

00:20:16.618 --> 00:20:22.404
the wall, which breaks, and a good foot and a half
section of it, shatters as it slams into your chest.

00:20:22.594 --> 00:20:25.167
LIAM: What did it do, it did to 19? I can do a
reaction, can't I?

00:20:25.167 --> 00:20:26.397
MATT: You can.

00:20:26.397 --> 00:20:27.640
LIAM: I cast Shield.

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:33.519
MATT: All right! There you go. As you see it slam
into the wall above you and go swinging, you throw

00:20:33.519 --> 00:20:37.922
up the shield and all of a sudden there's a spark
of arcane energy as it gets deflected inches off

00:20:37.922 --> 00:20:43.452
of the top of Caleb's head before slamming into
the side of the actual tournament arena, hitting

00:20:43.452 --> 00:20:46.601
the stone, causing it to crack, and people in the
front area (gasp).

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:48.734
LIAM: What did he roll?

00:20:48.734 --> 00:20:50.178
TRAVIS and MARISHA: 21.

00:20:50.178 --> 00:20:54.395
LIAM: Still hits. Because that only gets me up to
19.

00:20:54.395 --> 00:21:01.725
MATT: You were 19 because you had three-quarters
cover, because you were behind the wall. You had

00:21:01.725 --> 00:21:03.273
14 plus five because you were behind--

00:21:03.273 --> 00:21:04.674
LIAM: Okay, good.

00:21:04.674 --> 00:21:14.864
MATT: At this moment, the absolute fear kicks into
his eyes. The entity is going to charge forward.

00:21:14.864 --> 00:21:22.733
Right at that point, it stops and turns and sees,
out of the corner of its eye, Fjord hiding behind

00:21:22.787 --> 00:21:28.488
the wall. That's going to be its turn. Molly,
you're up.

00:21:28.488 --> 00:21:30.010
SAM: Turn into water!

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:34.033
TRAVIS: (blubbing sounds) Surprise, bitches!

00:21:34.033 --> 00:21:36.954
LAURA: Who's up?

00:21:36.954 --> 00:21:40.179
TALIESIN: I'm up. How dumb do I feel like being?

00:21:40.179 --> 00:21:42.677
LAURA: I feel like I'm already sweating.

00:21:42.677 --> 00:21:47.844
ASHLEY: I forgot to go to the bathroom. I'm
wiggling.

00:21:47.844 --> 00:22:00.649
TALIESIN: If it's turned towards Fjord, then I'm
going to run around to the opposite side of it.

00:22:00.649 --> 00:22:03.665
MATT: Okay, to there? Is it for flanking bonus?

00:22:03.665 --> 00:22:07.388
TALIESIN: For flanking bonus. I'm going to take
two slices into his leg.

00:22:07.388 --> 00:22:09.410
MATT: Go for it.

00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:10.697
LAURA: Two shots in his leg!

00:22:10.697 --> 00:22:13.629
TALIESIN: See, I didn't do it, and then you just
went ahead and did it. I'm working so hard not to

00:22:13.629 --> 00:22:16.505
do it. What's the flanking bonus, by the way?

00:22:16.505 --> 00:22:20.842
MATT: We've used it occasionally, but it works
against you guys as well. If you manage to get

00:22:20.842 --> 00:22:25.029
directly across from a creature with an ally in
melee, you get advantage on the attack.

00:22:25.029 --> 00:22:26.478
TALIESIN: All right, so this is advantage on the
attack.

00:22:26.478 --> 00:22:28.524
MATT: You were ranged last campaign so it didn't
come into play very often.

00:22:28.524 --> 00:22:32.469
TALIESIN: No, not very often. I was trying to
remember. I'm not feeling good about that one.

00:22:32.469 --> 00:22:36.736
Here we are. That's a 25 to hit.

00:22:36.736 --> 00:22:37.791
MATT: That hits.

00:22:37.791 --> 00:22:41.885
TALIESIN: I assume I don't get the extra bonus for
radiant.

00:22:41.885 --> 00:22:44.134
MATT: No, he's not undead.

00:22:44.134 --> 00:22:50.415
TALIESIN: (counting) Eight points of damage.

00:22:50.415 --> 00:22:52.192
MATT: Eight points of damage for the first
strike.

00:22:52.192 --> 00:23:02.413
TALIESIN: Then the next one is a natural 20!
That's 14 points of damage.

00:23:02.413 --> 00:23:09.851
MATT: The first strike you carve up alongside its
blubbery, thick belly that's flipping over this

00:23:09.851 --> 00:23:14.790
piece of cloth that it has matted around its
midsection. As you cut through, it buckles a

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:19.176
little bit on that one side of the leg and you use
that moment to cut behind its thigh, right down

00:23:19.176 --> 00:23:25.807
below where the Achilles tendon is. As you cut
across, blood spatters across the sand and (yelling).

00:23:25.807 --> 00:23:27.411
TALIESIN: All right!

00:23:27.411 --> 00:23:29.188
MATT: That's your turn?

00:23:29.188 --> 00:23:30.298
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm holding.

00:23:30.298 --> 00:23:32.130
MATT: He's going to use a legendary action.

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:34.939
LAURA: A legendary?! He's legendary?!

00:23:34.939 --> 00:23:37.594
MATT: He's a frenzied solo, yeah.

00:23:37.594 --> 00:23:42.462
TRAVIS: He's a frenzied solo? What does that
mean?

00:23:42.462 --> 00:23:45.940
MATT: He's going to go ahead and use his Furious
Smash.

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:49.296
TALIESIN: Is he going to attack me?

00:23:49.296 --> 00:23:52.035
MATT: He's going to attack, yeah, for slashing
him.

00:23:52.069 --> 00:23:58.008
TALIESIN: I'm definitely using Blood Maledict
then, at full use. That was not good, that was

00:23:58.008 --> 00:24:00.395
bad. All right, that's all right.

00:24:00.395 --> 00:24:02.517
MATT: Okay, so he has disadvantage on the attack.

00:24:02.517 --> 00:24:03.851
TALIESIN: Yeah, and the next one.

00:24:03.851 --> 00:24:10.511
MATT: That's still a 13 plus eight.

00:24:10.511 --> 00:24:11.756
TALIESIN: Yeah, that hits.

00:24:11.756 --> 00:24:18.667
MATT: As you slam and slice into the back of the
leg, he angrily turns back and swings down towards

00:24:18.667 --> 00:24:23.491
you and his eyes go black. There's a brief shake,
it's still a massive club and you try to move out

00:24:23.491 --> 00:24:28.298
of the way but it's too fast, slamming onto you,
knocking you onto the ground. Your wind is knocked

00:24:28.353 --> 00:24:42.968
out of you and your whole world goes dazed and
white for a moment. This is going to be 26 points

00:24:42.968 --> 00:24:44.266
of bludgeoning damage.

00:24:44.266 --> 00:24:45.481
TALIESIN: I'm out.

00:24:45.481 --> 00:24:46.593
SAM: What?

00:24:46.593 --> 00:24:51.338
TRAVIS: Wow! Fuck! Yes! Oh man!

00:24:51.338 --> 00:24:52.988
SAM: You wanted to.

00:24:52.988 --> 00:24:57.234
LAURA: I underestimated the amount of damage he
would do to us.

00:24:57.234 --> 00:25:10.230
MATT: That was a really good damage roll. It
reactively slams into Molly with the club. As the

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:16.254
dust settles, Molly is not moving on the ground,
probably pushed about an inch or two into the dirt

00:25:16.254 --> 00:25:21.872
and sand. There's a crater where the head of the
club had impacted, and Molly is not moving.

00:25:21.872 --> 00:25:23.668
LIAM: That really hurt, Charlie!

00:25:23.668 --> 00:25:25.964
MATT: Beau, your turn.

00:25:25.964 --> 00:25:27.861
LAURA: His name is Charlie.

00:25:27.861 --> 00:25:31.360
MARISHA: Okay, I feel like this has changed the
plan that I had.

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:36.763
SAM: Her plan was to hit Molly. It was a weird
plan.

00:25:36.763 --> 00:25:40.264
TALIESIN: He has disadvantage on his next attack
as well.

00:25:40.264 --> 00:25:42.820
MARISHA: Fjord, I feel like I should get up
there.

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:46.347
TRAVIS: I'm just saying, this is a last man
standing kind of thing.

00:25:46.347 --> 00:25:48.435
MARISHA: You're the only one there.

00:25:48.435 --> 00:25:50.850
TRAVIS: That's okay. Think of the team!

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:56.412
MARISHA: All right. Just this one time, though.
I'm going to throw a throwing star.

00:25:56.412 --> 00:26:00.112
MATT: You're going to throw a throwing star? Okay,
go ahead.

00:26:00.112 --> 00:26:01.634
MARISHA: Natural 20.

00:26:01.634 --> 00:26:03.988
(cheering)

00:26:03.988 --> 00:26:12.979
MARISHA: (singing) Happy birthday to me! Well,
that was the world's shittiest die roll, though.

00:26:12.979 --> 00:26:17.787
No wait, I only get 1d4, right? It's just a d4 plus
my bonus?

00:26:17.832 --> 00:26:19.750
MATT: It's 1d4 times two, plus your bonus.

00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:28.592
MARISHA: Okay, sorry. That's a better roll.
(counting) Ten damage?

00:26:28.592 --> 00:26:29.934
MATT: Okay, ten damage!

00:26:29.934 --> 00:26:32.241
TALIESIN: Way too happy about that ten damage.

00:26:32.241 --> 00:26:36.614
MARISHA: I don't get another one, right? It's just
one action.

00:26:36.614 --> 00:26:38.570
MATT: No, because unarmed attack, it's for the
outside, yeah.

00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:41.104
MARISHA: Okay, and I'm going to move.

00:26:41.104 --> 00:26:51.126
MATT: You throw one of these spindly jagged star
darts on the side. You throw it through the air

00:26:51.126 --> 00:26:54.939
and it sinks into its stomach. You don't even see
where it impacted except for a small red line

00:26:54.939 --> 00:26:57.275
where it's beginning to bleed from where it carved
into its belly.

00:26:57.275 --> 00:27:01.554
MARISHA: I hit him! Then that's it, that's my
turn.

00:27:01.554 --> 00:27:02.723
MATT: You're going to stay there?

00:27:02.723 --> 00:27:03.794
MARISHA: I'm going to stay there.

00:27:03.794 --> 00:27:05.778
MATT: That finishes Beau's turn, Fjord, you're
up.

00:27:05.778 --> 00:27:18.555
TRAVIS: I'm going to use my bonus action to cast
Hexblade's Curse on this giant. Hyuck Hyuck! I'm

00:27:18.555 --> 00:27:25.999
going to summon my Wastehunter falchion,
two-handed, and I'm going to cut into his thigh.

00:27:25.999 --> 00:27:28.698
LAURA: Isn't your Hex still up from the last game,
too?

00:27:28.698 --> 00:27:32.201
TRAVIS: No. It was up until the second round and
then that was it.

00:27:32.201 --> 00:27:35.533
TALIESIN: Also does that mean that his reaction
has been burned by the legendary action? Is the

00:27:35.533 --> 00:27:36.954
legendary action a separate thing from--

00:27:36.954 --> 00:27:38.275
MATT: Legendary actions are different from
reactions.

00:27:38.275 --> 00:27:39.858
TALIESIN: All right, so he's still got a reaction.
Just checking.

00:27:39.858 --> 00:27:41.711
TRAVIS: 25.

00:27:41.711 --> 00:27:50.939
MATT: That hits. As the large falchion appears,
curved and jagged, you see this splash of seawater across

00:27:50.939 --> 00:27:56.432
the side of the giant as its eyes are now set back
on Fjord. At this point, the curse sets in, the

00:27:56.491 --> 00:28:01.044
blood spatters on the ground begin to come up into
these black forms and adhere to his legs.

00:28:01.044 --> 00:28:04.229
TRAVIS: 13 points of damage plus two for the
Hexblade's Curse.

00:28:04.229 --> 00:28:06.029
MATT: 15, nice.

00:28:06.029 --> 00:28:12.379
TRAVIS: With my speed, I'm going to run to the
north as far as 30 will carry me.

00:28:12.379 --> 00:28:14.645
LAURA: He's going to hit you.

00:28:14.645 --> 00:28:16.434
TRAVIS: I know, he's going to hit me next turn
anyway.

00:28:16.434 --> 00:28:21.362
MATT: 30 will get you there, and he gets an attack of
opportunity against you. As you strike it in the side

00:28:21.362 --> 00:28:27.658
and you go to run, you get a fair distance, but the
reach with that club is just far enough where it

00:28:27.703 --> 00:28:31.807
doesn't necessarily need it. As you go charging
forward-- he has disadvantage because of that.

00:28:31.807 --> 00:28:37.731
That makes it a 13.

00:28:37.731 --> 00:28:39.475
TRAVIS: Armor class 15!

00:28:39.475 --> 00:28:46.116
MATT: You hear the (booming) from behind as it
slams into the ground. The earth leaves your foot

00:28:46.116 --> 00:28:54.846
for a second and you land again. You make your way
to the edge. Well done, that ends your turn. That

00:28:54.846 --> 00:28:56.488
brings us to Yasha.

00:28:56.488 --> 00:29:11.015
ASHLEY: Can I make it over east? Let's go east,
near his butt. How far can I get?

00:29:11.015 --> 00:29:12.922
MATT: You can get there.

00:29:12.922 --> 00:29:15.396
LAURA: Hit him in his butt!

00:29:15.396 --> 00:29:22.607
ASHLEY: I'm going to hit him in the arse with the
Magician's Judge. Reckless.

00:29:22.607 --> 00:29:24.284
MATT: Reckless? Go for it.

00:29:24.284 --> 00:29:30.058
ASHLEY: 15.

00:29:30.058 --> 00:29:31.527
MATT: 15 hits.

00:29:31.527 --> 00:29:36.222
LAURA: Does that mean he's going to get advantage
on you now?

00:29:36.222 --> 00:29:37.680
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:41.779
SAM: But wait, you get to dispel magic!

00:29:41.779 --> 00:29:47.288
ASHLEY: Oh shit, that's so bad.

00:29:47.288 --> 00:29:49.077
MATT: Double ones.

00:29:49.077 --> 00:29:50.864
TRAVIS: Are they really? Double unos?

00:29:50.864 --> 00:29:53.057
ASHLEY: Double unos. Five points of damage!

00:29:53.057 --> 00:30:01.162
MATT: As you go rushing by, you weren't paying
attention for the last impact, and you see out of

00:30:01.162 --> 00:30:05.049
the corner your eye Molly in the ground, jammed
in and unconscious, bleeding out, and that's just

00:30:05.049 --> 00:30:10.318
enough, being not in an enraged state, to
viscerally affect you and shakes you just enough

00:30:10.318 --> 00:30:15.163
for you to swing the blade. It hits the leg, but
it wasn't enough actual impact to carve into the flesh.

00:30:15.163 --> 00:30:16.423
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:30:16.423 --> 00:30:18.329
MATT: That ends your turn, Yasha. Nott, you're
up.

00:30:18.329 --> 00:30:23.079
SAM: (sighs) Do we heal, or do we get this guy?

00:30:23.079 --> 00:30:25.151
TRAVIS: You don't heal. Hit him.

00:30:25.151 --> 00:30:26.195
SAM: No, I mean Molly.

00:30:26.195 --> 00:30:27.682
TRAVIS: Fuck Molly!

00:30:27.682 --> 00:30:32.570
SAM: All right, I'll clock around the corner and
fire off a shot.

00:30:32.712 --> 00:30:34.744
MARISHA: He has potentially three rounds until he
dies.

00:30:34.744 --> 00:30:36.324
TRAVIS: I love Molly, but fuck.

00:30:36.324 --> 00:30:37.281
TALIESIN: I don't.

00:30:37.281 --> 00:30:38.505
SAM: 20 to hit.

00:30:38.505 --> 00:30:39.869
MATT: That hits. You can roll damage.

00:30:39.869 --> 00:30:40.748
SAM: Okay.

00:30:40.748 --> 00:30:42.747
MATT: He is adjacent to Yasha, so it is sneak
attack damage.

00:30:42.747 --> 00:30:44.322
SAM: Ew, terrible.

00:30:44.322 --> 00:30:46.135
LAURA: Oh my god! What's with these rolls!?

00:30:46.135 --> 00:30:47.185
ASHLEY: We're going to die.

00:30:47.185 --> 00:30:48.296
LAURA: No, don't say it.

00:30:48.296 --> 00:30:49.635
ASHLEY: We're going to live.

00:30:49.635 --> 00:30:50.968
SAM: Nine points of damage.

00:30:50.968 --> 00:30:52.342
TRAVIS: Not as convincing.

00:30:52.342 --> 00:30:56.620
MATT: Hey it adds up, guys. It's cool. As you duck
around the corner, you release the bolt. It sinks

00:30:56.620 --> 00:31:02.077
into the chest area and looks around in the direction
trying to find you. You still have 20 feet of

00:31:02.096 --> 00:31:02.703
movement.

00:31:02.703 --> 00:31:04.761
MARISHA: You don't have Healing Word or anything
anymore?

00:31:04.761 --> 00:31:05.730
SAM: No, I'm not a--

00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:06.896
LAURA: Nobody has.

00:31:06.896 --> 00:31:08.162
MATT: It's not a rogue thing, unfortunately.

00:31:08.162 --> 00:31:13.811
SAM: You can perform one of these (mumbling) use a
bonus action to control the hand. Fuck. Okay, I

00:31:13.811 --> 00:31:19.852
can't cast Mage Hand as a bonus action with
Legerdemain or whatever, right? I can only use it.

00:31:19.852 --> 00:31:26.153
Okay, then I will fire again, why not? Natural
20.

00:31:26.271 --> 00:31:28.224
(cheering)

00:31:28.224 --> 00:31:29.702
TRAVIS: So casual, that's a good--

00:31:29.702 --> 00:31:30.996
LAURA: Ah!

00:31:30.996 --> 00:31:33.231
SAM: Does that double my dice?

00:31:33.231 --> 00:31:34.317
LAURA: Yeah!

00:31:34.317 --> 00:31:36.170
SAM: Plus that's 16 points of damage.

00:31:36.170 --> 00:31:37.560
LAURA: Nice.

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:39.128
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.

00:31:39.128 --> 00:31:42.748
MATT: The first one hit, and he starts growling,
and looks right in your direction. You go

00:31:42.748 --> 00:31:49.474
(screams), fire a second one that goes right into
one of its eyes and starts roaring. It gets caught

00:31:49.474 --> 00:31:52.821
right up inside. It doesn't quite pierce the
eyeball, but it gets up into the socket.

00:31:52.821 --> 00:31:55.089
LAURA: (groans) That would suck so hard.

00:31:55.089 --> 00:31:57.071
MATT: It's scratching at its face angrily.

00:31:57.071 --> 00:31:58.560
LAURA: Good thing he's already frenzied.

00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:02.145
SAM: Then movement to clock right back around that
corner of the--

00:32:02.145 --> 00:32:03.093
MATT: Right there?

00:32:03.093 --> 00:32:04.573
SAM: Yeah, of the structure. Yeah, right there.

00:32:04.573 --> 00:32:06.435
MATT: Okay. That's your turn, Nott.

00:32:06.435 --> 00:32:07.153
SAM: Yep.

00:32:07.153 --> 00:32:08.761
MATT: Caleb, you're up.

00:32:08.761 --> 00:32:15.090
LIAM: I was considering going out there, but I'm
not going to do it. I'm going to bend around the

00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:23.920
side and fire off another Fire Bolt at it. At
Charlie. That is a 12 to hit.

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:29.740
MATT: That does not hit, unfortunately. It just
misses. As you see once again, Molly on the ground

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:33.941
and Yasha barely making an impact. Nott gets a
couple good hits off, and you try to fire.

00:32:33.941 --> 00:32:38.593
Unfortunately, as he pulls back to grasp the face,
the Fire Bolt goes wide past where the head

00:32:38.593 --> 00:32:39.861
previously was.

00:32:39.861 --> 00:32:44.297
LIAM: Yeah, I'm going to use my movement to back
up behind that column.

00:32:44.297 --> 00:32:45.580
MATT: There?

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:46.547
LIAM: <i>Ja.</i>

00:32:46.547 --> 00:32:50.180
MATT: That would put you about there. That ends
your turn, Caleb?

00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:51.032
LIAM: <i>Ja.</i>

00:32:51.032 --> 00:32:52.211
MATT: Jester, you're up.

00:32:52.211 --> 00:32:58.837
LAURA: Okay. Molly, I'll get you as soon as he
moves. Okay? So that he doesn't hit me. Okay?

00:32:58.843 --> 00:33:00.305
TALIESIN: (humming)

00:33:00.305 --> 00:33:01.785
SAM: (strained) I'm dead.

00:33:01.785 --> 00:33:08.853
LAURA: I'm going to move Spiritual Weapon around,
and I'm going to use this side. I'm going to smack

00:33:08.853 --> 00:33:10.457
him right in his funny bone.

00:33:10.457 --> 00:33:16.127
MATT: Okay. As the hand is grasping at where it
got shot in the eye, it goes right for the back of

00:33:16.127 --> 00:33:17.492
the elbow.

00:33:17.492 --> 00:33:28.814
LAURA: Yeah! That hits. Then 1d8 plus four. That's
cocked. Yeah! 12 points of damage.

00:33:28.814 --> 00:33:30.646
MATT: 12 points of damage.

00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:31.711
ASHLEY: Yes!

00:33:31.711 --> 00:33:36.956
MATT: As it hits, (impact) (pained groan) He's
shaking the hand as it's going numb. The one eye

00:33:36.956 --> 00:33:39.908
is half shut. Going (pained groans).

00:33:39.908 --> 00:33:44.179
LAURA: While he's shaking it off, I'm going to use
my bonus action to Toll the Dead!

00:33:44.179 --> 00:33:46.901
MATT: You mean your action. Because you already
used your bonus action.

00:33:46.901 --> 00:33:49.025
LAURA: I'm going to use my action to Toll the
Dead!

00:33:49.025 --> 00:33:50.825
SAM: I was thinking about you.

00:33:50.825 --> 00:33:53.379
LAURA: He's going to have to roll a wisdom of 14.

00:33:53.379 --> 00:33:58.144
MATT: Wisdom of 14. Natural 19, sorry.

00:33:58.144 --> 00:34:00.270
LIAM: (farcical Czech accent) Two wild and crazy
clerics.

00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:08.351
LAURA: Bullshit. So he saw me. I'm going to jump
down behind, north side. Northwest side, right in

00:34:08.351 --> 00:34:12.566
the corner there. I'm going to go (small squeak)
and try to not get hit.

00:34:12.566 --> 00:34:21.430
MATT: That ends your turn. It's now the giant's
turn. As Yasha has just torn into the side, it's

00:34:21.430 --> 00:34:24.015
going to turn back to you and is going to double
club attack you.

00:34:24.015 --> 00:34:25.541
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:34:25.541 --> 00:34:26.798
MATT: It has advantage on each.

00:34:26.798 --> 00:34:27.986
ASHLEY: That's so true.

00:34:27.986 --> 00:34:29.255
MATT: Because she did Reckless.

00:34:29.255 --> 00:34:30.907
ASHLEY: Because I did Reckless like a ding-dong.

00:34:30.907 --> 00:34:32.183
LAURA: So every attack against you is--

00:34:32.183 --> 00:34:34.585
ASHLEY: Yeah. I'm dumb.

00:34:34.585 --> 00:34:36.676
MATT: The first one is a 25.

00:34:36.676 --> 00:34:42.040
ASHLEY: Well that definitely hits. I'm probably
going to be unconscious.

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:42.993
LAURA: No.

00:34:42.993 --> 00:34:44.140
MATT: Natural 20, okay.

00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:46.552
TRAVIS: Oh no.

00:34:46.552 --> 00:34:50.865
MATT: The first hit is--

00:34:50.865 --> 00:34:54.869
ASHLEY: I don't know why I did Reckless. I'm
learning, I should have waited.

00:34:54.869 --> 00:34:59.324
MATT: 23 points of damage, bludgeoning damage,
from the first hit. (whack) You put your hands up,

00:34:59.324 --> 00:35:04.276
and you put the blade up to catch it, it slams
into it and pulls the shoulder out of the socket

00:35:04.276 --> 00:35:10.893
and pushes you down into the dirt. As you push
off, the club goes up once more and then (whack).

00:35:10.893 --> 00:35:12.560
LAURA: 23 was not the critical.

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:13.668
SAM: Not the critical?!

00:35:13.668 --> 00:35:14.657
TALIESIN: That was not the critical.

00:35:14.657 --> 00:35:16.146
SAM: She could be perma-dead right now.

00:35:16.146 --> 00:35:20.218
MATT: I rolled an eight, seven, and a five.
That's--

00:35:20.218 --> 00:35:21.739
ASHLEY: Am I perma-dead?

00:35:21.739 --> 00:35:23.313
MATT: That's 43 points of damage.

00:35:23.313 --> 00:35:24.254
ASHLEY: How many?

00:35:24.254 --> 00:35:25.213
MATT: 43.

00:35:25.213 --> 00:35:26.169
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:35:26.169 --> 00:35:27.293
SAM: What's your total?

00:35:27.293 --> 00:35:28.496
LIAM: What's your max?

00:35:28.496 --> 00:35:30.499
LAURA: She's got 40 something hit points.

00:35:30.499 --> 00:35:32.624
MATT: You have to go negative your max score.

00:35:32.624 --> 00:35:33.793
TALIESIN: Which you do not do.

00:35:33.793 --> 00:35:35.045
LAURA: Which you don't do.

00:35:35.045 --> 00:35:36.568
TALIESIN: So you're just unconscious.

00:35:36.568 --> 00:35:37.639
ASHLEY: I'm just unconscious.

00:35:37.639 --> 00:35:39.144
SAM: Just super-duper unconscious.

00:35:39.144 --> 00:35:40.866
TRAVIS: That was pretty close, I think.

00:35:40.866 --> 00:35:42.045
ASHLEY: Is that right?

00:35:42.045 --> 00:35:42.796
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:35:42.796 --> 00:35:43.938
SAM: Whoa.

00:35:43.938 --> 00:35:44.988
TALIESIN: You're out.

00:35:44.988 --> 00:35:46.130
LAURA: You're just unconscious.

00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:51.002
MATT: With the second slam, Yasha partially
deflects the first impact and then vanishes in the

00:35:51.002 --> 00:35:55.515
second one. Right there next to Molly, as the dust
clears, you see Yasha, unmoving, her legs up in

00:35:55.515 --> 00:36:00.107
the air, as the rest of her torso is pushed down
into the dirt, and the rest of the ground is

00:36:00.107 --> 00:36:02.930
covered over, where you can see the back of her
shoulders, and the back of her head, and the rest

00:36:02.951 --> 00:36:05.601
of it is dust settling. She's not moving either.

00:36:05.601 --> 00:36:07.197
LAURA: Shit. You came close to perma-death.

00:36:07.197 --> 00:36:09.829
TALIESIN: Yeah, but not. That almost--

00:36:09.829 --> 00:36:14.720
TRAVIS: (laughs) J-E-L-L-O!

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:18.804
MARISHA: I'm watching people get squashed in front
of me. Freaking kill box.

00:36:18.804 --> 00:36:20.884
LAURA: Were you still big, too?

00:36:20.884 --> 00:36:22.178
LIAM and ASHLEY: No.

00:36:22.178 --> 00:36:23.373
LAURA: Okay.

00:36:23.373 --> 00:36:24.625
LIAM: It's a quick thing.

00:36:24.625 --> 00:36:29.910
MATT: I think at this point-- yeah, because you're
the one who shot it twice in the eye, and it saw

00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:33.131
you duck behind. (counting)

00:36:33.131 --> 00:36:35.014
TRAVIS: Stick and move.

00:36:35.014 --> 00:36:36.623
MARISHA: That's my thing.

00:36:36.623 --> 00:36:46.201
MATT: You watch as it steps over the wall. "Tiny
thing!" After it smashes Yasha, it doesn't even

00:36:46.201 --> 00:36:51.571
care anymore and there's a little bit of foam at
the corner of the mouth. The blood's trailing down

00:36:51.571 --> 00:36:58.803
its face from where the bolt entered. That's going
to end the giant's turn. Molly, you're up. Molly?

00:36:58.803 --> 00:37:00.458
Molly.

00:37:00.458 --> 00:37:01.617
LIAM: Tal.

00:37:01.617 --> 00:37:02.665
MARISHA: Molly.

00:37:02.665 --> 00:37:03.608
TALIESIN: Yeah?

00:37:03.608 --> 00:37:04.721
MATT: Molly, make a death saving throw.

00:37:04.721 --> 00:37:10.015
TALIESIN: Oh, I don't have to. I get shocked from
my-- the chest. The heart locket sparks and--

00:37:10.015 --> 00:37:11.189
MATT: Oh, that's right.

00:37:11.189 --> 00:37:12.174
TRAVIS: The what?

00:37:12.174 --> 00:37:13.390
SAM: What, you're back up?

00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:14.336
LAURA: He bought that locket.

00:37:14.336 --> 00:37:15.632
MATT: What are the effects of the locket again?

00:37:15.632 --> 00:37:16.570
TALIESIN: What?

00:37:16.570 --> 00:37:17.750
MATT: What are the effects of the locket again?

00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:19.393
TALIESIN: Ready for this? It's really cool.

00:37:19.393 --> 00:37:20.465
LIAM: Full HP.

00:37:20.465 --> 00:37:22.774
TALIESIN: No. When you wear this pendant, you
stabilize whenever you are dying at the start of

00:37:22.774 --> 00:37:26.908
your turn. In addition, whenever you roll hit dice
to regain hit points, the number of hit points--

00:37:26.908 --> 00:37:28.918
MATT: Yeah. So you stabilize. You're still
unconscious.

00:37:28.918 --> 00:37:30.416
TALIESIN: I'm unconscious, but I'm breathing.

00:37:30.416 --> 00:37:31.459
MATT: But you're not bleeding out.

00:37:31.459 --> 00:37:32.840
TALIESIN: I'm just (deep breath).

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:34.574
MATT: There you go.

00:37:34.574 --> 00:37:35.967
LAURA: Yasha, however--

00:37:35.967 --> 00:37:37.149
MATT: Beau, your turn.

00:37:37.149 --> 00:37:38.931
MARISHA: He's looking at Nott pretty hard?

00:37:38.931 --> 00:37:43.257
MATT: Yeah. He's ready to smash the little
goblin.

00:37:43.419 --> 00:37:50.495
MARISHA: Okay, Beau is going to run and flank with
Nott over here onto also the northwest side.

00:37:50.495 --> 00:37:53.578
MATT: Over there? Flanking would be on the
opposite side.

00:37:53.578 --> 00:37:55.157
MARISHA: I have to be on the opposite side.

00:37:55.157 --> 00:37:56.107
LIAM: Yeah, you'll get advantage.

00:37:56.107 --> 00:37:59.187
MARISHA: No, I want to go in front of him, where I
can get his attention. The northwest side.

00:37:59.187 --> 00:38:00.228
MATT: Right here?

00:38:00.228 --> 00:38:08.756
MARISHA: Yeah. I'm going to point at his dick, and
I'm going to go: Tiny thing! Then for my action,

00:38:08.756 --> 00:38:10.625
I'm going to take the dodge action.

00:38:10.625 --> 00:38:14.383
MATT: Okay, so your bonus action is to say "Tiny
thing."

00:38:14.383 --> 00:38:15.629
MARISHA: Huh?

00:38:15.629 --> 00:38:18.209
MATT: Your bonus action is to say "Tiny thing"
towards his dick.

00:38:18.209 --> 00:38:20.605
MARISHA: Yeah. I say: Tiny thing! You tiny thing!

00:38:20.605 --> 00:38:24.744
MATT: Go ahead and make an intimidation check.

00:38:24.744 --> 00:38:29.247
MARISHA: To insult his penis size?

00:38:29.247 --> 00:38:30.680
MATT: Yes, that is exactly what you're doing.

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:31.554
MARISHA: Okay.

00:38:31.554 --> 00:38:33.349
LIAM: You have to intimidate his dick.

00:38:33.349 --> 00:38:35.261
TRAVIS: That didn't--

00:38:35.261 --> 00:38:36.785
MATT and LAURA: It landed.

00:38:36.785 --> 00:38:43.103
MARISHA: Well, it's a natural one. Well, the
second one was a one. First one was an eight.

00:38:43.103 --> 00:38:45.175
Neither were good.

00:38:45.175 --> 00:38:52.409
MATT: He seems to think you're agreeing with him
with regards to Nott. "I know! Tiny thing!"

00:38:52.409 --> 00:38:54.678
MARISHA: So I didn't get his attention?

00:38:54.678 --> 00:38:59.883
MATT: No. That's your turn. Fjord, you're up.
You're in the middle of the field and you see both

00:38:59.883 --> 00:39:05.500
Yasha and Molly crushed into the ground. This
little lollipop is (flittering) in the air

00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:06.661
behind.

00:39:06.661 --> 00:39:12.684
TRAVIS: Lovely. Yeah, I'm going to use Eldritch
Blast. Shoot across the arena, 120 feet. Try and

00:39:12.684 --> 00:39:13.853
hit him.

00:39:13.853 --> 00:39:15.202
MATT: All right. You move into the space here?

00:39:15.202 --> 00:39:16.056
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:39:16.056 --> 00:39:18.024
MATT: You can see him over the wall.

00:39:18.024 --> 00:39:20.948
TRAVIS: That is a 16 plus six, 22.

00:39:20.948 --> 00:39:22.421
MATT: That'll hit. Go ahead and roll damage.

00:39:22.421 --> 00:39:28.405
TRAVIS: That is 12 plus two, 14 points of Eldritch
Blast damage.

00:39:28.405 --> 00:39:33.512
MATT: Nice! That's a good hit. (impact) Off the
side of the shoulder. You can watch where the

00:39:33.512 --> 00:39:38.292
section, where the skin used to be is now exposed
muscle. Where it's burned off, the outer layer of

00:39:38.292 --> 00:39:39.598
the body.

00:39:39.598 --> 00:39:43.592
TRAVIS: Can I use the rest of my speed to move
behind the column, so that I'm hiding behind the

00:39:43.592 --> 00:39:44.740
column?

00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:45.694
MATT: Sure.

00:39:45.694 --> 00:39:48.021
TALIESIN: Was that with the Hex?

00:39:48.021 --> 00:39:50.433
MATT: With the additional Hex damage, right?

00:39:50.433 --> 00:39:51.991
SAM: Hex damage?

00:39:51.991 --> 00:39:52.988
TRAVIS: What?

00:39:52.988 --> 00:39:54.232
MATT: That was with the additional damage from
the--

00:39:54.232 --> 00:39:55.396
TRAVIS: With the additional d6, yeah.

00:39:55.396 --> 00:39:58.595
MATT: That ends Fjord's turn. Yasha, I need you to
make a death saving throw.

00:39:58.595 --> 00:40:05.413
ASHLEY: Okay. Do I add anything?

00:40:05.413 --> 00:40:06.481
MATT: Nope.

00:40:06.481 --> 00:40:07.623
ASHLEY: A seven.

00:40:07.623 --> 00:40:08.995
MATT: That's a fail. You failed your first death
saving throw.

00:40:08.995 --> 00:40:10.408
ASHLEY: (gasps) Okay.

00:40:10.408 --> 00:40:18.307
MATT: At the end of Yasha's turn, the giant is
going to use his legendary action. He has one

00:40:18.451 --> 00:40:21.074
legendary action. Trying to do a club attack
against you, Nott.

00:40:21.074 --> 00:40:22.580
MARISHA: No!

00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:25.961
LAURA: He has only one legendary action for the
whole fight?

00:40:25.961 --> 00:40:28.365
MATT: Once every round.

00:40:28.365 --> 00:40:29.350
LAURA: No.

00:40:29.350 --> 00:40:31.420
MATT: That's a 19. What's your armor class?

00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:32.562
SAM: That hits.

00:40:32.562 --> 00:40:36.861
MARISHA: I'm sorry. I should have been more
explicit about his insulting his penis size.

00:40:36.861 --> 00:40:42.078
MATT: 19 points of bludgeoning damage.

00:40:42.078 --> 00:40:43.268
SAM: Yikes.

00:40:43.268 --> 00:40:47.418
MATT: As it slams down, it hits you, and pushes
you into the wall. You're flattened against the

00:40:47.418 --> 00:40:52.933
stone which quakes. On the opposite side of it, it
cracks and (stones scattering) off the back. You

00:40:52.933 --> 00:40:57.752
hear this squeak sound as Nott is crushed between
the club and the wall.

00:40:57.752 --> 00:41:00.328
TRAVIS: I'll kill him! Not Nott.

00:41:00.328 --> 00:41:01.626
SAM: It didn't work.

00:41:01.626 --> 00:41:02.992
TALIESIN: You have to hit the confirm button.

00:41:02.992 --> 00:41:05.443
SAM: Damn it. Okay, that's not good.

00:41:05.443 --> 00:41:07.303
MATT: It's your turn.

00:41:07.303 --> 00:41:08.313
SAM: My turn?

00:41:08.313 --> 00:41:09.429
MATT: Yes.

00:41:09.429 --> 00:41:21.642
SAM: I will look up at the giant man who just hit
me and I will take out a tiny piece of pastry and

00:41:21.642 --> 00:41:31.179
let it crumble to the ground and look up at him
with fear in my voice say: Why don't-- (sighs) why

00:41:31.179 --> 00:41:41.024
don't goblins eat court jesters? Because they
taste funny.

00:41:41.149 --> 00:41:46.910
MATT: He looks very confused in the middle of his
foaming frenzy.

00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:48.860
LAURA: Behind the wall I start laughing.

00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:50.363
MATT: "Jester?"

00:41:50.363 --> 00:41:52.643
SAM: I will cast Tasha's Hideous Laughter.

00:41:52.643 --> 00:41:56.114
MATT: Oh, shit. (laughs) What's the save on that?

00:41:56.114 --> 00:41:57.341
SAM: 13.

00:41:57.341 --> 00:41:58.903
MATT: But what is it? Is it wisdom?

00:41:58.903 --> 00:42:00.017
SAM: Yeah.

00:42:00.017 --> 00:42:03.548
MATT: That is a natural 17 minus one, 16.

00:42:03.548 --> 00:42:04.851
SAM: Oh.

00:42:04.851 --> 00:42:06.231
MARISHA: Shit.

00:42:06.231 --> 00:42:07.932
SAM: Why isn't this working?

00:42:07.932 --> 00:42:09.289
ASHLEY: He's rolling well.

00:42:09.289 --> 00:42:10.542
LAURA: He's rolling really well.

00:42:10.542 --> 00:42:11.969
MATT: I'm rolling really well. I'm so sorry,
guys.

00:42:11.969 --> 00:42:22.246
SAM: Can I please get the changes to take? Yes,
okay. Okay, that sucks. I will bonus action

00:42:22.378 --> 00:42:23.319
disengage!

00:42:23.319 --> 00:42:25.839
LAURA: Yay! Run away really far.

00:42:25.839 --> 00:42:31.439
SAM: I will run away! Just the maximum amount of
running away I can do which is only 30 feet.

00:42:31.439 --> 00:42:36.138
Towards Caleb, to the north and if I can get
behind that pillar.

00:42:36.138 --> 00:42:37.522
LAURA: Don't group!

00:42:37.522 --> 00:42:38.579
MATT: You can get there.

00:42:38.579 --> 00:42:39.746
LAURA: Don't group up.

00:42:39.746 --> 00:42:40.970
SAM: Other side, possibly?

00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:43.350
MATT: If you wanted to go around that way, you
could.

00:42:43.350 --> 00:42:44.277
SAM: All right.

00:42:44.277 --> 00:42:48.842
MATT: We'll say yeah. That'll put you right there.
Okay, that ends your turn. Caleb, you're up.

00:42:48.963 --> 00:42:55.135
LIAM: This is a long shot, but I have no way of
damaging him. I'm going to pull out some sand out

00:42:55.135 --> 00:43:02.060
of my pocket and mutter a few arcane words and trail
it in front of me and cast Sleep back behind him

00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:04.581
here so it does not touch Beauregard.

00:43:04.581 --> 00:43:08.557
MATT: Go ahead and roll your 5d8.

00:43:08.557 --> 00:43:09.625
LIAM: <i>Ja.</i>

00:43:09.625 --> 00:43:11.411
MATT: Go for it and tell me what the total is.

00:43:11.411 --> 00:43:19.402
LIAM: <i>Ja,</i> I know. This is probably not going to
work, but I can't hurt him. Fuck. Good, better.

00:43:19.495 --> 00:43:21.146
23.

00:43:21.146 --> 00:43:28.285
MATT: 23? You watch as the large giant, (groans)
(slower groan).

00:43:28.285 --> 00:43:30.383
TRAVIS: What?

00:43:30.383 --> 00:43:34.142
MATT: Steps back and hits the pillar behind him.
It cracks and tilts to the side. Catches him

00:43:34.142 --> 00:43:44.156
(grunts). Falls to both knees and eventually hits
the ground. This loud, heavy snore.

00:43:44.156 --> 00:43:46.672
TRAVIS: Oh, shit!

00:43:46.672 --> 00:43:48.252
MARISHA and LAURA: Do we win?

00:43:48.252 --> 00:43:49.599
MATT: He's just unconscious.

00:43:49.599 --> 00:43:52.435
LAURA: Yeah, but does that mean we win? He's on
the ground!

00:43:52.435 --> 00:43:53.703
MATT: You shout this out?

00:43:53.703 --> 00:43:54.571
MARISHA: Huh?

00:43:54.571 --> 00:43:55.751
MATT: You're shouting this out as this is
happening?

00:43:55.751 --> 00:43:56.712
LAURA: Yeah.

00:43:56.712 --> 00:43:57.758
MARISHA: Do we win?!

00:43:57.758 --> 00:43:59.153
MATT: They're all waiting for a moment.

00:43:59.153 --> 00:44:00.633
SAM: Go heal Yasha!

00:44:00.633 --> 00:44:03.696
LAURA: Oh, we have to wait, it's like turns.

00:44:03.696 --> 00:44:05.416
MATT: No one's called the match yet.

00:44:05.416 --> 00:44:06.383
MARISHA: Fuck!

00:44:06.383 --> 00:44:07.446
SAM: Go heal Yasha!

00:44:07.446 --> 00:44:09.147
LAURA: It's my turn now.

00:44:09.147 --> 00:44:10.565
MATT: It is your turn, yes.

00:44:10.565 --> 00:44:11.657
LIAM: We're going round by round?

00:44:11.657 --> 00:44:12.542
MATT: Correct.

00:44:12.542 --> 00:44:13.500
LIAM: Don't touch the giant.

00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:14.549
MATT: Any movement, Caleb?

00:44:14.549 --> 00:44:26.011
LIAM: Yeah, I will start moving towards Molly and
Yasha as far as I can get. I call out, medium

00:44:26.011 --> 00:44:30.064
volume, not to the crowd but to my friends: That
wasn't even supposed to work.

00:44:30.064 --> 00:44:33.029
TRAVIS: Sand.

00:44:33.029 --> 00:44:34.283
MARISHA: You did good, Sandman.

00:44:34.283 --> 00:44:35.648
MATT: Jester, you're up.

00:44:35.648 --> 00:44:37.349
LAURA: I'm going to run over to Yasha.

00:44:37.349 --> 00:44:41.662
MATT: (counting) You can't quite get there.

00:44:41.662 --> 00:44:44.002
LAURA: Shit. Could I have reached Molly?

00:44:44.002 --> 00:44:45.799
MATT: You could have reached Molly, yes.

00:44:45.799 --> 00:44:47.420
LAURA: Okay, then I'll go to Molly first. Sorry,
Yasha.

00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:48.380
ASHLEY: That's okay.

00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:51.261
LAURA: I'm going to--

00:44:51.261 --> 00:44:58.696
MATT: Well, actually if you were here, you could
have gotten to there.

00:44:58.696 --> 00:45:03.937
LAURA: I could have gotten to Yasha? Okay, then
I'm going to-- because she's dying. I'm going to

00:45:03.937 --> 00:45:14.116
use Cure Wounds on her. My last spell, y'all. That
is 1d8.

00:45:14.116 --> 00:45:17.083
TRAVIS: That's all right, you're going to wake up,
and you're going to fucking go apeshit.

00:45:17.083 --> 00:45:18.629
LAURA: Ten points of healing for you.

00:45:18.629 --> 00:45:20.656
ASHLEY: I'll take it. Oh, thank you.

00:45:20.656 --> 00:45:25.539
I add that here?

00:45:25.539 --> 00:45:31.546
LAURA: And you're up! Then for my bonus action,
I'm going to send my Spiritual-- oh, no.

00:45:31.546 --> 00:45:33.523
SAM: You can do whatever you want.

00:45:33.523 --> 00:45:35.923
LAURA: No, I can't-- if I touch him, he wakes up.

00:45:35.923 --> 00:45:37.394
LIAM: Yeah, don't touch him.

00:45:37.394 --> 00:45:39.181
SAM: You can get it over there.

00:45:39.181 --> 00:45:41.914
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to bring my Spiritual
Weapon over to him.

00:45:41.914 --> 00:45:43.472
MATT: You can move it 20 feet there.

00:45:43.472 --> 00:45:44.860
LAURA: I can move it 60 feet.

00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:47.484
MATT: Well, the range is 60 feet, but as a bonus
action it moves 20.

00:45:47.484 --> 00:45:48.623
LAURA: I see, okay.

00:45:48.623 --> 00:45:50.035
TALIESIN: That's why I was like, get it closer.

00:45:50.035 --> 00:45:54.554
MATT: Next, the giant's turn. It stays unconscious
for the duration until something hits it. Yeah, so

00:45:54.554 --> 00:45:55.799
it's a minute.

00:45:55.799 --> 00:45:58.657
LIAM: Until we touch it, so we need to get in a
Goodfellas circle around it to decide who's going

00:45:58.657 --> 00:46:01.695
to beat the shit out of him, and don't touch it
before that moment.

00:46:01.695 --> 00:46:03.524
LAURA: We have a whole minute?

00:46:03.524 --> 00:46:05.626
LIAM: Caleb says. Yeah.

00:46:05.626 --> 00:46:11.545
MATT: Potentially, guys, here, figure out what
your plan is until someone touches it.

00:46:11.545 --> 00:46:14.590
LAURA: I can heal Molly while that's going on,
then.

00:46:14.590 --> 00:46:15.446
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:46:15.446 --> 00:46:16.814
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to give Molly a healing
potion.

00:46:16.814 --> 00:46:18.071
TRAVIS: He doesn't roll to wake up or anything?

00:46:18.071 --> 00:46:19.658
MATT: No, he doesn't. He stabilizes.

00:46:19.658 --> 00:46:24.649
LIAM: I'm going to move back by where Fjord is
right now, behind that column.

00:46:24.649 --> 00:46:26.809
MARISHA: Me and you take the head, maybe we can--

00:46:26.809 --> 00:46:28.105
MATT: Moving which one?

00:46:28.105 --> 00:46:29.810
LIAM: Stand me by Fjord, to the north.

00:46:29.810 --> 00:46:30.669
MATT: Okay.

00:46:30.669 --> 00:46:31.818
LIAM: Yeah.

00:46:31.818 --> 00:46:34.264
SAM: I'm going to take a healing potion.

00:46:34.264 --> 00:46:35.453
MATT: Okay.

00:46:35.453 --> 00:46:36.659
LAURA: 2d4, I think I roll it.

00:46:36.659 --> 00:46:39.416
TALIESIN: Does she roll the healing potion if I
take it, or do I roll it?

00:46:39.416 --> 00:46:40.726
MATT: It doesn't matter who rolls it, really.

00:46:40.726 --> 00:46:44.043
TALIESIN: Okay, because I was curious if my locket
gives me-- does it count as my hit dice or no?

00:46:44.043 --> 00:46:47.824
MATT: Well, healing potion isn't hit dice. Hit
dice is only when you're taking a short rest.

00:46:47.824 --> 00:46:54.180
LAURA: That's good. Seven plus two, so nine points
of healing.

00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:55.212
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:46:55.212 --> 00:46:56.476
ASHLEY: Thank you, Jester.

00:46:56.476 --> 00:46:57.627
TALIESIN: Thank you.

00:46:57.627 --> 00:46:59.865
LAURA: You're welcome, I'm sorry it's kind of a
weak thing, though.

00:46:59.865 --> 00:47:01.140
ASHLEY: I give her an awkward side hug.

00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:04.822
LAURA: (gasps) Thank you. I give you a big waist
hug back.

00:47:04.822 --> 00:47:06.114
ASHLEY: Oh.

00:47:06.114 --> 00:47:13.087
TALIESIN: I'm going to crawl behind there, and at
the very least I can--

00:47:13.087 --> 00:47:14.561
MATT: Behind where?

00:47:14.561 --> 00:47:19.524
TALIESIN: To the west, behind that rock right
there. I can, at the very least, keep trying to

00:47:19.524 --> 00:47:21.944
give him disadvantage on at least one attack.

00:47:21.944 --> 00:47:23.448
LAURA: I'm going to go northeast.

00:47:23.448 --> 00:47:27.053
MATT: Where, like over here?

00:47:27.053 --> 00:47:27.824
LAURA: Yeah.

00:47:27.824 --> 00:47:29.382
MATT: Anybody else?

00:47:29.382 --> 00:47:30.834
MARISHA: Yasha and I are going to flank his head.

00:47:30.834 --> 00:47:34.339
LIAM: I'll form the head.

00:47:34.339 --> 00:47:38.304
MATT: Okay, so you're going here, and Yasha's
going here, is that what you're doing?

00:47:38.304 --> 00:47:40.948
MARISHA: Yeah, we want to both try and get him in
the head.

00:47:40.948 --> 00:47:42.357
ASHLEY: I want to put points down on his--

00:47:42.357 --> 00:47:45.128
MATT: Well, you can't both go for the head, if
you're flanking. Either you can both get by the

00:47:45.128 --> 00:47:46.074
head--

00:47:46.074 --> 00:47:47.727
MARISHA: That's what I'm saying. We flank his
head.

00:47:47.727 --> 00:47:48.699
MATT: Oh I see.

00:47:48.699 --> 00:47:51.106
MARISHA: Sorry. I used poor language. We're both
by his head.

00:47:51.106 --> 00:47:52.606
MATT: That's okay. All right.

00:47:52.606 --> 00:47:57.075
SAM: Then I'll walk around the other side of the
pillar so I get a good clean shot. Am I within 30

00:47:57.075 --> 00:47:59.202
feet? I want to be within 30 feet.

00:47:59.202 --> 00:48:01.846
MATT: Within 30 feet, you would be there.

00:48:01.846 --> 00:48:02.824
LAURA: Oh god.

00:48:02.824 --> 00:48:05.953
SAM: (crossbow loading) Ready to go.

00:48:05.953 --> 00:48:07.866
MATT: Who's taking the first shot?

00:48:07.866 --> 00:48:10.530
LAURA: Then as soon as his eyes start to flutter
open, right?

00:48:10.530 --> 00:48:12.238
LIAM: Whoever hits big hit first.

00:48:12.238 --> 00:48:16.341
TALIESIN: Or also, because he'll get the one
legendary, but other than that, it's whatever we

00:48:16.341 --> 00:48:17.690
can get the fullest round.

00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:20.265
LIAM: Whoever can do the most damage with one
attack should go first.

00:48:20.265 --> 00:48:21.519
MATT: Who's attacking first?

00:48:21.519 --> 00:48:22.494
LAURA: Who's going first?

00:48:22.494 --> 00:48:23.763
ASHLEY: I feel like you could do the most damage.

00:48:23.763 --> 00:48:24.913
LAURA: Do it! Go, Beau!

00:48:24.913 --> 00:48:30.573
MARISHA: Okay. I look at Yasha and I'll go down
first. Right after me. Okay, ready? I'm going to aim

00:48:30.573 --> 00:48:36.394
right for his other eye socket, the other one that
Nott hit, and come down right in the middle, try

00:48:36.394 --> 00:48:37.754
and gore his head out.

00:48:37.754 --> 00:48:40.132
MATT: Go for a roll. It's a melee attack, you have
advantage because he's unconscious.

00:48:40.132 --> 00:48:44.579
MARISHA: Please don't fuck up on a sleeping guy.
14 and 15.

00:48:44.579 --> 00:48:46.392
MATT: Okay. It's an auto-crit, because he's
unconscious.

00:48:46.392 --> 00:48:47.722
LAURA: (gasps) Auto-crit!

00:48:47.722 --> 00:48:48.685
MARISHA: Okay.

00:48:48.685 --> 00:48:50.395
MATT: It's with your staff.

00:48:50.395 --> 00:48:54.606
MARISHA: Oh god, it's a one.

00:48:54.606 --> 00:48:57.501
MATT: Aw. Two damage, plus--

00:48:57.501 --> 00:48:59.489
MARISHA: Plus four, so six damage. That sucks.

00:48:59.489 --> 00:49:00.950
LAURA: Oh, that is painful.

00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:08.508
MATT: As you slam down, it hits right off the
ocular socket, and skids off the skull, (growl)

00:49:08.508 --> 00:49:13.699
the eye shoots open, the other one still swollen
from the shot earlier, opens as well. (roaring)

00:49:13.699 --> 00:49:22.972
MARISHA: I take my bonus action and Three Stooges
style, go poke, right in his eye. That's a natural

00:49:22.972 --> 00:49:23.843
18.

00:49:23.843 --> 00:49:25.128
MATT: You still get advantage because he's prone.

00:49:25.128 --> 00:49:28.082
MARISHA: Okay, let me see if I get that crit. No, 18
though.

00:49:28.155 --> 00:49:30.419
TRAVIS: Damn it, that would be great. Crit eye
poke!

00:49:30.419 --> 00:49:34.320
MARISHA: God, a one again. Five damage. Lot of
crappy damage rolls.

00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:40.650
MATT: Poof, right in the eye. (roaring) The eye
closes instinctually, and the arms begin to flail,

00:49:40.650 --> 00:49:41.657
as it's trying to--

00:49:41.657 --> 00:49:43.228
SAM: Are we allowed to attack, or no?

00:49:43.228 --> 00:49:47.026
MATT: No, because that's the end of Beau's turn,
now it's Fjord's turn.

00:49:47.026 --> 00:49:48.320
TRAVIS: Right.

00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:52.750
MATT: At the end of Beau's turn, it's going to go
ahead and use its recovered legendary action to--

00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:56.453
LAURA: Can you run away before he can get an
opportunity of attack on you?

00:49:56.453 --> 00:49:59.917
TALIESIN: Technically he hasn't had a-- oh, no, he
did, because it's a whole round back, never mind.

00:49:59.917 --> 00:50:01.812
MATT: It's been a number of rounds.

00:50:01.812 --> 00:50:03.537
TALIESIN: I'm working every bloody angle I can
think of.

00:50:03.537 --> 00:50:06.047
SAM: We weren't holding our action for when they--
I guess we never said it.

00:50:06.047 --> 00:50:07.132
MATT: You didn't declare it.

00:50:07.132 --> 00:50:10.812
SAM: Oh, fuck. I thought it was implied, we were
just waiting for it to wake up.

00:50:10.812 --> 00:50:14.094
MARISHA: I thought you said, who's going to attack
first, we were going to Goodfellas it. We were

00:50:14.094 --> 00:50:15.584
going to do that.

00:50:15.584 --> 00:50:21.234
MATT: Okay, well, from now on if you're going to
hold your action, please specify that. Those who

00:50:21.234 --> 00:50:25.863
were nearby needed to hold an action, that would
be you, Molly.

00:50:25.863 --> 00:50:31.022
MARISHA: Can I then move and try and jump over him
so I then flank him with Yasha? Can I use my

00:50:31.022 --> 00:50:32.770
movement to get to the other side?

00:50:32.770 --> 00:50:35.316
MATT: No, because if you guys were holding your
action to the trigger of you attacking, then

00:50:35.316 --> 00:50:36.704
they're all going before you do that.

00:50:36.704 --> 00:50:37.509
MARISHA: Okay.

00:50:37.509 --> 00:50:40.144
MATT: Cool. Take your turns.

00:50:40.144 --> 00:50:45.506
TALIESIN: I'm going to go ahead and say, (demonic
voice) You got hit in the face with a piece of

00:50:45.506 --> 00:50:52.786
lollipop! I'm going to attempt to do four psychic
damage and give him--

00:50:52.786 --> 00:50:56.444
MATT: That's a 15. 16 minus one, yeah.

00:50:56.444 --> 00:51:00.224
TALIESIN: (sigh) Will you roll under 15
eventually? Okay.

00:51:00.224 --> 00:51:02.412
MATT: I know, I've been rolling really fucking
well tonight, I'm sorry!

00:51:02.412 --> 00:51:04.296
LIAM: You gave him the die.

00:51:04.296 --> 00:51:05.307
TALIESIN: I know.

00:51:05.307 --> 00:51:08.342
MATT: It's also a DC 10, but yeah. All right.

00:51:08.342 --> 00:51:10.214
SAM: 23 to hit.

00:51:10.214 --> 00:51:12.462
MATT: You have disadvantage because he's prone.

00:51:12.462 --> 00:51:15.460
SAM: 22 to hit.

00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:16.646
MATT: Okay. Still hits.

00:51:16.646 --> 00:51:24.547
SAM: That is 13 points of damage.

00:51:24.547 --> 00:51:25.971
MATT: 13 points of damage? How do you want to do
this?

00:51:25.971 --> 00:51:27.916
(cheering)

00:51:27.916 --> 00:51:40.979
SAM: Trying not to hit Yasha or Beau, I would love
the bolt to go through its belly as far as it can go.

00:51:40.979 --> 00:51:44.519
LAURA and SAM: Right in the belly button.

00:51:44.519 --> 00:51:49.105
MATT: As it begins to thrash about, its one hand
hits the ground, kicking up all this dust and

00:51:49.105 --> 00:51:53.250
sand. The other club comes back, using it to get
up off its feet, it looks like it's ready to swing

00:51:53.250 --> 00:51:59.398
out towards Yasha and Beau, who's just finished
slamming into the creature. At that moment, you

00:51:59.398 --> 00:52:04.086
see the exposed belly that already has gashes in
it from the wound, and you wait and release right

00:52:04.086 --> 00:52:12.896
for the opening. As it sinks in, it stands up
anyway, and you watch as blood begins to pour out.

00:52:12.896 --> 00:52:17.163
You hit something major, and it's starting to
bleed out and it--

00:52:17.163 --> 00:52:19.553
LAURA: I did not expect that to happen!

00:52:19.553 --> 00:52:24.701
MATT: Takes a swing, and at this point there's
already blood draining out, and the swing goes

00:52:24.701 --> 00:52:32.132
wide, hits the ground, falls back onto its butt,
and proceeds to slowly go back to sleep forever.

00:52:32.132 --> 00:52:39.110
LAURA and TRAVIS: Forever.

00:52:39.110 --> 00:52:41.603
TALIESIN: (whisper) Shh. Go to sleep.

00:52:41.603 --> 00:52:43.215
SAM: Do we win yet?

00:52:43.215 --> 00:52:47.577
MATT: At which point there's a pause, this awkward
quiet before the entire audience at once goes

00:52:47.577 --> 00:52:49.298
(cheering).

00:52:49.298 --> 00:52:56.822
LAURA: I use my Thaumaturgy to start chanting,
Nott, Nott, Nott, Nott!

00:52:56.822 --> 00:52:59.476
ALL except SAM: (chanting) Nott, Nott, Nott,
Nott!

00:52:59.476 --> 00:53:01.592
SAM: No, don't draw any attention to me, no, don't
see me, no!

00:53:01.592 --> 00:53:04.778
TRAVIS: I look over at Caleb and say; No big deal,
right?

00:53:04.778 --> 00:53:07.413
LIAM: I pull my hood further down over my face.

00:53:07.413 --> 00:53:13.248
MATT: The cheers continue as the large goliath
steps out again with his tattoos and spiked armor,

00:53:13.248 --> 00:53:21.218
and he goes, "There we have it, the third round
completion of The Mighty Nein! But one more fight

00:53:21.218 --> 00:53:30.160
"stands. Congratulations!" You guys are then led
over to the holding area off to the side, as you

00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:33.560
pass your friends of the Stubborn Stock.

00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:38.820
LAURA: I grab my Spiritual Weapon as we're leaving
and drag the giant lollipop out of the arena with me.

00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:45.657
MATT: Leaving this large groove in the sand behind
you. As you guys walk by, the team begins to--

00:53:45.657 --> 00:53:50.197
there's this slow motion, like opposing little
league baseball teams passing each other.

00:53:50.197 --> 00:53:52.766
MATT, MARISHA, LAURA, and ASHLEY: Good game.

00:53:52.766 --> 00:53:57.550
MATT: You see Darrow, who gives this, "Not too
bad, well played." Gives a smile as he continues

00:53:57.550 --> 00:54:04.720
past. You see the dwarven crossbow ranger gives a
grin with his big scruffy poof beard. There's the

00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:11.163
half-elf woman with two warhammers that she's
spinning on the leather straps on the end. You see

00:54:11.163 --> 00:54:21.099
this really fucking old guy. This wrinkly, old
prospector-looking eyes through these wrinkled

00:54:21.099 --> 00:54:23.670
slits. (hoarse greeting)

00:54:23.670 --> 00:54:27.359
TRAVIS, MARISHA, and ASHLEY: Fucking old.

00:54:27.359 --> 00:54:29.340
MATT: I have no other way to describe him.

00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:32.205
TRAVIS: Old as balls.

00:54:32.205 --> 00:54:33.699
LAURA: Is his hair long or short?

00:54:33.699 --> 00:54:39.141
MATT: His hair's long past his shoulders, but it's
super bald skullet on top. You see there's a

00:54:39.141 --> 00:54:45.462
tattooed halfling, who's got his chin in the air,
grin and give you a show, and there's the human

00:54:45.462 --> 00:54:51.248
archer that has a longbow that's at the ready. All
of them walk by, all six of them, into the center

00:54:51.248 --> 00:54:52.517
of the arena.

00:54:52.517 --> 00:54:55.795
SAM: As we walk by, can I try to untie the old
guy's shoelaces?

00:54:55.795 --> 00:54:57.897
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check.

00:54:57.897 --> 00:55:01.202
SAM: 20.

00:55:01.202 --> 00:55:08.205
MATT: (laughs) He does not notice. It's not a
shoelace, unfortunately. There's a boot lace. You

00:55:08.205 --> 00:55:11.078
untie it. You don't know how much of an effect it
will have.

00:55:11.078 --> 00:55:16.586
TRAVIS: You just killed that old man. Well done,
Nott.

00:55:16.586 --> 00:55:19.029
LAURA: They looked pretty cool.

00:55:19.029 --> 00:55:20.059
MARISHA: They did.

00:55:20.059 --> 00:55:21.211
LAURA: Do you think we looked that cool?

00:55:21.211 --> 00:55:26.222
MARISHA: I liked how the archer was walking around
ready, all the time, maybe we should do that.

00:55:26.222 --> 00:55:28.438
LAURA: Yeah. Nott, always keep your crossbow
loaded.

00:55:28.438 --> 00:55:29.583
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:55:29.583 --> 00:55:32.088
SAM: But how will I drink?

00:55:32.088 --> 00:55:39.388
MATT: As you guys make your way into the holding
area, the doors close once more. As the goliath,

00:55:39.388 --> 00:55:48.291
Jermai Kull, shouts out, "For the final match of
the tournament, and the final round, the Stubborn

00:55:48.291 --> 00:56:02.716
"Stock!" The audience big shouts, screams, hands in
the air, then silence. (monster shriek) The gates

00:56:02.716 --> 00:56:06.781
on the side open as they all circle around and
look ready, not able to really ascertain the

00:56:06.781 --> 00:56:16.600
direction. All the gates open, and then barreling
through at the far side, you see a large 20-foot

00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:24.282
dragonoid creature with a long snout, wings that
have been carved and cut to where it cannot fly,

00:56:24.282 --> 00:56:31.988
and it's lumbering forward without its flight. No
arms, just the wings, giant clawed legs, and a

00:56:31.988 --> 00:56:38.474
long tail with a large poison stinger at the end.
This is a wyvern. A wyvern that's been prevented

00:56:38.474 --> 00:56:43.387
flight, and comes barreling straight to the
center. They immediately go into a formation to

00:56:43.387 --> 00:56:49.571
accept the creature as it goes. Darrow rushes up
with his battleaxe and starts cutting into the

00:56:49.571 --> 00:56:55.004
creature. You see this divine energy flicker off
the arc as it slams into the side of this, this

00:56:55.004 --> 00:57:00.382
flash of radiant energy off of his battleaxe. He
pulls away, his long black ponytail swishing

00:57:00.382 --> 00:57:04.071
behind from the arc of the blow. As he ducks out
of the way, the tail swings and he ducks

00:57:04.071 --> 00:57:08.806
underneath it. The archer pulls back an arrow and
the arrow flashes bright blue-green energy before

00:57:08.806 --> 00:57:13.295
it strikes and bursts into arcane energy on the
side of this wyvern. It turns around and grabs the

00:57:13.295 --> 00:57:18.586
dwarf by the head and begins to thrash around with
him in its jaws, throwing him about ten feet, he

00:57:18.586 --> 00:57:21.312
skids to the ground, falls unconscious in the
first round.

00:57:21.312 --> 00:57:23.146
LAURA: Just like you, Molly!

00:57:23.146 --> 00:57:30.069
MATT: The old armored guy pulls up a symbol from
his chest and begins to chant in the wrong

00:57:30.069 --> 00:57:37.053
direction, before the halfling grabs him and spins
him this way, and he goes, "Right, ha!" and

00:57:37.053 --> 00:57:44.145
continues his chants. Another weapon, a Spiritual
Weapon appears and apparates, but it looks like a

00:57:44.145 --> 00:57:50.031
large club of stone that begins to slam. The
wyvern spins around and its tail manages to impact

00:57:50.031 --> 00:57:56.372
the belly of the old guy as he finishes his chant,
and you watch him go limp and fall to the ground.

00:57:56.372 --> 00:58:01.070
MARISHA: Guys, I feel like we got the better end
of the deal on this draw. Kind of glad I'm not

00:58:01.070 --> 00:58:02.497
fighting this thing.

00:58:02.497 --> 00:58:07.435
MATT: The halfling with the tattoos tears his
shirt down and exposes all these tattoos on his

00:58:07.435 --> 00:58:14.100
chest, and he slaps them and begins to chant in a
Haka-style chant. He begins to (chanting). As he's

00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:19.515
doing this chant, all of his allies that are
standing begin to get revved up, before he rushes

00:58:19.515 --> 00:58:22.614
in and pulls a blade and strikes at the wyvern,
carving into its side.

00:58:22.614 --> 00:58:25.437
LAURA: Yasha, you should do that.

00:58:25.437 --> 00:58:30.411
MARISHA: We should rip off these guys' aesthetic
completely.

00:58:30.411 --> 00:58:33.325
ASHLEY: I just like the idea of the formation.

00:58:33.325 --> 00:58:34.637
MARISHA: Yeah, formations are cool.

00:58:34.637 --> 00:58:38.875
MATT: You watch as the dwarven crossbow ranger
rushes up and brings the cleric back to health.

00:58:38.875 --> 00:58:43.730
The cleric comes to consciousness and then brings
through a quick casting of a spell off to the

00:58:43.730 --> 00:58:48.681
side, the-- what's the other one there, it was
the--

00:58:48.681 --> 00:58:51.334
LAURA: Was the old guy the cleric?

00:58:51.334 --> 00:58:56.098
MATT: The old guy's the one that went down, and--
actually, no, the dwarf you thought was down

00:58:56.098 --> 00:59:01.846
actually gets back up. He wasn't unconscious, just
knocked really hard. He gets up, makes sure the

00:59:01.846 --> 00:59:06.183
cleric is up. The cleric heals some people around
them and they begin to curl around it. They

00:59:06.183 --> 00:59:10.340
continue to strike and back and forth, the
audience is breathless at moments. The wyvern

00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:15.692
jumps up on top of one of the walls, its stinger
spins around and jams into Darrow. You see Darrow,

00:59:15.692 --> 00:59:19.663
the leader, takes a blow to the chest, and he goes
unconscious on the ground before the wyvern

00:59:19.663 --> 00:59:21.430
pounces on him and starts tearing into the body.

00:59:21.430 --> 00:59:22.902
LAURA: He's eating him!

00:59:22.902 --> 00:59:28.249
MATT: The halfling, who's still continuing this
chant, rushes forward, leaps onto its back and

00:59:28.249 --> 00:59:33.476
begins carving at the back of its neck. The
elderly cleric begins approaching, still chanting

00:59:33.476 --> 00:59:40.574
in his mind and he's unleashing heal spells, and
occasionally throwing a bolt of energy, an

00:59:40.574 --> 00:59:50.051
electrical divine bolt of energy strikes the side
of the wyvern. The dwarven ranger unleashes strike

00:59:50.051 --> 00:59:55.130
after strike of the crossbow and the wyvern's
hitting whatever comes near it. Two more of the

00:59:55.130 --> 00:59:59.675
members go unconscious and it gets down to just
three on their side, before they manage to

00:59:59.675 --> 01:00:06.241
continue to stab into its side. Like a
long-running bull fighting ring, both sides are

01:00:06.241 --> 01:00:12.671
exhausted at this point. Three of the six are down
and the wyvern's still standing. Darrow has gotten

01:00:12.671 --> 01:00:17.708
back up and is breathing hard. He backs around the
side and they've all surrounded the wyvern who's

01:00:17.708 --> 01:00:22.165
feeling cornered at this point, blood pouring from
different wounds on its body. It gives another

01:00:22.165 --> 01:00:29.879
loud shriek. It turns around towards the elderly
cleric and charges him and with a giant sweep of

01:00:29.879 --> 01:00:34.243
its jaw, sends him about ten, 15 feet in the air
before he lands and rolls, unconscious on the

01:00:34.243 --> 01:00:35.296
ground.

01:00:35.296 --> 01:00:36.564
SAM: Does the shoe fall off?

01:00:36.564 --> 01:00:41.850
MATT: There's two left. The boot does dislodge and
arc an additional ten feet before resting away

01:00:41.850 --> 01:00:43.154
from--

01:00:43.154 --> 01:00:44.511
TRAVIS: Catching on the power line.

01:00:44.511 --> 01:00:47.414
MARISHA: Knock down the shoes.

01:00:47.414 --> 01:00:54.397
MATT: With that, the two standing members which
are Darrow and the halfling both charge in. The

01:00:54.507 --> 01:00:58.683
halfling gives a pat on Darrow's shoulder and
shouts out a phrase in a language you don't

01:00:58.683 --> 01:01:04.312
understand. Darrow seems to embolden his muscles,
rushes in for a strike and carves down with his

01:01:04.312 --> 01:01:08.102
battleaxe into the back of the neck after it
slammed into the cleric. As the blade sinks in

01:01:08.102 --> 01:01:15.821
about five or six inches, the large battle cry
that it gave shrinks back into this weird

01:01:15.821 --> 01:01:21.038
withering screech. As it whips around, Darrow
pulls his battleaxe out and backs away a few

01:01:21.038 --> 01:01:28.698
steps. The wyvern falls to its knees and with that
Darrow spins the battleaxe in his hands and carves

01:01:28.698 --> 01:01:34.430
off the rest of its head with two, three, four
strikes before it collapses. With that

01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:37.515
(cheering).

01:01:37.515 --> 01:01:43.214
LAURA: I use Thaumaturgy to say in the audience,
"The Mighty Nein are cooler still."

01:01:43.214 --> 01:01:51.434
MATT: (chuckles) The cheers are deafening at this
point. The gates open in front of you as the emcee

01:01:51.434 --> 01:01:58.239
walks out once more and goes, "An incredible fight
by the Stubborn Stock! Bring out our other

01:01:58.239 --> 01:02:05.898
"winners, The Mighty Nein!" The audience goes into
loud cheers. You guys step out into the arena. The

01:02:05.898 --> 01:02:10.415
same crew's coming out and dragging the body of
the wyvern off down into the depths of where it

01:02:10.415 --> 01:02:16.178
was originally unleashed and the doors close
behind. The clerics rush out and bring to

01:02:16.178 --> 01:02:20.395
consciousness the other members of the Stubborn
Stock. They all eventually rise, beaten and

01:02:20.395 --> 01:02:26.134
bruised and as winded as a lot of you look. They
give you a look as you approach and it's a "well

01:02:26.134 --> 01:02:33.666
done" smile. Wordless, but a nod of respect. Then
you to the right side of Jermai Kull, them to the

01:02:33.666 --> 01:02:41.860
left. "Raise your arms! For today on this Harvest
Close, you are the victors!" The crowd goes crazy

01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:47.187
once more, flowers and bits of rice grain and all
sorts of things are thrown into the center of the

01:02:47.187 --> 01:02:48.806
ring in part of the celebration.

01:02:48.806 --> 01:02:50.421
LAURA: Throw some money instead!

01:02:50.421 --> 01:02:58.370
MATT: There are copper flung from the audience,
from the row. You guys take that moment. While

01:02:58.370 --> 01:03:04.415
it's frustrating to share it, maybe, you made it.
One of the gates on the opposite side opens up and

01:03:04.415 --> 01:03:11.340
a group of seven individuals begin to approach in
various robes. You recognize a lot of them as

01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:18.861
people that were in the lounge earlier before you
entered this actual arena. They're carrying a

01:03:18.861 --> 01:03:24.979
small chest of iron and dark set wood and as they
place it on the ground, they begin to pull out

01:03:24.979 --> 01:03:32.801
sacks of money. They're presenting you the divided
prize. That's three rounds for the group and each

01:03:32.801 --> 01:03:38.577
round was 200 gold. That's 600 gold that you guys
get to divide and then the final pot was 2000

01:03:38.577 --> 01:03:43.230
divided amongst the two teams. An additional 1000
to your team. So 1600 gold.

01:03:43.230 --> 01:03:45.148
TRAVIS: Not bad.

01:03:45.148 --> 01:03:47.052
LAURA: Yeah.

01:03:47.052 --> 01:03:53.777
MATT: As the money's delivered to you, you acquire
your reward. There's a final burst of cheers from

01:03:53.777 --> 01:03:56.996
the audience and you're escorted back into the
holding area where the other groups have already

01:03:56.996 --> 01:04:03.079
left. They close the doors behind and it seems
like the fanfare's over, the attention on you,

01:04:03.079 --> 01:04:09.893
momentarily, has faded and it's just you guys, the
clerics, and the other group, the Stubborn Stock.

01:04:09.893 --> 01:04:13.543
LAURA: Did you say all the politicians have
already left as well?

01:04:13.543 --> 01:04:16.942
MATT: Last you saw, they were up in the stands.

01:04:16.942 --> 01:04:18.376
LAURA: Oh, okay. Okay.

01:04:18.376 --> 01:04:20.828
MATT: You guys just got back to the holding area,
taking a breath for yourself.

01:04:20.828 --> 01:04:26.960
TALIESIN: Is there a heal spell in the house?
(groan)

01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:34.689
MATT: Darrow goes, "That's a really good question.
Clerics?" The clerics say, "We've used most of

01:04:34.689 --> 01:04:42.028
"them, but I can offer a couple." They come up and
they give you a heal. You heal eight hit points.

01:04:42.028 --> 01:04:43.778
TALIESIN: That helps.

01:04:43.778 --> 01:04:46.012
LAURA: Heal Yasha too, she's really low.

01:04:46.012 --> 01:04:51.913
MATT: Yasha, you get one and then that's a ten.
You heal ten. Then two other spells are delivered

01:04:51.913 --> 01:04:53.876
to the opposing side. The other team.

01:04:53.876 --> 01:04:58.761
LAURA: Yeah, because they had a lot more people
that fell, actually, so they probably need it

01:04:58.761 --> 01:05:00.094
really bad.

01:05:00.094 --> 01:05:02.306
TRAVIS: That was very well fought. Impressive.

01:05:02.306 --> 01:05:09.017
MATT: "I appreciate that. I say the same to your
team. That was no small feat. I mean, literally.

01:05:09.017 --> 01:05:10.918
"It was very large feet on that gentleman."

01:05:10.918 --> 01:05:13.994
LAURA: But a very tiny dick, as was pointed out by
our friend, Beau.

01:05:13.994 --> 01:05:15.635
MATT: "As I heard that from across the way."

01:05:15.635 --> 01:05:18.066
MARISHA: Really, he doesn't catch nuance though,
so.

01:05:18.066 --> 01:05:18.995
MATT: "That's okay."

01:05:18.995 --> 01:05:20.381
MARISHA: Good to know for next time.

01:05:20.381 --> 01:05:25.654
MATT: "Apparently giants do not suffer the same
insecurities that most people in this town does."

01:05:25.654 --> 01:05:31.312
LIAM: What happens now? Do we just go home after
this or is there some sort of soirée afterwards?

01:05:31.312 --> 01:05:35.132
MATT: "Oh, there is, but in the lounge area.
Come!"

01:05:35.132 --> 01:05:36.905
LIAM: Who is invited to the party?

01:05:36.905 --> 01:05:38.226
MATT: "Well, the winners, of course."

01:05:38.226 --> 01:05:39.339
MARISHA: Is there free booze?

01:05:39.339 --> 01:05:40.374
MATT: "Most likely."

01:05:40.374 --> 01:05:41.338
MARISHA: All right.

01:05:41.338 --> 01:05:42.341
MATT: "Come on!"

01:05:42.341 --> 01:05:43.481
TALIESIN: I need a drink.

01:05:43.481 --> 01:05:48.007
MATT: The dwarf behind you goes, "Oh, aye. I could
go with that one too. (grunts)" He's holding his

01:05:48.007 --> 01:05:53.899
back. The half-elf who had the two warhammers
goes, "Oh, don't worry, honey." Scruffs his hair.

01:05:53.899 --> 01:05:59.489
He goes, "Stop it!" He puts his arm around her
waist and the two walk off together.

01:05:59.489 --> 01:06:02.074
TRAVIS: Dwarf got game.

01:06:02.074 --> 01:06:03.646
LAURA: They're cute together.

01:06:03.646 --> 01:06:08.580
MATT: You're led back to the lounge where you had
originally signed up for this, also the same place

01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:13.195
where you had overheard the conversation with
Starosta. As you enter now, it's still that

01:06:13.195 --> 01:06:18.616
low-lit interior with the fine furniture,
cushions. The food spread has been refilled. The

01:06:18.616 --> 01:06:21.549
drinks are poured. The servants are going around
with their trays to make sure that everyone has

01:06:21.549 --> 01:06:26.626
opportunity to eat and drink as you go. Inside,
however, it is a little busier than the last time

01:06:26.626 --> 01:06:31.222
you recall. The Starosta, Wyatt, is there as well,
currently entertaining a few guests in there.

01:06:31.222 --> 01:06:37.504
There's a couple of well-dressed merchants that
look like they're dressed in the same way that

01:06:37.504 --> 01:06:42.034
many of travelers from the Menagerie Coast are.
There's one of them who looks like they're wearing

01:06:42.034 --> 01:06:52.210
clothing that's a little more exotic than you're
familiar with. You do also see, within this area--

01:06:52.210 --> 01:07:04.597
let's see here. You see Lawmaster Orentha
Stonegrasp, there with her gray, curled hair, the

01:07:04.597 --> 01:07:06.756
older dwarven Lawmaster of Zadash.

01:07:06.756 --> 01:07:09.419
LAURA: Oh, she's the one that we talked to
before.

01:07:09.419 --> 01:07:16.170
MATT: Briefly, yeah. You had one encounter with.
Alongside her is Dolan Thrym and two other people

01:07:16.170 --> 01:07:17.477
you haven't met.

01:07:17.477 --> 01:07:19.548
SAM, MARISHA, and LAURA: Dolan.

01:07:19.548 --> 01:07:21.002
LAURA: The guy from the--

01:07:21.002 --> 01:07:22.096
SAM: Our Dolan.

01:07:22.096 --> 01:07:25.117
LIAM: Are they totally visible to us? What are
their physical appearance?

01:07:25.117 --> 01:07:27.867
MATT: Oh the what-- what?

01:07:27.867 --> 01:07:29.779
LIAM: The people that are with Dolan, what do they
look like?

01:07:29.779 --> 01:07:36.109
MATT: Oh. They both appear to be wearing similar
dull gold robes as to what you've seen members of

01:07:36.109 --> 01:07:41.797
the King's Hall wear. But they're a little more
casual. They're not quite as presentory or

01:07:41.797 --> 01:07:43.097
"in-the-office" mode.

01:07:43.097 --> 01:07:48.216
TRAVIS: The individuals that are in the more
exotic clothing than we're used to, what can we see of

01:07:48.338 --> 01:07:49.789
them? What do they look like?

01:07:49.789 --> 01:07:55.399
MATT: Well, there's two people dressed in merchant
garb that you see, the colors and the silks and

01:07:55.399 --> 01:08:01.878
the billowing pants and the jewellery is very
reminiscent of Menagerie Coast where it has a lot

01:08:01.878 --> 01:08:08.046
of finger chains that attach to rings and it's
this very presentory jewelry, that isn't classic

01:08:08.046 --> 01:08:13.580
European in visual aesthetic. You've seen it
around in town where you grew up so you gather

01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:22.135
these people are from Menagerie Coast folk. The
one who looks very exotic has very light linen

01:08:22.135 --> 01:08:31.795
outfit that is a dull eggshell white, but then
has trim that is gold and purple. The pants are a

01:08:31.795 --> 01:08:40.109
deep blue. Short black hair, dark skin, bright
smile, but you don't notice any other cultural

01:08:40.109 --> 01:08:43.676
touchstones that you have any previous experience
with.

01:08:43.676 --> 01:08:46.966
LAURA: Have I ever seen an outfit like that
before?

01:08:46.966 --> 01:08:52.706
MATT: You may have seen things similar to it
passing through your town from a distance or from

01:08:52.706 --> 01:08:57.280
your mom's place of business, but nothing that you
would necessarily know. Roll a history check,

01:08:57.280 --> 01:08:58.516
actually.

01:08:58.516 --> 01:09:04.093
SAM: She knows her history.

01:09:04.093 --> 01:09:06.500
LAURA: 19?

01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:11.742
MATT: Actually. You get the sense that this is
probably Marquesian. He's probably travelled from

01:09:11.742 --> 01:09:16.452
Marquet, which is a long way away. Very rare that
you find people coming all the way from Marquet to

01:09:16.452 --> 01:09:21.754
the Empire, especially. Menagerie Coast a little
more often, but this is something different. As you

01:09:21.754 --> 01:09:29.190
approach and enter, the Stubborn Stock immediately
scatter to the food and drink. Starosta Wyatt, who

01:09:29.190 --> 01:09:35.476
you had seen briefly but not actually engaged with
before, stands up as tall as a halfling can as you

01:09:35.476 --> 01:09:41.768
approach with his curly, matted hair and the
shocks of white and gray on the sides. His arms

01:09:41.768 --> 01:09:46.897
open and he goes, "Congratulations! I just had to
come and tell you personally a fantastic display.

01:09:46.897 --> 01:09:52.049
"Come closer, please, I want to meet all of you."
He starts putting hands out to meet you. "What's

01:09:52.049 --> 01:09:53.254
"your name?"

01:09:53.254 --> 01:09:54.865
ASHLEY: Hello. I am Yasha.

01:09:54.865 --> 01:09:59.043
MATT: "Yasha. Pleasure to meet you. Fantastic
performance. You're a mighty warrior. I'm really

01:09:59.043 --> 01:10:00.254
"impressed."

01:10:00.254 --> 01:10:01.513
ASHLEY: Thank you very much.

01:10:01.513 --> 01:10:02.569
MATT: "Oh. You are?"

01:10:02.569 --> 01:10:04.164
TALIESIN: Molly. Charmed.

01:10:04.164 --> 01:10:05.904
MATT: "Molly Charmed. Good, pleasure to meet
you."

01:10:05.904 --> 01:10:06.820
TALIESIN: That'll do.

01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:08.207
MATT: "Fantastic. You, miss?"

01:10:08.207 --> 01:10:10.263
LAURA: Lady Fancypants McGee.

01:10:10.263 --> 01:10:12.513
MATT: "That's a curious name."

01:10:12.513 --> 01:10:13.500
LAURA: So nice to meet you.

01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:18.927
MATT: "Pleasure to meet you as well. Pants are
rather fancy, well done. You there, little missy?"

01:10:18.927 --> 01:10:21.383
SAM: Hi. I'm just Pam.

01:10:21.383 --> 01:10:27.572
MATT: "Pam. Pleasure. Shy. That's okay, that's
allowed. What's your name?"

01:10:27.572 --> 01:10:28.650
LIAM: Caleb.

01:10:28.650 --> 01:10:30.688
MATT: "Caleb. Pleasure, pleasure to meet you. You
are?"

01:10:30.688 --> 01:10:31.755
MARISHA: Beau.

01:10:31.755 --> 01:10:37.772
MATT: "Beau. Well, pleasure to meet you as well.
And you, sir?"

01:10:37.882 --> 01:10:40.249
TRAVIS: Fjord. It's been an honor fighting in your
Victory Pit.

01:10:40.249 --> 01:10:45.415
MATT: "Oh, well, I will tell you, a brilliant
display of skill and precisely the kind of

01:10:45.415 --> 01:10:53.023
"showmanship the fine people of Zadash need right
now. I appreciate your being a part of this. It's

01:10:53.023 --> 01:10:55.311
"well-earned victory and--"

01:10:55.311 --> 01:10:58.276
SAM: Was this person in the conversation I was
spying on before?

01:10:58.276 --> 01:11:00.647
MATT: Yes. He was the one who was being notified.
This is the Starosta of Zadash.

01:11:00.647 --> 01:11:01.909
SAM: Okay.

01:11:01.909 --> 01:11:07.046
TRAVIS: Have tensions eased in the city a bit
since, you know, the incident?

01:11:07.046 --> 01:11:09.675
MATT: "The incident?"

01:11:09.675 --> 01:11:13.063
TRAVIS: Well, in the tower with the-- yeah.

01:11:13.063 --> 01:11:17.701
MATT: "Oh, right. Well, we've taken care of that
for the time being. Repairs have been made, the

01:11:17.701 --> 01:11:24.346
"tower's back where it was. The individuals you
probably want to talk to about that are over there

01:11:24.346 --> 01:11:29.906
"in the corner." They were faced away from you when
you first entered, but looking out from the far

01:11:29.906 --> 01:11:34.369
window that leads to the outside, you see two
figures faced away, looking outward, holding

01:11:34.369 --> 01:11:40.065
glasses of wine. It looks to be the two figures
you saw when you first entered the ring, Oremid

01:11:40.065 --> 01:11:49.726
Hass, the headmaster of the Zauber Spire. Or the
Halls of Erudition.

01:11:49.726 --> 01:11:51.334
LAURA: Then the dude in the white robes?

01:11:51.334 --> 01:11:52.421
MATT: The dude in the white robes.

01:11:52.421 --> 01:11:53.504
MARISHA: Oh shit.

01:11:53.504 --> 01:11:57.294
LIAM: They were the two that were just pointed out
to all of us.

01:11:57.294 --> 01:12:01.432
MATT: Yes. They were just facing away from you
guys. Wyatt Fedar says, "If you want to enquire

01:12:01.432 --> 01:12:08.088
"the specifics, they'd be the ones to talk to. I
will say, I've recently been notified by

01:12:08.088 --> 01:12:12.887
"Stonegrasp." He points over to the Lawmaster,
who's in conversation on the side with her own

01:12:12.887 --> 01:12:18.203
people. "That you had already completed some
dangerous contract work for the city, is that

01:12:18.203 --> 01:12:19.188
"correct?"

01:12:19.188 --> 01:12:22.716
TRAVIS: That's indeed true, yeah. We found
ourselves in harm's way. We're always looking for

01:12:22.716 --> 01:12:26.348
the next bit of adventure to put some coin in our
pockets and do the city some good.

01:12:26.348 --> 01:12:27.624
MATT: "That's fantastic."

01:12:27.624 --> 01:12:28.927
LAURA: We beat a spider.

01:12:28.927 --> 01:12:32.928
MATT: "That's the one she mentioned. That thing
had been a problem for some time, I hear, so it's

01:12:32.928 --> 01:12:38.005
"greatly appreciated. You've done twice now, a
great service for this city. Well, this evening is

01:12:38.005 --> 01:12:45.526
"yours to celebrate. Things shifting as they are,
we may have need of upstanding and skilled

01:12:45.526 --> 01:12:50.427
"citizens of the Empire such as yourselves in the
near future. Should you be interested, that is."

01:12:50.427 --> 01:12:56.353
LAURA: Is everything okay, Starosta? You seem
rather stressed. I'm good at spotting these things.

01:12:56.353 --> 01:13:01.931
MATT: "I appreciate that. My position here comes
with a number of responsibilities so at any given

01:13:01.931 --> 01:13:09.765
"point in time I'm probably am very visibly
stretched, but I'm doing the best I can. I

01:13:09.765 --> 01:13:12.568
"appreciate that. Where might we contact you,
should we be so interested?"

01:13:12.568 --> 01:13:16.857
TRAVIS: Well, we're frequently at the-- what the
name was the--

01:13:16.857 --> 01:13:17.938
LAURA: The Leaky Tap.

01:13:17.938 --> 01:13:18.966
TRAVIS: The Leaky Tap. Yep.

01:13:18.966 --> 01:13:20.140
MATT: "Leaky Tap Tavern, okay."

01:13:20.140 --> 01:13:21.434
TALIESIN: Frequently, not always.

01:13:21.434 --> 01:13:24.758
LAURA: Yeah. Sometimes we stay at the Pillow
Trove, you know.

01:13:24.758 --> 01:13:26.334
TALIESIN: Sometimes we're out and about.

01:13:26.334 --> 01:13:31.642
MATT: "All right. Well, good to know. Should we
have need of you, we'll know where to come and

01:13:31.642 --> 01:13:32.612
"find you."

01:13:32.612 --> 01:13:37.335
TRAVIS: Actually, on the Pillow Trove: you know,
sometimes people don't quite know the services we

01:13:37.335 --> 01:13:42.567
do for the city. Sure would help if we had some
sort of slip or badge that would allow us to move

01:13:42.567 --> 01:13:44.109
more freely, you know?

01:13:44.109 --> 01:13:45.227
LIAM: Through the gates.

01:13:45.227 --> 01:13:51.525
MATT: "Oh well, that's not a worry, I don't think.
Simon!" Hits the side of the chair and one of the

01:13:51.525 --> 01:13:57.238
crownsguard comes up, but a more decorated
crownsguard. Looks like he holds more status and

01:13:57.238 --> 01:14:02.474
he goes, "Yes, Starosta?" He looks about and says,
"Can we ensure that the rest of your body of

01:14:02.474 --> 01:14:08.676
"soldiers understand that these fine champions of
this year's Harvest Close festival are allowed

01:14:08.676 --> 01:14:16.304
"entry and exit from our fine Tri-Spires?" He's
like, "Yes, sir. We will make sure that the

01:14:16.304 --> 01:14:21.569
"Crownsguard are aware of The Mighty Nein and their
ability to pass in and out unimpeded."

01:14:21.674 --> 01:14:22.931
TRAVIS: Most gracious of you.

01:14:22.931 --> 01:14:24.146
LAURA: Thank you so much. What is your name?

01:14:24.146 --> 01:14:34.224
MATT: "Oh, I'm Jeremiah. Captain Jeremiah. I'm--
anyway. Well done, well fought." He takes a step

01:14:34.224 --> 01:14:37.107
back out of the conversation and you get the sense
that there's a little bit of a hierarchy there

01:14:37.107 --> 01:14:41.376
where the Starosta, not meaning to, but there's a
very much, "I should not be part of this

01:14:41.376 --> 01:14:48.460
"conversation," and he steps out of it. "Well. Very
well. Look, enjoy your well-earned evening of

01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:58.872
"revelry as much as you can. I have a sense there
are some stressful days ahead so enjoy it. Rest

01:14:58.872 --> 01:15:01.492
"well." Takes his glass and drinks to you.

01:15:01.492 --> 01:15:03.841
SAM: To a better tomorrow!

01:15:03.841 --> 01:15:11.440
MATT: "Indeed, young girl." He turns around and
sits up on the couch, and re-engages in

01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:15.041
conversation with one of his various guests.

01:15:15.041 --> 01:15:16.818
TRAVIS: He certainly seems stressed.

01:15:16.818 --> 01:15:18.442
SAM: He's going to die tomorrow in war.

01:15:18.442 --> 01:15:19.493
TRAVIS: What?

01:15:19.493 --> 01:15:20.552
SAM: We all are.

01:15:20.552 --> 01:15:21.774
TRAVIS: What are you talking about?

01:15:21.774 --> 01:15:24.940
SAM: Didn't I tell you guys? There's a war
starting tomorrow?

01:15:24.940 --> 01:15:26.007
TRAVIS: Did you?

01:15:26.007 --> 01:15:27.781
SAM: I overheard them. Yes!

01:15:27.781 --> 01:15:29.273
LAURA: She did tell us.

01:15:29.273 --> 01:15:32.191
SAM: We're all going to die. We should leave now.

01:15:32.191 --> 01:15:34.562
LAURA: We're not going to die. The war is very far
away from us.

01:15:34.562 --> 01:15:38.772
TALIESIN: I can't believe I find myself agreeing
with Nott here. We should get out of town while

01:15:38.772 --> 01:15:40.179
it's still possible.

01:15:40.179 --> 01:15:43.124
TRAVIS: Really? We're just starting to climb our
way up through this thing.

01:15:43.124 --> 01:15:48.988
TALIESIN: You leave the table when you've got the
pot. You don't wait for everything to go back to

01:15:48.988 --> 01:15:49.964
the dealer.

01:15:49.964 --> 01:15:54.599
LIAM: I think for a day or two, everyone here is
going to be very preoccupied in the city. If there

01:15:54.599 --> 01:15:58.388
is anything you are thinking of doing, it would be
a good time to do it.

01:15:58.388 --> 01:16:00.321
LAURA: We should steal everything.

01:16:00.321 --> 01:16:03.672
TALIESIN: At some point, they're going to start
looking for people to fight this war, and I'm not

01:16:03.672 --> 01:16:06.616
sure I want to be around for it, because boy they
know who we are now.

01:16:06.616 --> 01:16:10.653
LIAM: What I am suggesting is a compromise. Not
leaving immediately, but soon.

01:16:10.653 --> 01:16:14.049
LAURA: I need time to go back to the Pillow Trove,
you guys.

01:16:14.049 --> 01:16:16.822
LIAM: DM, can you remind me what time of day it
is?

01:16:16.822 --> 01:16:21.010
MATT: It's past dusk now. At this point, nine
o'clock in the evening.

01:16:21.010 --> 01:16:24.900
LIAM: On past days, has Pumat's place been open
this late?

01:16:24.900 --> 01:16:26.376
MATT: It has been.

01:16:26.376 --> 01:16:31.016
TALIESIN: I still have a giant tapestry over my
shoulder.

01:16:31.016 --> 01:16:35.500
LAURA: I like to think you did the entire fight
with it.

01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:37.217
TALIESIN: I put it down before the fight.

01:16:37.217 --> 01:16:41.669
TRAVIS: Anyone else pick up on those two
individuals over in the corner?

01:16:41.669 --> 01:16:44.571
LAURA: Well, he pointed them out, we should go
talk to them.

01:16:44.571 --> 01:16:46.070
MARISHA: They look familiar.

01:16:46.070 --> 01:16:47.665
LAURA: What should we say?

01:16:47.665 --> 01:16:52.437
ASHLEY: Do you want me to do the talking?

01:16:52.437 --> 01:16:53.757
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Yes.

01:16:53.757 --> 01:16:55.246
ASHLEY: I was kidding.

01:16:55.246 --> 01:17:01.992
SAM: No, you should. You weren't with us the night
that all this went down, so they would not suspect

01:17:01.992 --> 01:17:03.098
you of anything.

01:17:03.098 --> 01:17:05.348
LAURA: That's actually true.

01:17:05.348 --> 01:17:07.679
TRAVIS: Outside your boundaries, here you go.
Let's go.

01:17:07.679 --> 01:17:11.045
ASHLEY: Fjord, can you come-- We're all going to
go, right?

01:17:11.045 --> 01:17:15.601
TRAVIS: Sure. Yeah. I'll join you. Jester?

01:17:15.601 --> 01:17:17.826
LAURA: You want me to come, too?

01:17:17.826 --> 01:17:22.540
TALIESIN: I actually think maybe it should be her
and Beau, because they won't recognize her, and

01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:26.060
human faces tend to blend into the crowd, whereas
we do not.

01:17:26.060 --> 01:17:28.621
LAURA: I can listen to the Starosta.

01:17:28.621 --> 01:17:30.211
TRAVIS: Fair enough.

01:17:30.211 --> 01:17:36.179
LIAM: I am already hanging out by the door to this
place. I left 30 seconds ago.

01:17:36.179 --> 01:17:38.983
ASHLEY: Wait, but I was actually kidding.

01:17:38.983 --> 01:17:40.312
TALIESIN: I'm not.

01:17:40.312 --> 01:17:42.155
LAURA: You'll be great, Yasha.

01:17:42.155 --> 01:17:48.645
SAM: Just ask them about what happened the other
night and the Crick that they killed.

01:17:48.645 --> 01:17:53.588
TALIESIN: Remember how we talked about getting you
out in the world more, and then you said you

01:17:53.588 --> 01:17:56.046
didn't want to, but then we said you're going to
have to do it anyway?

01:17:56.046 --> 01:17:57.621
ASHLEY: I know, but--

01:17:57.621 --> 01:17:58.867
TALIESIN: This is those times.

01:17:58.867 --> 01:18:00.374
ASHLEY: (sighs) Okay.

01:18:00.374 --> 01:18:03.562
MARISHA: Come on, let's go make asses out of
ourselves!

01:18:03.562 --> 01:18:04.863
TALIESIN: She'll take care of you.

01:18:04.863 --> 01:18:10.652
LAURA: Ask about the Xhorhasian that they fought
and then ask them how they do so much cool magic.

01:18:10.652 --> 01:18:13.127
Then ask them--

01:18:13.127 --> 01:18:19.224
SAM: Who they work for? We know who they work for.
What do we need from them?

01:18:19.224 --> 01:18:21.075
MARISHA: Names. Information.

01:18:21.075 --> 01:18:22.597
TRAVIS: What are they worried about?

01:18:22.597 --> 01:18:26.181
MARISHA: Where are they going to fight? Are they
going to roll out people?

01:18:26.181 --> 01:18:28.086
LAURA: Ask them how they fly.

01:18:28.086 --> 01:18:30.673
SAM: Oh! Why don't you just act like you know more
than you do? Like, (gruff voice) Whoa, I hear

01:18:30.673 --> 01:18:33.048
war's coming tomorrow. What about that?

01:18:33.048 --> 01:18:37.030
TRAVIS: If we're going to help the city, the more
we know, the better.

01:18:37.030 --> 01:18:41.488
TALIESIN: Let's not even start making vague
promises. Just be yourself and you'll

01:18:41.676 --> 01:18:45.564
be fine. Just be anybody but yourself
and you'll be fine. It's going to be great.

01:18:45.564 --> 01:18:48.511
MARISHA: What was that about making promises?

01:18:48.511 --> 01:18:51.116
TRAVIS: As they start walking over, I'm going to
wide flank to the left--

01:18:51.116 --> 01:18:53.139
MATT: Wait, so who's going where?

01:18:53.139 --> 01:18:56.164
MARISHA: Me and Yasha are going to go talk to the
wizards.

01:18:56.164 --> 01:18:57.679
MATT: Beau and Yasha are going there?

01:18:57.679 --> 01:18:58.811
LAURA: You're not going to go too?

01:18:58.811 --> 01:19:00.850
TRAVIS: No, these two.

01:19:00.850 --> 01:19:09.633
LAURA: Oh jeez. I'm going to constantly stay
within a few feet of the Starosta, but not in like

01:19:09.633 --> 01:19:14.637
a weird way. I just want to like overhear his
conversations and see if he's talking about war

01:19:14.743 --> 01:19:15.705
and stuff.

01:19:15.705 --> 01:19:20.404
TRAVIS: I'd like to flank to the left and keep an
eye on the crowd to see if anybody pays attention

01:19:20.404 --> 01:19:22.213
to two strangers approaching.

01:19:22.395 --> 01:19:27.134
MATT: Okay. It seems that the cluster of merchants
that he had originally mentioned are keeping

01:19:27.134 --> 01:19:32.456
pretty close to the Starosta. They're probably in
the business of discussing future transactions and

01:19:32.456 --> 01:19:38.988
business. You gather probably more on the Starosta
making connections in preparation for what's about

01:19:38.988 --> 01:19:40.222
to transpire.

01:19:40.222 --> 01:19:41.913
LIAM: Is it really crowded in here? Are there a
lot of people?

01:19:41.913 --> 01:19:46.561
MATT: There's about 20 or so people in the
chamber. The chamber's maybe about 40 feet by 40

01:19:46.706 --> 01:19:48.266
feet. It's fairly packed.

01:19:48.266 --> 01:19:58.206
LIAM: I am going to send Frumpkin dancing around
people's feet to follow Yasha and Beau, and take a

01:19:58.206 --> 01:20:01.155
seat in a chair on the side of the room as close
to the door as possible.

01:20:01.155 --> 01:20:03.793
MATT: You find a chair, everyone seems to be
standing and conversing.

01:20:03.793 --> 01:20:06.840
MARISHA: It's okay. Fjord's been teaching me how
to talk to people.

01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:11.093
ASHLEY: Do you want to take the lead?

01:20:11.093 --> 01:20:16.411
MARISHA: Sure. I walk up to Orenid Hass. Oremid.

01:20:16.411 --> 01:20:21.596
MATT: They're both faced away and they're looking
out. There's a window that's open that leads out

01:20:21.596 --> 01:20:26.382
into the main Victory Pit and then there's the
sky, which is mostly clouds, occasionally you see

01:20:26.382 --> 01:20:30.655
a break with some stars. They're in the middle of
a conversation, but it's hushed.

01:20:30.655 --> 01:20:37.186
MARISHA: I grab Yasha behind on the small of her
back. I walk her up to the window, and I'm like:

01:20:37.186 --> 01:20:39.801
Yeah, and there's actually a really great view--

01:20:39.801 --> 01:20:43.356
MATT: They both immediately stop and turn over to
look at you.

01:20:43.356 --> 01:20:47.172
ASHLEY: I can't even imagine the beauty.

01:20:47.172 --> 01:20:52.205
MARISHA: Right? It's such a great view. Over there
is the Cobalt Soul.

01:20:52.205 --> 01:20:56.752
MATT: "Pardon me, can we help you?" You glance
over, and you can see Oremid Hass, at first

01:20:56.752 --> 01:21:06.951
glance: squat, maybe five-foot-three, but a wide
body, like Wolverine proportions. Very dark, ruddy

01:21:06.951 --> 01:21:13.642
brown skin with eyes that are black like obsidian
that sparkle when you look at them. The hair is

01:21:13.642 --> 01:21:21.677
very short and curled, and there's this very
strongly inset dimple wrinkle when he smiles with

01:21:21.677 --> 01:21:27.431
teeth that are dull gray in color. There's
something not quite human about him, but also very

01:21:27.431 --> 01:21:34.607
welcoming. As he turns towards you, there's a bit
of dust that is loosened from the edges of his

01:21:34.607 --> 01:21:45.081
ears, and it (air puffing). It's a strange
phenomenon. With long reddish-gold robes, his arms

01:21:45.081 --> 01:21:51.119
are folded in the sleeves where you can't see
them. He says, "I apologize, we've taken time away

01:21:51.119 --> 01:21:55.979
"from the window." The other gentleman turns
towards you, and you can see now, very close, an

01:21:55.979 --> 01:22:05.266
older gentleman, probably 70s or so, skin slightly
jaundiced or yellowed in color versus the usual

01:22:05.266 --> 01:22:13.329
pigmentation here. Bald on top, but longer
gray-white hair that goes past the shoulders, the

01:22:13.329 --> 01:22:20.448
same white and gold robes. He smiles, but he looks
like he's not enjoying the pleasantries of the

01:22:20.448 --> 01:22:27.983
space, but then puts on a face as soon as he
notices your arrival and gives a nod. "I recognize

01:22:27.983 --> 01:22:32.550
"both of you. You were part of this fight ordeal,
The Mighty Nein, correct?"

01:22:32.550 --> 01:22:38.729
MARISHA: We were. I recognize you, too. I feel
like we've met before. Maybe at a gala

01:22:38.729 --> 01:22:40.379
previously?

01:22:40.379 --> 01:22:45.831
MATT: "It's possible. I do not recall, but if so,
it is good to see you again. I'm sorry."

01:22:45.831 --> 01:22:46.949
MARISHA: Beau.

01:22:46.949 --> 01:22:54.056
MATT: "Beau, I am Oremid Hass. I am the Headmaster
of the Halls of Erudition. This is my compatriot,

01:22:54.056 --> 01:22:55.765
"Master Trent Ikithon."

01:22:55.765 --> 01:22:57.944
MARISHA: Trent Ikithon.

01:22:57.944 --> 01:23:05.317
MATT: He turns and goes, "It is a pleasure to meet
you. I saw what you did today as well. It was a

01:23:05.317 --> 01:23:08.743
"very majestic display of skills, quite."

01:23:08.743 --> 01:23:10.976
ASHLEY: Thank you very much.

01:23:10.976 --> 01:23:21.583
MARISHA: Majestic is my middle name. We saw, the
other day, you guys fighting off those invaders,

01:23:21.583 --> 01:23:25.017
that was very impressive. Thank you so much for
your service to the city.

01:23:25.017 --> 01:23:32.002
MATT: Oremid goes to raise his hand and Trent
goes, "Oh, so you were present during the attack

01:23:32.002 --> 01:23:33.942
"outside of the Zauber Spire, <i>ja</i>?"

01:23:33.942 --> 01:23:38.066
MARISHA: Well, I mean, it was pretty public.
Towers are tall.

01:23:38.066 --> 01:23:46.204
MATT: "Well, it was an unfortunate incident that,
thankfully, we were present, both of us, to take

01:23:46.204 --> 01:23:47.781
"care of it before it grew too dangerous."

01:23:47.781 --> 01:23:49.320
ASHLEY: What were you fighting?

01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:58.689
MATT: "That seemed to be assassins sent by the
Kryn dynasty, terrible Cricks that had attempted to

01:23:58.689 --> 01:24:02.220
"steal something that should not fall into their
hands."

01:24:02.220 --> 01:24:09.219
ASHLEY: The Kryn dynasty, they are from northern
Xhorhas?

01:24:09.219 --> 01:24:16.741
MATT: "That is correct." He gives you a look over,
like he's inspecting you with a very rapid and

01:24:16.741 --> 01:24:23.912
very detailed intake of your features, and he
goes, "Where are you from, if I might ask?"

01:24:23.912 --> 01:24:26.510
SAM: Abort, abort, abort.

01:24:26.510 --> 01:24:31.437
ASHLEY: I am... from...

01:24:31.437 --> 01:24:33.701
MATT: "Where did you grow up?"

01:24:33.701 --> 01:24:35.688
ASHLEY: Xhorhas.

01:24:35.688 --> 01:24:39.143
MATT: "How long have you lived here in the
Empire?"

01:24:39.143 --> 01:24:58.020
ASHLEY: Not very long. About, let's see, maybe
eight months or something?

01:24:58.020 --> 01:24:59.826
MARISHA: That doesn't look good. No.

01:24:59.826 --> 01:25:02.120
MATT: "Fascinating."

01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:05.924
MARISHA: She travels and has helped--

01:25:05.924 --> 01:25:08.951
MATT: Trent isn't even looking at you. He's
completely focused on Yasha.

01:25:08.951 --> 01:25:15.737
ASHLEY: I travel. I left. (stammers) I chose not
to live there anymore.

01:25:15.737 --> 01:25:17.745
MATT: "Why did you leave?"

01:25:17.745 --> 01:25:31.451
ASHLEY: I just, you know, it's not a great place
to live. It's awful. It's marsh and it's not a

01:25:31.545 --> 01:25:33.295
comfortable place to live.

01:25:33.295 --> 01:25:36.600
MATT: Make a wisdom saving throw for me real
fast.

01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:37.884
ALL: Ooh.

01:25:37.884 --> 01:25:40.244
LAURA: Wisdom saving throw? He just did Zone of
Truth on you!

01:25:40.244 --> 01:25:44.457
TALIESIN: Wow, that was cocked.

01:25:44.457 --> 01:25:45.649
LAURA: Super cocked.

01:25:45.649 --> 01:25:46.910
SAM: Super cock!

01:25:46.910 --> 01:25:54.650
ASHLEY: Seven. Because I have a negative.

01:25:54.650 --> 01:26:00.387
MATT: As you're talking, it's weird. He's staring
at you, but for a moment you feel like there's an

01:26:00.387 --> 01:26:04.460
illusion over his mouth and his fingers. They're
still not moving, but it's almost like your eyes

01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:09.204
catch something shifting unseen beneath them. It's
almost like you've layered two images over each

01:26:09.204 --> 01:26:16.695
other for a brief second. Then they're gone, and
he goes, "Huh. Well, very happy to have you

01:26:16.695 --> 01:26:18.444
"fighting on our side."

01:26:18.444 --> 01:26:34.338
ASHLEY: Yes, I most definitely am. I can assure
you I don't stand for anything bad from the

01:26:34.338 --> 01:26:38.189
Xhorhas and I am here to help.

01:26:38.189 --> 01:26:42.917
MATT: "Wonderful. Maintain that, please."

01:26:42.917 --> 01:26:44.350
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:26:44.350 --> 01:26:51.093
MATT: "You and your friends seem to be very
helpful, and a lot of help may be needed. Should

01:26:51.093 --> 01:26:59.648
"you ever stray from that path... It has been a
pleasure, Yasha."

01:26:59.683 --> 01:27:01.476
ASHLEY: Yes, that's me.

01:27:01.476 --> 01:27:05.524
MATT: He reaches out and shakes your hand once
more. "I would like very much to talk to you some

01:27:05.524 --> 01:27:08.578
"time in the future. You're intriguing."

01:27:08.578 --> 01:27:14.818
MARISHA: Well, you see, you have to go through me,
because I'm her booker. That's actually a

01:27:14.818 --> 01:27:20.101
conversation that me and you and the rest of The
Mighty Nein can have.

01:27:20.101 --> 01:27:24.987
MATT: "You're Cobalt Soul, aren't you?" Oremid
goes, "Please, stop this interrogation. I

01:27:24.987 --> 01:27:27.962
"apologize. My friend is very studious."

01:27:27.962 --> 01:27:33.305
MARISHA: No, I am Cobalt Soul. Yeah. Super proud
of the work we're doing over there.

01:27:33.305 --> 01:27:37.724
MATT: "You have done much great work and have
aided us on many occasions."

01:27:37.724 --> 01:27:42.750
MARISHA: Everyone at the Cobalt Soul feels the
same about you all at the Halls of Erudition.

01:27:42.750 --> 01:27:58.236
MATT: Oremid Hass actually laughs and he goes,
(laughs) "Look. I know that there have been

01:27:58.236 --> 01:28:04.638
"tensions in the past, but, complete honesty, I
really appreciate what you do over there."

01:28:04.638 --> 01:28:05.911
MARISHA: Thank you.

01:28:05.911 --> 01:28:12.401
MATT: "Anyway, we must be off. The evening has
grown late. Isn't that correct?" Trent goes, "Yes,

01:28:12.401 --> 01:28:18.104
"that is correct. It's been a pleasure. I look
forward to our paths crossing again."

01:28:18.104 --> 01:28:25.785
ASHLEY: Great. Same here, because this was great
conversation.

01:28:25.785 --> 01:28:34.827
MARISHA: One last question, Oremid. The Cobalt
Soul's been talking about moving to the front

01:28:34.827 --> 01:28:39.614
line. Do you have any idea if we're going to get
the same support from the Hall of Erudition?

01:28:39.614 --> 01:28:46.642
Because I know you're a fan of our work and we're
such a mutual fan of yours.

01:28:46.642 --> 01:28:48.526
MATT: "To the front line of what?"

01:28:48.526 --> 01:28:52.312
ASHLEY: Ah, you know.

01:28:52.312 --> 01:29:01.359
MATT: "We train a good number of war mages, yes.
Some of our finest will be present at Bladegarden

01:29:01.359 --> 01:29:08.809
"and beyond. Should things escalate any further,
I'm sure a number of our circle will also join

01:29:08.809 --> 01:29:10.210
"where it's necessary."

01:29:10.210 --> 01:29:12.369
MARISHA: Beautiful.

01:29:12.369 --> 01:29:14.575
MATT: "You have my word and the word of the
Assembly."

01:29:14.575 --> 01:29:18.431
MARISHA: Cobalt Soul's got your back too.

01:29:18.431 --> 01:29:27.818
ASHLEY: But to be clear, do you know what you're
fighting?

01:29:27.818 --> 01:29:34.839
MATT: They both have a knowing look at each other
and look back to you. Trent casts forward and

01:29:34.839 --> 01:29:39.614
says, "We have been studying for quite some time
as is the nature of protecting our people here,

01:29:39.614 --> 01:29:44.770
"yes, but there are still many mysteries beyond the
boundaries. Why? Is there something you know that

01:29:44.770 --> 01:29:46.325
"we don't?"

01:29:46.325 --> 01:29:52.933
ASHLEY: Just if you're fighting-- I just wanted to
know if you were fighting the Kryn.

01:29:52.933 --> 01:30:01.557
MATT: "Very much so. They have killed many of our
people. The skies to the east darken, and we want

01:30:01.557 --> 01:30:06.758
"to keep that darkness from spreading. We wish the
sun to continue to rise on this empire, and

01:30:06.758 --> 01:30:10.367
"currently it does not over the Ashkeeper Peaks."

01:30:10.367 --> 01:30:14.149
ASHLEY: I wish you the best of luck.

01:30:14.149 --> 01:30:19.989
MATT: "Thank you. If you're ever near Rexxentrum,
find me. I would like to continue this

01:30:19.989 --> 01:30:21.470
"conversation."

01:30:21.470 --> 01:30:22.643
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:30:22.643 --> 01:30:28.341
MATT: Oremid Hass speaks up and goes, "All right.
Well, anyway, a wonderful night to you all. Rest

01:30:28.341 --> 01:30:31.556
"well. Congratulations and well fought."

01:30:31.556 --> 01:30:35.995
TRAVIS: DM, can I ask, is his name
Trick-a-tick-a-ting-tong? What was his name?

01:30:35.995 --> 01:30:41.360
MATT: Trent Ikithon. I-K-I-T-H-O-N.

01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:43.177
LAURA: Oh, I spelled it right!

01:30:43.177 --> 01:30:45.880
MATT: You're welcome.

01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:47.892
SAM: I ran a half-ikithon once.

01:30:47.892 --> 01:30:50.833
TRAVIS: Boo!

01:30:50.833 --> 01:30:53.939
ASHLEY: Where did he say we could meet up?

01:30:53.939 --> 01:30:55.103
TRAVIS: Rexxentrum.

01:30:55.103 --> 01:30:56.196
ASHLEY: Rexxentrum?

01:30:56.196 --> 01:30:57.356
MATT: Rexxentrum, yeah.

01:30:57.356 --> 01:30:58.661
TRAVIS: Which is where the Soltryce is.

01:30:58.661 --> 01:31:03.746
MARISHA: Rexxentrum. Soltryce Academy.

01:31:03.746 --> 01:31:08.791
MATT: They exit, and you watch as Oremid, halfway
through the room, as he has his arms folded, goes,

01:31:08.919 --> 01:31:13.859
"Oh my goodness. Look at you!" and gets down and
starts going towards Frumpkin and is like, "Well,

01:31:13.859 --> 01:31:17.369
"how did you get in here?"

01:31:17.369 --> 01:31:18.828
MARISHA: Oh my god, he's got a weakness.

01:31:18.828 --> 01:31:20.375
MATT: He begins reaching for--

01:31:20.375 --> 01:31:21.674
LIAM: Hass or Ikithon?

01:31:21.674 --> 01:31:28.436
MATT: No. Oremid Hass immediately goes down and
goes from this completely well-established

01:31:28.436 --> 01:31:35.294
presentary persona to this child-like wonder of
this cat. He's like, "Come here.

01:31:35.363 --> 01:31:37.164
"Please. I would like to touch on you."

01:31:37.164 --> 01:31:39.009
LIAM: I'm taking all this in first person.

01:31:39.009 --> 01:31:39.980
MATT: Yep.

01:31:39.980 --> 01:31:41.807
MARISHA: Let's remember this for later.

01:31:41.807 --> 01:31:44.649
TRAVIS: My whiskers!

01:31:44.649 --> 01:31:47.317
LIAM: That's all I can take. I get out of it.

01:31:47.317 --> 01:31:55.466
MATT: Okay. You pull out of it, and you watch as
Oremid actually picks up Frumpkin and holds him in

01:31:55.466 --> 01:32:00.891
his hand and starts petting him like (coos). They
both continue to walk towards the exit.

01:32:00.891 --> 01:32:09.283
LIAM: I lean forward and look at the ground.

01:32:09.283 --> 01:32:16.093
MATT: Okay. As they exit the chamber, Oremid,
outside, goes ahead and sets Frumpkin down and

01:32:16.093 --> 01:32:23.856
pets his head for a moment. "Go on. Don't get
stuck inside." They both leave and exit into the night.

01:32:23.856 --> 01:32:27.325
TALIESIN: That looked like it went well. How bad
was it?

01:32:27.325 --> 01:32:29.682
SAM: What information did you glean?

01:32:29.682 --> 01:32:31.398
MARISHA: Man, Yasha's super honest.

01:32:31.398 --> 01:32:33.213
SAM: Why? What happened?

01:32:33.213 --> 01:32:34.386
MARISHA: Super forthcoming.

01:32:34.386 --> 01:32:41.573
ASHLEY: I figured it's like one of those things,
that if you're going to get caught, you might as

01:32:41.573 --> 01:32:48.582
well tell the truth because it's easier to
remember. I don't know. I panicked.

01:32:48.582 --> 01:32:51.408
TRAVIS: Well, did you say anything you didn't want
to?

01:32:51.408 --> 01:32:55.951
ASHLEY: I don't think so. Did I say anything that
was bad?

01:32:55.951 --> 01:32:57.336
MARISHA: I don't think so.

01:32:57.336 --> 01:33:00.828
LIAM: Maybe where you are from and how short a
time you have been here.

01:33:00.828 --> 01:33:03.077
ASHLEY: Oh, I said both of those things.

01:33:03.077 --> 01:33:04.292
TALIESIN: You said both of those things?

01:33:04.292 --> 01:33:05.409
LIAM: Yes, you did.

01:33:05.409 --> 01:33:10.023
MARISHA: You definitely made it seem like she
could be a Xhorhasian spy definitely there to

01:33:10.023 --> 01:33:13.062
potentially kill them. In fact, I think that's
exactly what they thought might have been

01:33:13.062 --> 01:33:14.129
happening.

01:33:14.129 --> 01:33:17.062
LIAM: Yeah, but you also dropped a horse apple in
front of them as well.

01:33:17.062 --> 01:33:18.270
MARISHA: Yeah, it was kind of great.

01:33:18.270 --> 01:33:19.315
TRAVIS: What'd she do?

01:33:19.315 --> 01:33:25.042
LIAM: She mentioned a little insight on the
pending war when no one knows about the pending war.

01:33:25.042 --> 01:33:32.965
MARISHA: I think they're going to look at you as a
good resource. I think that's what you revealed

01:33:32.965 --> 01:33:34.267
yourself as.

01:33:34.267 --> 01:33:40.837
ASHLEY: Either that, or they think that I'm a
Xhorhasian assassin, and I am not.

01:33:40.837 --> 01:33:43.830
MARISHA: What the fuck is the Kryn though?

01:33:43.830 --> 01:33:48.785
SAM: The Kryn is the kingdom over there.

01:33:48.785 --> 01:33:49.933
TRAVIS: Kryn.

01:33:49.933 --> 01:33:51.138
ASHLEY: It's the Kryn dynasty.

01:33:51.138 --> 01:33:52.672
MARISHA: Oh, the Kryn.

01:33:52.672 --> 01:33:55.335
LAURA: Kryn is the empress of the drow, you guys.

01:33:55.335 --> 01:33:57.276
TRAVIS: The green is something else.

01:33:57.276 --> 01:33:59.579
LAURA: I'm not here. I'm next to Starosta.

01:33:59.579 --> 01:34:02.292
TALIESIN: It didn't devolve into a punching fest.
That's pretty good.

01:34:02.292 --> 01:34:03.877
LAURA: Is the Starosta still here?

01:34:03.877 --> 01:34:04.889
MATT: The Starosta is still here, yes.

01:34:04.889 --> 01:34:06.553
LAURA: Okay, I'm still there.

01:34:06.553 --> 01:34:09.904
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:34:09.904 --> 01:34:14.304
MARISHA: I was envisioning a big, evil monster.

01:34:14.304 --> 01:34:15.886
LAURA: 20.

01:34:15.886 --> 01:34:20.822
MATT: Okay. You overhear the gist of most of the
conversation, best you can without catching too

01:34:20.822 --> 01:34:26.432
much attention to yourself. Over the next 20
minutes or so, you catch what amounts to them

01:34:26.432 --> 01:34:32.985
discussing possible future difficulty in crossing
border boundaries between the empire, the

01:34:32.985 --> 01:34:38.768
Menagerie Coast, and imports. The necessity of
them, but having to make sure they go through very

01:34:38.768 --> 01:34:43.308
stringent processes in doing so, with the promise
of coming conflict. He doesn't outright say that

01:34:43.308 --> 01:34:48.820
they're at war yet, but the Starosta is
essentially laying the groundwork for maintaining

01:34:48.820 --> 01:34:55.960
trade lines through the Wuyun Gorge, across the
Cyrios Mountains. Wanting to make sure that the

01:34:55.960 --> 01:35:00.954
port towns of the Menagerie Coast still have
access to get the necessary goods to the empire,

01:35:00.954 --> 01:35:05.531
not only to maintain their people, but to get them
as quickly as possible to the front to the east.

01:35:05.531 --> 01:35:07.250
TRAVIS: Right, allies.

01:35:07.250 --> 01:35:10.995
MATT: Yeah, they're trying to basically
establish-- what initially seemed like it may have

01:35:10.995 --> 01:35:15.813
been a pleasantry based arrival on their part,
they have been pulled into this conversation with

01:35:15.813 --> 01:35:19.131
the Starosta out of necessity from his standpoint.
You can sense there's a bit of desperation in his

01:35:19.131 --> 01:35:23.582
voice. He's generally trying to do the best job he
can and feels overwhelmed in the moment and is

01:35:23.582 --> 01:35:25.333
trying as best he can to cover it.

01:35:25.333 --> 01:35:41.965
SAM: Yasha. Just so we know and can-- I trust you.
But if there's anything that we need to know, now

01:35:41.965 --> 01:35:47.580
would be a good time to tell us so that we're not
in danger. Are you a Xhorhasian spy come here to

01:35:47.580 --> 01:35:49.385
do bad things to the empire?

01:35:49.385 --> 01:35:50.670
ASHLEY: No.

01:35:50.670 --> 01:35:57.173
TALIESIN: Oh my god, you've discovered why she's
been with my circus all this time, working as a

01:35:57.173 --> 01:35:58.174
bouncer.

01:35:58.174 --> 01:36:01.688
SAM: Well, why are you here then? Why did you
flee?

01:36:01.688 --> 01:36:09.803
ASHLEY: Well, I don't know if that is any of your
business at this time.

01:36:09.803 --> 01:36:14.645
SAM: Well, I want to know in case they're going to
come try to kill you and kill me by accident.

01:36:14.645 --> 01:36:18.734
TALIESIN: If they try and kill you to get answers,
then, this way, you don't know anything. Then

01:36:18.734 --> 01:36:20.424
you're really not worth anything.

01:36:20.424 --> 01:36:21.906
TRAVIS: Plausible deniability.

01:36:21.906 --> 01:36:24.387
SAM: Plausi-mon-a-mon-a-minity?

01:36:24.387 --> 01:36:26.426
TRAVIS: There was an M in there that wasn't
supposed to be.

01:36:26.426 --> 01:36:30.431
Plausible demi-ability.

01:36:30.431 --> 01:36:34.285
LIAM and TALIESIN: Sea anemone. Sea anemone.

01:36:34.285 --> 01:36:44.066
SAM: I just want to know if you're on their side
or the Xhorhasian side so that when this war

01:36:44.066 --> 01:36:46.957
comes, that we're not caught in the crossfire.
That's all.

01:36:46.957 --> 01:36:48.248
TALIESIN: What side are you on?

01:36:48.248 --> 01:36:50.178
SAM: I'm on my side.

01:36:50.178 --> 01:36:51.168
TALIESIN: Exactly.

01:36:51.168 --> 01:37:00.655
ASHLEY: I'm not on any side, but I do think what
we are fighting is something very terrible.

01:37:00.655 --> 01:37:02.314
SAM: You mean what <i>they're</i> fighting?

01:37:02.314 --> 01:37:05.041
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:37:05.041 --> 01:37:06.103
SAM: In Xhorhas?

01:37:06.103 --> 01:37:07.413
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:37:07.413 --> 01:37:08.715
SAM: The Kryn?

01:37:08.715 --> 01:37:25.997
ASHLEY: Yeah. I mean, we heard about them in the
north and they're mostly dark elves that settled

01:37:25.997 --> 01:37:33.294
in a massive ruin that was completely forbidden
for us to travel to.

01:37:33.294 --> 01:37:38.072
SAM: Did they do bad things to your people?

01:37:38.072 --> 01:37:52.653
ASHLEY: Yeah. The ones that went there. They do
keep their skies dark. It's some kind of dark

01:37:52.653 --> 01:38:05.399
magic that we don't know of that keeps the sun
away. They've enslaved men and beasts and demons

01:38:05.399 --> 01:38:06.832
under their banner.

01:38:06.832 --> 01:38:09.820
SAM: That sucks.

01:38:09.820 --> 01:38:12.361
MARISHA: Have you seen the dark skies?

01:38:12.361 --> 01:38:21.681
ASHLEY: I've never been there because it's hard to
get there and it's not someplace I would want to

01:38:21.681 --> 01:38:23.064
go alone.

01:38:23.064 --> 01:38:26.153
SAM: Did you know anyone who went?

01:38:26.153 --> 01:38:31.071
ASHLEY: I've heard stories, but never anybody
personally.

01:38:31.071 --> 01:38:34.638
TRAVIS: Are you interested in going there?

01:38:34.638 --> 01:38:46.608
ASHLEY: I've always been curious. Just to see with
my own eyes, but they've done so many bad things

01:38:46.608 --> 01:38:50.939
that I would want to fight them.

01:38:50.939 --> 01:38:57.706
MARISHA: I think Molly's right. I think Molly and
Nott are right. I think they're going to try and

01:38:57.706 --> 01:39:00.821
start enlisting soldiers here. Are they doing the
same where you're from?

01:39:00.821 --> 01:39:03.373
ASHLEY: I don't know.

01:39:03.373 --> 01:39:09.402
LIAM: During this whole talking, I look in and see
where my cat is.

01:39:09.402 --> 01:39:16.733
MATT: Frumpkin is maybe 20 feet outside the door
and is waiting for you guys to exit.

01:39:16.733 --> 01:39:19.746
LIAM: Okay. I tell him to wait there for me.

01:39:19.746 --> 01:39:20.956
MATT: Okay.

01:39:20.956 --> 01:39:27.412
TRAVIS: If we're really going to be pulling out of
this city that fast, haha. Maybe we should take

01:39:27.412 --> 01:39:31.713
advantage of these new badges we have and hit up
the Tri-Spires.

01:39:31.713 --> 01:39:37.280
TALIESIN: Finish the evening off right. I'll
honestly say I'd like to get out of here as soon

01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:42.234
as possible so they don't think we're running from
the news. We get out of here before the news hits.

01:39:42.234 --> 01:39:44.934
TRAVIS: Fair enough. All at once?

01:39:44.934 --> 01:39:46.436
MARISHA: Where do we go?

01:39:46.436 --> 01:39:50.854
TALIESIN: I don't care. I'm just happier moving
than staying still.

01:39:50.854 --> 01:39:52.671
LIAM: How quickly are you thinking?

01:39:52.671 --> 01:39:57.281
TALIESIN: If it were just the two of us, I'd say
leave tonight, but--

01:39:57.281 --> 01:39:59.195
LIAM: How about 24 hours from now?

01:39:59.195 --> 01:40:07.292
TALIESIN: See if we can make it faster, but 24
hours is not terrifying.

01:40:07.292 --> 01:40:09.697
TRAVIS: Dusk tomorrow.

01:40:09.697 --> 01:40:14.129
TALIESIN: No later than dusk. I would like to get
out before news starts to spread. Before they

01:40:14.129 --> 01:40:16.302
decide to start locking down the holes.

01:40:16.302 --> 01:40:22.688
LIAM: Yeah. One more day. Just to get supplies and
get ready for the road again.

01:40:22.688 --> 01:40:24.258
TALIESIN: That's a fair point.

01:40:24.258 --> 01:40:26.171
SAM: Should we divide up the money?

01:40:26.171 --> 01:40:28.041
MARISHA: Yes!

01:40:28.041 --> 01:40:31.545
TRAVIS: I believe that's 228 gold each.

01:40:32.117 --> 01:40:32.903
SAM: Great!

01:40:32.903 --> 01:40:35.534
MATT: As you guys are in the process of finishing
this up and people are starting to leave from the

01:40:35.534 --> 01:40:39.592
lounge area and they're starting to close down,
Darrow comes up with his troupe-- they're a ways

01:40:39.592 --> 01:40:46.864
into their cups-- and he's like, "Friends, before
we shove off and probably never meet again, I just

01:40:46.864 --> 01:40:50.812
"wanted to say it's been an absolute pleasure to
get to meet you, to watch you fight, for you to

01:40:50.812 --> 01:40:54.304
"watch us fight. All the luck in your future
endeavors."

01:40:54.304 --> 01:41:00.095
TRAVIS: Same to you. It was very impressive. Where
does fate take you after this night?

01:41:00.095 --> 01:41:04.339
MATT: "Well, as far as I know, we're probably
heading back up to Nogvurot and continuing with

01:41:04.339 --> 01:41:06.848
"our contract of sitting around and being paid for
nothing."

01:41:06.848 --> 01:41:10.288
TRAVIS: Is that-- remind me again-- north of here?
Northwest?

01:41:10.288 --> 01:41:15.189
MATT: "Northeast-ish. East of Rexxentrum. That's
where we've been stationed for the past six or

01:41:15.189 --> 01:41:18.883
"seven months or so. Done a few jobs here and
there."

01:41:18.883 --> 01:41:22.875
TRAVIS: Is this a contract that keeps on going or
is there any set end date for you guys?

01:41:22.875 --> 01:41:24.521
MATT: "No, not until they cancel it."

01:41:24.521 --> 01:41:30.230
TRAVIS: Man, that is rough. We've been hearing
little murmurs of action-- what direction is it?

01:41:30.230 --> 01:41:31.433
SAM: East.

01:41:31.433 --> 01:41:32.623
TRAVIS: East of here.

01:41:32.623 --> 01:41:35.482
MATT: "Like over on the border with Xhorhas?"

01:41:35.482 --> 01:41:37.991
TRAVIS: Indeed. Trouble stirring up. You hear
anything about that?

01:41:37.991 --> 01:41:42.904
MATT: "Other than the fact that there have been
incursions and kidnappings and stuff, it's all

01:41:42.904 --> 01:41:48.577
"been small and localized within the borders, but
Bladegarden's there for a reason, and

01:41:48.577 --> 01:41:49.966
"Talonstadt."

01:41:49.966 --> 01:41:53.684
TRAVIS: Since you're familiar with that trip back
and forth, anything you would recommend us

01:41:53.684 --> 01:41:57.125
checking out? Just in case we decided to wander
for a bit?

01:41:57.125 --> 01:41:59.746
MATT: "(laughter) What are you looking for?"

01:41:59.746 --> 01:42:02.906
TRAVIS: I don't know, a good time, a bit of
adventure. Maybe a bit of both.

01:42:02.906 --> 01:42:11.864
MATT: "Hm, a good time. To be perfectly honest, if
you're looking for wining, dining, and various

01:42:11.864 --> 01:42:19.434
"nightly pleasures, my faith does not allow for
that so I'm a very bad source, but," and he turns

01:42:19.434 --> 01:42:20.525
around--

01:42:20.525 --> 01:42:23.858
LIAM: I think what my friend is talking about is
can you recommend any good ways to get into

01:42:23.858 --> 01:42:24.982
trouble?

01:42:24.982 --> 01:42:28.830
MATT: "Oh. Legal trouble, or illegal trouble?"

01:42:28.830 --> 01:42:31.468
LIAM: What you will.

01:42:31.468 --> 01:42:35.445
MATT: "If you're going to go illegal, you can
actually go just beyond the boundaries of the

01:42:35.445 --> 01:42:40.959
"Empire to Shadycreek Run. Entire haven for
murderers, thieves, and all sorts of strange

01:42:40.959 --> 01:42:42.131
"people."

01:42:42.131 --> 01:42:45.509
TRAVIS: Maybe if it's not so gnarly?

01:42:45.509 --> 01:42:53.484
MATT: "There is Deastok to the west, as well as
Kamordah. There's quite good drink in Kamordah.

01:42:53.484 --> 01:43:02.727
"There's Pride's Call if you like the jovial
dwarvenfolk there. Much less dark and intense as

01:43:02.727 --> 01:43:07.394
"Grimgolir, because they're right on the boundary
and most of them are fighting for the war as well.

01:43:07.502 --> 01:43:11.070
"Personally, Rexxentrum's got it all."

01:43:11.070 --> 01:43:16.369
TRAVIS: We hear that. Soltryce Academy is located
there as well.

01:43:16.369 --> 01:43:19.632
MATT: "Yeah, that it is."

01:43:19.632 --> 01:43:24.406
TRAVIS: Do you know anybody that's graduated from
that academy?

01:43:24.406 --> 01:43:29.440
MATT: "Not privately, no. Like I said, I've only
been here for about a little over a half a year.

01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:33.802
"To me, it's not been too bad."

01:43:33.802 --> 01:43:36.584
TRAVIS: Fair enough. Well, I wish you the best.

01:43:36.584 --> 01:43:40.797
MATT: "You as well, my friends. Drink deep. Play
hard."

01:43:40.797 --> 01:43:42.736
TRAVIS: Indeed. Same to you.

01:43:42.736 --> 01:43:48.107
LAURA: I'd like to stop the Starosta before he
leaves the room.

01:43:48.107 --> 01:43:53.545
MATT: Okay. You do notice, as Darrow leaves, he
does have a medallion around his neck that,

01:43:53.545 --> 01:43:57.212
previously, was hidden under his armor. It is the
symbol of the Dawnfather.

01:43:57.212 --> 01:44:03.919
LAURA: It's the legal thing, after-- oh no, it's
not!

01:44:03.919 --> 01:44:05.508
MATT: The Dawnfather's legal here.

01:44:05.508 --> 01:44:07.045
LAURA: The Dawnfather is legal here.

01:44:07.045 --> 01:44:14.259
MATT: As the rest of the folk are exiting out, you
guys have basically waited to close down the

01:44:14.259 --> 01:44:18.986
party. Most of the servants are cleaning up and
finishing up the space. The Starosta begins to

01:44:18.986 --> 01:44:21.504
leave and make his way out there with his
companions and they're chatting.

01:44:21.504 --> 01:44:24.807
MARISHA: I drink all the leftover drinks that
people left behind.

01:44:24.807 --> 01:44:27.934
MATT: Classiest. Classy.

01:44:27.934 --> 01:44:30.843
SAM: I have limitless alcohol.

01:44:30.843 --> 01:44:33.277
LAURA: May I have a moment of your time before you
leave?

01:44:33.277 --> 01:44:39.057
MATT: "Oh yeah, of course! Jester-- " No, you told
him it was Fancypants.

01:44:39.057 --> 01:44:40.446
LAURA: Fancypants, yes.

01:44:40.446 --> 01:44:41.666
TRAVIS: McGee.

01:44:41.666 --> 01:44:42.886
MATT: "Fancypants McGee."

01:44:42.886 --> 01:44:43.999
LAURA: Yes.

01:44:43.999 --> 01:44:45.374
MATT: "Right, right. Yes-- "

01:44:45.374 --> 01:44:47.514
LAURA: My friends call me Jester.

01:44:47.514 --> 01:44:50.566
MATT: "Fair enough. What can I do for you?"

01:44:50.566 --> 01:44:56.979
LAURA: Well, I couldn't help but notice your body
posture, for this <i>whole</i> party, has been rather

01:44:56.979 --> 01:45:06.285
tense. I don't know if you noticed, but I am a bit
of a healer, and I'm from the Menagerie Coast,

01:45:06.285 --> 01:45:14.241
where I did a lot of mental healing, as well as
body healing. If there's anything you need to

01:45:14.241 --> 01:45:18.402
relieve your stress, I'm very good at this. This
is why I came here.

01:45:18.402 --> 01:45:27.106
MATT: He gives a look and goes, "Uh," and looks
back and forth between his companions. He goes,

01:45:27.106 --> 01:45:29.095
"What are you insinuating?"

01:45:29.095 --> 01:45:32.160
LAURA: I'm talking about somebody to talk to.

01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:34.110
MATT: "Right! Right."

01:45:34.110 --> 01:45:36.286
LAURA: To relieve your mind of your stress!

01:45:36.286 --> 01:45:46.643
MATT: "Right. I really appreciate that offer.
Genuinely, Jester Fancypants McGee. However, such

01:45:46.643 --> 01:45:47.634
"is my life-- "

01:45:47.634 --> 01:45:49.583
LAURA: I know you have people that work for you--

01:45:49.583 --> 01:45:57.345
MATT: "Maybe in a week. Give me some time. A lot of
stuff percolating right now, but Leaky Tap, right?"

01:45:57.488 --> 01:45:59.199
LAURA: Or the Pillow Trove.

01:45:59.199 --> 01:46:05.464
MATT: "Or the Pillow Trove. All right, well I may
have use of your services soon. Not at the moment,

01:46:05.464 --> 01:46:06.666
"but soon."

01:46:06.666 --> 01:46:13.068
LAURA: Okay. I can help your mind! You just
relieve that stress! It's somebody to talk to,

01:46:13.068 --> 01:46:14.388
it's very helpful.

01:46:14.388 --> 01:46:20.598
MATT: "I appreciate that. Soon." He is trying
desperately to not make the wrong impression to

01:46:20.598 --> 01:46:23.689
his friends. He darts off with them into the
night.

01:46:23.689 --> 01:46:28.359
TALIESIN: Are you drinking every random cup or are
you pouring them all into one cup?

01:46:28.359 --> 01:46:29.910
TRAVIS: Suicide or one at a time?

01:46:29.910 --> 01:46:36.604
MARISHA: No, I'm just finishing the ones that are
left behind! It is an atrocity to leave alcohol on

01:46:36.604 --> 01:46:37.946
a table.

01:46:37.946 --> 01:46:39.427
MATT: Make a constitution saving throw, Beau.

01:46:39.427 --> 01:46:42.057
TRAVIS: Yeah! One of those was full of dip spit.

01:46:42.057 --> 01:46:44.419
LIAM: Fjord's work.

01:46:44.419 --> 01:46:50.421
MARISHA: 17.

01:46:50.421 --> 01:46:52.698
MATT: Iron stomach Beauregard over here.

01:46:52.698 --> 01:46:55.700
LAURA: You're going to have the shits later.

01:46:55.700 --> 01:46:57.076
MARISHA: Probably.

01:46:57.076 --> 01:47:03.781
TALIESIN: You're a trash person. I walk over and I
take your last drink and drink it and salute.

01:47:03.781 --> 01:47:08.645
MARISHA: You're a-- You--

01:47:08.645 --> 01:47:10.294
TALIESIN: I know!

01:47:10.294 --> 01:47:14.003
LAURA: Oh man, you guys, I was really trying to
get the Starosta to talk to me.

01:47:14.003 --> 01:47:19.532
SAM: Well, you offered him your services. I
would've said yes if a strange psychoanalyst

01:47:19.532 --> 01:47:20.392
walked up to me and--

01:47:20.392 --> 01:47:24.512
LAURA: I am a healer! I'm a really good healer.

01:47:24.512 --> 01:47:27.582
TRAVIS: Did you tell him that he has to give you a
dollar to engage your services?

01:47:27.582 --> 01:47:31.162
LAURA: No, I told him-- I didn't give him a price,
actually.

01:47:31.162 --> 01:47:32.930
MARISHA: See, that's even shiftier.

01:47:32.930 --> 01:47:37.686
LAURA: That means I'm really good, is what that
means.

01:47:37.686 --> 01:47:39.657
ASHLEY: You charge for these services?

01:47:39.657 --> 01:47:40.962
LAURA: Not for friends.

01:47:40.962 --> 01:47:41.958
ASHLEY: Oh.

01:47:41.958 --> 01:47:46.377
LAURA: (whispering) I'm actually really shit at
giving advice, but don't tell anyone, okay?

01:47:46.377 --> 01:47:49.437
ASHLEY: I don't agree. I feel like you would be
very good at it.

01:47:49.437 --> 01:47:56.207
LAURA: Well, any time you have any problems,
Yasha, you just come to me, okay?

01:47:56.207 --> 01:48:01.605
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm maybe showing a little bit of pink
on my cheeks.

01:48:01.605 --> 01:48:08.366
LIAM: Are we talking about rolling at the Pillow
Trove this evening? Is that what I am picking up on?

01:48:08.366 --> 01:48:12.298
LAURA: I need to go by there anyway. How long has
it been since we've been in town?

01:48:12.298 --> 01:48:18.534
MATT: Since you've been in town? It's probably
been a week and a half to two weeks.

01:48:18.534 --> 01:48:22.405
LAURA: By this point, my mom has probably got the
package here.

01:48:22.405 --> 01:48:27.571
TRAVIS: Well, by all means, let's stop by there
and then let's see if there's a fancy place for us to--

01:48:27.571 --> 01:48:29.417
MARISHA: We have fucking money to burn!

01:48:29.417 --> 01:48:31.849
SAM: We need some healing potions and things.

01:48:31.849 --> 01:48:33.223
LAURA: Yes. I bet there's places in--

01:48:33.223 --> 01:48:34.796
TRAVIS: We'll go by Pumat's later. It'll be fine.

01:48:34.796 --> 01:48:36.754
LAURA: We could go to the Silken Terrace!

01:48:36.754 --> 01:48:38.227
SAM: What is the Silken Terrace?

01:48:38.227 --> 01:48:39.268
MATT: At this point now--

01:48:39.268 --> 01:48:40.444
LIAM: Seven, eight, nine?

01:48:40.444 --> 01:48:41.994
MATT: Oh, no, now it's probably about 10:30, 11
o'clock.

01:48:41.994 --> 01:48:45.618
TRAVIS: Plus, there's always one of those Pumats
around.

01:48:45.618 --> 01:48:49.190
SAM: Okay. What's the mission for tonight,
though?

01:48:49.209 --> 01:48:54.652
TRAVIS: Tri-Spire. Pillow Trove. Get Jester's
package. Get turnt up. Get some healing potions.

01:48:54.761 --> 01:48:57.560
LIAM: Wait, we're getting turnt up before we go to
Pumat's?

01:48:57.560 --> 01:48:58.610
LAURA: Why not?

01:48:58.610 --> 01:48:59.500
TRAVIS: Yeah!

01:48:59.500 --> 01:49:01.280
LIAM: Do you think Pumat is going to be open at two
in the morning?

01:49:01.280 --> 01:49:05.405
TRAVIS: At Ren Faire, the more you drink, the more
you spend.

01:49:05.405 --> 01:49:07.387
LAURA: Why do we need to go now?

01:49:07.387 --> 01:49:08.788
LIAM: We don't.

01:49:08.788 --> 01:49:10.013
LAURA: It's late.

01:49:10.013 --> 01:49:10.921
LIAM: Yes.

01:49:10.921 --> 01:49:15.151
TALIESIN and LAURA: We did a lot today.

01:49:15.151 --> 01:49:16.732
MARISHA: Oh my god, I'm so tired!

01:49:16.732 --> 01:49:21.675
LAURA: That's probably because you just drank 15
drinks.

01:49:21.675 --> 01:49:25.925
TRAVIS: Lead the way, Jester!

01:49:25.925 --> 01:49:27.289
TALIESIN: Up early in the morning?

01:49:27.289 --> 01:49:31.034
LAURA: Up early in the m-- Are we staying at the
Pillow Trove?

01:49:31.034 --> 01:49:32.191
MARISHA: Pillow Trove!

01:49:32.191 --> 01:49:33.197
TALIESIN: Yes!

01:49:33.197 --> 01:49:36.276
LAURA: Did you guys divide the money up?

01:49:36.276 --> 01:49:37.403
TALIESIN and SAM: Yes.

01:49:37.403 --> 01:49:38.442
LAURA: What did I get?

01:49:38.442 --> 01:49:39.573
TALIESIN and SAM: 228.

01:49:39.573 --> 01:49:40.919
SAM: And five silver.

01:49:40.919 --> 01:49:48.619
MATT: All right. You exit from the forum, the
Victory Pit, out into the night. The event is

01:49:48.619 --> 01:49:54.862
still going on though most of the people have filtered out.
Everyone who remains is either pretty tossed or is in the

01:49:54.905 --> 01:50:00.842
process of closing down their various carts and
established places of sale. The Pentamarket is

01:50:00.965 --> 01:50:06.636
closing. The festival pushed it a little for some
establishments. You make your way, walking towards

01:50:06.636 --> 01:50:09.188
the Tri-Spires, and that's we're going to take our
break.

01:50:09.188 --> 01:50:12.594
MARISHA: We're at a break!

01:50:12.648 --> 01:50:15.105
MATT: Yeah, we're taking a break because it's 8:50.

01:50:15.240 --> 01:50:16.411
SAM: It's still your birthday!

01:50:16.411 --> 01:50:18.234
(cheering)

01:50:18.234 --> 01:50:23.762
MATT: We'll be right back. However, we do have our
Wyrmwood giveaway. Tonight, we have the quilted

01:50:23.762 --> 01:50:30.898
maple dice tray. With our leather interior.

01:50:30.898 --> 01:50:33.234
LAURA: Yeah, that's really cool!

01:50:33.234 --> 01:50:40.159
MATT: You may touch it. Not only do you win it,
but you win it touched by Laura Bailey. The price

01:50:40.202 --> 01:50:45.569
just went up by 20%. The quilted
maple one will go to one of you lucky winners in

01:50:45.601 --> 01:50:53.206
the US or Canada, excluding Quebec. Come into the
Twitch chat. Tonight's term is "Victory." Put in

01:50:53.206 --> 01:50:57.838
the word "Victory" in the chat to be entered, only
once. More than once and you'll be disqualified.

01:50:57.838 --> 01:51:01.769
We'll come back at the end of the break to
announce the winner. See you guys there in a

01:51:01.769 --> 01:51:03.202
little bit.

01:51:03.202 --> 02:07:18.611
[break]

02:07:18.611 --> 02:07:22.171
MATT: And welcome back, everybody. Before we jump
back into the game, we have our winner of our

02:07:22.171 --> 02:07:26.772
fantastic dice box from Wyrmwood: it is
DeadLikeCarrion. DeadLikeCarrion, congratulations.

02:07:26.772 --> 02:07:32.430
Danoba will get your information, we will get that
sent out to you A.S.A.P., but well done.

02:07:32.430 --> 02:07:35.518
MARISHA: And thank you, Paul, for getting us all
ice cream!

02:07:35.518 --> 02:07:44.137
MATT: Yes! We had break ice cream. Nobody tell my
trainer.

02:07:44.137 --> 02:07:48.092
LAURA: I had the fro-yo, because it's healthier.

02:07:48.092 --> 02:07:56.207
MATT: You guys are leaving the Pentamarket in the
late hours of the evening, making your way towards

02:07:56.207 --> 02:08:06.267
the Tri-Spires. As you approach the outskirts of
the outer wall, the gates open, the guards there

02:08:06.267 --> 02:08:11.643
posted, there are three there waiting. They begin
to approach as your troupe begins to arrive. One

02:08:11.643 --> 02:08:22.166
of them steps up, goes, "Halt please, we've-- Oh,
right, please, you may continue."

02:08:22.295 --> 02:08:23.607
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're them.

02:08:23.607 --> 02:08:28.152
LIAM: Very obviously holding and petting my cat
and looking at all three of them as we walk by.

02:08:28.152 --> 02:08:32.660
MATT: One of them is the guy that kicked him
originally. He's not the one that interfaced with

02:08:32.660 --> 02:08:35.655
you, but he's standing by the side there, just
waiting. He watches you approach as you walk by,

02:08:35.655 --> 02:08:37.561
and he goes--

02:08:37.561 --> 02:08:40.459
LIAM: <i>Guten abend.</i>

02:08:40.459 --> 02:08:46.622
MATT: He swallows and doesn't respond. Just looks
off in the distance.

02:08:46.622 --> 02:08:51.954
ASHLEY: Caleb, what did you say? <i>Guten</i>--

02:08:51.954 --> 02:08:53.307
LIAM: <i>Abend.</i>

02:08:53.307 --> 02:08:55.122
LAURA: Good night? Hello?

02:08:55.122 --> 02:08:56.189
LIAM: Yeah, that's--

02:08:56.189 --> 02:08:57.306
TALIESIN: Gluten almonds.

02:08:57.306 --> 02:08:58.361
LAURA: Have a pleasant evening.

02:08:58.361 --> 02:09:00.382
MARISHA and ASHLEY: Gluten almonds.

02:09:00.382 --> 02:09:02.160
TRAVIS: Where are we going?

02:09:02.160 --> 02:09:07.152
SAM: I mean, we're going to the Pillow Trove. I
support you, Jester, but I mean--

02:09:07.152 --> 02:09:10.469
LAURA: I support you too in all of your endeavors,
Nott.

02:09:10.469 --> 02:09:12.074
SAM: Okay, then let's go there.

02:09:12.074 --> 02:09:16.091
MATT: As you guys make your way through the
streets of the Tri-Spire--

02:09:16.091 --> 02:09:29.210
LIAM: Excuse me, apologies. I pull Beau backward
by the arm. And-- no. Long enough until we fall

02:09:29.210 --> 02:09:32.591
back a bit, and wait to see that the group is not
paying attention.

02:09:32.591 --> 02:09:33.846
MATT: Okay.

02:09:33.846 --> 02:09:39.661
LIAM: Can you get me into that library tomorrow?

02:09:39.661 --> 02:09:48.477
MARISHA: Yeah. I told you a fucking secret though.
I also kind of told Yasha the secret. You and

02:09:48.477 --> 02:09:49.976
Yasha know the secret.

02:09:49.976 --> 02:09:51.584
LIAM: Okay.

02:09:51.584 --> 02:09:53.555
MARISHA: It's not really that much of a secret.

02:09:53.555 --> 02:09:59.122
LIAM: Okay, but the library is a thing that we can
do before we leave this city?

02:09:59.122 --> 02:10:04.603
MARISHA: Yeah. As long as nothing crazy happens,
I'm assuming.

02:10:04.603 --> 02:10:09.383
LIAM: I am just hoping to look at books. Is that
all right?

02:10:09.383 --> 02:10:13.837
MARISHA: I know. I know exactly what you want to
do. Yeah, should be all right.

02:10:13.837 --> 02:10:16.007
LIAM: Good. Great.

02:10:16.007 --> 02:10:20.133
MARISHA: What are you looking for, just more
spells? Or anything else in particular?

02:10:20.133 --> 02:10:31.914
LIAM: No, I mean, spells you can find, you know,
digging in 1000 year old laboratories. I want to

02:10:31.914 --> 02:10:39.423
learn. I want what is not readily available to
all.

02:10:39.423 --> 02:10:40.835
MARISHA: Okay.

02:10:40.835 --> 02:10:46.381
LIAM: I don't know if that is something that I
would be allowed to look at. What kind of

02:10:46.381 --> 02:10:48.323
clearance do you have?

02:10:48.323 --> 02:10:52.864
MARISHA: They're not going to let you see the
super secretive weird shit in the back.

02:10:52.864 --> 02:10:54.152
LIAM: History?

02:10:54.152 --> 02:10:58.504
MARISHA: Yeah, there's tons of history, man. They
forced history down my throat.

02:10:58.504 --> 02:11:02.503
LIAM: Okay, this is good.

02:11:02.503 --> 02:11:04.337
MARISHA: Hey, wait though.

02:11:04.337 --> 02:11:07.322
LIAM: Oh, that's two times I've tried to bail out
of this conversation.

02:11:07.322 --> 02:11:13.701
MARISHA: I know. Real good at it. Why are you
afraid of fire?

02:11:13.701 --> 02:11:17.509
TRAVIS: Great segue.

02:11:17.509 --> 02:11:22.449
LIAM: Uh. Well.

02:11:22.449 --> 02:11:26.000
MARISHA: I'm just saying, I just want to know
because I'm going to be taking you around books,

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:29.553
and your relationship with fire is, you know.

02:11:29.553 --> 02:11:31.479
LIAM: Are you going to set the books on fire?

02:11:31.479 --> 02:11:33.084
MARISHA: No, are you going to set the books on
fire?

02:11:33.084 --> 02:11:34.589
LIAM: I'm going to read them.

02:11:34.589 --> 02:11:42.030
MARISHA: I'll take you in the library if you tell
me why you're afraid of fire.

02:11:42.030 --> 02:11:45.082
SAM: (whispering) Oh, manipulation!

02:11:45.082 --> 02:11:53.360
MARISHA: One secret traded for another. It's a
fair price, I think.

02:11:53.360 --> 02:11:59.108
LIAM: Is there anyone around?

02:11:59.108 --> 02:12:03.400
MATT: There's the group ahead of you, maybe 15
feet, and you're approaching the exterior of the

02:12:03.400 --> 02:12:04.936
Pillow Trove.

02:12:04.936 --> 02:12:07.209
LAURA: I'm giving Yasha a piggy-back ride.

02:12:07.209 --> 02:12:10.859
MARISHA: Do you know where to find me when you're
ready?

02:12:10.859 --> 02:12:12.523
MATT: Do you consent to this piggy-back ride?

02:12:12.523 --> 02:12:15.393
ASHLEY: Yeah, I have my feet linked so I can
monkey piggy-back ride.

02:12:15.393 --> 02:12:24.263
MATT: That's amazing. There's the Zauber Spire,
glistening and lit from beneath. Assembled, and no

02:12:24.263 --> 02:12:30.803
longer akimbo. You guys approach the exterior of
the Pillow Trove. There's these steps that ascend

02:12:30.803 --> 02:12:35.902
to the entryway, the arched door frame, and you
enter the beautiful--

02:12:35.902 --> 02:12:40.173
MARISHA: I'll take you to the library as soon as I
get my payment. Drinks?

02:12:40.173 --> 02:12:43.707
SAM: We're out in public, and we're in front of a
hotel.

02:12:43.707 --> 02:12:46.901
MARISHA: Inside the hotel has drinks.

02:12:46.901 --> 02:12:53.849
LAURA: I like that you have a handle on your mug,
but you don't use the handle.

02:12:53.849 --> 02:12:59.827
MARISHA: Well, it's a little unbalanced. I have to
choose if I'm going to commit to the handle, or if

02:12:59.827 --> 02:13:01.115
I'm going to commit to the cup.

02:13:01.115 --> 02:13:02.487
LAURA: Maybe do the thing you just did.

02:13:02.487 --> 02:13:03.890
MARISHA: This is not bad.

02:13:03.890 --> 02:13:08.179
LIAM: But the handle gets-- I do the same thing
with this cup. I grab it by this the whole time.

02:13:08.179 --> 02:13:10.782
MATT: As you make your way into the--

02:13:10.782 --> 02:13:12.449
LIAM: How do you do it, Sam?

02:13:12.449 --> 02:13:21.003
MATT: The Pillow Trove, in its beautiful marvel
presentation there awaits you as you come into the

02:13:21.003 --> 02:13:29.191
well-lit interior. There's a number of candles
that are hanging on small hooks in the walls, and

02:13:29.191 --> 02:13:35.653
dangle there, and the flames flicker to light the
archway, and the inside. There you see, sitting at

02:13:35.653 --> 02:13:45.929
the table, going through a stack of parchment, is
Madam Luenna, who you had briefly seen before in

02:13:45.929 --> 02:13:47.755
this beautiful red dress.

02:13:47.755 --> 02:13:53.144
LAURA: She's gorgeous. Hey, that lady, that's who
I was trying to look like that night, you

02:13:53.144 --> 02:13:55.646
remember, when we were at the-- yeah.

02:13:55.646 --> 02:13:56.673
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:13:56.673 --> 02:14:04.853
MATT: Well kept, almost bouncy brunette hair, and
golden eyes, and she smiles as you enter. "Hello,

02:14:04.853 --> 02:14:06.844
"how might I help you this evening?"

02:14:06.844 --> 02:14:08.885
LAURA: Hi, do you remember me? I was here before.

02:14:08.885 --> 02:14:11.303
MATT: "I do remember, yes. Good to see you."

02:14:11.303 --> 02:14:13.947
LAURA: You too. Did you know we just won in the
Victory Pit?

02:14:13.947 --> 02:14:18.171
MATT: "I did not. I did not attend that portion of
the festival, but congratulations!"

02:14:18.171 --> 02:14:19.760
LAURA: Thank you, we're kind of famous now.

02:14:19.760 --> 02:14:20.996
MATT: "That's wonderful."

02:14:20.996 --> 02:14:27.283
LAURA: We think we might stay here tonight, too,
because we thought it would be nice for The Pillow

02:14:27.283 --> 02:14:29.462
Trove to have famous people staying here for you.

02:14:29.462 --> 02:14:33.911
MATT: "But of course. Is that a room for each of
you?"

02:14:33.911 --> 02:14:36.372
MARISHA: She's an Instagram model!

02:14:36.372 --> 02:14:42.094
LAURA: It depends on what you want to offer us as
the Victories of the Victory Pit.

02:14:42.094 --> 02:14:49.220
MATT: "Well, I'm happy to offer you rooms at the
discounted rate of the charging price we give to

02:14:49.220 --> 02:14:51.133
"it. It's still an establishment."

02:14:51.133 --> 02:14:56.147
LAURA: Oh, yes, but we would tell everybody we
stayed here all the time.

02:14:56.147 --> 02:15:02.245
MATT: "Well, it doesn't work that way, my dear."

02:15:02.245 --> 02:15:07.878
LAURA: I'm really bad at persuading people today,
apparently.

02:15:07.878 --> 02:15:09.273
SAM: Do you want me to try?

02:15:09.273 --> 02:15:14.568
LAURA: I'm doing a really bad job. I have a
package probably here anyway, so I'm going to

02:15:14.568 --> 02:15:20.583
check on that. I'll let everybody else talk to you
about how famous we are now.

02:15:20.583 --> 02:15:25.228
MATT: "All right. How many rooms would you like?"

02:15:25.228 --> 02:15:27.638
TRAVIS: I think two will do just fine.

02:15:27.638 --> 02:15:29.644
MATT: "Two rooms. All right."

02:15:29.644 --> 02:15:32.019
MARISHA: However many can bunk together, I guess.

02:15:32.019 --> 02:15:41.071
MATT: Okay. Two rooms, purchased for the night.
If I recall correctly, that would put you around four gold.

02:15:41.071 --> 02:15:49.929
LAURA: That's it?! Four gold! Do you know how much
she wanted to charge me before? I'm going to leave

02:15:50.037 --> 02:15:52.855
it though, because I am walking away. I'm at the
front desk.

02:15:52.855 --> 02:15:54.881
ASHLEY: Four gold for two rooms?

02:15:54.881 --> 02:15:56.105
MATT: For each room.

02:15:56.105 --> 02:15:59.855
TRAVIS: I'll cover the fellas' room. Here's four
gold.

02:15:59.855 --> 02:16:03.396
MARISHA: Yeah. Here's four more for me.

02:16:03.396 --> 02:16:17.760
MATT: This was her ceding to the Victory Pit
victory and return customer price. Jester, what

02:16:17.760 --> 02:16:19.041
are you doing?

02:16:19.041 --> 02:16:21.181
LAURA: I'm going to see if my package is here from
my mom.

02:16:21.181 --> 02:16:24.989
MATT: Okay, so you head to where you went
previously, which is a little side chamber.

02:16:24.989 --> 02:16:31.667
There's a young woman there waiting, who is
falling asleep at the desk. "Oh, I'm sorry! I

02:16:31.667 --> 02:16:34.360
"didn't see you there. Can I help you?"

02:16:34.360 --> 02:16:37.933
LAURA: I blend in with my environment very often.
It's common.

02:16:37.933 --> 02:16:40.116
MATT: "Oh. Well, very well done."

02:16:40.116 --> 02:16:43.052
LAURA: I have a package here, probably.

02:16:43.052 --> 02:16:44.822
MATT: "Name?"

02:16:44.822 --> 02:16:45.918
LAURA: Jester.

02:16:45.918 --> 02:16:56.775
MATT: "Jester. Hold on just a second." She gets up
and walks out of the room. A minute passes. Two

02:16:56.775 --> 02:16:58.934
minutes pass.

02:16:58.934 --> 02:17:00.656
TRAVIS: Anything on the desk of value?

02:17:00.656 --> 02:17:10.905
MATT: On the desk of this woman who has left?
There looks to be a small oil lantern set there

02:17:10.905 --> 02:17:12.500
that's flickering. It's well-made.

02:17:12.500 --> 02:17:13.768
TRAVIS: Nice pen or anything?

02:17:13.768 --> 02:17:15.816
MATT: No, it looks like she took it with her.

02:17:15.816 --> 02:17:18.328
TRAVIS: I keep waiting.

02:17:18.328 --> 02:17:29.564
MATT: About five minutes pass before she enters
with a small parcel under her arm, and goes, "I

02:17:29.564 --> 02:17:34.785
"believe this is to you, Jester, correct?" It's a
small box about that big, it says "Jester" written

02:17:34.785 --> 02:17:36.747
in nice handwriting on it.

02:17:36.747 --> 02:17:39.543
LAURA: Oh yes, that would be the one I'm
expecting. Thank you so much!

02:17:39.543 --> 02:17:42.385
SAM: It came?

02:17:42.385 --> 02:17:46.325
LAURA: It came, I guess! See, I told you my mom is
really cool, you guys!

02:17:46.325 --> 02:17:47.787
SAM: I'm sorry I doubted you!

02:17:47.787 --> 02:17:48.800
LAURA: Oh my gosh!

02:17:48.800 --> 02:17:50.187
TALIESIN: We're all going to be here to see this
open, right?

02:17:50.187 --> 02:17:54.594
LAURA: (whispers) It's probably a lot of money, so
we should open it up in the rooms.

02:17:54.594 --> 02:17:57.070
TALIESIN: Very fair.

02:17:57.070 --> 02:17:59.972
TRAVIS: Thank you for your help. We'll retire for
the evening.

02:17:59.972 --> 02:18:01.877
SAM: Do we typically tip when someone--

02:18:01.877 --> 02:18:03.547
MATT: She does have her hand open.

02:18:03.547 --> 02:18:09.427
LAURA: Oh, here. Of course, of course! Here's two
gold for you.

02:18:09.427 --> 02:18:10.965
SAM: Two gold? Jesus!

02:18:10.965 --> 02:18:12.517
LAURA: I'm very wealthy now!

02:18:12.517 --> 02:18:16.818
MATT: Thank you very much, madam. Have a wonderful
night and stay here at The Pillow Trove.

02:18:16.818 --> 02:18:23.039
LAURA: Now we don't have to worry about things
anymore, you guys!

02:18:23.039 --> 02:18:30.279
MATT: As you guys head back, the keys are given
out to both of you. The madam leads you up to your

02:18:30.279 --> 02:18:34.756
chambers. On your way up, she goes, "Are there any
other services that you will require while you're

02:18:34.756 --> 02:18:36.570
"staying here this evening to celebrate?"

02:18:36.570 --> 02:18:38.995
SAM: What services are available?

02:18:38.995 --> 02:18:40.400
MATT: "All kinds of services."

02:18:40.400 --> 02:18:42.541
MARISHA: Bottle service?

02:18:42.541 --> 02:18:47.203
MATT: "Wine can be delivered. Companionship can be
provided."

02:18:47.203 --> 02:18:48.421
TRAVIS: Oh shit!

02:18:48.421 --> 02:18:49.552
TALIESIN: Massage?

02:18:49.552 --> 02:18:54.189
ASHLEY: What kind of companionship do you have
here available?

02:18:54.189 --> 02:19:04.968
MATT: "Ah, well--" You see her trying to find the
words for it. She goes, "Likely the best kind of

02:19:04.968 --> 02:19:06.552
"companionship you can find."

02:19:06.552 --> 02:19:07.902
LAURA: Not the best kind.

02:19:07.902 --> 02:19:09.418
SAM: The best available.

02:19:09.418 --> 02:19:15.182
TRAVIS: You don't happen to work with the Ruby of
the Sea, do you?

02:19:15.182 --> 02:19:24.959
MATT: "No, I know of her. She has a reputation.
But we have fine companions here as well, to--"

02:19:24.959 --> 02:19:27.001
LAURA: She has the best reputation, you know.

02:19:27.001 --> 02:19:36.063
MATT: "She has a <i>great</i> reputation, yes. But she
works outside of the Empire. Should you be

02:19:36.063 --> 02:19:43.177
"interested, we have a number of individuals across
the spectrum who would be happy to lend you an

02:19:43.177 --> 02:19:45.725
"ear, and help ease your mind."

02:19:45.725 --> 02:19:48.079
MARISHA: Jester does that too.

02:19:48.079 --> 02:19:50.657
LAURA: Hmm? Who does that?

02:19:50.657 --> 02:19:53.524
MARISHA: Lend an ear. Give advice. Ease your mind.

02:19:53.524 --> 02:19:55.930
LAURA: Oh, I do ease people's <i>minds</i>.

02:19:55.930 --> 02:19:58.289
MARISHA: Just saying that's how it sounded before,
too.

02:19:58.289 --> 02:20:05.224
SAM: Yasha, if you were to partake of a companion,
what kind of companion are you interested in? Is

02:20:05.224 --> 02:20:09.153
it like a beast type of a thing, or--

02:20:09.153 --> 02:20:11.213
LAURA: Like a tall one or a short one?

02:20:11.213 --> 02:20:16.692
ASHLEY: I don't know, just one that I-- maybe
lots?

02:20:16.692 --> 02:20:18.501
TRAVIS: <i>Maybe lots?</i>

02:20:18.501 --> 02:20:23.977
LAURA: What color eyes do you like the most? Do
you want people with one color eye and the other

02:20:23.977 --> 02:20:25.157
color eye, like you--

02:20:25.157 --> 02:20:28.286
MATT: "How about you come and find me when you've
decided whether or not?"

02:20:28.286 --> 02:20:31.655
MARISHA: Is there like a-- never mind.

02:20:31.655 --> 02:20:32.763
TRAVIS: Jester, shall we?

02:20:32.763 --> 02:20:33.907
LAURA: Yes, yes.

02:20:33.907 --> 02:20:35.071
MATT: The madam leaves.

02:20:35.071 --> 02:20:42.691
LIAM: Can I ask an out-of-character question? As a
citizen of the Empire, how much does Caleb already

02:20:42.691 --> 02:20:46.064
know about the Cobalt folk?

02:20:46.064 --> 02:20:54.662
MATT: The Cobalt Soul? You know of them, in the
way that you know of the people at City Hall that

02:20:54.662 --> 02:20:58.992
keep all the records of buildings and such. You
know it exists, everyone knows it's part of the

02:20:58.992 --> 02:21:03.372
structure, but nobody really pays much attention
because it's a place of learning beyond what the

02:21:03.372 --> 02:21:07.390
usual learning process is. Certain people would.

02:21:07.390 --> 02:21:09.189
MARISHA: Like the public libraries of today.

02:21:09.189 --> 02:21:10.782
LIAM: Right, you're a librarian.

02:21:10.782 --> 02:21:18.098
MATT: Kind of, yeah. People know it
exists, but the few people that really take an

02:21:18.332 --> 02:21:22.963
interest in it either end up pursuing it, or
adjacently to it. Those people end up acquiring

02:21:22.963 --> 02:21:28.808
more knowledge and end up becoming more prominent in
the society. It's almost an unused resource,

02:21:28.908 --> 02:21:30.745
unfortunately.

02:21:30.745 --> 02:21:36.419
LIAM: Their political affiliation?

02:21:36.419 --> 02:21:45.690
MATT: Within the Empire? They're one of the many
sanctioned places of worship for the Knowing

02:21:45.690 --> 02:21:52.983
Mistress. But they're with the Empire, they
function within the Empire, and the individuals

02:21:52.983 --> 02:22:03.627
that run each Archive are appointed by the Crown.
As with all places of worship in the kingdom,

02:22:03.627 --> 02:22:08.422
whoever helms those locations-- the High Priest,
the High Archivist, whoever they are-- they are

02:22:08.422 --> 02:22:13.917
appointed by the Crown and work directly for the
Empire. All religion here is employed by the

02:22:13.917 --> 02:22:15.861
Empire at the highest point.

02:22:15.861 --> 02:22:18.901
TALIESIN: So long as there's a Cobalt Soul
Scholastic Fair, really.

02:22:18.901 --> 02:22:22.580
LAURA: (gasps) Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark?

02:22:22.580 --> 02:22:25.161
MARISHA: Yes! I want my pencil set!

02:22:25.161 --> 02:22:28.335
MATT: That's after winter, unfortunately. You have
to wait until spring for those to come around

02:22:28.335 --> 02:22:30.543
again. God, I miss those.

02:22:30.543 --> 02:22:33.652
TRAVIS: Shit. Everybody got those gifts brought to
the room.

02:22:33.652 --> 02:22:38.210
MARISHA: It felt like a festival inside your
school.

02:22:38.210 --> 02:22:39.424
MATT: Yeah, it was amazing.

02:22:39.424 --> 02:22:40.704
LAURA: Do they still have those?

02:22:40.704 --> 02:22:43.125
ASHLEY: Let's make one for adults!

02:22:43.125 --> 02:22:47.453
MATT: Guys! Reading's cool! No, legitimately, it
is.

02:22:47.493 --> 02:22:50.208
MARISHA: Support 826LA! Thank you to those who
did.

02:22:50.208 --> 02:22:53.751
MATT: You head to your rooms at the Pillow Trove.

02:22:53.751 --> 02:23:02.333
LAURA: Okay, when we get the money, we should all
go out and buy new outfits, and we should go have

02:23:02.333 --> 02:23:06.804
a feast, and maybe we can buy new clothes for the
horses too, because I bet they would really like that.

02:23:06.804 --> 02:23:08.604
ASHLEY: But you don't need to give us money.

02:23:08.604 --> 02:23:16.223
LAURA: It's for everyone! I open up the box that
says my name right on it. It says it right here,

02:23:16.223 --> 02:23:17.601
my name.

02:23:17.601 --> 02:23:27.207
MATT: First off, the package, as you shake it a
bit, it has various objects inside of it. It

02:23:27.207 --> 02:23:28.568
rattles a bit.

02:23:28.568 --> 02:23:30.416
LAURA: It's not as heavy as I expected it to be.

02:23:30.416 --> 02:23:31.487
MATT: No.

02:23:31.487 --> 02:23:32.861
SAM: Maybe it's a check.

02:23:32.861 --> 02:23:36.435
LAURA: That's probably what it is. I have no idea
what that is.

02:23:36.435 --> 02:23:43.018
MATT: It's about eight to ten pounds. As you open
the package and unwrap it, it's pretty well

02:23:43.018 --> 02:23:49.541
wrapped, you open the parcel and on the inside
there is a bag of coin about that big there.

02:23:49.541 --> 02:23:51.573
LAURA: It's probably platinum, because it's
lighter.

02:23:51.573 --> 02:23:55.984
MATT: There is a small bundle that's wrapped with
twine, and there's a letter.

02:23:55.984 --> 02:24:03.603
LAURA: Ooh! (singing)

02:24:03.603 --> 02:24:05.079
SAM: Beautiful handwriting.

02:24:05.079 --> 02:24:12.522
LAURA: Yes. She's really amazing. Do you want me
to read it out loud?

02:24:12.522 --> 02:24:14.131
SAM: Yes, of course!

02:24:14.131 --> 02:24:22.300
LAURA: Okay, okay. "My darling Jester," that's me,
"I do so hope your journeys have been safe,

02:24:22.300 --> 02:24:28.745
"fruitful, and wondrous. I've always wished you to
see the beauty of the world around us, and while

02:24:28.745 --> 02:24:34.577
"the circumstances perhaps were not the most
favorable, it has allowed you the freedom to

02:24:34.577 --> 02:24:35.973
"become your own woman."

02:24:35.973 --> 02:24:37.224
SAM: That's nice!

02:24:37.224 --> 02:24:44.048
LAURA: I spent a lot of time inside, I told you
this, yes. Okay. "To show all of Wildemount and

02:24:44.065 --> 02:24:50.928
"beyond the gifts you have to offer, and the joys
you have to give. My sweet girl, how I miss you."

02:24:50.928 --> 02:24:58.341
I miss her too, so much! "Your laughter, your
energy, I've been sick in your absence." Oh,

02:24:58.341 --> 02:25:05.049
because I'm such a healer, you know, and I took
care of her, so that makes me so sad. "But it is

02:25:05.049 --> 02:25:11.218
"the trial any mother must endure, I suppose.
You're on your own now, and while I will always

02:25:11.218 --> 02:25:19.709
"miss that little girl, I'm equally eager to see
the woman you will become. Tensions here are less,

02:25:19.709 --> 02:25:26.908
"but not absent. Given time, I hope things will
vanish into the past, and you may come to see me

02:25:26.908 --> 02:25:34.723
"once more! Until then, I have included a small
trifle, some things to keep you comfortable,

02:25:34.723 --> 02:25:44.471
"creating, and free. I love you. Your Ruby," my
mama, "Marian Lavorre." She doesn't tell many

02:25:44.471 --> 02:25:46.108
people her real name, you know.

02:25:46.108 --> 02:25:48.043
SAM: Marian? That's a beautiful name.

02:25:48.043 --> 02:25:49.201
LAURA: Isn't it?

02:25:49.201 --> 02:25:50.376
TRAVIS: That's a nice letter.

02:25:50.376 --> 02:25:52.411
LAURA: I love my mom so much.

02:25:52.411 --> 02:25:54.545
ASHLEY: It looks like she loves you very much,
too.

02:25:54.545 --> 02:26:00.502
LAURA: Let's see what she sent us, okay? I open
the little package.

02:26:00.502 --> 02:26:08.257
MATT: Okay. The package contains a vial about that
big, filled with dark liquid. You shake it there.

02:26:08.257 --> 02:26:09.619
LAURA: Do I recognize it?

02:26:09.619 --> 02:26:15.048
MATT: You do. She keeps it, usually, by her
materials. It's a bottle of her lavender perfume.

02:26:15.048 --> 02:26:17.196
LAURA, SAM, and MARISHA: Ooh!

02:26:17.196 --> 02:26:18.410
SAM: Chanel!

02:26:18.410 --> 02:26:20.213
MARISHA: That's what I was going to say! Wow!

02:26:20.213 --> 02:26:23.784
LAURA: It smells really nice! Everybody really
likes this smell!

02:26:23.784 --> 02:26:29.126
MATT: It's a smell that's very much affiliated
with her, and as you smell it, a wave of nostalgia

02:26:29.126 --> 02:26:34.804
comes over you. Your childhood flashes through you
again. Within that bundle as well, you see there

02:26:34.804 --> 02:26:43.083
are five small ink vials of different colors.
There's a red ink, there's a blue ink, there's a

02:26:43.083 --> 02:26:45.687
green ink, and then two black.

02:26:45.687 --> 02:26:49.069
LAURA: Blue, green, yes!

02:26:49.069 --> 02:26:50.819
SAM: Color printer.

02:26:50.819 --> 02:26:53.293
MATT: Magenta, cyan. (laughs)

02:26:53.293 --> 02:27:01.320
LAURA: This is so I can keep painting. I used up a
lot of the paint that I had at the festival.

02:27:01.320 --> 02:27:03.562
TALIESIN: Hmm?

02:27:03.562 --> 02:27:05.762
MATT: And 200 gold in the pouch.

02:27:05.762 --> 02:27:07.833
LAURA: 200 gold?!

02:27:07.833 --> 02:27:12.406
SAM: That's a lot of money! For all of us.

02:27:12.406 --> 02:27:18.583
LAURA: That is a really good amount of money. 200
gold is a lot of money, you guys.

02:27:18.583 --> 02:27:21.105
TRAVIS: Are you expecting more?

02:27:21.105 --> 02:27:34.081
LAURA: Well, I mean, when we left, you know, I had
a lot more than that. But, you know, it's because

02:27:34.081 --> 02:27:43.555
I'm growing up, and we probably are learning about
how to spend money better, so she's teaching me,

02:27:43.555 --> 02:27:47.950
probably, that 5000 gold is not needed every
time.

02:27:47.950 --> 02:27:50.232
SAM: She gave you 5000 gold before?

02:27:50.232 --> 02:27:53.782
LAURA: (panicked exhale) I really thought there
was going to be more money in here.

02:27:53.782 --> 02:27:57.646
SAM: Did you tell her that you were out of money?

02:27:57.646 --> 02:27:59.513
LAURA: I did! I did tell her that!

02:27:59.513 --> 02:28:01.248
SAM: And this is all she sent?

02:28:01.248 --> 02:28:06.859
LAURA: But you know what, that's totally fine! 200
gold is really generous of her!

02:28:06.859 --> 02:28:12.630
SAM: Maybe. I don't know your mother, maybe she
was testing the postal system. Sending a small

02:28:12.630 --> 02:28:18.717
amount as a test. You can write back and say, "Got
it safely, feel free to send more."

02:28:18.717 --> 02:28:20.550
LAURA: That's a really good idea.

02:28:20.550 --> 02:28:24.941
SAM: Maybe that was it. Because I wouldn't want to
send 5000 gold over the mail system. There's

02:28:24.941 --> 02:28:28.501
people out there who <i>steal</i> the mail!

02:28:28.501 --> 02:28:38.061
TRAVIS: (laughter) Whoosh! (imitates dramatic
music)

02:28:38.061 --> 02:28:41.757
MARISHA: You made an incredibly excellent point.
It is so easy to defraud the mail.

02:28:41.757 --> 02:28:49.492
ASHLEY: Plus, 200 gold is a lot of money. That's
more than I pretty much have right now.

02:28:49.492 --> 02:28:51.198
LAURA: It is a lot of money!

02:28:51.198 --> 02:28:52.588
TALIESIN: It's more than we used to make in a
year, easily.

02:28:52.588 --> 02:28:54.210
MARISHA: It's a lot to send somebody in a birthday
card.

02:28:54.210 --> 02:28:55.676
LAURA: Caleb?

02:28:55.676 --> 02:28:57.606
LIAM: What?

02:28:57.606 --> 02:29:01.860
LAURA: I'm really sorry about that one time when
you were talking about money with me, okay?

02:29:01.860 --> 02:29:04.365
LIAM: Oh, that's fine.

02:29:04.365 --> 02:29:12.985
SAM: The most important thing is that she loves
and cares for you, and wants to support you from

02:29:12.985 --> 02:29:14.137
afar.

02:29:14.137 --> 02:29:19.645
LAURA: That is really great. She sent my favorite
colors. Red and blue and green and black. Those

02:29:19.645 --> 02:29:21.468
are my favorites to paint with!

02:29:21.468 --> 02:29:23.848
SAM: Those are the absolute most basic you can
have.

02:29:23.848 --> 02:29:28.928
LAURA: You can mix them. She knew I had a lot of
white already on me, so I can make lots of

02:29:28.928 --> 02:29:29.858
colors.

02:29:29.858 --> 02:29:31.205
SAM: Mostly paper is white, too.

02:29:31.205 --> 02:29:33.174
LAURA: Well, it doesn't work like that.

02:29:33.174 --> 02:29:34.726
SAM: I don't know how it works.

02:29:34.726 --> 02:29:39.439
TRAVIS: Are we going back out, or are we turning
in? Some of us are beat to shit.

02:29:39.439 --> 02:29:41.335
LAURA: Do you guys want to split up the 200?

02:29:41.335 --> 02:29:43.249
MARISHA: Jester, why don't you keep that?

02:29:43.249 --> 02:29:47.249
ASHLEY: Jester, it's your money.

02:29:47.249 --> 02:29:52.243
MARISHA: We just kicked ass and made 200. We'll do
it again tomorrow.

02:29:52.243 --> 02:29:58.532
LAURA: That is true. I'm going to put this in a
special place, so that we have it in case we need

02:29:58.532 --> 02:29:59.725
it. Okay?

02:29:59.725 --> 02:30:01.219
MARISHA: Sure. The emergency fund.

02:30:01.219 --> 02:30:05.653
LAURA: Exactly. This will be "Mom's Emergency
Fund."

02:30:05.653 --> 02:30:08.062
MARISHA: Sure. Yeah.

02:30:08.062 --> 02:30:11.793
LAURA: I'm going to paint that on the bag. "Mom's
Emergency Fund."

02:30:11.793 --> 02:30:18.841
TRAVIS: All right, well, I'm getting tired. I'm
going to turn in to the other room, if anybody

02:30:18.841 --> 02:30:22.026
feels like joining. Congratulations, Jester.
That's very exciting.

02:30:22.026 --> 02:30:23.742
TALIESIN: How deep of a sleeper are you?

02:30:23.742 --> 02:30:27.194
TRAVIS: I don't know, I feel like after a day like
today, pretty fucking deep.

02:30:27.194 --> 02:30:29.002
TALIESIN: Cool. We'll find out. I'm going to go
downstairs

02:30:29.002 --> 02:30:34.567
MATT: Okay. All right, so you head downstairs.

02:30:34.567 --> 02:30:40.229
TALIESIN: I'm going to at least need the best
masseuse they have who's also willing to do other

02:30:40.229 --> 02:30:43.501
interesting things. And someone to feed me and
talk to me as the entire thing is going on.

02:30:43.501 --> 02:30:52.824
MATT: The madam goes, "Well, I can definitely
provide those requests. That sounds like a two

02:30:52.824 --> 02:30:54.627
"companion request."

02:30:54.627 --> 02:30:55.979
TALIESIN: I would imagine so.

02:30:55.979 --> 02:31:01.769
SAM: Wait, just so I'm clear: Do you get a full
release massage while you're eating a steak or

02:31:01.769 --> 02:31:03.356
something?

02:31:03.356 --> 02:31:08.264
TALIESIN: Fruit. Don't be crass. That's just
weird.

02:31:08.264 --> 02:31:11.875
MATT: "Preference? Male, female, in between?"

02:31:11.875 --> 02:31:15.049
TALIESIN: Best hands, best conversationalist.
Surprise me.

02:31:15.049 --> 02:31:20.907
MATT: "Very well. That will run you 20 gold."

02:31:20.907 --> 02:31:25.577
TALIESIN: I pay it, and you can sleep through it
or not, if you like.

02:31:25.577 --> 02:31:28.991
TRAVIS: I'm just going to be turning my face to
the wall.

02:31:28.991 --> 02:31:31.254
TALIESIN: Welcome back to college, man!

02:31:31.254 --> 02:31:32.741
TRAVIS: College roommates.

02:31:32.741 --> 02:31:41.054
MATT: As the rest of you are turning in for the
evening, to relax. You all eventually get

02:31:41.054 --> 02:31:45.419
yourselves comfortable. Caleb, you're reading
through your book. Then, at the door, (knocking)

02:31:45.419 --> 02:31:52.321
of the male room, and it opens up. There you see a
young man and a young woman both enter, in nice

02:31:52.321 --> 02:31:53.883
silk robes.

02:31:53.883 --> 02:31:56.940
LAURA: Oh, it's in the room?

02:31:56.940 --> 02:31:59.884
TALIESIN: Oh yes. Had you not put that together
yet?

02:31:59.884 --> 02:32:02.333
MATT: Both human.

02:32:02.333 --> 02:32:04.982
TALIESIN: We got two rooms.

02:32:04.982 --> 02:32:10.556
MATT: "All right, so, who requested the service?"

02:32:10.556 --> 02:32:12.727
TALIESIN: Oh excellent! Are you on the bed?

02:32:12.727 --> 02:32:14.523
TRAVIS: Not anymore.

02:32:14.523 --> 02:32:19.981
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to take the bed, and I'm
going to take my full massage and otherwise.

02:32:19.981 --> 02:32:21.992
ASHLEY: And otherwise?

02:32:21.992 --> 02:32:26.773
TALIESIN: If you would also like some food, I'm
sure they'd be willing to--

02:32:26.773 --> 02:32:29.728
MATT: They bring in a small platter of grapes, and
other fruit.

02:32:29.728 --> 02:32:39.618
TRAVIS: I'll take an apple and say: Godspeed. I
will leave the room.

02:32:39.618 --> 02:32:42.475
MATT: Caleb?

02:32:42.475 --> 02:32:50.321
LIAM: I leave the room and actually run downstairs
and ask the front desk if they have another room.

02:32:50.321 --> 02:32:53.525
MATT: "Yes, of course, another room can be
provided."

02:32:53.525 --> 02:32:55.011
LIAM: How much is that?

02:32:55.011 --> 02:32:57.865
MATT: "For your troupe, that would be four gold
for a third."

02:32:57.865 --> 02:32:59.576
LIAM: Excellent. <i>Ja.</i> Here you go.

02:32:59.576 --> 02:33:05.908
MATT: "All right, here's your key. It's two doors
down from the one on the left that you originally

02:33:05.908 --> 02:33:07.867
"purchased with your friends."

02:33:07.867 --> 02:33:10.560
MARISHA: Is it the four ladies in a room?

02:33:10.560 --> 02:33:19.497
TRAVIS: I'm doing the old college hallway sit.
Just outside the door like-- That's my room.

02:33:19.497 --> 02:33:21.638
Occupied.

02:33:21.638 --> 02:33:25.505
LAURA: Can we hear? Are we next door to this room?
Can we hear what's happening?

02:33:25.505 --> 02:33:26.987
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:33:26.987 --> 02:33:31.584
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm sure at the very least I knock
on the door and say; I'm having fruit if anyone

02:33:31.584 --> 02:33:32.843
wants anything.

02:33:32.843 --> 02:33:34.117
SAM: I rolled a 14.

02:33:34.117 --> 02:33:35.477
LAURA: I rolled a seven.

02:33:35.477 --> 02:33:39.706
MARISHA: I rolled a 16 plus-- Oh, 19?

02:33:39.706 --> 02:33:41.222
TRAVIS: 18.

02:33:41.222 --> 02:33:44.512
LIAM: I rolled a one. Are we done taking
donations?

02:33:44.512 --> 02:33:47.228
MATT: Taking donations?

02:33:47.228 --> 02:33:49.759
LIAM: You know, for 826? That's all done now,
right?

02:33:49.759 --> 02:33:51.015
MATT: I think so, yeah.

02:33:51.015 --> 02:33:52.898
LIAM: So now they're just straight-up bad.

02:33:52.898 --> 02:34:01.259
MARISHA: Man, in context that was weird as fuck! I
rolled a 19.

02:34:01.259 --> 02:34:04.335
TALIESIN: It's mostly ridiculous conversation
through this whole thing.

02:34:04.335 --> 02:34:05.740
LAURA: Can we hear?

02:34:05.740 --> 02:34:07.718
MATT: All you hear are giggles.

02:34:07.718 --> 02:34:09.222
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:34:09.222 --> 02:34:11.077
MARISHA: I poke my head out. Do I see Fjord?

02:34:11.077 --> 02:34:13.008
MATT: You see Fjord in the hallway. Yeah.

02:34:13.008 --> 02:34:14.516
MARISHA: Psst.

02:34:14.516 --> 02:34:16.569
TRAVIS: Hey. How you doing?

02:34:16.569 --> 02:34:25.358
MARISHA: You're in the most expensive hotel in 100
miles and you're in the hallway. That's real

02:34:25.358 --> 02:34:26.608
fucking funny.

02:34:26.608 --> 02:34:28.840
TRAVIS: Yeah. Molly got a guy and a girl that
walked in with food.

02:34:28.840 --> 02:34:33.089
MARISHA: You want to come in our room so you're
not in the hall?

02:34:33.089 --> 02:34:35.062
TRAVIS: Do you have people in there with food?

02:34:35.062 --> 02:34:39.648
MARISHA: I have Nott and Jester and Jester has
pastries.

02:34:39.648 --> 02:34:41.946
LAURA: Yasha's in here, too!

02:34:41.946 --> 02:34:44.589
MARISHA: We could order room service. You want to
come in and order room service?

02:34:44.589 --> 02:34:46.318
TRAVIS: Yeah, that sounds fine.

02:34:46.318 --> 02:34:48.714
MARISHA: Let's do that. We order room service.

02:34:48.714 --> 02:34:55.362
LIAM: About when this is happening, I pull the
wire out of my coat and hold it into my palmed

02:34:55.362 --> 02:35:09.810
hands and Message to Nott. Nott, will you find an
excuse to bring Beauregard and yourself to my room

02:35:09.810 --> 02:35:11.477
you saw me go into?

02:35:11.477 --> 02:35:13.267
SAM: Message received.

02:35:13.267 --> 02:35:15.332
TRAVIS: What?

02:35:15.332 --> 02:35:17.943
SAM: Huh? Nothing. I didn't say anything.

02:35:17.943 --> 02:35:19.558
LAURA: You said "Message received."

02:35:19.558 --> 02:35:22.423
SAM: I was practicing a new catchphrase.

02:35:22.423 --> 02:35:24.142
LAURA: It's weird.

02:35:24.142 --> 02:35:26.865
SAM: That's why I'm practicing.

02:35:26.865 --> 02:35:28.727
LAURA: You should try a different one.

02:35:28.727 --> 02:35:34.670
MARISHA: I kind of like it. I don't know. Like,
you hit someone--

02:35:34.670 --> 02:35:37.317
SAM and MARISHA: Message received!

02:35:37.317 --> 02:35:39.368
MARISHA: Yeah, that's great. I'm kind of into it!

02:35:39.368 --> 02:35:43.817
SAM: It's a little heady.

02:35:43.817 --> 02:35:46.964
MARISHA: Yeah. You have to unpack in the moment.

02:35:46.964 --> 02:35:54.523
SAM: Yeah. Hey, you know what? Did you order the
room service yet?

02:35:54.523 --> 02:35:55.914
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:35:55.914 --> 02:35:58.830
LAURA: We called down?

02:35:58.830 --> 02:36:06.098
SAM: I think the phone's broken, so maybe me and
Beau should go deliver the order downstairs.

02:36:06.098 --> 02:36:07.277
LAURA: Oh, okay.

02:36:07.277 --> 02:36:09.485
MARISHA: I mean, yeah.

02:36:09.485 --> 02:36:13.231
LAURA: Yes. Tell them we want cookies and milk for
sure.

02:36:13.231 --> 02:36:15.155
ASHLEY: A rat--

02:36:15.155 --> 02:36:17.719
SAM: Oh! We didn't eat our rats yet!

02:36:17.719 --> 02:36:20.654
ASHLEY: Well, we can get them here, and then save
those for another--

02:36:20.654 --> 02:36:23.296
SAM: I mean, they'll die!

02:36:23.296 --> 02:36:26.626
MATT: The rats are currently back at the Leaky
Tap.

02:36:26.626 --> 02:36:27.629
SAM: Oh.

02:36:27.629 --> 02:36:28.911
LAURA: Oh, that's right.

02:36:28.911 --> 02:36:32.081
MATT: Well, no, you haven't. No, you still have
them, you haven't gone back.

02:36:32.081 --> 02:36:36.144
SAM: Should we toast now?

02:36:36.144 --> 02:36:39.470
ASHLEY: Well, yeah. I am pretty hungry.

02:36:39.470 --> 02:36:41.425
LAURA: But Yasha likes to cook hers, remember.

02:36:41.425 --> 02:36:43.334
ASHLEY: You don't like to cook yours?

02:36:43.334 --> 02:36:44.690
SAM: Uh, no.

02:36:44.690 --> 02:36:55.003
ASHLEY: Nott, that's crazy. I mean, I'll try it,
but I feel like it's much-- Do you want me to have

02:36:55.003 --> 02:36:56.942
them cook it? Have you ever had it cooked?

02:36:56.942 --> 02:36:57.948
SAM: No.

02:36:57.948 --> 02:36:59.442
ASHLEY: With a little salt, little pepper.

02:36:59.442 --> 02:37:00.527
SAM: No.

02:37:00.527 --> 02:37:02.843
LAURA: I don't know if they will cook rats here,
though.

02:37:02.843 --> 02:37:03.842
ASHLEY: No?

02:37:03.842 --> 02:37:10.531
LAURA: Most of the places that charge a lot of
money for rooms don't usually cook rats. But they

02:37:10.531 --> 02:37:12.945
do have other animals that they will cook for you.

02:37:12.945 --> 02:37:14.857
ASHLEY: What do they have?

02:37:14.857 --> 02:37:22.895
LAURA: Probably like a cow, or a deer, or an
owlbear or something.

02:37:22.895 --> 02:37:25.760
MARISHA: How about this: we'll tell them to give
us the chef's choice. The special.

02:37:25.760 --> 02:37:27.743
MATT: The giggling gets louder from the other
room.

02:37:27.743 --> 02:37:30.834
TRAVIS: Oh god. I can't tell who that's coming
from.

02:37:30.834 --> 02:37:33.013
MARISHA: Oh god. Come on, let's go.

02:37:33.013 --> 02:37:36.442
SAM: Give me your rat and I'll have them cook it
and bring it back for you.

02:37:36.442 --> 02:37:38.028
MARISHA: We're spending enough money on this
place.

02:37:38.028 --> 02:37:39.285
ASHLEY: Are you sure you won't take it?

02:37:39.285 --> 02:37:40.531
SAM: I won't eat your rat.

02:37:40.531 --> 02:37:42.065
ASHLEY: Do you promise me?

02:37:42.065 --> 02:37:45.440
SAM: Do you promise not to kill me in my sleep
because you're a Xhorhasian spy?

02:37:45.440 --> 02:37:47.605
TALIESIN: (loud giggling)

02:37:47.605 --> 02:37:54.977
SAM: If I don't eat your rat, you can't kill me in
my sleep because you're a Xhorhasian spy.

02:37:54.977 --> 02:37:57.254
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:37:57.254 --> 02:38:03.552
MATT: With a (squeak) as you pull it away.

02:38:03.552 --> 02:38:05.658
SAM: All right. Let's go order some food.

02:38:05.658 --> 02:38:06.866
MARISHA: Okay.

02:38:06.866 --> 02:38:08.950
MATT: You make your way to Caleb's room?

02:38:08.950 --> 02:38:14.461
SAM: As soon as we get out of the room, I say: I
was told to bring you to Caleb. I don't know why.

02:38:14.461 --> 02:38:19.524
MARISHA: Can we go order food first? Then we'll go
hit Caleb, because it's going to be, like, 45-60

02:38:19.524 --> 02:38:21.595
minutes to deliver it.

02:38:21.595 --> 02:38:25.124
SAM: Sure. Right, it does take a while to deliver.
All right, we go order food first.

02:38:25.124 --> 02:38:30.614
MATT: All right, you go order food, for the
breadth of the evening meals it costs we'll say

02:38:30.614 --> 02:38:33.498
one gold, five silver for food for everybody.

02:38:33.498 --> 02:38:36.938
LAURA: What do you guys want to do in the room
now?

02:38:36.938 --> 02:38:46.402
SAM: I'm going to send a few Messages out. Caleb,
what room are you in? Caleb, what room are you in?

02:38:46.402 --> 02:38:47.754
Caleb, what room?

02:38:47.754 --> 02:38:50.067
LIAM: If I eventually catch it, I give Nott the
room number.

02:38:50.086 --> 02:38:52.079
SAM: Oh, okay. He's in room six.

02:38:52.079 --> 02:38:57.120
MATT: You guys make your way to Caleb's room.

02:38:57.120 --> 02:39:00.207
SAM: (knocking)

02:39:00.207 --> 02:39:01.804
MARISHA: (knocking)

02:39:01.804 --> 02:39:03.332
LAURA: Jesus.

02:39:03.332 --> 02:39:04.870
LIAM: Come in.

02:39:04.870 --> 02:39:10.168
SAM: I brought the monk. Are we discussing some
escape plans?

02:39:10.168 --> 02:39:22.964
LIAM: Potentially. You know, we're leaving soon,
and Beauregard has an in at one of the bigger

02:39:22.964 --> 02:39:28.652
libraries in the city and I want to go there
before we leave.

02:39:28.652 --> 02:39:31.710
SAM: Excellent, let's go. Tomorrow, right? When
they're open.

02:39:31.710 --> 02:39:39.975
LIAM: Yes, but Beauregard has given me a
condition. She had some questions for me, and I

02:39:39.975 --> 02:39:49.018
would like to answer them, but I don't feel right
telling her and not telling you, so I would love

02:39:49.018 --> 02:39:51.896
for you to stay here for a few minutes.

02:39:51.896 --> 02:40:00.323
SAM: Sure, yes, whatever you want, Caleb. It
sounds serious.

02:40:00.323 --> 02:40:05.080
LIAM: Beauregard, may I ask you a question to
start?

02:40:05.080 --> 02:40:06.337
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:40:06.337 --> 02:40:16.729
LIAM: How do you feel about the Empire?

02:40:16.729 --> 02:40:19.304
MARISHA: Oh, I mean--

02:40:19.304 --> 02:40:22.243
LIAM: Are you in favor of how things are going
here?

02:40:22.243 --> 02:40:30.339
MARISHA: No, but I'm not in favor of many things.
I don't like a lot of things. Kind of have a

02:40:30.339 --> 02:40:37.070
problem with authority and they're like the
epitome of authority. I watched my father

02:40:37.070 --> 02:40:48.510
sacrifice a lot to try and impress those people.
I'm not sure what it was for. Seems like a lot.

02:40:48.510 --> 02:40:50.984
LIAM: Are you comfortable with business as usual?

02:40:50.984 --> 02:40:56.334
MARISHA: What? How do you mean?

02:40:56.334 --> 02:41:00.420
LIAM: Do you approve of how the Empire is going?

02:41:00.420 --> 02:41:10.217
MARISHA: I'm not super invested in the
political spectrum, I just don't want any part of

02:41:10.217 --> 02:41:15.130
it. So no? I think it could be better. No.

02:41:15.130 --> 02:41:17.913
LIAM: Is she lying to me about being not
invested?

02:41:17.913 --> 02:41:22.127
MATT: I mean, that's up to you if you want to--

02:41:22.127 --> 02:41:24.799
MARISHA: No.

02:41:24.799 --> 02:41:27.067
MATT: As far as I know, yeah, she's being pretty
forthright.

02:41:27.067 --> 02:41:28.771
LIAM: Do I have to shout, "Insight check," or--

02:41:28.771 --> 02:41:32.415
MATT: No, it's up to her whether or not she
decides if she needs to or not.

02:41:32.415 --> 02:41:36.540
MARISHA: Marisha's telling you, Beau is being
genuine.

02:41:36.540 --> 02:41:37.673
MATT: Yeah.

02:41:37.673 --> 02:41:39.928
LIAM: Oh. Not super invested about how the empire
is going?

02:41:39.928 --> 02:41:45.478
MARISHA: I think--

02:41:45.478 --> 02:41:47.311
TRAVIS: Everybody's lying!

02:41:47.311 --> 02:41:54.317
MARISHA: I have no investment in their success or
failure. I think most of them tend to be scumbags

02:41:54.317 --> 02:42:02.472
who want monetary and influential gain, and I
think they treat their poor pretty shitty and they

02:42:02.472 --> 02:42:10.555
treat their elite pretty great, and I think that's
sucky. Yeah, I think they're garbage people, but

02:42:10.555 --> 02:42:13.120
Molly thinks I'm a garbage person--

02:42:13.120 --> 02:42:14.335
SAM: Trash person.

02:42:14.335 --> 02:42:19.071
MARISHA: Sorry, a trash person. If they're garbage
people, I'm their rare cousin, the trash person.

02:42:19.071 --> 02:42:25.029
LIAM: I would like to get if my reading on if that
is genuine or not. Yeah?

02:42:25.029 --> 02:42:26.392
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:42:26.392 --> 02:42:30.779
LIAM: Okay, so, Liam asking a question, and this
is your choice. It's just an idea that popped in

02:42:30.779 --> 02:42:35.369
my head. Could I request that everybody but Sam
and Marisha leave the table?

02:42:35.369 --> 02:42:36.911
MATT: You can, yeah.

02:42:36.911 --> 02:42:38.168
LIAM: Yeah.

02:42:38.168 --> 02:42:40.312
MATT: Can we get everybody else but Sam and
Marisha to leave?

02:42:40.312 --> 02:42:45.306
LAURA: Bitch! Fine, bitch! I didn't want to listen
anyway, bitch!

02:42:45.306 --> 02:42:50.177
SAM: That means you, too, Matt!

02:42:50.177 --> 02:42:54.589
MATT: Oh, sure. Well, then!

02:42:54.589 --> 02:42:59.593
MARISHA: Yeah, I--

02:42:59.593 --> 02:43:02.408
TRAVIS: (yelling)

02:43:02.408 --> 02:43:09.208
MARISHA: I watched my father sacrifice a lot to
get where he was, and I'm not sure if it was

02:43:09.208 --> 02:43:21.210
fucking worth it. So the Empire doesn't lean
favorably in my spectrum. But I also don't care if

02:43:21.210 --> 02:43:24.066
they really live or die or whatever.

02:43:24.066 --> 02:43:31.474
LIAM: Well, I really want to go to the library
tomorrow.

02:43:31.474 --> 02:43:33.411
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:43:33.411 --> 02:43:36.771
LIAM: This may be a very stupid decision of mine.

02:43:36.771 --> 02:43:38.001
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:43:38.001 --> 02:43:43.813
SAM: What does she want from you?

02:43:43.813 --> 02:43:49.643
LIAM: Would you be willing to leave with me
tomorrow if I asked you to?

02:43:49.643 --> 02:43:51.205
SAM: Of course.

02:43:51.205 --> 02:43:52.245
LIAM: Just the two of us?

02:43:52.245 --> 02:43:58.141
SAM: Absolutely. Right away. Whatever you want.
But why?

02:43:58.141 --> 02:44:02.343
MARISHA: Is the secret that valuable?

02:44:02.343 --> 02:44:10.603
LIAM: I am going to tell you the story of how I
murdered my mother and father.

02:44:10.603 --> 02:44:12.727
SAM: Oh!

02:44:17.934 --> 02:44:29.154
LIAM: When I was younger, I grew up in a small
township outside of Rexxentrum called Blumenthal.

02:44:29.273 --> 02:44:42.138
My mother's name was Una. My father's name was
Leofric. Everyone was very excited about me when I

02:44:42.138 --> 02:44:52.408
was young. I was bright and confident. People used
to say that I glided through life and everything

02:44:52.408 --> 02:45:11.002
just worked for me. As I got older, it became
clear that I had a knack for the arcane. Everyone

02:45:11.002 --> 02:45:21.547
talked about this Soltryce Academy, maybe I would
go there someday. The way they do things at that

02:45:21.547 --> 02:45:30.891
Academy, they don't take all comers, they look for
the diamond in the rough and every couple of years

02:45:30.891 --> 02:45:40.967
they find one. But when I was a young man,
adolescent, really, they found three of us.

02:45:40.967 --> 02:45:46.022
Another boy and a girl, and--

02:45:46.022 --> 02:45:47.863
SAM: From your town?

02:45:47.863 --> 02:45:56.686
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, from Blumenthal. And we were
accepted.

02:45:56.686 --> 02:46:00.075
SAM: How old were you?

02:46:00.075 --> 02:46:05.664
LIAM: I was young.

02:46:05.664 --> 02:46:11.647
MARISHA: What's young? Teenager?

02:46:11.647 --> 02:46:22.109
LIAM: Yeah. Anyway, we went there. I studied for a
year. I worked so hard. It came easier to me than

02:46:22.109 --> 02:46:29.902
the other two, but they were also very
accomplished. There were other students from other

02:46:29.902 --> 02:46:42.103
parts of the Empire there, and a little over a
year of learning all they had to impart, I met a

02:46:42.103 --> 02:46:57.021
man named Trent Ikithon. He became our teacher.

02:46:57.021 --> 02:47:01.873
MARISHA: Why didn't you say anything earlier?

02:47:01.873 --> 02:47:07.305
LIAM: Earlier when, earlier tonight? Earlier a
week ago? What do you mean?

02:47:07.305 --> 02:47:12.613
MARISHA: When we were talking to Trent. You know
we were talking to Trent.

02:47:12.613 --> 02:47:30.259
LIAM: After a year of studying in the main school,
Trent handpicked all three of us again, and we

02:47:30.259 --> 02:47:39.523
left the school proper and went with him to a home
out in the countryside where he trained us. It was

02:47:39.523 --> 02:47:52.647
a good time. We believed in the Empire, we were
going to keep it strong. He was cruel. He hurt us

02:47:52.647 --> 02:48:09.584
a lot. Made us go through extreme circumstances,
but we got strong. I also fell in love, but that's

02:48:09.584 --> 02:48:10.923
another story.

02:48:10.923 --> 02:48:12.785
MARISHA: One of the other students.

02:48:12.785 --> 02:48:29.112
LIAM: Yeah. We rose through the ranks and it was
the Empire over all, and eventually, he wanted to

02:48:29.112 --> 02:48:38.416
test our allegiance, so strangers were brought
in-- traitors. Disgusting people, <i>traitors</i> to

02:48:38.416 --> 02:48:42.417
this empire, and we killed them.

02:48:42.463 --> 02:48:44.889
SAM: You were just students?

02:48:45.001 --> 02:48:46.487
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

02:48:46.596 --> 02:48:49.263
MARISHA: He made you executioners?

02:48:49.263 --> 02:48:50.985
LIAM: We wanted to be.

02:48:50.985 --> 02:48:57.103
MARISHA: Caleb, that's deeply fucked up, you know
that, right?

02:48:57.103 --> 02:49:09.478
LIAM: Yeah. A few months of studying, of a little
bit of torture, a little bit of murdering

02:49:09.478 --> 02:49:13.426
dissidents and traitors and deviants.

02:49:13.426 --> 02:49:20.487
MARISHA: Then one day your parents are brought in
as traitors. No?

02:49:20.487 --> 02:49:35.937
LIAM: No. We were ready to graduate, and the last
test of our allegiance was-- I'm getting ahead of

02:49:35.937 --> 02:49:43.307
myself. I went on a trip home and visited my
parents and when I was there, in the middle of the

02:49:43.307 --> 02:49:49.918
night, I awoke and overhead them talking, and went
to the stair and listened to them talk about

02:49:49.918 --> 02:50:04.949
revolution and tearing the Empire down, and I felt
disgraced and shame for my family. My mother and

02:50:04.949 --> 02:50:11.258
my father, who were so wonderful to me when I was
a child, and were so happy for me to go to the

02:50:11.258 --> 02:50:22.304
Academy and believe in the Empire <i>so much</i>. I
went back to the school and when the three of us

02:50:22.304 --> 02:50:37.845
were summoned and told what was expected of us, I
knew what had to be done. We went to this other

02:50:37.845 --> 02:50:53.707
boy's home first, Eodwulf, and we stood by as he
killed his parents. We went to Astrid's house, and

02:50:53.707 --> 02:51:06.410
had dinner with them, and she poisoned them. Then
we went to my home and we grabbed a horse cart,

02:51:06.410 --> 02:51:13.238
and in the middle of the night, placed it against
the door to the home and I set it on fire.

02:51:13.238 --> 02:51:22.058
MARISHA: You had to do this to graduate, to prove
your loyalty.

02:51:22.058 --> 02:51:33.662
LIAM: Well, yeah, but it didn't exactly go
according to that plan because as soon as I heard

02:51:33.662 --> 02:51:51.676
my mother and father screaming inside... I was so
sure. I was so sure... until I wasn't, and I broke a bit.

02:51:51.782 --> 02:51:54.096
SAM: Did you go in after them?

02:51:54.096 --> 02:52:19.920
LIAM: No, I went to an asylum for a number of
years. I broke. I don't remember so well what

02:52:19.920 --> 02:52:42.797
happened to me there. It was quite a number of
years. Years later, a woman was there, and she,

02:52:42.797 --> 02:52:59.780
another patient, put hands on me, and she took the
clouds away. She took it all away, and not just my

02:52:59.780 --> 02:53:12.218
madness, but the fake memories that Ikithon put in
my head of my parents.

02:53:12.218 --> 02:53:14.381
SAM: Fake memories?

02:53:14.381 --> 02:53:15.935
LIAM: Wanting to betr-- yes.

02:53:15.935 --> 02:53:23.999
SAM: Wait, there was a false memory? He tricked
you?

02:53:23.999 --> 02:53:32.458
MARISHA: Into hearing their talks against the
Empire, is that what it was?

02:53:32.458 --> 02:53:36.864
LIAM: Yes, but it doesn't matter, because I still
wanted to do it when I did it.

02:53:36.864 --> 02:53:39.192
SAM: But you didn't know what you were doing--

02:53:39.192 --> 02:53:40.576
LIAM: So what?

02:53:40.576 --> 02:53:41.466
SAM: You were brainwashed.

02:53:41.466 --> 02:53:42.326
LIAM: So what?!

02:53:42.326 --> 02:53:43.514
SAM: Programmed.

02:53:43.514 --> 02:53:52.753
LIAM: Doesn't matter, I should have-- I'm a
disgusting person. It doesn't matter. Anyway, all

02:53:52.753 --> 02:54:02.867
that gone, just like that. I ran. Not right away;
I pretended like nothing had changed for several

02:54:02.867 --> 02:54:17.135
weeks. She was stark raving mad 15 minutes later
herself, the woman who helped me. I killed one of

02:54:17.135 --> 02:54:29.531
Trent's people there, and took this. I pull out
the necklace. This has been keeping me hidden for

02:54:29.531 --> 02:54:32.041
years. For five years.

02:54:32.041 --> 02:54:33.889
SAM: What do you mean, hidden?

02:54:33.889 --> 02:54:51.961
LIAM: They can find who they want, but not with
this. They cannot find me. I would really like to

02:54:51.961 --> 02:54:53.777
get into that library, because I would--

02:54:53.777 --> 02:54:55.579
MARISHA: Like to run again?

02:54:55.579 --> 02:55:03.635
LIAM: Hmm? No, I like you all.

02:55:03.635 --> 02:55:08.150
MARISHA: You were just talking with Nott about
running tomorrow.

02:55:08.150 --> 02:55:11.285
LIAM: Well, that all depends on you, Beauregard.

02:55:11.285 --> 02:55:13.959
MARISHA: If I don't let you in?

02:55:13.959 --> 02:55:18.823
LIAM: If you can keep a secret.

02:55:18.823 --> 02:55:40.269
MARISHA: Caleb, I'm good at keeping secrets. You
heard us talking to Trent. You know he wants

02:55:40.269 --> 02:55:50.096
Yasha, and you're the only person who knows the
atrocities that this man-- who utterly gave me the

02:55:50.096 --> 02:55:56.087
creeps, by the way, so I'm feeling a little bit
validated in the fact that I read him pretty well--

02:55:56.087 --> 02:55:57.629
SAM: I don't think it's--

02:55:57.629 --> 02:55:59.662
LIAM: Anyway.

02:55:59.662 --> 02:56:02.418
MARISHA: I'm just saying, you have a
responsibility now.

02:56:02.418 --> 02:56:05.246
LIAM: Which is?

02:56:05.246 --> 02:56:11.801
MARISHA: Keep this guy from hurting more people.

02:56:11.801 --> 02:56:15.646
LIAM: Well, that's precisely why I want into this
library.

02:56:15.646 --> 02:56:26.988
MARISHA: You want to take down Trent. Is that why
you're doing all this? You want to take down Trent?

02:56:26.988 --> 02:56:29.281
LIAM: Among other things.

02:56:29.281 --> 02:56:34.553
MARISHA: Ah. What are you hoping to find?

02:56:34.553 --> 02:56:51.528
LIAM: Anybody can make lights. Anybody could send
a message through a wire. I want to bend reality

02:56:51.528 --> 02:56:53.341
to my will.

02:56:53.341 --> 02:57:11.524
MARISHA: Caleb, you don't, though. No one wants
that amount of power and responsibility.

02:57:11.524 --> 02:57:22.352
LIAM: Yeah, well, I told you why I am afraid of
fire. So you are going to bring me to that

02:57:22.352 --> 02:57:23.967
library.

02:57:23.967 --> 02:57:36.638
MARISHA: Don't worry, I'll take you to the
library. There are two options here: you can

02:57:36.638 --> 02:57:49.896
selfishly try and go after this guy for your own
vendetta, or you can use your motives to keep

02:57:49.896 --> 02:57:52.628
others from getting hurt in a very similar way.

02:57:52.628 --> 02:57:58.658
LIAM: Both of those are appealing to me.

02:57:58.658 --> 02:58:06.823
MARISHA: All right. I know you just make dancing
lights-- or at least you can feel like you just

02:58:06.823 --> 02:58:14.141
make dancing lights-- but those dancing lights
make sure I can punch people in the fucking face

02:58:14.141 --> 02:58:26.314
whenever I can't see shit. A little bit of
teamwork goes a long way.

02:58:26.314 --> 02:58:35.952
LIAM: Okay, good. I think Nott and I are going to
retire now. Maybe you can go get that food for the

02:58:35.952 --> 02:58:37.307
others.

02:58:37.307 --> 02:58:47.458
MARISHA: Cool, man, cool. Kick me out of the room,
I get it. Yep, all right.

02:58:47.458 --> 02:58:49.391
SAM: You want to stay here?

02:58:49.391 --> 02:58:53.702
MARISHA: No, I mean, you just dumped some
heavy-ass shit like that and then ask me to leave.

02:58:53.702 --> 02:58:55.282
No, I get it, it's fine.

02:58:55.282 --> 02:58:56.553
LIAM: Yeah.

02:58:56.553 --> 02:59:02.748
MARISHA: All right, I'll leave.

02:59:02.748 --> 02:59:06.269
LIAM: But you don't have to leave the table.

02:59:06.269 --> 02:59:07.209
MARISHA: No.

02:59:07.209 --> 02:59:09.577
LIAM: I'm not asking you to leave the table.

02:59:09.577 --> 02:59:18.410
MARISHA: I'll keep your secret. We'll keep all
this a secret. I don't think it's anything to be

02:59:18.410 --> 02:59:20.015
ashamed of, though.

02:59:20.015 --> 02:59:31.972
LIAM: (laughs slightly hysterically)

02:59:31.972 --> 02:59:33.469
MARISHA: We'll figure it out in time.

02:59:33.469 --> 02:59:35.275
LIAM: Goodnight, Beauregard.

02:59:35.275 --> 02:59:38.788
MARISHA: Caleb (clicks). Nott.

02:59:38.788 --> 02:59:41.065
SAM: Good evening.

02:59:41.065 --> 02:59:46.693
MARISHA: I have a charcuterie board coming to the
girls' room, if anybody wants any.

02:59:46.693 --> 02:59:51.194
LIAM: (door slamming)

02:59:51.194 --> 03:00:04.183
SAM: I go over and I throw my arms around him and
hug him. I'm so sorry. It wasn't you, it's not

03:00:04.183 --> 03:00:16.249
your fault. It wasn't you, you were made to do it.
It's <i>not</i> your fault. It's not your fault. I know

03:00:16.249 --> 03:00:26.712
you don't realize that now, but you will. This
pain that you have, that you wear all over you

03:00:26.712 --> 03:00:42.031
like a mask, it's just that, and you can take it
off someday. I know it hurts, but it wasn't your

03:00:42.031 --> 03:00:48.248
fault. I'm going to keep telling you that until
you believe me.

03:00:48.248 --> 03:00:54.796
LIAM: Are you and I good?

03:00:54.796 --> 03:01:14.954
SAM: What you did was awful, truly terrible,
despicable and unforgivable-- until you can

03:01:15.081 --> 03:01:25.465
forgive it. At some point, you'll have to do that.
I swear to you that I will be at your side until

03:01:25.465 --> 03:01:28.006
you do.

03:01:28.006 --> 03:01:33.737
LIAM: I have an idea that can make that happen.

03:01:33.737 --> 03:01:35.469
SAM: Really?

03:01:35.469 --> 03:01:40.164
LIAM: Yes. It will take a lot of hard work.

03:01:40.164 --> 03:01:43.353
SAM: A lot of books.

03:01:43.353 --> 03:01:45.529
LIAM: And a lot of books.

03:01:45.529 --> 03:01:56.687
SAM: I'm in. Whatever you need, just tell me and
I'll get it for you.

03:01:56.687 --> 03:02:10.231
LIAM: I pull out the silver thread and I start
putting it around the room, and go over some

03:02:10.231 --> 03:02:18.680
notes. I have some ideas already, some ideas I
had, and I will stay up another hour or two before

03:02:18.680 --> 03:02:20.878
going to bed.

03:02:20.878 --> 03:02:29.116
MATT: Can we retrieve the rest of the group,
please? Back to the table. (sharp exhale)

03:02:29.116 --> 03:02:32.707
SAM: Fart jokes!

03:02:32.707 --> 03:02:36.329
MATT: We got a Caleb lore dump.

03:02:36.329 --> 03:02:37.821
MARISHA: Huh?

03:02:37.821 --> 03:02:47.700
MATT: Got a Caleb lore dump. As you find
yourselves reading for a bit, eventually a knock

03:02:47.700 --> 03:02:53.558
comes at the door, and a little bit of snacks are
brought over from the side of the girls' room, if

03:02:53.558 --> 03:03:01.425
you want some. The food arrives at your guys'
room, and the knock does come at your room, Molly.

03:03:01.425 --> 03:03:05.710
As the food arrives, the door opens, and the
two--

03:03:05.710 --> 03:03:08.066
TALIESIN: Oh, is the food arriving?

03:03:08.066 --> 03:03:11.350
MATT: The food has arrived as the companions and
you have completed your evening--

03:03:11.350 --> 03:03:14.905
TALIESIN: Okay, in that case, I am going to
enter--

03:03:14.905 --> 03:03:16.283
SAM: You're cleaning up.

03:03:16.283 --> 03:03:24.005
TALIESIN: Oh no, I've thought about this. I had
time to think while watching things outside. Not

03:03:24.005 --> 03:03:30.118
you guys. I've got the remnants of the fruit. I'm
coming in with the food into their room, and I am

03:03:30.118 --> 03:03:34.219
wearing nothing but my tapestry.

03:03:34.219 --> 03:03:39.028
(laughter)

03:03:39.028 --> 03:03:42.833
TALIESIN: I am your god, long may I reign. Eat of
my fruits.

03:03:42.833 --> 03:03:45.490
MARISHA: I just ordered another fruit platter.

03:03:45.490 --> 03:03:49.930
TALIESIN: It's good. I got through a lot of this.

03:03:49.930 --> 03:03:55.938
MARISHA: But long may he reign. Huzzah.

03:03:55.938 --> 03:03:58.512
LIAM: We're still pre-sleepy time?

03:03:58.512 --> 03:04:00.644
MATT: If there's something else you want to do.

03:04:00.644 --> 03:04:02.164
LIAM: No, I want to go to the bathroom.

03:04:02.164 --> 03:04:04.884
MATT: Then you may go to the bathroom if you'd
like, and we're going to come back in the

03:04:04.884 --> 03:04:05.851
morning.

03:04:05.851 --> 03:04:07.013
LIAM: Thanks, Dad!

03:04:07.013 --> 03:04:08.872
MATT: Whenever the rest of our group returns?

03:04:08.872 --> 03:04:14.556
SAM: Laura and Travis went home, they have a--
Yeah, Dateline was on?

03:04:14.556 --> 03:04:17.008
MARISHA: 60 Minutes.

03:04:17.008 --> 03:04:18.163
MATT: Well, until they get here--

03:04:18.163 --> 03:04:21.924
SAM: Oh, no, Ashley's gone, now. It's just us.

03:04:21.924 --> 03:04:27.475
TALIESIN: If anybody had any questions they want
to ask. Laura's in the bathroom--

03:04:27.475 --> 03:04:30.491
MATT: Gotcha, no worries. (singing) Pregnancy.

03:04:30.491 --> 03:04:37.756
TALIESIN: Just looking forward to wearing a giant
Platinum Dragon. That's all I wanted.

03:04:37.756 --> 03:04:43.351
MATT: As the evening draws to a close, you all get
probably the finest rest you've had in a while.

03:04:43.351 --> 03:04:51.785
It's extravagant rooms, the inner chambers are
well-decorated, the morning window-- as the

03:04:51.785 --> 03:04:55.478
drapery is left open, the sun comes through in
golden beams--

03:04:55.478 --> 03:04:57.724
LAURA: Oh no, we missed our stuff.

03:04:57.724 --> 03:05:00.458
SAM: It's morning-time now.

03:05:00.458 --> 03:05:03.161
MATT: It's the morning time. You guys come to
consciousness.

03:05:03.161 --> 03:05:05.079
ASHLEY: We were going to play some Truth or Dare.

03:05:05.079 --> 03:05:07.318
LAURA: Well, it's fine. We did. We totally did.

03:05:07.318 --> 03:05:13.569
MATT: You gather yourselves. What are you guys
doing with the day?

03:05:13.569 --> 03:05:19.024
LAURA: Well, I guess we should go back to the
Leaky Tap there, and--

03:05:19.024 --> 03:05:21.251
TRAVIS: Can I ask for everybody to leave the room,
except for--

03:05:21.251 --> 03:05:25.109
(laughter)

03:05:25.109 --> 03:05:28.376
MATT: All right.

03:05:28.376 --> 03:05:29.808
TALIESIN: We have a cart.

03:05:29.808 --> 03:05:33.092
LAURA: Oh yeah, we can load it up.

03:05:33.092 --> 03:05:40.192
MARISHA: Where are we going, before our errands?
Or after our errands? What's the destination?

03:05:40.192 --> 03:05:41.706
TALIESIN: I'm going to get the map.

03:05:41.706 --> 03:05:43.205
MARISHA: Oh, the map!

03:05:43.205 --> 03:05:46.399
SAM: Are we all back together again? Over
breakfast?

03:05:46.399 --> 03:05:50.370
MATT: Yeah, you guys have all woken up and gotten
together again. We'll say for purposes of this

03:05:50.370 --> 03:05:55.075
that breakfast has been provided, like brought to
your room as part of the staying over, but you

03:05:55.075 --> 03:05:57.222
finish your morning.

03:05:57.222 --> 03:05:59.784
SAM: Like, continental, or like French toast?

03:05:59.784 --> 03:06:01.653
MATT: Upper-end continental.

03:06:01.653 --> 03:06:06.246
LAURA: You guys totally missed it. We had the
<i>best</i> time in the room while you guys were gone

03:06:06.246 --> 03:06:08.068
for a very long time.

03:06:08.068 --> 03:06:10.306
MATT: There you go!

03:06:10.306 --> 03:06:12.340
ASHLEY: Fjord and Jester made out.

03:06:12.340 --> 03:06:17.783
LAURA: We had a crazy orgy in our room and you
guys didn't <i>even</i> want to be part of it.

03:06:17.783 --> 03:06:23.643
SAM: Insight check! 11.

03:06:23.643 --> 03:06:27.314
TALIESIN: I'm happy to move in whatever direction
anybody likes.

03:06:27.314 --> 03:06:29.439
LAURA: Oh, you know I'm lying.

03:06:29.439 --> 03:06:31.422
ASHLEY: Wait, I roll, too. I roll, too, because I
was part of the lie.

03:06:31.422 --> 03:06:32.706
SAM: I think she's lying.

03:06:32.706 --> 03:06:34.332
MATT: You backing her up?

03:06:34.332 --> 03:06:36.572
LAURA: Did you roll shit, too?

03:06:36.572 --> 03:06:37.695
ASHLEY: I rolled a four.

03:06:37.695 --> 03:06:39.157
MATT: Yeah, they're lying through their teeth.

03:06:39.157 --> 03:06:40.381
LAURA: Man.

03:06:40.381 --> 03:06:49.498
SAM: Before we leave, shouldn't we get a lay of
the land? I mean, I trust my own ears, they're

03:06:49.498 --> 03:06:54.613
very large, but I barely heard half of a
conversation. I don't even know really what's

03:06:54.613 --> 03:06:57.433
happening other than I heard that there's a war
happening.

03:06:57.433 --> 03:07:01.570
TALIESIN: What's the good side of this, then?
What's your best-case scenario?

03:07:01.570 --> 03:07:06.536
SAM: Well maybe we should do some snooping around
town and find out if there indeed is a war before

03:07:06.536 --> 03:07:08.162
we leave town.

03:07:08.162 --> 03:07:13.381
TALIESIN: If they lock the gates, or start
conscripting--

03:07:13.381 --> 03:07:14.737
LAURA: Will they do that?

03:07:14.737 --> 03:07:17.913
TALIESIN: I don't know what they'd do. All I know
is I don't want to hang out, and obviously we've

03:07:17.913 --> 03:07:19.735
made a bit of a reputation for ourselves.

03:07:19.735 --> 03:07:22.724
LAURA: But then, any city we go into, won't they
lock us in that city?

03:07:22.724 --> 03:07:24.861
SAM: We also have allies here. We have The
Gentleman--

03:07:24.861 --> 03:07:26.062
LAURA: (gasp)

03:07:26.062 --> 03:07:27.449
TALIESIN: He's an ally now.

03:07:27.449 --> 03:07:33.861
LAURA: You know what we should do? You guys! Why
don't we talk to Dolan about it? He would tell us!

03:07:33.861 --> 03:07:36.049
SAM: Dolan! We haven't even checked in with him!

03:07:36.049 --> 03:07:37.870
MARISHA: Oh, shit! We forgot to check in with
him!

03:07:37.870 --> 03:07:40.858
LAURA: He was at the party last night! He was with
that really cool guy from Marquet.

03:07:40.858 --> 03:07:47.379
SAM: We have a bunch of allies. We can't just up
and leave without at least saying, like, we're out.

03:07:47.379 --> 03:07:49.176
LAURA: Let's go talk to Dolan.

03:07:49.176 --> 03:07:52.096
TALIESIN: Have you literally never left a town
without telling everybody because, you know,

03:07:52.096 --> 03:07:55.305
there's a possibility you're going to get
conscripted to go fight a war?

03:07:55.305 --> 03:07:57.168
SAM: I have never had allies before.

03:07:57.168 --> 03:08:02.222
LAURA: Let's go talk to Dolan, and then we'll
leave, and we'll go to Hupperdook and then we'll

03:08:02.222 --> 03:08:03.504
go to Nogvurot.

03:08:03.504 --> 03:08:05.772
SAM: Because those are funny-sounding names?

03:08:05.772 --> 03:08:11.012
LAURA: No, because <i>Hupperdook</i> is a funny
sounding name! Then Nogvurot is where our friends

03:08:11.012 --> 03:08:13.316
from the other mercenary group live.

03:08:13.316 --> 03:08:15.993
SAM: It's also where there was a string of
kidnappings.

03:08:15.993 --> 03:08:17.470
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:08:17.470 --> 03:08:22.204
TALIESIN: See, <i>that</i> sounds like our speed. <i>Not</i>
conscripting into fighting on the front lines.

03:08:22.204 --> 03:08:25.078
LAURA: We can disguise you as a kid and they could
kidnap you and you could fight them from the

03:08:25.078 --> 03:08:26.052
inside.

03:08:26.052 --> 03:08:27.275
SAM: I don't like this idea.

03:08:27.275 --> 03:08:30.842
TRAVIS: How about we go say hi to Dolan, we'll run
by The Gentleman, let him know that we're thinking

03:08:30.842 --> 03:08:33.587
about bouncing, and then we'll be on our way.

03:08:33.587 --> 03:08:35.766
ASHLEY: May I take a look at that map, Jester?

03:08:35.766 --> 03:08:36.981
LAURA: Of course, Yasha!

03:08:36.981 --> 03:08:39.468
MARISHA: Does anyone know who funds the Victory
Pit?

03:08:39.468 --> 03:08:41.814
TRAVIS: I'm sure it's the city, right?

03:08:41.814 --> 03:08:42.699
MARISHA: Probably.

03:08:42.699 --> 03:08:44.026
LAURA: We could ask Dolan about that, too.

03:08:44.026 --> 03:08:44.969
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:08:44.969 --> 03:08:46.520
TALIESIN: Don't think they don't know our names
now.

03:08:46.520 --> 03:08:54.151
LAURA: Can I say that while it was last night, I
painted a picture with the new paint for my mom?

03:08:54.151 --> 03:08:55.144
MATT: Sure.

03:08:55.144 --> 03:09:03.673
LAURA: I'm going to ask the front desk if they
will send it to her. Back to our house in the

03:09:03.673 --> 03:09:04.891
Menagerie Coast.

03:09:04.891 --> 03:09:10.345
MATT: Yeah. They're less paints and more colored
inks. You can purchase paints wherever you want

03:09:10.345 --> 03:09:11.604
to, but these are like--

03:09:11.604 --> 03:09:12.747
LAURA: I mean, I <i>have</i> paints I guess.

03:09:12.747 --> 03:09:14.270
MATT: But you have paints to do it.

03:09:14.270 --> 03:09:15.527
LAURA: Okay, I'll paint it with the stuff I have.

03:09:15.527 --> 03:09:16.717
MATT: You paint her a little picture.

03:09:16.717 --> 03:09:20.908
LAURA: Ooh, colored inks? I didn't realize that!

03:09:20.908 --> 03:09:22.803
MARISHA: Gel pens!

03:09:22.803 --> 03:09:24.973
MATT: (clicking)

03:09:24.973 --> 03:09:27.047
LAURA: Ooh.

03:09:27.047 --> 03:09:32.829
MATT: Postage for sending it off is simple enough
at that size to be about five silver from here to

03:09:32.829 --> 03:09:34.410
Nicodranas.

03:09:34.410 --> 03:09:35.399
LAURA: Okay.

03:09:35.399 --> 03:09:41.360
TALIESIN: I think we should be careful, because
the longer we're in town, the more people we talk

03:09:41.360 --> 03:09:44.313
to, the more people might decide that they're
invested in us staying.

03:09:44.313 --> 03:09:47.105
TRAVIS: Fair enough. We'll keep our eyes open. To
Dolan's then.

03:09:47.105 --> 03:09:49.262
MATT: To Dolan's first?

03:09:49.262 --> 03:09:50.335
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:09:50.335 --> 03:09:52.194
MARISHA: You guys go to Dolan's. You want to take
a field trip?

03:09:52.194 --> 03:09:53.619
LIAM: Yeah.

03:09:53.619 --> 03:09:54.822
TRAVIS: Where are y'all going?

03:09:54.822 --> 03:09:58.471
LIAM: We have to take a trip to Pumat's for
supplies and then--

03:09:58.471 --> 03:10:04.464
TRAVIS: Insight check! Just kidding. I'm good.

03:10:04.464 --> 03:10:05.674
MATT: All right. Who's going where?

03:10:05.674 --> 03:10:08.977
MARISHA: I go wherever Caleb goes.

03:10:08.977 --> 03:10:10.293
SAM: Me, too.

03:10:10.293 --> 03:10:11.488
LIAM: Pumat, library.

03:10:11.488 --> 03:10:13.663
MATT: Pumat, library. The rest of you guys are
going to Dolan's?

03:10:13.663 --> 03:10:15.695
TALIESIN: To Dolan's. We'll meet up at Pumat's.

03:10:15.695 --> 03:10:20.421
MARISHA: Okay. That sounds good. You guys,
Dolan's; we'll go library.

03:10:20.421 --> 03:10:24.181
LIAM: We'll do library first. Then we'll pull
Matt.

03:10:24.181 --> 03:10:25.462
MARISHA: We'll pull Matt.

03:10:25.462 --> 03:10:26.775
TALIESIN: We can pull Matt's soul.

03:10:26.775 --> 03:10:28.149
MARISHA: Pull Matt Key.

03:10:28.149 --> 03:10:29.714
MATT: So. As you guys--

03:10:29.714 --> 03:10:34.142
LIAM: (silly voice) Hey, you got your chocolate in
my peanut butter!

03:10:34.142 --> 03:10:45.040
MATT: As you guys exit the Pillow Trove, and you
make your way outside of the Tri-Spires, the first

03:10:45.040 --> 03:10:48.675
thing of note is the tone and the mood of the city
has shifted dramatically.

03:10:48.675 --> 03:10:49.684
MARISHA: Fuck!

03:10:49.684 --> 03:10:52.202
SAM: It's a more festive atmosphere?

03:10:52.202 --> 03:10:54.247
LIAM: It's a party, girl.

03:10:54.247 --> 03:11:01.858
MATT: No. First things first. The skies are gray.
What little bits of sunlight came through the last

03:11:01.858 --> 03:11:13.772
day have completely absconded. The sky is covered
in gray, nearly stormy clouds. There is an air of

03:11:13.772 --> 03:11:20.051
stress and question in the streets as you start
seeing Righteous Brand groups making their way

03:11:20.051 --> 03:11:27.025
through. As you make your way through the north
side of the Pentamarket, one of the town criers

03:11:27.025 --> 03:11:33.224
comes by shouting, "War declared on the Kryn by
the King in retribution of attack on eastern

03:11:33.224 --> 03:11:34.407
"garrisons!"

03:11:34.407 --> 03:11:35.695
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

03:11:35.695 --> 03:11:41.790
MATT: Another one, a few moments later further
down the way shouts out, "Righteous Brand

03:11:41.790 --> 03:11:47.828
"mobilizing east to protect our families! Spare
what provisions you can to ensure victory and

03:11:47.828 --> 03:11:59.170
"support our defenders!" There are clusters of
Righteous Brand groups, the full armored military

03:11:59.170 --> 03:12:05.102
outside of the Signet Wall that have come into the
streets and are basically picking up provisions,

03:12:05.102 --> 03:12:09.443
asking for donations from anyone that can spare
things for this scenario. They're grabbing horses

03:12:09.443 --> 03:12:18.508
from nearby stables, and it seems like since the
close of the festival, through the night and into

03:12:18.508 --> 03:12:22.961
the morning, preparations have already kicked in
on the military side.

03:12:22.961 --> 03:12:25.429
TRAVIS: Maybe not to Dolan's, then.

03:12:25.429 --> 03:12:26.943
LAURA: Why?

03:12:26.943 --> 03:12:28.894
TRAVIS: Because we got to get the fuck out of
here.

03:12:28.894 --> 03:12:34.777
LAURA: Well, are we still all together, or are we
already split up?

03:12:34.777 --> 03:12:36.078
MATT: You're already split up.

03:12:36.078 --> 03:12:40.444
LAURA: There's no way we'll be able to get out of
here before--

03:12:40.444 --> 03:12:41.837
MARISHA: Back to Pumat's.

03:12:41.837 --> 03:12:45.456
TALIESIN: We're going to do our best. We're going
to see how it's going to be.

03:12:45.456 --> 03:12:46.678
LIAM: Did we hear that, though?

03:12:46.678 --> 03:12:48.611
MARISHA: I'm assuming we all heard it as we
split.

03:12:48.611 --> 03:12:53.138
MATT: You heard bits of it as you split off. You
guys heard a bit. It says, "Crick incursion

03:12:53.138 --> 03:12:58.083
"threatening imperial borders! The Starosta
recommends armed escorts for travel across the

03:12:58.083 --> 03:13:07.416
"valley!" A lot of these Righteous Brand soldiers
are also saying goodbye to their families. There's

03:13:07.416 --> 03:13:14.551
a lot of people in big embraces with their
children or with their parents, and there's very

03:13:14.551 --> 03:13:23.335
much the air of the morning before the big shift
begins. The Crownsguard themselves are doing the

03:13:23.335 --> 03:13:28.902
best to keep the peace and inform people and not
keep individuals from freaking out as much, but

03:13:28.902 --> 03:13:32.296
you do see a few arguments breaking out in the
streets and there's that general tension of,

03:13:32.296 --> 03:13:36.032
"What's happening? What's going on? How bad is
this?" But everything seems relatively under

03:13:36.032 --> 03:13:44.382
control. The Signet Wall, which is to the north
side of the city, which is where all the military

03:13:44.382 --> 03:13:49.126
is usually situated-- you don't have a view beyond
the wall, of course, but you can see that's where

03:13:49.126 --> 03:13:54.706
a large part of the Righteous Brand is emerging
into the city from. Yeah, there is a definite

03:13:54.706 --> 03:14:02.587
building presence, and tension in the city in
preparation for the shift eastward. You guys are

03:14:02.587 --> 03:14:04.030
heading to Dolan's still?

03:14:04.030 --> 03:14:05.531
LAURA: Are we still?

03:14:05.531 --> 03:14:06.663
MATT: Or what are you doing?

03:14:06.663 --> 03:14:10.988
LAURA: I mean, it's obvious we're at war now.
There's not much to talk to him about, huh?

03:14:10.988 --> 03:14:12.183
TRAVIS: That's what I mean.

03:14:12.183 --> 03:14:17.140
LAURA: Maybe we should see if we should be some
armed guards for some rich people going across the

03:14:17.140 --> 03:14:19.692
valley before, so that we have, you know.

03:14:19.692 --> 03:14:23.643
TALIESIN: Just a thought to check the board; also
get our stuff from the Leaky Tap.

03:14:23.643 --> 03:14:26.777
LAURA: Yeah, that's what we can do while they're
at the library.

03:14:26.777 --> 03:14:28.618
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:14:28.618 --> 03:14:29.708
ASHLEY: That's a good idea.

03:14:29.708 --> 03:14:31.565
MATT: You guys are heading back to the Leaky Tap?

03:14:31.565 --> 03:14:34.709
LAURA: We're going to go by the board first. The
job board?

03:14:34.709 --> 03:14:35.918
MATT: Oh, the Taskboard.

03:14:35.918 --> 03:14:39.872
LAURA: To see about being armed guards, and then
we're going to go to the--

03:14:39.872 --> 03:14:44.230
TALIESIN: Possible private escorts. Private
escort, either north or--

03:14:44.230 --> 03:14:47.370
MARISHA: Might be our best way out of town,
actually. Good idea.

03:14:47.370 --> 03:14:54.176
MATT: Okay. You guys head to the Taskboard outside
of the King's Hall, the four of you. There's the

03:14:54.176 --> 03:14:58.650
original posting "Seeking or paying for any
information on Myriad or unlawful activity within

03:14:58.650 --> 03:15:07.129
"the city." There's the reward on rebel gatherings,
anti-crown rhetoric that you've seen. There is a

03:15:07.129 --> 03:15:17.365
shift to the recent Righteous Brand convincing
letter. It says, "War has found our doorstep.

03:15:17.468 --> 03:15:21.640
"Defend your family from the Xhorhasian hordes by
sword or shield. Good pay and adventurous living

03:15:21.640 --> 03:15:26.854
"as a soldier of the Righteous Brand. Seek Leopold
Wanstiker at the Marrow Keep in the Signet Wall."

03:15:26.854 --> 03:15:33.310
The other "Proof of others' worship of heretical
gods paid in gold." You don't see any immediate

03:15:33.446 --> 03:15:37.646
postings for armed guards but those are probably
done privately through the merchant guilds.

03:15:37.646 --> 03:15:47.157
However, as you're looking at the board a voice
goes: "Oh, well that's perfect!" You see

03:15:47.157 --> 03:15:52.938
Voloshin, the Keeper of the Hall who you had
previously interfaced with when you did your job

03:15:52.938 --> 03:15:58.699
in the sewers, comes out in his robes and he says,
"We'd actually sent a page to look for you but

03:15:58.699 --> 03:16:05.419
"they must've missed you. The Lawmaster wishes to
speak with you, would you come with me?"

03:16:05.419 --> 03:16:08.080
TRAVIS: Of course.

03:16:08.080 --> 03:16:09.884
LAURA: Yeah, of course we will.

03:16:09.884 --> 03:16:10.777
TALIESIN: Sure.

03:16:10.777 --> 03:16:16.706
MATT: "Providence it is. Enter, please." He leads
you inside the hall of the king and there are the

03:16:16.752 --> 03:16:25.947
two archways between the clerk's center and the
Lawbearer's small shrine within the chamber. He

03:16:25.947 --> 03:16:29.389
leads you down the right hallway past two sets of
doors and there's a third door on the right that

03:16:29.389 --> 03:16:41.777
is partially ajar. As you enter it, you see a
spacious if rather minimalistic chamber. It's a

03:16:41.777 --> 03:16:49.746
bare chamber beyond a bookcase, the desk, with a
long bench in front of it, and a series of three

03:16:49.746 --> 03:16:52.815
small windows where the sunlight comes through--
or the light, there's not really sunlight at the

03:16:52.815 --> 03:17:00.199
moment because of the weather. Beyond that, it's
white marble and fairly empty. There at the desk

03:17:00.199 --> 03:17:05.904
you see, her arms sprawled looking down over
clusters of parchments, the Lawmaster Orentha

03:17:05.904 --> 03:17:13.399
Stonegrasp. Her gray hair has tumbled past her
shoulders and her bangs have been pulled back like

03:17:13.399 --> 03:17:20.276
a natural circlet, keeping it out of her eyes. He
pushes you into the chamber, she has a dark brown fur

03:17:20.276 --> 03:17:25.222
robe on. The cold morning air makes the room,
especially the dark marble, very cold. She keeps

03:17:25.222 --> 03:17:32.192
it on for warmth. She looks up from the papers and
greets you with a smile and goes, "Thank you for

03:17:32.192 --> 03:17:40.126
"coming. That was mighty fast. Have a seat, if you
don't mind. Thank you, Voloshin, close the door,

03:17:40.126 --> 03:17:47.242
"if you could." "Of course, my dear." He closes the
door, leaves you in there. "I wasn't expecting

03:17:47.242 --> 03:17:52.113
"such a rapid response, but I appreciate your
expediency."

03:17:52.113 --> 03:17:53.371
LAURA: Well, we were right here.

03:17:53.371 --> 03:17:58.225
MATT: "That's fantastic. Please, have a seat. I'd
like to discuss a few things with you if you don't

03:17:58.225 --> 03:18:10.807
"mind. First off, congratulations yesterday. That
was quite a display and a fantastic victory. Well--"

03:18:10.807 --> 03:18:12.839
LAURA: Are we going to war?

03:18:12.839 --> 03:18:21.914
MATT: "I see you are aware of the shifts in our
current imperial state of affairs. We haven't had

03:18:21.914 --> 03:18:26.398
"war in generations. I'm hopeful that the conflict
is swift, but I'll leave that concern to those

03:18:26.398 --> 03:18:35.151
"with the right expertise. I'm tasked with keeping
my people safe here, not on the front. Here. Now,

03:18:35.151 --> 03:18:39.868
"wartime puts us in an unfortunate scenario. Zadash
effectively governs the southern half of the

03:18:39.868 --> 03:18:45.850
"empire and most of military might is now leaving
us. Our Crownsguard will be stretched thin across

03:18:45.850 --> 03:18:50.759
"keeping the peace and dealing with unrest and
worry and protecting these walls from whatever

03:18:50.759 --> 03:18:55.144
"pushes through the lines of battle and the general
things that wander from beyond our boundaries.

03:18:55.144 --> 03:19:04.624
"Money isn't an issue, but personnel is. There are
outlying threats and criminals we no longer have

03:19:04.624 --> 03:19:12.453
"the manpower for and as such, the Crown has
approved an expanded mercenary budget. Now you've

03:19:12.453 --> 03:19:18.380
"already proven your ability to me twice. Most
recent, your skills in the Victory Pit showing you

03:19:18.380 --> 03:19:26.099
"capable and loyal to the king. I know not your
interest, but if you would come under contact,

03:19:26.099 --> 03:19:33.910
"under my office as legionnaires of the empire, you
would be responsible for protecting the lives of

03:19:33.910 --> 03:19:39.511
"many innocent people. Now, under contract you
would receive 15 gold a week per person as

03:19:39.511 --> 03:19:45.944
"a stipend whether or not you were on contract or
not. It could be at your leisure, months at a time

03:19:45.944 --> 03:19:52.432
"with no work and you still get paid no matter what
you do. Each assignment rewards its own bounty of

03:19:52.432 --> 03:19:59.121
"course, case by case. The work I'll be presenting
would largely involve the hunting of outstanding

03:19:59.121 --> 03:20:04.340
"criminals, the acquisition of resources that may
benefit the Empire in this time of war, and

03:20:04.340 --> 03:20:12.018
"sometimes the extermination of dangerous creatures
that threaten life away from the front lines. Now

03:20:12.018 --> 03:20:18.059
"you'd all have credentials within the Empire and
that will grant you access to supplies, pro bono.

03:20:18.059 --> 03:20:23.088
"Access to empirical halls, and individuals
otherwise restricted to the general populace."

03:20:23.088 --> 03:20:24.734
LAURA: Would we get healing potions?

03:20:24.734 --> 03:20:30.461
MATT: "When they're available, those supplies are
a bit stretched thin and put toward the front

03:20:30.461 --> 03:20:36.939
"lines. We could probably muster what we can. Could
I hope for your help on this?"

03:20:36.939 --> 03:20:43.654
TRAVIS: That's quite the offer. Seem to be opening
up the whole kit and caboodle for us here.

03:20:43.654 --> 03:20:51.189
MATT: "Dire times make for dire circumstances. We
don't take lightly the ask that we're giving here--"

03:20:51.189 --> 03:20:58.739
TRAVIS: We understand your position, unfortunately
you find us in a precarious time. As you can see,

03:20:58.739 --> 03:21:04.887
we don't have all of our fellows here with us and
this morning's news caught us unawares. We'd need

03:21:04.887 --> 03:21:10.610
a fair bit of time to consider your offer, I'm
afraid. We can't give you a yes or no right now.

03:21:10.610 --> 03:21:18.167
MATT: "I understand, that's fine." She smiles
lightly, the crow's nests in her eyes folding in a

03:21:18.167 --> 03:21:30.722
bit. "I hold no grudge against you should you
decline. That's all."

03:21:30.722 --> 03:21:37.357
LAURA: We do appreciate the offer and we can't
wait to talk to our friends about it, though.

03:21:37.357 --> 03:21:39.642
MATT: "Okay."

03:21:39.642 --> 03:21:41.510
SAM: Insight check.

03:21:41.510 --> 03:21:50.729
MATT: "Well, should you be interested, the first
contract I can discuss, if you choose to sign with

03:21:50.729 --> 03:21:53.150
"us. It does offer a 10,000 gold bounty."

03:21:53.150 --> 03:21:54.498
SAM: (choking)

03:21:54.498 --> 03:21:57.312
LAURA: What is it?

03:21:57.312 --> 03:21:59.751
MATT: "I can't tell you until you sign the
contract."

03:21:59.751 --> 03:22:03.136
LAURA: Why not? It sounds like a lot of money for
something, though!

03:22:03.136 --> 03:22:09.264
TRAVIS: We have sympathy for your situation. Will
you be here in a few hours if we need to return?

03:22:09.264 --> 03:22:13.620
MATT: "Oh I have no choice, I'm in the process--"
and she gestures to the papers below her and

03:22:13.620 --> 03:22:22.388
there's a stack of approval letters and reports
that have to be put out there. She's dividing what

03:22:22.388 --> 03:22:30.047
forces that she can allow to go the eastern front
and sticking her feet in the sand on what things

03:22:30.047 --> 03:22:33.070
she needs to maintain order in the city.

03:22:33.070 --> 03:22:37.389
TALIESIN: You have our deepest sympathies at your
position. This is obviously going to be a very

03:22:37.389 --> 03:22:38.579
difficult time.

03:22:38.579 --> 03:22:47.701
MATT: "Well, the issue here is that many of our
finest investigators and hunters will be sent to

03:22:47.936 --> 03:22:52.931
"the east and as such many of the criminals and
individuals that we were in the process of finding

03:22:52.931 --> 03:22:57.769
"and bringing to justice will now go free or return
and run rampant."

03:22:57.769 --> 03:23:04.147
LAURA: If only my friend were here. Me and my
friend Nott are really good at solving crimes,

03:23:04.147 --> 03:23:06.144
we're the best investigators.

03:23:06.144 --> 03:23:14.202
MATT: "Well, consider what I'm saying. At the very
least, come back and notify me."

03:23:14.202 --> 03:23:15.469
LAURA: Okay.

03:23:15.469 --> 03:23:26.151
MATT: "No harm no foul otherwise." She leans
forward and goes, "Look, I understand. People are

03:23:26.151 --> 03:23:34.908
"as varied as they are selfish. I believe in the
Empire, but I definitely don't believe with all

03:23:34.908 --> 03:23:40.995
"the people that run it. I do what I do because I
feel if I don't a lot of good people will be

03:23:40.995 --> 03:23:45.995
"crushed under the boot of those that misuse their
power. But there are good people here, and we do

03:23:45.995 --> 03:23:58.091
"what we can. I've seen the good that we can do.
That's why I'm here. I wish to fight for this land

03:23:58.091 --> 03:24:04.033
"that I call home, to protect those who cannot
protect themselves, and combat the destructiveness

03:24:04.033 --> 03:24:13.051
"and selfishness of anarchy. Utopia's impossible, I
know that, but I do what I can to make life as

03:24:13.051 --> 03:24:23.745
"livable as possible. Anyway, go speak with your
friends, and I'll be here if you need me."

03:24:23.745 --> 03:24:27.517
LAURA: Do you think the war will make it all the
way here?

03:24:27.517 --> 03:24:33.509
MATT: "If the war makes it here, then we're in far
more trouble than I anticipated."

03:24:33.509 --> 03:24:38.819
TRAVIS: Fair enough, your asks are fair. We'll
return, quickly.

03:24:38.819 --> 03:24:47.209
MATT: "Thank you. I should get back to work." She
rubs her hands and gets back down to the paper.

03:24:47.209 --> 03:24:52.715
The door opens behind and Voloshin leads you back
out of the King's Hall.

03:24:52.715 --> 03:25:02.411
LAURA: If you ever need anyone to talk to because
you feel really stressed out, I'm here. I'm a good

03:25:02.411 --> 03:25:03.863
healer, mentally.

03:25:03.863 --> 03:25:05.849
MATT: She gives a nod and a wave.

03:25:05.849 --> 03:25:08.710
TRAVIS: We turn and leave.

03:25:08.710 --> 03:25:11.671
MATT: You guys are escorted out of the King's Hall
and left back out to the streets.

03:25:11.671 --> 03:25:14.722
LAURA: Whoa, that was crazy!

03:25:14.722 --> 03:25:15.994
ASHLEY: That was crazy.

03:25:15.994 --> 03:25:17.384
TALIESIN: That's a lot.

03:25:17.384 --> 03:25:22.440
LAURA: 10,000 gold! What do you think it is? Do
you think it's a dragon or something crazy like that?

03:25:22.440 --> 03:25:24.290
TALIESIN: I think it's The Gentleman.

03:25:24.290 --> 03:25:28.236
TRAVIS: I do too, or something just as sinister.

03:25:28.236 --> 03:25:34.715
ASHLEY: I wonder if there's any way to find out
somehow what it is before accepting.

03:25:34.725 --> 03:25:38.652
LAURA: I feel like The Gentleman probably works
with the city, you guys.

03:25:38.652 --> 03:25:48.138
TALIESIN: I feel like 10,000 gold is buying an
awful lot of cooperation. More cooperation than I

03:25:48.138 --> 03:25:49.907
think I'm capable of.

03:25:49.907 --> 03:25:54.361
TRAVIS: Let's find the others and get our story
straight.

03:25:54.361 --> 03:25:57.039
LAURA: Back to The Leaky Tap, then? Get our stuff
together?

03:25:57.039 --> 03:25:58.213
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:25:58.213 --> 03:26:00.274
TALIESIN: Then we'll meet them at the shop.

03:26:00.274 --> 03:26:06.898
MATT: As you guys get to The Leaky Tap, you see
near the front door a young page wearing similar,

03:26:06.898 --> 03:26:14.296
though simpler, robes as Voloshin and members of
the King's Hall, who approaches and goes, "Oh, hi!

03:26:14.296 --> 03:26:18.630
"I'm sorry, I was sent to give you this summons
from the Lawmaster."

03:26:18.762 --> 03:26:20.869
TRAVIS: We've already been, it's all right.

03:26:20.869 --> 03:26:28.202
MATT: "Very well," and then runs off. You guys
gather your supplies and start making your way

03:26:28.202 --> 03:26:32.213
back towards the Pentamarket. The three of you,
where are you going?

03:26:32.213 --> 03:26:36.114
SAM and LIAM: The library.

03:26:36.114 --> 03:26:40.758
MATT: You make your way towards the Archive of the
Cobalt Soul here in Zadash. The same beautiful

03:26:40.758 --> 03:26:44.487
building with the large, steepled tower top.

03:26:44.487 --> 03:26:52.451
MARISHA: Button up. I turn to Nott. How do I look?
Do I have any makeup running?

03:26:52.451 --> 03:26:54.345
SAM: Do you wear makeup?

03:26:54.345 --> 03:26:56.255
MARISHA: Like once a week.

03:26:56.255 --> 03:26:58.574
SAM: I think it's worn off.

03:26:58.574 --> 03:27:01.786
MARISHA: All right, good. Let's go.

03:27:01.786 --> 03:27:05.304
SAM: Should I be--

03:27:05.304 --> 03:27:07.855
LIAM: That would be helpful.

03:27:07.855 --> 03:27:11.775
SAM: Do you think I should be more of a normie for
this?

03:27:11.775 --> 03:27:16.433
LIAM: I'm going to do the same thing that I did
the other day. I am going to cast Disguise Self

03:27:16.433 --> 03:27:21.688
and make the gigantic glasses and change my cloak
to a similar shade of blue.

03:27:21.688 --> 03:27:26.296
MARISHA: What's that thing you guys do, Mother's
Love? What's that situation?

03:27:26.296 --> 03:27:33.201
SAM: That's for when we steal things, and I
pretend to be his baby and he pretends to be my

03:27:33.201 --> 03:27:38.575
mama. Then when they're looking at the cute baby,
he steals something.

03:27:38.575 --> 03:27:42.975
MARISHA: Right. You could go with the first half
of that plan, but without the second half that

03:27:42.975 --> 03:27:44.505
involves the stealing?

03:27:44.505 --> 03:27:49.184
LIAM: They would let you bring a mother and her
baby into the library?

03:27:49.184 --> 03:27:53.377
SAM: I'll be a dwarf.

03:27:53.377 --> 03:27:56.125
MARISHA: I'm more concerned about bringing in a
man and a goblin.

03:27:56.125 --> 03:27:58.721
SAM: I can disguise myself as well.

03:27:58.721 --> 03:28:03.704
LIAM: Normally when we do Mother's Love, Nott
stabs people.

03:28:03.704 --> 03:28:09.947
MARISHA: Sure. You do know how to adjust in
certain circumstances, though, right? You do know

03:28:09.947 --> 03:28:15.082
how to improv based on the current surroundings,
though, right?

03:28:15.082 --> 03:28:17.436
LIAM: Hey, this city's under lockdown, can we go
into the library?

03:28:17.436 --> 03:28:18.624
MARISHA: Yeah, let's go.

03:28:18.624 --> 03:28:24.131
SAM: I'll cast Disguise Self and be a little
halfling girl.

03:28:24.131 --> 03:28:31.347
MATT: As you guys make your way to the front
archway of the entrance of the archive, there is

03:28:31.347 --> 03:28:37.634
the main sign-in bench, which has the large tome
that's on a small pedestal, where you sign in to

03:28:37.634 --> 03:28:45.939
enter the facility, and then you're greeted by one
of the archivists who approaches. You recognize

03:28:45.939 --> 03:28:56.891
this individual as Madeer. Has olive-colored
skin, short, dark hair, approaches with a smile.

03:28:56.891 --> 03:29:01.174
"Beauregard, you come with companions."

03:29:01.174 --> 03:29:04.655
MARISHA: I do. Spreading that Cobalt love.

03:29:04.655 --> 03:29:09.154
MATT: "Fantastic. What is it you seek this day?"

03:29:09.154 --> 03:29:21.518
LIAM: Me? I am interested in the history of the
greatest arcanists of all time.

03:29:21.518 --> 03:29:26.222
MATT: "History can be done. Arcanists can be done.
Please, do sign in here."

03:29:26.222 --> 03:29:32.531
LIAM: <i>Ja.</i> Caleb Widogast.

03:29:32.531 --> 03:29:33.843
MARISHA: That's your name.

03:29:33.843 --> 03:29:35.136
MATT: "And your friend?"

03:29:35.136 --> 03:29:37.263
SAM: Veth.

03:29:37.263 --> 03:29:41.809
TRAVIS: Ham and Beth.

03:29:41.809 --> 03:29:50.533
MATT: "No surname, very well. I will be escorting
you as well. Come." Madeer leads you into the

03:29:50.533 --> 03:29:59.159
library. For the first time you guys seeing it, it
is overwhelming. It's strange. For as much as

03:29:59.159 --> 03:30:02.764
there's a very calm, almost cathedral-like
structure on the exterior, the interior of the

03:30:02.764 --> 03:30:10.871
chambers have a curved, organic feel to the way
it's situated and organized. The bookshelves wrap

03:30:10.871 --> 03:30:17.158
around these walls, these separate antechambers
that are broken up like ventricles of a heart. In

03:30:17.158 --> 03:30:27.392
each one, it is floor to 15-foot ceiling filled
books with large shifting ladders that glide

03:30:27.392 --> 03:30:32.763
across poles and wheels. There are a number of
tables and small nooks where individuals are in

03:30:32.763 --> 03:30:39.276
the process of taking notes or reading through.
It's not super crowded. There's maybe eight other

03:30:39.276 --> 03:30:45.538
people in the facility at this time. Obviously the
city is very occupied with other things at the

03:30:45.538 --> 03:30:49.854
moment. It's not like there's a huge, constant
need for this, and the people in here are usually

03:30:49.854 --> 03:30:57.767
regulars. A lot of older folks, people who tend to
spend their later life wanting to read and learn.

03:30:57.767 --> 03:30:59.462
MARISHA: Memberships.

03:30:59.462 --> 03:31:09.395
MATT: You are led to a section. Madeer reads
through. "Arcanists, you say? Historically? Are we

03:31:09.395 --> 03:31:10.673
"talking Age of Arcanum?"

03:31:10.673 --> 03:31:18.838
LIAM: I am looking for histories, accounts of
people who pushed the boundaries of what can be

03:31:18.960 --> 03:31:32.049
done over the ages. The firsts. I am interested in
more than what is typical, at least as much as can

03:31:32.049 --> 03:31:35.320
be known. Do you follow me?

03:31:35.320 --> 03:31:37.074
MATT: "I believe so."

03:31:37.074 --> 03:31:40.665
MARISHA: He's a magic fan.

03:31:40.665 --> 03:31:46.139
LIAM: <i>Ja,</i> that is true, I am a magic fan.

03:31:46.139 --> 03:31:53.871
MARISHA: Little heavy-handed, man. Like, really
heavy-handed.

03:31:53.871 --> 03:32:00.561
MATT: A few tomes are retrieved. "This here is a
recollection of what elements of historical

03:32:00.561 --> 03:32:10.016
"significance could be pulled from the remnants of
the Age of Arcanum, pre-Calamity. There are a

03:32:10.016 --> 03:32:18.174
"great number of mages out there, though many of
them befell darker interests. But here are those

03:32:18.174 --> 03:32:28.277
"books. If you're looking for more modern mages, we
have historical information on the past 200 years

03:32:28.277 --> 03:32:33.921
"of empirical magecraft and powerful wizards in
that realm."

03:32:33.921 --> 03:32:36.870
LIAM: What about the unexplained?

03:32:36.870 --> 03:32:40.527
MATT: "Explain what you mean by 'unexplained,'
please."

03:32:40.527 --> 03:32:42.835
MARISHA: I said you were already being too
heavy-handed!

03:32:42.835 --> 03:32:53.650
LIAM: Questions. There is a certain amount of
knowledge in the schools of this empire, and then

03:32:53.650 --> 03:32:58.063
there are questions. Theorizing, philosophy of the
arcane.

03:32:58.063 --> 03:33:10.091
MATT: "That would be more Soltryce Academy
material. They do lay claim to most of those

03:33:10.091 --> 03:33:16.963
"theoretical discussions and research. The Cerberus
Assembly would be the keepers of those research

03:33:16.963 --> 03:33:19.558
"endeavors."

03:33:19.558 --> 03:33:21.407
LIAM: Excellent, I shall go there next.

03:33:21.407 --> 03:33:24.568
MATT: "I have a book here on the Cerberus
Assembly, if that would be of interest to you."

03:33:24.568 --> 03:33:25.961
LIAM: Yes.

03:33:25.961 --> 03:33:33.942
MATT: These tomes are presented to you. You can
spend time to read if you'd like. Madeer watches

03:33:33.942 --> 03:33:35.367
the entire time, like a hawk.

03:33:35.367 --> 03:33:37.498
LIAM: I start reading.

03:33:37.498 --> 03:33:39.072
MATT: Which book do you go through first?

03:33:39.072 --> 03:33:42.985
LIAM: I will start with the first, the oldest.

03:33:42.985 --> 03:33:48.441
MATT: Okay. Are you absorbing it, or are you
skimming through?

03:33:48.441 --> 03:33:54.506
LIAM: This one, I am absorbing it. I will read it
cover to cover.

03:33:54.506 --> 03:33:56.718
MATT: Cover to cover will take you the better part
of the day.

03:33:56.718 --> 03:34:01.405
LIAM: I'm a speed reader, and an average novel
takes an hour to an hour and a half for a speed

03:34:01.405 --> 03:34:02.749
reader to read.

03:34:02.749 --> 03:34:12.637
MATT: You're a speed reader, but this is also very
dense material, and it is essentially a historical

03:34:12.637 --> 03:34:18.485
theorizing on historical elements they've been
able to piece together. I'd say by the time you've

03:34:18.485 --> 03:34:21.484
gotten here, it'd be about noon in the day.

03:34:21.484 --> 03:34:23.886
LIAM: I'm holding three tomes, correct?

03:34:23.886 --> 03:34:28.602
MATT: Yes, and I'd say you'd finish this book by
about 3:00.

03:34:28.602 --> 03:34:35.853
LIAM: If I take a moment to skim, ten minutes
through each one, and get the barest idea of what

03:34:35.853 --> 03:34:37.784
I would find inside each.

03:34:37.784 --> 03:34:41.816
MATT: You want me to just tell you all the
history?

03:34:41.816 --> 03:34:46.011
LIAM: No, I'm trying to figure out if I were to
look at a couple of pages at once from three

03:34:46.011 --> 03:34:47.448
different books--

03:34:47.448 --> 03:34:52.995
MATT: What are you looking for? You have to give
me something to go on here, otherwise this is

03:34:52.995 --> 03:34:57.857
going to turn into an hour and a half of me
telling you about the history of the Age of

03:34:57.857 --> 03:34:58.913
Arcanum.

03:34:58.913 --> 03:35:02.777
LIAM: I want the furthest extent of transmutation
and changing reality.

03:35:02.777 --> 03:35:16.752
MATT: Okay. There are discussions about
transmutation on a powerful level. It involves the

03:35:16.752 --> 03:35:21.151
creation of turning mountains into mobile clouds.
It speaks of, in the Age of Arcanum, there were

03:35:21.151 --> 03:35:28.267
floating cities. There was arcane technology
utilized in that period, which was this magical

03:35:28.267 --> 03:35:34.246
utopia, but a lot of that was lost in the war,
partially because a lot of these mages, when they

03:35:34.246 --> 03:35:42.596
had developed magic to this point, weren't
satiated with their mortal capabilities, and that

03:35:42.596 --> 03:35:46.644
was when they were easily corruptible by the
betrayer gods. Then it goes into discussion of the

03:35:46.644 --> 03:35:52.664
Calamity. Magics that can alter the fabric of
reality exist out there. Some of them appear to be

03:35:52.664 --> 03:35:59.160
myth, some have been wiped from time and history
because they've been voted too dangerous and

03:35:59.160 --> 03:36:03.110
they're supposedly under lock and key in other
places of the world, if not completely eradicated

03:36:03.110 --> 03:36:06.015
because it was not fit to leave them in the hands
of mortals.

03:36:06.015 --> 03:36:07.999
LIAM: This was in one of these tomes?

03:36:07.999 --> 03:36:08.883
MATT: Yes.

03:36:08.883 --> 03:36:11.136
LIAM: Then I will focus on that, because I'm
interested in that.

03:36:11.136 --> 03:36:22.108
MATT: It speaks on theories and manipulations of--
if you're looking for things reality-based,

03:36:22.108 --> 03:36:33.111
reality's a big scope. Transmutation specifically,
most of what you can glean from this discusses the

03:36:33.111 --> 03:36:37.637
idea of turning from one creature to another,
turning from one substance to another, how they

03:36:37.637 --> 03:36:46.355
would be able to build fortresses out of stone and
then turn it to diamond for extra protective

03:36:46.355 --> 03:36:51.666
elements, and those were the great palaces of that
age.

03:36:51.666 --> 03:36:54.833
LIAM: You know my main interests. Do I find
anything of that in here?

03:36:54.833 --> 03:36:58.814
MATT: You find some discussion of it. You find
some discussion of the manipulation of time, but

03:36:58.814 --> 03:37:07.457
what minor manipulation is capable through magic
is merely to slow or expedite what happens.

03:37:07.457 --> 03:37:14.511
Accelerating time to a certain degree becomes very
dangerous, and there is talk of some mages that

03:37:14.511 --> 03:37:21.455
have attempted to reverse time in short stints,
and that process is both very taxing and in the

03:37:21.455 --> 03:37:29.330
past has completely annihilated those who toyed
with that power. It speaks specifically of two

03:37:29.330 --> 03:37:34.937
different mages who believed that they could
possibly alter choices, alter elements of their

03:37:34.937 --> 03:37:41.883
past to benefit their future, their gaining of
power and influence. One was turned to dust, the

03:37:41.883 --> 03:37:43.186
other was never seen again.

03:37:43.186 --> 03:37:46.750
LIAM: I spend all my time with that book.

03:37:46.750 --> 03:37:53.980
MARISHA: Hey, Madeer. How's it been? How's it
going?

03:37:53.980 --> 03:37:56.915
MATT: It has been frustrating, but fine.

03:37:56.915 --> 03:37:59.896
MARISHA: Fucking Zeenoth, am I right?

03:37:59.896 --> 03:38:02.842
MATT: Zeenoth is a great friend.

03:38:02.842 --> 03:38:08.853
MARISHA: No, he's a great friend! Great guy. Great
guy, that Zeenoth. Has Dairon left?

03:38:08.853 --> 03:38:14.137
MATT: I have not seen her this morning, but I
don't know if she's left or not.

03:38:14.137 --> 03:38:15.275
MARISHA: Cool, cool.

03:38:15.275 --> 03:38:20.320
MATT: You read through that tome. It's about three
in the afternoon now.

03:38:20.320 --> 03:38:27.696
MARISHA: Hey, Caleb, not going to conquer the
world in a library visit.

03:38:27.696 --> 03:38:29.993
LIAM: Can you give me two more hours?

03:38:29.993 --> 03:38:38.418
MARISHA: No, I cannot give you two more hours. I
can't. I will gouge my eyes out with a fucking

03:38:38.418 --> 03:38:41.115
pencil if I give you two more hours.

03:38:41.115 --> 03:38:44.244
SAM: How about one more hour? We'll all
compromise.

03:38:44.244 --> 03:38:46.263
LIAM: What about 30 more minutes?

03:38:46.263 --> 03:38:51.144
MARISHA: Do you have something in your neverending
flask?

03:38:51.144 --> 03:38:59.131
SAM: Of course, would you like a drink? Are we
allowed to drink in here? Why are you carrying

03:38:59.169 --> 03:39:00.774
around a cup?

03:39:00.774 --> 03:39:03.417
LIAM: I skim the book on the Cerberus Assembly.

03:39:03.417 --> 03:39:11.166
MATT: It has a breakdown of previous members who
passed away. It's basically a historical dialogue

03:39:11.166 --> 03:39:17.459
of how it was established. The name was actually a
reference to a group that existed in the Age of

03:39:17.459 --> 03:39:25.575
Arcanum. It talks about how there was a war of
mage houses 150 years ago within the empire that

03:39:25.575 --> 03:39:37.174
nearly destroyed part of the capital, Rexxentrum,
and as part of the ceasefire and the arrest of

03:39:37.174 --> 03:39:43.290
these mage houses that were at war, as opposed to
imprisoning them, they agreed to bind themselves

03:39:43.329 --> 03:39:47.096
to the empire and work for them. That's what the
Cerberus Assembly was established as: a power

03:39:47.096 --> 03:39:52.559
under rule of the king. Since then has flourished.
It's helped the kingdom rise to power, it helped

03:39:52.559 --> 03:40:00.188
them conquer the Julous Dominion. They work with
and under the king. It talks of all the members

03:40:00.188 --> 03:40:10.254
and it talks about what they do. Trent is in
there. There is Master Trent Ikithon, who is the

03:40:10.254 --> 03:40:15.998
Archmage of Civil Influence. Civil Influence is
the title and it talks about how he is the

03:40:15.998 --> 03:40:29.457
propagandist and the constructor of the face of
the Empire in upper-echelon circles. It speaks of

03:40:29.457 --> 03:40:38.189
Martinet Lunidus Da'leth who is the Archmage of
Domestic Protections, who is the oldest in the

03:40:38.273 --> 03:40:41.898
original member of the Assembly who still lives.
Was there when it was built and is currently

03:40:42.134 --> 03:40:48.951
considered the leader of the Assembly. It speaks
of Marquis Jenna Iresor who is the Archmage of

03:40:48.951 --> 03:40:57.923
Industry. One of the younger members of the
Assembly. There is Master Doolan Tversky who is

03:40:57.923 --> 03:40:59.526
the Archmage of Dysology.

03:40:59.526 --> 03:41:00.975
LIAM and MARISHA: Dysology?

03:41:00.975 --> 03:41:04.852
MATT: D-Y-S-O-L-O-G-Y. There is--

03:41:04.852 --> 03:41:06.209
SAM: Are you reading these things out loud?

03:41:06.209 --> 03:41:08.095
LAURA: Yes, he is.

03:41:08.095 --> 03:41:09.673
LIAM: I could say I'm muttering it under my
breath.

03:41:09.673 --> 03:41:17.801
MATT: There is Lord Athesias Uludan who is the
Archmage of Diplomatic Union. There is Lady Vess

03:41:17.801 --> 03:41:24.931
DeRogna who is the Archmage of Antiquity. I'll
send you these later. It's fine. I'll send you an email.

03:41:24.931 --> 03:41:28.583
TRAVIS: We now have something that rivals a
shopping episode. It's called the library.

03:41:28.583 --> 03:41:35.973
MATT: There is Headmaster Zivan Margolin who is
the Archmage of Conscription. Then there is

03:41:35.973 --> 03:41:40.085
Headmaster Oremid Hass who is the Archmage of
Cultivation. Those are the eight members

03:41:40.085 --> 03:41:41.427
currently.

03:41:41.427 --> 03:41:43.393
TRAVIS: I mean, I have to give a small golf clap
for--

03:41:43.393 --> 03:41:44.993
TALIESIN: You wrote all this?

03:41:44.993 --> 03:41:46.370
MARISHA: It's The Silmarillion.

03:41:46.370 --> 03:41:48.005
MATT: Oh, there is a lot more information!

03:41:48.005 --> 03:41:55.305
SAM: Caleb, when you were muttering there, did you
say Dolan Tversky?

03:41:55.305 --> 03:41:58.822
MATT: Doolan.

03:41:58.822 --> 03:42:01.019
TRAVIS: Not Dolan.

03:42:01.019 --> 03:42:02.092
LIAM: Similar name.

03:42:02.092 --> 03:42:06.534
MARISHA: There's nothing in this. You handed it
back, I thought there was going to be something in it.

03:42:06.534 --> 03:42:11.072
LIAM: Okay, I will say that I got my fill. I can
feel this one's radiating--

03:42:11.072 --> 03:42:13.410
MATT: Yeah, burrowing vision into your neck.

03:42:13.410 --> 03:42:21.380
LIAM: I want to stay for 17 more hours, but I'm
ready to go. I am good. I am done. Thank you.

03:42:21.380 --> 03:42:22.977
MARISHA: All right, thank you.

03:42:22.977 --> 03:42:24.640
LIAM: Thank you.

03:42:24.640 --> 03:42:27.058
MATT: "Of course! Good day."

03:42:27.058 --> 03:42:28.491
MARISHA: Thanks, Madeer.

03:42:28.491 --> 03:42:32.097
MATT: "Good to see you, Beauregard." He escorts
you out of the Archive.

03:42:32.097 --> 03:42:36.319
LIAM: Caleb looks at the thousands of books that
he did not read and leaves.

03:42:36.319 --> 03:42:38.173
MATT: Yeah, and there's a whole second level above
the spiral staircase.

03:42:38.173 --> 03:42:40.805
LAURA: And we count our fucking blessings.

03:42:40.805 --> 03:42:47.845
MARISHA: You know, you're not going to find any
answers in any of those books.

03:42:47.845 --> 03:42:51.333
LIAM: Let's go find the others.

03:42:51.333 --> 03:42:53.253
LAURA: We've already left the city.

03:42:53.253 --> 03:42:56.574
TRAVIS: We are in Rexxentrum.

03:42:56.574 --> 03:42:58.310
SAM: They're in a different campaign.

03:42:58.310 --> 03:43:03.587
MARISHA: What do you mean it's been 17 years,
Pumat? What do you mean?

03:43:03.587 --> 03:43:06.431
MATT: You guys, what have you been up to during
this time? Because it's been a number of hours.

03:43:06.431 --> 03:43:07.769
LAURA: Anything.

03:43:07.769 --> 03:43:14.184
TRAVIS: We ate like three shepherd's pies. We
fucking killed a guy and hid him in the room. We

03:43:14.184 --> 03:43:15.689
stuck him next to the skellington.

03:43:15.689 --> 03:43:17.575
LAURA: It was great.

03:43:17.575 --> 03:43:18.928
TALIESIN: We did our taxes.

03:43:18.928 --> 03:43:20.639
LAURA: Molly told all of our fortunes.

03:43:20.639 --> 03:43:21.567
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:43:21.567 --> 03:43:24.521
MATT: You've gathered all your materials. You went
and checked on your cart, which is now

03:43:24.521 --> 03:43:25.365
currently--

03:43:25.365 --> 03:43:28.315
LAURA: We just pushed the giant rotting head out
of it and left it on the street.

03:43:28.315 --> 03:43:35.084
MATT: Okay, that is a nasty fucking manticore
head. The flesh has sloughed off of it at this

03:43:35.084 --> 03:43:44.151
point. Yeah, it's pretty rough. You have your
cart, the horses are still there. The horses you

03:43:44.457 --> 03:43:45.798
had, at least.

03:43:45.798 --> 03:43:54.034
LAURA: Hey, you guys. I never used my fate thingy
yesterday because I'm stupid. Did you guys want to

03:43:54.034 --> 03:43:55.354
use it today?

03:43:55.354 --> 03:43:56.554
TRAVIS: For what?

03:43:56.554 --> 03:44:03.303
LAURA: Oh, did I not tell you about this thing? Oh
my gosh, you guys, you know the weird little thing

03:44:03.303 --> 03:44:04.513
that we stole?

03:44:04.513 --> 03:44:05.700
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

03:44:05.700 --> 03:44:11.927
LAURA: Well, it gives you this-- okay, so you
focus on it and you go to this place and you can

03:44:11.927 --> 03:44:17.351
see it and there's this little gray ball and it
goes "Touch me!" and then you go "Okay!" Then it

03:44:17.351 --> 03:44:24.639
comes out, and it goes in your chest, and you get
control of your fate for one time in a day.

03:44:24.639 --> 03:44:25.922
TRAVIS: Wow.

03:44:25.922 --> 03:44:28.295
ASHLEY: What? What do you mean you get control of
your fate?

03:44:28.295 --> 03:44:34.138
LAURA: Well, like basically like if you fuck up or
something like that then you get to fix it, maybe.

03:44:34.274 --> 03:44:37.742
ASHLEY: Can you go back and--?

03:44:37.742 --> 03:44:42.399
LAURA: No, it's like all of a sudden you feel a
little lucky, maybe.

03:44:42.399 --> 03:44:44.926
ASHLEY: Do you want to try it?

03:44:44.926 --> 03:44:47.008
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure. Why not?

03:44:47.008 --> 03:44:52.197
LAURA: Let's hide next to the body that we just
killed so that you can try it in the cellar so

03:44:52.197 --> 03:44:54.879
that nobody sees, because we should probably be
careful pulling this thing out.

03:44:54.879 --> 03:44:56.326
TALIESIN: I would imagine right now especially.

03:44:56.326 --> 03:45:02.376
LAURA: Yeah. I pull out the box. Just focus on it,
Fjord! I'll protect you!

03:45:02.376 --> 03:45:04.245
TRAVIS: Do I have to touch it or just look at it?

03:45:04.245 --> 03:45:07.729
LAURA: I can't remember. I think you just--

03:45:07.729 --> 03:45:10.506
TRAVIS: I'll do both. Are you doing it, too?

03:45:10.506 --> 03:45:11.684
ASHLEY: I'm going in?

03:45:11.684 --> 03:45:17.062
LAURA: It can only do one person in a day, but
we'll pass it around the group, so if you want

03:45:17.062 --> 03:45:20.203
it today, Fjord, then Yasha, you can do it
tomorrow.

03:45:20.315 --> 03:45:21.118
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:45:21.118 --> 03:45:22.205
TRAVIS: Sure.

03:45:22.205 --> 03:45:27.292
MATT: As you focus on it, there's nothing really
there until your hand touches it and then there's

03:45:27.292 --> 03:45:34.763
a momentary connection. You feel the thrumming of
the object, this dull heartbeat. Your vision goes

03:45:34.763 --> 03:45:43.155
tunneled until you're pulled into this space of
light and stars, distant gases and colors. There

03:45:43.155 --> 03:45:47.965
you see, beyond this brief journey, this sense of
self dissipating. At the moment where it gets a

03:45:47.965 --> 03:45:53.385
little scary and you being to lose a sense of
personal identity, you see this tiny gray mote of

03:45:53.385 --> 03:45:59.756
energy before you that's also pulsing with that
same pattern. You instinctively reach out and feel

03:45:59.756 --> 03:46:03.715
as you absorb it into yourself, and there, the
fragment of--

03:46:03.715 --> 03:46:07.800
LAURA: Did he say anything when he touched it?
Like Caleb did?

03:46:07.800 --> 03:46:08.904
MATT: Did you say anything?

03:46:08.904 --> 03:46:12.801
LAURA: Did you say anything? No, you were silent
the whole time?

03:46:12.801 --> 03:46:14.668
MATT: Your vision has come back to you and you
feel this--

03:46:14.668 --> 03:46:16.861
SAM: I'm half sea monster!

03:46:16.861 --> 03:46:19.784
TRAVIS: Was I supposed to say something?

03:46:19.784 --> 03:46:24.724
LAURA: No, it's just when Caleb did it, he was
like, "I love you, Mom and Dad!" Then he started

03:46:24.724 --> 03:46:26.059
crying.

03:46:26.059 --> 03:46:28.507
TRAVIS: Oh, no. It was a crazy trip though.

03:46:28.507 --> 03:46:29.947
LAURA: Yeah?

03:46:29.947 --> 03:46:30.949
TRAVIS: Yep.

03:46:30.949 --> 03:46:33.408
ASHLEY: Do you feel like you have control over
your fate?

03:46:33.408 --> 03:46:35.403
TRAVIS: No?

03:46:35.403 --> 03:46:37.176
TALIESIN: Do you feel...lucky?

03:46:37.176 --> 03:46:39.165
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Do you?

03:46:39.165 --> 03:46:44.670
TRAVIS: Well, I don't know.

03:46:44.670 --> 03:46:46.430
LAURA: I close up the box. I put it back in the
bag.

03:46:46.430 --> 03:46:50.600
TALIESIN: Let's go to Pumat's and let's get the
rest of them together, I'm sure by now--

03:46:50.600 --> 03:46:55.394
LAURA: We will ride the cart. Do you guys really
think we probably shouldn't become legionnaires, then?

03:46:55.394 --> 03:46:56.859
TALIESIN: No.

03:46:56.859 --> 03:46:58.587
LAURA: No? We should leave town?

03:46:58.587 --> 03:47:00.712
TALIESIN: I think we should get out of town while
the getting's good.

03:47:00.712 --> 03:47:03.061
LAURA: That lady's really nice, though. She's like
a grandma.

03:47:03.061 --> 03:47:09.798
TRAVIS: 10,000 gold, I mean, shit. Wouldn't mind
earning 10,000 and then bouncing.

03:47:09.798 --> 03:47:11.616
SAM: We're going to go to Pumat's as well.

03:47:11.616 --> 03:47:13.988
TALIESIN: You're conscripted once you start
earning that 10,000.

03:47:13.988 --> 03:47:16.203
TRAVIS: Yeah, you're conscripted as long as you
stay in town.

03:47:16.203 --> 03:47:20.709
LAURA: I wonder how the contract works? I bet it's
like a magical contract or something like that

03:47:20.709 --> 03:47:24.643
where you sign it and then they have like your
soul!

03:47:24.643 --> 03:47:29.496
TALIESIN: Or you sign it and then the next time
you come across some soldiers of the Empire, they

03:47:29.496 --> 03:47:32.244
have you executed for treason for running off on
it.

03:47:32.244 --> 03:47:33.492
LAURA: Oh, that would be bad.

03:47:33.492 --> 03:47:39.720
ASHLEY: Yeah, we should explore this idea, but
maybe.

03:47:39.720 --> 03:47:41.534
TRAVIS: Right, let's go to Pumat's.

03:47:41.534 --> 03:47:45.954
MATT: We'll say for the purposes of expediency,
and you guys lolling around a little bit to try

03:47:45.954 --> 03:47:50.016
and catch up, you all arrive at Pumat Sol's in
roughly the same time in the Pentamarket. As you

03:47:50.016 --> 03:47:59.335
enter the interior of the chamber, you can see the
three Pumats are dusting and staring off because

03:47:59.335 --> 03:48:04.275
there are currently no other people making
purchases inside. Most of the business and chaos--

03:48:04.275 --> 03:48:11.199
people dealing with the initial shock and
preparation stage of this coming scuffle with the

03:48:11.199 --> 03:48:24.105
East. As you enter, the first Pumat glances over
in your direction. "Oh, hello there! It's real

03:48:24.105 --> 03:48:28.047
"interesting morning times. What can I do for
you?"

03:48:28.047 --> 03:48:32.934
TRAVIS: Had a bit of a tussle. Guess what we're
back for?

03:48:32.934 --> 03:48:36.145
LAURA: I bet he doesn't have any more yet.

03:48:36.145 --> 03:48:38.035
SAM: Healing potions, do you have any?

03:48:38.035 --> 03:48:42.912
MATT: "Unfortunately, you guys have pretty much
cleaned me out, and what little bits I had were

03:48:42.912 --> 03:48:45.934
"snatched up bright and early this morning by the
Righteous Brand."

03:48:45.934 --> 03:48:49.004
LAURA: We should have bought some earlier! Do you
know of anyone else that would have some?

03:48:49.004 --> 03:48:56.962
MATT: "Generally, I don't like to plug rival
purveyors here in the city."

03:48:56.962 --> 03:48:59.180
LAURA: Right, but seeing as how you don't have any
inventory.

03:48:59.180 --> 03:49:04.769
MATT "There is Grace of the Wilds, which is on the
southern side of the Pentamarket. You can go ahead

03:49:04.769 --> 03:49:11.379
"and have Jasna Bree maybe help you there if the
army hasn't gotten to her first. But I digress.

03:49:11.379 --> 03:49:15.750
"Respectfully, it's going to be real difficult this
time of year."

03:49:15.750 --> 03:49:18.162
LAURA: To get healing potions?

03:49:18.162 --> 03:49:19.622
MATT: "Because we're at war."

03:49:19.622 --> 03:49:22.280
LAURA: "This time of year," like it happens every
year?

03:49:22.280 --> 03:49:26.573
MATT: "No, but I mean it's that time of year right
now apparently where war happens. That's a

03:49:26.573 --> 03:49:27.407
"problem."

03:49:27.407 --> 03:49:28.571
LAURA: Are you going to go to war, Pumat?

03:49:28.571 --> 03:49:30.478
MATT: (laughs) "No!"

03:49:30.478 --> 03:49:35.463
LAURA: But you're such a powerful person, don't
you think you would be helpful?

03:49:35.463 --> 03:49:42.190
MATT: "I don't think that's any of our fates right
now, isn't that right, boys?" They're all like,

03:49:42.190 --> 03:49:45.501
"Yeah, no that's--" "No, warfare's not my thing."

03:49:45.501 --> 03:49:51.663
TRAVIS: I know we were in here very recently. You
haven't got any overnight special deliveries of

03:49:51.663 --> 03:49:53.464
anything interesting, have you?

03:49:53.464 --> 03:50:01.074
MATT: "Unfortunately, you've taken the bulk of
what was there, other than a few odds

03:50:01.102 --> 03:50:04.349
"and ends that you couldn't afford previously."

03:50:04.349 --> 03:50:08.291
LIAM: Do you have any of that paper that I have
been purchasing so much of?

03:50:08.291 --> 03:50:10.391
MATT: "We got a little more paper, yeah."

03:50:10.391 --> 03:50:13.581
LIAM: Could I purchase, say, 200 gold worth of it?

03:50:13.581 --> 03:50:22.960
MATT: "Certainly. That can be provided. We still
have that little pearl thing, we got the

03:50:23.106 --> 03:50:30.018
"bracelets, but that's all we got at the moment.
Mister Prime back there is hard at work." He turns

03:50:30.018 --> 03:50:35.719
back and you hear this voice like, "Yeah! Got a lot
of stock to kick up now! You cleared me out for a

03:50:35.719 --> 03:50:37.498
"while, which thanks for that!"

03:50:37.498 --> 03:50:38.728
TRAVIS: You're welcome.

03:50:38.728 --> 03:50:39.949
LAURA: What was the pearl again?

03:50:39.949 --> 03:50:48.338
MATT: "Oh this here's a pearl that allows you to
go ahead and utilize your magical capabilities.

03:50:48.338 --> 03:50:58.764
"Let's see here. Yeah, you use a command word and
it allows you to regain one of your spells."

03:50:58.764 --> 03:51:01.010
SAM: How much was it?

03:51:01.010 --> 03:51:05.305
MATT: "This one runs you roughly about 350 gold
pieces."

03:51:05.305 --> 03:51:07.054
LAURA: I would like to buy that please, thank
you!

03:51:07.054 --> 03:51:08.417
MATT: "All righty, by all means."

03:51:08.417 --> 03:51:10.720
SAM: Is it one use only, and then it's gone
forever?

03:51:10.720 --> 03:51:12.028
MATT: "Once per day."

03:51:12.028 --> 03:51:14.626
TRAVIS: What was that other item you had?

03:51:14.626 --> 03:51:16.787
MATT: "Well, here you are, if you would like
to--"

03:51:16.787 --> 03:51:18.039
LAURA: Is it the Pearl of Power?

03:51:18.039 --> 03:51:19.076
MATT: It is.

03:51:19.076 --> 03:51:20.582
LAURA: I had that as Vex!

03:51:20.582 --> 03:51:27.363
MATT: "There's this enchanted shield here, which
we discussed previously. That has an enchantment

03:51:27.363 --> 03:51:33.007
"to its deflection capabilities so it will help
improve your chances of avoiding dangerous

03:51:33.007 --> 03:51:41.245
"physical contact via weaponry and other sources.
Then these here are this pair of bracers are able

03:51:41.245 --> 03:51:49.585
"to do a similar scenario given you don't have too
many types of hide or metal in the way to prevent

03:51:49.585 --> 03:51:52.126
"the enchantment from protecting you, but--"

03:51:52.126 --> 03:51:54.076
TRAVIS: Does it work with medium armor?

03:51:54.076 --> 03:51:59.845
MATT: "Well, nah, it only works if you don't have
any armor or shield."

03:51:59.845 --> 03:52:02.073
ASHLEY: Oh, what does it do?

03:52:02.073 --> 03:52:04.408
SAM: No armor, not even light armor?

03:52:04.408 --> 03:52:05.881
MATT: "Yeah, sorry."

03:52:05.881 --> 03:52:07.670
LAURA: Do you wear armor, Yasha?

03:52:07.670 --> 03:52:08.743
ASHLEY: No.

03:52:08.743 --> 03:52:09.757
TALIESIN: Oh?

03:52:09.757 --> 03:52:11.130
LIAM: Beauregard does not either.

03:52:11.130 --> 03:52:12.632
SAM: How much are those?

03:52:12.632 --> 03:52:15.043
MATT: "That one will run you back about 1,200
gold."

03:52:15.043 --> 03:52:17.005
SAM: Maybe not, forget that.

03:52:17.005 --> 03:52:18.370
TALIESIN: I don't know.

03:52:18.370 --> 03:52:20.164
ASHLEY: We'll come back for another day.

03:52:20.164 --> 03:52:22.865
SAM: Do you have any enchanted crossbow bolts?

03:52:22.970 --> 03:52:29.709
MATT: "Let me go ahead and check there for a
second, those are generally smaller-scale here.

03:52:29.709 --> 03:52:36.168
"Pumat III, if you don't mind." "I got it, already
listening to you, don't worry." He goes up a small

03:52:36.168 --> 03:52:39.947
ladder in the far corner into an attic place and
you hear some rustling around as the other Pumats

03:52:39.947 --> 03:52:46.082
are there patiently watching. "So yeah, crazy war
times, huh?"

03:52:46.133 --> 03:52:47.604
TRAVIS: How much for that shield?

03:52:47.604 --> 03:52:52.991
MATT: "Oh, this here enchanted shield will run you
about 550 gold pieces."

03:52:52.991 --> 03:52:58.853
TRAVIS: I think I'm all right.

03:52:58.853 --> 03:53:07.389
MATT: "Fair enough." About five minutes pass and
then the Pumat comes down, he's got a small, bound

03:53:07.389 --> 03:53:16.311
cluster of bolts and he goes, "Hey, so it's all we
got, but we've got a batch here of ten enchanted

03:53:16.311 --> 03:53:28.149
"crossbow bolts. These upon firing should offer a
small batch of fiery impact on whatever you strike

03:53:28.295 --> 03:53:29.710
"with them."

03:53:29.710 --> 03:53:31.217
SAM: How much are they?

03:53:31.217 --> 03:53:34.173
MATT: "For each of these, it's 50 gold per bolt."

03:53:34.357 --> 03:53:36.245
SAM: I'll take two bolts please.

03:53:36.245 --> 03:53:37.808
MATT: "Two bolts, here you go."

03:53:37.808 --> 03:53:39.102
SAM: Thank you.

03:53:39.102 --> 03:53:45.105
MATT: He passes them over to you. These bolts,
upon impact, do an additional 1d8 fire damage.

03:53:45.131 --> 03:53:46.455
SAM: Nice.

03:53:46.455 --> 03:53:49.013
MATT: You have two of them, and it's one use
only.

03:53:49.013 --> 03:53:53.335
SAM: Okay. 1d8 fire damage. Great.

03:53:53.335 --> 03:53:56.256
MATT: You may have a chance of recovering them,
depending.

03:53:56.256 --> 03:54:05.802
SAM: Okay, cool. What did we decide? Are we
leaving town or are we doing something else?

03:54:05.802 --> 03:54:13.697
TRAVIS: We got an offer to work for the city, to
be legionnaires. To protect it while its troops,

03:54:13.697 --> 03:54:19.367
hunters, and mercenaries are going to the front
lines. There are bounties of up to 10,000 gold in

03:54:19.367 --> 03:54:20.841
reward if we stay.

03:54:20.841 --> 03:54:25.192
SAM: Caleb, do we want to stay? Are there things
here that you need?

03:54:25.192 --> 03:54:35.185
LIAM: I defer to the group. I think we work well
together and whatever you think's best.

03:54:35.185 --> 03:54:36.696
MARISHA: 10,000 gold.

03:54:36.696 --> 03:54:38.744
ASHLEY: 10,000 gold is a lot of money.

03:54:38.744 --> 03:54:42.994
MARISHA: They want someone really important dead
is what it sounds like to me.

03:54:42.994 --> 03:54:44.315
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:54:44.315 --> 03:54:47.278
TALIESIN: Sounds like an expensive enemy to make.

03:54:47.278 --> 03:54:53.852
TRAVIS: Our other option being fleeing the city?
There were no postings for--

03:54:53.852 --> 03:54:56.199
LAURA: We already pushed the nasty head out of our
wagon.

03:54:56.199 --> 03:55:01.842
MARISHA: Oh. Should have done that like a week
ago. Good call. Yeah.

03:55:01.842 --> 03:55:06.200
TALIESIN: I'm legitimately happy to go in any
direction far away from the front line,

03:55:06.200 --> 03:55:07.243
personally.

03:55:07.243 --> 03:55:11.420
MARISHA: Is joining the city joining the war? Is
that what they made it sound like?

03:55:11.420 --> 03:55:12.457
TRAVIS: Believe so.

03:55:12.457 --> 03:55:14.167
TALIESIN: I think it's a slippery slope.

03:55:14.167 --> 03:55:19.742
LAURA: Joining the city is protecting the city,
more than it is joining the war.

03:55:19.742 --> 03:55:21.353
TALIESIN: It's conscription.

03:55:21.353 --> 03:55:23.253
MARISHA: The city's a part of the empire.

03:55:23.253 --> 03:55:27.178
LAURA: But you're under contract, for 15 gold a
week.

03:55:27.178 --> 03:55:36.341
LIAM: What about your interests in the Hall of
Erudition here and the Academy?

03:55:36.341 --> 03:55:37.684
TRAVIS: Oh the Soltryce?

03:55:37.684 --> 03:55:38.598
LIAM: Yeah.

03:55:38.598 --> 03:55:42.080
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'd like to see it, but I guess I'm
not in a terrible rush.

03:55:42.080 --> 03:55:46.788
LAURA: The big one's in Rexxentrum, anyway.

03:55:46.788 --> 03:55:49.859
MARISHA: I think we'll make gold wherever we go.

03:55:49.859 --> 03:55:54.217
TALIESIN: I agree. They say there's kids
disappearing up north?

03:55:54.217 --> 03:56:01.537
LAURA: If we stop by the merchants' guild we may
still be able to be armored escorts for people.

03:56:01.537 --> 03:56:03.475
SAM: Or we could just leave.

03:56:03.475 --> 03:56:04.641
LAURA: Or we could just go.

03:56:04.641 --> 03:56:09.369
MARISHA: Check by the merchants' guild, see our
options, and then make the decision from there.

03:56:09.369 --> 03:56:10.292
TRAVIS: Sure.

03:56:10.292 --> 03:56:11.240
MARISHA: All right.

03:56:11.240 --> 03:56:16.244
LIAM: You know coasting is not a bad idea either.
There is not as massive a gain, but there is not

03:56:16.244 --> 03:56:19.820
as high a risk for whatever this 10,000 gold 
target is.

03:56:20.036 --> 03:56:23.104
LAURA: Yeah, let's not do that one.

03:56:23.125 --> 03:56:24.697
LIAM: Play it safe.

03:56:24.697 --> 03:56:26.229
LAURA: Just be armored guards.

03:56:26.229 --> 03:56:29.355
MARISHA: This means we're staying together,
though?

03:56:29.355 --> 03:56:35.491
LAURA: Oh, I thought yes, that was a given right?
I mean, we all work so well together.

03:56:35.491 --> 03:56:37.633
TALIESIN: I like it.

03:56:37.633 --> 03:56:39.439
LAURA: We make really good roommates!

03:56:39.439 --> 03:56:42.355
MARISHA: We do make such good roommates.

03:56:42.355 --> 03:56:45.942
SAM: Well, Beau, do you want us to stay together?

03:56:45.942 --> 03:56:51.188
MARISHA: I think we make a good team. I think
there's more to be had here.

03:56:51.188 --> 03:56:53.445
SAM: All right.

03:56:53.445 --> 03:56:57.609
MARISHA: It might run out, who knows. I'm not an
optimist, but think there's still more to be had.

03:56:57.609 --> 03:57:01.411
TALIESIN: Do we make a polite exit at the least or
do we just bugger out?

03:57:01.411 --> 03:57:08.325
TRAVIS: She seemed pretty heartfelt, I think a
polite exit would be thoughtful.

03:57:08.325 --> 03:57:09.870
TALIESIN: I'm fair for that.

03:57:09.870 --> 03:57:13.288
MARISHA: Merchants' guild then polite exit?

03:57:13.288 --> 03:57:21.446
SAM: Yeah, maybe we'll rustle up W.C., Loo, John,
Crapper, Shitter, and Toilet.

03:57:21.446 --> 03:57:23.803
MARISHA: Oh that's right, our horsies!

03:57:23.803 --> 03:57:25.025
LAURA and MARISHA: Yeah.

03:57:25.025 --> 03:57:28.400
MATT: Any other business you want to do before you
decide to leave the city?

03:57:28.400 --> 03:57:39.333
LAURA: Did you want to swing by and see if-- Yeah,
can we pop into the other shop? The old Grace of

03:57:39.333 --> 03:57:42.225
the Wild and see if they have any healing potions,
just to check out.

03:57:42.225 --> 03:57:43.859
MATT: Okay. Yeah.

03:57:43.859 --> 03:57:45.538
TALIESIN: Just in case.

03:57:45.538 --> 03:57:47.308
SAM: In the interest of time...

03:57:47.308 --> 03:57:48.216
LAURA: Yeah.

03:57:48.216 --> 03:57:49.354
SAM: Do they have any?

03:57:49.354 --> 03:57:56.987
MATT: In the interest of time, Jasna Bree, who is
a rather eccentric woman with wild black hair, a

03:57:56.987 --> 03:58:03.084
slightly hard to follow disposition, greets you
and is like, "Hi! Welcome! Glad you could make it!

03:58:03.084 --> 03:58:13.517
"Healing potions, yes. Unfortunately kind of
already cleared out. I'm so sorry. Give me a week,

03:58:13.517 --> 03:58:16.801
"I will have a fresh batch of healing potions, and
I'd be happy to help."

03:58:16.801 --> 03:58:23.864
LAURA: Definitely be back in a week. Wait, do you
have any herbalism kits?

03:58:23.864 --> 03:58:25.845
MATT: "I do! I do!"

03:58:25.845 --> 03:58:27.655
LAURA: Oh great! Could I buy some--

03:58:27.655 --> 03:58:28.722
MATT: "I have four!"

03:58:28.722 --> 03:58:30.188
SAM: How much?

03:58:30.188 --> 03:58:33.913
MATT: "For each it's-- let me check." She goes
into her ledger.

03:58:33.913 --> 03:58:37.369
TALIESIN: The DM's Guide.

03:58:37.369 --> 03:58:38.953
MATT: Yeah, it works out well.

03:58:38.953 --> 03:58:42.366
LAURA: Would I be able to make potions of healing
with this?

03:58:42.366 --> 03:58:45.294
MATT: With herbalism kits?

03:58:45.294 --> 03:58:46.217
LAURA: Yeah.

03:58:46.217 --> 03:58:47.459
MATT: I believe you would, yes.

03:58:47.459 --> 03:58:48.269
LAURA: Okay.

03:58:48.269 --> 03:58:49.483
SAM: You can make potions of healing?

03:58:49.483 --> 03:58:51.507
MATT: Correct, it is five gold per.

03:58:51.631 --> 03:58:54.612
LAURA: Oh great. How many do you have?

03:58:54.612 --> 03:58:57.976
MATT: You have to have proficiency with it to make
a potion of healing. Are you proficient with

03:58:57.976 --> 03:58:59.361
herbalism kit?

03:58:59.361 --> 03:59:03.193
LAURA: I don't know how I would tell.

03:59:03.193 --> 03:59:04.809
MATT: It would be under your proficiencies.

03:59:04.809 --> 03:59:09.529
LAURA: Oh, then no. Oh no, I only have proficiency
with a forgery kit and a disguise kit.

03:59:09.529 --> 03:59:10.593
MATT: Sorry.

03:59:10.593 --> 03:59:12.334
LAURA: No, then fuck it! I don't want that shit!

03:59:12.334 --> 03:59:15.328
TRAVIS: I'm going to go back to Pumat's. I'm going
to buy that damn shield.

03:59:15.328 --> 03:59:23.568
MATT: Okay! There you go.

03:59:23.568 --> 03:59:25.260
TRAVIS: Thank you.

03:59:25.260 --> 03:59:28.517
SAM: If she has the materials to make acid, I'll
buy it from her.

03:59:28.517 --> 03:59:32.166
MATT: Yeah, she easily has materials and sells
them to you.

03:59:32.166 --> 03:59:34.011
TALIESIN: I couldn't make potions with alchemist
supplies, could I?

03:59:34.011 --> 03:59:44.429
MATT: Not potions. You can make poisons, acid,
various alchemical concepts, but that's the gist of it.

03:59:44.560 --> 03:59:45.710
TALIESIN: All right.

03:59:45.710 --> 03:59:47.702
MARISHA: Does she have any badass weapons? Any
badass sticks?

03:59:47.702 --> 03:59:54.251
MATT: No. She is purely a purveyor of salves and
natural remedies and--

03:59:54.251 --> 03:59:55.420
LIAM: Ointments.

03:59:55.420 --> 03:59:56.417
MATT: Yeah.

03:59:56.417 --> 03:59:57.921
LAURA: Can I ask a question?

03:59:57.921 --> 03:59:58.597
MATT: Yes.

03:59:58.711 --> 04:00:04.554
LAURA: With a healer's kit, can you heal people
when you're not in combat? Or is it just for

04:00:04.554 --> 04:00:05.599
stabilizing?

04:00:05.599 --> 04:00:12.985
MATT: The healer's kit usually can be used to
stabilize somebody. There's a feat you can take

04:00:12.985 --> 04:00:18.424
that allows you to spend an action to heal someone
with it in combat. It's called the Healer feat.

04:00:18.424 --> 04:00:20.468
Which is actually pretty cool.

04:00:20.468 --> 04:00:21.750
LAURA: Oh, okay. I'll look at that.

04:00:21.750 --> 04:00:24.113
MATT: It turns anybody into a combat healer.

04:00:24.113 --> 04:00:28.394
LAURA: Okay.

04:00:28.394 --> 04:00:33.033
SAM: Should we go say goodbye to somebody and
leave?

04:00:33.033 --> 04:00:38.577
MARISHA: Are we checking the merchants' to see if
there's any armed escort requests out of the

04:00:38.577 --> 04:00:40.449
merchants' guild?

04:00:40.449 --> 04:00:41.727
MATT: Who's helming that?

04:00:41.727 --> 04:00:42.773
SAM: Fjord!

04:00:42.773 --> 04:00:44.034
TRAVIS: Not me.

04:00:44.034 --> 04:00:45.844
LAURA: I'll do it.

04:00:45.844 --> 04:00:47.228
MATT: Make an investigation check.

04:00:47.228 --> 04:00:49.649
SAM: I'm coming with her.

04:00:49.649 --> 04:00:50.825
ASHLEY: I'll help you.

04:00:50.825 --> 04:00:54.557
LAURA: Us three. Oh. That was bad.

04:00:54.557 --> 04:00:57.284
MATT: She's helping you with it. It's advantage on
you.

04:00:57.284 --> 04:01:06.828
LAURA: Yes! (laughs) Oh no! Slightly better.
Five.

04:01:06.828 --> 04:01:16.353
MATT: You gather the knowledge of this war has
blindsided most of the merchant guilds in Zadash.

04:01:16.353 --> 04:01:23.023
Best you can tell, most of them are in the process
of getting ready to figure out what their next

04:01:23.023 --> 04:01:29.078
endeavor is. Those that would be leaving won't be
leaving for a few days. If you hang around, you

04:01:29.078 --> 04:01:30.775
may be able to pick up that kind of work.

04:01:30.775 --> 04:01:35.237
ASHLEY: Okay. That's something.

04:01:35.237 --> 04:01:43.372
LAURA: Well. I think we'd have to wait. Maybe we
should just go?

04:01:43.372 --> 04:01:49.095
ASHLEY: Should we say our goodbyes to Orentha?

04:01:49.095 --> 04:01:54.370
LAURA: We'll swing by and say, sorry we are
declining.

04:01:54.370 --> 04:02:00.809
MATT: As you guys make your way back to the King's
Hall, you are escorted back into Orentha

04:02:00.809 --> 04:02:08.576
Stonegrasp's office. "I see you've returned. I
appreciate your expediency in getting back to me."

04:02:08.576 --> 04:02:16.208
Her crackling Southern drawl breaking through with
her bright dwarven smile. "Considering what we've

04:02:16.208 --> 04:02:20.008
"discussed, what have you come to a conclusion
on?"

04:02:20.008 --> 04:02:25.961
LAURA: I think we are probably not going to be
able to help out right now.

04:02:25.961 --> 04:02:28.851
MATT: "I understand."

04:02:28.851 --> 04:02:36.053
SAM: It's not you. It's us. We're not ready for
that kind of commitment.

04:02:36.053 --> 04:02:38.567
MATT: "I understand, that's all right."

04:02:38.567 --> 04:02:43.161
SAM: You're going to make an adventuring party
very happy some day.

04:02:43.161 --> 04:02:44.422
LAURA: You really will.

04:02:44.422 --> 04:02:47.507
MATT: "I hope so. We'll send someone else after
the Hawker."

04:02:47.507 --> 04:02:48.763
LAURA: After the what?

04:02:48.763 --> 04:02:49.883
MATT: "The Hawker."

04:02:49.883 --> 04:02:52.749
LAURA: What's a Hawker?

04:02:52.749 --> 04:02:55.340
MATT: "Don't worry about it."

04:02:55.340 --> 04:02:58.906
SAM: Does anyone know what a Hawker is?

04:02:58.906 --> 04:03:07.430
LIAM: Which spelling are you using for that word?
A-W-K? O-C-K?

04:03:07.430 --> 04:03:09.315
MATT: H-A-W-K.

04:03:09.440 --> 04:03:12.157
LAURA: Like a monster or something?

04:03:12.157 --> 04:03:19.145
MATT: "No. He actually was a legionnaire for us
about five years back, but then went rogue, and we

04:03:19.145 --> 04:03:24.738
"believe had ties with the Myriad and became a
powerful tent-pole here in the Marrow Valley. We

04:03:24.738 --> 04:03:33.500
"had him cornered in Deastok about three months ago
by a team of crownsguard under the leadership of

04:03:33.500 --> 04:03:43.541
"Carlos Ventuga. But this Hawker slew Carlos and
fled south into the Wuyun Gorge and disappeared

04:03:43.541 --> 04:03:50.117
"into the Menagerie Coast. We're having to send
whoever we can to try and retrieve him and bring him

04:03:50.154 --> 04:03:51.063
"back alive."

04:03:51.063 --> 04:03:52.308
LAURA: From the Menagerie Coast?

04:03:52.308 --> 04:03:53.354
MATT: "Yes."

04:03:53.354 --> 04:03:55.197
TRAVIS: The opposite direction.

04:03:55.197 --> 04:03:59.067
LAURA: The Menagerie Coast is really freaking
cool, you guys.

04:03:59.067 --> 04:04:01.256
SAM: So many choices!

04:04:01.256 --> 04:04:03.909
LAURA: Oh shit, that sounds really cool!

04:04:03.909 --> 04:04:05.271
MATT: "If you need more time, that's fine."

04:04:05.271 --> 04:04:08.984
LAURA: What do you guys think? Hold on, can we
talk about this?

04:04:08.984 --> 04:04:10.083
TALIESIN: Quick huddle.

04:04:10.083 --> 04:04:13.342
SAM: Pros and cons.

04:04:13.342 --> 04:04:15.526
TALIESIN: I'm happy just to leave the city.

04:04:15.526 --> 04:04:19.514
LAURA: Pros, we get to visit the Menagerie Coast,
which is always really cool.

04:04:19.514 --> 04:04:22.439
TRAVIS: Pro, 10,000 gold.

04:04:22.439 --> 04:04:26.564
LAURA: Do we have a time limit on when we'd be
able to get him?

04:04:26.564 --> 04:04:33.365
MATT: "No, but the longer it takes, the easier he
probably has vanishing into the south."

04:04:33.365 --> 04:04:34.479
LAURA: Makes sense.

04:04:34.479 --> 04:04:40.986
MATT: "We sent a troupe after him about eight
weeks ago, and I fear they may not be coming back

04:04:40.986 --> 04:04:47.031
"at this point. We intended to send some of our top
investigators from the capital after this

04:04:47.162 --> 04:04:47.933
"bounty--"

04:04:47.933 --> 04:04:48.867
SAM: Investigators!

04:04:48.867 --> 04:04:49.952
LAURA: That's what they said!

04:04:49.952 --> 04:04:50.856
SAM: That's our job!

04:04:50.856 --> 04:04:51.876
LAURA: We're really good at it!

04:04:51.876 --> 04:04:56.351
MATT: "It's 10,000 gold alive, 5,000 dead."

04:04:56.351 --> 04:05:06.198
LAURA: What if we were like, let's go after this
guy, and then after that, we'll talk about being

04:05:06.198 --> 04:05:09.882
under contract? Like this can be a test
situation.

04:05:10.298 --> 04:05:13.038
MATT: "Unfortunately, if this is to happen, I need
you under contract."

04:05:13.163 --> 04:05:14.926
SAM: Do you need some tea or something?

04:05:14.926 --> 04:05:20.878
MATT: "I'm good, I appreciate your
conscientiousness."

04:05:20.878 --> 04:05:23.079
SAM: A lozenge?

04:05:23.079 --> 04:05:25.125
MATT: "I'm all right, but thank you."

04:05:25.125 --> 04:05:26.295
TALIESIN: Do you have a lozenge?

04:05:26.295 --> 04:05:27.889
SAM: I don't, I just feel bad for her.

04:05:27.889 --> 04:05:29.474
TALIESIN: Shouldn't be offering things that you
don't have.

04:05:29.474 --> 04:05:30.391
MATT: "It's fine."

04:05:30.391 --> 04:05:31.714
ASHLEY: What does the contract entail?

04:05:31.714 --> 04:05:37.435
MATT: "Retrieving this man and bringing him back
here for justice."

04:05:37.435 --> 04:05:41.527
ASHLEY: How long are we in contract with you? Just
for this, or--?

04:05:41.527 --> 04:05:46.566
MATT: "The contract has you as a legionnaire, and
as part of that you just--"

04:05:46.566 --> 04:05:47.645
SAM: Forever.

04:05:47.645 --> 04:05:49.753
MATT: "Well, until we decide to mutually end your
service."

04:05:49.753 --> 04:05:51.107
MARISHA: Mutually.

04:05:51.107 --> 04:05:55.897
MATT: "Well, if you wish out of it, we can discuss
it, it's fine. But I mean as opposed to deserting

04:05:55.897 --> 04:05:57.164
"is the problem."

04:05:57.164 --> 04:06:05.235
MARISHA: So you want to hire more legionnaires to
go kill an ex-legionnaire who wasn't legionnaire-y

04:06:05.235 --> 04:06:06.593
enough for you.

04:06:06.593 --> 04:06:09.453
LAURA: No, he ran away when he was a legionnaire.

04:06:09.453 --> 04:06:14.567
MATT: "He ran away and then allied himself, we
believe, with the Myriad and then has since, upon

04:06:14.567 --> 04:06:19.027
"attempting to bring him in, murdered some of our
finest men."

04:06:19.027 --> 04:06:20.083
MARISHA: Right.

04:06:20.083 --> 04:06:22.981
LAURA: The Myriad does some scary stuff, you
guys.

04:06:22.981 --> 04:06:25.502
TALIESIN: If we happen to bring him in even if we
weren't under contract--

04:06:25.502 --> 04:06:28.635
MATT: "Part of the bounty would still apply I'm
sure."

04:06:28.635 --> 04:06:30.137
LAURA: How much of the bounty?

04:06:30.137 --> 04:06:31.637
MATT: "Probably half."

04:06:31.637 --> 04:06:35.641
ASHLEY: That's an option.

04:06:35.641 --> 04:06:42.198
LAURA: But if we were part of the contract then we
would get access to a bunch of stuff.

04:06:42.198 --> 04:06:44.152
ASHLEY: That's true.

04:06:44.152 --> 04:06:45.511
MATT: "Think about it."

04:06:45.511 --> 04:06:47.248
SAM: Think about it.

04:06:47.248 --> 04:06:50.384
LAURA: Can we decide, can we talk about this?

04:06:50.384 --> 04:06:51.432
SAM: Huddle up again.

04:06:51.432 --> 04:06:55.877
MATT: You guys can discuss this over the next week
if you want. You don't need to decide this right now.

04:06:55.877 --> 04:06:58.449
TALIESIN: I'm too tired to make proper decisions.

04:06:58.449 --> 04:07:05.563
MATT: It's fine. "Return when you have an idea."
You're led outside and start making your way to

04:07:05.563 --> 04:07:12.902
the Leaky Tap to discuss your plan of action.
There, waiting--

04:07:12.902 --> 04:07:16.310
LAURA: This is where we hit the save point. I
don't know.

04:07:16.310 --> 04:07:25.954
MATT: As you guys head back to The Leaky Tap, the
Righteous Brand are making their way through the

04:07:25.954 --> 04:07:35.160
city. It's a weirdly solemn, unexpected military
parade essentially as they're just gathering

04:07:35.160 --> 04:07:40.407
supplies and making their way through. It's a show
of strength to help rise the spirits of people

04:07:40.407 --> 04:07:48.116
that seem confused and worried about this coming
conflict. So it does seem to calm nerves and a lot

04:07:48.116 --> 04:07:53.440
of the children seem excited to see them. Coming
down the streets on their horses and their

04:07:53.440 --> 04:08:01.967
armaments on display. While you're watching it go
by, a voice whispers up next to you and goes,

04:08:01.967 --> 04:08:13.486
"Psst, hey." You turn and you see, hood up, Kara.
"Sorry, don't mean to bother you. If you have a

04:08:13.486 --> 04:08:19.185
"moment, things are getting strange around here and
The Gentleman may have a bit of work for you."

04:08:19.185 --> 04:08:22.029
(groaning)

04:08:22.029 --> 04:08:23.713
MARISA: We're the prettiest girl in town.

04:08:23.713 --> 04:08:25.384
TALIESIN: Should have left in the middle of the
goddamn night.

04:08:25.384 --> 04:08:39.750
MATT: We'll pick up from there next week. You guys
made quite a display last night in the Victory Pit.

04:08:39.750 --> 04:08:42.600
LIAM: You just made it three times as complicated
in seven seconds.

04:08:42.600 --> 04:08:43.755
MATT: Yeah, I know.

04:08:43.755 --> 04:08:45.230
TALIESIN: Knew it was coming.

04:08:45.230 --> 04:08:52.328
MATT: Picking up on that. However, you guys do
level up. You hit level five.

04:08:52.328 --> 04:08:54.041
SAM: What does that mean?

04:08:54.041 --> 04:08:55.074
LAURA: Level five?!

04:08:55.074 --> 04:08:57.960
MATT: That means let's all roll some hit points to
finish off the evening here.

04:08:58.054 --> 04:08:58.988
MARISHA: Right now?

04:08:58.988 --> 04:08:59.789
MATT: Yeah.

04:08:59.789 --> 04:09:00.829
LAURA: Oh gosh.

04:09:00.829 --> 04:09:08.636
MATT: So we'll start over here, we'll go in order.
What'd you get, Beau?

04:09:08.636 --> 04:09:11.298
MARISHA: I rolled a seven plus three.

04:09:11.298 --> 04:09:12.319
MATT: There you go.

04:09:12.319 --> 04:09:13.818
MARISHA: Wait, right?

04:09:13.818 --> 04:09:15.307
MATT: Whatever your constitution modifier is.

04:09:15.307 --> 04:09:18.588
MARISHA: Plus three, yeah.

04:09:18.588 --> 04:09:21.229
MATT: Ten extra hit points to Beau. What'd you
get, Nott?

04:09:21.354 --> 04:09:22.504
SAM: I roll a d8?

04:09:22.504 --> 04:09:23.567
MATT: Roll a d8.

04:09:23.567 --> 04:09:24.512
SAM: I got a seven.

04:09:24.512 --> 04:09:25.670
MATT: Nice!

04:09:25.670 --> 04:09:27.088
TRAVIS: Everybody rolls a d8?

04:09:27.088 --> 04:09:46.304
MATT: I believe for a warlock it's also a d8.
Caleb is a d6, he's the only one. Warlock is a d8,

04:09:46.304 --> 04:09:47.887
but it adds a plus.

04:09:47.887 --> 04:09:49.234
LIAM: I rolled a four.

04:09:49.234 --> 04:09:50.352
MATT: What'd you get?

04:09:50.352 --> 04:09:51.811
LIAM: Four, plus I've a constitution modifier.

04:09:51.811 --> 04:09:54.082
TRAVIS: It was a d8?

04:09:54.082 --> 04:09:55.358
MATT: d8, yeah.

04:09:55.358 --> 04:09:57.939
TRAVIS: Six plus four, ten.

04:09:57.939 --> 04:09:58.985
MATT: Nice.

04:09:58.985 --> 04:10:01.580
LAURA: Oh I'm rolling an eight as well?

04:10:01.580 --> 04:10:04.853
MATT: You are as a cleric, yes.

04:10:04.853 --> 04:10:06.227
LAURA: Five.

04:10:06.227 --> 04:10:11.663
MATT: Five, okay. d10 for you.

04:10:11.663 --> 04:10:14.750
TALIESIN: d10 for me. Six.

04:10:14.750 --> 04:10:16.579
MATT: You guys are all rolling above average, nice.

04:10:16.579 --> 04:10:17.557
ASHLEY: d12?

04:10:17.720 --> 04:10:18.919
MATT: d12 for you.

04:10:18.919 --> 04:10:21.553
ASHLEY: Nice. 11?

04:10:21.553 --> 04:10:24.245
MATT: Shit, you guys rolled really good this time,
well done!

04:10:24.245 --> 04:10:26.156
ASHLEY: Plus two?

04:10:26.156 --> 04:10:32.662
MATT: It'll be your constitution modifier, so a
plus two to that for 13 hit points. So add 11 and

04:10:32.662 --> 04:10:35.191
it should give you 13.

04:10:35.191 --> 04:10:40.941
LAURA: Oh it'll go. Here, let me get-- Over on
this side, you can manage your levels.

04:10:40.941 --> 04:10:43.109
ASHLEY: That's right.

04:10:43.109 --> 04:10:52.543
MATT: For Molly, Beau, and Yasha, that means your
attack action now does two attacks. You get an

04:10:52.543 --> 04:11:03.639
extra ki point. Casters all get level three
spells. That's pretty great. And your proficiency

04:11:03.639 --> 04:11:12.849
bonus goes up by one. So all your proficient
skills, proficient attacks, spell DCs, and spell

04:11:12.849 --> 04:11:16.828
attack modifiers all go up by one. I think it's
all going to be included in there already, in the

04:11:16.828 --> 04:11:20.236
app. It's a good level.

04:11:20.236 --> 04:11:25.223
TALIESIN: I add six to the rolled HP?

04:11:25.223 --> 04:11:27.356
MATT: Correct.

04:11:27.356 --> 04:11:28.428
TALIESIN: All right.

04:11:28.428 --> 04:11:30.462
LIAM: What's everybody's hit points at, what are
the new totals?

04:11:30.462 --> 04:11:33.391
MATT: Beau also gets Stunning Strike.

04:11:33.391 --> 04:11:34.828
MARISHA: 44.

04:11:34.828 --> 04:11:37.743
LAURA: My hit points are super low, you guys.

04:11:37.743 --> 04:11:40.004
SAM: What's Uncanny Dodge?

04:11:40.137 --> 04:11:41.811
LIAM: The best thing ever.

04:11:41.811 --> 04:11:44.337
LAURA: He got Uncanny Dodge.

04:11:44.337 --> 04:11:55.187
SAM: Sneak attack bonus 3d6! Oh shit. All the
dice.

04:11:55.187 --> 04:11:59.424
MATT: This is my favorite part. Watching people
realize what they get when they level up.

04:11:59.424 --> 04:12:05.438
TALIESIN: Oh wait, I get a bunch of weird shit,
we're going to have to have a talk.

04:12:05.438 --> 04:12:08.826
SAM: You can use your reaction to halve the
attack's damage against you?!

04:12:08.939 --> 04:12:09.767
MATT: Yep.

04:12:09.767 --> 04:12:14.599
SAM: Holy shit. I'm unstoppable!

04:12:14.599 --> 04:12:21.267
MATT: That's part of the reason that Vax survived
so much in the last campaign.

04:12:21.267 --> 04:12:24.995
LAURA: I think I get Revivify now.

04:12:24.995 --> 04:12:32.273
SAM: Can I use that once a day? Once a round?

04:12:32.273 --> 04:12:34.133
MATT: No, it's just your reaction, once a round.

04:12:34.133 --> 04:12:35.549
SAM: Once a round?!

04:12:35.549 --> 04:12:36.733
MATT: Yeah.

04:12:36.733 --> 04:12:41.996
SAM: Holy shit. I'm a golden god.

04:12:41.996 --> 04:12:47.525
TALIESIN: I get a new blood curse. I want to have
a conversation about that before we go into that.

04:12:47.525 --> 04:12:52.693
MATT: Yes, you do get another blood curse, you get
to choose.

04:12:52.693 --> 04:12:55.541
LAURA: I have Dispel Magic you guys!

04:12:55.580 --> 04:12:56.867
SAM: So does Yasha, no big deal.

04:12:56.867 --> 04:12:59.098
ASHLEY: No, that's a big deal.

04:12:59.098 --> 04:13:10.739
MATT: Then you get, of course, 3rd-level spells,
and you get another invocation. You can mess with

04:13:10.739 --> 04:13:11.877
it later.

04:13:11.877 --> 04:13:16.458
LIAM: Where we're leaving off, are we going to
come back? Because it's the end of the day, are we

04:13:16.458 --> 04:13:19.528
going to come back at the end of the day or are we
going to come back next morning?

04:13:19.528 --> 04:13:25.625
MATT: It's late afternoon at this point. You guys
are coming back right as you met with Kara there.

04:13:25.625 --> 04:13:29.131
LAURA: Great, so you can go back to the library
next time.

04:13:29.131 --> 04:13:31.092
MARISHA: (chanting) Level five, level five.

04:13:31.092 --> 04:13:41.974
MATT: Yasha, your speed increases by ten, which is
nice. That's some fun stuff. We'll leave it there

04:13:41.974 --> 04:13:48.489
and we'll pick up next week in this pre-war chaos.
Guys, thank you so much for hanging with us. I

04:13:48.489 --> 04:13:52.888
hope you had a good time. We had a good time.
We'll be back next Thursday, see where this goes

04:13:52.888 --> 04:13:58.016
as choices, paths, avenues, and possibilities all
begin to arise.

04:13:58.016 --> 04:14:00.555
LAURA: (singing) Too many options.

04:14:00.555 --> 04:14:04.320
LIAM: They're engrossed in leveling up. This is
the joy of Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

04:14:04.320 --> 04:14:12.221
TALIESIN: I'm excited to see what insane shit I can
do. My proficiency bonus, did it automatically go up?

04:14:12.341 --> 04:14:13.828
MATT: Yeah, it automatically puts it up.

04:14:13.828 --> 04:14:15.559
LAURA: Holy shit, you have so many hit points.

04:14:15.559 --> 04:14:19.481
MARISHA: I want to go to Taco Bell on the last 45
minutes of my birthday.

04:14:19.481 --> 04:14:21.334
MATT: Okay, let's do it. Happy birthday.

04:14:21.334 --> 04:14:22.606
MARISHA: 45 minutes.

04:14:22.606 --> 04:14:25.893
MATT: I love you, we're going to get Taco Bell.

04:14:25.893 --> 04:14:28.838
TALIESIN: That is the best birthday meal.

04:14:28.838 --> 04:14:34.482
MATT: I think so. All right guys, thank you so
much, we'll see you next week. We love you, and is

04:14:34.482 --> 04:14:37.560
it Thursday yet? Good night.

04:14:37.560 --> 04:27:19.315

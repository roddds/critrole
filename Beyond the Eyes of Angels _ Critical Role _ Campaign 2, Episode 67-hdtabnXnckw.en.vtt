00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.615
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to

2
00:00:01.615 --> 00:00:03.657
tonight's episode of Critical Role,

3
00:00:03.657 --> 00:00:05.580
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

4
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.294
really mess with me right before we go live--

5
00:00:07.294 --> 00:00:08.127
LIAM: (laughs)

6
00:00:08.127 --> 00:00:09.665
MATT: --and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

7
00:00:09.665 --> 00:00:11.915
TRAVIS: We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

8
00:00:12.918 --> 00:00:14.431
SAM: Boy oh, boy.

9
00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:15.431
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

10
00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.167
MATT: Before we get into tonight's game,

11
00:00:18.167 --> 00:00:20.688
we have a few announcements to get through.

12
00:00:20.688 --> 00:00:22.635
First and foremost, our first of two sponsors

13
00:00:22.635 --> 00:00:24.219
for the evening, our returning friend

14
00:00:24.219 --> 00:00:26.616
through all of campaign two, D&amp;D Beyond.

15
00:00:26.616 --> 00:00:28.075
(cheering)

16
00:00:28.075 --> 00:00:31.229
SAM: (sighing) D&amp;D Beyond.

17
00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:33.410
There was a bit of a revelation last week

18
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.014
that has shaken my campaign to its very foundations.

19
00:00:37.014 --> 00:00:38.465
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

20
00:00:38.465 --> 00:00:40.684
SAM: I've been a little distraught

21
00:00:40.684 --> 00:00:42.236
and distracted this week.

22
00:00:42.236 --> 00:00:45.223
D&amp;D Beyond wants me to mention that they're hiring again.

23
00:00:45.223 --> 00:00:48.210
They're looking for a digital marketing manager,

24
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.581
a full stack developer, and a mobile app developer.

25
00:00:51.581 --> 00:00:53.183
Apply now on their website.

26
00:00:53.183 --> 00:00:57.717
But I've been too depressed to really think about

27
00:00:57.717 --> 00:01:00.721
being funny for them this week.

28
00:01:00.721 --> 00:01:02.625
I didn't write anything.

29
00:01:02.625 --> 00:01:03.800
There's no-- there's no joke.

30
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.346
I'm not a trained monkey.

31
00:01:05.346 --> 00:01:07.897
I can't just perform for you people.

32
00:01:07.897 --> 00:01:10.955
So while I reassess my campaign,

33
00:01:10.955 --> 00:01:13.567
I'm going to suspend it for a little while

34
00:01:13.567 --> 00:01:16.549
while I take stock of things.

35
00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.537
Luckily a few weeks, maybe months ago,

36
00:01:19.537 --> 00:01:22.312
we had prepared for just such an event like this

37
00:01:22.312 --> 00:01:24.615
where I didn't write a bit.

38
00:01:24.615 --> 00:01:29.423
We pre-shot sort of a generic ad for D&amp;D Beyond

39
00:01:29.423 --> 00:01:31.794
in the event that something tragic happened to me

40
00:01:31.794 --> 00:01:35.540
and I couldn't be here, they would have it ready to play.

41
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.408
We're just going to use that one tonight.

42
00:01:37.408 --> 00:01:39.649
It won't make much sense, but play that video.

43
00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:41.526
It's a generic D&amp;D Beyond spot.

44
00:01:41.526 --> 00:01:43.313
TRAVIS: Play the tragic ad.

45
00:01:43.313 --> 00:01:44.146
SAM: Hello.

46
00:01:44.146 --> 00:01:46.056
If you're seeing this video, it is because I,

47
00:01:46.056 --> 00:01:48.757
Sam Riegel, am no longer alive.

48
00:01:48.757 --> 00:01:51.083
I assume I passed away like I always imagined,

49
00:01:51.083 --> 00:01:53.699
shirtless with ripped abs riding a jet-ski

50
00:01:53.699 --> 00:01:55.985
into a volcano while blasting Ozzy Osbourne's

51
00:01:55.985 --> 00:01:58.882
classic hit, "The Crazy Train."

52
00:01:58.882 --> 00:02:00.888
I also assume that my funeral was attended by

53
00:02:00.888 --> 00:02:04.136
thousands of weeping fans, the entire cast of

54
00:02:04.136 --> 00:02:07.421
Saturday Night Live, Kate Middleton, Meghan Markle,

55
00:02:07.421 --> 00:02:09.209
and I was lowered into the ground while blasting

56
00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.488
Ozzy Osbourne's classic hit, "The Crazy Train."

57
00:02:13.488 --> 00:02:15.572
It truly is a sad, sad day, but even though

58
00:02:15.572 --> 00:02:18.183
my life has ended, my responsibilities

59
00:02:18.183 --> 00:02:20.222
to our sponsor live on.

60
00:02:20.222 --> 00:02:23.785
So while an appropriate replacement for me is found,

61
00:02:23.785 --> 00:02:27.646
I shot this ad for D&amp;D Beyond to bridge the gap.

62
00:02:27.646 --> 00:02:31.755
Please cast, stop sobbing uncontrollably for one moment

63
00:02:31.755 --> 00:02:35.282
so that these important words may be heard.

64
00:02:35.282 --> 00:02:37.229
(more chipper) D&amp;D Beyond is an amazing way to improve

65
00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:38.720
your D&amp;D gameplay.

66
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.663
Keep your character stats, monster info,

67
00:02:40.663 --> 00:02:42.321
gear and weapons right in front of you

68
00:02:42.321 --> 00:02:44.652
on your laptop or tablet while you play.

69
00:02:44.652 --> 00:02:47.180
And check out their new encounter builder alpha,

70
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.751
available to all D&amp;D Beyond subscribers.

71
00:02:49.751 --> 00:02:53.330
You can visit and download their app at dndbeyond.com.

72
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.697
(serious) Okay, you may resume crying now.

73
00:02:56.697 --> 00:03:00.231
Before I go, there's one more thing I'd like to settle.

74
00:03:00.231 --> 00:03:03.315
I, Sam Riegel, being of sound mind and body,

75
00:03:03.315 --> 00:03:07.014
hereby leave the following as my last will and testament.

76
00:03:07.014 --> 00:03:10.208
To Matt, I leave my t-shirt collection

77
00:03:10.208 --> 00:03:13.496
on the condition that he wear them and never destroy them.

78
00:03:13.496 --> 00:03:15.115
It is my dying wish.

79
00:03:15.115 --> 00:03:18.221
To Laura, I leave my dice, because really,

80
00:03:18.221 --> 00:03:20.453
who gives a shit about dice?

81
00:03:20.453 --> 00:03:24.485
To Ashley, Liam, and Marisha, I leave you my flasks

82
00:03:24.485 --> 00:03:27.308
since you guys love to drank.

83
00:03:27.308 --> 00:03:31.261
To Taliesin, I leave my collection of cars and motorcycles,

84
00:03:31.261 --> 00:03:34.900
my furs, the broaches, my wine collection,

85
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.056
my exotic birds, the piece of the true cross,

86
00:03:38.056 --> 00:03:41.287
my Amazing Fantasy #15 mint-condition comic book,

87
00:03:41.287 --> 00:03:45.704
my rare butterflies, and $650,000 in cash and jewelry.

88
00:03:46.645 --> 00:03:48.016
I think that's everyone.

89
00:03:48.016 --> 00:03:51.662
Oh, wait, I forgot Dani Carr.

90
00:03:51.662 --> 00:03:52.997
She gets my dice.

91
00:03:52.997 --> 00:03:56.192
Take them away from Laura and give them to Dani.

92
00:03:56.192 --> 00:03:58.849
And please remember me forever as a happy,

93
00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:02.210
carefree person, but more important,

94
00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.530
remember to check out dndbeyond.com.

95
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.274
Suck an egg, Travis.

96
00:04:07.274 --> 00:04:11.423
Matt, on with the show.

97
00:04:11.423 --> 00:04:15.698
(solemn music)

98
00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:19.295
(laughter)

99
00:04:19.295 --> 00:04:21.545
SAM: I'm sorry. I'm sorry, guys.

100
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:23.521
That's all I have this week.

101
00:04:23.521 --> 00:04:25.594
Matt, over to you.

102
00:04:25.594 --> 00:04:28.728
(groaning)

103
00:04:28.728 --> 00:04:31.899
SAM: Oh, sorry, you guys weren't supposed to see that.

104
00:04:31.899 --> 00:04:33.381
You guys weren't supposed to see that piece

105
00:04:33.381 --> 00:04:35.678
until after I died, so I apologize

106
00:04:35.678 --> 00:04:38.378
if you guys didn't get what you wanted in my will.

107
00:04:38.378 --> 00:04:40.247
TRAVIS: We can arrange it. Don't worry.

108
00:04:40.247 --> 00:04:41.228
SAM: Sorry.

109
00:04:41.228 --> 00:04:42.944
TRAVIS: We'll arrange that death.

110
00:04:42.944 --> 00:04:46.466
MATT: Okay, all right. Thank you, Sam. (chuckles)

111
00:04:46.466 --> 00:04:48.915
Thank you to D&amp;D Beyond.
(laughter)

112
00:04:48.915 --> 00:04:49.998
I'm so sorry.

113
00:04:51.823 --> 00:04:53.529
We have our second sponsor for the night.

114
00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:56.227
(laughter)

115
00:04:56.227 --> 00:04:58.184
SAM: The most awkward transition.

116
00:04:58.184 --> 00:05:00.221
(laughter)

117
00:05:00.221 --> 00:05:02.221
MATT: Hate you so much, Sam.

118
00:05:03.133 --> 00:05:05.662
Our returning friends at The Rook and The Raven.

119
00:05:05.662 --> 00:05:07.880
(cheering)

120
00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.783
(laughter)

121
00:05:10.783 --> 00:05:12.358
MATT: Their latest disc-bound on-demand

122
00:05:12.358 --> 00:05:15.095
Kickstarter campaign is off and running at this moment.

123
00:05:15.095 --> 00:05:15.928
Go and check it out

124
00:05:15.928 --> 00:05:17.019
if you get the chance.

125
00:05:17.019 --> 00:05:19.126
The new online service brings a whole new level

126
00:05:19.126 --> 00:05:20.372
of accessibility to your favorite

127
00:05:20.372 --> 00:05:23.228
campaign diary and planner.

128
00:05:23.228 --> 00:05:25.806
The new-- you can now type in,

129
00:05:25.806 --> 00:05:28.372
copy and paste, or upload your characters

130
00:05:28.372 --> 00:05:29.909
and adventures, and either print them yourself

131
00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:32.778
or have them printed, punched, and shipped to you

132
00:05:32.778 --> 00:05:34.015
on the same high quality stationary

133
00:05:34.015 --> 00:05:35.217
as the rest of your book.

134
00:05:35.217 --> 00:05:37.504
That's now fully customizable on a much

135
00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:39.038
easier and accessible level,

136
00:05:39.038 --> 00:05:42.520
which is now causing my wife to have a small aneurysm.

137
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.218
MARISHA: (yells)
LAURA: (laughs)

138
00:05:45.218 --> 00:05:46.718
MATT: There are tons of rewards and stretch goals

139
00:05:46.718 --> 00:05:48.587
available as part of the Kickstarter campaign,

140
00:05:48.587 --> 00:05:51.160
including unlocking an exclusive cover design,

141
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.487
a new book, a series of new book sizes

142
00:05:53.487 --> 00:05:55.683
the ability to fully customize your page layouts

143
00:05:55.683 --> 00:05:57.960
and even braille, which is fantastic,

144
00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:58.793
so go support the campaign.

145
00:05:58.793 --> 00:06:01.182
MARISHA: This is an irrelevant one to show off

146
00:06:01.182 --> 00:06:05.340
at this point because it's-- but the great-- that's yours.

147
00:06:06.567 --> 00:06:08.357
MATT: I got one here.

148
00:06:08.357 --> 00:06:11.598
There we go. That's a cover.

149
00:06:11.598 --> 00:06:14.583
(oohing)

150
00:06:14.583 --> 00:06:17.166
ASHLEY: Ooh, that is pretty.
TRAVIS: (deep voice) Dragons.

151
00:06:18.953 --> 00:06:20.311
MATT: So check them out at

152
00:06:20.311 --> 00:06:24.258
therookandtheraven.com/criticalrole

153
00:06:24.258 --> 00:06:26.081
and check out all the awesome elements of this Kickstarter

154
00:06:26.081 --> 00:06:27.868
and the rewards that are part of it.

155
00:06:27.868 --> 00:06:30.229
(cheering)

156
00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:32.515
MATT: A couple other few announcements here.

157
00:06:32.515 --> 00:06:33.757
We're happy to share with you guys tonight,

158
00:06:33.757 --> 00:06:36.082
we have a new addition to Critical Role,

159
00:06:36.082 --> 00:06:37.823
live closed captions.

160
00:06:37.823 --> 00:06:39.779
TRAVIS: (cheers)

161
00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:41.642
MATT: We have a fantastic stenographer who is

162
00:06:41.642 --> 00:06:43.515
playing along with us and writing up

163
00:06:43.515 --> 00:06:48.154
all the insanity we're spouting as best as they can.

164
00:06:48.154 --> 00:06:50.773
As you're currently watching and doing this,

165
00:06:50.773 --> 00:06:52.740
I'm so sorry, and we love you,

166
00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.109
and thank you and welcome aboard.

167
00:06:54.109 --> 00:06:56.468
MARISHA: Thank you. Welcome!

168
00:06:56.468 --> 00:06:58.136
MATT: Yes, so in order to bring them to--

169
00:06:58.136 --> 00:07:01.711
have live captions available for broadcasts,

170
00:07:01.711 --> 00:07:03.372
they can vary from device to device,

171
00:07:03.372 --> 00:07:05.820
so we created a quick how-to on critrole.com.

172
00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.810
Go there to check out the information

173
00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:10.588
on how to get that up and running.

174
00:07:10.588 --> 00:07:12.866
Next up we have our very first one-shot

175
00:07:12.866 --> 00:07:15.898
post-Kickstarter, that you guys helped put together

176
00:07:15.898 --> 00:07:18.641
as part of the stretch goals.

177
00:07:18.641 --> 00:07:20.046
So thank you all for supporting

178
00:07:20.046 --> 00:07:21.427
the Legend of Vox Machina Kickstarter,

179
00:07:21.427 --> 00:07:22.545
and as part of that, the first one coming up

180
00:07:22.545 --> 00:07:23.999
will be airing next Friday,

181
00:07:23.999 --> 00:07:27.221
June 21st, on our Twitch channel.

182
00:07:27.221 --> 00:07:30.294
Join us as the group of Vox Machina

183
00:07:30.294 --> 00:07:32.821
continue on their epic quest after finding Grog

184
00:07:32.821 --> 00:07:36.481
to now find Bob, the githzerai thief

185
00:07:36.481 --> 00:07:38.144
that stole all of their components

186
00:07:38.144 --> 00:07:40.060
and is preventing them from leaving

187
00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:41.654
the depths of Pandemonium.

188
00:07:41.654 --> 00:07:43.281
We're picking up for the second half,

189
00:07:43.281 --> 00:07:46.767
the unexpected second half of that adventure.

190
00:07:46.767 --> 00:07:49.345
It'll be available on VOD the following Sunday

191
00:07:49.345 --> 00:07:51.418
and on our YouTube channel as well.

192
00:07:51.418 --> 00:07:53.744
If you can, check it out live on our Twitch channel

193
00:07:53.744 --> 00:07:56.357
here next Friday evening.

194
00:07:56.357 --> 00:07:57.598
This is cool.

195
00:07:57.598 --> 00:07:59.966
Our next installment of Vox Machina Origins.

196
00:07:59.966 --> 00:08:02.120
(gasping and cheering)

197
00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.198
LIAM: So good, it's so good, it's so good.

198
00:08:04.198 --> 00:08:05.108
MATT: It's really great.

199
00:08:05.108 --> 00:08:06.569
Our comic series, made with our friends at

200
00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:09.822
Dark Horse Comics, will be on sale next month through

201
00:08:09.822 --> 00:08:11.413
Dark Horse Digital, and for the first time ever,

202
00:08:11.413 --> 00:08:12.529
local comic book shops.

203
00:08:12.529 --> 00:08:14.103
(cheering)

204
00:08:14.103 --> 00:08:15.517
MATT: We're going actually going to books--

205
00:08:15.517 --> 00:08:16.515
SAM: On paper.

206
00:08:16.515 --> 00:08:19.885
MATT: On paper, month-to-month.

207
00:08:19.885 --> 00:08:21.553
Be sure to check out your local comic book shop

209
00:08:24.089 --> 00:08:26.837
if you're looking into it.

210
00:08:26.837 --> 00:08:29.962
It looks amazing. The art's incredible.

211
00:08:29.962 --> 00:08:30.795
LIAM: The story's on point.

212
00:08:30.795 --> 00:08:31.628
MATT: The story's on point.

213
00:08:31.628 --> 00:08:32.987
Jody's done an amazing job with it.

214
00:08:32.987 --> 00:08:34.726
The next installment, super stoked,

215
00:08:34.726 --> 00:08:37.305
and this arc we get to see Vox Machina

216
00:08:37.305 --> 00:08:40.598
come into contact with and meet Pike.

217
00:08:40.598 --> 00:08:42.007
SAM: Spoilers, Matt, spoilers.

218
00:08:42.007 --> 00:08:43.210
MATT: You know about this.

219
00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:44.335
And Percival.

220
00:08:44.335 --> 00:08:45.503
SAM: And double spoilers!

221
00:08:45.503 --> 00:08:48.209
ASHLEY: Yeah!
TRAVIS: Yeah!

222
00:08:48.209 --> 00:08:49.042
MATT: Believe it or not,

223
00:08:49.042 --> 00:08:50.008
those characters show up in the campaign.

224
00:08:50.008 --> 00:08:52.007
(laughter)

225
00:08:52.007 --> 00:08:53.090
MATT: Yeah, check it out, super excited,

226
00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:57.239
super proud of it. Everyone did a great job on it.

227
00:08:57.239 --> 00:08:59.977
I believe that's all for our announcements tonight,

228
00:08:59.977 --> 00:09:01.434
unless I'm mistaken.

229
00:09:01.434 --> 00:09:02.267
So.

230
00:09:02.267 --> 00:09:03.237
TRAVIS: (sings Terminator 2 theme)

231
00:09:03.237 --> 00:09:04.142
LAURA: Same as before!

232
00:09:04.142 --> 00:09:08.075
MATT: (laughs) And on that note, let's bring us in

233
00:09:08.075 --> 00:09:11.859

(dragon roaring)

271
00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.621
MATT: And welcome back.

272
00:10:51.621 --> 00:10:54.138
So last we left off,

273
00:10:56.159 --> 00:10:58.029
the Mighty Nein had made their way northward

274
00:10:58.029 --> 00:11:00.509
across the Barbed Fields,

275
00:11:00.509 --> 00:11:05.255
the ground zero of the most heinous battles of the Calamity.

276
00:11:05.255 --> 00:11:09.313
You avoided a hunting roc,

277
00:11:09.313 --> 00:11:11.116
from atop a massive tree

278
00:11:11.116 --> 00:11:14.593
known as the Arbor Exemplar, raided parts of its nest

279
00:11:14.593 --> 00:11:19.066
while it was distracted in perpetual bat form.

280
00:11:19.066 --> 00:11:21.336
Made yourself northward, past the dangers,

281
00:11:21.336 --> 00:11:24.844
to the city of Bazzoxan, discovered elements of its history,

282
00:11:24.844 --> 00:11:28.551
and headed westward across the base of the mountain range.

283
00:11:28.551 --> 00:11:32.224
Through the dust storms and difficult visibility,

284
00:11:32.224 --> 00:11:35.997
eventually uncovering through divine spells,

285
00:11:35.997 --> 00:11:37.922
the opening, the hidden entrance

286
00:11:37.922 --> 00:11:40.454
to this strange underground location,

287
00:11:40.454 --> 00:11:45.318
of where your quarry, Obann, was seemingly searching.

288
00:11:45.318 --> 00:11:47.325
There, you went through the various tunnels

289
00:11:47.325 --> 00:11:51.908
into this deep, dark interior, this subterranean realm.

290
00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:55.603
Came upon some strange obelisk.

291
00:11:55.603 --> 00:11:56.895
Made your way to a doorway,

292
00:11:56.895 --> 00:12:01.741
where you found carved statues of celestial entities

293
00:12:01.741 --> 00:12:03.173
while the door was left upon

294
00:12:03.173 --> 00:12:06.592
and you saw, as fresh blood was pouring from their eyes,

295
00:12:06.592 --> 00:12:08.283
entering into the following courtyard,

296
00:12:08.283 --> 00:12:12.515
this cavern-like, enclosed underground courtyard,

297
00:12:12.515 --> 00:12:15.665
you saw what looked to be a massive, curved wall,

298
00:12:15.665 --> 00:12:18.550
like the outside of some temple or tower

299
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:20.596
that lied buried deep in the earth,

300
00:12:20.596 --> 00:12:24.444
exposed within this courtyard and surrounding it.

301
00:12:24.444 --> 00:12:28.001
Rubble, broken and torn pieces of armor

302
00:12:28.001 --> 00:12:31.506
and metal and weaponry, and over a dozen

303
00:12:31.506 --> 00:12:35.098
alabaster angelic statues like the doors themselves,

304
00:12:35.098 --> 00:12:37.765
all facing this entrance portal.

305
00:12:39.298 --> 00:12:41.631
Also bleeding from the eyes.

306
00:12:42.628 --> 00:12:45.657
You scavenged around, found some bones.

307
00:12:45.657 --> 00:12:46.885
Tried to find information about

308
00:12:46.885 --> 00:12:48.928
whether it was recent or ancient,

309
00:12:48.928 --> 00:12:51.758
but you did discover that the front

310
00:12:51.758 --> 00:12:56.050
adamantine door that seals this location is partially opened

311
00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:58.871
and beneath it, about a foot-and-a-half of space

312
00:12:58.871 --> 00:13:02.073
seems to continue inward into the chamber.

313
00:13:02.073 --> 00:13:03.944
And that is where we left off.

314
00:13:03.944 --> 00:13:05.108
So.

315
00:13:05.108 --> 00:13:07.835
You guys were deciding to enter the chamber.

316
00:13:07.835 --> 00:13:08.709
If you guys are doing this,

317
00:13:08.709 --> 00:13:09.582
is there anything else you're doing

318
00:13:09.582 --> 00:13:10.464
or are you moving forward, and if you are,

319
00:13:10.464 --> 00:13:11.624
what's the marching order?

320
00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:13.239
SAM: I think I start--
LIAM: Nott already--

321
00:13:13.239 --> 00:13:14.179
SAM: Nott already started.
MATT: That's right.

322
00:13:14.179 --> 00:13:15.617
SAM: Crawl in.

323
00:13:15.617 --> 00:13:19.552
LAURA: I want to go over and grab that skull.

324
00:13:19.552 --> 00:13:20.860
MATT: Oh, the angel one?

325
00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:21.693
LAURA: The one we were looking at.

326
00:13:21.693 --> 00:13:23.348
MATT: Okay, you pick it up.

327
00:13:23.348 --> 00:13:26.175
Look at it. It's smooth, like the dirt doesn't seem

328
00:13:26.175 --> 00:13:28.050
to cling to it, like almost as you breathe on it,

329
00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:28.899
you can see some of the dirt

330
00:13:28.899 --> 00:13:30.912
drifts off. It almost repels

331
00:13:30.912 --> 00:13:33.055
the dirt as part of its celestial nature.

332
00:13:33.055 --> 00:13:34.041
SAM: Ooh.
TRAVIS: Oh.

333
00:13:34.041 --> 00:13:36.175
LAURA: Caduceus?
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah?

334
00:13:36.175 --> 00:13:40.685
LAURA: Do you think it would be disrespectful to

335
00:13:40.685 --> 00:13:44.521
put a head of an ancient being into a haversack?

336
00:13:44.521 --> 00:13:45.571
SAM: (laughs)

337
00:13:47.526 --> 00:13:49.884
TALIESIN: If you're asking... I'm--

338
00:13:49.884 --> 00:13:51.171
LAURA: You've talked to them before.

339
00:13:51.171 --> 00:13:52.912
You've talked to things that were dead.

340
00:13:52.912 --> 00:13:53.778
TALIESIN: Sure.

341
00:13:53.778 --> 00:13:56.613
LAURA: Do you think it would be mad if we brought him in

342
00:13:56.613 --> 00:13:58.909
here and then later on we talked to him?

343
00:13:58.909 --> 00:14:01.073
TALIESIN: I don't think they'd really know.

344
00:14:01.073 --> 00:14:02.442
LAURA: Unless you can talk to him now.

345
00:14:02.442 --> 00:14:06.168
TALIESIN: Uh, now might not be the best time.

346
00:14:06.168 --> 00:14:08.535
I think we can save that for later.

347
00:14:08.535 --> 00:14:10.876
Yeah, let's take it with us and maybe--

348
00:14:10.876 --> 00:14:12.682
LAURA: All right, I'll put the head in the--

349
00:14:12.682 --> 00:14:15.613
ASHLEY: Do you feel like it's okay if we take it?

350
00:14:15.613 --> 00:14:19.030
What if this is like a tomb or something?

351
00:14:20.154 --> 00:14:20.987
LAURA: That's a really good point.

352
00:14:20.987 --> 00:14:22.495
TALIESIN: I think that this is a tomb.

353
00:14:22.495 --> 00:14:25.332
I just don't think it's theirs.

354
00:14:25.332 --> 00:14:26.636
LIAM: Caleb has spent this entire conversation

355
00:14:26.636 --> 00:14:28.333
looking at Nott and looking at them talking

356
00:14:28.333 --> 00:14:29.740
and looking at Nott leaving,

357
00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:31.482
and looking at them still talking and looking at Nott,

358
00:14:31.482 --> 00:14:33.843
and now I'm going to creep slightly under

359
00:14:33.843 --> 00:14:35.368
with my cloak--
MATT: You were invisible,

360
00:14:35.368 --> 00:14:37.845
weren't you, Nott?
SAM: I was at some point.

361
00:14:37.845 --> 00:14:38.915
Was I still invisible?

362
00:14:38.915 --> 00:14:40.484
LIAM: I think we said that you'd dropped it by now,

363
00:14:40.484 --> 00:14:42.761
but I don't really remember.

364
00:14:42.761 --> 00:14:44.915
MATT: I think you may have dropped it, yeah.

365
00:14:44.915 --> 00:14:46.836
SAM: Why did I drop it?
LIAM: I don't know.

366
00:14:46.836 --> 00:14:48.473
LAURA: Invisibility?

367
00:14:48.473 --> 00:14:49.492
I don't think you dropped it.

368
00:14:49.492 --> 00:14:50.430
SAM: I don't think I did.

369
00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:52.029
LIAM: You rifled through Yasha's pockets.

370
00:14:52.029 --> 00:14:54.173
SAM: I don't remember.

371
00:14:54.173 --> 00:14:55.098
LIAM: You rifled through Yasha's pockets

372
00:14:55.098 --> 00:14:56.975
trying to find your flask.

373
00:14:56.975 --> 00:14:58.474
Argued with people.
LAURA: Ask the chat.

374
00:14:58.474 --> 00:14:59.523
They'll know.

375
00:14:59.523 --> 00:15:01.917
MATT: (laughs)

376
00:15:01.917 --> 00:15:04.841
SAM: We'll find out in 15 seconds from the chat, I guess.

377
00:15:04.841 --> 00:15:06.555
(laughter)

378
00:15:06.555 --> 00:15:07.555
SAM: All right.

379
00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:12.212
Regardless, Nott has gone in before the rest of you.

380
00:15:12.212 --> 00:15:13.201
LAURA: Okay, I'll put the thing in the bag

381
00:15:13.201 --> 00:15:15.155
and then we'll just go, too.

382
00:15:15.155 --> 00:15:16.565
MATT: Okay.

383
00:15:16.565 --> 00:15:17.937
TRAVIS: Still invisible.

384
00:15:17.937 --> 00:15:20.304
MATT: That's what I thought.
SAM: Thank you, chat.

385
00:15:20.304 --> 00:15:21.925
MATT: I wasn't crazy. I wasn't crazy.

386
00:15:21.925 --> 00:15:23.662
MARISHA: Goggles on.

387
00:15:23.662 --> 00:15:25.227
MATT: All right.

388
00:15:25.227 --> 00:15:29.757
Marching order going in, aside from Nott, who is ahead.

389
00:15:29.757 --> 00:15:31.919
SAM: Oh, boy.
LIAM: I think for once,

390
00:15:31.919 --> 00:15:35.790
I am already in, so I'm going to say behind Nott.

391
00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:37.793
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: I'll be behind Yasha.

392
00:15:37.793 --> 00:15:38.967
LIAM: Not knowing where the hell she is.

393
00:15:38.967 --> 00:15:41.998
TALIESIN: I'll be behind you.
MARISHA: Okay.

394
00:15:41.998 --> 00:15:45.067
MATT: So we have Yasha and Beau.

395
00:15:45.067 --> 00:15:46.366
There's enough space for a number of you

396
00:15:46.366 --> 00:15:48.348
to fit underneath at once. It's a wide door,

397
00:15:48.348 --> 00:15:51.215
so you could all scoot in at the same time.

398
00:15:51.215 --> 00:15:52.514
SAM: Does anyone have a big old butt

399
00:15:52.514 --> 00:15:54.488
that stops them from squeezing through?

400
00:15:54.488 --> 00:15:56.244
Like it's a foot and a half.

401
00:15:56.244 --> 00:15:58.271
MATT: None of you are Grog-sized,

402
00:15:58.271 --> 00:15:59.874
but--
MARISHA: Big booty, big booty.

403
00:15:59.874 --> 00:16:00.707
TALIESIN: Tall.

404
00:16:01.778 --> 00:16:04.498
MATT: It requires you to crawl to get through.

405
00:16:04.498 --> 00:16:06.338
Some of you get lower and it's very much

406
00:16:06.338 --> 00:16:07.728
like having to pull yourself down

407
00:16:07.728 --> 00:16:08.983
and the door you expected to be

408
00:16:08.983 --> 00:16:11.194
a thin doorway. It's pretty far in.

409
00:16:11.194 --> 00:16:12.543
SAM: Oh, wow.

410
00:16:12.543 --> 00:16:14.910
MATT: You have to crawl for about three to four feet,

411
00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:17.371
pushing through and you're not sure if it's solid

412
00:16:17.371 --> 00:16:19.177
or if it's hollow.

413
00:16:19.177 --> 00:16:21.104
Whatever the case may be, there's a period of time where

414
00:16:21.104 --> 00:16:23.318
your mind can't help but consider

415
00:16:23.318 --> 00:16:26.336
the terrible strength of this if it were to come down

416
00:16:26.336 --> 00:16:27.336
and smash you.

417
00:16:27.336 --> 00:16:29.956
SAM: Oh, that could've been bad.

418
00:16:29.956 --> 00:16:32.686
LIAM: I'm actually going to snuff out

419
00:16:32.686 --> 00:16:35.936
my globule of light and just listen to people around me

420
00:16:35.936 --> 00:16:38.573
and go by hearing for the moment.

421
00:16:38.573 --> 00:16:39.559
MATT: Okay.

422
00:16:39.559 --> 00:16:40.646
No worries.

423
00:16:40.646 --> 00:16:41.990
LAURA: I think I should be in the back

424
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:44.742
because I was taking a long time with the skull.

425
00:16:44.742 --> 00:16:47.825
MATT: All right, so Jester's in the back.

426
00:16:49.289 --> 00:16:52.131
You all get down on your stomachs and your arms and knees

427
00:16:52.131 --> 00:16:54.249
and begin crawling your way through.

428
00:16:54.249 --> 00:16:57.668
Dust gathers at the edges of your forearms and

429
00:16:57.668 --> 00:17:00.722
the bits of your armor that are exposed.

430
00:17:00.722 --> 00:17:02.377
Your cloaks and stuff, again, draped past,

431
00:17:02.377 --> 00:17:05.710
just scooping up whatever bit of untouched element

432
00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:07.550
the ground would be here, dragging it into this area

433
00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:11.296
where the door was closed, no dust could enter.

434
00:17:11.296 --> 00:17:14.193
You enter before anybody else does.

435
00:17:14.193 --> 00:17:16.433
You come into the chamber.

436
00:17:16.433 --> 00:17:18.848
Looking around, you can see

437
00:17:18.848 --> 00:17:22.563
there are three pillars, would be a fourth,

438
00:17:22.563 --> 00:17:24.365
on the far right corner, but a portion of that wall

439
00:17:24.365 --> 00:17:26.157
seems to have tumbled in and there's an element

440
00:17:26.157 --> 00:17:27.593
of a landslide, bits of

441
00:17:27.593 --> 00:17:29.462
rock and wall have fallen off, toppled,

442
00:17:29.462 --> 00:17:33.402
and created this corner of rubble.

443
00:17:33.402 --> 00:17:34.877
You can see three other pillars

444
00:17:34.877 --> 00:17:37.563
in the space where you come out the other side.

445
00:17:37.563 --> 00:17:38.806
Make a perception check for me.

446
00:17:38.806 --> 00:17:40.470
SAM: Oh, I'm good at those.

447
00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:41.303
19.

448
00:17:43.606 --> 00:17:44.780
MATT: Okay.

449
00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:46.363
TRAVIS: Perceptive rogue.

450
00:17:49.645 --> 00:17:51.065
MATT: Okay, so 19 total?

451
00:17:51.065 --> 00:17:53.906
SAM: I have no pluses or minuses.
MATT: All right.

452
00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:55.864
SAM: It's just a straight roll.

453
00:17:55.864 --> 00:17:58.299
MATT: Looking across the way, there is

454
00:17:58.299 --> 00:18:02.763
a large gate of intersecting lattice metal bars

455
00:18:02.763 --> 00:18:06.144
that are at angles in each side.

456
00:18:06.144 --> 00:18:07.469
There's no more than maybe an inch

457
00:18:07.469 --> 00:18:09.374
to an inch and a half between each

458
00:18:09.374 --> 00:18:10.472
portion of this lattice that's open

459
00:18:10.472 --> 00:18:11.640
and it's shattered beyond that.

460
00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.163
The hallway is about 10 feet wide

461
00:18:13.163 --> 00:18:15.330
and about seven feet tall.

462
00:18:16.581 --> 00:18:18.072
SAM: It's a gate that's blocking

463
00:18:18.072 --> 00:18:19.101
a hallway that's past it?

464
00:18:19.101 --> 00:18:20.837
MATT: It's blocking an entryway

465
00:18:20.837 --> 00:18:23.967
that exits this chamber into another hallway beyond.

466
00:18:23.967 --> 00:18:24.800
SAM: Okay.

467
00:18:26.104 --> 00:18:30.264
No other people in the room, no other art or anything?

468
00:18:30.264 --> 00:18:33.269
MATT: You do see, with that roll,

469
00:18:33.269 --> 00:18:35.277
and you probably have to walk a little bit ways in

470
00:18:35.277 --> 00:18:37.107
to notice it, as you start looking,

471
00:18:37.107 --> 00:18:39.028
quietly moving around the sides,

472
00:18:39.028 --> 00:18:41.445
you can see what looks to be,

473
00:18:42.411 --> 00:18:46.132
can't tell if they're stones or satchels or sacks.

474
00:18:46.132 --> 00:18:47.591
There's things jammed and stuck

475
00:18:47.591 --> 00:18:51.327
up in the upper corners of the far back edge of the room,

476
00:18:51.327 --> 00:18:54.222
up at the top of where the crumbling portion

477
00:18:54.222 --> 00:18:56.640
of the far corner is.

478
00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:59.584
Almost like shelves that are filled with sacks.

479
00:18:59.584 --> 00:19:02.045
SAM: Sacks?
MATT: Of grain or rice?

480
00:19:02.045 --> 00:19:04.312
SAM: Grain or rice.
LAURA: Or body parts.

481
00:19:04.312 --> 00:19:06.318
SAM: Okay.
LAURA: (groans)

482
00:19:06.318 --> 00:19:08.055
If I continue walking into this room,

483
00:19:08.055 --> 00:19:09.805
will one be above me?

484
00:19:10.775 --> 00:19:12.076
MATT: You don't see any directly above you.

485
00:19:12.076 --> 00:19:15.531
They're more relegated to the edges of the far corners.

486
00:19:15.531 --> 00:19:16.364
SAM: Okay.

487
00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:20.036
I mean, I'll walk into this,

488
00:19:20.036 --> 00:19:23.502
probably not the center, that would be bad.

489
00:19:23.502 --> 00:19:24.335
Oh boy.

490
00:19:24.335 --> 00:19:25.340
MATT: You have-- there's the center

491
00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:28.432
and then there's the right and left, around the pillars

492
00:19:28.432 --> 00:19:31.252
that set in a square formation in the room,

493
00:19:31.252 --> 00:19:32.900
except for the one that's fallen in.

494
00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:34.925
SAM: I'm going to walk around towards

495
00:19:34.925 --> 00:19:36.420
the one that's fallen in already.

496
00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:38.733
Maybe that's a trap that was already sprung.

497
00:19:38.733 --> 00:19:41.900
MATT: Okay, so you curve around that side.

498
00:19:42.938 --> 00:19:45.086
You look up and get a bit of a better view

499
00:19:45.086 --> 00:19:49.386
of that area and it looks like a bunch of--

500
00:19:49.386 --> 00:19:52.024
they were sacks at a distance,

501
00:19:52.024 --> 00:19:56.250
at the edge of your periphery. Getting close,

502
00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:59.553
you can see they're bunches of

503
00:19:59.553 --> 00:20:03.316
textured, looks like rope or threads,

504
00:20:03.316 --> 00:20:05.157
thick threads that are all jammed together.

505
00:20:05.157 --> 00:20:06.615
SAM: Threads, Matt?

506
00:20:06.615 --> 00:20:08.752
Not intestines or something?

507
00:20:08.752 --> 00:20:10.228
MATT: Not intestines.
SAM: Okay.

508
00:20:10.228 --> 00:20:13.467
MATT: There's very, very dense striations across it.

509
00:20:13.467 --> 00:20:16.403
Like something has been wrapped multiple times in this.

510
00:20:16.403 --> 00:20:17.907
TRAVIS: (nervous laughing)
MATT: It's at that point,

511
00:20:17.907 --> 00:20:19.256
as you're walking around the corner--

512
00:20:19.256 --> 00:20:20.089
LAURA: No!

513
00:20:20.089 --> 00:20:21.379
TRAVIS: What do you mean?

514
00:20:21.379 --> 00:20:24.182
MATT: Something touches you and sticks to your face.

515
00:20:24.182 --> 00:20:27.542
You pull back.
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay.

516
00:20:27.542 --> 00:20:28.921
Some spiders.
LAURA: Spiders.

517
00:20:28.921 --> 00:20:31.263
MATT: Your hand has now touched one of them, too,

518
00:20:31.263 --> 00:20:34.563
and this long, heavy, thick, silk cord

519
00:20:34.563 --> 00:20:37.916
has adhered to your hand and the side of your face.

520
00:20:37.916 --> 00:20:40.898
MARISHA: Oh, no.
SAM: Oh, no (laughs).

521
00:20:40.898 --> 00:20:41.731
MATT: What do you do?

522
00:20:41.731 --> 00:20:45.400
You also hear the sound of the rest of your party

523
00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:47.696
very carefully crawling their way into the chamber.

524
00:20:47.696 --> 00:20:49.784
You can see them emerging from the other side of the door.

525
00:20:49.784 --> 00:20:50.617
LIAM: You know what happens when a

526
00:20:50.617 --> 00:20:52.536
little fly twangs the string, too.

527
00:20:52.536 --> 00:20:53.659
LAURA: Yeah.

528
00:20:53.659 --> 00:20:55.608
MARISHA: It alerts the whole--
SAM: Shit.

529
00:20:55.608 --> 00:20:57.809
LAURA: No, oh, no.
SAM: I'm invisible.

530
00:20:57.809 --> 00:20:59.230
TRAVIS: I fucking hate spiders.

531
00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:01.625
SAM: I have to communicate with you guys.

532
00:21:01.625 --> 00:21:03.800
LIAM: No light source at all, right, spilling our way?

533
00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:04.796
MATT: No, the only light source that was in there

534
00:21:04.796 --> 00:21:05.836
was the one that you were

535
00:21:05.836 --> 00:21:06.670
about to put in that, but you got rid of it.

536
00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:08.753
LIAM: Because I got scared.

537
00:21:09.591 --> 00:21:10.707
SAM: Oh, man.

538
00:21:10.707 --> 00:21:13.576
What does a little goblin do?
LIAM: So we're just coming

539
00:21:13.576 --> 00:21:14.993
through the door.

540
00:21:15.897 --> 00:21:18.717
SAM: Okay.
(laughter)

541
00:21:18.717 --> 00:21:20.562
MATT: You guys coming in, as you enter the area,

542
00:21:20.562 --> 00:21:23.271
the floor, and you noticed this thing last time,

543
00:21:23.271 --> 00:21:24.803
or you saw it a little bit with Frumpkin,

544
00:21:24.803 --> 00:21:27.463
there was this mud on the ground

545
00:21:27.463 --> 00:21:31.532
because clusters of somewhat dried mud that is--

546
00:21:31.532 --> 00:21:32.532
LAURA: It's poop!

547
00:21:34.002 --> 00:21:35.327
MATT: It resembles blood,

548
00:21:35.327 --> 00:21:37.302
but it's mixed with something thick.

549
00:21:38.205 --> 00:21:39.630
LAURA: No.

550
00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:41.479
TRAVIS: Do we look over and see Nott just like--

551
00:21:41.479 --> 00:21:43.272
MATT: Nott's invisible.
SAM: I'm invisible.

552
00:21:43.272 --> 00:21:44.189
TRAVIS: Oh, shit!

553
00:21:45.268 --> 00:21:47.663
SAM: Yeah.

554
00:21:47.663 --> 00:21:49.903
I will--
MATT: The room is entirely dark,

555
00:21:49.903 --> 00:21:52.771
which means Caleb cannot see anything.

556
00:21:52.771 --> 00:21:54.543
SAM: I will just loudly--
MATT: Nor can Caduceus.

557
00:21:54.543 --> 00:21:56.470
TALIESIN: No.
SAM: Loudly whisper.

558
00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:58.906
(loud whisper) Watch out for spiders!

559
00:21:58.906 --> 00:22:02.372
Watch out for spiderwebs!

560
00:22:02.372 --> 00:22:04.369
Watch out for spiderwebs!

561
00:22:04.369 --> 00:22:06.693
TALIESIN: Is there spiders?

562
00:22:06.693 --> 00:22:07.776
SAM: Spiderwebs!

563
00:22:08.632 --> 00:22:10.620
MARISHA: Can you talk to spiders like you talk to bees?

564
00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:12.691
TRAVIS: What is that sound?

565
00:22:12.691 --> 00:22:14.140
SAM: Spiderwebs!

566
00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:16.318
There's spiderwebs everywhere!

567
00:22:16.318 --> 00:22:18.148
TRAVIS: Did you hear that rusty door?

568
00:22:18.148 --> 00:22:19.328
LAURA: (laughs)

569
00:22:19.328 --> 00:22:22.384
TRAVIS: It sounds like hinges breaking apart.

570
00:22:22.384 --> 00:22:24.378
LIAM: Nott, is it safe for the light in here?

571
00:22:24.378 --> 00:22:25.568
LAURA: We should prep.

572
00:22:25.568 --> 00:22:26.889
SAM: (loud whisper) I do not know!

573
00:22:26.889 --> 00:22:28.288
TRAVIS: Are we all in the room now?

574
00:22:28.288 --> 00:22:29.495
MATT: You guys have all walked in.

575
00:22:29.495 --> 00:22:33.019
You've stepped up on the other side of the door.

576
00:22:33.019 --> 00:22:36.353
TALIESIN: I'm, yeah, I do not trust this room.

577
00:22:36.353 --> 00:22:39.140
I want to be very ginger with where I go.

578
00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:40.459
MATT: Okay, what are you guys doing?

579
00:22:40.459 --> 00:22:43.004
MARISHA: I feel like we should light this up.

580
00:22:43.004 --> 00:22:44.592
TALIESIN: The light was not a bad idea.

581
00:22:44.592 --> 00:22:47.193
TRAVIS: Yeah, I mean, we've got to make it an even playing

582
00:22:47.193 --> 00:22:48.892
field for the rest of this--
TALIESIN: I'm going to

583
00:22:48.892 --> 00:22:50.815
just put a tiny bit of light in this room.

584
00:22:50.815 --> 00:22:53.964
I'm going to give us a basic Light spell.

585
00:22:53.964 --> 00:22:55.190
Nothing fancy.

586
00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:56.202
ASHLEY: I'm going to take out my sword

587
00:22:56.202 --> 00:22:58.510
because Nott is making a weird noise.

588
00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:00.699
MATT: All right, so Yasha--
ASHLEY: She sounds in distress.

589
00:23:00.699 --> 00:23:02.699
MATT: -- pulls out which sword?

590
00:23:06.756 --> 00:23:07.896
TALIESIN: What do we see?

591
00:23:07.896 --> 00:23:10.524
MARISHA: Can I go into--?
MATT: Hold on.

592
00:23:10.524 --> 00:23:12.357
While you're deciding.

593
00:23:15.396 --> 00:23:17.478
MARISHA: Do I notice any movement?

594
00:23:17.478 --> 00:23:18.368
MATT: You can make a perception check.

595
00:23:18.368 --> 00:23:19.201
MARISHA: Okay.

596
00:23:21.739 --> 00:23:22.822
Natural 20.

597
00:23:24.907 --> 00:23:26.196
MATT: Okay.

598
00:23:26.196 --> 00:23:28.208
TRAVIS: (laughs)

599
00:23:28.208 --> 00:23:32.455
MATT: In this darkness, the textures of the room and the

600
00:23:32.455 --> 00:23:34.361
stone, from most perspectives, make it hard to see

601
00:23:34.361 --> 00:23:37.890
where these very thin strands of silk are everywhere.

602
00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:41.640
You just missed the DC to notice the threads.

603
00:23:42.497 --> 00:23:45.312
But you can now see this room has whole elements

604
00:23:45.312 --> 00:23:48.395
between these pillars where these wide webs are cast

605
00:23:48.395 --> 00:23:50.343
across the center of this chamber.

606
00:23:50.343 --> 00:23:54.627
Up in the edge, you can see these are all large sacs

607
00:23:54.627 --> 00:23:58.036
of things that are wrapped in this same, silk-like material.

608
00:23:58.036 --> 00:23:59.773
You can see small sections

609
00:23:59.773 --> 00:24:01.092
where the ceiling crumpled in.

610
00:24:01.092 --> 00:24:02.949
There's little holes and little alcoves

611
00:24:02.949 --> 00:24:06.844
that your vision can't go beyond this far away.

612
00:24:06.844 --> 00:24:08.620
You can just see

613
00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:10.120
a couple of small pockets where

614
00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:11.829
the stone has fallen away

615
00:24:11.829 --> 00:24:15.107
and something could be beyond the inside.

616
00:24:15.107 --> 00:24:16.339
MARISHA: Okay.

617
00:24:16.339 --> 00:24:17.672
I--
TRAVIS: I hate you.

618
00:24:18.616 --> 00:24:19.891
MARISHA: --alert everybody to the

619
00:24:19.891 --> 00:24:22.166
Mission Impossible-like laser maze.

620
00:24:22.166 --> 00:24:23.940
SAM: We need to put dust everywhere.

621
00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:25.413
TRAVIS: Or Entrapment with Sean Connery

622
00:24:25.413 --> 00:24:26.411
and Catherine Zeta-Jones.

623
00:24:26.411 --> 00:24:28.731
MARISHA: Yes, ooh, better reference.

624
00:24:28.731 --> 00:24:32.930
Then I alert everybody to the hole in the corner.

625
00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:35.593
I feel like we should keep our eyes up there.

626
00:24:35.593 --> 00:24:37.450
LAURA: I cast Bless.

627
00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:38.283
MATT: Okay.

628
00:24:39.283 --> 00:24:41.079
LAURA: On you.
TALIESIN: All right.

629
00:24:41.079 --> 00:24:41.996
LAURA: And Beau.

630
00:24:43.632 --> 00:24:44.465
And Fjord.

631
00:24:45.482 --> 00:24:48.249
SAM: (loud whisper) Can someone come cut me out of there?!

632
00:24:48.249 --> 00:24:49.633
MARISHA: Are you stuck?
LIAM: The room is illuminated,

633
00:24:49.633 --> 00:24:51.497
yeah?
MATT: The room is illuminated.

634
00:24:51.497 --> 00:24:52.706
TALIESIN: Very gently.

635
00:24:52.706 --> 00:24:55.555
I just got the standard Light spell up on my staff.

636
00:24:55.555 --> 00:24:56.530
MATT: Who gets Blessed, you said?

637
00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:58.863
LAURA: Beau, Fjord, and Caduceus.

638
00:25:00.505 --> 00:25:03.018
MATT: All right, there we go.

639
00:25:03.018 --> 00:25:04.425
Here, actually, let me give you a visual--

640
00:25:04.425 --> 00:25:06.244
SAM: Oh, there's a map!

641
00:25:06.244 --> 00:25:07.360
TALIESIN: I've been waiting.

642
00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.747
SAM: I don't know what this is, but just in case,

643
00:25:09.747 --> 00:25:14.332
if we go into combat, it will be powered by Dwarven Forge.

644
00:25:14.332 --> 00:25:16.625
Guys, they have a free download of their 406-page

645
00:25:16.625 --> 00:25:20.451
Dungeon of Doom module available on their website now,

646
00:25:20.451 --> 00:25:22.220
but only if we go into combat.

647
00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:25.488
If not, doesn't exist.
(laughter)

648
00:25:25.488 --> 00:25:28.933
TRAVIS: I'm sure we can talk our way out of spiderwebs.

649
00:25:28.933 --> 00:25:31.207
(shouting)

650
00:25:31.207 --> 00:25:32.936
MATT: So Nott, you are currently caught there

651
00:25:32.936 --> 00:25:34.198
as you're rounding the corner

652
00:25:34.198 --> 00:25:36.154
with the section that had fallen in.

653
00:25:36.154 --> 00:25:37.970
SAM: Ooh, blue light happening.

654
00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:39.944
LAURA: What's that little gold stuff on the ground there?

655
00:25:39.944 --> 00:25:42.426
Is there something cool? Is there treasure?

656
00:25:42.426 --> 00:25:43.496
MATT: It's just rubble...

657
00:25:44.996 --> 00:25:46.028
that you know of.

658
00:25:46.028 --> 00:25:47.609
MARISHA: It's just rubble.
TALIESIN: Fruity Pebbles.

659
00:25:47.609 --> 00:25:48.760
ASHLEY: Yeah, I see it.

660
00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:52.510
MATT: All right, so the rest of you have emerged

661
00:25:55.125 --> 00:25:57.350
in this vicinity.

662
00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:58.949
LAURA: I don't like it.

663
00:25:58.949 --> 00:26:01.866
I don't like it and I feel trapped.

664
00:26:02.723 --> 00:26:04.154
MATT: What are you guys doing?

665
00:26:04.154 --> 00:26:05.559
MARISHA: Nott, Nott!

666
00:26:05.559 --> 00:26:06.392
Where are you?

667
00:26:06.392 --> 00:26:07.309
SAM: Oh, shit.

668
00:26:08.253 --> 00:26:10.891
I'm over here!
(feet stomping)

669
00:26:10.891 --> 00:26:12.553
I'm going to stomp up and down

670
00:26:12.553 --> 00:26:14.361
and see if any dust gets caught.

671
00:26:14.361 --> 00:26:16.805
MARISHA: I'm going to see if I can follow Nott.

672
00:26:16.805 --> 00:26:19.334
MATT: I would like you to make a sleight of hand check.

673
00:26:19.334 --> 00:26:21.294
SAM: Oh, boy.
MATT: With disadvantage.

674
00:26:21.294 --> 00:26:22.900
SAM: Sure.

675
00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:27.642
Oh, that was a natural 20, but the other one gives me a 17.

676
00:26:27.642 --> 00:26:29.322
MATT: 17, okay.

677
00:26:29.322 --> 00:26:31.652
You stomp your feet a bit (wobbling).

678
00:26:31.652 --> 00:26:33.607
SAM: Oh no.
LAURA: Oh god.

679
00:26:33.607 --> 00:26:35.056
MARISHA: Do I see them?

680
00:26:35.056 --> 00:26:36.069
MATT: Do you see him, yeah?

681
00:26:36.069 --> 00:26:38.631
You see the web move a little bit

682
00:26:38.631 --> 00:26:39.464
and a little bit of dust (dust unsettling).

683
00:26:39.464 --> 00:26:42.316
MARISHA: Okay, I walk over and try to reach for her.

684
00:26:42.316 --> 00:26:44.109
MATT: Yeah, you reach out and you grab ahold of Nott.

685
00:26:44.109 --> 00:26:45.026
MARISHA: Oh, okay.

686
00:26:46.223 --> 00:26:49.103
SAM: Just take out, oh, shit, you don't have a blade!

687
00:26:49.103 --> 00:26:50.528
MARISHA: I do, I do.

688
00:26:50.528 --> 00:26:51.760
I've got my--
SAM: But don't cut me!

689
00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:53.193
But I'm not going to be visible.

690
00:26:53.193 --> 00:26:54.242
LIAM: Fire, fire.

691
00:26:54.242 --> 00:26:57.315
Pull her back, pull her back.

692
00:26:57.315 --> 00:26:59.155
TALIESIN: Gently.
LIAM: Gently away.

693
00:26:59.155 --> 00:27:00.880
Slowly.

694
00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:04.579
If there is any little bit of stretch.

695
00:27:04.579 --> 00:27:07.084
MATT: Point of order here, too.

696
00:27:07.084 --> 00:27:09.888
The Light spell that you cast, it flared up

697
00:27:09.888 --> 00:27:11.486
and over these moments that have happened,

698
00:27:11.486 --> 00:27:15.105
it's slowly withered to about half its strength.

699
00:27:15.105 --> 00:27:18.274
LAURA: Oh no.
TRAVIS: That's really bad.

700
00:27:18.274 --> 00:27:20.121
MATT: As opposed to the bright torchlight,

701
00:27:20.121 --> 00:27:23.198
it seems to be a diminished 30-foot radius.

702
00:27:23.198 --> 00:27:25.455
Most of the chamber, it's nowhere near

703
00:27:25.455 --> 00:27:27.310
as bright as you thought it would be and it's

704
00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:31.139
not something you've encountered before.

705
00:27:31.139 --> 00:27:35.202
Outside of maybe elements of the depths of the Savalierwood.

706
00:27:35.202 --> 00:27:36.660
TALIESIN: Sure.

707
00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:39.792
LIAM: As soon as I see Beauregard pull her back a bit,

708
00:27:39.792 --> 00:27:43.069
a small amount of flame appears in my hand

709
00:27:43.069 --> 00:27:45.421
and I flick it towards that little bit of stretch

710
00:27:45.421 --> 00:27:47.421
and try to burn the web.

711
00:27:48.381 --> 00:27:50.915
Just maybe six inches away from where Nott

712
00:27:50.915 --> 00:27:52.912
is connected.
SAM: Well, I'm invisible.

713
00:27:52.912 --> 00:27:55.126
LIAM: Well, I'm seeing (stretching).

714
00:27:55.126 --> 00:27:57.967
MATT: Yes, which in order for you to,

715
00:27:57.967 --> 00:28:00.431
I'll say this, Beauregard.
MARISHA: Yeah?

716
00:28:00.431 --> 00:28:03.253
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check for me, please.

717
00:28:03.253 --> 00:28:04.558
With disadvantage.

718
00:28:04.558 --> 00:28:06.061
MARISHA: With disadvantage.

719
00:28:06.061 --> 00:28:09.061
TALIESIN: That doesn't get the Bless either.

720
00:28:11.753 --> 00:28:13.484
MARISHA: It's a 15.

721
00:28:13.484 --> 00:28:15.249
20 total.

722
00:28:15.249 --> 00:28:16.288
MATT: Okay.

723
00:28:16.288 --> 00:28:19.155
You carefully maneuver and show Caleb

724
00:28:19.155 --> 00:28:23.701
specifically where Nott is without

725
00:28:23.701 --> 00:28:25.656
extremely disturbing the web.

726
00:28:25.656 --> 00:28:27.876
LIAM: Yeah, and I'm looking for a little bit of (weep!).

727
00:28:27.876 --> 00:28:29.734
TALIESIN: I am also looking up.

728
00:28:29.734 --> 00:28:31.108
MATT: Right, perception check.

729
00:28:31.108 --> 00:28:32.491
TALIESIN: Thank you.

730
00:28:35.083 --> 00:28:36.412
Pfft, 13.

731
00:28:36.412 --> 00:28:37.769
MATT: 13.

732
00:28:37.769 --> 00:28:41.075
Glancing up and looking around,

733
00:28:41.075 --> 00:28:43.892
what you do notice--
TALIESIN: Thank you.

734
00:28:43.892 --> 00:28:47.069
MATT: -- in a number of these small gaps,

735
00:28:47.069 --> 00:28:49.820
the light now causes some more shadows to appear

736
00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:52.650
and the shadows even further help expose

737
00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:56.413
some of these little holes in the corners of the chamber

738
00:28:56.413 --> 00:28:58.372
and elements of where these sacs

739
00:28:58.372 --> 00:29:00.388
that are adhered up to the

740
00:29:00.388 --> 00:29:03.437
upper ceiling portion of the chamber lie,

741
00:29:03.437 --> 00:29:08.354
you see (skittering) out of one,

742
00:29:09.483 --> 00:29:14.461
about 20 or so different legs start creeping through.

743
00:29:14.461 --> 00:29:15.983
LAURA: 20?

744
00:29:15.983 --> 00:29:18.715
MATT: Just little, up on the edge.

745
00:29:18.715 --> 00:29:19.699
LAURA: 20?

746
00:29:19.699 --> 00:29:21.641
SAM: Yeah, that's two-and-a-half spiders.

747
00:29:21.641 --> 00:29:23.239
MARISHA: (laughs)

748
00:29:23.239 --> 00:29:25.572
TALIESIN: 20 or so?

749
00:29:25.572 --> 00:29:27.122
LAURA: What if it's not spiders?
MATT: Up in this area.

750
00:29:27.122 --> 00:29:28.009
TRAVIS: On the other side?

751
00:29:28.009 --> 00:29:30.523
LAURA: Is it something other than spiders that made webs?

752
00:29:30.523 --> 00:29:33.040
TALIESIN: 20 or so little legs?

753
00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:34.322
20 or so little spiders.

754
00:29:34.322 --> 00:29:35.641
MARISHA: Or 20 big legs.

755
00:29:35.641 --> 00:29:39.185
TALIESIN: Do I feel that they have seen-- do I feel seen?

756
00:29:39.185 --> 00:29:40.628
TRAVIS: I cast Hydrogen Bomb.

757
00:29:40.628 --> 00:29:42.565
MATT: You feel--
(laughter)

758
00:29:42.565 --> 00:29:44.822
You feel seen, you feel loved.
TALIESIN: Okay, cool.

759
00:29:44.822 --> 00:29:48.572
MATT: You do sense that

760
00:29:48.572 --> 00:29:50.247
the movement is one means

761
00:29:50.247 --> 00:29:53.948
of them assessing anyone entering this chamber.

762
00:29:53.948 --> 00:29:56.191
The other would probably be light, as they have eyes,

763
00:29:56.191 --> 00:29:58.152
and the now brightly-lit chamber

764
00:29:58.152 --> 00:30:00.026
has drawn the attention of something.

765
00:30:00.026 --> 00:30:01.180
TRAVIS: I cast Terminix.

766
00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:02.394
MATT: I would like you all to roll initiative.

767
00:30:02.394 --> 00:30:03.916
LAURA: No!
(groaning)

768
00:30:03.916 --> 00:30:06.192
LIAM: I didn't get the Fire Bolt off? Argh!

769
00:30:06.192 --> 00:30:07.388
MATT: I'll say, as the Fire Bolt's happening.

770
00:30:07.388 --> 00:30:09.119
LIAM: Okay.
MATT: So you.

771
00:30:09.119 --> 00:30:10.999
TALIESIN: I was really hoping we'd just got out the phrase.

772
00:30:10.999 --> 00:30:13.378
LAURA: What a waste!
MATT: Sure, go for it.

773
00:30:13.378 --> 00:30:15.439
LAURA: A waste.
TALIESIN: I really wouldn't, please.

774
00:30:15.439 --> 00:30:18.434
MATT: Now roll initiative.
TALIESIN: Yeah, I know.

775
00:30:18.434 --> 00:30:20.080
SAM: You get advantage, right, Ash?

776
00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:21.064
ASHLEY: Yep.
SAM: Or something.

777
00:30:21.064 --> 00:30:23.739
LIAM: A d8 added to it.
SAM: Oh, a d8 added to it.

778
00:30:23.739 --> 00:30:25.659
TALIESIN: Do I get a, yeah, because you've got, yeah.

779
00:30:25.659 --> 00:30:27.303
TRAVIS: Does Bless affect your initiative roll?

780
00:30:27.303 --> 00:30:31.302
SAM: No, this is something Caleb gave to Yasha.

781
00:30:31.302 --> 00:30:33.396
LAURA: Bless only lasts for a minute,

782
00:30:33.396 --> 00:30:35.569
so depending on how long all that took,

783
00:30:35.569 --> 00:30:36.981
it's probably fizzled by now.

784
00:30:36.981 --> 00:30:37.814
MATT: All righty.

785
00:30:37.814 --> 00:30:39.461
Yeah, Bless would have faded at this point

786
00:30:39.461 --> 00:30:41.662
from you guys taking the time and everything.

787
00:30:41.662 --> 00:30:44.736
That's the issue with doing Bless outside of combat.

788
00:30:44.736 --> 00:30:47.194
That's okay, you could always cast it again.

789
00:30:47.194 --> 00:30:48.452
It's up to you.

790
00:30:49.958 --> 00:30:52.012
That's all right, so.

791
00:30:52.012 --> 00:30:55.160
At this point, Beau would be over here

792
00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:57.234
and Caleb would be right there helping to free Nott.

793
00:30:57.234 --> 00:31:00.495
Nott, you are, at this moment, freed from the web.

794
00:31:00.495 --> 00:31:03.653
A little bit burns a bit.

795
00:31:03.653 --> 00:31:05.865
SAM: (Sam's voice) All right. Thank you, guys.

796
00:31:05.865 --> 00:31:07.248
(Nott's voice) Thank you.

797
00:31:07.248 --> 00:31:09.037
(Marisha laughs)
MATT: So top of the round.

798
00:31:09.037 --> 00:31:10.735
We have 25 to 20.

799
00:31:10.735 --> 00:31:12.456
ASHLEY: I got 26.

800
00:31:12.456 --> 00:31:13.800
TRAVIS: What?!

801
00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:16.526
LAURA: Damn, damn. 24.

802
00:31:16.526 --> 00:31:19.244
TRAVIS: ♪ Damn, damn, damn! ♪

803
00:31:19.244 --> 00:31:21.266
ASHLEY: Do I use the d8 every time until?

804
00:31:21.266 --> 00:31:22.416
LIAM: No, one time.

805
00:31:22.416 --> 00:31:24.619
ASHLEY: Oh, well.

806
00:31:24.619 --> 00:31:25.452
Bye-bye.

808
00:31:29.017 --> 00:31:30.447

LIAM: ♪ Get yourself a double cheeseburger. ♪

810
00:31:32.626 --> 00:31:37.130
MATT: So 25 to 20, Jester 24, anybody else?

811
00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:38.589
25 to 20 anybody?

812
00:31:38.589 --> 00:31:40.164
All right.

813
00:31:41.708 --> 00:31:43.339
20 to 15?

814
00:31:43.339 --> 00:31:44.680
MARISHA: 16.

815
00:31:46.111 --> 00:31:46.969
SAM: That's it?

816
00:31:46.969 --> 00:31:49.173
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: Oh boy.

817
00:31:49.173 --> 00:31:50.351
MATT: 15 to ten?

818
00:31:50.351 --> 00:31:51.302
LIAM: Ten.

819
00:31:51.302 --> 00:31:52.135
LAURA: Oh god.

820
00:31:53.457 --> 00:31:56.082
TRAVIS: We're Fjorucked.

821
00:31:56.082 --> 00:31:57.298
Fjucked.

822
00:31:59.601 --> 00:32:02.299
MATT: 20-- sorry. Ten to five?

823
00:32:02.299 --> 00:32:03.918
SAM: Seven.

824
00:32:03.918 --> 00:32:05.636
Where are you guys?

825
00:32:05.636 --> 00:32:06.776
MATT: All right.

826
00:32:06.776 --> 00:32:09.644
Caduceus and Fjord, where are you guys at?

827
00:32:09.644 --> 00:32:11.768
Oh, man.
LAURA: You rolled a one?

828
00:32:11.768 --> 00:32:13.262
LIAM: Greg, watch this [inaudible] charge!
ASHLEY: Well,

829
00:32:13.262 --> 00:32:16.555
you got it out of the way.

830
00:32:16.555 --> 00:32:17.388
MATT: Yasha.

831
00:32:18.273 --> 00:32:21.992
You have not noticed these things,

832
00:32:21.992 --> 00:32:24.040
except for when Caduceus says the phrase

833
00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:25.987
and you look over and you can see

834
00:32:25.987 --> 00:32:30.560
curling out of the upper edge of this wall here,

835
00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:32.768
up in this region,

836
00:32:34.403 --> 00:32:37.386
three of these crawling spiders.

837
00:32:37.386 --> 00:32:39.507
Now, when I say that they are about,

838
00:32:39.507 --> 00:32:40.870
they are about--
LAURA: They look real.

839
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:42.545
MATT: Five-foot wide.

840
00:32:42.545 --> 00:32:45.489
From edge to edge, so they're.
TRAVIS: Five-foot wide?

841
00:32:45.489 --> 00:32:46.371
MATT: Five-foot wide from edge to edge.

842
00:32:46.371 --> 00:32:48.525
Their actual body is about that big, the abdomen.

843
00:32:48.525 --> 00:32:50.662
You can see with the light that's,

844
00:32:50.662 --> 00:32:52.325
even suppressed, what little bit of light

845
00:32:52.325 --> 00:32:53.605
is reaching that side of the chamber,

846
00:32:53.605 --> 00:32:56.180
you can see the glistening edge of it hitting

847
00:32:56.180 --> 00:33:00.160
the eight shiny eyes across their faces, their mandibles.

848
00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:01.721
TRAVIS: Oh, kill it with fire.
MATT: What are you doing?

849
00:33:01.721 --> 00:33:02.911
LIAM: A total of 24 eyes.

850
00:33:02.911 --> 00:33:06.200
ASHLEY: All right, so I chose Magician's Judge.

851
00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:09.505
MATT: Magician's Judge, okay.
ASHLEY: Going with my OG.

852
00:33:09.505 --> 00:33:10.338
Okay.

853
00:33:11.578 --> 00:33:13.576
So they're on the move towards us.

854
00:33:13.576 --> 00:33:15.776
MATT: They're crawling out from the upper edge

855
00:33:15.776 --> 00:33:17.137
of the chamber.

856
00:33:17.137 --> 00:33:18.672
ASHLEY: Piders!

857
00:33:18.672 --> 00:33:20.920
(laughter)

858
00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:23.503
Okay.
TRAVIS: Make 'em cute, don't we.

859
00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:27.728
ASHLEY: All right, I'm going to start going towards them

860
00:33:27.728 --> 00:33:29.774
and see if I can.

861
00:33:29.774 --> 00:33:32.208
MATT: All right.
ASHLEY: I can get to one.

862
00:33:32.208 --> 00:33:34.283
MATT: 30, 35, 40.

863
00:33:34.283 --> 00:33:36.109
Since they're about ten feet up above you,

864
00:33:36.109 --> 00:33:37.483
they're out of reach currently,

865
00:33:37.483 --> 00:33:39.032
but you can hold your action for if one of them gets--

866
00:33:39.032 --> 00:33:41.327
ASHLEY: I'll hold my action if one of them gets close.

867
00:33:41.327 --> 00:33:42.191
MATT: You got it.

868
00:33:42.191 --> 00:33:44.113
Okay, that ends Yasha's go, Jester, you're up.

869
00:33:44.113 --> 00:33:47.621
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to--

870
00:33:47.621 --> 00:33:49.962
TRAVIS: Just getting all up in there.

871
00:33:49.962 --> 00:33:54.571
LAURA: I'm going to Invoke Duplicity.

872
00:33:55.845 --> 00:33:57.328
MATT: All righty.

873
00:33:58.888 --> 00:34:00.921
Where would you like your duplicitous self to go?

874
00:34:00.921 --> 00:34:03.754
LAURA: I'm going to--

875
00:34:03.754 --> 00:34:07.146
I can't see where I am.

876
00:34:07.146 --> 00:34:09.105
I'm going to take a step back.

877
00:34:09.105 --> 00:34:10.257
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: Like that.

878
00:34:10.257 --> 00:34:11.753
She's going to appear right behind me

879
00:34:11.753 --> 00:34:13.954
and step out so--
MATT: So they're not sure.

880
00:34:13.954 --> 00:34:15.446
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: Essentially, who is who.

881
00:34:15.446 --> 00:34:17.425
All right, so.

882
00:34:17.425 --> 00:34:20.317
So stepping there.

883
00:34:20.317 --> 00:34:22.787
Trying to keep it on the five-square grid there.

884
00:34:22.787 --> 00:34:24.842
Jester suddenly divides

885
00:34:24.842 --> 00:34:27.102
into two versions of herself back to back.

886
00:34:27.102 --> 00:34:29.294
LAURA: Yeah, and then I'm going to cast

887
00:34:29.294 --> 00:34:31.829
Spiritual Weapon at level four.

888
00:34:31.829 --> 00:34:33.111
MATT: Damn.

889
00:34:33.111 --> 00:34:35.108
All right, where do you want it to go?

890
00:34:35.108 --> 00:34:37.591
LAURA: Right next to the spiders

891
00:34:37.591 --> 00:34:38.907
and I'm going to hit one of them.

892
00:34:38.907 --> 00:34:41.215
MATT: You can do that. Go ahead and roll an attack.

893
00:34:41.215 --> 00:34:42.897
LAURA: Okay, hold on.

894
00:34:42.897 --> 00:34:45.890
Okay, okay, I cast, oh god.

895
00:34:45.890 --> 00:34:48.553
Okay. I know, I'm freaking out.

896
00:34:48.553 --> 00:34:50.126
Oh, good, that was a natural one.

897
00:34:50.126 --> 00:34:51.054
(groaning)

898
00:34:51.054 --> 00:34:54.343
LAURA: It's okay, I got it out of the way with an attack.

899
00:34:54.343 --> 00:34:56.286
MATT: Hits the stone and cracks above it.

900
00:34:56.286 --> 00:35:00.886
Now you hear the singular spider (screech)

901
00:35:00.886 --> 00:35:02.683
and you see they're all starting to curl out from it

902
00:35:02.683 --> 00:35:04.423
and you get the sense that another set of legs

903
00:35:04.423 --> 00:35:06.383
is starting to curl off from a space

904
00:35:06.383 --> 00:35:08.905
a little ways away from it.
LAURA: Great.

905
00:35:08.905 --> 00:35:09.838
MARISHA: Yeah.

906
00:35:09.838 --> 00:35:10.850
MATT: That finish your turn, Jester?

907
00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:12.156
LAURA: Uh-huh.

908
00:35:12.156 --> 00:35:13.577
TRAVIS: Don't get swarmed,

909
00:35:13.577 --> 00:35:16.376
whatever you do, everybody.

910
00:35:16.376 --> 00:35:19.361
ASHLEY: I forgot to fucking rage.

911
00:35:19.361 --> 00:35:21.395
MATT: Aw.
LAURA: Is it too late?

912
00:35:21.395 --> 00:35:23.467
SAM: You can start on the beginning of your next turn.

913
00:35:23.467 --> 00:35:25.232
ASHLEY: I'll do it the next turn.
MATT: Next turn.

914
00:35:25.232 --> 00:35:27.399
All right, so, Beauregard.

915
00:35:28.297 --> 00:35:29.634
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: Caduceus.

916
00:35:29.634 --> 00:35:31.776
ASHLEY: I hate spiders.
MATT: Caleb.

917
00:35:31.776 --> 00:35:33.402
LAURA: Those, they're just the right size

918
00:35:33.402 --> 00:35:35.114
that they actually look like real spiders

919
00:35:35.114 --> 00:35:36.619
just standing on the edge of the map

920
00:35:36.619 --> 00:35:38.688
and I don't like it.

921
00:35:38.688 --> 00:35:40.254
MATT: Then kill them off!

922
00:35:40.254 --> 00:35:41.870
LAURA: I'm trying!
MATT: I know.

923
00:35:42.768 --> 00:35:44.790
All right, so.
SAM: What if they're nice?

924
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:47.714
MATT: So Caduceus, Caleb, Jester,

925
00:35:47.714 --> 00:35:50.449
not Jester, sorry, Beauregard,

926
00:35:50.449 --> 00:35:53.531
you see a couple of stones

927
00:35:53.531 --> 00:35:55.773
tumble down from up in this corner.

928
00:35:55.773 --> 00:35:59.469
From one of the larger holes, you see

929
00:35:59.469 --> 00:36:02.167
these larger legs emerge, much larger than the other spiders

930
00:36:02.167 --> 00:36:03.393
that are climbing the opposite side.

931
00:36:03.393 --> 00:36:04.403
MARISHA: That's all right.

932
00:36:04.403 --> 00:36:05.767
TRAVIS: No, no, no.

933
00:36:05.767 --> 00:36:08.325
Don't do it!

934
00:36:08.325 --> 00:36:09.640
What is that?!

935
00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:12.048
MATT: Crawling out of the side, you see the body.

936
00:36:12.048 --> 00:36:13.495
Now you have a better look at it now,

937
00:36:13.495 --> 00:36:16.720
this body is a deep gray, almost black,

938
00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:19.405
with these red stripe-like hooked striations

939
00:36:19.405 --> 00:36:20.789
that come across the front of the body.

940
00:36:20.789 --> 00:36:24.495
At the edge of each joint of its leg,

941
00:36:24.495 --> 00:36:26.102
a large barbed hook comes out there

942
00:36:26.102 --> 00:36:27.393
and there it looks like a row of horns

943
00:36:27.393 --> 00:36:30.365
that goes down the back of its head and across its abdomen.

944
00:36:30.365 --> 00:36:32.618
Its eyes, now that you get a better look at it, too,

945
00:36:32.618 --> 00:36:35.538
glow this dull orange color with a tiny white dot

946
00:36:35.538 --> 00:36:37.366
where the pupil you would think would be

947
00:36:37.366 --> 00:36:38.891
if these things had a singular pupil.

948
00:36:38.891 --> 00:36:40.224
LIAM: Uh, wrong.

949
00:36:41.591 --> 00:36:44.161
MATT: It curls out these giant mandibles.

950
00:36:44.161 --> 00:36:45.009
MARISHA: Demon spider.

951
00:36:45.009 --> 00:36:46.993
MATT: What you see now as it comes down

952
00:36:46.993 --> 00:36:50.085
is, on the back of its large, bulbous abdomen,

953
00:36:50.085 --> 00:36:52.407
there is some sort of a large, curled stinger

954
00:36:52.407 --> 00:36:54.768
that curves underneath its body

955
00:36:54.768 --> 00:36:59.133
that's like twitching and puckering as it's pulling its way

956
00:36:59.133 --> 00:37:00.947
out of the bottom of its body.
ASHLEY: I don't want it!

957
00:37:00.947 --> 00:37:02.909
TRAVIS: Is it pulsing? They doing the bee sting pulse?

958
00:37:02.909 --> 00:37:03.907
MATT: Yeah.
TRAVIS: For no reason.

959
00:37:03.907 --> 00:37:05.921
MATT: It pulls its legs up on the side of the wall,

960
00:37:05.921 --> 00:37:07.641
exposing the bottom.

961
00:37:07.641 --> 00:37:09.832
You see its spinneret (firing)

962
00:37:09.832 --> 00:37:12.763
and fire this gout of thread

963
00:37:12.763 --> 00:37:15.636
out towards you, Caleb.

964
00:37:15.636 --> 00:37:16.680
TRAVIS: To Caleb?!

965
00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:19.308
MARISHA: It's trying to catch Caleb.

966
00:37:19.308 --> 00:37:23.160
MATT: That's a 21 to hit.

967
00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:25.749
LIAM: Yeah, hits.
MATT: Fuck, okay.

968
00:37:25.749 --> 00:37:29.130
It hits you and splatters and it feels warm,

969
00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:32.633
like not burning, but like it has a heat

970
00:37:32.633 --> 00:37:34.545
radiating from it that you weren't expecting

971
00:37:34.545 --> 00:37:38.636
and it hits your chest and pulls you.

972
00:37:38.636 --> 00:37:39.962
(shouting)

973
00:37:39.962 --> 00:37:41.587
TRAVIS: Grab that fucking wizard!

974
00:37:41.587 --> 00:37:42.978
MATT: Onto its side there.

975
00:37:42.978 --> 00:37:44.592
MARISHA: Can I?

976
00:37:44.592 --> 00:37:47.139
TRAVIS: As a reaction or something?
MARISHA: Can I try and grab Caleb

977
00:37:47.139 --> 00:37:48.085
as a reaction?
MATT: Sure, go for it.

978
00:37:48.085 --> 00:37:50.723
Go ahead and--
LAURA: Yeah, like a missile.

979
00:37:50.723 --> 00:37:53.089
MATT: Make an attack roll.

980
00:37:53.089 --> 00:37:54.020
MARISHA: An attack roll?

981
00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:56.045
MATT: Yeah.
LIAM: A stick wizard.

982
00:37:56.045 --> 00:37:57.684
MARISHA: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, 29.

983
00:37:57.684 --> 00:37:58.517
MATT: Okay, you grab him. I need you to make

984
00:37:58.517 --> 00:37:59.697
a strength check for me.

985
00:37:59.697 --> 00:38:02.195
MARISHA: That's not her most strong suit!

986
00:38:02.195 --> 00:38:04.678
LAURA: You're going to get pulled in, too!

987
00:38:04.678 --> 00:38:05.856
MATT: Go for it.

988
00:38:05.856 --> 00:38:06.998
MARISHA: Just a straight check?

989
00:38:06.998 --> 00:38:07.943
MATT: Yeah, it's you versus it.

990
00:38:07.943 --> 00:38:09.685
TRAVIS: (laughs) You already know.

991
00:38:09.685 --> 00:38:11.440
I can see his hair levitating.

992
00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:13.001
MARISHA: Why did I do this?

993
00:38:13.001 --> 00:38:14.915
I have instant regrets.

994
00:38:14.915 --> 00:38:16.308
TRAVIS: It's a nine.
MARISHA: Nine.

995
00:38:16.308 --> 00:38:17.852
Plus-- a nine.

996
00:38:17.852 --> 00:38:20.240
MATT: You see Caleb get yanked and you grab onto him

997
00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:22.042
and both of you

998
00:38:22.042 --> 00:38:22.990
get pulled up.

999
00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:24.140
SAM: Maybe I should grab onto her.

1000
00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:27.259
(laughter)

1001
00:38:27.259 --> 00:38:29.839
TRAVIS: Why didn't I keep my mouth closed?!

1002
00:38:29.839 --> 00:38:33.766
MATT: So Caleb, you're pulled up towards it.

1003
00:38:33.766 --> 00:38:36.945
TRAVIS: Oh fuck, oh fuck.
SAM: Oh, boy.

1004
00:38:36.945 --> 00:38:38.877
MATT: As you're pulled in towards its chest,

1005
00:38:38.877 --> 00:38:41.540
two of its legs grab around you and hold you

1006
00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:42.833
and the stinger, you see

1007
00:38:42.833 --> 00:38:45.338
emerging through the muscles, pulsing

1008
00:38:45.338 --> 00:38:47.107
and try to hook you in the stomach.

1009
00:38:47.107 --> 00:38:49.002
SAM: Oh god.

1010
00:38:49.002 --> 00:38:51.233
MATT: That's going to be 16 to hit.

1011
00:38:51.233 --> 00:38:53.472
LIAM: Uh, Shield.

1012
00:38:53.472 --> 00:38:55.096
MATT: All right.

1013
00:38:55.096 --> 00:38:56.275
Yeah, he'd be able to.

1014
00:38:56.275 --> 00:38:58.227
LIAM: Okay, yep.

1015
00:38:58.227 --> 00:39:01.265
MATT: All right, so the stinger comes right for your stomach

1016
00:39:01.265 --> 00:39:04.153
and as you see this horrible, hooked,

1017
00:39:04.153 --> 00:39:06.215
jagged towards the tip on its underneath point,

1018
00:39:06.215 --> 00:39:08.444
this smooth obsidian-looking,

1019
00:39:08.444 --> 00:39:11.296
I would say jet-looking dagger of a stinger

1020
00:39:11.296 --> 00:39:12.400
come towards your belly.

1021
00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:14.017
Whoosh, there's a flash of arcane energy

1022
00:39:14.017 --> 00:39:15.843
and it scrapes up of it,

1023
00:39:15.843 --> 00:39:18.446
causing these arcane sparks to flash up underneath

1024
00:39:18.446 --> 00:39:20.398
before it withdraws once more into its belly.

1025
00:39:20.398 --> 00:39:21.648
LIAM: Just the tip.

1026
00:39:23.366 --> 00:39:27.438
MATT: That's going to be its turn.

1027
00:39:27.438 --> 00:39:30.638
But you currently are grappled.

1028
00:39:30.638 --> 00:39:33.141
LIAM: So do I have the ability to use my hands at all?

1029
00:39:33.141 --> 00:39:34.311
MATT: Yeah, you can do anything you want,

1030
00:39:34.311 --> 00:39:35.848
you just can't move. Your speed is zero.

1031
00:39:35.848 --> 00:39:37.806
You are essentially stuck where you are.

1032
00:39:37.806 --> 00:39:39.543
TRAVIS: You have the ability to freak the fuck out.

1033
00:39:39.543 --> 00:39:41.104
MATT: It is now Beau's turn.
LIAM: It's doing it.

1034
00:39:41.104 --> 00:39:42.240
MARISHA: Okay.

1035
00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:44.484
LIAM: Doing it and doing it and doing it well.

1036
00:39:44.484 --> 00:39:45.317
MARISHA: I'm going to try and punch it

1037
00:39:45.317 --> 00:39:46.954
in one of its eight eyes.

1038
00:39:46.954 --> 00:39:49.948
MATT: Go for it.
TRAVIS: Represent Queens.

1039
00:39:49.948 --> 00:39:52.069
MARISHA: Oh, fuck me, 13.

1040
00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:53.569
MATT: 13 does not hit.

1041
00:39:54.436 --> 00:39:56.621
MARISHA: Next attack, sorry.

1042
00:39:56.621 --> 00:39:58.080
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: Oh, sorry.

1043
00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:00.029
You can go ahead and do your description.

1044
00:40:00.029 --> 00:40:01.933
MATT: I was just saying you go to punch

1045
00:40:01.933 --> 00:40:03.699
and it ducks out of the way

1046
00:40:03.699 --> 00:40:05.519
and you glance off the side of its hide.

1047
00:40:05.519 --> 00:40:07.079
MARISHA: This one is 23.

1048
00:40:07.079 --> 00:40:08.246
MATT: 23 does hit.

1049
00:40:11.043 --> 00:40:12.204
MARISHA: Okay.

1050
00:40:12.204 --> 00:40:14.358
Eight damage, stunning strike.

1051
00:40:14.358 --> 00:40:16.166
MATT: All right, eight.
TRAVIS: I love the snaps.

1052
00:40:17.646 --> 00:40:20.244
That is going to be a 15.

1053
00:40:20.244 --> 00:40:22.286
MARISHA: 15.
MATT: What's your DC?

1054
00:40:22.286 --> 00:40:25.399
MARISHA: Is my DC.

1055
00:40:25.399 --> 00:40:27.962
MATT: 13 plus two, yeah, no, it does.

1056
00:40:27.962 --> 00:40:31.192
All right, it resists it.

1057
00:40:31.192 --> 00:40:33.419
You do manage to get a fist right off the side of its head

1058
00:40:33.419 --> 00:40:35.206
and it slaps in and two of the eyes

1059
00:40:35.206 --> 00:40:38.253
pull back in to try and absorb the impact as you hit.

1060
00:40:38.253 --> 00:40:40.883
It doesn't seem to ring it hard enough.

1061
00:40:40.883 --> 00:40:42.466
That's your action.

1062
00:40:43.439 --> 00:40:45.510
MARISHA: Then I'm going to take a bonus action.

1063
00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:46.699
TRVIS: This is not starting well.

1064
00:40:46.699 --> 00:40:49.116
MARISHA: Sorry, Caleb, to disengage,

1065
00:40:50.628 --> 00:40:53.946
to do Step of the Wind.
MATT: Okay.

1066
00:40:53.946 --> 00:40:56.045
MARISHA: And get out of there.

1067
00:40:56.045 --> 00:40:57.451
SAM: (Irish accent) Get out of there.

1068
00:40:57.451 --> 00:40:59.158
MATT: Okay, where are you going?

1069
00:40:59.158 --> 00:41:01.157
MARISHA: Yardy dardy dardy.

1070
00:41:01.157 --> 00:41:01.990
Well.

1071
00:41:03.729 --> 00:41:05.383
I want to get out of the way.

1072
00:41:05.383 --> 00:41:07.352
I'm going to come back here down to Nott.

1073
00:41:07.352 --> 00:41:10.352
LIAM: I'm super weak and I'm in the jaws of the monster.

1074
00:41:10.352 --> 00:41:12.609
MATT: All right, and Step of the Wind,

1075
00:41:12.609 --> 00:41:17.015
that means you're immune to opportunity attacks.

1076
00:41:17.015 --> 00:41:19.114
MARISHA: I can disengage or dash.

1077
00:41:19.114 --> 00:41:20.766
MATT: So you disengaged--
MARISHA: I disengaged.

1078
00:41:20.766 --> 00:41:22.482
MATT: You moved, got it, you got it, cool.

1079
00:41:22.482 --> 00:41:23.858
That finishes your turn, Beau.

1080
00:41:23.858 --> 00:41:24.691
MARISHA: Correct.

1081
00:41:24.691 --> 00:41:26.169
MATT: All right, now it's the rest of their turns.

1082
00:41:26.169 --> 00:41:28.022
LAURA: No!
LIAM: Oh god.

1083
00:41:28.022 --> 00:41:30.380
TRAVIS: Would you clarify how many applies to "their."

1084
00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:31.890
MATT: All three of these.

1085
00:41:31.890 --> 00:41:35.889
This one's going to rush past to head over this direction.

1086
00:41:35.889 --> 00:41:38.517
This one's going to stay down here,

1087
00:41:38.517 --> 00:41:40.885
and these are both going to come and leap down

1088
00:41:40.885 --> 00:41:43.603
to flank Yasha.

1089
00:41:43.603 --> 00:41:44.749
While this one comes up to Caduceus.

1090
00:41:44.749 --> 00:41:46.506
LAURA: Yasha, why aren't you raging?

1091
00:41:46.506 --> 00:41:48.749
MATT: Only one of them runs past.

1092
00:41:48.749 --> 00:41:50.388
You are holding your reaction.

1093
00:41:50.388 --> 00:41:53.055
Which one do you want to strike?

1094
00:41:54.122 --> 00:41:56.322
ASHLEY: The one that's running past, I guess.

1095
00:41:56.322 --> 00:41:57.389
MATT: Okay.

1096
00:41:57.389 --> 00:41:59.622
SAM: She's given up already.

1097
00:41:59.622 --> 00:42:00.697
TRAVIS: It doesn't matter to me.

1098
00:42:00.697 --> 00:42:01.897
The killing's all the same.

1099
00:42:01.897 --> 00:42:02.965
MATT: Roll an attack.

1100
00:42:02.965 --> 00:42:04.931
ASHLEY: Dinner time. Okay.

1101
00:42:04.931 --> 00:42:06.414
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right. You eat this shit.

1102
00:42:06.414 --> 00:42:08.520
SAM: Oh, that's right.

1103
00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:10.183
Crab legs.
LAURA: Are these the things?

1104
00:42:10.183 --> 00:42:11.016
ASHLEY: Fuck.

1105
00:42:12.615 --> 00:42:14.100
Okay.

1106
00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:16.889
That would be a 14.

1107
00:42:16.889 --> 00:42:17.846
MATT: 14 hits.

1108
00:42:17.846 --> 00:42:19.988
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.

1109
00:42:19.988 --> 00:42:23.508
So I'm not raging.

1110
00:42:23.508 --> 00:42:25.221
MATT: You are not raging, so it's just

1111
00:42:25.221 --> 00:42:29.804
your attack, which is 2d6, plus your strength bonus.

1112
00:42:32.725 --> 00:42:34.546
TRAVIS: Actually, 3d6, because of Divine Fury, right?

1113
00:42:34.546 --> 00:42:36.683
MATT: She doesn't, can only use that while raging.

1114
00:42:36.683 --> 00:42:38.635
ASHLEY: That's only if you're raging?

1115
00:42:38.635 --> 00:42:42.877
Okay, so that would be seven points of damage.

1116
00:42:42.877 --> 00:42:44.867
MATT: Seven points of damage.

1117
00:42:44.867 --> 00:42:47.059
You hack into the back of its body.

1118
00:42:47.059 --> 00:42:48.211
You actually throw it

1119
00:42:48.211 --> 00:42:49.874
about two feet in the air with a blow.

1120
00:42:49.874 --> 00:42:52.038
It lands and keeps skittering towards Caduceus.

1121
00:42:52.038 --> 00:42:53.802
It's wounded, but it's not killed.

1122
00:42:53.802 --> 00:42:54.635
ASHLEY: Okay.

1123
00:42:56.607 --> 00:43:01.274
MATT: A bunch more begin to start swarming out of the walls.

1124
00:43:02.329 --> 00:43:03.711
MARISHA: Yeah.

1125
00:43:03.711 --> 00:43:06.591
LIAM: Ooper-dooper!
TRAVIS: Yeah, feels like it.

1126
00:43:06.591 --> 00:43:07.872
Come on, man.

1127
00:43:07.872 --> 00:43:09.676
Look, why you gotta put the ones that are like

1128
00:43:09.676 --> 00:43:11.775
the front legs up in the air, Matt?

1129
00:43:11.775 --> 00:43:13.707
Put them over there.

1130
00:43:13.707 --> 00:43:15.961
MARISHA: Oh no!
(yelling)

1131
00:43:15.961 --> 00:43:16.883
TRAVIS: Fuck!

1132
00:43:16.883 --> 00:43:19.435
Fuck!
LIAM: Oh, this is exciting.

1133
00:43:19.435 --> 00:43:21.286
ASHLEY and LAURA: That's too many.

1134
00:43:21.286 --> 00:43:23.551
SAM: There's too many of them!

1135
00:43:23.551 --> 00:43:25.098
LAURA: (yells)
TRAVIS: (high-pitched scream)

1136
00:43:25.098 --> 00:43:27.230
ASHLEY: I don't want to go against <i>that</i> one!

1137
00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:29.151
LAURA: (laughs)

1138
00:43:29.151 --> 00:43:31.196
MATT: They start swarming out, skittering.

1139
00:43:31.196 --> 00:43:32.470
TALIESIN: I've totally have this happen, it's fine.

1140
00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:33.303
TRAVIS: Fuck!

1141
00:43:34.167 --> 00:43:35.115
MATT: Just come rushing down

1142
00:43:35.115 --> 00:43:37.230
and swarming you guys from the corners.

1143
00:43:37.230 --> 00:43:39.801
So two against you, Yasha,

1144
00:43:39.801 --> 00:43:43.564
with advantage because they do have you flanking.

1145
00:43:43.564 --> 00:43:46.903
That's going to be 21 to hit.

1146
00:43:46.903 --> 00:43:49.081
ASHLEY: Mm-hm.
MATT: All right.

1147
00:43:49.081 --> 00:43:49.998
You suffer...

1148
00:43:51.207 --> 00:43:52.817
five points piercing damage.

1149
00:43:52.817 --> 00:43:53.727
ASHLEY: Fine.

1150
00:43:53.727 --> 00:43:55.527
Which is--

1151
00:43:55.527 --> 00:43:57.285
Nothing because I take it all.

1152
00:43:57.285 --> 00:43:59.770
MATT: And seven points poison damage.

1153
00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:02.978
ASHLEY: And seven points of poison damage, okay.

1154
00:44:02.978 --> 00:44:06.186
MATT: The other one against you is going to be

1155
00:44:06.186 --> 00:44:07.502
a seven to hit.

1156
00:44:07.502 --> 00:44:08.756
No, that's a miss.

1157
00:44:08.756 --> 00:44:10.611
The first one hits you (groans),

1158
00:44:10.611 --> 00:44:11.640
the second one reaches towards you

1159
00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:12.545
and you grab the front of its mandibles

1160
00:44:12.545 --> 00:44:13.991
and shove it away.

1161
00:44:13.991 --> 00:44:14.953
Pick up your weapon again,

1162
00:44:14.953 --> 00:44:16.049
prepare yourself for the next round.

1163
00:44:16.049 --> 00:44:18.597
Going against Caduceus, there's two.

1164
00:44:18.597 --> 00:44:21.385
It's going to be six to hit.

1165
00:44:21.385 --> 00:44:22.282
TALIESIN: Nope.

1166
00:44:22.282 --> 00:44:26.010
MATT: The other one, it's going to be 13 to hit.

1167
00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:28.375
TALIESIN: Was it the big one that was a 13 to hit?

1168
00:44:28.375 --> 00:44:29.948
MATT: They're essentially the same size.

1169
00:44:29.948 --> 00:44:32.362
I just didn't have that many of the same--

1170
00:44:32.362 --> 00:44:36.096
TALIESIN: The second one that missed,

1171
00:44:36.096 --> 00:44:39.496
I'm going to use my shield charge because I'm irritated.

1172
00:44:39.496 --> 00:44:40.458
MATT: Okay.

1173
00:44:40.458 --> 00:44:44.991
TALIESIN: That's

1174
00:44:44.991 --> 00:44:47.437
4d6 force damage.

1175
00:44:47.437 --> 00:44:48.571
MATT: 4d6 force damage.

1176
00:44:48.571 --> 00:44:49.988
TALIESIN: Then, yeah.

1177
00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:52.880
Then a strength saving throw.

1178
00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:53.893
MATT: Correct.

1179
00:44:53.893 --> 00:44:56.159
LAURA: Whoa!
SAM: That's pretty good.

1180
00:44:56.159 --> 00:44:57.385
TALIESIN: 19 points of force damage.

1181
00:44:57.385 --> 00:44:59.500
MATT: Doesn't need the strength saving throw.

1182
00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:00.646
You bring your shield down and it strikes the shield

1183
00:45:00.646 --> 00:45:02.575
and at that point you push it off

1184
00:45:02.575 --> 00:45:04.995
and you watch as the spider splatters

1185
00:45:04.995 --> 00:45:06.072
against this stone pillar.

1186
00:45:06.072 --> 00:45:07.111
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.
LAURA: That's good.

1187
00:45:07.111 --> 00:45:08.243
That's good. That's good.

1188
00:45:08.243 --> 00:45:09.609
SAM: Not too powerful.

1189
00:45:09.609 --> 00:45:11.109
TALIESIN: No, no, just no.

1190
00:45:12.105 --> 00:45:13.105
MATT: All right.

1191
00:45:14.025 --> 00:45:18.227
It's going to be two attacks against you, Fjord.

1192
00:45:18.227 --> 00:45:19.589
These guys are rolling shitty.

1193
00:45:19.589 --> 00:45:21.461
That's going to be an 11?

1194
00:45:21.461 --> 00:45:23.551
TRAVIS: That misses.
MATT: And an 18.

1195
00:45:23.551 --> 00:45:24.384
TRAVIS: That does hit.

1196
00:45:24.384 --> 00:45:25.217
MATT: Okay.

1197
00:45:25.217 --> 00:45:26.851
You take three points of piercing damage.

1198
00:45:26.851 --> 00:45:27.826
TRAVIS: Okay.

1199
00:45:27.826 --> 00:45:29.333
MATT: And five points of poison damage.

1200
00:45:29.333 --> 00:45:30.487
TRAVIS: Ooh, okay.

1201
00:45:30.487 --> 00:45:32.058
MATT: As its fangs stick into you and you feel the venom

1202
00:45:32.058 --> 00:45:33.511
from the blow, it actually catches you

1203
00:45:33.511 --> 00:45:34.879
on the side of the leg and

1204
00:45:34.879 --> 00:45:36.487
as you can feel the poison pulse through your body

1205
00:45:36.487 --> 00:45:39.666
with one quick burning, sharp pain.

1206
00:45:39.666 --> 00:45:40.783
Two against you, Beau.

1207
00:45:40.783 --> 00:45:41.783
LAURA: Oh my god.

1208
00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:43.583
MATT: That's actually not a bad roll.

1209
00:45:43.583 --> 00:45:45.148
18?
MARISHA: Miss.

1210
00:45:45.148 --> 00:45:46.504
MATT: Nice, and 21.

1211
00:45:46.504 --> 00:45:48.872
MARISHA: 21 hits, yeah.
SAM: Damn.

1212
00:45:48.872 --> 00:45:51.885
MARISHA: My AC's 20.
SAM: 20?

1213
00:45:51.885 --> 00:45:53.407
TALIESIN: Hard to hit a monk, man.
MATT: Yeah.

1214
00:45:53.407 --> 00:45:54.795
She's a dodge tank.

1215
00:45:54.795 --> 00:45:56.345
That's six points of piercing damage.

1216
00:45:56.345 --> 00:45:57.362
MARISHA: Okay.

1217
00:45:57.362 --> 00:45:59.497
MATT: And another six points of poison damage.

1218
00:45:59.497 --> 00:46:01.147
SAM: We should all be monks.

1219
00:46:01.147 --> 00:46:03.398
LAURA: Yeah, oh my god, a whole party of monks.

1220
00:46:03.398 --> 00:46:05.398
MATT: One of them came down.

1221
00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:08.393
TRAVIS: Down to the river to pray.
MATT: Actually, this one

1222
00:46:08.393 --> 00:46:10.665
is going to be-- no, I already placed it.

1223
00:46:10.665 --> 00:46:13.168
I was going to put it after Nott, but they're after Caleb.

1224
00:46:13.168 --> 00:46:15.100
Caleb, you still have a super high AC.

1225
00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:16.721
SAM: I'm invisible.

1226
00:46:16.721 --> 00:46:18.713
MATT: That's right, you are invisible.

1227
00:46:18.713 --> 00:46:20.029
Yeah, that misses you entirely.

1228
00:46:20.029 --> 00:46:23.885
It rolled an eight and you have super AC with your shield.

1229
00:46:23.885 --> 00:46:25.202
That finishes their go.

1230
00:46:25.202 --> 00:46:27.596
They're now just swarming out from the sides of the walls.

1231
00:46:27.596 --> 00:46:28.981
You're uncertain if that's all of them

1232
00:46:28.981 --> 00:46:30.485
or if there's more coming.

1233
00:46:30.485 --> 00:46:33.827
Nevertheless, the mama is out and has your wizard.

1234
00:46:33.827 --> 00:46:35.511
That brings us to Caleb's turn.

1235
00:46:35.511 --> 00:46:36.728
LIAM: Okay.

1236
00:46:36.728 --> 00:46:39.952
I start going through all my coat pockets quickly

1237
00:46:39.952 --> 00:46:44.271
and pull out a cocoon and I cast Polymorph on myself

1238
00:46:44.271 --> 00:46:47.596
and turn myself into an identical mama spider

1239
00:46:47.596 --> 00:46:50.331
if I am able, and if not, I will just do giant spider,

1240
00:46:50.331 --> 00:46:52.047
but I'm hoping for it.

1241
00:46:52.047 --> 00:46:53.161
MATT: Sure.

1242
00:46:53.161 --> 00:46:56.871
I'll say because I didn't have an additional spider here,

1243
00:46:56.871 --> 00:46:59.263
that this'll be you.

1244
00:46:59.263 --> 00:47:00.746
I'll say the bats, sure.

1245
00:47:00.746 --> 00:47:01.871
LIAM: <i>Gut.</i>

1246
00:47:01.871 --> 00:47:03.281
TALIESIN: Let's keep the goth happening.

1247
00:47:03.281 --> 00:47:04.297
LAURA: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Yes.

1248
00:47:04.297 --> 00:47:05.297
MATT: All right.

1249
00:47:06.354 --> 00:47:08.096
SAM: Didn't you kill one spider already?

1250
00:47:08.096 --> 00:47:09.331
TALIESIN: I'm going to name it Ozzy.

1251
00:47:09.331 --> 00:47:10.926
MATT: There we go, we'll say that's you.

1252
00:47:10.926 --> 00:47:11.759
LAURA: Yeah.

1253
00:47:11.759 --> 00:47:12.944
TALIESIN: Spiders versus bats.

1254
00:47:12.944 --> 00:47:16.629
LIAM: First question is, so that was my action to do that

1255
00:47:16.629 --> 00:47:18.404
and she was holding me.

1256
00:47:18.404 --> 00:47:20.695
It was a web that was holding me or her?

1257
00:47:20.695 --> 00:47:21.859
MATT: Both.
LIAM: Both.

1258
00:47:21.859 --> 00:47:24.081
Can I tell, in that split second,

1259
00:47:24.081 --> 00:47:26.330
if the web is still adhesive?
MATT: It is.

1260
00:47:26.330 --> 00:47:28.585
You're still attached. Your body transforms into it,

1261
00:47:28.585 --> 00:47:30.866
but you're still adhered and grappled by it.

1262
00:47:30.866 --> 00:47:32.521
You don't get a free escape.

1263
00:47:32.521 --> 00:47:34.983
LIAM: Then I do this with the legs.

1264
00:47:34.983 --> 00:47:36.709
MATT: (laughs)

1265
00:47:36.709 --> 00:47:37.824
LIAM: Because I can't break away, right?

1266
00:47:37.824 --> 00:47:38.952
Like then I'm done.

1267
00:47:38.952 --> 00:47:40.523
MATT: You have no speed, yeah, that's your action.

1268
00:47:40.523 --> 00:47:41.523
Okay.
LIAM: Okay.

1269
00:47:42.489 --> 00:47:43.905
MATT: Nott, your turn.

1270
00:47:43.905 --> 00:47:45.348
SAM: Oh, that's super confusing.

1271
00:47:45.348 --> 00:47:46.480
MATT: You're now sitting there and you see

1272
00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:48.598
this giant spider and then Caleb turns into a second spider

1273
00:47:48.598 --> 00:47:49.789
with a smaller spider.

1274
00:47:49.789 --> 00:47:51.599
Oh god, they're turning people into spiders!

1275
00:47:51.599 --> 00:47:53.997
(laughter)

1276
00:47:53.997 --> 00:47:55.608
You do see all the rest of your friends

1277
00:47:55.608 --> 00:47:57.061
being swarmed in the low light.

1278
00:47:57.061 --> 00:47:58.129
There's the central Light spell.

1279
00:47:58.129 --> 00:48:00.072
It's glowing the area, but it's super dark still

1280
00:48:00.072 --> 00:48:01.789
and you hear the sounds of

1281
00:48:01.789 --> 00:48:02.913
dozens and dozens of tiny legs

1282
00:48:02.913 --> 00:48:05.316
skittering across the stone floor.

1283
00:48:05.316 --> 00:48:09.048
SAM: If I were to move deeper into the room,

1284
00:48:09.048 --> 00:48:12.265
would I encounter more of those webs that got me before?

1285
00:48:12.265 --> 00:48:15.377
TRAVIS: There's two big ass ones on the floor.

1286
00:48:15.377 --> 00:48:17.368
In the middle of the room.
SAM: Well, yeah.

1287
00:48:17.368 --> 00:48:18.722
TALIESIN: Those are obviously just decoration

1288
00:48:18.722 --> 00:48:22.173
and not actually there.
TRAVIS: Those are mosaic style.

1289
00:48:22.173 --> 00:48:23.192
Can we see if those are mosaic webs

1290
00:48:23.192 --> 00:48:24.681
on the floor made of tile?

1291
00:48:24.681 --> 00:48:26.183
MATT: Oh, yeah, it's part of the decor.

1292
00:48:26.183 --> 00:48:27.016
TRAVIS: Good.

1293
00:48:28.503 --> 00:48:30.836
SAM: I'm feeling pretty hidden,

1294
00:48:31.966 --> 00:48:35.068
until I attack, so I think I can still discern

1295
00:48:35.068 --> 00:48:37.466
which one is Caleb, since he's the one all wrapped up,

1296
00:48:37.466 --> 00:48:39.640
so I'll shoot the other one, the mama spider,

1297
00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:41.079
with my crossbów.

1298
00:48:41.079 --> 00:48:43.203
MATT: Okay.
ASHLEY: Crossbów.

1299
00:48:43.203 --> 00:48:44.571
SAM: Natural 20.

1300
00:48:44.571 --> 00:48:47.903
MATT: All right. Make your attack, do the damage.

1301
00:48:47.903 --> 00:48:49.984
SAM: Wow.
LAURA: Get it, get it, girl.

1302
00:48:49.984 --> 00:48:52.283
LIAM: Ooh!
LAURA: Ooh, shit!

1303
00:48:52.283 --> 00:48:55.575
LIAM: That was the best d6 ever!

1304
00:48:57.194 --> 00:49:02.112
SAM: 20, 25, 31 plus--
LIAM: It's going to be nasty.

1305
00:49:02.112 --> 00:49:02.988
Double the dice.

1306
00:49:02.988 --> 00:49:07.054
SAM: It's 31 plus six, so that's 37.

1307
00:49:07.054 --> 00:49:08.403
LAURA: No, but you double the dice,

1308
00:49:08.403 --> 00:49:10.701
so 31 times, 62.
LIAM: 62 plus seven.

1309
00:49:10.701 --> 00:49:14.672
SAM: Plus six is 68.
LIAM: 69, no, aw.

1310
00:49:14.672 --> 00:49:16.947
SAM: 68, it's going to be 68.

1311
00:49:16.947 --> 00:49:18.148
MATT: Jesus.

1312
00:49:18.148 --> 00:49:22.381
TALIESIN: It's not nice.
ASHLEY: Can we just make it 69?

1313
00:49:22.381 --> 00:49:24.190
MATT: It's almost nice.

1314
00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:25.513
SAM: Wow.

1315
00:49:25.513 --> 00:49:27.028
MATT: So that's crazy.

1316
00:49:27.028 --> 00:49:28.603
SAM: Plus it shoots again automatically.

1317
00:49:28.603 --> 00:49:30.075
MATT: Yeah, it does, for the next attack.

1318
00:49:30.075 --> 00:49:31.003
TRAVIS: Do it.

1319
00:49:31.003 --> 00:49:32.519
SAM: That's a 24 to hit.

1320
00:49:32.519 --> 00:49:34.072
MATT: That hits.

1321
00:49:34.072 --> 00:49:36.080
SAM: Plus another eight points of damage.

1322
00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:37.342
MATT: All right, how do you want to do this?

1323
00:49:37.342 --> 00:49:41.806
(cheering)
(clapping)

1324
00:49:41.806 --> 00:49:42.639
ASHLEY: Yes!

1325
00:49:43.535 --> 00:49:44.806
LAURA: What the fuck?!

1326
00:49:44.806 --> 00:49:46.396
MATT: Wait, did you double the modifier on it or did you?

1327
00:49:46.396 --> 00:49:47.434
SAM: No.
MATT: Yeah, double the dice

1328
00:49:47.434 --> 00:49:48.403
and then added the modifier.

1329
00:49:48.403 --> 00:49:50.571
Yeah, we're clean, how do you want to do this?

1330
00:49:50.571 --> 00:49:52.783
SAM: Wow, wow!

1331
00:49:52.783 --> 00:49:55.690
I did not think that was going to happen.

1332
00:49:55.690 --> 00:49:56.700
MATT: Me neither.

1333
00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:59.363
(laughter)

1334
00:49:59.363 --> 00:50:00.196
SAM: Sorry, Matt.

1335
00:50:00.196 --> 00:50:02.719
MATT: No, it's cool. It's cool.

1336
00:50:02.719 --> 00:50:04.794
SAM: I want to say:

1337
00:50:04.794 --> 00:50:08.251
Get off my spider,

1338
00:50:08.251 --> 00:50:09.855
you other spider!

1339
00:50:09.855 --> 00:50:11.755
Nope. I don't have anything.

1340
00:50:11.755 --> 00:50:13.751
LIAM: That's the line.

1341
00:50:13.751 --> 00:50:17.161
SAM: If I could aim for the--
LIAM: (like Nott) I got nothing.

1342
00:50:17.161 --> 00:50:20.236
SAM: For this little penis thing that it shot out.

1343
00:50:20.236 --> 00:50:23.011
MATT: Okay. As its stinger's trying to find the body

1344
00:50:23.011 --> 00:50:25.088
of the spider that it has held there.

1345
00:50:25.088 --> 00:50:27.764
You fire into it and strike the belly

1346
00:50:27.764 --> 00:50:30.488
and you watch as, for some reason,

1347
00:50:30.488 --> 00:50:34.495
the portion that you hit causes its exoskeleton,

1348
00:50:34.495 --> 00:50:38.576
its exterior, to unfold, and its internal organs

1349
00:50:38.576 --> 00:50:40.146
just spill out of it.

1350
00:50:40.146 --> 00:50:41.780
It dizzies for a second and then loses

1351
00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:43.742
hold of Caleb and then falls on the back

1352
00:50:43.742 --> 00:50:44.856
and its legs slowly curl into its body.

1353
00:50:44.856 --> 00:50:46.589
TRAVIS: Yeah! Telltale, behbeh!

1354
00:50:48.133 --> 00:50:50.442
MATT: Now we can use that as your figure.

1355
00:50:50.442 --> 00:50:51.275
LAURA: Yay!

1356
00:50:52.295 --> 00:50:53.822
SAM: Wow.

1357
00:50:53.822 --> 00:50:56.489
MATT: You have a bonus action.

1358
00:50:57.732 --> 00:51:00.194
SAM: I guess I'll fire again

1359
00:51:00.194 --> 00:51:01.895
at the other one next to Caleb.

1360
00:51:01.895 --> 00:51:02.895
MATT: Go for it.

1361
00:51:03.746 --> 00:51:05.139
SAM: That is a 25 to hit.

1362
00:51:05.139 --> 00:51:06.139
MATT: That hits.

1363
00:51:07.079 --> 00:51:10.831
SAM: I get another eight points of damage against that guy.

1364
00:51:10.831 --> 00:51:11.664
MATT: All right.

1365
00:51:11.664 --> 00:51:14.086
That one sinks into it.

1366
00:51:14.086 --> 00:51:17.735
Hurts it, but it (chitters).

1367
00:51:17.735 --> 00:51:20.097
It's still standing.
SAM: Okay.

1368
00:51:20.097 --> 00:51:24.370
Then I'll tuck back around towards Beau.

1369
00:51:24.370 --> 00:51:26.288
MATT: Around this way?
SAM: Yeah, yeah, around that way.

1370
00:51:26.288 --> 00:51:28.125
MATT: Okay, like there or moving all the way around?

1371
00:51:28.125 --> 00:51:29.602
SAM: Just where you got me is good.

1372
00:51:29.602 --> 00:51:30.435
MATT: Okay.

1373
00:51:30.435 --> 00:51:32.170
Fine, that finishes your go, Nott.

1374
00:51:32.170 --> 00:51:33.715
Fucking rogues.

1375
00:51:33.715 --> 00:51:35.779
Caduceus, you're up.

1376
00:51:35.779 --> 00:51:37.637
One round with the mama!

1377
00:51:37.637 --> 00:51:38.662
TRAVIS: Yeah, right?

1378
00:51:38.662 --> 00:51:40.141
TALIESIN: How many spiders are in the room right now?

1379
00:51:40.141 --> 00:51:43.731
MATT: Right now, at a quick glance, you see about eight.

1380
00:51:43.731 --> 00:51:44.564
TALIESIN: All right.

1381
00:51:44.564 --> 00:51:47.078
About eight spiders.
MATT: Yep.

1382
00:51:47.078 --> 00:51:48.488
TALIESIN: Okay.

1383
00:51:48.488 --> 00:51:50.721
I'm going to--

1384
00:51:53.033 --> 00:51:57.866
I suppose I'm going to be basic on this, then.

1385
00:51:59.625 --> 00:52:02.510
Can I do Sacred Flame and Thaumaturgy in the same?

1386
00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:03.598
No, I can't.
MATT: No, they're both actions.

1387
00:52:03.598 --> 00:52:04.439
TALIESIN: They're both actions.

1388
00:52:04.439 --> 00:52:06.214
I don't know why my brain is being dumb.

1389
00:52:08.918 --> 00:52:12.613
I'm in combat with one. Okay, I will--

1390
00:52:12.613 --> 00:52:14.965
yeah, I don't know what's wrong with me.

1391
00:52:14.965 --> 00:52:18.248
I will cast Bless on

1392
00:52:18.248 --> 00:52:22.951
Caleb and on Beau and on Yasha.

1393
00:52:22.951 --> 00:52:23.951
MATT: All righty.

1394
00:52:26.939 --> 00:52:29.844
So Caleb is now a Blessed spider.

1395
00:52:29.844 --> 00:52:32.511
Beau is a Blessed Beau and--

1396
00:52:32.511 --> 00:52:34.128
TALIESIN: Yasha.
MATT: Yasha, Blessed Yasha.

1397
00:52:34.128 --> 00:52:35.385
TALIESIN: Then I guess I'm going to-- I'm not going to

1398
00:52:35.385 --> 00:52:36.935
disengage with the spider I'm currently with,

1399
00:52:36.935 --> 00:52:39.312
but I'm going to put my back against the wall and just--

1400
00:52:39.312 --> 00:52:40.667
MATT: Okay, back up towards the best you can.

1401
00:52:40.667 --> 00:52:42.805
You got it.
TALIESIN: Just be ready for whatever.

1402
00:52:42.805 --> 00:52:44.400
MATT: Cool, that finishes Caduceus' go.

1403
00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:45.645
Fjord, you're up.

1404
00:52:45.645 --> 00:52:49.831
TRAVIS: I will turn and summon the falchion and I will take

1405
00:52:49.831 --> 00:52:53.146
a strike against each one of the spiders next to me.

1406
00:52:53.146 --> 00:52:54.624
One each, just a whoosh whoosh.

1407
00:52:54.624 --> 00:52:55.457
MATT: Go for it.

1408
00:52:55.457 --> 00:52:56.957
One to your right.

1409
00:52:58.027 --> 00:52:59.803
TRAVIS: That is 19 to hit.

1410
00:52:59.803 --> 00:53:01.451
MATT: That hits, go ahead and roll damage.

1411
00:53:01.451 --> 00:53:02.534
TRAVIS: Eight, six.

1412
00:53:04.745 --> 00:53:07.853
Nine points of slashing damage.

1413
00:53:07.853 --> 00:53:09.630
MATT: Arcs through it. It survives,

1414
00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:11.986
but it's looking pretty wounded.

1415
00:53:11.986 --> 00:53:14.649
TRAVIS: Yeah, maybe I'll put the second one

1416
00:53:14.649 --> 00:53:17.205
on the one that just barely survived.

1417
00:53:17.205 --> 00:53:18.038
Can I change that?

1418
00:53:18.038 --> 00:53:18.871
MATT: As the blade goes through,

1419
00:53:18.871 --> 00:53:19.704
you notice that it still survives

1420
00:53:19.704 --> 00:53:20.793
and just change your direction

1421
00:53:20.793 --> 00:53:22.854
and slash it a second time.

1422
00:53:22.854 --> 00:53:23.687
TRAVIS: 14.

1423
00:53:23.687 --> 00:53:25.500
MATT: 14 to hit.
TRAVIS: Oh, did that hit?

1424
00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:26.359
MATT: Uh-huh, that has hit, yeah.

1425
00:53:26.359 --> 00:53:27.400
TRAVIS: Beautiful. Great.

1426
00:53:29.799 --> 00:53:32.019
Better, 14 points of slashing damage.

1427
00:53:32.019 --> 00:53:33.936
MATT: That finishes it off.

1428
00:53:35.052 --> 00:53:37.359
TRAVIS: Might as well reduce my enemy by one.

1429
00:53:37.359 --> 00:53:38.192
MATT: You cut through it a second time,

1430
00:53:38.192 --> 00:53:39.972
bisecting in the front. It cracks in half

1431
00:53:39.972 --> 00:53:42.111
and just falls limp on the ground.

1432
00:53:42.111 --> 00:53:43.661
You still have your movement and your bonus.

1433
00:53:43.661 --> 00:53:44.578
TRAVIS: I will...

1434
00:53:47.546 --> 00:53:49.617
He's on me, right?

1435
00:53:49.617 --> 00:53:51.617
MATT: Correct.
TRAVIS: Yeah, he is.

1436
00:53:52.728 --> 00:53:53.726
That's a bonus action.

1437
00:53:53.726 --> 00:53:56.028
I will, fuck it.

1438
00:53:56.028 --> 00:53:57.592
SAM: You're going to fuck it?

1439
00:53:57.592 --> 00:54:00.522
MATT: That's an action, though.

1440
00:54:00.522 --> 00:54:04.038
TRAVIS: I will move up--

1441
00:54:04.038 --> 00:54:05.654
no, I'll stay there. That's it.

1442
00:54:05.654 --> 00:54:07.494
MATT: Okay, Fjord's turn's over.

1443
00:54:07.494 --> 00:54:09.558
Top of the round. Yasha, you're up.

1444
00:54:09.558 --> 00:54:10.391
ASHLEY: All right.

1445
00:54:10.391 --> 00:54:11.909
MATT: You feel the Bless spell infuse you

1446
00:54:11.909 --> 00:54:14.261
with a little bit of divine guidance.

1447
00:54:14.261 --> 00:54:16.624
ASHLEY: In feeling that spell, I would like to rage.

1448
00:54:16.624 --> 00:54:18.635
MATT: All right. Bonus action rage.

1449
00:54:18.635 --> 00:54:21.831
ASHLEY: Might as well and okay,

1450
00:54:21.831 --> 00:54:25.684
so I'm going to attack. Any little ones around me?

1451
00:54:25.684 --> 00:54:26.632
MATT: There's two around you right now.

1452
00:54:26.632 --> 00:54:27.660
There's one in this corner

1453
00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:29.326
and one on the other.

1454
00:54:29.326 --> 00:54:30.703
ASHLEY: Okay. I'll get the one on the corner.

1455
00:54:30.703 --> 00:54:32.953
Just start with that, okay.

1456
00:54:37.181 --> 00:54:38.014
Okay.

1457
00:54:41.918 --> 00:54:43.336
20 total.

1458
00:54:43.336 --> 00:54:44.317
MATT: Yeah, that definitely hits.

1459
00:54:44.317 --> 00:54:46.400
Go ahead and roll damage.

1460
00:54:49.941 --> 00:54:51.184
LAURA: (laughs)

1461
00:54:51.184 --> 00:54:54.934
ASHLEY: Sorry, just making sure everything is okay.

1462
00:54:56.793 --> 00:54:57.903
LAURA: They're special--
MATT: Yeah, I know,

1463
00:54:57.903 --> 00:54:59.018
they're awesome.
LAURA: They're so cool.

1464
00:54:59.018 --> 00:55:01.518
TALIESIN: They're wigging me out, man.

1465
00:55:02.619 --> 00:55:04.962
ASHLEY: 15 for the first hit.

1466
00:55:04.962 --> 00:55:06.939
MATT: You watch that spider

1467
00:55:06.939 --> 00:55:09.334
just spatter across the corner.

1468
00:55:09.334 --> 00:55:11.426
Curls up as it hits its back.

1469
00:55:11.426 --> 00:55:12.651
LAURA: Jester is golf clapping.

1470
00:55:12.651 --> 00:55:14.813
ASHLEY: I'll take the next-- thanks, Jester.

1471
00:55:14.813 --> 00:55:16.114
I'll take the next shot at the other one.

1472
00:55:16.114 --> 00:55:17.391
MATT: Go for it.

1473
00:55:17.391 --> 00:55:19.019
After slashing through one, you arc over

1474
00:55:19.019 --> 00:55:21.317
and bring it down on top of the other.

1475
00:55:21.317 --> 00:55:24.534
Rolling a...?
ASHLEY: Okay.

1476
00:55:24.534 --> 00:55:26.282
That would be 14.
MATT: 14 hits.

1477
00:55:26.282 --> 00:55:29.593
Go ahead and roll damage for the second strike.

1478
00:55:29.593 --> 00:55:31.046
ASHLEY: Ooh!

1479
00:55:31.046 --> 00:55:31.879
11

1480
00:55:33.308 --> 00:55:34.841
plus.

1481
00:55:39.124 --> 00:55:40.738
Sorry, 14 points of damage.

1482
00:55:40.738 --> 00:55:43.333
MATT: 14, the other one cleaves

1483
00:55:43.333 --> 00:55:44.411
and then goes limp on the ground.

1484
00:55:44.411 --> 00:55:45.394
ASHLEY: Great.

1485
00:55:45.394 --> 00:55:46.754
MATT: You withdraw Magician's Judge

1486
00:55:46.754 --> 00:55:51.039
and its muscles tense up and it expires before you.

1487
00:55:51.039 --> 00:55:52.518
You still have your movement.

1488
00:55:52.518 --> 00:55:55.175
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'm going to start making my way

1489
00:55:55.175 --> 00:55:57.845
towards the rest of the group.

1490
00:55:57.845 --> 00:55:59.555
And any other spider that I can see.

1491
00:55:59.555 --> 00:56:00.710
MATT: There's one right next to Caduceus there.

1492
00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:01.754
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll go over to that one.

1493
00:56:01.754 --> 00:56:02.775
TALIESIN: Oh, thanks.
MATT: All righty.

1494
00:56:02.775 --> 00:56:05.282
You march over there. As you're dragging Magician's Judge,

1495
00:56:05.282 --> 00:56:08.103
it's sparking across the stonework.

1496
00:56:08.103 --> 00:56:11.423
Coming up to it, that finishes your turn. Jester, you're up.

1497
00:56:11.423 --> 00:56:14.941
LAURA: Well, I'm going to move my spiritual weapon

1498
00:56:14.941 --> 00:56:18.816
20 stupid feet towards, god darn it.

1499
00:56:18.816 --> 00:56:19.935
TRAVIS: Hey, there's a spider right there.

1500
00:56:19.935 --> 00:56:21.385
LAURA: There's not.
MATT: There is, yeah.

1501
00:56:21.385 --> 00:56:22.766
LAURA: Hey, cool, I'm going to attack it!

1502
00:56:22.766 --> 00:56:25.016
(laughter)

1503
00:56:27.314 --> 00:56:30.467
LAURA: That's six plus five is only 11.

1504
00:56:30.467 --> 00:56:31.546
No, six plus nine.

1505
00:56:31.546 --> 00:56:32.582
MATT: Yeah, I was like: It's way more than that.

1506
00:56:32.582 --> 00:56:33.682
LAURA: Six plus nine is 15.

1507
00:56:33.682 --> 00:56:34.515
MATT: That hits, roll damage.

1508
00:56:34.515 --> 00:56:36.015
TRAVIS: Yeah!
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, yeah.

1509
00:56:37.873 --> 00:56:41.440
No, those are 10s.

1510
00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:44.736
Ooh, 11 plus five is 16.

1511
00:56:44.736 --> 00:56:47.036
MATT: 16 points of damage.

1512
00:56:47.036 --> 00:56:48.587
Splats.
(cheering)

1513
00:56:48.587 --> 00:56:49.585
MATT: Caduceus, you bring up your shield a bit

1514
00:56:49.585 --> 00:56:50.917
because some of the spatter comes towards you

1515
00:56:50.917 --> 00:56:52.952
and you catch it on the edge.
TALIESIN: Ugh, okay.

1516
00:56:52.952 --> 00:56:54.267
MATT: That is no longer there.
TRAVIS: The spatter

1517
00:56:54.267 --> 00:56:56.365
doesn't burn or anything, right?

1518
00:56:56.365 --> 00:56:59.210
MATT: No, but it feels very warm.
LAURA: Ew.

1519
00:56:59.210 --> 00:57:00.890
SAM: What's with this warmth?

1520
00:57:00.890 --> 00:57:02.781
TRAVIS: What color is it?

1521
00:57:02.781 --> 00:57:04.781
MATT: It's a gray-ish color.

1522
00:57:07.885 --> 00:57:10.367
LAURA: The one next to you, Fjord.

1523
00:57:10.367 --> 00:57:11.200
MATT: Yes.

1524
00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:13.466
LAURA: I'm going to Toll the Dead.

1525
00:57:13.466 --> 00:57:15.914
MATT: Toll the Dead, all right.
LIAM: Spicy burn.

1526
00:57:15.914 --> 00:57:17.690
LAURA: Toll the Dead.

1527
00:57:17.690 --> 00:57:18.839
MATT: A natural 18.

1528
00:57:18.839 --> 00:57:22.058
LAURA: Ah, it saves against it.
MATT: Sorry.

1529
00:57:22.058 --> 00:57:24.996
All right, that finishes your turn, Jester.

1530
00:57:24.996 --> 00:57:27.337
Mom's dead. Beau, you're up.

1531
00:57:27.337 --> 00:57:30.480
MARISHA: I'm going to take out the staff and do a little,

1532
00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:32.848
little golf swing to both of these guys.

1533
00:57:32.848 --> 00:57:35.088
MATT: Go for it.
MARISHA: First one.

1534
00:57:35.088 --> 00:57:36.098
27.

1535
00:57:36.098 --> 00:57:37.431
MATT: 27 hits, yeah.

1536
00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:42.447
MARISHA: 14.

1537
00:57:42.447 --> 00:57:44.858
MATT: 14, the first swing, crack!

1538
00:57:44.858 --> 00:57:45.852
It sends up into the corner.

1539
00:57:45.852 --> 00:57:47.451
It hits the stone, falls to the ground,

1540
00:57:47.451 --> 00:57:49.561
and curls up dead.

1541
00:57:49.561 --> 00:57:50.394
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1542
00:57:50.394 --> 00:57:51.604
LAURA: I think we're getting cocky here.

1543
00:57:51.604 --> 00:57:53.809
MARISHA: I'm going to do a

1544
00:57:53.809 --> 00:57:55.828
lightsaber spin, come around, pop the other one.

1545
00:57:55.828 --> 00:57:57.928
TRAVIS: Ooh, I like it.

1546
00:57:58.910 --> 00:57:59.743
MARISHA: 15.

1547
00:57:59.743 --> 00:58:02.988
MATT: 15 hits, go ahead and roll damage.

1548
00:58:02.988 --> 00:58:04.669
MARISHA: Ooh, seven.

1549
00:58:04.669 --> 00:58:06.889
MATT: Seven, crack! You do manage to smack it

1550
00:58:06.889 --> 00:58:09.493
and you see one of its legs curl up underneath.

1551
00:58:09.493 --> 00:58:13.141
You've damaged one of its legs, but it has seven more.

1552
00:58:13.141 --> 00:58:15.446
You still have your bonus action.

1553
00:58:15.446 --> 00:58:16.345
MARISHA: Hit it again.

1554
00:58:16.345 --> 00:58:17.978
MATT: Go for it.

1555
00:58:17.978 --> 00:58:19.715
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil.

1556
00:58:19.715 --> 00:58:22.188
A natural one.
(laughter)

1557
00:58:22.188 --> 00:58:24.530
No, wait, it's a three, still fucky.

1558
00:58:24.530 --> 00:58:25.619
MATT: All right, so what's the total?

1559
00:58:25.619 --> 00:58:27.254
MARISHA: 13.
MATT: 13 hits.

1560
00:58:27.254 --> 00:58:29.152
MARISHA: It hits?!

1561
00:58:29.152 --> 00:58:31.943
Aw, awesome. Thanks, Gil!

1562
00:58:35.232 --> 00:58:36.361
13 damage.

1563
00:58:36.361 --> 00:58:39.124
MATT: 13, after you hit the one leg,

1564
00:58:39.124 --> 00:58:41.223
it rears back and leaps towards you,

1565
00:58:41.223 --> 00:58:43.431
and you slip down and whack!

1566
00:58:43.431 --> 00:58:45.611
Hit it in the abdomen so hard it slides over

1567
00:58:45.611 --> 00:58:48.589
and slams into the ground, sticks into one of the webs,

1568
00:58:48.589 --> 00:58:51.628
on its backside. It doesn't adhere to the web,

1569
00:58:51.628 --> 00:58:53.942
so it slowly curls off it like dull Velcro

1570
00:58:53.942 --> 00:58:55.982
and hits the ground not moving.

1571
00:58:55.982 --> 00:58:58.873
SAM: I hope Gil doesn't actually watch the show.

1572
00:58:58.873 --> 00:59:02.007
because it's like a rollercoaster for him.

1573
00:59:02.007 --> 00:59:04.287
MATT: We love him, though.

1574
00:59:04.287 --> 00:59:05.714
TRAVIS: He knew what he was getting into.

1575
00:59:05.714 --> 00:59:06.547
MARISHA: Yeah.

1576
00:59:06.547 --> 00:59:08.998
TRAVIS: He knew what he was getting into.

1577
00:59:08.998 --> 00:59:12.050
LIAM: He's hearing about fucking every week.

1578
00:59:12.050 --> 00:59:13.649
MARISHA: Is it there's one more?
MATT: You have one more attack

1579
00:59:13.649 --> 00:59:15.537
with your bonus action.
TRAVIS: Getting some action.

1580
00:59:15.537 --> 00:59:17.430
MATT: There's two more. There's one next to

1581
00:59:17.430 --> 00:59:18.272
the spider Caleb--
MARISHA: Well, no,

1582
00:59:18.272 --> 00:59:19.432
I didn't do Flurry of Blows.

1583
00:59:19.432 --> 00:59:20.477
MATT: Oh, that's right, you did not, sorry.

1584
00:59:20.477 --> 00:59:22.782
So yeah, so you can move.

1585
00:59:22.782 --> 00:59:24.509
MARISHA: Oh, there's the one by Caleb.

1586
00:59:24.509 --> 00:59:26.685
And the one by Fjord?
MATT: Yes.

1587
00:59:26.685 --> 00:59:27.518
MARISHA: Yeah.

1588
00:59:30.379 --> 00:59:31.604
Yeah, I'll--

1589
00:59:36.255 --> 00:59:37.971
I'm going by the one by Caleb just in case it goes bad--

1590
00:59:37.971 --> 00:59:39.304
TRAVIS: Look at the size of its ass.

1591
00:59:39.304 --> 00:59:41.651
Look at it, it's bigger than me.

1592
00:59:41.651 --> 00:59:44.066
MARISHA: But you got, you're surrounded by friends!

1593
00:59:44.066 --> 00:59:46.735
TRAVIS: One of them's not even real.

1594
00:59:46.735 --> 00:59:47.568
MATT: Don't forget, you are Blessed,

1595
00:59:47.568 --> 00:59:49.393
so you get to add d4 to your attacks, too.

1596
00:59:49.393 --> 00:59:51.005
MARISHA: Oh, shit.

1597
00:59:51.005 --> 00:59:53.670
MATT: You hit with all of them so you're fine, but there.

1598
00:59:53.670 --> 00:59:55.517
Yeah, you're next to it, fine.

1599
00:59:55.517 --> 00:59:58.695
You rush up and get to the one next to Caleb

1600
00:59:58.695 --> 00:59:59.801
and that's your turn.
MARISHA: Yep.

1601
00:59:59.801 --> 01:00:02.551
MATT: All right, it's now their turn.

1602
01:00:03.771 --> 01:00:06.244
Roll a d6 for me, Jester. On a one to three,

1603
01:00:06.244 --> 01:00:08.534
it targets Fjord. On a four to six,

1604
01:00:08.534 --> 01:00:11.502
it targets your illusionary self.

1605
01:00:11.502 --> 01:00:14.382
LAURA: On a one to three, it targets Fjord?

1606
01:00:14.382 --> 01:00:16.038
Six!
MARISHA: Yay!

1607
01:00:16.038 --> 01:00:18.729
MATT: It turns around and strikes out with its fangs,

1608
01:00:18.729 --> 01:00:23.729
passing through the illusory Jester, withdraws confused.

1609
01:00:23.970 --> 01:00:26.409
The other one's going to go after you, Caleb.

1610
01:00:26.409 --> 01:00:29.659
MARISHA: Sentinel attack.
SAM: Ooh.

1611
01:00:29.659 --> 01:00:30.612
MATT: All right.

1612
01:00:33.525 --> 01:00:34.745
TALIESIN: Plus d4.

1613
01:00:34.745 --> 01:00:36.496
MARISHA: Plus a d4, that's 25.

1614
01:00:36.496 --> 01:00:38.464
MATT: Yeah, that hits.

1615
01:00:38.464 --> 01:00:41.405
Go ahead and roll damage.

1616
01:00:41.405 --> 01:00:42.839
MARISHA: 10.
MATT: 10 points of damage.

1617
01:00:42.839 --> 01:00:43.697
Crack!

1618
01:00:43.697 --> 01:00:45.377
You slam into it with your staff, but it survives.

1619
01:00:45.377 --> 01:00:48.101
It's really hurt. It still strikes out towards you

1620
01:00:48.101 --> 01:00:50.402
and that's going to be an 18 to hit.

1621
01:00:50.402 --> 01:00:52.169
LIAM: I don't know what the AC is, a giant spider?

1622
01:00:52.169 --> 01:00:53.104
MATT: Giant spider should be in your deck.

1623
01:00:53.104 --> 01:00:55.977
LIAM: Well, I didn't know if it was a special spider or not,

1624
01:00:55.977 --> 01:00:58.920
so 14, does hit.
MATT: Okay.

1625
01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:01.367
So you took the same form as the mother.

1626
01:01:01.367 --> 01:01:02.568
LIAM: As the mother, yeah, well, that's what I--

1627
01:01:02.568 --> 01:01:03.875
MATT: Technically, it's not a beast,

1628
01:01:03.875 --> 01:01:05.233
so you would not be able to.
LIAM: That was my question.

1629
01:01:05.233 --> 01:01:06.528
If not that, then giant spider.

1630
01:01:06.528 --> 01:01:07.729
MATT: Yeah, so you turn into a giant spider

1631
01:01:07.729 --> 01:01:09.204
that looks like--

1632
01:01:09.204 --> 01:01:10.716
but you don't know the actual.

1633
01:01:10.716 --> 01:01:13.092
LIAM: So AC is 14, that hits.

1634
01:01:13.092 --> 01:01:15.813
MATT: Okay, that hits.
TRAVIS: It's attacking its "mother".

1635
01:01:15.813 --> 01:01:17.542
LAURA: I don't believe it.

1636
01:01:17.542 --> 01:01:18.709
SAM: So Freudian.

1637
01:01:21.768 --> 01:01:23.162
MATT: You know what, that's a valid point.

1638
01:01:23.162 --> 01:01:24.141
You look kind of like its mom.

1639
01:01:24.141 --> 01:01:26.075
I'll give disadvantage on the attack.

1640
01:01:28.781 --> 01:01:30.068
That's a 15.

1641
01:01:30.068 --> 01:01:31.485
So it still hits.

1642
01:01:33.215 --> 01:01:35.495
Your giant spider form takes five points piercing damage.

1643
01:01:35.495 --> 01:01:36.406
LIAM: Okay.

1644
01:01:36.406 --> 01:01:38.880
MATT: And four points of poison damage.

1645
01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:41.570
LIAM: This spider says it's poisonous, so would it be

1646
01:01:41.570 --> 01:01:45.029
affected or it's a different kind of poison that affects?

1647
01:01:45.029 --> 01:01:47.072
MATT: It's a different kind of poison, this one.

1648
01:01:47.072 --> 01:01:49.658
Does it have resistance to poison or an immunity to poison?

1649
01:01:49.658 --> 01:01:51.601
LIAM: Well, it just has a poisonous bite, so--

1650
01:01:51.601 --> 01:01:52.968
MATT: Correct, so the poison still affects it.

1651
01:01:52.968 --> 01:01:53.835
LIAM: Got it.
MATT: Okay.

1652
01:01:53.835 --> 01:01:56.068
That finishes its turn.

1653
01:01:56.068 --> 01:01:57.217
TRAVIS: These blood spiders--

1654
01:01:57.217 --> 01:01:58.095
MATT: They're both going to stay there.

1655
01:01:58.095 --> 01:01:59.007
This one's actually going to move around

1656
01:01:59.007 --> 01:02:00.918
after being hit by Beau.

1657
01:02:00.918 --> 01:02:03.360
It's going to try and skitter around this side.

1658
01:02:05.487 --> 01:02:06.472
No, you know what, it's going to go ahead

1659
01:02:06.472 --> 01:02:08.474
and scoot up the wall.

1660
01:02:08.474 --> 01:02:09.469
Try and get away from this scenario,

1661
01:02:09.469 --> 01:02:12.627
so now it's up in trying to crawl back into its space.

1662
01:02:12.627 --> 01:02:13.838
You do get an attack of opportunity if you want to take.

1663
01:02:13.838 --> 01:02:15.303
LIAM: Yeah, I will bite its abdomen.

1664
01:02:15.303 --> 01:02:17.738
MATT: Go for it. Roll for an attack.

1665
01:02:17.738 --> 01:02:19.787
LAURA: Now I feel bad for it.
LIAM: I do not at all.

1666
01:02:19.787 --> 01:02:22.287
TALIESIN: You also have the d4, though.

1667
01:02:23.708 --> 01:02:25.257
LAURA: He just wants to go home.
LIAM: 14.

1668
01:02:25.257 --> 01:02:27.146
MATT: 14 hits, roll damage.
TRAVIS: Nice.

1669
01:02:27.146 --> 01:02:28.254
MARISHA: Kill it.

1670
01:02:28.254 --> 01:02:29.087
Kill it!

1671
01:02:29.087 --> 01:02:31.320
LIAM: (muttering) --range.

1672
01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:33.947
TALIESIN: Just one of those emergency...

1673
01:02:39.207 --> 01:02:41.753
LIAM: That is an eight and then it has to make

1674
01:02:41.753 --> 01:02:43.023
a poison save itself.

1675
01:02:43.023 --> 01:02:44.130
MATT: That's enough. Between that and the bow attack,

1676
01:02:44.130 --> 01:02:45.171
you kill it.
SAM: Yeah.

1677
01:02:45.171 --> 01:02:47.455
MATT: It tries to skitter away and you grab it

1678
01:02:47.455 --> 01:02:51.758
and snap the fangs into it and it falls limp in your grip

1679
01:02:51.758 --> 01:02:52.591
and fangs.

1680
01:02:53.489 --> 01:02:54.413
TALIESIN: Poor spider.

1681
01:02:54.413 --> 01:02:56.172
LAURA: Poor spider.

1682
01:02:56.172 --> 01:02:57.888
MATT: So--
SAM: Is that all of them?

1683
01:02:57.888 --> 01:02:59.343
LIAM: Nope, there's one left.
MATT: Oh, there is one left.

1684
01:02:59.343 --> 01:03:01.736
You're right.
ASHLEY: There's two.

1685
01:03:01.736 --> 01:03:03.392
Right?
MATT: There's one now.

1686
01:03:03.392 --> 01:03:05.458
TRAVIS: That's Caleb.

1687
01:03:05.458 --> 01:03:07.827
SAM: There's one left!
MATT: It's just Caleb.

1688
01:03:07.827 --> 01:03:09.843
That was it running away from you. Caleb, it's your turn.

1689
01:03:09.843 --> 01:03:10.825
TRAVIS: Kill that fucking big spider!

1690
01:03:10.825 --> 01:03:13.672
LIAM: Where is this thing's speed?

1691
01:03:13.672 --> 01:03:16.548
Okay, so covered in ichor and guts,

1692
01:03:16.548 --> 01:03:20.150
I spin around in place and see one across the way

1693
01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:21.885
and I am angry, so I am going to

1694
01:03:21.885 --> 01:03:24.102
just go jump on its abdomen and bite it as well.

1695
01:03:24.102 --> 01:03:26.245
TRAVIS: No, no, no, no!
ASHLEY: Big butt.

1696
01:03:26.245 --> 01:03:28.669
MATT: Fjord, you watch as a giant mom spider

1697
01:03:28.669 --> 01:03:30.828
comes leaping in your direction.

1698
01:03:30.828 --> 01:03:31.837
TRAVIS: Fuck this place!

1699
01:03:31.837 --> 01:03:33.806
MATT: (laughs)

1700
01:03:33.806 --> 01:03:34.806
LIAM: Plus four.

1701
01:03:36.277 --> 01:03:38.351
Six, oh, that's a low roll, though.

1702
01:03:38.351 --> 01:03:41.434
That is 11. It doesn't hit.
MATT: 11 does not hit.

1703
01:03:41.434 --> 01:03:42.978
MATT: No.
TALIESIN: Is that with the d4 even?

1704
01:03:42.978 --> 01:03:44.063
LIAM: Yep.
TALIESIN: Oh.

1705
01:03:44.063 --> 01:03:46.284
MATT: Now there's a baby and mama coming at you, Fjord.

1706
01:03:46.284 --> 01:03:47.433
TRAVIS: Nott, save me!

1707
01:03:47.433 --> 01:03:48.696
MATT: Nott, it's your turn.

1708
01:03:48.696 --> 01:03:50.159
SAM: Oh, wow.

1709
01:03:50.159 --> 01:03:52.126
Has that one taken any damage?

1710
01:03:52.126 --> 01:03:53.003
MATT: The one that's by Fjord?

1711
01:03:53.003 --> 01:03:54.347
SAM: Yeah.
MATT: It has not.

1712
01:03:54.347 --> 01:03:55.259
SAM: Oh, boy.

1713
01:03:55.259 --> 01:03:57.926
I will shoot it with a crossbow.

1714
01:03:59.818 --> 01:04:00.758
27 to hit.

1715
01:04:00.758 --> 01:04:03.004
MATT: That definitely hits. Jesus.

1716
01:04:03.004 --> 01:04:04.504
ASHLEY: This is amazing.

1717
01:04:06.373 --> 01:04:07.559
ASHLEY: Yep.
SAM: Not as good,

1718
01:04:07.559 --> 01:04:09.129
but pretty good.
LIAM: Pretty good, still.

1719
01:04:09.129 --> 01:04:11.088
TALIESIN: I mean--
LAURA: Jeez.

1720
01:04:11.088 --> 01:04:12.443
TALIESIN: Ew.

1721
01:04:12.443 --> 01:04:14.232
SAM: 30 points of damage.

1722
01:04:14.232 --> 01:04:15.275
TALIESIN: That's just gross.

1723
01:04:15.275 --> 01:04:17.462
MATT: It leaps up and Fjord catches it in the air

1724
01:04:17.462 --> 01:04:19.260
and you watch, all of a sudden, (whooshes)

1725
01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:20.962
this bolt emerges from its head.

1726
01:04:20.962 --> 01:04:22.629
It splatters on you.

1727
01:04:23.914 --> 01:04:26.361
It's hot. It's not scalding, but it goes

1728
01:04:26.361 --> 01:04:29.494
and it's like, ho, that's uncomfortably hot.

1729
01:04:29.494 --> 01:04:31.228
TRAVIS: Why is it so warm?

1730
01:04:31.228 --> 01:04:35.895
SAM: I'm going to say, we came to crash your website!

1731
01:04:35.895 --> 01:04:38.327
Is what I meant to say the last time.

1732
01:04:38.327 --> 01:04:39.160
TALIESIN: I don't get it.
LAURA: No.

1733
01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:40.414
SAM: Just think about it

1734
01:04:40.414 --> 01:04:41.567
for a while.
TRAVIS: All of 12 seconds

1735
01:04:41.567 --> 01:04:43.557
to think of that, huh?

1736
01:04:43.557 --> 01:04:45.742
LIAM: This is why Nott can't be president.

1737
01:04:45.742 --> 01:04:47.014
MATT: You look and see the giant mom spider

1738
01:04:47.014 --> 01:04:49.091
curled around the corner

1739
01:04:49.091 --> 01:04:50.723
and it's facing off against Fjord. What are you doing?

1740
01:04:50.723 --> 01:04:53.819
TALIESIN: I mean, I saw the transformation, so I'm not too

1741
01:04:53.819 --> 01:04:54.875
worried about that.

1742
01:04:54.875 --> 01:04:55.860
LIAM: High perception.

1743
01:04:55.860 --> 01:04:56.847
MATT: With your perception, you did notice.

1744
01:04:56.847 --> 01:04:58.676
TALIESIN: Yeah, I saw that. I saw that go down.

1745
01:04:58.676 --> 01:05:00.417
There's a reason I put Bless on the spider.

1746
01:05:00.417 --> 01:05:01.584
MATT: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1747
01:05:03.130 --> 01:05:06.547
Hey, Caleb, I think you might be able to--

1748
01:05:07.582 --> 01:05:10.437
I think you can check out some of these nooks and crannies--

1749
01:05:10.437 --> 01:05:12.581
TRAVIS: Oh, don't do that!

1750
01:05:12.581 --> 01:05:14.110
TALIESIN: See if everything's copacetic.

1751
01:05:14.110 --> 01:05:15.107
LAURA: No!

1752
01:05:15.107 --> 01:05:17.240
TRAVIS: Don't go down into the snake hole!

1753
01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:21.148
TALIESIN: Just a little, a little peak.

1754
01:05:21.148 --> 01:05:23.169
Don't go too deep in there or anything.

1755
01:05:23.169 --> 01:05:24.936
Technically, he can understand everything I'm saying.

1756
01:05:24.936 --> 01:05:26.879
MATT: That's true.
LAURA: Technically, he can.

1757
01:05:28.179 --> 01:05:29.119
MATT: Fjord, your turn.

1758
01:05:29.119 --> 01:05:31.096
Caduceus starts talking to the spider as Caleb.

1759
01:05:31.096 --> 01:05:33.801
TRAVIS: Did I see Caleb turn into the spider?

1760
01:05:33.801 --> 01:05:36.250
MATT: I'd say you weren't paying attention at the moment,

1761
01:05:36.250 --> 01:05:39.654
but it's not currently looking aggressive

1762
01:05:39.654 --> 01:05:42.605
and Caduceus is talking towards it and it seems to react.

1763
01:05:42.605 --> 01:05:45.245
You figure it out, You're not a complete imbecile.

1764
01:05:45.245 --> 01:05:47.023
TRAVIS: All right.
MATT: You're pretty clever.

1765
01:05:48.665 --> 01:05:50.681
TRAVIS: Can I recommend that we

1766
01:05:50.681 --> 01:05:52.589
get the fuck out of this room?

1767
01:05:52.589 --> 01:05:53.813
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: All right.

1768
01:05:53.813 --> 01:05:54.963
TALIESIN: We're going to have to be very careful.

1769
01:05:54.963 --> 01:05:56.156
TRAVIS: I'll start walking.

1770
01:05:56.156 --> 01:05:58.697
LIAM: So all enemies are gone--
SAM: Don't start walking.

1771
01:05:58.697 --> 01:06:00.388
We need to burn our way through.

1772
01:06:00.388 --> 01:06:01.614
Light a torch or something.

1773
01:06:01.614 --> 01:06:04.445
LIAM: The Caleb spider starts to--

1774
01:06:04.445 --> 01:06:07.805
the Caleb Widow--
SAM: The Widogast?

1775
01:06:07.805 --> 01:06:09.858
MARISHA: The Widogast, yeah.

1776
01:06:09.858 --> 01:06:12.605
LIAM: Widogast Widow crawls over and starts pulling away

1777
01:06:12.605 --> 01:06:16.305
a web, looking through where all that rubble is

1778
01:06:16.305 --> 01:06:18.447
that Laura asked about earlier.

1779
01:06:18.447 --> 01:06:20.045
MATT: Okay, so the rubble here?

1780
01:06:20.045 --> 01:06:22.113
LIAM: Yeah, at the web, I'm pulling away.

1781
01:06:22.113 --> 01:06:22.973
MATT: Okay, so you're pulling it away.

1782
01:06:22.973 --> 01:06:26.206
There is all manner of broken stone,

1783
01:06:27.262 --> 01:06:29.512
compact earth.

1784
01:06:29.512 --> 01:06:31.274
This is a cave in. This is a section where

1785
01:06:31.274 --> 01:06:33.045
a part of it just fell in.

1786
01:06:33.045 --> 01:06:36.209
LAURA: What about the sacs?
ASHLEY: Yeah, the sacs.

1787
01:06:36.209 --> 01:06:37.086
MATT: We'll get to that.

1788
01:06:37.086 --> 01:06:38.622
Down here, you don't see any bodies.

1789
01:06:38.622 --> 01:06:41.330
All you find are clusters of webbing

1790
01:06:41.330 --> 01:06:44.978
and that weird, dried mud-like thing

1791
01:06:44.978 --> 01:06:47.405
that's built in sections.
LIAM: Okay.

1792
01:06:47.405 --> 01:06:51.530
MATT: Like piles of it and bits of it are cracked.

1793
01:06:51.530 --> 01:06:55.547
LIAM: Okay, then the next thing is to crawl up to the

1794
01:06:55.547 --> 01:06:57.970
ceiling and move to the closest one of these places

1795
01:06:57.970 --> 01:06:58.993
that you described as having

1796
01:06:58.993 --> 01:07:00.336
the bundles that we can't see past.

1797
01:07:00.336 --> 01:07:02.820
LAURA: Be careful, they might be egg sacs or something.

1798
01:07:02.820 --> 01:07:04.427
TRAVIS: Oh, please, don't do that.

1799
01:07:04.427 --> 01:07:05.519
Don't.

1800
01:07:05.519 --> 01:07:07.408
No, look, I saw that happen one summer.

1801
01:07:07.408 --> 01:07:09.241
It's fucking terrible.

1802
01:07:10.902 --> 01:07:13.343
LAURA: There was one time--
TRAVIS: Don't pop egg sacs.

1803
01:07:13.343 --> 01:07:14.264
LAURA: There was one time there was a spider--

1804
01:07:14.264 --> 01:07:15.291
TRAVIS: Don't tell this story.
LAURA: On the ground.

1805
01:07:15.291 --> 01:07:16.243
I have to.

1806
01:07:16.243 --> 01:07:17.991
There was a spider on the ground

1807
01:07:17.991 --> 01:07:19.612
and I stepped-- I was wearing flip flops,

1808
01:07:19.612 --> 01:07:23.444
and I stepped on it, and out from underneath it,

1809
01:07:23.444 --> 01:07:26.596
came a thousand little teeny baby spiders

1810
01:07:26.596 --> 01:07:28.900
and they all went (squish) and over my foot

1811
01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:30.950
because I was in flip flops!
SAM: (yells)

1812
01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:32.524
Oh, how old were you?

1813
01:07:32.524 --> 01:07:34.511
LAURA: Like 20-something.
SAM: Oh!

1814
01:07:34.511 --> 01:07:36.348
Well, that's normal.
MATT: So Jester.

1815
01:07:36.348 --> 01:07:37.181
LAURA: Yes.

1816
01:07:37.181 --> 01:07:38.785
MATT: As you step forward--
TRAVIS: No!

1817
01:07:39.785 --> 01:07:41.547
Don't.
TALIESIN: Jester just told that story,

1818
01:07:41.547 --> 01:07:43.825
though, so now flip flops are D&amp;D canon.

1819
01:07:43.825 --> 01:07:45.648
MATT: While Caleb as a spider is slowly

1820
01:07:45.648 --> 01:07:47.856
climbing through elements of the space,

1821
01:07:47.856 --> 01:07:48.765
are you guys doing anything?

1822
01:07:48.765 --> 01:07:50.733
TALIESIN: I am keeping an eye out

1823
01:07:50.733 --> 01:07:54.094
and thinking about how to get rid of webs.

1824
01:07:54.094 --> 01:07:55.670
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: I am going to--

1825
01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:57.263
MATT: Perception check.
LAURA: --be keeping an eye on

1826
01:07:57.263 --> 01:07:58.872
the holes, like looking for other holes

1827
01:07:58.872 --> 01:08:00.790
that spiders might come out of and stuff, too.

1828
01:08:00.790 --> 01:08:01.870
MATT: Perception.
ASHLEY: I'm going to pick up

1829
01:08:01.870 --> 01:08:04.892
some of the spiders--
TALIESIN: Ooh, 25.

1830
01:08:04.892 --> 01:08:07.158
SAM: You're picking up some of the spiders?

1831
01:08:07.158 --> 01:08:09.741
ASHLEY: Well, just so we have dinner, you know?

1832
01:08:10.597 --> 01:08:11.430
LAURA: 23!

1833
01:08:11.430 --> 01:08:12.444
ASHLEY: We all should be hungry later.

1834
01:08:12.444 --> 01:08:13.905
MATT: 23, okay.

1835
01:08:13.905 --> 01:08:15.854
You look at the alcoves where they were

1836
01:08:15.854 --> 01:08:19.448
coming out of and glance over and look in.

1837
01:08:19.448 --> 01:08:20.865
They're not deep.

1838
01:08:21.820 --> 01:08:23.361
You look inside and there are elements

1839
01:08:23.361 --> 01:08:25.305
still being pushed up in there,

1840
01:08:25.305 --> 01:08:28.535
other small sacs, and as you're pulling apart

1841
01:08:28.535 --> 01:08:30.799
some of the-- where are you right now?

1842
01:08:30.799 --> 01:08:31.632
You're in the center of the room?

1843
01:08:31.632 --> 01:08:32.924
LIAM: Well, what you described initially,

1844
01:08:32.924 --> 01:08:34.857
which was these sacks and bundles,

1845
01:08:34.857 --> 01:08:35.690
I guess what you just described--

1846
01:08:35.690 --> 01:08:36.523
MATT: Okay, so you're going to those.

1847
01:08:36.523 --> 01:08:37.356
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

1848
01:08:37.356 --> 01:08:39.892
So as you're tearing them open and pulling them apart,

1849
01:08:39.892 --> 01:08:43.031
it takes a bit of time because they're strong.

1850
01:08:43.031 --> 01:08:46.216
But they're also loose, if that makes sense.

1851
01:08:46.216 --> 01:08:47.573
As you open up and look on the inside,

1852
01:08:47.573 --> 01:08:52.573
there's more of that weird muddy, caked material

1853
01:08:52.695 --> 01:08:55.949
that's dried and it's all

1854
01:08:55.949 --> 01:08:57.367
on the inside of these sacs.

1855
01:08:57.367 --> 01:09:00.006
You also find in one of them--

1856
01:09:00.006 --> 01:09:01.390
actually, make an investigation check for me,

1857
01:09:01.390 --> 01:09:02.418
if you could, as a spider.

1858
01:09:02.418 --> 01:09:04.808
LIAM: As a spider, damn.
MATT: Yeah.

1859
01:09:04.808 --> 01:09:06.904
LIAM: Not so good-- ooh!

1860
01:09:06.904 --> 01:09:09.029
That is a 17.

1861
01:09:09.029 --> 01:09:10.844
MATT: 17.
LIAM: No, no.

1862
01:09:10.844 --> 01:09:12.645
That's a bigger subtraction, 15.

1863
01:09:12.645 --> 01:09:14.890
MATT: 15. That's actually still pretty good, though.

1864
01:09:14.890 --> 01:09:18.517
You go through a few of these and you find

1865
01:09:18.517 --> 01:09:23.442
dark metal daggers, you find pieces of weapons and armor,

1866
01:09:25.546 --> 01:09:28.721
and you find old leather that is all of that caked

1867
01:09:28.721 --> 01:09:32.493
in this dark, brown, red mud.

1868
01:09:32.493 --> 01:09:34.259
LIAM: I would be just going like--

1869
01:09:34.259 --> 01:09:35.240
MATT: Yeah, trying to go, ting, ting, ting, ting.

1870
01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:36.326
LIAM: --chucking it down into the room.

1871
01:09:36.326 --> 01:09:37.947
MATT: One gets stuck in the web

1872
01:09:37.947 --> 01:09:39.680
and hangs there for a second.

1873
01:09:40.647 --> 01:09:45.219
You do find one belt that has

1874
01:09:45.219 --> 01:09:48.894
an iron ring on it and a large key

1875
01:09:48.894 --> 01:09:51.188
hanging from it that was inside one of these

1876
01:09:53.313 --> 01:09:54.483
and then scatters across the ground.

1877
01:09:54.483 --> 01:09:57.434
LAURA: I go pick up the key.
MATT: Okay.

1878
01:09:57.434 --> 01:09:59.767
MARISHA: I'm going to start trying to,

1879
01:10:01.454 --> 01:10:04.795
you know, Mission Impossible through the webs

1880
01:10:04.795 --> 01:10:05.628
to the other side of the door.
TRAVIS: I'll grab that

1881
01:10:05.628 --> 01:10:07.296
little dagger just so--
MATT: Okay.

1882
01:10:07.296 --> 01:10:09.115
You grab it. It's got stuff on it

1883
01:10:09.115 --> 01:10:12.112
and comes off like dried dirt, rubbing off.

1884
01:10:12.112 --> 01:10:13.405
TRAVIS: Flakes off or dusts off?

1885
01:10:13.405 --> 01:10:15.322
MATT: It flakes off.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1886
01:10:17.254 --> 01:10:19.062
MATT: You guys give a pass of the room.

1887
01:10:19.062 --> 01:10:19.969
You look over in the back corner

1888
01:10:19.969 --> 01:10:21.524
of the mama coming out of that whole upper area

1889
01:10:21.524 --> 01:10:22.486
where it had collapsed inward.

1890
01:10:22.486 --> 01:10:25.361
Looks like there's a larger alcove in that area.

1891
01:10:29.407 --> 01:10:32.968
TALIESIN: Caleb, maybe take a look in the big alcove.

1892
01:10:32.968 --> 01:10:34.962
Don't go too deep in there or anything.

1893
01:10:34.962 --> 01:10:36.535
Just get a sense of what's in there,

1894
01:10:36.535 --> 01:10:40.910
if there's anything living in there, maybe.

1895
01:10:40.910 --> 01:10:42.952
LIAM: (gurgling)

1896
01:10:42.952 --> 01:10:44.185
TALIESIN: I don't know what that means,

1897
01:10:44.185 --> 01:10:45.735
but I assume that's okay.

1898
01:10:45.735 --> 01:10:48.816
MATT: You skitter up, up into the space.

1899
01:10:48.816 --> 01:10:49.649
LIAM: Here, give me yours.

1900
01:10:49.649 --> 01:10:52.132
MATT: (laughs)

1901
01:10:52.132 --> 01:10:54.299
As you make your way in,

1902
01:10:55.216 --> 01:10:58.480
same thing, you see the caked mud everywhere.

1903
01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:01.955
You see one very large sac

1904
01:11:01.955 --> 01:11:03.471
that's pressed into the corner.

1905
01:11:03.471 --> 01:11:04.472
Coloration's a little different

1906
01:11:04.472 --> 01:11:05.305
from the ones that you were

1907
01:11:05.305 --> 01:11:06.752
rummaging through earlier.

1908
01:11:06.752 --> 01:11:09.224
LIAM: (gurgling)

1909
01:11:09.224 --> 01:11:10.342
I have an intelligence of two.

1910
01:11:10.342 --> 01:11:12.513
MATT: I know, make a perception check.

1911
01:11:13.721 --> 01:11:16.847
TRAVIS: The mud has a brownish color, grayish color?

1912
01:11:16.847 --> 01:11:20.108
MATT: Like brown-red, like a ruddy feel.

1913
01:11:20.108 --> 01:11:21.675
Three.

1914
01:11:21.675 --> 01:11:23.756
Looking around inside, you don't see much else

1915
01:11:23.756 --> 01:11:25.580
other than just this large sac that's

1916
01:11:25.580 --> 01:11:27.644
adhered against the wall and slightly upward

1917
01:11:27.644 --> 01:11:29.121
and it has heavy strands holding it.

1918
01:11:29.121 --> 01:11:31.892
It's hanging a little bit, bulbous.

1919
01:11:31.892 --> 01:11:32.816
TRAVIS: Can I reach down and just

1920
01:11:32.816 --> 01:11:35.237
scoop some of the mud and smell it?

1921
01:11:35.237 --> 01:11:38.232
MATT: Yeah, you go ahead and you pull it and

1922
01:11:38.232 --> 01:11:39.562
pick it up and smell it. It flakes away

1923
01:11:39.562 --> 01:11:41.804
and crumbles like a dull dirt.

1924
01:11:43.387 --> 01:11:44.554
Has a

1925
01:11:46.363 --> 01:11:50.971
tinny, metallic smell, but also like a sulfurous

1926
01:11:50.971 --> 01:11:53.304
smell to it.
TRAVIS: Again.

1927
01:11:57.815 --> 01:12:00.398
TALIESIN: Do I get the sense that it...

1928
01:12:05.147 --> 01:12:07.350
I don't know how to put this properly.

1929
01:12:07.350 --> 01:12:08.565
Are we all right in here?

1930
01:12:08.565 --> 01:12:09.848
I don't know how to put that other than

1931
01:12:09.848 --> 01:12:14.848
this mud-- is any of this stuff feeling caustic?

1932
01:12:15.204 --> 01:12:16.600
SAM: Chernobyl-y?

1933
01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:19.002
MATT: (chuckles) Make a medicine check, if you want to look

1934
01:12:19.002 --> 01:12:20.671
at it and see if there's anything organic about it.

1935
01:12:20.671 --> 01:12:22.038
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'll make a medicine check.

1936
01:12:22.038 --> 01:12:24.749
MARISHA: Am I able to ascertain--
TALIESIN: 15.

1937
01:12:24.749 --> 01:12:26.000
MATT: Okay.

1938
01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.374
There are elements of it that feels

1939
01:12:29.374 --> 01:12:31.960
like blood,

1940
01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:36.290
but not, or it's a different kind of blood.

1941
01:12:36.290 --> 01:12:37.123
It's strange.

1942
01:12:37.123 --> 01:12:38.654
It's bunched in sections where it looks like

1943
01:12:38.654 --> 01:12:41.400
it may have been more solid and congealed at times.

1944
01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:43.922
The way it's dried out and become this

1945
01:12:43.922 --> 01:12:45.240
caked mud. In some places, it's a layer.

1946
01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:47.077
In some places, it's a bundle.

1947
01:12:47.077 --> 01:12:49.054
Which, blood doesn't bundle.

1948
01:12:49.054 --> 01:12:50.578
TALIESIN: No, but--
TRAVIS: It coagulates.

1949
01:12:50.578 --> 01:12:52.859
TALIESIN: I definitely know enough about, yeah, okay.

1950
01:12:52.859 --> 01:12:56.003
MATT: Something has caused whatever the substance is,

1951
01:12:56.003 --> 01:12:57.376
if it were blood, and there are elements

1952
01:12:57.376 --> 01:13:00.206
that remind you of it, to coagulate heavily.

1953
01:13:00.206 --> 01:13:02.054
All these things that you see,

1954
01:13:02.054 --> 01:13:03.219
there's no sign of bones,

1955
01:13:03.219 --> 01:13:05.404
there's no signs of flesh or decay.

1956
01:13:05.404 --> 01:13:07.575
There's just this material.
TALIESIN: No, they've dissolved.

1957
01:13:07.575 --> 01:13:11.293
LAURA: It is like their poop!
TALIESIN: No, it's not.

1958
01:13:11.293 --> 01:13:13.296
It's the opposite.
LAURA: I mean, yeah.

1959
01:13:13.296 --> 01:13:16.359
TALIESIN: These are--
LAURA: Poop from the mouth.

1960
01:13:16.359 --> 01:13:18.866
(laughter)

1961
01:13:18.866 --> 01:13:20.792
LIAM: Regurgitated?
TRAVIS: Poop from the mouth.

1962
01:13:20.792 --> 01:13:23.168
TALIESIN: This is meals put away for later.

1963
01:13:23.168 --> 01:13:25.398
LIAM: I have a question, too, but I think you did first.

1964
01:13:25.398 --> 01:13:27.303
MARISHA: Yeah, sorry.

1965
01:13:27.303 --> 01:13:30.640
Am I able to tell where these spiders might have come from

1966
01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:33.888
or what kind of spiders they might be?

1967
01:13:33.888 --> 01:13:35.984
Are these abyssal spiders?

1968
01:13:35.984 --> 01:13:38.684
MATT: Make a religion check.
TRAVIS: Ooh.

1969
01:13:38.684 --> 01:13:40.669
TALIESIN: That was an interesting thought.

1970
01:13:40.669 --> 01:13:42.500
SAM: Abyssal spiders?
TRAVIS: Is that a thing?

1971
01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:44.083
MARISHA: Abyssal.

1972
01:13:46.462 --> 01:13:47.295
11.

1973
01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:53.119
MATT: (sighs) You're hard pressed to think of anything

1974
01:13:53.119 --> 01:13:55.719
specific. They don't look like normal spiders.

1975
01:13:59.049 --> 01:14:03.132
They're in the entranceway of some dark fortress.

1976
01:14:06.038 --> 01:14:09.288
The rest is not coming to mind.

1977
01:14:10.322 --> 01:14:11.155
TRAVIS: That is a clear door on

1978
01:14:11.155 --> 01:14:12.596
the other side of the room, right?

1979
01:14:12.596 --> 01:14:14.188
MATT: There is the latticed gate, yes.

1980
01:14:14.188 --> 01:14:15.615
TALIESIN: We just have to--

1981
01:14:15.615 --> 01:14:18.290
someone with something sharp or something

1982
01:14:18.290 --> 01:14:20.570
has to cut these webs down.

1983
01:14:20.570 --> 01:14:22.982
LIAM: My question was if my intelligence and everything

1984
01:14:22.982 --> 01:14:25.594
adjusts to this spider, to the form I'm in,

1985
01:14:25.594 --> 01:14:27.935
do I also have any sort of animal instinct

1986
01:14:27.935 --> 01:14:32.734
that I'm looking at either an egg sac or a food sac?

1987
01:14:32.734 --> 01:14:34.963
MATT: I'd say, as this is happening,

1988
01:14:34.963 --> 01:14:38.006
this is definitely an egg sac.

1989
01:14:38.006 --> 01:14:41.089
It's like 15 feet long, side to side.

1990
01:14:41.923 --> 01:14:44.173
TRAVIS: Fire, with fire!

1991
01:14:45.362 --> 01:14:47.702
SAM: I'm going to start cutting through the room,

1992
01:14:47.702 --> 01:14:49.859
try to get to the other side.
MATT: Okay.

1993
01:14:49.859 --> 01:14:50.711
Now that you guys have noticed

1994
01:14:50.711 --> 01:14:52.931
and you have all the light in the center,

1995
01:14:52.931 --> 01:14:54.803
you come through and start clearing it out bit by bit.

1996
01:14:54.803 --> 01:14:55.636
TALIESIN: While they're doing that,

1997
01:14:55.636 --> 01:14:56.469
I'm going to keep looking around,

1998
01:14:56.469 --> 01:14:57.336
taking a look at things,

1999
01:14:57.336 --> 01:14:58.231
seeing if anything seems odd.
LAURA: I'm going to use

2000
01:14:58.231 --> 01:15:01.560
Sacred Flame on the webs, as much as possible.

2001
01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:03.685
MATT: Slowly burning away the remnants

2002
01:15:03.685 --> 01:15:05.501
of the webbed interior--

2003
01:15:05.501 --> 01:15:07.666
Oh god!
(shouting)

2004
01:15:07.666 --> 01:15:09.749
TRAVIS: My foot, fuck!

2005
01:15:11.223 --> 01:15:15.470
LIAM: Caleb will back-- Widogast Widow will back up to the

2006
01:15:15.470 --> 01:15:19.033
edge of that little cave that I was at

2007
01:15:19.033 --> 01:15:23.352
and revert to a human and say to the group that

2008
01:15:23.352 --> 01:15:26.835
there is a very large egg sac in there.

2009
01:15:26.835 --> 01:15:28.873
Do we want to just try to walk away from it

2010
01:15:28.873 --> 01:15:30.507
or should I burn it?

2011
01:15:30.507 --> 01:15:32.824
SAM: We should burn it because if we ever come back

2012
01:15:32.824 --> 01:15:34.811
through here, there could be some more spideys.

2013
01:15:34.811 --> 01:15:35.644
LAURA: Yeah.

2014
01:15:35.644 --> 01:15:36.527
TRAVIS: Exactly what I was going to say.

2015
01:15:36.527 --> 01:15:38.006
LAURA: Also, we should look through some of those other

2016
01:15:38.006 --> 01:15:39.383
egg sac things and see

2017
01:15:39.383 --> 01:15:41.462
because we got this key out of that one, right?

2018
01:15:41.462 --> 01:15:44.834
So what if there's cool stuff in some of the other ones?

2019
01:15:44.834 --> 01:15:46.626
TALIESIN: I was going to argue against that,

2020
01:15:46.626 --> 01:15:48.293
but considering that

2021
01:15:49.827 --> 01:15:51.393
the eggs are probably not going to be--

2022
01:15:51.393 --> 01:15:53.492
TRAVIS: Should we see if the lattice needs to be unlocked

2023
01:15:53.492 --> 01:15:54.994
by said key and get the door open?

2024
01:15:54.994 --> 01:15:57.797
TALIESIN: Let's check.
LIAM: Yeah, that is good.

2025
01:15:57.797 --> 01:16:00.208
Then everybody either go

2026
01:16:00.208 --> 01:16:01.884
just through the entrance over there

2027
01:16:01.884 --> 01:16:04.691
or to the other side and I will stand way back and just

2028
01:16:04.691 --> 01:16:07.591
hock, hock that sphere of fire in there.

2029
01:16:07.591 --> 01:16:09.405
TALIESIN: We want to also make sure that there aren't any

2030
01:16:09.405 --> 01:16:12.210
other traps in the room or anything like that.

2031
01:16:12.210 --> 01:16:14.143
SAM: In this room?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2032
01:16:14.143 --> 01:16:15.136
SAM: Okay.

2033
01:16:15.136 --> 01:16:17.286
TALIESIN: Just to make sure none of the--

2034
01:16:17.286 --> 01:16:18.366
SAM: Like, near the door?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2035
01:16:18.366 --> 01:16:19.533
TRAVIS: Go check that gate, Nott.

2036
01:16:19.533 --> 01:16:20.621
SAM: I'll check that gate.

2037
01:16:20.621 --> 01:16:21.454
I'll check that gate.

2038
01:16:21.454 --> 01:16:22.615
I'm going to go check that gate.

2039
01:16:22.615 --> 01:16:24.975
MATT: Nott, make an investigation check for me.

2040
01:16:24.975 --> 01:16:27.796
LAURA: (laughs) What was that throw?

2041
01:16:27.796 --> 01:16:31.417
SAM: That's my new roll.
LAURA: His roll went--

2042
01:16:31.417 --> 01:16:33.192
MATT: Hey, dice!

2043
01:16:33.192 --> 01:16:34.025
SAM: 23.
MATT: 23.

2044
01:16:35.189 --> 01:16:37.270
That doesn't appear to be trapped.

2045
01:16:37.270 --> 01:16:38.578
SAM: No traps here that I can see,

2046
01:16:38.578 --> 01:16:39.894
but I've been wrong before.

2047
01:16:39.894 --> 01:16:41.673
MATT: Looking around it, you do see

2048
01:16:41.673 --> 01:16:44.528
the center of the grates, they overlap

2049
01:16:44.528 --> 01:16:45.951
and are latched in.

2050
01:16:45.951 --> 01:16:49.426
There is a central bar that ties them together

2051
01:16:49.426 --> 01:16:50.503
in the center part where they are

2052
01:16:50.503 --> 01:16:52.613
and there is a keyhole there.

2053
01:16:52.613 --> 01:16:54.415
SAM: Oh, maybe that key will work.

2054
01:16:54.415 --> 01:16:56.327
Come on over, Jessie.

2055
01:16:56.327 --> 01:16:57.463
TALIESIN: I'm going to check the--
LAURA: Should I do it?

2056
01:16:57.463 --> 01:16:59.526
SAM: Yeah, do it. Yeah, it's fine.

2057
01:16:59.526 --> 01:17:02.433
TALIESIN: Did you check the door?
SAM: I checked everywhere.

2058
01:17:02.433 --> 01:17:03.857
TALIESIN: Okay.
SAM: Maybe.

2059
01:17:03.857 --> 01:17:05.363
TALIESIN: I'm looking at the columns while that happens.

2060
01:17:05.363 --> 01:17:07.186
ASHLEY: Yeah, I want to--
MATT: Okay.

2061
01:17:07.186 --> 01:17:08.710
You guys are looking at the column.

2062
01:17:08.710 --> 01:17:10.439
As you approach and meet up with Nott,

2063
01:17:10.439 --> 01:17:13.043
you look down and you can see there's--

2064
01:17:13.043 --> 01:17:15.600
with what light's coming to the edge of the chamber

2065
01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:18.862
on the opposite end, a bit of mist is

2066
01:17:18.862 --> 01:17:21.245
gently making its way into the room

2067
01:17:21.245 --> 01:17:22.876
through the lattice in the floor.

2068
01:17:22.876 --> 01:17:25.894
There's maybe an inch of mist that's (blowing)

2069
01:17:25.894 --> 01:17:28.153
entering before it dissipates.

2070
01:17:28.153 --> 01:17:30.905
The room itself is warmer than

2071
01:17:30.905 --> 01:17:34.083
the place you entered through.

2072
01:17:34.083 --> 01:17:34.921
But you put the key in.
LAURA: In this room?

2073
01:17:34.921 --> 01:17:35.987
MATT: In this room, yeah.

2074
01:17:35.987 --> 01:17:37.762
LAURA: You guys, there's stuff on

2075
01:17:37.762 --> 01:17:40.392
the other side of this door.

2076
01:17:40.392 --> 01:17:42.237
MATT: You notice, Yasha, too, the corpses of the spiders,

2077
01:17:42.237 --> 01:17:44.388
as you pick them up, they're hot to the touch.

2078
01:17:44.388 --> 01:17:47.064
Not scalding, but there's a heat to them.

2079
01:17:47.064 --> 01:17:50.077
SAM: Yasha, do you know what this is? Where are we?

2080
01:17:50.077 --> 01:17:52.415
ASHLEY: I have a feeling we should not eat these,

2081
01:17:52.415 --> 01:17:54.830
so I'm going to put these aside.

2082
01:17:54.830 --> 01:17:57.826
Just intuition.
TALIESIN: All right.

2083
01:17:57.826 --> 01:17:59.956
MATT: So you put the key in

2084
01:17:59.956 --> 01:18:01.919
and then you turn it.

2085
01:18:01.919 --> 01:18:03.930
LAURA: Well, I'm holding off for just a minute

2086
01:18:03.930 --> 01:18:06.662
because there's mist coming through here.

2087
01:18:06.662 --> 01:18:08.563
TRAVIS: Yeah, and it's just like--
LAURA: Maybe Detect Magic?

2088
01:18:08.563 --> 01:18:11.259
TALIESIN: I'm out. I've only got one of them.

2089
01:18:11.259 --> 01:18:14.989
ASHLEY: Yeah, can we just give a looksee of the pillars?

2090
01:18:14.989 --> 01:18:18.601
MATT: Yeah, perception check, both of you guys.

2091
01:18:18.601 --> 01:18:19.434
TALIESIN: 20.

2092
01:18:22.249 --> 01:18:23.798
ASHLEY: I've run into it.

2093
01:18:23.798 --> 01:18:24.881
I rolled one.

2094
01:18:26.857 --> 01:18:28.153
MATT: While Yasha's rubbing the nose,

2095
01:18:28.153 --> 01:18:31.524
it's a little bit flattened by the impact,

2096
01:18:31.524 --> 01:18:32.523
you glance around.

2097
01:18:32.523 --> 01:18:33.926
TRAVIS: At least you can keep raging.

2098
01:18:33.926 --> 01:18:34.759
ASHLEY: I'm okay.

2099
01:18:34.759 --> 01:18:37.034
MATT: These pillars, nothing particular about them

2100
01:18:37.034 --> 01:18:39.222
strikes you. They're mainly just load bearing

2101
01:18:39.222 --> 01:18:42.757
and meant to design a symmetrical entrance to this.

2102
01:18:42.757 --> 01:18:43.851
TALIESIN: No writing, no everything.

2103
01:18:43.851 --> 01:18:45.392
TRAVIS: All right, everybody through the door--

2104
01:18:45.392 --> 01:18:48.811
LAURA: Hold on, hold on, does the mist seem like

2105
01:18:48.811 --> 01:18:51.361
normal mist or does it seem like creepy mist

2106
01:18:51.361 --> 01:18:54.613
or like it could be poisonous?
MATT: It looks like mist.

2107
01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:58.280
Make a perception check.

2108
01:18:59.167 --> 01:19:02.209
You know what, nature check, nature check.

2109
01:19:02.209 --> 01:19:03.206
You can see the mist.

2110
01:19:03.206 --> 01:19:04.478
LAURA: Nature.
MATT: Yes.

2111
01:19:04.478 --> 01:19:06.119
LAURA: Eight.
MATT: Eight.

2112
01:19:06.119 --> 01:19:07.734
Looks like mist.

2113
01:19:07.734 --> 01:19:09.000
LAURA: I think it's just mist.

2114
01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.358
TRAVIS: All right, everybody in.

2115
01:19:10.358 --> 01:19:11.305
Let's light this candle.
LAURA: Hold on,

2116
01:19:11.305 --> 01:19:13.264
I haven't unlocked it yet.

2117
01:19:13.264 --> 01:19:14.097
MATT: You turn it.

2118
01:19:14.097 --> 01:19:14.930
TALIESIN: I'm sticking back with Caleb.

2119
01:19:14.930 --> 01:19:18.575
MATT: The metal swings (creaks).

2120
01:19:18.575 --> 01:19:19.978
You push it off to the side

2121
01:19:19.978 --> 01:19:21.602
and the lattice can be pulled apart,

2122
01:19:21.602 --> 01:19:24.680
pulls open to one side or both

2123
01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:26.517
and slides inside the doorway,

2124
01:19:26.517 --> 01:19:29.494
opening the entrance way, and as you all approach,

2125
01:19:29.494 --> 01:19:33.323
you can see, the light source is still cast

2126
01:19:33.323 --> 01:19:35.233
in the center of the chamber. You can move it if you want

2127
01:19:35.233 --> 01:19:39.185
or cast it again, but you can see this mist

2128
01:19:39.185 --> 01:19:42.452
just coasting across the floor,

2129
01:19:42.452 --> 01:19:44.879
making its way towards the chamber you were just in.

2130
01:19:44.879 --> 01:19:46.309
TRAVIS: Does it look like a hallway or is there

2131
01:19:46.309 --> 01:19:48.213
a back that we can see?

2132
01:19:48.213 --> 01:19:52.040
MATT: Currently, you see a hallway that goes back about

2133
01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:53.313
to the edge of your visual range.

2134
01:19:53.313 --> 01:19:54.507
What's your darkvision?
TRAVIS: 60 feet.

2135
01:19:54.507 --> 01:19:57.077
MATT: 60 feet, okay. So yeah, you can see the back.

2136
01:19:57.077 --> 01:19:59.278
You can see the hallway continues on

2137
01:19:59.278 --> 01:20:00.499
and just, there's a wall.

2138
01:20:00.499 --> 01:20:02.230
TRAVIS: Just a dead end? Doesn't look like a T?

2139
01:20:02.230 --> 01:20:04.079
MATT: Correct, well, from what you can see here.

2140
01:20:04.079 --> 01:20:07.221
The mist seems to be higher and thicker

2141
01:20:07.221 --> 01:20:09.310
the further in you go.

2142
01:20:09.310 --> 01:20:11.977
TRAVIS: It's coming down, then, from--

2143
01:20:13.593 --> 01:20:14.900
SAM: Above?

2144
01:20:14.900 --> 01:20:15.813
TRAVIS: Unless there's a grate

2145
01:20:15.813 --> 01:20:17.397
that's up off the floor or something.

2146
01:20:17.397 --> 01:20:18.477
MARISHA: Does it look like it's

2147
01:20:18.477 --> 01:20:21.589
continuing to roll out into this room?

2148
01:20:21.589 --> 01:20:23.867
Or is it just dissipating in a certain point?

2149
01:20:23.867 --> 01:20:26.047
MATT: It's dissipating as it enters the room.

2150
01:20:26.047 --> 01:20:27.630
TRAVIS: It's coming down.

2151
01:20:28.516 --> 01:20:29.864
All right, all right, everybody,

2152
01:20:29.864 --> 01:20:32.345
now that we're by the door, Caleb, do your--

2153
01:20:32.345 --> 01:20:33.929
LIAM: You either go in a couple of--

2154
01:20:33.929 --> 01:20:36.200
well, you know what, nevermind, I have a different idea.

2155
01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:40.025
I cast Dancing Lights and the four globules

2156
01:20:40.025 --> 01:20:42.174
go into a little row, illuminating the crack

2157
01:20:42.174 --> 01:20:45.022
from this room into that back chamber

2158
01:20:45.022 --> 01:20:47.322
and I make sure that the Glove of Blasting is on tight

2159
01:20:47.322 --> 01:20:52.322
and I throw out three Scorching Rays at the egg sac.

2160
01:20:52.521 --> 01:20:54.724
MATT: Okay, roll three attacks.

2161
01:20:54.724 --> 01:20:56.106
LIAM: First is super low.

2162
01:20:56.106 --> 01:20:59.835
It is, hold, hold, hold.

2163
01:20:59.835 --> 01:21:01.217
SAM: Holding.

2164
01:21:01.217 --> 01:21:02.467
LIAM: Hold, it is 13.

2165
01:21:03.942 --> 01:21:05.921
MATT: 13 is fine. Roll again.

2166
01:21:05.921 --> 01:21:08.165
LIAM: The second is higher than that.

2167
01:21:08.165 --> 01:21:08.998
16.

2168
01:21:10.350 --> 01:21:13.384
Oh, lower. The last one is 11.

2169
01:21:13.384 --> 01:21:15.691
MATT: 11, okay, so roll damage for the first two.

2170
01:21:15.691 --> 01:21:16.774
LIAM: Okay, okay.

2171
01:21:20.168 --> 01:21:24.031
I don't have this prepared. It's an item, so.

2172
01:21:24.031 --> 01:21:25.113
MATT: I believe it's two d6 fire damage for--

2173
01:21:25.113 --> 01:21:26.872
LIAM: Yeah, I do, too. I just wanted to make sure.

2174
01:21:26.872 --> 01:21:28.289
So the first two.

2175
01:21:29.570 --> 01:21:31.977
LAURA: What if he was letting us know because the room is so

2176
01:21:31.977 --> 01:21:34.362
hot. What if it's something fire resistant?
LIAM: 12.

2177
01:21:34.362 --> 01:21:36.849
MATT: Okay, so (poofs).

2178
01:21:36.849 --> 01:21:41.849
Both the bolts strike through the center and left side.

2179
01:21:41.895 --> 01:21:44.637
It goes up in flames and begins to burn.

2180
01:21:44.637 --> 01:21:48.900
The right side hits, impacts, but doesn't seem to catch.

2181
01:21:48.900 --> 01:21:50.485
LIAM: Back up, back up, back up, back up.

2182
01:21:50.485 --> 01:21:53.972
MATT: As the flames begin to curl up, you hear

2183
01:21:53.972 --> 01:21:57.978
(screeching) this loud,

2184
01:21:57.978 --> 01:22:01.978
discordant gathering of tiny squeaks and squeals

2185
01:22:02.922 --> 01:22:05.162
and you watch as some tiny spiders,

2186
01:22:05.162 --> 01:22:08.619
when I say tiny, I mean, you know, six inches across,

2187
01:22:08.619 --> 01:22:10.273
come out and fall and burn.

2188
01:22:10.273 --> 01:22:11.994
Some come out on fire and continue

2189
01:22:11.994 --> 01:22:14.766
to skitter in your direction. Some come out untouched.

2190
01:22:14.766 --> 01:22:16.445
There is hundreds.

2191
01:22:16.445 --> 01:22:18.006
TRAVIS: Nuke that fucking thing!

2192
01:22:18.006 --> 01:22:20.381
LIAM: I start pulling out bat guano and sulfur

2193
01:22:20.381 --> 01:22:24.698
and if I have the time, Old English.

2194
01:22:24.698 --> 01:22:26.058
TRAVIS: Yeah!

2195
01:22:26.058 --> 01:22:28.409
MATT: They're scattering out in all directions.

2196
01:22:28.409 --> 01:22:30.832
They're escaping the flames.

2197
01:22:30.832 --> 01:22:32.875
They seem to be--
LIAM: I will put in front of them.

2198
01:22:32.875 --> 01:22:33.708
MATT: Yes.

2199
01:22:34.672 --> 01:22:35.873
You guys watch as Caleb throws the one,

2200
01:22:35.873 --> 01:22:38.153
backs up, backs up.

2201
01:22:38.153 --> 01:22:40.697
Throws the second sphere and (explosion)

2202
01:22:40.697 --> 01:22:42.735
the fire almost back drafts for about 10 feet

2203
01:22:42.735 --> 01:22:44.076
out of the interior chamber.

2204
01:22:44.076 --> 01:22:45.678
The heat catches you.

2205
01:22:45.678 --> 01:22:47.907
The room's already warm, but now this is a flash heat

2206
01:22:47.907 --> 01:22:50.881
that singes you by proximity.

2207
01:22:50.881 --> 01:22:53.034
You watch as dozens and dozens

2208
01:22:53.034 --> 01:22:53.993
of flaming spider corpses

2209
01:22:53.993 --> 01:22:56.334
are jettisoned out of the explosion in pieces

2210
01:22:56.334 --> 01:22:58.337
and, for a moment, you watch as the entire chamber

2211
01:22:58.337 --> 01:23:03.170
is rained with tiny bits of cinder across the ground.

2212
01:23:05.351 --> 01:23:07.655
But--
SAM: Food fight!

2213
01:23:07.655 --> 01:23:11.652
MATT: They seem to be fairly resistant to flame, but not

2214
01:23:11.652 --> 01:23:13.031
immune and that was enough to finish off

2215
01:23:13.031 --> 01:23:14.963
the entirety of that chamber.

2216
01:23:14.963 --> 01:23:17.084
LIAM: Tugging on the glove.

2217
01:23:17.084 --> 01:23:19.744
Should have done that in the first place. Let's go.

2218
01:23:19.744 --> 01:23:21.520
TALIESIN: Let's take a quick, I'm going to take a quick--

2219
01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:22.924
TRAVIS: Quick look.
TALIESIN: --peek in there.

2220
01:23:22.924 --> 01:23:24.396
I'm going to hop up with my Light

2221
01:23:24.396 --> 01:23:25.648
and take a quick look.
MATT: Okay.

2222
01:23:25.648 --> 01:23:29.150
It is a blackened small rock alcove

2223
01:23:29.150 --> 01:23:33.197
where there is current still burning bits of web,

2224
01:23:33.197 --> 01:23:37.344
egg sac, and dozens of exploded bits of spider.

2225
01:23:37.344 --> 01:23:38.177
TALIESIN: Nothing else.

2226
01:23:38.177 --> 01:23:39.273
Nothing else in there?

2227
01:23:39.273 --> 01:23:40.339
MATT: Make an investigation check

2228
01:23:40.339 --> 01:23:41.530
if you want to scan through.

2229
01:23:41.530 --> 01:23:42.904
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2230
01:23:42.904 --> 01:23:45.821
My investigation sucks, but fuck it.

2231
01:23:47.461 --> 01:23:48.681
11.

2232
01:23:48.681 --> 01:23:49.979
MATT: 11.

2233
01:23:49.979 --> 01:23:51.448
You pour through.

2234
01:23:51.448 --> 01:23:55.915
You find a lot of burnt spider bits.

2235
01:23:58.198 --> 01:24:01.594
Nothing else really catches your attention, unfortunately.

2236
01:24:01.594 --> 01:24:02.758
LIAM: You know, I was going to leave,

2237
01:24:02.758 --> 01:24:04.919
but if I see Caduceus picking around in it.

2238
01:24:04.919 --> 01:24:07.739
I will go and what are you looking for?

2239
01:24:07.739 --> 01:24:08.989
TALIESIN: I don't know.

2240
01:24:10.289 --> 01:24:12.058
Yeah, nests are nests, you never know

2241
01:24:12.058 --> 01:24:14.899
if something interesting gets stashed.

2242
01:24:14.899 --> 01:24:17.250
LIAM: Okay, can I Will Graham the room?

2243
01:24:17.250 --> 01:24:18.779
TRAVIS: Will Graham! (clapping)

2244
01:24:18.779 --> 01:24:21.278
TALIESIN: I love you so much.
ASHLEY: What a good reference.

2245
01:24:21.278 --> 01:24:22.111
MATT: Sure.

2246
01:24:22.111 --> 01:24:25.618
TALIESIN: I needed that so badly.
ASHLEY: Thank you.

2247
01:24:25.618 --> 01:24:28.438
LIAM: So that is...

2248
01:24:28.438 --> 01:24:30.058
23.

2249
01:24:30.058 --> 01:24:31.058
MATT: 23?
LIAM: Yeah.

2250
01:24:32.086 --> 01:24:34.594
MATT: To?
LIAM: To look and see

2251
01:24:34.594 --> 01:24:39.094
if I see anything in the cavity where the egg sac was.

2252
01:24:39.991 --> 01:24:41.132
MATT: Right, okay.

2253
01:24:41.132 --> 01:24:43.033
Yeah, as you kind of,

2254
01:24:43.033 --> 01:24:44.383
and this'll take you a while to do so

2255
01:24:44.383 --> 01:24:45.410
because you guys are pouring through

2256
01:24:45.410 --> 01:24:46.500
a bunch of burning rubble having to wait for it

2257
01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:48.482
to cool off in some areas and

2258
01:24:48.482 --> 01:24:51.025
take weapons you have and shove off

2259
01:24:51.025 --> 01:24:53.995
sections of burning, charcoaled husks

2260
01:24:53.995 --> 01:24:56.030
that were a part of the egg sac

2261
01:24:56.030 --> 01:24:59.149
and broken, destroyed spider baby corpses

2262
01:24:59.149 --> 01:25:01.632
just falling onto the ground into ash.

2263
01:25:01.632 --> 01:25:06.613
LIAM: I will also look for any whole, cooked spider babies.

2264
01:25:06.613 --> 01:25:07.778
MATT: There's probably a few if you want to.

2265
01:25:07.778 --> 01:25:09.000
You can probably grab a few.
LIAM: I'll pick up two or

2266
01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.294
three while I'm searching.
MATT: Easy enough to grab.

2267
01:25:11.294 --> 01:25:12.961
Easy enough to grab.

2268
01:25:16.858 --> 01:25:20.889
You do find a jeweled case,

2269
01:25:20.889 --> 01:25:24.158
about that big, that is wrapped in leather

2270
01:25:24.158 --> 01:25:28.207
and part of one of the handfuls of other

2271
01:25:28.207 --> 01:25:32.535
webbed pouches similar to the other deflated,

2272
01:25:32.535 --> 01:25:35.877
mud-caked interior-ed web pouches

2273
01:25:35.877 --> 01:25:37.184
you saw in the main chamber.

2274
01:25:37.184 --> 01:25:38.359
LIAM: I'm going to call over my shoulder to the group.

2275
01:25:38.359 --> 01:25:39.859
Are we in a hurry?

2276
01:25:40.975 --> 01:25:42.131
Do I have 10?

2277
01:25:42.131 --> 01:25:45.439
SAM: Sure, take your time.
TRAVIS: Yeah, do it.

2278
01:25:45.439 --> 01:25:50.189
LIAM: I uh, I uh (dithering)

2279
01:25:50.189 --> 01:25:51.766
I pick it up.

2280
01:25:51.766 --> 01:25:53.305
MATT: Okay, you grab it.

2281
01:25:53.305 --> 01:25:55.839
LIAM: Nott, come here!
SAM: What?

2282
01:25:55.839 --> 01:25:57.293
Up in there, okay.
LIAM: Oh, no, I start

2283
01:25:57.293 --> 01:25:58.963
carrying it out.
TRAVIS: --guard this hallway

2284
01:25:58.963 --> 01:26:00.347
just in case something comes out.

2285
01:26:00.347 --> 01:26:01.816
LAURA: You got it. I'm already sitting there.

2286
01:26:01.816 --> 01:26:04.094
I'm making swirly patterns in the mist.

2287
01:26:04.094 --> 01:26:07.305
LIAM: Is that going to explode or spit out gas or anything?

2288
01:26:07.305 --> 01:26:08.228
SAM: I don't know.

2289
01:26:08.228 --> 01:26:09.641
Maybe. Let me check it.

2290
01:26:09.641 --> 01:26:11.034
I will check it for traps.

2291
01:26:11.034 --> 01:26:12.032
MATT: Go for it.

2292
01:26:12.032 --> 01:26:13.376
TALIESIN: How is everybody?
SAM: 27.

2293
01:26:13.376 --> 01:26:16.379
MATT: 27. Seems safe enough, though it is locked.

2294
01:26:16.379 --> 01:26:18.365
TALIESIN: I'm just going to do--
SAM: I'll try to unlock it.

2295
01:26:18.365 --> 01:26:20.798
TALIESIN: Since we're taking 10, quick Prayer of Healing.

2296
01:26:20.798 --> 01:26:22.527
MARISHA: Okay.
SAM: 32.

2297
01:26:22.527 --> 01:26:23.360
MATT: 32.

2298
01:26:24.422 --> 01:26:25.759
MARISHA: Can you spell your name?

2299
01:26:25.759 --> 01:26:28.259
MATT: You look at it. The lock is--

2300
01:26:29.659 --> 01:26:31.012
the actual design of it, as you get a chance

2301
01:26:31.012 --> 01:26:33.136
to then get the dust off of it,

2302
01:26:33.136 --> 01:26:35.862
it's like a dark, black wood,

2303
01:26:35.862 --> 01:26:37.950
though it did not burn, with a little bit of

2304
01:26:37.950 --> 01:26:40.040
a metallic, iron trim on all sides

2305
01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:44.657
and the lock itself is a unique key-shape

2306
01:26:44.657 --> 01:26:45.692
that you've not seen before.

2307
01:26:45.692 --> 01:26:48.775
It looks weirdly like a fucked up Z.

2308
01:26:48.775 --> 01:26:49.878
It's interesting.

2309
01:26:49.878 --> 01:26:51.805
You go ahead and find the lock and unpick it.

2310
01:26:51.805 --> 01:26:53.294
Open it up.

2311
01:26:53.294 --> 01:26:55.697
There is a piece of leather wrapped around

2312
01:26:55.697 --> 01:26:58.876
a piece of veelium

2313
01:26:58.876 --> 01:27:00.187
that is tightly wrapped.

2314
01:27:00.187 --> 01:27:01.975
SAM: Feelium?
MATT: Yes.

2315
01:27:01.975 --> 01:27:03.020
SAM: What's that? What's that?

2316
01:27:03.020 --> 01:27:03.874
Who is that?

2317
01:27:03.874 --> 01:27:05.779
Oh, it's a spell.

2318
01:27:05.779 --> 01:27:07.096
It's a spell.
MATT: It appears to be a

2319
01:27:07.096 --> 01:27:09.569
scroll of some kind.
SAM: I give it to you.

2320
01:27:09.569 --> 01:27:10.402
Take this.

2321
01:27:10.402 --> 01:27:13.272
It's like a book, but smaller and rolled up.

2322
01:27:13.272 --> 01:27:16.058
LIAM: This is for reading later and I tuck it away.

2323
01:27:16.058 --> 01:27:17.924
MATT: (laughs) All right.

2324
01:27:17.924 --> 01:27:19.026
SAM: Are we doing that thing where we--

2325
01:27:19.026 --> 01:27:19.870
LAURA: Shouldn't you read it now?

2326
01:27:19.870 --> 01:27:21.517
because we need it.
SAM: --we take scrolls

2327
01:27:21.517 --> 01:27:23.310
and we don't tell the rest of the group about them?

2328
01:27:23.310 --> 01:27:25.747
TALIESIN: I've already burned a 10-minute, no matter what.

2329
01:27:25.747 --> 01:27:27.330
LIAM: Okay, okay, okay.

2330
01:27:28.431 --> 01:27:32.297
With the scroll, do I need to Identify or read it?

2331
01:27:32.297 --> 01:27:33.586
MATT: I mean, it'll take you a little bit to--

2332
01:27:33.586 --> 01:27:35.206
not too long, but you can scan through it

2333
01:27:35.206 --> 01:27:37.147
and take time to study it.
LIAM: I'll take time

2334
01:27:37.147 --> 01:27:38.549
to study it then.
MATT: Okay.

2335
01:27:38.549 --> 01:27:39.699
What's everyone else doing while this is happening?

2336
01:27:39.699 --> 01:27:41.179
TALIESIN: I'm doing a 10-minute heal.

2337
01:27:41.179 --> 01:27:42.012
MATT: 10-minute heal.

2338
01:27:42.012 --> 01:27:43.283
You'll go ahead and mark that off

2339
01:27:43.283 --> 01:27:44.888
and go ahead and roll healing for everybody.

2340
01:27:44.888 --> 01:27:46.583
TALIESIN: Got it.
TRAVIS: Got it.

2341
01:27:46.583 --> 01:27:47.921
14 points.
TALIESIN: You took it, you took it,

2342
01:27:47.921 --> 01:27:50.039
and you need it?
MATT: All righty.

2343
01:27:50.039 --> 01:27:50.872
LAURA: Have we already looked through

2344
01:27:50.872 --> 01:27:53.279
all of the other little dangled bits?

2345
01:27:53.279 --> 01:27:55.245
MATT: You guys have gone through the

2346
01:27:55.245 --> 01:27:56.303
remainder of the chamber.

2347
01:27:56.303 --> 01:27:57.479
TRAVIS: Is that little dagger just a dagger?

2348
01:27:57.479 --> 01:27:58.643
MATT: It's a standard dagger.
TRAVIS: Okay.

2349
01:27:58.643 --> 01:28:00.611
SAM: I'm going to go over to Yasha and say:

2350
01:28:00.611 --> 01:28:02.561
is any of this ringing a bell yet?

2351
01:28:02.561 --> 01:28:03.852
Have you been here before?

2352
01:28:03.852 --> 01:28:06.691
Do you remember hot mist?
ASHLEY: No, I don't.

2353
01:28:06.691 --> 01:28:08.935
I don't think I've ever been here.

2354
01:28:08.935 --> 01:28:10.249
TALIESIN: We all remember hot mist.

2355
01:28:10.249 --> 01:28:11.312
ASHLEY: Yeah, I don't think I've ever been here.

2356
01:28:11.312 --> 01:28:14.304
SAM: You're not holding back from us or anything?

2357
01:28:14.304 --> 01:28:15.137
ASHLEY: No.

2358
01:28:15.137 --> 01:28:16.205
SAM: Insight check.

2359
01:28:16.205 --> 01:28:17.205
MATT: Go for it.

2360
01:28:18.069 --> 01:28:18.902
SAM: 10.

2361
01:28:20.489 --> 01:28:22.293
MATT: She seems pretty on the level.

2362
01:28:23.510 --> 01:28:24.343
SAM: Hey.

2363
01:28:26.276 --> 01:28:28.792
Did you steal my flask?

2364
01:28:28.792 --> 01:28:30.490
ASHLEY: Oh, that's right, your flask.

2365
01:28:30.490 --> 01:28:33.044
Nott, I did not steal your flask.

2366
01:28:33.044 --> 01:28:34.160
SAM: Okay.

2367
01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:35.065
Do you know who did?

2368
01:28:35.065 --> 01:28:36.638
ASHLEY: Are you sure you don't have it?

2369
01:28:36.638 --> 01:28:37.881
SAM: I'm sure I don't have it.

2370
01:28:37.881 --> 01:28:41.613
I've looked in all my pockets twice and in my shoes.

2371
01:28:41.613 --> 01:28:43.702
MARISHA: You know, you did pretty great out there,

2372
01:28:43.702 --> 01:28:45.777
though, without it.
ASHLEY: Yeah, you did.

2373
01:28:45.777 --> 01:28:48.183
TRAVIS: Yeah, that one shot, boom!
MARISHA: It's gnarly.

2374
01:28:48.183 --> 01:28:50.530
LAURA: Oh my gosh, that was really impressive.

2375
01:28:50.530 --> 01:28:53.214
SAM: I was aiming for the other one.

2376
01:28:53.214 --> 01:28:54.845
MARISHA: That was Caleb.

2377
01:28:54.845 --> 01:28:55.933
SAM: I know. I missed.

2378
01:28:55.933 --> 01:28:57.917
I hit the wrong one.

2379
01:28:57.917 --> 01:28:59.667
I'm a mess right now.

2380
01:29:02.664 --> 01:29:04.330
ASHLEY: Yeah, you killed that mama spider

2381
01:29:04.330 --> 01:29:05.938
basically with one hit.

2382
01:29:05.938 --> 01:29:08.523
SAM: I did, I guess, I guess, in a way,

2383
01:29:08.523 --> 01:29:10.477
I'm an orphan-maker, too.

2384
01:29:10.477 --> 01:29:13.786
ASHLEY: I think you are--
(laughter)

2385
01:29:13.786 --> 01:29:15.536
ASHLEY: I think you are more.

2386
01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:18.248
I think you are because did you see

2387
01:29:18.248 --> 01:29:20.115
how many orphans you made?

2388
01:29:20.115 --> 01:29:22.290
And then we killed them all.
SAM: Yeah.

2389
01:29:22.290 --> 01:29:24.739
LAURA: Hundreds.
ASHLEY: Hundreds of them.

2390
01:29:24.739 --> 01:29:27.018
TRAVIS: (laughs)
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2391
01:29:27.018 --> 01:29:29.718
Hey, that nickname is up for grabs

2392
01:29:29.718 --> 01:29:30.929
if you would like to take it.

2393
01:29:30.929 --> 01:29:32.729
SAM: We can maybe share it?

2394
01:29:32.729 --> 01:29:34.653
ASHLEY: You can have it if you want.

2395
01:29:34.653 --> 01:29:36.438
SAM: Well, you know, if we make a band

2396
01:29:36.438 --> 01:29:39.506
with your rock harp, we could be the Orphan Makers.

2397
01:29:39.506 --> 01:29:41.535
ASHLEY: The Orphan Makers?
LAURA: Oh, that's good.

2398
01:29:41.535 --> 01:29:42.533
ASHLEY: Do you play an instrument?

2399
01:29:42.533 --> 01:29:43.366
SAM: I don't.

2400
01:29:45.026 --> 01:29:48.529
I don't, I don't play an instrument, but

2401
01:29:48.529 --> 01:29:49.749
I don't know, maybe I could--
LAURA: You could

2402
01:29:49.749 --> 01:29:52.463
beat the jingle jangle buttons or something.

2403
01:29:52.463 --> 01:29:53.639
SAM: Sure, yeah, yeah.

2404
01:29:53.639 --> 01:29:54.686
Like, what's this thing?
ASHLEY: Like some type

2405
01:29:54.686 --> 01:29:55.519
of percussion?
LAURA: Yeah.

2406
01:29:55.519 --> 01:29:57.862
That belongs in a rock band.
MATT: Shaker?

2407
01:29:57.862 --> 01:29:59.480
LAURA: So it's perfect.

2408
01:29:59.480 --> 01:30:00.936
ASHLEY: How about, if we get out of here,

2409
01:30:00.936 --> 01:30:03.588
let's make a band called the Orphan Makers.

2410
01:30:03.588 --> 01:30:05.642
SAM: Does anyone else play any instruments?

2411
01:30:05.642 --> 01:30:09.085
LAURA: I play piano really well.
SAM: Oh, okay.

2412
01:30:09.085 --> 01:30:10.714
This is a weird band.

2413
01:30:10.714 --> 01:30:12.621
ASHLEY: That's okay. It's going to be great.

2414
01:30:12.621 --> 01:30:14.287
TRAVIS: I can sight read perfectly.

2415
01:30:14.287 --> 01:30:16.370
(laughter)

2416
01:30:16.370 --> 01:30:18.394
SAM: You've studied music theory?

2417
01:30:18.394 --> 01:30:19.317
TRAVIS: No.

2418
01:30:19.317 --> 01:30:20.819
(laughter)

2419
01:30:20.819 --> 01:30:22.210
TALIESIN: By read, I think he means he can read

2420
01:30:22.210 --> 01:30:24.256
when he's looking.
LIAM: Killing babies, by the way,

2421
01:30:24.256 --> 01:30:28.237
technically just makes you a baby killer.

2422
01:30:28.237 --> 01:30:29.715
MATT: But you killed the mama.
MARISHA: Yeah.

2423
01:30:29.715 --> 01:30:32.878
ASHLEY: That name doesn't sound as cool.

2424
01:30:32.878 --> 01:30:34.976
LIAM: I thought that was Keyleth.
LAURA: Aw.

2425
01:30:34.976 --> 01:30:36.990
MATT: You study over the scroll.

2426
01:30:36.990 --> 01:30:39.391
MARISHA: Old campaign, all right, old campaign.

2427
01:30:39.391 --> 01:30:40.924
MATT: The runes immediately come out to you

2428
01:30:40.924 --> 01:30:42.515
as abjuration-based.

2429
01:30:43.843 --> 01:30:47.516
Specifically, this is a Protection from Energy scroll.

2430
01:30:47.516 --> 01:30:48.599
LIAM: Okay, okay.

2431
01:30:49.973 --> 01:30:51.088
MATT: Mark that you have

2432
01:30:51.088 --> 01:30:53.838
a Scroll of Protection of Energy.

2433
01:30:54.817 --> 01:30:56.202
TRAVIS: All right.
TALIESIN: Let's do the stuff.

2434
01:30:56.202 --> 01:30:59.406
TRAVIS: Who's ready to go into the hot yoga studio?

2435
01:30:59.406 --> 01:31:01.609
LAURA: This one's colder.
TRAVIS: What?

2436
01:31:01.609 --> 01:31:02.658
LAURA: That room is colder than this one.

2437
01:31:02.658 --> 01:31:04.652
TRAVIS: I think it's hotter.
TALIESIN: No, it's cold mist.

2438
01:31:04.652 --> 01:31:06.983
It's better for you.
SAM: The mist is cold

2439
01:31:06.983 --> 01:31:08.414
or the mist is hot?
LAURA: The mist is cold.

2440
01:31:08.414 --> 01:31:09.955
That's why it's evaporating.

2441
01:31:09.955 --> 01:31:10.902
MATT: The temperature of the chamber,

2442
01:31:10.902 --> 01:31:12.332
the hallway you're walking towards,

2443
01:31:12.332 --> 01:31:14.489
where the mist is gathered in the far end,

2444
01:31:14.489 --> 01:31:16.493
is noticeably a lower temperature. It is cooler.

2445
01:31:16.493 --> 01:31:17.326
TRAVIS: It's colder.

2446
01:31:17.326 --> 01:31:18.331
LAURA: We learned about these things.

2447
01:31:18.331 --> 01:31:19.748
SAM: That's scarier.

2448
01:31:22.638 --> 01:31:24.019
LAURA: I like the cold. Let's do it.

2449
01:31:24.019 --> 01:31:25.407
TALIESIN: Let's do this.
MATT: All right.

2450
01:31:25.407 --> 01:31:26.948
What's the marching order, guys?

2451
01:31:26.948 --> 01:31:27.781
TRAVIS: I'll be at the front.

2452
01:31:27.781 --> 01:31:28.614
SAM: Yeah, I'm not going in there.

2453
01:31:28.614 --> 01:31:31.087
ASHLEY: I'll be behind Fjord.
LAURA: I'll be behind Yasha.

2454
01:31:31.087 --> 01:31:32.403
MARISHA: I'll be behind Jester.

2455
01:31:32.403 --> 01:31:33.569
TALIESIN: I'll be behind Beau.

2456
01:31:33.569 --> 01:31:36.344
LIAM: I'll be second-to-last.
SAM: I'll be last.

2457
01:31:36.344 --> 01:31:40.663
MATT: Fjord, Yasha, Jester, Beau,

2458
01:31:40.663 --> 01:31:44.546
Caduceus, Nott, Caleb.
TALIESIN: Caleb, Nott.

2459
01:31:44.546 --> 01:31:47.146
LAURA: No, it's like--
SAM: I don't own a pet.

2460
01:31:48.481 --> 01:31:51.844
TALIESIN: Are you sure?
LAURA: It's like a little fuzz.

2461
01:31:53.044 --> 01:31:54.636
MATT: All righty.

2462
01:31:54.636 --> 01:31:55.751
TRAVIS: No problem.

2463
01:31:55.751 --> 01:31:58.115
(muffled chattering)

2464
01:31:58.115 --> 01:31:59.731
SAM: Oh, I did go down on an old guy.

2465
01:31:59.731 --> 01:32:01.256
MATT: It is--
(laughter)

2466
01:32:01.256 --> 01:32:02.089
TALIESIN: Stop it!

2467
01:32:02.089 --> 01:32:04.433
LIAM: Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back!

2468
01:32:04.433 --> 01:32:07.111
MATT: The hallway is about eight, nine feet wide.

2469
01:32:07.111 --> 01:32:09.223
You can do two people at a time if you want to.

2470
01:32:09.223 --> 01:32:10.646
It's up to you.

2471
01:32:10.646 --> 01:32:12.678
TRAVIS: I always love doing two people at a time.

2472
01:32:12.678 --> 01:32:16.180
(laughter)
MARISHA: Sure.

2473
01:32:16.180 --> 01:32:18.511
LAURA: I'll walk next to Beau.

2474
01:32:18.511 --> 01:32:19.586
TRAVIS: Yasha, let's roll.

2475
01:32:19.586 --> 01:32:21.202
ASHLEY: I'll pull up next to Fjord.

2476
01:32:21.202 --> 01:32:22.759
MATT: All right.
TALIESIN: I'll solo.

2477
01:32:22.759 --> 01:32:27.723
ASHLEY: I'll pull up next to--
(laughter)

2478
01:32:27.723 --> 01:32:30.002
MATT: As Yasha and Fjord, the chamber goes on for

2479
01:32:30.002 --> 01:32:33.348
about 60 or so feet before it comes to and end.

2480
01:32:33.348 --> 01:32:34.558
What are you guys doing?
LAURA: Watch for traps and stuff--

2481
01:32:34.558 --> 01:32:37.101
TRAVIS: That's it?
MATT: From where you're standing.

2482
01:32:37.101 --> 01:32:39.034
You walk through.
TRAVIS: Okay, walk forward.

2483
01:32:39.034 --> 01:32:41.701
LAURA: Watch out, there could be holes in the ground

2484
01:32:41.701 --> 01:32:44.291
or something covered by the mist.

2485
01:32:44.291 --> 01:32:45.757
TALIESIN: Oh, actually, yeah, we can't

2486
01:32:45.757 --> 01:32:47.148
see the ground, can we?

2487
01:32:47.148 --> 01:32:48.273
MATT: No, you cannot-- bless you--

2488
01:32:48.273 --> 01:32:51.068
because as you get about 20 or so feet in,

2489
01:32:51.068 --> 01:32:53.168
the mist is about a foot high.
TALIESIN: Oh, no.

2490
01:32:53.168 --> 01:32:55.121
MATT: You get about halfway through, 30 feet,

2491
01:32:55.121 --> 01:32:57.349
and it's up to your knee.
TALIESIN: Okay.

2492
01:32:57.349 --> 01:32:58.323
TRAVIS: Hey, Yasha, on the count of three,

2493
01:32:58.323 --> 01:33:00.760
blow really hard, one, two, three.

2494
01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:03.853
(blowing) I just did it by myself, didn't I?

2495
01:33:03.853 --> 01:33:06.074
MARISHA: Yeah.
(laughter)

2496
01:33:06.074 --> 01:33:07.996
MATT: It swirls up a bit and picks up a bit.

2497
01:33:07.996 --> 01:33:09.051
TRAVIS: You guys see the ground for

2498
01:33:09.051 --> 01:33:11.691
a flash of a second when I did that?

2499
01:33:11.691 --> 01:33:13.747
MATT: The ones closest to you, a little bit.

2500
01:33:13.747 --> 01:33:15.846
TRAVIS: All right, now, if you fucking jump in the trap--

2501
01:33:15.846 --> 01:33:19.398
LAURA: I join, I join.
(both blowing)

2502
01:33:19.398 --> 01:33:20.373
MATT: All right.

2503
01:33:20.373 --> 01:33:22.577
It picks up a little bit and for about a foot ahead of you,

2504
01:33:22.577 --> 01:33:23.900
you can see some of the floor before the mist

2505
01:33:23.900 --> 01:33:25.804
gathers back into it.

2506
01:33:25.804 --> 01:33:26.637
TRAVIS: Similar to the floor

2507
01:33:26.637 --> 01:33:27.784
that we were just in in the other chamber?

2508
01:33:27.784 --> 01:33:29.219
MATT: Yep, just a standard stone floor.

2509
01:33:29.219 --> 01:33:30.976
ASHLEY: I'm going to take my cape.
MARISHA: Yeah.

2510
01:33:30.976 --> 01:33:32.639
I'm going to take my robe.

2511
01:33:32.639 --> 01:33:34.796
TALIESIN: Okay, this is, hm.

2512
01:33:34.796 --> 01:33:36.475
TRAVIS: I'll just walk forward a little bit.

2513
01:33:36.475 --> 01:33:39.331
TALIESIN: I've got a weirder idea.
MATT: Okay.

2514
01:33:39.331 --> 01:33:41.599
TALIESIN: I'm going to take my staff,

2515
01:33:41.599 --> 01:33:43.846
since I have my Light spell on the crystal,

2516
01:33:43.846 --> 01:33:46.014
and I'm going to put it in the mist

2517
01:33:46.014 --> 01:33:48.051
so that we can see any shadows in the mist

2518
01:33:48.051 --> 01:33:49.549
if something comes out down there.

2519
01:33:49.549 --> 01:33:50.382
MATT: Okay, cool.

2520
01:33:50.382 --> 01:33:51.508
You go ahead and put it down in the mist.

2521
01:33:51.508 --> 01:33:54.657
What it does is it makes the mist a little more opaque,

2522
01:33:54.657 --> 01:33:57.115
but it does keep tabs of any

2523
01:33:57.115 --> 01:33:58.663
shadows as you go through, so Caduceus,

2524
01:33:58.663 --> 01:33:59.863
are you moving up or are you staying where you are?

2525
01:33:59.863 --> 01:34:01.207
TALIESIN: I'm staying in the center of the group.

2526
01:34:01.207 --> 01:34:02.467
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: But keep tapping it

2527
01:34:02.467 --> 01:34:04.866
on the ground to make sure--
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's staying.

2528
01:34:04.866 --> 01:34:07.034
I'm using it as a dousing rod.

2529
01:34:07.034 --> 01:34:08.488
MATT: You guys are moving forward. You're just walking.

2530
01:34:08.488 --> 01:34:09.609
Yasha, you're using your cape

2531
01:34:09.609 --> 01:34:11.360
to try and blow it out of the way.

2532
01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:12.812
Okay, so you walk, you're getting close

2533
01:34:12.812 --> 01:34:14.312
to the edge of the chamber, looking ahead,

2534
01:34:14.312 --> 01:34:16.029
it looks like the wall comes to an end

2535
01:34:16.029 --> 01:34:16.915
from where you're standing.

2536
01:34:16.915 --> 01:34:18.080
TRAVIS: Can I look up?

2537
01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:19.065
MATT: Sure.

2538
01:34:19.065 --> 01:34:23.232
You walk forward. Make a perception check.

2539
01:34:24.428 --> 01:34:26.338
TRAVIS: That is a 14.

2540
01:34:26.338 --> 01:34:29.348
MATT: 14, you look up, and the best that you can tell,

2541
01:34:29.348 --> 01:34:31.411
the ceiling comes and it comes to an endpoint

2542
01:34:31.411 --> 01:34:33.496
with the edge of the wall.
TRAVIS: Oh.

2543
01:34:33.496 --> 01:34:37.159
MARISHA: I'm going to take out a ball bearing.

2544
01:34:37.159 --> 01:34:38.431
Throw it at the edge of the wall.

2545
01:34:38.431 --> 01:34:40.101
MATT: You're going to throw it, okay.

2546
01:34:40.101 --> 01:34:41.526
Ting, ting.

2547
01:34:42.992 --> 01:34:43.825
LAURA: There's a hole in the ground.

2548
01:34:43.825 --> 01:34:45.525
MARISHA: There's a fucking hole in the ground.

2549
01:34:45.525 --> 01:34:46.591
SAM: What?

2550
01:34:46.591 --> 01:34:47.616
TALIESIN: I think it just bounced off the wall.

2551
01:34:47.616 --> 01:34:48.857
MATT: Ting.

2552
01:34:48.857 --> 01:34:50.734
Like a distant echo.
(oohing)

2553
01:34:50.734 --> 01:34:53.119
TRAVIS: Fuck, that's a long ass fall.

2554
01:34:53.119 --> 01:34:53.952
MARISHA: Okay, all right, all right.

2555
01:34:53.952 --> 01:34:55.935
TALIESIN: Finally those ball bearings serve a purpose.

2556
01:34:55.935 --> 01:34:58.763
TRAVIS: (startled laughter)

2557
01:34:58.763 --> 01:35:00.371
MARISHA: Hey! Yeah.

2558
01:35:01.734 --> 01:35:04.110
LIAM: Could you do the cape thing again?

2559
01:35:04.110 --> 01:35:06.124
Could we try to see what we're dealing with here?

2560
01:35:06.124 --> 01:35:08.216
MATT: You guys come a little closer.

2561
01:35:08.216 --> 01:35:11.409
It's exhausting to do so, to try and fill it off.

2562
01:35:11.409 --> 01:35:14.085
I'll say to this point, is it just Yasha doing this?

2563
01:35:14.085 --> 01:35:15.461
LAURA: I'll help.

2564
01:35:15.461 --> 01:35:17.063
SAM: She's doing it with rage.
MATT: Jester and Yasha,

2565
01:35:17.063 --> 01:35:19.143
both make a constitution saving throw for me, please.

2566
01:35:19.143 --> 01:35:22.216
ASHLEY: Constitution saving throws?
MATT: Yes.

2567
01:35:22.216 --> 01:35:23.049
ASHLEY: Okay.

2568
01:35:24.391 --> 01:35:25.224
LAURA: 16!

2569
01:35:28.065 --> 01:35:28.985
ASHLEY: 14.

2570
01:35:28.985 --> 01:35:30.318
MATT: Not a problem.

2571
01:35:31.213 --> 01:35:32.197
You continue to move forward

2572
01:35:32.197 --> 01:35:33.721
and the mist separates a bit

2573
01:35:33.721 --> 01:35:35.820
and as you guys get towards the very edge,

2574
01:35:35.820 --> 01:35:37.823
about five feet from the far wall,

2575
01:35:37.823 --> 01:35:39.781
not at the actual, but five feet beforehand,

2576
01:35:39.781 --> 01:35:42.193
about five feet from where Fjord was walking,

2577
01:35:42.193 --> 01:35:44.318
you can see, there's a portion of the floor

2578
01:35:44.318 --> 01:35:48.157
about 10 feet across that is open

2579
01:35:48.157 --> 01:35:51.276
and there is a staircase that descends down.

2580
01:35:51.276 --> 01:35:54.723
LIAM: Is this mist coming up out of this?

2581
01:35:54.723 --> 01:35:57.458
MATT: The entire area below is suffused with mist.

2582
01:35:57.458 --> 01:36:01.520
You see the stairs vanish below, out of sight.

2583
01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:03.806
LIAM: I'm bringing up Dancing Lights

2584
01:36:03.806 --> 01:36:07.173
and there's four globules in addition to Caduceus'.

2585
01:36:07.173 --> 01:36:09.840
TALIESIN: Is there a taste to this mist?

2586
01:36:10.806 --> 01:36:11.639
Does it taste

2587
01:36:11.639 --> 01:36:13.182
or smell like anything?
LAURA: Or smell?

2588
01:36:13.182 --> 01:36:16.962
MATT: The smell-- it's pretty pure smelling, actually.

2589
01:36:16.962 --> 01:36:19.629
It's just a moist, watered mist.

2590
01:36:20.762 --> 01:36:22.124
TRAVIS: I don't mean to object, but--

2591
01:36:22.124 --> 01:36:23.563
TALIESIN: Not sulfurous, okay.

2592
01:36:23.563 --> 01:36:25.026
TRAVIS: Shouldn't those of us with some darkvision go ahead

2593
01:36:25.026 --> 01:36:26.309
instead of lighting up the mist?

2594
01:36:26.309 --> 01:36:29.321
It'll really illuminate our arrival.

2595
01:36:29.321 --> 01:36:31.712
TALIESIN: Fair.
MARISHA: I have darkvision.

2596
01:36:31.712 --> 01:36:32.545
TRAVIS: I do, too.

2597
01:36:32.545 --> 01:36:34.163
ASHLEY: Okay, we can go.
MARISHA: Go.

2598
01:36:34.163 --> 01:36:35.442
SAM: Have fun in there, boys and girls.

2599
01:36:35.442 --> 01:36:36.294
TRAVIS: You have darkvision, don't you?

2600
01:36:36.294 --> 01:36:37.637
SAM: Sure, I do, but--
TALIESIN: It's just the two of us.

2601
01:36:37.637 --> 01:36:39.549
SAM: --mist is made of water and, you know, I'm not--

2602
01:36:39.549 --> 01:36:40.637
MATT: (laughs)

2603
01:36:40.637 --> 01:36:41.936
LIAM: I have something I can do--

2604
01:36:41.936 --> 01:36:42.769
MATT: So is booze.

2605
01:36:42.769 --> 01:36:44.525
LIAM: --just for me, besides Light

2606
01:36:44.525 --> 01:36:45.622
but you need light.

2607
01:36:45.622 --> 01:36:48.005
TALIESIN: I will assume that when the time comes,

2608
01:36:48.005 --> 01:36:50.106
we will light up the room.

2609
01:36:50.106 --> 01:36:51.114
TRAVIS: We can let you know,

2610
01:36:51.114 --> 01:36:52.764
but let's try and be stealthy, yeah?

2611
01:36:54.006 --> 01:36:55.434
MATT: The spiral staircase is thin.

2612
01:36:55.434 --> 01:36:58.674
It's about, I'd say, three feet wide,

2613
01:36:58.674 --> 01:37:01.465
so this is a single-fire-- single-file journey going down.

2614
01:37:01.465 --> 01:37:03.191
MARISHA: Single fire.
MATT: Single fire.

2615
01:37:03.191 --> 01:37:04.141
So who's going down first?

2616
01:37:04.141 --> 01:37:05.316
TRAVIS: I don't mind going first.

2617
01:37:05.316 --> 01:37:06.567
MATT: Fjord's going first. Who's after Fjord?

2618
01:37:06.567 --> 01:37:10.058
MARISHA: I'll follow Fjord. I got pretty good stealth.

2619
01:37:10.058 --> 01:37:12.048
LAURA: I'll stay behind Yasha.

2620
01:37:12.048 --> 01:37:13.061
MATT: All righty. Caduceus, staying where you are?

2621
01:37:13.061 --> 01:37:15.438
TALIESIN: Yeah, I think this is a good marching order.

2622
01:37:15.438 --> 01:37:16.926
MATT: Then same thing with--?
LIAM: I don't think

2623
01:37:16.926 --> 01:37:19.039
that the two blind people should be right--

2624
01:37:19.039 --> 01:37:20.877
I think you should space us amongst the group.

2625
01:37:20.877 --> 01:37:22.592
SAM: I can see. I'm back here with you.

2626
01:37:22.592 --> 01:37:24.525
TALIESIN: Oh, then let's-- maybe, Nott,

2627
01:37:24.525 --> 01:37:26.458
let's put you in between the two of us.

2628
01:37:26.458 --> 01:37:27.291
SAM: Between?

2629
01:37:27.291 --> 01:37:30.205
LIAM: Or a taller person between us.

2630
01:37:30.205 --> 01:37:32.040
MARISHA: Do a daisy chain?
LAURA: Yeah, that's true.

2631
01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:34.756
SAM: I'd better be in back in case anything comes behind us.

2632
01:37:34.756 --> 01:37:36.122
LIAM: One person to stand between

2633
01:37:36.122 --> 01:37:37.688
Caduceus and I who can see.

2634
01:37:37.688 --> 01:37:41.069
LAURA: I'll go between Caduceus and you.

2635
01:37:41.069 --> 01:37:42.942
TRAVIS: You better follow us down.

2636
01:37:42.942 --> 01:37:44.203
LAURA: I don't know if you want the--

2637
01:37:44.203 --> 01:37:46.208
TALIESIN: Two clerics together.

2638
01:37:46.208 --> 01:37:49.911
LAURA: Maybe Caduceus and Yasha switch places, too?

2639
01:37:49.911 --> 01:37:50.961
TALIESIN: Sure, sure.

2640
01:37:50.961 --> 01:37:53.197
TRAVIS: Want me to cast Water Breathing on you?

2641
01:37:53.197 --> 01:37:54.745
TALIESIN: I like that.
LAURA: That way you can--

2642
01:37:54.745 --> 01:37:56.921
SAM: I have a ring of water walking.

2643
01:37:56.921 --> 01:37:58.132
Maybe I can walk on the mist.

2644
01:37:58.132 --> 01:37:59.697
I try to walk on the mist.

2645
01:37:59.697 --> 01:38:00.832
MATT: Okay.

2646
01:38:00.832 --> 01:38:03.461
You step out towards the mist.

2647
01:38:03.461 --> 01:38:05.961
Make a dexterity saving throw.

2648
01:38:07.109 --> 01:38:08.657
SAM: Save, 21.

2649
01:38:08.657 --> 01:38:09.490
MATT: 21.

2650
01:38:09.490 --> 01:38:11.786
You step out (whooshes) and immediately just

2651
01:38:11.786 --> 01:38:14.973
fall through. You reach up and grab both sides of the corner

2652
01:38:14.973 --> 01:38:17.513
where you almost fell and holding yourself in place,

2653
01:38:17.513 --> 01:38:19.061
realize that's not going to work.

2654
01:38:19.061 --> 01:38:20.276
SAM: Doesn't work.
MATT: You barely get yourself

2655
01:38:20.276 --> 01:38:23.744
back up and (sighs).
SAM: No problem.

2656
01:38:23.744 --> 01:38:24.603
TRAVIS: Good deal.

2657
01:38:24.603 --> 01:38:25.819
All right, we descend.

2658
01:38:25.819 --> 01:38:28.780
LIAM: You said it's very thin, this stairwell?

2659
01:38:28.780 --> 01:38:31.670
MATT: It's three feet across, yeah.

2660
01:38:31.670 --> 01:38:34.288
LIAM: I'm taking Nott and Jester's hands in my hands

2661
01:38:34.288 --> 01:38:35.846
because I can't see shit.
MATT: Okay.

2662
01:38:35.846 --> 01:38:37.314
LAURA: Just hold onto my shoulders, Caleb.

2663
01:38:37.314 --> 01:38:39.399
TRAVIS: Can I take the first two steps

2664
01:38:39.399 --> 01:38:43.169
and then reach out to try and feel a wall to my right?

2665
01:38:43.169 --> 01:38:44.283
MATT: Mm-hm.

2666
01:38:44.283 --> 01:38:46.495
As you guys head down the staircase,

2667
01:38:46.495 --> 01:38:51.084
the first thing you notice is there is a wall to your

2668
01:38:51.084 --> 01:38:52.251
left, I think.

2669
01:38:54.111 --> 01:38:56.777
TALIESIN: If it goes clockwise, it's the left.

2670
01:38:56.777 --> 01:38:57.806
If it's counter-clockwise, it's the right.

2671
01:38:57.806 --> 01:39:00.107
MATT: I'm pretty sure it's to the left.

2672
01:39:00.107 --> 01:39:02.110
You continue to spiral down

2673
01:39:02.110 --> 01:39:03.790
and there is an actual, a solid wall.

2674
01:39:03.790 --> 01:39:05.845
As you put your hand out and touch it, it is moist

2675
01:39:05.845 --> 01:39:07.717
from the mist that gathers here.

2676
01:39:07.717 --> 01:39:09.276
TRAVIS: If you reach your hand out to the left,

2677
01:39:09.276 --> 01:39:11.538
you'll feel the wall. It's a little moist.

2678
01:39:11.538 --> 01:39:14.213
We're moving down in a particular direction.

2679
01:39:14.213 --> 01:39:15.046
MATT: Okay.

2680
01:39:16.959 --> 01:39:18.459
As you're walking,

2681
01:39:21.941 --> 01:39:23.308
the mist itself is pretty thick.

2682
01:39:23.308 --> 01:39:26.077
You can see probably no more than 10 feet ahead of you.

2683
01:39:26.077 --> 01:39:28.489
You can just barely see the outline of the stairs below.

2684
01:39:28.489 --> 01:39:29.957
LAURA: Just keep blowing, Fjord.

2685
01:39:29.957 --> 01:39:32.861
TRAVIS: So stealthy and slow.

2686
01:39:32.861 --> 01:39:35.439
MATT: All right.
TRAVIS: The tap of the foot

2687
01:39:35.439 --> 01:39:38.704
to the edge, keeping the weight on your back foot,

2688
01:39:38.704 --> 01:39:40.550
slowly putting pressure on the next step

2689
01:39:40.550 --> 01:39:42.159
in case it gives way or something like that.

2690
01:39:42.159 --> 01:39:43.960
MATT: Okay, stealth check from everybody, please.

2691
01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:45.520
MARISHA: Stealth check?
TALIESIN: Stealth check.

2692
01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:48.187
LIAM: I'm smearing against the wall.

2693
01:39:49.850 --> 01:39:50.947
TRAVIS: 16.

2694
01:39:50.947 --> 01:39:51.780
MARISHA: 15.

2695
01:39:52.876 --> 01:39:54.673
LIAM: Nine.
SAM: 25.

2696
01:39:54.673 --> 01:39:55.506
LAURA: 15.
TALIESIN: 12.

2697
01:39:56.415 --> 01:39:58.182
ASHLEY: Ten.
MATT: Okay.

2698
01:39:59.628 --> 01:40:04.034
You guys continue down the first 20 or so feet,

2699
01:40:04.034 --> 01:40:05.906
carefully making it down, daisy chaining through,

2700
01:40:05.906 --> 01:40:08.039
each of you slowly emerging.

2701
01:40:08.039 --> 01:40:09.180
You guys watch as your friends just

2702
01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:13.434
slowly vanish into the mist, one by one, below.

2703
01:40:13.434 --> 01:40:16.134
Until, eventually, you take the plunge

2704
01:40:16.134 --> 01:40:19.086
and you can see the shoulders of your friend ahead of you,

2705
01:40:19.086 --> 01:40:21.891
most of the head, and then it becomes shapes after that,

2706
01:40:21.891 --> 01:40:23.103
and then a few feet beyond that,

2707
01:40:23.103 --> 01:40:27.440
it becomes very, very faint shadows and then nothing.

2708
01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:30.000
It's this creepy silence

2709
01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:31.756
as you continue downward.

2710
01:40:31.756 --> 01:40:34.345
TRAVIS: Can I stop for a second?
MATT: Sure.

2711
01:40:34.345 --> 01:40:35.921
TRAVIS: Hands on the wall--
MARISHA: Oh, ow!

2712
01:40:35.921 --> 01:40:37.645
TRAVIS: Sorry, wait, wait, wait.

2713
01:40:37.645 --> 01:40:41.061
Do we feel any kind of vibration in the walls?

2714
01:40:41.061 --> 01:40:42.042
MATT: Make a perception check.

2715
01:40:42.042 --> 01:40:43.344
LAURA and MARISHA: (laugh)

2716
01:40:43.344 --> 01:40:44.735
MARISHA: I'm glad everyone went with us.

2717
01:40:44.735 --> 01:40:48.217
TRAVIS: Natural 18 for 20.

2718
01:40:48.217 --> 01:40:52.397
MATT: You put a hand to it. Everyone stays quiet. You feel

2719
01:40:52.397 --> 01:40:53.983
no vibration.
TRAVIS: Okay.

2720
01:40:53.983 --> 01:40:54.958
Keep moving ahead.

2721
01:40:54.958 --> 01:40:56.708
MARISHA: Can you warn a bitch next time?

2722
01:40:57.831 --> 01:40:59.523
TALIESIN: We're trying to be careful.
LAURA: Are we moving again?

2723
01:40:59.523 --> 01:41:04.430
MATT: You continue down for another 20 or so feet down.

2724
01:41:04.430 --> 01:41:07.706
As you move, hand on the wall, (click)

2725
01:41:07.706 --> 01:41:09.520
your foot hits one of the stone steps

2726
01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:11.696
and you feel it just (clicks) depress.

2727
01:41:11.696 --> 01:41:12.821
TRAVIS: Wait, stop, stop, stop!

2728
01:41:12.821 --> 01:41:14.523
MATT: Ever so faintly.
TRAVIS: Stop, stop, stop, stop!

2729
01:41:14.523 --> 01:41:15.823
MATT: It stops, your foot catches it,

2730
01:41:15.823 --> 01:41:19.141
but you step on the foot and you feel it give just slightly.

2731
01:41:19.141 --> 01:41:20.962
TRAVIS: Where's Nott?

2732
01:41:20.962 --> 01:41:22.225
MARISHA: She's in the back.

2733
01:41:22.225 --> 01:41:24.232
TRAVIS: Yeah, tell her to come up to the front.

2734
01:41:24.232 --> 01:41:25.647
TALIESIN: Nott, we're going to need you over here.

2735
01:41:25.647 --> 01:41:27.911
MARISHA: Turn down the train, pass it down the line.

2736
01:41:27.911 --> 01:41:28.921
ASHLEY: Pass it down the line!
MATT: Caduceus.

2737
01:41:28.921 --> 01:41:30.810
While they're doing this, you

2738
01:41:30.810 --> 01:41:35.627
hear the phrase, you're listening out there and you and...

2739
01:41:37.597 --> 01:41:40.382
you're the only one, actually,

2740
01:41:40.382 --> 01:41:43.799
you hear this (low hum),

2741
01:41:46.068 --> 01:41:51.068
this very, very, very subtle hum.

2742
01:41:51.467 --> 01:41:55.234
TALIESIN: Is it a building hum or is it a steady hum?

2743
01:41:55.234 --> 01:41:57.009
MATT: It's a steady hum.

2744
01:41:57.900 --> 01:42:02.633
Then the pitch begins to slowly (pitch increases).

2745
01:42:02.633 --> 01:42:04.191
TALIESIN: Something's happening.

2746
01:42:04.191 --> 01:42:07.133
I think you triggered it. We should probably go.

2747
01:42:07.133 --> 01:42:10.226
LAURA: Oh, no, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

2748
01:42:10.226 --> 01:42:11.645
SAM: Oh boy!

2749
01:42:11.645 --> 01:42:13.325
LAURA: Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no!
MARISHA: Oh, fuck!

2750
01:42:13.325 --> 01:42:15.211
We should go. We should just go!

2751
01:42:15.211 --> 01:42:16.547
MATT: I need to go ahead and get the--

2752
01:42:16.547 --> 01:42:17.630
TRAVIS: Oh no!

2753
01:42:20.439 --> 01:42:22.673
SAM: Something's happening again.

2754
01:42:22.673 --> 01:42:23.944
I don't know what,

2755
01:42:23.944 --> 01:42:27.496
but Dwarven Forge is related to it somehow.

2756
01:42:27.496 --> 01:42:28.887
The combat cam--
LAURA: What if it's--

2757
01:42:28.887 --> 01:42:30.793
SAM: --is Dwarven Forge--
LAURA: --like a ball,

2758
01:42:30.793 --> 01:42:33.728
like Indiana Jones and it starts rolling down the stairs.

2759
01:42:33.728 --> 01:42:36.481
MARISHA: Or like collapsing ceiling.

2760
01:42:36.481 --> 01:42:37.722
LAURA: Yeah, or what if we're all rising up

2761
01:42:37.722 --> 01:42:38.758
and we don't even know it.

2762
01:42:38.758 --> 01:42:40.510
TRAVIS: Oh, shit!

2763
01:42:40.510 --> 01:42:42.886
SAM: Our impending doom is brought to you by Dwarven Forge.

2764
01:42:42.886 --> 01:42:46.215
ASHLEY: Oh my god.
MARISHA: What?!

2765
01:42:46.215 --> 01:42:48.999
SAM: Dwarven Forge sponsored the Mighty Nein's death.

2766
01:42:51.601 --> 01:42:55.627
LAURA: How does this work?
TALIESIN: I'm so not okay.

2767
01:42:55.627 --> 01:42:58.965
MATT: So Fjord, you are up there at the moment.

2768
01:42:58.965 --> 01:43:00.081
SAM: I don't understand.

2769
01:43:00.081 --> 01:43:02.197
LIAM: Maybe one of us is a representative?

2770
01:43:02.197 --> 01:43:06.165
TALIESIN: Oh no, it means this is all coming down.

2771
01:43:06.165 --> 01:43:07.634
SAM: Maybe.

2772
01:43:07.634 --> 01:43:08.881
Is this The Goonies?

2773
01:43:08.881 --> 01:43:10.333
Are we the Goonies?

2774
01:43:10.333 --> 01:43:13.017
TALIESIN: We are going to be Goonie jam.

2775
01:43:13.017 --> 01:43:15.410
ASHLEY: Jester, you play piano.

2776
01:43:15.410 --> 01:43:17.641
LIAM: Fjord, Fjord, do the truffle shuffle.

2777
01:43:17.641 --> 01:43:21.224
SAM: Booty trapped.

2778
01:43:23.665 --> 01:43:27.748
What is this?
TRAVIS: (worried shouting)

2779
01:43:29.866 --> 01:43:31.866
TALIESIN: Ow, sorry, microphone.

2780
01:43:33.207 --> 01:43:35.674
TALIESIN: Oh no.

2781
01:43:35.674 --> 01:43:37.257
This is so unhappy.

2782
01:43:38.193 --> 01:43:39.484
This is so unhappy.

2783
01:43:39.484 --> 01:43:40.541
SAM: Ow, shit.

2784
01:43:40.541 --> 01:43:41.374
TRAVIS: Really?

2785
01:43:41.374 --> 01:43:42.696
Really?
MATT: You're just doing this

2786
01:43:42.696 --> 01:43:43.529
over and over and over again.
LAURA: Sorry, Chris.

2787
01:43:44.579 --> 01:43:46.635
MATT: Sorry, Chris. Sorry about that.

2788
01:43:46.635 --> 01:43:48.770
TRAVIS: (loudly into mic) Sorry, guys.

2789
01:43:48.770 --> 01:43:51.739
SAM: You just deafened someone at home.

2790
01:43:51.739 --> 01:43:53.226
MATT: All right.

2791
01:43:53.226 --> 01:43:55.954
So Fjord, you just barely see down

2792
01:43:55.954 --> 01:43:58.540
into the next element of the chamber, so,

2793
01:43:58.540 --> 01:44:00.414
yeah, heading out was the right side.

2794
01:44:00.414 --> 01:44:03.123
SAM: So wait, are these connected?

2795
01:44:03.123 --> 01:44:04.706
LIAM: Yeah. It's not on a diagonal.

2796
01:44:04.706 --> 01:44:05.898
It's one on top of the other.

2797
01:44:05.898 --> 01:44:08.150
TRAVIS: We can see straight down the shaft, right?

2798
01:44:08.150 --> 01:44:09.778
MATT: Correct, so,

2799
01:44:09.778 --> 01:44:12.230
the hum is slowly increasing.
TALIESIN: I cast Resistance.

2800
01:44:12.230 --> 01:44:13.601
MATT: Everyone roll initiative, please.

2801
01:44:13.601 --> 01:44:15.928
This is part of this now.

2802
01:44:15.928 --> 01:44:19.367
LAURA: Oh god.
TRAVIS: (clapping) Woo!

2803
01:44:19.367 --> 01:44:21.668
Good shit, Matt. Good shit!

2804
01:44:21.668 --> 01:44:22.513
MARISHA: That's better.

2805
01:44:22.513 --> 01:44:24.881
TRAVIS: Fuck you!

2806
01:44:24.881 --> 01:44:26.786
SAM: ♪ I had a feeling ♪

2807
01:44:26.786 --> 01:44:28.619
ALL: ♪ Ooh hoo ♪

2808
01:44:29.592 --> 01:44:31.176
LIAM: Oh, man.
TRAVIS: Is that Guns N' Roses?

2809
01:44:33.116 --> 01:44:35.835
MARISHA: ♪ That this fight's gonna be a good fight ♪

2810
01:44:35.835 --> 01:44:37.133
MATT: 25 to 20.

2811
01:44:37.133 --> 01:44:38.560
ASHLEY and MARISHA: 20.

2812
01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:39.994
SAM: Wow!

2813
01:44:39.994 --> 01:44:41.311
LAURA: 20 twins!

2814
01:44:41.311 --> 01:44:42.728
MATT: Yasha and Beau.

2815
01:44:44.084 --> 01:44:45.193
ASHLEY: Sentinel babes.

2816
01:44:45.193 --> 01:44:46.026
MATT: 20 to 15.

2817
01:44:47.789 --> 01:44:49.372
TRAVIS: 20 to 15, no one.

2818
01:44:51.362 --> 01:44:52.794
MATT: 15 to ten.

2819
01:44:52.794 --> 01:44:53.627
LIAM: 13.

2820
01:44:54.509 --> 01:44:57.228
TRAVIS: 15 to ten, that's it?
LIAM: 15 to ten, anybody?

2821
01:44:57.228 --> 01:44:58.313
TRAVIS: Oh, wow.

2822
01:44:58.313 --> 01:45:00.298
LIAM: Holy shit.
MARISHA: Wait, what, no one?

2823
01:45:00.298 --> 01:45:01.662
MATT: All right, ten to five.

2824
01:45:01.662 --> 01:45:02.756
TALIESIN: Eight.
SAM: Seven.

2825
01:45:02.756 --> 01:45:05.006
LAURA: Six.
LIAM: Whoa.

2826
01:45:05.006 --> 01:45:08.423
TRAVIS: So Caduceus, Nott, Fjord, Jester.

2827
01:45:09.957 --> 01:45:11.457
SAM and LAURA: Technically--

2828
01:45:11.457 --> 01:45:12.825
SAM: Nott, Caduceus,

2829
01:45:12.825 --> 01:45:14.686
because I have--
MATT: That's true.

2830
01:45:14.686 --> 01:45:16.646
SAM: I have a higher dex.

2831
01:45:16.646 --> 01:45:17.896
I'm assuming.

2832
01:45:19.095 --> 01:45:19.928
because you're a big cow man.

2833
01:45:19.928 --> 01:45:24.128
TALIESIN: Yeah. My dex is 12.

2834
01:45:24.128 --> 01:45:25.054
MATT: Yasha and Beau,

2835
01:45:25.054 --> 01:45:27.170
what are you guys doing?
LAURA: Oh, ah, it started!

2836
01:45:27.170 --> 01:45:29.989
TALIESIN: Go, go, go, go!

2837
01:45:29.989 --> 01:45:31.452
LIAM: Wake up--
ASHLEY: I mean, I can't move

2838
01:45:31.452 --> 01:45:32.604
because everyone's there, I don't know what--

2839
01:45:32.604 --> 01:45:33.804
MATT: You can move through your friends.

2840
01:45:33.804 --> 01:45:34.824
You can carefully push past.

2841
01:45:34.824 --> 01:45:36.975
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll start moving down.

2842
01:45:36.975 --> 01:45:39.424
MARISHA: I'm going to spend a ki point

2843
01:45:39.424 --> 01:45:41.299
and cast Step of the Wind.

2844
01:45:41.299 --> 01:45:43.015
MATT: 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40

2845
01:45:43.015 --> 01:45:43.914
TRAVIS: On who?

2846
01:45:43.914 --> 01:45:44.780
MARISHA: Myself.

2847
01:45:44.780 --> 01:45:46.071
MATT: You are almost around here.

2848
01:45:46.071 --> 01:45:48.257
You use your action to move again?

2849
01:45:48.257 --> 01:45:49.962
ASHLEY: Ch'yeah.

2850
01:45:49.962 --> 01:45:51.676
LAURA: Did you just do it again?

2851
01:45:51.676 --> 01:45:54.496
SAM: I can't leave and I can't [inaudible] anything.

2852
01:45:54.496 --> 01:45:56.954
MATT: You are at the top of the stair there.

2853
01:45:56.954 --> 01:45:59.761
There's a rotation through each of these.

2854
01:45:59.761 --> 01:46:01.275
Beau.
MARISHA: Step of the Wind.

2855
01:46:01.275 --> 01:46:05.115
MATT: Step of the Wind.
MARISHA: 90 feet.

2856
01:46:05.115 --> 01:46:06.531
MATT: Correct, so that brings you--

2857
01:46:06.531 --> 01:46:08.030
LIAM: Is this a giant, empty cylinder?

2858
01:46:08.030 --> 01:46:09.987
MATT: Correct.
LIAM: Okay.

2859
01:46:09.987 --> 01:46:12.412
MARISHA: I'm sorry!

2860
01:46:12.412 --> 01:46:14.662
Freaking out!
LIAM: It's hidden.

2861
01:46:16.805 --> 01:46:18.864
MATT: So action or just movement?

2862
01:46:18.864 --> 01:46:21.039
Movement will get you about there.

2863
01:46:21.039 --> 01:46:23.163
MARISHA: Oh, right, right.

2864
01:46:23.163 --> 01:46:24.829
Action, move again.

2865
01:46:24.829 --> 01:46:27.221
MATT: Okay, that gets you around.

2866
01:46:27.221 --> 01:46:29.480
LAURA: Watch out for traps, though, as you walk.

2867
01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:30.313
Don't do it again.

2868
01:46:30.313 --> 01:46:31.428
TRAVIS: I think we already tripped the one.

2869
01:46:31.428 --> 01:46:33.912
LAURA: There might be more.

2870
01:46:33.912 --> 01:46:37.440
MARISHA: In Step of the Wind, I'm moving again.

2871
01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:40.056
MATT: Full move got you to there.

2872
01:46:41.461 --> 01:46:43.212
You double moved, you double moved and got there,

2873
01:46:43.212 --> 01:46:46.377
so, yeah, with Step of the Wind, it would be--

2874
01:46:46.377 --> 01:46:47.617
TALIESIN: You can walk on the wall.

2875
01:46:47.617 --> 01:46:48.848
You can run on the walls.
MATT: Well, she can

2876
01:46:48.848 --> 01:46:50.210
until the end of her turn.

2877
01:46:50.210 --> 01:46:51.765
LAURA: But the walls are slick, too.

2878
01:46:51.765 --> 01:46:54.247
TALIESIN: That's fair.
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

2879
01:46:54.247 --> 01:46:55.448
ASHLEY: What if you just jump straight down?

2880
01:46:55.448 --> 01:46:57.694
MARISHA: I know, just slide down.

2881
01:46:57.694 --> 01:46:59.800
TRAVIS: Is there open space in the middle?

2882
01:46:59.800 --> 01:47:01.570
MATT: Yeah, it's an open drop,

2883
01:47:01.570 --> 01:47:02.423
like there's a wall on one side

2884
01:47:02.423 --> 01:47:03.256
and there's nothing on this side

2885
01:47:03.256 --> 01:47:05.000
and, as you guys look over, and you hear that hum,

2886
01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:06.812
you look down and it's just

2887
01:47:06.812 --> 01:47:08.351
ten feet down is as much as you can see.

2888
01:47:08.351 --> 01:47:10.112
TRAVIS: Because there's still a fucking shit load of mist.

2889
01:47:10.112 --> 01:47:12.019
MATT: Correct.
TRAVIS: Any light down there?

2890
01:47:12.019 --> 01:47:13.201
Nothing, just--
MATT: Nothing.

2891
01:47:13.201 --> 01:47:14.657
It's just the light you guys have, which is nothing.

2892
01:47:14.657 --> 01:47:15.831
It is dark.

2893
01:47:15.831 --> 01:47:18.210
All right, that finishes your guys' turns.

2894
01:47:18.210 --> 01:47:19.977
ASHLEY: How long is that timer?

2895
01:47:19.977 --> 01:47:21.257
MATT: You don't know.
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.

2896
01:47:21.257 --> 01:47:23.031
MARISHA: Go, go, go, go.

2897
01:47:23.031 --> 01:47:24.082
We're out of time.

2898
01:47:24.082 --> 01:47:25.323
MATT: (whooshes)

2899
01:47:25.323 --> 01:47:28.131
TRAVIS: No, no, no, no, no!

2900
01:47:28.131 --> 01:47:30.536
What is that?!
(screaming)

2901
01:47:30.536 --> 01:47:31.490
MATT: This right there.

2902
01:47:31.490 --> 01:47:32.960
LAURA: Oh my god!

2903
01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:34.735
LIAM: (laughs)

2904
01:47:34.735 --> 01:47:35.985
MARISHA: I am so far down.

2905
01:47:35.985 --> 01:47:38.205
MATT: The mist seems to take a weird shape.

2906
01:47:38.205 --> 01:47:40.417
From the movement, you see a face

2907
01:47:40.417 --> 01:47:41.984
emerge from it

2908
01:47:41.984 --> 01:47:45.477
and these angry wisps of a arm reach out

2909
01:47:45.477 --> 01:47:48.727
towards Jester and Caduceus at the top.

2910
01:47:49.785 --> 01:47:51.405
LIAM: It was nice knowing you, Beau!

2911
01:47:51.405 --> 01:47:54.525
MATT: Against Jester, that is going to be a 17 to hit?

2912
01:47:54.525 --> 01:47:55.974
LAURA: Doesn't hit me.

2913
01:47:55.974 --> 01:47:58.035
MATT: Knocks off the shield.

2914
01:47:58.035 --> 01:48:01.614
Caduceus, another 17 to hit.
TALIESIN: Does not hit.

2915
01:48:01.614 --> 01:48:03.190
MATT: No effect.

2916
01:48:03.190 --> 01:48:05.193
Then it pulls away to vanish.

2917
01:48:05.193 --> 01:48:07.052
You guys both get attacks of opportunity.

2918
01:48:07.052 --> 01:48:08.707
LAURA: Yeah!
MATT: With disadvantage.

2919
01:48:08.707 --> 01:48:10.182
LAURA: Okay.

2920
01:48:10.182 --> 01:48:13.452
TALIESIN: Was it-- was that a ghost?

2921
01:48:13.452 --> 01:48:15.709
TALIESIN and MATT: You don't know.

2922
01:48:15.709 --> 01:48:17.829
TALIESIN: All right, with disadvantage, I'm going to do a--

2923
01:48:17.829 --> 01:48:19.890
LAURA: That's a natural one for me.

2924
01:48:19.890 --> 01:48:21.335
TALIESIN: Sacred Flame.

2925
01:48:21.335 --> 01:48:22.519
MATT: It's an attack of opportunity,

2926
01:48:22.519 --> 01:48:23.527
unless you have War Caster.

2927
01:48:23.527 --> 01:48:24.360
TALIESIN: I do have War Caster.

2928
01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:25.364
MATT: Yes, you can. All right.

2929
01:48:25.364 --> 01:48:26.459
TALIESIN: It's dex save.

2930
01:48:26.459 --> 01:48:28.891
MATT: Dex save. That is going to be a 13.

2931
01:48:28.891 --> 01:48:29.724
TALIESIN and MATT: Nope.

2932
01:48:29.724 --> 01:48:31.007
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage.

2933
01:48:31.007 --> 01:48:33.007
LAURA: The back of your head?

2934
01:48:34.243 --> 01:48:39.157
TALIESIN: There we are. That's 15 radiant.

2935
01:48:39.157 --> 01:48:41.072
MATT: 15 radiant damage, nice.

2936
01:48:41.072 --> 01:48:42.248
LAURA: Ooh, does that burn away mist?

2937
01:48:42.248 --> 01:48:44.158
MATT: It burns, outside of its body,

2938
01:48:44.158 --> 01:48:46.716
and it (growls). It vanishes into the mist.

2939
01:48:46.716 --> 01:48:49.256
It took some damage and now you have no idea where it is.

2940
01:48:49.256 --> 01:48:50.437
All right, that ends its go.

2941
01:48:50.437 --> 01:48:51.270
Caleb, you're up.

2942
01:48:51.270 --> 01:48:54.057
LIAM: I just start--

2943
01:48:54.057 --> 01:48:57.122
okay, so I pull out the Driftglobe.

2944
01:48:57.122 --> 01:48:58.803
I am in pitch dark and I am lighting up

2945
01:48:58.803 --> 01:49:00.239
the entire chamber with it.

2946
01:49:00.239 --> 01:49:01.319
I cast Daylight.

2947
01:49:01.319 --> 01:49:03.659
MATT: It's your action to activate the globe.

2948
01:49:03.659 --> 01:49:05.517
The room opens up.

2949
01:49:05.517 --> 01:49:08.468
It's very bright. It also makes the entire chamber opaque

2950
01:49:08.468 --> 01:49:12.359
in the heavy mist, so your visibility is somewhat unchanged.

2951
01:49:12.359 --> 01:49:14.510
LIAM: It went from pitch black to pitch white?

2952
01:49:14.510 --> 01:49:16.983
SAM: and MARISHA: That's like high beams in fog.

2953
01:49:16.983 --> 01:49:18.887
LIAM: But I would not be able

2954
01:49:18.887 --> 01:49:20.363
to see this before, I can at least see--

2955
01:49:20.363 --> 01:49:22.788
MATT: You can at least see ten feet around you.

2956
01:49:22.788 --> 01:49:24.839
LIAM: That's better than I was.

2957
01:49:24.839 --> 01:49:27.305
I just start...

2958
01:49:27.305 --> 01:49:29.264
I can't move, Jester's there.

2959
01:49:29.264 --> 01:49:30.562
MATT: You can move through your friends.

2960
01:49:30.562 --> 01:49:32.730
LIAM: Yeah, I'm going to start carefully moving down.

2961
01:49:32.730 --> 01:49:37.730
MATT: All righty, so then five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30.

2962
01:49:38.181 --> 01:49:40.870
Fjord's in the way, but you can stay,

2963
01:49:40.870 --> 01:49:43.109
essentially, right behind him.

2964
01:49:43.109 --> 01:49:44.635
There you go.

2965
01:49:44.635 --> 01:49:47.350
That ends your go, Caleb.

2966
01:49:47.350 --> 01:49:50.241
That makes it to Nott and then Caduceus.

2967
01:49:50.241 --> 01:49:51.712
TALIESIN: You go first.
SAM: I will move

2968
01:49:51.712 --> 01:49:54.962
my 35 feet of speed.
MATT: Five, teen, 15, 25.

2969
01:49:56.430 --> 01:49:59.871
You get between Caleb and Caduceus.

2970
01:49:59.871 --> 01:50:01.119
That's your move.

2971
01:50:01.119 --> 01:50:02.061
You still have your action and bonus.

2972
01:50:02.061 --> 01:50:06.403
SAM: My bonus action to dash another 35 feet.

2973
01:50:07.317 --> 01:50:09.531
MATT: 30, 35, so you're about here.

2974
01:50:09.531 --> 01:50:13.531
SAM: I will hold my action with a crossbow bolt

2975
01:50:15.806 --> 01:50:18.506
if I see another one of those fellers.

2976
01:50:18.506 --> 01:50:20.118
MATT: You've got it. That finishes your turn.

2977
01:50:20.118 --> 01:50:21.748
LIAM: Does that hourglass mean we're all dead?

2978
01:50:21.748 --> 01:50:24.279
MATT: The hourglass has expired now.

2979
01:50:24.279 --> 01:50:26.069
SAM: Oh god.

2980
01:50:26.069 --> 01:50:30.346
MATT: That hum gets (louder humming).

2981
01:50:30.346 --> 01:50:31.179
(crackling)

2982
01:50:32.092 --> 01:50:34.616
You watch as, below, in that open space,

2983
01:50:34.616 --> 01:50:39.137
this blue crackle emerges and the entire mist

2984
01:50:39.137 --> 01:50:41.364
is temporarily electrified in the entire chamber.

2985
01:50:41.364 --> 01:50:43.186
I need everybody to make a dexterity saving throw.

2986
01:50:43.186 --> 01:50:45.444
(groaning)

2987
01:50:48.550 --> 01:50:49.383
TRAVIS: Seven.

2988
01:50:55.340 --> 01:50:56.647
MATT: Ten points of lightning damage.

2989
01:50:56.647 --> 01:50:59.163
TRAVIS: Ten points of lightning damage.

2990
01:50:59.163 --> 01:51:00.154
MARISHA: 12.

2991
01:51:00.154 --> 01:51:01.315
MATT: Ten points of lightning damage.

2992
01:51:01.315 --> 01:51:03.788
MARISHA: Can I evasion half?
MATT: Half damage, five.

2993
01:51:03.788 --> 01:51:04.621
LIAM: 16.

2994
01:51:04.621 --> 01:51:07.305
MATT: 16. Five points of lightning damage.

2995
01:51:07.305 --> 01:51:08.805
SAM: 21 plus evasion.

2996
01:51:09.681 --> 01:51:11.195
MATT: No damage.

2997
01:51:11.195 --> 01:51:12.028
LAURA: 11.

2998
01:51:12.028 --> 01:51:14.363
MATT: Ten points of lightning damage.

2999
01:51:14.363 --> 01:51:15.288
TALIESIN: 15.

3000
01:51:15.288 --> 01:51:17.868
MATT: 15. Five points of lightning damage.

3001
01:51:17.868 --> 01:51:20.289
ASHLEY: Okay, so I have advantage on dex

3002
01:51:20.289 --> 01:51:21.842
against effects that you can see--

3003
01:51:21.842 --> 01:51:23.805
MATT: You have no idea this was coming, so you do not.

3004
01:51:23.805 --> 01:51:25.353
ASHLEY: So I don't know this, okay, so 14.

3005
01:51:25.353 --> 01:51:28.020
MATT: 14. You take five points of lightning damage.

3006
01:51:31.867 --> 01:51:35.202
All right. So Nott, that finishes your turn.

3007
01:51:35.202 --> 01:51:36.439
Caduceus, what are you doing?

3008
01:51:36.439 --> 01:51:39.603
TALIESIN: I'm going to

3009
01:51:39.603 --> 01:51:41.858
head down full speed.

3010
01:51:41.858 --> 01:51:45.172
I'm doing 60 feet.
MATT: All right.

3011
01:51:45.172 --> 01:51:46.922
So with that in tow.

3012
01:51:51.505 --> 01:51:52.880
25, 30.

3013
01:51:55.782 --> 01:51:57.949
That gets you about there.

3014
01:52:01.769 --> 01:52:03.468
ASHLEY: Oh, man.
MATT: In a precarious stage.

3015
01:52:03.468 --> 01:52:06.157
I appreciate your patience for me fiddling with all this.

3016
01:52:06.157 --> 01:52:06.990
All right.

3017
01:52:06.990 --> 01:52:09.010
That finishes Caduceus' go.

3018
01:52:09.010 --> 01:52:10.090
Fjord, what are you doing?

3019
01:52:10.090 --> 01:52:11.852
TRAVIS: Yes, double dash, 60 feet down.

3020
01:52:11.852 --> 01:52:14.586
MATT: All righty, double dash down there.

3021
01:52:14.586 --> 01:52:16.336
That's 30 plus 30.

3022
01:52:20.235 --> 01:52:21.108
At the same movement speed,

3023
01:52:21.108 --> 01:52:22.658
you'd be about there from where Caduceus is,

3024
01:52:22.658 --> 01:52:24.623
so you can barely see Yasha's shape

3025
01:52:24.623 --> 01:52:29.302
as you push past Caduceus, push past Nott.

3026
01:52:29.302 --> 01:52:31.391
That brings us to Jester.
LAURA: Okay.

3027
01:52:31.391 --> 01:52:34.474
I'm going to take off running like everybody else

3028
01:52:34.474 --> 01:52:36.599
and head on down.
TRAVIS: 60 feet?

3029
01:52:36.599 --> 01:52:38.732
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

3030
01:52:38.732 --> 01:52:42.920
MATT: You're right next to-- you almost bump into Nott

3031
01:52:42.920 --> 01:52:44.912
and stop and that's your full movement there.

3032
01:52:46.391 --> 01:52:48.220
We'll just put him there.

3033
01:52:48.220 --> 01:52:49.378
Top of the round.

3034
01:52:49.378 --> 01:52:50.378
Yasha, Beau.

3035
01:52:52.426 --> 01:52:55.499
MARISHA: I'm going to move again, 45.

3036
01:52:55.499 --> 01:52:56.416
Keep going.

3037
01:52:58.324 --> 01:52:59.157
MATT: 35.

3038
01:53:01.176 --> 01:53:03.719
MARISHA: Clear this next chamber.

3039
01:53:03.719 --> 01:53:05.804
MATT: 40, your speed is 45?
MARISHA: 45.

3040
01:53:05.804 --> 01:53:10.054
MATT: You'd be-- yeah, you'd be already down to here.

3041
01:53:13.848 --> 01:53:17.958
MARISHA: Can I peek down and see towards the bottom?

3042
01:53:17.958 --> 01:53:18.961
MATT: You can make an action to try and perceive

3043
01:53:18.961 --> 01:53:21.241
through the very dense fog, if you'd like.

3044
01:53:21.241 --> 01:53:23.016
TRAVIS: Do it. You've got the goggles, right?

3045
01:53:23.016 --> 01:53:25.621
60 feet?
MARISHA: I do. I'll try.

3046
01:53:25.621 --> 01:53:27.067
MATT: Perception check, disadvantage.

3047
01:53:27.067 --> 01:53:29.414
MARISHA: Disadvantage.
MATT: Correct.

3048
01:53:29.414 --> 01:53:32.771
MARISHA: Okay, I'll take that 13 for 16 total.

3049
01:53:32.771 --> 01:53:35.233
MATT: 16, you glance down over the side and look

3050
01:53:35.233 --> 01:53:39.108
and you see, about 25 or so feet down,

3051
01:53:39.108 --> 01:53:43.211
there's a slight blueish, purple

3052
01:53:43.211 --> 01:53:46.711
just a gathering glow. That's all you see.

3053
01:53:48.477 --> 01:53:49.866
SAM: Where'd you find?

3054
01:53:49.866 --> 01:53:51.379
MATT: That's your movement. That's your action.

3055
01:53:51.379 --> 01:53:52.546
MARISHA: I jump down.

3056
01:53:54.563 --> 01:53:56.899
TRAVIS: Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit.

3057
01:53:56.899 --> 01:54:01.899
MATT: You leap down (whooshes) to the mist.

3058
01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:03.744
MARISHA: Slow Fall.
MATT: Right.

3059
01:54:03.744 --> 01:54:07.184
MARISHA: Just glide down the wall, monk-style.

3060
01:54:07.184 --> 01:54:08.973
MATT: Okay, so you go down best you can.

3061
01:54:08.973 --> 01:54:11.335
All right, slow fall, slow fall.

3062
01:54:11.335 --> 01:54:15.176
You drop down to-- there would be a 40-foot fall.

3063
01:54:15.176 --> 01:54:17.018
Slow Fall reduces that by how much?

3064
01:54:17.018 --> 01:54:20.217
MARISHA: It's five times my monk level,

3065
01:54:20.217 --> 01:54:23.187
which is nine, so 18.

3066
01:54:23.187 --> 01:54:25.008
Right?
TRAVIS: 45.

3067
01:54:25.008 --> 01:54:27.558
MARISHA: 45!
MATT: So yeah, so.

3068
01:54:28.909 --> 01:54:33.475
You land to find.

3069
01:54:33.475 --> 01:54:36.171
MARISHA: Sorry, I was doubling.

3070
01:54:36.171 --> 01:54:39.288
I know multiplication works.
MATT: As you impact (whooshes)

3071
01:54:39.288 --> 01:54:40.697
onto the ground and you see this large tower

3072
01:54:40.697 --> 01:54:44.345
in the center that's made of gold and brass and silver

3073
01:54:44.345 --> 01:54:45.941
and it all arcs and spirals upward

3074
01:54:45.941 --> 01:54:49.333
and you see this blue crystal that's at the very top of it

3075
01:54:49.333 --> 01:54:51.293
that is currently (whirring). By the way,

3076
01:54:51.293 --> 01:54:53.748
as you're down there, all the moisture around you

3077
01:54:53.748 --> 01:54:56.387
is starting to vibrate and hum.

3078
01:54:56.387 --> 01:54:58.137
MARISHA: Shit! Shit.

3079
01:54:58.137 --> 01:54:59.678
MATT: That's your bonus action.

3080
01:54:59.678 --> 01:55:01.728
Was all you have left.
MARISHA: That's all I have.

3081
01:55:01.728 --> 01:55:02.588
That's all I have.
MATT: No, no.

3082
01:55:02.588 --> 01:55:03.558
That was your movement, so you landed,

3083
01:55:03.558 --> 01:55:05.351
and you feel down there, you still have some

3084
01:55:05.351 --> 01:55:06.640
movement if you wanted to.

3085
01:55:06.640 --> 01:55:09.235
MARISHA: Oh, oh, this door. What's with this door?

3086
01:55:09.235 --> 01:55:10.889
MATT: You glance behind you and you see

3087
01:55:10.889 --> 01:55:12.619
a door made of a similar material

3088
01:55:12.619 --> 01:55:15.163
as to that tower right there.

3089
01:55:15.163 --> 01:55:17.095
MARISHA: Do I have enough to jiggy it?

3090
01:55:17.095 --> 01:55:17.960
Jiggy the lock?

3091
01:55:17.960 --> 01:55:21.007
MATT: You look over and there's no handle for it.

3092
01:55:21.007 --> 01:55:23.216
You do see what looks to be--

3093
01:55:23.216 --> 01:55:24.847
it's the shapes of the metal ingrained in it,

3094
01:55:24.847 --> 01:55:26.204
but you glance behind.

3095
01:55:26.204 --> 01:55:28.566
That's all you can make out with this turn. That's it.

3096
01:55:28.566 --> 01:55:29.913
That ends your turn, Beau. Yasha, what are you doing?

3097
01:55:29.913 --> 01:55:31.463
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm taking my full movement,

3098
01:55:31.463 --> 01:55:32.779
so 40 feet plus a dash,

3099
01:55:32.779 --> 01:55:34.862
an extra 40.
MATT: All righty.

3100
01:55:36.472 --> 01:55:40.214
35, 40 is your speed, right?

3101
01:55:40.214 --> 01:55:42.984
15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40.

3102
01:55:42.984 --> 01:55:45.798
You'd be over here now.
ASHLEY: (frustrated noise)

3103
01:55:45.798 --> 01:55:48.337
MATT: That's your turn there.
ASHLEY: Okay.

3104
01:55:48.337 --> 01:55:49.679
MATT: All right, that finishes your go.

3105
01:55:53.505 --> 01:55:54.546
TALIESIN: Yep.

3106
01:55:55.676 --> 01:55:58.343
MATT: The creature that's been stalking through the mist

3107
01:55:58.343 --> 01:56:01.397
emerges and swings out, one attack towards Nott,

3108
01:56:01.397 --> 01:56:04.172
one attack towards Jester.

3109
01:56:04.172 --> 01:56:06.308
Jester, it rolled a natural two.

3110
01:56:06.308 --> 01:56:07.724
LAURA: Yeah!
MATT: The second one's

3111
01:56:07.724 --> 01:56:09.426
going to go after Nott.

3112
01:56:09.426 --> 01:56:11.864
SAM: I have already fired at it with my held action.

3113
01:56:11.864 --> 01:56:13.569
MATT: Yes, as it emerges from the mist after you.

3114
01:56:13.569 --> 01:56:14.402
SAM: Ooh, 13.

3115
01:56:15.344 --> 01:56:17.731
MATT: 13 does not hit, unfortunately.

3116
01:56:17.731 --> 01:56:20.204
It attacks you with a 20.
SAM: That hits.

3117
01:56:20.204 --> 01:56:24.613
MATT: All right, you suffer, ooh, that's

3118
01:56:25.785 --> 01:56:27.319
14 points of bludgeoning damage

3119
01:56:27.319 --> 01:56:30.759
as the condensed wind or whatever makes up its body

3120
01:56:30.759 --> 01:56:32.570
just whacks, slams you against the wall

3121
01:56:32.570 --> 01:56:34.311
and cracks your shoulder a little bit.

3122
01:56:34.311 --> 01:56:36.340
LAURA: Can I hold on to Nott to make sure she's, oh--

3123
01:56:36.340 --> 01:56:37.963
SAM: I used evasion.

3124
01:56:37.963 --> 01:56:40.034
Is that a reaction or is that a--

3125
01:56:40.034 --> 01:56:41.723
MATT: That's-- evasion--

3126
01:56:41.723 --> 01:56:43.151
SAM: Is that a thing that happens?

3127
01:56:43.151 --> 01:56:45.250
MATT: That's a good question. Well, just in time for that.

3128
01:56:45.250 --> 01:56:47.025
(groaning)

3129
01:56:47.025 --> 01:56:48.289
SAM: Hold on, features and traits--

3130
01:56:48.289 --> 01:56:49.132
MATT: I don't think evasion is a reaction.

3131
01:56:49.132 --> 01:56:51.639
I think it's your--
SAM: It's just an ability.

3132
01:56:51.639 --> 01:56:53.356
MATT: Yeah, it's your Uncanny Dodge that's a reaction.

3133
01:56:53.356 --> 01:56:56.091
SAM: Yeah, so I will use my--

3134
01:56:56.091 --> 01:56:58.059
I will use my Uncanny Dodge on this attack.

3135
01:56:58.059 --> 01:56:59.363
MATT: Go for it, so you reduce that by half.

3136
01:56:59.363 --> 01:57:00.747
SAM: Okay.

3137
01:57:00.747 --> 01:57:01.933
MATT: All righty.

3138
01:57:01.933 --> 01:57:05.059
I need everybody to make a dexterity saving throw.

3139
01:57:05.059 --> 01:57:06.777
Marisha, you make it at disadvantage.

3140
01:57:06.777 --> 01:57:07.610
MARISHA: Okay.

3141
01:57:07.610 --> 01:57:11.074
TRAVIS: Because you point blank.
MARISHA: Yeah.

3142
01:57:11.074 --> 01:57:11.907
Ooh, ooh!

3143
01:57:15.747 --> 01:57:17.330
MATT: Hold on a second.

3144
01:57:20.720 --> 01:57:21.553
Okay.

3145
01:57:22.450 --> 01:57:24.063
TRAVIS: Natural one.
MATT: Natural one.

3146
01:57:24.063 --> 01:57:25.648
14 points of lightning damage.

3147
01:57:25.648 --> 01:57:26.586
MARISHA: 12.

3148
01:57:26.586 --> 01:57:29.118
MATT: Take seven points of lightning damage.

3149
01:57:29.118 --> 01:57:30.643
No, because you have evasion.

3150
01:57:30.643 --> 01:57:32.061
MARISHA: Oh.
LIAM: 21.

3151
01:57:32.061 --> 01:57:34.434
MATT: You take seven points of lightning damage.

3152
01:57:34.434 --> 01:57:35.267
SAM: 16.

3153
01:57:35.267 --> 01:57:36.820
MATT: You take seven points of lightning damage.

3154
01:57:36.820 --> 01:57:37.653
LAURA: 20.

3155
01:57:37.653 --> 01:57:38.909
MATT: Seven points of lightning damage.

3156
01:57:38.909 --> 01:57:39.742
TALIESIN: Ten.

3157
01:57:39.742 --> 01:57:41.487
MATT: You take 14 points of lightning damage.

3158
01:57:41.487 --> 01:57:42.320
ASHLEY: 15.

3159
01:57:42.320 --> 01:57:44.117
MATT: Seven points of lightning damage.

3160
01:57:44.117 --> 01:57:47.200
MARISHA: Oh, gosh.
MATT: (humming dissipating)

3161
01:57:48.068 --> 01:57:50.334
SAM: Oh, boy.
(humming recharging)

3162
01:57:50.334 --> 01:57:52.180
MATT: It's charging up even stronger.

3163
01:57:52.180 --> 01:57:53.198
ASHLEY: This is going to be hard.

3164
01:57:53.198 --> 01:57:55.898
MATT: All right, that brings us to--

3165
01:57:55.898 --> 01:57:57.099
oh, and this is, again, it's going to go ahead

3166
01:57:57.099 --> 01:57:58.710
and vanish into the mist.

3167
01:57:58.710 --> 01:58:00.527
Both you and Nott get attacks of opportunity

3168
01:58:00.527 --> 01:58:02.538
if you want to.

3169
01:58:02.538 --> 01:58:04.100
LAURA: Fuck, fuck, fuck!

3170
01:58:04.100 --> 01:58:05.666
MATT: With disadvantage because this guy's

3171
01:58:05.666 --> 01:58:07.892
invisible, technically.

3172
01:58:07.892 --> 01:58:10.521
SAM: I got a 25 with disadvantage.

3173
01:58:10.521 --> 01:58:12.251
MATT: That hits.
LAURA: I got 13.

3174
01:58:12.251 --> 01:58:14.089
MATT: 13 misses.

3175
01:58:14.089 --> 01:58:16.260
You swing and it's not there.

3176
01:58:16.260 --> 01:58:17.808
You're just hitting mist with your weapon.

3177
01:58:17.808 --> 01:58:19.578
SAM: 11 points of damage.
MATT: 11 points of damage.

3178
01:58:19.578 --> 01:58:20.901
Nice, good to know.

3179
01:58:20.901 --> 01:58:22.188
All right, that finishes its go.

3180
01:58:22.188 --> 01:58:23.199
Caleb, you're up.

3181
01:58:23.199 --> 01:58:25.026
LIAM: I'm booking it, double.

3182
01:58:25.026 --> 01:58:26.109
MATT: All righty.

3183
01:58:31.207 --> 01:58:35.717
You are just behind. You'd be right between Caduceus there.

3184
01:58:35.717 --> 01:58:38.115
LAURA: Slowly just be in the middle of the mist.

3185
01:58:38.115 --> 01:58:40.466
MATT: All righty, that finishes your turn, Caleb.

3186
01:58:40.466 --> 01:58:42.086
Nott, Caduceus, you guys are up.

3187
01:58:42.086 --> 01:58:44.942
SAM: I'm going to do what I did last time.

3188
01:58:44.942 --> 01:58:46.942
35 feet, 35 feet, bonus.

3189
01:58:48.040 --> 01:58:49.123
MATT: Holding it.

3190
01:58:50.463 --> 01:58:51.953
30, 35.

3191
01:58:53.106 --> 01:58:54.256
You're pushed in that space there.

3192
01:58:54.256 --> 01:58:56.967
I'll allow it. It's fine, because you're still rushing.

3193
01:58:56.967 --> 01:59:00.317
15, 20, 25, you'd be down here.

3194
01:59:00.317 --> 01:59:02.148
30, 35, you're right at the cusp of this.

3195
01:59:02.148 --> 01:59:04.148
You move past. Oh god.

3196
01:59:06.196 --> 01:59:08.371
SAM: I will do the same thing. Hold my action

3197
01:59:08.371 --> 01:59:11.004
with the crossbow bolt until I see

3198
01:59:11.004 --> 01:59:12.710
the whites of their mist.

3199
01:59:12.710 --> 01:59:15.388
MATT: You would be here. You just got to the stairs here.

3200
01:59:15.388 --> 01:59:18.184
SAM: Oh, that's not a very far move.

3201
01:59:18.184 --> 01:59:19.864
MATT: Well, you moved twice to move around

3202
01:59:19.864 --> 01:59:23.551
to get to that side and then hold that, so.

3203
01:59:23.551 --> 01:59:24.384
SAM: I've moved--
MATT: No, no.

3204
01:59:24.384 --> 01:59:25.864
You've moved more then. You're right, my apologies.

3205
01:59:25.864 --> 01:59:29.629
You would be here, just about there.

3206
01:59:29.629 --> 01:59:30.622
You're holding your action.

3207
01:59:30.622 --> 01:59:31.721
SAM: Yes.

3208
01:59:31.721 --> 01:59:33.219
MATT: All right, you're done with that. Caduceus?

3209
01:59:33.219 --> 01:59:34.227
TALIESIN: 60 feet.

3210
01:59:34.227 --> 01:59:35.644
That's all I got.

3211
01:59:39.653 --> 01:59:41.117
Somebody's got to break that crystal

3212
01:59:41.117 --> 01:59:44.839
and turn that thing off. I don't know.

3213
01:59:44.839 --> 01:59:47.139
MATT: You should be past Yasha.

3214
01:59:48.278 --> 01:59:49.512
That's right, because it's all about corners.

3215
01:59:49.512 --> 01:59:51.845
You would be about there.

3216
02:00:01.173 --> 02:00:03.769
Technically, technically, Nott.

3217
02:00:03.769 --> 02:00:04.602
SAM: What's up?
MATT: Technically,

3218
02:00:04.602 --> 02:00:06.902
because you would have had to go once and around,

3219
02:00:06.902 --> 02:00:07.985
and you've been not doing a double run,

3220
02:00:07.985 --> 02:00:10.076
you'd be a little bit ahead of Caduceus by ten feet,

3221
02:00:10.076 --> 02:00:12.702
so you would still be on this mark there.

3222
02:00:12.702 --> 02:00:13.535
SAM: Okay.

3223
02:00:17.857 --> 02:00:18.940
MATT: Double run.

3224
02:00:19.782 --> 02:00:21.079
TALIESIN: You're doing this just to torture us

3225
02:00:21.079 --> 02:00:22.952
for how long it takes to do everything with--

3226
02:00:22.952 --> 02:00:24.330
MATT: Yep, I know.
TALIESIN: Bloody thing!

3227
02:00:24.330 --> 02:00:26.930
MATT: Fjord, you're up.

3228
02:00:26.930 --> 02:00:30.033
TRAVIS: Can I look over the side of the stairway

3229
02:00:30.033 --> 02:00:33.506
and say: Beau, if you can hear me, grab some wall!

3230
02:00:33.506 --> 02:00:35.353
And I'll shoot two Eldritch Blasts

3231
02:00:35.353 --> 02:00:37.731
just straight down the tunnel, trying to illuminate

3232
02:00:37.731 --> 02:00:40.271
the smoke and see how far down this thing goes.

3233
02:00:40.271 --> 02:00:41.814
MATT: Okay, roll for attack, disadvantage each time,

3234
02:00:41.814 --> 02:00:43.016
as you're just shooting towards a glow.

3235
02:00:43.016 --> 02:00:44.732
You don't have a specific--

3236
02:00:44.732 --> 02:00:46.361
TRAVIS: Oh, disadvantage. 12--

3237
02:00:46.361 --> 02:00:47.258
MATT: You don't even know where it is.

3238
02:00:47.258 --> 02:00:48.697
You can't see it from here.

3239
02:00:48.697 --> 02:00:50.316
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm just trying to see how deep it goes,

3240
02:00:50.316 --> 02:00:55.044
like if it stops. That's a 21 for the first one.

3241
02:00:55.044 --> 02:00:56.767
MATT: With disadvantage?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3242
02:00:56.767 --> 02:00:58.247
MATT: Nice.
TRAVIS: Another one

3243
02:00:58.247 --> 02:01:00.730
was a natural 20 and that one is only 11.

3244
02:01:00.730 --> 02:01:03.034
MATT: Okay, 11 misses. Roll damage on the first.

3245
02:01:03.034 --> 02:01:04.767
TRAVIS: Oh, it damaged, oh.

3246
02:01:04.767 --> 02:01:07.258
MATT: It hit something.

3247
02:01:10.117 --> 02:01:12.886
TRAVIS: Seven points of force damage.

3248
02:01:12.886 --> 02:01:15.157
MATT: Okay, let me write that down.

3249
02:01:15.157 --> 02:01:19.180
Okay, Beau, you watch as it hits the top (whooshes)

3250
02:01:19.180 --> 02:01:21.912
and just vanishes into this crystal.

3251
02:01:21.912 --> 02:01:25.068
The crystal is now even further intensified.

3252
02:01:25.068 --> 02:01:28.045
TRAVIS: Did the light stop at some point?

3253
02:01:28.045 --> 02:01:29.448
MATT: You just watched it vanish into the mist.

3254
02:01:29.448 --> 02:01:31.430
You don't know. You just fired it down there.

3255
02:01:31.430 --> 02:01:33.241
All right.
TRAVIS: I still have a movement.

3256
02:01:33.241 --> 02:01:35.028
MATT: You do.
TRAVIS: A bonus action.

3257
02:01:35.028 --> 02:01:37.403
I'm going to--

3258
02:01:38.744 --> 02:01:40.536
yeah, I'm going to step off of the stairs

3259
02:01:40.536 --> 02:01:41.992
and jump down the middle,

3260
02:01:41.992 --> 02:01:43.244
and I'm going to try

3261
02:01:43.244 --> 02:01:45.731
and wait until I see something and hold

3262
02:01:45.731 --> 02:01:47.679
Misty Step with my bonus action.

3263
02:01:47.679 --> 02:01:48.871
MATT: Okay.

3264
02:01:48.871 --> 02:01:52.954
(whooshes) You begin plummeting.

3265
02:01:53.889 --> 02:01:55.915
You only fall 60 feet a round,

3266
02:01:55.915 --> 02:02:00.905
so at the full falling speed, I'd say you get about here.

3267
02:02:00.905 --> 02:02:02.656
What's your passive perception?

3268
02:02:02.656 --> 02:02:04.684
TRAVIS: It's not great, it is

3269
02:02:04.684 --> 02:02:05.517
12.
MATT: All right.

3270
02:02:05.517 --> 02:02:07.792
You do not see anything yet.
TRAVIS: Okay.

3271
02:02:07.792 --> 02:02:09.391
Yeah, the plan is to hold it until I see something

3272
02:02:09.391 --> 02:02:10.936
and then I would Misty Step to the wall.

3273
02:02:10.936 --> 02:02:13.423
MATT: You are currently plummeting at that point there.

3274
02:02:13.423 --> 02:02:14.256
TRAVIS: Okay.

3275
02:02:15.406 --> 02:02:17.830
MATT: You're falling in a free fall at this point.

3276
02:02:17.830 --> 02:02:19.459
(laughs)

3277
02:02:19.459 --> 02:02:20.292
Good to know.

3278
02:02:20.292 --> 02:02:22.687
All right, that brings us to Jester.

3279
02:02:22.687 --> 02:02:27.687
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to Polymorph

3280
02:02:27.730 --> 02:02:29.463
into a giant eagle.

3281
02:02:34.036 --> 02:02:35.316
I'm going to dive down.

3282
02:02:35.316 --> 02:02:38.111
SAM: Whoa, that is a huge bird.
MATT: The fly speed on that is--

3283
02:02:38.111 --> 02:02:39.267
LAURA and MATT: 80.

3284
02:02:39.267 --> 02:02:40.297
SAM: Whoa.

3285
02:02:40.297 --> 02:02:43.419
MATT: You fly, moving right past Fjord.

3286
02:02:43.419 --> 02:02:45.329
LAURA: Do I see him?
TRAVIS: It's a roc!

3287
02:02:45.329 --> 02:02:48.602
MATT: You come right next to Fjord.

3288
02:02:48.602 --> 02:02:50.171
Do you stay or do you keep going?

3289
02:02:50.171 --> 02:02:54.173
LAURA: I'm going to get-- oh god,

3290
02:02:54.173 --> 02:02:56.382
would that get me all the way to the bottom?

3291
02:02:56.382 --> 02:02:57.906
MATT: 80 feet, not all the way to the bottom.

3292
02:02:57.906 --> 02:03:00.196
LAURA: As soon as I know I'm coming to the end,

3293
02:03:00.196 --> 02:03:04.842
I would go to the wall and I would go and land on the steps.

3294
02:03:04.842 --> 02:03:06.361
I'm not going to hang out in the middle.

3295
02:03:06.361 --> 02:03:08.991
I'm going to go land against the wall.

3296
02:03:08.991 --> 02:03:11.085
LIAM: Massive bird person steps.

3297
02:03:11.085 --> 02:03:12.891
TRAVIS: No!
MATT: On the steps.

3298
02:03:12.891 --> 02:03:15.117
Fjord, you're falling past.

3299
02:03:15.117 --> 02:03:16.854
TRAVIS: Goddamn wildlife!
MATT: At this point,

3300
02:03:16.854 --> 02:03:20.360
(whooshing) the arc energy comes shooting up

3301
02:03:20.360 --> 02:03:21.354
through the mist. I need everyone

3302
02:03:21.354 --> 02:03:22.592
to make another dexterity saving throw.

3303
02:03:22.592 --> 02:03:24.078
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

3304
02:03:24.078 --> 02:03:26.022
MATT: Disadvantage for you.

3305
02:03:26.022 --> 02:03:28.729
Actually, disadvantage for both Fjord and Beauregard.

3306
02:03:28.729 --> 02:03:30.154
MARISHA: That was a natural one, so.

3307
02:03:30.154 --> 02:03:33.650
TRAVIS: These are dexterity saving throws, right?
MATT: Correct.

3308
02:03:33.650 --> 02:03:35.067
TALIESIN: Oh, for fuck's!

3309
02:03:36.681 --> 02:03:40.245
MATT: Okay, hold on, so that's 15 plus the seven

3310
02:03:40.245 --> 02:03:42.927
damage that it absorbed from the Eldritch Blast.

3311
02:03:42.927 --> 02:03:46.262
That's a 22.
TRAVIS: That it absorbed from it?

3312
02:03:46.262 --> 02:03:47.908
MATT: Yes.
TRAVIS: 22 points.

3313
02:03:47.908 --> 02:03:49.754
MATT: 22 points of lightning damage.

3314
02:03:49.754 --> 02:03:51.277
MARISHA: A natural one.

3315
02:03:51.277 --> 02:03:52.261
MATT: A natural one, so you take

3316
02:03:52.261 --> 02:03:53.555
11 points of lightning damage.

3317
02:03:53.555 --> 02:03:55.129
LIAM: 19.
MATT: 11 points of lightning damage.

3318
02:03:55.129 --> 02:03:57.099
SAM: 17.
MATT: 11 points of lightning damage.

3319
02:03:57.099 --> 02:03:59.037
LAURA: 21.
MATT: 11 points of lightning damage.

3320
02:03:59.037 --> 02:04:01.187
TALIESIN: Three.
MATT: 22 points of lightning damage.

3321
02:04:02.340 --> 02:04:03.298
ASHLEY: 12.

3322
02:04:03.298 --> 02:04:07.029
MATT: That would be 11 points of lightning damage.

3323
02:04:07.029 --> 02:04:08.899
MATT: No, 22, 22.

3324
02:04:08.899 --> 02:04:09.799
SAM: Do I get my evasion?

3325
02:04:09.799 --> 02:04:10.890
MATT: 22 points of lightning damage.

3326
02:04:10.890 --> 02:04:12.240
SAM: Did I make my save?

3327
02:04:12.240 --> 02:04:15.626
MATT: You did, so you actually would take none.

3328
02:04:15.626 --> 02:04:18.422
All righty, that finishes Jester's turn.

3329
02:04:18.422 --> 02:04:20.652
We're up at the top, Yasha, Beau.

3330
02:04:20.652 --> 02:04:24.444
MARISHA: (yells)

3331
02:04:24.444 --> 02:04:28.217
I look at the-- can I look at the crystal really quick

3332
02:04:28.217 --> 02:04:30.627
and see if there's a-- can I grab it?

3333
02:04:30.627 --> 02:04:33.443
Can I...?
MATT: It's about seven feet

3334
02:04:33.443 --> 02:04:34.801
up there is the main crystal,

3335
02:04:34.801 --> 02:04:37.022
and all the spirals that are attached to it.

3336
02:04:37.022 --> 02:04:38.396
What are you doing?

3337
02:04:38.396 --> 02:04:40.096
MARISHA: Could I investigate if there's

3338
02:04:40.096 --> 02:04:42.037
any way to dismantle it?

3339
02:04:42.037 --> 02:04:43.611
MATT: Go ahead and make an investigation check.

3340
02:04:43.611 --> 02:04:45.825
Use your action to do so.

3341
02:04:45.825 --> 02:04:47.549
TRAVIS: This is good for you, right?

3342
02:04:47.549 --> 02:04:48.712
MARISHA: Yes.

3343
02:04:48.712 --> 02:04:51.315
Yes, yes, it's a natural 19.

3344
02:04:51.315 --> 02:04:52.335
MATT: All right, you spin around to the side--

3345
02:04:52.335 --> 02:04:54.027
MARISHA: Plus my investigation, which is--

3346
02:04:54.027 --> 02:04:55.480
MATT: Plus?
MARISHA: Plus--

3347
02:04:55.480 --> 02:04:57.568
LAURA: Come on, come on, come on!
MARISHA: Eight, plus six!

3348
02:04:57.568 --> 02:04:58.624
MATT: Plus six, you--
MARISHA: 25!

3349
02:04:58.624 --> 02:04:59.457
MATT: You come around to the side,

3350
02:04:59.457 --> 02:05:00.648
there's nothing on this end, on this wall.

3351
02:05:00.648 --> 02:05:01.574
You come around to the side,

3352
02:05:01.574 --> 02:05:04.215
and you can see there's a small, oval-shaped alcove.

3353
02:05:04.215 --> 02:05:07.010
You glance in and you can see this small,

3354
02:05:07.010 --> 02:05:10.987
blue sparkle. This piece of brass metal

3355
02:05:10.987 --> 02:05:13.112
is dangling in the center of this alcove

3356
02:05:13.112 --> 02:05:14.547
with the little blue sparks on each side

3357
02:05:14.547 --> 02:05:16.193
and it's just held in the center.

3358
02:05:16.193 --> 02:05:17.247
It's about a foot deep and there,

3359
02:05:17.247 --> 02:05:19.162
and you can see the hole goes all the way through.

3360
02:05:19.162 --> 02:05:22.455
There's a hollow tunnel, about that wide,

3361
02:05:22.455 --> 02:05:24.025
from end to end, and there's something in the middle

3362
02:05:24.025 --> 02:05:26.785
that's being held aloft, sparking at both ends.

3363
02:05:26.785 --> 02:05:27.783
That was your action to find it.

3364
02:05:27.783 --> 02:05:29.702
You have your bonus action and your move.

3365
02:05:29.702 --> 02:05:31.285
What are you doing?

3366
02:05:32.671 --> 02:05:35.003
LAURA: Come on, come on, come on!
MARISHA: Can I grab it?

3367
02:05:35.003 --> 02:05:36.391
Can I try and get it?

3368
02:05:36.391 --> 02:05:37.549
MATT: I'll allow it because you're a monk.

3369
02:05:37.549 --> 02:05:41.827
You reach out and try and grab this thing.

3370
02:05:41.827 --> 02:05:44.483
I need you to go ahead and make a strength check.

3371
02:05:44.483 --> 02:05:47.486
TRAVIS: Come on, come on!
LAURA: You can do it.

3372
02:05:47.486 --> 02:05:49.069
TRAVIS: Come on, come on!

3373
02:05:50.018 --> 02:05:52.118
MARISHA: Okay, a check?

3374
02:05:52.118 --> 02:05:53.869
MATT: Yes.

3375
02:05:53.869 --> 02:05:54.938
MARISHA: 17.

3376
02:05:54.938 --> 02:05:57.566
MATT: 17. You reach out and grab it (whooshes).

3377
02:05:57.566 --> 02:06:00.983
First thing's first, you immediately take

3378
02:06:02.738 --> 02:06:05.738
12 points of lightning damage.
MARISHA: That's fine.

3379
02:06:05.738 --> 02:06:07.790
MATT: As your hand touches it and (grunts),

3380
02:06:07.790 --> 02:06:10.840
you wrench it free from the inside and pull it out.

3381
02:06:10.840 --> 02:06:12.817
MARISHA: 12, 12. Thank you, sorry.

3382
02:06:12.817 --> 02:06:13.992
MATT: You pull it out from the center

3383
02:06:13.992 --> 02:06:16.671
and you see sparks of energy spiraling outward

3384
02:06:16.671 --> 02:06:18.933
and immediately, the crystal goes dark.

3385
02:06:18.933 --> 02:06:20.191
ASHLEY: Yes!

3386
02:06:21.889 --> 02:06:24.630
MARISHA: (yells)

3387
02:06:24.630 --> 02:06:26.371
MATT: Yasha, what are you doing?

3388
02:06:26.371 --> 02:06:30.342
ASHLEY: I'm using my full movement to make my way down.

3389
02:06:30.342 --> 02:06:31.984
TRAVIS: (laughs)

3390
02:06:31.984 --> 02:06:33.417
Well, hell.

3391
02:06:33.417 --> 02:06:35.242
ASHLEY: Well, hell.

3392
02:06:37.717 --> 02:06:39.548
MATT: You are right about there.

3393
02:06:39.548 --> 02:06:40.381
ASHLEY: For 80?

3394
02:06:40.381 --> 02:06:42.587
TRAVIS: Yasha, there's a big fucking bird in here!

3395
02:06:42.587 --> 02:06:44.457
MATT: You run down as you see Fjord just (whooshes)

3396
02:06:44.457 --> 02:06:46.654
and a giant eagle lands on the opposite side,

3397
02:06:46.654 --> 02:06:50.668
like precariously balanced, in the moment, on the steps.

3398
02:06:50.668 --> 02:06:54.252
Finishing Yasha's go, you are out of play.

3399
02:06:54.252 --> 02:06:56.425
That brings us to its turn.

3400
02:06:56.425 --> 02:06:59.575
LAURA and SAM: (bird screeches)

3401
02:07:02.977 --> 02:07:05.412
MATT: Has moved along.
LAURA: The mist monster's still here.

3402
02:07:05.412 --> 02:07:06.611
SAM: I fire!

3403
02:07:06.611 --> 02:07:09.311
MATT: Going to go ahead and attempt to strike you twice.

3404
02:07:09.311 --> 02:07:11.039
TRAVIS: You fire?
SAM: I shoot at it.

3405
02:07:11.039 --> 02:07:12.192
MATT: Yes, you do.

3406
02:07:12.192 --> 02:07:14.979
Where you are right now, you cannot see it.

3407
02:07:14.979 --> 02:07:17.312
SAM: Just in front of Caduceus?

3408
02:07:18.678 --> 02:07:19.595
MATT: I'll say.

3409
02:07:21.152 --> 02:07:22.561
SAM: Made a big point about putting me

3410
02:07:22.561 --> 02:07:24.207
ten feet in front of Caduceus.

3411
02:07:24.207 --> 02:07:27.113
MATT: I know, but he's about 20 feet above that area.

3412
02:07:27.113 --> 02:07:28.660
SAM: That's fine, that's fine.
MATT: I'll say,

3413
02:07:28.660 --> 02:07:30.894
I'll say, roll a perception check for me,

3414
02:07:30.894 --> 02:07:32.190
with disadvantage. I'm allowing you free,

3415
02:07:32.190 --> 02:07:35.587
because you'd be focusing on Caleb, storyline-wise.

3416
02:07:35.587 --> 02:07:37.020
SAM: It's nine.
MATT: Nine, you do not see it,

3417
02:07:37.020 --> 02:07:38.205
unfortunately.
SAM: Nein!

3418
02:07:39.747 --> 02:07:43.447
MATT: That's going to be a 14 to hit.

3419
02:07:44.792 --> 02:07:46.849
LIAM: Shield, so the 2nd-level spell slot.

3420
02:07:46.849 --> 02:07:50.054
MATT: All right, and the second one is a 21 to hit.

3421
02:07:50.054 --> 02:07:50.955
LIAM: Hits.

3422
02:07:50.955 --> 02:07:53.511
MATT: Okay, so that second one does still hit.

3423
02:07:53.511 --> 02:07:56.553
It goes ahead and deals

3424
02:07:57.775 --> 02:08:00.085
only seven points of bludgeoning damage to you.

3425
02:08:00.085 --> 02:08:03.150
(booming) It's going to go ahead and

3426
02:08:03.150 --> 02:08:05.631
back away into the mist. It's going to vanish downward.

3427
02:08:05.631 --> 02:08:06.735
TALIESIN: I don't suppose it gets near enough

3428
02:08:06.735 --> 02:08:09.262
for me to have a reaction.
MATT: It does not.

3429
02:08:09.262 --> 02:08:10.692
You do get attack of opportunity against it,

3430
02:08:10.692 --> 02:08:11.525
if you'd like to, Caleb.

3431
02:08:11.525 --> 02:08:12.926
Do you have War Caster as a feat?

3432
02:08:12.926 --> 02:08:13.759
LIAM: Yeah, I do.

3433
02:08:13.759 --> 02:08:16.152
MATT: You can reaction spell cast against it if you want to.

3434
02:08:16.152 --> 02:08:17.924
LIAM: I will throw a Fire Bolt at it.

3435
02:08:17.924 --> 02:08:20.504
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll attack to see if you hit.

3436
02:08:20.504 --> 02:08:23.864
With disadvantage because it is invisible.

3437
02:08:23.864 --> 02:08:24.913
LIAM: Balls.

3438
02:08:24.913 --> 02:08:27.754
(mutters)

3439
02:08:27.754 --> 02:08:28.796
Move, D&amp;D Beyond.

3440
02:08:28.796 --> 02:08:30.595
TRAVIS: Balls, balls, balls.
LIAM: 12.

3441
02:08:30.595 --> 02:08:31.821
MATT: 12 misses.

3442
02:08:31.821 --> 02:08:33.198
You keep seeing, in the mist, suddenly,

3443
02:08:33.198 --> 02:08:35.000
a face (whooshes) appear

3444
02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.437
and you're struck twice and then dissipates.

3445
02:08:37.437 --> 02:08:39.072
It's just like the mist itself is attacking you

3446
02:08:39.072 --> 02:08:39.981
and you don't know where it's going to come

3447
02:08:39.981 --> 02:08:42.637
and then where it goes afterward.

3448
02:08:42.637 --> 02:08:44.855
All right, that finishes its go. Caleb, you're up.

3449
02:08:44.855 --> 02:08:47.661
LIAM: I'm not moving fast enough and I have no idea

3450
02:08:47.661 --> 02:08:50.376
what happened down below, so I pull out a cocoon

3451
02:08:50.376 --> 02:08:52.379
and do what I wanted to do the last time and didn't

3452
02:08:52.379 --> 02:08:55.603
and mimic Jester and there is a second giant eagle

3453
02:08:55.603 --> 02:08:57.910
in the chamber.
MATT: Okay.

3454
02:08:57.910 --> 02:09:01.463
I only have this.
TRAVIS: Badass.

3455
02:09:01.463 --> 02:09:04.424
MATT: All right, and you just go ahead and leap down?

3456
02:09:04.424 --> 02:09:05.555
LAURA: We're two eagles!
LIAM: <i>Ja.</i>

3457
02:09:05.555 --> 02:09:07.175
TALIESIN: Can I get-- okay, never mind.

3458
02:09:07.175 --> 02:09:09.204
MATT: You get to this space here.

3459
02:09:09.204 --> 02:09:11.207
TRAVIS: It's the eagles!

3460
02:09:11.207 --> 02:09:12.949
LAURA: If you jump--
MATT: All right.

3461
02:09:12.949 --> 02:09:15.890
TRAVIS: Fucking Torog!

SAM: ♪ Welcome to the Hotel California ♪

3463
02:09:19.391 --> 02:09:20.224
MATT: Nott.

3464
02:09:21.890 --> 02:09:23.728
SAM: All right (laughs).

3465
02:09:23.728 --> 02:09:26.835
MATT: You watch as this giant eagle, this shape,

3466
02:09:26.835 --> 02:09:29.773
of where Caleb was looking, you see just

3467
02:09:29.773 --> 02:09:31.665
and dive down into the mist--
SAM: Take me with you!

3468
02:09:31.665 --> 02:09:34.248
Okay, forget it. I'll catch up.

3469
02:09:35.349 --> 02:09:36.182
I will--

3470
02:09:37.962 --> 02:09:42.062
I will dash. I will move and dash.

3471
02:09:42.933 --> 02:09:43.933
MATT: All right.

3472
02:09:49.558 --> 02:09:51.570
That gets you there with a movement and dash.

3473
02:09:51.570 --> 02:09:53.182
SAM: How far back is Caduceus from me?

3474
02:09:53.182 --> 02:09:55.112
Like 70 feet back?
MATT: Yeah, he's a way back.

3475
02:09:55.112 --> 02:09:57.503
SAM: You can only move 60 a turn, right?

3476
02:09:57.503 --> 02:09:58.951
TALIESIN: Mm-hm.
SAM: I'll stay put

3477
02:09:58.951 --> 02:10:00.913
and hold my action.
MATT: You got it.

02:10:00.913 --> 02:10:05.913
LIAM: ♪ Welcome to the Hotel Rosohna ♪
SAM: (guitar noises)

3479
02:10:06.261 --> 02:10:07.594
TALIESIN: Yeah, 60 feet.

3480
02:10:09.892 --> 02:10:12.582
I should be 15 feet behind, yeah.

3481
02:10:12.582 --> 02:10:14.323
That's fine.

3482
02:10:14.323 --> 02:10:16.945
MATT: You got it. All right, finishing Caduceus' go.

3483
02:10:16.945 --> 02:10:19.782
Hey, I'm glad you pulled that crystal.

3484
02:10:19.782 --> 02:10:22.779
That would have gotten-- damage increases every round.

3485
02:10:22.779 --> 02:10:24.727
(groaning)
MATT: Yep.

3486
02:10:24.727 --> 02:10:26.749
LIAM: It's carving away.

3487
02:10:26.749 --> 02:10:29.379
MATT: That brings us to Fjord.

3488
02:10:29.379 --> 02:10:34.379
You fall towards the spire crystal (whooshes)

3489
02:10:34.708 --> 02:10:37.129
and you see the point of it

3490
02:10:37.129 --> 02:10:38.371
rocketing towards your torso.

3491
02:10:38.371 --> 02:10:41.223
TRAVIS: I use my Misty Step bonus action to go

3492
02:10:41.223 --> 02:10:43.225
out towards the wall to stop my momentum

3493
02:10:43.225 --> 02:10:45.925
out towards wherever the stairs might be on the right.

3494
02:10:45.925 --> 02:10:49.007
MATT: All right, you appear and fall about--

3495
02:10:49.007 --> 02:10:50.139
we'll say only ten feet.

3496
02:10:50.139 --> 02:10:53.332
Go ahead and make an acrobatics check for me.

3497
02:10:53.332 --> 02:10:54.508
TRAVIS: 17.
MATT: Yeah.

3498
02:10:54.508 --> 02:10:55.782
You manage to take no damage

3499
02:10:55.782 --> 02:10:57.305
as you just catch yourself on the stairs.

3500
02:10:57.305 --> 02:10:59.693
You slip a little bit and stumble down two of them,

3501
02:10:59.693 --> 02:11:01.923
but get yourself back to your feet.

3502
02:11:01.923 --> 02:11:05.393
TRAVIS: On my ass. You didn't see that.

3503
02:11:05.393 --> 02:11:06.560
MATT: You're okay.

3504
02:11:07.513 --> 02:11:08.729
TRAVIS: I'll get up and use the rest of my movement

3505
02:11:08.729 --> 02:11:11.249
to walk down to where Beau is if I can.

3506
02:11:11.249 --> 02:11:13.181
LIAM: We are also in the dark again, by the way,

3507
02:11:13.181 --> 02:11:16.430
because the Driftglobe has been absorbed into my eagle form.

3508
02:11:16.430 --> 02:11:18.363
MATT: That's true.
TALIESIN: Shit.

3509
02:11:18.363 --> 02:11:21.446
MATT: So Beau-- yeah, everyone--

3510
02:11:22.481 --> 02:11:24.643
Caduceus is now up in darkness in the mist.

3511
02:11:24.643 --> 02:11:26.115
Two eagles just ran by.

3512
02:11:26.115 --> 02:11:28.402
Or one eagle ran by. Another shadow went by

3513
02:11:28.402 --> 02:11:29.624
right as the light--
TALIESIN: I don't know

3514
02:11:29.624 --> 02:11:30.604
if I would have taken my full 60

3515
02:11:30.604 --> 02:11:34.354
if I would have been in darkness, I will say.

3516
02:11:35.283 --> 02:11:36.686
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: If you want,

3517
02:11:36.686 --> 02:11:39.176
you can move me 30 back and I have a light source now.

3518
02:11:39.176 --> 02:11:40.683
MATT: Okay, there we go.

3519
02:11:40.683 --> 02:11:42.032
We'll put you there.

3520
02:11:42.032 --> 02:11:43.144
TALIESIN: Split the difference.

3521
02:11:43.144 --> 02:11:44.433
MATT: That's fine.

3522
02:11:44.433 --> 02:11:45.391
TRAVIS: Now that I'm down there,

3523
02:11:45.391 --> 02:11:47.102
can I see the door behind Beau?

3524
02:11:47.102 --> 02:11:48.720
MATT: You can, yeah.

3525
02:11:48.720 --> 02:11:50.661
TRAVIS: Can I go: door?

3526
02:11:50.661 --> 02:11:52.612
MARISHA: (stuttering)
TRAVIS: I'll just

3527
02:11:52.612 --> 02:11:55.456
send two Eldritch Blasts at it.

3528
02:11:55.456 --> 02:11:57.096
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll attack for each.

3529
02:11:57.096 --> 02:11:59.263
TRAVIS: Disadvantage or regular?

3530
02:12:00.292 --> 02:12:01.719
MATT: Down here, it's a door.

3531
02:12:01.719 --> 02:12:02.552
I mean, I'll say disadvantage,

3532
02:12:02.552 --> 02:12:05.620
but we'll see how well you do.

3533
02:12:05.620 --> 02:12:07.268
TRAVIS: 14.

3534
02:12:07.268 --> 02:12:08.101
MATT: 14 hits.

3535
02:12:10.096 --> 02:12:12.759
TRAVIS: (groans) Bastard. 25.

3536
02:12:12.759 --> 02:12:16.676
MATT: 25, okay, both hit. Go ahead and roll damage.

3537
02:12:17.951 --> 02:12:21.363
TRAVIS: 13 points force damage for the first one

3538
02:12:21.363 --> 02:12:23.851
and seven for the second, so 20 total.

3539
02:12:23.851 --> 02:12:26.379
MATT: Okay (booms) the door,

3540
02:12:26.379 --> 02:12:30.159
two tiny little bits of chip appear.

3541
02:12:30.159 --> 02:12:31.255
It's going to take a lot of Eldritch Blasts

3542
02:12:31.255 --> 02:12:34.839
to try and blast through that.

3543
02:12:34.839 --> 02:12:36.268
TRAVIS: There's a door. That's it.

3544
02:12:36.268 --> 02:12:39.381
MATT: All right, ending Fjord's turn, Jester, you're up.

3545
02:12:39.381 --> 02:12:41.647
LAURA: I'm going to look up

3546
02:12:43.039 --> 02:12:47.324
and I don't want to leave anybody behind. I'm afraid.

3547
02:12:47.324 --> 02:12:50.537
Oh, but I can't talk.
SAM: (caws)

3548
02:12:50.537 --> 02:12:53.550
LAURA: I'm going to lift up--
TRAVIS: Oh, but I do, and I'm--

3549
02:12:53.550 --> 02:12:55.458
LAURA: And I'm sorry.

3550
02:12:56.707 --> 02:12:57.691
I'm going to lift up--
MATT: You get partway.

3551
02:12:57.691 --> 02:13:00.916
You get about 20, 25 feet up and then left and right,

3552
02:13:00.916 --> 02:13:02.553
you can see both Nott and Caduceus.

3553
02:13:02.553 --> 02:13:05.235
Nott first and then Caduceus up the spiral.

3554
02:13:05.235 --> 02:13:07.960
LAURA: Can I?
(Sam screams)

3555
02:13:07.960 --> 02:13:09.118
MATT: An eagle comes forward to grab you.

3556
02:13:09.118 --> 02:13:10.726
Nott, what do you do?

3557
02:13:10.726 --> 02:13:14.684
SAM: I know it's her. I'll let her grab me, I guess.

3558
02:13:14.684 --> 02:13:15.813
TALIESIN: I don't know who this is,

3559
02:13:15.813 --> 02:13:17.118
but I'm going to let it happen. It's cool.

3560
02:13:17.118 --> 02:13:18.198
MATT: All right.

3561
02:13:18.198 --> 02:13:22.584
Both Nott and Caduceus are currently--

3562
02:13:22.584 --> 02:13:23.417
TRAVIS: I don't know what this is,

3563
02:13:23.417 --> 02:13:25.330
but I'm going to let it happen.

3564
02:13:25.330 --> 02:13:28.247
LIAM: It's a good philosophy.

3565
02:13:29.101 --> 02:13:30.781
Why not?

3566
02:13:30.781 --> 02:13:32.572
LAURA: Then I'm going to use the rest of my movement

3567
02:13:32.572 --> 02:13:35.174
to fly down with them.

3568
02:13:35.174 --> 02:13:37.457
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: To the bottom.

3569
02:13:37.457 --> 02:13:40.216

LAURA: Yeah.

3570
02:13:40.216 --> 02:13:41.818
(like Yondu) I'm Mary Poppins, y'all.

3571
02:13:41.818 --> 02:13:43.023
MATT: It's a very, very tight space,

3572
02:13:43.023 --> 02:13:46.985
but you manage to loosely land and set them down

3573
02:13:46.985 --> 02:13:49.292
before you have to tuck in.

3574
02:13:49.292 --> 02:13:51.233
All right, that finishes your go, Jester.

3575
02:13:51.233 --> 02:13:52.233
Yasha, Beau.

3576
02:13:54.725 --> 02:13:57.782
MARISHA: I cough up a little blood (coughs).

3577
02:13:57.782 --> 02:13:59.767
MATT: Your hands all-- you know, the glove is fine.

3578
02:13:59.767 --> 02:14:04.146
You actually have a glove that insulates the glove itself.

3579
02:14:04.146 --> 02:14:06.629
The flesh where you had grabbed it, behind the glove,

3580
02:14:06.629 --> 02:14:08.046
like the guy that picked up the graphite

3581
02:14:08.046 --> 02:14:10.399
in Chernobyl.

3582
02:14:10.399 --> 02:14:12.713
You feel the burn on the inside of the palm.

3583
02:14:12.713 --> 02:14:14.056
You're like (groans).

3584
02:14:14.056 --> 02:14:15.761
TRAVIS: Before it falls away like an onion.

3585
02:14:15.761 --> 02:14:18.593
MATT: (groans)

3586
02:14:18.593 --> 02:14:21.222
TRAVIS: Dude, so crazy.

3587
02:14:21.222 --> 02:14:25.722
MARISHA: I turn to the door and I try to open it.

3588
02:14:25.722 --> 02:14:29.370
How do I-- so there's no handle, there's no--

3589
02:14:29.370 --> 02:14:32.203
MATT: You don't see a handle anywhere.

3590
02:14:34.568 --> 02:14:36.017
MARISHA: Can I do an investigation check

3591
02:14:36.017 --> 02:14:38.420
to see if there's any slots, any--

3592
02:14:38.420 --> 02:14:39.471
MATT: Yeah, go for it.

3593
02:14:39.471 --> 02:14:40.475
Make an investigation check for me.

3594
02:14:40.475 --> 02:14:42.650
MARISHA: Keyholes, any--

3595
02:14:44.809 --> 02:14:46.448
Okay.

3596
02:14:46.448 --> 02:14:47.623
20 total.
MATT: 22.

3597
02:14:47.623 --> 02:14:48.999
As you--
MARISHA: 20 total.

3598
02:14:48.999 --> 02:14:51.203
MATT: 20 total. As you move your hand across,

3599
02:14:51.203 --> 02:14:53.187
that's all good. Move your hand across, and looking,

3600
02:14:53.187 --> 02:14:55.353
about midway down, you can see where there's

3601
02:14:55.353 --> 02:14:58.081
a bit of-- the brass scrolling and design across it.

3602
02:14:58.081 --> 02:15:00.694
There's a part where it loops into an oval

3603
02:15:00.694 --> 02:15:01.945
and you look and you see there's a spot,

3604
02:15:01.945 --> 02:15:04.595
like a little dark circle there, with a little empty slot.

3605
02:15:04.595 --> 02:15:07.849
MARISHA: Exactly.
(vocalizing)

3606
02:15:07.849 --> 02:15:10.912
MATT: You put it inside and it seems to turn on its own

3607
02:15:10.912 --> 02:15:12.698
and then vanish inside the door.

3608
02:15:12.698 --> 02:15:15.698
It gets pulled in.
TRAVIS: Did you lose it?

3609
02:15:16.974 --> 02:15:19.670
MARISHA: I put it to good use.

3610
02:15:19.670 --> 02:15:20.750
MATT: The door opens, the mist begins

3611
02:15:20.750 --> 02:15:24.867
to escape a little bit into the next chamber.

3612
02:15:24.867 --> 02:15:26.244
I'll say that's your bonus and action.

3613
02:15:26.244 --> 02:15:27.077
MARISHA: Yeah.

3614
02:15:28.202 --> 02:15:29.544
SAM: Good job, Beau.

3615
02:15:29.544 --> 02:15:31.466
ASHLEY: Nice job, Beau.
TALIESIN: Do we want to take a second

3616
02:15:31.466 --> 02:15:32.894
and heal again? That was a lot.

3617
02:15:32.894 --> 02:15:34.106
LAURA: There's a monster in here with us.

3618
02:15:34.106 --> 02:15:35.395
SAM: Well, the mist is dissipating.

3619
02:15:35.395 --> 02:15:37.320
TALIESIN: I don't think there is a monster anymore.

3620
02:15:37.320 --> 02:15:39.530
TRAVIS: It starts to--
MATT: That finishes your turn.

3621
02:15:39.530 --> 02:15:40.969
MARISHA: Yeah, I don't have anything else.

3622
02:15:40.969 --> 02:15:42.962
MATT: You have your movement.

3623
02:15:42.962 --> 02:15:44.537
MARISHA: I'll walk through the door.

3624
02:15:44.537 --> 02:15:45.370
MATT: Okay.

3625
02:15:46.794 --> 02:15:49.658
Beau, you walk through the door into

3626
02:15:49.658 --> 02:15:53.575
a ten-foot chamber to another door that is open,

3627
02:15:55.419 --> 02:15:57.328
or at least you see an archway

3628
02:15:57.328 --> 02:16:00.252
that is open into another room.

3629
02:16:00.252 --> 02:16:05.252
The stonework here is like a dark, dark brown and red,

3630
02:16:05.283 --> 02:16:07.465
like the color shift is notable.

3631
02:16:07.465 --> 02:16:10.375
MARISHA: It's more fucking doors.

3632
02:16:10.375 --> 02:16:12.562
TRAVIS: That's all the description you give?

3633
02:16:12.562 --> 02:16:15.041
MATT: You move from the hallway into the next room?

3634
02:16:15.041 --> 02:16:15.949
MARISHA: I stay there.

3635
02:16:15.949 --> 02:16:17.406
I'm going to wait for people to gather.

3636
02:16:17.406 --> 02:16:19.532
MATT: You got it. All right, Yasha?

3637
02:16:19.532 --> 02:16:21.382
ASHLEY: I'm going to make my way down.

3638
02:16:21.382 --> 02:16:23.058
SAM: ♪ Making my way down ♪

3639
02:16:23.058 --> 02:16:25.557
ASHLEY: ♪ Making my way downtown ♪

3640
02:16:25.557 --> 02:16:28.105
MATT: You move up to the large eagle

3641
02:16:28.105 --> 02:16:31.173
that is there on the woods, or on the steps,

3642
02:16:31.173 --> 02:16:34.090
and you can try and move past it or--

3643
02:16:34.985 --> 02:16:36.542
It's up you to assume it's a friend or not.

3644
02:16:36.542 --> 02:16:38.319
It's just a giant eagle in the middle of a--

3645
02:16:38.319 --> 02:16:40.863
ASHLEY: Do you want to go down?

3646
02:16:40.863 --> 02:16:43.135
LIAM: (cawing)
ASHLEY: Okay.

3647
02:16:43.135 --> 02:16:44.314
I'm just going to keep walking down.

3648
02:16:44.314 --> 02:16:45.818
MATT: Okay.

3649
02:16:45.818 --> 02:16:49.153
That'll get you about there.

3650
02:16:49.153 --> 02:16:51.793
All right, finishes that go.

3651
02:16:51.793 --> 02:16:54.378
LAURA: In my eagle form, I laugh. Ha ha ha.

3652
02:16:54.378 --> 02:16:57.221
TALIESIN and LIAM: (bird noises)

3653
02:16:57.221 --> 02:16:58.631
SAM: Oh, it's back!

3654
02:16:58.631 --> 02:16:59.756
LAURA: Oh no!

3655
02:16:59.756 --> 02:17:02.734
ASHLEY: Wait, was I on the top of that?

3656
02:17:02.734 --> 02:17:03.994
Oh, because we hadn't gone--

3657
02:17:03.994 --> 02:17:05.669
MATT: Yeah, you moved around there.

3658
02:17:05.669 --> 02:17:07.523
It's all good.

3659
02:17:07.523 --> 02:17:10.571
So actually, you are technically up in

3660
02:17:10.571 --> 02:17:13.254
the base of the--
(shouting)

3661
02:17:13.254 --> 02:17:14.137
MATT: Sorry, buddy.

3662
02:17:14.137 --> 02:17:16.762
--the base of the stairs there.

3663
02:17:16.762 --> 02:17:17.787
TALIESIN: This is the most <i>you</i> dungeon

3664
02:17:17.787 --> 02:17:19.506
I've seen in a long time.

3665
02:17:19.506 --> 02:17:20.410
MATT: That's going to go ahead

3666
02:17:20.410 --> 02:17:22.996
and attack your giant eagle twice.

3667
02:17:22.996 --> 02:17:25.088
That's going to be, ooh, 24 to hit?

3668
02:17:25.088 --> 02:17:28.623
LIAM: Yeah, that hits.
MATT: And 21 to hit?

3669
02:17:28.623 --> 02:17:30.400
LIAM: Ja, hits.
SAM: Oh god.

3670
02:17:30.400 --> 02:17:32.983
MATT: You suffer-- that's shitty--

3671
02:17:35.173 --> 02:17:37.089
seven points of bludgeoning damage on the first hit.

3672
02:17:37.089 --> 02:17:39.013
Make a concentration check.

3673
02:17:39.013 --> 02:17:41.112
LIAM: Oh, <i>ja</i>, which I do at advantage--

3674
02:17:41.112 --> 02:17:42.468
MATT: Advantage, because you are a War Caster.

3675
02:17:42.468 --> 02:17:43.301
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

3676
02:17:44.616 --> 02:17:47.616
I get big bonuses, though.
SAM: Big bonus.

3677
02:17:47.616 --> 02:17:49.443
TRAVIS: Yeah, big bonuses!

3678
02:17:49.443 --> 02:17:50.315
LIAM: 13.

3679
02:17:50.315 --> 02:17:51.435
MATT: 13, yep, no problem.

3680
02:17:51.435 --> 02:17:52.328
You manage to maintain that.
LIAM: What was

3681
02:17:52.328 --> 02:17:53.407
the damage on that again, please?

3682
02:17:53.407 --> 02:17:54.486
MATT and SAM: Seven.

3683
02:17:54.486 --> 02:17:55.319
LIAM: Okay.

3684
02:17:55.319 --> 02:17:56.152
MATT: The second attack.

3685
02:17:56.152 --> 02:17:57.485
That's better.

3686
02:18:00.305 --> 02:18:02.150
13 points of bludgeoning damage and

3687
02:18:02.150 --> 02:18:04.567
another check with advantage.

3688
02:18:07.042 --> 02:18:09.075
TALIESIN: Whittle us down.

3689
02:18:09.075 --> 02:18:10.926
LIAM: That's higher than the others.

3690
02:18:10.926 --> 02:18:12.228
MATT: Yeah, so you're fine.

3691
02:18:12.228 --> 02:18:14.205
It's going to then dissipate in the mist.

3692
02:18:14.205 --> 02:18:15.520
TRAVIS: (yells)

3693
02:18:15.520 --> 02:18:17.101
MATT: Every fucking time.
LIAM: Do I get an attack of opportunity?

3694
02:18:17.101 --> 02:18:17.934
MATT: You do.

3695
02:18:19.358 --> 02:18:21.187
TRAVIS: I'm starting to remember this.

3696
02:18:21.187 --> 02:18:24.937
LAURA: (laughs)
LIAM: That's a 15.

3697
02:18:25.941 --> 02:18:26.899
MATT: 15 hits.

3698
02:18:26.899 --> 02:18:30.129
LIAM: I rake my talons across it.

3699
02:18:30.129 --> 02:18:32.470
MATT: Oh, that was a disadvantage on the attack, by the way.

3700
02:18:32.470 --> 02:18:33.303
Because it's invisible.
LIAM: Okay, so then,

3701
02:18:33.303 --> 02:18:36.303
that was a 15 to hit.
MATT: Right.

3702
02:18:36.303 --> 02:18:37.966
So that was 15 with disadvantage.

3703
02:18:37.966 --> 02:18:40.359
LIAM: Yeah, 20. Sorry, I rolled a 15 and a ten,

3704
02:18:40.359 --> 02:18:42.589
so it was a 20 or a 15.
MATT: Yeah, so you're fine.

3705
02:18:42.589 --> 02:18:43.589
Roll damage.

3706
02:18:45.133 --> 02:18:47.359
LIAM: Five, five points.
MATT: Five points of damage.

3707
02:18:47.359 --> 02:18:48.534
You got it.

3708
02:18:48.534 --> 02:18:50.625
TALIESIN: This thing is not dying.

3709
02:18:50.625 --> 02:18:54.232
MATT: All right. That finishes its go. Caleb, you're up.

3710
02:18:54.232 --> 02:18:56.096
LIAM: Well, I was feeling saucy a moment ago,

3711
02:18:56.096 --> 02:19:00.147
but not so much anymore, so I'm going to

3712
02:19:00.147 --> 02:19:04.628
float and try to find open space down below to land.

3713
02:19:04.628 --> 02:19:05.864
MATT: All right.

3714
02:19:05.864 --> 02:19:07.653
TRAVIS: Does their big ass flapping

3715
02:19:07.653 --> 02:19:10.101
accelerate the mist out of the room?

3716
02:19:10.101 --> 02:19:13.293
LAURA: Yeah, that's true.
MATT: A little bit.

3717
02:19:13.293 --> 02:19:15.587
There's a lot of mist in this little chamber.

3718
02:19:15.587 --> 02:19:18.231
It gives it the same space. It's not like a huge push.

3719
02:19:18.231 --> 02:19:19.537
As you rush past, it does get

3720
02:19:19.537 --> 02:19:20.810
an attack of opportunity on you.

3721
02:19:20.810 --> 02:19:22.536
LIAM: Okay.

3722
02:19:22.536 --> 02:19:23.661
MATT: That's going to be a 20 to hit.

3723
02:19:23.661 --> 02:19:25.207
LIAM: Hits.

3724
02:19:25.207 --> 02:19:28.111
MATT: You take 12 points of bludgeoning damage.

3725
02:19:28.111 --> 02:19:30.393
LIAM: Okay, so I revert into a human in midair,

3726
02:19:30.393 --> 02:19:31.835
so you tell me what happens.

3727
02:19:31.835 --> 02:19:35.913
MATT: So as you rush past, the eagle (whooshing),

3728
02:19:35.913 --> 02:19:39.334
you only fall about 20 feet onto the stairs.

3729
02:19:39.334 --> 02:19:41.145
Go ahead and make an acrobatics check.

3730
02:19:41.145 --> 02:19:44.359
LIAM: So just the hit took four off of Caleb.

3731
02:19:44.359 --> 02:19:47.109
Make an acrobatics check?
MATT: Mm-hm.

3732
02:19:48.850 --> 02:19:50.411
LIAM: 14.

3733
02:19:50.411 --> 02:19:51.652
MATT: 14?
LIAM: Yeah--

3734
02:19:51.652 --> 02:19:53.833
MATT: You take 11 points of bludgeoning damage,

3735
02:19:53.833 --> 02:19:55.944
landing on the stairs on your back (crunches).

3736
02:19:55.944 --> 02:19:58.652
SAM: Ow, ow.

3737
02:19:58.652 --> 02:20:00.835
TRAVIS: Shit. Tailbone and everything.

3738
02:20:00.835 --> 02:20:01.933
MATT: There you are.
LIAM: Okay.

3739
02:20:01.933 --> 02:20:03.189
MATT: All right.

3740
02:20:03.189 --> 02:20:05.293
That brings us--
LIAM: Do I still have an action?

3741
02:20:05.293 --> 02:20:06.600
Because I didn't do anything.
MATT: Yeah,

3742
02:20:06.600 --> 02:20:07.896
you still have your action.

3743
02:20:07.896 --> 02:20:10.799
LIAM: I will use, where's the door?

3744
02:20:10.799 --> 02:20:12.216
MATT: The door's right there.

3745
02:20:12.216 --> 02:20:14.836
You can barely even see past the spire.

3746
02:20:14.836 --> 02:20:16.311
You don't even know there's a door there.

3747
02:20:16.311 --> 02:20:17.861
You just fell on like (groans)

3748
02:20:17.861 --> 02:20:19.768
LIAM: Then I will use my action for movement,

3749
02:20:19.768 --> 02:20:22.093
so half of it's just to get to standing and then

3750
02:20:22.093 --> 02:20:23.120
feel my way down through it,

3751
02:20:23.120 --> 02:20:26.234
so I bump into-- Oh, hello, Fjord.

3752
02:20:26.234 --> 02:20:27.639
MATT: You see the open door and you can see

3753
02:20:27.639 --> 02:20:30.084
the shape of Beauregard beyond it,

3754
02:20:30.084 --> 02:20:31.728
about ten feet beyond the door.

3755
02:20:31.728 --> 02:20:32.561
LIAM: That's it.

3756
02:20:32.561 --> 02:20:33.394
MATT: That finishes your go, Caleb.

3757
02:20:33.394 --> 02:20:35.690
Nott and Caduceus.

3758
02:20:35.690 --> 02:20:38.895
TALIESIN: I'm going to head just inside the door

3759
02:20:38.895 --> 02:20:42.424
and then hold my action to fire a bolt

3760
02:20:42.424 --> 02:20:44.845
at that thing the second it shows up again.

3761
02:20:44.845 --> 02:20:47.602
MATT: You stay inside the chamber?

3762
02:20:47.602 --> 02:20:49.833
TALIESIN: Can I get five feet into the chamber

3763
02:20:49.833 --> 02:20:52.124
and just behind the door and look up or--?

3764
02:20:52.124 --> 02:20:52.986
MATT: You can get five feet in the chamber.

3765
02:20:52.986 --> 02:20:54.480
You won't have much of a view

3766
02:20:54.480 --> 02:20:57.730
except for what's just beyond the door.

3767
02:20:59.179 --> 02:21:01.178
TALIESIN: I'm pretty messed up. I'm just going to,

3768
02:21:01.178 --> 02:21:03.827
I'm just going to be five feet in

3769
02:21:03.827 --> 02:21:05.734
and hold an action in case I can see it.

3770
02:21:05.734 --> 02:21:07.093
MATT: Okay, so you turn back towards the door

3771
02:21:07.093 --> 02:21:08.549
and just hold?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3772
02:21:08.549 --> 02:21:09.465
MATT: Hold, what, Sacred Flame?

3773
02:21:09.465 --> 02:21:10.298
TALIESIN: Sacred Flame.

3774
02:21:10.298 --> 02:21:11.131
MATT: Okay, you got it.

3775
02:21:11.131 --> 02:21:12.334
Nott, what are you doing?

3776
02:21:12.334 --> 02:21:14.729
You're still being held by the talon of Jester,

3777
02:21:14.729 --> 02:21:16.714
but she's landed and is releasing you, so.

3778
02:21:16.714 --> 02:21:17.663
SAM: Oh, she's releasing?
LAURA: You can let go.

3779
02:21:17.663 --> 02:21:18.496
I can let go.

3780
02:21:18.496 --> 02:21:19.679
SAM: I'm going to make my way downtown

3781
02:21:19.679 --> 02:21:20.912
into the next chamber.

3782
02:21:20.912 --> 02:21:22.871
MATT: All right, you move in.

3783
02:21:22.871 --> 02:21:26.336
Do you move past Beauregard or up against her?

3784
02:21:26.336 --> 02:21:28.622
SAM: Just up to where she is.
MATT: Okay.

3785
02:21:28.622 --> 02:21:32.141
You're about side to side with Beauregard.

3786
02:21:32.141 --> 02:21:33.745
Easy enough, it takes 30 feet of movement

3787
02:21:33.745 --> 02:21:35.592
to get around there.

3788
02:21:35.592 --> 02:21:36.993
Where she is, now you walk up to the edge,

3789
02:21:36.993 --> 02:21:38.474
the mist is dissipating

3790
02:21:38.474 --> 02:21:39.528
and you see that this archway

3791
02:21:39.528 --> 02:21:44.528
that leads into another chamber with dark brown, red stone.

3792
02:21:44.548 --> 02:21:46.341
There's no light in there, but you have darkvision.

3793
02:21:46.341 --> 02:21:47.669
TALIESIN: I have a light on.
MATT: Oh, that's right.

3794
02:21:47.669 --> 02:21:49.396
You have a light in there as well.

3795
02:21:49.396 --> 02:21:50.659
So looking inside, past that.

3796
02:21:50.659 --> 02:21:52.130
The light, by the way, which you cast,

3797
02:21:52.130 --> 02:21:54.114
still diminished. It's like the radius of it

3798
02:21:54.114 --> 02:21:56.637
and the strength of it is halved

3799
02:21:56.637 --> 02:21:58.635
in wherever you are at the moment.

3800
02:21:58.635 --> 02:21:59.476
LIAM: I have a question as well.

3801
02:21:59.476 --> 02:22:02.142
The Driftglobe obviously gets, you know,

3802
02:22:02.142 --> 02:22:03.725
pulled into Caleb when he turns into something.

3803
02:22:03.725 --> 02:22:05.955
Does it come back out if it was out when he--

3804
02:22:05.955 --> 02:22:06.921
MATT: It does.

3805
02:22:06.921 --> 02:22:07.754
It's back in your hand.
LIAM: The Driftglobe is

3806
02:22:07.754 --> 02:22:09.377
lighting the cave--
MATT: And Driftglobe,

3807
02:22:09.377 --> 02:22:10.721
its daylight still diminished by half.

3808
02:22:10.721 --> 02:22:11.657
LIAM: Sure, sure, sure.

3809
02:22:11.657 --> 02:22:14.584
MATT: It seems like all light sources are

3810
02:22:14.584 --> 02:22:16.492
drastically reduced--
SAM: Does that effect

3811
02:22:16.492 --> 02:22:18.601
darkvisioned creatures as well?

3812
02:22:18.601 --> 02:22:20.332
Like can we see half as far?

3813
02:22:20.332 --> 02:22:22.685
MATT: It does effect darkvision a bit, too.

3814
02:22:22.685 --> 02:22:27.060
There's a general

3815
02:22:27.060 --> 02:22:29.419
gathering of shadows in this space,

3816
02:22:29.419 --> 02:22:31.350
unlike other places you've been.

3817
02:22:31.350 --> 02:22:33.979
SAM: Just another point of clarification for earlier.

3818
02:22:33.979 --> 02:22:35.812
Do goblins have tails?

3819
02:22:36.873 --> 02:22:39.900
MATT: Generally, no, but--
SAM: Okay, didn't know.

3820
02:22:39.900 --> 02:22:40.774
MATT: Unless you really wanted one.

3821
02:22:40.774 --> 02:22:43.176
SAM: No, no, I just never thought about it before today.

3822
02:22:43.176 --> 02:22:44.997
MATT: (laughs)

3823
02:22:44.997 --> 02:22:49.081
SAM: I'll spend my action to turn to Beau and say:

3824
02:22:49.081 --> 02:22:52.259
Did you take my flask?
(laughter)

3825
02:22:52.259 --> 02:22:53.304
Do you have my flask?

3826
02:22:53.304 --> 02:22:54.137
MARISHA: I did not, but why do you

3827
02:22:54.137 --> 02:22:55.303
have your hands on your butt?

3828
02:22:57.026 --> 02:23:00.089
SAM: I'm searching everywhere.

3829
02:23:00.089 --> 02:23:01.524
MARISHA: No, I didn't. I'm sorry.

3830
02:23:01.524 --> 02:23:03.335
SAM: All right.
MARISHA: I would tell you

3831
02:23:03.335 --> 02:23:05.212
if I stole something.
SAM: That's true, you would.

3832
02:23:05.212 --> 02:23:06.487
MARISHA: I would brag about it.
SAM: Yes, you would.

3833
02:23:06.487 --> 02:23:07.320
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: Yep.

3834
02:23:07.320 --> 02:23:09.049
MATT: Fjord, you're up.

3835
02:23:09.049 --> 02:23:13.716
TRAVIS: I'll move through the-- yep, through the doorway.

3836
02:23:14.579 --> 02:23:17.391
MATT: 25 gets you right in front of Jester and Nott

3837
02:23:17.391 --> 02:23:19.056
and you have a view of the chamber beyond.

3838
02:23:19.056 --> 02:23:22.841
TRAVIS: With my half of my 60 darkvision, do I see anything?

3839
02:23:22.841 --> 02:23:26.659
MATT: Yeah, you look inside and you can see this chamber.

3840
02:23:26.659 --> 02:23:30.159
It opens a little octagonally, like beyond the door,

3841
02:23:30.159 --> 02:23:32.510
the walls open a bit and then flatten out.

3842
02:23:32.510 --> 02:23:35.511
You can see chains hanging from the wall on each side.

3843
02:23:35.511 --> 02:23:37.334
Looks like there's a little rack

3844
02:23:37.334 --> 02:23:39.683
right beyond the entranceway.

3845
02:23:39.683 --> 02:23:41.374
There's something--
SAM: Big rack over here.

3846
02:23:41.374 --> 02:23:42.207
MATT: There you go.

3847
02:23:42.207 --> 02:23:45.754
There's some sort of a central pillar

3848
02:23:45.754 --> 02:23:47.444
in the center of the room. It's about two feet,

3849
02:23:47.444 --> 02:23:49.969
two-and-a-half feet tall.

3850
02:23:49.969 --> 02:23:51.448
Looks almost like a bird bath

3851
02:23:51.448 --> 02:23:53.495
is the best way I can describe it.

3852
02:23:53.495 --> 02:23:54.932
Then on each side of the room,

3853
02:23:54.932 --> 02:23:56.878
you can see these two slopes

3854
02:23:56.878 --> 02:23:58.276
that disappear out of view,

3855
02:23:58.276 --> 02:23:59.721
like two sides of the room, there's pits

3856
02:23:59.721 --> 02:24:02.627
that slope down and towards the walls.

3857
02:24:02.627 --> 02:24:04.484
TRAVIS: I'll wait where I am and I'll turn around

3858
02:24:04.484 --> 02:24:06.261
and I'll hold an Eldritch Blast

3859
02:24:06.261 --> 02:24:08.255
like Caduceus is doing back towards the doorway

3860
02:24:08.255 --> 02:24:10.161
in case the thing shows up.
MATT: You got it.

3861
02:24:10.161 --> 02:24:11.985
Jester.

3862
02:24:11.985 --> 02:24:14.768
You've landed, you've released your--

3863
02:24:14.768 --> 02:24:16.201
LAURA: What all is in the room still with us?

3864
02:24:16.201 --> 02:24:18.164
I mean, it's just Caleb in here with me.

3865
02:24:18.164 --> 02:24:19.673
MATT: It's Caleb, and Yasha,

3866
02:24:19.673 --> 02:24:21.979
you haven't seen come downstairs yet.

3867
02:24:21.979 --> 02:24:24.511
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to look up.

3868
02:24:24.511 --> 02:24:26.767
Do I see Yasha around anywhere?

3869
02:24:26.767 --> 02:24:28.180
MATT: Make a perception check with disadvantage.

3870
02:24:28.180 --> 02:24:29.477
Although you have perception,

3871
02:24:29.477 --> 02:24:32.142
I think it's a giant eagle, advantage--

3872
02:24:32.142 --> 02:24:34.597
LAURA: Yeah, that's true.
MATT: So it's just a single roll.

3873
02:24:34.597 --> 02:24:37.061
LIAM: There's no darkvision, but we've got light.

3874
02:24:37.061 --> 02:24:40.114
SAM: Whoa, whoa. So many.
MATT: That was a journey.

3875
02:24:40.114 --> 02:24:41.364
LAURA: Yeah, it was.

3876
02:24:42.635 --> 02:24:45.502
What do I add to it, wisdom?

3877
02:24:45.502 --> 02:24:49.289
No, I'm an eagle and I've got to use my eagle stats.

3878
02:24:49.289 --> 02:24:51.045
What is it, my wisdom modifier?

3879
02:24:51.045 --> 02:24:52.111
MATT: Your wisdom modifier or any perception bonus--

3880
02:24:52.111 --> 02:24:55.187
LAURA: Perception modifier plus four, 17.

3881
02:24:55.187 --> 02:24:56.653
SAM: Keen sight has advantage.

3882
02:24:56.653 --> 02:24:57.818
LAURA: I know. I already did that. It's fine.

3883
02:24:57.818 --> 02:25:00.228
MATT: I'd say you can look up and you can just barely see

3884
02:25:00.228 --> 02:25:03.185
the outline of Yasha running down the stairs.

3885
02:25:03.185 --> 02:25:07.793
LAURA: (caws) I fly up and can I grab Yasha then?

3886
02:25:07.793 --> 02:25:09.543
MATT: Sure.
ASHLEY: Yes, please.

3887
02:25:11.932 --> 02:25:14.262
MATT: Go ahead and grab Yasha.
LAURA: I fly down

3888
02:25:14.262 --> 02:25:16.372
and put her on the ground next to Caleb.

3889
02:25:16.372 --> 02:25:19.577
MATT: Okay, easy enough.

3890
02:25:19.577 --> 02:25:20.741
ASHLEY: Thanks, Jessie.

3891
02:25:20.741 --> 02:25:22.236
I think it's Jessie.

3892
02:25:22.236 --> 02:25:25.564
I see blue feathers.
LAURA: Aw.

3893
02:25:25.564 --> 02:25:27.922
MATT: Now you're floating above.

3894
02:25:27.922 --> 02:25:29.982
You set Yasha down. That's your action,

3895
02:25:29.982 --> 02:25:30.815
most of your movement.

3896
02:25:30.815 --> 02:25:32.982
LAURA: Yeah, I guess I'll land.

3897
02:25:33.928 --> 02:25:35.321
I'm going to wait to drop this.

3898
02:25:35.321 --> 02:25:37.356
I'm assuming I can't get through the doorway as this giant--

3899
02:25:37.356 --> 02:25:38.635
MATT: That door is way too small for a giant eagle.

3900
02:25:38.635 --> 02:25:40.266
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to wait until

3901
02:25:40.266 --> 02:25:41.573
I make sure everybody's safe.

3902
02:25:41.573 --> 02:25:43.350
I'm going to try to block everybody

3903
02:25:43.350 --> 02:25:44.908
from whatever that mist creature is.

3904
02:25:44.908 --> 02:25:45.962
MATT: You've got it, all right.

3905
02:25:45.962 --> 02:25:47.866
You make your space as big as possible.

3906
02:25:47.866 --> 02:25:49.511
Wings out.

3907
02:25:49.511 --> 02:25:52.549
That finishes your go. Top of the round, Yasha, Beau.

3908
02:25:52.549 --> 02:25:54.382
Yasha, anything, Beau?

3909
02:25:56.614 --> 02:25:59.651
ASHLEY: Did you say that there were markings on the door?

3910
02:25:59.651 --> 02:26:00.611
MATT: The door is open and you can see--

3911
02:26:00.611 --> 02:26:05.600
it looks like detailed scrolling.

3912
02:26:05.600 --> 02:26:09.134
No real images or symbols.

3913
02:26:09.134 --> 02:26:11.747
It's like beautiful designs put in with

3914
02:26:11.747 --> 02:26:15.122
silver or gold, brass-type materials.

3915
02:26:15.122 --> 02:26:18.478
It matches the pillar that's in the center.

3916
02:26:18.478 --> 02:26:20.037
ASHLEY: Okay.

3917
02:26:20.037 --> 02:26:22.257
MARISHA: It matches the pillar?

3918
02:26:22.257 --> 02:26:24.432
ASHLEY: The pillar that's--

3919
02:26:24.432 --> 02:26:25.850
MATT: Yeah, the crystal is a part of.

3920
02:26:25.850 --> 02:26:27.725
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to make my way inside

3921
02:26:27.725 --> 02:26:29.903
with everybody else.

3922
02:26:29.903 --> 02:26:31.164
MATT: You move in. It's getting a little crowded.

3923
02:26:31.164 --> 02:26:33.216
You can get right next to Caduceus on the inside

3924
02:26:33.216 --> 02:26:35.785
or you can move past and join Fjord.

3925
02:26:35.785 --> 02:26:36.971
ASHLEY: I'll move past and join Fjord.

3926
02:26:36.971 --> 02:26:37.920
MATT: All right, so you're now at the front.

3927
02:26:37.920 --> 02:26:40.108
You can see within the chamber

3928
02:26:40.108 --> 02:26:41.362
exactly what it is that Fjord can see

3929
02:26:41.362 --> 02:26:43.512
as he's looking behind the Eldritch Blast held there.

3930
02:26:43.512 --> 02:26:44.649
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MATT: You got it.

3931
02:26:44.649 --> 02:26:47.479
MARISHA: It's open?
LIAM: You said bird bath?

3932
02:26:47.479 --> 02:26:48.641
Describe it one more time.
MATT: From you,

3933
02:26:48.641 --> 02:26:50.789
there's about ten more feet of hallway

3934
02:26:50.789 --> 02:26:53.620
and then it opens up and, inside the chamber,

3935
02:26:53.620 --> 02:26:54.453
you can see where it evens out.

3936
02:26:54.453 --> 02:26:57.007
There's the two sliding pits that descend

3937
02:26:57.007 --> 02:26:59.020
into the floor and then just

3938
02:26:59.020 --> 02:27:01.411
on the outside of your visual radius,

3939
02:27:01.411 --> 02:27:03.235
within the chamber, you can see a little--

3940
02:27:03.235 --> 02:27:05.176
like a platform, like a birdbath type platform

3941
02:27:05.176 --> 02:27:07.022
that's about two-and-a-half feet off the ground

3942
02:27:07.022 --> 02:27:10.568
and has a top surface like a table it looks like--

3943
02:27:10.568 --> 02:27:13.434
LIAM: A little dais or stone rise that this thing's on?

3944
02:27:13.434 --> 02:27:14.923
MATT: No, it--
LIAM: On the ground--

3945
02:27:14.923 --> 02:27:16.037
MATT: It looks like it's on the ground

3946
02:27:16.037 --> 02:27:18.106
and then on each side of where it stands,

3947
02:27:18.106 --> 02:27:19.407
it looks like part of the ground

3948
02:27:19.407 --> 02:27:24.039
turns into a slope that goes beneath the ground.

3949
02:27:24.039 --> 02:27:26.922
MARISHA: I move forward as well.

3950
02:27:26.922 --> 02:27:28.380
MATT: Into the chamber or?

3951
02:27:28.380 --> 02:27:31.411
MARISHA: I go in the chamber.

3952
02:27:31.411 --> 02:27:36.326
I stealthily start making my way into the chamber.

3953
02:27:36.326 --> 02:27:38.163
SAM and MARISHA: ♪ Making my way into the chamber ♪

3954
02:27:38.163 --> 02:27:40.330
MATT: So roll a stealth check.

3955
02:27:42.199 --> 02:27:44.797
MARISHA: Natural 20.
MATT: Okay.

3956
02:27:44.797 --> 02:27:46.327
You actually hear the night elf sound

3957
02:27:46.327 --> 02:27:48.473
from World of Warcraft (whooshes)

3958
02:27:48.473 --> 02:27:51.560
as you slowly make your way in.

3959
02:27:51.560 --> 02:27:53.331
You enter the chamber, carefully looking around,

3960
02:27:53.331 --> 02:27:55.644
you can see now within this area with your darkvision,

3961
02:27:55.644 --> 02:27:58.555
immediately in your vicinity, a number of chains,

3962
02:27:58.555 --> 02:28:00.259
manacles that are hanging from there.

3963
02:28:00.259 --> 02:28:03.022
Open, you don't see anything in them.

3964
02:28:03.022 --> 02:28:05.522
The room itself, the floor has

3965
02:28:06.679 --> 02:28:09.679
bits of broken bone,

3966
02:28:11.008 --> 02:28:14.106
tattered, looks like paper in sections of the floor.

3967
02:28:14.106 --> 02:28:15.779
You can see the racks that have

3968
02:28:15.779 --> 02:28:19.820
some sort of implements or tools placed in them

3969
02:28:19.820 --> 02:28:21.291
and one area to your immediate left

3970
02:28:21.291 --> 02:28:23.215
and one across the way on the opposite wall,

3971
02:28:23.215 --> 02:28:25.809
you see that central platform there.

3972
02:28:25.809 --> 02:28:27.308
The top part of it, you can see,

3973
02:28:27.308 --> 02:28:30.085
it looks pretty smooth with some

3974
02:28:30.085 --> 02:28:31.444
grooved designs in the sides of it

3975
02:28:31.444 --> 02:28:34.279
that spiral slightly around, on the top of it.

3976
02:28:34.279 --> 02:28:37.302
It looks like a table about a foot-and-a-half across,

3977
02:28:37.302 --> 02:28:42.302
but you see three concave, almost bowl

3978
02:28:42.610 --> 02:28:44.470
openings set on the top of it.

3979
02:28:44.470 --> 02:28:48.223
Just three of them in a triangular formation.

3980
02:28:48.223 --> 02:28:51.680
The ground, you can see, about five feet each side of it

3981
02:28:51.680 --> 02:28:55.952
just turns into a slope at a 45 degree angle

3982
02:28:55.952 --> 02:28:58.253
where it's not the entire floor,

3983
02:28:58.253 --> 02:29:00.202
but about a 15-foot span on each side of it,

3984
02:29:00.202 --> 02:29:03.652
just slopes down and then vanishes in darkness below.

3985
02:29:03.652 --> 02:29:04.800
You can walk all the way up and look down

3986
02:29:04.800 --> 02:29:06.022
if you want to try and inspect it.

3987
02:29:06.022 --> 02:29:07.921
MARISHA: I will do that now

3988
02:29:07.921 --> 02:29:12.456
and does it look like there's blood?

3989
02:29:12.456 --> 02:29:14.612
MATT: It's hard without any light in here.

3990
02:29:14.612 --> 02:29:16.399
You can get a little bit of light that's bouncing from Caleb

3991
02:29:16.399 --> 02:29:19.340
and you can't make out color in this space.

3992
02:29:19.340 --> 02:29:21.521
You can just make out shapes with your darkvision,

3993
02:29:21.521 --> 02:29:23.061
but make a perception check

3994
02:29:23.061 --> 02:29:25.387
as you glance down at the areas left and right.

3995
02:29:25.387 --> 02:29:27.642
LIAM: Daylight would be reaching 30 feet if there's no--

3996
02:29:27.642 --> 02:29:30.594
MATT: It's hitting the hall, so there's a little bit

3997
02:29:30.594 --> 02:29:33.076
of light coming through.
TRAVIS: Refractory.

3998
02:29:33.076 --> 02:29:34.765
MARISHA: Perception?
MATT: Mm-hm.

3999
02:29:34.765 --> 02:29:35.598
MARISHA: 13.

4000
02:29:35.598 --> 02:29:38.152
MATT: 13. You glance off to the side and look down

4001
02:29:38.152 --> 02:29:39.214
and from what you can see,

4002
02:29:39.214 --> 02:29:40.651
the slopes are somewhat pockmarked,

4003
02:29:40.651 --> 02:29:42.608
though they're imperfect. It's not totally smooth.

4004
02:29:42.608 --> 02:29:44.543
There's little, you know, sections

4005
02:29:44.543 --> 02:29:45.580
that are either broken

4006
02:29:45.580 --> 02:29:47.866
or there's divots in them or little shelves.

4007
02:29:47.866 --> 02:29:49.627
It's hard to see.

4008
02:29:49.627 --> 02:29:51.030
You can see through the light that's coming through,

4009
02:29:51.030 --> 02:29:53.878
dark streaks. It looks like some sort of

4010
02:29:53.878 --> 02:29:55.378
substance that dried on a long time ago.

4011
02:29:55.378 --> 02:29:56.397
MARISHA: Blood.

4012
02:29:56.397 --> 02:29:57.651
MATT: Looking down, towards the--

4013
02:29:57.651 --> 02:29:59.129
MARISHA: Yeah, maple.
MATT: -- the one to the right

4014
02:29:59.129 --> 02:30:00.655
that you're closest to as you glance down,

4015
02:30:00.655 --> 02:30:02.979
you can see some sort of

4016
02:30:02.979 --> 02:30:06.959
a textured pile just beyond where the light can see.

4017
02:30:06.959 --> 02:30:09.586
Your darkvision allows you to see bodies.

4018
02:30:09.586 --> 02:30:11.060
MARISHA: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
MATT: Bodies and bodies

4019
02:30:11.060 --> 02:30:12.506
and bodies and bodies, dozens.

4020
02:30:12.506 --> 02:30:14.073
Dozens and dozens

4021
02:30:14.073 --> 02:30:17.162
that vanish below, where the wall hits and stops.

4022
02:30:17.162 --> 02:30:20.577
This dark space continues below it so

4023
02:30:20.577 --> 02:30:23.599
whatever this chamber is, whatever's holding these bodies

4024
02:30:23.599 --> 02:30:27.959
seems to extend below and beyond the perimeter of the room.

4025
02:30:27.959 --> 02:30:28.792
MARISHA: Okay.

4026
02:30:28.792 --> 02:30:30.243
I just turn around.

4027
02:30:30.243 --> 02:30:31.694
I don't want to say anything.

4028
02:30:31.694 --> 02:30:32.948
MATT: I'd say that's your turn.

4029
02:30:32.948 --> 02:30:34.170
You've done a lot this turn

4030
02:30:34.170 --> 02:30:36.196
and inspecting and taking all of this information in.

4031
02:30:36.196 --> 02:30:38.863
That brings us to this creature.

4032
02:30:41.525 --> 02:30:44.705
It is going to come down on top of Jester

4033
02:30:44.705 --> 02:30:47.966
and attempt to strike you twice.

4034
02:30:47.966 --> 02:30:50.212
That's going to be a natural 20.

4035
02:30:50.212 --> 02:30:52.310
TALIESIN: Can I see it?
TRAVIS: I don't think so.

4036
02:30:52.310 --> 02:30:53.885
MATT: No, not at this height, you cannot.

4037
02:30:53.885 --> 02:30:56.081
TALIESIN: Can I see Jester though, hold on.

4038
02:30:56.081 --> 02:30:58.902
MATT: No, you have no idea this is happening.

4039
02:30:58.902 --> 02:31:00.016
The creature is invisible anyway.

4040
02:31:00.016 --> 02:31:02.732
It would have to be a creature you can see which you cannot.

4041
02:31:02.732 --> 02:31:04.814
That would be a 20 to hit.

4042
02:31:04.814 --> 02:31:06.521
LAURA: Yeah, it hits me both times.

4043
02:31:06.521 --> 02:31:10.744
MATT: All right, so critical, that's 16 plus three.

4044
02:31:10.744 --> 02:31:13.095
19 points of bludgeoning damage on the critical.

4045
02:31:13.095 --> 02:31:16.025
LAURA: So that's four to myself.

4046
02:31:16.025 --> 02:31:18.171
I'm now Jester again.
MATT: Okay.

4047
02:31:18.171 --> 02:31:21.245
Then Jester takes an additional

4048
02:31:21.245 --> 02:31:23.717
11 points of bludgeoning damage from it

4049
02:31:23.717 --> 02:31:25.564
after you revert back to your normal form.

4050
02:31:25.564 --> 02:31:26.981
LAURA: Oh, yeah, yeah.

4051
02:31:30.603 --> 02:31:31.825
MATT: Then the creature is going to

4052
02:31:31.825 --> 02:31:34.287
back up into the mist and try and vanish again.

4053
02:31:34.287 --> 02:31:36.956
Make your attack, with disadvantage.

4054
02:31:36.956 --> 02:31:38.706
LAURA: (groans)

4055
02:31:38.706 --> 02:31:41.114
SAM: Come on! Come on!

4056
02:31:42.315 --> 02:31:45.963
LAURA: Wait, is that eight plus eight, 16.

4057
02:31:45.963 --> 02:31:48.159
MATT: 16 hits.
(cheering)

4058
02:31:48.159 --> 02:31:49.384
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage.

4059
02:31:49.384 --> 02:31:50.517
SAM: Kill this fucker.

4060
02:31:50.517 --> 02:31:53.428
LAURA: Oh, definitely, this is definitely going to kill it.

4061
02:31:53.428 --> 02:31:55.494
Yeah, six points.

4062
02:31:55.494 --> 02:31:57.527
MATT: Awesome. Is your weapon magical?

4063
02:31:57.527 --> 02:31:59.260
LAURA: Oh, it is,

4064
02:31:59.260 --> 02:32:01.426
well, no, it's just a plus one handaxe. But--

4065
02:32:01.426 --> 02:32:03.459
MATT: Plus one? That's magical.

4066
02:32:03.459 --> 02:32:05.059
LAURA: Oh, sweet, yes, it's magical.

4067
02:32:05.059 --> 02:32:09.131
And I get poison damage in addition to it now, right?

4068
02:32:09.131 --> 02:32:12.147
SAM: The mist is going to have a tough time bleeding.

4069
02:32:12.147 --> 02:32:14.953
MATT: It does not seem to have much of an effect.

4070
02:32:14.953 --> 02:32:17.469
But it takes the damage (growls)

4071
02:32:17.469 --> 02:32:19.155
and vanishes into the mist.

4072
02:32:19.155 --> 02:32:20.195
TALIESIN: Damn.
MATT: All right.

4073
02:32:20.195 --> 02:32:23.747
That brings us to Caleb's go.

4074
02:32:23.747 --> 02:32:25.405
LIAM: I'm still in the chamber.

4075
02:32:25.405 --> 02:32:26.880
Now it's Jester and I down here?

4076
02:32:26.880 --> 02:32:28.406
MATT: Yep.

4077
02:32:28.406 --> 02:32:33.387
LIAM: I'm going to take a chance and bat guano and sulfur

4078
02:32:33.387 --> 02:32:36.774
and I'm going to throw a Fireball up about

4079
02:32:36.774 --> 02:32:39.104
50 feet and set it off above us.

4080
02:32:39.104 --> 02:32:40.267
MATT: 50 feet?
LIAM: Yeah.

4081
02:32:40.267 --> 02:32:41.100
MATT: Okay.

4082
02:32:42.654 --> 02:32:43.487
All right.

4083
02:32:45.699 --> 02:32:48.052
50 feet, yeah, that'll get it.

4084
02:32:48.052 --> 02:32:49.550
(laughs)

4085
02:32:49.550 --> 02:32:51.986
All right, so it's going to make a dexterity saving throw,

4086
02:32:51.986 --> 02:32:55.086
that is going to be 12, nope.

4087
02:33:02.481 --> 02:33:04.205
LIAM: Okay, here we go.

4088
02:33:04.205 --> 02:33:05.622
Two, three, four.

4089
02:33:07.633 --> 02:33:11.119
SAM: Ah, Jesus.
LIAM: Five, eight, not that good.

4090
02:33:11.119 --> 02:33:14.348
16, 18, 20, 22 points of fire damage.

4091
02:33:14.348 --> 02:33:16.787
MATT: 22 points of fire damage, all righty.

4092
02:33:16.787 --> 02:33:19.513
You see the heat evaporates a bunch of the mist

4093
02:33:19.513 --> 02:33:22.020
and, for a second, you see a pocket of open air

4094
02:33:22.020 --> 02:33:23.405
and you hear this scream

4095
02:33:23.405 --> 02:33:25.509
and a bit of the flames shift around a shape.

4096
02:33:25.509 --> 02:33:28.904
This loosely humanoid, but extended,

4097
02:33:28.904 --> 02:33:33.120
a ghostly whipping wind version of a humanoid shape

4098
02:33:33.120 --> 02:33:35.027
and then, as the flames vanish,

4099
02:33:35.027 --> 02:33:36.680
the mist slowly fills it back in

4100
02:33:36.680 --> 02:33:37.650
and you have no idea where the creature went.

4101
02:33:37.650 --> 02:33:40.895
LIAM: I'm going to then back just in the doorway,

4102
02:33:40.895 --> 02:33:42.884
not even going that far, so that I could still

4103
02:33:42.884 --> 02:33:44.563
pop one out if I needed to.
MATT: You've got it.

4104
02:33:44.563 --> 02:33:46.845
That finishes your go.
LIAM: Yeah.

4105
02:33:46.845 --> 02:33:48.903
MATT: Nott, Caduceus, anything you want to do this turn?

4106
02:33:48.903 --> 02:33:51.262
You're just waiting on Beau. You heading in with her?

4107
02:33:51.262 --> 02:33:52.095
SAM: Did she go in?

4108
02:33:52.095 --> 02:33:53.588
MATT: She went into the room, yeah.

4109
02:33:53.588 --> 02:33:54.957
SAM: Wow.
TALIESIN: I'm holding

4110
02:33:54.957 --> 02:33:56.602
just to get people through.

4111
02:33:56.602 --> 02:33:58.161
MATT: You got it.

4112
02:33:58.161 --> 02:34:00.870
TALIESIN: I'm waiting for people to come through

4113
02:34:00.870 --> 02:34:02.687
and holding the door.

4114
02:34:02.687 --> 02:34:03.757
MATT: You're holding your action on the door,

4115
02:34:03.757 --> 02:34:06.285
going to grab and try and close it.

4116
02:34:06.285 --> 02:34:07.327
SAM: Shut the door?

4117
02:34:07.327 --> 02:34:08.693
LIAM: Jester's still in the chamber.

4118
02:34:10.339 --> 02:34:12.506
SAM: We don't have a key thing.

4119
02:34:14.144 --> 02:34:17.846
I'll look if there's a handy dandy, you know,

4120
02:34:17.846 --> 02:34:20.570
foot pedal to close the door with or something.

4121
02:34:20.570 --> 02:34:22.159
MATT: Okay, make a perception check

4122
02:34:22.159 --> 02:34:24.614
or investigation check for you. Either/or for this.

4123
02:34:24.614 --> 02:34:25.447
SAM: 14.

4124
02:34:25.447 --> 02:34:27.575
MATT: 14. You don't see any pedals or anything.

4125
02:34:27.575 --> 02:34:28.742
There are elements of the door

4126
02:34:28.742 --> 02:34:31.615
that could be pulled, maybe, but you don't see a pedal.

4127
02:34:31.615 --> 02:34:32.930
TALIESIN: Is everybody out of the room already?

4128
02:34:32.930 --> 02:34:33.923
MATT: Jester's in there still.

4129
02:34:33.923 --> 02:34:35.142
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm just waiting.

4130
02:34:35.142 --> 02:34:36.183
LAURA: It's okay, just close the door.

4131
02:34:36.183 --> 02:34:37.919
Leave me in here. It's no big deal, whatever.

4132
02:34:37.919 --> 02:34:39.086
LIAM: That's the plan, that's the plan.

4133
02:34:39.086 --> 02:34:40.453
MATT: You staying put or are you moving in with Beau?

4134
02:34:40.453 --> 02:34:44.282
SAM: I'll stay at the door and hold my action

4135
02:34:44.282 --> 02:34:46.381
to fire if I see the mist thing.

4136
02:34:46.381 --> 02:34:48.175
MATT: Fjord.
TRAVIS: What?

4137
02:34:48.175 --> 02:34:53.107
MATT: You doing anything?
(laughter)

4138
02:34:53.107 --> 02:34:54.301
All right, Jester, what are you--

4139
02:34:54.301 --> 02:34:55.134
TRAVIS: I'll move forward.

4140
02:34:55.134 --> 02:34:56.999
I'll move forward with Beau, up to Beau.

4141
02:34:56.999 --> 02:34:58.739
MATT: You move in with Beau and you

4142
02:34:58.739 --> 02:35:02.039
perceive the same space and scenery around you.

4143
02:35:02.039 --> 02:35:04.253
TRAVIS: And that's it.
MATT: All right.

4144
02:35:04.253 --> 02:35:05.523
Jester.

4145
02:35:05.523 --> 02:35:07.080
LAURA: I guess I will leave the room then.

4146
02:35:07.080 --> 02:35:09.457
MATT: All right. Go ahead and enter the chamber.

4147
02:35:09.457 --> 02:35:10.906
TALIESIN: Close the door.
(whooshes)

4148
02:35:10.906 --> 02:35:15.275
MATT: The door closes. It closes and you hear (clicking).

4149
02:35:15.275 --> 02:35:17.950
Ting, ting, ting, ting, ting on the opposite side.

4150
02:35:17.950 --> 02:35:20.783
LIAM: The key spit out a one-way trip.

4151
02:35:21.839 --> 02:35:23.050
SAM: We're safe!
TRAVIS: That's okay.

4152
02:35:23.050 --> 02:35:24.612
We can get out of there.

4153
02:35:24.612 --> 02:35:26.218
TALIESIN: I'll also say that we can, probably,

4154
02:35:26.218 --> 02:35:28.765
worse case scenario, teleport through.

4155
02:35:28.765 --> 02:35:30.742
MATT: As you take a moment to

4156
02:35:30.742 --> 02:35:33.492
breathe in a moment of apparent safety,

4157
02:35:33.492 --> 02:35:35.967
we're going to go to a break

4158
02:35:35.967 --> 02:35:37.394
because that's got to happen, too.

4159
02:35:37.394 --> 02:35:39.238
All right, we got a giveaway here

4160
02:35:39.238 --> 02:35:40.883
from our friends at Wyrmwood.

4161
02:35:40.883 --> 02:35:43.358
Bolivian rosewood

4162
02:35:44.360 --> 02:35:47.604
tabletop tray, leather interior. It's really pretty.

4163
02:35:47.604 --> 02:35:49.252
To any lucky winners there in the chat,

4164
02:35:49.252 --> 02:35:50.856
while we're at break, go ahead and enter

4165
02:35:50.856 --> 02:35:53.646
the keyword tonight which is cage.

4166
02:35:53.646 --> 02:35:54.829
C-A-G-E.

4167
02:35:54.829 --> 02:35:58.327
Go ahead and toss that once, not more than once,

4168
02:35:58.327 --> 02:35:59.746
in the chat or you'll be disqualified.

4169
02:35:59.746 --> 02:36:01.914
Once again, U.S. and Canada only, excluding Quebec.

4170
02:36:01.914 --> 02:36:03.160
We'll come back here shortly with--

4171
02:36:03.160 --> 02:36:04.222
TRAVIS: Can we give a round of applause

4172
02:36:04.222 --> 02:36:06.425
to the fucking map by Mr. Mercer?

4173
02:36:06.425 --> 02:36:09.130
(applause)
LAURA: That was really cool.

4174
02:36:09.130 --> 02:36:11.332
ASHLEY: So cool.
SAM: It's also--

4175
02:36:11.332 --> 02:36:12.804
it was his wedding cake.

4176
02:36:12.804 --> 02:36:15.455
(laughter)
TALIESIN: I mean--

4177
02:36:15.455 --> 02:36:17.072
MATT: Not that far off.

4178
02:36:17.072 --> 02:36:17.996
We'll be back here in a few minutes.

4179
02:36:17.996 --> 02:36:20.584
We'll see you guys shortly.

4180
02:36:20.584 --> 02:36:22.128

TRAVIS (VO): Last time on Yee-Haw Game Ranch.

4199
02:37:12.571 --> 02:37:14.588
SAM: Howdy, boys!

4200
02:37:15.575 --> 02:37:18.467
BRIAN: What? A dragon?

4201
02:37:18.467 --> 02:37:19.678
Who are you?

4202
02:37:19.678 --> 02:37:23.944
SAM: Mortals have named me Drak'Ar Noir.

4203
02:37:23.944 --> 02:37:25.894
TRAVIS: (laughs)

4204
02:37:25.894 --> 02:37:29.134
No, nope.
BRIAN: I don't think so.

4205
02:37:29.134 --> 02:37:32.817
Wait, your name is Drak'Ar Noir?

4206
02:37:32.817 --> 02:37:35.533
Like the cologne I wore in middle school?

4207
02:37:35.533 --> 02:37:39.766
SAM: I have no idea what you're talking about, mortal.

4208
02:37:39.766 --> 02:37:42.459
I have flown from a realm far away

4209
02:37:42.459 --> 02:37:44.183
through the shattered isles

4210
02:37:44.183 --> 02:37:45.790
of the gameverse.

4211
02:37:45.790 --> 02:37:47.517
On my travels, I've heard tales

4212
02:37:47.517 --> 02:37:52.517
from many critters of a man they call the Chosen One.

4213
02:37:52.890 --> 02:37:55.014
BRIAN: Wait, but you haven't heard about me?

4214
02:37:55.014 --> 02:37:57.543
SAM: I mean, yeah, I've heard about you.

4215
02:37:57.543 --> 02:38:02.409
TRAVIS: (laughs) I like him!

4216
02:38:02.409 --> 02:38:05.711
SAM: They say a tether ball's pole's

4217
02:38:05.711 --> 02:38:07.292
got more meat on it than you.

4218
02:38:07.292 --> 02:38:09.128
TRAVIS: (wheezes)
SAM: That you're a

4219
02:38:09.128 --> 02:38:12.642
malnourished, dried up volleyball-looking little fuck.

4220
02:38:12.642 --> 02:38:14.503
TRAVIS: (laughs)

4221
02:38:14.503 --> 02:38:17.083
SAM: And once again, keep in mind, this is not me.

4222
02:38:17.083 --> 02:38:18.859
I am merely a messenger

4223
02:38:18.859 --> 02:38:20.782
of the many bards across the lands.

4224
02:38:20.782 --> 02:38:23.456
TRAVIS: Look at the little--
BRIAN: Okay, okay.

4225
02:38:23.456 --> 02:38:25.646
Where are you from, anyway, Drak'Ar?

4226
02:38:25.646 --> 02:38:27.549
SAM: I'm so glad you asked!

4227
02:38:27.549 --> 02:38:31.075
I come from one of the most prestigious game realms:

4228
02:38:31.075 --> 02:38:34.400
Yee-Haw Fantasy Ranch.

TRAVIS: Ooh!

4230
02:38:35.683 --> 02:38:37.327
BRIAN: What can we do for you?

4231
02:38:37.327 --> 02:38:39.966
SAM: I came to present a song,

4232
02:38:39.966 --> 02:38:42.177
to sing for the Chosen One.
TRAVIS: No.

4233
02:38:42.177 --> 02:38:44.633
BRIAN: Oh!
SAM: A sort of battle hymn,

4234
02:38:44.633 --> 02:38:46.116
if you will.
TRAVIS: No.

02:38:46.116 --> 02:38:47.399

BRIAN: What was the thing with the bombs on this one, dude?

4249
02:39:30.083 --> 02:39:33.188
TRAVIS: When they land or what?

4250
02:39:33.188 --> 02:39:37.504
Don't fucking when you see me (burps).

4251
02:39:37.504 --> 02:39:39.698
BRIAN: Dude, we're on the internet right now.

4252
02:39:39.698 --> 02:39:40.557
TRAVIS: Hey, I got one of them.

4253
02:39:40.557 --> 02:39:42.519
BRIAN: Oh, I was looking at your guy.

4254
02:39:42.519 --> 02:39:44.501
Oh, okay, well.

4255
02:39:44.501 --> 02:39:46.612
TRAVIS: I went and grabbed it and it--

4256
02:39:46.612 --> 02:39:48.327
MAX: That's not what the bomb arrows look like.

4257
02:39:48.327 --> 02:39:50.596
TRAVIS: Fucking Max with the bait and switch.

4258
02:39:50.596 --> 02:39:52.924
We have yet to see a bomb arrow.

4259
02:39:52.924 --> 02:39:54.396
BRIAN: We have yet to see your butthole.

4260
02:39:54.396 --> 02:39:56.064
TRAVIS: Is this gray thing going to hurt me, Max?

4261
02:39:56.064 --> 02:39:57.172
MAX: Nope.
TRAVIS: Okay.

4262
02:39:57.172 --> 02:39:59.377
Why am I on acid now?
BRIAN: Whoa.

4263
02:39:59.377 --> 02:40:02.102
TRAVIS: Why am I tripping ballsacks?

4264
02:40:02.102 --> 02:40:03.025
BRIAN: No!

4265
02:40:03.025 --> 02:40:05.594
TRAVIS: How'd that arrow make it through?

4266
02:40:05.594 --> 02:40:06.482
Boom!

4267
02:40:06.482 --> 02:40:07.315
(shouting)

4268
02:40:07.315 --> 02:40:08.855
BRAIN: No, take the ticket. Take it!

4269
02:40:08.855 --> 02:40:11.646
TRAVIS: (yelling) I don't want to be inebriated!

4270
02:40:11.646 --> 02:40:12.770
BRIAN: Come here with your pity shield.

4271
02:40:12.770 --> 02:40:13.603
TRAVIS: Fuck you, go away.

4272
02:40:13.603 --> 02:40:14.598
BRIAN: No, give me your pity shield.

4273
02:40:14.598 --> 02:40:16.277
TRAVIS: I don't want you following me anymore.

4274
02:40:16.277 --> 02:40:20.837
Stop trying to--
(laughter)

4275
02:40:20.837 --> 02:40:23.504
BRIAN: You just unloaded 50 missiles.

4276
02:40:25.456 --> 02:40:26.980
Don't take any of mine.

4277
02:40:26.980 --> 02:40:28.230
TRAVIS: Nobody cares.

4278
02:40:29.345 --> 02:40:30.637
BRAIN: Poor Jerry.

4279
02:40:30.637 --> 02:40:34.137
I can't believe you talk to him like that.

4280
02:40:35.771 --> 02:40:37.505
Press this.

4281
02:40:38.412 --> 02:40:41.154
You keep-- dude.
TRAVIS: Thanks, dude!

4282
02:40:42.391 --> 02:40:43.224
I'm ready.

4283
02:40:44.600 --> 02:40:46.423
I'm sure it's all about the chests that will fall

4284
02:40:46.423 --> 02:40:48.103
and they give you this thing.

4285
02:40:48.103 --> 02:40:51.436
Laser!
(offscreen laughing)

4286
02:40:53.074 --> 02:40:54.487
BRIAN: Wait.

4287
02:40:54.487 --> 02:40:58.886
Laser error-- oh, it bounces back back at you, son.

4288
02:40:58.886 --> 02:41:00.969
Be careful.

4289
02:41:00.969 --> 02:41:04.619
(keyboard clicking)

4290
02:41:04.619 --> 02:41:06.087
DANI: Hey, Christina, package.

4291
02:41:06.087 --> 02:41:09.186
(dramatic music)

4292
02:41:09.186 --> 02:41:10.678
(angelic choir)

4293
02:41:14.123 --> 02:41:19.038
(whooshing)
(beeping)

4294
02:41:19.038 --> 02:41:21.788
(coffee pouring)

4295
02:41:26.760 --> 02:41:28.834
BRIAN: Hello, Christina.

4296
02:41:28.834 --> 02:41:31.673
Tell me your backstory.
(dramatic music)

4297
02:41:31.673 --> 02:41:33.822
(cup shattering)

4298
02:41:33.822 --> 02:41:38.822
(footsteps)
(intense music)

4299
02:41:41.554 --> 02:41:43.996
BRIAN: Have you always wanted to be a voice actor?

4300
02:41:43.996 --> 02:41:47.687
(suspenseful strings)

4301
02:41:50.446 --> 02:41:52.614
CHRISTINA: He's here.
BRIAN: Who's here?

4302
02:41:52.614 --> 02:41:57.614
(high-pitched cut off scream)
(speakeasy music)

4303
02:42:05.395 --> 02:42:08.251
BRIAN (VO): Last time on Talks Machina.

4304
02:42:08.251 --> 02:42:12.213
SAM: Every character should really be a substance abuser.

4305
02:42:12.213 --> 02:42:17.177
If you see the shit that an average Dungeons &amp; Dragons

4306
02:42:17.177 --> 02:42:19.378
character sees on a day-to-day basis--

4307
02:42:19.378 --> 02:42:20.298
BRIAN: Yeah, you'd need to get--
SAM: Monsters.

4308
02:42:20.298 --> 02:42:21.723
BRIAN: --fucked up at the end of--
SAM: Death.

4309
02:42:21.723 --> 02:42:24.300
DANI: Demons.
SAM: Horrible demons.

4310
02:42:24.300 --> 02:42:27.337
DANI: A chair in the middle of a room.

4311
02:42:27.337 --> 02:42:30.100
SAM: Yes, that's freaky shit.

4312
02:42:30.100 --> 02:42:31.408
A chair?
DANI: What the fuck?!

4313
02:42:31.408 --> 02:42:32.768
SAM: Just sitting there.

4314
02:42:32.768 --> 02:42:35.223
BRIAN: A rug that tries to suffocate you.

4315
02:42:35.223 --> 02:42:38.724
SAM: Yes, there is scary-ass shit in Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

4316
02:42:38.724 --> 02:42:40.732
BRIAN: A gelatinous cube.
DANI: Gelatinous cubes

4317
02:42:40.732 --> 02:42:42.483
are fucking creepy.

4318
02:42:42.483 --> 02:42:44.872
LIAM: Steve Martin gunslinger shooting a 14-year-old

4319
02:42:44.872 --> 02:42:46.829
through the hand. That's intense.

4320
02:42:46.829 --> 02:42:48.527
DANI: Yes!
BRIAN: Wow.

4321
02:42:48.527 --> 02:42:50.730
SAM: I don't think--
DANI: Your soul <i>is</i> forfeit!

4322
02:42:50.730 --> 02:42:54.160
SAM: If I, Sam Riegel, were a part of an adventuring party

4323
02:42:54.160 --> 02:42:56.457
in a Dungeons &amp; Dragons-style adventure,

4324
02:42:56.457 --> 02:42:58.671
I wouldn't last one game.

4325
02:42:58.671 --> 02:43:01.936
I would be like, "Nope, I'm outta here!"

4326
02:43:01.936 --> 02:43:05.262
It would be the shortest shit ever.

4327
02:43:05.262 --> 02:43:07.770
The characters need a reason to stay there.

4328
02:43:07.770 --> 02:43:10.992
Yes, it doesn't have to be substance abuse.

4329
02:43:10.992 --> 02:43:12.695
It could be something else,

4330
02:43:12.695 --> 02:43:15.102
but for me, I rely on that a lot, all right?

4331
02:43:15.102 --> 02:43:16.895
It's a crutch.
BRIAN: I understand.

4332
02:43:16.895 --> 02:43:21.623
LIAM: Everybody, again, take away your 2019 suburbia goggles

4333
02:43:21.623 --> 02:43:23.244
and put yourself into hell.

4334
02:43:23.244 --> 02:43:24.453
These people are in hell.

4335
02:43:24.453 --> 02:43:27.910
They're seeing people decapitated, melted in acid.

4336
02:43:27.910 --> 02:43:29.426
SAM: It's awful!
LIAM: Vored.

4337
02:43:29.426 --> 02:43:31.209
It's vored constantly.

4338
02:43:31.209 --> 02:43:33.268
SAM: Why do people play this game?

4339
02:43:33.268 --> 02:43:34.681
It's satanic.

4340
02:43:34.681 --> 02:43:36.856
BRIAN: Oh, maybe it all circles back around

4341
02:43:36.856 --> 02:43:38.381
and maybe it really is.

4342
02:43:38.381 --> 02:43:39.557
LIAM: It's all about voring.

4343
02:43:39.557 --> 02:43:41.333
BRIAN: Maybe it was Satan.

4344
02:43:41.333 --> 02:43:42.916
Satan was the friend we made along the way.

4345
02:43:42.916 --> 02:43:44.885
That's the theme of D&amp;D.

4346
02:43:44.885 --> 02:43:47.215
Ultimately, it was Satan.

4347
02:43:47.215 --> 02:43:48.592
Plus, with you sitting right next to her,

4348
02:43:48.592 --> 02:43:50.136
when you're not looking at the Twitch chat

4349
02:43:50.136 --> 02:43:51.953
to try and figure out what to do next

4350
02:43:51.953 --> 02:43:54.750
or fishing for compliments, you can look at her journal,

4351
02:43:54.750 --> 02:43:55.663
because it's pretty close to

4352
02:43:55.663 --> 02:43:57.390
where you keep your iPad with it--

4353
02:43:57.390 --> 02:44:00.603
SAM: Small correction, I'm half on her journal

4354
02:44:00.603 --> 02:44:02.742
and half on the Reddit thread.

4355
02:44:02.742 --> 02:44:04.092
BRIAN: Oh, wow.

4356
02:44:04.092 --> 02:44:05.408
LIAM: You're also on Zillow a lot.

4357
02:44:05.408 --> 02:44:07.914
SAM: Well, you know, some three bedrooms

4358
02:44:07.914 --> 02:44:10.195
always pop up right in the middle of our game.

4359
02:44:10.195 --> 02:44:11.705
I want to be on top of them.

4360
02:44:11.705 --> 02:44:12.870
BRIAN: Are you having foundation issues

4361
02:44:12.870 --> 02:44:14.970
and you're thinking about--
SAM: Don't tell the buyer,

4362
02:44:14.970 --> 02:44:16.852
but yes.
BRIAN: Okay.

4363
02:44:16.852 --> 02:44:17.766
Our winner...

4364
02:44:17.766 --> 02:44:20.074
(spring rattling)

4365
02:44:20.074 --> 02:44:22.065
(laughter)

4366
02:44:22.065 --> 02:44:23.966
MAX: Thanks for the award.

4367
02:44:23.966 --> 02:44:26.962
BRIAN: We have no excuse. We have no, "Sorry, guys,

4368
02:44:26.962 --> 02:44:29.983
"we're super loopy from Denver, we just had--"

4369
02:44:29.983 --> 02:44:32.935
I don't know. Our winner-- can I get to the goddamn--

4370
02:44:32.935 --> 02:44:34.278
SAM: Yeah.
BRIAN: Our winner for

4371
02:44:34.278 --> 02:44:37.063
this week was sent in by Courtney Armstead.

4372
02:44:37.063 --> 02:44:38.917
DANI: It's so good!
BRIAN: It is.

4373
02:44:38.917 --> 02:44:41.624
@minomotu,

4375
02:44:45.699 --> 02:44:48.818
Let's take a look.
LIAM: Yes!

4376
02:44:48.818 --> 02:44:50.977
LIAM: I see Courtney every week.

4377
02:44:51.891 --> 02:44:54.940
They do Vex and Vax. They do Jester and Caleb

4378
02:44:54.940 --> 02:44:57.245
as goth twins.
SAM: Every week?

4379
02:44:57.245 --> 02:44:58.467
What are you talking about?
LIAM: They post--

4380
02:44:58.467 --> 02:45:01.337
I mean, I'm in the hashtag looking at art every week.

4381
02:45:01.337 --> 02:45:03.995
SAM: Submit!
LIAM: Hey!

4382
02:45:03.995 --> 02:45:05.847
(laughter)

4383
02:45:05.847 --> 02:45:09.108
LIAM: Gimme this. These are what these are for, right?

4384
02:45:09.108 --> 02:45:10.091
OFF-SCREEN: Franken-man.

4385
02:45:10.091 --> 02:45:11.833
LIAM: Yep.
DANI: (laughs)

4386
02:45:11.833 --> 02:45:15.913
LIAM: All right, bend over.
SAM: (laughs)

4387
02:45:15.913 --> 02:45:17.744
BRIAN: Ew.
LIAM: What?

4388
02:45:17.744 --> 02:45:19.709
BRIAN: Were you simulating-- you said bend over?

4389
02:45:19.709 --> 02:45:20.625
LIAM: You've never pummeled somebody

4390
02:45:20.625 --> 02:45:22.042
with trophies before?

4391
02:45:22.042 --> 02:45:24.849
BRIAN: But was that sort of like a heavy spanking

4392
02:45:24.849 --> 02:45:26.318
or where you penetrating?
LIAM: No, I meant for him to duck

4393
02:45:26.318 --> 02:45:27.870
so I could fight monsters, Brian.

4394
02:45:27.870 --> 02:45:30.537
BRIAN: Oh, I see, I see, that's cool.

4395
02:45:31.676 --> 02:45:36.676
I've never heard Sam's butt cheeks referred to as monsters.

4396
02:45:37.027 --> 02:45:38.027
SAM: Oh my god.

4397
02:45:39.112 --> 02:45:40.505
BRIAN: Max is throwing up in a bucket.

4398
02:45:40.505 --> 02:45:43.159
SAM: Oh, I pulled a muscle.
BRIAN: You did?

4399
02:45:43.159 --> 02:45:46.831
You did a Marisha?!
(laughter)

4400
02:45:46.831 --> 02:45:48.594
BRIAN: Wait, because of my joke?

4401
02:45:48.594 --> 02:45:50.788
SAM: Yes.
BRIAN: Oh!

4402
02:45:50.788 --> 02:45:53.026
In that case, my friends,

4403
02:45:53.026 --> 02:45:55.243
it's been wonderful hosting this show.

4404
02:45:55.243 --> 02:45:58.047
I am the fuck out of here.

4405
02:45:58.047 --> 02:45:59.675
I'm leaving.

4406
02:45:59.675 --> 02:46:02.975
(tense music)

4407
02:46:02.975 --> 02:46:05.209
TALIESIN: Like a symphony playing to an empty theater,

4408
02:46:05.209 --> 02:46:08.530
Critical Role dines alone without its audience.

4409
02:46:08.530 --> 02:46:12.144
Yes, that validating and most enthusiastic

4410
02:46:12.144 --> 02:46:16.435
congregation on the other side of the fourth wall.

4411
02:46:16.435 --> 02:46:18.782
And what is this fourth wall

4412
02:46:18.782 --> 02:46:21.457
separating the viewer from the creator?

4413
02:46:21.457 --> 02:46:26.067
A portal to an often-sought point of connection or

4414
02:46:26.067 --> 02:46:28.545
the Twitch Subscription Zone?

4415
02:46:28.545 --> 02:46:30.001
On the rare occasion that you miss

4416
02:46:30.001 --> 02:46:32.923
the live bacchanal boasted by the rag-tag group

4417
02:46:32.923 --> 02:46:35.141
of thespians on Thursday night,

4418
02:46:35.141 --> 02:46:37.250
you may always view this show on demand,

4419
02:46:37.250 --> 02:46:42.085
in the shadowland known as the Twitch Subscription Zone.

4420
02:46:42.085 --> 02:46:44.221
Picture, if you will, the necessary pieces

4421
02:46:44.221 --> 02:46:46.387
to complete a jigsaw puzzle,

4422
02:46:46.387 --> 02:46:49.645
but it's up to you to choose how it will be solved.

4423
02:46:49.645 --> 02:46:53.417
You could, of course, subscribe with your debt rectangle.

4424
02:46:53.417 --> 02:46:56.586
But many more divergent paths lie before you.

4425
02:46:56.586 --> 02:46:58.994
Perhaps you've found yourself in possession of

4426
02:46:58.994 --> 02:47:00.994
an Amazon Prime account.

4427
02:47:01.881 --> 02:47:03.177
You would then wake up to discover

4428
02:47:03.177 --> 02:47:05.784
a free Twitch subscription each month

4429
02:47:05.784 --> 02:47:08.011
for a channel of your choosing.

4430
02:47:08.011 --> 02:47:09.983
But this artifact demands renewal,

4431
02:47:09.983 --> 02:47:12.124
for you must re-subscribe each month

4432
02:47:12.124 --> 02:47:15.264
to quench its unyielding thirst.

4433
02:47:15.264 --> 02:47:17.162
One need not walk alone.

4434
02:47:17.162 --> 02:47:18.883
Those who have already found their way

4435
02:47:18.883 --> 02:47:21.073
can illuminate the path for others

4436
02:47:21.073 --> 02:47:24.073
via the Gift a Sub button on Twitch.

4437
02:47:25.525 --> 02:47:28.249
Critical Role is humbled by your subscription

4438
02:47:28.249 --> 02:47:31.895
and wishes to thank you from behind the thin veil of this

4439
02:47:31.895 --> 02:47:33.324
fourth wall.

4440
02:47:33.324 --> 02:47:36.932
We hope you enjoy our content as much as we enjoy making it.

4441
02:47:36.932 --> 02:47:39.688
And so ends another meandering digression,

4442
02:47:39.688 --> 02:47:43.334
a complicated parody promo down an indistinct highway

4443
02:47:43.334 --> 02:47:44.750
to the region we call

4444
02:47:45.701 --> 02:47:47.548
the Twitch Subscription Zone.

4445
02:47:47.548 --> 02:47:52.406
(eerie music)

4446
02:47:56.087 --> 02:47:59.153
(hypnotizing voice) You will subscribe.

4447
02:47:59.153 --> 02:48:02.001
Twitch Prime subscribe.

4448
02:48:02.001 --> 02:48:04.101
Gift subscribe.

4449
02:48:05.486 --> 02:48:09.276
(drawn out) Subscribe.

4450
02:48:09.276 --> 02:48:14.101
(eerie music)

4451
02:48:15.754 --> 02:48:20.537
(dramatic orchestra score)

4452
02:48:36.357 --> 02:48:41.290
(dramatic music)

4453
03:01:29.573 --> 03:01:30.533
MATT: Welcome back, everybody.

4454
03:01:30.533 --> 03:01:32.596
So we have a winner for our giveaway.

4455
03:01:32.596 --> 03:01:35.610
The winner, one of my favorite online handles in a while,

4456
03:01:35.610 --> 03:01:38.435
siegeweasel.
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah!

4457
03:01:38.435 --> 03:01:40.443
MATT: Congratulations, siegeweasel.

4458
03:01:40.443 --> 03:01:42.693
We'll get that to you ASAP.

4459
03:01:44.641 --> 03:01:47.729
One of the best ones they've got.

4460
03:01:47.729 --> 03:01:49.762
LIAM: (small creature voice) I'm coming in!

4461
03:01:50.848 --> 03:01:54.222
MARISHA: Honey Heist 4: The Siege Weasel.

4462
03:01:56.076 --> 03:01:59.393
MATT: So as you all filter into the hallway

4463
03:01:59.393 --> 03:02:03.730
and the chamber beyond, the mist no longer makes its way

4464
03:02:03.730 --> 03:02:04.661
into the room before you.

4465
03:02:04.661 --> 03:02:09.284
You're looking and see Fjord and Beauregard at the ready.

4466
03:02:09.284 --> 03:02:13.038
Caduceus' staff lights up the interior chamber

4467
03:02:13.038 --> 03:02:14.521
a little better.

4468
03:02:14.521 --> 03:02:16.724
The light is still halved,

4469
03:02:16.724 --> 03:02:18.004
but you get to make out the colors

4470
03:02:18.004 --> 03:02:20.022
and you can see now across the floor,

4471
03:02:20.022 --> 03:02:22.174
there is spatterings of old, old,

4472
03:02:22.174 --> 03:02:25.231
long-dried dark brown-red blood

4473
03:02:25.231 --> 03:02:28.314
across the similar-colored stone.

4474
03:02:28.314 --> 03:02:32.224
You can see that central little pedestal

4475
03:02:32.224 --> 03:02:34.028
in the center of the chamber.

4476
03:02:34.028 --> 03:02:36.158
You can see the chains hanging from the walls.

4477
03:02:36.158 --> 03:02:38.518
You can see, across the way, there is another doorway.

4478
03:02:38.518 --> 03:02:39.641
It's not directly across.

4479
03:02:39.641 --> 03:02:42.117
It's to the left a little bit.

4480
03:02:42.117 --> 03:02:44.927
But it is a sealed door.

4481
03:02:44.927 --> 03:02:46.335
LAURA: Isildur.

4482
03:02:46.335 --> 03:02:47.762
MATT: Isildur.

4483
03:02:47.762 --> 03:02:49.189
LIAM: Get out.

4484
03:02:49.189 --> 03:02:50.782
MATT: (like Elrond) Destroy it!

4485
03:02:50.782 --> 03:02:51.615
TRAVIS: Got to give her credit for that.

4486
03:02:51.615 --> 03:02:53.115
MARISHA: I appreciated it.

4487
03:02:53.115 --> 03:02:54.427
MATT: (laughs) It was pretty good.

4488
03:02:54.427 --> 03:02:55.760
TRAVIS: (like Elrond) Isildur!

4489
03:02:56.647 --> 03:02:57.894
ASHLEY: Isildur.

4490
03:02:57.894 --> 03:03:02.144
MATT: The air in here, whereas the previous chamber was

4491
03:03:03.376 --> 03:03:07.126
cold and damp, this one is very warm and dry.

4492
03:03:09.750 --> 03:03:11.330
Like, even just the short time you've been in here,

4493
03:03:11.330 --> 03:03:13.864
you're like, mouth's a little dry.

4494
03:03:13.864 --> 03:03:17.764
It's that, arid, desert air but

4495
03:03:17.764 --> 03:03:19.103
the middle of a--
TRAVIS: Any current

4496
03:03:19.103 --> 03:03:21.735
that we can feel or is it just still?

4497
03:03:21.735 --> 03:03:23.902
MATT: Make a perception check.

4498
03:03:25.767 --> 03:03:27.517
TRAVIS: Eight.
MATT: No current.

4499
03:03:29.154 --> 03:03:30.460
It is still.

4500
03:03:30.460 --> 03:03:33.043
While the smell in here has

4501
03:03:34.599 --> 03:03:37.484
a hint of charcoal with a bit of bile and decay,

4502
03:03:37.484 --> 03:03:40.877
but it's not as strong as you would expect.

4503
03:03:40.877 --> 03:03:42.195
TRAVIS: Given all the gore.
MATT: Given all the gore

4504
03:03:42.195 --> 03:03:43.566
that's down here, yeah.

4505
03:03:43.566 --> 03:03:46.139
LIAM: I'm going to come in and walk up behind

4506
03:03:46.139 --> 03:03:47.750
Fjord and Beauregard and set the Driftglobe

4507
03:03:47.750 --> 03:03:49.840
just floating next to us and--
MATT: Okay.

4508
03:03:49.840 --> 03:03:53.490
LIAM: --and examine this structure here

4509
03:03:53.490 --> 03:03:55.595
and see if there's any writing on it.

4510
03:03:55.595 --> 03:03:57.420
Is it arcane in nature?

4511
03:03:57.420 --> 03:04:00.043
MATT: Okay, you look at it.

4512
03:04:00.043 --> 03:04:02.376
Make an investigation check.

4513
03:04:04.796 --> 03:04:06.462
LIAM: 23.

4514
03:04:06.462 --> 03:04:08.072
MATT: 23?
LIAM: Yeah.

4515
03:04:08.072 --> 03:04:09.318
MATT: Just glancing over

4516
03:04:09.318 --> 03:04:10.337
and looking at the sides of it

4517
03:04:10.337 --> 03:04:13.018
and looking around the central pedestal,

4518
03:04:13.018 --> 03:04:15.151
the grooves spiral up the side,

4519
03:04:15.151 --> 03:04:15.984
like from the ground.

4520
03:04:15.984 --> 03:04:20.121
There's these small, little thinly-chiseled

4521
03:04:20.121 --> 03:04:23.204
grooves that all slowly make their way up,

4522
03:04:23.204 --> 03:04:25.976
but there's no symbols, there's nothing that

4523
03:04:25.976 --> 03:04:29.050
catches your attention as runic.

4524
03:04:29.050 --> 03:04:31.467
MARISHA: Think this runs up or down?

4525
03:04:33.579 --> 03:04:35.412
If I had to guess, up,

4526
03:04:36.454 --> 03:04:39.537
based on the weeping angel situation.

4527
03:04:41.661 --> 03:04:42.714
TALIESIN: I'm already starting--

4528
03:04:42.714 --> 03:04:44.038
I'm going to start a Prayer of Healing

4529
03:04:44.038 --> 03:04:45.884
while this is all going on.
TRAVIS: Can you detect

4530
03:04:45.884 --> 03:04:50.411
if those baddies are cataloged as deceased?

4531
03:04:50.411 --> 03:04:52.162
TALIESIN: Yeah--
LAURA: I can look, too.

4532
03:04:52.162 --> 03:04:54.773
TALIESIN: You have a thing to do that?

4533
03:04:54.773 --> 03:04:56.811
LAURA: Oh, no.

4534
03:04:56.811 --> 03:04:59.293
But I can look at them.
TALIESIN: Oh, well, before I

4535
03:04:59.293 --> 03:05:00.704
go, then, I'm just going to do a really quick,

4536
03:05:00.704 --> 03:05:02.489
a really quick detect undead.

4537
03:05:02.489 --> 03:05:04.533
MATT: Okay, and what's the radius?

4538
03:05:04.533 --> 03:05:05.616
TALIESIN: I love you.

4539
03:05:06.532 --> 03:05:09.004
My radius is--

4540
03:05:09.004 --> 03:05:09.837
MATT: Is it 60 feet?

4541
03:05:09.837 --> 03:05:13.052
TALIESIN: I think it's-- yeah, it's 60 feet.

4542
03:05:13.052 --> 03:05:13.959
MATT: 60 feet, okay.

4543
03:05:13.959 --> 03:05:17.212
You step up to the edge and you concentrate.

4544
03:05:17.212 --> 03:05:20.545
One, two, three, four, five, 10, 20, 50.

4545
03:05:22.378 --> 03:05:25.010
Dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens

4546
03:05:25.010 --> 03:05:28.593
of undead just still that entire pile to each side.

4547
03:05:28.593 --> 03:05:31.327
Now that you can see, you don't know how deep it is,

4548
03:05:31.327 --> 03:05:32.468
but from the little bit of sense you have

4549
03:05:32.468 --> 03:05:35.383
at the slope going down, the slope continues.

4550
03:05:35.383 --> 03:05:37.908
TALIESIN: That's all undead.
(groans)

4551
03:05:37.908 --> 03:05:39.637
SAM: They're are undead?
MATT: It's faint.

4552
03:05:39.637 --> 03:05:41.343
It's very faint, but each one of those

4553
03:05:41.343 --> 03:05:42.759
has a slight undead signature.

4554
03:05:42.759 --> 03:05:45.015
TALIESIN: They're, they're all--

4555
03:05:45.015 --> 03:05:46.808
TRAVIS: Dozens and dozens, right?

4556
03:05:46.808 --> 03:05:49.308
TALIESIN: More than dozens and dozens.

4557
03:05:50.486 --> 03:05:53.069
MARISHA: What if this is a distillery?

4558
03:05:55.402 --> 03:05:56.939
TRAVIS: Huh?
MARISHA: Or like a farm.

4559
03:05:56.939 --> 03:05:59.602
LAURA: Like they grow dead people here?

4560
03:05:59.602 --> 03:06:03.382
Like, what do you mean?
MARISHA: Like they grow 'em,

4561
03:06:03.382 --> 03:06:06.922
slowly siphoning what's down there.

4562
03:06:06.922 --> 03:06:10.672
TALIESIN: Is there any meat matter around?

4563
03:06:10.672 --> 03:06:12.500
MATT: Make an investigation check.

4564
03:06:12.500 --> 03:06:14.432
TALIESIN: Never going to let me ever do a perception check.

4565
03:06:14.432 --> 03:06:17.938
MATT: I'll allow you to do perception for this, if you want.

4566
03:06:17.938 --> 03:06:19.378
TALIESIN: Thank god, because I rolled a two,

4567
03:06:19.378 --> 03:06:21.154
which means it's an 11.
MATT: 11.

4568
03:06:21.154 --> 03:06:25.175
Looking around, there's little strips of torn paper

4569
03:06:25.175 --> 03:06:27.234
scattered around the floor.

4570
03:06:27.234 --> 03:06:29.752
Look at it closer and it's not paper.

4571
03:06:29.752 --> 03:06:33.063
It's bits of skin that was torn

4572
03:06:33.063 --> 03:06:35.316
and has become a very frail leather.

4573
03:06:35.316 --> 03:06:37.183
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and turn it.

4574
03:06:37.183 --> 03:06:42.183
Does it feel like it's taking my spell to start a Decompose?

4575
03:06:42.432 --> 03:06:45.301
MATT: It does. It's resistant,

4576
03:06:45.301 --> 03:06:47.809
meaning there's an element,

4577
03:06:47.809 --> 03:06:50.100
in here, there's an inherent lack of moisture

4578
03:06:50.100 --> 03:06:52.779
compared to the previous chamber you were in.

4579
03:06:52.779 --> 03:06:55.220
TRAVIS: What about the ceiling of this place?

4580
03:06:55.220 --> 03:06:56.978
MATT: It's a very, very faint dome,

4581
03:06:56.978 --> 03:07:00.981
like not a huge dome, but a gradual

4582
03:07:00.981 --> 03:07:04.139
a concave top to it.

4583
03:07:04.139 --> 03:07:06.859
TRAVIS: Ballpark it, like 80, 60?

4584
03:07:06.859 --> 03:07:08.807
MATT: It's about 25, 30 feet up.

4585
03:07:08.807 --> 03:07:10.950
So not terribly high and not a huge...

4586
03:07:10.950 --> 03:07:12.989
SAM: Also, it's made of severed tongues.

4587
03:07:12.989 --> 03:07:14.711
MATT: Yeah, it's just--
TRAVIS: What about that rack

4588
03:07:14.711 --> 03:07:18.091
that was to the right of the entrance when we came in?

4589
03:07:18.091 --> 03:07:19.494
SAM: The rack?

4590
03:07:19.494 --> 03:07:21.400
MATT: It'd be at the left side of when you enter, yeah.

4591
03:07:21.400 --> 03:07:23.663
TALIESIN: All right, now I'm going to go.

4592
03:07:23.663 --> 03:07:25.194
MATT: Okay, you go ahead and look at it

4593
03:07:25.194 --> 03:07:27.006
and it's set up and there are

4594
03:07:27.006 --> 03:07:31.315
all sorts of torture implements,

4595
03:07:33.120 --> 03:07:37.484
spikes, hooks, tongs,

4596
03:07:37.484 --> 03:07:42.073
jagged blades, and small spikes.

4597
03:07:42.073 --> 03:07:46.298
It is a smorgasbord of very creative

4598
03:07:46.298 --> 03:07:49.139
tools and implements for all manner of

4599
03:07:49.139 --> 03:07:53.445
twisting, cutting, tearing, dragging, hooking,

4600
03:07:53.445 --> 03:07:55.970
piercing soft flesh.

4601
03:07:55.970 --> 03:07:57.820
LAURA: (sounds of disgust)

4602
03:07:57.820 --> 03:08:00.086
TRAVIS: Our hand size or larger?

4603
03:08:00.086 --> 03:08:03.084
Like tools that we would be able to wield?

4604
03:08:03.084 --> 03:08:06.051
MATT: They seem to vary.

4605
03:08:08.498 --> 03:08:10.329
MARISHA: That's a good question.
TRAVIS: Hey, Jester?

4606
03:08:10.329 --> 03:08:11.592
LAURA: Hm.
TRAVIS: I don't know

4607
03:08:11.592 --> 03:08:15.249
if you want to waste it, but you're not interested in

4608
03:08:15.249 --> 03:08:19.568
locating that individual we're chasing, do you?

4609
03:08:19.568 --> 03:08:20.401
LAURA: I mean.

4610
03:08:22.119 --> 03:08:23.535
TRAVIS: You don't have to.

4611
03:08:23.535 --> 03:08:25.018
TALIESIN: Just going to do this real quick.

4612
03:08:25.018 --> 03:08:26.628
ASHLEY: You said there's a door across the way?

4613
03:08:26.628 --> 03:08:28.298
MATT: Correct, across and to the left.

4614
03:08:28.298 --> 03:08:29.881
TRAVIS: A door?
TALIESIN: Oh, yay.

4615
03:08:33.228 --> 03:08:38.195
Everyone but Nott-- sorry, I can only do so many-- gets,

4616
03:08:41.136 --> 03:08:46.136
making sure I did this right, 18, 24 points of healing.

4617
03:08:46.186 --> 03:08:48.769
TRAVIS: That's huge right now.
MARISHA: Huge.

4618
03:08:50.251 --> 03:08:53.726
ASHLEY: Caleb, you looked at the--
TRAVIS: The pedestal?

4619
03:08:53.726 --> 03:08:54.934
ASHLEY: The altar thing?

4620
03:08:54.934 --> 03:08:56.078
Pedestal?

4621
03:08:56.078 --> 03:09:00.078
LIAM: There was nothing arcane in nature to it, but

4622
03:09:02.293 --> 03:09:06.120
does it look like the bowl at the top of this bird feeder

4623
03:09:06.120 --> 03:09:08.256
feeds into this spiral down,

4624
03:09:08.256 --> 03:09:10.488
like there's entryway for fluid

4625
03:09:10.488 --> 03:09:13.773
from the bowl to go into the grooves?

4626
03:09:13.773 --> 03:09:17.036
MATT: You look. It's possible.

4627
03:09:17.036 --> 03:09:19.529
The grooves move up, but they're not angled

4628
03:09:19.529 --> 03:09:22.920
for something to necessarily drip down into it

4629
03:09:22.920 --> 03:09:23.949
for any sort of fluid,

4630
03:09:23.949 --> 03:09:26.492
but they do seem, for the spirals here,

4631
03:09:26.492 --> 03:09:28.180
as they make their way to the top,

4632
03:09:28.180 --> 03:09:30.245
they tend to converge and then one goes

4633
03:09:30.245 --> 03:09:31.756
to each of these little bowls

4634
03:09:31.756 --> 03:09:34.924
and each bowl's about that big. It's about a double handful.

4635
03:09:34.924 --> 03:09:36.227
TRAVIS: Is it a flat platform?

4636
03:09:36.227 --> 03:09:37.527
MATT: It's a flat platform except for

4637
03:09:37.527 --> 03:09:40.786
those three little holes.

4638
03:09:40.786 --> 03:09:43.125
LIAM: Okay, are the bowls on top

4639
03:09:43.125 --> 03:09:45.057
or are they bowls cut into the--

4640
03:09:45.057 --> 03:09:48.200
MATT: No, they're cut in to the actual surface, yeah.

4641
03:09:48.200 --> 03:09:50.117
LAURA: I can try it.

4642
03:09:50.117 --> 03:09:52.727
It would use up one of my spells, but--

4643
03:09:52.727 --> 03:09:55.496
TRAVIS: Well, yeah, maybe not just yet.

4644
03:09:55.496 --> 03:09:57.657
Just took a look around, plus there's a door.

4645
03:09:57.657 --> 03:10:00.039
LIAM: Yeah, is the door sealed?

4646
03:10:00.039 --> 03:10:03.246
LAURA: Yes, a sealed door, yes.

4647
03:10:03.246 --> 03:10:05.997
TRAVIS: At the base of the platform, where the--

4648
03:10:05.997 --> 03:10:09.211
MATT: You don't see a top or bottom or any element to it.

4649
03:10:09.211 --> 03:10:12.714
TRAVIS: Where the floor meets the upstart of the platform

4650
03:10:12.714 --> 03:10:14.108
where the spirals are, does it look like

4651
03:10:14.108 --> 03:10:15.978
there's any room for it to move or rotate

4652
03:10:15.978 --> 03:10:17.837
or does it look fixed and steady?

4653
03:10:17.837 --> 03:10:20.337
MATT: Make an investigation check.

4654
03:10:23.707 --> 03:10:24.834
TRAVIS: 15.

4655
03:10:24.834 --> 03:10:26.095
MATT: 15, okay.

4656
03:10:26.095 --> 03:10:28.599
You go ahead and glance around the side.

4657
03:10:28.599 --> 03:10:31.305
It looks-- there isn't any sort of a line

4658
03:10:31.305 --> 03:10:34.581
that indicates an area where it would be able to move,

4659
03:10:34.581 --> 03:10:37.664
slide, or shift its current position.

4660
03:10:38.926 --> 03:10:42.031
Just from glancing and doing a little pass around.

4661
03:10:42.031 --> 03:10:44.889
MARISHA: Does it look like there's any mechanisms

4662
03:10:44.889 --> 03:10:47.522
around? Anything?

4663
03:10:47.522 --> 03:10:48.696
MATT: Make a perception check.
LAURA: Yeah, there's a

4664
03:10:48.696 --> 03:10:49.985
bowl in the middle of the room.

4665
03:10:49.985 --> 03:10:51.949
TALIESIN: I'll join you in that perception check.

4666
03:10:51.949 --> 03:10:52.800
MATT: Okay.

4667
03:10:52.800 --> 03:10:54.810
MARISHA: Not investigation?

4668
03:10:54.810 --> 03:10:56.699
MATT: Not if you're looking around.

4669
03:10:56.699 --> 03:11:00.456
Are you going to do a slow pass of feeling for openings?

4670
03:11:00.456 --> 03:11:01.554
Is that what you want to try for?

4671
03:11:01.554 --> 03:11:02.548
TRAVIS: Or are you just doing the pedestal?

4672
03:11:02.548 --> 03:11:05.460
MARISHA: No, I'm looking for levers--

4673
03:11:05.460 --> 03:11:07.880
MATT: On the pedestal.
MARISHA: Buttons around the pedestal.

4674
03:11:07.880 --> 03:11:09.892
MATT: Okay, so you and Fjord are both doing that.

4675
03:11:09.892 --> 03:11:13.445
MATT: All right, I'll say make an investigation check.

4676
03:11:13.445 --> 03:11:15.488
LAURA: I'm keeping an eye on the dead people.

4677
03:11:15.488 --> 03:11:17.913
TALIESIN: Oh! A Natural 20 for a 29.

4678
03:11:18.787 --> 03:11:20.120
MATT: That's pretty slick.

4679
03:11:21.264 --> 03:11:22.097
Okay.

4680
03:11:24.127 --> 03:11:27.104
The chains are affixed to the wall.

4681
03:11:27.104 --> 03:11:29.126
TALIESIN: In grooves, I know, are obviously feeding.

4682
03:11:29.126 --> 03:11:32.024
MATT: To some degree.

4683
03:11:32.024 --> 03:11:34.586
TRAVIS: Chains are ceiling to the wall?

4684
03:11:34.586 --> 03:11:35.998
MATT: No, they're affixed to the wall

4685
03:11:35.998 --> 03:11:37.847
and dangling loosely and there are some loops

4686
03:11:37.847 --> 03:11:39.194
that are hanging from it

4687
03:11:39.194 --> 03:11:44.111
and there are open manacles at the end of them.

4688
03:11:45.069 --> 03:11:46.482
You are--
MARISHA: 25.

4689
03:11:46.482 --> 03:11:50.005
MATT: 25, so you look along the pillar

4690
03:11:50.005 --> 03:11:54.613
and feel for any sort of switches or anything.

4691
03:11:54.613 --> 03:11:59.496
You don't notice anything that is pullable

4692
03:11:59.496 --> 03:12:01.637
or pressable or anything.

4693
03:12:02.706 --> 03:12:05.429
As you stand up and look over the top of it

4694
03:12:05.429 --> 03:12:07.215
and put your hands on the front top of the table,

4695
03:12:07.215 --> 03:12:11.952
it shifts down, ever-so-slightly, like an inch.

4696
03:12:11.952 --> 03:12:13.481
You pull back.

4697
03:12:13.481 --> 03:12:18.481
You are appearing around, looking. You see something shift

4698
03:12:18.757 --> 03:12:23.757
in the pile below. You see a hand flop over.

4699
03:12:23.829 --> 03:12:25.122
You see, pushing from underneath--

4700
03:12:25.122 --> 03:12:28.819
TALIESIN: We've got a problem.
MATT: (undead moaning)

4701
03:12:28.819 --> 03:12:30.723
MATT: I'll be right back.
TALIESIN: I immediately--

4702
03:12:30.723 --> 03:12:31.922
(shouting)

4703
03:12:31.922 --> 03:12:33.960
TRAVIS: No, don't leave!
SAM: Oh, no.

4704
03:12:33.960 --> 03:12:35.390
ASHLEY: No, stay!

4705
03:12:35.390 --> 03:12:37.670
SAM: This battle camera!

4706
03:12:37.670 --> 03:12:39.227
Again.

4707
03:12:39.227 --> 03:12:40.227
MARISHA: Oh!
LAURA: Whoo.

4708
03:12:41.065 --> 03:12:42.482
MARISHA: Deflect missiles!

4709
03:12:44.124 --> 03:12:47.083
(shouting and clapping)
ASHLEY: That's good.

4710
03:12:47.083 --> 03:12:50.539
SAM: That move was brought to you by Dwarven Forge.

4711
03:12:50.539 --> 03:12:53.022
Check out their PDF, Dungeon--
MATT: A portion

4712
03:12:53.022 --> 03:12:57.180
of the floor suddenly open up.
SAM: On Dwarven Forge.

4713
03:12:57.180 --> 03:12:58.953
Why is it such a cool color?

4714
03:12:58.953 --> 03:13:00.067
Did you paint that?
TRAVIS: Look at the fucking

4715
03:13:00.067 --> 03:13:03.203
grappling hooks.
MATT: I used these last campaign.

4716
03:13:03.203 --> 03:13:04.846
LAURA: Ew.
SAM: You did?

4717
03:13:04.846 --> 03:13:07.131
LAURA: Yes.
SAM: Are they dripping with blood?

4718
03:13:07.131 --> 03:13:09.170
TRAVIS: They're dripping with goo.

4719
03:13:09.170 --> 03:13:11.391
ASHLEY: We came in that door over there?

4720
03:13:11.391 --> 03:13:12.366
MATT: You came in through this door.

4721
03:13:12.366 --> 03:13:15.204
SAM: They're dripping with boysenberry jelly.

4722
03:13:15.204 --> 03:13:17.189
MATT: You guys can place yourselves where you like

4723
03:13:17.189 --> 03:13:19.110
based on where you were.

4724
03:13:19.110 --> 03:13:22.685
TRAVIS: Are those bars that have been ripped open?

4725
03:13:22.685 --> 03:13:24.897
MATT: Well, at the point of that thing shifting

4726
03:13:24.897 --> 03:13:26.535
and the movement happening,

4727
03:13:26.535 --> 03:13:28.614
you now, on the floor, there's a section

4728
03:13:28.614 --> 03:13:30.897
where it-- iron area

4729
03:13:30.897 --> 03:13:32.801
(whooshes) opens up a bit

4730
03:13:32.801 --> 03:13:34.340
and bends and you can see things

4731
03:13:34.340 --> 03:13:36.285
starting to crawl their way out as well.

4732
03:13:36.285 --> 03:13:37.755
LAURA: Mm-hm.
SAM: Can we get out of here?

4733
03:13:37.755 --> 03:13:38.801
LIAM: These are new, right?

4734
03:13:38.801 --> 03:13:41.804
These are where we are originally seeing bodies down?

4735
03:13:41.804 --> 03:13:43.205
MATT: No, these were closed.

4736
03:13:43.205 --> 03:13:44.661
These are the slopes going down.

4737
03:13:44.661 --> 03:13:46.313
LIAM: These are what we saw and these just opened up?

4738
03:13:46.313 --> 03:13:47.815
MATT: Where you see it gets dark around the edges. Because I

4739
03:13:47.815 --> 03:13:49.378
couldn't find slopes. Starts behind there

4740
03:13:49.378 --> 03:13:51.855
and gradually heads down underneath this slot.

4741
03:13:51.855 --> 03:13:54.902
LIAM: Okay.
ASHLEY: I'm going to get in-between

4742
03:13:54.902 --> 03:13:57.972
Fjord and Caduceus, actually, on the other side, yeah.

4743
03:13:57.972 --> 03:13:58.978
MATT: You got it.

4744
03:13:58.978 --> 03:14:01.051
SAM: We entered from the doorway closest to you?

4745
03:14:01.051 --> 03:14:02.192
MATT: Entered from this door.
SAM: Okay.

4746
03:14:02.192 --> 03:14:04.052
MATT: Which has slammed shut.

4747
03:14:04.052 --> 03:14:05.295
TRAVIS: Oh, good.

4748
03:14:05.295 --> 03:14:07.228
LIAM: You said these opened up?

4749
03:14:07.228 --> 03:14:09.112
MATT: Correct.

4750
03:14:09.112 --> 03:14:10.878
LAURA: Jesus. (frustrated noise)

4751
03:14:11.940 --> 03:14:14.955
Look at these chains on the wall. It looks so cool, Matt.

4752
03:14:14.955 --> 03:14:15.788
TRAVIS: It really is.

4753
03:14:15.788 --> 03:14:17.879
ASHLEY: This is very cool.

4754
03:14:17.879 --> 03:14:18.712
LAURA: No!

4755
03:14:24.927 --> 03:14:27.177
MATT: Then you arrive here.

4756
03:14:28.846 --> 03:14:30.179
Oh, all right.

4757
03:14:36.664 --> 03:14:37.831
SAM: Oh, so many.

4758
03:14:38.735 --> 03:14:40.652
Oh so many.
MATT: All right.

4759
03:14:42.802 --> 03:14:46.619
So for initiative here, we'll say...

4760
03:14:47.932 --> 03:14:50.658
Everyone roll initiative.
LIAM: Holy crud.

4761
03:14:50.658 --> 03:14:52.363
MATT: As now these corpses are starting

4762
03:14:52.363 --> 03:14:54.575
to drag their way out of the pile,

4763
03:14:54.575 --> 03:14:56.980
not all of them at once. Ones are starting to

4764
03:14:56.980 --> 03:14:58.523
start shifting and moving.

4765
03:14:58.523 --> 03:15:00.685
TRAVIS: This is the worst night of initiative.

4766
03:15:00.685 --> 03:15:01.518
MATT: 25 to 20.

4767
03:15:02.909 --> 03:15:05.595
ASHLEY: Natural 20.
SAM: Holy shit!

4768
03:15:05.595 --> 03:15:06.835
LAURA: 22.
SAM: Ashley's initiative.

4769
03:15:06.835 --> 03:15:08.888
ASHLEY: I mean.
SAM: On fire.

4770
03:15:08.888 --> 03:15:11.588
MATT: 22.
LAURA: 22.

4771
03:15:11.588 --> 03:15:12.604
MARISHA: Making up for five years.

4772
03:15:12.604 --> 03:15:14.114
MATT: What was your total?

4773
03:15:14.114 --> 03:15:16.394
ASHLEY: 22.
MATT: 22 for both of you.

4774
03:15:16.394 --> 03:15:18.039
ASHLEY: Yeah.
LAURA: Nice.

4775
03:15:18.039 --> 03:15:19.916
MATT: All righty.

4776
03:15:19.916 --> 03:15:21.898
20 to 15?
MARISHA: 18.

4777
03:15:21.898 --> 03:15:23.648
TALIESIN: 15.
MATT: 15, all right.

4778
03:15:27.619 --> 03:15:29.507
All right, 15 to ten.

4779
03:15:29.507 --> 03:15:31.057
LIAM: 12.
MATT: 12.

4780
03:15:35.724 --> 03:15:36.807
Ten to five.

4781
03:15:37.674 --> 03:15:40.510
SAM: Natural one for a six.
MATT: (laughs)

4782
03:15:40.510 --> 03:15:41.343
TALIESIN: Get it out of the way now.

4783
03:15:41.343 --> 03:15:42.817
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4784
03:15:42.817 --> 03:15:44.300
TALIESIN: Good, we've got clerics at the top.

4785
03:15:44.300 --> 03:15:45.939
TRAVIS: Damn, that is--
LIAM: God.

4786
03:15:45.939 --> 03:15:47.616
TRAVIS: Second for the bottom of two bottoms.

4787
03:15:47.616 --> 03:15:48.570
MATT: Yasha, you're up first.

4788
03:15:48.570 --> 03:15:51.944
You watch as the sections in the ground that opened up.

4789
03:15:51.944 --> 03:15:56.761
Suddenly these dry-- their skin wrinkled and torn,

4790
03:15:56.761 --> 03:15:58.778
like they had been-- all moisture

4791
03:15:58.778 --> 03:16:00.373
in the body had been siphoned out of it,

4792
03:16:00.373 --> 03:16:02.153
so there's cracking and tearing sounds.

4793
03:16:02.153 --> 03:16:05.646
The bones scrape and pull against the outer shell.

4794
03:16:05.646 --> 03:16:07.064
You can see, as one of them reaches up,

4795
03:16:07.064 --> 03:16:09.781
the skin actually tears past the fingers and the bones

4796
03:16:09.781 --> 03:16:12.297
reach out of them, like they're breaking out of

4797
03:16:12.297 --> 03:16:14.567
some sort of a paper bag.

4798
03:16:14.567 --> 03:16:17.713
It's a disturbing type of zombie sight,

4799
03:16:17.713 --> 03:16:21.394
but you see there are five of them right now that are

4800
03:16:21.394 --> 03:16:23.982
emerging out of the nearby body clusters.

4801
03:16:23.982 --> 03:16:25.631
ASHLEY: Oh, hey.
SAM: Body clusters?

4802
03:16:25.631 --> 03:16:26.589
TRAVIS: I'm tired of this audition.

4803
03:16:26.589 --> 03:16:29.003
We passed the test, right? (nervous fake laugh)

4804
03:16:29.003 --> 03:16:31.883
MATT: What are you doing, Yasha, Jester? You guys are up.

4805
03:16:31.883 --> 03:16:33.633
ASHLEY: Do you want to go?
SAM: Go smash some heads.

4806
03:16:33.633 --> 03:16:35.794
LAURA: Sure.
ASHLEY: Or do you need a second?

4807
03:16:35.794 --> 03:16:37.540
LAURA: No, I know what I'm going to do.

4808
03:16:37.540 --> 03:16:41.847
I'm going to step forward just a little bit.

4809
03:16:41.847 --> 03:16:44.136
MATT: All righty, this way?
LAURA: Yeah.

4810
03:16:44.136 --> 03:16:47.028
I'm going to search on my belt

4811
03:16:47.028 --> 03:16:49.357
and I'm going to hold up the symbol of the Traveler

4812
03:16:49.357 --> 03:16:53.038
and I'm going to go: I hope you are here with us right now,

4813
03:16:53.038 --> 03:16:57.992
please protect us! And I'm going to cast Turn Undead.

4814
03:16:57.992 --> 03:16:59.906
MATT: Turn Undead.
ASHLEY: Holy fuck.

4815
03:16:59.906 --> 03:17:01.097
MATT: All right.

4816
03:17:01.097 --> 03:17:02.963
TRAVIS: ♪ Get it cleric, get it get it cleric. ♪

4817
03:17:02.963 --> 03:17:05.677
♪ Get it cleric, get it get it cleric. ♪

4818
03:17:05.677 --> 03:17:09.577
LAURA: Anything has to make a wisdom saving throw.

4819
03:17:09.577 --> 03:17:13.935
Any undead I see or hear within 30 feet of me.

4820
03:17:13.935 --> 03:17:15.143
MATT: Correct.
ASHLEY: Ooh, I'm so glad

4821
03:17:15.143 --> 03:17:17.087
you went first.

4822
03:17:17.087 --> 03:17:18.656
SAM: And what do we undead have to roll?

4823
03:17:18.656 --> 03:17:20.264
MATT: These, technically, are a

4824
03:17:20.264 --> 03:17:22.432
challenge rating of one-fourth.

4825
03:17:22.432 --> 03:17:25.928
TALIESIN: Challenge level one?
MATT: They're under that.

4826
03:17:25.928 --> 03:17:26.777
LAURA: Oh!

4827
03:17:26.777 --> 03:17:28.478
MATT: So it becomes Destroy Undead.

4828
03:17:28.478 --> 03:17:31.544
TRAVIS: Oh, shit!
MARISHA: Again!

4829
03:17:32.625 --> 03:17:34.416
MATT: Your DC for your spell is?

4830
03:17:34.416 --> 03:17:35.249
LAURA: 17.

4831
03:17:35.249 --> 03:17:36.399
MATT: That's wisdom, right?

4832
03:17:36.399 --> 03:17:38.791
LAURA: Yes.
TRAVIS: Come on. Come on now.

4833
03:17:40.181 --> 03:17:42.819
(whooshes)
(cheering)

4834
03:17:42.819 --> 03:17:44.699
TRAVIS: Come on.
MARISHA: Fuck that shit up.

4835
03:17:44.699 --> 03:17:46.884
(cheering)

4836
03:17:46.884 --> 03:17:48.365
TRAVIS: Come on.
SAM: No whammies, no whammies,

4837
03:17:48.365 --> 03:17:49.944
no whammies, no whammies!
(whooshing)

4838
03:17:49.944 --> 03:17:51.902
(shouting)

4839
03:17:51.902 --> 03:17:52.735
(die rolling)

4840
03:17:54.167 --> 03:17:55.440
MARISHA: No!

4841
03:17:55.440 --> 03:17:56.598
I'm greedy! I need it all.

4842
03:17:56.598 --> 03:17:57.431
MATT: Fine.

4843
03:17:57.431 --> 03:17:58.860
(groaning)

4844
03:17:58.860 --> 03:18:01.033
MARISHA: That was awesome!

4845
03:18:01.033 --> 03:18:02.691
MATT: All righty. Let me check one thing

4846
03:18:02.691 --> 03:18:06.191
real fast here, while we're on the topic.

4847
03:18:09.955 --> 03:18:11.572
Yep, all right, cool.

4848
03:18:11.572 --> 03:18:14.751
Those three just scatter into ash

4849
03:18:14.751 --> 03:18:16.869
(whooshes) across the way.

4850
03:18:16.869 --> 03:18:19.148
That's your turn. That was your action, at least.

4851
03:18:19.148 --> 03:18:20.504
You have a little bit of movement still

4852
03:18:20.504 --> 03:18:21.950
if you want to go.

4853
03:18:21.950 --> 03:18:24.883
LAURA: I'm going to-- oh, gosh.

4854
03:18:26.109 --> 03:18:28.329
Yeah, I'm going to keep walking through

4855
03:18:28.329 --> 03:18:31.020
and I'm going to come and sit here if I can make it.

4856
03:18:33.234 --> 03:18:34.067
MATT: Out of 30.
LAURA: Yeah.

4857
03:18:34.067 --> 03:18:34.900
MATT: Moving right there.

4858
03:18:34.900 --> 03:18:35.825
LAURA: That's where I'm going to stand.

4859
03:18:35.825 --> 03:18:37.161
MATT: All right, you got it.

4860
03:18:37.161 --> 03:18:38.576
Yasha.
ASHLEY: I, so--

4861
03:18:38.576 --> 03:18:40.617
I'm going to make my way over to that one over there

4862
03:18:40.617 --> 03:18:42.388
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: ♪ Making my way-- ♪

4863
03:18:42.388 --> 03:18:45.923
TRAVIS: Stop it!
SAM: (vocalizing)

4864
03:18:45.923 --> 03:18:47.903
ASHLEY: ♪ Making my way to it, pulling my sword ♪

4865
03:18:47.903 --> 03:18:49.374
MATT: Which one?
ASHLEY: Say again?

4866
03:18:49.374 --> 03:18:51.592
MATT: Which weapon?
ASHLEY: Magician's Judge.

4867
03:18:51.592 --> 03:18:53.592
MATT: Magician's Judge, out.

4868
03:18:54.434 --> 03:18:56.213
TALIESIN: Oh, no we did not.

4869
03:18:56.213 --> 03:18:59.193
ASHLEY: I'm going to go for an attack.

4870
03:18:59.193 --> 03:19:00.610
MATT: Go for it, first strike.

4871
03:19:00.610 --> 03:19:02.637
Are you raging, at first?

4872
03:19:02.637 --> 03:19:04.366
ASHLEY: Uh-huh.
MATT: All right.

4873
03:19:04.366 --> 03:19:05.353
Got to remember to--
ASHLEY: Sorry, I'm sorry--

4874
03:19:05.353 --> 03:19:07.415
MATT: It's all good.

4875
03:19:07.415 --> 03:19:09.778
ASHLEY: Reckless.
MATT: Go for it.

4876
03:19:09.778 --> 03:19:11.307
With advantage.
ASHLEY: Might as well.

4877
03:19:11.307 --> 03:19:13.539
Okay, let me mark this.

4878
03:19:13.539 --> 03:19:14.907
MATT: Do you have a question, Caleb?

4879
03:19:14.907 --> 03:19:16.538
LIAM: How deep do those things go?

4880
03:19:16.538 --> 03:19:19.814
MATT: From what you can see, they go past the edge,

4881
03:19:19.814 --> 03:19:24.744
in darkness, and that's about ten feet, down at the edge,

4882
03:19:24.744 --> 03:19:26.554
and it continues below, but you don't know

4883
03:19:26.554 --> 03:19:28.153
how deep it goes because the body just becomes--

4884
03:19:28.153 --> 03:19:30.522
TALIESIN: It lit up to 60 feet when I did it, though.

4885
03:19:30.522 --> 03:19:31.647
MATT: Correct.
TALIESIN: Yeah, so.

4886
03:19:31.647 --> 03:19:35.432
LAURA: Were they all undead on the slopes down?

4887
03:19:35.432 --> 03:19:37.959
MATT: They all had a very, very faint bit of--

4888
03:19:37.959 --> 03:19:40.015
LAURA: Would they have gone (explosions) all the way

4889
03:19:40.015 --> 03:19:42.063
down the slopes, then, if I?

4890
03:19:42.063 --> 03:19:42.930
MATT: What's the range on that, the radius?

4891
03:19:42.930 --> 03:19:43.990
LAURA: 30 feet.

4892
03:19:43.990 --> 03:19:45.360
MATT: 30 feet.
LIAM: Popcorn.

4893
03:19:45.360 --> 03:19:47.301
(popping)

4894
03:19:47.301 --> 03:19:48.235
MATT: You get a few on that side.

4895
03:19:48.235 --> 03:19:51.268
Here, I'll post-- that's a good point.

4896
03:19:52.252 --> 03:19:56.992
Okay, three over there, just disintegrate.

4897
03:19:56.992 --> 03:19:58.075
On that side,

4898
03:20:01.514 --> 03:20:04.139
(laughs) seven more go (booming)

4899
03:20:04.139 --> 03:20:05.649
(shouting)

4900
03:20:05.649 --> 03:20:06.645
MATT: Scattered out on those ends.

4901
03:20:06.645 --> 03:20:08.629
ASHLEY: That is so cool!
TRAVIS: Destroyed.

4902
03:20:08.629 --> 03:20:10.235
ASHLEY: Yes!

4903
03:20:10.235 --> 03:20:14.314
MATT: As they're scattered to dust on those sides,

4904
03:20:14.314 --> 03:20:16.017
Caduceus, you watch this happen

4905
03:20:16.017 --> 03:20:17.647
and you glance down. Where one of them scatters to dust,

4906
03:20:17.647 --> 03:20:19.305
you see this faint,

4907
03:20:19.305 --> 03:20:22.980
glowing bit of matter,

4908
03:20:22.980 --> 03:20:26.185
just (slurps) onto the ground amongst the pile

4909
03:20:26.185 --> 03:20:28.654
and vanish into the undead pile below.

4910
03:20:30.696 --> 03:20:32.325
TRAVIS: Eat that shit.

4911
03:20:32.325 --> 03:20:33.903
MATT: You saw it real fast out of the corner of your eye.

4912
03:20:33.903 --> 03:20:37.059
Just the little thing, as the ash scattered away,

4913
03:20:37.059 --> 03:20:38.927
something was left behind in the space of it

4914
03:20:38.927 --> 03:20:40.871
and fell.
LAURA: A piece of gold.

4915
03:20:40.871 --> 03:20:42.812
It was an enchanted something!

4916
03:20:42.812 --> 03:20:44.611
It's a magical item. We need to get it.

4917
03:20:44.611 --> 03:20:46.600
MATT: All right.
ASHLEY: 23 to hit.

4918
03:20:46.600 --> 03:20:49.009
MATT: 23 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

4919
03:20:50.179 --> 03:20:53.453
LIAM: Give me a reason not to loot everything I see.

4920
03:20:53.453 --> 03:20:55.933
TRAVIS: Do not do that.

4921
03:20:55.933 --> 03:20:56.918
Kill us all.
LIAM: I know, but--

4922
03:20:56.918 --> 03:20:59.542
ASHLEY: 18 points of damage--

4923
03:20:59.542 --> 03:21:00.493
MATT: 18 points of damage.

4924
03:21:00.493 --> 03:21:02.358
You slash through!

4925
03:21:02.358 --> 03:21:04.659
Carving through its body, you see the muscles tear open

4926
03:21:04.659 --> 03:21:07.088
and it's like dried tendons

4927
03:21:07.088 --> 03:21:08.073
and the muscles are gray

4928
03:21:08.073 --> 03:21:10.068
and retract on the inside

4929
03:21:10.068 --> 03:21:12.082
with the strains it (squeaks) squeaking sound

4930
03:21:12.082 --> 03:21:16.195
and it's still standing there in front of you.

4931
03:21:16.195 --> 03:21:18.629
ASHLEY: I'll hit it again.
MATT: All right.

4932
03:21:18.629 --> 03:21:21.897
With advantage because you're reckless.

4933
03:21:21.897 --> 03:21:23.443
ASHLEY: Come on, this thing rolls bad.

4934
03:21:23.443 --> 03:21:26.121
Okay, good, roll it again.

4935
03:21:26.121 --> 03:21:27.755
Oh, wow, okay.

4936
03:21:29.157 --> 03:21:29.990
Eight.

4937
03:21:29.990 --> 03:21:32.578
MATT: Eight hits.
ASHLEY: It does?

4938
03:21:32.578 --> 03:21:33.653
MATT: Yes.

4939
03:21:33.653 --> 03:21:35.905
ASHLEY: Okay.
TALIESIN: They're slow.

4940
03:21:35.905 --> 03:21:39.409
MATT: Low armor class.
MARISHA: How'd you roll so crappy?

4941
03:21:39.409 --> 03:21:41.011
ASHLEY: know, I rolled a one and a two.

4942
03:21:41.011 --> 03:21:42.902
MARISHA: (sympathetic noises)

4943
03:21:42.902 --> 03:21:45.502
ASHLEY: Okay, seven. I know, that die.

4944
03:21:45.502 --> 03:21:47.327
It rolls cocked so much.

4945
03:21:48.235 --> 03:21:49.743
Okay, seven...

4946
03:21:51.386 --> 03:21:54.027
MARISHA: Oh, I can't--
ASHLEY: 12 points of damage.

4947
03:21:54.027 --> 03:21:56.478
MATT: 12 points of damage.

4948
03:21:56.478 --> 03:21:59.934
Okay, you slash through and down its chest

4949
03:21:59.934 --> 03:22:03.032
and it (groans). It's a death blow.

4950
03:22:03.032 --> 03:22:07.138
(moaning) It stays back, standing again.

4951
03:22:07.138 --> 03:22:08.471
TRAVIS: Uh oh, uh oh.
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.

4952
03:22:08.471 --> 03:22:12.684
MATT: It's fucked up, but that should have killed it, but

4953
03:22:12.684 --> 03:22:14.629
fuck, this thing is still standing.

4954
03:22:14.629 --> 03:22:16.481
That finishes your turn, Yasha.

4955
03:22:16.481 --> 03:22:18.494
Jester's done. Beau, you're up.

4956
03:22:18.494 --> 03:22:20.994
SAM: Beau.
MARISHA: Okay.

4957
03:22:20.994 --> 03:22:23.369
LIAM: (silly voice) Beauregard, Beauregard.

4958
03:22:24.505 --> 03:22:28.830
MARISHA: There's one over here, in the pit?

4959
03:22:28.830 --> 03:22:30.438
MATT: There is one in the pit here, yes.

4960
03:22:30.438 --> 03:22:33.521
MARISHA: Then one just ran off of Yasha.

4961
03:22:35.984 --> 03:22:37.957
LIAM: Ermahgerd, Beauregard.

4962
03:22:37.957 --> 03:22:40.787
LAURA: (laughs)
MARISHA: Can I

4963
03:22:40.787 --> 03:22:45.367
do some dope monk shit and jump over the pit

4964
03:22:45.367 --> 03:22:47.694
and get behind the other guy?

4965
03:22:47.694 --> 03:22:49.445
MATT: You can jump over here. He's 10 feet below,

4966
03:22:49.445 --> 03:22:51.349
so he's not within range if you're there, though.

4967
03:22:51.349 --> 03:22:53.599
MARISHA: Oh.
LIAM: Well, that changes things.

4968
03:22:53.599 --> 03:22:55.037
MATT: Yeah, he's below.
MARISHA: That does change things.

4969
03:22:55.037 --> 03:22:56.302
MATT: You would know that, so if you don't want to do that.

4970
03:22:56.302 --> 03:22:58.886
MARISHA: I'll go fuck up the one that's on Yasha.

4971
03:22:58.886 --> 03:23:00.528
MATT: All right.
ASHLEY: Hell yeah.

4972
03:23:01.403 --> 03:23:03.850
MATT: You rush around, staff at the ready.

4973
03:23:03.850 --> 03:23:07.047
Make your attacks.
MARISHA: A pop pop.

4974
03:23:07.047 --> 03:23:10.363
Okay, well, one is a two.

4975
03:23:10.363 --> 03:23:11.829
Oh, well, that's 12, though.

4976
03:23:11.829 --> 03:23:12.908
MATT: That hits.
MARISHA: 12 hits.

4977
03:23:12.908 --> 03:23:15.820
Then the second one is 18.
MATT: That hits.

4978
03:23:15.820 --> 03:23:17.403
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay.

4979
03:23:18.621 --> 03:23:19.977
Fuck.

4980
03:23:19.977 --> 03:23:24.977
Okay, first one is 13 points of damage.

4981
03:23:25.497 --> 03:23:26.967
MATT: All righty.

4982
03:23:26.967 --> 03:23:30.468
MARISHA: Second one--
MATT: It (impact sound)

4983
03:23:30.468 --> 03:23:32.244
stays standing.
MARISHA: Ah!

4984
03:23:32.244 --> 03:23:33.628
MATT: Next attack.
MARISHA: Nine points of damage.

4985
03:23:33.628 --> 03:23:34.722
TRAVIS: Did you just throat punch him?

4986
03:23:34.722 --> 03:23:36.451
MARISHA: Yeah, I take my staff and I just go

4987
03:23:36.451 --> 03:23:38.351
guh through his throat.

4988
03:23:38.351 --> 03:23:40.976
MATT: It like (gurgles).

4989
03:23:40.976 --> 03:23:42.390
It's still standing.
MARISHA: Ah!

4990
03:23:42.390 --> 03:23:43.803
MATT: Each of these blows

4991
03:23:43.803 --> 03:23:45.572
should be killing it, but it's not going down.

4992
03:23:45.572 --> 03:23:48.355
MARISHA: I shake it and--

4993
03:23:48.355 --> 03:23:49.377
Get it off!

4994
03:23:49.377 --> 03:23:52.097
Get it off!
ASHLEY: (laughs)

4995
03:23:52.097 --> 03:23:53.682
It's stuck.
MARISHA: (yells)

4996
03:23:53.682 --> 03:23:54.729
MATT: I'm going to try and kick it off.

4997
03:23:54.729 --> 03:23:57.465
TRAVIS: It's going (groans).
MARISHA: No!

4998
03:23:57.465 --> 03:24:00.439
LIAM: Less method acting, less method acting, please!

4999
03:24:00.439 --> 03:24:02.113
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and position myself

5000
03:24:02.113 --> 03:24:05.018
between the altar and the door.

5001
03:24:05.018 --> 03:24:06.311
MATT: Over here?
TALIESIN: Yeah,

5002
03:24:06.311 --> 03:24:08.294
right in the middle, between the altar and the door.

5003
03:24:08.294 --> 03:24:10.742
MATT: Okay, right there?
TALIESIN: No, a little,

5004
03:24:10.742 --> 03:24:13.643
two towards me, like there.

5005
03:24:13.643 --> 03:24:16.130
Wait, that door down there is open, isn't it?

5006
03:24:16.130 --> 03:24:16.963
LAURA: Uh-huh.

5007
03:24:18.022 --> 03:24:20.186
TALIESIN: Okay.

5008
03:24:20.186 --> 03:24:22.040
I'm going to take one step away from him.

5009
03:24:22.040 --> 03:24:24.390
I'm going to be right in front of-- yeah, right there.

5010
03:24:24.390 --> 03:24:26.717
Ah, fuck it, and them I'm going to use a Sacred Flame

5011
03:24:26.717 --> 03:24:28.939
to hit the one that the two of them are fighting.

5012
03:24:28.939 --> 03:24:30.163
MATT: Okay.

5013
03:24:30.163 --> 03:24:31.903
TALIESIN: To see if some radiant damage does that.

5014
03:24:31.903 --> 03:24:33.674
MATT: You got it, all right. Is that a dex save?

5015
03:24:33.674 --> 03:24:34.960
TALIESIN: Yep.

5016
03:24:34.960 --> 03:24:36.587
MATT: That is a seven.
TALIESIN: Nope.

5017
03:24:36.587 --> 03:24:38.028
MATT: So go ahead and roll damage.

5018
03:24:38.028 --> 03:24:38.945
TALIESIN: That's a--

5019
03:24:41.591 --> 03:24:44.747
for fun, that's 12 points radiant damage.

5020
03:24:44.747 --> 03:24:45.597
MATT: You got it.

5021
03:24:45.597 --> 03:24:47.423
As it's on the edge of Beau's staff,

5022
03:24:47.423 --> 03:24:50.363
jammed through the middle of the throat, it's like (groans)

5023
03:24:50.363 --> 03:24:52.141
reaching for her and then (whooshes)

5024
03:24:52.141 --> 03:24:54.904
it burns, incinerates, and falls to the ground, crumbling.

5025
03:24:54.904 --> 03:24:56.451
There's a pile of burnt bones.

5026
03:24:56.451 --> 03:24:58.348
TALIESIN: I'm going to use my bonus action to say:

5027
03:24:58.348 --> 03:25:00.223
You know, I think radiant damage

5028
03:25:00.223 --> 03:25:02.927
is going to be the thing, so if you're not

5029
03:25:02.927 --> 03:25:04.237
blessed with some sort of god,

5030
03:25:04.237 --> 03:25:06.827
maybe you could figure out how to get us out of here.

5031
03:25:06.827 --> 03:25:09.104
MATT: You watch as it disintegrates, too,

5032
03:25:09.104 --> 03:25:11.032
because it's still standing over the hole.

5033
03:25:11.032 --> 03:25:13.416
Its body crumples into ash and this faint, little

5034
03:25:13.416 --> 03:25:15.443
glowing thing in its chest

5035
03:25:15.443 --> 03:25:16.776
falls into the hole below it.

5036
03:25:16.776 --> 03:25:18.394
MARISHA: The fuck is that?
LAURA: Grab it!

5037
03:25:18.394 --> 03:25:21.332
MARISHA: Can I?
SAM: It's controlling them all.

5038
03:25:21.332 --> 03:25:23.707
MATT: I'd say--
MARISHA: I haven't used

5039
03:25:23.707 --> 03:25:26.657
my bonus action or my reaction.

5040
03:25:26.657 --> 03:25:27.565
MATT: But you've got to hold an action to be ready

5041
03:25:27.565 --> 03:25:28.916
for something like that.
MARISHA: Okay.

5042
03:25:28.916 --> 03:25:30.466
MATT: Sorry.

5043
03:25:30.466 --> 03:25:32.213
LAURA: Is it like missile-snaring, though?

5044
03:25:32.213 --> 03:25:35.316
MARISHA: I was trying to, you know, but.

5045
03:25:35.316 --> 03:25:38.115
MATT: Give me a--

5046
03:25:38.115 --> 03:25:40.590
give me a dexterity check with disadvantage.

5047
03:25:40.590 --> 03:25:42.554
MARISHA: Come on, okay, okay.

5048
03:25:42.554 --> 03:25:44.537
TALIESIN: Either way, it was worth asking.

5049
03:25:44.537 --> 03:25:47.359
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil!

5050
03:25:47.359 --> 03:25:49.493
A natural 20!
SAM: With disadvantage.

5051
03:25:49.493 --> 03:25:50.326
MARISHA: Oh.

5052
03:25:50.326 --> 03:25:53.777
TRAVIS: Was this the other one?
MARISHA: Yeah, it was.

5053
03:25:53.777 --> 03:25:56.528
Man, I had-- I celebrated too soon.

5054
03:25:56.528 --> 03:25:59.592
(laughter)
MATT: But you rolled one!

5055
03:25:59.592 --> 03:26:01.274
That's it.
MARISHA: 17, 17!

5056
03:26:01.274 --> 03:26:03.541
MATT: 17. You reach out and catch it.

5057
03:26:03.541 --> 03:26:06.274
You look for a second.

5058
03:26:06.274 --> 03:26:08.702
It's the heart of the creature.

5059
03:26:08.702 --> 03:26:10.505
It squishes in your hand, but it also

5060
03:26:10.505 --> 03:26:13.102
cracks a little bit. It's super dry,

5061
03:26:13.102 --> 03:26:15.304
but it has this faint warmth to it

5062
03:26:15.304 --> 03:26:18.369
and it's just sitting there in your hand

5063
03:26:18.369 --> 03:26:20.830
with this very, very, very pale glow.

5064
03:26:20.830 --> 03:26:22.039
MARISHA: Okay.

5065
03:26:22.039 --> 03:26:22.980
ASHLEY: Put it in the bowl.

5066
03:26:22.980 --> 03:26:24.205
MARISHA: Can I put it in the bowl?

5067
03:26:24.205 --> 03:26:25.180
MATT: I mean, it's not your turn.

5068
03:26:25.180 --> 03:26:26.603
MARISHA: It's not my turn.

5069
03:26:26.603 --> 03:26:28.516
MATT: Caleb, you're up.

5070
03:26:28.516 --> 03:26:30.304
LIAM: Did I see any of that?

5071
03:26:30.304 --> 03:26:33.176
MATT: I don't know, did you see any of that? (laughs)

5072
03:26:33.176 --> 03:26:34.455
LIAM: I was not looking for that at all.

5073
03:26:34.455 --> 03:26:36.281
I was paying attention to the holes.

5074
03:26:36.281 --> 03:26:37.949
I'm going to do what Caleb would do.

5075
03:26:37.949 --> 03:26:41.816
Caleb sort of gets and looks over the edge.

5076
03:26:41.816 --> 03:26:43.652
What exactly does he see?

5077
03:26:43.652 --> 03:26:45.189
Like how far down does it go?

5078
03:26:45.189 --> 03:26:48.153
Yeah, how far down that slope?

5079
03:26:48.153 --> 03:26:50.547
MARISHA: The River Styx.
LIAM: How far down do I see?

5080
03:26:50.547 --> 03:26:51.437
MATT: From how you look down, you can see down

5081
03:26:51.437 --> 03:26:53.660
about ten feet or so where the edge

5082
03:26:53.660 --> 03:26:56.541
of where the bodies begin and beyond that,

5083
03:26:56.541 --> 03:26:57.834
from what little bit of light is here,

5084
03:26:57.834 --> 03:27:00.543
you can see about 20 feet below

5085
03:27:00.543 --> 03:27:03.114
and it's just bodies and bodies and bodies and bodies.

5086
03:27:03.114 --> 03:27:05.469
LIAM: The bodies that are ten feet away are what?

5087
03:27:05.469 --> 03:27:06.755
Corpses coming up?
MATT: Yeah.

5088
03:27:06.755 --> 03:27:08.312
They're climbing. You see the pockmarks

5089
03:27:08.312 --> 03:27:10.199
and the little elements in the outside.

5090
03:27:10.199 --> 03:27:13.355
They're climbing them and coming out of the hole

5091
03:27:13.355 --> 03:27:15.515
and joining you guys up on the platform.

5092
03:27:15.515 --> 03:27:17.038
LIAM: Oh, fire in the hole!

5093
03:27:17.038 --> 03:27:19.515
(claps)
TALIESIN: All right.

5094
03:27:19.515 --> 03:27:20.508
LIAM: That's what he would do.

5095
03:27:20.508 --> 03:27:23.897
So I am throwing a ball of fire

5096
03:27:23.897 --> 03:27:27.047
down about 40 feet.
MATT: Okay.

5097
03:27:27.047 --> 03:27:27.995
LIAM: Yeah.

5098
03:27:27.995 --> 03:27:31.445
MATT: (deep explosion) You guys feel the ground

5099
03:27:31.445 --> 03:27:33.031
shake a bit from the impact. Roll some damage.

5100
03:27:33.031 --> 03:27:34.166
LIAM: Yeah.
LAURA: Oh god.

5101
03:27:34.166 --> 03:27:36.080
We're setting free whatever is buried here

5102
03:27:36.080 --> 03:27:39.357
and supposed to be entombed forever.

5103
03:27:39.357 --> 03:27:40.774
We're fucking that up.

5104
03:27:40.774 --> 03:27:42.199
TRAVIS: Is there a door right here?
SAM: Yeah.

5105
03:27:42.199 --> 03:27:44.950
ASHLEY: Yep.
TRAVIS: Nobody's checking that door?

5106
03:27:44.950 --> 03:27:46.607
LIAM: 29.
MATT: 29.

5107
03:27:46.607 --> 03:27:48.416
LAURA: I though that's what the investigation was at the

5108
03:27:48.416 --> 03:27:50.709
beginning. I thought it was sealed.

5109
03:27:50.709 --> 03:27:53.200
It's a sealed door. Nobody's actually checked it?

5110
03:27:53.200 --> 03:27:55.501
MATT: You didn't see any opening or space or--?

5111
03:27:55.501 --> 03:27:56.873
LIAM: We didn't check it. We didn't check it

5112
03:27:56.873 --> 03:27:59.099
to see if there was a hidden latch, traps?

5113
03:27:59.099 --> 03:28:00.692
MARISHA: Well, we're in the middle of--

5114
03:28:00.692 --> 03:28:02.254
LIAM: No, I know.
MARISHA: --looking at a pedestal.

5115
03:28:02.254 --> 03:28:05.031
LIAM: Now there's corpses coming out of holes.

5116
03:28:05.031 --> 03:28:08.591
TALIESIN: We're fine. We're fine.

5117
03:28:08.591 --> 03:28:09.441
Just as long as someone

5118
03:28:09.441 --> 03:28:12.442
actually does something, we're fine. We're clerics.

5119
03:28:12.442 --> 03:28:15.264
MATT: (booming) Bodies and limbs and chunks

5120
03:28:15.264 --> 03:28:18.600
of dried zombie parts go flying out of the hole

5121
03:28:18.600 --> 03:28:20.428
and scattering across the room,

5122
03:28:20.428 --> 03:28:22.283
hitting the far wall on the opposite side.

5123
03:28:22.283 --> 03:28:23.517
Flung on the inside and you can see

5124
03:28:23.517 --> 03:28:24.780
a whole section of it's exploded

5125
03:28:24.780 --> 03:28:26.658
and then falls in to create this little pit in there.

5126
03:28:26.658 --> 03:28:28.293
TRAVIS: With a dismembered bitch slap as it comes out,

5127
03:28:28.293 --> 03:28:30.493
like (splats).
(laughter)

5128
03:28:30.493 --> 03:28:31.648
MATT: Yeah, Fjord, make a dexterity saving throw.

5129
03:28:31.648 --> 03:28:32.601
TRAVIS: No!
MARISHA: Aw, yeah!

5130
03:28:32.601 --> 03:28:33.897
MATT: Make a dexterity saving throw.

5131
03:28:33.897 --> 03:28:35.348
TRAVIS: Damn it!
(laughter)

5132
03:28:35.348 --> 03:28:37.081
TRAVIS: A four.
MATT: (slapping sound)

5133
03:28:37.081 --> 03:28:39.456
(laughter)

5134
03:28:39.456 --> 03:28:42.013
MATT: It (slurps) off the face.

5135
03:28:42.013 --> 03:28:43.006
TRAVIS: It's hooked on the tusk.

5136
03:28:43.006 --> 03:28:44.736
MATT: The finger moves,

5137
03:28:44.736 --> 03:28:46.433
the fingers try to climb their way--

5138
03:28:46.433 --> 03:28:47.351
TRAVIS: Ah, no!

5139
03:28:47.351 --> 03:28:49.905
MATT: (laughs)
TALIESIN: No,

5140
03:28:49.905 --> 03:28:50.813
you don't know where that's been, come on.

5141
03:28:50.813 --> 03:28:53.818
LAURA: That's creepier than the spiders.

5142
03:28:53.818 --> 03:28:55.782
MATT: Thanks for that, Travis.

5143
03:28:55.782 --> 03:28:57.459
TRAVIS: Shit.
MATT: Yeah, so (whooshes)

5144
03:28:57.459 --> 03:29:00.005
the explosion, the hole steeps in a bit.

5145
03:29:00.005 --> 03:29:01.081
LIAM: Okay.
MATT: Yep.

5146
03:29:01.081 --> 03:29:03.057
LIAM: I will dance back to the center of the room,

5147
03:29:03.057 --> 03:29:05.346
by the pedestal near Fjord.

5148
03:29:05.346 --> 03:29:07.335
MATT: There?
LIAM: Yeah, right there.

5149
03:29:07.335 --> 03:29:08.435
MATT: All right, you got it.

5150
03:29:08.435 --> 03:29:10.858
That finishes your go there.

5151
03:29:10.858 --> 03:29:12.491
Now.
SAM: Oh, boy.

5152
03:29:12.491 --> 03:29:14.844
MATT: This guy's gone.
SAM: Now.

5153
03:29:14.844 --> 03:29:18.494
MATT: Now.
SAM: Get to the choppah.

5154
03:29:18.494 --> 03:29:19.916
MATT: That was cocked.

5155
03:29:19.916 --> 03:29:21.432
SAM: Now!

5156
03:29:23.724 --> 03:29:25.668
Oh, there's another.
LAURA: Oh, no, there's more.

5157
03:29:25.668 --> 03:29:28.676
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah. We've got to solve this.

5158
03:29:28.676 --> 03:29:30.364
LAURA: Bloop, bloop.
ASHLEY: Okay.

5159
03:29:30.364 --> 03:29:33.131
ASHLEY: They're slow. We can keep them at bay.

5160
03:29:33.131 --> 03:29:34.511
We'll just figure out how to--

5161
03:29:34.511 --> 03:29:36.541
LIAM: Where did those two come from?

5162
03:29:36.541 --> 03:29:38.197
MATT: From climbing underneath the pile of those

5163
03:29:38.197 --> 03:29:39.376
that weren't blown away from--

5164
03:29:39.376 --> 03:29:42.060
LAURA: Endless amounts. There's endless amounts, dude.

5165
03:29:42.060 --> 03:29:43.348
LIAM: Are they blackened?

5166
03:29:43.348 --> 03:29:45.166
Are they grilled?

5167
03:29:45.166 --> 03:29:46.599
TALIESIN: I mean, they're leather.

5168
03:29:46.599 --> 03:29:48.182
TRAVIS: Oh, Jesus.

5169
03:29:48.182 --> 03:29:51.007
LAURA: That one's creepy. I don't like that one.

5170
03:29:51.007 --> 03:29:55.574
That one looks like he will-- oh god, they are.

5171
03:29:55.574 --> 03:29:57.192
MATT: They're all just like--

5172
03:29:57.192 --> 03:29:59.150
LAURA: Ew, that one's creepy too.

5173
03:29:59.150 --> 03:30:01.450
MATT: That's going to be two attacks on you, Caleb.

5174
03:30:04.646 --> 03:30:06.379
That's going to be a 12 to hit.

5175
03:30:06.379 --> 03:30:07.429
LIAM: Does not hit.

5176
03:30:07.429 --> 03:30:10.350
MATT: And a 24 to hit.
LIAM: Does hit.

5177
03:30:10.350 --> 03:30:12.447
MATT: Oh, sorry, not 24, 21.
LIAM: Does hit.

5178
03:30:12.447 --> 03:30:13.942
MATT: All righty.

5179
03:30:13.942 --> 03:30:17.001
You take four points of bludgeoning damage

5180
03:30:17.001 --> 03:30:18.676
as it slams you from behind

5181
03:30:18.676 --> 03:30:20.574
and is trying to grab your shoulder.

5182
03:30:21.932 --> 03:30:24.982
We have two attacking Fjord.

5183
03:30:26.796 --> 03:30:28.089
I rolled really well.

5184
03:30:28.089 --> 03:30:30.261
18, 21.
TRAVIS: Both hit.

5185
03:30:30.261 --> 03:30:31.515
MATT: All righty.

5186
03:30:31.515 --> 03:30:34.928
You suffer 12 points of bludgeoning damage

5187
03:30:34.928 --> 03:30:37.103
as both of them-- one grabs your shoulder

5188
03:30:37.103 --> 03:30:38.640
and the other one grabs your head

5189
03:30:38.640 --> 03:30:39.954
and they both slam into you

5190
03:30:39.954 --> 03:30:41.619
and try and bite and grasp at your body.

5191
03:30:41.619 --> 03:30:42.774
They're both holding on

5192
03:30:42.774 --> 03:30:44.718
and you're having to push them off.

5193
03:30:44.718 --> 03:30:47.247
Then we have one attacking you, Yasha, with advantage

5194
03:30:47.247 --> 03:30:49.625
because you did your strikes.

5195
03:30:49.625 --> 03:30:51.530
That, actually, brings it to an 18 to hit.

5196
03:30:51.530 --> 03:30:53.701
ASHLEY: Mm-hmm.
MATT: You suffer

5197
03:30:53.701 --> 03:30:54.754
five points of bludgeoning damage

5198
03:30:54.754 --> 03:30:56.196
reduced to two because you're raging.

5199
03:30:56.196 --> 03:30:57.272
ASHLEY: Okay.

5200
03:30:57.272 --> 03:30:59.541
MATT: Then we have one against Jester.

5201
03:30:59.541 --> 03:31:01.635
That's going to be 16 to hit.

5202
03:31:01.635 --> 03:31:03.200
(booms) because you have the shield.

5203
03:31:03.200 --> 03:31:05.213
One against Nott.

5204
03:31:05.213 --> 03:31:06.638
That's a 12 to hit.
SAM: No!

5205
03:31:06.638 --> 03:31:08.749
MATT: You dodge out of the way.
SAM: Duck.

5206
03:31:08.749 --> 03:31:09.806
MATT: Then we have one over here

5207
03:31:09.806 --> 03:31:12.244
that's going to attack Beau.

5208
03:31:12.244 --> 03:31:13.971
It just climbed its way out.

5209
03:31:13.971 --> 03:31:17.116
That's a six (laughs).

5210
03:31:17.116 --> 03:31:19.947
All right, that finishes their turn.

5211
03:31:19.947 --> 03:31:21.864
That brings us to Nott.

5212
03:31:22.737 --> 03:31:23.983
SAM: Those torture implements,

5213
03:31:23.983 --> 03:31:27.129
were they very shiny and new or were they old and rusty?

5214
03:31:27.129 --> 03:31:28.690
MATT: Very old.

5215
03:31:28.690 --> 03:31:32.401
You didn't see too much rust on them, per se,

5216
03:31:32.401 --> 03:31:35.164
but they're--
SAM: They're old.

5217
03:31:35.164 --> 03:31:37.334
MATT: They're old.
SAM: Okay.

5218
03:31:37.334 --> 03:31:38.917
I will ignore them.

5219
03:31:40.028 --> 03:31:41.567
I guess I could walk through these guys

5220
03:31:41.567 --> 03:31:44.342
and just take attacks of opportunity or,

5221
03:31:44.342 --> 03:31:45.320
how far away is the door?

5222
03:31:45.320 --> 03:31:48.723
I will cast Mage Hand and try to open the door

5223
03:31:48.723 --> 03:31:52.600
from whence I stand.
MATT: All righty, the Hand

5224
03:31:52.600 --> 03:31:55.017
drifts over to the door there.

5225
03:31:56.353 --> 03:32:00.736
Goes for-- and you can see a central handle.

5226
03:32:00.736 --> 03:32:01.923
There isn't a knob or a thing.

5227
03:32:01.923 --> 03:32:04.025
There's just a little handle thing

5228
03:32:04.025 --> 03:32:08.067
and the hand tries to pull, push, nothing.

5229
03:32:08.067 --> 03:32:12.238
SAM: That's my action, right?
LIAM: It's weak, though.

5230
03:32:12.238 --> 03:32:15.239
SAM: Okay, that didn't work, so I'll walk on over there

5231
03:32:15.239 --> 03:32:17.674
and take my attacks-o'-opportunity.

5232
03:32:17.674 --> 03:32:19.453
MATT: All right, so you move over to that space.

5233
03:32:19.453 --> 03:32:21.249
There's two of them swinging at you.

5234
03:32:21.249 --> 03:32:25.808
(groans) All of them make this horrible like (gasps)

5235
03:32:25.808 --> 03:32:28.667
sucking sound as they're trying to make noise and gurgle,

5236
03:32:28.667 --> 03:32:32.703
but there's just very thin, reedy, moistureless

5237
03:32:32.703 --> 03:32:34.946
vocal chords and flesh trying to make this gravel--

5238
03:32:34.946 --> 03:32:36.592
LAURA: These are old bodies.

5239
03:32:36.592 --> 03:32:38.300
Really, really old bodies.

5240
03:32:38.300 --> 03:32:39.983
MATT: A nine and a natural one.

5241
03:32:39.983 --> 03:32:41.854
You're too fast, dodging through them

5242
03:32:41.854 --> 03:32:43.918
as you rush over there.

5243
03:32:43.918 --> 03:32:46.407
SAM: I guess I still have a bonus action or something.

5244
03:32:46.407 --> 03:32:47.897
MATT: I believe so.

5245
03:32:47.897 --> 03:32:50.619
SAM: I can't try to open-- can I try to open the door

5246
03:32:50.619 --> 03:32:54.292
with my physical hand now or can I look for traps

5247
03:32:54.292 --> 03:32:55.476
or what can I do?

5248
03:32:55.476 --> 03:32:56.657
LIAM: Dash, disengage, hide.
MATT: Yeah,

5249
03:32:56.657 --> 03:32:58.644
dash, disengage, and hide, so no, you do not.

5250
03:32:58.644 --> 03:33:02.384
SAM: Can't you do a bonus action use item or anything?

5251
03:33:02.384 --> 03:33:03.703
MATT: It's an action to Use Object.

5252
03:33:03.703 --> 03:33:05.453
SAM: Inspect? No.

5253
03:33:05.453 --> 03:33:06.573
MATT: If you're going to look real hard for something,

5254
03:33:06.573 --> 03:33:07.452
it's an action.

5255
03:33:07.452 --> 03:33:08.642
SAM: Okay.

5256
03:33:08.642 --> 03:33:11.392
Then I will just sit and think about things.

5257
03:33:11.392 --> 03:33:13.464
MATT: All righty, Fjord, you're up.

5258
03:33:13.464 --> 03:33:18.464
TRAVIS: I am going to cast Hex on this zombie.

5259
03:33:18.827 --> 03:33:21.096
MATT: All right.
TRAVIS: Undead person.

5260
03:33:21.096 --> 03:33:22.675
MATT: Right here?
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

5261
03:33:22.675 --> 03:33:25.325
MATT: A regular Hex or your...?
TRAVIS: Regular Hex.

5262
03:33:25.325 --> 03:33:28.222
Actually, you make a good point.

5263
03:33:28.222 --> 03:33:31.376
MATT: It's up to you.
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's, mm.

5264
03:33:31.376 --> 03:33:32.709
Regular Hex.
MATT: Okay.

5265
03:33:32.709 --> 03:33:34.558
TRAVIS: I will use my bonus action

5266
03:33:34.558 --> 03:33:36.936
to use Relentless Hex and teleport

5267
03:33:36.936 --> 03:33:40.022
within five feet of--
MATT: Well, is it in bonus action?

5268
03:33:40.022 --> 03:33:42.801
Is Hex a bonus action to cast?

5269
03:33:42.801 --> 03:33:44.067
TALIESIN: I think it is.
TRAVIS: Is it?

5270
03:33:44.067 --> 03:33:46.680
MATT: Is it? Double check it.

5271
03:33:46.680 --> 03:33:48.623
TALIESIN: Percy thinks so.
TRAVIS: It is a bonus action.

5272
03:33:48.623 --> 03:33:49.456
You're right.

5273
03:33:49.456 --> 03:33:50.873
Balls ass!

5274
03:33:53.681 --> 03:33:56.681
Hexblade's Curse is also a bonus action.

5275
03:33:59.149 --> 03:34:00.616
MATT: You did curse the one over there.

5276
03:34:03.386 --> 03:34:05.356
TRAVIS: Mm-hm.
(laughter)

5277
03:34:05.356 --> 03:34:09.273
MATT: If you want to move it knowing that, you can.

5278
03:34:10.646 --> 03:34:11.871
TRAVIS: (mutters) ...points of damage--

5279
03:34:11.871 --> 03:34:13.012
MATT: Yasha, Jester, you're on deck.

5280
03:34:13.012 --> 03:34:16.193
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's-- fuck.

5281
03:34:16.193 --> 03:34:17.026
A<i>nus</i>.

5282
03:34:18.452 --> 03:34:20.299
SAM: Did you just anus?
LAURA: A<i>nus</i>!

5283
03:34:20.299 --> 03:34:21.132
TRAVIS: Yeah.

5284
03:34:22.105 --> 03:34:23.605
TALIESIN: Cross<i>bow</i>.
LAURA: A<i>nus</i>!

5285
03:34:24.552 --> 03:34:26.960
TRAVIS: Let's not-- I'll move the Hex

5286
03:34:26.960 --> 03:34:29.123
onto this one right here.

5287
03:34:29.123 --> 03:34:30.332
TALIESIN: Ca<i>du</i>ceus.
MARISHA: Ca<i>du</i>ceus.

5288
03:34:30.332 --> 03:34:32.340
TALIESIN: Whoa, that's weird.

5289
03:34:35.304 --> 03:34:38.391
TRAVIS: Yeah, and I'll take a swing with the falchion

5290
03:34:38.391 --> 03:34:40.150
at the Hexed one.
MATT: Go for it.

5291
03:34:40.150 --> 03:34:43.898
Bonus action, (whooshes), first attack.

5292
03:34:43.898 --> 03:34:46.300
TRAVIS: Man, it's been a hot second since I Hexed anybody.

5293
03:34:46.300 --> 03:34:48.560
MATT: Takes an addition d6 necrotic damage when you hit it.

5294
03:34:48.560 --> 03:34:50.331
TRAVIS: Okay, that's right, just a d6.

5295
03:34:50.331 --> 03:34:51.164
MATT: Yep.
TRAVIS: Okay.

5296
03:34:51.164 --> 03:34:53.255
LIAM: Talking about that dang cunnilingus.

5297
03:34:53.255 --> 03:34:55.240
(snickering)

5298
03:34:55.240 --> 03:34:56.851
TRAVIS: 29.
MATT: That hits.

5299
03:34:56.851 --> 03:34:59.254
Go ahead and roll some damage.

5300
03:34:59.254 --> 03:35:01.504
TALIESIN: That's the dumbest thing.

5301
03:35:02.804 --> 03:35:04.863
LIAM: Just a novelty ten minute sketch a round.

5302
03:35:07.482 --> 03:35:10.682
TRAVIS: Nine and four, so that's 13 points of

5303
03:35:10.682 --> 03:35:13.670
slashing damage.

5304
03:35:13.670 --> 03:35:14.963
MATT: A blade carves through a part of it.

5305
03:35:14.963 --> 03:35:16.866
One of its arms falls onto the ground

5306
03:35:16.866 --> 03:35:18.365
and it's still standing. It looks hurt,

5307
03:35:18.365 --> 03:35:20.175
but it's (groans).

5308
03:35:20.175 --> 03:35:22.334
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll try to take another try.

5309
03:35:22.334 --> 03:35:24.182
MATT: Go for it.

5310
03:35:24.182 --> 03:35:26.015
TRAVIS: 18 to hit.
MATT: 18 hits.

5311
03:35:30.306 --> 03:35:34.022
TRAVIS: Seven, six.

5312
03:35:34.022 --> 03:35:35.597
13 points of slashing damage.

5313
03:35:35.597 --> 03:35:37.068
MATT: Slashing damage.

5314
03:35:37.068 --> 03:35:39.512
(wet groaning) You carve into its chest.

5315
03:35:39.512 --> 03:35:42.163
It breaks open, the ribcage is exposed,

5316
03:35:42.163 --> 03:35:44.047
and it falls to the ground

5317
03:35:44.047 --> 03:35:46.035
and (groans) gets back up.

5318
03:35:46.035 --> 03:35:47.958
TRAVIS: Fuck, yeah, okay, cool.

5319
03:35:47.958 --> 03:35:50.085
MATT: 18 on that one.

5320
03:35:50.085 --> 03:35:51.526
All right, that's your turn.
TRAVIS: That's it.

5321
03:35:51.526 --> 03:35:52.884
MATT: Jester, Yasha, what you guys doing?

5322
03:35:54.334 --> 03:35:58.187
LAURA: I'm going to--
SAM: Get us out of the room!

5323
03:35:58.187 --> 03:36:01.512
LAURA: Move closer to everyone.

5324
03:36:01.512 --> 03:36:02.776
SAM: To the door?

5325
03:36:02.776 --> 03:36:06.269
LAURA: I'm the only thing that can take these things out,

5326
03:36:06.269 --> 03:36:07.513
me and Caduceus.

5327
03:36:07.513 --> 03:36:08.477
MATT: Closer to the door, you mean?

5328
03:36:08.477 --> 03:36:09.627
LAURA: No, closer to the group of people.

5329
03:36:09.627 --> 03:36:10.992
Yeah, like right there.

5330
03:36:10.992 --> 03:36:13.323
MATT: There, all right.
LAURA: I'm going to cast

5331
03:36:13.323 --> 03:36:17.156
Spiritual Guardians.
SAM: Spiritual!

5332
03:36:17.156 --> 03:36:18.782
TALIESIN: Oh, well, that's a way to go.

5333
03:36:18.782 --> 03:36:21.453
MATT: That's a radius of?
LAURA: 15 feet around me.

5334
03:36:21.453 --> 03:36:22.859
MATT: Around you at all times, right?

5335
03:36:22.859 --> 03:36:24.622
LAURA: Yes, on anything that isn't us.

5336
03:36:24.622 --> 03:36:25.496
MATT: You got it.

5337
03:36:25.496 --> 03:36:28.950
LAURA: The unicorns are out and they are angry!

5338
03:36:28.950 --> 03:36:30.400
TRAVIS: Yeah!

5339
03:36:30.400 --> 03:36:32.675
MARISHA: I've missed the unicorns!

5340
03:36:34.753 --> 03:36:36.331
TRAVIS: (Jester's accent) Hupperdook!

5341
03:36:36.331 --> 03:36:37.339
MARISHA: Yes!

5342
03:36:37.339 --> 03:36:38.997
ASHLEY: (Jester's accent) Hupperdook!

5343
03:36:38.997 --> 03:36:40.744
MATT: All right, Spiritual Guardians.

5344
03:36:40.744 --> 03:36:41.725
Let me get that ready.

5345
03:36:41.725 --> 03:36:44.253
LAURA: When they move into or start their turn.

5346
03:36:44.253 --> 03:36:45.102
MATT: You got it.

5347
03:36:45.102 --> 03:36:46.362
All right, that finishes your turn.

5348
03:36:46.362 --> 03:36:48.387
TALIESIN: Doesn't when you cast it, it has--

5349
03:36:48.387 --> 03:36:49.632
LAURA: No, we've talked about this before.

5350
03:36:49.632 --> 03:36:51.515
It's only on the beginning of their turn.

5351
03:36:51.515 --> 03:36:52.366
ASHLEY: All right.

5352
03:36:52.366 --> 03:36:53.885
I might not be able to do this,

5353
03:36:53.885 --> 03:36:55.978
but is there one that's close enough

5354
03:36:55.978 --> 03:36:59.224
that looks really ripped up

5355
03:36:59.224 --> 03:37:01.603
and torn up and a mess?

5356
03:37:01.603 --> 03:37:03.592
MATT: There's the one five feet from you

5357
03:37:03.592 --> 03:37:05.915
that is what Fjord's been tearing into.

5358
03:37:05.915 --> 03:37:07.237
ASHLEY: Tell me if this is possible or not.

5359
03:37:07.237 --> 03:37:08.113
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: Do it.

5360
03:37:08.113 --> 03:37:10.721
ASHLEY: If it's not-- I want to just (whooshes).

5361
03:37:10.721 --> 03:37:11.955
MARISHA: Grab its heart.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

5362
03:37:11.955 --> 03:37:13.304
MARISHA: Grab it by the heart.
ASHLEY: I want to do

5363
03:37:13.304 --> 03:37:15.399
the Ace Ventura.
MARISHA: Yeah.

5364
03:37:15.399 --> 03:37:16.458
MATT: Sure, yeah, you want to do that?

5365
03:37:16.458 --> 03:37:17.291
ASHLEY: Yeah.

5366
03:37:17.291 --> 03:37:18.124
MATT: All right, roll an attack.

5367
03:37:18.124 --> 03:37:19.248
You have to move up to it.
TALIESIN: In high school, we called that

5368
03:37:19.248 --> 03:37:20.736
the grab, the rip, and the display.

5369
03:37:20.736 --> 03:37:22.015
MATT: That guy gets an attack of opportunity against you.

5370
03:37:22.015 --> 03:37:23.920
ASHLEY: Okay.
LAURA: Yeah.

5371
03:37:23.920 --> 03:37:25.008
Indiana Jones.
ASHLEY: And advantage

5372
03:37:25.008 --> 03:37:27.087
because reckless.
MATT: Correct.

5373
03:37:27.087 --> 03:37:28.533
You're doing reckless again this turn?

5374
03:37:28.533 --> 03:37:29.366
Okay.

5375
03:37:30.820 --> 03:37:34.269
That would be a 14. Does that hit?

5376
03:37:34.269 --> 03:37:35.538
ASHLEY: No.

5377
03:37:35.538 --> 03:37:37.535
MATT: It rakes its fingers across your back,

5378
03:37:37.535 --> 03:37:39.726
but your little bit of cloak

5379
03:37:39.726 --> 03:37:41.078
just gets tugged a bit before its fingers

5380
03:37:41.078 --> 03:37:42.933
just tear out of the cloth, no effect.

5381
03:37:42.933 --> 03:37:44.596
You reach over towards it.

5382
03:37:44.596 --> 03:37:45.884
Magician's Judge goes up from one side

5383
03:37:45.884 --> 03:37:46.880
and you reach your hand forward.

5384
03:37:46.880 --> 03:37:48.646
Roll for attack with advantage.

5385
03:37:49.496 --> 03:37:50.329
ASHLEY: Okay.

5386
03:37:51.232 --> 03:37:52.619
TRAVIS: With advantage, with advantage.

5387
03:37:52.619 --> 03:37:55.702
ASHLEY: Right, right, I'm just making sure.

5388
03:37:56.670 --> 03:37:58.420
Oh, yeah, okay, okay.

5389
03:38:03.158 --> 03:38:05.127
22.
MATT: That definitely hits.

5390
03:38:05.127 --> 03:38:06.773
ASHLEY: Okay.
MATT: All right,

5391
03:38:06.773 --> 03:38:10.091
you do one damage plus your strength modifier.

5392
03:38:10.091 --> 03:38:12.006
ASHLEY: One damage plus my strength--

5393
03:38:12.006 --> 03:38:12.989
MATT: Plus whatever your rage bonus

5394
03:38:12.989 --> 03:38:14.581
and strength modifier, I'll say.

5395
03:38:14.581 --> 03:38:16.257
ASHLEY: Why am I blanking right now?

5396
03:38:16.257 --> 03:38:17.788
TRAVIS: Just plus one to whatever your strength modifier is.

5397
03:38:17.788 --> 03:38:18.713
MATT: Your strength modifier's three.

5398
03:38:18.713 --> 03:38:21.652
ASHLEY: Oh, yes.
MATT: Your rage bonus is?

5399
03:38:21.652 --> 03:38:24.098
ASHLEY: Sorry, I know what you're saying.

5400
03:38:24.098 --> 03:38:25.973
MATT: We'll say whatever your divine damage is,

5401
03:38:25.973 --> 03:38:28.292
this turn, too. Add your d6 divine.

5402
03:38:28.292 --> 03:38:29.516
Because you can do that.

5403
03:38:29.516 --> 03:38:30.580
TALIESIN: Really?

5404
03:38:30.580 --> 03:38:33.029
MATT: Yep.
ASHLEY: Rage bonus is plus three.

5405
03:38:33.029 --> 03:38:34.361
LAURA: So six plus--

5406
03:38:34.361 --> 03:38:35.446
Roll a six.

5407
03:38:35.446 --> 03:38:36.834
MATT: Six and then add a d6 to it.

5408
03:38:36.834 --> 03:38:38.218
ASHLEY: Oh my god, sorry.
MATT: It's okay.

5409
03:38:38.218 --> 03:38:40.518
ASHLEY: Ugh, one, so seven.

5410
03:38:40.518 --> 03:38:42.912
MATT: Seven, eight points.

5411
03:38:42.912 --> 03:38:47.117
(laughs) It rolled literally a seven, so,

5412
03:38:47.117 --> 03:38:48.952
and I added everything up, so you reach out,

5413
03:38:48.952 --> 03:38:51.439
your hand goes through, and as your hand reaches forward,

5414
03:38:51.439 --> 03:38:53.160
you watch electrical energy

5415
03:38:53.160 --> 03:38:54.828
build up at the end of the fingers.

5416
03:38:54.828 --> 03:38:57.779
(booms) As it goes out the other side.

5417
03:38:57.779 --> 03:39:00.438
You see the back of the shoulder blades explode

5418
03:39:00.438 --> 03:39:02.041
and the hand you pull back (crunches),

5419
03:39:02.041 --> 03:39:04.001
tearing through the bones, ribs spill out

5420
03:39:04.001 --> 03:39:06.710
from the exit hole and you can still see energy

5421
03:39:06.710 --> 03:39:09.746
(crackling) off of your fingers.

5422
03:39:09.746 --> 03:39:12.746
The minor blessing of the Stormlord,

5423
03:39:13.625 --> 03:39:17.179
looking in your hand, you have a gray, withered heart.

5424
03:39:17.179 --> 03:39:20.822
Not glowing like the one that Beauregard has found.

5425
03:39:20.822 --> 03:39:22.046
MARISHA: It's not glowing.

5426
03:39:22.046 --> 03:39:23.407
ASHLEY: Okay.

5427
03:39:23.407 --> 03:39:26.238
LAURA: Only some of them are golden heart.

5428
03:39:26.238 --> 03:39:28.095
TRAVIS: I think radiant damage does it.

5429
03:39:28.095 --> 03:39:30.806
LAURA: I don't know, because not all the things I turned

5430
03:39:30.806 --> 03:39:32.151
dropped a heart. Only two of them

5431
03:39:32.151 --> 03:39:34.003
have dropped a heart so far.

5432
03:39:34.003 --> 03:39:35.338
MATT: So that's one action.
ASHLEY: Yeah, okay, so--

5433
03:39:35.338 --> 03:39:37.868
TRAVIS: Did not all that got turned drop gold?

5434
03:39:37.868 --> 03:39:39.679
MARISHA: Goddamn Easter egg hunt.

5435
03:39:39.679 --> 03:39:41.568
MATT: The Hex is gone. You going to move the Hex?

5436
03:39:41.568 --> 03:39:44.950
TRAVIS: Yes, I'll move it back to this one behind Caduceus.

5437
03:39:44.950 --> 03:39:46.867
MATT: Right there.
TRAVIS: Thanks.

5438
03:39:47.930 --> 03:39:49.614
TALIESIN: Moving it might also be a bonus action.

5439
03:39:49.614 --> 03:39:50.714
LIAM: --baseball card.

5440
03:39:50.714 --> 03:39:52.022
MARISHA: I didn't, not today.

5441
03:39:52.022 --> 03:39:55.189
MATT: Double check. It might be, actually.

5442
03:39:58.103 --> 03:39:59.605
LAURA: To move it is a bonus action. It is.

5443
03:39:59.605 --> 03:40:01.455
MATT: I think it might be.
TALIESIN: It is, yep.

5444
03:40:01.455 --> 03:40:03.288
MATT: Yasha.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

5445
03:40:04.330 --> 03:40:07.285
Okay, and I'll try to move a little bit

5446
03:40:07.285 --> 03:40:10.303
towards the pedestal, even though

5447
03:40:10.303 --> 03:40:11.241
this is probably not going to--

5448
03:40:11.241 --> 03:40:12.074
MATT: So right there?
ASHLEY: Yeah.

5449
03:40:12.074 --> 03:40:12.912
MATT: All right, the other guy gets an

5450
03:40:12.912 --> 03:40:16.453
attack of opportunity on you, with advantage.

5451
03:40:16.453 --> 03:40:19.349
Ooh, that's a 22 to hit.
ASHLEY: Yeah, that hits.

5452
03:40:19.349 --> 03:40:20.827
MATT: All right, it slams you in the back

5453
03:40:20.827 --> 03:40:22.527
for five points of bludgeoning damage,

5454
03:40:22.527 --> 03:40:24.539
which you reduce to two.

5455
03:40:24.539 --> 03:40:25.694
ASHLEY: Okay.

5456
03:40:25.694 --> 03:40:26.889
TALIESIN: Ow.

5457
03:40:26.889 --> 03:40:27.772
LAURA: That's like Arnold Schwarzenegger

5458
03:40:27.772 --> 03:40:29.069
getting drop kicked.

5459
03:40:29.069 --> 03:40:31.616
MATT: You still have your second attack if you want to.

5460
03:40:31.616 --> 03:40:33.080
ASHLEY: Oh, yeah, I'm going to turn around and hit the guy,

5461
03:40:33.080 --> 03:40:35.188
then, that just hit me.
MATT: Okay.

5462
03:40:35.188 --> 03:40:39.472
Go ahead and roll attack with advantage.

5463
03:40:39.472 --> 03:40:40.305
ASHLEY: Ooh!

5464
03:40:41.703 --> 03:40:42.536
Okay.

5465
03:40:44.815 --> 03:40:47.148
This is with my sword.
MATT: Yep.

5466
03:40:50.448 --> 03:40:52.637
ASHLEY: 25.
MATT: That definitely hits.

5467
03:40:52.637 --> 03:40:55.470
They have an AC of eight.

5468
03:40:57.268 --> 03:41:00.983
ASHLEY: Okay, six, 11 points of damage.

5469
03:41:00.983 --> 03:41:02.816
MATT: 11 points of damage.

5470
03:41:04.156 --> 03:41:05.648
You take, now, your other hand

5471
03:41:05.648 --> 03:41:06.637
immediately dropped the gray heart

5472
03:41:06.637 --> 03:41:07.673
or are you still holding it?
ASHLEY: Yeah.

5473
03:41:07.673 --> 03:41:08.531
MATT: You drop it behind you.

5474
03:41:08.531 --> 03:41:10.422
The guy hits you from behind and you swing back around.

5475
03:41:10.422 --> 03:41:11.848
Wham, the blade cuts him in half

5476
03:41:11.848 --> 03:41:14.670
and the body crumbles into the ground unmoving.

5477
03:41:14.670 --> 03:41:17.157
SAM: Nice.
TRAVIS: Nice!

5478
03:41:17.157 --> 03:41:19.532
ASHLEY: No glowy?
TRAVIS: And he didn't get back up.

5479
03:41:19.532 --> 03:41:20.924
MATT: So 18 points?

5480
03:41:20.924 --> 03:41:22.937
Sorry, it was?
ASHLEY: 11 points.

5481
03:41:22.937 --> 03:41:23.818
MATT: 11 points, sorry.

5482
03:41:23.818 --> 03:41:25.168
So actually, he's still up.

5483
03:41:25.168 --> 03:41:28.766
But he's carved into and standing (groans).

5484
03:41:28.766 --> 03:41:30.770
LAURA: His heart is missing in the-- okay.

5485
03:41:30.770 --> 03:41:32.276
MATT: You don't necessarily see.
LAURA: We don't know that.

5486
03:41:32.276 --> 03:41:33.296
ASHLEY: Okay.
MATT: All right.

5487
03:41:33.296 --> 03:41:34.560
That finishes your turn.

5488
03:41:34.560 --> 03:41:36.260
Jester finished her turn. Beau, you're up.

5489
03:41:36.260 --> 03:41:38.418
MARISHA: Yasha punched the heart out of

5490
03:41:38.418 --> 03:41:40.259
this one or this one?

5491
03:41:40.259 --> 03:41:42.468
MATT: This one here.
MARISHA: This one?

5492
03:41:43.305 --> 03:41:46.848
MATT: You're still holding the glowing heart in your hand.

5493
03:41:46.848 --> 03:41:49.497
MARISHA: Taking a cue from Yasha, I'm going to take my right

5494
03:41:49.497 --> 03:41:53.731
hand and one-inch punch right through its--

5495
03:41:55.685 --> 03:41:57.646
MARISHA: Natural 19.

5496
03:41:57.646 --> 03:41:59.492
MATT: Yeah, go ahead and roll damage on that.

5497
03:42:01.767 --> 03:42:06.111
MARISHA: And then that is 11 damage.

5498
03:42:06.111 --> 03:42:06.960
MATT: 11 damage.

5499
03:42:06.960 --> 03:42:09.022
The fist gets a few inches in.

5500
03:42:09.022 --> 03:42:10.562
You can feel it hitting, breaking through the ribs,

5501
03:42:10.562 --> 03:42:11.933
but it didn't go all the way through.

5502
03:42:11.933 --> 03:42:13.483
You can take the next attack.

5503
03:42:13.483 --> 03:42:15.239
MARISHA: Yeah, 25.
MATT: That hits.

5504
03:42:15.239 --> 03:42:17.594
Roll damage a second time.

5505
03:42:17.594 --> 03:42:19.779
MARISHA: Seven damage.
MATT: Seven damage!

5506
03:42:19.779 --> 03:42:22.779
(whooshes) Your fist goes in and you grab onto the heart,

5507
03:42:22.779 --> 03:42:25.029
but it's still taut in there.

5508
03:42:25.029 --> 03:42:26.665
It's not dead.

5509
03:42:26.665 --> 03:42:28.789
MARISHA: It's not a dead heart or not dead?

5510
03:42:28.789 --> 03:42:29.753
MATT: Well, I mean, it's still alive.

5511
03:42:29.753 --> 03:42:31.246
You haven't been able to pull it out,

5512
03:42:31.246 --> 03:42:33.338
so you have to roll a bonus action.

5513
03:42:33.338 --> 03:42:36.421
MARISHA: Bonus action to yank it out.

5514
03:42:37.521 --> 03:42:39.438
17.
MATT: 17, roll damage.

5515
03:42:40.838 --> 03:42:43.012
MARISHA: (groans) Seven.

5516
03:42:43.012 --> 03:42:44.153
MATT: Seven.

5517
03:42:45.634 --> 03:42:48.190
Okay, so you grab it and you pull back

5518
03:42:48.190 --> 03:42:51.792
and the zombie (clicks) grabs your arm and is like (growls)

5519
03:42:51.792 --> 03:42:52.914
and you can't pull your hand out of its body.

5520
03:42:52.914 --> 03:42:53.764
MARISHA: Don't bite!

5521
03:42:53.764 --> 03:42:58.049
MATT: It's on death's door, but it seems it's resisting

5522
03:42:58.049 --> 03:42:59.874
the crumbling of its necromantic form.

5523
03:42:59.874 --> 03:43:03.494
MARISHA: Do I get the same feeling in this hand?

5524
03:43:03.494 --> 03:43:06.118
MATT: That warmth, nope.
(groans)

5525
03:43:06.118 --> 03:43:07.263
MARISHA: Well, I'm like, oh--
TRAVIS: (cheerful) Put the new heart

5526
03:43:07.263 --> 03:43:10.433
in the old zombie!
SAM: (laughs)

5527
03:43:10.433 --> 03:43:13.127
MARISHA: I'm trying to help you!

5528
03:43:13.127 --> 03:43:15.149
MATT: You got that, all right.

5529
03:43:15.149 --> 03:43:16.335
Is that the end of your turn?

5530
03:43:16.335 --> 03:43:17.390
MARISHA: Can I move away?

5531
03:43:17.390 --> 03:43:18.614
Can I let go and move?

5532
03:43:18.614 --> 03:43:20.104
MATT: Sure, yeah, you can.
MARISHA: At this point.

5533
03:43:20.104 --> 03:43:21.634
Yeah.
MATT: Where you going to move to?

5534
03:43:21.634 --> 03:43:23.391
MARISHA: Towards the pedestal.
MATT: Okay.

5535
03:43:23.391 --> 03:43:26.808
You can get over--
MARISHA: That's fine.

5536
03:43:26.808 --> 03:43:29.611
MATT: Okay, it gets an attack of opportunity against you.

5537
03:43:29.611 --> 03:43:31.184
MARISHA: Cha.
MATT: As you move past.

5538
03:43:31.184 --> 03:43:32.017
MARISHA: Yeah.

5539
03:43:33.213 --> 03:43:34.941
TALIESIN: A couple of them have already taken--

5540
03:43:34.941 --> 03:43:36.582
MATT: Misses, no worries.
MARISHA: Okay.

5541
03:43:36.582 --> 03:43:38.999
MATT: Okay, end of your turn?
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

5542
03:43:38.999 --> 03:43:41.772
MATT: Okay, the heart in your hand goes dull and gray.

5543
03:43:41.772 --> 03:43:42.605
MARISHA: No!

5544
03:43:44.832 --> 03:43:46.152
Fucking what?

5545
03:43:46.152 --> 03:43:47.335
LAURA: What does it mean?!

5546
03:43:47.335 --> 03:43:48.374
TALIESIN: We needed to get it in there fast

5547
03:43:48.374 --> 03:43:49.223
is what we--
LAURA: Oh, we've got to

5548
03:43:49.223 --> 03:43:50.072
get it in the thing.

5549
03:43:50.072 --> 03:43:52.636
We've got to put it in the--

5550
03:43:52.636 --> 03:43:54.106
SAM: In the what?
LAURA: In the pedestal.

5551
03:43:54.106 --> 03:43:55.055
MARISHA: We've got to put it in the bowl.

5552
03:43:55.055 --> 03:43:55.924
TALIESIN: None of this is making me happy,

5553
03:43:55.924 --> 03:43:58.390
but we have the 15 feet of clearance right now, so.

5554
03:43:58.390 --> 03:43:59.223
MARISHA: That's what I was going to go for.

5555
03:43:59.223 --> 03:44:01.029
SAM: So we need three on?
LIAM: Maybe.

5556
03:44:01.029 --> 03:44:03.023
Checking the door, maybe.
TALIESIN: I'm going to

5557
03:44:03.023 --> 03:44:05.493
hit the one that's right next to Caleb

5558
03:44:05.493 --> 03:44:07.556
with a standard Sacred Flame

5559
03:44:07.556 --> 03:44:10.230
since that's what we're at.
MATT: Okay, go for it.

5560
03:44:10.230 --> 03:44:11.438
TALIESIN: Actually, that one's within the

5561
03:44:11.438 --> 03:44:12.707
15 foot radius right now.

5562
03:44:12.707 --> 03:44:13.561
MATT: It is.

5563
03:44:13.561 --> 03:44:14.394
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm going to shoot outside the

5564
03:44:14.394 --> 03:44:16.285
15 foot radius then. Whichever one's--

5565
03:44:16.285 --> 03:44:17.585
MATT: There's these two over here

5566
03:44:17.585 --> 03:44:19.705
that are standalone.
TALIESIN: Oh, I'll annoy

5567
03:44:19.705 --> 03:44:21.552
one of the standalone ones right over there.

5568
03:44:21.552 --> 03:44:23.206
MATT: Okay, so you turn around and release on that guy

5569
03:44:23.206 --> 03:44:27.413
there. No, it's a failure, so roll damage on that.

5570
03:44:27.413 --> 03:44:31.646
TALIESIN: That's 17 radiant damage.

5571
03:44:31.646 --> 03:44:34.121
MATT: 17 radiant damage. Nice.

5572
03:44:34.121 --> 03:44:36.630
(crackling) Burns into him. He's badly hurt,

5573
03:44:36.630 --> 03:44:39.325
his body is torn apart, but he's still standing.

5574
03:44:39.325 --> 03:44:41.742
So that's your action.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

5575
03:44:43.061 --> 03:44:44.783
Yeah, I'm good.
MATT: Okay, Caleb, you're up.

5576
03:44:44.783 --> 03:44:48.602
LIAM: Okay, I have a bloom of catmint in my hand

5577
03:44:48.602 --> 03:44:50.983
and I thrust it into the air and

5578
03:44:50.983 --> 03:44:54.138
a visage of Frumpkin floats over those two by me

5579
03:44:54.138 --> 03:44:55.237
and then it (whooshes) balloons up

5580
03:44:55.237 --> 03:44:58.778
into a giant orangish rusty cat claw

5581
03:44:58.778 --> 03:45:00.261
and it's going to smash down

5582
03:45:00.261 --> 03:45:03.648
on top of the one that Caduceus just started on.

5583
03:45:03.648 --> 03:45:05.867
MATT: Right here?
SAM: ♪ Frumpkin's Paw! ♪

5584
03:45:05.867 --> 03:45:06.924
LIAM: Is that the one that Caduceus--?

5585
03:45:06.924 --> 03:45:08.311
MATT: Yes.
LIAM: Then we'll do that.

5586
03:45:08.311 --> 03:45:10.546
ASHLEY: That is so cute.

5587
03:45:10.546 --> 03:45:12.610
LIAM: Actually, no, I will do, because I'm in

5588
03:45:12.610 --> 03:45:15.057
the thick of it, so, no. We'll do it by the one that's near

5589
03:45:15.057 --> 03:45:18.092
Yasha and Caleb equally.
MATT: So right there.

5590
03:45:18.092 --> 03:45:19.206
LIAM: Yeah, sure.
MATT: You got it.

5591
03:45:19.206 --> 03:45:21.585
All right, so--
LIAM: And (whooshes).

5592
03:45:21.585 --> 03:45:24.263
MATT: Onto one of them.
LIAM: Yes, the one closest to you.

5593
03:45:24.263 --> 03:45:26.618
MATT: You got it. Go ahead and roll attack on that.

5594
03:45:26.618 --> 03:45:28.524
LIAM: Oh, that's a 19 I rolled.
MATT: That hits.

5595
03:45:28.524 --> 03:45:29.613
Go ahead and roll damage.

5596
03:45:29.613 --> 03:45:32.252
LIAM: Okay, that's 4d8. Where I put them?

5597
03:45:32.252 --> 03:45:37.110
Where did it go? 11, 19, 21 points of damage.

5598
03:45:37.110 --> 03:45:38.402
MATT: 21 points of damage.

5599
03:45:38.402 --> 03:45:39.706
(whooshes) Slams into it.

5600
03:45:39.706 --> 03:45:41.340
It gets crushed in the ground.

5601
03:45:41.340 --> 03:45:44.441
As the paw withdraws, it (gasps) gets up.

5602
03:45:44.441 --> 03:45:47.877
Its head is torn, one arm comes off of the bone

5603
03:45:47.877 --> 03:45:49.890
left behind. It's barely standing.

5604
03:45:49.890 --> 03:45:51.307
LIAM: Son of a bitch!

5605
03:45:54.061 --> 03:45:56.663
Yeah, I will stay my ground because they will

5606
03:45:56.663 --> 03:45:59.665
rake my back if I try to move.
TALIESIN: Well, they're about to--

5607
03:45:59.665 --> 03:46:01.227
MATT: All right, now it's their turn.

5608
03:46:01.227 --> 03:46:03.151
So 15-foot radius.

5609
03:46:03.151 --> 03:46:06.077
One, two, almost all of them but these two

5610
03:46:06.077 --> 03:46:10.686
are affected by it, so, go ahead and roll your damage.

5611
03:46:10.686 --> 03:46:13.118
MARISHA: Fuck yeah, unicorns!
LAURA: Okay, 14.

5612
03:46:13.118 --> 03:46:13.951
SAM: Not bad.

5613
03:46:13.951 --> 03:46:15.955
MATT: 14 damage, all right.
LAURA: Oh, wait, 14.

5614
03:46:15.955 --> 03:46:18.242
Let's see if I add anything because I can't remember.

5615
03:46:18.242 --> 03:46:19.142
MATT: I think it's just the--

5616
03:46:19.142 --> 03:46:22.529
LAURA: It's just that 3d8, yeah.

5617
03:46:22.529 --> 03:46:23.779
It's radiant.

5618
03:46:25.115 --> 03:46:28.020
MATT: Nope, he (whooshes) disintegrates.

5619
03:46:28.020 --> 03:46:29.373
You watch a glowing orb hit the ground.

5620
03:46:29.373 --> 03:46:30.502
LAURA: Ooh!

5621
03:46:30.502 --> 03:46:32.230
TALIESIN: We got one.
MATT: A little heart.

5622
03:46:32.230 --> 03:46:35.329
I'm going to start marking these for where they are.

5623
03:46:35.329 --> 03:46:38.095
We have one there.
LAURA: Okay.

5624
03:46:39.543 --> 03:46:42.757
MATT: That guy over there fails his save.

5625
03:46:42.757 --> 03:46:45.263
He takes 17 points of radiant damage (crackles),

5626
03:46:45.263 --> 03:46:46.225
but he hasn't been damaged before,

5627
03:46:46.225 --> 03:46:49.384
so he looks hurt, but he's still standing.

5628
03:46:49.384 --> 03:46:52.159
This guy there fails.

5629
03:46:52.159 --> 03:46:53.979
He takes 17 points radiant damage.

5630
03:46:53.979 --> 03:46:55.423
LAURA: Oh, it's only 14 points.

5631
03:46:55.423 --> 03:46:57.050
MATT: Oh, 14, sorry.
LAURA: Sorry.

5632
03:46:57.050 --> 03:46:59.080
MATT: 14, 14.

5633
03:46:59.080 --> 03:47:02.479
To the one that was damaged by the cat claw.

5634
03:47:02.479 --> 03:47:06.149
Fails and fails.

5635
03:47:06.149 --> 03:47:09.060
That one is (whooshes) completely incinerated

5636
03:47:09.060 --> 03:47:12.038
by all the radiant unicorns jamming into its body,

5637
03:47:12.038 --> 03:47:13.848
leaving all these holes, it goes (groans),

5638
03:47:13.848 --> 03:47:16.236
falls off to the side.

5639
03:47:16.236 --> 03:47:18.153
No glowing left behind.

5640
03:47:20.154 --> 03:47:22.354
LAURA: They also use their unicorn teeth.

5641
03:47:22.354 --> 03:47:24.338
Just letting you know.
MATT: That one does make its save,

5642
03:47:24.338 --> 03:47:25.838
so it takes half damage.

5643
03:47:25.838 --> 03:47:27.588
MARISHA: Oh, little nibbles.

5644
03:47:28.601 --> 03:47:30.167
MATT: That would be seven points.

5645
03:47:30.167 --> 03:47:33.891
All righty, so now they take their turn.

5646
03:47:33.891 --> 03:47:35.891
This one's going to move forward.

5647
03:47:35.891 --> 03:47:37.236
SAM: Oh, no.
MATT: To Beau.

5648
03:47:37.236 --> 03:47:39.250
This one's going to move. It's going to stay against Fjord.

5649
03:47:39.250 --> 03:47:41.430
This one's going to go ahead and--

5650
03:47:41.430 --> 03:47:42.263
I think it's going to move in.

5651
03:47:42.263 --> 03:47:44.300
They're both going to flank Fjord.

5652
03:47:44.300 --> 03:47:47.235
This one's going to move up to Yasha and then.

5653
03:47:47.235 --> 03:47:48.671
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah.
LAURA: Okay.

5654
03:47:48.671 --> 03:47:50.232
Like this seems silly to use right now.

5655
03:47:50.232 --> 03:47:51.065
LAURA: Yeah.

5656
03:47:57.360 --> 03:47:59.559
SAM: Good gravy, Matthew.

5657
03:47:59.559 --> 03:48:00.855
TALIESIN: Well.

5658
03:48:00.855 --> 03:48:02.160
LAURA: Okay, and then if any of them--

5659
03:48:02.160 --> 03:48:04.359
TALIESIN: Well, I mean, my turn is already...

5660
03:48:04.359 --> 03:48:05.220
LAURA: Is done?

5661
03:48:05.220 --> 03:48:06.228
TALIESIN: I mean, like-- well, yeah.

5662
03:48:06.228 --> 03:48:08.073
SAM: I know you ordered these in bulk,

5663
03:48:08.073 --> 03:48:11.957
but you didn't have to use them all in the same night.

5664
03:48:11.957 --> 03:48:13.949
LAURA: Are any of them coming within the 15?

5665
03:48:13.949 --> 03:48:16.027
MATT: Yes, they are, so those three have to make it now.

5666
03:48:16.027 --> 03:48:17.251
LAURA: Would I roll again or is it just the--

5667
03:48:17.251 --> 03:48:19.291
MATT: I'll let you roll again if you want to.

5668
03:48:21.208 --> 03:48:23.737
LAURA: Oh, that's worse, way worse. I should have kept it.

5669
03:48:23.737 --> 03:48:26.116
Way worse, seven.

5670
03:48:26.116 --> 03:48:27.409
MATT: Seven points to him.

5671
03:48:27.409 --> 03:48:29.107
SAM: Why would you be greedy?

5672
03:48:29.107 --> 03:48:30.508
Because you're greedy.

5673
03:48:30.508 --> 03:48:32.145
LAURA: I didn't know if I needed to.

5674
03:48:32.145 --> 03:48:34.633
I wasn't trying to be greedy.

5675
03:48:34.633 --> 03:48:36.772
Yes, I was.
MARISHA: (laughs)

5676
03:48:37.747 --> 03:48:39.284
MATT: Seven points to him.

5677
03:48:39.284 --> 03:48:41.451
TALIESIN: Is that radiant?

5678
03:48:43.625 --> 03:48:46.191
MATT: So that would be

5679
03:48:47.426 --> 03:48:50.771
one attacking Caduceus with advantage.

5680
03:48:50.771 --> 03:48:52.792
That's going to put it at 17 to hit?

5681
03:48:52.792 --> 03:48:54.679
TALIESIN: Nope.
MATT: (whooshes) Misses.

5682
03:48:54.679 --> 03:48:56.594
Another one attacking without advantage.

5683
03:48:56.594 --> 03:48:57.916
13, misses.
TALIESIN: Nope.

5684
03:48:57.916 --> 03:49:00.205
MATT: One attacking you, Jester.

5685
03:49:00.205 --> 03:49:01.538
Six, misses.

5686
03:49:01.538 --> 03:49:03.705
Attacking you, Beauregard.

5687
03:49:04.635 --> 03:49:06.344
Five, misses.

5688
03:49:06.344 --> 03:49:08.442
Another attacking Caleb.

5689
03:49:08.442 --> 03:49:10.426
It's a 22 to hit.

5690
03:49:10.426 --> 03:49:12.432
I rolled a natural 19.

5691
03:49:12.432 --> 03:49:15.323
You take seven points of bludgeoning damage.

5692
03:49:15.323 --> 03:49:17.639
One attacking Yasha with advantage.

5693
03:49:17.639 --> 03:49:18.556
Natural 20.

5694
03:49:20.213 --> 03:49:23.542
That's 11 points of bludgeoning damage reduced to five.

5695
03:49:23.542 --> 03:49:25.539
MARISHA: I'm never playing a wizard.

5696
03:49:25.539 --> 03:49:26.735
Never.

5697
03:49:27.780 --> 03:49:28.613
LAURA: Never.

5698
03:49:28.613 --> 03:49:30.937
LIAM: Next five campaigns for me, all bloodhunter.

5699
03:49:30.937 --> 03:49:31.770
MATT: Fjord.

5700
03:49:33.196 --> 03:49:35.013
TALIESIN: Is that moving into the 15 foot range also?

5701
03:49:35.013 --> 03:49:38.684
MATT: It does and it takes another seven points of damage.

5702
03:49:38.684 --> 03:49:41.317
That one's going to go ahead and attack Fjord.

5703
03:49:41.317 --> 03:49:44.352
Eight misses and the other one, a natural one, misses.

5704
03:49:44.352 --> 03:49:46.817
Their turn is done, Nott, you're up.

5705
03:49:46.817 --> 03:49:48.900
SAM: Wow, wow, bonus action,

5706
03:49:50.053 --> 03:49:52.118
move the Mage Hand, pick up the heart on the floor.

5707
03:49:52.118 --> 03:49:54.474
LAURA: Yes.
MARISHA: Yes, queen.

5708
03:49:54.474 --> 03:49:56.895
SAM: Put it into the hole.

5709
03:49:56.895 --> 03:49:58.499
MATT: How much space-- how far can you move?

5710
03:49:58.499 --> 03:50:01.612
SAM: 30 feet. I'll move as far as I need to.

5711
03:50:01.612 --> 03:50:04.067
MATT: 15. We'll say it manages to pick it up there.

5712
03:50:04.067 --> 03:50:08.434
That's 15. 20, 25, 30.

5713
03:50:08.434 --> 03:50:09.722
LAURA: Yeah!
MATT: It drops the heart

5714
03:50:09.722 --> 03:50:11.363
into one of the bowls.
SAM: Sure.

5715
03:50:11.363 --> 03:50:12.695
LAURA: Yes!
SAM: Sure.

5716
03:50:12.695 --> 03:50:14.700
LIAM: Hand spin like "Inception."

5717
03:50:14.700 --> 03:50:16.318
TRAVIS: We're still in the dream.

5718
03:50:16.318 --> 03:50:17.889
ASHLEY: And nothing happens.
MATT: It drops into the bowl.

5719
03:50:17.889 --> 03:50:18.925
(splashes) You watch

5720
03:50:18.925 --> 03:50:21.629
the little groove (whooshes) light up.

5721
03:50:21.629 --> 03:50:22.783
LAURA: (gasps)

5722
03:50:22.783 --> 03:50:24.487
SAM: So that's one of three that we need.

5723
03:50:24.487 --> 03:50:25.803
LAURA: Yeah.

5724
03:50:25.803 --> 03:50:27.428
Hopefully we're doing this right.

5725
03:50:27.428 --> 03:50:28.465
SAM: Did the door move it or anything? No.

5726
03:50:28.465 --> 03:50:29.486
MATT: You didn't notice anything.

5727
03:50:29.486 --> 03:50:30.983
SAM: Okay.

5728
03:50:30.983 --> 03:50:32.421
Well, then, in that case, we need to get some more hearts.

5729
03:50:32.421 --> 03:50:33.763
MATT: That was your bonus action to do that, right?

5730
03:50:33.763 --> 03:50:34.818
SAM: That was my bonus action.

5731
03:50:34.818 --> 03:50:36.842
Action, if we need more hearts.

5732
03:50:36.842 --> 03:50:37.934
LAURA: Yes, we need more hearts!

5733
03:50:37.934 --> 03:50:40.417
SAM: I'm going to aim at,

5734
03:50:41.622 --> 03:50:45.705
at one (wheezes), at one of the zombie things.

5735
03:50:45.705 --> 03:50:47.791
LAURA: One of the ones that been hurt.

5736
03:50:47.791 --> 03:50:48.795
SAM: Yeah.
MATT: They've all been hurt

5737
03:50:48.795 --> 03:50:50.444
at this point.
SAM: Has the one next Jester

5738
03:50:50.444 --> 03:50:52.598
been hurt?
LAURA: They've all been hurt.

5739
03:50:52.598 --> 03:50:53.980
MATT: They're all being assaulted

5740
03:50:53.980 --> 03:50:56.023
by a bunch of radiant unicorns.

5741
03:50:56.023 --> 03:50:57.481
(squeaking)
SAM: Great.

5742
03:50:57.481 --> 03:50:59.198
I'm going to aim right for the heart

5743
03:50:59.198 --> 03:51:02.501
and see if I can aim it so to push the heart through.

5744
03:51:02.501 --> 03:51:03.334
MATT: Sure.

5745
03:51:03.334 --> 03:51:05.327
SAM: Like in some sort of explosive.

5746
03:51:05.327 --> 03:51:06.387
TALIESIN: You're doing well.

5747
03:51:06.387 --> 03:51:08.430
SAM: 28.
MATT: That definitely hits.

5748
03:51:08.430 --> 03:51:12.002
LAURA: Pink and purple flashes everywhere around us.

5749
03:51:12.002 --> 03:51:14.055
SAM: A million points of damage.

5750
03:51:14.055 --> 03:51:16.628
No, just 25 points of damage.

5751
03:51:16.628 --> 03:51:18.138
MATT: 25 points of damage, yeah.

5752
03:51:18.138 --> 03:51:20.311
It was not going to make that save.

5753
03:51:20.311 --> 03:51:23.183
(whooshes) The chest explodes and you see its gray heart

5754
03:51:23.183 --> 03:51:26.410
shoot out, pinned to this wall.

5755
03:51:26.410 --> 03:51:28.030
It's just sitting there.

5756
03:51:28.030 --> 03:51:29.473
SAM: But not a good heart?

5757
03:51:29.473 --> 03:51:30.456
LAURA: No, we need a gold heart.

5758
03:51:30.456 --> 03:51:32.415
SAM: Goddamn it!

5759
03:51:32.415 --> 03:51:34.047
MATT: That was your action, bonus action.

5760
03:51:34.047 --> 03:51:35.233
SAM: That's it.
MATT: All right.

5761
03:51:35.233 --> 03:51:37.302
MARISHA: 10% drop rate or something?

5762
03:51:37.302 --> 03:51:38.371
MATT: Fjord, you're up.

5763
03:51:38.371 --> 03:51:40.550
TRAVIS: With my bonus--
MARISHA: 20% to get a foil.

5764
03:51:40.550 --> 03:51:42.802
TRAVIS: With my bonus action, I'll move next to

5765
03:51:42.802 --> 03:51:45.071
this guy right there.
MATT: Right there, you got it.

5766
03:51:45.071 --> 03:51:46.154
TRAVIS: I will,

5767
03:51:48.881 --> 03:51:52.048
I'll take a swipe at him, the first one, at him.

5768
03:51:52.048 --> 03:51:54.742
MATT: Go for it.
SAM: I'm running low.

5769
03:51:54.742 --> 03:51:55.742
TRAVIS: 26 to hit.

5770
03:51:58.769 --> 03:51:59.900
26 to hit?
MATT: 26 hits.

5771
03:51:59.900 --> 03:52:00.983
TRAVIS: Okay, cool.

5772
03:52:02.759 --> 03:52:04.210
TALIESIN: You could've said something last time we were in--

5773
03:52:04.210 --> 03:52:06.426
TRAVIS: Seven points of slashing damage

5774
03:52:06.426 --> 03:52:08.345
and one point of Hex.

5775
03:52:08.345 --> 03:52:11.808
So eight total on the first one.

5776
03:52:11.808 --> 03:52:14.552
MATT: All right.
TRAVIS: On the--

5777
03:52:14.552 --> 03:52:15.385
MATT: (blasts) You carve through it.

5778
03:52:15.385 --> 03:52:17.100
It's looking really wounded between the unicorns

5779
03:52:17.100 --> 03:52:17.933
that have been attacking it,

5780
03:52:17.933 --> 03:52:19.232
the damage you dealt with your first try,

5781
03:52:19.232 --> 03:52:20.187
but it's still standing.

5782
03:52:20.187 --> 03:52:23.623
TRAVIS: I'll attack the guy behind me, directly behind me.

5783
03:52:23.623 --> 03:52:27.082
The one to his right.
MATT: You got it.

5784
03:52:27.082 --> 03:52:28.834
TRAVIS: 25.

5785
03:52:28.834 --> 03:52:30.077
MATT: 25 hits.
TRAVIS: Yes.

5786
03:52:30.077 --> 03:52:32.403
LAURA: Gold heart, gold heart!

5787
03:52:32.403 --> 03:52:34.054
LIAM: No whammies, no whammies.

5788
03:52:34.054 --> 03:52:36.824
TRAVIS: 11 points of slashing damage.

5789
03:52:36.824 --> 03:52:38.127
MATT: 11 points slashing damage (whooshes).

5790
03:52:38.127 --> 03:52:40.409
You strike through that one and (groans) it takes the hit.

5791
03:52:40.409 --> 03:52:43.113
It's holding on by a thread.

5792
03:52:43.113 --> 03:52:44.505
That finish your go?
TRAVIS: Yes, it does.

5793
03:52:44.505 --> 03:52:47.741
MATT: All right, Yasha, Jester, you guys are up.

5794
03:52:47.741 --> 03:52:50.406
ASHLEY: Go, Jessie.
LAURA: Oh, okay.

5795
03:52:50.406 --> 03:52:51.656
I'm going to...

5796
03:52:55.340 --> 03:52:59.378
I'm going to Sacred Flame one of them.

5797
03:52:59.378 --> 03:53:00.986
MATT: Which one? Pick one.

5798
03:53:00.986 --> 03:53:03.485
LAURA: The one that Fjord was just attacking?

5799
03:53:03.485 --> 03:53:05.002
TRAVIS: Yeah, which one?
MATT: There's two of him

5800
03:53:05.002 --> 03:53:06.038
he just hit.
LAURA: Oh, wait.

5801
03:53:06.038 --> 03:53:06.905
You know what?

5802
03:53:06.905 --> 03:53:09.300
I'm going to do it next to somebody that is

5803
03:53:09.300 --> 03:53:11.425
near one that I can grab if it drops the heart.

5804
03:53:11.425 --> 03:53:13.225
How about the one that's--
MATT: Right there?

5805
03:53:13.225 --> 03:53:14.892
LAURA: Yeah!
MATT: All righty.

5806
03:53:15.982 --> 03:53:18.285
TALIESIN: We need hearts.
MATT: That is a failed save.

5807
03:53:18.285 --> 03:53:22.123
LAURA: All right, that's 2d8.

5808
03:53:22.123 --> 03:53:22.956
MATT: 2d8.

5809
03:53:24.462 --> 03:53:25.879
LAURA: 2d8 radiant.

5810
03:53:26.928 --> 03:53:29.740
Ooh, that's a 12.

5811
03:53:29.740 --> 03:53:30.740
MATT: 12 points?

5812
03:53:32.452 --> 03:53:34.351
Oh, it's still standing.

5813
03:53:34.351 --> 03:53:36.484
SAM: What the shit?

5814
03:53:37.574 --> 03:53:39.897
MATT: Seven plus 12, nineteen.

5815
03:53:39.897 --> 03:53:41.532
It's burnt. The unicorns are attacking it

5816
03:53:41.532 --> 03:53:43.449
and it's still (gasps).

5817
03:53:43.449 --> 03:53:46.197
Its eyes rolling its head to the side.

5818
03:53:46.197 --> 03:53:49.273
So that's your action.
LAURA: (groans)

5819
03:53:49.273 --> 03:53:52.681
(frustrated noises)

5820
03:53:55.003 --> 03:53:56.215
Should I do it?

5821
03:53:56.215 --> 03:53:57.492
SAM: We need some hearts.
TALIESIN: Do what?

5822
03:53:57.492 --> 03:53:59.600
LAURA: Well, I could bonus action

5823
03:53:59.600 --> 03:54:02.051
and cast Spiritual Weapon.

5824
03:54:02.051 --> 03:54:03.462
But I don't want to waste any more spells

5825
03:54:03.462 --> 03:54:05.693
if we have to fight something else!

5826
03:54:05.693 --> 03:54:07.461
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're fine.

5827
03:54:07.461 --> 03:54:08.861
SAM: The unicorns'll finish him off.

5828
03:54:08.861 --> 03:54:10.852
TALIESIN: Yeah.
LAURA: Okay, okay.

5829
03:54:10.852 --> 03:54:11.743
SAM: Yeah.
LAURA: All right.

5830
03:54:11.743 --> 03:54:13.322
Then I'm going to--
MATT: That finishes Jester's go.

5831
03:54:13.322 --> 03:54:14.809
Yasha.
LAURA: Oh, oh, yeah.

5832
03:54:14.809 --> 03:54:16.247
I think I can do that, actually.

5833
03:54:16.247 --> 03:54:17.080
SAM: Oh, yeah.

5834
03:54:17.080 --> 03:54:20.167
LAURA: Wait, let me see if I have my bonus.

5835
03:54:20.167 --> 03:54:21.051
Hold on.
MATT: In the meantime,

5836
03:54:21.051 --> 03:54:22.005
Yasha, why don't you go?
LAURA: Okay.

5837
03:54:22.005 --> 03:54:22.838
ASHLEY: Okay.

5838
03:54:25.082 --> 03:54:28.182
I'm going to attack-- sorry, Fjord, but because he's close,

5839
03:54:28.182 --> 03:54:31.329
I'm going to attack Mr. Hexy.

5840
03:54:31.329 --> 03:54:32.195
MATT: Mr. Hexy?
ASHLEY: Yeah.

5841
03:54:32.195 --> 03:54:33.048
Was that the one you were attacking

5842
03:54:33.048 --> 03:54:34.701
or the one that you said was pretty close?

5843
03:54:34.701 --> 03:54:36.017
MATT: You can't quite get to the Hex guy.

5844
03:54:36.017 --> 03:54:37.553
ASHLEY: Okay.
MATT: You have to move around.

5845
03:54:37.553 --> 03:54:39.531
ASHLEY: Okay, yeah, I'll attack the other one

5846
03:54:39.531 --> 03:54:40.845
that he was attacking.
MATT: Right there, go for it.

5847
03:54:40.845 --> 03:54:41.678
ASHLEY: Yeah.

5848
03:54:42.653 --> 03:54:45.153
TRAVIS: That's actually good for me.

5849
03:54:46.192 --> 03:54:47.877
One last flanked attack for me to do it.

5850
03:54:47.877 --> 03:54:48.877
ASHLEY: Ooh, okay.

5851
03:54:51.020 --> 03:54:52.416
24.
MATT: 24 definitely hits.

5852
03:54:52.416 --> 03:54:54.795
Go ahead and roll damage.

5853
03:54:54.795 --> 03:54:56.649
TRAVIS: Open him up!

5854
03:54:56.649 --> 03:54:57.649
ASHLEY: Come here.

5855
03:54:58.584 --> 03:55:00.167
TALIESIN: Whoa!

5856
03:55:01.639 --> 03:55:02.472
ASHLEY: Okay.

5857
03:55:07.802 --> 03:55:09.667
22 points of damage.

5858
03:55:09.667 --> 03:55:12.223
MATT: 22 points of damage.
TALIESIN: Wow.

5859
03:55:12.223 --> 03:55:14.492
MATT: Okay, he rolled an 18 on his save

5860
03:55:14.492 --> 03:55:16.338
plus three for his con. That's 21.

5861
03:55:16.338 --> 03:55:17.483
You literally just did enough damage

5862
03:55:17.483 --> 03:55:20.542
to prevent him from maintaining his--

5863
03:55:20.542 --> 03:55:22.217
(whooshes) He is slaughtered.

5864
03:55:22.217 --> 03:55:24.385
As the chest is torn open, gray heart.

5865
03:55:24.385 --> 03:55:26.171
(groaning)

5866
03:55:26.171 --> 03:55:27.004
MATT: Sorry.

5867
03:55:27.004 --> 03:55:29.848
ASHLEY: Fuck you, you fucking dead person!

5868
03:55:29.848 --> 03:55:31.723
SAM: Is it the radiant damage?

5869
03:55:31.723 --> 03:55:34.062
MARISHA: I think it's the--
LAURA: It's only radiant damage

5870
03:55:34.062 --> 03:55:35.331
that kills with a gold heart?
TRAVIS: Or magical?

5871
03:55:35.331 --> 03:55:36.164
No, because she has a magical weapon.

5872
03:55:36.164 --> 03:55:38.226
MATT: You still have a second attack.

5873
03:55:38.226 --> 03:55:39.726
MARISHA: But this one was

5874
03:55:41.966 --> 03:55:42.899
killed.
ASHLEY: I'm trying to think.

5875
03:55:42.899 --> 03:55:45.132
SAM: With what?
LAURA: Sacred Flame.

5876
03:55:45.132 --> 03:55:46.461
MATT: Both of these are really badly hurt.

5877
03:55:46.461 --> 03:55:47.930
All of them have been damaged to a certain point

5878
03:55:47.930 --> 03:55:49.017
because of her unicorns.

5879
03:55:49.017 --> 03:55:50.349
ASHLEY: I'll walk up to the Hex guy,

5880
03:55:50.349 --> 03:55:52.919
but it's like I don't want to kill anymore people

5881
03:55:52.919 --> 03:55:56.181
if they're just going to have gray hearts.

5882
03:55:56.181 --> 03:55:57.030
MATT: What are you going to do?

5883
03:55:57.030 --> 03:55:57.978
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll attack the Hex guy.

5884
03:55:57.978 --> 03:55:59.635
MATT: The Hex guy, so you're going to move this way?

5885
03:55:59.635 --> 03:56:00.869
They get an attack of opportunity if you do.

5886
03:56:00.869 --> 03:56:02.586
ASHLEY: Okay.
MATT: All right, so you move over.

5887
03:56:02.586 --> 03:56:06.001
One of the guys swings at you with advantage.

5888
03:56:06.001 --> 03:56:07.757
That's going to be 13 to hit.

5889
03:56:07.757 --> 03:56:10.324
ASHLEY: Nope.
MATT: (whooshes) You shrug it off.

5890
03:56:10.324 --> 03:56:11.157
ASHLEY: Okay.

5891
03:56:14.850 --> 03:56:16.389
23.
MATT: That hits.

5892
03:56:16.389 --> 03:56:17.236
Go ahead and roll damage.

5893
03:56:17.236 --> 03:56:19.372
MARISHA: Same with this one over here.

5894
03:56:19.372 --> 03:56:22.789
TRAVIS: Does her divine fury do radiant damage?

5895
03:56:23.987 --> 03:56:25.491
MATT: Divine fury, they should say,

5896
03:56:25.491 --> 03:56:28.074
I think it does radiant damage.

5897
03:56:29.448 --> 03:56:30.879
ASHLEY: Checking.
MATT: I believe it is.

5898
03:56:30.879 --> 03:56:33.995
If it's radiant damage, that does make a difference.

5899
03:56:33.995 --> 03:56:36.849
TRAVIS: Because it's radiant.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

5900
03:56:36.849 --> 03:56:38.209
While you're raging--
SAM: We just get some

5901
03:56:38.209 --> 03:56:39.960
regular gray hearts?
ASHLEY: Yeah, necrotic

5902
03:56:39.960 --> 03:56:42.755
or radiant damage.
MATT: Yeah, so.

5903
03:56:42.755 --> 03:56:45.705
You're fallen, so I think it might be necrotic.

5904
03:56:45.705 --> 03:56:46.695
We'll double check.

5905
03:56:46.695 --> 03:56:48.005
We'll check and see if it's a choice,

5906
03:56:48.005 --> 03:56:48.886
but, regardless, for now, anyway,

5907
03:56:48.886 --> 03:56:49.963
you roll for your second attack.

5908
03:56:49.963 --> 03:56:50.796
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MATT: Hits.

5909
03:56:50.796 --> 03:56:52.898
What's the damage on that?

5910
03:56:52.898 --> 03:56:54.784
ASHLEY: 12 points of damage.

5911
03:56:54.784 --> 03:56:56.215
MATT: 12 points of damage.

5912
03:56:56.215 --> 03:56:58.148
Does not make the save.

5913
03:56:58.148 --> 03:57:00.621
The hexed creature crumbles on the ground

5914
03:57:00.621 --> 03:57:02.605
and as it falls open, you can see the faint glow

5915
03:57:02.605 --> 03:57:04.029
in its chest on the ground there.

5916
03:57:04.029 --> 03:57:06.937
ASHLEY: Ah, okay, can I grab it?

5917
03:57:06.937 --> 03:57:08.144
MATT: I'll say you can grab it as a free action,

5918
03:57:08.144 --> 03:57:09.802
but that'll be the end of your turn.

5919
03:57:09.802 --> 03:57:12.036
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll grab it.

5920
03:57:12.036 --> 03:57:13.699
SAM: Is it glowing?
LAURA: It's glowing.

5921
03:57:13.699 --> 03:57:14.549
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's glowing.

5922
03:57:14.549 --> 03:57:15.835
MARISHA: Did you kill it with radiant or necrotic?

5923
03:57:15.835 --> 03:57:16.768
ASHLEY: I don't know.

5924
03:57:16.768 --> 03:57:17.601
MARISHA: No?

5925
03:57:17.601 --> 03:57:19.383
ASHLEY: I don't know.
MARISHA: You don't know.

5926
03:57:19.383 --> 03:57:23.653
ASHLEY: I think what I have is necrotic, but I don't know.

5927
03:57:23.653 --> 03:57:25.836
MATT: We'll call that the rest of your move

5928
03:57:25.836 --> 03:57:27.298
in letting you pick that up

5929
03:57:27.298 --> 03:57:28.870
and pull out of the chest in that area.

5930
03:57:28.870 --> 03:57:30.517
ASHLEY: Okay.

5931
03:57:30.517 --> 03:57:31.889
MATT: All right, that ends your go.

5932
03:57:31.889 --> 03:57:33.222
Beau, you're up.

5933
03:57:34.189 --> 03:57:35.991
Beau, you're up.

5934
03:57:35.991 --> 03:57:39.241
TALIESIN: We keep killing them before they die properly.

5935
03:57:40.808 --> 03:57:42.151
MATT: Caduceus, you're on deck.

5936
03:57:42.151 --> 03:57:44.594
MARISHA: Is it radiant damage?

5937
03:57:44.594 --> 03:57:48.198
How about this, I'm going to,

5938
03:57:48.198 --> 03:57:51.448
excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, Yasha!

5939
03:57:53.026 --> 03:57:54.467
TALIESIN: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Yeah, dope.

5940
03:57:54.467 --> 03:57:56.821
Teamwork is dreamwork, baby!
MARISHA: Mm-hm.

5941
03:57:57.746 --> 03:57:59.304
MATT: That one gets an attack of opportunity on you.

5942
03:57:59.304 --> 03:58:00.651
MARISHA: That's fine.

5943
03:58:00.651 --> 03:58:02.484
MATT: Misses you entirely.

5944
03:58:03.341 --> 03:58:06.029
Take it from her.
MARISHA: Thank you, excuse me.

5945
03:58:06.029 --> 03:58:07.882
Pardon me.

5946
03:58:07.882 --> 03:58:08.931
MATT: All right.

5947
03:58:08.931 --> 03:58:10.131
I'll say, yeah. Moving through your friends,

5948
03:58:10.131 --> 03:58:11.789
you can do that.

5949
03:58:11.789 --> 03:58:14.328
You go over and walk through, excuse me, excuse me,

5950
03:58:14.328 --> 03:58:18.076
slam the heart in, into the second bowl (whooshes).

5951
03:58:18.076 --> 03:58:19.609
The second one lights up.

5952
03:58:19.609 --> 03:58:20.947
TRAVIS: Come on!
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.

5953
03:58:20.947 --> 03:58:23.201
SAM: Two-thirds there, guys!

5954
03:58:23.201 --> 03:58:25.263
MARISHA: Anything else I can do?

5955
03:58:25.263 --> 03:58:27.688
MATT: I'll say pushing through, your action to pull it from

5956
03:58:27.688 --> 03:58:29.155
her and put it in there, I'd say you have your bonus action.

5957
03:58:29.155 --> 03:58:32.384
TRAVIS: Look at that big ass cat's paw.

5958
03:58:32.384 --> 03:58:35.010
MARISHA: The one that Jester fucked up

5959
03:58:35.010 --> 03:58:38.148
that's under Frumpkin's claw?
MATT: Yeah?

5960
03:58:38.148 --> 03:58:40.426
MARISHA: Can I look inside,

5961
03:58:40.426 --> 03:58:42.006
see if he's got a glowy heart?

5962
03:58:42.006 --> 03:58:43.691
MATT: Make an investigation check.

5963
03:58:43.691 --> 03:58:45.281
Investigation or perception, your choice.

5964
03:58:45.281 --> 03:58:47.198
MARISHA: Investigation always.

5965
03:58:48.055 --> 03:58:49.555
Fucking ballsacks.

5966
03:58:50.898 --> 03:58:52.775
11.
MATT: 11. Unfortunately,

5967
03:58:52.775 --> 03:58:55.090
it's hard to see. Its chest cavity is not exposed

5968
03:58:55.090 --> 03:58:57.247
through a severe amount of damage. You're uncertain.

5969
03:58:57.247 --> 03:58:58.080
TALIESIN: You know never know what's truly

5970
03:58:58.080 --> 03:58:59.138
in someone's heart.

5971
03:58:59.138 --> 03:59:00.074
ASHLEY: All right, one more to go.

5972
03:59:00.074 --> 03:59:01.827
MARISHA: Okay, that's it.
MATT: All righty.

5973
03:59:01.827 --> 03:59:04.096
That brings us to Caduceus. Caleb, you're on deck.

5974
03:59:04.096 --> 03:59:08.050
TALIESIN: I'm holding my action for the next time

5975
03:59:08.050 --> 03:59:09.643
a whole bunch of them come up.

5976
03:59:09.643 --> 03:59:11.449
MATT: Okay, you got it.

5977
03:59:11.449 --> 03:59:12.334
Staying where you are?

5978
03:59:12.334 --> 03:59:14.090
TALIESIN: I'm staying exactly where I am.

5979
03:59:14.090 --> 03:59:15.504
MATT: Caleb.
LIAM: Caleb doesn't know anything

5980
03:59:15.504 --> 03:59:18.324
about this radiant theory running around the table,

5981
03:59:18.324 --> 03:59:20.366
so I'm going to mush the one

5982
03:59:20.366 --> 03:59:22.194
that is right under the cat claw.

5983
03:59:22.194 --> 03:59:23.232
MATT: Go for it. Roll attack.

5984
03:59:23.232 --> 03:59:24.504
LIAM: Yep.

5985
03:59:24.504 --> 03:59:27.363
That is a 16 to hit.
MATT: That hits.

5986
03:59:27.363 --> 03:59:28.410
Go ahead and roll damage.

5987
03:59:28.410 --> 03:59:30.124
LAURA: I imagine while all of this is happening,

5988
03:59:30.124 --> 03:59:31.481
all of us are going: Is it radiant?!

5989
03:59:31.481 --> 03:59:33.356
Is it radiant?
SAM: For sure.

5990
03:59:33.356 --> 03:59:35.510
MARISHA: Why are some gray!?
LAURA: I don't know.

5991
03:59:35.510 --> 03:59:38.067
We need a gold one. Is it radiant?

5992
03:59:38.067 --> 03:59:40.394
TRAVIS: Caleb is blocking out what all of your--

5993
03:59:40.394 --> 03:59:45.394
MATT: (gasping) It managed to make its save.

5994
03:59:45.581 --> 03:59:48.921
It should be destroyed, but its form is still holding up.

5995
03:59:48.921 --> 03:59:50.568
One hit point.

5996
03:59:50.568 --> 03:59:52.951
TALIESIN: One hit point.
MATT: (undead gasping)

5997
03:59:55.167 --> 03:59:57.675
It's rolling really well, their saving throws tonight.

5998
03:59:57.675 --> 04:00:00.804
LIAM: I'm in a turkey shoot. I'll stay where I am.

5999
04:00:00.804 --> 04:00:02.679
TRAVIS: (stage whisper) Caleb, deal radiant damage.

6000
04:00:02.679 --> 04:00:03.512
MATT: Beginning of their turn.

6001
04:00:03.512 --> 04:00:04.502
Go ahead and roll damage.

6002
04:00:05.385 --> 04:00:06.218
ASHLEY: Yes.

6003
04:00:06.218 --> 04:00:07.784
SAM: (pigeon cooing) Radiant

6004
04:00:07.784 --> 04:00:10.237
LAURA: Goddamn it. Eight, no.

6005
04:00:10.237 --> 04:00:11.592
Yeah, eight points.

6006
04:00:11.592 --> 04:00:14.398
MATT: Eight points, all right.

6007
04:00:14.398 --> 04:00:16.231
It takes eight points.

6008
04:00:18.022 --> 04:00:20.388
Right there, eight points.

6009
04:00:20.388 --> 04:00:23.138
Actually, that one disintegrates.

6010
04:00:24.956 --> 04:00:28.373
No, no, no, that one takes eight as well.

6011
04:00:32.435 --> 04:00:36.519
That one fails. It takes eight points.

6012
04:00:37.776 --> 04:00:39.693
That one disintegrates.

6013
04:00:41.259 --> 04:00:43.953
I think that's-- that's a lot of creatures to hit.

6014
04:00:43.953 --> 04:00:45.817
That one misses.

6015
04:00:45.817 --> 04:00:48.779
So he doesn't even get to save.

6016
04:00:48.779 --> 04:00:52.263
The radiant damage destroys him (whooshes) gray heart.

6017
04:00:52.263 --> 04:00:54.263
SAM: Gray heart. It's not the radiant!

6018
04:00:54.263 --> 04:00:56.088
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.
SAM: Goddamn it!

6019
04:00:56.088 --> 04:00:58.055
LIAM: It's just loot drops, guys. It's loot drops.

6020
04:00:58.055 --> 04:01:00.137
MARISHA: It's just loot drops.
MATT: Seven points of damage.

6021
04:01:02.029 --> 04:01:04.874
Barely holding on.
LAURA: God, my stupid unicorns!

6022
04:01:04.874 --> 04:01:06.449
TRAVIS: You've got to say the keyword before you kill it.

6023
04:01:06.449 --> 04:01:08.068
SAM: That's what it is.
ASHLEY: They're helping so much.

6024
04:01:08.068 --> 04:01:09.738
MATT: This one (whooshes) falls to the ground.

6025
04:01:09.738 --> 04:01:12.677
LAURA: Gold heart, gold heart!
MATT: Gray heart.

6026
04:01:12.677 --> 04:01:15.024
TRAVIS: Ketchup, say ketchup!

6027
04:01:15.024 --> 04:01:16.449
MATT: That's it for them.

6028
04:01:16.449 --> 04:01:19.471
LAURA: What did we do differently?

6029
04:01:19.471 --> 04:01:22.388
Anything?
MARISHA: I think it's just rando.

6030
04:01:24.019 --> 04:01:24.883
SAM: I think you have to say a

6031
04:01:24.883 --> 04:01:27.465
witty one-liner when you kill it.

6032
04:01:27.465 --> 04:01:29.144
TRAVIS: Witty one-liner?
SAM: A witty one-liner.

6033
04:01:29.144 --> 04:01:30.010
LIAM: Why start now?

6034
04:01:30.010 --> 04:01:31.064
ASHLEY: I don't know if I said one, though.

6035
04:01:31.064 --> 04:01:32.852
MARISHA: Hello, I'm Witty One-Liner.

6036
04:01:32.852 --> 04:01:36.660
TALIESIN: Also, entering into the field, so.

6037
04:01:36.660 --> 04:01:38.160
LAURA: Now's your time?
TALIESIN: Yep.

6038
04:01:39.067 --> 04:01:42.168
All of them who are out, so,

6039
04:01:42.168 --> 04:01:45.276
have another round of them just popped up?

6040
04:01:45.276 --> 04:01:46.427
Turn Undead.

6041
04:01:46.427 --> 04:01:49.224
LAURA: Oh, yeah, and some of them came into my thing, too.

6042
04:01:49.224 --> 04:01:51.716
MATT: Correct. We'll do your damage first.

6043
04:01:53.142 --> 04:01:55.180
SAM: Oof, finally.

6044
04:01:55.180 --> 04:01:56.013
LAURA: 15.

6045
04:01:56.013 --> 04:01:58.502
MATT: 15 fails on that one.

6046
04:01:58.502 --> 04:02:03.068
That's another 15, that one fails.

6047
04:02:03.068 --> 04:02:04.985
That one is another 15.

6048
04:02:06.061 --> 04:02:08.754
That one fails, another 15.

6049
04:02:08.754 --> 04:02:11.093
Those are all going to (crackles) burn terribly.

6050
04:02:11.093 --> 04:02:13.001
They look wrecked, just walking into battle.

6051
04:02:13.001 --> 04:02:14.055
As they hit the radius,

6052
04:02:14.055 --> 04:02:17.506
they're being struck with all of these radiant unicorns just

6053
04:02:17.506 --> 04:02:19.849
flesh tearing off. They're trying to pull forward.

6054
04:02:19.849 --> 04:02:22.539
TRAVIS: Angry hamster unicorns.
MATT: You're Turn Undead?

6055
04:02:22.539 --> 04:02:25.161
LAURA: There's one that's fluttering around it's neck going.

6056
04:02:25.161 --> 04:02:27.231
TALIESIN: 17, I want to say.
MATT: That's will, right?

6057
04:02:27.231 --> 04:02:28.398
TALIESIN: That's a 17.

6058
04:02:29.701 --> 04:02:31.923
It's been a while.
TRAVIS: Like little piranhas.

6059
04:02:31.923 --> 04:02:33.994
MATT: That one succeeds with a natural 20.

6060
04:02:33.994 --> 04:02:35.411
TALIESIN: Wow.
MATT: That one.

6061
04:02:36.324 --> 04:02:38.289
TALIESIN: Wisdom.
MATT: Yeah.

6062
04:02:38.289 --> 04:02:40.054
Disintegrated.
SAM: And?

6063
04:02:40.054 --> 04:02:41.718
MATT: Gray heart.
(groaning)

6064
04:02:41.718 --> 04:02:42.551
MATT: This one.

6065
04:02:43.824 --> 04:02:48.245
Su-- no, because that was a natural 18 minus two, so 16.

6066
04:02:48.245 --> 04:02:50.451
That one (whooshes) disintegrates.

6067
04:02:50.451 --> 04:02:52.052
Gray heart.
TRAVIS: Damn it!

6068
04:02:52.052 --> 04:02:53.465
MATT: This one.

6069
04:02:53.465 --> 04:02:57.373
TRAVIS: Say it.
MATT: That is a 19 minus two.

6070
04:02:57.373 --> 04:02:59.649
17, so that one succeeds.

6071
04:02:59.649 --> 04:03:04.649
That one fails (whooshes).
LIAM: (hoarsely) Thank you.

6072
04:03:05.001 --> 04:03:06.727
MATT: Glowing.
TRAVIS: Get that shit!

6073
04:03:06.727 --> 04:03:08.260
(yelling)

6074
04:03:08.260 --> 04:03:13.161
MATT: That one fails, disintegrates.

6075
04:03:13.161 --> 04:03:14.456
Gray heart.

6076
04:03:14.456 --> 04:03:17.181
That one disintegrates.

6077
04:03:20.183 --> 04:03:22.087
Gray heart.

6078
04:03:22.087 --> 04:03:24.254
There's two of them currently standing.

6079
04:03:24.254 --> 04:03:26.939
TALIESIN: Also, and again, everything below us, too,

6080
04:03:26.939 --> 04:03:28.801
for a 30-foot radius and in both pits,

6081
04:03:28.801 --> 04:03:30.468
I get a little bit of a burn for anything--

6082
04:03:30.468 --> 04:03:32.452
MATT: Correct, so.
LAURA: Popcorn.

6083
04:03:32.452 --> 04:03:34.666
TRAVIS: Popcorn.
TALIESIN: Popcorn!

6084
04:03:34.666 --> 04:03:36.193
MATT: My god.

6085
04:03:36.193 --> 04:03:38.948
TALIESIN: I don't have anything, but there's a--

6086
04:03:38.948 --> 04:03:40.712
Got one!

6087
04:03:41.570 --> 04:03:43.969
SAM: Pop pop.
MATT: (laughs)

6088
04:03:43.969 --> 04:03:46.365
(whooshing) There's a scattering

6089
04:03:46.365 --> 04:03:48.488
of little radiant bursts around

6090
04:03:48.488 --> 04:03:51.449
as corpses just start detonating in the vicinity.

6091
04:03:51.449 --> 04:03:53.329
You see a few other faint glows

6092
04:03:53.329 --> 04:03:54.538
that are left there, but vanish

6093
04:03:54.538 --> 04:03:55.578
into the rest of the piles

6094
04:03:55.578 --> 04:03:57.476
as the ground is still writhing.

6095
04:03:57.476 --> 04:03:59.710
TALIESIN: Like sexy mushrooms.
MATT: Filling the gap

6096
04:03:59.710 --> 04:04:01.912
of the spaces of the ones that are now ash.

6097
04:04:01.912 --> 04:04:03.760
You see for each zombie that dies,

6098
04:04:03.760 --> 04:04:05.179
more continue to crawl their way

6099
04:04:05.179 --> 04:04:06.712
towards you in the space.

6100
04:04:06.712 --> 04:04:08.834
All right, so that begins their turn.

6101
04:04:08.834 --> 04:04:11.036
There's two that survived.

6102
04:04:11.036 --> 04:04:13.403
That one's going to attack you, Fjord.

6103
04:04:13.403 --> 04:04:16.299
That's going to be 15 to hit. What's your armor class?

6104
04:04:16.299 --> 04:04:17.588
TRAVIS: 17.
MATT: 17.

6105
04:04:17.588 --> 04:04:19.659
(whooshes) Scrapes off your shield and you knock it away.

6106
04:04:19.659 --> 04:04:22.039
That one's attacking Caduceus.

6107
04:04:22.039 --> 04:04:23.358
That's a 15 to hit, no damage.

6108
04:04:23.358 --> 04:04:25.352
All right, that ends their go.

6109
04:04:25.352 --> 04:04:26.378
Nott, you're up.

6110
04:04:26.378 --> 04:04:27.989
LAURA: Yeah!
SAM: Mage Hand!

6111
04:04:27.989 --> 04:04:32.411
Grab that heart, do some sort of little magic.

6112
04:04:32.411 --> 04:04:34.809
LAURA: David Bowie move.

6113
04:04:34.809 --> 04:04:36.901
SAM: Yeah, yes, exactly.

6114
04:04:36.901 --> 04:04:39.703
TRAVIS: From "Labyrinth?"
(laughter)

6115
04:04:39.703 --> 04:04:41.450
LIAM: It's a crystal.
SAM: Place it

6116
04:04:41.450 --> 04:04:43.296
in the little bucket.

6117
04:04:43.296 --> 04:04:44.776
MATT: It goes into the small dome.

6118
04:04:44.776 --> 04:04:48.739
The third groove fills with light.

6119
04:04:48.739 --> 04:04:50.981
The two standing zombies (whoosh, thump)

6120
04:04:50.981 --> 04:04:52.627
fall to the ground

6121
04:04:52.627 --> 04:04:55.511
and collapse and all the ones that are crawling out

6122
04:04:55.511 --> 04:04:56.975
just go limp.

6123
04:04:56.975 --> 04:04:58.751
Both the door you entered and the door across the way

6124
04:04:58.751 --> 04:05:01.446
(creaking) that one opens up

6125
04:05:01.446 --> 04:05:03.960
and that one on that side (rumbles)

6126
04:05:03.960 --> 04:05:05.536
slides open.

6127
04:05:05.536 --> 04:05:09.009
LAURA: (clapping)
SAM: I did it, guys!

6128
04:05:09.009 --> 04:05:12.092
I figured it out!
TRAVIS: And totally sober.

6129
04:05:13.531 --> 04:05:14.698
How's it feel?

6130
04:05:16.012 --> 04:05:17.048
SAM: Not good.

6131
04:05:17.048 --> 04:05:18.965
Did you steal my flask?

6132
04:05:19.860 --> 04:05:20.827
LAURA: It felt a little good.
TRAVIS: We should

6133
04:05:20.827 --> 04:05:22.209
get out of this room.

6134
04:05:22.209 --> 04:05:25.394
ASHLEY: Wait, so we're leaving. We're going, we're leaving,

6135
04:05:25.394 --> 04:05:27.602
going back the way we came?

6136
04:05:27.602 --> 04:05:29.027
TRAVIS: Before we leave,

6137
04:05:29.027 --> 04:05:34.027
maybe we should just collect ourselves for a short minute.

6138
04:05:34.058 --> 04:05:35.556
LAURA: Take 30 minutes in here?

6139
04:05:35.556 --> 04:05:37.214
What if there's a timer on this door?

6140
04:05:37.214 --> 04:05:40.640
SAM: I'm looking through the door. What's on the other side?

6141
04:05:40.640 --> 04:05:43.820
MATT: Okay, so you glance through.

6142
04:05:43.820 --> 04:05:47.212
There's a little bit of a 30-foot hallway

6143
04:05:47.212 --> 04:05:49.611
before it opens up and you can see that the stone floor

6144
04:05:49.611 --> 04:05:51.560
gets rocky.

6145
04:05:51.560 --> 04:05:54.688
You can see darkness beyond that.

6146
04:05:54.688 --> 04:05:56.742
Your visual radius is cut about 30 feet,

6147
04:05:56.742 --> 04:06:01.127
so you have to traverse further in to see where it goes.

6148
04:06:01.127 --> 04:06:02.210
TRAVIS: We can get out of the room.

6149
04:06:02.210 --> 04:06:03.304
LAURA: Yeah, let's get out of this room.

6150
04:06:03.304 --> 04:06:04.514
TRAVIS: Let's just take a second

6151
04:06:04.514 --> 04:06:06.068
on the other side of the doorway.

6152
04:06:06.068 --> 04:06:08.812
TALIESIN: We're pretty thrashed.
SAM: Okay.

6153
04:06:08.812 --> 04:06:12.632
MATT: All right, so you all make your way out of the open

6154
04:06:12.632 --> 04:06:15.434
door into the next hallway and carefully walk

6155
04:06:15.434 --> 04:06:17.950
to the next area where it opens up.

6156
04:06:17.950 --> 04:06:20.283
You come out onto a somewhat

6157
04:06:21.866 --> 04:06:26.084
broken, mildly uneven, but still flat surface,

6158
04:06:26.084 --> 04:06:30.846
rock, dry, dirt, dust.

6159
04:06:30.846 --> 04:06:35.179
About 15 feet beyond the entrance, it just ends.

6160
04:06:36.234 --> 04:06:39.818
You're looking around this massive natural cavern

6161
04:06:39.818 --> 04:06:43.971
wall to each side, like you're on the edge of a chasm,

6162
04:06:43.971 --> 04:06:45.899
with a slight stone outcropping

6163
04:06:45.899 --> 04:06:48.373
that you've just walked out on.

6164
04:06:48.373 --> 04:06:51.368
It's just shadow around you at all sides except for

6165
04:06:51.368 --> 04:06:54.370
the cavern wall that's behind you that

6166
04:06:54.370 --> 04:06:56.726
continues outward before it vanishes

6167
04:06:56.726 --> 04:06:59.324
into the periphery where the darkness

6168
04:06:59.324 --> 04:07:01.317
takes the rest of your vision.

6169
04:07:01.317 --> 04:07:03.444
At the very edge, you can see what looks bolted

6170
04:07:03.444 --> 04:07:06.330
into the edge of this cliff side,

6171
04:07:06.330 --> 04:07:10.880
a pair of heavy, metallic bolts, like poles,

6172
04:07:10.880 --> 04:07:13.939
with giant, drilled screws and

6173
04:07:13.939 --> 04:07:17.028
metal pikes set into the side.

6174
04:07:17.028 --> 04:07:19.316
Massive chains reaching out into

6175
04:07:19.316 --> 04:07:22.399
a ten-foot wide, elongated iron bridge

6176
04:07:23.272 --> 04:07:26.670
that slightly bows out into the darkness

6177
04:07:26.670 --> 04:07:29.003
beyond your point of vision.

6178
04:07:31.148 --> 04:07:33.648
Other than that, just silence.

6179
04:07:35.512 --> 04:07:37.262
LIAM: Caleb goes and sits

6180
04:07:38.679 --> 04:07:41.864
nowhere near the edge, but walks 15 feet out,

6181
04:07:41.864 --> 04:07:44.896
plants on the ground, pulls a book out,

6182
04:07:44.896 --> 04:07:48.369
and just starts casting Leomund's Tiny Hut.

6183
04:07:48.369 --> 04:07:49.202
MATT: Okay.

6184
04:07:51.248 --> 04:07:55.415
MARISHA: Beau goes to the edge and just gets low.

6185
04:07:57.518 --> 04:08:00.702
Sits on the edge, dangles my feet off.

6186
04:08:00.702 --> 04:08:03.824
MATT: Okay, you look down and beyond the 30-foot radius

6187
04:08:03.824 --> 04:08:06.933
of your darkvision, with it truncated,

6188
04:08:06.933 --> 04:08:09.331
you just see the darkness below.

6189
04:08:09.331 --> 04:08:10.229
MARISHA: Cool.

6190
04:08:10.229 --> 04:08:11.739
TALIESIN: I'm going to sit and meditate.

6191
04:08:11.739 --> 04:08:12.953
I'm going to close my eyes.

6192
04:08:12.953 --> 04:08:16.178
I actually also think I'm going to douse the--

6193
04:08:16.178 --> 04:08:20.928
I'll keep the light spell up for you, I suppose, for now.

6194
04:08:21.822 --> 04:08:24.084
LIAM: We would not have reached an hour later,

6195
04:08:24.084 --> 04:08:26.078
so the Driftglobe has been going all this time.

6196
04:08:26.078 --> 04:08:27.015
TALIESIN: Okay.
MATT: Yeah.

6197
04:08:27.015 --> 04:08:28.367
TALIESIN: I'm going to sit.

6198
04:08:28.367 --> 04:08:31.190
I'm going to close my eyes and I'm going to listen

6199
04:08:31.190 --> 04:08:34.607
very carefully.
MATT: Make a perception check.

6200
04:08:37.416 --> 04:08:40.042
TALIESIN: Natural 20, 29.

6201
04:08:40.042 --> 04:08:43.032
MATT: You listen here, everyone's quietly moved in.

6202
04:08:43.032 --> 04:08:45.781
Beau moved to the edge quietly, sat down.

6203
04:08:45.781 --> 04:08:47.577
Caleb moved to the edge quietly

6204
04:08:47.577 --> 04:08:51.397
opened his book. You just close and listen.

6205
04:08:51.397 --> 04:08:52.814
Absolute silence.

6206
04:08:54.509 --> 04:08:56.607
That weird deafening silence where the eardrums

6207
04:08:56.607 --> 04:08:59.441
seem to almost push in.

6208
04:09:01.177 --> 04:09:02.460
Anybody else do anything?

6209
04:09:02.460 --> 04:09:04.685
LAURA: I'm humming very quietly. You'll hear that.

6210
04:09:04.685 --> 04:09:05.885
ASHLEY: I want to go to the

6211
04:09:05.885 --> 04:09:09.933
edge of the bridge and see how far I can see.

6212
04:09:09.933 --> 04:09:12.460
MATT: About 30 feet of what you can see in your darkvision.

6213
04:09:12.460 --> 04:09:14.639
The bridge, it bows slightly

6214
04:09:14.639 --> 04:09:16.899
as it moves further out, but you're not sure

6215
04:09:16.899 --> 04:09:19.019
how far out it goes, but you can see 30 feet of it

6216
04:09:19.019 --> 04:09:21.529
before it vanishes into the darkness ahead.

6217
04:09:21.529 --> 04:09:22.954
TRAVIS: Anybody up for

6218
04:09:22.954 --> 04:09:25.812
figuring out how far of a drop this is?

6219
04:09:27.384 --> 04:09:29.984
MARISHA: I take out a ball bearing.
SAM: (laughs)

6220
04:09:35.397 --> 04:09:36.878
MATT: You don't hear an impact.

6221
04:09:36.878 --> 04:09:41.068
Instead, you hear (whispering).

6222
04:09:41.068 --> 04:09:44.930
One, 12, hundreds of whispering voices

6223
04:09:44.930 --> 04:09:48.927
all merging and gathering (whispering),

6224
04:09:48.927 --> 04:09:51.039
filling the entire chamber.

6225
04:09:51.039 --> 04:09:52.805
For a moment.

6226
04:09:52.805 --> 04:09:56.120
Your brain begins to get a little muddied from the sound,

6227
04:09:56.120 --> 04:09:57.743
for just a moment.

6228
04:09:57.743 --> 04:10:00.059
I'm going to need you

6229
04:10:01.384 --> 04:10:02.925
to go ahead and--

6230
04:10:02.925 --> 04:10:04.497
TRAVIS: One ball bearing.

6231
04:10:05.429 --> 04:10:07.631
MATT: Make a--
MARISHA: Destroy them all.

6232
04:10:07.631 --> 04:10:09.575
MATT: Make a wisdom-saving throw for me, please.

6233
04:10:09.575 --> 04:10:10.938
MARISHA: A wisdom save?
LAURA: We are straight up in--

6234
04:10:10.938 --> 04:10:12.233
MATT: Yes.
LAURA: The tomb of

6235
04:10:12.233 --> 04:10:14.670
some god right now.

6236
04:10:14.670 --> 04:10:16.337
ASHLEY: Pull your legs up.

6237
04:10:18.306 --> 04:10:19.363
MARISHA: (laughs)

6238
04:10:19.363 --> 04:10:21.140
Natural 20.
MATT: Okay.

6239
04:10:21.140 --> 04:10:22.656
LAURA: Thank god.
MATT: The influence

6240
04:10:22.656 --> 04:10:25.758
of the whispers on your mind, you push it away

6241
04:10:25.758 --> 04:10:27.178
and you back away from the edge

6242
04:10:27.178 --> 04:10:29.742
and the rest of you can hear them faintly.

6243
04:10:29.742 --> 04:10:30.897
TALIESIN: Did I, yeah, because I'm--

6244
04:10:30.897 --> 04:10:31.955
MATT: You definitely pick up on it.

6245
04:10:31.955 --> 04:10:35.232
It started, with your natural 20, it started locally

6246
04:10:35.232 --> 04:10:37.018
to where that ball bearing would have dropped

6247
04:10:37.018 --> 04:10:39.453
and then echoed and expanded

6248
04:10:39.453 --> 04:10:41.723
to fill the entire chasm for a moment

6249
04:10:41.723 --> 04:10:44.021
before they slowly died down.

6250
04:10:44.021 --> 04:10:47.021
TALIESIN: Please don't aggravate the ghosts.

6251
04:10:47.982 --> 04:10:51.090
MARISHA: Didn't know there'd be a pit of ghosts.

6252
04:10:51.090 --> 04:10:53.035
TALIESIN: Let's just--
LAURA: This is a fucking tomb,

6253
04:10:53.035 --> 04:10:54.532
you guys.
MATT: Like it was strange.

6254
04:10:54.532 --> 04:10:56.361
Elements of it sounded like language,

6255
04:10:56.361 --> 04:10:58.676
but none that you knew. Some of it sounded like babble,

6256
04:10:58.676 --> 04:11:00.660
some of it sounded like,

6257
04:11:00.660 --> 04:11:03.291
just like light screams and moans all merging.

6258
04:11:03.291 --> 04:11:05.941
It was maddening, terrifying,

6259
04:11:05.941 --> 04:11:07.811
sourceless.
TALIESIN: Couldn't make anything out?

6260
04:11:07.811 --> 04:11:09.512
MATT: Not without any light, not at this distance.

6261
04:11:09.512 --> 04:11:11.165
TALIESIN: I mean...
MATT: Oh, no.

6262
04:11:11.165 --> 04:11:14.604
TALIESIN: All right.
MARISHA: I don't think we want

6263
04:11:14.604 --> 04:11:16.104
them in our heads.

6264
04:11:23.856 --> 04:11:26.139
SAM: Yikes.
LAURA: I don't like this.

6265
04:11:26.139 --> 04:11:28.222
LIAM: Tenish minutes later (hums)

6266
04:11:28.222 --> 04:11:31.851
and there is a grayish-black dome

6267
04:11:31.851 --> 04:11:35.140
in the rock and Caleb just--

6268
04:11:35.140 --> 04:11:37.149
he doesn't fall asleep, but just lies back on his back

6269
04:11:37.149 --> 04:11:38.094
and rests.
TRAVIS: Do we want to make it

6270
04:11:38.094 --> 04:11:39.502
a long one?

6271
04:11:39.502 --> 04:11:41.303
TALIESIN and LAURA: We can't.

6272
04:11:41.303 --> 04:11:42.136
TRAVIS: Why?

6273
04:11:45.700 --> 04:11:47.179
LAURA: I don't know.

6274
04:11:47.179 --> 04:11:49.949
TALIESIN: I feel like things are--
LIAM: Caleb is exhausted.

6275
04:11:49.949 --> 04:11:52.666
LAURA: I could cast Locate on the guy

6276
04:11:52.666 --> 04:11:54.590
if we're going to do a long rest.

6277
04:11:54.590 --> 04:11:56.815
SAM: Sure.
LAURA: And just.

6278
04:11:57.815 --> 04:11:59.327
TRAVIS: This might be the most chill we get

6279
04:11:59.327 --> 04:12:03.778
before wherever the bridge into darkness goes.

6280
04:12:03.778 --> 04:12:06.084
LAURA: We need to make sure that

6281
04:12:06.084 --> 04:12:09.866
those voices can't get us in the hut, though, because

6282
04:12:09.866 --> 04:12:14.285
they aren't going to stop us from wandering outside of it.

6283
04:12:14.285 --> 04:12:15.118
MARISHA: No.

6284
04:12:17.169 --> 04:12:19.803
LIAM: Just respect the dead.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

6285
04:12:19.803 --> 04:12:22.232
We'll keep watch and watch means

6286
04:12:22.232 --> 04:12:24.649
things from coming in and things from going out.

6287
04:12:24.649 --> 04:12:27.899
LAURA: Maybe we like tie all of us together.

6288
04:12:29.087 --> 04:12:30.574
SAM: Okay.
LAURA: If we go to sleep.

6289
04:12:30.574 --> 04:12:33.157
TALIESIN: That's not a bad idea.

6290
04:12:34.418 --> 04:12:36.668
SAM: Sure, that's a good idea.

6291
04:12:37.635 --> 04:12:38.626
TALIESIN: Yeah, I don't know,

6292
04:12:38.626 --> 04:12:39.949
I'm trying to figure out if I think--

6293
04:12:39.949 --> 04:12:43.684
I don't know if spending that much time here

6294
04:12:43.684 --> 04:12:46.078
is a good idea or not.

6295
04:12:46.078 --> 04:12:49.029
SAM: We don't have much choice.

6296
04:12:49.029 --> 04:12:50.425
LIAM: Well, you're going to be dragging my dead body

6297
04:12:50.425 --> 04:12:53.661
or leaving it behind. I am done.

6298
04:12:53.661 --> 04:12:57.076
TALIESIN: That's fair. That's fair.

6299
04:12:57.076 --> 04:12:59.578
Real quick, Eyes of the Grave one more time.

6300
04:12:59.578 --> 04:13:04.219
MATT: Okay, you focus, no undead presence at all.

6301
04:13:04.219 --> 04:13:05.069
TRAVIS: Can we--

6302
04:13:05.069 --> 04:13:07.497
MATT: You look into the darkness below.

6303
04:13:07.497 --> 04:13:09.362
From the ball bearing and the impact

6304
04:13:09.362 --> 04:13:11.632
or where the impact would have been.

6305
04:13:11.632 --> 04:13:15.073
It didn't go very far before the whispers began to emerge.

6306
04:13:15.073 --> 04:13:17.819
It wasn't like some deep, deep infinite chasm or anything.

6307
04:13:17.819 --> 04:13:19.071
TRAVIS: Can we stuff your ears?

6308
04:13:19.071 --> 04:13:20.762
Our ears?

6309
04:13:23.069 --> 04:13:23.902
SAM: Sure.

6310
04:13:25.465 --> 04:13:28.319
Nothing can get through the dome, right?

6311
04:13:28.319 --> 04:13:31.094
LAURA: Well, we can hear through the dome.

6312
04:13:31.094 --> 04:13:34.248
TRAVIS: That's what I mean.
LIAM: If we keep quiet.

6313
04:13:34.248 --> 04:13:37.440
TRAVIS: I'm sure it won't be total auditory protection,

6314
04:13:37.440 --> 04:13:38.895
but it might help.

6315
04:13:38.895 --> 04:13:40.716
LAURA: We definitely stand guard.

6316
04:13:40.716 --> 04:13:42.888
TRAVIS: Yeah, two up. Everybody else rest.

6317
04:13:42.888 --> 04:13:43.914
LAURA: Okay.

6318
04:13:43.914 --> 04:13:45.487
TRAVIS: And everybody stuffs their ears.

6319
04:13:45.487 --> 04:13:47.002
LAURA: I'm going to--
TRAVIS: Tear off pieces of cloth,

6320
04:13:47.002 --> 04:13:48.536
whatever you need.
TALIESIN: I don't know if

6321
04:13:48.536 --> 04:13:51.167
that's going to help, but do it. I suppose it can't hurt.

6322
04:13:51.167 --> 04:13:55.049
LAURA: I can try a Locate Object, I guess, but I don't know

6323
04:13:55.049 --> 04:13:57.526
what I would cast Locate Object on.

6324
04:13:57.526 --> 04:14:01.070
Maybe something that Obann was wearing?

6325
04:14:01.070 --> 04:14:03.237
SAM: You want to talk to him?

6326
04:14:05.331 --> 04:14:08.812
LAURA: I mean, I could Send him a message, I suppose.

6327
04:14:08.812 --> 04:14:09.645
TRAVIS: Yep.

6328
04:14:15.948 --> 04:14:17.077
SAM: The magic counting fingers.
LAURA: Do we want to

6329
04:14:17.077 --> 04:14:21.700
Send him a message right now?
TRAVIS: Do you want to?

6330
04:14:21.700 --> 04:14:22.776
LAURA: I can.

6331
04:14:22.776 --> 04:14:25.983
LIAM: You could tell him that we are bringing his prize.

6332
04:14:25.983 --> 04:14:27.511
LAURA: Okay.
MARISHA: I'm sure he already knows

6333
04:14:27.511 --> 04:14:28.963
we're here.

6334
04:14:28.963 --> 04:14:31.470
LAURA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: I'm sure he does.

6335
04:14:31.470 --> 04:14:35.398
LIAM: Ask him, maybe, where he intends to meet up?

6336
04:14:35.398 --> 04:14:36.719
TRAVIS: What the hell is this place?

6337
04:14:36.719 --> 04:14:37.552
LIAM: Yeah.

6338
04:14:38.536 --> 04:14:41.703
LAURA: Yeah, okay (sighs).

6339
04:14:44.130 --> 04:14:48.538
All right, I'm going to cast Sending on him.

6340
04:14:48.538 --> 04:14:49.538
MATT: All right.

6341
04:14:53.704 --> 04:14:56.516
LAURA: This place is really scary.

6342
04:14:56.516 --> 04:14:59.099
(laughter)

6343
04:15:01.046 --> 04:15:02.046
We have her.

6344
04:15:04.081 --> 04:15:05.573
How far is it?

6345
04:15:06.708 --> 04:15:08.291
What is this place?

6346
04:15:12.718 --> 04:15:15.718
Did you know there were gold hearts?

6347
04:15:19.687 --> 04:15:21.362
Okay, anyway, bye.

6348
04:15:21.362 --> 04:15:23.605
MATT: (laughs)
LIAM: Goat hearts?

6349
04:15:23.605 --> 04:15:25.522
What about goat hearts?

6350
04:15:28.829 --> 04:15:31.829
MATT: "Ah, yes, I've made my way as well.

6351
04:15:33.755 --> 04:15:35.755
"I'm glad you've kept up.

6352
04:15:37.282 --> 04:15:39.032
"Hope to see you soon.

6353
04:15:39.907 --> 04:15:41.690
"Just be careful.

6354
04:15:43.488 --> 04:15:45.655
"Wouldn't want you spoiled."

6355
04:15:49.191 --> 04:15:52.074
That's all.
TRAVIS: What does that mean?

6356
04:15:52.074 --> 04:15:54.236
LAURA: He said he wouldn't want us spoiled.

6357
04:15:54.236 --> 04:15:56.358
SAM: But you asked him what this place was.

6358
04:15:56.358 --> 04:15:57.374
LAURA: He didn't answer,

6359
04:15:57.374 --> 04:15:58.470
he just said--
SAM: Why not?!

6360
04:15:58.470 --> 04:16:00.656
That was the whole point of this.

6361
04:16:00.656 --> 04:16:04.169
LAURA: He's made his way through. Don't get spoiled.

6362
04:16:04.169 --> 04:16:05.703
Hope to see us soon.

6363
04:16:05.703 --> 04:16:08.370
LIAM: Honey badger don't give a shit.

6364
04:16:09.333 --> 04:16:12.256
SAM: Well, we know we're on the right path, I suppose.

6365
04:16:12.256 --> 04:16:13.089
LAURA: Yeah.

6366
04:16:15.779 --> 04:16:19.156
It's up to you guys if you want to take a rest here.

6367
04:16:19.156 --> 04:16:20.239
TRAVIS: Did you want to Locate,

6368
04:16:20.239 --> 04:16:22.480
or was that the same spell slot?

6369
04:16:22.480 --> 04:16:27.480
LAURA: I mean, I can try to Locate Object on literally

6370
04:16:27.513 --> 04:16:29.348
something he's wearing.

6371
04:16:29.348 --> 04:16:32.013
I don't know if he still has that on or anything?

6372
04:16:32.013 --> 04:16:33.917
TRAVIS: You could try, correct?

6373
04:16:33.917 --> 04:16:36.769
LAURA: If he's in a thousand feet.

6374
04:16:36.769 --> 04:16:39.619
If we're going to stay here.
TRAVIS: We are going to stay.

6375
04:16:39.619 --> 04:16:42.232
TALIESIN: We have to.
LAURA: Well, now.

6376
04:16:42.232 --> 04:16:44.403
All right, I'll cast Locate Object.

6377
04:16:44.403 --> 04:16:45.978
MATT: On?

6378
04:16:45.978 --> 04:16:48.011
LAURA: Like the--

6379
04:16:48.011 --> 04:16:50.635
didn't I see him wearing a cloak or something when--

6380
04:16:50.635 --> 04:16:51.641
MATT: Like a cowl.
LAURA: Yeah,

6381
04:16:51.641 --> 04:16:54.599
I'll Locate it on that.
MATT: Okay.

6382
04:16:54.599 --> 04:16:57.925
Concentrate, clutch your holy symbol.

6383
04:16:57.925 --> 04:17:00.035
Putting out your focus and imagination,

6384
04:17:00.035 --> 04:17:02.201
visualizing that item of clothing,

6385
04:17:02.201 --> 04:17:06.099
visualizing the image of Obann in your mind.

6386
04:17:06.099 --> 04:17:07.568
Nothing.

6387
04:17:07.568 --> 04:17:08.568
TALIESIN: All right.

6388
04:17:09.474 --> 04:17:11.811
LAURA: If he's here, he's not within a thousand feet.

6389
04:17:11.811 --> 04:17:14.724
TRAVIS: God, are we just walking into a fucking--?

6390
04:17:14.724 --> 04:17:17.003
ASHLEY: Is the door closed behind us?

6391
04:17:17.003 --> 04:17:20.670
MATT: It's currently open.
ASHLEY: It's currently open.

6392
04:17:22.300 --> 04:17:27.150
TALIESIN: I'm going to-- we should close the door, I think.

6393
04:17:28.715 --> 04:17:32.003
LIAM: It sounded like he is waiting for us, yeah?

6394
04:17:32.003 --> 04:17:35.122
He knows we're coming. He has the upper hand, most likely.

6395
04:17:35.122 --> 04:17:37.569
We don't want to walk in like this.

6396
04:17:37.569 --> 04:17:39.336
TRAVIS: Were there actually grappling hooks

6397
04:17:39.336 --> 04:17:40.904
and chains in that room?

6398
04:17:40.904 --> 04:17:43.076
MATT: There were chains in there, yeah.

6399
04:17:43.076 --> 04:17:46.083
TRAVIS: Should we acquire some safety rigging

6400
04:17:46.083 --> 04:17:48.856
for whenever we decide to cross this thing?

6401
04:17:48.856 --> 04:17:49.895
TALIESIN: I would say let's take a look

6402
04:17:49.895 --> 04:17:51.254
to see if there's anything useful.

6403
04:17:51.254 --> 04:17:55.480
Don't touch the altar again and

6404
04:17:55.480 --> 04:17:57.897
maybe scour--
LAURA: Oh, gosh.

6405
04:18:00.678 --> 04:18:04.033
What if the minute you walk in, the door closes behind you

6406
04:18:04.033 --> 04:18:06.723
and then you're stuck in that room?

6407
04:18:07.598 --> 04:18:09.948
Send your Mage Hand in. See if it can get some of the chains

6408
04:18:09.948 --> 04:18:11.852
without us going in.

6409
04:18:11.852 --> 04:18:13.925
SAM: It can only go 30 feet.

6410
04:18:13.925 --> 04:18:15.985
LAURA: Well, are there chains right near the door?

6411
04:18:15.985 --> 04:18:17.644
SAM: I don't think so.

6412
04:18:17.644 --> 04:18:18.685
MATT: There's a few sets of chains within

6413
04:18:18.685 --> 04:18:19.932
20 feet of the door.

6414
04:18:19.932 --> 04:18:22.483
SAM: I can only-- okay, sure, I'll try.

6415
04:18:22.483 --> 04:18:24.210
MATT: If you want to, I mean.
SAM: Yeah.

6416
04:18:24.210 --> 04:18:26.945
It can only lift five pounds, though.

6417
04:18:26.945 --> 04:18:28.766
I don't know how much chain that is.

6418
04:18:28.766 --> 04:18:30.397
LAURA: Try it, try to drag it.
SAM: Sure, sure.

6419
04:18:30.397 --> 04:18:32.111
I'll drag a chain.

6420
04:18:32.111 --> 04:18:33.783
MATT: The hand grabs the chain. You pull it over towards you

6421
04:18:33.783 --> 04:18:38.174
and it gets taut. They're all bolted to the walls up top.

6422
04:18:38.174 --> 04:18:39.007
TRAVIS: All right, never mind,

6423
04:18:39.007 --> 04:18:41.290
worth the thought, worth the try.

6424
04:18:44.372 --> 04:18:45.205
We rest.

6425
04:18:46.576 --> 04:18:49.159
SAM: Just kick back with a little--

6426
04:18:49.159 --> 04:18:50.553
TALIESIN: We should--
SAM: -- little whiskey.

6427
04:18:50.553 --> 04:18:53.040
TRAVIS: What, what'd you say?
SAM: A little whiskey.

6428
04:18:53.040 --> 04:18:56.879
MATT: (whispering)

6429
04:18:56.879 --> 04:18:59.599
The whispers and sounds begin to pick up

6430
04:18:59.599 --> 04:19:02.256
at the louder sound of Nott's voice carrying over,

6431
04:19:02.256 --> 04:19:04.833
which faintly echoed through the cavern.

6432
04:19:04.833 --> 04:19:06.599
I need everybody to make a wisdom saving throw.

6433
04:19:06.599 --> 04:19:08.840
(shouting)
SAM: We can't talk loud!

6434
04:19:08.840 --> 04:19:11.665
MARISHA: It's noise in general.

6435
04:19:11.665 --> 04:19:13.351
SAM: Wisdom?
MATT: Wisdom.

6436
04:19:13.351 --> 04:19:15.473
SAM: Save.
MATT: Yes.

6437
04:19:15.473 --> 04:19:17.769
SAM: But we had a--
TRAVIS: 15.

6438
04:19:17.769 --> 04:19:19.967
MATT: Beau?
MARISHA: Ten.

6439
04:19:19.967 --> 04:19:22.171
LIAM: 25.
SAM: Five.

6440
04:19:22.171 --> 04:19:23.962
LAURA: 17.
TALIESIN: 15.

6441
04:19:23.962 --> 04:19:25.409
ASHLEY: Five.

6442
04:19:25.409 --> 04:19:27.020
MATT: Okay.

6443
04:19:27.020 --> 04:19:28.539
The rest of you guys plug

6444
04:19:28.539 --> 04:19:31.933
your ears real fast. And put it in--

6445
04:19:31.933 --> 04:19:36.933
Both Nott and Yasha, the sound pierces your brain.

6446
04:19:37.078 --> 04:19:40.562
The sound of the voice expands into tens, hundreds.

6447
04:19:40.562 --> 04:19:44.272
Screams wailing, whispers, laughter,

6448
04:19:44.272 --> 04:19:45.891
laughter, so much laughter,

6449
04:19:45.891 --> 04:19:48.724
and weird screaming and the wails.

6450
04:19:49.907 --> 04:19:52.490
I am going to, for each of you.

6451
04:19:53.421 --> 04:19:56.055
Okay, so, Nott.

6452
04:19:56.055 --> 04:19:58.787
You guys watch as Nott just--

6453
04:19:58.787 --> 04:20:00.454
just goes catatonic.

6454
04:20:02.337 --> 04:20:04.513
Doesn't react to anything.

6455
04:20:04.513 --> 04:20:07.591
SAM: My last words were whiskey.
MATT: Yasha does the same.

6456
04:20:07.591 --> 04:20:11.050
They both just glaze over for a moment.

6457
04:20:11.050 --> 04:20:12.585
TALIESIN: (shushing)

6458
04:20:12.585 --> 04:20:15.185
MATT: Then you guys come back to.

6459
04:20:15.185 --> 04:20:16.018
SAM: Oh.

6460
04:20:19.634 --> 04:20:21.440
LIAM: You all right?

6461
04:20:21.440 --> 04:20:25.023
SAM: Did we see anything in our state?

6462
04:20:25.023 --> 04:20:26.537
MATT: You rolled a ten, right?

6463
04:20:26.537 --> 04:20:29.084
Actually, technically, you would have had this as well.

6464
04:20:29.084 --> 04:20:30.426
SAM: Oh, boy.
TALIESIN: But wouldn't-- the

6465
04:20:30.426 --> 04:20:34.073
previous save wouldn't have mattered?

6466
04:20:34.073 --> 04:20:35.719
MATT: No, it would not have.

6467
04:20:35.719 --> 04:20:36.719
And you do the same.

6468
04:20:36.719 --> 04:20:38.511
You guys got a little lucky here.

6469
04:20:38.511 --> 04:20:39.834
You all just go catatonic.

6470
04:20:39.834 --> 04:20:41.046
LAURA: Lucky, that was lucky he said.

6471
04:20:41.046 --> 04:20:42.620
LIAM: Did that last about a minute?

6472
04:20:42.620 --> 04:20:45.097
MATT: It lasted for about six seconds.

6473
04:20:45.097 --> 04:20:46.291
LIAM: Six seconds, oh.

6474
04:20:46.291 --> 04:20:49.395
ASHLEY: Did we see anything in that weird catatonic state?

6475
04:20:49.395 --> 04:20:51.480
MARISHA: Did it feel like a stun?

6476
04:20:51.480 --> 04:20:54.295
MATT: It felt like some sort of--

6477
04:20:54.295 --> 04:20:57.176
like in the verbal influence,

6478
04:20:57.176 --> 04:21:01.033
the cacophony of noises going into your mind

6479
04:21:01.033 --> 04:21:02.988
emanating from the pit below

6480
04:21:02.988 --> 04:21:04.664
just found its way into your head

6481
04:21:04.664 --> 04:21:06.872
and you shrugged it off after a moment.

6482
04:21:06.872 --> 04:21:09.655
TRAVIS: Okay, everybody plug your ears.

6483
04:21:09.655 --> 04:21:11.488
Let's go to sleep now.

6484
04:21:12.847 --> 04:21:16.291
TALIESIN: We're going to tie everybody's ankles together.

6485
04:21:16.291 --> 04:21:17.124
LAURA: Ankles?

6486
04:21:18.389 --> 04:21:19.528
(laughs)

6487
04:21:19.528 --> 04:21:23.892
This isn't the Quiet Room. We can talk here.

6488
04:21:23.892 --> 04:21:27.500
LIAM: I pull out my endless silver thread

6489
04:21:27.500 --> 04:21:30.326
and I start to wrap it around everybody's,

6490
04:21:30.326 --> 04:21:31.526
actually, pinky finger.

6491
04:21:31.526 --> 04:21:32.390
LAURA: Yeah, that's better than ankle.

6492
04:21:32.390 --> 04:21:34.698
LIAM: Person-to-person with about four feet

6493
04:21:34.698 --> 04:21:36.479
between each person.

6494
04:21:36.479 --> 04:21:37.863
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: I pull out

6495
04:21:37.863 --> 04:21:41.613
what's left of my family's wine, my wineskin.

6496
04:21:42.641 --> 04:21:45.308
Drink a little, toss it to Nott.

6497
04:21:46.490 --> 04:21:50.768
SAM: You're my favorite person!
LAURA: Shh, shut up!

6498
04:21:50.768 --> 04:21:53.818
MARISHA: Don't--!
SAM: (slurping)

6499
04:21:53.818 --> 04:21:57.275
TRAVIS: What the fuck?
LAURA: Why would you?

6500
04:21:57.275 --> 04:21:59.446
MARISHA: It's the end of the day.

6501
04:21:59.446 --> 04:22:02.889
ASHLEY: I don't know if I want to be attached to you guys.

6502
04:22:02.889 --> 04:22:04.992
SAM: You mean right at this moment?

6503
04:22:04.992 --> 04:22:07.366
Or just like longterm?

6504
04:22:07.366 --> 04:22:10.427
ASHLEY: No, I just mean right in this moment.

6505
04:22:10.427 --> 04:22:11.373
LIAM: Well, you're right in the middle,

6506
04:22:11.373 --> 04:22:13.270
so give me another five minutes to undo.

6507
04:22:13.270 --> 04:22:15.711
ASHLEY: Stop it.
LIAM: And go all the way backward.

6508
04:22:15.711 --> 04:22:17.780
TALIESIN: It might be safer, just in case.

6509
04:22:17.780 --> 04:22:19.359
LIAM: I'll put you on the end this time.

6510
04:22:19.359 --> 04:22:20.192
ASHLEY: I'll be on the end.

6511
04:22:20.192 --> 04:22:21.138
LAURA: What if something happens in our sleep

6512
04:22:21.138 --> 04:22:23.780
and then you wander away, Yasha?

6513
04:22:23.780 --> 04:22:25.020
TALIESIN: We'll need you if one of us wanders away.

6514
04:22:25.020 --> 04:22:26.945
ASHLEY: I'll be on the end. I just don't like being trapped.

6515
04:22:26.945 --> 04:22:28.112
TALIESIN: That's fair.

6516
04:22:30.162 --> 04:22:32.166
TRAVIS: Do I believe her?

6517
04:22:32.166 --> 04:22:34.166
MATT: Make an insight check.

6518
04:22:36.779 --> 04:22:37.612
TRAVIS: 14.

6519
04:22:38.567 --> 04:22:41.954
SAM: Do you like being trapped?
ASHLEY: I don't like being trapped.

6520
04:22:41.954 --> 04:22:44.454
SAM: Do you like killing parents?

6521
04:22:46.152 --> 04:22:49.069
ASHLEY: I just-- you didn't roll anything.

6522
04:22:51.400 --> 04:22:54.813
MATT: All right. You finish preparing that.

6523
04:22:54.813 --> 04:22:56.702
You guys are all within the dome.

6524
04:22:56.702 --> 04:22:58.229
MARISHA: I'll take first watch.

6525
04:22:58.229 --> 04:22:59.899
TALIESIN: Are we going to do a straight sleep?

6526
04:22:59.899 --> 04:23:04.005
TRAVIS: I'll join for that first watch as well.

6527
04:23:04.005 --> 04:23:07.281
MATT: Okay, we'll pick up--
(groaning)

6528
04:23:07.281 --> 04:23:09.099
- at the beginning of the watches

6529
04:23:09.099 --> 04:23:11.878
of your attempt at a long rest in wherever you are.

6530
04:23:11.878 --> 04:23:14.142
LAURA: "Attempt at a long rest."
MARISHA: A terrible idea.

6531
04:23:14.142 --> 04:23:15.773
MATT: Next week.
LAURA: A terrible idea.

6532
04:23:15.773 --> 04:23:17.891
ASHLEY: Yeah, this is not a good idea.
SAM: We're sleeping

6533
04:23:17.891 --> 04:23:20.239
on a doorway to the Abyss.

6534
04:23:20.239 --> 04:23:23.690
MARISHA: Did you burn through all your spells?

6535
04:23:23.690 --> 04:23:24.949
LIAM: I've got one slot left.

6536
04:23:24.949 --> 04:23:26.854
TRAVIS: Actually, I'll take second watch or something.

6537
04:23:26.854 --> 04:23:28.905
I want to keep an eye.

6538
04:23:28.905 --> 04:23:30.797
MATT: Okay, so you can figure out what watches you take

6539
04:23:30.797 --> 04:23:32.545
because you got a week to do so.

6540
04:23:32.545 --> 04:23:34.403
All right, guys, we'll pick up from there next week.

6541
04:23:34.403 --> 04:23:36.813
(laughs)
SAM: Brutal.

6542
04:23:36.813 --> 04:23:38.896
Brutal journey.
MATT: Oh, man.

6543
04:23:41.190 --> 04:23:42.545
Yeah, awesome.

6544
04:23:42.545 --> 04:23:44.508
I'm excited that we have--
TRAVIS: Where the fuck

6545
04:23:44.508 --> 04:23:46.330
did you put us?

6546
04:23:46.330 --> 04:23:48.468
What is this place?

6547
04:23:48.468 --> 04:23:49.590
SAM: Travis!
LAURA: Shh!

6548
04:23:49.590 --> 04:23:50.546
TRAVIS: (yelling) What do you want from us?

6549
04:23:50.546 --> 04:23:52.642
SAM: Travis, no, the whispers!
MATT: (whispering)

6550
04:23:52.642 --> 04:23:55.225
(laughter)

6551
04:23:56.894 --> 04:23:57.727
All right.

6552
04:23:57.727 --> 04:23:58.939
TALIESIN: This is my old house in Glendale.

6553
04:23:58.939 --> 04:24:00.125
It's nice.
MATT: Actually not that far.

6554
04:24:00.125 --> 04:24:02.613
TALIESIN: Yeah, not that far off.

6555
04:24:02.613 --> 04:24:03.726
MATT: Anyway, guys, thank you so much

6556
04:24:03.726 --> 04:24:05.658
for hanging with us tonight.

6557
04:24:05.658 --> 04:24:09.136
Don't forget, we love you very much and is it Thursday yet?

6558
04:24:09.136 --> 04:24:10.192
Good night.

6559
04:24:10.192 --> 04:24:12.942
(dramatic music)

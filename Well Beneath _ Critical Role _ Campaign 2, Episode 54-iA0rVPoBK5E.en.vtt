00:00:00.181 --> 00:00:01.974
MATT: Hello, everyone and welcome to tonight's

2
00:00:01.974 --> 00:00:03.319
episode of Critical Role where a bunch

3
00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:04.905
of us nerdy ass voice actors sit around

4
00:00:04.905 --> 00:00:06.331
and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

5
00:00:06.331 --> 00:00:09.012
SAM: We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

6
00:00:09.012 --> 00:00:11.637
MATT: And deal with this week.

7
00:00:13.343 --> 00:00:14.960
Hi guys.

8
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.051
TRAVIS: Hi.

9
00:00:16.051 --> 00:00:19.624
LIAM: Hi, everybody. Hi, hi. Hi, everybody.

10
00:00:19.624 --> 00:00:23.024
Hi. (clears throat) Oh.

11
00:00:23.024 --> 00:00:24.940
MATT: I don't even.

12
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.713
However, so before we get into all that,

13
00:00:27.713 --> 00:00:29.748
first, we have our fantastic friend

14
00:00:29.748 --> 00:00:31.219
and sponsor of the show since the beginning

15
00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:34.018
of this campaign, our friends at D&amp;D Beyond.

16
00:00:34.018 --> 00:00:34.851
Sam.

17
00:00:34.851 --> 00:00:35.834
(cheering)

18
00:00:35.834 --> 00:00:37.984
SAM: D&amp;D Beyond, guys.

19
00:00:37.984 --> 00:00:39.857
There's only one campaign we're talking about

20
00:00:39.857 --> 00:00:41.562
this week and that's the campaign

21
00:00:41.562 --> 00:00:43.762
for president of D&amp;D Beyond.

22
00:00:43.762 --> 00:00:46.754
(laughter)

23
00:00:48.205 --> 00:00:50.974
D&amp;D Beyond is so behind

24
00:00:50.974 --> 00:00:53.705
this race between me and Liam that they've

25
00:00:53.705 --> 00:00:55.458
added a new feature. You can show your

26
00:00:55.458 --> 00:00:57.253
campaign support for the D&amp;D Beyond

27
00:00:57.253 --> 00:01:00.475
presidential candidates by using the code

28
00:01:00.475 --> 00:01:03.534
of your choice, either ISUPPORTSAM,

29
00:01:03.534 --> 00:01:07.243
all one word, or ISUPPORTLIAM.

30
00:01:07.243 --> 00:01:10.708
Both codes provide a 25% discount off

31
00:01:10.708 --> 00:01:13.440
any full digital books in your cart.

32
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.231
I feel like ISUPPORTSAM should be

33
00:01:15.231 --> 00:01:18.166
25 and a half percent, but whatever.

34
00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:20.002
If you apply one at checkout.

35
00:01:20.002 --> 00:01:22.448
The codes do not apply to the Legendary Bundle.

36
00:01:22.448 --> 00:01:24.973
It can only be used one at a time.

37
00:01:24.973 --> 00:01:29.384
Link is dndbeyond.com/marketplace.

38
00:01:29.384 --> 00:01:30.234
LAURA: No.

39
00:01:30.234 --> 00:01:33.468
SAM: (laughs) Anyway.

40
00:01:33.468 --> 00:01:36.851
I'm so appreciative of this new feature that they added.

41
00:01:36.851 --> 00:01:39.845
I went skiing this weekend with my family.

42
00:01:39.845 --> 00:01:42.957
It was a lovely, wonderful getaway vacation

43
00:01:42.957 --> 00:01:45.158
purely for pleasure, but in order

44
00:01:45.158 --> 00:01:47.687
to make it tax deductible, I shot--

45
00:01:47.687 --> 00:01:52.502
(laughter)

46
00:01:52.502 --> 00:01:57.168
I shot a video for D&amp;D Beyond while I was skiing.

47
00:01:57.168 --> 00:01:58.275
Let's roll--

48
00:01:58.275 --> 00:01:59.400
LAURA: You really did that, too.

49
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.825
SAM: And I will definitely deduct

50
00:02:00.825 --> 00:02:02.456
the entire cost of my vacation.

51
00:02:02.456 --> 00:02:06.831
LIAM: Are you about to use your kids to shill D&amp;D Beyond?

52
00:02:06.831 --> 00:02:09.310
MATT: This is a great thing to do on video.

53
00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.286
SAM: The IRS isn't watching, right?

54
00:02:12.286 --> 00:02:14.360
MATT: This is something that'll show up everywhere.

55
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.671
SAM: If you work for the IRS, I'm just joking?

56
00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:21.427
(laughter)

57
00:02:21.427 --> 00:02:24.366
SAM: But if you don't, I'm not.

58
00:02:24.366 --> 00:02:26.445
So let's roll the new awesome ad

59
00:02:26.445 --> 00:02:29.448
shot on location in Park City, Utah.

60
00:02:29.448 --> 00:02:31.506
(groaning)

61
00:02:31.506 --> 00:02:32.572
SAM: (out of breath) Hey, guys.

62
00:02:32.572 --> 00:02:36.634
D&amp;D Beyond is one of the best apps I've ever encountered.

63
00:02:36.634 --> 00:02:38.061
You can manage your characters

64
00:02:38.061 --> 00:02:40.222
and treasure for your favorite tabletop

65
00:02:40.222 --> 00:02:42.913
roleplaying game, Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

66
00:02:42.913 --> 00:02:43.853
I use it.

67
00:02:43.853 --> 00:02:45.036
You should, too.

68
00:02:45.036 --> 00:02:47.074
If you go right now and subscribe

69
00:02:47.074 --> 00:02:51.229
at dndbeyond/subscribe?

70
00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:52.858
I don't know, maybe that's wrong.

71
00:02:52.858 --> 00:02:54.732
I don't know what it is, it's hard to concentrate,

72
00:02:54.732 --> 00:02:58.238
but if you subscribe, you'll get access

73
00:02:58.238 --> 00:03:01.297
to all their content, which has some

74
00:03:01.297 --> 00:03:04.232
special Critical Role content.

75
00:03:04.232 --> 00:03:08.225
That's right, stuff that you can only find at D&amp;DBeyond.

76
00:03:08.225 --> 00:03:09.058
It's also got all your favorite-- what are they called?

77
00:03:09.058 --> 00:03:10.808
Guidebooks and stuff and literature.

78
00:03:15.254 --> 00:03:19.021
And-- (off balance noises) Whoa! (soft thud)

79
00:03:19.021 --> 00:03:22.937
(panting) Get it, guys.

80
00:03:22.937 --> 00:03:25.586
I'm not a great skier!

81
00:03:25.586 --> 00:03:28.521
That was a green slope, and right after

82
00:03:28.521 --> 00:03:31.849
that happened these wonderful three women

83
00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:33.905
came over to me, so concerned. They were like

84
00:03:33.905 --> 00:03:36.264
oh my god, are you okay, are you hurt?

85
00:03:36.264 --> 00:03:37.978
I was like no no no, it's a bit.

86
00:03:37.978 --> 00:03:40.059
(laughter)

87
00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:44.016
It's a bit, and they got so pissed off.

88
00:03:44.016 --> 00:03:45.442
They were like what?

89
00:03:45.442 --> 00:03:48.741
MATT: And rightfully so, to be fair.

90
00:03:48.741 --> 00:03:50.411
LIAM: There you go, that's all you need to know.

91
00:03:50.411 --> 00:03:53.507
Sam Riegel abusing emergency help on the slopes.

92
00:03:53.507 --> 00:03:55.180
(laughter)

93
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.973
SAM: Yes, but for your entertainment,

94
00:03:56.973 --> 00:03:58.603
which is really what D&amp;D's about.

95
00:03:58.603 --> 00:04:01.009
Not about rules, about entertainment.

96
00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:05.365
So thank you, D&amp;D Beyond, and we will

97
00:04:05.365 --> 00:04:07.737
check in with you next week.

98
00:04:07.737 --> 00:04:09.694
MATT: Thank you, Sam, for showing me what skiing's like.

99
00:04:09.694 --> 00:04:11.448
I've never been and I don't ever intend to.

100
00:04:11.448 --> 00:04:12.669
TRAVIS: Oh, we got to remedy that.

101
00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:14.861
MATT: No, I have no interest!

102
00:04:14.861 --> 00:04:15.727
No!

103
00:04:15.727 --> 00:04:17.068
LAURA: We'll be on the kiddy slopes together.

104
00:04:17.068 --> 00:04:17.901
MATT: (emphatic) No!

105
00:04:17.901 --> 00:04:18.734
LAURA: Yes.

106
00:04:18.734 --> 00:04:21.967
MATT: No! I stay indoors, I build snowmen

107
00:04:21.967 --> 00:04:23.516
out of snow, I throw snowballs, and that's the

108
00:04:23.516 --> 00:04:25.400
extent of my relationship with it.

109
00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.278
LIAM: You will do Hot Pepper Gaming

110
00:04:27.278 --> 00:04:29.395
17 times, but you won't go skiing?

111
00:04:29.395 --> 00:04:30.228
MATT: Yeah.

112
00:04:30.228 --> 00:04:32.528
People die when they ski.

113
00:04:32.528 --> 00:04:33.994
TRAVIS: They die when they eat ghost peppers

114
00:04:33.994 --> 00:04:35.519
and you've done it twice.

115
00:04:35.519 --> 00:04:36.701
MATT: Touche.

116
00:04:36.701 --> 00:04:38.536
Anyway, thank you D&amp;D Beyond.

117
00:04:38.536 --> 00:04:39.369
Thank you, Sam.

118
00:04:39.369 --> 00:04:40.413
LIAM: Everybody's got a thing.

119
00:04:40.413 --> 00:04:41.672
Everybody's got a thing.

120
00:04:41.672 --> 00:04:42.584
MATT: I don't know.

121
00:04:42.584 --> 00:04:43.439
I got too much--

122
00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:44.786
LAURA: Travis has The Ring girl. You have skiing.

123
00:04:44.786 --> 00:04:46.215
TRAVIS: Why, why?

124
00:04:46.215 --> 00:04:47.357
Leave it on him. all right?

125
00:04:47.357 --> 00:04:48.984
(laughter)

126
00:04:48.984 --> 00:04:52.194
MATT: And apparently Madam Musk.

127
00:04:52.194 --> 00:04:54.275
So Travis, do you want to talk about

128
00:04:54.275 --> 00:04:56.146
the other craziness this week?

129
00:04:56.146 --> 00:04:58.443
TRAVIS: Madam Musk, right.

130
00:04:58.443 --> 00:05:01.703
In case you missed the news this week,

131
00:05:01.703 --> 00:05:05.538
we are creating a Vox Machina animated series.

132
00:05:05.538 --> 00:05:07.534
(cheering)

133
00:05:07.534 --> 00:05:10.466
Because of the incredible response to the Kickstarter,

134
00:05:10.466 --> 00:05:13.769
which we are just continuously blown away by.

135
00:05:13.769 --> 00:05:15.764
It's hard to breathe sometimes. We

136
00:05:15.764 --> 00:05:17.884
find ourselves staring quite a bit.

137
00:05:17.884 --> 00:05:19.311
MARISHA: Is this real life?

138
00:05:19.311 --> 00:05:20.370
MARISHA and TRAVIS: I don't know.

139
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:21.535
TRAVIS: I'm not sure.

140
00:05:21.535 --> 00:05:25.401
So far we are up to six 22 minute episodes.

141
00:05:25.401 --> 00:05:26.748
For a little bit of clarity, the first

142
00:05:26.748 --> 00:05:28.539
two episodes of our series will contain

143
00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:30.863
a brand new, original Vox Machina story,

144
00:05:30.863 --> 00:05:32.780
adventure that has never been seen before,

145
00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.059
never been heard, and the rest of the

146
00:05:35.059 --> 00:05:36.773
four episodes that you guys have helped us

147
00:05:36.773 --> 00:05:38.242
get to already will start

148
00:05:38.242 --> 00:05:40.440
the story of the Briarwood Arc.

149
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.845
(growling)

150
00:05:42.845 --> 00:05:44.477
TRAVIS: Obviously the more we raise, the more

151
00:05:44.477 --> 00:05:46.677
episodes we'll be able to deliver.

152
00:05:46.677 --> 00:05:49.491
We did have a special Q&amp;A with the community on Monday

153
00:05:49.491 --> 00:05:53.281
and it is available at youtube.com/criticalrole.

154
00:05:53.281 --> 00:05:55.034
If you would like to learn more about

155
00:05:55.034 --> 00:05:56.949
the campaign you can join it now.

156
00:05:56.949 --> 00:05:59.477
If you haven't, until April 18th

157
00:05:59.477 --> 00:06:04.477
at 11:59PM Pacific at critrole.com/animated.

158
00:06:05.645 --> 00:06:06.586
MARISHA: Crit Role!

159
00:06:06.586 --> 00:06:07.993
SAM: You said that so calm.

160
00:06:07.993 --> 00:06:10.487
LAURA: Critters are amazing!

161
00:06:10.487 --> 00:06:12.737
TRAVIS: I'm try to keep it--

162
00:06:12.737 --> 00:06:16.147
MATT: Here's the thing. None of us expected this.

163
00:06:16.147 --> 00:06:17.763
People say you should've, but this

164
00:06:17.763 --> 00:06:19.831
is in a scale we ever expected.

165
00:06:19.831 --> 00:06:23.054
We're super excited about this series.

166
00:06:23.054 --> 00:06:24.724
This community has come out in full force

167
00:06:24.724 --> 00:06:26.964
and really shown, not just the Critters,

168
00:06:26.964 --> 00:06:30.011
but the tabletop gaming community here and beyond,

169
00:06:30.011 --> 00:06:33.611
and it's overwhelming, it's humbling.

170
00:06:33.611 --> 00:06:36.917
There is so much more out there to support.

171
00:06:36.917 --> 00:06:39.156
Beyond this, and wherever this goes,

172
00:06:39.156 --> 00:06:40.380
people who haven't had the opportunity

173
00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.295
to get engaged, please do, help make it go on,

174
00:06:42.295 --> 00:06:45.196
but also there are so many great creators out there,

175
00:06:45.196 --> 00:06:47.396
there are game designers and artists

176
00:06:47.396 --> 00:06:48.986
and people out there who are a part

177
00:06:48.986 --> 00:06:50.536
of this community that have Kickstarters

178
00:06:50.536 --> 00:06:52.083
and Patreons out there. You can

179
00:06:52.083 --> 00:06:54.407
go ahead and also help support them.

00:06:54.407 --> 00:06:58.339
Go to the hashtag #FunDiverseGames on Twitter

181
00:06:58.339 --> 00:07:01.290
to see a vast number of incredible creators

182
00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:02.881
out there that do not get anywhere

183
00:07:02.881 --> 00:07:05.985
near the attention and support that we do.

184
00:07:05.985 --> 00:07:08.921
This is an opportunity, as this grows

185
00:07:08.921 --> 00:07:11.527
and we grow and this community grows,

186
00:07:11.527 --> 00:07:12.832
there are more and more opportunities for us

187
00:07:12.832 --> 00:07:14.703
to make sure that we can lift up everyone else

188
00:07:14.703 --> 00:07:16.539
around us, and we're committed to that,

189
00:07:16.539 --> 00:07:17.475
and we'll continue to be committed

190
00:07:17.475 --> 00:07:19.677
to that and you guys should, too.

191
00:07:19.677 --> 00:07:22.246
Thank you for all this fantastic support,

192
00:07:22.246 --> 00:07:24.773
and we are but one in a sea of many amazing

193
00:07:24.773 --> 00:07:29.421
people out there, and just pay it forward

194
00:07:29.421 --> 00:07:31.735
and spread it around as much as you can.

195
00:07:31.735 --> 00:07:34.791
As much as you can, don't get too rough on this,

196
00:07:34.791 --> 00:07:37.604
but thank you for everything, and I'm proud

197
00:07:37.604 --> 00:07:39.012
of all the stuff that we can do

198
00:07:39.012 --> 00:07:40.587
for each other going forward, too.

199
00:07:40.587 --> 00:07:43.179
TRAVIS: Yes. Hear hear! Hear hear!

200
00:07:43.179 --> 00:07:44.904
LIAM: There's possibly never been

201
00:07:44.904 --> 00:07:48.686
a better time to be a self-starter than right now.

202
00:07:48.686 --> 00:07:50.153
LAURA: There's possibly never been a better time

203
00:07:50.153 --> 00:07:51.378
to be a nerd.

204
00:07:51.378 --> 00:07:52.211
SAM: Yeah!

205
00:07:52.211 --> 00:07:53.352
TRAVIS: Truth. Truth.

206
00:07:53.352 --> 00:07:55.330
MARISHA: We did inherit the Earth.

207
00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:56.840
LAURA: Yay!

208
00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:57.935
TRAVIS: People that have never heard about

209
00:07:57.935 --> 00:08:00.056
D&amp;D before, RPG gaming, all this stuff,

210
00:08:00.056 --> 00:08:03.848
man, they are paying attention now.

211
00:08:03.848 --> 00:08:06.622
MATT: Thank you guys so much.

212
00:08:06.622 --> 00:08:09.840
Without further ado, I think now is the time

213
00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:14.193
to jump into tonight's episode of Critical Role.

MATT: (deadpan) And welcome back, everyone.

248
00:09:54.976 --> 00:09:58.259
(laughter)

249
00:09:58.259 --> 00:10:01.070
LIAM: Got to keep us all humble, Matt.

250
00:10:02.032 --> 00:10:03.848
SAM: The thing is-- I don't know if the

251
00:10:03.848 --> 00:10:05.148
cameras are on me yet.

252
00:10:05.148 --> 00:10:07.455
Tonight, everyone's so happy that

253
00:10:07.455 --> 00:10:09.620
I felt like I could get away with this.

254
00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:12.679
(laughter)

255
00:10:12.679 --> 00:10:14.970
Because everyone's happy.

256
00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:16.970
It's all a celebration, right?

257
00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:20.301
So he can't do anything to me. I'm untouchable!

258
00:10:20.301 --> 00:10:21.608
Yeah!

259
00:10:21.608 --> 00:10:23.442
LAURA: Nott's going down tonight.

260
00:10:23.442 --> 00:10:24.683
TALIESIN: I, for one, am excited

261
00:10:24.683 --> 00:10:25.974
for your new character.

262
00:10:25.974 --> 00:10:27.114
SAM: Before you start, Matt, I'm sorry,

263
00:10:27.114 --> 00:10:29.149
I forgot to do this in the intro.

264
00:10:29.149 --> 00:10:31.554
New stretch goals, guys.

265
00:10:31.554 --> 00:10:35.019
So we got this flask, normal, normal.

266
00:10:35.019 --> 00:10:36.077
LAURA: Yeah.

267
00:10:36.077 --> 00:10:39.904
SAM: If we hit 7.5, we go up to this one.

268
00:10:39.904 --> 00:10:42.230
(laughter)

269
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:45.535
And if we get to 8.8.

270
00:10:45.535 --> 00:10:47.152
TRAVIS: What the fuck?

271
00:10:47.152 --> 00:10:48.777
(laughter)

272
00:10:48.777 --> 00:10:50.426
SAM: It's this one.

273
00:10:50.426 --> 00:10:53.583
Those are the stretch goals.

274
00:10:53.583 --> 00:10:54.765
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) Where were you hiding that?

275
00:10:54.765 --> 00:10:56.736
SAM: This is a four gallon flask.

276
00:10:56.736 --> 00:10:58.203
LAURA: Oh no!

277
00:10:58.203 --> 00:11:02.114
SAM: Holds 28 bottles of wine or something like that.

278
00:11:02.114 --> 00:11:05.010
You won't even be able to see my face!

279
00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:07.235
MATT: Well, in that case, let's definitely

280
00:11:07.235 --> 00:11:09.951
try and do it for that.

281
00:11:09.951 --> 00:11:12.168
SAM: These were sent in by some wonderful Critters,

282
00:11:12.168 --> 00:11:13.718
whose names I don't have in front of me,

283
00:11:13.718 --> 00:11:16.579
but thank you for these amazing flasks.

284
00:11:16.579 --> 00:11:21.261
I don't know why people would even make a flask this big.

285
00:11:21.261 --> 00:11:23.216
If someone can find a bigger one,

286
00:11:23.216 --> 00:11:26.162
I'll put it on the show.

287
00:11:26.162 --> 00:11:28.719
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

288
00:11:28.719 --> 00:11:30.569
MATT: Last we left off.

289
00:11:30.569 --> 00:11:32.769
LIAM: Oh boy.

290
00:11:32.769 --> 00:11:34.691
MATT: The Mighty Nein are making their way

291
00:11:34.691 --> 00:11:37.218
across the eastern wastes of Xhorhas.

292
00:11:37.218 --> 00:11:41.301
In search of the kidnapped husband of Nott, Yeza.

293
00:11:42.269 --> 00:11:44.914
Discarded in a past life with the death

294
00:11:44.914 --> 00:11:48.339
and reincarnation of Nott not too long before,

295
00:11:48.339 --> 00:11:50.624
and hearing that him getting caught up in the

296
00:11:50.624 --> 00:11:54.013
conflict between the Dwendalian Empire and Xhorhas.

297
00:11:54.013 --> 00:11:57.393
You've gone to hunt down his location and seem

298
00:11:57.393 --> 00:11:59.998
to have pinpointed it somewhere near or in

299
00:11:59.998 --> 00:12:04.165
Ghor Dranas, the capital city of the Kryn Dynasty.

300
00:12:05.212 --> 00:12:06.640
You made your way onto the mountains

301
00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.659
of the Ashkeeper Peaks, battled through the wastes,

302
00:12:09.659 --> 00:12:11.617
and interacted with a number of the denizens

303
00:12:11.617 --> 00:12:14.189
of Asarius, the city of beasts.

304
00:12:14.189 --> 00:12:16.799
Here, under the Kryn Dynasty, you have

305
00:12:16.799 --> 00:12:19.035
come to discover a society that is

306
00:12:19.035 --> 00:12:21.832
not held by humans, dwarves, elves,

307
00:12:21.832 --> 00:12:25.325
but by gnolls, bugbears, goblins, kobolds,

308
00:12:25.325 --> 00:12:29.112
and, of course, the ruling drow, it seems,

309
00:12:29.112 --> 00:12:32.702
the dark elves of the Kryn Dynasty.

310
00:12:32.702 --> 00:12:35.472
You made some friends, you made a trade and paid

311
00:12:35.472 --> 00:12:39.522
for three Moorbounder beasts to aid you

312
00:12:39.522 --> 00:12:41.518
in your travel eastward towards the capital.

313
00:12:41.518 --> 00:12:43.150
You trained with them.

314
00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:45.965
Successfully for the most part.

315
00:12:45.965 --> 00:12:48.882
You begin to discover strange rifts that began

316
00:12:51.572 --> 00:12:53.216
to spring up and lurk beneath the city

317
00:12:53.216 --> 00:12:56.080
that were allowing various entities

318
00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:59.274
from the abyss to begin to harass

319
00:12:59.274 --> 00:13:02.703
and encroach upon Asarius itself.

320
00:13:02.703 --> 00:13:05.332
You spoke with one of these Kryn

321
00:13:05.332 --> 00:13:08.996
representatives here in this city.

322
00:13:08.996 --> 00:13:10.709
She notified you that there were

323
00:13:10.709 --> 00:13:12.212
two goals here you could achieve,

324
00:13:12.212 --> 00:13:15.454
one is to search for a perceived spy

325
00:13:15.454 --> 00:13:17.217
from the Dwendalian Empire that existed

326
00:13:17.217 --> 00:13:18.972
in the Four Corners, or involved

327
00:13:18.972 --> 00:13:21.253
somewhat with the Four Corners tavern.

328
00:13:21.253 --> 00:13:23.160
And to find the source of this

329
00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:26.465
demonic incursion and snuff it out.

330
00:13:26.465 --> 00:13:29.481
Pay for both, but for the incursion,

331
00:13:29.481 --> 00:13:33.948
perhaps pay, or a favor with the

332
00:13:33.948 --> 00:13:36.290
dynasty itself in the capital.

333
00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:39.144
You began your first search, going to

334
00:13:39.144 --> 00:13:41.529
the Four Corners bar under the guise

335
00:13:41.529 --> 00:13:43.909
of the various unique and eclectic individuals

336
00:13:43.909 --> 00:13:47.826
that seem to exist and impermeate this society.

337
00:13:48.951 --> 00:13:51.586
You found one of these drow figures

338
00:13:51.586 --> 00:13:53.430
that caught your attention and attempted

339
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:55.672
to communicate and try and

340
00:13:55.672 --> 00:13:58.814
gather some information from them.

341
00:13:58.814 --> 00:14:00.280
You also threw down the gauntlet,

342
00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.604
both Beau and Jester, into the Four Corner's

343
00:14:02.604 --> 00:14:05.457
gravel pit, which was a four person,

344
00:14:05.457 --> 00:14:07.416
battle royale, weapons allowed,

345
00:14:07.416 --> 00:14:09.820
possibly to the death based on what antes

346
00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:12.430
were placed in the center of this battlefield.

347
00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:14.142
In this fight, in which you were also

348
00:14:14.142 --> 00:14:16.427
joined by a large ogre, still somewhat

349
00:14:16.427 --> 00:14:18.018
damaged from his previous fight,

350
00:14:18.018 --> 00:14:19.689
but arrogantly accepting that he could

351
00:14:19.689 --> 00:14:23.713
probably still take you down, and this dark elf

352
00:14:23.713 --> 00:14:26.985
you had previously harassed upon your entry.

353
00:14:26.985 --> 00:14:30.492
In this fight, Jester fell unconscious.

354
00:14:30.492 --> 00:14:32.691
The ogre fell unconscious, and in the showdown

355
00:14:32.691 --> 00:14:34.684
between this drow with a somewhat

356
00:14:34.684 --> 00:14:38.101
familiar fight style, Beau also too fell.

357
00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:43.774
However, this figure also invited you to meet them

358
00:14:43.774 --> 00:14:46.268
in an alleyway not far from the city.

359
00:14:46.268 --> 00:14:48.870
Half the party followed, the other half got completely lost.

360
00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:51.661
(laughter)

361
00:14:51.661 --> 00:14:52.494
SAM: And are still--

362
00:14:52.494 --> 00:14:54.745
MATT: And are still lost, wandering a space

363
00:14:54.745 --> 00:14:57.115
they are unfamiliar with amongst creatures

364
00:14:57.115 --> 00:15:01.116
that may or may not be amiable to your presence.

365
00:15:01.116 --> 00:15:03.057
TRAVIS: Nope. No problems.

366
00:15:03.057 --> 00:15:05.101
Those of you that made it, you followed

367
00:15:05.101 --> 00:15:08.890
this drow into a nearby small storage shed.

368
00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:11.333
Upon which it was revealed that this was

369
00:15:11.333 --> 00:15:15.735
some sort of illusion or physical transmutation.

370
00:15:15.735 --> 00:15:19.236
And there before you you saw Dairon.

371
00:15:19.236 --> 00:15:22.628
The beautiful, dark-skinned, shaved head,

372
00:15:22.628 --> 00:15:25.483
long-eared elf monk of the Cobalt Soul,

373
00:15:25.483 --> 00:15:27.723
and for lack of a better term,

374
00:15:27.723 --> 00:15:31.512
the Expositor caseworker of Beauregard.

375
00:15:31.512 --> 00:15:32.964
TALIESIN: Social worker?

376
00:15:32.964 --> 00:15:33.797
MATT: Kind of.

377
00:15:35.303 --> 00:15:37.386
That's where we left off.

378
00:15:38.522 --> 00:15:41.091
If I recall, the ones that made it to this

379
00:15:41.091 --> 00:15:43.942
were Beau, Jester, and Caleb.

380
00:15:43.942 --> 00:15:44.961
TRAVIS: (laughs sadly)

381
00:15:44.961 --> 00:15:47.122
While the rest of you, along with Yasha--

382
00:15:47.122 --> 00:15:48.519
TRAVIS: Cacaw!

383
00:15:48.519 --> 00:15:51.599
MATT: --are wandering aimlessly.

384
00:15:51.599 --> 00:15:53.761
In this enclosed space, pressed up against

385
00:15:53.761 --> 00:15:55.645
the dark wooden walls, the smell of

386
00:15:55.645 --> 00:15:59.573
musty rice and grain and what may also

387
00:15:59.573 --> 00:16:01.379
have been a previously kept amount

388
00:16:01.379 --> 00:16:03.414
of tobacco that has left this kind of pungent stench

389
00:16:03.414 --> 00:16:06.224
that is slowly fading as time goes on.

390
00:16:06.224 --> 00:16:07.891
Dairon looks to you.

391
00:16:09.162 --> 00:16:12.162
"So what the hell are you doing here?"

392
00:16:15.809 --> 00:16:18.585
LAURA: We can trust her, right?

393
00:16:18.585 --> 00:16:20.131
MARISHA: Yeah, of course.

394
00:16:20.131 --> 00:16:22.231
LIAM: Who is "her"? Who is this?

395
00:16:22.231 --> 00:16:25.368
MARISHA: This is my mentor.

396
00:16:25.368 --> 00:16:26.699
MATT: "Who are these people?

397
00:16:26.699 --> 00:16:28.371
"Who are these individuals?"

398
00:16:28.371 --> 00:16:30.296
LAURA: Hiiiiiiii.

399
00:16:30.296 --> 00:16:31.462
MARISHA: This is the group.

400
00:16:31.462 --> 00:16:32.441
LAURA: I'm Jester.

401
00:16:32.441 --> 00:16:33.948
MARISHA: That's Jester.

402
00:16:33.948 --> 00:16:35.662
And that's Caleb.

403
00:16:35.662 --> 00:16:37.862
LIAM: Widogast.

404
00:16:37.862 --> 00:16:39.712
MARISHA: Widogast.

405
00:16:39.712 --> 00:16:43.040
This is the group I've been working with.

406
00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.200
We've been doing good things.

407
00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:48.955
MATT: "Good things like traveling into enemy territory?"

408
00:16:48.955 --> 00:16:50.994
MARISHA: Yeah, well, we're looking for someone

409
00:16:50.994 --> 00:16:54.777
who was abducted by the Kryn army.

410
00:16:56.543 --> 00:16:58.679
A friend of ours who's also...

411
00:16:59.804 --> 00:17:02.042
Where's Nott? Where is everybody else?

412
00:17:02.042 --> 00:17:03.996
I thought they were right behind us.

413
00:17:03.996 --> 00:17:07.177
LARUA: I don't know. They disappeared after we left the bar.

414
00:17:07.177 --> 00:17:09.701
LIAM: There was a bit of a fray at the end there.

415
00:17:09.701 --> 00:17:11.907
MARISHA: The other ones that are coming.

416
00:17:11.907 --> 00:17:13.906
MATT: "If you have the rest of your friends with you,

417
00:17:13.906 --> 00:17:17.904
"I'm very hopeful they have not disappeared."

418
00:17:17.904 --> 00:17:19.531
MARISHA: What are you doing here?

419
00:17:19.531 --> 00:17:21.531
LAURA: Caleb, send a message.

420
00:17:22.385 --> 00:17:23.811
LIAM: Yeah.

421
00:17:23.811 --> 00:17:24.644
<i>Ja.</i>

422
00:17:25.603 --> 00:17:27.760
I pull out the wire and hold it up

423
00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.783
to my mouth and I aim towards the door

424
00:17:29.783 --> 00:17:34.759
and say: Nott, make your way back to the bar,

425
00:17:34.759 --> 00:17:37.614
the same bar, and wait for us there, okay?

426
00:17:37.614 --> 00:17:38.838
I will come find you.

427
00:17:38.838 --> 00:17:41.255
Reply to this message, please.

428
00:17:42.141 --> 00:17:43.122
SAM: Do I hear it?

429
00:17:43.122 --> 00:17:45.020
He has to point it in my direction.

430
00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:45.853
MATT: Yeah.

431
00:17:46.762 --> 00:17:49.653
At first, to you there's no response.

432
00:17:49.653 --> 00:17:51.612
You gather the base direction of where

433
00:17:51.612 --> 00:17:53.244
the bar was and in the second attempt,

434
00:17:53.244 --> 00:17:54.711
you do manage to get through.

435
00:17:54.711 --> 00:17:56.098
LIAM: Okay, so I repeat

436
00:17:56.098 --> 00:17:57.688
something like that the second time.

437
00:17:57.688 --> 00:17:59.036
SAM: Oh wait, where are you again?

438
00:17:59.036 --> 00:18:01.869
Sorry, we're behind the bar, what?

439
00:18:04.124 --> 00:18:06.285
LIAM: Jester, Beauregard and I are with

440
00:18:06.285 --> 00:18:09.298
a friend of Beauregard's not too far away.

441
00:18:09.298 --> 00:18:11.339
You're at the bar now?

442
00:18:11.339 --> 00:18:13.656
Reply to this message, <i>bitte.</i>

443
00:18:13.656 --> 00:18:17.042
SAM: No, no, we left the bar. We went in the back alley.

444
00:18:17.042 --> 00:18:19.591
There's some barrels.

445
00:18:21.246 --> 00:18:23.492
I'm trying to see if there's a street sign.

446
00:18:23.492 --> 00:18:24.918
You can reply to this message.

447
00:18:24.918 --> 00:18:26.628
TRAVIS: Is that Caleb?

448
00:18:26.628 --> 00:18:28.220
SAM: Yeah, of course, who else would it be?

449
00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:29.606
TRAVIS: I don't know who you know.

450
00:18:29.606 --> 00:18:31.278
TALIESIN: Can we reply to that message, or was that

451
00:18:31.278 --> 00:18:33.765
just the reply to another replied message?

452
00:18:33.765 --> 00:18:35.849
SAM: I don't remember anymore, but I'm just

453
00:18:35.849 --> 00:18:38.255
going to keep casting Message over and over again.

454
00:18:38.255 --> 00:18:39.845
(laughter)

455
00:18:39.845 --> 00:18:42.415
LIAM: I apologize, one moment.

456
00:18:42.415 --> 00:18:44.570
We are not too far from the bar, in fact

457
00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:46.322
we are only a few blocks away but--

458
00:18:46.322 --> 00:18:48.563
LAURA: It was just a little down and then it was a left.

459
00:18:48.563 --> 00:18:50.439
Tell him you take a left and then you take a right.

460
00:18:50.439 --> 00:18:51.905
MARISHA: It was the second alley after--

461
00:18:51.905 --> 00:18:53.580
LAURA: I think there was a store that had--

462
00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:54.804
MATT: "Shh, keep it down."

463
00:18:54.804 --> 00:18:56.109
SAM: I can't see the sun, so I don't know

464
00:18:56.109 --> 00:18:58.754
which way's north, but can you clap?

465
00:18:58.754 --> 00:19:01.279
Clap really loud or something so we know where you are.

466
00:19:01.279 --> 00:19:03.441
LIAM: I'm not going to do that.

467
00:19:03.441 --> 00:19:05.809
LAURA: Caleb, talk quieter. We have to be quiet.

468
00:19:05.809 --> 00:19:08.159
LIAM: Go to the bar and wait--

469
00:19:08.159 --> 00:19:09.550
SAM: Go in the bar.

470
00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:11.300
LIAM: Go to the front of the bar

471
00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:12.891
and I am going to meet you there.

472
00:19:12.891 --> 00:19:14.317
SAM: Front of the bar, meet you there.

473
00:19:14.317 --> 00:19:16.148
We're going to meet them at the front of the bar.

474
00:19:16.148 --> 00:19:17.207
TRAVIS: At the front door?

475
00:19:17.207 --> 00:19:18.590
LAURA: Are you leaving right now, Caleb?

476
00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:19.894
TRAVIS: We got to go through the bar?

477
00:19:19.894 --> 00:19:20.727
SAM: Yeah.

478
00:19:20.727 --> 00:19:22.340
TALIESIN: Why don't we just walk around?

479
00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:25.152
SAM: We can do that. Let's go around.

480
00:19:25.152 --> 00:19:26.374
TRAVIS: Yeah, we'll walk around the bar.

481
00:19:26.374 --> 00:19:29.270
SAM: We're going to go around the bar.

482
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:31.794
And meet you at the front door.

483
00:19:31.794 --> 00:19:33.986
TRAVIS: Ask him, is it just him?

484
00:19:33.986 --> 00:19:36.642
SAM: Just you? You can reply to this message.

485
00:19:36.642 --> 00:19:38.472
LIAM: I am with a group of people,

486
00:19:38.472 --> 00:19:39.696
including people you know,

487
00:19:39.696 --> 00:19:41.449
but I am coming by myself, stay there.

488
00:19:41.449 --> 00:19:42.282
MARISHA: We'll wait.

489
00:19:42.282 --> 00:19:44.259
LAURA: Oh god, this is such-- everybody's had

490
00:19:44.259 --> 00:19:47.354
this text conversation in the past.

491
00:19:47.354 --> 00:19:49.307
SAM: You stay there, we're going to move, all right.

492
00:19:49.307 --> 00:19:50.408
TRAVIS: We're going somewhere else?

493
00:19:50.408 --> 00:19:51.629
SAM: We're going to go around the bar.

494
00:19:51.629 --> 00:19:52.462
TRAVIS: Oh, to the front.

495
00:19:52.462 --> 00:19:54.686
SAM: Yeah. They're saving us seats for the movie.

496
00:19:54.686 --> 00:19:57.069
MARISHA: We'll hold off on the important bits. Go.

497
00:19:57.069 --> 00:19:58.313
LIAM: I'll be right back.

498
00:19:58.313 --> 00:20:01.341
MATT: Dairon is staring right through you, Beauregard,

499
00:20:01.341 --> 00:20:02.658
and going--

500
00:20:04.065 --> 00:20:05.655
MARISHA: What? Why are you looking at me like that?

501
00:20:05.655 --> 00:20:09.379
MATT: "These are your companions for a

502
00:20:09.379 --> 00:20:11.071
"mission to infiltrate?"

503
00:20:11.071 --> 00:20:12.581
MARISHA: Yeah, they're fucking great.

504
00:20:12.581 --> 00:20:15.310
We were pirates for like three months.

505
00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:18.727
LAURA: Yeah, we were really good pirates. Super duper good.

506
00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.073
MATT: "All right."

507
00:20:21.073 --> 00:20:22.973
MARISHA: You should've seen what we did.

508
00:20:22.973 --> 00:20:24.033
TRAVIS: "Fucking great."

509
00:20:24.033 --> 00:20:26.357
LIAM: Anyway, I am going to go outside now. <i>Tschüss.</i>

510
00:20:26.357 --> 00:20:27.620
I leave and head towards the bar.

511
00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:29.041
MATT: You do notice also the shed

512
00:20:29.041 --> 00:20:31.812
can maybe contain the four of you.

513
00:20:31.812 --> 00:20:35.689
LAURA: Do you have somewhere bigger we can meet?

514
00:20:35.689 --> 00:20:38.584
MARISHA: Is this where you've been staying?

515
00:20:38.584 --> 00:20:40.217
MATT: "No, but it was the closest place I can

516
00:20:40.217 --> 00:20:43.017
"think of which it would be most private."

517
00:20:43.017 --> 00:20:43.850
MARISHA: Okay.

518
00:20:45.066 --> 00:20:45.899
MATT: "And because the Four Corners Tavern

519
00:20:45.899 --> 00:20:46.732
"exterior huts are very open. Anyway.

520
00:20:53.542 --> 00:20:55.903
"So you're searching for someone,

"this person who was taken, you say?"

522
00:20:58.227 --> 00:21:00.343
MARISHA: Yeah, a friend of ours. Her husband.

523
00:21:01.976 --> 00:21:03.393
LAURA In Ghor Dranas.

524
00:21:05.346 --> 00:21:06.462
MARISHA: They were taken by a few wizardly-looking

525
00:21:06.462 --> 00:21:09.604
type of people. Mages.

526
00:21:09.604 --> 00:21:12.846
LAURA: Were they taken by the mages, or were they taken

527
00:21:12.846 --> 00:21:17.580
by the Kryn because the mages were interested in them?

528
00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:18.879
MARISHA: Feels like they could be potentially

529
00:21:18.879 --> 00:21:20.717
one and the same.

530
00:21:20.717 --> 00:21:22.717
MATT: "Which mages took them?"

531
00:21:24.059 --> 00:21:25.200
MARISHA: I wrote notes.

532
00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:27.438
LAURA: There was an old guy, and there was also

533
00:21:27.438 --> 00:21:31.675
this lady who looked a little intimidating.

534
00:21:31.675 --> 00:21:33.258
MATT: "Is this on the Dynasty side,

535
00:21:33.258 --> 00:21:35.054
"or is this in the Empire?"

536
00:21:35.054 --> 00:21:37.132
LAURA: See, I think that was the Empire side.

537
00:21:37.132 --> 00:21:38.723
I'm not actually from either place,

538
00:21:38.723 --> 00:21:42.301
so it's hard for me to know exactly.

539
00:21:42.301 --> 00:21:43.884
MATT: "Very interesting."

540
00:21:44.831 --> 00:21:47.498
LAURA: Yeah, they're from the Empire.

541
00:21:48.336 --> 00:21:51.836
I think the Kryn took him away from them.

542
00:21:54.043 --> 00:21:54.938
MATT: "All right."

543
00:21:54.938 --> 00:21:57.470
MARISHA: But the Empire people seemed to have interest.

544
00:21:57.470 --> 00:22:02.470
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. He was studying-- what's that word?

545
00:22:02.487 --> 00:22:04.932
About the time stuff, dunim...

546
00:22:04.932 --> 00:22:09.182
MATT: "Dunamancy, yes, that is a specialty of the Kryn.

547
00:22:11.034 --> 00:22:14.226
"Do you know which individuals this was? Do you have names?"

548
00:22:14.226 --> 00:22:16.342
MARISHA: Yeah, Lady Vess DeRogna

549
00:22:16.342 --> 00:22:20.508
and Archmage Ludinus Da'leth.

550
00:22:20.508 --> 00:22:25.508
MATT: "(chuckles) Of course it would be. All right."

551
00:22:25.723 --> 00:22:27.556
MARISHA: What does that mean?

552
00:22:28.532 --> 00:22:31.800
MATT: "I have my own business here, and it seems maybe

553
00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.858
"parts of our paths are not entirely disparate."

554
00:22:34.858 --> 00:22:35.691
LAURA: Do you work for them?

555
00:22:35.691 --> 00:22:37.099
Tell me you don't work for them.

556
00:22:37.099 --> 00:22:38.320
MATT: "No, I do not work for them."

557
00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:39.153
LAURA: Okay.

558
00:22:40.151 --> 00:22:43.489
MARISHA: The Cobalt Reserve and the Cerberus Assembly

559
00:22:43.489 --> 00:22:46.638
disagree on many things.

560
00:22:46.638 --> 00:22:47.471
LAURA: Oh!

561
00:22:50.978 --> 00:22:54.478
MATT: "I believe I spoke with you last, correct?"

562
00:22:55.711 --> 00:22:56.566
LAURA: Yes.

563
00:22:56.566 --> 00:22:57.789
MARISHA: Yeah.

564
00:22:57.789 --> 00:22:59.744
MATT: "From the spell? Sent words to me?"

565
00:22:59.744 --> 00:23:01.537
LAURA: Yes, yes, yes.

566
00:23:01.537 --> 00:23:03.787
MATT: "I apologize for the ruse."

567
00:23:04.683 --> 00:23:07.048
MARISHA: Yeah, what the hell?

568
00:23:07.048 --> 00:23:09.448
MATT: "I'm doing very specific secretive

569
00:23:09.448 --> 00:23:12.338
"work here and I was not to be followed.

570
00:23:12.338 --> 00:23:13.921
"Not supposed to be."

571
00:23:14.983 --> 00:23:16.691
LAURA: Lady Olios is looking for you.

572
00:23:16.691 --> 00:23:18.198
MARISHA: Yeah.

573
00:23:18.198 --> 00:23:19.867
LAURA: She's aware that you're here.

574
00:23:19.867 --> 00:23:21.174
Unless there's another spy from

575
00:23:21.174 --> 00:23:24.723
the Empire around, but I don't think so.

576
00:23:24.723 --> 00:23:27.247
MARISHA: She said to look for you at the Four Corners.

577
00:23:27.247 --> 00:23:29.730
As soon as I saw you looking through me,

578
00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:33.311
it felt really familiar, as you're doing right now.

579
00:23:33.311 --> 00:23:36.115
MATT: "Well, to be perfectly honest, you are

580
00:23:36.115 --> 00:23:38.438
"most likely the least likely person

581
00:23:38.438 --> 00:23:41.011
"I would have seen walk into that door.

582
00:23:41.011 --> 00:23:44.431
"Especially with this little bit of a disguise,"

583
00:23:44.431 --> 00:23:47.245
and she rubs some of the mud off your cheek.

584
00:23:47.245 --> 00:23:50.708
MARISHA: Yeah, well, you know, can't fucking help

585
00:23:50.708 --> 00:23:53.313
that I'm the only simple fucking human

586
00:23:53.313 --> 00:23:58.313
who can't change into shit here. Can you help with that?

587
00:23:58.767 --> 00:24:01.360
MATT: "Not now.

588
00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:02.990
"I have my own preparations."

589
00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:05.073
She touches a ring on her middle finger and goes,

590
00:24:05.073 --> 00:24:07.737
"I need this,

591
00:24:07.737 --> 00:24:12.737
"but get more prepared next time."

592
00:24:13.187 --> 00:24:14.697
At this point, Caleb, have you

593
00:24:14.697 --> 00:24:15.918
retrieved the rest of the party?

594
00:24:15.918 --> 00:24:17.434
LIAM: Yeah, I go to the bar

595
00:24:17.434 --> 00:24:18.891
and I wait in front of the building.

596
00:24:18.891 --> 00:24:20.644
MATT: You guys arrive at the same time and they're like--

597
00:24:20.644 --> 00:24:23.170
LIAM: Like no one would know anything was wrong.

598
00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:27.153
MARISHA: Speaking of bar: Thanks Alex and Tyler and Henry.

599
00:24:28.389 --> 00:24:32.420
MATT: But yeah, you guys are gathered by Caleb.

600
00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:34.337
LIAM: Where did you go? Where did you go? Where were you?

601
00:24:35.189 --> 00:24:37.713
SAM: Literally nowhere. We were in the back looking for you.

602
00:24:37.713 --> 00:24:38.689
LIAM: Come on, save it.

603
00:24:38.689 --> 00:24:39.749
SAM: I was waving everywhere.

604
00:24:39.749 --> 00:24:42.314
LIAM: Save it. We're going a couple blocks away.

605
00:24:42.314 --> 00:24:44.798
TRAVIS: Are you guys safe? Are we going into a fight?

606
00:24:44.798 --> 00:24:48.380
LIAM: No, it is someone that Beauregard knows from her past,

607
00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:51.355
I'm a little fuzzy on the details.

608
00:24:51.355 --> 00:24:52.471
It's like a broom closet, though,

609
00:24:52.471 --> 00:24:53.963
I don't know if we're going to fit.

610
00:24:53.963 --> 00:24:54.796
TRAVIS: Okay.

611
00:24:54.796 --> 00:24:55.917
LAURA: Does this count as a rest?

612
00:24:55.917 --> 00:24:56.750
MATT: No.

613
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:57.750
LAURA: Fuck.

614
00:24:59.339 --> 00:25:01.136
MARISHA: Oh yeah, we're super fucked up.

615
00:25:01.136 --> 00:25:02.683
TRAVIS: Can we keep an eye to see if anyone's

616
00:25:02.683 --> 00:25:05.088
watching us go towards this broom closet?

617
00:25:05.088 --> 00:25:07.574
MATT: Yes, you may. Make a perception check.

618
00:25:07.574 --> 00:25:09.157
TRAVIS: That's a "fid-ine."

619
00:25:11.645 --> 00:25:12.894
MATT: That's not a word.

620
00:25:12.894 --> 00:25:15.340
(laughter)

621
00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:16.182
TRAVIS: 15.

622
00:25:16.182 --> 00:25:19.739
MATT: 15! That is a word, actually, thank you very much.

623
00:25:19.739 --> 00:25:21.227
TALIESIN: 14.

624
00:25:21.227 --> 00:25:25.910
MATT: 14? Okay. You--

625
00:25:27.196 --> 00:25:31.192
Caduceus' color scheme draws a little bit of attention.

626
00:25:31.192 --> 00:25:32.590
TALIESIN: Yeah.

627
00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:34.669
TRAVIS: Those pastels, goddamn it.

628
00:25:34.669 --> 00:25:37.320
MATT: You're fine, Nott, you blend in well.

629
00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:38.625
You get the sense that people are

630
00:25:38.625 --> 00:25:40.340
noticing your presence, but you don't seem

631
00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:42.255
to be followed or drawing enough attention

632
00:25:42.255 --> 00:25:44.415
to where you're going to have to dodge anybody.

633
00:25:44.415 --> 00:25:45.759
If you wish to be more careful you could

634
00:25:45.759 --> 00:25:48.043
attempt to stealth your way towards

635
00:25:48.043 --> 00:25:49.919
this alley, that is your choice.

636
00:25:49.919 --> 00:25:51.021
LAUR:A I just cast Cure Wounds on you

637
00:25:51.021 --> 00:25:53.141
at 1st-level, so you got ten healing points.

638
00:25:53.141 --> 00:25:54.242
MARISHA: Thank you, Jester.

639
00:25:54.242 --> 00:25:56.116
LAURA: I cast it on myself, too, for 13 healing points.

640
00:25:56.116 --> 00:25:57.417
MATT: All right.

641
00:25:57.417 --> 00:25:58.272
TRAVIS: Caduceus.

642
00:25:58.272 --> 00:25:59.105
TALIESIN: Yeah?

643
00:25:59.105 --> 00:26:01.903
TRAVIS: Look a little grumpier.

644
00:26:01.903 --> 00:26:04.820
Yeah, now give me a real sour puss.

645
00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:09.605
Yeah, now chew on the back of your teeth.

646
00:26:09.605 --> 00:26:12.047
Let me see your jaw move. There you go.

647
00:26:12.047 --> 00:26:14.740
Now keep that face while we're walking, all right?

648
00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:16.575
LIAM: Also, bend your head down.

649
00:26:16.575 --> 00:26:18.529
Come to me, bend your head down.

650
00:26:18.529 --> 00:26:20.202
I pull a little bit of mud out of my pocket

651
00:26:20.202 --> 00:26:22.337
and I slap it down on top of his pink hair.

652
00:26:22.337 --> 00:26:25.719
TALIESIN: That's cold. That's really cold.

653
00:26:25.719 --> 00:26:27.386
LIAM: You're a mess. That's good, let's go.

654
00:26:28.344 --> 00:26:29.668
MATT: All right.

655
00:26:29.668 --> 00:26:31.708
At this point you guys, while this

656
00:26:31.708 --> 00:26:33.176
conversation's happening, you've managed

657
00:26:33.176 --> 00:26:35.094
to gather everyone over there.

658
00:26:35.094 --> 00:26:40.094
You guys see Dairon standing there, wearing dark leathers

659
00:26:41.371 --> 00:26:44.514
and cobbled elements of elven pieces to look

660
00:26:44.514 --> 00:26:47.791
as inconspicuous as possible in this space.

661
00:26:47.791 --> 00:26:52.791
You do see an elven woman, dark brown skin,

662
00:26:52.973 --> 00:26:56.837
piercing eyes, very short cut hair

663
00:26:56.837 --> 00:27:00.029
with a single earring piercing on this side.

664
00:27:01.582 --> 00:27:02.761
She has a scowling expression

665
00:27:02.761 --> 00:27:04.212
mid-conversation with your other

666
00:27:04.212 --> 00:27:06.185
compatriots before she looks around

667
00:27:06.185 --> 00:27:08.651
at the rest of you and goes,

668
00:27:08.651 --> 00:27:10.465
"I'm going to be honest, I'm very impressed you have

669
00:27:10.465 --> 00:27:12.431
"come this far without being noticed

670
00:27:12.431 --> 00:27:16.908
"with such a... cluster."

671
00:27:16.908 --> 00:27:20.408
TALIESIN: Did they tell you to make that face, too?

672
00:27:21.558 --> 00:27:23.891
MATT: "I don't like most of them."

673
00:27:24.858 --> 00:27:26.525
LAURA: I bet you like me.

674
00:27:29.261 --> 00:27:30.812
MATT: "I was--"

675
00:27:30.812 --> 00:27:33.011
(laughter)

676
00:27:33.011 --> 00:27:37.251
MATT: As you guys approach, Dairon,

677
00:27:37.251 --> 00:27:41.323
you quickly gather, is a very direct individual.

678
00:27:41.323 --> 00:27:44.766
Their time is measured and their attention

679
00:27:44.766 --> 00:27:47.352
is specifically focused towards Beauregard.

680
00:27:47.352 --> 00:27:48.736
She, you can see, is very much a,

681
00:27:48.736 --> 00:27:52.607
"You guys are here, but talking to you."

682
00:27:52.607 --> 00:27:55.503
"I am trying to figure out a connection

683
00:27:55.503 --> 00:27:58.336
"between the Kryn and the Assembly.

684
00:27:59.948 --> 00:28:04.013
"I've been following the local leadership as they travel,

00:28:04.013 --> 00:28:06.996
"seeking patterns and details of their plots, sending off

686
00:28:06.996 --> 00:28:10.663
"what I can back towards Bladegarden.

687
00:28:10.663 --> 00:28:12.702
"My next step is Ghor Dranas, if I can

00:28:12.702 --> 00:28:14.718
"make it as well.

689
00:28:14.718 --> 00:28:19.476
"I have a hunch that the Assembly may be aiding the Kryn

690
00:28:19.476 --> 00:28:21.457
"in some way."

691
00:28:21.457 --> 00:28:22.290
SAM: What?

692
00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:23.938
MATT: "I need to get closer to their

693
00:28:23.938 --> 00:28:26.017
"political center if I am to peel back

694
00:28:26.017 --> 00:28:27.483
"some of these inner layers of

"intrigue and confirm my suspicions.

"Weed out this traitor, whoever they may be,

"and see just how deep this rabbit hole goes.

"This dunamancy you speak of--"

706
00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:07.079
LAURA: It's super powerful.

707
00:29:07.079 --> 00:29:09.812
MATT: "And mostly not understood,

708
00:29:09.812 --> 00:29:12.458

"I don't know how long you intend to stay."

00:29:49.361 --> 00:29:51.274
LAURA: Neither do we.

721
00:29:51.274 --> 00:29:55.962
TALIESIN: We have the weird portal deal.

722
00:29:55.962 --> 00:29:57.715
MATT: "What is your name?"

723
00:29:57.715 --> 00:29:59.556
TALIESIN: Caduceus Clay, it's a pleasure-- oh.

724
00:29:59.556 --> 00:30:01.586
(grumpier) It's a pleasure to meet you.

725
00:30:01.586 --> 00:30:03.668
TRAVIS: Deucey, you can-- not in here.

726
00:30:03.668 --> 00:30:06.648
TALIESIN: Oh thank god, that was really hard, okay.

727
00:30:06.648 --> 00:30:08.648
MATT: "Right, the goblin one."

728
00:30:11.452 --> 00:30:13.086
SAM: Nott.

729
00:30:13.086 --> 00:30:15.897
MATT: "Nott. And you?"

730
00:30:15.897 --> 00:30:18.708
TRAVIS: I'm Fjord. Pleasure to make your acquaintance.

731
00:30:18.708 --> 00:30:22.213
MATT: "Right. Well."

732
00:30:22.213 --> 00:30:24.438
TALIESIN: You're the bird person.

733
00:30:25.329 --> 00:30:29.054
Oh, you're sending birds.

734
00:30:29.054 --> 00:30:30.128
You're the person who was sending birds.

735
00:30:30.128 --> 00:30:31.918
I think I figured out one of the things.

736
00:30:31.918 --> 00:30:32.751
TRAVIS: Bird?

737
00:30:32.751 --> 00:30:33.587
SAM: What birds?

738
00:30:33.587 --> 00:30:34.441
TALIESIN: Like--

739
00:30:34.441 --> 00:30:38.274
MATT: "That was indeed me, and now that I am aware that

740
00:30:38.274 --> 00:30:41.736

"gathering of information and returning myself."

743
00:30:46.552 --> 00:30:48.660
MARISHA: Yeah, Dairon, I don't think we should

744
00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:50.551
stay here anymore.

745
00:30:50.551 --> 00:30:53.559
They're onto you and your track, and if we don't

746
00:30:53.559 --> 00:30:56.330
come back with you, somebody else will.

747
00:30:56.330 --> 00:30:57.874
I think we need to--

748
00:30:57.874 --> 00:31:00.806
MATT: "Oh, I'm not traveling with you."

749
00:31:00.806 --> 00:31:01.745
MARISHA: "What?"

750
00:31:01.745 --> 00:31:05.462
MATT: "I operate alone. That's how I've survived this long.

751

TRAVIS: We've done pretty well for ourselves,

760
00:31:27.204 --> 00:31:30.426
and if I may, I think it might be wise

761
00:31:30.426 --> 00:31:34.341
to perhaps throw her holiness off your scent

762
00:31:34.341 --> 00:31:37.072
by maybe framing someone else as this

763
00:31:37.072 --> 00:31:40.744
traitor if she's indeed looking for you.

764
00:31:40.744 --> 00:31:44.744
Might be worth a little extra effort in the day.

765
00:31:45.782 --> 00:31:48.208
MATT: "If you were able to pull off such a deceit, then that

766

767

the spy, you know, and we just

773
00:32:07.289 --> 00:32:08.796
looked for those portals and stuff?

774
00:32:08.796 --> 00:32:09.772
SAM: Seems safer.

775
00:32:09.772 --> 00:32:12.355
TALIESIN: Or there's a middle way here.

776
00:32:13.319 --> 00:32:17.155
We give your bird friend enough time to leave town,

777
00:32:17.155 --> 00:32:19.113
and then we simply lead them to whatever's

778
00:32:19.113 --> 00:32:22.825
left of the operation once you've skedaddled.

779

Prove that the operation's over and that we've

780
00:32:24.496 --> 00:32:29.496
found the mechanisms by which it was operating.

781
00:32:30.002 --> 00:32:31.305
TRAVIS: Yeah, orchestrated.

782
00:32:31.305 --> 00:32:32.571
TALIESIN: Orchestrated.

783

SAM: Do you have some sort of headquarters

784
00:32:33.792 --> 00:32:35.749
with a pile of birds somewhere?

785
00:32:35.749 --> 00:32:37.339
LAURA: A bunch of notes scribbled and

786
00:32:37.339 --> 00:32:39.498
stuff that don't mean anything?

787
00:32:39.498 --> 00:32:41.497
MARISHA: This is Dairon.

788
00:32:41.497 --> 00:32:46.497
She's a monk of the Cobalt Soul. She's my mentor.

789
00:32:46.629 --> 00:32:48.212
She's an Expositor.

790
00:32:50.171 --> 00:32:53.147
TRAVIS: Oh. Yeah, I think you mentioned her before.

791
00:32:53.147 --> 00:32:53.980
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Yeah.

I apologize, you say in the midst of this

war between the Empire and the Kryn Dynasty,

798
00:33:18.559 --> 00:33:21.455
you feel that there are people from the

799
00:33:21.455 --> 00:33:26.455
Cerberus Assembly who are in league with someone?

800
00:33:26.468 --> 00:33:28.057

One more question on a more personal level,

you said you're headed towards Ghor Dranas?

political prisoner being held,

871
00:36:44.217 --> 00:36:46.941

00:37:04.026 --> 00:37:05.697
actually maybe do a little digging

881

00:37:07.368 --> 00:37:08.960
I mean we know what direction you're going to be.

883
00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:10.098
LAURA: That would be great.

884
00:37:10.098 --> 00:37:12.542
Just tell us what it looks like and where to enter.

885
00:37:12.542 --> 00:37:14.418
TALIESIN: Or if you've heard anything about

886
00:37:14.418 --> 00:37:15.969
the person that we're looking for.

887
00:37:15.969 --> 00:37:19.226
LAURA: Like where soldiers are less concentrated and stuff

888
00:37:19.226 --> 00:37:21.877
so we could get in and stuff, that'd be great.

889
00:37:21.877 --> 00:37:25.301
TALIESIN: Obviously you'd still be alone, a lone wolf.

890
00:37:25.301 --> 00:37:27.258
SAM: We're constantly talking to you--

891
00:37:27.258 --> 00:37:29.091
MARISHA: Everyone shut up for a minute.

892
00:37:29.091 --> 00:37:30.691
MATT: Dairon turns to you and goes,

893
00:37:30.691 --> 00:37:31.941
"Do you trust these people?

894
00:37:31.941 --> 00:37:34.797
"Do your instincts tell you that they can be trusted?"

895
00:37:34.797 --> 00:37:36.386
TRAVIS: All right, close talk, let's everybody

896
00:37:36.386 --> 00:37:38.259
step out and give them a minute, just a second.

897
00:37:38.259 --> 00:37:40.094
MARISHA: Thank you, Fjord.

898
00:37:40.094 --> 00:37:41.764
LAURA: Yes, everyone leave okay?

899
00:37:41.764 --> 00:37:43.476
It's just us girls and--

900
00:37:43.476 --> 00:37:45.559
TRAVIS: Jester, would you mind?

901
00:37:51.102 --> 00:37:56.102
MARISHA: Yeah, kind of. Look, that's beyond the point.

902
00:37:56.484 --> 00:37:58.726
I have a lot of good information, a lot of things

903
00:37:58.726 --> 00:38:01.580
that I can inform you of, but you keep

904
00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:06.273
writing me off pretty fucking easily right now.

905
00:38:06.273 --> 00:38:10.432
MATT: "I'm not writing you off, I'm writing them off.

906
00:38:10.432 --> 00:38:13.613
"We have to be careful what information is disseminated."

907
00:38:13.613 --> 00:38:14.791
MARISHA: What was I supposed to do?

908
00:38:14.791 --> 00:38:18.260
Just go out alone and just piss into the wind?

909
00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:19.093
MATT: "No.

910
00:38:20.093 --> 00:38:21.437
"I mean..."

911
00:38:21.437 --> 00:38:22.905
MARISHA: How was I supposed to get better?

912
00:38:22.905 --> 00:38:24.322
You fucking left!

913
00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:31.302
You told me you were going to Bladegarden for a month.

914
00:38:31.302 --> 00:38:33.256
MATT: "That was to prevent you from being

915
00:38:33.256 --> 00:38:36.006
"foolish enough to follow me east.

916
00:38:37.087 --> 00:38:38.675
"But that happened anyway."

917
00:38:38.675 --> 00:38:40.713
MARISHA: And not because of you.

918
00:38:40.713 --> 00:38:43.554
MATT: "Well, regardless, I'm just

919
00:38:43.554 --> 00:38:46.712
concerned for your well-being."

920
00:38:46.712 --> 00:38:49.516
MARISHA: And I'm concerned for yours.

921
00:38:49.516 --> 00:38:50.349
MATT: "Good."

922
00:38:51.266 --> 00:38:52.864
MARISHA: We can do great if maybe we

923
00:38:52.864 --> 00:38:55.147
team up a little bit, you know?

924
00:38:55.147 --> 00:38:57.145
MATT: "And maybe we can.

925
00:38:57.145 --> 00:38:59.754
"If you trust these people, and I know you,

926
00:38:59.754 --> 00:39:01.795
"even the time we've had just a brief bit,

927
00:39:01.795 --> 00:39:04.445
"to be a very insightful individual.

928
00:39:04.445 --> 00:39:09.175
"If you trust them, then I trust you.

929
00:39:09.175 --> 00:39:13.491
"But I specialize

930
00:39:13.491 --> 00:39:16.116
"in moving unseen alone.

931
00:39:16.116 --> 00:39:18.836
"If you can survive moving to Ghor Dranas

932
00:39:18.836 --> 00:39:23.034
"as you intend to go, then reach out to me.

933
00:39:23.034 --> 00:39:25.278
"We can reconvene there.

934
00:39:25.278 --> 00:39:27.925
"But you have to find your own way and I will find mine."

935
00:39:27.925 --> 00:39:28.925
MARISHA: All right.

936
00:39:31.307 --> 00:39:33.140
MATT: "Inform your friends."

937
00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:37.307
MARISHA: They're doing experiments on people.

938
00:39:38.142 --> 00:39:40.181
The Cerberus Assembly.

939
00:39:40.181 --> 00:39:42.514
MATT: "This does not surprise me."

940
00:39:43.811 --> 00:39:47.086
MARISHA: Weird crystals and magic.

941
00:39:47.967 --> 00:39:50.134
Trying to enhance their...

942
00:39:51.344 --> 00:39:53.927
Beings, I don't know, whatever.

943
00:39:55.667 --> 00:39:57.298
MATT: "The biggest mistake the bloodline

944
00:39:57.298 --> 00:39:58.968
"ever made was letting them have

945
00:39:58.968 --> 00:40:02.635
"any sort of seat of power in the government.

946
00:40:04.388 --> 00:40:05.812
"Well."

947
00:40:05.812 --> 00:40:08.746
MARISHA: Where do you stand with the Kryn on this?

948
00:40:08.746 --> 00:40:10.459
MATT: "Stand with the Kryn?"

949
00:40:10.459 --> 00:40:14.868
MARISHA: Are they-- I don't know.

950
00:40:14.868 --> 00:40:17.478
Do you have any idea of their motivation?

951
00:40:17.478 --> 00:40:21.393
MATT: "I don't trust any political figure.

952
00:40:21.393 --> 00:40:22.940
"If you had been paying attention

953
00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:24.447
"in your historical studies, you know

954
00:40:24.447 --> 00:40:26.697
"the drow cannot be trusted."

955
00:40:28.441 --> 00:40:31.092
MARISHA: That seems like a generalization considering--

956
00:40:31.092 --> 00:40:33.863
MATT: "I've lost people important to me."

957
00:40:33.863 --> 00:40:36.675
MARISHA: So even more reason for biasness.

958
00:40:36.675 --> 00:40:39.842
I would think you-- you taught me that!

959
00:40:42.547 --> 00:40:45.724
MATT: "I appreciate your interest in my wellbeing,

960
00:40:45.724 --> 00:40:48.825
"but you are young, you are unfocused,

961
00:40:48.825 --> 00:40:51.075
"and you have much to learn.

962
00:40:52.569 --> 00:40:57.569
"Now I see great possibility in you, you have potential.

963
00:40:58.276 --> 00:41:00.785
"But you need to listen.

964
00:41:02.394 --> 00:41:04.477
"And think before you act.

965
00:41:07.824 --> 00:41:11.991
"Your rash, intense behavior will be your downfall.

966
00:41:12.956 --> 00:41:15.623
"And then you'll achieve nothing.

967
00:41:17.405 --> 00:41:19.398
"You've grown, I can see it.

968
00:41:19.398 --> 00:41:20.864
"I'm very impressed by what you

969
00:41:20.864 --> 00:41:23.961
"displayed there in the gravel pit."

970
00:41:23.961 --> 00:41:27.708
MARISHA: I've had good conversations too, just fucking

971
00:41:27.708 --> 00:41:31.415
no one's been there to fucking see it.

972
00:41:31.415 --> 00:41:34.025
MATT: "That means you're doing it well.

973
00:41:34.025 --> 00:41:36.918
"No one has to see what you're doing if it's good.

974
00:41:36.918 --> 00:41:39.323
"As long as it's doing good.

975
00:41:39.323 --> 00:41:42.471
"Do you think anyone cares about the things I've done?

976
00:41:42.471 --> 00:41:44.182
"I've done many things, not many I'm

977
00:41:44.182 --> 00:41:47.523
"proud of, but they have served

978
00:41:49.799 --> 00:41:52.023
the goodness of others.

979
00:41:52.023 --> 00:41:54.978
"They have enabled many people who could not defend

980
00:41:54.978 --> 00:41:58.978
"themselves in the Empire to survive and improve.

981
00:41:59.832 --> 00:42:02.564
"I do not do this for accolades.

982
00:42:02.564 --> 00:42:06.155
"I do this because I serve a purpose

983
00:42:06.155 --> 00:42:10.973
"of a better world for those who cannot defend themselves.

984
00:42:10.973 --> 00:42:13.223
"Can you serve that purpose?"

985
00:42:18.589 --> 00:42:20.289
MARISHA: I can try.

986
00:42:20.289 --> 00:42:22.380
MATT: "Then do not wait for them to see

987
00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:23.219
"what you do that is good.

988
00:42:23.219 --> 00:42:25.136
"Just know that you've done good,

"and hope you live long enough to see the impact it has."

990
00:42:31.819 --> 00:42:33.247
MARISHA: Could be dead tomorrow.

991
00:42:33.247 --> 00:42:36.473
MATT: "You could, but you're not yet."

992
00:42:38.535 --> 00:42:40.123
MARISHA: Not yet.

993
00:42:40.123 --> 00:42:42.404
MATT: "So listen.

994
00:42:42.404 --> 00:42:44.727
"Be patient.

"but don't get too close."

997
00:42:52.162 --> 00:42:54.270
MARISHA: I haven't.

998
00:42:56.243 --> 00:43:00.832
MATT: "Good. Now I need to go and

999
00:43:00.832 --> 00:43:04.782
"collect my things,

my materials for travel."

1002
00:43:10.351 --> 00:43:12.518
MARISHA: Did you name your birds?

1003
00:43:13.695 --> 00:43:16.691
MATT: "No. Do not get too close."

1004
00:43:16.691 --> 00:43:20.588
(laughter)

1005
00:43:22.541 --> 00:43:24.748
MARISHA: You should have Jester name your birds--

1006
00:43:24.748 --> 00:43:28.540
MATT: "I named a bird once and it never came back,

1007
00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:30.701
"so I do not name my birds."

1008
00:43:30.701 --> 00:43:33.637
MARISHA: She has a ferret named Sprinkle that has

1009
00:43:33.637 --> 00:43:37.137
survived against all fucking odds, Dairon.

1010
00:43:38.119 --> 00:43:41.086
I'm just saying maybe...

1011
00:43:41.955 --> 00:43:44.929
You can mix it up or something, maybe.

1012
00:43:44.929 --> 00:43:48.596
LAURA: I knock on the door and say: It's a weasel!

1013
00:43:51.914 --> 00:43:53.136
MARISHA: Weasel.

1014
00:43:53.136 --> 00:43:54.643
MATT: "I appreciate your concern, I will say

1015

"that weasels are not known for their ability

"to travel long distances with messages safely."

1017
00:43:59.531 --> 00:44:00.748
MARISHA: No, but they can hold their breath

1018
00:44:00.748 --> 00:44:03.847
for a real long fucking time, apparently.

1019
00:44:03.847 --> 00:44:04.908
MATT: "Noted."

1020
00:44:04.908 --> 00:44:06.415

"to the archives of the Cobalt Soul."

1023

LIAM: Monk talk.

MATT: "Nevertheless, before I leave, I think

1025
00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:18.426

I'll find you.

MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1037
00:44:41.539 --> 00:44:44.013
MATT: She grabs the ring and twists it a bit

1038
00:44:44.013 --> 00:44:47.575
and her form turns back into that of a dark elf.

1039
00:44:47.575 --> 00:44:48.408
TRAVIS: Dope!

1040
00:44:48.408 --> 00:44:50.876
MARISHA: I want that.

1041
00:44:50.876 --> 00:44:52.708
MATT: Walks past you and takes a moment,

1042
00:44:52.708 --> 00:44:55.287
put her hand on your shoulder and says,

1043
00:44:55.287 --> 00:44:58.386
"Please live,"

1044
00:44:59.402 --> 00:45:00.910
and walks past and walks through

1045
00:45:00.910 --> 00:45:02.661
the door to the rest of you.

1046
00:45:02.661 --> 00:45:06.161
"Thank you for your patience, and good luck."

1047
00:45:07.059 --> 00:45:08.201
LAURA: You too.

1048
00:45:08.201 --> 00:45:09.379
MATT: She turns around and just leaves down

1049
00:45:09.379 --> 00:45:13.046
the alleyway and vanishes around the corner.

1050
00:45:15.902 --> 00:45:16.819
SAM: Intrigue.

1051
00:45:17.738 --> 00:45:20.552
TRAVIS:a That end on good terms?

1052
00:45:20.552 --> 00:45:23.123
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm going to meet up with her later.

1053
00:45:23.123 --> 00:45:24.222
TRAVIS: To?

1054
00:45:24.222 --> 00:45:25.526
MARISHA: Train.

1055
00:45:25.526 --> 00:45:26.359
TRAVIS: Ah.

1056
00:45:27.274 --> 00:45:28.662
LIAM: This evening?

1057
00:45:28.662 --> 00:45:30.253
Are we still leaving tomorrow?

1058
00:45:30.253 --> 00:45:31.670
Is that the plan?

1059
00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:34.900
LAURA: I guess it depends on if you guys

1060
00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:37.677
want to search for, you know...

1061
00:45:37.677 --> 00:45:38.859
TRAVIS:a The rifts?

1062
00:45:38.859 --> 00:45:41.879
LAURA: Yeah, portals into a whole other dimension and stuff.

1063
00:45:41.879 --> 00:45:44.195
SAM: What time is it?

1064
00:45:44.195 --> 00:45:45.865
MATT: At this point in the day, I'd say it's

1065
00:45:45.865 --> 00:45:48.313
maybe 2 o'clock in the afternoon.

1066
00:45:48.313 --> 00:45:51.852
SAM: We can at least spend the
rest of the day snooping around

1067
00:45:51.852 --> 00:45:52.685
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1068
00:45:52.685 --> 00:45:54.033
TALIESIN: Right.

1069
00:45:54.033 --> 00:45:56.194
TALIESIN: I thought that favor would be worth something.

1070
00:45:56.194 --> 00:45:57.415
SAM: I agree.

1071
00:45:57.415 --> 00:46:02.263
LAURA: My spells got depleted in that fisticuffs.

1072
00:46:02.263 --> 00:46:03.524
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm pretty tired still.

1073
00:46:03.524 --> 00:46:04.745
LAURA: I won't be very good at healing

1074
00:46:04.745 --> 00:46:06.132
you guys if anything happens.

1075
00:46:06.132 --> 00:46:07.522
TALIESIN: Well, if we find something,

1076
00:46:07.522 --> 00:46:09.520
then we can save it for tomorrow.

1077
00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:11.434
LAURA: Yeah, we always do that.

1078
00:46:11.434 --> 00:46:13.898
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yeah.

1079
00:46:13.898 --> 00:46:16.290
Do you need a short or a long?

1080
00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:17.627
LAURA: I would need a long rest.

1081
00:46:17.627 --> 00:46:18.460
LIAM: Go eat.

1082
00:46:19.338 --> 00:46:21.863
At the inn and not have a fist fight.

1083
00:46:21.863 --> 00:46:22.841
And take it easy.

1084
00:46:22.841 --> 00:46:23.731
TRAVIS: Let's do that.

1085
00:46:23.731 --> 00:46:25.154
MARISHA: A short rest would be nice.

1086
00:46:25.154 --> 00:46:27.517
TRAVIS: Let's get some food and take a long rest.

1087
00:46:27.517 --> 00:46:28.451
SAM: A long rest?

1088
00:46:28.451 --> 00:46:29.304
LAURA: A short rest.

1089
00:46:29.304 --> 00:46:30.770
TRAVIS: I meant a short rest.

1090
00:46:30.770 --> 00:46:31.957
TALIESIN: A long short rest.

1091
00:46:31.957 --> 00:46:32.790
TRAVIS: Yep.

1092
00:46:33.930 --> 00:46:37.970
LIAM: As short rests go on the longer side.

1093
00:46:37.970 --> 00:46:39.436
SAM: Caleb, before we go.

1094
00:46:39.436 --> 00:46:40.695
LAURA: What the fuck did you mean?

1095
00:46:40.695 --> 00:46:42.119
SAM: Were you just BSing?

1096
00:46:42.119 --> 00:46:44.314
Is this your real accent?

1097
00:46:44.314 --> 00:46:45.743
LIAM: This is my real accent.

1098
00:46:45.743 --> 00:46:46.882
SAM: So you were lying.

1099
00:46:46.882 --> 00:46:48.025
LIAM: I was lying.

1100
00:46:48.025 --> 00:46:48.858
SAM: So clever.

1101
00:46:48.858 --> 00:46:50.389
LAURA: You should seriously listen to her then

1102
00:46:50.389 --> 00:46:52.673
because that is a really noticeable accent.

1103
00:46:52.673 --> 00:46:53.978
SAM: Can you try a different accent?

1104
00:46:53.978 --> 00:46:55.570
LIAM: I am terrible at accents.

1105
00:46:55.570 --> 00:46:58.989
SAM: Try one. Try to sound like me.

1106
00:46:58.989 --> 00:47:00.166
Sound like me.

1107
00:47:00.166 --> 00:47:02.576
LIAM: (awkwardly) Try to sound like you.

1108
00:47:02.576 --> 00:47:03.634
SAM: Wow!

1109
00:47:03.634 --> 00:47:07.759
LIAM: I am a little goblin, and I like buttons.

1110
00:47:07.759 --> 00:47:09.094
SAM: Do an easier one.

1111
00:47:09.094 --> 00:47:10.316
TRAVIS: Do Jester, yeah, do Jester.

1112
00:47:10.316 --> 00:47:13.245
LAURA: Do me, I'm closer to your accent, yeah yeah yeah.

1113
00:47:13.245 --> 00:47:14.345
LIAM: (bad Jester accent) Oh, hi.

1114
00:47:14.345 --> 00:47:15.277
LAURA: Yes!

1115
00:47:15.277 --> 00:47:20.277
LIAM: I am loving pastries, and also my god is--

1116
00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:22.816
What?

1117
00:47:22.816 --> 00:47:27.780
My god is so cool, you guys.

1118
00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:28.757
LAURA: That's really good.

1119
00:47:28.757 --> 00:47:31.116
SAM: What if you did a little Fjord?

1120
00:47:31.116 --> 00:47:32.532
LIAM: (pronounced German accent) Eldritch blast.

1121
00:47:32.532 --> 00:47:35.079
SAM: Nope!

1122
00:47:35.079 --> 00:47:38.459
I think you put extra consonants that aren't even there!

1123
00:47:38.459 --> 00:47:43.234
LIAM: Eld-rich, Eld-ridge blast.

1124
00:47:43.234 --> 00:47:47.509
SAM: "Blaest?!" There are no Es in that word.

1125
00:47:47.509 --> 00:47:50.241
TRAVIS: I hope I don't sound like that.

1126
00:47:50.241 --> 00:47:52.888
That is a ding to the ol' self-confidence.

1127
00:47:52.888 --> 00:47:55.862
LIAM: I like to swallow swords.

1128
00:47:55.862 --> 00:47:58.059
TRAVIS: Nope, I never said that.

1129
00:47:58.059 --> 00:48:02.184
That's not what I-- I don't say that ever.

1130
00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:06.577
You know, maybe it's just better you stick with what works.

1131
00:48:06.577 --> 00:48:09.430
LIAM: I, Liam, who am very good at accents

1132
00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:12.409
am finding it so hard to be Zemnian

1133
00:48:12.409 --> 00:48:15.302
and really bad at accents.

1134
00:48:15.302 --> 00:48:16.441
TALIESIN: It's so good though.

1135
00:48:16.441 --> 00:48:19.501
LAURA: Just don't talk. Just don't talk maybe.

1136
00:48:19.501 --> 00:48:21.905
In places where people can hear you and stuff.

1137
00:48:21.905 --> 00:48:23.631
LIAM: (bad Caduceus accent) That's nice.

1138
00:48:23.631 --> 00:48:25.995
TRAVIS: Okay, wow.

1139
00:48:25.995 --> 00:48:27.418
LAURA: That sounded a lot like, honestly

1140
00:48:27.418 --> 00:48:28.763
that sounded a lot like--

1141
00:48:28.763 --> 00:48:30.521
SAM: Say technically, say technically.

1142
00:48:30.521 --> 00:48:31.537
LAURA: Technically.

1143
00:48:31.537 --> 00:48:34.837
LIAM: Tek-a-nick-ly. Technically.

1144
00:48:34.837 --> 00:48:38.098
TALIESIN: This counts as a long rest right now, I feel like.

1145
00:48:38.098 --> 00:48:39.810
MATT: By the end of this conversation, probably.

1146
00:48:39.810 --> 00:48:40.747
TALIESIN: Thank you.

1147
00:48:40.747 --> 00:48:42.907
TRAVIS: I bet we can grab a meal, and then, I mean

1148
00:48:42.907 --> 00:48:44.780
where else are we going to look for these rifts?

1149
00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:46.042
I mean the only other thing I can think of

1150
00:48:46.042 --> 00:48:47.591
is maybe checking where the guy who

1151
00:48:47.591 --> 00:48:49.058
murdered his wife, where did he work

1152
00:48:49.058 --> 00:48:51.831
every day, was there somewhere he frequented?

1153
00:48:51.831 --> 00:48:52.974
TRAVIS: That's a good idea.

1154
00:48:52.974 --> 00:48:54.725
SAM: We also have one other lead, maybe?

1155
00:48:54.725 --> 00:48:57.246
Someone mentioned, was it the

1156
00:48:57.246 --> 00:49:01.151
bunch of kobolds in a bag or whatever?

1157
00:49:01.151 --> 00:49:01.984
Who said--

1158
00:49:01.984 --> 00:49:03.533
TRAVIS: They needed materials, right?

1159
00:49:03.533 --> 00:49:07.244
SAM: From a very strange, the tumor moss plant

1160
00:49:07.244 --> 00:49:11.035
in this grove near the thing that was uncorrupted.

1161
00:49:11.035 --> 00:49:13.073
Maybe it's uncorrupted because it's the source

1162
00:49:13.073 --> 00:49:14.579
of the rifts or something like that.

1163
00:49:14.579 --> 00:49:15.412
TALIESIN: Tuba moss.

1164
00:49:15.412 --> 00:49:16.382
Tuber moss.

1165
00:49:16.382 --> 00:49:18.062
LAURA: Tuber moss?

1166
00:49:18.062 --> 00:49:19.295
SAM: I thought it was tumor moss.

1167
00:49:19.295 --> 00:49:21.509
MATT, TALIESIN, SAM, and LAURA: Tumor moss.

1168
00:49:21.509 --> 00:49:23.545
TALIESIN: Is it moss that grows on a tumor?

1169
00:49:23.545 --> 00:49:24.398
MARISHA: Or is it--

1170
00:49:24.398 --> 00:49:25.987
TALIESIN: I thought it would be a tuber.

1171
00:49:25.987 --> 00:49:28.517
LAURA: Or is it moss that grows really fast?

1172
00:49:28.517 --> 00:49:30.634
Because don't tumors do that?

1173
00:49:30.634 --> 00:49:31.735
TALIESIN: I've legitimately been thinking

1174
00:49:31.735 --> 00:49:33.002
about a tuber this entire time.

1175
00:49:33.002 --> 00:49:34.915
TRAVIS: If we're actually searching for a plant

1176
00:49:34.915 --> 00:49:36.303
and then just trying to figure out

1177
00:49:36.303 --> 00:49:37.443
where a guy worked, that doesn't

1178
00:49:37.443 --> 00:49:38.909
seem super dangerous, it seems like

1179
00:49:38.909 --> 00:49:41.883
we can divide and conquer, yeah?

1180
00:49:41.883 --> 00:49:43.597
LAURA: I don't think we should divide anything.

1181
00:49:43.597 --> 00:49:44.860
SAM: Well, let's go ask around at maybe

1182
00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:47.022
the pub nearest to his house.

1183
00:49:47.022 --> 00:49:49.695
Maybe he went there to eat dinner.

1184
00:49:49.695 --> 00:49:53.620
MARISHA: Also maybe to Dairon's point, all of us

1185
00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:57.083
roaming together might be a little suspicious

1186
00:49:57.083 --> 00:50:00.714
in these daytime hours, I don't know.

1187
00:50:00.714 --> 00:50:02.384
LAURA: Then we should separate Nott and Caleb

1188
00:50:02.384 --> 00:50:05.157
so we can keep our messages with each other.

1189
00:50:05.157 --> 00:50:07.892
TRAVIS: Yeah, but maybe we can just give ourselves distance.

1190
00:50:07.892 --> 00:50:10.089
Like 50 feet in-between.

1191
00:50:10.089 --> 00:50:11.720
You enter the pub first, we come in

1192
00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:13.026
a little later, sit at different

1193
00:50:13.026 --> 00:50:15.025
tables, keep an eye on each other.

1194
00:50:15.025 --> 00:50:16.127
MARISHA: That's a good point.

1195
00:50:16.127 --> 00:50:17.107
We could probably do that.

1196
00:50:17.107 --> 00:50:19.190
TRAVIS: Yep. If one of us goes out the back door,

1197
00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:22.894
we fucking plan ahead of time where we're meeting.

1198
00:50:22.894 --> 00:50:23.727
MARISHA: I thought you were going to

1199
00:50:23.727 --> 00:50:25.302
come right around the front, man.

1200
00:50:25.302 --> 00:50:27.139
TRAVIS: That's where we-- I did, we turned

1201
00:50:27.139 --> 00:50:29.096
the corner, no one to be seen.

1202
00:50:29.096 --> 00:50:30.441
You're fucking gone, what do we--

1203
00:50:30.441 --> 00:50:31.828
MARISHA: Sorry, she was moving fast.

1204
00:50:31.828 --> 00:50:33.336
I didn't want to lose her.

1205
00:50:33.336 --> 00:50:35.819
You know what, probably my fault in hindsight, sorry.

1206
00:50:35.819 --> 00:50:38.195
LAURA: No it wasn't, Beau.

1207
00:50:38.195 --> 00:50:39.826
SAM: The front door of the bar's our designated

1208
00:50:39.826 --> 00:50:42.315
meeting place if we get split up, all right?

1209
00:50:42.315 --> 00:50:45.050
Front of the Four Corners.

1210
00:50:45.050 --> 00:50:49.199
If we ask around, are we in the area

1211
00:50:49.199 --> 00:50:52.182
where the crazy man who killed his family--

1212
00:50:52.182 --> 00:50:53.117
LAURA: Old Potis.

1213
00:50:53.117 --> 00:50:54.545
MATT: Make an investigation check if you

1214
00:50:54.545 --> 00:50:56.377
want to spend the next period of time

1215
00:50:56.377 --> 00:50:59.882
asking around and inquiring about it.

1216
00:50:59.882 --> 00:51:00.940
SAM: Big money, big money.

1217
00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:02.489
TALIESIN: We're going to be asking in the bar while we--

1218
00:51:02.489 --> 00:51:03.386
SAM: 24.

1219
00:51:03.386 --> 00:51:04.303
MATT: 24, nice.

1220
00:51:05.173 --> 00:51:08.173
All right, so a few things, actually.

1221
00:51:10.312 --> 00:51:13.287
In asking around some of the strange individuals

1222
00:51:13.287 --> 00:51:16.302
that make their space and time here

1223
00:51:16.302 --> 00:51:18.095
in this rowdy Four Corners tavern,

1224
00:51:18.095 --> 00:51:20.747
you hear the sound of fisticuffs

1225
00:51:20.747 --> 00:51:23.231
and angry grunts as a new bout

1226
00:51:23.231 --> 00:51:24.983
of four contenders are throwing

1227
00:51:24.983 --> 00:51:26.083
their ante into the ring and are

1228
00:51:26.083 --> 00:51:27.836
beating the shit out of each other.

1229
00:51:27.836 --> 00:51:29.506
You hear someone scream out as they're shanked

1230
00:51:29.506 --> 00:51:31.586
and everyone goes, "Oh!" in the background,

1231
00:51:31.586 --> 00:51:33.624
there's a blood splatter in the gravel

1232
00:51:33.624 --> 00:51:35.543
and you wait for the fight to finish,

1233
00:51:35.543 --> 00:51:37.257
and then one of them appears to be bleeding out,

1234
00:51:37.257 --> 00:51:38.842
they drag him outside, then somebody goes

1235
00:51:38.842 --> 00:51:40.555
and turns the gravel over like a cat box,

1236
00:51:40.555 --> 00:51:42.185
just prevent it from being seen.

1237
00:51:42.185 --> 00:51:43.369
TALIESIN: I keep hitting Spare the Dying

1238
00:51:43.369 --> 00:51:45.696
on everybody who drops quietly in the back.

1239
00:51:45.696 --> 00:51:47.000
MATT: Oh you're really sweet, Caduceus.

1240
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:48.183
TALIESIN: It's a bonus action, man.

1241
00:51:48.183 --> 00:51:49.683
MATT: Yeah, go for it.

1242
00:51:50.647 --> 00:51:55.642
You hear one kind of...

1243
00:51:55.642 --> 00:51:58.395
Intense-looking gnoll.

1244
00:51:58.395 --> 00:51:59.905
Huge scarred face, one eye is just

1245
00:51:59.905 --> 00:52:03.574
ruined and healed over and unusable.

1246
00:52:03.574 --> 00:52:05.824
Begins talking about how--

1247
00:52:06.996 --> 00:52:09.929
"I've been hearing about strange dreams.

1248
00:52:09.929 --> 00:52:11.151
"People keep saying they hear

1249
00:52:11.151 --> 00:52:13.887
"creepy sounds and howls at night

1250
00:52:13.887 --> 00:52:16.947
"near the northern center of town."

1251
00:52:16.947 --> 00:52:18.619
SAM: Northern center of town?

1252
00:52:18.619 --> 00:52:20.495
MATT: "Yeah, spooking folks, it's been strange.

1253
00:52:20.495 --> 00:52:21.802
"I haven't been there, but a few guys

1254
00:52:21.802 --> 00:52:23.392
"I know in the region haven't been

1255
00:52:23.392 --> 00:52:24.611
"sleeping well, hearing these noises,

1256
00:52:24.611 --> 00:52:25.837
"waking up in the middle of the night."

1257
00:52:25.837 --> 00:52:27.794
SAM: Is that area of town called anything,

1258
00:52:27.794 --> 00:52:29.668
or is it just northern center?

1259
00:52:29.668 --> 00:52:31.092
MATT: "It's the northern center."

1260
00:52:31.092 --> 00:52:31.948
SAM: All right.

1261
00:52:31.948 --> 00:52:33.945
Is there a pub or tavern

1262
00:52:33.945 --> 00:52:36.562
near there that we could--(stammering)

1263
00:52:36.562 --> 00:52:37.686
MARISHA: He just gave up.

1264
00:52:37.686 --> 00:52:41.821
MATT: "No, only just people finding places to live."

1265
00:52:43.517 --> 00:52:45.928
SAM: No, just around there.

1266
00:52:45.928 --> 00:52:47.066
All right.

1267
00:52:47.066 --> 00:52:52.066
Know anything about a grove near the

1268
00:52:52.249 --> 00:52:54.784
Ifolon River?

1269
00:52:54.784 --> 00:52:56.613
LAURA: I think that's outside of town.

1270
00:52:56.613 --> 00:52:58.037
MATT: "No, haven't heard of it."

1271
00:52:58.037 --> 00:53:00.033
(snarls)

1272
00:53:00.033 --> 00:53:01.450
Leaves the space.

1273
00:53:02.442 --> 00:53:04.925
Eventually you come around to another goblin

1274
00:53:04.925 --> 00:53:09.334
who's sitting there, one of the workers of the bugbear

1275
00:53:09.334 --> 00:53:11.403
that runs the Four Corners, who's in

1276
00:53:11.403 --> 00:53:15.070
the process of washing the glasses poorly.

1277
00:53:15.070 --> 00:53:16.618
Younger goblin you see with these

1278
00:53:16.618 --> 00:53:18.935
bright vibrant yellow eyes that never

1279
00:53:18.935 --> 00:53:21.056
seem to blink, lidless almost.

1280
00:53:21.056 --> 00:53:24.606
Big wide flapping ears, and a jaw that seems

1281
00:53:24.606 --> 00:53:26.762
to be protruding and hooking up to the point

1282
00:53:26.762 --> 00:53:29.595
where he has this heavy underbite.

1283
00:53:30.635 --> 00:53:32.791
He overhears the conversation and goes,

1284
00:53:32.791 --> 00:53:37.157
"Are you here about the-- the screaming?

1285
00:53:37.157 --> 00:53:38.868
The howls?

1286
00:53:38.868 --> 00:53:40.254
SAM: The what?

1287
00:53:40.254 --> 00:53:41.800
MATT: "People been saying they've been

1288
00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:44.652
"seeing eyes in the shadows."

1289
00:53:44.652 --> 00:53:46.649
LAURA: Those are the creatures that come out--

1290
00:53:46.649 --> 00:53:50.424
SAM: Where have you heard this, fellow goblin friend?

1291
00:53:51.349 --> 00:53:52.471
MATT: "Yeah."

1292
00:53:52.471 --> 00:53:54.772
SAM: Where has this been?

1293
00:53:54.772 --> 00:53:56.444
MATT: "People saying it's that part

1294
00:53:56.444 --> 00:53:59.378
"of the neighborhood around the well."

1295
00:53:59.378 --> 00:54:01.191
SAM and LAURA: Around the well?

1296
00:54:01.191 --> 00:54:05.308
MATT: "Yeah! Northern center, like he said."

1297
00:54:07.309 --> 00:54:10.035
TALIESIN: I've always been a fan of a haunted well.

1298
00:54:10.035 --> 00:54:12.686
MARISHA: Does it sing back to you when you sing into it?

1299
00:54:12.686 --> 00:54:15.379
TALIESIN: I mean wells are great.

1300
00:54:15.379 --> 00:54:17.741
MATTL "You talking about Ol' Potis, right?"

1301
00:54:17.741 --> 00:54:19.248
SAM: Yeah, Potis.

1302
00:54:19.248 --> 00:54:20.468
MARISHA: Did you know him?

1303
00:54:20.468 --> 00:54:23.240
MATT: "I seen him around, but they killed him.

1304
00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:27.393
"He's being fed to the pigs outside the butchery. (giggles)"

1305
00:54:27.393 --> 00:54:31.304
TALIESIN: Did he seem sound of mind before he went or no?

1306
00:54:31.304 --> 00:54:32.852
MATT: "Sound mind as someone can be if they

1307
00:54:32.852 --> 00:54:34.850
"went and killed their whole family."

1308
00:54:34.850 --> 00:54:36.395
LIAM: That's a fair point.

1309
00:54:36.395 --> 00:54:37.654
MARISHA: Do you know where he worked?

1310
00:54:37.654 --> 00:54:39.446
What he did for a living?

1311
00:54:39.446 --> 00:54:41.241
MATT: "No, I didn't give a shit!"

1312
00:54:41.241 --> 00:54:42.546
LAURA: Wait, his body's still there?

1313
00:54:42.546 --> 00:54:45.688
SAM: At the butchery? Where the rotten meat was?

1314
00:54:45.688 --> 00:54:47.272
MATT: "I don't know, maybe."

1315
00:54:47.272 --> 00:54:48.105
MARISHA: If the pigs haven't eaten it,

1316
00:54:48.105 --> 00:54:49.313
we can go check it out.

1317
00:54:49.313 --> 00:54:51.022
SAM: If the pigs are eating it, and the meat

1318
00:54:51.022 --> 00:54:53.183
is getting rotten, that's why.

1319
00:54:53.183 --> 00:54:56.690
Maybe it's a corrupt body or something.

1320
00:54:56.690 --> 00:54:58.732
MATT: "Come to think of it, I think Ol' Potis

1321
00:54:58.732 --> 00:55:02.419
"lived up there in the north center."

1322
00:55:02.419 --> 00:55:03.542
LAURA: That's where we were.

1323
00:55:03.542 --> 00:55:04.375
MARISHA: We were there.

1324
00:55:04.375 --> 00:55:05.208
SAM: We were there already.

1325
00:55:05.208 --> 00:55:06.397
LAURA: We should go check the well there.

1326
00:55:06.397 --> 00:55:07.779
SAM: All right, we're going to just zip around up there.

1327
00:55:07.779 --> 00:55:09.654
MATT: "So what's your name, eh?"

1328
00:55:09.654 --> 00:55:11.803
SAM and LAURA: (sounds of uncertainty)

1329
00:55:11.803 --> 00:55:15.570
(laughter)

1330
00:55:15.570 --> 00:55:16.782
LAURA: She already has--

1331
00:55:16.782 --> 00:55:18.333
SAM: I'm with her.

1332
00:55:18.333 --> 00:55:19.778
LAURA: That's right.

1333
00:55:19.778 --> 00:55:23.601
MATT: "Ah. So what's your name?"

1334
00:55:23.601 --> 00:55:25.042
SAM: Oh god.

1335
00:55:26.851 --> 00:55:29.497
LAURA: No, I'm not going to tell you that, okay bye.

1336
00:55:29.497 --> 00:55:33.214
(laughter)

1337
00:55:35.817 --> 00:55:39.075
MATT: You guys may go to the tavern. Where are you going?

1338
00:55:39.075 --> 00:55:41.400
TALIESIN: Well, I got a crazy idea.

1339
00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:42.744
LAURA: I think we should go find the body.

1340
00:55:42.744 --> 00:55:43.883
TALIESIN: I think, well we can--

1341
00:55:43.883 --> 00:55:44.737
SAM: Is your crazy idea to go to

1342
00:55:44.737 --> 00:55:46.002
the northern center of the town?

1343
00:55:46.002 --> 00:55:48.926
(laughter)

1344
00:55:48.926 --> 00:55:50.851
Because if it's not, it's a crazy idea.

1345
00:55:50.851 --> 00:55:53.920
TALIESIN: That's half my crazy idea. I think we should--

1346
00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:55.583
LIAM: We head south.

1347
00:55:55.583 --> 00:55:59.699
TALIESIN: We should-- this whole conversation's going south.

1348
00:56:00.661 --> 00:56:03.657
If we go do a quick bit of investigation,

1349
00:56:03.657 --> 00:56:05.816
come back, take a long nap, and go to

1350
00:56:05.816 --> 00:56:08.899
the northern square of town at night.

1351
00:56:09.846 --> 00:56:11.068
Late at night.

1352
00:56:11.068 --> 00:56:12.576
MARISHA: Sweet, yeah, and then listen for howls.

1353
00:56:12.576 --> 00:56:15.310
SAM: We can't do that with Beau.

1354
00:56:15.310 --> 00:56:17.632
Beau has an appointment tonight.

1355
00:56:17.632 --> 00:56:20.815
LAURA: Well, maybe her training will only be

1356
00:56:20.815 --> 00:56:21.656
a little bit of time.

1357
00:56:21.656 --> 00:56:22.769
MARISHA: I'll meet up with you guys afterwards.

1358
00:56:22.769 --> 00:56:24.478
SAM: Well, you want to do it alone anyway, right?

1359
00:56:24.478 --> 00:56:25.654
TRAVIS: Yeah, she'll be fine.

1360
00:56:25.654 --> 00:56:26.713
We'll be fine.

1361
00:56:26.713 --> 00:56:30.222
MARISHA: If you guys camp out at Ol' Potus' house, Portus'?

1362
00:56:30.222 --> 00:56:31.055
LAURA: Potus.

1363
00:56:31.055 --> 00:56:31.888
MARISHA: Potus.

1364
00:56:31.888 --> 00:56:34.174
If you camp out at his house, just,

1365
00:56:34.174 --> 00:56:36.983
I mean, you know it'll be empty.

1366
00:56:36.983 --> 00:56:38.345
TALIESIN: We'll find that well.

1367
00:56:38.345 --> 00:56:39.606
Maybe find the body.

1368
00:56:39.606 --> 00:56:40.948
LARUA: We should take a long rest.

1369
00:56:40.948 --> 00:56:41.781
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1370
00:56:41.781 --> 00:56:45.448
LAURA: (stammering) He was, he was executed...

1371
00:56:46.777 --> 00:56:49.180
...somewhere around there, right?

1372
00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:50.853
SAM: We don't know where he was executed, but his body--

1373
00:56:50.853 --> 00:56:54.272
LAURA: Somebody already told us where he was executed!

1374
00:56:54.272 --> 00:56:55.330
SAM: He lived up there.

1375
00:56:55.330 --> 00:56:56.763
LAURA: Caleb, you remember everything.

1376
00:56:56.763 --> 00:56:57.654
Where was the execution?

1377
00:56:57.654 --> 00:56:59.690
LIAM: No, I don't, but Caleb does.

1378
00:56:59.690 --> 00:57:01.562
However, was the party told where he was executed?

1379
00:57:01.562 --> 00:57:02.415
LAURA: Yeah.

1380
00:57:02.415 --> 00:57:03.714
TRAVIS: In the northern center.

1381
00:57:03.714 --> 00:57:04.611
SAM: He lived up there.

1382
00:57:04.611 --> 00:57:05.827
MATT: No, he lived up there.

1383
00:57:05.827 --> 00:57:08.168
As far as you know, he was executed

1384
00:57:08.168 --> 00:57:11.861
somewhere in the vicinity of the Scowl Square.

1385
00:57:11.861 --> 00:57:13.288
LIAM: Yeah, as far as we know.

1386
00:57:13.288 --> 00:57:14.879
TALIESIN: How long would it take to get to the well and just

1387
00:57:14.879 --> 00:57:18.658
check out that neighborhood and come back here?

1388
00:57:18.658 --> 00:57:21.533
MATT: Probably 30 minutes?

1389
00:57:21.533 --> 00:57:22.997
30 minute walk at most.

1390
00:57:22.997 --> 00:57:27.213
TALIESIN: Let's examine the well and

1391
00:57:27.213 --> 00:57:28.344
the territories, so to speak.

1392
00:57:28.344 --> 00:57:29.976
Let's get a good idea of what this place

1393
00:57:29.976 --> 00:57:31.564
looks like during daylight, and then get

1394
00:57:31.564 --> 00:57:35.573
a good nap, and come back at night.

1395
00:57:35.573 --> 00:57:38.632
TRAVIS: Which group leaves first?

1396
00:57:38.632 --> 00:57:40.645
LAURA: I'll go first.

1397
00:57:40.645 --> 00:57:41.992
MATT: Who's doing what?

1398
00:57:41.992 --> 00:57:43.459
LAURA: We're all going there together,

1399
00:57:43.459 --> 00:57:44.925
but we're leaving at separate times

1400
00:57:44.925 --> 00:57:46.756
so it don't look like we're together.

1401
00:57:46.756 --> 00:57:48.631
MATT: You're going to the well only right?

1402
00:57:48.631 --> 00:57:49.851
LAURA: Yes, around there.

1403
00:57:49.851 --> 00:57:50.684
MATT: Okay.

1404
00:57:51.523 --> 00:57:53.072
SAM: Left side of the table, right side of the table.

1405
00:57:53.072 --> 00:57:54.052
LAURA: All right, let's go.

1406
00:57:54.052 --> 00:57:56.236
MARISHA: Sounds good.

1407
00:57:56.236 --> 00:57:58.579
We trail apart from each other as we go.

1408
00:57:58.579 --> 00:58:00.210
MATT: Okay.

1409
00:58:00.210 --> 00:58:01.842
MARISHA: I go full crazy human.

1410
00:58:01.842 --> 00:58:04.592
MATT: Okay, show me full crazy human.

1411
00:58:05.472 --> 00:58:07.060
LIAM: It's just Marisha in a pose.

1412
00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:08.121
TRAVIS: Get in there.

1413
00:58:08.121 --> 00:58:09.181
SAM: Uh-huh, uh-huh.

1414
00:58:09.181 --> 00:58:10.648
MATT: That's good, all right.

1415
00:58:10.648 --> 00:58:12.034
TALIESIN: I was expecting more Tinkerbell.

1416
00:58:12.034 --> 00:58:14.031
LAURA: Yeah, that's good, that's good.

1417
00:58:14.031 --> 00:58:15.448
SAM: You're so cute.

1418
00:58:16.332 --> 00:58:17.807
MATT: Perfect, perfect.

1419
00:58:17.807 --> 00:58:22.807
Okay, so you guys make your way to that general region.

1420
00:58:22.821 --> 00:58:24.653
And you guys follow suit behind,

1421
00:58:24.653 --> 00:58:26.896
roughly half an hour after you said?

1422
00:58:26.896 --> 00:58:28.116
LAURA: Like 15 minutes.

1423
00:58:28.116 --> 00:58:29.665
MATT: 15 minutes? Okay.

1424
00:58:29.665 --> 00:58:31.089
LAURA: We're impatient.

1425
00:58:31.089 --> 00:58:33.128
LIAM: I think at this point probably

1426
00:58:33.128 --> 00:58:34.840
my spell has faded and I've seen

1427
00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:36.714
people getting by, so I'm just going to go

1428
00:58:36.714 --> 00:58:40.256
hood up and muddy face for the time being.

1429
00:58:40.256 --> 00:58:42.006
MATT: Okay, I will say...

1430
00:58:44.538 --> 00:58:46.205
Go ahead and make...

1431
00:58:48.772 --> 00:58:52.567
Just make a straight intelligence check.

1432
00:58:52.567 --> 00:58:54.400
LIAM: That's not that great.

1433
00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:55.910
That's a nine.

1434
00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:56.743
MATT: Okay.

1435
00:58:57.950 --> 00:58:59.283
LIAM: Going to be fine.

1436
00:59:00.191 --> 00:59:02.124
MATT: And a followup deception check for me,

1437
00:59:02.124 --> 00:59:03.199
if you don't mind.

1438
00:59:03.199 --> 00:59:05.126
SAM: Oh boy, multiple rolls.

1439
00:59:05.126 --> 00:59:06.427
LIAM: That's better.

1440
00:59:06.427 --> 00:59:08.342
That is an 18.

1441
00:59:08.342 --> 00:59:10.951
MATT: 18. Okay.

1442
00:59:10.951 --> 00:59:12.457
All right.

1443
00:59:12.457 --> 00:59:15.290
As you guys progress northward,

1444
00:59:16.284 --> 00:59:18.524
you get partway towards this neighborhood,

1445
00:59:18.524 --> 00:59:20.972
asking around, keeping an eye out

1446
00:59:20.972 --> 00:59:24.339
for what this north center region may be.

1447
00:59:24.339 --> 00:59:26.459
You can see there are continuation

1448
00:59:26.459 --> 00:59:28.410
of the neighborhoods here, buildings that

1449
00:59:28.410 --> 00:59:30.661
are decently constructed with

1450
00:59:30.661 --> 00:59:32.399
the materials that are available.

1451
00:59:32.399 --> 00:59:34.271
You can see a smattering of wood that has

1452
00:59:34.271 --> 00:59:36.349
either been scavenged from other parts

1453
00:59:36.349 --> 00:59:39.447
of the wastes from some of the drier

1454
00:59:39.447 --> 00:59:41.809
graywood trees that you've seen occasionally

1455
00:59:41.809 --> 00:59:45.515
clustered across these long, ashen fields.

1456
00:59:45.515 --> 00:59:47.753
You see elements of the purplewood

1457
00:59:47.753 --> 00:59:49.871
that you saw taken and utilized

1458
00:59:49.871 --> 00:59:52.599
on most of the exterior wall that

1459
00:59:52.599 --> 00:59:55.210
surrounds the outside of Asarius.

1460
00:59:55.210 --> 00:59:58.310
Everything here has this very unique,

1461
00:59:58.310 --> 01:00:01.157
clustered patchwork feel in its construction.

1462
01:00:01.157 --> 01:00:02.703
The buildings have roofs, some of them

1463
01:00:02.703 --> 01:00:05.068
are thatch, some of them are almost

1464
01:00:05.068 --> 01:00:08.739
like a terracotta, but haphazardly placed.

1465
01:00:08.739 --> 01:00:10.121
Some of them appear to be just additional

1466
01:00:10.121 --> 01:00:11.670
boards placed over it, and it

1467
01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:14.087
has a unique character to it.

1468
01:00:16.484 --> 01:00:18.682
You get about partway to what you assume

1469
01:00:18.682 --> 01:00:19.860
to be the center of town based on

1470
01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:22.019
the conversations you've had before

1471
01:00:22.019 --> 01:00:24.424
two orcish figures that are

1472
01:00:24.424 --> 01:00:27.901
brutish and a little intoxicated

1473
01:00:27.901 --> 01:00:29.763
wandering through the streets begin

1474
01:00:29.763 --> 01:00:32.658
saddling up towards your group. One of them

1475
01:00:32.658 --> 01:00:35.658
goes like, "Hey, what's this one here?"

1476
01:00:37.995 --> 01:00:39.955
You can see these heavy tusks

1477
01:00:39.955 --> 01:00:42.974
curling up from underneath the lower jaw.

1478
01:00:42.974 --> 01:00:47.136
They have a dull, dark, green/gray skin tone.

1479
01:00:47.136 --> 01:00:50.484
One of them, the eyes are very very narrow

1480
01:00:50.484 --> 01:00:53.067
and sunken back into the skull.

1481
01:00:53.907 --> 01:00:56.071
The hair itself heavily braided

1482
01:00:56.071 --> 01:00:57.499
in two strong braids they toss

1483
01:00:57.499 --> 01:00:58.968
over the front of the shoulders,

1484
01:00:58.968 --> 01:01:00.719
wearing leather armor, very muscular,

1485
01:01:00.719 --> 01:01:02.349
especially since you're no longer

1486
01:01:02.349 --> 01:01:05.530
going in swoll for an illusion.

1487
01:01:05.530 --> 01:01:06.918
By comparison, you've been around Fjord

1488
01:01:06.918 --> 01:01:08.223
for a while, the visual perspective

1489
01:01:08.223 --> 01:01:09.850
of what a full blood orc who lives

1490
01:01:09.850 --> 01:01:13.070
in a more physically taxing lifestyle,

1491
01:01:13.070 --> 01:01:15.108
as Xhorhas sometimes requires here

1492
01:01:15.108 --> 01:01:17.775
in the wastes, Fjord looks tiny.

1493
01:01:18.858 --> 01:01:22.033
They both walk up to you to talk to you

1494
01:01:22.033 --> 01:01:24.072
and look over to Fjord, and the second one

1495
01:01:24.072 --> 01:01:26.642
goes and directs attention towards you.

1496
01:01:26.642 --> 01:01:30.059
The first one's like, "Hey hey, what's you?"

1497
01:01:31.617 --> 01:01:33.200
LIAM: What do you need?

1498
01:01:35.284 --> 01:01:38.586
MATT: "You just, uh. I don't know."

1499
01:01:38.586 --> 01:01:39.836
"You look clean."

1500
01:01:41.398 --> 01:01:42.865
LIAM: I look clean?

1501
01:01:42.865 --> 01:01:43.698
MATT: "Yeah."

1502
01:01:44.842 --> 01:01:47.425
LIAM: You need your vision checked.

1503
01:01:48.512 --> 01:01:51.762
There's literally mud caked in my hair.

1504
01:01:53.084 --> 01:01:54.226
MATT: "Not enough."

1505
01:01:54.226 --> 01:01:56.428
He pushed you into the ground. Are you going to resist?

1506
01:01:56.428 --> 01:01:57.567
LIAM: Yeah.

1507
01:01:57.567 --> 01:01:59.811
MATT: All right, go ahead and make a strength check.

1508
01:01:59.811 --> 01:02:02.228
SAM: Bullies at the lunch table.

1509
01:02:03.667 --> 01:02:04.500
LIAM: 11.

1510
01:02:06.894 --> 01:02:08.566
MATT: Palm, giant orc palm just grabs

1511
01:02:08.566 --> 01:02:10.482
the front of your chest and shoves

1512
01:02:10.482 --> 01:02:13.374
you down into a mud puddle.

1513
01:02:13.374 --> 01:02:15.942
It splashes and cakes the outside of your coat.

1514
01:02:15.942 --> 01:02:17.628
The other one that's turned to you, Fjord,

1515
01:02:17.628 --> 01:02:20.032
goes, "Oh well, you're a scrawny

1516
01:02:20.032 --> 01:02:22.883
"little lad aren't you, yeah?"

1517
01:02:22.883 --> 01:02:24.801
TRAVIS: Yeah, I was never fed much.

1518
01:02:24.801 --> 01:02:26.349
MATT: "Yeah."

1519
01:02:26.349 --> 01:02:27.853
"It's tough out here, huh?"

1520
01:02:27.853 --> 01:02:29.034
(chuckles)

1521
01:02:29.034 --> 01:02:30.184
TRAVIS: Indeed.

1522
01:02:30.184 --> 01:02:31.903
MATT: "Is he your friend?"

1523
01:02:31.903 --> 01:02:32.736
TRAVIS: My friend?

1524
01:02:32.736 --> 01:02:33.569
MATT: "Yeah."

1525
01:02:33.569 --> 01:02:35.736
TRAVIS: No, that's my employee.

1526
01:02:35.736 --> 01:02:37.246
MATT: "Your employee?"

1527
01:02:37.246 --> 01:02:40.341
TRAVIS: Yeah, what, you never seen a servant before?

1528
01:02:40.341 --> 01:02:42.424
MATT: Make a deception check.

1529
01:02:44.627 --> 01:02:46.018
TALIESIN: How far behind are we?

1530
01:02:46.018 --> 01:02:46.851
TRAVIS: 18.

1531
01:02:46.851 --> 01:02:48.350
LAURA: 15 minutes.

1532
01:02:48.350 --> 01:02:50.459
MATT: 18. All right.

1533
01:02:50.459 --> 01:02:52.705
(laughs)

1534
01:02:53.718 --> 01:02:57.401
He goes, "You have a human servant?"

1535
01:02:58.534 --> 01:03:02.368
TRAVIS: As you said, I'm not the most imposing figure.

1536
01:03:02.368 --> 01:03:04.792
Might as well have this scum

1537
01:03:04.792 --> 01:03:07.541
do what I need to have done.

1538
01:03:07.541 --> 01:03:09.783
Wouldn't you agree?

1539
01:03:09.783 --> 01:03:11.089
MATT: The other one at this point,

1540
01:03:11.089 --> 01:03:12.677
while he's pushed you down--

1541
01:03:12.677 --> 01:03:14.022
LIAM: He's still holding?

1542
01:03:14.022 --> 01:03:15.322
MATT: No, he just pushed you onto your back

1543
01:03:15.322 --> 01:03:16.874
and you've landed and is stepping

1544
01:03:16.874 --> 01:03:19.457
forward to loom over you a bit.

1545
01:03:20.417 --> 01:03:21.801
Beau, are you doing anything?

1546
01:03:21.801 --> 01:03:25.013
MARISHA: No, I'm just looking crazy and freaked out

1547
01:03:25.013 --> 01:03:26.930
and I'm not looking them in the eye.

1548
01:03:26.930 --> 01:03:29.006
I'm just scowling behind the two of them.

1549
01:03:29.006 --> 01:03:30.799
LIAM: I am dragging some iron shavings

1550
01:03:30.799 --> 01:03:33.900
across myself and drag my hands apart

1551
01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:36.983
and double in size and stand back up.

1552
01:03:39.279 --> 01:03:40.112
MATT: Okay.

1553
01:03:41.684 --> 01:03:42.517
SAM: Nice.

1554
01:03:43.826 --> 01:03:48.826
MATT: As Caleb's form swells in the walkway of the city,

1555
01:03:49.010 --> 01:03:51.827
you're going to hear a couple of, "Wha? Huh?"

1556
01:03:51.827 --> 01:03:53.543
A couple of people look over--

1557
01:03:53.543 --> 01:03:56.551
LIAM: Do you need me to do anything, sir?

1558
01:03:56.551 --> 01:03:59.447
TRAVIS: Well, you done made him do his trick.

1559
01:03:59.447 --> 01:04:02.056
He gets that when he gets a little agitated.

1560
01:04:02.056 --> 01:04:03.278
TRAVIS: The orc that had pushed you takes

1561
01:04:03.278 --> 01:04:06.746
a step back and his head cocks curiously.

1562
01:04:06.746 --> 01:04:08.455
Looks over to the other orc and they both

1563
01:04:08.455 --> 01:04:12.654
look back at Caleb for a second and they both nod.

1564
01:04:12.654 --> 01:04:17.216
The one that was talking to you goes, "Hey, how much?"

1565
01:04:17.216 --> 01:04:18.049
TRAVIS: For him?

1566
01:04:18.049 --> 01:04:18.882
MATT: "Yeah."

1567
01:04:18.882 --> 01:04:20.624
TRAVIS: How much you got?

1568
01:04:20.624 --> 01:04:22.541
MATT: "How much does he go for?"

1569
01:04:22.541 --> 01:04:24.041
LIAM: The slender man?

1570
01:04:25.922 --> 01:04:27.839
TRAVIS: He's pretty valuable.

1571
01:04:29.101 --> 01:04:33.216
I don't know, I'd put it around 2,500 gold pieces.

1572
01:04:33.216 --> 01:04:35.416
MATT: They both look at each other and just walk off.

1573
01:04:35.416 --> 01:04:38.026
"Too rich for out taste", and they

1574
01:04:38.026 --> 01:04:41.655
bound off down the main thoroughfare.

1575
01:04:41.655 --> 01:04:43.491
TRAVIS: You change your mind, come back!

1576
01:04:43.491 --> 01:04:44.658
(whispers) What the fuck?

1577
01:04:46.259 --> 01:04:48.409
LIAM: (bad Fjord impression) Eldritch Blast.

1578
01:04:48.409 --> 01:04:50.614
TRAVIS: Nope!

1579
01:04:50.614 --> 01:04:52.349
LIAM: (shrinking sound)

1580
01:04:52.349 --> 01:04:54.816
MARISHA: I look around. How many people watched that?

1581
01:04:54.816 --> 01:04:57.141
As that was happening?

1582
01:04:57.141 --> 01:04:59.058
Who's paying attention?

1583
01:04:59.058 --> 01:05:02.891
MATT: You see a family of gnolls.

1584
01:05:04.688 --> 01:05:07.295
A family in the sense that you have one

1585
01:05:07.295 --> 01:05:10.128
parental figure, uncertain of gender,

1586
01:05:10.128 --> 01:05:13.794
and three smaller gnolls that are like (snarls).

1587
01:05:13.794 --> 01:05:16.073
They're these little kids, have you ever seen--

1588
01:05:16.073 --> 01:05:16.906
SAM: Pups?

1589
01:05:16.906 --> 01:05:18.723
MATT: Well, baby gnolls are not the most

1590
01:05:18.723 --> 01:05:21.250
attractive looking creatures necessarily.

1591
01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:26.183
They're very much like a very scared pocket chihuahua.

1592
01:05:27.164 --> 01:05:28.674
Ren Hoek style like.

1593
01:05:28.674 --> 01:05:30.060
(snarls)

1594
01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:31.038
Their eyes bulging.

1595
01:05:31.038 --> 01:05:32.624
LAURA: I like it.

1596
01:05:32.624 --> 01:05:34.575
MATT: They seem to be intrigued by the mysterious

1597
01:05:34.575 --> 01:05:38.075
growth and shrink of this humanoid figure.

1598
01:05:39.471 --> 01:05:42.492
Other individuals go about their day.

1599
01:05:42.492 --> 01:05:44.575
No others seem-- no issue.

1600
01:05:45.913 --> 01:05:46.996
TRAVIS: That was, uh.

1601
01:05:48.642 --> 01:05:49.809
You all right?

1602
01:05:51.742 --> 01:05:53.532
LIAM: I don't know what I'm doing.

1603
01:05:53.532 --> 01:05:55.487
I think we should leave this town soon.

1604
01:05:55.487 --> 01:05:56.320
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1605
01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:57.687
LIAM: I think I had better change my shape

1606
01:05:57.687 --> 01:06:00.498
again. I got a little confident.

1607
01:06:00.498 --> 01:06:02.533
TRAVIS: Did well though.

1608
01:06:02.533 --> 01:06:03.877
I mean you could've picked him up

1609
01:06:03.877 --> 01:06:05.507
and thrown him across the square.

1610
01:06:05.507 --> 01:06:07.218
It was restraint.

1611
01:06:07.218 --> 01:06:08.847
LIAM: I could not have done that,

1612
01:06:08.847 --> 01:06:10.599
but he thought I could have done that.

1613
01:06:10.599 --> 01:06:12.352
TRAVIS: I thought you could've done that.

1614
01:06:12.352 --> 01:06:13.899
LIAM: I could've done that.

1615
01:06:13.899 --> 01:06:16.387
MARISHA: No one should do that, though, or anything

1616
01:06:16.387 --> 01:06:20.177
like that. We are being watched here.

1617
01:06:20.177 --> 01:06:21.274
TRAVIS: Right, maybe we should--

1618
01:06:21.274 --> 01:06:22.579
MARISHA: If they find out that we're from

1619
01:06:22.579 --> 01:06:23.966
the Empire in any way, shape, or form,

1620
01:06:23.966 --> 01:06:25.752
we will be fucking executed on sight.

1621
01:06:25.752 --> 01:06:27.138
LIAM: Agreed Beauregard, but I need

1622
01:06:27.138 --> 01:06:28.605
my teeth to be able to enunciate

1623
01:06:28.605 --> 01:06:31.054
incantations, so I was just improvising.

1624
01:06:31.054 --> 01:06:33.172
TRAVIS: No, you did fine. We did fine.

1625
01:06:33.172 --> 01:06:34.843
Shall we continue moving?

1626
01:06:34.843 --> 01:06:35.676
LIAM: Yeah.

1627
01:06:35.676 --> 01:06:37.085
TRAVIS: Yep.

1628
01:06:37.085 --> 01:06:38.593
MATT: You guys eventually find you way

1629
01:06:38.593 --> 01:06:41.161
to-- the roads here

1630
01:06:41.161 --> 01:06:43.277
are rough in their construction.

1631
01:06:43.277 --> 01:06:44.989
They tend to weave, and there isn't

1632
01:06:44.989 --> 01:06:47.723
a very hardened grid pattern

1633
01:06:47.723 --> 01:06:50.374
to the construct of Asarius.

1634
01:06:50.374 --> 01:06:51.985
You get to a point where the roads

1635
01:06:51.985 --> 01:06:53.983
seems to shift and curve a bit

1636
01:06:53.983 --> 01:06:55.737
to almost have this, I want to say

1637
01:06:55.737 --> 01:06:57.486
almost a spiral feel to it where

1638
01:06:57.486 --> 01:06:59.364
the buildings have a slight curve to it,

1639
01:06:59.364 --> 01:07:02.911
and at elements you can see a few wells, actually.

1640
01:07:02.911 --> 01:07:05.400
There are a number of them throughout the city.

1641
01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:06.621
You come across two of them.

1642
01:07:06.621 --> 01:07:09.231
The first one catches your eye.

1643
01:07:09.231 --> 01:07:13.349
In this area, what would you like to do?

1644
01:07:13.349 --> 01:07:15.470
LIAM: We've just stumbled upon a well

1645
01:07:15.470 --> 01:07:16.895
in the general vicinity of where

1646
01:07:16.895 --> 01:07:18.035
we were looking to go right?

1647
01:07:18.035 --> 01:07:19.175
MATT: Correct.

1648
01:07:19.175 --> 01:07:20.358
LIAM: And no indication.

1649
01:07:20.358 --> 01:07:21.457
TRAVIS: Have we seen a lot of wells

1650
01:07:21.457 --> 01:07:22.882
as we walked to this area?

1651
01:07:22.882 --> 01:07:24.751
I mean are they commonplace?

1652
01:07:24.751 --> 01:07:26.178
MATT: You haven't seen any that are close

1653
01:07:26.178 --> 01:07:27.362
to the main streets and you mainly stuck

1654
01:07:27.362 --> 01:07:28.911
to the main streets. You haven't wandered

1655
01:07:28.911 --> 01:07:31.358
too far into the deeper aspects of the city.

1656
01:07:31.358 --> 01:07:33.641
TRAVIS: Is it that easy?

1657
01:07:33.641 --> 01:07:34.540
MARISHA: What, the well?

1658
01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:35.373
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1659
01:07:35.373 --> 01:07:37.720
Is that what we're looking for?

1660
01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:39.430
LIAM: I don't know, Fjord, maybe could you ask

1661
01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:41.178
someone if it is in working order and if

1662
01:07:41.178 --> 01:07:43.537
the water is clean and potable.

1663
01:07:43.537 --> 01:07:47.942
If it is cursed, they will say so or something.

1664
01:07:47.942 --> 01:07:50.555
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll take a gander around.

1665
01:07:50.555 --> 01:07:53.407
Who might I see in my near vicinity?

1666
01:07:53.407 --> 01:07:54.831
MATT: Make a perception check.

1667
01:07:54.831 --> 01:07:56.994
MARISHA: While he does that, I want to investigate the well.

1668
01:07:56.994 --> 01:08:00.660
Look for any markings or signs of...

1669
01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:01.966
MATT: Make an investigation check for me.

1670
01:08:01.966 --> 01:08:04.003
TRAVIS: 17, plus one, 18.

1671
01:08:04.003 --> 01:08:04.836
MATT: 18.

1672
01:08:06.995 --> 01:08:09.850
Further up the street, amongst these gathered tents,

1673
01:08:09.850 --> 01:08:13.685
huts, and shacks the individuals in this

1674
01:08:13.685 --> 01:08:15.848
neighborhood seem to live in, you can see

1675
01:08:15.848 --> 01:08:20.756
what looks to be a very burly looking bugbear.

1676
01:08:21.839 --> 01:08:23.959
Heavy muscles, big thick fur that seems

1677
01:08:23.959 --> 01:08:26.894
to curl at the elbows and the knees. The ears

1678
01:08:26.894 --> 01:08:30.192
themselves flop out into these tufts.

1679
01:08:30.192 --> 01:08:32.349
A big thick brow, and is in the process

1680
01:08:32.349 --> 01:08:34.470
of loading up a cart with heavy,

1681
01:08:34.470 --> 01:08:36.100
heavy sacks of some material that

1682
01:08:36.100 --> 01:08:38.589
you cannot quite make out at this time.

1683
01:08:38.589 --> 01:08:40.873
Hasn't seemed to notice your presence at all.

1684
01:08:40.873 --> 01:08:42.218
What'd you roll for investigation?

1685
01:08:42.218 --> 01:08:43.051
MARISHA: An eight.

1686
01:08:43.051 --> 01:08:43.884
MATT: An eight?

1687
01:08:43.884 --> 01:08:45.721
MARISHA: It was almost a 17 though.

1688
01:08:45.721 --> 01:08:46.697
Natural 17.

1689
01:08:46.697 --> 01:08:48.002
LIAM: It was a 20 in my mind.

1690
01:08:48.002 --> 01:08:49.877
MARISHA: It was almost a 23.

1691
01:08:49.877 --> 01:08:52.198
MATT: You go up to this well and look down inside.

1692
01:08:52.198 --> 01:08:55.300
This one has a slight tapered roof onto it

1693
01:08:55.300 --> 01:08:59.633
and looks to be a wench with a chain attached to it.

1694
01:09:00.558 --> 01:09:01.456
TALIESIN: Classic well.

1695
01:09:01.456 --> 01:09:03.251
MATT: Yeah, classic well.

1696
01:09:03.251 --> 01:09:06.634
It's built into the heavy mud of this area,

1697
01:09:06.634 --> 01:09:08.506
and looking down you can see, probably from

1698
01:09:08.506 --> 01:09:09.927
the recent rain and the water level

1699
01:09:09.927 --> 01:09:11.069
as it stands here, it's probably

1700
01:09:11.069 --> 01:09:13.104
10 feet down before it hits water.

1701
01:09:13.104 --> 01:09:15.050
The water looks a little bit murky, but it is

1702
01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:17.249
a functional well. It seems to be usable.

1703
01:09:17.249 --> 01:09:18.702
MARISHA: Can I crank it up a little bit?

1704
01:09:18.702 --> 01:09:20.068
MATT: Yep. (cranking sounds)

1705
01:09:20.068 --> 01:09:22.593
You pull it up and there is an iron bucket

1706
01:09:22.593 --> 01:09:24.224
affixed to the bottom of this chain that is

1707
01:09:24.224 --> 01:09:27.931
now filled with somewhat murky, muddy water.

1708
01:09:27.931 --> 01:09:29.803
MARISHA: I fill up my canteen a little bit with the water.

1709
01:09:29.803 --> 01:09:31.311
MATT: You got it.

1710
01:09:31.311 --> 01:09:34.297
TRAVIS: I make my way over to the bugbear.

1711
01:09:34.297 --> 01:09:35.130
MATT: Okay.

1712
01:09:36.127 --> 01:09:36.960
TRAVIS: Hey.

1713
01:09:38.654 --> 01:09:40.203
MATT: "Can I help you?"

1714
01:09:40.203 --> 01:09:42.078
TRAVIS: Yeah, this well over here,

1715
01:09:42.078 --> 01:09:46.145
is it functional drinking water?

1716
01:09:46.145 --> 01:09:48.155
People use this?

1717
01:09:48.155 --> 01:09:49.417
MATT: "Yeah."

1718
01:09:49.417 --> 01:09:50.559
TRAVIS: Right.

1719
01:09:50.559 --> 01:09:52.964
Anything funny about this area?

1720
01:09:52.964 --> 01:09:56.797
You see anything funny in the past week or so?

1721
01:09:57.653 --> 01:09:58.736
MATT: "Not really."

1722
01:09:59.975 --> 01:10:01.893
"Well, I got to go."

1723
01:10:01.893 --> 01:10:03.719
TRAVIS: Yeah, you do.

1724
01:10:03.719 --> 01:10:05.302
What you got there?

1725
01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:09.144
MATT: "Making a delivery."

1726
01:10:09.144 --> 01:10:10.486
TRAVIS: Making a delivery?

1727
01:10:10.486 --> 01:10:11.544
MATT: "Yeah."

1728
01:10:11.544 --> 01:10:13.504
TRAVIS: What are you delivering?

1729
01:10:13.504 --> 01:10:15.544
MATT: "Why are you asking?"

1730
01:10:15.544 --> 01:10:18.644
TRAVIS: I don't know, I'm real curious.

1731
01:10:18.644 --> 01:10:21.756
MATT: You see his eyes go a little bit panicked.

1732
01:10:21.756 --> 01:10:22.589
"I..."

1733
01:10:24.670 --> 01:10:27.399
"I don't know who you are."

1734
01:10:27.399 --> 01:10:30.013
He goes and puts it into the cart.

1735
01:10:30.013 --> 01:10:31.096
TRAVIS: Yeah, okay.

1736
01:10:33.077 --> 01:10:34.871
MARISHA: I think we should look around.

1737
01:10:34.871 --> 01:10:36.912
See if there's any other wells.

1738
01:10:36.912 --> 01:10:41.033
TALIESIN: We got to be catching up to them soon, right?

1739
01:10:41.033 --> 01:10:41.866
MATT: Not yet.

1740
01:10:41.866 --> 01:10:42.866
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm into it.

1741
01:10:42.866 --> 01:10:43.925
MATT: If you guys want to wait.

1742
01:10:43.925 --> 01:10:45.713
You can wait for them to catch up to you at this point.

1743
01:10:45.713 --> 01:10:47.385
MARISHA: We've got a message for when they get in the area.

1744
01:10:47.385 --> 01:10:51.548
SAM: Maybe we should settle up our tab and start going soon.

1745
01:10:51.548 --> 01:10:52.770
MATT: Two hours later.

1746
01:10:52.770 --> 01:10:53.994
We'll say for the sake of brevity,

1747
01:10:53.994 --> 01:10:56.114
at this point in time you guys, you leave

1748
01:10:56.114 --> 01:10:57.583
a little early and you catch up to them.

1749
01:10:57.583 --> 01:10:58.847
TALIESIN: I'm going to Yelp other wells in the neighborhood,

1750
01:10:58.847 --> 01:11:01.930
see if any of them have a low rating.

1751
01:11:03.291 --> 01:11:04.124
MATT: Welp.

1752
01:11:04.964 --> 01:11:05.901
MARISHA: Welp.

1753
01:11:05.901 --> 01:11:07.205
MATT: I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

1754
01:11:07.205 --> 01:11:08.958
TALIESIN: That was amazing. Don't apologize.

1755
01:11:08.958 --> 01:11:10.915
LIAM: That was a player style joke.

1756
01:11:10.915 --> 01:11:11.748
MATT: I know.

1757
01:11:11.748 --> 01:11:14.248
I get them every now and then.

1758
01:11:15.356 --> 01:11:17.187
You guys catch up to the rest of them,

1759
01:11:17.187 --> 01:11:18.289
as you're inspecting this region

1760
01:11:18.289 --> 01:11:20.956
on the outskirts of this spiral.

1761
01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.467
What do you guys do?

1762
01:11:23.467 --> 01:11:24.883
MARISHA: I think we should research other

1763
01:11:24.883 --> 01:11:25.791
wells besides this one.

1764
01:11:25.791 --> 01:11:27.135
LAURA: What's wrong with this one?

1765
01:11:27.135 --> 01:11:29.867
MARISHA: I just think it's one well sample--

1766
01:11:29.867 --> 01:11:31.988
SAM: They didn't say that it was coming

1767
01:11:31.988 --> 01:11:33.412
from the well, they said that

1768
01:11:33.412 --> 01:11:35.282
it was around the area of the well.

1769
01:11:35.282 --> 01:11:37.238
MARISHA: Yeah, but I think there are other wells.

1770
01:11:37.238 --> 01:11:38.542
This might not be the only well.

1771
01:11:38.542 --> 01:11:39.765
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and cast Light

1772
01:11:39.765 --> 01:11:41.598
down there, see if I see anything.

1773
01:11:41.598 --> 01:11:42.431
MATT: Okay.

1774
01:11:43.311 --> 01:11:46.577
You go ahead and glance and you cast Light on...?

1775
01:11:46.577 --> 01:11:47.760
TALIESIN: The stones beneath the water,

1776
01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:50.086
see if I can light it up to look inside.

1777
01:11:50.086 --> 01:11:51.636
MATT: Best you can tell it is murky water,

1778
01:11:51.636 --> 01:11:54.001
so you don't get a clear view of where

1779
01:11:54.001 --> 01:11:56.483
it might bottom out, but it does appear

1780
01:11:56.483 --> 01:11:57.912
to be a well that continues down.

1781
01:11:57.912 --> 01:12:00.643
It's got some dirt and sediments

1782
01:12:00.643 --> 01:12:04.064
that have been somewhat recently raised--

1783
01:12:04.064 --> 01:12:06.268
SAM: Fjord, why don't you go down there?

1784
01:12:06.268 --> 01:12:08.591
TALIESIN: The water looks healthy?

1785
01:12:08.591 --> 01:12:09.976
MATT: Make a nature check.

1786
01:12:09.976 --> 01:12:11.564
LIAM: In the middle of the day?

1787
01:12:11.564 --> 01:12:12.397
SAM: Sure.

1788
01:12:13.233 --> 01:12:14.316
TALIESIN: It's a one.

1789
01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:16.103
MATT: Super healthy.

1790
01:12:16.103 --> 01:12:16.936
TALIESIN: Cool.

1791
01:12:17.938 --> 01:12:20.049
TRAVIS: How wide across is this well?

1792
01:12:20.049 --> 01:12:21.636
Skinny, or pretty wide?

1793
01:12:21.636 --> 01:12:23.265
MATT: This one's pretty skinny.

1794
01:12:23.265 --> 01:12:26.015
It's about maybe three feet wide.

1795
01:12:28.115 --> 01:12:29.821
It's not a massive well.

1796
01:12:29.821 --> 01:12:32.430
TRAVIS: You know, I can't fit down there, Nott.

1797
01:12:32.430 --> 01:12:33.263
You.

1798
01:12:34.509 --> 01:12:36.959
I'm just joking, I wouldn't ask you to do that.

1799
01:12:36.959 --> 01:12:39.483
SAM: Caleb can make you smaller.

1800
01:12:39.483 --> 01:12:40.316
TRAVIS: Smaller?

1801
01:12:40.316 --> 01:12:41.805
SAM: Smaller.

1802
01:12:41.805 --> 01:12:44.334
LIAM: I drop my cat in the well.

1803
01:12:44.334 --> 01:12:47.020
MATT: (cat meowing, splash)

1804
01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:49.690
You hear as Frumpkin hits the cold--

1805
01:12:49.690 --> 01:12:52.050
LAURA: He's going to be so pissed at you!

1806
01:12:52.050 --> 01:12:55.879
MATT: As you look through, Frumpkin is not happy.

1807
01:12:55.879 --> 01:13:00.853
Frumpkin is down there, just cat paddling through the water,

1808
01:13:00.853 --> 01:13:04.404
surrounded by dark cold stone in a very very chilly--

1809
01:13:04.404 --> 01:13:06.067
LAURA: Lower the bucket!

1810
01:13:06.067 --> 01:13:07.699
LIAM: Does it go anywhere?

1811
01:13:07.699 --> 01:13:09.866
MATT: Make a perception check.

1812
01:13:11.539 --> 01:13:12.456
LIAM: Not good.

1813
01:13:14.399 --> 01:13:15.929
That's an eight.

1814
01:13:15.929 --> 01:13:17.687
MATT: No, it is cold water and

1815
01:13:17.687 --> 01:13:19.120
Frumpkin is not happy with you.

1816
01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:20.138
LIAM: Okay.

1817
01:13:20.138 --> 01:13:23.475
LAURA: While seeing that, I'm going to sit down on the

1818
01:13:23.475 --> 01:13:28.470
ground and close my eyes and cast Detect Good and Evil.

1819
01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:30.570
TALIESIN: Clever, clever.

1820
01:13:30.570 --> 01:13:32.935
MARISHA: I lift Frumpkin out of the well with the bucket.

1821
01:13:32.935 --> 01:13:34.158
MATT: As the bucket comes up you seem Frumpkin--

1822
01:13:34.158 --> 01:13:35.786
MARISHA: It's super cute. It's like a calendar.

1823
01:13:35.786 --> 01:13:36.827
MATT: Soaked.

1824
01:13:38.436 --> 01:13:40.272
(hisses)

1825
01:13:40.272 --> 01:13:41.249
And shakes off.

1826
01:13:41.249 --> 01:13:42.553
MATT: It's okay. He's gone.

1827
01:13:42.553 --> 01:13:43.979
MATT: Vanishes.

1828
01:13:43.979 --> 01:13:45.121
You cast Detect Good and Evil.

1829
01:13:45.121 --> 01:13:46.264
What's the range on that?

1830
01:13:46.264 --> 01:13:47.097
LAURA: 30 feet.

1831
01:13:47.097 --> 01:13:48.098
MATT: 30 feet.

1832
01:13:48.098 --> 01:13:50.097
You focus for a moment and concentrate,

1833
01:13:50.097 --> 01:13:53.699
waiting to find a way to focus on

1834
01:13:53.699 --> 01:13:56.255
the variations between universal

1835
01:13:56.255 --> 01:13:59.172
morality and universal evil intent.

1836
01:14:01.269 --> 01:14:03.063
Moments pass and nothing catches

1837
01:14:03.063 --> 01:14:05.267
your attention in a 30 foot radius.

1838
01:14:05.267 --> 01:14:06.517
LAURA: I'm going to get up and start

1839
01:14:06.517 --> 01:14:09.784
wandering around the area.

1840
01:14:09.784 --> 01:14:11.094
Look for little blips.

1841
01:14:11.094 --> 01:14:12.442
TALIESIN: Let's head to the other well while we're doing it.

1842
01:14:12.442 --> 01:14:13.826
TRAVIS: Is there a butcher shop over here

1843
01:14:13.826 --> 01:14:15.582
we're supposed to be looking for?

1844
01:14:15.582 --> 01:14:16.925
TALIESIN: No, there's another well though.

1845
01:14:16.925 --> 01:14:20.008
MATT: The butcher shop was back at the...

1846
01:14:21.167 --> 01:14:22.368
The Scowl Square.

1847
01:14:22.368 --> 01:14:23.429
You can make a perception check

1848
01:14:23.429 --> 01:14:24.688
if you want to look for something like that around.

1849
01:14:24.688 --> 01:14:26.848
TRAVIS: Yeah, I will. Why not?

1850
01:14:26.848 --> 01:14:28.233
A 12.

1851
01:14:28.233 --> 01:14:29.066
MATT: 12?

1852
01:14:32.106 --> 01:14:33.327
Okay.

1853
01:14:33.327 --> 01:14:35.450
You don't see a butcher shop in the vicinity.

1854
01:14:35.450 --> 01:14:36.755
You do notice that bugbear you were

1855
01:14:36.755 --> 01:14:39.120
talking to earlier has moved the cart

1856
01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:41.732
one block over and is now peeking around

1857
01:14:41.732 --> 01:14:44.748
the corner and watching you all at the well.

1858
01:14:44.748 --> 01:14:47.399
LAURA: I'm going to wander over towards him.

1859
01:14:47.399 --> 01:14:48.783
MATT: You wander over towards him?

1860
01:14:48.783 --> 01:14:50.655
LAURA: Yeah, just like (distracted mumbling),

1861
01:14:50.655 --> 01:14:53.671
(radar sounds).

1862
01:14:53.671 --> 01:14:55.914
This last for 10 minutes as I wander around.

1863
01:14:55.914 --> 01:14:56.747
MATT: Okay.

1864
01:14:57.946 --> 01:15:01.532
Nothing seems to catch your attention in this vicinity.

1865
01:15:01.532 --> 01:15:02.876
TALIESIN: I say we try the other well.

1866
01:15:02.876 --> 01:15:03.709
SAM: What other well?

1867
01:15:03.709 --> 01:15:04.665
What other well?

1868
01:15:04.665 --> 01:15:05.887
Have we seen other wells?

1869
01:15:05.887 --> 01:15:08.291
LIAM: We heard that there was another well in the area.

1870
01:15:08.291 --> 01:15:10.003
SAM: All right, well, let's go find one.

1871
01:15:10.003 --> 01:15:12.735
MARISHA: Also, Nott, I collected a little bit of water

1872
01:15:12.735 --> 01:15:16.038
from this well, do you have some empty vials?

1873
01:15:16.038 --> 01:15:17.911
SAM: I have two empty vials.

1874
01:15:17.911 --> 01:15:19.665
MARISHA: I don't know, you just might want to test

1875
01:15:19.665 --> 01:15:23.583
the water between each well. Maybe it's different.

1876
01:15:23.583 --> 01:15:24.681
SAM: Okay.

1877
01:15:24.681 --> 01:15:26.309
MARISHA: Erin Brockovich shit.

1878
01:15:26.309 --> 01:15:27.775
SAM: Sure, yeah, I'm a chemist, sure.

1879
01:15:27.775 --> 01:15:28.794
Fill me up.

1880
01:15:28.794 --> 01:15:30.504
TRAVIS: I walk over towards the bugbear again.

1881
01:15:30.504 --> 01:15:31.971
Direct line, straight for him.

1882
01:15:31.971 --> 01:15:33.156
MATT: Okay, as soon as you start walking

1883
01:15:33.156 --> 01:15:34.788
towards him he ducks behind the alley.

1884
01:15:34.788 --> 01:15:36.089
TRAVIS: I run after him.

1885
01:15:36.089 --> 01:15:37.556
MATT: Okay, you run and turn the corner

1886
01:15:37.556 --> 01:15:39.879
and he's just pushing the cart away.

1887
01:15:39.879 --> 01:15:40.712
TRAVIS: Hey!

1888
01:15:40.712 --> 01:15:42.045
LIAM: Where are you?

1889
01:15:43.058 --> 01:15:43.925
MATT: "Hello?"

1890
01:15:43.925 --> 01:15:45.757
TRAVIS: Why so jumpy?

1891
01:15:45.757 --> 01:15:47.348
I saw you looking at me. Why?

1892
01:15:47.348 --> 01:15:49.670
What are you hiding?

1893
01:15:49.670 --> 01:15:51.058
MATT: "I don't know what you're--"

1894
01:15:51.058 --> 01:15:52.689
TRAVIS: I'm not going to ask you a second time.

1895
01:15:52.689 --> 01:15:54.035
You don't want to know who I work for.

1896
01:15:54.035 --> 01:15:56.197
Tell me what you're carrying and what you're up to.

1897
01:15:56.197 --> 01:15:58.225
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

1898
01:15:58.225 --> 01:16:00.238
LIAM: Come on!

1899
01:16:00.238 --> 01:16:01.134
TRAVIS: 20.

1900
01:16:01.134 --> 01:16:01.967
MATT: 20!

1901
01:16:04.802 --> 01:16:09.517
He goes, "I'm very sorry, I've just

1902
01:16:09.517 --> 01:16:11.650
been having these dreams."

1903
01:16:13.898 --> 01:16:16.998
"You seem to be asking questions."

1904
01:16:16.998 --> 01:16:18.915
TRAVIS: You keep talking, I'll keep asking.

1905
01:16:18.915 --> 01:16:20.054
You don't want the other thing.

1906
01:16:20.054 --> 01:16:21.358
Tell me about your dreams.

1907
01:16:21.358 --> 01:16:22.540
MATT: "I don't even, I just--"

1908
01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:24.457
TRAVIS: Calm down, calm down.

1909
01:16:26.333 --> 01:16:29.583
MATT: "I live alone and it's so very lonely.

1910
01:16:31.094 --> 01:16:34.637
"I've been having these dreams where these

1911
01:16:34.637 --> 01:16:38.637
two beautiful bugbears come to me in the dreams.

1912
01:16:41.982 --> 01:16:44.732
"One is a very voluptuous bugbear.

1913
01:16:47.437 --> 01:16:49.520
"The other is very strong.

1914
01:16:50.917 --> 01:16:53.605
"They come and they take care of me."

1915
01:16:53.605 --> 01:16:56.913
TRAVIS: Wow, that sounds fascinating.

1916
01:16:56.913 --> 01:16:59.605
MATT: "But they tell me to do bad things,

1917
01:16:59.605 --> 01:17:02.422
and I've done a bad thing."

1918
01:17:02.422 --> 01:17:04.090
TRAVIS: You did a bad thing?

1919
01:17:04.090 --> 01:17:06.862
MATT: "Yes, my neighbors had some wolves

1920
01:17:06.862 --> 01:17:09.757
and they told me to kill them."

1921
01:17:09.757 --> 01:17:10.775
TRAVIS: Some wolves?

1922
01:17:10.775 --> 01:17:11.674
MATT: "I'm sorry."

1923
01:17:11.674 --> 01:17:12.775
MARISHA: You killed the--

1924
01:17:12.775 --> 01:17:15.140
TRAVIS: You killed your neighbor's-- listen, listen.

1925
01:17:15.140 --> 01:17:16.706
MATT: (tearfully) "I didn't mean to kill the wolves.

1926
01:17:16.706 --> 01:17:18.648
They told me to do it."

1927
01:17:18.648 --> 01:17:20.403
TRAVIS: You're doing the right thing by telling me.

1928
01:17:20.403 --> 01:17:21.711
I am somebody that can make this

1929
01:17:21.711 --> 01:17:24.117
go away, but I need more details.

1930
01:17:24.117 --> 01:17:25.625
You can walk away from here

1931
01:17:25.625 --> 01:17:28.401
scot-free without another worry.

1932
01:17:28.401 --> 01:17:29.708
Where were your neighbors?

1933
01:17:29.708 --> 01:17:31.827
Where do you live?

1934
01:17:31.827 --> 01:17:35.979
MATT: "I live a little further in the spiral."

1935
01:17:35.979 --> 01:17:37.608
TRAVIS: How long ago were these dreams?

1936
01:17:37.608 --> 01:17:39.441
When did you kill their wolves?

1937
01:17:39.441 --> 01:17:43.071
MATT: "It started happening about two weeks ago.

1938
01:17:43.071 --> 01:17:45.760
"I killed the wolves two days ago.

1939
01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:48.446
"They don't know it was me. Please don't tell them."

1940
01:17:48.446 --> 01:17:50.198
TRAVIS: They don't have to know.

1941
01:17:50.198 --> 01:17:51.704
Now have you had any more of these

1942
01:17:51.704 --> 01:17:53.460
dreams or just the one time?

1943
01:17:53.460 --> 01:17:56.724
MATT: "No, they've come by a few times."

1944
01:17:56.724 --> 01:17:58.784
TRAVIS: Okay. All right.

1945
01:17:58.784 --> 01:18:01.465
MATT: "They're very nice dreams."

1946
01:18:01.465 --> 01:18:02.465
TRAVIS: Sometimes.

1947
01:18:03.861 --> 01:18:06.467
MATT: "They're always very nice dreams."

1948
01:18:06.467 --> 01:18:07.895
TRAVIS: Okay, fair enough.

1949
01:18:07.895 --> 01:18:10.096
You ain't drinking from this well, is you?

1950
01:18:10.096 --> 01:18:12.096
MATT: "No, no, I live by one."

1951
01:18:12.947 --> 01:18:13.780
TRAVIS: Oh.

1952
01:18:14.798 --> 01:18:16.711
That's not as important to me.

1953
01:18:16.711 --> 01:18:18.955
Tell you what, we will wrap this up

1954
01:18:18.955 --> 01:18:22.021
if you will just take me where you live

1955
01:18:22.021 --> 01:18:24.262
and I'll make sure that your neighbors know

1956
01:18:24.262 --> 01:18:26.624
that someone else killed their wolves

1957
01:18:26.624 --> 01:18:29.723
and you can go about your business, you understand?

1958
01:18:29.723 --> 01:18:31.027
MATT: "Who are you?"

1959
01:18:31.027 --> 01:18:32.536
TRAVIS: You don't want to know that.

1960
01:18:32.536 --> 01:18:33.369
MATT: "Okay."

1961
01:18:33.369 --> 01:18:34.369
TRAVIS: All right.

1962
01:18:36.286 --> 01:18:37.671
MATT: "I live this way."

1963
01:18:37.671 --> 01:18:39.054
Then grabs the two sides of the cart

1964
01:18:39.054 --> 01:18:43.170
and pushes it forward and through the mud.

1965
01:18:43.170 --> 01:18:44.350
Are you going along with him?

1966
01:18:44.350 --> 01:18:45.369
TRAVIS: I'll turn around, look over.

1967
01:18:45.369 --> 01:18:46.715
Is anybody looking at me?

1968
01:18:46.715 --> 01:18:48.469
TRAVIS: You guys-- you jumped in the alley.

1969
01:18:48.469 --> 01:18:50.221
You guys just watched Fjord sprint

1970
01:18:50.221 --> 01:18:51.808
and vanish behind the corner.

1971
01:18:51.808 --> 01:18:54.891
TALIESIN: I'm going to slowly make my way there.

1972
01:18:55.764 --> 01:18:57.109
MATT: You guys make your way to follow

1973
01:18:57.109 --> 01:18:58.534
and you see Fjord, now glancing over

1974
01:18:58.534 --> 01:19:00.776
his shoulder, as this big burly looking

1975
01:19:00.776 --> 01:19:02.491
bugbear is wheeling a cart out of

1976
01:19:02.491 --> 01:19:04.159
the alley on the opposite end and further in

1977
01:19:04.159 --> 01:19:08.409
towards this slow, chaotic spiral.

1978
01:19:08.409 --> 01:19:10.188
TRAVIS: I'll very slyly put my hand down

1979
01:19:10.188 --> 01:19:13.697
to my side and motion like stay back, stay back.

1980
01:19:13.697 --> 01:19:15.530
LAURA: I'm following, though, because I want to

1981
01:19:15.530 --> 01:19:16.763
sense good and evil.

1982
01:19:16.763 --> 01:19:18.994
MATT: (laughs) How long does it last?

1983
01:19:18.994 --> 01:19:19.892
LAURA: 10 minutes.

1984
01:19:19.892 --> 01:19:21.358
MATT: You got it. All right.

1985
01:19:21.358 --> 01:19:25.921
MARISHA: I'll stealth follow.

1986
01:19:25.921 --> 01:19:27.514
MATT: Okay, make a stealth check.

1987
01:19:27.514 --> 01:19:28.574
SAM: We're all following, through, right?

1988
01:19:28.574 --> 01:19:30.041
LAURA: Yeah, we're definitely following.

1989
01:19:30.041 --> 01:19:31.135
SAM: We'll all stealth follow.

1990
01:19:31.135 --> 01:19:31.968
TALIESIN: We will?

1991
01:19:31.968 --> 01:19:32.801
Okay.

1992
01:19:32.801 --> 01:19:33.634
LARUA: Okay.

1993
01:19:34.675 --> 01:19:37.325
LIAM: Well, I rolled a four.

1994
01:19:37.325 --> 01:19:38.875
TALIESIN: Ten.

1995
01:19:38.875 --> 01:19:39.708
LAURA: 11.

1996
01:19:39.708 --> 01:19:41.481
TRAVIS: Did you make yourself both look different?

1997
01:19:41.481 --> 01:19:42.499
MARISHA: 22.

1998
01:19:42.499 --> 01:19:44.004
SAM: 26.

1999
01:19:44.004 --> 01:19:45.004
MATT: All right.

2000
01:19:46.791 --> 01:19:48.091
All right.

2001
01:19:49.651 --> 01:19:51.824
Continuing the forward, you're led through

2002
01:19:51.824 --> 01:19:56.470
a series of other roughshod roadways and walkways

2003
01:19:56.470 --> 01:19:59.887
between these shacks and huts and hovels.

2004
01:20:02.585 --> 01:20:05.720
Eventually about three streets up,

2005
01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:08.325
about eight to ten minutes later,

2006
01:20:08.325 --> 01:20:09.995
the spell fades unfortunately,

2007
01:20:09.995 --> 01:20:14.608
but he leads you to one of these haphazard neighborhoods.

2008
01:20:15.827 --> 01:20:18.892
Pushes the cart up to the side and leaves it there.

2009
01:20:18.892 --> 01:20:22.892
Turns back to you and goes, "This is where I live."

2010
01:20:24.192 --> 01:20:25.660
TRAVIS: Are those your neighbors?

2011
01:20:25.660 --> 01:20:28.494
MATT: "They're all this vicinity, yes.

2012
01:20:28.494 --> 01:20:31.534
"They mostly leave me alone."

2013
01:20:31.534 --> 01:20:34.550
TRAVIS: You killed all of their wolves, or just one of them?

2014
01:20:34.550 --> 01:20:36.907
MATT: "Oh no, they're the ones who had,"

2015
01:20:36.907 --> 01:20:39.025
and he points over and you can see

2016
01:20:39.025 --> 01:20:43.716
there's a house that has

2017
01:20:43.716 --> 01:20:45.949
a small tent out front,

2018
01:20:45.949 --> 01:20:50.012
and it's a simple, maybe 80-foot wide

2019
01:20:50.012 --> 01:20:54.733
cluster of driftwood and other elements

2020
01:20:54.733 --> 01:20:56.676
of scavenged wood that has pushed up

2021
01:20:56.676 --> 01:20:57.859
into the semblance of a home.

2022
01:20:57.859 --> 01:20:59.854
Then twine and rope has been used

2023
01:20:59.854 --> 01:21:02.995
to wrap around it. Imagine a series of rafts

2024
01:21:02.995 --> 01:21:05.483
that have been pressed together to form a house.

2025
01:21:05.483 --> 01:21:07.073
That's where it was.

2026
01:21:07.073 --> 01:21:08.620
You can see a large post

2027
01:21:08.620 --> 01:21:11.022
out front where chains were once affixed,

2028
01:21:11.022 --> 01:21:14.200
but now they're empty collars lying on the mud.

2029
01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:17.093
TRAVIS: I see. And the--

2030
01:21:17.093 --> 01:21:18.709
MATT: "I didn't mind the wolves,

2031
01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:20.310
"they just told me to kill--"

2032
01:21:20.310 --> 01:21:22.800
TRAVIS: Keep your voice down.

2033
01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:24.506
MATT: "They told me to kill them."

2034
01:21:24.506 --> 01:21:27.523
TRAVIS: All right, now where is this fountain?

2035
01:21:27.523 --> 01:21:28.705
MATT: "Fountain?"

2036
01:21:28.705 --> 01:21:31.356
TRAVIS: Yeah, you said you lived by a fountain?

2037
01:21:31.356 --> 01:21:33.106
I mean a well, sorry.

2038
01:21:34.208 --> 01:21:36.695
MATT: "It's right over this way."

2039
01:21:36.695 --> 01:21:39.223
He points over around the edge

2040
01:21:39.223 --> 01:21:41.574
and by about three other buildings

2041
01:21:41.574 --> 01:21:44.474
on a further right hand corner there is

2042
01:21:44.474 --> 01:21:46.634
a stone well similar to the one

2043
01:21:46.634 --> 01:21:48.181
you saw before, a little bit wider.

2044
01:21:48.181 --> 01:21:49.431
Four-foot wide.

2045
01:21:50.306 --> 01:21:54.639
Same setup with the crank, the chain dangling below.

2046
01:21:55.979 --> 01:21:57.486
TRAVIS: Let's take a look.

2047
01:21:57.486 --> 01:21:59.281
Walk over and look down into the well.

2048
01:21:59.281 --> 01:22:01.448
MATT: Make a perception check.

2049
01:22:02.339 --> 01:22:03.235
TRAVIS: A 13.

2050
01:22:03.235 --> 01:22:05.637
MATT: 13. You glance in.

2051
01:22:05.637 --> 01:22:09.227
I mean, daylight here is not prominent

2052
01:22:09.227 --> 01:22:11.469
as it is sometimes, especially in the

2053
01:22:11.469 --> 01:22:13.869
Menagerie Coast where you grew up.

2054
01:22:13.869 --> 01:22:15.661
The near perpetual cloud cover itself

2055
01:22:15.661 --> 01:22:17.942
is making it difficult to get

2056
01:22:17.942 --> 01:22:21.778
anything but a soft, diffused daylight.

2057
01:22:21.778 --> 01:22:23.654
Glancing down, your eyesight, although you

2058
01:22:23.654 --> 01:22:26.664
do have darkvision, which does help, you catch

2059
01:22:26.664 --> 01:22:30.419
the surface of the water about 30 feet down.

2060
01:22:30.419 --> 01:22:31.479
This is a deep well.

2061
01:22:31.479 --> 01:22:33.352
TRAVIS: Murky as the other one was?

2062
01:22:33.352 --> 01:22:34.901
MATT: You can't make out too much

2063
01:22:34.901 --> 01:22:38.200
beyond the surface of it at this distance.

2064
01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:39.544
Just because of the nature of darkvision,

2065
01:22:39.544 --> 01:22:41.005
you don't see shapes moving in it,

2066
01:22:41.005 --> 01:22:42.924
you just see the surface of the water movement.

2067
01:22:42.924 --> 01:22:44.064
You don't know how deep it goes.

2068
01:22:44.064 --> 01:22:45.368
TRAVIS: I reach in and I take out a silver,

2069
01:22:45.368 --> 01:22:46.876
and I just turn it in my hand.

2070
01:22:46.876 --> 01:22:48.629
I look around, is anybody looking at this

2071
01:22:48.629 --> 01:22:51.400
bugbear and I conversing by this well?

2072
01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:55.451
MATT: Nothing beyond half of your not very stealthy party.

2073
01:22:55.451 --> 01:22:57.534
(laughs)

2074
01:22:59.220 --> 01:23:01.300
MARISHA: Fjord, we're here.

2075
01:23:01.300 --> 01:23:03.705
TRAVIS: If you happen to be asked about what

2076
01:23:03.705 --> 01:23:06.397
you did today, what are you going to say?

2077
01:23:06.397 --> 01:23:08.964
MATT: "I'm going to say nothing.

2078
01:23:08.964 --> 01:23:11.491
"I'm very embarrassed that I've been

2079
01:23:11.491 --> 01:23:15.692
"doing things for these very pretty bugbears."

2080
01:23:15.692 --> 01:23:16.830
TRAVIS: That's right.

2081
01:23:16.830 --> 01:23:19.768
And did you speak to anyone today during your deliveries?

2082
01:23:19.768 --> 01:23:20.829
MATT: "I spoke to you."

2083
01:23:20.829 --> 01:23:23.030
TRAVIS: No, now we got to rehearse this.

2084
01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:24.705
That is the wrong answer.

2085
01:23:24.705 --> 01:23:25.683
MATT: "Oh, I'm sorry."

2086
01:23:25.683 --> 01:23:27.476
TRAVIS: I give you this silver, and this

2087
01:23:27.476 --> 01:23:29.756
never happened, and we never spoke.

2088
01:23:29.756 --> 01:23:30.736
MATT: "Okay."

2089
01:23:30.736 --> 01:23:31.569
TRAVIS: Take it.

2090
01:23:32.408 --> 01:23:34.158
Now what's your name?

2091
01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:39.903
MATT: He looks down, as I look at my notes.

2092
01:23:43.619 --> 01:23:45.995
"I am Umadon."

2093
01:23:45.995 --> 01:23:49.879
TRAVIS: Umadon. Umadon, you look pretty tired.

2094
01:23:49.879 --> 01:23:53.334
What happened when you were out delivering today?

2095
01:23:53.334 --> 01:23:56.472
MATT: "I was just doing my usual errands.

2096
01:23:56.472 --> 01:23:58.796
"Getting my supplies and my food."

2097
01:23:58.796 --> 01:24:00.670
Then he points towards the cart.

2098
01:24:00.670 --> 01:24:01.851
TRAVIS: Your food?

2099
01:24:01.851 --> 01:24:02.684
MATT: "Yes."

2100
01:24:03.776 --> 01:24:05.249
TRAVIS: If you don't mind my asking

2101
01:24:05.249 --> 01:24:07.003
before you go, what do you eat?

2102
01:24:07.003 --> 01:24:08.753
MATT: "Why are you so nosy?"

2103
01:24:08.753 --> 01:24:10.667
TRAVIS: Because it's my job.

2104
01:24:10.667 --> 01:24:12.010
MATT: "Okay."

2105
01:24:12.010 --> 01:24:13.357
He leads you back over towards

2106
01:24:13.357 --> 01:24:16.194
the house where the cart is, and he opens up

2107
01:24:16.194 --> 01:24:20.143
part of it and you can see inside there is dried meats.

2108
01:24:21.829 --> 01:24:24.396
Mostly potatoes and some of the hearty

2109
01:24:24.396 --> 01:24:26.760
foods that are generally farmed here.

2110
01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:28.509
You remember recalling that most of the

2111
01:24:28.509 --> 01:24:31.889
commerce here, some of it is coin,

2112
01:24:31.889 --> 01:24:33.847
some of it is barter and trade.

2113
01:24:33.847 --> 01:24:36.613
Some of it is just trade for work and

2114
01:24:39.013 --> 01:24:41.380
hired elements,

2115
01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:44.421
so all this cart appears to be just

2116
01:24:44.421 --> 01:24:45.912
things to sustain himself.

2117
01:24:45.912 --> 01:24:46.745
TRAVIS: Groceries.

2118
01:24:46.745 --> 01:24:47.992
Where do you do most of your shopping?

2119
01:24:47.992 --> 01:24:49.952
Last question.

2120
01:24:49.952 --> 01:24:51.420
MATT: "The Scowl Square."

2121
01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:52.972
TRAVIS: Yeah, we were just from there.

2122
01:24:52.972 --> 01:24:54.682
MATTL "This is where they come at night

2123
01:24:54.682 --> 01:24:56.849
"when I'm having my dreams."

2124
01:24:58.022 --> 01:25:00.796
He points through this small oval-shaped

2125
01:25:00.796 --> 01:25:03.479
window in this stone structure.

2126
01:25:03.479 --> 01:25:04.660
His place where he lives is

2127
01:25:04.660 --> 01:25:07.146
nicer than some of the surrounding buildings.

2128
01:25:07.146 --> 01:25:09.226
It's probably been here for a while.

2129
01:25:09.226 --> 01:25:12.648
It's small, it's like an L-shaped structure.

2130
01:25:12.648 --> 01:25:14.769
Maybe two rooms tops.

2131
01:25:14.769 --> 01:25:19.093
TRAVIS: Umadon, I'm going to make sure-- you know what?

2132
01:25:19.093 --> 01:25:21.131
I'm going to make sure you don't say nothing.

2133
01:25:21.131 --> 01:25:23.090
I'm going to come back this evening and visit you

2134
01:25:23.090 --> 01:25:24.945
and we're going to make sure that you haven't

2135
01:25:24.945 --> 01:25:27.736
said anything to anybody, you understand?

2136
01:25:27.736 --> 01:25:29.041
MATT: "No, but okay."

2137
01:25:29.041 --> 01:25:30.416
TRAVIS: You take your stuff

2138
01:25:30.416 --> 01:25:33.242
and you take it inside now, you hear?

2139
01:25:33.242 --> 01:25:34.075
MATT: "Okay."

2140
01:25:34.075 --> 01:25:35.263
TRAVIS: All right.

2141
01:25:35.263 --> 01:25:37.640
MATT: "You're not going to tell anyone about the dreams,

2142
01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:38.797
are you?"

2143
01:25:38.797 --> 01:25:40.907
TRAVIS: What dreams, Umadon?

2144
01:25:40.907 --> 01:25:42.090
MATT: "The ones I told you."

2145
01:25:42.090 --> 01:25:43.335
TRAVIS: No.

2146
01:25:43.335 --> 01:25:45.471
TALIESIN: I was waiting for it.

2147
01:25:45.471 --> 01:25:48.888
MATT: "You asked me about them a couple times."

2148
01:25:50.021 --> 01:25:53.497
TRAVIS: We never spoke.

2149
01:25:53.497 --> 01:25:57.169
Never happened. Okay? Never happened.

2150
01:25:57.169 --> 01:25:59.293
MATT: You're blowing his mind right now.

2151
01:25:59.293 --> 01:26:00.839
"But we, I, we were--"

2152
01:26:00.839 --> 01:26:03.935
TRAVIS: Uh-uh-uh-uh! Inside.

2153
01:26:03.935 --> 01:26:05.117
MATT: "Okay."

2154
01:26:05.117 --> 01:26:06.534
TRAVIS: Talk to no one.

2155
01:26:07.930 --> 01:26:08.828
MATT: "Okay."

2156
01:26:08.828 --> 01:26:09.845
TRAVIS: Go, okay.

2157
01:26:09.845 --> 01:26:11.271
MATT: Turns around and walks, which just

2158
01:26:11.271 --> 01:26:12.576
giving perspective here, this is

2159
01:26:12.576 --> 01:26:14.614
probably a good seven inches of pure

2160
01:26:14.614 --> 01:26:16.974
muscle and fur over Fjord this entire

2161
01:26:16.974 --> 01:26:20.194
conversation, but this demure demeanor

2162
01:26:20.194 --> 01:26:23.206
of this bugbear in the face of this

2163
01:26:23.206 --> 01:26:25.736
surprisingly intimidating half-orc.

2164
01:26:25.736 --> 01:26:27.489
Turns around and grabs the sacks

2165
01:26:27.489 --> 01:26:28.875
and looks over the shoulder once more

2166
01:26:28.875 --> 01:26:31.034
and then heads back into the front door

2167
01:26:31.034 --> 01:26:32.828
on the other side of the structure.

2168
01:26:32.828 --> 01:26:36.375
TRAVIS: It's the stubby tusks. Okay.

2169
01:26:36.375 --> 01:26:38.538
TALIESIN: We're all looking at the well at this point right?

2170
01:26:38.538 --> 01:26:40.413
LAURA: I'm staring at Fjord and the bugbear.

2171
01:26:40.413 --> 01:26:42.288
SAM: What's going on? What is it?

2172
01:26:42.288 --> 01:26:44.000
TRAVIS: You guys really suck at following

2173
01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.203
a decent distance behind.

2174
01:26:46.203 --> 01:26:49.507
I understand what your Expositor was talking about.

2175
01:26:49.507 --> 01:26:53.422
MARISHA: I actually feel like I did pretty good.

2176
01:26:53.422 --> 01:26:55.834
TRAVIS: So Umadon here apparently has been having

2177
01:26:55.834 --> 01:26:58.364
some dreams and killed some of his neighbor's

2178
01:26:58.364 --> 01:27:00.526
wolves because of them a couple weeks back.

2179
01:27:00.526 --> 01:27:01.663
LAURA: What kind of dreams?

2180
01:27:01.663 --> 01:27:03.129
TALIESIN: What kind of wolves?

2181
01:27:03.129 --> 01:27:06.966
LAURA: Like the dreams that you have? Wet dreams?

2182
01:27:06.966 --> 01:27:08.391
SAM: Probably the kind of dreams that

2183
01:27:08.391 --> 01:27:10.755
everyone in the area has been having.

2184
01:27:10.755 --> 01:27:12.711
TRAVIS: Yeah. More the homicidal variety.

2185
01:27:12.711 --> 01:27:14.262
LAURA: Did he say anything about them?

2186
01:27:14.262 --> 01:27:16.301
TRAVIS: Well, he said that this here well

2187
01:27:16.301 --> 01:27:19.485
might be something, and I noticed he had groceries

2188
01:27:19.485 --> 01:27:23.232
from the Scowling Market Square or whatever.

2189
01:27:23.232 --> 01:27:24.656
MARISHA: I'm going to do some type of investigation

2190
01:27:24.656 --> 01:27:26.693
on the well, on the well's water.

2191
01:27:26.693 --> 01:27:27.626
TALIESIN: Is there a bucket?

2192
01:27:27.626 --> 01:27:28.467
MATT: Roll an investigation check.

2193
01:27:28.467 --> 01:27:29.706
There is, similar setup to the

2194
01:27:29.706 --> 01:27:31.053
one previously, it's just a wider well.

2195
01:27:31.053 --> 01:27:32.072
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Light on the bucket

2196
01:27:32.072 --> 01:27:33.574
and drop it down in there to get a good look.

2197
01:27:33.574 --> 01:27:35.616
MATT: Okay. Make a perception check for me.

2198
01:27:35.616 --> 01:27:37.037
SAM: Come on, perceive high.

2199
01:27:37.037 --> 01:27:37.870
MARISHA: 20.

2200
01:27:37.870 --> 01:27:41.645
TALIESIN: Yeah! That's a 27.

2201
01:27:41.645 --> 01:27:42.562
MATT: 27, nice.

2202
01:27:45.095 --> 01:27:47.787
As you pull the bucket up and check the water,

2203
01:27:47.787 --> 01:27:49.378
it's a similar level of murkiness,

2204
01:27:49.378 --> 01:27:50.639
but the water level's much lower.

2205
01:27:50.639 --> 01:27:55.006
The water is 30 feet or so down the depths of this well.

2206
01:27:55.006 --> 01:27:57.206
As you begin to return it, Caduceus you cast

2207
01:27:57.206 --> 01:27:59.570
Light on it and the bucket becomes a light

2208
01:27:59.570 --> 01:28:02.028
and you just lower it down below and

2209
01:28:02.028 --> 01:28:03.937
it slowly recedes in lighting up

2210
01:28:03.937 --> 01:28:07.271
the rough earth and carved in stone--

2211
01:28:07.271 --> 01:28:08.903
MARISHA: Give me little flask, a little vial.

2212
01:28:08.903 --> 01:28:09.736
SAM: Oh, yes.

2213
01:28:09.736 --> 01:28:12.069
MARISHA: I get a little water from this vial.

2214
01:28:12.069 --> 01:28:13.951
Make a little notch, two.

2215
01:28:13.951 --> 01:28:15.388
This is number two.

2216
01:28:15.388 --> 01:28:17.630
I rolled a 20 on my investigation check.

2217
01:28:17.630 --> 01:28:19.177
MATT: Okay.

2218
01:28:19.177 --> 01:28:21.587
MARISHA: Looking for markings.

2219
01:28:21.587 --> 01:28:24.440
MATT: You look through it, no markings.

2220
01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:26.643
You and Caduceus both make the same observation

2221
01:28:26.643 --> 01:28:29.625
as you're lowering the light and the chain.

2222
01:28:29.625 --> 01:28:31.991
You notice that at roughly 20-foot

2223
01:28:31.991 --> 01:28:35.339
to 25-foot distance down below, before it

2224
01:28:35.339 --> 01:28:37.624
meets the water level, there is a section

2225
01:28:37.624 --> 01:28:41.330
where the haphazard stone and masonry

2226
01:28:41.330 --> 01:28:43.851
that's been placed to contain the interior

2227
01:28:43.851 --> 01:28:45.646
of this groundwater well seems to have

2228
01:28:45.646 --> 01:28:47.645
crumbled and fallen, and there is about

2229
01:28:47.645 --> 01:28:51.112
a three foot gap where the stone

2230
01:28:51.112 --> 01:28:53.154
has crumbled and looks to be some sort

2231
01:28:53.154 --> 01:28:56.154
of interior cavern or dark-shaded...

2232
01:28:59.346 --> 01:29:00.487
Tunnel beyond.

2233
01:29:00.487 --> 01:29:01.873
LAURA: Can I look around and see if anybody

2234
01:29:01.873 --> 01:29:03.091
is watching us right now?

2235
01:29:03.091 --> 01:29:04.719
MATT: Make a perception check.

2236
01:29:04.719 --> 01:29:06.185
SAM: I'm going to investigate these two vials

2237
01:29:06.185 --> 01:29:08.953
of water to see if I can discern any difference.

2238
01:29:08.953 --> 01:29:09.786
MATT: Sure.

2239
01:29:11.716 --> 01:29:13.999
LAURA: A 22.

2240
01:29:13.999 --> 01:29:15.224
MATT: 22.

2241
01:29:15.224 --> 01:29:16.814
I mean, you are a bunch of people standing

2242
01:29:16.814 --> 01:29:18.199
around a well and doing a bunch of

2243
01:29:18.199 --> 01:29:20.323
experimental magic casting and checking

2244
01:29:20.323 --> 01:29:23.055
water levels and looking deep inside.

2245
01:29:23.055 --> 01:29:25.337
Some of the folks around you

2246
01:29:25.337 --> 01:29:28.591
are staring and curious as to

2247
01:29:28.591 --> 01:29:29.934
what the fuck you're doing in the

2248
01:29:29.934 --> 01:29:31.485
middle of broad daylight here.

2249
01:29:31.485 --> 01:29:34.702
TRAVIS: Putting fluoride in the water folks, nothing to see.

2250
01:29:34.702 --> 01:29:36.210
MARISHA: Just a little public works.

2251
01:29:36.210 --> 01:29:41.168
MATT: They look to be denizens of the region. Nothing that

2252
01:29:43.484 --> 01:29:45.834
tips you off to think that they're concerned.

2253
01:29:45.834 --> 01:29:47.692
They're just confused

2254
01:29:47.692 --> 01:29:48.918
and at least are aware of your

2255
01:29:48.918 --> 01:29:50.727
presence and find it weird.

2256
01:29:50.727 --> 01:29:52.335
LAURA: Okay.

2257
01:29:53.536 --> 01:29:55.697
LIAM: You found something? What is it?

2258
01:29:55.697 --> 01:29:57.119
MATT: What'd you roll for it?

2259
01:29:57.119 --> 01:29:58.545
SAM: What kind of check is this?

2260
01:29:58.545 --> 01:29:59.645
MATT: It's investigation.

2261
01:29:59.645 --> 01:30:02.478
SAM: Oh investigation, that's better.

2262
01:30:03.519 --> 01:30:04.984
MATT: I'll say because you're an alchemist,

2263
01:30:04.984 --> 01:30:07.024
I'll let you add your proficiency modifier.

2264
01:30:07.024 --> 01:30:08.959
SAM: Yeah, that's 15.

2265
01:30:08.959 --> 01:30:10.386
LAURA: Plus your proficiency?

2266
01:30:10.386 --> 01:30:11.969
SAM: That's including.

2267
01:30:12.911 --> 01:30:15.397
MATT: They are slightly different, but you assess

2268
01:30:15.397 --> 01:30:16.907
it's because the ground water that

2269
01:30:16.907 --> 01:30:18.250
you're pulling from here is actually

2270
01:30:18.250 --> 01:30:20.287
deeper than the previous well.

2271
01:30:20.287 --> 01:30:22.206
The water still seems as pure as

2272
01:30:22.206 --> 01:30:25.914
groundwater pulled from a well can be.

2273
01:30:25.914 --> 01:30:27.748
Because it's deeper and seems to be

2274
01:30:27.748 --> 01:30:32.106
probably closer to the sediment and the base--

2275
01:30:32.106 --> 01:30:33.278
SAM: The aquifer?

2276
01:30:33.278 --> 01:30:35.354
MATT: The aquifer, if you will.

2277
01:30:35.354 --> 01:30:39.261
Is a little murkier, but it mostly seems to be natural.

2278
01:30:39.261 --> 01:30:41.459
LAURA: I take out a-- what is the

2279
01:30:41.459 --> 01:30:43.822
smallest amount of money, copper?

2280
01:30:43.822 --> 01:30:44.655
SAM: Yeah.

2281
01:30:44.655 --> 01:30:46.229
LAURA: I take out a copper and I go:

2282
01:30:46.229 --> 01:30:49.434
Oh, I wish I could detect good and evil,

2283
01:30:49.434 --> 01:30:53.185
and then I get down the well and I cast Good and Evil.

2284
01:30:53.185 --> 01:30:55.428
MATT: Okay. You cast it.

2285
01:30:55.428 --> 01:30:58.242
Close your eyes and focus.

2286
01:30:58.242 --> 01:31:00.993
Nothing catches your attention.

2287
01:31:00.993 --> 01:31:03.971
TALIESIN: Maybe walk in that direction for a little bit

2288
01:31:03.971 --> 01:31:05.806
and see if you feel anything. I'm sending her in

2289
01:31:05.806 --> 01:31:10.576
the direction of the opening that I saw in the wall.

2290
01:31:10.576 --> 01:31:13.383
MATT: Following that path, and you focus, you travel

2291
01:31:13.383 --> 01:31:16.889
around in a few loops, a few figure eights.

2292
01:31:16.889 --> 01:31:18.234
Basically the vicinity as Caduceus

2293
01:31:18.234 --> 01:31:21.287
is guiding you in that direction.

2294
01:31:21.287 --> 01:31:23.898
LAURA: I get down and crawl a little bit.

2295
01:31:23.898 --> 01:31:28.063
To get my face as close to the ground as possible.

2296
01:31:28.063 --> 01:31:30.121
MATT: It's muddy.

2297
01:31:30.992 --> 01:31:34.861
You get down low and foxhole your way across the ground.

2298
01:31:34.861 --> 01:31:38.327
The individuals who have been paying

2299
01:31:38.327 --> 01:31:41.260
attention to you oddly are now very curious

2300
01:31:41.260 --> 01:31:44.515
as to this display, and you can look over

2301
01:31:44.515 --> 01:31:47.204
and see one of them begins to walk towards

2302
01:31:47.204 --> 01:31:49.200
an armored Kryn soldier

2303
01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:50.587
that is in the process of walking

2304
01:31:50.587 --> 01:31:52.626
from the north to southern side of the

2305
01:31:52.626 --> 01:31:54.949
main street closest to where you are.

2306
01:31:54.949 --> 01:31:56.335
LIAM: Is that obvious to all of us?

2307
01:31:56.335 --> 01:31:57.476
MARISHA: Can I intercept?

2308
01:31:57.476 --> 01:32:00.745
MATT: Caduceus, you notice this and Beau, you notice this.

2309
01:32:00.745 --> 01:32:01.770
MARISHA: Am I able to intercept

2310
01:32:01.770 --> 01:32:02.803
before she meets the soldier?

2311
01:32:02.803 --> 01:32:04.170
MATT: You can certainly try.

2312
01:32:04.170 --> 01:32:05.985
MARISHA: I'm going to try.

2313
01:32:05.985 --> 01:32:07.785
I'll power walk casually.

2314
01:32:07.785 --> 01:32:09.945
MATT: You're quick, you're fast, I will make a--

2315
01:32:09.945 --> 01:32:11.657
MARISHA: I don't want to be alarming though.

2316
01:32:11.657 --> 01:32:15.118
Lifeguard rules, don't freak people out.

2317
01:32:15.118 --> 01:32:17.285
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

2318
01:32:18.339 --> 01:32:20.469
This is an attempt to change your

2319
01:32:20.469 --> 01:32:24.742
body language to not seem aggressive and inviting.

2320
01:32:24.742 --> 01:32:25.575
MARISHA: Persuasion?

2321
01:32:25.575 --> 01:32:26.408
MATT: Yes.

2322
01:32:28.742 --> 01:32:29.873
MARISHA: Eight.

2323
01:32:29.873 --> 01:32:32.279
MATT: Eight. All right, so you see...

2324
01:32:32.279 --> 01:32:34.395
SAM: (labored breathing)

2325
01:32:34.395 --> 01:32:36.010
TRAVIS: We're going to work.

2326
01:32:36.010 --> 01:32:40.993
MATT: You see a bugbear woman,

2327
01:32:43.277 --> 01:32:46.183
the hair going from a deep brown to a

2328
01:32:46.183 --> 01:32:47.699
sun-bleached blonde towards the tips,

2329
01:32:47.699 --> 01:32:49.576
maybe it's because of age or they're

2330
01:32:49.576 --> 01:32:51.978
from another region, you don't know.

2331
01:32:51.978 --> 01:32:53.850
She's been watching this for a while,

2332
01:32:53.850 --> 01:32:55.313
and as soon as this starts happening

2333
01:32:55.313 --> 01:32:56.779
looks over and sees the Kryn soldier

2334
01:32:56.779 --> 01:32:59.595
and just walks in that direction.

2335
01:32:59.595 --> 01:33:02.615
You start, well from your perspective,

2336
01:33:02.615 --> 01:33:07.262
very quietly and very openly walk in that direction.

2337
01:33:07.262 --> 01:33:08.727
She turns backs and looks and sees this

2338
01:33:08.727 --> 01:33:11.050
crazed human stepping over towards her

2339
01:33:11.050 --> 01:33:14.189
and starts picking up the pace.

2340
01:33:14.189 --> 01:33:16.791
The soldier glances over and sees her and sees you

2341
01:33:16.791 --> 01:33:21.273
and gives a curious look, specifically to you.

2342
01:33:21.273 --> 01:33:25.440
You can see this is a female dark elf soldier.

2343
01:33:26.286 --> 01:33:28.646
Not wearing full Kryn armor, that's what you

2344
01:33:28.646 --> 01:33:30.930
battled before, but elements of it.

2345
01:33:30.930 --> 01:33:34.797
No helmet, but the somewhat chitinous,

2346
01:33:34.797 --> 01:33:37.815
dark metallic armor and mantle across

2347
01:33:37.815 --> 01:33:39.768
the shoulders similar to the mage

2348
01:33:39.768 --> 01:33:41.725
that you had fought previously, but are

2349
01:33:41.725 --> 01:33:44.453
wearing plain dark leather armor beneath.

2350
01:33:44.453 --> 01:33:46.284
Begins to watch and then meets up with

2351
01:33:46.284 --> 01:33:49.295
the bugbear woman who immediately goes like.

2352
01:33:49.295 --> 01:33:50.639
"There's a woman,"

2353
01:33:50.639 --> 01:33:52.229
and turns and sees you approaching.

2354
01:33:52.229 --> 01:33:53.611
You're already right there.

2355
01:33:53.611 --> 01:33:56.625
TALIESIN: I'm going to slowly jaunt my way over as well.

2356
01:33:56.625 --> 01:33:57.583
LAURA: Oh god.

2357
01:33:57.583 --> 01:34:00.949
MATT: Okay. The soldier looks and says,

2358
01:34:00.949 --> 01:34:03.124
"What appears to be the problem?"

2359
01:34:03.992 --> 01:34:08.391
The bugbear goes, "I don't know."

2360
01:34:08.391 --> 01:34:10.586
She's looking at you deer in headlights.

2361
01:34:10.586 --> 01:34:11.687
Trying to respond, but didn't expect

2362
01:34:11.687 --> 01:34:13.196
you to arrive quite so quickly because

2363
01:34:13.196 --> 01:34:15.603
your Monk speed is pretty fast.

2364
01:34:15.603 --> 01:34:17.963
She goes, "Uh, hello."

2365
01:34:17.963 --> 01:34:21.312
MARISHA: Hi. Can I help you?

2366
01:34:21.312 --> 01:34:22.573
MATT: "There."

2367
01:34:22.573 --> 01:34:25.912
Points over at Jester on the ground crawling

2368
01:34:25.912 --> 01:34:27.951
in the mud and everyone's gathered around.

2369
01:34:27.951 --> 01:34:29.692
LAURA: I take my earring and I hold it up and go:

2370
01:34:29.692 --> 01:34:32.079
I found it!

2371
01:34:32.079 --> 01:34:33.172
SAM: Your contact?

2372
01:34:33.172 --> 01:34:35.087
LAURA: No, my earring I had dropped.

2373
01:34:35.087 --> 01:34:37.898
It was in the mud over here.

2374
01:34:37.898 --> 01:34:39.981
MATT: Make a deception check.

2375
01:34:44.831 --> 01:34:45.664
LAURA: 14?

2376
01:34:53.027 --> 01:34:57.795
MATT: The Kryn warrior glances over towards you,

2377
01:34:57.795 --> 01:34:59.128
glances back at the bugbear,

2378
01:34:59.128 --> 01:35:00.136
glances back towards you and goes,

2379
01:35:02.516 --> 01:35:06.412
"So where in Xhorhas are you from?"

2380
01:35:06.412 --> 01:35:09.996
MARISHA: Mystery solved, she found her earring.

2381
01:35:09.996 --> 01:35:12.279
We were drunk last night and she made a wish

2382
01:35:12.279 --> 01:35:14.968
in the wishing well and we thought maybe

2383
01:35:14.968 --> 01:35:16.640
she threw it down there, but it looks like

2384
01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:21.453
it just fell off, so thank you for your service.

2385
01:35:21.453 --> 01:35:22.786
And I walk away.

2386
01:35:23.775 --> 01:35:26.955
MATT: As you walk away, a hand goes on your shoulder.

2387
01:35:26.955 --> 01:35:29.070
"You did not answer my question.

2388
01:35:29.070 --> 01:35:32.935
"Please tell me where are you from in Xhorhas,

2389
01:35:32.935 --> 01:35:34.755
"human?"

2390
01:35:34.755 --> 01:35:37.701
MARISHA: I'm from a little bit south of here.

2391
01:35:37.701 --> 01:35:41.494
Where that woman is from. And I point to Yasha.

2392
01:35:41.494 --> 01:35:44.435
MATT: Okay, make a deception check.

2393
01:35:44.435 --> 01:35:48.272
SAM: Oh boy. So many checks, so many fails.

2394
01:35:48.272 --> 01:35:49.105
MARISHA: Fuck.

2395
01:35:49.105 --> 01:35:51.697
LIAM: Super cocked.

2396
01:35:51.697 --> 01:35:53.084
MARISHA: That's a better roll.

2397
01:35:53.084 --> 01:35:55.570
What was it, deception?

2398
01:35:55.570 --> 01:35:56.987
MATT: Deception, yes.

2399
01:35:58.503 --> 01:36:00.103
MARISHA: 22.

2400
01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:03.248
MATT: Okay.

2401
01:36:04.982 --> 01:36:07.795
The soldier gingerly removes her hand

2402
01:36:07.795 --> 01:36:11.128
and goes-- looks to the bugbear expectantly like,

2403
01:36:12.033 --> 01:36:13.700
"What, were you going to approach,

2404
01:36:13.700 --> 01:36:18.117
the bugbear goes, "It looks like she found her earring,"

2405
01:36:19.945 --> 01:36:22.473
and moseys off, looking at you

2406
01:36:22.473 --> 01:36:24.712
intensely and keeps a wide berth around you

2407
01:36:24.712 --> 01:36:26.910
and the rest of the group and heads off

2408
01:36:26.910 --> 01:36:29.887
into whatever business she was handling.

2409
01:36:29.887 --> 01:36:31.887
The Kryn soldier goes,

2410
01:36:35.472 --> 01:36:38.164
"Maybe it is not so safe to be this

2411
01:36:38.164 --> 01:36:41.497
close to the conflict looking as you do.

2412
01:36:42.567 --> 01:36:45.900
You should perhaps go south for a while."

2413
01:36:47.419 --> 01:36:50.883
MARISHA Thanks for the advice. And I walk away.

2414
01:36:50.883 --> 01:36:52.842
MATT: "Light be with you."

2415
01:36:52.842 --> 01:36:54.509
MARISHA: And also with you?

2416
01:37:00.263 --> 01:37:04.421
MATT: Tense moment averted with a very good deception roll.

2417
01:37:04.421 --> 01:37:06.744
You come back to where you are, there in this

2418
01:37:06.744 --> 01:37:11.744
small section between homes and foot pathways.

2419
01:37:12.574 --> 01:37:14.282
LAURA: I did not detect any evil.

2420
01:37:14.282 --> 01:37:17.174
SAM: Yeah, but it's far down. Your detection is only--

2421
01:37:17.174 --> 01:37:18.033
LAURA: 30 feet.

2422
01:37:18.033 --> 01:37:20.030
MATT: No good on that unfortunately.

2423
01:37:20.030 --> 01:37:21.130
LAURA: Yeah, no, that's fine.

2424
01:37:21.130 --> 01:37:22.474
SAM: We got to go down there.

2425
01:37:22.474 --> 01:37:24.022
Fjord, jump down the well.

2426
01:37:24.022 --> 01:37:26.205
LAURA: I thought maybe it was 15 feet down,

2427
01:37:26.205 --> 01:37:27.246
it would've been a thing.

2428
01:37:27.246 --> 01:37:28.550
TRAVIS: Yeah, no problem, I just hope over the edge--

2429
01:37:28.550 --> 01:37:29.943
LAURA: No, no, no, don't do that!

2430
01:37:29.943 --> 01:37:30.922
SAM: Go down, yes.

2431
01:37:30.922 --> 01:37:32.102
LAURA: No, don't!

2432
01:37:32.102 --> 01:37:34.508
LIAM: Jester and Beauregard are wiped out from--

2433
01:37:34.508 --> 01:37:35.810
LAURA: We're going to fucking rest,

2434
01:37:35.810 --> 01:37:37.157
that's what we said we were going to do.

2435
01:37:37.157 --> 01:37:39.932
SAM: No, we're not going to rest, we have to go down there!

2436
01:37:39.932 --> 01:37:43.302
My husband is dying because of you!

2437
01:37:43.302 --> 01:37:44.492
LAURA: Because of me?

2438
01:37:44.492 --> 01:37:47.591
SAM: Well, because you're scared, because you're scared.

2439
01:37:47.591 --> 01:37:49.953
LAURA: I'm scared that if you fall down, I won't

2440
01:37:49.953 --> 01:37:51.787
be able to heal you because I don't

2441
01:37:51.787 --> 01:37:53.908
have any fucking spells left.

2442
01:37:53.908 --> 01:37:55.169
SAM: We got Mr. Clay for that.

2443
01:37:55.169 --> 01:37:56.678
TALIESIN: I'm not going down there.

2444
01:37:56.678 --> 01:37:58.025
SAM: Well, neither am I. Fjord is.

2445
01:37:58.025 --> 01:37:59.366
TRAVIS: I'm going down into the well.

2446
01:37:59.366 --> 01:38:00.669
LIAM: It is not the time to do it.

2447
01:38:00.669 --> 01:38:01.928
MATT: Okay, make an athletics check for me.

2448
01:38:01.928 --> 01:38:03.963
LAURA: What the fuck? We said we were coming back at night.

2449
01:38:03.963 --> 01:38:05.776
SAM: We always say that!

2450
01:38:05.776 --> 01:38:07.078
MARISHA: What time is it?

2451
01:38:07.078 --> 01:38:07.911
TRAVIS: 22.

2452
01:38:07.911 --> 01:38:08.744
LIAM: Broad daylight.

2453
01:38:08.744 --> 01:38:10.744
MATT: 22, all right, decent.

2454
01:38:11.768 --> 01:38:16.668
The well itself is about four, four and a half feet wide.

2455
01:38:16.668 --> 01:38:20.909
You place both of your arms at full length

2456
01:38:20.909 --> 01:38:23.398
each side, you have just enough to move through

2457
01:38:23.398 --> 01:38:25.191
and grab onto elements and use your feet.

2458
01:38:25.191 --> 01:38:27.433
It takes you a while to get down there

2459
01:38:27.433 --> 01:38:29.796
carefully without plummeting.

2460
01:38:29.796 --> 01:38:32.688
You do so deftly, actually.

2461
01:38:32.688 --> 01:38:35.135
About ten minutes of slow climbing,

2462
01:38:35.135 --> 01:38:38.468
you reach the point where that break is.

2463
01:38:39.417 --> 01:38:42.108
The bucket dangles from the over bar.

2464
01:38:42.108 --> 01:38:43.939
The smell of wet iron hits you

2465
01:38:43.939 --> 01:38:45.608
as you begin to approach it as well

2466
01:38:45.608 --> 01:38:47.725
as the still water that seems to be

2467
01:38:47.725 --> 01:38:51.277
sitting there at the base of the well.

2468
01:38:51.277 --> 01:38:53.108
There's about a two, three foot gap

2469
01:38:53.108 --> 01:38:54.534
that you see here where the stone

2470
01:38:54.534 --> 01:38:56.735
has fallen either inward or outward

2471
01:38:56.735 --> 01:38:59.626
and it's not terribly big.

2472
01:38:59.626 --> 01:39:03.274
It's maybe three feet across, about that wide.

2473
01:39:03.274 --> 01:39:06.862
At times it splinters out and then closes in.

2474
01:39:06.862 --> 01:39:10.314
Make an investigation check for me.

2475
01:39:10.314 --> 01:39:11.453
TRAVIS: 23.

2476
01:39:11.453 --> 01:39:16.453
MATT: It does appear to have been pushed towards the well.

2477
01:39:16.471 --> 01:39:18.264
TRAVIS: What does?

2478
01:39:18.264 --> 01:39:19.939
MATT: Where the stone seems to have crumbled,

2479
01:39:19.939 --> 01:39:24.094
it seems to have been pushed from the opposite side.

2480
01:39:24.094 --> 01:39:25.725
It's probably, whatever stones were there

2481
01:39:25.725 --> 01:39:28.984
are probably sitting at the bottom of this well water.

2482
01:39:28.984 --> 01:39:32.807
The other thing you notice is the smell here.

2483
01:39:32.807 --> 01:39:37.807
It is stale with dust and earth and rain,

2484
01:39:38.562 --> 01:39:43.470
and a hint of a pungent, sulfurous smell.

2485
01:39:45.094 --> 01:39:48.437
TRAVIS: Does it smell similar to the smell

2486
01:39:48.437 --> 01:39:53.089
we experienced down under the moorbounders?

2487
01:39:53.089 --> 01:39:55.697
MATT: Comparably? Pretty close.

2488
01:39:55.697 --> 01:39:57.083
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's about all I need.

2489
01:39:57.083 --> 01:39:59.363
I'll use the feature of the falchion

2490
01:39:59.363 --> 01:40:01.684
to Misty Step back up just underneath

2491
01:40:01.684 --> 01:40:04.536
the ridge of the well, my fingers on the side.

2492
01:40:04.536 --> 01:40:07.608
MATT: Okay. There's a sudden (tsssh) of wind and you watch

2493
01:40:07.608 --> 01:40:09.508
as Fjord's fingers appear and grasp

2494
01:40:09.508 --> 01:40:11.014
onto the edge of the well.

2495
01:40:11.014 --> 01:40:12.361
Pulls himself back up out of it.

2496
01:40:12.361 --> 01:40:15.011
TRAVIS: I climb up. That's what we want.

2497
01:40:15.011 --> 01:40:18.390
It had the same smell as down beneath the moorbounders.

2498
01:40:18.390 --> 01:40:20.593
LIAM: Okay, maybe not so much crawling

2499
01:40:20.593 --> 01:40:22.674
around the well or circus tricks.

2500
01:40:22.674 --> 01:40:24.384
Jester and Beauregard are barely on their feet,

2501
01:40:24.384 --> 01:40:26.294
let's get out of here, have something

2502
01:40:26.294 --> 01:40:29.068
to eat, rest, and come back in the night.

2503
01:40:29.068 --> 01:40:30.655
LAURA: Going to sleep for eight hours.

2504
01:40:30.655 --> 01:40:32.001
LIAM: Nott the Brave, it was your idea

2505
01:40:32.001 --> 01:40:33.836
to try to curry favor here in town.

2506
01:40:33.836 --> 01:40:35.949
We are not going to run off; this was your idea.

2507
01:40:35.949 --> 01:40:37.987
SAM: I'm totally fine with that, let's go rest

2508
01:40:37.987 --> 01:40:40.820
now that we know what we're doing.

2509
01:40:41.943 --> 01:40:46.026
LAURA: We're going to go rent a room at the Four Corners.

2510
01:40:47.164 --> 01:40:48.873
LIAM: The Four Seasons.

2511
01:40:48.873 --> 01:40:50.545
MATT: You head to the Four Corners' pens.

2512
01:40:50.545 --> 01:40:53.432
SAM: Is it like one of those Japanese,

2513
01:40:53.432 --> 01:40:55.340
you know those little capsule hotels?

2514
01:40:55.340 --> 01:40:56.724
LAURA: Nap hotels.

2515
01:40:56.724 --> 01:41:00.985
MATT: It looks like a stable for people.

2516
01:41:00.985 --> 01:41:05.985
It's an open space, like imagine a series of cubbies.

2517
01:41:06.064 --> 01:41:07.082
TALIESIN: It's a hostel.

2518
01:41:07.082 --> 01:41:08.949
MATT: It's a hostel, if you will.

2519
01:41:08.949 --> 01:41:13.949
The floor is stone, pebbles, molded hay,

2520
01:41:14.089 --> 01:41:16.818
and whatever bits of bedding and leather

2521
01:41:16.818 --> 01:41:18.734
could be thrown over it to try and give

2522
01:41:18.734 --> 01:41:21.234
a semblance of a softer floor.

2523
01:41:22.284 --> 01:41:24.282
The good news: it's cheap.

2524
01:41:24.282 --> 01:41:25.992
There's only two of these sections

2525
01:41:25.992 --> 01:41:28.153
that are available and they cost you

2526
01:41:28.153 --> 01:41:30.479
an ask of five copper a night.

2527
01:41:30.479 --> 01:41:32.272
LIAM: There's no tables or chairs or beds

2528
01:41:32.272 --> 01:41:34.655
or anything. It's just cow pens for humanoids.

2529
01:41:34.655 --> 01:41:35.488
MATT: Yes.

2530
01:41:35.488 --> 01:41:36.321
LIAM: Excellent.

2531
01:41:36.321 --> 01:41:37.154
TRAVIS: Great.

2532
01:41:37.154 --> 01:41:38.580
TALIESIN: I'm into it.

2533
01:41:38.580 --> 01:41:39.843
MARISHA: Sure, we'll take them both.

2534
01:41:39.843 --> 01:41:40.981
MATT: The two that are available, at least.

2535
01:41:40.981 --> 01:41:42.162
You can't look in the others; they're closed off.

2536
01:41:42.162 --> 01:41:43.120
LAURA: Are they next to each other or

2537
01:41:43.120 --> 01:41:43.953
are they in separate areas?

2538
01:41:43.953 --> 01:41:44.897
MATT: They're separate.

2539
01:41:44.897 --> 01:41:46.705
LAURA: Damn it. Okay.

2540
01:41:46.705 --> 01:41:48.360
MATT: There's one that's to the far back corner

2541
01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:50.193
and the other one appears to be maybe four

2542
01:41:50.193 --> 01:41:54.066
of those separate sections down and to the right.

2543
01:41:54.066 --> 01:41:54.899
LAURA: Okay.

2544
01:41:55.899 --> 01:41:57.158
TRAVIS: Taking both, yeah?

2545
01:41:57.158 --> 01:41:58.909
MATT: You can take both if you want.

2546
01:41:58.909 --> 01:42:00.538
Who's staying in which one?

2547
01:42:00.538 --> 01:42:02.128
LIAM: Well, we don't have three rooms

2548
01:42:02.128 --> 01:42:03.677
which we normally have, so I feel like

2549
01:42:03.677 --> 01:42:05.227
the ladies and the gentlemen should split up.

2550
01:42:05.227 --> 01:42:07.099
SAM: Girls and boys.

2551
01:42:07.099 --> 01:42:08.674
TRAVIS: I mean, are y'all going to be

2552
01:42:08.674 --> 01:42:10.457
all right by yourselves?

2553
01:42:10.457 --> 01:42:12.604
Jester, are you going to be safe?

2554
01:42:12.604 --> 01:42:14.153
LIAM: She could punch you through a wall.

2555
01:42:14.153 --> 01:42:15.704
Do you have a third room here?

2556
01:42:15.704 --> 01:42:18.845
SAM: We might need a man to take care of us, Fjord.

2557
01:42:18.845 --> 01:42:20.271
MATT: The bugbear that runs the Four Corners, if you go

2558
01:42:20.271 --> 01:42:24.021
and ask him, he's like no, "We're full, sorry."

2559
01:42:25.812 --> 01:42:27.482
LIAM: Fair play, fair play.

2560
01:42:27.482 --> 01:42:29.922
MARISHA: Unless-- do you want to room with the

2561
01:42:29.922 --> 01:42:32.983
ladies for any other particular reason?

2562
01:42:32.983 --> 01:42:33.941
SAM: Did you want to room with Jester

2563
01:42:33.941 --> 01:42:34.774
for any particular reason?

2564
01:42:34.774 --> 01:42:38.197
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll room with Caleb and Cad.

2565
01:42:38.197 --> 01:42:39.705
TALIESIN: I mean, if you think about it,

2566
01:42:39.705 --> 01:42:41.705
normally Yasha's the biggest one of us.

2567
01:42:41.705 --> 01:42:45.621
You've got the two of us here.

2568
01:42:45.621 --> 01:42:49.262
TRAVIS: I just head into one of the rooms.

2569
01:42:49.262 --> 01:42:50.768
MATT: Who joins Fjord?

2570
01:42:50.768 --> 01:42:53.171
LAURA: No, I go to the other one.

2571
01:42:53.171 --> 01:42:54.599
SAM: Don't you think he was subtlety--

2572
01:42:54.599 --> 01:42:57.599
LAURA: That isn't what he was doing, Nott!

2573
01:42:58.793 --> 01:43:01.603
MARISHA and SAM: I go in with Jester.

2574
01:43:01.603 --> 01:43:05.358
MATT: Okay, so ladies one. Yasha comes and joins you.

2575
01:43:06.734 --> 01:43:10.625
LIAM: I stand super indecisively for about eight minutes.

2576
01:43:10.625 --> 01:43:11.958
MATT: All right.

2577
01:43:14.617 --> 01:43:17.355
Who's taking a full rest on this, I guess?

2578
01:43:17.355 --> 01:43:19.394
MARISHA: How long will a full rest put me?

2579
01:43:19.394 --> 01:43:22.331
Am I meeting Dairon at sunset, or she said after dark.

2580
01:43:22.331 --> 01:43:24.735
MATT: She said after dark. You don't have a specific time.

2581
01:43:24.735 --> 01:43:26.001
By the time you guys have this space,

2582
01:43:26.001 --> 01:43:27.632
you've returned and you begin this rest,

2583
01:43:27.632 --> 01:43:30.077
it's closer to 4:00, 5:00 in the afternoon.

2584
01:43:30.077 --> 01:43:32.725
A full rest will put you conscious

2585
01:43:32.725 --> 01:43:36.069
at about 3:00, 4:00 in the morning.

2586
01:43:36.069 --> 01:43:41.011
MARISHA: I'm going to do a power nap

2587
01:43:41.011 --> 01:43:42.419
and blow some hit dice.

2588
01:43:42.419 --> 01:43:44.144
MATT: Okay, so you're going to go with a short rest.

2589
01:43:44.144 --> 01:43:45.938
MARISHA: I will head out early.

2590
01:43:45.938 --> 01:43:47.566
SAM: You're going to leave everybody behind?

2591
01:43:47.566 --> 01:43:48.993
LIAM: Yeah, she's got a one on one.

2592
01:43:48.993 --> 01:43:51.230
SAM: Oh, because you got to go to your meeting.

2593
01:43:51.230 --> 01:43:52.455
MARISHA: I've got class, dude.

2594
01:43:52.455 --> 01:43:53.800
LIAM: Since it's invisible and I can't see,

2595
01:43:53.800 --> 01:43:56.655
did anyone go into the cow stall with Fjord yet?

2596
01:43:56.655 --> 01:43:57.633
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, I did.

2597
01:43:57.633 --> 01:44:00.033
LIAM: You did? I'm going to join them.

2598
01:44:00.033 --> 01:44:02.839
MATT: Okay. You guys join each other.

2599
01:44:02.839 --> 01:44:06.756
Take your preparations for an early short rest.

2600
01:44:08.709 --> 01:44:11.273
As you spend your hit dice.

2601
01:44:11.273 --> 01:44:13.516
LIAM: Is the rest of the party doing

2602
01:44:13.516 --> 01:44:16.164
long rest until the middle of the night?

2603
01:44:16.164 --> 01:44:17.997
MATT: Everyone else is taking a long rest, apparently.

2604
01:44:17.997 --> 01:44:19.832
You'll be coming out at about

2605
01:44:19.832 --> 01:44:22.677
3:00 or 4:00 in the morning. So pushing dawn

2606
01:44:22.677 --> 01:44:25.993
depending on when you arrive at your destination.

2607
01:44:27.861 --> 01:44:29.902
LAURA: It would take two hours?

2608
01:44:29.902 --> 01:44:33.367
What, dawn is usually around 5:00 or 6:00 in the morning.

2609
01:44:33.367 --> 01:44:35.283
MATT: You haven't been in Xhorhas.

2610
01:44:35.283 --> 01:44:37.742
You wake up between 3:00 and 4:00, and you gather yourselves

2611
01:44:37.742 --> 01:44:39.045
and walk over to that part of town,

2612
01:44:39.045 --> 01:44:41.968
it's going to be 3:30, 4:30 in the morning.

2613
01:44:41.968 --> 01:44:43.763
The sun's not going to hit, but you'll

2614
01:44:43.763 --> 01:44:46.863
begin to see a change of light.

2615
01:44:46.863 --> 01:44:49.746
TALIESIN: I'm keeping that. That's nuts.

2616
01:44:51.670 --> 01:44:55.847
SAM: I've prepared my spells for the next day.

2617
01:44:55.847 --> 01:44:57.162
They're always the same spells.

2618
01:44:57.162 --> 01:44:58.226
MATT: Yeah, so good on you.

2619
01:44:58.226 --> 01:44:59.059
SAM: I'm ready.

2620
01:44:59.059 --> 01:44:59.892
MATT: You are prepared!

2621
01:44:59.892 --> 01:45:00.725
SAM: I am ready.

2622
01:45:00.725 --> 01:45:02.058
MATT: Well done, sir!

2623
01:45:05.057 --> 01:45:06.320
Everybody else good?

2624
01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:07.626
TALIESIN: I'm just picking spells.

2625
01:45:07.626 --> 01:45:09.378
We can start without that.

2626
01:45:09.378 --> 01:45:10.864
SAM: If I have any extra time, Matt,

2627
01:45:10.864 --> 01:45:15.848
I'm going to attempt to make a tracer arrow.

2628
01:45:17.492 --> 01:45:19.124
MATT: Unfortunately, you don't really

2629
01:45:19.124 --> 01:45:20.955
have a good space to do that here.

2630
01:45:20.955 --> 01:45:21.788
SAM: Great.

2631
01:45:21.788 --> 01:45:23.725
MATT: You're in a person stable.

2632
01:45:23.725 --> 01:45:26.006
SAM: I can't do explosive chemistry in a stall

2633
01:45:26.006 --> 01:45:28.122
with three other people right around me?

2634
01:45:28.122 --> 01:45:29.996
MATT: Unfortunately, I'm going to say no to that one.

2635
01:45:29.996 --> 01:45:31.466
SAM: Cool cool cool.

2636
01:45:31.466 --> 01:45:32.933
MATT: But keep an eye out.

2637
01:45:32.933 --> 01:45:35.990
TRAVIS: With a fair amount of nature manure around as well?

2638
01:45:35.990 --> 01:45:39.765
MATT: Yeah, it sounds like a great combination.

2639
01:45:39.765 --> 01:45:41.602
SAM: And dry hay.

2640
01:45:41.602 --> 01:45:43.030
MATT: Yeah. "What'd you roll?" "One."

2641
01:45:43.030 --> 01:45:46.454
Well, that's the fastest TPK we've ever had.

2642
01:45:46.454 --> 01:45:50.162
An unceremonious end to The Mighty Nein story.

2643
01:45:50.162 --> 01:45:53.945
Detonated by ignited feces.

2644
01:45:55.547 --> 01:45:57.627
MARISHA: Okay, I'm at full hit points.

2645
01:45:57.627 --> 01:45:58.811
MATT: Okay, Beau.

2646
01:45:58.811 --> 01:46:00.807
MARISHA: I'll take a little power nap.

2647
01:46:00.807 --> 01:46:02.356
A couple hours.

2648
01:46:02.356 --> 01:46:07.006
I'll head out like 45 minutes after sunset I guess,

2649
01:46:07.006 --> 01:46:09.775
once it's been dark for a little bit.

2650
01:46:09.775 --> 01:46:11.041
MATT: I'll say because everyone else

2651
01:46:11.041 --> 01:46:12.995
is also taking a long rest, your power nap

2652
01:46:12.995 --> 01:46:14.543
sends you to a point of consciousness

2653
01:46:14.543 --> 01:46:15.844
where you wake and it's dark and

2654
01:46:15.844 --> 01:46:16.985
you're not sure what time it is.

2655
01:46:16.985 --> 01:46:18.209
There's a brief bit of.

2656
01:46:18.209 --> 01:46:21.984
MARISHA: Fuck, fuck, fuck! Caleb, what time is it?

2657
01:46:21.984 --> 01:46:23.211
LIAM: I'm in the other stall.

2658
01:46:23.211 --> 01:46:24.378
MARISHA: Shit!

2659
01:46:26.226 --> 01:46:30.301
MATT: The other ladies are deep in their rests.

2660
01:46:30.301 --> 01:46:31.278
Light snoring.

2661
01:46:31.278 --> 01:46:33.069
SAM: (loud snoring)

2662
01:46:33.069 --> 01:46:34.402
TRAVIS: Light snoring.

2663
01:46:36.087 --> 01:46:37.306
MATT: "Light snoring"
MARISHA: Question.

2664
01:46:37.306 --> 01:46:38.139
MATT: Yes?

2665
01:46:39.100 --> 01:46:43.583
MARISHA: Where's Nott's glamor armor?

2666
01:46:43.583 --> 01:46:44.888
Where's your glamor armor?

2667
01:46:44.888 --> 01:46:45.944
MATT: On Nott, I think?

2668
01:46:45.944 --> 01:46:47.249
SAM: I don't know, do I sleep in armor?

2669
01:46:47.249 --> 01:46:49.452
MATT: Do you sleep in your armor?

2670
01:46:49.452 --> 01:46:50.348
SAM: Probably not.

2671
01:46:50.348 --> 01:46:52.059
MARISHA: Are you wearing that?

2672
01:46:52.059 --> 01:46:53.484
SAM: What's it made out of, leather?

2673
01:46:53.484 --> 01:46:54.500
MATT: It's made of leather, yeah.

2674
01:46:54.500 --> 01:46:56.944
SAM: Oh, then I'll sleep in it, yeah.

2675
01:46:56.944 --> 01:46:58.529
MATT: Nott's currently--

2676
01:46:58.529 --> 01:47:00.279
SAM: You can wake me up.

2677
01:47:01.625 --> 01:47:04.807
MARISHA: Do we have a hat? Do we have a disguise hat?

2678
01:47:04.807 --> 01:47:06.907
We don't have that? Was that old campaign?

2679
01:47:06.907 --> 01:47:07.965
TALIESIN: That was old campaign.

2680
01:47:07.965 --> 01:47:09.965
LIAM: New campaign, who dis?

2681
01:47:13.595 --> 01:47:14.775
MARISHA: Yeah, I wake up Nott.

2682
01:47:14.775 --> 01:47:15.753
SAM: Ahh!

2683
01:47:15.753 --> 01:47:18.753
MARISHA: (shushing) I'm sorry.

2684
01:47:20.993 --> 01:47:23.576
Can I borrow your glamor armor?

2685
01:47:24.784 --> 01:47:27.596
SAM: You want to wear my clothes?

2686
01:47:27.596 --> 01:47:28.429
MARISHA: Yeah.

2687
01:47:28.429 --> 01:47:30.012
SAM: What will I wear?

2688
01:47:31.348 --> 01:47:33.142
It's fine, yes, of course you can.

2689
01:47:33.142 --> 01:47:33.975
MARISHA: Really?

2690
01:47:33.975 --> 01:47:37.543
SAM: You're one of my closest allies and friends.

2691
01:47:37.543 --> 01:47:40.602
MARISHA: That is deeply kind of you.

2692
01:47:40.602 --> 01:47:43.904
SAM: Don't look at me while I change.

2693
01:47:43.904 --> 01:47:47.689
MARISHA: I want to try and blend in a little bit.

2694
01:47:47.689 --> 01:47:49.269
TRAVIS: Get the fuck out of here!

2695
01:47:49.269 --> 01:47:51.519
(laughter)

2696
01:47:52.923 --> 01:47:54.392
MATT: You do not need to attune to this.

2697
01:47:54.392 --> 01:47:55.711
You don't have to take an hour to attune which is nice.

2698
01:47:55.711 --> 01:47:56.619
MARISHA: Fuck yes.

2699
01:47:56.619 --> 01:47:58.469
LIAM: Although she does hand you armor the size

2700
01:47:58.469 --> 01:47:59.305
of Teddy Ruxpin.

2701
01:47:59.305 --> 01:48:01.680
MATT: Yeah. You take it and wonder what's going to happen

2702
01:48:01.680 --> 01:48:04.156
as you take a moment to try and squeeze into

2703
01:48:04.156 --> 01:48:05.949
one shoulder. You're like: This is not going to work.

2704
01:48:05.949 --> 01:48:08.884
You feel it expand a bit and loosen itself

2705
01:48:08.884 --> 01:48:12.351
and the plates shift to meet your frame.

2706
01:48:12.351 --> 01:48:13.684
MARISHA: How's it look?

2707
01:48:14.648 --> 01:48:16.357
SAM: I mean, it just looks the same.

2708
01:48:16.357 --> 01:48:20.357
You have to think what you want it to look like.

2709
01:48:21.264 --> 01:48:26.264
MARISHA: I copy that armor that, the Kryn armor.

2710
01:48:26.804 --> 01:48:29.335
The guard that I was just talking to.

2711
01:48:29.335 --> 01:48:30.759
It was a bugbear guard?

2712
01:48:30.759 --> 01:48:32.318
TRAVIS: No, it was a Kryn guard.

2713
01:48:32.318 --> 01:48:34.419
LIAM: That was Kryn with half armor.

2714
01:48:34.419 --> 01:48:37.502
MARISHA: It's got a hood and shit, right?

2715
01:48:38.539 --> 01:48:41.061
MATT: The leather armor does not have a hood.

2716
01:48:41.061 --> 01:48:43.020
So you're still visually...

2717
01:48:43.020 --> 01:48:44.729
MARISHA: I'll put my cloak hood up.

2718
01:48:44.729 --> 01:48:46.605
MATT: Okay, but you give yourself the visual

2719
01:48:46.605 --> 01:48:50.646
perspective of the chitinous armor of the Kryn soldiers.

2720
01:48:50.646 --> 01:48:52.152
All right.

2721
01:48:52.152 --> 01:48:53.255
MARISHA: You're the best.

2722
01:48:53.255 --> 01:48:55.297
SAM: I know.

2723
01:48:55.297 --> 01:48:57.914
Good luck out there. Having fun training.

2724
01:48:57.914 --> 01:48:59.536
MARISHA: I'll meet you guys at the well.

2725
01:48:59.536 --> 01:49:00.369
SAM: Cool.

2726
01:49:01.944 --> 01:49:04.225
MATT: You step out and you get a few feet

2727
01:49:04.225 --> 01:49:09.217
from the back entrance to the pens here

2728
01:49:09.217 --> 01:49:12.295
outside of the Four Corners.

2729
01:49:12.295 --> 01:49:14.503
Before a voice goes, "Psst."

2730
01:49:15.719 --> 01:49:17.224
You glance over and you can see

2731
01:49:17.224 --> 01:49:21.670
Dairon in her drow visage.

2732
01:49:21.670 --> 01:49:23.583
Arms crossed.

2733
01:49:23.583 --> 01:49:26.072
"That took you some time, didn't it?"

2734
01:49:26.072 --> 01:49:28.997
MARISHA: I wanted to make sure it was super dark.

2735
01:49:28.997 --> 01:49:29.893
MATT: "Follow me."

2736
01:49:29.893 --> 01:49:33.176
MARISHA: All right. And I trail behind her a little bit.

2737
01:49:33.176 --> 01:49:36.047
MATT: One by one, she leads you for about 15 minutes

2738
01:49:36.047 --> 01:49:39.423
away from where you guys were sleeping.

2739
01:49:39.423 --> 01:49:44.206
Until eventually you come to some large storage bin

2740
01:49:44.206 --> 01:49:47.451
of some kind, or a storage facility.

2741
01:49:47.451 --> 01:49:51.488
It has one sliding door that is partially ajar.

2742
01:49:51.488 --> 01:49:53.200
As soon as you approach the slight crack, you can

2743
01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:57.200
already smell this heavy heavy scent of tobacco.

2744
01:49:58.903 --> 01:50:03.895
As you come and enter, you can see a lot of thick, tar-like

2745
01:50:03.895 --> 01:50:07.015
tobacco plants that are currently being stored here,

2746
01:50:07.015 --> 01:50:10.398
and this black tar material that seems

2747
01:50:10.398 --> 01:50:13.414
to have been long dried against a lot of

2748
01:50:13.414 --> 01:50:17.285
the wood of the inside of this facility.

2749
01:50:17.285 --> 01:50:20.058
It's maybe 20 foot by 30 feet, this space here,

2750
01:50:20.058 --> 01:50:21.931
and half of it is filled with crates

2751
01:50:21.931 --> 01:50:24.292
and other things seem to contain this.

2752
01:50:24.292 --> 01:50:26.412
As you enter and look around you hear,

2753
01:50:26.412 --> 01:50:29.754
(sliding) as it closes behind you.

2754
01:50:29.754 --> 01:50:32.862
It is dark inside there. No light.

2755
01:50:32.862 --> 01:50:33.748
MARISHA: Goggles.

2756
01:50:33.748 --> 01:50:35.257
MATT: You put the goggles on.

2757
01:50:35.257 --> 01:50:36.682
As soon as you put the googles on,

2758
01:50:36.682 --> 01:50:38.680
in the darkness you can see Dairon's form

2759
01:50:38.680 --> 01:50:41.041
behind you as you turn around to look and she goes,

2760
01:50:41.041 --> 01:50:45.268
"That is good. That helps take care of one weakness."

2761
01:50:45.268 --> 01:50:46.101
MARISHA: Okay.

2762
01:50:49.758 --> 01:50:52.436
TRAVIS: Good comeback, good.

2763
01:50:52.436 --> 01:50:55.753
MATT: She approaches and says, "So I have taught you

2764
01:50:55.753 --> 01:50:59.999
some techniques, and I see there is

2765
01:50:59.999 --> 01:51:01.924
still some teaching to be done.

2766
01:51:02.764 --> 01:51:04.720
You have jumped ahead in some ways

2767
01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:06.593
when you were not ready, and there are

2768
01:51:06.593 --> 01:51:10.669
some things you skipped along the process.

2769
01:51:10.669 --> 01:51:15.453
For one, show me what you can learn from me.

2770
01:51:18.255 --> 01:51:19.396
MARISHA: Flurry of Blows.

2771
01:51:19.396 --> 01:51:21.062
MATT: Go for it. Attack rolls.

2772
01:51:21.062 --> 01:51:22.312
TRAVIS: Come on, girl.

2773
01:51:24.058 --> 01:51:26.670
MARISHA: First one, then second one.

2774
01:51:26.670 --> 01:51:30.011
First one's a four, second one's a natural 19.

2775
01:51:30.011 --> 01:51:31.352
MATT: First one she slaps away,

2776
01:51:31.352 --> 01:51:34.532
the second attack catches her in the chin.

2777
01:51:34.532 --> 01:51:35.878
Those are your two attacks, and then

2778
01:51:35.878 --> 01:51:38.325
you have your two bonus action attacks.

2779
01:51:38.325 --> 01:51:40.649
MARISHA: Oh, I thought I was starting with Flurry of Blows.

2780
01:51:40.649 --> 01:51:41.750
MATT: Well, you have to do attack action,

2781
01:51:41.750 --> 01:51:43.135
then Flurry of bBows is how it works.

2782
01:51:43.135 --> 01:51:44.440
MARISHA: Then Flurry of Blows, okay.

2783
01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:46.026
MATT: You open up with two strikes, and then go

2784
01:51:46.026 --> 01:51:47.939
into the Flurry of Blows as the bonus action.

2785
01:51:47.939 --> 01:51:48.772
MARISHA: Okay.

2786
01:51:48.772 --> 01:51:51.035
MATT: You can roll damage for that first one.

2787
01:51:51.035 --> 01:51:52.265
MARISHA: Shit, shit, shit.

2788
01:51:52.265 --> 01:51:53.687
TRAVIS: You're good.

2789
01:51:53.687 --> 01:51:55.887
MARISHA: Why, why? Six damage.

2790
01:51:56.865 --> 01:51:59.026
Pulling my punches.

2791
01:51:59.026 --> 01:52:01.878
MATT: Go for it, then follow up with your bonus action.

2792
01:52:01.878 --> 01:52:05.304
Do your two more unarmed strikes.

2793
01:52:05.304 --> 01:52:06.137
Go for it.

2794
01:52:08.644 --> 01:52:10.477
MARISHA: Damn it, Gil.

2795
01:52:14.268 --> 01:52:15.101
18.

2796
01:52:16.834 --> 01:52:18.872
For the first one, and 17 for the other one.

2797
01:52:18.872 --> 01:52:20.334
MATT: 17 misses, 18 does hit.

2798
01:52:20.334 --> 01:52:24.100
MARISHA: Ooh. And I Extract Aspects.

2799
01:52:25.063 --> 01:52:27.813
MATT: What are you choosing to learn?

2800
01:52:28.941 --> 01:52:30.810
MARISHA: Her constitution.

2801
01:52:30.810 --> 01:52:31.643
MATT: Okay.

2802
01:52:32.641 --> 01:52:35.498
With that, you learn...

2803
01:52:35.498 --> 01:52:37.861
Dairon has a constitution modifier plus two.

2804
01:52:37.861 --> 01:52:40.355
MARISHA: Stunning strike.

2805
01:52:40.355 --> 01:52:41.671
That last one.

2806
01:52:41.671 --> 01:52:42.504
MATT: Okay.

2807
01:52:44.097 --> 01:52:47.264
MARISHA: Crack crack, roundhouse to the face.

2808
01:52:49.151 --> 01:52:50.484
MATT: (groan) She just stands there,

2809
01:52:50.484 --> 01:52:51.325
unable to move in the moment.

2810
01:52:51.325 --> 01:52:53.616
TRAVIS: Yeah, good pop!

2811
01:52:53.616 --> 01:52:56.929
MARISHA: I tell her: Looks like the diet out here

2812
01:52:56.929 --> 01:53:00.231
has been messing with your system a little bit.

2813
01:53:00.231 --> 01:53:01.579
Not feeling as hearty as you

2814
01:53:01.579 --> 01:53:04.162
normally do back in the Empire?

2815
01:53:05.096 --> 01:53:06.972
MATT: She shrugs off the stun after a moment,

2816
01:53:06.972 --> 01:53:11.095
looks back and goes, "Your attacks are still unfocused.

2817
01:53:11.095 --> 01:53:13.296
"You try and reach too broadly.

2818
01:53:13.296 --> 01:53:18.296
"Instead, try and learn the important things all at once.

2819
01:53:20.065 --> 01:53:20.898
"Like this."

2820
01:53:20.898 --> 01:53:24.387
She goes in for a series of strikes against you.

2821
01:53:24.387 --> 01:53:26.142
That is 24 to hit?

2822
01:53:26.142 --> 01:53:27.323
MARISHA: Hits.

2823
01:53:27.323 --> 01:53:29.525
MATT: That is 11 to hit.

2824
01:53:29.525 --> 01:53:30.787
MARISHA: Hits.

2825
01:53:30.787 --> 01:53:31.620
MATT: 11 hits?

2826
01:53:31.620 --> 01:53:33.020
MARISHA: No sorry, misses. Sorry!

2827
01:53:33.020 --> 01:53:35.373
(stammering) I'm just scared!

2828
01:53:35.373 --> 01:53:36.906
TRAVIS: It all hits!

2829
01:53:36.906 --> 01:53:38.205
LAURA: I'm terrified! Everything hits!

2830
01:53:38.205 --> 01:53:39.139
LIAM: It hurts to feel so good!

2831
01:53:39.139 --> 01:53:41.259
MATT: First strike, that's going to be

2832
01:53:41.259 --> 01:53:43.337
12 points of bludgeoning damage.

2833
01:53:43.337 --> 01:53:45.332
As you take one hit to the sternum,

2834
01:53:45.332 --> 01:53:46.675
and you hear the bones crack

2835
01:53:46.675 --> 01:53:48.181
inward from the impact, the wind

2836
01:53:48.181 --> 01:53:50.831
temporarily knocked out of you.

2837
01:53:50.831 --> 01:53:52.417
You're blown back, and her next swing

2838
01:53:52.417 --> 01:53:54.457
with her other fist goes towards

2839
01:53:54.457 --> 01:53:56.132
your face and the momentum that forced

2840
01:53:56.132 --> 01:53:58.004
you backwards, you lean into it,

2841
01:53:58.004 --> 01:53:59.430
and like a reed in the wind, you bend

2842
01:53:59.430 --> 01:54:01.142
out of the way and the fist just archs

2843
01:54:01.142 --> 01:54:03.055
past the front of your face, just guiding

2844
01:54:03.055 --> 01:54:05.334
past the front of your nose.

2845
01:54:05.334 --> 01:54:07.333
Goes into her Flurry of Blows as well.

2846
01:54:07.333 --> 01:54:08.759
That's going to be a 23 to hit.

2847
01:54:08.759 --> 01:54:09.592
MARISHA: Hits.

2848
01:54:09.592 --> 01:54:10.814
MATT: And a 25 to hit.

2849
01:54:10.814 --> 01:54:11.790
MARISHA: Hits.

2850
01:54:11.790 --> 01:54:12.623
TRAVIS: Fuck.

2851
01:54:12.623 --> 01:54:15.744
MATT: You take five points of bludgeoning damage.

2852
01:54:15.744 --> 01:54:19.377
And ten points of bludgeoning damage.

2853
01:54:21.041 --> 01:54:23.537
With these strikes, one goes and strikes

2854
01:54:23.537 --> 01:54:24.924
not the sternum, but just below it

2855
01:54:24.924 --> 01:54:26.800
where the ribcage ends and seems to

2856
01:54:26.800 --> 01:54:29.080
hook underneath where the bone is,

2857
01:54:29.080 --> 01:54:30.997
so it's actually grabbing you up

2858
01:54:30.997 --> 01:54:33.237
in the ribcage and pulls you forward.

2859
01:54:33.237 --> 01:54:36.255
The pain is sharp and immense, as you come forward

2860
01:54:36.255 --> 01:54:38.784
the other fingers hit you up underneath

2861
01:54:38.784 --> 01:54:41.560
the chin and grasp inward as a hook as well.

2862
01:54:41.560 --> 01:54:45.107
A moment after that you can feel your heartbeat.

2863
01:54:45.107 --> 01:54:46.832
(heart beating)

2864
01:54:46.832 --> 01:54:51.440
The blood from your jugular hitting her fingers.

2865
01:54:51.440 --> 01:54:54.092
You watch as she focuses. There's

2866
01:54:54.092 --> 01:54:57.067
an interesting expression: as opposed to

2867
01:54:57.067 --> 01:55:00.327
visualizing the anatomy, her eyes are

2868
01:55:00.327 --> 01:55:02.857
somewhat half-closed and unfocused.

2869
01:55:02.857 --> 01:55:05.912
You know when you use ki, when you focus

2870
01:55:05.912 --> 01:55:07.951
on your spiritual energy to harness

2871
01:55:07.951 --> 01:55:10.191
your combat prowess, there is a

2872
01:55:10.191 --> 01:55:13.108
communion between your ki and hers.

2873
01:55:14.303 --> 01:55:17.518
It's an invasive, and you feel this force

2874
01:55:17.518 --> 01:55:20.172
come into you from the impact at the chin

2875
01:55:20.172 --> 01:55:22.331
and then extrude back into her

2876
01:55:22.331 --> 01:55:24.487
fingers and she pulls away.

2877
01:55:24.487 --> 01:55:28.070
MARISHA: That's my personal space, personal space!

2878
01:55:28.933 --> 01:55:32.801
MATT: "So that is one thing I would like to show you to do."

2879
01:55:32.801 --> 01:55:34.301
MARISHA: What did you do?

2880
01:55:35.819 --> 01:55:39.447
MATT: "I learned the bulk of the important things."

2881
01:55:39.447 --> 01:55:41.115
Over the next few minutes she begins

2882
01:55:41.115 --> 01:55:44.613
to show you the proper points to apply this pressure.

2883
01:55:44.613 --> 01:55:45.910
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

2884
01:55:45.910 --> 01:55:49.294
MATT: This alters your Extracting Aspects a bit.

2885
01:55:49.294 --> 01:55:53.248
This goes into a series of sparring matches

2886
01:55:53.248 --> 01:55:56.386
as well where she shows you that being

2887
01:55:56.386 --> 01:55:58.509
reactive is important, but perhaps

2888
01:55:58.509 --> 01:56:00.343
not as important in your current training.

2889
01:56:00.343 --> 01:56:03.525
As far as being prepared for immediately

2890
01:56:03.525 --> 01:56:07.075
dealing with a scenario, and for your

2891
01:56:07.075 --> 01:56:10.009
current purpose of your mission,

2892
01:56:10.009 --> 01:56:12.047
is instead to find that moment of weakness

2893
01:56:12.047 --> 01:56:16.165
in an opponent and retaliate as quickly as possible.

2894
01:56:16.165 --> 01:56:19.537
As part of this training, we have

2895
01:56:19.537 --> 01:56:22.938
new updates to the Way of the Cobalt Soul for you.

2896
01:56:22.938 --> 01:56:25.927
MARISHA and SAM: Class updates!

2897
01:56:25.927 --> 01:56:28.748
MATT: It is a homebrew of mine that I've been

2898
01:56:28.748 --> 01:56:30.257
toying with in the game here,

2899
01:56:30.257 --> 01:56:31.928
getting community feedback for a while.

2900
01:56:31.928 --> 01:56:36.047
Now we have an opportunity for you to adjust a few things.

2901
01:56:36.047 --> 01:56:39.102
As part of this, your Extract Aspects,

2902
01:56:39.102 --> 01:56:41.953
as opposed to choosing, whenever you hit

2903
01:56:41.953 --> 01:56:44.605
a creature with one of your Flurry of Blows,

2904
01:56:44.605 --> 01:56:47.742
you learn what conditions they're immune to,

2905
01:56:47.742 --> 01:56:49.735
what damages they're immune to,

2906
01:56:49.735 --> 01:56:51.041
what damages they're resistant to,

2907
01:56:51.041 --> 01:56:52.508
and what damages they're vulnerable to.

2908
01:56:52.508 --> 01:56:55.213
MARIHSA: So I don't pick, just all at once.

2909
01:56:55.213 --> 01:56:56.289
MATT: You learn those.

2910
01:56:56.289 --> 01:56:58.081
You lose some of the broader choices,

2911
01:56:58.081 --> 01:57:00.405
but those you just learn automatically

2912
01:57:00.405 --> 01:57:02.237
as they are generally important

2913
01:57:02.237 --> 01:57:05.541
as opposed to having to pick and choose.

2914
01:57:05.541 --> 01:57:06.969
Either you learn immediately that none of these

2915
01:57:06.969 --> 01:57:08.269
are important, or at least you learn

2916
01:57:08.269 --> 01:57:09.494
some information that might help you

2917
01:57:09.494 --> 01:57:10.718
tactically in the battlefield.

2918
01:57:10.718 --> 01:57:12.841
You still have to convey that to your party

2919
01:57:12.841 --> 01:57:15.993
once learned, but that can be useful at times.

2920
01:57:15.993 --> 01:57:16.993
Testing out this variation--

2921
01:57:16.993 --> 01:57:20.334
TRAVIS: Their immune to this and they're weak against this.

2922
01:57:20.334 --> 01:57:21.751
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2923
01:57:23.474 --> 01:57:28.474
MATT: Also swapping the arrival of two of the abilities.

2924
01:57:28.734 --> 01:57:30.687
The Preternatural Counter and the

2925
01:57:30.687 --> 01:57:34.354
Might of Mercury are swapped.

2926
01:57:34.354 --> 01:57:36.393
You currently do not have the ability to gain

2927
01:57:36.393 --> 01:57:41.042
additional reactions by spending ki points.

2928
01:57:41.042 --> 01:57:42.430
That's changed a bit now, you can't

2929
01:57:42.430 --> 01:57:44.713
spend multiple on a turn, once per turn

2930
01:57:44.713 --> 01:57:46.468
and eventually when you get this ability,

2931
01:57:46.468 --> 01:57:47.567
once per turn you can spend a ki point

2932
01:57:47.567 --> 01:57:50.176
to get an additional reaction.

2933
01:57:50.176 --> 01:57:51.278
MARISHA: This allows me--

2934
01:57:51.278 --> 01:57:53.233
MATT: What you have now is Preternatural Counter.

2935
01:57:53.233 --> 01:57:54.579
Which is whenever an enemy misses you with

2936
01:57:54.579 --> 01:57:56.985
an attack in melee, you can use your reaction

2937
01:57:56.985 --> 01:58:00.326
to make an unarmed strike back at them.

2938
01:58:00.326 --> 01:58:01.409
SAM: Every time?

2939
01:58:02.913 --> 01:58:04.426
MATT: One reaction per turn.

2940
01:58:04.426 --> 01:58:06.343
SAM: One reaction, got it.

2941
01:58:08.828 --> 01:58:11.968
MATT: As part of this training, you do suffer an

2942
01:58:11.968 --> 01:58:16.712
additional 12 points of bludgeoning damage.

2943
01:58:16.712 --> 01:58:18.879
When all is said and done.

2944
01:58:19.875 --> 01:58:22.969
When this training is complete,

2945
01:58:22.969 --> 01:58:25.253
both you and Dairon are sweating

2946
01:58:25.253 --> 01:58:28.086
in the dark here in the warehouse.

2947
01:58:29.369 --> 01:58:32.343
You're exhausted and sore, but also happy

2948
01:58:32.343 --> 01:58:34.869
to know that you feel a little more

2949
01:58:34.869 --> 01:58:36.947
confident in your abilities to defend yourself

2950
01:58:36.947 --> 01:58:41.914
and both learn the important aspects

2951
01:58:41.914 --> 01:58:45.361
of some of your enemies in the battlefield,

2952
01:58:45.361 --> 01:58:48.672
as well as utilize their failures to your advantage.

2953
01:58:48.672 --> 01:58:50.194
Being able to read their movements,

2954
01:58:50.194 --> 01:58:54.086
and in that instant be able to avoid

2955
01:58:54.086 --> 01:58:57.444
that burst of conflict, and then reciprocate

2956
01:58:57.444 --> 01:59:00.474
with your own act of aggression.

2957
01:59:00.474 --> 01:59:02.185
Dairon looks up to you after a few rounds

2958
01:59:02.185 --> 01:59:03.857
of this, about a good hour or so

2959
01:59:03.857 --> 01:59:08.852
of this conflict, and goes, "I am very impressed

2960
01:59:08.852 --> 01:59:11.475
"with how fast you were able to pick this up.

2961
01:59:11.475 --> 01:59:14.808
"I knew that my eye on you is not wasted."

2962
01:59:16.001 --> 01:59:17.539
MARISHA: Your what, your aura?

2963
01:59:17.539 --> 01:59:18.448
MATT: "My eye on you."

2964
01:59:18.448 --> 01:59:20.956
MARISHA: Oh, your eye. Sorry.

2965
01:59:20.956 --> 01:59:23.822
Sorry, you hit me in the head. My ears were ringing.

2966
01:59:23.822 --> 01:59:25.490
MATT: "I told you to listen specifically."

2967
01:59:25.490 --> 01:59:28.668
MARISHA: I'm sorry. Christ, I'm a little dazed.

2968
01:59:28.668 --> 01:59:31.437
LIAM: I owe you another martial arts lesson.

2969
01:59:31.437 --> 01:59:35.387
MARISHA: Okay, well I'm going to take a few minutes and then

2970
01:59:35.387 --> 01:59:39.297
I'm going to go climb down a well with my friends.

2971
01:59:39.297 --> 01:59:40.203
MATT: "What?"

2972
01:59:40.203 --> 01:59:44.071
(laughter)

2973
01:59:44.071 --> 01:59:46.352
MARISHA: We bought these moorbounders from this

2974
01:59:46.352 --> 01:59:49.891
armless goblin guy, and there was a rift--

2975
01:59:49.891 --> 01:59:50.816
MATT: "Beauregard.

2976
01:59:52.794 --> 01:59:54.547
"Don't die.

2977
01:59:54.547 --> 01:59:56.605
"Listen, be patient.

2978
01:59:57.891 --> 01:59:59.016
"Be careful.

2979
02:00:02.126 --> 02:00:06.449
"If we're lucky, I'll see you on the other side."

2980
02:00:06.449 --> 02:00:07.793
She walks past, pats you on

2981
02:00:07.793 --> 02:00:09.588
the shoulder, and then steps out of the way.

2982
02:00:09.588 --> 02:00:12.191
MARISHA: How might I find you in Ghor Dranas?

2983
02:00:12.191 --> 02:00:13.983
MATT: "You told me your friends can contact me.

2984
02:00:13.983 --> 02:00:15.820
"They already have before.

2985
02:00:15.820 --> 02:00:17.940
"Just keep that friend alive."

2986
02:00:17.940 --> 02:00:20.357
MARISHA: I want to give you something.

2987
02:00:22.259 --> 02:00:25.926
I pull out a written copy--
LAURA: My vagina.

2988
02:00:30.583 --> 02:00:32.550
LIAM: Laura Bailey!

2989
02:00:32.550 --> 02:00:33.653
SAM: She's a child.

2990
02:00:33.653 --> 02:00:34.486
LIAM: Laura Bailey!

2991
02:00:34.486 --> 02:00:35.469
TALIESIN: We were all there.

2992
02:00:36.957 --> 02:00:38.290
MARISHA: -- of the cipher.

2993
02:00:42.383 --> 02:00:44.716
I know how to write in this.

2994
02:00:46.867 --> 02:00:49.028
There's instructions on how to

2995
02:00:49.028 --> 02:00:51.861
write in it and how to read in it.

2996
02:00:53.149 --> 02:00:57.482
If there's ever information, we need to communicate

2997
02:00:59.224 --> 02:01:02.891
under the radar, you can write me with that.

2998
02:01:05.011 --> 02:01:06.767
MATT: "Impressive.

2999
02:01:06.767 --> 02:01:08.925
"I will look over this in my travels,

3000
02:01:08.925 --> 02:01:13.202
"I'm certain to have time in the weeks to come.

3001
02:01:13.202 --> 02:01:14.035
"Thank you.

3002
02:01:15.400 --> 02:01:16.983
"Now what did I say?"

3003
02:01:19.038 --> 02:01:20.589
MARISHA: Stay alive.

3004
02:01:20.589 --> 02:01:21.975
MATT: "And?"

3005
02:01:21.975 --> 02:01:23.036
MARISHA: Listen.

3006
02:01:23.036 --> 02:01:23.869
MATT: "And?"

3007
02:01:24.872 --> 02:01:26.605
MARISHA: Trust no one.

3008
02:01:26.605 --> 02:01:27.438
MATT: "Eh..."

3009
02:01:27.438 --> 02:01:29.148
I gambled on that last one.

3010
02:01:29.148 --> 02:01:30.654
You've said a lot of things.

3011
02:01:30.654 --> 02:01:31.633
MATT: "Be patient."

3012
02:01:31.633 --> 02:01:35.296
MARISHA: Oh patient, right, be patient.

3013
02:01:35.296 --> 02:01:38.106
Be patient, listen, stay alive.

3014
02:01:38.106 --> 02:01:40.312
Patient, listen, stay alive, got it.

3015
02:01:40.312 --> 02:01:42.024
MATT: "Don't disappoint me."

3016
02:01:42.024 --> 02:01:42.857
MARISHA: Okay.

3017
02:01:43.739 --> 02:01:46.229
MATT: Then with that final push, exits out

3018
02:01:46.229 --> 02:01:51.162
and vanishes into the night air of Asarius.

3019
02:01:53.429 --> 02:01:58.331
MARISHA: (heavy breathing) And I spend more-- no, wait.

3020
02:01:58.331 --> 02:02:01.063
You have to rest to spend the hit dice.

3021
02:02:01.063 --> 02:02:01.896
MATT: Yeah.

3022
02:02:02.899 --> 02:02:05.232
You can go back and do that.

3023
02:02:06.293 --> 02:02:09.461
MARISHA: Do I know if they'd still be asleep?

3024
02:02:09.461 --> 02:02:10.888
MATT: I mean, you can make a nature check

3025
02:02:10.888 --> 02:02:12.569
to try and-- or this would be survival.

3026
02:02:12.569 --> 02:02:14.242
Make a survival check to gauge

3027
02:02:14.242 --> 02:02:16.807
the point of the evening it may be.

3028
02:02:16.807 --> 02:02:17.724
MARISHA: Survival.

3029
02:02:18.839 --> 02:02:19.981
19.

3030
02:02:19.981 --> 02:02:21.286
MATT: 19.

3031
02:02:21.286 --> 02:02:24.606
You gather it's a little bit past midnight at this time.

3032
02:02:24.606 --> 02:02:26.233
MARISHA: Okay.

3033
02:02:26.233 --> 02:02:27.576
MATT: There are a few more hours before

3034
02:02:27.576 --> 02:02:29.327
your friends will probably be waking.

3035
02:02:29.327 --> 02:02:33.594
However, you are losing a long rest

3036
02:02:33.594 --> 02:02:35.440
in doing this, and it might come

3037
02:02:35.440 --> 02:02:37.191
to the point of possibly gaining

3038
02:02:37.191 --> 02:02:40.002
a point of exhaustion, so just be aware.

3039
02:02:40.002 --> 02:02:41.673
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

3040
02:02:41.673 --> 02:02:43.915
Well, I'm going to go back and I'm going to take

3041
02:02:43.915 --> 02:02:46.396
another short rest. I'm going to crawl back in.

3042
02:02:46.396 --> 02:02:48.615
MATT: Make a stealth check for me.

3043
02:02:48.615 --> 02:02:52.324
MARISHA: And I keep my eye open on the way.

3044
02:02:52.324 --> 02:02:55.015
Not great, but could be worse.

3045
02:02:55.015 --> 02:02:56.318
13.

3046
02:02:56.318 --> 02:02:57.785
MATT: 13, okay.

3047
02:02:57.785 --> 02:03:00.350
With the armor that you have,

3048
02:03:00.350 --> 02:03:02.999
no one seems to bother you with that roll.

3049
02:03:02.999 --> 02:03:05.241
You make your way back towards the pens

3050
02:03:05.241 --> 02:03:08.782
outside of the Four Corners, stealthily glide

3051
02:03:08.782 --> 02:03:11.025
into one of the two chambers where

3052
02:03:11.025 --> 02:03:12.697
the ladies are previously sleeping and allow

3053
02:03:12.697 --> 02:03:16.367
yourself to take a short rest in silent peace.

3054
02:03:16.367 --> 02:03:17.854
MARISHA: And I meditate.

3055
02:03:17.854 --> 02:03:19.482
LAURA: You're in there and you're awake,

3056
02:03:19.482 --> 02:03:21.272
so you could wake us up and make sure we wake up

3057
02:03:21.272 --> 02:03:23.760
on the earlier side of it than the later side.

3058
02:03:23.760 --> 02:03:25.716
MARISHA: I could, yeah.

3059
02:03:25.716 --> 02:03:28.082
MATT: As the rest of you complete your short rest,

3060
02:03:28.082 --> 02:03:31.097
you slowly begin to rouse to consciousness,

3061
02:03:31.097 --> 02:03:35.348
to the dark, early early morning.

3062
02:03:35.348 --> 02:03:37.756
It is freezing; there's frost on the

3063
02:03:37.756 --> 02:03:39.749
edges of the wood that surround you.

3064
02:03:39.749 --> 02:03:40.935
LAURA: Feels so good.

3065
02:03:40.935 --> 02:03:43.582
MATT: As you come to gather your bearings

3066
02:03:43.582 --> 02:03:46.584
for whatever the rest of this cold, frozen

3067
02:03:46.584 --> 02:03:51.054
dew morning brings, we're going to take a break.

3068
02:03:51.054 --> 02:03:53.577
We'll be back here in a few moments.

3069
02:03:53.577 --> 02:03:55.454
We do have our giveaway tonight.

3070
02:03:55.454 --> 02:03:57.534
Over at fantastic Wyrmwood.

3071
02:03:57.534 --> 02:03:58.757
SAM: Which one?

3072
02:03:58.757 --> 02:04:00.382
Which one is it, which one is it?

3073
02:04:00.382 --> 02:04:03.604
MATT: This is the Spalted Tamarind.

3074
02:04:03.604 --> 02:04:05.070
Our friends at Wyrmwood did this.

3075
02:04:05.070 --> 02:04:07.355
It's a Spalted Tamarind dice tray,

3076
02:04:07.355 --> 02:04:09.252
made out of very high quality spalted tamarind wood

3077
02:04:09.252 --> 02:04:12.433
with a leather flooring on this.

3078
02:04:12.433 --> 02:04:14.552
This will go to one lucky winner when we return.

3079
02:04:14.552 --> 02:04:17.244
The codeword for tonight is spy.

3080
02:04:17.244 --> 02:04:18.913
S-P-Y.

3081
02:04:18.913 --> 02:04:20.420
Here in the Critical Role Twitch chat,

3082
02:04:20.420 --> 02:04:21.925
enter the word spy once.

3083
02:04:21.925 --> 02:04:23.637
More than once and you will be disqualified.

3084
02:04:23.637 --> 02:04:25.183
Once again, it's only for our friends

3085
02:04:25.183 --> 02:04:26.649
in the US and Canada, excluding Quebec

3086
02:04:26.649 --> 02:04:28.525
because of stupid giveaway laws,

3087
02:04:28.525 --> 02:04:31.420
but we're returning shortly with a winner.

3088
02:04:31.420 --> 02:04:32.561
See you guys in a minute.

3089
02:04:32.561 --> 02:04:34.314
LIAM: That Tamarind is so spalted.

3090
02:04:34.314 --> 02:04:37.064
MATT: It's so spalted man, oh my god.

SAM: Hey Travis. Make a cartoon.

3110
02:05:29.544 --> 02:05:31.094
LIAM: I mean, with the success of the comic book,

3111
02:05:31.094 --> 02:05:32.689
a cartoon is a no brainer.

3112
02:05:32.689 --> 02:05:35.219
MARIHSA: Imagine my face, but animated.

3113
02:05:35.219 --> 02:05:36.052
SAM: Animation.

3114
02:05:36.052 --> 02:05:38.516
LAURA: Travis, the football game's on. You want a beer?

3115
02:05:38.516 --> 02:05:39.349
SAM: I want to voice Grog!

3116
02:05:39.349 --> 02:05:42.205
MATT: Want to write some scripts? For a cartoon?

3117
02:05:42.205 --> 02:05:43.205
SAM: Animation!

3118
02:05:44.069 --> 02:05:49.009
TRAVIS: (gasps)
[High-Pitched Tone]

3119
02:05:49.009 --> 02:05:51.002
LAURA: What's wrong, honey?

3120
02:05:51.002 --> 02:05:52.632
TRAVIS: I had a dream that Critical Role

3121
02:05:52.632 --> 02:05:56.232
is making an animated special.

3122
02:05:58.054 --> 02:05:59.436
TALIESIN: Go back to sleep.

3123
02:05:59.436 --> 02:06:01.839
We'll talk about it in the morning.

3124
02:06:01.839 --> 02:06:06.404
TRAVIS: No. Now! Rise and shine everyone!

3125
02:06:06.404 --> 02:06:08.129
(groaning)

3126
02:06:08.129 --> 02:06:08.962
MARISHA: Why would you do that?

3127
02:06:10.495 --> 02:06:12.918
MATT: All right. Come on, let's go.

3128
02:06:12.918 --> 02:06:16.051
(dramatic tribal drumming)

3129
02:06:17.200 --> 02:06:19.612
MATT: Hey world, we are Critical Role.

3130
02:06:19.612 --> 02:06:20.998
A bunch of nerdy ass voice actors.

3131
02:06:20.998 --> 02:06:22.746
SAM: And today we are thrilled to announce

3132
02:06:22.746 --> 02:06:26.533
our 45 day campaign for a Critical Role (gasps)

3133
02:06:26.533 --> 02:06:27.950
animated special!

3134
02:06:28.815 --> 02:06:30.482
MATT: Now that has been highly requested,

3135
02:06:30.482 --> 02:06:31.906
and believe me, for five years, it's been

3136
02:06:31.906 --> 02:06:34.190
our dream to tell these stories in animation.

3137
02:06:34.190 --> 02:06:36.150
Now with your support, we're going to

3138
02:06:36.150 --> 02:06:38.105
make that dream a reality and fund

3139
02:06:38.105 --> 02:06:40.714
a fully animated half hour special starring

3140
02:06:40.714 --> 02:06:43.448
the original characters from our first campaign.

3141
02:06:43.448 --> 02:06:47.239
TRAVIS: Yeah, we are calling it The Legend of Vox Machina.

3142
02:06:47.239 --> 02:06:48.970
LAURA: Oh my gosh. But why wait?

3143
02:06:48.970 --> 02:06:50.094
Let's just show them the animated

3144
02:06:50.094 --> 02:06:52.860
teaser we've been working on. Roll that clip!

3145
02:06:52.860 --> 02:06:54.334
LAURA: Whoa, no no no, uh-uh!

3146
02:06:54.334 --> 02:06:55.311
Hold your horses okay?

3147
02:06:55.311 --> 02:06:56.977
SAM: Why? What's wrong?

3148
02:06:56.977 --> 02:06:58.288
TRAVIS: No, I mean, some folks might

3149
02:06:58.288 --> 02:07:00.810
not know, ow, who the hell we are.

3150
02:07:00.810 --> 02:07:02.645
LIAM: Good point. For those who are not familiar,

3151
02:07:02.645 --> 02:07:04.399
Critical Role is a live roleplaying show

3152
02:07:04.399 --> 02:07:05.743
that streams on Thursday nights

3153
02:07:05.743 --> 02:07:07.820
featuring us, a group of best friends

3154
02:07:07.820 --> 02:07:10.473
who happen to be professional voice actors.

3155
02:07:10.473 --> 02:07:12.142
MATT: Now this show has inspired millions of people

3156
02:07:12.142 --> 02:07:14.385
to create incredible fan art and spread

3157
02:07:14.385 --> 02:07:16.914
the love of storytelling to a whole new generation.

3158
02:07:16.914 --> 02:07:18.257
This amazing community has come

3159
02:07:18.257 --> 02:07:20.011
to be known as the Critters.

3160
02:07:20.011 --> 02:07:21.110
You know who you are.

3161
02:07:21.110 --> 02:07:23.025
MARISHA: And the Critter have inspired us to tell

3162
02:07:23.025 --> 02:07:25.431
our stories in books, live events,

3163
02:07:25.431 --> 02:07:27.921
even a Dark Horse comic book series.

3164
02:07:27.921 --> 02:07:29.879
So needless to say, we're pretty stoked

3165
02:07:29.879 --> 02:07:31.302
to finally take the next big step

3166
02:07:31.302 --> 02:07:33.506
and make an animated special.

3167
02:07:33.506 --> 02:07:35.869
LAURA: So without further ado, let's roll that--

3168
02:07:35.869 --> 02:07:37.215
TALIESIN: Not yet!

3169
02:07:37.215 --> 02:07:38.288
LAURA: Grr!

3170
02:07:38.288 --> 02:07:40.448
TALIESIN: They still don't know about our creative partners.

3171
02:07:40.448 --> 02:07:41.303
SAM: Okay.

3172
02:07:41.303 --> 02:07:43.178
TALIESIN: We're not animators, but we happen

3173
02:07:43.178 --> 02:07:45.419
to know some folks who are pretty good at it.

3174
02:07:45.419 --> 02:07:49.984
CHRIS: Are we drawing this (censor beep) cartoon or what?

3175
02:07:49.984 --> 02:07:52.102
It's got action, it's got comedy,

3176
02:07:52.102 --> 02:07:55.074
it's got drunkenness, it's got everything!

3177
02:07:55.074 --> 02:07:57.080
MARISHA: We are also bringing in one of the

3178
02:07:57.080 --> 02:07:59.810
busiest animation writers in the biz to help

3179
02:07:59.810 --> 02:08:02.907
craft a brand new adventure for Vax Machina.

3180
02:08:02.907 --> 02:08:05.240
JENNIFER: Your mom uses spell check.

3181
02:08:06.333 --> 02:08:07.717
Listen, I've been doing this a while

3182
02:08:07.717 --> 02:08:09.347
and I know what you guys want me to say.

3183
02:08:09.347 --> 02:08:10.980
No, I'm not giving any spoilers.

3184
02:08:10.980 --> 02:08:12.608
All I can say is that it is going to be

3185
02:08:12.608 --> 02:08:14.357
in canon and it takes place before

3186
02:08:14.357 --> 02:08:16.069
the streaming show started.

3187
02:08:16.069 --> 02:08:17.944
Also, the bad guy is going to be

3188
02:08:17.944 --> 02:08:21.009
revealed to be none other than--

3189
02:08:21.009 --> 02:08:24.045
SAM: Whew. That was close.

3190
02:08:24.045 --> 02:08:26.082
LIAM: And how about the voices?

3191
02:08:26.082 --> 02:08:27.827
That, my friends, is easy.

3192
02:08:27.827 --> 02:08:29.947
We are all voicing our original roles.

3193
02:08:29.947 --> 02:08:30.780
Matt, too!

3194
02:08:30.780 --> 02:08:32.586
MATT: Well, the ones I can do.

3195
02:08:32.586 --> 02:08:34.694
LIAM: And we'll even be joined by some

3196
02:08:34.694 --> 02:08:36.544
special celebrity cameos.

3197
02:08:36.544 --> 02:08:38.541
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's an all-star lineup.

3198
02:08:38.541 --> 02:08:39.682
Roll the freakin' clip!

3199
02:08:39.682 --> 02:08:41.225
SAM: No, not yet.

3200
02:08:41.225 --> 02:08:42.815
We still need to explain why we

3201
02:08:42.815 --> 02:08:44.772
need the campaign in the first place.

3202
02:08:44.772 --> 02:08:46.537
ASHLEY: Hey guys, I'm sorry to interject,

3203
02:08:46.537 --> 02:08:48.529
but I've been crunching some numbers here.

3204
02:08:48.529 --> 02:08:50.642
One minute of TV quality animation

3205
02:08:50.642 --> 02:08:52.965
costs between 30 to $50,000.

3206
02:08:52.965 --> 02:08:55.452
And our budget of $750,000.

3207
02:08:55.452 --> 02:08:57.163
(rapid beeping)

3208
02:08:57.163 --> 02:08:59.894
TRAVIS (VO): What is going on?

3209
02:08:59.894 --> 02:09:01.199
(clip rewinds)

3210
02:09:01.199 --> 02:09:03.072
Is way more than any media company

3211
02:09:03.072 --> 02:09:04.787
wanted to take a chance on.

3212
02:09:04.787 --> 02:09:07.153
Especially since our show is about

3213
02:09:07.153 --> 02:09:09.759
a fantasy adventuring group named Vox Machina.

3214
02:09:09.759 --> 02:09:12.981
You know, based off of a game.

3215
02:09:12.981 --> 02:09:15.426
Which means we need you to help fund animators,

3216
02:09:15.426 --> 02:09:17.750
background artists, character designers,

3217
02:09:17.750 --> 02:09:19.947
sound and picture editors, storyboards,

3218
02:09:19.947 --> 02:09:22.156
music, special effects, and the writing

3219
02:09:22.156 --> 02:09:25.011
and recording process for 18 months of production.

3220
02:09:25.011 --> 02:09:27.742
But I am 100% sure we can get there

3221
02:09:27.742 --> 02:09:30.190
because after all, I do play a forensic scientist

3222
02:09:30.190 --> 02:09:32.430
on TV, so I know what I'm talking about.

3223
02:09:32.430 --> 02:09:33.895
TRAVIS: Thanks, Ash.

3224
02:09:33.895 --> 02:09:36.112
And with that, it is time to finally

3225
02:09:36.112 --> 02:09:38.437
show you what we have been working on.

3226
02:09:38.437 --> 02:09:40.149
Laura, why don't you do the--

3227
02:09:40.149 --> 02:09:43.132

TRAVIS: You know what, you're right.

3249
02:10:49.801 --> 02:10:51.554
We probably should've led with that.

3250
02:10:51.554 --> 02:10:52.818
LAURA: Yeah, we should have!

3251
02:10:52.818 --> 02:10:54.529
Of course, we wouldn't be Critical Role if we

3252
02:10:54.529 --> 02:10:57.176
didn't have some awesome swag for you guys.

3253
02:10:57.176 --> 02:10:58.564
We'll be rolling out all kinds of campaign

3254
02:10:58.564 --> 02:11:00.357
specific rewards, and the higher up

3255
02:11:00.357 --> 02:11:02.045
you go, the more we can unlock.

3256
02:11:02.045 --> 02:11:03.430
SAM: Remember, if you can't contribute,

3257
02:11:03.430 --> 02:11:04.895
you can still support us by sharing

3258
02:11:04.895 --> 02:11:07.671
the campaign with your rich ass friends.

3259
02:11:07.671 --> 02:11:08.900
Like me. (glass clink)

3260
02:11:08.900 --> 02:11:10.571
TRAVIS: Yes, and keep checking back.

3261
02:11:10.571 --> 02:11:12.523
We will be posting updates with artwork,

3262
02:11:12.523 --> 02:11:15.293
animation, progress reports all along the way.

3263
02:11:15.293 --> 02:11:17.004
You can expect the final delivery

3264
02:11:17.004 --> 02:11:20.950
of The Legend of Vox Machina in the fall of 2020.

3265
02:11:20.950 --> 02:11:22.985
MATT: Now we began this journey five years ago as

3266
02:11:22.985 --> 02:11:25.352
a bunch of voice actors with a love of storytelling.

3267
02:11:25.352 --> 02:11:27.799
With your generosity, we can come full circle

3268
02:11:27.799 --> 02:11:31.429
back to our roots in voiceover animation.

3269
02:11:31.429 --> 02:11:33.422
Thank you for sharing our excitement

3270
02:11:33.422 --> 02:11:35.745
and your support of this project.

3271
02:11:35.745 --> 02:11:38.978
ALL: Bidet, friends!
MATT: Bidet!

3272
02:11:43.670 --> 02:11:46.503
(tribal drumming)

3273
02:12:03.669 --> 02:12:05.421
BRIAN: This week Between the Sheets

3274
02:12:05.421 --> 02:12:06.725
is back with the man, the myth,

3275
02:12:06.725 --> 02:12:08.690
the legend, Mr. Chris Perkins.

3276
02:12:08.690 --> 02:12:10.932
CHRIS: One of the first emails I got in the job

3277
02:12:10.932 --> 02:12:13.336
as the new editor of Dungeon Magazine was from

3278
02:12:13.336 --> 02:12:17.004
some guy, but I kept it because it grounded me.

3279
02:12:17.004 --> 02:12:19.596
BRIAN: What do you mean? What was it?

3280
02:12:19.596 --> 02:12:23.090
CHRIS: "Bring back Dragonlance, you fuck."

3281
02:12:23.090 --> 02:12:24.583
Was the sum total--

3282
02:12:24.583 --> 02:12:25.765
BRIAN: It was from Liam O'Brien.

3283
02:12:25.765 --> 02:12:28.778
(laughter)

3284
02:12:28.778 --> 02:12:30.211
LIAM: Subscribe.

3285
02:12:31.428 --> 02:12:34.211
Or don't subscribe.

3286
02:12:35.751 --> 02:12:37.584
That's not a question.

3287
02:12:39.462 --> 02:12:41.499
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind

3288
02:12:41.499 --> 02:12:43.783
to ponder the pros and more pros

3289
02:12:43.783 --> 02:12:47.492
of Twitch or Twitch Prime,

3290
02:12:47.492 --> 02:12:50.551
or to take hands and gift new subs to Critters

3291
02:12:50.551 --> 02:12:53.218
who find they can't afford them.

3292
02:12:54.468 --> 02:12:55.751
To play.

3293
02:12:58.301 --> 02:12:59.801
To sleep.

3294
02:13:01.110 --> 02:13:02.368
No more.

3295
02:13:03.513 --> 02:13:06.288
And by a sleep to say the cast and crew

3296
02:13:06.288 --> 02:13:08.406
of Critical Role might find their naps

3297
02:13:08.406 --> 02:13:10.154
around their hectic schedule of a

3298
02:13:10.154 --> 02:13:12.807
live broadcast that we have brought for

3299
02:13:12.807 --> 02:13:17.282
your consumption both Critter and fan alike.

3300
02:13:19.530 --> 02:13:23.088
To play, or sleep.

3301
02:13:25.894 --> 02:13:29.777
No sleep, but just to stream.

3302
02:13:31.477 --> 02:13:34.250
Aye, there's the rub.

3303
02:13:34.250 --> 02:13:39.042
For with your subscription, what streams may come.

3304
02:13:42.823 --> 02:13:45.717
Oh man, oh man, oh man, that is a fucking tagline.

3305
02:13:45.717 --> 02:13:46.967
Do we got that?

3306
02:13:48.450 --> 02:13:50.283
That is Twitch poetry.

3307
02:13:52.484 --> 02:13:54.155
Oh, anyway.

Gift some subscriptions, you got it.

3311
02:14:05.970 --> 02:14:10.785
Wrong soliloquy for the skull, but that's fucking good.

[classical music]

3313

[epic orchestral ballad music]

3314
02:27:19.759 --> 02:27:21.620
MATT: Hello everyone and welcome back.

3315
02:27:21.620 --> 02:27:23.208
Sorry, we were having discussions

3316
02:27:23.208 --> 02:27:24.878
about who's better, Joel or Mike.

3317
02:27:24.878 --> 02:27:26.916
Those of you who know, I'm a Joel guy.

3318
02:27:26.916 --> 02:27:27.935
We're mostly Joel guys.

3319
02:27:27.935 --> 02:27:28.955
Bernie's a Mike guy.

3320
02:27:28.955 --> 02:27:30.106
SAM: I'm a Mike guy.

3321
02:27:30.106 --> 02:27:31.059
MATT: Interesting.

3322
02:27:31.059 --> 02:27:32.877
TALIESIN: Mike's great.

3323
02:27:32.877 --> 02:27:34.715
MATT: We have our winner.

3324
02:27:34.715 --> 02:27:36.633
The fantastic Wyrmwood giveaway

3325
02:27:36.633 --> 02:27:39.716
goes to our friend wickdresolution.

3326
02:27:41.034 --> 02:27:42.621
Wickdresolution, who couldn't

3327
02:27:42.621 --> 02:27:46.129
be bothered to put an E in there. You're that cool.

3328
02:27:46.129 --> 02:27:48.411
So wickdresolution, you are the winner

3329
02:27:48.411 --> 02:27:50.818
of the Wyrmwood box. We'll get that to you ASAP.

3330
02:27:50.818 --> 02:27:51.793
Congratulations.

3331
02:27:51.793 --> 02:27:53.219
LIAM: Maybe it's just wick, like a candle.

3332
02:27:53.219 --> 02:27:54.825
Like wick resolution.

3333
02:27:54.825 --> 02:27:56.625
SAM: Sure.

3334
02:27:56.625 --> 02:27:58.625
TALIESIN: Could have a candle company.

3335
02:27:58.625 --> 02:27:59.791
LIAM: Taliesin's with me. Aww.

3336
02:27:59.791 --> 02:28:00.676
TALIESIN: Yay!

3337
02:28:00.676 --> 02:28:01.896
MATT: Phantom tea.

3338
02:28:01.896 --> 02:28:03.620
LAURA: Thank you.

3339
02:28:03.620 --> 02:28:06.643
MATT: Last we left off, you guys have all

3340
02:28:06.643 --> 02:28:09.254
come to consciousness shortly after midnight,

3341
02:28:09.254 --> 02:28:12.069
an hour, two, three hours after you had

3342
02:28:12.069 --> 02:28:15.569
come to rest for the evening, around dusk.

3343
02:28:17.860 --> 02:28:20.022
What would you like to do?

3344
02:28:20.022 --> 02:28:21.489
TALIESIN: Mild calisthenics.

3345
02:28:21.489 --> 02:28:22.834
TRAVIS: No, we're not doing that.

3346
02:28:22.834 --> 02:28:24.299
It's fucking cold out and it's the worst way

3347
02:28:24.299 --> 02:28:26.909
to hurt your joints without warming up first.

3348
02:28:26.909 --> 02:28:28.171
TALIESIN: I learn something new every day.

3349
02:28:28.171 --> 02:28:29.753
TRAVIS: Yep.

3350
02:28:29.753 --> 02:28:31.337
TALIESIN: Let's assemble the troops

3351
02:28:31.337 --> 02:28:33.879
and head to the haunted well.

3352
02:28:33.879 --> 02:28:35.545
TRAVIS and LAURA: Yeah.

3353
02:28:35.545 --> 02:28:36.847
TRAVIS: I mean, shit, we do this right, we'll be

3354
02:28:36.847 --> 02:28:38.800
down that well, close the portal,

3355
02:28:38.800 --> 02:28:40.756
back in our beds before the sun comes up.

3356
02:28:40.756 --> 02:28:41.816
It'll be great.

3357
02:28:41.816 --> 02:28:43.080
LAURA: We need to hurry because the sun

3358
02:28:43.080 --> 02:28:44.465
is going to come up soon, I think.

3359
02:28:44.465 --> 02:28:46.385
TRAVIS: We got a couple hours.

3360
02:28:46.385 --> 02:28:48.583
LIAM: Was there a haunted well where you grew up?

3361
02:28:48.583 --> 02:28:50.581
TALIESIN: No, but I've always really enjoyed

3362
02:28:50.581 --> 02:28:52.250
ghost stories and haunted stories,

3363
02:28:52.250 --> 02:28:55.149
I mean, they're really fascinating.

3364
02:28:55.149 --> 02:28:56.291
You live in a place like that,

3365
02:28:56.291 --> 02:28:58.045
you're bound to hear a few.

3366
02:28:58.045 --> 02:29:00.536
SAM: Thank you for the armor back.

3367
02:29:00.536 --> 02:29:02.002
MARISHA: Thanks for letting me borrow it.

3368
02:29:02.002 --> 02:29:04.502
TRAVIS: No, nope. Nope.

3369
02:29:04.502 --> 02:29:06.650
LIAM: (laughs)

3370
02:29:06.650 --> 02:29:07.483
TRAVIS: Nope.

3371
02:29:09.177 --> 02:29:10.278
No chance.

3372
02:29:10.278 --> 02:29:11.695
SAM: Ready to go.

3373
02:29:14.928 --> 02:29:16.761
LAURA: Did you learn a lot?

3374
02:29:16.761 --> 02:29:19.361
MARISHA: I did. I did.

3375
02:29:20.507 --> 02:29:22.507
Look, we should lay low.

3376
02:29:24.542 --> 02:29:26.784
I think we really need to figure out

3377
02:29:26.784 --> 02:29:28.448
some better disguises if we're

3378
02:29:28.448 --> 02:29:32.323
going to stick around for a little bit. I don't know.

3379
02:29:34.345 --> 02:29:35.997
LIAM: Maybe when the sun is up. I think

3380
02:29:35.997 --> 02:29:37.541
we are all right for the time being.

3381
02:29:37.541 --> 02:29:39.374
Your nose is bleeding.

3382
02:29:40.719 --> 02:29:41.858
We should go, <i>ja</i>?

3383
02:29:41.858 --> 02:29:43.406
TALIESIN: How's your health?

3384
02:29:43.406 --> 02:29:45.847
MARISHA: I'm all right. I rested up a little bit.

3385
02:29:45.847 --> 02:29:47.720
TALIESIN: Need anything? You all right?

3386
02:29:47.720 --> 02:29:50.573
MARISHA: (whispering) I'm at 61 out of 68. (pigeon coo)

3387
02:29:50.573 --> 02:29:51.470
SAM: That's not bad.

3388
02:29:51.470 --> 02:29:52.937
TRAVIS: Yeah, you're fine, let's do it.

3389
02:29:52.937 --> 02:29:56.986
LIAM: That's more than I can ever dream of.

3390
02:29:56.986 --> 02:29:59.107
TRAVIS: We make our way towards the well.

3391
02:29:59.107 --> 02:30:00.327
Stealthily.

3392
02:30:00.327 --> 02:30:01.548
SAM: North center of town.

3393
02:30:01.548 --> 02:30:03.506
MATT: I would like the entire party to make stealth checks.

3394
02:30:03.506 --> 02:30:04.358
Yasha included.

3395
02:30:04.358 --> 02:30:05.191
TRAVIS: You got it.

3396
02:30:05.191 --> 02:30:07.819
SAM: Does anyone want the...

3397
02:30:07.819 --> 02:30:09.326
LAURA: Oh, Pass Without a Trace.

3398
02:30:09.326 --> 02:30:10.385
MARISHA: What'd you do?

3399
02:30:10.385 --> 02:30:11.563
LIAM: Just super average.

3400
02:30:11.563 --> 02:30:14.214
I just miss Vax, guys, I miss the stealth rolls.

3401
02:30:14.214 --> 02:30:16.463
LAURA: I cast Pass Without a Trace on everyone, you guys!

3402
02:30:16.463 --> 02:30:18.174
TALIESIN: (singing) Pass Without a Trace!

3403
02:30:18.174 --> 02:30:20.590
SAM: Anyone want the dodeca?

3404
02:30:22.806 --> 02:30:25.296
LAURA: Somebody should look at it.

3405
02:30:25.296 --> 02:30:29.208
TALIESIN: Whose rolls might end up being--

3406
02:30:29.208 --> 02:30:30.592
LIAM: Tired Beauregard?

3407
02:30:30.592 --> 02:30:33.529
MARISHA: I was going to say Jester to close portals.

3408
02:30:33.529 --> 02:30:34.362
TRAVIS: Do it.

3409
02:30:38.052 --> 02:30:42.633
MATT: All right, so you and take your mote of possibility.

3410
02:30:42.633 --> 02:30:45.161
Fragment of possibility upon yourself, that is taken.

3411
02:30:45.161 --> 02:30:46.550
TRAVIS: 25 and 26.

3412
02:30:46.550 --> 02:30:48.630
MATT: 25 and 26, Beauregard?

3413
02:30:48.630 --> 02:30:49.811
MARISHA: 27.

3414
02:30:49.811 --> 02:30:50.644
LIAM: 23.

3415
02:30:53.010 --> 02:30:54.612
SAM: Wait, do we have a plus something?

3416
02:30:54.612 --> 02:30:55.445
LAURA: Plus ten.

3417
02:30:55.445 --> 02:30:58.753
SAM: Oh yeah. 24.

3418
02:30:58.753 --> 02:30:59.936
LIAM: Come on.

3419
02:30:59.936 --> 02:31:01.194
SAM: 34.

3420
02:31:02.653 --> 02:31:04.319
LAURA: 21.

3421
02:31:04.319 --> 02:31:06.012
TALIESIN: 26.

3422
02:31:06.012 --> 02:31:08.174
MATT: You guys, after a fresh evening's rest,

3423
02:31:08.174 --> 02:31:10.373
apparently that was enough of a reset button

3424
02:31:10.373 --> 02:31:13.628
for you to be deft and silent on your feet.

3425
02:31:13.628 --> 02:31:16.641
As you dodge and quickly delve through

3426
02:31:16.641 --> 02:31:19.049
the various curving pathways and alleys

3427
02:31:19.049 --> 02:31:21.414
of Asarius to the northern region

3428
02:31:21.414 --> 02:31:24.713
you had previously scoped the day before.

3429
02:31:24.713 --> 02:31:27.363
By the hints of barely escaping moonlight

3430
02:31:27.363 --> 02:31:29.727
that purge and tear through elements

3431
02:31:29.727 --> 02:31:32.622
of the moving clouds ahead and above you.

3432
02:31:32.622 --> 02:31:36.080
You guide yourself across and to the region

3433
02:31:36.080 --> 02:31:39.136
of the bugbear you had met earlier.

3434
02:31:39.136 --> 02:31:41.462
You see his abode there before you,

3435
02:31:41.462 --> 02:31:43.458
and where all the streets merge

3436
02:31:43.458 --> 02:31:45.783
and the well around the corner.

3437
02:31:45.783 --> 02:31:48.146
What would you wish to do?

3438
02:31:48.146 --> 02:31:52.020
TRAVIS: Want to follow me? Anyone out?

3439
02:31:52.020 --> 02:31:54.185
MATT: Make a perception check.

3440
02:31:55.071 --> 02:31:57.121
TRAVIS: Shit, five.

3441
02:31:58.539 --> 02:32:02.984
MATT: I mean, there are a few figures patrolling.

3442
02:32:02.984 --> 02:32:05.065
You get the sense here that, as it is

3443
02:32:05.065 --> 02:32:08.487
the City of Beasts, there's a fair balance

3444
02:32:08.487 --> 02:32:12.654
between nocturnal denizens and those that are not.

3445
02:32:14.403 --> 02:32:16.241
As you're making your way through the city

3446
02:32:16.241 --> 02:32:17.911
you do notice that it doesn't seem

3447
02:32:17.911 --> 02:32:20.724
to have really diminished the presence

3448
02:32:20.724 --> 02:32:24.069
of various civilians in the region.

3449
02:32:24.069 --> 02:32:26.513
TRAVIS: Is there a gathering of carts or boxes

3450
02:32:26.513 --> 02:32:29.692
or some sort of cargo anywhere near us?

3451
02:32:29.692 --> 02:32:31.078
MATT: I don't know, man. Not with that perception roll.

3452
02:32:31.078 --> 02:32:32.913
You can't tell.

3453
02:32:32.913 --> 02:32:35.687
TRAVIS: I'll use Minor Illusion and cast a little fire

3454
02:32:35.687 --> 02:32:40.172
just on the ground about 30 feet away from us.

3455
02:32:40.172 --> 02:32:41.923
I'd like to put it either on

3456
02:32:41.923 --> 02:32:44.166
a cart or some parcels or something,

3457
02:32:44.166 --> 02:32:46.894
just so it looks like some start of a fire.

3458
02:32:46.894 --> 02:32:47.954
MATT: Sure.

3459
02:32:47.954 --> 02:32:49.703
SAM: Hobo barrel?

3460
02:32:49.703 --> 02:32:52.203
TRAVIS: Hobo barrel will work.

3461
02:32:55.062 --> 02:32:57.562
LIAM: That's a great juggalo song.

3462
02:32:59.855 --> 02:33:03.605
SAM: Was the entry to the cavern or the pathway

3463
02:33:03.605 --> 02:33:06.463
or whatever below the waterline or above it?

3464
02:33:06.463 --> 02:33:08.011
TRAVIS: Seemed like it was above.

3465
02:33:08.011 --> 02:33:08.844
SAM: Above.

3466
02:33:08.844 --> 02:33:09.965
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3467
02:33:09.965 --> 02:33:13.019
MATT: Seems a bit of rain has begun to touch

3468
02:33:13.019 --> 02:33:16.158
the ground around you, you can hear the

3469
02:33:16.158 --> 02:33:19.012
soft hiss as a small storm begins

3470
02:33:19.012 --> 02:33:22.429
to blow its way over the city of Asarius.

3471
02:33:25.385 --> 02:33:26.813
What are you guys doing?

3472
02:33:26.813 --> 02:33:29.991
TRAVIS: I'm casting Minor Illusion. Create that little fire.

3473
02:33:29.991 --> 02:33:32.722
MATT: A little flame begins to emanate from

3474
02:33:32.722 --> 02:33:37.126
the region with a faint bit of crackling firelight.

3475
02:33:37.126 --> 02:33:39.450
TRAVIS: I'll hop into the well.

3476
02:33:39.450 --> 02:33:42.061
TALIESIN: I'll take the rope and the bucket

3477
02:33:42.061 --> 02:33:43.651
and make my way down as well.

3478
02:33:43.651 --> 02:33:45.440
MATT: You guys move over on the way.

3479
02:33:45.440 --> 02:33:46.581
LAURA: I'm glancing around to see if

3480
02:33:46.581 --> 02:33:48.983
anybody's watching us go into the well.

3481
02:33:48.983 --> 02:33:51.797
MATT: Caduceus, actually, because-- I need to

3482
02:33:51.797 --> 02:33:54.526
look at that more-- because of your perception,

3483
02:33:54.526 --> 02:33:57.909
you do notice as you guys are walking by,

3484
02:33:57.909 --> 02:34:01.167
the structure to your right,

3485
02:34:01.167 --> 02:34:05.798
you glance through one of the small oval-like portholes

3486
02:34:05.798 --> 02:34:10.423
and you see some sort of strange,

3487
02:34:10.423 --> 02:34:15.415
drifting bit of faint blue energy.

3488
02:34:16.520 --> 02:34:18.108
TALIESIN: Eyes of the Grave.

3489
02:34:18.108 --> 02:34:22.533
MATT: Eyes of the Grave. No undead presence,

3490
02:34:22.533 --> 02:34:26.717
but as you look up inside, you just see this faint shimmer.

3491
02:34:28.534 --> 02:34:33.467
You hear, and listen in and hear (giggles).

3492
02:34:35.510 --> 02:34:37.796
A thin, creepy chuckle from the inside.

3493
02:34:37.796 --> 02:34:40.608
LAURA: I'm going to cast Detect Good and Evil.

3494
02:34:40.608 --> 02:34:41.441
MATT: Okay.

3495
02:34:42.958 --> 02:34:47.283
There are two very strong presences

3496
02:34:47.283 --> 02:34:49.415
across the wall here

3497
02:34:49.415 --> 02:34:54.389
that emanate a very defined

3498
02:34:54.389 --> 02:34:57.405
source of evil.

3499
02:34:57.405 --> 02:34:58.629
LAURA: There's really bad things in there,

3500
02:34:58.629 --> 02:35:00.546
there's really bad things in there.

3501
02:35:00.546 --> 02:35:02.668
SAM: These are not in the well, in a building that--

3502
02:35:02.668 --> 02:35:04.377
MATT: As you're moving towards the well,

3503
02:35:04.377 --> 02:35:06.413
to the right of you, the building

3504
02:35:06.413 --> 02:35:08.124
as you're passing across from it.

3505
02:35:08.124 --> 02:35:09.755
SAM: What kind of a building is it?

3506
02:35:09.755 --> 02:35:11.791
A tavern, shop, apartment building?

3507
02:35:11.791 --> 02:35:14.001
MATT: It's a small L-shaped abode.

3508
02:35:14.001 --> 02:35:15.592
Better made than the rest of the

3509
02:35:15.592 --> 02:35:16.934
others you've seen in the vicinity.

3510
02:35:16.934 --> 02:35:18.603
TRAVIS: It's where Armando lives.

3511
02:35:18.603 --> 02:35:19.436
LIAM: Umadon.

3512
02:35:19.436 --> 02:35:20.718
TRAVIS: Yep.

3513
02:35:20.718 --> 02:35:23.369
TALIESIN: Is it Umadon's residence?

3514
02:35:23.369 --> 02:35:25.282
MATT: As he points it out, it is apparently

3515
02:35:25.282 --> 02:35:26.917
where Fjord had sent him towards.

3516
02:35:26.917 --> 02:35:28.302
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

3517
02:35:28.302 --> 02:35:29.135
Oh my gosh.

3518
02:35:29.135 --> 02:35:30.106
TRAVIS: Yeah that's his place.

3519
02:35:30.106 --> 02:35:32.390
He told me that he had a dream where

3520
02:35:32.390 --> 02:35:35.112
a male and a female bugbear came together and did

3521
02:35:35.112 --> 02:35:37.437
fantastic things and then made him kill wolves.

3522
02:35:37.437 --> 02:35:39.272
TALIESIN: Do we want to take care of this right now?

3523
02:35:39.272 --> 02:35:40.439
TRAVIS: I mean, yeah.

3524
02:35:41.880 --> 02:35:43.794
LAURA: We should definitely do that.

3525
02:35:43.794 --> 02:35:45.470
Can we go inside?

3526
02:35:45.470 --> 02:35:47.671
TALIESIN: You still have Pass without a Trace right?

3527
02:35:47.671 --> 02:35:49.024
MARISHA: We do.

3528
02:35:49.024 --> 02:35:51.549
Does there appear to be any type of

3529
02:35:51.549 --> 02:35:54.299
chimney or roof, other entrances?

3530
02:35:55.260 --> 02:35:56.957
MATT: From where you were just moving down

3531
02:35:56.957 --> 02:35:58.989
the side, there doesn't appear to be a chimney.

3532
02:35:58.989 --> 02:36:01.434
There are the little oval-type openings

3533
02:36:01.434 --> 02:36:04.572
in the stones that are stacked to create this building.

3534
02:36:04.572 --> 02:36:06.857
You could squeeze through

3535
02:36:06.857 --> 02:36:10.689
carefully, a human of you or Fjord's size.

3536
02:36:10.689 --> 02:36:12.641
Nott can get through easily.

3537
02:36:12.641 --> 02:36:14.558
Does not appear to be paned with glass,

3538
02:36:14.558 --> 02:36:16.185
but it is a bit precarious and it isn't

3539
02:36:16.185 --> 02:36:19.039
an easy leap through type circumstance.

3540
02:36:19.039 --> 02:36:22.095
There is a front door around the corner.

3541
02:36:22.095 --> 02:36:24.582
TALIESIN: I say we just go in the front door.

3542
02:36:24.582 --> 02:36:28.745
SAM: Why don't we attack from different vantage points?

3543
02:36:28.745 --> 02:36:30.088
LIAM: And I'm sorry, did we say that there

3544
02:36:30.088 --> 02:36:32.086
are denizens wandering around this area?

3545
02:36:32.086 --> 02:36:33.268
MATT: There are, but no one seems to be

3546
02:36:33.268 --> 02:36:34.101
paying immediate attention to you.

3547
02:36:34.101 --> 02:36:34.934
They're just going about their business in the night.

3548
02:36:37.141 --> 02:36:38.118
You guys are pretty stealthy,

3549
02:36:38.118 --> 02:36:39.504
so no one's really noticed that you've--

3550
02:36:39.504 --> 02:36:40.768
you haven't been getting anyone's eye

3551
02:36:40.768 --> 02:36:43.134
or attention this late at night.

3552
02:36:43.134 --> 02:36:44.884
TALIESIN: I mean it's not a very big house right?

3553
02:36:44.884 --> 02:36:46.108
MATT: No, it's not at all.

3554
02:36:46.108 --> 02:36:47.412
TRAVIS: There aren't a lot of other ways in, right?

3555
02:36:47.412 --> 02:36:48.514
TALIESIN: I say we go in and take--

3556
02:36:48.514 --> 02:36:49.754
SAM: There's a window right?

3557
02:36:49.754 --> 02:36:50.629
TRAVIS: Oh.

3558
02:36:50.629 --> 02:36:55.378
MATT:There appear to be two oval-shaped windows

3559
02:36:55.378 --> 02:36:57.701
that are small to the point where,

3560
02:36:57.701 --> 02:36:58.884
other than Nott, anyone else would have

3561
02:36:58.884 --> 02:37:00.474
to climb up and push through into

3562
02:37:00.474 --> 02:37:02.877
the space, but there's a front door.

3563
02:37:02.877 --> 02:37:03.814
TRAVIS: Go in the front.

3564
02:37:03.814 --> 02:37:05.079
SAM: I'm going in the window.

3565
02:37:05.079 --> 02:37:06.628
I'm going to take a big swig of liquor

3566
02:37:06.628 --> 02:37:08.463
and creep up to the window.

3567
02:37:08.463 --> 02:37:11.031
TALIESIN: We might need you to unlock the door.

3568
02:37:11.031 --> 02:37:12.418
MATT: Okay, the rest of you are going in the front?

3569
02:37:12.418 --> 02:37:13.911
Or are you waiting on Nott?

3570
02:37:13.911 --> 02:37:15.092
What are you doing?

3571
02:37:15.092 --> 02:37:16.560
LAURA: No, we're going to go to the front.

3572
02:37:16.560 --> 02:37:17.656
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're going to the front.

3573
02:37:17.656 --> 02:37:19.169
MATT: You guys go to the front door.

3574
02:37:19.169 --> 02:37:20.106
It's locked.

3575
02:37:20.106 --> 02:37:21.736
MARISHA: The portals were from

3576
02:37:21.736 --> 02:37:24.236
a nine hills, a hellish plane?

3577
02:37:25.488 --> 02:37:26.872
MATT: It seemed to be abyssal in nature.

3578
02:37:26.872 --> 02:37:27.930
MARISHA: Abyssal, right.

3579
02:37:27.930 --> 02:37:29.719
MATT: There is a variation between devils and demons.

3580
02:37:29.719 --> 02:37:30.900
They're both fiends, but they are

3581
02:37:30.900 --> 02:37:35.225
two different sides of the evil outer plane conflict.

3582
02:37:35.225 --> 02:37:36.978
TRAVIS: Yasha will walk out to the front door

3583
02:37:36.978 --> 02:37:38.524
and kick that fucking shit in.

3584
02:37:38.524 --> 02:37:39.910
SAM: Oh Jesus.

3585
02:37:39.910 --> 02:37:41.007
MATT: Okay.

3586
02:37:41.007 --> 02:37:44.757
Go ahead and make a strength check for Yasha.

3587
02:37:46.035 --> 02:37:47.285
TRAVIS: That is a 23.

3588
02:37:49.956 --> 02:37:54.539
MATT: Okay, well this is definitely drawing some attention.

3589
02:37:57.499 --> 02:38:00.068
As you're carefully coming up and peeking over

3590
02:38:00.068 --> 02:38:03.985
the side you can see a very simple bed chamber.

3591
02:38:05.288 --> 02:38:08.599
It looks to be a small brazier or torch

3592
02:38:08.599 --> 02:38:11.740
on the wall that has mostly burned down to embers.

3593
02:38:11.740 --> 02:38:13.410
It looks to be a small unit with

3594
02:38:13.410 --> 02:38:17.145
a couple of shelves, some roughshod boxes

3595
02:38:17.145 --> 02:38:19.748
and containers on the opposite end,

3596
02:38:19.748 --> 02:38:22.373
and a wide bed made from

3597
02:38:22.373 --> 02:38:25.754
leftover crates that have had bits of furs

3598
02:38:25.754 --> 02:38:28.488
and leathers and whatever softish material

3599
02:38:28.488 --> 02:38:31.425
and placed on it to form a bed that exists there.

3600
02:38:31.425 --> 02:38:34.805
On the bed, you see that same bugbear that you

3601
02:38:34.805 --> 02:38:38.957
had come across earlier that Fjord was interrogating.

3602
02:38:38.957 --> 02:38:41.364
Is currently lying on their back

3603
02:38:41.364 --> 02:38:43.607
with a wide grin on its face.

3604
02:38:43.607 --> 02:38:45.111
SAM: Is it fucking ghosts right now?

3605
02:38:45.111 --> 02:38:45.944
MATT: No.

3606
02:38:45.944 --> 02:38:46.777
SAM: Okay.

3607
02:38:46.777 --> 02:38:49.553
MATT: In two different corners of the chamber,

3608
02:38:49.553 --> 02:38:52.803
you see two somewhat ethereal entities.

3609
02:38:55.424 --> 02:38:58.424
One of them appears to be a bugbear,

3610
02:38:59.831 --> 02:39:03.988
but is somewhat ghostly, translucent, light blue,

3611
02:39:03.988 --> 02:39:07.655
and is dressed in a very provocative manner.

3612
02:39:09.690 --> 02:39:12.020
The bugbear ghost.

3613
02:39:12.020 --> 02:39:13.324
LIAM: Hot bugbear ghost.

3614
02:39:13.324 --> 02:39:14.792
MATT: It seems to be on one side, the other side

3615
02:39:14.792 --> 02:39:16.948
you see another male bugbear, slender,

3616
02:39:16.948 --> 02:39:20.781
wide shoulders, dressed in elements of leather straps

3617
02:39:24.935 --> 02:39:28.806
from one shoulder to the other across.

3618
02:39:28.806 --> 02:39:31.090
They're both in the process of hands

3619
02:39:31.090 --> 02:39:34.590
extended towards this sleeping individual.

3620
02:39:36.142 --> 02:39:39.074
You watch as this faint tether of that

3621
02:39:39.074 --> 02:39:42.300
faint blue energy, that sparkling type

3622
02:39:42.300 --> 02:39:46.624
of incantation that had caught

3623
02:39:46.624 --> 02:39:49.775
Caduceus' eyes, had passed, drifting towards

3624
02:39:49.775 --> 02:39:53.559
him as he sleeps and causing him to writhe.

3625
02:39:53.559 --> 02:39:54.986
As you make this observation--

3626
02:39:54.986 --> 02:39:57.104
SAM: I will start to cast Message.

3627
02:39:57.104 --> 02:39:57.937
MATT: (whump)

3628
02:39:57.937 --> 02:39:59.497
SAM: Fuck.

3629
02:39:59.497 --> 02:40:02.360
MATT: You hear a wooden door crack open as Yasha

3630
02:40:02.360 --> 02:40:04.683
kicks in the front door, it splinters open.

3631
02:40:04.683 --> 02:40:07.126
Comes partially off the main top hinge.

3632
02:40:07.126 --> 02:40:08.868
You guys enter the building immediately

3633
02:40:08.868 --> 02:40:10.659
and can see across the way another

3634
02:40:10.659 --> 02:40:13.840
low burning torch, a relatively simple

3635
02:40:13.840 --> 02:40:18.826
chamber with a somewhat curved countertop of some kind,

3636
02:40:20.443 --> 02:40:22.723
and a table that has a few tools

3637
02:40:22.723 --> 02:40:25.289
and defense weapons on them.

3638
02:40:25.289 --> 02:40:26.998
To the left, you see a simple

3639
02:40:26.998 --> 02:40:30.011
dining room table, it is not well kept.

3640
02:40:30.011 --> 02:40:32.452
One of the legs is partially broken and you see

3641
02:40:32.452 --> 02:40:36.119
these long stools or benches across from it.

3642
02:40:37.343 --> 02:40:40.403
Immediately you see another door that leads to

3643
02:40:40.403 --> 02:40:42.970
a secondary chamber that leads in

3644
02:40:42.970 --> 02:40:44.805
the direction of the bedroom that

3645
02:40:44.805 --> 02:40:47.129
you had seen as you passed by.

3646
02:40:47.129 --> 02:40:49.043
SAM: Do the ghosts react?

3647
02:40:49.043 --> 02:40:49.876
MATT: Oh, yeah.

3648
02:40:49.876 --> 02:40:51.565
They immediately glance over in that direction

3649
02:40:51.565 --> 02:40:56.315
and you watch as their ghostly forms become less ghostly.

3650
02:40:57.317 --> 02:40:59.479
Make a perception check for me, if you don't mind.

3651
02:40:59.479 --> 02:41:00.537
SAM: Yeah, I'm great at these.

3652
02:41:00.537 --> 02:41:01.433
Natural 20.

3653
02:41:01.433 --> 02:41:02.938
(cheering)

3654
02:41:02.938 --> 02:41:04.444
TALIESIN: You're great at these.

3655
02:41:04.444 --> 02:41:06.647
MATT: They both drift into the far corners

3656
02:41:06.647 --> 02:41:08.115
of the chamber, and as they do

3657
02:41:08.115 --> 02:41:11.783
you watch as their body changes shape.

3658
02:41:11.783 --> 02:41:14.427
Instead of the bugbear figures you see,

3659
02:41:14.427 --> 02:41:17.648
the fur gives away to soft flesh.

3660
02:41:17.648 --> 02:41:19.192
Human-like.

3661
02:41:19.192 --> 02:41:23.026
You see leathery wings

3662
02:41:23.026 --> 02:41:26.286
emerge from the shoulders of each of them,

3663
02:41:26.286 --> 02:41:29.625
right as they back into the far-shaded

3664
02:41:29.625 --> 02:41:32.111
corners of the chamber.

3665
02:41:32.111 --> 02:41:34.433
Let's have a roll initiative if you don't mind.

3666
02:41:34.433 --> 02:41:37.183
TRAVIS: Were they talking at all?

3667
02:41:38.253 --> 02:41:39.086
MATT: You didn't hear any conversation.

3668
02:41:39.086 --> 02:41:39.919
TRAVIS: Okay.

3669
02:41:39.919 --> 02:41:40.836
LIAM: Oh shite.

3670
02:41:45.241 --> 02:41:48.991
SAM: Guys, D&amp;D Beyond has a promo code going now.

3671
02:41:51.103 --> 02:41:53.344
You can either use ISUPPORTSAM,

3672
02:41:53.344 --> 02:41:54.935
I think that was what it was.

3673
02:41:54.935 --> 02:41:56.157
LIAM: No, that's not a code.

3674
02:41:56.157 --> 02:41:58.931
It's just ISUPPORTLIAM, they only have one code.

3675
02:41:58.931 --> 02:42:00.197
SAM: There were two codes.

3676
02:42:00.197 --> 02:42:02.320
It's ISUPPORTSAM or ISUPPORTLIAM.

3677
02:42:02.320 --> 02:42:05.906
Both codes provide a 25% off any digital books,

3678
02:42:05.906 --> 02:42:08.553
full digital books in your cart.

3679
02:42:08.553 --> 02:42:10.874
But the Sam one is better.

3680
02:42:10.874 --> 02:42:12.751
LIAM: I think the ISUPPORTSAM is actually

3681
02:42:12.751 --> 02:42:15.168
one point less of a discount.

3682
02:42:16.582 --> 02:42:19.237
SAM: I think it's cooler.

3683
02:42:19.237 --> 02:42:20.824
TALIESIN: You know, no, no, no.

3684
02:42:20.824 --> 02:42:22.327
MATT: Who is where at the front of this building?

3685
02:42:22.327 --> 02:42:24.120
As far as the order goes, if you don't mind.

3686
02:42:24.120 --> 02:42:25.465
TALIESIN: I'm thinking about it.

3687
02:42:25.465 --> 02:42:27.009
LIAM: Caleb's at the rear just going over

3688
02:42:27.009 --> 02:42:29.294
spells in his head nervously.

3689
02:42:29.294 --> 02:42:31.129
MATT: You're in the building towards the back?

3690
02:42:31.129 --> 02:42:33.900
LIAM: The back, wherever, I'm back of everybody.

3691
02:42:33.900 --> 02:42:35.529
If Caduceus is outside I'm behind him.

3692
02:42:35.529 --> 02:42:37.078
MATT: Caduceus, where are you?

3693
02:42:37.078 --> 02:42:40.376
TALIESIN: I'm probably right--

3694
02:42:40.376 --> 02:42:42.784
going to push into the corner up there.

3695
02:42:42.784 --> 02:42:45.534
Can I see them, where are they? Okay.

3696
02:42:45.534 --> 02:42:46.979
MATT: No, you don't see anything, the door is closed.

3697
02:42:46.979 --> 02:42:49.100
MARISHA: I'll be behind Josh then.

3698
02:42:49.100 --> 02:42:50.402
MATT: Beau, you're behind Yasha.

3699
02:42:50.402 --> 02:42:53.497
LIAM: I guess I'll just be peeking in the door from outside.

3700
02:42:53.497 --> 02:42:54.330
MATT: From there?

3701
02:42:54.330 --> 02:42:55.535
LIAM: Yeah, that's good.

3702
02:42:55.535 --> 02:42:56.368
Thank you.

3703
02:42:57.471 --> 02:43:00.425
MATT: There's Jester. Fjord, where are you?

3704
02:43:00.425 --> 02:43:03.458
TRAVIS: In the room.

3705
02:43:03.458 --> 02:43:06.682
MATT: In relation to the rest of the party.

3706
02:43:06.682 --> 02:43:08.312
TRAVIS: Anywhere I fit.

3707
02:43:08.312 --> 02:43:09.328
MATT: Anywhere you fit?

3708
02:43:09.328 --> 02:43:10.346
SAM: On a table.

3709
02:43:10.346 --> 02:43:11.857
MATT: Probably next to Yasha or the bear or--

3710
02:43:11.857 --> 02:43:13.159
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, that's fine.

3711
02:43:13.159 --> 02:43:14.159
MATT: All right.

3712
02:43:15.156 --> 02:43:19.073
There is the sleeping bugbear on the bed there.

3713
02:43:20.169 --> 02:43:22.940
LAURA: It's a very teeny space to fight in.

3714
02:43:22.940 --> 02:43:24.369
MATT: There are the two figures

3715
02:43:24.369 --> 02:43:27.304
in the chamber, but only Nott sees those.

3716
02:43:27.304 --> 02:43:31.887
Let's go ahead and get initiative put on you guys here.

3717
02:43:38.495 --> 02:43:40.578
TALIESIN: That was a lot of dice.

3718
02:43:41.773 --> 02:43:43.018
MATT: It was a single die.

3719
02:43:43.018 --> 02:43:43.851
TALIESIN: Really?

3720
02:43:43.851 --> 02:43:45.184
That had reverb.

3721
02:43:46.443 --> 02:43:50.031
Turn off the reverb on the [inaudible].

3722
02:43:50.031 --> 02:43:51.906
MATT: At that point, I would say

3723
02:43:51.906 --> 02:43:54.553
initiative wise, 25 to 20, anybody?

3724
02:43:54.553 --> 02:43:55.816
SAM: I got 20.

3725
02:43:55.816 --> 02:43:57.977
MATT: 20. Nott is--

3726
02:43:57.977 --> 02:43:58.810
All right.

3727
02:43:59.891 --> 02:44:00.828
20 to 15.

3728
02:44:00.828 --> 02:44:02.104
TALIESIN: 17
LAURA: 19.

3729
02:44:02.104 --> 02:44:03.122
MATT: 19 for Jester.

3730
02:44:03.122 --> 02:44:03.955
MARISHA: 18.

3731
02:44:05.731 --> 02:44:06.564
LIAM: 16.

3732
02:44:08.338 --> 02:44:09.421
TALIESIN: 17 for Cad.

3733
02:44:10.787 --> 02:44:12.387
MATT: Beau-- Sorry, 16 for--

3734
02:44:12.387 --> 02:44:13.220
LIAM: 16, yeah.

3735
02:44:13.220 --> 02:44:14.220
MATT: So Caduceus.

3736
02:44:15.534 --> 02:44:17.778
MARISHA: You were so stoked that. Did you roll well?

3737
02:44:17.778 --> 02:44:21.322
TALIESIN: This was a really good roll for me.

3738
02:44:21.322 --> 02:44:22.178
MARISHA: It was so cute.

3739
02:44:22.178 --> 02:44:24.428
TALIESIN: I got plans, man. Plans.

3740
02:44:25.885 --> 02:44:27.475
MATT: 15 to 10?

3741
02:44:27.475 --> 02:44:28.944
TRAVIS: Yasha rolled a 14.

3742
02:44:28.944 --> 02:44:33.236
LIAM: That's just, like, your opinion, man.

3743
02:44:34.565 --> 02:44:36.066
TALIESIN: Got some good spells that are really--

3744
02:44:36.066 --> 02:44:36.920
MATT: Nott, what'd you get?

3745
02:44:36.920 --> 02:44:40.099
Oh yeah, you guys are being grouped together.

3746
02:44:40.099 --> 02:44:44.095
All right, and Fjord is holding at the rear.

3747
02:44:44.095 --> 02:44:47.760
Great, so Nott, the minute that impact hits

3748
02:44:47.760 --> 02:44:49.147
and you see the figures on the side,

3749
02:44:49.147 --> 02:44:51.229
you're the only one who can really see them.

3750
02:44:51.229 --> 02:44:54.005
You watch as they both curl up

3751
02:44:54.005 --> 02:44:56.246
and fly into the far corners of shadow,

3752
02:44:56.246 --> 02:44:58.746
just waiting around that door.

3753
02:44:59.834 --> 02:45:00.976
SAM: So they're hiding?

3754
02:45:00.976 --> 02:45:02.393
MATT: They're hiding.

3755
02:45:03.873 --> 02:45:06.193
In these upper corners right there.

3756
02:45:06.193 --> 02:45:09.777
What will you do with your turn, buddy?

3757
02:45:09.777 --> 02:45:11.164
SAM: Oh boy.

3758
02:45:11.164 --> 02:45:12.261
MATT: Come on.

3759
02:45:12.261 --> 02:45:16.150
SAM: Oh boy. I could just attack, or I could...

3760
02:45:16.150 --> 02:45:17.058
MATT: Mrs. Nott.

3761
02:45:17.058 --> 02:45:17.891
LIAM: Miss Nott.

3762
02:45:19.313 --> 02:45:20.943
LAURA: Do you want to attack them?

3763
02:45:20.943 --> 02:45:21.776
SAM: Nope.

3764
02:45:22.695 --> 02:45:25.887
I'll continue casting message.

3765
02:45:25.887 --> 02:45:28.482
SAM: I will just send a message to Caleb

3766
02:45:28.482 --> 02:45:32.307
and say: Two in the room hiding in the ceiling

3767
02:45:32.307 --> 02:45:35.943
upper corners when you come through the door!

3768
02:45:35.943 --> 02:45:39.901
MATT: Make an additional stealth check.

3769
02:45:39.901 --> 02:45:42.062
You are outside the radius of Jester's spell,

3770
02:45:42.062 --> 02:45:44.264
so you do not get the plus ten bonus.

3771
02:45:44.264 --> 02:45:45.486
This is to see if you can quietly

3772
02:45:45.486 --> 02:45:47.440
convey that without their noticing.

3773
02:45:47.440 --> 02:45:49.030
TALIESIN and LAURA: Natural 20.

3774
02:45:49.030 --> 02:45:50.145
MARISHA: Oh shit!

3775
02:45:50.145 --> 02:45:50.978
TRAVIS: Wow!

3776
02:45:53.377 --> 02:45:55.864
MATT: As deftly as you could expect,

3777
02:45:55.864 --> 02:45:58.715
and practiced with message, you sit there

3778
02:45:58.715 --> 02:46:02.055
and both carefully place the emission

3779
02:46:02.055 --> 02:46:04.453
of your breath through your lips

3780
02:46:04.453 --> 02:46:06.289
and keep it below the stone to where

3781
02:46:06.289 --> 02:46:09.431
none of that sound seems to even barely creep

3782
02:46:09.431 --> 02:46:12.449
into the chamber through that porthole.

3783
02:46:12.449 --> 02:46:13.507
They don't take notice.

3784
02:46:13.507 --> 02:46:14.405
You finish casting Message

3785
02:46:14.405 --> 02:46:15.874
and notify Caleb. That's your action.

3786
02:46:15.874 --> 02:46:17.341
Any movement?

3787
02:46:17.341 --> 02:46:19.054
SAM: No, no movement.

3788
02:46:19.054 --> 02:46:22.421
I mean, I'll just stay there, stay there.

3789
02:46:22.421 --> 02:46:24.671
With bonus action,

3790
02:46:24.671 --> 02:46:28.303
can I activate Mage Hand,

3791
02:46:28.303 --> 02:46:29.771
just to have it?

3792
02:46:29.771 --> 02:46:32.771
MATT: You can cast it as a bonus action?

3793
02:46:33.800 --> 02:46:35.208
LAURA: Cast it as action.

3794
02:46:35.208 --> 02:46:36.880
SAM: Yeah, but then I have some other ability.

3795
02:46:36.880 --> 02:46:37.899
I'll look later.

3796
02:46:37.899 --> 02:46:39.570
If I can, I will.

3797
02:46:39.570 --> 02:46:40.753
MATT: Okay, well think about while it's

3798
02:46:40.753 --> 02:46:42.874
somebody else's turn, that's fine.

3799
02:46:42.874 --> 02:46:44.829
That's fine, I'll keep it at bay.

3800
02:46:44.829 --> 02:46:48.529
That ends your go, Nott. Jester, you are up next.

3801
02:46:48.529 --> 02:46:50.177
LAURA: Okay.

3802
02:46:50.177 --> 02:46:55.127
I'm going to run forward and open the door.

3803
02:46:58.454 --> 02:46:59.954
LIAM: Solo hit points.

3804
02:47:01.878 --> 02:47:03.486
LAURA: And step back.

3805
02:47:04.896 --> 02:47:05.832
As much as I can.

3806
02:47:05.832 --> 02:47:06.665
MATT: This way?

3807
02:47:06.665 --> 02:47:07.498
LAURA: Yeah.

3808
02:47:07.498 --> 02:47:08.603
MATT: You have five more feet to go there.

3809
02:47:08.603 --> 02:47:11.753
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to Invoke Duplicity.

3810
02:47:11.753 --> 02:47:15.084
MATT: All right, and where are you invoking it?

3811
02:47:15.084 --> 02:47:18.913
LAURA: In front of me, but I'm having her run into the room.

3812
02:47:18.913 --> 02:47:20.055
TALIESIN: Well done.

3813
02:47:21.480 --> 02:47:23.964
LAURA: And I'm going to make it look like

3814
02:47:23.964 --> 02:47:27.100
she's casting Spiritual Weapon

3815
02:47:27.100 --> 02:47:30.183
right in front of her. A giant lollipop.

3816
02:47:31.503 --> 02:47:32.931
MATT: Okay.

3817
02:47:32.931 --> 02:47:35.773
Let me just do a quick reminder glance,

3818
02:47:35.773 --> 02:47:37.973
Invoke Duplicity is an interesting,

3819
02:47:37.973 --> 02:47:41.140
unique, and strange cleric capability.

3820
02:47:46.080 --> 02:47:48.013
(reading) "As a bonus action, move it up to 30 feet."

3821
02:47:48.880 --> 02:47:51.119
SAM: I use bonus action to control the hand.

3822
02:47:51.119 --> 02:47:52.384
But I think I need to do

3823
02:47:52.384 --> 02:47:55.562
an action to activate it, so forget it.

3824
02:47:55.562 --> 02:48:00.292
MATT: Okay, so you cannot create spell effects around it.

3825
02:48:00.292 --> 02:48:02.496
Your duplicate begins to look like

3826
02:48:02.496 --> 02:48:04.331
it's casting a spell, but there are no

3827
02:48:04.331 --> 02:48:07.181
additional flaring effects of the spell appearing.

3828
02:48:07.181 --> 02:48:09.669
LAURA: Yeah, but I cast spells through the duplicate.

3829
02:48:09.669 --> 02:48:12.702
I can do that, so I'm casting Spiritual Weapon

3830
02:48:12.702 --> 02:48:15.349
through the duplicate is all that I meant.

3831
02:48:15.349 --> 02:48:16.533
MATT: You are casting Spiritual Weapon?

3832
02:48:16.533 --> 02:48:18.084
LAURA: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

3833
02:48:18.084 --> 02:48:20.852
MATT: We'll you create Invoke Duplicity in here,

3834
02:48:20.852 --> 02:48:22.970
it's a bonus action to cause it to move.

3835
02:48:22.970 --> 02:48:24.027
You can either cast the spell

3836
02:48:24.027 --> 02:48:25.210
or cause it to move, but you can

3837
02:48:25.210 --> 02:48:26.312
create it within 30 feet of you,

3838
02:48:26.312 --> 02:48:28.242
so you'll create it in the room then.

3839
02:48:28.242 --> 02:48:29.575
So it'll appear.

3840
02:48:33.581 --> 02:48:35.861
LAURA and MATT: Okay.

3841
02:48:35.861 --> 02:48:38.944
LIAM: I saw flea market Laura Bailey.

3842
02:48:39.858 --> 02:48:42.266
MATT: You're choosing to have it appear in the chamber.

3843
02:48:42.266 --> 02:48:43.099
LAURA: Yeah.

3844
02:48:44.263 --> 02:48:46.014
MATT: You watch in the center of the room

3845
02:48:46.014 --> 02:48:48.257
as suddenly a duplicate Jester illusion

3846
02:48:48.257 --> 02:48:50.906
just apparates in the center of the chamber.

3847
02:48:50.906 --> 02:48:52.823
LAURA: She's looking like she

3848
02:48:52.823 --> 02:48:54.939
bamfed in and she's ready to fight.

3849
02:48:54.939 --> 02:48:56.566
MATT: All right, and then your bonus action

3850
02:48:56.566 --> 02:48:57.991
is casting Spiritual Weapon where?

3851
02:48:57.991 --> 02:49:00.354
LAURA: She's casting Spiritual Weapon right over

3852
02:49:00.354 --> 02:49:03.006
the bed, like she's protecting the bugbear.

3853
02:49:03.006 --> 02:49:04.006
MATT: All right.

3854
02:49:05.977 --> 02:49:08.468
Right in that area there. Okay.

3855
02:49:08.468 --> 02:49:10.706
You do not see any targets.

3856
02:49:10.706 --> 02:49:13.642
You have no one to attack with it, but it has been cast.

3857
02:49:13.642 --> 02:49:15.312
LAURA: Okay, can I swing it wildly

3858
02:49:15.312 --> 02:49:18.044
just to see if it hits anything?

3859
02:49:18.044 --> 02:49:20.165
MATT: Sure, roll an attack.

3860
02:49:20.165 --> 02:49:21.956
LAURA: I think there's ghosts in there.

3861
02:49:21.956 --> 02:49:24.889
MATT: Okay, go for it, roll an attack.

3862
02:49:24.889 --> 02:49:28.681
LAURA: Uh, no. 11, no.

3863
02:49:28.681 --> 02:49:29.514
12.

3864
02:49:31.249 --> 02:49:33.082
MATT: Swings wildly.

3865
02:49:33.082 --> 02:49:34.422
Doesn't seem to impact anything,

3866
02:49:34.422 --> 02:49:35.766
but you got to give it a shot, why not?

3867
02:49:35.766 --> 02:49:36.700
LAURA: Might as well try.

3868
02:49:36.700 --> 02:49:38.463
MATT: Yeah. All right, that finishes your go, Jester.

3869
02:49:38.463 --> 02:49:40.078
Next up is Beau with Caduceus on deck.

3870
02:49:40.078 --> 02:49:41.423
Beau, what you got?

3871
02:49:41.423 --> 02:49:42.256
MARISHA: I...

3872
02:49:44.562 --> 02:49:46.475
Peek into the room, peek

3873
02:49:46.475 --> 02:49:49.558
around the corner with my goggles on.

3874
02:49:51.274 --> 02:49:53.528
MATT: 25, and so--

3875
02:49:53.528 --> 02:49:56.586
MARISHA: Kind of stealthily, just want to check the room.

3876
02:49:56.586 --> 02:49:58.093
MATT: I'll say perception check, since you're

3877
02:49:58.093 --> 02:49:59.560
looking specifically for something,

3878
02:49:59.560 --> 02:50:02.655
go ahead and this'll be your bonus action.

3879
02:50:02.655 --> 02:50:04.905
MARISHA: Yeah, that's good. 20.

3880
02:50:05.789 --> 02:50:06.622
MATT: 20?

3881
02:50:06.622 --> 02:50:08.482
MARISHA: No, sorry, 22.

3882
02:50:08.482 --> 02:50:09.315
MATT: 22.

3883
02:50:09.315 --> 02:50:10.148
MARISHA: Yeah.

3884
02:50:10.148 --> 02:50:10.981
MATT: Okay.

3885
02:50:15.046 --> 02:50:18.507
You do not see anything but the sleeping bugbear.

3886
02:50:18.507 --> 02:50:20.254
You glance in-- or no, I'm sorry. You see

3887
02:50:20.254 --> 02:50:22.456
the sleeping bugbear, you see Jester's

3888
02:50:22.456 --> 02:50:24.451
spiritual weapon just swinging wildly

3889
02:50:24.451 --> 02:50:27.223
over it just some weird Willy Wonka nightmare,

3890
02:50:27.223 --> 02:50:31.591
and you see the duplicate of Jester

3891
02:50:31.591 --> 02:50:34.031
in the chamber looking around and making

3892
02:50:34.031 --> 02:50:35.781
hand motions like it's controlling

3893
02:50:35.781 --> 02:50:37.983
the spiritual weapon, but that's all you see.

3894
02:50:37.983 --> 02:50:39.612
MARISHA: You said that was my action?

3895
02:50:39.612 --> 02:50:40.550
MATT: That was your bonus action.

3896
02:50:40.550 --> 02:50:41.609
MARISHA: My bonus action.

3897
02:50:41.609 --> 02:50:45.276
I will hold my action 'till I see something.

3898
02:50:46.644 --> 02:50:48.590
In case it comes running out the door.

3899
02:50:48.590 --> 02:50:49.935
MATT: Okay, you got it.

3900
02:50:49.935 --> 02:50:51.236
In case you see anything come by,

3901
02:50:51.236 --> 02:50:52.906
you're going to hit it.

3902
02:50:52.906 --> 02:50:55.937
That finishes your go, Beau. Caduceus, you're up.

3903
02:50:55.937 --> 02:50:58.760
SAM: Why are you so low on the initiative, Caleb?

3904
02:50:58.760 --> 02:51:00.229
TALIESIN: I'm going to, because these things

3905
02:51:00.229 --> 02:51:03.365
are weird, I'm going to try and position myself

3906
02:51:03.365 --> 02:51:05.484
so I can get a good look at everybody.

3907
02:51:05.484 --> 02:51:07.728
I know I can't see Nott, but I'm going to--

3908
02:51:07.728 --> 02:51:08.910
MATT: You can't see any of these things.

3909
02:51:08.910 --> 02:51:09.926
You have no idea what happened.

3910
02:51:09.926 --> 02:51:12.015
TALIESIN: No, but I want to be able to see our whole party.

3911
02:51:12.015 --> 02:51:13.276
I know that Beau just--

3912
02:51:13.276 --> 02:51:14.580
MATT: Where do you want to move?

3913
02:51:14.580 --> 02:51:16.330
TALIESIN: Somewhere where I can see Beau.

3914
02:51:16.330 --> 02:51:17.550
MATT: You can see Beau where you are currently.

3915
02:51:17.550 --> 02:51:18.693
TALIESIN: Oh, who's in the room, then?

3916
02:51:18.693 --> 02:51:19.630
MATT: You're right there.

3917
02:51:19.630 --> 02:51:21.180
TALIESINL I mean who's in the other room?

3918
02:51:21.180 --> 02:51:22.013
MATT: In the other room?

3919
02:51:22.013 --> 02:51:23.013
Nobody yet.

3920
02:51:23.013 --> 02:51:24.766
Nobody that you can see has left your side,

3921
02:51:24.766 --> 02:51:26.393
everyone else is in the chamber.

3922
02:51:26.393 --> 02:51:28.675
TALIESIN: I'm going to just back up a little, I just want to

3923
02:51:28.675 --> 02:51:32.142
make sure everyone's within 30 feet of me.

3924
02:51:32.142 --> 02:51:33.610
MATT: Everyone's within 30 feet of you.

3925
02:51:33.610 --> 02:51:36.058
TALIESIN: All right, then I'm casting-- not that one,

3926
02:51:36.058 --> 02:51:39.225
that's the wrong thing. Where'd it go?

3927
02:51:40.132 --> 02:51:42.955
Where is my Beacon of Hope?

3928
02:51:42.955 --> 02:51:44.588
MATT: Beacon of Hope is an action.

3929
02:51:44.588 --> 02:51:47.444
TALIESIN: I'm casting Beacon of Hope.

3930
02:51:47.444 --> 02:51:52.019
So everybody has

3931
02:51:52.019 --> 02:51:54.050
advantage on wisdom saving throws.

3932
02:51:54.050 --> 02:51:55.643
Except for Nott, sorry.

3933
02:51:55.643 --> 02:51:56.825
SAM: Sure.

3934
02:51:56.825 --> 02:51:58.452
TALIESIN: And death saving throws.

3935
02:51:58.452 --> 02:51:59.999
And whenever you heal,

3936
02:51:59.999 --> 02:52:01.962
you heal maximum number of points.

3937
02:52:01.962 --> 02:52:02.795
LAURA: Tight.

3938
02:52:02.795 --> 02:52:04.364
TALIESIN: No rolling for healing.

3939
02:52:04.364 --> 02:52:05.197
MATT: You got it.

3940
02:52:05.197 --> 02:52:06.197
TALIESIN: All right.

3941
02:52:07.217 --> 02:52:09.740
Yeah, other than that I'm just

3942
02:52:09.740 --> 02:52:12.962
going to just stay ready.

3943
02:52:12.962 --> 02:52:14.945
MATT: All right. Caleb, you're up.

3944
02:52:16.226 --> 02:52:18.754
LIAM: I move along the wall, and as I move

3945
02:52:18.754 --> 02:52:21.971
I whisper harshly: Nott says that there

3946
02:52:21.971 --> 02:52:24.292
are two things hiding in the ceiling.

3947
02:52:24.292 --> 02:52:26.124
And I jam a licorice root in my mouth,

3948
02:52:26.124 --> 02:52:27.879
chew it a bit, wave my hands together

3949
02:52:27.879 --> 02:52:30.316
and cast Haste on Beauregard.

3950
02:52:30.316 --> 02:52:31.807
MATT: Okay.

3951
02:52:31.807 --> 02:52:35.390
So Beau's hasted and you are concentrating.

3952
02:52:38.619 --> 02:52:40.167
You got it.

3953
02:52:40.167 --> 02:52:43.250
SAM: Beauregard ain't no slow-regard!

3954
02:52:44.239 --> 02:52:45.389
TRAVIS: Wow.

3955
02:52:45.389 --> 02:52:46.872
LAURA: Nope.

3956
02:52:46.872 --> 02:52:51.555
TALIESIN: Suddenly, I don't miss Scanlan. That's weird.

3957
02:52:51.555 --> 02:52:54.305
MATT: Out of this corner, let me see.

3958
02:52:57.626 --> 02:52:59.951
Does not seem to be, at the moment,

3959
02:52:59.951 --> 02:53:03.949
taken in by the illusion of Jester's arrival.

3960
02:53:03.949 --> 02:53:05.456
Shifts out of the corner to see who's

3961
02:53:05.456 --> 02:53:07.904
making this ruckus, flying over to this corner

3962
02:53:07.904 --> 02:53:10.987
of the chamber, and glancing through.

3963
02:53:14.104 --> 02:53:17.117
Caleb, I need you to make a wisdom saving throw for me.

3964
02:53:17.117 --> 02:53:19.784
LIAM and TALIESIN: At advantage.

3965
02:53:23.662 --> 02:53:24.579
LIAM: Oh great.

3966
02:53:25.447 --> 02:53:27.201
That is a 26.

3967
02:53:27.201 --> 02:53:28.666
MATT: 26.

3968
02:53:28.666 --> 02:53:29.808
TALIESIN: Had a feeling.

3969
02:53:29.808 --> 02:53:33.641
MATT: Out of the corner of your eye, you notice...

3970
02:53:37.145 --> 02:53:40.281
Close to meta gaming, but sure.

3971
02:53:40.281 --> 02:53:42.279
TALIESIN: He knew what we were getting into.

3972
02:53:42.279 --> 02:53:43.112
MATT: Sure.

3973
02:53:46.268 --> 02:53:49.530
As you finish casting Haste on Beauregard,

3974
02:53:49.530 --> 02:53:52.507
and watch her muscles begin to pulse

3975
02:53:52.507 --> 02:53:54.627
with the adrenaline rushing through her system,

3976
02:53:54.627 --> 02:53:56.175
you glance up and out of the corner of your eye

3977
02:53:56.175 --> 02:53:59.632
you see appear out of the shadows

3978
02:53:59.632 --> 02:54:03.385
this beautiful red, pinkish-skinned

3979
02:54:03.385 --> 02:54:06.772
male humanoid figure that drifts through

3980
02:54:06.772 --> 02:54:11.667
the distant backside of the bedroom area.

3981
02:54:11.667 --> 02:54:13.215
He has leathery red wings that,

3982
02:54:13.215 --> 02:54:15.310
as it pulls back, and as it looks at you

3983
02:54:15.310 --> 02:54:19.257
and just goes, and curls a fingers toward it.

3984
02:54:19.257 --> 02:54:21.089
You feel this presence try and push

3985
02:54:21.089 --> 02:54:22.679
into your brain and for a minute

3986
02:54:22.679 --> 02:54:25.204
your eyes lock onto it and there's

3987
02:54:25.204 --> 02:54:29.077
this drawn sense towards it.

3988
02:54:29.077 --> 02:54:32.133
You just shake it off with your mind for a second.

3989
02:54:32.133 --> 02:54:33.679
No effect.

3990
02:54:33.679 --> 02:54:35.922
It seems to be frustrated with that reveal

3991
02:54:35.922 --> 02:54:38.288
and going to growl and move over

3992
02:54:38.288 --> 02:54:40.202
to this side of the chamber.

3993
02:54:40.202 --> 02:54:43.702
Drifting we'll say up here in this corner.

3994
02:54:44.818 --> 02:54:45.790
All right.

3995
02:54:45.790 --> 02:54:48.806
Ending its turn, that brings us to Yasha's go.

3996
02:54:48.806 --> 02:54:51.457
TRAVIS: Yeah, Yasha will walk up to the doorway,

3997
02:54:51.457 --> 02:54:53.049
seeing everyone sort of hesitate,

3998
02:54:53.049 --> 02:54:55.333
and will post up just on the side

3999
02:54:55.333 --> 02:54:58.222
of the doorway and she will listen. Is there

4000
02:54:58.222 --> 02:55:02.055
any sort of language being spoken in the room?

4001
02:55:03.893 --> 02:55:06.548
MATT: I'll say just hearing over, there's no sound

4002
02:55:06.548 --> 02:55:10.093
other than an angry growl as something seems

4003
02:55:10.093 --> 02:55:14.010
frustrated on the other side of that chamber's door.

4004
02:55:14.010 --> 02:55:17.804
TRAVIS: Did Nott communicate with just Caleb what she saw?

4005
02:55:17.804 --> 02:55:18.824
SAM: Caleb just--

4006
02:55:18.824 --> 02:55:19.722
TRAVIS: Told everybody?

4007
02:55:19.722 --> 02:55:22.816
MATT: Caleb said it very quickly.

4008
02:55:22.816 --> 02:55:24.766
LIAM: Said two things in the ceiling.

4009
02:55:24.766 --> 02:55:25.599
TRAVIS: Okay.

4010
02:55:26.805 --> 02:55:29.781
That's her turn.

4011
02:55:29.781 --> 02:55:31.165
MATT: Okay.

4012
02:55:31.165 --> 02:55:33.980
End of Yasha's turn. Yasha's glancing up.

4013
02:55:33.980 --> 02:55:37.198
Over the doorway that's been pushed open,

4014
02:55:37.198 --> 02:55:40.373
these clawed fingers curl over.

4015
02:55:41.645 --> 02:55:44.297
These glowing yellow eyes peer over

4016
02:55:44.297 --> 02:55:49.009
from this bright red, voluminous lips

4017
02:55:49.009 --> 02:55:52.949
of some female, almost tieflingesque,

4018
02:55:52.949 --> 02:55:55.459
from the experiences you've had,

4019
02:55:55.459 --> 02:55:58.752
definitely a demonic twist, but beautiful.

4020
02:55:58.752 --> 02:56:02.461
Glances over towards Yasha and just gives a wink.

4021
02:56:02.461 --> 02:56:05.164
Yasha can make a wisdom saving throw for me, please.

4022
02:56:05.164 --> 02:56:06.164
SAM, MATT, TALIESIN: At advantage.

4023
02:56:08.101 --> 02:56:09.851
TRAVIS: These suck for her.

4024
02:56:10.913 --> 02:56:11.933
MARISHA: That was good, though.

4025
02:56:11.933 --> 02:56:13.279
TRAVIS: 16.

4026
02:56:13.279 --> 02:56:14.647
MATT: Fuck man, okay.

4027
02:56:14.647 --> 02:56:16.066
TRAVIS: 18 and a 17 minus one.

4028
02:56:16.066 --> 02:56:16.899
MATT: This is--

4029
02:56:16.899 --> 02:56:18.390
TALIESIN: We're going ghost hunting, man.

4030
02:56:18.390 --> 02:56:19.856
MATT: Yeah, it's cool, it's cool.

4031
02:56:19.856 --> 02:56:21.121
MARISHA: It's what Caduceus is good at.

4032
02:56:21.121 --> 02:56:22.825
MATT: Yeah. These aren't ghosts.

4033
02:56:22.825 --> 02:56:24.998
LIAM: Stupid D&amp;D characters with their skills.

4034
02:56:24.998 --> 02:56:26.994
MATT: Yeah, no. I'll smash you later, it's fine.

4035
02:56:26.994 --> 02:56:28.102
TALIESIN: I know.

4036
02:56:29.070 --> 02:56:33.828
MATT: She glances back in an angry, frustrated stare.

4037
02:56:35.632 --> 02:56:38.358
The creature, the female entity that's

4038
02:56:38.358 --> 02:56:41.290
staring out the doorway assesses the moment,

4039
02:56:41.290 --> 02:56:44.171
looks at the rest of you, and goes, "Aye,

4040
02:56:44.171 --> 02:56:46.671
you're no fun," and pushes off.

4041
02:56:48.168 --> 02:56:50.777
Drifts over around this corner in a wide arc

4042
02:56:50.777 --> 02:56:52.490
and disappears to the other side,

4043
02:56:52.490 --> 02:56:53.591
you won't even see her.

4044
02:56:53.591 --> 02:56:55.504
MARISHA: Do I get an action? Is she within my range?

4045
02:56:55.504 --> 02:56:58.171
MATT: Nope, she's avoiding the door.

4046
02:56:59.701 --> 02:57:02.352
That ends their go.

4047
02:57:02.352 --> 02:57:03.769
Fjord, you're up.

4048
02:57:06.020 --> 02:57:08.887
TRAVIS: Yeah, yep. Cool.

4049
02:57:08.887 --> 02:57:10.870
Who's going to be the first one to go in the room, huh?

4050
02:57:10.870 --> 02:57:12.254
Who's going to be the first?

4051
02:57:12.254 --> 02:57:13.270
TALIESIN: I say we send a cleric in there,

4052
02:57:13.270 --> 02:57:14.103
that's always funny.

4053
02:57:14.103 --> 02:57:19.081
TRAVIS: I'll cast (tongue waggling)

4054
02:57:20.318 --> 02:57:23.485
LIAM: Is that an action or a bonus action?

4055
02:57:24.392 --> 02:57:27.209
SAM: (exaggerated German accent) Eldritch blast.

4056
02:57:27.209 --> 02:57:29.368
TRAVIS: Yeah fuck it, why not, let's have some fun.

4057
02:57:29.368 --> 02:57:31.325
I'll go into the room.

4058
02:57:34.141 --> 02:57:37.613
LAURA: Don't worry Fjord, I will protect you.

4059
02:57:37.613 --> 02:57:38.746
MATT: That's 20-foot there.

4060
02:57:38.746 --> 02:57:42.459
TRAVIS: Thank you, and I will cast Shadow of Moil on myself.

4061
02:57:42.459 --> 02:57:44.458
SAM: What is that?

4062
02:57:44.458 --> 02:57:46.619
TRAVIS: I summon the falchion, and you see

4063
02:57:46.619 --> 02:57:48.980
these black flames ignite at

4064
02:57:48.980 --> 02:57:52.317
my feet and spiral up around Fjord.

4065
02:57:52.317 --> 02:57:53.662
MARISHA: That's dope.

4066
02:57:53.662 --> 02:57:55.245
SAM: When I hear moil.

4067
02:57:56.517 --> 02:57:58.957
My penis shrivels up.

4068
02:57:58.957 --> 02:58:01.582
(laughter)

4069
02:58:01.582 --> 02:58:02.956
MATT: All right.

4070
02:58:02.956 --> 02:58:04.710
As Fjord steps through, pushing

4071
02:58:04.710 --> 02:58:06.668
past the hasted Beau, you watch as

4072
02:58:06.668 --> 02:58:09.198
the already low-lit chamber darkens

4073
02:58:09.198 --> 02:58:11.887
around his torso, and where the shadow

4074
02:58:11.887 --> 02:58:14.006
seems to gather and press itself

4075
02:58:14.006 --> 02:58:15.964
around the edges of the armor,

4076
02:58:15.964 --> 02:58:19.060
you see these tendrils drift off,

4077
02:58:19.060 --> 02:58:21.590
like the shadow itself is leaving

4078
02:58:21.590 --> 02:58:23.179
these dripping tentacles that then

4079
02:58:23.179 --> 02:58:26.074
dissipate into a dark dust and then reform

4080
02:58:26.074 --> 02:58:28.192
across his body as he steps into the chamber.

4081
02:58:28.192 --> 02:58:29.413
LAURA: That sounds really fucking cool.

4082
02:58:29.413 --> 02:58:30.552
MATT: That's your action?

4083
02:58:30.552 --> 02:58:32.264
TRAVIS: That's my action.

4084
02:58:32.264 --> 02:58:36.681
With my bonus action,

4085
02:58:36.681 --> 02:58:40.862
can I see either of the two entities in the room?

4086
02:58:40.862 --> 02:58:42.452
MATT: That one had no opportunity to stealth,

4087
02:58:42.452 --> 02:58:43.795
so now that you glance you can see,

4088
02:58:43.795 --> 02:58:45.136
now that one's curled up in the corner,

4089
02:58:45.136 --> 02:58:46.807
perched up, arms and legs there,

4090
02:58:46.807 --> 02:58:48.803
and the wings themselves are open

4091
02:58:48.803 --> 02:58:50.553
and curved around the interior.

4092
02:58:50.553 --> 02:58:51.652
It's looking straight at you

4093
02:58:51.652 --> 02:58:52.958
as you enter the chamber watching--

4094
02:58:52.958 --> 02:58:54.056
TRAVIS: This one right here?

4095
02:58:54.056 --> 02:58:56.050
MATT: This one right here, one across the way.

4096
02:58:56.050 --> 02:58:59.927
Eyes are on you. The bugbear's still asleep in the bed.

4097
02:58:59.927 --> 02:59:01.314
The one across the way is

4098
02:59:01.314 --> 02:59:03.269
similarly perched up, though less aggressive

4099
02:59:03.269 --> 02:59:05.880
and more gargoylesque just watching you enter.

4100
02:59:05.880 --> 02:59:08.347
TRAVIS: Interesting. I will...

4101
02:59:09.706 --> 02:59:12.478
Yeah, I'm going to save it. That's it, that's my turn.

4102
02:59:12.478 --> 02:59:13.702
MATT: Okay.

4103
02:59:13.702 --> 02:59:16.223
That brings us to Nott. You're up first.

4104
02:59:16.223 --> 02:59:18.834
SAM: Oh, my go. Okay.

4105
02:59:18.834 --> 02:59:23.775
I will fire my-- is Fjord in melee range?

4106
02:59:23.775 --> 02:59:25.108
Well, I'm still hidden, so I will

4107
02:59:25.108 --> 02:59:27.023
take a sneak attack, I think.

4108
02:59:27.023 --> 02:59:28.530
MATT: Possibly, against which one?

4109
02:59:28.530 --> 02:59:29.878
SAM: On the one next to Fjord.

4110
02:59:29.878 --> 02:59:31.378
MATT: Sure, go for it.

4111
02:59:32.895 --> 02:59:35.145
SAM: Pretty good, pretty good.

4112
02:59:36.402 --> 02:59:39.544
Let's say that that's a 28 to hit.

4113
02:59:39.544 --> 02:59:42.544
MATT: 28 to hit, that'll definitely hit.

4114
02:59:43.462 --> 02:59:46.151
SAM: That deals, is it sneak attack?

4115
02:59:46.151 --> 02:59:48.269
MATT: It is sneak attack; it was not aware of your presence.

4116
02:59:48.269 --> 02:59:49.102
SAM: Great.

4117
02:59:53.241 --> 02:59:56.652
26 points of damage.

4118
02:59:56.652 --> 02:59:57.485
MATT: Nice!

4119
02:59:59.551 --> 03:00:00.634
SAM: Then...

4120
03:00:02.769 --> 03:00:04.687
Does it see me now, I guess?

4121
03:00:04.687 --> 03:00:05.909
MATT: It is very aware of your presence

4122
03:00:05.909 --> 03:00:09.680
as you leap up behind and fire the bolt.

4123
03:00:09.680 --> 03:00:11.002
(hisses)

4124
03:00:11.002 --> 03:00:12.791
As she hisses at you, you watch as the

4125
03:00:12.791 --> 03:00:15.521
very beautiful, slender, smooth features

4126
03:00:15.521 --> 03:00:17.721
of the face momentarily stretch

4127
03:00:17.721 --> 03:00:20.124
into this awful demonic visage

4128
03:00:20.124 --> 03:00:22.853
before retracting once more.

4129
03:00:22.853 --> 03:00:25.056
SAM: Should I help the bugbear, or should I--

4130
03:00:25.056 --> 03:00:26.523
I don't care about the bugbear.

4131
03:00:26.523 --> 03:00:27.908
LAURA: Attack!

4132
03:00:27.908 --> 03:00:29.737
SAM: I will bonus action hide.

4133
03:00:29.737 --> 03:00:32.873
I'm just going to dive back down under the window.

4134
03:00:32.873 --> 03:00:34.298
MATT: Go for it.

4135
03:00:34.298 --> 03:00:35.381
SAM: Stealth 22.

4136
03:00:36.784 --> 03:00:38.044
MATT: 22.

4137
03:00:38.044 --> 03:00:40.695
All righty, so you believe that you are stealthy.

4138
03:00:40.695 --> 03:00:41.715
SAM: I do believe that.

4139
03:00:41.715 --> 03:00:43.469
MATT: That finishes Nott's go. Jester you're up.

4140
03:00:43.469 --> 03:00:46.319
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to send my duplicate

4141
03:00:46.319 --> 03:00:49.652
forward to the guy hiding in the corner.

4142
03:00:50.638 --> 03:00:51.471
MATT: Over there?

4143
03:00:51.471 --> 03:00:52.348
LAURA: Uh-huh.

4144
03:00:52.348 --> 03:00:53.778
MATT: The duplicate's going to have--

4145
03:00:53.778 --> 03:00:55.125
he's up in the corner of the room

4146
03:00:55.125 --> 03:00:56.878
about ten feet up. It can try and attempt

4147
03:00:56.878 --> 03:01:00.869
to leap and cast a spell, if it wants to.

4148
03:01:00.869 --> 03:01:01.702
LAURA: Okay.

4149
03:01:03.274 --> 03:01:06.375
It's going to-- isn't it-- I mean, does the duplicate

4150
03:01:06.375 --> 03:01:08.818
walk on the ground or if I want to move it up?

4151
03:01:08.818 --> 03:01:10.571
MATT: It doesn't have a fly speed, so it does.

4152
03:01:10.571 --> 03:01:11.404
LAURA: Okay.

4153
03:01:13.262 --> 03:01:15.429
Is the girl on the ground?

4154
03:01:16.520 --> 03:01:18.396
MATT: No, she's up in the corner.

4155
03:01:18.396 --> 03:01:19.660
To be a little more specific,

4156
03:01:19.660 --> 03:01:20.841
It's adjacent to Fjord, technically,

4157
03:01:20.841 --> 03:01:23.040
but she's more up in the corner perched.

4158
03:01:23.040 --> 03:01:24.222
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

4159
03:01:24.222 --> 03:01:25.567
Then yeah, the duplicate's going to jump up

4160
03:01:25.567 --> 03:01:27.355
and try to tap the guy on the foot

4161
03:01:27.355 --> 03:01:30.614
and cast Inflict Wounds at 3rd-level.

4162
03:01:30.614 --> 03:01:32.282
MATT: Go for it.
SAM: Whoa!

4163
03:01:32.282 --> 03:01:33.875
TALIESIN: Wow.

4164
03:01:33.875 --> 03:01:35.792
LIAM: Toenail's coming off.

4165
03:01:37.016 --> 03:01:38.117
SAM: Look at that roll.

4166
03:01:38.117 --> 03:01:39.707
LAURA: Woo!

4167
03:01:39.707 --> 03:01:40.767
TALIESIN: That was indecisive.

4168
03:01:40.767 --> 03:01:43.133
LAURA and MATT: 15 plus eight.

4169
03:01:43.133 --> 03:01:44.722
MATT: Nice, that definitely hits.

4170
03:01:44.722 --> 03:01:47.578
LAURA: That's 5d10.

4171
03:01:47.578 --> 03:01:48.411
SAM: 5d10?!

4172
03:01:49.617 --> 03:01:52.441
What?! That's illegal.

4173
03:01:52.441 --> 03:01:55.295
LAURA: 17, 19, 25.

4174
03:01:55.295 --> 03:01:56.469
TALIESIN: That's some great dice.

4175
03:01:56.469 --> 03:01:58.141
SAM: That's four, wait there's more.

4176
03:01:58.141 --> 03:01:58.974
LAURA: Aw. 26.

4177
03:01:59.851 --> 03:02:03.334
MATT: 26 points of necrotic damage. Woo!

4178
03:02:03.334 --> 03:02:04.902
Not fun.

4179
03:02:04.902 --> 03:02:06.937
As the duplicate reaches up and grasps

4180
03:02:06.937 --> 03:02:09.173
at the toe, the entity is focused currently

4181
03:02:09.173 --> 03:02:11.454
on this shadowy form that is gathering

4182
03:02:11.454 --> 03:02:14.347
around Fjord's body, and glances down

4183
03:02:14.347 --> 03:02:16.099
just in time to see the illusion move

4184
03:02:16.099 --> 03:02:18.507
and looks angrily down before,

4185
03:02:18.507 --> 03:02:21.358
taps the toe, and withdraws even

4186
03:02:21.358 --> 03:02:23.888
further up, Exorcist crawling up

4187
03:02:23.888 --> 03:02:26.455
into the corner even further, hitting the ceiling

4188
03:02:26.455 --> 03:02:29.264
which slightly shifts upward

4189
03:02:29.264 --> 03:02:31.302
causing dust to settle from above.

4190
03:02:31.302 --> 03:02:32.972
LAURA: Right as he does that, I use my bonus action

4191
03:02:32.972 --> 03:02:34.644
to swing the spiritual weapon up

4192
03:02:34.644 --> 03:02:36.396
and smack him up into the corner.

4193
03:02:36.396 --> 03:02:38.601
MATT: All right, spiritual weapon shifts up and now

4194
03:02:38.601 --> 03:02:41.862
pincer attacking both illusionary Jester and the

4195
03:02:41.862 --> 03:02:43.775
spiritual weapon going towards the center.

4196
03:02:43.775 --> 03:02:45.898
LAURA: That probably doesn't hit, 11.

4197
03:02:45.898 --> 03:02:47.776
MATT: 11 does not hit.

4198
03:02:47.776 --> 03:02:49.694
As it swings towards it, it actually ducks

4199
03:02:49.694 --> 03:02:51.247
out of the way. The wings lifting

4200
03:02:51.247 --> 03:02:53.239
with the cushion of air sending dust

4201
03:02:53.239 --> 03:02:56.420
and loose hair that's been shed by

4202
03:02:56.420 --> 03:02:58.053
the bugbear to drift up from the floor

4203
03:02:58.053 --> 03:02:59.522
of the chamber, and in doing so

4204
03:02:59.522 --> 03:03:01.234
the spiritual weapon swings ahead

4205
03:03:01.234 --> 03:03:02.656
and actually slams into one of the

4206
03:03:02.656 --> 03:03:04.528
top boards that supports the ceiling,

4207
03:03:04.528 --> 03:03:07.423
you watch as the wood cracks from the impact.

4208
03:03:07.423 --> 03:03:09.828
LAURA: I'm going to scooch back.

4209
03:03:09.828 --> 03:03:10.661
MATT: Scooch back here?

4210
03:03:10.661 --> 03:03:11.494
LAURA: Yeah.

4211
03:03:11.494 --> 03:03:12.433
MATT: All right.

4212
03:03:12.433 --> 03:03:14.063
LAURA: And into the corner.

4213
03:03:14.063 --> 03:03:14.896
MATT: This way?

4214
03:03:14.896 --> 03:03:15.729
LAURA: Yeah.

4215
03:03:15.729 --> 03:03:16.739
MATT: All right, step onto the table to do that.

4216
03:03:16.739 --> 03:03:17.572
LAURA: Okay, yeah.

4217
03:03:17.572 --> 03:03:19.914
MATT: You clamor up onto the dining room table

4218
03:03:19.914 --> 03:03:22.727
and step off in the corner holding yourself there.

4219
03:03:22.727 --> 03:03:24.233
LAURA: Kind of like this.

4220
03:03:24.233 --> 03:03:26.145
MATT: There you go. That's Jester's turn.

4221
03:03:26.145 --> 03:03:27.370
Next up is Beau. What are you doing?

4222
03:03:27.370 --> 03:03:29.776
MARISHA: I'm going to do a little roll past Fjord,

4223
03:03:29.776 --> 03:03:33.651
very epically, to get into the room.

4224
03:03:35.157 --> 03:03:37.686
Then I'm going to pop up and I'm going to

4225
03:03:37.686 --> 03:03:40.133
hit the one next to Fjord first.

4226
03:03:40.133 --> 03:03:43.641
MATT: You roll past into the chamber.

4227
03:03:43.641 --> 03:03:45.798
You've seen it peek out and then dash into

4228
03:03:45.798 --> 03:03:47.306
the corner as you rush, and you have enough

4229
03:03:47.306 --> 03:03:49.706
movement to glance up, see it adjust, and then leap

4230
03:03:49.706 --> 03:03:52.393
to try and grasp or attack it. What are you going to do?

4231
03:03:52.393 --> 03:03:54.717
MARISHA: Vault off the wall a little bit,

4232
03:03:54.717 --> 03:03:58.015
and I'm going to go for a kidney shout.

4233
03:03:58.015 --> 03:03:58.913
TRAVIS: Kidney shout?

4234
03:03:58.913 --> 03:04:01.069
MARISHA: Kidney shout!

4235
03:04:01.069 --> 03:04:02.616
The extra action, does that mean I get

4236
03:04:02.616 --> 03:04:06.015
two additional attacks with haste or just one?

4237
03:04:06.015 --> 03:04:07.196
MATT: No, it's one weapon attack.

4238
03:04:07.196 --> 03:04:08.624
MARISHA: One weapon attack, okay.

4239
03:04:08.624 --> 03:04:11.354
First two attacks.

4240
03:04:11.354 --> 03:04:13.394
That's a natural 19 for the first one

4241
03:04:13.394 --> 03:04:16.492
and a nine for the other making it a 17.

4242
03:04:16.492 --> 03:04:17.510
MATT: Yeah, both hit.

4243
03:04:17.510 --> 03:04:18.343
MARISHA: Okay.

4244
03:04:20.119 --> 03:04:22.738
I said my elbow, I'll do these with,

4245
03:04:22.738 --> 03:04:24.041
I probably need magical anyway,

4246
03:04:24.041 --> 03:04:26.278
I'm going to do these with my fists.

4247
03:04:26.278 --> 03:04:30.702
Okay, ten damage, and then another six for 16.

4248
03:04:30.702 --> 03:04:33.966
One more attack with haste, that's 18.

4249
03:04:33.966 --> 03:04:36.084
MATT: 18 hits.

4250
03:04:36.084 --> 03:04:38.196
MARISHA: And eight damage.

4251
03:04:38.196 --> 03:04:40.233
MATT: Eight damage, nice.

4252
03:04:40.233 --> 03:04:41.737
MARISHA: Flurry of Blows.

4253
03:04:41.737 --> 03:04:42.737
MATT: All right.

4254
03:04:45.457 --> 03:04:47.295
MARISHA: Natural 17 for the first one

4255
03:04:47.295 --> 03:04:49.572
and a two for the other one.

4256
03:04:49.572 --> 03:04:52.405
MATT: The two misses, but the 17 does.

4257
03:04:54.444 --> 03:04:57.111
MARISHA: Ten damage and Extract Aspects.

4258
03:04:59.214 --> 03:05:04.214
LAURA and MARISHA: Extract Aspects!

4259
03:05:04.268 --> 03:05:06.143
MARSHA: I grab her wrist and I get her

4260
03:05:06.143 --> 03:05:08.377
in a wristlock and try to concentrate

4261
03:05:08.377 --> 03:05:10.126
on her pulse and see what I can determine.

4262
03:05:10.126 --> 03:05:12.772
MATT: As you do that, you feel your ki press

4263
03:05:12.772 --> 03:05:15.947
into this creature, and as your life essence

4264
03:05:15.947 --> 03:05:17.658
merges with it, there's a slight

4265
03:05:17.658 --> 03:05:19.770
burning sensation from the impact,

4266
03:05:19.770 --> 03:05:22.254
you instinctually withdraw, but as you do,

4267
03:05:22.254 --> 03:05:25.587
you also get a sense of its physicality.

4268
03:05:26.856 --> 03:05:29.544
It has no vulnerabilities or condition immunities,

4269
03:05:29.544 --> 03:05:31.090
or damage immunities, but it is resistant

4270
03:05:31.090 --> 03:05:33.651
to cold, fire, lightning, and poison.

4271
03:05:33.651 --> 03:05:34.651
MARISHA: Resistant.

4272
03:05:36.912 --> 03:05:39.679
To cold, fire, lightning, poison.

4273
03:05:39.679 --> 03:05:41.434
MATT: And bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing

4274
03:05:41.434 --> 03:05:43.102
from non-magical weapons, which you notice

4275
03:05:43.102 --> 03:05:45.466
as your unarmed strikes are not quite

4276
03:05:45.466 --> 03:05:48.965
doing as much damage as you hoped.

4277
03:05:48.965 --> 03:05:52.104
MARISHA: No, my punches are magical.

4278
03:05:52.104 --> 03:05:53.369
MATT: Oh that's right, they are!

4279
03:05:53.369 --> 03:05:56.542
MARISHA: That's why I decided to not attack with the staff.

4280
03:05:56.542 --> 03:05:58.086
MATT: You're right, you're fine.

4281
03:05:58.086 --> 03:05:59.349
MARISHA: So that was all full damage.

4282
03:05:59.349 --> 03:06:01.181
MATT: Yeah, you're good.

4283
03:06:01.181 --> 03:06:02.014
MARISHA: Okay.

4284
03:06:03.589 --> 03:06:05.180
I just turn to the room and I say

4285
03:06:05.180 --> 03:06:08.356
they're resistant to a lot of shit!

4286
03:06:08.356 --> 03:06:09.189
MATT: There you go.

4287
03:06:09.189 --> 03:06:10.919
SAM: Cool, thanks.

4288
03:06:10.919 --> 03:06:11.752
TRAVIS: Helps a lot.

4289
03:06:11.752 --> 03:06:13.002
LIAM: High fantasy.

4290
03:06:15.757 --> 03:06:17.234
SMA: Ghost puncher!

4291
03:06:17.234 --> 03:06:18.957
MARISHA: Based on the quickness of the statement,

4292
03:06:18.957 --> 03:06:20.122
the vagueness of the statement,

4293
03:06:20.122 --> 03:06:21.402
you probably didn't learn much yet,

4294
03:06:21.402 --> 03:06:22.741
but we'll move on from that.

4295
03:06:22.741 --> 03:06:23.905
All right that finishes your go, Beau?

4296
03:06:23.905 --> 03:06:24.738
MARISHA: Yeah.

4297
03:06:24.738 --> 03:06:25.964
MATT: Caduceus, you're up.

4298
03:06:25.964 --> 03:06:27.772
TALIESIN: I'm going to also come around

4299
03:06:27.772 --> 03:06:29.630
so I can see into the room.

4300
03:06:29.630 --> 03:06:33.580
If I can get in front of Jester,

4301
03:06:33.580 --> 03:06:36.425
like not quite that close, but like there.

4302
03:06:36.425 --> 03:06:38.116
Can I see anything that's

4303
03:06:38.116 --> 03:06:39.786
going on, or can I not really--

4304
03:06:39.786 --> 03:06:43.086
MATT: You glance and you can see Fjord,

4305
03:06:43.086 --> 03:06:45.452
some weird curling shadows,

4306
03:06:45.452 --> 03:06:47.684
and a little bit of Jester's illusion and that's it.

4307
03:06:47.684 --> 03:06:52.122
TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to send my beetles in there

4308
03:06:52.122 --> 03:06:53.954
because I don't think that's a good room for me.

4309
03:06:53.954 --> 03:06:54.787
MATT: Okay.

4310
03:06:57.171 --> 03:06:58.678
TALIESIN: That's a bonus action,

4311
03:06:58.678 --> 03:07:01.206
I'm going to send my beetles.

4312
03:07:01.206 --> 03:07:03.406
I'm going to activate the blightstaff.

4313
03:07:03.406 --> 03:07:04.907
MATT: The beetles appear in there.

4314
03:07:04.907 --> 03:07:07.835
Visually you have nowhere to send them.

4315
03:07:07.835 --> 03:07:09.670
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm just shooting them all the way

4316
03:07:09.670 --> 03:07:13.125
into the farthest reaches of the room that I can.

4317
03:07:13.125 --> 03:07:14.021
MATT: That you can see?

4318
03:07:14.021 --> 03:07:15.000
TALIESIN: Yeah, that I can see.

4319
03:07:15.000 --> 03:07:16.425
MATT: All right, so the beetles fly down

4320
03:07:16.425 --> 03:07:19.680
and begin to envelop the nightstand

4321
03:07:19.680 --> 03:07:22.245
structure next to the sleeping bugbear.

4322
03:07:22.245 --> 03:07:24.885
The bugbear you can see is like,

4323
03:07:24.885 --> 03:07:26.913
(shocked grunts)

4324
03:07:26.913 --> 03:07:28.340
Looks over and just sees this cloud

4325
03:07:28.340 --> 03:07:31.395
of beetles and land next to it.

4326
03:07:31.395 --> 03:07:33.149
TALIESIN: Then for fun, if I can, if I can take

4327
03:07:33.149 --> 03:07:36.120
a copper piece and cast Light spell on that

4328
03:07:36.120 --> 03:07:39.055
and throw that in there. Is it dark in there?

4329
03:07:39.055 --> 03:07:42.191
MATT: There's very faint ember burning on the walls.

4330
03:07:42.191 --> 03:07:44.407
TALIESINL I'll light this room up.

4331
03:07:44.407 --> 03:07:45.730
I'm going to take a cooper piece and cast

4332
03:07:45.730 --> 03:07:47.135
Light on it and toss it in the room.

4333
03:07:47.135 --> 03:07:51.712
MATT: This single coin comes lobbing into the room,

4334
03:07:51.712 --> 03:07:53.276
end over end, and the suddenly

4335
03:07:53.276 --> 03:07:55.351
releases this bright torchlight

4336
03:07:55.351 --> 03:07:57.810
as it lands cling-a-ling in the corner.

4337
03:07:57.810 --> 03:08:00.375
Definitely wakes up the bugbear, Umadon,

4338
03:08:00.375 --> 03:08:03.265
and the room is now well-lit.

4339
03:08:03.265 --> 03:08:05.826
Now you can see, other than Fjord,

4340
03:08:05.826 --> 03:08:08.393
which the shadows still seem to cling to him,

4341
03:08:08.393 --> 03:08:10.224
it's this weird void of light

4342
03:08:10.224 --> 03:08:11.814
in the space where he's standing,

4343
03:08:11.814 --> 03:08:14.828
but now between the two creatures that are

4344
03:08:14.828 --> 03:08:16.728
up in the corners of the wall you can see

4345
03:08:16.728 --> 03:08:18.236
the long shadows, their wings and their

4346
03:08:18.236 --> 03:08:19.818
bodies are casting across the ceiling

4347
03:08:19.818 --> 03:08:21.445
in the area of the wall around them.

4348
03:08:21.445 --> 03:08:24.424
They both hiss over in the direction of this coin.

4349
03:08:24.424 --> 03:08:25.606
TALIESIN: I'll back up as much as I can

4350
03:08:25.606 --> 03:08:27.234
with what's remaining of my move.

4351
03:08:27.234 --> 03:08:28.211
MATT: You only got about five feet.

4352
03:08:28.211 --> 03:08:29.349
TALIESIN: Yeah, I only got five feet.

4353
03:08:29.349 --> 03:08:32.039
MATT: That finishes your go, Caduceus?

4354
03:08:32.039 --> 03:08:32.872
TALIESIN: Yep yep yep.

4355
03:08:32.872 --> 03:08:33.866
MATT: Caleb, you're up.

4356
03:08:33.866 --> 03:08:35.576
LIAM: Okay, so walking towards the door

4357
03:08:35.576 --> 03:08:38.833
I pull an adder's stomach out of my pocket

4358
03:08:38.833 --> 03:08:42.621
and draw it back and a shimmering

4359
03:08:42.621 --> 03:08:45.143
green arrow appears next to me

4360
03:08:45.143 --> 03:08:47.669
and I let it go towards the fuckboy

4361
03:08:47.669 --> 03:08:51.416
in the upper corner on that side.

4362
03:08:51.416 --> 03:08:52.759
MATT: Roll an attack.

4363
03:08:52.759 --> 03:08:54.482
SAM: Adder's stomach?

4364
03:08:54.482 --> 03:08:57.949
LIAM: 14 plus, that is-- shite.

4365
03:08:57.949 --> 03:09:00.963
Shite, shite, shite.

4366
03:09:00.963 --> 03:09:02.526
19 to hit.

4367
03:09:02.526 --> 03:09:03.786
MATT: 19 does hit, yeah.

4368
03:09:03.786 --> 03:09:07.394
LIAM: Okay, and then damage. What did I do?!

4369
03:09:08.348 --> 03:09:10.773
D&amp;D Beyond is 4d4.

4370
03:09:13.072 --> 03:09:14.865
Okay, so it takes 4d4 acid damage

4371
03:09:14.865 --> 03:09:16.325
immediately and then some more

4372
03:09:16.325 --> 03:09:17.669
at the end of its next turn, so it gets

4373
03:09:17.669 --> 03:09:22.069
two, four, six, ten points of acid damage.

4374
03:09:22.069 --> 03:09:24.147
MATT: Nice.

4375
03:09:24.147 --> 03:09:26.225
You release it. It's hissing at

4376
03:09:26.225 --> 03:09:28.587
the gold coin, the light that's emerging from it.

4377
03:09:28.587 --> 03:09:29.892
It doesn't have a chance to see you

4378
03:09:29.892 --> 03:09:31.316
as you enter the doorway as you release

4379
03:09:31.316 --> 03:09:35.226
this arcane arrow of condensed greenish energy.

4380
03:09:35.226 --> 03:09:37.265
It flies forward and bursts across

4381
03:09:37.265 --> 03:09:40.006
its shoulders and chest.

4382
03:09:40.006 --> 03:09:42.973
Acid begins to burn and scar across its demonic flesh.

4383
03:09:42.973 --> 03:09:45.053
It tries to rub it off with its hands,

4384
03:09:45.053 --> 03:09:46.679
but then it burns its hand, and its wings

4385
03:09:46.679 --> 03:09:49.649
are now keeping it aloft as it's focused on

4386
03:09:49.649 --> 03:09:52.495
the pain of that's now burning into its body.

4387
03:09:52.495 --> 03:09:53.921
LIAM: I will use the last five to ten

4388
03:09:53.921 --> 03:09:55.839
of my movement to just swing like a door

4389
03:09:55.839 --> 03:09:59.409
and press myself out of its view in this room.

4390
03:09:59.409 --> 03:10:02.064
No, next to Yasha against the wall.

4391
03:10:02.064 --> 03:10:03.481
Out of its sight.

4392
03:10:04.326 --> 03:10:05.159
Done.

4393
03:10:05.159 --> 03:10:06.159
MATT: All right.

4394
03:10:07.584 --> 03:10:10.676
That finishes your go.

4395
03:10:10.676 --> 03:10:13.041
Both of these creatures, now one burning.

4396
03:10:13.041 --> 03:10:15.770
The male figure up in the corner looks over

4397
03:10:15.770 --> 03:10:17.275
at the other one and there's a moment that

4398
03:10:17.275 --> 03:10:20.536
they both go, and look and nod to each other.

4399
03:10:20.536 --> 03:10:22.858
You watch as the male figure, his body

4400
03:10:22.858 --> 03:10:25.178
suddenly returns to that somewhat

4401
03:10:25.178 --> 03:10:28.636
ghostly, ethereal blue tint to it.

4402
03:10:28.636 --> 03:10:31.283
The acid just falls off of its body

4403
03:10:31.283 --> 03:10:33.160
and plummets, hitting the boxes

4404
03:10:33.160 --> 03:10:35.684
and the ground of this chamber.

4405
03:10:35.684 --> 03:10:37.641
The wood begins to slowly burn

4406
03:10:37.641 --> 03:10:40.168
and wither away from beneath it.

4407
03:10:40.168 --> 03:10:43.918
It begins to move and shift out of this door.

4408
03:10:44.868 --> 03:10:47.310
MARISHA: Do I get an attack of opportunity on it?

4409
03:10:47.310 --> 03:10:48.143
MATT: Yeah, go for it.

4410
03:10:48.143 --> 03:10:49.344
Roll an attack.

4411
03:10:49.344 --> 03:10:50.844
MARISHA: Sentinel attack.

4412
03:10:51.870 --> 03:10:52.703
Fuck.

4413
03:10:53.541 --> 03:10:54.434
12.

4414
03:10:54.434 --> 03:10:59.154
MATT: You swing and your fist passes through its body.

4415
03:10:59.154 --> 03:11:00.214
No effect.

4416
03:11:00.214 --> 03:11:01.599
LIAM: Because of the new form,

4417
03:11:01.599 --> 03:11:05.224
I assume invulnerable to acid now.

4418
03:11:05.224 --> 03:11:06.815
MATT: The acid seemed to pass through its body

4419
03:11:06.815 --> 03:11:09.582
and is no longer taking the ongoing damage.

4420
03:11:09.582 --> 03:11:12.749
With that, it moves out of sight.

4421
03:11:15.334 --> 03:11:18.386
TALIESIN: Did Nott get an attack of opportunity on that?

4422
03:11:18.386 --> 03:11:19.975
SAM: No, I'm across the room.

4423
03:11:19.975 --> 03:11:22.778
TALIESIN: Oh you're the other way, okay, never mind.

4424
03:11:22.778 --> 03:11:24.365
MATT: With that, it's Yasha's go.

4425
03:11:24.365 --> 03:11:25.586
TRAVIS: Oh the other one doesn't go as well?

4426
03:11:25.586 --> 03:11:26.419
Just that one?

4427
03:11:26.419 --> 03:11:27.412
MATT: Yasha's in-between the two.

4428
03:11:27.412 --> 03:11:28.836
Based on initiatives.

4429
03:11:28.836 --> 03:11:30.462
TRAVIS: Yasha will come inside the room

4430
03:11:30.462 --> 03:11:32.825
and unleash the Magician's Judge

4431
03:11:32.825 --> 03:11:37.308
at the other one that's up in the corner.

4432
03:11:37.308 --> 03:11:39.348
MATT: Currently Yasha can't get to it.

4433
03:11:39.348 --> 03:11:42.196
Beau and you are blocking spaces to get within melee.

4434
03:11:42.196 --> 03:11:43.663
TRAVIS: Oh that's unfortunate.

4435
03:11:43.663 --> 03:11:44.496
MATT: It is.

4436
03:11:45.780 --> 03:11:49.101
She busts into the chamber and it's too crowded.

4437
03:11:49.101 --> 03:11:53.399
TRAVIS: She'll hold her attack.

4438
03:11:53.399 --> 03:11:54.782
And that's her turn.

4439
03:11:54.782 --> 03:11:57.957
She would like to, no, she's not going to rage.

4440
03:11:57.957 --> 03:11:59.505
Yeah, fuck it, she would like to rage.

4441
03:11:59.505 --> 03:12:01.461
MATT: So she comes out of the corner angrily.

4442
03:12:01.461 --> 03:12:04.557
Grrr, bursts into a rage, and having

4443
03:12:04.557 --> 03:12:06.065
the weapon at the ready preparing

4444
03:12:06.065 --> 03:12:08.102
to come in close enough for a big

4445
03:12:08.102 --> 03:12:11.108
ol' swing away strike, all right.

4446
03:12:11.108 --> 03:12:12.735
Now comes the other creature's turn.

4447
03:12:12.735 --> 03:12:14.284
Watching that one vanish, the other one

4448
03:12:14.284 --> 03:12:17.340
sees Yasha at the ready, you below,

4449
03:12:17.340 --> 03:12:19.215
just rolling shadows around your body,

4450
03:12:19.215 --> 03:12:21.252
you right below just ready to go ahead

4451
03:12:21.252 --> 03:12:25.327
and open up another can of whoop ass on it.

4452
03:12:25.327 --> 03:12:26.958
The body shifts back into that same

4453
03:12:26.958 --> 03:12:30.862
semi-translucent blue form and darts.

4454
03:12:30.862 --> 03:12:31.960
Out of the doorway.

4455
03:12:31.960 --> 03:12:33.545
TRAVIS: That's like a natural ability they have?

4456
03:12:33.545 --> 03:12:35.133
Not a spell or anything?

4457
03:12:35.133 --> 03:12:36.554
MATT: Seems to be, maybe.

4458
03:12:36.554 --> 03:12:37.817
You get an attack of opportunity, Beau does not

4459
03:12:37.817 --> 03:12:39.119
because you've already used your reaction.

4460
03:12:39.119 --> 03:12:40.951
TRAVIS: Oh nice, cool.

4461
03:12:40.951 --> 03:12:43.644
MATT: You've learned a new set of techniques, unfortunately.

4462
03:12:43.644 --> 03:12:44.718
TRAVIS: 19 to hit.

4463
03:12:44.718 --> 03:12:49.271
MATT: That would hit. As you swing with your blade,

4464
03:12:49.271 --> 03:12:51.994
passes through, no effect.

4465
03:12:51.994 --> 03:12:54.091
MARISHA: You rolled a 19?

4466
03:12:54.091 --> 03:12:55.494
MATT: As it darts out the window and then

4467
03:12:55.494 --> 03:12:59.411
vanishes out of sight beyond that window frame.

4468
03:13:00.792 --> 03:13:02.459
So Fjord, your turn.

4469
03:13:04.618 --> 03:13:06.980
TRAVIS: Yeah, okay.

4470
03:13:06.980 --> 03:13:09.957
With my bonus action, because I can see

4471
03:13:09.957 --> 03:13:11.992
out the window, I will Misty Step in the

4472
03:13:11.992 --> 03:13:15.457
direction that they seem to have disapparated.

4473
03:13:15.457 --> 03:13:16.457
MATT: All right.

4474
03:13:17.452 --> 03:13:19.123
SAM: That a word?

4475
03:13:19.123 --> 03:13:21.727
TRAVIS: In Harry Potter it is.

4476
03:13:21.727 --> 03:13:22.910
MATT: You appear there.

4477
03:13:22.910 --> 03:13:24.743
What you do notice.

4478
03:13:28.737 --> 03:13:29.737
There we go.

4479
03:13:30.572 --> 03:13:32.771
This one is in the process

4480
03:13:32.771 --> 03:13:36.153
of flying and diving down into the well.

4481
03:13:36.153 --> 03:13:37.701
LAURA: Are they ethereal still?

4482
03:13:37.701 --> 03:13:40.200
MATT: They are. Not that you would know.

4483
03:13:40.200 --> 03:13:41.033
LAURA: No, I'm just--

4484
03:13:41.033 --> 03:13:42.100
MATT: But yeah, they are.

4485
03:13:42.100 --> 03:13:43.522
Fjord, what are you doing?

4486
03:13:43.522 --> 03:13:46.537
TRAVIS: I will advance on them 30 feet.

4487
03:13:46.537 --> 03:13:47.937
MATT: All right.

4488
03:13:49.950 --> 03:13:51.424
You're there.

4489
03:13:51.424 --> 03:13:52.689
TRAVIS: That's not so bad.

4490
03:13:52.689 --> 03:13:56.313
I will take two swipes at--

4491
03:13:56.313 --> 03:13:57.942
am I in melee at both or just the one?

4492
03:13:57.942 --> 03:13:59.163
Are they still translucent?

4493
03:13:59.163 --> 03:14:00.262
MATT: Yes, they are.

4494
03:14:00.262 --> 03:14:01.851
You're in melee at both. The one that's

4495
03:14:01.851 --> 03:14:03.440
in the well technically does have half cover

4496
03:14:03.440 --> 03:14:04.662
because it is in the process

4497
03:14:04.662 --> 03:14:06.170
of leaping down inside, so the well

4498
03:14:06.170 --> 03:14:08.698
is partially obscuring its body.

4499
03:14:08.698 --> 03:14:10.958
TRAVIS: I don't know what the point is.

4500
03:14:10.958 --> 03:14:13.605
They're fucking-- they're vapor.

4501
03:14:13.605 --> 03:14:16.909
I'll take one swipe at the one that's

4502
03:14:16.909 --> 03:14:18.777
next to me that's not in the well.

4503
03:14:18.777 --> 03:14:19.777
MATT: Go for it.

4504
03:14:21.018 --> 03:14:21.851
TRAVIS: 23.

4505
03:14:21.851 --> 03:14:25.882
MATT: 23. (whooshing) No effect.

4506
03:14:25.882 --> 03:14:27.411
SAM: Oh man.

4507
03:14:27.411 --> 03:14:29.244
MATT: You get the sense with each strike

4508
03:14:29.244 --> 03:14:31.200
that you can see them, they're there,

4509
03:14:31.200 --> 03:14:32.910
but it's like they're not there.

4510
03:14:32.910 --> 03:14:34.466
It's this weird in-between.

4511
03:14:34.466 --> 03:14:35.532
TRAVIS: Cool.

4512
03:14:36.998 --> 03:14:41.998
Yep, I'll say: Fuck you! And that's it.

4513
03:14:42.244 --> 03:14:45.007
MATT: That finishes Fjord's go. Nott.

4514
03:14:45.007 --> 03:14:47.085
SAM: I'll run around the corner.

4515
03:14:47.085 --> 03:14:48.511
MATT: You glance around after watching them

4516
03:14:48.511 --> 03:14:49.734
vanish through the doorway and then

4517
03:14:49.734 --> 03:14:50.872
Fjord giving chase, you turn around

4518
03:14:50.872 --> 03:14:52.417
and you can see them all clustered

4519
03:14:52.417 --> 03:14:56.007
right around the well in the far corner of this area.

4520
03:14:56.007 --> 03:14:58.732
SAM: I will dash over there.

4521
03:14:58.732 --> 03:15:02.622
MATT: Rest of the move going to be (counting) 35,

4522
03:15:02.622 --> 03:15:04.356
and then you can bonus action dash.

4523
03:15:04.356 --> 03:15:06.305
SAM: Bonus action dash.

4524
03:15:06.305 --> 03:15:07.976
MATT: (counting) 25.

4525
03:15:07.976 --> 03:15:09.280
TRAVIS: Hey.

4526
03:15:09.280 --> 03:15:11.197
SAM: Hey.

4527
03:15:12.503 --> 03:15:15.170
I don't know what they can do.

4528
03:15:16.764 --> 03:15:19.930
I'll try to cast a spell on one of them.

4529
03:15:19.930 --> 03:15:21.358
I guess.

4530
03:15:21.358 --> 03:15:23.964
♪ I cast a spell on you ♪

4531
03:15:23.964 --> 03:15:27.342
♪ And now you're mine ♪

4532
03:15:27.342 --> 03:15:30.887
SAM: I will cast Tasha's Hideous Laughter on one of them.

4533
03:15:30.887 --> 03:15:31.720
TRAVIS: Yeah!

4534
03:15:31.720 --> 03:15:32.680
MATT: Which one?

4535
03:15:32.680 --> 03:15:35.571
SAM: The one that is not, no, the one

4536
03:15:35.571 --> 03:15:37.444
that's in the well already.

4537
03:15:37.444 --> 03:15:39.234
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4538
03:15:39.234 --> 03:15:40.580
LIAM: Cork the bottle.

4539
03:15:40.580 --> 03:15:42.334
MATT: You rush up, your hands forming

4540
03:15:42.334 --> 03:15:44.169
the incantation, these

4541
03:15:44.169 --> 03:15:47.805
faint little lines of arcane runes

4542
03:15:47.805 --> 03:15:49.305
emanate from your fingertips as you

4543
03:15:49.305 --> 03:15:50.932
draw in the air and release it

4544
03:15:50.932 --> 03:15:52.604
towards the one that's diving in the well.

4545
03:15:52.604 --> 03:15:55.198
SAM: I'm going to say: What happens when a

4546
03:15:55.198 --> 03:16:00.198
moorbounder enters a feline beauty contest?

4547
03:16:00.878 --> 03:16:03.396
It's a cat-tastrophe!

4548
03:16:04.996 --> 03:16:06.898
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

4549
03:16:06.898 --> 03:16:09.136
Do we all take psychic damage?

4550
03:16:09.136 --> 03:16:10.072
LAURA: Every time.

4551
03:16:10.072 --> 03:16:11.820
MATT: All the viewers, us at the table,

4552
03:16:11.820 --> 03:16:13.856
we all take psychic damage.

4553
03:16:13.856 --> 03:16:15.280
LIAM: Point of exhaustion.

4554
03:16:15.280 --> 03:16:16.543
MARISHA: Most powerful spell.

4555
03:16:16.543 --> 03:16:18.050
MATT: The energy of the spell is released,

4556
03:16:18.050 --> 03:16:20.824
however, the area where the spell takes effect

4557
03:16:20.824 --> 03:16:22.865
does not seem to share the same space

4558
03:16:22.865 --> 03:16:25.671
as the creature you intended, and the

4559
03:16:25.671 --> 03:16:29.449
arcane net of its effect has none.

4560
03:16:29.449 --> 03:16:30.959
SAM: Well, then I'll just use the rest of

4561
03:16:30.959 --> 03:16:32.871
my little bit of movement and just jump up

4562
03:16:32.871 --> 03:16:37.719
on the side of the well ready to pounce.

4563
03:16:37.719 --> 03:16:42.001
MATT: You're right up there. Jester, you're up.

4564
03:16:42.001 --> 03:16:43.099
LAURA: Okay.

4565
03:16:43.099 --> 03:16:45.620
I'm going to turn around, I'm going to run out

4566
03:16:45.620 --> 03:16:48.637
the door and try to chase after them.

4567
03:16:48.637 --> 03:16:49.603
MATT: Okay.

4568
03:16:49.603 --> 03:16:54.380
(counting) 30.

4569
03:16:54.380 --> 03:16:56.011
That's your 30 feet of movement.

4570
03:16:56.011 --> 03:16:59.149
LAURA: I'm going to-- I guess my

4571
03:16:59.149 --> 03:17:04.149
spiritual weapon will follow me.

4572
03:17:04.842 --> 03:17:08.123
MATT: (counting) 20, that's as far as it can go.

4573
03:17:08.123 --> 03:17:10.244
LAURA: Can it go out the window?

4574
03:17:10.244 --> 03:17:12.362
MATT: If you can see where it's going, but you have to

4575
03:17:12.362 --> 03:17:14.356
have visual perspective on where to send it.

4576
03:17:14.356 --> 03:17:15.412
If you wanted to--

4577
03:17:15.412 --> 03:17:17.328
LAURA: I could leave it in the room until I see around

4578
03:17:17.328 --> 03:17:19.076
the corner, and then I'll bring it out with me?

4579
03:17:19.076 --> 03:17:19.975
MATT: You can do that.

4580
03:17:19.975 --> 03:17:21.481
LAURA: Okay, I'll do that.

4581
03:17:21.481 --> 03:17:23.981
MATT: Instead you have it here.

4582
03:17:24.819 --> 03:17:26.002
That's your action to get there.

4583
03:17:26.002 --> 03:17:26.835
LAURA: Yeah.

4584
03:17:27.795 --> 03:17:28.628
Then--

4585
03:17:28.628 --> 03:17:29.543
MATT: That's your movement to get there. You have

4586
03:17:29.543 --> 03:17:31.173
your action and your bonus action still.

4587
03:17:31.173 --> 03:17:32.532
LAURA: Oh right.

4588
03:17:34.625 --> 03:17:37.913
I'll use my action to double--

4589
03:17:37.913 --> 03:17:38.746
MATT: Dash?

4590
03:17:38.746 --> 03:17:39.579
LAURA: Yeah.

4591
03:17:39.579 --> 03:17:40.808
MATT: Okay.

4592
03:17:40.808 --> 03:17:43.374
(counting) 30, we'll say

4593
03:17:43.374 --> 03:17:44.798
you get around the corner there

4594
03:17:44.798 --> 03:17:46.263
and you can use your bonus action to--

4595
03:17:46.263 --> 03:17:48.005
LAURA: Yeah, to bring the spiritual weapon out.

4596
03:17:48.005 --> 03:17:50.425
MATT: Five, ten, 15, 20.

4597
03:17:50.425 --> 03:17:52.277
There you go. That's your turn.

4598
03:17:52.277 --> 03:17:54.033
That brings us to Beauregard.

4599
03:17:54.033 --> 03:17:56.893
MARISHA: Can I jump through the window?

4600
03:17:56.893 --> 03:17:59.583
MATT: You can certainly try.

4601
03:17:59.583 --> 03:18:00.720
MARISHA: Double speed.

4602
03:18:00.720 --> 03:18:02.123
TRAVIS: Trinity.

4603
03:18:02.123 --> 03:18:03.794
MATT: Ten-- I'm not going to make you roll for it.

4604
03:18:03.794 --> 03:18:05.302
It's a hasted action, and you're

4605
03:18:05.302 --> 03:18:07.785
a slender figure anyway, you just dive through,

4606
03:18:07.785 --> 03:18:10.436
come to a roll and back to your feet.

4607
03:18:10.436 --> 03:18:12.364
TALIESIN: Old school Superman serial stunt move.

4608
03:18:12.364 --> 03:18:14.864
SAM: She ain't no slow-regard!

4609
03:18:16.812 --> 03:18:18.645
Look at her go-regard!

4610
03:18:19.746 --> 03:18:20.829
MATT: No Sam, no.

4611
03:18:22.068 --> 03:18:23.092
SAM: No-regard!

4612
03:18:23.092 --> 03:18:25.340
TRAVIS: Please no more!

4613
03:18:25.340 --> 03:18:26.824
MATT: Double speed, that's your movement.

4614
03:18:26.824 --> 03:18:30.570
You still have your action and bonus action.

4615
03:18:30.570 --> 03:18:33.136
MARISHA: What am I going to do with these people?

4616
03:18:33.136 --> 03:18:34.719
I can't punch them.

4617
03:18:35.940 --> 03:18:37.773
LAURA: Try talking to them.

4618
03:18:38.956 --> 03:18:40.340
MATT: You hear Jester shout behind you.

4619
03:18:40.340 --> 03:18:42.173
LAURA: Try talking to them!

4620
03:18:43.926 --> 03:18:44.759
MARISHA: Uh...

4621
03:18:46.167 --> 03:18:49.181
I say, in Deep Speech.

4622
03:18:49.181 --> 03:18:50.014
MATT: Okay.

4623
03:18:53.011 --> 03:18:56.261
MARISHA: What I can remember from Latin class.

4624
03:19:00.177 --> 03:19:02.669
I say, what do I say?

4625
03:19:09.227 --> 03:19:13.094
I say: I don't think you want to run from us.

4626
03:19:13.094 --> 03:19:13.927
MATT: Okay.

4627
03:19:15.537 --> 03:19:18.204
MARISHA: Don't think you want to do that.

4628
03:19:19.774 --> 03:19:21.241
MATT: Make a persuasion check,

4629
03:19:21.241 --> 03:19:22.950
or would this be intimidation?

4630
03:19:22.950 --> 03:19:25.117
I think it's intimidation.

4631
03:19:26.700 --> 03:19:28.126
MARISHA: 17?

4632
03:19:28.126 --> 03:19:29.064
MATT: Okay.

4633
03:19:29.064 --> 03:19:31.915
As you say that, the one that's diving down

4634
03:19:31.915 --> 03:19:34.159
is now just heading out of view.

4635
03:19:34.159 --> 03:19:35.789
The secondary one that's off the side

4636
03:19:35.789 --> 03:19:37.499
looks towards you with a grin,

4637
03:19:37.499 --> 03:19:39.171
and doesn't move its lips, but a voice

4638
03:19:39.171 --> 03:19:41.741
in your head says, "I'm sorry,

4639
03:19:41.741 --> 03:19:44.408
"I don't know what you're saying.

4640
03:19:45.687 --> 03:19:48.437
"But please, come play and follow."

4641
03:19:51.876 --> 03:19:52.792
Beauregard?

4642
03:19:52.792 --> 03:19:53.625
MARISHA: Yeah?

4643
03:19:53.625 --> 03:19:56.281
MATT: I'll say that whole exchange,

4644
03:19:56.281 --> 03:19:57.638
that'll be out of your action.

4645
03:19:57.638 --> 03:19:59.184
You have a bonus action still if you want to.

4646
03:19:59.184 --> 03:20:00.525
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4647
03:20:00.525 --> 03:20:01.908
MATT: You going to end your turn?

4648
03:20:01.908 --> 03:20:03.783
All right, Caduceus.

4649
03:20:03.783 --> 03:20:06.469
TALIESIN: Full runaround with both action

4650
03:20:06.469 --> 03:20:09.302
and movement, as far as I can get.

4651
03:20:12.007 --> 03:20:13.832
MATT: 30, you're coming around the corner

4652
03:20:13.832 --> 03:20:15.994
right next to Beau's--

4653
03:20:15.994 --> 03:20:19.170
TALIESIN: Also for my bonus, I will tell my swarm

4654
03:20:19.170 --> 03:20:23.953
to head out the window and find those people.

4655
03:20:26.259 --> 03:20:27.199
MATT: 30.

4656
03:20:27.199 --> 03:20:28.583
TALIESIN: They're 20, I believe, actually.

4657
03:20:28.583 --> 03:20:29.416
MATT: Oh, 20?

4658
03:20:29.416 --> 03:20:32.458
They're in the window right there!

4659
03:20:32.458 --> 03:20:35.242
Yeah, as they move you hear, (panicked noises)

4660
03:20:35.242 --> 03:20:39.436
as the now somewhat lucid bugbear denizen

4661
03:20:39.436 --> 03:20:41.919
of this chamber is wondering what the fuck

4662
03:20:41.919 --> 03:20:43.592
is happening and is now just watching

4663
03:20:43.592 --> 03:20:45.911
a cloud of beetles just scatter across

4664
03:20:45.911 --> 03:20:48.559
his visual range and completely engulf

4665
03:20:48.559 --> 03:20:52.923
the ceiling and window area of his bedroom.

4666
03:20:52.923 --> 03:20:56.382
LAURA: My duplicate is just smiling at him really creepily.

4667
03:20:56.382 --> 03:20:58.542
MATT: He's like (panicked noises)

4668
03:20:58.542 --> 03:21:01.625
SAM: Don't let the bed bugbears bite.

4669
03:21:02.852 --> 03:21:05.135
LAURA: Every, just one after the other, Sam.

4670
03:21:05.135 --> 03:21:08.635
TRAVIS: You got to leave and come back in.

4671
03:21:09.740 --> 03:21:12.142
LAURA: We need a short rest.

4672
03:21:12.142 --> 03:21:13.706
MATT: Apparently.

4673
03:21:13.706 --> 03:21:15.052
All right, that finish Caduceus's go,

4674
03:21:15.052 --> 03:21:16.234
Caleb, you're up.

4675
03:21:16.234 --> 03:21:18.356
LIAM: I grab the leather strip tied around

4676
03:21:18.356 --> 03:21:19.943
my thigh and mutter a few arcane words

4677
03:21:19.943 --> 03:21:22.552
and bring up Mage Armor and enter the room.

4678
03:21:22.552 --> 03:21:24.956
And look out that window, because I

4679
03:21:24.956 --> 03:21:27.154
don't know what's going on yet fully.

4680
03:21:27.154 --> 03:21:28.661
Stick my head out and see what's going on

4681
03:21:28.661 --> 03:21:30.612
and say: What is the plan? What are we doing?

4682
03:21:30.612 --> 03:21:32.034
And that's the end of my turn.

4683
03:21:32.034 --> 03:21:34.152
MATT: Okay, you look out there and there's nobody there.

4684
03:21:34.152 --> 03:21:35.905
You hear them for a second, you hear crickets.

4685
03:21:35.905 --> 03:21:36.881
Or are you looking out this windows?

4686
03:21:36.881 --> 03:21:38.347
LIAM: I'm at the bug window.

4687
03:21:38.347 --> 03:21:39.812
I enter this room.

4688
03:21:39.812 --> 03:21:41.727
MATT: You go out there and it is

4689
03:21:41.727 --> 03:21:45.312
just a cloud of insects and you're

4690
03:21:45.312 --> 03:21:47.718
slowly pushing your head through

4691
03:21:47.718 --> 03:21:50.816
and you feel the (landings) across your face.

4692
03:21:50.816 --> 03:21:52.403
You open your mouth to talk and one of them,

4693
03:21:52.403 --> 03:21:54.398
you're like why does, (spitting)!

4694
03:21:54.398 --> 03:21:57.565
You spit one out and it finds its way.

4695
03:21:58.462 --> 03:21:59.985
LIAM: And that's the end of my turn.

4696
03:21:59.985 --> 03:22:02.068
MATT: That ends Caleb's go.

4697
03:22:04.246 --> 03:22:08.838
The male fiendish creature finishes the descent

4698
03:22:08.838 --> 03:22:13.096
down into the well and vanishes from view.

4699
03:22:14.090 --> 03:22:16.613
SAM: Do we get an attack of opportunity?

4700
03:22:16.613 --> 03:22:18.651
Doesn't matter.

4701
03:22:18.651 --> 03:22:22.154
MATT: From there that brings us to Yasha's turn.

4702
03:22:22.154 --> 03:22:23.904
TRAVIS: Yeah, Yasha will...

4703
03:22:26.270 --> 03:22:29.407
Jesus, she can't push past the beetles

4704
03:22:29.407 --> 03:22:31.887
and Caleb and get out the window, can she?

4705
03:22:31.887 --> 03:22:33.066
MATT: She can if she wants to.

4706
03:22:33.066 --> 03:22:34.414
LIAM: Shove the wizard through.

4707
03:22:34.414 --> 03:22:35.882
TRAVIS: Yeah fuck it, she's going

4708
03:22:35.882 --> 03:22:37.637
American Gladiators through the window.

4709
03:22:37.637 --> 03:22:41.101
MATT: After you're like what's the plan?

4710
03:22:41.101 --> 03:22:43.508
Oof, all of a sudden you just get pushed down

4711
03:22:43.508 --> 03:22:46.470
and Yasha just muscles through the window.

4712
03:22:46.470 --> 03:22:48.584
Some of the beetles get crushed against

4713
03:22:48.584 --> 03:22:50.784
the sides of the portal, and Yasha's bigger

4714
03:22:50.784 --> 03:22:52.657
than Beau, so whereas Beau can dive through

4715
03:22:52.657 --> 03:22:55.260
Yasha has to squeeze through

4716
03:22:55.260 --> 03:22:58.233
and lands on the opposite side.

4717
03:22:58.233 --> 03:22:59.333
That's her movement.

4718
03:22:59.333 --> 03:23:01.855
She still has, she actually has

4719
03:23:01.855 --> 03:23:03.645
tem more feet of movement, she's a barbarian.

4720
03:23:03.645 --> 03:23:05.518
TRAVIS: Yeah, she'll dash and catch up to the rest.

4721
03:23:05.518 --> 03:23:07.919
MATT: All right, and so you guys have all found the outside.

4722
03:23:07.919 --> 03:23:10.361
End of Yasha's turn, the other fiendish creature

4723
03:23:10.361 --> 03:23:13.042
dives into the well and actually goes,

4724
03:23:13.042 --> 03:23:14.832
gives a wink and blows a kiss

4725
03:23:14.832 --> 03:23:19.140
and disappears into the shaded well below.

4726
03:23:20.292 --> 03:23:22.532
They are no longer visible.

4727
03:23:22.532 --> 03:23:23.949
Fjord, your turn.

4728
03:23:26.202 --> 03:23:27.035
TRAVIS: Well.

4729
03:23:28.646 --> 03:23:30.563
This feels like a trap.

4730
03:23:37.042 --> 03:23:39.527
I'm going to wait for our group to catch up.

4731
03:23:39.527 --> 03:23:40.360
MATT: Okay.

4732
03:23:41.360 --> 03:23:44.211
12 seconds later everyone managed to gather.

4733
03:23:44.211 --> 03:23:47.140
MARISHA: I'll circle around staring down the hole.

4734
03:23:47.140 --> 03:23:49.541
MATT: As you all gather around the outside,

4735
03:23:49.541 --> 03:23:51.376
the beetles overhead, you hear this voice

4736
03:23:51.376 --> 03:23:53.626
behind go, "What is going on?"

4737
03:23:56.260 --> 03:23:57.808
You look through the window and

4738
03:23:57.808 --> 03:24:01.188
you see this half-dazed, very confused,

4739
03:24:01.188 --> 03:24:03.310
scared-looking bugbear, a familiar one

4740
03:24:03.310 --> 03:24:05.838
to you, peeking through going (confused noises).

4741
03:24:05.838 --> 03:24:08.117
TRAVIS: Get your head back in that window!

4742
03:24:08.117 --> 03:24:09.829
MATT: "Of course, sorry!"

4743
03:24:09.829 --> 03:24:12.996
And slowly backs into the bed chamber.

4744
03:24:14.720 --> 03:24:15.572
TRAVIS: Well.

4745
03:24:15.572 --> 03:24:16.405
SAM: Come on!

4746
03:24:16.405 --> 03:24:19.159
LAURA: I'll bring my duplicate over while we're...

4747
03:24:19.159 --> 03:24:20.014
SAM: Let's go!

4748
03:24:20.014 --> 03:24:21.438
TRAVIS: I mean, where are we going?

4749
03:24:21.438 --> 03:24:24.244
Down in there into the rift in the portal?

4750
03:24:24.244 --> 03:24:25.206
SAM: Yes!

4751
03:24:25.206 --> 03:24:26.874
TRAVIS: Or are we just going to seal it up?

4752
03:24:26.874 --> 03:24:28.464
SAM: I don't know.

4753
03:24:28.464 --> 03:24:30.052
MARISHA: She said she wanted proof, how are we

4754
03:24:30.052 --> 03:24:33.346
going to show proof that we sealed a portal?

4755
03:24:33.346 --> 03:24:34.851
SAM: Take a picture?

4756
03:24:34.851 --> 03:24:37.497
TRAVIS: You got a cell phone?

4757
03:24:37.497 --> 03:24:40.794
SAM: You can draw. I don't know.

4758
03:24:40.794 --> 03:24:45.515
We can't just sit here. This is what we came for.

4759
03:24:48.397 --> 03:24:50.104
TRAVIS: Yeah, all right.

4760
03:24:50.104 --> 03:24:52.437
SAM: Are you a coward suddenly?

4761
03:24:54.138 --> 03:24:55.487
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll climb down into the well.

4762
03:24:55.487 --> 03:24:57.257
SAM: I'm going down.

4763
03:24:57.257 --> 03:25:00.333
MARISHA: Just trying to be patient, fuck.

4764
03:25:00.333 --> 03:25:02.168
MATT: Okay, you're climbing down together?

4765
03:25:02.168 --> 03:25:03.637
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4766
03:25:03.637 --> 03:25:05.920
SAM: Want to jump? I can make us jump.

4767
03:25:05.920 --> 03:25:07.260
TRAVIS: Sure.

4768
03:25:07.260 --> 03:25:08.093
LAURA: 30 feet.

4769
03:25:08.093 --> 03:25:08.926
SAM: Jump with me!

4770
03:25:08.926 --> 03:25:09.759
TRAVIS: Okay.

4771
03:25:09.759 --> 03:25:11.049
SAM: Feather Fall.

4772
03:25:11.049 --> 03:25:14.922
MATT: Okay, you both leap, one after the other,

4773
03:25:14.922 --> 03:25:18.266
and then drift down gently into

4774
03:25:18.266 --> 03:25:20.139
the surface of the water below.

4775
03:25:20.139 --> 03:25:21.565
You begin to approach and approach

4776
03:25:21.565 --> 03:25:22.994
and at the last second you push off

4777
03:25:22.994 --> 03:25:24.784
the back of the well and make your way

4778
03:25:24.784 --> 03:25:27.224
towards that opening, it's not very big.

4779
03:25:27.224 --> 03:25:30.278
You go ahead Nott and squeeze through.

4780
03:25:30.278 --> 03:25:33.817
Fjord, you wedge yourself halfway in.

4781
03:25:33.817 --> 03:25:36.427
Your head and one arm and part of a knee in there

4782
03:25:36.427 --> 03:25:38.382
and the other half of your body's like.

4783
03:25:38.382 --> 03:25:39.400
SAM: Should I pull you through?

4784
03:25:39.400 --> 03:25:40.991
TRAVIS: It's a tight fit.

4785
03:25:40.991 --> 03:25:42.241
I'll wiggle it.

4786
03:25:44.696 --> 03:25:46.946
MATT: Make an acrobatics check.

4787
03:25:48.570 --> 03:25:49.403
TRAVIS: Nope.

4788
03:25:49.403 --> 03:25:51.665
MATT: You are wedged, you are Winnie the Pooh

4789
03:25:51.665 --> 03:25:54.311
trying to exit Rabbit's house right now.

4790
03:25:54.311 --> 03:25:55.329
LAURA: Do you need some help?

4791
03:25:55.329 --> 03:25:56.509
TRAVIS: Well, the hole's plugged.

4792
03:25:56.509 --> 03:25:57.759
We can go home.

4793
03:25:58.665 --> 03:26:00.827
LAURA: I'm going to climb down the well and try to push him.

4794
03:26:00.827 --> 03:26:02.306
SAM: I have pull.

4795
03:26:02.306 --> 03:26:03.139
TRAVIS: Ow!

4796
03:26:04.248 --> 03:26:05.752
MATT: Make a strength check with advantage

4797
03:26:05.752 --> 03:26:08.085
because Nott is helping you.

4798
03:26:10.066 --> 03:26:11.733
LAURA: That one's cocked.

4799
03:26:13.968 --> 03:26:16.354
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

4800
03:26:16.354 --> 03:26:17.657
Ten.

4801
03:26:17.657 --> 03:26:18.490
MATT: Ten?

4802
03:26:20.257 --> 03:26:22.604
You push and push and push, you do manage

4803
03:26:22.604 --> 03:26:26.270
to eventually force Fjord through.

4804
03:26:26.270 --> 03:26:29.034
Your torso is caught up on a jagged

4805
03:26:29.034 --> 03:26:32.709
piece of exposed earth and you do

4806
03:26:32.709 --> 03:26:34.766
take two points of piercing damage

4807
03:26:34.766 --> 03:26:36.639
as you are forced through the opening

4808
03:26:36.639 --> 03:26:39.404
and then find yourself on the opposite side.

4809
03:26:39.404 --> 03:26:42.412
As you land all hands and knees onto the ground,

4810
03:26:42.412 --> 03:26:44.245
a bit of the caked up dust also has

4811
03:26:44.245 --> 03:26:48.280
remnants of that strong sulfurous smell.

4812
03:26:48.280 --> 03:26:50.798
To accompany the long forgotten dust

4813
03:26:50.798 --> 03:26:53.631
and a bit of that musty wet earth.

4814
03:26:54.623 --> 03:26:56.252
The rest of you guys?

4815
03:26:56.252 --> 03:26:57.624
TALIESIN: I'm going to wait for Yasha to see

4816
03:26:57.624 --> 03:26:59.545
if she can open up the hole a little bit.

4817
03:26:59.545 --> 03:27:01.130
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm going to wait and just

4818
03:27:01.130 --> 03:27:04.145
look down and I'm going to see what happens.

4819
03:27:04.145 --> 03:27:06.305
LIAM: We've taken a few moments here right?

4820
03:27:06.305 --> 03:27:07.138
MATT: Yes.

4821
03:27:07.138 --> 03:27:08.708
LIAM: A wave of exhaustion hits you just

4822
03:27:08.708 --> 03:27:11.881
for five seconds, and then passes.

4823
03:27:11.881 --> 03:27:13.422
MATT: Your Beacon of Hope lasts for?

4824
03:27:13.422 --> 03:27:14.788
TALIESIN: One minute, it's probably gone now.

4825
03:27:14.788 --> 03:27:16.032
MATT: So that fades.

4826
03:27:16.032 --> 03:27:17.633
LAURA: Yeah, all my stuff is gone, too.

4827
03:27:17.633 --> 03:27:19.391
TALIESIN: The beetles probably have returned to their--

4828
03:27:19.391 --> 03:27:20.917
MATT: They have.

4829
03:27:20.917 --> 03:27:22.875
TALIESIN: All right.

4830
03:27:22.875 --> 03:27:24.075
LAURA: Can I start kicking at the hole

4831
03:27:24.075 --> 03:27:26.423
to try and open it up?

4832
03:27:26.423 --> 03:27:27.891
MATT: Sure.

4833
03:27:27.891 --> 03:27:29.719
You go down before Yasha, or you're

4834
03:27:29.719 --> 03:27:31.691
already right there pushing Fjord in.

4835
03:27:31.691 --> 03:27:33.564
LAURA: I was bracing my back and pushing through

4836
03:27:33.564 --> 03:27:35.356
with my legs on him, so I'm just going to keep

4837
03:27:35.356 --> 03:27:37.267
kicking with my feet to try to open the floor.

4838
03:27:37.267 --> 03:27:40.610
MATT: Make an additional strength check for me, please.

4839
03:27:40.610 --> 03:27:41.693
LAURA: Whoa, geez.

4840
03:27:42.656 --> 03:27:43.919
That was aggressive.

4841
03:27:43.919 --> 03:27:45.101
LIAM: Is there a bucket on this one,

4842
03:27:45.101 --> 03:27:46.854
or is it just an open hole?

4843
03:27:46.854 --> 03:27:47.953
MATT: This one has a bucket, yes.

4844
03:27:47.953 --> 03:27:48.824
LIAM: And a rope?

4845
03:27:48.824 --> 03:27:50.209
MATT: Well, it's a chain.

4846
03:27:50.209 --> 03:27:51.271
LAURA: 14.

4847
03:27:51.271 --> 03:27:53.471
MATT: Because one's using, lower themselves down.

4848
03:27:53.471 --> 03:27:54.650
14?

4849
03:27:54.650 --> 03:27:56.686
You push off and kick once.

4850
03:27:56.686 --> 03:27:58.154
A second time.

4851
03:27:58.154 --> 03:28:00.513
The third time, as you put all of your weight

4852
03:28:00.513 --> 03:28:03.976
and your armored feet into it, the stone then

4853
03:28:03.976 --> 03:28:06.342
crumbles and you end up widening it

4854
03:28:06.342 --> 03:28:08.828
by another foot and a half or so.

4855
03:28:08.828 --> 03:28:11.066
From that impact you get caught up

4856
03:28:11.066 --> 03:28:12.694
and you kick off and then come back

4857
03:28:12.694 --> 03:28:14.241
and you find yourself in the well again,

4858
03:28:14.241 --> 03:28:15.626
but it's in a big enough space

4859
03:28:15.626 --> 03:28:17.094
where it's not an issue, and you're

4860
03:28:17.094 --> 03:28:18.602
a little small than-- although actually no,

4861
03:28:18.602 --> 03:28:19.701
your frames are fairly similar

4862
03:28:19.701 --> 03:28:22.629
though you're shorter, but without issue

4863
03:28:22.629 --> 03:28:25.235
you manage to push your way through.

4864
03:28:25.235 --> 03:28:27.640
MARISHA: I'm going to look around, anybody watching us?

4865
03:28:27.640 --> 03:28:29.807
MATT: Make a perception check.

4866
03:28:31.179 --> 03:28:33.975
SAM: What's it look down there, too?

4867
03:28:33.975 --> 03:28:35.155
What do we see?

4868
03:28:35.155 --> 03:28:36.252
MATT: I'll get to that in just a minute.

4869
03:28:36.252 --> 03:28:37.403
MARISHA: 12.

4870
03:28:37.403 --> 03:28:39.313
MATT: Looking around you this time of night,

4871
03:28:39.313 --> 03:28:41.065
it's hard to tell, you don't see anyone

4872
03:28:41.065 --> 03:28:42.731
paying major attention other than

4873
03:28:42.731 --> 03:28:45.705
Umadon, the bugbear that is currently peeking

4874
03:28:45.705 --> 03:28:47.786
through the window and looks extremely

4875
03:28:47.786 --> 03:28:49.131
frightened by what's going on.

4876
03:28:49.131 --> 03:28:51.943
TRAVIS: Put your face back in the window!

4877
03:28:51.943 --> 03:28:55.240
MARISHA: Go to bed! Back to bed!

4878
03:28:55.240 --> 03:28:56.753
MATT: Pokes back into the interior.

4879
03:28:56.753 --> 03:28:58.745
MARISHA: Back to bed, booboo.

4880
03:28:58.745 --> 03:29:01.268
TRAVIS: I can see you looking.

4881
03:29:01.268 --> 03:29:02.314
MATT: And then you.

4882
03:29:02.314 --> 03:29:05.047
SAM: I'm looking around, what do we see in front of us?

4883
03:29:05.047 --> 03:29:07.104
MATT: You can make a perception check as well.

4884
03:29:07.104 --> 03:29:08.733
SAM: I'm the worst at this.

4885
03:29:08.733 --> 03:29:10.239
16.

4886
03:29:10.239 --> 03:29:11.156
MATT: 16, okay.

4887
03:29:13.460 --> 03:29:16.428
Behind this gap you see a narrow tunnel that seems

4888
03:29:16.428 --> 03:29:19.620
to snake forward and in a downward motion.

4889
03:29:19.620 --> 03:29:24.595
Roughly ten to 15 feet wide at maximum,

4890
03:29:24.595 --> 03:29:27.795
and it curves out of sight about 25 feet

4891
03:29:27.795 --> 03:29:29.628
ahead of you. It turns and then

4892
03:29:29.628 --> 03:29:32.605
curves downward and out of the way.

4893
03:29:32.605 --> 03:29:35.867
You can see this chamber is natural.

4894
03:29:35.867 --> 03:29:37.903
It seems that this well was buttressed

4895
03:29:37.903 --> 03:29:40.958
against it in its construction, and the

4896
03:29:40.958 --> 03:29:43.849
texture of the ground is very moist.

4897
03:29:43.849 --> 03:29:46.569
Whatever source of this groundwater is nearby

4898
03:29:46.569 --> 03:29:48.973
seems to, either at one point may have created

4899
03:29:48.973 --> 03:29:51.134
part of this cavern and carved it through,

4900
03:29:51.134 --> 03:29:53.170
or was sealed as part of

4901
03:29:53.170 --> 03:29:56.346
the construction of this well.

4902
03:29:56.346 --> 03:29:58.913
You do see pieces of rock and natural mineral

4903
03:29:58.913 --> 03:30:02.913
that long ago did form into hanging stalactites.

4904
03:30:04.134 --> 03:30:06.898
You can see elements of white and gray

4905
03:30:06.898 --> 03:30:08.365
and yellowish minerals that have

4906
03:30:08.365 --> 03:30:10.885
gathered in rings across the base

4907
03:30:10.885 --> 03:30:13.617
to the tip of these at different stages.

4908
03:30:13.617 --> 03:30:15.850
Looking at it, because you have

4909
03:30:15.850 --> 03:30:17.562
darkvision, it doesn't help too much,

4910
03:30:17.562 --> 03:30:18.947
but a little bit of light seems to

4911
03:30:18.947 --> 03:30:20.781
poke in from upstairs, you get a point

4912
03:30:20.781 --> 03:30:22.288
of reference to see that there's

4913
03:30:22.288 --> 03:30:24.564
moisture on the stones, there's a bit

4914
03:30:24.564 --> 03:30:27.314
of glistening reflection to them.

4915
03:30:28.468 --> 03:30:31.772
SAM: I convey some of that to the rest of the people.

4916
03:30:31.772 --> 03:30:33.689
TALIESIN: Heading down as well.

4917
03:30:34.558 --> 03:30:36.148
MATT: I mean there's Jester up in the way.

4918
03:30:36.148 --> 03:30:37.324
It's the hardest for you to get in

4919
03:30:37.324 --> 03:30:38.871
just from a sheer volume standpoint,

4920
03:30:38.871 --> 03:30:40.339
but with your friends you do

4921
03:30:40.339 --> 03:30:42.129
a one two three pull, and they

4922
03:30:42.129 --> 03:30:44.734
hoist Caduceus into the interior.

4923
03:30:44.734 --> 03:30:46.322
TALIESIN: I figure they know we're coming,

4924
03:30:46.322 --> 03:30:48.884
so Light's not a terrible idea.

4925
03:30:48.884 --> 03:30:49.884
TRAVIS: Go for it.

4926
03:30:51.284 --> 03:30:53.684
MATT: A little light fills the interior of the chamber

4927
03:30:53.684 --> 03:30:58.368
and you all can see this probably long forgotten,

4928
03:30:58.368 --> 03:31:03.318
condensed, but strangely beautiful cavernous chamber,

4929
03:31:04.270 --> 03:31:07.649
and the tunnel ahead that curves.

4930
03:31:07.649 --> 03:31:10.380
SAM: I'll turn invisible and run down the hall.

4931
03:31:10.380 --> 03:31:11.480
MATT: Okay.

4932
03:31:11.480 --> 03:31:15.183
You cast Invisibility on yourself, perfect.

4933
03:31:15.183 --> 03:31:16.850
SAM: Stealthily run.

4934
03:31:18.157 --> 03:31:21.053
MATT: You guys watch Nott just vanish from sight.

4935
03:31:21.053 --> 03:31:22.723
TRAVIS: The shadow fades a while ago.

4936
03:31:22.723 --> 03:31:23.556
MATT: Okay.

4937
03:31:23.556 --> 03:31:24.924
TALIESIN: Should probably head in that direction

4938
03:31:24.924 --> 03:31:28.387
unless anybody's got anything they want to say.

4939
03:31:28.387 --> 03:31:31.441
MARISHA: When I could feel their essence, I don't know,

4940
03:31:31.441 --> 03:31:34.293
it was like their blood was made of all of

4941
03:31:34.293 --> 03:31:37.635
the chemicals, or the elements, ever.

4942
03:31:37.635 --> 03:31:40.072
I think that's where they get their resistances from.

4943
03:31:40.072 --> 03:31:42.719
LAURA: They're just resistant to everything?

4944
03:31:42.719 --> 03:31:47.702
MARISHA: Elemental and magic and poison,

4945
03:31:47.702 --> 03:31:51.958
they felt cold but hot at the same time.

4946
03:31:51.958 --> 03:31:53.710
I don't know.

4947
03:31:53.710 --> 03:31:55.342
I'm still trying to work this out.

4948
03:31:55.342 --> 03:31:57.700
LAURA: No, yeah, I mean you just learned stuff.

4949
03:31:57.700 --> 03:31:59.656
LIAM: And Nott just ran up that tunnel.

4950
03:31:59.656 --> 03:32:01.983
LAURA: Yeah, let's go after her.

4951
03:32:01.983 --> 03:32:02.919
MATT: All right.

4952
03:32:02.919 --> 03:32:05.487
You guys take this information in,

4953
03:32:05.487 --> 03:32:07.568
communally form a deep breath,

4954
03:32:07.568 --> 03:32:09.929
and begin to make your chase after

4955
03:32:09.929 --> 03:32:13.103
the invisible Nott as the tunnel curves

4956
03:32:13.103 --> 03:32:16.478
to a downward left motion into

4957
03:32:16.478 --> 03:32:18.151
the further darkness to wherever

4958
03:32:18.151 --> 03:32:20.919
this leads below the city of Asarius.

4959
03:32:20.919 --> 03:32:23.054
That's where we're going to pick up next week.

4960
03:32:23.054 --> 03:32:25.359
SAM and LIAM: Bastards.

4961
03:32:25.359 --> 03:32:27.720
TRAVIS: Damn it, nothing hits them when they're like that?

4962
03:32:27.720 --> 03:32:28.777
What the fuck?

4963
03:32:28.777 --> 03:32:29.953
SAM: How can we kill them?

4964
03:32:29.953 --> 03:32:31.707
TALIESIN: Got to try some ghost stuff.

4965
03:32:31.707 --> 03:32:34.334
SAM: Or the power of music.

4966
03:32:37.530 --> 03:32:41.291
MATT: ♪ It's the power of love ♪

4967
03:32:41.291 --> 03:32:44.256
TALIESIN: We could Rick Roll them. Just saying.

4968
03:32:44.256 --> 03:32:46.209
TRAVIS: ♪ Never going to give you up ♪

4969
03:32:46.209 --> 03:32:50.121
♪ Never going to let you down ♪

4970
03:32:50.121 --> 03:32:51.629
SAM: Oh boy, guys.

4971
03:32:51.629 --> 03:32:52.890
MARISHA: Oh man.

4972
03:32:52.890 --> 03:32:54.057
SAM: What a week.

4973
03:32:55.052 --> 03:32:56.643
What an amazing week.

4974
03:32:56.643 --> 03:32:58.804
MATT: This week is crazy.

4975
03:32:58.804 --> 03:33:00.027
SAM: Yeah.

4976
03:33:00.027 --> 03:33:01.194
This is crazy.

4977
03:33:02.143 --> 03:33:03.650
TALIESIN: So much.

4978
03:33:03.650 --> 03:33:04.914
MATT: Thank you guys, thank you all

4979
03:33:04.914 --> 03:33:07.760
for your amazing support for this.

4980
03:33:07.760 --> 03:33:08.983
We're super excited to put this

4981
03:33:08.983 --> 03:33:11.550
together and bring it to you.

4982
03:33:11.550 --> 03:33:13.099
Thank you for just being part of this

4983
03:33:13.099 --> 03:33:14.317
incredible community, for coming

4984
03:33:14.317 --> 03:33:15.497
and being a part of this game,

4985
03:33:15.497 --> 03:33:17.858
for making your own games.

4986
03:33:17.858 --> 03:33:20.257
Once again please take this positive energy

4987
03:33:20.257 --> 03:33:21.884
that you've used to support us,

4988
03:33:21.884 --> 03:33:23.142
and going forward, do your best to

4989
03:33:23.142 --> 03:33:24.324
pay it forward to all the wonderful

4990
03:33:24.324 --> 03:33:25.951
people in this community that don't

4991
03:33:25.951 --> 03:33:27.780
have the platform that we do.

4992
03:33:27.780 --> 03:33:29.086
We'll continue to do the same on our end

4993
03:33:29.086 --> 03:33:31.163
best we can, but keep an eye out for all

4994
03:33:31.163 --> 03:33:33.040
these fantastic people with great ideas,

4995
03:33:33.040 --> 03:33:35.080
great designs, great art, and great things to bring

4996
03:33:35.080 --> 03:33:39.524
to this space, and help lift them up as well.

4997
03:33:39.524 --> 03:33:41.768
We love you guys very much.

4998
03:33:41.768 --> 03:33:43.313
We'll be at Emerald City Comic-Con next week,

4999
03:33:43.313 --> 03:33:45.875
I forgot to mention this earlier.

5000
03:33:45.875 --> 03:33:48.321
The 16th and the 17th. It is next week we'll be there.

5001
03:33:48.321 --> 03:33:50.602
Our panels will be livestreamed, so keep an eye

5002
03:33:50.602 --> 03:33:52.396
on CritRole.com for all the information

5003
03:33:52.396 --> 03:33:54.313
as well as the Twitter account for more info

5004
03:33:54.313 --> 03:33:57.612
on when and how you can see those.

5005
03:33:57.612 --> 03:34:01.161
A reminder, daylight savings time starts this Sunday.

5006
03:34:01.161 --> 03:34:02.343
For those of us that deal with that because

5007
03:34:02.343 --> 03:34:04.579
some countries are still behind the times.

5008
03:34:04.579 --> 03:34:05.585
Meaning us.

5009
03:34:05.585 --> 03:34:07.099
TALIESIN: If you don't know what that is,

5010
03:34:07.099 --> 03:34:08.067
you should Google it and laugh.

5011
03:34:08.067 --> 03:34:10.412
MATT: And laugh that we still do this in places.

5012
03:34:10.412 --> 03:34:11.727
MARISHA: Con weekend.

5013
03:34:11.727 --> 03:34:13.435
TALIESIN: Aww.

5014
03:34:13.435 --> 03:34:14.268
MARISHA: Oh no.

5015
03:34:14.268 --> 03:34:15.958
SAM: It's going to be fine.

5016
03:34:15.958 --> 03:34:17.063
TALIESIN: It's always fine, isn't it?

5017
03:34:17.063 --> 03:34:19.595
LIAM: We're already exhausted, what's the difference?

5018
03:34:19.595 --> 03:34:20.612
MARISHA: It's true.

5019
03:34:20.612 --> 03:34:23.173
MATT: This week has been a perpetual out-of-body experience.

5020
03:34:23.173 --> 03:34:26.718
We're still figuring out how to be corporeal.

5021
03:34:26.718 --> 03:34:28.063
Kind of like the creatures that you

5022
03:34:28.063 --> 03:34:29.569
just encountered, look at that timing.

5023
03:34:29.569 --> 03:34:30.672
TALIESIN: Nice metaphor, by the way.

5024
03:34:30.672 --> 03:34:34.424
MATT: That was unintentional, but here we are.

5025
03:34:34.424 --> 03:34:36.379
Anyway, we love you guys very much.

5026
03:34:36.379 --> 03:34:38.003
Have a wonderful week and weekend,

5027
03:34:38.003 --> 03:34:40.733
and is it Thursday yet?

5028
03:34:40.733 --> 03:34:41.629
Good night.

5029
03:34:41.629 --> 03:34:43.218
(cheering)

5030
03:34:43.218 --> 03:34:46.051
(epic rock music)

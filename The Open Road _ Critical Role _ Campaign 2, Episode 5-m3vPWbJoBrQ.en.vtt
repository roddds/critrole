00:00:00.288 --> 00:00:04.119
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:04.119 --> 00:00:10.189
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons. Some of us are mentally

00:00:10.189 --> 00:00:18.179
lagging a little, but that's okay. It's been a
long day. Welcome, guys. Before we jump into

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:22.497
tonight's session, we're going to do some quick
announcements. First and foremost, thank you to

00:00:22.497 --> 00:00:28.184
our returning sponsor and partner at the start of
this campaign, and for the foreseeable, amorphous

00:00:28.184 --> 00:00:33.658
future of which they wish to come along with us on
this journey, D&amp;amp;D Beyond. They've been awesome and

00:00:33.658 --> 00:00:36.806
I actually just learned today of a really helpful
functionality that I probably should have known

00:00:36.806 --> 00:00:41.110
about, where you can create your own campaign in
there and then send out a link to all your players

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.843
and their characters get added to your campaign.
Now I have access to all of your character sheets

00:00:43.843 --> 00:00:48.971
at all times, which alleviates me having to text
you all, "What's your maximum hit points now?" and

00:00:48.971 --> 00:00:49.928
all that shit.

00:00:49.928 --> 00:00:53.358
LAURA: Did you just have them? Or do we need to
send you our characters?

00:00:53.358 --> 00:00:55.876
MATT: Well no, I sent out the link earlier today
and you're one of the only ones who hasn't

00:00:55.876 --> 00:00:58.456
responded yet, but you will, later, that's okay.

00:00:58.456 --> 00:01:00.624
LAURA: I didn't see it, I was recording.

00:01:00.624 --> 00:01:02.342
MATT: That's okay, so were we.

00:01:02.342 --> 00:01:06.001
(laughter)

00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:07.531
LAURA: I didn't look at my phone.

00:01:07.531 --> 00:01:08.633
TRAVIS: What a dick.

00:01:08.633 --> 00:01:10.913
(laughter)

00:01:10.913 --> 00:01:12.380
MATT: It's all good.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.493
LAURA: That means all of you guys were texting in
your sessions.

00:01:14.493 --> 00:01:15.839
TALIESIN: This is true.

00:01:15.839 --> 00:01:17.433
LIAM: We're that good.

00:01:17.433 --> 00:01:20.570
(laughter)

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.076
MATT: Sam, do you have any words you wanted to say
about our sponsor?

00:01:23.076 --> 00:01:25.232
SAM: I do. Here, give this to Matt, he'll need it.

00:01:25.232 --> 00:01:26.173
MATT: Oh no.

00:01:26.173 --> 00:01:30.789
SAM: Our partner this week is once again D&amp;amp;D
Beyond, that's dndbeyond.com. The big news is that

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:37.138
D&amp;amp;D's newest book, Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes, is
available for pre-order now on the site. If you

00:01:37.138 --> 00:01:42.107
preorder, you'll get exclusive character portrait
frames, sheet backdrops, and themed colors that you

00:01:42.107 --> 00:01:46.742
can use with upcoming character sheet updates! I
don't know what that means but it sounds awesome.

00:01:46.742 --> 00:01:53.950
The $10 off code "beginnings" can be applied to
your preorder. To celebrate, I'm going to

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:00.702
personally be giving away one copy of this book to
either Travis, Liam, or Marisha, but they have to

00:02:00.702 --> 00:02:05.459
compete for it. Here's the rules: I'm going to
give you a race, class, and character description,

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:11.812
just like you can do on D&amp;amp;D Beyond, and all you
guys have to do is come up with the name of that

00:02:11.812 --> 00:02:20.116
character. Laura, Taliesin, and Matt will be the
judges. Best out of three wins, all right? You

00:02:20.116 --> 00:02:25.003
just have to come up with a name for this
character, ready? A male stout halfling swamp

00:02:25.003 --> 00:02:31.427
druid who only wears a diaper made out of kelp and
loves to Wild Shape into manatees. Liam, what is

00:02:31.427 --> 00:02:32.703
the name of that character?

00:02:32.703 --> 00:02:34.091
LIAM: Twill Pillikins.

00:02:34.091 --> 00:02:35.771
SAM: Marisha, what is the name of that character?

00:02:35.771 --> 00:02:37.431
MARISHA: Squall Squatlock.

00:02:37.431 --> 00:02:38.455
SAM: And Travis?

00:02:38.455 --> 00:02:39.631
TRAVIS: Merkin Dullbringer.

00:02:39.631 --> 00:02:47.459
SAM: Judges, who wins? Oh, Travis, easy win for
Travis.

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.648
MATT: Adding Merkin to a swamp druid was too
easy.

00:02:49.648 --> 00:02:52.270
LAURA: It was you, Liam, until he brought up the
Merkin.

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.286
SAM: Remember, these characters can all be made on
D&amp;amp;D Beyond. The next one is a male tabaxi bard

00:02:56.286 --> 00:03:02.921
with an electric guitar who constantly plays K-pop
songs and has a runny nose. What is his name? Liam O'Brien.

00:03:02.921 --> 00:03:04.864
LIAM: Bathtub Stealthcat.

00:03:04.864 --> 00:03:08.075
SAM: Marisha Ray. Oh yeah, sorry, three names.

00:03:08.075 --> 00:03:15.636
MARISHA: Mollysquawk the J-pop Hadockhop.

00:03:15.636 --> 00:03:17.202
SAM: Yep, okay. Travis?

00:03:17.202 --> 00:03:18.415
TRAVIS: Pubert Pimplepop.

00:03:18.415 --> 00:03:19.897
SAM: Ooh! Judges.

00:03:19.897 --> 00:03:21.504
TALIESIN: I got bribed.

00:03:21.504 --> 00:03:25.293
SAM: Travis again.

00:03:25.293 --> 00:03:27.857
TALIESIN: I'm purchasable, putting that out
there.

00:03:27.857 --> 00:03:33.186
SAM: One more, this one is worth two points. A
female kenku paladin with no arms or legs.

00:03:33.186 --> 00:03:34.594
LAURA: What's a kenku?

00:03:34.594 --> 00:03:35.917
LIAM: Kenku's a bird.

00:03:35.917 --> 00:03:37.841
LAURA: Yeah, I know. Shut up!

00:03:37.841 --> 00:03:43.793
SAM: Who worships the lobster-headed god
Blibdoolpoolp, and it is a real god, and is

00:03:43.793 --> 00:03:48.331
dragged around by a pack of reindeer. Liam, what
is the name of that character?

00:03:48.331 --> 00:03:50.299
LIAM: Dagon Henry Kissinger.

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:56.886
MARISHA: Madame Mannequin Ba-Deece.

00:03:56.886 --> 00:04:00.949
TRAVIS: Filma Kraken.

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:10.078
SAM: Judges, Liam, Liam, Marisha, Liam gets two
points! Travis gets two points! Marisha wins!

00:04:10.078 --> 00:04:12.838
MARISHA: Yay, golf rules!

00:04:12.838 --> 00:04:20.183
SAM: I will personally buy you one of those books,
Marisha, hold me to it. D&amp;amp;D Beyond, everyone, make

00:04:20.183 --> 00:04:22.099
your character today.

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:23.771
MATT: Thank you Sam, thank you very much.

00:04:23.771 --> 00:04:24.769
LAURA: That was good.

00:04:24.769 --> 00:04:26.110
TALIESIN: That got weird.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.570
MATT: Isn't it always, though?

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.640
LAURA: That was close, I'm not going to count it.
This is the one Sam gave me, so we'll see.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:37.669
MATT: Finishing up from that, we have Talks Machina
next Tuesday at 7:00pm Pacific here on Twitch and

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:44.232
Project Alpha to discuss tonight's episode of
Critical Role hosted by our fantastic Brian W.

00:04:44.232 --> 00:04:50.151
Foster, so check that out on Tuesday next week. We
have a new show called Weave coming up, Marisha, do

00:04:50.151 --> 00:04:51.099
you want to explain this a little bit?

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:52.616
TALIESIN: We're one episode in.

00:04:52.616 --> 00:04:55.072
MATT: One episode in? That's right, that launched this
week.

00:04:55.072 --> 00:04:57.081
MARISHA: Yeah, it happened... last night?

00:04:57.081 --> 00:04:58.310
TALIESIN: Wednesday night.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:05.916
MARISHA: Wednesday night, it happens after
Wednesday Club. It's being GMed by Amy Dallen and

00:05:05.916 --> 00:05:16.417
it's an interactive storytelling RPG game. It's
got all the ladies of Geek &amp;amp; Sundry, so check it out.

00:05:16.417 --> 00:05:17.813
MATT: That's awesome.

00:05:17.813 --> 00:05:19.821
TRAVIS: That's a dope jacket, by the way.

00:05:19.821 --> 00:05:21.122
MARISHA: Thanks, man.

00:05:21.122 --> 00:05:22.424
TRAVIS: Yeah, jealous.

00:05:22.424 --> 00:05:29.290
MATT: We'll get you one, same size. Last week's
episode of Critical Role is available in podcast

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:34.222
form wherever you can find the greatest podcasts to
download. So if you have friends who are listening

00:05:34.222 --> 00:05:40.409
to the audio, they can do so now and be caught up
with you up until after tonight. Also, comic book

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:44.668
issue four of Critical Role: Vox Machina Origins
is available for digital download anywhere where you can

00:05:44.668 --> 00:05:48.955
find digital comics for the most part: ComiXology,
the Dark Horse app, and other great places.

00:05:48.997 --> 00:05:53.682
TRAVIS: It's so good, Minxie's in there killing things.

00:05:53.682 --> 00:05:56.179
MATT: We've got a new one creeping up on the
horizon.

00:05:56.179 --> 00:05:58.385
LIAM: I've read the whole thing, I've seen the
pictures.

00:05:58.385 --> 00:06:07.016
MATT: I was supposed to see the art today! I can't
wait! Anyway, enough of that. Of course, our

00:06:07.016 --> 00:06:14.598
fantastic 826LA and the 826 group that does
fantastic after-school programs for kids to get

00:06:14.598 --> 00:06:19.629
into creative writing. Check it out if you haven't
already, and if you can't give to help out with

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:23.379
this charity, you can donate your time as well to
help teach some of these kids and help expand

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:27.670
their imaginations, so check it out. They're
awesome people and we continue to support and push

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:33.513
them forward. Any new appearances you want to
announce? Or just rinse and repeat the ones-- if

00:06:33.513 --> 00:06:36.879
you want to know what conventions we're going to
be at in the near future, watch last week's

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:44.237
episode. Otherwise it gets monotonous for us.
Anyway, any other announcements that I've missed?

00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:47.894
SAM: Apparently my breath stinks, so if anyone has
any gum, I'll take it.

00:06:47.894 --> 00:06:52.474
MATT: Send your gum to Geek &amp;amp; Sundry.

00:06:52.474 --> 00:06:54.643
TALIESIN: Don't send your gum.

00:06:54.643 --> 00:07:04.324
LAURA: I have something. The Shadow of War
expansion pack, The Blade of Galadriel, came out

00:07:04.324 --> 00:07:09.091
and you can play and be me, so get it and play.

00:07:09.091 --> 00:07:10.844
SAM: Just you, Laura Bailey?

00:07:10.844 --> 00:07:13.741
LAURA: Yeah, basically just me, running around
Mordor.

00:07:13.741 --> 00:07:16.990
LIAM: Donut hole! Donut hole! Donut
hole!

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.615
TRAVIS: You've got a ring of power and shit.

00:07:19.615 --> 00:07:21.127
LAURA: Yeah, so check it out.

00:07:21.127 --> 00:07:22.858
LIAM: She has a ring of power?

00:07:22.858 --> 00:07:25.477
LAURA: Shut up! What? No. What?

00:07:25.477 --> 00:07:34.599
MATT: On that note, let's go ahead and dive in to
tonight's episode of Critical Role.

00:07:34.599 --> 00:07:36.862
(cast singing)

00:07:36.862 --> 00:07:40.739
[click, TV static]

00:07:40.739 --> 00:08:58.379
[groovy Critical Role theme]

00:08:58.455 --> 00:08:59.877
MATT: And welcome back.

00:08:59.877 --> 00:09:01.899
LAURA: He just tunes it out now.

00:09:01.899 --> 00:09:03.400
MATT: I have to.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.463
LIAM: Except when he doesn't.

00:09:04.463 --> 00:09:07.514
MATT: Except when I don't, which makes it a
challenge for you guys, which does not help me.

00:09:07.514 --> 00:09:14.343
Anyway, last we left off, the group of adventurers
whose fates are slowly entwining found themselves

00:09:14.343 --> 00:09:18.535
meeting in the city of Trostenwald on the southern
reaches of the Dwendalian Empire on the continent

00:09:18.535 --> 00:09:24.019
of Wildemount. Through a mishap in a circus
passing through town, you began to give chase to

00:09:24.019 --> 00:09:30.644
the investigation that has caught you up in this legal
issue and you found yourselves locked under house

00:09:30.644 --> 00:09:36.598
arrest and being considered possible murderers.
You sought the answer to this endeavor, you found

00:09:36.598 --> 00:09:41.818
the devil toad, or the nergaliid, as you
discovered, was responsible. You hunted it down,

00:09:41.818 --> 00:09:46.024
slew it, brought its head back, and after arguing
with a very tired and wanting to get it over with

00:09:46.024 --> 00:09:52.542
lawmaster in Trostenwald, managed to convince her
enough to let you off the hook and leave most of

00:09:52.542 --> 00:09:56.762
the standing legal issues with Gustav, thus
disbanding the circus and setting you and Yasha

00:09:56.762 --> 00:10:01.881
free. Yasha went on her own path while the rest of
you, the six of you, decided strength in numbers,

00:10:01.881 --> 00:10:06.745
and at the time being, you all seem to enjoy each
other's company. Purchasing a fresh

00:10:06.745 --> 00:10:13.226
map, looking at your future prospects and your
dwindling funds, you decided to head northward,

00:10:13.226 --> 00:10:19.421
towards the city of Zadash by way of the Golden
Road, past the city of Alfield. And that is where

00:10:19.421 --> 00:10:25.818
we left off, as you had smacked the rear end of
the single horse and cart, and sent it spooked

00:10:25.818 --> 00:10:27.860
into the northern field.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.810
LAURA: We chased after it, right?

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:33.971
MATT: You do. You chase after it to keep up.

00:10:33.971 --> 00:10:36.016
LAURA: We don't just lose it.

00:10:36.016 --> 00:10:45.537
MATT: Being relatively before noon at this point
in time, you're heading northward along the Amber

00:10:45.537 --> 00:10:49.517
Road. The well-packed dirt of the ten-foot roadway
gives you a clear path towards your next

00:10:49.517 --> 00:10:54.558
destination. The gentle creak of the cart mingles
with the clomping of the horse hooves as you push

00:10:54.558 --> 00:11:00.458
forward. The midday air is warmer than you
expected. The sky's common gray presence is broken

00:11:00.458 --> 00:11:06.786
into smaller cloud patches, the victorious blue
peeking through. You guys continue for a few hours,

00:11:06.786 --> 00:11:12.421
talking amongst yourselves a bit. If there are any
questions you wish to ask each other, now is

00:11:12.421 --> 00:11:14.385
the time.

00:11:14.385 --> 00:11:16.171
SAM: Any questions?

00:11:16.171 --> 00:11:19.317
MATT: Meaning if there is anything coming out of
the city you wanted to talk about, otherwise I'm

00:11:19.317 --> 00:11:22.330
going to continue to push forward with your
journey. So stop me at any point.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:28.762
TRAVIS: Is Beau-- is her face all jibbity-jacked,
or is it pretty normal-looking at this point?

00:11:28.762 --> 00:11:30.677
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:11:30.677 --> 00:11:37.119
TRAVIS: Not that I watched anything from last week,
because I didn't! 16.

00:11:37.119 --> 00:11:46.263
MATT: You can see there is some faint bruising
starting to show on the left side of the face.

00:11:46.263 --> 00:11:56.509
TRAVIS: I bet she doesn't want to talk about that.
That's a good shiner.

00:11:56.509 --> 00:11:59.238
MARISHA: Thanks.

00:11:59.238 --> 00:12:02.881
TRAVIS: Did you give as good as you got?

00:12:02.881 --> 00:12:15.931
MARISHA: I wouldn't say I &lt;i&gt;won&lt;/i&gt;, because I lost.
But I did pretty good. What color is it right now?

00:12:15.931 --> 00:12:17.833
Is it in that orange-ish purple--

00:12:17.833 --> 00:12:21.925
TRAVIS: It's got the green-yellow sunset
happening, things are starting to spread. Tomorrow

00:12:21.925 --> 00:12:22.957
will be--

00:12:22.957 --> 00:12:25.075
MARISHA: Right. Got that little orangey. Mm-hmm.

00:12:25.075 --> 00:12:26.628
LAURA: It's really pretty.

00:12:26.628 --> 00:12:27.809
MARISHA: Thanks.

00:12:27.809 --> 00:12:29.809
TALIESIN: Significant improvement.

00:12:29.809 --> 00:12:36.233
TRAVIS: That trouble going to follow you as we go
on our way, or do you think you're free and clear?

00:12:36.233 --> 00:12:47.864
MARISHA: Oh no, that was just a little bar fight.
Nothing. Just a little friendly sparring. Nothing crazy.

00:12:47.864 --> 00:12:49.893
TRAVIS: Nice.

00:12:49.893 --> 00:12:52.657
LAURA: Does anyone want a donut from my bag?

00:12:52.657 --> 00:12:54.144
TALIESIN: Yes, I'll have a donut, thank you,
please.

00:12:54.144 --> 00:12:56.252
LIAM: I would also like a donut, please.

00:12:56.252 --> 00:13:02.349
LAURA: Okay, here you go. I don't have them in
real life, just this one in real life. But in the

00:13:02.349 --> 00:13:04.952
game, you guys are having delicious donuts.

00:13:04.952 --> 00:13:07.085
TRAVIS: How old are those donuts?

00:13:07.085 --> 00:13:08.985
LIAM: Do you actually have donuts? I don't
understand.

00:13:08.985 --> 00:13:10.496
LAURA: Yeah, here you go.

00:13:10.496 --> 00:13:12.763
LIAM: Oh, there it is.

00:13:12.763 --> 00:13:14.740
MATT: Imagination!

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:17.528
LAURA: You're doing it, Peter, you're doing it!

00:13:17.528 --> 00:13:21.757
TALIESIN: I was just going there, damn it!
Bangarang!

00:13:21.757 --> 00:13:29.289
LAURA: These donuts are not &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; old.

00:13:29.289 --> 00:13:31.810
TALIESIN: What does "not that old" mean, does it
mean they're young?

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:32.987
LIAM: Are they pretty new?

00:13:32.987 --> 00:13:34.812
LAURA: They're pretty new, yes.

00:13:34.812 --> 00:13:40.409
LIAM: Three days new? Or-- Forget it, I don't
actually want to know the answer.

00:13:40.409 --> 00:13:42.680
LAURA: Just eat it, it's good.

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:45.894
TALIESIN: Is it good and do we gain or lose hit
points?

00:13:45.894 --> 00:13:53.446
MATT: No hit point transition, no constitution
saves. They're a bit stale, but still tasty enough.

00:13:53.446 --> 00:13:57.862
TRAVIS: Any lint from the bag that they were being
held in?

00:13:57.862 --> 00:14:03.682
MATT: You can chose to remove it if you'd like,
but it may be part of the texture. It adds color.

00:14:03.682 --> 00:14:05.951
LAURA: That's right. It's like sprinkles.

00:14:05.951 --> 00:14:11.582
LIAM: Mollymauk, is this weird for you to not be
traveling with your performing family?

00:14:11.582 --> 00:14:15.612
TALIESIN: It's change, but travel is travel, so.

00:14:15.612 --> 00:14:20.844
LAURA: Did you travel in a wagon when you were
with your family?

00:14:20.844 --> 00:14:25.205
TALIESIN: Oh yes, we traveled forever. It was
constantly on the road. Once we left home, we

00:14:25.205 --> 00:14:27.060
stayed moving.

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:31.201
MATT: Ironically, traveled in the exact wagon that
you're in right now.

00:14:31.201 --> 00:14:33.229
LAURA: Oh, nice.

00:14:33.229 --> 00:14:40.388
LIAM: Some things don't change. We didn't have
much of a chance to see you perform. I saw you do

00:14:40.388 --> 00:14:46.706
a card reading for Jester, but things got waylaid
at the circus. What do you normally do?

00:14:46.706 --> 00:14:53.180
TALIESIN: Oh, things. I'm not really much of a
performer, I'm more of-- Help set up. Help run the

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:56.652
shows, help make illusions, that sort of thing.

00:14:56.652 --> 00:14:59.532
SAM: Like a techie?

00:14:59.532 --> 00:15:05.083
TALIESIN: I guess you could say a techie. I show
off a little bit of the sword juggling.

00:15:05.083 --> 00:15:06.529
SAM: Oh!

00:15:06.529 --> 00:15:09.244
TALIESIN: I've got some things I was working on.
Like this.

00:15:09.244 --> 00:15:11.622
TRAVIS: You juggling those big motherfucking
swords?

00:15:11.622 --> 00:15:12.777
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:15:12.777 --> 00:15:16.529
MATT: You watch as he balances one on the edge of
the hand and then tosses it up and catches it as

00:15:16.529 --> 00:15:21.407
it falls, and takes the other one and glides it
across, spins it up, catches it on his chin. On

00:15:21.407 --> 00:15:23.624
his nose; he makes it hop around. It's pretty
decent.

00:15:23.624 --> 00:15:24.696
TALIESIN: Little roll.

00:15:24.696 --> 00:15:26.259
LAURA: Can you swallow it?

00:15:26.259 --> 00:15:29.160
MATT: Make an acrobatics check if you want to
try.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:32.294
TALIESIN: Well, it's a curved sword. So not the
curved ones. But I could probably do a straight

00:15:32.294 --> 00:15:36.183
sword. I'm not going to swallow a curved sword!
That would be very complicated to pull off.

00:15:36.183 --> 00:15:38.724
LIAM: If anybody can do it, it's you.

00:15:38.724 --> 00:15:42.493
SAM: That tiefling anatomy is very strange, you
know.

00:15:42.493 --> 00:15:50.565
TALIESIN: I'm flexible, but not that flexible. I'm
pretty flexible. Yeah, I never nailed anything

00:15:50.565 --> 00:15:53.022
down for a really good act.

00:15:53.022 --> 00:16:02.524
MATT: A few hours into travel along the road, you
catch ahead the sight of another caravan heading

00:16:02.524 --> 00:16:07.483
southward in your direction. They begin to crest
over one of the hills. As you look forward, too,

00:16:07.483 --> 00:16:14.092
the central portion of the Marrow Valley isn't
just a smooth, constant grade. It's a series of

00:16:14.092 --> 00:16:19.662
rolling hills and high grasses and wheats and
grains, and a lot of wild weeds that have taken

00:16:19.662 --> 00:16:24.339
over the areas between bastions of civilization.

00:16:24.339 --> 00:16:26.196
LIAM: How far away are they?

00:16:26.196 --> 00:16:30.655
MATT: You can see up there about maybe a half mile
or so, as they crest over one of the hills in the distance.

00:16:30.655 --> 00:16:36.845
LIAM: Yeah, I send Frumpkin ahead and see it, and
go blind and deaf here, so I can get a closer look

00:16:36.845 --> 00:16:37.868
at them.

00:16:37.868 --> 00:16:39.056
SAM: Which is Frumpkin now?

00:16:39.056 --> 00:16:43.752
LIAM: Frumpkin's a sparrow at the moment. I don't
have the components to put him back to the shape

00:16:43.752 --> 00:16:45.560
he prefers, which is a cat.

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.038
LAURA: What are the components?

00:16:47.038 --> 00:16:54.327
LIAM: Charcoal and some incense, a kind of incense
you have to use. I'm all out. I used it all.

00:16:54.327 --> 00:16:55.833
TALIESIN: Not my incense.

00:16:55.833 --> 00:16:57.206
LIAM: No.

00:16:57.206 --> 00:16:58.871
TRAVIS: Is there money involved?

00:16:58.871 --> 00:17:02.109
LIAM: Money? Well, you have to pay money to get
the things to do it.

00:17:02.109 --> 00:17:03.232
TRAVIS: Right, I'm sorry.

00:17:03.232 --> 00:17:07.131
LIAM: He's been a couple of things before. He can
last. Anyway. Off you go.

00:17:07.131 --> 00:17:09.082
LAURA: Have you ever made him a turtle?

00:17:09.082 --> 00:17:10.494
MATT: He can't hear you right now, unfortunately.

00:17:10.494 --> 00:17:14.127
LAURA: Have you ever made him a snake? Have you
ever made him a roach?

00:17:14.127 --> 00:17:17.324
SAM: He's gone to the other place. He won't be
able to respond.

00:17:17.324 --> 00:17:19.532
LAURA: Have you ever made him a unicorn?

00:17:19.532 --> 00:17:20.958
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:22.965
SAM: A unicorn would be really cool.

00:17:22.965 --> 00:17:24.697
MARISHA: That would be really cool.

00:17:24.697 --> 00:17:26.055
TALIESIN: I'd like to see that.

00:17:26.055 --> 00:17:27.705
LAURA: They exist, you know.

00:17:27.705 --> 00:17:29.285
TALIESIN: I didn't know that.

00:17:29.285 --> 00:17:30.370
LAURA: They do.

00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:39.157
MATT: As your vision crests up with the flight of
Frumpkin, make a perception check for Frumpkin.

00:17:39.157 --> 00:17:45.048
LIAM: Don't fuck me, Scanlan. Oh, that's not
Scanlan, that's Percy, but you did fuck me, Percy.

00:17:45.048 --> 00:17:47.118
TALIESIN: I try.

00:17:47.118 --> 00:17:50.211
LIAM: That is very low. We'll just say it fails,
because it's a two.

00:17:50.211 --> 00:17:51.291
MATT: It's a two?

00:17:51.291 --> 00:17:52.584
LIAM: Yeah, I rolled a two.

00:17:52.584 --> 00:17:56.842
MATT: Okay. I mean, at a safe enough distance to
look down, there are shapes. The most that

00:17:56.842 --> 00:18:01.199
Frumpkin makes out is that it looks to be six
heavy wagons.

00:18:01.199 --> 00:18:05.293
MARISHA and LAURA: Six?

00:18:05.293 --> 00:18:08.424
MATT: Six heavy wagons, each being pulled by a
trio of horses.

00:18:08.424 --> 00:18:09.953
SAM: We can rob them.

00:18:09.953 --> 00:18:11.442
LIAM: 18 horses.

00:18:11.442 --> 00:18:13.053
TRAVIS: We should what?

00:18:13.053 --> 00:18:17.403
SAM: Well, we could rob them, or we could go off
the road and hide and wait for them to pass.

00:18:17.403 --> 00:18:19.192
LAURA: Is Frumpkin back? Do we know all these
things yet?

00:18:19.192 --> 00:18:20.485
SAM: Oh, we don't.

00:18:20.485 --> 00:18:22.319
MATT: We'll say for the purposes of this--

00:18:22.319 --> 00:18:24.180
SAM: Pleasant day!

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:31.509
LIAM: I started muttering as soon as I could see
that. What they were, what I saw.

00:18:31.509 --> 00:18:34.348
LAURA: Do they look like they're in armor? Do they
look like they're soldiers?

00:18:34.348 --> 00:18:36.184
SAM: He can't hear you.

00:18:36.184 --> 00:18:38.149
LAURA: Do they look like they're mean?

00:18:38.149 --> 00:18:39.334
TALIESIN: Do they look like they're unicorns?

00:18:39.334 --> 00:18:42.489
MARISHA: Do they look like they're traders? Like
&lt;i&gt;traders&lt;/i&gt;, not traitors.

00:18:42.489 --> 00:18:43.655
SAM: He can't hear you.

00:18:43.655 --> 00:18:47.308
LAURA: Do you see, are they carrying money? Are
they carrying people?

00:18:47.308 --> 00:18:55.066
SAM: He won't be able to talk to you for a while.
You see, he's not really there.

00:18:55.066 --> 00:19:01.774
MATT: Coming closer down the road now, the gap
between your traveling troupe and this caravan

00:19:01.774 --> 00:19:07.450
grows smaller and smaller. All the rest of you,
I'd like to make a perception check, please. I

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:08.731
think at this point, Frumpkin has--

00:19:08.731 --> 00:19:11.482
LIAM: I would've released it, yeah. He's not back,
but I released the sight.

00:19:11.482 --> 00:19:14.124
TRAVIS: 17.

00:19:14.124 --> 00:19:16.056
LIAM: Perception check?

00:19:16.056 --> 00:19:17.288
SAM: Nine!

00:19:17.288 --> 00:19:18.376
TALIESIN: 20.

00:19:18.376 --> 00:19:19.346
MARISHA: 17.

00:19:19.346 --> 00:19:20.280
LAURA: Five!

00:19:20.366 --> 00:19:21.190
LIAM: Zwölf.

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:25.004
MATT: Amongst all of you guys keeping an eye out,
you look ahead and you can see the wagons are

00:19:25.004 --> 00:19:29.600
covered, some of them are bundled; some of them
are taller; some of them are smaller. What you do

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:36.159
notice is at the front of each of the wagons,
there's a figure with the reins that is in the

00:19:36.159 --> 00:19:41.081
process of sitting there and occasionally making
sure the pace is kept relatively steady forward.

00:19:41.081 --> 00:19:47.480
You do see by the long robes and ornate silk
mantles of the highwaymen that are holding these

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:53.028
reins, you get the impression that they probably
are from the Menagerie Coast. You two in

00:19:53.028 --> 00:20:02.232
particular recognize, it's not well-off mercantile
clothing, but it looks like it's not rags for a

00:20:02.232 --> 00:20:05.724
person that makes this trek up and down the Amber
Road. Looks like they're heading southward,

00:20:05.724 --> 00:20:11.182
probably returning after completing some sort of a
trade run up to either Zadash or Rexxentrum and

00:20:11.182 --> 00:20:19.542
spaces nearby. As the gap begins to close, there's
a brief moment of chicken to see who's going to

00:20:19.542 --> 00:20:25.773
avert the path as it's only about ten foot wide.
It would be a pretty tight fit to get both your

00:20:25.773 --> 00:20:29.260
troupe and their wagons past. Do you guys yield or
do you continue to push forward?

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:34.413
TRAVIS: I would just like to suggest we might give
way. There are six of them.

00:20:34.413 --> 00:20:35.578
TALIESIN: I'm fine with that.

00:20:35.578 --> 00:20:36.691
MARISHA: Yes, agreed.

00:20:36.691 --> 00:20:37.688
LAURA: Yeah.

00:20:37.688 --> 00:20:41.853
MATT: You guys skirt your single horse-- poor
thing is pulling this cart on its own.

00:20:41.853 --> 00:20:45.421
TRAVIS: We're going to kill it.

00:20:45.421 --> 00:20:49.453
MATT: It's not going any faster, really, than you
guys walking, necessarily.

00:20:49.453 --> 00:20:51.374
(laughter)

00:20:51.374 --> 00:20:52.897
LAURA: But we get to be lazy.

00:20:52.897 --> 00:20:54.495
TRAVIS: But we're not walking.

00:20:54.495 --> 00:20:57.423
(laughter)

00:20:57.423 --> 00:21:01.202
MATT: Because it is not a riding horse, it is a
beast of burden, so it's about the same pace that

00:21:01.202 --> 00:21:07.005
you're going. As you guys pull slightly off into
the grass, the cart bumps as it hits some rocks

00:21:07.005 --> 00:21:14.338
and patches of dirt and thick grass. They continue
to pass, and as they do, you see the individuals.

00:21:14.338 --> 00:21:19.026
The one in the front has what looks to be a thick
scarf tossed over the shoulder obscuring part of

00:21:19.026 --> 00:21:24.590
the face, and she gives a hand salute up to you as
it passes and a bit of a head nod. As you wave your

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:27.669
hand frantically, a bit of eye contact is made and
continues past.

00:21:27.669 --> 00:21:29.579
LAURA: Are you going to Nicodranas?

00:21:29.579 --> 00:21:32.453
MATT: No response. The first cart continues past.

00:21:32.453 --> 00:21:35.020
LAURA: Hi. Hi, are you going to Nicodranas?

00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:42.592
MATT: The next one looks over to you for a second,
the head cocked a little bit. "No, we are on our

00:21:42.592 --> 00:21:44.234
"way to Port Zoon."

00:21:44.234 --> 00:21:45.642
LAURA: Oh.

00:21:45.642 --> 00:21:47.222
MATT: "By way of Nicodranas."

00:21:47.222 --> 00:21:49.415
LAURA: Oh! Did you come from Zadash?

00:21:49.415 --> 00:21:54.888
MATT: "We briefly did, yes, but we are returning.
We have finished our wares and we have things to

00:21:54.888 --> 00:21:56.697
"bring back to sell."

00:21:56.697 --> 00:21:59.839
LAURA: How far is it to Zadash?

00:21:59.839 --> 00:22:04.826
MATT: "Uh..." At this point he's passed by you and
his voice gets a bit louder over his shoulder and

00:22:04.826 --> 00:22:09.720
he's like, "From this point, it's probably around
150 miles."

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.502
LAURA: Thank you!

00:22:11.502 --> 00:22:16.670
MATT: The next one continues, one after another.
You get a better look, too. The ones at the front

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:20.893
that were pretty heavily covered, as opposed to
the ones in the back which are a little taller,

00:22:20.893 --> 00:22:24.477
and as you look into the back, there's little
flaps and openings on the inside, you can see

00:22:24.477 --> 00:22:26.276
there's families traveling.

00:22:26.276 --> 00:22:31.372
MARISHA: Does it look like they have any wares
that they're traveling to trade?

00:22:31.372 --> 00:22:35.017
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:22:35.017 --> 00:22:44.110
MARISHA: That's a 16, I think. Yeah. 19.

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:50.802
MATT: Glancing through, you can see the three
wagons towards the back seem to be more for

00:22:50.802 --> 00:22:55.391
transport of people. It seems like either these
merchants are bringing their family with them for

00:22:55.391 --> 00:23:01.866
long treks, so they're not apart from them for so
long, or their family is just a family of traders

00:23:01.866 --> 00:23:07.439
or transport. Looking past them, you can see there
are a lot of supplies behind them, but you're not sure

00:23:07.439 --> 00:23:11.436
if they're wares or just their personal goods.

00:23:11.436 --> 00:23:14.541
TRAVIS: Molly, feel like making some coin, doing a
little bit of a show?

00:23:14.541 --> 00:23:16.780
TALIESIN: Hmm.

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:21.427
MATT: The fifth cart's now passed. You're moving
on to the sixth cart.

00:23:21.427 --> 00:23:24.510
TALIESIN: Do these people look like they're in the
mood to stop?

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:26.270
MARISHA: Yeah, do they look sad?

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:27.358
MATT: Make an insight check.

00:23:27.358 --> 00:23:29.026
SAM: Do they look sad.

00:23:29.026 --> 00:23:32.073
TALIESIN: What's insight?

00:23:32.073 --> 00:23:35.108
LAURA: Plus five.

00:23:35.108 --> 00:23:39.539
TALIESIN: Oh, where do you see that? Oh! There it
is. Thank you. 19.

00:23:39.539 --> 00:23:46.035
MATT: They don't look sad necessarily. They're on
the road, just kind of looking out and keeping

00:23:46.035 --> 00:23:52.195
eyes on the vicinity and probably lost in thought.
You do see a pair of children, hard to gauge their

00:23:52.195 --> 00:23:59.146
age at this distance, but they're under the age of
ten at least, and they seem to look relatively bored.

00:23:59.146 --> 00:24:04.139
TALIESIN: I'll balance one of the swords on my
head and flash the cards and see if anybody bites.

00:24:04.139 --> 00:24:06.638
LAURA: As you drop them all over the ground.

00:24:06.638 --> 00:24:09.133
LIAM: Wakka wakka.

00:24:09.133 --> 00:24:18.166
MATT: You watch as the young boy, he has tangled
black hair that poofs out a bit on the sides, he

00:24:18.166 --> 00:24:23.186
has a deeper brown skin, and he looks up at you
with his bright blue eyes. As soon as you begin

00:24:23.186 --> 00:24:28.563
balancing the sword, he smiles a little bit and
jabs his elbow into his sister who's a little bit

00:24:28.563 --> 00:24:31.839
older than him, who glances over and points. They
both point towards you. You don't hear anything.

00:24:31.839 --> 00:24:36.281
They just point and smile as their cart pulls
away, the sixth cart making distance from you.

00:24:36.281 --> 00:24:38.502
LAURA: He can tell your fortune!

00:24:38.502 --> 00:24:40.509
TALIESIN: They didn't poke the parents.

00:24:40.509 --> 00:24:42.332
LAURA: They're stupid.

00:24:42.332 --> 00:24:46.165
MATT: The caravan continues without you.

00:24:46.165 --> 00:24:48.179
LAURA: Yeah!

00:24:48.179 --> 00:24:50.692
TALIESIN: Ah, it's very good.

00:24:50.692 --> 00:24:51.685
LAURA: Is it?

00:24:51.685 --> 00:24:52.422
TALIESIN: Yes.

00:24:52.422 --> 00:24:53.367
LAURA: What does it mean?

00:24:53.367 --> 00:24:55.150
TALIESIN: It means that you're on a cart.

00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:57.778
LAURA: It was the chariot.

00:24:57.778 --> 00:25:03.807
TRAVIS: Would you normally, you know, hijack a
caravan like that?

00:25:03.807 --> 00:25:10.380
SAM: I mean, we have in the past. If we are
confident we can get away with it, we would. We could--

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:12.397
TALIESIN: Can you get away with something like
that?

00:25:12.397 --> 00:25:16.923
SAM: There's a lot of people in that caravan
though, it seems like a risky maneuver.

00:25:16.923 --> 00:25:18.857
LIAM: That's a pretty big matzo ball there.

00:25:18.857 --> 00:25:22.342
TALIESIN: And stealing is wrong. But if you did
it, could you get away with it?

00:25:22.342 --> 00:25:25.866
SAM: We could probably get away with it. Why? You
want to follow them and rob their shit?

00:25:25.866 --> 00:25:29.392
TRAVIS: Just going off what you said earlier. I
don't want to change your behavior just because

00:25:29.392 --> 00:25:31.341
you're with us all of a sudden.

00:25:31.341 --> 00:25:34.997
SAM: I mean, sure. Let's go do it.

00:25:34.997 --> 00:25:37.040
LAURA: He's just trying to get you in trouble.

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:38.655
SAM: Oh, okay.

00:25:38.655 --> 00:25:40.575
TRAVIS: I am not. Merely asking a question.

00:25:40.575 --> 00:25:43.692
MARISHA: Would you join in in the stand off?

00:25:43.692 --> 00:25:46.180
TRAVIS: Wait, what does that--

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:50.000
MARISHA: Would you join the stagecoach robbery?

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:56.377
TRAVIS: If we're pointing them down, reach for the
sky!

00:25:56.377 --> 00:26:01.336
TALIESIN: Careful, those fingers are loaded.

00:26:01.336 --> 00:26:04.540
LIAM: Yeah, but I would ask. Are you asking
because that is something that you have no

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:08.401
experience with or are you wondering maybe is that
something that we could join you in?

00:26:08.401 --> 00:26:12.641
TRAVIS: Only because I have no experience in it, I
was just curious what it was that you might have

00:26:12.641 --> 00:26:14.673
done, you know, previously.

00:26:14.673 --> 00:26:17.826
LAURA: Did you hijack a cart?

00:26:17.826 --> 00:26:25.890
SAM: No, we were more small-time thieves. We
wouldn't typically hijack moving caravans. Usually

00:26:25.890 --> 00:26:29.724
we'd wait until they parked somewhere and then
just go sneak on and steal something out of the back.

00:26:29.724 --> 00:26:32.906
LIAM: Mostly whatever we can walk away with.

00:26:32.906 --> 00:26:39.433
MARISHA: The things with moving carts of that big
a family is they tend to prep. You don't know what

00:26:39.433 --> 00:26:41.343
kind of people or weapons they have with them.

00:26:41.343 --> 00:26:43.469
LIAM: Always go for a sure thing.

00:26:43.469 --> 00:26:47.068
MARISHA: You know how we're pretty sure that
everyone on this road's going to kill us? Yeah,

00:26:47.068 --> 00:26:48.700
everyone else thinks that, too.

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:50.830
TRAVIS: Fair enough.

00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:55.092
SAM: But if you need me to teach you how to steal,
you can tag along sometime.

00:26:55.092 --> 00:26:57.815
TRAVIS: I might take you up on that, yeah.

00:26:57.815 --> 00:26:59.287
SAM: All right.

00:26:59.287 --> 00:27:01.133
TALIESIN: Interesting.

00:27:01.133 --> 00:27:06.244
MATT: Continuing on your path, I want to ask which
two of you are taking point in keeping an eye on

00:27:06.244 --> 00:27:08.794
the road and the landscape around you as you
progress?

00:27:08.794 --> 00:27:10.366
TRAVIS: (fake cough) Beau.

00:27:10.366 --> 00:27:11.528
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll take watch.

00:27:11.528 --> 00:27:12.483
TRAVIS: Oh, sorry.

00:27:12.483 --> 00:27:13.841
MATT: Okay. Beau and who else?

00:27:13.841 --> 00:27:15.018
TRAVIS: So generous of you.

00:27:15.018 --> 00:27:16.067
LAURA: You want to do it?

00:27:16.067 --> 00:27:20.465
TALIESIN: I was going to say, yeah. I'll take a
round. I'm used to keeping an eye out on the road.

00:27:20.465 --> 00:27:24.590
MATT: So the two of you are taking point up until
you guys decide to change it when it comes to

00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:26.288
travel along the road.

00:27:26.288 --> 00:27:27.866
MARISHA: It's just general perception?

00:27:27.866 --> 00:27:33.742
MATT: Yes. I would like you both, currently about
an hour's journey past that intersection with the

00:27:33.742 --> 00:27:35.477
other caravan, to make a perception check.

00:27:35.477 --> 00:27:39.905
LAURA: Ooh! I bet someone's going to try to hijack
our shit on the road just like we were talking

00:27:39.905 --> 00:27:41.005
about then.

00:27:41.005 --> 00:27:42.957
MARISHA: Not too bad. 18.

00:27:42.957 --> 00:27:44.488
TRAVIS: Yeah! Smash.

00:27:44.488 --> 00:27:51.101
MATT: 18 and eight. Actually, both of you don't
really notice anything.

00:27:51.101 --> 00:27:54.492
MARISHA: Oh. Take that back. Take it back.

00:27:54.492 --> 00:27:59.103
MATT: Both of you keeping an eye out, the hills
continue to roll. You see patches of trees and

00:27:59.103 --> 00:28:05.518
small wooded areas. Grass field is tall but it's
beautiful and the light breeze that blows through,

00:28:05.518 --> 00:28:13.341
you can see the waves of wind as they come across.
You can hear the faint sound of it moving the

00:28:13.341 --> 00:28:14.736
fields across.

00:28:14.736 --> 00:28:18.367
MARISHA: Is there a tree that looks climbable that
I could get a vantage point?

00:28:18.367 --> 00:28:23.512
MATT: There is. It's maybe about 600 feet off the
road, but you can try and head over there if you

00:28:23.512 --> 00:28:25.040
want to.

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:28.442
TRAVIS: Plus we've been traveling for what? About
hour and a half, two hours now?

00:28:28.442 --> 00:28:30.500
MATT: I'd say total right now, you've been
probably on the road for about four hours.

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:31.585
MARISHA: Oh.

00:28:31.585 --> 00:28:34.091
TRAVIS: We should probably rest the &lt;i&gt;horse&lt;/i&gt; for
just a bit.

00:28:34.091 --> 00:28:37.231
(laughter)

00:28:37.231 --> 00:28:41.575
MARISHA: Sure. Anyone want to take a quick pee
break?

00:28:41.575 --> 00:28:42.811
LAURA: Yes.

00:28:42.811 --> 00:28:43.730
SAM: Yes, please.

00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:45.346
MARISHA: All right. Let's go over to the bushes.

00:28:45.346 --> 00:28:48.148
MATT: All right. So you guys leave the cart on the
road or do you take it off to the side?

00:28:48.148 --> 00:28:50.103
SAM: Should leave a guard with the--

00:28:50.103 --> 00:28:51.695
LAURA: We should lead it off the road.

00:28:51.695 --> 00:28:54.050
MARISHA: Can we take it with us fairly easily?

00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:58.753
MATT: I mean, you can. The progress will slow a
bit because you're now taking it through the hills

00:28:58.753 --> 00:29:00.920
and the field and having to push the cart through
the grass.

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:02.877
LIAM: No, we should take it off the road.

00:29:02.877 --> 00:29:04.871
LAURA: Just off the road a little bit.

00:29:04.871 --> 00:29:07.736
MARISHA: Just off the road but we don't have to go
all the way to the tree, I can--

00:29:07.736 --> 00:29:09.821
TALIESIN: I'll sit with the cart for the first
roll.

00:29:09.821 --> 00:29:11.178
TRAVIS: I'll stay with you.

00:29:11.178 --> 00:29:12.940
LIAM: Where are you going to do?

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:16.004
MARISHA: I'm just going to go check out this tree
over here. See if I can get a little better

00:29:16.004 --> 00:29:17.444
vantage.

00:29:17.444 --> 00:29:23.427
LIAM: Okay. I have a bird that can go probably
higher than the tree, if you want.

00:29:23.427 --> 00:29:25.245
MARISHA: Yeah, kind of forgot about that.

00:29:25.245 --> 00:29:27.465
LIAM: Would you like me to do that?

00:29:27.465 --> 00:29:29.518
LAURA: Maybe she likes climbing trees.

00:29:29.518 --> 00:29:32.524
LIAM: Or you could. I don't want to rob you of the
joy of climbing a good tree.

00:29:32.524 --> 00:29:35.624
TRAVIS: Or falling out of it, which we would
really enjoy.

00:29:35.624 --> 00:29:37.423
TALIESIN: That would be actually extremely--

00:29:37.423 --> 00:29:42.012
MARISHA: Both are very pleasant, but I do not
necessarily need that to feel fulfilled.

00:29:42.012 --> 00:29:49.433
LIAM: Okay. Well, I will sit in the field then and
give him a little chuck under the chin and-- oh,

00:29:49.433 --> 00:29:52.907
wait. Before I go away, am I looking for anything
specific?

00:29:52.907 --> 00:29:54.871
MARISHA: Just people coming.

00:29:54.871 --> 00:29:56.102
LIAM: People coming.

00:29:56.102 --> 00:30:01.214
MATT: As the rest of you take a moment to step off
to the side of the road, pull out some of your

00:30:01.214 --> 00:30:03.981
travel supplies to feed the horse, give it a
rest.

00:30:03.981 --> 00:30:05.186
LAURA: Pick some flowers.

00:30:05.186 --> 00:30:08.151
MATT: Pick some flowers, which you can find.
They're wildflowers. They're bright white,

00:30:08.151 --> 00:30:15.317
scattered and simple, but they're beautiful in their own
right. You all take a bit to relieve yourselves a

00:30:15.317 --> 00:30:19.342
little ways off the road. You make your way
towards the nearest tree and it's a cluster of

00:30:19.342 --> 00:30:23.329
about five or six that are nearby, this pocket
where it seems like some seeds long ago got

00:30:23.329 --> 00:30:29.907
dropped by a bird, probably, over the sky, and
then proceeded to grow and sprout. The lowest

00:30:29.907 --> 00:30:34.346
branch is about ten feet up, so you're going to
have to take a quick leap and try and climb some

00:30:34.346 --> 00:30:35.299
of it.

00:30:35.299 --> 00:30:36.487
MARISHA: I wanted to wait for Caleb.

00:30:36.487 --> 00:30:39.297
MATT: Oh, that's right, you're waiting there.
Never mind. You see that tree and you go, "I'll

00:30:39.297 --> 00:30:41.216
"get to that later."

00:30:41.216 --> 00:30:45.792
MARISHA: It's a damn good tree. I do miss climbing
trees.

00:30:45.792 --> 00:30:49.169
LAURA: Do you need me to lift you up to the
branch?

00:30:49.169 --> 00:30:50.757
MATT: Your eyes cloud over.

00:30:50.757 --> 00:30:55.295
LIAM: They do. As the bird is flying, just for a
second, I say: You know, ordinarily-- I can't hear

00:30:55.295 --> 00:31:00.738
you, but he's a cat almost all the time, so this
is a rarity. You'll be able to climb many trees,

00:31:00.738 --> 00:31:04.561
many other times, but we should take advantage of
him. Well, okay.

00:31:04.561 --> 00:31:08.753
LAURA: None of us were nearby when he was saying
all of that.

00:31:08.753 --> 00:31:11.671
MATT: No, you guys were quite a ways off. No one
was in earshot.

00:31:11.671 --> 00:31:13.824
TRAVIS: We were shitting in the bushes.

00:31:13.824 --> 00:31:17.984
MATT: A ladybug lands on his nose and goes in his
nostril, but he can't feel it.

00:31:17.984 --> 00:31:19.865
LIAM: Feel it?! I can feel stuff!

00:31:19.865 --> 00:31:22.336
MATT: Maybe not this. You're too focused.

00:31:22.336 --> 00:31:26.654
LIAM: We worked out that he could-- okay, great.
There's bugs in my nose.

00:31:26.654 --> 00:31:28.257
MATT: It tickles a little bit.

00:31:28.257 --> 00:31:30.640
LIAM: Shove it all in, everybody!

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:34.288
MATT: To be fair, your face itches in general from
the sheer amount of filth that's on it. It's hard

00:31:34.288 --> 00:31:36.459
to really differentiate.

00:31:36.459 --> 00:31:41.602
LIAM: In the middle of the field you hear: Ooh,
look at that! What do I see?

00:31:41.602 --> 00:31:44.531
MATT: Make a perception check for your birdie.

00:31:44.531 --> 00:31:46.502
LIAM: That's a nine.

00:31:46.502 --> 00:31:52.443
MATT: Glancing over and doing a wide pass around
as everyone begins to gather their things and head

00:31:52.443 --> 00:31:59.451
towards the cart, the road's pretty open. At this
point, the previous caravan is invisible from that

00:31:59.451 --> 00:32:03.466
height, the hills close that distance. You don't
see anything coming your way. It seems pretty open

00:32:03.466 --> 00:32:04.321
and safe.

00:32:04.321 --> 00:32:07.978
LIAM: Okay. I keep flying for a little bit
longer.

00:32:07.978 --> 00:32:09.257
MATT: Okay.

00:32:09.257 --> 00:32:11.814
LAURA: I lift Beau up to the branch just because.

00:32:11.814 --> 00:32:16.898
MARISHA: Okay. Feels like childhood. Do you want
up here?

00:32:16.898 --> 00:32:18.390
LAURA: Yeah, I'll jump!

00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:19.707
MARISHA: All right, I lift her up.

00:32:19.707 --> 00:32:21.474
LAURA: We sit up in the branches.

00:32:21.474 --> 00:32:23.370
MATT: Okay, cool. It's a nice view.

00:32:23.370 --> 00:32:27.282
(laughter)

00:32:27.282 --> 00:32:29.817
TRAVIS: It's impossible to believe him.

00:32:29.817 --> 00:32:33.087
MARISHA: Is there anything carved in the
branches, in the tree trunk?

00:32:33.087 --> 00:32:35.879
MATT: Make an investigation check.

00:32:35.879 --> 00:32:37.573
LIAM: The treant eats you.

00:32:37.573 --> 00:32:39.328
MATT: Shh, don't spoil it!

00:32:39.328 --> 00:32:41.458
MARISHA: 18.

00:32:41.458 --> 00:32:51.265
MATT: No carvings of names or letters, but you do
see a few knots in the tree that have currently

00:32:51.265 --> 00:32:54.349
been carved out and made a home to a number of
woodland creatures.

00:32:54.349 --> 00:32:58.369
LAURA: I've never climbed a tree before.

00:32:58.369 --> 00:32:59.392
MARISHA: Really?

00:32:59.392 --> 00:33:01.216
LAURA: Yeah. This is really pretty.

00:33:01.216 --> 00:33:06.073
MARISHA: What do you think lives in that hole?

00:33:06.073 --> 00:33:09.129
LAURA: Probably very small unicorns.

00:33:09.129 --> 00:33:11.577
MARISHA: Have you ever seen an unicorn?

00:33:11.577 --> 00:33:17.579
LAURA: Yes, I've seen many. The little ones can be
as small as hamsters.

00:33:17.579 --> 00:33:19.908
MARISHA: Pocket unicorns?

00:33:19.908 --> 00:33:21.104
LAURA: Yeah.

00:33:21.104 --> 00:33:23.631
MARISHA: Where do you find such things?

00:33:23.631 --> 00:33:25.878
LAURA: All over. You just have to know where to look.

00:33:25.878 --> 00:33:29.248
SAM: And believe.

00:33:29.248 --> 00:33:31.724
TALIESIN: She's starting to believe.

00:33:31.724 --> 00:33:34.423
MARISHA: What is it like being in your head?

00:33:34.423 --> 00:33:38.834
LAURA: It's pretty great!

00:33:38.834 --> 00:33:45.784
MATT: Eventually, you all gather yourselves again
back at the wagon, cart it back onto the road, and

00:33:45.784 --> 00:33:54.774
head northward. Another few hours pass before the
sun begins to set. As the sky grows darker, the

00:33:54.774 --> 00:34:01.360
clouds from the north-northeast begin to filter in
with a colder wind. You get the sense that the

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:06.833
warm day that you had is coming to a close and who
knows how long the current cold weather will keep.

00:34:06.833 --> 00:34:13.528
The light begins to fade, darker and darker, until
you get the sense that you have about 30 minutes

00:34:13.528 --> 00:34:15.523
before this field goes pitch black.

00:34:15.523 --> 00:34:17.278
LIAM: How cold is it out?

00:34:17.278 --> 00:34:19.213
MATT: You can see your breath.

00:34:19.213 --> 00:34:21.012
LAURA: Oh, that's pretty cold.

00:34:21.012 --> 00:34:26.614
MATT: Not super thick, but when you exhale you see
a bit of the breath before you.

00:34:26.614 --> 00:34:29.694
TRAVIS: Should we pull off on the side of the road
and get a campfire going?

00:34:29.694 --> 00:34:32.562
TALIESIN: I'd say let's get a bit off the road, if
possible.

00:34:32.562 --> 00:34:38.614
MARISHA: Does it look like there's any trees or
any base of mountains or any place that would be a

00:34:38.614 --> 00:34:40.594
good sheltered campsite?

00:34:40.594 --> 00:34:45.304
MATT: There are no mountains anywhere in the
vicinity. You're in the center of the rolling

00:34:45.304 --> 00:34:52.663
hills. There is a cluster of trees you could go to
that's about 300 feet or so off the road. It's

00:34:52.663 --> 00:34:58.021
three trees, so it's not a lot of cover, but
unfortunately you're in the middle of a valley.

00:34:58.021 --> 00:34:59.530
TALIESIN: It'll do.

00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:02.226
LAURA: Can we get the horse over to them?

00:35:02.226 --> 00:35:08.594
MATT: It takes you a little bit. You spend about
45 minutes in pitch dark keeping an eye in that

00:35:08.594 --> 00:35:13.276
direction before you come upon the tree. You can
faintly see the outline of the tree against the

00:35:13.276 --> 00:35:20.570
faint bit of light making it through the cloud cover.
You guys stop there, get the horse a little bit of

00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:23.649
water and feed, and the site's yours.

00:35:23.649 --> 00:35:25.388
TALIESIN: Set a tent. Start a fire.

00:35:25.388 --> 00:35:28.054
LAURA: This is why we should've taken one of the
circus tents.

00:35:28.054 --> 00:35:32.824
TALIESIN: They take an awful lot of time to put
up. You do know this. There's a process.

00:35:32.824 --> 00:35:34.782
LAURA: Yeah, but think about how cool it would be
to camp in one.

00:35:34.782 --> 00:35:40.031
TALIESIN: Oh, it would be amazing. I've done it.
It's great, but this is nice, too.

00:35:40.031 --> 00:35:44.362
TRAVIS: Shall we collect some wood and start a
fire?

00:35:44.362 --> 00:35:46.996
SAM: Sounds good.

00:35:46.996 --> 00:35:48.948
MATT: Who's starting the fire?

00:35:48.948 --> 00:35:53.261
TRAVIS: Anybody want to come with me to find some
kindling?

00:35:53.261 --> 00:35:56.654
MARISHA: I have an adventurer's kit. Does that
have a tinder in it?

00:35:56.654 --> 00:35:59.453
MATT: You can do that.

00:35:59.453 --> 00:36:00.586
TRAVIS: Shall we?

00:36:00.586 --> 00:36:01.671
MARISHA: Sure.

00:36:01.671 --> 00:36:03.355
TRAVIS: All right. Go look for some dead-ish
branches.

00:36:03.355 --> 00:36:07.266
MARISHA: I'm a little-- you be my eyes. It's super
dark.

00:36:07.266 --> 00:36:08.982
SAM: Maybe you shouldn't go.

00:36:08.982 --> 00:36:18.035
MARISHA: You know what, I'll start digging a
little pit.

00:36:18.035 --> 00:36:24.690
LIAM: Now, hold on. I pull a rag out, and I (poof)
one of the Dancing Lights, and make that hooded

00:36:24.690 --> 00:36:26.868
lantern again so that you can see.

00:36:26.868 --> 00:36:32.611
MATT: With that light, it's easy enough to find
some small kindling. There's not a whole lot in

00:36:32.611 --> 00:36:38.358
the vicinity, mainly being that it's an open
field. But you find a few pieces of fallen tree

00:36:38.358 --> 00:36:42.440
and general dead plant life in the vicinity that
can get &lt;i&gt;something&lt;/i&gt; going.

00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:43.904
TALIESIN: We can chop it up.

00:36:43.904 --> 00:36:49.254
MATT: Eventually you get a fire going. It's a
little beacon of light here in the darkness,

00:36:49.254 --> 00:36:56.094
orange-ish flickering against the interior
of the three trees as you guys are situated there.

00:36:56.094 --> 00:37:03.202
You figure you've made it a little under halfway
to Alfield, which is the small city on the way to

00:37:03.202 --> 00:37:09.284
Zadash. It'll take you a little over a day's
travel, or if you push it ahead you could probably

00:37:09.284 --> 00:37:17.739
make it in a day, but you can run the risk of
getting tired. But for resting this evening, who

00:37:17.739 --> 00:37:20.003
wants to take watch?

00:37:20.003 --> 00:37:22.034
TRAVIS: Nobody. We're all going to sleep.

00:37:22.034 --> 00:37:25.671
LIAM: While they decide that, I'm going to pull
out my silver thread and I'm going to start

00:37:25.671 --> 00:37:30.967
winding a 20-foot circle around the fire.

00:37:30.967 --> 00:37:32.483
MARISHA: Oh, nice.

00:37:32.483 --> 00:37:36.384
LAURA: I get my little bouquet of wildflowers and
I give it to Nott.

00:37:36.384 --> 00:37:39.559
SAM: Oh, that's very nice of you.

00:37:39.559 --> 00:37:41.680
LAURA: Well, you said all girls like flowers.

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:47.315
SAM: We do. That's very nice of you, thank you.
What did I do to deserve this?

00:37:47.315 --> 00:37:51.612
LAURA: I don't know, you are my friend.

00:37:51.612 --> 00:37:58.065
TALIESIN: A single tear pours down a porcelain
cheek.

00:37:58.065 --> 00:38:01.332
LAURA: I'll take first watch.

00:38:01.332 --> 00:38:02.707
MATT: Okay.

00:38:02.707 --> 00:38:08.174
LIAM: Everybody hears a little (ting) as I hit a
little bell that I have that's part of it.

00:38:08.174 --> 00:38:10.418
And that's it.

00:38:10.418 --> 00:38:15.029
SAM: I'll sit up with you, Jester, and take first
watch, 1B.

00:38:15.029 --> 00:38:16.852
LAURA: I like it.

00:38:16.852 --> 00:38:23.426
MATT: All right. We'll say for the purposes of
expediency on this, I'll take three perception

00:38:23.426 --> 00:38:29.059
rolls from three different people that are keeping
watch throughout the evening. So with the setup of

00:38:29.059 --> 00:38:31.837
your spell, you go to rest. Jester, you first.

00:38:31.837 --> 00:38:37.309
LAURA: Oh, god damn it!

00:38:37.309 --> 00:38:38.490
SAM: No, it's pretty good.

00:38:38.490 --> 00:38:40.332
LAURA: Yeah, one. So pretty good.

00:38:40.332 --> 00:38:43.605
MATT: All right, natural one. About ten minutes--

00:38:43.605 --> 00:38:44.889
LAURA: Sorry, guys.

00:38:44.889 --> 00:38:49.760
MATT: About ten minutes into your watch, the
inspiration hits for you to start drawing

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:53.696
interesting faces and weird trees. You start
sketching--

00:38:53.696 --> 00:38:56.435
LAURA: Little tiny hamster unicorns!

00:38:56.435 --> 00:39:02.937
MATT: There you go. As you begin to sketch, you
are not paying attention at all to the area around you.

00:39:02.937 --> 00:39:08.854
LAURA: It's really cute! All wrapped up in a
little swaddling blanket!

00:39:08.854 --> 00:39:12.571
MARISHA: Little hamster tails! Oh man!

00:39:12.571 --> 00:39:19.994
MATT: Giant miniatures space unicorns. However,
even though you rolled really poorly, your watch

00:39:19.994 --> 00:39:23.736
goes through unabated. Second watch, who's taking
that?

00:39:23.736 --> 00:39:25.872
LAURA: I'm so tired! (snores)

00:39:25.872 --> 00:39:27.298
LIAM: I will stay up for a little bit, yeah.

00:39:27.298 --> 00:39:29.775
MATT: All right. Go ahead and roll a perception
check, please.

00:39:29.775 --> 00:39:34.190
LAURA, MARISHA, and TRAVIS: (chanting) Caleb!

00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:36.466
LIAM: Oh, that's pretty good. That's a 19.

00:39:36.466 --> 00:39:44.843
MATT: Okay. Keeping an eye out, you see a little
ways off-- it's hard to make out any shapes

00:39:44.843 --> 00:39:50.948
because of your human eyes and, with the firelight
that's near you, your eyes can't adjust to the

00:39:50.948 --> 00:39:55.175
darkness as well, but there are bits and pieces
where the clouds do break, the moonlight comes

00:39:55.175 --> 00:40:02.378
down and you can see a distant shape that's moving
through the field maybe about 400 feet off. You

00:40:02.378 --> 00:40:07.802
can see it pushing through the height of the
grass, moving slowly.

00:40:07.802 --> 00:40:09.396
LIAM: Am I the only one awake at this moment?

00:40:09.396 --> 00:40:10.516
MATT: Yep.

00:40:10.516 --> 00:40:14.248
LIAM: I slowly jiggle Nott awake. (whispers) Get
up.

00:40:14.248 --> 00:40:17.576
SAM: It was violin class! What?

00:40:17.576 --> 00:40:19.898
LIAM: I put a hand over her mouth.

00:40:19.898 --> 00:40:21.513
SAM: What's going on?

00:40:21.513 --> 00:40:27.432
LIAM: There is a thing out around our fire a ways
off.

00:40:27.432 --> 00:40:29.983
SAM: Why did we leave you on watch? You can't see
in the dark!

00:40:29.983 --> 00:40:33.095
LIAM: No, I saw the shape. It's not dark, there's
a fire here.

00:40:33.095 --> 00:40:45.027
SAM: Okay, let me sneak around and look. Right? We
don't want to wake everyone because--

00:40:45.027 --> 00:40:47.973
LIAM: Because we want them to die? I think we
should probably wake everyone.

00:40:47.973 --> 00:40:52.135
SAM: What if it's nothing? Then they'll be upset
with us. There's nothing more dangerous than--

00:40:52.135 --> 00:40:53.401
LIAM: I shake Beau awake.

00:40:53.401 --> 00:40:55.107
SAM: No, she's the most irritable!

00:40:55.107 --> 00:40:56.980
MARISHA: I'm what?

00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:58.093
SAM: Sorry.

00:40:58.093 --> 00:40:59.529
MARISHA: Did you say I'm fucking irritable?

00:40:59.529 --> 00:41:06.611
LIAM: She said "most beautiful." There's a thing
out there in the field. Something is moving.

00:41:06.611 --> 00:41:08.524
LAURA: She can't see! She's human, too!

00:41:08.524 --> 00:41:11.631
(laughter)

00:41:11.631 --> 00:41:13.380
SAM: I'm going to go look! I can see in the dark.

00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:14.793
LIAM: No, wait here!

00:41:14.793 --> 00:41:18.069
SAM: I'm going to dart off in a flanking maneuver.

00:41:18.069 --> 00:41:20.182
MATT: Make a stealth check.

00:41:20.182 --> 00:41:21.703
SAM: 18 plus stuff.

00:41:21.703 --> 00:41:25.633
LIAM: As soon as I see her do that, I start
swatting Fjord on the back to wake him up.

00:41:25.633 --> 00:41:26.957
SAM: 26.

00:41:26.957 --> 00:41:28.236
MARISHA: What do I see?

00:41:28.236 --> 00:41:32.800
MATT: You vaguely see the shape moving, but it's
hard to see, and only because of the moonlight.

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:44.378
Nott, as you stealth up and quickly move through
the grass, eventually you hear this (soft grunting).

00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:50.265
You glance up and see there is not one,
but three large buffalo-type creatures that are

00:41:50.265 --> 00:41:51.995
lumbering through the fields.

00:41:51.995 --> 00:41:53.740
SAM: Buffalo-type creatures, or buffalo?

00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:57.938
MATT: You're not sure. You're not close enough to
see. You see they're bipedal, they're thick and

00:41:57.938 --> 00:42:01.726
muscular, and they have these large horns that
curl off to the side and out.

00:42:01.726 --> 00:42:05.088
TRAVIS: Bipedal?

00:42:05.088 --> 00:42:07.465
MATT: Sorry, quadruped, not bipedal.

00:42:07.465 --> 00:42:09.288
SAM: How far am I from the camp?

00:42:09.288 --> 00:42:18.079
MATT: You're about, maybe, 80 to 100 feet from it.

00:42:18.079 --> 00:42:26.999
SAM: Cool. I'm going to pull out a piece of copper
wire and, remembering the motions that Caleb

00:42:26.999 --> 00:42:32.570
taught me, I'm going to twirl it around in my hand
and hold it up to my mouth and whisper a Message

00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:34.353
just to Caleb.

00:42:34.353 --> 00:42:37.560
TRAVIS: Oh shit, what?!

00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:44.454
SAM: I'm going to say: it's three buffalo, or
buffalo-type objects. Creatures. What do you want

00:42:44.454 --> 00:42:46.623
me to do? (fwoosh)

00:42:46.623 --> 00:42:56.467
LIAM: I'm so proud! I don't know that spell, so I
cannot talk back.

00:42:56.467 --> 00:42:59.336
SAM: Yes, you can!

00:42:59.336 --> 00:43:11.657
LIAM: What? Who said that? If you can can hear
me-- I don't think you can-- come back with the group.

00:43:11.657 --> 00:43:13.601
SAM: All right.

00:43:13.601 --> 00:43:15.176
LAURA: Can you hear him?

00:43:15.176 --> 00:43:16.328
LIAM: Is that how Message works?

00:43:16.328 --> 00:43:17.436
SAM: Yes, I can hear you.

00:43:17.436 --> 00:43:18.719
LAURA: That is awesome!

00:43:18.719 --> 00:43:23.138
MATT: The whispers continue back and forth.

00:43:23.138 --> 00:43:29.407
SAM: It's just one back and forth. I can talk to
him, he can reply once. That's it.

00:43:29.407 --> 00:43:30.697
MATT: For one round.

00:43:30.697 --> 00:43:31.815
LIAM: For one round, so six seconds.

00:43:31.815 --> 00:43:33.150
LAURA: Sick.

00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:35.333
MATT: It's a cantrip.

00:43:35.333 --> 00:43:38.528
LAURA: Oh my gosh, I love it.

00:43:38.528 --> 00:43:40.522
LIAM: Oh, if it's a cantrip, you can do it over
and over again.

00:43:40.522 --> 00:43:42.163
LAURA: It's a cantrip?

00:43:42.163 --> 00:43:47.736
SAM: Is it? Oh, it is! Ooh, this is exciting! I've
never had magic before.

00:43:47.736 --> 00:43:50.149
LIAM: It's two soup cans with a string.

00:43:50.149 --> 00:43:51.690
MATT: Essentially.

00:43:51.690 --> 00:43:53.612
LAURA: How far does it go?

00:43:53.612 --> 00:43:54.787
SAM: You don't know!

00:43:54.787 --> 00:43:56.333
TRAVIS: Yeah, there you go.

00:43:56.333 --> 00:43:57.705
SAM: You're drawing hamsters.

00:43:57.705 --> 00:44:00.019
LAURA: Oh, the cutest unicorn hamsters.

00:44:00.019 --> 00:44:01.576
MATT: So Nott, what are you doing?

00:44:01.576 --> 00:44:07.086
SAM: He said to come back, so I'm coming back. On
the way back, I'm going to see if they're eating

00:44:07.086 --> 00:44:08.816
or sleeping. What are they doing?

00:44:08.816 --> 00:44:12.616
MATT: They're just moving. As you head back to the
camp, you can see they pass and continue heading

00:44:12.616 --> 00:44:17.577
in the southwestern direction in the field, not
taking notice of your fire or the encampment.

00:44:17.577 --> 00:44:20.803
SAM: They could be good for meat. We could go kill
them and eat them for meat.

00:44:20.803 --> 00:44:22.040
LIAM: Is she back?

00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:23.121
MATT: Yes.

00:44:23.121 --> 00:44:27.354
LIAM: I scoop her up. Look at you! You cast a
spell, you spoke to me!

00:44:27.354 --> 00:44:32.052
SAM: You said to do the hand movements and the
whispery thing. And I did it and it worked!

00:44:32.052 --> 00:44:33.597
LIAM: It's as simple as that, isn't it?

00:44:33.597 --> 00:44:34.577
SAM: Yes!

00:44:34.577 --> 00:44:38.160
LIAM: Oh, I'm so proud of you! We need to calm
down and go back to bed.

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:42.017
SAM: Oh, but we could've eaten those buffalo-type
creatures.

00:44:42.017 --> 00:44:44.688
TRAVIS: Hey, what the fuck did you wake us up for,
anyway?

00:44:44.688 --> 00:44:47.771
LIAM: (laughs nervously) Got you.

00:44:47.771 --> 00:44:49.569
TRAVIS: That's a joke?

00:44:49.569 --> 00:44:53.585
LIAM: No. I thought we were all going to die, but
it was just-- what was it?

00:44:53.585 --> 00:44:59.202
SAM: Three large beasts of burden. Wait, we could
use them to pull the cart!

00:44:59.202 --> 00:45:03.823
TRAVIS: Yeah! Where are they?

00:45:03.823 --> 00:45:06.347
SAM: They went that way! In the dark!

00:45:06.347 --> 00:45:12.149
MARISHA: You sure they were just cows? Or donkeys?
Or buffalo-type things?

00:45:12.149 --> 00:45:16.840
SAM: I don't know! I don't know what they were,
but they looked big and able to pull the cart.

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:18.326
TRAVIS: Let's go look at one.

00:45:18.326 --> 00:45:21.260
SAM: You want to go cow-tipping, don't you?

00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:27.457
TRAVIS: Fuck yeah! Take me cow-tipping, son! Woo!

00:45:27.457 --> 00:45:31.548
LIAM: Echoes in the field. (echoing sounds)

00:45:31.548 --> 00:45:33.932
SAM: What happened?

00:45:33.932 --> 00:45:35.799
TRAVIS: I don't know. Back in college.

00:45:35.799 --> 00:45:39.954
SAM: Are we going to go after them or are we going
to go back to sleep?

00:45:39.954 --> 00:45:43.716
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's go look at one.

00:45:43.716 --> 00:45:46.913
LIAM: Well, shit. I guess we're going to look
at a buffalo.

00:45:46.913 --> 00:45:48.255
SAM: Let's go!

00:45:48.255 --> 00:45:51.075
LAURA and TALIESIN: I'm still sleeping.

00:45:51.075 --> 00:45:56.835
MATT: While Molly and Jester continue to enjoy
their continued long rest, you all interrupt it to

00:45:56.835 --> 00:46:02.642
get up, and head in the direction of these
creatures. I would like you all to make a stealth

00:46:02.642 --> 00:46:04.317
check, please.

00:46:04.317 --> 00:46:08.677
SAM: 12.

00:46:08.677 --> 00:46:11.120
TRAVIS and MARISHA: 11.

00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:12.903
LIAM: 16.

00:46:12.903 --> 00:46:23.259
MATT: All right. The four of you, shoulder to
shoulder, keeping low, making your way through the

00:46:23.259 --> 00:46:31.480
field, stepping ever so carefully. And there's
this (croaking) as one of you accidentally goes

00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:38.102
completely foot down on to some sort of field frog
that had been there. As the croak hits, you watch

00:46:38.102 --> 00:46:45.041
as one of the creatures (startled grunting), and
they all start running away, spooked by the sound.

00:46:45.041 --> 00:46:46.459
TRAVIS: Shit.

00:46:46.459 --> 00:46:49.268
MARISHA: Can we tell what they are? Now that we're
closer?

00:46:49.268 --> 00:46:51.518
MATT: Make a perception check, if you want to.

00:46:51.518 --> 00:46:53.230
TRAVIS: I'd like to, with my darkvision.

00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:55.867
MATT: At disadvantage on you, unfortunately, at
this distance.

00:46:55.867 --> 00:46:57.560
TALIESIN: Welcome to human.

00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:01.488
MARISHA: Six.

00:47:01.488 --> 00:47:03.676
MATT: They look like buffalo-like creatures.

00:47:03.676 --> 00:47:05.269
TRAVIS: 13?

00:47:05.269 --> 00:47:07.433
MATT: They look like buffalo.

00:47:07.433 --> 00:47:10.533
SAM: You'll never know what they were.

00:47:10.533 --> 00:47:12.193
TRAVIS: Well, that was worth a look.

00:47:12.193 --> 00:47:17.137
MATT: You aren't too familiar with a lot of the
indigenous animals that live or have been brought

00:47:17.137 --> 00:47:20.568
to this region if they haven't been near the port
towns that you grew up in. You haven't seen these

00:47:20.568 --> 00:47:24.829
types of creatures before, but you vaguely know
they're in the ballpark of what a buffalo, you

00:47:24.829 --> 00:47:26.177
imagine, looks like.

00:47:26.177 --> 00:47:28.627
TRAVIS: It's vaguely what I imagine a buffalo
would look like.

00:47:28.627 --> 00:47:31.779
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:47:31.779 --> 00:47:33.290
SAM: Sorry.

00:47:33.290 --> 00:47:35.535
MARISHA: That was fun, let's go.

00:47:35.535 --> 00:47:37.034
TRAVIS: Back to sleep.

00:47:37.034 --> 00:47:40.775
LIAM: Silently ruffle Nott's hair on the way back
to camp.

00:47:40.775 --> 00:47:42.248
SAM: Stop it.

00:47:42.248 --> 00:47:44.898
LAURA: (singing) Who's got the third watch?

00:47:44.898 --> 00:47:46.139
TALIESIN: I'll take it.

00:47:46.139 --> 00:47:47.495
LIAM: Turd watch.

00:47:47.495 --> 00:47:49.054
MATT: All right. Molly has the third watch.

00:47:49.054 --> 00:47:50.391
TALIESIN: Turd watch.

00:47:50.391 --> 00:47:51.783
MATT: Perception check, please.

00:47:51.783 --> 00:47:52.882
LAURA: Oh no!

00:47:52.882 --> 00:47:54.009
TALIESIN: Six.

00:47:54.009 --> 00:48:01.210
MATT: Okay. As you keep an eye out, everyone else
sleeps throughout the evening. Eventually, you nod

00:48:01.210 --> 00:48:06.823
off, and fall asleep with the rest of them. I
would like to ask all of you to leave the table

00:48:06.823 --> 00:48:10.308
for a moment, except for Fjord.

00:48:10.308 --> 00:48:12.215
TRAVIS: For me?!

00:48:12.215 --> 00:48:13.212
MATT: Yeah.

00:48:13.212 --> 00:48:14.792
MARISHA: It's your turn now!

00:48:14.792 --> 00:48:20.070
TRAVIS: Why? (shouting) Why didn't you roll a
higher perception?

00:48:20.070 --> 00:48:24.136
TALIESIN: I literally don't know. That's actually
the problem.

00:48:24.136 --> 00:48:28.591
MARISHA: Just don't get a lich phylactery
installed in you again.

00:48:28.591 --> 00:48:30.308
TALIESIN: Travis, it's been nice playing with
you.

00:48:30.308 --> 00:48:32.145
TRAVIS: Oh god. Oh no!

00:48:32.145 --> 00:48:34.273
TALIESIN: I thoroughly enjoyed your accent.

00:48:34.273 --> 00:48:39.709
TRAVIS: Oh shit!

00:48:39.709 --> 00:48:51.649
MATT: Fjord, as darkness takes your mind,
dreamless like most, you await the emptiness of

00:48:51.649 --> 00:49:02.358
sleep to carry you to the day. Your sense of body
fades, but your mind and the dark linger. Minutes,

00:49:02.358 --> 00:49:12.806
hours, days. Time loses real sense and meaning,
but you're conscious for it and that is almost

00:49:12.806 --> 00:49:18.727
maddening, in that split second or endless stretch
of experience that you're currently unable to

00:49:18.727 --> 00:49:29.407
express. As the time passes, the air grows colder
around you. The faint shimmer of shifting midnight

00:49:29.407 --> 00:49:38.260
blue, muted and distant, now showing endless depth
before you, rippling. You begin to flail about,

00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:43.689
your senses returning with the dropping
temperature, but there is resistance to your limbs

00:49:43.689 --> 00:49:53.892
as you push in the space around you. You're
sluggish. There's force. It's not air, it's water.

00:49:53.892 --> 00:50:01.325
You suddenly feel the burning pain in your lungs
as your breath fights to escape you, but you hold

00:50:01.325 --> 00:50:07.006
tight. You seize and swim in desperation, choosing
any direction, but the shimmering blue is

00:50:07.006 --> 00:50:17.805
directionless. There is no up, there is no down.
It's just depth. Movement. The universal shadows

00:50:17.805 --> 00:50:25.617
dance as one, right to left. With a speed that
pulls you along with the current, you feel

00:50:25.617 --> 00:50:31.978
yourself being jostled. As it shifts again to the
left to right, around behind you, you find

00:50:31.978 --> 00:50:37.230
yourself toppling, head over end, eventually
coming to rest again. You spiral over and over

00:50:37.230 --> 00:50:42.522
again, the darkness swallowing you, tightening
around you as this dance, this shape, this endless

00:50:42.522 --> 00:50:51.147
coil, this spiral around you. As the current tugs
at you, battering you, you cannot fight any more

00:50:51.147 --> 00:50:56.609
as the increased power of the current pulls on
your form. You cough, and the freezing waters rush

00:50:56.609 --> 00:51:04.921
into your body, the briny taste of salt water
stinging your insides. Your wincing eyes open with

00:51:04.921 --> 00:51:15.349
the pain that clutches the interior of your chest,
only to see a gargantuan mass moving through the

00:51:15.349 --> 00:51:24.816
water around you, like a massive noose closing in.
The pain in your chest vanishes. As your breathing

00:51:24.898 --> 00:51:34.400
normalizes-- thicker than air, but breathable all
the same-- it feels strange yet weirdly familiar.

00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:45.997
In that moment, yellow light bursts before you in
the shape of an enormous yellow eye. An

00:51:45.997 --> 00:51:52.008
impossibly low tone rumbles through the waters
around you, shaking you to your core, like an

00:51:52.008 --> 00:52:04.219
organic war horn the size of a canyon. The eye
narrows as the tone grows stronger. A thought

00:52:04.219 --> 00:52:09.357
enters your mind, a jumble of emotions that your
brain attempts to make sense of until a word

00:52:09.357 --> 00:52:31.102
congeals into the center of your consciousness:
"Watching." The eye just looks at you, waiting expectantly.

00:52:31.102 --> 00:52:36.517
TRAVIS: (English accent) What are you?

00:52:36.517 --> 00:52:38.857
MATT: "Watching."

00:52:38.857 --> 00:52:43.861
TRAVIS: Watching me?

00:52:43.861 --> 00:52:53.279
MATT: The eye opens a bit and leans closer towards
you. "Potential."

00:52:53.279 --> 00:53:10.399
TRAVIS: My potential? What are you asking of me?

00:53:10.399 --> 00:53:14.461
MATT: "Learn."

00:53:14.461 --> 00:53:20.280
TRAVIS: Learn. What would you have me learn?

00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:33.381
MATT: "Learn. Grow. Provoke. Consume."

00:53:33.381 --> 00:53:42.676
TRAVIS: Learn, grow, provoke, consume. I don't
understand.

00:53:42.676 --> 00:53:46.394
MATT: "Reward."

00:53:46.394 --> 00:53:55.824
TRAVIS: A reward for this? I'm listening.

00:53:55.824 --> 00:54:06.988
MATT: "Patience." The eye closes, and the light is
gone. You feel the darkness and the cold

00:54:06.988 --> 00:54:11.843
completely suffuse your entire world as the panic
and solitude, the true quiet of your

00:54:11.843 --> 00:54:17.755
unconsciousness, begins to take hold. At that
moment, you gasp for breath, and your eyes open,

00:54:17.755 --> 00:54:22.969
coughing and sputtering in the morning air. If we
could have everybody else come back to the table,

00:54:22.969 --> 00:54:26.555
please! Call them back in.

00:54:26.555 --> 00:54:38.398
TRAVIS: Fuck. Fuck you! What were those words?!

00:54:38.398 --> 00:54:52.753
MATT: Watching, potential, learn, grow, provoke,
consume. We'll go over the rest later. Come on in!

00:54:52.753 --> 00:54:54.005
SAM: Are we supposed to come back?

00:54:54.005 --> 00:54:55.170
MATT: Yes, you're supposed to come back in.

00:54:55.170 --> 00:54:56.220
LAURA: We're supposed to come in!

00:54:56.220 --> 00:54:57.098
MATT: You are.

00:54:57.098 --> 00:54:59.336
TRAVIS: Sorry, I found a patch of strawberries.

00:54:59.336 --> 00:55:00.711
TALIESIN: Everybody back?

00:55:00.711 --> 00:55:01.915
MATT: Everybody back.

00:55:01.915 --> 00:55:06.266
LIAM: Are you okay? We're fine? Everything's
good?

00:55:06.266 --> 00:55:09.427
TRAVIS: Yeah! We're fine. We're great. Just
doing dandy. Yep.

00:55:09.427 --> 00:55:11.177
LIAM: You would tell us if something was wrong?

00:55:11.177 --> 00:55:13.274
TRAVIS: Of course.

00:55:13.274 --> 00:55:20.023
SAM: That was fast. You really fought five guys in
an alleyway that fast?

00:55:20.023 --> 00:55:22.950
TRAVIS: Sometimes it doesn't take that long, you
know what I mean?

00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:25.224
LAURA: What does he look like? What are we doing?

00:55:25.224 --> 00:55:34.958
MATT: As the rest of you have already come to
consciousness in the morning air, begun to situate

00:55:34.958 --> 00:55:42.165
your belongings and put out the embers of the fire
that lasted-- pardon-- throughout the night. Your

00:55:42.165 --> 00:55:51.113
morning belches getting out. Fjord has slept in,
and has been ever so still in his sleep. Suddenly,

00:55:51.113 --> 00:55:59.105
without warning, he suddenly shoots up from his
sleep, his eyes wide, and as he opens his mouth,

00:55:59.105 --> 00:56:02.639
begins coughing and spitting water up.

00:56:02.639 --> 00:56:06.285
TRAVIS: (coughing)

00:56:06.285 --> 00:56:09.741
SAM: Oh no, he's injured!

00:56:09.741 --> 00:56:15.301
LAURA: Fjord! Have I ever seen this happen to him
before?

00:56:15.301 --> 00:56:16.642
MATT: No.

00:56:16.642 --> 00:56:18.422
LIAM: Can you speak?

00:56:18.422 --> 00:56:21.166
TRAVIS: Yeah. No, I'm fine.

00:56:21.166 --> 00:56:23.006
TALIESIN: Yeah, you look it.

00:56:23.006 --> 00:56:28.571
LIAM: You just spit a lot of water out and you
were sleeping.

00:56:28.571 --> 00:56:31.192
TALIESIN: Was it a lot of water?

00:56:31.192 --> 00:56:37.234
MATT: It was a sizeable glass filled with water.

00:56:37.234 --> 00:56:42.422
TALIESIN: I'm going to do something very weird.
I'm going to walk over and dampen my hand on the

00:56:42.422 --> 00:56:47.569
water on his chest really quickly and (sniffing).

00:56:47.569 --> 00:56:51.674
MATT: It's briny and salty.

00:56:51.674 --> 00:56:53.098
TALIESIN: Huh.

00:56:53.098 --> 00:56:55.317
SAM: Why are you drinking salt water?

00:56:55.317 --> 00:56:56.473
TALIESIN: You don't know that.

00:56:56.473 --> 00:56:59.173
SAM: Oh. (in Sam's voice) Why are you drinking 
salt water?

00:56:59.173 --> 00:57:02.631
(laughter)

00:57:02.705 --> 00:57:05.724
LAURA: Jeez, Fjord. That's a lot of drool.

00:57:05.724 --> 00:57:09.962
MARISHA: Does it taste like stomach acid? Because
that's gross, man.

00:57:09.962 --> 00:57:13.333
TALIESIN: Only one way to find out!

00:57:13.333 --> 00:57:19.443
TRAVIS: Like a momma bird. Everybody have some of
what I puked up. It's all good.

00:57:19.443 --> 00:57:22.873
LIAM: I don't, I want to make an insight check. 
He's talking about acid reflux but he just spit a

00:57:22.873 --> 00:57:24.311
bunch of water out.

00:57:24.311 --> 00:57:25.687
MATT: Yeah, make an insight check.

00:57:25.687 --> 00:57:30.116
LIAM: Yeah, okay. That's 22.

00:57:30.116 --> 00:57:32.935
TRAVIS: Yeah, I don't think it was acid reflux.

00:57:32.935 --> 00:57:34.343
MARISHA: You taste like a seaman.

00:57:34.343 --> 00:57:39.164
(laughter)

00:57:39.164 --> 00:57:48.266
TRAVIS: I don't know. I want to shake your hand,
but at the same time, I want to smash it.

00:57:48.266 --> 00:57:52.633
MATT: I've never been more proud of my wife.

00:57:52.633 --> 00:57:57.329
TAIESIN: That's not normal.

00:57:57.329 --> 00:58:00.455
LAURA: What happened, Fjord?

00:58:00.455 --> 00:58:02.516
LIAM: Does he seem full of shit to me?

00:58:02.516 --> 00:58:10.535
MATT: Seems like he's covering some confusion or
at least trying to deflect.

00:58:10.535 --> 00:58:19.932
TRAVIS: I had a dream, I'm sorry. A vivid one.
Just shook me to my core a little. I'll be fine,

00:58:19.932 --> 00:58:22.251
really. It's not a common thing.

00:58:22.251 --> 00:58:25.153
LAURA: Why the water, though?

00:58:25.153 --> 00:58:30.851
TRAVIS: I don't know.

00:58:30.851 --> 00:58:38.704
MARISHA: You never told me where you got that
sword. I mean, because I saw it get a little soggy,

00:58:38.704 --> 00:58:42.765
a little drippy, when we were fighting the frog
thing, so, you know.

00:58:42.765 --> 00:58:51.094
MATT: As you glance down at your sheath on the
ground, it is empty. There is no falchion.

00:58:51.094 --> 00:59:00.689
TRAVIS: Yeah. That sword is a pickle.

00:59:00.689 --> 00:59:05.758
MARISHA: It's a pickled sword? Are there benefits
to pickling your weapons?

00:59:05.758 --> 00:59:07.556
TRAVIS: It's a mystery.

00:59:07.556 --> 00:59:08.984
MARISHA: Oh, right.

00:59:08.984 --> 00:59:12.291
TALIESIN: He's not wrong, though. It actually is a
pickle. You can taste it.

00:59:12.291 --> 00:59:14.415
MARISHA: Yeah. It is very salty.

00:59:14.415 --> 00:59:15.970
LAURA: I do like pickles.

00:59:15.970 --> 00:59:17.368
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's not bad.

00:59:17.368 --> 00:59:20.138
LIAM: Is our group going to be all about puns and
that stuff?

00:59:20.138 --> 00:59:23.321
SAM: It's the lowest form of humor.

00:59:23.321 --> 00:59:26.506
LAURA: Is it really the lowest?

00:59:26.506 --> 00:59:28.998
TALIESIN: Level three.

00:59:28.998 --> 00:59:33.522
MARISHA: Okay, there are some pun competitions
that get serious.

00:59:33.522 --> 00:59:37.110
SAM: Are you all right, Fjord?

00:59:37.110 --> 00:59:50.227
TRAVIS: Yeah. I feel funny. Caleb, you remember me
asking you about your arcane prowess?

00:59:50.227 --> 00:59:52.056
LIAM: Yeah.

00:59:52.056 --> 01:00:00.864
TRAVIS: My small experience with the arcane came
to me around the same time that sword did.

01:00:00.864 --> 01:00:03.787
LIAM: How long ago was that?

01:00:03.787 --> 01:00:09.305
TRAVIS: Not too long ago. Very recent. Right
before I met up with Jester.

01:00:09.305 --> 01:00:12.830
SAM: Were you in the ocean?

01:00:12.830 --> 01:00:26.907
TRAVIS: Yeah, I was. Did a lot of merchant
sailing, previously. Had one trip that didn't go

01:00:26.907 --> 01:00:36.179
so well. Suffice it to say, after it was done, I
found that sword.

01:00:36.179 --> 01:00:41.369
MARISHA: What happened on the trip? Rough waters?

01:00:41.369 --> 01:00:44.994
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:00:44.994 --> 01:00:47.683
SAM: Did anyone die?

01:00:47.683 --> 01:00:52.533
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm not real comfortable talking
about it.

01:00:52.533 --> 01:00:57.048
LIAM: What about the sword? You said you found it
on the ocean, you found on the boat you were on?

01:00:57.048 --> 01:00:59.655
You were on an island? What do you mean?

01:00:59.655 --> 01:01:08.984
TRAVIS: I found it on the shore. When I got back
to land, it was just there. I'm not super familiar

01:01:08.984 --> 01:01:16.872
with a ton of weaponry-- the sword I know, I had
some training in it, but this seemed like a unique

01:01:16.872 --> 01:01:26.698
sword. I felt like it almost called to me. I know
how that sounds, but when I picked it up, seemed

01:01:26.698 --> 01:01:33.057
like everything changed. Ever since, I've been
able to do more things. Been able to reach out

01:01:33.057 --> 01:01:40.349
with some of the stuff I've seen you do. That's
why I'm trying to make it up to the Academy. I'm

01:01:40.349 --> 01:01:43.510
trying to figure out what it is that I have.

01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:51.937
LIAM: DM, when I cast Detect Magic in the first
game, in the tavern, did that sword light up?

01:01:51.937 --> 01:01:55.187
MATT: No.

01:01:55.187 --> 01:02:02.264
TRAVIS: I don't mean to alarm any of you, really.
I'm trying to be as forthright as I can.

01:02:02.264 --> 01:02:04.852
TALIESIN: Where is the sword right now?

01:02:04.852 --> 01:02:10.401
TRAVIS: Can I make it appear?

01:02:10.401 --> 01:02:16.645
MATT: You look down, and it's not in the sheath.
You glance around, it's nowhere near you.

01:02:16.645 --> 01:02:22.641
TRAVIS: I focus. Reach down.

01:02:22.641 --> 01:02:30.868
MATT: He looks down at his open palm, and there is
a flash of greenish-blue, teal energy out of his

01:02:30.868 --> 01:02:41.606
grip. There, clutched within his grasp, you see
the falchion, coated in the remnants of sea floor

01:02:41.606 --> 01:02:46.658
life. You see the barnacles encrusted around the
edge and up the back of the blade, as it begins to

01:02:46.658 --> 01:02:51.159
drip water. The same kind that was coughed up by
Fjord this morning.

01:02:51.159 --> 01:02:59.128
TRAVIS: You can see why I'm a little curious about
this item.

01:02:59.128 --> 01:03:01.149
TALIESIN: That's a great trick.

01:03:01.149 --> 01:03:06.373
LIAM: I don't even need to touch it, but would you
trust me to study it for a moment?

01:03:06.373 --> 01:03:14.313
TRAVIS: Do you have any experience with items like
this?

01:03:14.313 --> 01:03:19.520
LIAM: I'm good at figuring things out. I'm
clever.

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:28.074
MARISHA: I might be able help you with that. I was
obsessed with underwater life and mermaids, so

01:03:28.074 --> 01:03:29.703
I've read a few books.

01:03:29.703 --> 01:03:36.043
TRAVIS: Could we revisit that idea, perhaps? I'm
sorry, the night has left me a bit shaken, and I

01:03:36.043 --> 01:03:41.723
feel like I need a moment to get my bearings, if
that's all right.

01:03:41.723 --> 01:03:47.460
LIAM: Ja, you can understand that we would be
curious, but I don't want to push anybody. I mean,

01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:48.753
we've just met.

01:03:48.753 --> 01:03:53.265
TRAVIS: Of course not, and I don't want to make anyone
feel uneasy. Again, trying to be as transparent as

01:03:53.265 --> 01:04:04.586
I can. I don't quite understand, and I appreciate
your patience in advance. And I make it vanish.

01:04:04.586 --> 01:04:07.565
MATT: You watch as it just disappears out of your
grip.

01:04:07.565 --> 01:04:11.710
LIAM: When he says he doesn't quite understand, is
he telling the truth? Is that the same insight check?

01:04:11.710 --> 01:04:13.957
MATT: You have to make a new one.

01:04:13.957 --> 01:04:19.622
LIAM: 11.

01:04:19.622 --> 01:04:21.099
TALIESIN: 23.

01:04:21.099 --> 01:04:22.594
MATT: 23.

01:04:22.594 --> 01:04:27.959
TALIESIN: This whole story, I've been watching.

01:04:27.959 --> 01:04:33.329
MATT: As far as you can tell, as forthright and
honest as you've heard him be.

01:04:33.329 --> 01:04:35.964
TALIESIN: That's so disappointing. All right.

01:04:35.964 --> 01:04:41.943
LAURA: Fjord, do you think you're slowly turning
into water?

01:04:41.943 --> 01:04:53.798
TRAVIS: (sighs) No. I hadn't considered that
terrifying thought, but thanks. I'll just add that

01:04:53.798 --> 01:04:55.983
to the fucking list.

01:04:55.983 --> 01:05:00.728
LAURA: If you feel like it's happening, let us
know and we'll try to catch you in a jar.

01:05:00.728 --> 01:05:02.731
TRAVIS: In a jar?

01:05:02.731 --> 01:05:05.077
TALIESIN: Unless he runs away.

01:05:05.077 --> 01:05:07.396
SAM: We're not going to let you run into the
dirt.

01:05:07.396 --> 01:05:09.840
LAURA: Maybe something can happen.

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:14.906
TRAVIS: Tell you what, I start sweating real hard,
I'll let you know, okay?

01:05:14.906 --> 01:05:16.479
TALIESIN: He's fine.

01:05:16.479 --> 01:05:26.081
MARISHA: Has that happened to you before, by the
way? The whole, "waking up coughing salt water" thing?

01:05:26.081 --> 01:05:31.937
TRAVIS: I don't really remember.

01:05:31.937 --> 01:05:36.594
LIAM: You wouldn't have to remember that far back.
You said that this all started just a few weeks

01:05:36.594 --> 01:05:38.429
ago, when you met this one.

01:05:38.429 --> 01:05:44.595
TRAVIS: I don't really remember my dreams all that
well. They leave me quickly.

01:05:44.595 --> 01:05:48.816
TALIESIN: I remember all of mine, I don't know.

01:05:48.816 --> 01:05:51.760
LAURA: I've never seen him wake up with water all
over him.

01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:58.983
MARISHA: Well, excited to see what unfolds. Shall
we?

01:05:58.983 --> 01:06:02.422
TALIESIN: If you're going to vomit something, salt
water's pretty decent. It could have been way worse.

01:06:02.422 --> 01:06:04.527
LAURA: Of all things, it's way better than vomit.

01:06:04.527 --> 01:06:08.847
TALIESIN: Oh, it's far superior. Already, you're
proving to be an asset.

01:06:08.847 --> 01:06:14.984
LAURA: If we get really thirsty, we'll just come
to you in the morning.

01:06:14.984 --> 01:06:19.058
TALIESIN: You can't drink-- the salt water makes
you thirstier.

01:06:19.058 --> 01:06:20.317
LAURA: Oh, really?

01:06:20.317 --> 01:06:22.945
TALIESIN: It feels like you should be able to, but
you can't.

01:06:22.945 --> 01:06:26.397
SAM: Should we get back on the road, then?

01:06:26.397 --> 01:06:28.032
TRAVIS: If you wouldn't mind.

01:06:28.032 --> 01:06:32.613
SAM: How is Horse doing today?

01:06:32.613 --> 01:06:34.370
TRAVIS: Horse?

01:06:34.370 --> 01:06:35.508
SAM: How's Horse?

01:06:35.508 --> 01:06:36.570
LAURA: What is his name?

01:06:36.570 --> 01:06:42.024
LIAM: I was wondering the very same thing,
actually, all night. I was wondering what we would call--

01:06:42.024 --> 01:06:46.083
LAURA: This horse? Maybe he has a name. Molly?

01:06:46.083 --> 01:06:50.602
TALIESIN: Does the horse have a name? If it did,
I'll make one up.

01:06:50.602 --> 01:06:54.288
MATT: It probably had a few names, in travel, and
you've gone through a few horses.

01:06:54.288 --> 01:06:58.031
TALIESIN: Try not to name them. We're just going
to end up eating them.

01:06:58.031 --> 01:07:01.264
MATT: So whatever you come up with.

01:07:01.264 --> 01:07:05.188
TALIESIN: His name was Winter's Crest. If he lived
that long, that was when we were going to butcher

01:07:05.188 --> 01:07:09.628
him and eat him. You can rename him, it's fine.

01:07:09.628 --> 01:07:11.795
LAURA: I like it, it's like a celebration.

01:07:11.795 --> 01:07:13.203
TALIESIN: That was the plan.

01:07:13.203 --> 01:07:16.335
SAM: Maybe for short we'll call him W.C.

01:07:16.335 --> 01:07:25.739
LIAM: You were going to butcher, at Winter's
Crest, and that's a special treat?

01:07:25.739 --> 01:07:30.871
TALIESIN: It means you're going to eat meat, and
then you're going to make some jerky, and then

01:07:30.871 --> 01:07:33.334
you're going to buy another horse with the money
you make.

01:07:33.334 --> 01:07:40.665
MATT: Interesting point, too: For most of you,
Winter's Crest would have little meaning. It's

01:07:40.665 --> 01:07:46.021
largely celebrated in continents to the west, as
it is specific to a historic event that did not

01:07:46.021 --> 01:07:51.383
happen in Wildemount. But you're a carnival, so
you guys have more of a vast and strange knowledge.

01:07:51.383 --> 01:07:52.778
TALIESIN: We celebrate everything.

01:07:52.778 --> 01:07:55.623
MATT: When he says Winter's Crest, maybe Beau.

01:07:55.623 --> 01:07:57.180
LIAM: Have I ever read about it?

01:07:57.180 --> 01:07:59.944
LAURA: I feel like my mom saw lots of visitors
from other places.

01:07:59.944 --> 01:08:04.578
MATT: It's possible, but just for a bit of
information.

01:08:04.578 --> 01:08:09.920
MARISHA: I feel like the snooty town that I came
from would have a Winter's Crest festival, like

01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:18.830
how we have Oktoberfests out here. Even though we
have no real business having them, yeah.

01:08:18.830 --> 01:08:21.049
TALIESIN: Just glögg. Lots and lots of glögg.

01:08:21.049 --> 01:08:26.839
MATT: As you guys look off, at this conversation
with the horse, the horse is currently about 30

01:08:26.839 --> 01:08:30.354
feet off in the field, eating grass out of the
field.

01:08:30.354 --> 01:08:35.209
TALIESIN: If you're on the road long enough, you
eat a lot of animals. You eat a lot of beasts of burden.

01:08:35.209 --> 01:08:43.296
LAURA: I wander over to the wagon and I go and sit
down and start drawing, because I need to. I need

01:08:43.296 --> 01:08:45.390
to spend a little time.

01:08:45.390 --> 01:08:51.690
LIAM: I pull Nott over. Do you know what W.C.
means in Zemnian?

01:08:51.690 --> 01:08:53.570
SAM: What does it mean?

01:08:53.570 --> 01:08:54.967
LIAM: Toilet.

01:08:54.967 --> 01:08:57.278
SAM: It's a pun.

01:08:57.278 --> 01:09:00.867
(laughter)

01:09:00.867 --> 01:09:03.256
LIAM: I give her a little fistbump.

01:09:03.256 --> 01:09:09.828
MATT: As you guys gather up, in the fresh morning
air, back into the cart.

01:09:09.828 --> 01:09:11.789
MARISHA: Do some pull-ups on the tree branches.

01:09:11.789 --> 01:09:13.972
MATT: As Beau gets nice and swole for the
morning.

01:09:13.972 --> 01:09:16.171
LIAM: Vasquez.

01:09:16.171 --> 01:09:17.617
MARISHA: Just a little bit.

01:09:17.617 --> 01:09:19.112
TRAVIS: You're just too bad, Vasquez.

01:09:19.112 --> 01:09:29.183
MATT: (laughter) Vasquez is a pretty good print.
I think we were talking, Vasquez and Starbuck

01:09:29.183 --> 01:09:37.884
from the new Battlestar are both good character
prints for Beau. Yeah, love that. As you guys

01:09:37.884 --> 01:09:44.883
bring the cart back up onto the Amber Road,
northward, you begin your second-day trek. You

01:09:44.883 --> 01:09:53.230
guys push on for a few hours. Is it still Beau and
Mollymauk keeping point?

01:09:53.230 --> 01:09:54.137
TALIESIN: I'll keep.

01:09:54.137 --> 01:09:55.191
MARISHA: I don't mind.

01:09:55.191 --> 01:09:56.953
MATT: I'll have both of you roll a perception
check, please.

01:09:56.953 --> 01:10:01.047
MARISHA: Do we have the highest perception?

01:10:01.047 --> 01:10:03.100
TALIESIN: Ugh. I did until it bounced.

01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:07.271
MARISHA: Fuck. I almost got-- samesies. 11.

01:10:07.271 --> 01:10:08.387
TALIESIN: Five.

01:10:08.387 --> 01:10:09.541
MATT: Okay.

01:10:09.541 --> 01:10:11.567
LAURA: I have decent perception, what's yours?

01:10:11.567 --> 01:10:12.995
MATT: Calm fields.

01:10:12.995 --> 01:10:18.631
TALIESIN: I might be distracted looking for things
that I can pluck out of the fields. All right.

01:10:18.631 --> 01:10:24.996
MATT: You push on for a few more hours, the
afternoon staring to get late. You can choose

01:10:24.996 --> 01:10:30.781
soon, when it gets dark, to set up camp again and
stay another evening out in the fields, or you get

01:10:30.781 --> 01:10:36.018
a sense looking at the map that you had procured
that if you push an extra hour or so past, you

01:10:36.018 --> 01:10:39.750
could probably make it to Alfield before the
night's done.

01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:41.421
SAM: Let's do that.

01:10:41.421 --> 01:10:43.065
TALIESIN: Most of us can see in the dark, it's not
a big deal.

01:10:43.065 --> 01:10:44.333
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:10:44.333 --> 01:10:47.369
LAURA: Okay. You guys just hunker down in the
wagon, okay? You be safe.

01:10:47.369 --> 01:10:48.571
MARISHA: Deal.

01:10:48.571 --> 01:10:50.105
LIAM: Must be nice.

01:10:50.105 --> 01:10:52.623
TRAVIS, LIAM, and TALIESIN: (singing) Must be
nice.

01:10:52.623 --> 01:10:54.441
TALIESIN: Can't say that, ah!

01:10:54.441 --> 01:11:02.297
MATT: All righty. You guys push forward, kind of
pick up the pace a bit, but the horse and those of

01:11:02.297 --> 01:11:06.730
you who are on the sides of the cart, if you wish
to, you can jog along the side to alleviate some

01:11:06.730 --> 01:11:07.602
of the burden.

01:11:07.602 --> 01:11:09.017
MARISHA: I'm going to scan still while I'm--

01:11:09.017 --> 01:11:10.176
MATT: Keeping an eye out.

01:11:10.176 --> 01:11:11.485
MARISHA: With my shitty vision.

01:11:11.485 --> 01:11:20.091
MATT: Okay. The sun does eventually close towards
the Cyrios Mountains to the west and night begins

01:11:20.091 --> 01:11:27.063
to fall. At this point, you do see just over the
distance in the hill as darkness comes, you can

01:11:27.063 --> 01:11:35.016
see the faint glow, a cluster of light, of a
village in the distant hills. You get the sense

01:11:35.016 --> 01:11:42.232
that this is probably Alfield at the perimeter of
your vision. As you continue to push forward,

01:11:42.232 --> 01:11:47.949
you've now gone past eight hours of continuous
travel into the ninth hour. I would like you all

01:11:47.949 --> 01:11:51.712
to roll a constitution saving throw, please.

01:11:51.712 --> 01:11:56.841
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Natural 20.

01:11:56.841 --> 01:12:00.935
LAURA: Whoa. That's because you guys are-- oh, no,
you're riding in the cart.

01:12:00.935 --> 01:12:02.087
MARISHA: I'm riding.

01:12:02.087 --> 01:12:03.192
TRAVIS: 16.

01:12:03.192 --> 01:12:04.595
MARISHA: I'm just like: What's wrong?

01:12:04.595 --> 01:12:07.967
LIAM, SAM, and LAURA: Nine.

01:12:07.967 --> 01:12:13.213
MATT: Nine as well? Wow. It's like Rammstein on
that side of the table.

01:12:13.213 --> 01:12:16.331
(laughter)

01:12:16.331 --> 01:12:18.639
TRAVIS: Nein! Cookie monster.

01:12:18.639 --> 01:12:21.114
MATT: All right. So the three of you take one
level of exhaustion.

01:12:21.114 --> 01:12:24.326
LAURA: Aw. How do we do that in here?

01:12:24.326 --> 01:12:25.993
LIAM: How does that affect us, again?

01:12:25.993 --> 01:12:30.671
MATT: This is a good thing to look up.
Essentially, per point of exhaustion--

01:12:30.671 --> 01:12:32.510
TALIESIN: So you go to your HP.

01:12:32.510 --> 01:12:38.692
MATT: There you go. So you have disadvantage on
ability checks until you take a long rest to get

01:12:38.692 --> 01:12:40.036
rid of it.

01:12:40.036 --> 01:12:41.260
LAURA: Disadvantage on abilities?

01:12:41.260 --> 01:12:43.241
MATT: Yes. On ability checks, so skills and things
like that.

01:12:43.241 --> 01:12:45.293
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

01:12:45.293 --> 01:12:51.981
MATT: All right. You guys are-- you're a few--
you're probably about a half mile away from

01:12:51.981 --> 01:12:59.928
Alfield and it looks, even at this distance, a bit
smaller than Trostenwald, where you were. You can

01:12:59.928 --> 01:13:05.147
see the faint clusters of trees on the north,
eastern and northeastern sides of the city,

01:13:05.147 --> 01:13:12.310
otherwise it's just in this pocket behind a few
hills. It's a bit podunk in size, you can gather

01:13:12.310 --> 01:13:22.192
from this distance, but it's welcoming. There's a
flash of orange light on the outskirts of town.

01:13:22.192 --> 01:13:24.730
LIAM: Did that look arcane to me?

01:13:24.730 --> 01:13:30.083
MATT: No, it just looked like a flash. I mean, it
could have been arcane. It's hard to tell at this

01:13:30.083 --> 01:13:31.595
distance, it's quite a ways away.

01:13:31.595 --> 01:13:33.051
TALIESIN: That's weird.

01:13:33.051 --> 01:13:40.779
MATT: There's a second one. (flash) You faintly
see what looks like the distant curl of flames

01:13:40.779 --> 01:13:43.405
beginning to spread across what appears to be a
roof.

01:13:43.405 --> 01:13:44.690
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

01:13:44.690 --> 01:13:45.768
LAURA: Oh no.

01:13:45.768 --> 01:13:49.210
MARISHA: Think we just watched someone commit
arson, you guys!

01:13:49.210 --> 01:13:50.916
TRAVIS: That's not really a--

01:13:50.916 --> 01:13:52.320
MARISHA: Let's go kick their ass.

01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:53.542
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's do that.

01:13:53.542 --> 01:13:55.390
LAURA: Does it look like the fire is spreading at
all?

01:13:55.390 --> 01:13:56.839
MATT: I mean, as you sit here and watch--

01:13:56.839 --> 01:13:58.026
LAURA: We're walking.

01:13:58.026 --> 01:14:00.464
TALIESIN: Let's head that direction and start
yelling at people.

01:14:00.464 --> 01:14:01.746
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Full sprint.

01:14:01.746 --> 01:14:03.028
TRAVIS: Fire!

01:14:03.028 --> 01:14:08.529
MATT: You guys begin to go into a faster jog in
that direction. As you do, you can see the fire is

01:14:08.529 --> 01:14:14.263
now beginning to consume a handful of buildings
and the flames are beginning to flicker higher.

01:14:14.263 --> 01:14:23.515
You begin to hear in the distance a very faint
high-pitched yelp or some sort of a screech. It's

01:14:23.515 --> 01:14:27.632
hard to make it out at this distance, it's an open
field area and it's mingling with what sounds like

01:14:27.632 --> 01:14:36.694
now dozens of voices screaming and entwining. As
you can see the uncontrolled flames still

01:14:36.694 --> 01:14:42.742
progressing on the eastern side of the village,
you can just see, as you get within a few hundred

01:14:42.742 --> 01:14:49.946
feet of the western side of Alfield, people just
running. Villagers, probably a few hundred of

01:14:49.946 --> 01:14:56.288
them, are now just running out of the town as you
guys begin to approach. Towards you and out into

01:14:56.288 --> 01:14:58.863
the field. So as you're approaching, they're
coming your direction.

01:14:58.863 --> 01:15:01.073
TALIESIN: I'm going to stop one and ask what
happened.

01:15:01.073 --> 01:15:08.343
MATT: As you glance over, you see a family of five
halflings rushing right past you. The mother is

01:15:08.343 --> 01:15:12.304
dragging two of the younger ones by the hand while
the father is running alongside the eldest

01:15:12.304 --> 01:15:17.220
daughter, probably in her teens. The father wears
a leather cap and has a handlebar mustache and

01:15:17.220 --> 01:15:21.086
simple farm clothing. As you shout out, he makes
your eye contact.

01:15:21.086 --> 01:15:22.710
TALIESIN: What has happened?

01:15:22.710 --> 01:15:26.854
MATT: "Oh, I don't know what happened. They
started to burn the buildings and these things

01:15:26.854 --> 01:15:29.897
"started rushing. The city is under attack."

01:15:29.897 --> 01:15:31.358
LAURA: What things?

01:15:31.358 --> 01:15:37.850
MATT: (panicked) "Big things. Dog-faced. I can't--
Come on." They just keep running.

01:15:37.850 --> 01:15:40.193
LAURA: Dogs are attacking the village!

01:15:40.193 --> 01:15:45.134
MATT: At this point, you guys can see more people
are fleeing. As you get closer, about 100 feet

01:15:45.134 --> 01:15:51.227
outside the city, you watch as the droves of
people are beginning to get-- at least either the

01:15:51.227 --> 01:15:54.470
ones that are actively fleeing have made it out of
the city, or in the process the stragglers are still

01:15:54.470 --> 01:16:02.300
coming through. You see a young human man with
scrappy, tattered brown hair, a bit of blood

01:16:02.300 --> 01:16:07.676
dripping down his face, running before his back
arches and he falls into the grass. You can see an

01:16:07.676 --> 01:16:13.021
arrow protruding from his back. At that point, you
can see, standing up from behind one of the

01:16:13.021 --> 01:16:19.846
exterior walls of the city, a humanoid creature
stretching up to about seven feet tall, muscular

01:16:19.846 --> 01:16:26.356
torso with thin dog-like legs. You watch as it
extends its neck with spots of fur, its ears

01:16:26.356 --> 01:16:30.511
curled upwards as it has a dog-like snout at the
front of it.

01:16:30.511 --> 01:16:32.324
LAURA: Werewolves!

01:16:32.324 --> 01:16:39.421
MATT: You watch as it leaps onto the back of this
fallen villager, bites into the shoulder, and tears

01:16:39.421 --> 01:16:45.757
a chunk out. Swallows it before it growls into the
air (yipping howl).

01:16:45.757 --> 01:16:47.553
LAURA: Is that a werehyena?

01:16:47.553 --> 01:16:49.898
SAM: Have we seen these things before?

01:16:49.898 --> 01:16:53.174
MATT: You have. You've encountered a roving band
of these on your way southward.

01:16:53.174 --> 01:16:54.761
LAURA: What is it?

01:16:54.761 --> 01:17:00.992
SAM: I think they're-- well, we don't know what
they're called. We just fought them. I don't know

01:17:00.992 --> 01:17:02.887
what they're called; we fought one before!

01:17:02.887 --> 01:17:04.206
LAURA: You know how to kill them?

01:17:04.206 --> 01:17:06.017
SAM: You just hurt them until they die.

01:17:06.017 --> 01:17:13.576
MATT: It swallows the flesh, grabs the body, and
then darts back into the city, dragging the corpse

01:17:13.576 --> 01:17:15.966
of the villager it's just killed with it
rapidly.

01:17:16.006 --> 01:17:17.505
TALIESIN: That's weird.

01:17:17.505 --> 01:17:21.327
LIAM: Is it a walled-in city or just parts here
and there?

01:17:21.327 --> 01:17:25.271
MATT: No. They're small and waist high, and
shoulder high walls that are partitions here and

01:17:25.271 --> 01:17:27.403
there, but it's largely a farming city.

01:17:27.403 --> 01:17:28.338
LIAM: Not fortified at all?

01:17:28.338 --> 01:17:29.332
MATT: No, not at all.

01:17:29.332 --> 01:17:30.743
LAURA: Is he within range to hit with a spell?

01:17:30.743 --> 01:17:34.825
MATT: No, he's about-- well, depends on the spell.
Right now he's about 200 feet from you and he's

01:17:34.825 --> 01:17:38.775
running into the city. You can see the flames are
further in but you can see the orange glow

01:17:38.775 --> 01:17:40.155
flickering in the distance.

01:17:40.155 --> 01:17:43.639
MARISHA: Can I do a quick scan and see if I see
more?

01:17:43.639 --> 01:17:45.272
MATT: Perception check.

01:17:45.272 --> 01:17:50.314
MARISHA: Don't fuck this up. That's okay, 17.

01:17:50.314 --> 01:17:55.857
MATT: 17. In the immediate vicinity, you do not.
You see more people from the village starting to

01:17:55.857 --> 01:18:00.819
run out, screaming. You see a handful of
crownsguard come out, one of them looks wounded

01:18:00.819 --> 01:18:06.573
and is, "To the north. Where are they coming
from?" You see the two of them dart off northward

01:18:06.573 --> 01:18:08.753
into the city. What are you guys doing?

01:18:08.753 --> 01:18:10.270
TRAVIS: I chase after the crownsguard.

01:18:10.270 --> 01:18:11.475
MATT: Okay.

01:18:11.475 --> 01:18:14.496
LAURA: Go after the one that stole the guy.

01:18:14.496 --> 01:18:16.168
MARISHA: We'll go after the one that stole the
guy.

01:18:16.168 --> 01:18:19.236
TALIESIN: Is this making my spider sense tingle,
can I track them?

01:18:19.236 --> 01:18:21.256
MATT: No.

01:18:21.256 --> 01:18:22.443
TALIESIN: Okay.

01:18:22.443 --> 01:18:28.643
MATT: You get the sense, at the moment, there's no
active idea that these would be considered a

01:18:28.643 --> 01:18:30.243
creature that would draw your attention.

01:18:30.243 --> 01:18:31.685
TALIESIN: Okay, all right.

01:18:31.685 --> 01:18:34.633
MATT: Are you leaving the cart there, on the
outskirts?

01:18:34.633 --> 01:18:35.702
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:18:35.702 --> 01:18:38.293
LIAM: We leave the toilet behind and we run in.

01:18:38.293 --> 01:18:43.012
MATT: All right, as you go charging into the city,
you're pushing past fleeing villagers and you can

01:18:43.012 --> 01:18:47.252
see some of the buildings now have been locked
shut. You can see faintly through the windows

01:18:47.252 --> 01:18:51.670
furniture being boarded up from the inside. People
are hunkering down for whatever this assault is.

01:18:51.670 --> 01:18:56.814
As you enter, you see the crownsguard went
northward but the one creature that you saw charge

01:18:56.814 --> 01:19:01.890
in went straight towards the heart. Right now you
can see there's two main streets that bisect this

01:19:01.890 --> 01:19:07.264
small village. There's one that goes at an angle,
northwest to southeast. One that goes right

01:19:07.264 --> 01:19:11.988
towards the center, west to east. As you head
towards the center you can see the flames are more

01:19:11.988 --> 01:19:17.792
near that central square. As you guys begin to
run, push past a few more people, the smoke is

01:19:17.792 --> 01:19:22.299
starting to billow up and you can see now there's
embers rising and then falling. This very faint

01:19:22.299 --> 01:19:28.341
ashy rain of small points of reddish-orange light
that begin to fall with the ash. As you turn

01:19:28.341 --> 01:19:33.666
around one of the buildings, there's one of the
side walls and four crownsguard all ducked down

01:19:33.666 --> 01:19:40.311
behind the wall with crossbows and longbows, all
back behind it. You can see one that's adorned

01:19:40.311 --> 01:19:50.509
with more ornate armor. You see a person there
with elven features, but hint at a mixed

01:19:50.578 --> 01:19:55.181
lineage. They have their helmet on the ground,
showing shoulder-length blond hair that's turned

01:19:55.221 --> 01:20:00.297
red in places from a spattering of gore. Through
gritted teeth they curse in pain as the bandages

01:20:00.297 --> 01:20:04.746
are applied to what you can see is a wound right
around the midsection in the thigh area. Another

01:20:04.746 --> 01:20:10.582
soldier is in the process of wrapping it. You
watch as they go, "Gah! You fool, bind the wound,

01:20:10.582 --> 01:20:16.733
"don't stuff it." Goes and they pull a bolt back
into the crossbow and nock it at the ready.

01:20:16.733 --> 01:20:23.382
Glancing up and seeing you approach, they scan
past you-- most of you now with weapons at the

01:20:23.382 --> 01:20:31.475
ready, it seems, charging forward. "You!" You
suddenly have an array of arrows, about five or

01:20:31.475 --> 01:20:35.812
six, come over the wall. One of them manages to
pierce the back of one of the crownsguards' heads

01:20:35.812 --> 01:20:43.816
and falls and crumples to the ground. They all get
lower again. You hear in the distance (growling yips).

01:20:43.816 --> 01:20:49.781
The individual looks back to you. "You, are
you able-bodied?"

01:20:49.781 --> 01:20:51.066
LAURA: Yeah.

01:20:51.066 --> 01:20:52.230
SAM: Very.

01:20:52.230 --> 01:20:53.660
MATT: "And you're armed."

01:20:53.660 --> 01:20:55.055
TRAVIS: We are.

01:20:55.055 --> 01:20:58.591
MATT: "30 gold a gnoll ear. Now get in there and
help."

01:20:58.591 --> 01:21:00.206
TRAVIS: A gnoll?

01:21:00.206 --> 01:21:02.025
MARISHA: 30 gold a gnoll ear?

01:21:02.025 --> 01:21:03.899
LAURA: For each one? How many are there?

01:21:03.899 --> 01:21:05.517
TRAVIS: Just go get them.

01:21:05.517 --> 01:21:10.148
MATT: They give you a look like-- "Just go!"

01:21:10.148 --> 01:21:13.293
LAURA: I just don't want to get overwhelmed is
all.

01:21:13.293 --> 01:21:18.745
MARISHA: Nott and Jester, do you guys have ways to
block arrows?

01:21:18.745 --> 01:21:22.040
MATT: (whoosh) Two of them glace up and fire two
crossbow bolts over the wall and duck back behind.

01:21:22.040 --> 01:21:28.536
You hear a heavy smashing of wood, some more barks
and gibbering echoing around the way. You can see

01:21:28.536 --> 01:21:32.536
now flames curling up to the top of the building
that you're all right next to, before the small

01:21:32.613 --> 01:21:34.963
wall that bisects the entryway.

01:21:34.963 --> 01:21:36.214
LAURA: I have a shield.

01:21:36.214 --> 01:21:37.893
TALIESIN: I start one of my swords on the back of
my neck.

01:21:37.893 --> 01:21:41.243
LIAM : We are sitting ducks here. What do we do,
Fjord?

01:21:41.243 --> 01:21:43.071
TRAVIS: It's all on the other side of a wall?

01:21:43.071 --> 01:21:44.284
MATT: Correct.

01:21:44.284 --> 01:21:45.959
MARISHA: Let's go towards the wall.

01:21:45.959 --> 01:21:47.756
MATT: To give you perspective now.

01:21:47.756 --> 01:21:52.892
SAM: Oh. This'll help. Hey side note: where's my
fucking wine?

01:21:52.892 --> 01:21:55.360
LAURA: Did you leave it?

01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:56.956
TRAVIS: You mean your water?

01:21:56.956 --> 01:21:58.291
MARISHA: Did you leave it outside?

01:21:58.291 --> 01:21:59.446
SAM: Is it gone?

01:21:59.446 --> 01:22:00.845
MARISHA: No, it's just on the table.

01:22:00.845 --> 01:22:06.344
LAURA: Whoa! Oh my gosh. Where are we?

01:22:06.344 --> 01:22:09.522
MATT: You guys--

01:22:09.522 --> 01:22:13.234
LAURA: This is so cool. Look at that flame on the
side of the roof.

01:22:13.234 --> 01:22:22.705
MATT: You are all right over this side area,
corner. Arrange yourself as you feel you wish to

01:22:22.705 --> 01:22:27.862
be. Over there on the far end of the village.

01:22:27.862 --> 01:22:30.180
SAM: Oh wow. What a cool map.

01:22:30.180 --> 01:22:33.130
MATT: If you wish to, you can place yourselves
where you wish or show me where you want them to go.

01:22:33.130 --> 01:22:39.879
LIAM: I would be pressed against the wall of that
house.

01:22:39.879 --> 01:22:41.449
MATT: Right here?

01:22:41.449 --> 01:22:46.426
LAURA: Before I ran over here, I'm going to Caleb.
I'll hit you on the shoulder and say, bless you.

01:22:46.426 --> 01:22:51.487
And I'm going to give you Blessing of the
Trickster just in case you want to stealth because

01:22:51.487 --> 01:22:53.105
you're squishy, yo.

01:22:53.105 --> 01:22:54.658
LIAM: Okay, so I have advantage on stealth?

01:22:54.658 --> 01:22:55.550
LAURA: Yes.

01:22:55.550 --> 01:22:56.467
LIAM: Thank you.

01:22:56.467 --> 01:22:57.756
MARISHA: I'll be with Jester.

01:22:57.756 --> 01:23:02.063
SAM: The enemies are just all over that
direction, right?

01:23:02.063 --> 01:23:05.702
MATT: With what little bit you've looked over to
the side you can see there are some up on the

01:23:05.702 --> 01:23:10.529
rooftops in the distance. You can see their dark
figures silhouetted by flames, and other bits of

01:23:10.529 --> 01:23:16.919
light that normally fill the streets in the center
of the city. Most you can see are these up here and

01:23:16.919 --> 01:23:20.343
you can already see a few bodies of guards and
civilians that are lying on the ground, carved

01:23:20.381 --> 01:23:24.925
open and not moving. You see spatters of blood.
You still hear them barking and giving orders next

01:23:24.925 --> 01:23:27.546
to each other (rabid barking).

01:23:27.546 --> 01:23:33.858
LAURA: How far away are the ones on the roof?
How long is the distance from us?

01:23:33.858 --> 01:23:37.657
MATT: Over here? At this distance it's hard to
say. I'd say probably in the neighborhood of about

01:23:37.657 --> 01:23:45.910
70 to 80 feet from you. You guys, I would like, if
you are trying to stay out of sight, make a

01:23:45.910 --> 01:23:50.263
stealth check, please. Those of you with a point
of exhaustion, you have disadvantage.

01:23:50.263 --> 01:23:53.588
MARISHA: Natural 19.

01:23:53.588 --> 01:23:57.649
LAURA: Six.

01:23:57.649 --> 01:23:59.166
TALIESIN: 21.

01:23:59.166 --> 01:24:00.376
SAM: 15.

01:24:00.376 --> 01:24:01.446
LIAM: 16.

01:24:01.446 --> 01:24:02.605
MARISHA: 25.

01:24:02.605 --> 01:24:03.644
TRAVIS: 14.

01:24:03.644 --> 01:24:07.488
SAM: So revealing--

01:24:07.488 --> 01:24:09.488
LAURA: Yeah, well, I'm exhausted.

01:24:09.488 --> 01:24:14.325
MATT: That's okay. As a group, for the moment you
guys haven't drawn their attention. You're still

01:24:14.325 --> 01:24:19.358
right next to where there are crownsguard who are
in the process of a firefight with whatever is in

01:24:19.358 --> 01:24:27.170
this vicinity of the city. However, you may or may
not make it through, for the moment, unseen. You're

01:24:27.170 --> 01:24:32.075
not certain how many there are. But you can hear a
lot of yipping and growling right around this

01:24:32.075 --> 01:24:36.458
large, two-story building that is currently
engulfed in flames.

01:24:36.458 --> 01:24:41.041
SAM: I have an idea. We need to move away from
here, right, Fjord?

01:24:41.041 --> 01:24:43.424
TRAVIS: We do. We have to use the cover of the
buildings.

01:24:43.424 --> 01:24:50.825
SAM: All right, I think I can do something that
would make them fire many of their arrows at

01:24:50.825 --> 01:24:56.272
something, but not us. Should I do that and then
as soon as they fire their arrows we can run?

01:24:56.272 --> 01:24:57.781
TRAVIS: Diversions are absolutely--

01:24:57.781 --> 01:25:05.372
SAM: Diversions! That's what it's called, it's a
diversion. All right, may I move, is that a thing?

01:25:05.372 --> 01:25:07.052
MATT: You may, you're stealthed currently.

01:25:07.052 --> 01:25:13.048
SAM: I take out a bit of fleece, and repeating the
words and doing the hand gestures that I've been

01:25:13.048 --> 01:25:22.243
taught and tracing the image of a creature on the
fleece, I will make a Silent Image of the guard

01:25:22.243 --> 01:25:30.515
who told us 30 gold a gnoll. I'm going to have the
image of that guard dash across, slowly, dash

01:25:30.515 --> 01:25:33.216
across this alleyway. Like that way.

01:25:33.216 --> 01:25:35.738
LIAM: Maybe amble more than dash.

01:25:35.738 --> 01:25:40.882
SAM: Yes, not dash, just walk in a way that he
could be easily shot.

01:25:40.882 --> 01:25:46.366
MATT: Interesting point of order, you're not too
certain of the gender of this individual, kind of fluid.

01:25:46.366 --> 01:25:49.298
SAM: Okay, great, that long-haired guard
individual.

01:25:49.298 --> 01:25:55.422
MATT: There you go. As the figure leaps over the
wall and begins making a run towards the center

01:25:55.422 --> 01:26:03.249
area, about four different arrows pass through its
form before one of these gnoll creatures goes

01:26:03.249 --> 01:26:08.681
lumbering forward and slashes out to it. This
gnoll, interestingly enough-- the other ones you

01:26:08.681 --> 01:26:13.674
see and the one you saw before the city are all
built and muscular. This one seems to be porous.

01:26:13.674 --> 01:26:19.903
With a brief bit of view, you can see there's
clumps of fur and exposed bone and part of its

01:26:19.903 --> 01:26:26.018
skull is just pushing out of its snout with teeth
gnashing. As it tears into the illusion, it claws

01:26:26.018 --> 01:26:32.538
through, confused, and looks over in your direction.
As you're finishing drawing your blade across your

01:26:32.538 --> 01:26:38.475
back, what normally would be cold energy suddenly
flickers into this beacon of bright white light.

01:26:38.475 --> 01:26:43.326
SAM: Ooh, nice.

01:26:43.326 --> 01:26:46.728
MATT: Something clicks in your mind and you're
like, "Oh, I know you."

01:26:46.728 --> 01:26:49.978
TALIESIN: I'm preparing. How close am I to this
thing?

01:26:49.978 --> 01:26:54.318
MATT: This entity would be here now. It would have
just left out into that section there.

01:26:54.318 --> 01:26:55.761
TALIESIN: Does it see us?

01:26:55.761 --> 01:26:57.051
MATT: It does now.

01:26:57.051 --> 01:26:59.288
TALIESIN: I'm going to use Vicious Mockery at it,
really quickly.

01:26:59.288 --> 01:27:00.490
MATT: All right.

01:27:00.490 --> 01:27:01.978
LAURA: Can I invoke Duplicity?

01:27:01.978 --> 01:27:05.289
MATT: You may. I'm giving you all one round
preparation before we roll initiative.

01:27:05.289 --> 01:27:11.732
TRAVIS: Yeah, I was going to say, we're in it.
This is a fight. So anything you want to do now,

01:27:11.732 --> 01:27:13.238
do it.

01:27:13.238 --> 01:27:20.047
LIAM: I mutter a few words and my form starts to
blink in and out of view. There is another Caleb

01:27:20.047 --> 01:27:25.137
next to me and another Caleb next to me. Shifting,
blinking, flashing back and forth and it's hard to

01:27:25.137 --> 01:27:26.638
see where I am.

01:27:26.638 --> 01:27:29.156
MATT: Okay. Is that concentration?

01:27:29.156 --> 01:27:30.532
LIAM: Yeah, it is.

01:27:30.532 --> 01:27:33.509
MATT: All right, I'm going to put a concentration
marker on you just so we remember it.

01:27:33.509 --> 01:27:41.083
TRAVIS: Can I also, knowing that we're probably
going to be up close, danger close, I'm going to

01:27:41.083 --> 01:27:48.384
cast Armor of Agathys on myself. You see a
spectral frost start to harden around my armor in

01:27:48.384 --> 01:27:50.244
a shimmering light.

01:27:50.244 --> 01:27:55.339
MATT: That's cool. So that's you. That's you.
You're going to Vicious Mockery.

01:27:55.339 --> 01:27:59.808
TALIESIN: I'm going to use Vicious Mockery. I'm
going to look at him with my eyes glowing, and my

01:27:59.808 --> 01:28:07.282
sword glowing, and in Infernal say, (rasping) The
light comes to blind your eyes and burn your

01:28:07.282 --> 01:28:10.191
flesh. Yeah, 1d4.

01:28:10.191 --> 01:28:14.967
MATT: He rolled a 13 minus three. I believe it's
wisdom, correct?

01:28:14.967 --> 01:28:17.579
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's a wisdom saving throw.

01:28:17.579 --> 01:28:21.156
MATT: I'm pretty sure that's a ten and that does
not make your DC.

01:28:21.156 --> 01:28:32.118
TALIESIN: Yup, so he takes three psychic damage
and he has disadvantage on his next attack roll.

01:28:32.118 --> 01:28:33.235
MATT: Yes.

01:28:33.235 --> 01:28:36.297
TALIESIN: I'm going to use my bonus action-- yeah,
fuck it, let's go for it-- I'm going to activate

01:28:36.297 --> 01:28:37.540
both swords.

01:28:37.540 --> 01:28:39.935
MATT: You drag the other edge of your blade--

01:28:39.935 --> 01:28:41.215
TALIESIN: Should I? Yeah.

01:28:41.215 --> 01:28:47.957
MATT: You've taken a total of six damage and your
max HP is down by six. But you have currently the

01:28:47.957 --> 01:28:50.532
new invoked Rite on each blade.

01:28:50.532 --> 01:28:53.678
LAURA: Can I use my bonus action really fast?

01:28:53.678 --> 01:28:54.958
MATT: You may.

01:28:54.958 --> 01:29:02.783
LAURA: To say a little pray to the Traveler, and
I'm going to cast Spiritual Weapon.

01:29:02.783 --> 01:29:05.644
MATT: You may do that. Where are you going to cast
it?

01:29:05.644 --> 01:29:11.640
LAURA: I'm going to cast it right above this
zombie gnoll. It's going to be in the shape of a

01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:19.736
giant lollipop. Like a bludgeoning lollipop.

01:29:19.736 --> 01:29:30.308
MATT: You watch as this flash of purplish energy
suddenly apparates into the air. This thick-like

01:29:30.308 --> 01:29:37.523
wooden handle that is jammed into a massive,
bludgeoning, solid piece of sugary goodness.

01:29:37.523 --> 01:29:39.133
LAURA: Yes!

01:29:39.133 --> 01:29:40.520
LIAM: The old fashioned swirly kind?

01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:41.639
LAURA: Yeah!

01:29:41.639 --> 01:29:47.978
MATT: With that, you can make an attack with that
as soon as it comes out. Make a melee spell

01:29:47.978 --> 01:29:49.528
attack, please.

01:29:49.528 --> 01:29:52.697
LAURA: Okay, 17?

01:29:52.697 --> 01:29:54.330
MATT: 17 does hit.

01:29:54.330 --> 01:30:00.288
LAURA: Ooh, seven. Seven radiant damage.

01:30:00.288 --> 01:30:06.501
MATT: Seven radiant damage, nice. As it strikes
down, wham! From the creature, already watching

01:30:06.501 --> 01:30:09.731
its bones and its form shakes--

01:30:09.731 --> 01:30:14.436
LAURA: Oh wait, oh wait, oh wait, I was looking at
the wrong spell, hold on. Oh, 1d8 plus three!

01:30:14.436 --> 01:30:16.843
Seven plus three-- Ten!

01:30:16.843 --> 01:30:22.838
MATT: Ten. Oh, that'll be enough. You watch as it
pulls back with the Infernal shouting of Mollymauk

01:30:22.838 --> 01:30:29.594
causing it to prepare itself for a lunge. As it
gets low, its jaw snapping open, you watch as bits

01:30:29.594 --> 01:30:35.932
of its skin fall onto the ground as it does so
(snarl). And right before it leaps, (wham) it just

01:30:35.932 --> 01:30:39.537
smashes it into the ground and its bones go flying
and scattering in every which direction.

01:30:39.537 --> 01:30:41.183
ALL: Oh!

01:30:41.183 --> 01:30:43.681
TRAVIS: Is that one of the were-thingies? Damn!

01:30:43.681 --> 01:30:45.215
LAURA: That ear is mine!

01:30:45.215 --> 01:30:52.354
MATT: All right, so Beau, what are you doing? You
all have one round of prep. Right now, you've gone--

01:30:52.354 --> 01:30:54.459
SAM: I cast a spell. Can I also move?

01:30:54.459 --> 01:30:55.639
MATT: You can move, yeah.

01:30:55.639 --> 01:30:59.800
SAM: As soon as the arrows flew by, I'm going to
dash across the alley.

01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:01.000
MATT: Okay.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.155
LAURA: And I'm going to send my duplicate after
her.

01:31:03.155 --> 01:31:06.476
MATT: Okay. You're running that way?

01:31:06.476 --> 01:31:08.038
SAM: Yep. As far as I can go.

01:31:08.038 --> 01:31:13.944
MATT: All right. And you send your duplicate over
there as well?

01:31:13.944 --> 01:31:14.959
LAURA: Yeah.

01:31:14.959 --> 01:31:17.591
MATT: All righty. And Beau?

01:31:17.591 --> 01:31:27.665
MARISHA: I'm also going to use my speed to dash
across. I can move 40. Can I peek into this window

01:31:27.665 --> 01:31:29.729
and see if I can see anything in here?

01:31:29.729 --> 01:31:34.984
MATT: Sure. Easy to see in this perspective. You
glance inside--

01:31:34.984 --> 01:31:36.289
MARISHA: Stealthily?

01:31:36.289 --> 01:31:39.738
MATT: All right. As you glance inside, you can
just barely see around the corner. The place is

01:31:39.738 --> 01:31:47.792
tossed. It is shattered and ruined. It looks like
it was once the interior of a small tavern of some

01:31:47.792 --> 01:31:52.811
kind, but the kitchen is wrecked and you can see
two of these gnolls are in the process of grabbing

01:31:52.811 --> 01:31:56.708
large sacks out of the kitchen and pulling them
out through the front door on the opposite side of

01:31:56.708 --> 01:31:57.865
the building.

01:31:57.865 --> 01:32:05.713
MARISHA: Oh shit. Okay. I turn to Nott. I go--

01:32:05.713 --> 01:32:07.532
SAM: Look at two unicorns inside?

01:32:07.532 --> 01:32:10.030
MARISHA: The gnolls!

01:32:10.030 --> 01:32:11.592
SAM: They're inside the--?

01:32:11.592 --> 01:32:12.410
MARISHA: Shh.

01:32:12.410 --> 01:32:14.455
MATT: I would like you all now to roll
initiative.

01:32:14.455 --> 01:32:18.068
MARISHA: Natural 20.

01:32:18.068 --> 01:32:20.689
ALL: Whoa.

01:32:20.689 --> 01:32:23.298
MARISHA: That's the second one of the night.

01:32:23.298 --> 01:32:25.262
SAM: Oh wait, is this an ability check?

01:32:25.262 --> 01:32:27.756
MATT: Yes, so these are with disadvantage.

01:32:27.756 --> 01:32:28.850
LAURA: Oh, really?

01:32:28.850 --> 01:32:30.632
LIAM: Oh, scheiß.

01:32:30.632 --> 01:32:33.672
MARISHA: No good?

01:32:33.712 --> 01:32:34.861
LIAM: That was worse.

01:32:34.861 --> 01:32:35.895
MARISHA: Oh no.

01:32:35.895 --> 01:32:37.223
TRAVIS: (German accent) That was worse.

01:32:37.223 --> 01:32:40.243
LIAM: That was already bad.

01:32:40.243 --> 01:32:42.696
LAURA: Initiative is an ability?

01:32:42.696 --> 01:32:44.187
MATT: It is.

01:32:44.187 --> 01:32:45.523
LAURA: Are attack rolls?

01:32:45.523 --> 01:32:46.722
SAM and MATT: No.

01:32:46.722 --> 01:32:48.215
LAURA: Okay. Did I already ask that?

01:32:48.215 --> 01:32:52.812
SAM: Nope. Don't worry, though; I touched all your
dice, so they're going to roll great tonight.

01:32:52.812 --> 01:32:54.611
LAURA: Thanks. Thanks, Sam.

01:32:54.611 --> 01:32:56.197
TALIESIN: He may have licked a couple of them.

01:32:56.197 --> 01:32:58.397
LAURA: Can you lick this one?

01:32:58.397 --> 01:33:01.581
MATT: 25 to 20, anybody?

01:33:01.581 --> 01:33:03.432
TRAVIS: 25 to 20.

01:33:03.432 --> 01:33:04.674
MARISHA: 24.

01:33:04.674 --> 01:33:07.597
LAURA: I'm going to put it back over here. I'm
going to try it. Maybe it'll roll really well with

01:33:07.597 --> 01:33:08.908
your spit on it.

01:33:08.908 --> 01:33:10.266
TALIESIN: It's a very pretty die.

01:33:10.266 --> 01:33:11.509
LAURA: It's so pretty, right?

01:33:11.509 --> 01:33:13.170
MATT: 20 to 15?

01:33:13.170 --> 01:33:14.764
TRAVIS: 16.

01:33:14.764 --> 01:33:21.243
MATT: 16. All righty. 15 to ten?

01:33:21.243 --> 01:33:24.773
TALIESIN: Nine. Oh, nope, never mind, yeah.

01:33:24.773 --> 01:33:26.358
TRAVIS: Wow, guys. Wow.

01:33:26.358 --> 01:33:27.561
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

01:33:27.561 --> 01:33:29.138
MATT: All right, ten to five.

01:33:29.138 --> 01:33:30.006
TALIESIN: Nine.

01:33:30.006 --> 01:33:30.924
LAURA: Seven.

01:33:30.924 --> 01:33:32.573
LIAM and SAM: Six.

01:33:32.573 --> 01:33:34.014
MATT: Okay, so that order.

01:33:34.014 --> 01:33:37.401
TALIESIN: I want them to get a little closer
anyway. They're all far.

01:33:37.401 --> 01:33:39.087
LIAM: It's all part of the plan.

01:33:39.087 --> 01:33:40.333
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

01:33:40.333 --> 01:33:41.825
TALIESIN: It's going to go great.

01:33:41.825 --> 01:33:45.452
MATT: Molly, then Jester. Then Caleb?

01:33:45.452 --> 01:33:46.492
LIAM: Yeah.

01:33:46.492 --> 01:33:47.697
SAM: And Nott.

01:33:47.697 --> 01:33:48.662
LIAM: What'd you get?

01:33:48.662 --> 01:33:49.585
SAM: Six.

01:33:49.585 --> 01:33:51.199
LIAM: Oh, all together at last.

01:33:51.199 --> 01:33:59.516
MATT: All righty, so. Top of the round, as some of
this has happened. The one gnoll skeletal form has

01:33:59.516 --> 01:34:04.402
shattered onto the ground. Some of the other
gnolls begin to look over in that direction, and

01:34:04.402 --> 01:34:09.924
see a few of you over by the guards now, standing
up and darting over the way. They're preparing for

01:34:09.924 --> 01:34:14.321
some sort of... whatever's coming. But first of the
round is you, Beau.

01:34:14.321 --> 01:34:16.522
MARISHA: I turn to Nott.

01:34:16.522 --> 01:34:17.854
SAM: Huh!?

01:34:17.854 --> 01:34:21.050
MARISHA: Hey, you want to take these guys? You
ready for this?

01:34:21.050 --> 01:34:24.628
SAM: (panicked stuttering) I'm going to drink from
my flask.

01:34:24.628 --> 01:34:30.278
MARISHA: Get ready. I want them to come to this
window, okay? I'm going to go (whistles) through

01:34:30.278 --> 01:34:33.804
the window. Try and get their attention.

01:34:33.804 --> 01:34:35.031
MATT: Okay.

01:34:35.031 --> 01:34:36.062
LAURA: Right there?

01:34:36.062 --> 01:34:37.452
MATT: Make a performance check.

01:34:37.452 --> 01:34:45.480
MARISHA: To whistle? Not great. Not great at all.
Three.

01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:49.414
MATT: All right. The whistle has a bit of volume
to it. Unfortunately, with the sound of all the

01:34:49.414 --> 01:34:53.326
breaking of furniture, them all growling at each
other, and the general screams in the vicinity,

01:34:53.326 --> 01:34:58.047
it's lost in the chaos. It's not necessarily a
quiet atmosphere to draw a guard's attention. The

01:34:58.047 --> 01:35:02.214
gnolls don't seem to care much for a whistle
around the window. They're more focused on

01:35:02.214 --> 01:35:05.321
grabbing and running out the front, other way,
with whatever they're taking.

01:35:05.321 --> 01:35:07.774
MARISHA: Is that my action or a bonus action?

01:35:07.774 --> 01:35:10.422
MATT: I'll let that be like a bonus action, we'll
say.

01:35:10.422 --> 01:35:11.765
MARISHA: Bonus action.

01:35:11.765 --> 01:35:13.730
MATT: Because you were waiting for something to
happen.

01:35:13.730 --> 01:35:14.826
LIAM: Mercer-ful.

01:35:14.826 --> 01:35:23.601
MARISHA: Shit. Going in! I jump through the
window, and before one of them leaves, I'm going

01:35:23.601 --> 01:35:26.221
to crack them with the staff right over the head.

01:35:26.221 --> 01:35:30.352
MATT: Okay. With a 40-foot movement, that brings
you--

01:35:30.352 --> 01:35:32.813
MARISHA: Can I go in through the window?

01:35:32.813 --> 01:35:36.630
MATT: You do. As you go through the window,
because they've mostly shifted into the other room

01:35:36.630 --> 01:35:39.487
now; that's where you see them moving. They're not
in the room that's closest to you, so you go jump

01:35:39.487 --> 01:35:42.537
through the window, over the mass, make your way
through the living room, and you watch as they're

01:35:42.537 --> 01:35:45.321
exiting the door. You get all the way through.

01:35:45.321 --> 01:35:47.354
MARISHA: I thought it was much closer than that.

01:35:47.354 --> 01:35:53.207
MATT: Unfortunately, no. But you do manage to make
it all the way to this door there.

01:35:53.207 --> 01:35:56.766
MARISHA: Oh! They're going out the back door. I
thought they were going out that way!

01:35:56.766 --> 01:35:58.011
MATT: Nope!

01:35:58.011 --> 01:35:58.989
MARISHA: Okay.

01:35:58.989 --> 01:36:01.033
MATT: Is that still what you want to do?

01:36:01.033 --> 01:36:03.619
MARISHA: That's bad disadvantage. Fog of war.

01:36:03.619 --> 01:36:07.802
MATT: Well, here's what you do. As you rush
through to go after them, as they're fleeing out

01:36:07.802 --> 01:36:12.799
the other side, you come to the doorway and you
can see there's one gnoll right in front of you

01:36:12.799 --> 01:36:18.176
that hasn't noticed you rushing behind it. It's
currently throwing a corpse of one of the

01:36:18.176 --> 01:36:23.705
villagers onto a cart that's sitting right outside
of that door. That cart, which is piled up with

01:36:23.705 --> 01:36:27.902
other corpses, and bags, and whatever things they
were robbing from the inside of this building that

01:36:27.902 --> 01:36:31.553
they've thrown onto this cart. You can now see
there's four gnolls that are gathered around it in

01:36:31.553 --> 01:36:34.807
the process of throwing things onto it, and it
looks like they're getting ready to start pushing

01:36:34.807 --> 01:36:38.247
it. They haven't noticed your arrival, as you've
just darted into the doorway. What are you going

01:36:38.247 --> 01:36:39.483
to do?

01:36:39.483 --> 01:36:47.053
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to double ba-- Ah, I can't
move anymore, can I?

01:36:47.053 --> 01:36:48.959
MATT: No, that was your move to get there.

01:36:48.959 --> 01:36:53.719
MARISHA: I'm going to spend a ki point and do
Patient Defense.

01:36:53.719 --> 01:36:58.982
MATT: Well, as your action you can just go into it
without having to spend a ki point.

01:36:59.025 --> 01:37:00.063
MARISHA: Oh, really?

01:37:00.063 --> 01:37:02.920
MATT: Because you already used your bonus action.
The ki point allows you to do it as a bonus

01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:04.634
action, but you can just do it as an action any
time.

01:37:04.634 --> 01:37:06.072
MARISHA: Ooh. Great, I'll do that.

01:37:06.072 --> 01:37:07.230
MATT: You just go into the dodge action.

01:37:07.230 --> 01:37:09.168
MARISHA: I'll just hold back and wait.

01:37:09.168 --> 01:37:11.951
MATT: Right, so you're holding back in the
doorway, and you're ready to use the door to help

01:37:11.951 --> 01:37:15.116
defend you if it needs to. Okay, that ends Beau's
turn. It's now their turn.

01:37:15.116 --> 01:37:17.443
TRAVIS: Oh, shit, already? Oh god.

01:37:17.443 --> 01:37:20.190
TALIESIN: Yeah, this is what was coming.

01:37:20.190 --> 01:37:21.762
MATT: They rolled really high in the initiative.

01:37:21.762 --> 01:37:23.180
TRAVIS: What are we calling these things?

01:37:23.180 --> 01:37:24.053
ALL: Gnolls.

01:37:24.053 --> 01:37:25.129
LIAM: G-N-O-L-L.

01:37:25.129 --> 01:37:28.928
MARISHA: I thought I was going to still be a lot
closer to Nott.

01:37:28.928 --> 01:37:30.471
LIAM: (sings) G-N-O-L-L.

01:37:30.471 --> 01:37:31.977
LAURA: (sings) K-N-O-L-L

01:37:31.977 --> 01:37:34.286
MATT: Visibly off to the side, there is...

01:37:34.286 --> 01:37:36.704
SAM: N-O-L-L?

01:37:36.704 --> 01:37:41.044
MATT: Yeah, that's going to be two of them firing
their bow-- Actually, no, three, because they

01:37:41.044 --> 01:37:44.162
watched you come out. There's three of them that
are going to be firing their bows at Beau.

01:37:44.162 --> 01:37:45.670
LAURA: Oh no!

01:37:45.670 --> 01:37:48.341
SAM: Beau, bow, Beau, and bow?

01:37:48.341 --> 01:37:50.836
LIAM: Bobobo-bo bo-bobo.

01:37:50.836 --> 01:37:53.263
MATT: They all have disadvantage on the attack,
however.

01:37:53.263 --> 01:37:54.981
SAM: She's in Patient Defense; she's going to be
fine.

01:37:54.981 --> 01:38:00.514
MATT: As this one fires off in the direction of
your duplicitous form, as it disappears through.

01:38:00.514 --> 01:38:06.326
As it's the only thing it can visually see. It's
going to stay behind the wall. That's three

01:38:06.326 --> 01:38:08.179
attacks at disadvantage against Beau.

01:38:08.179 --> 01:38:09.496
MARISHA: And they all have disadvantage.

01:38:09.496 --> 01:38:10.401
MATT: They do.

01:38:10.401 --> 01:38:11.672
MARISHA: Because I did Patient Defense?

01:38:11.672 --> 01:38:12.998
SAM: You're going to be fine.

01:38:12.998 --> 01:38:17.165
MATT: First one with a longbow, that's a 15?

01:38:17.165 --> 01:38:18.328
MARISHA: Miss.

01:38:18.328 --> 01:38:23.666
MATT: Right. Misses. The first one, you watch as
it just moves past you and slams into the door.

01:38:23.666 --> 01:38:25.714
The next one, from this guy up here--

01:38:25.714 --> 01:38:28.614
MARISHA: I immediately go: whoops.

01:38:28.614 --> 01:38:35.592
MATT: That's a 12 and a two. The other one misses
into the wall. This one over here is going to fire

01:38:35.592 --> 01:38:42.119
at you. That's a 16 and a 14, plus three, 17.

01:38:42.119 --> 01:38:45.009
MARISHA: 17 is my armor class.

01:38:45.009 --> 01:38:48.613
MATT: The first two: one hits the door; the other
one, you duck out of the way; and the third one

01:38:48.613 --> 01:39:00.036
comes and it's piercing right towards your chest.
It's going to deal 2d8, seven points of piercing damage.

01:39:00.036 --> 01:39:03.161
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to use Deflect Missiles
for my reaction.

01:39:03.161 --> 01:39:06.356
MATT: Oh, right! Because you got that for your--
Okay. As a reaction, you watch this one arrow that

01:39:06.356 --> 01:39:07.667
you can't quite duck out of the way--

01:39:07.667 --> 01:39:09.441
MARISHA: (grunting exertions)

01:39:09.441 --> 01:39:10.824
MATT: All right. So go ahead and make the roll.

01:39:10.824 --> 01:39:14.291
MARISHA: But it's not super-- I'm still level
three, so it's more like a cat swat.

01:39:14.291 --> 01:39:17.034
MATT: Yeah, you're trying to swat it and see if
you can carry the momentum with it.

01:39:17.034 --> 01:39:18.398
LAURA: 20!

01:39:18.398 --> 01:39:23.367
MARISHA: That is seven on the dice, plus seven,
14.

01:39:23.367 --> 01:39:25.238
MATT: You reduce the damage to zero and you catch
it.

01:39:25.238 --> 01:39:27.105
SAM: Whoa.

01:39:27.105 --> 01:39:30.477
MATT: If you want to, you can spend a ki point to
throw it, if you want to.

01:39:30.477 --> 01:39:31.826
TRAVIS: Oh! Throw that shit!

01:39:31.826 --> 01:39:33.428
MARISHA: Yeah, let's do it! Just because I can!

01:39:33.428 --> 01:39:34.705
MATT: All right, where are you throwing it to?

01:39:34.705 --> 01:39:37.077
TRAVIS: In the foot.

01:39:37.077 --> 01:39:38.594
LIAM: At the bitch who attacked you.

01:39:38.594 --> 01:39:39.671
SAM: Or the guy in front of you.

01:39:39.671 --> 01:39:43.651
MARISHA: I'm going to do it at the guy in front of
me, who's right behind me.

01:39:43.651 --> 01:39:44.787
MATT: Okay.

01:39:44.787 --> 01:39:47.748
MARISHA: So I'm going to catch it, and I'm going
to spin around in a full flourish, and I'm going

01:39:47.748 --> 01:39:51.327
to just throw it like a Gambit card with the
momentum that it's got.

01:39:51.327 --> 01:39:55.603
MATT: All right, so as you grab it, you spin
around and throw it. Go ahead and make the attack roll.

01:39:55.603 --> 01:39:57.547
MARISHA: What's the attack roll?

01:39:57.547 --> 01:39:59.090
MATT: It should be your--

01:39:59.090 --> 01:40:01.084
MARISHA: What is it? I've never done this before!

01:40:01.084 --> 01:40:02.312
MATT: I know. This is new.

01:40:02.312 --> 01:40:03.719
MARISHA: It's brand new!

01:40:03.719 --> 01:40:15.310
MATT: Here we go. You just make a ranged attack
with it, so roll a d20, add your dexterity modifier

01:40:15.310 --> 01:40:19.907
and your proficiency modifier, so same as any of
your other attacks, because it counts as a monk weapon.

01:40:19.907 --> 01:40:21.466
MARISHA: Okay, 16.

01:40:21.466 --> 01:40:25.530
MATT: 16 hits. It takes 1d8, so roll 1d8, plus
two.

01:40:25.530 --> 01:40:29.517
MARISHA: Four. Four damage total.

01:40:29.517 --> 01:40:34.885
MATT: All right. I wonder, does it add your damage
bonus to it, or the original weapon, because it is

01:40:34.885 --> 01:40:38.288
your strength throwing it back. Pardon me, folks,
while we're figuring out new abilities they can use.

01:40:38.288 --> 01:40:42.898
MARISHA: You make the attack with proficiency and
the missile counts as a monk weapon for the attack.

01:40:42.898 --> 01:40:44.817
MATT: It is your attack, so you get to add your
dex bonus.

01:40:44.817 --> 01:40:46.649
MARISHA: So six total.

01:40:46.649 --> 01:40:54.382
MATT: All right, so six points of damage. You
watch as the arrow just sinks into the chest of

01:40:54.382 --> 01:40:57.955
its thick hide armor. (snarling)

01:40:57.955 --> 01:41:01.687
MARISHA: I go: Hah! Ooh.

01:41:01.687 --> 01:41:06.439
MATT: The other ones that are throwing stuff onto
the cart hear this commotion and turn around and

01:41:06.439 --> 01:41:10.019
look at you. Three of them continue just throwing
stuff onto the cart faster, while the one that's

01:41:10.019 --> 01:41:15.993
immediately in front of you spins around and
stands tall. You can see it looking down at you a full

01:41:15.993 --> 01:41:22.018
foot and a half, almost two feet taller than you.
(snarling) It's going to go ahead and grabs a

01:41:22.018 --> 01:41:26.132
spear off the side of the wall that it had leaning
against and it's going to try to thrust it at you.

01:41:26.132 --> 01:41:33.671
It still has disadvantage on the attack, though,
because you're in your stance. That's 16.

01:41:33.671 --> 01:41:34.846
MARISHA: Miss.

01:41:34.846 --> 01:41:39.310
MATT: This one, as it goes and thrusts with the
spear, coming off of the adrenaline of the

01:41:39.310 --> 01:41:44.538
deflected missile, you duck low, and then kick the
spear up, which slams into the top of the door frame

01:41:44.538 --> 01:41:48.815
and completely misses you. He's now stepping into
the door frame, completely filling it as you're

01:41:48.815 --> 01:41:53.767
backing up into your space, and the two of you are
in this very intense, small, occupied block.

01:41:53.767 --> 01:41:57.118
MARISHA: And I go: no, seriously dude, did you see
that?!

01:41:57.118 --> 01:41:59.952
TRAVIS: My legs are jumping around like crazy
right now.

01:41:59.952 --> 01:42:09.915
MATT: These guys are going to begin pushing the
cart and it's going to move at half their movement

01:42:09.915 --> 01:42:23.708
to there. This one here is going to move up to
here, right around the side of this wall, and it's

01:42:23.708 --> 01:42:28.299
going to take its longbow and fire at you,
because you're the one they can see.

01:42:28.299 --> 01:42:29.953
MARISHA: That's fair.

01:42:29.953 --> 01:42:31.637
MATT: Disadvantage. That is a 15.

01:42:31.637 --> 01:42:32.728
MARISHA: Miss.

01:42:32.728 --> 01:42:37.016
MATT: This one, actually, you see over at the
fire, and you grab the front of the armor of the

01:42:37.016 --> 01:42:42.693
gnoll and pull his in front of you, and it actually
hits the back of his armor, splintering it, and

01:42:42.693 --> 01:42:43.977
the smell hits you.

01:42:43.977 --> 01:42:45.710
MARISHA: I just go, excuse me for a second. Thank
you.

01:42:45.710 --> 01:42:52.187
MATT: As you let him go, there's this thick, oily,
horrible liquid that's matted in the fur, and the

01:42:52.187 --> 01:43:02.916
touch of it's nasty. The smell itself is very
acrid of rotting flesh and mangy fur. That's going

01:43:02.916 --> 01:43:06.537
to end all those guys there, they're pushing
there. All right, that ends the gnolls' turn.

01:43:06.537 --> 01:43:08.392
Fjord, you're up.

01:43:08.392 --> 01:43:16.578
TRAVIS: Yeah, okay. With my 30 feet of movement,
can I wrap around the far side of the house and

01:43:16.578 --> 01:43:18.417
just get to cover of the corner?

01:43:18.417 --> 01:43:19.908
MATT: That's exactly where you can get.

01:43:19.908 --> 01:43:22.350
TRAVIS: Now there is an individual over there that
sucks, right?

01:43:22.350 --> 01:43:26.340
MATT: Correct. You see it has a longbow and is
currently reaching back and it's pulling another

01:43:26.340 --> 01:43:28.369
arrow and getting it notched up.

01:43:28.369 --> 01:43:31.845
TRAVIS: I beg for forgiveness, I'm going to try
some shit. I would like to cast--

01:43:31.845 --> 01:43:33.632
MARISHA: We're all trying some shit, it's okay.

01:43:33.632 --> 01:43:35.181
TRAVIS: Crown of Madness.

01:43:35.181 --> 01:43:37.336
(cheering)

01:43:37.336 --> 01:43:39.764
MATT: All righty, so what's the save on that one?

01:43:39.764 --> 01:43:48.597
TRAVIS: It is wisdom saving throw, I believe, let
me double-check. Yeah, wisdom saving throw.

01:43:48.597 --> 01:43:53.048
MATT: No, that's an eight. I'm pretty sure that
does not hit.

01:43:53.048 --> 01:44:00.333
TRAVIS: So he becomes charmed, and a jagged crown
of iron appears around his head, and madness glows

01:44:00.333 --> 01:44:01.684
in its eye.

01:44:01.684 --> 01:44:03.340
MATT: That's concentration, correct?

01:44:03.340 --> 01:44:04.376
TRAVIS: Yes, it is.

01:44:04.376 --> 01:44:10.607
MATT: I'm putting a concentration circle on you.
All righty, the charmed target must use its action

01:44:10.607 --> 01:44:13.588
before moving each of its turns to make a melee
attack against a creature other than itself you

01:44:13.588 --> 01:44:16.970
mentally choose. So it has to be a melee attack.

01:44:16.970 --> 01:44:21.787
TRAVIS: Oh, melee. Fucking shit, I saw the bows.
Damn the words in this book!

01:44:21.787 --> 01:44:22.927
MATT: That's okay.

01:44:22.927 --> 01:44:25.439
(laughter)

01:44:25.439 --> 01:44:28.386
TRAVIS: But I can make him move towards something,
right?

01:44:28.386 --> 01:44:29.409
MATT: That you can.

01:44:29.409 --> 01:44:33.104
TRAVIS: Okay, good. I'm going to have him climb up
on that roof and attack that other fucking gnoll

01:44:33.104 --> 01:44:34.755
that's up on that son of a bitch.

01:44:34.755 --> 01:44:40.011
MATT: Okay. Since it has to use its action before
its movement, you watch as it looks up at the top

01:44:40.011 --> 01:44:45.976
of the roof, (snarling) and leaps up, climbs,
scampers up to the side, and gets right up into

01:44:45.976 --> 01:44:49.881
base to base with this guy, confusing the other
gnoll, who looks down at it, like it's about to

01:44:49.881 --> 01:44:53.060
help him, and it doesn't seem to notice there's
any sort of threat there, but it can't make an

01:44:53.060 --> 01:44:54.506
attack on this round.

01:44:54.506 --> 01:44:59.149
TRAVIS: That's fair. Can I use my bonus action to
use my Mask of Many Faces to make myself look like

01:44:59.149 --> 01:45:01.341
a gnoll? No, they're taller. They're too tall.

01:45:01.341 --> 01:45:04.765
MATT: Well, they're medium, they're not--

01:45:04.765 --> 01:45:07.009
TRAVIS: Two feet taller, I can only do a foot
taller or shorter.

01:45:07.009 --> 01:45:09.873
MATT: It's cutting it close, you'd look like a
small gnoll.

01:45:09.873 --> 01:45:11.630
TRAVIS: I'd like to do it.

01:45:11.630 --> 01:45:13.029
LAURA: A teeny gnoll.

01:45:13.029 --> 01:45:16.271
MARISHA: He's the runt.

01:45:16.271 --> 01:45:22.096
MATT: You are visible to a number of gnolls in
this courtyard. You don't have any movement to

01:45:22.096 --> 01:45:24.110
back away from that edge, unfortunately.

01:45:24.110 --> 01:45:27.964
TRAVIS: I was hoping to just be-- Because I can't
see that far-- to be right here to hit the only

01:45:27.964 --> 01:45:29.461
guy that could see me on the ground there.

01:45:29.461 --> 01:45:34.342
MATT: Right, but you're right on the corner,
that's how you were able to see him and send him

01:45:34.342 --> 01:45:35.581
this way.

01:45:35.581 --> 01:45:37.123
TRAVIS: The guy on the roof can see me as well?

01:45:37.123 --> 01:45:41.106
MATT: Yeah, they can both see you. Just so you
know. The rest of them probably can't, but you

01:45:41.106 --> 01:45:46.101
transform yourself into a gnoll-like appearance.
All right. Does that end your turn?

01:45:46.101 --> 01:45:47.291
TRAVIS: That is it.

01:45:47.291 --> 01:45:54.477
MATT: All righty. In the back of the alleyway, one
of the gnolls stands thicker, more angry, and more

01:45:54.477 --> 01:46:02.183
ornate than the rest of the pack. You see heavy
scale mail armor across the torso, and a large

01:46:02.183 --> 01:46:09.500
helmet across its head. You look as thick spines
about a foot and a half to two feet long are woven

01:46:09.500 --> 01:46:14.108
into the scales themselves off the shoulders, the
back of the helmet, and the sides of the armor.

01:46:14.108 --> 01:46:22.336
They look natural, as opposed to metal, like long,
bony spines that are put onto it, both as an

01:46:22.336 --> 01:46:30.693
ornate adornment, or possibly just a means of
defense and to look scary. It begins barking and

01:46:30.693 --> 01:46:34.709
steps forward, giving motions to some of the other
gnolls, and the ones that are on the cart continue

01:46:34.709 --> 01:46:36.326
pushing it, as it steps forward--

01:46:36.326 --> 01:46:39.595
LAURA: Oh no.

01:46:39.595 --> 01:46:40.937
MATT: To there.

01:46:40.937 --> 01:46:43.292
TRAVIS: I should have used it on that fucker.

01:46:43.292 --> 01:46:46.502
MATT: It's going to go ahead and use--

01:46:46.502 --> 01:46:48.973
SAM: Is that a crownsguard?

01:46:48.973 --> 01:46:52.507
LAURA: No, he's like a Grandmaster gnoll.

01:46:52.507 --> 01:46:53.891
SAM: No, the guy next to him.

01:46:53.891 --> 01:46:57.902
LAURA: Oh. I feel like that's a zombie gnoll.

01:46:57.902 --> 01:46:59.871
MATT: It's going to use Incite Rampage.

01:46:59.871 --> 01:47:01.791
SAM: Oof, what does that mean?

01:47:01.791 --> 01:47:08.871
MATT: It looks over towards the one that's right
next to Beau and goes, (snarling). The one that's

01:47:08.871 --> 01:47:12.978
in the middle of the area with you hears that,
grins, and then gets an extra attack against you,

01:47:12.978 --> 01:47:21.147
with disadvantage. And a four. That defense is
helping you out. It goes to strike again, and as

01:47:21.147 --> 01:47:24.350
it comes out with its claw, it's putting its spear
to the side.

01:47:24.350 --> 01:47:26.198
MARISHA: I do a little duck.

01:47:26.198 --> 01:47:32.713
MATT: It misses you entirely. That's going to end
its turn at the moment. Then it goes to the guards

01:47:32.713 --> 01:47:35.184
on this end. These guards are going to fan out.

01:47:35.184 --> 01:47:37.426
TRAVIS: (raspy voice) Hey, come on, let's go.

01:47:37.426 --> 01:47:45.888
MATT: Then they dart back around this way. They're
going to find a corner next to you, Jester, and

01:47:45.888 --> 01:47:52.835
take a shot at the gnoll that's up on the roof,
next to the one that you have charmed. Shit,

01:47:52.835 --> 01:47:58.717
that's going to miss. Five plus five. He fires and
it goes wide, you see it vanish into the rising

01:47:58.717 --> 01:48:04.262
cloud of embers and flame. That's going to end the
guards' turn. They're getting around and preparing

01:48:04.262 --> 01:48:05.629
for the next round to shoot a volley.

01:48:05.629 --> 01:48:08.137
LAURA: I pat him on the shoulder and say: don't
worry, nobody saw that.

01:48:08.137 --> 01:48:13.558
MATT: They glance over their shoulder and is like,
"Shh!" Molly, you're up.

01:48:13.558 --> 01:48:21.216
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a run. Am I going to
do this? Am I going to be this idiot? Yeah, let's

01:48:21.216 --> 01:48:27.041
be an idiot. I'm going to take a run to try to get
cover at the other house. I'm going to try to run

01:48:27.041 --> 01:48:27.965
across the alleyway.

01:48:27.965 --> 01:48:28.991
MATT: This way?

01:48:28.991 --> 01:48:29.772
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:48:29.772 --> 01:48:30.760
LAURA: Dashy-dash?

01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:32.035
TALIESIN: Dashy-dash.

01:48:32.035 --> 01:48:38.065
MATT: (counting) It will put you at about there.

01:48:38.065 --> 01:48:39.143
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:48:39.143 --> 01:48:40.304
MATT: But that's your round.

01:48:40.304 --> 01:48:41.812
TALIESIN: That's my round. I just (zooming).

01:48:41.812 --> 01:48:46.696
MATT: Cool. All righty. That ends Molly's turn.
Jester, you're up.

01:48:46.696 --> 01:49:00.884
LAURA: Okie dokie. I'm going to send my duplicate
out against the wall on this house.

01:49:00.884 --> 01:49:02.991
MATT: Over here?

01:49:02.991 --> 01:49:14.860
LAURA: Yeah. Against that wall. She can go up to
30 feet. And I'm going to run across--

01:49:14.860 --> 01:49:16.263
MATT: That space?

01:49:16.263 --> 01:49:22.796
LAURA: Yeah, can I get against the wall further
in? Yeah, right there, that's good.

01:49:22.796 --> 01:49:26.408
MATT: Okay. That's your turn? You still have an
action.

01:49:26.408 --> 01:49:28.693
LAURA: Oh yeah, I'm going to use my bonus
action--

01:49:28.693 --> 01:49:34.334
MATT: You currently cannot see anything for it to
attack. You need to be able to see a target for it

01:49:34.334 --> 01:49:41.186
to attack something. So you'd have to be either
further out. You can do it as part of your

01:49:41.186 --> 01:49:43.786
movement, as you run across, make it move and
attack, and then continue back--

01:49:43.786 --> 01:49:48.480
LAURA: As I'm running, can I use my spiritual
weapon and--

01:49:48.480 --> 01:49:50.167
MATT: Can you move it 20 feet?

01:49:50.167 --> 01:50:00.092
LAURA: I think it's 30 feet. Let's see. 20 feet.
You're right, I'm sorry. 20 feet.

01:50:00.092 --> 01:50:01.778
MATT: Which direction?

01:50:01.778 --> 01:50:06.350
LAURA: Towards the giant guy and hit him!

01:50:06.350 --> 01:50:08.057
MATT: Make a roll.

01:50:08.057 --> 01:50:12.754
LAURA: Hit him with the rock! 15.

01:50:12.754 --> 01:50:15.001
MATT: 15 unfortunately does not hit.

01:50:15.001 --> 01:50:16.456
LAURA: Boo!

01:50:16.456 --> 01:50:25.576
MATT: It just misses, you watch as the shield
comes up and deflects the large glowing mace of a

01:50:25.576 --> 01:50:31.451
lollipop. Then you continue the rest of your
movement to dart behind the building. At this

01:50:31.451 --> 01:50:35.025
point, you've all pretty much shown your cards
that you're here and part of this fight. You're

01:50:35.025 --> 01:50:36.684
the only one who's up in the air.

01:50:36.684 --> 01:50:43.023
LAURA: For my action, can I still see my duplicate
around the corner right there?

01:50:43.023 --> 01:50:44.142
MATT: Correct.

01:50:44.142 --> 01:50:45.492
LAURA: She is going to cast--

01:50:45.492 --> 01:50:48.585
MATT: Well, you would be able to as you're
running.

01:50:48.585 --> 01:50:54.275
LAURA: Okay. She is going to use the cantrip
Sacred Flame!

01:50:54.275 --> 01:50:55.971
MATT: Against?

01:50:55.971 --> 01:50:58.716
LAURA: Against the same big guy!

01:50:58.716 --> 01:51:02.502
MATT: These would be things you would have done before you
ran across.

01:51:02.502 --> 01:51:05.638
LAURA: Yes, basically yes, that's what I did.
Technically I did this before I moved.

01:51:05.638 --> 01:51:13.585
MATT: Just letting you know that usually you have
to do that as part of your movement. Dexterity

01:51:13.585 --> 01:51:17.951
saving throw. That is a 12.

01:51:17.951 --> 01:51:23.689
LAURA: Good! He has to beat 13! It hits him!

01:51:23.689 --> 01:51:25.690
MATT: It takes 1d8 points of radiant damage.

01:51:25.690 --> 01:51:30.199
LAURA: Yes it does! Four.

01:51:30.199 --> 01:51:40.523
MATT: After the shield deflects the lollipop, the
flash of radiant energy burns across the armor and

01:51:40.523 --> 01:51:43.738
the torso. Instinctively it puts up the shield to
try and deflect the blow from the eyes.

01:51:43.738 --> 01:51:51.289
(screeches) Looks out and doesn't see where it
came from, but it's singed a little. That ends

01:51:51.289 --> 01:51:55.083
Jester's turn, Caleb and Nott, you're up.

01:51:55.083 --> 01:51:59.990
LIAM: Yeah okay, I will move along the table over
here to this spot.

01:51:59.990 --> 01:52:02.079
LAURA: Well, that's one method to be able to
reach.

01:52:02.079 --> 01:52:04.358
LIAM: I think I have a clear view of the big gnoll,
correct? From there?

01:52:04.358 --> 01:52:07.561
MATT: The big one? You do.

01:52:07.561 --> 01:52:15.452
LIAM: I mutter a few arcane words under my breath
and a circle of flame spins around my hand and

01:52:15.452 --> 01:52:26.190
three beams of fire shoot out towards this big
guy. I cast Scorching Ray. Each one is a separate

01:52:26.190 --> 01:52:31.644
attack. First one is a 16.

01:52:31.644 --> 01:52:33.261
MATT: 16 hits.

01:52:33.261 --> 01:52:36.328
LIAM: Second one is also a 16, the third one is a
17.

01:52:36.328 --> 01:52:37.715
MATT: All three hit.

01:52:37.715 --> 01:52:39.422
LIAM: So 6d6 on him.

01:52:39.422 --> 01:52:40.927
SAM: 6d6?

01:52:40.927 --> 01:52:44.536
LIAM: Because they all hit. That's four, six--

01:52:44.536 --> 01:52:47.392
TRAVIS: What dice are you rolling there, big guy?

01:52:47.392 --> 01:52:48.994
LIAM: Nine. That's the six?

01:52:48.994 --> 01:52:50.594
TRAVIS: No, your d20, which one was it?

01:52:50.594 --> 01:52:51.777
LIAM: This one.

01:52:51.777 --> 01:52:52.988
LAURA: That's the Grog one.

01:52:52.988 --> 01:53:03.328
LIAM: Oh, thank you. (counting) That's a total of
19 fire damage on him.

01:53:03.328 --> 01:53:10.608
MATT: 19 points of fire damage. As the three beams
arc out and blast, you see as the large gnoll, who

01:53:10.608 --> 01:53:16.664
seems to be a pack lord or leader of some kind,
sees this coming. Tries to put the shield up, but

01:53:16.664 --> 01:53:21.934
all three blast into its armor. You watch as
flames burn out of it suddenly. As it withdraws

01:53:21.934 --> 01:53:30.293
and takes a step back-- (grows and howls) It just
looks angry. It looks hurt a little bit, but

01:53:30.293 --> 01:53:31.263
mostly angry.

01:53:31.263 --> 01:53:35.118
LIAM: I probably have ten feet of movement which I
would like to use to move back to where I was and

01:53:35.118 --> 01:53:37.756
try to not hyperventilate against the back of this
building.

01:53:37.756 --> 01:53:38.988
MATT: Okay.

01:53:38.988 --> 01:53:42.739
LIAM: Dead center. Yeah. Okay. Good.

01:53:42.739 --> 01:53:45.062
MATT: Good to know.

01:53:45.062 --> 01:53:47.603
LAURA: I like that you're facing the wall so it
looks like--

01:53:47.603 --> 01:53:52.765
LIAM: No, I'm like this. I'm doing this.

01:53:52.765 --> 01:53:54.681
MATT: Nott, you're up.

01:53:54.681 --> 01:54:04.327
SAM: Nott's going to poke her head into the window
where Beau is inside. Beau is within a few feet of

01:54:04.327 --> 01:54:21.962
a baddie, right? I'm going to shoot the baddie
next to Beau. 15.

01:54:21.962 --> 01:54:26.748
MATT: 15, that doesn't-- oh wait, for a regular
gnoll that just hits, barely.

01:54:26.748 --> 01:54:28.589
ALL: Regular gnoll!

01:54:28.589 --> 01:54:36.125
(laughter)

01:54:36.125 --> 01:54:39.688
TRAVIS: That's all I heard!

01:54:39.688 --> 01:54:47.885
SAM: Nine points, that's including sneak attack
damage. Plus fury of the small, so 11 points of damage.

01:54:47.885 --> 01:54:51.399
MATT: Well, it's your level, right? You went up a
level so technically--

01:54:51.399 --> 01:54:56.659
SAM: Ten points of-- wait, what did I say? Nine?
12! Thank you.

01:54:56.659 --> 01:55:02.097
MATT: 12 points of damage. As this gnoll is in the
process of slamming through the front doorway, the

01:55:02.097 --> 01:55:06.945
doorway has been bashed inward on each side and
Beau is in the process of dodging and weaving and

01:55:06.945 --> 01:55:10.615
getting out of the way. You find one opening and
fire your crossbow bolt. It goes through the

01:55:10.615 --> 01:55:15.235
window, through the doorway bisecting the two
different rooms and straight under the clavicle

01:55:15.235 --> 01:55:22.233
near the heart section of it. As it pierces in,
(screams) and it coughs up a bunch of blood onto

01:55:22.233 --> 01:55:28.702
the front of its hide armor. It's not dead, but
it's pretty hurt. That was a pretty nasty blow.

01:55:28.702 --> 01:55:39.025
SAM: Movement, I will use to climb up into the
second floor window. That's not me. The one next

01:55:39.025 --> 01:55:40.713
to your right. There you go.

01:55:40.713 --> 01:55:43.158
MATT: Go ahead and make an athletics check.

01:55:43.158 --> 01:55:53.438
SAM: That was good, but it's disadvantage. That's
better. Athletics. It's a straight ten.

01:55:53.438 --> 01:55:57.578
MATT: Ten is exactly what you needed. That was the
DC to get up onto the second floor. As you come up

01:55:57.578 --> 01:56:02.188
into the second floor, you immediately climb and
leap up through the window into a chamber that is

01:56:02.188 --> 01:56:03.826
filled with roaring flame.

01:56:03.826 --> 01:56:05.145
SAM: (screams)

01:56:05.145 --> 01:56:11.217
MATT: Trying to avert your gaze, the heat is
pressing into you. There's a table that's on fire,

01:56:11.217 --> 01:56:16.782
most of the roof has been burned away. There's
beams that have fallen. You're like, "This was a

01:56:16.782 --> 01:56:18.013
"bad idea!"

01:56:18.013 --> 01:56:20.245
SAM: I say: This is fine!

01:56:20.245 --> 01:56:28.964
(laughter)

01:56:28.964 --> 01:56:31.437
SAM: Can I use my dash? Was that all my movement?

01:56:31.437 --> 01:56:35.307
MATT: No, that was your movement to get up there
and you could use your bonus action if you'd like to.

01:56:35.307 --> 01:56:39.167
SAM: Okay, I'll use a bonus action to get-- Is
towards the window less fiery?

01:56:39.167 --> 01:56:43.237
MATT: It's still burning, but you're going to have
to leap over the flames to get there.

01:56:43.237 --> 01:56:45.432
SAM: Sure.

01:56:45.432 --> 01:56:49.636
MATT: I'll say make an acrobatics check to try and
leap over parts of broken--

01:56:49.636 --> 01:56:53.923
SAM: It was two threes.

01:56:53.923 --> 01:57:01.707
MATT: You make it across. You leap onto the first
beam and it breaks. You're like "Ah, that burns!"

01:57:01.707 --> 01:57:06.635
You leap again onto the next one, "Ah, that burns
too!" Eventually, you get over there. Your boots

01:57:06.635 --> 01:57:15.194
are on fire, and you're having to pat them out
real fast. You suffer five points of fire damage

01:57:15.194 --> 01:57:16.950
getting across the room.

01:57:16.950 --> 01:57:18.166
SAM: Rough.

01:57:18.166 --> 01:57:21.658
MATT: But you are in an area where it seems it's
just embers, and most of the flame is catching

01:57:21.658 --> 01:57:26.772
behind you for the moment. You get the sense that
it might begin to spread in the next minute or so,

01:57:26.772 --> 01:57:31.382
but at this point, you're not immediately in the
threat of flame and you have a look down into the

01:57:31.382 --> 01:57:35.463
entirety of the courtyard with a little bit of
cover. In fact, it would be considered half cover

01:57:35.463 --> 01:57:36.686
up in here.

01:57:36.686 --> 01:57:41.946
SAM: Half cover. I'm done. Hey, look at that, it's
me in the window.

01:57:41.946 --> 01:57:51.178
MATT: At which point, you can see the skeletal
gnolls that are out there all at once turn and

01:57:51.178 --> 01:58:00.561
begin shambling forward. There's one this way that
begins to run up and take a swing at your

01:58:00.561 --> 01:58:08.643
duplicitous form, before striking out with no
effect. This one spins and comes up into Beau and

01:58:08.643 --> 01:58:11.355
then there's one that emerges from--

01:58:11.355 --> 01:58:18.473
LAURA: I'm going to point out I've been doing
it wrong because I was thinking of my duplicate as

01:58:18.473 --> 01:58:24.965
like Trinket was, which had movement the same as
me, and it is a bonus action to move my duplicate,

01:58:24.965 --> 01:58:30.725
which I did not realize. I'm going to stop doing
that.

01:58:30.725 --> 01:58:32.959
MATT: That's okay, we learn what the new abilities
do.

01:58:32.959 --> 01:58:34.781
LAURA: Yeah, I just looked it up and I'm sorry.

01:58:34.781 --> 01:58:36.114
MATT: That's all good.

01:58:36.114 --> 01:58:40.649
SAM: So your duplicate is somehow less useful than
Trinket? Is that what you're saying?

01:58:40.649 --> 01:58:46.324
(laughter)

01:58:46.324 --> 01:58:48.575
LIAM: She doesn't give a shit about that bear.

01:58:48.575 --> 01:58:58.681
MATT: Out of the doorway here, another one of them
bursts through and runs to the back and sees the

01:58:58.681 --> 01:59:01.104
direction where Jester is in the process of
glancing over to the side.

01:59:01.104 --> 01:59:02.556
LAURA: Oh! That's real me!

01:59:02.556 --> 01:59:06.444
MATT: It uses its action to charge up into combat
with you. It can't actually make an attack this

01:59:06.444 --> 01:59:12.672
turn, but it's right up to you. Its gaping,
vacuous skull, open sockets, trying to bear down

01:59:12.672 --> 01:59:17.346
on you. That's going to end their go, except for
the one that's striking at you, Beau.

01:59:17.346 --> 01:59:20.877
TALIESIN: There's one on the roof still, too.

01:59:20.877 --> 01:59:29.911
MATT: Well, that's not one of the skeletal ones.
That's going to be, with disadvantage, 17 to hit.

01:59:29.911 --> 01:59:31.574
MARISHA: 17 hits.

01:59:31.574 --> 01:59:37.625
MATT: 17 hit. It bites out towards you with its
broken toothy jaws and you suffer six points of

01:59:37.625 --> 01:59:42.805
piercing damage as the jaws clamp down on your
forearm and you're like "Oh god!" It's pushing now

01:59:42.805 --> 01:59:47.046
to try to find the space next to the larger gnoll
and they're both currently blocking the doorway

01:59:47.046 --> 01:59:48.267
from your escape.

01:59:48.267 --> 01:59:52.315
MARISHA: I'm doing the animal control thing and be
like: No, no, bad.

01:59:52.315 --> 01:59:55.672
MATT: Which, by the way, top of the round. Beau,
your go.

01:59:55.672 --> 02:00:05.769
MARISHA: My go, okay. Let me put these hit points
in. Apply changes.

02:00:05.769 --> 02:00:12.796
LAURA: This makes my duplicate way less fun if I
can't move her.

02:00:12.796 --> 02:00:15.527
TALIESIN: You get bonus actions all the time.

02:00:15.527 --> 02:00:18.288
LAURA: That's my spiritual weapon.

02:00:18.288 --> 02:00:22.799
SAM: She may move if you move away from her 30
feet; she may just come with you.

02:00:22.799 --> 02:00:24.418
LAURA: 120 feet.

02:00:24.418 --> 02:00:28.170
SAM: Oh shit. But you can leave her out in the
open.

02:00:28.170 --> 02:00:30.484
LAURA: Yeah, at least she's directing fire.

02:00:30.484 --> 02:00:40.340
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to do something creative.
I'm going to take the arrow that Nott just fired

02:00:40.387 --> 02:00:46.773
into the guy's chest. I'm going to grab it. Can I
rip it out with my off-hand, spin around, and stab

02:00:46.773 --> 02:00:48.619
him back in the blade?

02:00:48.619 --> 02:00:52.180
MATT: Awesome, go ahead and roll for your main
attack.

02:00:52.180 --> 02:00:59.775
MARISHA: God blessed fuck. That's not good. That's
a ten.

02:00:59.775 --> 02:01:05.494
MATT: You pull it out. There's a horrible pained
yelp as you yank it out. As you spin around and

02:01:05.494 --> 02:01:11.592
attempt to slam it into its back, its giant, thick
gnoll arm slams into the door frame and blocks

02:01:11.592 --> 02:01:15.754
your ability to pass forward. You get caught over
its arm and have to withdraw.

02:01:15.754 --> 02:01:21.482
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to take my other off-hand
attack on the one that just bit down on me. I'm

02:01:21.482 --> 02:01:25.226
going to rip from it and elbow crack it right in
the nose.

02:01:25.226 --> 02:01:27.403
MATT: The one that just bit you? All right, go for
it.

02:01:27.403 --> 02:01:31.173
MARISHA: Damn it. That's 11.

02:01:31.173 --> 02:01:37.202
MATT: 11? 11 doesn't hit unfortunately. Lot of
whiffing on both sides when it comes around Beau,

02:01:37.202 --> 02:01:42.926
but as you attempt to strike out with the elbow,
it does strike its skull, and its jaw unhinges and

02:01:42.926 --> 02:01:45.159
snaps it back into place.

02:01:45.159 --> 02:01:48.313
MARISHA: Shit, that was my bonus action, wasn't
it?

02:01:48.313 --> 02:01:49.417
MATT: Yep.

02:01:49.417 --> 02:01:53.622
MARISHA: I can't use a ki point, can I?

02:01:53.622 --> 02:01:58.738
MATT: As a bonus action, you can use a ki point to
do two as your bonus if you have it. Flurry of Blows.

02:01:58.738 --> 02:02:03.120
MARISHA: I was wanting to do a ki point to do
Patient Defense again.

02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:06.104
MATT: No, you used your bonus action, sorry. You
want to move or you want to stay where you are?

02:02:06.104 --> 02:02:08.633
MARISHA: Yeah, can I back up into the house and
close the door?

02:02:08.633 --> 02:02:13.272
MATT: The door frame is pretty banged up, you can
try. You can certainly try.

02:02:13.272 --> 02:02:14.739
MARISHA: Sure!

02:02:14.739 --> 02:02:22.928
MATT: Taking a step back, one has spears, so
you're still in its melee range as you try and

02:02:22.928 --> 02:02:25.725
close the door. They'll both get attacks of
opportunity on you if you do that.

02:02:25.725 --> 02:02:27.047
MARISHA: No, I'll stay.

02:02:27.047 --> 02:02:30.898
MATT: Okay, so you stay there holding your
position. That ends Beau's turn. The gnolls go.

02:02:30.898 --> 02:02:36.911
Before we do anything, the one that's right next
to the guy on the wall, what do you want it to do?

02:02:36.911 --> 02:02:43.086
TRAVIS: Melee, so if he has a weapon or anything,
hit him. If not, just knock him the fuck off the roof.

02:02:43.086 --> 02:02:45.125
MATT: He has a spear or you can make a shove, up
to you.

02:02:45.125 --> 02:02:46.360
TRAVIS: Spear!

02:02:46.360 --> 02:02:52.601
MATT: All right, so the spear attack, it's going
to, as it climbs to the top and lunges out with

02:02:52.601 --> 02:02:55.109
its arm. Go ahead and make an attack roll for me.

02:02:55.109 --> 02:02:57.483
TRAVIS: Oh, okay. Plus anything?

02:02:57.483 --> 02:02:59.119
MATT: It is plus five.

02:02:59.119 --> 02:03:00.233
TRAVIS: That's a 20.

02:03:00.233 --> 02:03:01.147
MATT: Sorry, plus four.

02:03:01.147 --> 02:03:02.153
TRAVIS: That's a 19.

02:03:02.153 --> 02:03:11.361
MATT: 19 definitely hits. Go ahead and roll 1d6
damage plus two. Two hands technically, so that

02:03:11.361 --> 02:03:12.884
would be 1d8. Sorry.

02:03:12.884 --> 02:03:15.943
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's much better. Nine.

02:03:15.943 --> 02:03:28.413
MATT: Nine. Nein! It jams the spear with both hands into
its friend and the gnoll yelps and grabs it and

02:03:28.413 --> 02:03:34.357
pulls it out and looks at it confused and angry.
Trying to figure out what exactly happened. As it

02:03:34.357 --> 02:03:42.596
does so, it's going to attempt to shove it off the
wall that just hit it. Make a roll for the

02:03:42.596 --> 02:03:44.747
athletics check of the other gnoll.

02:03:44.747 --> 02:03:46.611
TRAVIS: Adding my modifier or its?

02:03:46.611 --> 02:03:47.731
MATT: Its modifier.

02:03:47.731 --> 02:03:48.856
TRAVIS: 16 plus?

02:03:48.856 --> 02:03:55.544
MATT: 16 plus two. It beat it. It rolled a 17.
After it gets stabbed and looks back at the gnoll

02:03:55.544 --> 02:04:02.502
that you took control and Sparta-kicks it off of
the edge of the roof. It slides and tumbles down,

02:04:02.502 --> 02:04:14.986
landing onto the ground prone right next to Molly.
It does suffer one point of falling damage. Molly,

02:04:14.986 --> 02:04:19.021
you watch as it tumbles and hits the dirt next to
you and it's like (groans). You watch as this

02:04:19.021 --> 02:04:22.616
mystical crown of weird iron horns are floating
above its head.

02:04:22.616 --> 02:04:25.398
TALIESIN: Is this--?

02:04:25.398 --> 02:04:40.437
MATT: That takes up his turn. This guy's going to
move forward and advance. This is unfortunate for

02:04:40.437 --> 02:04:46.042
Beau, partially. This one is going to fire at
Beau. This one actually can see Nott and this one

02:04:46.042 --> 02:04:54.097
is going to take a shot at Nott as well. So one
attack against you, Beau, from that gnoll there.

02:04:54.097 --> 02:05:00.301
That's going to be 11, misses. It actually hits
the wall and embeds itself into the side of the

02:05:00.301 --> 02:05:06.671
door frame. The two attacking you, Nott-- You do
have partial cover on these guys. Half cover will

02:05:06.671 --> 02:05:12.938
be plus two bonus to AC. The first one is going to be a
20.

02:05:12.938 --> 02:05:14.154
SAM: Hits.

02:05:14.154 --> 02:05:24.574
MATT: The second one is a natural two. The one
that does hit you, you suffer nine points of

02:05:24.574 --> 02:05:32.095
piercing damage. A lot of nines tonight! As the
arrow suddenly arcs upward and hits you right in

02:05:32.095 --> 02:05:36.957
the side of the jaw and carves through part of
your neck that way before it exits out the other

02:05:36.957 --> 02:05:40.587
side. You have this big gash on the side. It
doesn't quite hit the jugular, thankfully, but it

02:05:40.587 --> 02:05:42.914
is pretty messy as you are starting to bleed down
the side of your neck.

02:05:42.914 --> 02:05:44.840
LAURA: Isn't she harder to hit because she's so
little?

02:05:44.840 --> 02:05:58.153
MATT: Yeah, but that one had some decent aim.
These guys here continue to push forward that way

02:05:58.153 --> 02:06:02.161
and they're going to use their other action to
push forward. This guy is going to go ahead and

02:06:02.161 --> 02:06:06.478
throw another body up onto this as the other one's
pushing it. They don't get quite as far because

02:06:06.478 --> 02:06:10.120
one of them stopped pushing, but they're getting
to the edge of the map. The one that's snarling

02:06:10.120 --> 02:06:24.920
there is watching them vanish behind. This guy
around the edge is going to, let's see. Seeing you

02:06:24.920 --> 02:06:29.348
yelp up in the window, he's going to take a shot
at you. Beau's currently being dealt with two of

02:06:29.348 --> 02:06:36.209
them and you're up in the flames right now. That
is going to be a 15, which I do not believe hits.

02:06:36.209 --> 02:06:37.261
SAM: No.

02:06:37.261 --> 02:06:41.159
MATT: This one strikes the ember wood on the
outside and breaks through, but it only comes

02:06:41.159 --> 02:06:50.229
partially out and is embedded, missing you by an
inch. That finishes the gnolls' turn, I believe.

02:06:50.229 --> 02:06:59.872
Oh, this guy is going to turn and take a swing at
Beau with a spear, two hands. That is a 16.

02:06:59.872 --> 02:07:01.218
MARISHA: Miss.

02:07:01.218 --> 02:07:06.261
MATT: 16 misses. It swings out and you actually
catch the spear off to the side and you're now in

02:07:06.261 --> 02:07:08.592
a strength tug of war with its own weapon as
it's--

02:07:08.592 --> 02:07:17.982
MARISHA: My stick! Mine! Drop it! Bad! Do you want
to play or not?

02:07:17.982 --> 02:07:22.359
MATT: Ending their go, it goes to Fjord's turn.

02:07:22.359 --> 02:07:28.399
TRAVIS: Crown of Madness piece of shit. Can I go
ahead and send, using my action to maintain it,

02:07:28.399 --> 02:07:31.679
can I send that stupid ass back up the roof?

02:07:31.679 --> 02:07:35.857
MATT: Let me double-check something.

02:07:35.857 --> 02:07:37.979
TALIESIN: The damage may have--

02:07:37.979 --> 02:07:39.732
TRAVIS: Knocked it out. No!

02:07:39.732 --> 02:07:49.423
MATT: I don't know if that's the case. It's not
just that. It already moved on its turn, it takes

02:07:49.423 --> 02:07:53.032
its turn, you have to spend your action to maintain
the spell, so it won't do anything on your turn.

02:07:53.032 --> 02:07:57.833
So either you continue to maintain the spell, and
then next turn it's still under your control, or

02:07:57.884 --> 02:07:59.380
you do whatever you want--

02:07:59.380 --> 02:08:02.876
LAURA: Or you drop it because he's prone and Molly
will get super advantage on hitting him.

02:08:02.876 --> 02:08:04.462
SAM: Super advantage!

02:08:04.462 --> 02:08:06.781
TALIESIN: Yeah, I don't know what the crown is.

02:08:06.781 --> 02:08:16.693
TRAVIS: Fuck it, I'll drop it and I'll come into
the street, down the way 30 feet. But I look like

02:08:16.693 --> 02:08:18.144
a gnoll.

02:08:18.144 --> 02:08:22.514
TALIESIN: Concentration's gone.

02:08:22.514 --> 02:08:26.313
MATT: Oh, that's right. Thank you.

02:08:26.313 --> 02:08:28.957
TRAVIS: But I still look like a gnoll.

02:08:28.957 --> 02:08:30.324
MATT: Yes, you do.

02:08:30.324 --> 02:08:33.600
TRAVIS: That will be my turn.

02:08:33.600 --> 02:08:36.867
MATT: All righty, are you holding your action to
do anything?

02:08:36.867 --> 02:08:43.736
TRAVIS: I guess, because I dropped it, I have it.

02:08:43.736 --> 02:08:45.814
MATT: You have your action because you didn't
maintain the spell.

02:08:45.814 --> 02:08:53.357
TRAVIS: With my action, I'm going to cast
Hexblade's Curse on that big son of a bitch.

02:08:53.357 --> 02:08:54.431
MATT: This guy?

02:08:54.431 --> 02:08:55.464
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:08:55.464 --> 02:08:57.177
MATT: I believe it's a bonus action to do that,
isn't it?

02:08:57.177 --> 02:08:58.144
TRAVIS: It is.

02:08:58.144 --> 02:08:59.786
MATT: So you still have your action.

02:08:59.786 --> 02:09:04.292
TALIESIN: You could even make it to get into his
face.

02:09:04.292 --> 02:09:17.833
TRAVIS: With my action, I will Eldritch Blast from
where I am.

02:09:17.833 --> 02:09:19.859
MATT: Go for it, make the attack roll.

02:09:19.859 --> 02:09:25.137
TRAVIS: Thank you. Skadoosh. It's a 15 plus six,
21.

02:09:25.137 --> 02:09:26.884
MATT: That hits, go ahead and roll damage.

02:09:26.884 --> 02:09:43.632
TRAVIS: Amazing, 1d10. (counting) Sorry, I
should've looked at this beforehand. 14.

02:09:43.632 --> 02:09:50.528
MATT: 14 points of damage. As you rush up, you
watch as this squatter gnoll saunters out in the

02:09:50.528 --> 02:09:56.864
middle, points to the seeming leader of this
cluster, and as it does, the soot and ash from the

02:09:56.864 --> 02:10:01.470
ground begins to affix itself around the inside of
its armor, holding it in place for the moment.

02:10:01.470 --> 02:10:09.814
With the other hand holding the suddenly
appearing barnacle-studded blade, you unleash

02:10:09.814 --> 02:10:15.427
this blast of eldritch energy that slams into the
center of the armor. You watch as the energy

02:10:15.427 --> 02:10:20.833
courses through all of the crevices between the
scales that are overlapping. As it fades, you

02:10:20.833 --> 02:10:26.088
watch as this bit of steam and blood come out of
its mouth, and it turns right to you, its head

02:10:26.088 --> 02:10:29.994
turning, it spits a cluster.

02:10:29.994 --> 02:10:31.809
TRAVIS: (yipping)

02:10:31.809 --> 02:10:33.454
MATT: We'll get to that. That's your turn?

02:10:33.454 --> 02:10:34.442
TRAVIS: That's it.

02:10:34.442 --> 02:10:37.680
MATT: Okay, it's his turn now. Now it-- (shrieks
and growls)

02:10:37.680 --> 02:10:40.362
(laughter)

02:10:40.362 --> 02:10:48.267
MATT: And goes running and rushes up towards you.
You watch as previously it just had this large

02:10:48.267 --> 02:10:54.828
pole on its back? It pulls it and brings it loose
as you see a large two-handed glaive come swooping,

02:10:54.828 --> 02:10:59.333
which doesn't actually-- it can get to there and
still hit you because of its reach. As it runs

02:10:59.333 --> 02:11:02.181
forward, it brings it down. It's going to
multi-attack you twice with it.

02:11:02.181 --> 02:11:03.334
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:11:03.334 --> 02:11:07.601
MATT: First one is going to be a 21 to hit?

02:11:07.601 --> 02:11:08.803
TRAVIS: Oh, that'll hit.

02:11:08.803 --> 02:11:11.352
MATT: And a 17 to hit.

02:11:11.352 --> 02:11:12.224
TRAVIS: Both hit.

02:11:12.224 --> 02:11:13.608
MATT: Both hit. All right.

02:11:13.608 --> 02:11:17.056
TRAVIS: That's okay, I've got the armor. It deals
damage when you hit me.

02:11:17.056 --> 02:11:18.393
LIAM and LAURA: Ooh.

02:11:18.393 --> 02:11:24.311
MATT: That is eight points of slashing damage on
the first hit. Wham! As the large polearm-- the

02:11:24.311 --> 02:11:28.311
axe-like hooked blade at the end of it. You can
see the same spines that are on its armor are

02:11:28.311 --> 02:11:31.790
affixed to the edge of it. As it slams down
towards you, the armor bursts, this cold energy

02:11:31.790 --> 02:11:33.184
that-- how much damage does he take?

02:11:33.184 --> 02:11:38.432
TRAVIS: I got ten temporary hit points at
second level, so he takes eight points of cold damage.

02:11:38.432 --> 02:11:45.721
MATT: Slick. Second strike? He rolled a one. That
is going to be four points of slashing damage for

02:11:45.721 --> 02:11:46.942
the second strike.

02:11:46.942 --> 02:11:49.533
TRAVIS: So he'll take two points of cold damage
and I'll take the other two points.

02:11:49.533 --> 02:11:50.732
MATT: Nice.

02:11:50.732 --> 02:11:55.041
MARISHA: You have so many fun gadgets!

02:11:55.041 --> 02:12:01.544
MATT: Oh! He does get back his Incite Rampage. At
which point, he's going to go ahead and glance

02:12:01.544 --> 02:12:10.743
over towards the gnoll that is-- hmm.

02:12:10.743 --> 02:12:11.963
SAM: The grassy gnoll?

02:12:11.963 --> 02:12:13.347
MATT: The grassy gnoll, yes. Thank you, Sam.

02:12:13.347 --> 02:12:15.751
TRAVIS: Thank you, Sam.

02:12:15.751 --> 02:12:21.460
MATT: All right, yeah. The only one that they can
currently see that's in melee range at the moment,

02:12:21.460 --> 02:12:23.513
because the wall's there, is going to be the one
next to Beau.

02:12:23.513 --> 02:12:26.797
SAM: No, really. Thank you, Sam.

02:12:26.797 --> 02:12:36.995
MATT: Sincerely. So after it strikes you twice
with the glaive, bits of ice shards spray off with

02:12:36.995 --> 02:12:41.526
each blow now affixing to the ash and the energy
that's instilled this armor after you blasted it.

02:12:41.526 --> 02:12:47.308
It looks over to the one right in front of Beau
and goes (growls and snarls) and it glances over

02:12:47.308 --> 02:12:51.768
its shoulder, and with renewed strength, pulls the
spear free from your grasp and goes for another

02:12:51.768 --> 02:12:53.205
strike against you as a reaction.

02:12:53.205 --> 02:12:54.323
MARISHA: Bad dog.

02:12:54.323 --> 02:12:56.367
MATT: That is going to be a 19 to hit.

02:12:56.367 --> 02:12:58.506
MARISHA: How much?

02:12:58.506 --> 02:12:59.408
MATT: 19.

02:12:59.408 --> 02:13:00.446
MARISHA: That one hits.

02:13:00.446 --> 02:13:02.136
SAM: How many are engaged with you right now?

02:13:02.136 --> 02:13:03.089
MATT: Two.

02:13:03.089 --> 02:13:04.029
MARISHA: Three? Two?

02:13:04.029 --> 02:13:05.025
LAURA: She's so wanted.

02:13:05.025 --> 02:13:09.138
MATT: That's going to be seven points of piercing
damage.

02:13:09.138 --> 02:13:11.275
LIAM: Apologies to my friend.

02:13:11.275 --> 02:13:18.211
MATT: All righty, that's going to end his turn and
the guards back here are going to come forward and--

02:13:18.211 --> 02:13:19.929
TRAVIS: Oh, let's go this way!

02:13:19.929 --> 02:13:23.626
MATT: They're both going to fire at the one on the
rooftop.

02:13:23.626 --> 02:13:25.159
SAM, TRAVIS, and TALIESIN: Hey!

02:13:25.159 --> 02:13:28.945
LAURA: (laughter) And a miss and a miss!

02:13:28.945 --> 02:13:33.249
MATT: First one's a miss. Second one is a 16. That
hits.

02:13:33.249 --> 02:13:34.699
SAM: Hey!

02:13:34.699 --> 02:13:41.179
MATT: It's an eight plus two so that's ten points
of damage. Based on the Crown of Madness damage it

02:13:41.179 --> 02:13:45.884
took earlier, the spear's enough to finish it
off. You watch as on the top, it goes and draws an

02:13:45.943 --> 02:13:50.888
arrow and pulls it back, looking down at you as
you're down in the square. Then one of the guards

02:13:50.888 --> 02:13:57.598
pulls its crossbow and (shrieks) it stumbles back
and falls dead on the ground.

02:13:57.598 --> 02:13:59.320
TRAVIS: Here we go.

02:13:59.320 --> 02:14:05.660
MATT: That ends that one, the other guard over
there. They're going to go ahead and move up the

02:14:05.660 --> 02:14:10.064
side and step out now that it seems to be opening
and is going to fire towards the skeletal gnoll

02:14:10.064 --> 02:14:13.936
that is currently in the process of harassing the
image that as far as they're concerned is just

02:14:13.936 --> 02:14:22.283
Jester. It's going to be-- yeah, that hits.
Without issue.

02:14:22.283 --> 02:14:25.640
TALIESIN: I'm not used to melee combat. This is so
terrifying.

02:14:25.640 --> 02:14:26.656
LAURA: Yeah, right?

02:14:26.656 --> 02:14:27.653
TRAVIS: Get up in that.

02:14:27.653 --> 02:14:28.526
TALIESIN: I don't want to get up in that.

02:14:28.526 --> 02:14:30.063
TRAVIS: Get a whole bunch of stank right in your
face.

02:14:30.063 --> 02:14:34.954
MATT: Pulls out the heavy crossbow and fires and
does 11 points of damage, which is enough to

02:14:34.954 --> 02:14:42.392
shatter the skeletal gnoll witherling. As it falls
to the ground and breaks into a scattered pile of

02:14:42.392 --> 02:14:48.043
bone bits and dried gnoll flesh. That ends the
guards' turn. Molly, you're up.

02:14:48.043 --> 02:14:53.383
TALIESIN: I'm going to stab this thing that just
fell right in front of me. Just going to stab it.

02:14:53.383 --> 02:14:58.537
MATT: It is prone, so I believe you have advantage
against it. Yep! With each attack.

02:14:58.537 --> 02:15:04.134
TALIESIN: Question about Rite of the Dawn, is it
just plus three or is it just my wisdom or is it

02:15:04.134 --> 02:15:05.142
also a--?

02:15:05.142 --> 02:15:07.579
MATT: Wisdom bonus is against undead creatures.

02:15:07.579 --> 02:15:09.164
TALIESIN: Okay, this is not an undead creature.

02:15:09.164 --> 02:15:13.801
MATT: It is not. There are undead creatures
among the pack, but there are none there. It's just

02:15:13.862 --> 02:15:15.336
straight Rite damage.

02:15:15.336 --> 02:15:20.687
TALIESIN: So it's just an extra 1d4. Okay,
just checking. That's how that works. Okay, cool.

02:15:20.687 --> 02:15:24.686
See if I hit? Thank you. 13?

02:15:24.686 --> 02:15:27.069
MATT: 13 unfortunately misses. The first strike--

02:15:27.069 --> 02:15:28.088
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

02:15:28.088 --> 02:15:31.913
MATT: As you swing down onto the ground, it
scrambles about and pulls its shield up just in

02:15:31.913 --> 02:15:37.135
time. Your blade catches the edge, embeds itself
an inch into its rear.

02:15:37.228 --> 02:15:38.953
TALIESIN: I hit it with the other one.

02:15:38.953 --> 02:15:42.345
MATT: You use your one blade to push the shield
off to the side as it's still there, and trying to

02:15:42.345 --> 02:15:44.356
jam downward. Go for it.

02:15:44.356 --> 02:15:45.742
TRAVIS: Definitely hit.

02:15:45.742 --> 02:15:48.890
TALIESIN: Come on. Oh, thank God. 21.

02:15:48.890 --> 02:15:50.465
MATT: 21 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

02:15:50.465 --> 02:15:53.507
TRAVIS: (chanting) Level three! Level three!

02:15:53.507 --> 02:16:00.063
TALIESIN: So that's nine points of damage.

02:16:00.063 --> 02:16:07.260
MATT: Nine points of damage. You manage to jam
underneath and hit it in the chest. It shrieks with pain

02:16:07.260 --> 02:16:13.775
and pushes the blade out of its body with a sheer
flexing of its muscle. It begins to try and get up

02:16:13.922 --> 02:16:18.996
off the ground. It's hurt, but it's still standing or about
to be standing in a moment. You can move if you'd

02:16:18.996 --> 02:16:20.574
like to.

02:16:20.574 --> 02:16:23.452
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's right. I can break combat
with it. It doesn't matter, right? At this point?

02:16:23.452 --> 02:16:24.963
Or does it get an attack of opportunity?

02:16:24.963 --> 02:16:26.947
MATT: It does get an attack of opportunity, but it
has disadvantage on him.

02:16:26.947 --> 02:16:34.627
TALIESIN: There's no way I can circle up onto the
wall, is there?

02:16:34.627 --> 02:16:36.079
MATT: Onto the wall?

02:16:36.079 --> 02:16:38.157
TALIESIN: Yeah. Get a little vantage on him.

02:16:38.157 --> 02:16:39.640
MATT: You could.

02:16:39.640 --> 02:16:43.136
TALIESIN: I want to be able to hop on because I want to
head that direction afterwards. All right.

02:16:43.136 --> 02:16:44.883
MATT: You get up onto the wall.

02:16:44.883 --> 02:16:47.420
TALIESIN: And that way, if he tries to run or do
anything, I can futz with him.

02:16:47.420 --> 02:16:49.890
MATT: Cool, that's fine. Molly, your turn is over.
Jester, you're up.

02:16:49.890 --> 02:16:57.348
LAURA: Yay! I'm going to run away from this guy
that's next to me. I'm going to run out into the

02:16:57.348 --> 02:16:58.836
alley so I can see people.

02:16:58.836 --> 02:16:59.628
MATT: This way?

02:16:59.628 --> 02:17:00.416
LAURA: Yeah.

02:17:00.416 --> 02:17:03.935
MATT: As you rush out, it takes a swing attack of
opportunity towards you. This is going to be with

02:17:03.935 --> 02:17:11.609
a club. It has a heavy wooden club and it makes a
giant arc towards you as you speed away. That is

02:17:11.609 --> 02:17:13.331
19 to hit.

02:17:13.331 --> 02:17:14.723
LAURA: Can I use a reaction on that?

02:17:14.723 --> 02:17:15.942
MATT: You can, yeah.

02:17:15.942 --> 02:17:25.846
LAURA: I'm going to say "I am rubber and you are
glue" and use Hellish Rebuke on him. In Infernal.

02:17:25.846 --> 02:17:31.029
MATT: All right. Well, first, the club hits you
and you take five points of bludgeoning damage.

02:17:31.029 --> 02:17:32.072
LAURA: Okay.

02:17:32.072 --> 02:17:37.261
MATT: As you turn around, you say that at him and
unleash your Hellish Rebuke. He has to make a

02:17:37.261 --> 02:17:38.769
constitution saving throw, I believe it is,
right?

02:17:38.769 --> 02:17:41.324
LAURA: Maybe. Hold on.

02:17:41.324 --> 02:17:42.660
SAM: You have to save first.

02:17:42.660 --> 02:17:45.320
LAURA: I'm applying my changes to my health.

02:17:45.320 --> 02:17:47.984
SAM: Now close out of that.

02:17:47.984 --> 02:17:49.091
LAURA: This is so much!

02:17:49.091 --> 02:17:53.380
MATT: It has to make a constitution save-- No,
that's dexterity saving throw, which it does not

02:17:53.380 --> 02:18:00.786
make. It's seven. So it suffers 2d10 cold damage. So how
much did you deal?

02:18:00.786 --> 02:18:06.799
LAURA: Oh, 2d10. Okay. Nine.

02:18:06.799 --> 02:18:09.254
ALL: Nine.

02:18:09.254 --> 02:18:10.986
TALIESIN: This is becoming a thing.

02:18:10.986 --> 02:18:16.218
LIAM: So sorry, guys. There you go.

02:18:16.218 --> 02:18:24.001
MATT: As you dart away, you release your fury and
anger, and you watch as suddenly this blast of cold

02:18:24.001 --> 02:18:31.970
water and ice energy burst out of its body. The
inside of its somewhat cavernous ribcage is now

02:18:31.970 --> 02:18:35.616
filled with frost crystals, jutting out and
breaking parts of the ribs. It looks heavily

02:18:35.616 --> 02:18:37.433
damaged, but still standing.

02:18:37.433 --> 02:18:39.699
LAURA: Ooh, chilly!

02:18:39.699 --> 02:18:43.052
MATT: All righty.

02:18:43.052 --> 02:18:44.868
SAM: You still have your action, right?

02:18:44.925 --> 02:18:46.262
LAURA: I know, and my bonus action!

02:18:46.262 --> 02:18:47.189
MATT: Yeah.

02:18:47.189 --> 02:18:51.297
LAURA: So for my bonus action, I'm going to send
my lollipop towards the giant guy and try to hit

02:18:51.297 --> 02:19:03.786
him. At the same time, I'm going to cast-- What am
I going to cast? Radiant-- No, Guiding Bolt!

02:19:03.786 --> 02:19:05.424
MATT: Okay.

02:19:05.424 --> 02:19:09.164
LAURA: With, you know, I'm going to do a little
flourish, like pink energy comes out.

02:19:09.164 --> 02:19:11.876
MATT: All right. Go ahead and make your spell attack.

02:19:11.876 --> 02:19:17.921
LAURA: Okay. Spell attack? Ooh, that's good.
That's a 19 plus five.

02:19:17.921 --> 02:19:19.884
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

02:19:19.884 --> 02:19:20.934
LAURA: Okay.

02:19:20.934 --> 02:19:22.070
TALIESIN: That's new dice, man.

02:19:22.070 --> 02:19:22.908
LAURA: Yes, yes, yes.

02:19:22.908 --> 02:19:24.104
SAM: I touched one.

02:19:24.104 --> 02:19:25.672
LAURA: You didn't touch these ones.

02:19:25.672 --> 02:19:27.200
SAM: That's why they rolled so shit.

02:19:27.200 --> 02:19:29.983
LAURA: Six, eight, nine radiant.

02:19:29.983 --> 02:19:31.639
ALL: Nine!

02:19:31.639 --> 02:19:34.222
MATT: What's up with the nines? It's getting
ridiculous.

02:19:34.222 --> 02:19:35.741
TRAVIS: CritRoleStats is going-- (clicking).

02:19:35.741 --> 02:19:37.103
MATT: Yep.

02:19:37.103 --> 02:19:38.370
LIAM: We're losing subscribers in Europe
right now.

02:19:38.370 --> 02:19:43.930
LAURA: That's radiant damage, and then the
Spiritual Weapon--

02:19:43.930 --> 02:19:47.817
MATT: All right. Guiding Bolt: the next attack
against it has advantage.

02:19:47.817 --> 02:19:50.889
LAURA: Oh, good. Then the Spiritual Weapon will
have advantage. Great!

02:19:50.889 --> 02:19:52.577
LIAM: Halt den Mund!

02:19:52.577 --> 02:19:55.151
LAURA: Oh, good. So that's 20.

02:19:55.151 --> 02:19:57.289
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage for Spiritual
Weapon.

02:19:57.289 --> 02:19:58.406
TRAVIS: Nice!

02:19:58.406 --> 02:20:03.663
LAURA: Where's my eight? Six plus three is nine!

02:20:03.663 --> 02:20:06.086
ALL: Nine!

02:20:06.086 --> 02:20:14.891
MATT: This is absurd, guys. This is absurd. All
righty, does that end your turn?

02:20:14.891 --> 02:20:19.175
LAURA: Oh, I'm going to use the rest of my
movement to run over and try to get behind this wall.

02:20:19.175 --> 02:20:24.830
MATT: You're from over there, that's (counting)
20, you have ten more feet. You can get there.

02:20:24.830 --> 02:20:28.421
LAURA: That'll work. I was going to go to the
brick wall.

02:20:28.421 --> 02:20:30.592
MATT: Oh, the brick wall. You'll get up onto it.

02:20:30.592 --> 02:20:32.142
LAURA: Yeah, sure, why not?

02:20:32.142 --> 02:20:35.071
MATT: It's considered rough terrain, so you
technically can't get all the way on the other

02:20:35.071 --> 02:20:40.086
side. You climb up onto it. That finishes your
turn. As you finish blasting with the Guiding

02:20:40.086 --> 02:20:45.335
Bolt, at the same time as it slams and sparkles
you watch as the lollipop clubs down onto the

02:20:45.335 --> 02:20:50.893
back of its head. That ends your turn. Caleb,
Nott, you're up.

02:20:50.893 --> 02:20:57.466
LIAM: Okay. I start moving back towards the same
vantage point I had before and I see Jester above

02:20:57.466 --> 02:21:01.736
me, and I see a guy over there covered in ice, and
I whip around and the diamond comes up and I go

02:21:01.736 --> 02:21:07.914
(sizzling) and I was about to make it acid, but
there's ice everywhere so it's ice now. Chromatic

02:21:07.914 --> 02:21:11.383
Orb off to the big guy in the middle of town
square, yeah.

02:21:11.383 --> 02:21:13.679
MATT: Go ahead and make the attack roll.

02:21:13.679 --> 02:21:15.588
LIAM: It misses entirely.

02:21:15.588 --> 02:21:22.504
MATT: It spins and hits the ground. You watch as
ice crawls up the side of the building. I will say

02:21:22.504 --> 02:21:27.722
it does manage to put out part of the fire that is
currently burning the building.

02:21:27.722 --> 02:21:29.994
MARISHA: You did a good thing here. You did good
today.

02:21:29.994 --> 02:21:36.661
TALIESIN: You made lemonade. Way to make some
lemonade.

02:21:36.661 --> 02:21:39.916
MARISHA: You just got the participation trophy.

02:21:39.916 --> 02:21:44.249
LIAM: Then I use the rest of my movement to press
my back against the wall and go nein, nein, nein.

02:21:44.249 --> 02:21:48.174
MATT: As you move out, where are you at now?

02:21:48.174 --> 02:21:49.960
LIAM: Still behind the same building.

02:21:49.960 --> 02:21:57.503
MATT: You dart out and fire, and then back. All
righty. That ends your turn. Nott!

02:21:57.503 --> 02:22:04.864
SAM: Just a little perspective here. The gnolls
pushing away the cart, how many are there? And

02:22:04.864 --> 02:22:06.317
what are they--?

02:22:06.317 --> 02:22:10.873
MATT: There are currently three that are gathered
around it and in the process of pushing it.

02:22:10.873 --> 02:22:12.901
They're getting momentum as it's going.

02:22:12.901 --> 02:22:16.947
SAM: No obvious weak points on the cart or
anything?

02:22:16.947 --> 02:22:20.894
MATT: Make a perception check. It will take your
bonus action to do so.

02:22:20.894 --> 02:22:22.075
MARISHA: Take out a wheel!

02:22:22.075 --> 02:22:24.941
SAM: It's going to take my bonus action to do so?
Then I will not look at the cart.

02:22:24.941 --> 02:22:27.604
TALIESIN: It will move slower if we kill them.

02:22:27.604 --> 02:22:35.894
SAM: I'm sure it will, but I don't know if I could
kill one in one shot. Instead I will, using my

02:22:35.894 --> 02:22:45.029
goblin feet claws, just dig in and I'm going to go
upside down so I can see into where Beau is and

02:22:45.029 --> 02:22:47.955
shoot one of the ones next to her.

02:22:47.955 --> 02:22:49.116
LAURA: You can do that?!

02:22:49.116 --> 02:22:50.117
SAM: I don't know!

02:22:50.117 --> 02:22:56.361
MATT: As you dig in and hang down, you watch as
your hood and hair hangs upside down. You pull the

02:22:56.361 --> 02:23:00.650
crossbow down. The tension of the bolt is holding
it in, thankfully, otherwise it would just fall

02:23:00.650 --> 02:23:04.490
from its upside down standpoint, and you
fire! You can go ahead and make a strike.

02:23:04.490 --> 02:23:12.993
Technically you have two that you're in view of
here, they both have three-quarters cover because

02:23:12.993 --> 02:23:14.752
of the nearby door and the angle.

02:23:14.752 --> 02:23:15.715
SAM: The ones next to her?

02:23:15.715 --> 02:23:17.229
MATT: Yeah.

02:23:17.229 --> 02:23:18.917
SAM: Ugh. Well, I got to hit them.

02:23:18.917 --> 02:23:20.622
MATT: Which one are you shooting? The skeletal one
or the--?

02:23:20.622 --> 02:23:23.291
SAM: The one that I hit before.

02:23:23.291 --> 02:23:24.926
MATT: Okay, so that one. Go for it.

02:23:24.926 --> 02:23:29.555
SAM: That is 17.

02:23:29.555 --> 02:23:31.460
MARISHA: I think that hits, right?

02:23:31.460 --> 02:23:34.480
MATT: 17 would hit if it didn't have
three-quarters cover, which gives a plus five bonus

02:23:34.480 --> 02:23:35.388
to AC.

02:23:35.388 --> 02:23:36.848
MARISHA: Oh, poopers!

02:23:36.909 --> 02:23:40.272
MATT: Unfortunately, it's just the large part of
the door frame in the way, there's Beau in the

02:23:40.272 --> 02:23:44.765
way, and there's a lot going on in that moment. As
you go and fire it just zips past and slams into

02:23:44.765 --> 02:23:47.044
part of the now broken door that's coming off the
hinges.

02:23:47.044 --> 02:23:50.131
TALIESIN: Man, I hate level three.

02:23:50.131 --> 02:23:55.956
SAM: Cool. I'm going to go pop back up to the top
floor, and use my bonus action to hide.

02:23:55.956 --> 02:23:58.307
MATT: All righty. Go ahead and make a stealth
check.

02:23:58.307 --> 02:24:03.078
SAM: Nope. Ten.

02:24:03.078 --> 02:24:10.689
MATT: You get down low, but your hood and hair are
now frizzed and poking out the side. That ends

02:24:10.689 --> 02:24:19.869
your turn, Nott. This one is going to rush
forward, pursuing Jester. That one is going to

02:24:19.869 --> 02:24:26.652
attempt to continue to whale on Beau. That's going
to be a 15 against Beau.

02:24:26.652 --> 02:24:27.569
MARISHA: Miss.

02:24:27.569 --> 02:24:31.364
MATT: Misses, you just duck out of the way as it
tries to bite you and slam your elbow onto its

02:24:31.364 --> 02:24:36.715
snout, knocking it out of the way. Just holding
on, holding off in this doorway. The one that runs

02:24:36.715 --> 02:24:42.416
up towards you is going to attempt to hit you
again with a club. That is going to be a 19. Again.

02:24:42.416 --> 02:24:43.500
LAURA: Ugh!

02:24:43.500 --> 02:24:50.110
MATT: Oh that's a d4, sorry. That's six points of
bludgeoning damage. Whack! As the club hits you in

02:24:50.110 --> 02:24:54.001
the back of the head as you're just climbing over
the top of the wall. You have to catch yourself

02:24:54.001 --> 02:24:57.670
from tumbling face first into the dirt on the
other side. You manage to catch your footing on

02:24:57.670 --> 02:25:02.481
top of the wall. But it's now up, and in
combat with both you and the guard from earlier.

02:25:02.481 --> 02:25:05.655
That ends their turn. Top of the round, Beau,
you're up.

02:25:05.655 --> 02:25:13.138
MARISHA: Oh god, okay. I'm going to taste a little
bit of blood that's now in my mouth, get real

02:25:13.138 --> 02:25:25.338
fucking pissed off, and I'm going to do a Star
Wars-style flourish and go crack down to the new guy.

02:25:25.338 --> 02:25:30.418
MATT: The skeletal one? There's a skeletal one,
and there's the one that's been fighting you this

02:25:30.418 --> 02:25:31.560
whole time.

02:25:31.560 --> 02:25:33.336
MARISHA: Which one looks like he has less damage?

02:25:33.336 --> 02:25:37.244
MATT: The skeletal one hasn't been damaged yet,
but it looks a little more fragile. The one that

02:25:37.244 --> 02:25:39.216
got shot by Nott earlier still has the big--

02:25:39.216 --> 02:25:40.440
MARISHA: Let's do the skeletal guy.

02:25:40.440 --> 02:25:41.952
MATT: Go for it. Do the attack.

02:25:41.952 --> 02:25:48.926
MARISHA: Not good at all. 14.

02:25:48.926 --> 02:25:53.366
MATT: That hits. Doesn't have as strong an armor class
as the other one.

02:25:53.366 --> 02:25:58.097
MARISHA: Okay. Eight points of damage.

02:25:58.097 --> 02:26:01.963
MATT: Eight points of damage. That one's already
been damaged previously. As you bring the staff

02:26:01.963 --> 02:26:06.671
down with both hands, whack, you slam right
through the center of its chest and clavicle. You

02:26:06.671 --> 02:26:10.238
watch as the torso breaks and folds from the
weight of the blow. The skull tumbles off and hits

02:26:10.238 --> 02:26:12.967
the ground, and it falls into a pile of bones and
rags.

02:26:12.967 --> 02:26:17.813
MARISHA: I'm going to use my bonus action. With
that momentum, I'm going to stick the staff in the

02:26:17.813 --> 02:26:24.282
ground, and use that to lift myself up and do a
two-footer kick into the other guy.

02:26:24.282 --> 02:26:26.812
MATT: Go for it. Single attack?

02:26:26.812 --> 02:26:30.517
MARISHA: Let's do Flurry of Blows.

02:26:30.517 --> 02:26:32.355
MATT: All right, so this is your third ki point?

02:26:32.355 --> 02:26:33.632
MARISHA: Nope, this is my second.

02:26:33.632 --> 02:26:36.584
MATT: Right, because you did the-- No, because you
did flurry earlier, didn't you?

02:26:36.584 --> 02:26:40.775
MARISHA: I did, but I did it as an action, not on
a bonus action, and you said I didn't have to use

02:26:40.775 --> 02:26:41.799
a ki point.

02:26:41.799 --> 02:26:43.906
MATT: No, a Flurry of Blows, I thought.

02:26:43.906 --> 02:26:51.039
MARISHA: I did Patient Defense, I did one Flurry
of Blows--

02:26:51.039 --> 02:26:54.336
MATT: You did the dodge action, as an action,
which doesn't take any ki points. You spent one

02:26:54.336 --> 02:26:56.466
doing a Flurry of Blows earlier.

02:26:56.466 --> 02:26:59.563
MARISHA: I spent one doing deflect, and then one
to do Flurry of Blows.

02:26:59.563 --> 02:27:00.940
MATT: This is your third one.

02:27:00.940 --> 02:27:03.236
MARISHA: No. This is the second one. This is the
first Flurry of Blows I'm doing.

02:27:03.236 --> 02:27:07.164
MATT: I'm sorry, that's what I was asking, my
confusion. Cool, so go for it.

02:27:07.164 --> 02:27:14.000
MARISHA: Shit, I don't remember. This was what I
rolled, right? Okay, not good. Ten.

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:21.339
MATT: Ten against him? Nope. As you kick both feet
forward, one hits and skims off the shoulder. The other?

02:27:21.339 --> 02:27:25.319
MARISHA: The other is okay. 15.

02:27:25.319 --> 02:27:30.137
MATT: 15 just hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

02:27:30.137 --> 02:27:35.204
TRAVIS: (singing) Pour some sugar on him.

02:27:35.204 --> 02:27:36.992
MARISHA: Seven.

02:27:36.992 --> 02:27:42.120
MATT: Seven points of damage? All righty, based on
the damage that you had sustained earlier and the

02:27:42.120 --> 02:27:46.368
blows from earlier, as you strike him with the
other foot, you snap the side of his jaw, which

02:27:46.368 --> 02:27:51.686
breaks out. As he stumbles backward, you take the
back of the staff and crack up underneath the jaw,

02:27:51.686 --> 02:28:00.276
snapping the neck the rest of the way, and it
falls to the ground, no longer moving. You still

02:28:00.276 --> 02:28:01.968
have your movement.

02:28:01.968 --> 02:28:10.176
MARISHA: Now I'm going to look around, and I'm
going to step back and into the house for just a minute.

02:28:10.176 --> 02:28:11.623
SAM: Into the house?

02:28:11.623 --> 02:28:13.830
TALIESIN: This is fine.

02:28:13.830 --> 02:28:23.704
MARISHA: This is fine. Just so I have cover. Right
in the doorway.

02:28:23.704 --> 02:28:26.455
TRAVIS: Just going to take a quick timeout.

02:28:26.455 --> 02:28:27.605
MARISHA: Quick timeout.

02:28:27.605 --> 02:28:30.646
SAM: There's a really loud ticking clock in the
room with you.

02:28:30.646 --> 02:28:34.654
MARISHA: You hear a (faint scream) in the
distance.

02:28:34.708 --> 02:28:38.606
MATT: With that, this gnoll is going to stand up.
Molly's on the wall.

02:28:38.606 --> 02:28:40.054
TALIESIN: I know, I'm being an asshole.

02:28:40.054 --> 02:28:42.879
MATT: It's okay. Stands up.

02:28:42.879 --> 02:28:46.968
TALIESIN: Man, I'm normally the one with shaky
hands.

02:28:46.968 --> 02:28:53.176
MATT: That's more because these walls are not the
most sturdy. There you go. Stands up to you. This

02:28:53.176 --> 02:29:06.599
one is going to step forward into the way. This
one is going to join in there. Those three now in

02:29:06.599 --> 02:29:15.914
visual range. These two are both going to take
shots at Jester. This one's going to take a shot

02:29:15.914 --> 02:29:27.103
at Fjord. Two longbows aiming in your direction.
That's a 20 and a natural one. The second one

02:29:27.103 --> 02:29:36.581
misses. You suffer eight points of piercing damage
as the arrow sinks right into your torso, right in

02:29:36.581 --> 02:29:39.868
the stomach area, and pierces through. You catch
it with your hand, but it's still a few inches

02:29:39.868 --> 02:29:45.477
into your actual midsection. Then there's the one
over here that turned around and sees you now

02:29:45.477 --> 02:29:48.112
engaging with the current pack leader.

02:29:48.112 --> 02:29:50.719
TRAVIS: But I'm a gnoll! Ah!

02:29:50.719 --> 02:29:52.429
MATT: That's a 15.

02:29:52.429 --> 02:29:53.991
TRAVIS: I'm just confused, that hits.

02:29:53.991 --> 02:30:03.134
MATT: That's going to be six points of piercing
damage. This one now slams into the side of your

02:30:03.134 --> 02:30:08.597
knee, and hits the meaty part, so thankfully it's
not locked in the bone or any of the joint, but it

02:30:08.597 --> 02:30:12.030
hits you in the side and you buckle to that side
from the pain.

02:30:12.030 --> 02:30:13.582
TRAVIS: Understood.

02:30:13.582 --> 02:30:26.886
MATT: This guy over here is going to leap down and
begin helping push the cart.

02:30:26.886 --> 02:30:28.849
ALL: No!

02:30:28.849 --> 02:30:37.132
MATT: With that, the cart pushes another full 40
feet and is currently off of the board. Let me

02:30:37.132 --> 02:30:38.812
mark it over here.

02:30:38.812 --> 02:30:40.081
MARISHA: How do we feel about the cart?

02:30:40.081 --> 02:30:41.340
LAURA: We got to get the cart!

02:30:41.340 --> 02:30:43.954
SAM: I can take a shot at the cart, but what is
one arrow going to do?

02:30:43.954 --> 02:30:46.569
TALIESIN: We can take out people pushing it.

02:30:46.569 --> 02:30:53.013
MATT: That finishes the gnolls' turn there. Oh,
there's the one that's attacking Molly. It's going

02:30:53.069 --> 02:30:58.802
to take its spear and attempt to two-hand strike
at you. That is cocked.

02:30:58.802 --> 02:31:03.368
TALIESIN: Does he have a spear? I thought he had a
bow. Oh, he's got both.

02:31:03.368 --> 02:31:04.991
MATT: 13 to hit, which I don't think hits.

02:31:04.991 --> 02:31:06.388
TALIESIN: No, it does not hit.

02:31:06.388 --> 02:31:12.806
MATT: You, on the wall, dance off the way, leap as
it goes up. All right, and I believe that's all

02:31:12.806 --> 02:31:17.470
the gnolls immediately in the vicinity that are in
combat. That ends the gnolls' turn. Fjord, you're up.

02:31:17.470 --> 02:31:24.511
TRAVIS: Yeah, great, awesome, sweet. Can I use
Eldritch Blast against the big fucking guy,

02:31:24.511 --> 02:31:27.581
because he didn't get any closer for a melee
attack, right?

02:31:27.581 --> 02:31:32.184
MATT: You're still within his attack range,
because he has the glaive. You do have

02:31:32.184 --> 02:31:34.127
disadvantage on Eldritch Blast.

02:31:34.127 --> 02:31:39.571
TRAVIS: Oh. Imma fucking move out of his attack
range. Does that give him attack of opportunity?

02:31:39.571 --> 02:31:41.591
ALL: Yes.

02:31:41.591 --> 02:31:45.237
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm doing that anyway. I'm going to
move back towards the corner where I was going.

02:31:45.237 --> 02:31:46.382
MATT: Right there?

02:31:46.382 --> 02:31:50.863
TRAVIS: No, all the way back. Back towards my
original hiding place.

02:31:50.863 --> 02:31:57.128
MATT: You pull back to the corner there. As you
pull back, he takes a step forward and reaches out

02:31:57.128 --> 02:31:59.100
with the glaive to try and strike you.

02:31:59.100 --> 02:32:01.021
SAM: Does he have any disadvantage or anything?

02:32:01.021 --> 02:32:02.903
MATT: Nope. That is a 23 to hit.

02:32:02.903 --> 02:32:04.565
TRAVIS: That hits.

02:32:04.565 --> 02:32:15.069
MATT: That is going to be ten points of slashing
damage. As you back away, arcs downward.

02:32:15.069 --> 02:32:27.617
TRAVIS: I will now, out of his melee range,
Eldritch Blast. Ugh, God, that's not great. 13.

02:32:27.617 --> 02:32:33.273
MATT: 13 does not hit. Now that it's seen the
Blast, after it strikes and grins you hear this

02:32:33.331 --> 02:32:38.336
(hyena chuckle) under its breath. You turn around
and go to strike out with the Eldritch Blast, and

02:32:38.336 --> 02:32:44.846
it pulls one of the other gnolls nearby and yanks
it in front of him, just as the shield takes it

02:32:44.846 --> 02:32:48.467
off, then sets him back in place. Deflects it with
its own guy.

02:32:48.467 --> 02:32:54.216
TRAVIS: Nice. As I'm pulling around the corner,
can I use my bonus action to drop the stupid,

02:32:54.216 --> 02:32:56.045
runty gnoll look?

02:32:56.045 --> 02:33:00.810
MATT: You don't have to spend a bonus action, you
just drop it. Pulling back from the fire, yeah,

02:33:00.810 --> 02:33:03.725
you can get just around that corner. The guard
lets you by.

02:33:03.725 --> 02:33:05.091
TRAVIS: I need cover.

02:33:05.091 --> 02:33:14.116
MATT: That ends your turn. The leader at this
point makes this loud gibbering sound that echoes

02:33:14.116 --> 02:33:21.525
throughout the alley, turns, and runs off to
pursue the cart.

02:33:21.525 --> 02:33:22.892
SAM: He left!

02:33:22.892 --> 02:33:26.549
TRAVIS: We're at level three, that's got to be an
acceptable option right now.

02:33:26.549 --> 02:33:27.796
SAM: No!

02:33:27.796 --> 02:33:30.211
LAURA: That means we almost killed him, that's
what that means! We almost had him.

02:33:30.211 --> 02:33:31.790
MARISHA: Do we chase after him?

02:33:31.790 --> 02:33:32.961
LAURA: Yeah.

02:33:32.961 --> 02:33:36.594
MATT: That ends his turn. The guards now, who have
notched their crossbows again, are going to take

02:33:36.594 --> 02:33:44.271
shots at both of those guys right there. Fucking
two. That does hit. The other one gets hit.

02:33:44.271 --> 02:33:48.728
LAURA: Have we killed any of the gnolls-gnolls?

02:33:48.728 --> 02:33:53.753
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's simple numbers. Them leaving is
a good--

02:33:53.753 --> 02:33:55.530
MATT: Molly, you're up.

02:33:55.530 --> 02:33:58.037
TALIESIN: I'm taking a slice at this guy again. I
don't have advantage anymore.

02:33:58.037 --> 02:33:59.707
MATT: You do not. He is not prone anymore,
unfortunately.

02:33:59.707 --> 02:34:03.031
TALIESIN: Slice number one. Oh, for fuck's sake.
Ten.

02:34:03.031 --> 02:34:04.765
MATT: Ten does not hit, unfortunately.

02:34:04.765 --> 02:34:08.306
TALIESIN: Slice number two. That hits, thank you!
23.

02:34:08.306 --> 02:34:10.170
MATT: 23 will hit. Go ahead and roll damage.

02:34:10.170 --> 02:34:19.325
TALIESIN: That's five points of damage and two
points of extra damage.

02:34:19.325 --> 02:34:24.950
MATT: Radiant? All right. The first one, you swing
and it ducks out of the way, and attempts to

02:34:24.950 --> 02:34:31.306
strike upward with its spear. As you do, you knock
it to the side, with the scimitar that missed, and

02:34:31.306 --> 02:34:36.512
with your other hand, strike down right across its
face. You arc through and you actually carve one

02:34:36.512 --> 02:34:40.504
of the eyes in twain. You see a large red mark
where you've split part of its face, and it's hurt

02:34:40.504 --> 02:34:44.759
really bad, but it's still standing. There's gore
dripping out of the socket where its ruined eye

02:34:44.759 --> 02:34:47.310
sits. (snarls)

02:34:47.310 --> 02:34:53.387
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and circle around it to
get out of the way of the archers. I'm going to

02:34:53.387 --> 02:34:55.188
hop back off and get behind him.

02:34:55.188 --> 02:35:00.332
MATT: You can do that without a problem. You
leapfrog off of him, grab his shoulders, and land

02:35:00.332 --> 02:35:04.678
behind him, scimitars at the ready. Okay, ending
Molly's turn. Jester, you're up.

02:35:04.678 --> 02:35:06.184
LAURA: What about the guards?

02:35:06.184 --> 02:35:09.975
MATT: The guards already went. Oh, she didn't
fire. Sorry, thank you for reminding me about

02:35:09.975 --> 02:35:12.723
that. The other guards did go, she did not-- They
did not.

02:35:12.723 --> 02:35:20.388
LAURA: Aren't they going to attack this skeleton
one that's right here next to both of us?

02:35:20.388 --> 02:35:28.004
MATT: They throw their crossbow to the ground and
pull out a morningstar, and does a sideswipe

02:35:28.004 --> 02:35:36.568
towards this-- That is a 19. We'll say that
straight up hits. That does five plus eight points

02:35:36.568 --> 02:35:43.422
of damage to that one. I don't think you've
damaged that one yet, right?

02:35:43.422 --> 02:35:46.034
LAURA: Yes I had. I did the Hellish Rebuke to it.

02:35:46.034 --> 02:35:50.268
MATT: That's right, you did! That was the wrong
one. All right, with that, they swing backwards

02:35:50.268 --> 02:35:54.790
with the mace and hit the side of the skeletal
head, which shatters immediately upon impact,

02:35:54.790 --> 02:35:58.618
ruining its form, and is no longer part of the
battle.

02:35:58.618 --> 02:36:00.479
LAURA: I am so surprised I fall off the wall!

02:36:00.479 --> 02:36:02.278
MATT: You are. You tumble that way.

02:36:02.278 --> 02:36:04.224
LIAM: Get out of the city!

02:36:04.224 --> 02:36:07.899
MATT: All righty. Jester, your turn.

02:36:07.899 --> 02:36:14.884
LAURA: Okay. Are either of those two gnolls over
there damaged?

02:36:14.884 --> 02:36:19.247
MATT: From what you can tell, nope.

02:36:19.247 --> 02:36:29.176
LAURA: Okay, well, I'm going to use my giant
lollipop, and it's going to swing and hit a couple

02:36:29.176 --> 02:36:31.212
times and try to hit one like a bat.

02:36:31.212 --> 02:36:32.749
MATT: Go for it.

02:36:32.749 --> 02:36:35.994
LAURA: Okay, this is the one you licked.

02:36:35.994 --> 02:36:37.216
SAM: Okay.

02:36:37.216 --> 02:36:40.156
LAURA: Eight.

02:36:40.156 --> 02:36:42.530
SAM: (sad trombone)

02:36:42.530 --> 02:36:45.438
LAURA: Sam's spit: not a good luck charm.

02:36:45.438 --> 02:36:50.576
MATT: As it swings in the air and spins, they both
take one step back and it hits the dirt, and they

02:36:50.576 --> 02:36:52.967
both look at each other, and (chuckles).

02:36:52.967 --> 02:37:01.725
LAURA: Shit. I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on
myself, and then I'm going to leap off the wall

02:37:01.725 --> 02:37:10.712
with great flourish and land next to Caleb. Okay,
that's a good idea. I'm going to land next to the

02:37:10.712 --> 02:37:16.280
guard. Then I'm going to skip away to the
building.

02:37:16.280 --> 02:37:22.428
MATT: There you go. All righty. That ends Jester's
turn. Caleb, Nott, you're up.

02:37:22.428 --> 02:37:29.695
LIAM: Okay, I'm just going to do my same dog and
pony show trick, I'm going to go to the corner, I

02:37:29.695 --> 02:37:33.069
should be able to see two or three gnolls, I
think, over there, yeah?

02:37:33.069 --> 02:37:34.362
MATT: Yes, over here.

02:37:34.362 --> 02:37:40.015
LIAM: Okay, so (sizzling) starts to burn in my
hand, Chromatic Orb out to hit whichever one--

02:37:40.015 --> 02:37:42.761
MATT: That one's probably the easiest to see right
now.

02:37:42.761 --> 02:37:49.740
LIAM: Then that's the one I'm going to go for.
Come on. Oh, that's good. That's a 17.

02:37:49.740 --> 02:37:50.938
MATT: That definitely hits.

02:37:50.938 --> 02:37:51.979
LIAM: Thanks, Keyleth.

02:37:51.979 --> 02:37:53.521
MARISHA: You're welcome, boo.

02:37:53.521 --> 02:38:05.528
LIAM: That is 3d8, so where is my eight-sided die?
There it is. This is fire, and it is 11 points of damage.

02:38:05.528 --> 02:38:13.215
MATT: As it bursts into it, you see the fur burn
and singe and (whimpers) pats it out and the

02:38:13.215 --> 02:38:16.904
flames subside, you see it's charred and burnt,
and you see the flesh is cracked and blackened.

02:38:16.904 --> 02:38:19.235
It's injured, but it's standing.

02:38:19.235 --> 02:38:23.903
LIAM: Okay, and I inch back again and say,
(singing) If it ain't broke, don't fix it. And

02:38:23.903 --> 02:38:25.360
hide behind the building.

02:38:25.360 --> 02:38:26.743
MATT: That ends your turn. Nott?

02:38:26.743 --> 02:38:30.778
SAM: There's two gnolls in front of me that I can
see, right?

02:38:30.778 --> 02:38:34.934
MATT: You can see those down there. The one just
got blasted with the familiar fiery explosion of

02:38:34.934 --> 02:38:37.312
Caleb's Chromatic Orb. The other is untouched.

02:38:37.312 --> 02:38:48.293
SAM: The other one, I will point at and I will
remove a tiny rotten tart from my pocket and

02:38:48.293 --> 02:38:59.394
crumple it onto the floor and take a feather and
move it around over the crumbs, and say: Hey, what

02:38:59.394 --> 02:39:13.300
happens to a frog's wagon when it breaks down? It
gets toad away! And I will cast Hideous Laughter

02:39:13.300 --> 02:39:15.413
on the gnoll.

02:39:15.413 --> 02:39:17.315
TRAVIS: Hideous indeed.

02:39:17.315 --> 02:39:20.708
MARISHA: No bad Halle Berry lines.

02:39:20.708 --> 02:39:25.808
MARISHA and LAURA: What happens to a toad when
it's struck by lightning? The same thing that

02:39:25.808 --> 02:39:27.980
happens to everything else.

02:39:27.980 --> 02:39:32.821
MATT: Wisdom saving throw? That is a natural 11.
What is your spell DC?

02:39:32.821 --> 02:39:33.826
SAM: 13.

02:39:33.826 --> 02:39:35.215
MATT: 13. All right.

02:39:35.215 --> 02:39:38.986
TALIESIN: I like the theory that he doesn't burst
into laughter, he just holds the groan pain.

02:39:38.986 --> 02:39:46.204
LIAM: I would like to think that he does laugh
hideously and despises himself for it.

02:39:46.204 --> 02:39:48.435
MATT: Did you shoot the one who was blasted with
the fire or the one that was untouched?

02:39:48.435 --> 02:39:50.231
SAM: The untouched one.

02:39:50.231 --> 02:39:54.949
MATT: You watch as the one that was currently
untouched that was drawing another arrow glances

02:39:54.949 --> 02:40:01.239
up and hears, and goes, (uncontrollable laughter)
and falls to the ground. (manic laughter) Laughing

02:40:01.239 --> 02:40:06.082
this horrible hyena chuckle, and it's billowing
out into the street, clutching its stomach and

02:40:06.082 --> 02:40:10.345
dropping its weapons to the side and just rolling
on the ground. Its friend next to it is like, huh?

02:40:10.345 --> 02:40:12.765
Looks up and sees you.

02:40:12.765 --> 02:40:16.916
SAM: Okay. All right, I'll use my bonus action to
hide.

02:40:16.916 --> 02:40:18.238
MATT: Go for it.

02:40:18.238 --> 02:40:25.543
SAM: Oh, I have to stealth. Oh, God damn. Okay,
that's 13.

02:40:25.543 --> 02:40:34.341
MATT: Okay. That ends your turn. There are no more
of the undead types, so they're off the thing.

02:40:34.341 --> 02:40:35.762
Beau, you're up.

02:40:35.762 --> 02:40:42.974
MARISHA: Okay, I step out of the burning building,
sauntering like a badass John Woo film.

02:40:42.974 --> 02:40:45.970
LIAM: Doves go everywhere.

02:40:45.970 --> 02:40:49.858
MATT: That's five feet of movement.

02:40:49.858 --> 02:40:54.423
MARISHA: Yeah, and looking at this one, I go: Hey,
your friends have an inside joke without you.

02:40:54.423 --> 02:41:00.887
Pointing at the guy on the ground. As soon as he
turns, I go whack like a baseball bat, right

02:41:00.887 --> 02:41:02.367
across his head.

02:41:02.367 --> 02:41:05.387
MATT: As soon as he glances over to the side, he
looks back just as you're already in his face.

02:41:05.387 --> 02:41:06.927
MARISHA: Oh, that's good.

02:41:06.927 --> 02:41:08.377
LIAM: Swing it high, Beau.

02:41:08.377 --> 02:41:10.684
MARISHA: 25! No, sorry, 24!

02:41:10.684 --> 02:41:12.756
MATT: 24, that'll definitely hit. Roll damage.

02:41:12.756 --> 02:41:14.874
LIAM: Swing away.

02:41:14.874 --> 02:41:22.722
MARISHA: I'm going to take that, that's a 13,
sorry, ten, nope, 11! Math.

02:41:22.722 --> 02:41:26.182
MATT: 11 points of damage. Whack! You watch as
about five or six gnoll teeth go flying from the

02:41:26.182 --> 02:41:32.428
impact, the jaw quivers as spittle and blood goes
careening off the side of the impact. It falls and

02:41:32.428 --> 02:41:34.057
stumbles, if you want to follow it up.

02:41:34.057 --> 02:41:40.468
MARISHA: I'm going to, using that momentum, do a
helicopter flourish above and go crack down over top.

02:41:40.468 --> 02:41:42.065
MATT: Go for it.

02:41:42.065 --> 02:41:44.699
MARISHA: That's a natural 19!

02:41:44.699 --> 02:41:46.371
MATT: That hits, go ahead and roll damage.

02:41:46.371 --> 02:41:49.299
MARISHA: Oh, wait, this is technically an
off-handed.

02:41:49.299 --> 02:41:52.020
MATT: Right, so it's a d4 for this one, but we're
using the staff for a flourish.

02:41:52.020 --> 02:41:54.647
MARISHA: Ooh, that's a four, so eight points of
damage.

02:41:54.647 --> 02:42:00.512
MATT: Eight points of damage. Wham! As you bring
it down over the top of the head, it falls and

02:42:00.512 --> 02:42:06.404
gets up, it's dazed and beaten within an inch of
its life, it's ready to go. It's barely standing

02:42:06.404 --> 02:42:11.163
at this point, one eye is lolling around and
trying to find, and the other one is swollen shut

02:42:11.163 --> 02:42:14.067
now and can't actually see anything. It's in a bad
place.

02:42:14.067 --> 02:42:16.064
MARISHA: Fuck. I'll hold.

02:42:16.064 --> 02:42:27.951
MATT: Okay. That ends your turn, Beau. The guy on
the ground is just laughing his ass off. At the

02:42:27.951 --> 02:42:32.375
end of its turn, it's going to try and make a
saving throw. No, that is a two. It is still

02:42:32.375 --> 02:42:41.059
laughing on the ground. This one, seeing the rest
of its allies run, turns around and is just going

02:42:41.059 --> 02:42:42.434
to run.

02:42:42.434 --> 02:42:44.229
SAM: That's the one you just hit?

02:42:44.229 --> 02:42:46.836
MARISHA: No. This here.

02:42:46.836 --> 02:42:48.622
SAM: How many are over there? Oh, I didn't see
it.

02:42:48.622 --> 02:42:49.925
TALIESIN: Two, and I've got one.

02:42:49.925 --> 02:42:52.616
MATT: This one, seeing another one flee, is going
to attempt to try and flee after. You get an

02:42:52.616 --> 02:42:53.925
attack of opportunity.

02:42:53.925 --> 02:42:55.187
MARISHA: I have advantage on that?

02:42:55.187 --> 02:42:56.153
MATT: You do not.

02:42:56.153 --> 02:43:00.246
MARISHA: Fuck. Oh, but that's still good. 18.

02:43:00.246 --> 02:43:01.713
MATT: That hits, roll damage.

02:43:01.713 --> 02:43:02.722
LAURA: Kill him!

02:43:02.722 --> 02:43:03.941
MARISHA: Is that with my regular attack?

02:43:03.941 --> 02:43:04.979
MATT: Yes.

02:43:04.979 --> 02:43:06.617
MARISHA: Eight damage.

02:43:06.617 --> 02:43:11.114
MATT: You knock and crush him to the floor. As he
tries to run, you whack and hit him, and you watch

02:43:11.114 --> 02:43:18.078
him take a few steps and skid and fall onto the
ground, and he's not moving. The one over here,

02:43:18.078 --> 02:43:22.365
who is not currently in the process of knowing
that everyone else is fleeing, because he's been

02:43:22.365 --> 02:43:24.990
stuck over here, is going to try to take a spear
attack at you, Molly.

02:43:24.990 --> 02:43:31.227
TALIESIN: I'm going to snap at him. I'm going to
use Blood Maledict.

02:43:31.227 --> 02:43:32.495
SAM: Hellish Snap.

02:43:32.495 --> 02:43:34.857
MATT: Which is good, because he rolled a natural
20 on the first roll.

02:43:34.899 --> 02:43:36.358
TALIESIN: Yeah, no he ain't.

02:43:36.358 --> 02:43:38.697
MATT: Disadvantage, that brings him to a 15.

02:43:38.697 --> 02:43:41.486
TALIESIN: That is my armor class.

02:43:41.486 --> 02:43:42.788
MATT: So it just hits you.

02:43:42.788 --> 02:43:46.101
LAURA: But at least it's not a critical attack.

02:43:46.101 --> 02:43:47.081
TALIESIN: Nope!

02:43:47.081 --> 02:43:50.360
LIAM: All his friends are running away, and he's
going, "Me and my friends are going to kill you."

02:43:50.360 --> 02:43:59.536
MATT: Eight points of piercing damage. Its eyes go
dark and it pulls back, and still it seems its

02:43:59.536 --> 02:44:04.928
sense of smell can still find your placement in
the vicinity, and as you pull out of the way, it

02:44:04.928 --> 02:44:10.528
still manages to find you. The spear pierces right
around where the hip is, and you pull back,

02:44:10.528 --> 02:44:13.527
gritting your teeth. That's going to end its go.

02:44:13.527 --> 02:44:18.041
TRAVIS: My turn.

02:44:18.041 --> 02:44:19.135
MATT: Yep.

02:44:19.135 --> 02:44:21.338
TRAVIS: Can I hop around the corner again?

02:44:21.338 --> 02:44:24.793
SAM: (engine revving) Start up the full.

02:44:24.793 --> 02:44:36.802
TRAVIS: I'll go ahead and use my 30 speed to close in on
the proned-out. Great, and I'll use Eldritch Blast

02:44:36.802 --> 02:44:38.148
against that.

02:44:38.148 --> 02:44:41.771
MATT: All right, it has disadvantage against it
because it's prone.

02:44:41.771 --> 02:44:43.444
TRAVIS: 11.

02:44:43.444 --> 02:44:48.399
MATT: 11. As it's rolling around on the ground,
it's difficult to find a proper shot, and you

02:44:48.399 --> 02:44:53.118
fire, and it hits the dirt next to it, sending a
bit of dust over it. It stops laughing for a

02:44:53.118 --> 02:44:57.642
second as the dust-- He laughs even harder at the
actual dust.

02:44:57.642 --> 02:44:59.668
TRAVIS: That's it. That's my turn.

02:44:59.668 --> 02:45:07.155
MATT: That ends your turn. All right. The guards
go. The leader continues to run, and is now

02:45:07.155 --> 02:45:11.065
disappearing into the smoke and ash. You don't
have a visual on the cart at the moment, it's now

02:45:11.065 --> 02:45:16.060
pressed into where a lot of the fire is, and it's
obscuring their escape. These guards are going to

02:45:16.060 --> 02:45:23.860
move forward as they load their crossbows, and
they're both-- actually, because he's on the

02:45:23.860 --> 02:45:26.462
ground laughing, you're coming out on the roof,
they're going to turn and fire at the one that's

02:45:26.462 --> 02:45:33.149
in front of Molly. It does have three-quarters
cover because of the wall. They're trying to help

02:45:33.149 --> 02:45:34.258
you out.

02:45:34.258 --> 02:45:35.995
TRAVIS: We need the assistance of guards, guys.

02:45:35.995 --> 02:45:38.534
MATT: Hits the wall and deflects.

02:45:38.534 --> 02:45:39.785
TRAVIS: It's hard.

02:45:39.785 --> 02:45:44.713
MATT: That does hit! That is a 21, actually, so
that does, even with the bonus to armor class from

02:45:44.713 --> 02:45:46.342
the three-quarters cover, it still hits.

02:45:46.342 --> 02:45:49.532
SAM: Those guards are killing more than we are.

02:45:49.532 --> 02:45:54.064
MATT: With that, as it's there in front of you
with its spear, after stabbing you, it pulls back

02:45:54.117 --> 02:46:04.037
and one crossbow bolt out of its forehead. 
Its jaw goes slack and falls to the ground, dead.

02:46:04.037 --> 02:46:05.787
TALIESIN: Oh, come on.

02:46:05.787 --> 02:46:09.036
SAM: Don't you want to ask that nameless guard how
he wants to do this?

02:46:09.036 --> 02:46:15.524
MATT: Well, there's still one left on the ground,
which we'll say for the purposes of narrative

02:46:15.524 --> 02:46:17.733
here, who wants to do this?

02:46:17.733 --> 02:46:21.256
TRAVIS: What, you really want to do something?

02:46:21.256 --> 02:46:23.291
SAM: Is it our turn soon? Caleb and me?

02:46:23.291 --> 02:46:24.351
LIAM: Yeah.

02:46:24.351 --> 02:46:28.222
MATT: Well, when we come back around, it would be
Molly's turn, Jester, then Caleb and Nott. So

02:46:28.222 --> 02:46:30.301
whatever you guys want to do in this moment before
it comes back, let me know.

02:46:30.301 --> 02:46:40.010
SAM: I would like to jump down from the wall and
run as fast as I can after the leader and the cart.

02:46:40.010 --> 02:46:41.211
TRAVIS: Really?

02:46:41.211 --> 02:46:42.182
MARISHA and LAURA: Whoa!

02:46:42.182 --> 02:46:43.717
MATT: Make an acrobatics check.

02:46:43.717 --> 02:46:48.623
SAM: Oh, disadvantage. Jesus. 11.

02:46:48.623 --> 02:46:54.442
MATT: You jump off the side and you land, you do
suffer four points of bludgeoning damage as you

02:46:54.442 --> 02:46:58.637
hit the ground and your feet buckle, and you
actually slam and your face hits the dirt, but you

02:46:58.637 --> 02:47:07.617
use your momentum to scurry back up, and beginning
to move forward, you get-- and if you're using the

02:47:07.617 --> 02:47:08.855
rest of your--

02:47:08.855 --> 02:47:09.956
SAM: Dash, everything.

02:47:09.956 --> 02:47:11.175
MATT: I need you to make a concentration check, by
the way.

02:47:11.175 --> 02:47:12.716
SAM: Oh.

02:47:12.716 --> 02:47:15.824
MATT: Make a constitution saving throw, because
you did take--

02:47:15.824 --> 02:47:18.787
SAM: This is a saving throw, that's not
disadvantage. 16.

02:47:18.787 --> 02:47:24.322
MATT: Yeah, so you maintain control over the
Hideous Laughter. Okay. You rush into the cloud of

02:47:24.322 --> 02:47:30.945
ash after them, and you begin to see some of the
shapes ahead of you of the gnolls there, pushing

02:47:30.945 --> 02:47:36.037
the cart. You're still behind them by about 30 or
so feet, and right as you rush forward, darting

02:47:36.037 --> 02:47:41.738
in, the heat from the embers entering your lungs
burn, and you put your mask over to block and help

02:47:41.738 --> 02:47:45.767
filter a bit, with the cloth and bandages, and
right as you rush forward, you see the back of

02:47:45.767 --> 02:47:52.597
the heavy armored leader, that's bringing up the
rear of where the cart is, and he turns and sees you.

02:47:52.597 --> 02:47:53.977
SAM: Oh god.

02:47:53.977 --> 02:48:01.200
MATT: As soon as you finish your movement, it
spins and looks in your vicinity, to see that

02:48:01.200 --> 02:48:02.458
you're alone.

02:48:02.458 --> 02:48:03.644
SAM: Oh god.

02:48:03.644 --> 02:48:05.353
MATT: Takes his glaive.

02:48:05.353 --> 02:48:06.325
SAM: Oh god!

02:48:06.325 --> 02:48:08.235
MATT: And closes the distance with a giant
downward swing.

02:48:08.235 --> 02:48:09.261
SAM: Oh god!

02:48:09.261 --> 02:48:10.481
LAURA: What did you do?

02:48:10.481 --> 02:48:13.906
TALIESIN: Wait, is it his turn already?

02:48:13.906 --> 02:48:16.760
MATT: At this point? The narrative timing on
this.

02:48:16.760 --> 02:48:19.161
TALIESIN: Because I was going to run that way too,
I thought we were still--

02:48:19.161 --> 02:48:20.407
LAURA: Yeah.

02:48:20.407 --> 02:48:22.568
MARISHA: Yeah, who was allowed to run?

02:48:22.568 --> 02:48:23.841
MATT: Well, Nott's after you.

02:48:23.841 --> 02:48:25.024
TALIESIN: Okay. So I will--

02:48:25.024 --> 02:48:27.177
LAURA: But we didn't get to go, because Nott just
jumped it.

02:48:27.177 --> 02:48:28.260
SAM: Yeah.

02:48:28.260 --> 02:48:32.629
MATT: All right, cool. All right, well let's roll
it back a little bit here and see how this helps

02:48:32.629 --> 02:48:36.462
you. All right, cool. So. No, it's fine. So
Jester, Molly, what are you guys doing?

02:48:36.462 --> 02:48:39.067
TALIESIN: I was going to run to see where the cart
was going. Full dash.

02:48:39.067 --> 02:48:48.607
MATT: Okay. As you sprint off, with a full dash,
you don't quite get as close as Nott does.

02:48:48.607 --> 02:48:49.750
TALIESIN: No, I wouldn't.

02:48:49.750 --> 02:48:52.693
MATT: Because Nott is much faster.

02:48:52.693 --> 02:48:55.348
TALIESIN: Is he triggering my spider sense at
all?

02:48:55.348 --> 02:48:56.394
MATT: No.

02:48:56.394 --> 02:48:57.264
TALIESIN: Okay.

02:48:57.264 --> 02:48:58.413
TRAVIS: What's your spider sense?

02:48:58.413 --> 02:48:59.290
MATT: It's not really a spider sense.

02:48:59.290 --> 02:49:00.302
TALIESIN: I know, but you know.

02:49:00.302 --> 02:49:01.328
SAM: But it's a spider sense.

02:49:01.328 --> 02:49:02.239
LAURA: Basically.

02:49:02.239 --> 02:49:04.420
MATT: You're about that far back, I would say.

02:49:04.420 --> 02:49:11.827
LAURA: I was going to have my duplicate go over
and touch the guy laughing on the ground, and cast

02:49:11.827 --> 02:49:13.707
Inflict Wounds.

02:49:13.707 --> 02:49:14.925
MATT: Go for it.

02:49:14.925 --> 02:49:16.233
MARISHA: Dope.

02:49:16.233 --> 02:49:20.996
MATT: It's a melee spell attack, correct? You have
advantage on it because he's currently

02:49:20.996 --> 02:49:22.316
incapacitated.

02:49:22.316 --> 02:49:25.034
LIAM: If he's still around when she's done, I
would have done my same single--

02:49:25.034 --> 02:49:26.094
LAURA: Natural 20.

02:49:26.094 --> 02:49:26.983
LIAM: Yeah!

02:49:26.983 --> 02:49:29.569
TRAVIS: That'll be all the damage.

02:49:29.569 --> 02:49:31.209
MATT: Oh my god. So roll the dice.

02:49:31.209 --> 02:49:32.915
MARISHA: He's going to turn into powder.

02:49:32.915 --> 02:49:35.190
LAURA: Five, six, 13, 26!

02:49:35.190 --> 02:49:43.647
MATT: As he's laughing, your image walks up with a
skip, bends down and touches him, and he suddenly

02:49:43.647 --> 02:49:51.570
withers into this completely dried-out husk of
what the gnoll once was, the life force drawn and

02:49:51.570 --> 02:49:56.185
cast out of his body. He stops laughing, and the
body falls like a mummy to the ground.

02:49:56.185 --> 02:50:00.458
SAM: Your duplicate can cast spells?

02:50:00.458 --> 02:50:05.161
LAURA: Yeah. That's why it's more fun if I can move
her.

02:50:05.161 --> 02:50:07.311
TALIESIN: That's why it's like a bear.

02:50:07.311 --> 02:50:12.982
MATT: All right, finishing those turns, back to
the top of the round.

02:50:12.982 --> 02:50:18.838
LIAM: No, I would have leaned out, if I had seen it
was dead, and no enemies, I would use my

02:50:18.838 --> 02:50:22.780
movement, my action to move further up to the
corner, not much besides that, but join where

02:50:22.780 --> 02:50:26.505
Fjord and the duplicate are. That's it.

02:50:26.505 --> 02:50:28.167
MATT: That ends your turn.

02:50:28.167 --> 02:50:30.510
TRAVIS: Your friend took off running.

02:50:30.510 --> 02:50:32.398
LIAM: Nott?

02:50:32.398 --> 02:50:36.091
LAURA: That's all happening right now.

02:50:36.091 --> 02:50:37.535
LIAM: This is simultaneous.

02:50:37.535 --> 02:50:38.991
MATT: Beau, your turn.

02:50:38.991 --> 02:50:48.614
MARISHA: Hearing you say that, I'm going to be like,
I guess we're-- race you! I'm going to take off

02:50:48.614 --> 02:50:49.939
running after Nott.

02:50:49.939 --> 02:50:51.132
MATT: Okay.

02:50:51.132 --> 02:50:54.285
MARISHA: 40 feet speed.

02:50:54.285 --> 02:51:00.876
MATT: You manage to catch up right around
basically where Molly is there. Do you have a ki

02:51:00.876 --> 02:51:01.888
point left?

02:51:01.888 --> 02:51:02.836
MARISHA: I do.

02:51:02.836 --> 02:51:04.125
MATT: If you wanted to use your--

02:51:04.125 --> 02:51:11.440
MARISHA: That would just get me-- I'll save it for
right now. But I can see Nott, and I can see the

02:51:11.440 --> 02:51:13.211
guy, and I can see the cart.

02:51:13.211 --> 02:51:17.514
MATT: There's cloud and ash, embers pushing into
the atmosphere now, the nearby building are

02:51:17.514 --> 02:51:19.771
actually in flames and engulfed on the side here.

02:51:19.771 --> 02:51:21.138
MARISHA: That was a double move?

02:51:21.138 --> 02:51:22.797
MATT: That was a double movement to get to there.

02:51:22.797 --> 02:51:24.014
MARISHA: All right.

02:51:24.014 --> 02:51:30.286
MATT: As you and Molly are 15, 20 feet from each
other, and ahead you can see the shape of Nott, and

02:51:30.286 --> 02:51:35.334
you can see the leader of them. You can now see
from nearby buildings that about ten other gnolls

02:51:35.334 --> 02:51:41.870
are all gathering around the cart and they're all
leaving. They're all carrying giant sacks on their back,

02:51:41.870 --> 02:51:44.303
dragging bodies and corpses behind them.

02:51:44.363 --> 02:51:45.580
MARISHA: Ten?

02:51:45.580 --> 02:51:49.068
MATT: Yeah. This wasn't the only gnolls that
attacked the city.

02:51:49.068 --> 02:51:53.227
TALIESIN: This was just our little patch. Our
gnoll patch.

02:51:53.227 --> 02:52:02.827
MATT: Finishing Beau's turn, it comes back to
Fjord. The rest of the gnolls continue pushing the

02:52:02.827 --> 02:52:08.180
cart. A few join them, giving it momentum.
About six more of them begin stepping up,

02:52:08.230 --> 02:52:10.839
flanking the leader, who's now staring at the
three of you.

02:52:10.839 --> 02:52:12.217
TALIESIN: Now's not the time!

02:52:12.217 --> 02:52:17.345
TRAVIS: I'll run forward using my 30 feet but
I will call out: Nott, get back here!

02:52:17.345 --> 02:52:23.324
SAM: What? Don't blow my cover.

02:52:23.324 --> 02:52:24.821
TRAVIS: Let them go!

02:52:24.821 --> 02:52:26.192
SAM: Okay. What?

02:52:26.192 --> 02:52:33.723
MATT: That ends Fjord's turn. The leader sees the
three of you there, puts the glaive away with one

02:52:33.723 --> 02:52:43.520
hand, turns around as he draws his longbow and
fires an arrow right at you. That is a 17 to hit?

02:52:43.520 --> 02:52:44.973
SAM: Hits.

02:52:44.973 --> 02:52:49.610
MATT: That is eight points of piercing damage.

02:52:49.610 --> 02:52:52.596
MARISHA: Are you down?

02:52:52.596 --> 02:52:54.112
TALIESIN: He is so down.

02:52:54.112 --> 02:53:02.653
MATT: The arrow strikes Nott in the chest, who
falls unconscious onto the ground, the ash and

02:53:02.653 --> 02:53:10.371
embers starting to spill over her unconscious
body. With that-- because I believe-- yeah, it can

02:53:10.371 --> 02:53:14.177
make two attacks with its longbow. He's going to
make a second strike now. This one's going to be

02:53:14.177 --> 02:53:22.132
at-- I'm going to make it-- He can't decide at the
moment. This'll be a four, Molly. That is a

02:53:22.132 --> 02:53:23.825
natural 20.

02:53:23.825 --> 02:53:25.417
(groaning)

02:53:25.417 --> 02:53:36.557
MATT: That is 18 plus three. 21 points of
piercing damage.

02:53:36.557 --> 02:53:38.176
TALIESIN: You got to be fucking kidding me,
really?

02:53:38.176 --> 02:53:39.997
MATT: He rolled a nine on a d10. And it's a crit.

02:53:39.997 --> 02:53:41.382
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm down.

02:53:41.382 --> 02:53:42.956
MATT: Molly goes down.

02:53:42.956 --> 02:53:44.186
SAM: Oh, shit.

02:53:44.186 --> 02:53:50.716
MATT: With his movement, he puts the bow back away
and keeps walking with the rest of the gnolls.

02:53:50.716 --> 02:53:55.882
MARISHA: I grab Fjord and I say, just wait. Wait.
Let them go.

02:53:55.882 --> 02:54:03.147
MATT: You watch as all of them turn around and
they all begin to gather. You hear this cacophony

02:54:03.147 --> 02:54:07.269
of different gibbering cries in the distance as
they're all starting to call themselves back to

02:54:07.269 --> 02:54:13.053
leave the city. They all step into the clouds of
smoke and ash in the distance before eventually

02:54:13.053 --> 02:54:15.523
all the shapes disappear.

02:54:15.523 --> 02:54:20.752
MARISHA: I want to watch them as far as I can to
try and pinpoint a direction that they're heading in.

02:54:20.752 --> 02:54:24.115
MATT: Okay, make a survival check in this moment.

02:54:24.115 --> 02:54:25.349
LIAM: It's dark, too.

02:54:25.349 --> 02:54:26.465
MATT: It is dark.

02:54:26.465 --> 02:54:29.619
MARISHA: Not great, 11.

02:54:29.619 --> 02:54:32.212
MATT: Okay. It's hard to tell with all the smoke,
you can't see the moon, you can't see the

02:54:32.212 --> 02:54:36.325
placement of the sky, but you make a note of which
direction they're traveling based on the street.

02:54:36.325 --> 02:54:42.379
Those who are both on the ground as Beau continues
doing this, you guys begin to rush up and you see

02:54:42.379 --> 02:54:44.808
both Molly and Nott on the ground.

02:54:44.808 --> 02:54:56.538
LAURA: I run up and I'll cast Cure Wounds on
Molly. Then I'm going to run over and do the same

02:54:56.538 --> 02:55:01.249
thing at level two to Nott. That's six points of
healing for you, I'm sorry.

02:55:01.249 --> 02:55:03.132
TALIESIN: Thank you.

02:55:03.132 --> 02:55:11.811
LAURA: I'll run up and cast it on Nott. Oh no, Nott!
I pull her up into my lap. Oh, that's good. 13--

02:55:11.811 --> 02:55:20.425
oh, 13 plus five! No, plus three.

02:55:20.425 --> 02:55:25.094
MATT: That immediate first breath is filled with
pain, both from the wounds you've sustained and

02:55:25.094 --> 02:55:31.140
the immediate influx of burning ash that sweeps
into your lungs. Both of you come to consciousness.

02:55:31.140 --> 02:55:34.056
SAM: (gasping) Oh my gods!

02:55:34.056 --> 02:55:36.190
TALIESIN: What were you thinking?

02:55:36.190 --> 02:55:41.737
SAM: I was just going to follow them from afar. I
forgot they had bows and arrows.

02:55:41.737 --> 02:55:44.293
TALIESIN: That's literally the only thing that's
been happening.

02:55:44.293 --> 02:55:48.314
SAM: I thought they wouldn't see me because of the
smoke. Oh boy.

02:55:48.314 --> 02:55:52.152
TALIESIN: I'm going to put out these fires. Oh,
I'm not getting up.

02:55:52.152 --> 02:55:54.612
MARISHA: Ah shit, the town, you guys! And I'm going to
go back and start trying to put out the fires.

02:55:54.612 --> 02:55:56.504
TALIESIN: I'm going to crawl back towards the--

02:55:56.504 --> 02:56:00.869
MATT: As you guys begin to regather your troops,
more of the crownsguard that you see have been

02:56:00.869 --> 02:56:05.665
battling and have been partially wounded by a lot
of the other gnolls are beginning to gather their

02:56:05.665 --> 02:56:08.479
dead, beginning to try and put out what fires they
can and acknowledge which buildings can't be

02:56:08.479 --> 02:56:14.355
saved. As you begin to take what remains of your energy to
do so, we're going to go ahead and take a break.

02:56:14.355 --> 02:56:22.247
We're going to take a break here, and we'll have a
little denouement to this episode tonight. But

02:56:22.247 --> 02:56:25.881
before I leave, we have another contest tonight.
Our friends at Wyrmwood actually have a pretty

02:56:25.881 --> 02:56:33.885
cool giveaway tonight. As part of their new
Kickstarter, they have this all-inclusive package

02:56:33.885 --> 02:56:44.333
here, which is both a dice box, with a leather
base, and on the inside here an all-inclusive

02:56:44.333 --> 02:56:45.770
package for your dice.

02:56:45.770 --> 02:56:46.921
SAM: We don't have those.

02:56:46.921 --> 02:56:55.018
MATT: No, they just started producing them. These
are walnut Adventurer's Arsenal kits, and we're

02:56:55.018 --> 02:57:01.795
giving away two of them. The keyword tonight is
map, M-A-P, based off last week's episode, thank

02:57:01.795 --> 02:57:06.867
you Deven. During the break in Twitch chat only,
come in there and when you're prompted go ahead

02:57:06.867 --> 02:57:10.692
and enter the keyword, map, into the chat only
once. More than once and you will be disqualified.

02:57:10.692 --> 02:57:14.261
Two of you will be chosen during the break, and
we'll come back to see who wins that. See you guys here

02:57:14.261 --> 02:57:15.729
in a few minutes.

02:57:15.729 --> 03:12:04.874
[break]

03:12:04.874 --> 03:12:10.531
MATT: Welcome back, everybody. That was on the
air, well done. The winner of the Adventure

03:12:10.607 --> 03:12:19.818
Arsenals are, we have two of them, TheBravestKoala
and GrandmasterBlaq. Congratulations to both of

03:12:19.818 --> 03:12:24.279
you guys for the win, go ahead and Danoba will
reach out to you and get your contact info and

03:12:24.279 --> 03:12:27.648
we'll get those to you. For those of you who are
curious to look at it, this particular

03:12:27.648 --> 03:12:33.351
Kickstarter you can find on wyrmwoodgaming.com
to look and see the cool thing this new release is

03:12:33.351 --> 03:12:44.413
going to entail, so thank you very much, Wyrmwood.
All right, with some of the flames dying down, 30

03:12:44.413 --> 03:12:49.778
minutes or so of the chaos descending, the
Crownsguard begin to come back, those that are

03:12:49.778 --> 03:12:56.401
still living, many of them wounded and tending to
their wounds, or helping the survivors that are

03:12:56.401 --> 03:13:01.909
still within the town. You see some families are
starting to unblock their entranceways and the

03:13:01.909 --> 03:13:05.669
people who had escaped the city are slowly
beginning to filter in. You can hear the sobbing

03:13:05.669 --> 03:13:11.280
in the distance of families that are coming back to
homes that have been destroyed. The smoke still

03:13:11.280 --> 03:13:21.115
chokes the air, and at this hour now it's probably
pushing close to 11:00 or later. But as the guards

03:13:21.115 --> 03:13:28.916
come through and begin to take in the essence of what's
happening, the armored individual that helped you

03:13:28.916 --> 03:13:35.283
when you first arrived and gave you the command to
aid in this approaches. You see their half-elven

03:13:35.283 --> 03:13:45.936
face, solemn and tense, approach and extend a
hand. "There aren't many who would immediately

03:13:45.936 --> 03:13:54.192
"jump into the fray as you did. I would say that we
would have lost many more, and perhaps all of my

03:13:54.192 --> 03:13:58.738
"men had you not been there, so thank you."

03:13:58.738 --> 03:14:03.081
LAURA: Of course, I say as I cut off the ears of
some of the gnolls.

03:14:03.081 --> 03:14:08.374
LIAM: You beat me to it. You said 30 minutes went
by, I wanted us to be doing that already.

03:14:08.374 --> 03:14:11.700
MARISHA: We're like: Oh no, put out this fire!

03:14:11.700 --> 03:14:14.871
LAURA: These people have lost everything!

03:14:14.871 --> 03:14:18.397
LIAM: I was just waiting for you to pause.

03:14:18.397 --> 03:14:23.586
MATT: Yeah, no worries. Unfortunately, for the
three skeletal ones you only manage to get one

03:14:23.586 --> 03:14:24.567
full ear.

03:14:24.567 --> 03:14:25.476
LIAM: That's fine.

03:14:25.476 --> 03:14:27.720
LAURA: That's okay because we got two ears
off of all the other ones.

03:14:27.720 --> 03:14:35.331
MATT: You did. We'll say for that, for those who
would've been destroyed or damaged, let me go

03:14:35.331 --> 03:14:37.310
ahead and roll and see how many ears you're able to
pull off of those bodies.

03:14:37.310 --> 03:14:39.931
LAURA: I'm also going pull off a chunk of tail and
see if it will pass.

03:14:39.931 --> 03:14:48.854
LIAM: I'd like to think that we leaned down to the
same gnoll, cutting, and went, same hat? Same hat.

03:14:48.854 --> 03:14:59.288
MATT: You manage to pull up about 12 ears intact
between all the fallen bodies. Some you killed,

03:14:59.288 --> 03:15:03.133
some maybe you didn't. You came across the body
elsewhere in the square and just took the ear.

03:15:03.133 --> 03:15:05.625
MARISHA: I totally remember kicking this guy's
ass.

03:15:05.625 --> 03:15:08.794
MATT: Other guards are collecting them as they go
and there are a couple moments where someone was

03:15:08.794 --> 03:15:14.002
going for an orc-- or a gnoll that you had killed
and you went to the guard and went, nuh-uh, and

03:15:14.002 --> 03:15:21.388
they backed off. But anyway, the soldier head that was
speaking with you extends a hand and they say, "I

03:15:21.388 --> 03:15:30.456
"am Watchmaster Bryce Feelid, assigned here to
Alfield, now in my fourth year. Thank you."

03:15:30.456 --> 03:15:34.913
MARISHA: Watchmaster?

03:15:34.913 --> 03:15:37.549
MATT: "Watchmaster Bryce Feelid."

03:15:37.549 --> 03:15:43.311
TRAVIS: What were those creatures? Have you
encountered them before?

03:15:43.372 --> 03:15:49.335
MATT: "We've encountered them before, yes, in
smaller hunting packs, maybe a half-dozen at a

03:15:49.335 --> 03:15:55.055
"time, usually on the outskirts. They don't come to
civilization like this. It's generally too

03:15:55.055 --> 03:16:01.388
"dangerous for them, in the smaller numbers they
travel. What the fuck are they after?"

03:16:01.388 --> 03:16:05.359
TRAVIS: Such a grizzly scene, they seemed to be
carrying away bodies on that cart they had.

03:16:05.359 --> 03:16:06.986
TALIESIN: That was weird.

03:16:06.986 --> 03:16:09.904
LAURA: Did you notice they had some undead
gnolls with them?

03:16:09.904 --> 03:16:10.952
TRAVIS: I did.

03:16:10.952 --> 03:16:12.039
TALIESIN: There were.

03:16:12.039 --> 03:16:13.831
LAURA: Have you ever seen anything like that?

03:16:13.831 --> 03:16:19.957
MATT: "I've maybe crossed one or two as part of
the roving packs, it's not terribly uncommon."

03:16:19.957 --> 03:16:25.176
TALIESIN: What turns them like that? Is there
something in the water?

03:16:25.176 --> 03:16:31.170
MATT: "I have no idea. I don't know the ins and
outs of their creepy bestial lifestyle. I mean,

03:16:31.170 --> 03:16:36.674
"what--" And you watch as they sit down for a
second, leaning against the wall, thinking and

03:16:36.674 --> 03:16:41.925
scratching at their chin, "Word came of a small
hunting party of these beasts spotted to the

03:16:41.925 --> 03:16:50.666
"south, so we sent a small troupe to slay them naught
but two hours before they struck here. We had sent

03:16:50.829 --> 03:16:56.070
"more than half of our men's strength to go and
deal with them, so we were unprepared and, at the

03:16:56.070 --> 03:17:07.128
"time, unguarded for the most part. We were caught
at half strength. It can't be a coincidence. They

03:17:07.128 --> 03:17:13.435
"must be desperate to assault head-on
like this. There's plenty of small game in the

03:17:13.435 --> 03:17:19.882
"surrounding wood and they're known to be provoked
to violence, but I've only heard of gnolls picking

03:17:19.882 --> 03:17:23.019
"off the outlying folk, those that wander too far
from the fields."

03:17:23.019 --> 03:17:25.352
LAURA: Do they eat the bodies?

03:17:25.352 --> 03:17:32.362
MATT: "They eat what flesh they can get a hold of,
but we went through a number of the buildings and

03:17:32.362 --> 03:17:41.560
"they've ransacked two of the inns. They completely
took the entire butcher's stock. They've carved

03:17:41.560 --> 03:17:44.588
"the city of whatever meats, fresh or dried, we
had."

03:17:44.588 --> 03:17:51.629
TALIESIN: Word came? Word came that they were in
the south? Where did word come from?

03:17:51.629 --> 03:17:55.557
MATT: "Word came from some of our crownsguard who
were running a patrol."

03:17:55.557 --> 03:18:01.727
LIAM: We have seen these things as far south as
Trostenwald. Further even.

03:18:01.727 --> 03:18:07.718
MARISHA: Has there been something else going on,
that you can think of, that might have cut off

03:18:07.718 --> 03:18:09.529
their food supply?

03:18:09.529 --> 03:18:14.441
MATT: "Not that I can think of. For the most part,
this far south, other than a few run-ins here and

03:18:14.441 --> 03:18:21.068
"there, they aren't-- conflicts of this size don't
make it past Bladegarden."

03:18:21.068 --> 03:18:23.643
MARISHA: Bladegarden?

03:18:23.643 --> 03:18:30.700
MATT: "It's where most of them-- It's where most
of the Empire's military and guard are trained and

03:18:30.700 --> 03:18:39.188
"then sent out throughout the rest of the valley.
That's a lot of meat that they've acquired from

03:18:39.188 --> 03:18:45.582
"us, and they've lost many, I thought, of their kin in
this battle as well."

03:18:45.582 --> 03:18:49.161
LAURA: Too much meat. What are they feeding?

03:18:49.161 --> 03:18:51.456
MATT: "Or what's making them so hungry?"

03:18:51.456 --> 03:18:53.188
LAURA: Oh. Or that.

03:18:53.188 --> 03:19:03.274
TRAVIS: Indeed. My concern is that they'll return.
We've fended them off for now, but they'll come back.

03:19:03.274 --> 03:19:06.895
MARISHA: Especially if they're as desperate as you
say they are.

03:19:06.895 --> 03:19:15.068
MATT: "I've sent three of our scouts to try and
find out where they went, track wherever they're

03:19:15.068 --> 03:19:24.332
"taking their spoils. Reports come in that most of
the bodies they took were dead, perhaps not all.

03:19:24.332 --> 03:19:31.474
"We have to do our best to at least recover any
survivors, wipe out what remains, and prevent this

03:19:31.474 --> 03:19:33.175
"from ever happening again."

03:19:33.175 --> 03:19:39.729
MARISHA: Have you heard local farmers complaining
about them stealing livestock? Missing livestock?

03:19:39.729 --> 03:19:46.380
MATT: "I'm going to look into that, actually. I'm
sorry, I'm still gathering my thoughts."

03:19:46.380 --> 03:19:50.538
LAURA: (gasps) W.C! I get up and I run and see if
our horse is still there.

03:19:50.538 --> 03:19:51.763
MARISHA: Oh, W.C.

03:19:51.763 --> 03:19:58.559
MATT: Okay, so you charge out to the far city and
you do find W.C., still affixed to the cart,

03:19:58.559 --> 03:20:06.106
currently chewing on a small bag of oats where one
of the families of villagers who fled have come

03:20:06.106 --> 03:20:07.827
back and begun to feed him.

03:20:07.827 --> 03:20:15.372
LAURA: Thanks, man! Thumbs up to the family, I'll
run back to the group.

03:20:15.372 --> 03:20:18.528
TRAVIS: Are you going to run back to the group, or
bring W.C. with?

03:20:18.528 --> 03:20:20.059
LAURA: No, I'm going to leave it out there.

03:20:20.059 --> 03:20:21.506
TRAVIS: Oh, cool, okay.

03:20:21.506 --> 03:20:22.598
TALIESIN: Petting zoo.

03:20:22.598 --> 03:20:24.197
LAURA: Yeah, they're petting him.

03:20:24.197 --> 03:20:32.368
MATT: To the rest of you, Bryce says, "Well, as
rash as it was said-- and our coffers are not as

03:20:32.368 --> 03:20:40.122
"strong as they could be, I will request more of a
monetary influx up north-- for the ears you have

03:20:40.122 --> 03:20:45.031
"taken you will be paid. Any more that you find,
those will be paid as well."

03:20:45.031 --> 03:20:49.960
TALIESIN: Well, and we're going to need some
lodging anyway, so perhaps some trade could be

03:20:49.960 --> 03:20:52.672
worked out.

03:20:52.672 --> 03:20:58.791
TRAVIS: Indeed, we could provide some extra
muscle, perhaps for some lodging while we stay and

03:20:58.791 --> 03:21:03.037
maybe we could aid your men and their efforts to
exterminate this foe.

03:21:03.037 --> 03:21:10.082
MATT: "Well, I would normally put you up in the
Candleglow Inn but--" They gesture over towards the

03:21:10.082 --> 03:21:14.002
large building that you had walked through that's
now currently--

03:21:14.002 --> 03:21:16.442
TALIESIN: It's literally glowing like a candle
right now.

03:21:16.442 --> 03:21:19.297
MATT: "That is ironic now that you point it out."

03:21:19.297 --> 03:21:21.461
TALIESIN: I feel really bad for saying that out
loud.

03:21:21.461 --> 03:21:25.053
MATT: "Let's just not let Thadeus know that his
life is--"

03:21:25.053 --> 03:21:29.652
LIAM: I have a question. After listening to this
for a while, I start looking around the town, would

03:21:29.652 --> 03:21:34.140
you say that with all these burnt buildings
everywhere, that if I start picking through the

03:21:34.140 --> 03:21:40.087
rubble I would find enough charcoal to reduce
the costs I would need for Find Familiar,

03:21:40.087 --> 03:21:46.025
eventually? Because I still need the incense and
the herbs, but if I get a lot of charcoal from these

03:21:46.167 --> 03:21:47.230
burnt homes--

03:21:47.230 --> 03:21:51.577
MATT: I will say if you take 30 minutes to find
good pieces of charcoal, and roll an investigation check.

03:21:51.577 --> 03:21:52.856
LIAM: Yeah.

03:21:52.856 --> 03:21:53.770
TRAVIS: Nein.

03:21:53.770 --> 03:22:00.470
LIAM: Yeah, done and done. That's good, and I have
a good investigation too. That is a 23.

03:22:00.470 --> 03:22:04.796
MATT: All right, you manage to reduce the cost of
you next Find Familiar spell by three gold pieces.

03:22:04.796 --> 03:22:05.966
LIAM: Yeah, good, that's good.

03:22:05.966 --> 03:22:17.624
MATT: From the hopes and dreams of Alfield. So
Bryce looks at you. "I can have you put up at the

03:22:17.624 --> 03:22:19.315
"Feed and Mead tavern."

03:22:19.315 --> 03:22:20.468
SAM: Feed and Mead?

03:22:20.468 --> 03:22:25.324
MATT: "Feed and Mead tavern. It's not the most
comfortable place, but it'll do."

03:22:25.324 --> 03:22:26.890
MARISHA: It's a good name.

03:22:26.890 --> 03:22:30.784
MATT: "I did not name it, but pass it on to Crute,
the owner."

03:22:30.784 --> 03:22:32.341
TRAVIS: Crute?

03:22:32.341 --> 03:22:38.255
MATT: "Tell him that Bryce sent you and you are
being put up by the Crown for as long as you are

03:22:38.255 --> 03:22:40.690
"hunting these creatures."

03:22:40.690 --> 03:22:48.915
TRAVIS: We appreciate that. Hopefully, there won't
be another call to action while they're here, but

03:22:48.915 --> 03:22:51.054
you can count on us if there is.

03:22:51.054 --> 03:23:03.762
MATT: "Of course. Well." They reach into a pouch
and begin to count out the gold for the number of

03:23:03.762 --> 03:23:07.247
ears you've collected. With twelve ears--

03:23:07.247 --> 03:23:08.601
LAURA: 360 gold.

03:23:08.601 --> 03:23:09.613
MATT: Mm-hmm.

03:23:09.613 --> 03:23:10.697
MARISHA: Dope.

03:23:10.697 --> 03:23:16.413
MATT: After bringing the ears forward, they glance
over. "Actually, I'll be right back. I may need to

03:23:16.413 --> 03:23:23.281
"acquire a bit more change." And after a brief
wait, Bryce returns and you are paid the full amount.

03:23:23.281 --> 03:23:24.883
TRAVIS: Damn.

03:23:24.883 --> 03:23:26.546
MATT: So 360 gold at your disposal.

03:23:26.546 --> 03:23:28.427
SAM: Should we divvy it up equally?

03:23:28.427 --> 03:23:33.986
LAURA: If we do, that's 60 gold apiece. That's
Laura talking.

03:23:33.986 --> 03:23:36.141
(laughter)

03:23:36.141 --> 03:23:37.530
MARISHA: I'm fine with that.

03:23:37.530 --> 03:23:44.825
MATT: Bryce says, "We hope to hear back in the
morning of our scouts' findings. If you wish to,

03:23:44.825 --> 03:23:54.187
"if you can hunt whatever remains of these
creatures and bring back proof that they've been

03:23:54.187 --> 03:24:01.874
"wiped out, I'll see what I can have sent southward
of Zadash to make it worth your while."

03:24:01.874 --> 03:24:08.347
MARISHA: In the meantime, you wouldn't have
anything that might help us and our little

03:24:08.347 --> 03:24:15.159
expedition, would you? Healing potion might be
nice if you got one hiding away somewhere in a

03:24:15.159 --> 03:24:16.654
closet, forgotten.

03:24:16.654 --> 03:24:26.261
MATT: "I don't mean to be brusque, but at the
moment I think we have a number of our guard who

03:24:26.261 --> 03:24:28.369
"are in more desperate need."

03:24:28.369 --> 03:24:30.308
MARISHA: Fair.

03:24:30.308 --> 03:24:34.313
LAURA: I can help them... in the morning.

03:24:34.313 --> 03:24:36.167
(laughter)

03:24:36.167 --> 03:24:44.164
MATT: "I'm sure that would be appreciated. For the
moment, you all look about as battered as I feel. Rest

03:24:44.164 --> 03:24:58.222
"up, come--" Let's see, they would be at-- "Meet me
outside of the Broad Barn."

03:24:58.222 --> 03:25:00.763
SAM: The "Rod Bawn"?

03:25:00.763 --> 03:25:02.223
MATT: "The Broad Barn."

03:25:02.223 --> 03:25:03.249
LAURA: The broad?

03:25:03.249 --> 03:25:04.528
MATT: Barn. Broad Barn.

03:25:04.528 --> 03:25:14.681
They point it out to you, it's on the
western side of the town. "There, we'll make sure

03:25:14.681 --> 03:25:20.453
"you get the basic supplies necessary. Hopefully,
we'll have information on where to go, and if you

03:25:20.453 --> 03:25:31.130
"so choose, we could conscribe you to be under our
intent to destroy these creatures. Think on it,

03:25:31.130 --> 03:25:37.758
"rest, we'll speak in the morning." Bryce turns
around and limps off with a few of the other

03:25:37.758 --> 03:25:47.422
crownsguard. As you guys eventually find your way
to the Feed and Mead, you are immediately met by

03:25:47.422 --> 03:25:58.653
Crute, who is this ornery, salty-looking dwarf of
tousled white-gray hair, this single tuft of a

03:25:58.653 --> 03:26:05.747
beard that dangles down towards the belly button
before it hits a ring of gold, goes, "Oh, so I've

03:26:05.747 --> 03:26:10.915
"been told you're the ones who were coming to
sleep. Got one of our two rooms for you."

03:26:10.915 --> 03:26:12.464
SAM: One?

03:26:12.464 --> 03:26:15.971
MATT: He never quite makes eye contact with you.
He's looking at your shoulder, or right above your face.

03:26:15.971 --> 03:26:19.462
SAM: I think he's got two glass eyes.

03:26:19.462 --> 03:26:27.864
MATT: "Come, I'll show you." Turns around and
leads you to your space. There are four beds

03:26:27.864 --> 03:26:35.205
jammed in here. It's like a youth hostel-type
living situation here, but it's functional.

03:26:35.205 --> 03:26:38.224
LAURA: Are they doubles? Fulls? Queens? Twins?

03:26:38.224 --> 03:26:42.758
MATT: They are pretty much as twin bed as you can
get.

03:26:42.758 --> 03:26:47.313
MARISHA and TALIESIN: I'm fine with the floor.

03:26:47.313 --> 03:26:50.158
TRAVIS: I'm great with a bed.

03:26:50.158 --> 03:26:57.430
LIAM: I've already got the silver thread out and I
am looping it over any open window and by the door.

03:26:57.430 --> 03:26:59.864
TALIESIN: Was there beer downstairs? Was there
ale?

03:26:59.864 --> 03:27:01.097
MATT: You can go ask.

03:27:01.097 --> 03:27:04.162
TALIESIN: I'm going to drop my things and run
downstairs.

03:27:04.162 --> 03:27:09.098
MATT: Okay. You come downstairs and there's nobody
inside, this is not a tavern night for a lot of

03:27:09.098 --> 03:27:12.044
people. "Right, can I help you?"

03:27:12.044 --> 03:27:15.060
TALIESIN: Is there drink? Is there smoke?

03:27:15.060 --> 03:27:19.980
MATT: "Smoke we don't have. But drink, that I can
give you."

03:27:19.980 --> 03:27:22.043
TALIESIN: I'll take something interesting.

03:27:22.043 --> 03:27:30.675
MATT: "Interesting, you say. Heh." Takes out a
bottle, looks like a deep green glass, and uncorks

03:27:30.675 --> 03:27:39.526
it. Takes a small shot glass that has a bulbous
bottom, pours it to the very top with this liquid

03:27:39.526 --> 03:27:46.582
that looks a deep sea-teal green, and slides
it forward.

03:27:46.582 --> 03:27:48.162
TALIESIN: Fast or slow?

03:27:48.162 --> 03:27:49.904
MATT: "Well, depends on how much you like to
dream."

03:27:49.904 --> 03:27:52.446
TALIESIN: How much?

03:27:52.446 --> 03:27:56.175
MATT: "For that, and for what I heard you did,
it's on the house."

03:27:56.175 --> 03:27:57.859
TALIESIN: Nonsense.

03:27:57.859 --> 03:28:01.905
MATT: "For the night. You want more, you're paying
top-shelf price."

03:28:01.905 --> 03:28:03.328
TALIESIN: What's top-shelf price?

03:28:03.328 --> 03:28:07.494
MATT: "For that drink there, that would run you
about three silver."

03:28:07.494 --> 03:28:10.219
TALIESIN: I put a gold on the table.

03:28:10.219 --> 03:28:11.860
MATT: "Not going to complain."

03:28:11.860 --> 03:28:16.133
TALIESIN: Consider it an advance, it's been a
rough night for everybody."

03:28:16.133 --> 03:28:17.531
MATT: "Right, right, of course."

03:28:17.531 --> 03:28:19.264
TALIESIN: And I'm going to sip this mother.

03:28:19.264 --> 03:28:31.498
MATT: It has a very smoky, oak-barrel flavor to it
at first as it hits your tongue and then it burns

03:28:31.498 --> 03:28:38.968
into this very medicinal, herbal, almost anise
mixed with burnt charcoal.

03:28:38.968 --> 03:28:45.157
TALIESIN: That sounds nice. I'm going to sit, and
sip this, and grin, and very silently have a mild

03:28:45.157 --> 03:28:47.296
nervous breakdown about what just went down.

03:28:47.296 --> 03:29:02.651
MATT: Okay. As you all slowly come to rest,
exhausted, sore, beaten, trying to fall asleep to

03:29:02.651 --> 03:29:05.661
the distant muffled sound of shouts and wailing in
the streets--

03:29:05.661 --> 03:29:08.184
LAURA and MATT: And Jester jumping on the bed.

03:29:08.184 --> 03:29:09.881
TRAVIS: Jester!

03:29:09.881 --> 03:29:14.538
MATT: You find yourself to rest, preparing for
what the morning may hold, and that's where we're

03:29:14.538 --> 03:29:16.146
going to pick up for next week's session.

03:29:16.146 --> 03:29:19.205
LAURA: Worst roommate ever.

03:29:19.205 --> 03:29:28.317
LIAM: You're not the only one. Caleb is going: one
gold, two gold, three gold, 60 gold.

03:29:28.317 --> 03:29:30.089
LAURA: 60 gold, Caleb!

03:29:30.089 --> 03:29:31.648
LIAM: This was a good idea.

03:29:31.648 --> 03:29:35.595
TALIESIN: This is working out weirdly, I'm
excited.

03:29:35.595 --> 03:29:36.863
MARISHA: We all have an extra 60 gold, yeah?

03:29:36.863 --> 03:29:40.702
LAURA: For all the work that Beau did.

03:29:40.702 --> 03:29:42.467
(laughter)

03:29:42.467 --> 03:29:48.509
MATT: That was some Jackie Chan shit. You were in
the doorway, dodging everything.

03:29:48.509 --> 03:29:52.610
TALIESIN: We now need to have a Stephen Chow
night, that was some crazy shit.

03:29:52.610 --> 03:29:55.346
LIAM: We are hitching out stars to your wagon.

03:29:55.346 --> 03:29:57.466
(laughter)

03:29:57.466 --> 03:30:01.391
LIAM: She just shot some Sun Chip out of her
mouth. You're welcome, internet!

03:30:01.391 --> 03:30:04.247
MATT: Gif that.

03:30:04.247 --> 03:30:08.199
MARISHA: Oh, there it is, I found it.

03:30:08.199 --> 03:30:09.585
SAM and LAURA: (groan)

03:30:09.585 --> 03:30:14.108
MATT: Waste not, want not. That's my wife, ladies
and gentlemen. Thank you guys so much. Thank you

03:30:14.108 --> 03:30:19.394
guys for watching. Thank you, D&amp;amp;D Beyond, I'm
learning more and more about the app and I'm

03:30:19.394 --> 03:30:22.976
enjoying it, thank you for supporting the show.
Thank you all for joining us tonight, we'll see

03:30:22.976 --> 03:30:25.908
you next week, and is it Thursday yet?

03:30:25.908 --> 03:30:26.926
LIAM: Nein!

03:30:26.926 --> 03:30:28.469
MATT: Good night, everybody.

00:00:00.187 --> 00:00:01.732
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode

2
00:00:01.732 --> 00:00:03.669
of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

3
00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:05.256
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

4
00:00:05.256 --> 00:00:07.452
TRAVIS: (hollering) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

5
00:00:07.452 --> 00:00:08.332
MARISHA: Sometimes.

6
00:00:08.332 --> 00:00:10.097
MATT: Sometimes, there, you have it.

7
00:00:10.097 --> 00:00:12.477
So hello and welcome! Before we jump into

8
00:00:12.477 --> 00:00:15.507
tonight's session, we have a couple of announcements,

9
00:00:15.507 --> 00:00:17.817
beginning with our two fantastic sponsors for the evening.

10
00:00:17.817 --> 00:00:20.831
First up, our friends since the beginning of this campaign,

11
00:00:20.831 --> 00:00:22.327
D&amp;D Beyond. Sam.

TRAVIS: Oh my god.

15
00:00:25.504 --> 00:00:28.316
SAM: It's October 24th, everybody,

16
00:00:28.316 --> 00:00:30.859
which means it's officionally?

17
00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:32.266
(laughter)

18
00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:33.672
TRAVIS: He's overheating!
MARISHA: Nailed it.

19
00:00:33.672 --> 00:00:36.449
SAM: It's officially winter in Los Angeles.

20
00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:39.724
Today was a chilly 91 outside,

21
00:00:39.724 --> 00:00:42.732
and you know who's already feeling that holiday spirit?

22
00:00:42.732 --> 00:00:44.060
D&amp;D Beyond.

23
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.710
To warm your spirits, they'll be at Gamehole Con

24
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.135
next month, hosting a series of games

25
00:00:50.135 --> 00:00:52.373
during the convention on their own Twitch channel,

26
00:00:52.373 --> 00:00:57.003
which is D-- nope. twitch.tv/dndbeyond,

27
00:00:57.003 --> 00:00:59.084
including one with DM Chris Perkins

28
00:00:59.084 --> 00:01:01.571
and another one with DM Mike Mearls!

29
00:01:01.571 --> 00:01:03.847
Both streams will raise money for Extra Life,

30
00:01:03.847 --> 00:01:06.204
a charity that unites thousands of gamers

31
00:01:06.204 --> 00:01:08.297
in support of local children's hospitals

32
00:01:08.297 --> 00:01:10.388
across North America.
TRAVIS: Woo!

33
00:01:10.388 --> 00:01:11.990
SAM: Yes, it's good.

34
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.939
Tune in to D&amp;D Beyond's Twitch channel during Gamehole Con,

And just to say thanks, me and Liam

38
00:01:25.322 --> 00:01:29.436
stepped out of the studio earlier today.

39
00:01:29.436 --> 00:01:31.965
We braved the winter cold of Los Angeles.

40
00:01:31.965 --> 00:01:33.649
LIAM: Burbank is fucking cold.

41
00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:36.112
SAM: Yeah, and we shot just a quick little fun video

42
00:01:36.112 --> 00:01:37.801
to say thanks to D&amp;D Beyond.

43
00:01:37.801 --> 00:01:40.241
So let's roll that clip of LA.

SAM: Happy winter from D&amp;D Beyond.

46
00:01:43.497 --> 00:01:46.504
This is Sam Riegel. I'm joined by Liam O'Brien,

47
00:01:46.504 --> 00:01:48.390
and we're talking about D&amp;D Beyond,

48
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.481
a great app where you can manage your characters and stats,

49
00:01:52.481 --> 00:01:57.481
and just focus on role playing. Fuck!

50
00:01:57.606 --> 00:02:00.547
And focusing on having fun with your friends.

51
00:02:00.547 --> 00:02:04.174
D&amp;D Beyond takes all the guesswork out of playing

52
00:02:04.174 --> 00:02:06.531
Dungeons &amp; Dragons Fifth Edition with your friends.

53
00:02:06.531 --> 00:02:11.094
Check it out right now on dndbeyond.com, and remember...

54
00:02:11.094 --> 00:02:13.169
Fuck! (laughter)

55
00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:14.969
That's it, I'm done!

56
00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:15.802
No!

57
00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:18.529
MARISHA: (laughs)

58
00:02:18.529 --> 00:02:23.529
SAM: Happy winter, everybody! Stay warm in there.

59
00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:25.809
Love you, D&amp;D Beyond. Over to you, Matt.

60
00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:27.629
TRAVIS: Where did you find that much asbestos?

61
00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:30.182
LIAM: The 405 is real slippery, careful out there, folks.

62
00:02:30.182 --> 00:02:31.718
(laughter)

63
00:02:31.718 --> 00:02:34.126
MARISHA: Man.
MATT: That is definitely more my weather.

64
00:02:34.126 --> 00:02:35.896
So thank you, D&amp;D Beyond.

65
00:02:35.896 --> 00:02:37.698
Also, our second sponsor tonight,

66
00:02:37.698 --> 00:02:40.101
our friends at Hit Point Press, actually.

67
00:02:40.101 --> 00:02:42.354
For those who aren't familiar with their current project,

68
00:02:42.354 --> 00:02:43.551
you may have seen it go up on Kickstarter last year,

69
00:02:43.551 --> 00:02:45.187
but they have an exciting new campaign guide

70
00:02:45.187 --> 00:02:48.353
set for Fifth Edition called Humblewood.

71
00:02:48.353 --> 00:02:49.253
MARISHA: I want to play it!
MATT: Yep.

72
00:02:49.253 --> 00:02:51.803
You get to play as birdfolk and woodland creatures,

73
00:02:51.803 --> 00:02:54.758
it's awesome, it's thematic, the art is incredible.

74
00:02:54.758 --> 00:02:57.258
From Leesha, a friend of the show.

75
00:02:58.107 --> 00:02:59.561
I, myself, backed this Kickstarter

76
00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:02.112
and I'm super excited checking out the actual physical book.

77
00:03:02.112 --> 00:03:03.494
It has character creation, it has

78
00:03:03.494 --> 00:03:05.302
world building elements, even has a full adventure

79
00:03:05.302 --> 00:03:08.662
for new characters at beginning level

80
00:03:08.662 --> 00:03:10.871
to save Humblewood from a great fire,

81
00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:11.991
which is very thematic for those of us

82
00:03:11.991 --> 00:03:14.211
in California right now.

83
00:03:14.211 --> 00:03:16.303
This launches at the end of November,

84
00:03:16.303 --> 00:03:18.411
just in time for the holidays, keep that in mind.

00:03:18.411 --> 00:03:21.153

MATT: It's pretty badass.

92
00:03:37.127 --> 00:03:40.009
There's the little owl. It's adorable.

93
00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:41.417
LIAM: So cute!
MATT: The art is incredible.

94
00:03:41.417 --> 00:03:43.385
I'm going to show a couple little pieces of art here,

95
00:03:43.385 --> 00:03:44.337
because they're amazing.

96
00:03:44.337 --> 00:03:48.170
Here's the strig race, and it's amazing.

97
00:03:49.571 --> 00:03:51.055
It's stupid adorable--

98
00:03:51.055 --> 00:03:52.388
LIAM: Wicker cat!
MATT: -- so please, check it out.

Marisha, you have a couple updates

103

MARISHA: Everyone likes it, so, yeah.

116

SAM: Who dies in episode two?

117
00:04:27.579 --> 00:04:30.529
Does anyone die in episode two?
MARISHA: You'll have to watch and find out.

Don't--
TRAVIS: What?

119
00:04:31.838 --> 00:04:32.674

MARISHA: (sighs)
TRAVIS: He's asking. Are we not?

121
00:04:34.921 --> 00:04:35.754
Oh.

122
00:04:35.754 --> 00:04:37.146
MATT: Because now either you've spoiled it,

123
00:04:37.146 --> 00:04:39.457
or they think you're definitely not going to,

124
00:04:39.457 --> 00:04:41.838
which means you still don't know, so there you go.

125

126
00:04:43.321 --> 00:04:45.001

SAM: I remember. It was a really fun episode to shoot,

139
00:05:12.615 --> 00:05:15.426

The experience is absolutely average and as expected.

144
00:05:24.756 --> 00:05:29.571

I love them all so much. The backs are even as cool

If you look at the chibi Beau,

170
00:06:19.847 --> 00:06:21.182
you can see the perforation marks

171
00:06:21.182 --> 00:06:24.023
where you can cut them off, because sleeves are bullshit.

00:06:30.887 --> 00:06:32.368
Those pins are designed by Jenny Park,

177
00:06:32.368 --> 00:06:34.688
and then the backs were designed by Aaron Monroy,

178
00:06:34.688 --> 00:06:36.310
and I mean, they're just so wonderful,

179
00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:39.090
and then we also have our sketchbook

180
00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:41.906
that is for sale right now, and it's pretty cool,

181
00:06:41.906 --> 00:06:43.823
it's leather and there may or may not be

182
00:06:43.823 --> 00:06:46.741
a Captain Tusktooth charm that I may or may not

183
00:06:46.741 --> 00:06:48.569
have had something to do with.

184
00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:50.118
Yay, merch.

185
00:06:50.118 --> 00:06:51.960
(laughter)

186
00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.852
SAM: Back to you, Matt.

187
00:06:53.852 --> 00:06:54.693
TRAVIS: Where are the double guns,

188
00:06:54.693 --> 00:06:55.692
where are the double guns?

189
00:06:55.692 --> 00:06:56.625
OFF-SCREEN: (clicking)

190
00:06:56.625 --> 00:06:59.634
MATT: There we go, that's, all right.

191
00:06:59.634 --> 00:07:00.467
There--

192
00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:02.564
Well-oiled machine.

193
00:07:02.564 --> 00:07:04.114
Anyway.

194
00:07:04.114 --> 00:07:05.813
Thank you guys very much.

195
00:07:05.813 --> 00:07:08.940
I think, that all being said, it's time to go ahead

196
00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:13.416
and jump into tonight's episode of Critical Role.

197
00:07:13.416 --> 00:07:16.348

(dragon roaring)

232
00:08:51.592 --> 00:08:53.144
MATT: And welcome back.

233
00:08:53.144 --> 00:08:54.774
(laughter)

234
00:08:54.774 --> 00:08:56.515
TALIESIN: We deserved that.

235
00:08:56.515 --> 00:08:59.705
MATT: Last we left off, The Mighty Nein,

236
00:08:59.705 --> 00:09:02.520
upon finding, looking, I should say,

237
00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.527
for help in the coming challenges ahead

238
00:09:05.527 --> 00:09:07.278
as Obann seems to grow closer and closer

239
00:09:07.278 --> 00:09:09.720
to whatever his intended goal may be

240
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.478
with the Angel of Irons, you went back to Nicodranas

241
00:09:12.478 --> 00:09:15.713
to Tide Peak Tower and found that Yussa,

242
00:09:15.713 --> 00:09:18.499
the archmage you had befriended earlier in the campaign,

243
00:09:18.499 --> 00:09:20.712
had vanished for now going on three weeks

244
00:09:20.712 --> 00:09:22.707
into the Happy Fun Ball, otherwise known as

245
00:09:22.707 --> 00:09:25.688
the Folding Halls of Halas, or the Archmage Bane,

246
00:09:25.688 --> 00:09:27.368
the Heirloom Sphere.

247
00:09:27.368 --> 00:09:30.794
You called in an ally of his to help,

248
00:09:30.794 --> 00:09:32.818
which turned out to be Arcanist Allura Vysoren

249
00:09:32.818 --> 00:09:34.218
from Tal'Dorei.
LAURA: Yay!

250
00:09:34.218 --> 00:09:35.900
MATT: Who has been acting as your point person

251
00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.130
as you journey into the sphere.

252
00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:40.166
You've made your way through a number of chambers,

253
00:09:40.166 --> 00:09:43.490
using one of the map notes that was left behind by Yussa.

254
00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:46.084
You've battled through the garden. You were chased

255
00:09:46.084 --> 00:09:50.271
by a mage hunter golem across the bent,

256
00:09:50.271 --> 00:09:52.749
physics-strange machine tower

257
00:09:52.749 --> 00:09:55.566
that encompasses these Folding Halls.

258
00:09:55.566 --> 00:09:57.591
You made your way into a golem workshop

259
00:09:57.591 --> 00:10:00.457
and assembled your own tiny golem companion,

260
00:10:00.457 --> 00:10:02.290
which you named Willi.

261
00:10:03.555 --> 00:10:05.604
Which I believe you still have the

262
00:10:05.604 --> 00:10:08.263
attributes for. Perfect.
LIAM: I have the sheet for my friend, yeah.

263
00:10:08.263 --> 00:10:10.501
MATT: Then you stepped into the Experiment Chamber.

264
00:10:10.501 --> 00:10:13.171
Upon entering this room with a dull green light

265
00:10:13.171 --> 00:10:15.827
that suffused the vicinity, the somewhat wet floors,

266
00:10:15.827 --> 00:10:17.646
about an inch of some sort of chemical liquid

267
00:10:17.646 --> 00:10:19.497
that seemed to permeate the entirety

268
00:10:19.497 --> 00:10:21.755
of the base floor line of the chamber.

269
00:10:21.755 --> 00:10:23.150
Chains hanging from the ceiling,

270
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:27.688
some broken, some bowed, seemingly used to move around

271
00:10:27.688 --> 00:10:32.688
about 10 or so of these large glass cases

272
00:10:33.255 --> 00:10:35.293
that are now resting in the center of the chamber,

273
00:10:35.293 --> 00:10:39.432
a few of them jagged, broken, scattered across the floor.

274
00:10:39.432 --> 00:10:41.194
Cracked, and upon inspecting one,

275
00:10:41.194 --> 00:10:43.771
you found a very decomposed corpse inside,

276
00:10:43.771 --> 00:10:46.376
overtaken by some sort of fungus.

277
00:10:46.376 --> 00:10:48.464
As you all were slowing spreading out

278
00:10:48.464 --> 00:10:50.747
into that opening area, Fjord went ahead

279
00:10:50.747 --> 00:10:54.647
to inspect one of three doors to the chamber,

280
00:10:54.647 --> 00:10:57.199
the one closest to you on the left-hand side,

281
00:10:57.199 --> 00:11:02.199
upon which you heard a loud splash immediately to your left.

282
00:11:02.616 --> 00:11:05.771
You turned to see some terrifying sight.

283
00:11:05.771 --> 00:11:08.951
A large, humanoid, hulking beast

284
00:11:08.951 --> 00:11:12.483
of rippling muscles and multitudes of various swollen

285
00:11:12.483 --> 00:11:17.372
or malformed and elongated humanoid arms.

286
00:11:17.372 --> 00:11:19.984
Multiple heads that all seemed to bear

287
00:11:19.984 --> 00:11:23.926
the same glowing amber eyes,

288
00:11:23.926 --> 00:11:28.467
tattered facial hair, and long black hair of Halas himself,

289
00:11:28.467 --> 00:11:31.149
all mashed together into this terrifying beast

290
00:11:31.149 --> 00:11:33.166
as it roared into your face.

291
00:11:33.166 --> 00:11:35.262
Everyone please roll initiative. We're going into battle.

292
00:11:35.262 --> 00:11:36.095
(cheering)

293
00:11:36.095 --> 00:11:37.245
TRAVIS: Let's go get some!

294
00:11:37.245 --> 00:11:39.402
I'm so excited!

295
00:11:39.402 --> 00:11:40.840
Come on, it's ready!

296
00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.831
SAM: Hey, guys.

297
00:11:42.831 --> 00:11:45.598
Get your game ready for Halloween with Dwarven Forge's

298
00:11:45.598 --> 00:11:48.433
classic rosin restock.

299
00:11:48.433 --> 00:11:52.208
The sets included are Catacombs, Den of--

300
00:11:52.208 --> 00:11:54.541
shut up! Catacombs, Den of Evil,

301
00:11:54.541 --> 00:11:57.091
Woodlands, and more. See all the loot available

302
00:11:57.091 --> 00:12:00.349
at dwarvenforge.com. Oh my god, Matt!

303
00:12:00.349 --> 00:12:01.872
TRAVIS: Holy shit!

304
00:12:01.872 --> 00:12:03.889
SAM: Oh my god!

305
00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:06.040
TRAVIS: Are you fucking kidding me right now?

306
00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.190
LAURA: Oh my god.
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

307
00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:10.132
MATT: Fjord, we had over on this side.

308
00:12:10.132 --> 00:12:11.291
TRAVIS: What?!

309
00:12:11.291 --> 00:12:12.423
LAURA: Oh no, no, no.

310
00:12:12.423 --> 00:12:14.503
MATT: Whereabouts are you guys on this side of the chamber?

311
00:12:14.503 --> 00:12:16.459
LAURA: Oh no.
TRAVIS: Oh my god!

312
00:12:16.459 --> 00:12:18.322
LAURA: I think we had just come in, yeah?

313
00:12:18.322 --> 00:12:20.751
Oh wait, no, some people had gone to explore, huh?

314
00:12:20.751 --> 00:12:22.567
MATT: Nott went off to explore--
SAM: I did, I did.

315
00:12:22.567 --> 00:12:24.941
MATT: -- this first piece here.

316
00:12:24.941 --> 00:12:25.843
MARISHA: I don't remember either.

317
00:12:25.843 --> 00:12:28.295
I feel like I was tracing after Fjord?

318
00:12:28.295 --> 00:12:30.214
LAURA: I mean, if Fjord had been in there long enough,

319
00:12:30.214 --> 00:12:32.213
I feel like I would've moved to about here.

320
00:12:32.213 --> 00:12:33.254
MATT: Sure.

321
00:12:33.254 --> 00:12:35.927
I'll say no further than probably this level

322
00:12:35.927 --> 00:12:37.432
for the rest of you who've been waiting

323
00:12:37.432 --> 00:12:38.279
for everyone else to scatter.

324
00:12:38.279 --> 00:12:40.987
SAM: Oh my god.
TRAVIS: There's a table towards them.

325
00:12:40.987 --> 00:12:42.957
LIAM: Where's Willi?

326
00:12:42.957 --> 00:12:43.955
Do we have a Willi?
MATT: Oh, you do.

327
00:12:43.955 --> 00:12:45.038
TRAVIS: Where's Willi?

328
00:12:45.038 --> 00:12:47.323
MATT: Willi is right there.

329
00:12:47.323 --> 00:12:50.140
LAURA: Aww, look that Willi.

330
00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:52.114
MATT: And here's the terrifying creature.

331
00:12:52.114 --> 00:12:54.781
(shouting)

332
00:12:55.997 --> 00:12:56.974
LAURA: Oh god!

333
00:12:56.974 --> 00:12:59.110
TRAVIS: Wow, that is an unfortunate placement for me.

334
00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:00.072
LAURA: Wait, can I pick him up?

335
00:13:00.072 --> 00:13:01.630
MATT: Sure.
LAURA: (shouts)

336
00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:04.243
LIAM: Do I have to roll separately for William, yeah?

337
00:13:04.243 --> 00:13:05.267
MATT: Yes.

338
00:13:05.267 --> 00:13:06.215
LAURA: (shouting)

339
00:13:06.215 --> 00:13:07.771
SAM: Oh my god.
TRAVIS: Oh shit, oh shit.

340
00:13:07.771 --> 00:13:09.566
LAURA: Y'all, we're going to die.

341
00:13:09.566 --> 00:13:11.939
Did I put him back in the right place?

342
00:13:11.939 --> 00:13:15.007
MARISHA: I know, I know, I know.
LAURA: Is that okay?

343
00:13:15.007 --> 00:13:19.168
TRAVIS: We're good, we're good, we're good.

344
00:13:19.168 --> 00:13:20.451
MATT: All righty, so.

345
00:13:20.451 --> 00:13:21.801
MARISHA: What's the plan?

346
00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:23.659
MATT: Everyone rolled initiative?

347
00:13:23.659 --> 00:13:24.792
25 to 20.

348
00:13:24.792 --> 00:13:25.942
MARISHA: 25.

349
00:13:25.942 --> 00:13:27.079
SAM: 25.

350
00:13:27.079 --> 00:13:27.912
MARISHA: Oh!

351
00:13:28.789 --> 00:13:30.380
Yes.
SAM: Off of a natural 20.

352
00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:32.721
MARISHA: Same here!
LAURA: What?!

353
00:13:32.721 --> 00:13:33.674
MATT: Nice!

354
00:13:33.674 --> 00:13:35.497
LIAM: ♪ That fuckin' teamwork ♪

355
00:13:35.497 --> 00:13:37.453
MATT: 20 to 15?

356
00:13:37.453 --> 00:13:38.286
TRAVIS: 16.

357
00:13:38.286 --> 00:13:39.233
LIAM: 17.

358
00:13:39.233 --> 00:13:40.074
MATT: Oh, nice.

359
00:13:40.074 --> 00:13:41.788
TALIESIN: Nice, nice.

360
00:13:41.788 --> 00:13:42.840
Oh no.

361
00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.090
TRAVIS: Caleb, Fjord.

362
00:13:47.077 --> 00:13:48.383
MATT: All righty.

363
00:13:48.383 --> 00:13:49.888
15 to 10?

364
00:13:49.888 --> 00:13:51.113
LAURA and TALIESIN: 13.

365
00:13:51.113 --> 00:13:52.992
TRAVIS: Oh, wow.
MARISHA: Clerics.

366
00:13:52.992 --> 00:13:55.340
SAM: ♪ That's fucking bad luck! ♪

367
00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:56.771
MATT: Those guys just teaming up over here.

368
00:13:56.771 --> 00:13:58.936
All righty, we have...

369
00:13:58.936 --> 00:13:59.834
TALIESIN: Pretty good for clerics.

370
00:13:59.834 --> 00:14:01.175
LAURA: Yeah, that's not bad.
MARISHA: That's good.

371
00:14:01.175 --> 00:14:03.623
TALIESIN: Clerics always go
at the bottom of initiative, anyway.

372
00:14:03.623 --> 00:14:04.456
MARISHA: I think he meant like

373
00:14:04.456 --> 00:14:05.937
unlucky number 13?
MATT: I believe that's everyone--

374
00:14:05.937 --> 00:14:07.956
oh, and what was Willi's?

375
00:14:07.956 --> 00:14:09.937
LIAM: Oh, it was 11.

376
00:14:09.937 --> 00:14:11.220
MATT: 11, Willi.

377
00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:14.440
SAM: Guys, there are other figurines inside those little--

378
00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:15.771
LAURA and TALIESIN: Yeah.

379
00:14:15.771 --> 00:14:17.743
SAM: Like they could come out and kill us.
LAURA: They could be dead.

380
00:14:17.743 --> 00:14:20.697
TALIESIN: Let's try really hard not to hit them.

381
00:14:20.697 --> 00:14:21.531
MATT: All righty.

382
00:14:21.531 --> 00:14:25.962
Top of the combat round, it is Beau and Nott.

383
00:14:25.962 --> 00:14:27.898
SAM: Ladies first, oh wait, I'm a lady.

384
00:14:27.898 --> 00:14:29.651
(laughter)

385
00:14:29.651 --> 00:14:30.547
MATT: Yeah.

386
00:14:30.547 --> 00:14:31.690
SAM: I'm a lady!

387
00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:33.703
MARISHA: Do you want to try some sneak attack round shit?

388
00:14:33.703 --> 00:14:35.061
SAM: Yes!
MARISHA: You can get that anyway.

389
00:14:35.061 --> 00:14:36.521
You go, you go.

390
00:14:36.521 --> 00:14:39.196
SAM: I got this, girl.
MARISHA: All right.

391
00:14:39.196 --> 00:14:40.893
Girl power.

392
00:14:40.893 --> 00:14:44.236
SAM: I'm going to dart into that sort of area,

393
00:14:44.236 --> 00:14:46.935
into the in between space.
MATT: Okay.

394
00:14:46.935 --> 00:14:51.529
SAM: As I run through, I'm going to turn and pew, pew,

395
00:14:51.529 --> 00:14:55.267
shoot at least once at this creature, just once.

396
00:14:55.267 --> 00:14:56.648
MATT: Go for it.

397
00:14:56.648 --> 00:14:58.872
SAM: All right. Natural 20 again.

398
00:14:58.872 --> 00:15:00.205
ALL: Oh!

399
00:15:02.174 --> 00:15:05.149
SAM: Wow, wow, okay, that hits, I assume.

400
00:15:05.149 --> 00:15:07.288
MATT: Go for it, it does hit. (chuckles)

401
00:15:07.288 --> 00:15:08.329
MARISHA: And sneak attack.
LAURA: Ooh!

402
00:15:08.329 --> 00:15:09.162
MARISHA: Come on, come on.

403
00:15:09.162 --> 00:15:12.037
SAM: 16, 18, 20, 23,

404
00:15:12.037 --> 00:15:16.602
plus six is 29 points.

405
00:15:16.602 --> 00:15:17.543
LAURA: Wait, but it's crit, you double it.

406
00:15:17.543 --> 00:15:18.421
MARISHA: Double your dice.

407
00:15:18.421 --> 00:15:19.496
SAM: Oh shit.

408
00:15:19.496 --> 00:15:20.739
TALIESIN: 23.
LAURA: So 23 times--

409
00:15:20.739 --> 00:15:24.376
SAM: So that's 46 plus six is 52.

410
00:15:24.376 --> 00:15:27.457
MATT: 52 points of damage out of the gate.

411
00:15:27.457 --> 00:15:30.513
SAM: Plus, it's a Tinkertop Boltblaster, so on a natural 20,

412
00:15:30.513 --> 00:15:31.604
it just shoots again.

413
00:15:31.604 --> 00:15:32.999
MARISHA: Oh!

414
00:15:32.999 --> 00:15:35.665
SAM: For a 20 to hit.
MATT: That hits.

415
00:15:35.665 --> 00:15:38.314
SAM: Another 11 points of damage.

416
00:15:38.314 --> 00:15:40.290
MATT: Ooh, rogues, man.

417
00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:41.521
SAM: Should I keep going?

418
00:15:41.521 --> 00:15:42.599
LAURA and TRAVIS: Yes!

419
00:15:42.599 --> 00:15:45.425
SAM: All right, I will use my bonus action to attack again.

420
00:15:45.425 --> 00:15:46.808
MATT: Go for it.

421
00:15:46.808 --> 00:15:48.247
SAM: Ooh, 27 to hit.

422
00:15:48.247 --> 00:15:49.163
MATT: That hits.

423
00:15:49.163 --> 00:15:50.455
TRAVIS: Come on!

424
00:15:50.455 --> 00:15:52.481
SAM: Another 10 points of damage, plus I'll do

425
00:15:52.481 --> 00:15:56.402
Fury of the Small, another 20 points of damage.

426
00:15:56.402 --> 00:15:59.055
MATT: So 10th level rogue, opening round,

427
00:15:59.055 --> 00:16:01.958
just throwing it out there, just did 82 points of damage.

428
00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:04.474
TRAVIS: Whoa, fuck!
MATT: First round of combat.

429
00:16:04.474 --> 00:16:05.828
MARISHA: That's hot!
LAURA: That's awesome.

430
00:16:05.828 --> 00:16:06.996
TRAVIS: 10th level?

431
00:16:06.996 --> 00:16:08.351
Shit.
MATT: Yeah.

432
00:16:08.351 --> 00:16:09.330
LAURA: Oh my god, what are you going to do--

433
00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:11.285
SAM: I'm unstoppable!

434
00:16:11.285 --> 00:16:13.412
LAURA: Don't die, you're going to be
so cool when you level up.

435
00:16:13.412 --> 00:16:14.445
SAM: Uh-huh.
MATT: All right,

436
00:16:14.445 --> 00:16:15.278
that finish your turn?

437
00:16:15.278 --> 00:16:17.306
SAM: Yep, that's it.
MATT: Beau.

438
00:16:17.306 --> 00:16:18.581
MARISHA: Okay!

439
00:16:18.581 --> 00:16:20.553
I'm energized now from Nott.

440
00:16:20.553 --> 00:16:24.286
I want to go beep, beep, boop, dope monk shit,

441
00:16:24.286 --> 00:16:26.787
parkour, come down.

442
00:16:26.787 --> 00:16:28.094
TALIESIN: Monk shit.

443
00:16:28.094 --> 00:16:29.877
MARISHA: Forward flip.
SAM: You're doing it.

444
00:16:29.877 --> 00:16:31.218
MATT: Landing where? Here?

445
00:16:31.218 --> 00:16:33.525
MARISHA: Heel to the fucking face, yeah.

446
00:16:33.525 --> 00:16:34.794
LAURA: Which face?

447
00:16:34.794 --> 00:16:36.069
There's three of them!

448
00:16:36.069 --> 00:16:37.638
MATT: Four, technically.
LAURA: There's four of them!

449
00:16:37.638 --> 00:16:40.010
I didn't see that one hiding behind the big one!

450
00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:43.132
MARISHA: I'll go in the epicenter of the faces.

451
00:16:43.132 --> 00:16:44.851
MATT: Okay, which as you rush in the air, you can see

452
00:16:44.851 --> 00:16:46.866
two of them look up at you.

453
00:16:46.866 --> 00:16:50.530
You can see the faces are in different stages of deformity.

454
00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:52.246
One of them has barely human features,

455
00:16:52.246 --> 00:16:53.915
its skull exaggerated and torn,

456
00:16:53.915 --> 00:16:55.303
almost through the flesh in the front,

457
00:16:55.303 --> 00:16:57.271
its teeth broken and jagged out in your direction,

458
00:16:57.271 --> 00:16:59.147
its eyes peering from sunken sockets.

459
00:16:59.147 --> 00:17:02.709
Another one looks mostly human and is just (moans),

460
00:17:02.709 --> 00:17:04.346
moaning as it turns in your direction.

461
00:17:04.346 --> 00:17:05.552
Go ahead and roll your attacks.

462
00:17:05.552 --> 00:17:06.982
MARISHA: Okay.

463
00:17:06.982 --> 00:17:07.922
(panting)

464
00:17:07.922 --> 00:17:11.102
Okay, two attacks, I'm going to do both of them, pop pop.

465
00:17:11.102 --> 00:17:13.864
That's a 25 and 28.

466
00:17:13.864 --> 00:17:14.748
MATT: Both hit.

467
00:17:17.442 --> 00:17:20.024
You guys are rolling awesomely out of the gate here.

468
00:17:20.024 --> 00:17:20.857
SAM: Oh yeah.

469
00:17:20.857 --> 00:17:22.292
MATT: I can only hope to back that up.

470
00:17:22.292 --> 00:17:23.908
TRAVIS: Oh.
MARISHA: Yeah, okay,

471
00:17:23.908 --> 00:17:26.655
that is 11 damage,

472
00:17:26.655 --> 00:17:28.831
and then 10 damage, so 21 damage.

473
00:17:28.831 --> 00:17:30.146
MATT: 21 damage, awesome.

474
00:17:30.146 --> 00:17:31.257
MARISHA: A-Stunning Strike.

475
00:17:31.257 --> 00:17:32.273
MATT: Stunning Strike.
MARISHA: Let's see

476
00:17:32.273 --> 00:17:33.724
this guy's constitution.

477
00:17:33.724 --> 00:17:35.317
MATT: That is a 16.

478
00:17:35.317 --> 00:17:36.718
MARISHA: Goddamn it.

479
00:17:36.718 --> 00:17:37.691
TRAVIS: Are we alone in here?

480
00:17:37.691 --> 00:17:39.561
That's the important question.

481
00:17:39.561 --> 00:17:41.129
MARISHA: Why is it always 16?
TRAVIS: With the light

482
00:17:41.129 --> 00:17:43.170
from the sword that's up, can we see to--

483
00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:44.073
MATT: I'm rolling different numbers, but they have

484
00:17:44.073 --> 00:17:45.492
different constitution bonuses.

485
00:17:45.492 --> 00:17:46.331
TRAVIS: The heads?!

486
00:17:46.331 --> 00:17:47.456
MATT: No, meaning like the different things

487
00:17:47.456 --> 00:17:48.512
I've rolled recently.

488
00:17:48.512 --> 00:17:49.809
But they always seem to be hitting that 16.

489
00:17:49.809 --> 00:17:52.810
MARISHA: I know, but it's always like right above my--

490
00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:55.075
Why aren't you working? There we go.

491
00:17:55.075 --> 00:17:57.008
MATT: You still have your bonus action.

492
00:17:57.008 --> 00:18:00.276
MARISHA: Bonus action, I'm right in front of it, yeah?

493
00:18:00.276 --> 00:18:02.603
MATT: You and Fjord are both hitting it

494
00:18:02.603 --> 00:18:06.186
from the right and left angles of its body.

495
00:18:07.853 --> 00:18:09.543
TRAVIS: (clears throat)

496
00:18:09.543 --> 00:18:11.049
MARISHA: It would be super awesome if I could

497
00:18:11.049 --> 00:18:12.847
stun him out of the gate, so--

498
00:18:12.847 --> 00:18:14.893
MATT: Caleb, it is your turn next.

499
00:18:14.893 --> 00:18:18.683
MARISHA: Flurry of Blows. I'm going to duck down

500
00:18:18.683 --> 00:18:21.255
and go for ribcage shots.

501
00:18:21.255 --> 00:18:25.338
MATT: Go for it, roll for an attack on the third one.

502
00:18:26.662 --> 00:18:28.179
MARISHA: Natural 20.

503
00:18:28.179 --> 00:18:30.382
TRAVIS: Oh!

504
00:18:30.382 --> 00:18:32.107
Oh shit!

505
00:18:33.146 --> 00:18:35.491
(laughter)

506
00:18:35.491 --> 00:18:36.869
MARISHA: Garbage, garbage dice roll.

507
00:18:36.869 --> 00:18:38.358
MATT: It's going to be real funny if I spent so much time

508
00:18:38.358 --> 00:18:39.876
on this battlefield and you guys finish it

509
00:18:39.876 --> 00:18:40.784
in like three rounds.

510
00:18:40.784 --> 00:18:43.359
MARISHA: 10 damage. A-Stunning Strike.

511
00:18:45.702 --> 00:18:47.992
TRAVIS: How much damage on that crit?

512
00:18:47.992 --> 00:18:50.546
MARISHA: 10, I rolled a two.
MATT: 15?

513
00:18:50.546 --> 00:18:52.218
MARISHA: 15 is my save.

514
00:18:52.218 --> 00:18:53.337
MATT: Sorry.

515
00:18:53.337 --> 00:18:54.170
LAURA: Ugh!

516
00:18:55.462 --> 00:18:58.325
MARISHA: Okay, second hit.

517
00:18:58.325 --> 00:18:59.428
No, 12.

518
00:18:59.428 --> 00:19:00.261
MATT: 12 misses.

519
00:19:00.261 --> 00:19:01.629
LAURA: What controls that save?

520
00:19:01.629 --> 00:19:03.138
Is it dexterity?
MATT: Wisdom.

521
00:19:03.138 --> 00:19:04.888
LAURA: Wisdom, okay.
MATT: Yes.

522
00:19:06.791 --> 00:19:09.484
Two close calls for the creature on that one.

523
00:19:09.484 --> 00:19:10.577
Does that finish your turn?

524
00:19:10.577 --> 00:19:12.045
MARISHA: Uh-huh.
MATT: Caleb, you're up.

525
00:19:12.045 --> 00:19:14.151
LIAM: Caleb is walking in this direction

526
00:19:14.151 --> 00:19:16.550
to try to get close to maybe this green door

527
00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:19.405
to get away from this big disgusting man.

528
00:19:19.405 --> 00:19:21.776
MATT: This way, you mean?
LIAM: Yeah, and as he's doing it, iron--

529
00:19:21.776 --> 00:19:24.442
SAM: It's just Caduceus.
LIAM: -- powder between his hands spreads out

530
00:19:24.442 --> 00:19:27.202
and he yanks his hands apart, and Beauregard

531
00:19:27.202 --> 00:19:29.557
shunks up to twice her size in the room.

532
00:19:29.557 --> 00:19:30.733
SAM: Ooh, Swoleregard.

533
00:19:30.733 --> 00:19:31.700
MARISHA: Ooh.

534
00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:32.882
LAURA: (laughs)

535
00:19:32.882 --> 00:19:35.663
MARISHA: It took a second to catch what you were saying.

536
00:19:35.663 --> 00:19:36.633
Oh, me.

537
00:19:36.633 --> 00:19:37.713
TRAVIS: Maybe we should talk to him.

538
00:19:37.713 --> 00:19:39.024
LAURA: Holy--!

539
00:19:39.024 --> 00:19:40.983
MARISHA: Which one, which head?

540
00:19:40.983 --> 00:19:42.827
MATT: (chuckling)

541
00:19:42.827 --> 00:19:44.736
LIAM: Am I able to look around quickly to make sure

542
00:19:44.736 --> 00:19:48.078
that there's nothing over in this corner to eat me?

543
00:19:48.078 --> 00:19:50.970
MATT: Make a passing perception check.

544
00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:52.496
MARISHA: Oh.

545
00:19:52.496 --> 00:19:53.762
Extract Aspects.

546
00:19:54.909 --> 00:19:56.034
MATT: Oh, yes.

547
00:19:56.034 --> 00:19:57.123
LIAM: 17 on perception.

548
00:19:57.123 --> 00:19:58.855
MARISHA: Before we get too far away. Sorry.

549
00:19:58.855 --> 00:20:00.498
MATT: That's fair enough. You got to remember that.

550
00:20:00.498 --> 00:20:03.463
It is immune to lightning and poison,

551
00:20:03.463 --> 00:20:05.054
as well as bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing

552
00:20:05.054 --> 00:20:07.273
from nonmagical weapons that aren't adamantine.

553
00:20:07.273 --> 00:20:08.812
MARISHA: Okay, I just shout out--

554
00:20:08.812 --> 00:20:11.443
MATT: Also, it's immune to being charmed, exhausted,

555
00:20:11.443 --> 00:20:13.331
frightened, paralyzed, petrified, or poisoned.

556
00:20:13.331 --> 00:20:15.115
(gasping)

557
00:20:15.115 --> 00:20:17.252
LIAM: Wow, you learned a lot from that punch.

558
00:20:17.252 --> 00:20:19.292
TRAVIS: What was the first half of that shit?

559
00:20:19.292 --> 00:20:23.002
MARISHA: Lightning and poison, right?

560
00:20:23.002 --> 00:20:24.009
MATT: Yeah.

561
00:20:24.009 --> 00:20:27.925
MARISHA: Lightning and poison, nonmagical weapons,

562
00:20:27.925 --> 00:20:32.892
and basically anything like mind-related.

563
00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:38.505
So I shout out: Avoid-- huh?

564
00:20:38.505 --> 00:20:40.564
MATT: Except for not stunned.
MARISHA: Huh?

565
00:20:40.564 --> 00:20:41.996
MATT: It is not immune to stun.

566
00:20:41.996 --> 00:20:43.380
MARISHA: It is not immune to stun.

567
00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:44.213
That's great.

568
00:20:44.213 --> 00:20:48.321
So I shout out: Avoid lightning and poison and, like,

569
00:20:48.321 --> 00:20:50.830
body shit.
MATT: Okay.

570
00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:52.124
TRAVIS: "Body shit."

571
00:20:52.124 --> 00:20:55.180
SAM: Avoid body shit?
MARISHA: Yeah!

572
00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:57.097
I'm trying to get it out in six seconds.

573
00:20:57.097 --> 00:20:58.312
TRAVIS: Is that the end of your turn, Caleb?

574
00:20:58.312 --> 00:21:00.577
LIAM: That is the end of my turn.
TRAVIS: Okay.

575
00:21:00.577 --> 00:21:05.577
I will use my bonus action to cast Hexblade's Curse

576
00:21:06.214 --> 00:21:07.777
on this piece of shit.

577
00:21:07.777 --> 00:21:09.011
MATT: You got it.

578
00:21:09.011 --> 00:21:10.778
Hexblade's Curse.

579
00:21:13.733 --> 00:21:18.733
I will take two swings with the Star Razor.

580
00:21:19.068 --> 00:21:20.318
MATT: Do it.

581
00:21:21.846 --> 00:21:23.403
Where's the Hexblade's Curse one?

582
00:21:23.403 --> 00:21:24.866
Someone's been messing with my stuff.

583
00:21:24.866 --> 00:21:25.966
SAM: Uh-oh.
MATT: That's all right.

584
00:21:25.966 --> 00:21:28.386
Well, we'll use that as the curse, so you know it's there.

585
00:21:29.228 --> 00:21:30.561
TRAVIS: A 19 and a 20.

586
00:21:31.979 --> 00:21:32.973
MATT: 19 and a 20.

587
00:21:32.973 --> 00:21:34.059
Both hit.

588
00:21:34.059 --> 00:21:35.469
TRAVIS: Beautiful.

589
00:21:35.469 --> 00:21:36.469
First one...

590
00:21:39.936 --> 00:21:44.744
That is a 14 plus four

591
00:21:44.744 --> 00:21:46.194
for the Hexblade's Curse,

592
00:21:46.194 --> 00:21:48.085
so 18 on the first.

593
00:21:48.085 --> 00:21:49.844
MATT: All righty, nice.

594
00:21:49.844 --> 00:21:53.446
TRAVIS: And 12, four, 16 on the second.

595
00:21:53.446 --> 00:21:55.209
MATT: 16, oof.

596
00:21:55.209 --> 00:21:57.520
He's already looking hurt. (laughs)

597
00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:58.353
SAM: Oh, what?

598
00:21:58.353 --> 00:22:00.540
MATT: As you're carving through, he hasn't even gone yet,

599
00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:02.284
and you guys...

600
00:22:02.284 --> 00:22:03.549
(laughter)

601
00:22:03.549 --> 00:22:04.912
You guys are now carving into his flesh.

602
00:22:04.912 --> 00:22:06.867
You can see as the parts of flesh open up from underneath,

603
00:22:06.867 --> 00:22:09.737
you can see bone exposed that doesn't make sense

604
00:22:09.737 --> 00:22:11.624
for an internal skeleton.

605
00:22:11.624 --> 00:22:13.469
Elements of bone that are just floating

606
00:22:13.469 --> 00:22:15.590
or are attached in ways that don't make sense.

607
00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:17.181
The physicality of this creature is wild,

608
00:22:17.181 --> 00:22:19.466
and horrifying, to be honest.

609
00:22:19.466 --> 00:22:21.880
But you're exposing elements of its interior body,

610
00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:22.989
and you can see elements of its flesh

611
00:22:22.989 --> 00:22:24.871
are starting to mend a little bit,

612
00:22:24.871 --> 00:22:27.060
and you could almost see semblances of teeth

613
00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:29.864
at the corner of some of these wounds.

614
00:22:29.864 --> 00:22:31.104
TRAVIS: Oh no.
SAM: Teeth?

615
00:22:31.104 --> 00:22:32.101
MATT: Does that finish your turn?

616
00:22:32.101 --> 00:22:33.450
LAURA: Oh no.

617
00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:35.632
MARISHA: It's totally a baby Laughing Hand, right?

618
00:22:35.632 --> 00:22:37.211
Or something like that?
LIAM: Or related.

619
00:22:37.211 --> 00:22:38.044
MARISHA: Yeah.

620
00:22:38.044 --> 00:22:40.547
TRAVIS: If I move, and he tries to hit me with an attack

621
00:22:40.547 --> 00:22:43.256
of opportunity, can you use Sentinel against him?

622
00:22:43.256 --> 00:22:44.089
MARISHA: Sorry?

623
00:22:44.089 --> 00:22:45.461
Yes, if what, sorry?

624
00:22:45.461 --> 00:22:47.281
TRAVIS: If I move and it provokes an attack of opportunity,

625
00:22:47.281 --> 00:22:48.609
can you use Sentinel against him?
MARISHA: Yes, I can.

626
00:22:48.609 --> 00:22:49.534
TRAVIS: It won't prohibit the

627
00:22:49.534 --> 00:22:50.888
attack of opportunity, though, right?

628
00:22:50.888 --> 00:22:52.054
He'll still take it.
MARISHA: Yeah.

629
00:22:52.054 --> 00:22:53.439
MATT: He'll still take it, but she gets to hit him.

630
00:22:53.439 --> 00:22:54.379
MARISHA: But I get to hit him

631
00:22:54.379 --> 00:22:57.835
and potentially keep him from moving.

632
00:22:57.835 --> 00:22:59.910
TRAVIS: Yeah, fuck it. I'm going to back up,

633
00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:01.426
I'm just going to literally see Beau,

634
00:23:01.426 --> 00:23:05.111
huge behind me, and be like: Right behind you!

635
00:23:05.111 --> 00:23:07.469
MARISHA: I'm going to let him duck under,

636
00:23:07.469 --> 00:23:08.919
and let this guy follow him,

637
00:23:08.919 --> 00:23:10.090
and then, like, closeline him.

638
00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:11.090
MATT: Okay, as you swing underneath,

639
00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:12.719
you can see the large bulky arms, one that's like,

640
00:23:12.719 --> 00:23:13.953
pressed up against the slick wall,

641
00:23:13.953 --> 00:23:15.580
and the other one that's hulking towards

642
00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:16.750
like a gorilla arm.

643
00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:18.906
One of the tiny longer thin ones (whooshes)

644
00:23:18.906 --> 00:23:21.929
shoots out towards Fjord.

645
00:23:21.929 --> 00:23:23.569
That is going to be a 23 to hit.

646
00:23:23.569 --> 00:23:24.859
TRAVIS: That definitely hits.

647
00:23:24.859 --> 00:23:27.163
MATT: It does no damage, but you are consider grappled.

648
00:23:27.163 --> 00:23:29.449
TRAVIS: Oh.
MATT: So you do not move.

649
00:23:29.449 --> 00:23:30.619
TRAVIS: Okay.

650
00:23:30.619 --> 00:23:35.390
He takes three points of damage from the Star Razor.

651
00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:36.456
Radiant.

652
00:23:36.456 --> 00:23:37.665
MATT: While you are grappled, you are also

653
00:23:37.665 --> 00:23:39.280
considered restrained.
TRAVIS: Okay.

654
00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:40.351
MATT: Which means you have to make an action

655
00:23:40.351 --> 00:23:41.825
to make a strength check to try and break free.

656
00:23:41.825 --> 00:23:42.942
TRAVIS: Got it, before my turn?

657
00:23:42.942 --> 00:23:44.233
MATT: Yeah. You taking your attack?

658
00:23:44.233 --> 00:23:45.066
MARISHA: Yep.

659
00:23:46.208 --> 00:23:48.861
Natural 20.
MATT: Damn!

660
00:23:48.861 --> 00:23:50.460
TRAVIS: Shit, look at that.
TALIESIN: About time.

661
00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:53.360
MATT: Yeah, no, sure.
SAM: Wow!

662
00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:54.433
TALIESIN: About time.
MATT: Okay.

663
00:23:54.433 --> 00:23:56.558
MARISHA: Swoleregard!
TRAVIS: Let's go, beast mode!

664
00:23:56.558 --> 00:23:58.446
MARISHA: I just clothesline the fuck out of him.

665
00:23:58.446 --> 00:23:59.279
TRAVIS: Fifth gear!

666
00:23:59.279 --> 00:24:00.518
MARISHA: Ooh, yes!

667
00:24:00.518 --> 00:24:01.642
TRAVIS: (clucks like a chicken)

668
00:24:01.642 --> 00:24:05.910
MARISHA: That is 18 plus six, 20, 18 plus six?

669
00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:07.667
LIAM: 24.
MARISHA: 24 damage!

670
00:24:07.667 --> 00:24:09.659
MATT: Damn.

671
00:24:09.659 --> 00:24:10.492
MARISHA: Crack!

672
00:24:11.649 --> 00:24:14.377
A little bait and switch, a little juke for ya.

673
00:24:14.377 --> 00:24:15.752
MATT: You got it.
MARISHA: A little--

674
00:24:15.752 --> 00:24:18.285
MATT: Now, as opposed to like hitting for the heads,

675
00:24:18.285 --> 00:24:20.463
you're its size, if not a little bit larger,

676
00:24:20.463 --> 00:24:22.530
and as you club across the front,

677
00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:25.174
one of the heads snaps, the neck breaking.

678
00:24:25.174 --> 00:24:26.366
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Ooh.

679
00:24:26.366 --> 00:24:28.072
MATT: That finishes your attack?

680
00:24:28.072 --> 00:24:29.907
MARISHA: Yes, and he can't move now, he is--

681
00:24:29.907 --> 00:24:31.521
MATT: Well, technically no.

682
00:24:31.521 --> 00:24:33.372
It's only when you hit him as an attack of opportunity

683
00:24:33.372 --> 00:24:35.205
as he's moving that you reduce his speed to zero.

684
00:24:35.205 --> 00:24:36.765
The attack that you just took as a Sentinel one

685
00:24:36.765 --> 00:24:37.886
is just a free attack.

686
00:24:37.886 --> 00:24:39.017
So he still has his movement.

687
00:24:39.017 --> 00:24:39.958
TRAVIS: Sorry, sorry.

688
00:24:39.958 --> 00:24:41.025
MATT: It's okay.
TRAVIS: My fault.

689
00:24:41.025 --> 00:24:42.230
MARISHA: No, it's mine.

690
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:43.416
MATT: Live and learn.

691
00:24:43.416 --> 00:24:44.249
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

692
00:24:44.249 --> 00:24:46.831
MATT: It is now the creature's turn.
LAURA: Oh god.

693
00:24:46.831 --> 00:24:49.943
MATT: You watch that broken neck snap back into place

694
00:24:49.943 --> 00:24:52.860
with this horrible sickening (cracking) sound.

695
00:24:54.191 --> 00:24:57.056
It's going to go ahead and--

696
00:24:57.056 --> 00:24:59.258
MARISHA: It's going to do some like, la la la la la.

697
00:24:59.258 --> 00:25:04.214
MATT: It's going to spider climb up into the chains above.

698
00:25:04.214 --> 00:25:05.674
SAM: Wait, why is Fjord going with him?

699
00:25:05.674 --> 00:25:07.011
LAURA: Because Fjord's attached, he got grappled!

700
00:25:07.011 --> 00:25:08.639
LIAM: He got him in his baby hand, his baby arms got him.

701
00:25:08.639 --> 00:25:10.587
LAURA: His little baby arm?

702
00:25:10.587 --> 00:25:13.590
MATT: Lands here, knocks one of the glass canisters

703
00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:18.590
off the side, which shatters onto the ground.

704
00:25:18.762 --> 00:25:20.750
After taking the hit from you earlier,

705
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:23.070
it seems to be a little wary of you.

706
00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:26.048
So on its turn, it's going to make its six melee attacks.

707
00:25:26.048 --> 00:25:26.974
(gasping)

708
00:25:26.974 --> 00:25:27.823
SAM: On me?!

709
00:25:27.823 --> 00:25:29.331
TRAVIS: I'm so sorry. I thought you said six.

710
00:25:29.331 --> 00:25:30.180
MATT: Yeah.

711
00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:32.095
Has a lot of things to attack with.

712
00:25:32.095 --> 00:25:33.303
TALIESIN: Ooh.
SAM: Oh boy.

713
00:25:34.445 --> 00:25:35.743
MATT: First it's going to attempt a grab attack

714
00:25:35.743 --> 00:25:38.305
against you, Nott.

715
00:25:38.305 --> 00:25:41.213
That's going to be a 15.

716
00:25:41.213 --> 00:25:42.758
SAM: To hit?
MATT: To hit.

717
00:25:42.758 --> 00:25:43.631
SAM: Does not hit.

718
00:25:43.631 --> 00:25:45.275
MATT: It's going to make a second grab attack on you.

719
00:25:45.275 --> 00:25:47.178
That is going to be a 27.

720
00:25:47.178 --> 00:25:48.070
SAM: Hits.
TRAVIS: Wow!

721
00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:50.392
MATT: Okay, you are grappled and considered restrained.

722
00:25:50.392 --> 00:25:51.225
SAM: Okay.

723
00:25:51.225 --> 00:25:53.800
MATT: Now two of the arms are now grabbing and holding on,

724
00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:58.390
Nott and Fjord, and you guys are like, being held to it.

725
00:25:58.390 --> 00:25:59.518
That's two of its attacks, it's now going to make--

726
00:25:59.518 --> 00:26:00.945
TRAVIS: It swung with a 27 to hit.

727
00:26:00.945 --> 00:26:04.024
MATT: It's going to make a bite attack against you, Fjord.

728
00:26:04.024 --> 00:26:05.115
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.
MATT: Actually no,

729
00:26:05.115 --> 00:26:05.948
it's going to make it against you,

730
00:26:05.948 --> 00:26:07.565
since it just pulled you in, it's actually going to pull you

731
00:26:07.565 --> 00:26:09.104
towards one of the large swollen heads,

732
00:26:09.104 --> 00:26:11.007
the jaws open up wide.

733
00:26:11.007 --> 00:26:13.794
SAM: Because I'm restrained, does it have advantage on it?

734
00:26:13.794 --> 00:26:15.211
MATT: It does.
SAM: Okay.

735
00:26:16.209 --> 00:26:17.042
MARISHA: You're getting eaten.

736
00:26:17.042 --> 00:26:19.635
MATT: Which is good, that brings us to 21.

737
00:26:19.635 --> 00:26:20.759
SAM: Hits.
LAURA: No.

738
00:26:20.759 --> 00:26:21.774
MATT: All righty.

739
00:26:21.774 --> 00:26:22.840
You suffer...

740
00:26:25.184 --> 00:26:26.517
Get my d4s here.

741
00:26:32.901 --> 00:26:34.162
TALIESIN: I don't know, yeah, sorry.

742
00:26:34.162 --> 00:26:35.630
TRAVIS: This is fucking awesome, this is awesome!

743
00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:37.196
MARISHA: No, you did good.
LIAM: Yeah, I grew you.

744
00:26:37.196 --> 00:26:38.464
MARISHA: You grew me.

745
00:26:38.464 --> 00:26:40.130
MATT: You take 20 points of piercing damage

746
00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:42.327
as it just bites into your body, and you're

747
00:26:42.327 --> 00:26:44.072
hanging from the jaw now as part of your being

748
00:26:44.072 --> 00:26:45.675
held and restrained.

749
00:26:45.675 --> 00:26:48.934
You can see tiny Nott now being like chewed in this awful

750
00:26:48.934 --> 00:26:51.078
mutated Halas face.

751
00:26:51.078 --> 00:26:53.672
SAM: I'll do Uncanny Dodge and reduce it to 10.

752
00:26:53.672 --> 00:26:56.361
MATT: Okay, go for it.

753
00:26:56.361 --> 00:26:58.171
Because you're dodging out of its maneuver,

754
00:26:58.171 --> 00:26:59.773
it's going to do the rest of the attacks on you.

755
00:26:59.773 --> 00:27:01.877
SAM: Great, cool. Cool, great.

756
00:27:01.877 --> 00:27:03.391
MATT: That's going to be three more attacks against you.

757
00:27:03.391 --> 00:27:05.266
They're all slam attacks, as you're like in its mouth,

758
00:27:05.266 --> 00:27:07.260
it starts like pummeling you in the jaw

759
00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:08.719
and clawing across you.

760
00:27:08.719 --> 00:27:11.523
With advantage, that is 22 to hit?

761
00:27:11.523 --> 00:27:12.356
SAM: Yes.

762
00:27:16.273 --> 00:27:17.449
MATT: 18 to hit?

763
00:27:17.449 --> 00:27:18.816
SAM: Armor class is 18.
MATT: That hits.

764
00:27:18.816 --> 00:27:19.775
SAM: Yeah.

765
00:27:19.775 --> 00:27:23.170
MATT: And 23 to hit.
SAM: Hits.

766
00:27:23.170 --> 00:27:25.325
MATT: So all three hit you.

767
00:27:25.325 --> 00:27:26.158
SAM: Ooh, ah, ooh.

768
00:27:26.158 --> 00:27:29.432
TRAVIS: All right, we're going to have to [inaudible].

769
00:27:33.626 --> 00:27:35.427
Oh boy.

770
00:27:35.427 --> 00:27:36.427
I'm excited.

771
00:27:37.597 --> 00:27:39.258
MATT: Take 39 points of bludgeoning damage.

772
00:27:39.258 --> 00:27:40.341
TALIESIN and SAM: Cool.

773
00:27:42.322 --> 00:27:45.150
MATT: Then it's going to use--

774
00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:46.521
LAURA: It's got more?

775
00:27:46.521 --> 00:27:48.479
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's got one more.
SAM: Legendary actions.

776
00:27:48.479 --> 00:27:50.591
MATT: No no, it was two grapple attempts, a bite,

777
00:27:50.591 --> 00:27:51.447
and then three bludgeoning attacks,

778
00:27:51.447 --> 00:27:52.692
that's all of its attacks.

779
00:27:52.692 --> 00:27:54.059
TRAVIS: Okay.

780
00:27:54.059 --> 00:27:55.442
Oh right, five.
MATT: It's going to stay where it is, actually,

781
00:27:55.442 --> 00:27:58.264
hiding amongst these glass vials.

782
00:27:58.264 --> 00:28:00.590
It's giving itself a little bit of cover

783
00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:01.607
from ranged attacks.

784
00:28:01.607 --> 00:28:04.381
TRAVIS: Did anything happen from the
tube that got knocked over?

785
00:28:04.381 --> 00:28:05.716
MATT: Nothing that you see.
TRAVIS: (whines)

786
00:28:05.716 --> 00:28:07.910
MATT: Other than more liquid spilling on the ground.

787
00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:10.277
It was already cracked open before it got pushed over,

788
00:28:10.277 --> 00:28:12.965
and you don't have a view of what's inside of it.

789
00:28:12.965 --> 00:28:14.817
That's going to end its turn, actually.

790
00:28:14.817 --> 00:28:17.306
That brings us to Caduceus and Jester.

791
00:28:17.306 --> 00:28:18.914
LAURA: You want to go first?

792
00:28:18.914 --> 00:28:20.595
TALIESIN: Sure, I'll go first.

793
00:28:20.595 --> 00:28:25.347
I'm going to try and get a clear shot on this thing.

794
00:28:25.347 --> 00:28:26.963
How much do I have to move?

795
00:28:26.963 --> 00:28:29.687
Then I'm going to--
MATT: Sorry, you did watch its wounds

796
00:28:29.687 --> 00:28:31.107
slightly mend a little bit.

797
00:28:31.107 --> 00:28:33.448
TRAVIS: Goddamn it.
TALIESIN: Yep.

798
00:28:33.448 --> 00:28:35.756
Yeah, I'm going to find a clear shot on this thing,

799
00:28:35.756 --> 00:28:37.787
and then I'm going to back up into one of the corners

800
00:28:37.787 --> 00:28:40.002
as far away from all the shit as possible.

801
00:28:40.002 --> 00:28:41.340
But to start with, I'm going to hit it

802
00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:42.921
with a Ray of Enfeeblement.

803
00:28:42.921 --> 00:28:43.874
MATT: Ray of Enfeeblement.

804
00:28:43.874 --> 00:28:46.591
Is that a saving throw or an attack roll?

805
00:28:46.591 --> 00:28:48.846
TALIESIN: That's a save.

806
00:28:48.846 --> 00:28:50.099
MATT: A save, what is the save on that one?

807
00:28:50.099 --> 00:28:51.207
TALIESIN: Constitution 17.

808
00:28:51.207 --> 00:28:52.974
MATT: Constitution 17.

809
00:28:55.423 --> 00:28:58.198
That is going to be a 15.

810
00:28:58.198 --> 00:28:59.108
LAURA: Oh!

811
00:28:59.108 --> 00:29:02.021
TALIESIN: All of its attacks that are strength-based,

812
00:29:02.021 --> 00:29:03.601
the damage is halved.

813
00:29:03.601 --> 00:29:04.889
MATT: (scoffs)

814
00:29:04.889 --> 00:29:07.445
(laughter)

815
00:29:07.445 --> 00:29:09.003
TRAVIS: Fucking Caduceus!

816
00:29:09.003 --> 00:29:10.513
LAURA: That noise, I like that noise.

817
00:29:10.513 --> 00:29:13.281
TALIESIN: Now I'm going to back up into that corner

818
00:29:13.281 --> 00:29:14.625
as far away from this as humanly possible.

819
00:29:14.625 --> 00:29:15.473
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: That's the way.

820
00:29:15.473 --> 00:29:16.731
TALIESIN: Yep.

821
00:29:16.731 --> 00:29:18.462
And that's my turn.

822
00:29:18.462 --> 00:29:19.897
SAM: Hey, that was great!
TRAVIS: Wow!

823
00:29:19.897 --> 00:29:22.367
LAURA: That was really good, Caduceus!
TALIESIN: Yeah.

824
00:29:22.367 --> 00:29:26.600
LAURA: While he was doing that,
I was going to run over here,

825
00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:28.066
to where I can get a good view.

826
00:29:28.066 --> 00:29:29.488
Can I see him from here?

827
00:29:29.488 --> 00:29:30.449
Yeah.

828
00:29:30.449 --> 00:29:31.455
MATT: You can see him.

829
00:29:31.455 --> 00:29:32.703
LAURA: I can see him.

830
00:29:32.703 --> 00:29:33.536
Okay.

831
00:29:34.387 --> 00:29:39.387
I'm going to Guiding Bolt him.

832
00:29:40.105 --> 00:29:41.364
MATT: Okay.

833
00:29:41.364 --> 00:29:43.417
LAURA: At 3rd-level.

834
00:29:43.417 --> 00:29:44.883
MATT: Go for it.

835
00:29:44.883 --> 00:29:46.544
TRAVIS: 3rd-level.
SAM: Don't hit me!

836
00:29:46.544 --> 00:29:48.186
MATT: He does have three-quarters cover,
just so you're aware.

837
00:29:48.186 --> 00:29:51.025
LAURA: Oh, well, can I get up somewhere to where I can

838
00:29:51.025 --> 00:29:53.806
get out of the three-quarters cover?

839
00:29:53.806 --> 00:29:55.611
MATT: Where do you want to maneuver?

840
00:29:55.611 --> 00:29:57.993
LAURA: If I like, ran up the stairs, would I be able to--

841
00:29:57.993 --> 00:30:00.282
MATT: To there? He would have half-cover then.

842
00:30:00.282 --> 00:30:01.115
LAURA: Okay.

843
00:30:01.115 --> 00:30:02.536
MATT: He went there specifically to defend himself.

844
00:30:02.536 --> 00:30:03.580
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

845
00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:05.204
SAM: Don't hit me!

846
00:30:06.654 --> 00:30:08.329
TALIESIN: Hit me, is that what I heard?

847
00:30:08.329 --> 00:30:09.766
SAM: (grunts) Hit me!

848
00:30:09.766 --> 00:30:10.599
LAURA: That's 17?

849
00:30:10.599 --> 00:30:11.666
MATT: 17 misses.

850
00:30:11.666 --> 00:30:12.750
LAURA: Cool, cool, cool.

851
00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:14.947
MATT: The bolt strikes by. You can see it lighting up

852
00:30:14.947 --> 00:30:16.942
the various glass tubes as it streaks out,

853
00:30:16.942 --> 00:30:18.669
the creature ducks out of the way,

854
00:30:18.669 --> 00:30:20.980
and you see it just pass between the tangled mass

855
00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:22.447
of arms and limbs.

856
00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:24.579
LAURA: Hold on.
TRAVIS: Is it saying--

857
00:30:24.579 --> 00:30:27.640
I mean, is it speaking any language or emitting any sound?

858
00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:29.834
MATT: In your proximity, it's making all sorts of sounds.

859
00:30:29.834 --> 00:30:31.356
Every head has been making its own different

860
00:30:31.356 --> 00:30:32.267
weirdly pitched voice.

861
00:30:32.267 --> 00:30:34.228
One of them's a chattering (chittering),

862
00:30:34.228 --> 00:30:36.775
one of them is this low sucking (inhaling),

863
00:30:36.775 --> 00:30:41.072
the almost completely formed human head is going (moaning).

864
00:30:41.072 --> 00:30:43.881
They're all just this awful mixture

865
00:30:43.881 --> 00:30:46.076
of different voices and sounds, and you're like,

866
00:30:46.076 --> 00:30:47.434
held up right against it.

867
00:30:47.434 --> 00:30:50.667
TRAVIS: No, no-no, no-no!
MATT: The flesh is slick and dripping, yeah.

868
00:30:50.667 --> 00:30:52.686
LAURA: I'm going to, for the rest of my turn,

869
00:30:52.686 --> 00:30:54.898
just jump down here and like hide.

870
00:30:54.898 --> 00:30:56.223
MATT: Okay, you got it.

871
00:30:56.223 --> 00:30:57.520
It is now Willi's go.

872
00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:58.429
SAM: (chuckling)

873
00:30:58.429 --> 00:30:59.262
LIAM: <i>Ja.</i>
TALIESIN: Hey!

874
00:30:59.262 --> 00:31:03.251
LIAM: Telepathically, I summon Willi to me to protect me.

875
00:31:03.251 --> 00:31:04.726
<i>Hilf mir.</i>

876
00:31:04.726 --> 00:31:07.039
MATT: What's his movement? Is it 40?

877
00:31:07.039 --> 00:31:10.194
LIAM: 30, so I'd like him to go right in front of me here,

878
00:31:10.194 --> 00:31:12.785
and hold his action to pummel anything

879
00:31:12.785 --> 00:31:15.617
that gets up on me and tries to hurt me.

880
00:31:15.617 --> 00:31:16.973
MATT: You got it.
TRAVIS: Dances up on me.

881
00:31:16.973 --> 00:31:19.415
MATT: Cool. That finishes your turn-- or Willi's turn.

882
00:31:19.415 --> 00:31:21.139
Beau and Nott, you guys are up.

883
00:31:21.139 --> 00:31:22.212
SAM: What?

884
00:31:22.212 --> 00:31:26.040
LAURA: Kill him since none [inaudible].

885
00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:27.838
SAM: How do I get out of this?

886
00:31:27.838 --> 00:31:29.792
MATT: You have to spend an action to try and escape.

887
00:31:29.792 --> 00:31:31.230
LAURA: Oh yeah, to disengage.

888
00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:34.353
SAM: Or I could attack, no, while I'm restrained.

889
00:31:34.353 --> 00:31:35.208
MATT: You can attack,

890
00:31:35.208 --> 00:31:37.052
you just have disadvantage on your attacks.

891
00:31:37.052 --> 00:31:40.427
SAM: I probably can't move my crossbow around.

892
00:31:40.427 --> 00:31:41.723
MATT: You probably could, since you have

893
00:31:41.723 --> 00:31:43.766
the Crossbow Expert feat, you can do it at point blank

894
00:31:43.766 --> 00:31:45.629
and it's not a problem.

895
00:31:45.629 --> 00:31:46.579
MARISHA: Unless you want me to try and go first.

896
00:31:46.579 --> 00:31:48.467
MATT: Was it Crossbow Expert, or it's the other one?

897
00:31:48.467 --> 00:31:49.300
TRAVIS: Try farting.

898
00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:50.910
(laughter)

899
00:31:50.910 --> 00:31:52.292
SAM: "Try farting."

900
00:31:52.292 --> 00:31:54.530
LAURA: Or you can disengage and then--

901
00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:58.664
SAM: I will try a strength-- I will try to get out of this.

902
00:31:58.664 --> 00:31:59.630
Try to get out.
LAURA: Are you grappled,

903
00:31:59.630 --> 00:32:01.005
or are you just right next to him?

904
00:32:01.005 --> 00:32:02.081
MATT: Grappled and restrained.

905
00:32:02.081 --> 00:32:02.914
LAURA: Oh, fuck.

906
00:32:02.914 --> 00:32:04.432
MARISHA: It has disadvantage on strength checks right now.

907
00:32:04.432 --> 00:32:05.265
LAURA: Oh, that's true.

908
00:32:05.265 --> 00:32:07.178
TRAVIS: Yeah, but it's your check, not his, right?

909
00:32:07.178 --> 00:32:08.329
Or is it contested?
MARISHA: I think it's contested,

910
00:32:08.329 --> 00:32:09.456
is it contested?

911
00:32:09.456 --> 00:32:11.889
MATT: For this one it is contested, yes.

912
00:32:11.889 --> 00:32:14.815
SAM: I will try to scurry out.

913
00:32:14.815 --> 00:32:15.648
MATT: All right.

914
00:32:15.648 --> 00:32:18.130
SAM: Using the strength of my conviction

915
00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:22.429
and my 19 that I rolled, plus my strength,

916
00:32:22.429 --> 00:32:24.167
which is zero.

917
00:32:24.167 --> 00:32:25.755
(laughter)

918
00:32:25.755 --> 00:32:27.476
MATT: It rolled a 15 plus five, a 20.

919
00:32:27.476 --> 00:32:29.669
(groaning)

920
00:32:29.669 --> 00:32:31.708
SAM: So really, I needed a 20.

921
00:32:31.708 --> 00:32:33.005
(chuckles)

922
00:32:33.005 --> 00:32:35.037
TRAVIS: At disadvantage? That sucks.
MARISHA: And that's at disadvantage?

923
00:32:35.037 --> 00:32:35.870
MATT: Hmm?

924
00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:36.848
MARISHA: That's at disadvantage?

925
00:32:36.848 --> 00:32:38.963
MATT: Wait, he has disadvantage on strength checks?

926
00:32:38.963 --> 00:32:41.399
No, he does half damage with any strength-based attacks.

927
00:32:41.399 --> 00:32:42.502
It doesn't change his actual checks.

928
00:32:42.502 --> 00:32:43.535
TALIESIN: Yeah.
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

929
00:32:43.535 --> 00:32:44.376
TRAVIS: That's different.
TALIESIN: Doesn't have

930
00:32:44.376 --> 00:32:45.975
disadvantage on strength checks.

931
00:32:45.975 --> 00:32:47.632
SAM: Can I bonus action hide?

932
00:32:47.632 --> 00:32:50.197
(laughter)

933
00:32:50.197 --> 00:32:53.594
MATT: Within the muscles of its weird, perverted form?

934
00:32:53.594 --> 00:32:54.755
You can try.

935
00:32:54.755 --> 00:32:59.619
SAM: No, but do I get to do a bonus action

936
00:32:59.619 --> 00:33:01.426
dodge. I mean, like, defend?

937
00:33:01.426 --> 00:33:03.939
Is there a defend action?

938
00:33:03.939 --> 00:33:04.772
Is there like a--

939
00:33:04.772 --> 00:33:09.772
MARISHA: You can take an action to

940
00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:11.284
defend.

941
00:33:11.284 --> 00:33:14.261
Monks basically get to do it as a bonus action,

942
00:33:14.261 --> 00:33:17.169
but anyone can take the dodge

943
00:33:17.169 --> 00:33:18.344
as their action.
MATT: You can dash, disengage, or hide

944
00:33:18.344 --> 00:33:19.560
as a bonus action.

945
00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:20.747
That's all you got.
SAM: I can't block.

946
00:33:20.747 --> 00:33:22.250
MARISHA: Yeah, anyone can dodge, but you have to

947
00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:23.382
take your action to do it.

948
00:33:23.382 --> 00:33:25.657
MATT: Correct.

949
00:33:25.657 --> 00:33:27.862
SAM: Then I will not do anything,

950
00:33:27.862 --> 00:33:30.342
and I will just, I'll fart on it.

951
00:33:30.342 --> 00:33:31.175
(laughs)

952
00:33:31.175 --> 00:33:32.457
MATT: Fair enough, that finishes your turn.

953
00:33:32.457 --> 00:33:33.867
MARISHA: Girl power!

954
00:33:33.867 --> 00:33:36.471
LIAM: Beat the shit out of him, Beauregard!

955
00:33:36.471 --> 00:33:37.882
MARISHA: This is precarious, right?

956
00:33:37.882 --> 00:33:40.241
With me being a large--
MATT: Yeah.

957
00:33:40.241 --> 00:33:41.484
MARISHA: A large Beau?

958
00:33:41.484 --> 00:33:42.317
All right.

959
00:33:44.092 --> 00:33:45.898
I can run past these guys, right?

960
00:33:45.898 --> 00:33:48.396
MATT: Yeah, you run past allies.

961
00:33:48.396 --> 00:33:52.726
MARISHA: 50 foot movement speed, so five, 10, 15, 20,

962
00:33:52.726 --> 00:33:57.196
25, 30, 35, 40, 45, huh?

963
00:33:57.196 --> 00:34:00.171
MATT: Yeah, you would be able to get to about there,

964
00:34:00.171 --> 00:34:02.875
to be in melee with him, yes.

965
00:34:02.875 --> 00:34:03.748
MARISHA: All right.

966
00:34:03.748 --> 00:34:05.639
TALIESIN: (thudding footsteps)

967
00:34:05.639 --> 00:34:08.505
MARISHA: With my big hulking form,

968
00:34:08.505 --> 00:34:10.677
I'm just going to do some big, like,

969
00:34:10.677 --> 00:34:13.741
Iron Man-style haymakers, just going full, like--

970
00:34:13.741 --> 00:34:16.388
MATT: Just straight in, go for it.

971
00:34:16.388 --> 00:34:18.305
MARISHA: Pop pop.
LIAM: Another 20.

972
00:34:19.546 --> 00:34:21.394
TRAVIS: Well, there's the balance.

973
00:34:21.394 --> 00:34:23.392
(laughter)
LIAM: Yep.

974
00:34:23.392 --> 00:34:24.231
LAURA: Was it double ones?

975
00:34:24.231 --> 00:34:25.098
TRAVIS: One and a three.

976
00:34:25.098 --> 00:34:27.611
(laughter)

977
00:34:27.611 --> 00:34:29.920
MATT and MARISHA: Yeah. Yeah.

978
00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:31.111
MATT: That's your action.

979
00:34:31.111 --> 00:34:32.769
You rush around, and as you go to swing,

980
00:34:32.769 --> 00:34:34.888
the liquid that actually hits the lower part of the floor

981
00:34:34.888 --> 00:34:37.072
actually gets slick at this point at the stairs,

982
00:34:37.072 --> 00:34:38.755
and as you reach forward with a swing,

983
00:34:38.755 --> 00:34:39.588
your foot goes out from under you

984
00:34:39.588 --> 00:34:41.158
and you have to actually catch yourself on the stair.

985
00:34:41.158 --> 00:34:42.901
MARISHA: Oh, my back!
MATT: Yep.

986
00:34:42.901 --> 00:34:43.906
Twists a little bit.

987
00:34:43.906 --> 00:34:46.323
Still have your bonus action.

988
00:34:48.087 --> 00:34:50.374
LIAM: Monk masters and their bad backs, man.

989
00:34:50.374 --> 00:34:52.624
(laughter)

990
00:34:53.979 --> 00:34:55.371
MARISHA: I will...

991
00:34:58.975 --> 00:35:00.284
Fuck it.

992
00:35:00.284 --> 00:35:01.694
Flurry of Blows.
LIAM: I wouldn't fuck that thing,

993
00:35:01.694 --> 00:35:03.936
that seems like a bad idea.

994
00:35:03.936 --> 00:35:05.302
MARISHA: ♪ Flurry of Blows ♪

995
00:35:05.302 --> 00:35:06.143
MATT: Everyone's got their thing, man.

996
00:35:06.143 --> 00:35:07.686
LAURA: Yeah, I know, you don't know. (laughs)

997
00:35:07.686 --> 00:35:08.962
MATT: Don't kinkshame.

998
00:35:08.962 --> 00:35:11.420
MARISHA: Well, well.

999
00:35:12.543 --> 00:35:13.376
TRAVIS: Oh no.
LIAM: There's teeth

1000
00:35:13.376 --> 00:35:14.323
where there should be a--

1001
00:35:14.323 --> 00:35:16.272
LAURA: Oh no!
SAM: What's this?

1002
00:35:16.272 --> 00:35:18.127
The pendulum has swung?
TRAVIS: I won't say them for you.

1003
00:35:18.127 --> 00:35:19.197
MARISHA: It's a three and a four.

1004
00:35:19.197 --> 00:35:20.810
(laughter)

1005
00:35:20.810 --> 00:35:22.642
MATT: The four is a total of?

1006
00:35:22.642 --> 00:35:23.641
MARISHA: 14.

1007
00:35:23.641 --> 00:35:26.084
MATT: 14, no, that misses. Yeah, I'm sorry.

1008
00:35:26.084 --> 00:35:27.563
You get up once more, and as you go to swing,

1009
00:35:27.563 --> 00:35:30.756
you swing twice more, but the large hand on its left side

1010
00:35:30.756 --> 00:35:32.164
actually grabs your forehead and

1011
00:35:32.164 --> 00:35:33.636
holds you at bay like a bully.

1012
00:35:33.636 --> 00:35:34.636
LIAM: Oh, gross.

1013
00:35:36.433 --> 00:35:38.807
TRAVIS: That's embarrassing.
MATT: I know.

1014
00:35:38.807 --> 00:35:42.828
LAURA: Plus, you're really big, so we all saw it, like...

1015
00:35:42.828 --> 00:35:43.891
(laughter)

1016
00:35:43.891 --> 00:35:45.466
MATT: Caleb, you're up.
LAURA: Prominently.

1017
00:35:45.466 --> 00:35:47.073
LIAM: I'm up already?
MATT: Yep.

1018
00:35:47.073 --> 00:35:48.564
LIAM: Oh jeez.
TALIESIN: It's not gone well.

1019
00:35:48.564 --> 00:35:50.731
LIAM: That went quickly to me.

1020
00:35:52.963 --> 00:35:57.490
<i>Ja</i>, okay, I'm just going to throw-- hmm.

1021
00:35:57.490 --> 00:35:59.984
a Fire Bolt at his head.

1022
00:35:59.984 --> 00:36:00.817
MATT: Go for it.

1023
00:36:00.817 --> 00:36:02.231
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, okay.

1024
00:36:02.231 --> 00:36:03.449
SAM: Which head?

1025
00:36:03.449 --> 00:36:05.482
LIAM: The human one

1026
00:36:05.482 --> 00:36:06.682
because that's how I roll.

1027
00:36:06.682 --> 00:36:08.982
Make a ranged spell attack, here it comes.

1028
00:36:08.982 --> 00:36:11.029
MARISHA: Yeah, the human one?

1029
00:36:11.029 --> 00:36:13.061
LIAM: The one that's making human moans. That misses.

1030
00:36:13.061 --> 00:36:13.969
LAURA: Oh, oh, oh.

1031
00:36:13.969 --> 00:36:15.227
LIAM: Misses, definitely misses.

1032
00:36:15.227 --> 00:36:17.977
LAURA: Oh no, what are we doing, what happened?

1033
00:36:17.977 --> 00:36:19.648
Oh no, we felt too good!

1034
00:36:19.648 --> 00:36:20.628
(laughter)

1035
00:36:20.628 --> 00:36:23.819
SAM: We flew too close to the sun!

1036
00:36:23.819 --> 00:36:25.486
LAURA: (shouting) No!

1037
00:36:25.486 --> 00:36:28.495
LIAM: I will, yeah, just move a little bit further this way

1038
00:36:28.495 --> 00:36:29.445
and stay put.

1039
00:36:29.445 --> 00:36:30.434
MATT: All right.

1040
00:36:30.434 --> 00:36:32.203
That finishes your go. Fjord, you're up.

1041
00:36:32.203 --> 00:36:33.036
TRAVIS: Okay.

1042
00:36:36.113 --> 00:36:38.206
Both Nott and I are still--

1043
00:36:38.206 --> 00:36:40.295
MATT: Held, yeah.
TRAVIS: Getting palmed by the son of a bitch?

1044
00:36:40.295 --> 00:36:43.296
MATT: Nott is hanging in the mouth of one of the heads.

1045
00:36:43.296 --> 00:36:45.244
You are currently a giant hand.

1046
00:36:45.244 --> 00:36:46.888
Like the hand itself is about maybe the size

1047
00:36:46.888 --> 00:36:49.657
of your mid-chest, and the fingers are wrapped around you

1048
00:36:49.657 --> 00:36:51.012
and holding you in place.

1049
00:36:51.012 --> 00:36:52.830
TRAVIS: (grunting)

1050
00:36:52.830 --> 00:36:56.093
TRAVIS: Is Nott like, five feet away from me?

1051
00:36:56.093 --> 00:36:57.760
MATT: Approximately, I'd say...

1052
00:37:00.472 --> 00:37:03.185
You're both all sharing the,

1053
00:37:03.185 --> 00:37:05.480
no, Nott would be 10 feet from you.

1054
00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:07.974
TRAVIS: (sighs) Shit!
SAM: It's okay, you do you.

1055
00:37:07.974 --> 00:37:09.390
TRAVIS: You sure?
SAM: I'll be fine.

1056
00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:10.390
TRAVIS: All right.

1057
00:37:11.949 --> 00:37:15.522
I'm going to reach out my hand and say: Nott, take my hand!

1058
00:37:15.522 --> 00:37:17.055
She can't reach it.

1059
00:37:17.055 --> 00:37:20.622
SAM: I use my reaction to reach it with my tiny little hand.

1060
00:37:20.622 --> 00:37:22.182
(laughter)

1061
00:37:22.182 --> 00:37:23.571
I got a six-inch reach.

1062
00:37:23.571 --> 00:37:25.302
TRAVIS: She comes up short?

1063
00:37:25.302 --> 00:37:26.535
MATT: Comes up short, yeah.

1064
00:37:26.535 --> 00:37:28.293
TRAVIS: All right, then fuck it, I will--

1065
00:37:28.293 --> 00:37:29.393
I'm not going to do that.

1066
00:37:29.393 --> 00:37:32.918
I will use my action to try and break out of the--

1067
00:37:32.918 --> 00:37:34.527
to break out of the grapple.
SAM: Fjord!

1068
00:37:34.527 --> 00:37:36.384
MATT: Go for it.
SAM: You can go if you need to.

1069
00:37:36.384 --> 00:37:37.217
TRAVIS: No, I--

1070
00:37:37.217 --> 00:37:38.516
It would hurt you, too.
MATT: Contested strength roll.

1071
00:37:38.516 --> 00:37:39.766
TRAVIS: Okay.

1072
00:37:41.469 --> 00:37:42.535
Ugh.

1073
00:37:42.535 --> 00:37:43.768
SAM: He's not always an asshole.

1074
00:37:43.768 --> 00:37:45.157
TRAVIS: 11.

1075
00:37:45.157 --> 00:37:46.227
MATT: 13.

1076
00:37:46.227 --> 00:37:47.151
Yeah, that beats you.

1077
00:37:47.151 --> 00:37:48.507
TRAVIS: Fucking goddamn it.

1078
00:37:48.507 --> 00:37:49.786
MATT: You won't let you break free.
You still have your bonus action,

1079
00:37:49.786 --> 00:37:50.911
and your movement.

1080
00:37:50.911 --> 00:37:52.042
Well, not actually your movement.

1081
00:37:52.042 --> 00:37:53.701
TRAVIS: Yeah, I don't have any movement,

1082
00:37:53.701 --> 00:37:57.877
and I think bonus action, ♪ I don't have any, ♪

1083
00:37:57.877 --> 00:37:59.754
♪ I'm not going to cast Hex. ♪

1084
00:37:59.754 --> 00:38:03.273
Yeah, no, that ends my turn.

1085
00:38:03.273 --> 00:38:05.139
MATT: Okay. It's now the creature's turn.

1086
00:38:05.139 --> 00:38:06.247
It heals up a little more.

1087
00:38:06.247 --> 00:38:07.965
Its wounds begin to seal up slightly.

1088
00:38:07.965 --> 00:38:10.563
It now, seeing large Beau running around the side

1089
00:38:10.563 --> 00:38:11.670
and slipping and falling, holding you at bay,

1090
00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:14.138
clutching both of them, it's still feeling ill,

1091
00:38:14.138 --> 00:38:15.445
and you can see the green energy

1092
00:38:15.445 --> 00:38:17.343
seeping into its body from the Ray of Enfeeblement.

1093
00:38:17.343 --> 00:38:19.008
It sees in the distance, in the shadow,

1094
00:38:19.008 --> 00:38:21.044
Caduceus' silhouette back up in towards

1095
00:38:21.044 --> 00:38:23.172
one of the light sources of green.

1096
00:38:23.172 --> 00:38:24.694
One of the heads (snarls).

1097
00:38:24.694 --> 00:38:27.299
It's going to attempt to climb up into the chains

1098
00:38:27.299 --> 00:38:29.730
and head that direction. Beau, you do get your reaction.

1099
00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:32.015
MARISHA: And this time, I can make them stop.

1100
00:38:32.015 --> 00:38:33.338
MATT: Correct.
TALIESIN: Make it stop.

1101
00:38:33.338 --> 00:38:35.747
MARISHA: Make it stop!
LAURA: Please make him stop!

1102
00:38:35.747 --> 00:38:38.954
MARISHA: You were doing good, you were doing good to me.

1103
00:38:38.954 --> 00:38:40.637
Okay, okay, okay, 25.

1104
00:38:40.637 --> 00:38:41.470
LIAM: It was almost a one.

1105
00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:43.084
MATT: 25 definitely works.

1106
00:38:43.084 --> 00:38:43.925
LAURA: Yes.

1107
00:38:43.925 --> 00:38:45.358
MATT: 25 hits.

1108
00:38:45.358 --> 00:38:46.830
Yeah, he can't fucking move.

1109
00:38:46.830 --> 00:38:47.663
MARISHA: Big Beau.

1110
00:38:47.663 --> 00:38:49.157
LIAM: Don't forget your size.
MATT: Monks, man.

1111
00:38:49.157 --> 00:38:50.803
MARISHA: I'm just going to, as he crawls away, grab him

1112
00:38:50.803 --> 00:38:54.378
and like try and hold him by one of his shitty feet.

1113
00:38:54.378 --> 00:38:55.878
LAURA: "His shitty feet."

1114
00:38:58.256 --> 00:38:59.356
MARISHA: 11.

1115
00:38:59.356 --> 00:39:00.238
MATT: 11.
MARISHA: Yeah.

1116
00:39:00.238 --> 00:39:01.071
MATT: Okay.

1117
00:39:03.133 --> 00:39:05.247
You grab his foot and yank it back down,

1118
00:39:05.247 --> 00:39:06.635
slam him onto the stonework.

1119
00:39:06.635 --> 00:39:08.935
Both of you get jostled around from the impact.

1120
00:39:08.935 --> 00:39:11.825
You can see one of the heads turn towards you,

1121
00:39:11.825 --> 00:39:13.790
its face half bent to one side

1122
00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:16.115
and the eye slips in your direction.

1123
00:39:16.115 --> 00:39:17.835
MARISHA: 'Sup.

1124
00:39:17.835 --> 00:39:18.676
TALIESIN: (low-pitched) 'Sup.

1125
00:39:18.676 --> 00:39:20.330
MATT: He's going to take his round.

1126
00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:22.327
He is--

1127
00:39:22.327 --> 00:39:23.171
LIAM: Eyes up.

1128
00:39:23.171 --> 00:39:26.160
MATT: Actually no, I get to roll, okay.

1129
00:39:27.478 --> 00:39:29.548
He now goes into a fearful rage.

1130
00:39:29.548 --> 00:39:32.023
SAM and LIAM: A fearful rage?

1131
00:39:32.023 --> 00:39:34.743
MATT: The damage its taken has started to impact it enough,

1132
00:39:34.743 --> 00:39:35.697
and it can't get away.

1133
00:39:35.697 --> 00:39:37.301
You can see the eyes now darting around,

1134
00:39:37.301 --> 00:39:39.664
and now it's starting to have that fight or flight

1135
00:39:39.664 --> 00:39:41.279
maneuver in it, and in doing so,

1136
00:39:41.279 --> 00:39:42.636
gets advantage on all of its attacks.

1137
00:39:42.636 --> 00:39:43.469
(gasps)

1138
00:39:43.469 --> 00:39:45.896
It's going to unload entirely on you, Beauregard,

1139
00:39:45.896 --> 00:39:48.145
since you're the one who kept it down.

1140
00:39:48.145 --> 00:39:48.978
MARISHA: That's fine.

1141
00:39:48.978 --> 00:39:51.395
MATT: So six attacks on you.

1142
00:39:51.395 --> 00:39:52.808
MARISHA: That's fine!

1143
00:39:52.808 --> 00:39:54.099
TALIESIN: All damage is halved.

1144
00:39:54.099 --> 00:39:55.330
LAURA: That's good.

1145
00:39:55.330 --> 00:39:56.163
TALIESIN: Before it even gets to you.

1146
00:39:56.163 --> 00:39:57.528
SAM: If it's a strength-based attack.

1147
00:39:57.528 --> 00:39:59.445
MATT: It is strength-based.

1148
00:40:01.038 --> 00:40:02.936
All right, that is a 25 to hit.

1149
00:40:02.936 --> 00:40:04.728
MARISHA: Hits.
MATT: For the first one.

1150
00:40:06.173 --> 00:40:09.647
The second one is a 22 to hit.

1151
00:40:09.647 --> 00:40:12.242
MARISHA: Yep, so together that's 47.

1152
00:40:12.242 --> 00:40:14.026
Oh, it hits, hits, hits, sorry.

1153
00:40:14.026 --> 00:40:15.040
Yes, hits.

1154
00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:16.260
SAM: Tits, tits, tits.

1155
00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:17.110
MATT: 23 to hit?

1156
00:40:17.110 --> 00:40:17.943
MARISHA: Hits.

1157
00:40:20.005 --> 00:40:20.848
MATT: 17 to hit.

1158
00:40:20.848 --> 00:40:22.098
MARISHA: Miss.
MATT: Right.

1159
00:40:24.717 --> 00:40:26.092
25 to hit.

1160
00:40:26.092 --> 00:40:27.342
MARISHA: Yeah.

1161
00:40:29.722 --> 00:40:32.863
MATT: And 24 to hit.
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

1162
00:40:32.863 --> 00:40:33.789
MATT: The last one's going to be a bite attack.

1163
00:40:33.789 --> 00:40:34.939
LAURA: No, that was six hits.

1164
00:40:34.939 --> 00:40:36.560
MATT: One of them missed, so five hits,

1165
00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:39.446
four of which are regular and one of them's a bite attack.

1166
00:40:39.446 --> 00:40:43.507
For the slams against you, that is--

1167
00:40:43.507 --> 00:40:44.893
MARISHA: Thanks, Caduceus.

1168
00:40:44.893 --> 00:40:46.311
MATT: 10 reduced to five.

1169
00:40:46.311 --> 00:40:49.487
MARISHA: Okay.
LAURA: That's good.

1170
00:40:49.487 --> 00:40:51.528
MATT: 11 reduced to five.

1171
00:40:51.528 --> 00:40:52.970
MARISHA: Okay.

1172
00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:53.803
MATT: Mm!

1173
00:40:55.145 --> 00:40:56.812
17 reduced to eight.

1174
00:41:00.113 --> 00:41:01.780
16 reduced to eight.

1175
00:41:03.297 --> 00:41:05.380
Then the bite attack.

1176
00:41:06.553 --> 00:41:09.243
TALIESIN: Really thinking about this, I was trying to pick

1177
00:41:09.243 --> 00:41:10.939
what spell to cast.

1178
00:41:10.939 --> 00:41:12.941
LAURA: Good job.
MARISHA: Thank you.

1179
00:41:12.941 --> 00:41:16.688
That would've been way fucking worse.

1180
00:41:16.688 --> 00:41:18.580
Clerics, hell yes.

1181
00:41:22.613 --> 00:41:26.272
MATT: 21 points of piercing damage reduced to 10.

1182
00:41:26.272 --> 00:41:27.524
MARISHA: Okay.

1183
00:41:28.581 --> 00:41:29.414
SAM: Okay!

1184
00:41:29.414 --> 00:41:31.548
MATT: And that's his turn, because he can't fucking move.

1185
00:41:31.548 --> 00:41:34.883
Cool, all right, Caduceus, Jester, you're up.

1186
00:41:34.883 --> 00:41:35.829
TALIESIN: Do you want to go first, or?

1187
00:41:35.829 --> 00:41:36.723
LAURA: No, it's all you.

1188
00:41:36.723 --> 00:41:37.556
TALIESIN: Okay.

1189
00:41:37.556 --> 00:41:41.431
I'm going to kind of

1190
00:41:41.431 --> 00:41:43.714
try and cross the room again,

1191
00:41:43.714 --> 00:41:45.641
just towards me, just to get a little,

1192
00:41:45.641 --> 00:41:47.731
and while I cross, I'm going to try and find an open shot

1193
00:41:47.731 --> 00:41:49.154
and take a Sacred Flame attack.

1194
00:41:49.154 --> 00:41:49.987
MATT: Okay.

1195
00:41:49.987 --> 00:41:51.245
Sacred Flame is dexterity saving throw?

1196
00:41:51.245 --> 00:41:53.128
TALIESIN: Yep.
MATT: All righty.

1197
00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:56.875
That is going to be a 10.

1198
00:41:56.875 --> 00:41:58.109
TALIESIN: No, that is a fail.

1199
00:41:58.109 --> 00:41:59.158
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage on that.

1200
00:41:59.158 --> 00:42:00.158
TALIESIN: All right.

1201
00:42:01.257 --> 00:42:04.957
Sacred Flame, that's

1202
00:42:04.957 --> 00:42:06.590
13 points of radiant damage.

1203
00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:08.039
MATT: 13 points, nice.

1204
00:42:08.039 --> 00:42:12.789
TALIESIN: And, let's see, anything else?

1205
00:42:14.788 --> 00:42:19.554
Just because I saw it, I'm-- no, no, I'm good,

1206
00:42:19.554 --> 00:42:20.387
I'm going to hold there.

1207
00:42:20.387 --> 00:42:21.485
MATT: That's the end of your turn, Caduceus.

1208
00:42:21.485 --> 00:42:22.787
Jester, you're up.

1209
00:42:22.787 --> 00:42:23.620
LAURA: Okay.

1210
00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:29.580
I'm going to come over here

1211
00:42:29.646 --> 00:42:30.766
and just come up the steps

1212
00:42:30.766 --> 00:42:33.510
a little bit where I can see him.

1213
00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:37.965
Then I'm going to try to cast Polymorph on him.

1214
00:42:37.965 --> 00:42:39.801
MATT: Okay.

1215
00:42:39.801 --> 00:42:42.886
As you gather the spell, what form do you want to choose?

1216
00:42:42.886 --> 00:42:46.589
LAURA: I'm going to turn him into a turtle,

1217
00:42:46.589 --> 00:42:48.311
but with lots of heads.

1218
00:42:48.311 --> 00:42:49.224
(laughter)

1219
00:42:49.224 --> 00:42:50.301
MATT: Fair enough.

1220
00:42:50.301 --> 00:42:52.566
(laughter)

1221
00:42:52.566 --> 00:42:54.919
As you focus the spell through the Traveler's gift

1222
00:42:54.919 --> 00:42:58.182
and release the power, unfortunately, one of its things

1223
00:42:58.182 --> 00:43:00.054
is it can't be Polymorphed.

1224
00:43:00.054 --> 00:43:03.583
It has an Immutable Form.

1225
00:43:03.583 --> 00:43:05.515
TRAVIS: But it was wonderful imagery.

1226
00:43:05.515 --> 00:43:08.096
MATT: That was a wonderful description, I'm sorry.

1227
00:43:08.096 --> 00:43:11.452
MARISHA: Immutable form? I didn't get that in my thing.

1228
00:43:11.452 --> 00:43:13.220
MATT: You don't learn all of its abilities.

1229
00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:15.490
You learn its condition immunities

1230
00:43:15.490 --> 00:43:16.985
and its damage immunities.

1231
00:43:16.985 --> 00:43:19.932
This is actually--
MARISHA: Special abilities.

1232
00:43:19.932 --> 00:43:21.590
MATT: Yes, this is something that

1233
00:43:21.590 --> 00:43:23.753
pretty much all golems have is Immutable Form.

1234
00:43:23.753 --> 00:43:25.957
TRAVIS: When made so perfectly, why would you change it?

1235
00:43:25.957 --> 00:43:27.396
MATT: Yeah.

1236
00:43:27.396 --> 00:43:31.246
TALIESIN: (cackling)

1237
00:43:31.246 --> 00:43:34.171
MATT: That finish your turn, Jester?

1238
00:43:34.171 --> 00:43:38.900
LAURA: I don't think I've got Healing Word.

1239
00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:40.115
MATT: You already cast a spell anyway, so.

1240
00:43:40.115 --> 00:43:42.284
LAURA: Oh, yeah, you're right, so fuck it.

1241
00:43:42.284 --> 00:43:43.895
MATT: Okay, Willi's go.

1242
00:43:43.895 --> 00:43:45.970
LIAM: Same command, stay put, protect me.

1243
00:43:45.970 --> 00:43:47.247
MATT: Stay put and protect you, you got it.

1244
00:43:47.247 --> 00:43:49.369
All right. Top of the round, Beau and Nott.

1245
00:43:49.369 --> 00:43:51.341
MARISHA and SAM: (shouting)

1246
00:43:51.341 --> 00:43:54.261
MATT: You're still being chewed on, Nott.

1247
00:43:54.261 --> 00:43:55.934
SAM: I don't like that.

1248
00:43:55.934 --> 00:43:58.133
MARISHA: Do you want me to try and, like, yank you out?

1249
00:43:58.133 --> 00:44:00.054
SAM: You do what you do.

1250
00:44:00.054 --> 00:44:02.446
I'm in a mouth.

1251
00:44:02.446 --> 00:44:05.860
There's not much deciding I'm going to do.

1252
00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:10.860
I guess I'll try to stab it.

1253
00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:12.206
MATT: Okay.

1254
00:44:12.206 --> 00:44:13.303
You pull out your dagger?

1255
00:44:13.303 --> 00:44:16.474
SAM: Dagger of Denial and just sort of jab at it.

1256
00:44:16.474 --> 00:44:18.057
MATT: Go for it, roll for attack

1257
00:44:18.057 --> 00:44:19.635
at disadvantage.

1258
00:44:19.635 --> 00:44:20.599
SAM: Disadvantage.

1259
00:44:20.599 --> 00:44:21.733
MATT: Because you're restrained.

1260
00:44:21.733 --> 00:44:23.356
SAM: Oh, they're both really good.

1261
00:44:23.356 --> 00:44:24.788
26.

1262
00:44:24.788 --> 00:44:25.846
MATT: 26.
SAM: Yeah.

1263
00:44:25.846 --> 00:44:27.206
MATT: Okay, that hits.
SAM: All right.

1264
00:44:27.206 --> 00:44:28.331
MATT: I will say, even though you

1265
00:44:28.331 --> 00:44:29.432
have disadvantage on the attack roll,

1266
00:44:29.432 --> 00:44:31.712
because one of your friends is in melee,

1267
00:44:31.712 --> 00:44:32.826
it is considered a sneak attack.

1268
00:44:32.826 --> 00:44:33.659
SAM: Okay.

1269
00:44:33.659 --> 00:44:34.669
MATT: You actually like reach back

1270
00:44:34.669 --> 00:44:36.902
and jam it into its eye with the blade.

1271
00:44:36.902 --> 00:44:38.579
LAURA: Tight.

1272
00:44:38.579 --> 00:44:40.481
SAM: And I get all the sneak attack damage?

1273
00:44:40.481 --> 00:44:42.351
MATT: Yes, you do.
TRAVIS: It's still holding me!

1274
00:44:42.351 --> 00:44:45.136
(laughter)

1275
00:44:45.136 --> 00:44:48.803
MATT: You see Nott just fling the arm a few times,

1276
00:44:48.803 --> 00:44:50.322
and you're having to like... (laughs)

1277
00:44:50.322 --> 00:44:52.368
SAM: 22 points of damage.

1278
00:44:54.093 --> 00:44:56.718
I will also activate the dagger,

1279
00:44:56.718 --> 00:44:59.084
closing the door to its mouth,

1280
00:44:59.084 --> 00:45:00.595
so it can't open the mouth anymore.

1281
00:45:00.595 --> 00:45:03.826
(laughter)

1282
00:45:03.826 --> 00:45:06.429
MATT: One, doesn't work that way.

1283
00:45:06.429 --> 00:45:07.614
Two, you're in its mouth, so you wouldn't

1284
00:45:07.614 --> 00:45:09.047
want that to happen either.

1285
00:45:09.047 --> 00:45:10.799
(laughter)

1286
00:45:10.799 --> 00:45:11.894
SAM: Damn it.

1287
00:45:11.894 --> 00:45:13.751
MATT: A curious thought.

1288
00:45:13.751 --> 00:45:15.092
All right.

1289
00:45:15.092 --> 00:45:16.209
You still have your bonus action.

1290
00:45:16.209 --> 00:45:17.780
SAM: I can't do anything on my bonus action,

1291
00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:21.383
so I will just yell and scream.

1292
00:45:21.383 --> 00:45:23.433
Ah, ah!

1293
00:45:23.433 --> 00:45:24.493
MATT: You got it.

1294
00:45:24.493 --> 00:45:25.608
Beauregard, you're up.

1295
00:45:25.608 --> 00:45:28.165
MARISHA: I've got him by his leg still.

1296
00:45:28.165 --> 00:45:29.138
MATT: Yep.

1297
00:45:29.138 --> 00:45:31.268
MARISHA: Yeah, hmm.

1298
00:45:31.268 --> 00:45:35.980
I want to drag him forward.

1299
00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:36.842
MATT: Okay.

1300
00:45:36.842 --> 00:45:38.455
MARISHA: And punch him in the face.

1301
00:45:38.455 --> 00:45:39.288
MATT: Which one?

1302
00:45:39.288 --> 00:45:41.138
TALIESIN: All of them!

1303
00:45:41.138 --> 00:45:42.982
MATT: One punch for each face.

1304
00:45:42.982 --> 00:45:44.569
MARISHA: Can I try and like go for the temple

1305
00:45:44.569 --> 00:45:46.275
of the one that's holding Nott?

1306
00:45:46.275 --> 00:45:47.516
MATT: Sure. Yeah, go for it.

1307
00:45:47.516 --> 00:45:49.743
MARISHA: Kind of like: Spit it out!

1308
00:45:49.743 --> 00:45:52.234
ALL: Drop it!

1309
00:45:53.917 --> 00:45:55.089
MARISHA: Okay.

1310
00:45:55.089 --> 00:45:56.036
Natural 20.

1311
00:45:56.036 --> 00:45:57.818
MATT: Yeah, yeah.

1312
00:45:57.818 --> 00:46:00.411
MARISHA: And 16 plus 10, so 26.

1313
00:46:00.411 --> 00:46:01.609
MATT: Both definitely hit, yeah.

1314
00:46:01.609 --> 00:46:03.392
MARISHA: I'll do this Nat20 first.

1315
00:46:03.392 --> 00:46:04.965
TRAVIS: Crit that shit.

1316
00:46:05.906 --> 00:46:06.881
(grunting)

1317
00:46:06.881 --> 00:46:10.813
MARISHA: Big Beau in the house!

1318
00:46:10.813 --> 00:46:13.238
12 plus-- 18 damage.

1319
00:46:14.941 --> 00:46:19.750
I'm not going to try and stun him, that's dumb.

1320
00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:21.250
I'm over stunning.

1321
00:46:22.322 --> 00:46:25.435
Okay, 10 points.

1322
00:46:25.435 --> 00:46:26.627
MATT: 10, nice.

1323
00:46:29.063 --> 00:46:31.313
(laughter)

1324
00:46:32.646 --> 00:46:33.973
MATT: And your bonus action.

1325
00:46:33.973 --> 00:46:37.395
LIAM: Then you say "how do you want to do this?"
MATT: No.

1326
00:46:37.395 --> 00:46:38.806
SAM: (whispering) Matt forgot his line.

1327
00:46:38.806 --> 00:46:43.572
(laughter)

1328
00:46:43.572 --> 00:46:45.452
MATT: Sorry, I ran out of time to read the bullet points

1329
00:46:45.452 --> 00:46:46.971
before I got here.

1330
00:46:46.971 --> 00:46:48.752
TRAVIS: (whispering) Mr. Mercer, your line is--

1331
00:46:48.752 --> 00:46:51.002
(laughter)

1332
00:46:53.206 --> 00:46:54.937
MATT: So bonus action?

1333
00:46:54.937 --> 00:46:56.819
(laughter)

1334
00:46:56.819 --> 00:46:58.156
MARISHA: Bonus action--

1335
00:46:58.156 --> 00:47:00.466
MATT: Nott's screaming in its jaws.

1336
00:47:00.466 --> 00:47:03.671
Fjord, you can barely see, being held in place

1337
00:47:03.671 --> 00:47:05.497
and being thrashed around.
TRAVIS: Help me!

1338
00:47:05.497 --> 00:47:08.076
MARISHA: Can I try and yank Nott out of its mouth?

1339
00:47:08.076 --> 00:47:10.225
MATT: Not as a bonus action. It would
be an action to do that.

1340
00:47:10.225 --> 00:47:11.845
MARISHA: Okay.

1341
00:47:11.845 --> 00:47:14.387
TRAVIS: You hurt him real good.

1342
00:47:14.387 --> 00:47:17.017
MARISHA: I'll just attack for my bonus action.

1343
00:47:17.017 --> 00:47:18.075
Just a regular old attack.

1344
00:47:18.075 --> 00:47:19.270
MATT: Regular attack, go for it.

1345
00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:20.353
LIAM: Keep rolling those 20s.

1346
00:47:20.353 --> 00:47:21.770
MARISHA: Come on.

1347
00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:25.123
I don't know what's going to happen.

1348
00:47:25.123 --> 00:47:28.239
No, no, that's not a 20, it's a two, so 12.

1349
00:47:28.239 --> 00:47:31.159
MATT: Yeah, that's a fail, sorry.

1350
00:47:31.159 --> 00:47:32.816
Swings wide.

1351
00:47:32.816 --> 00:47:35.122
This time trying to find a place, as you're holding its leg,

1352
00:47:35.122 --> 00:47:36.432
you pull it back and try to pummel it,

1353
00:47:36.432 --> 00:47:38.377
you get two good hits in, it withdraws,

1354
00:47:38.377 --> 00:47:40.322
its slippery arm slipping out of your grip,

1355
00:47:40.322 --> 00:47:42.144
you go for a third strike, and it just moves

1356
00:47:42.144 --> 00:47:44.289
out of your space, unfortunately.

1357
00:47:44.289 --> 00:47:46.545
(mumbled) Finishing your go, Beau, Nott. Caleb, you're up.

1358
00:47:46.545 --> 00:47:48.477
ALL: (imitating mumbling)

1359
00:47:48.477 --> 00:47:53.157
LIAM: So Caleb sees our good start start to go sideways

1360
00:47:53.157 --> 00:47:55.941
and everything's going tits-up, so he yanks

1361
00:47:55.941 --> 00:47:59.059
a cocoon out of his pouch, waves his hand in the air,

1362
00:47:59.059 --> 00:48:01.526
mutters some words, and Beauregard shrinks

1363
00:48:01.526 --> 00:48:05.039
and Nott expands into a massive gigantic green ape.

1364
00:48:05.039 --> 00:48:07.089
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

1365
00:48:07.089 --> 00:48:08.464
SAM: Who, me?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1366
00:48:08.464 --> 00:48:10.296
MATT: Nott becomes a giant ape?

1367
00:48:10.296 --> 00:48:11.441
LIAM: Giant green ape.

1368
00:48:11.441 --> 00:48:12.748
MATT: That definitely breaks you free.

1369
00:48:12.748 --> 00:48:14.439
LAURA: That's awesome.

1370
00:48:14.439 --> 00:48:15.614
MATT: (shattering)
SAM: Oh no.

1371
00:48:15.614 --> 00:48:16.475
MATT: It breaks.
LIAM: Dave!

1372
00:48:16.475 --> 00:48:17.433
LAURA: Oh no.

1373
00:48:17.433 --> 00:48:20.827
MATT: Onto the ground there, and as it does, it shatters

1374
00:48:20.827 --> 00:48:24.592
and you see a torn corpse that has been

1375
00:48:24.592 --> 00:48:26.597
long floating in a murky liquid,

1376
00:48:26.597 --> 00:48:28.207
sprawl on the ground.

1377
00:48:28.207 --> 00:48:29.243
LAURA: Ew, right next to me.

1378
00:48:29.243 --> 00:48:30.119
TALIESIN: ♪ Do you believe ♪

1379
00:48:30.119 --> 00:48:31.779
Wait, no sorry.

1380
00:48:31.779 --> 00:48:33.963
SAM: Did that other body ever do anything?

1381
00:48:33.963 --> 00:48:37.547
(laughter)

1382
00:48:37.547 --> 00:48:38.851
SAM: Mattie?

1383
00:48:38.851 --> 00:48:40.957
MATT: Nothing at the moment, no.

1384
00:48:40.957 --> 00:48:43.604
TRAVIS: That is horrifying to me, standing between

1385
00:48:43.604 --> 00:48:45.314
these two things.

1386
00:48:45.314 --> 00:48:46.365
SAM: I'm a giant ape?

1387
00:48:46.365 --> 00:48:48.367
LIAM: I just texted it to you.

1388
00:48:48.367 --> 00:48:49.738
MATT: Does that finish your turn?

1389
00:48:49.738 --> 00:48:51.086
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, that's it.

1390
00:48:51.086 --> 00:48:52.383
MATT: All right, Fjord, you're up.

1391
00:48:52.383 --> 00:48:53.790
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck this!

1392
00:48:53.790 --> 00:48:57.755
I'll use my relentless hex as a bonus action

1393
00:48:57.755 --> 00:49:00.311
to magically teleport up to 30 feet

1394
00:49:00.311 --> 00:49:02.792
to an unoccupied space you can see

1395
00:49:02.792 --> 00:49:04.214
within five feet of the target

1396
00:49:04.214 --> 00:49:05.609
cursed by my Hexblade's Curse,

1397
00:49:05.609 --> 00:49:07.618
so I'm going to (whoosh) out of his grasp

1398
00:49:07.618 --> 00:49:09.411
and appear right on the other side of him,

1399
00:49:09.411 --> 00:49:10.871
still in his melee range.
MATT: Here?

1400
00:49:10.871 --> 00:49:12.367
TRAVIS: I have to be within five feet of him, yeah.

1401
00:49:12.367 --> 00:49:13.777
Maybe on his backside.

1402
00:49:13.777 --> 00:49:15.080
Is there any edge?
MATT: Okay, so right over here?

1403
00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:16.639
TRAVIS: Yeah, that'd be great.
MATT: Yeah, you can do that.

1404
00:49:16.639 --> 00:49:19.275
You land precariously, almost landing onto

1405
00:49:19.275 --> 00:49:21.331
the jagged glass of one of the destroyed tubes

1406
00:49:21.331 --> 00:49:22.791
behind you and stop yourself.

1407
00:49:22.791 --> 00:49:24.413
TRAVIS: As I reach back, I'll summon the sword

1408
00:49:24.413 --> 00:49:27.043
and do two strikes against his back with the Star Razor.

1409
00:49:27.043 --> 00:49:28.043
MATT: Go for it.

1410
00:49:30.355 --> 00:49:34.733
TRAVIS: That is a 23 to hit and a 27.

1411
00:49:34.733 --> 00:49:35.566
MATT: Both hit.

1412
00:49:35.566 --> 00:49:36.904
TRAVIS: Beautiful.

1413
00:49:36.904 --> 00:49:41.890
First one does 16 plus four, so 20.

1414
00:49:41.890 --> 00:49:42.989
MATT: Ooh.

1415
00:49:42.989 --> 00:49:46.143
TRAVIS: With Hexblade's Curse being the extra four,

1416
00:49:46.143 --> 00:49:49.307
and oh, same exact thing, so 16, wait,

1417
00:49:49.307 --> 00:49:51.040
yeah, 16 plus four, yeah 20.

1418
00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:52.151
So 40 total.

1419
00:49:52.151 --> 00:49:53.224
MATT: Oh.

1420
00:49:53.224 --> 00:49:56.582
As you appear behind it and slice twice,

1421
00:49:56.582 --> 00:49:58.266
you're carving large bits of its body off.

1422
00:49:58.266 --> 00:50:01.693
You can see elements of its back, like trapezius muscle

1423
00:50:01.693 --> 00:50:04.848
slapping onto the wet ground.

1424
00:50:04.848 --> 00:50:06.305
The bone exposed.

1425
00:50:06.305 --> 00:50:07.888
The bone is a tangled mess behind,

1426
00:50:07.888 --> 00:50:09.140
and you can see where some of the ligaments

1427
00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:10.594
are like tangled and knotted.

1428
00:50:10.594 --> 00:50:12.972
It's looking really, really, really bad.

1429
00:50:12.972 --> 00:50:15.240
TRAVIS: Should really see a chiropractor, my friend.

1430
00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:16.256
MATT: That finish your turn?
TRAVIS: Yes.

1431
00:50:16.256 --> 00:50:17.693
MATT: All right, it's now its turn.

1432
00:50:17.693 --> 00:50:18.754
It's going to heal a little bit.

1433
00:50:18.754 --> 00:50:20.275
MARISHA: No.

1434
00:50:20.275 --> 00:50:23.192
MATT: Let's see if it goes in its fearful rage again.

1435
00:50:23.192 --> 00:50:25.700
It is not in its fearful rage.

1436
00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:27.799
TRAVIS: That's not once per day? That's awesome.

1437
00:50:27.799 --> 00:50:29.534
TALIESIN: You do you, getting better every day.

1438
00:50:29.534 --> 00:50:31.808
MATT: All right, it is going to attempt

1439
00:50:31.808 --> 00:50:33.390
to flee this current scenario.

1440
00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:36.601
It's going to attempt to leap back up into the chains.

1441
00:50:36.601 --> 00:50:39.592
Actually, Fjord, the ape, and Beauregard

1442
00:50:39.592 --> 00:50:40.973
all get attacks of opportunity on it.

1443
00:50:40.973 --> 00:50:42.318
SAM: Oh, it's going down.

1444
00:50:42.318 --> 00:50:43.680
MATT: So Beau, you go first.

1445
00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:45.172
MARISHA: Okay.

1446
00:50:45.172 --> 00:50:46.005
Okay.

1447
00:50:46.894 --> 00:50:47.727
Okay.

1448
00:50:48.763 --> 00:50:49.596
15.

1449
00:50:49.596 --> 00:50:51.321
MATT: 15 misses.

1450
00:50:51.321 --> 00:50:52.754
TRAVIS: 22.

1451
00:50:52.754 --> 00:50:54.613
MATT: 22 hits.
TRAVIS: Great.

1452
00:50:54.613 --> 00:50:56.125
SAM: Terrible, 12.

1453
00:50:56.125 --> 00:50:57.219
MATT: 12 misses.

1454
00:50:57.219 --> 00:50:59.901
TRAVIS: 17 plus four, 21.

1455
00:50:59.901 --> 00:51:01.047
MATT: 21 points of damage.

1456
00:51:01.047 --> 00:51:01.888
Ooh, ooh.

1457
00:51:01.888 --> 00:51:03.130
TRAVIS: 10 plus seven plus four.

1458
00:51:03.130 --> 00:51:04.356
LAURA: Kill it, kill it.

1459
00:51:04.356 --> 00:51:05.939
MATT: No.

1460
00:51:05.939 --> 00:51:07.938
But it's close.

1461
00:51:07.938 --> 00:51:09.036
SAM: Stage manager.

1462
00:51:09.036 --> 00:51:11.957
MATT: It's going to leap up into the chains and swing over.

1463
00:51:11.957 --> 00:51:13.376
LAURA: No!

1464
00:51:13.376 --> 00:51:15.284
MATT: Landing right next to you.

1465
00:51:15.284 --> 00:51:16.505
LAURA: No!

1466
00:51:16.505 --> 00:51:18.324
MATT: That magical energy

1467
00:51:18.324 --> 00:51:19.536
that's seeping into its body.

1468
00:51:19.536 --> 00:51:20.969
One of the heads has been like,

1469
00:51:20.969 --> 00:51:22.466
tracing you the whole time.
TALIESIN: It's cool.

1470
00:51:22.466 --> 00:51:24.160
MATT: It's feeling swarmed up top there,

1471
00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:25.974
so it escaped and got up into the chains,

1472
00:51:25.974 --> 00:51:28.226
and the first thing it saw was you moving to that corner

1473
00:51:28.226 --> 00:51:29.646
and just leap down towards you.

1474
00:51:29.646 --> 00:51:32.787
It's going to unleash all of its attacks on you.

1475
00:51:32.787 --> 00:51:34.360
TALIESIN: All right.
LAURA: Oh no, Caduceus!

1476
00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:36.115
TRAVIS: Try talking to him.

1477
00:51:36.115 --> 00:51:37.899
MATT: That is going to be a 20 to hit?

1478
00:51:37.899 --> 00:51:38.925
TALIESIN: 20 hits.

1479
00:51:38.925 --> 00:51:41.018
LAURA: He's got several heads, maybe one of them
will listen.

1480
00:51:41.018 --> 00:51:42.139
MATT: Natural 20.

1481
00:51:42.139 --> 00:51:43.721
TRAVIS: Oh fuck.

1482
00:51:43.721 --> 00:51:45.940
MATT: Actually, I'll do these attacks each time.

1483
00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:48.037
TALIESIN: Actually, yeah.

1484
00:51:48.037 --> 00:51:50.704
MATT: The first one is going to be 11 points

1485
00:51:50.704 --> 00:51:52.449
of bludgeoning damage.
TALIESIN: Reduced by half.

1486
00:51:52.449 --> 00:51:53.557
MATT: Reduced by half.

1487
00:51:53.557 --> 00:51:54.792
TALIESIN: So that's five points.

1488
00:51:54.792 --> 00:51:57.446
Now I have to make a-- hold on, all right.

1489
00:51:57.446 --> 00:51:58.279
MATT: Constitution saving throw.

1490
00:51:58.279 --> 00:51:59.112
TALIESIN: Five damage.

1491
00:51:59.112 --> 00:52:00.832
Constitution saving throw.

1492
00:52:00.832 --> 00:52:03.041
Constitution saving throw, though, I have advantage on.

1493
00:52:03.041 --> 00:52:04.286
MARISHA: Oh, are you war caster?

1494
00:52:04.286 --> 00:52:05.119
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1495
00:52:05.119 --> 00:52:06.320
LAURA: That's cool.
MARISHA: It's the greatest feat.

1496
00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:07.742
TALIESIN: Natural 20.
MARISHA: Yes!

1497
00:52:07.742 --> 00:52:09.187
MATT: Yeah, all right.

1498
00:52:09.187 --> 00:52:11.667
Second attack, which is a natural 20.

1499
00:52:11.667 --> 00:52:13.464
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

1500
00:52:13.464 --> 00:52:15.111
MARISHA: Wait, second attack?

1501
00:52:15.111 --> 00:52:16.257
MATT: It's what it rolled on it.

1502
00:52:16.257 --> 00:52:17.590
It's going to be

1503
00:52:20.371 --> 00:52:23.127
17 points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to half.

1504
00:52:23.127 --> 00:52:24.421
TALIESIN: Reduced to half, so that's--
MATT: Eight.

1505
00:52:24.421 --> 00:52:25.254
TALIESIN: Eight.

1506
00:52:26.169 --> 00:52:31.169
MATT: Roll another constitution saving throw.

1507
00:52:31.742 --> 00:52:32.575
TALIESIN: Nine?

1508
00:52:32.575 --> 00:52:33.408
MATT: Fail.

1509
00:52:33.408 --> 00:52:35.557
TALIESIN: Okay, so no more of that.

1510
00:52:35.557 --> 00:52:37.687
SAM: He's strong again.

1511
00:52:37.687 --> 00:52:38.520
TALIESIN: Cool.

1512
00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:41.066
MATT: Third attack.

1513
00:52:41.066 --> 00:52:43.009
25 to hit.
TALIESIN: That hits.

1514
00:52:43.009 --> 00:52:47.742
MATT: You suffer 14 points of bludgeoning damage.

1515
00:52:47.742 --> 00:52:49.524
TALIESIN: Okay, hold on.

1516
00:52:49.524 --> 00:52:50.995
MATT: Fourth attack's a 27 to hit.

1517
00:52:50.995 --> 00:52:51.828
TALIESIN: That hits.

1518
00:52:51.828 --> 00:52:53.402
God dammit.

1519
00:52:53.402 --> 00:52:55.971
MATT: That is going to be 11 points of bludgeoning damage.

1520
00:52:55.971 --> 00:52:57.916
Fifth attack, 23 to hit.

1521
00:52:57.916 --> 00:52:59.697
TALIESIN: That hits, god dammit.

1522
00:52:59.697 --> 00:53:03.864
MATT: That's going to be 13 points of bludgeoning damage.

1523
00:53:04.708 --> 00:53:06.342
Last strike, which is a bite attack.

1524
00:53:06.342 --> 00:53:09.109
Two of the heads, as it leans forward,

1525
00:53:09.109 --> 00:53:11.245
start gnawing onto the side of your face.

1526
00:53:11.245 --> 00:53:13.374
That's going to be a 20 to hit.

1527
00:53:13.374 --> 00:53:14.869
TALIESIN: God dammit, that hits.

1528
00:53:14.869 --> 00:53:15.967
MATT: All righty.

1529
00:53:15.967 --> 00:53:17.767
This is all d4s.

1530
00:53:20.208 --> 00:53:21.580
He's rolling really good, which is nice.

1531
00:53:21.580 --> 00:53:23.311
SAM: (ape hooting)

1532
00:53:23.311 --> 00:53:25.269
TRAVIS: "He's rolling really good, which is nice."

1533
00:53:25.269 --> 00:53:26.974
MATT: For me, finally, for all the shit you guys did

1534
00:53:26.974 --> 00:53:27.807
the first round.

1535
00:53:27.807 --> 00:53:28.640
LIAM: Bass.

1536
00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:30.030
SAM: (grunting)

1537
00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:33.386
Yeah, but I'm Nott, but I'm not, I'm a goblin.

1538
00:53:33.386 --> 00:53:34.894
MATT: 23 points of piercing damage.

1539
00:53:34.894 --> 00:53:35.727
TALIESIN: Jesus.

1540
00:53:37.390 --> 00:53:38.670
Ow.

1541
00:53:38.670 --> 00:53:40.472
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Ow.

1542
00:53:40.472 --> 00:53:43.071
MATT: It's going to use the rest of its movement

1543
00:53:43.071 --> 00:53:46.101
to just shift around onto this side of you.

1544
00:53:46.101 --> 00:53:48.944
Which, by the way, as it moves,

1545
00:53:48.944 --> 00:53:51.138
it does bring Fjord with it.

1546
00:53:51.138 --> 00:53:52.187
TALIESIN: No.

1547
00:53:52.187 --> 00:53:53.425
MATT: No, that's right, you teleported out of its grip.

1548
00:53:53.425 --> 00:53:54.258
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1549
00:53:54.258 --> 00:53:56.213
MATT: Sorry, I forgot about that.

1550
00:53:56.213 --> 00:53:57.296
TALIESIN: Ow.

1551
00:53:58.495 --> 00:53:59.328
TRAVIS: Understood.

1552
00:53:59.328 --> 00:54:00.161
Understood.

1553
00:54:00.161 --> 00:54:01.529
TALIESIN: Can't take another one of those right now.

1554
00:54:01.529 --> 00:54:04.834
MATT: Caduceus, Jester, you're up.

1555
00:54:04.834 --> 00:54:06.634
TALIESIN: Okay.

1556
00:54:09.033 --> 00:54:10.292
LAURA: You've been going first, so.

1557
00:54:10.292 --> 00:54:12.362
TALIESIN: No, you please, okay, I was about to say.

1558
00:54:12.362 --> 00:54:13.759
Hold on.

1559
00:54:13.759 --> 00:54:15.702
I'm actually tempted to have you go first,

1560
00:54:15.702 --> 00:54:16.959
because I don't know what I'm doing yet,

1561
00:54:16.959 --> 00:54:19.045
because that changed all my plans.

1562
00:54:19.045 --> 00:54:21.545
LAURA: Well, I'm just going to try to--

1563
00:54:23.596 --> 00:54:25.155
I feel like it's lame,

1564
00:54:25.155 --> 00:54:28.333
but I'm going to try to Guiding Bolt him.

1565
00:54:28.333 --> 00:54:29.517
MATT: Go for it.

1566
00:54:29.517 --> 00:54:31.100
Roll for an attack.

1567
00:54:32.523 --> 00:54:33.930
He does not have any additional cover,

1568
00:54:33.930 --> 00:54:34.842
because he's out in the open, he's not--

1569
00:54:34.842 --> 00:54:36.379
LAURA: Right, that's why I'm doing it again.

1570
00:54:36.379 --> 00:54:37.388
TRAVIS: That up the butt or what?

1571
00:54:37.388 --> 00:54:39.091
LAURA: Up the butt!

1572
00:54:39.091 --> 00:54:39.937
25.

1573
00:54:39.937 --> 00:54:41.068
MATT: That hits, go ahead and roll damage.

1574
00:54:41.068 --> 00:54:43.635
MARISHA: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
LAURA: Okay.

1575
00:54:44.666 --> 00:54:46.557
6d6.

1576
00:54:50.137 --> 00:54:51.148
TRAVIS: Whoa.

1577
00:54:51.148 --> 00:54:52.655
LAURA: Okay.

1578
00:54:52.655 --> 00:54:53.578
TALIESIN: That's pretty solid.

1579
00:54:53.578 --> 00:54:58.467
LAURA: 10, 21, 26 points of radiant damage.

1580
00:54:58.467 --> 00:54:59.712
MATT: How do you want to do this?

1581
00:54:59.712 --> 00:55:01.981
(cheering)

1582
00:55:01.981 --> 00:55:03.329
TRAVIS: Yeah!

1583
00:55:03.329 --> 00:55:04.162
LAURA: (gasps)

1584
00:55:04.162 --> 00:55:06.272
TRAVIS: Guiding Bolt, come on.

1585
00:55:06.272 --> 00:55:08.840
LAURA: I'm going to just yell out: Caduceus, duck!

1586
00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:10.858
I'm going to hold my Traveler symbol

1587
00:55:10.858 --> 00:55:15.447
and out shoots like sparkly pink guiding radiant energy.

1588
00:55:15.447 --> 00:55:16.280
TALIESIN: What?

1589
00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:17.113
Oh!

1590
00:55:17.113 --> 00:55:19.436
MATT: Barely missing you by a couple inches,

1591
00:55:19.436 --> 00:55:21.235
you can feel the warmth from the radiant blast

1592
00:55:21.235 --> 00:55:22.969
as it strikes the body of the creature.

1593
00:55:22.969 --> 00:55:25.693
LAURA: One teeny unicorn with double heads smiles

1594
00:55:25.693 --> 00:55:28.701
and escapes and flies forward as well.

1595
00:55:28.701 --> 00:55:30.031
MARISHA: Whee!

1596
00:55:30.031 --> 00:55:33.862
MATT: As the beam burns into its body, as it strikes,

1597
00:55:33.862 --> 00:55:36.878
the energy sparkles, you hear almost the sound of a harp,

1598
00:55:36.878 --> 00:55:38.673
and as the energy eventually dissipates,

1599
00:55:38.673 --> 00:55:40.930
you can see the large hole in its torso

1600
00:55:40.930 --> 00:55:43.680
where the blast was, and the body

1601
00:55:44.526 --> 00:55:45.819
collapses to the ground.

1602
00:55:45.819 --> 00:55:46.652
TRAVIS: Ooh!

1603
00:55:48.213 --> 00:55:52.637
SAM: (ape noises)

1604
00:55:52.637 --> 00:55:53.470
LAURA: Oh!

1605
00:55:54.411 --> 00:55:55.981
You're cute.

1606
00:55:55.981 --> 00:55:57.951
TRAVIS: Is that corpse that spilled out over there

1607
00:55:57.951 --> 00:56:01.476
from the crashed tube, is it moving? Lying still?

1608
00:56:01.476 --> 00:56:03.273
MATT: You go ahead and check it out?

1609
00:56:03.273 --> 00:56:04.334
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'd like to.

1610
00:56:04.334 --> 00:56:05.167
MATT: Okay.

1611
00:56:05.167 --> 00:56:06.853
You head on over to this one over here?

1612
00:56:06.853 --> 00:56:07.787
TRAVIS: Yep.

1613
00:56:07.787 --> 00:56:10.242
MATT: All right, you move over and look at the corpse.

1614
00:56:10.242 --> 00:56:11.413
TRAVIS: Sword forward.

1615
00:56:11.413 --> 00:56:13.295
MATT: Sword forward.

1616
00:56:13.295 --> 00:56:15.329
No, it's not moving.

1617
00:56:15.329 --> 00:56:16.756
TRAVIS: Poke.

1618
00:56:16.756 --> 00:56:18.870
MATT: (squelches)

1619
00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:20.587
It's been long dead.

1620
00:56:20.587 --> 00:56:23.112
TALIESIN: Poke this thing really quickly with my stick

1621
00:56:23.112 --> 00:56:24.132
just to see if it's doing anything

1622
00:56:24.132 --> 00:56:25.378
or trying to heal or anything.

1623
00:56:25.378 --> 00:56:26.742
MATT: The creature on the ground next to you?

1624
00:56:26.742 --> 00:56:28.544
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: Okay, you poke it with a stick.

1625
00:56:28.544 --> 00:56:29.865
One of the hands grabs it.

1626
00:56:29.865 --> 00:56:31.748
Nobody's done anything in the interim,

1627
00:56:31.748 --> 00:56:34.641
it's healed a little bit. It's now back to its turn.

1628
00:56:34.641 --> 00:56:37.221
(shouting)

1629
00:56:37.221 --> 00:56:40.376
TALIESIN: Was that really six entire seconds?

1630
00:56:40.376 --> 00:56:42.457
I feel like I would've done that instantly, to be fair.

1631
00:56:42.457 --> 00:56:43.331
MATT: Right.

1632
00:56:43.331 --> 00:56:45.052
I was waiting for anyone to do anything,

1633
00:56:45.052 --> 00:56:47.408
and no one thought to do anything in the standpoint.

1634
00:56:47.408 --> 00:56:49.347
Gets back up.

1635
00:56:49.347 --> 00:56:51.272
LIAM: Poke with a stick doesn't stop it from healing.

1636
00:56:51.272 --> 00:56:53.467
TALIESIN: Okay, so it did grab the stick

1637
00:56:53.467 --> 00:56:54.414
and is back up.

1638
00:56:54.414 --> 00:56:55.260
MATT: It's back up.

1639
00:56:55.260 --> 00:56:58.155
TALIESIN: Where in the round are we right now?

1640
00:56:58.155 --> 00:57:02.331
MATT: We're technically finished with Jester's turn,

1641
00:57:02.331 --> 00:57:05.311
a round went by without anything happening,

1642
00:57:05.311 --> 00:57:07.755
it healed top of its turn, so it's top of its turn.

1643
00:57:07.755 --> 00:57:10.436
TALIESIN: Well, I'm fuckin' out.

1644
00:57:10.436 --> 00:57:15.436
MATT: It's going to go ahead and make first attack

1645
00:57:15.597 --> 00:57:16.793
against you, Caduceus.

1646
00:57:16.793 --> 00:57:18.288
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah, I'm all ready.

1647
00:57:18.288 --> 00:57:19.970
MATT: See if it goes into its fearful rage.

1648
00:57:19.970 --> 00:57:21.465
It does get into its fearful rage,

1649
00:57:21.465 --> 00:57:23.335
so it has advantage on its attack rolls.

1650
00:57:23.335 --> 00:57:24.994
MARISHA: You're going to go down.

1651
00:57:24.994 --> 00:57:26.055
MATT: That's 28.

1652
00:57:26.055 --> 00:57:27.200
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, that hits.

1653
00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:28.734
MATT: All right, Caduceus.

1654
00:57:28.734 --> 00:57:31.104
That is 10 points of bludgeoning damage.

1655
00:57:31.104 --> 00:57:32.189
TALIESIN: Okay.

1656
00:57:32.189 --> 00:57:34.694
MATT: Second attack against you, 22.

1657
00:57:34.694 --> 00:57:36.827
TALIESIN: That also hits.

1658
00:57:36.827 --> 00:57:38.936
MATT: You take 15 points of bludgeoning damage.

1659
00:57:38.936 --> 00:57:40.468
TALIESIN: I'm out.

1660
00:57:40.468 --> 00:57:42.414
MATT: You watch as it tears into Caduceus,

1661
00:57:42.414 --> 00:57:44.022
peeling back some of the armor,

1662
00:57:44.022 --> 00:57:46.590
and one of the hands stabs into the torso,

1663
00:57:46.590 --> 00:57:48.612
he yelps out and then falls unconscious on the ground.

1664
00:57:48.612 --> 00:57:50.830
That arm just grabs onto his body,

1665
00:57:50.830 --> 00:57:53.062
he's going to turn towards the two of you,

1666
00:57:53.062 --> 00:57:55.519
and then leap through the rest of the way,

1667
00:57:55.519 --> 00:57:58.683
holding Caduceus's unconscious body.

1668
00:57:58.683 --> 00:58:00.203
LAURA: Oh god.
SAM: Oh god.

1669
00:58:00.203 --> 00:58:01.516
MATT: With him.

1670
00:58:02.416 --> 00:58:04.969
With that, it's going to go ahead and make,

1671
00:58:04.969 --> 00:58:06.314
that was three attacks, right?

1672
00:58:06.314 --> 00:58:07.908
Or was that two.
TALIESIN: That was two.

1673
00:58:07.908 --> 00:58:10.180
MATT: That was two attacks, so it has four more.

1674
00:58:10.180 --> 00:58:13.619
It's going to do all attacks on Jester,

1675
00:58:13.619 --> 00:58:15.495
since you're the one that took it out last round.

1676
00:58:15.495 --> 00:58:16.453
LAURA: Cool.

1677
00:58:16.453 --> 00:58:18.778
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, tight, tight.

1678
00:58:18.778 --> 00:58:20.361
MATT: 22 to hit.
LAURA: Hits.

1679
00:58:22.381 --> 00:58:23.964
MATT: 25 to hit.
LAURA: Hits.

1680
00:58:25.398 --> 00:58:27.052
MATT: 22 to hit.
LAURA: Uh-huh.

1681
00:58:27.052 --> 00:58:28.425
MATT: Has advantage on all these, so those

1682
00:58:28.425 --> 00:58:30.854
are the bludgeoning attacks, which would be

1683
00:58:30.854 --> 00:58:32.016
11 points of bludgeoning damage.

1684
00:58:32.016 --> 00:58:34.282
LAURA: Okay, on this first one I'm going to use
Hellish Rebuke.

1685
00:58:34.282 --> 00:58:35.467
MATT: Go for it.

1686
00:58:35.467 --> 00:58:37.733
SAM: Doesn't hurt him, does it?

1687
00:58:37.733 --> 00:58:38.566
LAURA: I don't know.

1688
00:58:38.566 --> 00:58:41.056
TALIESIN: This might solve everything.

1689
00:58:41.056 --> 00:58:42.223
LAURA: That's 3d10.

1690
00:58:43.537 --> 00:58:45.157
MATT: Constitution saving throw for him or dexterity?

1691
00:58:45.157 --> 00:58:46.865
LAURA: Dex, dex.
MATT: Dex.

1692
00:58:46.865 --> 00:58:47.974
That is a six.

1693
00:58:47.974 --> 00:58:49.292
LAURA: Oh, good!

1694
00:58:49.292 --> 00:58:51.465
Where'd it go? Oh, it's on me.

1695
00:58:51.465 --> 00:58:53.111
TRAVIS: Smoke this fuckin' thing.

1696
00:58:53.111 --> 00:58:54.071
LAURA: Oh, good!

1697
00:58:54.071 --> 00:58:57.128
16, 20 points of cold damage.

1698
00:58:57.128 --> 00:58:57.961
MATT: How do you want to do this?

1699
00:58:57.961 --> 00:59:00.581
(cheering)

1700
00:59:00.581 --> 00:59:01.865
LAURA: Ah!

1701
00:59:01.865 --> 00:59:03.717
I'm going to see Caduceus flopping around,

1702
00:59:03.717 --> 00:59:07.033
I'm going to look over at Fjord and go like: oh my god!

1703
00:59:07.033 --> 00:59:09.810
And I'm going to scream out cold energy

1704
00:59:09.810 --> 00:59:10.791
from my mouth.

1705
00:59:10.791 --> 00:59:13.934
MATT: As you scream, the symbol sparks blue,

1706
00:59:13.934 --> 00:59:17.438
your interior tiefling energy comes through in a blast

1707
00:59:17.438 --> 00:59:21.108
of jagged ice, fires outward into the creature's face.

1708
00:59:21.108 --> 00:59:23.822
He gets pushed back a bit, its arm up against the door,

1709
00:59:23.822 --> 00:59:26.403
tries to move, and then

1710
00:59:26.403 --> 00:59:27.587
flops back up onto the ground.

1711
00:59:27.587 --> 00:59:29.409
LAURA: Chop it up, chop it up, chop it up!

1712
00:59:29.409 --> 00:59:30.242
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

1713
00:59:30.242 --> 00:59:32.424
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, the Star Razor just starts whacking

1714
00:59:32.424 --> 00:59:34.496
at like limbs and heads and--

1715
00:59:34.496 --> 00:59:35.617
LAURA: Avoid Caduceus.

1716
00:59:35.617 --> 00:59:36.765
MATT: Okay, what's everybody else doing?

1717
00:59:36.765 --> 00:59:40.348
MARISHA: Can I grab the dagger from Nott's--

1718
00:59:41.451 --> 00:59:42.637
SAM: I don't have any equipment on me.

1719
00:59:42.637 --> 00:59:43.734
MATT: He is a giant ape.

1720
00:59:43.734 --> 00:59:44.942
LAURA: You need to rip him apart.

1721
00:59:44.942 --> 00:59:47.448
SAM: I'm going to go over and just stomp on him.

1722
00:59:47.448 --> 00:59:48.996
MATT: Okay, you're all just bludgeoning it.

1723
00:59:48.996 --> 00:59:51.478
SAM: Like the beginning of 2001, and then smashing.

1724
00:59:51.478 --> 00:59:52.783
MATT: Anybody else?

1725
00:59:52.783 --> 00:59:54.954
LIAM: Willi is doing the same thing,

1726
00:59:54.954 --> 00:59:56.386
he's just punching the chunks.

1727
00:59:56.386 --> 00:59:57.960
LAURA: Try to remove his heart or something.

1728
00:59:57.960 --> 01:00:01.199
Remove the part that's will bring him back.

1729
01:00:01.199 --> 01:00:02.197
MATT: Okay.

1730
01:00:02.197 --> 01:00:03.220
TALIESIN: I'm just out.

1731
01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:04.504
MATT: So Beau?

1732
01:00:04.504 --> 01:00:08.020
MARISHA: I'm going to go over and
take my staff and start

1733
01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:10.159
pummeling his head into paste.

1734
01:00:10.159 --> 01:00:11.649
LAURA: Try to cut his heart out, cut his heart out!
MATT: All right.

1735
01:00:11.649 --> 01:00:12.989
MARISHA: Is his chest exposed?

1736
01:00:12.989 --> 01:00:14.513
MATT: Yeah, it's bludgeoned.

1737
01:00:14.513 --> 01:00:16.857
MARISHA: Can I do like what I did before, reach in?

1738
01:00:16.857 --> 01:00:17.690
MATT: Make a medicine check.

1739
01:00:17.690 --> 01:00:19.099
You have no idea where any of his biology is.

1740
01:00:19.099 --> 01:00:20.320
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll make a medicine check.

1741
01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:21.528
MATT: Go for it.
MARISHA: Why not?

1742
01:00:21.528 --> 01:00:22.838
MATT: Caleb, what are you doing?

1743
01:00:22.838 --> 01:00:25.680
LIAM: I'm summoning Frumpkin and having Frumpkin

1744
01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:29.353
bat one at a time at each of these tubes

1745
01:00:29.353 --> 01:00:30.966
with things in them.

1746
01:00:30.966 --> 01:00:34.116
LAURA: I'm going to run over to Caduceus.
LIAM: One by one to see if anything.

1747
01:00:35.693 --> 01:00:37.899
LAURA: If I have it prepared, holy shit, I don't know if I--

1748
01:00:37.899 --> 01:00:39.583
okay, I'm going to Cure Wounds him.

1749
01:00:39.583 --> 01:00:40.791
MATT: Okay, go for it.

1750
01:00:40.791 --> 01:00:41.624
LAURA: Okay.

1751
01:00:41.624 --> 01:00:45.306
MATT: You move over to poor Caduceus around the back side.

1752
01:00:45.306 --> 01:00:46.849
You got it, all right.

1753
01:00:46.849 --> 01:00:49.161
The creature heals up again next round.

1754
01:00:49.161 --> 01:00:50.473
MARISHA: Wait, wait, 15, 15.

1755
01:00:50.473 --> 01:00:52.484
MATT: You can see where that is a heart,

1756
01:00:52.484 --> 01:00:54.354
but that was your action to look into there.

1757
01:00:54.354 --> 01:00:55.453
SAM: It heals up again?
MATT: Yeah.

1758
01:00:55.453 --> 01:00:56.856
SAM: Even though we're killing it?

1759
01:00:56.856 --> 01:00:58.232
LAURA: We got to get his heart out.

1760
01:00:58.232 --> 01:00:59.991
MARISHA: Is my hand in his chest?

1761
01:00:59.991 --> 01:01:01.961
MATT: As you're hitting it and carving into it,

1762
01:01:01.961 --> 01:01:05.218
parts of it are still healing up and pulling together.

1763
01:01:05.218 --> 01:01:08.691
You guys aren't stopping it from healing.

1764
01:01:08.691 --> 01:01:12.004
It gets back up with half of its movement.

1765
01:01:12.004 --> 01:01:14.165
LAURA: But he would've let go of
Caduceus in the amount of time--

1766
01:01:14.165 --> 01:01:17.206
MATT: Yeah, Caduceus is no longer held.

1767
01:01:17.206 --> 01:01:19.701
Getting up and having Fjord, it's going to

1768
01:01:19.701 --> 01:01:21.723
unleash entirely on Fjord.

1769
01:01:21.723 --> 01:01:22.695
TRAVIS: Cool.

1770
01:01:22.695 --> 01:01:23.954
MATT: Actually, you know what?

1771
01:01:23.954 --> 01:01:28.954
Roll a d6 for me, Caduceus.

1772
01:01:28.954 --> 01:01:30.910
LIAM: Are we standing in water, by the way?

1773
01:01:30.910 --> 01:01:32.443
MATT: Yeah, partial water, yeah.

1774
01:01:32.443 --> 01:01:33.929
LAURA: Roll a d6.

1775
01:01:33.929 --> 01:01:34.763
TALIESIN: Four.

1776
01:01:34.763 --> 01:01:35.846
MATT: Four, okay.

1777
01:01:36.894 --> 01:01:39.327
It's going after Willi.

1778
01:01:39.327 --> 01:01:40.665
TALIESIN: No.

1779
01:01:40.665 --> 01:01:42.270
MATT: All attacks on Willi.

1780
01:01:42.270 --> 01:01:44.787
As it gets up and just starts smashing into him.

1781
01:01:44.787 --> 01:01:45.747
TRAVIS: Oh no, not Willi.

1782
01:01:45.747 --> 01:01:46.830
MARISHA: Sentinel strike.

1783
01:01:46.830 --> 01:01:48.303
MATT: Yep, you do.

1784
01:01:48.303 --> 01:01:50.261
So first attack.

1785
01:01:50.261 --> 01:01:52.330
Oh, let's see if it gets into its rage.

1786
01:01:52.330 --> 01:01:53.727
Nope, it does not, so it's just single attack.

1787
01:01:53.727 --> 01:01:55.347
So that's 18 against?

1788
01:01:55.347 --> 01:01:57.090
LIAM: Hits.

1789
01:01:57.090 --> 01:01:58.257
MATT: Willi takes...

1790
01:02:02.033 --> 01:02:03.537
13 points of bludgeoning damage.

1791
01:02:03.537 --> 01:02:06.320
MARISHA: Sentinel, right?
MATT: Yep.

1792
01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:08.539
MARISHA: It was almost a natural 20 again.

1793
01:02:08.539 --> 01:02:09.571
18?

1794
01:02:09.571 --> 01:02:10.932
MATT: 18 just hits.

1795
01:02:10.932 --> 01:02:12.876
MARISHA: 12 damage?

1796
01:02:12.876 --> 01:02:17.377
MATT: You slam into him. He's still standing.

1797
01:02:17.377 --> 01:02:19.710
Second attack against Willi.

1798
01:02:21.241 --> 01:02:22.074
21.
LIAM: Hits.

1799
01:02:22.949 --> 01:02:26.788
MATT: Takes 14 points of bludgeoning damage.

1800
01:02:26.788 --> 01:02:29.702
Third attack against Willi is going to be 14.

1801
01:02:29.702 --> 01:02:30.535
LIAM: No.

1802
01:02:30.535 --> 01:02:32.270
MATT: Misses, the fourth attack.

1803
01:02:32.270 --> 01:02:33.332
26.

1804
01:02:33.332 --> 01:02:34.628
LIAM: No.

1805
01:02:34.628 --> 01:02:36.199
MATT: (laughs)

1806
01:02:36.199 --> 01:02:37.311
15 points of bludgeoning damage.

1807
01:02:37.311 --> 01:02:38.817
LIAM: Yeah, okay.

1808
01:02:38.817 --> 01:02:41.742
LIAM: That's going to be 15 to hit?

1809
01:02:41.742 --> 01:02:43.267
LIAM: No.
MATT: Misses.

1810
01:02:43.267 --> 01:02:45.599
The final attack's going to be its bite attack.

1811
01:02:45.599 --> 01:02:47.332
26.
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

1812
01:02:54.352 --> 01:02:56.285
TRAVIS: (whispering) I can Banish him.

1813
01:02:57.452 --> 01:02:58.977
MARISHA: For six seconds?

1814
01:03:00.374 --> 01:03:01.856
MATT: 13 points of piercing damage.

1815
01:03:01.856 --> 01:03:03.919
LIAM: Okay, Willi is very mangled,

1816
01:03:03.919 --> 01:03:06.188
but is teetering around on his legs.

1817
01:03:06.188 --> 01:03:07.498
MATT: All righty.

1818
01:03:07.498 --> 01:03:10.528
That brings us to, Caduceus and Jester are up next.

1819
01:03:10.528 --> 01:03:11.889
Any combat order.

1820
01:03:11.889 --> 01:03:15.698
TALIESIN: I'm awake, but badly damaged.

1821
01:03:15.698 --> 01:03:16.654
Okay.

1822
01:03:18.432 --> 01:03:20.079
Do you want to go first while I figure this out?

1823
01:03:20.079 --> 01:03:22.057
I'm so sorry.
LAURA: Sure.

1824
01:03:22.057 --> 01:03:22.976
I'm going to--

1825
01:03:22.976 --> 01:03:24.975
SAM: Get another "how do you want to do this?"

1826
01:03:24.975 --> 01:03:27.303
LAURA: I'm just going to Guiding Bolt
him at 1st level this time.

1827
01:03:27.303 --> 01:03:29.791
MATT: At this point, the body's torn apart,

1828
01:03:29.791 --> 01:03:31.191
and like the legs aren't even there,

1829
01:03:31.191 --> 01:03:33.013
it's not even moving, it's just the arms and the torso

1830
01:03:33.013 --> 01:03:34.260
that are trying to bludgeon and tear

1831
01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:35.254
whatever's in the vicinity.
LAURA: 23.

1832
01:03:35.254 --> 01:03:36.340
MATT: It's like a feral creature.

1833
01:03:36.340 --> 01:03:37.173
That hits.

1834
01:03:37.173 --> 01:03:38.458
LAURA: 23, okay.
SAM: Free Willi.

1835
01:03:38.458 --> 01:03:40.266
LAURA: That's 4d6.

1836
01:03:42.102 --> 01:03:45.304
Okay, 12, 14, 16 points of damage.

1837
01:03:45.304 --> 01:03:46.201
MATT: How do you want to do this?

1838
01:03:46.201 --> 01:03:47.548
(laughter)

1839
01:03:47.548 --> 01:03:49.669
MATT: It's just the torso now, yanking,

1840
01:03:49.669 --> 01:03:50.927
parts of it just dangling.

1841
01:03:50.927 --> 01:03:53.397
LAURA: Oh my god, just die already!

1842
01:03:53.397 --> 01:03:55.353
I'm going to hit him again, and like the minute

1843
01:03:55.353 --> 01:03:57.573
he like starts to fall, I'm going to run forward

1844
01:03:57.573 --> 01:03:59.471
with my ax and try to cut into his chest

1845
01:03:59.471 --> 01:04:00.840
to get his heart out.
MATT: Okay, got you.

1846
01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:03.391
As you burn into it, two of the heads

1847
01:04:03.391 --> 01:04:05.328
smolder into ash, the skulls left behind

1848
01:04:05.328 --> 01:04:07.770
now dangling loose across its mostly mangled body.

1849
01:04:07.770 --> 01:04:09.367
You rush forward and start hacking into it.

1850
01:04:09.367 --> 01:04:11.002
What's everybody else doing?

1851
01:04:11.002 --> 01:04:12.546
LIAM: Willi's up next, I think.

1852
01:04:12.546 --> 01:04:13.380
Oh no, Caduceus.

1853
01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:14.666
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm up next.

1854
01:04:14.666 --> 01:04:16.011
SAM: I'm going to take a head off.

1855
01:04:16.011 --> 01:04:18.617
MARISHA: I want to leave, and I want
to go over to this table over here

1856
01:04:18.617 --> 01:04:22.052
and investigate if I can find any notes,

1857
01:04:22.052 --> 01:04:25.200
anything about what will stop him.

1858
01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:26.450
MATT: I will say...

1859
01:04:30.087 --> 01:04:31.855
Everyone make an intelligence check.

1860
01:04:31.855 --> 01:04:33.230
(laughter)

1861
01:04:33.230 --> 01:04:34.677
TALIESIN: Should I even bother?

1862
01:04:34.677 --> 01:04:35.611
LAURA: I know, right?

1863
01:04:35.611 --> 01:04:36.996
Me and you, buddy.

1864
01:04:36.996 --> 01:04:37.829
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

1865
01:04:37.829 --> 01:04:39.514
LAURA: Ooh!

1866
01:04:39.514 --> 01:04:40.605
LIAM: 16.

1867
01:04:40.605 --> 01:04:41.727
LAURA: 17.

1868
01:04:41.727 --> 01:04:42.612
TALIESIN: 11.

1869
01:04:42.612 --> 01:04:43.808
SAM: 17.

1870
01:04:43.808 --> 01:04:45.638
MARISHA: 19.
TRAVIS: 23 total.

1871
01:04:45.638 --> 01:04:48.422
MATT: Fjord, you recall from a previous encounter

1872
01:04:48.422 --> 01:04:50.578
you guys had in a swamp long ago,

1873
01:04:50.578 --> 01:04:53.036
with a troll-type creature that seemed to regenerate

1874
01:04:53.036 --> 01:04:57.369
repeatedly from death,

1875
01:04:57.369 --> 01:04:58.435
that fire and acid

1876
01:04:58.435 --> 01:05:00.317
were the two things that seemed to keep it

1877
01:05:00.317 --> 01:05:01.875
from restoring its body.

1878
01:05:01.875 --> 01:05:05.965
TRAVIS: My man, I got no fire, I got no nothing.

1879
01:05:05.965 --> 01:05:08.558
MARISHA: Do I see any jars of acid over there, okay?

1880
01:05:08.558 --> 01:05:11.100
MATT: You, make an investigation check.

1881
01:05:11.100 --> 01:05:12.346
SAM: I'm still trying to pull off a head.

1882
01:05:12.346 --> 01:05:15.226
LAURA: I'm cutting into its chest.

1883
01:05:15.226 --> 01:05:17.648
MARISHA: Well, I mean, that too.

1884
01:05:17.648 --> 01:05:21.129
TRAVIS: I have the Glove of Blasting still.

1885
01:05:21.129 --> 01:05:22.149
MARISHA: 16.

1886
01:05:22.149 --> 01:05:23.575
LAURA: I mean, Caleb can fire him.

1887
01:05:23.575 --> 01:05:24.408
TRAVIS: Yeah, we both do.

1888
01:05:24.408 --> 01:05:25.241
MATT: You look around and you do see there are

1889
01:05:25.241 --> 01:05:26.612
a couple of jars of chemicals.

1890
01:05:26.612 --> 01:05:28.033
Most of this table's been overturned

1891
01:05:28.033 --> 01:05:28.957
and been shattered on the ground.

1892
01:05:28.957 --> 01:05:30.798
There's two jars on the ground.

1893
01:05:30.798 --> 01:05:32.182
You pick up one. Pick it up,

1894
01:05:32.182 --> 01:05:33.791
it smells like some sort of formaldehyde.

1895
01:05:33.791 --> 01:05:36.047
The other one you pick up, and it does have a very caustic--

1896
01:05:36.047 --> 01:05:38.540
it immediately burns your nose in a way

1897
01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:40.515
that's probably going to linger for a while.

1898
01:05:40.515 --> 01:05:41.652
TRAVIS: With that intelligence check,

1899
01:05:41.652 --> 01:05:43.063
can I look at the Glove of Blasting

1900
01:05:43.063 --> 01:05:46.765
and send the Scorching Ray towards it?

1901
01:05:46.765 --> 01:05:48.100
MATT: Sure, if you want to.

1902
01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:50.183
TRAVIS: Okay, good, one charge.

1903
01:05:51.546 --> 01:05:53.762
It's just automatic, or do I roll to hit?

1904
01:05:53.762 --> 01:05:56.365
MATT: You roll to hit, with advantage on each of these,

1905
01:05:56.365 --> 01:06:01.365
because it is technically prone and unconscious, yeah.

1906
01:06:01.576 --> 01:06:02.485
TRAVIS: Okay.

1907
01:06:02.485 --> 01:06:05.950
SAM: ♪ Totally automatic ♪

1908
01:06:05.950 --> 01:06:08.794
TRAVIS: Plus nine, so this is a 20 to hit?

1909
01:06:08.794 --> 01:06:10.203
MATT: Yeah, that hits.

1910
01:06:10.203 --> 01:06:11.362
TRAVIS: Do I roll three times?

1911
01:06:11.362 --> 01:06:12.545
MATT: Three times, three blasts.

1912
01:06:12.545 --> 01:06:13.744
TRAVIS: So 20 to hit.

1913
01:06:13.744 --> 01:06:15.654
Ooh, that's not as good, 14.

1914
01:06:15.654 --> 01:06:16.720
MATT: 14 misses.

1915
01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:17.745
LAURA: But it's still up, right?

1916
01:06:17.745 --> 01:06:18.925
Wait, oh, no it's not.

1917
01:06:18.925 --> 01:06:21.290
TRAVIS: And a 27.

1918
01:06:21.290 --> 01:06:22.255
MATT: 27, all right.

1919
01:06:22.255 --> 01:06:23.088
TRAVIS: Two of them hit, right?

1920
01:06:23.088 --> 01:06:25.220
MATT: Yep, so that's 4d6 fire damage.

1921
01:06:25.220 --> 01:06:27.117
TRAVIS: 4d6, great.

1922
01:06:27.117 --> 01:06:28.108
Awesome.

1923
01:06:30.589 --> 01:06:33.436
Four, nine, 11. 11 points of fire damage.

1924
01:06:33.436 --> 01:06:35.034
MATT: 11 points of fire damage, all right.

1925
01:06:35.034 --> 01:06:36.753
Go ahead and roll damage for your hand ax.

1926
01:06:36.753 --> 01:06:40.171
TRAVIS: That's a total of 15 because of the
Hexblade's Curse,

1927
01:06:40.171 --> 01:06:41.864
I'm assuming is still on it.

1928
01:06:41.864 --> 01:06:42.862
MATT: Technically, yeah.

1929
01:06:42.862 --> 01:06:44.634
So it would be 15 total.

1930
01:06:44.634 --> 01:06:45.467
What'd you roll?

1931
01:06:45.467 --> 01:06:46.690
LAURA: Would I roll at advantage because he's--

1932
01:06:46.690 --> 01:06:47.523
MATT: Yep.

1933
01:06:48.624 --> 01:06:50.803
LAURA: So 16.

1934
01:06:50.803 --> 01:06:52.251
MATT: 16 misses, I'm sorry.

1935
01:06:52.251 --> 01:06:53.960
LAURA: I miss him when he's on the fucking ground

1936
01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:55.156
and he's dead. I miss him.

1937
01:06:55.156 --> 01:06:59.561
MATT: Well, it's a melee attack and he's unconscious.

1938
01:06:59.561 --> 01:07:00.632
SAM: He's a bag of guts.

1939
01:07:00.632 --> 01:07:01.869
MATT: Yeah, no it is, yeah.

1940
01:07:01.869 --> 01:07:04.477
LAURA: I just go: ah! I hit my leg.

1941
01:07:04.477 --> 01:07:06.654
MATT: You're hitting places that just aren't--

1942
01:07:06.654 --> 01:07:07.906
LAURA: I think that when I was a kid,

1943
01:07:07.906 --> 01:07:10.292
I hit with a hammer in a sandbox,

1944
01:07:10.292 --> 01:07:12.259
and I missed the sand and I slammed the hammer

1945
01:07:12.259 --> 01:07:13.241
into my own--
SAM: You missed the sand?

1946
01:07:13.241 --> 01:07:14.824
LAURA: I missed the sand and hit my own leg.

1947
01:07:14.824 --> 01:07:15.757
SAM: In a sandbox.
LAURA: Yeah.

1948
01:07:15.757 --> 01:07:17.969
MATT: How do you want to do this?

1949
01:07:19.019 --> 01:07:22.200
TRAVIS: I just reach out the hand and like (impacts).

1950
01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:24.400
With the spit.

1951
01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:26.399
MATT: As the two that do strike blast,

1952
01:07:26.399 --> 01:07:29.333
the body ignites, and you hear this high-pitched screeching.

1953
01:07:29.333 --> 01:07:31.713
(screeching)

1954
01:07:31.713 --> 01:07:33.304
TRAVIS: Ah?

1955
01:07:33.304 --> 01:07:35.171
MATT: Eventually, you see his body trying to get,

1956
01:07:35.171 --> 01:07:37.368
the torso trying to claw its way across the ground,

1957
01:07:37.368 --> 01:07:38.447
but the flames eventually burn

1958
01:07:38.447 --> 01:07:39.748
as you guys are hacking into it.

1959
01:07:39.748 --> 01:07:43.217
It stops moving, collapses, and is now a ruined smolder,

1960
01:07:43.217 --> 01:07:46.657
no longer regenerating, and is dead.

1961
01:07:46.657 --> 01:07:48.691
TRAVIS: Hey!

1962
01:07:48.691 --> 01:07:50.602
MARISHA: Hey guys, I found acid.

1963
01:07:50.602 --> 01:07:52.088
LAURA: I still try to cut his heart out, though.

1964
01:07:52.088 --> 01:07:56.718
TRAVIS: Great. I regain 14 hit points from Hexblade's Curse.

1965
01:07:56.718 --> 01:07:59.194
SAM: Yes.
TRAVIS: Thank you.

1966
01:07:59.194 --> 01:08:01.306
MARISHA: (sighs)
TALIESIN: Oh.

1967
01:08:01.306 --> 01:08:02.804
MATT: That was fine.

1968
01:08:02.804 --> 01:08:04.599
TRAVIS: That actually was amazing.

1969
01:08:04.599 --> 01:08:05.832
MATT: You're still an ape.

1970
01:08:05.832 --> 01:08:07.147
SAM: Still an ape.

1971
01:08:07.147 --> 01:08:12.147
TRAVIS: Beau, do you see anything
over there by the fucking table?

1972
01:08:12.147 --> 01:08:15.459
MARISHA: Let me-- I'm going to go look again.

1973
01:08:15.459 --> 01:08:19.863
Now that I'm not under-- I found this acid.

1974
01:08:19.863 --> 01:08:23.428
I was a little like late to the party.

1975
01:08:23.428 --> 01:08:26.100
But we have acid now.

1976
01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:27.949
I think my rib is broken.

1977
01:08:27.949 --> 01:08:28.964
TRAVIS: Yeah.

1978
01:08:28.964 --> 01:08:31.749
Should we check the rest of the canisters, and I'll--

1979
01:08:31.749 --> 01:08:34.142
SAM: I'm going to go smash all the canisters.

1980
01:08:34.142 --> 01:08:36.997
TRAVIS: I'll hold the glowing sword up against the chains--

1981
01:08:36.997 --> 01:08:39.449
LAURA: Rip his ribs out to try to get to the heart.

1982
01:08:39.449 --> 01:08:40.941
SAM: Oh god.

1983
01:08:40.941 --> 01:08:43.522
MATT: You tear open, and you do find

1984
01:08:43.522 --> 01:08:45.205
a cluster of four hearts.

1985
01:08:45.205 --> 01:08:46.038
LAURA: Whoa!

1986
01:08:46.038 --> 01:08:48.154
MATT: That are slertly-- slightly merged.

1987
01:08:48.154 --> 01:08:49.779
MARISHA and MATT: Slertly.

1988
01:08:49.779 --> 01:08:51.412
TALIESIN: (hearts beating)

1989
01:08:51.412 --> 01:08:52.573
MATT: Well, they're not beating.

1990
01:08:52.573 --> 01:08:54.838
TALIESIN: (hearts beating)

1991
01:08:54.838 --> 01:08:59.168
MATT: It's like a jazz heart. They just like (laughs).

1992
01:08:59.168 --> 01:09:01.162
MARISHA: Can I go back over and investigate this table

1993
01:09:01.162 --> 01:09:02.961
with more time now?

1994
01:09:02.961 --> 01:09:04.321
MATT: Sure.
MARISHA: Okay.

1995
01:09:04.321 --> 01:09:06.167
Notes, research?

1996
01:09:06.167 --> 01:09:09.829
MATT: There are papers around the floor area.

1997
01:09:09.829 --> 01:09:10.814
Most everything's been overturned,

1998
01:09:10.814 --> 01:09:12.819
most of these tables are empty or knocked over.

1999
01:09:12.819 --> 01:09:15.151
Everything has been sitting in whatever solution

2000
01:09:15.151 --> 01:09:17.395
covers the bottom and has been destroyed.

2001
01:09:17.395 --> 01:09:18.891
You spend a short time looking around

2002
01:09:18.891 --> 01:09:23.678
and there is nothing notable or legible that remains.

2003
01:09:23.678 --> 01:09:25.546
You grab a sheet of paper or notes

2004
01:09:25.546 --> 01:09:26.848
and it just deteriorates in your hands

2005
01:09:26.848 --> 01:09:28.006
as you lift it out of the water.

2006
01:09:28.006 --> 01:09:30.503
TRAVIS: Oh shit.
MARISHA: Hey look, paper-- oh.

2007
01:09:30.503 --> 01:09:32.949
TRAVIS: Is there anything up in the chains above us?

2008
01:09:32.949 --> 01:09:34.918
Can I hold the glowing sword--

2009
01:09:34.918 --> 01:09:36.277
MATT: Yeah, make a perception check.
TALIESIN: How many people are

2010
01:09:36.277 --> 01:09:38.188
messed up right now, out of curiosity?

2011
01:09:38.188 --> 01:09:39.661
One.

2012
01:09:39.661 --> 01:09:41.820
LAURA: Should we rest?

2013
01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:43.757
Short rest?
TALIESIN: Two, three.

2014
01:09:43.757 --> 01:09:45.324
MARISHA: I wouldn't object.

2015
01:09:45.324 --> 01:09:48.479
TRAVIS: 20 for perception in the chains.

2016
01:09:48.479 --> 01:09:49.601
MATT: Nice.

2017
01:09:49.601 --> 01:09:52.081
Looking up in the chains, you don't see anything else

2018
01:09:52.081 --> 01:09:55.219
other than these, there are racks

2019
01:09:55.219 --> 01:09:57.854
where some of the chains can be shifted amongst them

2020
01:09:57.854 --> 01:10:00.681
are probably used to rotate and/or change the location

2021
01:10:00.681 --> 01:10:03.115
of the various tubes that were once there.

2022
01:10:03.115 --> 01:10:03.956
You can see on top of the tubes,

2023
01:10:03.956 --> 01:10:06.018
there are hooks that are arranged

2024
01:10:06.018 --> 01:10:07.856
to help maneuver them around.

2025
01:10:07.856 --> 01:10:09.301
You don't see anything else up there,

2026
01:10:09.301 --> 01:10:12.406
other than like a little

2027
01:10:12.406 --> 01:10:13.765
awkward slime.

2028
01:10:13.765 --> 01:10:15.123
I wouldn't say a cocoon, but looks like a space

2029
01:10:15.123 --> 01:10:20.123
where this creature spent a lot of its time.

2030
01:10:20.694 --> 01:10:22.206
God knows what madness took it,

2031
01:10:22.206 --> 01:10:26.169
not able to escape this chamber, and not being able to die.

2032
01:10:26.169 --> 01:10:28.160
TRAVIS: Yeah.
TALIESIN: He made a home here.

2033
01:10:30.166 --> 01:10:32.167
SAM: Can I break all the canisters?

2034
01:10:32.167 --> 01:10:34.000
MATT: You-- (slamming)
TALIESIN: Whoa, oh boy.

2035
01:10:35.722 --> 01:10:38.551
MATT: You shatter all the canisters. You can see,

2036
01:10:38.551 --> 01:10:42.997
they're all variations of a Halas cloned body.

2037
01:10:42.997 --> 01:10:45.737
A number of them that are cracked or left open and exposed

2038
01:10:45.737 --> 01:10:49.224
have been left to decay and are mostly just, you know,

2039
01:10:49.224 --> 01:10:53.811
sloughing skin and bone with bits of fungus

2040
01:10:53.811 --> 01:10:56.038
that have grown on a humid interior of this chamber,

2041
01:10:56.038 --> 01:10:58.479
whatever spores were available to create the spaces,

2042
01:10:58.479 --> 01:11:00.435
but they didn't expand much.

2043
01:11:00.435 --> 01:11:03.437
Other ones appear to be ones that were still held in fluid

2044
01:11:03.437 --> 01:11:05.083
that you've now left onto the ground as they fall,

2045
01:11:05.083 --> 01:11:07.752
they are also deceased, their body horribly mutated

2046
01:11:07.752 --> 01:11:09.940
with like a large jaw across the center of its torso

2047
01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:11.899
with like a big thick tongue hanging out.

2048
01:11:12.883 --> 01:11:15.243
A lot of them you can see teeth just growing

2049
01:11:15.243 --> 01:11:17.802
out of parts of the body, like there's just--

2050
01:11:17.802 --> 01:11:20.045
each one has some sort of weird, cancerous mutation

2051
01:11:20.045 --> 01:11:22.344
to its form.

2052
01:11:22.344 --> 01:11:25.038
SAM: And they look Laughing Hand-ish?

2053
01:11:25.038 --> 01:11:27.174
MATT: They all look like-- I mean, there are elements

2054
01:11:27.174 --> 01:11:28.893
of, like, the teeth everywhere that remind you

2055
01:11:28.893 --> 01:11:30.472
of that a little bit.

2056
01:11:30.472 --> 01:11:35.294
TRAVIS: This place is terrible, but horribly exciting.

2057
01:11:35.294 --> 01:11:36.855
Is everyone all right, is anyone hurt still?

2058
01:11:36.855 --> 01:11:40.518
TALIESIN: I mean, I could use a second.
LAURA: We should probably rest.

2059
01:11:40.518 --> 01:11:41.526
TRAVIS: Jester, are you hurt?

2060
01:11:41.526 --> 01:11:43.812
LAURA: No, but I feel bad for Caduceus.

2061
01:11:43.812 --> 01:11:45.697
TALIESIN: I'm a little rough.

2062
01:11:45.697 --> 01:11:47.120
Anybody else a little rough?

2063
01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:50.945
TRAVIS: I place a hand on Caduceus and I give him

2064
01:11:50.945 --> 01:11:52.061
one hit point.

2065
01:11:52.061 --> 01:11:53.728
(laughter)

2066
01:11:53.728 --> 01:11:55.780
Lay on Hands. First time, bitches.

2067
01:11:55.780 --> 01:11:57.759
MATT: There you go. (laughter)

2068
01:11:57.759 --> 01:11:59.244
TALIESIN: You give me one hit point?

2069
01:11:59.244 --> 01:12:00.942
LIAM: Use that for EMT action.

2070
01:12:00.942 --> 01:12:03.495
LAURA: Oh, he's all good now. I guess we were fine.

2071
01:12:03.495 --> 01:12:05.337
TALIESIN: I think I feel a little better.

2072
01:12:05.337 --> 01:12:07.709
That was nice, but like--
TRAVIS: Thank you.

2073
01:12:07.709 --> 01:12:10.159
TALIESIN: I'm still down.
TRAVIS: Jester, do you need...

2074
01:12:10.159 --> 01:12:11.150
healing?

2075
01:12:11.150 --> 01:12:12.792
LAURA: Can you do it any more?

2076
01:12:12.792 --> 01:12:13.625
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2077
01:12:13.625 --> 01:12:15.376
LAURA: Sure, heal me.

2078
01:12:16.376 --> 01:12:17.366
TRAVIS: Are you hurt?

2079
01:12:17.366 --> 01:12:19.284
LAURA: Yeah, I mean, I'm a little bit.

2080
01:12:19.284 --> 01:12:22.663
TALIESIN: Wait, how many times can you do that?

2081
01:12:22.663 --> 01:12:25.661
Well, I mean, that's a good way-- I would keep that,

2082
01:12:25.661 --> 01:12:30.089
just because if someone, you know, passes out or something,

2083
01:12:30.089 --> 01:12:32.582
you can just pop them back up in an emergency.

2084
01:12:32.582 --> 01:12:34.366
TRAVIS: That's a very good point, yeah, all right.

2085
01:12:34.366 --> 01:12:39.114
TALIESIN: Once we're both inevitably
unconscious in front of you.

2086
01:12:39.114 --> 01:12:41.964
LIAM: My golem is looking pretty rough.

2087
01:12:41.964 --> 01:12:45.607
I don't know how to repair him, do I?

2088
01:12:45.607 --> 01:12:47.720
There is no repairing him, probably.

2089
01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:49.397
MATT: You could attempt to spend more time

2090
01:12:49.397 --> 01:12:51.590
back in the previous chambers to try and repair him.

2091
01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:52.871
LIAM: But other than that, no idea.

2092
01:12:52.871 --> 01:12:54.212
MATT: Other than that. This is the first time

2093
01:12:54.212 --> 01:12:56.115
you've had a golem, and you've not studied much

2094
01:12:56.115 --> 01:12:58.814
in the way of repairing them. (chuckles)

2095
01:12:58.814 --> 01:13:00.143
You only just learned how to make one.

2096
01:13:00.143 --> 01:13:03.036
LAURA: I could try to mend him.

2097
01:13:03.036 --> 01:13:05.388
I'm going to use my cantrip and try to mend the golem

2098
01:13:05.388 --> 01:13:07.432
in little tiny sections.

2099
01:13:07.432 --> 01:13:11.328
Try to get his armor back together a little bit.

2100
01:13:11.328 --> 01:13:14.089
MATT: On a superficial level, you do seem to mend

2101
01:13:14.089 --> 01:13:16.746
some of the elements of the damage how it appears,

2102
01:13:16.746 --> 01:13:19.453
but because of the nature of being an actual construct,

2103
01:13:19.453 --> 01:13:21.162
it is still a creature, and not technically

2104
01:13:21.162 --> 01:13:23.780
just an inanimate object, the Mend spell

2105
01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:25.946
does not work on it.
LIAM: Paint caulking.

2106
01:13:25.946 --> 01:13:28.108
LAURA: Well, he looks prettier.

2107
01:13:28.108 --> 01:13:29.217
Yeah.
TALIESIN: Paste.

2108
01:13:29.217 --> 01:13:31.010
SAM: I'm going to do an investigation check,

2109
01:13:31.010 --> 01:13:34.536
looking specifically for bananas.

2110
01:13:34.536 --> 01:13:36.104
MATT: Okay.
(laughter)

2111
01:13:36.104 --> 01:13:37.595
LAURA: Stupid.

2112
01:13:38.587 --> 01:13:41.394
TRAVIS: Oh, you're still a big-ass gorilla.

2113
01:13:41.394 --> 01:13:43.515
SAM: I think, let's see what is at.

2114
01:13:43.515 --> 01:13:45.022
Intelligence?
MATT: Yeah.

2115
01:13:45.022 --> 01:13:46.462
SAM: Okay, 12.

2116
01:13:46.462 --> 01:13:47.592
MATT: 12.

2117
01:13:47.592 --> 01:13:49.801
(grunting)

2118
01:13:49.801 --> 01:13:52.277
Wandering through, wading through the garbage,

2119
01:13:52.277 --> 01:13:54.677
the glass shards getting stuck in knuckles

2120
01:13:54.677 --> 01:13:56.510
and angrily sticking out.

2121
01:13:56.510 --> 01:13:57.914
No bananas.

2122
01:13:57.914 --> 01:13:59.545
This is frustrating as shit.

2123
01:13:59.545 --> 01:14:01.205
TALIESIN: They have no bananas.

2124
01:14:01.205 --> 01:14:02.514
SAM: (grunting)

2125
01:14:02.514 --> 01:14:04.035
TRAVIS: Nott, is that you?

2126
01:14:04.035 --> 01:14:07.149
Nott, it is your friend, Fjord.

2127
01:14:07.149 --> 01:14:11.565
TRAVIS and SAM: (grunting)

2128
01:14:11.565 --> 01:14:13.040
SAM: Andy Serkis better be watching this.

2129
01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:14.256
(grunting)

2130
01:14:14.256 --> 01:14:19.156
(laughter)

2131
01:14:19.156 --> 01:14:24.111
(grunting)

2132
01:14:24.111 --> 01:14:26.278
LIAM: Matt, I can't remember, the other bodies

2133
01:14:26.278 --> 01:14:28.524
that just got splattered all over the floor,

2134
01:14:28.524 --> 01:14:30.267
are they shades of Halas?

2135
01:14:30.267 --> 01:14:32.713
MATT: Yeah, they're all different variations

2136
01:14:32.713 --> 01:14:35.889
of the man you saw in the portrait in that study

2137
01:14:35.889 --> 01:14:37.693
when you first came in.
TALIESIN: Like action figures.

2138
01:14:37.693 --> 01:14:41.235
TRAVIS: Can I investigate that far door, just for imagery,

2139
01:14:41.235 --> 01:14:43.175
cover, the silver one.

2140
01:14:43.175 --> 01:14:44.641
MATT: There are two doors.

2141
01:14:44.641 --> 01:14:45.954
TRAVIS: Yeah, this one at the far end.

2142
01:14:45.954 --> 01:14:47.878
I don't want to open it, just to see what it looks like.

2143
01:14:47.878 --> 01:14:50.009
MATT: Okay, you approach and you see a dark wooden door,

2144
01:14:50.009 --> 01:14:53.270
a basic metal, slightly polished iron frame.

2145
01:14:53.270 --> 01:14:55.790
In the center of the door, there is a purple gem

2146
01:14:55.790 --> 01:14:57.012
that is embedded in it.

2147
01:14:57.012 --> 01:14:58.957
Maybe about like an inch across.

2148
01:14:58.957 --> 01:15:02.983
TRAVIS: Any sort of defining features of the gem,

2149
01:15:02.983 --> 01:15:04.667
or just a rough gem, inlaid?

2150
01:15:04.667 --> 01:15:06.448
MATT: It's a cut gem.

2151
01:15:06.448 --> 01:15:08.001
It's not raw.
TRAVIS: No symbols?

2152
01:15:08.001 --> 01:15:09.739
MATT: No symbols, nothing like that.

2153
01:15:09.739 --> 01:15:11.060
TRAVIS: There's a purple gem in this door.

2154
01:15:11.060 --> 01:15:15.288
I know according to the map, one way leads one step closer

2155
01:15:15.288 --> 01:15:18.930
to the heart, and the other leads to something probably bad.

2156
01:15:18.930 --> 01:15:21.273
LAURA: Well, what does the other door look like?

2157
01:15:21.273 --> 01:15:22.806
LIAM: Caleb will go inspect this chamber,

2158
01:15:22.806 --> 01:15:24.053
try to understand the nature of it.

2159
01:15:24.053 --> 01:15:27.809
MATT: The other one you see is a plain brass door.

2160
01:15:27.809 --> 01:15:29.900
It's just a solid brass door, it is featureless,

2161
01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:34.900
it has, as opposed to a knob, it just has a handle.

2162
01:15:34.921 --> 01:15:36.620
TRAVIS: (sighs)

2163
01:15:36.620 --> 01:15:37.764
Boy.

2164
01:15:37.764 --> 01:15:39.551
MARISHA: Feels like a toss-up, right?

2165
01:15:39.551 --> 01:15:44.373
TALIESIN: I mean, if we we're looking at the map.

2166
01:15:44.373 --> 01:15:47.330
TRAVIS: Is there anything on the desk that would indicate--

2167
01:15:47.330 --> 01:15:50.289
LAURA: What about that chest over in the corner there?

2168
01:15:50.289 --> 01:15:53.031
Anything in that chest?

2169
01:15:53.031 --> 01:15:54.571
That one, yeah.
MATT: Right there?

2170
01:15:54.571 --> 01:15:56.904
Make an investigation check.

2171
01:16:00.751 --> 01:16:03.621
MARISHA: While we do this, can I take a short rest?

2172
01:16:03.621 --> 01:16:04.907
MATT: If you want to take an hour for a short rest?

2173
01:16:04.907 --> 01:16:06.127
LAURA: I feel like we should.

2174
01:16:06.127 --> 01:16:07.124
MARISHA: I'm pretty fucked up.

2175
01:16:07.124 --> 01:16:08.341
LAURA: Yeah, so is Caduceus.

2176
01:16:08.341 --> 01:16:09.538
MATT: Okay, you take a short rest.

2177
01:16:09.538 --> 01:16:11.710
TALIESIN: Once you turn back, you're going to be
pretty messed up, too.

2178
01:16:11.710 --> 01:16:13.722
MATT: Which, that last for an hour.

2179
01:16:13.722 --> 01:16:15.955
LIAM: Yeah, I do, go ahead.

2180
01:16:15.955 --> 01:16:17.156
MATT: Right.

2181
01:16:17.156 --> 01:16:18.576
So I'm saying, taking a short rest,

2182
01:16:18.576 --> 01:16:20.598
that would vanish by the end of your short rest.

2183
01:16:20.598 --> 01:16:22.452
SAM: I'm sorry, say that again?

2184
01:16:22.452 --> 01:16:24.325
MATT: Your Polymorph would vanish before the end

2185
01:16:24.325 --> 01:16:26.167
of the short rest.
SAM: Sure.

2186
01:16:26.167 --> 01:16:27.243
MATT: If you were to keep it the whole time.

2187
01:16:27.243 --> 01:16:29.888
LIAM: Caleb is inspecting the gem on that door,

2188
01:16:29.888 --> 01:16:31.319
to understand the nature of it.

2189
01:16:31.319 --> 01:16:34.816
MATT: Okay, make an arcana check.

2190
01:16:34.816 --> 01:16:36.668
As far as checking the chest, Jester,

2191
01:16:36.668 --> 01:16:39.497
looking inside, there isn't a whole lot in it,

2192
01:16:39.497 --> 01:16:41.820
it's only maybe a third full, and in there are these

2193
01:16:41.820 --> 01:16:44.139
large glass jars of a similar color of liquid

2194
01:16:44.139 --> 01:16:47.412
as what was inside these large containers,

2195
01:16:47.412 --> 01:16:49.456
as well as a few tools that were used to

2196
01:16:49.456 --> 01:16:53.340
gather and unhook hooks, as well as a few other things

2197
01:16:53.340 --> 01:16:54.923
that look like implements that were used

2198
01:16:54.923 --> 01:16:57.583
in manipulation or dissection.

2199
01:16:57.583 --> 01:17:00.144
LAURA: I'll take the liquid.

2200
01:17:00.144 --> 01:17:01.530
You said it was a large jar?

2201
01:17:01.530 --> 01:17:03.033
MATT: There's three of these large jars about that big

2202
01:17:03.033 --> 01:17:04.414
with the liquid inside of it, yeah.

2203
01:17:04.414 --> 01:17:06.412
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to take them.

2204
01:17:06.412 --> 01:17:08.969
MATT: Okay, and fit them all into the haversack?

2205
01:17:08.969 --> 01:17:10.092
LAURA: Will they fit?

2206
01:17:10.092 --> 01:17:11.634
MATT: You're starting to get pretty--

2207
01:17:11.634 --> 01:17:12.868
LAURA: Pretty jammed in?
MATT: Pretty jammed in there.

2208
01:17:12.868 --> 01:17:15.113
Just as long as you keep track of your space in there.

2209
01:17:15.113 --> 01:17:18.940
LAURA: I'm going to try to stick the heart cluster

2210
01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:21.484
in one of the jars, if it fits.

2211
01:17:21.484 --> 01:17:22.863
MATT: Okay.

2212
01:17:22.863 --> 01:17:25.682
You remove the horrible mutated heart cluster

2213
01:17:25.682 --> 01:17:27.429
and set it inside the jar and close it.

2214
01:17:27.429 --> 01:17:30.631
It slips in, like a lot of liquid spills out

2215
01:17:30.631 --> 01:17:31.949
just from displacement as you push it in there.

2216
01:17:31.949 --> 01:17:34.136
It takes up most of the jar size.

2217
01:17:34.136 --> 01:17:36.681
Because the jar's about this tall and about this big around,

2218
01:17:36.681 --> 01:17:37.679
and that heart cluster takes up

2219
01:17:37.679 --> 01:17:39.290
that entire space on the inside.

2220
01:17:39.290 --> 01:17:41.790
LAURA: Look at this nastiness!

2221
01:17:43.435 --> 01:17:45.152
Would this fit in the bigger bag?

2222
01:17:45.152 --> 01:17:46.886
MATT: Yeah, the jar size actually, technically at
that width,

2223
01:17:46.886 --> 01:17:48.134
would not fit into the haversack's pouches.

2224
01:17:48.134 --> 01:17:49.250
It would have to go in the bag of holding.

2225
01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:51.720
TRAVIS: Yeah, I can put it in the-- oh, it's on the edges,

2226
01:17:51.720 --> 01:17:53.272
you didn't even wipe it down.

2227
01:17:53.272 --> 01:17:57.345
LAURA: What was I going to wipe it off with?

2228
01:17:57.345 --> 01:17:59.836
SAM: Did you have acid somewhere, Beau?

2229
01:17:59.836 --> 01:18:01.177
TALIESIN: Oh, and also, I would have done

2230
01:18:01.177 --> 01:18:03.828
a quick Detect Magic as well,

2231
01:18:03.828 --> 01:18:05.654
just to see if there's anything in this room that's pinging.

2232
01:18:05.654 --> 01:18:07.513
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: (horrified yelling)

2233
01:18:07.513 --> 01:18:10.940
MATT: You focus your surroundings.

2234
01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:14.043
Nothing specifically magical catches your attention

2235
01:18:14.043 --> 01:18:17.262
in the surroundings beyond the doors.

2236
01:18:17.262 --> 01:18:18.896
LIAM: 27 on the door, by the way.

2237
01:18:18.896 --> 01:18:20.291
MATT: 27 on the door?

2238
01:18:20.291 --> 01:18:25.205
The gem, looking at it, the gem itself is not magical,

2239
01:18:25.205 --> 01:18:27.686
there's no magical essence to it.

2240
01:18:27.686 --> 01:18:31.486
But you can see around the base of the gem,

2241
01:18:31.486 --> 01:18:36.486
there's very, very faint runes that just say "The Sea"

2242
01:18:36.597 --> 01:18:40.608
in older Draconic.

2243
01:18:40.608 --> 01:18:41.441
TRAVIS: Whoa.

2244
01:18:41.441 --> 01:18:42.908
LAURA: The sea.
LIAM: That's the Dreadnought.

2245
01:18:42.908 --> 01:18:44.062
MARISHA: Yeah.

2246
01:18:44.062 --> 01:18:46.173
TRAVIS: What'd you say?
LIAM: That is the Dreadnought.

2247
01:18:46.173 --> 01:18:47.673
LAURA: How do you know?

2248
01:18:48.695 --> 01:18:49.945
LIAM: I read a lot.

2249
01:18:51.636 --> 01:18:54.082
TRAVIS: We don't want to go there, right?

2250
01:18:54.082 --> 01:18:55.563
At least not yet.

2251
01:18:55.563 --> 01:18:56.396
TALIESIN: Not now.

2252
01:18:57.234 --> 01:18:59.250
TRAVIS: All right, brass door.

2253
01:18:59.250 --> 01:19:01.616
Should we-- I mean, look.

2254
01:19:01.616 --> 01:19:03.891
This place is a fucking madhouse.

2255
01:19:03.891 --> 01:19:05.615
Should we tie a restraint around someone

2256
01:19:05.615 --> 01:19:08.680
before whoever wants to open the brass door does?

2257
01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:11.222
Just in case it, you know--
LAURA: Does it work like that?

2258
01:19:11.222 --> 01:19:13.343
TRAVIS: I don't know, I'm just trying to think ahead.

2259
01:19:13.343 --> 01:19:14.714
LAURA: We could try it.

2260
01:19:14.714 --> 01:19:17.757
TALIESIN: It'll probably just drag anybody

2261
01:19:17.757 --> 01:19:19.550
who's tied to it together.

2262
01:19:19.550 --> 01:19:20.522
TRAVIS: That's a fair point.

2263
01:19:20.522 --> 01:19:22.592
LAURA: We could try it, though.

2264
01:19:22.592 --> 01:19:25.488
SAM: I'm going to check out this acid, to see if
I can discern

2265
01:19:25.488 --> 01:19:28.913
its nature, or how potent it is.

2266
01:19:28.913 --> 01:19:30.602
MATT: Sure.
SAM: Is it just basic acid?

2267
01:19:30.602 --> 01:19:32.722
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

2268
01:19:32.722 --> 01:19:34.978
LIAM: Is this before the rest or after?

2269
01:19:34.978 --> 01:19:35.811
SAM: 12.

2270
01:19:35.811 --> 01:19:37.241
TALIESIN: Have you burned through all of your heals?

2271
01:19:37.241 --> 01:19:38.936
MATT: It's fairly potent.

2272
01:19:38.936 --> 01:19:40.876
SAM: Rest long enough that it would wear off

2273
01:19:40.876 --> 01:19:42.754
or you would dispel it at some point.

2274
01:19:42.754 --> 01:19:44.090
LIAM: Right, just didn't know if we're doing all
this business,

2275
01:19:44.090 --> 01:19:45.510
because you can't do anything when you're resting,

2276
01:19:45.510 --> 01:19:48.501
so I was wondering if we're doing our business then resting.

2277
01:19:48.501 --> 01:19:50.824
LAURA: I'm definitely doing my business in here,

2278
01:19:50.824 --> 01:19:52.464
because it's been a while.

2279
01:19:52.464 --> 01:19:54.334
(laughter)

2280
01:19:54.334 --> 01:19:55.542
TALIESIN: Especially by outside time.

2281
01:19:55.542 --> 01:19:57.088
That's like a long time.

2282
01:19:57.088 --> 01:20:00.006
MATT: After reverting to your normal form,

2283
01:20:00.006 --> 01:20:01.590
you go ahead and check the acid.

2284
01:20:01.590 --> 01:20:03.520
It is very potent, it is as potent, if not a little more

2285
01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:05.561
than the stuff that you're used to using,

2286
01:20:05.561 --> 01:20:07.940
with any of your acid vials previously.

2287
01:20:07.940 --> 01:20:09.514
It would do the same as an acid vial.

2288
01:20:09.514 --> 01:20:12.626
But this particular jar could fill 20 acid vials.

2289
01:20:12.626 --> 01:20:13.479
LAURA: Whoa!

2290
01:20:13.479 --> 01:20:15.484
TRAVIS: You know what we haven't done in this room

2291
01:20:15.484 --> 01:20:17.631
is look for hidden floor compartments

2292
01:20:17.631 --> 01:20:18.880
or hidden doors in the wall.

2293
01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:20.719
LAURA: We should, we should look for hidden doorways

2294
01:20:20.719 --> 01:20:22.317
to see if they lead anywhere else.

2295
01:20:22.317 --> 01:20:24.785
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.
SAM: Okay.

2296
01:20:24.785 --> 01:20:26.160
LAURA: Yeah, let's check around the room.

2297
01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:28.065
TRAVIS: Can we fan out and search areas of the wall

2298
01:20:28.065 --> 01:20:29.205
and pull at bricks and--

2299
01:20:29.205 --> 01:20:31.319
MATT: Okay, so who's helming the search and who's helping?

2300
01:20:31.319 --> 01:20:32.208
SAM: I'll try.

2301
01:20:32.208 --> 01:20:33.932
LAURA: And Beau. Nott and Beau.

2302
01:20:33.932 --> 01:20:35.032
MARISHA: Okay, yeah.

2303
01:20:35.032 --> 01:20:36.331
MATT: Who's helming? Or are you guys rolling separately?

2304
01:20:36.331 --> 01:20:38.428
Go for it. Both of you guys roll for investigation checks.

2305
01:20:38.428 --> 01:20:39.619
MARISHA: We should do that, right?

2306
01:20:39.619 --> 01:20:41.074
LAURA: Oh, but have some Guidance.

2307
01:20:41.966 --> 01:20:43.115
TRAVIS: Fucking get it.

2308
01:20:43.115 --> 01:20:44.207
MARISHA: Natural 20!

2309
01:20:44.207 --> 01:20:46.572
MATT: Damn, this has been a session, man.

2310
01:20:46.572 --> 01:20:47.810
TALIESIN: Where has this been?

2311
01:20:47.810 --> 01:20:48.941
TRAVIS: Let's go.

2312
01:20:48.941 --> 01:20:50.869
MARISHA: They've been on this little blue die, too.

2313
01:20:50.869 --> 01:20:53.107
My little Cobalt buddy.
SAM: I got a 26 or 28,

2314
01:20:53.107 --> 01:20:54.701
if you allow her a late Guidance.

2315
01:20:54.701 --> 01:20:55.744
TRAVIS: Wow.

2316
01:20:55.744 --> 01:20:58.468
MATT: You guys take about 15 or so minutes

2317
01:20:58.468 --> 01:21:00.517
scanning the entirety of the chamber,

2318
01:21:00.517 --> 01:21:01.725
looking up against the ceiling,

2319
01:21:01.725 --> 01:21:03.705
looking around the nearby walls.

2320
01:21:03.705 --> 01:21:05.660
You feel pretty certain by the end of your search

2321
01:21:05.660 --> 01:21:08.261
there are no other exits.

2322
01:21:08.261 --> 01:21:10.378
At the very least, you've eliminated that possibility.

2323
01:21:10.378 --> 01:21:11.211
SAM and LAURA: Okay.

2324
01:21:11.211 --> 01:21:12.071
MATT: The mystery is not there.

2325
01:21:12.071 --> 01:21:12.960
MARISHA: Oh, not good.

2326
01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:13.992
TALIESIN: If you had just rolled one higher.

2327
01:21:13.992 --> 01:21:15.142
MATT: Not in this chamber.

2328
01:21:15.142 --> 01:21:15.975
LAURA: Okay.

2329
01:21:15.975 --> 01:21:17.291
But other chambers.

2330
01:21:17.291 --> 01:21:19.745
But other chambers, that would've really helped us.

2331
01:21:19.745 --> 01:21:22.202
MARISHA: It would've really helped us, yeah, yeah.

2332
01:21:22.202 --> 01:21:23.410
LAURA: Okay.

2333
01:21:23.410 --> 01:21:26.301
I tied the rope around my waist, if you want to,

2334
01:21:26.301 --> 01:21:27.796
I can go through.

2335
01:21:27.796 --> 01:21:28.861
TRAVIS: I'll be right behind you.

2336
01:21:28.861 --> 01:21:30.740
Try it, open the door.

2337
01:21:30.740 --> 01:21:32.979
MATT: Which one?
LAURA: The brass door.

2338
01:21:32.979 --> 01:21:33.813
MATT: Okay.

2339
01:21:33.813 --> 01:21:36.175
TALIESIN: Is this the one to the--
LAURA: The study.

2340
01:21:36.175 --> 01:21:37.008
TALIESIN: Oh, the study.

2341
01:21:37.008 --> 01:21:38.673
LAURA: Oh, it's locked.
MATT: It's locked.

2342
01:21:38.673 --> 01:21:41.340
LAURA: Hey, Nott, this door's actually locked.

2343
01:21:41.340 --> 01:21:42.945
SAM: Oh, yes.
TRAVIS: Is there a keyhole?

2344
01:21:42.945 --> 01:21:44.862
MATT: There no keyhole.

2345
01:21:45.773 --> 01:21:48.395
LIAM: Caduceus was sniffing that door before,

2346
01:21:48.395 --> 01:21:51.148
it's magically locked?

2347
01:21:51.148 --> 01:21:53.846
MATT: The door has a magical aura to it and it is
not opening.

2348
01:21:53.846 --> 01:21:56.029
TRAVIS: You were pulling. Try pushing.

2349
01:21:56.029 --> 01:21:58.612
LIAM: Caleb walks over to it and touches his hand to it,

2350
01:21:58.612 --> 01:22:02.010
and there is a very loud knocking sound.

2351
01:22:02.010 --> 01:22:04.031
MATT: (impacts, creaking)

2352
01:22:04.031 --> 01:22:04.864
Door opens.

2353
01:22:04.864 --> 01:22:05.948
TRAVIS: Wow!
LAURA: Whoa!

2354
01:22:05.948 --> 01:22:08.670
TRAVIS: That's fucking handy as shit.

2355
01:22:08.670 --> 01:22:10.350
TALIESIN: That was crazy.

2356
01:22:10.350 --> 01:22:12.329
LIAM: You just had to Knock.

2357
01:22:12.329 --> 01:22:13.290
TALIESIN: That's fair.

2358
01:22:13.290 --> 01:22:15.110
MATT: You pull the door open.

2359
01:22:15.110 --> 01:22:16.997
You can see a staircase that descends

2360
01:22:16.997 --> 01:22:20.915
slightly downward into shadow.

2361
01:22:20.915 --> 01:22:22.166
LAURA: Staircase.

2362
01:22:22.166 --> 01:22:23.701
It's descending.

2363
01:22:23.701 --> 01:22:24.810
Should we go?

2364
01:22:24.810 --> 01:22:29.060
TRAVIS: I mean, I think we know where the Dreadnought is.

2365
01:22:30.398 --> 01:22:32.297
LIAM: Could send down Frumpkin.

2366
01:22:32.297 --> 01:22:33.130
TRAVIS: We could.

2367
01:22:33.130 --> 01:22:34.784
LAURA: Yeah, let's do that, let's just in case,

2368
01:22:34.784 --> 01:22:35.955
what if it's the Dreadnought waiting

2369
01:22:35.955 --> 01:22:38.871
at the bottom of the stairs?

2370
01:22:38.871 --> 01:22:41.027
LIAM: Okay, so send Frumpkin down.

2371
01:22:41.027 --> 01:22:41.860
MATT: Okay.

2372
01:22:41.860 --> 01:22:43.359
Frumpkin passes through the doorway.

2373
01:22:43.359 --> 01:22:45.141
The minute that Frumpkin steps on the stairs,

2374
01:22:45.141 --> 01:22:47.873
and you see the stairs slightly begin to curve

2375
01:22:47.873 --> 01:22:49.780
at like a slight corkscrew angle before they

2376
01:22:49.780 --> 01:22:52.885
vanish into darkness, and then a moment later,

2377
01:22:52.885 --> 01:22:54.960
you lose your connection with Frumpkin.

2378
01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:56.974
LIAM: Oh, that's not just a stairwell.

2379
01:22:56.974 --> 01:22:58.556
LAURA: It's a doorway.

2380
01:22:58.556 --> 01:23:00.588
SAM: It's one of these things that we've been
through before.

2381
01:23:00.588 --> 01:23:03.380
LIAM: Yeah, that is squishy in there. It's wobbly inside.

2382
01:23:03.380 --> 01:23:04.213
TRAVIS: Should we all do it together?

2383
01:23:04.213 --> 01:23:07.712
LAURA: I step forward.
TRAVIS: I run after her.

2384
01:23:07.712 --> 01:23:10.294
MATT: Both Jester and Fjord vanish into the open--

2385
01:23:10.294 --> 01:23:12.738
TALIESIN: I count to five and then we go.

2386
01:23:12.738 --> 01:23:15.305
They seem cool with whatever's over there.

2387
01:23:15.305 --> 01:23:17.972
MARISHA: Three, I'm going, I go.

2388
01:23:18.911 --> 01:23:20.402
MATT: Everybody else go through?
SAM: Yes.

2389
01:23:20.402 --> 01:23:21.953
MATT: One by one, you all step through.

2390
01:23:21.953 --> 01:23:23.251
LIAM: Caleb hangs back for a second

2391
01:23:23.251 --> 01:23:25.556
and stares at one of the mangled corpses.

2392
01:23:25.556 --> 01:23:27.733
The one with the most complete face of Halas

2393
01:23:27.733 --> 01:23:30.477
that he can find and just stares at it for 10 seconds.

2394
01:23:30.477 --> 01:23:31.728
MATT: Okay.

2395
01:23:31.728 --> 01:23:33.236
LAURA: 10 seconds? That's a long time.

2396
01:23:33.236 --> 01:23:35.530
LIAM: And then he goes.
LAURA: A round of combat.

2397
01:23:35.530 --> 01:23:36.730
MATT: He heads in.

2398
01:23:36.730 --> 01:23:40.216
The stairway rotates and you start finding yourself

2399
01:23:40.216 --> 01:23:42.282
instinctually having to readjust

2400
01:23:42.282 --> 01:23:44.676
because you're waiting for the gravity to slide off,

2401
01:23:44.676 --> 01:23:46.321
but it doesn't. It's this odd sensation

2402
01:23:46.321 --> 01:23:48.255
where you have to trust the spiral,

2403
01:23:48.255 --> 01:23:51.968
and you feel yourself drawn downward towards it

2404
01:23:51.968 --> 01:23:53.788
as if it was a natural staircase.

2405
01:23:53.788 --> 01:23:57.741
Seems to spiral three, four, almost 10 times

2406
01:23:57.741 --> 01:24:00.807
before you hit something dark.

2407
01:24:00.807 --> 01:24:02.244
There's no light in here, there's just now

2408
01:24:02.244 --> 01:24:06.568
a hard edge of some sort of door right in front of you.

2409
01:24:06.568 --> 01:24:09.834
It would be Jester, you'd be the first one.

2410
01:24:09.834 --> 01:24:11.606
No, because Fjord came first.
LAURA: Fjord came right after.

2411
01:24:11.606 --> 01:24:12.967
MATT: So Jester, you're the first one to get to it,

2412
01:24:12.967 --> 01:24:15.125
and you feel down and you feel another handle.

2413
01:24:15.125 --> 01:24:16.954
LAURA: There's a door.

2414
01:24:16.954 --> 01:24:18.026
Should I open it?

2415
01:24:18.026 --> 01:24:20.184
MATT: But even with darkvision, you cannot see anything.

2416
01:24:20.184 --> 01:24:21.867
You can just feel something there.

2417
01:24:21.867 --> 01:24:23.411
It is magical darkness.

2418
01:24:23.411 --> 01:24:26.749
TRAVIS: Yeah, so even if I tried to galas-var
with the sword--

2419
01:24:26.749 --> 01:24:28.980
LAURA: Don't do it, I'm right in front of you!

2420
01:24:28.980 --> 01:24:30.818
MATT: You try, "Galas-var."

2421
01:24:30.818 --> 01:24:34.733
You feel it invoke, but there's no light.

2422
01:24:34.733 --> 01:24:37.177
This is a zone of magical darkness.

2423
01:24:37.177 --> 01:24:39.441
TRAVIS: Well, we've got nothing. Go for it, Jester.

2424
01:24:39.441 --> 01:24:42.199
LAURA: It's pretty dark in here, and we're just
here alone...

2425
01:24:42.199 --> 01:24:43.032
Okay.

2426
01:24:43.032 --> 01:24:45.103
(laughter)

2427
01:24:45.103 --> 01:24:47.097
MATT: What was that move?

2428
01:24:47.097 --> 01:24:48.993
LAURA: I try to open it.

2429
01:24:48.993 --> 01:24:51.724
(laughter)

2430
01:24:51.724 --> 01:24:54.092
MARISHA: Oh, Fjord, fuck, oh.

2431
01:24:54.092 --> 01:24:56.076
MATT: You push the doorway open.

2432
01:24:56.076 --> 01:24:56.909
LAURA: Oh no.

2433
01:24:57.946 --> 01:25:00.450
MATT: Stepping into these chambers, you find

2434
01:25:00.450 --> 01:25:04.162
a somewhat cramped room with central hardwood floor,

2435
01:25:04.162 --> 01:25:05.840
a handful of shelves filled with jars

2436
01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:07.720
of nondescript organic matter placed against

2437
01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:11.729
the distant wall and the two edges of it,

2438
01:25:11.729 --> 01:25:14.659
and a massive central roller desk that houses all manner

2439
01:25:14.659 --> 01:25:16.771
of scattered notes, sketches, small tools

2440
01:25:16.771 --> 01:25:18.577
of curious utility.

2441
01:25:18.577 --> 01:25:20.626
There's a hanging iron chandelier in the center

2442
01:25:20.626 --> 01:25:22.108
of the chamber above you, outfitted with

2443
01:25:22.108 --> 01:25:25.677
ever-burning candles, while the bare gray walls of stone

2444
01:25:25.677 --> 01:25:28.942
loom about 20 feet high over this otherwise simple space.

2445
01:25:28.942 --> 01:25:31.438
The chamber's arranged in almost a batarang scenario.

2446
01:25:31.438 --> 01:25:34.043
You step into it, and it bends to two points

2447
01:25:34.043 --> 01:25:35.232
to the right and left side of you

2448
01:25:35.232 --> 01:25:37.515
and then comes to the center before bowing onto

2449
01:25:37.515 --> 01:25:41.907
a trapezoid-type shape.

2450
01:25:44.857 --> 01:25:45.690
SAM: Are we all in?

2451
01:25:45.690 --> 01:25:46.976
MATT: You guys all eventually saunter in

2452
01:25:46.976 --> 01:25:48.856
and see the same scenario.

2453
01:25:48.856 --> 01:25:50.527
What you see as you were approaching in the staircase,

2454
01:25:50.527 --> 01:25:52.508
the doorway open and the silhouettes of Jester and Fjord

2455
01:25:52.508 --> 01:25:54.728
pass through what was previously just endless darkness,

2456
01:25:54.728 --> 01:25:55.975
you not have something to work towards,

2457
01:25:55.975 --> 01:25:57.235
and you all enter the chamber.

2458
01:25:57.235 --> 01:25:58.504
SAM: The shelves have just jars on them,

2459
01:25:58.504 --> 01:26:00.507
or is it books and stuff, too?

2460
01:26:00.507 --> 01:26:02.535
MATT: As you all step in, there's a very faint

2461
01:26:02.535 --> 01:26:03.776
[heartbeat]

2462
01:26:05.401 --> 01:26:10.401
vibrational pattern that slowly seems to be beating--

2463
01:26:10.446 --> 01:26:12.039
TRAVIS: That's some Shining shit.

2464
01:26:12.039 --> 01:26:14.344
MATT: -- sourcelessly around you.

2465
01:26:14.344 --> 01:26:17.351
LIAM: Caleb is cautiously approaching that desk.

2466
01:26:17.351 --> 01:26:20.417
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: And wants to devour it.

2467
01:26:20.417 --> 01:26:21.656
MATT: You're going to eat the desk.

2468
01:26:21.656 --> 01:26:23.906
Okay, I know what you mean. All right.

2469
01:26:24.925 --> 01:26:27.245
LAURA: Which part did we enter on?

2470
01:26:27.245 --> 01:26:28.467
Which wall did we enter?

2471
01:26:28.467 --> 01:26:29.851
MATT: You entered on the southern wall.

2472
01:26:29.851 --> 01:26:31.496
If you're looking at the shape here,

2473
01:26:31.496 --> 01:26:32.772
you entered from the southern wall,

2474
01:26:32.772 --> 01:26:34.749
and across from you immediately is the desk

2475
01:26:34.749 --> 01:26:36.446
and the three shelves there.

2476
01:26:36.446 --> 01:26:38.845
TALIESIN: I feel like we should be really careful in here.

2477
01:26:38.845 --> 01:26:40.043
MARISHA: One desk?

2478
01:26:40.043 --> 01:26:41.169
MATT: One desk.

2479
01:26:41.169 --> 01:26:42.642
MARISHA: And three what?

2480
01:26:42.642 --> 01:26:45.142
MATT: Three shelves.

2481
01:26:45.142 --> 01:26:47.698
TRAVIS: No windows, no compartments, no--

2482
01:26:47.698 --> 01:26:49.356
MATT: Nah.
TRAVIS: Just a chandelier.

2483
01:26:49.356 --> 01:26:51.812
MARISHA: Is it, the three shelves and a desk,

2484
01:26:51.812 --> 01:26:55.448
are they arranged in a certain way?

2485
01:26:55.448 --> 01:26:57.277
MATT: I'll show you a layout.

2486
01:26:57.277 --> 01:26:58.920
ALL: Oh!

2487
01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:00.360
MATT: To help you guys a little bit.

2488
01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:01.608
Be right back.

2489
01:27:01.608 --> 01:27:02.989
TALIESIN: This is good that we healed up,

2490
01:27:02.989 --> 01:27:05.558
because "I'll show you a layout" means you can mess
up badly.

2491
01:27:05.558 --> 01:27:06.904
TRAVIS: We're not fighting anything.

2492
01:27:06.904 --> 01:27:11.056
SAM: Matt's layout is brought to you by Dwarven Forge.

2493
01:27:11.056 --> 01:27:14.271
I think I'm doing this wrong.

2494
01:27:14.271 --> 01:27:15.878
LAURA: Is there something in there?

2495
01:27:15.878 --> 01:27:16.836
What's happening?

2496
01:27:16.836 --> 01:27:17.910
SAM: My head grew.

2497
01:27:17.910 --> 01:27:19.537
TRAVIS: Push it down while you're doing it.

2498
01:27:19.537 --> 01:27:22.112
MATT: There are two candelabras--
SAM: Dwarvenforge.com.

2499
01:27:22.112 --> 01:27:25.070
MATT: -- and a red carpet in the center of the chamber.

2500
01:27:25.070 --> 01:27:28.737
That is the layout of the room you're in.

2501
01:27:30.029 --> 01:27:31.111
LIAM: Right.

2502
01:27:31.111 --> 01:27:33.324
Nott the Brave, will you join me, please?

2503
01:27:33.324 --> 01:27:34.447
SAM: At the desk?

2504
01:27:34.447 --> 01:27:36.155
Yes, I will.

2505
01:27:36.155 --> 01:27:38.232
TALIESIN: I would check for traps on everything.

2506
01:27:38.232 --> 01:27:40.453
LAURA: So many.
TALIESIN: This feels real--

2507
01:27:40.453 --> 01:27:42.559
LAURA: Are the whole floors hardwood?

2508
01:27:42.559 --> 01:27:44.968
MATT: The center has a hardwoods element there

2509
01:27:44.968 --> 01:27:47.149
and some stone on the outer edges.

2510
01:27:47.149 --> 01:27:49.161
SAM: I think me and Caleb just walked across the rug

2511
01:27:49.161 --> 01:27:51.304
to get to the desk.
MATT: You did.

2512
01:27:51.304 --> 01:27:52.570
SAM: Did we die?

2513
01:27:52.570 --> 01:27:54.271
MATT: Caleb, you walk across the center

2514
01:27:54.271 --> 01:27:58.424
of the chamber, across the red rug towards the desk there.

2515
01:27:58.424 --> 01:28:00.404
TRAVIS: You know better than this.

2516
01:28:00.404 --> 01:28:01.383
LIAM: I approach cautiously.

2517
01:28:01.383 --> 01:28:03.049
MATT: And nothing happens.
TRAVIS: Shut up!

2518
01:28:03.049 --> 01:28:04.562
MATT: You approach the desk, and you can see

2519
01:28:04.562 --> 01:28:07.163
there are papers and notes.

2520
01:28:07.163 --> 01:28:09.205
You glance down, they're all in Zemnian.

2521
01:28:09.205 --> 01:28:10.038
SAM: Ooh.

2522
01:28:11.625 --> 01:28:13.304
LIAM: I start to read quickly.

2523
01:28:13.304 --> 01:28:15.307
SAM: I'm going to join him and start looking,

2524
01:28:15.307 --> 01:28:17.690
looking at the drawer and see if any are locked.

2525
01:28:17.690 --> 01:28:21.047
MATT: Okay, make an investigation check.

2526
01:28:21.047 --> 01:28:23.447
SAM: 20, nope, 18.

2527
01:28:23.447 --> 01:28:24.970
MATT: Okay.

2528
01:28:24.970 --> 01:28:27.589
The drawers are not locked, and as you open them,

2529
01:28:27.589 --> 01:28:31.481
on the inside, you can see there's inkwells,

2530
01:28:32.919 --> 01:28:34.348
various other bits of chalk,

2531
01:28:34.348 --> 01:28:37.027
little glass beads; all sort of things

2532
01:28:37.027 --> 01:28:38.499
that are simple components,

2533
01:28:38.499 --> 01:28:41.133
like spell components and elements meant for note keeping,

2534
01:28:41.133 --> 01:28:44.893
and you would imagine this would be almost like

2535
01:28:44.893 --> 01:28:47.726
a smallerd-- not smallerd. A smaller--

2536
01:28:49.682 --> 01:28:51.936
Imagine if a powerful mage were to have

2537
01:28:51.936 --> 01:28:56.386
a temporary study, loosely outfitted.

2538
01:28:56.386 --> 01:28:59.775
LIAM: Is the Zemnian contemporary or in more archaic form?

2539
01:28:59.775 --> 01:29:02.817
MATT: A more archaic form of Zemnian.

2540
01:29:04.314 --> 01:29:05.949
It'll take it a little bit to read through

2541
01:29:05.949 --> 01:29:07.959
what you find, glancing through what looks important.

2542
01:29:07.959 --> 01:29:12.419
You do find out, one, some of the notes outline

2543
01:29:12.419 --> 01:29:15.993
the discovery of a curious simple extraplanar chamber

2544
01:29:15.993 --> 01:29:18.582
set adrift across the planes,

2545
01:29:18.582 --> 01:29:21.525
then talks about shackling it to the tower for study,

2546
01:29:21.525 --> 01:29:24.056
and goes into the process and the design of

2547
01:29:24.056 --> 01:29:28.155
what elements of the tower he had planned to manipulate

2548
01:29:28.155 --> 01:29:29.901
to shackle and bring it to the tower,

2549
01:29:29.901 --> 01:29:33.159
and a lot of that escapes your understanding.

2550
01:29:33.159 --> 01:29:35.717
Make an arcana check for me.

2551
01:29:37.421 --> 01:29:38.569
LIAM: 16.

2552
01:29:38.569 --> 01:29:42.170
MATT: Your mind cannot grasp the intricacies

2553
01:29:42.170 --> 01:29:47.170
of these various designs, but then those notes fade a bit

2554
01:29:47.207 --> 01:29:50.289
into other pages that speak of the strange horror

2555
01:29:50.289 --> 01:29:51.472
within this chamber.

2556
01:29:51.472 --> 01:29:53.005
LIAM: Horror?
MATT: Horror.

2557
01:29:53.005 --> 01:29:57.964
A swollen, beating heart without a body,

2558
01:29:57.964 --> 01:30:00.049
locked within a field of magical energy.

2559
01:30:00.049 --> 01:30:04.549
LAURA: Oh, he found it floating around

2560
01:30:04.549 --> 01:30:05.930
and then combined it onto his.

2561
01:30:05.930 --> 01:30:08.717
MATT: Halas' curiosity got the best of him,

2562
01:30:08.717 --> 01:30:11.913
and he dispelled the field, only to find the heart

2563
01:30:11.913 --> 01:30:15.132
emitting a corrosive aura as it summoned fleshy tendrils

2564
01:30:15.132 --> 01:30:17.326
to defend itself.

2565
01:30:17.326 --> 01:30:19.153
Fighting the defenses of the heart over time

2566
01:30:19.153 --> 01:30:22.095
from the safety of his tower, he managed to seal it

2567
01:30:22.095 --> 01:30:25.907
within a case of runic imprisonment.

2568
01:30:25.907 --> 01:30:27.867
Then delving into his tomes, Halas found the heart

2569
01:30:27.867 --> 01:30:30.670
to have probably belonged to a nightmarish entity

2570
01:30:30.670 --> 01:30:33.055
called the Laughing Hand, cursed to never die

2571
01:30:33.055 --> 01:30:35.472
by the Crawling King himself.

2572
01:30:36.581 --> 01:30:39.650
Side notes speak of Halas' joy in the warring gods

2573
01:30:39.650 --> 01:30:41.723
keeping themselves distracted, and a lack of interest

2574
01:30:41.723 --> 01:30:44.932
in the fate of this Laughing Hand one way or the other.

2575
01:30:44.932 --> 01:30:48.482
He cares not about the strange battles of these divine.

2576
01:30:48.482 --> 01:30:51.923
Let them stay focused on their middling interests

2577
01:30:51.923 --> 01:30:52.923
and efforts.

2578
01:30:53.819 --> 01:30:56.080
You continue to-- what'd you roll
on your investigation check?

2579
01:30:56.080 --> 01:30:58.063
SAM: 18?
MATT: 18, okay.

2580
01:30:58.948 --> 01:31:00.104
Nothing else really catches your attention

2581
01:31:00.104 --> 01:31:02.563
in the drawers or there on the desk.

2582
01:31:02.563 --> 01:31:04.934
The next batch of notes you go through

2583
01:31:04.934 --> 01:31:07.628
talk of how Halas' experimentation with stolen samples

2584
01:31:07.628 --> 01:31:10.892
of the heart's flesh and the regenerative properties of it.

2585
01:31:10.892 --> 01:31:12.521
LIAM: He got his cooties.

2586
01:31:12.521 --> 01:31:14.553
MATT: His theories involved siphoning the cursed flesh

2587
01:31:14.553 --> 01:31:16.746
from the heart and instituting the undying nature of it

2588
01:31:16.746 --> 01:31:18.792
into a human body.

2589
01:31:18.792 --> 01:31:20.645
Developing a series of magical clones of himself,

2590
01:31:20.645 --> 01:31:24.248
Halas hoped to eventually perfect one such clone

2591
01:31:24.248 --> 01:31:27.029
so that he might claim it and become an eternal

2592
01:31:27.029 --> 01:31:28.897
master of the arcane without having to resort

2593
01:31:28.897 --> 01:31:33.064
to the imperfect and troubling process of lichdom.

2594
01:31:33.982 --> 01:31:36.491
Another batch of notes includes
frantically written complaints

2595
01:31:36.491 --> 01:31:38.595
about failed experiments and the need to jettison

2596
01:31:38.595 --> 01:31:40.267
failed experiments into the Astral Sea

2597
01:31:40.267 --> 01:31:41.943
to make room for another batch.

2598
01:31:41.943 --> 01:31:43.234
(gasping)

2599
01:31:43.234 --> 01:31:45.847
Eventually Halas writes on a successfully developed

2600
01:31:45.847 --> 01:31:49.708
possible vessel, and his need to prepare.

2601
01:31:49.708 --> 01:31:52.217
His theories then descend into methods of soul transference

2602
01:31:52.217 --> 01:31:55.526
via customization of a magical jar,

2603
01:31:55.526 --> 01:31:57.715
and take note of one of his ritual chambers

2604
01:31:57.715 --> 01:32:00.258
within the Dreadnought.

2605
01:32:00.258 --> 01:32:03.841
The writings and dates abruptly stop there.

2606
01:32:07.255 --> 01:32:11.105
LIAM: So I do my best to

2607
01:32:11.105 --> 01:32:14.355
impart all of that.

2608
01:32:14.355 --> 01:32:18.889
He has maybe made a perfect version

2609
01:32:18.889 --> 01:32:21.522
of what we saw back there,

2610
01:32:21.522 --> 01:32:25.897
and it is past the other door.

2611
01:32:27.947 --> 01:32:30.927
TRAVIS: In the Dreadnought, you said?

2612
01:32:30.927 --> 01:32:35.110
It could be a thing, like a room or a vessel?

2613
01:32:36.014 --> 01:32:37.622
LIAM: It's a place.

2614
01:32:39.353 --> 01:32:40.986
LAURA: Wait, what?

2615
01:32:41.968 --> 01:32:45.718
LIAM: The Dreadnought is, I think,

2616
01:32:47.996 --> 01:32:51.404
an entity or a creature, but we are traveling

2617
01:32:51.404 --> 01:32:55.351
into different pockets of reality,

2618
01:32:55.351 --> 01:32:57.663
and I think beyond the door with the purple crystal

2619
01:32:57.663 --> 01:33:01.882
is the Astral Sea.

2620
01:33:01.882 --> 01:33:02.941
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

2621
01:33:02.941 --> 01:33:04.511
LAURA: Oh.

2622
01:33:07.037 --> 01:33:09.097
LIAM: We have the heart.

2623
01:33:09.097 --> 01:33:13.552
TRAVIS: Can I use Divine Sense and look around the room?

2624
01:33:13.552 --> 01:33:14.811
MATT: Okay.

2625
01:33:14.811 --> 01:33:16.929
You don't sense anything that catches your attention

2626
01:33:16.929 --> 01:33:20.023
via the particular attunement of your consciousness

2627
01:33:20.023 --> 01:33:25.013
towards these, you know, undead or fiendish creatures.

2628
01:33:25.013 --> 01:33:27.897
TRAVIS: I walk up and just put the point of my sword

2629
01:33:27.897 --> 01:33:30.855
into the rug, just in case. I don't trust shit.

2630
01:33:30.855 --> 01:33:31.688
MATT: Okay.

2631
01:33:33.592 --> 01:33:34.822
It splinters some of the threads.

2632
01:33:34.822 --> 01:33:37.658
LAURA: Caleb, what was that last part about the jars?

2633
01:33:37.658 --> 01:33:40.226
What was the last part about the jars?

2634
01:33:40.226 --> 01:33:41.933
MATT: His theories descended into methods

2635
01:33:41.933 --> 01:33:45.791
of soul transference via magical jar.

2636
01:33:45.791 --> 01:33:47.013
MARISHA: So he wanted to perfect--

2637
01:33:47.013 --> 01:33:49.202
MATT: He took note of a ritual chamber

2638
01:33:49.202 --> 01:33:51.992
in regards to this research that says it was

2639
01:33:51.992 --> 01:33:53.603
within the Dreadnought.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2640
01:33:53.603 --> 01:33:55.369
MARISHA: It's within the Dreadnought.
MATT: Yeah.

2641
01:33:55.369 --> 01:33:57.327
The translation may be imperfect.

2642
01:33:57.327 --> 01:33:58.448
It is old Zemnian.

2643
01:33:58.448 --> 01:33:59.751
But that's the gist of what you get.

2644
01:33:59.751 --> 01:34:02.026
LIAM: Look around for another door in here.

2645
01:34:02.026 --> 01:34:03.601
I'm going to continue to rifle through the desk.

2646
01:34:03.601 --> 01:34:07.497
MARISHA: I remember back to Avantika's chambers,

2647
01:34:07.497 --> 01:34:11.807
and I think to myself: Rich people always have secret shit.

2648
01:34:11.807 --> 01:34:15.426
I start looking for loose bricks, hidden floorboards.

2649
01:34:15.426 --> 01:34:16.922
MATT: Sure, make an investigation check.

2650
01:34:16.922 --> 01:34:18.727
TRAVIS and MARISHA: False backs.

2651
01:34:18.727 --> 01:34:20.370
TALIESIN: Wait, I'm giving you, I'm going to--

2652
01:34:20.370 --> 01:34:22.936
MARISHA: Oh, Guidance? Okay.

2653
01:34:22.936 --> 01:34:25.882
That's a plus d4?

2654
01:34:25.882 --> 01:34:29.903
I will take that Guidance, because that was shit.

2655
01:34:29.903 --> 01:34:30.736
Okay.

2656
01:34:31.618 --> 01:34:32.514
16.

2657
01:34:32.514 --> 01:34:33.985
MATT: 16.

2658
01:34:33.985 --> 01:34:36.785
Looking through, you do notice that the wood flooring

2659
01:34:36.785 --> 01:34:39.385
underneath the desk, if you move the chair out of the way

2660
01:34:39.385 --> 01:34:41.804
and the floor that's beneath it, most of the wood pattern

2661
01:34:41.804 --> 01:34:44.509
goes from the door to the desk,

2662
01:34:44.509 --> 01:34:46.940
but the square of it underneath the desk is perpendicular

2663
01:34:46.940 --> 01:34:48.345
to the rest of the wood.

2664
01:34:48.345 --> 01:34:49.645
MARISHA: Nott.
SAM: What's up?

2665
01:34:49.645 --> 01:34:50.481
TRAVIS: Lazy.

2666
01:34:50.481 --> 01:34:52.444
MARISHA: Give me that dagger.

2667
01:34:52.444 --> 01:34:54.439
SAM: Give me a banana.

2668
01:34:54.439 --> 01:34:55.589
(laughter)

2669
01:34:55.589 --> 01:34:57.167
MARISHA: I don't--

2670
01:34:57.167 --> 01:34:59.015
SAM: Do you have a banana?

2671
01:34:59.015 --> 01:35:00.911
MARISHA: Are you still having that craving?

2672
01:35:00.911 --> 01:35:02.643
It's been, like, 30 minutes.

2673
01:35:02.643 --> 01:35:03.476
SAM: I know, but I was just--

2674
01:35:03.476 --> 01:35:06.004
it felt so weird to be that big. I was--

2675
01:35:06.004 --> 01:35:09.153
LAURA: I'm going to paint a banana with my paint.

2676
01:35:09.153 --> 01:35:10.363
MATT: Okay.

2677
01:35:10.363 --> 01:35:12.005
SAM: You don't know what it's-- oh, thank you!

2678
01:35:12.005 --> 01:35:13.466
LAURA: You're welcome.

2679
01:35:13.466 --> 01:35:16.518
SAM: (chewing) Wow.

2680
01:35:16.518 --> 01:35:19.409
MATT: Tastes strangely accurate, though it looks a little

2681
01:35:19.409 --> 01:35:21.609
funny and Saturday morning cartoonish.

2682
01:35:21.609 --> 01:35:23.604
(laughter)

2683
01:35:23.604 --> 01:35:24.744
SAM: It's just so weird.

2684
01:35:24.744 --> 01:35:26.385
TALIESIN: Is it like that fake banana flavor, though?

2685
01:35:26.385 --> 01:35:27.218
Is it like--

2686
01:35:27.218 --> 01:35:30.191
MATT: Yeah, it's more like Runts banana

2687
01:35:30.191 --> 01:35:34.732
than an actual legitimate banana.
TRAVIS: Scratch-n-sniff banana markers?

2688
01:35:34.732 --> 01:35:37.169
SAM: I'm going to keep the peel for comedy.

2689
01:35:37.169 --> 01:35:39.394
(laughter)

2690
01:35:40.577 --> 01:35:42.923
MATT: Put that in your inventory. Don't forget that.

2691
01:35:42.923 --> 01:35:44.195
You never know.

2692
01:35:44.195 --> 01:35:45.503
LAURA: It won't rot.
MATT: It won't rot,

2693
01:35:45.503 --> 01:35:47.253
because it is magically developed.

2694
01:35:47.253 --> 01:35:48.854
TRAVIS: I'll move away from the desk.

2695
01:35:48.854 --> 01:35:50.451
I'm going to back up.
MATT: Okay.

2696
01:35:50.451 --> 01:35:51.861
TRAVIS: Are you going to check for traps?

2697
01:35:51.861 --> 01:35:53.932
MARISHA: Now that you've had your snack,

2698
01:35:53.932 --> 01:35:55.145
you want to check your traps here?

2699
01:35:55.145 --> 01:35:56.642
SAM: Yes.

2700
01:35:56.642 --> 01:35:59.491
Make way for the king of the jungle.

2701
01:35:59.491 --> 01:36:00.714
(laughter)

2702
01:36:00.714 --> 01:36:01.547
MATT: Investigation check.

2703
01:36:01.547 --> 01:36:02.426
SAM: Jungle VIP.

2704
01:36:02.426 --> 01:36:05.700
TRAVIS: I don't think gorillas are the king.

2705
01:36:05.700 --> 01:36:07.409
SAM: I don't know how it works.

2706
01:36:07.409 --> 01:36:10.003
I know I've just, I've reached the top.

2707
01:36:10.003 --> 01:36:10.836
All right.

2708
01:36:11.880 --> 01:36:13.442
I'm going to investigate the floorboards.

2709
01:36:13.442 --> 01:36:15.078
MATT: Yes.
SAM: And that's a 19.

2710
01:36:15.078 --> 01:36:16.465
MATT: 19, okay.

2711
01:36:16.465 --> 01:36:19.647
They are not trapped, from what best you can tell.

2712
01:36:19.647 --> 01:36:22.250
You also don't see the mechanism of which to lift them.

2713
01:36:22.250 --> 01:36:24.770
There's no like handle.

2714
01:36:24.770 --> 01:36:26.383
MARISHA: Can I see that dagger?

2715
01:36:26.383 --> 01:36:27.216
SAM: Sure.

2716
01:36:28.885 --> 01:36:31.492
MATT: There's not enough space to wedge it.

2717
01:36:31.492 --> 01:36:34.338
LAURA: Look for a button, look for a button, everyone.

2718
01:36:34.338 --> 01:36:36.600
SAM: Good idea, Jester.

2719
01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:38.296
MARISHA: Search for--
LIAM: Hidden compartments--

2720
01:36:38.296 --> 01:36:39.631
LAURA: Or a book or something.

2721
01:36:39.631 --> 01:36:40.620
MARISHA: Yeah, search for a mechanism.

2722
01:36:40.620 --> 01:36:41.825
MATT: Make an investigation check.

2723
01:36:41.825 --> 01:36:44.654
TALIESIN: I'm going to do a quick Detect Magic in here.

2724
01:36:44.654 --> 01:36:47.078
LAURA: Can I search for a mechanism too, or a button?

2725
01:36:47.078 --> 01:36:49.580
MATT: Yeah, make an investigation check.
LIAM: 18 investigation.

2726
01:36:49.580 --> 01:36:50.473
TALIESIN: Does Detect Magic do anything?

2727
01:36:50.473 --> 01:36:51.465
LAURA: Natural 20!

2728
01:36:51.465 --> 01:36:53.117
MARISHA: Eyy!
MATT: Nice.

2729
01:36:53.117 --> 01:36:56.632
Detect Magic, you don't detect anything

2730
01:36:56.632 --> 01:37:01.632
specifically magical within this chamber, any more at least.

2731
01:37:02.268 --> 01:37:03.971
TALIESIN: But like nothing is giving off a glow

2732
01:37:03.971 --> 01:37:05.197
other than the candles?

2733
01:37:05.197 --> 01:37:06.493
MATT: Other than the maybe the candles

2734
01:37:06.493 --> 01:37:08.606
and the doorway behind you where you entered,

2735
01:37:08.606 --> 01:37:12.097
and a faint aura below the floor.

2736
01:37:12.097 --> 01:37:14.509
TALIESIN: There's a weird bit of magic underneath the floor.

2737
01:37:14.509 --> 01:37:16.766
MATT: The desk you go through and end up following

2738
01:37:16.766 --> 01:37:18.781
the same paths and searching the same things

2739
01:37:18.781 --> 01:37:22.656
that Nott did, but nothing additionally is found.

2740
01:37:22.656 --> 01:37:24.725
Jester, as you're going along the shelves

2741
01:37:24.725 --> 01:37:27.001
and you see all the various jars of flesh,

2742
01:37:27.001 --> 01:37:29.796
you can see like a lot of these are bits and slivers

2743
01:37:29.796 --> 01:37:34.175
of whatever this heart that was referred to

2744
01:37:34.175 --> 01:37:36.252
in the notes are in different sizes and shapes,

2745
01:37:36.252 --> 01:37:37.400
and as you approach and flick one,

2746
01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:40.917
it quivers, and as you listen to that heartbeat sound,

2747
01:37:40.917 --> 01:37:43.746
you can see faintly each piece pulse

2748
01:37:43.746 --> 01:37:47.279
with the same rhythm of the heartbeat.

2749
01:37:47.279 --> 01:37:50.898
Coming cross across them on the far shelf behind it,

2750
01:37:50.898 --> 01:37:54.114
you can see there's a lantern that's like very vaguely lit,

2751
01:37:54.114 --> 01:37:55.278
and you go and start moving across,

2752
01:37:55.278 --> 01:37:59.205
but the lantern won't move, it's like solid in place.

2753
01:37:59.205 --> 01:38:00.653
You go ahead and grab the top of it and pull,

2754
01:38:00.653 --> 01:38:04.079
and as it pulls, it hinges, and the wood beneath the desk

2755
01:38:04.079 --> 01:38:06.928
(creaking) opens into a staircase

2756
01:38:06.928 --> 01:38:08.977
that descends down into shadow.

2757
01:38:08.977 --> 01:38:09.920
LAURA: Tight, tight, tight.

2758
01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:14.527
TRAVIS: Should we take these pieces of heart tissue with us?

2759
01:38:14.527 --> 01:38:18.747
LAURA: Maybe we can see what hurts it, and then, you know,

2760
01:38:18.747 --> 01:38:21.029
if we can like burn a little piece of it

2761
01:38:21.029 --> 01:38:22.788
or cold a little piece of it.

2762
01:38:22.788 --> 01:38:24.646
TRAVIS: Fleshy tendrils, right?

2763
01:38:24.646 --> 01:38:26.949
Seems like it'll defend itself.
TALIESIN: Can you actually do your thing?

2764
01:38:26.949 --> 01:38:27.940
MARISHA: Hmm?

2765
01:38:27.940 --> 01:38:30.715
TRAVIS: Extract Aspects?
LAURA: Oh yeah, Extract Aspects of the--

2766
01:38:30.715 --> 01:38:32.616
SAM: Didn't Caleb read that it's sealed?

2767
01:38:32.616 --> 01:38:34.428
It's sealed in something, the heart is now

2768
01:38:34.428 --> 01:38:36.192
sealed in something, so--
LAURA: Right, we're going to have to--

2769
01:38:36.192 --> 01:38:37.464
MARISHA: Maybe we can open a jar.

2770
01:38:37.464 --> 01:38:39.604
SAM: Or maybe we can just pick it up and take it with us,

2771
01:38:39.604 --> 01:38:40.478
because it's--
MARISHA: I could try and

2772
01:38:40.478 --> 01:38:42.712
Extract Aspects from it, I don't know.

2773
01:38:42.712 --> 01:38:43.687
LAURA: But from one of the

2774
01:38:43.687 --> 01:38:45.188
little pieces, I mean.
LIAM: The heart is separate than

2775
01:38:45.188 --> 01:38:46.304
the jar, right?
MATT: Correct.

2776
01:38:46.304 --> 01:38:47.267
TRAVIS: Yeah, the heart is in a magical plane,

2777
01:38:47.267 --> 01:38:50.537
but he dispelled the plane, the magical bonds.

2778
01:38:50.537 --> 01:38:54.209
MATT: The jar was sealed in
some sort of a magical containment

2779
01:38:54.209 --> 01:38:55.743
and he dispelled it to study it.

2780
01:38:55.743 --> 01:38:56.726
LIAM: The heart was.

2781
01:38:56.726 --> 01:38:58.266
MATT: The heart was, but then realized that it had

2782
01:38:58.266 --> 01:39:00.701
defense mechanisms, so he resealed it.

2783
01:39:00.701 --> 01:39:01.687
LAURA: In runes.

2784
01:39:01.687 --> 01:39:04.092
MATT: Yeah, in like its own containment.

2785
01:39:04.092 --> 01:39:06.667
LIAM: The jar is its own--
SAM: It's in a thing, it's in an ark.

2786
01:39:06.667 --> 01:39:07.978
TALIESIN: Little slivers of heart.

2787
01:39:07.978 --> 01:39:08.878
TRAVIS: Can't take one of these

2788
01:39:08.878 --> 01:39:10.478
tissue pieces and be like boop?

2789
01:39:10.478 --> 01:39:12.728
LAURA: Yeah, see what the tissue, like what will hurt

2790
01:39:12.728 --> 01:39:13.799
the tissues, and then we'll know

2791
01:39:13.799 --> 01:39:15.162
what will hurt the heart, right?

2792
01:39:15.162 --> 01:39:18.894
LIAM: Here is a glass vial if you want to put some in it.

2793
01:39:18.894 --> 01:39:19.844
LAURA: Well, there's all these little--

2794
01:39:19.844 --> 01:39:22.245
MATT: I will say you would know, from Extract Aspects,

2795
01:39:22.245 --> 01:39:24.415
it's not just like finding a sliver of something,

2796
01:39:24.415 --> 01:39:26.388
it's about being able to connect to your ki

2797
01:39:26.388 --> 01:39:27.721
with whatever entity you're striking,

2798
01:39:27.721 --> 01:39:29.129
and a small sliver wouldn't be enough

2799
01:39:29.129 --> 01:39:31.120
to draw information about that entire being.

2800
01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:31.953
MARISHA: Okay.

2801
01:39:31.953 --> 01:39:33.649
TRAVIS: If we need a snack later.

2802
01:39:33.649 --> 01:39:34.813
MATT: There is that.

2803
01:39:34.813 --> 01:39:37.755
MARISHA: Well, regardless, I'm going in the hole.

2804
01:39:37.755 --> 01:39:40.172
What's in this hole?
MATT: Okay, marching order?

2805
01:39:40.172 --> 01:39:41.468
MARISHA: Oh, you can go down the hole.

2806
01:39:41.468 --> 01:39:43.119
MATT: Yeah. No, it's a staircase that descends.

2807
01:39:43.119 --> 01:39:44.244
LAURA: Down to the heart.

2808
01:39:44.244 --> 01:39:45.733
We're going to the heart.

2809
01:39:45.733 --> 01:39:48.487
LIAM: A question about his writing.

2810
01:39:48.487 --> 01:39:51.987
Was it so old that it seemed pre-Calamity?

2811
01:39:54.984 --> 01:39:59.799
MATT: His conversation initially about the

2812
01:39:59.799 --> 01:40:03.080
gods busying themselves and the Crawling King

2813
01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:05.644
leads you to know that there was conversation about deities,

2814
01:40:05.644 --> 01:40:07.675
but there's nothing about specifically the Calamity.

2815
01:40:07.675 --> 01:40:10.951
The only thing you'd know is the study that you guys

2816
01:40:10.951 --> 01:40:12.758
went to the first time, and it had the large

2817
01:40:12.758 --> 01:40:16.935
stained glass interpretation of all of like

2818
01:40:16.935 --> 01:40:19.551
the Inner and Outer Planes, did not have a Divine Gate,

2819
01:40:19.551 --> 01:40:22.590
whereas all modern, similar maps does have a Divine Gate.

2820
01:40:22.590 --> 01:40:24.658
However, that is more of an indicator

2821
01:40:24.658 --> 01:40:26.651
of when it was constructed. You don't know--

2822
01:40:26.651 --> 01:40:31.072
you have no sense really of what time has passed here.

2823
01:40:31.072 --> 01:40:32.347
MARISHA: Yeah, because we know that that

2824
01:40:32.347 --> 01:40:35.714
stained glass window was a pre-Calamity map.

2825
01:40:35.714 --> 01:40:37.377
MATT: Correct.

2826
01:40:37.377 --> 01:40:41.284
TRAVIS: I will light up the sword
and I will go into the hole.

2827
01:40:41.284 --> 01:40:42.760
MATT: So Beau, then Fjord?

2828
01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:43.646
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

2829
01:40:43.646 --> 01:40:44.479
MATT: Okay.

2830
01:40:45.741 --> 01:40:47.534
Beau, Fjord.
MARISHA: Get into the hole!

2831
01:40:47.534 --> 01:40:48.758
MATT: Who's after?

2832
01:40:48.758 --> 01:40:50.008
SAM: I'll go next.

2833
01:40:51.017 --> 01:40:52.389
LIAM: I will go after Nott.

2834

TALIESIN: Best to split them up.

2847
01:41:15.773 --> 01:41:17.242

LAURA: Okay.

2851
01:41:21.026 --> 01:41:23.797
[heartbeat]
SAM: Oh, it's louder.

2852
01:41:23.797 --> 01:41:25.671
Oh, that's disconcerting.
MATT: You enter

2853
01:41:25.671 --> 01:41:30.671
a low-lit triangular room of dark red stone.

2854
01:41:30.946 --> 01:41:33.018
The surfaces glistening with moisture,

2855
01:41:33.018 --> 01:41:36.915
the humid air of the room smelling strongly of iron.

2856
01:41:36.915 --> 01:41:40.456
As your eyes focus into the low-lit interior,

2857
01:41:40.456 --> 01:41:42.653
the corners of your vision almost catch elements

2858
01:41:42.653 --> 01:41:45.057
of the walls and floors slowly moving,

2859
01:41:45.057 --> 01:41:48.987
like you've eaten something toxic that now alters your mind.

2860
01:41:48.987 --> 01:41:51.895
A deep heavy thrum reverberates rhythmically

2861
01:41:51.895 --> 01:41:55.240
throughout the chamber, the source of the sound

2862
01:41:55.240 --> 01:41:57.785
sitting central to the chamber.

2863
01:41:57.785 --> 01:42:01.342
Under a shimmering case of arcane-reinforced glass

2864
01:42:01.342 --> 01:42:05.778
lies the swollen, beating heart of the Laughing Hand,

2865
01:42:05.778 --> 01:42:08.035
dangling from its aorta.

2866
01:42:08.035 --> 01:42:11.014
Numerous glyphs line the containment glass,

2867
01:42:11.014 --> 01:42:13.558
while much of it is smeared with gore from the inside,

2868
01:42:13.558 --> 01:42:16.484
elements of flesh collected at its bottom,

2869
01:42:16.484 --> 01:42:20.680
which appear to have somewhat breached the containment

2870
01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:23.925
as tendrils of wet, red flesh spiral outward

2871
01:42:23.925 --> 01:42:26.703
from beneath the Permaheart to encompass

2872
01:42:26.703 --> 01:42:27.947
the majority of the room.

2873
01:42:27.947 --> 01:42:28.780
ALL: Ooh.

2874
01:42:28.780 --> 01:42:30.620

I mean, it's been in here for a long time.

2877
01:42:34.192 --> 01:42:36.504
MATT: The heartbeat intensifies in your presence

2878
01:42:36.504 --> 01:42:39.340
and a wave of sickening pain sparks into your body.

2879
01:42:39.340 --> 01:42:40.338
MARISHA: Oh my god.

2880
01:42:40.338 --> 01:42:41.633

2900

Wing, whatever, I'm so sorry.

2901
01:43:23.145 --> 01:43:24.397
I know I've heard it a million times,

2902
01:43:24.397 --> 01:43:25.639
but I've also messed it up a million times,

2903
01:43:25.639 --> 01:43:26.751
so I don't know what's right and what's wrong.

2904

2907

(somber Western music)

2935
01:44:48.695 --> 01:44:53.695
TRAVIS: Our Father, we gather here as strangers,

2936
01:44:53.731 --> 01:44:58.731
brought together by gold, now bound by fate and fear.

2937
01:44:59.482 --> 01:45:04.482
We remain steadfast in our bodies and in our minds.

2938
01:45:04.582 --> 01:45:09.557
But this evil we face now meets us ill-prepared.

2939
01:45:10.990 --> 01:45:14.016
For guidance, we ask you now.

2940
01:45:14.016 --> 01:45:17.263
For protection.

2941
01:45:17.263 --> 01:45:21.763
Not just for our lives, but for our very souls.

2942
01:45:23.113 --> 01:45:28.105
Be our light as we enter the darkness.

2943
01:45:37.142 --> 01:45:42.133
(soft crackling)

2944
01:45:53.620 --> 01:45:56.792
WILL: Hey everyone, the insanely talented Will Friedle here.

2945
01:45:56.792 --> 01:45:58.239
I'm excited to announce that I have a new

2946
01:45:58.239 --> 01:45:59.450
late night talk show coming to

2947
01:45:59.450 --> 01:46:01.715
the Critical Role YouTube channel on Wednesdays

2948
01:46:01.715 --> 01:46:03.494
called Mini Primetime.

2949
01:46:03.494 --> 01:46:06.512
It's brought to you by the same creators as that one show

2950
01:46:06.512 --> 01:46:09.502
with the hippie kid with the bracelets, whatever that is.

2951
01:46:09.502 --> 01:46:13.056
Anyway, my show, Mini Primetime, is a mini painting show

2952
01:46:13.056 --> 01:46:15.998
for beginners and veterans alike where this handsome face

2953
01:46:15.998 --> 01:46:17.354
teaches the Critical Role cast

2954
01:46:17.354 --> 01:46:19.291
how to paint their own Mighty Nein minis.

2955
01:46:19.291 --> 01:46:21.264
We're going to be focusing on specific techniques

2956
01:46:21.264 --> 01:46:24.246
like fade, small detail work, and taking your mini

2957
01:46:24.246 --> 01:46:26.299
to the next level by adding to your base.

2958
01:46:26.299 --> 01:46:29.508
Look for it soon on Critical Role's YouTube.

2959
01:46:29.508 --> 01:46:30.667
Critical Role, what is that?

2960
01:46:30.667 --> 01:46:32.555
What is even a critical role?

2961
01:46:32.555 --> 01:46:34.459
Oh, that's right.

2962
01:46:34.459 --> 01:46:36.792
That was the show with Kash.

2963
01:46:46.568 --> 01:46:51.501
(jazzy saxophone music)

2964
01:47:01.737 --> 01:47:04.182
BRIAN (V.O.): Last time on Talks Machina.

2965
01:47:04.182 --> 01:47:07.193
"Of late, it appears the Mighty Nein's first instinct

2966
01:47:07.193 --> 01:47:09.113
"is to run from a fight.

2967
01:47:09.113 --> 01:47:11.830
"Do they have a confidence problem

2968
01:47:11.830 --> 01:47:14.249
"or is it a more serious form of PTSD

2969
01:47:14.249 --> 01:47:16.618
"after their first encounter with the Laughing Hand?"

2970
01:47:16.618 --> 01:47:18.647
(laughter)

2971
01:47:18.647 --> 01:47:21.230
BRIAN: Very good question, Boffleslop.

2972
01:47:23.033 --> 01:47:24.271
DANI: Y'all running from shit.

2973
01:47:24.271 --> 01:47:25.746
TRAVIS: I mean, look.

2974
01:47:25.746 --> 01:47:27.927
MARISHA: I love questions that are insults.

2975
01:47:27.927 --> 01:47:29.973
(laughter)

2976
01:47:29.973 --> 01:47:32.236
BRIAN: This is my brand of question.

2977
01:47:32.236 --> 01:47:36.343
TRAVIS: You fuckin' bitches
run at the first sign of trouble.

2978
01:47:36.343 --> 01:47:39.658
BRIAN: The first half of it is, "Hey cowards.

2979
01:47:39.658 --> 01:47:41.751
"Quick question, cowards."

2980
01:47:41.751 --> 01:47:43.304
Then the second half is like,

2981
01:47:43.304 --> 01:47:46.137
"Are you going to suck like you did
that other time you sucked?"

2982
01:47:46.137 --> 01:47:47.893
"With the time difference in the heirloom sphere,"

2983
01:47:47.893 --> 01:47:50.358
Taliesin also one of my top five,

2984
01:47:50.358 --> 01:47:52.999
"Traveler Con gets closer and closer.

2985
01:47:52.999 --> 01:47:56.620
"Are they at all worried about Jester's cult?

2986
01:47:56.620 --> 01:47:58.295
"Do you think Jester's being duped,

2987
01:47:58.295 --> 01:48:00.259
"or do you trust what she believes in?"

2988
01:48:00.259 --> 01:48:03.422
TRAVIS: It's a fucking cult, man!

2989
01:48:03.422 --> 01:48:05.868
It's happening in a volcano!

2990
01:48:05.868 --> 01:48:07.951
Everybody's going to die!

2991
01:48:09.082 --> 01:48:10.188
There's no illusions!

2992
01:48:10.188 --> 01:48:12.059
DANI: Isn't it technically on an island now?

2993
01:48:12.059 --> 01:48:13.199
Didn't they like--

2994
01:48:13.199 --> 01:48:15.704
BRIAN: They are giving out little communion glasses

2995
01:48:15.704 --> 01:48:16.672
full of Kool-Aid.

2996
01:48:16.672 --> 01:48:19.215
TRAVIS: Let's remember what happened in campaign one.

2997
01:48:19.215 --> 01:48:23.155
Kill a bunch of people, ascend to godhood.

2998
01:48:23.155 --> 01:48:24.916
MARISHA: What's funny is she had that--

2999
01:48:24.916 --> 01:48:25.953
BRIAN: Spoilers.

3000
01:48:25.953 --> 01:48:29.139
MARISHA: She had that amazing moment where she was like,

3001
01:48:29.139 --> 01:48:33.030
"No, it's not a cult, I mean, oh shit you guys,

3002
01:48:33.030 --> 01:48:34.314
"I think it's a cult."

3003
01:48:34.314 --> 01:48:38.441
BRIAN: It's time for Cosplay of the Week, my friends.

3004
01:48:38.441 --> 01:48:42.330
TRAVIS and DANI: ♪ Cosplay of the Week ♪

Watch this.

3008
01:48:48.635 --> 01:48:50.975
TRAVIS: Oh my gosh!

3009
01:48:50.975 --> 01:48:51.857
MARISHA: Shut up.

3010
01:48:51.857 --> 01:48:52.782
BRIAN: Little Twiggy cosplay.

3011

TRAVIS: So freaking cute.

MARISHA: Oh my goodness.

3013
01:48:56.751 --> 01:48:57.966
DANI: And she's got Trixie.

01:48:57.966 --> 01:48:59.599
TRAVIS: Are those little apples?

01:48:59.599 --> 01:49:03.057
MARISHA: Look at her little booties.

3016
01:49:03.057 --> 01:49:05.186
DANI: Some of the detail on the skirt.
MARISHA: Oh my god.

3017
01:49:05.186 --> 01:49:06.369
DANI: It's so good.

3018

01:49:07.798 --> 01:49:09.775
Brittany would be dying.

3020
01:49:09.775 --> 01:49:13.265
BRIAN: "Fjord and Caduceus missed Wild's Grandeur,

3021
01:49:13.265 --> 01:49:17.103
"the holiday to the Wildmother, while inside the sphere."

3022
01:49:17.103 --> 01:49:19.566
So you missed the Wildmother's holiday, because y'all--

3023
01:49:19.566 --> 01:49:22.672
TRAVIS: I know, I'm a good paladin.

3024
01:49:22.672 --> 01:49:25.382
My iCalendar doesn't sync in the Happy Fun Ball.

01:49:27.908 --> 01:49:30.516
Those holidays just (wooshing).
MARISHA: I swear, Wildmother,

3027
01:49:30.516 --> 01:49:32.357
we were in a different time zone

3028
01:49:32.357 --> 01:49:34.490
when I put this appointment in.

3029
01:49:34.490 --> 01:49:36.238
I'm so sorry.

3030
01:49:36.238 --> 01:49:38.405
TRAVIS: It didn't sync up right.

3031
01:49:38.405 --> 01:49:39.504
BRIAN: Yep, yep..

3032
01:49:39.504 --> 01:49:42.995
"After Mica Burton's fantastic appearance on Pub Draw,

"will be enough to save your job as host of Talks?"

01:49:51.187 --> 01:49:52.812
DANI: It's a good question.

3036
01:49:52.812 --> 01:49:55.312
BRIAN: I resent you, Alex.

3037
01:49:57.049 --> 01:49:59.277
I resent you for sure.

3038
01:49:59.277 --> 01:50:01.359
I feel-- you know, I ran into Mica

3039
01:50:01.359 --> 01:50:02.757
when I was at New York Comic Con.

3040
01:50:02.757 --> 01:50:04.969
TRAVIS: You ran into or followed?

TRAVIS: Ooh.
MARISHA: (exhales)

3050
01:50:25.524 --> 01:50:27.252
TRAVIS: That's actually good, I like that.

3051
01:50:27.252 --> 01:50:29.597
MARISHA: That is very good.
TRAVIS: No detectable, insult found.

3052
01:50:29.597 --> 01:50:31.946
MARISHA: No, that is insanely deep and profound.

3053
01:50:31.946 --> 01:50:34.053
TRAVIS: In preliminary scanning.

3054
01:50:34.053 --> 01:50:37.194
MARISHA: I think the way she presents

3055
01:50:37.194 --> 01:50:40.097
is very important to her,

3056
01:50:40.097 --> 01:50:45.097
because she was forced to present a different way

3057
01:50:45.107 --> 01:50:48.904
her entire life, like from her dad and her parents,

3058
01:50:48.904 --> 01:50:52.821
and just forcing this other identity

3059
01:50:52.821 --> 01:50:55.237
that she didn't subscribe to.

3060
01:50:57.261 --> 01:51:00.456
A lot of that dealt with, you know,

3061
01:51:00.456 --> 01:51:04.140
the presentation and the outward

3062
01:51:07.815 --> 01:51:10.568
air that everything is great and fine

3063
01:51:10.568 --> 01:51:13.305
and you're the perfect little girl.

3064
01:51:13.305 --> 01:51:16.753
BRIAN: Someday, if I'm a CEO, I'll get to dress

3065
01:51:16.753 --> 01:51:19.478
like I'm settling in to watch Lord of the Rings, too.

BRITTANY: "Ooh!"

3090
01:52:30.723 --> 01:52:33.104
BRIAN: What, oh no, it's already happening, dude.

3091
01:52:33.104 --> 01:52:35.103
TRAVIS: Oh god.
BRITTANY: "Woo!

3092
01:52:35.103 --> 01:52:37.497
"Ooh!"

3093
01:52:37.497 --> 01:52:38.350
BRIAN: What?

3094
01:52:38.350 --> 01:52:41.112
BRITTANY: "Is there anyone there?

3095
01:52:41.112 --> 01:52:43.279
"Ooh!"

3096
01:52:43.279 --> 01:52:44.439
TRAVIS: Don't make contact!

3097
01:52:44.439 --> 01:52:45.822
BRIAN: Hey, hey, hey ghost, are you lost?

3098
01:52:45.822 --> 01:52:46.884
TRAVIS: Don't open yourself up!

3099
01:52:46.884 --> 01:52:48.838
BRIAN: Are you lost, can we help you?

3100
01:52:48.838 --> 01:52:53.663
BRITTANY: "Which one of God's forgotten stepchildren
speaks to me?

3101
01:52:53.663 --> 01:52:54.496
"Ooh!"

3102
01:52:55.361 --> 01:52:56.824
TRAVIS: You're getting shit from beyond the grave.

3103
01:52:56.824 --> 01:52:58.649
BRIAN: I can't-- nowhere's safe.

3104
01:52:58.649 --> 01:53:00.228
My name is Brian.

3105
01:53:00.228 --> 01:53:01.808
Where are you trying to go?

3106
01:53:01.808 --> 01:53:03.625
BRITTANY: "That voice.

3107
01:53:03.625 --> 01:53:06.456
"It sounds so familiar.

3108
01:53:06.456 --> 01:53:10.756
"I feel as if I heard it a long time ago.

3109
01:53:10.756 --> 01:53:12.316
BRIAN: Wait a second.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3110
01:53:12.316 --> 01:53:14.679
BRIAN: Travis, that voice sounds familiar to me.

3111
01:53:14.679 --> 01:53:16.745
There's no way in hell that's T.N.--

3112
01:53:16.745 --> 01:53:18.336
TRAVIS: I feel like I recognized it.

3113
01:53:18.336 --> 01:53:21.292
BRITTANY: "Oh, that's right, you cringe wizard!"

3114
01:53:21.292 --> 01:53:22.223
(laughter)

3115
01:53:22.223 --> 01:53:24.515
"It's me, T.N.Tina!

3116
01:53:25.510 --> 01:53:29.882
"And I'm a fuckin' g-g-g-ghost!"

3117
01:53:29.882 --> 01:53:32.438
BRIAN: Fuck, Tina!

3118
01:53:32.438 --> 01:53:34.534
TRAVIS: Amazing!
BRIAN: Tina's back!

3119
01:53:34.534 --> 01:53:36.142
Awesome!

3120
01:53:36.142 --> 01:53:39.547
BRITTANY: "Yeah, thanks a lot, you little bitches!

3121
01:53:39.547 --> 01:53:42.014
"You both didn't do anything to stop me

3122
01:53:42.014 --> 01:53:44.790
"from getting my head ripped off."
TRAVIS: No, we really didn't.

3123
01:53:44.790 --> 01:53:47.873
BRITTANY: "I'd expect that from you, you cowardly waste

3124
01:53:47.873 --> 01:53:49.854
"of unlimited atoms!"

3125
01:53:49.854 --> 01:53:50.897
BRIAN: Oh.

3126
01:53:50.897 --> 01:53:53.231
Well, what have you been up to since you

3127
01:53:53.231 --> 01:53:55.366
went into the clouds?

3128
01:53:55.366 --> 01:53:59.210
BRITTANY: "Well, after I got my fuckin' head ripped off,

3129
01:53:59.210 --> 01:54:04.210
"I saw a bright light at the end of a long tunnel.

3130
01:54:04.678 --> 01:54:08.925
"I felt my body being pulled, and I began to barrel

3131
01:54:08.925 --> 01:54:12.824
"towards the light, faster and faster,

3132
01:54:12.824 --> 01:54:17.823
"until a huge green aura wiped across my eyes.

3133
01:54:17.823 --> 01:54:20.273
"I had then reached it."

3134
01:54:21.578 --> 01:54:23.135
BRIAN: Reached it?

3135
01:54:23.135 --> 01:54:27.005
Reached what?
BRITTANY: "The Gates of Diemore."

3136
01:54:27.005 --> 01:54:30.090
BRIAN: That's the place Redbird mentioned

3137
01:54:30.090 --> 01:54:32.561
back at that shitty-ass jungle.

3138
01:54:32.561 --> 01:54:35.133
What's the Diemore again, Tina?

3139
01:54:35.133 --> 01:54:37.666
BRITTANY: "The Diemore is the holy plane

3140
01:54:37.666 --> 01:54:39.449
"that all critters go to

3141
01:54:39.449 --> 01:54:43.230
"when their souls have been released by the Ove."

3142
01:54:43.230 --> 01:54:44.766
BRIAN: Who is "Oh"?

3143
01:54:44.766 --> 01:54:46.711
BRITTANY: "You really don't know shit."

3144
01:54:46.711 --> 01:54:49.423
TRAVIS: (laughs)

3145
01:54:49.423 --> 01:54:52.185
BRITTANY: "Ove is the 12th and final maker."

3146
01:54:52.185 --> 01:54:53.018
BRIAN: What?

3147
01:54:53.018 --> 01:54:56.425
BRITTANY: "Now go play the spooky game and don't forget

3148
01:54:56.425 --> 01:54:59.625
"the prophecy!"

3149
01:54:59.625 --> 01:55:01.707
TRAVIS: Oh Tina, Tina, don't leave us!

3150
01:55:01.707 --> 01:55:03.923
Tina, don't leave us!

3151
01:55:05.168 --> 01:55:06.168
What's that?

3152
01:55:07.092 --> 01:55:08.334
It's a mountain.

3153
01:55:08.334 --> 01:55:11.898
BRIAN: I'm sweating like Sam when he
gets a letter from the IRS.

3154
01:55:13.290 --> 01:55:14.986
TRAVIS: Oh god.
BRIAN: Get in there.

3155
01:55:14.986 --> 01:55:16.231
TRAVIS: Okay.

3156
01:55:16.231 --> 01:55:17.717
I'm going in.

3157
01:55:17.717 --> 01:55:18.563
Oh god!

3158
01:55:18.563 --> 01:55:19.508
BRIAN: Record it, record it.

3159
01:55:19.508 --> 01:55:21.795
TRAVIS: I'm recording! Night vision!
BRIAN: Night vision!

3160
01:55:21.795 --> 01:55:25.029
Oh no, dude, if we have to do this through night vision,

3161
01:55:25.029 --> 01:55:26.452
I'm not doing it.

3162
01:55:26.452 --> 01:55:28.869
I thought maybe like a flashlight, but that shit is,

3163
01:55:28.869 --> 01:55:30.478
I don't think so, dude.
TRAVIS: Keep your back to the wall.

3164
01:55:30.478 --> 01:55:31.875
BRIAN: Something's shiny on the table.

3165
01:55:31.875 --> 01:55:32.708
TRAVIS: What are you talking about!

3166
01:55:32.708 --> 01:55:33.541
BRIAN: Something shiny on the table.

3167
01:55:33.541 --> 01:55:34.374
Touch it, touch it.

3168
01:55:34.374 --> 01:55:35.754
TRAVIS: It's a confidential file, here we go.

3169
01:55:35.754 --> 01:55:37.110
This is not so bad.

3170
01:55:37.110 --> 01:55:38.221
We're fine.

3171
01:55:38.221 --> 01:55:39.294
I don't even want to read it.

3172
01:55:39.294 --> 01:55:40.129
I don't care.

3173
01:55:40.129 --> 01:55:42.621
BRIAN: It might tell us more--
TRAVIS: I don't need context!

3174
01:55:42.621 --> 01:55:44.014
I need to survive.

3175
01:55:44.014 --> 01:55:44.911
BRIAN: Pro.

3176
01:55:44.911 --> 01:55:46.233
TRAVIS: That's blocked.

3177
01:55:46.233 --> 01:55:47.867
Don't try the blocked door.

3178
01:55:47.867 --> 01:55:51.319
BRIAN: That's where the dude was, man.

3179
01:55:51.319 --> 01:55:52.880
(screaming)

3180
01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:54.461
TRAVIS: Fucking shit!

3181
01:55:54.461 --> 01:55:55.395
BRIAN: I knew it.

3182
01:55:55.395 --> 01:55:56.692
Fuck!

3183
01:55:56.692 --> 01:55:57.525
I knew it.

3184
01:55:57.525 --> 01:55:59.374
Goddamn it, Max.

3185
01:55:59.374 --> 01:56:02.814
I've mastered the art of candy corn chucking.

3186
01:56:02.814 --> 01:56:03.774
Battery.

3187
01:56:03.774 --> 01:56:05.357
TRAVIS: I know, I see it.

3188
01:56:07.702 --> 01:56:09.780
BRIAN: Wow! Jerry,

3189
01:56:09.780 --> 01:56:11.337
I'm on fire.

3190
01:56:11.337 --> 01:56:12.399
VO: Little pig!

3191
01:56:12.399 --> 01:56:13.413
(dramatic music)

3192
01:56:13.413 --> 01:56:14.246
BRIAN: No!

3193
01:56:14.246 --> 01:56:16.602
TRAVIS: What the fuck is that?!

3194
01:56:16.602 --> 01:56:18.122
BRIAN: Oh, I'm going to choke on shit.

3195
01:56:18.122 --> 01:56:19.158
Fuck that.

TRAVIS: Everything's wrong, okay?

3197
01:56:20.593 --> 01:56:22.689
BRIAN: So something bad definitely happened.

3198
01:56:22.689 --> 01:56:25.755
The military was brought in, they were taken over

3199
01:56:25.755 --> 01:56:26.588

01:56:32.188 --> 01:56:33.397
TRAVIS: I will fight Jerry.

3202
01:56:33.397 --> 01:56:35.515
BRIAN: If you guys are fucking actually planning

3203
01:56:35.515 --> 01:56:39.495
to make shit in real life fall on my fucking face,

3204
01:56:39.495 --> 01:56:41.962
I'm going to kill someone, and then you're fired

3205
01:56:41.962 --> 01:56:43.119
after you're dead.

3206
01:56:43.119 --> 01:56:44.281
TRAVIS: Jerry, you better claim that that was you,

3207
01:56:44.281 --> 01:56:46.875
because if it's some spiritual shit, I will bamf

3208
01:56:46.875 --> 01:56:48.993
out of this realm so fast.

3209
01:56:48.993 --> 01:56:50.090
BRIAN: What just fell down?

3210
01:56:50.090 --> 01:56:51.225
TRAVIS: Don't fuck around!

3211
01:56:51.225 --> 01:56:52.957
BRIAN: I'm just looking to see what fell over, dude,

3212
01:56:52.957 --> 01:56:55.418
I'm fucking terrified.

3213
01:56:55.418 --> 01:56:57.397
TRAVIS: What is happening right now?

3214
01:56:57.397 --> 01:56:59.293
BRIAN: They're watching the Game of Thrones finale.

3215
01:56:59.293 --> 01:57:01.162
This guy's like, "Are you fucking serious?"

3216
01:57:01.162 --> 01:57:02.458
TRAVIS: I feel like we're in Sleep No More.

3217
01:57:02.458 --> 01:57:06.235
BRIAN: This guy's like, "I lost half my face for this?"

3218
01:57:06.235 --> 01:57:08.892
The other guy's like, "I can't look, man."

3219
01:57:08.892 --> 01:57:12.206
TRAVIS: All right, guys, it's been real, appreciate ya.

3220
01:57:12.206 --> 01:57:13.331
BRIAN: TV's on the fuzz.

Rip them clean!

TRAVIS: Oh god, I keep thinking I see things.

3232
01:57:32.186 --> 01:57:33.495
BRIAN: I don't like this one bit.

3233
01:57:33.495 --> 01:57:34.380
TRAVIS: We're good, we're good, we're good.

3234
01:57:34.380 --> 01:57:35.440
BRIAN: The fact that--

TRAVIS: Do I need to head under the bed?

3241
01:57:45.885 --> 01:57:46.718
What do I do?!

3242
01:57:46.718 --> 01:57:47.551
BRIAN: Back under the bed?

3243
01:57:47.551 --> 01:57:48.506
I don't know, man.

He's faster than shit!

Go back, go back.

I'm a fan of emotes by Arsequeef. They're neat.

3261
01:59:11.426 --> 01:59:15.445
I'm a fan of a wife so cool, people forget I exist.

3262
01:59:15.445 --> 01:59:16.528
Exist, exist.

3263
01:59:17.392 --> 01:59:19.838
(bird cawing)

3264
01:59:19.838 --> 01:59:21.435
(heart thumping)

3265
01:59:21.435 --> 01:59:22.930
(explosion)

3266
01:59:22.930 --> 01:59:26.463
(robotic buzzing)

3267
01:59:30.477 --> 01:59:33.720
(heavy breathing)

3268
01:59:33.720 --> 01:59:37.103
(baby crying)

3269
01:59:41.892 --> 01:59:46.251
I'm a fan of wearing your skin as a mask.

3270
01:59:50.339 --> 01:59:55.098
("Spring" by Antonio Vivaldi)

3271
02:00:05.298 --> 02:00:08.131
(dramatic music)

3272
02:13:59.962 --> 02:14:01.913
MATT: And welcome back.

3273
02:14:01.913 --> 02:14:05.191
Before we jump into the latter half of the session,

3274
02:14:05.191 --> 02:14:08.776
we have our giveaway winner, which is Sperlman19.

3275
02:14:08.776 --> 02:14:10.296
Sperlman19, congratulations.

3276
02:14:10.296 --> 02:14:12.259
We'll go ahead and get this sent to you ASAP

3277
02:14:12.259 --> 02:14:16.912
and enjoy the special edition Wyrmwood coffin case.

3278
02:14:16.912 --> 02:14:17.810
Awesome.

3279
02:14:17.810 --> 02:14:22.805
SAM: Guys, over the break, I got a text from Andy Serkis.

3280
02:14:22.805 --> 02:14:23.900
I'm in.

3281
02:14:23.900 --> 02:14:25.041
LAURA: Sweet, good job.

3282
02:14:25.041 --> 02:14:27.411
SAM: I'm Planet of the Apes part four.

3283
02:14:27.411 --> 02:14:28.272
MATT: Congratulations.

3284
02:14:28.272 --> 02:14:29.115
LAURA: I'm so proud of you.

3285
02:14:29.115 --> 02:14:30.010
SAM: It's about me.

3286
02:14:30.010 --> 02:14:30.843
TALIESIN: Eight parter?

3287
02:14:30.843 --> 02:14:32.599
SAM: It's just me.
MATT: Eight parter.

3288
02:14:32.599 --> 02:14:33.432
LAURA: Just you.

3289
02:14:33.432 --> 02:14:34.265
SAM: Yeah, it's just me.

3290
02:14:34.265 --> 02:14:35.098
MATT: It's what we've all wanted.

3291
02:14:35.098 --> 02:14:37.657
SAM: It's me and Andy Serkis in a video,

3292
02:14:37.657 --> 02:14:40.027
like a cam corder, for two hours.

3293
02:14:40.027 --> 02:14:41.998
TALIESIN: It isn't just the remake of Smokey and the Bandit

3294
02:14:41.998 --> 02:14:43.361
that will inevitably be coming?

3295
02:14:43.361 --> 02:14:44.800
SAM: Yes.

3296
02:14:44.800 --> 02:14:46.693
MATT: Every Which Way But Loose,
but you play the orangutan?

3297
02:14:46.693 --> 02:14:47.761
SAM: (laughs)

3298
02:14:47.761 --> 02:14:49.320
MATT: Anyway.

3299
02:14:50.245 --> 02:14:54.720
As you guys step into this dark red,

3300
02:14:56.384 --> 02:15:00.209
flesh-lorded chamber with the Permaheart

3301
02:15:00.209 --> 02:15:04.336
sitting in the center, runic symbols placed around

3302
02:15:04.336 --> 02:15:08.928
the containment glass that seems to have held most of it

3303
02:15:08.928 --> 02:15:11.286
until it's begun to spill out and take the chamber

3304
02:15:11.286 --> 02:15:12.475
for itself.

3305
02:15:12.475 --> 02:15:14.402
Chains that were once affixed to the glass

3306
02:15:14.402 --> 02:15:17.916
now broken and now lie loose across the ground.

3307
02:15:17.916 --> 02:15:19.303
I'm going to go ahead and get the battlefield.

3308
02:15:19.303 --> 02:15:22.087
TRAVIS: Oh my god, okay.

3309
02:15:24.979 --> 02:15:29.637
SAM: This cardiac arrest brought to you by dwarvenforge.com.

3310
02:15:30.549 --> 02:15:33.190
Get ready for Halloween with Dwarven Forge's

3311
02:15:33.190 --> 02:15:35.424
classic resin restock.

3312
02:15:35.424 --> 02:15:37.175
I already said this earlier today.

3313
02:15:37.175 --> 02:15:38.759
Check it out, dwarvenforge.com.

3314
02:15:38.759 --> 02:15:41.022
LAURA: Oh god!
TALIESIN: Oh no!

3315
02:15:41.022 --> 02:15:42.914
(shouting)

3316
02:15:42.914 --> 02:15:45.217
SAM: That's a floor of blood.

3317
02:15:45.217 --> 02:15:47.982
That is a floor of blood.
MARISHA: Oh jeez.

3318
02:15:47.982 --> 02:15:49.445
TRAVIS: Look at the symbols on it.

3319
02:15:49.445 --> 02:15:52.474
LAURA: Ooh, what do we do with the symbols?

3320
02:15:52.474 --> 02:15:54.552
What are we supposed to do with the symbols!

3321
02:15:54.552 --> 02:15:55.613
SAM: What symbols, where?

3322
02:15:55.613 --> 02:15:57.328
MATT: On the jar.
LAURA: Over the jar!

3323
02:15:57.328 --> 02:15:58.670
TRAVIS: So it is on the surface,

3324
02:15:58.670 --> 02:15:59.514
it's not floating.
SAM: Those were just on the jar

3325
02:15:59.514 --> 02:16:01.688
that he found in his house when he built this.

3326
02:16:01.688 --> 02:16:04.652
LIAM: That means raspberry, boysenberry--

3327
02:16:04.652 --> 02:16:06.397
MARISHA: What are these things?

3328
02:16:06.397 --> 02:16:09.792
TRAVIS: Some of the chains that were holding it, right?

3329
02:16:09.792 --> 02:16:11.354
MARISHA: Oh, right, there's chains.

3330
02:16:11.354 --> 02:16:13.595
TALIESIN: But there's weird little stones.
MARISHA: But there's symbols.

3331
02:16:13.595 --> 02:16:16.244
There's plaques. Do you see them?

3332
02:16:16.244 --> 02:16:19.867
SAM: Are those real chains or are those supposed
to be gross tendrils?

3333
02:16:19.867 --> 02:16:21.171
LAURA and TALIESIN: Those are real chains.

3334
02:16:21.171 --> 02:16:23.209
TRAVIS: I think the tendrils are all over the floor.

3335
02:16:23.209 --> 02:16:25.268
LIAM: Caleb is eyeballing every symbol in here.

3336
02:16:25.268 --> 02:16:27.544
MATT: You see elements of heavy veins and flesh that have

3337
02:16:27.544 --> 02:16:29.686
rooted themselves into the stone

3338
02:16:29.686 --> 02:16:31.506
in the center of the chamber around it.

3339
02:16:31.506 --> 02:16:34.087
You do see some faint glowing glyphs

3340
02:16:34.087 --> 02:16:35.944
at each corner of the chamber.

3341
02:16:35.944 --> 02:16:38.925
However, I need you guys all to roll initiative.

3342
02:16:38.925 --> 02:16:39.938
(groaning)

3343
02:16:39.938 --> 02:16:41.599
LAURA: What, already?

3344
02:16:41.599 --> 02:16:44.099
TRAVIS: Oh god, oh god, oh no.

3345
02:16:47.581 --> 02:16:49.431
TALIESIN: Hey!

3346
02:16:49.431 --> 02:16:51.825
MARISHA: I'm going to use my boots.

3347
02:16:51.825 --> 02:16:53.137
It's a good time.

3348
02:16:53.137 --> 02:16:54.505
Fuck!
TRAVIS: Terrible.

3349
02:16:54.505 --> 02:16:56.871
MARISHA: I've got my boots.
LAURA: Does she have Boots of Haste?

3350
02:16:56.871 --> 02:16:57.912
LIAM: No, add to her initiative.

3351
02:16:57.912 --> 02:17:00.250
MARISHA: My initiative's shit. It's terrible.

3352
02:17:00.250 --> 02:17:01.083
TRAVIS: So bad.

3353
02:17:01.083 --> 02:17:03.920
MATT: So 25 to 20?

3354
02:17:03.920 --> 02:17:05.069
LAURA: Oh, 24.

3355
02:17:05.069 --> 02:17:07.306
MATT: 24, Jester.
SAM: Nice.

3356
02:17:07.306 --> 02:17:09.117
LAURA: What am I going to do first?

3357
02:17:09.117 --> 02:17:10.976
What am I going to do here?

3358
02:17:10.976 --> 02:17:12.599
MATT: 20 to 15?

3359
02:17:12.599 --> 02:17:14.045
TALIESIN: 18.

3360
02:17:14.045 --> 02:17:14.878
MARISHA: 16.

3361
02:17:16.375 --> 02:17:17.362
SAM: 17.

3362
02:17:17.362 --> 02:17:19.209
MARISHA: Jester and Cad, the clerics are first.

3363
02:17:19.209 --> 02:17:20.875
MATT: You're before-- wait.

3364
02:17:20.875 --> 02:17:21.708
MARISHA: Beau.

3365
02:17:21.708 --> 02:17:22.648
SAM: She had a 22.

3366
02:17:22.648 --> 02:17:24.493
MATT: You're 22--
LAURA: Oh, 22, yes.

3367
02:17:24.493 --> 02:17:25.559
MATT: 17?
SAM: 17.

3368
02:17:25.559 --> 02:17:27.646
TRAVIS: Caduceus, Nott, Beau.

3369
02:17:27.646 --> 02:17:29.616
MARISHA: Oh.
MATT: Yeah, Nott, Beau.

3370
02:17:29.616 --> 02:17:30.851
LIAM: Not Beau.

3371
02:17:30.851 --> 02:17:31.934
MATT: 10 to five.

3372
02:17:32.783 --> 02:17:36.265
LIAM: Oh, 14, sorry, I was somewhere else.

3373
02:17:36.265 --> 02:17:37.112
Apologies.

3374
02:17:37.112 --> 02:17:38.310
TRAVIS: Two.

3375
02:17:38.310 --> 02:17:39.144
LAURA: Ooh.

3376
02:17:39.144 --> 02:17:40.833
MATT: Hold on.

3377
02:17:40.833 --> 02:17:42.010
MARISHA: Wait, what?

3378
02:17:42.010 --> 02:17:44.531
LAURA: So Caleb is still after Beau?
MARISHA: Is your initiative zero?

3379
02:17:44.531 --> 02:17:48.908
TRAVIS: Yep. Just rolled a big fat two.

3380
02:17:48.908 --> 02:17:51.188
MATT: Jester, you're up first.

3381
02:17:51.188 --> 02:17:52.881
SAM: We're in combat?

3382
02:17:52.881 --> 02:17:54.100
TRAVIS: We're in an initiative round.

3383
02:17:54.100 --> 02:17:55.829
MATT: We're in initiative order.

3384
02:17:55.829 --> 02:17:56.718
SAM: Okay.

3385
02:17:56.718 --> 02:17:59.052
LAURA: Do we feel painful?

3386
02:17:59.052 --> 02:18:00.346
Does anything--

3387
02:18:00.346 --> 02:18:01.968
MATT: As soon as you enter the chamber,

3388
02:18:01.968 --> 02:18:04.479
like walking into a room where the temperature

3389
02:18:04.479 --> 02:18:06.282
is 40 degrees more than it is,

3390
02:18:06.282 --> 02:18:08.451
there's an immediate

3391
02:18:08.451 --> 02:18:10.670
nauseous pulse that hits you with each beat of the heart,

3392
02:18:10.670 --> 02:18:12.826
like (thumping).

3393
02:18:12.826 --> 02:18:15.284
LAURA: It's like the brown note.

3394
02:18:15.284 --> 02:18:19.601
MATT: It's hard to explain, but what are you doing?

3395
02:18:19.601 --> 02:18:21.934
(chuckling)

3396
02:18:23.996 --> 02:18:26.380
SAM: Are we not supposed to kill this thing?

3397
02:18:26.380 --> 02:18:27.730
TRAVIS: We are supposed to kill this thing.

3398
02:18:27.730 --> 02:18:29.513
SAM: If we kill it, does the Laughing Hand die?

3399
02:18:29.513 --> 02:18:30.969
TRAVIS: He becomes killable.

3400
02:18:30.969 --> 02:18:32.321
SAM: Ah.

3401
02:18:32.321 --> 02:18:33.154
MARISHA: Yeah.

3402
02:18:33.154 --> 02:18:34.450
TRAVIS: Much like the troll, right?

3403
02:18:34.450 --> 02:18:36.653
If we can kill this heart, then he won't regenerate,

3404
02:18:36.653 --> 02:18:39.335
I think like the other troll.

3405
02:18:39.335 --> 02:18:41.491
LAURA: How far out do the tendrils go from the heart?

3406
02:18:41.491 --> 02:18:43.087
Does it all over the floor in the room, or--

3407
02:18:43.087 --> 02:18:45.580
MATT: They're thicker on the edge, but some of them

3408
02:18:45.580 --> 02:18:47.314
like spill out into the edges.

3409
02:18:47.314 --> 02:18:49.797
It's rooted itself in the entire chamber to some degree.

3410
02:18:49.797 --> 02:18:52.227
TALIESIN: There's three weird glowing things in
each corner.

3411
02:18:52.227 --> 02:18:53.060
MATT: Correct.

3412
02:18:53.060 --> 02:18:55.277
TALIESIN: Okay, there's a glowing thing in each corner.

3413
02:18:55.277 --> 02:18:57.454
Okay, there's a glowing thing in each corner.

3414
02:18:57.454 --> 02:18:58.287
MATT: So Jester, what are you doing?

3415
02:18:58.287 --> 02:19:01.253
Caduceus, you're up next.
LAURA: I'm going to use my action

3416
02:19:01.253 --> 02:19:02.660
to cast--

3417
02:19:02.660 --> 02:19:05.021
I'm going to try to cast Divine Intervention.

3418
02:19:05.021 --> 02:19:06.379
MATT: Okay.

3419
02:19:06.379 --> 02:19:07.266
TRAVIS: Wow.

3420
02:19:07.266 --> 02:19:08.950
LAURA: I'm going to try to ask the Traveler to help us

3421
02:19:08.950 --> 02:19:12.050
figure out what to do with this heart.

3422
02:19:12.050 --> 02:19:15.223
MATT: Okay, roll percentile dice for me, please.

3423
02:19:15.223 --> 02:19:17.127
TRAVIS: Come on.
LIAM: Do the impossible.

3424
02:19:17.127 --> 02:19:19.129
MARISHA: I know, it'll be magical!

3425
02:19:19.129 --> 02:19:20.913
TRAVIS: It's a good call, coming out the gate.

3426
02:19:20.913 --> 02:19:23.850
Hail Mary. First and ten. Here we go.
MARISHA: Good dice night!

3427
02:19:23.850 --> 02:19:25.718
LAURA: Nah, 32.

3428
02:19:25.718 --> 02:19:27.977
MATT: You reach out, but unfortunately, as you speak

3429
02:19:27.977 --> 02:19:30.288
towards the Traveler to look upon you,

3430
02:19:30.288 --> 02:19:34.071
the folded element of this chamber

3431
02:19:34.071 --> 02:19:35.875
is so deeply embedded

3432
02:19:35.875 --> 02:19:38.620
into the private network of the tower's

3433
02:19:38.620 --> 02:19:41.089
various change chambers, that the Traveler

3434
02:19:41.089 --> 02:19:42.635
cannot hear your call.

3435
02:19:42.635 --> 02:19:43.468
LAURA: Okay.

3436
02:19:43.468 --> 02:19:45.566
Oh no, that makes me feel really uncomfortable

3437
02:19:45.566 --> 02:19:47.802
that he cannot hear me right now.

3438
02:19:47.802 --> 02:19:48.947
MATT: You still have your movement.

3439
02:19:48.947 --> 02:19:51.615
LAURA: I'm going to move over to my left

3440
02:19:51.615 --> 02:19:54.970
and avoid stepping on any of the tendrils.

3441
02:19:54.970 --> 02:19:57.395
I'm going to gingerly step over them

3442
02:19:57.395 --> 02:19:58.960
and get about there.
MATT: That's your movement there.

3443
02:19:58.960 --> 02:20:01.205
LAURA: Okay, that's all.
MATT: Bonus action? You good?

3444
02:20:01.205 --> 02:20:04.910
LAURA: My bonus action, I'm just going to--

3445
02:20:04.910 --> 02:20:08.651
I'm going to bring up my

3446
02:20:08.651 --> 02:20:10.832
Spiritual Weapon.

3447
02:20:10.832 --> 02:20:13.171
MATT: Okay, what level?

3448
02:20:13.171 --> 02:20:16.068
LAURA: At 4th-level.

3449
02:20:16.068 --> 02:20:17.827
MATT: 4th-level, you got it.

3450
02:20:17.827 --> 02:20:20.527
Where do you want to place it?

3451
02:20:20.527 --> 02:20:24.408
LAURA: In front of the big group of everyone.

3452
02:20:24.408 --> 02:20:25.399
MATT: Right here?
LAURA: Yeah.

3453
02:20:25.399 --> 02:20:26.232
MATT: Okay.

3454
02:20:26.232 --> 02:20:28.192
TRAVIS: Do the pillars go all the way to the ceiling?

3455
02:20:28.192 --> 02:20:29.350
MATT: They do.

3456
02:20:29.350 --> 02:20:31.935
The ceiling is about 15 feet tall.

3457
02:20:31.935 --> 02:20:33.229
It's not extremely high.

3458
02:20:33.229 --> 02:20:36.229
LAURA: Like where Beau is, floating above her head,

3459
02:20:36.229 --> 02:20:38.065
so that she doesn't, yeah.

3460
02:20:38.065 --> 02:20:40.422
MATT: Okay, around there. You got it.

3461
02:20:40.422 --> 02:20:43.582
All right, that finishes Jester's turn. Caduceus, you're up.

3462
02:20:43.582 --> 02:20:45.215
TALIESIN: I'm going to--

3463
02:20:48.187 --> 02:20:50.916
I'm going to quickly cast Bless.

3464
02:20:50.916 --> 02:20:52.292
MATT: Okay, on?

3465
02:20:54.970 --> 02:20:56.569
TALIESIN: Fjord,

3466
02:20:58.996 --> 02:21:01.570
Beau, and Nott.

3467
02:21:01.570 --> 02:21:04.450
TRAVIS: Bless you, sir.

3468
02:21:04.450 --> 02:21:05.644
SAM: What does that mean again?

3469
02:21:05.644 --> 02:21:06.807
We get plus four to everything?

3470
02:21:06.807 --> 02:21:08.411
LAURA: To your attack rolls and--

3471
02:21:08.411 --> 02:21:11.085
TALIESIN: For attacks and saves.

3472
02:21:11.085 --> 02:21:13.038
SAM: Cool.

3473
02:21:13.038 --> 02:21:17.092
TALIESIN: And I'm just-- Yeah, I'm going to

3474
02:21:17.092 --> 02:21:19.200
stay right where I am for now.

3475
02:21:19.200 --> 02:21:20.990
MATT: You got it. Finishes Caduceus' go.

3476
02:21:20.990 --> 02:21:22.666
Nott, you're up.

3477
02:21:22.666 --> 02:21:25.423
SAM: I will clock to my right.

3478
02:21:25.423 --> 02:21:26.716
MATT: Okay.

3479
02:21:26.716 --> 02:21:30.619
SAM: Maybe over by that pillar, if I can get that far.

3480
02:21:30.619 --> 02:21:32.821
MATT: Yeah, 30 feet, you still have five feet of
movement, I believe.

3481
02:21:32.821 --> 02:21:35.323
SAM: I can't hide from this thing, it's got senses.

3482
02:21:35.323 --> 02:21:37.078
It can feel everything, right?

3483
02:21:37.078 --> 02:21:38.673
It's got tremorsense or something.

3484
02:21:38.673 --> 02:21:40.049
TRAVIS: Certainly seems like it.

3485
02:21:40.049 --> 02:21:42.735
SAM: So I'm not going to bother hiding.

3486
02:21:42.735 --> 02:21:46.545
I'll cast Mage Hand.

3487
02:21:46.545 --> 02:21:47.386
MATT: Okay.

3488
02:21:47.386 --> 02:21:49.815
SAM: Just to have it up in case.

3489
02:21:49.815 --> 02:21:51.335
MATT: Just to have it floating around.

3490
02:21:51.335 --> 02:21:53.189
Let me find a Mage Hand.

3491
02:21:53.189 --> 02:21:55.023
Where do you want to cast it?

3492
02:21:55.023 --> 02:21:58.115
SAM: 30 feet towards the thing.

3493
02:21:58.115 --> 02:21:59.436
MATT: All righty.

3494
02:21:59.436 --> 02:22:01.087
I have it about right there.

3495
02:22:01.087 --> 02:22:02.996
SAM: Great.
MATT: There's your Mage Hand.

3496
02:22:02.996 --> 02:22:05.969
Nott's turn's over, Beauregard.

3497
02:22:05.969 --> 02:22:08.732
MARISHA: I look at Caleb.
TRAVIS: Terrible.

3498
02:22:08.732 --> 02:22:09.960
I know something's coming.

3499
02:22:09.960 --> 02:22:11.623
LAURA: Yeah, something terrible's going to happen.

3500
02:22:11.623 --> 02:22:13.388
TRAVIS: It's that part in the horror movie.

3501
02:22:13.388 --> 02:22:14.940
MARISHA: You going to look at these runes?

3502
02:22:14.940 --> 02:22:18.658
TALIESIN: That was a good call,
I was debating on that, too.

3503
02:22:18.658 --> 02:22:20.274
MARISHA: You can shout some out to me, I'll look at these,

3504
02:22:20.274 --> 02:22:21.448
see if any of them match.

3505
02:22:21.448 --> 02:22:23.989
SAM: Actually, Matt, can I put it 15 feet away from me?

3506
02:22:23.989 --> 02:22:25.698
MATT: Sure.

3507
02:22:25.698 --> 02:22:28.771
MARISHA: There's these slabs over here.

3508
02:22:28.771 --> 02:22:29.796
LIAM: Hmm.

3509
02:22:31.026 --> 02:22:32.131
MARISHA: I don't know, okay.

3510
02:22:32.131 --> 02:22:33.314
I'm going to come over here and

3511
02:22:33.314 --> 02:22:35.155
I'm going to look at this tablet.

3512
02:22:37.198 --> 02:22:41.972
MATT: (counting) 45.

3513
02:22:42.956 --> 02:22:46.055
You're not quite close enough to get a full pass on it.

3514
02:22:46.055 --> 02:22:46.888
MARISHA: 50.

3515
02:22:46.888 --> 02:22:48.521
MATT: Oh, is it 50? It went up.

3516
02:22:48.521 --> 02:22:50.563
Right, so yeah, you can get right up to it.

3517
02:22:50.563 --> 02:22:54.146
Now you have the glyph, and this is a...

3518
02:22:55.836 --> 02:22:58.011
The glyph itself is very intricate.

3519
02:22:58.011 --> 02:22:59.828
You can see it's symbols upon symbols,

3520
02:22:59.828 --> 02:23:01.948
and there is some sort of an equation and pattern

3521
02:23:01.948 --> 02:23:03.270
to its construction.

3522
02:23:03.270 --> 02:23:05.500
If you would like to make an investigation check

3523
02:23:05.500 --> 02:23:08.796
as your action to attempt to discern it.

3524
02:23:08.796 --> 02:23:10.696
LAURA: Guidance.

3525
02:23:10.696 --> 02:23:14.007
Oh wait, she's not close enough, I can't touch her.

3526
02:23:14.007 --> 02:23:15.220
MATT: No, you can't touch her.

3527
02:23:15.220 --> 02:23:17.163
But you are blessed, but Bless is only attacks

3528
02:23:17.163 --> 02:23:18.649
and saving throws, that's right.

3529
02:23:18.649 --> 02:23:19.840
Go for it.

3530
02:23:19.840 --> 02:23:23.673
MARISHA: Doing me good, okay, you been doing me good!

3531
02:23:25.120 --> 02:23:25.956
25.

3532
02:23:25.956 --> 02:23:27.422
MATT: 25.
MARISHA: Yeah.

3533
02:23:27.422 --> 02:23:29.979
TALIESIN: Smartest kid in the room.

3534
02:23:29.979 --> 02:23:31.439
MARISHA: Rolled a 17.

3535
02:23:31.439 --> 02:23:36.179
MATT: As you look at this glyph, with your new headband

3536
02:23:36.179 --> 02:23:38.744
you've acquired now woven into your hair--

3537
02:23:38.744 --> 02:23:39.919
LAURA: Looking real pretty.

3538
02:23:39.919 --> 02:23:41.873
MATT: While you do not have

3539
02:23:41.873 --> 02:23:44.034
a deep knowledge of the arcane,

3540
02:23:44.034 --> 02:23:47.778
your pattern recognition is extremely intense.

3541
02:23:47.778 --> 02:23:49.531
You begin to see where all these different equations

3542
02:23:49.531 --> 02:23:50.429
begin to match up.

3543
02:23:50.429 --> 02:23:51.534
While you do not understand the nature

3544
02:23:51.534 --> 02:23:55.001
of the magic specifically, you begin to

3545
02:23:55.001 --> 02:23:58.722
take out your staff and find one little spot

3546
02:23:58.722 --> 02:24:02.308
where it looks like the equation is weakest,

3547
02:24:02.308 --> 02:24:05.558
and you take your staff and then whack, whack,

3548
02:24:05.558 --> 02:24:07.399
and then crack the stone where it is,

3549
02:24:07.399 --> 02:24:10.999
just chip it a little bit, and as it does, goes dark.

3550
02:24:10.999 --> 02:24:13.848
You watch as the center glass chamber

3551
02:24:13.848 --> 02:24:16.790
around the heart cracks slightly.

3552
02:24:17.898 --> 02:24:20.118
TALIESIN: We all saw that.
SAM: Is that good or bad?

3553
02:24:20.118 --> 02:24:22.101
LAURA: It's got to be good. We have to be able to hit
it, right?

3554
02:24:22.101 --> 02:24:23.385
TALIESIN: Yeah, we can't do damage until--

3555
02:24:23.385 --> 02:24:25.819
TRAVIS: Yeah, but it's on once it's out, so--

3556
02:24:25.819 --> 02:24:27.256
TALIESIN: It's probably going to be on before it's out,

3557
02:24:27.256 --> 02:24:28.989
it's just we can't hurt it till it's out.

3558
02:24:28.989 --> 02:24:30.540
MATT: Bonus action, anything?

3559
02:24:30.540 --> 02:24:34.696
MARISHA: Uh! The glyphs.

3560
02:24:34.696 --> 02:24:39.333
Think if we break the glyphs, we break the jar.

3561
02:24:39.333 --> 02:24:40.842
SAM: Save the cheerleader?

3562
02:24:40.842 --> 02:24:42.198
MARISHA: Save the cheerleader.

3563
02:24:42.198 --> 02:24:43.659
LAURA: Save the world.

3564
02:24:43.659 --> 02:24:44.906
MARISHA: Queen of prom.

3565
02:24:44.906 --> 02:24:47.499
TALIESIN: You just monked this, but the other Monk,

3566
02:24:47.499 --> 02:24:51.512
who used the TV Monk to monk this.
MATT: Save the cheerleader, end of season one.

3567
02:24:51.512 --> 02:24:53.071
TALIESIN: You can do both monks now.

3568
02:24:53.071 --> 02:24:54.029
MARISHA: I should.

3569
02:24:54.029 --> 02:24:55.679
MATT: All right. That finish your turn?

3570
02:24:56.798 --> 02:24:58.645
MARISHA: Yes.
MATT: All right.

3571
02:24:58.645 --> 02:25:01.352
Now it is Caleb's turn, Caleb.

3572
02:25:01.352 --> 02:25:03.225
LIAM: I look over at the one on the other side

3573
02:25:03.225 --> 02:25:06.804
and hold my hand out and cast Dispel Magic on it.

3574
02:25:06.804 --> 02:25:09.340
MATT: Cast Dispel Magic on the glyph across the way?

3575
02:25:09.340 --> 02:25:10.401
LIAM: That corner.

3576
02:25:10.401 --> 02:25:12.002
MATT: Over there? Okay.

3577
02:25:12.002 --> 02:25:15.728
Go ahead and make an intelligence check.

3578
02:25:17.520 --> 02:25:18.353
LIAM: (sighs)

3579
02:25:18.353 --> 02:25:19.568
16.

3580
02:25:19.568 --> 02:25:21.089
MATT: 16?

3581
02:25:21.089 --> 02:25:25.622
The spell releases, but the glyph holds strong.

3582
02:25:30.614 --> 02:25:31.919
LIAM: Well, that's it.

3583
02:25:31.919 --> 02:25:33.831
LAURA: Just hit it, Caleb! That's what Beau did,

3584
02:25:33.831 --> 02:25:35.673
just hit it a lot!

3585
02:25:35.673 --> 02:25:40.340
LIAM: I don't think I should just hit anything in this room.

3586
02:25:42.228 --> 02:25:43.512
That's the end of my turn.

3587
02:25:43.512 --> 02:25:45.411
MATT: Okay, that finishes your go, are you going to send

3588
02:25:45.411 --> 02:25:46.621
your guy anywhere?
LIAM: No.

3589
02:25:46.621 --> 02:25:47.498
MATT: Okay.

3590
02:25:47.498 --> 02:25:49.047
LIAM: Defend me if anything comes close.

3591
02:25:49.047 --> 02:25:51.475
MATT: Okay. It is now the Permaheart's turn.

3592
02:25:51.475 --> 02:25:53.707
(groaning)

3593
02:25:53.707 --> 02:25:57.446
The aura gets more intense as the rhythmic beat

3594
02:25:57.446 --> 02:26:00.040
suddenly pulses, and you can feel

3595
02:26:00.040 --> 02:26:04.579
this wave of necrotic energy slam into your body.

3596
02:26:04.579 --> 02:26:07.079
Everybody in the room takes...

3597
02:26:10.364 --> 02:26:12.089
SAM: We just take.
MATT: You just take.

3598
02:26:12.089 --> 02:26:13.214
SAM: We don't roll.
MATT: Nope.

3599
02:26:13.214 --> 02:26:14.755
MARISHA: Just take.
LAURA: Oh, see--

3600
02:26:14.755 --> 02:26:16.754
MATT: Seven points of necrotic damage.

3601
02:26:16.754 --> 02:26:18.228
LAURA: Oh fuck.

3602
02:26:19.981 --> 02:26:24.981
MATT: It's now going to go ahead and use Summon Tendrils.

3603
02:26:25.387 --> 02:26:27.043
LAURA: Of course it is.
SAM: Summon Tendrils.

3604
02:26:27.043 --> 02:26:28.793
TRAVIS: It doesn't have to.

3605
02:26:31.156 --> 02:26:33.026
MATT: Well at the start of its turn, one of its

3606
02:26:33.026 --> 02:26:36.560
protective tendrils appears anywhere within 30 feet of it.

3607
02:26:37.902 --> 02:26:39.665
SAM: Ew.

3608
02:26:39.665 --> 02:26:42.451
TRAVIS: Oh, it's like that.
LAURA: Ew.

3609
02:26:42.451 --> 02:26:44.405
MATT: Then Summon Tendrils, it's going to summon two more.

3610
02:26:44.405 --> 02:26:46.681
LIAM: Is there something on this side that I can't see?

3611
02:26:46.681 --> 02:26:47.708
TRAVIS: There's one more glyph.

3612
02:26:47.708 --> 02:26:49.570
LIAM: Another glyph right there?
SAM: Oh no.

3613
02:26:49.570 --> 02:26:50.913
There's a spaghetti next to me.

3614
02:26:50.913 --> 02:26:52.597
LAURA: No!

3615
02:26:52.597 --> 02:26:55.581
MATT: Now you watch as these fleshy tendrils

3616
02:26:55.581 --> 02:26:58.220
that were rooted into the ground suddenly tear loose,

3617
02:26:58.220 --> 02:27:02.834
rise up, and begin to swirl and writhe in the air,

3618
02:27:02.834 --> 02:27:05.213
almost like they have a mind of their own,

3619
02:27:05.213 --> 02:27:06.785
but they all seem to move in unison almost,

3620
02:27:06.785 --> 02:27:10.040
before breaking away into different actions.

3621
02:27:10.040 --> 02:27:14.495
One of them is going to attempt to lash at you, Fjord.

3622
02:27:14.495 --> 02:27:15.328
TRAVIS: Okay.

3623
02:27:16.346 --> 02:27:18.392
MATT: That's going to be a 20 to hit?

3624
02:27:18.392 --> 02:27:19.394
TRAVIS: That definitely hits.

3625
02:27:19.394 --> 02:27:21.352
MATT: All right, you take...

3626
02:27:21.352 --> 02:27:24.214
oof, 15 points of bludgeoning damage,

3627
02:27:24.214 --> 02:27:27.693
and you have to make a strength saving throw.

3628
02:27:27.693 --> 02:27:28.651
TALIESIN: With a d4.

3629
02:27:28.651 --> 02:27:30.568
TRAVIS: With a d4, thank you.

3630
02:27:35.345 --> 02:27:36.595
It's not great.

3631
02:27:40.692 --> 02:27:41.717
15.

3632
02:27:41.717 --> 02:27:43.652
MATT: 15, that's just what you needed.

3633
02:27:43.652 --> 02:27:44.485
LAURA: Oh!

3634
02:27:44.485 --> 02:27:46.644
MATT: As it lashes and begins to wrap around you,

3635
02:27:46.644 --> 02:27:48.755
you actually reach and yank it and throw it off

3636
02:27:48.755 --> 02:27:50.607
of your body. It does not manage to grapple you.

3637
02:27:50.607 --> 02:27:52.186
LAURA: Oh god.

3638
02:27:52.186 --> 02:27:54.014
MATT: One of them attempts to lash you, Nott.

3639
02:27:54.014 --> 02:27:55.231
SAM: (shouts)

3640
02:27:55.231 --> 02:27:57.806
That's going to be a 26 to hit?

3641
02:27:57.806 --> 02:27:59.218
SAM: It hits.

3642
02:27:59.218 --> 02:28:02.020
MATT: You take 13 points of bludgeoning damage,

3643
02:28:02.020 --> 02:28:03.531
and I need you to make a strength saving throw.

3644
02:28:03.531 --> 02:28:05.260
SAM: Can I Uncanny Dodge that?

3645
02:28:05.260 --> 02:28:07.716
MATT: Sure.
SAM: So that's six?

3646
02:28:07.716 --> 02:28:11.202
LAURA: We got to get it out of the jar so we can burn it.

3647
02:28:12.669 --> 02:28:14.844
SAM: This is a dex save? What is this?

3648
02:28:14.844 --> 02:28:15.929
MATT: This is a strength saving throw.

3649
02:28:15.929 --> 02:28:17.762
SAM: Strength save? That's not as good.

3650
02:28:17.762 --> 02:28:20.524
TALIESIN: With a d4.
SAM: Yeah, that's not going to work.

3651
02:28:20.524 --> 02:28:21.515
12.

3652
02:28:21.515 --> 02:28:22.729
MATT: 12, you are grappled.

3653
02:28:22.729 --> 02:28:23.841
SAM: Oh no!

3654
02:28:23.841 --> 02:28:25.339
MATT: Still do everything else, you can use an action

3655
02:28:25.339 --> 02:28:28.209
to break free, but currently your movement is zero.

3656
02:28:29.101 --> 02:28:31.516
And against you, Jester.

3657
02:28:31.516 --> 02:28:33.340
That is going to be a...

3658
02:28:33.340 --> 02:28:34.882
20 to hit?

3659
02:28:34.882 --> 02:28:36.590
Does that hit you? Okay.

3660
02:28:36.590 --> 02:28:39.033
You take seven points of bludgeoning damage

3661
02:28:39.033 --> 02:28:42.137
and you need to make a strength saving throw.

3662
02:28:42.137 --> 02:28:43.804
MARISHA: Come on, beefcake.

3663
02:28:45.909 --> 02:28:47.718
LAURA: Okay, that's a 17.

3664
02:28:47.718 --> 02:28:48.704
MATT: 17.

3665
02:28:48.704 --> 02:28:51.161
It slashes towards you, it hits you across the shoulder

3666
02:28:51.161 --> 02:28:53.040
and the chin, and as it tries to wrap around,

3667
02:28:53.040 --> 02:28:54.885
you take your shield and bash it away.

3668
02:28:54.885 --> 02:28:58.360
It withdraws, unable to grapple you.

3669
02:28:58.360 --> 02:29:01.472
That finishes its turn, Fjord, you're up.

3670
02:29:01.472 --> 02:29:03.316
TRAVIS: Right, it's right next to me.

3671
02:29:03.316 --> 02:29:05.907
Okay, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

3672
02:29:05.907 --> 02:29:09.623
I am going to-- can I see the glyph on the far wall

3673
02:29:09.623 --> 02:29:11.809
on the other side of the jar?

3674
02:29:11.809 --> 02:29:13.970
MATT: You cannot see it from where you're standing,

3675
02:29:13.970 --> 02:29:16.289
but you heard Beau yell about glyphs,

3676
02:29:16.289 --> 02:29:18.873
and you could see the ones the right and left of you.

3677
02:29:18.873 --> 02:29:20.365
TRAVIS: I am going to...

3678
02:29:22.649 --> 02:29:25.540
MATT: Actually, make a perception check for me.

3679
02:29:27.716 --> 02:29:30.827
TRAVIS: No, five.
MATT: Yeah, you don't specifically see it.

3680
02:29:30.827 --> 02:29:32.487
TRAVIS: All right, I don't like these tendrils,

3681
02:29:32.487 --> 02:29:37.134
and I'm not sure if an Eldritch Blast
would shatter that glyph.

3682
02:29:37.134 --> 02:29:38.164
I don't think it's focused enough,

3683
02:29:38.164 --> 02:29:40.534
so I'm going to take two attacks with the Star Razor

3684
02:29:40.534 --> 02:29:42.469
at this tendril.

3685
02:29:42.469 --> 02:29:44.543
MATT: Go for it. Two strikes.

3686
02:29:45.772 --> 02:29:47.212
TRAVIS: A natural 20.
MATT: Whew!

3687
02:29:47.212 --> 02:29:49.460
TRAVIS: And 26.

3688
02:29:49.460 --> 02:29:50.598
MATT: Yeah, both hit.

3689
02:29:50.598 --> 02:29:51.829
TRAVIS: Which is dope, so that's great,

3690
02:29:51.829 --> 02:29:53.854
so we'll do the crit first.

3691
02:29:54.821 --> 02:29:56.658
That's not great.

3692
02:29:56.658 --> 02:29:59.574
Four, five, nine...

3693
02:30:00.741 --> 02:30:02.574
it's 13 points of slashing damage.

3694
02:30:02.574 --> 02:30:03.568
MATT: Okay.

3695
02:30:03.568 --> 02:30:07.151
TRAVIS: The second one is-- man, not great either.

3696
02:30:07.990 --> 02:30:09.773
12 points of slashing damage.

3697
02:30:09.773 --> 02:30:10.836
MATT: 12 points of slashing damage?

3698
02:30:10.836 --> 02:30:12.018
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3699
02:30:12.018 --> 02:30:13.554
MATT: No, that's enough.

3700
02:30:15.254 --> 02:30:16.433
You carve through it and the tendril

3701
02:30:16.433 --> 02:30:19.269
falls into pieces on the ground.

3702
02:30:19.269 --> 02:30:20.119
SAM: Hey!

3703
02:30:20.119 --> 02:30:21.194
TRAVIS: All right, all right.

3704
02:30:21.194 --> 02:30:22.746
TALIESIN: Just going to keep coming.

3705
02:30:22.746 --> 02:30:24.984
SAM: Nah, I think they only have three tendrils.

3706
02:30:24.984 --> 02:30:26.321
That's how hearts work.

3707
02:30:26.321 --> 02:30:29.574
TRAVIS: With my-- wait, do I really want to waste a spell?

3708
02:30:29.574 --> 02:30:32.257
MATT: You still have your movement and your bonus.

3709
02:30:32.257 --> 02:30:35.111
TRAVIS: Right, I will move-- can I try and move

3710
02:30:35.111 --> 02:30:37.659
over on this side of the jar,

3711
02:30:37.659 --> 02:30:40.954
as far as my 30 feet will get me?

3712
02:30:40.954 --> 02:30:43.356
MATT: 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 will get you there.

3713
02:30:43.356 --> 02:30:45.641
TRAVIS: Could it get maybe like right here?
MATT: Oh, there? You can get there if you want.

3714
02:30:45.641 --> 02:30:48.226
TRAVIS: Great, yeah.
MATT: Now you do see the third glyph.

3715
02:30:48.226 --> 02:30:49.059
TRAVIS: Okay.

3716
02:30:49.059 --> 02:30:51.245
That'll be my turn.

3717
02:30:51.245 --> 02:30:52.292
MATT: You've got it.

3718
02:30:52.292 --> 02:30:54.004
That finishes Fjord's go.

3719
02:30:54.004 --> 02:30:55.724
Now top of the round, Jester, you're up.

3720
02:30:55.724 --> 02:30:56.942
LAURA: Okay.

3721
02:30:56.942 --> 02:30:59.121
I'm going to bring my spiritual weapon over

3722
02:30:59.121 --> 02:31:02.257
to start attacking the tendril in front of me.

3723
02:31:02.257 --> 02:31:05.016
MATT: Okay, it can move 20 feet, five, 10, 15, 20,

3724
02:31:05.016 --> 02:31:06.553
it does get within range to make its strike,

3725
02:31:06.553 --> 02:31:09.490
go ahead and roll an attack with your spiritual weapon.

3726
02:31:10.606 --> 02:31:11.748
LAURA: 16.

3727
02:31:11.748 --> 02:31:14.092
MATT: 16 hits.
LAURA: Oh, sweet!

3728
02:31:14.092 --> 02:31:16.008
MATT: These things don't have a super high
armor class, necessarily.

3729
02:31:16.008 --> 02:31:17.192
TRAVIS: The tendrils?
MATT: Tendrils, yeah.

3730
02:31:17.192 --> 02:31:19.079
LAURA: Make sure it is--

3731
02:31:19.079 --> 02:31:22.091
TALIESIN: They're just there to keep us busy.

3732
02:31:22.091 --> 02:31:25.628
LAURA: Yeah, I think it's 2d8 if
I cast it at a 4th-level.

3733
02:31:25.628 --> 02:31:27.605
SAM: Ooh.
LAURA: Yeah.

3734
02:31:27.605 --> 02:31:28.438
Ooh!

3735
02:31:28.438 --> 02:31:30.649
15 plus five, 20.

3736
02:31:30.649 --> 02:31:32.607
MATT: 20 points of damage, nice.

3737
02:31:33.969 --> 02:31:36.526
It slams in the tendril, it recoils,

3738
02:31:36.526 --> 02:31:38.190
spatters a bit of crimson across the ground,

3739
02:31:38.190 --> 02:31:41.055
but it's still holding its position.

3740
02:31:41.938 --> 02:31:42.771
LAURA: Okay.

3741
02:31:43.792 --> 02:31:48.472
Then for my action, I'm going to cast--

3742
02:31:48.472 --> 02:31:49.752
MATT: Looks pretty hurt, though.

3743
02:31:49.752 --> 02:31:51.339
LAURA: Oh.

3744
02:31:51.339 --> 02:31:53.741
I'm going to cast Bless.

3745
02:31:53.741 --> 02:31:57.964
Well, maybe I should-- fuck me running.

3746
02:31:57.964 --> 02:32:01.796
I'm going to cast, yeah, Bless, on...

3747
02:32:01.796 --> 02:32:04.962
myself, on Caleb, and on Caduceus.

3748
02:32:04.962 --> 02:32:06.725
MATT: Okay.

3749
02:32:06.725 --> 02:32:08.054
TRAVIS: So like everybody's blessed.

3750
02:32:08.054 --> 02:32:09.225
MATT and TALIESIN: Everybody's blessed.

3751
02:32:09.225 --> 02:32:10.235
TRAVIS: Awesome.

3752
02:32:11.809 --> 02:32:14.758
LIAM: Bless is on attacks and saves?

3753
02:32:14.758 --> 02:32:15.591
MATT: Correct.

3754
02:32:15.591 --> 02:32:17.764
TALIESIN: Anything with an attack roll,
anything with a save roll.

3755
02:32:17.764 --> 02:32:21.021
MATT: Also, sorry, Caduceus, I need you to make
a constitution saving throw for that Bless,

3756
02:32:21.021 --> 02:32:22.359
you did take damage at the top of its round.

3757
02:32:22.359 --> 02:32:24.077
TALIESIN: Oh, that's fair, that's fair.

3758
02:32:24.077 --> 02:32:25.074
LAURA: Oh, right.

3759
02:32:25.074 --> 02:32:26.793
SAM: Beau, you hit something to unlock it?

3760
02:32:26.793 --> 02:32:28.451
MATT: You're fine.
TALIESIN: 11, yeah, 11.

3761
02:32:28.451 --> 02:32:30.666
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: With Flurry of Blows.

3762
02:32:30.666 --> 02:32:32.013
MATT: You going to move or stay put?

3763
02:32:32.013 --> 02:32:32.913
LAURA: Oh--

3764
02:32:32.913 --> 02:32:36.622
LIAM: She also was able to see an inconsistency

3765
02:32:36.622 --> 02:32:38.549
or a break in the pattern.

3766
02:32:38.549 --> 02:32:40.119
LAURA: I'm going to stay where I am to try to

3767
02:32:40.119 --> 02:32:42.257
keep this tendril occupied.

3768
02:32:42.257 --> 02:32:43.692
MATT: Okay, you stay put.

3769
02:32:43.692 --> 02:32:47.290
Caduceus, you're up, Nott, you're on deck.

3770
02:32:47.290 --> 02:32:48.723
TALIESIN: Let's see.

3771
02:32:48.723 --> 02:32:50.781
I'm going to...

3772
02:32:53.289 --> 02:32:56.455
stay where I am, and just because I'm curious

3773
02:32:56.455 --> 02:33:00.221
what will happen, I'm going to...

3774
02:33:00.221 --> 02:33:03.271
try a Sacred Flame against the symbol

3775
02:33:03.271 --> 02:33:04.679
I can see behind Nott.

3776
02:33:04.679 --> 02:33:06.178
MATT: Symbol behind Nott?

3777
02:33:06.178 --> 02:33:07.692
Okay.

3778
02:33:07.692 --> 02:33:09.595
(whooshes)

3779
02:33:09.595 --> 02:33:10.565
No effect.

3780
02:33:10.565 --> 02:33:12.361
TALIESIN: Oh wait, of course, because it's not a roll.

3781
02:33:12.361 --> 02:33:14.089
Okay.

3782
02:33:14.089 --> 02:33:15.991
God, would I have done-- yeah, I would've done that anyway.

3783
02:33:15.991 --> 02:33:18.247
MATT: You see the flame like burn across the stone.

3784
02:33:18.247 --> 02:33:19.475
No effect on the glyph.

3785
02:33:19.475 --> 02:33:20.933
TALIESIN: Okay, as my--

3786
02:33:22.166 --> 02:33:23.816
that was a dumb thing to do.

3787
02:33:23.816 --> 02:33:24.649
LAURA: That's okay,

3788
02:33:24.649 --> 02:33:25.484
we were just seeing.
TRAVIS: Wouldn't it be amazing if we

3789
02:33:25.484 --> 02:33:27.809
were trying to kill these glyphs first, and then like,

3790
02:33:27.809 --> 02:33:30.334
that's the thing that actually let us fight it?

3791
02:33:31.284 --> 02:33:34.467
TALIESIN: Yeah, no.
LAURA: No, we got to break the thing holding it.

3792
02:33:36.862 --> 02:33:40.266
TALIESIN: Yeah, I don't really have
anything else I can do, do I?

3793
02:33:40.266 --> 02:33:44.624
TRAVIS: I mean, it's keeping it trapped,

3794
02:33:44.624 --> 02:33:45.820
right? Encased.

3795
02:33:45.820 --> 02:33:47.612
MARISHA: The glyphs?

3796
02:33:47.612 --> 02:33:49.678
These plaques on the side, right?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3797
02:33:49.678 --> 02:33:51.486
LAURA: Yep, they're also keeping us
from being able to damage it.

3798
02:33:51.486 --> 02:33:53.283
TRAVIS: We haven't tried to hit the case yet.

3799
02:33:53.283 --> 02:33:55.659
TALIESIN: I'm going to to stay where I am, then.

3800
02:33:55.659 --> 02:33:58.636
MATT: Okay. Finishes your go, Caduceus.
Nott, you're up.

3801
02:33:58.636 --> 02:33:59.981
You are currently grappled by it.

3802
02:33:59.981 --> 02:34:03.214
SAM: I am not going to attempt to--

3803
02:34:03.214 --> 02:34:06.698
I'm going to use my action to investigate that glyph.

3804
02:34:06.698 --> 02:34:08.538
MATT: Unfortunately, it's too far for you to
get a good view on it.

3805
02:34:08.538 --> 02:34:11.804
You'd have to get right up on it
and give it a proper once over.

3806
02:34:11.804 --> 02:34:12.637
MARISHA: Oh.

3807
02:34:12.637 --> 02:34:14.766
SAM: All right. Well then, I'll break free.

3808
02:34:14.766 --> 02:34:16.244
MARISHA: Oh, you're grappled.

3809
02:34:16.244 --> 02:34:17.375
SAM: Or attempt to.

3810
02:34:17.375 --> 02:34:20.225
MATT: Contested strength roll.

3811
02:34:20.225 --> 02:34:21.777
SAM: Hey, that's good.

3812
02:34:21.777 --> 02:34:22.657
19.

3813
02:34:22.657 --> 02:34:24.876
MATT: 14. You manage to free yourself.

3814
02:34:24.876 --> 02:34:25.924
TRAVIS: Yeah!

3815
02:34:25.924 --> 02:34:28.970
MATT: You slip out of its grasp.

3816
02:34:28.970 --> 02:34:32.251
SAM: I'll move over to the glyph, ignoring the attack

3817
02:34:32.251 --> 02:34:34.302
it will get on me, I'm sure.

3818
02:34:34.302 --> 02:34:38.050
MATT: It does swing at you, as its lash as an attempt to

3819
02:34:38.050 --> 02:34:38.969
take you once more.

3820
02:34:38.969 --> 02:34:40.866
That is a 12.

3821
02:34:40.866 --> 02:34:42.073
It misses.

3822
02:34:42.073 --> 02:34:45.894
You duck underneath as it swings past your head.

3823
02:34:45.894 --> 02:34:47.508
You make it to the glyph.

3824
02:34:47.508 --> 02:34:49.019
SAM: And I would need an action.

3825
02:34:49.019 --> 02:34:50.641
MATT: You would need an action to attempt to investigate.

3826
02:34:50.641 --> 02:34:51.542
SAM: No bonus.

3827
02:34:54.982 --> 02:34:56.165
Shit.

3828
02:34:57.136 --> 02:34:59.719
There's not much else I can do.

3829
02:35:01.318 --> 02:35:03.743
Yeah, I guess I'll just sort of--

3830
02:35:04.851 --> 02:35:06.101
I don't know what to do.

3831
02:35:06.101 --> 02:35:08.180
I'll bring the Mage Hand over to me.

3832
02:35:08.180 --> 02:35:09.801
MATT: Okay. How far can it move, 30 feet?

3833
02:35:09.801 --> 02:35:12.473
SAM: Oh actually, know what I'll do?
I'll drink a health potion.

3834
02:35:12.473 --> 02:35:13.542
MATT: Go for it.

3835
02:35:13.542 --> 02:35:15.613
SAM: Ooh.

3836
02:35:15.613 --> 02:35:17.499
Five plus four?

3837
02:35:17.499 --> 02:35:18.374
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: Okay.

3838
02:35:18.374 --> 02:35:20.008
SAM: Nine points.

3839
02:35:20.008 --> 02:35:21.670
MATT: Pass that on over.

3840
02:35:22.511 --> 02:35:24.037
I got it.

3841
02:35:24.037 --> 02:35:25.445
All righty.

3842
02:35:25.445 --> 02:35:26.574
That finishes Nott's go.

3843
02:35:26.574 --> 02:35:29.543
Beauregard, you're up, Caleb, you're on deck.

3844
02:35:29.543 --> 02:35:31.598
LAURA: Can you get to the other glyph?
MARISHA: There's one over here?

3845
02:35:31.598 --> 02:35:32.431
MATT: Yep.

3846
02:35:34.806 --> 02:35:36.721
MARISHA: Five, 10, god.

3847
02:35:36.721 --> 02:35:38.291
TRAVIS: Step of the capillary.

3848
02:35:38.291 --> 02:35:41.000
MARISHA: Yeah, I want to try and make it over there,

3849
02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:42.453
I'll Step of the Wind if I have to.

3850
02:35:42.453 --> 02:35:43.478
MATT: Five--

3851
02:35:43.478 --> 02:35:45.581
TRAVIS: Just follow the brachial artery.

3852
02:35:45.581 --> 02:35:48.874
MATT: (counting) 50 gets you there.

3853
02:35:48.874 --> 02:35:51.686
Step of the Wind will get you up to the glyph.

3854
02:35:51.686 --> 02:35:53.445
MARISHA: Yep, and same thing.

3855
02:35:53.445 --> 02:35:56.236
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make another investigation check.

3856
02:35:56.236 --> 02:35:57.608
TRAVIS: They're not the same glyphs?

3857
02:35:57.608 --> 02:35:59.596
MATT: They are a separate-- they are very different glyphs.

3858
02:35:59.596 --> 02:36:00.888
MARISHA: I don't trust you,

3859
02:36:00.888 --> 02:36:03.551
you've been doing too good; I'm going to mix it up.

3860
02:36:03.551 --> 02:36:05.081
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

3861
02:36:05.081 --> 02:36:05.944
23.

3862
02:36:05.944 --> 02:36:06.943
MATT: 23.

3863
02:36:06.943 --> 02:36:09.279
You look at it, the pattern is different from this time.

3864
02:36:09.279 --> 02:36:11.725
You look at some space that you think
might be similar to the previous glyph,

3865
02:36:11.725 --> 02:36:14.323
you take the staff and chip away at the stone,

3866
02:36:14.323 --> 02:36:17.766
the connection between them stays the same, no effect.

3867
02:36:17.766 --> 02:36:21.164
This one's a little too intricate for you.

3868
02:36:21.164 --> 02:36:23.875
LAURA: Oh, it's too intricate, it's too intricate.

3869
02:36:23.875 --> 02:36:25.235
I wonder if it's a higher DC.

3870
02:36:25.235 --> 02:36:26.250
MARISHA: Fuck.

3871
02:36:26.250 --> 02:36:27.537
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's like a 25.

3872
02:36:27.537 --> 02:36:29.231
LAURA: Oh my god.
TRAVIS: Maybe.

3873
02:36:29.231 --> 02:36:30.803
MATT: That's your turn, Beauregard. Caleb, you're up.

3874
02:36:30.803 --> 02:36:33.628
LAURA: How are we going to do this?
Does Caleb know the symbols?

3875
02:36:33.628 --> 02:36:35.820
LIAM: I see a Beauregard run over there,

3876
02:36:35.820 --> 02:36:39.250
and I will use up my movement and my action

3877
02:36:39.250 --> 02:36:40.882
just to get over.
MATT: Over to her?

3878
02:36:40.882 --> 02:36:41.854
LIAM: To where she went.

3879
02:36:41.854 --> 02:36:44.560
I hear her cursing on the other side of this giant jar.

3880
02:36:44.560 --> 02:36:47.996
SAM: To be fair, she constantly curses everywhere she goes.

3881
02:36:47.996 --> 02:36:49.860
MATT: 60, it takes you all of your movement

3882
02:36:49.860 --> 02:36:51.593
to dash and get up there, and that's your turn.

3883
02:36:51.593 --> 02:36:53.018
You have a bonus action, but.

3884
02:36:53.018 --> 02:36:54.268
SAM: Fuck.
TRAVIS: (belches loudly)

3885
02:36:54.268 --> 02:36:56.104
SAM: Oh!
MATT: Nice.

3886
02:36:56.104 --> 02:36:57.454
LIAM: And that was a bonus action to do that?
LAURA: That was the best burp--

3887
02:36:57.454 --> 02:36:58.797
LIAM: That would be a full action to investigate.
LAURA: -- you've ever had, baby.

3888
02:36:58.797 --> 02:37:00.647
MATT: No, I'm saying you have a bonus action left.

3889
02:37:00.647 --> 02:37:03.410
LIAM: Well, if you'll allow me to investigate it, I will.

3890
02:37:03.410 --> 02:37:05.336
MATT: No, it's an action to investigate, okay.

3891
02:37:05.336 --> 02:37:07.837
LIAM: No, I don't have anything.
MATT: Okay, cool, that finishes your turn.

3892
02:37:07.837 --> 02:37:08.690
It is now--

3893
02:37:08.690 --> 02:37:10.404
LIAM: Oh, I never rolled for Willi.

3894
02:37:10.404 --> 02:37:11.902
MATT: That's right.

3895
02:37:11.902 --> 02:37:13.153
LIAM: Natural 20.

3896
02:37:13.153 --> 02:37:15.020
SAM: What's he doing?
TRAVIS: For Willi.

3897
02:37:15.020 --> 02:37:18.478
LIAM: That's where he is in initiative.
He's following me.

3898
02:37:18.478 --> 02:37:20.003
MATT: I'd say put him at your initiative order

3899
02:37:20.003 --> 02:37:21.803
just to keep it easy for this particular scenario.

3900
02:37:21.803 --> 02:37:25.666
He does take the seven necrotic damage everyone just took.

3901
02:37:25.666 --> 02:37:26.931
LIAM: Oh, he's still up.

3902
02:37:26.931 --> 02:37:28.414
SAM: Hey!
MATT: Okay.

3903
02:37:29.272 --> 02:37:31.206
LAURA: Oh, little Willi.

3904
02:37:31.206 --> 02:37:33.981
MATT: Actually no, cause he's not technically
a living creature, he does not take it, so.

3905
02:37:33.981 --> 02:37:36.133
LAURA: Yay!
MATT: I rescind that.

3906
02:37:36.133 --> 02:37:38.905
LIAM: He's standing behind Beauregard
and Caleb at this point.

3907
02:37:38.905 --> 02:37:41.218
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: Movement and action to follow.

3908
02:37:42.255 --> 02:37:43.301
MATT: He's moved up to there.

3909
02:37:43.301 --> 02:37:44.303
You got it.

3910
02:37:44.303 --> 02:37:46.947
All right, top of the Permaheart's turn.

3911
02:37:46.947 --> 02:37:49.353
The heart swells once again with a heavy beat,

3912
02:37:49.353 --> 02:37:54.208
the energy wave emanating out to the entire chamber.

3913
02:37:54.208 --> 02:37:58.726
Everyone takes four points of necrotic damage.

3914
02:37:58.726 --> 02:38:00.600
TRAVIS: And it's just, it's not-- yeah, yeah, yeah.

3915
02:38:00.600 --> 02:38:01.502
MATT: We'll see if it gets its--

3916
02:38:01.502 --> 02:38:02.702
TRAVIS: You said eight points?

3917
02:38:02.702 --> 02:38:03.792
MARISHA: Four.
TRAVIS: Four.

3918
02:38:03.792 --> 02:38:06.105
MATT: Summon Tendrils recharges.

3919
02:38:06.105 --> 02:38:09.071
TALIESIN: Oh, we have to roll concentration checks.

3920
02:38:09.071 --> 02:38:10.603
MATT: It goes ahead and--

3921
02:38:10.603 --> 02:38:12.629
SAM: Maintain Bless.

3922
02:38:12.629 --> 02:38:15.212
MATT: Summons a tendril there, and then as part of

3923
02:38:15.212 --> 02:38:19.097
the Summon Tendril ability, only one.

3924
02:38:19.097 --> 02:38:22.667
It's going to go ahead and summon a secondary tendril

3925
02:38:22.667 --> 02:38:24.305
on Caduceus' space there.

3926
02:38:24.305 --> 02:38:25.853
SAM: Man, these are gross.

3927
02:38:25.853 --> 02:38:28.835
They're all different, these tendrils!

3928
02:38:28.835 --> 02:38:31.196
MATT: All of them are going to go ahead and make a strike.

3929
02:38:31.196 --> 02:38:32.973
This one's going to move over to here.

3930
02:38:32.973 --> 02:38:34.128
LAURA: Big fat earthworms.

3931
02:38:34.128 --> 02:38:35.375
SAM: Oh, they move.

3932
02:38:35.375 --> 02:38:36.836
MATT: Yeah.
LAURA: They slide?

3933
02:38:36.836 --> 02:38:37.669
They slide?

3934
02:38:37.669 --> 02:38:38.839
MATT: They slither.

3935
02:38:38.839 --> 02:38:40.072
LAURA: Ew!
TALIESIN: That's cool.

3936
02:38:40.072 --> 02:38:41.717
LAURA: Do they pop up from the ground?

3937
02:38:41.717 --> 02:38:42.626
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3938
02:38:42.626 --> 02:38:44.834
It's like, imagine roots of a fleshy tree,

3939
02:38:44.834 --> 02:38:46.217
dislodging from the ground

3940
02:38:46.217 --> 02:38:49.681
and then moving around.
SAM: Fleshy tree? Gross.

3941
02:38:49.681 --> 02:38:51.004
MATT: Go to fleshtree.com.

3942
02:38:51.004 --> 02:38:51.929
(groaning)

3943
02:38:51.929 --> 02:38:55.140
LAURA: Ew, no! Why'd you have to do that?

3944
02:38:55.140 --> 02:38:56.538
MATT: I don't have the URL.

3945
02:38:56.538 --> 02:38:58.390
But congratulations to whoever does,

3946
02:38:58.390 --> 02:39:00.483
possibly now if nobody had it before.

3947
02:39:00.483 --> 02:39:03.102
All right, so, attack against you, Jester.

3948
02:39:03.102 --> 02:39:06.056
Ooh, that's going to be at 27 to hit.

3949
02:39:06.056 --> 02:39:10.242
You take 11 points of bludgeoning damage

3950
02:39:10.242 --> 02:39:11.969
and make it a strength saving throw.

3951
02:39:11.969 --> 02:39:14.286
LAURA: Balls, balls, and balls.
TRAVIS: Come on, beefcake.

3952
02:39:14.286 --> 02:39:15.638
TALIESIN: With a d4.
LAURA: Yeah.

3953
02:39:15.638 --> 02:39:18.148
Strength saving throw.
MATT: Correct.

3954
02:39:18.148 --> 02:39:19.068
LAURA: Whoa.

3955
02:39:19.068 --> 02:39:20.263
SAM: Ooh.

3956
02:39:20.263 --> 02:39:21.430
Not looking great.

3957
02:39:25.303 --> 02:39:26.961
LAURA: Ooh.
SAM: Single digits.

3958
02:39:26.961 --> 02:39:28.019
LAURA: Nine.

3959
02:39:28.019 --> 02:39:30.052
MATT: Nine, you are grappled by it.

3960
02:39:30.052 --> 02:39:32.149
LAURA: I used up--
TALIESIN: Oh, 12, 12.

3961
02:39:32.149 --> 02:39:33.484
LAURA: It was 12?
TALIESIN: Yeah, because you have

3962
02:39:33.484 --> 02:39:35.529
a plus three for strength, right?

3963
02:39:35.529 --> 02:39:37.410
LAURA: No, I think it was nine, I think it was nine.

3964
02:39:37.410 --> 02:39:38.273
MATT: That's okay.

3965
02:39:38.273 --> 02:39:40.025
You are grappled by it, it's wrapped around you,

3966
02:39:40.025 --> 02:39:41.738
and you can feel it pulsing around you.

3967
02:39:41.738 --> 02:39:42.757
It's disgusting.

3968
02:39:42.757 --> 02:39:44.628
Caduceus, one against you.

3969
02:39:44.628 --> 02:39:46.973
That is going to be a 11.

3970
02:39:46.973 --> 02:39:50.968
TALIESIN: That, no, and will the
Shield of Retribution work here?

3971
02:39:50.968 --> 02:39:52.020
MATT: I'd look at the wording of it.

3972
02:39:52.020 --> 02:39:54.833
Is it hit or attacked?

3973
02:39:54.833 --> 02:39:56.410
TALIESIN: Creature misses you with a melee attack.

3974
02:39:56.410 --> 02:39:57.866
MATT: So yeah. So you could.

3975
02:39:57.866 --> 02:40:01.557
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to blast him with arcane force.

3976
02:40:05.435 --> 02:40:06.522
SAM: Arcane force.

3977
02:40:06.522 --> 02:40:08.515
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's-- stop rolling, there we go.

3978
02:40:08.515 --> 02:40:11.535
(laughter)

3979
02:40:11.535 --> 02:40:15.629
Eight, nine, 15 points of force damage.

3980
02:40:15.629 --> 02:40:16.929
MATT: Nice!
TALIESIN: Then it also has to

3981
02:40:16.929 --> 02:40:18.904
succeed a strength throw.

3982
02:40:20.305 --> 02:40:21.927
MATT: That's 12.

3983
02:40:21.927 --> 02:40:24.777
TALIESIN: That's not a successful saving throw, is it?

3984
02:40:24.777 --> 02:40:26.666
So it gets pushed 20 feet away from me.

3985
02:40:26.666 --> 02:40:27.666
LAURA: Oh, tight!

3986
02:40:28.623 --> 02:40:30.072
MATT: (slurping)

3987
02:40:30.072 --> 02:40:32.733
LAURA: I like to think it's really, really tall in the air.

3988
02:40:32.733 --> 02:40:34.612
MATT: Slammed back and hits the pillar

3989
02:40:34.612 --> 02:40:38.642
and spatters some dripping liquid

3990
02:40:38.642 --> 02:40:40.212
off of it across the pillar.

3991
02:40:40.212 --> 02:40:41.919
TALIESIN: Hey.

3992
02:40:41.919 --> 02:40:44.013
MATT: This one's going to attempt to strike you, Nott.

3993
02:40:44.013 --> 02:40:44.850
SAM: Me?

3994
02:40:44.850 --> 02:40:47.095
MATT: That's going to be a 16 to hit.

3995
02:40:47.095 --> 02:40:48.133
SAM: Hey, it misses!

3996
02:40:48.133 --> 02:40:50.028
MATT: You duck and it strikes across the wall.

3997
02:40:51.444 --> 02:40:53.297
Then the one that's going to be attacking you, Caleb.

3998
02:40:53.297 --> 02:40:54.130
LIAM: No good.

3999
02:40:55.994 --> 02:40:57.951
MATT: Jester, I do need a constitution saving throw

4000
02:40:57.951 --> 02:40:59.331
to see if you maintain Bless.
LAURA: Oh, I did one.

4001
02:40:59.331 --> 02:41:00.673
I didn't do one.

4002
02:41:00.673 --> 02:41:02.308
MATT: Against Caleb, that is going to be 26 to hit.

4003
02:41:02.308 --> 02:41:03.611
LAURA: No, it's all--
SAM: Taliesin?

4004
02:41:03.611 --> 02:41:05.641
LAURA: Taliesin is just floating over.

4005
02:41:05.641 --> 02:41:06.727
MATT: 10 points of bludgeoning damage

4006
02:41:06.727 --> 02:41:08.209
and make a strength saving throw.

4007
02:41:08.209 --> 02:41:09.388
LAURA: 10?

4008
02:41:09.388 --> 02:41:11.267
MATT: 10? You're fine.
LAURA: Okay.

4009
02:41:11.267 --> 02:41:14.024
LIAM: The Bless is a d4 on saves?
MATT: Bare minimum was hit.

4010
02:41:14.024 --> 02:41:16.348
LIAM: Bless is a d4 on saves, yeah?
LAURA: I know, it's like sausage.

4011
02:41:16.348 --> 02:41:17.543
(laughter)

4012
02:41:17.543 --> 02:41:18.844
LIAM: It's a natural one.

4013
02:41:18.844 --> 02:41:20.843
MATT: Natural one, you are grappled, my friend.

4014
02:41:20.843 --> 02:41:22.001
LAURA: No!

4015
02:41:22.001 --> 02:41:25.327
MATT: You are now held by one of these.

4016
02:41:25.327 --> 02:41:26.197
It's now wrapped around your chest

4017
02:41:26.197 --> 02:41:27.710
and it's lifted you slightly off the ground,

4018
02:41:27.710 --> 02:41:29.440
your feet are scraping across

4019
02:41:29.440 --> 02:41:31.586
the bit of stone and errant flesh below you,

4020
02:41:31.586 --> 02:41:33.944
and you're trying to look at the thing

4021
02:41:33.944 --> 02:41:34.786
in front of you.

4022
02:41:34.786 --> 02:41:36.512
You're still close up to it.

4023
02:41:36.512 --> 02:41:37.615
That finishes its turn.

4024
02:41:37.615 --> 02:41:38.662
Fjord, you're up.

4025
02:41:38.662 --> 02:41:41.999
TRAVIS: I'm see the tendril attack Jester across the way,

4026
02:41:41.999 --> 02:41:46.038
and I'll send one blast of Eldritch Blast

4027
02:41:46.038 --> 02:41:49.945
towards the tendril, and the second one to the case.

4028
02:41:49.945 --> 02:41:51.199
MATT: Which one, the tendril there?

4029
02:41:51.199 --> 02:41:53.312
TRAVIS: That one, and then I'm
going to shoot the heart case.

4030
02:41:53.312 --> 02:41:54.145
MATT: Got it.

4031
02:41:54.145 --> 02:41:55.994
SAM: I'm going to save everybody.

4032
02:41:55.994 --> 02:41:58.713
TRAVIS: The first one is a natural 20 against Jester,

4033
02:41:58.713 --> 02:42:02.280
and the second one is just a flat 20.

4034
02:42:02.280 --> 02:42:03.725
MATT: A flat 20? Okay.

4035
02:42:03.725 --> 02:42:05.876
The flat 20 misses.

4036
02:42:05.876 --> 02:42:07.065
SAM: What?!
TRAVIS: Against the case?

4037
02:42:07.065 --> 02:42:11.339
MATT: The case itself is pretty tough.

4038
02:42:11.339 --> 02:42:15.116
It impacts, and you can see it, like, impact,

4039
02:42:15.116 --> 02:42:16.820
and you get the sense it probably can be damaged,

4040
02:42:16.820 --> 02:42:17.746
it's just pretty tough.

4041
02:42:17.746 --> 02:42:18.774
TRAVIS: Copy that.

4042
02:42:18.774 --> 02:42:21.364
MATT: However, roll damage for the one against Jester.

4043
02:42:21.364 --> 02:42:23.129
TALIESIN: Oh, did you add a d4 to both those attacks?

4044
02:42:23.129 --> 02:42:23.962
TRAVIS: No.

4045
02:42:23.962 --> 02:42:25.638
MATT: Because you are blessed.

4046
02:42:25.638 --> 02:42:26.625
TRAVIS: 22?

4047
02:42:26.625 --> 02:42:27.864
MATT: 22 still does not hit.

4048
02:42:27.864 --> 02:42:29.278
TRAVIS: Okay, great.

4049
02:42:29.278 --> 02:42:33.278
That is a seven plus, 12--

4050
02:42:33.278 --> 02:42:36.262
SAM: Heartbeat is driving me crazy.
TRAVIS: -- there's no Hexblade,

4051
02:42:36.262 --> 02:42:38.237
so 13 points of--
MATT: That's the point.

4052
02:42:38.237 --> 02:42:39.731
TALIESIN: It's really hard to think.

4053
02:42:39.731 --> 02:42:41.247
MARISHA: I hate it.

4054
02:42:41.247 --> 02:42:42.434
MATT: I love it.

4055
02:42:42.434 --> 02:42:44.072
(laughter)

4056
02:42:44.072 --> 02:42:46.289
TRAVIS: 13 points of force damage.

4057
02:42:46.289 --> 02:42:47.702
MATT: 13 points of force damage.

4058
02:42:47.702 --> 02:42:49.100
TRAVIS: I'm sorry, 15.

4059
02:42:49.100 --> 02:42:50.162
SAM: Yay!

4060
02:42:50.162 --> 02:42:52.588
MATT: You splatter it, like, it's wrapped around Jester,

4061
02:42:52.588 --> 02:42:54.535
it explodes across its base element

4062
02:42:54.535 --> 02:42:56.911
as Jester falls to her feet, the rest of it goes

4063
02:42:56.911 --> 02:42:59.303
lax onto the ground.

4064
02:42:59.303 --> 02:43:00.844
LAURA: Yay!

4065
02:43:00.844 --> 02:43:02.714
TRAVIS: Does it look like the-- when I hit the case

4066
02:43:02.714 --> 02:43:05.124
with the damage, does it look like it absorbs

4067
02:43:05.124 --> 02:43:06.249
or just bounces off,

4068
02:43:06.249 --> 02:43:08.265
or any sort of reaction?
MATT: It looked like it just glanced.

4069
02:43:08.265 --> 02:43:09.743
Like you didn't quite hit at the right angle

4070
02:43:09.743 --> 02:43:12.321
for the brunt of it to actually impact.

4071
02:43:12.321 --> 02:43:15.644
TRAVIS: I will move 10 feet towards you,

4072
02:43:15.644 --> 02:43:17.340
just to get away from that tendril.

4073
02:43:17.340 --> 02:43:18.981
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: Get me...

4074
02:43:18.981 --> 02:43:19.814
That's fine, that's fine.

4075
02:43:19.814 --> 02:43:20.933
MATT: Okay.

4076
02:43:20.933 --> 02:43:22.230
Finishing Fjord's turn, Jester, you're up,

4077
02:43:22.230 --> 02:43:23.117
Caduceus, you're on deck.

4078
02:43:23.117 --> 02:43:24.778
LAURA: Okay.

4079
02:43:25.945 --> 02:43:27.048
I don't know what kind of--

4080
02:43:27.048 --> 02:43:28.561
TRAVIS: Can I come up against the ridge, actually?

4081
02:43:28.561 --> 02:43:29.731
Closer to the heart?

4082
02:43:29.731 --> 02:43:31.356
MATT: Sure, about there?
TRAVIS: Yeah, right there.

4083
02:43:32.912 --> 02:43:36.287
MATT: You can move one more if you wanted to get--
TRAVIS: Just right up on it, as close as I can get.

4084
02:43:37.187 --> 02:43:39.330
LAURA: I'll wait on this, I'll wait on this.

4085
02:43:39.330 --> 02:43:43.381
I'm going to-- that's a bonus action!

4086
02:43:43.381 --> 02:43:47.205
Will my spiritual weapon get up to the tendril right there?

4087
02:43:47.205 --> 02:43:49.649
MATT: Right there? Yeah.

4088
02:43:49.649 --> 02:43:51.485
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to have it attack that.

4089
02:43:51.485 --> 02:43:52.439
MATT: Go for it.

4090
02:43:52.439 --> 02:43:54.591
MARISHA: Right. Well, I'm going to help you.

4091
02:43:54.591 --> 02:43:56.690
LAURA: That's 23 to hit.

4092
02:43:56.690 --> 02:43:59.818
MATT: That definitely hits, go ahead and roll damage.

4093
02:43:59.818 --> 02:44:02.400
LAURA: 12 plus five, 17.

4094
02:44:02.400 --> 02:44:03.672
Yeah, 17.

4095
02:44:03.672 --> 02:44:04.644
SAM: Hey!

4096
02:44:04.644 --> 02:44:06.121
MATT: That tendril gets slammed into the ground

4097
02:44:06.121 --> 02:44:08.036
and you see it try and recoil and the weapon follows up

4098
02:44:08.036 --> 02:44:11.872
with a second strike, then it goes limp, no longer moving.

4099
02:44:11.872 --> 02:44:14.926
LAURA: Having seen Fjord-- ooh, I don't know.

4100
02:44:14.926 --> 02:44:18.885
I'm going-- that's a bonus action, I can't do that.

4101
02:44:20.979 --> 02:44:23.414
Oy, god.

4102
02:44:23.414 --> 02:44:25.622
I'm going to, um...

4103
02:44:26.613 --> 02:44:30.167
Guiding Bolt the tendril over by Nott.

4104
02:44:30.167 --> 02:44:32.125
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: Actually the one--

4105
02:44:32.125 --> 02:44:34.008
Can I see the one that's got Caleb?

4106
02:44:34.008 --> 02:44:35.851
Because he's actually grappled, huh?

4107
02:44:35.851 --> 02:44:37.180
MATT: You can--
LAURA: Let me move--

4108
02:44:37.180 --> 02:44:40.106
I'll scooch over so that I can get a better visual on it.

4109
02:44:41.148 --> 02:44:43.348
MATT: That would give you a visual
where it doesn't have any cover.

4110
02:44:43.348 --> 02:44:45.741
LAURA: Yeah, okay, I'll do that. Guiding Bolt on that one.

4111
02:44:45.741 --> 02:44:46.584
MATT: Go for it.

4112
02:44:46.584 --> 02:44:47.983
SAM: Thank you for saving me.

4113
02:44:47.983 --> 02:44:50.153
LAURA: Sorry, Caleb's grappled.
SAM: Wait-- oh.

4114
02:44:50.153 --> 02:44:50.986
LAURA: 22.

4115
02:44:50.986 --> 02:44:53.768
MATT: That hits, go ahead and roll damage.
LAURA: Okay.

4116
02:44:53.768 --> 02:44:56.171
It's 4d6 radiant.

4117
02:44:56.171 --> 02:44:58.044
(laughter)

4118
02:44:59.002 --> 02:45:01.958
Eight, nine, 11 points of radiant damage.

4119
02:45:01.958 --> 02:45:03.354
11 points of radiant damage.

4120
02:45:03.354 --> 02:45:06.769
Gets blasted in the side, it burns up the edge
of the thicker part of the tendril.

4121
02:45:06.769 --> 02:45:10.590
You can see the blackened spot where it's burned
and the radiant energy spirals up

4122
02:45:10.590 --> 02:45:12.295
before the magic dissipates.

4123
02:45:12.295 --> 02:45:14.092
It looks wounded, but it's still standing.

4124
02:45:14.092 --> 02:45:15.422
LAURA: Next one has advantage.

4125
02:45:15.422 --> 02:45:17.131
MATT: That's true.

4126
02:45:17.131 --> 02:45:19.312
TALIESIN: Did the radiant feel like it
really did anything, or did it--

4127
02:45:19.312 --> 02:45:20.365
MATT: No more than it usually does.

4128
02:45:20.365 --> 02:45:22.957
TALIESIN: I don't have a view anyway.
Well, I do have a view, actually.

4129
02:45:22.957 --> 02:45:24.969
MATT: You do, but no more than it usually does.

4130
02:45:24.969 --> 02:45:26.152
LAURA: Okay.

4131
02:45:26.152 --> 02:45:29.644
MATT: That brings us to Caduceus's go.

4132
02:45:29.644 --> 02:45:30.503
SAM: Great.

4133
02:45:30.503 --> 02:45:32.285
MATT: Nott, you're on deck.

4134
02:45:32.285 --> 02:45:33.353
SAM: That's good.

4135
02:45:33.353 --> 02:45:35.219
TALIESIN: I'll do-- well...

4136
02:45:36.969 --> 02:45:38.260
let's see.

4137
02:45:39.182 --> 02:45:44.182
I will try a Sacred Flame against the one that's got

4138
02:45:44.942 --> 02:45:46.289
Caleb over there.

4139
02:45:46.289 --> 02:45:48.980
MATT: Okay, it's a dexterity saving throw, you said?

4140
02:45:48.980 --> 02:45:49.990
Natural 20.

4141
02:45:49.990 --> 02:45:51.683
TALIESIN: Fuck me.
MATT: Sorry.

4142
02:45:51.683 --> 02:45:54.217
TALIESIN: All right, I'm biding my time.

4143
02:45:54.217 --> 02:45:55.224
MATT: Staying put?

4144
02:45:55.224 --> 02:45:58.821
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a few
steps forward and to the left.

4145
02:45:58.821 --> 02:46:01.515
MATT: To the left, so like here?

4146
02:46:01.515 --> 02:46:05.122
TALIESIN: Yeah, just so I can stay
within some range of some people.

4147
02:46:05.122 --> 02:46:06.138
MATT: Okay.

4148
02:46:06.138 --> 02:46:07.751
TALIESIN: If they need healing, I can start doing that.

4149
02:46:07.751 --> 02:46:10.900
MATT: That'll work. That finishes Caduceus too.
Nott you're up, Beau, you're on deck.

4150
02:46:10.900 --> 02:46:14.748
SAM: I'm going to investigate the glyph!
MATT: Go for it, roll an investigation check.

4151
02:46:14.748 --> 02:46:15.757
SAM: Come on!

4152
02:46:15.757 --> 02:46:17.827
MARISHA: Come on!
LIAM: Natural 20.

4153
02:46:17.827 --> 02:46:19.107
SAM: 22.

4154
02:46:19.107 --> 02:46:20.602
Oh wait, I get things, right?

4155
02:46:20.602 --> 02:46:21.698
TALIESIN: Not for that.

4156
02:46:21.698 --> 02:46:22.868
MATT: Not for ability checks.

4157
02:46:22.868 --> 02:46:24.118
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4158
02:46:24.118 --> 02:46:26.101
MATT: 22. You look at it and look over it,

4159
02:46:26.101 --> 02:46:29.362
and you're like, you've looked over
at Caleb's notes occasionally.

4160
02:46:29.362 --> 02:46:33.260
He knows stuff like this, you should be able
to figure something out, and you can see some connections,

4161
02:46:33.260 --> 02:46:34.947
but it's too confusing.

4162
02:46:34.947 --> 02:46:38.094
Your brain starting to hurt even trying to figure it out.

4163
02:46:38.094 --> 02:46:39.912
LAURA: I have Enhance Abilities.

4164
02:46:39.912 --> 02:46:41.212
SAM: I'll drink some alcohol.

4165
02:46:41.212 --> 02:46:42.222
MATT: Okay.

4166
02:46:42.222 --> 02:46:44.041
I'll give you bonus action swig, sure.

4167
02:46:44.041 --> 02:46:45.606
SAM: Sure.
MATT: (laughs)

4168
02:46:45.606 --> 02:46:46.981
TRAVIS: Does that make you smarter?
SAM: Maybe.

4169
02:46:46.981 --> 02:46:49.453
MATT: You going to stay put?

4170
02:46:49.453 --> 02:46:52.546
SAM: I mean, I can't keep trying that, can I?

4171
02:46:52.546 --> 02:46:54.153
MATT: It's an action to try, but you can keep--

4172
02:46:54.153 --> 02:46:56.844
possibly try next round if you want to.
SAM: Okay, then I will stay put.

4173
02:46:56.844 --> 02:46:58.464
MATT: All right, finishing your turn.

4174
02:46:58.464 --> 02:46:59.583
Beauregard, you're up, Caleb, you're on deck.

4175
02:46:59.583 --> 02:47:02.447
MARISHA: Okay, I see Caleb run over over my shoulder,

4176
02:47:02.447 --> 02:47:06.417
and I go: I started feeling like I was getting a lead,

4177
02:47:06.417 --> 02:47:08.345
and then I feel like I'm missing it.

4178
02:47:08.345 --> 02:47:11.111
I was trying to hit this one, but it's not right.

4179
02:47:11.111 --> 02:47:15.410
And I can I use the help action to help him

4180
02:47:15.410 --> 02:47:16.316
on his next roll?

4181
02:47:16.316 --> 02:47:17.316
MATT: If you use your action to help him,

4182
02:47:17.316 --> 02:47:18.891
yes you can, because you guys are right by each other.

4183
02:47:18.891 --> 02:47:21.862
MARISHA: And try and sudoku the fuck out of this.
MATT: Yeah, yeah.

4184
02:47:21.862 --> 02:47:22.937
You guys can do exactly that.

4185
02:47:22.937 --> 02:47:24.249
MARISHA: Me too!

4186
02:47:24.249 --> 02:47:26.817
MATT: You spend your action-- and you'd have to stay put--

4187
02:47:26.817 --> 02:47:27.806
MARISHA: Yes.

4188
02:47:27.806 --> 02:47:29.819
MATT: --at the end of your turn,
but when it comes to his round,

4189
02:47:29.819 --> 02:47:31.420
he will get advantage on his check.

4190
02:47:31.420 --> 02:47:32.412
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

4191
02:47:32.412 --> 02:47:33.946
MARISHA: Do I have a bonus action?

4192
02:47:33.946 --> 02:47:36.511
MATT: You have a bonus action.

4193
02:47:36.511 --> 02:47:39.194
LIAM: (singing with background music)

4194
02:47:39.194 --> 02:47:42.635
TRAVIS: (singing with background music)

4195
02:47:42.635 --> 02:47:44.893
SAM: (singing with background music)

4196
02:47:44.893 --> 02:47:46.329
MARISHA: No, I'll just wait.

4197
02:47:46.329 --> 02:47:47.212
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: That's it.

4198
02:47:47.212 --> 02:47:49.436
MATT: All right. Caleb, you're up.

4199
02:47:49.436 --> 02:47:52.096
TRAVIS: Come on.
LIAM: Willi, <i>Hilf mir</i>.

4200
02:47:52.096 --> 02:47:55.589
The golem starts beating the shit out of
the tentacle that's holding me.

4201
02:47:55.589 --> 02:47:56.589
MATT: Go for it.

4202
02:47:58.329 --> 02:47:59.205
LIAM: Okay.

4203
02:47:59.205 --> 02:48:00.622
SAM: Where there's a <i>Villi</i>.

4204
02:48:00.622 --> 02:48:02.639
MARISHA: There's a <i>vay</i>.

4205
02:48:02.639 --> 02:48:04.211
LIAM: That is a 25 to hit.

4206
02:48:04.211 --> 02:48:06.636
MATT: That hits.
LIAM: For the first, and the second is higher.

4207
02:48:06.636 --> 02:48:09.277
So that is...

4208
02:48:09.277 --> 02:48:10.488
2d6 plus three.

4209
02:48:11.522 --> 02:48:15.196
First does five and the second does...

4210
02:48:16.422 --> 02:48:18.230
10, so 15 total.

4211
02:48:18.230 --> 02:48:19.200
MATT: 10, that'll do it.

4212
02:48:19.200 --> 02:48:20.211
SAM: Yeah!

4213
02:48:20.211 --> 02:48:22.615
MATT: Your golem turns around and just punches it once,

4214
02:48:22.615 --> 02:48:24.614
it recoils and you feel yourself thrashed around.

4215
02:48:24.614 --> 02:48:26.792
It grabs with the other hand and then just

4216
02:48:26.792 --> 02:48:30.531
splits it in half, and you're released back onto the ground

4217
02:48:30.531 --> 02:48:32.143
and you are no longer grappled.

4218
02:48:32.143 --> 02:48:35.811
LIAM: Somehow I don't slip and fall on my ass
and I just start examining and looking where

4219
02:48:35.811 --> 02:48:37.761
Beauregard's hand is tracing on the wall.

4220
02:48:37.761 --> 02:48:40.636
MATT: You get to make an arcana check with advantage
because she is helping you.

4221
02:48:40.636 --> 02:48:41.784
Or investigation, your choice.

4222
02:48:41.784 --> 02:48:43.628
Investigation or arcana.
MARISHA: With advantage, right?

4223
02:48:43.628 --> 02:48:45.738
LIAM: I'll do investigation.

4224
02:48:45.738 --> 02:48:48.783
TRAVIS: Are we getting splattered with gore
every time we kill one of these tentacles?

4225
02:48:48.783 --> 02:48:49.790
MATT: Yeah, it's pretty--

4226
02:48:49.790 --> 02:48:53.470
TRAVIS: Do we look like the blood dance in Blade,
the first Blade movie?

4227
02:48:53.470 --> 02:48:56.780
MATT: You guys look like you're like hitting
the second or third act of Descent.

4228
02:48:56.780 --> 02:48:58.945
LIAM: 24, 24.

4229
02:48:58.945 --> 02:48:59.994
MATT: 24.

4230
02:48:59.994 --> 02:49:01.767
(grunts)

4231
02:49:01.767 --> 02:49:06.384
You can see where it connects and you can see
where all these-- you now see the overall equation

4232
02:49:06.384 --> 02:49:08.998
where all these come together to help define--

4233
02:49:08.998 --> 02:49:11.159
and you can discern that all of these are attached

4234
02:49:11.159 --> 02:49:14.252
to hold this protective element.

4235
02:49:14.252 --> 02:49:16.717
You get the sense, it can be physically destroyed

4236
02:49:16.717 --> 02:49:18.223
through brute force.

4237
02:49:18.223 --> 02:49:19.470
LAURA: Oh, the glyphs.

4238
02:49:20.453 --> 02:49:22.646
MATT: Well not the glyphs, the actual--
the containment unit,

4239
02:49:22.646 --> 02:49:25.140
but the glyphs are another way of disabling it,

4240
02:49:25.140 --> 02:49:29.020
but you're uncertain how to disable this one.

4241
02:49:30.020 --> 02:49:32.214
That finishes your turn.

4242
02:49:32.214 --> 02:49:34.896
It's now the Permaheart's turn.
LAURA: Oh god, no!

4243
02:49:34.896 --> 02:49:36.654
MATT: Everybody suffers...

4244
02:49:36.654 --> 02:49:40.453
six points of necrotic damage throughout the chamber.

4245
02:49:41.321 --> 02:49:42.277
TRAVIS: I don't like it.

4246
02:49:42.277 --> 02:49:46.410
MATT: It re-summons one tendril.

4247
02:49:46.410 --> 02:49:49.426
This tendril's going to appear here.

4248
02:49:50.707 --> 02:49:53.307
TRAVIS: What's the melee range on those tentacles? 10 or 15?

4249
02:49:53.307 --> 02:49:55.164
MATT: That's to see if it--

4250
02:49:55.164 --> 02:49:59.336
yeah, it gets its Summon Tendrils back, that's doing well.

4251
02:49:59.336 --> 02:50:00.790
It summons back--

4252
02:50:00.790 --> 02:50:03.399
TRAVIS: Don't you grin.

4253
02:50:03.399 --> 02:50:05.102
SAM: Don't you be happy.
LAURA: Don't you be happy.

4254
02:50:05.102 --> 02:50:06.935
MATT: Only one.
TRAVIS: Only one.

4255
02:50:06.935 --> 02:50:08.645
MATT: This one's going to go ahead and--

4256
02:50:08.645 --> 02:50:11.479
SAM: But this tendril has five heads.

4257
02:50:11.479 --> 02:50:14.871
MATT: It's going to attack against-- they do have
a range of 10 feet, you've noticed now.

4258
02:50:14.871 --> 02:50:17.644
So even that far away, they (whooshes).
That's one against you, Nott.

4259
02:50:17.644 --> 02:50:19.221
SAM: (shouts)
MATT: Natural 20.

4260
02:50:19.221 --> 02:50:20.981
LAURA: No!
SAM: Hits.

4261
02:50:20.981 --> 02:50:23.081
TALIESIN: I'm not within 30 feet of that.
MATT: You are not.

4262
02:50:23.081 --> 02:50:25.307
TALIESIN: Okay, nevermind.

4263
02:50:25.307 --> 02:50:28.299
MATT: That is 15 points of bludgeoning damage.

4264
02:50:28.299 --> 02:50:30.994
SAM: I will halve that to seven.

4265
02:50:30.994 --> 02:50:32.690
MATT: Okay, so you take seven.

4266
02:50:32.690 --> 02:50:36.477
There is an attack against you, Caduceus.
SAM: Is it grappling me now, or?

4267
02:50:36.477 --> 02:50:38.318
MATT: Yes, you are grappled.
SAM: Dammit!

4268
02:50:38.318 --> 02:50:41.918
LAURA: Oh wait, you have to do a strength saving throw.
MATT: I'm sorry, yes, make a strength saving throw.

4269
02:50:41.918 --> 02:50:43.301
LAURA: Plus four.

4270
02:50:43.301 --> 02:50:46.303
SAM: Plus a d4.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4271
02:50:46.303 --> 02:50:48.507
SAM: Oh, that helped. 16.

4272
02:50:48.507 --> 02:50:50.261
MATT: 16's enough.
SAM: Hey!

4273
02:50:50.261 --> 02:50:53.485
MATT: You are not grappled. Caduceus, that is a...

4274
02:50:53.485 --> 02:50:55.202
28 to hit.

4275
02:50:55.202 --> 02:50:56.959
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, that hits.

4276
02:50:56.959 --> 02:50:59.042
MATT: You suffer...

4277
02:50:59.042 --> 02:51:00.625
nine points of bludgeoning damage.

4278
02:51:00.625 --> 02:51:02.910
I need you to make a constitution
saving throw with advantage.

4279
02:51:02.910 --> 02:51:06.632
LAURA: ♪ Balls and balls and balls ♪
SAM: ♪ So many balls ♪

4280
02:51:06.632 --> 02:51:07.815
TALIESIN: 18.

4281
02:51:07.815 --> 02:51:10.323
MATT: Yeah, you're fine. However,
do make a strength saving throw for me.

4282
02:51:10.323 --> 02:51:13.598
As it attempts to grapple you within its...

4283
02:51:14.514 --> 02:51:16.964
tentacled grip.

4284
02:51:17.935 --> 02:51:18.848
TALIESIN: Nine.

4285
02:51:18.848 --> 02:51:21.464
MATT: Nope, you are grappled by the tentacle now.

4286
02:51:21.464 --> 02:51:23.406
It's wrapped around you and holding you there,

4287
02:51:23.406 --> 02:51:26.243
and the other one's going to
make a strike against you, Caleb.

4288
02:51:26.243 --> 02:51:28.279
That is going to be a 21 to hit.

4289
02:51:28.279 --> 02:51:29.891
LIAM: Hits.
MATT: All right.

4290
02:51:29.891 --> 02:51:31.632
You suffer...

4291
02:51:32.665 --> 02:51:36.590
12 points of bludgeoning damage,
and make a strength saving throw for me.

4292
02:51:37.476 --> 02:51:41.614
SAM: This is all just to get the heart open.

4293
02:51:41.614 --> 02:51:42.447
TALIESIN: Yep.

4294
02:51:42.447 --> 02:51:45.333
LAURA: Well maybe once we get it open,
we can just kill the heart.

4295
02:51:45.333 --> 02:51:47.858
SAM: Yeah, one shot, it has two hit points.

4296
02:51:47.858 --> 02:51:52.025
MATT: Both Caduceus and Caleb are both
grappled by tendrils in space.

4297
02:51:52.025 --> 02:51:53.692
Ending their turn, Fjord, you're up.

4298
02:51:53.692 --> 02:51:56.774
MARISHA: Tendrils in space.
MATT: There you go.

4299
02:51:56.774 --> 02:51:58.085
SAM: Great porn.

4300
02:51:58.085 --> 02:51:59.708
LAURA: (laughs)

4301
02:51:59.708 --> 02:52:03.299
TRAVIS: I am going to move to--

4302
02:52:03.299 --> 02:52:06.033
no, I'm going to do an Eldritch Blast against--

4303
02:52:07.061 --> 02:52:10.048
SAM: Uh huh?
MARISHA: Not great.

4304
02:52:10.048 --> 02:52:12.109
SAM: He's got a potion or something, he'll be fine.

4305
02:52:12.109 --> 02:52:13.927
TRAVIS: I'm going to do-- (frustrated yell)

4306
02:52:13.927 --> 02:52:17.202
SAM: He's got you next to him, he'll be fine.
TRAVIS: How are you doing?

4307
02:52:17.202 --> 02:52:18.824
SAM: He's got Lay on Hands, he'll be fine.

4308
02:52:18.824 --> 02:52:20.635
TALIESIN: Not great.
LIAM: Four more hit points.

4309
02:52:20.635 --> 02:52:23.495
TRAVIS: I'm going to send both Eldritch Blasts at the--

4310
02:52:23.495 --> 02:52:25.338
I'll send the first Eldritch Blast

4311
02:52:25.338 --> 02:52:26.817
at the tentacle nearest Caleb.

4312
02:52:26.817 --> 02:52:29.529
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll for an attack on that one.

4313
02:52:29.529 --> 02:52:33.157
TALIESIN: Add a d4.
TRAVIS: Oh, thank you.

4314
02:52:33.157 --> 02:52:33.990
20.

4315
02:52:33.990 --> 02:52:35.540
MATT: That hits.
TRAVIS: Okay.

4316
02:52:38.506 --> 02:52:40.704
That's 14 points of force damage.

4317
02:52:41.662 --> 02:52:43.160
MATT: 14 points of force damage, nice.

4318
02:52:43.160 --> 02:52:47.482
Gets slammed, it's still holding its current form

4319
02:52:47.482 --> 02:52:51.952
and clutching Caleb within its wrapped tentacle.

4320
02:52:51.952 --> 02:52:53.735
TRAVIS: I will send the...

4321
02:52:56.176 --> 02:52:59.076
second blast towards the one at Caduceus.

4322
02:52:59.076 --> 02:53:02.038
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll an attack on that one.

4323
02:53:02.038 --> 02:53:04.295
TRAVIS: 25.

4324
02:53:04.295 --> 02:53:07.795
MATT: That hits, go ahead and roll damage.

4325
02:53:08.709 --> 02:53:10.673
TRAVIS: 16 points of force damage.

4326
02:53:10.673 --> 02:53:12.617
MATT: Blasts into that one, that one also,

4327
02:53:12.617 --> 02:53:15.201
both looking fairly wounded, but still holding on

4328
02:53:15.201 --> 02:53:16.676
to their current targets.

4329
02:53:18.203 --> 02:53:19.373
TRAVIS: They have more than 15.

4330
02:53:19.373 --> 02:53:21.335
MATT: They have more than 15.

4331
02:53:21.335 --> 02:53:23.009
TRAVIS: Shit, okay.

4332
02:53:23.009 --> 02:53:24.259
MATT: Stay put, or?

4333
02:53:26.078 --> 02:53:27.393
LAURA: Did you say stay porn?

4334
02:53:27.393 --> 02:53:29.918
TRAVIS: Stay porn, yeah, I'm going to stay put.

4335
02:53:29.918 --> 02:53:31.451
SAM and MATT: Stay porny, guys.

4336
02:53:31.451 --> 02:53:32.899
(laughter)

4337
02:53:32.899 --> 02:53:34.641
LAURA: www.fleshtree.com.

4338
02:53:34.641 --> 02:53:36.802
(groaning and laughing)

4339
02:53:36.802 --> 02:53:38.974
LIAM: Is it Pornsday yet?

4340
02:53:39.832 --> 02:53:41.788
TRAVIS: I'll stay put. No bonus action.

4341
02:53:41.788 --> 02:53:43.558
MATT: All right. Finishes Fjord's turn,

4342
02:53:43.558 --> 02:53:44.608
Jester, you're up, Caduceus, you're on deck.

4343
02:53:44.608 --> 02:53:45.516
LAURA: Oh god.

4344
02:53:45.516 --> 02:53:46.866
SAM: Happy Arbor Day.

4345
02:53:46.866 --> 02:53:48.032
LAURA: Okay.

4346
02:53:48.032 --> 02:53:49.600
SAM: Go fuck a tree.

4347
02:53:49.600 --> 02:53:52.046
(laughter)

4348
02:53:52.046 --> 02:53:57.046
LAURA: Can my lollipop get up to the cage?

4349
02:53:58.033 --> 02:53:59.068
MATT: The cage?
LAURA: Yeah.

4350
02:53:59.068 --> 02:54:00.065
MATT: Yeah, it can get there.

4351
02:54:00.065 --> 02:54:01.191
LAURA: Yeah, it's going to try and attack it.

4352
02:54:01.191 --> 02:54:03.526
MATT: Go for it, roll for an attack.

4353
02:54:05.801 --> 02:54:07.322
LAURA: 23.
TALIESIN: Plus four.

4354
02:54:07.322 --> 02:54:10.381
LAURA: Plus four.
MATT: Plus a d4.

4355
02:54:12.094 --> 02:54:13.310
SAM: Yes!
LAURA: 26.

4356
02:54:13.310 --> 02:54:15.850
MATT: That does hit. Go ahead and roll damage.

4357
02:54:15.850 --> 02:54:17.437
SAM: What are you attacking?

4358
02:54:17.437 --> 02:54:19.799
LAURA: With my serrated lollipop, I'm attacking the thing

4359
02:54:19.799 --> 02:54:21.299
holding the heart.

4360
02:54:22.378 --> 02:54:24.912
Nine plus five is 14 points.

4361
02:54:24.912 --> 02:54:27.142
MATT: 14 points.

4362
02:54:27.142 --> 02:54:28.294
LAURA: Of lollipop damage.

4363
02:54:28.294 --> 02:54:31.669
MATT: It slams into the outside of the glass
arcane containment.

4364
02:54:31.669 --> 02:54:34.009
As it hits, all the glyphs flash for a second

4365
02:54:34.009 --> 02:54:37.254
and a tiny crack builds at the point of impact.

4366
02:54:37.254 --> 02:54:38.697
LAURA: Okay, okay.
MATT: It's taking damage.

4367
02:54:38.697 --> 02:54:40.744
LAURA: Okay.

4368
02:54:40.744 --> 02:54:43.314
Oh, I got to wait on this thing!

4369
02:54:43.314 --> 02:54:44.934
Okay.

4370
02:54:44.934 --> 02:54:47.634
I'm also going to cast...

4371
02:54:47.634 --> 02:54:49.021
Jesus.

4372
02:54:49.021 --> 02:54:50.054
SAM: Going to cast Jesus?

4373
02:54:50.054 --> 02:54:51.999
LAURA: I'm going to cast Jesus.

4374
02:54:51.999 --> 02:54:54.182
I'm going to use--
SAM: Peace and love.

4375
02:54:54.182 --> 02:54:57.949
LAURA: Sacred Flame at--
SAM: Hi.

4376
02:54:58.957 --> 02:55:02.622
LAURA: -- the one attacking Caleb again.

4377
02:55:02.622 --> 02:55:05.896
MATT: Okay. That's a dexterity saving throw?

4378
02:55:05.896 --> 02:55:06.737
13.

4379
02:55:06.737 --> 02:55:09.019
LAURA: Misses. I mean, I hit it.

4380
02:55:09.019 --> 02:55:09.945
MATT: Yes, you do.
LAURA: It doesn't save.

4381
02:55:09.945 --> 02:55:11.604
MATT: You do hit.

4382
02:55:11.604 --> 02:55:13.157
LAURA: Oh, fuck you.

4383
02:55:13.157 --> 02:55:15.273
Three points of radiant damage.

4384
02:55:15.273 --> 02:55:17.609
MATT: Three points of radiant damage.

4385
02:55:17.609 --> 02:55:20.053
It burns up its side, it hurts
more, but it's still standing.

4386
02:55:20.053 --> 02:55:21.787
LAURA: Fuck, sorry, I didn't know which ones

4387
02:55:21.787 --> 02:55:22.733
that you got, Fjord.

4388
02:55:22.733 --> 02:55:24.221
I thought that was one of the ones you got.

4389
02:55:24.221 --> 02:55:25.336
MATT: He got Caleb's and Caduceus's.

4390
02:55:25.336 --> 02:55:27.234
LAURA: Oh, still?

4391
02:55:27.234 --> 02:55:28.775
Fuck.

4392
02:55:28.775 --> 02:55:30.103
MATT: That finishes your go, Jester?

4393
02:55:30.103 --> 02:55:31.786
LAURA: Oh, I'm going to move.

4394
02:55:31.786 --> 02:55:34.048
MATT: Yeah, where you going to move?

4395
02:55:34.048 --> 02:55:36.873
LAURA: I'm going to get closer to Beau and Caleb.

4396
02:55:36.873 --> 02:55:39.882
MATT: (counting) 25, 30. You can get up to there.

4397
02:55:39.882 --> 02:55:40.715
LAURA: Okay.

4398
02:55:40.715 --> 02:55:42.361
MATT: Okay, that finishes your go.

4399
02:55:42.361 --> 02:55:44.778
Caduceus, you're up. Nott, you're on deck.

4400
02:55:46.853 --> 02:55:48.128
TALIESIN: Okay.

4401
02:55:49.989 --> 02:55:54.298
I'm going to try to use my Staff of Withering

4402
02:55:55.246 --> 02:55:57.805
to hit the one that's holding me. Can I do that?

4403
02:55:58.847 --> 02:56:01.431
MATT: You can if you want to, yeah.

4404
02:56:01.431 --> 02:56:03.239
TALIESIN: I'm not going to do necrotic damage, though,

4405
02:56:03.239 --> 02:56:07.122
because I don't trust that it's
going to actually hurt this guy.

4406
02:56:08.808 --> 02:56:10.457
SAM: It's driving me mad.

4407
02:56:10.457 --> 02:56:12.362
TALIESIN: I know it's really hard to pay attention.

4408
02:56:12.362 --> 02:56:13.945
SAM: A telltale heart.

4409
02:56:16.516 --> 02:56:18.285
LAURA: (blowing raspberry)

4410
02:56:18.285 --> 02:56:21.176
It really is making me feel like I've got to poop.

4411
02:56:21.176 --> 02:56:22.525
(laughter)

4412
02:56:22.525 --> 02:56:24.108
TALIESIN: 17 to hit?

4413
02:56:24.980 --> 02:56:26.085
MATT: I'm sorry.

4414
02:56:26.085 --> 02:56:27.930
You want me to turn it off?

4415
02:56:27.930 --> 02:56:29.585
LIAM: Is it like your colon is pulsing?

4416
02:56:29.585 --> 02:56:30.463
LAURA: Yeah.

4417
02:56:30.463 --> 02:56:32.188
MATT: Do you want me to turn it off?
Is it making you uncomfortable?

4418
02:56:32.188 --> 02:56:33.079
LIAM: No way!

4419
02:56:33.079 --> 02:56:34.597
LIAM and TALIESIN: You got to leave it on.

4420
02:56:34.597 --> 02:56:37.049
LAURA: It's supposed to make us uncomfortable.

4421
02:56:37.049 --> 02:56:38.099
TALIESIN: 17 to hit?

4422
02:56:38.099 --> 02:56:40.501
MATT: 17 to hit, yeah, that hit him.

4423
02:56:40.501 --> 02:56:41.334
TALIESIN: Okay.

4424
02:56:43.657 --> 02:56:45.490
MATT: Oh wait. Is this with your staff, your melee staff?

4425
02:56:45.490 --> 02:56:46.323
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4426
02:56:46.323 --> 02:56:47.790
MATT: You're not within melee range.

4427
02:56:47.790 --> 02:56:49.408
TALIESIN: Oh, so nevermind.
MATT: It's holding you at a 10-foot distance.

4428
02:56:49.408 --> 02:56:51.713
TALIESIN: All right, so that's fine,
I will do something else, then.

4429
02:56:51.713 --> 02:56:52.546
MATT: Sorry.

4430
02:56:52.546 --> 02:56:55.463
LAURA: Oh, so you can't hit the part
that's holding onto him?

4431
02:56:55.463 --> 02:56:57.649
MATT: Right now, as it's holding out of the way,

4432
02:56:57.649 --> 02:56:58.928
and he can't quite--

4433
02:56:58.928 --> 02:57:01.291
TALIESIN: I'm going to try Sacred Flame, then.

4434
02:57:01.291 --> 02:57:03.528
MATT: Okay, dexterity check.

4435
02:57:03.528 --> 02:57:05.572
That is going to be a 12.

4436
02:57:05.572 --> 02:57:06.405
TALIESIN: That misses.

4437
02:57:06.405 --> 02:57:07.363
MATT: Go ahead and roll.

4438
02:57:07.363 --> 02:57:08.636
TALIESIN: (groans)

4439
02:57:08.636 --> 02:57:12.303
Okay, where did my d8s go? There they are.

4440
02:57:14.457 --> 02:57:16.868
15, 20 points of radiant damage.

4441
02:57:16.868 --> 02:57:19.793
MATT: The tentacle burns away, drawing to the ground,

4442
02:57:19.793 --> 02:57:21.468
darkening its form

4443
02:57:21.468 --> 02:57:25.668
as it is left a cindering extension
of the Permaheart.

4444
02:57:27.009 --> 02:57:30.266
TALIESIN: Then can I still cast a spell as a bonus action?

4445
02:57:30.266 --> 02:57:32.656
Since that was technically a cantrip?

4446
02:57:32.656 --> 02:57:33.840
MATT: Yeah, you can.

4447
02:57:33.840 --> 02:57:38.840
TALIESIN: I'm going to do a Mass Healing--

4448
02:57:39.308 --> 02:57:40.785
Should I do Mass Healing Word or should I--

4449
02:57:40.785 --> 02:57:42.732
LIAM: Watch those arms, watch those arms!

4450
02:57:42.732 --> 02:57:43.739
Come on!

4451
02:57:43.739 --> 02:57:46.133
LIAM: Well, the thing is, if I hit everyone

4452
02:57:46.133 --> 02:57:48.684
with a Mass Cure Wounds--
LAURA: Oh, but--

4453
02:57:48.684 --> 02:57:51.163
TALIESIN: I can't get everybody, though, there.

4454
02:57:51.163 --> 02:57:53.878
LAURA: Oh, well I would do Mass Cure Wounds, honestly.

4455
02:57:53.878 --> 02:57:56.212
TALIESIN: I'll do Mass Healing Word.

4456
02:57:56.212 --> 02:57:57.121
MATT: Okay.

4457
02:57:57.121 --> 02:57:59.107
TALIESIN: Mass Healing Word--

4458
02:57:59.107 --> 02:58:00.742
MATT: You can't quite see Caleb, you'd have to move a bit

4459
02:58:00.742 --> 02:58:02.231
to probably get a view of everybody.

4460
02:58:02.231 --> 02:58:06.045
TALIESIN: I think it's just 60 feet in any direction, right?

4461
02:58:06.045 --> 02:58:08.128
MATT: Any direction? It doesn't say you have to see them?

4462
02:58:08.128 --> 02:58:10.066
TALIESIN: I will get there in a second.
LAURA: I'm looking.

4463
02:58:10.066 --> 02:58:13.857
Yeah, "see within range," so you can
shimmy and see Caleb, too.

4464
02:58:13.857 --> 02:58:14.995
TALIESIN: Okay, I'll shimmy.

4465
02:58:14.995 --> 02:58:16.191
MATT: Slight movement, you can move there

4466
02:58:16.191 --> 02:58:17.183
and you can see everybody.

4467
02:58:17.183 --> 02:58:18.190
TALIESIN: Okay.

4468
02:58:18.190 --> 02:58:19.176
MATT: Okay.

4469
02:58:21.102 --> 02:58:22.554
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'll do it there.

4470
02:58:22.554 --> 02:58:23.520
Where's my Mass Healing Word?

4471
02:58:23.520 --> 02:58:24.375
I'm so sorry, I'm so--

4472
02:58:24.375 --> 02:58:25.410
LAURA: That's okay, it's right here.

4473
02:58:25.410 --> 02:58:27.167
MATT: It's okay. Nott, you're up next.

4474
02:58:27.167 --> 02:58:30.245
TALIESIN: Mass Healing Word, third level? Thank you.

4475
02:58:30.245 --> 02:58:32.245
That's going to be...

4476
02:58:34.962 --> 02:58:38.938
That's not a lot of healing, but everyone gets, oh!

4477
02:58:38.938 --> 02:58:40.075
LAURA: That's good.

4478
02:58:40.075 --> 02:58:42.276
TALIESIN: Nine points of healing to everybody.

4479
02:58:42.276 --> 02:58:43.572
MATT: Everyone heals nine points.

4480
02:58:43.572 --> 02:58:44.819
SAM: Including me?

4481
02:58:44.819 --> 02:58:45.701
TALIESIN: Including you.

4482
02:58:45.701 --> 02:58:46.708
SAM: There's not a range of something?

4483
02:58:46.708 --> 02:58:47.729
TALIESIN: 60 feet.

4484
02:58:47.729 --> 02:58:48.937
MATT: Nott's just out of range.

4485
02:58:48.937 --> 02:58:52.167
TALIESIN: Okay, because I moved that--

4486
02:58:52.167 --> 02:58:53.328
MATT: I could say, if you wanted to,

4487
02:58:53.328 --> 02:58:55.454
you could've moved over here with your full movement,

4488
02:58:55.454 --> 02:58:56.333
I'll allow that.

4489
02:58:56.333 --> 02:58:57.311
SAM: Nine, you said nine points?

4490
02:58:57.311 --> 02:58:59.570
TALIESIN: Nine points.
SAM: Oh, that's great. That's glorious.

4491
02:59:01.670 --> 02:59:03.366
That's a whole round of pulse damage.

4492
02:59:03.366 --> 02:59:04.608
LIAM: I'm up to half, guys.

4493
02:59:04.608 --> 02:59:06.990
MATT: Get you about there.
TALIESIN: There, that'll do.

4494
02:59:06.990 --> 02:59:08.890
TRAVIS: Also, we should take into account

4495
02:59:08.890 --> 02:59:10.386
that with all the glyphs on the cover,

4496
02:59:10.386 --> 02:59:12.481
if we break the cover, that necrotic pulse

4497
02:59:12.481 --> 02:59:15.398
might be, I don't know--
MARISHA: Real bad?

4498
02:59:17.457 --> 02:59:18.415
MATT: Regardless, Caduceus, your turn's over,

4499
02:59:18.415 --> 02:59:19.805
Nott, you're up.

4500
02:59:19.805 --> 02:59:21.110
LAURA: You can do this, you're so smart,

4501
02:59:21.110 --> 02:59:23.405
your investigation is so high.

4502
02:59:23.405 --> 02:59:27.650
SAM: I'm going to take out my magnifying
glass and look again.

4503
02:59:27.650 --> 02:59:28.483
LAURA: Yeah!

4504
02:59:28.483 --> 02:59:30.284
MATT: Make an investigation or arcana check.

4505
02:59:30.284 --> 02:59:31.699
TALIESIN: Trying to get over there.

4506
02:59:31.699 --> 02:59:33.853
SAM: 25.
LAURA: Yeah!

4507
02:59:33.853 --> 02:59:34.686
MATT: 25.

4508
02:59:36.404 --> 02:59:38.746
As you're staring at this, you can see

4509
02:59:38.746 --> 02:59:40.643
the parts you were missing of the pattern last round,

4510
02:59:40.643 --> 02:59:43.568
and you pull out your Dagger of Denial and get in there

4511
02:59:43.568 --> 02:59:46.829
and begin to carve through and deface the glyph

4512
02:59:46.829 --> 02:59:48.983
in the one spot where you see it's weakest.

4513
02:59:48.983 --> 02:59:52.556
As you do, you watch the energy cycle of it break.

4514
02:59:52.556 --> 02:59:56.176
The glyph goes dark, and the glass container,

4515
02:59:56.176 --> 02:59:59.528
the glyphs flash, and then darken even further.

4516
02:59:59.528 --> 03:00:01.471
LAURA: Nott did it, Nott got one of the glyphs!

4517
03:00:01.471 --> 03:00:04.862
SAM: I did it! I'm smarter than Beau and Caleb put together!

4518
03:00:04.862 --> 03:00:06.308
(laughter)

4519
03:00:06.308 --> 03:00:08.735
MARISHA: I got the first one, you dipshit.

4520
03:00:08.735 --> 03:00:10.985
TRAVIS: (laughs)

4521
03:00:12.023 --> 03:00:14.429
SAM: Wait, is Caleb the dumbest one now?

4522
03:00:14.429 --> 03:00:17.170
MARISHA: Woo! Girl power!

4523
03:00:17.170 --> 03:00:18.178
SAM: Girl power!

4524
03:00:18.178 --> 03:00:22.003
Bonus action disengage, run all the way towards Caleb.

4525
03:00:22.840 --> 03:00:24.039
LAURA: Clustering.

4526
03:00:24.039 --> 03:00:25.639
SAM: Yes.

4527
03:00:25.639 --> 03:00:26.972
TALIESIN: We should cluster right now.

4528
03:00:26.972 --> 03:00:28.740
MATT: You have your movement, too,
if you want to get closer.

4529
03:00:28.740 --> 03:00:29.970
TALIESIN: If we get in there, we need everybody.

4530
03:00:29.970 --> 03:00:31.791
SAM: No, I bonus action disengaged.

4531
03:00:31.791 --> 03:00:33.685
MATT: Oh, got you, right, right, sorry.

4532
03:00:33.685 --> 03:00:34.924
So yeah, you're good.

4533
03:00:34.924 --> 03:00:37.298
That ends your turn. Beau, you're up, Caleb, you're on deck.

4534
03:00:37.298 --> 03:00:41.073
MARISHA: Okay. Can I help him again?

4535
03:00:41.073 --> 03:00:42.067
MATT: Yeah.

4536
03:00:42.067 --> 03:00:44.434
MARISHA: Okay, here's actually what I want to do.

4537
03:00:44.434 --> 03:00:48.824
Can I be like: sorry, excuse me, sorry, sorry,
and move here.

4538
03:00:48.824 --> 03:00:50.578
MATT: Sure.

4539
03:00:50.578 --> 03:00:52.429
You have to be right up against it to help him.

4540
03:00:52.429 --> 03:00:54.808
You can move back and use your action, if you want to.

4541
03:00:54.808 --> 03:00:56.770
But in order for you to help him, you both have to be

4542
03:00:56.770 --> 03:00:58.021
right up against the glyph.

4543
03:00:58.021 --> 03:00:58.888
MARISHA: Am I not right against him?

4544
03:00:58.888 --> 03:01:00.520
I can't see from this angle, so bear with me.

4545
03:01:00.520 --> 03:01:01.702
MATT: Right, the glyph is in the middle,

4546
03:01:01.702 --> 03:01:03.130
the only way you can reach it is by having

4547
03:01:03.130 --> 03:01:06.040
any of the spaces that Caleb and you previously had.

4548
03:01:06.040 --> 03:01:09.091
That's the only way to be able to help him with this.

4549
03:01:09.091 --> 03:01:10.882
MARISHA: Nevermind.

4550
03:01:10.882 --> 03:01:14.005
I will hold my action to help.

4551
03:01:14.005 --> 03:01:15.688
MATT: Or use your action to help him.

4552
03:01:15.688 --> 03:01:16.817
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4553
03:01:16.817 --> 03:01:18.349
MATT: Okay, you got it.

4554
03:01:18.349 --> 03:01:20.900
Caleb, you're up.

4555
03:01:20.900 --> 03:01:22.520
SAM: I believe in you, Caleb.

4556
03:01:22.520 --> 03:01:24.765
MATT: Investigation or arcana if you're going to do this.

4557
03:01:24.765 --> 03:01:26.529
LIAM: Jester, I need you.

4558
03:01:26.529 --> 03:01:28.290
I'm going to hold my action and wait

4559
03:01:28.290 --> 03:01:30.622
and hope that she guides me.

4560
03:01:30.622 --> 03:01:32.794
MARISHA: I think Caduceus was actually doing that, too.

4561
03:01:32.794 --> 03:01:33.990
TALIESIN: I've got to get there.

4562
03:01:33.990 --> 03:01:36.347
LIAM: He's got to touch me. Jester's next.

4563
03:01:36.347 --> 03:01:37.730
Anyway, I just said what I said.

4564
03:01:37.730 --> 03:01:38.932
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: I'm holding.

4565
03:01:38.932 --> 03:01:40.837
MATT: You're holding your action to investigate

4566
03:01:40.837 --> 03:01:43.629
with Beau's help once Jester gets to you. All right.

4567
03:01:43.629 --> 03:01:45.560
Ending your turn, it is now the Permaheart's turn.

4568
03:01:45.560 --> 03:01:47.967
Everybody in the chamber suffers six points

4569
03:01:47.967 --> 03:01:51.468
of necrotic damage as the wave arcs out once more

4570
03:01:51.468 --> 03:01:53.083
with the beat of the heart.

4571
03:01:53.083 --> 03:01:54.795
SAM: The poop gets closer.

4572
03:01:54.795 --> 03:01:59.093
MATT: It does summon one tendril, which is going to be

4573
03:01:59.093 --> 03:02:03.085
right there, and then it's going to see if it--

4574
03:02:04.062 --> 03:02:07.296
it fails to recharge its Summon Tendrils ability,

4575
03:02:07.296 --> 03:02:09.688
so that's what the tendril gets out this turn.

4576
03:02:09.688 --> 03:02:12.605
This one's going to go ahead and move.

4577
03:02:15.711 --> 03:02:17.789
Can get there and then be within range of both

4578
03:02:17.789 --> 03:02:19.100
Caduceus and--

4579
03:02:19.100 --> 03:02:20.691
LAURA: Stupid little Mage Hand is just sitting there.

4580
03:02:20.691 --> 03:02:23.098
SAM: Yeah, it wasn't very useful this fight, but it's there.

4581
03:02:23.098 --> 03:02:24.744
LIAM: Wait, am I held in a tentacle now?

4582
03:02:24.744 --> 03:02:25.843
MATT: Yeah, you're still grappled.

4583
03:02:25.843 --> 03:02:26.676
LIAM: Yeah.

4584
03:02:26.676 --> 03:02:28.688
MATT: You're holding hands up against it.

4585
03:02:28.688 --> 03:02:31.068
MARISHA: (laughs)

4586
03:02:31.068 --> 03:02:32.518
LIAM: Just looking at it.

4587
03:02:32.518 --> 03:02:34.061
MARISHA: I'm just like, come on, focus.

4588
03:02:34.061 --> 03:02:36.367
Come on, we got to solve this puzzle.

4589
03:02:36.367 --> 03:02:39.355
MATT: That's an attack. It's going to attack you,

4590
03:02:39.355 --> 03:02:41.061
as it currently has you held, one's going to be

4591
03:02:41.061 --> 03:02:42.021
attacking you, Jester, and one's going to be

4592
03:02:42.021 --> 03:02:43.520
attacking Caduceus again.

4593
03:02:43.520 --> 03:02:44.742
SAM: The Mage Hand's gone, by the way.

4594
03:02:44.742 --> 03:02:45.575
MATT: Oh.

4595
03:02:45.575 --> 03:02:46.408
SAM: I got hit so many times.
LIAM: Oh, I'm going to tell

4596
03:02:46.408 --> 03:02:47.758
Willi to do something, too.

4597
03:02:48.648 --> 03:02:50.492
MATT: Sure, yeah.
LIAM: Sorry.

4598
03:02:50.492 --> 03:02:52.666
Light them up, pretty.

4599
03:02:52.666 --> 03:02:54.903
And Willi is going to walk around

4600
03:02:54.903 --> 03:02:58.079
to that side of that tentacle.

4601
03:02:58.079 --> 03:03:00.912
A straight line here to here.

4602
03:03:00.912 --> 03:03:03.449
He's going to belch lightning through these two tentacles.

4603
03:03:03.449 --> 03:03:04.457
MATT: Okay.

4604
03:03:04.457 --> 03:03:08.474
You watch Willi walk around to the side,

4605
03:03:08.474 --> 03:03:11.558
grab and open the central part of the chest,

4606
03:03:11.558 --> 03:03:14.928
this bright blue light begins to crackle, and then

4607
03:03:14.928 --> 03:03:17.887
a beam of lightning is firing out of Willi's chest.

4608
03:03:17.887 --> 03:03:18.952
SAM: What?

4609
03:03:18.952 --> 03:03:20.928
MATT: What's the save on that?

4610
03:03:20.928 --> 03:03:23.024
LIAM: It's a 14 dex.

4611
03:03:23.024 --> 03:03:25.002
MATT: 14 dex. Okay.

4612
03:03:28.361 --> 03:03:30.061
Okay, since the order got a little weird here,

4613
03:03:30.061 --> 03:03:31.807
I'll say because you moved Willi over there,

4614
03:03:31.807 --> 03:03:33.115
had him hold his action, do the lightning

4615
03:03:33.115 --> 03:03:35.438
when the other tendril went up, sure.

4616
03:03:35.438 --> 03:03:36.271
Because he was a little out of order.

4617
03:03:36.271 --> 03:03:37.392
LIAM: We could just do one.
MATT: That's fine.

4618
03:03:37.392 --> 03:03:39.065
LIAM: I don't want to--

4619
03:03:39.065 --> 03:03:41.758
MATT: Roll damage, and it's a dexterity saving throw.

4620
03:03:41.758 --> 03:03:43.346
SAM: Oof.

4621
03:03:43.346 --> 03:03:45.538
MATT: Eight, and 17.

4622
03:03:46.429 --> 03:03:47.703
LIAM: 31.

4623
03:03:47.703 --> 03:03:50.520
MATT: 31, so eight and 17, what's the DC on it?

4624
03:03:50.520 --> 03:03:51.353
LIAM: 14.

4625
03:03:51.353 --> 03:03:53.295
MATT: 14, so this is a failure.

4626
03:03:54.145 --> 03:03:55.969
That one is incinerated by the bolt of lightning.

4627
03:03:55.969 --> 03:03:57.431
You are no longer grappled, Caleb.

4628
03:03:57.431 --> 03:04:00.139
TRAVIS: Nice!
LAURA: Yay!

4629
03:04:00.139 --> 03:04:03.264
MATT: This one does take half damage.

4630
03:04:03.264 --> 03:04:04.530
TRAVIS: 15?

4631
03:04:06.281 --> 03:04:07.222
MATT: Which is 15 points lightning damage,

4632
03:04:07.222 --> 03:04:09.528
but it's still standing.

4633
03:04:09.528 --> 03:04:11.565
All right, so that finishes his go.

4634
03:04:11.565 --> 03:04:14.183
That's only an attack against Caduceus and Jester.

4635
03:04:14.183 --> 03:04:15.763
Against Caduceus...

4636
03:04:15.763 --> 03:04:17.900
that is going to be a 14 to hit.

4637
03:04:17.900 --> 03:04:20.195
TALIESIN: Nope.
MATT: Misses, and against Jester,

4638
03:04:20.195 --> 03:04:23.710
that is going to be a 23 to hit.
LAURA: Yep, yep, yep.

4639
03:04:23.710 --> 03:04:26.593
MATT: You take 13 points of bludgeoning damage.

4640
03:04:26.593 --> 03:04:28.139
I need you to make a strength saving throw.

4641
03:04:28.139 --> 03:04:29.318
TALIESIN: With a d4.

4642
03:04:29.318 --> 03:04:31.371
SAM: Come on, come on, strong girl.

4643
03:04:31.371 --> 03:04:33.663
LAURA: (unsure humming)

4644
03:04:33.663 --> 03:04:35.047
SAM: Be mighty.

4645
03:04:35.047 --> 03:04:36.797
LAURA: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

4646
03:04:38.867 --> 03:04:41.183
(regretful humming) 10.

4647
03:04:41.183 --> 03:04:43.248
MATT: You are grappled.

4648
03:04:43.248 --> 03:04:44.357
LAURA: Sorry, Caleb.

4649
03:04:44.357 --> 03:04:45.949
Does that ruin his action completely,

4650
03:04:45.949 --> 03:04:48.276
or does he get to take it even though I don't get to him?

4651
03:04:48.276 --> 03:04:49.983
MATT: I guess in seeing that you can't get there,

4652
03:04:49.983 --> 03:04:51.158
I'd allow him to use it at that point.

4653
03:04:51.158 --> 03:04:53.399
LAURA: Okay.

4654
03:04:53.399 --> 03:04:55.165
MATT: Investigation or arcana, your choice.

4655
03:04:55.165 --> 03:04:56.990
LIAM: Investigation. They're equal.

4656
03:04:56.990 --> 03:04:58.190
MATT: With advantage.

4657
03:05:00.134 --> 03:05:02.191
LIAM: That one's cocked.
MATT: Eh.

4658
03:05:02.191 --> 03:05:04.815
LIAM: What is it, a six or a nine?

4659
03:05:04.815 --> 03:05:05.965
It's cocked.

4660
03:05:05.965 --> 03:05:07.245
MATT: Can you put a die on it?

4661
03:05:07.245 --> 03:05:08.232
LIAM: No.

4662
03:05:08.232 --> 03:05:11.332
It's exactly equal, there's a razor edge facing up.

4663
03:05:11.332 --> 03:05:13.449
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll it again.

4664
03:05:15.806 --> 03:05:17.302
LIAM: 24.

4665
03:05:17.302 --> 03:05:18.937
MATT: 24.

4666
03:05:18.937 --> 03:05:20.692
It's still eluding you.

4667
03:05:20.692 --> 03:05:22.156
It's right on the cusp.

4668
03:05:22.156 --> 03:05:25.182
You can see it, that final little moment,

4669
03:05:25.182 --> 03:05:27.241
that final little element of it, you can't quite discern.

4670
03:05:27.241 --> 03:05:29.167
SAM: I'll throw him my magnifying glass!

4671
03:05:29.167 --> 03:05:30.926
MATT: All right.
LIAM: I needed Jester.

4672
03:05:30.926 --> 03:05:32.627
LAURA: Sorry.
MATT: Fjord, your turn.

4673
03:05:32.627 --> 03:05:33.460
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4674
03:05:34.557 --> 03:05:36.809
(sighs)

4675
03:05:36.809 --> 03:05:41.238
I'm going to whale away with the glowing Star Razor

4676
03:05:41.238 --> 03:05:43.433
at the cage holding the heart.

4677
03:05:43.433 --> 03:05:45.442
MATT: Go for it.

4678
03:05:45.442 --> 03:05:46.725
TRAVIS: Okay.

4679
03:05:47.879 --> 03:05:48.877
Ugh.

4680
03:05:48.877 --> 03:05:50.747
One of those is a 13.
MATT: Misses.

4681
03:05:50.747 --> 03:05:54.590
TRAVIS: Oh, well yeah, it doesn't matter the d4, 14.

4682
03:05:54.590 --> 03:05:56.816
The second one is monstrous.

4683
03:05:56.816 --> 03:06:01.577
That's a 30, 33.

4684
03:06:01.577 --> 03:06:04.877
MATT: 33, that definitely hits, go ahead and roll damage.

4685
03:06:07.044 --> 03:06:08.627
TRAVIS: Eight, 15.

4686
03:06:10.369 --> 03:06:13.969
17 points of slashing damage.

4687
03:06:13.969 --> 03:06:15.573
MATT: 17 points of slashing damage.

4688
03:06:15.573 --> 03:06:17.851
The first one just spins across it,

4689
03:06:17.851 --> 03:06:20.011
a bit of the glass streaking a bit,

4690
03:06:20.011 --> 03:06:22.439
but no actual damage. You strike across a second time,

4691
03:06:22.439 --> 03:06:24.600
and as you cut, you see the glass (cracking).

4692
03:06:24.600 --> 03:06:25.482
SAM: Ooh.

4693
03:06:25.482 --> 03:06:28.356
MATT: Breaking a little bit, a little
crack spider around the side.

4694
03:06:28.356 --> 03:06:30.027
It's taken some hits.

4695
03:06:30.027 --> 03:06:32.144
TRAVIS: I'm within the melee range of that tentacle, right?

4696
03:06:32.144 --> 03:06:33.269
MATT: You are.
TRAVIS: I will stay put.

4697
03:06:33.269 --> 03:06:35.232
MATT: All right, finishing Fjord's go, Jester, you're up,

4698
03:06:35.232 --> 03:06:37.116
Caduceus, you're on deck.

4699
03:06:37.116 --> 03:06:39.066
LAURA: I'm going to...

4700
03:06:43.279 --> 03:06:46.117
Jeez, I'm running out of spells here.

4701
03:06:46.117 --> 03:06:49.430
TRAVIS: There's no breaks in the cage surrounding the heart,

4702
03:06:49.430 --> 03:06:50.978
right, there's no open sections?

4703
03:06:50.978 --> 03:06:51.986
MATT: No.

4704
03:06:53.340 --> 03:06:54.657
TRAVIS: It's gone through the ground and then come up?

4705
03:06:54.657 --> 03:06:58.730
LAURA: I know, it's just if I want
to keep attacking the thingy.

4706
03:06:59.580 --> 03:07:02.120
Okay, yeah, I'm going to use my Spiritual Weapon

4707
03:07:02.120 --> 03:07:04.209
against the tendril holding onto me.

4708
03:07:04.209 --> 03:07:05.841
MATT: Go for it.

4709
03:07:05.841 --> 03:07:07.449
SAM: (like Jester) "To me."

4710
03:07:09.148 --> 03:07:09.981
LAURA: 23.

4711
03:07:11.294 --> 03:07:14.232
MATT: Plus a d4, because you are blessed.

4712
03:07:15.223 --> 03:07:16.548
LAURA: Four, so 27.

4713
03:07:16.548 --> 03:07:17.381
MATT: 27 hits.

4714
03:07:17.381 --> 03:07:19.213
Oh, and do make a constitution saving throw for me,

4715
03:07:19.213 --> 03:07:20.691
by the way, just to make sure you maintain--

4716
03:07:20.691 --> 03:07:23.424
LAURA: <i>Do</i> make a constitution saving throw for me.

4717
03:07:23.424 --> 03:07:24.875
MATT: Yeah, you're fine.
TALIESIN: Yay!

4718
03:07:24.875 --> 03:07:28.192
MATT: So Bless is maintained. So you do hit with it.

4719
03:07:28.192 --> 03:07:30.186
LAURA: 12 plus five, 17.

4720
03:07:30.186 --> 03:07:32.144
MATT: 17 points of damage, nice.

4721
03:07:32.144 --> 03:07:34.008
TALIESIN: This one already took lightning damage, too.

4722
03:07:34.008 --> 03:07:36.505
LAURA: Oh, that's true.

4723
03:07:36.505 --> 03:07:38.235
MATT: Well no, this is against the--

4724
03:07:38.235 --> 03:07:39.917
LAURA: Oh no, I had said it was against the tendril.

4725
03:07:39.917 --> 03:07:41.380
MATT: Oh, the tendril, nevermind.

4726
03:07:41.380 --> 03:07:43.228
LAURA: I know, sorry.

4727
03:07:43.228 --> 03:07:44.854
MATT: No worries.

4728
03:07:44.854 --> 03:07:47.521
Against that one there. Moves over, strikes it.

4729
03:07:48.617 --> 03:07:50.250
That one is splattered onto the ground.

4730
03:07:50.250 --> 03:07:51.278
TRAVIS: Amazing!
SAM: Free to move.

4731
03:07:51.278 --> 03:07:53.166
TRAVIS: The serrated lollipop!

4732
03:07:53.166 --> 03:07:54.988
MARISHA: Was that a bonus action?

4733
03:07:54.988 --> 03:07:56.734
LAURA: That was a bonus action.

4734
03:07:56.734 --> 03:07:57.722
MATT: Yep.

4735
03:07:57.722 --> 03:08:02.439
LAURA: So yeah, for my-- oof.

4736
03:08:03.677 --> 03:08:07.826
For my action, I'm going to run over and

4737
03:08:07.826 --> 03:08:10.218
cast Bless on...

4738
03:08:10.218 --> 03:08:11.325
MATT: Bless?

4739
03:08:11.325 --> 03:08:13.416
LAURA: No, Guidance, I'm going to cast Guidance.

4740
03:08:13.416 --> 03:08:15.328
SAM and MARISHA: (pigeon cooing) Guidance!

4741
03:08:15.328 --> 03:08:17.359
LAURA: On Caleb.

4742
03:08:17.359 --> 03:08:20.017
I'm going to drop-- I know it's a concentration,

4743
03:08:20.017 --> 03:08:22.211
so I'll drop Bless on everybody that I had cast it on.

4744
03:08:22.211 --> 03:08:23.218
MATT: Which was?

4745
03:08:23.218 --> 03:08:27.768
LAURA: Me, Caduceus, and Caleb, actually.

4746
03:08:30.679 --> 03:08:32.417
TALIESIN: Figure it doesn't help with this, so.

4747
03:08:32.417 --> 03:08:33.517
LAURA: Yeah.

4748
03:08:33.517 --> 03:08:35.934
MATT: All right, Bless fails.

4749
03:08:37.536 --> 03:08:39.648
MARISHA: I mean, that's the best thing we can do, really.

4750
03:08:39.648 --> 03:08:41.729
MATT: Caduceus, you're up. Nott, you're on deck.

4751
03:08:41.729 --> 03:08:46.146
TALIESIN: I'm going to attack the tendril behind me.

4752
03:08:47.335 --> 03:08:49.726
MARISHA: Third time's the charm.

4753
03:08:49.726 --> 03:08:53.890
TALIESIN: I'm going to attack the
tendril behind me with a Sacred Flame.

4754
03:08:53.890 --> 03:08:56.102
MATT: All righty.

4755
03:08:56.102 --> 03:08:57.622
MATT: Natural 20 on the saving throw.

4756
03:08:57.622 --> 03:08:58.720
SAM: Ooh.

4757
03:08:58.720 --> 03:09:00.649
TALIESIN: I don't like you.
MATT: Sorry.

4758
03:09:00.649 --> 03:09:02.614
TRAVIS: (laughs) He didn't mean it.

4759
03:09:02.614 --> 03:09:04.155
TALIESIN: I can see everybody right now, can't I?

4760
03:09:04.155 --> 03:09:04.988
MATT: Yeah.

4761
03:09:04.988 --> 03:09:07.018
TALIESIN: I'm just going to heal everybody again.

4762
03:09:07.018 --> 03:09:08.007
MATT: Another Mass Healing Word?

4763
03:09:08.007 --> 03:09:11.614
TALIESIN: I'm going to do another Mass Healing Word.

4764
03:09:11.614 --> 03:09:13.075
MATT: Go for it.

4765
03:09:13.075 --> 03:09:15.464
MARISHA: Getting anxiety attack with heartbeats.

4766
03:09:15.464 --> 03:09:17.407
TALIESIN: That's nine more points of healing to everybody.

4767
03:09:17.407 --> 03:09:19.369
MATT: Nine points to everybody.

4768
03:09:19.369 --> 03:09:20.665
MARISHA: That's good.

4769
03:09:20.665 --> 03:09:22.510
LAURA: Oh, that's great, this is good, this is good.

4770
03:09:22.510 --> 03:09:24.705
SAM: It feels like if we stay in this fight long enough,

4771
03:09:24.705 --> 03:09:26.182
we're going to be back to full health.

4772
03:09:26.182 --> 03:09:28.096
(laughter)

4773
03:09:28.096 --> 03:09:29.411
MATT: Caduceus, that finish your turn?

4774
03:09:29.411 --> 03:09:31.572
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm just going to just keep an eye

4775
03:09:31.572 --> 03:09:32.933
on that bloody thing, yeah.

4776
03:09:32.933 --> 03:09:34.226
MATT: All right, Nott, you're up. Beau, you're on deck.

4777
03:09:34.226 --> 03:09:37.204
SAM: I'm up?
MATT: Yeah.

4778
03:09:37.204 --> 03:09:39.287
SAM: I'll run over to Caleb.

4779
03:09:41.833 --> 03:09:44.887
MARISHA: (whispering) We need buffs.

4780
03:09:44.887 --> 03:09:46.845
SAM: Take out my magnifying glass,

4781
03:09:46.845 --> 03:09:48.591
and I will investigate the glyph.

4782
03:09:48.591 --> 03:09:50.643
MATT: Unfortunately, you are not close enough.

4783
03:09:50.643 --> 03:09:53.230
They're both taking up the space that is

4784
03:09:53.230 --> 03:09:54.376
directly adjacent to it.
SAM: Okay.

4785
03:09:54.376 --> 03:09:56.537
MATT: They're up against it, you cannot do it yourself,

4786
03:09:56.537 --> 03:09:57.817
unless one of them moves.

4787
03:09:57.817 --> 03:09:58.984
MARISHA: Can you hand it to him?

4788
03:09:58.984 --> 03:10:02.207
SAM: I will hand you the magnifying glass.

4789
03:10:02.207 --> 03:10:03.336
And I will--

4790
03:10:03.336 --> 03:10:04.734
MATT: I'll say that's just an object use, it's for free.

4791
03:10:04.734 --> 03:10:07.638
SAM: I can't also help him.

4792
03:10:07.638 --> 03:10:10.154
MATT: It doesn't give him double advantage.

4793
03:10:11.716 --> 03:10:14.133
LAURA: You can shoot the fucking thing, yeah.

4794
03:10:14.133 --> 03:10:15.909
MARISHA: What's the magnifying glass do?

4795
03:10:15.909 --> 03:10:16.967
SAM: It looks cool.
LAURA: Nothing.

4796
03:10:16.967 --> 03:10:18.860
MARISHA: Oh.
LAURA: Shoot the glass.

4797
03:10:18.860 --> 03:10:20.086
SAM: It's a good luck charm.

4798
03:10:20.086 --> 03:10:22.020
I'll spin around and I'll-- should I shoot the tendril

4799
03:10:22.020 --> 03:10:22.853
or the glass?

4800
03:10:22.853 --> 03:10:25.165
LAURA: Shoot the fucking glass, I think. Either way.

4801
03:10:25.165 --> 03:10:27.515
SAM: Is the tendril engaged?

4802
03:10:27.515 --> 03:10:28.553
TALIESIN: Technically.

4803
03:10:28.553 --> 03:10:29.772
MATT: The tentacle right now is not--

4804
03:10:29.772 --> 03:10:31.505
it hasn't grappled anybody, but it is in combat

4805
03:10:31.505 --> 03:10:32.763
with both Caduceus within range.

4806
03:10:32.763 --> 03:10:34.308
SAM: Okay, I will attack the tendril.

4807
03:10:34.308 --> 03:10:35.266
MATT: Go for it.

4808
03:10:35.266 --> 03:10:36.460
SAM: Not great, 18.

4809
03:10:36.460 --> 03:10:37.577
MATT: 18 hits.

4810
03:10:37.577 --> 03:10:39.272
SAM: Sneak attack damage!

4811
03:10:39.272 --> 03:10:41.706
MATT: Does not get sneaky attacks
because nobody's adjacent to it.

4812
03:10:41.706 --> 03:10:43.162
LIAM: Crazy roll.

4813
03:10:43.162 --> 03:10:45.449
MARISHA: That was such a good roll.
MATT: I know.

4814
03:10:45.449 --> 03:10:50.276
SAM: Then it's just eight points of damage.

4815
03:10:50.276 --> 03:10:53.965
MATT: It takes the bolt, still standing, little wounded.

4816
03:10:53.965 --> 03:10:55.646
SAM: Bonus action attack it again.

4817
03:10:55.646 --> 03:10:56.966
28 to hit.

4818
03:10:56.966 --> 03:10:58.736
MATT: That hits, roll damage a second time.

4819
03:10:58.736 --> 03:11:00.117
SAM: Another eight points of damage.

4820
03:11:00.117 --> 03:11:01.414
MATT: Looking more wounded.

4821
03:11:01.414 --> 03:11:03.676
TALIESIN: Even after-- oh, that's right, I didn't hurt it.

4822
03:11:03.676 --> 03:11:04.990
MATT: Yeah, didn't hurt it.

4823
03:11:04.990 --> 03:11:06.983
All right, does that finish your turn Nott?

4824
03:11:06.983 --> 03:11:07.816
SAM: Yes.

4825
03:11:07.816 --> 03:11:09.894
MATT: All right, Beauregard, you're up.
Caleb, you're on deck.

4826
03:11:09.894 --> 03:11:12.451
MARISHA: Goddamn it, we're so fucking close.

4827
03:11:12.451 --> 03:11:14.012
We've gotten this wrong three times.

4828
03:11:14.012 --> 03:11:17.051
Okay, it's not that glyph, and it's not that glyph.

4829
03:11:17.051 --> 03:11:18.634
It's got to be that one, try it again!

4830
03:11:18.634 --> 03:11:20.862
LIAM: We're just in Vegas pulling that slot machine.

4831
03:11:20.862 --> 03:11:22.916
MATT: Yep, yep. That your turn?

4832
03:11:22.916 --> 03:11:25.352
MARISHA: I'm helping Caleb, I see that Jester

4833
03:11:25.352 --> 03:11:27.801
has given him a Guidance.

4834
03:11:27.801 --> 03:11:28.926
MATT: All right, Caleb.

4835
03:11:28.926 --> 03:11:30.228
SAM: Use the magnifying glass!

4836
03:11:30.228 --> 03:11:31.061
MATT: Caleb, your turn.

4837
03:11:31.061 --> 03:11:35.237
LIAM: I look through the magnifying
glass and inspect the glyph.

4838
03:11:35.237 --> 03:11:36.956
MARISHA: (sighs)

4839
03:11:36.956 --> 03:11:38.423
LIAM: That's cocked, but it's more of a two.

4840
03:11:38.423 --> 03:11:41.107
I'll take the two. It's more of a two.

4841
03:11:41.107 --> 03:11:43.188
That's a three, no, that's a five.

4842
03:11:43.188 --> 03:11:45.135
Plus three, that's seven.

4843
03:11:45.135 --> 03:11:47.081
SAM: Holy shit.

4844
03:11:47.081 --> 03:11:49.122
You were holding it backwards!

4845
03:11:49.122 --> 03:11:50.469
(laughter)

4846
03:11:50.469 --> 03:11:51.935
SAM: It's the other side!
LAURA: This is the wrong way,

4847
03:11:51.935 --> 03:11:53.026
the dice are telling us,

4848
03:11:53.026 --> 03:11:54.939
let's just fucking hit the glass!

4849
03:11:54.939 --> 03:11:56.652
TALIESIN: They can do that and the rest of us can--

4850
03:11:56.652 --> 03:11:58.133
MATT: That's your action, Caleb. You have movement

4851
03:11:58.133 --> 03:12:00.869
or you want to stay there?

4852
03:12:00.869 --> 03:12:02.861
LIAM: I'm going to stay, but I tell Willi

4853
03:12:02.861 --> 03:12:04.864
to beat the shit out of the glass.

4854
03:12:04.864 --> 03:12:06.447
MATT: All right.

4855
03:12:08.170 --> 03:12:10.544
MARISHA: How long does Guidance last?

4856
03:12:10.544 --> 03:12:11.549
MATT: One round.

4857
03:12:11.549 --> 03:12:12.382
MARISHA: Just one round?

4858
03:12:12.382 --> 03:12:14.623
LIAM: Yeah, that's a one timer.

4859
03:12:14.623 --> 03:12:15.470
LAURA: Yep.

4860
03:12:15.470 --> 03:12:20.111
LIAM: That's a 21 and a 22 to hit.

4861
03:12:20.111 --> 03:12:21.098
MATT: Both miss.

4862
03:12:21.098 --> 03:12:22.620
LIAM: Both miss on the glass?

4863
03:12:22.620 --> 03:12:25.877
MATT: It impacts, but they're not actually

4864
03:12:25.877 --> 03:12:27.573
doing any damage to it.

4865
03:12:27.573 --> 03:12:28.769
LIAM: Okay.

4866
03:12:28.769 --> 03:12:30.481
MATT: All right, that finishes your go.

4867
03:12:30.481 --> 03:12:33.130
Permaheart's turn.

4868
03:12:33.130 --> 03:12:36.640
Everyone takes six points of necrotic damage.

4869
03:12:36.640 --> 03:12:38.223
MARISHA: Swap in, swap in.

4870
03:12:40.034 --> 03:12:41.770
TRAVIS: That's a lot of sixes.

4871
03:12:41.770 --> 03:12:43.315
Almost triple sixes.
TALIESIN: Six points.

4872
03:12:43.315 --> 03:12:44.527
MATT: All right.

4873
03:12:44.527 --> 03:12:46.267
Was there something you're missing?

4874
03:12:46.267 --> 03:12:47.219
LAURA: No, no.

4875
03:12:47.219 --> 03:12:49.918
LIAM: No, we're just brainstorming.
TALIESIN: Having a brainstorm.

4876
03:12:49.918 --> 03:12:52.174
MATT: All right, so, everyone takes damage from that.

4877
03:12:52.174 --> 03:12:54.420
It does summon one additional tentacle.

4878
03:12:54.420 --> 03:12:55.789
This one's going to go ahead and--

4879
03:12:55.789 --> 03:12:57.945
SAM: Oh no.

4880
03:12:57.945 --> 03:12:59.740
MATT: -- appear there.

4881
03:12:59.740 --> 03:13:00.744
TALIESIN: Help.

4882
03:13:00.744 --> 03:13:02.165
MATT: Let's see if it restores its Summon Tendrils.

4883
03:13:02.165 --> 03:13:03.578
It does not.

4884
03:13:03.578 --> 03:13:05.198
Both of those, one of them is going to--

4885
03:13:05.198 --> 03:13:07.181
actually no, both of them are going to make
attacks against Caduceus.

4886
03:13:07.181 --> 03:13:09.460
LAURA: Why?
TALIESIN: Why?

4887
03:13:09.460 --> 03:13:10.560
LAURA: He's so nice.

4888
03:13:10.560 --> 03:13:12.515
MATT: Because he's the one who's healing everybody.

4889
03:13:12.515 --> 03:13:14.403
SAM: He's secretly a dick.

4890
03:13:14.403 --> 03:13:15.236
MATT: 14.

4891
03:13:16.475 --> 03:13:18.890
And 18.

4892
03:13:18.890 --> 03:13:19.723
TALIESIN: 18 is my AC.

4893
03:13:19.723 --> 03:13:21.972
MATT: So it just hits you.

4894
03:13:23.474 --> 03:13:26.251
That is nine, 12 points of bludgeoning damage.

4895
03:13:26.251 --> 03:13:27.418
TALIESIN: Gross.

4896
03:13:27.418 --> 03:13:29.318
MATT: I need you to make a strength saving throw for me.

4897
03:13:29.318 --> 03:13:32.880
LAURA: Oh no, and I dropped my Bless. I'm so sorry.

4898
03:13:32.880 --> 03:13:35.979
Caleb made me do it, and it was absolutely worthless.

4899
03:13:35.979 --> 03:13:37.779
MATT: Well, could have been really helpful.

4900
03:13:37.779 --> 03:13:40.100
TRAVIS: (laughs)

4901
03:13:40.100 --> 03:13:42.727
TALIESIN: Strength saving throw?
MATT: Mm-hmm.

4902
03:13:42.727 --> 03:13:44.688
TALIESIN: Anything could happen, but it doesn't.

4903
03:13:45.530 --> 03:13:46.865
MATT: You are grappled, Caduceus.

4904
03:13:46.865 --> 03:13:48.395
TALIESIN: Oh, not again.

4905
03:13:49.253 --> 03:13:51.280
MATT: It wraps in as the one down
here is the one that got you,

4906
03:13:51.280 --> 03:13:52.610
so you're currently held back that way.

4907
03:13:52.610 --> 03:13:54.958
TALIESIN: It's the one that's actually
hurt enough that I can, or someone will--

4908
03:13:54.958 --> 03:13:58.190
MATT: Finishing its go, Fjord, you're
up, with Jester on deck.

4909
03:13:58.190 --> 03:14:00.007
TRAVIS: I will turn to face the tentacle

4910
03:14:00.007 --> 03:14:02.216
that has ensnared Caduceus and I will take

4911
03:14:02.216 --> 03:14:03.979
the first strike with the Star Razor at it.

4912
03:14:03.979 --> 03:14:06.275
MATT: All right, so you move in here.

4913
03:14:06.275 --> 03:14:07.309
TRAVIS: I do.
MATT: Melee.

4914
03:14:07.309 --> 03:14:08.965
MARISHA: Stupid puzzle.

4915
03:14:08.965 --> 03:14:11.362
SAM: Puzzles are stupid and Matt's stupid, too!

4916
03:14:11.362 --> 03:14:12.253
TRAVIS: 21 to hit.

4917
03:14:12.253 --> 03:14:13.509
MATT: That hits, go ahead and roll damage.

4918
03:14:13.509 --> 03:14:15.410
LIAM: Our Matt is stupid, brain is stupid.

4919
03:14:15.410 --> 03:14:16.985
MATT: Sorry, guys.

4920
03:14:18.560 --> 03:14:20.570
TRAVIS: 17 points of slashing damage.

4921
03:14:20.570 --> 03:14:23.512
MATT: You cut Caduceus free right as it wraps

4922
03:14:23.512 --> 03:14:25.443
and pulls him up into the air, you immediately turn around

4923
03:14:25.443 --> 03:14:27.603
and the first hit carves through.

4924
03:14:27.603 --> 03:14:29.886
TRAVIS: Amazing. Can I use the rest of my

4925
03:14:29.886 --> 03:14:33.236
speed to go to the other tentacle?

4926
03:14:33.236 --> 03:14:34.243
MATT: You can.

4927
03:14:34.243 --> 03:14:36.062
TRAVIS: And chop it up?

4928
03:14:36.062 --> 03:14:38.079
MATT: You may.

4929
03:14:38.079 --> 03:14:39.952
TRAVIS: That's a 23.

4930
03:14:39.952 --> 03:14:42.414
MATT: That hits. Roll damage.

4931
03:14:42.414 --> 03:14:44.667
SAM: ♪ Paladin, warlock, paladin, warlock ♪

4932
03:14:44.667 --> 03:14:49.121
TRAVIS: 12 plus two is 15 points of slashing damage.

4933
03:14:49.121 --> 03:14:52.174
MATT: 15 points of slashing damage, nice.

4934
03:14:52.174 --> 03:14:54.580
You carve through it. It's already looking very hurt.

4935
03:14:54.580 --> 03:14:58.171
It turns around to look in your direction.

4936
03:14:58.171 --> 03:14:59.453
That finishes your turn. Jester, you're up.

4937
03:14:59.453 --> 03:15:00.286
Caduceus, you're on deck.

4938
03:15:00.286 --> 03:15:03.168
LAURA: Spiritual serrated lollipop hitting the glass case

4939
03:15:03.168 --> 03:15:05.165
around the heart!

4940
03:15:05.165 --> 03:15:06.232
SAM: That's a crazy sentence.

4941
03:15:06.232 --> 03:15:10.379
MATT: If you want to, actually no, currently it's considered

4942
03:15:10.379 --> 03:15:12.485
flanked by Fjord, but it won't do much

4943
03:15:12.485 --> 03:15:13.713
because it's just a case.

4944
03:15:13.713 --> 03:15:14.744
Anyway, it's just a roll.

4945
03:15:14.744 --> 03:15:17.872
LAURA: Okay, well, it's a 29.

4946
03:15:17.872 --> 03:15:20.460
MATT: 29 hits, you can go ahead and roll damage.

4947
03:15:21.518 --> 03:15:22.660
LAURA: 10 points.

4948
03:15:22.660 --> 03:15:24.376
MATT: 10 points of damage.

4949
03:15:25.771 --> 03:15:30.771
It cracks even further. It's looking pretty damaged.

4950
03:15:30.820 --> 03:15:34.807
LAURA: Pretty damaged, and did it seem like when Fjord used

4951
03:15:34.807 --> 03:15:36.609
his Eldritch Blast on it, did it seem like

4952
03:15:36.609 --> 03:15:38.381
it did anything to it?

4953
03:15:38.381 --> 03:15:41.158
MATT: It looked like his attack
on it was just a glancing blow,

4954
03:15:41.158 --> 03:15:43.020
like it wasn't a full-on impact.

4955
03:15:43.020 --> 03:15:46.745
LAURA: Okay, then I'm going to cast...

4956
03:15:48.478 --> 03:15:49.740
Dawn.

4957
03:15:49.740 --> 03:15:51.402
SAM: What?
TRAVIS: What?

4958
03:15:51.402 --> 03:15:52.938
SAM: Dong?
LAURA: Dawn.

4959
03:15:52.938 --> 03:15:53.865
MARISHA: Dawn?

4960
03:15:53.865 --> 03:15:54.967
MATT: Dong?
TRAVIS: D-A-W-N?

4961
03:15:54.967 --> 03:15:57.253
LAURA: I'm going to cast Dong. Dawn.

4962
03:15:57.253 --> 03:15:58.114
MATT: Okay.

4963
03:15:58.114 --> 03:16:02.988
LAURA: It is a 30-foot radius--

4964
03:16:02.988 --> 03:16:04.932
SAM: Flesh tree.
LAURA: -- cylinder.

4965
03:16:04.932 --> 03:16:05.765
MATT: Okay.

4966
03:16:08.595 --> 03:16:11.997
We'll say it is actually quite larger than this.

4967
03:16:11.997 --> 03:16:16.246
LAURA: Okay, yeah, I'm going to get the heart in there,

4968
03:16:16.246 --> 03:16:17.472
like right there, yeah.

4969
03:16:17.472 --> 03:16:19.495
MATT: Okay, so this entire side of the room

4970
03:16:19.495 --> 03:16:22.086
is suddenly engulfed with?

4971
03:16:22.086 --> 03:16:23.636
LAURA: Radiant sunlight.

4972
03:16:25.777 --> 03:16:28.903
MATT: This column of bright, like the brightest light

4973
03:16:28.903 --> 03:16:30.161
you've ever seen,

4974
03:16:30.161 --> 03:16:33.014
suddenly fills the right side
of the chamber. What does it do?

4975
03:16:33.014 --> 03:16:37.762
LAURA: It does 4d10 radiant damage on anything inside of it.

4976
03:16:37.762 --> 03:16:39.769
MATT: Okay. What's the saving throw?

4977
03:16:39.769 --> 03:16:41.937
LAURA: Constitution of 17.

4978
03:16:41.937 --> 03:16:43.200
MATT: For half?

4979
03:16:43.200 --> 03:16:44.192
LAURA: Yes.
MATT: Okay.

4980
03:16:44.192 --> 03:16:46.735
It automatically succeeds on its saving throw,

4981
03:16:46.735 --> 03:16:49.638
as is the effect of this dome.

4982
03:16:49.638 --> 03:16:50.969
This protective point.

4983
03:16:50.969 --> 03:16:53.050
So it does take half damage, I believe

4984
03:16:53.050 --> 03:16:56.133
that's what the spell says for a successful save?

4985
03:16:58.054 --> 03:17:00.297
LAURA: 10, 20.
SAM: It says half, yeah.

4986
03:17:00.297 --> 03:17:01.617
LAURA: So 10 points of radiant damage.

4987
03:17:01.617 --> 03:17:03.510
MATT: 10 points of radiant damage, all righty.

4988
03:17:03.510 --> 03:17:07.086
As it blasts into it, you can see where it leaves behind,

4989
03:17:07.086 --> 03:17:08.530
some of the glyphs start sparking a bit.

4990
03:17:08.530 --> 03:17:10.826
It's looking damaged.

4991
03:17:10.826 --> 03:17:11.704
Does that finish your turn?

4992
03:17:11.704 --> 03:17:12.537
LAURA: Yes.

4993
03:17:12.537 --> 03:17:14.067
MATT: Caduceus, you're up. Nott, you're on deck.

4994
03:17:14.067 --> 03:17:15.595
LIAM: Break the glass.

4995
03:17:15.595 --> 03:17:17.159
LAURA: Yeah, so nobody go inside of it.

4996
03:17:17.159 --> 03:17:22.075
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a Sacred Flame

4997
03:17:22.075 --> 03:17:23.725
to the bloody tentacle.

4998
03:17:23.725 --> 03:17:24.736
MATT: Okay.

4999
03:17:24.736 --> 03:17:26.739
TRAVIS: The bloody tentacle.

5000
03:17:26.739 --> 03:17:28.204
MATT: That it's going to be a 14?

5001
03:17:28.204 --> 03:17:31.486
TALIESIN: (cackles)

5002
03:17:31.486 --> 03:17:32.627
Hey!

5003
03:17:34.649 --> 03:17:35.740
18.

5004
03:17:38.109 --> 03:17:39.999
MATT: Burned. For the first time since the battle began,

5005
03:17:39.999 --> 03:17:42.849
there are no tendrils on the battlefield.

5006
03:17:42.849 --> 03:17:45.583
LAURA: That cylinder stays up for a minute, by the way.

5007
03:17:45.583 --> 03:17:46.574
MATT: Oh, it stays up?

5008
03:17:46.574 --> 03:17:49.167
Does it continue to damage, or it's just bright?

5009
03:17:49.167 --> 03:17:51.627
LAURA: It continues to damage anything that's inside of it.

5010
03:17:51.627 --> 03:17:53.568
TRAVIS: Round after round after round?
LAURA: For a full minute.

5011
03:17:53.568 --> 03:17:55.970
TALIESIN: And you can move it, apparently, I think.

5012
03:17:55.970 --> 03:17:56.950
SAM: Yes.
MATT: What level is that?

5013
03:17:56.950 --> 03:17:58.131
LAURA: It's fifth.

5014
03:17:58.131 --> 03:18:00.270
MATT: 5th-level.
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's an FU.

5015
03:18:00.270 --> 03:18:01.854
MATT: Oh yeah.

5016
03:18:01.854 --> 03:18:03.370
SAM: Damn.

5017
03:18:03.370 --> 03:18:05.665
TRAVIS: Okay. Does that hurt us if we walk in it?

5018
03:18:05.665 --> 03:18:06.791
LAURA: Yes.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

5019
03:18:06.791 --> 03:18:09.044
TRAVIS: Good, good.
LAURA: Any creature within it.

5020
03:18:09.044 --> 03:18:10.167
MATT: A creature must also make the save

5021
03:18:10.167 --> 03:18:12.007
whenever it ends its turn in the cylinder.

5022
03:18:12.007 --> 03:18:15.565
Wow, yeah. We're going to say, for the purposes of this--

5023
03:18:15.565 --> 03:18:17.434
TALIESIN: Oh, when it ends its turn, oh yeah.

5024
03:18:17.434 --> 03:18:18.762
MATT: We'll put this up here as a reminder,

5025
03:18:18.762 --> 03:18:21.691
but it's really this whole area here.

5026
03:18:21.691 --> 03:18:24.120
TALIESIN: Let's do one more Mass Healing Word.

5027
03:18:24.120 --> 03:18:25.807
MARISHA: Eyy!
SAM: One more Mass Healing Word.

5028
03:18:27.589 --> 03:18:29.497
TALIESIN: Let's get the one more crazy Healing Word,

5029
03:18:29.497 --> 03:18:32.513
and that's, my god, again,

5030
03:18:32.513 --> 03:18:35.013
nine more points of healing to everybody.

5031
03:18:35.013 --> 03:18:36.195
I rolled another four on a d4.

5032
03:18:36.195 --> 03:18:37.998
MATT: That's amazing, man. Good on you.

5033
03:18:37.998 --> 03:18:38.963
TALIESIN: It's going.

5034
03:18:38.963 --> 03:18:41.032
SAM: It's the golden snitch all over again.

5035
03:18:41.032 --> 03:18:44.714
MATT: All righty. That finishes Caduceus' go?

5036
03:18:44.714 --> 03:18:49.377
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to also head a little bit closer.

5037
03:18:49.377 --> 03:18:50.858
I'm going to head a little bit closer

5038
03:18:50.858 --> 03:18:52.244
to the group to the right.

5039
03:18:52.244 --> 03:18:53.393
MATT: Like 10 feet, 15 feet?

5040
03:18:53.393 --> 03:18:54.226
TALIESIN: Yeah, there.

5041
03:18:54.226 --> 03:18:55.826
MATT: Okay. That finishes your go.

5042
03:18:56.951 --> 03:18:59.428
Nott, you're up, Beau, you're on deck.

5043
03:18:59.428 --> 03:19:02.882
SAM: I snatch the magnifying glass back.

5044
03:19:02.882 --> 03:19:07.480
I say: I'll show you how to do it, and I'll hold my turn.

5045
03:19:07.480 --> 03:19:08.688
LAURA: What?

5046
03:19:08.688 --> 03:19:11.910
SAM: I will hold until I'm helped.

5047
03:19:11.910 --> 03:19:13.427
MATT: Okay, you're not close enough to the glyph--

5048
03:19:13.427 --> 03:19:14.588
SAM: I will move to it.

5049
03:19:14.588 --> 03:19:17.780
MARISHA: Can I-- okay, okay.

5050
03:19:18.793 --> 03:19:20.900
I'm going to go next, so I'mma go.

5051
03:19:20.900 --> 03:19:22.850
I don't know if we can like--

5052
03:19:22.850 --> 03:19:25.952
TALIESIN: Do a movement shift.
MARISHA: Do a move-y shift here?

5053
03:19:25.952 --> 03:19:30.335
A little tradesies on, you know, Three Stoogian, kind of?

5054
03:19:31.249 --> 03:19:34.862
MATT: If you hold your action, you can spend your action

5055
03:19:34.862 --> 03:19:36.883
to move out of the way to let him in; I'll allow it.

5056
03:19:36.883 --> 03:19:38.951
Otherwise, you guys have to work out,

5057
03:19:38.951 --> 03:19:41.148
because right now you're both blocking the view to it.

5058
03:19:41.148 --> 03:19:42.481
LAURA: Just go and hit the glass, Beau.

5059
03:19:42.481 --> 03:19:43.552
MARISHA: That's what I'm trying to do.

5060
03:19:43.552 --> 03:19:45.369
I'm trying to get out, but I can't get out of the way,

5061
03:19:45.369 --> 03:19:47.141
and it's Nott's turn and I'm next,

5062
03:19:47.141 --> 03:19:48.880
but I want to go hit the glass.

5063
03:19:50.188 --> 03:19:51.740
SAM: She's trying to and get out of the way.

5064
03:19:51.740 --> 03:19:54.018
MATT: Right, so for Nott's turn, currently, there's no--

5065
03:19:54.018 --> 03:19:54.956
TRAVIS: You can't switch.

5066
03:19:54.956 --> 03:19:56.377
MATT: Yeah, you can't switch with him.

5067
03:19:56.377 --> 03:19:58.049
Because the order of operations here.

5068
03:19:58.049 --> 03:19:59.287
LAURA: So just hit the glass.

5069
03:19:59.287 --> 03:20:00.666
MARISHA: Fucked by initiative.

5070
03:20:00.666 --> 03:20:02.147
TRAVIS: Fucked by initiative.

5071
03:20:02.147 --> 03:20:06.960
SAM: Okay. I will-- I can't help Caleb until she moves.

5072
03:20:06.960 --> 03:20:08.121
LAURA: So hit the glass.

5073
03:20:08.121 --> 03:20:11.819
SAM: And I can't move after she moves.

5074
03:20:11.819 --> 03:20:13.185
MATT: Can't move if your turn's already done,

5075
03:20:13.185 --> 03:20:15.027
unless you hold your action to move.

5076
03:20:15.027 --> 03:20:17.047
LAURA: Hit the glass.

5077
03:20:17.047 --> 03:20:19.115
MARISHA: But then you-- oh.

5078
03:20:19.115 --> 03:20:21.903
SAM: Okay, then I'll just turn the magnifying glass around

5079
03:20:21.903 --> 03:20:24.688
and I'll shoot the thing.

5080
03:20:24.688 --> 03:20:27.299
MATT: Go for it.
SAM: With my crossbow.

5081
03:20:27.299 --> 03:20:28.140
12.

5082
03:20:28.140 --> 03:20:30.056
MATT: Ricochets off it.

5083
03:20:30.056 --> 03:20:33.042
SAM: Bonus action shoot again.
MATT: Go for it.

5084
03:20:33.042 --> 03:20:34.069
SAM: 23.

5085
03:20:34.069 --> 03:20:35.504
MATT: 23. (ricocheting)

5086
03:20:35.504 --> 03:20:37.167
SAM: I'm not blessed, am I? Wait, I am blessed!

5087
03:20:37.167 --> 03:20:38.692
MATT: You are blessed, yeah.

5088
03:20:41.022 --> 03:20:43.119
SAM and LAURA: 24?
MATT: 24 just hits.

5089
03:20:43.119 --> 03:20:44.515
(cheering)

5090
03:20:44.515 --> 03:20:45.671
TALIESIN: Good to know, good to know.

5091
03:20:45.671 --> 03:20:48.715
LAURA: 24, and 25 for the glyphs. Fuck, dude.

5092
03:20:48.715 --> 03:20:49.548
SAM: Okay.

5093
03:20:49.548 --> 03:20:50.768
MATT: Roll damage.

5094
03:20:50.768 --> 03:20:52.127
LAURA: Do you get sneak attack on the glass?

5095
03:20:52.127 --> 03:20:53.668
SAM: No, probably not.

5096
03:20:53.668 --> 03:20:55.306
11 points of damage.

5097
03:20:56.239 --> 03:20:57.931
MATT: All right.

5098
03:20:57.931 --> 03:20:59.471
The actual bolt sticks into it and you can see

5099
03:20:59.471 --> 03:21:01.115
the glass around it crack

5100
03:21:01.115 --> 03:21:03.676
and spiderweb outward a bit.

5101
03:21:03.676 --> 03:21:05.974
Finishing your go, Beau, you're up.

5102
03:21:05.974 --> 03:21:07.024
LAURA: Beau, you're up.

5103
03:21:07.024 --> 03:21:09.240
LIAM: Either way. Either way.

5104
03:21:09.240 --> 03:21:11.064
TALIESIN: Get it, yeah, go.
LAURA: Do it, just do it.

5105
03:21:11.064 --> 03:21:16.064
MARISHA: Ugh. I'm going to move out of the way and

5106
03:21:16.066 --> 03:21:18.196
go over and start smashing on the thing.

5107
03:21:18.196 --> 03:21:20.278
MATT: Go for it.
TALIESIN: Not in the radius.

5108
03:21:20.278 --> 03:21:23.133
MARISHA: Not in the radius of heart stuff, yeah.

5109
03:21:23.133 --> 03:21:26.286
TRAVIS: God, I wish I had this dispelling stone.

5110
03:21:26.286 --> 03:21:27.119
MARISHA: Fuck.

5111
03:21:28.210 --> 03:21:29.374
LAURA: That would have been pretty awesome.

5112
03:21:29.374 --> 03:21:30.207
MARISHA: Pop pop.

5113
03:21:30.207 --> 03:21:31.996
TALIESIN: With a d4.
MARISHA: With a--

5114
03:21:31.996 --> 03:21:32.996
TRAVIS: Oof.
MARISHA: Nope.

5115
03:21:33.928 --> 03:21:34.847
What is it?

5116
03:21:34.847 --> 03:21:39.847
Okay, well, one can maybe make it if I roll a four.

5117
03:21:40.100 --> 03:21:41.395
24.

5118
03:21:41.395 --> 03:21:42.228
Wait, 24!

5119
03:21:42.228 --> 03:21:44.148
MATT: 24 hits, just exactly.
MARISHA: Yes.

5120
03:21:44.148 --> 03:21:45.565
LIAM: Punch it.

5121
03:21:46.498 --> 03:21:48.966
TALIESIN: Punch it. Do it.

5122
03:21:48.966 --> 03:21:53.966
MARISHA: I'm going to use my-- no, I'm going to use my fist.

5123
03:21:54.414 --> 03:21:55.688
MATT: Okay.

5124
03:21:55.688 --> 03:21:57.111
MARISHA: Nine damage.

5125
03:21:57.111 --> 03:21:58.270
MATT: Nine damage.

5126
03:21:59.716 --> 03:22:02.991
All right, so one fist glances off, the second one,

5127
03:22:02.991 --> 03:22:05.557
the glass glass chamber cracks in a little bit.

5128
03:22:05.557 --> 03:22:08.573
LAURA: Does that do lighting damage because it's
your lightning gloves?

5129
03:22:08.573 --> 03:22:09.406
MATT: No.

5130
03:22:09.406 --> 03:22:11.098
MARISHA: I got to activate them.

5131
03:22:11.098 --> 03:22:13.736
MATT: You still have your bonus action.

5132
03:22:13.736 --> 03:22:15.515
You can see it's cracking on all sides a little bit now.

5133
03:22:15.515 --> 03:22:17.429
It's looking pretty damaged.

5134
03:22:17.429 --> 03:22:20.027
MARISHA: Pretty damaged, it's looking pretty damaged

5135
03:22:20.027 --> 03:22:21.446
Okay, all right.

5136
03:22:21.446 --> 03:22:22.473
Flurry of Blows.

5137
03:22:22.473 --> 03:22:23.859
ALL: Yeah!
MATT: Flurry of Blows.

5138
03:22:23.859 --> 03:22:25.100
Go for it.

5139
03:22:25.100 --> 03:22:27.583
MARISHA: Oh wait, that should've gone. Okay, wait, wait.

5140
03:22:27.583 --> 03:22:28.701
MATT: Two more strikes.

5141
03:22:28.701 --> 03:22:30.443
MARISHA: Yes, yes, okay.

5142
03:22:30.443 --> 03:22:31.906
SAM: <i>Dos más</i> strikes.

5143
03:22:31.906 --> 03:22:33.735
MARISHA: Pop pop.

5144
03:22:33.735 --> 03:22:37.043
Okay, one is 26.

5145
03:22:37.043 --> 03:22:38.451
MATT: 26 hits.

5146
03:22:40.816 --> 03:22:45.816
MARISHA: Nine damage, and then the other one, I can't make.

5147
03:22:46.251 --> 03:22:47.788
LAURA: Even with a four?

5148
03:22:47.788 --> 03:22:50.276
MARISHA: Nope. Miss.

5149
03:22:50.276 --> 03:22:53.042
MATT: You (punching) (cracking)

5150
03:22:53.042 --> 03:22:55.950
It's cracking inward now, starting to push in a bit.

5151
03:22:55.950 --> 03:22:57.431
That finishes your go, Beau. Caleb, you're up.

5152
03:22:57.431 --> 03:22:59.017
LAURA: Go Beau.
MARISHA: My go Beau!

5153
03:22:59.017 --> 03:23:02.574
LIAM: Caleb scratches at his arms and just continues

5154
03:23:02.574 --> 03:23:06.031
to stare at and runs his hand down it, tries again.

5155
03:23:06.031 --> 03:23:07.023
Nope.

5156
03:23:08.448 --> 03:23:11.803
MATT: Halas' designs are too intricate for your mind.

5157
03:23:11.803 --> 03:23:13.787
As distracted as you are in the moment,

5158
03:23:13.787 --> 03:23:15.629
the sweat dripping down your head,

5159
03:23:15.629 --> 03:23:19.016
the humid atmosphere, it's toying with you.

5160
03:23:19.016 --> 03:23:20.593
LIAM: But I look over my shoulder and see

5161
03:23:20.593 --> 03:23:23.128
what's going on, and then I'm going to move.

5162
03:23:23.128 --> 03:23:24.427
MARISHA: Make room for Nott.

5163
03:23:24.427 --> 03:23:27.926
LIAM: (counting) 30, I'm going right there,

5164
03:23:27.926 --> 03:23:30.380
and I tell Willi to swing away.

5165
03:23:30.380 --> 03:23:31.705
MATT: I would say you probably have to move a little

5166
03:23:31.705 --> 03:23:32.582
here just to stay out of the radius,

5167
03:23:32.582 --> 03:23:34.557
because it is bigger than that.
LIAM: Oh, okay.

5168
03:23:34.557 --> 03:23:37.223
MARISHA: You're not going to stay and help Nott?
LIAM: Okay. Willi's going to take a couple of punchos. No.

5169
03:23:37.223 --> 03:23:38.056
MARISHA: All right.

5170
03:23:39.483 --> 03:23:41.993
LIAM: That is a 26.
MATT: Hits.

5171
03:23:41.993 --> 03:23:43.671
LIAM: And a 16 which doesn't, so.

5172
03:23:43.671 --> 03:23:46.880
MATT: Damage on one of them.
LIAM: Yeah.

5173
03:23:46.880 --> 03:23:47.793
SAM: Come on, Willi.

5174
03:23:47.793 --> 03:23:49.793
LIAM: Nine points of damage.

5175
03:23:50.760 --> 03:23:54.426
MATT: (impacts) It now cracks,

5176
03:23:54.426 --> 03:23:56.059
spidering all around it.

5177
03:23:56.059 --> 03:23:57.868
It's looking real hurt.

5178
03:23:57.868 --> 03:24:00.096
That finishes your go. It's now the Permaheart's turn.

5179
03:24:00.096 --> 03:24:03.870
Everyone suffers eight points of necrotic damage

5180
03:24:03.870 --> 03:24:06.440
across the entire chamber.

5181
03:24:07.282 --> 03:24:11.648
Also, one tentacle arrives.

5182
03:24:11.648 --> 03:24:12.948
Which is going to...

5183
03:24:16.023 --> 03:24:17.023
right there.

5184
03:24:18.535 --> 03:24:21.729
That's going to attack Beauregard.

5185
03:24:21.729 --> 03:24:23.745
First, let's see if it can--

5186
03:24:23.745 --> 03:24:26.453
it can re-summon its tentacles now.

5187
03:24:27.614 --> 03:24:29.027
TALIESIN: Does it take its damage

5188
03:24:29.027 --> 03:24:30.357
from the top of its turn?

5189
03:24:30.357 --> 03:24:32.068
LAURA: It's at the end of its turn.

5190
03:24:32.068 --> 03:24:34.847
I rolled a con save, and I kept it up.

5191
03:24:34.847 --> 03:24:35.680
MATT: Great.

5192
03:24:35.680 --> 03:24:37.588
All right, so one's going to be attacking Beauregard.

5193
03:24:37.588 --> 03:24:38.584
That is going to be an 18.

5194
03:24:38.584 --> 03:24:39.847
MARISHA: Miss.
MATT: Misses.

5195
03:24:39.847 --> 03:24:41.617
You slap it away.

5196
03:24:41.617 --> 03:24:44.143
The other one is going to be attacking you, Jester.

5197
03:24:44.143 --> 03:24:45.565
That's going to be a 19?

5198
03:24:45.565 --> 03:24:46.773
LAURA: Bleah.

5199
03:24:48.371 --> 03:24:50.612
MATT: You suffer 13 points of bludgeoning damage,

5200
03:24:50.612 --> 03:24:52.978
and you make strength saving throw.

5201
03:24:52.978 --> 03:24:56.177
LAURA: (blows raspberry)

5202
03:24:58.721 --> 03:25:00.123
12?

5203
03:25:00.123 --> 03:25:02.417
MATT: 12 fails, you are grappled.

5204
03:25:02.417 --> 03:25:04.376
However, make a constitution saving throw for me as well,

5205
03:25:04.376 --> 03:25:06.546
to see if you can maintain the spell.
LAURA: (blows raspberry)

5206
03:25:06.546 --> 03:25:08.922
(continues blowing raspberry)

5207
03:25:09.947 --> 03:25:11.604
No.

5208
03:25:12.454 --> 03:25:14.219
MATT: The spell dissipates.

5209
03:25:14.219 --> 03:25:16.624
The Dawn light fades.

5210
03:25:16.624 --> 03:25:18.584
TALIESIN: Ugh! This shit is smart.

5211
03:25:18.584 --> 03:25:20.436
MATT: That finishes the end of the Permaheart's turn.

5212
03:25:20.436 --> 03:25:21.492
Fjord, you're up.

5213
03:25:21.492 --> 03:25:24.358
TRAVIS: Is this tentacle in melee range of Nott?

5214
03:25:24.358 --> 03:25:26.296
MATT: Right now it is not.

5215
03:25:26.296 --> 03:25:27.132
TRAVIS: Okay.

5216
03:25:27.132 --> 03:25:30.103
ALL: (unimpressed laughter)

5217
03:25:30.103 --> 03:25:32.656
TRAVIS: But it can move, but not before Nott's turn.

5218
03:25:32.656 --> 03:25:36.259
So I'll send two Eldritch Blasts at the tentacle

5219
03:25:36.259 --> 03:25:38.348
that's a grappling Jester.

5220
03:25:38.348 --> 03:25:39.348
MATT: Go for it.

5221
03:25:42.818 --> 03:25:44.392
TRAVIS: Sorry, wrong one.

5222
03:25:44.392 --> 03:25:48.541
That is a 14 and a 24.

5223
03:25:48.541 --> 03:25:49.791
MATT: Both hit.
TRAVIS: Great.

5224
03:25:52.884 --> 03:25:56.492
That is 12 points of force damage

5225
03:25:56.492 --> 03:26:00.792
and 14 points of force damage.

5226
03:26:01.712 --> 03:26:04.723
MATT: You shatter the one that had just grabbed Jester.

5227
03:26:04.723 --> 03:26:05.784
LAURA: Thanks, Fjord.

5228
03:26:05.784 --> 03:26:07.754
TRAVIS: (like Jester) No problem, and I will--

5229
03:26:07.754 --> 03:26:10.654
SAM: It's his real accent!

5230
03:26:10.654 --> 03:26:14.031
TRAVIS: I will move-- I'll stay right here on the ridge,

5231
03:26:14.031 --> 03:26:15.070
but come around on this side.

5232
03:26:15.070 --> 03:26:17.916
MATT: All right. Right there on the edge?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

5233
03:26:17.916 --> 03:26:21.125
MATT: Finishing Fjord's turn, Jester, you're up.
Caduceus, you're on deck.

5234
03:26:21.125 --> 03:26:23.313
This is on the cusp of breaking.

5235
03:26:23.313 --> 03:26:25.041
LAURA: I use my Spiritual Weapon to attack it.

5236
03:26:25.041 --> 03:26:26.040
MATT: Go for it.

5237
03:26:26.040 --> 03:26:27.901
SAM: Follow your art heart.

5238
03:26:27.901 --> 03:26:28.937
MARISHA: (laughs)

5239
03:26:28.937 --> 03:26:31.926
(cheering)
LAURA: Natural 20!

5240
03:26:31.926 --> 03:26:34.956
MATT: Go ahead and roll some damage for me.
MARISHA: What what!

5241
03:26:34.956 --> 03:26:38.256
LAURA: 10 plus-- 15 points of--

5242
03:26:38.256 --> 03:26:40.256
SAM: Doubled it?
LAURA: Yeah.

5243
03:26:40.256 --> 03:26:41.197
MATT: (shattering)

5244
03:26:41.197 --> 03:26:42.155
(cheering)

5245
03:26:42.155 --> 03:26:44.415
MATT: The glass shatters and breaks away,

5246
03:26:44.415 --> 03:26:46.054
the glyphs sparking to darkness,

5247
03:26:46.054 --> 03:26:47.395
and now as it all falls,

5248
03:26:47.395 --> 03:26:51.020
the heart falls there and is still beating.

5249
03:26:52.826 --> 03:26:55.343
But it's now exposed.

5250
03:26:55.343 --> 03:26:58.896
The air around you also, that horrible, sickening feeling

5251
03:26:58.896 --> 03:27:00.059
now intensifies.

5252
03:27:00.059 --> 03:27:01.981
SAM: Oh no.

5253
03:27:01.981 --> 03:27:03.708
MARISHA: Yeah, figured that.

5254
03:27:03.708 --> 03:27:04.973
TRAVIS: We all shit our pants.

5255
03:27:04.973 --> 03:27:09.973
LAURA: I'm going to Guiding Bolt it (gags) at level four.

5256
03:27:10.016 --> 03:27:11.766
MATT: Oh shit, go for it.

5257
03:27:13.894 --> 03:27:16.344
LAURA: Okay.
SAM: Explosive diarrhea.

5258
03:27:16.344 --> 03:27:17.544
MARISHA: Ew!

5259
03:27:19.843 --> 03:27:21.602
LAURA: Oh yeah, that's 27 to hit.

5260
03:27:21.602 --> 03:27:22.766
MATT: That definitely hits.

5261
03:27:22.766 --> 03:27:25.109
Without its arcane shell, its AC is much lower.

5262
03:27:25.109 --> 03:27:27.379
It is literally a giant heart on the ground.

5263
03:27:27.379 --> 03:27:30.547
LAURA: So that's 7d6.

5264
03:27:30.547 --> 03:27:32.109
SAM: 7d6?
LAURA: Yeah.

5265
03:27:32.109 --> 03:27:33.325
TRAVIS: Ooh!

5266
03:27:34.738 --> 03:27:36.806
MATT: Oh, that's a good set of rolls.

5267
03:27:36.806 --> 03:27:37.926
SAM: Lot of sixes.

5268
03:27:37.926 --> 03:27:42.926
LAURA: 10, 22, 27,

03:27:43.592 --> 03:27:45.667
30 points.

5270
03:27:46.786 --> 03:27:50.945
MATT: As you blast into it, the energy burns across it,

5271
03:27:50.945 --> 03:27:53.981
sparkling pinkish hue turns to green around it,

5272
03:27:53.981 --> 03:27:56.894
and you see the heart stop beating for a second

5273
03:27:56.894 --> 03:27:58.939
and then continue its thrum.

5274
03:27:58.939 --> 03:28:01.590
It's, you know, took a hit.

5275
03:28:01.590 --> 03:28:03.604
LAURA: The next attack has advantage.

5276
03:28:03.604 --> 03:28:04.548
MATT: Exactly.

5277
03:28:04.548 --> 03:28:07.050
That finishes your turn, Jester. Caduceus, you're up.

5278
03:28:07.050 --> 03:28:09.577
Unless you want to move, Jester.

5279
03:28:10.569 --> 03:28:12.158
LAURA: That thing would hit me, right?

5280
03:28:12.158 --> 03:28:13.564
MATT: Yeah, probably.
LAURA: Yeah, I'll stay.

5281
03:28:13.564 --> 03:28:16.065
TALIESIN: Is it possible to get next to Beau

5282
03:28:16.065 --> 03:28:18.637
without getting in range of that tentacle?

5283
03:28:19.503 --> 03:28:20.336
MATT: Nope.

5284
03:28:22.161 --> 03:28:25.560
Actually, no, it wouldn't.

5285
03:28:25.560 --> 03:28:26.574
TALIESIN: Oh, okay.

5286
03:28:26.574 --> 03:28:28.060
Well, you know what, things happen.

5287
03:28:29.002 --> 03:28:33.985
I'm going to go stand between Beau and Jester

5288
03:28:33.985 --> 03:28:37.343
and I'm going to cast Holy Weapon on Beau.

5289
03:28:37.343 --> 03:28:38.815
MATT: Okay.

5290
03:28:38.815 --> 03:28:40.421
LAURA: Tight.

5291
03:28:40.421 --> 03:28:42.368
MARISHA: That gives me like 2d8 hit, right?

5292
03:28:42.368 --> 03:28:43.978
TALIESIN: Adds 2d8 radiant damage.

5293
03:28:43.978 --> 03:28:45.896
MATT: This means everyone's Bless has faded now.

5294
03:28:45.896 --> 03:28:47.927
TALIESIN: Yes, no more Bless. Sorry, guys.

5295
03:28:47.927 --> 03:28:49.869
TRAVIS: No more Bless.

5296
03:28:49.869 --> 03:28:51.228
MARISHA: 2d8 radiant.

MARISHA: Oh my god. Beautiful. It's beautiful!

5299
03:29:01.402 --> 03:29:04.305
TALIESIN: I'm going to turn invisible as well.

5300
03:29:04.305 --> 03:29:05.138
MATT: Okay.

5301
03:29:12.325 --> 03:29:13.397
All righty.

5302
03:29:13.397 --> 03:29:14.870

5303
03:29:14.870 --> 03:29:15.966

5305
03:29:17.336 --> 03:29:18.169
LAURA: Yeah.

5306
03:29:18.169 --> 03:29:19.877
SAM: All right.

5307
03:29:19.877 --> 03:29:23.679
I will rock this way.

5308
03:29:23.679 --> 03:29:24.883
LAURA: I bet it hates fire.

5309
03:29:24.883 --> 03:29:26.579
TALIESIN: Oh, can we lose the jar, or is the jar permanent?

5310
03:29:26.579 --> 03:29:28.485
MATT: The jar is part of the construct, unfortunately.

5311
03:29:28.485 --> 03:29:30.198
LAURA: We need fire to kill it.

5312
03:29:30.198 --> 03:29:31.390
SAM: To kill the heart?

5313
03:29:31.390 --> 03:29:32.614
LAURA: Yeah, just like everything else.

5314
03:29:32.614 --> 03:29:35.964
I bet it needs fire because
it will heal itself or something.

5315
03:29:35.964 --> 03:29:38.505
SAM: I could shoot an explosive arrow, but

5316
03:29:38.505 --> 03:29:39.630
you're all around it.

5317
03:29:39.630 --> 03:29:41.574
LAURA: Yeah, maybe don't do that.

5318
03:29:41.574 --> 03:29:43.569
SAM: So I'll just shoot a regular bolt.

5319
03:29:43.569 --> 03:29:44.577
MATT: Go for it.

5320
03:29:44.577 --> 03:29:46.256
SAM: Regular bolt!

5321
03:29:46.256 --> 03:29:48.196
SAM: Wait, do I get sneak attack damage?

5322
03:29:48.196 --> 03:29:49.180
MATT: You do not.

5323
03:29:49.180 --> 03:29:52.119
SAM: Well then, I will go behind that pillar and hide.

5324
03:29:52.119 --> 03:29:53.602
MATT: Actually, you know what, no,
for this I would allow it,

5325
03:29:53.602 --> 03:29:55.469
because it is exposed,

5326
03:29:55.469 --> 03:29:57.027
it does not have the chamber around it.

5327
03:29:57.027 --> 03:29:58.896
It does have a discernible anatomy, it is a heart,

5328
03:29:58.896 --> 03:30:00.250
it is essentially a weak point.

5329
03:30:00.250 --> 03:30:02.337
I will allow sneak attack damage, yeah.

5330
03:30:02.337 --> 03:30:04.126

MATT: Snack attack damage.

5331

03:30:05.042 --> 03:30:06.629

5333
03:30:06.629 --> 03:30:07.819
ALL: Whoa!

and shift in its space from the impact of the bolt,

5355
03:30:42.412 --> 03:30:43.573

5440
03:33:57.420 --> 03:34:01.057
This almost bonfire, and as it slowly trickles down,

5441
03:34:01.057 --> 03:34:05.504
you can see the ashen remains of the Permaheart before you.

5442
03:34:05.504 --> 03:34:06.343
LAURA: We did it.

5443
03:34:06.343 --> 03:34:08.068
SAM: More like Tempraheart.

5444
03:34:08.068 --> 03:34:10.778
TRAVIS: If it bleeds, we can kill it.

5445
03:34:10.778 --> 03:34:11.869
(laughter)

5446
03:34:11.869 --> 03:34:13.856
LAURA: We should get this stuff off of us.

5447
03:34:13.856 --> 03:34:16.413
MATT: The tendril falls dead, and within a few moments,

5448
03:34:16.413 --> 03:34:19.368
you can see all of these stretching bits of flesh

5449
03:34:19.368 --> 03:34:23.337
and vein throughout the floor begin to turn black.

5450
03:34:23.337 --> 03:34:26.046
LAURA: I wonder if the Laughing Hand was like: Ugh!

5451
03:34:26.046 --> 03:34:27.504
Oh, it hurts.

5452
03:34:27.504 --> 03:34:29.266
MARISHA: Yeah, he's got like a nosebleed.

5453
03:34:29.266 --> 03:34:30.961
TRAVIS: Do you want to check any
of the runes on the surface?

5454
03:34:30.961 --> 03:34:33.719
Is any of this of use to you for protection or?

5455
03:34:33.719 --> 03:34:35.659
TALIESIN: Is the heart doing anything?

5456
03:34:35.659 --> 03:34:37.543
MATT: No, it is ash.

5457
03:34:39.576 --> 03:34:40.967
TALIESIN: What's happening in the room?

5458
03:34:40.967 --> 03:34:42.413
Anything weird?

5459
03:34:42.413 --> 03:34:44.543
I'm just paying attention for rumbling.

5460
03:34:44.543 --> 03:34:46.157
MATT: Make a perception check.

5461
03:34:46.157 --> 03:34:47.529
TALIESIN: Okay, I will do that.

5462
03:34:47.529 --> 03:34:49.573
SAM: I'm going to loot the heart.

5463
03:34:49.573 --> 03:34:50.406
(laughter)

5464
03:34:50.406 --> 03:34:51.678
MATT: Make an investigation check.

5465
03:34:51.678 --> 03:34:53.244
SAM: All right.
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

5466
03:34:53.244 --> 03:34:54.077
MATT: Natural 20.

5467
03:34:54.077 --> 03:34:57.705
TALIESIN: So a perception of like 29, 33.

5468
03:34:57.705 --> 03:34:59.047
MATT: Yeah.

5469
03:34:59.047 --> 03:35:02.097
You quietly focus, letting the Wildmother

5470
03:35:02.097 --> 03:35:05.514
speak through you and sense the space.

5471
03:35:05.514 --> 03:35:06.597
No heartbeat.

5472
03:35:08.397 --> 03:35:09.897
The room is still.

5473
03:35:10.900 --> 03:35:12.994
The heart is dead.

5474
03:35:12.994 --> 03:35:16.925
The chamber now cold, its purpose fulfilled.

5475
03:35:16.925 --> 03:35:18.567
LAURA: Wow.
TALIESIN: I think we're good.

5476
03:35:19.550 --> 03:35:20.812
LAURA: Wow.

5477
03:35:20.812 --> 03:35:22.048
TALIESIN: (gagging)

5478
03:35:22.048 --> 03:35:23.100
SAM: (yelling)

5479
03:35:23.100 --> 03:35:24.017
TALIESIN: Okay, okay.

5480
03:35:25.610 --> 03:35:26.843
SAM: I rolled a 13 to

5481
03:35:26.843 --> 03:35:28.859
look and see if the heart has any goals.

5482
03:35:28.859 --> 03:35:30.076
MATT: Okay.

5483
03:35:30.076 --> 03:35:33.508
You find a lot of ashes, and like a hint of

5484
03:35:33.508 --> 03:35:37.213
very, very dark, blackened flesh.

5485
03:35:37.213 --> 03:35:39.177
Nothing.

5486
03:35:39.177 --> 03:35:41.535
TRAVIS: Again, Caleb, these runes,

5487
03:35:41.535 --> 03:35:43.114
are they of any use to you?

5488
03:35:43.114 --> 03:35:45.591
These pieces, these shards, this material?

5489
03:35:45.591 --> 03:35:47.278
SAM: Where's Yussa?

5490
03:35:47.278 --> 03:35:51.628
LIAM: I mean, I will, at Fjord's suggestion, I'm--

5491
03:35:51.628 --> 03:35:55.987
I want to get out of here, but I will inspect this.

5492
03:35:57.054 --> 03:35:59.237
I cast Detect Magic, is there anything?

5493
03:36:01.432 --> 03:36:04.923
MATT: No, the chamber is bereft of magic.

5494
03:36:04.923 --> 03:36:07.651
All things within that were living and/or magical,

5495
03:36:07.651 --> 03:36:12.382
outside of what you carry amongst yourselves, now dormant.

5496
03:36:12.382 --> 03:36:13.847
TALIESIN: And the door?

5497
03:36:13.847 --> 03:36:15.033
MATT: Ah.

5498
03:36:15.033 --> 03:36:16.242
If you get close enough here, the door itself

5499
03:36:16.242 --> 03:36:18.329
still emanates or magical aura.

5500
03:36:18.329 --> 03:36:19.222
LAURA: Oh.

5501
03:36:19.222 --> 03:36:21.491
TALIESIN: Let's check for other passages, see if maybe--

5502
03:36:21.491 --> 03:36:22.972
MARISHA: Question.
MATT: Yes.

5503
03:36:22.972 --> 03:36:26.018
MARISHA: Can I go over to these plaques, these tablets?

5504
03:36:26.018 --> 03:36:27.095
MATT: Mm-hmm.

5505
03:36:27.095 --> 03:36:31.586
MARISHA: I did a like rub, a rubbing of the

5506
03:36:31.586 --> 03:36:35.963
glyphs that were, when we were following Obann.

5507
03:36:35.963 --> 03:36:37.414
MATT: Yes.

5508
03:36:37.414 --> 03:36:39.926
MARISHA: I pull that out in my notes, in Beau's notes.

5509
03:36:39.926 --> 03:36:41.609
Do they compare?

5510
03:36:41.609 --> 03:36:42.829
MATT: They are different.
MARISHA: Okay.

5511
03:36:42.829 --> 03:36:46.779
MATT: Yeah, you don't see any sort of patterns

5512
03:36:46.779 --> 03:36:49.863
that overlap enough to catch your worry.

5513
03:36:49.863 --> 03:36:51.163
MARISHA: Okay.

5514
03:36:51.163 --> 03:36:53.753
TRAVIS: Looking underneath where the case was,

5515
03:36:53.753 --> 03:36:56.673
any sort of, anything we can move,

5516
03:36:56.673 --> 03:37:00.006
push, shove, symbology to take note of?

5517
03:37:00.006 --> 03:37:03.993
MATT: I mean, it's just a lot of dead flesh.

5518
03:37:04.948 --> 03:37:07.439
TRAVIS: Shall we return to the study?

5519
03:37:07.439 --> 03:37:09.086
SAM: Where is Yussa?

5520
03:37:09.086 --> 03:37:10.387
LAURA: Somewhere else.

5521
03:37:10.387 --> 03:37:12.826
TRAVIS: Probably the Dreadnought.
LAURA: We think he's in the Dreadnought.

5522
03:37:12.826 --> 03:37:13.659
SAM: Jesus.

5523
03:37:14.584 --> 03:37:15.755
LAURA: Let's get out of here.

5524
03:37:15.755 --> 03:37:17.869
LIAM: Probably retreat to the previous chamber,

5525
03:37:17.869 --> 03:37:19.955
which is not much better than this.

5526
03:37:19.955 --> 03:37:20.967
TRAVIS: We head to the door.

5527
03:37:20.967 --> 03:37:22.467
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.
MATT: Okay.

5528
03:37:22.467 --> 03:37:25.018
You guys all head back to the door where you entered,

5529
03:37:25.018 --> 03:37:29.083
step back out into the familiar spiraling staircase

5530
03:37:29.083 --> 03:37:31.978
into darkness, only you can still see the entrance

5531
03:37:31.978 --> 03:37:34.987
in the distance where you entered from underneath the desk.

5532
03:37:34.987 --> 03:37:37.467
Eventually, the spiral turns into an ascending staircase

5533
03:37:37.467 --> 03:37:39.684
and you all, one by one, emerge once more

5534
03:37:39.684 --> 03:37:42.645
into the Permaheart study.

5535
03:37:43.920 --> 03:37:45.992
The distant thrum now quiet.

5536
03:37:45.992 --> 03:37:47.622
LAURA: Oh wow. What about the little pieces?

5537
03:37:47.622 --> 03:37:50.173
Are they quivering still or are they--

5538
03:37:50.173 --> 03:37:52.342
MATT: Oh, you go and inspect the jars?

5539
03:37:52.342 --> 03:37:56.149
All the pieces are black and unmoving.

5540
03:37:56.149 --> 03:37:57.786
LAURA: That's good, that's really good.

5541
03:37:57.786 --> 03:37:59.674
MARISHA: Anything else look different?

5542
03:37:59.674 --> 03:38:02.295
MATT: Beyond that, no, but every other sliver

5543
03:38:02.295 --> 03:38:04.734
of contained Permaheart flesh that was seemingly

5544
03:38:04.734 --> 03:38:07.937
being studied or contained within these jars

5545
03:38:07.937 --> 03:38:09.981
has turned black and it's now beginning

5546
03:38:09.981 --> 03:38:11.893
to just liquefy within its jar.

5547
03:38:11.893 --> 03:38:13.231
LAURA: We should take his notes.

5548
03:38:13.231 --> 03:38:15.383
LIAM: I was about to say, I gather up and take his notes.

5549
03:38:15.383 --> 03:38:16.216
MATT: Okay.

5550
03:38:18.391 --> 03:38:20.585
LIAM: Not much further to the golem workshop,

5551
03:38:20.585 --> 03:38:25.568
we could hole up there for a bit and I could fix William.

5552
03:38:26.566 --> 03:38:27.769
TALIESIN: I'm okay with that.

5553
03:38:27.769 --> 03:38:29.263
SAM: Like spend the night?

5554
03:38:29.263 --> 03:38:31.592
We're going to lose another week outside.

5555
03:38:31.592 --> 03:38:33.212
MARISHA: Should we check in with Allura?

5556
03:38:33.212 --> 03:38:36.222
LIAM: We came in here to find Yussa and we don't have Yussa.

5557
03:38:36.222 --> 03:38:37.657
LAURA: We could do it again.

5558
03:38:37.657 --> 03:38:39.194
LIAM: Yeah, let's do it in that workshop.

5559
03:38:39.194 --> 03:38:41.550
LAURA: Okay, let's go, well--
LIAM: This place is just as

5560
03:38:41.550 --> 03:38:43.843
creepy as the chamber down below.

5561
03:38:43.843 --> 03:38:45.893
TRAVIS: The study is a bit more cramped than the

5562
03:38:45.893 --> 03:38:48.226
workshop is.

5563
03:38:48.226 --> 03:38:49.059
LAURA: Okay.

5564
03:38:49.059 --> 03:38:51.557
TRAVIS: Or, I'm sorry, the experiment chamber,

5565
03:38:51.557 --> 03:38:53.051
because that's the only in-between point--

5566
03:38:53.051 --> 03:38:55.905
LIAM: The workshop was dry and warm.

5567
03:38:55.905 --> 03:38:58.971
And I can fix this automaton.

5568
03:38:58.971 --> 03:38:59.804
TRAVIS: Sure.
LAURA: Okay.

5569
03:38:59.804 --> 03:39:00.955
TALIESIN: That's a good plan.

5570
03:39:00.955 --> 03:39:02.134
LAURA: Let's do it, I guess.

5571
03:39:02.134 --> 03:39:04.507
We'll go back to the workshop.

5572
03:39:04.507 --> 03:39:05.494
MATT: Okay.

5573
03:39:05.494 --> 03:39:07.299
Heading back through the doorway

5574
03:39:07.299 --> 03:39:09.875
from the Permaheart study, you enter the experiment chamber

5575
03:39:09.875 --> 03:39:12.752
left as you left it.

5576
03:39:12.752 --> 03:39:16.083
The difference being all the bodies that had some semblance

5577
03:39:16.083 --> 03:39:19.637
of experimentation, both within or now shattered

5578
03:39:19.637 --> 03:39:21.875
on the ground, that were partially decomposed

5579
03:39:21.875 --> 03:39:24.993
or were still in a stasis position,

5580
03:39:24.993 --> 03:39:28.161
have all also blackened and begun to liquefy.

5581
03:39:28.161 --> 03:39:30.013
It looks like all things that are tethered

5582
03:39:30.013 --> 03:39:32.764
to the Permaheart within here have

5583
03:39:32.764 --> 03:39:35.931
lost their connection and maintenance.

5584
03:39:37.088 --> 03:39:38.872
TRAVIS: We move through there to the golem workshop.

5585
03:39:38.872 --> 03:39:39.743
MATT: Okay.

5586
03:39:39.743 --> 03:39:42.198
The door opens up and you enter the warm interior

5587
03:39:42.198 --> 03:39:44.563
of the golden workshop, just as you left it.

5588
03:39:44.563 --> 03:39:46.680
LAURA: Should I call Allura?

5589
03:39:46.680 --> 03:39:48.673
SAM: Are we going to rest here?

5590
03:39:48.673 --> 03:39:49.801
TALIESIN: Maybe a short rest.

5591
03:39:49.801 --> 03:39:53.602
LIAM: Call Allura, I'm going to start looking through

5592
03:39:53.602 --> 03:39:55.504
the instructions that are here and see if I can figure out

5593
03:39:55.504 --> 03:39:57.865
how to fix my robit.

5594
03:39:57.865 --> 03:39:59.054
LAURA: I call Allura.

5595
03:39:59.054 --> 03:40:00.278
MATT: Okay.

5596
03:40:00.278 --> 03:40:02.299
Allura answers.

5597
03:40:02.299 --> 03:40:03.132
"Hello.

5598
03:40:03.967 --> 03:40:05.712
"How goes everything?"

5599
03:40:05.712 --> 03:40:09.431
LAURA: Holy shit, Allura, we just killed the heart.

5600
03:40:09.431 --> 03:40:12.378
MATT: "Oh, so you managed to find what you were seeking."

5601
03:40:12.378 --> 03:40:16.612
LAURA: Well, sort of, we haven't found Yussa yet.

5602
03:40:18.329 --> 03:40:19.832
Does anything look different out there,

5603
03:40:19.832 --> 03:40:20.997
now that we've killed the heart?

5604
03:40:20.997 --> 03:40:22.601
Is the whole world changed?

5605
03:40:22.601 --> 03:40:24.061
SAM: (laughs)

5606
03:40:24.061 --> 03:40:25.309
MATT: "Let me look."

5607
03:40:25.309 --> 03:40:26.581
You see from the back of the mirror,

5608
03:40:26.581 --> 03:40:29.908
she goes to the edge of a window that overlooks

5609
03:40:29.908 --> 03:40:31.787
a cityscape around.

5610
03:40:31.787 --> 03:40:33.697
TRAVIS: It's just fire.
SAM: A cityscape!

5611
03:40:33.697 --> 03:40:35.601
MATT: From it looks like a tower position.

5612
03:40:35.601 --> 03:40:37.464
SAM: A tower position!

5613
03:40:37.464 --> 03:40:39.772
MATT: "No, looks about the same from my perspective,

5614
03:40:39.772 --> 03:40:43.149
"but I am quite a ways away from the place you call home."

5615
03:40:43.149 --> 03:40:44.221
LAURA: All right.

5616
03:40:44.221 --> 03:40:46.420
SAM: Is it warm where you are?

5617
03:40:46.420 --> 03:40:47.993
MATT: "It's relatively temperate."

5618
03:40:47.993 --> 03:40:50.111
TRAVIS: (laughs) It's the coast, of course.

5619
03:40:50.111 --> 03:40:51.883
LAURA: Well, have you heard anything else?

5620
03:40:51.883 --> 03:40:54.331
How long has it been since we talked to you?

5621
03:40:54.331 --> 03:40:57.428
MATT: "Since we last spoke, I believe it's been

5622
03:40:57.428 --> 03:41:00.476
"maybe a day and a half?"

5623
03:41:00.476 --> 03:41:02.040
LAURA: Okay, that's not so bad.

5624
03:41:02.040 --> 03:41:04.274
MARISHA: Oh yeah, that's actually pretty good.

5625
03:41:04.274 --> 03:41:06.259
LAURA: Well.
MATT: If I recall correctly.

5626
03:41:06.259 --> 03:41:08.479
LAURA: Good news, so if you feel like scrying

5627
03:41:08.479 --> 03:41:10.670
on the Laughing Hand or anything to see if he's just

5628
03:41:10.670 --> 03:41:13.320
lying in pain, let us know.

5629
03:41:14.796 --> 03:41:17.485
MATT: "Would you like me to scry them?"

5630
03:41:17.485 --> 03:41:18.588
TRAVIS: Yes.
LAURA: Yeah.

5631
03:41:18.588 --> 03:41:21.049
SAM: Can you scry on something you've never seen?

5632
03:41:21.049 --> 03:41:21.921
MARISHA: Yeah.

5633
03:41:21.921 --> 03:41:24.049
MATT: "I can certainly try. It's not easy."

5634
03:41:24.049 --> 03:41:26.500
LAURA: I describe exactly what he looks like.

5635
03:41:26.500 --> 03:41:30.602
Oh, I'm going to hold up my journal to the mirror

5636
03:41:30.602 --> 03:41:33.533
so she can see my drawing of the Laughing Hand.

5637
03:41:33.533 --> 03:41:34.744
See him, do you see?

5638
03:41:34.744 --> 03:41:36.225
He's got all these mouths and stuff.

5639
03:41:36.225 --> 03:41:39.003
SAM: I'll use Disguise Self to turn into--

5640
03:41:39.003 --> 03:41:39.836
MATT: Like a tiny version?

5641
03:41:39.836 --> 03:41:41.295
SAM: A tiny Laughing Hand.

5642
03:41:41.295 --> 03:41:43.604
(cackles)
MATT: "That is very disgusting.

5643
03:41:43.604 --> 03:41:45.265
"That is a very--"
LAURA: He's really gross.

5644
03:41:45.265 --> 03:41:46.365
TALIESIN: It's a lot to deal with.

5645
03:41:46.365 --> 03:41:47.409
MATT: "All right.

5646
03:41:47.409 --> 03:41:50.444
"It'll take me a moment, and she begins to--"

5647
03:41:50.444 --> 03:41:52.503
MARISHA: Can you like, put us on hold while you do that?

5648
03:41:52.503 --> 03:41:53.336
LAURA: This lasts for 10 minutes,

5649
03:41:53.336 --> 03:41:54.886
so we could be looking at her

5650
03:41:54.886 --> 03:41:56.878
while she's scrying if we want to.

5651
03:41:56.878 --> 03:42:00.252
MATT: The scry ritual takes how long to prepare?

5652
03:42:00.252 --> 03:42:01.830
LAURA: Oh.
SAM: 10 minutes.

5653
03:42:01.830 --> 03:42:03.348
LAURA: Well.

5654
03:42:03.348 --> 03:42:05.970
MATT: "You'll have to get back to me, if you don't mind,

5655
03:42:05.970 --> 03:42:07.332
"afterward."

5656
03:42:07.332 --> 03:42:09.394
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: "All right, well--"

5657
03:42:09.394 --> 03:42:10.923
LAURA: We'll hang up and call back immediately,

5658
03:42:10.923 --> 03:42:12.011
by then you will have done it.

5659
03:42:12.011 --> 03:42:13.011
MATT: "Most likely."

5660
03:42:13.011 --> 03:42:14.322
TALIESIN: We're going to keep looking for--

5661
03:42:14.322 --> 03:42:15.543
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: "All right."

5662
03:42:15.543 --> 03:42:18.112
And the connection dissipates.

5663
03:42:18.112 --> 03:42:19.468
LAURA: Well.
SAM: Call back.

5664
03:42:19.468 --> 03:42:21.844
MARISHA: One, two.

5665
03:42:21.844 --> 03:42:23.724
LAURA: Okay, I'm calling back.

5666
03:42:25.349 --> 03:42:26.432
MATT: "Okay."

5667
03:42:28.344 --> 03:42:29.860
Yeah.

5668
03:42:31.466 --> 03:42:36.143
"This entity is doing very poorly."

5669
03:42:36.143 --> 03:42:37.131
LAURA: (gasps)

5670
03:42:37.131 --> 03:42:38.832
MATT: "Extremely poorly."
LAURA: (gasps)

5671
03:42:38.832 --> 03:42:42.183
MATT: "When I was checking in, he was in the midst

5672
03:42:42.183 --> 03:42:45.874
"of being berated by an individual."

5673
03:42:45.874 --> 03:42:47.257
LAURA: Obann.

5674
03:42:48.113 --> 03:42:49.538
MATT: "Possibly.

5675
03:42:50.438 --> 03:42:53.927
"The flesh was sagging, and it was extremely lethargic,

5676
03:42:53.927 --> 03:42:55.489
"breathing heavy."

5677
03:42:55.489 --> 03:42:57.139
LAURA: Whoa!

5678
03:42:57.139 --> 03:42:59.306
MATT: "Yeah, so whatever you did, it seems to have had

5679
03:42:59.306 --> 03:43:02.056
"quite an impact on this creature.

5680
03:43:04.252 --> 03:43:07.668
"There was talk a bit of

5681
03:43:07.668 --> 03:43:09.533
"an event soon

5682
03:43:09.533 --> 03:43:14.160
"as part of this frustration, shouting at this beast,

5683
03:43:14.160 --> 03:43:19.104
"this Laughing Hand, about how it falls apart

5684
03:43:19.104 --> 03:43:20.854
"near the finish line.

5685
03:43:21.758 --> 03:43:24.165
"That's all I could ascertain."

5686
03:43:24.165 --> 03:43:25.478
LAURA: The finish line.

5687
03:43:25.478 --> 03:43:27.075
LIAM: I guess they're going to miss Traveler Con.

5688
03:43:27.075 --> 03:43:30.583
SAM: Any distinct timeline,

5689
03:43:30.583 --> 03:43:32.308
or due date or something?

5690
03:43:32.308 --> 03:43:35.958
MATT: "Not that I could take from the conversation."

5691
03:43:35.958 --> 03:43:38.704
LAURA: Did you see a woman there?

5692
03:43:38.704 --> 03:43:40.040
MATT: "Not immediately, no."

5693
03:43:40.040 --> 03:43:41.716
LAURA: Okay.

5694
03:43:41.716 --> 03:43:44.739
SAM: How about a--

5695
03:43:44.739 --> 03:43:46.816
Wasn't there another skull creature thing?

5696
03:43:46.816 --> 03:43:47.649
LAURA: Yeah.

5697
03:43:47.649 --> 03:43:49.995
Was it just the Obann guy and the Laughing Hand,

5698
03:43:49.995 --> 03:43:52.095
was there anyone else?
MATT: "That's all I saw for the time that I could."

5699
03:43:52.095 --> 03:43:53.829
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

5700
03:43:53.829 --> 03:43:55.364
SAM: Thank you.

5701
03:43:55.364 --> 03:43:57.012
LAURA: Thank you, Allura. We're going to, I guess,

5702
03:43:57.012 --> 03:43:59.426
try to find Yussa now. I'm not sure where he is.

5703
03:43:59.426 --> 03:44:01.983
We might have to sleep; I don't even know.

5704
03:44:01.983 --> 03:44:04.346
MARISHA: Got any more ideas where he might be

5705
03:44:04.346 --> 03:44:06.063
or what he might've been interested in?

5706
03:44:06.063 --> 03:44:08.055
MATT: "What parts have you not explored yet?"

5707
03:44:08.055 --> 03:44:09.723
LAURA: We haven't seen the Dreadnought yet.

5708
03:44:09.723 --> 03:44:13.161
MARISHA: We haven't seen the Dreadnought, the Bedroom--
LIAM: The Prison of Soot.

5709
03:44:13.161 --> 03:44:14.591
MARISHA: We haven't been to the Crystal Mines,

5710
03:44:14.591 --> 03:44:17.649
we haven't been to the Circlebound Chamber,

5711
03:44:17.649 --> 03:44:21.132
The Prison of Soot, the Carving Farm.

5712
03:44:21.132 --> 03:44:25.739
MATT: "Well, this could be in any of those or otherwise."

5713
03:44:25.739 --> 03:44:28.857
TRAVIS: There is something called the Bedroom.

5714
03:44:28.857 --> 03:44:33.255
TALIESIN: Would a Locate Creature spell work here?

5715
03:44:33.255 --> 03:44:34.288
TRAVIS: In these planes.

5716
03:44:34.288 --> 03:44:36.829
MATT: "It depends. That usually requires proximity,

5717
03:44:36.829 --> 03:44:38.963
"but the way you're describing the interior--"

5718
03:44:38.963 --> 03:44:40.651
SAM: Different dimensions.

5719
03:44:40.651 --> 03:44:42.271
TALIESIN: So it might just stop at the door.

5720
03:44:42.271 --> 03:44:43.791
MATT: "It might."

5721
03:44:43.791 --> 03:44:44.798
TALIESIN: Yeah, weird.

5722
03:44:44.798 --> 03:44:46.984
SAM: We're just going to have to room-to-room this thing.

5723
03:44:46.984 --> 03:44:47.817
TRAVIS: Yep.

5724
03:44:49.932 --> 03:44:51.933
SAM: There's a bunch of rooms, maybe we all take

5725
03:44:51.933 --> 03:44:53.350
a different room?

5726
03:44:53.350 --> 03:44:55.910
TRAVIS: (laughs) Yeah. I like it.

5727
03:44:55.910 --> 03:44:58.171
Allura, I think we'll be heading to the Dreadnought next.

5728
03:44:58.171 --> 03:45:00.753
We're not entirely sure what we'll find there,

5729
03:45:00.753 --> 03:45:03.808
but it seems some clues have led us in that direction.

5730
03:45:03.808 --> 03:45:07.308
MATT: "Well, take care. That sounds terrifying.

5731
03:45:08.965 --> 03:45:10.715
"All right, well, I'm going to go,

5732
03:45:10.715 --> 03:45:12.409
"because having to continue

5733
03:45:12.409 --> 03:45:15.702
"a conversation at this extremely slow pace

5734
03:45:15.702 --> 03:45:16.795
"is giving me a headache."

5735
03:45:16.795 --> 03:45:18.212
TRAVIS: Yes, of course.

5736
03:45:19.838 --> 03:45:22.146
SAM: (drawn-out) Goodbye!

5737
03:45:22.146 --> 03:45:24.912
MATT: "Don't make it worse, please. Goodbye."

5738
03:45:24.912 --> 03:45:29.101
The mirror goes to a reflective self.

5739
03:45:29.101 --> 03:45:32.465
TRAVIS: Shall we construct a dome, or would you like to

5740
03:45:32.465 --> 03:45:33.670
fix your robit first?

5741
03:45:33.670 --> 03:45:35.198
LIAM: Caleb has spent the last 10 minutes

5742
03:45:35.198 --> 03:45:38.780
futzing with instructions and looking at his golem.

5743
03:45:38.780 --> 03:45:42.662
MATT: So you're taking a long rest here.

5744
03:45:42.662 --> 03:45:44.485
LIAM: I'm going to trying to fix the golem, if I'm able to.

5745
03:45:44.485 --> 03:45:46.171
MATT: Fix the golem first, all right.
MARISHA: I'll help you.

5746
03:45:46.171 --> 03:45:48.295
MATT: The materials are fairly scarce, because you used

5747
03:45:48.295 --> 03:45:51.377
a lot of them to finish his construction.

5748
03:45:52.610 --> 03:45:55.720
Go ahead and make an arcana check for me.

5749
03:45:55.720 --> 03:45:57.492
LIAM: Stupid dice.

5750
03:45:57.492 --> 03:45:58.520
17.

5751
03:45:58.520 --> 03:46:00.169
MATT: 17?

5752
03:46:00.169 --> 03:46:01.166
(sighs)

5753
03:46:01.166 --> 03:46:03.766
You cannot find sufficient materials to repair him here,

5754
03:46:03.766 --> 03:46:05.070
unfortunately.

5755
03:46:05.070 --> 03:46:08.366
There's not enough to do significant repairs.

5756
03:46:08.366 --> 03:46:12.816
At most, to be able to repair him, I'd say

5757
03:46:12.816 --> 03:46:15.066
go ahead and roll 2d6.

5758
03:46:17.963 --> 03:46:18.946
LIAM: Nine.

5759
03:46:18.946 --> 03:46:20.923
MATT: Okay, so he heals nine hit points.

5760
03:46:20.923 --> 03:46:23.325
But that's the extent of what you're capable of doing.

5761
03:46:23.325 --> 03:46:26.143
The materials you use here are expended.

5762
03:46:26.143 --> 03:46:27.461
That's the extent of what the workshop

5763
03:46:27.461 --> 03:46:29.461
currently has available.

5764
03:46:31.782 --> 03:46:32.799
LIAM: Okay.

5765
03:46:32.799 --> 03:46:34.208
SAM: That's great, that's something.

5766
03:46:34.208 --> 03:46:35.666
LIAM: True.

5767
03:46:35.666 --> 03:46:36.632
TRAVIS: Dome?

5768
03:46:36.632 --> 03:46:37.593
Are we taking a long rest?

5769
03:46:37.593 --> 03:46:38.751
SAM: Dome it.

5770
03:46:38.751 --> 03:46:39.788
LAURA: Gosh, okay.

5771
03:46:39.788 --> 03:46:41.046
MATT: It's going to be eight more days,

5772
03:46:41.046 --> 03:46:42.529
just so you're aware.

5773
03:46:45.238 --> 03:46:46.450
MARISHA: Do you think we can afford it?

5774
03:46:46.450 --> 03:46:47.772
SAM: I'm okay for a short rest.

5775
03:46:47.772 --> 03:46:49.022
MARISHA: I'm fine with a short rest too,

5776
03:46:49.022 --> 03:46:50.330
but that's just me.
TRAVIS: I'm okay with a short rest.

5777
03:46:50.330 --> 03:46:53.025
LAURA: I'm almost out of spells, but that's my own fault,

5778
03:46:53.025 --> 03:46:53.866
I guess.

5779
03:46:53.866 --> 03:46:57.544
TRAVIS: No, we're going into the room, the area,

5780
03:46:57.544 --> 03:47:00.358
whatever it is, called the Dreadnought.
LIAM: The word "dread" in it.

5781
03:47:00.358 --> 03:47:01.737
TRAVIS: Let's rest.

5782
03:47:01.737 --> 03:47:03.083
MATT: It's your call.

5783
03:47:03.083 --> 03:47:04.814
TRAVIS: Let's do it, rest.

5784
03:47:04.814 --> 03:47:05.693
LIAM: I say we rest.

5785
03:47:05.693 --> 03:47:07.301
MATT: All right. So.

5786
03:47:07.301 --> 03:47:09.543
TRAVIS: Going to wish we had.
MATT: Eight hour rest.

5787
03:47:09.543 --> 03:47:11.293
SAM: Eight hour rest.

5788
03:47:12.452 --> 03:47:16.112
MATT: You all, shacking up in here, dome present,

5789
03:47:16.112 --> 03:47:18.212
have a long rest.

5790
03:47:20.162 --> 03:47:22.907
Which looking back at the rules, like,

5791
03:47:22.907 --> 03:47:24.326
the eight hour long rest, there can be someone

5792
03:47:24.326 --> 03:47:25.925
who takes two hours rest, so my apologies

5793
03:47:25.925 --> 03:47:27.374
in that last session.

5794
03:47:27.374 --> 03:47:30.904
So you can do two-hour watches for an eight hour.

5795
03:47:30.904 --> 03:47:32.536
TRAVIS: Oh, cool.
LAURA: Oh, okay.

5796
03:47:33.553 --> 03:47:34.744
MATT: You can do that for the

5797
03:47:34.744 --> 03:47:36.752
extent before the dome vanishes.

5798
03:47:38.132 --> 03:47:40.548
But I will say, for the sake of brevity here,

5799
03:47:40.548 --> 03:47:42.842
you're pretty safe within this chamber.

5800
03:47:42.842 --> 03:47:45.756
There aren't any incursions throughout the night.

5801
03:47:45.756 --> 03:47:50.124
You come eight hours later to the end of your rest restored,

5802
03:47:50.124 --> 03:47:52.565
hit points, spells rejuvenated.

5803
03:47:53.944 --> 03:47:56.480
What would you like to do?

5804
03:47:56.480 --> 03:47:57.974
SAM: Let's go to the fuckin' Dreadnought.

5805
03:47:57.974 --> 03:48:00.740
TRAVIS: Yeah, we'll make our way back into the

5806
03:48:00.740 --> 03:48:02.465
Experiment Chamber.

5807
03:48:02.465 --> 03:48:03.298
MATT: Okay.

5808
03:48:04.828 --> 03:48:08.898
SAM: Starting to become familiar with this place.

5809
03:48:08.898 --> 03:48:12.897
TALIESIN: I got an idea, I just need to, where's my--

5810
03:48:12.897 --> 03:48:14.864
SAM: Prep those spells, prep those spells.

5811
03:48:14.864 --> 03:48:17.195
TRAVIS: Prep-prep-prep those spells.

5812
03:48:18.570 --> 03:48:21.476
TALIESIN: I'm prepping Divination.

5813
03:48:22.968 --> 03:48:24.669
Which could be useful.

5814
03:48:24.669 --> 03:48:26.209
Before we go into the Dreadnought,

5815
03:48:26.209 --> 03:48:28.735
we could get some information really quickly.

5816
03:48:28.735 --> 03:48:30.316
TRAVIS: Oh, great.

5817
03:48:30.316 --> 03:48:31.311
LAURA: Okay, that's cool.

5818
03:48:31.311 --> 03:48:33.040
TALIESIN: I'm pretty good with everything else I've got.

5819
03:48:33.040 --> 03:48:34.574
Okay.

5820
03:48:34.574 --> 03:48:37.149
MATT: You all step back into the waterlogged

5821
03:48:37.149 --> 03:48:39.402
experimental chamber and you make your way

5822
03:48:39.402 --> 03:48:41.394
towards the other door, correct?

5823
03:48:41.394 --> 03:48:42.227
TALIESIN: Right before we do,

5824
03:48:42.227 --> 03:48:44.002
I'm going to ask for just 10 minutes

5825
03:48:44.002 --> 03:48:47.613
to have a conversation.

5826
03:48:47.613 --> 03:48:49.869
MATT: Well, it's an action to cast Divination.

5827
03:48:49.869 --> 03:48:51.566
TALIESIN: Is it?
MATT: Yeah.

5828
03:48:51.566 --> 03:48:52.799
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

5829
03:48:52.799 --> 03:48:54.445
MATT: All right, so.

5830
03:48:54.445 --> 03:48:58.999
As you expend the incense and sacrificial offering,

5831
03:48:58.999 --> 03:49:03.554
so you mark 25 gold off of your stuff there,

5832
03:49:03.554 --> 03:49:05.074
you get to ask a specific question.

5833
03:49:05.074 --> 03:49:07.793
What would you like to ask as you feel through the planes,

5834
03:49:07.793 --> 03:49:10.970
the warmth of the Wildmother's presence come and calm

5835
03:49:10.970 --> 03:49:13.054
the back of your mind at the precipice.

5836
03:49:13.054 --> 03:49:14.053
TALIESIN: Oh, what's his name again?

5837
03:49:14.053 --> 03:49:15.803
Because I keep saying Obann, incorrectly.

5838
03:49:16.761 --> 03:49:18.440
Who are looking for?

5839
03:49:18.440 --> 03:49:19.556
SAM: Yussa?
TALIESIN: Usa?

5840
03:49:19.556 --> 03:49:21.266
LAURA: Yussa.
TALIESIN: Yussa.

5841
03:49:22.174 --> 03:49:23.260
TRAVIS: You, sah.

5842
03:49:23.260 --> 03:49:25.558
TALIESIN: You sah, no you sah.

5843
03:49:26.507 --> 03:49:28.165
LIAM: Jar Jar Binks.

5844
03:49:28.165 --> 03:49:29.505
TALIESIN: Oh no.

5845
03:49:29.505 --> 03:49:31.964
TRAVIS: You-sa.

5846
03:49:31.964 --> 03:49:34.545
TALIESIN: Is Yussa in the Dreadnought?

5847
03:49:34.545 --> 03:49:35.786
MATT: That's the question you ask?

5848
03:49:35.786 --> 03:49:37.015
TALIESIN: The first question.

5849
03:49:37.015 --> 03:49:38.964
They have to be yes or no.

5850
03:49:38.964 --> 03:49:40.874
MATT: Divination is a single answer.

5851
03:49:40.874 --> 03:49:42.003
TALIESIN: Oh.

5852
03:49:42.003 --> 03:49:44.712
LAURA: Oh, it's different than what you were doing.

5853
03:49:44.712 --> 03:49:46.291
That's not Commune or whatever.

5854
03:49:46.291 --> 03:49:47.620
TALIESIN: That's not Commune?
MATT: Commune's different.

5855
03:49:47.620 --> 03:49:48.949
TALIESIN: Oh, I think I meant to do Commune then,

5856
03:49:48.949 --> 03:49:49.782
I'm so sorry.

5857
03:49:49.782 --> 03:49:51.248
MATT: Is Commune what you meant? I'll allow you to do that.

5858
03:49:51.248 --> 03:49:53.119
TALIESIN: I'm a little pokey at the moment.

5859
03:49:53.119 --> 03:49:56.312
LAURA: And Divination doesn't have to be yes or no?

5860
03:49:56.312 --> 03:50:01.242
MATT: The difference is Divination, you ask a question

5861
03:50:01.242 --> 03:50:03.506
concerning a specific event, goal or activity

5862
03:50:03.506 --> 03:50:06.190
to occur within seven days, and the DM offers

5863
03:50:06.190 --> 03:50:07.271
a truthful reply.

5864
03:50:07.271 --> 03:50:09.847
It can be a short phrase, cryptic rhyme or an omen.

5865
03:50:09.847 --> 03:50:11.343
Commune is what allows you ask three questions

5866
03:50:11.343 --> 03:50:13.051
of your deity.

5867
03:50:14.025 --> 03:50:15.749
TALIESIN: Seems like a good usage, take it.

5868
03:50:15.749 --> 03:50:16.898
And I'll take that map.

5869
03:50:16.898 --> 03:50:18.034
Okay, so yes, Commune.

5870
03:50:18.034 --> 03:50:18.867
MATT: Commune, okay.

5871
03:50:18.867 --> 03:50:20.593
In the same sense, it takes you a minute

5872
03:50:20.593 --> 03:50:22.916
as you build out the much larger ritual,

5873
03:50:22.916 --> 03:50:24.461
feel the presence of the Wildmother,

5874
03:50:24.461 --> 03:50:26.591
and the questions are?

5875
03:50:26.591 --> 03:50:30.408
TALIESIN: Is Yussa in the Dreadnought?

5876
03:50:32.095 --> 03:50:37.095
MATT: In this still chamber, the unhappy acrid smell

5877
03:50:37.454 --> 03:50:40.012
of acid and chemicals,

5878
03:50:40.895 --> 03:50:44.167
a warm breeze hits,

5879
03:50:44.167 --> 03:50:47.450
but it blows away from the Dreadnought door.

5880
03:50:47.450 --> 03:50:48.283
LAURA: Ooh.

5881
03:50:49.230 --> 03:50:50.397
SAM: Interesting.

5882
03:50:52.470 --> 03:50:54.479
TRAVIS: Is Yussa alive?

5883
03:50:56.605 --> 03:50:58.740
TALIESIN: Is Yussa alive?

5884
03:50:58.740 --> 03:51:01.445
MATT: The warm breeze now picks up from underneath

5885
03:51:01.445 --> 03:51:03.565
and you feel butterflies in the stomach.

5886
03:51:03.565 --> 03:51:04.673
A positive response.

5887
03:51:04.673 --> 03:51:05.915
SAM: Oh, okay.

5888
03:51:08.987 --> 03:51:10.381
SAM: Let's pick another room.

5889
03:51:10.381 --> 03:51:13.192
TALIESIN: Is Yussa in the Crystal Mines?

5890
03:51:13.192 --> 03:51:16.032
MATT: The breeze grows cold and still.

5891
03:51:16.032 --> 03:51:17.446
MARISHA: Damn it.

5892
03:51:17.446 --> 03:51:19.425
TRAVIS: Not in the Dreadnought and not in the Crystal Mines.

5893
03:51:19.425 --> 03:51:21.012
LIAM: Devil's circle room.

5894
03:51:21.012 --> 03:51:22.890
TALIESIN: That's all three of my questions.

5895
03:51:22.890 --> 03:51:24.266
LIAM: Oh, you did all three.

5896
03:51:24.266 --> 03:51:25.205
MARISHA: What's the one that gives you five?

5897
03:51:25.205 --> 03:51:26.482
MATT: You cast it again if you want to.

5898
03:51:26.482 --> 03:51:30.091
TALIESIN: I can. That's dangerous to cast.

5899
03:51:30.091 --> 03:51:31.802
LAURA: Oh, it is?
MARISHA: It's a 5th-level spell?

5900
03:51:31.802 --> 03:51:33.987
TALIESIN: Just for fun, I'm going to try Divine Intervention

5901
03:51:33.987 --> 03:51:36.739
to see if I can just get her to give me a specific location.

5902
03:51:38.639 --> 03:51:39.981
SAM: Percentile dice!

5903
03:51:39.981 --> 03:51:40.977
TALIESIN: 73.

5904
03:51:40.977 --> 03:51:42.533
MATT: No.
LAURA: I'm going to try, too!

5905
03:51:42.533 --> 03:51:44.499
MATT: Okay, go for it.
SAM: Percentile dice!

5906
03:51:44.499 --> 03:51:45.699
LAURA: Oh, your god didn't help?

5907
03:51:45.699 --> 03:51:47.309
Well, I'm going to see if mine will.

5908
03:51:47.309 --> 03:51:49.264
TALIESIN: Yeah, see if that happens.

5909
03:51:49.264 --> 03:51:50.151
SAM: It's a god-off.

5910
03:51:50.151 --> 03:51:52.956
TRAVIS and LAURA: ♪ Anything yours can do,
mine can do better ♪

5911
03:51:53.847 --> 03:51:55.589
LAURA: Aww, 23.
MATT: No.

5912
03:51:55.589 --> 03:51:58.074
MARISHA: One day, one day we'll see it work.

5913
03:51:58.074 --> 03:52:01.158
TRAVIS: One day. Pike did it once.

5914
03:52:01.158 --> 03:52:02.658
SAM: Can't you do it?

5915
03:52:04.249 --> 03:52:06.135
LAURA: No, Pike did it twice.

5916
03:52:06.135 --> 03:52:07.510
TALIESIN: It felt like a definitive

5917
03:52:07.510 --> 03:52:09.920
no on both of those, didn't it?

5918
03:52:09.920 --> 03:52:12.015
SAM: What's left? What are the other--

5919
03:52:12.015 --> 03:52:13.599
TALIESIN: There's the bedroom.

5920
03:52:13.599 --> 03:52:15.937
LAURA: I bet he's in the bedroom.
TALIESIN: The Fleshmend Facility.

5921
03:52:15.937 --> 03:52:17.381
LAURA: Maybe he's in the Fleshmend.

5922
03:52:17.381 --> 03:52:19.810
LIAM: That one with the goat head, that's promising name.

5923
03:52:19.810 --> 03:52:22.097
SAM: Carving farm? Jesus.

5924
03:52:22.097 --> 03:52:24.177
TRAVIS: (laughs) Is that what it's called?
SAM: Circlebound chamber?

5925
03:52:24.177 --> 03:52:26.542
LIAM: Circle-bound chamber.
Maybe he's trapped in some sort of--

5926
03:52:26.542 --> 03:52:30.052
SAM: We've omitted Crystal Mines, Garden, but we haven't--

5927
03:52:30.052 --> 03:52:31.610
TRAVIS: He's not in the Deadnought.

5928
03:52:31.610 --> 03:52:34.903
SAM: Not Dreadnought, not Experiment, not Perma, not Heart,

5929
03:52:34.903 --> 03:52:36.700
not Golem Workshop--

5930
03:52:36.700 --> 03:52:38.949
MATT: There are a number of notes
that point to the Deadnought.

5931
03:52:38.949 --> 03:52:40.134
Not Yussa specifically.

5932
03:52:40.134 --> 03:52:42.020
MARISHA: Yeah, but Halas.

5933
03:52:42.020 --> 03:52:42.857
LIAM: Halas, yeah.

5934
03:52:42.857 --> 03:52:44.952
LAURA: Something's in the Dreadnought.

5935
03:52:44.952 --> 03:52:48.521
SAM: But the divinity just said Yussa--

5936
03:52:48.521 --> 03:52:50.522
MATT: Yussa does not appear to be--

5937
03:52:50.522 --> 03:52:52.325
LAURA: But Hálas might be in the Dreadnought.

5938
03:52:52.325 --> 03:52:53.814
TRAVIS: Hálas? Halás?

5939
03:52:53.814 --> 03:52:55.482
MATT: Or his notes seem to point towards it.

5940
03:52:55.482 --> 03:52:56.695
TRAVIS: Still be alive?

5941
03:52:56.695 --> 03:52:58.062
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: Yes.

5942
03:52:58.062 --> 03:52:59.564
LAURA: Fully.

5943
03:52:59.564 --> 03:53:00.718
It would be like 10 years or something.

5944
03:53:00.718 --> 03:53:02.263
TALIESIN: Although probably really not happy.

5945
03:53:03.155 --> 03:53:05.198
SAM: Have we been to the Nest?
TRAVIS: He might not know.

5946
03:53:05.198 --> 03:53:06.335
Might be like Jumanji.

5947
03:53:06.335 --> 03:53:09.229
LIAM: It's also, with Halas' experience

5948
03:53:09.229 --> 03:53:12.375
with extraplanar pockets, he could have

5949
03:53:12.375 --> 03:53:14.302
shunted Yussa somewhere else.

5950
03:53:14.302 --> 03:53:16.190
Not in one of these chambers.

5951
03:53:16.190 --> 03:53:18.494
SAM: Well, there is a prison.

5952
03:53:18.494 --> 03:53:23.494
If Halas had captured Yussa, he could've brought

5953
03:53:23.620 --> 03:53:26.661
Yussa to the Prison of Soot.

5954
03:53:26.661 --> 03:53:29.562
We could either get there by going straight to the prison

5955
03:53:29.562 --> 03:53:31.865
or we could go there by going to Halas

5956
03:53:31.865 --> 03:53:33.802
and having him bring us there.
LAURA: Halas may be just a

5957
03:53:33.802 --> 03:53:36.657
soul trapped in a jar right now.

5958
03:53:36.657 --> 03:53:39.743
MARISHA: Halas could also be on the mainland, right?

5959
03:53:39.743 --> 03:53:41.039
He could be anywhere.

5960
03:53:41.039 --> 03:53:42.694
TRAVIS: How long would it take to get to the Prison of Soot?

5961
03:53:42.694 --> 03:53:44.749
How many stops that we haven't gone through yet?

5962
03:53:44.749 --> 03:53:48.468
SAM: We're in the Golem Workshop right now?

5963
03:53:48.468 --> 03:53:50.512
Oof, oof. Many.

5964
03:53:50.512 --> 03:53:52.156
LAURA: Oh jesus, how would we do it?

5965
03:53:52.156 --> 03:53:55.266
One, two, how would we get there?

5966
03:53:55.266 --> 03:53:56.672
TRAVIS: We should go through the Dreadnought.

5967
03:53:56.672 --> 03:53:59.896
LAURA: It would be one, two, three, four, five.

5968
03:53:59.896 --> 03:54:02.959
TALIESIN: I feel like there might be a third passage

5969
03:54:02.959 --> 03:54:03.917
in the Dreadnought.

5970
03:54:03.917 --> 03:54:06.442
SAM: We should go to the Dreadnought?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

5971
03:54:06.442 --> 03:54:07.336
MATT: Okay.

5972
03:54:07.336 --> 03:54:08.850
LAURA: But Halas isn't there.

5973
03:54:08.850 --> 03:54:11.655
SAM: Wait, Halas might be there, but Yussa's not.

5974
03:54:11.655 --> 03:54:12.705
LAURA: I mean, Yussa won't be there.

5975
03:54:12.705 --> 03:54:14.957
SAM: Yeah, but Halas might be able to take us to Yussa.

5976
03:54:14.957 --> 03:54:16.253
LIAM: May know something.

5977
03:54:16.253 --> 03:54:18.321
LAURA: Halas was thinking about becoming a lich.

5978
03:54:18.321 --> 03:54:20.338
LAURA and MARISHA: Yeah, Halas is not a good guy.

5979
03:54:20.338 --> 03:54:22.848
LIAM: Halas was trying to avoid being a lich.

5980
03:54:22.848 --> 03:54:25.224
LAURA: Because it was complicated, not because

5981
03:54:25.224 --> 03:54:27.114
he didn't think it was good.

5982
03:54:27.114 --> 03:54:29.935
LIAM: No, I don't think he's going to help us.

5983
03:54:29.935 --> 03:54:33.308
MARISHA: What good is finding Halas going to potentially do?

5984
03:54:33.308 --> 03:54:34.928
SAM: Could tell us where he is.

5985
03:54:34.928 --> 03:54:35.977
MARISHA: Why would he do that?

5986
03:54:35.977 --> 03:54:39.114
SAM: What can we give him?

5987
03:54:39.114 --> 03:54:40.330
MARISHA: He is a, like,

5988
03:54:40.330 --> 03:54:44.738
3000 year old wizard dude

5989
03:54:44.738 --> 03:54:47.523
and we're The Mighty Nein.

5990
03:54:47.523 --> 03:54:49.070
LAURA: Think about all the technical advances

5991
03:54:49.070 --> 03:54:50.307
we've made since then.
TALIESIN: We're the people who just

5992
03:54:50.307 --> 03:54:51.855
broke his immortality machine.

5993
03:54:51.855 --> 03:54:55.619
LAURA: Like, he's probably wearing just, like, underwear

5994
03:54:55.619 --> 03:54:57.631
because he doesn't even know what clothes are.

5995
03:54:57.631 --> 03:54:58.464
SAM and LAURA: Yeah.

5996
03:54:58.464 --> 03:55:00.037
SAM: We could show him buttons.

5997
03:55:00.037 --> 03:55:02.031
The technology of buttons.

5998
03:55:02.031 --> 03:55:04.051
TRAVIS: Are there zippers in this world?

5999
03:55:04.051 --> 03:55:06.318
SAM: I don't think so.
TRAVIS: Velcro?

6000
03:55:06.318 --> 03:55:08.963
SAM: Yes, there is velcro.

6001
03:55:08.963 --> 03:55:10.063
MARISHA: I agree with Caduceus.

6002
03:55:10.063 --> 03:55:12.379
We just broke his eternity machine,

6003
03:55:12.379 --> 03:55:14.344
his fountain of youth.

6004
03:55:14.344 --> 03:55:15.177
I don't think--

6005
03:55:15.177 --> 03:55:16.602
SAM: Maybe he doesn't know that.

6006
03:55:16.602 --> 03:55:19.152
TALIESIN: I'm pretty sure he knows that.

6007
03:55:19.152 --> 03:55:21.227
TRAVIS: Is it as difficult to get to the the--

6008
03:55:21.227 --> 03:55:23.078
TALIESIN: Everything that he built with it just rotted.

6009
03:55:23.078 --> 03:55:25.275
TRAVIS: Is it as difficult to get to the Prison of Soot

6010
03:55:25.275 --> 03:55:27.442
going backwards as it is going through the Dreadnought?

6011
03:55:27.442 --> 03:55:29.397
SAM: We would have to go to the Tower Machine,

6012
03:55:29.397 --> 03:55:30.867
where we've been.
LAURA: Yeah.

6013
03:55:30.867 --> 03:55:32.453
It's longer to go through the Dreadnought

6014
03:55:32.453 --> 03:55:33.528
to get to the Prison of Soot.

6015
03:55:33.528 --> 03:55:36.894
SAM: Then to the Garden again, find another door

6016
03:55:36.894 --> 03:55:39.881
that we haven't found yet, go to the study,

6017
03:55:39.881 --> 03:55:41.555
and go to the Circlebound Chamber,

6018
03:55:41.555 --> 03:55:44.023
in which there is a pentagram and a goat's head.

6019
03:55:44.023 --> 03:55:46.234
TRAVIS: The Prison of Soot is just a guess.

6020
03:55:46.234 --> 03:55:47.655
SAM: Then to the Prison of Soot.

6021
03:55:47.655 --> 03:55:48.664
LAURA: It's just a guess.

6022
03:55:48.664 --> 03:55:49.599
SAM: And we don't know if he's there.

6023
03:55:49.599 --> 03:55:50.432
LAURA: And we might accidentally

6024
03:55:50.432 --> 03:55:52.807
go to the Carving Farm instead,

6025
03:55:52.807 --> 03:55:53.768
which sounds very--

6026
03:55:53.768 --> 03:55:55.054
TRAVIS: Yeah, we should go to the Dreadnought.

6027
03:55:55.054 --> 03:55:57.307
We don't have anything pointing us to the Prison of Soot.

6028
03:55:57.307 --> 03:55:58.352
TALIESIN: The Dreadnought may have doors

6029
03:55:58.352 --> 03:56:00.881
that haven't been discovered yet.
LAURA: I think he's in the Fleshmend Facility.

6030
03:56:00.881 --> 03:56:03.234
SAM: Do you just like saying that?

6031
03:56:03.234 --> 03:56:05.764
TALIESIN: I think it's better to go places we haven't been,

6032
03:56:05.764 --> 03:56:07.383
even if we, yeah.

6033
03:56:07.383 --> 03:56:08.994
SAM: The flesh trees facility?

6034
03:56:08.994 --> 03:56:10.035
TRAVIS: Caleb, would you like to

6035
03:56:10.035 --> 03:56:11.318
take a look at that purple gem

6036
03:56:11.318 --> 03:56:13.024
and see if you can activate it?

6037
03:56:13.024 --> 03:56:14.504
LAURA: Oh god.

6038
03:56:14.504 --> 03:56:15.910
LIAM: I examined it before.

6039
03:56:15.910 --> 03:56:20.050
MATT: It doesn't appear to be
an activation more than a marker.

6040
03:56:20.050 --> 03:56:21.494
No one's tried the door.

6041
03:56:21.494 --> 03:56:23.794
LIAM: Nott, could you, do you see anything hinky

6042
03:56:23.794 --> 03:56:26.047
with this doorway?

6043
03:56:26.047 --> 03:56:28.326
SAM: Sure, it's in the room we're in?

6044
03:56:28.326 --> 03:56:29.159
MATT: Yeah.

6045
03:56:29.159 --> 03:56:30.587
It's on the opposite end of where you entered originally.

6046
03:56:30.587 --> 03:56:32.240
SAM: I will inspect.

6047
03:56:32.240 --> 03:56:34.211
Wait, give me Guidance.

6048
03:56:34.211 --> 03:56:36.280
MATT: (laughs)

6049
03:56:36.280 --> 03:56:37.363
TRAVIS: Nice catch.

6050
03:56:39.774 --> 03:56:40.659
SAM: 26.

6051
03:56:40.659 --> 03:56:42.608
MATT: 26 to?

6052
03:56:42.608 --> 03:56:44.501
SAM: I'm looking for--?

6053
03:56:44.501 --> 03:56:45.722
MATT: Traps, locks, okay.

6054
03:56:45.722 --> 03:56:47.533
The door is not locked, it is not trapped,

6055
03:56:47.533 --> 03:56:49.321
from what you can tell.

6056
03:56:49.321 --> 03:56:50.154
SAM: Clear!

6057
03:56:51.890 --> 03:56:53.930
Should I open it?

6058
03:56:53.930 --> 03:56:55.338
TRAVIS: I can.

6059
03:56:59.436 --> 03:57:02.538
MATT: You open it. A cold wind blows through

6060
03:57:02.538 --> 03:57:05.504
and you can see a faint, fuzzy purple color

6061
03:57:05.504 --> 03:57:08.247
ahead of you, but your vision can't really

6062
03:57:08.247 --> 03:57:10.576
focus on it. It's like something continuously blurs

6063
03:57:10.576 --> 03:57:12.312
what's beyond whatever threshold there is.

6064
03:57:12.312 --> 03:57:16.395
It looks to be about 15 feet from the entrance of this door.

6065
03:57:16.395 --> 03:57:18.796
SAM: It's another one of these things.

6066
03:57:18.796 --> 03:57:20.775
LAURA: We fight something else, we're going to have to take

6067
03:57:20.775 --> 03:57:23.349
another long rest, that's another week.

6068
03:57:23.349 --> 03:57:24.182
MARISHA: Yeah, I feel like we really

6069
03:57:24.182 --> 03:57:25.872
can't take another week.

6070
03:57:25.872 --> 03:57:28.846
SAM: We're just inspecting.

6071
03:57:28.846 --> 03:57:31.588
We have nowhere else to go that we know.

6072
03:57:31.588 --> 03:57:35.908
LAURA: I know, but, we know for a fact Yussa's

6073
03:57:35.908 --> 03:57:37.775
not in the Dreadnought.

6074
03:57:37.775 --> 03:57:41.503
SAM: We also know for a fact that there's 75% of this place

6075
03:57:41.503 --> 03:57:44.307
that's unmapped.

6076
03:57:44.307 --> 03:57:45.974
MATT: That is very true.

6077
03:57:47.965 --> 03:57:49.449
LIAM: This is a definitive direction.

6078
03:57:49.449 --> 03:57:52.145
LAURA: I could cast Commune.

6079
03:57:52.145 --> 03:57:53.615
TRAVIS: Jester, are you worried about something

6080
03:57:53.615 --> 03:57:55.173
with the passage of time?

6081
03:57:55.173 --> 03:57:56.535
TALIESIN: Do you want to cast Commune?

6082
03:57:56.535 --> 03:57:58.613
LAURA: I could cast Commune with the Traveler.

6083
03:57:58.613 --> 03:58:01.241
TALIESIN: We could ask three more rooms.

6084
03:58:01.241 --> 03:58:02.074
MATT: It's up to you.

6085
03:58:02.074 --> 03:58:03.932
TRAVIS: Are you worried about missing Traveler Con?

6086
03:58:03.932 --> 03:58:05.260
LAURA: Obviously!

6087
03:58:05.260 --> 03:58:06.810
It was coming up, Fjord!

6088
03:58:06.810 --> 03:58:08.181
TRAVIS: How soon?

6089
03:58:08.181 --> 03:58:09.523
I have not--

6090
03:58:09.523 --> 03:58:11.060
LAURA: I don't know how much time is passing in here,

6091
03:58:11.060 --> 03:58:12.934
I don't understand it completely,

6092
03:58:12.934 --> 03:58:17.594
but you know, it was like a couple, like eight weeks away

6093
03:58:17.594 --> 03:58:19.184
when we got in here, so.

6094
03:58:19.184 --> 03:58:20.787
MATT: It was a little longer than that. Like 10 weeks away.

6095
03:58:20.787 --> 03:58:22.631
LAURA: It was like 10 weeks away or something, I don't know,

6096
03:58:22.631 --> 03:58:23.464
I'm bad with time.

6097
03:58:23.464 --> 03:58:25.814
TRAVIS: And Allura had said that we've been gone for about?

6098
03:58:25.814 --> 03:58:27.179
LAURA: Two already, over.

6099
03:58:27.179 --> 03:58:29.462
MATT: You've been gone, since now knowing the hours

6100
03:58:29.462 --> 03:58:31.452
you've spent out there.

6101
03:58:31.452 --> 03:58:33.529
MARISHA: Two weeks.

6102
03:58:33.529 --> 03:58:37.107
MATT: You've been gone for roughly, I have to look at

6103
03:58:37.107 --> 03:58:40.527
the full calendar, but like 22 days, around there.

6104
03:58:40.527 --> 03:58:41.806
TALIESIN: Almost three weeks,

6105
03:58:41.806 --> 03:58:43.622
We're doing all right.

6106
03:58:44.838 --> 03:58:47.261
LAURA: Well, I can cast Commune if you guys want me to.

6107
03:58:47.261 --> 03:58:49.746
TALIESIN: I'd say burn a 5th-level maybe, yeah.

6108
03:58:49.746 --> 03:58:53.163
LAURA: All right, I'm going to sit down.

6109
03:58:54.211 --> 03:58:56.129
TALIESIN: Lets pick three.

6110
03:58:56.129 --> 03:58:58.424
Prison of Soot seems interesting.

6111
03:58:58.424 --> 03:59:00.107
LAURA: Let's ask about the prison.

6112
03:59:00.107 --> 03:59:01.107
TALIESIN: Bedroom?

6113
03:59:01.107 --> 03:59:03.232
SAM: We're just asking for the location of Yussa, right?

6114
03:59:03.232 --> 03:59:05.149
MATT: You can ask all sorts of questions too.

6115
03:59:05.149 --> 03:59:06.361
It's your call.

6116
03:59:06.361 --> 03:59:08.757
TALIESIN: Any other ideas?

6117
03:59:08.757 --> 03:59:10.723
LAURA: It has to be yes or no.
MARISHA: I have a sneaking suspicion

6118
03:59:10.723 --> 03:59:13.950
he is nowhere on that map.

6119
03:59:13.950 --> 03:59:15.487
TALIESIN: We could ask that question.

6120
03:59:15.487 --> 03:59:17.131
MARISHA: Maybe start with that.

6121
03:59:17.131 --> 03:59:20.326
Is he anywhere on this map that's already been mapped out?

6122
03:59:20.326 --> 03:59:23.392
MATT: Okay, so you take a minute to set up the ritual.

6123
03:59:23.392 --> 03:59:26.026
Whereas Caduceus set up all these beautiful little

6124
03:59:26.026 --> 03:59:28.328
natural little trinkets

6125
03:59:28.328 --> 03:59:30.233
and incense burned around there.

6126
03:59:30.233 --> 03:59:31.585
LAURA: Doodles all around me on the ground.

6127
03:59:31.585 --> 03:59:33.432
MATT: Yeah, you draw all sorts of little creatures

6128
03:59:33.432 --> 03:59:37.404
and big little stone penises in the circle around you.

6129
03:59:37.404 --> 03:59:39.385
As you cast the spell--

6130
03:59:39.385 --> 03:59:42.732
LAURA: A little mouse flipping everybody off on the ground.

6131
03:59:42.732 --> 03:59:44.262
MATT: A smell of vanilla fills the space,

6132
03:59:44.262 --> 03:59:47.132
which all of you recognize.

6133
03:59:47.132 --> 03:59:49.272
You sense two hands on your shoulder,

6134
03:59:49.272 --> 03:59:53.493
and you see the hood come into peripheral and say,

6135
03:59:53.493 --> 03:59:55.126
"How can I help you?"

6136
03:59:55.126 --> 03:59:57.666
LAURA: Well, okay, here's the thing.

6137
03:59:57.666 --> 03:59:59.528
We're looking for this guy, Yussa.

6138
03:59:59.528 --> 04:00:03.172
We don't know where the fuck he is; this place is crazy.

6139
04:00:04.138 --> 04:00:07.369
Is he anywhere on this map that we have?

6140
04:00:07.369 --> 04:00:09.724
MATT: The hood of the Traveler leans forward

6141
04:00:09.724 --> 04:00:12.873
and glances across the paper.

6142
04:00:12.873 --> 04:00:15.962
"I think he's somewhere on this map, yeah.

6143
04:00:15.962 --> 04:00:17.735
"Yes, I believe so."

6144
04:00:17.735 --> 04:00:19.770
LAURA: Okay, that's good, that's good to know.

6145
04:00:19.770 --> 04:00:23.129
TRAVIS: Do we want to ask if Halas is on the map?

6146
04:00:23.129 --> 04:00:25.844
MARISHA: Is in this map, yeah.

6147
04:00:25.844 --> 04:00:29.527
LAURA: I mean, do we want to waste a question?

6148
04:00:29.527 --> 04:00:30.793
Oh, I'm not going to ask him that.

6149
04:00:30.793 --> 04:00:34.297
Almost asked him a question. That would have been real bad.

6150
04:00:34.297 --> 04:00:35.762
TRAVIS: It's either that or two locations, right?

6151
04:00:35.762 --> 04:00:38.195
LAURA: I think we should get
a couple more locations, honestly.

6152
04:00:38.195 --> 04:00:40.572
MARISHA: If we get Halas, then we might know

6153
04:00:40.572 --> 04:00:44.037
if we're dealing with a wannabe demilich.

6154
04:00:44.037 --> 04:00:46.707
SAM: Come on, don't you guys want to go to the Dreadnought?

6155
04:00:46.707 --> 04:00:48.023
TRAVIS: Oh, I totally do, yeah.

6156
04:00:48.023 --> 04:00:49.849
Ask your locations. It's your Commune.

6157
04:00:49.849 --> 04:00:52.189
MARISHA: We know he's not in the Dreadnought.

6158
04:00:52.189 --> 04:00:55.297
LAURA: Is he in the...

6159
04:00:56.222 --> 04:00:57.747
Bedroom?

6160
04:00:59.280 --> 04:01:03.457
MATT: The Traveler's image flickers a bit.

6161
04:01:03.457 --> 04:01:05.000
"I don't sense him there."

6162
04:01:05.000 --> 04:01:06.739
LAURA: Fuck!

6163
04:01:06.739 --> 04:01:08.151
Okay, I'm going to ask about that one.

6164
04:01:08.151 --> 04:01:10.818
TRAVIS: Which one?
LAURA: (whispered) The Prison of Soot.

6165
04:01:10.818 --> 04:01:14.451
Is he in the Prison of Soot?

6166
04:01:14.451 --> 04:01:18.175
MATT: The hood comes into focus a bit and goes,

6167
04:01:18.175 --> 04:01:21.335
"I mean, if I were to capture errant mages

6168
04:01:21.335 --> 04:01:24.074
"that wandered your halls or trespassing,

6169
04:01:24.074 --> 04:01:25.258
"where would you put them?"

6170
04:01:25.258 --> 04:01:29.066
LAURA: (gasps) Traveler, you're so smart, thank you so much!

6171
04:01:29.066 --> 04:01:30.849
MATT: You see a little eye wink from under the hood

6172
04:01:30.849 --> 04:01:32.296
as the image of vanishes.

6173
04:01:32.296 --> 04:01:35.937
LAURA: You guys, my god is the coolest god.

6174
04:01:35.937 --> 04:01:39.954
You chose the wrong when you were picking your new one.

6175
04:01:39.954 --> 04:01:42.038
He's in the Prison of Soot.

6176
04:01:42.038 --> 04:01:43.533
TALIESIN: You did all right.

6177
04:01:43.533 --> 04:01:45.728
TRAVIS: Well, we should check out the Dreadnought.

6178
04:01:45.728 --> 04:01:47.620
MATT: You stand at the open precipice

6179
04:01:47.620 --> 04:01:49.739
of the purple doorway on the other side.

6180
04:01:49.739 --> 04:01:52.231
TALIESIN: There's a couple of rooms we haven't been to,

6181
04:01:52.231 --> 04:01:53.520
so we can make our way--

6182
04:01:53.520 --> 04:01:55.928
TRAVIS: One of us could go through

6183
04:01:55.928 --> 04:01:57.175
and just pop out and look in.

6184
04:01:57.175 --> 04:01:59.100
SAM: We could look and see what it is.

6185
04:01:59.100 --> 04:02:00.999
TALIESIN: We still get to
go through the Circlebound Chamber,

6186
04:02:00.999 --> 04:02:02.512
that's exciting.

6187
04:02:02.512 --> 04:02:04.722
SAM: You could just pop in, pop out.

6188
04:02:04.722 --> 04:02:07.152
TALIESIN: Then the door auto-locks behind you.

6189
04:02:07.152 --> 04:02:08.171
LAURA: Do whatever you want.

6190
04:02:08.171 --> 04:02:10.429
MATT: What are you doing?

6191
04:02:11.429 --> 04:02:14.532
TRAVIS: Oh, the Dreadnought's so far away.

6192
04:02:14.532 --> 04:02:17.642
So one, two, three, four, five.

6193
04:02:17.642 --> 04:02:19.067
Holy shit, now we

6194
04:02:19.067 --> 04:02:21.811
can't even fucking get there.
MARISHA: But we have to anyway, though, because--

6195
04:02:21.811 --> 04:02:23.625
LAURA: No, we don't.

6196
04:02:23.625 --> 04:02:26.174
TRAVIS: One, two, three, four.

6197
04:02:26.174 --> 04:02:27.757
LIAM: We can do here, here.

6198
04:02:27.757 --> 04:02:29.642
MARISHA: No, wait.
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

6199
04:02:29.642 --> 04:02:30.633
LAURA: I know, it's complicated.

6200
04:02:30.633 --> 04:02:32.499
MARISHA: No, no, we go through the Study.
SAM: We need Waze.

6201
04:02:32.499 --> 04:02:33.998
LAURA: We do.

6202
04:02:33.998 --> 04:02:37.647
MARISHA: Yeah, so you go Dreadnought, Crystal Mines, Garden.

6203
04:02:37.647 --> 04:02:38.480
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

6204
04:02:38.480 --> 04:02:40.915
LAURA: I wish I could cast
Commune again; that was really fun.

6205
04:02:40.915 --> 04:02:41.912
TALIESIN: Then you're out of fifths.

6206
04:02:41.912 --> 04:02:44.055
LAURA: He was so like, present, you know?

6207
04:02:44.055 --> 04:02:46.597
Like he's always here, but this one felt like,

6208
04:02:46.597 --> 04:02:48.474
I could feel his hands on my shoulders, you know?

6209
04:02:48.474 --> 04:02:51.189
SAM: Are you in love with him?

6210
04:02:51.189 --> 04:02:53.446
MARISHA: Well, no, four, five--

6211
04:02:53.446 --> 04:02:54.646
SAM: Really?

6212
04:02:54.646 --> 04:02:56.196
LAURA: I mean, he's really wonderful.

6213
04:02:56.196 --> 04:02:58.662
Who wouldn't be in love with him, you know?

6214
04:02:59.734 --> 04:03:01.036
SAM: Do you think he loves you?

6215
04:03:01.036 --> 04:03:03.623
LAURA: Of course he loves me, he loves me so much.

6216
04:03:03.623 --> 04:03:06.162
But not in the right way.

6217
04:03:06.162 --> 04:03:08.674
TRAVIS: The Dreadnought path is the exact same distance

6218
04:03:08.674 --> 04:03:09.996
as if we went backwards.

6219
04:03:09.996 --> 04:03:11.601
TALIESIN: Except two more unknown rooms

6220
04:03:11.601 --> 04:03:13.758
as opposed to less than two unknown rooms.

6221
04:03:13.758 --> 04:03:15.971
MARISHA: Six, seven, no, you're right.

6222
04:03:15.971 --> 04:03:17.033
It's technically shorter.

6223
04:03:17.033 --> 04:03:18.855
LIAM: So a little faster, but--

6224
04:03:18.855 --> 04:03:19.823
TRAVIS: What is?

6225
04:03:19.823 --> 04:03:21.014
LIAM: The Dreadnought path is one--

6226
04:03:21.014 --> 04:03:23.769
MARISHA: It's actually one more faster, but he's right.

6227
04:03:23.769 --> 04:03:26.187
We'd go through more unknowns.

6228
04:03:26.187 --> 04:03:28.243
MATT: What's the plan?

6229
04:03:28.243 --> 04:03:29.926
SAM: Half of us go through the Dreadnought,

6230
04:03:29.926 --> 04:03:31.980
and half of us go the other way.

6231
04:03:31.980 --> 04:03:33.940
MARISHA: We'll see who gets there.

6232
04:03:33.940 --> 04:03:35.057
MATT: Perfect.

6233
04:03:35.057 --> 04:03:36.859
LAURA: Let's roll a d20.

6234
04:03:36.859 --> 04:03:38.015
SAM: For what?

6235
04:03:38.015 --> 04:03:39.857
LAURA: Anything above 10, Dreadnought.

6236
04:03:39.857 --> 04:03:41.636
Anything below 10, we go the other way.

6237
04:03:41.636 --> 04:03:43.194
LIAM: I don't want to put it up to chance.

6238
04:03:43.194 --> 04:03:44.437
I want to agree. I think we should

6239
04:03:44.437 --> 04:03:46.692
go through the Dreadnought.

6240
04:03:46.692 --> 04:03:48.023
TALIESIN: Why?

6241
04:03:48.023 --> 04:03:51.978
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's a good question, why?

6242
04:03:51.978 --> 04:03:53.308
SAM: Because we'll know more.

6243
04:03:53.308 --> 04:03:55.650
LIAM: I want to understand this place.

6244
04:03:55.650 --> 04:03:57.450
TALIESIN: I think that's dangerous,

6245
04:03:57.450 --> 04:03:59.249
and that there is no understanding this place,

6246
04:03:59.249 --> 04:04:00.654
but if it's what you want to do.

6247
04:04:00.654 --> 04:04:03.387
TRAVIS: The Dreadnought path has three unknown rooms.

6248
04:04:03.387 --> 04:04:05.420
Going backwards has...

6249
04:04:08.987 --> 04:04:09.820
one.

6250
04:04:11.457 --> 04:04:12.639
SAM: One?

6251
04:04:12.639 --> 04:04:15.001
LAURA: Well, not including the prison, yeah.

6252
04:04:15.001 --> 04:04:17.463
TALIESIN: I really do want to see
the crystal cave a little bit.

6253
04:04:17.463 --> 04:04:19.092
TRAVIS: The Crystal Mines, the Dreadnought,

6254
04:04:19.092 --> 04:04:22.492
and the Circlebound Chamber.

6255
04:04:22.492 --> 04:04:24.684
TALIESIN: If you really want to go, I'll do this.

6256
04:04:24.684 --> 04:04:26.426
MARISHA: I would like to remind everyone that

6257
04:04:26.426 --> 04:04:30.901
this Happy Fun Ball also
has the nickname of the Mage's Bane,

6258
04:04:30.901 --> 04:04:32.798
and we are searching for a mage,

6259
04:04:32.798 --> 04:04:36.087
who's been locked up for being super overly curious.

6260
04:04:36.087 --> 04:04:39.914
So yeah, you know, we could go through the Dreadnought.

6261
04:04:39.914 --> 04:04:41.997
LIAM: Good, we're agreed.

6262
04:04:43.610 --> 04:04:45.721
TRAVIS: I'm very curious.

6263
04:04:45.721 --> 04:04:47.898
LAURA: Well, you guys are both arcane users,

6264
04:04:47.898 --> 04:04:49.934
so that would make sense that, you know,

6265
04:04:49.934 --> 04:04:51.581
the two of you would be the ones that--

6266
04:04:51.581 --> 04:04:52.745
TRAVIS: Are you not an arcane user?

6267
04:04:52.745 --> 04:04:54.575
MARISHA: I was being a little sarcastic.
LAURA: I'm a cleric.

6268
04:04:54.575 --> 04:04:56.629
TALIESIN: No, I got that.

6269
04:04:56.629 --> 04:05:00.531
LAURA: My power comes from a different place.

6270
04:05:00.531 --> 04:05:02.783
TRAVIS: (snorts)

6271
04:05:02.783 --> 04:05:05.078
Yes, my mistake.

6272
04:05:05.078 --> 04:05:06.145
MATT: What's the plan?

6273
04:05:06.145 --> 04:05:09.295
MARISHA: I'm curious as well, but

6274
04:05:11.329 --> 04:05:14.011
we have Traveler Con on the horizon.

6275
04:05:14.011 --> 04:05:15.675
SAM: What a weird sentence.

6276
04:05:15.675 --> 04:05:16.697
(laughter)

6277
04:05:16.697 --> 04:05:18.787
TALIESIN: Of all the weirder sentences.
LIAM: Wait a minute, wait a minute.

6278
04:05:18.787 --> 04:05:21.348
Are we having a meeting or are we playing D&amp;D?

6279
04:05:21.348 --> 04:05:22.989
(laughter)

6280
04:05:22.989 --> 04:05:25.511
MARISHA: D&amp;D is nothing but a bunch of meetings.

6281
04:05:25.511 --> 04:05:27.603
MATT: I mean, partially.

6282
04:05:30.393 --> 04:05:31.337
MARISHA: I don't know.

6283
04:05:31.337 --> 04:05:34.372
TRAVIS: The video gamer in me wants to see the levels.

6284
04:05:34.372 --> 04:05:38.072
I'm having an amazing time in this fucking ball.

6285
04:05:38.072 --> 04:05:39.099
SAM: (laughs)

6286
04:05:39.099 --> 04:05:41.765
TALIESIN: You know, I feel like

6287
04:05:41.765 --> 04:05:43.854
you get overridden a lot, Caleb.

6288
04:05:43.854 --> 04:05:45.767
I'm with you.

6289
04:05:45.767 --> 04:05:47.583
I feel like we tell you no a lot.

6290
04:05:47.583 --> 04:05:50.194
So yeah, I'll tell you yes on this one.

6291
04:05:50.194 --> 04:05:51.135
I'm in it.

6292
04:05:51.135 --> 04:05:55.669
Just be careful and be careful with us.

6293
04:05:55.669 --> 04:05:58.382
LAURA: I feel like the power of
this place is sucking you in.

6294
04:05:58.382 --> 04:05:59.598
But.

6295
04:06:01.290 --> 04:06:03.944
MARISHA: Get a little nervous like Jester.

6296
04:06:03.944 --> 04:06:05.827
TALIESIN: I think as long as you promise to

6297
04:06:05.827 --> 04:06:08.756
not go off by yourself and--

6298
04:06:08.756 --> 04:06:11.682
LAURA: You have to promise, Caleb,
you're not going to do that.

6299
04:06:11.682 --> 04:06:14.075
TALIESIN: Pay attention to us and make sure that you don't

6300
04:06:14.075 --> 04:06:15.635
trigger anything, just be very careful.

6301
04:06:15.635 --> 04:06:17.938
MARISHA: We just watched him a few hours ago

6302
04:06:17.938 --> 04:06:21.066
stare into a door for, like, a while.

6303
04:06:21.066 --> 04:06:24.698
LAURA: I know, he keeps staring at things
really creepily in here.

6304
04:06:24.698 --> 04:06:27.409
MARISHA: Then you sent your cat forward and down a door

6305
04:06:27.409 --> 04:06:32.409
when the rule that Captain Tusktooth

6306
04:06:32.710 --> 04:06:37.650
put forth was to call out your actions like a lifeguard.

6307
04:06:37.650 --> 04:06:39.958
(laughter)

6308
04:06:39.958 --> 04:06:41.105
TALIESIN: I didn't follow any of that.

6309
04:06:41.105 --> 04:06:42.641
SAM: I missed some of it.

6310
04:06:42.641 --> 04:06:45.332
LIAM: I did not understand that.

6311
04:06:48.802 --> 04:06:53.738
But I would rather you put your faith in me

6312
04:06:53.738 --> 04:06:57.254
for something

6313
04:06:57.254 --> 04:07:00.699
more important than my curiosity.

6314
04:07:00.699 --> 04:07:02.616
Let's go the other way.

6315
04:07:04.038 --> 04:07:05.538
SAM: Not Dreadnought?

6316
04:07:07.192 --> 04:07:09.316
LIAM: What are you saying your name is?

6317
04:07:09.316 --> 04:07:11.950
SAM: Dread Nott or Dread yes?

6318
04:07:13.049 --> 04:07:15.272
MATT: What are you guys doing? What's your plan?

6319
04:07:15.272 --> 04:07:16.443
MARISHA: We're talking about it.

6320
04:07:16.443 --> 04:07:17.443
MATT: All right.

6321
04:07:19.917 --> 04:07:22.134
SAM: What could it hurt to pop in and just see

6322
04:07:22.134 --> 04:07:23.472
what it's like, right?

6323
04:07:23.472 --> 04:07:24.850
We could just pop right back.

6324
04:07:24.850 --> 04:07:25.987
TRAVIS: Check out the view.

6325
04:07:25.987 --> 04:07:28.643
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay.

6326
04:07:28.643 --> 04:07:30.544
Let's pop in, check out the view.

6327
04:07:30.544 --> 04:07:31.609
TRAVIS: Yep.

6328
04:07:31.609 --> 04:07:35.071
MARISHA: If shit looks real bad, real fast, we're out.

6329
04:07:35.071 --> 04:07:36.264
SAM: Yeah.

6330
04:07:36.264 --> 04:07:39.116
It's the thing you always say, pop pop.

6331
04:07:39.116 --> 04:07:40.459
MARISHA: Pop pop.

6332
04:07:40.459 --> 04:07:42.953
TRAVIS: Jester, are you worried about the time

6333
04:07:42.953 --> 04:07:45.081
and missing Traveler Con?

6334
04:07:45.081 --> 04:07:48.523
You've been waiting years, right?

6335
04:07:48.523 --> 04:07:51.399
LAURA: Well, I only knew about it recently, so no.

6336
04:07:51.399 --> 04:07:53.534
TRAVIS: But you don't want to miss it.

6337
04:07:53.534 --> 04:07:55.503
TALIESIN: Retroactively waiting years.

6338
04:07:56.512 --> 04:07:57.521
LAURA: It's fine, you guys.

6339
04:07:57.521 --> 04:07:58.632
TALIESIN: You'd have to be in here a long time.

6340
04:07:58.632 --> 04:08:00.215
LAURA: This place worries me is all.

6341
04:08:00.215 --> 04:08:01.907
But we can go in.

6342
04:08:02.915 --> 04:08:05.536
TRAVIS: I'm confident we can handle anything,

6343
04:08:05.536 --> 04:08:08.277
as long as we're together.

6344
04:08:08.277 --> 04:08:10.472
LIAM: Counter argument.

6345
04:08:10.472 --> 04:08:12.055
SAM: Counter argument.

6346
04:08:13.069 --> 04:08:16.122
LIAM: We do not go through the Dreadnought.

6347
04:08:16.122 --> 04:08:18.002
We go the other way.

6348
04:08:18.002 --> 04:08:19.408
We get Yussa.

6349
04:08:19.408 --> 04:08:23.224
We go to Traveler Con, and we come back.

6350
04:08:24.087 --> 04:08:24.920
TALIESIN: Agreed.

6351
04:08:28.237 --> 04:08:31.244
I want to see that crystal cave.

6352
04:08:31.244 --> 04:08:32.244
Sounds nice.

6353
04:08:34.409 --> 04:08:35.709
TRAVIS: I suppose.

6354
04:08:38.126 --> 04:08:40.178
MARISHA: What do we do, what do we do?

6355
04:08:40.178 --> 04:08:41.816
TALIESIN: All right.
MATT: What are you guys doing?

6356
04:08:41.816 --> 04:08:42.826
Are you having a look?

6357
04:08:42.826 --> 04:08:44.507
Are you turning the other way?

6358
04:08:44.507 --> 04:08:46.573
Are you going through or staying?

6359
04:08:46.573 --> 04:08:48.130
SAM: This is very realistic.

6360
04:08:48.130 --> 04:08:50.336
LIAM: Everything sucks in every direction.

6361
04:08:50.336 --> 04:08:52.548
SAM: This is how this group makes decisions.

6362
04:08:52.548 --> 04:08:55.472
TRAVIS: We'll take a peek and then we'll go backward

6363
04:08:55.472 --> 04:08:56.492
to one unknown room.

6364
04:08:56.492 --> 04:08:58.558
MARISHA: Okay, here's the rules, though.

6365
04:08:58.558 --> 04:09:00.751
MARISHA: Here's the fucking rules.

6366
04:09:00.751 --> 04:09:02.347
MATT: Peak D&amp;D right now.

6367
04:09:02.347 --> 04:09:03.363
MARISHA: You're not going to get weird.

6368
04:09:03.363 --> 04:09:06.372
You're not going to stare down weird corridors.

6369
04:09:06.372 --> 04:09:08.361
You're not going to cast spells.

6370
04:09:08.361 --> 04:09:11.443
We're all going to hold hands, we're going to buddy system.

6371
04:09:11.443 --> 04:09:13.715
LAURA: We're going to peek and pop right back out.

6372
04:09:13.715 --> 04:09:16.316
MARISHA: Okay, this is the astral sea we're fuckin' with.

6373
04:09:16.316 --> 04:09:17.901
I just want to point out.

6374
04:09:17.901 --> 04:09:21.724
TRAVIS: We're doing elementary hand holding chain.

6375
04:09:21.724 --> 04:09:24.468
MARISHA: Yeah, because shit gets sucked into the astral sea

6376
04:09:24.468 --> 04:09:25.843
and is never seen again!

6377
04:09:25.843 --> 04:09:27.664
TRAVIS: Grab that fuckin' wizard's hand.

6378
04:09:27.664 --> 04:09:29.331
We're walking through that magic door.

6379
04:09:29.331 --> 04:09:30.956
LAURA: I have a feeling the minute we go through

6380
04:09:30.956 --> 04:09:32.971
he's going to go, "I let go of everyone's hands."

6381
04:09:32.971 --> 04:09:34.248
(laughter)

6382
04:09:34.248 --> 04:09:36.285
TRAVIS: She's got higher strength than he does.

6383
04:09:36.285 --> 04:09:38.309
Ready, one, two, three.

6384
04:09:38.309 --> 04:09:39.853
(shouting)

6385
04:09:39.853 --> 04:09:41.466
MATT: You all leap through.

6386
04:09:41.466 --> 04:09:42.608
As you step through,

6387
04:09:42.608 --> 04:09:44.974
you drift forward, the purple--
LIAM: I let go!

6388
04:09:44.974 --> 04:09:47.159
(laughter)
TRAVIS: Rainbow bridge.

6389
04:09:47.159 --> 04:09:50.600
MATT: The purple door comes your way, and as it passes by,

6390
04:09:50.600 --> 04:09:54.882
you all find yourself not touching the ground,

6391
04:09:54.882 --> 04:09:57.240
but just drifting there.

6392
04:09:57.240 --> 04:09:59.351
MARISHA: Nope, nope.
LAURA: Is there a door?

6393
04:09:59.351 --> 04:10:00.979
MARISHA: We're drifting.

6394
04:10:00.979 --> 04:10:04.139
MATT: Hold on, my queue crashed.

6395
04:10:04.139 --> 04:10:06.291
My audio queue.
TRAVIS: We're already falling.

6396
04:10:06.291 --> 04:10:07.128
MATT: It's all good.

6397
04:10:07.128 --> 04:10:10.090
SAM: We're perpetually falling for the rest of our lives.

6398
04:10:10.090 --> 04:10:11.726
LAURA: ♪ Game over ♪
MATT: No, you're fine.

6399
04:10:11.726 --> 04:10:15.294
TALIESIN: We can take a long rest, set some new spells

6400
04:10:15.294 --> 04:10:17.474
while we're falling.

6401
04:10:17.474 --> 04:10:19.380
MATT: No, you're fine.

6402
04:10:19.380 --> 04:10:21.247
SAM: Play the heartbeat again.

6403
04:10:21.247 --> 04:10:22.917
MATT: Play the heartbeat again?

6404
04:10:22.917 --> 04:10:25.609
MARISHA: Nope. Nope.
MATT: Nah, nah.

6405
04:10:25.609 --> 04:10:29.714
No, you managed to push past that, you're fine.

6406
04:10:29.714 --> 04:10:30.581
All right, let me try--

6407
04:10:30.581 --> 04:10:32.535
TALIESIN: I feel like maybe destroying that heart

6408
04:10:32.535 --> 04:10:35.060
possibly made stuff easier up ahead,

6409
04:10:35.060 --> 04:10:37.539
or made stuff angrier, I don't know.

6410
04:10:37.539 --> 04:10:40.103
MATT: All right, there we go.

6411
04:10:41.911 --> 04:10:44.491
As you come through, you find yourself

6412
04:10:44.491 --> 04:10:47.856
just stationary, drifting.

6413
04:10:47.856 --> 04:10:49.457
LAURA: Is our hair going floaty?

6414
04:10:49.457 --> 04:10:51.610
MATT: Yeah, your feet touch no ground,

6415
04:10:51.610 --> 04:10:54.502
your hair floats a bit, and your body gently glides

6416
04:10:54.502 --> 04:10:56.861
without direction away from the open portal behind you,

6417
04:10:56.861 --> 04:10:58.848
which doesn't close.

6418
04:10:58.848 --> 04:11:01.302
Drifting to a slow stop, and you're all

6419
04:11:01.302 --> 04:11:03.975
holding hands, just drifting.

6420
04:11:03.975 --> 04:11:07.544
Gravity holds no sway here, not in the way you know it.

6421
04:11:07.544 --> 04:11:10.184
Surrounding you in every direction is a sea of swirling,

6422
04:11:10.184 --> 04:11:12.876
silvery mists and curling winds,

6423
04:11:12.876 --> 04:11:16.760
an expanse of soft gray and white dots.

6424
04:11:16.760 --> 04:11:20.284
Distant points of light like distant stars of a night sky.

6425
04:11:20.284 --> 04:11:23.999
The door behind you is built into a massive, rough island

6426
04:11:23.999 --> 04:11:26.543
of dull cerulean rock that sits adrift

6427
04:11:26.543 --> 04:11:30.688
in this strange place, but what really catches your eye

6428
04:11:30.688 --> 04:11:33.366
are the numerous platinum chains,

6429
04:11:33.366 --> 04:11:36.671
maybe a dozen or so, thick platinum chains

6430
04:11:36.671 --> 04:11:38.667
that are bolted tightly to and wrapped around

6431
04:11:38.667 --> 04:11:40.933
this dark blue rock before pulling

6432
04:11:40.933 --> 04:11:42.409
to the creature that they restrain.

6433
04:11:42.409 --> 04:11:43.971
LAURA: (gasps)

6434
04:11:43.971 --> 04:11:46.137
MATT: Just below the door,

6435
04:11:46.137 --> 04:11:49.179
about 30 or so feet from the island,

6436
04:11:49.179 --> 04:11:52.050
and about 25 or so feet from you,

6437
04:11:52.050 --> 04:11:55.198
rests a terrifying behemoth that challenges

6438
04:11:55.198 --> 04:11:57.452
the darkest of your nightmares.

6439
04:11:57.452 --> 04:11:59.097
SAM: This is way worse than I thought.

6440
04:11:59.097 --> 04:12:00.428
(laughter)

6441
04:12:00.428 --> 04:12:03.510
MATT: A hulking beast covered in spiky armored plates

6442
04:12:03.510 --> 04:12:05.854
resembling a bulbous swollen serpent

6443
04:12:05.854 --> 04:12:08.474
with a silvery tail that seems to curl and drift

6444
04:12:08.474 --> 04:12:11.200
infinitely towards the distant skies,

6445
04:12:11.200 --> 04:12:14.648
tethered to an impossible distance on the horizon.

6446
04:12:14.648 --> 04:12:16.718
The hardened pale flesh plates that surround it

6447
04:12:16.718 --> 04:12:18.942
are veiny and smooth, almost slick,

6448
04:12:18.942 --> 04:12:20.944
while its muscles tense against the numerous chains

6449
04:12:20.944 --> 04:12:23.296
that surround it.

6450
04:12:23.296 --> 04:12:25.171
At its front where it faces you,

6451
04:12:25.171 --> 04:12:27.993
a trunk-like a torso carries two thick muscular arms

6452
04:12:27.993 --> 04:12:30.411
that end in terrifying pincers,

6453
04:12:30.411 --> 04:12:33.112
also held by the same thick silvery bands

6454
04:12:33.112 --> 04:12:33.981
and chains to the rock.

6455
04:12:33.981 --> 04:12:38.716
It is bound and unable to move to this rock.

6456
04:12:38.716 --> 04:12:41.645
Between the fleshy shoulder sits a gargantuan face crested

6457
04:12:41.645 --> 04:12:43.651
with horned ridges along the brow,

6458
04:12:43.651 --> 04:12:45.338
and the corners of the immense jaw,

6459
04:12:45.338 --> 04:12:48.280
where hundreds of two-foot teeth layer and tangle

6460
04:12:48.280 --> 04:12:50.782
around the edges of a 12 foot wide mouth,

6461
04:12:50.782 --> 04:12:52.948
ever dripping a thick, clear saliva

6462
04:12:52.948 --> 04:12:55.112
that drips from its chin and then floats

6463
04:12:55.112 --> 04:12:57.567
near the space around, as well as the two heavy chains

6464
04:12:57.567 --> 04:12:59.868
that connect to the sides of its mouth.

6465
04:12:59.868 --> 04:13:03.506
Two of these just built into the sides of its jaw.

6466
04:13:03.506 --> 04:13:06.948
Noseless, a singular eye would sit above the mouth,

6467
04:13:06.948 --> 04:13:11.929
were it not covered by a platinum plate bolted to its brow.

6468
04:13:13.213 --> 04:13:15.737
And there you sit, floating as it just sits there,

6469
04:13:15.737 --> 04:13:20.687
bound, blinded, chains attached to it,

6470
04:13:20.687 --> 04:13:22.234
with the door behind you.

6471
04:13:22.234 --> 04:13:24.460
You spin around and look, and you see

6472
04:13:24.460 --> 04:13:28.752
two large levers framing each side of the door.

6473
04:13:31.449 --> 04:13:34.435
TRAVIS: Maybe we should go back.
MARISHA: Nope, nope, nope!

6474
04:13:34.435 --> 04:13:36.863
We are looking at the face of an elder god.

6475
04:13:36.863 --> 04:13:38.000
This is insane!

6476
04:13:38.000 --> 04:13:41.022
LIAM: Any other structures, or is it just infinity

6477
04:13:41.022 --> 04:13:41.935
around all this?

6478
04:13:41.935 --> 04:13:43.222
MATT: Make a perception check.

6479
04:13:43.222 --> 04:13:45.047
SAM: I was expecting some boxes.

6480
04:13:45.047 --> 04:13:46.801
TALIESIN: I will assist you in that perception check.

6481
04:13:46.801 --> 04:13:49.272
SAM: Some shelves, maybe?

6482
04:13:49.272 --> 04:13:50.282
He needs to inspect.

6483
04:13:50.282 --> 04:13:51.370
TRAVIS: You have advantage.

6484
04:13:51.370 --> 04:13:53.325
LIAM: I cannot, all right.

6485
04:13:53.325 --> 04:13:55.492
The first one's cocked.

6486
04:13:56.425 --> 04:13:57.565
15.

6487
04:13:57.565 --> 04:13:58.398
MATT: 15?

6488
04:14:00.027 --> 04:14:01.793
Just those two levers,

6489
04:14:01.793 --> 04:14:04.352
and the rocky island there.
TRAVIS: The door's still open, right?

6490
04:14:04.352 --> 04:14:05.302
MATT: Yeah, still open.

6491
04:14:05.302 --> 04:14:07.647
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm on the end of the human chain,

6492
04:14:07.647 --> 04:14:11.080
Should I try some NASA astronaut-like propulsion

6493
04:14:11.080 --> 04:14:12.661
to send us back towards the door?

6494
04:14:12.661 --> 04:14:15.548
MATT: As you begin to will yourself that direction,

6495
04:14:15.548 --> 04:14:16.729
you float that direction.

6496
04:14:16.729 --> 04:14:17.655
LAURA: Oh.

6497
04:14:17.655 --> 04:14:19.746
MATT: You see Fjord and do that,

6498
04:14:19.746 --> 04:14:21.387
you begin to just will yourself to move

6499
04:14:21.387 --> 04:14:23.405
and your body drifts.

6500
04:14:23.405 --> 04:14:26.774
The speed you move is three times your intelligence score.

6501
04:14:26.774 --> 04:14:28.267
(laughter)

6502
04:14:28.267 --> 04:14:30.753
So Caleb and Beauregard in the space

6503
04:14:30.753 --> 04:14:31.830
can travel quicker than anybody,

6504
04:14:31.830 --> 04:14:35.241
and Caduceus is holding up the caboose. The cabuceus.

6505
04:14:35.241 --> 04:14:37.492
TALIESIN: 30 feet.

6506
04:14:37.492 --> 04:14:39.056
MARISHA: Okay.

6507
04:14:39.056 --> 04:14:40.905
Back, right? Back?

6508
04:14:40.905 --> 04:14:42.598
TALIESIN: We know now, back.

6509
04:14:42.598 --> 04:14:45.066
SAM: Did the monster notice us?

6510
04:14:45.066 --> 04:14:46.580
MATT: It hasn't moved.

6511
04:14:46.580 --> 04:14:47.624
TRAVIS: No, let's just--

6512
04:14:47.624 --> 04:14:50.154
LAURA: Hey, is this that serpent creature

6513
04:14:50.154 --> 04:14:52.244
that we saw in those drawings?

6514
04:14:52.244 --> 04:14:53.077
SAM: Oh.

6515
04:14:53.077 --> 04:14:54.140
LAURA: Do you guys remember?

6516
04:14:54.140 --> 04:14:55.156
LIAM: It doesn't look like that.

6517
04:14:55.156 --> 04:14:57.965
TRAVIS: Big arms and pincers? No?

6518
04:14:57.965 --> 04:15:00.363
MATT: No. You can make an arcana check.

6519
04:15:01.646 --> 04:15:04.560
TALIESIN: (mumbling)

6520
04:15:04.560 --> 04:15:05.393
LIAM: 24.

6521
04:15:05.393 --> 04:15:08.512
LAURA: Guidance?
TALIESIN: Ah, nevermind.

6522
04:15:08.512 --> 04:15:11.720
MATT: You had your suspicions.

6523
04:15:11.720 --> 04:15:14.914
But this is an astral dreadnought.

6524
04:15:14.914 --> 04:15:15.749
They are--

6525
04:15:15.749 --> 04:15:18.220
TRAVIS: It really is an astral dreadnought?

6526
04:15:18.220 --> 04:15:22.940
MATT: That is bound and chained to this island.

6527
04:15:22.940 --> 04:15:26.132
It is unmoving at the moment.

6528
04:15:26.132 --> 04:15:27.636
It doesn't notice your presence.

6529
04:15:27.636 --> 04:15:30.935
It seems like it is dormant.

6530
04:15:30.935 --> 04:15:32.649
TRAVIS: Let's take it.

6531
04:15:32.649 --> 04:15:36.112
LAURA: This poor dreadnought needs water.
TRAVIS: I think it has, like, 600 hit points.

6532
04:15:36.112 --> 04:15:39.040
MATT: The only things you notice are the numerous chains

6533
04:15:39.040 --> 04:15:42.457
that bind it to this island, and then the chains

6534
04:15:42.457 --> 04:15:45.516
seem to cluster around two of these levers.

6535
04:15:45.516 --> 04:15:47.402
TRAVIS: You know you go to the zoo and you want to see the--

6536
04:15:47.402 --> 04:15:49.390
LIAM: Is it taut, tight, the way it's held?

6537
04:15:49.390 --> 04:15:51.219
Or is it just like loosey-goosey?

6538
04:15:51.219 --> 04:15:53.802
MATT: No, there's a couple that are pretty loose,

6539
04:15:53.802 --> 04:15:55.581
but most of them are pretty taut, and some of the--

6540
04:15:55.581 --> 04:15:56.884
it's bound in different directions to where

6541
04:15:56.884 --> 04:15:58.358
it's held suspended.

6542
04:15:58.358 --> 04:16:00.366
LAURA: What do you say, we let it go?

6543
04:16:00.366 --> 04:16:02.266
LIAM: It's on a giant island?
SAM: As we go though the door,

6544
04:16:02.266 --> 04:16:03.727
I can just shoot at the chains.

6545
04:16:03.727 --> 04:16:05.842
MATT: You guys are between this giant rock island

6546
04:16:05.842 --> 04:16:07.076
and you floated out of the doorway

6547
04:16:07.076 --> 04:16:08.971
that's on this island where the two levers are,

6548
04:16:08.971 --> 04:16:11.626
and all the chains are coming around you

6549
04:16:11.626 --> 04:16:13.438
and bound around this creature.

6550
04:16:13.438 --> 04:16:15.526
TRAVIS: Willing ourselves through the door.

6551
04:16:15.526 --> 04:16:17.161
LAURA: I really want to pull one of those levers.

6552
04:16:17.161 --> 04:16:18.174
TRAVIS: 42 feet.

6553
04:16:18.174 --> 04:16:20.053
SAM: Want to leave a dick in here or something?

6554
04:16:20.053 --> 04:16:21.456
MATT: You can make an investigation check to see

6555
04:16:21.456 --> 04:16:22.289
what the levers do.
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to

6556
04:16:22.289 --> 04:16:23.764
roll an investigation check.

6557
04:16:23.764 --> 04:16:24.898
TRAVIS: Nothing--
SAM: I'll do the other one.

6558
04:16:24.898 --> 04:16:26.906
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: Nothing good.

6559
04:16:26.906 --> 04:16:28.994
SAM: Oh, terrible.
LAURA: Terrible.

6560
04:16:28.994 --> 04:16:29.827
SAM: Guidance.

6561
04:16:29.827 --> 04:16:31.539
(laughter)

6562
04:16:31.539 --> 04:16:33.195
LAURA: Three!
SAM: 13.

6563
04:16:33.195 --> 04:16:34.289
TRAVIS: 25.

6564
04:16:34.289 --> 04:16:36.317
MATT: You both have no idea what these levers do.

6565
04:16:36.317 --> 04:16:38.726
SAM: One of them you pull.

6566
04:16:38.726 --> 04:16:39.812
LAURA: Oh, I think you pull them.

6567
04:16:39.812 --> 04:16:40.803
TRAVIS: Going through the door.

6568
04:16:40.803 --> 04:16:42.099
MARISHA: Okay, okay.
TRAVIS: Through the door.

6569
04:16:42.099 --> 04:16:43.620
MARISHA: We've seen it, right? We've seen it?

6570
04:16:43.620 --> 04:16:46.502
LIAM: Am I able to ascertain looking
at the levers and the chains?

6571
04:16:46.502 --> 04:16:49.383
MATT: Make an investigation check.
TRAVIS: It's not a ship, it's not a plane--

6572
04:16:49.383 --> 04:16:52.274
LIAM: 22.
MATT: 22, okay.

6573
04:16:52.274 --> 04:16:53.783
TRAVIS: Fucking death panther.

6574
04:16:53.783 --> 04:16:58.571
MATT: The left lever seems to be,
you now see as you get close,

6575
04:16:58.571 --> 04:17:02.646
it's connected to many, many of these chains around.

6576
04:17:02.646 --> 04:17:05.172
You can see there's actually within this island,

6577
04:17:05.172 --> 04:17:07.608
what initially you didn't notice, intricate little bits

6578
04:17:07.608 --> 04:17:11.322
of clockwork that weave behind and the lever on the left,

6579
04:17:11.322 --> 04:17:14.987
if pulled, would probably release all of the chains.

6580
04:17:14.987 --> 04:17:15.832
SAM: Okay.

6581
04:17:15.832 --> 04:17:18.175
MATT: The lever on the right seems to be affixed to a

6582
04:17:18.175 --> 04:17:20.532
network that connects directly to the two chains

6583
04:17:20.532 --> 04:17:23.340
that attached to its sides of its jaw.

6584
04:17:23.340 --> 04:17:25.236
You gather, if they were pulled,

6585
04:17:25.236 --> 04:17:27.320
it might force the jaw open.

6586
04:17:27.320 --> 04:17:31.419
SAM: Oh, so he can feed things to the dreadnought.

6587
04:17:31.419 --> 04:17:33.948
LAURA: So he keeps it alive or something?

6588
04:17:33.948 --> 04:17:35.758
SAM: Feed his enemies to it.

6589
04:17:35.758 --> 04:17:37.992
TALIESIN: Or it breathes some sort of--

6590
04:17:37.992 --> 04:17:39.872
MARISHA: Well, we read in the notes, right,

6591
04:17:39.872 --> 04:17:44.872
that this is how he discarded of the failed experiments.

6592
04:17:46.182 --> 04:17:50.288
If all of these experiments that you, bonus, you generate-

6593
04:17:50.288 --> 04:17:54.974
MATT: He said the bodies were
jettisoned into the astral sea.

6594
04:17:54.974 --> 04:17:56.924
MARISHA: Right. That's what I'm saying.

6595
04:17:56.924 --> 04:18:01.901
MATT: In the last bit of the notes that you read,

6596
04:18:01.901 --> 04:18:04.651
regarding this,

6597
04:18:04.651 --> 04:18:07.519
dealt with one of his ritual chambers

6598
04:18:07.519 --> 04:18:08.900
within the dreadnought.

6599
04:18:08.900 --> 04:18:11.625
LAURA: Within the dread-- he can go inside the dreadnought.

6600
04:18:11.625 --> 04:18:14.563
You can pull it open and go inside.

6601
04:18:14.563 --> 04:18:16.497
TRAVIS: He was inside Moby Dick.

6602
04:18:16.497 --> 04:18:17.416
LAURA: Oh my god.

6603
04:18:17.416 --> 04:18:18.306
SAM: Should we go in?

6604
04:18:18.306 --> 04:18:19.674
Just to see, just to see what it's like.

6605
04:18:19.674 --> 04:18:21.420
LAURA: We'll open its mouth and go inside of it?

6606
04:18:21.420 --> 04:18:22.892
MARISHA: That's probably where the portal is

6607
04:18:22.892 --> 04:18:24.375
to the crystal mines.

6608
04:18:24.375 --> 04:18:26.387
LAURA: Really fucking cool.

6609
04:18:26.387 --> 04:18:28.283
MATT: You can make a perception check if you want.

6610
04:18:28.283 --> 04:18:30.135
MARISHA: Can I?
TRAVIS: Jester, do you want to go in?

6611
04:18:30.135 --> 04:18:31.472
TALIESIN: I'll help with that.

6612
04:18:31.472 --> 04:18:34.558
LAURA: I never knew we could go inside of a big--

6613
04:18:34.558 --> 04:18:35.581
MARISHA: Perception?

6614
04:18:35.581 --> 04:18:36.810
Okay, 15.

6615
04:18:36.810 --> 04:18:38.829
MATT: 15?

6616
04:18:38.829 --> 04:18:41.354
As you look towards the dreadnought and look around

6617
04:18:41.354 --> 04:18:44.462
back at the island, there was actually another door,

6618
04:18:44.462 --> 04:18:47.687
about 30 or so feet below, the one that you're at,

6619
04:18:47.687 --> 04:18:49.229
that is closed.
SAM: That's the way to the crystal mines.

6620
04:18:49.229 --> 04:18:52.611
TALIESIN: Do we want to-- that'll
actually save us some time.

6621
04:18:52.611 --> 04:18:53.444
SAM: Will it?

6622
04:18:53.444 --> 04:18:55.096
TALIESIN: Well no, actually, it won't.

6623
04:18:55.096 --> 04:18:58.953
MARISHA: You said sacrifice chamber inside the dreadnought?

6624
04:18:58.953 --> 04:19:00.456
MATT: Ritual chamber.

6625
04:19:00.456 --> 04:19:02.352
TRAVIS: I'm interested in what Jester said.

6626
04:19:02.352 --> 04:19:04.563
Do you want to go in the astral dreadnought?

6627
04:19:04.563 --> 04:19:06.224
SAM: Why would we go inside the dreadnought?

6628
04:19:06.224 --> 04:19:08.757
TALIESIN: Wait, what did he say?

6629
04:19:08.757 --> 04:19:11.328
LIAM: DM, with the keen mind, was it that the jar

6630
04:19:11.328 --> 04:19:13.230
was within here? I'm trying to remember.

6631
04:19:13.230 --> 04:19:17.031
MATT: It seemed to be his experimentation
with this magic jar,

6632
04:19:17.031 --> 04:19:18.592
a part of his soul transference,

6633
04:19:18.592 --> 04:19:21.861
that that particular part of his research

6634
04:19:21.861 --> 04:19:25.042
ended him heading towards the ritual chamber

6635
04:19:25.042 --> 04:19:26.798
within the dreadnought.

6636
04:19:26.798 --> 04:19:27.931
TALIESIN: Oh.

6637
04:19:30.432 --> 04:19:32.516
TRAVIS: Jester, you want to go inside?

6638
04:19:32.516 --> 04:19:35.216
LIAM: What, that room there?

6639
04:19:35.216 --> 04:19:37.003
LAURA: Well, maybe.

6640
04:19:37.003 --> 04:19:38.473
TALIESIN: I mean, maybe.

6641
04:19:38.473 --> 04:19:40.851
LAURA: Maybe going from inside the dreadnought

6642
04:19:40.851 --> 04:19:42.553
would take us to the circle bound chamber?

6643
04:19:42.553 --> 04:19:47.411
SAM: Or maybe we end up in his butthole.

6644
04:19:48.927 --> 04:19:50.328
TALIESIN: Within the Dreadnought.

6645
04:19:50.328 --> 04:19:53.217
LIAM: Yeah, we might be meeting Halas within here,

6646
04:19:53.217 --> 04:19:56.476
although we might be meeting him in any of these chambers.

6647
04:19:56.476 --> 04:19:59.418
But it seems like he has a bachelor pad inside this.

6648
04:19:59.418 --> 04:20:03.377
LAURA: I would go in the behemoth thing.

6649
04:20:03.377 --> 04:20:05.734
I think it's really cool.

6650
04:20:05.734 --> 04:20:07.150
MARISHA: We were not even going to
come in here to begin with.

6651
04:20:07.150 --> 04:20:10.605
LAURA: Yeah, but inside the thing!
SAM: I want to leave!

6652
04:20:10.605 --> 04:20:11.935
LAURA: We could go in it!

6653
04:20:11.935 --> 04:20:15.845
TRAVIS: Okay, hands for going in
the giant astral dreadnought.

6654
04:20:15.845 --> 04:20:16.982
LIAM: Caduceus has a good suggestion.

6655
04:20:16.982 --> 04:20:18.253
TALIESIN: I have a thought.

6656
04:20:18.253 --> 04:20:19.830
LIAM: Frumpkin is floating between my hands.

6657
04:20:19.830 --> 04:20:20.663
MATT: Uh-huh.

6658
04:20:20.663 --> 04:20:22.239
SAM: Frumpkin's going in?
LAURA: We should open the mouth, though.

6659
04:20:22.239 --> 04:20:24.574
LIAM: Yes, while I send Frumpkin up

6660
04:20:24.574 --> 04:20:26.807
and just float him right in front of--

6661
04:20:26.807 --> 04:20:29.986
TRAVIS: We will ourselves right
near that fucking door, though.

6662
04:20:29.986 --> 04:20:32.253
MATT: All right, you guys all drift by the door.

6663
04:20:32.253 --> 04:20:34.328
LIAM: Will you hold onto me, please?

6664
04:20:34.328 --> 04:20:35.161
SAM: Yes.

6665
04:20:35.161 --> 04:20:37.110
LAURA: Hold him, Beau.

6666
04:20:37.110 --> 04:20:39.966
LIAM: Okay, so...
MARISHA: You and your dumb cat.

6667
04:20:41.225 --> 04:20:43.454
LIAM: Blind and deaf and Frumpkin is just floating

6668
04:20:43.454 --> 04:20:46.430
in the astral sea in front of this thing's closed mouth.

6669
04:20:46.430 --> 04:20:47.263
MATT: Okay.

6670
04:20:48.588 --> 04:20:50.836
LAURA: Do you guys remember which one is the lever to let go

6671
04:20:50.836 --> 04:20:53.474
and which one opens the mouth?
LIAM: The one on the right is the one--

6672
04:20:53.474 --> 04:20:54.760
TRAVIS: You're blind and deaf.

6673
04:20:54.760 --> 04:20:56.686
LIAM: No, I'm not listening to anything,

6674
04:20:56.686 --> 04:20:58.747
I'm just talking out loud.

6675
04:20:58.747 --> 04:21:00.461
I don't like being blind and deaf,

6676
04:21:00.461 --> 04:21:01.957
so please do something soon.

6677
04:21:01.957 --> 04:21:05.854
SAM: Fjord, pull the right lever.
TRAVIS: I will myself up to the right lever.

6678
04:21:05.854 --> 04:21:08.339
(laughs) Chickow!

6679
04:21:08.339 --> 04:21:10.366
(laughter)

6680
04:21:10.366 --> 04:21:14.978
MATT: You pull the lever, and you hear (whirring),

6681
04:21:14.978 --> 04:21:16.800
and you just beyond, out of the sight

6682
04:21:16.800 --> 04:21:19.520
of the top of the island, something sparks,

6683
04:21:19.520 --> 04:21:22.435
and the sparks send down to the two chains,

6684
04:21:22.435 --> 04:21:25.534
and then arc over to the side of the creature's mouth,

6685
04:21:25.534 --> 04:21:27.814
shocking the sides of its body--

6686
04:21:27.814 --> 04:21:30.084
sides of its head. You watch it

6687
04:21:30.084 --> 04:21:31.611
pull and restrain against the chains,

6688
04:21:31.611 --> 04:21:34.378
and as it does, the jaw (sighs)

6689
04:21:34.378 --> 04:21:37.963
opens up, the teeth lining it, bit of spittle

6690
04:21:37.963 --> 04:21:39.723
spattering out, and as it's open,

6691
04:21:39.723 --> 04:21:42.527
you just see the dark interior of its throat.

6692
04:21:42.527 --> 04:21:44.220
LAURA: The poor baby!

6693
04:21:44.220 --> 04:21:46.465
MATT: Little tiny Frumpkin floating in space before it,

6694
04:21:46.465 --> 04:21:48.607
looking back at and Caleb going, (mews).

6695
04:21:48.607 --> 04:21:50.255
(laughter)

6696
04:21:50.255 --> 04:21:54.719
TRAVIS: Send that fucking cosmonaut
into that goddamn dreadnought.

6697
04:21:54.719 --> 04:21:58.957
LIAM: He just starts paddling
through the astral plane inside.

6698
04:21:58.957 --> 04:22:03.313
MATT: As Frumpkin heads into the gargantuan maw

6699
04:22:03.313 --> 04:22:05.626
of this terrifying astral beast,

6700
04:22:05.626 --> 04:22:09.578
you see the cat disappear into the shadow

6701
04:22:09.578 --> 04:22:11.382
and then you lose contact with Frumpkin.

6702
04:22:11.382 --> 04:22:14.468
LAURA: (gasps) It is, it's another doorway, holy shit.

6703
04:22:14.468 --> 04:22:19.277
LIAM: This thing has another plane inside of it.

6704
04:22:21.119 --> 04:22:23.027
MARISHA: Well, if it does go to the circle chamber,

6705
04:22:23.027 --> 04:22:26.799
that actually shaves off a lot of time, you know?

6706
04:22:26.799 --> 04:22:28.732
SAM: But we don't know where it goes.

6707
04:22:32.097 --> 04:22:34.920
LIAM: It's not innards. It's not the inside of a beast.

6708
04:22:34.920 --> 04:22:36.656
MARISHA: Yeah, it's another door.

6709
04:22:36.656 --> 04:22:38.927
TRAVIS: We don't know. It's too much.

6710
04:22:38.927 --> 04:22:41.752
We're level 10. It's too much!

6711
04:22:42.660 --> 04:22:43.501
LAURA: Do it.

6712
04:22:43.501 --> 04:22:44.438
TRAVIS: Do you want to go in?

6713
04:22:44.438 --> 04:22:45.501
SAM: No!

6714
04:22:45.501 --> 04:22:46.630
Where would we go?

6715
04:22:46.630 --> 04:22:48.076
MARISHA: Okay, okay, fine.

6716
04:22:48.076 --> 04:22:49.956
Now I'm flipping, now I'm flipping.

6717
04:22:49.956 --> 04:22:53.641
TRAVIS: Counterclockwise, Caduceus, going in or leaving?

6718
04:22:53.641 --> 04:22:55.644
TALIESIN: I think going in.

6719
04:22:55.644 --> 04:22:57.020
TRAVIS: Laura, going in?
LAURA: Going in!

6720
04:22:57.020 --> 04:22:57.853
Sam, speak the truth.

6721
04:22:57.853 --> 04:22:58.844
SAM: No!

6722
04:22:58.844 --> 04:23:00.312
TRAVIS: Liam, speak the truth!

6723
04:23:00.312 --> 04:23:02.475
LIAM: Caleb starts floating towards the mouth.

6724
04:23:02.475 --> 04:23:04.867
(laughter)
MARISHA: No, no, I'm holding onto him.

6725
04:23:04.867 --> 04:23:06.291
TRAVIS: That's three and one, that's three and one.

6726
04:23:06.291 --> 04:23:09.074
MARISHA: I am holding onto him.

6727
04:23:09.074 --> 04:23:10.649
Yeah, okay, let's go.

6728
04:23:10.649 --> 04:23:11.482
MATT: (laughs)

6729
04:23:11.482 --> 04:23:12.957
SAM: What are we doing?!

6730
04:23:12.957 --> 04:23:14.765
(laughter)

6731
04:23:14.765 --> 04:23:16.312
LIAM: Nott the Brave.

6732
04:23:16.312 --> 04:23:19.531
Live up to your name.

6733
04:23:19.531 --> 04:23:21.797
MATT: And you all are doing this.

6734
04:23:21.797 --> 04:23:22.988
Okay, so--

6735
04:23:22.988 --> 04:23:24.600
(shouting)

6736
04:23:24.600 --> 04:23:28.075
MATT: Nott, you watch as the entirety your friend party,

6737
04:23:28.075 --> 04:23:32.225
one by one, drift into the open gaping

6738
04:23:32.225 --> 04:23:34.658
toothy jaws of an astral dreadnought.

6739
04:23:34.658 --> 04:23:35.503
MARISHA: We're still holding hands.

6740
04:23:35.503 --> 04:23:36.742
LAURA: We're holding hands.
TALIESIN: Holding hands.

6741
04:23:36.742 --> 04:23:39.728
MATT: Until they're all disappeared into the shadow--

6742
04:23:39.728 --> 04:23:40.715
MARISHA: Holding hands!

6743
04:23:40.715 --> 04:23:42.161
MATT: You're holding Nott's hand? You're going with them?

6744
04:23:42.161 --> 04:23:44.114
MARISHA: The rule before we came in here was--

6745
04:23:44.114 --> 04:23:45.495
TALIESIN: Everybody holds hands!

6746
04:23:45.495 --> 04:23:46.564
MARISHA: Everybody holds hands.

6747
04:23:46.564 --> 04:23:48.263
MATT: So Nott, you're being dragged into its mouth.

6748
04:23:48.263 --> 04:23:49.632
TRAVIS: Or you can stay out.

6749
04:23:49.632 --> 04:23:51.490
(laughter)

6750
04:23:51.490 --> 04:23:54.589
SAM: I've already died once. It's okay, let's go.

6751
04:23:54.589 --> 04:23:56.672
(laughter)

6752
04:23:56.672 --> 04:24:00.783
MATT: One by one, you feel yourself going into its

6753
04:24:00.783 --> 04:24:03.432
warm, cavernous throat.

6754
04:24:03.432 --> 04:24:07.103
The smell itself is strange. It's peppery,

6755
04:24:07.103 --> 04:24:09.013
but also metallic.

6756
04:24:09.013 --> 04:24:10.484
It's nondescript.

6757
04:24:10.484 --> 04:24:11.965
TALIESIN: Thank you.

6758
04:24:13.015 --> 04:24:14.930
MATT: Just at that moment that you look behind

6759
04:24:14.930 --> 04:24:16.691
and you can see the silhouetted shadow

6760
04:24:16.691 --> 04:24:21.324
of the dozens of teeth and the jaw closes.

6761
04:24:21.324 --> 04:24:22.638
SAM: No!

6762
04:24:22.638 --> 04:24:26.479
MATT: You feel your body suddenly get drawn (whooshes)

6763
04:24:26.479 --> 04:24:29.262
quickly down a space similar to stepping through

6764
04:24:29.262 --> 04:24:30.981
these doorways before--

6765
04:24:30.981 --> 04:24:31.996
LIAM: To the taint!

6766
04:24:31.996 --> 04:24:33.092
MATT: You stop.

6767
04:24:33.092 --> 04:24:34.372
MARISHA: Where is-- where is it?

6768
04:24:34.372 --> 04:24:38.874
MATT: Standing in a cavernous, dark chamber.

6769
04:24:38.874 --> 04:24:40.856
You have no idea where the walls are.

6770
04:24:40.856 --> 04:24:43.285
It is too open with what little bit of light you have.

6771
04:24:43.285 --> 04:24:45.311
MARISHA: I look down, what's on the floor?

6772
04:24:45.311 --> 04:24:48.765
MATT: Stone. Your gravity has taken you now.

6773
04:24:48.765 --> 04:24:51.856
LIAM: I'm taking my hands back. We're standing with fire.

6774
04:24:51.856 --> 04:24:52.963
MATT: You light the space around you.

6775
04:24:52.963 --> 04:24:55.743
You can see distant sconces of burning torches

6776
04:24:55.743 --> 04:24:58.087
and candelabras set in the center.

6777
04:24:58.087 --> 04:24:59.757
MARISHA: Markings?

6778
04:24:59.757 --> 04:25:01.168
MATT: You don't see markings.

6779
04:25:01.168 --> 04:25:06.148
All you do see is a small arranged set of tables

6780
04:25:06.148 --> 04:25:09.991
in the middle of this wide open cavern.

6781
04:25:09.991 --> 04:25:11.441
And that's where we'll pick up next week.

6782
04:25:11.441 --> 04:25:14.099
(shouting)

6783
04:25:14.099 --> 04:25:15.918
SAM: Tables? What kind of tables?

6784
04:25:15.918 --> 04:25:17.304
LAURA: We're off the map!

6785
04:25:17.304 --> 04:25:18.586
MATT: You guys are off the map now.

6786
04:25:18.586 --> 04:25:22.245
(all shouting)

6787
04:25:22.245 --> 04:25:23.541
SAM: Why did we do this!

6788
04:25:23.541 --> 04:25:26.399
TRAVIS: I'm sick, I'm sick. My arm hurts.

6789
04:25:26.399 --> 04:25:27.808
TALIESIN: This is all your doing.

6790
04:25:27.808 --> 04:25:29.723
TRAVIS: This might be a heart attack.

6791
04:25:29.723 --> 04:25:32.173
(laughter)

6792
04:25:32.173 --> 04:25:35.597
TALIESIN: No, I'm into it. I'm really into it.

6793
04:25:35.597 --> 04:25:37.558
MATT: The one thing you do note.
LAURA: Oh?

6794
04:25:37.558 --> 04:25:39.559
MATT: There is no doorway behind you.

6795
04:25:39.559 --> 04:25:41.646
SAM: Oh my god.

6796
04:25:41.646 --> 04:25:42.753
MARISHA: What have we done?

6797
04:25:42.753 --> 04:25:44.517
(laughter)

6798
04:25:44.517 --> 04:25:46.209
MATT: You don't-- there's not enough light to see

6799
04:25:46.209 --> 04:25:47.823
the perimeters of this chamber.

6800
04:25:47.823 --> 04:25:50.545
It's just this open space with a little bit of firelight.

6801
04:25:50.545 --> 04:25:52.761
TALIESIN: It was an educated guess.

6802
04:25:52.761 --> 04:25:54.587
MATT: But we're going to pick up there next week,

6803
04:25:54.587 --> 04:25:57.633
which will be our Halloween episode, how interesting.

6804
04:25:57.633 --> 04:25:58.488
That'll be fun.

6805
04:25:58.488 --> 04:26:00.819
LIAM: Matt, right now, Caleb turns and looks at the audience

6806
04:26:00.819 --> 04:26:03.217
like that little girl in front of the burning house.

6807
04:26:03.217 --> 04:26:07.145
(laughter)

6808
04:26:07.145 --> 04:26:08.547
SAM: Oh my god.

6809
04:26:08.547 --> 04:26:10.400
TALIESIN: We're off the map!

6810
04:26:10.400 --> 04:26:12.448
MATT: Okay, we'll see where this goes next week.

6811
04:26:12.448 --> 04:26:13.932
SAM: Do you know where this goes?!

6812
04:26:13.932 --> 04:26:14.822
MATT: Oh, I know.

6813
04:26:14.822 --> 04:26:16.230
Well, I know elements.

6814
04:26:16.230 --> 04:26:19.259
I know what's in this chamber.
MARISHA: I love how conflicted everyone is.

6815
04:26:19.259 --> 04:26:20.715
Internally and externally.

6816
04:26:20.715 --> 04:26:21.548
MATT: I know.

6817
04:26:21.548 --> 04:26:22.832
Peak D&amp;D, I love it.

6818
04:26:22.832 --> 04:26:24.774
All right guys.
TRAVIS: I just wanted to look over the cliff.

6819
04:26:24.774 --> 04:26:27.356
I didn't think we were going to
take our clothes off and jump.

6820
04:26:27.356 --> 04:26:28.369
(laughter)

6821
04:26:28.369 --> 04:26:29.536
TALIESIN: Have you met us?

6822
04:26:29.536 --> 04:26:31.107
MATT: I was genuinely a little surprised.

6823
04:26:31.107 --> 04:26:32.765
I thought you guys were going to go the other way.

6824
04:26:32.765 --> 04:26:34.861
SAM: Of course you should've gone the other way.

6825
04:26:34.861 --> 04:26:36.165
MATT: But hey, here you are.

6826
04:26:36.165 --> 04:26:37.858
We'll see where it takes us.

6827
04:26:37.858 --> 04:26:39.580
All right guys.
MARISHA: We never learn!

6828
04:26:39.580 --> 04:26:40.996
(laughter)

6829
04:26:40.996 --> 04:26:42.355
MARISHA: Why do we keep doing this!

6830
04:26:42.355 --> 04:26:44.060
MATT: We will--
TALIESIN: That will be our tombstone.

6831
04:26:44.060 --> 04:26:45.234
"We have never learned."

6832
04:26:45.234 --> 04:26:46.542
MATT: I know.

6833
04:26:46.542 --> 04:26:48.893
Thank you for joining us for tonight's adventure.

6834
04:26:48.893 --> 04:26:50.196
We'll pick this up next week.

6835
04:26:50.196 --> 04:26:52.889
We love you very much, and is it Thursday yet?

6836
04:26:52.889 --> 04:26:54.203
Good night.
SAM: Oh my god.

6837
04:26:54.203 --> 04:26:58.828
(dramatic music)

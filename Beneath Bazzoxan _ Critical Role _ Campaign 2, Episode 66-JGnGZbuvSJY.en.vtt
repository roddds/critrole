00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.833
MATT: Hello, everyone,

2
00:00:00.833 --> 00:00:02.330
and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role,

3
00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:03.540
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

4
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.413
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

5
00:00:05.413 --> 00:00:08.246
(yelling)

6
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.473
Before we get into our game tonight,

7
00:00:12.473 --> 00:00:13.740
we do have a few announcements to get through,

8
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.060
beginning with our fantastic friend

9
00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.670
and sponsor to the show for all of campaign two--

10
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.156
SAM: That's crazy.
MATT: D&amp;D Beyond.

11
00:00:21.156 --> 00:00:22.840
Sam, if you don't mind.

12
00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.456
SAM: D&amp;D Beyond!

13
00:00:24.456 --> 00:00:26.480
Big news from D&amp;D Beyond.

14
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.800
Their brand new Encounter Builder Alpha

15
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.807
is now available to all D&amp;D Beyond subscribers.

16
00:00:31.807 --> 00:00:34.788
I actually legitimately checked it out earlier today,

17
00:00:34.788 --> 00:00:37.290
and it is legit really addictive.

18
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.170
There's hundreds of monsters and filters to pore through.

19
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.011
It's a super handy tool to craft unique

20
00:00:42.011 --> 00:00:44.960
and flavorful fights

21
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.064
that fit your current setting and difficulty level.

22
00:00:48.064 --> 00:00:51.760
To celebrate this awesome new tool,

23
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.450
I've written a genius-level spoof rap song

24
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.430
that I like to call "You Down With D&amp;D?

25
00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:58.700
"Yeah, You Know Me."

26
00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:59.950
SAM: Okay, guys.

27
00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.759
Drop that beat--
LIAM: Wait, wait.

28
00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:03.401
SAM: What?
LIAM: Stop, no.

29
00:01:03.401 --> 00:01:04.580
Stop!
SAM: What?

30
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.450
LIAM: I have something to say.
SAM: What?

31
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.450
LIAM: Last week you and Marisha

32
00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.010
dumped your bombshell report.

33
00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.982
Scandalous accusations about me

34
00:01:13.982 --> 00:01:16.740
accepting illegal campaign donations

35
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.270
from a foreign agent, Mark Hulmes,

36
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.470
from the evil, British D&amp;D show, High Rollers.

37
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.040
SAM: Yeah, but these were not accusations, Liam.

38
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.110
These were facts, hard facts

39
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.314
that have doomed your pathetic campaign,

40
00:01:28.314 --> 00:01:30.608
so let's just move on to my rap.

41
00:01:30.608 --> 00:01:31.441
♪ Yeah ♪

42
00:01:31.441 --> 00:01:33.536
LIAM: Not so fast, Riegel!

43
00:01:33.536 --> 00:01:36.017
I haven't responded to your little inquiry yet,

44
00:01:36.017 --> 00:01:38.320
and I think I know why you don't want me to,

45
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.804
because this week I uncovered new facts

46
00:01:41.804 --> 00:01:43.916
that will completely exonerate me

47
00:01:43.916 --> 00:01:45.716
and my adorable running mate.

48
00:01:45.716 --> 00:01:46.978
SAM: Exonerate?

49
00:01:46.978 --> 00:01:48.890
Please, go ahead.

50
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.850
Do your whatever you're going to do.

51
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:51.693
Go!

52
00:01:51.693 --> 00:01:53.770
LIAM: (chuckles) You may have hoodwinked

53
00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.081
this one onto your side,

54
00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:58.407
but I too have a secret weapon,

55
00:01:58.407 --> 00:02:01.210
a person who, on the surface at least,

56
00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.504
might seem like an overgrown dullard,

57
00:02:03.504 --> 00:02:07.948
a muscular nincompoop, a big old dumb dumb.

58
00:02:07.948 --> 00:02:09.930
(laughter)

59
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:10.763
Yes, that's right.

60
00:02:10.763 --> 00:02:12.590
I'm talking about Travis Willingham.

61
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.103
Yes, he's a jock.

62
00:02:14.103 --> 00:02:15.930
Yes, he works out too much.

63
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:16.763
Is that right?

64
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.530
Yes, he's fascinated by small, shiny objects,

65
00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.121
but he's also a brilliant forensics analyst

66
00:02:24.121 --> 00:02:26.400
with multiple PhDs and degrees

67
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.567
from international universities.

68
00:02:28.567 --> 00:02:30.650
Dr. Willingham!

69
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.666
TRAVIS: Thank you, Mr. O'Brien.

70
00:02:33.666 --> 00:02:35.800
When subjected to rigorous scientific analysis,

71
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.885
the evidence Sam presented last week was

72
00:02:37.885 --> 00:02:40.390
(sighs) flimsy at best.

73
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.940
For instance, that photograph of Mr. O'Brien

74
00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.412
holding some British money? Easily Photoshopped.

75
00:02:46.412 --> 00:02:49.130
And the audio recording Mr. O'Brien on the phone

76
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.386
with a supposed British accent,

77
00:02:51.386 --> 00:02:54.280
or an agent rather? Well, we all know

78
00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.820
that Sam himself does an excellent Liam O'Brien impression.

79
00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.870
Sam?
SAM: I mean, sure.

80
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.380
(like Liam) Hi, I'm Liam O'Brien.

81
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.830
My voice sounds like sad sandpaper,

82
00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.160
(like Sam) But that doesn't prove anything.

83
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.670
That's just something I do for laughs, for yuks.

84
00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:09.503
That's nothing!

85
00:03:09.503 --> 00:03:13.352
I have legitimate proof of your client

86
00:03:13.352 --> 00:03:16.780
on-camera doing a deal with Mark Hulmes.

87
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.480
That is irrefutable!

88
00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.088
TRAVIS: Is it? Is it?

89
00:03:21.088 --> 00:03:23.580
I brought that video to my lab.

90
00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.413
SAM: Lab?

91
00:03:24.413 --> 00:03:25.813
TRAVIS: I loaded it, yes,

92
00:03:25.813 --> 00:03:28.346
into a level nine, microflux video meter

93
00:03:28.346 --> 00:03:30.630
and scrubbed the footage using a military-grade,

94
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.470
series seven vector graphic discombobulator.

95
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.800
SAM: Series seven?
LAURA: Yeah, he just got it.

96
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.350
TRAVIS: I broke out the big fucking guns.

97
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.041
You heard me, Riegel.

98
00:03:39.041 --> 00:03:42.210
After hours of rendering, de-rendering,

99
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.640
and painstaking decryption, I cracked it.

100
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.060
The footage had been altered.

101
00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.910
Roll the actual footage of that meeting.

102
00:03:52.792 --> 00:03:57.368
MARK: Well, after you win the D&amp;D Beyond election,

103
00:03:57.368 --> 00:03:59.297
you remember your mission?

104
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:02.830
SAM: I know what I have to do.

105
00:04:03.857 --> 00:04:07.030
Convert the D&amp;D Beyond app to the British system

106
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.590
of weights and measurements.

107
00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.430
But won't that be confusing?

108
00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.090
I mean, nobody knows what a stone is, or

109
00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.916
how much it weighs.
MARK: Don't question me, O'Brien.

110
00:04:19.916 --> 00:04:22.047
COMPUTER (VO): Initializing facial recognition scan.

111
00:04:22.047 --> 00:04:27.046
Subject identified, Sam Riegel, age unknown.

112
00:04:27.046 --> 00:04:29.357
Mouth size anomaly detected.

113
00:04:29.357 --> 00:04:31.285
Warning, warning, warning.

114
00:04:31.285 --> 00:04:33.800
SAM: I mean, (stutters) that's...

115
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.931
Okay, how about this.

116
00:04:34.931 --> 00:04:39.500
If that footage was so easily altered, Dr. Willingham,

117
00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.899
what's to say that you didn't alter it, huh?

118
00:04:41.899 --> 00:04:44.310
How can you prove that you didn't alter the footage?

119
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.861
LIAM: Oh, there is more, Riegel.

120
00:04:45.861 --> 00:04:48.334
While Travis did his analysis,

121
00:04:48.334 --> 00:04:51.420
I hacked into your laptop.
SAM: No, you can't.

122
00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:52.710
That's impossible!
LIAM: Oh, really?

123
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.320
SAM: My password is impossible to crack.

124
00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.153
LIAM: Yeah?

125
00:04:55.153 --> 00:04:55.986
Uncrackable?

126
00:04:55.986 --> 00:04:57.420
You mean the password "$am is awe$ome,"

127
00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.270
with dollar signs for all the S's?

128
00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.721
I figured it out in two minutes!

129
00:05:00.721 --> 00:05:01.810
(laughs)
SAM: No.

130
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:02.889
No!

131
00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:05.600
No, no, no!
LIAM: Right there

132
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.074
on your messy, skanky desktop I found it,

133
00:05:09.074 --> 00:05:14.074
the unused footage from that same Mark Hulmes video.

134
00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:15.123
Roll it!

135
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.020
SAM: Yes, sir.

136
00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.853
Good bye.

137
00:05:18.853 --> 00:05:22.186
MARK: Uh, uh, uh. I think you mean--

138
00:05:22.186 --> 00:05:24.552
SAM: Right, sorry.

139
00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.222
Pip pip cheerio.

140
00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:39.590
You clear, Mark?

141
00:05:40.667 --> 00:05:43.910
Marisha, did you get it all? (laughs)

142
00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.320
Yes, yes!

143
00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.260
Okay remember, don't tell a soul.

144
00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.093
Nobody!

145
00:05:49.093 --> 00:05:51.379
Not even fucking Max, all right?

146
00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:53.654
This is going to change everything.

147
00:05:53.654 --> 00:05:55.240
Everything!

148
00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.073
Yes!

149
00:05:59.375 --> 00:06:00.990
(laughs evilly)

150
00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.050
No, no!

151
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.883
I didn't!

152
00:06:03.883 --> 00:06:05.980
You weren't supposed to...

153
00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:06.813
No!

154
00:06:06.813 --> 00:06:09.042
I've never lost anything in my life.

155
00:06:09.042 --> 00:06:11.387
I can't be here right now!

156
00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.445
LIAM: Thank you, Dr. Willingham.

157
00:06:15.445 --> 00:06:18.653
TRAVIS: My pleasure, Mr. President.

158
00:06:20.713 --> 00:06:24.682
LIAM: Ladies and gentlemen, Ms. Johnson,

159
00:06:24.682 --> 00:06:26.745
I rest my case.

160
00:06:26.745 --> 00:06:31.340
Sometimes it makes me wonder why I even bring the thunder.

161
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.093
MATT: Why he even brings the thunder.

162
00:06:34.093 --> 00:06:36.969
ASHLEY: Yes, I wonder also.

163
00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:41.940
MATT: Okay, thank you, everyone,

164
00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.231
and our friends at D&amp;D Beyond.

165
00:06:45.231 --> 00:06:47.100
TALIESIN and LAURA: D&amp;D Beyond!

166
00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.060
MATT: Fantastic.

167
00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:52.598
12-step for 5th Edition edition dragons. (laughs)

168
00:06:54.164 --> 00:06:55.620
MARISHA: I plead the fifth

169
00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:00.232
till further investigation is had.

170
00:07:00.232 --> 00:07:01.932
Oh, not the map.

171
00:07:01.932 --> 00:07:03.940
ASHLEY: Oh, wait. When is Sam going to come back?

172
00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:04.930
LIAM: He's off the show now.

173
00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:05.763
ASHLEY: He's off the show now

174
00:07:05.763 --> 00:07:07.460
because he didn't win to be president?

175
00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.293
LAURA: That's a bummer.

176
00:07:08.293 --> 00:07:11.177
ASHLEY: Well, when you're in a jam, just call DW.

177
00:07:11.177 --> 00:07:13.353
LAURA: Hmm!

178
00:07:13.353 --> 00:07:15.240
TRAVIS: DW?

179
00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.538
ASHLEY: Dr. Willingham.
TRAVIS: Yep.

180
00:07:17.538 --> 00:07:20.100
MARISHA: Dr. Who. Dr. Willingham.

181
00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:22.370
TRAVIS: Most doctors only have MD after their name.

182
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:25.002
I'm also DW.

183
00:07:25.002 --> 00:07:27.590
ASHLEY: Travis Willingham, DW MD.
TRAVIS: Down to work.

184
00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:29.888
LIAM: MD DW.
TRAVIS: For you.

185
00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:34.070
MATT: So our other announcements for the night. (laughs)

186
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:36.645
LIAM: Thanks, Dr. Dissmore.

187
00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:40.040
LAURA: Is he ever coming back?
LIAM: No.

188
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.050
MATT: No.
ASHLEY: That sucks.

189
00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:43.608
LAURA: So sad! He left his phone.

190
00:07:43.608 --> 00:07:44.657
MATT: Did he?

191
00:07:44.657 --> 00:07:45.940
TALIESIN: Thank you.

192
00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:47.481
MARISHA: It is open, too.

193
00:07:47.481 --> 00:07:49.623
MATT: Good call.
MARISHA: Oh, no!

194
00:07:49.623 --> 00:07:51.900
MATT: The VOD for our last episode of "Between the Sheets,"

195
00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:53.510
which aired this past Monday

196
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:55.333
with our fantastic Ashley Johnson

197
00:07:55.333 --> 00:07:56.650
(cheering)

198
00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:58.875
is available on our YouTube channel at

199
00:07:58.875 --> 00:08:01.970
YouTube.com/CriticalRole,

200
00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:03.960
and we'll be back with "Between the Sheets"

201
00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:07.263
in August with our next guest, Amanda Palmer.

202
00:08:07.263 --> 00:08:09.930
(cheering)

203
00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:11.210
So keep an eye out for that.

204
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:12.043
She's awesome.

205
00:08:12.043 --> 00:08:14.988
It's going to be a tear jerker.

206
00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:17.550
Also, thank you so much for all the Critters

207
00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:19.730
who came out to join us at Denver Pop Culture Con

208
00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:22.440
this weekend previous.

209
00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.677
It was amazing.

210
00:08:23.677 --> 00:08:25.260
It was so great to meet all of you.

211
00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:27.280
Critter turnout was incredible,

212
00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.730
the costumes were incredible.

213
00:08:29.682 --> 00:08:30.515
It was amazing.

214
00:08:30.515 --> 00:08:31.348
We took over.

215
00:08:31.348 --> 00:08:33.170
I got to drag these assholes

216
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:35.410
to Casa Bonita without context in advance.

217
00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:36.880
That was fun.

218
00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.610
LAURA: Ah, I should've worn my shirt.

219
00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:40.469
MATT: You should've. Next time.
LAURA: Damn it!

220
00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:41.495
TALIESIN: Nice.

221
00:08:41.495 --> 00:08:43.290
MATT: But yeah, thank you all for coming out.

222
00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:46.216
We had a great time. Hope you did, too.

223
00:08:46.216 --> 00:08:48.510
Laura, you have some announcements?

224
00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:51.160
LAURA: Uh-huh. I do.

225
00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.250
Oh my god, I do!

226
00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:53.419
This is not my stuff.

227
00:08:53.419 --> 00:08:55.230
I don't know where it is, but we do.

228
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.940
Yay, thank you.

229
00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.710
Hey, you guys!

230
00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:01.630
We got new shirts in our store.

231
00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:02.920
I know that, but I just wanted

232
00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.310
to make sure I say it right.

233
00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:07.690
We've got Baby Got Backstories.

234
00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:08.773
ASHLEY: Yeah!

235
00:09:08.773 --> 00:09:09.890
LAURA: Speaking of "Between The Sheets,"

236
00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:11.420
it's totally great.

237
00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:13.303
Then we've also got our

238
00:09:13.303 --> 00:09:15.561
Don't Forget to Love Each Other Pride shirt

239
00:09:15.561 --> 00:09:19.260
that is just the most beautiful thing ever,

240
00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:22.180
and we're so, so happy to have it in the store.

241
00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:23.920
For the entire month of June,

242
00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:25.600
100% of the profits will be going

243
00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.690
to OutRight International,

244
00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:29.610
which is a fantastic organization,

245
00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:30.977
and you guys should look it up.

246
00:09:30.977 --> 00:09:34.850
LIAM: Happy Pride Month, everyone.
MARISHA: Happy Pride!

247
00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:36.582
MATT: Thank you so much, Laura.

248
00:09:36.582 --> 00:09:38.310
And lest I'm mistaken--

249
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:39.143
LAURA: Oh, and I should let you know,

250
00:09:39.143 --> 00:09:40.420
it's all pre-order, so both shirts

251
00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:42.050
are going to ship within the next few weeks,

252
00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:45.020
just so you guys know.
MATT: There you go.

253
00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:49.350
On that note, I think we're good on announcements.

254
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:50.260
Let's go ahead and dive in

255
00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.693
to tonight's episode of Critical Role.

256
00:09:56.822 --> 00:09:58.872

MATT: Welcome back.

286
00:11:33.373 --> 00:11:36.949
So last we left off, The Mighty Nein,

287
00:11:36.949 --> 00:11:39.311
after making their alliances in Rosohna

288
00:11:39.311 --> 00:11:41.611
and the Dynasty of Xhorhas.

289
00:11:41.611 --> 00:11:44.200
You have been seeking an individual

290
00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.555
you believe is connected

291
00:11:45.555 --> 00:11:48.090
to the placing of these various abyssal anchors

292
00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:50.480
that have been tearing open portals

293
00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.840
between the Prime Material Plane and the Abyss.

294
00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.250
You've encountered it a few times

295
00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:57.490
since you've crossed over the Ashkeeper Peaks,

296
00:11:57.490 --> 00:11:59.916
or I should say, under,

297
00:11:59.916 --> 00:12:02.494
and you've been able to scry

298
00:12:02.494 --> 00:12:04.605
and put together a couple of individuals

299
00:12:04.605 --> 00:12:07.112
that are involved with this endeavor.

300
00:12:07.112 --> 00:12:08.740
You nearly got them in Rosohna,

301
00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:11.680
and then they escaped and made their way north,

302
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.120
where you've been chasing them off and on,

303
00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.545
pretty much all on,

304
00:12:15.545 --> 00:12:17.730
through the Barbed Fields, not around it,

305
00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:20.270
but right through the Barbed Fields,

306
00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:22.200
where you've encountered strange oddities

307
00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.970
and dangerous creatures and gloomstalkers,

308
00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:28.109
and eventually a mysterious,

309
00:12:28.109 --> 00:12:31.130
majestic, divine tree that sits

310
00:12:31.130 --> 00:12:32.686
in the center of this barren,

311
00:12:32.686 --> 00:12:34.660
destroyed, desolate wasteland

312
00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:36.848
where the final battles of the Calamity took place.

313
00:12:36.848 --> 00:12:41.848
You slept beneath this tree for protection.

314
00:12:42.039 --> 00:12:47.039
You climbed it, some of you in very unique ways,

315
00:12:47.464 --> 00:12:49.819
and stumbled upon a giant nest

316
00:12:49.819 --> 00:12:52.040
of some sort of a creature

317
00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:55.167
that you later on came to understand to be a roc,

318
00:12:55.167 --> 00:12:59.210
a massive bird that was asleep, until it was...

319
00:13:00.551 --> 00:13:02.915
rustled from its slumber.

320
00:13:02.915 --> 00:13:05.680
In hopes of escaping, a number of you,

321
00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:09.760
I believe is was Fjord, Jester,

322
00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:13.900
Nott, and Beau, had all leapt from...

323
00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:17.190
Or is Nott still being held by you?

324
00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:20.430
SAM: No, Nott and the other humanoids had jumped

325
00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:22.020
and we were Feather Falling.
MATT: Correct.

326
00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:23.800
LAURA: That's right, we were mid-fall.

327
00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.075
MATT: Right. You're still eagle?

328
00:13:25.075 --> 00:13:25.908
LIAM: Yeah.

329
00:13:25.908 --> 00:13:27.770
MATT: Yep, so you're still a flying, giant eagle.

330
00:13:27.770 --> 00:13:29.750
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: Cruising down,

331
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:31.380
while the other four of you had plummeted

332
00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:34.840
down about 150 or so feet before Feather Fall kicked in,

333
00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.360
and now you're all gently floating to the floor,

334
00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.560
as tearing out of the canopy

335
00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:43.451
of this massive tree is the screeching,

336
00:13:43.451 --> 00:13:47.998
hunting, rustled-awake roc.

337
00:13:47.998 --> 00:13:50.547
And that's where we left off.
TRAVIS: Fuck.

338
00:13:50.547 --> 00:13:52.116
Fuck me!

339
00:13:52.116 --> 00:13:54.140
MATT: As the four of you are are closing down,

340
00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:55.730
the two of you who are down at the bottom waiting

341
00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:59.733
at the base of the tree can hear the loud (screeches)

342
00:13:59.733 --> 00:14:01.750
screech come out across the sky above.

343
00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:03.499
You look up and see the shadow of the bird

344
00:14:03.499 --> 00:14:05.580
(whooshing) emerge from above.

345
00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:08.080
ASHLEY: Hey.
TALIESIN: Oh, boy.

346
00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:11.551
TRAVIS: We were just leaving.

347
00:14:11.551 --> 00:14:12.723
TALIESIN: Yeah.

348
00:14:12.723 --> 00:14:14.131
ASHLEY: Are they coming down?

349
00:14:14.131 --> 00:14:15.887
TALIESIN: I mean, kind of.

350
00:14:15.887 --> 00:14:17.498
TRAVIS: That music's not good.

351
00:14:17.498 --> 00:14:18.639
ASHLEY: Should we try and catch them?

352
00:14:18.639 --> 00:14:19.963
TALIESIN: I guess.

353
00:14:19.963 --> 00:14:22.597
MATT: So while this is happening,

354
00:14:22.597 --> 00:14:25.298
the four of you are all floating

355
00:14:25.298 --> 00:14:29.250
gradually five feet, ten feet, 15 feet.

356
00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:31.040
You're definitely going to be safe if you land,

357
00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:32.940
but it's going to be a little bit before you land.

358
00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:33.773
What are you doing?

359
00:14:33.773 --> 00:14:36.890
LAURA: I cast Disguise Self.

360
00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:41.710
I'm going to make myself look as much like a leaf as I can.

361
00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:42.700
SAM: A leaf?
LAURA: Yeah.

362
00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:43.533
SAM: Okay.

363
00:14:43.533 --> 00:14:44.660
LAURA: But I know it can only be a person

364
00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:45.690
that you disguise yourself as,

365
00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:48.351
so I'm like, I'm a big leaf.

366
00:14:48.351 --> 00:14:50.448
MATT: You're a person wearing a leaf costume.

367
00:14:50.448 --> 00:14:52.580
LAURA: Yes, basically.

368
00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:55.262
Just kind of floating.
LIAM: Like a third grade play.

369
00:14:55.262 --> 00:14:57.198
LAURA: A really shitty leaf costume.

370
00:14:57.198 --> 00:14:58.974
TRAVIS: Oh my god.
MATT: Perfect, okay.

371
00:14:58.974 --> 00:15:02.282
Jester goes into leaf mode. What are the rest of you doing?

372
00:15:02.282 --> 00:15:04.592
LIAM: (screeches)

373
00:15:05.839 --> 00:15:06.672
SAM: Oh, boy.

374
00:15:06.672 --> 00:15:08.840
MARISHA: How fast are we falling?

375
00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.882
MATT: Right now, you're falling...

376
00:15:10.882 --> 00:15:11.730
Let me look at what the specifics

377
00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:15.208
are of Feather Fall, but if I recall...

378
00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:18.460
Let me see here.

379
00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:22.050
SAM: It's 60 feet per round.
MATT: Correct.

380
00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:24.390
SAM: That's still pretty fast.
MATT: It's pretty fast.

381
00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:26.430
It's enough where six seconds, 60 feet,

382
00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:28.450
so it's ten feet a second.

383
00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:30.140
It's (whooshing).

384
00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:32.640
SAM: But you said we're still 250 feet up,

385
00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.230
so it's going to be--
MATT: About 150 feet up,

386
00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:35.740
so you got about three rounds before you land.

387
00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:36.810
MARISHA: Three rounds.

388
00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:37.940
MATT: This first round,

389
00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:40.651
you've turned yourself into a leaf costume.

390
00:15:40.651 --> 00:15:44.124
What are you guys doing?

391
00:15:44.124 --> 00:15:48.786
LAURA: My hat is a little stem.

392
00:15:48.786 --> 00:15:50.070
TRAVIS: I'm going to use Mask of Many Faces

393
00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:53.009
to make myself look like carved up already,

394
00:15:53.009 --> 00:15:58.009
and decaying, like decaying zombie Fjord,

395
00:15:58.260 --> 00:15:59.668
like rotting meat.

396
00:15:59.668 --> 00:16:03.035
MATT: A rotting balloon. Slowly drifting.

397
00:16:03.035 --> 00:16:04.410
TRAVIS: Like as unappetizing as possible.

398
00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:06.440
MATT: Sure, okay.

399
00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.900
You look like Taliesin as strawberry in your kids cartoon.

400
00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:09.733
TALIESIN: Thank you.

401
00:16:09.733 --> 00:16:11.650
That's where I was going with it.

402
00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:12.625
LAURA: Fjord,

403
00:16:12.625 --> 00:16:15.033
you should have made yourself look like a leaf!

404
00:16:15.033 --> 00:16:18.541
TRAVIS: No, you got that covered.

405
00:16:18.541 --> 00:16:20.150
MATT: (whooshing)

406
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:24.600
MARISHA: Can I swim back towards the tree?

407
00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.175
TRAVIS: Swim? (laughs)

408
00:16:27.175 --> 00:16:29.436
Do we know how physics work yet on this campaign?

409
00:16:29.436 --> 00:16:31.130
MARISHA: Oh, I'm trying!

410
00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:34.070
MATT: Okay, you attempt to flail midair.

411
00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:36.193
SAM: While holding a staff.
MATT: Yeah.

412
00:16:36.193 --> 00:16:37.847
MARISHA: It's on my back.
SAM: Okay, okay.

413
00:16:37.847 --> 00:16:39.750
MARISHA: I got strappies.

414
00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:42.000
LIAM: You have a deep relationship with free falling.

415
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.048
MARISHA: Yeah, I do.
MATT: You do.

416
00:16:43.048 --> 00:16:46.810
You feel you've gained a few inches towards the tree.

417
00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:48.240
There's a gulf of a few feet,

418
00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:49.890
so it'll take a while.

419
00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:51.207
Nott, what are you doing?

420
00:16:51.207 --> 00:16:54.704
SAM: Feather Fall, it's not a concentration spell.

421
00:16:54.704 --> 00:16:55.701
MATT: No, it's not.

422
00:16:55.701 --> 00:16:58.250
It lasts for a minute, I believe.

423
00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:00.440
SAM: It lasts until you land.
MATT: Oh.

424
00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:03.290
SAM: Basically.
MATT: Right, or how long?

425
00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:04.560
TRAVIS: Unless you get pinched back.

426
00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:06.459
SAM: That's it. It just says until they land.

427
00:17:06.459 --> 00:17:09.601
MATT: No, duration one minute. It's a minute or they land.

428
00:17:09.601 --> 00:17:13.870
SAM: I will cast Invisibility on myself as I fall.

429
00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:16.880
MATT: (whooshing) Nott vanishes into space.

430
00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.240
SAM: Sorry, guys.

431
00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:22.201
LAURA: Oh shit, I should have done that. (laughs)

432
00:17:22.201 --> 00:17:23.594
SAM: That was an option for you?

433
00:17:23.594 --> 00:17:26.100
TRAVIS: Are you fucking serious?

434
00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:29.790
SAM: You decided to be an even more bright, shiny target,

435
00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:31.929
something that birds like to eat.

436
00:17:31.929 --> 00:17:33.053
LAURA: Birds don't eat leaves!

437
00:17:33.053 --> 00:17:34.419
SAM: Sure they do.

438
00:17:34.419 --> 00:17:36.044
LAURA: Rocs don't eat leaves.

439
00:17:36.044 --> 00:17:36.885
MATT: You're a leaf on the wind.

440
00:17:36.885 --> 00:17:38.070
Nothing bad ever happens to somebody

441
00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:39.699
who's a leaf on the wind.

442
00:17:39.699 --> 00:17:40.532
TALIESIN: Too soon!

443
00:17:42.209 --> 00:17:46.618
LIAM: Just a Macy's Day balloon puller falling from the sky.

444
00:17:46.618 --> 00:17:48.800
MATT: Okay, so--

445
00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:50.472
TRAVIS: Please be going after the Wooly Mammoth.

446
00:17:50.472 --> 00:17:54.640
MATT: (whooshing) It turns around,

447
00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.512
and it's making it your way.

448
00:17:56.512 --> 00:17:58.282
It rolled pretty well on perception.

449
00:17:58.282 --> 00:17:59.814
TRAVIS: Which way?

450
00:17:59.814 --> 00:18:01.405
MATT: It's heading in your direction.

451
00:18:01.405 --> 00:18:03.609
TRAVIS: (screams)

452
00:18:03.609 --> 00:18:04.451
MATT: (screeches)

453
00:18:04.451 --> 00:18:05.609
LAURA: When it gets within 60 feet of me,

454
00:18:05.609 --> 00:18:07.476
I want to cast Command.

455
00:18:07.476 --> 00:18:08.397
MATT: Okay.

456
00:18:08.397 --> 00:18:11.630
It's right now about 200 feet away,

457
00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:14.220
but it's moving at 120 feet a round.

458
00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:15.996
SAM: Oh!

459
00:18:15.996 --> 00:18:17.690
MATT: (whooshing)

460
00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:18.837
Rocketing back towards the tree,

461
00:18:18.837 --> 00:18:21.390
you gauge at its rapid speed

462
00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:23.280
you're going to have a round before it gets

463
00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.180
to you and this goes off.

464
00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:26.500
So what are you casting Command for towards it?

465
00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:27.580
What are you getting it to do?

466
00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:30.209
LAURA: Flee.
MATT: To flee, okay.

467
00:18:30.209 --> 00:18:33.333
And the DC on that is?
LAURA: 17, wisdom.

468
00:18:33.333 --> 00:18:35.175
LIAM: Turn it around.

469
00:18:35.175 --> 00:18:38.425
MATT: Natural 17. Plus four, 21.

470
00:18:39.689 --> 00:18:41.920
(whooshing) Unaffected.

471
00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.040
It's rocketing towards you

472
00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:44.810
as you're all slowly floating down.

473
00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:46.280
Everyone else gets something to do on this round.

474
00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:47.855
TRAVIS: What height are we?

475
00:18:47.855 --> 00:18:49.498
How many feet off the ground-ish?

476
00:18:49.498 --> 00:18:51.050
MATT: At this point, the second round,

477
00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:53.040
you're about, I'd say, 80 feet up.

478
00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:55.270
About 80, 90 feet up.

479
00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:57.583
TRAVIS: Oh god.

480
00:18:57.583 --> 00:18:58.416
Goddamn it.

481
00:18:58.416 --> 00:18:59.721
Yep. (laughs)

482
00:18:59.721 --> 00:19:02.048
I had to use all my fucking spells.

483
00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:04.990
SAM: To climb the tree?
TRAVIS: Yep.

484
00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:09.513
I will hold my bonus action, Misty Step,

485
00:19:09.513 --> 00:19:13.080
from the falchion until the roc comes

486
00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:15.380
within grasping distance of me.

487
00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:17.683
MARISHA: How close am I away from Fjord?

488
00:19:17.683 --> 00:19:19.180
MATT: You guys all jumped together,

489
00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:20.410
so you're about five feet from him.

490
00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:22.090
MARISHA: I reach out and grab Fjord,

491
00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:24.440
and be like: Please don't fucking leave me here.

492
00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:27.352
TRAVIS: It's a one-way ticket.
MARISHA: Please, fuck!

493
00:19:27.352 --> 00:19:29.470
TRAVIS: I only got room for one on this one.

494
00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:30.303
MARISHA: You dick!

495
00:19:30.303 --> 00:19:31.540
TRAVIS: I'm sorry!

496
00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:33.080
MATT: Beau and Nott, you guys are remaining invisible

497
00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:34.780
and just holding on for dear life.

498
00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:38.467
MARISHA: Everyone's fucking bailing on me,

499
00:19:38.467 --> 00:19:40.025
and I ain't got shit!

500
00:19:40.025 --> 00:19:42.257
LAURA: I'm a leaf, I'm still with you.

501
00:19:42.257 --> 00:19:43.348
I'm still with you.

502
00:19:43.348 --> 00:19:46.150
LIAM: Caleb, hearing these two bicker with eagle ears,

503
00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:49.060
is going to fly within their reach

504
00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:51.493
and just try to stay close to them as they fall.

505
00:19:51.493 --> 00:19:52.420
MATT: Okay.

506
00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:54.340
You make your way close nearby

507
00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:55.780
to where this is happening.

508
00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:56.613
All right.

509
00:19:56.613 --> 00:19:57.950
SAM: I'll just ready my crossbow.

510
00:19:57.950 --> 00:19:59.050
That's it.

511
00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:01.970
MARISHA: I make myself tiny to hopefully be

512
00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:05.497
as small of a speck as possible.

513
00:20:05.497 --> 00:20:06.330
TRAVIS: Like a small cannonball.

514
00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:08.825
MATT: Okay, next round.

515
00:20:08.825 --> 00:20:11.263
(whooshing) It comes right towards you.

516
00:20:11.263 --> 00:20:12.579
TRAVIS: Oh god.

517
00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:14.691
MATT: Just for the hell of it,

518
00:20:14.691 --> 00:20:18.194
I want all of you to roll a stealth check for me.

519
00:20:18.194 --> 00:20:20.407
LAURA: (giggles)
MARISHA: Okay.

520
00:20:20.407 --> 00:20:22.440
SAM: Advantage, I assume, for me?
MATT: Advantage for you,

521
00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:25.720
disadvantage for Beau, and disadvantage for Fjord.

522
00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:28.753
TRAVIS: Disadvantage? Damn it. That would have been better.

523
00:20:28.753 --> 00:20:31.111
MARISHA: Okay, that's still not bad, though.

524
00:20:31.111 --> 00:20:33.072
24.
MATT: 24.

525
00:20:33.072 --> 00:20:34.617
Three.

526
00:20:34.617 --> 00:20:37.237
LAURA: Six.
SAM: Natural 20.

527
00:20:37.237 --> 00:20:39.094
MATT: Okay, ten.

528
00:20:39.094 --> 00:20:39.935
You're an eagle.

529
00:20:39.935 --> 00:20:42.650
You're not really being stealthy, unfortunately.

530
00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:44.090
You're just making loud noises and swooping by.

531
00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:45.540
LIAM: I have an intelligence of eight.

532
00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:47.020
I know what I am doing.

533
00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:50.384
MATT: Beau manages to scoot along

534
00:20:50.384 --> 00:20:51.830
one of the knots of the tree

535
00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:53.320
and kick off and push out

536
00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:55.040
of the way of its trajectory.

537
00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:58.540
It is coming straight towards Jester and Fjord.

538
00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:00.356
ASHLEY: No, no!
SAM: You're going to die.

539
00:21:00.356 --> 00:21:02.190
MATT: (whooshing)
LAURA: (laughs)

540
00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:04.800
MATT: It swoops in and actually slams

541
00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.601
into both of you and the tree,

542
00:21:07.601 --> 00:21:10.710
(crashing) splintering the side of its bark.

543
00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:14.450
Its beak snatches out towards you, Fjord.

544
00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:17.211
MARISHA: Oh my god.
TRAVIS: Can I do the Misty Step?

545
00:21:17.211 --> 00:21:18.552
MATT: You can.
TRAVIS: Okay.

546
00:21:18.552 --> 00:21:19.949
Do I need to?

547
00:21:19.949 --> 00:21:21.440
MATT: You did say you were holding it,

548
00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:22.940
so you do.

549
00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:27.310
That's a natural 20 that you managed to dodge out.

550
00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:29.200
TRAVIS: I'll shoot 30 feet straight down.

551
00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.390
MATT: Okay. (whooshing)

552
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:33.394
Which instead goes to Jester.
(gasps)

553
00:21:33.394 --> 00:21:36.060
TRAVIS: (groans) But what if he was aiming towards me

554
00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:37.930
and right at the last minute, I (whooshing).

555
00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:40.710
MATT: Right, but the talons go right toward her.

556
00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:42.810
It's a different attack roll
TRAVIS: Okay.

557
00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:45.960
MATT: This is going to be 17 to hit.

558
00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:47.990
LAURA: Oh, no, it misses!
MATT: You're lucky.

559
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:50.920
He rolled a four on that one.

560
00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:53.410
The talons reach out and try and grab

561
00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:55.500
for you as they're going toward the tree.

562
00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:56.820
You manage to just put out at him

563
00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:58.750
with your shield and dart off,

564
00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:01.180
drifting 15 feet radically to the left.

565
00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:03.500
Its claws (crashing) dig into the tree impacts,

566
00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:07.105
its wings beat once more as it pushes off again.

567
00:22:07.105 --> 00:22:08.570
(screeches) It's going to go ahead

568
00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:13.480
and go towards attempting to grab somebody the next round.

569
00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:15.691
MARISHA: If she gets pushed toward me,

570
00:22:15.691 --> 00:22:17.250
and if I'm by the tree,

571
00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:20.534
can I try and reach out and grab her and throw her?

572
00:22:20.534 --> 00:22:21.367
LAURA: Wait.

573
00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:23.600
MARISHA: No?
LAURA: Don't do it.

574
00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:24.433
MARISHA: Okay.

575
00:22:24.433 --> 00:22:26.130
MATT: You reach out and Jester goes.

576
00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:29.810
MARISHA: Oh, this is a trend.
LAURA: But I hold your hand.

577
00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:31.350
MARISHA: Okay.
LAURA: Don't throw me.

578
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:32.183
MARISHA: Okay.

579
00:22:32.183 --> 00:22:35.130
MATT: So you hold Jester's hand. That's your action?

580
00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:36.893
MARISHA: Yeah.

581
00:22:36.893 --> 00:22:37.940
I don't really have anything.

582
00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:38.937
I'm still trying to be stealthy.

583
00:22:38.937 --> 00:22:40.828
MATT: Fjord, anything? You're at the bottom now.

584
00:22:40.828 --> 00:22:42.280
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm lower.

585
00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.940
No, nothing yet.
MATT: This round you touch down.

586
00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:46.130
TRAVIS: Okay, I have?
MATT: Yeah.

587
00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:47.860
TRAVIS: I probably took some damage--

588
00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:49.400
MATT: Everyone's going to touch down after this one.

589
00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.998
TRAVIS: 40 feet I fell.
LAURA: I have a question.

590
00:22:51.998 --> 00:22:55.954
MATT: No, but you're still Feather Falling, so no damage.

591
00:22:55.954 --> 00:22:57.162
LAURA: It doesn't count as landing

592
00:22:57.162 --> 00:22:58.662
if we hit the tree, does it?

593
00:22:58.662 --> 00:23:00.114
MATT: No, bumping into it does not.

594
00:23:00.114 --> 00:23:01.270
For the purposes of this spell,

595
00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:03.080
it's landing onto a solid surface

596
00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:05.000
where there's no more fall momentum.

597
00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.720
LAURA: Okay.

598
00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:09.570
MATT: Nott, anything?

599
00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:11.484
SAM: I mean, it doesn't see me, so I'm okay.

600
00:23:11.484 --> 00:23:12.783
MATT: You're fine.

601
00:23:12.783 --> 00:23:14.870
TRAVIS: Because I'm 30 feet away,

602
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:18.700
can I use my Hexblade's Curse to just mark the thing.

603
00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:20.820
MATT: If you'd like to, yeah.
TRAVIS: I'll do it.

604
00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:21.653
MATT: All right.

605
00:23:21.653 --> 00:23:23.740
You mark the massive bird.

606
00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:25.559
And when I say massive, I mean...

607
00:23:25.559 --> 00:23:26.850
LAURA: Did you just burp? Was that you?

608
00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:28.791
TALIESIN: That was me.

609
00:23:28.791 --> 00:23:31.553
MATT: I'm saying about 200-foot wing span.

610
00:23:31.553 --> 00:23:34.569
TRAVIS: 200 feet?!

611
00:23:34.569 --> 00:23:35.402
MATT: Yeah.

612
00:23:35.402 --> 00:23:36.868
TALIESIN: Are we anywhere near that

613
00:23:36.868 --> 00:23:39.451
little alcove cave, by the way?

614
00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:41.870
MATT: You're not that far from it, yeah.

615
00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:43.486
TALIESIN: Okay, so we can move towards that

616
00:23:43.486 --> 00:23:44.561
while this is happening.

617
00:23:44.561 --> 00:23:46.700
TRAVIS: My god, there better be some fucking

618
00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:48.500
gopher holes in the ground.
MARISHA: Yeah.

619
00:23:50.047 --> 00:23:52.700
TALIESIN: There's an alcove.
LAURA: The one alcove.

620
00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:53.880
Will it fit all of us, that alcove?

621
00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:55.293
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: Well, you'll find out.

622
00:23:55.293 --> 00:23:56.426
LAURA: (screams)
Maybe.

623
00:23:56.426 --> 00:23:57.673
SAM: We've never fought a roc before.

624
00:23:57.673 --> 00:23:58.620
TRAVIS: You don't want to.

625
00:23:58.620 --> 00:23:59.710
SAM: We just fled.

626
00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:01.740
LAURA: We've always fled.

627
00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:03.007
MARISHA: I got bit by one.

628
00:24:03.007 --> 00:24:06.280
TALIESIN: I'm going to start heading in that direction.

629
00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:08.440
I'm also, just to try and distract it,

630
00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:12.270
I'm going to use Thaumaturgy to send a sound

631
00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:14.530
and a bit of movement as far as I can

632
00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:18.833
from us in the opposite direction into the tree line.

633
00:24:18.833 --> 00:24:22.086
Just a big, squawking predator of (screeches),

634
00:24:22.086 --> 00:24:24.930
whatever it needs to hear to maybe throw it

635
00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:26.660
off for a second, get some movement.

636
00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:28.360
MATT: Okay, I'll allow a deception check.

637
00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:30.943
TALIESIN: Okay, those go great.

638
00:24:32.414 --> 00:24:35.242
Oh, 17.
MATT: Okay.

639
00:24:35.242 --> 00:24:37.390
Doesn't seem to catch its attention, unfortunately.

640
00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:39.020
It was worth a shot.

641
00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:40.930
TALIESIN: It was a worth a shot.

642
00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:42.580
MATT: Yasha, anything you're doing or just?

643
00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:44.550
ASHLEY: We're just running to the--

644
00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:46.260
MATT: Trying to catch up where they are.

645
00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:48.055
All right. Fjord, you're on the bottom.

646
00:24:48.055 --> 00:24:49.930
Caleb, you're still in the eagle form.

647
00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:51.966
You're keeping near them.
MARISHA: One round out.

648
00:24:51.966 --> 00:24:54.190
LIAM: We're close to the ground, right?

649
00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:57.980
MATT: Yeah, after this round, everybody's hit the ground.

650
00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:00.230
LIAM: Do I have time to race toward the ground

651
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:02.520
and drop the spell, or are we past that point?

652
00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:03.480
MATT: With your speed, you could.

653
00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:04.900
LIAM: Yeah, so I'm just going to just,

654
00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:05.990
now that I see we're close,

655
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:08.560
I'm going to nosedive and then hit the ground

656
00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:11.123
and then roll as Caleb in a big pile.

657
00:25:11.123 --> 00:25:13.196
MATT: Catch yourself.

658
00:25:13.196 --> 00:25:16.852
TALIESIN: Guiding everyone to the hidey hole.

659
00:25:16.852 --> 00:25:19.143
MATT: Jester? Beau's holding your hand.

660
00:25:19.143 --> 00:25:20.090
What are you doing?

661
00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:23.130
LAURA: Oh, well, we're going to hit the ground anyway?

662
00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:24.440
MATT: You're just waiting to hit the ground?

663
00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:26.820
LAURA: Well, I was going to Dimension Door us,

664
00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:27.820
but if we're going to hit

665
00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:29.510
the ground anyway then it's pointless.

666
00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:31.270
SAM: Go to the alcove!

667
00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:33.400
You can go to the other side.

668
00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.141
LAURA: Okay, I'll do that.

669
00:25:35.141 --> 00:25:38.032
I Dimension Door as we're falling,

670
00:25:38.032 --> 00:25:39.300
the door like right behind us,

671
00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:41.390
and as we go through the door,

672
00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:42.750
I bamf us into the little alcove

673
00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:45.210
at the bottom of the tree.
MATT: Okay.

674
00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:48.480
The massive roc that is still clutching the sides,

675
00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:51.070
wings ready to take off again,

676
00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:54.160
squawks loudly again, shaking you with its proximity now.

677
00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:57.830
Your eardrums go high-pitched

678
00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:59.309
from the intensity of its scream,

679
00:25:59.309 --> 00:26:03.090
and you both vanish out of its sight.

680
00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:04.345
You see it get a bit flustered

681
00:26:04.345 --> 00:26:07.171
and look down with its keen eyesight,

682
00:26:07.171 --> 00:26:12.080
looking towards where you are and where you are,

683
00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:14.541
since you are the only ones currently in sight.

684
00:26:14.541 --> 00:26:16.710
You're getting close to within its vision,

685
00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:18.880
but you were the two that it has its sights on.

686
00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:21.730
All right, so it's now going to (whooshing)

687
00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:24.384
push off and come down towards you

688
00:26:24.384 --> 00:26:27.321
(whooshing) with its talons.

689
00:26:27.321 --> 00:26:30.246
That's going to be 23 to hit.

690
00:26:30.246 --> 00:26:32.505
TRAVIS: That hits.
MATT: All righty.

691
00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:36.620
You suffer...

692
00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:42.760
LAURA: No!

693
00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:47.270
MATT: 25 points of slashing damage and you are grappled.

694
00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:49.340
It has grabbed you in its talon.

695
00:26:51.362 --> 00:26:54.837
You are restrained while you are grappled.

696
00:26:54.837 --> 00:26:56.650
It swoops the rest of its movement,

697
00:26:56.650 --> 00:26:57.483
dragging you along with him.

698
00:26:57.483 --> 00:26:59.646
Its going to beak attack you.
LIAM: Okay.

699
00:26:59.646 --> 00:27:01.160
TRAVIS: You got something?

700
00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:04.070
MATT: That's going to be a 20 to hit.
LIAM: Shield.

701
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:05.610
MATT: Shield, all righty.

702
00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:07.430
LAURA: Thunder Step would be super cool

703
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:09.355
if you were stuck in a talon, huh?

704
00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:13.560
Thanks for that spell.

705
00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:15.650
MATT: As the beak slams down on you,

706
00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:17.560
it actually encompasses your body

707
00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:18.410
and it's about to snap shut

708
00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:20.490
before (whooshing) the energy

709
00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:23.090
pierces out like a bubble around you,

710
00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:25.044
and the mouth shuts, shooting you out

711
00:27:25.044 --> 00:27:27.540
like a bullet out of a gun,

712
00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:29.320
and you go skidding on your shield

713
00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:31.660
another 20, 30 feet before coming to rest.

714
00:27:33.603 --> 00:27:38.308
It's going to take up and it's about now 50 feet

715
00:27:38.308 --> 00:27:41.160
away and up on the ground with Fjord in its talon.

716
00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:43.154
LIAM: Too late to do anything before it goes as an action?

717
00:27:43.154 --> 00:27:45.185
MATT: That's it's turn. Now what do you do?

718
00:27:45.185 --> 00:27:46.990
LIAM: Oh. (stammers)

719
00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:47.930
MATT: Everyone can now take their action.

720
00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:50.304
LIAM: Am I on the ground?
MATT: You are on the ground.

721
00:27:50.304 --> 00:27:51.890
You're not knocked prone, I'll say.

722
00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:53.320
The shield helped right you.

723
00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:56.950
LIAM: I'm going to move my full 30 feet toward Fjord

724
00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:58.230
and the roc, and if it's in range

725
00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:03.230
I will pull out my caterpillar and cast Polymorph

726
00:28:03.986 --> 00:28:04.970
on the roc.

727
00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:06.030
MATT: On the roc?
LIAM: Yes.

728
00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:07.040
MATT: Okay.

729
00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:09.029
What form do you wish--
LIAM: Sparrow.

730
00:28:09.029 --> 00:28:11.446
MATT: Okay.
SAM: A larger roc.

731
00:28:12.291 --> 00:28:13.918
MATT: What is the DC on this?
LIAM: 17.

732
00:28:13.918 --> 00:28:15.446
MATT: 17.
LIAM: Yeah.

733
00:28:15.446 --> 00:28:17.029
MATT: Okay.

734
00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:21.573
Natural 20.
(groaning)

735
00:28:21.573 --> 00:28:24.440
I'm so sorry.
LAURA: That was so good, though.

736
00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:26.780
ASHLEY: That was such a good idea!
MATT: That was a great idea.

737
00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:28.176
Two natural 20s

738
00:28:28.176 --> 00:28:29.650
from this roc already.

739
00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:31.410
This thing is not fucking around.

740
00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:34.690
As you attempt to transmute its form

741
00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:36.310
into that of a much smaller bird,

742
00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:38.220
it seems to shrug off the magical effect

743
00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:40.180
as a brief flicker of its outline

744
00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:42.840
before the spell just dissipates. (hisses faintly)

745
00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:44.534
LIAM: Caleb watches. He's got the cocoon.

746
00:28:44.534 --> 00:28:49.534
He's going... Oh, <i>Scheiße</i>

747
00:28:50.699 --> 00:28:54.793
TALIESIN: Do beak and talons count as weapon attacks or no?

748
00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:57.030
MATT: They do.
TALIESIN: Okay.

749
00:28:57.030 --> 00:28:59.020
Since he's close enough at the moment,

750
00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:02.439
I'm going to try and cast Ray of Enfeeblement on the roc.

751
00:29:02.439 --> 00:29:05.547
MATT: Okay. What's the save on that?

752
00:29:05.547 --> 00:29:06.380
TALIESIN: Constitution.

753
00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:12.610
MATT: 26.
TALIESIN: Jesus H. Fucking Christ.

754
00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:14.500
LAURA: Okay, this roc is pretty powerful.

755
00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:16.300
SAM: This is hard roc.

756
00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:18.130
TRAVIS: Can I do something?
MATT: Yes, you can.

757
00:29:18.130 --> 00:29:19.720
TRAVIS: I haven't don't this before.

758
00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:23.736
With a bonus action, I will use my Relentless Hex

759
00:29:23.736 --> 00:29:25.960
which allows me to magically teleport

760
00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:29.293
up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see

761
00:29:29.293 --> 00:29:31.070
within five feet of the hexed target.

762
00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:33.110
I will bamf out of his claws,

763
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:35.580
and I'm going to appear right on his back,

764
00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:37.500
in between the shoulder blades.

765
00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:38.730
I'm going to try and wait for him

766
00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:42.616
to get somewhere above the alcove so I can ditch.

767
00:29:42.616 --> 00:29:43.449
MATT: Okay.

768
00:29:43.449 --> 00:29:44.990
TRAVIS: I'll just ride the fucking roc.

769
00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:45.823
MATT: As soon as you disappear,

770
00:29:45.823 --> 00:29:48.932
you grab the feathers and it's immediately

771
00:29:48.932 --> 00:29:51.383
your lips like (flapping) in the wind.

772
00:29:51.383 --> 00:29:53.850
TRAVIS: That was a bad idea! (screams)

773
00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:55.508
MATT: (screeches)

774
00:29:55.508 --> 00:29:57.810
SAM: That's Fjord's real voice.

775
00:29:57.810 --> 00:30:01.110
(laughter)

776
00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:03.040
MATT: So Fjord's on the back of this massive bird.

777
00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:05.492
Beau, Jester, anyone?
TRAVIS: Help me!

778
00:30:05.492 --> 00:30:06.862
MARISHA: How far away are we from it?

779
00:30:06.862 --> 00:30:09.579
MATT: Right now, you're about 70 feet from it.

780
00:30:09.579 --> 00:30:10.590
MARISHA: Ack!

781
00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:12.096
LAURA: Oh, god.

782
00:30:12.096 --> 00:30:12.929
Well, I'm not going to try

783
00:30:12.929 --> 00:30:13.762
to Polymorph it.
TALIESIN: 70 feet straight up,

784
00:30:13.762 --> 00:30:14.595
or 70 feet angular?
MATT: 70 feet outward,

785
00:30:14.595 --> 00:30:16.620
and about 30 feet up.

786
00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:19.340
ASHLEY: Wait Fjord, he's now on the bird.

787
00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:22.549
TRAVIS: I'm over here, I'm over here!

788
00:30:22.549 --> 00:30:24.310
SAM: Yee-haw!

789
00:30:25.537 --> 00:30:26.370
LAURA: I mean, he's on it.

790
00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:27.560
MARISHA: Unless you try to Polymorph it

791
00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:29.310
into something equally as rideable.

792
00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:33.370
SAM: Fjord can take a fall.

793
00:30:33.370 --> 00:30:34.720
TALIESIN: Well, a little late now,

794
00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:38.270
but also gets another attack if he does.

795
00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:39.936
MATT: Anyone else? Nothing?

796
00:30:39.936 --> 00:30:40.769
TALIESIN: I've already spent my move this turn.

797
00:30:40.769 --> 00:30:42.530
TRAVIS: All my movement if for some reason

798
00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:46.421
it starts to go over the alcove area.

799
00:30:46.421 --> 00:30:48.817
MATT: I mean, okay.

800
00:30:48.817 --> 00:30:50.490
It's going away from the tree at the moment,

801
00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:51.570
because it was swooping towards

802
00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:54.648
and after you and Caleb after it came down.

803
00:30:54.648 --> 00:30:55.870
You're just holding on right now.

804
00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:57.167
Anyone else doing anything?

805
00:30:57.167 --> 00:30:58.942
LIAM: Yeah. Go, go.

806
00:31:00.025 --> 00:31:01.325
SAM: I think I won't

807
00:31:01.325 --> 00:31:03.875
lose invisibility if I use an item, right?

808
00:31:03.875 --> 00:31:05.570
It's not an attack.
MATT: Depends on the item.

809
00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:07.140
LIAM: Oh, you're invisible.

810
00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:10.640
SAM: I have a potion that I made, a smoke bomb potion.

811
00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:11.473
MATT: You do.

812
00:31:11.473 --> 00:31:12.430
SAM: Would that--

813
00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:14.497
MATT: I'll say you won't lose invisibility. No.

814
00:31:14.497 --> 00:31:16.250
SAM: Okay. I hope that's okay.

815
00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:17.990
I'm going to smash that around us,

816
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:21.648
and so we have 20-foot radius of smoke around us.

817
00:31:21.648 --> 00:31:24.055
MATT: (whooshing) Suddenly, the area

818
00:31:24.055 --> 00:31:27.060
where you didn't know Nott was is now filled with smoke.

819
00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:29.505
There's just a plume of fog smoke

820
00:31:29.505 --> 00:31:32.440
that appears in a big cloud at the base of the tree.

821
00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:34.970
TALIESIN: Now we just can't see what's happening.

822
00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:37.140
SAM: He can't see us, or she.

823
00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:40.064
MARISHA: The nearest tree bough was 300 feet, right?

824
00:31:40.064 --> 00:31:40.897
MATT: Yep.

825
00:31:42.046 --> 00:31:43.910
MARISHA: It's like 70 feet.

826
00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:47.890
Is it trying to clear under the bough,

827
00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:49.480
or is it trying to go up and away from it?

828
00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:50.313
MATT: You don't know.

829
00:31:50.313 --> 00:31:51.146
Right now it's just going away.

830
00:31:51.146 --> 00:31:54.422
It coasted down to attack and grab Caleb off the ground,

831
00:31:54.422 --> 00:31:58.181
and now it's picking up and gaining gradual height

832
00:31:58.181 --> 00:32:00.140
as it's about 30 to 40 feet off the ground

833
00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:01.470
and about 70 feet out from the base.

834
00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:03.188
LIAM: So bird roc is climbing?
MATT: Yeah.

835
00:32:03.188 --> 00:32:05.940
LIAM: Caleb runs right towards Jester

836
00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:07.590
and yells get on my back! (whooshing)

837
00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:09.480
MATT: You've already cast Polymorph this round.

838
00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:10.854
I'm waiting for everyone else to finish what they're doing.

839
00:32:10.854 --> 00:32:11.687
LIAM: Oh, sure, okay.

840
00:32:11.687 --> 00:32:12.520
MATT: If you're doing anything.
LIAM: Yeah, yeah.

841
00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:13.994
MATT: If not, just tell me.

842
00:32:13.994 --> 00:32:15.356
MARISHA: I can try running back up to the tree.

843
00:32:15.356 --> 00:32:16.364
LAURA: I could try to cast Polymorph.

844
00:32:16.364 --> 00:32:17.327
SAM: Get on my back!

845
00:32:17.327 --> 00:32:19.853
MARISHA: But if he gets away from it.

846
00:32:19.853 --> 00:32:21.918
LAURA: I'm going to try and cast Polymorph.

847
00:32:21.918 --> 00:32:23.660
MATT: You're going to try and cast Polymorph?

848
00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:24.992
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: On who?

849
00:32:24.992 --> 00:32:26.893
LAURA: On the roc.
TALIESIN: Go for it.

850
00:32:26.893 --> 00:32:29.485
SAM: On Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson.

851
00:32:29.485 --> 00:32:32.000
LAURA: I'm going to try to turn him into a bat!

852
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:32.833
MATT: Okay.

853
00:32:33.970 --> 00:32:35.807
That is a ten. (laughs)

854
00:32:35.807 --> 00:32:37.862
(gasping)
ASHLEY: Yes!

855
00:32:37.862 --> 00:32:39.961
(screaming)

856
00:32:39.961 --> 00:32:42.557
TRAVIS: (screaming) Fuck!

857
00:32:42.557 --> 00:32:44.383
MATT: You watch as this massive bird...

858
00:32:44.383 --> 00:32:46.575
(whooshing)

859
00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:52.700
Fjord gets jettisoned at 120 feet per round

860
00:32:52.909 --> 00:32:55.587
outward in an arc, like out of a cannon.

861
00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:59.040
TRAVIS: Fuck you guys!

862
00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:00.310
This won't help me!

863
00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:02.110
LIAM: All right, if he's coasting,

864
00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:04.090
then I'm trying to gauge where he is,

865
00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:06.460
and holding a feather and trying

866
00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:07.950
to catch him as he gets within range.

867
00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:09.190
MATT: What's the range on Feather Fall?

868
00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:10.230
LIAM: It's 60 feet, isn't it?

869
00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:11.710
MATT: He is so far out of your range of Feather Fall.

870
00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:13.080
LIAM: Isn't he falling though?

871
00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:14.660
MATT: He was 70 feet away from you,

872
00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:16.820
and then now got shot even further,

873
00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:18.380
another 120 feet out that way.

874
00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:19.280
LIAM: Then if I can do something,

875
00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:20.740
I'm turning into an eagle and flying.

876
00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:21.760
TALIESIN: I'll grab on.

877
00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:23.430
MATT: How many more casts of Polymorph do you have?

878
00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:24.263
LIAM: One.

879
00:33:24.263 --> 00:33:25.563
MATT: It's a 4th-level spell?
LIAM: 4th-level.

880
00:33:25.563 --> 00:33:27.120
MATT: You have three fourth--
LIAM: I have one more

881
00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:28.530
4th-level spell slot left.
MATT: Okay, cool.

882
00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:29.363
Just making sure.

883
00:33:29.363 --> 00:33:30.196
LIAM: Yep, yep, yep.

884
00:33:30.196 --> 00:33:31.029
MATT: Okay, so you're turning into an eagle.

885
00:33:31.029 --> 00:33:31.920
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: Go for it.

886
00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:32.753
TALIESIN: I'm grabbing on.

887
00:33:32.753 --> 00:33:34.960
LIAM: Okay, I just go (whooshing).

888
00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:36.170
MATT: All right, you guys (whooshing)

889
00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:37.400
take off in that direction.

890
00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:38.783
The speed of the giant eagle?
LIAM: That's 80 feet.

891
00:33:38.783 --> 00:33:39.777
MATT: 80 feet, okay.

892
00:33:39.777 --> 00:33:42.130
You can't get to him, but you're heading that direction.

893
00:33:42.130 --> 00:33:42.963
LIAM: Can I...

894
00:33:43.876 --> 00:33:45.126
Yeah, okay.
MATT: All right.

895
00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:47.536
Fjord?
TRAVIS: Uh-huh?

896
00:33:47.536 --> 00:33:49.972
(wind blowing)

897
00:33:49.972 --> 00:33:53.132
TRAVIS: (groaning)
SAM: Do something!

898
00:33:54.476 --> 00:33:55.718
You got nothing?

899
00:33:55.718 --> 00:33:57.426
MATT: Make an acrobatics check.

900
00:33:57.426 --> 00:33:59.209
TRAVIS: That's it. I got nothing.

901
00:33:59.209 --> 00:34:00.520
MATT: Make an acrobatics check.

902
00:34:01.425 --> 00:34:03.270
SAM: Pray to The Wildmother.

903
00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:04.420
TRAVIS: It's a straight roll.

904
00:34:06.270 --> 00:34:08.619
Nine.
(groaning)

905
00:34:08.619 --> 00:34:09.452
TALIESIN: You're going to be fine.

906
00:34:09.452 --> 00:34:11.540
MATT: You're not trained necessarily

907
00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:12.860
how to best break your fall

908
00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:15.350
when jettisoned via a roc.
TRAVIS: Flying?

909
00:34:15.350 --> 00:34:16.183
No.
MATT: Yeah.

910
00:34:16.183 --> 00:34:17.680
It's a new experience for you.

911
00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:18.600
For a moment, it's beautiful,

912
00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:21.690
this view and the wind in your hair.

913
00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:22.523
TRAVIS: Quiet calm.

914
00:34:22.523 --> 00:34:23.638
LAURA: Did you get all of his rolling in his hands?

915
00:34:23.638 --> 00:34:25.652
SAM: It's just two. That's two dice.

916
00:34:25.652 --> 00:34:29.370
MATT: Then white hot pain, dirt, dirt,

917
00:34:29.370 --> 00:34:33.853
dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, soreness.

918
00:34:35.895 --> 00:34:36.728
TALIESIN: Well, we'll see.

919
00:34:36.728 --> 00:34:39.215
(tense music)

920
00:34:41.652 --> 00:34:43.282
LAURA: Oh, god.

921
00:34:43.282 --> 00:34:45.640
Did I kill Fjord?

922
00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:48.702
TALIESIN: How far away are we on the eagle?

923
00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:55.410
MATT: Take 44 points of bludgeoning damage.

924
00:34:55.410 --> 00:34:57.966
TRAVIS: I'm okay.
SAM: You're okay?

925
00:34:57.966 --> 00:34:58.799
Didn't you take 25 before?

926
00:34:58.799 --> 00:34:59.632
LAURA: Yeah, he's got more than that.

927
00:34:59.632 --> 00:35:00.465
SAM: Wow!

928
00:35:00.465 --> 00:35:01.530
LAURA: He's really tough.

929
00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:03.590
MATT: You're lying on your back,

930
00:35:03.590 --> 00:35:06.980
just torn up, rocks and dust and scrapes.

931
00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:11.980
TRAVIS: (groaning)
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)

932
00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:16.128
LAURA: I jump out of the alcove. Fjord!

933
00:35:16.128 --> 00:35:17.408
TALIESIN: It's going to be fine.

934
00:35:17.408 --> 00:35:19.680
Hey, how you feeling?
TRAVIS: (shushes)

935
00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:20.941
TALIESIN: Little bit, little bit.

936
00:35:20.941 --> 00:35:22.427
TRAVIS: Make sure it's far away.

937
00:35:22.427 --> 00:35:24.040
Make sure it's far away.

938
00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:25.510
TALIESIN: Okay, we're just going to give you

939
00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:26.860
a little bit of a pick-me-up,

940
00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:29.110
and I'm just going to do Cure Wounds,

941
00:35:29.110 --> 00:35:30.480
just to get you back up and running.

942
00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:31.313
LIAM: (screeches)

943
00:35:31.313 --> 00:35:33.429
TALIESIN: How you feeling, man?

944
00:35:33.429 --> 00:35:34.745
TRAVIS: Just fucking cure me.

945
00:35:34.745 --> 00:35:35.762
TALIESIN: Okay.

946
00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:40.365
I'm casting that at 4th-level,

947
00:35:40.365 --> 00:35:43.648
so that's a 4d8 plus five.

948
00:35:43.648 --> 00:35:45.089
ASHLEY: An indent in the ground.

949
00:35:45.972 --> 00:35:48.398
TRAVIS: Yeah, just the outline.

950
00:35:48.398 --> 00:35:49.231
TALIESIN: That's terrible.

951
00:35:51.298 --> 00:35:52.438
Nine, 14.

952
00:35:52.438 --> 00:35:55.330
That's just 20 points of healing,

953
00:35:55.330 --> 00:35:56.580
just to get you a little--

954
00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:58.930
TRAVIS: Take it. Thank you.

955
00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:01.679
TALIESIN: Why don't you hop on, and we've got a second

956
00:36:01.679 --> 00:36:02.950
where there's not going to be,

957
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:05.340
how long is it just going to be a bat,

958
00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:08.299
out of curiosity?
LIAM: (screeching)

959
00:36:08.299 --> 00:36:11.370
LAURA: I think Polymorph, it's an hour long.

960
00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:13.150
TALIESIN: Actually, this is an interesting question.

961
00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:14.170
I can talk to animals.

962
00:36:14.170 --> 00:36:16.680
Does that mean that the eagle

963
00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:18.648
can comprehend everything I'm saying,

964
00:36:18.648 --> 00:36:20.282
since I can talk to animals?

965
00:36:20.282 --> 00:36:23.020
MATT: Yeah, he can comprehend what anyone's saying.

966
00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:27.640
TALIESIN: You want to take a second to drop Fjord off

967
00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:29.420
and maybe take a quick look in that nest

968
00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:30.730
and see what's up there?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

969
00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:31.938
I like the drop me off part.

970
00:36:31.938 --> 00:36:34.300
LAURA: I'm running towards them as much as I can.

971
00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:35.880
TALIESIN: We're flying straight back now.

972
00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:36.713
SAM: Don't worry, Yasha.

973
00:36:36.713 --> 00:36:38.340
We're safe in this cloud of smoke!

974
00:36:40.459 --> 00:36:43.140
ASHLEY: (coughs) I start walking out.

975
00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:44.810
SAM: No, don't leave me here!

976
00:36:44.810 --> 00:36:47.415
MARISHA: I follow behind--

977
00:36:47.415 --> 00:36:48.960
TALIESIN: Can we both fit on you or no?

978
00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:49.793
LIAM: I don't know.

979
00:36:49.793 --> 00:36:50.880
That's a question for the DM.

980
00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:52.940
Can two people ride on a giant eagle?

981
00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:54.510
MATT: One person can ride on a giant eagle.

982
00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:56.924
TALIESIN: Okay, so I'll go back with him,

983
00:36:56.924 --> 00:36:58.770
and I think you know the plan now.

984
00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:02.310
LIAM: Yeah, I'm going to fly low to the ground.

985
00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:04.650
There's a cloud of smoke and I'm going

986
00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:06.701
to look for Beauregard on the ground.

987
00:37:06.701 --> 00:37:07.582
MATT: Okay.

988
00:37:07.582 --> 00:37:10.260
You go ahead and make your way over to the cloud of smoke.

989
00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:12.620
MARISHA: I'm following behind Jester a little bit,

990
00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:13.453
like 20 feet or so.

991
00:37:13.453 --> 00:37:15.000
MATT: You'd be able to see both Jester

992
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.454
and Beauregard emerge from the smoke cloud.

993
00:37:16.454 --> 00:37:17.370
LIAM: (screeches)

994
00:37:17.370 --> 00:37:20.410
LAURA: Fjord, Fjord, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

995
00:37:20.410 --> 00:37:21.300
TRAVIS: Why?

996
00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:23.604
Why are you sorry?
LAURA: Cure Wounds.

997
00:37:23.604 --> 00:37:25.233
TRAVIS: Oh! (hums)

998
00:37:25.233 --> 00:37:26.516
LAURA: 3rd-level.

999
00:37:27.641 --> 00:37:29.974
LIAM: (screeches)

1000
00:37:33.931 --> 00:37:34.764
Ooh!

1001
00:37:34.764 --> 00:37:36.110
MATT: This little impact on your shoulder.

1002
00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:37.413
You look and there's this little bat (flapping).

1003
00:37:37.413 --> 00:37:39.820
LAURA: 25.
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Ooh!

1004
00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:40.653
SAM: It's still trying to attack?

1005
00:37:40.653 --> 00:37:43.520
LAURA: No, no! Don't attack it.
MARISHA: Don't attack it!

1006
00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:47.040
LAURA: You just healed 25 points.
TRAVIS: 25?

1007
00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:50.544
LIAM: Catch it in a butterfly net.
TRAVIS: Thank you kindly.

1008
00:37:50.544 --> 00:37:52.560
MATT: (thwacking)
(laughter)

1009
00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:54.720
SAM: Any damage?
MATT: Nope.

1010
00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:55.880
LAURA: Can we catch him?

1011
00:37:57.199 --> 00:37:58.630
MATT: What's your armor class, Fjord?

1012
00:37:58.630 --> 00:37:59.735
TRAVIS: 17.

1013
00:37:59.735 --> 00:38:03.140
MATT: (thwacking)
(laughter)

1014
00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:04.830
Just (squeaks) little squeaks,

1015
00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:06.550
and it's trying to bite through,

1016
00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:08.030
and it's just pissed off.

1017
00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:09.830
LAURA: I take my little cape off and I try

1018
00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:13.460
to catch him in my hood.
LIAM: Catch him, derry!

1019
00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:14.450
Catch him!

1020
00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:15.283
MATT: You wrap it in there,

1021
00:38:15.283 --> 00:38:16.837
and you now have this little satchel with a--

1022
00:38:16.837 --> 00:38:20.000
TRAVIS: How long's that last?

1023
00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.790
LAURA: This is an hour long.

1024
00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:24.040
LIAM: Fjord's out there pissing himself, derry.

1025
00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:26.375
TRAVIS: Can we just put him in the bag of holding?

1026
00:38:26.375 --> 00:38:29.352
TALIESIN: No, I don't recommend that.

1027
00:38:29.352 --> 00:38:30.480
LAURA: Well, it'll kill him.

1028
00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:31.720
TALIESIN: Because magic versus magic,

1029
00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:32.970
a lot of weird things can happen.

1030
00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:34.630
You don't want to cross spells.
LAURA: That's true.

1031
00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:35.530
Plus, we don't know.

1032
00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:38.080
This could be a mama bird and her babies are up there.

1033
00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:39.300
TALIESIN: I think it very much is.

1034
00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:40.850
LAURA: She had a nest, after all.

1035
00:38:40.850 --> 00:38:42.418
TRAVIS: They're going up and check it out

1036
00:38:42.418 --> 00:38:44.406
before we go in this cave to hide?

1037
00:38:45.848 --> 00:38:47.331
LIAM: (screeches)

1038
00:38:47.331 --> 00:38:52.331
MARISHA: Shut up!
(laughter)

1039
00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:55.783
Fucking, my ear. God.

1040
00:38:55.783 --> 00:38:57.540
TALIESIN: Look up there. Grab anything.

1041
00:38:57.540 --> 00:38:59.031
Don't hurt the eggs or anything.

1042
00:38:59.031 --> 00:39:00.373
Don't disturb anything.

1043
00:39:00.373 --> 00:39:03.510
MARISHA: You want me to go back up there into that nest?

1044
00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:07.140
TALIESIN: Well, on top of this guy.
LIAM: (screeches)

1045
00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:07.973
MARISHA: Okay.

1046
00:39:07.973 --> 00:39:10.880
TALIESIN: You might want to take the bag too,

1047
00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:12.980
might be a clever--
MARISHA: Oh, just leave him up there

1048
00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:14.360
and then we can fly down?
LAURA: Yeah.

1049
00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:15.540
Well, yeah.

1050
00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:16.790
TALIESIN: You can take the bag and grab

1051
00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:18.130
anything interesting up there,

1052
00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:20.123
put it in the bag, and then come on down.

1053
00:39:20.123 --> 00:39:24.280
MARISHA: Okay.
LIAM: (screeches)

1054
00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:27.297
MATT: So you guys take off up towards the tree.

1055
00:39:28.409 --> 00:39:29.242
Okay.

1056
00:39:29.242 --> 00:39:32.345
MARISHA: I'm going to keep an eye out for any more rocs,

1057
00:39:32.345 --> 00:39:34.222
make sure this isn't mama roc,

1058
00:39:34.222 --> 00:39:36.210
and there's not a daddy roc somewhere.

1059
00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:37.043
MATT: Okay.

1060
00:39:37.043 --> 00:39:38.340
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and calm the roc.

1061
00:39:39.678 --> 00:39:42.690
TRAVIS: You can't calm the roc.
TALIESIN: I calm the roc.

1062
00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:45.326
MATT: Make an animal handling check.
MARISHA: 20 total.

1063
00:39:45.326 --> 00:39:47.770
MATT: Okay, you're keeping an eye out as you're flying up.

1064
00:39:47.770 --> 00:39:48.990
SAM: We saw the nest before.

1065
00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:51.110
LAURA and LIAM: Yeah.
TALIESIN: 12.

1066
00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:53.087
LIAM: I don't know if I did though.

1067
00:39:53.087 --> 00:39:54.750
MATT: You got an angry roc bat in a satchel.

1068
00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:57.610
It's not working.
TALIESIN: Ah, oh well.

1069
00:39:57.610 --> 00:39:58.870
MATT: You hear it squeaking

1070
00:39:58.870 --> 00:40:00.380
as it's constantly fighting against it,

1071
00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:01.520
but it doesn't have a lot of strength to it.

1072
00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:02.399
TRAVIS: I haven't seen an angry roc bat

1073
00:40:02.399 --> 00:40:03.569
since an Ozzy Osbourne concert.

1074
00:40:03.569 --> 00:40:05.123
MATT and MARISHA: Ooh!

1075
00:40:05.123 --> 00:40:09.029
MATT: You make your way back up to the top of the tree,

1076
00:40:09.029 --> 00:40:11.765
stop in one of the lower branches,

1077
00:40:11.765 --> 00:40:15.284
nearby where you guys had left off.

1078
00:40:15.284 --> 00:40:18.508
You stop and you're looking around.

1079
00:40:18.508 --> 00:40:20.650
You vaguely recall where you saw

1080
00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:24.800
at least the base of the nest.

1081
00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:25.860
Go ahead and both make a perception check

1082
00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:26.693
for me if you don't mind.

1083
00:40:26.693 --> 00:40:28.280
MARISHA: I rolled a 20 on that first one.

1084
00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:29.113
MATT: That's right.

1085
00:40:29.113 --> 00:40:29.946
You already made a check.
MATT: Do I do another one?

1086
00:40:29.946 --> 00:40:30.980
Okay.

1087
00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:32.050
MATT: Well, you were looking for possible other rocs?

1088
00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:33.360
MARISHA: Birds.
MATT: In the tree?

1089
00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:34.193
MARISHA: Uh-huh.
MATT: Yeah.

1090
00:40:34.193 --> 00:40:37.151
I'll say yeah. Then I'll allow it to stick. What'd you get?

1091
00:40:37.151 --> 00:40:38.194
LIAM: (screeches)
MATT: Okay.

1092
00:40:38.194 --> 00:40:39.700
You do see the nest.

1093
00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:42.213
You see the cluster of large branches

1094
00:40:42.213 --> 00:40:44.150
and leaves and broken wood,

1095
00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:45.000
and now you're looking up there.

1096
00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.590
You can see there's a wagon wheel

1097
00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:47.740
and there's all sorts of shit

1098
00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:50.031
that's just been mashed into this nest.

1099
00:40:50.031 --> 00:40:51.745
LIAM: (screeches)

1100
00:40:51.745 --> 00:40:52.578
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1101
00:40:52.578 --> 00:40:54.236
Go, go.

1102
00:40:54.236 --> 00:40:56.506
MATT: Leaping from branch to branch, eventually--

1103
00:40:56.506 --> 00:40:57.510
MARISHA: Looking for shiny.

1104
00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:58.661
Looking for satchels.

1105
00:40:58.661 --> 00:41:00.080
Looking for bags.

1106
00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:00.913
Looking for--

1107
00:41:00.913 --> 00:41:02.350
MATT: The first thing you notice

1108
00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:03.770
when you get up there in the view,

1109
00:41:03.770 --> 00:41:07.845
one there's carts and

1110
00:41:09.462 --> 00:41:12.587
looks like a part of a building, like a piece of a ruin,

1111
00:41:12.587 --> 00:41:14.020
that was jammed in here.

1112
00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:15.570
It's just been assembling its nest

1113
00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:17.860
from whatever a giant bird could find

1114
00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:21.480
amongst the Barbed Fields and the surrounding area.

1115
00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:23.630
It's very Katamari Damacy,

1116
00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:26.713
the way this nest has been built.

1117
00:41:26.713 --> 00:41:28.632
You do see also within there,

1118
00:41:28.632 --> 00:41:32.697
the feathers freshly starting to come in,

1119
00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:36.650
a baby roc.
MARISHA, LAURA, and ASHLEY: Aww!

1120
00:41:36.650 --> 00:41:38.260
LIAM: Bigger or smaller than Caleb is right now?

1121
00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:40.740
MATT: Oh, I'd say a little bit smaller than Caleb,

1122
00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:42.700
but only barely.
LIAM: (screeches)

1123
00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:45.460
MATT: It's just like they're (squawking).

1124
00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:47.571
TRAVIS: Barf in its mouth.

1125
00:41:47.571 --> 00:41:51.304
LIAM and MATT: (screeching)

1126
00:41:51.304 --> 00:41:52.425
LIAM: (flapping)

1127
00:41:52.425 --> 00:41:53.258
MARISHA: Is it just one?

1128
00:41:53.258 --> 00:41:55.275
MATT: Just one.
SAM: The rest of the episode is just this.

1129
00:41:57.152 --> 00:41:58.730
LIAM: Would it be so bad?
SAM: I know.

1130
00:42:02.462 --> 00:42:03.295
LIAM: (screeches)

1131
00:42:03.295 --> 00:42:04.770
MARISHA: It's cute, I know.

1132
00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:08.670
It's adorable.

1133
00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:09.690
I want shiny shit.

1134
00:42:09.690 --> 00:42:11.620
Is there shiny shit in the nest?

1135
00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:14.000
Has it been hoarding?

1136
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.360
MATT: There might be, but you'd have

1137
00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:16.680
to go through, because it's--

1138
00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:17.940
LIAM: Are we in the nest now?

1139
00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:19.050
MATT: Well, you guys are up

1140
00:42:19.050 --> 00:42:21.010
in the branch above, looking down into the nest.

1141
00:42:21.010 --> 00:42:22.896
You can go into the nest, if you like.

1142
00:42:22.896 --> 00:42:27.800
It is a cluster of massive, dried bird guano

1143
00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:31.934
over these heavy,

1144
00:42:31.934 --> 00:42:35.851
woven meshes of branch and leaves and other pieces

1145
00:42:35.851 --> 00:42:38.850
of errant material that this creature has assembled for it.

1146
00:42:38.850 --> 00:42:40.790
Because it's porous, all branches

1147
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:42.620
and whatever else can be found,

1148
00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:43.500
there probably are shiny things in there probably,

1149
00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:45.340
but you'd have to sift through it

1150
00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:47.273
and search for a while to find anything.

1151
00:42:47.273 --> 00:42:49.888
MARISHA: That is covered in bird shit and saliva--

1152
00:42:49.888 --> 00:42:50.721
LIAM: (screeches)

1153
00:42:50.721 --> 00:42:53.487
MARISHA: -- and egg gunk.
LIAM: Caleb shits.

1154
00:42:54.502 --> 00:42:56.420
LIAM: (screeches)

1155
00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:58.778
MARISHA: I'm trying to understand your point

1156
00:42:58.778 --> 00:42:59.769
that you're making.

1157
00:42:59.769 --> 00:43:03.210
LIAM: I turn and slide her down, that's it,

1158
00:43:03.210 --> 00:43:04.540
slide her down along one wing.

1159
00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:06.492
MARISHA: Aw, what the fuck?

1160
00:43:06.492 --> 00:43:08.915
MATT: (thumping) Into the nest.

1161
00:43:08.915 --> 00:43:12.955
You stop and you look up at this 12-foot baby bird.

1162
00:43:12.955 --> 00:43:17.688
LIAM and MATT: (squawking)

1163
00:43:17.688 --> 00:43:19.346
LIAM: Not what I meant, but it's fine.

1164
00:43:19.346 --> 00:43:22.110
MARISHA: Hey, buddy.
MATT: Is that not what you meant?

1165
00:43:22.110 --> 00:43:23.490
LIAM: I meant to set her down here

1166
00:43:23.490 --> 00:43:26.551
and me go down in, but this is funny.

1167
00:43:26.551 --> 00:43:29.290
MATT: We're going for it.

1168
00:43:29.290 --> 00:43:33.349
MARISHA: I take out my staff and I'm just like: Scritches?

1169
00:43:33.349 --> 00:43:35.099
I give him scritches.

1170
00:43:36.521 --> 00:43:38.376
TRAVIS: Did you say scritches?

1171
00:43:38.376 --> 00:43:40.660
MATT: Do an animal handling check.
MARISHA: Oh, fuck me.

1172
00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:41.827
LAURA: You can do this, Beau.

1173
00:43:41.827 --> 00:43:43.280
LIAM: With advantage because of Dagon?

1174
00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:45.680
MATT: Dagon does not exist in this world.

1175
00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:47.590
MARISHA: Ooh, okay, okay, okay.

1176
00:43:47.590 --> 00:43:48.705
16.

1177
00:43:48.705 --> 00:43:51.362
MATT: 16.
MARISHA: Yeah.

1178
00:43:51.362 --> 00:43:53.820
MATT: It starts doing the hungry eye.

1179
00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:55.312
It hasn't been fed recently.

1180
00:43:55.312 --> 00:43:57.380
You get the sense that this isn't

1181
00:43:57.380 --> 00:44:00.590
a classic mama bird eating pellets and stuff.

1182
00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:02.010
This thing probably eats flesh.

1183
00:44:02.010 --> 00:44:03.140
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1184
00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:05.460
MATT: You look like a tasty morsel.

1185
00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:07.120
As you approach, you take your staff

1186
00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:08.470
and scratch the side of its face

1187
00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:11.978
and it's like (squawking and chomping).

1188
00:44:12.939 --> 00:44:14.130
MARISHA: Mm, mm-hmm, itchies?

1189
00:44:14.130 --> 00:44:18.690
Yeah, yeah, okay.

1190
00:44:18.690 --> 00:44:20.870
I take out...

1191
00:44:21.836 --> 00:44:23.503
Fuck! What do I fucking have?

1192
00:44:23.503 --> 00:44:24.670
Do I have a ration?

1193
00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:26.370
Take out a ration.

1194
00:44:26.370 --> 00:44:27.620
Travelers kit and just...

1195
00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:29.290
TRAVIS: Do you feed it a ration?
MARISHA: Yeah.

1196
00:44:29.290 --> 00:44:31.000
Throw it away from me.

1197
00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.031
TRAVIS: Here's a pepperoni.
MARISHA: To him.

1198
00:44:33.031 --> 00:44:35.000
MATT: (chomping) Catches it in midair.

1199
00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:35.833
MARISHA: Fuck!

1200
00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:42.430
Fucking faster than I thought.

1201
00:44:42.952 --> 00:44:45.515
Fuck. Thought it'd go over.

1202
00:44:45.515 --> 00:44:48.413
MATT: (squawking)

1203
00:44:48.413 --> 00:44:49.435
MARISHA: Caleb!

1204
00:44:49.435 --> 00:44:52.110
MATT: It's now expectant of more food

1205
00:44:52.110 --> 00:44:53.960
to come now that you've begun the feeding cycle.

1206
00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:58.613
MARISHA: I do the dog fake out thing.

1207
00:44:58.613 --> 00:44:59.750
MATT: Of what?

1208
00:44:59.750 --> 00:45:00.923
Another ration?

1209
00:45:00.923 --> 00:45:01.890
What else you got?

1210
00:45:01.890 --> 00:45:03.077
LIAM: Oh, I thought you were faking it.

1211
00:45:03.077 --> 00:45:05.970
MATT: Are you faking it?
MARISHA: I've got some ball bearings.

1212
00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:07.948
I take some ball bearings.

1213
00:45:07.948 --> 00:45:09.490
LIAM: (screeches)

1214
00:45:09.490 --> 00:45:11.073
MATT: Make a deception check.

1215
00:45:11.073 --> 00:45:14.621
LAURA: Poor baby bird. Going to eat some ball bearings.

1216
00:45:14.621 --> 00:45:16.020
LIAM: -- push through in here as well, or is too hard?

1217
00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:16.853
MATT: Yeah, you can make your way down.

1218
00:45:16.853 --> 00:45:17.940
You're just on a branch right above it,

1219
00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:19.440
so you can just leap down onto it.

1220
00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:20.273
MARISHA: 15.

1221
00:45:20.273 --> 00:45:21.106
LIAM: Just its little outer circle.

1222
00:45:21.106 --> 00:45:23.454
MATT: 15, it like (squawks).

1223
00:45:23.454 --> 00:45:24.950
MARISHA: I back away.

1224
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:26.980
MATT: You back away a little bit in the nest.

1225
00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:28.165
The nest itself is about,

1226
00:45:28.165 --> 00:45:31.863
I'd say, 45 feet from side-to-side.

1227
00:45:31.863 --> 00:45:34.840
It's a massive nest

1228
00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:38.360
and it is lumpy and precarious.

1229
00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:39.510
TRAVIS: Let's just adopt this bird.

1230
00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:41.710
It's no problem.
MATT: Sure.

1231
00:45:41.710 --> 00:45:42.543
More pets.

1232
00:45:42.543 --> 00:45:44.290
That goes well with you guys.

1233
00:45:44.290 --> 00:45:48.730
LIAM: Caleb moseys up next to Beauregard. (screeches)

1234
00:45:48.730 --> 00:45:51.050
MARISHA: Do I see anything, just looking down

1235
00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:52.900
as I'm running around?
MATT: Make a perception check.

1236
00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:55.101
MARISHA: That looks worthy of investigating.

1237
00:45:55.101 --> 00:45:57.480
LAURA: Roll a 20, roll a 20, roll a 20!

1238
00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:58.313
MATT: You're doing a big old thing?

1239
00:45:58.313 --> 00:46:00.010
LIAM: I'm making a little bit of presentation

1240
00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:01.490
to get attention.
MATT: Okay.

1241
00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:02.610
The creature is now looking

1242
00:46:02.610 --> 00:46:03.790
for wherever the ball bearings went,

1243
00:46:03.790 --> 00:46:05.990
turns back to you and goes (squawks).

1244
00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:09.360
MARISHA: Perception is eight.
MATT: Eight?

1245
00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:12.010
MARISHA: Sorry.
MATT: (groans) It's hard to tell.

1246
00:46:12.010 --> 00:46:13.300
You can see part of a vardo.

1247
00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:18.253
You can see clusters of

1248
00:46:18.253 --> 00:46:20.820
sacks that have torn and broken inward.

1249
00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:22.495
There could be. You just don't see anything

1250
00:46:22.495 --> 00:46:23.750
that's a sign of where things might be.

1251
00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:24.890
You're just going to have to do

1252
00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:26.590
a general search over time,

1253
00:46:26.590 --> 00:46:28.667
and it'll take a while.

1254
00:46:28.667 --> 00:46:29.500
MARISHA: Do we want to do that?

1255
00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:31.999
TRAVIS: Yeah, totally. It's just you guys. It's not us.

1256
00:46:31.999 --> 00:46:33.990
MATT: Meanwhile, the baby's coming up to you.

1257
00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:37.085
MARISHA: You entertain the kid.
LIAM: (squawks)

1258
00:46:37.085 --> 00:46:38.942
MARISHA: I'm going to try and do as best as I fucking can

1259
00:46:38.942 --> 00:46:41.410
with the rest of your Polymorph time, okay?

1260
00:46:41.410 --> 00:46:43.217
The rest of that Polymorph time.

1261
00:46:43.217 --> 00:46:45.730
But we need a ten-minute lead time to go, okay?

1262
00:46:45.730 --> 00:46:47.010
MATT: It's opening its mouth now in the same

1263
00:46:47.010 --> 00:46:48.440
expectant feed me kind of way.

1264
00:46:48.440 --> 00:46:49.430
LAURA: It's going to take us more than ten minutes

1265
00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:50.430
to get away from the other one.

1266
00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:51.994
MARISHA: That's why I'm saying we need to get down.

1267
00:46:51.994 --> 00:46:54.573
I'm going to start investigating,

1268
00:46:54.573 --> 00:46:56.480
going through stacks.
MATT: Make an investigation check.

1269
00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:59.040
MARISHA: The more ornate the better.

1270
00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:00.330
MATT: We'll say about...

1271
00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:03.410
Flying to the top, the slow approach, up to here,

1272
00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:06.990
I'd say roughly about five minutes to go all that,

1273
00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:08.638
ten minutes for the first search.

1274
00:47:08.638 --> 00:47:09.500
MARISHA: 15.

1275
00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:10.600
LIAM: I'm going to try to make friends

1276
00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:12.190
and canoodle a little bit.

1277
00:47:12.190 --> 00:47:14.200
LAURA: I'm going to shout up when it's been 30 minutes.

1278
00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:15.574
MATT: Okay.

1279
00:47:15.574 --> 00:47:17.424
We'll get to that in a second.

1280
00:47:17.424 --> 00:47:21.021
Going through, it's precarious in places.

1281
00:47:21.021 --> 00:47:22.530
At one point you do step across,

1282
00:47:22.530 --> 00:47:24.820
and part of the nest snaps underneath,

1283
00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:27.780
but you're a monk and you catch yourself.

1284
00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:28.740
If you can run up a tree,

1285
00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:31.526
you can not fall out of a nest from a small break.

1286
00:47:31.526 --> 00:47:32.720
Slows you down a little bit.

1287
00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:34.351
You go through and you find

1288
00:47:34.351 --> 00:47:37.240
small clusters of coins: some copper, some silver

1289
00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:38.400
for that first ten minutes.

1290
00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:42.050
You find a couple of sacks that contain

1291
00:47:42.050 --> 00:47:43.520
what probably would have been some sort

1292
00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:45.170
of a merchant caravan that was assaulted

1293
00:47:45.170 --> 00:47:47.125
by this creature a while back,

1294
00:47:47.125 --> 00:47:51.188
and what comes to about 210 gold pieces

1295
00:47:51.188 --> 00:47:54.160
and 15 silver pieces, so you can write that down.

1296
00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:55.400
MARISHA: 210 gold.

1297
00:47:57.230 --> 00:48:00.440
SAM: Down below, I'm going to implore the others.

1298
00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:02.996
Maybe we should get the moorbounders ready to go.

1299
00:48:02.996 --> 00:48:04.454
LAURA: Yeah, that's a good idea.

1300
00:48:04.454 --> 00:48:06.387
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. Let's ready everybody.

1301
00:48:06.387 --> 00:48:07.974
MATT: You guys go and start gathering the moorbounders,

1302
00:48:07.974 --> 00:48:10.790
getting them prepped and fed and ready.

1303
00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:13.988
TRAVIS: We should wait for night, right?

1304
00:48:13.988 --> 00:48:15.060
LAURA: No, remember?

1305
00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:16.814
Everything's really powerful at night.

1306
00:48:16.814 --> 00:48:18.480
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, good call.
LAURA: We should travel during the day.

1307
00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:19.313
TRAVIS: Yep, sorry.

1308
00:48:19.313 --> 00:48:21.120
MATT: It's still pretty early in the day, too.

1309
00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:21.953
You guys woke up not

1310
00:48:21.953 --> 00:48:23.060
that long ago when all this began.

1311
00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:24.065
TRAVIS: Sorry, I just got a little scrambled.

1312
00:48:24.065 --> 00:48:25.734
I'm all right.

1313
00:48:25.734 --> 00:48:27.960
LAURA: I'm really sorry, Fjord.
TRAVIS: No, it's great.

1314
00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:31.094
SAM: I think I can see your elbow, like your bone, the bone.

1315
00:48:31.094 --> 00:48:32.361
TRAVIS: (screams)

1316
00:48:32.361 --> 00:48:33.194
(popping bone)

1317
00:48:33.194 --> 00:48:34.876
(groaning and laughter)

1318
00:48:37.084 --> 00:48:38.500
MATT: You start getting close to it

1319
00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:39.800
to try and befriend it?
LIAM: (screeches)

1320
00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:41.494
MATT: It instinctually reaches out to bite towards you.

1321
00:48:41.494 --> 00:48:42.820
You got too close.

1322
00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:45.400
It's a 15.

1323
00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:47.150
What's your armor class as a giant eagle?

1324
00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:48.803
LIAM: 13.
MATT: 13.

1325
00:48:49.829 --> 00:48:53.630
You take six points of piercing damage.

1326
00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:56.380
LIAM: I hop back a few steps.
MATT: Okay.

1327
00:48:56.380 --> 00:48:57.780
LIAM: Six points, you said?
MATT: Yeah.

1328
00:48:57.780 --> 00:48:59.440
It's just they're going (squawks),

1329
00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:01.310
mouth still open, throat wide.

1330
00:49:01.310 --> 00:49:03.230
It's expecting its next bit of its meal.

1331
00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:05.270
TRAVIS: Feed that bird.

1332
00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:06.103
LAURA: Puke in its mouth!

1333
00:49:06.103 --> 00:49:07.060
MATT: Make another investigation check

1334
00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:07.920
for the nest ten minutes.

1335
00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:09.510
You're pushing on the half an hour mark here now.

1336
00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:13.423
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil!
TRAVIS and SAM: (gagging)

1337
00:49:13.423 --> 00:49:15.120
MARISHA: Goddamn it.

1338
00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:16.976
Oh, actually, it's not as bad as I thought.

1339
00:49:16.976 --> 00:49:19.550
TRAVIS: Give him that hairball.

1340
00:49:19.550 --> 00:49:21.827
LAURA: Stop it!
MARISHA: 20 total!

1341
00:49:21.827 --> 00:49:23.400
MATT: 20 total?
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1342
00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:26.390
MATT and MARISHA: That's not bad.

1343
00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:28.640
MATT: You manage to make your way over towards

1344
00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:31.750
the broken vardo and pull open a section of it.

1345
00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:33.250
On the inside, there are drawers,

1346
00:49:33.250 --> 00:49:34.083
and you rummage through the drawers

1347
00:49:34.083 --> 00:49:35.360
and you pull open two of them.

1348
00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:36.520
One of them contains two sets

1349
00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:38.646
of very nice silk clothing.

1350
00:49:38.646 --> 00:49:43.422
The one below that has a small lockbox that is made of iron.

1351
00:49:44.398 --> 00:49:46.530
You pocket that.
MARISHA: Fuck yeah.

1352
00:49:46.530 --> 00:49:47.510
LAURA: Clothes, too?
MARISHA: Yeah.

1353
00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:50.550
I'll throw them around my belt.

1354
00:49:50.550 --> 00:49:51.749
LAURA: You've got the bag of holding!

1355
00:49:51.749 --> 00:49:54.470
MARISHA: Oh, that's right! I have the bag of holding.

1356
00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:56.937
MATT: You hear Jester shout.

1357
00:49:56.937 --> 00:49:59.690
You heard Jester shout out from below.

1358
00:49:59.690 --> 00:50:01.080
LAURA: Use Thaumaturgy so she can hear me.

1359
00:50:01.938 --> 00:50:02.780
Hey y'all!

1360
00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:05.360
It's been a while and this things going to turn back

1361
00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:07.365
and we need to get away and stuff!

1362
00:50:07.365 --> 00:50:08.660
LIAM: (screeches)

1363
00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:10.561
MARISHA: Are you counting with your keen bird brain?

1364
00:50:10.561 --> 00:50:13.878
You're counting seconds?
LIAM: (screeches)

1365
00:50:13.878 --> 00:50:15.080
MARISHA: (sighs)

1366
00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:16.522
MATT: Jester.
LAURA: What?

1367
00:50:16.522 --> 00:50:17.960
MATT: I need you to make three

1368
00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:22.610
concentration checks as the bat...

1369
00:50:22.610 --> 00:50:24.896
Oh, and the bat's being held by...

1370
00:50:24.896 --> 00:50:26.730
LAURA: The bat's being held by me.
MATT: Correct.

1371
00:50:26.730 --> 00:50:28.740
LAURA: In my hood.
MATT: Yeah.

1372
00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:30.730
It's managed to break out.

1373
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:34.600
Every round it's trying to break free.

1374
00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:36.690
LAURA: And I haven't noticed it?

1375
00:50:36.690 --> 00:50:37.560
MATT: Well, here's what happens.

1376
00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:39.550
It breaks fee of the bag.

1377
00:50:39.550 --> 00:50:41.520
It was a natural 20.

1378
00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:43.710
Every six seconds it gets a try,

1379
00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:45.737
because all it wants to do right now is break free.

1380
00:50:45.737 --> 00:50:49.859
It manages to tear out. (fluttering)

1381
00:50:49.859 --> 00:50:52.665
(laughter)

1382
00:50:52.665 --> 00:50:55.880
So one concentration check as the first hit does get to you.

1383
00:50:55.880 --> 00:50:56.713
LAURA: Oh, god.

1384
00:50:56.713 --> 00:50:58.530
TALIESIN: I'm going to react to it, if that's okay.

1385
00:50:58.530 --> 00:50:59.610
LAURA: What did he roll?

1386
00:50:59.610 --> 00:51:01.210
What was it?
MATT: A natural 20.

1387
00:51:01.210 --> 00:51:03.260
LAURA: Oh, god, to hit me?
MATT: Yeah.

1388
00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:04.268
TALIESIN: Oh, I would have

1389
00:51:04.268 --> 00:51:05.930
canceled that natural 20 immediately.

1390
00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:07.010
MATT: Okay, it still hits you for a damage.

1391
00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:08.350
LAURA: Still hits, so I still got to--

1392
00:51:08.350 --> 00:51:09.200
LIAM: It's a concentration check.

1393
00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:10.262
MATT: It's fine.

1394
00:51:10.262 --> 00:51:11.095
You have to roll higher than a--

1395
00:51:11.095 --> 00:51:12.670
LAURA: It's cocked.

1396
00:51:12.670 --> 00:51:13.584
Fuck.

1397
00:51:13.584 --> 00:51:16.320
Plus my wisdom.
MARISHA: No, it can't be.

1398
00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:18.680
It can't do that much damage.
MATT: Constitution saving throw.

1399
00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:19.760
LAURA: Constitution saving throw.

1400
00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:20.770
Ten.
MATT: Ten?

1401
00:51:20.770 --> 00:51:21.710
That's fine.

1402
00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:22.720
You maintain concentration.

1403
00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:24.220
The bat is now escaping and starting

1404
00:51:24.220 --> 00:51:25.530
to try and bite at Jester.
TALIESIN: I'm going to go heck no.

1405
00:51:25.530 --> 00:51:28.390
I'm going to cast Bane on the bat, if that's okay.

1406
00:51:28.390 --> 00:51:31.693
MATT: Okay, the bat is Baned.

1407
00:51:31.693 --> 00:51:32.950
LAURA: So he's rolling lower--

1408
00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:34.510
TALIESIN: He's rolling lower in general.

1409
00:51:34.510 --> 00:51:36.120
He's got to take a d4 off of any attack.

1410
00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:37.550
He's not going to roll well.

1411
00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:39.770
MATT: 14?
LAURA: Mm-mm.

1412
00:51:39.770 --> 00:51:41.320
MATT: Do you do anything?

1413
00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:42.700
You're just going to let it keep attacking you?

1414
00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:44.930
LAURA: I guess I can try to put him, come on, man.

1415
00:51:44.930 --> 00:51:48.970
Get back in the cloak.
(laughter)

1416
00:51:48.970 --> 00:51:52.902
MATT: Make a strength check.
LAURA: A strength check.

1417
00:51:52.902 --> 00:51:54.916
MATT: Yeah.
LAURA: Oh no.

1418
00:51:54.916 --> 00:51:56.156
TALIESIN: Well, I mean...

1419
00:51:56.156 --> 00:51:59.020
LAURA: Five? What is it? Five?
MATT: Five?

1420
00:51:59.020 --> 00:51:59.853
You still beat it.

1421
00:51:59.853 --> 00:52:01.100
LAURA: Oh!
(laughter)

1422
00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:02.730
MATT: It's a bat and it rolled a four.

1423
00:52:02.730 --> 00:52:04.505
LAURA: Yay!

1424
00:52:04.505 --> 00:52:06.710
TALIESIN: And it gets a d4 against that as well.

1425
00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:08.333
MATT: That's true, yeah.

1426
00:52:08.333 --> 00:52:10.480
Yeah, one.

1427
00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:12.712
It escapes, gets one bite, you're like, "No."

1428
00:52:12.712 --> 00:52:14.010
It's back in the cloak.

1429
00:52:14.010 --> 00:52:15.770
LAURA: I hold it tighter.
TRAVIS: Yeah, time to go.

1430
00:52:15.770 --> 00:52:18.000
MATT: It's really angry.
MARISHA: I'm getting nervous.

1431
00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:19.560
Okay, I'm covered in bird shit.

1432
00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:21.230
I'm sorry.
MATT: You keep looking?

1433
00:52:21.230 --> 00:52:22.120
You have 30 more minutes.

1434
00:52:22.120 --> 00:52:23.920
It's up to you.

1435
00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:24.753
LIAM: (screeches)

1436
00:52:24.753 --> 00:52:28.222
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm disgusting.

1437
00:52:28.222 --> 00:52:29.971
MATT: You've only looked through about maybe

1438
00:52:29.971 --> 00:52:31.371
1/5th of the nest.

1439
00:52:31.371 --> 00:52:34.367
LAURA: He's tempting you.
MARISHA: And it's fucking working.

1440
00:52:34.367 --> 00:52:35.971
LAURA: He's really trying to...

1441
00:52:35.971 --> 00:52:39.609
You've got to take ten more-- one more look.

1442
00:52:39.609 --> 00:52:41.370
SAM: We've spent hours in this tree.

1443
00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:44.970
It's been hours.
MARISHA: You know what?

1444
00:52:44.970 --> 00:52:46.520
I saw a vardo...

1445
00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:49.810
Not the vardo, I saw a thing over there.

1446
00:52:49.810 --> 00:52:52.818
Looks interesting. Go over there! One more!

1447
00:52:52.818 --> 00:52:54.990
Ten more fucking minutes.
LIAM: (screeches)

1448
00:52:54.990 --> 00:52:55.965
MARISHA: We're going again.

1449
00:52:55.965 --> 00:52:56.850
MATT: All right, so we're at the 40-minute mark.

1450
00:52:56.850 --> 00:52:58.940
Go ahead and make an investigation check.

1451
00:52:58.940 --> 00:52:59.773
MARISHA: Okay, yeah.

1452
00:52:59.773 --> 00:53:00.920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1453
00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:03.906
I rolled better.
(squeals)

1454
00:53:03.906 --> 00:53:05.206
23!

1455
00:53:06.405 --> 00:53:07.247
MATT: 23?

1456
00:53:07.247 --> 00:53:08.582
MARISHA: I rolled a 17.

1457
00:53:08.582 --> 00:53:10.532
MATT: All right. How long does Bane last?

1458
00:53:10.532 --> 00:53:15.419
TALIESIN: Bane, that's a good question, lasts--

1459
00:53:15.419 --> 00:53:17.182
LAURA and TALIESIN: A minute.

1460
00:53:17.182 --> 00:53:21.263
MATT: All right, so how many spell slots do you have?

1461
00:53:21.263 --> 00:53:22.720
They just got another ten minutes now.

1462
00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:24.560
TALIESIN: Anytime he gets out, I'm going to hit it again.

1463
00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:25.420
MATT: Right, but he's not out yet.

1464
00:53:25.420 --> 00:53:27.004
He's still inside.

1465
00:53:27.004 --> 00:53:28.430
TALIESIN: It's a 1st-level spell.

1466
00:53:28.430 --> 00:53:29.312
I'll keep hitting it.

1467
00:53:29.312 --> 00:53:31.610
MATT: All right.

1468
00:53:31.610 --> 00:53:33.790
LAURA: He has to be within view, huh?

1469
00:53:33.790 --> 00:53:35.733
MATT: Yeah, okay. He does break out of the bag again.

1470
00:53:35.733 --> 00:53:38.456
(laughter)

1471
00:53:38.456 --> 00:53:39.675
TALIESIN: Knock it off!

1472
00:53:42.594 --> 00:53:43.900
MATT: Rolled a natural one.

1473
00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:46.410
It breaks free and immediately goes

1474
00:53:46.410 --> 00:53:47.720
to attack you and gets stuck halfway

1475
00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:50.046
in the cloak that it just escaped from.

1476
00:53:50.046 --> 00:53:51.540
LAURA: Okay. (laughs)
MATT: You wrap it up again.

1477
00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:52.925
LAURA: I just put it back over him.

1478
00:53:52.925 --> 00:53:54.290
MATT: (laughs) Make a strength check.

1479
00:53:54.290 --> 00:53:56.050
LAURA: I hold him and I try to pet him

1480
00:53:56.050 --> 00:53:59.103
as he's in the cloak like: Calm down, bud.

1481
00:53:59.103 --> 00:54:01.232
MATT: All right, you have to beat an eight.

1482
00:54:01.232 --> 00:54:03.058
TALIESIN: An eight with the negative four?

1483
00:54:03.058 --> 00:54:03.891
MATT: With the negative.

1484
00:54:03.891 --> 00:54:04.846
Well, negative d3.

1485
00:54:04.846 --> 00:54:05.679
I rolled a three.
LAURA: Oh no!

1486
00:54:05.679 --> 00:54:06.888
I rolled a one!

1487
00:54:06.888 --> 00:54:08.780
MATT: All right, so he's going to attack you again.

1488
00:54:10.270 --> 00:54:12.558
TALIESIN: Negative four.
MATT: Negative d4.

1489
00:54:12.558 --> 00:54:13.800
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: So 16.

1490
00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:14.930
What's your armor class?
LAURA: 18!

1491
00:54:14.930 --> 00:54:16.866
MATT: Yeah, it's fine.
(laughs)

1492
00:54:16.866 --> 00:54:18.820
This bat is really--

1493
00:54:18.820 --> 00:54:19.850
LAURA: I just keep trying to put him back in.

1494
00:54:19.850 --> 00:54:20.683
MATT: Yeah, roll another strength check.

1495
00:54:20.683 --> 00:54:21.750
LAURA: Calm down, calm down.

1496
00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:23.590
LIAM: This mighty bird is confused.

1497
00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:27.400
LAURA: Yeah, that was good.
MATT: Okay, you capture him.

1498
00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:28.430
He rolled a six.

1499
00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:29.263
All right, so--
MARISHA: 23.

1500
00:54:29.263 --> 00:54:30.096
MATT: 23.

1501
00:54:30.096 --> 00:54:31.010
In this time period...

1502
00:54:31.010 --> 00:54:34.429
This is fun to play this out.
(laughter)

1503
00:54:34.429 --> 00:54:36.210
LIAM: Imagine that you're Rodan

1504
00:54:36.210 --> 00:54:38.090
and this shit happened to you.

1505
00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:41.710
MATT: You come over and you go to the cart,

1506
00:54:41.710 --> 00:54:42.980
but the cart is empty and broken,

1507
00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:44.540
but you see wheels pushed

1508
00:54:44.540 --> 00:54:46.830
and broken and woven into large logs

1509
00:54:46.830 --> 00:54:48.490
and pieces of lumber that were used

1510
00:54:48.490 --> 00:54:50.220
for construction that are snapped halfway

1511
00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:51.788
through the large bars,

1512
00:54:51.788 --> 00:54:56.010
and there are lots of suits of empty armor,

1513
00:54:56.010 --> 00:55:00.130
very bloody suits of armor that have been torn open.

1514
00:55:00.130 --> 00:55:02.090
The metal is, like, bent backward.

1515
00:55:02.090 --> 00:55:04.230
You can see where the beak tore through.

1516
00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:05.220
It's like eating a lobster.

1517
00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:06.842
You just got to get through the shell.

1518
00:55:06.842 --> 00:55:09.250
You find all this armor

1519
00:55:09.250 --> 00:55:12.060
with bits of long, decaying dark matter

1520
00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:14.673
that's just been left on the inside.

1521
00:55:14.673 --> 00:55:15.860
There's flies everywhere.

1522
00:55:15.860 --> 00:55:17.663
It's a terrible smell.

1523
00:55:17.663 --> 00:55:19.648
But you start rummaging through some

1524
00:55:19.648 --> 00:55:22.450
of these pouches and stuff and you find

1525
00:55:24.330 --> 00:55:26.625
a lot of really nice jewelry.

1526
00:55:28.690 --> 00:55:32.440
You find two gold rings and one

1527
00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:34.590
pearl-set necklace.

1528
00:55:34.590 --> 00:55:39.444
Probably, you think, they're worth a fair amount.

1529
00:55:39.444 --> 00:55:41.910
As well as an additional 40 gold pieces.

1530
00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:46.449
SAM: Hey!
TRAVIS: Two gold rings, huh?

1531
00:55:46.449 --> 00:55:49.195
TALIESIN: ♪ Two golden rings ♪

1532
00:55:49.195 --> 00:55:51.414
LIAM: (screeches)

1533
00:55:51.414 --> 00:55:54.090
MATT: Breaks free again.
SAM: Breaks free again!

1534
00:55:54.090 --> 00:55:56.860
TALIESIN: Is it in the first minute?

1535
00:55:56.860 --> 00:55:58.220
Was it further down or?

1536
00:55:58.220 --> 00:56:00.094
MATT: No, this is after that Bane of yours.

1537
00:56:00.094 --> 00:56:02.474
(laughs)

1538
00:56:02.474 --> 00:56:05.600
You cast Bane again.
TALIESIN: Casting Bane again.

1539
00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:06.870
MATT: Did you mark your spell slots?

1540
00:56:06.870 --> 00:56:09.366
TALIESIN: I am.
MATT: That's 11.

1541
00:56:09.366 --> 00:56:10.710
It misses you.

1542
00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:11.960
You going to try and capture it again?

1543
00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:13.672
LAURA: Sure.
MATT: Strength check!

1544
00:56:13.672 --> 00:56:15.711
(laughs)

1545
00:56:16.778 --> 00:56:19.570
LAURA: Yeah, nine.
MATT: Nine, no.

1546
00:56:19.570 --> 00:56:20.825
You don't manage to capture it.

1547
00:56:20.825 --> 00:56:22.240
(whooshing) It gets away.

1548
00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:23.592
It's super on-ball!

1549
00:56:23.592 --> 00:56:26.340
Natural one, minus one, zero!

1550
00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:29.056
It does not hit you.
(laughter)

1551
00:56:29.056 --> 00:56:30.443
LAURA: Ha!

1552
00:56:30.443 --> 00:56:31.771
(mic thumps)
Oh, shit!

1553
00:56:31.771 --> 00:56:33.120
(laughter)

1554
00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:34.044
MATT: Sorry, guys.

1555
00:56:34.044 --> 00:56:36.220
TALIESIN: I can't even imagine what that sounded like.

1556
00:56:36.220 --> 00:56:38.336
LAURA: I know. (laughs)

1557
00:56:38.336 --> 00:56:41.510
Ooh, okay, 16.

1558
00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:42.343
MATT: Yeah, it's back in the cloak.

1559
00:56:42.343 --> 00:56:43.612
LAURA: Okay. (laughs)

1560
00:56:43.612 --> 00:56:45.000
Hurry up, you guys!

1561
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:45.833
Thaumaturgy.

1562
00:56:45.833 --> 00:56:47.510
Hurry up, you guys!
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

1563
00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:48.343
I'm satisfied.

1564
00:56:48.343 --> 00:56:50.160
Let's go.
LAURA: Sorry about the microphone.

1565
00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:51.550
MATT: This is amazing.

1566
00:56:51.550 --> 00:56:53.983
MARISHA: I jump back.
MATT: You jump back on the back.

1567
00:56:53.983 --> 00:56:55.650
The baby at this point is slowly making

1568
00:56:55.650 --> 00:56:57.250
its way over towards you this whole time,

1569
00:56:57.250 --> 00:56:59.455
and it's been simultaneously

1570
00:56:59.455 --> 00:57:02.640
expectant for food against the eagle.

1571
00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:04.270
Do you snap at it?

1572
00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:06.240
MARISHA: No, don't pick fights.

1573
00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:09.003
LIAM: Not in its face, but--
MATT: No, but it goes for you.

1574
00:57:09.003 --> 00:57:10.869
14 to hit.

1575
00:57:10.869 --> 00:57:12.960
LIAM: On my bird? I think that hits, yeah.

1576
00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:13.793
It was 13.

1577
00:57:13.793 --> 00:57:15.580
MATT: All right, that's 11 points piercing damage.

1578
00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:18.000
LIAM: Ooh, good!

1579
00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.696
SAM: Are you still up?
LAURA: Run the fuck away!

1580
00:57:20.696 --> 00:57:23.404
LIAM: (squawking)

1581
00:57:23.404 --> 00:57:26.715
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: Back it up.

1582
00:57:26.715 --> 00:57:28.480
MATT: Okay, with Beau on its back,

1583
00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:29.850
it gets an attack of opportunity on you

1584
00:57:29.850 --> 00:57:31.480
as you back out of its combat range.

1585
00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:33.743
LIAM: I said I wasn't going to-- oh god.

1586
00:57:33.743 --> 00:57:34.576
MARISHA: Is it attacking me?

1587
00:57:34.576 --> 00:57:37.999
Can I do something to--
MATT: It's attacking him,

1588
00:57:37.999 --> 00:57:39.442
which means you can if you want to.

1589
00:57:39.442 --> 00:57:41.930
MARISHA: Can I Sentinel it?
MATT: Yeah, go for it.

1590
00:57:41.930 --> 00:57:44.160
TRAVIS: Are you within melee of it?
MARISHA: Oh, I feel so mean.

1591
00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:46.310
TRAVIS: Are you right next to him?
LIAM: You better do that.

1592
00:57:46.310 --> 00:57:47.960
MARISHA: I'm on him.

1593
00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:50.190
Okay, 22 for me.

1594
00:57:50.190 --> 00:57:51.948
MATT: That's a hit. Roll damage.

1595
00:57:51.948 --> 00:57:54.858
TRAVIS: Stun that fucking bird.

1596
00:57:55.950 --> 00:57:56.870
MARISHA: Yeah, I guess I could do that.

1597
00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:58.948
MATT: That's a natural 20 against you.

1598
00:57:58.948 --> 00:58:00.350
(gasps)
LIAM: Oh, just now?

1599
00:58:00.350 --> 00:58:01.640
MATT: Yeah, when it was trying to snap at you.

1600
00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:03.320
LIAM: Oh, I'm sure that hits, right?

1601
00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:05.000
MATT: This dice has been rolling really well tonight.

1602
00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:08.438
LIAM: Mm, great.
MARISHA: Oh my god.

1603
00:58:08.438 --> 00:58:10.000
MATT: 14 points of piercing damage.

1604
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:11.474
LIAM: I am a wizard.

1605
00:58:11.474 --> 00:58:13.993
(laughter)

1606
00:58:13.993 --> 00:58:15.230
MARISHA: Am I on your back?

1607
00:58:15.230 --> 00:58:16.660
LAURA: But you guys have Feather Fall still.

1608
00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:17.493
MARISHA: He does.

1609
00:58:17.493 --> 00:58:20.840
MATT: You crack it in the head.

1610
00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:21.690
Roll your damage.

1611
00:58:21.690 --> 00:58:24.182
MARISHA: 11 damage.

1612
00:58:24.182 --> 00:58:25.960
MATT: (squawks) It pulls back.
MARISHA: I'm sorry!

1613
00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:27.940
MATT: It's just a horrible, sad noise

1614
00:58:27.940 --> 00:58:29.365
when you crack it in the face.

1615
00:58:29.365 --> 00:58:31.080
MARISHA: You made me fucking hit a bird!

1616
00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:31.913
LIAM: Am I--

1617
00:58:31.913 --> 00:58:33.787
TRAVIS: A 12-foot bird. Let's not forget about that.

1618
00:58:33.787 --> 00:58:34.840
LIAM: Get to the edge of the nest, please?

1619
00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:36.780
MATT: You're, like, standing on Caleb's shoulders

1620
00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:39.511
as he transforms back into himself.

1621
00:58:39.511 --> 00:58:40.723
MARISHA: Let's go! Let's run!

1622
00:58:41.585 --> 00:58:43.500
LIAM: Like a piggyback ride.
MARISHA: Yeah.

1623
00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:45.051
LIAM: I'm backing up and I'm pulling.

1624
00:58:45.051 --> 00:58:47.120
I have a 5th-spell slot left,

1625
00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:48.510
and I'm pulling out the cocoon again.

1626
00:58:48.510 --> 00:58:50.242
Come on, we've got to get out of here!

1627
00:58:50.242 --> 00:58:52.355
(screeches)

1628
00:58:52.355 --> 00:58:54.642
MATT: One last final eagle call

1629
00:58:54.642 --> 00:58:56.432
as you leap over the side of the nest

1630
00:58:56.432 --> 00:58:59.080
from branch to branch out of the canopy.

1631
00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:00.580
You're pushing 45 minutes now.

1632
00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:02.900
50 minutes, dive down.

1633
00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:05.233
SAM: They're coming, they're coming! Let's go!

1634
00:59:05.233 --> 00:59:07.350
MATT: With a little over ten minutes left of the spell.

1635
00:59:07.350 --> 00:59:08.570
LAURA: Oh my god.

1636
00:59:08.570 --> 00:59:10.645
Just a little over ten minutes left?

1637
00:59:10.645 --> 00:59:12.286
Holy shit!

1638
00:59:12.286 --> 00:59:13.553
I thought we had 20 minutes left!

1639
00:59:13.553 --> 00:59:14.818
TALIESIN: Yeah, I thought we had 20 minutes left.

1640
00:59:14.818 --> 00:59:15.651
LAURA: Yeah, we had 20 minutes left,

1641
00:59:15.651 --> 00:59:17.160
ten minutes on the search.

1642
00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:19.490
We should have 20 minutes.

1643
00:59:19.490 --> 00:59:20.620
MATT: It was 40 minutes for the search,

1644
00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:22.230
and then it was them biting and then having to get out,

1645
00:59:22.230 --> 00:59:23.590
and then recast and get back out to you guys.

1646
00:59:23.590 --> 00:59:24.560
45 minutes.

1647
00:59:24.560 --> 00:59:25.393
SAM: That's fine.

1648
00:59:25.393 --> 00:59:27.059
MATT: To fly back down and get to you.

1649
00:59:27.059 --> 00:59:28.453
SAM: All we need is three minutes.

1650
00:59:28.453 --> 00:59:29.286
MATT: I've been very kind

1651
00:59:29.286 --> 00:59:30.377
in some of the allowances I've done here.

1652
00:59:30.377 --> 00:59:32.560
LAURA: After they come down, I'm going to...

1653
00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:35.625
Let me double check this is not a...

1654
00:59:35.625 --> 00:59:38.080
SAM: I'm going to mount...

1655
00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:40.030
What is it? What's your moorbounder's name?

1656
00:59:40.030 --> 00:59:41.080
LIAM: Jannik.
SAM: Jannik,

1657
00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:42.835
because Caleb can't command it,

1658
00:59:42.835 --> 00:59:45.490
so I will take the helm of Jannik.

1659
00:59:45.490 --> 00:59:46.620
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: Good luck.

1660
00:59:46.620 --> 00:59:48.640
MATT: Make an animal handling check.

1661
00:59:50.243 --> 00:59:51.459
SAM: Two.

1662
00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:55.825
LIAM: Jannik eats Nott.
MARISHA: Yeah.

1663
00:59:55.825 --> 00:59:59.350
MATT: (snorting) And just flings you off backwards.

1664
00:59:59.350 --> 01:00:02.150
You go flying 20 feet onto your back.

1665
01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:03.310
SAM: Yasha, can you try?
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah.

1666
01:00:03.310 --> 01:00:04.143
I'll give it a try.

1667
01:00:04.143 --> 01:00:05.190
MATT: Take three points of bludgeoning damage.

1668
01:00:05.190 --> 01:00:07.220
ASHLEY: I'll get off the one with Caleb

1669
01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:09.110
and I'll try to get onto Jannik.

1670
01:00:09.110 --> 01:00:10.000
MATT: Make an animal handling check.

1671
01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.950
SAM: You know what, Yasha? Use a German accent.

1672
01:00:11.950 --> 01:00:13.490
I mean a Zemnian accent.

1673
01:00:13.490 --> 01:00:14.323
They like that.

1674
01:00:14.323 --> 01:00:15.800
MATT: The bat tears free of the cloak.

1675
01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:17.128
This cloak now has multiple holes in it.

1676
01:00:17.128 --> 01:00:18.513
It's (fluttering).

1677
01:00:18.513 --> 01:00:20.161
TALIESIN: Bane.

1678
01:00:20.161 --> 01:00:21.569
MATT: Bane again. Mark that off.

1679
01:00:21.569 --> 01:00:23.072
SAM: What'd you roll?
ASHLEY: I rolled a three.

1680
01:00:23.072 --> 01:00:24.421
(laughter)

1681
01:00:24.421 --> 01:00:25.690
Fuck!
LIAM: (screeches)

1682
01:00:25.690 --> 01:00:27.370
MATT: Jannik actually bites at you.

1683
01:00:27.370 --> 01:00:29.090
It doesn't see you coming.

1684
01:00:29.090 --> 01:00:30.640
As you attempt to walk towards it,

1685
01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:32.902
(barks) instinctually goes and--

1686
01:00:32.902 --> 01:00:34.830
ASHLEY: It's not going to work for me either!

1687
01:00:34.830 --> 01:00:35.870
MATT: That's a natural one, though.

1688
01:00:35.870 --> 01:00:38.027
You manage to step and catch its snout.

1689
01:00:38.027 --> 01:00:40.071
ASHLEY: No!

1690
01:00:40.071 --> 01:00:42.660
MATT: It actually gains a little respect

1691
01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:44.020
for you after you catch its snout.

1692
01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:47.839
SAM: I will cast Phantasmal Force on the moorbounder.

1693
01:00:47.839 --> 01:00:49.670
MATT: Okay.

1694
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:53.460
SAM: If it fails...

1695
01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:56.586
MATT: It can't beat your armor class.

1696
01:00:56.586 --> 01:00:58.760
It's just (clunking).

1697
01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:00.980
LAURA: Hey, I'm not going to fight back.

1698
01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:01.920
Just keep attacking me.

1699
01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:03.770
SAM: It has to beat a DC 15.

1700
01:01:03.770 --> 01:01:05.440
LAURA: By the way, is he still...

1701
01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:07.010
Oh, no.
MATT: Natural 16.

1702
01:01:07.010 --> 01:01:08.213
TALIESIN: Minus?

1703
01:01:08.213 --> 01:01:09.054
LAURA: This whole time

1704
01:01:09.054 --> 01:01:11.630
he's been attacking me in a leaf costume.

1705
01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:13.520
MARISHA: Yeah, you're still in the leaf costume. (laughs)

1706
01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:16.896
SAM: There's no minuses or pluses for the moorbounder?

1707
01:01:16.896 --> 01:01:18.177
MATT: I'm looking it up right now.

1708
01:01:18.177 --> 01:01:19.688
SAM: You're still in the leaf costume?

1709
01:01:19.688 --> 01:01:22.730
MATT: Yep, this whole time.
(laughs)

1710
01:01:22.730 --> 01:01:25.010
Yeah, it resists the Phantasmal Force.

1711
01:01:25.010 --> 01:01:27.618
I'm sorry. It rolled natural 16.

1712
01:01:27.618 --> 01:01:29.710
MARISHA: Are we down yet?

1713
01:01:29.710 --> 01:01:33.723
MATT: The bat can't get a hit in. It's trying.

1714
01:01:33.723 --> 01:01:34.939
You guys have come down. You're down.

1715
01:01:34.939 --> 01:01:35.772
You've joined the rest of the group

1716
01:01:35.772 --> 01:01:37.055
as this is all happening.

1717
01:01:37.055 --> 01:01:39.070
LAURA: I'm going to cast Command on it.

1718
01:01:39.070 --> 01:01:39.903
MATT: It cannot hit you.

1719
01:01:39.903 --> 01:01:41.160
LAURA: I'm going to cast Command on the bat

1720
01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:44.191
and tell it to go home.
MATT: Okay.

1721
01:01:44.191 --> 01:01:46.440
How long does Command last?

1722
01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:47.580
For one round?
LAURA: For one round.

1723
01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:50.339
MATT: It moves away for a round and comes right back.

1724
01:01:50.339 --> 01:01:53.519
(laughter)

1725
01:01:53.519 --> 01:01:56.044
SAM: We can't drive your car without your keys.

1726
01:01:56.044 --> 01:01:56.951
Come on back!

1727
01:01:56.951 --> 01:01:59.569
MATT: Yeah, it just (clunking).

1728
01:01:59.569 --> 01:02:01.300
SAM: Oh, are you not an eagle anymore?

1729
01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:03.240
LIAM: Yeah, I just--
SAM: Oh, thank god.

1730
01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:05.170
LAURA: We get on the moorbounders and we start to go.

1731
01:02:05.170 --> 01:02:06.160
MATT: Okay, you get on your moorbounders

1732
01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:09.940
and you just cruise away northward, full speed.

1733
01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:11.750
You got about, I'll say, ten minutes

1734
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:13.900
to travel here after all the faffing

1735
01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:15.670
and gathering your things and spell casting.

1736
01:02:15.670 --> 01:02:17.250
The bat is left behind.

1737
01:02:17.250 --> 01:02:18.300
It cannot catch up.

1738
01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:20.090
LIAM: Oh, he can't fly fast enough to catch up?

1739
01:02:20.090 --> 01:02:22.706
MATT: Oh god no. The bat? By no means can it.

1740
01:02:22.706 --> 01:02:24.490
TRAVIS: Yeah, but he's going to change back in a second.

1741
01:02:24.490 --> 01:02:25.540
LAURA: He's going to change back real soon.

1742
01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:27.940
ASHLEY: We got to go.
LAURA: And he's pissed at us!

1743
01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:29.560
MATT: Oh yeah. (laughs)

1744
01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:32.925
MARISHA: Ten minutes, go!
LAURA: Go, go, go, go, go.

1745
01:02:32.925 --> 01:02:34.244
MATT: You go full sprint.

1746
01:02:34.244 --> 01:02:36.560
TALIESIN: We're looking for anywhere for cover, by the way.

1747
01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:37.510
MATT: Perception check.

1748
01:02:38.731 --> 01:02:41.600
TRAVIS: Fuck.
SAM: We spent so many spells.

1749
01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:44.800
LAURA: But hey, we did it!

1750
01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:47.010
TALIESIN: 22.

1751
01:02:47.010 --> 01:02:48.823
MATT: As you all are rushing up forward,

1752
01:02:48.823 --> 01:02:51.920
about nine minutes of that ten crest

1753
01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:53.730
before out of your sight,

1754
01:02:53.730 --> 01:02:55.845
you catch a rock formation.

1755
01:02:55.845 --> 01:02:59.230
It's a small protrusion that curves over

1756
01:02:59.230 --> 01:03:01.610
and creates like a small hole to pass through.

1757
01:03:01.610 --> 01:03:04.740
It's like a little mesa with a tunnel in the middle.

1758
01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:05.573
It's very small.

1759
01:03:05.573 --> 01:03:06.450
TALIESIN: We're going to take cover.

1760
01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:08.140
I'm going to pull everyone. Take cover, take cover!

1761
01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:09.740
MATT: You guys go ahead and take Caduceus' lead.

1762
01:03:09.740 --> 01:03:12.450
You move over and you all cruise underneath.

1763
01:03:12.450 --> 01:03:14.710
There's maybe about 20 feet of tunnel here

1764
01:03:14.710 --> 01:03:16.529
that is shielded from the sun,

1765
01:03:16.529 --> 01:03:18.680
which now the clouds have begun to break.

1766
01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:20.030
The rains that came in previously

1767
01:03:20.030 --> 01:03:21.500
are starting to separate a bit,

1768
01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:23.650
and a little light's peaking through.

1769
01:03:23.650 --> 01:03:25.450
The ground's still muddy and you're still rushing there.

1770
01:03:25.450 --> 01:03:26.410
You're still kicking up and leaving

1771
01:03:26.410 --> 01:03:28.580
this big trail of muck behind you.

1772
01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:30.578
You all make your way into this little tunnel

1773
01:03:30.578 --> 01:03:35.570
right as you hear (screeches).

1774
01:03:36.460 --> 01:03:38.100
LAURA: Pass Without a Trace on all of us.

1775
01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:39.362
MATT: All right, everyone make stealth checks.

1776
01:03:39.362 --> 01:03:42.190
MARISHA: Oh, boy.

1777
01:03:44.130 --> 01:03:47.188
MATT: Advantage on wisdom perception checks

1778
01:03:47.188 --> 01:03:49.238
that rely on sight.

1779
01:03:50.990 --> 01:03:52.067
Okay, what'd you all get?

1780
01:03:52.067 --> 01:03:54.080
TRAVIS: 25.
MARISHA: 26.

1781
01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:55.650
LIAM: 26.
SAM: 25.

1782
01:03:55.650 --> 01:03:57.110
LAURA: 29.
TALIESIN: 15.

1783
01:03:57.110 --> 01:03:59.300
ASHLEY: One.
(groaning)

1784
01:03:59.300 --> 01:04:01.238
TALIESIN: Natural one or--
ASHLEY: A natural one.

1785
01:04:01.238 --> 01:04:05.330
LAURA: Plus ten.
ASHLEY: 11.

1786
01:04:05.330 --> 01:04:06.436
SAM: Wait, we get plus ten?

1787
01:04:06.436 --> 01:04:08.600
MATT: Plus ten from--
SAM: 35.

1788
01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:09.680
MATT: There you go.

1789
01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:10.940
LIAM: It might not be in time,

1790
01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:12.970
but Caleb pulls out his book and starts

1791
01:04:12.970 --> 01:04:15.340
to ritual cast Leomund's Tiny Hut

1792
01:04:15.340 --> 01:04:17.690
to make a cork in the end of this tunnel.

1793
01:04:17.690 --> 01:04:18.540
There might not be enough time,

1794
01:04:18.540 --> 01:04:20.010
but he's doing it anyway.
MATT: Won't be enough time.

1795
01:04:20.010 --> 01:04:21.460
LIAM: Okay, well he doesn't know that, so he's doing it.

1796
01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:23.650
MATT: Right, so you begin doing that. Okay.

1797
01:04:23.650 --> 01:04:26.093
SAM: Yasha, your butt is sticking out. Your butt!

1798
01:04:26.093 --> 01:04:29.696
LAURA: I'm going to prep a spell for as soon as...

1799
01:04:29.696 --> 01:04:32.118
SAM: No!

1800
01:04:32.118 --> 01:04:35.076
LAURA: As soon as he's within-- oh god, it's close--

1801
01:04:35.076 --> 01:04:36.684
30 feet of me.

1802
01:04:36.684 --> 01:04:37.780
MATT: Okay.

1803
01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:39.300
You're all sitting in this thing's shadow.

1804
01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:41.840
You can see that there's the circular exit

1805
01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:44.110
that goes out into the little bit of sunlight,

1806
01:04:44.110 --> 01:04:47.100
and overcast exterior.

1807
01:04:48.428 --> 01:04:50.450
You can see the pools of rainwater

1808
01:04:50.450 --> 01:04:52.430
that are still visible across the muck on the outside,

1809
01:04:52.430 --> 01:04:54.430
and you can see where there's barbs rising.

1810
01:04:54.430 --> 01:04:56.570
TALIESIN: Has it noticed us?
MATT: You don't know yet.

1811
01:04:56.570 --> 01:04:58.640
You guys are up in the inside shadow right now.

1812
01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:01.450
You're all ten feet back and all you can see

1813
01:05:01.450 --> 01:05:03.950
is the exit and what little bit of view

1814
01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:05.890
you have from the portal that leads outward.

1815
01:05:05.890 --> 01:05:07.120
The moorbounders are getting restless

1816
01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:07.953
and (growling).

1817
01:05:07.953 --> 01:05:09.240
TRAVIS: How big is that portal again?

1818
01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:11.288
You said it's--
MATT: Well, the whole structure

1819
01:05:11.288 --> 01:05:14.770
is maybe about 50 feet long, end-to-end,

1820
01:05:14.770 --> 01:05:17.080
the portal's about 20 feet, 15 feet wide in certain places.

1821
01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:18.637
You're all crammed in there with the moorbounders,

1822
01:05:18.637 --> 01:05:20.930
just (shushes) trying to be quiet.

1823
01:05:20.930 --> 01:05:25.482
You hear (wings flapping).

1824
01:05:25.482 --> 01:05:28.570
(screeches)

1825
01:05:28.570 --> 01:05:31.237
(wings flapping)

1826
01:05:34.992 --> 01:05:37.808
(wings flapping closer)

1827
01:05:38.668 --> 01:05:40.676
(screeches)
SAM: Oh, god!

1828
01:05:40.676 --> 01:05:45.676
(laughter and shushing)

1829
01:05:45.749 --> 01:05:47.166
That was in-game.

1830
01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:49.950
TALIESIN: 35 minus.

1831
01:05:49.950 --> 01:05:52.450
(wings flapping)

1832
01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:03.787
Then it passes. No sound.

1833
01:06:05.548 --> 01:06:08.590
LAURA: You're still working--
TRAVIS: Stop it!

1834
01:06:08.590 --> 01:06:10.440
LIAM: It takes ten minutes.
MATT: Ten minutes,

1835
01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:12.585
so you're still working on it.

1836
01:06:12.585 --> 01:06:14.165
Five minutes go by.

1837
01:06:16.153 --> 01:06:20.747
(wings flapping)
MARISHA: Fuck.

1838
01:06:20.747 --> 01:06:22.180
MARISHA: (shushing)
SAM: I'm just drinking.

1839
01:06:24.213 --> 01:06:26.880
(wings flapping)

1840
01:06:28.398 --> 01:06:30.731
(screeches)

1841
01:06:34.143 --> 01:06:36.429
We're probably okay, right?

1842
01:06:36.429 --> 01:06:37.730
MATT: Seven minutes.

1843
01:06:39.837 --> 01:06:43.161
Eight minutes go by.
SAM: I've been drinking a lot.

1844
01:06:43.161 --> 01:06:45.958
MATT: Nine minutes go by.

1845
01:06:45.958 --> 01:06:48.940
You complete your hut.
(sighing)

1846
01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:50.890
Now the hole is (clunking).

1847
01:06:51.950 --> 01:06:54.690
LIAM: Caleb just lays down on the ground in the mud.

1848
01:06:54.690 --> 01:06:56.650
SAM: Guys!
TRAVIS: Nice job.

1849
01:06:56.650 --> 01:06:58.908
SAM: That was awesome.

1850
01:07:00.591 --> 01:07:01.700
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

1851
01:07:01.700 --> 01:07:03.230
SAM: What'd you find up there, Beau?

1852
01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:05.340
Something that was well worth it?

1853
01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:06.600
MARISHA: I hope so.

1854
01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:08.311
I start pulling out all the loot,

1855
01:07:08.311 --> 01:07:12.177
including my giant roc feather.

1856
01:07:12.177 --> 01:07:15.041
LAURA: That thing is huge, Beau.

1857
01:07:15.041 --> 01:07:18.199
TALIESIN: I'm going to keep

1858
01:07:18.199 --> 01:07:20.415
an eye out while all this is happening.

1859
01:07:20.415 --> 01:07:22.650
I'm just going to sit at the entryway

1860
01:07:22.650 --> 01:07:24.130
and just keep an eye out on things.

1861
01:07:24.130 --> 01:07:26.197
MATT: Okay, cool.
TALIESIN: For a while.

1862
01:07:27.155 --> 01:07:29.430
ASHLEY: What's all there? Let's see.

1863
01:07:29.430 --> 01:07:30.680
LAURA: What did you get, Beau?

1864
01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:33.310
MARISHA: Okay, I got 250 gold pieces.

1865
01:07:33.310 --> 01:07:35.923
I got these silk robes and clothes.

1866
01:07:35.923 --> 01:07:38.220
They seem fancy.
LAURA: Ooh, what are they?

1867
01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:40.900
MATT: They're Rosohna make.

1868
01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:43.060
They are just nice, noble clothing,

1869
01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:45.910
silks and high tread count.
LAURA: I put them on.

1870
01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:48.230
MARISHA: They might be a little smelly.

1871
01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:50.483
LAURA: I don't care.
SAM: Because they're free robes?

1872
01:07:50.483 --> 01:07:52.013
MARISHA: It's covered by bird shit and dead people.

1873
01:07:52.013 --> 01:07:55.560
There's also these necklaces.
LAURA: They were folded.

1874
01:07:57.444 --> 01:07:59.608
MARISHA: A necklace, some rings.

1875
01:07:59.608 --> 01:08:00.441
And then--

1876
01:08:00.441 --> 01:08:02.550
LIAM: Yeah, what about that lockbox?

1877
01:08:03.872 --> 01:08:04.890
TRAVIS: Are they just normal rings?

1878
01:08:04.890 --> 01:08:07.438
MARISHA: Toss it to Nott.

1879
01:08:07.438 --> 01:08:08.510
SAM: (growling)

1880
01:08:08.510 --> 01:08:11.382
MARISHA: No! It's iron.

1881
01:08:11.382 --> 01:08:14.408
Careful, you might want to check it for traps.

1882
01:08:14.408 --> 01:08:16.540
MATT: Okay, so make a lock picking check.

1883
01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:18.830
LAURA: I take one of the silk robes off and put it on Yasha.

1884
01:08:18.830 --> 01:08:19.663
MATT: Okay.

1885
01:08:19.663 --> 01:08:21.910
SAM and MATT: 22 to open.

1886
01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:23.340
LAURA: It's so pretty.
MATT: (lock clicking)

1887
01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:25.960
It opens up!
SAM: (squeaking chest)

1888
01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:27.185
MATT: Make a dexterity saving throw.

1889
01:08:27.185 --> 01:08:28.826
LAURA: Oh, no!

1890
01:08:28.826 --> 01:08:29.659
LIAM: Ya dunce.

1891
01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:33.630
SAM: 15.
MATT: 15, okay.

1892
01:08:33.630 --> 01:08:35.310
Everyone else in there, also make a dexterity saving throw.

1893
01:08:35.310 --> 01:08:36.896
TRAVIS: Shit.
LAURA: Fuck.

1894
01:08:36.896 --> 01:08:39.000
MATT: As you open it up and you see,

1895
01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.490
first you see a nice little pillow

1896
01:08:40.490 --> 01:08:43.445
that has this beautiful, gold ring

1897
01:08:43.445 --> 01:08:45.520
with a little opal set into it.

1898
01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:46.720
You're like oh, pretty.

1899
01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:49.857
This light little light goes (explosion).

1900
01:08:50.824 --> 01:08:52.635
The chamber is fireballed.

1901
01:08:52.635 --> 01:08:54.485
There was a fireball trap in there.

1902
01:08:56.140 --> 01:08:58.860
TALIESIN: We may be really bad.

1903
01:08:58.860 --> 01:09:00.990
SAM: Do you know have any healing spells left?

1904
01:09:00.990 --> 01:09:02.310
LAURA: We might all be unconscious.

1905
01:09:02.310 --> 01:09:04.220
ASHLEY: That's so many that he's rolling!

1906
01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:05.920
MATT: Okay, hold on.

1907
01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:07.195
SAM: Fireball's not too bad.

1908
01:09:07.195 --> 01:09:10.637
LIAM: It's like 20 to 30.
MARISHA: Yeah.

1909
01:09:10.637 --> 01:09:12.636
MATT: All right, so what'd you roll?

1910
01:09:12.636 --> 01:09:15.070
TRAVIS: A 11.

1911
01:09:15.070 --> 01:09:17.040
MATT: 24 points of fire damage.

1912
01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:17.910
TALIESIN: Fine-ish.

1913
01:09:17.910 --> 01:09:20.522
MARISHA: Natural one.
MATT: 24 points of fire damage.

1914
01:09:20.522 --> 01:09:22.490
LIAM: 21 with the ring of evasion.

1915
01:09:22.490 --> 01:09:24.320
MATT: Okay, so you take 12 points of fire damage.

1916
01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:25.430
SAM: 15.

1917
01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:26.920
MATT: You take 12 points of fire damage.

1918
01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:28.510
LAURA: 20.
SAM: I will lessen that to zero.

1919
01:09:28.510 --> 01:09:29.450
MATT: 12 points of fire damage.

1920
01:09:29.450 --> 01:09:30.283
Zero.

1921
01:09:30.283 --> 01:09:32.604
TALIESIN: 17.
MATT: 17, all right.

1922
01:09:32.604 --> 01:09:34.220
TALIESIN: That's 12 points fire damage?

1923
01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:35.190
MATT: Yeah. 12 points of fire damage.

1924
01:09:35.190 --> 01:09:36.800
ASHLEY: 18.
MATT: 12 points of fire damage.

1925
01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:38.360
Now Marisha, you have Evasion,

1926
01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:40.250
so even on a failure, I think

1927
01:09:40.250 --> 01:09:41.490
you still take half damage.

1928
01:09:41.490 --> 01:09:42.960
MARISHA: Oh, I thought it was on a...

1929
01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:44.743
Oh, okay. Yeah, you're right.

1930
01:09:44.743 --> 01:09:47.370
Success no damage, failure half damage.

1931
01:09:47.370 --> 01:09:49.100
You're right.

1932
01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:51.127
ASHLEY: Now we can see what's in it.

1933
01:09:51.127 --> 01:09:53.560
MATT: After the ringing in your ears fades,

1934
01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:55.987
the inside of the rock is slightly singed.

1935
01:09:55.987 --> 01:09:58.270
SAM: Sorry, guys. Sorry

1936
01:09:58.270 --> 01:10:01.128
LIAM: Everybody's blacking out.

1937
01:10:01.128 --> 01:10:02.330
SAM: Sorry.

1938
01:10:02.330 --> 01:10:05.670
LIAM: You know, it's just 20 more seconds of time.

1939
01:10:05.670 --> 01:10:08.009
SAM: It was just a little box.

1940
01:10:08.009 --> 01:10:10.660
LIAM: You just build that one little step in,

1941
01:10:10.660 --> 01:10:11.901
just one more little step.

1942
01:10:11.901 --> 01:10:14.676
SAM: Sorry. That one's on me.

1943
01:10:16.333 --> 01:10:17.758
MARISHA: Did you obliterate what's inside?

1944
01:10:17.758 --> 01:10:18.840
SAM: I don't know, what's inside?

1945
01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:19.673
MATT: It's the little gold ring,

1946
01:10:19.673 --> 01:10:22.433
which is now on the ground, amongst the rocks.

1947
01:10:22.433 --> 01:10:24.060
It got blown out a little bit

1948
01:10:24.060 --> 01:10:26.780
from when the explosion happened.

1949
01:10:26.780 --> 01:10:30.290
SAM: Have any runes or gems or anything?

1950
01:10:30.290 --> 01:10:31.590
It's just a simple gold ring?

1951
01:10:31.590 --> 01:10:33.863
MATT: It's a gold ring with a little opal set into it.

1952
01:10:33.863 --> 01:10:35.560
It looks very pretty.

1953
01:10:37.070 --> 01:10:39.470
LAURA: While Nott is distracted,

1954
01:10:39.470 --> 01:10:40.809
and looking at that,
SAM: Caleb, identify that.

1955
01:10:40.809 --> 01:10:42.690
LAURA: I'm going to try to--
TRAVIS: Maybe the other necklace

1956
01:10:42.690 --> 01:10:44.236
LAURA: -- grab her flask--
and the rings too, just in case.

1957
01:10:44.236 --> 01:10:46.020
LAURA: -- and put it in the haversack.
MARISHA: I divvy out 35 gold.

1958
01:10:46.020 --> 01:10:47.200
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check.

1959
01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:49.442
TRAVIS: 35 gold to everybody.

1960
01:10:49.442 --> 01:10:50.275
SAM: Oh, okay!

1961
01:10:50.275 --> 01:10:52.016
LIAM: Good hyping, Fjord.

1962
01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:54.712
LAURA: 12.
LIAM: Caduceus, I have not prepared

1963
01:10:54.712 --> 01:10:58.520
the ability to sense the arcane here.

1964
01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:00.478
LAURA: How many gold?
MARISHA: 35.

1965
01:11:00.478 --> 01:11:01.939
LAURA: 35 gold.

1966
01:11:01.939 --> 01:11:03.782
MATT: Nott, what's your passive perception?

1967
01:11:03.782 --> 01:11:05.080
SAM: Passive perception.

1968
01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:06.890
I'm adding gold.

1969
01:11:06.890 --> 01:11:11.087
Passive perception is ten.

1970
01:11:11.087 --> 01:11:11.920
TALIESIN: A short rest would do--

1971
01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:13.850
MARISHA: Yeah, a short rest would be good.

1972
01:11:13.850 --> 01:11:16.088
TRAVIS: Sure would appreciate a short rest.

1973
01:11:18.691 --> 01:11:20.080
Can we take a short rest while--

1974
01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:21.070
MATT: You can indeed take a short rest.

1975
01:11:21.070 --> 01:11:25.043
TRAVIS: The wizard manually identifies--

1976
01:11:26.591 --> 01:11:27.716
Short rest.

1977
01:11:27.716 --> 01:11:32.700
Hit dice, 1d8 plus four.

1978
01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:34.932
SAM: Oh, are we short resting?
LAURA: Yeah, definitely.

1979
01:11:34.932 --> 01:11:36.210
MATT: You can use your hit dice to heal up if you'd like.

1980
01:11:36.210 --> 01:11:37.550
Get your spells back.

1981
01:11:37.550 --> 01:11:39.300
You, and you get to recover from your arcane recovery.

1982
01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:41.190
LIAM: Yeah, and I'm going to spend ten minutes

1983
01:11:41.190 --> 01:11:42.987
ritual casting Detect Magic

1984
01:11:42.987 --> 01:11:45.350
on everything that was found

1985
01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:46.486
to see if anything--

1986
01:11:46.486 --> 01:11:48.200
MATT: The ring that was in that lockbox

1987
01:11:48.200 --> 01:11:49.410
does give off a magic aura.

1988
01:11:49.410 --> 01:11:50.950
LAURA: Ooh, I definitely want that shit now!

1989
01:11:50.950 --> 01:11:52.860
MATT: It is an abjuration-based aura.

1990
01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:55.130
LIAM: Okay, and I will spend the next ten minutes

1991
01:11:55.130 --> 01:11:57.150
casting Identify the same way.

1992
01:11:57.150 --> 01:11:58.610
MATT: It is a Ring of Protection.

1993
01:11:58.610 --> 01:12:00.874
LIAM: Oh!
LAURA: Whoa!

1994
01:12:00.874 --> 01:12:02.955
SAM: A Ring of Protection?
LAURA: Yasha!

1995
01:12:02.955 --> 01:12:05.484
MARISHA: Fucking worth it!
TALIESIN: Yep.

1996
01:12:05.484 --> 01:12:08.640
SAM: I got a Ring of Protection for myself.

1997
01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:09.730
No?
TALIESIN: No, no.

1998
01:12:09.730 --> 01:12:11.652
ASHLEY: Sure, if you want it.

1999
01:12:11.652 --> 01:12:14.240
ASHLEY: No, of course it's not for me.

2000
01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:15.073
TALIESIN: No.

2001
01:12:15.073 --> 01:12:16.873
LIAM: Beauregard is the one who secured it,

2002
01:12:16.873 --> 01:12:20.431
so she can decide. Here you go, Beauregard.

2003
01:12:20.431 --> 01:12:22.546
And I look at it very longingly.

2004
01:12:22.546 --> 01:12:24.446
(laughter)

2005
01:12:24.446 --> 01:12:25.279
MARISHA: Wait, really?

2006
01:12:27.418 --> 01:12:29.380
No, I'm sorry.
LIAM: Have we met?

2007
01:12:29.380 --> 01:12:32.142
<i>Hallo,</i> I am Caleb Widogast.

2008
01:12:33.198 --> 01:12:35.210
MARISHA: A new Caleb is here, everybody.

2009
01:12:36.182 --> 01:12:38.557
TRAVIS: New Caleb?

2010
01:12:38.557 --> 01:12:40.520
MARISHA: Sharing his loot.

2011
01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:42.370
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, that's true.

2012
01:12:42.370 --> 01:12:43.620
You should take a moment.

2013
01:12:44.502 --> 01:12:48.331
LIAM: Actually, I've been giving loot out for months.

2014
01:12:48.331 --> 01:12:51.190
MARISHA: I'm just giving you shit!

2015
01:12:51.190 --> 01:12:52.210
LIAM: Ow, ow, ow.

2016
01:12:52.210 --> 01:12:55.010
SAM: That's the shoulder he had surgery.

2017
01:12:55.010 --> 01:12:55.843
LIAM: Two points.

2018
01:12:58.020 --> 01:12:59.640
Those are weapons.

2019
01:13:00.573 --> 01:13:02.450
TRAVIS: Yeah, they literally charge electricity and shit.

2020
01:13:02.450 --> 01:13:03.283
MARISHA: Sorry.

2021
01:13:03.283 --> 01:13:04.978
(electricity crackling)

2022
01:13:04.978 --> 01:13:06.160
LAURA: Both Yasha and Caleb could use that.

2023
01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:09.010
MARISHA: Did you already get a ring?

2024
01:13:09.010 --> 01:13:10.670
Where did we get that other ring?

2025
01:13:10.670 --> 01:13:12.060
Didn't we have one already?

2026
01:13:12.060 --> 01:13:14.030
LIAM: We got it from Waccoh.

2027
01:13:14.030 --> 01:13:16.120
LAURA: Yeah, so you already have one on, right?

2028
01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:17.811
You can't have more than one.

2029
01:13:17.811 --> 01:13:19.240
SAM: You can have two, I think.

2030
01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:20.597
One on each hand.

2031
01:13:20.597 --> 01:13:22.610
Even so...

2032
01:13:24.230 --> 01:13:25.100
Caleb is...

2033
01:13:27.294 --> 01:13:29.120
MATT: You can have multiple rings.

2034
01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:32.403
It's about how many things you can have attuned to.

2035
01:13:32.403 --> 01:13:34.369
TRAVIS: What does it do? Is it plus to AC?

2036
01:13:34.369 --> 01:13:35.202
SAM: It's plus one probably, right?

2037
01:13:35.202 --> 01:13:36.770
MATT: Plus one to your AC and I believe saving throws.

2038
01:13:36.770 --> 01:13:37.960
LIAM: Give it to Yasha.

2039
01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:40.190
MARISHA: You already have one though, right?

2040
01:13:40.190 --> 01:13:41.193
LIAM: I have something else.

2041
01:13:41.193 --> 01:13:42.976
It makes more sense for Yasha.

2042
01:13:42.976 --> 01:13:44.292
MARISHA: You have something else?

2043
01:13:44.292 --> 01:13:45.930
LIAM: Well, I would love to wear it,

2044
01:13:45.930 --> 01:13:49.290
but I can only concentrate on so many items at once.

2045
01:13:49.290 --> 01:13:50.830
MARISHA: Oh.
LAURA: Mm, mm, mm-hmm.

2046
01:13:51.690 --> 01:13:55.700
ASHLEY: Maybe once I get my bracers and everything,

2047
01:13:55.700 --> 01:13:57.200
would you want to take it?

2048
01:13:57.200 --> 01:13:59.580
LIAM: If I lose something, yeah.

2049
01:13:59.580 --> 01:14:00.413
ASHLEY: Okay.

2050
01:14:00.413 --> 01:14:01.246
LAURA: If you lose something, you can give it

2051
01:14:01.246 --> 01:14:02.721
to somebody else and they can use

2052
01:14:02.721 --> 01:14:04.400
the thing that you don't need anymore.

2053
01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:07.176
SAM: Yeah, what other things do you want to get rid of?

2054
01:14:07.176 --> 01:14:08.640
I think she's saying if you something

2055
01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:10.360
you want to get rid of--
MARISHA: Here you go, Yasha.

2056
01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:12.418
LIAM: No, I don't. I don't.

2057
01:14:12.418 --> 01:14:13.370
LAURA: Hey, Yasha.

2058
01:14:13.370 --> 01:14:14.203
ASHLEY: Yeah?

2059
01:14:14.203 --> 01:14:17.463
LAURA: Beau just give you a ring.

2060
01:14:18.453 --> 01:14:20.341
ASHLEY: Does that mean what I think it means?

2061
01:14:20.341 --> 01:14:22.180
SAM: What finger are you going to put it on?

2062
01:14:22.180 --> 01:14:23.620
ASHLEY: I'm going to put it on this one.

2063
01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:27.348
TRAVIS: Yeah!
(laughter)

2064
01:14:27.348 --> 01:14:29.164
SAM: For Beau, that means marriage!

2065
01:14:29.164 --> 01:14:34.164
(laughter)

2066
01:14:34.352 --> 01:14:35.310
MATT: All right, so you can go ahead

2067
01:14:35.310 --> 01:14:37.060
and add that to your character sheet, if you want to.

2068
01:14:37.060 --> 01:14:39.390
Just go to equipment and add Ring of Protection.

2069
01:14:39.390 --> 01:14:40.910
ASHLEY: Okay.
MATT: Do it there,

2070
01:14:40.910 --> 01:14:42.260
and make sure to attune it.

2071
01:14:43.250 --> 01:14:45.230
All right, so you finish your short rest.

2072
01:14:45.230 --> 01:14:46.640
You spend your hit dice.

2073
01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:48.350
It has been a very eventful morning.

2074
01:14:48.350 --> 01:14:50.070
You're now pushing close to noon

2075
01:14:50.070 --> 01:14:51.600
in the time that you guys have traveled

2076
01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:56.600
up and down the tree, across this ten, 15-minute jaunt

2077
01:14:57.070 --> 01:14:58.248
out into the Barbed Fields.

2078
01:14:58.248 --> 01:15:00.158
Enough time has passed where you don't

2079
01:15:00.158 --> 01:15:02.460
necessarily feel like you're immediately

2080
01:15:02.460 --> 01:15:05.119
being beared down on by an angry roc.

2081
01:15:05.119 --> 01:15:07.640
LAURA: (gasps) Caleb, can you sent Frumpkin out

2082
01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:09.513
and see if the bird is looking at us still?

2083
01:15:09.513 --> 01:15:10.350
LIAM: Of course.

2084
01:15:12.786 --> 01:15:13.619
(screeches)

2085
01:15:13.619 --> 01:15:14.452
MATT: Okay, goes up.

2086
01:15:14.452 --> 01:15:16.260
Perception check for Frumpkin's vulture.

2087
01:15:16.260 --> 01:15:17.474
LIAM: Yeah, vulture.

2088
01:15:17.474 --> 01:15:19.250
Perception check you said, <i>ja</i>?

2089
01:15:19.250 --> 01:15:20.930
MATT: Correct.
LAURA: That's pretty good.

2090
01:15:20.930 --> 01:15:22.830
I go over to vulture.

2091
01:15:22.830 --> 01:15:25.510
That's giant eagle. That's the wrong one.

2092
01:15:25.510 --> 01:15:28.080
Oh, Jesus. I'm just going to make a straight roll, 16.

2093
01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:28.913
MATT: 16, okay.

2094
01:15:28.913 --> 01:15:33.913
I'll say because of the creature's size, it is visible.

2095
01:15:34.078 --> 01:15:35.910
Frumpkin does see it.

2096
01:15:35.910 --> 01:15:39.410
It is way off and has no scope of what distance,

2097
01:15:39.410 --> 01:15:40.990
but it is quite a ways away,

2098
01:15:40.990 --> 01:15:45.350
anywhere between 50, 60 miles away.

2099
01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:47.435
SAM: Oh, wow.
TRAVIS: (car engine revving)

2100
01:15:47.435 --> 01:15:49.230
MATT: Possible 20 miles away.

2101
01:15:49.230 --> 01:15:50.660
Possible ten.

2102
01:15:50.660 --> 01:15:54.148
It's hard to tell at this distance with the size of it.

2103
01:15:54.148 --> 01:15:55.089
It's still looking.

2104
01:15:55.089 --> 01:15:59.350
It's definitely still present and hasn't given up,

2105
01:15:59.350 --> 01:16:02.199
it's just in a different direction for now.

2106
01:16:02.199 --> 01:16:04.350
LIAM: It's out in the distance.

2107
01:16:04.350 --> 01:16:06.090
Can't tell quite how much,

2108
01:16:06.090 --> 01:16:09.120
but we need to go carefully if we are going to go.

2109
01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:09.953
SAM: Let's go.

2110
01:16:09.953 --> 01:16:11.351
LIAM: Or perhaps we wait till the nighttime.

2111
01:16:11.351 --> 01:16:13.500
SAM: Wait, we're losing this fellow.

2112
01:16:14.450 --> 01:16:16.320
Obann is getting away.

2113
01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:18.034
We need to move.
LAURA: Yeah, we got to go.

2114
01:16:18.034 --> 01:16:19.553
TRAVIS: Let's ride.

2115
01:16:19.553 --> 01:16:21.002
TALIESIN: Plus one won't stack.

2116
01:16:22.063 --> 01:16:23.650
SAM: You guys okay over there?

2117
01:16:23.650 --> 01:16:25.316
TALIESIN: What? Yeah.

2118
01:16:25.316 --> 01:16:27.120
ASHLEY: Looking at this ring. Let's go.

2119
01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:27.953
MATT: All right.

2120
01:16:27.953 --> 01:16:29.610
You all get back on your moorbounders,

2121
01:16:29.610 --> 01:16:34.150
exit the backside of this small, two-way cavern

2122
01:16:34.150 --> 01:16:37.400
and start heading northward once more.

2123
01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:40.641
As you're riding past the little puddles

2124
01:16:40.641 --> 01:16:43.190
and ponds of remaining rain water

2125
01:16:43.190 --> 01:16:44.310
that haven't quite fully absorbed

2126
01:16:44.310 --> 01:16:46.231
into the hard-packed earth,

2127
01:16:46.231 --> 01:16:47.600
you start making your way

2128
01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:49.350
for the remainder of the day forward.

2129
01:16:49.350 --> 01:16:51.130
Yes?
TRAVIS: Out where we are,

2130
01:16:51.130 --> 01:16:53.140
is there any of that grass on the ground

2131
01:16:53.140 --> 01:16:55.148
that was appearing near the tree?

2132
01:16:55.148 --> 01:16:56.370
MATT: Where you are now?

2133
01:16:56.370 --> 01:16:58.686
Absolutely not.
TRAVIS: It's the wastelands.

2134
01:16:58.686 --> 01:16:59.519
MATT: Yeah.

2135
01:16:59.519 --> 01:17:01.523
Pretty much a hundred feet out from the tree

2136
01:17:01.523 --> 01:17:04.735
is the extent of where any of that seems to grow,

2137
01:17:04.735 --> 01:17:07.660
and that's only when night falls, it seems.

2138
01:17:07.660 --> 01:17:08.907
TRAVIS: Interesting.

2139
01:17:08.907 --> 01:17:11.770
MATT: When you first arrived at the tree

2140
01:17:11.770 --> 01:17:13.400
and when you left the tree--
TRAVIS: It was dead.

2141
01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:14.750
MATT: It was all beginning to die away.

2142
01:17:14.750 --> 01:17:17.320
It seems like about ten, 15 feet

2143
01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:19.570
from its base is always verdant,

2144
01:17:19.570 --> 01:17:22.040
and then further out it seems to extend in the night

2145
01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:24.491
and then retract in the day.
TRAVIS: Motherfucking Pelor.

2146
01:17:24.491 --> 01:17:26.670
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Okay.

2147
01:17:26.670 --> 01:17:31.670
MATT: Cruising on, are you going fast pace?

2148
01:17:31.808 --> 01:17:36.730
SAM: I think slow to start, and then 15 minutes after

2149
01:17:36.730 --> 01:17:39.222
we'll speed up a little.

2150
01:17:39.222 --> 01:17:40.813
TALIESIN: Keep an eye.

2151
01:17:40.813 --> 01:17:42.220
LAURA: Enough that we don't get jumped

2152
01:17:42.220 --> 01:17:45.160
by those things again because we're going too fast.

2153
01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:47.340
We need to keep an eye out of other monsters.

2154
01:17:47.340 --> 01:17:48.815
TALIESIN: Eye on the sky. There's lots--

2155
01:17:48.815 --> 01:17:50.210
MATT: Perception check from you

2156
01:17:50.210 --> 01:17:52.280
are you're taking point from this again, Caduceus.

2157
01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:53.330
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah.
TRAVIS: Go on.

2158
01:17:54.890 --> 01:17:58.030
TALIESIN: Eh, 11.
MATT: 11, okay.

2159
01:17:58.030 --> 01:17:59.080
You guys are cruising forward,

2160
01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:00.919
cruising forward, making your way.

2161
01:18:00.919 --> 01:18:02.770
You go around this one section

2162
01:18:02.770 --> 01:18:05.467
where there's a crevasse that begins to dig down.

2163
01:18:05.467 --> 01:18:07.290
Not like a super deep crevasse,

2164
01:18:07.290 --> 01:18:08.440
but there's a point where the ground

2165
01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:10.300
begins to slowly sink

2166
01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:13.870
between two cliff walls of this small valley,

2167
01:18:13.870 --> 01:18:15.960
maybe about 23 feet across.

2168
01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:17.460
You guys want to crest on the upper edge

2169
01:18:17.460 --> 01:18:18.990
or go through or on the other side?

2170
01:18:18.990 --> 01:18:20.290
What would you like to do?

2171
01:18:21.860 --> 01:18:23.999
SAM: I'm no tactician, but it feels like

2172
01:18:23.999 --> 01:18:26.600
not down in the middle, right?

2173
01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:28.850
Because that's ambush point.
LAURA: Yeah, we should go around.

2174
01:18:28.850 --> 01:18:30.170
MATT: Okay, right or left?

2175
01:18:30.170 --> 01:18:32.420
SAM: Fjord's been rubbing off on me a little bit.

2176
01:18:32.420 --> 01:18:33.332
TALIESIN: Where's the sun?

2177
01:18:33.332 --> 01:18:34.960
MATT: The sun right now?

2178
01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:37.880
It's moved past the zenith,

2179
01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:40.450
so it's about, I'd say, two o'clock in the afternoon,

2180
01:18:40.450 --> 01:18:42.160
three o'clock in the afternoon.

2181
01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:43.030
It's starting to push its way

2182
01:18:43.030 --> 01:18:44.330
a little bit this way in the sky.

2183
01:18:44.330 --> 01:18:45.650
There are still clouds present,

2184
01:18:45.650 --> 01:18:46.780
but they're starting to break up a little bit.

2185
01:18:46.780 --> 01:18:48.340
You have little glimpses of blue sky

2186
01:18:48.340 --> 01:18:49.930
and the day is getting hotter.

2187
01:18:52.110 --> 01:18:53.830
TALIESIN: I'd say left, personally.
LAURA: Me too!

2188
01:18:53.830 --> 01:18:54.930
I was going to say left, too.

2189
01:18:54.930 --> 01:18:56.750
ASHLEY: Me too, guys.
TALIESIN: Then it's unanimous.

2190
01:18:56.750 --> 01:18:58.515
MATT: All right, you cruise to the left.

2191
01:18:58.515 --> 01:19:02.144
ASHLEY: And we all die instantly.
TALIESIN: (gags)

2192
01:19:02.144 --> 01:19:03.849
MATT: You move to the left.

2193
01:19:03.849 --> 01:19:05.920
As you come up to the edge and crest

2194
01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:07.600
up to the top there you can see

2195
01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:09.880
there are a couple of small huts

2196
01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:11.210
and a tent set up there.

2197
01:19:12.222 --> 01:19:17.222
Immediately you hear (horn blaring),

2198
01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:21.750
and a cluster of orc marauders

2199
01:19:21.750 --> 01:19:22.920
start rushing in your direction

2200
01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:24.790
and getting arrows ready. (clicking)

2201
01:19:24.790 --> 01:19:27.320
TALIESIN: Oh, for god's sakes.
SAM: Good decision, guys.

2202
01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:28.503
TALIESIN: Rushing on foot or--

2203
01:19:28.503 --> 01:19:30.810
MATT: They rush out and stopped.

2204
01:19:30.810 --> 01:19:32.080
As you guys are cruising by,

2205
01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:34.710
they're now starting to pass you on the right.

2206
01:19:34.710 --> 01:19:36.675
TRAVIS: Fucking cavalry ride through.

2207
01:19:36.675 --> 01:19:38.240
SAM: Just go?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2208
01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:39.073
SAM: Hi-yah!

2209
01:19:39.073 --> 01:19:40.240
MATT: You guys just pick up.

2210
01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:41.336
Moorbounders pick up pace.

2211
01:19:41.336 --> 01:19:44.250
You're rushing forward. (crashing footsteps)

2212
01:19:44.250 --> 01:19:47.350
Four of them do get arrow shots at the moorbounders.

2213
01:19:48.664 --> 01:19:52.155
That is going to be a hit.

2214
01:19:54.210 --> 01:19:56.020
Two hits on your moorbounder.

2215
01:19:57.402 --> 01:19:59.530
LAURA: Are orcs considered humanoid?

2216
01:19:59.530 --> 01:20:03.380
MATT: Yes, they are. That's a critical hit on Jester's.

2217
01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:04.560
SAM: Oh, no.
TALIESIN: Undone.

2218
01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:05.890
LAURA: Oh, yeah!
MATT: Undone.

2219
01:20:05.890 --> 01:20:08.470
Then all four hit, because moorbounders

2220
01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:10.020
do not have a huge armor class.

2221
01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:13.210
So two hits on yours because you were the one up front

2222
01:20:13.210 --> 01:20:14.932
and then one on each of your moorbounders.

2223
01:20:14.932 --> 01:20:17.610
SAM: Oh, god.

2224
01:20:17.610 --> 01:20:19.526
MARISHA: Can I deflect the one that's

2225
01:20:19.526 --> 01:20:20.359
hitting Jannik?
MATT: It wasn't

2226
01:20:20.359 --> 01:20:22.230
unfortunately at you.

2227
01:20:22.230 --> 01:20:24.590
You'd have to like mark out of the way.

2228
01:20:24.590 --> 01:20:25.640
You know what?

2229
01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:27.860
It's fun. Make an acrobatics check.

2230
01:20:27.860 --> 01:20:29.530
It's going to be difficult to do this,

2231
01:20:29.530 --> 01:20:32.490
so you have to roll real high to try this.

2232
01:20:32.490 --> 01:20:34.600
MARISHA: Look, I just watched John Wick 3

2233
01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:36.330
and he said that it was possible.

2234
01:20:36.330 --> 01:20:38.345
Acrobatics?
MATT: Yes.

2235
01:20:38.345 --> 01:20:40.329
MARISHA: 21.
MATT: 21?

2236
01:20:40.329 --> 01:20:42.819
Not quite good enough, unfortunately.

2237
01:20:42.819 --> 01:20:44.450
You try and reach and you start

2238
01:20:44.450 --> 01:20:47.550
cruising off to the side and your hand goes for it,

2239
01:20:47.550 --> 01:20:49.440
but it's just a little bit out of your reach.

2240
01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:50.565
MARISHA: Okay.

2241
01:20:50.565 --> 01:20:52.410
LIAM: How far away are they from us at this point?

2242
01:20:52.410 --> 01:20:54.920
MATT: At this point, they're about 50 feet.

2243
01:20:54.920 --> 01:20:58.232
That's going to be 13 points of piercing

2244
01:20:58.232 --> 01:21:00.180
damage to your moorbounder,

2245
01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:02.250
which brings him to close to half health.

2246
01:21:02.250 --> 01:21:03.330
TALIESIN: 13 points of damage?
MATT: Correct.

2247
01:21:03.330 --> 01:21:04.996
Just keep tabs on that.

2248
01:21:04.996 --> 01:21:08.060
Then that's going to be seven to yours.

2249
01:21:08.060 --> 01:21:10.060
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: And five to yours.

2250
01:21:10.060 --> 01:21:10.893
LIAM: Okay, good.

2251
01:21:10.893 --> 01:21:13.530
Well, when that happens, I clap some bat guano

2252
01:21:13.530 --> 01:21:15.130
and sulfur together in my hands

2253
01:21:15.130 --> 01:21:17.300
and throw a Fireball behind them

2254
01:21:17.300 --> 01:21:19.774
by about 30 feet, 20 feet.
MARISHA: Dope.

2255
01:21:19.774 --> 01:21:21.501
MATT: As they're going after their second arrow,

2256
01:21:21.501 --> 01:21:24.310
(explosion) they all get thrown forward

2257
01:21:24.310 --> 01:21:27.134
about ten feet. You see the tent just explode,

2258
01:21:27.134 --> 01:21:29.570
as well as another half dozen

2259
01:21:29.570 --> 01:21:32.600
or so orcs that were inside to get their armor on and ready.

2260
01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:35.230
They just get blown out of it.

2261
01:21:36.412 --> 01:21:38.000
Go ahead and roll damage, actual damage on this.

2262
01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:38.860
I want to know.

2263
01:21:40.070 --> 01:21:42.680
TRAVIS: Impossible to do.
MATT: Roll damage.

2264
01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:46.212
LIAM: Just doing basics.
SAM: (German accent) The basics.

2265
01:21:46.212 --> 01:21:48.287
(laughs)

2266
01:21:50.150 --> 01:21:51.381
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2267
01:21:51.381 --> 01:21:54.623
LIAM: Ten, 13, 16, 19, 21.

2268
01:21:54.623 --> 01:21:57.770
26 points of damage.

2269
01:21:57.770 --> 01:21:59.292
MATT: 26, okay.

2270
01:21:59.292 --> 01:22:01.140
You watch as about four of them

2271
01:22:01.140 --> 01:22:04.560
just get thrown about 15 feet (clunking)

2272
01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:05.760
not moving on the ground.

2273
01:22:06.830 --> 01:22:09.390
The rest of them are injured,

2274
01:22:09.390 --> 01:22:12.600
but stand back up and watch you guys just coasting away.

2275
01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:13.433
They look at each other

2276
01:22:13.433 --> 01:22:15.240
and realize they can't really keep up,

2277
01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:16.620
but the one that's holding the horn

2278
01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:18.880
gives another horn sound, (horn blaring)

2279
01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:21.226
echoing down into the area,

2280
01:22:21.226 --> 01:22:22.090
and you can see a little bit

2281
01:22:22.090 --> 01:22:24.058
of dust gathering on the opposite side

2282
01:22:24.058 --> 01:22:25.970
of the cavern, the other ridge.

2283
01:22:25.970 --> 01:22:27.181
LAURA: How far away is that?

2284
01:22:27.181 --> 01:22:29.150
MATT: That would be, from where you are right now,

2285
01:22:29.150 --> 01:22:32.177
about 120 feet.
MARISHA: Are they also on mounts?

2286
01:22:32.177 --> 01:22:33.952
MATT: It looks like they are.

2287
01:22:33.952 --> 01:22:36.106
You don't know what kind.
LAURA: I'm going to cast...

2288
01:22:36.106 --> 01:22:36.939
Shit.

2289
01:22:36.939 --> 01:22:40.206
LIAM: Would I have made a wisdom save for humanoid orcs?

2290
01:22:40.206 --> 01:22:44.717
MATT: Yeah, you would.
SAM: Oh, that's right!

2291
01:22:44.717 --> 01:22:48.680
LIAM: Oh, flying colors. 26.

2292
01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:50.088
MATT: Yes, yeah. You beat that, no problem.

2293
01:22:50.088 --> 01:22:53.641
MARISHA: Jannik just starts to veer off.

2294
01:22:53.641 --> 01:22:55.425
(quick footsteps)

2295
01:22:55.425 --> 01:22:58.170
LAURA: I'm going to cast around in that whole group

2296
01:22:58.170 --> 01:23:01.196
of orcs that are getting up and out.

2297
01:23:01.196 --> 01:23:02.846
I'm going to say:

2298
01:23:02.846 --> 01:23:04.762
Hello, bees!

2299
01:23:04.762 --> 01:23:07.964
And I'm going to cast Insect Plague on them.

2300
01:23:07.964 --> 01:23:10.820
TRAVIS: You're going to cast what?

2301
01:23:10.820 --> 01:23:13.145
MATT: All right, so as this massive...

2302
01:23:13.145 --> 01:23:16.270
You watch as a thousand tiny little flashes

2303
01:23:16.270 --> 01:23:17.730
of light (fire sparking),

2304
01:23:17.730 --> 01:23:19.730
like a tiny sparkler goes off.
LAURA: All bees!

2305
01:23:19.730 --> 01:23:23.598
MATT: And then a swarm of bees (bees buzzing).

2306
01:23:23.598 --> 01:23:28.598
These orcs are like, "Hey, come look! (screams)"

2307
01:23:28.934 --> 01:23:31.651
Then they're just being assaulted by this cloud of bees.

2308
01:23:31.651 --> 01:23:33.150
They're completely negated.

2309
01:23:33.150 --> 01:23:34.400
You guys are too fast for them

2310
01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:35.704
to even consider catching up.

2311
01:23:35.704 --> 01:23:37.590
What's the range on that one?

2312
01:23:37.590 --> 01:23:39.350
LAURA: 300 feet.
MATT: 300 feet.

2313
01:23:39.350 --> 01:23:42.403
You watch as the ones that are riding on wargs.

2314
01:23:42.403 --> 01:23:43.334
LIAM: Wargs?

2315
01:23:43.334 --> 01:23:45.460
MATT: Yeah, the wargs all of a sudden start flipping out

2316
01:23:45.460 --> 01:23:46.550
and going from side to side.

2317
01:23:46.550 --> 01:23:47.760
They're going to try and hold on.

2318
01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:48.950
TRAVIS: Attack their masters!

2319
01:23:50.690 --> 01:23:52.770
LAURA: It obscured their vision, too, of the area.

2320
01:23:52.770 --> 01:23:55.440
SAM: Wow, that's powerful.
MATT: All right.

2321
01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:59.240
Two of them manage to maintain holding on to their wargs.

2322
01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:02.380
The others get thrown off onto the ground.

2323
01:24:02.380 --> 01:24:04.430
Their wargs are now trying to wipe their face

2324
01:24:04.430 --> 01:24:07.143
and trying to get the bees out of their eyes.

2325
01:24:07.143 --> 01:24:10.180
The shrieking (growls) in the distance.

2326
01:24:11.050 --> 01:24:13.570
Their attempt to try and catch up

2327
01:24:13.570 --> 01:24:16.830
has been definitely set back quite a bit.

2328
01:24:16.830 --> 01:24:17.940
There's still two more that are pushed

2329
01:24:17.940 --> 01:24:19.620
out of the cloud and are trying

2330
01:24:19.620 --> 01:24:21.050
to catch up to you,

2331
01:24:21.050 --> 01:24:22.930
and as you guys move forward (footsteps thumping)--

2332
01:24:22.930 --> 01:24:25.360
TALIESIN: I'm going to do a Mass Healing Word

2333
01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:29.672
with a bonus action at level three for our mounts.

2334
01:24:29.672 --> 01:24:31.438
LAURA: For our mounts. Oh, okay. (laughs)

2335
01:24:31.438 --> 01:24:32.271
I'm like wait, what?

2336
01:24:32.271 --> 01:24:34.200
TALIESIN: Ooh, that's nice.
MATT: He's that helpful.

2337
01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:37.107
TALIESIN: All of them gain nine hit points back.

2338
01:24:37.107 --> 01:24:38.198
LAURA: Woo, full health!

2339
01:24:38.198 --> 01:24:39.720
LIAM: I absolutely have more fire to throw, too,

2340
01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:41.440
if they're in range, then I would.

2341
01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:43.670
MATT: Well, over there they're about a hundred feet now.

2342
01:24:43.670 --> 01:24:45.320
They're starting to try and cruise in towards you,

2343
01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:46.200
the two that are still around.

2344
01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:49.561
LIAM: It's a 50-foot range, so I will finish the job.

2345
01:24:49.561 --> 01:24:51.370
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll

2346
01:24:51.370 --> 01:24:52.820
your damage for your Fireball

2347
01:24:53.996 --> 01:24:55.800
for the two that are over there.

2348
01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:57.587
SAM: Oh, boy.

2349
01:24:57.587 --> 01:24:59.674
LIAM: Not as good there.

2350
01:24:59.674 --> 01:25:01.460
SAM: A lot of ones.
LIAM: 11, 12.

2351
01:25:01.460 --> 01:25:03.625
17, 18.
MARISHA: (accented) I will finish the job.

2352
01:25:03.625 --> 01:25:05.623
(laughs)
LIAM: 23.

2353
01:25:05.623 --> 01:25:06.710
MATT: 23.

2354
01:25:08.328 --> 01:25:10.294
(explosion) The explosion hits.

2355
01:25:10.294 --> 01:25:15.294
You watch as both of the orcs get burned to shit,

2356
01:25:15.545 --> 01:25:17.520
are still on the backs

2357
01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:19.340
and still like (growls) pushing through.

2358
01:25:19.340 --> 01:25:21.230
These are tougher than the standard fare orcs.

2359
01:25:21.230 --> 01:25:23.750
The wargs are extremely hurt,

2360
01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:24.740
but still surviving.

2361
01:25:24.740 --> 01:25:26.760
They skip and tumble a bit.

2362
01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:29.260
They manage to maintain, I'm going to say...

2363
01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:31.913
It's cocked..

2364
01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:34.200
No, they're fleeing.

2365
01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:35.912
The wargs veer off to the side,

2366
01:25:35.912 --> 01:25:39.080
and both war parties seem to,

2367
01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:41.274
another horn goes off but it's a different tone.

2368
01:25:41.274 --> 01:25:44.496
(horn blaring)

2369
01:25:44.496 --> 01:25:47.160
(laughter)

2370
01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:51.190
MATT: Akin to.
TRAVIS: (sad trombone) ♪ Ba, ba, ba, ba ♪

2371
01:25:51.190 --> 01:25:53.180
MATT: Calling off the attack and riding

2372
01:25:53.180 --> 01:25:54.100
on for another minute or so.

2373
01:25:54.100 --> 01:25:56.304
You look behind and there's no additional chase

2374
01:25:56.304 --> 01:25:57.630
following you.

2375
01:25:57.630 --> 01:26:00.838
SAM: Did we just defeat a whole village in like 30 seconds?

2376
01:26:00.838 --> 01:26:01.895
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2377
01:26:01.895 --> 01:26:05.090
SAM: But it took us days to leave a tree?

2378
01:26:05.090 --> 01:26:08.817
(laughter)
MATT: Yep.

2379
01:26:08.817 --> 01:26:10.499
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

2380
01:26:10.499 --> 01:26:12.310
Do you need to check the arrow wounds

2381
01:26:12.310 --> 01:26:14.470
in case they were poison-tipped or anything?

2382
01:26:14.470 --> 01:26:16.830
SAM: Oh, on our moorbounders? Good idea.

2383
01:26:16.830 --> 01:26:17.663
Clerics?

2384
01:26:21.267 --> 01:26:22.322
LAURA: I guess we should.

2385
01:26:22.322 --> 01:26:24.070
TALIESIN: I mean, I healed it and it seemed to do the--

2386
01:26:24.070 --> 01:26:26.650
MATT: Yeah. It didn't seem they had time

2387
01:26:26.650 --> 01:26:30.711
to do any sort of poison-based tip on these yet.

2388
01:26:30.711 --> 01:26:32.172
Yeah, this is an initial assault.

2389
01:26:32.172 --> 01:26:34.340
You guys came up very quickly on them,

2390
01:26:34.340 --> 01:26:35.560
and they weren't prepared for ambush.

2391
01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:37.283
They were just on this ridge

2392
01:26:37.283 --> 01:26:41.591
before you just rode up and blew the shit out them.

2393
01:26:43.627 --> 01:26:45.079
TRAVIS: (explosion)

2394
01:26:45.079 --> 01:26:46.899
LIAM: Gary, do you see those guys? (explosion)

2395
01:26:46.899 --> 01:26:48.200
MATT: (laughs) Essentially.

2396
01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:49.678
TALIESIN: Shouldn't have blown the horn, man.

2397
01:26:49.678 --> 01:26:51.710
TRAVIS: Down with the razor. (explosion)

2398
01:26:51.710 --> 01:26:53.050
MATT: There's an entire page of possible

2399
01:26:53.050 --> 01:26:54.532
interactions there I can put aside.

2400
01:26:54.532 --> 01:26:55.365
ALL: Ooh!

2401
01:26:55.365 --> 01:26:56.550
TALIESIN: Hey, they were shooting at us!

2402
01:26:56.550 --> 01:26:58.295
MATT: Of course they were!

2403
01:26:58.295 --> 01:27:00.070
I didn't say it was positive encounters.

2404
01:27:00.070 --> 01:27:01.620
It could have been all sorts of interestingness.

2405
01:27:01.620 --> 01:27:03.640
TRAVIS: That was good.
MATT: That was fun.

2406
01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:06.331
It was interesting. It was very Mad Max-ish.

2407
01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:11.550
Pressing forward, Caduceus, as you're on point,

2408
01:27:11.550 --> 01:27:12.900
make another perception check for me, please.

2409
01:27:12.900 --> 01:27:14.190
TRAVIS: Come, baby.
TALIESIN: Better than last time.

2410
01:27:14.190 --> 01:27:15.758
It was embarrassing.

2411
01:27:15.758 --> 01:27:17.983
Better! 19.

2412
01:27:17.983 --> 01:27:21.170
MATT: You do see the emerging shadow of the roc

2413
01:27:21.170 --> 01:27:23.883
coasting in your direction

2414
01:27:25.140 --> 01:27:26.550
before it begins to arc.

2415
01:27:26.550 --> 01:27:30.651
I want everyone to try and carefully maneuver

2416
01:27:30.651 --> 01:27:32.410
into a stealthy position,

2417
01:27:32.410 --> 01:27:33.370
probably slowing your speed a bit.

2418
01:27:33.370 --> 01:27:34.861
LIAM: So stealth checks?
MATT: Yep.

2419
01:27:34.861 --> 01:27:37.060
MARISHA: All of us?
MATT: Yes, all of you, please.

2420
01:27:37.060 --> 01:27:38.110
TRAVIS: You still have that?

2421
01:27:38.110 --> 01:27:39.460
LIAM: Pass Without a Trace is gone.

2422
01:27:39.460 --> 01:27:40.814
LAURA: It is gone.
MATT: Yeah.

2423
01:27:41.672 --> 01:27:44.583
TALIESIN: Hey! Oh, man.

2424
01:27:44.583 --> 01:27:46.180
TRAVIS: Eight.

2425
01:27:46.180 --> 01:27:48.139
MARISHA: 18.
LIAM: 16.

2426
01:27:48.139 --> 01:27:49.723
SAM: 21.

2427
01:27:49.723 --> 01:27:52.000
LAURA: Ten. (laughs)
TALIESIN: 18.

2428
01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.890
ASHLEY: 16.
MATT: Okay, wow.

2429
01:27:53.890 --> 01:27:57.723
That's actually a good spread.
TALIESIN: Solid.

2430
01:27:58.610 --> 01:28:00.219
MATT: Okay.

2431
01:28:00.219 --> 01:28:02.620
You see the shape grow larger and larger,

2432
01:28:02.620 --> 01:28:07.521
the dark, winged entity (wings flapping).

2433
01:28:07.521 --> 01:28:10.840
It just circles off and continues

2434
01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:13.449
doing a loop just off to the west side,

2435
01:28:13.449 --> 01:28:16.860
seemingly just barely missing the opportunity

2436
01:28:16.860 --> 01:28:19.572
to make out your pack heading northward.

2437
01:28:19.572 --> 01:28:21.390
SAM: What if it follows us forever?

2438
01:28:21.390 --> 01:28:24.332
(laughter)

2439
01:28:24.332 --> 01:28:25.350
TRAVIS: It's an evil drone.

2440
01:28:25.350 --> 01:28:27.190
LIAM: We get out of the ship to Tal'Dorei

2441
01:28:27.190 --> 01:28:29.074
and it's just (wings flapping).

2442
01:28:29.074 --> 01:28:31.416
MARISHA: Aw, damn it!

2443
01:28:31.416 --> 01:28:32.249
TALIESIN: (screeches)

2444
01:28:32.249 --> 01:28:33.082
SAM: Hello, mama!

2445
01:28:33.082 --> 01:28:36.724
I am very, oh, my god!
(laughter)

2446
01:28:36.724 --> 01:28:39.910
MATT: The first true rival of campaign two has been decided.

2447
01:28:41.860 --> 01:28:43.910
All right, so--
TALIESIN: We can defeat the roc.

2448
01:28:45.130 --> 01:28:50.130
MATT: Moving forward, the day begins to come to an end.

2449
01:28:50.244 --> 01:28:53.722
The sun begins to set against the mountains in the distance.

2450
01:28:53.722 --> 01:28:56.478
The water left from the rain seem

2451
01:28:56.478 --> 01:29:00.170
to have mostly vanished into the earth,

2452
01:29:00.170 --> 01:29:03.405
the mud begins to turn to dried ground

2453
01:29:04.430 --> 01:29:07.140
and night is coming.

2454
01:29:07.140 --> 01:29:09.090
You can see Bazzoxan in the distance,

2455
01:29:09.090 --> 01:29:10.980
but you're not going to make it before the sun hits.

2456
01:29:10.980 --> 01:29:12.490
You've taken a few breaks today

2457
01:29:12.490 --> 01:29:14.143
and have slowed a bit of travel,

2458
01:29:14.143 --> 01:29:17.910
so you could either break for the night somewhere

2459
01:29:17.910 --> 01:29:21.040
or press on for an addition hour of travel.

2460
01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:23.410
SAM: I say we press on!

2461
01:29:23.410 --> 01:29:25.000
TRAVIS: I vote press.

2462
01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:26.410
MARISHA: Press.
LIAM: Agreed.

2463
01:29:26.410 --> 01:29:28.780
LAURA: I vote if we fight something else,

2464
01:29:28.780 --> 01:29:33.780
we are wiped the fuck out and we will die probably.

2465
01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:35.470
TALIESIN: We can find maybe a proper--

2466
01:29:35.470 --> 01:29:37.000
Bazzoxan's a real town, right?

2467
01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:38.460
It's a town.
MATT: You don't know.

2468
01:29:38.460 --> 01:29:39.330
TALIESIN: I have no idea.

2469
01:29:39.330 --> 01:29:40.230
I don't know why I would know that.

2470
01:29:40.230 --> 01:29:41.330
SAM: It's got a name.

2471
01:29:41.330 --> 01:29:43.330
TALIESIN: I mean, does it look like a town?

2472
01:29:43.330 --> 01:29:44.610
MATT: It's hard to tell from this distance.

2473
01:29:44.610 --> 01:29:47.180
It's another hour of travel, full speed, to get there.

2474
01:29:47.180 --> 01:29:49.849
TALIESIN: That's turbulent.

2475
01:29:49.849 --> 01:29:52.451
Yeah, I mean...

2476
01:29:52.451 --> 01:29:53.980
We're just as likely to have something

2477
01:29:53.980 --> 01:29:55.144
bad happen out here, I suppose,

2478
01:29:55.144 --> 01:29:57.656
as if we get a little further.

2479
01:29:57.656 --> 01:30:00.906
I've got something in my pocket just in case.

2480
01:30:03.129 --> 01:30:03.962
TRAVIS: Stay or go?

2481
01:30:03.962 --> 01:30:05.607
What do you think?

2482
01:30:05.607 --> 01:30:07.408
(sighing)

2483
01:30:07.408 --> 01:30:09.091
ASHLEY: I mean, of course I would be fine

2484
01:30:09.091 --> 01:30:12.162
with pressing on, but I know for some of you,

2485
01:30:12.162 --> 01:30:14.570
that might not be wise.

2486
01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:16.722
TRAVIS: Well, let's stop.

2487
01:30:16.722 --> 01:30:18.440
We've been riding a thin line.

2488
01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:19.941
SAM: What, no? No!

2489
01:30:19.941 --> 01:30:24.056
We have a mission that we have to complete.

2490
01:30:24.056 --> 01:30:26.360
ASHLEY: Yeah, but if we all die before we even get

2491
01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:27.710
to complete that mission...

2492
01:30:29.970 --> 01:30:30.803
SAM: Fair.

2493
01:30:30.803 --> 01:30:31.800
TALIESIN: Is there anywhere around that looks

2494
01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:34.920
like a good place to bed in for the night, or no?

2495
01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:38.910
MATT: There's no caverns.

2496
01:30:38.910 --> 01:30:41.663
LAURA: It's only an hour?
ALL: It's only an hour.

2497
01:30:41.663 --> 01:30:42.600
MATT: It's open fields here until you get

2498
01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:44.260
to the base of the Penumbra Range.

2499
01:30:44.260 --> 01:30:45.480
TALIESIN: There's a giant bird.

2500
01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:47.764
I've got a Daylight spell just in case.

2501
01:30:47.764 --> 01:30:50.371
I just say we--
TRAVIS: Drive it?

2502
01:30:50.371 --> 01:30:51.221
TALIESIN: Personally.

2503
01:30:51.221 --> 01:30:54.190
TRAVIS: Let's go. Let's do it. Commit.

2504
01:30:54.190 --> 01:30:55.667
TALIESIN: Are we still in the badlands?

2505
01:30:55.667 --> 01:30:58.367
MATT: You're in the cusp of the Barbed Fields.

2506
01:30:59.509 --> 01:31:01.060
MARISHA: We can also, instead of going full speed ahead,

2507
01:31:01.060 --> 01:31:03.910
just try and go super stealthy and take extra time.

2508
01:31:03.910 --> 01:31:06.715
MATT: You can take two hours and go stealthily if you like.

2509
01:31:06.715 --> 01:31:08.890
LIAM: Caduceus, don't waste your reserves.

2510
01:31:08.890 --> 01:31:10.720
I have that globe, can do the same thing.

2511
01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:11.760
TALIESIN: Okay.

2512
01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:13.210
I've got a little bit of magic left.

2513
01:31:13.210 --> 01:31:15.247
Not a lot, but a little bit.

2514
01:31:15.247 --> 01:31:19.858
LAURA: I have a few.

2515
01:31:19.858 --> 01:31:21.740
Three spells left.
TRAVIS: Hey!

2516
01:31:21.740 --> 01:31:23.270
TALIESIN: That's something.

2517
01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:24.730
MATT: Full speed, take an hour?

2518
01:31:24.730 --> 01:31:26.296
Slow speed, stealthily, take two hours?

2519
01:31:26.296 --> 01:31:30.040
LIAM: Full speed or not at all.
TRAVIS: Full speed or not at all

2520
01:31:30.040 --> 01:31:31.300
MATT: All right, full speed.

2521
01:31:31.300 --> 01:31:32.577
Everybody please make a constitution

2522
01:31:32.577 --> 01:31:34.180
saving throw for me, please.

2523
01:31:34.180 --> 01:31:35.677
TRAVIS: Constitution?
MATT: Yes.

2524
01:31:35.677 --> 01:31:36.510
SAM: For exhaustion.

2525
01:31:36.510 --> 01:31:40.268
MATT: You're pushing on the extra hour of full movement.

2526
01:31:40.268 --> 01:31:41.101
SAM: 17.

2527
01:31:41.101 --> 01:31:42.284
TRAVIS: Don't fuck me, Gil!

2528
01:31:43.426 --> 01:31:44.850
TALIESIN: You get a...

2529
01:31:44.850 --> 01:31:46.916
Is it a plus one on saves?

2530
01:31:46.916 --> 01:31:48.541
TRAVIS: 17.

2531
01:31:48.541 --> 01:31:50.342
MARISHA: 16.
LIAM: 18.

2532
01:31:51.290 --> 01:31:52.500
MATT: Aww.
LIAM: Oh!

2533
01:31:52.500 --> 01:31:54.230
TALIESIN: 20.
ASHLEY: Ten.

2534
01:31:54.230 --> 01:31:56.150
MATT: Okay, Jester you're the one

2535
01:31:56.150 --> 01:31:59.255
who takes a point of exhaustion.

2536
01:31:59.255 --> 01:32:00.740
LAURA: Well, I said I was tired.

2537
01:32:00.740 --> 01:32:01.740
I said--
MATT: Yeah,

2538
01:32:01.740 --> 01:32:04.130
and potentially you're winded from the travel.

2539
01:32:04.130 --> 01:32:09.116
The intensity of the day's battles and being weary,

2540
01:32:09.116 --> 01:32:13.170
the shift in weather from extremely damp to extremely dry.

2541
01:32:14.450 --> 01:32:15.800
The winds are starting to collect

2542
01:32:15.800 --> 01:32:17.637
as you're getting closer to the city,

2543
01:32:17.637 --> 01:32:21.130
and a bit of dust is starting to pick up with them.

2544
01:32:23.388 --> 01:32:26.496
You guys slowly begin to make your way

2545
01:32:26.496 --> 01:32:29.213
towards Bazzoxan.

2546
01:32:29.213 --> 01:32:31.060
LAURA: Oh, stop it!

2547
01:32:31.060 --> 01:32:35.257
MATT: Now as you approach the jagged mountain cliffs

2548
01:32:35.257 --> 01:32:37.970
along the northern-most point of the Penumbra Range here,

2549
01:32:37.970 --> 01:32:40.110
flanked to the south by the barren and broken badlands

2550
01:32:40.110 --> 01:32:42.160
that you've just traversed,

2551
01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:45.020
your eyes catch dark spots against the ruddy rock

2552
01:32:45.020 --> 01:32:47.120
as the last bit of light begins to vanish.

2553
01:32:48.180 --> 01:32:52.073
You see sections of a giant, dark tower,

2554
01:32:53.023 --> 01:32:57.140
a temple of jet woven into the cliff side,

2555
01:32:57.140 --> 01:32:59.607
climbing towards the cloudy sky above,

2556
01:32:59.607 --> 01:33:02.740
entering and emerging from the rock in multiple places

2557
01:33:02.740 --> 01:33:05.920
like it's been built in and out of the mountain

2558
01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:08.166
as part of its structure.

2559
01:33:08.166 --> 01:33:10.876
As you draw even nearer, you can make out

2560
01:33:10.876 --> 01:33:13.180
the spire-like towers that emerge from this temple,

2561
01:33:13.180 --> 01:33:15.130
a series of smaller little crests

2562
01:33:15.130 --> 01:33:16.270
that seem to emerge with their own

2563
01:33:16.270 --> 01:33:20.918
little platforms and alcoves and balconies on them.

2564
01:33:22.226 --> 01:33:24.580
It looks like someone took an elaborate stronghold

2565
01:33:24.580 --> 01:33:26.470
and then merged it with a mountainside,

2566
01:33:26.470 --> 01:33:28.680
kind of Philadelphia Experiment-wise,

2567
01:33:28.680 --> 01:33:31.000
and only sections of it are emerging from the rock.

2568
01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:34.290
You can see some of them appear to be crumbled.

2569
01:33:34.290 --> 01:33:36.646
Some still stand.

2570
01:33:36.646 --> 01:33:40.590
At its base, you see what you assume is Bazzoxan.

2571
01:33:40.590 --> 01:33:45.432
It is a series of scattered structures, a large village.

2572
01:33:45.432 --> 01:33:50.432
Not a city, but a village, constructed among ruins,

2573
01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:53.930
similar to the Ghostlands on the outside of Rosohna,

2574
01:33:53.930 --> 01:33:56.270
but much, much, much smaller.

2575
01:33:56.270 --> 01:33:58.760
You can see buildings that have fallen and toppled,

2576
01:33:58.760 --> 01:34:01.010
but amongst them you see newer structures

2577
01:34:01.010 --> 01:34:04.818
that are in construction or have been built.

2578
01:34:05.830 --> 01:34:07.330
You can see some that are partially erected

2579
01:34:07.330 --> 01:34:08.300
with teams that are starting

2580
01:34:08.300 --> 01:34:10.812
to finish their work for the day.

2581
01:34:10.812 --> 01:34:12.680
You can see street corners that are marked

2582
01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:15.360
with large, iron watchtowers that are set

2583
01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:16.960
on the perimeter of the village.

2584
01:34:17.850 --> 01:34:19.781
You also begin to see, as you get closer still,

2585
01:34:19.781 --> 01:34:23.528
the presence of Aurora Watch soldiers from the Dynasty.

2586
01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:28.650
In fact, most of the people you see here are armored.

2587
01:34:28.650 --> 01:34:32.314
You don't see a lot of village folk.

2588
01:34:32.314 --> 01:34:34.220
You don't see a lot of civilians,

2589
01:34:34.220 --> 01:34:36.090
most a primarily military presence.

2590
01:34:38.514 --> 01:34:39.800
The wind picks up a little stronger

2591
01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:41.400
and dust begins to blow through.

2592
01:34:44.302 --> 01:34:45.640
At that point you begin to see

2593
01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:48.630
a group of about seven

2594
01:34:48.630 --> 01:34:51.722
of these armored figures notice your arrival

2595
01:34:51.722 --> 01:34:54.121
and begin to walk in your direction.

2596
01:34:54.121 --> 01:34:55.149
LIAM: Already pulling out.

2597
01:34:55.149 --> 01:34:56.030
Go for it.

2598
01:34:56.030 --> 01:34:58.303
MATT: That's where we'll take our break.

2599
01:34:58.303 --> 01:34:59.461
TRAVIS: Already pulling out your--

2600
01:34:59.461 --> 01:35:01.527
LIAM: Fireball!

2601
01:35:01.527 --> 01:35:03.200
(explosion)

2602
01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:04.050
TALIESIN: I'll throw everything.

2603
01:35:04.050 --> 01:35:05.397
LAURA: Travis, where's that bag?

2604
01:35:06.330 --> 01:35:07.895
TRAVIS: It's in there.
LAURA: It's in there?

2605
01:35:07.895 --> 01:35:09.240
MATT: We'll return here in just a moment

2606
01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:10.800
with the arrival to Bazzoxan

2607
01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:13.540
and see what that entails as you approach--

2608
01:35:13.540 --> 01:35:15.680
LIAM: Ooh, welcome to Bazzoxan!

2609
01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:17.100
TRAVIS: Spires of jet, you said?

2610
01:35:17.100 --> 01:35:18.620
So black?
LIAM: Yeah.

2611
01:35:18.620 --> 01:35:21.580
MATT: Like just pitch black stone

2612
01:35:21.580 --> 01:35:22.413
that just...

2613
01:35:22.413 --> 01:35:24.990
It looks somewhat polished in places,

2614
01:35:24.990 --> 01:35:26.450
but others are scarred and pockmarked.

2615
01:35:26.450 --> 01:35:28.542
It looks old. It's ancient.

2616
01:35:28.542 --> 01:35:30.285
TRAVIS: Does it match the color of the stuff behind it,

2617
01:35:30.285 --> 01:35:32.326
the ridge behind it?

2618
01:35:32.326 --> 01:35:35.651
MATT: No. The stone is more of a--

2619
01:35:35.651 --> 01:35:36.952
TRAVIS: Not obsidian, but like--

2620
01:35:36.952 --> 01:35:41.030
MATT: No, it's like a dull maroon-gray mixture.

2621
01:35:41.030 --> 01:35:42.084
It's the same color as the spires,

2622
01:35:42.084 --> 01:35:45.640
of the various barbs along the fields,

2623
01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:47.700
where most of the ground is a deep,

2624
01:35:47.700 --> 01:35:50.340
ruddy red, clay earth,

2625
01:35:50.340 --> 01:35:52.340
the spires themselves are more of a deep gray.

2626
01:35:52.340 --> 01:35:54.200
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, that's making my spider sense tingle.

2627
01:35:55.297 --> 01:35:56.380
SAM: Your spire sense.

2628
01:35:56.380 --> 01:35:57.620
TALIESIN: My spire sense.
MATT: Your spire sense.

2629
01:35:57.620 --> 01:36:00.860
So we have our Wyrmwood giveaway for the break,

2630
01:36:00.860 --> 01:36:02.977
our fantastic, purpleheart wood tabletop tray.

2631
01:36:02.977 --> 01:36:04.320
(cheering)

2632
01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:06.909
So purty.
SAM: I love it.

2633
01:36:08.317 --> 01:36:09.980
MATT: We're going to give this away to one lucky winner.

2634
01:36:09.980 --> 01:36:13.100
To enter, go ahead and, in our Twitch chat here,

2635
01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:16.010
enter in the word delve, D-E-L-V-E.

2636
01:36:16.010 --> 01:36:17.466
TRAVIS: and MATT: Delve.

2637
01:36:17.466 --> 01:36:18.540
SAM: Awesome.

2638
01:36:19.715 --> 01:36:20.712
MATT: We want it only once.

2639
01:36:20.712 --> 01:36:21.660
More than once and you'll be disqualified.

2640
01:36:21.660 --> 01:36:22.910
We'll have one winner in return.

2641
01:36:22.910 --> 01:36:25.510
Of course, for US and Canada, excluding Quebec.

2642
01:36:25.510 --> 01:36:27.004
We'll see you guys in a few minutes.

2643
01:36:27.004 --> 01:36:29.314
LIAM: That was a good 90 minutes.

2644
01:36:29.314 --> 01:36:31.029

(angelic music)

2665
01:37:34.856 --> 01:37:37.356
(tense music)

2666
01:37:43.525 --> 01:37:46.245
(gasps)
BRIAN: Hello, Christina.

2667
01:37:46.245 --> 01:37:51.245
Tell me your backstory.
(dramatic music)

2668
01:37:59.021 --> 01:38:04.021
Have you always wanted to be a voice actor?

2669
01:38:06.074 --> 01:38:07.724
(gasps)

2670
01:38:07.724 --> 01:38:09.721
CHRISTINA: He's here.
BRIAN: Who's here?

2671
01:38:09.721 --> 01:38:14.721
(screams)
(bright swing music)

2672
01:38:23.260 --> 01:38:25.690
BRIAN (VO): Last time on Talks Machina.

2673
01:38:25.690 --> 01:38:27.820
BRIAN: Travis, Holyflavor wants to know--

2674
01:38:27.820 --> 01:38:28.690
TRAVIS: Holyflavor?

2675
01:38:28.690 --> 01:38:31.550
BRIAN: What is the holiest of flavors?

2676
01:38:31.550 --> 01:38:33.010
Pepperoni?
TRAVIS: Cinnamon.

2677
01:38:33.010 --> 01:38:35.117
BRIAN: Cinnamon?

2678
01:38:35.117 --> 01:38:37.158
TRAVIS: You can put it in pasta.

2679
01:38:37.158 --> 01:38:38.633
BRIAN: Oh, Travis.

2680
01:38:38.633 --> 01:38:40.770
Does Fjord think the deity in his dream was the Wildmother?

2681
01:38:40.770 --> 01:38:42.540
If yes, does he intent to tell Clay?

2682
01:38:42.540 --> 01:38:43.770
BRIAN: You don't have to answer the second part

2683
01:38:43.770 --> 01:38:44.680
if you don't want to.

2684
01:38:44.680 --> 01:38:46.990
We don't like questions about what people intend to do.

2685
01:38:46.990 --> 01:38:48.950
TRAVIS: Well, in the middle of it when he was like

2686
01:38:48.950 --> 01:38:51.160
you hear a motherly voice, I was like (gasps).

2687
01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:52.710
Fjord's mom?

2688
01:38:52.710 --> 01:38:53.793
MARISHA: Oh no!

2689
01:38:53.793 --> 01:38:55.992
TRAVIS: Nope, not what was happening.

2690
01:38:55.992 --> 01:38:56.980
MARISHA: Oh.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2691
01:38:56.980 --> 01:39:00.623
I mean, unless Fjord is Wildmother bae.

2692
01:39:00.623 --> 01:39:01.980
(laughter)

2693
01:39:01.980 --> 01:39:02.813
Could be.

2694
01:39:02.813 --> 01:39:03.840
Could be the babe.

2695
01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:04.673
No.

2696
01:39:05.970 --> 01:39:07.091
Think it was the Wildmother,

2697
01:39:07.091 --> 01:39:09.860
definitely going to Caduceus about it.

2698
01:39:09.860 --> 01:39:11.580
BRIAN: Okay.
TRAVIS: Yeah, for sure.

2699
01:39:11.580 --> 01:39:13.340
Yeah, I mean anybody that can interrupt

2700
01:39:13.340 --> 01:39:15.240
that signal or the act

2701
01:39:15.240 --> 01:39:17.610
of said arcane powers being taken away--

2702
01:39:17.610 --> 01:39:18.470
MARISHA: Yeah, that was a big deal.

2703
01:39:18.470 --> 01:39:20.280
DANI: It was such a big deal.
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's a big deal!

2704
01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:22.880
DANI: It's such a big deal!
BRIAN: Huge deal.

2705
01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:25.360
MARISHA: Then do you just hang out near a giant tree

2706
01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:26.410
in the middle of a wasteland?

2707
01:39:26.410 --> 01:39:27.460
TRAVIS: I'll fucking sip some tea.

2708
01:39:27.460 --> 01:39:28.830
I don't give a shit, right?

2709
01:39:28.830 --> 01:39:31.570
I'll help him turn dead people into fungus.

2710
01:39:31.570 --> 01:39:32.403
I'll grow some smurfs.

2711
01:39:32.403 --> 01:39:34.228
DANI: "Withers without faith," Travis.

2712
01:39:34.228 --> 01:39:36.735
TRAVIS: Look, I will start wearing pastels, okay?

2713
01:39:36.735 --> 01:39:37.730
It's worked for Caduceus.

2714
01:39:37.730 --> 01:39:39.736
I will get fluorescent up in this bitch.

2715
01:39:39.736 --> 01:39:40.910
(laughter)

2716
01:39:40.910 --> 01:39:43.979
BRIAN: Our winner for this week was sent

2717
01:39:43.979 --> 01:39:48.628
in by Stephanie, @Teaandtrials.

2718
01:39:48.628 --> 01:39:50.973
Nope, @Teaandtails.

2719
01:39:50.973 --> 01:39:55.910
(laughter)
Photo by Jay Villanueva.

2720
01:39:56.790 --> 01:39:59.087
Let's take a look.
TRAVIS: Nope.

2721
01:39:59.087 --> 01:40:02.553
Oh, yeah!
DANI: So good!

2722
01:40:02.553 --> 01:40:04.610
MARISHA: She's so pretty!
BRIAN: A little Vox Machina.

2723
01:40:04.610 --> 01:40:07.510
Spoilers, this is from campaign one of Critical Role.

2724
01:40:07.510 --> 01:40:09.610
DANI: Those antlers are huge, too.

2725
01:40:09.610 --> 01:40:12.376
MARISHA: So good!

2726
01:40:13.485 --> 01:40:15.010
Love that tattoo work.

2727
01:40:15.010 --> 01:40:17.090
BRIAN: Then there's a second photo.
MARISHA and TRAVIS: Ooh!

2728
01:40:17.090 --> 01:40:19.239
BRIAN: Wow!

2729
01:40:19.239 --> 01:40:20.270
MARISHA: Amazing.

2730
01:40:20.270 --> 01:40:21.870
BRIAN: How did Beau feel about sharing

2731
01:40:21.870 --> 01:40:23.508
that piece of her story with Yasha?

2732
01:40:23.508 --> 01:40:25.130
Did she do it because she wanted

2733
01:40:25.130 --> 01:40:26.760
to comfort Yasha about her past,

2734
01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:28.580
or did she think of it as an opportunity

2735
01:40:28.580 --> 01:40:30.912
to share her pain with someone who understands?

2736
01:40:32.029 --> 01:40:34.420
MARISHA: More the latter.
BRIAN: Yeah.

2737
01:40:34.420 --> 01:40:35.253
MARISHA: Yeah.

2738
01:40:35.253 --> 01:40:37.570
Beau's not a comforter,

2739
01:40:38.690 --> 01:40:40.490
literally and figuratively.

2740
01:40:41.453 --> 01:40:42.730
BRIAN: Was that a joke

2741
01:40:42.730 --> 01:40:44.294
about her not being a blanket basically?

2742
01:40:44.294 --> 01:40:45.930
MARISHA: (laughs) Yes, it was.

2743
01:40:45.930 --> 01:40:48.670
BRIAN: Boy, I've said some bad ones.

2744
01:40:48.670 --> 01:40:49.970
MARISHA: I was trying to just roll past it.

2745
01:40:49.970 --> 01:40:50.910
BRIAN: I love it.

2746
01:40:50.910 --> 01:40:53.440
I wouldn't let you.
(laughs)

2747
01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:55.060
That's my job.

2748
01:40:55.060 --> 01:40:57.099
No one gets away with shit on this show.

2749
01:40:57.099 --> 01:40:58.767
Anyway, yeah.

2750
01:40:58.767 --> 01:40:59.920
MARISHA: Yeah, no, I've been thinking

2751
01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:01.688
about it for the past few weeks,

2752
01:41:01.688 --> 01:41:04.910
and I just saw it as an opportunity.

2753
01:41:04.910 --> 01:41:08.460
But once again, I wasn't going to do it in front of people.

2754
01:41:08.460 --> 01:41:10.677
I'm just going to wait because--

2755
01:41:10.677 --> 01:41:12.220
BRIAN: Because it might have turned into something cool.

2756
01:41:12.220 --> 01:41:13.290
(laughs) You don't want other people

2757
01:41:13.290 --> 01:41:14.590
around you have to kick out.

2758
01:41:14.590 --> 01:41:17.400
MARISHA: Man, that bubble, I bet it's echoey.

2759
01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:18.233
TRAVIS: Yeah, I mean it's true.

2760
01:41:18.233 --> 01:41:20.050
Like 65 episodes in we're still making

2761
01:41:20.050 --> 01:41:22.140
the little personal inroads to each other.

2762
01:41:22.140 --> 01:41:26.582
It's not full share moments.
MARISHA: No.

2763
01:41:26.582 --> 01:41:29.110
By the time we were Vox Machina,

2764
01:41:29.110 --> 01:41:30.390
we'd already been playing for two years.

2765
01:41:30.390 --> 01:41:32.220
TRAVIS: We were like level seven, eight?

2766
01:41:32.220 --> 01:41:33.053
MARISHA: Seven.
TRAVIS: Yeah, fuck.

2767
01:41:33.053 --> 01:41:35.601
MARISHA: Which is just a little over where we are now.

2768
01:41:35.601 --> 01:41:38.940
Or we're over that now, so...

2769
01:41:38.940 --> 01:41:39.773
BRIAN: That's crazy.

2770
01:41:39.773 --> 01:41:42.340
TRAVIS: Yeah, I mean she saved his life.

2771
01:41:42.340 --> 01:41:45.660
He was getting attacked by Edward Scissorhands

2772
01:41:45.660 --> 01:41:47.440
meets Baraka from Mortal Kombat.

2773
01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:49.436
There was bad stuff going on.

2774
01:41:49.436 --> 01:41:51.190
BRIAN: And all you could do to repay her

2775
01:41:51.190 --> 01:41:53.280
was a measly kiss on the cheek?

2776
01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:54.488
TRAVIS: Well, we were

2777
01:41:54.488 --> 01:41:56.230
in the middle of a life or death struggle.

2778
01:41:56.230 --> 01:41:57.800
I figured the nicest thing to do

2779
01:41:57.800 --> 01:41:59.520
is to be like, "Oh, thank you. (kiss)

2780
01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:00.353
"See ya.

2781
01:42:00.353 --> 01:42:01.978
"Let's kick some ass," right?

2782
01:42:03.377 --> 01:42:04.717
(laughter)

2783
01:42:04.717 --> 01:42:07.347
BRIAN: Don't look to Dani when I--
DANI: Why are you looking at me?

2784
01:42:07.347 --> 01:42:09.420
BRIAN: What just happened was--
DANI: What did I do?

2785
01:42:09.420 --> 01:42:10.830
BRIAN: Travis looks at me and said,

2786
01:42:10.830 --> 01:42:12.270
"Dad, can I have another cookie?"

2787
01:42:12.270 --> 01:42:14.549
And I said "Nope," and so you looked at Dani.

2788
01:42:14.549 --> 01:42:16.068
(laughter)

2789
01:42:16.068 --> 01:42:18.076
TRAVIS: It's chilly in here, Jeb.

2790
01:42:18.076 --> 01:42:21.202
Can we turn down the thermostat a wee bit?

2791
01:42:22.450 --> 01:42:27.450
What is My Little Pony one-shot for $400.

2792
01:42:27.511 --> 01:42:29.844
(laughter)

2793
01:42:31.003 --> 01:42:32.730
ASHLEY: Sometimes looking back I'm like, "Oh,

2794
01:42:32.730 --> 01:42:36.034
"that was not a normal upbringing, but it was fun."

2795
01:42:36.034 --> 01:42:39.929
My parents, we had a party house.

2796
01:42:39.929 --> 01:42:41.600
BRIAN: Yeah, everybody tells stories

2797
01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:43.220
about you kids going to bed and going

2798
01:42:43.220 --> 01:42:45.433
can you guys keep it down?
ASHLEY: (laughs) Yeah.

2799
01:42:45.433 --> 01:42:47.380
My parents would stay up...

2800
01:42:47.380 --> 01:42:48.560
I mean, my mom still--

2801
01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:49.610
BRIAN: Your mom still stays up and watches--

2802
01:42:49.610 --> 01:42:52.490
ASHLEY: She stays up till three o'clock in the morning,

2803
01:42:52.490 --> 01:42:55.367
and we had people over all the time.

2804
01:42:55.367 --> 01:42:58.540
We would play music and watch movies,

2805
01:42:58.540 --> 01:43:01.627
and it was a really fun house.

2806
01:43:02.894 --> 01:43:05.520
When I look back on my upbringing,

2807
01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:08.756
I'm not thinking about the projects that I did.

2808
01:43:08.756 --> 01:43:12.330
It's not measured by "Oh, that's when I was working on this,

2809
01:43:12.330 --> 01:43:13.720
"or that's when I was working on this."

2810
01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:16.520
It's more about the life experiences that I had,

2811
01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:18.120
and I think that's a positive thing.

2812
01:43:18.120 --> 01:43:19.015
BRIAN: Those are the milestones you remember.

2813
01:43:19.015 --> 01:43:19.848
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2814
01:43:19.848 --> 01:43:22.931
(bright swing music)

2815
01:43:31.100 --> 01:43:33.890
LIAM: Subscribe,

2816
01:43:33.890 --> 01:43:35.898
or don't subscribe.

2817
01:43:37.672 --> 01:43:39.965
(sighs) That's not a question.

2818
01:43:42.010 --> 01:43:43.870
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind

2819
01:43:43.870 --> 01:43:48.870
to ponder the pros and more pros of Twitch or Twitch Prime,

2820
01:43:49.444 --> 01:43:52.560
or to take hands and gift new subs

2821
01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:55.530
to Critters who find they can't afford them,

2822
01:43:56.930 --> 01:43:58.263
to play,

2823
01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:02.100
to sleep

2824
01:44:03.630 --> 01:44:04.888
no more.

2825
01:44:06.340 --> 01:44:08.900
And by asleep to say the cast and crew

2826
01:44:08.900 --> 01:44:10.880
of Critical Role might find their naps

2827
01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:13.813
around the hectic schedule of a live broadcast

2828
01:44:13.813 --> 01:44:16.680
that we have brought for your consumption,

2829
01:44:16.680 --> 01:44:19.608
both Critter and fan alike.

2830
01:44:21.950 --> 01:44:25.282
To play or sleep.

2831
01:44:26.699 --> 01:44:30.149
(chuckles) No sleep,

2832
01:44:30.149 --> 01:44:32.565
but just to stream.

2833
01:44:33.990 --> 01:44:35.830
Aye, there's the rub.

2834
01:44:36.770 --> 01:44:41.767
For with your subscription, what streams may come.

2835
01:44:44.821 --> 01:44:47.950
Oh man, oh man, that is a fucking tagline.

2836
01:44:47.950 --> 01:44:49.566
We got that?

2837
01:44:51.131 --> 01:44:52.598
That is Twitch poetry.

2838
01:44:53.704 --> 01:44:55.010
(grunts)

2839
01:44:55.010 --> 01:44:59.000
Oh, anyway, subscribe to Critical Role.

2840
01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.080
Use Twitch Prime to subscribe.

2841
01:45:01.080 --> 01:45:02.630
Gift some subscriptions.

2842
01:45:03.487 --> 01:45:05.028
You got it.

2843
01:45:05.028 --> 01:45:07.274
(inhales sharply)

2844
01:45:07.274 --> 01:45:09.790
Mm, wrong soliloquy for the skull,

2845
01:45:09.790 --> 01:45:13.622
but that's fucking good.

2846
01:45:13.622 --> 01:45:17.122
(bright orchestral music)

2847
01:45:19.461 --> 01:45:22.211
(dramatic music)

2848
01:58:03.760 --> 01:58:05.129
MATT: Welcome back.

2849
01:58:05.129 --> 01:58:07.680
We have our winner of the giveaway.

2850
01:58:07.680 --> 01:58:11.050
The winner is Kmell86.

2851
01:58:11.050 --> 01:58:12.798
Kmell86, congratulations.

2852
01:58:12.798 --> 01:58:15.370
K-M-E-L-L 86.

2853
01:58:15.370 --> 01:58:19.076
We'll get your winning dice box to you ASAP.

2854
01:58:20.670 --> 01:58:21.800
Laura will be joining us in just a moment.

2855
01:58:21.800 --> 01:58:23.190
She's finishing up there.

2856
01:58:23.190 --> 01:58:25.800
TALIESIN: You cover your own thing.

2857
01:58:25.800 --> 01:58:27.320
MATT: So--
TALIESIN: Fancy.

2858
01:58:27.320 --> 01:58:29.730
MATT: As you guys are on moorbounders

2859
01:58:29.730 --> 01:58:31.670
slowing down the pace of your arrival

2860
01:58:31.670 --> 01:58:33.201
as you watch these figures approach

2861
01:58:33.201 --> 01:58:35.651
from the outskirts of Bazzoxan,

2862
01:58:35.651 --> 01:58:39.604
the daylight now primarily entirely vanished

2863
01:58:39.604 --> 01:58:41.740
other than the faint glimmer

2864
01:58:41.740 --> 01:58:45.123
of remaining sunset light on the top of the range.

2865
01:58:45.123 --> 01:58:47.460
What do you want to do to prepare for their arrival?

2866
01:58:47.460 --> 01:58:50.642
LIAM: I am casting Dancing Light so the globules of light

2867
01:58:50.642 --> 01:58:53.630
are rotating around Beauregard and Nott and me

2868
01:58:53.630 --> 01:58:55.903
so that this badge can be seen.

2869
01:58:55.903 --> 01:58:58.392
MATT: Okay.

2870
01:58:58.392 --> 01:58:59.452
SAM: This since Dynasty?

2871
01:58:59.452 --> 01:59:00.568
LIAM: Yeah.

2872
01:59:03.030 --> 01:59:05.863
MARISHA: I'll cloak up as well.

2873
01:59:05.863 --> 01:59:07.976
MATT: Fjord, anything?

2874
01:59:07.976 --> 01:59:10.712
TRAVIS: (sighs) Do I cast Friends on myself?

2875
01:59:10.712 --> 01:59:12.760
No, but then they know it afterwards.

2876
01:59:12.760 --> 01:59:14.391
We don't want to do that just yet.

2877
01:59:14.391 --> 01:59:15.750
I will...

2878
01:59:17.707 --> 01:59:19.548
Nope, nothing.

2879
01:59:19.548 --> 01:59:20.640
MATT: Okay.

2880
01:59:20.640 --> 01:59:21.510
SAM: Nothing here either.

2881
01:59:21.510 --> 01:59:23.440
I'm just going to be loud and proud.

2882
01:59:23.440 --> 01:59:25.605
LIAM: Leaving it all up to Jester.

2883
01:59:25.605 --> 01:59:27.130
MATT: About 80 or so feet out,

2884
01:59:27.130 --> 01:59:31.050
six of them all pull out variations

2885
01:59:31.050 --> 01:59:33.450
of heavy crossbows, longbows,

2886
01:59:33.450 --> 01:59:36.298
and just go ahead and get them ready.

2887
01:59:37.290 --> 01:59:38.747
TALIESIN: They're not aiming, though?

2888
01:59:38.747 --> 01:59:40.250
MATT: They're not aiming them yet.

2889
01:59:40.250 --> 01:59:42.453
They're keeping them at the side.

2890
01:59:42.453 --> 01:59:44.420
The one in the center, who you can see

2891
01:59:44.420 --> 01:59:46.738
on the armor has a small,

2892
01:59:46.738 --> 01:59:49.240
red sash that goes over one shoulder

2893
01:59:49.240 --> 01:59:51.700
and then dangles across the front of the armor approaches

2894
01:59:51.700 --> 01:59:54.370
and puts ahead forward to the rest of you,

2895
01:59:54.370 --> 01:59:58.330
putting a hand up. "(speaks Undercommon)"

2896
01:59:58.330 --> 02:00:00.550
LIAM: Please give us a chance to speak.

2897
02:00:00.550 --> 02:00:02.600
We are friend of the Bright Queen,

2898
02:00:03.992 --> 02:00:06.240
all of us.
MATT: "Step forward."

2899
02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:10.060
LIAM: I slide down off of Jannik

2900
02:00:10.934 --> 02:00:13.250
and start to walk forward holding the medallion.

2901
02:00:13.250 --> 02:00:15.360
MATT: Okay, as you take a few steps forward,

2902
02:00:15.360 --> 02:00:17.830
some of them get their weapons ready,

2903
02:00:19.066 --> 02:00:20.720
takes a few steps and meets--

2904
02:00:20.720 --> 02:00:21.553
LIAM: My hand up in the air.

2905
02:00:21.553 --> 02:00:25.680
MATT: Meets you part way, looks to you.

2906
02:00:25.680 --> 02:00:27.944
You can see underneath the helmet,

2907
02:00:27.944 --> 02:00:29.950
the eyes are not trusting.

2908
02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:33.080
You can see from the chin there's a bit

2909
02:00:33.080 --> 02:00:36.650
of a heavy, gray chin beard

2910
02:00:36.650 --> 02:00:37.990
that comes to a gradual point.

2911
02:00:37.990 --> 02:00:42.150
It's an older drow, weathered,

2912
02:00:43.010 --> 02:00:46.100
and all the armor here looks like of weathered

2913
02:00:46.100 --> 02:00:48.310
in comparison to the bright, polished armor

2914
02:00:48.310 --> 02:00:51.112
that you are used to seeing in Rosohna.

2915
02:00:51.112 --> 02:00:53.258
There's a general air of...

2916
02:00:54.638 --> 02:00:57.130
Those who've had to survive on the outskirts

2917
02:00:57.130 --> 02:00:59.970
of a less than positive environment

2918
02:00:59.970 --> 02:01:01.440
probably reside in this area

2919
02:01:01.440 --> 02:01:03.000
and you can see that immediately

2920
02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.050
across the soldiers that are in the area.

2921
02:01:06.684 --> 02:01:11.190
He looks you over, looks at your symbol.

2922
02:01:13.060 --> 02:01:13.893
"Might I?"

2923
02:01:15.620 --> 02:01:17.130
LIAM: I'm going to remove it from my neck.

2924
02:01:17.130 --> 02:01:18.030
Is that all right?

2925
02:01:25.950 --> 02:01:28.950
MATT: "And how would a human with a

2926
02:01:31.360 --> 02:01:35.620
"Zemnian accent come about the favor of the Bright Queen?"

2927
02:01:35.620 --> 02:01:38.140
LIAM: I know, it is a strange thing.

2928
02:01:38.140 --> 02:01:40.990
We are all a bit of a strange sight.

2929
02:01:40.990 --> 02:01:45.870
It is not a story that is told quickly.

2930
02:01:45.870 --> 02:01:47.390
MATT: "Then don't bother me with it.

2931
02:01:47.390 --> 02:01:49.240
"What is your purpose for being here?"

2932
02:01:49.240 --> 02:01:52.380
LIAM: Well, we have been sent north.

2933
02:01:55.390 --> 02:01:57.200
We work for the Bright Queen herself

2934
02:01:57.200 --> 02:02:00.200
and are also in league with...

2935
02:02:01.340 --> 02:02:05.618
Perhaps you have heard of a man named Essek of Den Thelyss.

2936
02:02:05.618 --> 02:02:07.980
MATT: "I am familiar with those of Thelyss."

2937
02:02:07.980 --> 02:02:09.690
LIAM: He also can vouch for us.

2938
02:02:11.202 --> 02:02:12.377
MATT: "Passing through,

2939
02:02:12.377 --> 02:02:13.770
"what is your business in the city, then?

2940
02:02:13.770 --> 02:02:16.060
"What is this?"

2941
02:02:16.060 --> 02:02:18.770
LIAM: We are searching for someone,

2942
02:02:19.845 --> 02:02:23.795
a possible enemy of the Dynasty.

2943
02:02:25.007 --> 02:02:29.370
We might not look it, but we are friends to the Dynasty.

2944
02:02:29.370 --> 02:02:31.340
MATT: Make a persuasion check with advantage.

2945
02:02:34.540 --> 02:02:35.373
SAM: Yeah!

2946
02:02:35.373 --> 02:02:36.623
LIAM: Dynasty dice!

2947
02:02:37.645 --> 02:02:39.270
Two 17s.

2948
02:02:39.270 --> 02:02:40.260
Two 17s.

2949
02:02:40.260 --> 02:02:42.100
TRAVIS: Comes out swinging with a left and a right.

2950
02:02:42.100 --> 02:02:43.734
LIAM: 21.

2951
02:02:43.734 --> 02:02:44.601
MATT: Gives a nod.

2952
02:02:44.601 --> 02:02:46.610
Looks over each of you.

2953
02:02:46.610 --> 02:02:48.750
His hand that's been up a hold pattern

2954
02:02:48.750 --> 02:02:51.490
just off to the side and down.

2955
02:02:51.490 --> 02:02:54.170
The weapons go back, the arrows are released

2956
02:02:54.170 --> 02:02:56.180
and placed back in their quivers.

2957
02:02:56.180 --> 02:02:58.040
The crossbows are unnocked.

2958
02:03:00.286 --> 02:03:02.070
"Well, you are welcome to stay.

2959
02:03:02.070 --> 02:03:05.930
"We are not a place for visitors often,

2960
02:03:05.930 --> 02:03:09.456
"so it is your responsibility to take care

2961
02:03:09.456 --> 02:03:14.456
"of you and your company, but welcome to Bazzoxan."

2962
02:03:15.156 --> 02:03:16.254
LIAM: Thank you.

2963
02:03:16.254 --> 02:03:18.890
We are obviously not from around these parts.

2964
02:03:18.890 --> 02:03:20.990
Do you have any advice for how

2965
02:03:20.990 --> 02:03:23.900
to not step out of line or cause any waves?

2966
02:03:23.900 --> 02:03:26.440
We want to abide.

2967
02:03:26.440 --> 02:03:28.650
MATT: "Be quiet, do your work, and leave."

2968
02:03:28.650 --> 02:03:30.690
LIAM: Understood.

2969
02:03:30.690 --> 02:03:32.690
MATT: Turns around and goes back to the other soldiers

2970
02:03:32.690 --> 02:03:34.670
and they all begin to slowly turn

2971
02:03:34.670 --> 02:03:36.640
and make their way back to the city.

2972
02:03:36.640 --> 02:03:39.400
Especially you folks who have darkvision

2973
02:03:39.400 --> 02:03:40.380
and can see from this distance

2974
02:03:40.380 --> 02:03:41.780
with a decent enough wisdom,

2975
02:03:43.318 --> 02:03:48.290
these are soldiers that have seen some shit. (laughs)

2976
02:03:50.050 --> 02:03:52.050
The reason they're less interested if you

2977
02:03:52.050 --> 02:03:54.310
is because you seem like less of a threat

2978
02:03:54.310 --> 02:03:56.200
than maybe some of the things they've deal with in the past.

2979
02:03:56.200 --> 02:03:58.726
TRAVIS: A giant, 200-foot wide roc.
MATT: Maybe.

2980
02:03:58.726 --> 02:04:03.363
Anyway, you can see there are a few lights

2981
02:04:03.363 --> 02:04:08.159
throughout the city that signify

2982
02:04:08.159 --> 02:04:10.390
the various towers in some corners,

2983
02:04:10.390 --> 02:04:11.530
but a lot of the city's in darkness

2984
02:04:11.530 --> 02:04:12.940
as it seems that many of the folks

2985
02:04:12.940 --> 02:04:15.229
that reside here are drow

2986
02:04:15.229 --> 02:04:19.000
and have not an extreme need for that much light.

2987
02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:20.980
But Bazzoxan lies before you.

2988
02:04:20.980 --> 02:04:22.340
What would you like to do?

2989
02:04:22.340 --> 02:04:23.890
TALIESIN: Let's find a place to turn in for the night,

2990
02:04:23.890 --> 02:04:27.408
somewhere that the creatures will be safe,

2991
02:04:27.408 --> 02:04:31.191
because we've got some very unruly friends

2992
02:04:31.191 --> 02:04:33.620
that we're riding in on.

2993
02:04:33.620 --> 02:04:35.355
LIAM: The little pale globules are just sort

2994
02:04:35.355 --> 02:04:38.215
of bubbling in the air around us in a circle.

2995
02:04:39.371 --> 02:04:41.840
SAM: We need a place to stay, but this is probably not

2996
02:04:41.840 --> 02:04:45.460
where we're going to find Obann, right?

2997
02:04:46.740 --> 02:04:48.850
LAURA: I mean, he might be in the mountains

2998
02:04:48.850 --> 02:04:51.156
if what I saw was true.

2999
02:04:51.156 --> 02:04:54.330
LIAM: We're certainly not going to go any further now.

3000
02:04:54.330 --> 02:04:55.560
LAURA: You can't find that entrance

3001
02:04:55.560 --> 02:04:58.090
or whatever it was he was looking for in the dark.

3002
02:04:59.007 --> 02:05:00.950
TALIESIN: Mm, we need to rest.
LIAM: Yeah.

3003
02:05:00.950 --> 02:05:04.670
You have been our best bet in trying to find this Obann,

3004
02:05:04.670 --> 02:05:09.170
so perhaps we count our losses and blessings

3005
02:05:09.170 --> 02:05:12.590
and bed down for the night and try again tomorrow, Jester?

3006
02:05:12.590 --> 02:05:13.710
LAURA: Sure, yeah, yeah.

3007
02:05:14.730 --> 02:05:19.669
I'm pretty tired, so I could do that.

3008
02:05:19.669 --> 02:05:21.400
LIAM: We made it.
LAURA: Hey, guys!

3009
02:05:21.400 --> 02:05:23.320
We're not dead.
SAM: We did it!

3010
02:05:23.320 --> 02:05:26.101
LAURA: We didn't get killed by a giant bird.

3011
02:05:26.101 --> 02:05:27.245
TALIESIN: Yeah!

3012
02:05:27.245 --> 02:05:30.702
LAURA: Or those things that almost killed Fjord,

3013
02:05:30.702 --> 02:05:33.542
or those other things that almost killed Fjord.

3014
02:05:33.542 --> 02:05:35.841
(laughter)

3015
02:05:35.841 --> 02:05:37.410
MATT: (screeches)

3016
02:05:37.410 --> 02:05:39.170
MARISHA: You were pretty awesome, actually.

3017
02:05:39.170 --> 02:05:40.221
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Yeah.

3018
02:05:40.221 --> 02:05:41.140
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3019
02:05:41.140 --> 02:05:43.982
LAURA: Me?!

3020
02:05:43.982 --> 02:05:46.407
ASHLEY: I do like this leaf look.

3021
02:05:46.407 --> 02:05:48.545
LAURA: (laughs) Oh, this one?

3022
02:05:48.545 --> 02:05:50.820
I cast Disguise Self again and put it on.

3023
02:05:50.820 --> 02:05:52.720
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's good.

3024
02:05:53.810 --> 02:05:56.000
SAM: Oh, you're a leaf!

3025
02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:59.510
Oh, now it makes way more sense.

3026
02:05:59.510 --> 02:06:00.720
(laughter)

3027
02:06:00.720 --> 02:06:02.560
I didn't what you were!

3028
02:06:02.560 --> 02:06:04.220
I was like, is she a lizard?

3029
02:06:04.220 --> 02:06:06.660
Is she some sort of a cobra snake or something?

3030
02:06:06.660 --> 02:06:07.493
LAURA: I was falling,

3031
02:06:07.493 --> 02:06:08.884
so it was hard to make out the details.

3032
02:06:08.884 --> 02:06:09.890
SAM: I had no idea.

3033
02:06:09.890 --> 02:06:11.210
I was trying to think about it all day,

3034
02:06:11.210 --> 02:06:12.320
but I didn't want to insult you.

3035
02:06:12.320 --> 02:06:13.153
LAURA: No, no, no, it's okay.

3036
02:06:13.153 --> 02:06:15.631
LIAM: You look a little bit like a snap pea.

3037
02:06:15.631 --> 02:06:17.840
LAURA: Oh, (laughs) yeah.
TALIESIN: Like a little sugar pea.

3038
02:06:17.840 --> 02:06:19.220
LAURA: They're really good.

3039
02:06:19.220 --> 02:06:20.410
Ooh!

3040
02:06:20.410 --> 02:06:22.390
I give Caduceus a hug.

3041
02:06:22.390 --> 02:06:24.523
TALIESIN: Got hugged by a sugar pea.

3042
02:06:24.523 --> 02:06:26.589
(laughter)

3043
02:06:26.589 --> 02:06:28.262
TRAVIS: Do we see any stables

3044
02:06:28.262 --> 02:06:31.783
or other areas where we might be able to board the...

3045
02:06:32.840 --> 02:06:35.350
MATT: I'll say you begin to peruse the exterior.

3046
02:06:35.350 --> 02:06:39.464
You do see a long row

3047
02:06:39.464 --> 02:06:43.440
of stable-like structures that are built into this

3048
02:06:43.440 --> 02:06:48.440
series of expansive buildings that are side-by-side.

3049
02:06:48.567 --> 02:06:50.117
They're made of stone and clay.

3050
02:06:52.070 --> 02:06:54.615
They're resembling a roughshod barracks,

3051
02:06:54.615 --> 02:06:57.290
that is the process of being continuous expanded.

3052
02:06:57.290 --> 02:06:59.930
There are, on both sides, expansions being constructed,

3053
02:06:59.930 --> 02:07:02.430
but for the time being the construction is halted.

3054
02:07:04.120 --> 02:07:05.160
There are soldiers all throughout,

3055
02:07:05.160 --> 02:07:08.172
and you can see there are sort

3056
02:07:08.172 --> 02:07:13.172
of the rough Xhorhas horses are set there,

3057
02:07:13.610 --> 02:07:16.880
a few military moorbounders that are armored are set there.

3058
02:07:16.880 --> 02:07:19.740
You do see some soldiers do have their own moorbounders

3059
02:07:19.740 --> 02:07:20.970
and are doing a perimeter

3060
02:07:20.970 --> 02:07:22.910
on the far outskirts in the city,

3061
02:07:22.910 --> 02:07:25.445
but it looks like it is directly under the Aurora Watch.

3062
02:07:25.445 --> 02:07:28.650
MARISHA: Any sign of any civilians?

3063
02:07:29.519 --> 02:07:31.440
MATT: As you get closer into the city

3064
02:07:31.440 --> 02:07:34.210
and you begin to take in the vicinity,

3065
02:07:34.210 --> 02:07:36.120
you do see some civilians

3066
02:07:36.120 --> 02:07:38.300
or at people that aren't fully armored

3067
02:07:38.300 --> 02:07:39.440
and armed like soldiers,

3068
02:07:39.440 --> 02:07:40.730
but everyone seems to carry,

3069
02:07:40.730 --> 02:07:44.395
even in regular clothing, some means of self-defense.

3070
02:07:45.618 --> 02:07:48.880
I'd say the ratio to immediately-recognizable

3071
02:07:48.880 --> 02:07:50.760
civilians to immediately-recognizable soldiers

3072
02:07:50.760 --> 02:07:52.877
is about one to four.

3073
02:07:52.877 --> 02:07:57.018
There's a primarily military presence in this city.

3074
02:07:57.018 --> 02:07:58.430
LIAM: So people are risking their asses

3075
02:07:58.430 --> 02:08:00.564
to make money out here in hell.

3076
02:08:00.564 --> 02:08:01.397
MARISHA: Yeah.

3077
02:08:01.397 --> 02:08:03.970
There are probably a few bars.

3078
02:08:03.970 --> 02:08:05.080
TRAVIS: We should find out what the nightly

3079
02:08:05.080 --> 02:08:08.601
threats are around here, what they're used to fighting off.

3080
02:08:08.601 --> 02:08:10.867
LIAM: Yeah, and why they look so haggard.

3081
02:08:12.509 --> 02:08:14.060
TRAVIS: All right, let's see if we can find

3082
02:08:14.060 --> 02:08:16.431
an empty stable for the kitties.

3083
02:08:16.431 --> 02:08:17.264
LIAM: Yeah.

3084
02:08:17.264 --> 02:08:18.200
That, and then we'll get a nightcap

3085
02:08:18.200 --> 02:08:19.310
and find out a little bit,

3086
02:08:19.310 --> 02:08:21.604
and then go the hell to bed.

3087
02:08:21.604 --> 02:08:24.865
MATT: With your emblems of the Bright Queen,

3088
02:08:24.865 --> 02:08:27.768
space is tight, but you can find a place

3089
02:08:27.768 --> 02:08:29.233
to keep them for the night.

3090
02:08:30.341 --> 02:08:32.664
You get the sense from the request

3091
02:08:32.664 --> 02:08:34.938
that they're not happy about it,

3092
02:08:34.938 --> 02:08:39.696
but they're willing to provide for a short duration.

3093
02:08:41.271 --> 02:08:45.629
Everyone seems to be very intent

3094
02:08:45.629 --> 02:08:49.914
in keeping what they have their own.

3095
02:08:49.914 --> 02:08:52.628
This isn't a very sharing society.

3096
02:08:55.129 --> 02:08:57.309
TRAVIS: All right, should we find somewhere to stay?

3097
02:08:57.309 --> 02:08:58.996
SAM: Yeah, let's go.

3098
02:08:59.830 --> 02:09:00.840
TRAVIS: Do we see anything that looks

3099
02:09:00.840 --> 02:09:02.890
like it might have extra space,

3100
02:09:02.890 --> 02:09:04.480
or voices coming from inside,

3101
02:09:04.480 --> 02:09:05.840
some sort of shared hall?

3102
02:09:05.840 --> 02:09:08.570
LIAM: Or is there anyone walking about right now?

3103
02:09:09.420 --> 02:09:10.921
MATT: There are a handful of folks.

3104
02:09:10.921 --> 02:09:12.315
I mean, there are soldiers all over,

3105
02:09:12.315 --> 02:09:14.330
and there are watches that are doing patrols

3106
02:09:14.330 --> 02:09:16.940
both through the city and towards the base of the mountain.

3107
02:09:16.940 --> 02:09:19.480
you can make out the basic shapes

3108
02:09:19.480 --> 02:09:20.540
from what little bit of moonlight's coming

3109
02:09:20.540 --> 02:09:21.650
through the broken clouds.

3110
02:09:21.650 --> 02:09:23.310
The wind does carry through on occasion.

3111
02:09:23.310 --> 02:09:24.320
There's a bit of dust that picks up

3112
02:09:24.320 --> 02:09:26.500
and wrecks visibility for a few minutes,

3113
02:09:26.500 --> 02:09:27.610
but then you look up and you can see

3114
02:09:27.610 --> 02:09:29.140
where the mountain range carries up

3115
02:09:29.140 --> 02:09:30.870
the shape of those towers that all begin

3116
02:09:30.870 --> 02:09:34.060
to build up and emerge from portions

3117
02:09:34.060 --> 02:09:35.560
of the mountainside above you.

3118
02:09:37.189 --> 02:09:40.860
You can see faint bits of green lantern light

3119
02:09:40.860 --> 02:09:41.960
towards the base of it,

3120
02:09:41.960 --> 02:09:46.140
similar to a lot of the light that gives the glow

3121
02:09:46.140 --> 02:09:47.890
to the central portions of Rosohna.

3122
02:09:48.750 --> 02:09:53.750
LIAM: Fjord, maybe you ask around for a place.

3123
02:09:53.937 --> 02:09:56.732
TRAVIS: Sure, yeah. Smart.

3124
02:09:56.732 --> 02:10:00.490
All right, can I find a small grouping

3125
02:10:00.490 --> 02:10:02.690
of maybe these soldiers?

3126
02:10:02.690 --> 02:10:03.530
MATT: Easy enough.

3127
02:10:03.530 --> 02:10:04.620
There's plenty of them to go around.

3128
02:10:04.620 --> 02:10:06.480
You come across a group of four of them.

3129
02:10:07.607 --> 02:10:11.820
The first one you see, full armor, full set,

3130
02:10:11.820 --> 02:10:16.820
helmet, approaches you, lighter,

3131
02:10:16.910 --> 02:10:19.024
reedier voice as you approach.

3132
02:10:19.024 --> 02:10:20.446
"Can I help you?"

3133
02:10:20.446 --> 02:10:22.840
TRAVIS: We're stopping through just for the night

3134
02:10:22.840 --> 02:10:25.490
before we continue on our business for the Bright Queen.

3135
02:10:25.490 --> 02:10:28.333
Looking for lodging, somewhere to stay.

3136
02:10:29.984 --> 02:10:31.950
MATT: "There is probably a room in the barracks.

3137
02:10:31.950 --> 02:10:33.340
"It's not very comfortable.

3138
02:10:33.340 --> 02:10:36.859
"Or you could try to go for The Ready Room,

3139
02:10:36.859 --> 02:10:38.880
"but it's as uncomfortable.

3140
02:10:38.880 --> 02:10:40.967
"We don't have many visitors that come through."

3141
02:10:40.967 --> 02:10:43.359
TRAVIS: Why's it called The Ready Room?

3142
02:10:43.359 --> 02:10:44.718
MATT: "That's where most of the supplies

3143
02:10:44.718 --> 02:10:47.662
"for general populace is kept."

3144
02:10:47.662 --> 02:10:50.970
TRAVIS: Any other stores that you could make us aware of,

3145
02:10:50.970 --> 02:10:52.450
or we might be able to restock

3146
02:10:52.450 --> 02:10:54.903
or upgrade our situation?

3147
02:10:54.903 --> 02:10:56.430
MATT: "The Ready Room would probably be the best bet.

3148
02:10:56.430 --> 02:11:00.719
"Everything else is currently in the military set."

3149
02:11:00.719 --> 02:11:01.670
TRAVIS: Appreciate that.

3150
02:11:01.670 --> 02:11:05.868
By the way, seems like you fellas have seen some shit.

3151
02:11:07.062 --> 02:11:09.985
What's on the watch list for tonight?

3152
02:11:11.428 --> 02:11:15.210
Threats, terrors, things you see often?

3153
02:11:15.210 --> 02:11:17.710
MATT: "Well, there is everything that lives south

3154
02:11:17.710 --> 02:11:19.490
"of this place in the Barbed Fields,

3155
02:11:19.490 --> 02:11:22.820
"and everything that attempts to escape from that,"

3156
02:11:22.820 --> 02:11:25.690
and points towards the northern mountain

3157
02:11:25.690 --> 02:11:30.000
where the large temple-like structure that you noticed is.

3158
02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.360
TRAVIS: Escapes from that?

3159
02:11:32.360 --> 02:11:33.193
MATT: "Yes."

3160
02:11:34.330 --> 02:11:36.800
TRAVIS: We've come through the Barbed Fields,

3161
02:11:36.800 --> 02:11:39.910
so we've certainly seen what's behind us,

3162
02:11:39.910 --> 02:11:43.340
including a giant bird-like creature.

3163
02:11:43.340 --> 02:11:44.984
I'm sure you're familiar.

3164
02:11:44.984 --> 02:11:46.060
MATT: "(chuckles) Yes.

3165
02:11:46.060 --> 02:11:49.097
"The rocs do occasionally hunt."

3166
02:11:49.097 --> 02:11:52.040
TRAVIS: What do you mean escape from up there?

3167
02:11:52.040 --> 02:11:54.222
What is that?

3168
02:11:54.222 --> 02:11:57.080
MATT: "This is the Umbra Gates,"

3169
02:11:57.080 --> 02:11:59.160
and they point off towards the base of it.

3170
02:11:59.160 --> 02:12:01.620
You can see where the green lantern lights are.

3171
02:12:01.620 --> 02:12:05.120
There's a large set of gargantuan black doors.

3172
02:12:05.120 --> 02:12:06.938
TRAVIS: Umber Gates?
MATT: Umbra Gates.

3173
02:12:06.938 --> 02:12:08.328
TRAVIS: Umbra.

3174
02:12:08.328 --> 02:12:13.328
MATT: "This entire mountainside was a

3175
02:12:13.636 --> 02:12:15.852
"prominent temple

3176
02:12:15.852 --> 02:12:19.410
"to a number of Betrayer Gods long ago.

3177
02:12:21.065 --> 02:12:23.901
"We began to reclaim elements of it,

3178
02:12:23.901 --> 02:12:26.100
"but then uncovered that there was,

3179
02:12:26.100 --> 02:12:29.748
"in the time since the Divergence,

3180
02:12:29.748 --> 02:12:33.590
"quite a number of remaining doorways.

3181
02:12:36.120 --> 02:12:39.032
"We only managed to build part

3182
02:12:39.032 --> 02:12:42.410
"of this city before it was assailed,

3183
02:12:42.410 --> 02:12:45.410
"and now we sit for the better part

3184
02:12:45.410 --> 02:12:47.582
"of a century at a stalemate."

3185
02:12:49.443 --> 02:12:52.840
TRAVIS: You mean, things come out of there,

3186
02:12:52.840 --> 02:12:55.020
you try and fight them off as best you can,

3187
02:12:55.020 --> 02:12:57.067
and no ground has been won?

3188
02:12:57.067 --> 02:13:00.982
MATT: "There has been some ground won, and then it was lost,

3189
02:13:00.982 --> 02:13:03.180
"and then some ground was lost, and then it was won.

3190
02:13:04.096 --> 02:13:07.290
"Unfortunately, we were doing much better

3191
02:13:07.290 --> 02:13:11.092
"until we had to divide some of our forces to the west

3192
02:13:11.092 --> 02:13:14.250
"to deal with the Empire."

3193
02:13:14.250 --> 02:13:16.680
He looks past you towards the cluster

3194
02:13:16.680 --> 02:13:21.398
of the rest of your group a little ways off to the side.

3195
02:13:23.440 --> 02:13:26.065
"We're doing the best we can with what we have."

3196
02:13:26.065 --> 02:13:27.515
LAURA: I'm doing the Cabbage Patch.

3197
02:13:27.515 --> 02:13:29.940
(laughter)

3198
02:13:29.940 --> 02:13:32.160
TALIESIN: That's a funky pea.

3199
02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:34.700
TRAVIS: I peek over my shoulder at the group

3200
02:13:34.700 --> 02:13:37.010
and see Jester doing the fucking Cabbage Patch,

3201
02:13:37.010 --> 02:13:40.460
and I'm like: They might not look like much,

3202
02:13:40.460 --> 02:13:42.301
but we're here to help.

3203
02:13:42.301 --> 02:13:44.300
SAM: Woo, woo!

3204
02:13:44.300 --> 02:13:47.726
TRAVIS: Most of us are here to help.

3205
02:13:47.726 --> 02:13:49.192
Some of us are here to help.

3206
02:13:49.192 --> 02:13:52.283
(laughter)

3207
02:13:52.283 --> 02:13:54.110
MATT: "Well, we'll take everything we can get."

3208
02:13:55.567 --> 02:13:56.940
TRAVIS: I'm Fjord.

3209
02:13:56.940 --> 02:13:58.280
We are the Mighty Nein.

3210
02:13:58.280 --> 02:14:01.560
If you need anything, just holler.

3211
02:14:01.560 --> 02:14:06.080
MATT: "I am Sulo, and (sighs)

3212
02:14:06.080 --> 02:14:07.996
"welcome to hell."

3213
02:14:07.996 --> 02:14:09.171
TRAVIS: Sulo.

3214
02:14:10.323 --> 02:14:12.000
SAM: Why would they build a city here?

3215
02:14:13.310 --> 02:14:14.920
TRAVIS: The Umbra Gates.

3216
02:14:14.920 --> 02:14:19.060
I go back and relay all of that to the group.

3217
02:14:19.060 --> 02:14:20.450
Have any of y'all heard

3218
02:14:20.450 --> 02:14:22.440
of something called the Umbra Gates?

3219
02:14:22.440 --> 02:14:23.565
TALIESIN: Have we ever heard of something

3220
02:14:23.565 --> 02:14:24.773
called The Umbra Gates?

3221
02:14:24.773 --> 02:14:26.530
MATT: You can make a history check, sure.

3222
02:14:26.530 --> 02:14:29.120
TALIESIN: All right, history check.

3223
02:14:29.120 --> 02:14:30.860
Not a religion check.
MATT: Nope!

3224
02:14:30.860 --> 02:14:33.512
LAURA: Natural 20!

3225
02:14:33.512 --> 02:14:34.815
TALIESIN: 18.
TRAVIS: 18.

3226
02:14:34.815 --> 02:14:37.828
LIAM: 23 and a natural 20.

3227
02:14:37.828 --> 02:14:38.970
MATT: Very nice.

3228
02:14:39.980 --> 02:14:44.230
Okay yeah, so Bazzoxan wasn't the name of a village.

3229
02:14:44.230 --> 02:14:47.584
The Bazzoxan was the name of this temple,

3230
02:14:47.584 --> 02:14:52.584
and it was, to your recollection,

3231
02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:54.310
in some of the books that you read.

3232
02:14:54.310 --> 02:14:56.137
You spent a lot of time alone,

3233
02:14:56.137 --> 02:14:58.580
and brag a little bit recalling this information

3234
02:14:58.580 --> 02:15:02.790
because Caleb did not.

3235
02:15:04.223 --> 02:15:07.798
This in particular was a deep-set

3236
02:15:07.798 --> 02:15:12.445
multi, multi, multi-leveled temple

3237
02:15:12.445 --> 02:15:16.530
that was the center of the Prime Material Plane's seat

3238
02:15:16.530 --> 02:15:19.580
to the Princes of the Abyss.

3239
02:15:19.580 --> 02:15:21.790
ALL: Ooh!
TRAVIS: Ooh, fuck!

3240
02:15:21.790 --> 02:15:26.650
MATT: The Demonic Princes all had some...

3241
02:15:26.650 --> 02:15:28.240
In a brief period of time in which

3242
02:15:28.240 --> 02:15:30.720
there was unity between them for the purposes

3243
02:15:30.720 --> 02:15:35.698
of the agreement of these entities in the Calamity,

3244
02:15:35.698 --> 02:15:38.348
they all held different seats throughout this temple.

3245
02:15:39.918 --> 02:15:43.568
This was where the Seat of the Abyss sat in Xhorhas.

3246
02:15:44.550 --> 02:15:46.350
LAURA: Oh, Jesus.
TALIESIN: Anti-Rock of Eternity,

3247
02:15:46.350 --> 02:15:49.104
for all the Shazam nerds.

3248
02:15:49.104 --> 02:15:51.395
LIAM: Is this the location on ever Final Fantasy game

3249
02:15:51.395 --> 02:15:53.570
where you got to max out all your stats?

3250
02:15:54.450 --> 02:15:56.580
MATT: Oh, here? No.
LIAM: No? (laughs)

3251
02:15:56.580 --> 02:15:58.110
MATT: Well, could be.
LIAM: Maybe?

3252
02:15:58.110 --> 02:15:59.850
MATT: Could be, depending on how long you want to hang.

3253
02:15:59.850 --> 02:16:02.020
LIAM: Na, na, na, na, na, na, na.

3254
02:16:02.020 --> 02:16:03.230
MATT: But you only have the history of the location.

3255
02:16:03.230 --> 02:16:04.750
You don't have the history of any of the local politics.

3256
02:16:04.750 --> 02:16:06.969
You've had no experience of the Xhorhas

3257
02:16:06.969 --> 02:16:10.090
or the culture of the Dynasty before all this.

3258
02:16:10.090 --> 02:16:12.530
TRAVIS: Abyss is demons, Hell is devils.

3259
02:16:12.530 --> 02:16:13.580
MATT: Correct.

3260
02:16:15.210 --> 02:16:19.579
SAM: Fjord, this Ready Room, does that sound like a hotel?

3261
02:16:19.579 --> 02:16:23.306
LAURA: I had a children's book of all the levels of--

3262
02:16:23.306 --> 02:16:26.648
MATT: (child-like) Yeenoghu and Orcus!

3263
02:16:26.648 --> 02:16:29.193
TRAVIS: It sounds like a co-op really more than anything,

3264
02:16:29.193 --> 02:16:30.621
but yeah.
SAM: Co-op?

3265
02:16:30.621 --> 02:16:33.270
TRAVIS: Yeah, you know, drop a little,

3266
02:16:33.270 --> 02:16:36.350
pick up a little, stay if you need to.

3267
02:16:36.350 --> 02:16:38.900
SAM: Is that our best bet, then?
TRAVIS: Sounds like it.

3268
02:16:38.900 --> 02:16:41.271
Unless you just want to rough it in the barracks.

3269
02:16:41.271 --> 02:16:42.156
SAM: Ew.

3270
02:16:43.173 --> 02:16:45.890
LIAM: I think we should stay apart from the soldiers here.

3271
02:16:45.890 --> 02:16:47.163
TALIESIN: I would agree.

3272
02:16:47.163 --> 02:16:50.160
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's see what we can find.

3273
02:16:50.160 --> 02:16:52.876
We'll head over to the Ready Room.

3274
02:16:52.876 --> 02:16:54.466
LIAM: Good name.
MATT: Okay.

3275
02:16:54.466 --> 02:16:56.120
You make your way there and you gather,

3276
02:16:56.120 --> 02:16:58.080
based on the conversation the military presence here,

3277
02:16:58.080 --> 02:17:02.445
this is probably very much like a martial law locale.

3278
02:17:04.183 --> 02:17:06.310
Eventually, asking a few questions,

3279
02:17:06.310 --> 02:17:07.510
you find your way towards

3280
02:17:07.510 --> 02:17:10.120
a massive barn, like a pointed-top barn.

3281
02:17:10.120 --> 02:17:13.009
It's a gradual curve to both of its sides.

3282
02:17:13.009 --> 02:17:17.200
Atop there is a sign that has multiple languages

3283
02:17:17.200 --> 02:17:19.524
written in it, but one of them is Ready Room in Common.

3284
02:17:19.524 --> 02:17:21.500
You can see there are soldiers out front

3285
02:17:21.500 --> 02:17:24.180
that are in the process of gathering large spindles

3286
02:17:24.180 --> 02:17:27.380
of rope and putting them onto the back of their horses.

3287
02:17:27.380 --> 02:17:29.510
Some people are gathering wood and construction supplies.

3288
02:17:29.510 --> 02:17:30.770
Some folks are bringing things back,

3289
02:17:30.770 --> 02:17:32.970
tools they don't need anymore to sell back.

3290
02:17:32.970 --> 02:17:35.577
This is one of the central barter,

3291
02:17:35.577 --> 02:17:38.200
trade places of Bazzoxan.

3292
02:17:38.200 --> 02:17:40.320
SAM: Is it all drow everywhere?

3293
02:17:40.320 --> 02:17:43.947
MATT: I'd say it's about 80% drow, approximately.

3294
02:17:43.947 --> 02:17:46.840
Yeah, it is 80% drow.

3295
02:17:46.840 --> 02:17:48.440
Wow, look at that memory.

3296
02:17:48.440 --> 02:17:50.040
You do some other goblinoid races.

3297
02:17:50.040 --> 02:17:52.925
There's the occasional ogre, some goblins,

3298
02:17:52.925 --> 02:17:55.140
occasionally a hobgoblin or a bugbear,

3299
02:17:55.140 --> 02:17:57.740
but it's primary drow up here in Bazzoxan.

3300
02:17:57.740 --> 02:17:59.620
You get the sense from here in Rosohna,

3301
02:17:59.620 --> 02:18:03.230
most of the monstrous races

3302
02:18:03.230 --> 02:18:06.788
and the waste folk

3303
02:18:06.788 --> 02:18:09.071
are to the west near Asarius,

3304
02:18:09.071 --> 02:18:11.420
in the open fields of Xhorhas there.

3305
02:18:11.420 --> 02:18:12.300
The closer you get to Rosohna,

3306
02:18:12.300 --> 02:18:16.992
the more that the drow are primarily the presence there.

3307
02:18:18.320 --> 02:18:19.839
As you approach the outside,

3308
02:18:19.839 --> 02:18:21.860
you get a couple strange looks as you pass

3309
02:18:21.860 --> 02:18:23.660
but nobody bothers you as you've casually

3310
02:18:23.660 --> 02:18:26.200
made your way this far into of the city.

3311
02:18:26.200 --> 02:18:29.310
You enter the front room and you can see the interior

3312
02:18:29.310 --> 02:18:32.340
of this large barn, which tip-to-the-floor

3313
02:18:32.340 --> 02:18:35.619
probably stands about 45 feet tall

3314
02:18:35.619 --> 02:18:39.195
and about 65 to 70 feet end-to-end.

3315
02:18:39.195 --> 02:18:41.780
A lot of this is just an open space

3316
02:18:41.780 --> 02:18:43.400
where there's just stacks and stacks

3317
02:18:43.400 --> 02:18:44.670
of materials and equipment.

3318
02:18:44.670 --> 02:18:47.640
You can see lanterns, shovels, pickaxes.

3319
02:18:47.640 --> 02:18:50.280
You can see basic furniture, ladders,

3320
02:18:50.280 --> 02:18:53.706
everything you would need for a very basic lifestyle

3321
02:18:53.706 --> 02:18:58.181
in construction, maintenance, and

3322
02:18:58.181 --> 02:18:59.314
building of all kinds.

3323
02:18:59.314 --> 02:19:02.110
There's masonry tools and all sorts

3324
02:19:02.110 --> 02:19:04.717
of very, very simple adhesives available.

3325
02:19:04.717 --> 02:19:06.130
Then you can see there's a ladder

3326
02:19:06.130 --> 02:19:10.175
that leads up into an upper top deck area,

3327
02:19:10.175 --> 02:19:13.970
and there is a sign that says "Lodging."

3328
02:19:15.640 --> 02:19:18.215
It looks pretty rough and tumble.

3329
02:19:19.360 --> 02:19:22.400
TALIESIN: There's nowhere that looks like it would have

3330
02:19:22.400 --> 02:19:25.017
some spell components or anything like that?

3331
02:19:25.017 --> 02:19:27.894
MATT: Depends on what spell components you're asking about.

3332
02:19:27.894 --> 02:19:30.167
But you do see on the front,

3333
02:19:30.167 --> 02:19:32.030
most of the folks that were doing business have left

3334
02:19:32.030 --> 02:19:34.020
and you see they're gathering and returning things.

3335
02:19:34.020 --> 02:19:36.040
The interior, for the most part, is empty at this hour,

3336
02:19:36.040 --> 02:19:39.082
expect for you can see a pair of younger drow

3337
02:19:39.082 --> 02:19:42.908
that are sitting across the far counter on the opposite end.

3338
02:19:42.908 --> 02:19:47.908
The young female drow you can see has a short,

3339
02:19:48.549 --> 02:19:51.950
almost bob cut to her hair, is in the process

3340
02:19:51.950 --> 02:19:54.717
of gathering and marking down materials.

3341
02:19:54.717 --> 02:19:57.340
The male drow looks similar in age,

3342
02:19:57.340 --> 02:20:01.029
is in the process of moving boxes up

3343
02:20:01.029 --> 02:20:03.130
onto the counter then notices you guys arrive

3344
02:20:03.130 --> 02:20:04.930
and gives a (clears throat).

3345
02:20:04.930 --> 02:20:07.460
Gives a nudge over to his partner.

3346
02:20:09.700 --> 02:20:11.000
"How may we help you?"

3347
02:20:12.070 --> 02:20:14.450
TRAVIS: We're looking for shelter for the night.

3348
02:20:16.579 --> 02:20:19.390
MATT: "Well, we can certainly provide it.

3349
02:20:19.390 --> 02:20:20.950
"It is how many?

3350
02:20:20.950 --> 02:20:22.150
"All of you?"
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3351
02:20:22.150 --> 02:20:25.390
SAM: That's right, plus for our livestock.

3352
02:20:25.390 --> 02:20:27.620
TRAVIS: No, we let someone else take care of that.

3353
02:20:27.620 --> 02:20:29.703
SAM: We did? Oh, sorry.

3354
02:20:29.703 --> 02:20:31.490
MATT: "For all of you for the night,

3355
02:20:31.490 --> 02:20:34.490
"that would be one gold, two silver."

3356
02:20:35.332 --> 02:20:37.287
TRAVIS: I got it.
LAURA: Thanks, Fjord.

3357
02:20:37.287 --> 02:20:38.760
TRAVIS: No problem.

3358
02:20:38.760 --> 02:20:41.190
LAURA: Is there anybody outside of the building

3359
02:20:41.190 --> 02:20:43.903
that is watching the outside?

3360
02:20:43.903 --> 02:20:45.500
MATT: There are people outside the building currently, yeah,

3361
02:20:45.500 --> 02:20:48.170
that are in the process of offloading equipment

3362
02:20:48.170 --> 02:20:50.910
or picking up equipment.
LAURA: Okay.

3363
02:20:50.910 --> 02:20:52.650
MATT: They're not focused on you,

3364
02:20:52.650 --> 02:20:54.610
but you can hear them shifting things,

3365
02:20:54.610 --> 02:20:57.616
the impact of heavy sacks and building materials

3366
02:20:57.616 --> 02:20:59.830
(crashing) scraping on the ground.

3367
02:20:59.830 --> 02:21:01.796
LAURA: I'm going to stand next to the sign

3368
02:21:01.796 --> 02:21:04.379
to the Ready Room.

3369
02:21:04.379 --> 02:21:06.760
TRAVIS: We spoke to Sulo outside.

3370
02:21:06.760 --> 02:21:09.620
He said to inquire about the sort

3371
02:21:09.620 --> 02:21:12.703
of encounters you have around here.

3372
02:21:13.695 --> 02:21:15.507
MATT: "Oh (chuckles).

3373
02:21:15.507 --> 02:21:18.270
"Thankfully not too many for the ones

3374
02:21:18.270 --> 02:21:22.055
"that are watching the gates, but

3375
02:21:23.380 --> 02:21:25.513
fiendish creatures sometimes wander

3376
02:21:25.513 --> 02:21:29.850
"past the gates or the tower.

3377
02:21:29.850 --> 02:21:32.126
"Soldiers tend to them as best they can."

3378
02:21:32.126 --> 02:21:33.910
TRAVIS: From what you've heard, how long does it take

3379
02:21:33.910 --> 02:21:36.550
to get from here to those towers?

3380
02:21:36.550 --> 02:21:37.383
MATT: "I have not been up there.

3381
02:21:37.383 --> 02:21:38.216
"I do not know."

3382
02:21:38.216 --> 02:21:40.370
TRAVIS: I'm sure you've heard them talking about it, though.

3383
02:21:40.370 --> 02:21:43.280
MATT: "I don't want to bother myself with this sort of--"

3384
02:21:43.280 --> 02:21:44.480
TRAVIS: You don't hear things?

3385
02:21:46.500 --> 02:21:48.270
MATT: He gives you a stale look.

3386
02:21:49.460 --> 02:21:51.560
TRAVIS: I take out the symbol of the Bright Queen.

3387
02:21:51.560 --> 02:21:52.490
Don't mean anything by it.

3388
02:21:52.490 --> 02:21:54.600
We're just here to do a thorough job.

3389
02:21:54.600 --> 02:21:55.700
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

3390
02:21:55.700 --> 02:21:58.720
LAURA: I cast Bless on me and Fjord and...

3391
02:21:59.570 --> 02:22:01.340
TRAVIS: Does that do anything for this roll?

3392
02:22:01.340 --> 02:22:02.324
LAURA: Beau.

3393
02:22:02.324 --> 02:22:06.170
TALIESIN: No, it's just a check.

3394
02:22:06.170 --> 02:22:08.490
TRAVIS: 16.
MATT: 16.

3395
02:22:08.490 --> 02:22:13.490
Okay, he goes, "(sighs) There are multiple barricades

3396
02:22:13.603 --> 02:22:15.580
"set up throughout the exterior

3397
02:22:15.580 --> 02:22:18.510
"and interior of the various tunnels of Bazzoxan,

3398
02:22:19.658 --> 02:22:22.480
"but things still manage to creep past

3399
02:22:22.480 --> 02:22:27.360
"and the soldiers kill them and try to fill the gaps."

3400
02:22:29.722 --> 02:22:31.925
TRAVIS: Are there access to these tunnels?

3401
02:22:32.950 --> 02:22:35.170
MATT: "For the Aurora Watch, yes."

3402
02:22:37.643 --> 02:22:40.875
TRAVIS: Any food? Do we need any food?

3403
02:22:40.875 --> 02:22:42.300
TALIESIN: It would certainly help for tomorrow

3404
02:22:42.300 --> 02:22:43.310
if we had access to some food.

3405
02:22:43.310 --> 02:22:44.960
TRAVIS: We do have some moorbounders outside,

3406
02:22:44.960 --> 02:22:47.570
and we need some rough rations for them.

3407
02:22:47.570 --> 02:22:48.403
MATT: "That can be provided.

3408
02:22:48.403 --> 02:22:49.236
"Prima!"

3409
02:22:49.236 --> 02:22:51.690
The girl has been listening

3410
02:22:51.690 --> 02:22:53.900
but trying to look like she's not paying attention.

3411
02:22:53.900 --> 02:22:55.230
"Yes, brother?"

3412
02:22:55.230 --> 02:22:58.390
"We have some more guests for the night,

3413
02:22:58.390 --> 02:23:00.600
"if you could prepare us some food for them,

3414
02:23:00.600 --> 02:23:02.740
"and how many moorbounders you said?"

3415
02:23:02.740 --> 02:23:04.115
TRAVIS: We have three.

3416
02:23:04.115 --> 02:23:05.740
MATT: "Three moorbounders."

3417
02:23:05.740 --> 02:23:07.230
She goes, "All right, very well.

3418
02:23:07.230 --> 02:23:08.080
"I'll make food for them,

3419
02:23:08.080 --> 02:23:09.650
"you get the food for the moorbounders."

3420
02:23:11.300 --> 02:23:12.133
"All right."

3421
02:23:13.200 --> 02:23:14.390
TRAVIS: I appreciate your help.

3422
02:23:14.390 --> 02:23:16.120
I know it may not go too far out here,

3423
02:23:16.120 --> 02:23:18.996
but here's another two gold for each of you.

3424
02:23:18.996 --> 02:23:19.829
MATT: "Thank you,

3425
02:23:19.829 --> 02:23:21.867
"it will cover most of the moorbounder food.

3426
02:23:21.867 --> 02:23:24.010
"An additional gold for the remainder

3427
02:23:24.010 --> 02:23:25.310
"of the moorbounder meals, please."

3428
02:23:25.310 --> 02:23:28.500
TRAVIS: Not a problem.
MATT: "They are hungry beasts."

3429
02:23:28.500 --> 02:23:30.600
LIAM: Excuse me.

3430
02:23:30.600 --> 02:23:33.330
I know this might be a bit of a long shot

3431
02:23:33.330 --> 02:23:34.870
for your establishment,

3432
02:23:34.870 --> 02:23:37.750
but have you any incense here?

3433
02:23:39.280 --> 02:23:40.880
MATT: "Prima, do we have an incense?"

3434
02:23:40.880 --> 02:23:42.860
TALIESIN: And ivory also, if there's any rolling around.

3435
02:23:42.860 --> 02:23:45.402
I got some stuff I got to do, too.

3436
02:23:45.402 --> 02:23:46.235
MATT: "Or ivory.

3437
02:23:47.780 --> 02:23:48.830
"How much do you need?

3438
02:23:50.760 --> 02:23:52.330
"Like a pinch?"

3439
02:23:52.330 --> 02:23:55.680
LIAM: I would take as much incense as you have.

3440
02:23:55.680 --> 02:23:56.830
I will take it off your hands.

3441
02:23:56.830 --> 02:23:58.580
TALIESIN: I need 250 gold worth of incense

3442
02:23:58.580 --> 02:24:00.465
and 200 gold worth of ivory.

3443
02:24:00.465 --> 02:24:02.210
LIAM: You also need incense?
TALIESIN: Incense and ivory.

3444
02:24:02.210 --> 02:24:04.650
I got a thing.
MARISHA: That is so much.

3445
02:24:04.650 --> 02:24:05.889
LIAM: How much do you have?

3446
02:24:05.889 --> 02:24:08.598
MATT: You see his eyes get wide.

3447
02:24:08.598 --> 02:24:09.498
"Prima?" (laughs)

3448
02:24:09.498 --> 02:24:11.514
LIAM: We will pay a premium.

3449
02:24:11.514 --> 02:24:15.320
MATT: She goes, "Premium, you say?"

3450
02:24:15.320 --> 02:24:19.987
LIAM: Yes, 10% more than you are accustomed to charging.

3451
02:24:21.450 --> 02:24:22.283
MATT: "Give me an hour.

3452
02:24:22.283 --> 02:24:25.515
"I need to go call in some favors."

3453
02:24:25.515 --> 02:24:27.690
LIAM: I can give you that hour.

3454
02:24:27.690 --> 02:24:30.398
SAM: Do you have a barrel of peanut butter

3455
02:24:30.398 --> 02:24:32.960
and 400 meters of wire,

3456
02:24:32.960 --> 02:24:35.415
and a pound of dove feathers?

3457
02:24:36.630 --> 02:24:39.210
MATT: "I can inquire."
SAM: Cool.

3458
02:24:40.339 --> 02:24:41.842
TRAVIS: Did you want any of those things, Nott?

3459
02:24:41.842 --> 02:24:42.675
SAM: Not really.

3460
02:24:42.675 --> 02:24:45.840
I want to know what their inventory is.

3461
02:24:45.840 --> 02:24:48.015
It seems extensive.

3462
02:24:48.015 --> 02:24:49.498
TRAVIS: Apologies.

3463
02:24:50.467 --> 02:24:51.300
MATT: "It's all right.

3464
02:24:51.300 --> 02:24:53.700
"We don't have a lot of trade that comes through,

3465
02:24:53.700 --> 02:24:58.630
"but we have had merchants who came, didn't leave,

3466
02:24:58.630 --> 02:25:03.540
"so the remaining materials were brought to us.

3467
02:25:04.930 --> 02:25:05.840
"Let me go check."

3468
02:25:05.840 --> 02:25:07.070
She comes from around the counter

3469
02:25:07.070 --> 02:25:10.880
and passes all of you and exits the complex.

3470
02:25:10.880 --> 02:25:12.250
LAURA: While they were all inside talking,

3471
02:25:12.250 --> 02:25:15.417
I was trying to paint the sign.

3472
02:25:15.417 --> 02:25:16.250
MATT: Okay.

3473
02:25:16.250 --> 02:25:20.120
LAURA: Ready Room to Ruddy Poon.

3474
02:25:20.120 --> 02:25:22.980
It's an easy exchange.
SAM: Three letters?

3475
02:25:22.980 --> 02:25:23.920
LAURA: Three little lines.

3476
02:25:23.920 --> 02:25:25.610
It's three little lines.
MATT: There is a ladder

3477
02:25:25.610 --> 02:25:27.630
on the inside that you can do, because it is high up.

3478
02:25:27.630 --> 02:25:29.929
It's about ten feet up for the barn door.

3479
02:25:29.929 --> 02:25:32.268
There are the folks out there that are doing business.

3480
02:25:32.268 --> 02:25:34.877
Are you still in your leaf costume?

3481
02:25:34.877 --> 02:25:37.050
(laughs)
LIAM: That's long gone.

3482
02:25:37.050 --> 02:25:38.150
LAURA: Yeah, that would have been gone by now.

3483
02:25:38.150 --> 02:25:39.986
MATT: Okay, I'm just asking.
TALIESIN: Damn.

3484
02:25:39.986 --> 02:25:41.583
(laughs)

3485
02:25:42.508 --> 02:25:45.455
MATT: Make a stealth check for me.
LAURA: Okay.

3486
02:25:47.742 --> 02:25:51.140
Ooh, 11.
MATT: 11, okay.

3487
02:25:51.140 --> 02:25:52.220
You go and as they're talking,

3488
02:25:52.220 --> 02:25:54.062
you grab the ladder off to the side.

3489
02:25:54.062 --> 02:25:56.102
(items clattering)

3490
02:25:56.102 --> 02:25:58.152
They all stop working, look at you.

3491
02:26:00.033 --> 02:26:04.300
You set the ladder by the side and you wait and wait,

3492
02:26:04.300 --> 02:26:05.620
and they go back to their business.

3493
02:26:05.620 --> 02:26:08.095
Make a sleight of hand check with disadvantage.

3494
02:26:08.095 --> 02:26:10.595
SAM: You can do this. You're blessed, right?

3495
02:26:10.595 --> 02:26:11.830
Did you use Bless on the last roll?

3496
02:26:11.830 --> 02:26:13.793
MATT: Bless doesn't help.
LAURA: It doesn't help with checks.

3497
02:26:13.793 --> 02:26:14.790
LIAM: You need Guidance.

3498
02:26:14.790 --> 02:26:19.040
LAURA: Oh, wait! Wait, okay.

3499
02:26:19.040 --> 02:26:20.250
With disadvantage?

3500
02:26:20.250 --> 02:26:21.610
Sleight of hand with disadvantage.

3501
02:26:21.610 --> 02:26:23.909
18.
SAM: Not bad!

3502
02:26:28.911 --> 02:26:31.094
MATT: It takes you the better part of about

3503
02:26:31.094 --> 02:26:32.194
ten minutes or so,

3504
02:26:32.194 --> 02:26:33.950
doing it one section of a letter at a time,

3505
02:26:33.950 --> 02:26:35.330
climbing up on the ladder

3506
02:26:35.330 --> 02:26:37.020
and just waiting and looking out,

3507
02:26:37.020 --> 02:26:41.353
and a little firefly comes by and you're like, "Oh!"

3508
02:26:43.410 --> 02:26:44.961
Get down, move the ladder.

3509
02:26:44.961 --> 02:26:47.142
Eventually, you manage to pull it off,

3510
02:26:47.142 --> 02:26:48.760
and most everyone seems to be leaving

3511
02:26:48.760 --> 02:26:51.260
with their materials and you finish up real fast,

3512
02:26:51.260 --> 02:26:52.720
and that is such, the Ruddy Poon

3513
02:26:52.720 --> 02:26:55.230
is now a center of goods

3514
02:26:55.230 --> 02:26:57.073
and commerce here on this side of Bazzoxan.

3515
02:26:57.073 --> 02:27:00.410
LAURA: Yay! Thank you, thank you.

3516
02:27:00.410 --> 02:27:03.045
MATT: You hear the distance chuckle of a disembodied voice.

3517
02:27:03.045 --> 02:27:05.128
"(laughs)"

3518
02:27:06.100 --> 02:27:08.180
TRAVIS: I'll ask once we've acquired our stuff.

3519
02:27:08.180 --> 02:27:10.240
I know we're still waiting.

3520
02:27:10.240 --> 02:27:14.030
We were also waiting to meet one of our fellows,

3521
02:27:14.030 --> 02:27:18.330
someone who's meeting us here by the name of Obann.

3522
02:27:18.330 --> 02:27:21.067
Has he come in yet?

3523
02:27:21.067 --> 02:27:23.740
MATT: "Describe Obann for me, please."

3524
02:27:23.740 --> 02:27:26.174
TALIESIN: Insight check.
MATT: Make an insight check.

3525
02:27:26.174 --> 02:27:31.050
SAM: Oh, boy.

3526
02:27:31.050 --> 02:27:33.350
TALIESIN: That's 26.
MATT: 26!

3527
02:27:33.350 --> 02:27:34.307
SAM: Whisper!

3528
02:27:35.551 --> 02:27:37.392
LAURA: ♪ Whispers ♪

3529
02:27:37.392 --> 02:27:42.180
SAM: Don't forget, the D&amp;D Beyond Encounter Builder Alpha

3530
02:27:42.180 --> 02:27:45.740
is now available to all D&amp;D Beyond subscribers.

3531
02:27:45.740 --> 02:27:47.050
I looked at it earlier.

3532
02:27:47.050 --> 02:27:49.290
It's pretty tight.

3533
02:27:49.290 --> 02:27:50.500
TALIESIN: Okay, okay.

3534
02:27:50.500 --> 02:27:51.790
LAURA and SAM: T-T-Tight.

3535
02:27:51.790 --> 02:27:55.110
Also Dwarven Forge exists. (laughs)

3536
02:27:58.963 --> 02:28:00.840
MATT: "Could you please describe?"

3537
02:28:00.840 --> 02:28:04.710
TRAVIS: Yeah, well, drow gentleman, ruggedly handsome,

3538
02:28:04.710 --> 02:28:05.760
you know, can handle himself.

3539
02:28:05.760 --> 02:28:08.010
I don't know, lazy.
SAM: Just a drow.

3540
02:28:08.010 --> 02:28:09.885
MATT: "You literally described

3541
02:28:09.885 --> 02:28:11.343
"most of the people who live here.

3542
02:28:11.343 --> 02:28:15.270
"But I don't believe I know of an Obann.

3543
02:28:17.690 --> 02:28:21.400
"My apologies."
TRAVIS: That's all right.

3544
02:28:21.400 --> 02:28:23.612
SAM: I saw Obnan, right?

3545
02:28:23.612 --> 02:28:24.617
MATT: Yeah.

3546
02:28:24.617 --> 02:28:29.617
SAM: I'll cast Silent Image to make an image of him.

3547
02:28:30.620 --> 02:28:33.460
MATT: He leans forward and inspects closely.

3548
02:28:33.460 --> 02:28:35.371
SAM: Obann's just like...

3549
02:28:35.371 --> 02:28:38.044
LIAM: Like R2 and Princess Leia.
LAURA: Yeah.

3550
02:28:38.044 --> 02:28:40.627
TALIESIN: Help me, Obann-Wan.
TRAVIS: Oh, stop.

3551
02:28:40.627 --> 02:28:43.120
(laughter)

3552
02:28:43.120 --> 02:28:45.820
MATT: "I feel like I may have seen this individual once,

3553
02:28:45.820 --> 02:28:47.530
"but that was months ago.

3554
02:28:47.530 --> 02:28:48.580
"No time recently."

3555
02:28:49.900 --> 02:28:51.280
TRAVIS: He is a slow traveler.

3556
02:28:51.280 --> 02:28:52.120
That's all right.

3557
02:28:52.120 --> 02:28:53.170
If he comes in in the night

3558
02:28:53.170 --> 02:28:55.617
tell him we're waiting for him.

3559
02:28:55.617 --> 02:28:58.025
MATT: "All right. It can be done."

3560
02:28:58.025 --> 02:29:00.220
You wait the better part of an hour,

3561
02:29:00.220 --> 02:29:04.360
and then Prima returns with a small box.

3562
02:29:05.410 --> 02:29:06.690
I say a small box.

3563
02:29:06.690 --> 02:29:09.822
It's a one-foot by about a foot and a half.

3564
02:29:09.822 --> 02:29:12.404
Lifts it up and puts it on the counter.

3565
02:29:12.404 --> 02:29:17.404
"So you needed how much incense? (chuckles)"

3566
02:29:19.140 --> 02:29:20.890
LIAM: We're talking about two different things,

3567
02:29:20.890 --> 02:29:22.840
but I think yours takes precedence.

3568
02:29:22.840 --> 02:29:24.860
TALIESIN: I need 250 gold worth of incense,

3569
02:29:24.860 --> 02:29:28.210
and 200 gold worth of ivory strips.

3570
02:29:28.210 --> 02:29:29.920
MATT: She reaches into a back pocket

3571
02:29:29.920 --> 02:29:31.550
and is rummaging around this large pack

3572
02:29:31.550 --> 02:29:33.400
that has a lock on the outside,

3573
02:29:33.400 --> 02:29:34.737
unlocks it, pulls it aside,

3574
02:29:34.737 --> 02:29:36.777
and lays onto the counter a bunch

3575
02:29:36.777 --> 02:29:40.849
of sections of tusk that resembles

3576
02:29:40.849 --> 02:29:43.660
polished elements of the udaak tusks,

3577
02:29:43.660 --> 02:29:47.329
the large tusks that emerge from the front of the face.

3578
02:29:47.329 --> 02:29:49.460
But they're shaved chunks.

3579
02:29:51.369 --> 02:29:53.080
A lot of times, the large tusks

3580
02:29:53.080 --> 02:29:54.760
either break down or the interior

3581
02:29:54.760 --> 02:29:58.189
has to be carved down to get to the solid ivory.

3582
02:29:58.189 --> 02:30:00.360
Lays out a number of chunks and goes,

3583
02:30:00.360 --> 02:30:01.890
"All right, that can be done.

3584
02:30:02.755 --> 02:30:03.874
"Incense."

3585
02:30:03.874 --> 02:30:05.670
She pulls open the crate

3586
02:30:05.670 --> 02:30:07.540
and immediately the smell wafts out,

3587
02:30:07.540 --> 02:30:11.060
this extremely strong, pungent collection

3588
02:30:11.060 --> 02:30:14.397
of spices and burnable materials.

3589
02:30:14.397 --> 02:30:18.816
It's like a dense Sephora blast to the face.

3590
02:30:20.280 --> 02:30:22.750
"We can deal with this as well, I believe."

3591
02:30:22.750 --> 02:30:24.620
LIAM: What is the rate for this?

3592
02:30:24.620 --> 02:30:26.300
MATT: "What, for the entire crate?"
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

3593
02:30:26.300 --> 02:30:28.390
MATT: "Oh, this will run you about a thousand gold pieces,

3594
02:30:28.390 --> 02:30:32.310
"but I can provide an amount of which

3595
02:30:32.310 --> 02:30:33.850
"seems to fulfill your requests."

3596
02:30:33.850 --> 02:30:36.950
TALIESIN: My personal need is about 250 gold worth,

3597
02:30:36.950 --> 02:30:38.145
plus the 200 gold worth--

3598
02:30:38.145 --> 02:30:40.370
MATT: "Only request is if anybody asks you,

3599
02:30:40.370 --> 02:30:42.350
"do not say where or how you received this."

3600
02:30:42.350 --> 02:30:44.885
TALIESIN: I probably won't even remember, honestly.

3601
02:30:44.885 --> 02:30:46.400
MATT: "Perfect, no worries."

3602
02:30:46.400 --> 02:30:48.958
LIAM: You need 250?

3603
02:30:48.958 --> 02:30:50.068
TALIESIN: 250 will do me.

3604
02:30:50.068 --> 02:30:53.514
LIAM: I would take what you would rate

3605
02:30:53.514 --> 02:30:57.043
at about 50 gold, and we will add 30 to the price of that.

3606
02:30:57.043 --> 02:30:59.040
MATT: "We will add 50 to the price,

3607
02:30:59.040 --> 02:31:03.133
"and it will be, say, 350 total?"

3608
02:31:04.983 --> 02:31:06.020
LIAM: (sighs)

3609
02:31:06.020 --> 02:31:08.935
SAM: Have we gathered or collected anything,

3610
02:31:08.935 --> 02:31:11.980
sundries or staples along our journey

3611
02:31:11.980 --> 02:31:14.310
that we could maybe use in trade

3612
02:31:14.310 --> 02:31:15.270
for some of this stuff?

3613
02:31:15.270 --> 02:31:17.010
Have we picked up any weird,

3614
02:31:18.990 --> 02:31:22.010
20 pounds of, I don't know, something.

3615
02:31:22.010 --> 02:31:24.980
LIAM: Are you in need of anything right now?

3616
02:31:24.980 --> 02:31:26.840
MATT: "Gold, primarily."

3617
02:31:26.840 --> 02:31:29.240
LIAM: Yes, yes, we're all in need of gold always.

3618
02:31:29.240 --> 02:31:30.960
Is there any other little thing?

3619
02:31:30.960 --> 02:31:33.084
TRAVIS: Gator skins, bloody manacles.

3620
02:31:33.084 --> 02:31:35.300
SAM: Yeah, that kind of stuff.

3621
02:31:35.300 --> 02:31:36.330
SAM: Gator skins?

3622
02:31:36.330 --> 02:31:38.310
Need any gator skins?

3623
02:31:38.310 --> 02:31:39.510
LIAM: We can afford your price,

3624
02:31:39.510 --> 02:31:41.730
but we have a lot of odds and ends.

3625
02:31:41.730 --> 02:31:43.480
MATT: "Show me this gator skin you have."

3626
02:31:44.770 --> 02:31:45.914
TRAVIS: It's in the bag of holding.

3627
02:31:45.914 --> 02:31:49.770
MARISHA: Oh. (grunts)

3628
02:31:49.770 --> 02:31:52.430
MATT: Now, the gator skin has not been properly tanned,

3629
02:31:52.430 --> 02:31:55.930
so it's pretty gross.
(laughs)

3630
02:31:56.970 --> 02:31:58.838
You pull it out and it's like phew!

3631
02:31:58.838 --> 02:32:00.410
Ooh!

3632
02:32:00.410 --> 02:32:01.243
"Put it back, please.

3633
02:32:01.243 --> 02:32:02.100
"Put it back, put it back."

3634
02:32:02.100 --> 02:32:03.166
MARISHA: Are you sure you don't--

3635
02:32:03.166 --> 02:32:04.157
MATT: "Put it back, please."

3636
02:32:04.157 --> 02:32:05.135
LAURA: Oh, you know what?

3637
02:32:05.135 --> 02:32:06.280
I bet Yarnball would like to eat that.

3638
02:32:06.280 --> 02:32:07.670
We can feed it to them.

3639
02:32:07.670 --> 02:32:10.661
MARISHA: Is this worthless?
MATT: "Probably."

3640
02:32:10.661 --> 02:32:11.770
MARISHA: Eh.

3641
02:32:11.770 --> 02:32:13.968
LAURA: Well, I don't want it now!

3642
02:32:13.968 --> 02:32:16.690
TRAVIS: Didn't we get some jewelry in the nest?

3643
02:32:16.690 --> 02:32:17.523
MARISHA: Yes, I was going to say

3644
02:32:17.523 --> 02:32:18.806
I have those two gold rings.

3645
02:32:18.806 --> 02:32:20.517
LAURA: No, keep those!

3646
02:32:20.517 --> 02:32:22.058
They're so pretty.

3647
02:32:22.058 --> 02:32:23.692
SAM: It's true. They are.

3648
02:32:23.692 --> 02:32:25.333
MARISHA: And the pearl necklace.

3649
02:32:25.333 --> 02:32:27.610
MATT: "350 gold, and for the ivory,

3650
02:32:27.610 --> 02:32:30.320
"for the batch I have, it's 250 you requested, correct?"

3651
02:32:30.320 --> 02:32:32.180
TALIESIN: 200 of the ivory and 250 of the--

3652
02:32:32.180 --> 02:32:34.210
MATT: "Ah, so 250 for the ivory.

3653
02:32:34.210 --> 02:32:36.236
"So together, 600 gold.

3654
02:32:36.236 --> 02:32:38.958
"Call it a deal."

3655
02:32:38.958 --> 02:32:40.369
SAM: Do you need any money?

3656
02:32:40.369 --> 02:32:43.470
LIAM: No, I am good, thank you, Nott.

3657
02:32:43.470 --> 02:32:46.140
200 for the incense for you.
TALIESIN: 200 for the ivory.

3658
02:32:46.140 --> 02:32:47.610
250 for the incense.

3659
02:32:48.590 --> 02:32:51.460
LIAM: That's 50 for incense from me, so 300.

3660
02:32:51.460 --> 02:32:52.677
MARISHA: She's putting on a surcharge.

3661
02:32:52.677 --> 02:32:53.902
LIAM: 500.

3662
02:32:53.902 --> 02:32:55.585
TALIESIN: An extra hundred.

3663
02:32:55.585 --> 02:32:57.980
LIAM: Which is 20%.

3664
02:32:57.980 --> 02:32:59.868
Let's do 15%.

3665
02:33:00.970 --> 02:33:02.270
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

3666
02:33:05.789 --> 02:33:07.500
LIAM: 21.
MATT: 21?

3667
02:33:09.711 --> 02:33:11.711
(sighs)

3668
02:33:15.840 --> 02:33:19.196
"575 and no higher."
LIAM: Deal.

3669
02:33:19.196 --> 02:33:20.130
TALIESIN: I got that.

3670
02:33:20.130 --> 02:33:20.963
I'll cover that.

3671
02:33:20.963 --> 02:33:23.221
575.
LIAM: Oh.

3672
02:33:24.220 --> 02:33:27.900
MATT: So deduct 575, but you get 200 gold worth of ivory,

3673
02:33:27.900 --> 02:33:29.920
250 of incense, and 50 of incense.

3674
02:33:29.920 --> 02:33:30.848
TALIESIN: Yep.

3675
02:33:30.848 --> 02:33:34.173
MARISHA: I would freak out if that happened in-game.

3676
02:33:34.173 --> 02:33:37.143
You just bump into a table and spill a healing potion.

3677
02:33:37.143 --> 02:33:40.560
One thousand gold!
(laughs)

3678
02:33:42.680 --> 02:33:44.493
MATT: So the deal is struck.

3679
02:33:44.493 --> 02:33:45.380
It is paid.

3680
02:33:45.380 --> 02:33:46.640
The materials are yours.

3681
02:33:48.570 --> 02:33:52.120
The male drow, who now after this conversation

3682
02:33:52.120 --> 02:33:55.383
has introduced himself as Delez Demona.

3683
02:33:55.383 --> 02:33:56.418
(foot thumps)
LAURA: Ow!

3684
02:33:57.380 --> 02:34:00.620
TALIESIN: I have one diamond.
LAURA: Okay.

3685
02:34:00.620 --> 02:34:02.311
MATT: He says, "Up top there

3686
02:34:02.311 --> 02:34:04.252
"you will find a series of bunks.

3687
02:34:04.252 --> 02:34:05.680
"Find the ones that are available

3688
02:34:05.680 --> 02:34:10.043
"and take what is at your leisure.

3689
02:34:10.043 --> 02:34:14.290
"It is not comfortable to the highest degree, but it works."

3690
02:34:14.290 --> 02:34:16.357
TRAVIS: Windows up there?

3691
02:34:16.357 --> 02:34:19.930
MATT: "It has some openings upon the roof, yes."

3692
02:34:19.930 --> 02:34:21.180
TRAVIS: On the roof, all right.

3693
02:34:23.800 --> 02:34:25.050
Let's turn in.
SAM: Mm-hmm.

3694
02:34:26.650 --> 02:34:28.420
TRAVIS: We sharing one big, open space,

3695
02:34:28.420 --> 02:34:29.680
like shared bunks in a--

3696
02:34:29.680 --> 02:34:31.540
MATT: If you go up the ladder and check the space,

3697
02:34:31.540 --> 02:34:34.710
you can see there's about seven other individuals

3698
02:34:34.710 --> 02:34:37.222
that are all sleeping in different beddings.

3699
02:34:37.222 --> 02:34:39.090
There's bunks that are set up,

3700
02:34:39.090 --> 02:34:41.384
like small, very basic beds.

3701
02:34:41.384 --> 02:34:43.580
There are a few that are stacked up

3702
02:34:43.580 --> 02:34:45.530
on little steps almost,

3703
02:34:45.530 --> 02:34:47.010
that are little platforms or other bits

3704
02:34:47.010 --> 02:34:49.440
of empty crates are set up there,

3705
02:34:49.440 --> 02:34:51.840
where they're filled with sundries or materials.

3706
02:34:52.713 --> 02:34:54.210
With all of you guys in there,

3707
02:34:54.210 --> 02:34:56.558
it looks like room is made to fit

3708
02:34:56.558 --> 02:34:59.590
maybe 12 people comfortably,

3709
02:34:59.590 --> 02:35:02.432
and you guys are pushing it at 15.

3710
02:35:02.432 --> 02:35:04.980
There aren't quite enough beds for all of you,

3711
02:35:04.980 --> 02:35:07.240
but there are sections in the ground

3712
02:35:07.240 --> 02:35:10.340
where there's heavy leathers and furs

3713
02:35:10.340 --> 02:35:14.608
set aside for either blankets or secondary bedding.

3714
02:35:16.008 --> 02:35:18.818
You can find enough to get comfortably asleep.

3715
02:35:20.181 --> 02:35:22.160
LIAM: But to bunk, not to do anything else.

3716
02:35:22.160 --> 02:35:24.810
Caleb came up here hoping to

3717
02:35:24.810 --> 02:35:26.126
fuck with Find Familiar,

3718
02:35:26.126 --> 02:35:27.726
but that's not going to happen up here.

3719
02:35:27.726 --> 02:35:30.222
MATT: You could, it's just you might draw some attention.

3720
02:35:30.222 --> 02:35:31.055
LIAM: Yeah.

3721
02:35:31.055 --> 02:35:32.930
MARISHA: You mentioned windows in the ceiling.

3722
02:35:32.930 --> 02:35:35.850
MATT: There aren't windows, but parts of the roof,

3723
02:35:35.850 --> 02:35:39.310
there are slots that are open for airflow,

3724
02:35:39.310 --> 02:35:41.230
but arranged so that they're covered on top

3725
02:35:41.230 --> 02:35:44.820
so that rainfall or any other heavy weather effects

3726
02:35:44.820 --> 02:35:47.030
wouldn't just pour in over the top.

3727
02:35:47.030 --> 02:35:47.863
MARISHA: Gotcha.

3728
02:35:47.863 --> 02:35:49.863
MATT: It's enough airflow to keep the interior

3729
02:35:49.863 --> 02:35:51.290
from stagnating too much.

3730
02:35:51.290 --> 02:35:53.942
MARISHA: Is there anything like a balcony or--

3731
02:35:53.942 --> 02:35:54.890
MATT: Not here.

3732
02:35:54.890 --> 02:35:56.150
It's a pretty simple structure, unfortunately.

3733
02:35:56.150 --> 02:35:57.458
TRAVIS: Only way up into this room

3734
02:35:57.458 --> 02:35:58.583
is the way we came, right?

3735
02:35:58.583 --> 02:36:00.420
MATT: Correct, so a hatch with a ladder.

3736
02:36:00.420 --> 02:36:02.160
TRAVIS: I don't feel particularly safe

3737
02:36:02.160 --> 02:36:03.850
having everybody zonk out at once.

3738
02:36:03.850 --> 02:36:05.580
We should probably treat this as a--

3739
02:36:05.580 --> 02:36:06.640
MARISHA: Take watch, yeah.

3740
02:36:08.055 --> 02:36:10.510
SAM: All right.
LAURA: Yeah.

3741
02:36:10.510 --> 02:36:12.735
SAM: I'll take first watch.

3742
02:36:12.735 --> 02:36:15.750
LIAM: I am going to stay up with Nott,

3743
02:36:15.750 --> 02:36:20.104
but use the time to cast Find Familiar,

3744
02:36:21.087 --> 02:36:23.455
bring Frumpkin up as a vulture.

3745
02:36:23.455 --> 02:36:25.610
Before I begin, I say: You know,

3746
02:36:25.610 --> 02:36:28.090
I have seen through your eyes,

3747
02:36:28.090 --> 02:36:29.290
and that was pretty great,

3748
02:36:29.290 --> 02:36:33.064
but I did not quite know how great it was to fly,

3749
02:36:33.064 --> 02:36:34.930
so you have been holding out on me.

3750
02:36:34.930 --> 02:36:36.396
Would you like to be a cat?

3751
02:36:36.396 --> 02:36:39.280
MATT: (squawks)
LIAM: I thought so.

3752
02:36:39.280 --> 02:36:41.267
All right, give me some time.

3753
02:36:41.267 --> 02:36:43.780
Then I spend the next hour with whoever's watching

3754
02:36:43.780 --> 02:36:45.830
to draw a circle in chalk on the floor

3755
02:36:45.830 --> 02:36:48.070
and slowly (whooshing) I have my cat back.

3756
02:36:48.070 --> 02:36:49.330
MATT: Yeah, your cat returns.

3757
02:36:49.330 --> 02:36:53.356
SAM: I will pass the time sipping on my flask.

3758
02:36:53.356 --> 02:36:55.806
MATT: You go reach for your flask and it's not there.

3759
02:36:56.810 --> 02:36:58.651
SAM: I freak the fuck out.

3760
02:36:58.651 --> 02:37:02.451
(laughter)

3761
02:37:02.451 --> 02:37:04.360
TRAVIS: Holy shit!

3762
02:37:05.790 --> 02:37:08.239
SAM: Did you see my flask?

3763
02:37:08.239 --> 02:37:11.280
It's big and platinum, and it's magical

3764
02:37:11.280 --> 02:37:13.490
and has booze in it all the time.

3765
02:37:13.490 --> 02:37:16.100
MARISHA: We've seen it 500 times.

3766
02:37:16.100 --> 02:37:17.190
SAM and LAURA: You're asleep.
MARISHA: Oh.

3767
02:37:17.190 --> 02:37:19.110
MATT: It's the two of them are up.

3768
02:37:19.110 --> 02:37:20.870
SAM: I'm sorry, I don't mean to interrupt your ritual.

3769
02:37:20.870 --> 02:37:22.360
LIAM: You are messing with my flow.

3770
02:37:22.360 --> 02:37:23.193
SAM: Oh, okay.

3771
02:37:23.193 --> 02:37:25.930
But just, have you seen it?
LIAM: I have not seen that flask.

3772
02:37:25.930 --> 02:37:27.596
Oh, shit. I have to start over.

3773
02:37:27.596 --> 02:37:29.160
SAM: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3774
02:37:29.160 --> 02:37:30.690
LIAM: (sighs) No, it's okay.

3775
02:37:30.690 --> 02:37:31.709
What did you lose?

3776
02:37:31.709 --> 02:37:34.470
SAM: Just tell me when the last time you saw it was,

3777
02:37:34.470 --> 02:37:35.650
because I had it today for sure.

3778
02:37:35.650 --> 02:37:38.350
LIAM: You were chugging on it when--

3779
02:37:38.350 --> 02:37:39.940
SAM: That seems likely.

3780
02:37:39.940 --> 02:37:43.380
LIAM: At the base of the tree, I think.

3781
02:37:43.380 --> 02:37:45.130
Well, I would know exactly the last place

3782
02:37:45.130 --> 02:37:47.110
I saw Nott chugging on her flask,

3783
02:37:47.110 --> 02:37:49.930
because of my damn feat.
MATT: Yeah.

3784
02:37:49.930 --> 02:37:52.710
LIAM: Liam doesn't remember.

3785
02:37:52.710 --> 02:37:54.410
SAM: Yes?

3786
02:37:54.410 --> 02:37:56.580
LIAM: I'm asking for Matthew to speak through me,

3787
02:37:56.580 --> 02:37:57.413
because I don't know.

3788
02:37:57.413 --> 02:37:59.450
MATT: I would say it probably would have been

3789
02:38:00.320 --> 02:38:01.250
probably at the base of the tree, yeah,

3790
02:38:01.250 --> 02:38:03.110
as you guys were about to take off and head north.

3791
02:38:03.110 --> 02:38:04.805
MARISHA: You drank in the cave.

3792
02:38:04.805 --> 02:38:07.420
ASHLEY: Yeah, that circle.
MATT: That's right, in the cave.

3793
02:38:07.420 --> 02:38:09.380
TRAVIS: Do you lose your flask often?

3794
02:38:10.890 --> 02:38:15.310
LAURA: You're asleep.
TRAVIS: Fjord's not asking.

3795
02:38:15.310 --> 02:38:18.075
LIAM: That's Travis. Caleb tells you exactly the last place

3796
02:38:18.075 --> 02:38:19.770
that he saw you have it last,

3797
02:38:19.770 --> 02:38:21.280
so it was sometime yesterday.

3798
02:38:22.621 --> 02:38:24.270
Do you think it fell out on the moorbounders

3799
02:38:24.270 --> 02:38:25.103
when we were racing away?

3800
02:38:25.103 --> 02:38:25.936
SAM: I mean, maybe when we were being chased

3801
02:38:25.936 --> 02:38:27.090
by a bird or something.

3802
02:38:29.073 --> 02:38:31.750
Maybe I should just retrace my steps.

3803
02:38:31.750 --> 02:38:33.410
(laughter)

3804
02:38:33.410 --> 02:38:35.840
LIAM: What if?

3805
02:38:35.840 --> 02:38:40.090
What if in this, our post-military town,

3806
02:38:40.090 --> 02:38:42.500
we find you some booze?

3807
02:38:44.094 --> 02:38:47.118
SAM: Endless booze?

3808
02:38:47.118 --> 02:38:48.167
LIAM: I mean, a lot.

3809
02:38:48.167 --> 02:38:49.000
We could probably get a lot.

3810
02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:50.430
We have a bag that holds a lot,

3811
02:38:50.430 --> 02:38:52.700
but we can't go back the way we came

3812
02:38:52.700 --> 02:38:55.200
to find your magic flask.

3813
02:38:55.200 --> 02:38:56.300
SAM: You know what, maybe one of the others

3814
02:38:56.300 --> 02:38:58.340
has it for safe keeping.
LIAM: That's probably it.

3815
02:38:58.340 --> 02:39:00.130
SAM: Yasha is always...

3816
02:39:02.008 --> 02:39:03.877
She seems a little shifty, honestly.

3817
02:39:03.877 --> 02:39:05.380
She's always disappearing.

3818
02:39:05.380 --> 02:39:07.100
LIAM: She strikes me as pretty straight edge.

3819
02:39:07.100 --> 02:39:08.500
SAM: I don't think so.

3820
02:39:08.500 --> 02:39:10.853
She seems like a--
ASHLEY: Straight edge.

3821
02:39:10.853 --> 02:39:13.520
(laughter)

3822
02:39:17.303 --> 02:39:20.303
SAM: I'm going to go to my original flask,

3823
02:39:20.303 --> 02:39:22.128
the non-magic one.

3824
02:39:22.128 --> 02:39:23.008
Anything in there?

3825
02:39:23.008 --> 02:39:24.875
MATT: A little. (liquid sloshing)

3826
02:39:24.875 --> 02:39:28.250
LIAM: Oh, that's so sad.
SAM: Okay, okay.

3827
02:39:28.250 --> 02:39:29.500
MATT: Take enough for a shot.

3828
02:39:31.144 --> 02:39:32.270
LIAM: Nott, it's gone.

3829
02:39:32.270 --> 02:39:33.103
It's gone!

3830
02:39:33.103 --> 02:39:33.936
It's out of drips.

3831
02:39:33.936 --> 02:39:34.769
It's gone.

3832
02:39:36.390 --> 02:39:40.450
SAM: I hate this fucking town.

3833
02:39:40.450 --> 02:39:41.510
LIAM: Help me do this.

3834
02:39:41.510 --> 02:39:43.086
Take your mind off of it, all right?

3835
02:39:43.086 --> 02:39:43.919
SAM: Sure, sure.

3836
02:39:43.919 --> 02:39:46.111
LIAM: Okay, so hold this vulture.

3837
02:39:47.036 --> 02:39:48.836
MATT: (squawks)

3838
02:39:48.836 --> 02:39:50.030
LIAM: Sit in the middle.

3839
02:39:50.030 --> 02:39:51.070
Don't hold it in your lap,

3840
02:39:51.070 --> 02:39:53.340
because I don't want you to fuse with him.

3841
02:39:53.340 --> 02:39:56.133
SAM: What?
(laughter)

3842
02:39:56.133 --> 02:39:57.560
LIAM: Hold him out in front of you.

3843
02:39:57.560 --> 02:39:58.393
SAM: All right.

3844
02:39:58.393 --> 02:39:59.875
LIAM: Okay, plant him on the ground.

3845
02:39:59.875 --> 02:40:03.199
All right, now just hold still for 40 minutes.

3846
02:40:03.199 --> 02:40:04.842
(laughter)

3847
02:40:04.842 --> 02:40:06.620
SAM: I'm an alcoholic!

3848
02:40:09.269 --> 02:40:12.550
MATT: 40 very, very, very difficult minutes go by

3849
02:40:12.550 --> 02:40:15.415
before Frumpkin is returned to the original cat form.

3850
02:40:15.415 --> 02:40:17.910
LIAM: (sighs) I don't say this out loud,

3851
02:40:17.910 --> 02:40:22.150
but I tell Frumpkin: Okay, she is very rough.

3852
02:40:22.150 --> 02:40:23.330
She is missing her booze,

3853
02:40:23.330 --> 02:40:24.970
which you know she likes very well,

3854
02:40:24.970 --> 02:40:27.550
so lay on the charm, start purring,

3855
02:40:27.550 --> 02:40:29.939
and get doing with the kitty biscuits, okay?

3856
02:40:29.939 --> 02:40:32.690
MATT: (purring)

3857
02:40:32.690 --> 02:40:35.257
SAM: Yes, yes! That's nice.

3858
02:40:35.257 --> 02:40:38.635
(laughter)

3859
02:40:38.635 --> 02:40:40.067
Ow, ow!

3860
02:40:40.067 --> 02:40:42.632
MATT: All right, you guys finish your watch.

3861
02:40:42.632 --> 02:40:44.060
Who's taking next watch?

3862
02:40:44.904 --> 02:40:46.990
TALIESIN: I'll go next round.

3863
02:40:48.544 --> 02:40:51.400
I guess I'd see you two going to sleep.

3864
02:40:51.400 --> 02:40:52.991
SAM: Do you have my flask?

3865
02:40:52.991 --> 02:40:54.890
TALIESIN: No.

3866
02:40:54.890 --> 02:40:56.720
SAM: I need it.

3867
02:40:56.720 --> 02:40:58.750
TALIESIN: I can help with a bit of that.

3868
02:40:58.750 --> 02:40:59.770
SAM: Oh?

3869
02:40:59.770 --> 02:41:00.970
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm just going to cast

3870
02:41:00.970 --> 02:41:03.770
Greater Restoration before I pass out.

3871
02:41:03.770 --> 02:41:04.949
LAURA: Before.
MATT: Okay.

3872
02:41:04.949 --> 02:41:06.203
TALIESIN: Yeah.
SAM: Huh.

3873
02:41:06.203 --> 02:41:08.080
MATT: You're fine for the time being.

3874
02:41:08.080 --> 02:41:09.220
SAM: Okay, I'll go to sleep.

3875
02:41:09.220 --> 02:41:11.469
TRAVIS: I'll join Caduceus on the watch.

3876
02:41:11.469 --> 02:41:12.327
MATT: Okay.

3877
02:41:12.327 --> 02:41:13.750
LAURA: Close your eye.

3878
02:41:13.750 --> 02:41:16.058
Close your eye, Sam!

3879
02:41:16.058 --> 02:41:18.263
Stop!
(laughter)

3880
02:41:18.263 --> 02:41:19.190
It's on your nose now.

3881
02:41:19.190 --> 02:41:22.228
LIAM: She's getting you wasted with her fingers.

3882
02:41:22.228 --> 02:41:23.207
LAURA: Stop it!

3883
02:41:23.207 --> 02:41:24.100
Okay, wait.

3884
02:41:24.100 --> 02:41:24.933
Make a wish.

3885
02:41:24.933 --> 02:41:27.690
SAM: I wish you would give me my flask back.

3886
02:41:27.690 --> 02:41:29.726
(laughter)

3887
02:41:29.726 --> 02:41:30.784
Oh, fuck you!

3888
02:41:30.784 --> 02:41:35.184
(laughter)

3889
02:41:35.184 --> 02:41:37.382
TRAVIS: Hey, Caduceus?
TALIESIN: Yeah?

3890
02:41:39.090 --> 02:41:41.960
TRAVIS: So last night when we were sleeping,

3891
02:41:42.890 --> 02:41:46.799
I had this dream, like I do, and--

3892
02:41:46.799 --> 02:41:47.790
TALIESIN: Really?

3893
02:41:47.790 --> 02:41:49.856
TRAVIS: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Huh.

3894
02:41:49.856 --> 02:41:52.900
TRAVIS: Except unlike the previous times

3895
02:41:52.900 --> 02:41:57.625
where I've seen an eye and I felt cold and this darkness,

3896
02:41:58.467 --> 02:42:01.102
I felt warmth

3897
02:42:02.068 --> 02:42:05.626
and I heard a

3898
02:42:05.626 --> 02:42:08.159
matronly voice

3899
02:42:08.159 --> 02:42:10.089
beckoning to me,

3900
02:42:10.089 --> 02:42:13.240
and I saw this greenery, like these vines

3901
02:42:13.240 --> 02:42:15.170
reach out, inviting me forward.

3902
02:42:16.300 --> 02:42:19.260
I can't help but think that might have something

3903
02:42:19.260 --> 02:42:23.193
to do with the tree that we were near?

3904
02:42:24.730 --> 02:42:27.660
TALIESIN: That was hers, and she spoke to me, too.

3905
02:42:27.660 --> 02:42:31.622
TRAVIS: Yeah, who is she again?

3906
02:42:31.622 --> 02:42:36.622
TALIESIN: Well, do you not know anything of the Wildmother?

3907
02:42:38.038 --> 02:42:41.930
TRAVIS: Well, what you've said pretty much.

3908
02:42:41.930 --> 02:42:44.214
TALIESIN: What did she say to you exactly?

3909
02:42:45.139 --> 02:42:50.131
TRAVIS: Well, she said that his will would find me again,

3910
02:42:51.032 --> 02:42:56.032
and that she could only intercede for a short bit,

3911
02:42:57.140 --> 02:43:02.070
maybe because we were so close to the giant fucking tree.

3912
02:43:02.070 --> 02:43:06.669
But that felt really good.

3913
02:43:06.669 --> 02:43:09.902
TALIESIN: That would be her, yeah.

3914
02:43:09.902 --> 02:43:14.897
TRAVIS: What do you do to connect with her?

3915
02:43:16.240 --> 02:43:19.690
TALIESIN: Well, she's everywhere,

3916
02:43:19.690 --> 02:43:23.990
so, I mean, honestly the best things

3917
02:43:23.990 --> 02:43:28.977
to do are to sit still and breathe slowly.

3918
02:43:32.435 --> 02:43:33.838
One of the things I like to do,

3919
02:43:33.838 --> 02:43:35.940
although it's harder to do in a place like this,

3920
02:43:35.940 --> 02:43:39.010
is just slowly count the number of sounds you hear

3921
02:43:39.010 --> 02:43:41.020
and listen for each and every thing

3922
02:43:41.020 --> 02:43:45.190
and start to name what it is as it goes by.

3923
02:43:45.190 --> 02:43:48.140
Slowly you'll see her and feel her

3924
02:43:48.140 --> 02:43:50.420
in everything that is around,

3925
02:43:50.420 --> 02:43:54.345
every plant that's growing, every animal that's hunting.

3926
02:43:57.317 --> 02:43:59.020
While her power may wax and wane

3927
02:43:59.020 --> 02:44:00.370
depending on where we are,

3928
02:44:00.370 --> 02:44:05.370
it is something that's always, nearly always, available.

3929
02:44:05.980 --> 02:44:08.937
TRAVIS: You said she said she's everywhere.

3930
02:44:10.740 --> 02:44:15.380
TALIESIN: We are, I believe, heading to a place

3931
02:44:15.380 --> 02:44:18.520
of power of hers inevitably.

3932
02:44:18.520 --> 02:44:20.030
I think this place will perhaps

3933
02:44:20.030 --> 02:44:21.480
have great importance to you.

3934
02:44:25.070 --> 02:44:25.903
This is good.

3935
02:44:25.903 --> 02:44:26.840
This is very, very good.

3936
02:44:26.840 --> 02:44:30.980
This is another good sign of what's to come.

3937
02:44:30.980 --> 02:44:32.521
TRAVIS: It felt good.

3938
02:44:34.612 --> 02:44:35.850
How did she find you?

3939
02:44:35.850 --> 02:44:38.000
Or did you find her?

3940
02:44:38.000 --> 02:44:40.620
TALIESIN: I was born into it, so...

3941
02:44:40.620 --> 02:44:41.470
TRAVIS: Your family?

3942
02:44:41.470 --> 02:44:44.240
TALIESIN: Yeah, my family going back several generations

3943
02:44:46.300 --> 02:44:49.425
we're one of

3944
02:44:49.425 --> 02:44:52.620
three families of priests who have served her

3945
02:44:52.620 --> 02:44:55.220
through hundreds of years.

3946
02:44:56.160 --> 02:44:58.501
TRAVIS: Any tips you could give to a

3947
02:44:59.518 --> 02:45:04.326
crash course to service?

3948
02:45:05.660 --> 02:45:08.135
I'm really

3949
02:45:10.510 --> 02:45:13.390
anxious to feel that again.

3950
02:45:13.390 --> 02:45:14.640
TALIESIN: That's very good.

3951
02:45:15.680 --> 02:45:17.680
I'm anxious to help you feel that again.

3952
02:45:19.997 --> 02:45:22.715
I have faith in you, Mr. Fjord, I think that--

3953
02:45:25.060 --> 02:45:27.920
I would like to think that you have a shining,

3954
02:45:27.920 --> 02:45:30.100
beautiful destiny ahead of you,

3955
02:45:30.100 --> 02:45:32.340
and I know that there is great darkness in your heart,

3956
02:45:32.340 --> 02:45:35.015
but you have good friends.

3957
02:45:35.015 --> 02:45:36.190
These are good people.

3958
02:45:38.390 --> 02:45:41.600
I know that you're going to be tempted sometimes.

3959
02:45:41.600 --> 02:45:45.720
You're going to follow all the things that you hear,

3960
02:45:45.720 --> 02:45:48.330
but I would just recommend trusting

3961
02:45:48.330 --> 02:45:50.642
in us to take care of you.

3962
02:45:50.642 --> 02:45:52.608
It's all going to be okay.

3963
02:45:54.143 --> 02:45:55.240
TRAVIS: Right.

3964
02:45:55.240 --> 02:45:56.590
Everything's going to be okay.

3965
02:45:56.590 --> 02:45:58.930
TALIESIN: You found a giant tree that silenced

3966
02:45:58.930 --> 02:46:01.260
the evil voices in your head.

3967
02:46:01.260 --> 02:46:03.340
I mean, how probable was that?

3968
02:46:03.340 --> 02:46:06.510
TRAVIS: Any more of those around that you know of?

3969
02:46:08.600 --> 02:46:11.470
TALIESIN: Actually, I'm looking for a mountain.

3970
02:46:12.500 --> 02:46:15.350
Doesn't have any snow,

3971
02:46:15.350 --> 02:46:17.878
in front of a great salt flat.

3972
02:46:19.530 --> 02:46:23.149
Find that, I think we're going to be doing okay.

3973
02:46:23.149 --> 02:46:25.960
TRAVIS: A mountain with no snow.

3974
02:46:25.960 --> 02:46:27.310
TALIESIN: Yeah, if we find that,

3975
02:46:28.315 --> 02:46:31.090
I think that's a sign that things are going pretty well.

3976
02:46:32.020 --> 02:46:35.750
TRAVIS: I need to meditate and count the sounds

3977
02:46:35.750 --> 02:46:37.990
that I hear and give them a name.

3978
02:46:39.010 --> 02:46:40.810
TALIESIN: I find that tends to do it for me.

3979
02:46:44.198 --> 02:46:46.070
MATT: You can make a history check if you want for it.

3980
02:46:46.070 --> 02:46:49.169
TRAVIS: Thank you.

3981
02:46:49.169 --> 02:46:50.952
(groans) Ten.

3982
02:46:50.952 --> 02:46:53.018
MATT: Doesn't ring a bell, what he's talking about.

3983
02:46:53.018 --> 02:46:55.350
TRAVIS: I will try that.

3984
02:46:56.280 --> 02:46:58.588
I'll stay up a little longer,

3985
02:47:00.536 --> 02:47:02.410
try that shit.

3986
02:47:02.410 --> 02:47:04.150
TALIESIN: Do some guided meditation tonight.

3987
02:47:04.150 --> 02:47:05.330
MATT: Okay, all right.

3988
02:47:05.330 --> 02:47:07.060
You guide him through breathing?

3989
02:47:07.060 --> 02:47:09.140
TALIESIN: No, I close meditation, but yeah,

3990
02:47:09.140 --> 02:47:11.905
just going to do a round.
MATT: Okay.

3991
02:47:13.091 --> 02:47:17.087
TRAVIS: My fucking knees don't bend that way, but...

3992
02:47:17.087 --> 02:47:20.049
All right, we'll do it.

3993
02:47:20.049 --> 02:47:22.630
MATT: The wind is picking up through the night,

3994
02:47:22.630 --> 02:47:25.300
and through the slats, bits of red dust

3995
02:47:25.300 --> 02:47:28.840
are starting to plume through a bit.

3996
02:47:28.840 --> 02:47:31.000
The storm didn't hit as hard up north here,

3997
02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:33.471
and as things have dried and the wind's picked up,

3998
02:47:33.471 --> 02:47:36.371
you get the sense that a dust storm is or has been coming.

3999
02:47:37.805 --> 02:47:40.460
The sound of it (wind) clattering through

4000
02:47:40.460 --> 02:47:41.420
has been a little distracting,

4001
02:47:41.420 --> 02:47:43.600
but as you focus with Caduceus,

4002
02:47:43.600 --> 02:47:45.549
eventually the sound begins to fade in you,

4003
02:47:45.549 --> 02:47:49.512
trying to find a center, a place.

4004
02:47:50.900 --> 02:47:55.770
Instead the sound of the wind blowing (heavy winds)

4005
02:47:55.770 --> 02:47:57.620
begins to become more of a

4006
02:47:57.620 --> 02:48:02.595
(waves crashing gently)

4007
02:48:03.625 --> 02:48:04.946
of waves coming onto shore.

4008
02:48:04.946 --> 02:48:07.985
TRAVIS: Ahh!
LAURA: Ooh!

4009
02:48:07.985 --> 02:48:11.339
MATT: It reminds you of growing up by the waters

4010
02:48:11.339 --> 02:48:14.220
on the Menagerie Coast in Port Damali.

4011
02:48:14.220 --> 02:48:17.130
It reminds you of running along the sands of the beach.

4012
02:48:17.130 --> 02:48:18.090
You find yourself sitting there

4013
02:48:18.090 --> 02:48:20.160
and you can feel the warmth of the sunlight on you,

4014
02:48:20.160 --> 02:48:22.320
and looking into the endless expanse of blue waters

4015
02:48:22.320 --> 02:48:25.691
out at the horizon in front of you.

4016
02:48:25.691 --> 02:48:26.960
And for a moment, it's different.

4017
02:48:26.960 --> 02:48:30.350
It's not as strong, but there is a familiar warmth to it.

4018
02:48:30.350 --> 02:48:34.592
You know he said she's everywhere.

4019
02:48:35.750 --> 02:48:37.310
Part of that could be the ocean.

4020
02:48:40.260 --> 02:48:41.513
TRAVIS: Oh. (laughs)

4021
02:48:41.513 --> 02:48:43.663
MATT: You go to sleep very well that night.

4022
02:48:47.120 --> 02:48:49.469
TRAVIS: Okay.
TALIESIN: 15 minutes every day.

4023
02:48:49.469 --> 02:48:53.240
You should download an app.
(laughter)

4024
02:48:56.730 --> 02:48:57.787
MATT: You guys taking last watch?

4025
02:48:57.787 --> 02:49:00.142
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

4026
02:49:00.142 --> 02:49:00.975
Jester, are you watching, or are you--

4027
02:49:00.975 --> 02:49:03.325
LAURA: Sure, yeah. I'll just get up.

4028
02:49:04.999 --> 02:49:07.020
(groans) Oh wait,

4029
02:49:07.020 --> 02:49:08.420
will I get my exhaustion point back

4030
02:49:08.420 --> 02:49:12.090
if I take a watch?
MATT: We'll say yeah.

4031
02:49:12.090 --> 02:49:15.340
You guys are trading off in four-hour blocks

4032
02:49:15.340 --> 02:49:17.430
to keep an eye out, so everyone does it.

4033
02:49:17.430 --> 02:49:18.740
Your exhaustion point will be gone by now.

4034
02:49:18.740 --> 02:49:19.573
LAURA: Great.

4035
02:49:19.573 --> 02:49:21.270
MATT: You slept for a straight, long rest.

4036
02:49:23.593 --> 02:49:28.360
ASHLEY: (sighs) Hi.

4037
02:49:28.360 --> 02:49:31.098
MARISHA: Am I awake too?
LAURA: Yeah, hi.

4038
02:49:31.098 --> 02:49:32.347
MARISHA: Hi.

4039
02:49:33.457 --> 02:49:35.190
Sleeping on the ground.

4040
02:49:35.190 --> 02:49:36.470
I haven't done that in a while.

4041
02:49:36.470 --> 02:49:37.303
LAURA: Yeah.

4042
02:49:37.303 --> 02:49:40.110
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's not very fun to sleep on your back.

4043
02:49:40.110 --> 02:49:41.780
MARISHA: Yeah. (sighs)

4044
02:49:43.188 --> 02:49:44.400
LAURA: Do you guys want me to go to sleep?

4045
02:49:44.400 --> 02:49:45.400
Do you need some alone time,

4046
02:49:45.400 --> 02:49:48.808
or is it okay if I stay up, too?

4047
02:49:48.808 --> 02:49:51.170
MARISHA: No, this is cool.
LAURA: Oh, okay.

4048
02:49:51.170 --> 02:49:54.100
MARISHA: Are you still sleepy?
LAURA: No, no, I'm awake.

4049
02:49:54.100 --> 02:49:54.933
MARISHA: Okay.

4050
02:49:57.585 --> 02:49:59.470
ASHLEY: I'm going to just start looking

4051
02:49:59.470 --> 02:50:01.892
at some of the other people that are sleeping

4052
02:50:01.892 --> 02:50:05.020
that's not in our group.
MATT: Okay, which at this point

4053
02:50:05.020 --> 02:50:06.220
some of them are starting to get up.

4054
02:50:06.220 --> 02:50:08.750
The morning light has begun to come in.

4055
02:50:08.750 --> 02:50:10.984
ASHLEY: I'm standing above them creepily as they wake up.

4056
02:50:10.984 --> 02:50:12.090
(laughter)

4057
02:50:12.090 --> 02:50:14.003
TRAVIS: Big ass fucking sword out.

4058
02:50:14.003 --> 02:50:17.124
Morning. Sleep well?

4059
02:50:17.124 --> 02:50:20.015
ASHLEY: Good morning.

4060
02:50:20.015 --> 02:50:22.088
TRAVIS: Wakey wakey.

4061
02:50:24.689 --> 02:50:27.000
MATT: A lot of them appear to be travelers.

4062
02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:29.620
None of them here are armed like soldiers.

4063
02:50:29.620 --> 02:50:31.300
A lot of them are folks that are probably passing through,

4064
02:50:31.300 --> 02:50:34.316
some either bringing supplies, picking up supplies,

4065
02:50:34.316 --> 02:50:36.217
or have other business here.

4066
02:50:36.217 --> 02:50:38.640
There are only two drow in here.

4067
02:50:38.640 --> 02:50:40.360
The remainder are mostly...

4068
02:50:42.500 --> 02:50:45.660
You saw three gnolls, two bugbears,

4069
02:50:46.781 --> 02:50:49.450
one ogre, and a few goblins as well.

4070
02:50:51.074 --> 02:50:52.390
As they wake up,

4071
02:50:52.390 --> 02:50:53.870
you guys are just keeping watch.

4072
02:50:53.870 --> 02:50:56.460
They gather their things and look

4073
02:50:56.460 --> 02:50:57.790
about this troupe awkwardly

4074
02:50:57.790 --> 02:50:59.790
and then make their way down the ladder.

4075
02:51:03.153 --> 02:51:06.590
LAURA: Should I try to scry on the dude?

4076
02:51:08.572 --> 02:51:09.460
MARISHA: Oh, yeah.
ASHLEY: Yes.

4077
02:51:09.460 --> 02:51:11.343
LAURA: What you think?
ASHLEY: I think so.

4078
02:51:12.450 --> 02:51:14.490
MARISHA: I'll watch for these guys.

4079
02:51:14.490 --> 02:51:16.400
LAURA: Okay, I'll just sit down on the ground

4080
02:51:16.400 --> 02:51:19.990
and give a little old scry.
MATT: Okay.

4081
02:51:19.990 --> 02:51:22.080
You go ahead and you arrange the circle in the space

4082
02:51:22.080 --> 02:51:24.028
you've now become very familiar with.

4083
02:51:24.028 --> 02:51:25.350
A little bit of excitement rises in your chest,

4084
02:51:25.350 --> 02:51:26.430
because each time you do this

4085
02:51:26.430 --> 02:51:28.180
there's an added benefit

4086
02:51:28.180 --> 02:51:31.720
of a brief communion directly with The Traveler.

4087
02:51:31.720 --> 02:51:35.430
As you finish the spell-- okay.

4088
02:51:36.760 --> 02:51:39.270
The hands reach out and take yours,

4089
02:51:39.270 --> 02:51:43.345
and your vision thrusts forward into a cloud of white,

4090
02:51:44.510 --> 02:51:47.350
and finds nothing

4091
02:51:47.350 --> 02:51:48.200
and comes back.

4092
02:51:49.040 --> 02:51:51.200
The hands, still against yours, pull back and fade

4093
02:51:51.200 --> 02:51:53.734
and the voice in your ear goes,

4094
02:51:53.734 --> 02:51:56.198
"Sorry child, not today."

4095
02:51:56.198 --> 02:51:57.656
SAM: Oh no!

4096
02:51:59.608 --> 02:52:01.330
ASHLEY: What did you see?

4097
02:52:01.330 --> 02:52:04.343
LAURA: Well, did it feel the same as when I was pushed away,

4098
02:52:04.343 --> 02:52:07.390
or pushed out of the scry?

4099
02:52:07.390 --> 02:52:09.580
Or did it feel like I just couldn't find him.

4100
02:52:09.580 --> 02:52:14.020
MATT: It felt like the target seemed to resist the spell.

4101
02:52:14.020 --> 02:52:16.596
Made their saving throw.

4102
02:52:16.596 --> 02:52:18.250
LAURA: Damn it!

4103
02:52:18.250 --> 02:52:20.133
I didn't see anything.

4104
02:52:22.057 --> 02:52:24.847
MARISHA: Do we have any other way of tracking this guy?

4105
02:52:24.847 --> 02:52:27.340
LAURA: I mean, I have my Locate spell.

4106
02:52:27.340 --> 02:52:32.280
I could try to maybe locate the crest that he had on him.

4107
02:52:34.330 --> 02:52:36.870
MARISHA: So the one thousand feet one?

4108
02:52:36.870 --> 02:52:38.228
LAURA: Yeah,

4109
02:52:38.228 --> 02:52:41.503
so we'd have to be closer to the mountains, I think.

4110
02:52:43.066 --> 02:52:45.203
ASHLEY: How far are we from...

4111
02:52:45.203 --> 02:52:46.680
TRAVIS: Yeah, how far are we from those towers?

4112
02:52:46.680 --> 02:52:47.960
Hundreds of feet?

4113
02:52:47.960 --> 02:52:49.450
Thousands of feet?

4114
02:52:49.450 --> 02:52:53.590
MATT: You guys are about maybe 700 or so feet

4115
02:52:53.590 --> 02:52:54.620
from the base of the mountain

4116
02:52:54.620 --> 02:52:57.760
where the Umbra Gates are and the towers begin.

4117
02:52:57.760 --> 02:53:01.780
What you saw in your vision was mountain base.

4118
02:53:01.780 --> 02:53:05.000
You didn't see any signs of civilization or towers, yeah.

4119
02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:05.833
LAURA: Yeah.

4120
02:53:05.833 --> 02:53:09.010
I don't think he was near this town.

4121
02:53:09.010 --> 02:53:11.700
It wasn't within my vision.

4122
02:53:11.700 --> 02:53:12.680
TRAVIS: Why did he say to come?

4123
02:53:12.680 --> 02:53:14.239
I'm not up there.

4124
02:53:16.848 --> 02:53:19.888
ASHLEY: What did he say about Bazzoxan again?

4125
02:53:21.530 --> 02:53:22.750
The Tomb under Bazzoxan.

4126
02:53:23.850 --> 02:53:25.250
LAURA: We could try sending him a message

4127
02:53:25.250 --> 02:53:27.140
and let him know that we're here.

4128
02:53:27.140 --> 02:53:28.790
I mean, he told us to come north.

4129
02:53:30.396 --> 02:53:32.685
Right?
ASHLEY: Yeah, he did.

4130
02:53:32.685 --> 02:53:36.240
Should we alert him of our presence?

4131
02:53:37.420 --> 02:53:40.620
MARISHA: It would be actively using you as bait.

4132
02:53:42.317 --> 02:53:43.322
ASHLEY: Yeah.

4133
02:53:43.322 --> 02:53:45.140
MARISHA: I mean, it could get his attention,

4134
02:53:45.140 --> 02:53:49.848
but also it could be incredibly dangerous.

4135
02:53:49.848 --> 02:53:51.110
LAURA: I mean, if he attacks us while we're

4136
02:53:51.110 --> 02:53:52.070
in the middle of the city,

4137
02:53:52.070 --> 02:53:53.390
at least maybe we'll have some

4138
02:53:53.390 --> 02:53:55.408
of the soldiers to help us.

4139
02:53:55.408 --> 02:53:59.506
MARISHA: Yeah.
LAURA: We'll have to go after him.

4140
02:53:59.506 --> 02:54:01.270
MARISHA: Yeah.
ASHLEY: I would be okay with that,

4141
02:54:01.270 --> 02:54:03.290
but I wonder if we should check with everybody else.

4142
02:54:03.290 --> 02:54:04.640
LAURA: Okay, we'll wait till they wake up.

4143
02:54:04.640 --> 02:54:08.140
ASHLEY: Or does that mess up you using something?

4144
02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:11.210
LAURA: Oh, well I already tried to scry,

4145
02:54:11.210 --> 02:54:13.960
so that's kind of a shitty thing.

4146
02:54:15.750 --> 02:54:16.920
No, it's okay.

4147
02:54:16.920 --> 02:54:18.560
That's what I'm here for, you know?

4148
02:54:19.650 --> 02:54:20.560
ASHLEY: Okay.

4149
02:54:20.560 --> 02:54:22.520
Well, we'll ask everyone about it

4150
02:54:22.520 --> 02:54:24.650
and see if that's what they feel comfortable with,

4151
02:54:24.650 --> 02:54:26.240
but I don't think it's a bad idea.

4152
02:54:26.240 --> 02:54:27.073
LAURA: Okay.

4153
02:54:27.073 --> 02:54:28.070
MARISHA: The sun's starting to come up.

4154
02:54:28.070 --> 02:54:29.860
They'll probably wake up soon anyway.

4155
02:54:31.390 --> 02:54:33.460
MATT: Okay, you guys finish your watch then?

4156
02:54:33.460 --> 02:54:35.328
Okay, the rest of you come to consciousness.

4157
02:54:35.328 --> 02:54:37.960
You're the last stragglers up here

4158
02:54:37.960 --> 02:54:42.960
in the top of the Ready Room's barn-like hostel situation.

4159
02:54:44.230 --> 02:54:46.410
You can gather your things and do whatever else you need

4160
02:54:46.410 --> 02:54:50.150
to prepare before getting to the rest of your day.

4161
02:54:50.150 --> 02:54:51.800
MARISHA: I walk to the edge of the door,

4162
02:54:52.950 --> 02:54:56.325
peek downstairs and see if anyone's lingering nearby.

4163
02:54:56.325 --> 02:54:58.830
MATT: There's no one lingering as far as up here,

4164
02:54:58.830 --> 02:55:01.820
but you do see there are two soldiers inside

4165
02:55:01.820 --> 02:55:03.400
that are currently just going through

4166
02:55:03.400 --> 02:55:05.720
and seeing what materials they need, shopping.

4167
02:55:05.720 --> 02:55:07.040
This isn't a very busy place,

4168
02:55:07.040 --> 02:55:09.050
but some people are coming in for some supplies.

4169
02:55:09.050 --> 02:55:11.140
MARISHA: Okay.

4170
02:55:11.140 --> 02:55:13.390
MATT: Gathering some chain, gathering some nails.

4171
02:55:14.490 --> 02:55:15.689
MARISHA: I listen in.

4172
02:55:15.689 --> 02:55:17.980
What does it sound like they're stocking up for,

4173
02:55:17.980 --> 02:55:22.007
those two soldiers?
MATT: Make a perception check.

4174
02:55:22.007 --> 02:55:23.290
LIAM: (whistling) Soldiers!

4175
02:55:23.290 --> 02:55:25.579
MARISHA: Took a few tries for that one.

4176
02:55:25.579 --> 02:55:27.308
MATT: You got it out. You got it out!

4177
02:55:27.308 --> 02:55:29.710
TRAVIS: Why you drinking out of that flask so much?

4178
02:55:29.710 --> 02:55:32.950
MARISHA: It's for Nott.
TRAVIS: That went on a journey.

4179
02:55:32.950 --> 02:55:33.783
MARISHA: It did.

4180
02:55:33.783 --> 02:55:34.770
16.

4181
02:55:34.770 --> 02:55:36.280
What did you say, perception?

4182
02:55:36.280 --> 02:55:37.220
MATT: Yes.

4183
02:55:37.220 --> 02:55:38.750
MARISHA: 19.
MATT: 19, okay.

4184
02:55:38.750 --> 02:55:40.304
You listen in.

4185
02:55:40.304 --> 02:55:41.384
They're not having a conversation about it.

4186
02:55:41.384 --> 02:55:43.060
They know what they want and they're just grabbing it.

4187
02:55:43.060 --> 02:55:44.400
It's more like, "Did you get it?"

4188
02:55:44.400 --> 02:55:45.233
"Yes, no worry."

4189
02:55:45.233 --> 02:55:46.287
"Okay."
MARISHA: Okay.

4190
02:55:46.287 --> 02:55:48.310
MATT: Actually, they would be talking in Undercommon too,

4191
02:55:48.310 --> 02:55:49.400
and even hear what they're saying.

4192
02:55:49.400 --> 02:55:52.320
But it seems casual and nothing of importance.

4193
02:55:52.320 --> 02:55:53.326
MARISHA: Okay.

4194
02:55:53.326 --> 02:55:56.590
TRAVIS: And don't pay attention. (laughs)

4195
02:55:56.590 --> 02:55:58.768
SAM: Hey, Yasha?
ASHLEY: Yeah?

4196
02:55:59.940 --> 02:56:00.773
How's it going?

4197
02:56:00.773 --> 02:56:01.830
SAM: Anything I should know about?

4198
02:56:03.140 --> 02:56:06.791
ASHLEY: Nothing happened last night at all.

4199
02:56:06.791 --> 02:56:08.280
We just talked and--

4200
02:56:08.280 --> 02:56:10.360
SAM: Do you have any other extra items

4201
02:56:10.360 --> 02:56:13.223
that I should be aware about over there?

4202
02:56:13.223 --> 02:56:15.640
TRAVIS: What kind of items?
TALIESIN: What?

4203
02:56:15.640 --> 02:56:17.340
ASHLEY: No idea.
SAM: Why you so curious, Fjord?

4204
02:56:17.340 --> 02:56:18.360
Huh?

4205
02:56:18.360 --> 02:56:19.193
TRAVIS: Well, I just figured--

4206
02:56:19.193 --> 02:56:20.750
SAM: Do you know something about this?

4207
02:56:20.750 --> 02:56:22.360
TALIESIN: About what?

4208
02:56:22.360 --> 02:56:24.635
SAM: Caduceus.
TALIESIN: Yeah?

4209
02:56:24.635 --> 02:56:27.916
SAM: Maybe I've underestimated you.

4210
02:56:27.916 --> 02:56:29.493
TALIESIN: Probably not.

4211
02:56:29.493 --> 02:56:33.540
LIAM: Nott has misplaced her drinking flask.

4212
02:56:33.540 --> 02:56:35.290
SAM: Someone took it!

4213
02:56:35.290 --> 02:56:38.680
LIAM: Yes, she does not remember where she placed it.

4214
02:56:38.680 --> 02:56:40.000
SAM: I had it with me.

4215
02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:40.960
It was on me.

4216
02:56:40.960 --> 02:56:42.790
MARISHA: Wait--
LIAM: Did anyone pick it up?

4217
02:56:42.790 --> 02:56:43.623
MARISHA: Wait.

4218
02:56:43.623 --> 02:56:46.352
I check all my shit.
MATT: Okay.

4219
02:56:46.352 --> 02:56:47.749
MARISHA: Have we been pick pocketed?

4220
02:56:47.749 --> 02:56:49.270
MATT: You go ahead and check your things

4221
02:56:49.270 --> 02:56:51.543
and everything is where you remember it to be.

4222
02:56:51.543 --> 02:56:53.310
(sighing)
TALIESIN: That's good.

4223
02:56:53.310 --> 02:56:54.510
SAM: No, it's not good.

4224
02:56:54.510 --> 02:56:57.309
That means that I was specifically targeted.

4225
02:56:57.309 --> 02:56:59.827
LAURA: Maybe you dropped it, Nott.
ASHLEY: Maybe you just forgot,

4226
02:56:59.827 --> 02:57:03.210
because you got too drunk?
TALIESIN: That is a thing.

4227
02:57:03.210 --> 02:57:05.659
SAM: No, I think more clearly when I'm drunk.

4228
02:57:05.659 --> 02:57:08.320
TALIESIN: Aah...
LAURA: Do you, though?

4229
02:57:08.320 --> 02:57:09.153
MARISHA: We left pretty quickly.

4230
02:57:09.153 --> 02:57:11.020
LAURA: Maybe it fell off you when we got blown back

4231
02:57:11.020 --> 02:57:12.500
by that giant trap you failed to notice.

4232
02:57:12.500 --> 02:57:13.570
SAM: There's only one way to find out.

4233
02:57:13.570 --> 02:57:14.956
We have to go back.

4234
02:57:14.956 --> 02:57:15.789
Back to the cave.

4235
02:57:15.789 --> 02:57:17.580
ASHLEY: Can't you just get a bottle of booze somewhere?

4236
02:57:17.580 --> 02:57:18.980
TRAVIS: Yeah, we can get you drinks in the meantime.

4237
02:57:18.980 --> 02:57:20.150
I mean, your arms look whiter

4238
02:57:20.150 --> 02:57:21.968
than I've seen them in a long time.

4239
02:57:21.968 --> 02:57:24.635
(laughter)

4240
02:57:28.688 --> 02:57:31.910
We got to get you some booze.
SAM: They're a pale cream.

4241
02:57:31.910 --> 02:57:33.560
TRAVIS: Huh?
SAM: They're a pale cream color.

4242
02:57:33.560 --> 02:57:34.948
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah.

4243
02:57:34.948 --> 02:57:38.808
TALIESIN: Blend in with the locals.
TRAVIS: Got to get you hydrated.

4244
02:57:38.808 --> 02:57:40.370
You can see that shit for a mile out.

4245
02:57:40.370 --> 02:57:43.240
That's just dangerous. (laughs)

4246
02:57:43.240 --> 02:57:44.073
Super nova.

4247
02:57:44.073 --> 02:57:48.298
SAM: It's because I need alcohol to ruddy my skin.

4248
02:57:48.298 --> 02:57:51.400
LAURA: I can try giving you a little spell

4249
02:57:51.400 --> 02:57:53.510
to help out with the withdrawals.

4250
02:57:53.510 --> 02:57:55.840
SAM: Is the spell a flask?

4251
02:57:57.950 --> 02:58:01.020
LAURA: No, but you can hold your flask while I cast it.

4252
02:58:01.020 --> 02:58:02.570
SAM: I can't hold my flask!

4253
02:58:02.570 --> 02:58:05.160
LIAM: On the flip side, we are very well off at the moment.

4254
02:58:05.160 --> 02:58:06.880
We have much coin.

4255
02:58:06.880 --> 02:58:09.760
I'm sure they have libations here.

4256
02:58:09.760 --> 02:58:14.570
We could get you traditional booze for now.

4257
02:58:14.570 --> 02:58:17.356
TRAVIS: You've made some strong steps without it, right?

4258
02:58:17.356 --> 02:58:18.550
SAM: What does that mean?

4259
02:58:18.550 --> 02:58:19.383
What do you mean?

4260
02:58:19.383 --> 02:58:21.260
LAURA: You were doing so well without it before.

4261
02:58:21.260 --> 02:58:22.740
SAM: Was I?
LAURA: You were.

4262
02:58:22.740 --> 02:58:24.212
TRAVIS: Yeah.
LAURA: You were, Nott.

4263
02:58:25.054 --> 02:58:26.454
TRAVIS: I actually hadn't noticed that you'd

4264
02:58:26.454 --> 02:58:28.478
started drinking again.

4265
02:58:28.478 --> 02:58:31.615
LIAM, LAURA, and MARISHA: Hmm.
TALIESIN: I had.

4266
02:58:32.548 --> 02:58:34.603
ASHLEY: I mean, there is like a smell.

4267
02:58:34.603 --> 02:58:36.870
TALIESIN: Things have a habit of just exploding

4268
02:58:36.870 --> 02:58:39.990
or going a little awry.
MARISHA: A little louder.

4269
02:58:39.990 --> 02:58:40.823
TALIESIN: Twitchy.

4270
02:58:40.823 --> 02:58:45.005
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's a little louder.
LAURA: Kind of angry sounding.

4271
02:58:45.005 --> 02:58:47.290
SAM: I felt better in the last few days.

4272
02:58:47.290 --> 02:58:49.190
I think we were making some good headway,

4273
02:58:49.190 --> 02:58:51.720
and it was all because of me, no?

4274
02:58:51.720 --> 02:58:52.600
LAURA: No.
TALIESIN: No.

4275
02:58:52.600 --> 02:58:54.607
I mean, there was a lot of--

4276
02:58:54.607 --> 02:58:57.290
SAM: From what I remember, we did really good

4277
02:58:57.290 --> 02:58:58.585
work the last few days.

4278
02:58:58.585 --> 02:59:01.830
TRAVIS: Yep, there was like a cloud that was worthless.

4279
02:59:02.697 --> 02:59:03.670
TALIESIN: Kind of difficult to deal with, really.

4280
02:59:03.670 --> 02:59:04.820
LAURA: You set off a smoke bomb

4281
02:59:04.820 --> 02:59:06.841
and none of us could see through it?

4282
02:59:06.841 --> 02:59:10.185
SAM: I was totally safe, though.

4283
02:59:10.185 --> 02:59:12.581
I thought that was a very strategic move.

4284
02:59:12.581 --> 02:59:14.887
MARISHA: You did cast Feather Fall on us, and that was nice.

4285
02:59:14.887 --> 02:59:17.420
LAURA: That's true.
TRAVIS: Yeah, it saved our hides.

4286
02:59:17.420 --> 02:59:18.590
Big time.
LAURA: Yeah.

4287
02:59:18.590 --> 02:59:20.490
I do remember you screaming a lot

4288
02:59:20.490 --> 02:59:22.111
when the roc was coming to find us,

4289
02:59:22.111 --> 02:59:24.465
and everyone else was hiding really well--

4290
02:59:24.465 --> 02:59:27.203
SAM: Can everyone just talk a little quieter, please?

4291
02:59:27.203 --> 02:59:28.620
(laughter)

4292
02:59:28.620 --> 02:59:30.190
Just a little bit quieter,

4293
02:59:30.190 --> 02:59:32.480
because I feel like you're all shouting right now very loud.

4294
02:59:32.480 --> 02:59:36.304
It's hurting my ears, giving me a headache.

4295
02:59:36.304 --> 02:59:38.162
LIAM: We're down in the common room right now?

4296
02:59:38.162 --> 02:59:41.204
TRAVIS: I'm sure downstairs we can find a bottle of--

4297
02:59:41.204 --> 02:59:43.780
LAURA: Well maybe, though, it's nice if you--

4298
02:59:43.780 --> 02:59:46.819
SAM: Yasha, if you stole it, I will fucking kill you.

4299
02:59:46.819 --> 02:59:48.580
ASHLEY: I didn't fucking steal it, Nott.

4300
02:59:48.580 --> 02:59:50.692
SAM: Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

4301
02:59:50.692 --> 02:59:53.177
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to speak out of turn.

4302
02:59:53.177 --> 02:59:54.010
TALIESIN: Yeah!

4303
02:59:54.010 --> 02:59:58.456
TRAVIS: Sun's out, guns out.
(laughter)

4304
02:59:58.456 --> 03:00:01.047
ASHLEY and TRAVIS: (screams)

4305
03:00:01.047 --> 03:00:01.880
SAM: I'm okay!

4306
03:00:03.146 --> 03:00:04.529
MARISHA: Well, Nott, you've had that flask

4307
03:00:04.529 --> 03:00:05.612
since the beginning.

4308
03:00:05.612 --> 03:00:08.610
You got that enchanted when we were dirt poor

4309
03:00:08.610 --> 03:00:10.170
and just fighting gnolls, so--

4310
03:00:10.170 --> 03:00:12.640
SAM: I can go back to my original flask I guess for a while.

4311
03:00:12.640 --> 03:00:14.681
MARISHA: Yeah, and you can maybe

4312
03:00:14.681 --> 03:00:16.622
just give it some time and then--

4313
03:00:16.622 --> 03:00:18.190
LIAM: We'll get you some bottles.

4314
03:00:18.190 --> 03:00:19.023
MARISHA: If you feel up to it,

4315
03:00:19.023 --> 03:00:22.231
you can get it enchanted later when we're at--

4316
03:00:22.231 --> 03:00:23.256
TRAVIS: Plus, if you really miss it,

4317
03:00:23.256 --> 03:00:25.748
Jester can just scry on it for you.

4318
03:00:25.748 --> 03:00:27.090
SAM: Oh, yes!

4319
03:00:27.090 --> 03:00:28.750
Don't you have a Locate Object spell?

4320
03:00:28.750 --> 03:00:31.617
TALIESIN: I feel like we should perhaps hold off on that.

4321
03:00:31.617 --> 03:00:32.558
SAM: Could you do it?

4322
03:00:32.558 --> 03:00:36.250
Because if it's close, you could find it for me right away.

4323
03:00:36.250 --> 03:00:37.390
LAURA: Yeah, I could!
SAM: Go ahead!

4324
03:00:37.390 --> 03:00:40.345
LIAM: It would have to be right nearby though, wouldn't it?

4325
03:00:40.345 --> 03:00:41.920
LAURA: It would have to be within a thousand feet.

4326
03:00:41.920 --> 03:00:43.680
TRAVIS: And we've been traveling for hours.

4327
03:00:43.680 --> 03:00:45.287
SAM: Go ahead!

4328
03:00:45.287 --> 03:00:46.800
LAURA: I could, but do you really want me

4329
03:00:46.800 --> 03:00:48.730
to waste that spell slot?
SAM: Yes, I do.

4330
03:00:48.730 --> 03:00:49.563
MARISHA: Nott, no.

4331
03:00:49.563 --> 03:00:51.829
TRAVIS: We're looking for somebody.

4332
03:00:51.829 --> 03:00:53.667
MARISHA: Wow, you got a little crazy eye going.

4333
03:00:53.667 --> 03:00:54.500
Oh, man.

4334
03:00:54.500 --> 03:00:55.880
TRAVIS: That right eye got here a little faster

4335
03:00:55.880 --> 03:00:57.589
than the left one did.
MARISHA: Yeah, it did.

4336
03:00:57.589 --> 03:01:00.960
LIAM and TRAVIS: (gears spinning)

4337
03:01:00.960 --> 03:01:05.960
MARISHA: Look, you were number one in reminding us

4338
03:01:06.239 --> 03:01:09.090
of the task at hand.

4339
03:01:09.090 --> 03:01:09.923
Damn it!

4340
03:01:11.813 --> 03:01:15.920
LAURA: I'm going to cast Lesser Restoration on Nott

4341
03:01:15.920 --> 03:01:19.433
to try to help calm her down.

4342
03:01:19.433 --> 03:01:20.680
MATT: It alleviates some of the--

4343
03:01:20.680 --> 03:01:22.700
LAURA: Maybe take some of the headache away.

4344
03:01:22.700 --> 03:01:23.980
SAM: That feels better.

4345
03:01:23.980 --> 03:01:25.463
Thank you.
LAURA: You're welcome.

4346
03:01:25.463 --> 03:01:26.810
SAM: Thank you, Jessie.

4347
03:01:26.810 --> 03:01:28.330
LAURA: I just want you to feel better.

4348
03:01:28.330 --> 03:01:30.350
LIAM: I'm also quietly going to go find the brother

4349
03:01:30.350 --> 03:01:32.210
and sister that run this place.

4350
03:01:32.210 --> 03:01:36.390
Do you have any spirits available?

4351
03:01:36.390 --> 03:01:38.790
Whiskey, fire whiskey, anything.

4352
03:01:38.790 --> 03:01:41.570
MATT: "Yes, that can be acquired, yes."

4353
03:01:41.570 --> 03:01:43.180
LIAM: Three bottles, please.
MATT: "Three bottles?"

4354
03:01:43.180 --> 03:01:45.310
LIAM: Yes, please.
MATT: "45 gold."

4355
03:01:45.310 --> 03:01:48.131
LIAM: Say that again?
MATT: "45 gold."

4356
03:01:48.131 --> 03:01:50.020
TRAVIS: That's so good.

4357
03:01:50.020 --> 03:01:51.670
LIAM: Is it hard to come by out here?

4358
03:01:54.720 --> 03:01:55.760
That's a yes, okay.

4359
03:01:55.760 --> 03:01:56.996
One bottle.

4360
03:01:56.996 --> 03:02:01.317
One bottle.
MATT: "15 gold."

4361
03:02:01.317 --> 03:02:04.390
LIAM: Okay, thank you.
MATT: "All right."

4362
03:02:04.390 --> 03:02:06.480
LIAM: I store it away.
TALIESIN: How much?

4363
03:02:06.480 --> 03:02:09.715
TRAVIS: How much, 15 gold?
TALIESIN: 15 gold.

4364
03:02:09.715 --> 03:02:13.171
LIAM: It'll be $800, sir.

4365
03:02:13.171 --> 03:02:15.020
TALIESIN: Did you know that what is considered

4366
03:02:15.020 --> 03:02:17.470
a modest lifestyle is one gold a day?

4367
03:02:17.470 --> 03:02:18.303
Just saying.

4368
03:02:18.303 --> 03:02:20.254
That's one gold a day for a modest lifestyle.

4369
03:02:20.254 --> 03:02:21.087
MATT: Yeah.

4370
03:02:21.087 --> 03:02:22.550
A fine bottle of wine costs you ten gold.

4371
03:02:22.550 --> 03:02:23.640
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4372
03:02:23.640 --> 03:02:25.940
TRAVIS: That sand hide kheg thing was

4373
03:02:27.150 --> 03:02:28.930
120 gold a bottle.
MATT: Yeah.

4374
03:02:28.930 --> 03:02:30.180
That stuff was super rare.

4375
03:02:30.180 --> 03:02:31.680
TALIESIN: Just putting that out there.

4376
03:02:35.380 --> 03:02:37.390
MATT: It's a dark brown glass bottle,

4377
03:02:37.390 --> 03:02:39.881
about maybe that big or so,

4378
03:02:39.881 --> 03:02:42.790
corked top wrapped in a rope around the base of it.

4379
03:02:42.790 --> 03:02:44.211
There's no label, none.

4380
03:02:44.211 --> 03:02:45.860
TRAVIS: Jesus, you're going to go blind.

4381
03:02:47.350 --> 03:02:49.250
MATT: That's some strong shit.

4382
03:02:52.237 --> 03:02:53.570
LIAM: (exhales sharply) Yeah.

4383
03:02:53.570 --> 03:02:55.920
LIAM: Numbed your tongue on contact. (laughs)

4384
03:02:55.920 --> 03:02:56.753
TALIESIN: Fireball.

4385
03:02:56.753 --> 03:02:57.586
TRAVIS: It's just petroleum.

4386
03:02:58.828 --> 03:03:00.850
TALIESIN: Originally called Cast Fireball.

4387
03:03:00.850 --> 03:03:03.142
(laughter)

4388
03:03:04.488 --> 03:03:07.478
LAURA: Don't set off a fire spell near you.

4389
03:03:07.478 --> 03:03:09.960
TRAVIS: Head downstairs where the brother and sister are.

4390
03:03:09.960 --> 03:03:11.220
MATT: Anything else you guys want to do?

4391
03:03:11.220 --> 03:03:13.240
You guys head on down and gather the rest of the group.

4392
03:03:13.240 --> 03:03:15.081
MARISHA: Oh, should we mention

4393
03:03:15.081 --> 03:03:16.989
the plan that we potentially had

4394
03:03:16.989 --> 03:03:18.370
before we go out into public?

4395
03:03:18.370 --> 03:03:21.510
ASHLEY: Well, we were thinking that maybe Jessie would...

4396
03:03:23.323 --> 03:03:25.520
MARISHA: Message Obann.

4397
03:03:25.520 --> 03:03:27.063
TRAVIS: Oh.
TALIESIN: That feels a little--

4398
03:03:27.063 --> 03:03:29.027
TRAVIS: Well, and say what?

4399
03:03:29.027 --> 03:03:30.910
LAURA: And say we're here.

4400
03:03:30.910 --> 03:03:32.940
LIAM: Yeah, let's think about this.

4401
03:03:32.940 --> 03:03:36.576
It could be useful, but let's think about this.

4402
03:03:36.576 --> 03:03:39.580
MARISHA: He had interest in Yasha,

4403
03:03:39.580 --> 03:03:43.861
and made it very clear to come and find him.

4404
03:03:43.861 --> 03:03:45.970
There might be a way that we can

4405
03:03:45.970 --> 03:03:48.990
sort of use Yasha as bait, and maybe--

4406
03:03:48.990 --> 03:03:51.195
LIAM: Extend the invitation.
LAURA: Yeah.

4407
03:03:51.195 --> 03:03:53.760
MARISHA: Then just be super prepared

4408
03:03:53.760 --> 03:03:55.200
for anything that might arise.

4409
03:03:55.200 --> 03:03:58.729
TALIESIN: Well, the trouble with that is that I'm just

4410
03:03:58.729 --> 03:04:00.880
imagining it from our end of things.

4411
03:04:00.880 --> 03:04:03.780
If the situation were reversed

4412
03:04:03.780 --> 03:04:05.904
and we were bringing someone in,

4413
03:04:05.904 --> 03:04:10.362
probably just

4414
03:04:10.362 --> 03:04:12.462
(slicing) take them one way.

4415
03:04:13.637 --> 03:04:14.922
I feel like it would give them an awful lot

4416
03:04:14.922 --> 03:04:19.550
of time to prepare and make plans, set traps.

4417
03:04:21.634 --> 03:04:22.910
It's like having an extra day

4418
03:04:22.910 --> 03:04:24.840
to clean your house when someone comes over.

4419
03:04:24.840 --> 03:04:28.344
MARISHA: That's why we do it on our terms, on our grounds.

4420
03:04:28.344 --> 03:04:30.220
TALIESIN: This is definitely not our grounds.

4421
03:04:30.220 --> 03:04:31.980
TRAVIS: We are lacking in direction at this point.

4422
03:04:31.980 --> 03:04:33.670
LIAM: Yeah, we are out of options.

4423
03:04:33.670 --> 03:04:34.970
He is out of range.

4424
03:04:34.970 --> 03:04:36.788
We don't where he is.

4425
03:04:36.788 --> 03:04:38.555
MARISHA: He is at the base of mountains.

4426
03:04:38.555 --> 03:04:41.170
We have been driving by mountains.

4427
03:04:41.170 --> 03:04:42.460
LAURA: That was a couple days ago.

4428
03:04:42.460 --> 03:04:45.213
MARISHA: There are mountains for miles.

4429
03:04:45.213 --> 03:04:47.866
TALIESIN: He's going underneath the temple, if I recall.

4430
03:04:48.833 --> 03:04:52.101
MARISHA: But we don't know.
LAURA: We don't know that for sure.

4431
03:04:52.101 --> 03:04:56.072
TRAVIS: Tomb under--
ASHLEY: Tomb under Bazzoxan.

4432
03:04:56.072 --> 03:04:57.220
TALIESIN: That's where I would check.

4433
03:04:57.220 --> 03:04:59.530
TRAVIS: The soldier did say there were tunnels underneath.

4434
03:04:59.530 --> 03:05:02.320
ASHLEY: Tunnels, the Angel of Irons delivering a crest.

4435
03:05:03.330 --> 03:05:07.500
MARISHA: He also said that there were abyssal horrors

4436
03:05:07.500 --> 03:05:09.680
coming out of that temple.

4437
03:05:09.680 --> 03:05:11.788
TRAVIS: Good thing we're on the case.

4438
03:05:11.788 --> 03:05:14.000
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (imitating rock guitars)

4439
03:05:14.000 --> 03:05:16.794
TRAVIS: So how about we head underneath the tunnels,

4440
03:05:16.794 --> 03:05:18.290
or head underneath the city

4441
03:05:18.290 --> 03:05:20.288
and see where those tunnels lead?

4442
03:05:20.288 --> 03:05:22.321
TALIESIN: Maybe talk to a

4443
03:05:22.321 --> 03:05:26.520
couple people of import in the city,

4444
03:05:26.520 --> 03:05:29.281
see if they know anything about tombs

4445
03:05:29.281 --> 03:05:30.860
under the temple and whether or not

4446
03:05:30.860 --> 03:05:33.400
this character has been around.

4447
03:05:33.400 --> 03:05:34.233
TRAVIS: I dig it.

4448
03:05:34.233 --> 03:05:35.066
MARISHA: I mean, it sounds

4449
03:05:35.066 --> 03:05:37.159
like this entire place is a tomb, though.

4450
03:05:37.159 --> 03:05:40.100
That guy mentioned that it was, or you read

4451
03:05:40.100 --> 03:05:42.278
It was a multilevel--

4452
03:05:42.278 --> 03:05:45.522
LAURA: Temple to the old Betrayer Gods.

4453
03:05:45.522 --> 03:05:48.969
Yeah, the demonic princes from--

4454
03:05:48.969 --> 03:05:50.881
MARISHA: Yeah, that sounds intense.

4455
03:05:50.881 --> 03:05:51.770
LAURA: Or something.

4456
03:05:51.770 --> 03:05:53.840
TRAVIS: I think he said the Abyss.

4457
03:05:53.840 --> 03:05:54.770
LAURA: The Abyss, yeah.

4458
03:05:54.770 --> 03:05:56.970
TALIESIN: Maybe someone knows if some particular,

4459
03:05:56.970 --> 03:06:00.850
if there's a particular tomb.

4460
03:06:00.850 --> 03:06:02.030
Tombs are very specific.

4461
03:06:02.030 --> 03:06:06.310
Tombs have people or things in them.

4462
03:06:06.310 --> 03:06:08.940
That's the whole point of the tomb is to keep something.

4463
03:06:08.940 --> 03:06:10.560
TRAVIS: Should I go out and find somebody

4464
03:06:10.560 --> 03:06:12.260
that knows the entrance to these tunnels?

4465
03:06:12.260 --> 03:06:14.519
LIAM: Yeah, ask if it's even allowed for civilians,

4466
03:06:14.519 --> 03:06:17.530
people outside of the Aurora Watch to go there,

4467
03:06:17.530 --> 03:06:20.330
and what we can expect.

4468
03:06:20.330 --> 03:06:22.629
TALIESIN: We're not civilians to be fair, at the moment.

4469
03:06:23.571 --> 03:06:25.995
TRAVIS: I bet it's allowed of the favored of the Bright--

4470
03:06:25.995 --> 03:06:27.395
(pen clatters)
the Bright Queen.

4471
03:06:27.395 --> 03:06:29.440
(laughter)

4472
03:06:29.440 --> 03:06:30.590
TALIESIN: Maybe you dropped it.

4473
03:06:32.723 --> 03:06:34.770
LIAM: Breaks into three pieces.

4474
03:06:34.770 --> 03:06:36.991
TALIESIN: It was chocolate the whole time!

4475
03:06:36.991 --> 03:06:40.250
(laughter)

4476
03:06:40.250 --> 03:06:44.323
TRAVIS: Somebody else give me theirs.

4477
03:06:44.323 --> 03:06:48.717
LIAM: Oh, my Hanukkah coins. No!

4478
03:06:48.717 --> 03:06:51.117
TRAVIS: I got this. I walk outside.

4479
03:06:51.117 --> 03:06:52.800
MATT: All right, you go outside.

4480
03:06:52.800 --> 03:06:54.467
TRAVIS: Do I see any particular soldiers

4481
03:06:54.467 --> 03:06:57.960
with extra plumage to denote a higher rank?

4482
03:06:57.960 --> 03:07:01.543
MATT: Make a perception check.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4483
03:07:02.979 --> 03:07:05.230
All right. Oh, 21.
MATT: 21, nice.

4484
03:07:05.230 --> 03:07:08.240
Well first off, the winds have been picking up consistently,

4485
03:07:08.240 --> 03:07:10.270
and now you can see there are large,

4486
03:07:10.270 --> 03:07:12.420
kind of reddish dust clouds that are building up

4487
03:07:12.420 --> 03:07:16.073
on the eastern side, moving west and blowing this way,

4488
03:07:16.073 --> 03:07:18.450
both in the Barbed Fields and coming through the city.

4489
03:07:19.517 --> 03:07:22.690
Pieces of material and flags and various markings

4490
03:07:22.690 --> 03:07:24.020
that are hanging from nearby roofs

4491
03:07:24.020 --> 03:07:26.750
are (flapping) whipping in the wind,

4492
03:07:26.750 --> 03:07:28.550
and a couple points, and the blast gets

4493
03:07:28.550 --> 03:07:30.220
to you and you cover your eyes a bit.

4494
03:07:30.220 --> 03:07:32.330
Looking through, you do see

4495
03:07:32.330 --> 03:07:36.340
on the outskirts of the large expanding barracks,

4496
03:07:36.340 --> 03:07:38.290
you can see one soldier who's in the process

4497
03:07:38.290 --> 03:07:40.220
of running a drill for other soldiers

4498
03:07:40.220 --> 03:07:43.090
that are going through shield and sword practice,

4499
03:07:43.090 --> 03:07:47.024
moving forward with phalanx maneuvers, shouting out orders.

4500
03:07:47.024 --> 03:07:49.080
They finish up within a few minutes

4501
03:07:49.080 --> 03:07:50.810
and they take a break as they walk off.

4502
03:07:50.810 --> 03:07:52.420
That person walks off to the side

4503
03:07:52.420 --> 03:07:55.960
and begins eating a bit of, looks like a jerky snack out

4504
03:07:55.960 --> 03:07:57.988
of a pouch and notices you out in the open.

4505
03:07:57.988 --> 03:07:59.010
TRAVIS: Yeah, I approach him.

4506
03:07:59.010 --> 03:08:00.895
Say you there!

4507
03:08:00.895 --> 03:08:02.145
MATT: "Yeah?"

4508
03:08:02.145 --> 03:08:03.320
TRAVIS: On business of the Bright Queen.

4509
03:08:03.320 --> 03:08:06.638
We've been sent to explore the tunnels underneath Bazzoxan.

4510
03:08:06.638 --> 03:08:09.730
What do you know about, fucking...

4511
03:08:09.730 --> 03:08:14.730
What do you know about a tomb underneath this area?

4512
03:08:15.000 --> 03:08:15.833
SAM: This is terrible.

4513
03:08:15.833 --> 03:08:17.600
MATT: Make a persuasion check, first off.

4514
03:08:19.690 --> 03:08:22.440
With advantage with the badge.

4515
03:08:22.440 --> 03:08:24.303
LAURA: Yeah!
TALIESIN: Yes!

4516
03:08:24.303 --> 03:08:25.680
MATT: Because it's on official duty.

4517
03:08:25.680 --> 03:08:26.610
TRAVIS: That's not as great.

4518
03:08:26.610 --> 03:08:28.298
16.
MATT: 16, he goes,

4519
03:08:28.298 --> 03:08:32.110
"I don't really know anything about any tombs,

4520
03:08:32.110 --> 03:08:34.901
"but there are old halls."

4521
03:08:36.210 --> 03:08:37.051
TRAVIS: Hollis?

4522
03:08:37.051 --> 03:08:39.364
MATT: "Old halls."
TRAVIS: Oh.

4523
03:08:39.364 --> 03:08:42.906
MATT: "Places of dominion for the demonic princes,

4524
03:08:42.906 --> 03:08:45.306
"but no tombs."

4525
03:08:45.306 --> 03:08:46.270
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4526
03:08:46.270 --> 03:08:47.930
We're going to need to get into those tunnels.

4527
03:08:47.930 --> 03:08:49.048
How do we get there?

4528
03:08:49.048 --> 03:08:51.525
MATT: "You're going into the tunnels?"

4529
03:08:51.525 --> 03:08:52.810
TRAVIS: That's our job.

4530
03:08:54.080 --> 03:08:55.790
MATT: "You are crazy."

4531
03:08:55.790 --> 03:08:58.960
TRAVIS: Yeah, well, it's not exactly a reward.

4532
03:08:58.960 --> 03:09:00.660
Shit detail, you know what I mean?

4533
03:09:03.330 --> 03:09:07.289
MATT: "Well, there is a side entrance beyond,

4534
03:09:07.289 --> 03:09:09.880
"to the right of the Umbra Gates.

4535
03:09:10.750 --> 03:09:12.990
"It's been nice knowing you."
TRAVIS: To the right?

4536
03:09:12.990 --> 03:09:14.270
Any others?

4537
03:09:14.270 --> 03:09:15.420
MATT: "That is the only formal one.

4538
03:09:15.420 --> 03:09:17.090
"They've closed off all exits to make sure

4539
03:09:17.090 --> 03:09:18.960
"that anything that comes through

4540
03:09:18.960 --> 03:09:21.800
"is forced through a specific exit."

4541
03:09:21.800 --> 03:09:23.290
TRAVIS: Have you seen the tunnels yourself?

4542
03:09:23.290 --> 03:09:24.580
Are they wide, singular?

4543
03:09:24.580 --> 03:09:26.470
I mean, any kind of preview you can

4544
03:09:26.470 --> 03:09:28.560
give me would be much appreciated.

4545
03:09:28.560 --> 03:09:30.980
MATT: "I've been no more than maybe 200 feet within.

4546
03:09:30.980 --> 03:09:35.890
"There is a specific main cavernous chamber

4547
03:09:35.890 --> 03:09:38.190
"that splits off into many, many tunnels."

4548
03:09:38.190 --> 03:09:39.084
TRAVIS: Shit.

4549
03:09:39.084 --> 03:09:43.042
MATT: "They can come from any of them, so we hold it."

4550
03:09:43.042 --> 03:09:44.269
TRAVIS: Right.

4551
03:09:44.269 --> 03:09:48.360
Not a lot of expeditions deep within, huh?

4552
03:09:48.360 --> 03:09:51.228
MATT: "None have returned."
TRAVIS: Yeah, good odds.

4553
03:09:51.228 --> 03:09:52.340
Good story.

4554
03:09:52.340 --> 03:09:53.173
All right, good shit.

4555
03:09:53.173 --> 03:09:55.833
What was your name?
MATT: "Lianos."

4556
03:09:55.833 --> 03:09:57.510
TRAVIS: Dianos?
MATT: "Lianos."

4557
03:09:57.510 --> 03:09:58.770
TRAVIS: Lianos.

4558
03:09:58.770 --> 03:09:59.603
Name's Fjord.

4559
03:09:59.603 --> 03:10:00.960
Nice to meet ya.

4560
03:10:01.847 --> 03:10:06.647
You keep up the good (inhales sharply) work here.

4561
03:10:06.647 --> 03:10:08.400
All right, have a good one.

4562
03:10:09.777 --> 03:10:11.460
MATT: "Be safe. Light protect you."

4563
03:10:11.460 --> 03:10:12.940
TRAVIS: Yeah, light be with you.

4564
03:10:12.940 --> 03:10:15.390
Fuck! (sighs)

4565
03:10:15.390 --> 03:10:16.420
LAURA: So what happened?

4566
03:10:16.420 --> 03:10:17.990
TRAVIS: The entrance to the tunnels

4567
03:10:17.990 --> 03:10:19.940
is to the right of the Umbra Gates.

4568
03:10:22.150 --> 03:10:25.350
This sergeant-ish fellow had only been

4569
03:10:25.350 --> 03:10:26.776
about 200 feet within.

4570
03:10:26.776 --> 03:10:28.830
Most people don't come back.

4571
03:10:28.830 --> 03:10:29.720
MARISHA: Oh, wait, that guy?

4572
03:10:29.720 --> 03:10:30.830
That guy you were just talking to?

4573
03:10:30.830 --> 03:10:32.260
TRAVIS: Yeah, that guy.
MARISHA: He's really buff.

4574
03:10:32.260 --> 03:10:33.093
TRAVIS: I know.

4575
03:10:33.093 --> 03:10:34.030
Well, I mean, yeah.
MARISHA: He's a big guy.

4576
03:10:34.030 --> 03:10:36.530
TRAVIS: You should see the vascularity in his neck alone.

4577
03:10:36.530 --> 03:10:37.578
You can tell the guy eats well.

4578
03:10:37.578 --> 03:10:38.848
LAURA: Yeah, but we got magic, guys.

4579
03:10:38.848 --> 03:10:40.189
LIAM: He's much bigger than you.

4580
03:10:40.189 --> 03:10:41.660
TALIESIN: Yeah. Have to work out a lot.

4581
03:10:41.660 --> 03:10:43.093
ASHLEY: But he's not bigger than me.

4582
03:10:43.093 --> 03:10:44.526
LAURA: You're really big, too.

4583
03:10:45.540 --> 03:10:47.430
TRAVIS: Anyway.
LAURA: Guys! You're so muscly.

4584
03:10:47.430 --> 03:10:49.410
TRAVIS: He says most things that go in don't come back,

4585
03:10:49.410 --> 03:10:53.636
but it scatters into multiple tunnels.

4586
03:10:53.636 --> 03:10:55.330
TALIESIN: I mean, there's a lot of assumption in that.

4587
03:10:55.330 --> 03:10:56.163
LAURA: There's tone.

4588
03:10:56.163 --> 03:10:56.996
You can see the tone.

4589
03:10:58.640 --> 03:11:01.950
SAM: I mean, a little bit.

4590
03:11:03.280 --> 03:11:06.030
TRAVIS: I push my biceps out.

4591
03:11:06.030 --> 03:11:07.990
Look, it's not important.

4592
03:11:07.990 --> 03:11:10.957
What we need to focus on is that he had not heard

4593
03:11:10.957 --> 03:11:15.300
of any tombs or anything like that.

4594
03:11:15.300 --> 03:11:19.940
It was just tunnels, and that it was real dangerous.

4595
03:11:19.940 --> 03:11:21.290
TALIESIN: Wow, that's a--

4596
03:11:21.290 --> 03:11:23.090
ASHLEY: Do you have scratch on the back of your neck?

4597
03:11:23.090 --> 03:11:23.923
TALIESIN: You all right?

4598
03:11:23.923 --> 03:11:24.756
Do you need a--
TRAVIS: Nope.

4599
03:11:24.756 --> 03:11:26.810
(laughter)

4600
03:11:30.953 --> 03:11:33.331
TALIESIN: I mean, there's a lot of assumptions in that,

4601
03:11:33.331 --> 03:11:34.890
like that they're assuming that none

4602
03:11:34.890 --> 03:11:37.570
of these other entrances have been recently breached,

4603
03:11:37.570 --> 03:11:38.920
which they might have been.

4604
03:11:40.527 --> 03:11:42.230
Have you thought about how we're going to sneak in?

4605
03:11:42.230 --> 03:11:44.340
SAM: Why are we going in the tombs again?

4606
03:11:44.340 --> 03:11:46.680
TALIESIN: Were going to find--
LAURA: Find Obann.

4607
03:11:46.680 --> 03:11:48.745
SAM: You said that when you saw Obann he was outside

4608
03:11:48.745 --> 03:11:50.770
near the base of a mountain,

4609
03:11:50.770 --> 03:11:52.840
not in a tomb under the mountain.

4610
03:11:52.840 --> 03:11:53.820
TRAVIS: We're looking for someplace.

4611
03:11:53.820 --> 03:11:55.470
TALIESIN: Probably not still at the base of a mountain.

4612
03:11:55.470 --> 03:11:56.303
LAURA: It looked like he was looking

4613
03:11:56.303 --> 03:11:59.290
for some sort of secret entrance or something.

4614
03:11:59.290 --> 03:12:02.905
TRAVIS: Probably to get under the (humming).

4615
03:12:02.905 --> 03:12:06.360
LAURA: Maybe he knows about a way that isn't as dangerous.

4616
03:12:06.360 --> 03:12:08.591
SAM: But you said he was searching for it.

4617
03:12:08.591 --> 03:12:11.697
ASHLEY: He was delivering a crest for what?

4618
03:12:11.697 --> 03:12:12.750
LAURA: I don't know.

4619
03:12:12.750 --> 03:12:15.710
Maybe the crest was the key.
TALIESIN: The key to a tomb.

4620
03:12:17.729 --> 03:12:22.410
MARISHA: Maybe there's another far, not in the city.

4621
03:12:22.410 --> 03:12:24.060
LIAM: We are grasping at straws.

4622
03:12:24.060 --> 03:12:26.910
We have no idea where this person is.

4623
03:12:26.910 --> 03:12:27.840
TALIESIN: There's got to be somewhere.

4624
03:12:27.840 --> 03:12:30.770
LAURA: I tried scrying on him today, you guys.

4625
03:12:30.770 --> 03:12:32.900
SAM: Can anyone else do that?
LAURA: No.

4626
03:12:32.900 --> 03:12:34.080
TALIESIN: I can do Locate Creature,

4627
03:12:34.080 --> 03:12:36.631
but it only works if he's within a certain range.

4628
03:12:36.631 --> 03:12:38.040
MARISHA: How big is the range?

4629
03:12:38.040 --> 03:12:39.530
LAURA: You can only scry once a day.

4630
03:12:39.530 --> 03:12:42.510
LIAM: What about Caduceus?
TALIESIN: A thousand feet.

4631
03:12:43.870 --> 03:12:48.388
LIAM: You ask her questions sometimes.

4632
03:12:48.388 --> 03:12:52.332
TALIESIN: That's a thing I can't do right now.

4633
03:12:52.332 --> 03:12:53.508
LIAM: Oh.

4634
03:12:54.608 --> 03:12:57.750
Do you have a feeling?

4635
03:12:58.597 --> 03:13:01.010
LAURA: I have a lot of feelings.

4636
03:13:02.551 --> 03:13:04.630
LIAM: But Caduceus, do you have a feeling?

4637
03:13:04.630 --> 03:13:09.630
TALIESIN: I mean, my feeling is that if there's a big door

4638
03:13:10.790 --> 03:13:13.770
with a lot of options, if you're presented

4639
03:13:13.770 --> 03:13:16.885
with a bunch of options and none of them are appetizing,

4640
03:13:16.885 --> 03:13:18.820
you go get a meal somewhere else.

4641
03:13:19.668 --> 03:13:22.290
LAURA: That's what my feelings were, too,

4642
03:13:22.290 --> 03:13:25.840
but mostly I was thinking specifically about food.

4643
03:13:26.969 --> 03:13:28.800
TALIESIN: I'm thinking that maybe there's someone

4644
03:13:28.800 --> 03:13:30.890
in town that knows something about this place.

4645
03:13:30.890 --> 03:13:34.424
Maybe we should, I don't know, talk to somebody

4646
03:13:34.424 --> 03:13:37.730
who actually has a better sense of--

4647
03:13:37.730 --> 03:13:39.271
TRAVIS: Somebody who's seen Obann?

4648
03:13:39.271 --> 03:13:40.107
LIAM: Knows him.

4649
03:13:40.107 --> 03:13:42.550
TALIESIN: Or knows enough about this tower

4650
03:13:42.550 --> 03:13:44.370
to have an opinion about--

4651
03:13:44.370 --> 03:13:47.650
LIAM: He could be in a different location

4652
03:13:47.650 --> 03:13:50.618
entirely than where we are.
LAURA: I should message him?

4653
03:13:50.618 --> 03:13:52.282
SAM: Back up, back up.

4654
03:13:52.282 --> 03:13:54.560
What information do we know?

4655
03:13:54.560 --> 03:13:56.810
He was going to Bazzoxan.

4656
03:13:56.810 --> 03:13:58.446
He mentioned the tomb--
LAURA: He didn't say.

4657
03:13:58.446 --> 03:14:01.496
He didn't say Bazzoxan to me.

4658
03:14:01.496 --> 03:14:03.780
He said come north.

4659
03:14:03.780 --> 03:14:04.800
Bring her.

4660
03:14:06.600 --> 03:14:09.190
MATT: Bazzoxan you overheard

4661
03:14:09.190 --> 03:14:11.950
when the deal was going on in the Overcrow.

4662
03:14:11.950 --> 03:14:13.900
SAM: Did you overhear him say something about a crest?

4663
03:14:13.900 --> 03:14:16.664
Something about Talonstadt?

4664
03:14:16.664 --> 03:14:17.497
Was that him?

4665
03:14:17.497 --> 03:14:18.330
Was that from him?

4666
03:14:18.330 --> 03:14:20.840
MATT: No, that was the--
ASHLEY: Hobgoblin.

4667
03:14:20.840 --> 03:14:24.110
MATT: Or the dragonborn that was delivering it

4668
03:14:24.110 --> 03:14:25.250
travels to and from Talonstadt,

4669
03:14:25.250 --> 03:14:27.260
and then delivered it.
SAM: Okay.

4670
03:14:27.260 --> 03:14:29.010
LIAM: He's curious about Yasha.

4671
03:14:29.010 --> 03:14:29.843
LAURA: Yes, yes.

4672
03:14:29.843 --> 03:14:33.808
MARISHA: He mentioned following the Angel of Irons.

4673
03:14:33.808 --> 03:14:38.589
LAURA: That was the dead hobgoblin that said that.

4674
03:14:39.681 --> 03:14:44.231
LIAM: Maybe, then, using you as bait is our best option.

4675
03:14:44.231 --> 03:14:45.065
ASHLEY: That's not a bad idea.

4676
03:14:45.065 --> 03:14:47.030
LAURA: I can message him and say hey, man.

4677
03:14:47.030 --> 03:14:47.863
I brought her.

4678
03:14:47.863 --> 03:14:48.696
Where are you?

4679
03:14:48.696 --> 03:14:51.110
SAM: We've got the Orphan Maker.

4680
03:14:51.110 --> 03:14:54.248
LIAM: We've arrived in Bazzoxan with the Orphan Maker.

4681
03:14:54.248 --> 03:14:57.098
MARISHA: Did we know anything else about the Angel of Irons?

4682
03:14:58.020 --> 03:14:59.640
MATT: You can make a religion check.

4683
03:14:59.640 --> 03:15:02.405
LAURA: I think we tried to make it before.

4684
03:15:02.405 --> 03:15:04.097
TRAVIS: Yeah, but it's been a whole bunch of another days.

4685
03:15:05.567 --> 03:15:07.612
MATT: You did try and make it before.

4686
03:15:07.612 --> 03:15:10.446
I'll say allow you once with disadvantage.

4687
03:15:10.446 --> 03:15:13.357
LIAM: I've never even heard of Angel of Irons.

4688
03:15:13.357 --> 03:15:14.680
MARISHA: That was pretty good.

4689
03:15:14.680 --> 03:15:16.236
LIAM: Until just now.

4690
03:15:16.236 --> 03:15:18.077
MARISHA: Ooh! Yes!

4691
03:15:19.156 --> 03:15:20.322
LIAM: Not an official one.

4692
03:15:21.737 --> 03:15:24.597
MARISHA: It's 17 plus, 23.
MATT: 23?

4693
03:15:24.597 --> 03:15:26.063
MATT: Doesn't ring a bell.
MARISHA: Fuck!

4694
03:15:27.610 --> 03:15:28.443
SAM: Well, let's try it.

4695
03:15:28.443 --> 03:15:30.140
It's all we've got.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4696
03:15:30.140 --> 03:15:31.600
LAURA: Okay, what should I say?

4697
03:15:31.600 --> 03:15:34.030
I've got a limited amount of words.

4698
03:15:34.030 --> 03:15:34.980
LIAM: Yes, yes, yes, yes.

4699
03:15:34.980 --> 03:15:36.050
Let's talk this out please.

4700
03:15:36.050 --> 03:15:37.830
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to write it down.

4701
03:15:37.830 --> 03:15:38.830
Tell me what to say.

4702
03:15:40.530 --> 03:15:41.980
SAM: Don't even introduce yourself.

4703
03:15:41.980 --> 03:15:42.813
LAURA: Don't even introduce-- no.

4704
03:15:42.813 --> 03:15:43.646
I'm not going to say--

4705
03:15:43.646 --> 03:15:45.925
TRAVIS: The Orphan Maker has come.

4706
03:15:45.925 --> 03:15:49.360
SAM: To Bazzoxan.
LAURA: Has arrived!

4707
03:15:49.360 --> 03:15:50.770
SAM: Or should we be more specific?

4708
03:15:50.770 --> 03:15:51.603
TRAVIS: Naw, you got to be vague.

4709
03:15:51.603 --> 03:15:52.436
MARISHA: She has arrived,

4710
03:15:52.436 --> 03:15:54.460
because we want him to give us information.

4711
03:15:54.460 --> 03:15:55.293
LIAM: Yeah.

4712
03:15:55.293 --> 03:15:58.929
MARISHA: We want to trick him into finding out--

4713
03:15:58.929 --> 03:16:03.660
LIAM: Where can we find you?
LAURA: Where are you?

4714
03:16:03.660 --> 03:16:06.000
LIAM: Where can we bring her to you?

4715
03:16:06.000 --> 03:16:08.420
LAURA: Where can we bring her to you?

4716
03:16:08.420 --> 03:16:10.240
That's a stupid sentence.

4717
03:16:10.240 --> 03:16:12.390
Where...?
SAM: Where can we find you?

4718
03:16:12.390 --> 03:16:14.420
LAURA: Where can we find you?

4719
03:16:16.500 --> 03:16:19.410
LIAM: That works, too.
TRAVIS: You can't run forever.

4720
03:16:19.410 --> 03:16:21.220
LAURA: You can't run!

4721
03:16:21.220 --> 03:16:25.120
LIAM: That seems like it might antagonize.

4722
03:16:25.120 --> 03:16:26.880
TRAVIS: Your mother would be disappointed.

4723
03:16:26.880 --> 03:16:28.480
LAURA: Your mother.

4724
03:16:28.480 --> 03:16:29.680
LIAM: Don't write down everything

4725
03:16:29.680 --> 03:16:31.345
that everyone says, please, Jester.

4726
03:16:31.345 --> 03:16:32.178
MATT: (laughs)

4727
03:16:32.178 --> 03:16:35.350
SAM: Have you seen a lost flask?

4728
03:16:35.350 --> 03:16:37.151
TRAVIS: Also maybe not so important.

4729
03:16:37.151 --> 03:16:38.760
LAURA: I can't, wow.

4730
03:16:39.826 --> 03:16:44.823
MARISHA: Maybe the Orphan Maker has arrived in the north.

4731
03:16:46.030 --> 03:16:47.980
SAM: I feel like we should be more specific.

4732
03:16:47.980 --> 03:16:49.920
No?
TRAVIS: No, no, no.

4733
03:16:49.920 --> 03:16:51.720
Got to keep a position of power.

4734
03:16:51.720 --> 03:16:53.278
ASHLEY: Then maybe just like, hey, we are here

4735
03:16:53.278 --> 03:16:57.155
in Bazzoxan and we brought the Orphan Maker.

4736
03:16:57.155 --> 03:17:01.616
TALIESIN: Not that I like any of this, that's--

4737
03:17:01.616 --> 03:17:02.480
LAURA: This is pretty good.

4738
03:17:02.480 --> 03:17:03.510
TALIESIN: That's as good as it's going to get.

4739
03:17:03.510 --> 03:17:05.330
ASHLEY: I think it's good enough.

4740
03:17:05.330 --> 03:17:07.151
SAM: We could ask about the flask.

4741
03:17:07.151 --> 03:17:11.056
LAURA: What if I'm like, hey, what was that crest doing?

4742
03:17:11.056 --> 03:17:13.020
We can watch you!

4743
03:17:13.020 --> 03:17:15.100
We're always watching you!

4744
03:17:15.100 --> 03:17:16.092
Stuff like that.

4745
03:17:17.859 --> 03:17:18.910
SAM: We're watching you is good,

4746
03:17:18.910 --> 03:17:20.530
but I don't know about asking about--

4747
03:17:20.530 --> 03:17:21.363
LAURA: Yeah, we're watching you.

4748
03:17:21.363 --> 03:17:22.196
TRAVIS: She comes alone.

4749
03:17:23.085 --> 03:17:25.262
LAURA: She comes alone.

4750
03:17:25.262 --> 03:17:28.103
But she comes more with another person.

4751
03:17:28.103 --> 03:17:30.887
(laughter)

4752
03:17:30.887 --> 03:17:31.890
MARISHA: Truer words.

4753
03:17:33.783 --> 03:17:35.346
SAM: It's different.
LIAM: Is it though?

4754
03:17:35.346 --> 03:17:37.487
SAM: It's just different. It's still good.

4755
03:17:37.487 --> 03:17:38.320
It's just different.

4756
03:17:38.320 --> 03:17:41.969
TRAVIS: Fucking-- wife, mother of my son.

4757
03:17:41.969 --> 03:17:43.298
(laughter)

4758
03:17:43.298 --> 03:17:44.560
LIAM: Nobody does it like yourself.

4759
03:17:45.990 --> 03:17:47.130
SAM: She can't have come alone,

4760
03:17:47.130 --> 03:17:48.980
because you're sending the message.

4761
03:17:48.980 --> 03:17:51.970
LAURA: This is true. That doesn't make any sense.

4762
03:17:54.160 --> 03:17:55.120
ASHLEY: He's going to know if--

4763
03:17:55.120 --> 03:17:58.120
LIAM: Do we need to bust out the above the word max,

4764
03:17:58.120 --> 03:17:59.290
or can we just be--
LAURA: No.

4765
03:17:59.290 --> 03:18:01.177
It can just be simple this time.

4766
03:18:01.177 --> 03:18:03.031
What if I just go like,

SAM: Don't start with that.

4770
03:18:08.444 --> 03:18:11.477
LIAM: Caleb is legitimately laughing at the moment.

4771
03:18:12.380 --> 03:18:13.580
LAURA: I'll end with that.

4772
03:18:13.580 --> 03:18:14.600
LIAM: What do you mean, though?

4773
03:18:14.600 --> 03:18:16.295
LAURA: Okay, okay, I'm going to start.

4774
03:18:17.311 --> 03:18:18.350
TALIESIN: Oh, man.

4775
03:18:18.350 --> 03:18:21.400
MATT: You cast the spell, reaching out into the ether,

4776
03:18:21.400 --> 03:18:23.080
sending your thoughts and words forward.

4777
03:18:23.080 --> 03:18:23.913
You say?

4778
03:18:25.314 --> 03:18:28.040
LAURA: The Orphan Maker has arrived.

03:19:07.099 --> 03:19:09.766
(laughter)

4793
03:19:11.394 --> 03:19:12.227
TALIESIN: I'm on hold.

4794
03:19:13.583 --> 03:19:16.666
♪ Do, do, do, do, do ♪

4795
03:19:18.441 --> 03:19:19.570
LIAM: Here we go.

4796
03:19:19.570 --> 03:19:21.320
Let a man formulate his thoughts.

4797
03:19:22.853 --> 03:19:23.958
TRAVIS: Oh, my god.

4798
03:19:26.870 --> 03:19:31.390
MATT: "Expedient and trustworthy.

4799
03:19:32.600 --> 03:19:34.191
"I am impressed.

4800
03:19:35.640 --> 03:19:36.998
"And a performer.

4801
03:19:39.054 --> 03:19:39.887
"Come.

4802
03:19:41.703 --> 03:19:45.686
"Five, six miles west of the village.

4803
03:19:48.590 --> 03:19:51.983
"Look for the hidden entrance.

4804
03:19:54.160 --> 03:19:55.285
"I'm waiting."

4805
03:19:57.739 --> 03:19:58.572
LAURA: Ooh.

4806
03:19:59.822 --> 03:20:02.678
Number one, he said he was impressed with me,

4807
03:20:02.678 --> 03:20:04.130
so that's really cool.

4808
03:20:04.130 --> 03:20:06.520
But he also said five or six miles west

4809
03:20:06.520 --> 03:20:08.140
of here, look for the hidden entrance.

4810
03:20:08.140 --> 03:20:09.500
SAM: We have a location!

4811
03:20:09.500 --> 03:20:10.460
That was brilliant.

4812
03:20:10.460 --> 03:20:12.170
That was a great idea.
TRAVIS: Hold on.

4813
03:20:12.170 --> 03:20:13.270
SAM: Yasha, was that yours?

4814
03:20:13.270 --> 03:20:15.260
TRAVIS: Before we get real excited,

4815
03:20:15.260 --> 03:20:16.710
did he give any description

4816
03:20:16.710 --> 03:20:21.279
of what the hidden entrance might look like?

4817
03:20:21.279 --> 03:20:23.105
TALIESIN: It'll be the one that'll be hidden.

4818
03:20:23.105 --> 03:20:24.046
MARISHA: Yeah.

4819
03:20:24.046 --> 03:20:25.352
LAURA: We can find it.

4820
03:20:25.352 --> 03:20:26.670
SAM: We know he's near mountains.

4821
03:20:26.670 --> 03:20:28.260
We know he's five to six miles away.

4822
03:20:28.260 --> 03:20:30.073
We know he's west.

4823
03:20:30.073 --> 03:20:31.030
LAURA: As we go away we can start casting--

4824
03:20:31.030 --> 03:20:32.220
TALIESIN: I can't believe I'm saying this,

4825
03:20:32.220 --> 03:20:33.640
but this feels like a plan.

4826
03:20:33.640 --> 03:20:35.350
LAURA: --Locate Creature, Locate Object.

4827
03:20:35.350 --> 03:20:37.555
I mean, we can find him.

4828
03:20:37.555 --> 03:20:38.940
TRAVIS: We should definitely go into the tunnels

4829
03:20:38.940 --> 03:20:41.954
and check out the Abyss before we go though, right?

4830
03:20:41.954 --> 03:20:42.787
LIAM: No.

4831
03:20:42.787 --> 03:20:44.320
No, Fjord, we should not do that.

4832
03:20:44.320 --> 03:20:46.950
TALIESIN: I'll tell you what, on the way out.

4833
03:20:48.564 --> 03:20:49.397
Like a shop.

4834
03:20:49.397 --> 03:20:50.230
We'll hit the shop.

4835
03:20:50.230 --> 03:20:52.617
You hit the gift store on the way out.

4836
03:20:52.617 --> 03:20:53.650
MARISHA: Anyone else find it ironic?

4837
03:20:53.650 --> 03:20:54.650
TRAVIS: Just one tunnel?

4838
03:20:54.650 --> 03:20:56.400
LAURA: What?
TRAVIS: Maybe just one tunnel?

4839
03:20:56.400 --> 03:20:57.333
TALIESIN: You want one abyssal?

4840
03:20:57.333 --> 03:20:58.916
LAURA: Don't you think--

4841
03:20:58.916 --> 03:21:00.250
MARISHA: ♪ Don't you think ♪

4842
03:21:00.250 --> 03:21:02.380
All the realms that have been ripped open

4843
03:21:02.380 --> 03:21:04.888
have been from the Abyss.
LAURA: Yeah.

4844
03:21:04.888 --> 03:21:06.688
TRAVIS: ♪ It's like rain ♪

4845
03:21:06.688 --> 03:21:07.521
TALIESIN: I was waiting for it.

4846
03:21:07.521 --> 03:21:11.062
SAM: And we're right here next to a gate to the Abyss?

4847
03:21:12.462 --> 03:21:14.630
TALIESIN: Just saw Matt check one thing for that joke.

4848
03:21:14.630 --> 03:21:15.960
SAM: Have these all been abyssal rifts?

4849
03:21:15.960 --> 03:21:16.793
LAURA: Yes.

4850
03:21:16.793 --> 03:21:17.910
SAM: They've all been abyssal rifts?

4851
03:21:17.910 --> 03:21:19.803
LIAM: Yeah, they have. Yes.

4852
03:21:19.803 --> 03:21:21.941
SAM: So this fellow is creating them.

4853
03:21:21.941 --> 03:21:23.440
LAURA: Yeah, I think so.

4854
03:21:23.440 --> 03:21:24.490
MARISHA: We have a pretty strong idea.

4855
03:21:24.490 --> 03:21:26.586
SAM: Upon payment from the Empire.

4856
03:21:26.586 --> 03:21:27.570
LAURA: Maybe.
TALIESIN: Quite possibly.

4857
03:21:27.570 --> 03:21:30.130
ASHLEY: Maybe he's trying to open the Tomb.

4858
03:21:30.130 --> 03:21:31.030
TALIESIN: To let loose a bunch of them.

4859
03:21:31.030 --> 03:21:31.863
LAURA: Oh, my god!

4860
03:21:31.863 --> 03:21:35.681
What if he's trying to bring a demonic prince here?

4861
03:21:35.681 --> 03:21:38.910
LIAM: Also, we are going five to six miles

4862
03:21:38.910 --> 03:21:41.018
to the west. Do we have a plan?

4863
03:21:42.010 --> 03:21:43.776
SAM: Let's go.

4864
03:21:43.776 --> 03:21:46.487
LIAM: Do we have a plan besides "let's go"?

4865
03:21:46.487 --> 03:21:47.438
SAM: Do we ever?

4866
03:21:47.438 --> 03:21:49.923
LIAM: Yeah. Yes, we do. Yeah.

4867
03:21:49.923 --> 03:21:52.337
ASHLEY: Which way is west, Matt?

4868
03:21:52.337 --> 03:21:53.670
MATT: West would be this way.

4869
03:21:53.670 --> 03:21:56.913
You'd be traveling this way along the mountain range.

4870
03:21:59.990 --> 03:22:01.420
TRAVIS: If we don't, I think we know

4871
03:22:01.420 --> 03:22:03.290
that we're going to be keeping an eye out

4872
03:22:03.290 --> 03:22:05.780
for the same sort of baddies in the open area.

4873
03:22:05.780 --> 03:22:06.770
TALIESIN: He knows we're coming.

4874
03:22:06.770 --> 03:22:09.269
TRAVIS: Eye on the ridge for ambush.

4875
03:22:09.269 --> 03:22:13.935
And other than that, we're walking right into it.

4876
03:22:13.935 --> 03:22:15.593
LIAM: Yeah.

4877
03:22:15.593 --> 03:22:17.950
I don't know if it's a help, but I can make all of us look

4878
03:22:19.370 --> 03:22:20.890
like anything, like anyone.

4879
03:22:20.890 --> 03:22:24.033
Maybe if we broke into smaller groups and stagger?

4880
03:22:24.033 --> 03:22:24.930
No.

4881
03:22:24.930 --> 03:22:27.420
TALIESIN: I mean, it's not going to be, I don't imagine,

4882
03:22:27.420 --> 03:22:29.430
it's the sort of place that random people walk through.

4883
03:22:29.430 --> 03:22:30.370
LIAM: No, you are right.

4884
03:22:30.370 --> 03:22:32.100
LAURA: What is it, Yasha?

4885
03:22:32.100 --> 03:22:33.491
ASHLEY: No, I just...

4886
03:22:34.590 --> 03:22:37.590
If we get close to there, I could just

4887
03:22:40.574 --> 03:22:42.660
go in alone or something,

4888
03:22:42.660 --> 03:22:44.780
act like it's just me,

4889
03:22:44.780 --> 03:22:48.720
and then you guys could (sighs)

4890
03:22:48.720 --> 03:22:51.600
be hidden somewhere in case something goes awry.

4891
03:22:52.631 --> 03:22:55.298
(uncertain groans)

4892
03:22:57.326 --> 03:22:58.159
TALIESIN: We already know--

4893
03:22:58.159 --> 03:23:00.260
LAURA: What if you go and then they put you in chains

4894
03:23:00.260 --> 03:23:02.070
or something and then we don't know,

4895
03:23:02.070 --> 03:23:03.440
and we can't get to you in time,

4896
03:23:03.440 --> 03:23:04.870
and then they take you to a rift

4897
03:23:04.870 --> 03:23:06.680
and then you're in the Abyss.

4898
03:23:06.680 --> 03:23:08.180
There could be so many things.

4899
03:23:10.976 --> 03:23:11.809
ASHLEY: Yeah.

4900
03:23:11.809 --> 03:23:13.629
TALIESIN: Safety in numbers.

4901
03:23:13.629 --> 03:23:16.037
MARISHA: What if in your past life, before you lost your

4902
03:23:16.037 --> 03:23:19.560
memory, you were an Iron Angel!

4903
03:23:19.560 --> 03:23:21.788
Were an Angel of Iron.
LAURA: Oh, my god!

4904
03:23:21.788 --> 03:23:24.880
MARISHA: You were the Queen of the Angel of Irons,

4905
03:23:24.880 --> 03:23:27.902
and they're like, welcome home, mother.

4906
03:23:27.902 --> 03:23:30.735
It could actually be super badass.

4907
03:23:31.770 --> 03:23:35.748
LIAM: Super fun, but it seems like an outside chance.

4908
03:23:35.748 --> 03:23:37.085
ASHLEY: It feels like a--

4909
03:23:37.085 --> 03:23:38.990
TALIESIN: One doesn't know how to prepare for that, really.

4910
03:23:38.990 --> 03:23:40.300
ASHLEY: I don't think I'm--
TALIESIN: Don't know what you'd pack.

4911
03:23:40.300 --> 03:23:42.290
MARISHA: She's got dope wings, though.

4912
03:23:42.290 --> 03:23:44.390
ASHLEY: Yeah, but I don't think that makes me...

4913
03:23:45.630 --> 03:23:47.500
That makes me a freak, not an angel.

4914
03:23:47.500 --> 03:23:48.610
LIAM: What did you say?

4915
03:23:48.610 --> 03:23:50.382
Did you say that she's going alone?

4916
03:23:50.382 --> 03:23:52.550
LAURA: No, I just said she's arrived.

4917
03:23:52.550 --> 03:23:53.934
Where can we meet you?

4918
03:23:53.934 --> 03:23:58.390
He sounds like he's placating us,

4919
03:23:58.390 --> 03:24:01.860
but he also sounds like we may be able to talk to him.

4920
03:24:01.860 --> 03:24:03.420
TRAVIS: Let's do it.

4921
03:24:03.420 --> 03:24:04.640
What else are we going to do?

4922
03:24:04.640 --> 03:24:06.170
TALIESIN: I mean, we're here.

4923
03:24:06.170 --> 03:24:07.736
LAURA: He obviously thinks we are

4924
03:24:07.736 --> 03:24:10.077
not very powerful, because--

4925
03:24:10.077 --> 03:24:11.914
ASHLEY: But he also did run from us.

4926
03:24:11.914 --> 03:24:13.600
TRAVIS: He did.

4927
03:24:13.600 --> 03:24:16.557
LAURA: Maybe he had important shit to do.

4928
03:24:16.557 --> 03:24:17.390
TRAVIS: Come on.

4929
03:24:17.390 --> 03:24:18.680
Let's get the moorbounders.

4930
03:24:18.680 --> 03:24:20.560
Let's do this.
LAURA: Let's do it.

4931
03:24:20.560 --> 03:24:22.300
SAM: This sounds terrible.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4932
03:24:22.300 --> 03:24:23.170
SAM: This seems like a terrible idea.

4933
03:24:23.170 --> 03:24:24.410
TRAVIS: It's this or the tunnels.

4934
03:24:24.410 --> 03:24:25.530
Either way, I'm happy.

4935
03:24:25.530 --> 03:24:26.570
Let's go.

4936
03:24:26.570 --> 03:24:28.280
LAURA: Or we can sleep one more night here

4937
03:24:28.280 --> 03:24:31.991
and just go meet him tomorrow, because he knows we're here.

4938
03:24:31.991 --> 03:24:36.991
And that way I didn't waste my fifth level spell scrying.

4939
03:24:37.298 --> 03:24:38.140
Oh, no?

4940
03:24:38.140 --> 03:24:40.060
You guys, what you think?
(laughter)

4941
03:24:40.060 --> 03:24:41.430
TALIESIN: Why did you use your fifth?

4942
03:24:41.430 --> 03:24:42.263
Well, okay.

4943
03:24:43.985 --> 03:24:46.010
TRAVIS: All in favor of saddling up.

4944
03:24:49.860 --> 03:24:51.866
ASHLEY: Yeah, let's do it.

4945
03:24:51.866 --> 03:24:53.224
MATT: All right.

4946
03:24:53.224 --> 03:24:54.870
You gather your moorbounders

4947
03:24:54.870 --> 03:24:56.840
from the outside of the barracks,

4948
03:24:58.190 --> 03:24:59.950
take your cloth and cover your faces

4949
03:24:59.950 --> 03:25:03.640
as the dust storms kick up heavier and heavier westward

4950
03:25:03.640 --> 03:25:04.580
in the direction you're traveling,

4951
03:25:04.580 --> 03:25:06.670
so at least you're not going against it.

4952
03:25:06.670 --> 03:25:10.270
As your moorbounders take off and continue to push forward.

4953
03:25:10.270 --> 03:25:12.020
TALIESIN: Actually, that's a question before we took off.

4954
03:25:12.020 --> 03:25:16.280
Do they sell goggles here or something like that?

4955
03:25:16.280 --> 03:25:20.012
MATT: There are face masking and goggle wear if you want to.

4956
03:25:20.012 --> 03:25:21.469
This is not an uncommon thing

4957
03:25:21.469 --> 03:25:22.302
this side of the Barbed Fields.

4958
03:25:22.302 --> 03:25:23.700
TALIESIN: It might not be a bad idea if we're going

4959
03:25:23.700 --> 03:25:25.407
out in the middle--
LAURA: Yeah!

4960
03:25:26.632 --> 03:25:30.103
TRAVIS: We all gear up.
MATT: Okay, all right.

4961
03:25:30.103 --> 03:25:31.220
That'd be six pairs of goggles,

4962
03:25:31.220 --> 03:25:33.931
since you have your own, necessarily.

4963
03:25:33.931 --> 03:25:36.940
That'll run you one gold, five silver for the whole batch.

4964
03:25:36.940 --> 03:25:38.195
LAURA: Yes!
TALIESIN: Premium price, cool.

4965
03:25:38.195 --> 03:25:39.028
LAURA: Sweet.

4966
03:25:39.028 --> 03:25:42.350
ASHLEY: I'll put in, since this is--

4967
03:25:42.350 --> 03:25:43.508
MATT: All right.

4968
03:25:43.508 --> 03:25:44.419
MARISHA: These have jewels on them.

4969
03:25:44.419 --> 03:25:47.925
LAURA: (laughs) Why do mine have spikes along the side?

4970
03:25:47.925 --> 03:25:50.810
SAM: Before we go in, I try to buy a bottle of booze.

4971
03:25:52.030 --> 03:25:53.670
MATT: Okay.

4972
03:25:53.670 --> 03:25:57.458
You go ahead and head back to The Ready Room.

4973
03:25:59.596 --> 03:26:00.610
"Can I help you with anything?"

4974
03:26:00.610 --> 03:26:02.040
SAM: Just need to buy a bottle of--

4975
03:26:02.040 --> 03:26:02.873
TRAVIS: She's underage.

4976
03:26:02.873 --> 03:26:04.116
Don't sell to her.

4977
03:26:04.116 --> 03:26:07.010
SAM: Any alcohol that you might have?

4978
03:26:08.683 --> 03:26:10.000
MATT: He starts looking at the both of you.

4979
03:26:10.000 --> 03:26:12.900
Both of you make persuasion checks. (laughs)

4980
03:26:14.168 --> 03:26:15.670
SAM: It's you, Fjord.
LAURA: Oh!

4981
03:26:15.670 --> 03:26:17.082
SAM: It's you.

4982
03:26:17.082 --> 03:26:18.998
Natural one.

4983
03:26:18.998 --> 03:26:21.314
MATT: (laughs)

4984
03:26:21.314 --> 03:26:24.033
TRAVIS: Better than that.
SAM: Minus three.

4985
03:26:24.033 --> 03:26:26.981
(laughter)

4986
03:26:26.981 --> 03:26:28.550
Oh, no. It's plus one weirdly.

4987
03:26:28.550 --> 03:26:29.918
LAURA: Oh, so one!
SAM: It changed.

4988
03:26:29.918 --> 03:26:32.655
MATT: "We are unfortunately out."

4989
03:26:34.437 --> 03:26:35.270
SAM: What?

4990
03:26:36.270 --> 03:26:37.650
Oh.

4991
03:26:38.770 --> 03:26:41.480
TRAVIS: She likes to buy booze for me.

4992
03:26:41.480 --> 03:26:45.055
I'll take a bottle.
MATT: "25 gold."

4993
03:26:46.038 --> 03:26:47.180
LAURA: Oh!

4994
03:26:47.180 --> 03:26:49.827
TRAVIS: 25 gold?

4995
03:26:49.827 --> 03:26:52.410
Mm.
ALL: Mm.

4996
03:26:54.026 --> 03:26:56.335
LAURA: (noise of dissent)
TRAVIS: Yeah, no problem.

4997
03:26:56.335 --> 03:26:58.468
LAURA: (scoffs)

4998
03:26:58.468 --> 03:26:59.880
MATT: There you go, bottle of booze.

4999
03:27:02.122 --> 03:27:05.460
TRAVIS: I pop the cork. (sniffs)

5000
03:27:06.610 --> 03:27:07.770
Does it smell like booze?

5001
03:27:07.770 --> 03:27:09.373
MATT: It smells like some of the strongest

5002
03:27:09.373 --> 03:27:10.785
hooch you've ever smelled.

5003
03:27:10.785 --> 03:27:13.235
TRAVIS: Okay, making sure it wasn't water or some shit.

5004
03:27:14.705 --> 03:27:16.450
All right, thank you.

5005
03:27:16.450 --> 03:27:18.200
SAM: Hand it over.
TRAVIS: What?

5006
03:27:18.200 --> 03:27:19.860
SAM: Hand it over.
TRAVIS: Hand what over?

5007
03:27:19.860 --> 03:27:22.290
SAM: The thing that's in your hand.

5008
03:27:22.290 --> 03:27:23.700
TRAVIS: This is for disinfecting.

5009
03:27:23.700 --> 03:27:24.640
What do you want?

5010
03:27:24.640 --> 03:27:26.210
SAM: I need...
TRAVIS: Huh?

5011
03:27:27.110 --> 03:27:27.943
Come on.

5012
03:27:27.943 --> 03:27:28.776
Let's get out there.

5013
03:27:28.776 --> 03:27:29.663
Time to ride, hi-yah!

5014
03:27:29.663 --> 03:27:32.330
(laughter)

5015
03:27:34.480 --> 03:27:37.150
MATT: Mounting your moorbounders, googles on,

5016
03:27:37.150 --> 03:27:39.093
cloth wraps over the front of the face,

5017
03:27:39.093 --> 03:27:41.760
you all exit through the western side of Bazzoxan,

5018
03:27:41.760 --> 03:27:45.574
along with the wind and the clusters of dust that follow,

5019
03:27:45.574 --> 03:27:48.700
moving past you at a speed that's just beyond the pace

5020
03:27:48.700 --> 03:27:51.180
of your moorbounders, so the wind and the clouds

5021
03:27:51.180 --> 03:27:53.824
are slowly shifting past you from behind.

5022
03:27:53.824 --> 03:27:56.320
Using that, keeping your eye forward,

5023
03:27:56.320 --> 03:27:58.400
you make your way westward,

5024
03:27:58.400 --> 03:28:02.020
one mile, two miles.

5025
03:28:02.020 --> 03:28:03.640
Everybody make a stealth check.

5026
03:28:03.640 --> 03:28:04.760
I'll say with advantage

5027
03:28:04.760 --> 03:28:07.820
because you are amongst the dust clouds.

5028
03:28:09.353 --> 03:28:10.864
LIAM: Come on, O'Brien.

5029
03:28:10.864 --> 03:28:13.369
TALIESIN: Ooh!
MARISHA: With advantage?

5030
03:28:13.369 --> 03:28:14.950
MATT: Mm-hmm.

5031
03:28:14.950 --> 03:28:16.680
TRAVIS: Eight.
MARISHA: 27.

5032
03:28:16.680 --> 03:28:18.870
LAURA: Oh, I am going to give blessing to Caduceus?

5033
03:28:18.870 --> 03:28:20.053
TALIESIN: No, I'm good.

5034
03:28:20.053 --> 03:28:21.210
LAURA: Well, I already said it.

5035
03:28:21.210 --> 03:28:23.100
MATT: Caduceus and who else?
TALIESIN: What does that do?

5036
03:28:23.100 --> 03:28:24.340
LAURA: You get advantage.

5037
03:28:24.340 --> 03:28:25.800
Oh wait, you already got advantage.

5038
03:28:25.800 --> 03:28:26.633
MATT: No, no.

5039
03:28:26.633 --> 03:28:28.178
Blessing doesn't help ability checks.

5040
03:28:28.178 --> 03:28:29.786
LAURA: Blessing of the Trickster.

5041
03:28:29.786 --> 03:28:30.619
MATT: Oh, I see.

5042
03:28:30.619 --> 03:28:31.452
TALIESIN: And we already advantage.

5043
03:28:31.452 --> 03:28:32.285
LAURA: Yeah, we already have advantage.

5044
03:28:32.285 --> 03:28:33.683
I'm dumb.
MATT: That's all right.

5045
03:28:34.750 --> 03:28:36.653
MARISHA: 27.
LIAM: 18.

5046
03:28:36.653 --> 03:28:38.609
SAM: Natural 20.
LAURA: Ooh, 20.

5047
03:28:38.609 --> 03:28:41.060
TALIESIN: 19.
MATT: Yasha?

5048
03:28:41.060 --> 03:28:44.560
ASHLEY: 19.
LAURA: Woo!

5049
03:28:44.560 --> 03:28:47.930
MATT: You feel pretty solid that nothing notices

5050
03:28:47.930 --> 03:28:50.857
your continuous push to the west.

5051
03:28:50.857 --> 03:28:53.120
Following the base of the mountain range,

5052
03:28:53.120 --> 03:28:55.534
you continue on the fourth mile.

5053
03:28:55.534 --> 03:28:59.268
You hit the five-mile section

5054
03:28:59.268 --> 03:29:01.430
and now you're looking over

5055
03:29:01.430 --> 03:29:04.120
to who's keeping point on the watch on this.

5056
03:29:04.120 --> 03:29:05.670
ASHLEY: That was Caduceus.

5057
03:29:05.670 --> 03:29:08.186
MATT: All right, so Caduceus and--

5058
03:29:08.186 --> 03:29:10.215
LAURA: I'm going to, hmm.

5059
03:29:10.215 --> 03:29:11.050
MATT: If someone wants to help Caduceus,

5060
03:29:11.050 --> 03:29:12.520
or you can make separate perception checks,

5061
03:29:12.520 --> 03:29:14.200
in this dust storm are with disadvantage.

5062
03:29:14.200 --> 03:29:15.033
TRAVIS: I'll help.

5063
03:29:15.033 --> 03:29:16.090
I'll help you.

5064
03:29:16.090 --> 03:29:16.923
Do it straight up.

5065
03:29:16.923 --> 03:29:18.240
LIAM: It's too dusty to even think

5066
03:29:18.240 --> 03:29:19.850
about looking for a hidden doorway

5067
03:29:19.850 --> 03:29:20.820
in the mountains at this point.

5068
03:29:20.820 --> 03:29:22.180
MATT: Well, that's what he's trying to do--

5069
03:29:22.180 --> 03:29:23.450
LIAM: I would like to help him.

5070
03:29:23.450 --> 03:29:25.943
MATT: Okay, so you either roll individually with

5071
03:29:25.943 --> 03:29:27.693
disadvantage or you help him

5072
03:29:27.693 --> 03:29:29.610
and he rolls just a normal roll.

5073
03:29:29.610 --> 03:29:31.076
LIAM: Perception or investigation?

5074
03:29:31.076 --> 03:29:32.000
MATT: Perception.

5075
03:29:32.000 --> 03:29:33.430
LIAM: I let him roll with advantage.

5076
03:29:33.430 --> 03:29:36.680
MATT: Okay, so a single roll for you, Caduceus,

5077
03:29:36.680 --> 03:29:37.630
to keep an eye out for something

5078
03:29:37.630 --> 03:29:38.700
that might catch your attention.

5079
03:29:38.700 --> 03:29:39.691
TALIESIN: Okay, weird question.

5080
03:29:39.691 --> 03:29:40.524
MATT: Yes?

5081
03:29:40.524 --> 03:29:42.898
TALIESIN: Would Find Traps help us in any way with this?

5082
03:29:42.898 --> 03:29:45.980
MATT: This isn't finding a trap, unfortunately.

5083
03:29:45.980 --> 03:29:46.890
TALIESIN: Okay, yeah.

5084
03:29:46.890 --> 03:29:49.120
MATT: This is spotting something that is different

5085
03:29:49.120 --> 03:29:50.170
from the rest of the rocks.

5086
03:29:50.170 --> 03:29:51.572
TALIESIN: Just a straight perception check.

5087
03:29:51.572 --> 03:29:52.570
MATT: Just straight perception check.

5088
03:29:52.570 --> 03:29:55.154
TALIESIN: Come on, come on, no whammies.

5089
03:29:55.154 --> 03:29:56.323
(groans) 13.

5090
03:29:56.323 --> 03:30:00.260
MATT: 13, you get the fifth to sixth-mile range

5091
03:30:00.260 --> 03:30:01.760
and there's too much dust

5092
03:30:01.760 --> 03:30:06.302
and nothing is catching your attention here unfortunately,

5093
03:30:06.302 --> 03:30:07.920
and you loop around.

5094
03:30:07.920 --> 03:30:11.958
LAURA: I try Locate Object and see if I can do it.

5095
03:30:11.958 --> 03:30:13.464
TALIESIN: That might do it.

5096
03:30:13.464 --> 03:30:15.700
Yeah, what's the range on that?

5097
03:30:15.700 --> 03:30:17.250
LAURA: A thousand feet.
TALIESIN: Wow.

5098
03:30:17.250 --> 03:30:20.240
Well, I could also do Locate Creature at a thousand feet.

5099
03:30:20.240 --> 03:30:21.516
You've already burned a spell.

5100
03:30:21.516 --> 03:30:24.203
I'll try Locate Creature

5101
03:30:24.203 --> 03:30:26.760
as we pass by again for another...

5102
03:30:27.830 --> 03:30:29.905
MATT: Okay, so you pass by the sixth, the fifth mile.

5103
03:30:29.905 --> 03:30:33.190
At full speed, and it lasts for ten minutes, is it?

5104
03:30:33.190 --> 03:30:34.820
TALIESIN: Locate Creature is up to an hour.

5105
03:30:34.820 --> 03:30:36.150
MATT: Up to an hour, okay.

5106
03:30:36.150 --> 03:30:38.550
You cast Locate Creature.

5107
03:30:38.550 --> 03:30:40.180
You mark off that spell.

5108
03:30:40.180 --> 03:30:44.500
You move past, nothing.
TALIESIN: Nothing?

5109
03:30:44.500 --> 03:30:47.710
MATT: Back the second time, nothing.

5110
03:30:47.710 --> 03:30:49.320
About 20 minutes back and forth.

5111
03:30:50.420 --> 03:30:53.863
I envision you're casting this on Obann, right?

5112
03:30:53.863 --> 03:30:55.625
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.
MATT: Nothing.

5113
03:30:57.775 --> 03:31:01.360
TALIESIN: I keep an eye out for anything unusual.

5114
03:31:01.360 --> 03:31:02.550
LAURA: I mean, can I...

5115
03:31:02.550 --> 03:31:04.300
I don't know, it was just fucking

5116
03:31:04.300 --> 03:31:05.630
mountains when I was scrying.

5117
03:31:05.630 --> 03:31:09.108
Does anything look familiar from the time I was scrying?

5118
03:31:09.108 --> 03:31:10.757
MATT: You saw the thing that he pulled out.

5119
03:31:10.757 --> 03:31:11.590
LAURA: Well, yeah.

5120
03:31:11.590 --> 03:31:13.190
I'm talking like the mountain range.

5121
03:31:13.190 --> 03:31:14.040
MATT: Mountain range?

5122
03:31:15.550 --> 03:31:17.960
Make a perception check with disadvantage.

5123
03:31:17.960 --> 03:31:20.360
LIAM: Are we tracing the edge of the base of the mountain?

5124
03:31:20.360 --> 03:31:22.110
MATT: You guys are riding along the edge of it,

5125
03:31:22.110 --> 03:31:24.197
yeah, along the mountain range.

5126
03:31:24.197 --> 03:31:25.840
LAURA: Yeah, no, nine.

5127
03:31:25.840 --> 03:31:28.190
MATT: Unfortunately, it's daytime now.

5128
03:31:28.190 --> 03:31:29.428
There's more light than when you saw it

5129
03:31:29.428 --> 03:31:31.050
when you scryed on him.

5130
03:31:31.050 --> 03:31:34.640
The dust, everything, it's a really rough combination

5131
03:31:34.640 --> 03:31:36.490
of elements to try and recall directly.

5132
03:31:36.490 --> 03:31:38.430
LAURA: All right, I'm going to cast Locate Object

5133
03:31:38.430 --> 03:31:40.340
on the crest that he had in his hand.

5134
03:31:40.340 --> 03:31:41.320
MATT: Okay.

5135
03:31:41.320 --> 03:31:43.850
You ride on for about ten minutes

5136
03:31:43.850 --> 03:31:46.140
on and (popping).

5137
03:31:46.140 --> 03:31:47.300
SAM: Hm?

5138
03:31:47.300 --> 03:31:50.400
MATT: Your brain catches it and you draw a direction.

5139
03:31:52.200 --> 03:31:53.390
LAURA: Oop, (stutters). Ho.

5140
03:31:54.325 --> 03:31:55.550
That way!

5141
03:31:55.550 --> 03:31:56.383
MATT: Jester gives a point and

5142
03:31:56.383 --> 03:31:57.270
you guys start hanging that way.

5143
03:31:57.270 --> 03:31:58.103
TALIESIN: All right.

5144
03:31:58.103 --> 03:31:59.130
MATT: Bee lining towards up the way,

5145
03:31:59.130 --> 03:32:00.560
you can feel it shifting to the right

5146
03:32:00.560 --> 03:32:02.420
until eventually you come up to the edge

5147
03:32:02.420 --> 03:32:04.661
and the rock begins to look familiar.

5148
03:32:04.661 --> 03:32:07.191
You can glance and it brings you to a point

5149
03:32:07.191 --> 03:32:09.070
where there was a small pocket

5150
03:32:09.070 --> 03:32:10.490
that is hidden in shadow from

5151
03:32:10.490 --> 03:32:12.187
where the light's coming from above.

5152
03:32:13.070 --> 03:32:16.014
There, recessed about two inches in the side,

5153
03:32:16.014 --> 03:32:18.414
about the size of a palm,

5154
03:32:18.414 --> 03:32:21.039
is a round stone crest.

5155
03:32:21.039 --> 03:32:21.872
SAM: (gasps)

5156
03:32:23.170 --> 03:32:25.697
But he's not here, which is why your spell didn't work.

5157
03:32:25.697 --> 03:32:28.050
LIAM: It's been placed into an alcove.

5158
03:32:28.050 --> 03:32:29.400
LAURA: He could be on another plane.

5159
03:32:29.400 --> 03:32:30.250
SAM: This is the door.

5160
03:32:30.250 --> 03:32:32.610
LIAM: I want to drop down and start examining it

5161
03:32:32.610 --> 03:32:34.810
and see if I can figure out how it works.

5162
03:32:35.948 --> 03:32:37.295
MATT: Okay.

5163
03:32:37.295 --> 03:32:38.600
TALIESIN: If I were going to spring something

5164
03:32:38.600 --> 03:32:39.930
on us, it would be here.

5165
03:32:39.930 --> 03:32:42.649
MATT: Okay, so as you approach it,

5166
03:32:42.649 --> 03:32:44.680
you can glance off to the left of it

5167
03:32:44.680 --> 03:32:49.490
and you can see, about 30 feet from it,

5168
03:32:51.080 --> 03:32:55.917
a small, six-foot cave on the side of the mountain.

5169
03:32:58.420 --> 03:33:00.910
As you glance in towards the seal,

5170
03:33:02.720 --> 03:33:05.762
you can see things inscribed on it.

5171
03:33:05.762 --> 03:33:09.840
It looks like it has a carving of a simple mouth with teeth,

5172
03:33:09.840 --> 03:33:13.028
and there are runes both above and below it.

5173
03:33:13.028 --> 03:33:13.980
LIAM: Can I read them?

5174
03:33:13.980 --> 03:33:16.174
Are they arcane in nature?

5175
03:33:16.174 --> 03:33:17.538
MATT: It appears to be a language.

5176
03:33:17.538 --> 03:33:19.540
Do any of you know Celestial?

5177
03:33:19.540 --> 03:33:20.776
ASHLEY: Yes.
LIAM: Yes.

5178
03:33:20.776 --> 03:33:22.618
TRAVIS: (snaps fingers)
MARISHA: Dope!

5179
03:33:22.618 --> 03:33:26.639
MATT: Both Yasha and Caleb, looking into it,

5180
03:33:26.639 --> 03:33:28.508
make out a phrase that says,

5181
03:33:28.508 --> 03:33:31.480
let lie the king's instrument,

5182
03:33:32.330 --> 03:33:36.730
deathless and detained, until the world ends.

5183
03:33:38.390 --> 03:33:39.990
TRAVIS: One more time?

5184
03:33:39.990 --> 03:33:43.000
MATT: Let lie the king's instrument,

5185
03:33:43.000 --> 03:33:47.060
deathless and detained, until the world ends.

5186
03:33:49.943 --> 03:33:51.293
TALIESIN: It's a tomb with an exit.

5187
03:33:52.540 --> 03:33:54.100
It's the worst kind.

5188
03:33:56.379 --> 03:33:57.386
LIAM: Yeah.

5189
03:33:58.578 --> 03:34:01.140
TRAVIS: The entrance to this is just open.

5190
03:34:01.140 --> 03:34:02.820
MATT: It is currently, yes.

5191
03:34:02.820 --> 03:34:05.280
LIAM: Let lie the king's instrument, deathless and detained.

5192
03:34:05.280 --> 03:34:07.430
TRAVIS: Can I look up the ridge line?

5193
03:34:07.430 --> 03:34:08.890
SAM: That does not sound good.

5194
03:34:08.890 --> 03:34:10.954
TRAVIS: Just do a sweet of everything that's up there.

5195
03:34:10.954 --> 03:34:12.808
MATT: Perception check with disadvantage.

5196
03:34:14.141 --> 03:34:16.755
LIAM: Is there anything that can hurt us here?

5197
03:34:16.755 --> 03:34:18.830
In the walls or anything?
TRAVIS: It's not terrible.

5198
03:34:18.830 --> 03:34:20.590
SAM: You want me to go check in there?

5199
03:34:20.590 --> 03:34:21.780
LAURA: Just on the outside.
TRAVIS: 12.

5200
03:34:21.780 --> 03:34:22.640
MATT: 12?

5201
03:34:22.640 --> 03:34:24.450
LIAM: Look for anything that could harm us.

5202
03:34:24.450 --> 03:34:25.283
SAM: All right.

5203
03:34:25.283 --> 03:34:26.690
MATT: Nothing catches your eye.

5204
03:34:26.690 --> 03:34:30.750
SAM: I'm going to go check for traps around the entranceway.

5205
03:34:30.750 --> 03:34:32.066
MATT: Investigation check, please.

5206
03:34:32.066 --> 03:34:33.099
LIAM: It's an open entrance?

5207
03:34:33.099 --> 03:34:36.940
MATT: Yeah, it's just this open, yeah.

5208
03:34:36.940 --> 03:34:38.250
SAM: 15, I don't know.

5209
03:34:38.250 --> 03:34:39.083
Maybe.

5210
03:34:39.083 --> 03:34:40.801
MATT: Doesn't appear to be trapped.

5211
03:34:40.801 --> 03:34:42.995
SAM: I can't get a bead on anything.

5212
03:34:43.851 --> 03:34:44.800
I don't know.

5213
03:34:44.800 --> 03:34:45.810
Just doesn't seem right.

5214
03:34:45.810 --> 03:34:46.643
I don't know.

5215
03:34:46.643 --> 03:34:47.740
Maybe we shouldn't go in.

5216
03:34:47.740 --> 03:34:49.680
Let's just go back.

5217
03:34:49.680 --> 03:34:51.568
LIAM: Are you all right?
SAM: No.

5218
03:34:52.410 --> 03:34:56.060
LIAM: What do you need?
SAM: You know what I need.

5219
03:34:57.854 --> 03:34:59.560
But we'll be fine.

5220
03:34:59.560 --> 03:35:00.660
Anyone else want to try?

5221
03:35:01.910 --> 03:35:04.715
MARISHA: I'll look and see if I can find any signs

5222
03:35:04.715 --> 03:35:07.910
of footprints or somebody passing through.

5223
03:35:07.910 --> 03:35:09.610
MATT: Sure, make an investigation check.

5224
03:35:15.626 --> 03:35:16.890
MARISHA: (scoffs) Not good.

5225
03:35:16.890 --> 03:35:18.110
11.
MATT: 11.

5226
03:35:19.369 --> 03:35:22.520
This dust storm seems to have scooped through

5227
03:35:22.520 --> 03:35:25.826
and just covered most of any tracks that would have been.

5228
03:35:25.826 --> 03:35:28.050
If you want to look inside you can,

5229
03:35:28.050 --> 03:35:30.200
but from the outside you see no footprints.

5230
03:35:31.209 --> 03:35:33.360
LIAM: I cast...

5231
03:35:36.110 --> 03:35:36.943
No, I can't.

5232
03:35:36.943 --> 03:35:37.776
I don't have it prepared.

5233
03:35:37.776 --> 03:35:39.420
Nevermind.
TRAVIS: I don't mind.

5234
03:35:41.230 --> 03:35:42.390
SAM: You don't mind what?

5235
03:35:42.390 --> 03:35:44.250
TRAVIS: I'll walk up to the entrance.

5236
03:35:44.250 --> 03:35:45.720
MATT: Okay.

5237
03:35:45.720 --> 03:35:47.850
TRAVIS: I'll just put my hand through.

5238
03:35:49.480 --> 03:35:51.071
MATT: The temperature drops

5239
03:35:51.071 --> 03:35:53.287
based on the difference in light.

5240
03:35:54.140 --> 03:35:55.430
Nothing else.

5241
03:35:55.430 --> 03:35:58.030
TRAVIS: It's cooler in here, but my hand's still attached.

5242
03:35:59.110 --> 03:36:00.580
I'll step through.
MATT: Okay.

5243
03:36:00.580 --> 03:36:02.249
Fjord vanishes into the inside.

5244
03:36:02.249 --> 03:36:04.070
As you cross the threshold,

5245
03:36:06.780 --> 03:36:08.663
you seem fine.
SAM: Oh!

5246
03:36:11.900 --> 03:36:13.433
MATT: Stepping inside--

5247
03:36:13.433 --> 03:36:15.283
TRAVIS: That made my butt pucker.

5248
03:36:15.283 --> 03:36:17.574
(laughter)

5249
03:36:17.574 --> 03:36:20.370
MATT: It continues in, lightless,

5250
03:36:20.370 --> 03:36:23.510
this steadily descending pathway,

5251
03:36:23.510 --> 03:36:28.290
about seven-foot high, six feet wide,

5252
03:36:28.290 --> 03:36:30.880
and just continues on this slow grade

5253
03:36:30.880 --> 03:36:33.640
before vanishing beyond your periphery.

5254
03:36:33.640 --> 03:36:35.047
Just a tunnel.

5255
03:36:35.047 --> 03:36:36.983
TRAVIS: Looks like a tunnel.

5256
03:36:36.983 --> 03:36:40.250
MATT: You can see above you there is some sort

5257
03:36:40.250 --> 03:36:43.860
of a doorway that is wedged

5258
03:36:43.860 --> 03:36:46.930
in a stone slab that rolls in to close this off

5259
03:36:46.930 --> 03:36:50.270
that is part of the hiding mechanism for this entrance.

5260
03:36:50.270 --> 03:36:52.080
TALIESIN: It's probably what

5261
03:36:52.080 --> 03:36:53.680
that key is for, I imagine.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

5262
03:36:53.680 --> 03:36:55.906
Barricade looks like it's on this side.

5263
03:36:55.906 --> 03:36:56.856
You can come on in.

5264
03:36:58.051 --> 03:37:00.377
TALIESIN: What do you think about maybe we put something

5265
03:37:00.377 --> 03:37:03.510
across the door so we'll know if someone

5266
03:37:03.510 --> 03:37:05.130
is following us from behind?

5267
03:37:05.130 --> 03:37:06.830
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, a little wire.

5268
03:37:07.685 --> 03:37:09.520
LIAM: I need ten minutes.

5269
03:37:10.590 --> 03:37:11.740
MARISHA: I go inside.

5270
03:37:11.740 --> 03:37:13.320
MATT: Okay, the rest of you make it inside before.

5271
03:37:13.320 --> 03:37:15.260
It's single file in this.

5272
03:37:15.260 --> 03:37:16.590
You can uncomfortably--

5273
03:37:16.590 --> 03:37:18.020
you can go actually shoulder to shoulder,

5274
03:37:18.020 --> 03:37:20.061
like two at a time, but it's pretty tight

5275
03:37:20.061 --> 03:37:22.170
to move through any more than that.

5276
03:37:22.170 --> 03:37:23.150
MARISHA: Before too many people get in,

5277
03:37:23.150 --> 03:37:24.830
can I now do that investigation check

5278
03:37:24.830 --> 03:37:29.000
to see if I see any tracks or scrawlings on the inside.

5279
03:37:29.000 --> 03:37:30.991
TALIESIN: Any writings on the wall.

5280
03:37:30.991 --> 03:37:32.249
MARISHA: Yeah, writing on the wall.

5281
03:37:32.249 --> 03:37:33.956
TALIESIN: Anything weird.

5282
03:37:33.956 --> 03:37:34.789
MARISHA: That's better.

5283
03:37:39.490 --> 03:37:41.940
MARISHA: 19.
MATT: 19, okay.

5284
03:37:41.940 --> 03:37:43.732
You don't see any writing on the walls,

5285
03:37:43.732 --> 03:37:47.780
no runes or anything scribed on it.

5286
03:37:47.780 --> 03:37:48.920
Aside from Fjord's footsteps

5287
03:37:48.920 --> 03:37:49.890
and the other people that came in there,

5288
03:37:49.890 --> 03:37:53.919
you move beyond, and you can see no footsteps.

5289
03:37:54.769 --> 03:37:56.897
LIAM: Is it pitch dark in here?

5290
03:37:56.897 --> 03:37:57.730
MATT: It is pitch dark.

5291
03:37:57.730 --> 03:37:58.680
There is no light.

5292
03:37:58.680 --> 03:38:01.263
LAURA: Before we go inside--
LIAM: It's fine.

5293
03:38:01.263 --> 03:38:05.210
A little (bubbling sounds), two floating by my head,

5294
03:38:05.210 --> 03:38:07.030
and I left on trailing behind the group

5295
03:38:07.030 --> 03:38:09.310
and one float about ten feet in front.

5296
03:38:09.310 --> 03:38:11.690
It's dim light.
MATT: Right.

5297
03:38:11.690 --> 03:38:14.790
LAURA: I'm going to grab Yasha before we follow everyone in.

5298
03:38:15.700 --> 03:38:18.190
I'm just going to grab both your hands.

5299
03:38:18.190 --> 03:38:20.625
TALIESIN: I'll do mine, too, just to have it, of course.

5300
03:38:22.050 --> 03:38:24.190
LAURA: I don't know what we're going to find in there,

5301
03:38:24.190 --> 03:38:28.466
but this guy's obviously after you, yeah?

5302
03:38:28.466 --> 03:38:29.700
ASHLEY: Yeah.

5303
03:38:29.700 --> 03:38:32.760
LAURA: I know we were joking about it before,

5304
03:38:32.760 --> 03:38:35.632
but if anything gets too hard

5305
03:38:35.632 --> 03:38:40.270
or if you don't want to hear what he's saying,

5306
03:38:41.440 --> 03:38:44.580
just say the word and we'll all have your back.

5307
03:38:44.580 --> 03:38:45.953
ASHLEY: Okay.

5308
03:38:45.953 --> 03:38:48.703
LAURA: I don't want you to worry.

5309
03:38:48.703 --> 03:38:49.536
ASHLEY: Okay.

5310
03:38:50.590 --> 03:38:53.540
LAURA: And I know that (sighs)

5311
03:38:54.970 --> 03:38:56.250
you lost your family,

5312
03:38:59.010 --> 03:39:00.360
but we can be your new one,

5313
03:39:01.842 --> 03:39:06.143
and we love you very much, Yasha,

5314
03:39:08.712 --> 03:39:12.118
no matter what happened, okay?

5315
03:39:12.118 --> 03:39:12.951
ASHLEY: Okay.

5316
03:39:16.480 --> 03:39:17.380
Thank you, Jester.

5317
03:39:19.370 --> 03:39:21.985
LAURA: We can do this.
ASHLEY: We can do this.

5318
03:39:21.985 --> 03:39:23.079
I have an idea.

5319
03:39:23.079 --> 03:39:23.912
LAURA: (gasps)

5320
03:39:26.260 --> 03:39:28.000
ASHLEY: Calm down.

5321
03:39:28.000 --> 03:39:32.683
I think on the gate it said

5322
03:39:33.758 --> 03:39:35.649
let lie the king's instrument,

5323
03:39:35.649 --> 03:39:38.765
and I think it's a rock harp.
SAM: A what?

5324
03:39:38.765 --> 03:39:41.930
LAURA: (gasps) I think you're right.

5325
03:39:41.930 --> 03:39:43.300
ASHLEY: Yeah.

5326
03:39:43.300 --> 03:39:45.920
No, Jester was saying-- yeah, it's a joke.

5327
03:39:45.920 --> 03:39:48.996
It's not a real thing.
(laughter)

5328
03:39:48.996 --> 03:39:53.247
ASHLEY: I'm going to step to the side just privately,

5329
03:39:54.900 --> 03:39:58.147
put my hood up and try as quietly as I can.

5330
03:40:00.281 --> 03:40:01.706
(sighs)

5331
03:40:02.710 --> 03:40:05.490
Hello, Stormlord.

5332
03:40:08.724 --> 03:40:13.553
I just wanted to (sighs) say that,

5333
03:40:16.030 --> 03:40:18.070
I don't know, maybe we're doing something stupid right now,

5334
03:40:18.070 --> 03:40:19.620
but I don't know where you are,

5335
03:40:21.022 --> 03:40:23.060
but maybe you could turn your gaze

5336
03:40:23.060 --> 03:40:25.360
this way in case we need you.

5337
03:40:29.017 --> 03:40:30.894
Thank you.

5338
03:40:30.894 --> 03:40:33.190
(tense music)

5339
03:40:33.190 --> 03:40:34.023
Okay.

5340
03:40:35.790 --> 03:40:37.410
Go back to the rest of the group.

5341
03:40:37.410 --> 03:40:40.200
MATT: You step inside and get three steps into the shadows

5342
03:40:40.200 --> 03:40:44.814
before you hear (thunder rumbling)

5343
03:40:44.814 --> 03:40:49.814
distant rumble of thunder in a cloudless sky, it seems.

5344
03:40:50.258 --> 03:40:53.067
SAM: (sings ♪ Aaah ♪ from Immigrant Song by Led Zeppelin)

5345
03:40:53.067 --> 03:40:54.900
LAURA: ♪ Aaah ♪

5346
03:40:54.900 --> 03:40:57.670
LIAM: May I borrow you for three minutes, right here?

5347
03:40:57.670 --> 03:40:59.360
SAM: 30 minutes?
LIAM: Three.

5348
03:40:59.360 --> 03:41:00.837
SAM: Oh, okay.
LIAM: Yes.

5349
03:41:02.480 --> 03:41:07.480
I pull out the pearl and I cast Fortune's Favor

5350
03:41:08.210 --> 03:41:09.940
on both Yasha and myself,

5351
03:41:10.910 --> 03:41:14.350
and I also cast Gift of Alacrity on Yasha.

5352
03:41:15.780 --> 03:41:19.760
So that's basically one re-roll for you,

5353
03:41:19.760 --> 03:41:22.960
and also increased initiative.

5354
03:41:25.960 --> 03:41:26.793
ASHLEY: Amazing.

5355
03:41:30.292 --> 03:41:32.110
Thank you, Caleb.

5356
03:41:37.565 --> 03:41:38.790
I'm shaking.

5357
03:41:38.790 --> 03:41:41.048
(laughter)

5358
03:41:43.334 --> 03:41:47.637
TRAVIS: All right, we'll let the globule lead the way.

5359
03:41:50.770 --> 03:41:52.153
MATT: Continuing on.

5360
03:41:56.866 --> 03:41:57.699
A hundred feet,

5361
03:42:00.176 --> 03:42:01.400
two hundred feet.

5362
03:42:04.290 --> 03:42:08.713
You start picking up footprints, faint but recent.

5363
03:42:11.760 --> 03:42:15.190
You gather these are probably Obann's, hopefully.

5364
03:42:15.190 --> 03:42:16.915
LAURA: Mm-hm.

5365
03:42:16.915 --> 03:42:18.998
SAM: One track? One set?

5366
03:42:18.998 --> 03:42:20.200
MARISHA: Yeah, one set or multiple?

5367
03:42:20.200 --> 03:42:21.130
MATT: One set.
MARISHA: Just one?

5368
03:42:21.130 --> 03:42:21.963
Okay.

5369
03:42:23.360 --> 03:42:27.390
MATT: It continues at a slight decline one way,

5370
03:42:28.790 --> 03:42:30.810
kind of hooking to the right before straightening

5371
03:42:30.810 --> 03:42:32.280
once more and then heading almost back

5372
03:42:32.280 --> 03:42:34.600
in the direction of Bazzoxan slightly.

5373
03:42:34.600 --> 03:42:36.090
TRAVIS: Stone walls around us?

5374
03:42:36.090 --> 03:42:38.620
MATT: It's all like a smooth, carved cave.

5375
03:42:38.620 --> 03:42:41.360
It's a little rough and natural looking,

5376
03:42:41.360 --> 03:42:46.360
but it's been hollowed out to represent a hall,

5377
03:42:46.930 --> 03:42:49.522
a tunnel that would function.

5378
03:42:51.450 --> 03:42:53.745
Continuing in this path

5379
03:42:56.350 --> 03:42:58.505
for a little over a mile.

5380
03:42:58.505 --> 03:42:59.338
TRAVIS: Fuck.

5381
03:42:59.338 --> 03:43:01.272
MATT: Carefully moving forward,

5382
03:43:03.260 --> 03:43:06.400
the globes slowly drifting ahead,

5383
03:43:06.400 --> 03:43:09.303
weapons at the ready, listening for anything.

5384
03:43:09.303 --> 03:43:13.450
The tunnel just goes on and on and on,

5385
03:43:13.450 --> 03:43:15.110
and it's silence and it's darkness,

5386
03:43:15.110 --> 03:43:17.870
and the cooler interior.

5387
03:43:17.870 --> 03:43:19.300
There's that little thought in your brain

5388
03:43:19.300 --> 03:43:23.740
that creeps up that's like, how long does this go?

5389
03:43:23.740 --> 03:43:24.590
Is this infinite?

5390
03:43:26.710 --> 03:43:28.310
You push nearing the second mile

5391
03:43:29.840 --> 03:43:34.840
before the walls stop, and it just opens beyond,

5392
03:43:36.210 --> 03:43:39.260
this hallway opening into some sort of chamber

5393
03:43:39.260 --> 03:43:44.257
or variation beyond where the walls are on longer there.

5394
03:43:48.921 --> 03:43:50.662
TRAVIS: Okay, Caleb

5395
03:43:50.662 --> 03:43:53.620
LIAM: (snaps fingers) Frumpkin appears by my feet.

5396
03:43:56.820 --> 03:43:58.512
Be very quiet, please.

5397
03:44:00.750 --> 03:44:02.212
(whooshing)

5398
03:44:02.212 --> 03:44:03.045
(quiet footsteps)

5399
03:44:03.045 --> 03:44:04.020
MATT: Stealth check for Frumpkin.

5400
03:44:08.556 --> 03:44:11.377
LIAM: I want to use my Fragment of Possibility.

5401
03:44:11.377 --> 03:44:13.520
MATT: Okay.
SAM: Do you get one, too?

5402
03:44:13.520 --> 03:44:14.770
LIAM: Yeah, one for each of us.

5403
03:44:14.770 --> 03:44:15.840
Much better.
SAM: Oh, cool.

5404
03:44:15.840 --> 03:44:19.340
LIAM: That's 21.
MATT: Okay.

5405
03:44:19.340 --> 03:44:22.070
Frumpkin shifts into the chamber.

5406
03:44:22.070 --> 03:44:23.570
Perception check for Frumpkin.

5407
03:44:27.913 --> 03:44:29.670
LIAM: Shit, I don't have cat open.

5408
03:44:29.670 --> 03:44:31.320
I think it's 16.

5409
03:44:31.320 --> 03:44:32.620
MATT: Okay, I'll go with that.

5410
03:44:33.830 --> 03:44:37.160
As Frumpkin pushes in this small--

5411
03:44:37.160 --> 03:44:38.629
LIAM: 17.
MATT: Okay.

5412
03:44:38.629 --> 03:44:40.860
This small, seven-by-six-foot tunnel,

5413
03:44:40.860 --> 03:44:43.100
this domed tunnel, opens up

5414
03:44:43.100 --> 03:44:46.390
into a much larger tunnel that is cylindrical,

5415
03:44:47.470 --> 03:44:50.220
40 feet end-to-end, 40 feet top-to-bottom.

5416
03:44:51.340 --> 03:44:54.210
It just emerges into it,

5417
03:44:54.210 --> 03:44:55.610
going to the left and right.

5418
03:44:57.540 --> 03:45:01.490
SAM: Is there anything in... it's just a big hall.

5419
03:45:01.490 --> 03:45:03.060
MATT: Some tumbled rocks,

5420
03:45:03.060 --> 03:45:04.960
but it's just a long, cylindrical tunnel,

5421
03:45:04.960 --> 03:45:07.280
like a big piper tube, 40 feet by 40 feet--

5422
03:45:07.280 --> 03:45:10.008
LIAM: Are you saying a T?
MATT: Yes.

5423
03:45:10.008 --> 03:45:11.040
LIAM: Entering, and a tube going--

5424
03:45:11.040 --> 03:45:12.740
MATT: And a tube going left and right.

5425
03:45:13.800 --> 03:45:15.250
TRAVIS: Caleb, what direction have we been

5426
03:45:15.250 --> 03:45:16.990
traveling this whole time?

5427
03:45:16.990 --> 03:45:17.890
LIAM: Can't hear shit.

5428
03:45:18.990 --> 03:45:19.823
TRAVIS: Oh, right.

5429
03:45:21.500 --> 03:45:23.917
LIAM: I send...

5430
03:45:26.500 --> 03:45:28.822
I start whispering to the crew.

5431
03:45:28.822 --> 03:45:31.160
I'm at a T in the road with my cat,

5432
03:45:31.160 --> 03:45:32.750
and he can go left or right.

5433
03:45:34.769 --> 03:45:36.530
Any thoughts?

5434
03:45:36.530 --> 03:45:39.230
Tap me on the left shoulder for left, right for right.

5435
03:45:40.530 --> 03:45:41.830
LAURA: I tap him on the left.

5436
03:45:41.830 --> 03:45:45.770
TALIESIN: Which way would put us closer to the tower?

5437
03:45:47.240 --> 03:45:49.232
TRAVIS: Right.
LAURA: Oh, it would.

5438
03:45:49.232 --> 03:45:50.065
TRAVIS: That would send us back.

5439
03:45:50.065 --> 03:45:50.898
LAURA: Tap right.

5440
03:45:55.250 --> 03:45:56.540
MATT: Okay.

5441
03:45:56.540 --> 03:45:59.515
Frumpkin continues on for

5442
03:46:01.526 --> 03:46:03.842
about another 15 or so minutes,

5443
03:46:03.842 --> 03:46:06.842
the tunnel curving slightly, winding

5444
03:46:08.960 --> 03:46:10.020
one way to the next.

5445
03:46:11.310 --> 03:46:12.880
Little bits of rubble and bits of rock

5446
03:46:12.880 --> 03:46:16.610
that had fallen in just through time and erosion.

5447
03:46:16.610 --> 03:46:17.850
Who knows?

5448
03:46:17.850 --> 03:46:20.367
It's mostly just a smooth cylinder.

5449
03:46:23.550 --> 03:46:25.270
20 minutes go by.
SAM: Oof.

5450
03:46:25.270 --> 03:46:26.320
MATT: Frumpkin continues.

5451
03:46:27.582 --> 03:46:28.500
LAURA: Come inside!

5452
03:46:28.500 --> 03:46:29.650
Have a nice cup o' tea.

5453
03:46:31.040 --> 03:46:32.650
MATT: Come meet the missus.

5454
03:46:33.592 --> 03:46:35.250
LIAM: I would be looking through his eyes

5455
03:46:35.250 --> 03:46:39.190
for anything amiss, any secret worm doors

5456
03:46:39.190 --> 03:46:41.540
or anything like that, but you would have said.

5457
03:46:42.616 --> 03:46:43.910
It's a bit far.

5458
03:46:45.334 --> 03:46:46.960
I'm going to summon him back.

5459
03:46:47.860 --> 03:46:50.010
He just walked for a very long time,

5460
03:46:50.010 --> 03:46:51.881
and nothing changed and I'm returning,

5461
03:46:51.881 --> 03:46:54.980
and I will have him walk five minutes

5462
03:46:54.980 --> 03:46:56.660
in the other direction and see if it's anything different,

5463
03:46:56.660 --> 03:46:58.950
but it could be a very long tunnel.

5464
03:46:58.950 --> 03:47:01.345
TALIESIN: Well, we'll keep walking towards it anyway.

5465
03:47:01.345 --> 03:47:03.430
MATT: Okay, so you guys continue walking,

5466
03:47:03.430 --> 03:47:04.640
and you walking along with them

5467
03:47:04.640 --> 03:47:06.377
as you're meeting up with Frumpkin?

5468
03:47:06.377 --> 03:47:09.106
LIAM: No, I was going to have Frumpkin come back to the T.

5469
03:47:09.106 --> 03:47:09.939
MATT: Gotcha.

5470
03:47:09.939 --> 03:47:12.040
LIAM: Then go a little bit further in the other direction,

5471
03:47:12.040 --> 03:47:12.873
not as long.
MATT: Okay.

5472
03:47:12.873 --> 03:47:14.910
About 20 minutes, Frumpkin returns.

5473
03:47:14.910 --> 03:47:17.850
Frumpkin goes about five minutes the opposite direction

5474
03:47:17.850 --> 03:47:22.850
before he is met with the end of the tunnel,

5475
03:47:23.030 --> 03:47:26.230
full cave in collapse, large grated pile

5476
03:47:26.230 --> 03:47:27.330
of stones and rubble.

5477
03:47:27.330 --> 03:47:29.048
This side has just fallen in on itself.

5478
03:47:29.048 --> 03:47:30.896
(flask thumps)

5479
03:47:30.896 --> 03:47:32.608
(laughs)

5480
03:47:32.608 --> 03:47:36.220
SAM: I moved Matt's camera.
MATT: Eh, it's fine.

5481
03:47:37.540 --> 03:47:40.980
LIAM: That decides for us.
TRAVIS: Yeah, it does.

5482
03:47:42.000 --> 03:47:43.570
MARISHA: Let's go.

5483
03:47:43.570 --> 03:47:44.624
SAM: What does that decide?

5484
03:47:44.624 --> 03:47:48.170
LIAM: The left is caved in, so there's only one way to go.

5485
03:47:48.170 --> 03:47:51.810
SAM: Unless the cave in is a disguise of some sort.

5486
03:47:51.810 --> 03:47:53.440
TALIESIN: Well, we can also--
SAM: Go to inspect it.

5487
03:47:53.440 --> 03:47:55.960
LAURA: It was only five feet.

5488
03:47:55.960 --> 03:47:57.670
LIAM: Five minutes, but yeah.
LAURA: That's what I meant.

5489
03:47:57.670 --> 03:47:59.448
TRAVIS: Let's go check it out.

5490
03:47:59.448 --> 03:48:01.110
LAURA: Yeah!
MATT: All right.

5491
03:48:01.110 --> 03:48:03.686
You guys continue down the right path.

5492
03:48:03.686 --> 03:48:06.880
TALIESIN: Left to the cave in.
MATT: Left to the cave in.

5493
03:48:06.880 --> 03:48:08.490
TALIESIN: Just to check it out.

5494
03:48:08.490 --> 03:48:10.231
MATT: Okay. You guys head towards the cave in.

5495
03:48:10.231 --> 03:48:11.790
You finish the path and then you come to the base of it.

5496
03:48:11.790 --> 03:48:14.280
Stones of all sizes, large bits that have tumbled in,

5497
03:48:14.280 --> 03:48:15.690
smaller, broken up rubble.

5498
03:48:15.690 --> 03:48:17.800
It is just fully collapsed in.

5499
03:48:17.800 --> 03:48:18.633
LAURA: Touch the rocks.

5500
03:48:18.633 --> 03:48:19.624
LIAM: Touch a few places to make sure

5501
03:48:19.624 --> 03:48:20.749
it is physical and real.

5502
03:48:20.749 --> 03:48:23.010
MATT: Okay, it is physical.
TALIESIN: Detect Magic.

5503
03:48:24.140 --> 03:48:26.800
MATT: Focus for a second, close your eyes.

5504
03:48:26.800 --> 03:48:28.170
Nothing.

5505
03:48:28.170 --> 03:48:30.495
MARISHA: Does there appear to be any--

5506
03:48:30.495 --> 03:48:31.695
TRAVIS: --discernible ceiling?

5507
03:48:31.695 --> 03:48:33.510
MARISHA: Yeah, like ceiling that looks

5508
03:48:33.510 --> 03:48:36.020
like you could potentially peer over the rubbage.

5509
03:48:36.020 --> 03:48:37.750
MATT: Make a perception check.

5510
03:48:37.750 --> 03:48:39.467
TALIESIN: I'll join on that.

5511
03:48:43.300 --> 03:48:45.010
MARISHA: 13, 16 total.
MATT: Okay.

5512
03:48:45.010 --> 03:48:46.086
You do it as well.

5513
03:48:46.086 --> 03:48:47.900
You guys have to climb up a bit

5514
03:48:47.900 --> 03:48:49.590
to get to the edge of it to really see.

5515
03:48:49.590 --> 03:48:50.607
TALIESIN: 25.
MATT: 25, nice.

5516
03:48:50.607 --> 03:48:53.210
The way the ceiling is, it isn't like

5517
03:48:53.210 --> 03:48:55.170
just rocks are piled in.

5518
03:48:55.170 --> 03:48:57.170
The ceiling is actually falling in,

5519
03:48:57.170 --> 03:48:59.530
and it's this precarious situation

5520
03:48:59.530 --> 03:49:02.150
where the rubble is holding these large sections

5521
03:49:02.150 --> 03:49:05.200
of shale and heavy rock from falling in further.

5522
03:49:05.200 --> 03:49:09.284
It fully collapsed in and is just held

5523
03:49:09.284 --> 03:49:13.326
by a perfect meeting of both sides

5524
03:49:13.326 --> 03:49:17.370
kind of holding the weight.
TRAVIS: Not great.

5525
03:49:17.370 --> 03:49:19.812
TALIESIN: Can the cat get up there to take a look?

5526
03:49:19.812 --> 03:49:20.920
MATT: There is no gap.

5527
03:49:20.920 --> 03:49:24.818
It is literally like two bits are pushed together,

5528
03:49:24.818 --> 03:49:28.170
and it is a closed--
LAURA: I back away from it.

5529
03:49:28.170 --> 03:49:31.130
MARISHA: Yeah, I think we should be careful with cave ins.

5530
03:49:31.130 --> 03:49:32.300
Caduceus, catch me.

5531
03:49:32.300 --> 03:49:33.780
I'm just going to (grunts).

5532
03:49:34.767 --> 03:49:38.340
TRAVIS: Yeah, maybe things of the explosive variety

5533
03:49:38.340 --> 03:49:40.880
we try to limit if we can.
LAURA: Oh, smart.

5534
03:49:42.180 --> 03:49:43.558
SAM: The other way then?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

5535
03:49:43.558 --> 03:49:44.890
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
TRAVIS: Let's do it.

5536
03:49:44.890 --> 03:49:49.257
LIAM: Let's send my cat ten minutes ahead of us

5537
03:49:49.257 --> 03:49:50.355
and we'll just walk behind,

5538
03:49:50.355 --> 03:49:52.030
and the worst happens it happens

5539
03:49:52.030 --> 03:49:53.950
to him and I'll bring him back.

5540
03:49:53.950 --> 03:49:55.508
MATT: Okay, roll another perception check

5541
03:49:55.508 --> 03:49:56.529
for Frumpkin please.

5542
03:49:56.529 --> 03:49:58.210
TALIESIN: Anything watching us?

5543
03:49:59.500 --> 03:50:02.183
MATT: Perception check for you as well.

5544
03:50:02.183 --> 03:50:04.657
LAURA: I'm going to keep my hand along the wall

5545
03:50:04.657 --> 03:50:07.450
and see if there's any hidden things along the walls.

5546
03:50:07.450 --> 03:50:08.840
MARISHA: I'll do the other wall.

5547
03:50:08.840 --> 03:50:10.350
MATT: Okay, both of you guys make investigation checks

5548
03:50:10.350 --> 03:50:12.390
as you have your hands going, passing by.

5549
03:50:12.390 --> 03:50:13.223
TALIESIN: Nope.

5550
03:50:13.223 --> 03:50:16.033
MATT: What'd you get?
TALIESIN: I rolled a one.

5551
03:50:16.033 --> 03:50:17.500
MATT: One and a one on both perception checks.

5552
03:50:17.500 --> 03:50:18.333
Great.

5553
03:50:18.333 --> 03:50:20.045
MARISHA: We're supposed to be good at this.

5554
03:50:20.045 --> 03:50:21.136
Nine.
LAURA: Ten.

5555
03:50:21.136 --> 03:50:21.969
MATT: Okay.

5556
03:50:21.969 --> 03:50:25.738
You're rocking this, guys.

5557
03:50:25.738 --> 03:50:27.464
LIAM: Frumpkin's still out there.

5558
03:50:27.464 --> 03:50:29.400
Caleb's trailing behind Beau.

5559
03:50:29.400 --> 03:50:31.030
MATT: Frumpkin goes on, continues ahead.

5560
03:50:31.030 --> 03:50:34.203
You guys continue to walk and walk and walk.

5561
03:50:34.203 --> 03:50:37.180
The tunnel itself at a grade ever so faintly.

5562
03:50:37.180 --> 03:50:38.700
You're just winding side-to-side,

5563
03:50:38.700 --> 03:50:40.050
retracing Frumpkin's steps.

5564
03:50:40.910 --> 03:50:42.840
Continue on.

5565
03:50:42.840 --> 03:50:44.490
LAURA: Do we still see the footprints?

5566
03:50:45.460 --> 03:50:46.800
MATT: Off and on.

5567
03:50:46.800 --> 03:50:49.480
This area's less soft earth and more like hard rock,

5568
03:50:49.480 --> 03:50:50.670
and there's less of a chance

5569
03:50:50.670 --> 03:50:53.140
to actually witness footprints at this point.

5570
03:50:53.140 --> 03:50:54.410
You lose the trail,

5571
03:50:54.410 --> 03:50:56.710
but you recall the direction it was traveling.

5572
03:50:57.690 --> 03:50:58.800
You continue on.

5573
03:51:00.375 --> 03:51:03.560
Frumpkin eventually realizes the tunnel is curving

5574
03:51:03.560 --> 03:51:07.770
at more of a steeper and steeper slope,

5575
03:51:07.770 --> 03:51:08.603
to the point where it begins

5576
03:51:08.603 --> 03:51:10.990
to get a dangerous amount of steepness.

5577
03:51:10.990 --> 03:51:13.283
LIAM: Is it smooth?
MATT: It's smooth.

5578
03:51:13.283 --> 03:51:15.260
It's not like super smooth like a slide.

5579
03:51:15.260 --> 03:51:16.580
LIAM: It's not "The Goonies."
MATT: Right, right,

5580
03:51:16.580 --> 03:51:21.574
but it is a carved tunnel that continues to drop down.

5581
03:51:21.574 --> 03:51:23.690
You guys, being a bit behind Frumpkin,

5582
03:51:25.264 --> 03:51:27.740
pick up something that Frumpkin missed.

5583
03:51:27.740 --> 03:51:32.740
There is, off to the right side of the tunnel, an obelisk

5584
03:51:34.650 --> 03:51:35.990
that emerges from the ground,

5585
03:51:35.990 --> 03:51:40.080
rising up about 15 or so feet, four sides to it.

5586
03:51:40.080 --> 03:51:42.360
It comes to a gradual point, like a needle,

5587
03:51:43.230 --> 03:51:45.630
and it just sits there, different stone,

5588
03:51:47.420 --> 03:51:50.040
and it just barely comes into your periphery

5589
03:51:50.040 --> 03:51:52.150
and you all stop.
TALIESIN: Nope, nope, nope.

5590
03:51:52.150 --> 03:51:53.710
MARISHA: No one touch it.
TRAVIS: Touch it?

5591
03:51:53.710 --> 03:51:55.685
TALIESIN: Don't get anywhere near it.

5592
03:51:57.110 --> 03:51:58.179
TRAVIS: What color?

5593
03:51:59.262 --> 03:52:02.566
MATT: It's like a slate gray, like graphite almost.

5594
03:52:02.566 --> 03:52:05.370
LAURA: Are there any symbols on it that we can see?

5595
03:52:05.370 --> 03:52:07.240
MATT: You just came into your periphery.

5596
03:52:07.240 --> 03:52:08.460
You have to get closer to check.

5597
03:52:08.460 --> 03:52:09.907
TRAVIS: How far away are we at the moment?

5598
03:52:09.907 --> 03:52:11.744
MATT: Right now you're about 90 feet.

5599
03:52:11.744 --> 03:52:12.577
LAURA: Oof.

5600
03:52:12.577 --> 03:52:15.133
LIAM: We've stopped.

5601
03:52:15.133 --> 03:52:17.916
MARISHA: I would talk to you, but you can't hear me.

5602
03:52:19.341 --> 03:52:21.818
LIAM: Frumpkin is looking down a hill.

5603
03:52:21.818 --> 03:52:23.890
It's going down.

5604
03:52:23.890 --> 03:52:26.583
I'm going to hold because we're holding.

5605
03:52:26.583 --> 03:52:28.724
MARISHA: I give him a tap to let him know

5606
03:52:28.724 --> 03:52:29.557
we're in agreeance.

5607
03:52:29.557 --> 03:52:31.745
TRAVIS: Hey, Nott.
SAM: Huh?

5608
03:52:31.745 --> 03:52:34.133
TRAVIS: You want to sneak up?
SAM: No.

5609
03:52:35.555 --> 03:52:37.270
TRAVIS: You can do this.

5610
03:52:37.270 --> 03:52:38.210
SAM: I can?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

5611
03:52:39.059 --> 03:52:40.180
LAURA: Yeah.

5612
03:52:40.180 --> 03:52:41.320
TRAVIS: Just make sure there are no traps.

5613
03:52:41.320 --> 03:52:42.280
Just try and get close enough

5614
03:52:42.280 --> 03:52:43.410
to see if there's anything you can see.

5615
03:52:43.410 --> 03:52:45.362
Don't mess with it.

5616
03:52:45.362 --> 03:52:46.860
SAM: All right.

5617
03:52:46.860 --> 03:52:48.343
Sure.
(laughs)

5618
03:52:49.943 --> 03:52:51.350
I'll walk up to the obelisk.

5619
03:52:51.350 --> 03:52:53.310
MATT: Stealthily?
SAM: Nope.

5620
03:52:53.310 --> 03:52:54.970
LAURA: Wait.
(laughter)

5621
03:52:54.970 --> 03:52:56.970
SAM: I'll go look for traps.
MATT: Go for it.

5622
03:52:58.390 --> 03:53:00.650
SAM: Do I have to get right up on it to search?

5623
03:53:00.650 --> 03:53:02.600
MATT: Pretty close, within five feet or so.

5624
03:53:03.900 --> 03:53:04.733
SAM: Mm.

5625
03:53:06.060 --> 03:53:07.617
28.
MATT: Great.

5626
03:53:07.617 --> 03:53:09.520
You don't see any signs of traps.

5627
03:53:09.520 --> 03:53:10.540
You do notice two things.

5628
03:53:10.540 --> 03:53:15.540
One, there is writing along each side of the obelisk,

5629
03:53:15.944 --> 03:53:19.630
like vertical symbols that look like this.

5630
03:53:19.630 --> 03:53:21.607
SAM: Ooh, he's got things printed.

5631
03:53:21.607 --> 03:53:23.807
(exclamations)

5632
03:53:25.530 --> 03:53:27.490
MATT: Beyond that right side

5633
03:53:27.490 --> 03:53:30.830
where the obelisk is, there's another tunnel,

5634
03:53:30.830 --> 03:53:34.820
a small ten-foot by ten-foot square tunnel

5635
03:53:34.820 --> 03:53:37.170
that pushes to the right.

5636
03:53:38.359 --> 03:53:40.025
LAURA: Do we underst-- oh, we don't.

5637
03:53:40.025 --> 03:53:41.290
MARISHA: Do we know what that is?

5638
03:53:41.290 --> 03:53:42.739
MATT: What languages do you know?

5639
03:53:42.739 --> 03:53:44.178
SAM: Barely anything.

5640
03:53:44.178 --> 03:53:46.330
Common and Goblin.
MATT: You do not.

5641
03:53:46.330 --> 03:53:47.310
SAM: Oh, and Halfling.

5642
03:53:47.310 --> 03:53:48.720
MATT: You do not recognize this script at all.

5643
03:53:48.720 --> 03:53:50.390
TRAVIS: You know who does?

5644
03:53:51.300 --> 03:53:52.830
The wizard that can't hear or see anything.

5645
03:53:52.830 --> 03:53:54.590
Can I see Frumpkin up ahead?

5646
03:53:54.590 --> 03:53:57.260
MATT: No, Frumpkin is too far ahead for you to see.

5647
03:53:57.260 --> 03:53:58.093
TRAVIS: That's okay.

5648
03:53:58.093 --> 03:53:59.656
I'll take an Eldritch Blast and I'll just

5649
03:53:59.656 --> 03:54:01.940
shoot it down the hallway 120 feet.

5650
03:54:03.615 --> 03:54:06.610
MATT: It doesn't go 120 feet because the increasing arc,

5651
03:54:06.610 --> 03:54:07.770
it does eventually hit the ceiling.

5652
03:54:07.770 --> 03:54:08.730
From Frumpkin's vision,

5653
03:54:08.730 --> 03:54:09.640
you do see a (small explosion),

5654
03:54:09.640 --> 03:54:12.120
a burst of greenish-white energy

5655
03:54:12.120 --> 03:54:13.520
just behind and above.
LIAM: What is that?

5656
03:54:13.520 --> 03:54:15.353
Something's happening.

5657
03:54:17.793 --> 03:54:20.049
TALIESIN: Oh, good. You're back.

5658
03:54:20.049 --> 03:54:21.220
TRAVIS: Question for you.

5659
03:54:21.220 --> 03:54:23.452
There's some writing on this thing.

5660
03:54:23.452 --> 03:54:26.149
Can you tell us what it is?

5661
03:54:26.149 --> 03:54:28.647
LIAM: Yeah, yeah.

5662
03:54:28.647 --> 03:54:30.058
LAURA: Why didn't you tell us there

5663
03:54:30.058 --> 03:54:32.983
was an obelisk in front of us?

5664
03:54:32.983 --> 03:54:37.309
LIAM: We did not see an obelisk.

5665
03:54:37.309 --> 03:54:39.280
SAM: It's dark.
LAURA: Okay.

5666
03:54:40.405 --> 03:54:42.535
LIAM: I'm just doing my best.

5667
03:54:43.529 --> 03:54:46.120
Ten minutes, please.

5668
03:54:46.120 --> 03:54:47.310
MARISHA: Ten minutes?

5669
03:54:47.310 --> 03:54:49.154
LIAM: Start casting Comprehend Languages.

5670
03:54:49.154 --> 03:54:51.961
TALIESIN: Let's have a quick look to see

5671
03:54:51.961 --> 03:54:53.180
if anyone recognizes the language.

5672
03:54:53.180 --> 03:54:56.180
LIAM: I know Celestial and Sylvan.

5673
03:54:56.180 --> 03:54:57.013
MARISHA: Deep Speech.

5674
03:54:59.200 --> 03:55:00.980
MATT: You know any languages?
TRAVIS: Orc, baby.

5675
03:55:00.980 --> 03:55:02.140
MATT: Got it.
LAURA: Infernal.

5676
03:55:02.140 --> 03:55:03.849
LIAM: What's Orc Baby sound like?

5677
03:55:03.849 --> 03:55:04.760
(babbles)

5678
03:55:04.760 --> 03:55:06.730
TALIESIN: Giant and Elvish.
MATT: Okay.

5679
03:55:06.730 --> 03:55:09.260
ASHLEY: Abyssal and Celestial and Common.

5680
03:55:10.160 --> 03:55:12.229
MATT: You can read this.
MARISHA: Yeah!

5681
03:55:12.229 --> 03:55:14.800
TRAVIS: Fuck yeah!
MATT: One this to note,

5682
03:55:14.800 --> 03:55:19.133
the script has been defaced,

5683
03:55:19.133 --> 03:55:21.410
heavy scrape marks across it.

5684
03:55:21.410 --> 03:55:23.151
Someone has gone out of their way

5685
03:55:23.151 --> 03:55:26.820
to try and erase this script or deface it.

5686
03:55:26.820 --> 03:55:28.580
TRAVIS: Didn't we see that once before?

5687
03:55:28.580 --> 03:55:29.580
MARISHA: Yeah, does it look anything

5688
03:55:29.580 --> 03:55:33.913
like the carvings back in--

5689
03:55:33.913 --> 03:55:35.138
TRAVIS: Yeah there was the--

5690
03:55:35.138 --> 03:55:36.762
MARISHA: --Asarius?

5691
03:55:36.762 --> 03:55:39.123
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, where the succubus was.

5692
03:55:39.123 --> 03:55:40.130
MATT: This is different.

5693
03:55:40.130 --> 03:55:42.260
What you saw then were them chiseling

5694
03:55:42.260 --> 03:55:45.320
new markers into stone that weren't there before.

5695
03:55:45.320 --> 03:55:48.360
They were setting what was to be a gateway.

5696
03:55:48.360 --> 03:55:49.193
TRAVIS: Gotcha.

5697
03:55:49.193 --> 03:55:51.427
MATT: This looks like Abyssal symbols that have been

5698
03:55:51.427 --> 03:55:54.430
defaced, and long ago.
TRAVIS: What the fuck?

5699
03:55:54.430 --> 03:55:57.589
MATT: This is what you read.
MARISHA: Whoa!

5700
03:55:57.589 --> 03:56:00.161
TRAVIS: Come on, come on.
MARISHA: Several.

5701
03:56:00.161 --> 03:56:01.723
TALIESIN: Not looking.

5702
03:56:01.723 --> 03:56:03.633
LAURA: What does it say, Yasha?

5703
03:56:05.229 --> 03:56:07.913
ASHLEY: It says, build every bridge,

5704
03:56:09.211 --> 03:56:11.676
become every nightmare,

5705
03:56:11.676 --> 03:56:13.853
feast on every heart.

5706
03:56:13.853 --> 03:56:17.449
(groans)
SAM: Nope, nope. (laughs)

5707
03:56:17.449 --> 03:56:19.523
LIAM: Building bridges sounds nice.

5708
03:56:19.523 --> 03:56:21.623
SAM: What are we doing here?

5709
03:56:21.623 --> 03:56:23.748
LAURA: And it's written in Abyssal?

5710
03:56:23.748 --> 03:56:25.430
ASHLEY: Yeah, this is Abyssal.

5711
03:56:25.430 --> 03:56:27.861
LAURA: The entrance was in Celestial,

5712
03:56:27.861 --> 03:56:30.432
so it was probably the celestials

5713
03:56:30.432 --> 03:56:33.485
that tried to scratch this out, yeah?

5714
03:56:33.485 --> 03:56:34.930
TALIESIN: That would make sense.

5715
03:56:34.930 --> 03:56:36.160
LIAM: Build every bridge.

5716
03:56:36.160 --> 03:56:37.520
One more time, please, Yasha?

5717
03:56:37.520 --> 03:56:41.355
ASHLEY: Build every bridge, become every nightmare.

5718
03:56:41.355 --> 03:56:45.191
LAURA: ♪ Become every nightmare ♪

5719
03:56:45.191 --> 03:56:47.108
ASHLEY: Feast on every heart.

5720
03:56:48.018 --> 03:56:50.100
LAURA: Feast on every heart.

5721
03:56:50.100 --> 03:56:51.930
These people don't sound very nice.

5722
03:56:51.930 --> 03:56:54.091
ASHLEY: No.
TRAVIS: Build every bridge.

5723
03:56:54.091 --> 03:56:56.760
ASHLEY: Yeah, but build every bridge is pretty positive.

5724
03:56:56.760 --> 03:56:58.678
LIAM: That's what it says all around.

5725
03:56:58.678 --> 03:57:01.510
MATT: On each side it's the same script.

5726
03:57:01.510 --> 03:57:02.600
LIAM: Same script on each side.

5727
03:57:02.600 --> 03:57:03.433
TALIESIN: Have all four been--

5728
03:57:03.433 --> 03:57:05.138
MATT: All four have been defaced, yeah.

5729
03:57:05.138 --> 03:57:07.220
SAM: ♪ Till you find your ♪

5730
03:57:07.220 --> 03:57:09.610
LAURA: Maybe build every bridge means open

5731
03:57:09.610 --> 03:57:11.910
up the doorways between the world.

5732
03:57:11.910 --> 03:57:15.530
MARISHA: Yeah, which is what we've been seeing of a lot.

5733
03:57:15.530 --> 03:57:17.645
This is some cult shit.

5734
03:57:18.517 --> 03:57:19.780
TRAVIS: Are there any areas in the obelisk--

5735
03:57:19.780 --> 03:57:20.860
LAURA: This is the Angel of Irons.

5736
03:57:20.860 --> 03:57:23.835
TRAVIS: --that are inserts, any shapes that would be--

5737
03:57:23.835 --> 03:57:25.160
MATT: Make in investigation check.

5738
03:57:25.160 --> 03:57:26.940
LIAM: There's a new passage behind this, right?

5739
03:57:26.940 --> 03:57:28.746
MATT: There is, a hallway beyond that,

5740
03:57:28.746 --> 03:57:31.180
which the globes haven't been placed

5741
03:57:31.180 --> 03:57:32.870
in to get much of a presence.

5742
03:57:33.759 --> 03:57:36.790
TRAVIS: 24.

5743
03:57:36.790 --> 03:57:38.080
MATT: 24, good roll.

5744
03:57:38.080 --> 03:57:39.770
You do a thorough inspection

5745
03:57:39.770 --> 03:57:42.800
and you feel confident that there is no slot,

5746
03:57:42.800 --> 03:57:45.410
nothing beyond just it being a marker.

5747
03:57:46.920 --> 03:57:49.340
LIAM: The way that we were headed,

5748
03:57:49.340 --> 03:57:50.520
where Frumpkin was going,

5749
03:57:50.520 --> 03:57:51.930
it just slopes down--

5750
03:57:51.930 --> 03:57:54.910
MATT: Slopes down to a point where it would be--

5751
03:57:54.910 --> 03:57:55.800
LIAM: Untenable?

5752
03:57:55.800 --> 03:57:57.540
MATT: Untenable without the help of magic,

5753
03:57:57.540 --> 03:58:00.148
and who knows where it goes.
LIAM: Yeah.

5754
03:58:00.148 --> 03:58:03.414
Do we want to push some light in here?

5755
03:58:03.414 --> 03:58:05.100
TALIESIN: Let's do that.

5756
03:58:05.100 --> 03:58:06.410
LAURA: ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ♪

5757
03:58:06.410 --> 03:58:07.243
TALIESIN: I think so.

5758
03:58:07.243 --> 03:58:08.420
MATT: Okay, the globes go in,

5759
03:58:08.420 --> 03:58:13.370
and about 50 or so feet down this ten-by-ten hallway,

5760
03:58:13.370 --> 03:58:15.800
you see a set of doors, stone doors,

5761
03:58:15.800 --> 03:58:20.370
that are pushed open inward, leaving a two-foot gap.

5762
03:58:20.370 --> 03:58:21.280
The doors have already been opened,

5763
03:58:21.280 --> 03:58:22.643
and they're just left ajar.

5764
03:58:22.643 --> 03:58:25.220
You can see carvings in each door,

5765
03:58:25.220 --> 03:58:27.120
but you have to be closer to make

5766
03:58:27.120 --> 03:58:28.530
out the detail with the low light.

5767
03:58:28.530 --> 03:58:30.786
SAM: Any fresh footprints leading up to them?

5768
03:58:32.003 --> 03:58:34.470
MATT: Make a perception check.
SAM: Oh, perception?

5769
03:58:34.470 --> 03:58:36.040
Three.
MATT: Three?

5770
03:58:36.040 --> 03:58:37.140
Can't catch anything.

5771
03:58:40.170 --> 03:58:41.003
LIAM: Here.

5772
03:58:41.003 --> 03:58:44.462
I pick up Frumpkin and I set him on Nott's shoulders.

5773
03:58:44.462 --> 03:58:47.000
Go sneak up there so I can get a look

5774
03:58:47.000 --> 03:58:48.060
at that writing, will you?

5775
03:58:48.060 --> 03:58:49.140
Quietly.

5776
03:58:49.140 --> 03:58:51.285
SAM: Okay.
LIAM: Yeah.

5777
03:58:51.285 --> 03:58:53.400
I take out a rag--
LAURA: As sneaky as possible.

5778
03:58:53.400 --> 03:58:55.550
LIAM: --and put it over one of the globules,

5779
03:58:56.425 --> 03:58:59.900
and it floats, dim, covered.

5780
03:59:02.007 --> 03:59:03.028
SAM: Stealth?

5781
03:59:03.028 --> 03:59:04.871
LIAM: Carefully, please.

5782
03:59:07.354 --> 03:59:08.187
SAM: All right.

5783
03:59:09.450 --> 03:59:11.915
27 for stealth.

5784
03:59:13.298 --> 03:59:15.423
MATT: All right. You stealthily make your way up

5785
03:59:15.423 --> 03:59:16.439
with the globe.

5786
03:59:17.560 --> 03:59:20.940
TALIESIN: Covered globe.
SAM: Globe, light?

5787
03:59:20.940 --> 03:59:22.750
LIAM: Dim uncovered, so very dim.

5788
03:59:22.750 --> 03:59:24.090
SAM: I'm got darkvision.

5789
03:59:24.090 --> 03:59:25.100
I don't need it, probably.

5790
03:59:25.100 --> 03:59:27.235
LIAM: But I need to see.
SAM: Oh.

5791
03:59:27.235 --> 03:59:28.670
MATT: Okay.
SAM: All right.

5792
03:59:28.670 --> 03:59:29.840
MATT: You're watching through--

5793
03:59:29.840 --> 03:59:31.620
LIAM: Through Frumpkin's eyes, sitting on Nott's shoulder.

5794
03:59:31.620 --> 03:59:33.930
MATT: You approach the doors that are partially

5795
03:59:33.930 --> 03:59:36.324
open this way from your perspective.

5796
03:59:36.324 --> 03:59:41.057
You can see a chamber opens beyond them, no light either,

5797
03:59:41.957 --> 03:59:44.280
and as you approach you can see the reliefs

5798
03:59:44.280 --> 03:59:48.170
on these doors are actually sculptures, humanoid.

5799
03:59:49.030 --> 03:59:51.695
You see two figures, one on each door,

5800
03:59:52.570 --> 03:59:54.511
beautiful alabaster,

5801
03:59:55.886 --> 03:59:57.869
humanoid features,

5802
03:59:59.540 --> 04:00:02.626
smooth skin, no hair,

5803
04:00:02.626 --> 04:00:07.626
looks like folded wings on their back, robes,

5804
04:00:08.638 --> 04:00:11.312
and they're both just blank expressions.

5805
04:00:11.312 --> 04:00:13.550
SAM: How far are the figures in there?

5806
04:00:13.550 --> 04:00:15.564
MATT: Well, they're on the doors.

5807
04:00:15.564 --> 04:00:18.047
SAM: Oh, they're at the doors that I'm just at the cusp of?

5808
04:00:18.047 --> 04:00:18.880
MATT: You walk up and you approach

5809
04:00:18.880 --> 04:00:21.728
and you see these as you approach.

5810
04:00:21.728 --> 04:00:24.537
You also see, as you get closer,

5811
04:00:27.550 --> 04:00:30.310
trails of crimson down the front of the statues.

5812
04:00:30.310 --> 04:00:32.211
SAM: Sure, sure.

5813
04:00:32.211 --> 04:00:34.060
These are statues, again, on the door?

5814
04:00:34.060 --> 04:00:34.940
MATT: On the doors.
SAM: Okay.

5815
04:00:34.940 --> 04:00:36.840
LAURA: So the doors--
Oh, god.

5816
04:00:36.840 --> 04:00:38.310
LIAM: That red is painted?

5817
04:00:38.310 --> 04:00:40.710
It's by design, obviously?

5818
04:00:40.710 --> 04:00:42.305
MATT: You'd have to get closer to see.

5819
04:00:42.305 --> 04:00:44.038
SAM: I'll touch and see if it's--

5820
04:00:44.038 --> 04:00:44.913
Is it wet?

5821
04:00:44.913 --> 04:00:46.471
MATT: It is wet.

5822
04:00:46.471 --> 04:00:48.274
TRAVIS: Yeah!

5823
04:00:48.274 --> 04:00:50.538
SAM: Does it taste like blood?

5824
04:00:50.538 --> 04:00:52.071
MATT: It tastes very ironlike.

5825
04:00:52.071 --> 04:00:52.904
MARISHA: Ooh!

5826
04:00:54.029 --> 04:00:55.440
LAURA: Oh, gross!

5827
04:00:55.440 --> 04:00:57.160
MATT: You can see it trailing down the front

5828
04:00:57.160 --> 04:00:59.370
and down at the bottom, at the base of the doors,

5829
04:00:59.370 --> 04:01:01.800
there's a small pool where they've dragged--

5830
04:01:01.800 --> 04:01:06.065
and it looks like this is a recent thing.

5831
04:01:07.512 --> 04:01:09.460
MARISHA: This was how they opened the doors.

5832
04:01:09.460 --> 04:01:11.230
SAM: I take the little kitty cat

5833
04:01:11.230 --> 04:01:12.920
and give it a little kiss. (smooches)

5834
04:01:12.920 --> 04:01:14.280
I love you, Frumpkin.

5835
04:01:14.280 --> 04:01:15.600
Put it down and go invisible,

5836
04:01:15.600 --> 04:01:17.173
and I'm going to go in the door.

5837
04:01:17.173 --> 04:01:18.687
TRAVIS: Yeah!

5838
04:01:18.687 --> 04:01:20.230
MATT: Okay.

5839
04:01:20.230 --> 04:01:23.460
You guys watch as at the core end there's the slight globe.

5840
04:01:23.460 --> 04:01:25.760
Frumpkin gets placed down and Nott just (exhales)

5841
04:01:25.760 --> 04:01:27.720
vanishes from sight.
TALIESIN: Oh, no.

5842
04:01:27.720 --> 04:01:30.169
LAURA: She's not even drunk.
MARISHA: It checks out.

5843
04:01:30.169 --> 04:01:33.417
LIAM: I've relayed that to the group, since they were ahead.

5844
04:01:33.417 --> 04:01:34.570
TRAVIS: We can't let her go in there by herself.

5845
04:01:34.570 --> 04:01:36.040
LAURA: She's not even drunk!

5846
04:01:36.040 --> 04:01:37.568
MARISHA: We don't want to run in.

5847
04:01:37.568 --> 04:01:39.397
It'll totally fuck everything over.

5848
04:01:39.397 --> 04:01:41.136
TRAVIS: I look behind us. Anything there?

5849
04:01:41.136 --> 04:01:42.411
MATT: Make a perception check.

5850
04:01:45.670 --> 04:01:46.811
TRAVIS: 11.

5851
04:01:46.811 --> 04:01:47.794
MATT: Best to your knowledge,

5852
04:01:47.794 --> 04:01:50.300
nothing seems to be nearby behind you.

5853
04:01:50.300 --> 04:01:52.400
LIAM: I tell Frumpkin to go in behind the door

5854
04:01:52.400 --> 04:01:54.307
and the wall of whatever is in there,

5855
04:01:54.307 --> 04:01:55.940
and try to see anything.

5856
04:01:55.940 --> 04:01:57.270
MATT: You're still focusing on Frumpkin.

5857
04:01:57.270 --> 04:01:58.960
LIAM: I'm not sending the light in, though,

5858
04:01:58.960 --> 04:02:00.440
because I don't know what the hell is in there,

5859
04:02:00.440 --> 04:02:01.930
so Frumpkin is sitting in there.

5860
04:02:01.930 --> 04:02:03.460
MATT: All right, perception check

5861
04:02:03.460 --> 04:02:05.030
with disadvantage on Frumpkin.

5862
04:02:05.030 --> 04:02:06.740
Standard perception check for you, please.

5863
04:02:06.740 --> 04:02:08.150
SAM: I don't do perception.

5864
04:02:08.150 --> 04:02:09.661
12.
MATT: Okay.

5865
04:02:09.661 --> 04:02:11.254
LIAM: 17 and three.

5866
04:02:11.254 --> 04:02:12.630
MATT: You enter.

5867
04:02:12.630 --> 04:02:14.680
There is no continuation of the tunnel.

5868
04:02:14.680 --> 04:02:16.930
As you walk through the doors,

5869
04:02:16.930 --> 04:02:20.094
you are in a subterranean courtyard,

5870
04:02:20.094 --> 04:02:21.620
(gasping)

5871
04:02:21.620 --> 04:02:24.140
a crescent that if you're standing at the doors

5872
04:02:24.140 --> 04:02:29.131
opens up around a large,

5873
04:02:29.131 --> 04:02:31.980
somewhat curved wall, floor-to-ceiling.

5874
04:02:31.980 --> 04:02:34.886
If you were to imagine a tower was buried

5875
04:02:34.886 --> 04:02:37.490
and you uncovered one side,

5876
04:02:37.490 --> 04:02:40.979
there is a courtyard that sits

5877
04:02:40.979 --> 04:02:44.072
right around this heavy wall.

5878
04:02:45.600 --> 04:02:50.253
The ground is uneven with rocks and scraps of metal.

5879
04:02:51.444 --> 04:02:54.372
Parts of it look like a scattered junkyard almost,

5880
04:02:54.372 --> 04:02:59.037
and there are all of these statues,

5881
04:02:59.037 --> 04:03:01.950
all humanoid, sitting, all facing this wall,

5882
04:03:01.950 --> 04:03:04.115
probably a dozen or so.

5883
04:03:05.280 --> 04:03:07.590
They all appear to be of a white stone,

5884
04:03:07.590 --> 04:03:12.490
smooth head, no hair, folded wings across the back,

5885
04:03:12.490 --> 04:03:16.330
robes, all sitting and all facing this structure.

5886
04:03:16.330 --> 04:03:18.383
TALIESIN: Oh.
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck!

5887
04:03:18.383 --> 04:03:21.260
SAM: This structure is, again, it's a platform?

5888
04:03:21.260 --> 04:03:23.010
It's a stage? It's a--

5889
04:03:23.010 --> 04:03:24.800
MATT: No, it's a curved wall.

5890
04:03:24.800 --> 04:03:27.460
It's like you're walking to the outside

5891
04:03:27.460 --> 04:03:29.320
of a tower of some kind.

5892
04:03:29.320 --> 04:03:31.540
LIAM: A courtyard outside a tower.
MATT: Correct.

5893
04:03:31.540 --> 04:03:33.680
There's a courtyard that you're in,

5894
04:03:33.680 --> 04:03:35.180
and then there's just

5895
04:03:35.180 --> 04:03:40.133
a wall, like an exterior wall of something beyond.

5896
04:03:40.133 --> 04:03:41.270
SAM: Is there a door?

5897
04:03:41.270 --> 04:03:42.675
MATT: You'd have to get closer to look.

5898
04:03:42.675 --> 04:03:44.160
TRAVIS: Go look, baby.
SAM: Yeah, of course.

5899
04:03:44.160 --> 04:03:45.290
I'll go look.
MATT: Okay.

5900
04:03:45.290 --> 04:03:47.180
You walk through and you're looking left to right.

5901
04:03:47.180 --> 04:03:50.060
All these statues, all these angelic statues,

5902
04:03:50.060 --> 04:03:52.519
also bleeding from the eyes.

5903
04:03:52.519 --> 04:03:54.031
(groans)
LAURA: Fuck, fuck, fuck.

5904
04:03:54.031 --> 04:03:55.300
TRAVIS: (laughs giddily)

5905
04:03:55.300 --> 04:03:57.110
LAURA: ♪ We are fucked ♪

5906
04:03:57.110 --> 04:04:00.524
MATT: You can see the piles of rubble.

5907
04:04:00.524 --> 04:04:03.723
You see a broken sword on one side.

5908
04:04:04.881 --> 04:04:06.210
You haven't even paid much attention

5909
04:04:06.210 --> 04:04:08.927
to what is scattered amongst the floor here.

5910
04:04:08.927 --> 04:04:11.420
As you approach this large wall,

5911
04:04:11.420 --> 04:04:15.894
it looks of almost

5912
04:04:15.894 --> 04:04:19.280
a deep, black stone,

5913
04:04:19.280 --> 04:04:21.756
no windows, and there are grooves

5914
04:04:21.756 --> 04:04:23.000
about every ten feet or so

5915
04:04:23.000 --> 04:04:25.810
that just striate up the side.

5916
04:04:25.810 --> 04:04:30.410
You can see a single adamantine door

5917
04:04:30.410 --> 04:04:33.260
that sits in the center of the courtyard,

5918
04:04:33.260 --> 04:04:35.208
in the center of the wall,

5919
04:04:35.208 --> 04:04:36.730
that is raised up about two feet.

5920
04:04:36.730 --> 04:04:38.213
LAURA: No!

5921
04:04:38.213 --> 04:04:40.768
MATT: And the path continues below it.

5922
04:04:40.768 --> 04:04:42.020
MARISHA: Underneath?
SAM: Oh, it's been lifted up.

5923
04:04:42.020 --> 04:04:42.862
MATT: It's been lifted up.

5924
04:04:42.862 --> 04:04:45.773
MARISHA: But only two feet.
MATT: But only two feet.

5925
04:04:45.773 --> 04:04:47.560
Or about a foot and a half.

5926
04:04:47.560 --> 04:04:49.891
LIAM: Not enough blood.
MARISHA: Not enough blood.

5927
04:04:49.891 --> 04:04:51.516
Straight up.

5928
04:04:51.516 --> 04:04:53.130
Not enough to power the wheel.

5929
04:04:53.130 --> 04:04:54.697
ASHLEY: I'm going to walk in.

5930
04:04:54.697 --> 04:04:56.919
MATT: You walk in after Nott?
ASHLEY: Mm-hmm.

5931
04:04:56.919 --> 04:04:58.587
TALIESIN: I'm going to just tap Death Ward as

5932
04:04:58.587 --> 04:05:01.553
you're walking away. Oh, that's not-- okay.

5933
04:05:01.553 --> 04:05:02.428
MATT: So you have Death Ward

5934
04:05:02.428 --> 04:05:03.261
on you for the next eight hours.

5935
04:05:03.261 --> 04:05:04.491
TRAVIS: We're going in with her. Come on.

5936
04:05:04.491 --> 04:05:05.770
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm going to flank the doors

5937
04:05:05.770 --> 04:05:07.430
but let her go ahead.

5938
04:05:07.430 --> 04:05:10.988
MATT: Okay. You guys come into the chamber behind Nott.

5939
04:05:10.988 --> 04:05:12.079
TRAVIS: Summon the falchion.

5940
04:05:12.079 --> 04:05:14.150
MATT: You take in the same scenery around you.

5941
04:05:14.150 --> 04:05:16.002
You see the large door.

5942
04:05:16.002 --> 04:05:19.490
The door's like 20 feet wide and about 15 feet tall

5943
04:05:19.490 --> 04:05:21.490
from what you can see as it's lifted up,

5944
04:05:23.203 --> 04:05:25.380
and the same scattering of the courtyard

5945
04:05:25.380 --> 04:05:26.690
around you, the same statues.

5946
04:05:26.690 --> 04:05:29.182
TRAVIS: Can someone tell if this shit's evil or not?

5947
04:05:29.182 --> 04:05:30.802
LIAM: Just throw up Mage Armor.
TALIESIN: It doesn't look it.

5948
04:05:30.802 --> 04:05:35.443
SAM: As I watch Yasha walk in, I am going to stealthily

5949
04:05:37.300 --> 04:05:39.370
search her pockets for anything.

5950
04:05:39.370 --> 04:05:41.420
MATT: All right, make a sleight of hand check.

5951
04:05:42.630 --> 04:05:45.576
SAM: Natural 20.
(laughter)

5952
04:05:45.576 --> 04:05:46.676
MATT: What does Nott find?

5953
04:05:49.010 --> 04:05:52.390
ASHLEY: A couple of coins, some flowers,

5954
04:05:52.390 --> 04:05:54.909
maybe some sunflower seeds.

5955
04:05:54.909 --> 04:05:55.992
SAM: Fuck!

5956
04:05:56.900 --> 04:05:58.025
ASHLEY: Nothing.

5957
04:05:59.980 --> 04:06:00.813
SAM: Sorry.

5958
04:06:00.813 --> 04:06:02.770
ASHLEY: Yasha is not one for material items.

5959
04:06:02.770 --> 04:06:05.195
SAM: Sorry, it's me. It's just me. I'm here.

5960
04:06:07.630 --> 04:06:11.658
ASHLEY: Can I look around the room

5961
04:06:11.658 --> 04:06:16.658
and perception check to take in the room?

5962
04:06:16.771 --> 04:06:18.604
MATT: Yeah, make a perception check.

5963
04:06:22.945 --> 04:06:25.767
ASHLEY: (laughs) I just rolled a natural one.

5964
04:06:27.390 --> 04:06:29.814
MATT: It's hard to look around.

5965
04:06:29.814 --> 04:06:31.150
There's an ominous sense here,

5966
04:06:31.150 --> 04:06:34.790
and you sense this weird tickle,

5967
04:06:34.790 --> 04:06:38.156
like something is just near you. (laughs)

5968
04:06:38.156 --> 04:06:39.414
ASHLEY: Do I--

5969
04:06:45.178 --> 04:06:47.727
Is this place familiar to me?

5970
04:06:49.041 --> 04:06:50.099
MATT: No.

5971
04:06:52.035 --> 04:06:52.920
ASHLEY: Okay.

5972
04:06:52.920 --> 04:06:55.190
LIAM: I work a lot with substances and materials.

5973
04:06:55.190 --> 04:06:57.501
If I look at the blood on one of these statue's faces,

5974
04:06:57.501 --> 04:06:59.640
am I able to investigate it to tell

5975
04:06:59.640 --> 04:07:03.710
how long ago this was become wet?

5976
04:07:03.710 --> 04:07:05.640
MATT: Sure, make a medicine check.
LIAM: Medicine.

5977
04:07:05.640 --> 04:07:06.800
TRAVIS: Ooh, yeah.

5978
04:07:06.800 --> 04:07:08.720
MATT: This is to know the consistency

5979
04:07:08.720 --> 04:07:10.990
and coagulation of a blood-like substance.

5980
04:07:10.990 --> 04:07:12.130
LIAM: 16.
MATT: 16.

5981
04:07:12.130 --> 04:07:14.292
SAM: Coagulation check.
MATT: Indeed.

5982
04:07:15.900 --> 04:07:19.138
This is maybe a day old, to two days old.

5983
04:07:19.138 --> 04:07:20.790
LAURA: The blood looks like it's actually

5984
04:07:20.790 --> 04:07:22.177
coming from the statue?

5985
04:07:22.177 --> 04:07:23.870
MATT: As you inspect and get close

5986
04:07:23.870 --> 04:07:25.373
to the statue and look,

5987
04:07:25.373 --> 04:07:28.934
it is a very slow, gradual stream.

5988
04:07:28.934 --> 04:07:30.940
It is actually producing the blood.

5989
04:07:30.940 --> 04:07:33.140
SAM: And it's still coming?
MATT: It is still coming.

5990
04:07:33.140 --> 04:07:35.137
TRAVIS: I'm fucking wigging out.

5991
04:07:35.137 --> 04:07:36.990
MARISHA: In those striations on the wall,

5992
04:07:36.990 --> 04:07:39.590
do they have blood trickling down them or up them?

5993
04:07:39.590 --> 04:07:42.150
MATT: They do not have blood at all on them.

5994
04:07:42.150 --> 04:07:43.361
MARISHA: They do not.

5995
04:07:43.361 --> 04:07:44.930
LIAM: Just an aspect of the stone?
MATT: Correct.

5996
04:07:44.930 --> 04:07:46.090
TRAVIS: The base of the statues, does it look

5997
04:07:46.090 --> 04:07:49.640
like they've rotated or disturbed the earth at all?

5998
04:07:49.640 --> 04:07:51.430
MATT: Make an investigation check

5999
04:07:51.430 --> 04:07:52.980
to check the floor around them.

6000
04:07:55.040 --> 04:07:56.560
TRAVIS: 20.
MATT: 20!

6001
04:07:56.560 --> 04:07:59.150
TRAVIS: 19, sorry.
MATT: Okay, no worries.

6002
04:07:59.150 --> 04:08:00.582
No, the statues have not been moved.

6003
04:08:00.582 --> 04:08:02.410
They are stationary and appear

6004
04:08:02.410 --> 04:08:04.885
to have been placed there intentionally.

6005
04:08:06.134 --> 04:08:07.380
But you do look around the base too

6006
04:08:07.380 --> 04:08:09.610
and find amongst the dirt and rubble

6007
04:08:09.610 --> 04:08:11.240
that's in the vicinity as you look around,

6008
04:08:11.240 --> 04:08:15.370
you find ruined feathers of white.

6009
04:08:15.370 --> 04:08:19.850
You find they've been dirtied with age and dust.

6010
04:08:19.850 --> 04:08:21.760
You look and can see other shattered swords

6011
04:08:21.760 --> 04:08:24.210
and broken armor covered in soot

6012
04:08:24.210 --> 04:08:27.533
that's just been left and dusted over,

6013
04:08:27.533 --> 04:08:29.180
twisted beyond use.

6014
04:08:31.560 --> 04:08:33.110
And because you rolled so well,

6015
04:08:34.000 --> 04:08:35.670
you glance over to one of these suits

6016
04:08:35.670 --> 04:08:37.600
of armor off to the left side of it,

6017
04:08:37.600 --> 04:08:41.680
and you see this little exposed flash of white

6018
04:08:41.680 --> 04:08:45.270
amongst one of the pieces of twisted armor.

6019
04:08:45.270 --> 04:08:46.870
TRAVIS: I'll go over and check it out.

6020
04:08:46.870 --> 04:08:50.160
MATT: You pull it and it's a bone,

6021
04:08:50.160 --> 04:08:54.690
but smooth, pure,

6022
04:08:54.690 --> 04:08:56.210
just covered in a pile of dirt.

6023
04:08:56.210 --> 04:08:58.662
TRAVIS: No grime, no-- just--?

6024
04:08:58.662 --> 04:09:01.436
MATT: Well, you see an exposed part of it and it's just--

6025
04:09:01.436 --> 04:09:03.134
TRAVIS: I pull on it.

6026
04:09:03.134 --> 04:09:04.480
MATT: Okay, you tug on it and as you pull it out,

6027
04:09:04.480 --> 04:09:06.030
all the dirt just falls off of it

6028
04:09:06.030 --> 04:09:08.410
like it never quite held onto it.

6029
04:09:08.410 --> 04:09:09.680
You glance down and there's more.

6030
04:09:09.680 --> 04:09:11.370
There's actually probably a mostly

6031
04:09:11.370 --> 04:09:13.480
buried skeleton amongst this piece of armor.

6032
04:09:13.480 --> 04:09:14.988
TRAVIS: Does the bone look like it's

6033
04:09:14.988 --> 04:09:17.229
humanoid in size or larger?

6034
04:09:17.229 --> 04:09:18.320
MATT: It looks a little larger.

6035
04:09:18.320 --> 04:09:21.412
LIAM: Yeah, I want to join Fjord, and I speak Celestial

6036
04:09:21.412 --> 04:09:22.880
so I've probably studied this.

6037
04:09:22.880 --> 04:09:26.707
Does it look like an aasimar's bone?

6038
04:09:27.887 --> 04:09:29.737
MATT: You've studied Celestial as a language,

6039
04:09:29.737 --> 04:09:30.853
but you've had--

6040
04:09:30.853 --> 04:09:35.378
I'd say go ahead and make a religion check for me.

6041
04:09:35.378 --> 04:09:36.211
TRAVIS: While he's doing that,

6042
04:09:36.211 --> 04:09:38.120
are all these statues in the same pose?

6043
04:09:38.120 --> 04:09:38.953
MATT: They are.

6044
04:09:38.953 --> 04:09:40.920
TRAVIS: Are they all on pedestals or feet on--

6045
04:09:40.920 --> 04:09:43.208
MATT: They're all sitting on the ground.

6046
04:09:43.208 --> 04:09:45.424
Their hands are just sitting in their lap.

6047
04:09:45.424 --> 04:09:47.011
LAURA: Oh, they're on their knees?

6048
04:09:47.011 --> 04:09:49.450
MATT: They're all sitting on their knees looking forward,

6049
04:09:49.450 --> 04:09:52.210
and the blood that's coming down is pooling

6050
04:09:52.210 --> 04:09:53.870
in their hands and has spilled off

6051
04:09:53.870 --> 04:09:55.320
into the dirt in front of it.

6052
04:09:56.400 --> 04:09:58.875
LIAM: 16.
MATT: 16.

6053
04:09:58.875 --> 04:10:00.795
Looking through and rummaging around,

6054
04:10:00.795 --> 04:10:03.926
you can see bones that appear to have been part of wings,

6055
04:10:03.926 --> 04:10:07.158
and you gather that these entities were Celestial

6056
04:10:07.158 --> 04:10:09.270
in some degree.
LIAM: Okay.

6057
04:10:09.270 --> 04:10:10.702
MATT: There's a skull.

6058
04:10:10.702 --> 04:10:15.530
There's a full skeletal corpse there of this creature.

6059
04:10:15.530 --> 04:10:17.830
LIAM: Holding a bone, I just look over at Yasha.

6060
04:10:21.585 --> 04:10:23.518
ASHLEY: I go over and I look at it.

6061
04:10:25.867 --> 04:10:27.410
(groans)

6062
04:10:27.410 --> 04:10:30.005
MATT: Now that you have this information, you look around.

6063
04:10:30.005 --> 04:10:34.609
There's probably a handful of celestial corpses

6064
04:10:34.609 --> 04:10:36.460
buried amongst the refuse here.

6065
04:10:36.460 --> 04:10:41.460
TRAVIS: Any non-broken weapons or non-ruined armor pieces?

6066
04:10:41.480 --> 04:10:42.770
MATT: You can make an investigation check

6067
04:10:42.770 --> 04:10:45.091
to try and give the whole room a once-over if you like.

6068
04:10:45.091 --> 04:10:46.767
It'll take you a little while, but you can do it.

6069
04:10:46.767 --> 04:10:47.600
TRAVIS: I'll try.

6070
04:10:47.600 --> 04:10:51.260
LAURA: Maybe these statues were the people that fell.

6071
04:10:51.260 --> 04:10:52.093
ASHLEY: Yeah.

6072
04:10:52.093 --> 04:10:53.991
LAURA: You know, the people that died trying to--

6073
04:10:53.991 --> 04:10:57.066
TRAVIS: 25. Natural 19.

6074
04:10:57.066 --> 04:10:58.680
LAURA: Entomb this guy.
ASHLEY: Maybe they're good people.

6075
04:10:58.680 --> 04:11:00.600
TALIESIN: I'm going to help with a Detect Magic

6076
04:11:00.600 --> 04:11:03.405
while we're in the room, too.
MATT: Okay.

6077
04:11:03.405 --> 04:11:04.520
Glancing around, all the statues

6078
04:11:04.520 --> 04:11:07.374
give off a faint magical essence,

6079
04:11:07.374 --> 04:11:09.435
so immediately the whole room just lights up around you.

6080
04:11:09.435 --> 04:11:11.693
TRAVIS: The statues give off--?
MATT: The statues do.

6081
04:11:12.650 --> 04:11:16.060
Looking around, there are no unruined weapons.

6082
04:11:16.060 --> 04:11:17.960
All the armor and weaponry here

6083
04:11:17.960 --> 04:11:20.718
has been sundered in some way a long time ago.

6084
04:11:20.718 --> 04:11:21.551
TRAVIS: Fuck!

6085
04:11:21.551 --> 04:11:23.335
TALIESIN: If it were magical, it wouldn't be sundered.

6086
04:11:23.335 --> 04:11:25.118
MATT: Anything of value was probably taken

6087
04:11:25.118 --> 04:11:27.134
or just disappeared.

6088
04:11:28.914 --> 04:11:31.460
ASHLEY: I want to go up closer to one of the statues

6089
04:11:31.460 --> 04:11:32.930
and just get a closer look,

6090
04:11:32.930 --> 04:11:37.930
because I haven't quite seen anything like that before.

6091
04:11:39.570 --> 04:11:42.570
MATT: They're a little larger than humanoid,

6092
04:11:42.570 --> 04:11:43.930
their proportions are a little larger,

6093
04:11:43.930 --> 04:11:48.210
a little bigger than you or anybody else you've come across.

6094
04:11:51.113 --> 04:11:53.213
What do you inspect? What do you do with the statues?

6095
04:11:53.213 --> 04:11:55.180
ASHLEY: See their wings, and--

6096
04:11:57.988 --> 04:11:59.680
I kind of want to touch it.

6097
04:11:59.680 --> 04:12:02.370
MATT: Okay. You go ahead and reach out and touch the statue,

6098
04:12:02.370 --> 04:12:04.996
and there's a very faint vibration to it.

6099
04:12:04.996 --> 04:12:06.620
You run your fingers across it

6100
04:12:06.620 --> 04:12:11.050
and it just thrums and get stronger and lesser

6101
04:12:11.050 --> 04:12:12.060
in an inconsistent pattern

6102
04:12:12.060 --> 04:12:13.910
of vibration as you touch it.

6103
04:12:15.810 --> 04:12:17.450
ASHLEY: Nott, did you--

6104
04:12:17.450 --> 04:12:19.180
SAM: I'm over here!

6105
04:12:19.180 --> 04:12:20.930
ASHLEY: Did you feel something funny

6106
04:12:20.930 --> 04:12:23.171
when you touched the statue?

6107
04:12:24.410 --> 04:12:26.380
SAM: I don't think so.
MATT: You didn't really touch it.

6108
04:12:26.380 --> 04:12:28.490
SAM: I just touched the blood.
MATT: Blood, yeah.

6109
04:12:28.490 --> 04:12:30.270
MARISHA: What do you mean "funny?"

6110
04:12:30.270 --> 04:12:32.445
SAM: I didn't sense anything.

6111
04:12:32.445 --> 04:12:33.770
ASHLEY: It vibrates.

6112
04:12:33.770 --> 04:12:36.046
Probably-- Give it a try.

6113
04:12:36.046 --> 04:12:37.371
MATT: You feel another statue

6114
04:12:37.371 --> 04:12:38.787
and you feel what she's feeling,

6115
04:12:38.787 --> 04:12:43.180
it's like inconsistent. (vibration)

6116
04:12:44.410 --> 04:12:45.830
MARISHA: Like a heartbeat.

6117
04:12:45.830 --> 04:12:49.872
MATT: But it's jagged and--
SAM: Arrhythmic.

6118
04:12:49.872 --> 04:12:51.010
MATT: Then you feel for a second

6119
04:12:51.010 --> 04:12:53.330
and there is a rhythm to it,

6120
04:12:53.330 --> 04:12:58.310
like seven or so consistent types of vibration.

6121
04:12:58.310 --> 04:13:00.450
ASHLEY: How many are there again?
TRAVIS: Repeating?

6122
04:13:00.450 --> 04:13:02.000
MATT: There are a little over a dozen.

6123
04:13:02.000 --> 04:13:03.519
There's going to be 14 statues in here.

6124
04:13:03.519 --> 04:13:06.181
SAM: They're repeating patterns?

6125
04:13:06.181 --> 04:13:08.016
TALIESIN: Are the statues different at all?

6126
04:13:08.016 --> 04:13:09.870
MATT: No, they're all--
TALIESIN: Just the same.

6127
04:13:09.870 --> 04:13:11.536
MATT: They're all the same.
LIAM: This door, this gate--

6128
04:13:11.536 --> 04:13:13.120
TALIESIN: Not even a slight difference?

6129
04:13:13.120 --> 04:13:15.870
LIAM: -- Is connected to these dead--
MATT: Make a perception check.

6130
04:13:15.870 --> 04:13:17.770
LIAM: -- celestials, it makes me nervous

6131
04:13:17.770 --> 04:13:19.893
about his fascination with you.

6132
04:13:21.366 --> 04:13:22.762
TALIESIN: 19.
MATT: 19.

6133
04:13:22.762 --> 04:13:25.471
They all appear pretty identical.

6134
04:13:25.471 --> 04:13:26.304
MARISHA: Does there appear to be a

6135
04:13:26.304 --> 04:13:28.154
mechanism attached to the door,

6136
04:13:29.750 --> 04:13:32.320
lifting it up?
MATT: From what you can tell--

6137
04:13:32.320 --> 04:13:33.620
Make an investigation check

6138
04:13:33.620 --> 04:13:35.208
as you approach the door and check.

6139
04:13:35.208 --> 04:13:37.790
LAURA: Is the door opening at all, like minimally?

6140
04:13:37.790 --> 04:13:39.218
MATT: We'll find out with this investigation check.

6141
04:13:39.218 --> 04:13:40.051
LIAM: It was two feet up.

6142
04:13:40.051 --> 04:13:41.862
MARISHA: My god, that was almost a natural 20.

6143
04:13:41.862 --> 04:13:43.303
ASHLEY: What they're looking at?

6144
04:13:43.303 --> 04:13:45.789
LIAM: I thought the door was raised.

6145
04:13:45.789 --> 04:13:47.114
MATT: It's raised about a foot and a half.

6146
04:13:47.114 --> 04:13:49.850
LAURA: Yeah, I want to know if it's coming up at all,

6147
04:13:49.850 --> 04:13:53.589
like millimeters, if it's still raising. Yeah.

6148
04:13:53.589 --> 04:13:55.887
MARISHA: Ten.
MATT: Ten.

6149
04:13:55.887 --> 04:13:57.747
Looking up at the door,

6150
04:13:57.747 --> 04:13:59.370
you don't see any mechanism for it,

6151
04:13:59.370 --> 04:14:01.270
but you do see there's a tiny,

6152
04:14:01.270 --> 04:14:04.755
yellow gem that is affixed to the door.

6153
04:14:05.719 --> 04:14:08.447
SAM: The actual door, not above it?

6154
04:14:08.447 --> 04:14:09.350
MATT: To the door, and you can see

6155
04:14:09.350 --> 04:14:11.250
a loose chain that dangles from it.

6156
04:14:11.250 --> 04:14:13.460
TRAVIS: Nott, could you tell if there's any footprints

6157
04:14:13.460 --> 04:14:14.910
in front of that little tiny door

6158
04:14:14.910 --> 04:14:18.380
just in case that fucker's invisible and in here with us?

6159
04:14:18.380 --> 04:14:20.070
TALIESIN: Is that giving off-- I felt the magic.

6160
04:14:20.070 --> 04:14:21.090
I would have the Detect Magic--

6161
04:14:21.090 --> 04:14:23.294
MATT: You walk up to the door as well?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

6162
04:14:23.294 --> 04:14:25.450
MATT: There is a magical essence coming from that as well.

6163
04:14:25.450 --> 04:14:26.870
TALIESIN: From the chain and the gem, or just the gem?

6164
04:14:26.870 --> 04:14:27.995
MATT: Just the gem.

6165
04:14:27.995 --> 04:14:29.718
SAM: All right, I'll inspect to see

6166
04:14:29.718 --> 04:14:32.720
if there's any footprints or crawl marks

6167
04:14:32.720 --> 04:14:34.320
that go into the doorway.

6168
04:14:34.320 --> 04:14:36.020
MATT: Okay, make an investigation check.

6169
04:14:36.020 --> 04:14:37.450
TALIESIN: I look down there, too.

6170
04:14:37.450 --> 04:14:39.100
SAM: All right, 24.
MATT: 24.

6171
04:14:39.100 --> 04:14:44.100
You do see signs of limbs dragging

6172
04:14:44.250 --> 04:14:46.870
through and underneath, pushing the dust aside.

6173
04:14:46.870 --> 04:14:50.180
TALIESIN: I stare down underneath the door,

6174
04:14:50.180 --> 04:14:52.410
see if I can get anything with the Detect Magic

6175
04:14:52.410 --> 04:14:56.563
for the next 60 feet.
MATT: Nothing from the door, no.

6176
04:14:56.563 --> 04:14:57.740
TRAVIS: We got to get going here.

6177
04:14:59.700 --> 04:15:01.050
Yasha, you're in the middle.

6178
04:15:01.050 --> 04:15:02.160
MATT: Just then, (vibrating)

6179
04:15:02.160 --> 04:15:05.110
still holding your hand to that weird--

6180
04:15:06.450 --> 04:15:08.407
SAM: Is it like music?

6181
04:15:09.560 --> 04:15:10.701
MATT: I don't know.

6182
04:15:10.701 --> 04:15:11.726
MARISHA: Yasha.

6183
04:15:11.726 --> 04:15:14.760
I'm going to go put my hand on the one adjacent

6184
04:15:14.760 --> 04:15:16.470
to this one that you're touching.

6185
04:15:16.470 --> 04:15:18.310
Let's see if it's the same rhythm.

6186
04:15:18.310 --> 04:15:19.861
ASHLEY: Okay.

6187
04:15:19.861 --> 04:15:21.600
SAM: Why don't you guys hum out what you hear?

6188
04:15:21.600 --> 04:15:22.720
MARISHA: Okay.

6189
04:15:22.720 --> 04:15:25.462
MATT: Okay, you both feel it.

6190
04:15:25.462 --> 04:15:27.450
You both look at each other,

6191
04:15:27.450 --> 04:15:29.910
find a way to find a pattern, and it's identical.

6192
04:15:29.910 --> 04:15:32.030
MARISHA: Buzz, buzz, buzz.
ASHLEY: Buzz, Buzz.

6193
04:15:32.030 --> 04:15:33.880
MATT: Identical pattern, yeah.
MARISHA: It's identical?

6194
04:15:33.880 --> 04:15:37.505
ASHLEY: It's identical.
(laughter)

6195
04:15:37.505 --> 04:15:39.080
LAURA: I'm going to put my ear to one of the statues.

6196
04:15:39.080 --> 04:15:40.888
MATT: Okay, you listen to it,

6197
04:15:40.888 --> 04:15:45.888
and you hear this faint, almost an oboe-like music track

6198
04:15:46.030 --> 04:15:48.775
playing these notes repeatedly.

6199
04:15:48.775 --> 04:15:53.775
[Vocalizing Melody]

6200
04:15:55.450 --> 04:15:57.400
LAURA: Does it sound sad or does it sound--

6201
04:15:59.630 --> 04:16:00.463
MATT: It...

6202
04:16:02.163 --> 04:16:05.588
doesn't sound sad or happy.

6203
04:16:05.588 --> 04:16:08.940
It just sounds like music.

6204
04:16:08.940 --> 04:16:10.260
TALIESIN: Someone's working very hard

6205
04:16:10.260 --> 04:16:11.980
to keep something inside this.

6206
04:16:11.980 --> 04:16:13.770
MARISHA: Let lie the king's instrument.

6207
04:16:13.770 --> 04:16:14.822
SAM: Uh-huh.

6208
04:16:14.822 --> 04:16:17.590
LAURA: Oh my god, it is a metal harp!

6209
04:16:17.590 --> 04:16:19.090
MARISHA: It is a metal harp!

6210
04:16:19.090 --> 04:16:21.170
SAM: It's a fucking metal harp.

6211
04:16:21.170 --> 04:16:24.756
TRAVIS: Are the statues stone?
SAM: How did you guys know?

6212
04:16:24.756 --> 04:16:25.820
MATT: They appear to be stone,

6213
04:16:25.820 --> 04:16:27.243
like a smooth alabaster.

6214
04:16:28.447 --> 04:16:29.280
ASHLEY: I'm going to try something.

6215
04:16:29.280 --> 04:16:33.440
It may be dumb, but I'm going to

6216
04:16:33.440 --> 04:16:38.173
maybe because of being

6217
04:16:38.173 --> 04:16:39.006
celestial,

6218
04:16:39.006 --> 04:16:40.880
I'm going to stand by that door

6219
04:16:40.880 --> 04:16:42.740
and just look at that thing,

6220
04:16:42.740 --> 04:16:46.297
and see if maybe it'll be like, "Oh, hey, we'll let you in."

6221
04:16:46.297 --> 04:16:48.020
MATT: (laughs) All right, you approach

6222
04:16:48.020 --> 04:16:51.346
and stand before the door, look it over,

6223
04:16:51.346 --> 04:16:53.997
look at the gem that Beau pointed out.

6224
04:16:56.558 --> 04:16:57.730
Nothing.

6225
04:16:57.730 --> 04:17:01.770
LAURA: I sing out loud the song, that oboe I hear.

6226
04:17:01.770 --> 04:17:02.603
MATT: Okay.

6227
04:17:04.330 --> 04:17:05.421
No reaction.

6228
04:17:07.210 --> 04:17:08.583
You're standing amongst a bunch

6229
04:17:08.583 --> 04:17:10.060
of angel bones and angel skulls.

6230
04:17:10.060 --> 04:17:12.271
LIAM: We are going to go in there.
LAURA: Yeah.

6231
04:17:12.271 --> 04:17:13.937
LIAM: Are we walking in?

6232
04:17:13.937 --> 04:17:15.245
MARISHA: Can we all fit under?

6233
04:17:15.245 --> 04:17:16.963
MATT: You could probably crawl through.

6234
04:17:18.820 --> 04:17:19.720
TALIESIN: I don't like it.

6235
04:17:21.140 --> 04:17:25.650
TRAVIS: Frumpkin, Beau, me, Yasha,

6236
04:17:25.650 --> 04:17:28.907
people in for back support.

6237
04:17:28.907 --> 04:17:31.040
Cleric in the front, Cleric in the back.

6238
04:17:31.980 --> 04:17:35.207
LIAM: Just give me 30 seconds to take an initial peek.

6239
04:17:36.410 --> 04:17:39.120
The globules float outside of the door,

6240
04:17:39.120 --> 04:17:41.460
so hopefully a little bit spills in

6241
04:17:41.460 --> 04:17:43.650
and Frumpkin just pip, pip, pip, pip

6242
04:17:43.650 --> 04:17:47.912
walks in four feet past the gap.

6243
04:17:48.904 --> 04:17:50.374
And I'm looking.

6244
04:17:51.291 --> 04:17:54.437
MATT: Frumpkin moves beyond the doorway

6245
04:17:55.350 --> 04:17:58.883
and passes immediately into

6246
04:17:58.883 --> 04:18:03.883
an interior room, about 80 by 60 feet.

6247
04:18:04.200 --> 04:18:06.250
Best that you can see, lightless.

6248
04:18:06.250 --> 04:18:08.520
There's a few pillars that Frumpkin can see.

6249
04:18:08.520 --> 04:18:09.720
Make a perception check,

6250
04:18:10.764 --> 04:18:13.340
with disadvantage because there is no light in here.

6251
04:18:16.620 --> 04:18:18.417
LIAM: Perception? 14.

6252
04:18:18.417 --> 04:18:19.250
SAM: Hey.

6253
04:18:19.250 --> 04:18:20.903
MATT: 14?

6254
04:18:20.903 --> 04:18:24.340
Frumpkin can just barely make out three pillars.

6255
04:18:24.340 --> 04:18:25.780
There appears to be a collapsed

6256
04:18:25.780 --> 04:18:27.050
corner on the right side

6257
04:18:28.780 --> 04:18:31.010
where some stones and bits of rock

6258
04:18:31.010 --> 04:18:33.160
and parts of the wall have fallen in.

6259
04:18:35.433 --> 04:18:39.331
That's all that Frumpkin can see from four feet in, yeah.

6260
04:18:39.331 --> 04:18:43.703
LIAM: Does he smell anything odd?

6261
04:18:43.703 --> 04:18:45.575
MATT: With that, there is an odd smell.

6262
04:18:45.575 --> 04:18:47.950
LIAM: Advantage for smell.
MATT: Yeah.

6263
04:18:47.950 --> 04:18:51.810
It smells a bit earthy,

6264
04:18:52.793 --> 04:18:56.001
but also like a--

6265
04:18:57.960 --> 04:19:01.270
like a faint bit of rot mixed with sulfur?

6266
04:19:01.270 --> 04:19:02.403
It's hard.

6267
04:19:02.403 --> 04:19:05.500
There's like a mingling of different minerals

6268
04:19:05.500 --> 04:19:09.080
that's alien to Frumpkin's nose.

6269
04:19:09.080 --> 04:19:11.250
It's not super strong, but it's just faint

6270
04:19:11.250 --> 04:19:14.151
and generally relegated around the floor.

6271
04:19:14.151 --> 04:19:16.700
LIAM: Okay, so it's very dark in there.

6272
04:19:16.700 --> 04:19:19.220
I could send in the globules

6273
04:19:19.220 --> 04:19:23.135
to light up the room, or we could go in.

6274
04:19:24.460 --> 04:19:25.926
LAURA: Let's go in.

6275
04:19:27.290 --> 04:19:29.854
TRAVIS: How often can you be invisible, Nott?

6276
04:19:29.854 --> 04:19:31.451
SAM: I'm still invisible.

6277
04:19:32.551 --> 04:19:35.485
Another half hour or so, I assume.

6278
04:19:37.024 --> 04:19:39.267
TRAVIS: I'd rather do that than light it up,

6279
04:19:39.267 --> 04:19:40.976
but that's just me.

6280
04:19:40.976 --> 04:19:43.020
LAURA: Oh, you can already see in the dark, yeah?

6281
04:19:43.020 --> 04:19:44.965
SAM: Mm-hmm.
LAURA: Okay.

6282
04:19:46.518 --> 04:19:48.872
MARISHA: Yasha.
ASHLEY: Yeah?

6283
04:19:49.736 --> 04:19:52.520
MARISHA: I get nervous that you're some sort

6284
04:19:52.520 --> 04:19:55.660
of key to Obann's final plan.

6285
04:19:58.363 --> 04:20:02.027
It seems like some celestial presence

6286
04:20:02.027 --> 04:20:05.250
worked really hard to lock away something really bad,

6287
04:20:07.097 --> 04:20:12.088
and this guy's interest in you, I don't know.

6288
04:20:13.246 --> 04:20:16.730
I think we might be walking the key master

6289
04:20:16.730 --> 04:20:18.422
in to the gatekeeper.

6290
04:20:20.260 --> 04:20:24.418
ASHLEY: Well, if that's

6291
04:20:25.776 --> 04:20:27.709
the case, then--

6292
04:20:30.610 --> 04:20:32.643
MARISHA: We'll protect you at all costs.

6293
04:20:33.600 --> 04:20:36.620
ASHLEY: I know that, but if it goes awry

6294
04:20:37.580 --> 04:20:40.480
and they do end up taking me, you guys know what to do.

6295
04:20:40.480 --> 04:20:41.313
TRAVIS: We do.

6296
04:20:41.313 --> 04:20:43.070
He was always surprised to see you.

6297
04:20:43.070 --> 04:20:45.732
I don't think this was part of his plan.

6298
04:20:45.732 --> 04:20:47.635
He was going to do what he was going to do anyway.

6299
04:20:47.635 --> 04:20:49.373
ASHLEY: I think you're right.

6300
04:20:50.410 --> 04:20:51.435
LIAM: While they're talking,

6301
04:20:51.435 --> 04:20:54.609
I place my hand on Caduceus' wrist

6302
04:20:54.609 --> 04:20:59.609
and spend a minute giving him the Gift of Alacrity as well.

6303
04:21:00.290 --> 04:21:01.123
MATT: Okay.

6304
04:21:01.123 --> 04:21:02.885
TALIESIN: What does that do?

6305
04:21:02.885 --> 04:21:05.107
LIAM: 1d8 added to your initiative.

6306
04:21:05.107 --> 04:21:05.940
TALIESIN: All right.

6307
04:21:05.940 --> 04:21:07.130
SAM: Caduceus!

6308
04:21:07.130 --> 04:21:09.991
Ah, wait, you can't.
TALIESIN: What?

6309
04:21:09.991 --> 04:21:11.830
SAM: Fjord, you're pretty tall, right?

6310
04:21:11.830 --> 04:21:12.663
TRAVIS: Yeah.

6311
04:21:12.663 --> 04:21:14.883
SAM: Why don't you look like Yasha?

6312
04:21:14.883 --> 04:21:16.510
TRAVIS: All right.
TALIESIN: I can do that.

6313
04:21:16.510 --> 04:21:17.900
SAM: You can do that?
TALIESIN: 'Course I can do that.

6314
04:21:17.900 --> 04:21:22.851
LAURA: Yeah, but he can sound like her.

6315
04:21:22.851 --> 04:21:24.192
SAM: How about you do it, too?

6316
04:21:24.192 --> 04:21:27.150
TALIESIN: I mean for a while, yeah.

6317
04:21:27.150 --> 04:21:29.426
LIAM: I can do it to all of us if we all wanted to.

6318
04:21:29.426 --> 04:21:31.322
SAM: But they're tall.

6319
04:21:31.322 --> 04:21:32.650
TRAVIS: Yeah, now there's three Yashas

6320
04:21:32.650 --> 04:21:34.240
and two of us sound like we've been

6321
04:21:34.240 --> 04:21:36.015
at a ska concert all night.

6322
04:21:36.015 --> 04:21:39.187
(laughter)

6323
04:21:39.187 --> 04:21:41.395
TALIESIN: It'll be pretty obvious once the fight starts,

6324
04:21:41.395 --> 04:21:42.228
but yeah.

6325
04:21:42.228 --> 04:21:45.990
ASHLEY: Well, to be fair, he doesn't know my voice, I think.

6326
04:21:45.990 --> 04:21:48.720
LAURA: Just lower yours, too, so you sound closer to Fjord.

6327
04:21:49.953 --> 04:21:51.150
SAM: Can you sound like Fjord?

6328
04:21:52.390 --> 04:21:54.430
ASHLEY: (low Texan accent) Well, hell.

6329
04:21:54.430 --> 04:21:57.643
TRAVIS: (stilted) Well, hell.
LIAM: (stilted) Eh-oh-eh-oh.

6330
04:21:57.643 --> 04:21:59.580
ASHLEY: Eh-oh-eh-oh.

6331
04:21:59.580 --> 04:22:02.340
SAM: Caduceus, how's your Fjord voice?

6332
04:22:03.370 --> 04:22:05.450
TALIESIN: (as Caduceus) Well, hell.

6333
04:22:05.450 --> 04:22:08.912
Yeah, I think we, we have a similar timbre.

6334
04:22:11.300 --> 04:22:12.850
SAM: All right, what are we doing?

6335
04:22:14.280 --> 04:22:15.900
Want me to go in?

6336
04:22:15.900 --> 04:22:17.843
All right, Fjord, give me the flask.

6337
04:22:17.843 --> 04:22:19.093
TRAVIS: The flask?

6338
04:22:19.093 --> 04:22:21.593
SAM: The flask that you stole. My flask! I know you did it.

6339
04:22:24.425 --> 04:22:25.941
TRAVIS: I don't have it.

6340
04:22:25.941 --> 04:22:27.649
SAM: You fucker.

6341
04:22:28.827 --> 04:22:31.000
I'll fucking kill you.

6342
04:22:31.000 --> 04:22:31.833
Sorry.

6343
04:22:31.833 --> 04:22:34.470
I'm really just distracted right now.

6344
04:22:34.470 --> 04:22:36.570
TRAVIS: Well, I understand.

6345
04:22:36.570 --> 04:22:37.403
SAM: You're dead.

6346
04:22:37.403 --> 04:22:40.983
All right, I'm going in.
(laughter)

6347
04:22:40.983 --> 04:22:42.290
MATT: All right.

6348
04:22:42.290 --> 04:22:45.740
You all stand behind the door.

6349
04:22:45.740 --> 04:22:47.340
MARISHA: Oh my god.

6350
04:22:47.340 --> 04:22:51.990
MATT: Surrounded by errant scraps

6351
04:22:51.990 --> 04:22:52.823
and bones

6352
04:22:52.823 --> 04:22:57.230
and angel skulls amongst statues faced,

6353
04:22:58.790 --> 04:23:03.790
as Nott climbs low beneath the adamantine door

6354
04:23:04.610 --> 04:23:07.725
and onward to the chamber within.

6355
04:23:07.725 --> 04:23:10.834
And that's where we'll pick up next week.
TRAVIS: No! Come on, man!

6356
04:23:10.834 --> 04:23:12.201
MARISHA: There it is.

6357
04:23:12.201 --> 04:23:14.521
TALIESIN: (rock guitar)

6358
04:23:14.521 --> 04:23:16.670
LAURA: Oh my god.

6359
04:23:17.656 --> 04:23:21.150
TALIESIN: This is fine.
LAURA: This is fucking creepy.

6360
04:23:21.150 --> 04:23:23.170
SAM: Bleeding eyes on statues?

6361
04:23:23.170 --> 04:23:24.620
LAURA: Angel statues?

6362
04:23:24.620 --> 04:23:26.030
Creepy as balls.

6363
04:23:26.030 --> 04:23:29.200
TRAVIS: Bro. Yes. Fuck yes.
MARISHA: Rock harpist!

6364
04:23:29.200 --> 04:23:31.977
TRAVIS: I don't know what the fuck you're building, but yes.

6365
04:23:31.977 --> 04:23:35.842
LIAM: (sings intro to Immigrant Song)

6366
04:23:35.842 --> 04:23:38.017
TRAVIS: You sick fuck.

6367
04:23:38.017 --> 04:23:38.930
MATT: This is fun.

6368
04:23:38.930 --> 04:23:40.560
ASHLEY: What's he building in there?

6369
04:23:40.560 --> 04:23:41.940
MARISHA: Maybe they call you Orphan Maker

6370
04:23:41.940 --> 04:23:45.380
because you had a ton of groupies,

6371
04:23:45.380 --> 04:23:49.638
and you just made a ton of offspring everywhere you went.

6372
04:23:49.638 --> 04:23:51.496
ASHLEY: Had a bunch of kids I didn't know about.

6373
04:23:51.496 --> 04:23:53.250
TALIESIN: I was thinking they call you Orphan Maker

6374
04:23:53.250 --> 04:23:54.530
because when drunk you claimed

6375
04:23:54.530 --> 04:23:56.467
to have written the musical of Annie.

6376
04:23:56.467 --> 04:23:58.520
(laughter)

6377
04:23:58.520 --> 04:23:59.970
The Orphan Maker!

6378
04:23:59.970 --> 04:24:02.201
The sun come out yet? Ha ha ha ha!

6379
04:24:02.201 --> 04:24:04.460
LIAM: Fitting for Ashley Johnson.
MATT: So many layers.

6380
04:24:04.460 --> 04:24:05.517
ASHLEY: Yes!

6381
04:24:07.076 --> 04:24:08.838
♪ The sun'll come out ♪

6382
04:24:08.838 --> 04:24:11.525
(laughter)

6383
04:24:11.525 --> 04:24:13.035
LAURA: Ah, dreams come true.

6384
04:24:13.035 --> 04:24:14.430
They really, really do.
MATT: Oh, I love it.

6385
04:24:14.430 --> 04:24:17.210
All right, we'll pick up from there next week.

6386
04:24:17.210 --> 04:24:19.400
LIAM: Maybe you killed a lot of kids' parents.

6387
04:24:19.400 --> 04:24:20.360
ASHLEY: Maybe.
TALIESIN: Maybe.

6388
04:24:20.360 --> 04:24:22.080
MARISHA: Or you fucked a lot of people.

6389
04:24:22.080 --> 04:24:23.000
SAM: Oh, god!
LAURA: Woo!

6390
04:24:23.000 --> 04:24:24.100
ASHLEY: Or both.

6391
04:24:24.100 --> 04:24:26.964
LIAM: That technically doesn't make orphans.

6392
04:24:26.964 --> 04:24:28.510
MATT: Technically.
TALIESIN: Yeah. Technically.

6393
04:24:28.510 --> 04:24:30.293
MATT: (as Jester) Technically.

6394
04:24:30.293 --> 04:24:31.930
LAURA: (as Jester) Technically.
MARISHA: Semantics.

6395
04:24:31.930 --> 04:24:33.670
MATT: Unless you very strongly convince them

6396
04:24:33.670 --> 04:24:35.504
each time that you were killed,

6397
04:24:35.504 --> 04:24:36.550
and they assume they're an orphan.

6398
04:24:36.550 --> 04:24:37.912
LIAM: You convince the other party

6399
04:24:37.912 --> 04:24:39.517
to leave that child as well.

6400
04:24:39.517 --> 04:24:41.767
MATT: That's true. All right then.

6401
04:24:41.767 --> 04:24:43.720
We'll pick this up next week.

6402
04:24:43.720 --> 04:24:45.200
Have a wonderful week, everyone.

6403
04:24:45.200 --> 04:24:48.146
We love you very much, and is it Thursday yet?

6404
04:24:48.146 --> 04:24:49.712
LIAM: No!
ASHLEY: No!

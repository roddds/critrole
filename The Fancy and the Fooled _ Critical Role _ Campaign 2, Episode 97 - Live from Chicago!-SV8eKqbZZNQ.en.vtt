00:00:27.068 --> 00:00:31.730
BRIAN: Uh-oh, that's a little, oh boy, okay.

3
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.160
Thank you all For showing up.

4
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.830
That's too many people, sorry.

5
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.460
No, thank you so much for waiting outside in the cold,

6
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.337
everybody, and for being so patient.

7
00:00:40.337 --> 00:00:41.703
[cheering]

8
00:00:41.703 --> 00:00:43.453
Thank you, seriously.

9
00:00:44.685 --> 00:00:47.040
We wanted to get as many of you in as possible,

10
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.610
so as always, thank you for being the best community

11
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.480
based on-- from a D&amp;D show,

12
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.063
from a home game, based on a thing with a--

13
00:00:58.867 --> 00:01:00.838
What do you guys think of this outfit?

14
00:01:00.838 --> 00:01:04.340
[cheering]

15
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.010
I look like-- yes, thank you, yeah.

16
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.406
I mean, it's expensive, but we can try it after the show.

17
00:01:10.406 --> 00:01:11.890
[laughter]

18
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.640
I feel like I look like that uncle

19
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.020
that says that he coaches kids' soccer,

20
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.375
but he actually just disposes of bodies in the lake.

21
00:01:19.375 --> 00:01:22.860
[laughter]

22
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.780
Or, what was it we're talking about earlier?

23
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.389
Oh, I look like a youth pastor on the first night of camp.

24
00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:31.322
[laughter]

25
00:01:31.322 --> 00:01:33.405
Do you guys ever do that?

26
00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.550
I used to do that.

27
00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.831
I guess what I'm saying is,

28
00:01:38.831 --> 00:01:39.664
guess what I'm saying is,

29
00:01:39.664 --> 00:01:41.620
if you see someone dressed like me

30
00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.620
in the audience tonight, call the fucking police at once.

31
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.710
Okay, so we have a couple of little ground rules to go over.

32
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.751
If you haven't been to a Critical Role live show before,

33
00:01:53.751 --> 00:01:55.095
welcome!

34
00:01:55.095 --> 00:01:56.169
It's fun.

35
00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:57.002
It's fun.

36
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.770
We want you to have a good experience tonight.

37
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.780
We want all the folks at home watching all around the world

38
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.160
to have a good experience and on YouTube later and all that.

39
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.330
So we ask a few things of you in attendance

40
00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.430
at this live show.

41
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.740
Please don't shout anything out to the players

42
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.980
or to each other during the show.

43
00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.610
A lot of people think it's cool to be like,

44
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.398
"You forgot Hunter's Mark!" from the 39th row.

45
00:02:25.398 --> 00:02:29.850
I'm not going to have any of that shit tonight.

46
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.850
Let them make their own mistakes.

47
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.040
That's my favorite part of the show.

48
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.890
No need to correct anyone.

49
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.970
Also, don't yell out anything you think might be funny.

50
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.400
Take it from someone who knows,

51
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.408
there's nothing worse than bombing in front of

52
00:02:45.408 --> 00:02:48.641
3,875 people.

53
00:02:48.641 --> 00:02:51.620
The only thing that you should yell during the show

54
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.380
besides if there's a natural 20 or a natural one,

55
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.050
or something that's actually, you know, happening

56
00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.350
is if there's a fire, you are welcome to yell.

57
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.730
We just ask that you yell the word "Fire,"

58
00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.787
or maybe "actual fire," yell "actual fire."

59
00:03:08.787 --> 00:03:10.862
[laughter]

60
00:03:10.862 --> 00:03:13.200
That way we know it's an actual fucking fire

61
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.444
and we don't end up with another Caleb's family situation.

62
00:03:16.444 --> 00:03:17.277
[dismayed groaning]

63
00:03:17.277 --> 00:03:21.519
On our hands.

64
00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.769
(laughs)

65
00:03:29.435 --> 00:03:31.240
You guys don't understand.

66
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.610
If a room is 50% laughs and 50% groans,

67
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.652
Taliesin adds five years to my life.

68
00:03:38.652 --> 00:03:40.155
[cheering]

69
00:03:40.155 --> 00:03:42.196
(laughs)

70
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.290
There's a reason they had me stand this far back, too.

71
00:03:49.483 --> 00:03:50.449
There is going to be a break.

72
00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:52.930
So we do ask that you try to keep your sitting

73
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.170
and standing up to a minimum.

74
00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.396
We don't want to block anyone's
view of Sam's hot pink crotch.

75
00:03:58.396 --> 00:04:00.550
[laughter]

76
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.350
Which is why you're all here this evening.

77
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.410
And last, but most important,

78
00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.727
don't forget to love each other.

79
00:04:08.727 --> 00:04:11.727
[cheering]

80
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.350
I know that they're serving booze to you filthy animals,

81
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.133
and (laughs)--

82
00:04:19.133 --> 00:04:21.160
I just want to say please be respectful

83
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.590
of the Critters around you,

84
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.270
especially if they're in cosplay.

85
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.230
That can be kind of tricky.

86
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.880
Just be careful when you're getting up and be respectful.

87
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.310
Don't be the drunk guy who says shit and gets in a fight.

88
00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.143
Let me do that.

89
00:04:32.143 --> 00:04:34.800
It's my favorite part of coming to these things.

90
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.320
And yeah, don't be an asshole is the bottom line.

91
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.153
That's my job.

92
00:04:38.153 --> 00:04:41.670
So without further ado.

93
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.670

94

Where a--

Where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

00:07:37.883 --> 00:07:39.516
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

Oh, there are the nerves.

159
00:07:57.810 --> 00:07:58.643
Thank you guys so much for joining us.

160
00:07:58.643 --> 00:08:00.690
Thank you all for being so patient.

161
00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:02.080
We've had some challenges tonight.

162
00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.000
A lot of you were out there in the cold for a long time.

163
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.280
So sorry, we're really appreciative of your patience.

164
00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.940
It's much warmer in here.

165
00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:09.648
So welcome, and

166
00:08:09.648 --> 00:08:13.387
I guess that's what we get for defying
an archfey's wishes of avoiding the theater.

170
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:22.940
But so before we get into tonight's session,

171
00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:25.540
we do have some announcements to get through,

172
00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:28.380
beginning first and foremost with the first

173
00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:29.370
of our two sponsors tonight,

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:33.410
our friends at World Anvil. Sam.

to homebrew worlds for your adventures.

184
00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:01.130
So grab some cabbage, Guinness,

185
00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:04.680
and boil a potato because World Anvil allows

186
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:08.400
storytellers to create interactive maps by dropping pins

187
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.070
to keep track of the locations in your world.

188
00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:13.570
And you'll dance a jig while your craft timelines

189
00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:17.488

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:27.955

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:16.878
Laura, you have an announcement?

241
00:11:16.878 --> 00:11:18.436
LAURA: Oh, hi.

242
00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.286
Yeah, so there's no merch here tonight,

243
00:11:22.286 --> 00:11:24.344
but guess what, you guys,

244
00:11:24.344 --> 00:11:26.335
there's merch at C2E2,

there will not be a Wyrmwood sweepstakes tonight

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:55.070
during the break, so don't wait for it,

Welcome back.

306
00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:20.570
So as we last left off,

307
00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:22.240
The Mighty Nein had made their way down

308
00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.450
to the Whitedawn Lagoon in search of the whereabouts

309
00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:26.450
of Caduceus Clay's family.

310
00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:29.740
Who had long, one-by-one, vanished over time

311
00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:33.070
in search of this familial task that was put upon them

312
00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:36.913
by their patron deity, the Wild Mother.

313
00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.890
Upon discovering the family and many others turned to stone

314
00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:44.070
by some sort of a Miskath mutation of a gorgon,

315
00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:48.250
you managed to save most of the people who are necessary.

316
00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:51.230
And then through a clever use of magic,

317
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:53.020
and really high medicine rolls,

318
00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:54.280
did save the one who got shattered

319
00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.196
in the middle of the battle,

320
00:14:56.196 --> 00:14:58.750
[cheering]

321
00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:00.550
completed what seems to be the final leg

322
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:01.860
of this vision quest,

323
00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:06.160
and sent to the now safe family of Caduceus Clay back

324
00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.280
to their home at the Blooming Grove.

325
00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:12.690
You guys then made your way to Nicodranas to go ahead

326
00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:14.990
and figure out how to prepare yourselves

327
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:19.110
for the coming negotiation between the Kryn Dynasty

328
00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:22.600
and the Dwendalian Empire during the ceasefire,

329
00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.801
of which you were told you don't need to be there,

330
00:15:25.801 --> 00:15:27.490
[laughter]

331
00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:29.262
but you insisted regardless.

00:15:29.262 --> 00:15:31.040
[laughter]

333
00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:35.140
And as such, you've teleported

334
00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:37.115
without forewarning

335
00:15:37.115 --> 00:15:41.860
into the Tidepeak Tower of Yussa in Nicodranas.

336
00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:44.007
And that's where we left off last.

337
00:15:44.007 --> 00:15:49.007
So as you guys all arrive into the darkened chamber,

338
00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:53.250
the inside of the Yussa's tower, what would you like to do?

00:15:54.766 --> 00:15:55.974

356
00:16:24.435 --> 00:16:26.505
And the goblin rushes off, and leads you guys down

357
00:16:26.505 --> 00:16:29.420
the spiral staircase.
LAURA: See, we don't need to let them know,

358

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:35.990
MATT: All right, make your way down
to the base of the tower.

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:39.200

362
00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.290
And you can see the sunlight now pouring through

363
00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:43.320
from the exterior of the midday,

364
00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:46.220
bright, coastal city of Nicodranas.

365
00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:49.754
The smell of sea spray and

366
00:16:49.754 --> 00:16:53.960
various coastal breezes pouring through.

367
00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:57.220
You can hear the sound of gulls off in the distance

368
00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:58.300
and the day is yours.

369
00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:00.467
What would you like to do?

370
00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:05.780
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (yelling) I love you, Taliesin!

371
00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:07.788
MATT: That's sweet, but remember what Brian said.

372
00:17:07.788 --> 00:17:10.868
(laughter)

373
00:17:10.868 --> 00:17:13.290
TALIESIN: I suppose we should go check on the ship unless,

374
00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:15.360
or I suppose you want to say hi to your mom?

375
00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:16.820
LAURA: Well, always, yes, but,

376
00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:20.490
yeah, we should check on the ship too.

377
00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:22.910
LIAM: Yeah, why don't we start at the ship,

378
00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:25.330
see what we are doing, when we can depart,

379
00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:27.430
and then finish up any business

380
00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:28.780
we have in here in town.

381
00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:29.613
LAURA: Yeah.

382
00:17:29.613 --> 00:17:30.560
LIAM: Okay.

383
00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:31.410
TRAVIS: Should we start at the ship

384
00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:33.490
and then head to your mother's?

385
00:17:33.490 --> 00:17:34.323
LAURA: Sure.

386
00:17:34.323 --> 00:17:35.156
TRAVIS: All right.

387
00:17:35.156 --> 00:17:36.010
LAURA: That way you can see your family.

388
00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:40.040
SAM: Yes, yes, we should.

389
00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:42.523
LIAM: Oddly comforting to be back here.

390
00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:45.570
MARISHA: You okay, Nott?

391
00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:48.600
SAM: I mean, I'm okay, yeah.

392
00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.320
We're near the water,

393
00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:53.698
so that's real fun.

394
00:17:53.698 --> 00:17:55.831
MARISHA: I was thinking-- I was--

395
00:17:55.831 --> 00:17:57.820
I thought it was way deeper, I'm sorry.

396
00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:02.200
SAM: No, no, you're not wrong. I, um,

397
00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.820
I've been doing a lot of thinking

398
00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:07.570
and I sort of promised Yeza that

399
00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:12.120
the next time I saw him it wouldn't be like this, so.

400
00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:12.953
LAURA: Oh.

401
00:18:15.303 --> 00:18:17.430
Do you want do the spell

402
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:19.290
before we go see your family?

403
00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:21.400
LIAM: Yeah, you set the timetable on that.

404
00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.930
We could do it on the ship.

405
00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:26.320
SAM: I've been doing some meditating, you know.

406
00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:27.835
TALIESIN: Wow!

407
00:18:27.835 --> 00:18:29.843
[laughter]

408
00:18:29.843 --> 00:18:33.130
SAM: I mean, it's not <i>that</i> surprising, but sure.

409
00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:35.120
TALIESIN: I just assumed that you meant drinking by that.

410
00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.390
But either way, okay.

411
00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:38.990
SAM: No, I've been thinking about it

412
00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:41.470
and most of the time when I meditate,

413
00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:45.800
I just fall asleep, it's really just napping.

414
00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:47.060
MARISHA: Kind of.

415
00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:49.500
SAM: But I like napping a great deal.

416
00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:52.030
MARISHA: You can find, like, a lucid state

417
00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:54.640
where you're just letting your brain wander.

418
00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:57.960
SAM: I'll take your word for it.

419
00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:02.960
But in some of my naps, I've had good dreams.

420
00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:06.881
And in the last one I had a really nice dream

421
00:19:06.881 --> 00:19:09.572
about Luc and Yeza

422
00:19:09.572 --> 00:19:11.740
and I was with them,

423
00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:14.070
and it was just nice, so--

424
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:16.487
LAURA: You were with them as Veth?

425
00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:19.350
SAM: Yeah.

426
00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:22.116
So I'm thinking--

427
00:19:22.116 --> 00:19:24.557
I had a nap vision, and--

428
00:19:24.557 --> 00:19:26.376
[laughter]

429
00:19:26.376 --> 00:19:28.059
it's time.

430
00:19:29.414 --> 00:19:32.712
[cheering]

431
00:19:32.712 --> 00:19:34.830
TRAVIS: Can you just remind the rest of the group,

432
00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:36.310
not me, but the rest of the group,

433
00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:39.560
what the components might, again, that you need?

434
00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:40.430
SAM: We needed, well, you know--

435
00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:41.801
ASHLEY: Lots of clay.

436
00:19:41.801 --> 00:19:43.015
LAURA: And gem dust.

437
00:19:43.015 --> 00:19:44.740
MARISHA: Like, a fuck ton of clay.

438
00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:46.070
SAM: Do we do we have any gem?

439
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:47.580
TRAVIS: It was 50 pounds or something like that?

440
00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:49.030
SAM: It was 50 pounds of clay.

441
00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:52.730
MATT: One pound per pound of the actual person's body.

442
00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:54.730
MARISHA: How many gems?

443
00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:56.430
LAURA: Like, it was, like, 300.

444
00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:59.886
SAM: 300 gold worth of the gem dust.
MARISHA: That's not so bad.

445
00:19:59.886 --> 00:20:01.603
TRAVIS: I'm sure they have gems around here

446
00:20:01.603 --> 00:20:02.710
that we could purchase so that--

447
00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:05.040
MATT: He's the one that has the spell.
You'd have to ask him.

448
00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:09.408
LIAM: ♪ I am looking at up in my shit. ♪

449
00:20:09.408 --> 00:20:12.957
It's 150 gold worth of crushed gem dust.

450
00:20:12.957 --> 00:20:14.830
LAURA: Oh, even better.
LIAM: Yeah.

451
00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:18.405
SAM: It's cheap, really.
LAURA: I mean, that's next to nothing.

452
00:20:18.405 --> 00:20:20.258
We could all change our bodies if we want.

453
00:20:20.258 --> 00:20:22.185
[laughter]

454
00:20:22.185 --> 00:20:24.468
SAM: I could do it, like, every Thursday or something.

455
00:20:24.468 --> 00:20:26.420
[laughter]

456
00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:27.440
LAURA: Yeah.

457
00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.932
SAM: Like, oh, maybe this week I'll be a

458
00:20:29.932 --> 00:20:32.040
minotaur or something.

459
00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.180
LAURA: Ooh.

460
00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:35.120
MATT: Technically once the spell's been cast on you,

461
00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.330
it can't be cast on you for another year.

462
00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:37.480
LIAM: A year, yeah.

463
00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:38.620
LAURA: Oh.
SAM: It's worth trying.

464
00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:39.453
LIAM: Also.

465
00:20:39.453 --> 00:20:40.286
[laughter]

466
00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.710
Nott, you have a little something, right,

467
00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:44.580
like right here.

468
00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:47.330
SAM: Right here, did I get it?

469
00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:48.550
TALIESIN: No.
LIAM: Mostly.

470
00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:50.216
SAM: Okay.
LAURA: Yeah, it's fine.

471
00:20:50.216 --> 00:20:51.480
TRAVIS: I mean, if you did want to become a minotaur,

472
00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:53.240
you could always go back up to Xhorhas for like,

473
00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:54.900
I don't know, a year and just have a fling

474
00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:56.740
with old Captain Thunderballs.

475
00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:58.695
SAM: That sounds amazing.

476
00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:01.480
I mean--
LAURA: We would cover for you.

477
00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:05.484
SAM: He was a bull in all the right places.

478
00:21:05.484 --> 00:21:08.484
[cheering]

479
00:21:12.736 --> 00:21:14.527
Oof!

480
00:21:15.444 --> 00:21:17.094
As tempting as that sound,

481
00:21:17.094 --> 00:21:19.927
I need to listen to my nap vision,

482
00:21:21.778 --> 00:21:24.440
and I think it's time, but again,

483
00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.690
we can go check out the Balleater first

484
00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:30.720
and then I guess go a-diggin'.

485
00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:32.870
LAURA: Maybe we can get some gem dust

486
00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:33.703
on the way to the Balleater.

487
00:21:33.703 --> 00:21:34.790
SAM: All right, sure.

488
00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:37.630
LAURA: Because we're passing by some shops, I'm assuming.

489
00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:38.921
MATT: You know this town very well

490
00:21:38.921 --> 00:21:40.060
and there are jewelers

491
00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:43.830
and sellers of all sorts of beautiful gems,

492
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:46.320
both cut and uncut.

493
00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:47.280
So yeah, that can definitely be done,

494
00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:48.770
while you're perusing the town.

495
00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:51.040
TALIESIN: If there are rivers that lead into the ocean,

496
00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:53.090
I'm sure there's clay there that we can find

497
00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:55.290
that shouldn't be too hard.

498
00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:58.170
MATT: For this particular coastal area,

499
00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:01.110
there isn't a river nearby that opens into the ocean.

500
00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:01.943
LAURA: Sorry.

501
00:22:01.943 --> 00:22:02.870
MATT: So you might have to buy it.

502
00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:04.818
TALIESIN: They've got to have that pottery thing where

503
00:22:04.818 --> 00:22:07.185
yeah, you make your own pot then bake it.

504
00:22:07.185 --> 00:22:08.300
Assume those are always--

505
00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:10.325
LAURA: I think it was--
MARISHA: Right, just pottery.

506
00:22:10.325 --> 00:22:11.190
It's called pottery.

507
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:12.840
LAURA: Yeah, but this place you can,

508
00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:13.860
like, color it.
TALIESIN: You make your own,

509
00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:14.710
and then you color it.

510
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:15.543
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

511
00:22:15.543 --> 00:22:17.209
SAM: They give you paints and stuff, it's really cute.

512
00:22:17.209 --> 00:22:18.042
TALIESIN: It's all, oh.

513
00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:22.210
LAURA: You can make a picture frame for your mom.

514
00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:23.240
You can do all sorts of things.

515
00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:25.598
TRAVIS: You've all done this pottery thing?

516
00:22:25.598 --> 00:22:27.240
TALIESIN: I haven't.

517
00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:29.360
SAM: Pretty standard.
ASHLEY: I haven't done it.

518
00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:30.193
TRAVIS: Okay.

519
00:22:30.193 --> 00:22:31.434
SAM: I made a piggy bank once.

520
00:22:31.434 --> 00:22:32.877
TRAVIS: We're greenhorns, you and me.

521
00:22:32.877 --> 00:22:33.710
ASHLEY: Yeah, okay.

522
00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:37.010
MARISHA: That would actually be a fun afternoon.

523
00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:39.384
SAM: Just painting piggy banks.
ASHLEY: Painting pottery.

524
00:22:39.384 --> 00:22:41.240
MARISHA: Get a little day drunk, it's nice.

525
00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:43.538
TRAVIS: So to the Balleater,

526
00:22:43.538 --> 00:22:45.703
and we'll keep an eye out for jewelers on the way.

527
00:22:45.703 --> 00:22:47.003
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: All right.

528
00:22:47.003 --> 00:22:48.960
MATT: All right.
TRAVIS: Jester.

529
00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.800
MATT: As you make your way towards the southern coastline

530
00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:56.158
and the meeting of the Open Quay (Key),

531
00:22:56.158 --> 00:22:58.507
Quay (kway), it's Quay (kway) now, take it.

532
00:22:58.507 --> 00:23:00.540
(laughter)

533
00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:02.980
And the Restless Wharf, you can already see--

534
00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:05.130
LIAM: It's actually pronounced quinoa (keen-wah).

535
00:23:06.018 --> 00:23:07.810
[laughter]

536
00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:09.634
TRAVIS: No, no, don't, no, no, too early, too early!

537
00:23:09.634 --> 00:23:10.951
LAURA: Oh, no.

538
00:23:10.951 --> 00:23:14.060
MATT: That's metal, that would have hurt.

539
00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:19.060
You do notice in the inlet in the harbor, numerous ships.

540
00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:22.890
You can see, like, an organized array of naval ships

541
00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:25.980
bearing the Dwendalian crest

542
00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:29.280
across their crimson flags arranged within this harbor,

543
00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:32.070
flanked by the protective armada of the Concord.

544
00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:34.560
These ships are beginning their loading,

545
00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:37.193
it looks like, in preparation for a journey to come

546
00:23:37.193 --> 00:23:40.943
and you, knowing this, the size of these ships

547
00:23:40.943 --> 00:23:42.250
and taking a quick look past,

548
00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:44.870
they're not immediately ready to go.

549
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:47.700
They're probably a number of days off.

550
00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:51.230
And if you want to ask a few questions around the harbor,

551
00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:52.830
it seems that everyone's looking to leave within

552
00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:55.090
about four or five days.

553
00:23:55.090 --> 00:23:56.242
TRAVIS: Right.

554
00:23:56.242 --> 00:23:58.514
I suppose I could try and find a harbormaster

555
00:23:58.514 --> 00:23:59.789
and see if there's any sort of

556
00:23:59.789 --> 00:24:01.740
news or urgency or anything that we've missed

557
00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:03.406
while we've been away.

558
00:24:03.406 --> 00:24:05.140
Could I try and locate the harbormaster?

559
00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:06.023
MATT: You can, actually.

560
00:24:06.023 --> 00:24:09.690
Wharfmaster Ignus, you've briefly had conversation

561
00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:13.937
with before, right before you stole a ship.

562
00:24:13.937 --> 00:24:15.120
[laughter]

563
00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.003
TRAVIS: It went so well.

564
00:24:17.003 --> 00:24:18.790
MATT: You find that the older dwarven wharfmaster,

565
00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:21.560
who's, right now, you can see in his eyes,

566
00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:24.613
he's both frenetic with the amount of processing

567
00:24:24.613 --> 00:24:27.560
and organization he's having to tend to,

568
00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:29.740
but he's also stoic in showing exactly why he's been

569
00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:32.954
the wharfmaster as long as he has been and he's like,

570
00:24:32.954 --> 00:24:34.280
"Okay, go that way.

571
00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:36.190
"Make sure that ship is being done."

572
00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:37.470
TRAVIS: Excuse me, I'm sorry,

573
00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:40.080
it seems you're quite busy at the moment.

574
00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.330
MATT: "Yes, I quite am, actually.

575
00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:42.650
"What do you require from me?"

576
00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:44.140
TRAVIS: I noticed that

577
00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:46.420
there's more Empire ships here than there normally are.

578
00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:49.150
Is there any news on this potential meeting between

579
00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:51.040
the Dynasty and the Empire?

580
00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.670
MATT: "There are currently presenting a large swath of ships

581
00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:56.511
"to make their way eastward for this meeting

582
00:24:56.511 --> 00:24:57.743
"between them and the Dynasty.

583
00:24:57.743 --> 00:24:58.576
"That there's all that I know,

584
00:24:58.576 --> 00:24:59.770
"and that's all the time being paid for.

585
00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:00.603
"Excuse me."

586
00:25:00.603 --> 00:25:01.436
TRAVIS: Oh, yes.

587
00:25:01.436 --> 00:25:03.247
MATT: "No, you're doing it wrong."

588
00:25:03.247 --> 00:25:04.080
TRAVIS: I just meant to ask,

589
00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:06.870
is there any particular vendor that we should be paying

590
00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:08.820
attention to that the Empire might be using?

591
00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:11.310
Is there a particular shop that's getting

592
00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:13.760
a lot of traffic these days?

593
00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:15.130
MATT: "That is not my job,"

594
00:25:15.130 --> 00:25:16.495
and he just walks away.

595
00:25:16.495 --> 00:25:17.803
TRAVIS: Right, yep.

596
00:25:17.803 --> 00:25:21.002
They're real busy, it's super busy times.

597
00:25:21.002 --> 00:25:23.420
He said, like, the Balleater has a place of pride

598
00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:25.486
here in the harbor, which is good,

599
00:25:25.486 --> 00:25:27.680
it's real good.
LAURA: Oh, that's good.

600
00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:30.283
You're such a smooth talker, Fjord.

601
00:25:31.775 --> 00:25:33.041
TRAVIS: Yeah.

602
00:25:33.041 --> 00:25:35.689
[laughter]

603
00:25:35.689 --> 00:25:36.972
MATT: You do notice, perusing the docks,

604
00:25:36.972 --> 00:25:37.913
and even your conversations

605
00:25:37.913 --> 00:25:39.240
as you walk through the city here,

606
00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:40.765
the presence of the Zhelezo

607
00:25:40.765 --> 00:25:42.089
and the Shorewardens in particular,

608
00:25:42.089 --> 00:25:43.818
which are more of the front military,

609
00:25:43.818 --> 00:25:45.990
are much stronger as everyone's preparing for this coming

610
00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:48.170
journey mingling with Righteous Brand soldiers

611
00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:49.820
that are coming on and off ships.

612
00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:51.720
You can see them coming in and out of the various

613
00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:54.750
taverns themselves enjoying the brief vacation

614
00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:58.100
before they go to what is a very tense political gathering.

615
00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:03.180
You do see the largest

616
00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:05.230
of the ships in the harbor right now

617
00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:07.590
that's being loaded up with materials,

618
00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:10.070
alongside the name is The Blue Heaven,

619
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:15.070
and it carries the Dwendalian crest on it, but in doing so,

620
00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:17.560
the crests are the most decorated

621
00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:20.434
and it has the most military around it.

622
00:26:20.434 --> 00:26:21.760
TRAVIS: Oh.
LAURA: Ooh.

623
00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:24.030
That's where the important people are.

624
00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:26.490
TRAVIS: Yeah, I know, I should have asked the wharfmaster

625
00:26:26.490 --> 00:26:27.850
what that ship is for.

626
00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:28.820
LAURA: Yeah.

627
00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:30.738
MATT: Caleb.
LIAM: Yeah?

628
00:26:30.738 --> 00:26:31.880
MATT: Not far from the Blue Heaven,

629
00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:34.070
there is a smaller redwood sailing ship

630
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:38.070
that is visibly very different in make and style

631
00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:38.903
of the other ships around

632
00:26:38.903 --> 00:26:41.286
and it carries the Cerberus Assembly flag

633
00:26:41.286 --> 00:26:43.036
across the top of it.

634
00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:47.420
LIAM: How distant is it from us at the moment?

635
00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:48.253
MATT: From where you are now,

636
00:26:48.253 --> 00:26:50.960
it's probably, like, four or 500 feet.

637
00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:53.990
LIAM: And do I see anyone that I recognize?

638
00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:56.048
MATT: Make a perception check.

639
00:26:56.048 --> 00:26:58.810
LAURA: (alarm beeping)
TRAVIS: Fireball that ship?

640
00:26:58.810 --> 00:27:00.210
SAM: First roll of the night.

641
00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:01.043
First roll of the night.

642
00:27:01.043 --> 00:27:02.711
LAURA: (gasps) No!

643
00:27:02.711 --> 00:27:05.469
[cheering]

644
00:27:06.669 --> 00:27:07.870
MARISHA: Traveler Con 3000!

645
00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:08.703
TALIESIN: We're waiting.

646
00:27:08.703 --> 00:27:11.240
What did you roll?
LAURA: Traveler Con 3000!

647
00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:14.640
MATT: No, you do not. You see nobody

648
00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:17.270
of interest or memory.

649
00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:20.030
You got distracted looking towards the ship and instead

650
00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:20.863
found, like, a cute little puppy

651
00:27:20.863 --> 00:27:23.930
that looks lost on the side of the... (laughs)

652
00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:25.563
TRAVIS: That's a strange place for a dog.

653
00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:28.420
LIAM: Oh, you're a good boy.

654
00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:32.670
I will call you

655
00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:33.503
Henry.

656
00:27:33.503 --> 00:27:34.900
MATT: (snarling)

657
00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:37.933
ASHLEY: Oh, the goodest of boys!

658
00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:42.130
MARISHA: Are there any Dwendalian ships?

659
00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:43.060
MATT: Numerous, actually.

660
00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:45.850
MARISHA: Or sorry, not Dwendalian, Xhorhasian ships.

661
00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:48.108
MATT: No.
MARISHA: Okay.

662
00:27:48.108 --> 00:27:49.998
MATT: No, there are none.
LAURA: That would be super bad.

663
00:27:49.998 --> 00:27:52.490
SAM: Henry looks like a nice lunch.

664
00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:55.410
[laughter]

665
00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:57.920
LIAM: I thought we were past that months ago.

666
00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:00.186
SAM: I just, it's my last day, so...

667
00:28:00.186 --> 00:28:03.186
[laughter]

668
00:28:04.194 --> 00:28:06.937
Just want that sweet, sweet dog flesh.

669
00:28:06.937 --> 00:28:10.745
ASHLEY: Yeah, I actually know a very good dog recipes

670
00:28:10.745 --> 00:28:13.440
if that is what you want to be your last meal.
SAM: Oh, really? Is it

671
00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:15.804
grilled or fried or?

672
00:28:15.804 --> 00:28:19.325
TRAVIS: No, we don't eat dogs in The Mighty Nein.

673
00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:24.970
ASHLEY: Well, everything is a meal
if you prepare it correctly.

674
00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:27.290
TRAVIS: Oh wow.

675
00:28:27.290 --> 00:28:29.005
TALIESIN: It's not entirely untrue.

676
00:28:29.005 --> 00:28:30.630
MARISHA: I'd try it.

677
00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:32.830
LIAM: It is better than babies, though, I suppose.

678
00:28:34.650 --> 00:28:36.191
ASHLEY: Babies are very tender.

679
00:28:36.191 --> 00:28:37.228
TRAVIS: What f--

680
00:28:37.228 --> 00:28:40.228
[laughter]

681
00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:43.690
I quickly walk over to one of the closest Zhelezo

682
00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:46.504
and say: Excuse me, if I might trouble you.

683
00:28:46.504 --> 00:28:48.170
MATT: "Yes, yes, what do you--"
TRAVIS: That large ship over there,

684
00:28:48.170 --> 00:28:51.190
The Blue Heaven, I see. Whose vessel is that?

685
00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:55.190
MATT: "Oh, that will be a Captain Deremi. I think Lord--

686
00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:57.670
"the emissary from the Empire is on that one."

687
00:28:57.670 --> 00:28:58.960
TRAVIS: Captain Deremi.

688
00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:01.200
MATT: "Yes, Deremi."
TRAVIS: Deremi.

689
00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:03.280
Oh, thank you very much I appreciate that.

690
00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:05.023
MATT: "You're welcome."

691
00:29:05.023 --> 00:29:06.900
And he goes back to work.

692
00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:09.980
TRAVIS: Can I see the Balleater?

693
00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:10.871
MATT: You can, actually.

694
00:29:10.871 --> 00:29:13.890
It's actually quite a ways away.

695
00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:14.748
It's tucked off to

696
00:29:14.748 --> 00:29:17.410
the far eastern side of the docks.

697
00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:19.420
It looks like it's been there for a little while.

698
00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:20.920
TRAVIS: Keeping a low profile.

699
00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:22.513
SAM: You got to tuck that Balleater, yeah.

700
00:29:22.513 --> 00:29:23.346
TRAVIS: Yeah.

701
00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:26.760
MATT: But, nevertheless, it is there and available

702
00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:28.360
for you to find.

703
00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:29.900
TRAVIS: Shall we make our way over to it, see know--

704
00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:31.583
LAURA: Sure, sure, sure, though do I see

705
00:29:31.583 --> 00:29:34.370
any, you know, gem dust on the way there?

706
00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:36.686
SAM: Do I see 50 pounds of clay?

707
00:29:36.686 --> 00:29:39.460
[laughter]

708
00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:40.816
LIAM: Right there.
LAURA: Did we pass a jeweler?

709
00:29:40.816 --> 00:29:42.124
Did we pass a jeweler?

710
00:29:42.124 --> 00:29:43.280
TALIESIN: I'm keeping an eye out.

711
00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:44.688
MATT: Not on the docks, unfortunately.

712
00:29:44.688 --> 00:29:45.747
You guys would have to go more into town

713
00:29:45.747 --> 00:29:48.450
to the more marketing district.
LAURA: I will do that later then.

714
00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:49.283
MATT: Okay.

715
00:29:49.283 --> 00:29:51.158
But later when you want to go to the marketing region

716
00:29:51.158 --> 00:29:52.500
of Nicodranas, we can go ahead and do that.

717
00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:53.680
LAURA: Okay.

718
00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:55.630
MATT: All right, so you make your way towards the Balleater.

719
00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:57.372
(sighs)

720
00:29:57.372 --> 00:29:59.330
(laughter)

721
00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:00.200
TRAVIS: The Balleater.

722
00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:01.160
MATT: Yes, the Balleater.

723
00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:02.941
TRAVIS: The Balleater.

724
00:30:02.941 --> 00:30:04.973
MATT: Yes, the custom ship I worked really hard

725
00:30:04.973 --> 00:30:06.757
to have custom made and present to you guys

726
00:30:06.757 --> 00:30:09.070
with a cool opportunity to name your one fantasy ship.

727
00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:11.349
LIAM: Hey guys, what's that book called again?

728
00:30:11.349 --> 00:30:13.553
AUDIENCE: The Balleater!

729
00:30:13.553 --> 00:30:14.486
LIAM: That's the one.

730
00:30:14.486 --> 00:30:15.611
TRAVIS: (laughter) Holy fuck.

731
00:30:15.611 --> 00:30:18.444
[laughter]

732
00:30:18.444 --> 00:30:19.527
Yeah, yeah.

733
00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:23.696
Never had 3000 people shout that at you before.

734
00:30:23.696 --> 00:30:25.946
(laughter)

735
00:30:26.887 --> 00:30:29.303
[cheering]

736
00:30:29.303 --> 00:30:30.886
MATT: That's a new one.

737
00:30:34.028 --> 00:30:36.419
As you approach, though, you can see

738
00:30:36.419 --> 00:30:40.894
it's probably been docked for the
better part of a week or so

739
00:30:40.894 --> 00:30:43.393
and on the deck, sitting back in a chair

740
00:30:43.393 --> 00:30:46.168
and eating what looks to be

741
00:30:46.168 --> 00:30:48.908
a sausage of some kind is Marius LePual,

742
00:30:48.908 --> 00:30:51.220
the half-elven figure with his, like, blond flop.

743
00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:54.147
He looks like he's growing a bit of a stubbly beard now.

744
00:30:54.147 --> 00:30:56.430
He looks up at you guys.

745
00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:58.246
And it's, like, a stubbly beard meaning that,

746
00:30:58.246 --> 00:31:00.780
as much as an elf could really manage

747
00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:03.454
with weeks and weeks and weeks at sea. It's like a...

748
00:31:03.454 --> 00:31:04.869
(squeaking)

749
00:31:04.869 --> 00:31:06.369
[laughter]

750
00:31:06.369 --> 00:31:08.093
But looks up and gives a wave and goes,

751
00:31:08.093 --> 00:31:10.430
"Hoy, ha ha ha ha."

752
00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:11.271
TRAVIS: Look alive.

753
00:31:11.271 --> 00:31:14.530
Look at you you look very sea worthy, rugged even.

754
00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:15.380
MATT: "Oh, thank you, thank you.

755
00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:17.580
"It's been a journey.

756
00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:18.750
"I've learned a lot."

757
00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:20.770
TRAVIS: Have you killed anyone in the time we've been away?

758
00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:22.353
MATT: "No! Was I supposed to?"

759
00:31:22.353 --> 00:31:24.430
[laughter]

760
00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:26.210
TRAVIS: Yasha, I need you to speak to him later.

761
00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:28.170
MATT: "I didn't, what did I do?"
ASHLEY: Yeah.

762
00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:29.430
MATT: "I'm sorry I didn't..."

763
00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:31.171
ASHLEY: Well, it's not a journey

764
00:31:31.171 --> 00:31:34.504
if people were not killed along the way.

765
00:31:35.861 --> 00:31:38.790
That's just how I view things, but maybe--

766
00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:40.650
MARISHA: No, I thought it was, it's not a journey

767
00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:45.100
unless you're shilled along the way, right?

768
00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:45.933
SAM: Shilled?

769
00:31:45.933 --> 00:31:49.141
MARISHA: Yeah, like, you know, never mind.

770
00:31:49.141 --> 00:31:50.740
(laughter)

771
00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:51.820
LAURA: What do his clothes look like?

772
00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:54.475
Are they fancy still or are they rugged?

773
00:31:54.475 --> 00:31:57.908
MATT: It looks like his sense of style hasn't waned,

774
00:31:57.908 --> 00:32:00.340
though he's now wearing them a little tattered.

775
00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:02.940
He's going for that, like, I was once nobility,

776
00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:06.279
but now the world is my oyster kind of look.

777
00:32:06.279 --> 00:32:07.245
ASHLEY: Yes.
MATT: You know?

778
00:32:07.245 --> 00:32:08.078
LAURA: Yeah.

779
00:32:08.078 --> 00:32:09.670
MATT: As you're getting a close look

780
00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:10.642
as you guys approach up on

781
00:32:10.642 --> 00:32:13.105
the gangplank to get onto the actual deck of the ship,

782
00:32:13.105 --> 00:32:15.140
it all looks to be intentionally tattered.

783
00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:17.850
Like, it's not actually weathered from being at sea.

784
00:32:17.850 --> 00:32:18.800
Like, he sat there at night

785
00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:21.240
and just, like, rubbed it really hard and yeah.

786
00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:22.380
LAURA: It's like those fancy jeans you buy.

787
00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:23.950
LIAM: Yeah, stress washed jeans.

788
00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:25.375
MATT: Yeah, yeah.

789
00:32:25.375 --> 00:32:26.208
LAURA: Perfect.

790
00:32:26.208 --> 00:32:28.667
MATT: Very much his theme.
TRAVIS: $250.

791
00:32:28.667 --> 00:32:30.640
MATT: "But no welcome, welcome.

792
00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:32.880
"Yeah, as far as we're gathering,

793
00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:34.930
"we have a little ways before the armada is leaving.

794
00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:36.040
"Do we need to leave early?

795
00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:38.140
"Do they know are coming, like, what's the deal here?

796
00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:39.133
"Should I go get the captain?

797
00:32:39.133 --> 00:32:40.258
"I mean, you're the captain now."

798
00:32:40.258 --> 00:32:41.590
TRAVIS: Yes, I am.

799
00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:42.750
It's quite fluid, actually.

800
00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:44.910
I mean, is the boat prepared to leave?

801
00:32:44.910 --> 00:32:46.390
Do we need rations or--

802
00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:49.147
MATT: "No, we've loaded everything up.

803
00:32:49.147 --> 00:32:51.643
"(whistling)" He does a very loud finger whistle.

804
00:32:51.643 --> 00:32:53.185
And then a short time later you hear the

805
00:32:53.185 --> 00:32:56.420
(heavy feet plodding) looming up to the deck of the ship.

806
00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:57.253
TRAVIS: Bring it.

807
00:32:57.253 --> 00:32:58.804
MATT: Orly's shell crests over in the sunlight.

808
00:32:58.804 --> 00:33:01.804
[cheering]

809
00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:07.266
"Well, real happy to see all y'all

810
00:33:07.266 --> 00:33:09.349
"come on back around here.

811
00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:14.750
"Ship has been prepared for our journey."

812
00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:17.042
LAURA: I run up and hug a Orly.

813
00:33:17.042 --> 00:33:19.241
MATT: "(laughs)

814
00:33:19.241 --> 00:33:22.910
"M-m-mighty fine to see you all."

815
00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:23.743
LAURA: You do.

816
00:33:23.743 --> 00:33:25.560
SAM: So great to see you Orly.

817
00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:26.790
MATT: "You as well."

818
00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:32.259
TRAVIS: Thank you for taking such
excellent care of the ship.

819
00:33:32.259 --> 00:33:36.310
Marius looks quite, um, weathered.

820
00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:38.843
MATT: "Yeah, we're working on him.

821
00:33:38.843 --> 00:33:40.801
[laughter]

822
00:33:40.801 --> 00:33:42.013
"I figure about

823
00:33:42.013 --> 00:33:46.513
"m-m-maybe three more

824
00:33:46.513 --> 00:33:47.846
"more years."

825
00:33:47.846 --> 00:33:49.800
(laughter)

826
00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:50.810
TRAVIS: That's quite a bit of time.

827
00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:52.901
MARISHA: Yeah, he's not going to make it, Orly.

828
00:33:52.901 --> 00:33:55.966
(laughter)
Uh-uh.

829
00:33:55.966 --> 00:33:59.220
MATT: "I've broken in lesser m-m-men before.

830
00:34:00.550 --> 00:34:02.366
"Watch m-m-me."

831
00:34:02.366 --> 00:34:05.090
LIAM: And, how is our seafaring vessel?

832
00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:06.930
We are ready to go at the drop of the hat?

833
00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:08.840
MATT: "All ready.

834
00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:12.923
"We've supplied up and able to

835
00:34:12.923 --> 00:34:14.900
"go to sea whenever."

836
00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:15.770
LAURA: Great.

837
00:34:15.770 --> 00:34:18.040
I guess we'll just wait for everyone else to go

838
00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:19.948
and then we'll go and then

839
00:34:19.948 --> 00:34:22.356
we'll just sail along with them

840
00:34:22.356 --> 00:34:25.630
and then we'll, you know, watch them.

841
00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:30.630
MATT: "I recommend m-m-maybe

842
00:34:31.802 --> 00:34:34.152
"letting them know you are coming."

843
00:34:34.152 --> 00:34:35.954
TALIESIN: Oh, wow, yeah, I was thinking the same thing

844
00:34:35.954 --> 00:34:36.787
That's good.

845
00:34:36.787 --> 00:34:37.620
LAURA: That's really smart.

846
00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:41.411
MATT: "Otherwise we're liable to get, you know,

847
00:34:41.411 --> 00:34:43.569
"blown out of the water."

848
00:34:43.569 --> 00:34:44.660
[laughter]

849
00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:46.326
TRAVIS: Right.
LAURA: Good call.

850
00:34:46.326 --> 00:34:47.620
I should send a message to the Bright Queen

851
00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:50.506
and let her know to let them know.

852
00:34:50.506 --> 00:34:51.339
MATT: "What?"

853
00:34:51.339 --> 00:34:54.014
[laughter]

854
00:34:54.014 --> 00:34:54.847
MARISHA: Is that right?

855
00:34:54.847 --> 00:34:55.680
TRAVIS: I don't know if--

856
00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:59.210
that's seems like a step too many.

857
00:34:59.210 --> 00:35:02.590
Maybe we just send a message to this Captain Deremi

858
00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:05.310
and tell them that we're seeking an audience?

859
00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:07.650
LAURA: Oh yeah, and then we just tell him

860
00:35:07.650 --> 00:35:09.808
we know the Bright Queen, she's, like, super--

861
00:35:09.808 --> 00:35:11.265
and then we show our things.

862
00:35:11.265 --> 00:35:14.033
TRAVIS: Or that we also know King Dwendal and,
what was your--

863
00:35:14.033 --> 00:35:16.083
LAURA: Oh shit, that's right we're not,

864
00:35:16.083 --> 00:35:18.416
that would be really bad.

865
00:35:18.416 --> 00:35:20.666
(laughter)

866
00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:23.500
I didn't think about that part.

867
00:35:25.191 --> 00:35:29.399
MATT: "I highly they recommend you get all that straight."

868
00:35:29.399 --> 00:35:31.878
(laughter)

869
00:35:31.878 --> 00:35:35.450
TRAVIS: I thought there was a reason, but there wasn't.

870
00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:36.283
TRAVIS: Yeah, Ludinus,

871
00:35:36.283 --> 00:35:37.390
Ludinus Da'leth.
MARISHA: Ludinus Da'leth.

872
00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:38.650
LIAM: Correct.

873
00:35:38.650 --> 00:35:39.483
MARISHA: Yeah, he's probably the one

874
00:35:39.483 --> 00:35:41.070
we should really check in with.

875
00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:42.487
LAURA: I'll send a message to Ludinus

876
00:35:42.487 --> 00:35:44.500
and then he can let the captain know that we're coming.

877
00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:45.920
TRAVIS: That would be excellent.

878
00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:48.280
LIAM: We could also just walk over to the boat.

879
00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:51.910
Look, it's right over there.

880
00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:54.090
And I was thinking, perhaps one of the things

881
00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:58.060
on our to-do list today is to have a face to face there.

882
00:35:58.060 --> 00:35:59.590
SAM: Sure, yeah.

883
00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:00.423
LAURA: Okay.

884
00:36:00.423 --> 00:36:02.331
SAM: Now's a good as a time as any.
ASHLEY: We're here.

885
00:36:02.331 --> 00:36:03.623
TRAVIS: Yeah, we could try.

886
00:36:03.623 --> 00:36:05.464
If they turn us away then we can do the message.

887
00:36:05.464 --> 00:36:08.289
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: "Mm-hmm."

888
00:36:08.289 --> 00:36:10.780
TRAVIS: Thank you for keeping
the ship in such excellent shape.

889
00:36:10.780 --> 00:36:14.610
We have a few more things to tie up and then we'll be back.

890
00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:19.610
MATT: "Well captain, happy to be back to your navigator.

891
00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:24.096
"Welcome, Tusktooth, the ship is yours."

892
00:36:24.096 --> 00:36:25.590
[cheering]

893
00:36:25.590 --> 00:36:28.565
(heavy feet plodding)

894
00:36:28.565 --> 00:36:31.606
And he slowly stomps back under deck.

895
00:36:31.606 --> 00:36:32.500
TRAVIS: Tusktooth.

896
00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:33.866
LAURA: He lives!

897
00:36:33.866 --> 00:36:35.710
[laughter]

898
00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:36.685
TRAVIS: Yes, he does.

899
00:36:36.685 --> 00:36:40.689
LAURA: Do you think Ludinus would allow me to tattoo him?

900
00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:43.797
LIAM: I do not.

901
00:36:43.797 --> 00:36:45.300
[laughter]

902
00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:46.133
LAURA: I'm going to ask.

903
00:36:46.133 --> 00:36:47.433
You know, you just never know.

904
00:36:47.433 --> 00:36:49.191
TRAVIS: Oh, I, um...

905
00:36:49.191 --> 00:36:50.858
LAURA: It's okay.
TRAVIS: Okay.

906
00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:53.310
Shall we make our way over then?

907
00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:54.630
SAM: Let's go.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

908
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:56.746
TRAVIS: We will make our way across the docks

909
00:36:56.746 --> 00:36:58.360
towards the Blue Heaven.

910
00:36:58.360 --> 00:36:59.193
MATT: The Blue Heaven, or the--

911
00:36:59.193 --> 00:37:01.070
LIAM: No, the the redwood ship.

912
00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:04.350
The smaller one is where the Cerberus Assembly is.

913
00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:06.110
TRAVIS: Oh, <i>that's</i> where you want to go?

914
00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:06.985
LIAM and LAURA: Yeah.

915
00:37:06.985 --> 00:37:08.309
TRAVIS: Okay.

916
00:37:08.309 --> 00:37:09.710
MATT: All right.

917
00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:12.335
You make your way a little ways down,

918
00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:16.000
down the wharf to the redwood ship.

919
00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.042
As you approach, you now can see

920
00:37:19.042 --> 00:37:21.488
the title of it is The Wind of Aeons.

921
00:37:21.488 --> 00:37:23.037
MARISHA: (scoffs)

922
00:37:23.037 --> 00:37:25.019
[laughter]

923
00:37:25.019 --> 00:37:27.930
TRAVIS: What is it, Beau, I just heard you make a--

924
00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:30.529
MARISHA: Just, fucking Wind of Aeons.

925
00:37:30.529 --> 00:37:33.657
Fucking how up your own ass can you be?

926
00:37:33.657 --> 00:37:36.365
[laughter]

927
00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:39.103
TRAVIS: Right.

928
00:37:40.665 --> 00:37:43.190
You know, it's just the name of a ship, so.

929
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:45.306
SAM: Yeah, but she's right. I mean...

930
00:37:45.306 --> 00:37:47.406
[laughter]

931
00:37:47.406 --> 00:37:49.472
LAURA: It ain't no Balleater.
SAM: The Balleater is like,

932
00:37:49.472 --> 00:37:50.846
you know what it is.
LAURA: Classy.

933
00:37:50.846 --> 00:37:52.030
SAM: It's classy.

934
00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:55.878
It sticks with you.

935
00:37:56.830 --> 00:37:58.860
The Balleater makes an impression.

936
00:37:58.860 --> 00:38:00.435
LAURA: That's right.

937
00:38:01.608 --> 00:38:04.215
LIAM: Bad aftertaste, though.

938
00:38:04.215 --> 00:38:06.510
[laughter]

939
00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:09.376
SAM: It's that sea salt, you know?

940
00:38:09.376 --> 00:38:11.479
[laughter]

941
00:38:11.479 --> 00:38:13.729
TRAVIS: (coughing)

942
00:38:16.998 --> 00:38:18.928
[laughter]

943
00:38:18.928 --> 00:38:20.485
SAM: (repeated kissing)

944
00:38:20.485 --> 00:38:21.768
LAURA: Stop it with the mouth.

945
00:38:21.768 --> 00:38:24.426
Stop it, no stop it, no!

946
00:38:24.426 --> 00:38:25.397
Stop it!

947
00:38:25.397 --> 00:38:29.141
[laughter]

948
00:38:29.141 --> 00:38:29.974
Don't!

949
00:38:31.413 --> 00:38:32.413
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

950
00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:38.577
SAM: Are we getting banned on Twitch right now?

951
00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:41.273
SAM: Stop, Sam, please.

952
00:38:41.273 --> 00:38:45.010
TRAVIS: Oh, for the love of god.

953
00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:45.843
LIAM: I'm having the weirdest

954
00:38:45.843 --> 00:38:48.919
Planet of the Ape fantasy right now.

955
00:38:48.919 --> 00:38:51.144
(laughter)

956
00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:57.918
TRAVIS: Right, to the Winds of Aeon.

957
00:38:57.918 --> 00:39:01.301
MATT: As you continue walking along the dock

958
00:39:01.301 --> 00:39:03.130
to the front of the ship,

959
00:39:03.130 --> 00:39:06.750
the first thing that greets you is about a half-dozen

960
00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:09.400
Righteous Brand soldiers that immediately begin to

961
00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:11.666
flank up at the front of the gang peak

962
00:39:11.666 --> 00:39:14.250
that leads onto the ship as you approach.

963
00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:16.930
TRAVIS: I will reach into one of my satchels

964
00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:18.815
and pull out the symbol of the Bright Queen,

965
00:39:18.815 --> 00:39:21.040
but we'll keep it close.
MARISHA: No.

966
00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:22.098
LAURA: Not the Bright Queen.

967
00:39:22.098 --> 00:39:23.643
TRAVIS: To the middle of my chest,

968
00:39:23.643 --> 00:39:25.975
flanked by both of my arms and just keep it in front.

969
00:39:25.975 --> 00:39:26.808
MATT: Okay.

970
00:39:26.808 --> 00:39:28.577
TRAVIS: And say we request an audience.

971
00:39:28.577 --> 00:39:29.410
MATT: All right.

972
00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:32.310
SAM: Didn't we have a symbol from the Empire?

973
00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:33.560
LAURA: We have a symbol from--

974
00:39:35.412 --> 00:39:36.245
TRAVIS: I'm sorry, yes.

975
00:39:36.245 --> 00:39:38.061
Did I say, I said the fucking Bright Queen.

976
00:39:38.061 --> 00:39:39.539
LAURA: You did it, too! You did it, too!

977
00:39:39.539 --> 00:39:40.522
You fucking did it, too!

978
00:39:40.522 --> 00:39:41.355
TRAVIS: It's my fault.

979
00:39:41.355 --> 00:39:42.555
[laughter]

980
00:39:42.555 --> 00:39:44.480
It is contagious.

981
00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:47.540
MATT: So would you like to correct
the symbol you've prepared?

982
00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:49.795
TRAVIS: Yes retcon. (imitating speaking backwards)

983
00:39:49.795 --> 00:39:51.811
MATT: There you go, okay.

984
00:39:52.667 --> 00:39:54.140
LIAM: Yeah, we would like to request a meeting

985
00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:58.306
with Martinet Da'leth and Master Ikithon,

986
00:39:58.306 --> 00:40:00.320
if they're present.

987
00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:01.460
MATT: They look at each other.

988
00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:03.590
The one that looks to be a little more decorated

989
00:40:03.590 --> 00:40:05.080
just goes forth and goes,

990
00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:10.750
"And who might you be, if I could ask, please."

991
00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:12.736
MARISHA: We're The Mighty Nein.

992
00:40:12.736 --> 00:40:16.244
[cheering]

993
00:40:16.244 --> 00:40:17.787
LIAM: They are expecting us.

994
00:40:17.787 --> 00:40:21.120
MARISHA: We're here as liaisons to the meeting.

995
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:23.970
MATT: "I'll return momentarily.

996
00:40:23.970 --> 00:40:28.970
"Do not move or make any sort of
aggressive actions, please."

997
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.590
LAURA: What about just, like, dancing?

998
00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:32.923
Can we just dance?

999
00:40:32.923 --> 00:40:36.083
If our hands are down at our sides the whole time?

1000
00:40:36.083 --> 00:40:38.010
[laughter]

1001
00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:40.360
MATT: They all check in with eye contact once more.

1002
00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:44.270
"I think that would be allowed, <i>ja</i>."

1003
00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:47.186
[laughter]

1004
00:40:47.186 --> 00:40:48.440
LAURA: All right we'll be here.

1005
00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:49.273
MATT: "Commence."

1006
00:40:49.273 --> 00:40:50.470
[laughter]

1007
00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:53.620
Turns around onto the ship.

1008
00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:54.803
TRAVIS: We're going to die.

1009
00:40:54.803 --> 00:40:57.140
[laughter]

1010
00:40:57.140 --> 00:40:59.660
MATT: You watch as the five other Righteous Brand soldiers

1011
00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:01.918
stand there staring awkwardly

1012
00:41:01.918 --> 00:41:03.654
and one of them starts to

1013
00:41:03.654 --> 00:41:05.178
get into the groove, too.
TRAVIS: Shut up!

1014
00:41:05.178 --> 00:41:08.300
(laughter)

1015
00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:09.250
MATT: Before the others notice

1016
00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:12.880
and slap his arm and he's like,
(throat clear) back into place.

1017
00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:15.277
SAM: That's why they call them righteous.

1018
00:41:15.277 --> 00:41:17.735
(laughter)

1019
00:41:17.735 --> 00:41:20.100
MATT: Eventually the one returns and goes,

1020
00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:21.700
"You may step aboard,"

1021
00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:23.060
steps aside and you guys are able

1022
00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:24.940
to step onto the gangplank,

1023
00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:27.359
onto the Wind of Aeons.

1024
00:41:27.359 --> 00:41:31.800
There, the ship deck is mostly clear,

1025
00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:33.391
beautifully made,

1026
00:41:33.391 --> 00:41:35.916
the inlay along the edges of the deck

1027
00:41:35.916 --> 00:41:39.049
and the handles have a whether it's gold leafed

1028
00:41:39.049 --> 00:41:40.780
or at least painted the look gold,

1029
00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:42.560
it's garish in the way that you would expect

1030
00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:44.785
from the Cerberus Assembly's singular ship

1031
00:41:44.785 --> 00:41:45.968
that is so rarely used,

1032
00:41:45.968 --> 00:41:48.117
that they have to make an impression when they do go to sea.

1033
00:41:48.117 --> 00:41:48.950
MARISHA: Gross.

1034
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:51.880
MATT: Which, to a certain extent, is probably a step down

1035
00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:53.620
from those who can jump from place to place

1036
00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:56.680
in the world without issue.

1037
00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:59.600
So if they're going to do it, they have to do it in style.

1038
00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:01.500
But there on the deck you see three figures

1039
00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:03.441
in the middle of a conversation.

1040
00:42:03.441 --> 00:42:07.691
You see Ludinus Da'leth, the older elven figure there

1041
00:42:07.691 --> 00:42:09.300
in the middle of a conversation

1042
00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:10.842
with two other individuals.

1043
00:42:10.842 --> 00:42:13.450
You see a human male

1044
00:42:13.450 --> 00:42:16.870
in maybe his late forties or so,

1045
00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:19.111
in this long black robe

1046
00:42:19.111 --> 00:42:22.800
with silver and blue detailing on it.

1047
00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:24.791
He has this salt and pepper hair

1048
00:42:24.791 --> 00:42:26.099
that's a little long

1049
00:42:26.099 --> 00:42:28.774
and it's got this curl to it

1050
00:42:28.774 --> 00:42:29.690
pushed to one side.

1051
00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:32.960
You can see he's very much a mage who wants to put together

1052
00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:36.370
a good impression in a social space.

1053
00:42:36.370 --> 00:42:40.953
Make a history check, both Beauregard and Caleb for me.

1054
00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:44.893
LIAM: 16.

1055
00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:47.502
MARISHA: 19.
SAM: Ooh.

1056
00:42:47.502 --> 00:42:49.400
MATT: Okay.

1057
00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:50.983
Caleb, you know this from your studies

1058
00:42:50.983 --> 00:42:53.407
and you as well would know from reading about it

1059
00:42:53.407 --> 00:42:54.280
and some couple of,

1060
00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:55.630
especially this individual.

1061
00:42:55.630 --> 00:42:58.305
This is Lord Athesius Uludan.

1062
00:42:58.305 --> 00:42:59.138
LAURA: Yeah.

1063
00:42:59.138 --> 00:43:02.110
MATT: Who is the arch mage of Diplomatic Union.

1064
00:43:02.110 --> 00:43:03.440
It is the member of the Cerberus Assembly

1065
00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:06.660
that largely goes out as the ambassador of the Assembly

1066
00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:08.750
to foreign powers and foreign interests

1067
00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:11.050
and noble circles that are beyond the Empire,

1068
00:43:11.050 --> 00:43:14.250
or even within the Empire that needs some smoothing over.

1069
00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:15.108
You could already see in the way that

1070
00:43:15.108 --> 00:43:18.283
he's talking to the Martinet,

1071
00:43:18.283 --> 00:43:20.491
there's, like, a half-cocked grin to his expression

1072
00:43:20.491 --> 00:43:22.340
and very much a practiced,

1073
00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:27.340
very smooth, tailored persona to a social charismatic

1074
00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:30.420
and persuasive interaction.

1075
00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:34.620
The third individual you see looks to be another male elf,

1076
00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:38.395
though younger, pale skin

1077
00:43:38.395 --> 00:43:40.360
and silver and teal robes.

1078
00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:42.990
The hair is a faint, dirty blonde

1079
00:43:42.990 --> 00:43:46.855
and very short coming to a point in the front.

1080
00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:51.060
Neither of you recognize this figure,

1081
00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:52.870
but this figure seems to be engaged in conversation.

1082
00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:54.995
As they're all talking, the Martinet notices you

1083
00:43:54.995 --> 00:43:56.890
as you step aboard and goes,

1084
00:43:56.890 --> 00:44:01.090
"Oh, hello so glad you could make it?"

1085
00:44:02.380 --> 00:44:05.730
LIAM: You were expecting us to be here, were you not?

1086
00:44:05.730 --> 00:44:09.650
MATT: "Well, you discussed the possibility of joining,

1087
00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:13.126
"so, welcome. Hmm.

1088
00:44:13.126 --> 00:44:15.179
"I'm sorry, my manners.

1089
00:44:15.179 --> 00:44:18.980
"This is Lord Athesius Uludan," who bows and goes,

1090
00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:21.071
(light French accent) "It is a pleasure to meet all of you.

1091
00:44:21.071 --> 00:44:23.040
"What is your name?"

1092
00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:24.815
SAM: We're The Mighty Nein.

1093
00:44:24.815 --> 00:44:26.098
MATT: "Mighty Nein."

1094
00:44:26.098 --> 00:44:28.519
SAM: We're a band of heroes who

1095
00:44:28.519 --> 00:44:30.844
has set out to save the world

1096
00:44:30.844 --> 00:44:33.540
and we're darn tootin' nearly done.

1097
00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:35.360
[laughter]

1098
00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:36.790
MATT: "Well, that is mighty impressive.

1099
00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:40.120
"I am extremely humbled by your presence."

1100
00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:42.020
SAM: I think we've heard of you, actually.

1101
00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:44.433
MATT: "Really?

1102
00:44:45.890 --> 00:44:47.790
"I did not know that my name got around

1103
00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:49.198
"in the goblin circles.

1104
00:44:49.198 --> 00:44:51.031
"This is very exciting."

1105
00:44:53.010 --> 00:44:54.626
SAM: Yeah, we talk.

1106
00:44:54.626 --> 00:44:56.680
[laughter]

1107
00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:59.390
MATT: "Well, whoever cares, tells them that I say hello."

1108
00:44:59.390 --> 00:45:01.770
LIAM: We are less familiar with your friend over here.

1109
00:45:01.770 --> 00:45:04.753
MATT: "This is a Lord Dezran Thain,"

1110
00:45:04.753 --> 00:45:06.519
and he points over and the other figure,

1111
00:45:06.519 --> 00:45:07.920
that one figure, steps forward and goes,

1112
00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:10.920
"My apologies for not introducing myself.

1113
00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:13.978
"I am just one of the lords of here in Nicodranas

1114
00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:17.380
"and I'm meeting with some friends in preparation

1115
00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:18.840
"for the journey ahead."

1116
00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:20.290
LAURA: Would I recognize him them?

1117
00:45:21.130 --> 00:45:23.211
MATT: Make a history check.

1118
00:45:23.211 --> 00:45:25.739
TRAVIS: ♪ Has he been to your mom's house ♪

1119
00:45:25.739 --> 00:45:29.225
[laughter]

1120
00:45:29.225 --> 00:45:33.110
LAURA: ♪ Has he done a lot of fucking ♪

1121
00:45:33.110 --> 00:45:35.700
Just five.

1122
00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:36.983
MATT: You do not recognize this person at all.

1123
00:45:36.983 --> 00:45:38.520
LAURA: I don't recognize him.

1124
00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:40.950
It's been a couple years, you know, so...

1125
00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:41.792
Has it been?

1126
00:45:41.792 --> 00:45:43.550
I don't know how long it's been.

1127
00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:45.400
TRAVIS: It's been years.

1128
00:45:46.270 --> 00:45:47.611
LIAM: ♪ It's been... ♪

1129
00:45:47.611 --> 00:45:48.444
MATT: Don't.

1130
00:45:48.444 --> 00:45:52.677
[laughter]

1131
00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:58.173
Caduceus and Caleb,

1132
00:45:58.173 --> 00:46:02.245
this elven figure does seem a bit nervous

1133
00:46:02.245 --> 00:46:05.360
in your presence upon meeting.
LIAM: Is he bullshitting us?

1134
00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:06.193
MATT: You don't know.

1135
00:46:06.193 --> 00:46:09.101
The person immediately seems to be like,

1136
00:46:09.101 --> 00:46:10.592
like when you approached the expression was like,

1137
00:46:10.592 --> 00:46:12.108
what the?

1138
00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:15.246
(as Dezran Thain) "But nevertheless, it is a pleasure

1139
00:46:15.246 --> 00:46:17.429
"to meet you, Mighty Nein.

1140
00:46:19.488 --> 00:46:22.166
"I apologize. I must be off," and the Martinet says--

1141
00:46:22.166 --> 00:46:26.090
TALIESIN: Are you going to be joining us for the voyage?

1142
00:46:26.090 --> 00:46:29.060
MATT: "No, I will be staying here
with my home in Nicodranas,

1143
00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:32.077
"but I wish you all luck on the journey,

1144
00:46:34.194 --> 00:46:35.120
"Have a good day."

1145
00:46:35.120 --> 00:46:38.203
ASHLEY: How do you get your hair so pointy?

1146
00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:42.188
MATT: And as he casts Prestidigitation,

1147
00:46:42.188 --> 00:46:44.096
you watch the hair continue to

1148
00:46:44.096 --> 00:46:47.460
find a majestic spire

1149
00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:49.260
seemingly almost pointing southward.

1150
00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:53.080
MARISHA: While Yasha does that and he's distracted,

1151
00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:54.540
can I case him a little bit?

1152
00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:57.370
Can I do, like, a once over?

1153
00:46:57.370 --> 00:46:59.882
MATT: Okay, what are you trying to discern?

1154
00:47:02.357 --> 00:47:03.190
MARISHA: I want to discern...

1155
00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:05.031
LAURA: How firm is buttocks are?

1156
00:47:05.031 --> 00:47:06.231
[laughter]

1157
00:47:06.231 --> 00:47:07.641
TALIESIN: Buttress.

1158
00:47:07.641 --> 00:47:10.370
MARISHA: I want to see if he's hiding anything on his belt.

1159
00:47:10.370 --> 00:47:12.409
If he looks like he has any papers or anything.

1160
00:47:12.409 --> 00:47:13.242
MATT: Sure, go ahead.

1161
00:47:13.242 --> 00:47:14.577
MARISHA: A weapon or something like that.

1162
00:47:14.577 --> 00:47:16.140
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check for me.

1163
00:47:16.140 --> 00:47:18.810
LAURA: I'm going to look at his butt while she's doing that.

1164
00:47:18.810 --> 00:47:20.701
MATT: Make a perception check for me.

1165
00:47:20.701 --> 00:47:21.752
[laughter]

1166
00:47:21.752 --> 00:47:23.026
TRAVIS: Roll better.
MARISHA: Balls.

1167
00:47:23.026 --> 00:47:24.951
TRAVIS: Roll better.
MARISHA: Balls eater!

1168
00:47:24.951 --> 00:47:26.980
TRAVIS: Roll better.

1169
00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:29.446
MARISHA: Eight.
LAURA: Eight!

1170
00:47:29.446 --> 00:47:31.446
MATT: Oh-oh.
MARISHA: Eight.

1171
00:47:32.933 --> 00:47:35.491
MATT: You both find the butt.

1172
00:47:35.491 --> 00:47:37.800
[laughter]

1173
00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:40.670
MARISHA: I just look at Jester.

1174
00:47:40.670 --> 00:47:41.870
MATT: It's not a bad butt,

1175
00:47:41.870 --> 00:47:45.320
but that's about all you discern.

1176
00:47:46.698 --> 00:47:47.640
The Martinet goes,

1177
00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:52.500
"Of course, Dezran, we will see you tomorrow.

1178
00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:54.620
"When is the actual event

1179
00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:56.148
"happening, if you don't mind me requesting?

1180
00:47:56.148 --> 00:47:57.606
And the Lord Athesius goes,

1181
00:47:57.606 --> 00:48:01.055
"Oh yes, actually, if you're interested in coming at all,

1182
00:48:01.055 --> 00:48:02.540
"there is an event,

1183
00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:05.172
"a party that is to happen.

"This is in two nights from now before we head out,

00:48:10.410 --> 00:48:11.600
"if you're interested.

00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:13.660
"We'd love to have such esteemed individuals

"who are saving the world around here

1188

"and the Martinet has spoken of you, I believe, previously.

1189
00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:21.108
"So if you'd like to come

1190
00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:25.360
"the actual information regarding this is

1191
00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:29.443
"at the Marquis Zaif's Demesne,"

1192
00:48:29.443 --> 00:48:30.752
which <i>you</i> know.

1193
00:48:30.752 --> 00:48:33.820
That's the Marquis of Nicodranas.

1194
00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:37.227
His demesne is this small palace in the Opal Archways.

1195
00:48:37.227 --> 00:48:39.784
That's not far from where your mother works.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, that's, like, a really fancy house.

1196
00:48:39.784 --> 00:48:42.570
MATT: It's super fancy and it's where largely all the major

1197
00:48:42.570 --> 00:48:45.270
diplomatic events and parties happen within Nicodranas

1198
00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:48.930
and where a lot of the political business between the Empire

1199
00:48:48.930 --> 00:48:51.600
and the Concord tend to happen at Zaif's home.

1200
00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:54.340
LAURA: Yeah, I think Mama got asked to perform

1201
00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:55.710
there one time at a party,

1202
00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:58.600
but she didn't end up accepting.

1203
00:48:58.600 --> 00:48:59.747
TRAVIS: Why not?

1204
00:48:59.747 --> 00:49:01.990
LAURA: She didn't want to--

1205
00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:04.550
MATT: (as Lord Athesius) "Who is your mother, then?"

1206
00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:07.170
LAURA: The Ruby of Sea.

1207
00:49:07.170 --> 00:49:08.780
TALIESIN: Insight check, what was that look?

1208
00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:09.963
MATT: Make an insight check.

1209
00:49:09.963 --> 00:49:12.963
[laughter, cheering]

1210
00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:16.353
TALIESIN: 23.

1211
00:49:16.353 --> 00:49:18.161
MARISHA: Whoa.
LAURA: Woo!

1212
00:49:20.308 --> 00:49:22.260
MATT: That is a look of immediate recognition

1213
00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:23.710
and then a person immediately falling

1214
00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:25.468
into a series of fond memories.

1215
00:49:25.468 --> 00:49:26.993
TALIESIN: Okay.
SAM: Ooh.

1216
00:49:27.870 --> 00:49:30.903
MATT: "I am quite familiar with your mother.

1217
00:49:30.903 --> 00:49:32.986
[laughter]

1218
00:49:32.986 --> 00:49:36.653
"She is a brilliant performer and I'm--

1219
00:49:36.653 --> 00:49:38.880
"She was never, I believe, denied an invitation."

1220
00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:40.330
LAURA: Oh, no, no, she was asked to go,

1221
00:49:40.330 --> 00:49:42.750
she just was unable to attend.

1222
00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:45.266
MATT: "Then I apologize that our

1223
00:49:45.266 --> 00:49:47.500
"personage does not meet her standard."

1224
00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:49.175
LAURA: Not at all, no.

1225
00:49:49.175 --> 00:49:50.008
MATT: "Beyond myself, of course."

1226
00:49:50.008 --> 00:49:52.141
LAURA: She was very ill and so she wasn't

1227
00:49:52.141 --> 00:49:53.765
able to leave at that time.

1228
00:49:53.765 --> 00:49:55.465
MATT: "Well, if she would like to come and perform

1229
00:49:55.465 --> 00:49:57.960
"perhaps for this event that my cousin is holding,

00:49:57.960 --> 00:49:58.927
"that would be wonderful."

1231
00:49:58.927 --> 00:50:00.518
MARISHA: No, Jester's just being nice.

1232
00:50:00.518 --> 00:50:01.550
It's about the standards.

1233
00:50:01.550 --> 00:50:02.741
LAURA: No, it's not, no!

1234
00:50:02.741 --> 00:50:04.738
[laughter]

1235
00:50:04.738 --> 00:50:06.547
It's really not.

1236
00:50:06.547 --> 00:50:07.380
No, my mama, she--

1237
00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:09.990
MATT: "Oh, I'm not offended. My cousin is a dead dog,

1238
00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:14.247
"but, I mean, I've been by the Chateau myself

1239
00:50:14.247 --> 00:50:15.080
"a number of times.

1240
00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:16.680
"She is a wonderful woman.

1241
00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:17.579
"It is a pleasure to meet you."

1242
00:50:17.579 --> 00:50:18.412
LAURA: You too.

1243
00:50:18.412 --> 00:50:19.990
MATT: Gives you a kiss on the fingers.

1244
00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:23.200
LIAM: How far are we from the docks where we are?

1245
00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:26.629
MATT: Oh, you guys are, like, out on

1246
00:50:26.629 --> 00:50:28.178
the wharf docks themselves,

1247
00:50:28.178 --> 00:50:29.295
and you're on the ship

1248
00:50:29.295 --> 00:50:31.275
as it's set there in the harbor.

1249
00:50:31.275 --> 00:50:35.090
LIAM: Are we close-ish from where we are to the docks?

1250
00:50:35.090 --> 00:50:37.005
MATT: You're, I'd say walking on the docks,

1251
00:50:37.005 --> 00:50:39.213
you're probably a good 80 or so

1252
00:50:39.213 --> 00:50:41.121
to a hundred feet away from the shore.

1253
00:50:41.121 --> 00:50:42.370
LIAM: Away from the shore.

1254
00:50:42.370 --> 00:50:44.693
But are we onboard the boat or are we--

1255
00:50:44.693 --> 00:50:45.842
MATT: You're on the deck of the boat.
LIAM: Okay.

1256
00:50:45.842 --> 00:50:48.950
Would I be able to summon Frumpkin the monkey

1257
00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:51.550
on the docks, not on the boat,

1258
00:50:51.550 --> 00:50:54.640
maybe behind some schmutz there?

1259
00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:55.860
LIAM: Sure.

1260
00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:59.650
As you begin, I assume there's somatic components

1261
00:50:59.650 --> 00:51:01.660
to this as well as verbal.

1262
00:51:02.810 --> 00:51:05.200
LIAM: Yeah well, summoning him for the first time,

1263
00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:07.912
but I don't know about bringing him in and out.

1264
00:51:07.912 --> 00:51:08.745
MATT: Just an action?

1265
00:51:08.745 --> 00:51:10.320
LIAM: Yeah.

1266
00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:11.311
MATT: If you just bamfed him out

1267
00:51:11.311 --> 00:51:12.900
and then I'd say you're fine.

1268
00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:14.375
LIAM: Okay.
MATT: So yeah, you can definitely do that.

1269
00:51:14.375 --> 00:51:17.760
LIAM: Okay, so he is sitting behind a crate

1270
00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:21.926
or some other sort of shipping stuff on the dock.

1271
00:51:21.926 --> 00:51:22.858
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: Okay.

1272
00:51:22.858 --> 00:51:25.020
MATT: All right.

1273
00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:29.120
Ludinus looks towards Dezran and goes,

1274
00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:31.450
"Actually, Dezran, if we could have a conversation

1275
00:51:31.450 --> 00:51:34.472
"before you leave, that would be wonderful.

1276
00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:39.192
"And if you will attend, I think that would be

1277
00:51:39.192 --> 00:51:41.275
"a glorious event to introduce you to some of

1278
00:51:41.275 --> 00:51:43.224
"the more important figures that are going to be

1279
00:51:43.224 --> 00:51:44.399
"part of this negotiation,

1280
00:51:44.399 --> 00:51:48.130
"as well as the local society here in Nicodranas."

1281
00:51:48.130 --> 00:51:52.400
LIAM: That is an excellent idea.
We want to become more familiar

1282
00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:54.320
with each other before we set out.

1283
00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:55.153
MATT: "Of course."

1284
00:51:55.153 --> 00:51:55.986
LIAM: We are going to be working together.

1285
00:51:55.986 --> 00:51:57.890
It is going to be wonderful.

1286
00:51:57.890 --> 00:52:01.224
MATT: "What is your means of transportation?

1287
00:52:01.224 --> 00:52:04.260
"I apologize there is not room for more passengers."

1288
00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:06.390
LAURA: Oh, we've got our own ship. It's really fancy.

1289
00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:08.170
Don't you worry about us.

1290
00:52:08.170 --> 00:52:10.470
MATT: "All right. If I might have the name of the ship

1291
00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:11.636
"to ensure that is"

1292
00:52:11.636 --> 00:52:13.778
[laughter]

1293
00:52:13.778 --> 00:52:15.300
"approval from the Wharfmaster."

1294
00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:16.800
SAM: We traveled by ball.

1295
00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:21.320
LAURA: Captain, would you-- you can introduce your ship.

1296
00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:22.880
I know it's a place of great pride for you.

1297
00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:24.650
MATT: "You're the captain of the ship?

1298
00:52:24.650 --> 00:52:27.710
"Oh, so you've traveled the Lucidian Ocean quite

1299
00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:29.710
"a bit, I see. Impressive."

1300
00:52:29.710 --> 00:52:31.210
TRAVIS: Yep. Yeah.

1301
00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:36.303
Grand vessel by the name of the Ball-- (mumbling)

1302
00:52:36.303 --> 00:52:38.361
[laughter]

1303
00:52:38.361 --> 00:52:39.744
MATT: All three of them look at each other.

1304
00:52:39.744 --> 00:52:40.919
"I'm terribly sorry, I did not catch that.

1305
00:52:40.919 --> 00:52:42.280
"What was the name again?"

1306
00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:44.407
TRAVIS: Oh, I'm so sorry it was the Ball--

1307
00:52:44.407 --> 00:52:46.640
[laughter]

1308
00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:48.239
MATT: "I'm afraid you're sneezing mid-sentence.

1309
00:52:48.239 --> 00:52:49.089
"I'm not catching the final--"

1310
00:52:49.089 --> 00:52:51.297
TRAVIS: (loudly) The Balleater.

1311
00:52:51.297 --> 00:52:53.631
(laughter)

1312
00:52:53.631 --> 00:52:57.789
[cheering]

1313
00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:01.801
MATT: The silence hangs.

1314
00:53:01.801 --> 00:53:03.684
[laughter]

1315
00:53:03.684 --> 00:53:08.217
As a gentle ocean wind

1316
00:53:08.217 --> 00:53:10.117
blows through.

1317
00:53:10.117 --> 00:53:12.441
TALIESIN: A wind of Aeons, maybe?

1318
00:53:12.441 --> 00:53:14.691
[laughter]

1319
00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:18.985
LIAM: Martinet, there is no man alive

1320
00:53:18.985 --> 00:53:23.070
who knows more about the sea and ships specifically

1321
00:53:23.070 --> 00:53:25.200
than this man before you.

1322
00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:27.910
(laughter)

1323
00:53:27.910 --> 00:53:29.826
ASHLEY: You should quiz him.

1324
00:53:29.826 --> 00:53:32.850
(laughter)

1325
00:53:32.850 --> 00:53:37.275
[laughter]

1326
00:53:40.120 --> 00:53:44.798
The sailing terms that he knows is really spectacular.

1327
00:53:44.798 --> 00:53:47.191
TRAVIS: You know what, I think
I ate something that disagreed with me.

1328
00:53:47.191 --> 00:53:48.857
I'm going to just-- If you don't--

1329
00:53:48.857 --> 00:53:51.057
Pardon me. And I walk off the ship.

1330
00:53:51.057 --> 00:53:54.060
[laughter]

1331
00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:57.630
MATT: Lord Athesius follows you and goes,

1332
00:53:57.630 --> 00:53:58.780
"Do not worry, friends,

1333
00:53:58.780 --> 00:54:00.160
"but please do come.

1334
00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:01.400
"It would be a pleasure to have you

1335
00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:04.640
"and to introduce you to the delights of Nicodranas."

1336
00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:06.565
LAURA: I would love to to do a party.

1337
00:54:06.565 --> 00:54:07.910
MATT: "Wonderful."
SAM: Two nights from now, then?

1338
00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:09.730
MATT: "Yes, tomorrow night."

1339
00:54:09.730 --> 00:54:11.355
LAURA: Tomorrow night?! Oh man.

1340
00:54:11.355 --> 00:54:12.804
MATT: That would be two nights from now.

1341
00:54:12.804 --> 00:54:14.812
SAM: Oh, like tonight and tomorrow.

1342
00:54:14.812 --> 00:54:17.548
MARISHA: Tonight and tomorrow. Okay. Ehh.

1343
00:54:17.548 --> 00:54:18.381
LAURA: That makes sense.

1344
00:54:18.381 --> 00:54:19.214
SAM: Not really.

1345
00:54:19.214 --> 00:54:20.900
LAURA: Do we just show up or are we on the list?

1346
00:54:20.900 --> 00:54:23.443
Do we need to bring an invite or what? How does--

1347
00:54:23.443 --> 00:54:25.484
MATT: "I'll go ahead and ensures that the doorman

1348
00:54:25.484 --> 00:54:28.750
"is aware of your arrival and what to look for."

1349
00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:29.650
LAURA: Okay.

1350
00:54:29.650 --> 00:54:31.190
MATT: "Dress nicely, please."

1351
00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:36.190
LIAM: Now is probably a good time to state that

1352
00:54:38.880 --> 00:54:42.330
the Bright Queen, who we are here on behalf of,

1353
00:54:42.330 --> 00:54:44.113
has requested that we inspect

1354
00:54:44.113 --> 00:54:46.404
the artifact in question

1355
00:54:46.404 --> 00:54:48.129
before setting sail

1356
00:54:48.129 --> 00:54:50.712
to make sure that it is intact.

1357
00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:54.398
MATT: (as Ludinus) "That can certainly be arranged."

1358
00:54:54.398 --> 00:54:56.340
Caduceus, you notice that

1359
00:54:56.340 --> 00:55:00.173
Dezran's eyes dart back and forth a bit.

1360
00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:04.970
"Certainly. Immediately before the end of the voyage,

1361
00:55:04.970 --> 00:55:07.360
"we'll be happy to allow you a moment

1362
00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:09.210
"to inspect the artifact."

1363
00:55:09.210 --> 00:55:11.940
LIAM: I was hoping to look at it maybe before the party.

1364
00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:14.860
MATT: "Perhaps tomorrow midday?"

1365
00:55:16.570 --> 00:55:17.403
LIAM: Fair enough.

1366
00:55:17.403 --> 00:55:18.600
LAURA: Why can't we look at it now?

1367
00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:19.433
MATT: "It's not currently on this ship

1368
00:55:19.433 --> 00:55:22.558
"and it's in the process of being prepared for the journey."

1369
00:55:22.558 --> 00:55:24.740
TALIESIN: Before we set sail at the very least.

1370
00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:25.598
MATT: "Not to worry.

1371
00:55:25.598 --> 00:55:27.410
"It'll be provided, I promise."

1372
00:55:27.410 --> 00:55:28.410
TALIESIN: All right.

1373
00:55:29.965 --> 00:55:31.950
MATT: "All right, well good luck.

1374
00:55:31.950 --> 00:55:33.783
"Enjoy your preparation

1375
00:55:34.742 --> 00:55:36.565
"and safe voyage to all of you."

1376
00:55:36.565 --> 00:55:39.030
LAURA: Can I insight check him based on what he said about

1377
00:55:39.030 --> 00:55:41.520
preparing it and not being on the ship and all that shit.

1378
00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:44.360
MATT: Sure, go ahead and make an insight check.

1379
00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:45.809
SAM: Come on, come on.

1380
00:55:45.809 --> 00:55:47.044
LIAM: Get it, girl.

1381
00:55:47.044 --> 00:55:49.453
LIAM: (squealing) Oh, that's five.

1382
00:55:49.453 --> 00:55:51.590
Okay, 13.

1383
00:55:51.590 --> 00:55:53.256
MATT: 13.
TRAVIS: 2013.

1384
00:55:53.256 --> 00:55:55.480
LAURA: 2013.

1385
00:55:57.420 --> 00:55:58.253
MATT: Much better year.

1386
00:55:58.253 --> 00:56:01.119
(laughter)

1387
00:56:01.119 --> 00:56:02.885
LIAM and MATT: (resigned sigh)

1388
00:56:04.987 --> 00:56:07.720
MATT: Long for the simpler days.

1389
00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:11.845
So, yes, he seems upfront and honest

1390
00:56:11.845 --> 00:56:12.840
as best as you can tell.

1391
00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:14.962
He's hard to read in general,

1392
00:56:14.962 --> 00:56:19.379
but there's no signs of any sort of

1393
00:56:19.379 --> 00:56:20.700
deviousness or deception.

1394
00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:21.533
LAURA: Okay.

1395
00:56:24.030 --> 00:56:27.380
MATT: But "Enjoy and if you require anything,

1396
00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:29.850
"I believe you can just let me know,"

1397
00:56:29.850 --> 00:56:31.458
and looks towards you, Jester.

1398
00:56:31.458 --> 00:56:32.366
SAM: Toodles.

1399
00:56:32.366 --> 00:56:34.522
TALIESIN: Most gracious.

1400
00:56:34.522 --> 00:56:38.220
MATT: "Dezran," and the two of them leave below deck.

1401
00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:39.380
What would you like to do?

1402
00:56:39.380 --> 00:56:41.065
LIAM: Where did Thain go?

1403
00:56:41.065 --> 00:56:44.340
Thain went below deck with the Martinet.
LIAM: All right.

1404
00:56:44.340 --> 00:56:46.990
While we're standing there, I telepathically

1405
00:56:46.990 --> 00:56:49.430
tell Frumpkin to keep an eye on the boat

1406
00:56:49.430 --> 00:56:51.170
and keep an eye out for Thain

1407
00:56:51.170 --> 00:56:53.755
and to follow Thain around town.

1408
00:56:53.755 --> 00:56:55.880
MARISHA: Does this boat have, like,

1409
00:56:55.880 --> 00:56:58.830
porthole windows or anything like that?

1410
00:56:58.830 --> 00:57:02.510
MATT: It looks like there are a few wooden,

1411
00:57:02.510 --> 00:57:06.293
window elements for a gun deck,

1412
00:57:06.293 --> 00:57:07.497
though you're unsure if it's outfitted.

1413
00:57:07.497 --> 00:57:08.330
They are currently closed,

1414
00:57:08.330 --> 00:57:12.821
but they are currently designed to be opened.

1415
00:57:12.821 --> 00:57:15.590
MARISHA: I don't want to be in earshot.

1416
00:57:15.590 --> 00:57:18.020
So as we step away, I don't want to be by guards.

1417
00:57:18.020 --> 00:57:19.850
MATT: Okay, so you move a bit past the guards

1418
00:57:19.850 --> 00:57:21.890
and you're now back onto the dock.

1419
00:57:21.890 --> 00:57:24.380
Probably a good 40, 50 feet from where they were standing.

1420
00:57:24.380 --> 00:57:25.213
MARISHA: Caleb.

1421
00:57:25.213 --> 00:57:26.063
LIAM: Yeah.

1422
00:57:26.063 --> 00:57:29.190
MARISHA: I want to know that conversation.

1423
00:57:29.190 --> 00:57:31.677
I want to know what's being said.

1424
00:57:31.677 --> 00:57:33.270
Think you can get Frumpkin in there?

1425
00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:35.900
Or at least over in these canon docks over there.

1426
00:57:35.900 --> 00:57:36.750
You see what I'm,

1427
00:57:36.750 --> 00:57:38.830
here look at my eye line.

1428
00:57:38.830 --> 00:57:40.710
Look down, you see that?

1429
00:57:40.710 --> 00:57:43.080
And you see how there might be, like, a little opening

1430
00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:45.020
that maybe Frumpkin can get in.

1431
00:57:45.020 --> 00:57:47.180
LIAM: Yeah, my cat could probably climb over there

1432
00:57:47.180 --> 00:57:49.113
and open it up with his little

1433
00:57:49.113 --> 00:57:51.870
cat monkey paws.
MARISHA: He's got little monkey hands, yeah.

1434
00:57:51.870 --> 00:57:53.030
I want to know what's being said, man.

1435
00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:54.540
TRAVIS: Is it a cat or a monkey?

1436
00:57:54.540 --> 00:57:55.650
LIAM: It's a cat.

1437
00:57:55.650 --> 00:57:57.380
LAURA: He's just in the shape of a monkey.

1438
00:57:57.380 --> 00:57:58.213
MARISHA: He's a Frumpkey.

1439
00:57:58.213 --> 00:57:59.454
ASHLEY: What?

1440
00:57:59.454 --> 00:58:02.779
[laughter]

1441
00:58:02.779 --> 00:58:03.995
MARISHA: Can you do it?

1442
00:58:03.995 --> 00:58:06.756
LAURA: (laughter) Yeah.

1443
00:58:06.756 --> 00:58:11.250
LIAM: All right, well, let's get away from the boat.

1444
00:58:11.250 --> 00:58:12.083
MARISHA: All right.

1445
00:58:12.083 --> 00:58:12.916
LAURA: Hey, Caleb.

1446
00:58:12.916 --> 00:58:15.230
I step away from the rest of the group

1447
00:58:15.230 --> 00:58:17.021
and whisper to Caleb.

1448
00:58:17.021 --> 00:58:18.704
You know what you could do?
LIAM: What?

1449
00:58:18.704 --> 00:58:21.660
LAURA: You could let Nott eat Frumpkin tonight.

1450
00:58:21.660 --> 00:58:24.660
[laughter]

1451
00:58:31.844 --> 00:58:33.509
LIAM: That's a lot to process.

1452
00:58:33.509 --> 00:58:36.140
[laughter]

1453
00:58:36.140 --> 00:58:37.631
LAURA: Just because, you know,

1454
00:58:37.631 --> 00:58:40.047
you can bring him back really easy

1455
00:58:40.047 --> 00:58:41.506
and Nott what they really appreciate

1456
00:58:41.506 --> 00:58:42.750
getting to eat a monkey.

1457
00:58:42.750 --> 00:58:47.750
LIAM: I mean, just from a flavor and culinary angle,

1458
00:58:47.850 --> 00:58:50.550
I am not sure he tastes the way

1459
00:58:51.740 --> 00:58:54.160
Nott is accustomed cat tasting.

1460
00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:56.418
LAURA: Well, I remember you saying that

1461
00:58:56.418 --> 00:58:58.630
Nott used to try to eat Frumpkin all the time.

1462
00:58:58.630 --> 00:59:01.177
LIAM: Yeah, but she was never satisfied.

1463
00:59:01.177 --> 00:59:02.010
LAURA: Oh.

1464
00:59:02.010 --> 00:59:03.600
TRAVIS: Yeah, and also there's not much to eat, right?

1465
00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:05.955
I mean, Frumpkin doesn't have that much health.

1466
00:59:05.955 --> 00:59:08.513
You just take a bite and it's like, (poofing)

1467
00:59:08.513 --> 00:59:09.680
LAURA: That's true.

1468
00:59:11.446 --> 00:59:13.440
That's a good point, Fjord.

1469
00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:17.598
LIAM: My cat is as healthy as any fucking cat

1470
00:59:18.730 --> 00:59:21.130
in the Empire or Nicodranas or anywhere.

1471
00:59:21.130 --> 00:59:22.290
MARISHA: You want to test that?

1472
00:59:24.110 --> 00:59:25.693
LIAM: Well, he's not a tarrasque,

1473
00:59:25.693 --> 00:59:28.740
but for cats, he's pretty good.

1474
00:59:28.740 --> 00:59:31.350
MARISHA: Can you get your monkey cat into the cannon?

1475
00:59:31.350 --> 00:59:32.590
LIAM: He's already going.
MARISHA: To hear this--

1476
00:59:32.590 --> 00:59:34.070
Okay.

1477
00:59:34.070 --> 00:59:37.653
LIAM: So I've told Frumpkin to try to,

1478
00:59:37.653 --> 00:59:40.094
monkey along underneath the gangplank

1479
00:59:40.094 --> 00:59:42.900
and try to find his way over to the porthole.

1480
00:59:42.900 --> 00:59:43.733
TRAVIS: Can we be walking away

1481
00:59:43.733 --> 00:59:46.085
at the same time as these shenanigans?

1482
00:59:46.085 --> 00:59:49.158
LAURA: So we're not staring at the boat as it's happening.

1483
00:59:49.158 --> 00:59:52.940
MATT: Completely inconspicuously slow walking away.

1484
00:59:52.940 --> 00:59:56.890
LIAM: Yeah just, Jester, tie your shoe about 90 feet

1485
00:59:56.890 --> 00:59:58.640
away from the side of the boat.

1486
00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:00.606
LAURA: Okay, tell me when.

1487
01:00:00.606 --> 01:00:01.950
Is this 90 feet?
LIAM: Now.

1488
01:00:01.950 --> 01:00:03.400
LAURA: Okay.

1489
01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:05.958
TALIESIN: Is anybody watching us or following us,

1490
01:00:05.958 --> 01:00:07.560
or are we being...

1491
01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:10.510
MATT: No. I mean, the guards are watching you leave,

1492
01:00:10.510 --> 01:00:13.630
but they're not, like, intensely casing you.

1493
01:00:13.630 --> 01:00:16.450
TALIESIN: Anybody even just following us.

1494
01:00:16.450 --> 01:00:19.640
Just, I want to keep an eye on for a tail the next hour.

1495
01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:22.080
MATT: Okay, keeping an eye out, no worries.

1496
01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:24.290
Okay, if you could go ahead and roll

1497
01:00:24.290 --> 01:00:27.082
a stealth check for Frumpkin, as a monkey.

1498
01:00:27.082 --> 01:00:28.107
MARISHA: Come on.

1499
01:00:28.107 --> 01:00:28.940
LAURA: Come on.

1500
01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:31.370
LIAM: Frumpkin always fucks it up.

1501
01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:34.513
Ooh, good!

1502
01:00:36.219 --> 01:00:40.794
Oh, okay, I've got a baboon prepped for Frumpkin.

1503
01:00:40.794 --> 01:00:41.630
Hold on.

1504
01:00:41.630 --> 01:00:42.750
MATT: The stealthiest of creature.

1505
01:00:42.750 --> 01:00:44.217
LIAM: 18.

1506
01:00:44.217 --> 01:00:46.191
TALIESIN: Hey!
MATT: That's great!

1507
01:00:46.191 --> 01:00:47.828
TALIESIN: That's okay.

1508
01:00:47.828 --> 01:00:50.207
LAURA: He's actually a baboon?! I thought he was, like,

1509
01:00:50.207 --> 01:00:53.470
a teeny tiny little spider monkey.
LIAM: I just searched 5e monkey on Google.

1510
01:00:53.470 --> 01:00:56.098
That's what they taught me at Soltryce Academy.

1511
01:00:56.098 --> 01:00:58.805
(laughter)

1512
01:00:58.805 --> 01:01:02.300
LAURA: That huge, Caleb, a baboon is a really big.

1513
01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:03.460
MATT: Well, he's using the stats for the baboon.

1514
01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:05.735
LIAM: Well, I rolled 16.

1515
01:01:05.735 --> 01:01:06.568
MATT: All right.

1516
01:01:06.568 --> 01:01:10.187
LIAM: And baboon says plus two. So go with it, okay?

1517
01:01:12.190 --> 01:01:16.873
MATT: The Righteous Brand unaware, you can sense Frumpkin

1518
01:01:16.873 --> 01:01:19.473
complete the journey beneath the gangplank,

1519
01:01:19.473 --> 01:01:20.909
onto the edge of the ship

1520
01:01:20.909 --> 01:01:23.070
and then grasping onto the rougher edges

1521
01:01:23.070 --> 01:01:26.670
of the outside of the actual ship hull,

1522
01:01:26.670 --> 01:01:31.169
make his way to the edge of one of the gunship portholes,

1523
01:01:31.169 --> 01:01:34.682
slowly open it, and slip barely inside.

1524
01:01:34.682 --> 01:01:37.284
LIAM: I put my arm on Beauregard's shoulder and say:

1525
01:01:37.284 --> 01:01:41.283
Just look at the ocean, it is so beautiful. (whooshing)

1526
01:01:41.283 --> 01:01:46.217
MARISHA: What a beautiful sight to behold.

1527
01:01:47.307 --> 01:01:48.140
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1528
01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:49.307
MARISHA: So gorgeous.

1529
01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:51.773
TALIESIN: Wow.

1530
01:01:52.783 --> 01:01:55.783
(laughter)

1531
01:02:00.010 --> 01:02:01.750
LIAM: So blue.

1532
01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:03.133
MARISHA: Take it all in.

1533
01:02:03.133 --> 01:02:05.930
(whispering) What's he saying, can you hear anything?

1534
01:02:05.930 --> 01:02:07.655
MATT: Okay, so as--

1535
01:02:07.655 --> 01:02:10.605
LIAM: Don't forget that I cannot hear anything,

1536
01:02:10.605 --> 01:02:12.097
so if you try to talk to me

1537
01:02:12.097 --> 01:02:13.872
I can't hear you.
MATT: Okay, this'll be interesting.

1538
01:02:13.872 --> 01:02:15.354
MARISHA: Oh, fuck.

1539
01:02:16.246 --> 01:02:18.690
(laughter)

1540
01:02:18.690 --> 01:02:20.690
MATT: Focusing through Frumpkin eyes,

1541
01:02:20.690 --> 01:02:25.150
you look into the interior of this darkened

1542
01:02:25.150 --> 01:02:26.600
gun deck of the ship.

1543
01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:30.650
There are two cannons within there as opposed,

1544
01:02:30.650 --> 01:02:32.580
it looks like it was built for multiple canons,

1545
01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:35.680
but there's only two in there very beautiful make,

1546
01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:37.120
and immediately just at a glance,

1547
01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:39.350
you can see these are not standard cannonball based canons.

1548
01:02:39.350 --> 01:02:41.230
These are arcane in nature,

1549
01:02:41.230 --> 01:02:44.313
and who knows what they're capable of when fired.

1550
01:02:45.195 --> 01:02:48.430
It is very dark and you watch two figures

1551
01:02:48.430 --> 01:02:50.832
waltz in with haste.

1552
01:02:52.302 --> 01:02:56.100
You hear one voice, Ludinus, say

1553
01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:57.433
"I couldn't help but gauge

1554
01:02:57.433 --> 01:03:00.880
"your discomfort with the conversation."

1555
01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:02.973
And the other figure goes,

1556
01:03:04.210 --> 01:03:06.180
"Well, I just wasn't expecting to see them."

1557
01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:09.360
And Ludinus goes, "Shh, hold on,"

1558
01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:11.277
does some hand motions.

1559
01:03:12.135 --> 01:03:14.498
As he releases a simple spell,

1560
01:03:14.498 --> 01:03:17.340
there's this faint shockwave, (explosion)

1561
01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:19.820
that dissipates within a radius of them.

1562
01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:22.830
Uncertain what it does. Though you gather, in the moment,

1563
01:03:22.830 --> 01:03:25.338
that it's probably some sort of a radial dispel

1564
01:03:25.338 --> 01:03:29.330
to lock down or destroy any localized magic.

1565
01:03:29.330 --> 01:03:32.754
However, the illusion around Lord Dezran Thain vanishes.

1566
01:03:32.754 --> 01:03:35.360
(gasping)

1567
01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:37.610
and there standing in his place

1568
01:03:37.610 --> 01:03:39.335
is a

1569
01:03:39.335 --> 01:03:40.943
gently floating

1570
01:03:40.943 --> 01:03:43.126
male drow

1571
01:03:43.126 --> 01:03:44.392
with short hair.

1572
01:03:44.392 --> 01:03:47.021
[shocked noises]

1573
01:03:47.021 --> 01:03:49.688
MARISHA: No.
LAURA: (gasping)

1574
01:03:52.478 --> 01:03:54.094
MARISHA: He's the traitor?

1575
01:03:54.094 --> 01:03:54.927
LAURA: He's the tra--

1576
01:03:54.927 --> 01:03:55.760
MARISHA: He's a mole?

1577
01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:57.385
TRAVIS: Shh, shh, shh.

1578
01:03:57.385 --> 01:03:59.440
[laughter]

1579
01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:02.256
SAM: So blue, so beautiful.

1580
01:04:02.256 --> 01:04:04.770
[laughter]

1581
01:04:04.770 --> 01:04:08.760
Look at it, the waves are so beautiful.

1582
01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:12.390
MATT: To which

1583
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:14.065
the revealed Essek responds.

1584
01:04:14.065 --> 01:04:16.662
(shocked gasping)
[screaming]

1585
01:04:18.845 --> 01:04:20.384
ASHLEY: No.

1586
01:04:20.384 --> 01:04:21.700
LAURA: Buddy, don't!

1587
01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:25.033
MATT: "Of course I'm uncomfortable with this.

1588
01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:29.597
"I did not know they were going to be coming directly here."

1589
01:04:30.748 --> 01:04:33.380
And you can see, there's conflict in his eyes,

1590
01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:36.440
and Ludinus goes, "I understand,

1591
01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:39.830
"but it's extremely important how we enforce

1592
01:04:39.830 --> 01:04:43.450
"and oversee the control and the exchange of the prisoners

1593
01:04:43.450 --> 01:04:46.417
"and the delivery of the beacon."

1594
01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:50.190
Essek thinks for a second,

1595
01:04:50.190 --> 01:04:51.506
"I agree."

1596
01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:56.530
Ludinus goes, "We each have what we want.

1597
01:04:56.530 --> 01:04:57.970
"And when this business is behind us,

1598
01:04:57.970 --> 01:05:01.395
"we need not interact ever again.

1599
01:05:01.395 --> 01:05:04.436
"The Assembly will share its research

1600
01:05:04.436 --> 01:05:07.350
"per the deal and beyond

1601
01:05:07.350 --> 01:05:09.720
"and we never have to speak."

1602
01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:11.770
And Essek sits and thinks for a second and goes,

1603
01:05:14.550 --> 01:05:17.817
"I look forward to never seeing your face again,

1604
01:05:19.530 --> 01:05:22.478
"but we're too far in at this point.

1605
01:05:23.390 --> 01:05:25.750
"It's taken a lot of effort to ensure the tracks

1606
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:28.000
"have been covered

1607
01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.392
"and no one undeserving was hurt.

1608
01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:36.870
"But I want no other part in this once this is done."

1609
01:05:36.870 --> 01:05:38.630
Ludinus steps forward and goes,

1610
01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:43.630
"I'm surprised to see such

1611
01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:48.515
"affection from such a previously cold individual."

1612
01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:52.925
And Essek turns his glance away and goes,

1613
01:05:52.925 --> 01:05:56.641
"Well, I am surprised myself.

1614
01:05:57.989 --> 01:06:00.419
"Maybe you should try friends sometime."

1615
01:06:00.419 --> 01:06:04.669
[awwing]

1616
01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:09.660
SAM: It's going to feel real bad when we kill him.

1617
01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:14.493
(laughter)

1618
01:06:14.493 --> 01:06:19.470
(laughter)

1619
01:06:19.470 --> 01:06:24.470
(laughter)

1620
01:06:24.876 --> 01:06:29.876
(laughter)

1621
01:06:30.219 --> 01:06:35.219
(laughter)

1622
01:06:35.228 --> 01:06:37.327
(laughter)

1623
01:06:37.327 --> 01:06:41.327
MATT: Ludinus goes, "Hold it together for time being.

1624
01:06:42.376 --> 01:06:43.942
"We cannot have you mysteriously disappearing

1625
01:06:43.942 --> 01:06:48.683
"with that poor attempt at hiding your discomfort earlier.

1626
01:06:48.683 --> 01:06:50.567
"Do your part,

1627
01:06:50.567 --> 01:06:53.234
"all right?" and Essek nods.

1628
01:06:56.247 --> 01:06:58.990
"(as Essek) (sighing) I hate parties,"

1629
01:06:58.990 --> 01:07:01.040
and turns around and you watch as the illusion

1630
01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:04.330
takes over once more as his feet touch the ground

1631
01:07:04.330 --> 01:07:07.580
and heads back out to the deck of the ship.

1632
01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:11.537
MARISHA: Man, look at the seagulls.

1633
01:07:11.537 --> 01:07:13.150
[laughter]

1634
01:07:13.150 --> 01:07:18.072
Just the pinnacle of beauty they are.

1635
01:07:20.530 --> 01:07:22.480
TRAVIS: You know what you're saying is actually worse

1636
01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:23.670
than if you were just commenting

1637
01:07:23.670 --> 01:07:27.425
on the ocean, making more suspicious.

1638
01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:30.480
MARISHA: These are genuine comments.

1639
01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:31.313
[laughter]

1640
01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:36.620
LIAM: So if Frumpkin peeks back out of the porthole

1641
01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:39.744
that he crawled into, is this...

1642
01:07:39.744 --> 01:07:42.586
friend of ours leaving the ship?

1643
01:07:42.586 --> 01:07:43.930
MATT: Yes.

1644
01:07:43.930 --> 01:07:48.180
LIAM: I send Frumpkin to follow him at a distance.

1645
01:07:48.180 --> 01:07:49.830
MATT: All right.

1646
01:07:49.830 --> 01:07:51.946
As you guys are walking away from the docks,

1647
01:07:51.946 --> 01:07:54.270
you hear the footfalls quickly approaching

1648
01:07:54.270 --> 01:07:57.611
of the Lord Dezran Thain,

1649
01:07:57.611 --> 01:08:00.660
who gives a nod.

1650
01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:02.101
"(throat clear) Hello."

1651
01:08:02.101 --> 01:08:04.538
LAURA: Oh, hey again.
TALIESIN: Hey.

1652
01:08:04.538 --> 01:08:06.010
MATT: "Have a good day and--"

1653
01:08:06.010 --> 01:08:07.140
LAURA: See you at the party.

1654
01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:08.806
TRAVIS: See you tomorrow night.

1655
01:08:08.806 --> 01:08:10.160
MATT: "Yes, indeed see you then."

1656
01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:13.260
LIAM: Pleasure meeting you.

1657
01:08:13.260 --> 01:08:14.835
MATT: "You as well (throat clear),"

1658
01:08:14.835 --> 01:08:17.068
and continues on past you with a hurried pace.

1659
01:08:17.068 --> 01:08:20.720
LAURA: If you feel like visiting the Lavish Chateau,

1660
01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:24.620
you can go there and see my mama perform.

1661
01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:26.420
MATT: No response.

1662
01:08:28.660 --> 01:08:29.510
TRAVIS: Well?

1663
01:08:29.510 --> 01:08:32.443
TALIESIN: So are we walking now or definitely away from--

1664
01:08:32.443 --> 01:08:34.130
MARISHA: Yep, no, let's walk and talk.

1665
01:08:34.130 --> 01:08:36.540
TALIESIN: So, I don't normally say this, but man,

1666
01:08:36.540 --> 01:08:39.900
I have not seen such an untrustworthy group of people

1667
01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:41.683
as far as I can remember.

1668
01:08:41.683 --> 01:08:43.120
There were some shifty people on there.

1669
01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:45.287
TRAVIS: Oh god, I thought you were
talking about us for one second.

1670
01:08:45.287 --> 01:08:48.240
[laughter]

1671
01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:51.520
TALIESIN: I mean, normally that'd be fair, but yeah.

1672
01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:53.270
That was,

1673
01:08:53.270 --> 01:08:55.700
everybody was very nervous.

1674
01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:57.300
LIAM: You know, perhaps it would be a good time

1675
01:08:57.300 --> 01:09:00.090
to stop back at the Balleater.

1676
01:09:00.090 --> 01:09:01.110
MARISHA: All right.

1677
01:09:01.110 --> 01:09:02.477
TRAVIS: Back to the ship now?

1678
01:09:02.477 --> 01:09:04.457
LIAM: Yeah.
MARISHA: Did you get something?

1679
01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:10.280
LIAM: I just have a hankering to
examine the ship top to bottom.

1680
01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:12.280
Make sure that it's in working order.

1681
01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:13.821
MARISHA: All right.

1682
01:09:13.821 --> 01:09:15.338
SAM: Sure.

1683
01:09:15.338 --> 01:09:19.688
TRAVIS: All right, let's go inspect the ship again?

1684
01:09:21.215 --> 01:09:23.170
We'll head back to the Balleater.

1685
01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:26.930
MATT: All right, you guys make your way back to the Balleater

1686
01:09:26.930 --> 01:09:29.160
and you see Marius LePual is there in the process

1687
01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:33.560
of tying one of the sails back up onto the main mast

1688
01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:35.620
and glances over and goes, "Ah, back so soon?"

1689
01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:37.294
TRAVIS: Have you killed anyone yet?

1690
01:09:37.294 --> 01:09:40.294
[laughter]

1691
01:09:41.313 --> 01:09:42.605
MATT: "(sighs)"

1692
01:09:42.605 --> 01:09:45.330
He grudgingly begins to pull a shortsword.

1693
01:09:46.478 --> 01:09:50.296
TRAVIS: Well, speak to Yasha, she's very disappointed.

1694
01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:53.763
We'll be a below decks if you need us.

1695
01:09:53.763 --> 01:09:56.480
LIAM: Yeah, the captain would like to inspect his quarters.

1696
01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:57.313
MATT: "Of course, of course.

1697
01:09:57.313 --> 01:09:58.588
"I was just kidding about the shortsword.

1698
01:09:58.588 --> 01:10:01.031
"You're kidding about the killing part, right?"

1699
01:10:01.031 --> 01:10:02.531
TRAVIS: Do I look like, I'm kidding?

1700
01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:06.086
ASHLEY: You had, like, 20 whole minutes.

1701
01:10:06.086 --> 01:10:09.086
[laughter]

1702
01:10:13.830 --> 01:10:15.413
MATT: "Aye aye, captain."

1703
01:10:17.730 --> 01:10:20.980
LIAM: Better get ready for the week, Marius.

1704
01:10:22.809 --> 01:10:27.784
MATT: "Whoa, okay, Mighty Nein's back."

1705
01:10:27.784 --> 01:10:29.343
TRAVIS: And Marius?
MATT: "Yes?"

1706
01:10:29.343 --> 01:10:30.930
TRAVIS: Don't get caught.

1707
01:10:30.930 --> 01:10:33.930
[laughter]

1708
01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:40.450
MATT: "You're hazing me, right, like, you're not serious."

1709
01:10:41.410 --> 01:10:43.285
TRAVIS: Of course not.

1710
01:10:43.285 --> 01:10:46.643
MATT: "Aw. (relieved chuckling)"

1711
01:10:46.643 --> 01:10:48.476
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're serious.

1712
01:10:49.525 --> 01:10:51.358
No, we're not serious.

1713
01:10:53.767 --> 01:10:54.942
MATT: "I'm going to get a drink,"

1714
01:10:54.942 --> 01:10:57.860
and he just heads right into the Restless Wharf.

1715
01:10:59.063 --> 01:11:00.280
TALIESIN: Oh man.

1716
01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:01.450
TRAVIS: Below decks?

1717
01:11:01.450 --> 01:11:02.283
MARISHA: Yeah.

1718
01:11:02.283 --> 01:11:04.724
MATT: All right, you find your guys' way.
You head down the gun deck

1719
01:11:04.724 --> 01:11:06.840
where there's the cargo hold below,

1720
01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:08.330
which is where a lot of the bedrooms are as well.

1721
01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:09.210
There's bedrooms on both ends.

1722
01:11:09.210 --> 01:11:10.810
TRAVIS: Looks like everything's in order.

1723
01:11:10.810 --> 01:11:12.130
What did you want to inspect?

1724
01:11:12.130 --> 01:11:13.726
LIAM: Shut the door, please.

1725
01:11:13.726 --> 01:11:14.559
TRAVIS: Shut the door.

1726
01:11:14.559 --> 01:11:16.267
LAURA: Should we check and make sure nobody--

1727
01:11:16.267 --> 01:11:18.320
MARISHA: I want to make sure no one's
following us along the--

1728
01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:20.530
LAURA: Hey, Fjord maybe you can do your thing

1729
01:11:20.530 --> 01:11:23.142
where you can see if there's little orbs following us.

1730
01:11:23.142 --> 01:11:24.183
TRAVIS: Oh, yes, good point.

1731
01:11:24.183 --> 01:11:26.680
I'll summon the Star Razor,

1732
01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:29.228
and I will cast See Invisibility.

1733
01:11:29.228 --> 01:11:30.370
MATT: You got it, all right.

1734
01:11:31.370 --> 01:11:33.080
TRAVIS: Do I see anything?

1735
01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:34.740
MATT: Glancing around the interior of the chamber right now,

1736
01:11:34.740 --> 01:11:37.315
you do not see any sort of a

1737
01:11:37.315 --> 01:11:39.950
scrying bauble or glowing orb

1738
01:11:39.950 --> 01:11:42.130
that would lead you to believe you're being scryed upon.

1739
01:11:42.130 --> 01:11:44.209
TRAVIS: God, there are orbs everywhere.

1740
01:11:44.209 --> 01:11:47.360
[Laughter]
LAURA: (gasps)

1741
01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:48.385
TRAVIS: We're in terrible danger.

1742
01:11:48.385 --> 01:11:50.710
No, I'm shitting you, we're fine.

1743
01:11:50.710 --> 01:11:54.225
LIAM: Caleb starts putting it necklace back under his shirt.

1744
01:11:55.982 --> 01:11:58.502
LAURA: What'd you hear? What'd you see?

1745
01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:02.341
LIAM: Dezran Thain, he is actually

1746
01:12:02.341 --> 01:12:05.799
our good friend, Essek Thelyss.

1747
01:12:08.410 --> 01:12:10.801
TRAVIS: What do you mean is?

1748
01:12:10.801 --> 01:12:12.718
TALIESIN: He's working for--

1749
01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:15.860
LIAM: It is a disguise.

1750
01:12:15.860 --> 01:12:17.893
LAURA: But he was walking.

1751
01:12:17.893 --> 01:12:20.893
[laughter]

1752
01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:24.520
TALIESIN: It's kind of a brilliant disguise,
if you think about it.

1753
01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:27.520
[laughter]

1754
01:12:28.790 --> 01:12:31.340
Always looking at the guy's feet. I've never really...

1755
01:12:33.710 --> 01:12:34.960
TRAVIS: Are you sure?

1756
01:12:36.257 --> 01:12:39.241
LIAM: I elaborate and recount everything.

1757
01:12:39.241 --> 01:12:41.889
LAURA: Holy shit!

1758
01:12:41.889 --> 01:12:44.299
[Laughter]
Oof!

1759
01:12:44.299 --> 01:12:48.010
MARISHA: I mean, it oddly makes a lot of sense.
LAURA: Does he-- oh!

1760
01:12:48.010 --> 01:12:51.047
MARISHA: When you look back at everything.

1761
01:12:51.047 --> 01:12:53.547
LAURA: And he said we were friends.

1762
01:12:54.435 --> 01:12:57.623
[awwing]

1763
01:12:57.623 --> 01:13:00.831
LIAM: Hard to read.
LAURA: Oh!

1764
01:13:00.831 --> 01:13:01.922
LIAM: Hard to read.

1765
01:13:01.922 --> 01:13:03.278
SAM: But to what end?

1766
01:13:03.278 --> 01:13:06.280
What is he trying to gain out of this?

1767
01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:08.990
LIAM: Research was mentioned.

1768
01:13:08.990 --> 01:13:11.490
I don't entirely understand the context.

1769
01:13:12.380 --> 01:13:14.740
TRAVIS: You mentioned an exchange.

1770
01:13:14.740 --> 01:13:18.020
It sounded like the beacon for, did you say prisoners?

1771
01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:18.853
LIAM: Yeah.

1772
01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:21.371
SAM: Well, we know there's a prisoner exchange.

1773
01:13:21.371 --> 01:13:22.204
LAURA: Yeah.

1774
01:13:22.204 --> 01:13:23.037
SAM: That was part of the deal always.

1775
01:13:23.037 --> 01:13:23.870
TRAVIS: Sure.

1776
01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:28.910
SAM: But it seems like the beacon is--

1777
01:13:28.910 --> 01:13:32.360
is either not what it appears to be,

1778
01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:36.643
or it's going to into Essek's hand instead of

1779
01:13:36.643 --> 01:13:38.495
the hands of the queen.

1780
01:13:38.495 --> 01:13:42.310
LAURA: No, but Essek is probably the one that delivered it.

1781
01:13:42.310 --> 01:13:45.800
He's the guy that leaked the beacons in the first place.

1782
01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:47.380
LIAM: All bells are ringing.

1783
01:13:47.380 --> 01:13:51.010
Every fear we have seems to be coming true.

1784
01:13:51.010 --> 01:13:52.660
This is some sort of ploy.

1785
01:13:52.660 --> 01:13:53.960
LAURA: Well, we just need to ask him.

1786
01:13:55.210 --> 01:13:56.840
SAM: Uh.

1787
01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:58.290
LAURA: I mean, why not?

1788
01:13:58.290 --> 01:13:59.830
You know, he really like us.

1789
01:13:59.830 --> 01:14:03.340
He could probably tell us the truth once we know.

1790
01:14:03.340 --> 01:14:05.633
TALIESIN: This is going to be a very weird party.

1791
01:14:05.633 --> 01:14:09.077
[laughter]

1792
01:14:09.077 --> 01:14:13.985
[laughter]

1793
01:14:13.985 --> 01:14:17.950
[laughter]

1794
01:14:17.950 --> 01:14:22.040
TRAVIS: Caleb, how do you feel?

1795
01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:23.470
LIAM: I feel like a fool.

1796
01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:28.650
TRAVIS: Why, because he didn't loop us in?

1797
01:14:28.650 --> 01:14:31.370
LIAM: No, I worried about him for ages, thinking

1798
01:14:31.370 --> 01:14:33.870
that he was perhaps the mole we were worried about

1799
01:14:33.870 --> 01:14:38.053
and when I finally

1800
01:14:38.053 --> 01:14:41.744
did away with that fear,

1801
01:14:41.744 --> 01:14:44.025
I had it confirmed.

1802
01:14:46.380 --> 01:14:48.130
He seemed somewhat conflicted,

1803
01:14:48.130 --> 01:14:52.400
but not enough to slow his pursuit.

1804
01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:54.300
Maybe sense could be talked to him,

1805
01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:57.300
but I worry that if we confront him,

1806
01:14:58.607 --> 01:14:59.773
or stop, whatever they're doing--

1807
01:14:59.773 --> 01:15:01.650
LAURA: (gasping) Oh my god, you know what we could do?

1808
01:15:01.650 --> 01:15:03.350
I have the perfect plan.

1809
01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:08.460
Let's go to the party and while we're there

1810
01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:10.260
and he's, like, kind of around,

1811
01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:12.785
we can talk about Essek.

1812
01:15:13.627 --> 01:15:15.208
[laughter]

1813
01:15:15.208 --> 01:15:18.274
And we'll just, you know,

1814
01:15:21.575 --> 01:15:23.170
we'll just be, like, talking about, "Oh my gosh,

1815
01:15:23.170 --> 01:15:25.190
"you know who I wish was here, is Essek.

1816
01:15:25.190 --> 01:15:26.965
"I love him so much I'm so glad

1817
01:15:26.965 --> 01:15:28.223
"that we're such good friends with him now.

1818
01:15:28.223 --> 01:15:31.806
"I never knew that anyone could be so wonderful."

1819
01:15:31.806 --> 01:15:32.795
You know?

1820
01:15:32.795 --> 01:15:34.920
SAM: And then after a few moments,

1821
01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:36.617
he'll say, "It's me, I'm Essek!"

1822
01:15:36.617 --> 01:15:37.600
LAURA: Yeah, yeah!

1823
01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:38.950
SAM: "I can't take it anymore,

1824
01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:40.583
"the guilt is too much."
LAURA: Either one, he'll feel really guilty,

1825
01:15:40.583 --> 01:15:43.170
or number two, he'll want to take credit

1826
01:15:43.170 --> 01:15:45.835
for it all, because he's so wonderful.

1827
01:15:47.700 --> 01:15:49.208
MARISHA: Yeah.
LIAM: Maybe.

1828
01:15:49.208 --> 01:15:51.730
LAURA: I think it's a really good idea.

1829
01:15:51.730 --> 01:15:53.670
SAM: Well, we definitely need to go to this party

1830
01:15:53.670 --> 01:15:55.000
and see what else we can find.

1831
01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:55.833
LAURA: Yeah.

1832
01:15:55.833 --> 01:16:00.833
SAM: Tail him or investigate him
or knock him out or something.

1833
01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:03.330
Do we have any poison, can we poison him?

1834
01:16:03.330 --> 01:16:06.380
LIAM: Well, if we remove him from the equation.

1835
01:16:07.650 --> 01:16:08.670
MARISHA: None of this happens.

1836
01:16:08.670 --> 01:16:09.880
LIAM: None of this happens.

1837
01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:13.010
MARISHA: He's integral to this entire thing.

1838
01:16:13.010 --> 01:16:14.476
LAURA: But he said he wasn't even coming,

1839
01:16:14.476 --> 01:16:16.580
I mean, he was another guy, but...

1840
01:16:16.580 --> 01:16:19.780
SAM: Fjord could disguise himself as Dezran Thain.

1841
01:16:19.780 --> 01:16:22.054
TRAVIS: Whoa, uh...
LAURA: Yeah!

1842
01:16:22.054 --> 01:16:24.284
[laughter]

1843
01:16:24.284 --> 01:16:27.573
SAM: And then <i>we'd</i> have a mole on the ship.

1844
01:16:27.573 --> 01:16:29.960
LAURA: Yeah, oh my god, that's really good.

1845
01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:31.426
SAM: We take out Essek,

1846
01:16:31.426 --> 01:16:33.097
and we replace him with one of us.

1847
01:16:33.097 --> 01:16:37.170
LAURA: Yeah, and Martinet already
knows that there's an illusion,

1848
01:16:37.170 --> 01:16:40.170
so he would be like, "Oh, I see that's it an illusion."

1849
01:16:40.170 --> 01:16:42.653
But he would not realize
it's another person in the illusion.

1850
01:16:42.653 --> 01:16:44.830
TALIESIN: Except that the other person
would be in the same room.

1851
01:16:44.830 --> 01:16:47.470
I mean, then he would definitely know it was an illusion.

1852
01:16:47.470 --> 01:16:49.880
If I'm doing my math right, there's--

1853
01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:50.955
SAM: No, we take out the Essek.

1854
01:16:50.955 --> 01:16:53.562
We're going to knock him out with some sort of poison.

1855
01:16:53.562 --> 01:16:56.288
TALIESIN: And Essek isn't at the meeting, then?

1856
01:16:56.288 --> 01:16:58.080
LAURA: What?
SAM: Fjord is.

1857
01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:01.120
MARISHA: Well, Fjord would be Essek as Deylas Thain.

1858
01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:02.210
TALIESIN: Wow.

1859
01:17:02.210 --> 01:17:03.760
[laughter]

1860
01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:05.593
ASHLEY: This is complicated.

1861
01:17:06.550 --> 01:17:11.391
MARISHA: As not bad of a plan as that is--

1862
01:17:11.391 --> 01:17:13.450
wait, wait, wait.
TRAVIS: What?!

1863
01:17:13.450 --> 01:17:16.460
MARISHA: We do not have near enough information

1864
01:17:16.460 --> 01:17:19.230
for any of that to be pulled off smoothly.

1865
01:17:19.230 --> 01:17:20.063
LIAM: That is true.
LAURA: Good point.

1866
01:17:20.063 --> 01:17:20.896
TALIESIN: That is true.

1867
01:17:20.896 --> 01:17:24.390
LIAM: And we are also dealing with the most intelligent,

1868
01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:26.710
ruthless and cunning practitioners

1869
01:17:26.710 --> 01:17:29.893
of the arcane in all of the Empire.

1870
01:17:29.893 --> 01:17:30.726
LAURA: Ugh.

1871
01:17:31.848 --> 01:17:34.040
[laughter]

1872
01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:36.050
SAM: I don't think he's talking about us.

1873
01:17:36.050 --> 01:17:38.170
LAURA: No, I know. I forgot to ask Martinet

1874
01:17:38.170 --> 01:17:39.839
If he wanted a tattoo.

1875
01:17:39.839 --> 01:17:44.772
[laughter]

1876
01:17:50.757 --> 01:17:52.199
SAM: That--

1877
01:17:52.199 --> 01:17:55.260
That is unfortunate.

1878
01:17:55.260 --> 01:17:58.510
LIAM: That sounds like party chitchat to me.

1879
01:17:58.510 --> 01:18:01.480
TRAVIS: Okay so, tomorrow night, before we

1880
01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:04.857
weigh doing any of this crazy bullshit,

1881
01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:08.000
we have a night to prepare.

1882
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.780
Nott, do you still want to go forward with your--

1883
01:18:10.780 --> 01:18:13.510
SAM: I mean, I'm a little distracted

1884
01:18:13.510 --> 01:18:15.990
now that we've been betrayed.

1885
01:18:15.990 --> 01:18:19.430
Also ,Essek is the one who gave us this,

1886
01:18:20.540 --> 01:18:23.500
who helped unlock the secret of this spell?

1887
01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:24.370
LAURA: I mean, we can--

1888
01:18:24.370 --> 01:18:26.420
SAM: Is it a bad thing?

1889
01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:27.730
LAURA: (gasping) I got a really good idea.

1890
01:18:27.730 --> 01:18:29.705
TRAVIS: Oh no.

1891
01:18:29.705 --> 01:18:31.246
Does it involves tattoos?

1892
01:18:31.246 --> 01:18:35.840
LAURA: No. Oh my god. (excited noise)

1893
01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:39.100
While we're around Dezran Thain

1894
01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:42.423
I'm going to send a message to Essek.

1895
01:18:42.423 --> 01:18:45.733
[laughter]

1896
01:18:45.733 --> 01:18:49.458
[cheering]

1897
01:18:56.350 --> 01:18:59.595
MARISHA: That's so Cheaters of you.

1898
01:19:01.950 --> 01:19:02.783
TRAVIS: That's pretty good.

1899
01:19:02.783 --> 01:19:03.616
SAM: That's amazing.
MARISHA: It's not bad.

1900
01:19:03.616 --> 01:19:04.449
ASHLEY: It's actually

1901
01:19:04.449 --> 01:19:06.420
a very good idea.
TRAVIS: It's pretty good.

1902
01:19:06.420 --> 01:19:07.660
MARISHA: Hey, Jester.

1903
01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:08.493
LAURA: Yes.

1904
01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:11.826
MARISHA: Your tattoos.

1905
01:19:11.826 --> 01:19:13.540
LAURA: Yeah.

1906
01:19:13.540 --> 01:19:15.100
MARISHA: How much did Orly teach you

1907
01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:18.216
about making, like, enchanted tattoos?

1908
01:19:18.216 --> 01:19:20.380
LAURA: Oh, well.

1909
01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:23.755
He started to--

1910
01:19:23.755 --> 01:19:24.588
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

1911
01:19:25.485 --> 01:19:30.010
LAURA: -- and then I think I remember noticing

1912
01:19:30.010 --> 01:19:32.626
how many wrinkles were on his neck

1913
01:19:32.626 --> 01:19:35.170
[laughter]

1914
01:19:35.170 --> 01:19:38.680
and I couldn't tell, like, where it goes when his head

1915
01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:40.600
goes in there, does it come,

1916
01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:42.340
I don't know I just got,

1917
01:19:42.340 --> 01:19:45.910
I remember not hearing what he was saying.

1918
01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:49.205
LIAM: What did he say, Nott?

1919
01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:54.300
[laughter]

1920
01:19:55.709 --> 01:19:57.215
TALIESIN: Ah! Ha!

1921
01:19:57.215 --> 01:19:58.348
LAURA and TALIESIN: That was good.

1922
01:19:58.348 --> 01:20:00.048
SAM: Good one.

1923
01:20:00.048 --> 01:20:02.148
(laughter)

1924
01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:04.190
TRAVIS: Wait, I'm confused.

1925
01:20:04.190 --> 01:20:06.400
So we're betrayed because Essek

1926
01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:09.650
is going to take the beacon back to the Dynasty.

1927
01:20:09.650 --> 01:20:11.075
TALIESIN: We don't know enough.

1928
01:20:11.075 --> 01:20:12.962
TRAVIS: And then the Empire is going to get their prisoners.

1929
01:20:12.962 --> 01:20:14.817
LAURA: No he-- oh.
TRAVIS: Right?

1930
01:20:14.817 --> 01:20:17.660
MARISHA: He said he wanted the research.

1931
01:20:17.660 --> 01:20:18.830
TRAVIS: And the beacon.

1932
01:20:18.830 --> 01:20:23.030
MARISHA: Remember when he came over and we pressured him

1933
01:20:23.030 --> 01:20:24.946
into getting into the hot tub?

1934
01:20:24.946 --> 01:20:25.779
LAURA: Yeah.

1935
01:20:25.779 --> 01:20:28.122
MARISHA: And we like, bonded.

1936
01:20:28.122 --> 01:20:29.346
LAURA: Yeah.

1937
01:20:29.346 --> 01:20:32.730
MARISHA: He was talking about his pursuits

1938
01:20:32.730 --> 01:20:34.800
and about he how badly he wants

1939
01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:39.050
to see how far he can take dunamancy.

1940
01:20:39.050 --> 01:20:40.620
LAURA: Yeah.

1941
01:20:40.620 --> 01:20:45.420
MARISHA: And how far he could
reach beyond what is sanctioned

1942
01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:48.280
or structured within the Empire

1943
01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:49.763
or within the Dynasty, I mean.
LIAM: Yeah, and we know the Empire

1944
01:20:49.763 --> 01:20:52.550
has been monkeying around with it, yeah?

1945
01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:53.560
MARISHA: Yeah.

1946
01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:58.280
LIAM: So perhaps Essek is trying to
learn more about their own

1947
01:20:58.280 --> 01:20:59.938
artifact from the Empire,

1948
01:20:59.938 --> 01:21:01.940
what the Empire has twisted it into.

1949
01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:04.970
TALIESIN: Maybe, oh man, maybe.

1950
01:21:04.970 --> 01:21:09.970
I mean, in theory there's a second beacon.

1951
01:21:09.970 --> 01:21:13.930
Maybe he knows and do we know for sure

1952
01:21:13.930 --> 01:21:16.810
if those prisoners were executed

1953
01:21:16.810 --> 01:21:20.640
back when we were--

1954
01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:21.670
LAURA: Like, his friends?

1955
01:21:21.670 --> 01:21:25.400
TALIESIN: Yeah, I mean, we don't really know, do we?

1956
01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:28.070
There could be second deal.

1957
01:21:28.070 --> 01:21:30.510
MARISHA: Well, if they're exchanging the prisoners,

1958
01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:36.280
the prisoners are high-ranking members

1959
01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:39.320
of the Assembly and the Empire.

1960
01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:41.200
TALIESIN: Maybe this is just another deal.

1961
01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:42.790
MARISHA: It is another deal.

1962
01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:44.030
That's exactly what it is.

1963
01:21:44.030 --> 01:21:46.880
But if you put it under the guise of a prisoner exchange,

1964
01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:50.470
it becomes acceptable.

1965
01:21:50.470 --> 01:21:53.228
TRAVIS: Right, but we trust Essek.

1966
01:21:53.228 --> 01:21:55.690
We have to at least give him the opportunity to fail, right?

1967
01:21:55.690 --> 01:21:58.150
I mean, he might be altruistic.

1968
01:21:58.150 --> 01:21:59.490
He might be doing this for good reasons.

1969
01:21:59.490 --> 01:22:02.473
TALIESIN: Or at least given the
opportunity to explain himself

1970
01:22:02.473 --> 01:22:05.752
and then maybe give us the opportunity to--

1971
01:22:05.752 --> 01:22:07.257
ASHLEY: Kill him.

1972
01:22:07.257 --> 01:22:09.210
[Laughter]
What?

1973
01:22:09.210 --> 01:22:14.210
TALIESIN: Or cover and try and
help make sure that everything

1974
01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:15.879
goes well for everybody.
ASHLEY: That's what I meant,

1975
01:22:15.879 --> 01:22:18.854
I just said it in a different way.
TALIESIN: I mean, I respect the initiative.

1976
01:22:18.854 --> 01:22:21.162
SAM: I see it as a choice between:

1977
01:22:21.162 --> 01:22:24.802
Are we going to confront Essek before this journey,

1978
01:22:24.802 --> 01:22:27.093
or just tag along in the journey and hope to learn more.

1979
01:22:27.093 --> 01:22:28.226
LAURA: But he said he wasn't coming.

1980
01:22:28.226 --> 01:22:30.400
I mean, he said Lord Thain

1981
01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:31.900
wasn't coming on the journey.

1982
01:22:31.900 --> 01:22:32.840
SAM: He's clearly coming.

1983
01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:33.673
MARISHA: He's coming.

1984
01:22:33.673 --> 01:22:35.788
He wouldn't be here if he wasn't coming.
TALIESIN: He'll be in the other boat, I imagine.

1985
01:22:35.788 --> 01:22:37.700
LIAM: He could maybe be disguised as someone else.

1986
01:22:37.700 --> 01:22:38.533
MARISHA: Absolutely.

1987
01:22:38.533 --> 01:22:41.440
LIAM: All we know is that there is a lot we do not know.

1988
01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:43.410
TRAVIS: And we can't endanger him at this party

1989
01:22:43.410 --> 01:22:45.760
and that's not the opportunity of to confront him.

1990
01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:47.920
It should be some other time.

1991
01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:51.273
We don't want to put him in danger if his intentions are...

1992
01:22:51.273 --> 01:22:52.647
good.

1993
01:22:52.647 --> 01:22:54.910
LAURA: He did say we were friends.

1994
01:22:54.910 --> 01:22:59.910
MARISHA: If his intentions are good,
then why is he hiding it?

1995
01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:05.086
LIAM: It's possible he is playing

1996
01:23:05.086 --> 01:23:07.911
your home country.

1997
01:23:07.911 --> 01:23:09.143
LAURA: It's also possible, you know,

1998
01:23:09.143 --> 01:23:11.290
that he thinks we're kind of fuck-ups

1999
01:23:11.290 --> 01:23:14.270
and we might ruin his plan if we knew about it.

2000
01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:16.270
LIAM: I just worry if we confront him

2001
01:23:16.270 --> 01:23:17.850
or take him out of the picture,

2002
01:23:17.850 --> 01:23:20.933
all of this deal will fall on its face.

2003
01:23:20.933 --> 01:23:23.154
MARISHA: No, we have to let him go.

2004
01:23:23.154 --> 01:23:25.670
TALIESIN: Intentions and actions are rarely connected.

2005
01:23:25.670 --> 01:23:29.107
They're distant cousins.

2006
01:23:29.107 --> 01:23:29.940
I mean, it's true.

2007
01:23:29.940 --> 01:23:31.640
Think about everybody here.

2008
01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:34.615
This is a whole group of people with,

2009
01:23:34.615 --> 01:23:37.334
I mean, I'll just say it, we have some issues.

2010
01:23:37.334 --> 01:23:40.334
[laughter]

2011
01:23:42.474 --> 01:23:45.624
[laughter]

2012
01:23:47.700 --> 01:23:50.060
SAM: All right, we're going to this party.

2013
01:23:50.060 --> 01:23:51.830
We can learn more there possibly.

2014
01:23:51.830 --> 01:23:52.663
LAURA: Yeah.

2015
01:23:52.663 --> 01:23:55.429
SAM: In the meantime, let's go see your mom.

2016
01:23:55.429 --> 01:23:57.010
LAURA: Yeah.

2017
01:23:57.010 --> 01:23:57.843
MARISHA: Okay.

2018
01:23:57.843 --> 01:24:00.040
TALIESIN: I offer gems, I offer clay.

2019
01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:00.873
SAM: You what?

2020
01:24:00.873 --> 01:24:02.523
TALIESIN: I offer gems, I offered clay.

2021
01:24:02.523 --> 01:24:03.472
Everyone keep their eyes open.

2022
01:24:03.472 --> 01:24:04.474
SAM: Okay, all right, all right.

2023
01:24:04.474 --> 01:24:05.882
TALIESIN: We should do this.
LAURA: (gasps) Oh my gosh.

2024
01:24:05.882 --> 01:24:06.973
TALIESIN: This is important.

2025
01:24:06.973 --> 01:24:09.222
LAURA: I'm a sapphire, you're Caduceus Clay.

2026
01:24:09.222 --> 01:24:10.776
We already found them.

2027
01:24:10.776 --> 01:24:13.776
[laughter]

2028
01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:21.640
SAM: So I just have to grind you guys up
and lie down in you?

2029
01:24:22.048 --> 01:24:23.948
TALIESIN: That'll work.

2030
01:24:23.948 --> 01:24:25.580
SAM: Cool.

2031
01:24:25.580 --> 01:24:28.205
MATT: That's wonderfully poetic and not intentional at all.

2032
01:24:28.205 --> 01:24:29.205
I love that.

2033
01:24:31.690 --> 01:24:34.030
So you guys head back into the Opal Archways.

2034
01:24:34.030 --> 01:24:35.760
You pass through the market on the way.

2035
01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:38.270
It's easy enough for you to gather numerous gems,

2036
01:24:38.270 --> 01:24:40.500
or you can get a singular gem for the cost of 150

2037
01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:42.070
or a little higher than that.

2038
01:24:42.070 --> 01:24:44.770
And with your jeweler's kit, you can crush it down.

2039
01:24:44.770 --> 01:24:45.670
LAURA: Okay.

2040
01:24:45.670 --> 01:24:47.428
LIAM: So we need to purchase?

2041
01:24:47.428 --> 01:24:49.410
MATT: You do.
LIAM: We don't have it?

2042
01:24:49.410 --> 01:24:50.243
MATT: Unless you have a gem that you want to

2043
01:24:50.243 --> 01:24:51.909
try and crush down that's worth 150.

2044
01:24:51.909 --> 01:24:53.335
LAURA: No, I want to keep the gems that we have.

2045
01:24:53.335 --> 01:24:56.505
LIAM: I would prefer to buy these gems.

2046
01:24:56.505 --> 01:24:57.338
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2047
01:24:57.338 --> 01:24:59.490
We'll make them really colorful.

2048
01:24:59.490 --> 01:25:00.323
SAM: Sure, yeah.

2049
01:25:00.323 --> 01:25:01.156
LAURA and MATT: Okay.

2050
01:25:01.156 --> 01:25:02.890
LAURA: Just a bunch of little ones, all different colors.

2051
01:25:02.890 --> 01:25:06.430
So it's like fun glitter on Beau right now.

2052
01:25:06.430 --> 01:25:08.010
MATT: Okay.

2053
01:25:08.010 --> 01:25:12.650
There are a number of individuals who who work in pottery

2054
01:25:12.650 --> 01:25:16.130
and various clay-based decor,

2055
01:25:16.130 --> 01:25:18.680
so you can acquire, relatively cheaply,

2056
01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:20.862
about the 50 pounds of clay that you require.

2057
01:25:20.862 --> 01:25:23.836
Just the equal amount of physical body weight

2058
01:25:23.836 --> 01:25:26.560
to roughly what Nott is in goblin.

2059
01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:28.390
TALIESIN: Yeah, how much will that run?

2060
01:25:28.390 --> 01:25:29.320
MATT: For 50 pounds of clay,

2061
01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:32.260
I'd put it at, like, maybe gold and a half.

2062
01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:33.230
TALIESIN: Wow.

2063
01:25:33.230 --> 01:25:35.640
ASHLEY: I can carry it.

2064
01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:37.270
TRAVIS: So can I, no big deal.

2065
01:25:37.270 --> 01:25:39.960
MARISHA: Yeah, me too. Fuck.

2066
01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:42.368
Now it's only, like, 15 pounds each, that's not cool.

2067
01:25:42.368 --> 01:25:44.493
You can have it.
TRAVIS: No, I don't-- oh.

2068
01:25:47.038 --> 01:25:49.541
ASHLEY: Fjord, I can carry it for you if it's too heavy.

2069
01:25:49.541 --> 01:25:51.320
TRAVIS: Not a problem.

2070
01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:53.533
ASHLEY: You look like you've gotten shorter

2071
01:25:53.533 --> 01:25:55.366
because of the weight.

2072
01:25:56.430 --> 01:25:59.308
TRAVIS: No, it's my casual way of walking.

2073
01:26:00.730 --> 01:26:02.238
This means I don't care.

2074
01:26:02.238 --> 01:26:05.110
[laughter]

2075
01:26:05.110 --> 01:26:06.163
MARISHA: That's pretty good, actually.

2076
01:26:06.163 --> 01:26:08.108
ASHLEY: It's working.

2077
01:26:08.108 --> 01:26:09.707
TALIESIN: Is it?
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2078
01:26:09.707 --> 01:26:10.998
TRAVIS: I feel like I have to fart.

2079
01:26:10.998 --> 01:26:11.831
(laughter)

2080
01:26:12.739 --> 01:26:15.090
MARISHA: On that, I run up to Jester.

2081
01:26:15.090 --> 01:26:18.010
Hey, that tattoo thing.

2082
01:26:18.010 --> 01:26:18.843
LAURA: Oh yeah.

2083
01:26:18.843 --> 01:26:21.720
MARISHA: Okay, I have a weird question.

2084
01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:24.450
LAURA: Okay, I like weird questions!

2085
01:26:24.450 --> 01:26:26.260
MARISHA: Sometimes when you go to these, like,

2086
01:26:26.260 --> 01:26:29.081
fancy upper echelon parties--
LAURA: Yeah?

2087
01:26:29.081 --> 01:26:32.081
MARISHA: -- there's a tattoo artist there

2088
01:26:32.081 --> 01:26:36.880
giving out free tattoos and after, like, a few drinks,

2089
01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:39.520
people are like, "I think I <i>do</i> want a tattoo."

2090
01:26:41.170 --> 01:26:45.940
If you tattoo someone, can you then scry on that tattoo?

2091
01:26:47.240 --> 01:26:51.430
Is that like, since it's using ink and stuff?

2092
01:26:51.430 --> 01:26:54.880
LAURA: I mean, I would have intimate knowledge

2093
01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:56.020
of something on their body,

2094
01:26:56.020 --> 01:26:58.820
so yeah, I probably could scry pretty easy.

2095
01:26:59.670 --> 01:27:01.520
LIAM: What if we just pick up some henna?

2096
01:27:02.730 --> 01:27:05.150
LAURA: I think it works better if it's, like, permanent.

2097
01:27:05.150 --> 01:27:05.983
ASHLEY: Wait, what do you mean

2098
01:27:05.983 --> 01:27:09.466
you'll have intimate knowledge of their body?

2099
01:27:09.466 --> 01:27:12.700
Did I, sorry, am I misunderstanding what you said?

2100
01:27:12.700 --> 01:27:14.433
LAURA: I'm not saying I sleep with people

2101
01:27:14.433 --> 01:27:17.400
when I tattoo them, I'm saying--

2102
01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:19.660
ASHLEY: But, like, you tattoo them
and then you see everything.

2103
01:27:19.660 --> 01:27:22.800
LAURA: No, I just would know--
Like, if I tattooed your bicep, Yasha.

2104
01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:23.633
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2105
01:27:23.633 --> 01:27:25.389
LAURA: I would have intimate knowledge of your bicep.

2106
01:27:25.389 --> 01:27:26.814
ASHLEY: (impressed and excited laugh)

2107
01:27:26.814 --> 01:27:29.681
(laughter)

2108
01:27:29.681 --> 01:27:34.581
(laughter)

2109
01:27:37.743 --> 01:27:40.684
That's a cool trick.

2110
01:27:40.684 --> 01:27:44.560
[laughter]

2111
01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:47.409
I'm going to keep carrying this clay.

2112
01:27:47.409 --> 01:27:49.825
[laughter]

2113
01:27:49.825 --> 01:27:51.016
MATT: All right, are you you guys making your way

2114
01:27:51.016 --> 01:27:52.440
to the Lavish Chateau, then?

2115
01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:53.273
LAURA: Yes.

2116
01:27:53.273 --> 01:27:56.514
MATT: Okay, you make your way through the entrance

2117
01:27:56.514 --> 01:27:58.800
to the archways, the streets are beautiful.

2118
01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:02.140
The multicolored stone work that lays across the roads

2119
01:28:02.140 --> 01:28:05.180
in front of you are matched by the large multicolored

2120
01:28:05.180 --> 01:28:08.090
banners that stretch across the different

2121
01:28:08.090 --> 01:28:11.181
squares and the large tall buildings where all the

2122
01:28:11.181 --> 01:28:13.790
nobles either own establishments to stay in

2123
01:28:13.790 --> 01:28:15.180
or there are rentable establishments,

2124
01:28:15.180 --> 01:28:16.840
those who are traveling through Nicodranas,

2125
01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:18.681
since that is a hub of travel

2126
01:28:18.681 --> 01:28:21.300
along the coast and to the Empire.

2127
01:28:21.300 --> 01:28:23.250
It's beautiful in the daylight as it is in the night,

2128
01:28:23.250 --> 01:28:26.450
though a different type of more colorful aesthetic.

2129
01:28:26.450 --> 01:28:27.980
And there you see the Lavish Chateau,

2130
01:28:27.980 --> 01:28:32.130
the welcoming architecture of the multi-tiered,

2131
01:28:32.130 --> 01:28:36.830
beautiful home to Marion, the mother of Jester.

2132
01:28:36.830 --> 01:28:38.038
As you enter the interior of it,

2133
01:28:38.038 --> 01:28:39.496
it's early enough in the day,

2134
01:28:39.496 --> 01:28:42.417
you're pushing the afternoonish now, I'd say,

2135
01:28:42.417 --> 01:28:43.633
it's early enough in the day where there isn't

2136
01:28:43.633 --> 01:28:45.810
a lot of patronage yet.

2137
01:28:45.810 --> 01:28:49.500
You see Carlos Remedi, who is the keeper of the bar

2138
01:28:49.500 --> 01:28:51.180
down below, looks over towards you

2139
01:28:51.180 --> 01:28:54.070
with his thicker mustache and his combed over hair.

2140
01:28:54.070 --> 01:28:56.100
He's like, "Hi, welcome,

2141
01:28:56.100 --> 01:28:56.933
"it's good to see you, Jester.

2142
01:28:56.933 --> 01:28:58.040
"It's been a while.

2143
01:28:58.040 --> 01:28:59.831
"And your friends as well."

2144
01:28:59.831 --> 01:29:00.808
SAM: ♪ It's been... ♪

2145
01:29:00.808 --> 01:29:01.641
LAURA: No.

2146
01:29:01.641 --> 01:29:04.725
[laughter]

2147
01:29:04.725 --> 01:29:07.000
MATT: "Is your mother know you are coming?"

2148
01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:08.337
LAURA: My who?

2149
01:29:08.337 --> 01:29:09.900
MATT: "Your mother."

2150
01:29:09.900 --> 01:29:10.733
LAURA: No.

2151
01:29:10.733 --> 01:29:12.190
MATT: "Oh, you're surprising her?"

2152
01:29:12.190 --> 01:29:13.023
LAURA: Yeah.

2153
01:29:13.023 --> 01:29:15.581
MATT: "Very nice, very nice.

2154
01:29:15.581 --> 01:29:18.180
"Well, she's probably upstairs if you want."

2155
01:29:18.180 --> 01:29:20.221
At which, point you hear (quick footsteps)

2156
01:29:20.221 --> 01:29:22.270
and you see running down the stairs,

2157
01:29:22.270 --> 01:29:26.160
lighter footfalls and coming down

2158
01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:28.760
you see, looks to be halfling feet.

2159
01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:31.237
SAM: (panicked noises) I go invisible.

2160
01:29:31.237 --> 01:29:32.070
[laughter]

2161
01:29:32.070 --> 01:29:36.710
Okay, and down the stairs, you see, holding a wooden sword,

2162
01:29:36.710 --> 01:29:39.518
you see Luc

2163
01:29:39.518 --> 01:29:42.454
[awwing]

2164
01:29:42.454 --> 01:29:43.812
running down and kind of like,

2165
01:29:43.812 --> 01:29:48.060
"(exertions) Oh, hi."

2166
01:29:48.060 --> 01:29:48.893
LIAM: Hello, little fellow.

2167
01:29:48.893 --> 01:29:50.134
LAURA: Hi Luc.
ASHLEY: Hello.

2168
01:29:50.134 --> 01:29:51.960
LIAM: Long time no see.

2169
01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:54.670
MATT: "Yeah. Where's Mom? Is Mom with you guys?"

2170
01:29:54.670 --> 01:29:56.610
LAURA: She is on her way.

2171
01:29:56.610 --> 01:29:57.857
LIAM: She'll be here very soon.

2172
01:29:57.857 --> 01:29:59.023
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: "Oh, cool."

2173
01:29:59.023 --> 01:30:02.740
LAURA: She wanted to get super pretty to see you.

2174
01:30:02.740 --> 01:30:03.573
MATT: "Okay."

2175
01:30:03.573 --> 01:30:05.020
LAURA: Yeah.

2176
01:30:05.020 --> 01:30:06.103
MATT: And he hits the banister and dents it

2177
01:30:06.103 --> 01:30:07.740
and you can see Carlos is like,

2178
01:30:07.740 --> 01:30:10.140
"Hey, hey, what you doing?

2179
01:30:10.140 --> 01:30:11.950
"I polished that.

2180
01:30:11.950 --> 01:30:14.367
"This kid is driving me crazy."

2181
01:30:15.260 --> 01:30:17.200
LAURA: Luc, Luc, Luc, come here.

2182
01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:18.970
I take him by the hand.

2183
01:30:18.970 --> 01:30:19.803
MATT: (as Luc) "Yeah?"

2184
01:30:19.803 --> 01:30:22.470
LAURA: I want to show you my paint stash that I left here.

2185
01:30:22.470 --> 01:30:25.344
You can make additions all over the Chateau.

2186
01:30:25.344 --> 01:30:28.344
[laughter]

2187
01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:31.400
MATT: "Okay!"

2188
01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:32.233
LAURA: I'll bring him--

2189
01:30:32.233 --> 01:30:34.766
oh, well, I guess I'll wait until we get into the room.

2190
01:30:34.766 --> 01:30:36.320
It's hiding in my room.

2191
01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:38.650
MATT: Okay, as you head upstairs, you can see Carlos

2192
01:30:38.650 --> 01:30:41.490
looking at Luc as he goes up the stairs there.

2193
01:30:41.490 --> 01:30:43.723
He look back at him and goes--

2194
01:30:43.723 --> 01:30:46.168
And he looks up at him and--

2195
01:30:46.168 --> 01:30:48.937
[laughter]

2196
01:30:48.937 --> 01:30:51.160
You make your way up.

2197
01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:54.550
You see Bluud there is in the process of smoking a pipe,

2198
01:30:54.550 --> 01:30:56.083
with his immense Minotaur form,

2199
01:30:56.083 --> 01:30:56.960
lean against the door

2200
01:30:56.960 --> 01:31:00.585
and kind of, "Oh, Jester."

2201
01:31:00.585 --> 01:31:01.418
LAURA: Hi, Bluud.

2202
01:31:01.418 --> 01:31:04.900
MATT: Stands up and opens the door to your mom's chambers.

2203
01:31:04.900 --> 01:31:07.370
LAURA: Thank you, is she...?

2204
01:31:07.370 --> 01:31:09.010
MATT: "Oh, she's available."

2205
01:31:09.010 --> 01:31:09.843
LAURA: Okay.

2206
01:31:10.730 --> 01:31:13.730
MATT: As you walk inside you can see the balcony doors open,

2207
01:31:13.730 --> 01:31:14.830
the breeze is blowing through,

2208
01:31:14.830 --> 01:31:18.630
the silk curtains are slowly swaying with each gust.

2209
01:31:18.630 --> 01:31:21.510
She's set up on her bed with a book open

2210
01:31:21.510 --> 01:31:23.860
and she immediately looks up and closes it

2211
01:31:23.860 --> 01:31:25.585
and sets it aside. (thunk)

2212
01:31:26.876 --> 01:31:27.709
"Jester?"

2213
01:31:29.050 --> 01:31:29.990
LAURA: Hey, mama.

2214
01:31:29.990 --> 01:31:32.290
MATT: "Oh my sweet sapphire,"

2215
01:31:32.290 --> 01:31:33.889
and she jumps off the bed and runs up

2216
01:31:33.889 --> 01:31:35.180
and just gives you a big hug

2217
01:31:35.180 --> 01:31:37.330
and lifts you up and spins you a bit.

2218
01:31:37.330 --> 01:31:38.163
LAURA: Mama.

2219
01:31:38.163 --> 01:31:38.996
MATT: "Yes?"

2220
01:31:38.996 --> 01:31:40.854
LAURA: (whispers) I got a tattoo.

2221
01:31:40.854 --> 01:31:43.850
[laughter]

2222
01:31:47.940 --> 01:31:50.950
MATT: There's a a brief look of like, oh?

2223
01:31:50.950 --> 01:31:53.210
And then a look of like, "Well, show me!"

2224
01:31:54.220 --> 01:31:55.587
LAURA: It's really big.

2225
01:31:56.980 --> 01:32:00.638
MATT: "That is beautiful, my Sapphire. I love it."

2226
01:32:00.638 --> 01:32:01.907
LAURA: See, it sparkles.

2227
01:32:01.907 --> 01:32:03.433
MATT: "It does, oh, bring it here, bring it here."

2228
01:32:03.433 --> 01:32:05.149
And she pulls you over towards

2229
01:32:05.149 --> 01:32:06.800
where the light is coming in from the the window

2230
01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:08.558
and you see it glittering,

2231
01:32:08.558 --> 01:32:11.116
And you're like this-- "Aw.

2232
01:32:11.116 --> 01:32:15.040
"See, you are the gem you were always meant to be."

2233
01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:16.790
LAURA: My friends.

2234
01:32:16.790 --> 01:32:18.806
MATT: "It's a pleasure to see you all again."

2235
01:32:18.806 --> 01:32:19.743
ASHLEY: Hello.
LIAM: It's good to see you again.

2236
01:32:19.743 --> 01:32:21.037
MARISHA: Hi.

2237
01:32:21.037 --> 01:32:24.160
LAURA: Oh! I kneel down and I say: Luc go in my room,

2238
01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:25.490
look behind the bookshelf.

2239
01:32:25.490 --> 01:32:27.400
There's a loose plank on the wall.

2240
01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:30.816
If you open it, you'll find a treat.

2241
01:32:30.816 --> 01:32:31.949
MATT: And he runs off.

2242
01:32:31.949 --> 01:32:34.100
[laughter]

2243
01:32:34.100 --> 01:32:36.450
MARISHA: That's not a pastry you left
here, like, four years ago, is it?

2244
01:32:36.450 --> 01:32:37.850
LAURA: No, no, no, it's a box of paint.

2245
01:32:37.850 --> 01:32:38.782
It's a box of paint.

2246
01:32:38.782 --> 01:32:40.500
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

2247
01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:42.390
LAURA: Should I tell him not to eat it?

2248
01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:44.433
MARISHA: No.
SAM: No, he's not an idiot.

2249
01:32:44.433 --> 01:32:45.797
LAURA: Oh, hi, Nott.

2250
01:32:45.797 --> 01:32:46.953
TALIESIN: (startled noise)

2251
01:32:46.953 --> 01:32:48.653
SAM: I'm over here.

2252
01:32:48.653 --> 01:32:50.136
Sorry, I'm here, too.

2253
01:32:51.690 --> 01:32:55.031
Um, Ruby of the Sea, Mrs.

2254
01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:57.200
MATT: "Where is this sound coming from?"

2255
01:32:57.200 --> 01:33:00.020
SAM: Sorry. Hi, I'm over here. I pick up a pillow

2256
01:33:00.020 --> 01:33:01.187
and just wave it around.

2257
01:33:01.187 --> 01:33:02.020
MATT: "Oh!

2258
01:33:03.243 --> 01:33:04.076
"All right.

2259
01:33:04.076 --> 01:33:07.170
"The small girl. Yes, it's good to see you."

2260
01:33:07.170 --> 01:33:09.672
SAM: Do you have a bathtub?

2261
01:33:12.220 --> 01:33:15.030
MATT: "I have quite a nice bathtub, actually."

2262
01:33:15.030 --> 01:33:16.957
SAM: Could we fill it with clay?

2263
01:33:16.957 --> 01:33:21.007
[laughter]

2264
01:33:22.010 --> 01:33:23.550
MATT: Her expression darts throughout the group

2265
01:33:23.550 --> 01:33:25.050
and then back at Jester.

2266
01:33:25.050 --> 01:33:27.100
LAURA: We'll cover it with fabric before we do.

2267
01:33:28.100 --> 01:33:29.742
It won't get stained.

2268
01:33:31.300 --> 01:33:34.310
MATT: "Very well. As long as you
promise not to harm the bathtub,

2269
01:33:34.310 --> 01:33:38.214
"then, you know, I'm not one to kink shame."

2270
01:33:38.214 --> 01:33:43.047
[laughter, cheers]

2271
01:33:48.897 --> 01:33:50.450
MATT: "Just make sure you clean up when you're done."

2272
01:33:50.450 --> 01:33:53.128
LAURA: Yes, it's not like that, but thank you.

2273
01:33:54.380 --> 01:33:55.663
MATT: "No judgment."

2274
01:33:57.470 --> 01:33:58.720
SAM: Thank you.

2275
01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:00.470
The pillow just sort of nods.

2276
01:34:00.470 --> 01:34:02.920
MATT: "That is a bit expensive, however,"

2277
01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:05.980
and she takes the pillow.

2278
01:34:05.980 --> 01:34:07.220
TRAVIS: You'll be happy to know

2279
01:34:07.220 --> 01:34:09.440
your daughter has been quite the adventurer.

2280
01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:11.310
She's accomplished quite a bit.

2281
01:34:11.310 --> 01:34:13.568
MATT: "Really? Oh, I knew she would.

2282
01:34:13.568 --> 01:34:15.151
"What have you done?"

2283
01:34:17.313 --> 01:34:21.380
LAURA: Oh, well, you remember the Traveler?

2284
01:34:23.460 --> 01:34:25.860
MATT: "I remember you talking quite a bit about him

2285
01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:28.270
"since you were very little, yes."

2286
01:34:28.270 --> 01:34:31.078
LAURA: Turns out he's not a god.

2287
01:34:33.210 --> 01:34:36.015
MATT: "Every child comes to a point in their life..."

2288
01:34:36.015 --> 01:34:39.898
[laughter]

2289
01:34:41.149 --> 01:34:44.576
"...where things-- fleets of fancy

2290
01:34:44.576 --> 01:34:46.120
"and imagination from childhood--"

2291
01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:49.560
LAURA: I mean, he's real, Mama! He's still real.

2292
01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:50.493
MATT: "Of course."

2293
01:34:50.493 --> 01:34:53.701
[laughter]

2294
01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:58.006
LIAM: Sorry to interject--
ASHLEY: We actually met him.

2295
01:34:58.006 --> 01:35:02.290
LIAM: Not a god, but we have all,
in fact, met this individual.

2296
01:35:02.290 --> 01:35:05.021
TRAVIS: It's true.
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

2297
01:35:05.021 --> 01:35:06.362
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2298
01:35:09.460 --> 01:35:11.855
MATT: "Who is it, is she is safe?

2299
01:35:11.855 --> 01:35:13.760
[laughter]

2300
01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:14.830
"I told you to take care of her."

2301
01:35:14.830 --> 01:35:17.255
TRAVIS: No, I did, we've
taken that very seriously.

2302
01:35:17.255 --> 01:35:18.480
She is quite safe.

2303
01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:20.604
MARISHA: It's a little predatory
though, let's be honest.

2304
01:35:20.604 --> 01:35:21.437
TRAVIS: No!

2305
01:35:21.437 --> 01:35:23.620
[laughter]

2306
01:35:23.620 --> 01:35:24.637
N-no, that's--

2307
01:35:24.637 --> 01:35:25.470
No!

2308
01:35:28.061 --> 01:35:31.270
MARISHA: A grown man was sneaking
into a young girl's bedroom

2309
01:35:31.270 --> 01:35:32.853
all the time, what?

2310
01:35:33.736 --> 01:35:36.100
I mean, it turned out okay.

2311
01:35:36.100 --> 01:35:39.060
Like, it's fine, but--

2312
01:35:39.060 --> 01:35:42.790
TRAVIS: She's actually in more
control than you might imagine.

2313
01:35:42.790 --> 01:35:45.510
She actually is dictating quite a bit

2314
01:35:45.510 --> 01:35:47.960
of what happens in this relationship.

2315
01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:50.390
MARISHA: Yeah, If anything, she's the god.

2316
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:52.153
MATT: "That's my girl."

2317
01:35:52.153 --> 01:35:55.128
[cheering]

2318
01:35:55.128 --> 01:35:56.428
"I knew it."

2319
01:36:00.740 --> 01:36:04.610
LIAM: No, but seriously, he is an ancient fey being.

2320
01:36:04.610 --> 01:36:06.368
It's complicated.

2321
01:36:07.410 --> 01:36:09.151
MARISHA: Kind of like Frumpkin.

2322
01:36:10.651 --> 01:36:12.625
But, like, a man.

2323
01:36:13.740 --> 01:36:16.410
LAURA: And, like, really old and has lots of power,

2324
01:36:16.410 --> 01:36:17.886
but looks young, super handsome.

2325
01:36:17.886 --> 01:36:20.275
MATT: "Oh, I know all about that."

2326
01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:27.600
LAURA: Wait a minute, Mama, did you ever-- okay.

2327
01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:30.570
You remember how I told you he had no face?
Like, I couldn't see his face?

2328
01:36:30.570 --> 01:36:32.739
MATT: "Right."
LAURA: I know what he looks like now.

2329
01:36:32.739 --> 01:36:33.580
MATT: "Oh!"

2330
01:36:33.580 --> 01:36:37.890
LAURA: Did you ever meet a
man who had fiery red hair,

2331
01:36:37.890 --> 01:36:41.380
super fluffy and he had very handsome,

2332
01:36:41.380 --> 01:36:45.980
vibrant green eyes and
really large eyebrows,

2333
01:36:45.980 --> 01:36:47.840
but in a good way?

2334
01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:50.810
MATT: "I have seen such a
man occasionally downstairs

2335
01:36:50.810 --> 01:36:52.980
in the Chateau, but not as a client.

2336
01:36:52.980 --> 01:36:55.714
LAURA: That's him, that is him!

2337
01:36:57.520 --> 01:36:59.295
MATT: "I don't know if this makes it less weird."

2338
01:36:59.295 --> 01:37:01.560
[laughter]

2339
01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:05.842
"But it's good to have a
face to the name, I suppose.

2340
01:37:05.842 --> 01:37:06.767
"Are you okay?"

2341
01:37:06.767 --> 01:37:10.077
LAURA: I'm kind of glad that
he wasn't ever a client.

2342
01:37:11.670 --> 01:37:13.620
MATT: "In hindsight, me as well."

2343
01:37:13.620 --> 01:37:17.282
[laughter]

2344
01:37:17.282 --> 01:37:19.565
LAURA: Hey, you're invited to
a party, do you want to come?

2345
01:37:19.565 --> 01:37:21.934
TALIESIN: (disapproving grunting)

2346
01:37:21.934 --> 01:37:23.400
MATT: "What kind of a party is--"

2347
01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:25.966
SAM: There's a party's tomorrow at the Marquis' demesne.

2348
01:37:25.966 --> 01:37:27.270
LAURA: Yeah, yeah!

2349
01:37:27.270 --> 01:37:30.478
They said you can come
perform if you want to.

2350
01:37:30.478 --> 01:37:32.453
MATT: "I-- uh...

2351
01:37:32.453 --> 01:37:34.583
"That's a few blocks."

2352
01:37:34.583 --> 01:37:36.310
LAURA: I know.

2353
01:37:36.310 --> 01:37:37.820
MATT: "Are you going to this?"

2354
01:37:37.820 --> 01:37:38.900
LAURA: Yeah.

2355
01:37:38.900 --> 01:37:40.750
I would go with you if you wanted.

2356
01:37:40.750 --> 01:37:41.890
MATT: "And you're all going?"

2357
01:37:41.890 --> 01:37:43.370
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2358
01:37:43.370 --> 01:37:45.428
MARISHA: We can keep you safe.

2359
01:37:45.428 --> 01:37:47.561
TALIESIN: That's a...

2360
01:37:49.460 --> 01:37:51.130
LAURA: What's wrong, Caduceus?

2361
01:37:51.130 --> 01:37:56.130
TALIESIN: I thought we all agreed
that this was a little tricky

2362
01:37:57.150 --> 01:37:57.983
going into this party.

2363
01:37:57.983 --> 01:38:00.375
Are we sure we want to just treat it like a party

2364
01:38:00.375 --> 01:38:04.440
or were we going to be, hmm, you know.
LIAM: I think everyone who is attending

2365
01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:08.040
this event wants it to go smoothly.

2366
01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:11.898
For it to be a lovely evening and, Jester,

2367
01:38:11.898 --> 01:38:16.347
your mother is very talented and beautiful

2368
01:38:16.347 --> 01:38:19.648
and everyone in this town
obviously is fascinated with her

2369
01:38:19.648 --> 01:38:21.765
and she would be an excellent...

2370
01:38:23.478 --> 01:38:26.478
[laughter]

2371
01:38:27.548 --> 01:38:29.356
MATT: "Don't let me stop you."

2372
01:38:29.356 --> 01:38:31.387
[laughter]

2373
01:38:31.387 --> 01:38:32.220
TALIESIN: I feel so much better.

2374
01:38:32.220 --> 01:38:33.694
Yasha just kept mentioned killing people

2375
01:38:33.694 --> 01:38:36.878
so I just assumed things
were going to just go...

2376
01:38:36.878 --> 01:38:40.490
ASHLEY: That's just my go-to, I don't know.

2377
01:38:40.490 --> 01:38:43.106
LIAM: My point being, who
could take their eyes off of

2378
01:38:43.106 --> 01:38:45.556
the Ruby of the Sea at a party like this?

2379
01:38:45.556 --> 01:38:46.780
LAURA: Very true.

2380
01:38:46.780 --> 01:38:48.860
MARISHA: Plus going to a party with your mom

2381
01:38:48.860 --> 01:38:50.860
is a pretty great cover.

2382
01:38:51.863 --> 01:38:54.088
LAURA: Oh, I should have asked if

2383
01:38:55.338 --> 01:38:58.171
Lord Sharpe was going to be there.

2384
01:38:59.454 --> 01:39:02.230
MATT: "There is probably a good
chance of him being there

2385
01:39:02.230 --> 01:39:06.228
"seeing as how he is one of the
more powerful nobles in Nicodranas

2386
01:39:06.228 --> 01:39:10.422
"and it is a party that is in the Opal Archways,

2387
01:39:10.422 --> 01:39:12.988
"so there's a good chance he'll be there

2388
01:39:12.988 --> 01:39:14.630
"so maybe be discreet."

2389
01:39:14.630 --> 01:39:16.610
TRAVIS: We certainly don't
want to make you uncomfortable.

2390
01:39:16.610 --> 01:39:19.111
Your daughter has helped broker peace between--

2391
01:39:19.111 --> 01:39:20.961
MATT: "Oh, Sharpe I can handle, don't worry.

2392
01:39:20.961 --> 01:39:23.353
"I handle men like him all the time.

2393
01:39:24.990 --> 01:39:26.974
"And they are very easy to handle.

2394
01:39:26.974 --> 01:39:29.540
[laughter]
[cheering]

2395
01:39:29.540 --> 01:39:32.255
"Just be careful, if you don't mind.
LAURA: Okay.

2396
01:39:32.255 --> 01:39:34.950
MATT: "If you are all going to be there,

2397
01:39:34.950 --> 01:39:38.235
"and you, my Sapphire,
are going to be there,"

2398
01:39:40.150 --> 01:39:41.623
and she reaches out and takes your hand

2399
01:39:41.623 --> 01:39:43.060
and squeezes it.

2400
01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:45.518
"Then...

2401
01:39:45.518 --> 01:39:46.893
"I can be there."

2402
01:39:47.914 --> 01:39:48.964
MARISHA: Yeah!

2403
01:39:48.964 --> 01:39:53.172
[cheering]

2404
01:39:53.172 --> 01:39:54.860
LAURA: I give her a big hug.

2405
01:39:54.860 --> 01:39:56.290
MARISHA: This party is going to be dope.

2406
01:39:56.290 --> 01:39:57.556
LAURA: I'm so proud of you, Mama!

2407
01:39:57.556 --> 01:39:59.948
I'm so proud of you.

2408
01:39:59.948 --> 01:40:02.225
MATT: "We're not there yet, so don't think that--

2409
01:40:02.225 --> 01:40:04.770
"but I'm going to work on it.

2410
01:40:04.770 --> 01:40:09.453
"I've been working on my...

2411
01:40:09.453 --> 01:40:11.478
"excursions a bit, so."

2412
01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:16.920
At this point you can hear
from the steps coming up.

2413
01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:19.111
(as Yeza) "I couldn't find any, like,

2414
01:40:19.111 --> 01:40:21.561
"bread that was as fresh as we hoped for."

2415
01:40:21.561 --> 01:40:24.360
And you hear Yeza as he's coming up the stairs.

2416
01:40:26.164 --> 01:40:29.052
[laughter]

2417
01:40:29.052 --> 01:40:30.302
TRAVIS: What about that pillow?

2418
01:40:32.944 --> 01:40:35.194
MATT: "Oh, wow, you're...

2419
01:40:36.069 --> 01:40:38.794
"You're all Veth's friends, it's good to see you."

2420
01:40:38.794 --> 01:40:41.283
LIAM: Yeza, hello, it is so good to see you again.

2421
01:40:41.283 --> 01:40:42.949
MATT: "Caleb, Beauregard."

2422
01:40:42.949 --> 01:40:43.782
MARISHA: Nailed it.

2423
01:40:43.782 --> 01:40:46.391
MATT: "Fjord, Yasha, Caduceus,

01:40:47.241 --> 01:40:48.641
"Jester, of course.

"It's so good to see you guys.

2426
01:40:49.824 --> 01:40:51.970
"Where's my wife?"

2427
01:40:51.970 --> 01:40:54.050
LIAM: Soon following on our heels.

2428
01:40:54.050 --> 01:40:55.190
She will be here soon.

2429
01:40:55.190 --> 01:40:59.330
MATT: "Wonderful. I got to go
put these groceries away.

2430
01:40:59.330 --> 01:41:00.720
"Marion, got it all taken care of.

2431
01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:02.145
"I'll just give you the bill

01:41:02.145 --> 01:41:04.203
"and I'll be back in a little bit.

01:41:05.944 --> 01:41:06.969
"Bye."

2434
01:41:06.969 --> 01:41:08.820
And you see him now, heads back downstairs,

2435
01:41:08.820 --> 01:41:10.220
a little spring in his step.

2436
01:41:10.220 --> 01:41:13.553
LAURA: Oh, I bet he's going
to go wash his junk off.

2437
01:41:13.553 --> 01:41:15.936
[laughter]

2438
01:41:15.936 --> 01:41:17.353
SAM: What do you mean, what--?

2439
01:41:18.854 --> 01:41:21.768
Oh, because he knows that I'm coming.

2440
01:41:21.768 --> 01:41:24.371
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: Oh, okay.

2441
01:41:24.371 --> 01:41:26.030
Like a little prep.

2442
01:41:26.030 --> 01:41:27.938
LAURA: (sweetly) Yeah.

2443
01:41:27.938 --> 01:41:29.210
SAM: I better do the same.

2444
01:41:29.210 --> 01:41:31.760
LAURA: Yeah, well we're going to a bathroom.

2445
01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:36.135
LIAM: You know, just a little bit of revivification.

2446
01:41:36.135 --> 01:41:37.543
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

2447
01:41:38.820 --> 01:41:41.820
MATT: "Well, I was not performing tonight.

2448
01:41:42.787 --> 01:41:44.188
"I was planning to perform at the Chateau tomorrow,

2449
01:41:44.188 --> 01:41:46.738
"but I can cancel that easy

2450
01:41:46.738 --> 01:41:47.704
"and be ready for this party."
LAURA: Are you sure?

2451
01:41:47.704 --> 01:41:49.046
MATT: "Of course!

2452
01:41:49.046 --> 01:41:51.713
"I run this place, are you kidding me?

2453
01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:56.295
"Well, thank you for keeping her safe.

2454
01:41:57.860 --> 01:42:00.980
"And I look forward to this event tomorrow night.

2455
01:42:00.980 --> 01:42:03.040
"And of course, Jester, it's so good to see you.

2456
01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:04.580
LAURA: You too, mama.

2457
01:42:04.580 --> 01:42:07.580
MATT: "All right, well I should...

2458
01:42:07.580 --> 01:42:09.893
"or at least I want to finish
my book, if you don't mind.

2459
01:42:09.893 --> 01:42:13.122
LAURA: Of course we'll go to the bathroom.

2460
01:42:14.372 --> 01:42:16.005
MATT: "Right."
TRAVIS: Oh, to put the clay, yeah.

2461
01:42:16.005 --> 01:42:17.396
LAURA: Yeah, okay.

2462
01:42:18.340 --> 01:42:19.852
MATT: "Have fun."

2463
01:42:19.852 --> 01:42:22.280
[laughter]

2464
01:42:22.280 --> 01:42:26.640
She goes and lays back in her
bed and pulls open her book.

2465
01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:29.635
SAM: Maybe we should, like,
turn on a fan or something, to--

2466
01:42:31.290 --> 01:42:33.600
LIAM: This bathroom is enormous.

2467
01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:35.740
LAURA: Yeah, it's pretty wonderful.

2468
01:42:35.740 --> 01:42:37.740
ASHLEY: Should I put this in the tub?

2469
01:42:37.740 --> 01:42:39.256
LAURA: Hold on, hold on, let me--

2470
01:42:39.256 --> 01:42:43.756
I'm just going to lay one of the green cloaks

2471
01:42:43.756 --> 01:42:46.114
in the tub,

2472
01:42:46.114 --> 01:42:49.022
just to keep the tub from getting stained with clay.

2473
01:42:49.022 --> 01:42:52.128
MATT: Okay, you lay the cloak down within the tub

2474
01:42:52.128 --> 01:42:53.090
and it's a beautiful tub.

2475
01:42:53.090 --> 01:42:57.933
It's one of those classic, long,

2476
01:42:57.933 --> 01:43:00.790
claw-footed bathtubs,

2477
01:43:00.790 --> 01:43:02.820
like a silver rim on the edge.

2478
01:43:02.820 --> 01:43:06.667
You can see this was probably a gift to Marion.

2479
01:43:06.667 --> 01:43:07.500
It's beautiful.

2480
01:43:07.500 --> 01:43:09.140
MARISHA: We're about to demolish this tub.

2481
01:43:09.140 --> 01:43:11.820
LAURA: No, no, no!

2482
01:43:11.820 --> 01:43:16.540
MATT: You set the cloak within, put the clay in there,

2483
01:43:16.540 --> 01:43:18.303
situate a small pocket of it

2484
01:43:18.303 --> 01:43:21.664
where Nott can lay into

2485
01:43:21.664 --> 01:43:24.500
and it is like-- it's a very, very tiny element

2486
01:43:24.500 --> 01:43:26.910
that, like a tub within in a tub

2487
01:43:26.910 --> 01:43:29.690
and Nott, you can get into there fairly easily.

2488
01:43:29.690 --> 01:43:33.300
SAM: Sure, yeah, I'll break invisibility and go in.

2489
01:43:33.300 --> 01:43:35.100
LIAM: This is going to take a while

2490
01:43:35.100 --> 01:43:36.966
and I pull out a bit of red ribbon

2491
01:43:36.966 --> 01:43:38.691
and tie it in a bow on the knob

2492
01:43:38.691 --> 01:43:40.967
on the outside of the door and close it.

2493
01:43:40.967 --> 01:43:44.392
[laughter]

2494
01:43:44.392 --> 01:43:45.800
MARISHA: Smart.
TRAVIS: What's that for?

2495
01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:47.756
MARISHA: They'll know.

2496
01:43:47.756 --> 01:43:50.370
[laughter]

2497
01:43:50.370 --> 01:43:53.045
LIAM: We need about hour of privacy.

2498
01:43:56.010 --> 01:43:57.760
LAURA: They won't come in.

2499
01:43:59.361 --> 01:44:03.390
MATT: All right, Nott as you settle into the clay

2500
01:44:03.390 --> 01:44:05.598
and find this thin pocket

2501
01:44:05.598 --> 01:44:06.660
that bends around you

2502
01:44:06.660 --> 01:44:08.726
because it's not terribly thick,

2503
01:44:08.726 --> 01:44:11.634
but enough where you can at least

2504
01:44:11.634 --> 01:44:14.670
feel like you're cradled within.

2505
01:44:14.670 --> 01:44:16.710
LAURA: Caleb, what do I do with all this glitter?

2506
01:44:16.710 --> 01:44:20.192
LIAM: Hold on a moment and I hold out my hand to Nott.

2507
01:44:22.310 --> 01:44:24.860
You sure you are ready?

2508
01:44:24.860 --> 01:44:26.190
SAM: No!

2509
01:44:26.190 --> 01:44:27.890
[laughter]

2510
01:44:27.890 --> 01:44:29.673
But I'm going to do it anyway.

2511
01:44:30.607 --> 01:44:34.857
[cheering]

2512
01:44:36.816 --> 01:44:40.070
SAM: And I'm not sure what will happen afterwards,

2513
01:44:40.070 --> 01:44:44.378
but you know, no matter what,

2514
01:44:44.378 --> 01:44:46.700
you guys will help me get through it.

2515
01:44:46.700 --> 01:44:50.956
And if for some reason I don't come back

2516
01:44:50.956 --> 01:44:54.964
or come back different or leave or something,

2517
01:44:55.840 --> 01:44:58.370
you know how much you all mean to me

2518
01:44:58.370 --> 01:45:03.370
and Jester, I hope we have more adventures together.

2519
01:45:03.828 --> 01:45:04.830
LAURA: Me, too.

2520
01:45:04.830 --> 01:45:06.690
I give Nott a kiss on the nose.

2521
01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:10.427
SAM: Caduceus, thank you for being honest

2522
01:45:10.427 --> 01:45:14.890
and showing us that you can be scared, too.

2523
01:45:14.890 --> 01:45:16.223
And that's okay.

2524
01:45:17.556 --> 01:45:21.450
Yasha, I'm, like, 60% sure you're not evil now.

2525
01:45:21.450 --> 01:45:24.790
[laughter]

2526
01:45:24.790 --> 01:45:27.100
ASHLEY: That should be a lower percentage.

2527
01:45:27.100 --> 01:45:29.240
(laughter)

2528
01:45:29.240 --> 01:45:31.740
Would you like a sip of your wine?

2529
01:45:32.940 --> 01:45:34.465
SAM: No, thanks.

2530
01:45:34.465 --> 01:45:39.448
[cheering]

2531
01:45:42.580 --> 01:45:46.145
Fjord, I'm sorry that I always call you weak,

2532
01:45:46.145 --> 01:45:47.580
but I only do that

2533
01:45:47.580 --> 01:45:50.169
because I know you're strong enough to take it.

2534
01:45:50.169 --> 01:45:53.578
[awwing]

2535
01:45:53.578 --> 01:45:58.578
Beau, thank you for taking care of Mr. Caleb.

2536
01:45:58.750 --> 01:46:03.658
And Caleb, you know, I love you

2537
01:46:05.100 --> 01:46:09.382
and you're the second love of my life.

2538
01:46:11.220 --> 01:46:13.303
Thank you for being with me.

2539
01:46:15.500 --> 01:46:19.105
LIAM: I love you, too.

2540
01:46:19.105 --> 01:46:22.092
[cheering]

2541
01:46:25.030 --> 01:46:27.497
Veth the Brave.

2542
01:46:30.850 --> 01:46:32.267
SAM: Well, we'll see.

2543
01:46:33.491 --> 01:46:35.958
All right, glitter me, Jester.

2544
01:46:35.958 --> 01:46:37.791
LAURA: Can I, can I, can I?

2545
01:46:38.949 --> 01:46:40.557
Glitter bomb!

2546
01:46:44.242 --> 01:46:47.472
LIAM: That was more of an antiquing than I was anticipating,

2547
01:46:47.472 --> 01:46:49.389
but it will do the job.

2548
01:46:50.703 --> 01:46:51.980
All right, everybody have a seat.

2549
01:46:51.980 --> 01:46:53.738
This is going to take a while.

2550
01:46:54.710 --> 01:46:56.951
MATT: As you all situate into this now

2551
01:46:56.951 --> 01:46:59.340
somewhat cramped bathroom,

2552
01:46:59.340 --> 01:47:02.590
you go ahead and begin to set up the necessary

2553
01:47:02.590 --> 01:47:05.031
ritual components, making the appropriate

2554
01:47:05.031 --> 01:47:06.260
sigils on the floor,

2555
01:47:06.260 --> 01:47:07.540
setting up the candles,

2556
01:47:08.750 --> 01:47:11.960
having Beau aid you in burning the proper incense

2557
01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:15.560
to begin to get the energy centered

2558
01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:19.120
and focused on this particular tub.

2559
01:47:19.120 --> 01:47:21.340
As you initiate the first rise of this ritual,

2560
01:47:21.340 --> 01:47:24.040
you can see some of these symbols begin to glow

2561
01:47:24.040 --> 01:47:27.180
that same faint color you saw in Essek's tower.

2562
01:47:27.180 --> 01:47:28.810
As they begin to grow brighter and brighter,

2563
01:47:28.810 --> 01:47:30.993
you can see the clay begin to slowly form

2564
01:47:30.993 --> 01:47:33.493
on its own around Nott's body.

2565
01:47:34.620 --> 01:47:36.820
As at that moment as the clay creates

2566
01:47:36.820 --> 01:47:40.580
this thin barrier around the entirety of Nott form,

2567
01:47:40.580 --> 01:47:43.480
eventually covering the face and the eyes,

2568
01:47:43.480 --> 01:47:48.480
you, Caleb can feel yourself connecting on a very mental,

2569
01:47:49.010 --> 01:47:53.320
psychic emotional level as part of this with Nott.

2570
01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:57.950
And in that connection, you urge Nott

2571
01:47:57.950 --> 01:48:01.442
to think of her true form,

2572
01:48:01.442 --> 01:48:05.440
who she always was and hopefully always will be.

2573
01:48:06.620 --> 01:48:09.570
As you both sit there and concentrate,

2574
01:48:09.570 --> 01:48:14.280
pushing into the next level of glyphs on the ground,

2575
01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:16.150
glowing brighter and brighter,

2576
01:48:16.150 --> 01:48:17.925
the clay begins to harden and warm up.

2577
01:48:17.925 --> 01:48:19.600
And you can feel the clay getting hot

2578
01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:22.732
on your body to a point where it's alarming,

2579
01:48:22.732 --> 01:48:25.220
but not too much to take.

2580
01:48:25.220 --> 01:48:29.710
And it's extended for minutes and minutes and minutes.

2581
01:48:29.710 --> 01:48:32.930
This heat is there, but you hold tight to the trust

2582
01:48:32.930 --> 01:48:35.170
as part of this and all of you quietly just watch on

2583
01:48:35.170 --> 01:48:37.980
as Caleb mutters the incantations under his breath,

2584
01:48:37.980 --> 01:48:40.013
his eyes in a trance.

2585
01:48:40.013 --> 01:48:42.696
Eventually, the clay begins to go orange hot.

2586
01:48:42.696 --> 01:48:45.130
It doesn't burn you, but it begins to just

2587
01:48:45.130 --> 01:48:48.677
brighten and brighten and brighten.

2588
01:48:50.660 --> 01:48:53.180
The outside light of the small glass windows

2589
01:48:53.180 --> 01:48:56.130
in the chamber begin to slightly darken.

2590
01:48:56.130 --> 01:49:00.495
The chamber becoming fainter and fainter.

2591
01:49:00.495 --> 01:49:02.560
As the shadow swells around it,

2592
01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:06.150
the glowing clay form of Nott's goblin body begins to emit

2593
01:49:06.150 --> 01:49:09.580
this bright orange light.

2594
01:49:09.580 --> 01:49:12.360
You push into the next wave of incantations,

2595
01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:14.400
getting louder and louder.

2596
01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:17.240
The windows themselves seem to black out at this point.

2597
01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:18.630
There is no daylight making its way in.

2598
01:49:18.630 --> 01:49:21.200
The only light source you see are the glowing glyphs

2599
01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:23.410
steadily circling the base of this tub

2600
01:49:23.410 --> 01:49:28.383
and the slightly lifting clay form of Nott.

2601
01:49:29.810 --> 01:49:31.852
As you finish the final rights,

2602
01:49:33.690 --> 01:49:36.418
you finished the incantation with a shout.

2603
01:49:37.500 --> 01:49:40.470
The clay shatters across the room.

2604
01:49:40.470 --> 01:49:42.760
All of you are pushed back from the impact

2605
01:49:42.760 --> 01:49:43.920
of this arcane shockwave.

2606
01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:47.970

there is still an orange form

2612
01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:08.830
healthier and more halfling.

2613
01:50:10.820 --> 01:50:13.637
As the light begins to fate and the body drifts down

2641
01:52:02.300 --> 01:52:05.584

Well, I love you all,

MATT: You see there a look of panic in his eyes,

2662
01:53:13.660 --> 01:53:17.743
your husband, who immediately goes from, like, a...

2665
01:53:23.938 --> 01:53:26.636

2667
01:53:38.990 --> 01:53:41.682
MATT: "Wait." After he breaks apart. "Wait!"

2668
01:53:43.692 --> 01:53:45.792
SAM: It felt different, right?

2669
01:53:45.792 --> 01:53:47.750
MATT: "There's-- There's not as much teeth."

2670
01:53:47.750 --> 01:53:49.320
SAM: No, no.

2671
01:53:49.320 --> 01:53:51.330
There's, like, a regular amount of teeth.

2672
01:53:51.330 --> 01:53:53.645
MATT: And he just grabs you and kisses you again.

2674
01:53:59.054 --> 01:54:01.912

MATT: "I'm so happy to have you back,"

2676
01:54:07.970 --> 01:54:09.540
and you can see just, like, tears

2677
01:54:09.540 --> 01:54:11.290
coming down his face.

2678
01:54:12.723 --> 01:54:15.419

MATT: (whoosh, thud)

2680
01:54:16.343 --> 01:54:19.885
You immediately get hit in the forehead

2681
01:54:19.885 --> 01:54:24.094
with a wooden crossbow bolt.
SAM: Fuck.

01:54:29.160 --> 01:54:30.710
MATT: (as Luc) "I've been practicing!"

2685
01:54:30.710 --> 01:54:35.626
SAM: Yeah, you have! That was good! That was good.

2686
01:54:35.626 --> 01:54:37.533
I'll teach you about

2687
01:54:37.533 --> 01:54:40.230
how to keep below the neck for indoor shots.

2690
01:54:44.730 --> 01:54:46.780
MATT: And he runs up and gives you a big hug.

2691
01:54:48.120 --> 01:54:49.890
As he's holding you,

2692
01:54:49.890 --> 01:54:52.607
you can see your husband just

2693
01:54:52.607 --> 01:54:53.740
looking back at you with a smile

2694
01:54:53.740 --> 01:54:57.823
and then it looks briefly at all of you and goes,

2695
01:54:59.730 --> 01:55:01.446
"Thank you.

2696
01:55:04.538 --> 01:55:06.540
"Thank you."

TRAVIS: Thank you for sharing her
with us as long as you have.

2698

She's been amazing.

2703
01:55:31.280 --> 01:55:34.080
A little bit weaker, too.

[laughter]

2705
01:55:35.470 --> 01:55:37.240
I might need to lie down.

2706
01:55:37.240 --> 01:55:38.881
MATT: "Yeah, no, of course," which by the way,

2707
01:55:38.881 --> 01:55:40.280
both of you guys do have a point of exhaustion

2708
01:55:40.280 --> 01:55:41.613
from the completion of the spell.

2709
01:55:41.613 --> 01:55:43.050

(electronic drum beats)

2790
01:59:52.010 --> 01:59:53.277
MISTY: You got them both, do you guys know?
SAM: Yep.

2791
01:59:53.277 --> 01:59:54.368
LIAM: Yeah.
ASHLY: Yeah.

2792
01:59:56.165 --> 01:59:56.998
LIAM: What the fuck?

2793
01:59:56.998 --> 01:59:57.831
SAM: How, what, that's impossible.

2794
01:59:57.831 --> 01:59:58.720
ASHLY: How did you...

2795
01:59:58.720 --> 02:00:00.780
MISTY: Right here is the one pair of handcuffs

2796
02:00:00.780 --> 02:00:03.660
from which Houdini could not escape.

2797
02:00:03.660 --> 02:00:07.320
Then you can actually ask this owl yes or no questions.

2798
02:00:07.320 --> 02:00:09.720
SAM: Will I die a painful death?

2799
02:00:09.720 --> 02:00:12.120
Hey, that's good.
ASHLY: That's nice.

2800
02:00:12.120 --> 02:00:15.110
ASHLY: Do you have any martial arts background or anything?

2801
02:00:17.590 --> 02:00:19.507
LIAM: One more time.

2802
02:00:20.648 --> 02:00:22.330
MISTY: Yes, yes!

2803
02:00:22.330 --> 02:00:24.580
SAM: And then, I've seen magicians do this where they.

2804
02:00:24.580 --> 02:00:25.413
(chain rattling)

2805
02:00:25.413 --> 02:00:27.137
MISTY: Definitely!

2806
02:00:27.137 --> 02:00:30.011
ASHLY: Put some mustard on it, okay.

2807
02:00:30.011 --> 02:00:31.703
MISTY: Yeah, girl!
ASHLY: But don't do that face.

2808
02:00:31.703 --> 02:00:32.761
SAM: Oh, oh, oh.

2809
02:00:32.761 --> 02:00:37.418
(laughter, groans)

2810
02:00:37.418 --> 02:00:38.251
ASHLY: Magic.

2811
02:00:38.251 --> 02:00:43.159
(upbeat, jazzy music)

2812
02:00:45.130 --> 02:00:47.750
BRIAN (V.O.): Last time on Talks Machina.

2813
02:00:47.750 --> 02:00:50.100
BRIAN: Caduceus, played so brilliantly

2814
02:00:50.100 --> 02:00:53.108
by you, Taliesin, since your previous character

2815
02:00:53.108 --> 02:00:56.649
was murdered by TV's Ashly Burch,

2816
02:00:56.649 --> 02:00:58.104
got the straw hat.

2817
02:00:58.104 --> 02:00:59.945
(laughter)

2818
02:00:59.945 --> 02:01:01.445
DANI: Brian!

2819
02:01:01.445 --> 02:01:03.019
BRIAN: What? It says it,

2820
02:01:03.019 --> 02:01:06.013
look, take it up with CritRoleStats.
DANI: No, it says nothing of the sort.

2821
02:01:06.013 --> 02:01:07.063
TALIESIN: I told you that she texted me,

2822
02:01:07.063 --> 02:01:08.590
I was on the way to Comic-Con, she's like,

2823
02:01:08.590 --> 02:01:09.423
we're on the train.
BRIAN: Yeah, she was on the train.

2824
02:01:09.423 --> 02:01:12.230
TALIESIN: There's a Molly cosplayer
and they're giving me the eye.

2825
02:01:12.230 --> 02:01:13.445
I don't know what to do.

2826
02:01:13.445 --> 02:01:14.456
(laughter)

2827
02:01:14.456 --> 02:01:15.289
BRIAN: Yep, it's going to follow her around

2828
02:01:15.289 --> 02:01:17.450
for the rest of her goddamn life hopefully.

2829
02:01:17.450 --> 02:01:19.741
LIAM: Hey, Burch, that's your bed. You made it.

2830
02:01:19.741 --> 02:01:21.152
Now you got to sleep in it.

2831
02:01:21.152 --> 02:01:22.360
BRIAN: "Now that we've got to meet all the Clays

2832
02:01:22.360 --> 02:01:25.090
"in their pastel goth, Addams Family-like glory."

2833
02:01:25.090 --> 02:01:26.290
TALIESIN: I love that.

2834
02:01:26.290 --> 02:01:29.350
BRIAN: "Would you mind expanding a
bit on Caduceus' relationship

2835
02:01:29.350 --> 02:01:31.400
"with his siblings, parent, and aunt?"

2836
02:01:31.400 --> 02:01:33.463
TALIESIN: I always thought of him as

2837
02:01:33.463 --> 02:01:36.110
kind of, at least from a family perspective

2838
02:01:36.110 --> 02:01:37.360
of what would have happened to Percy

2839
02:01:37.360 --> 02:01:38.980
if nothing had gone horribly wrong,

2840
02:01:38.980 --> 02:01:41.505
which is he was the kid who was perfectly okay

2841
02:01:41.505 --> 02:01:43.480
staying to run the family business

2842
02:01:43.480 --> 02:01:45.560
while everyone went off and did their own thing.

2843
02:01:45.560 --> 02:01:48.220
He was like, I've got this, this is fine.

2844
02:01:48.220 --> 02:01:49.910
I don't need to leave home.

2845
02:01:49.910 --> 02:01:53.050
I'm not interested in any of that.

2846
02:01:53.050 --> 02:01:56.390
This is, I enjoy running the shrine

2847
02:01:56.390 --> 02:01:57.560
and I'm just going to stay and do that.

2848
02:01:57.560 --> 02:01:58.740
The rest of the kids can go off

2849
02:01:58.740 --> 02:02:00.920
and do whatever it is that they're going to do.

2850
02:02:00.920 --> 02:02:04.270
So I think the rest of the kids,

2851
02:02:05.790 --> 02:02:08.370
wanderlust probably put them at odds quite a bit

2852
02:02:08.370 --> 02:02:10.870
and was probably a lot of that.

2853
02:02:10.870 --> 02:02:12.840
I was really looking forward to playing that contention

2854
02:02:12.840 --> 02:02:14.700
and seeing what Clay was going to be like

2855
02:02:14.700 --> 02:02:18.341
when he had people who irritated him.

2856
02:02:18.341 --> 02:02:19.265
(laughter)

2857
02:02:19.265 --> 02:02:23.040
BRIAN: "Caleb has now witnessed four family reunions

2858
02:02:23.040 --> 02:02:26.020
"between Jester, Nott, Beau, and now Caduceus.

2859
02:02:26.020 --> 02:02:28.720
"How's he feeling about his
own parents and his found family,

2860
02:02:28.720 --> 02:02:32.270
"especially with Nott, saying she may leave them?"

2861
02:02:32.270 --> 02:02:34.845
LIAM: Caleb very unfamiliar with it.

2862
02:02:36.420 --> 02:02:41.378
Jester and her mom were loving and super unique that pair,

2863
02:02:41.378 --> 02:02:45.610
but a loving, family just like Caleb's was

2864
02:02:45.610 --> 02:02:48.715
and just, his was ruined.

2865
02:02:51.450 --> 02:02:55.230
And then he thinks about Nott slash Veth

2866
02:02:55.230 --> 02:02:58.010
and how she's with us and, he'll never judge her.

2867
02:02:58.010 --> 02:02:59.450
He'll never judge anybody, because he can't,

2868
02:02:59.450 --> 02:03:02.070
but he always wonders like, my god,

2869
02:03:03.100 --> 02:03:05.960
everything I do has been based around my parents

2870
02:03:05.960 --> 02:03:10.960
and wanting to rebuild my family

2871
02:03:11.330 --> 02:03:14.620
and she's here and she doesn't want to go back.

2872
02:03:14.620 --> 02:03:18.660
And it just goes to show the unlimited variation

2873
02:03:18.660 --> 02:03:21.540
of the living-- well, I would say human on our planet,

2874
02:03:21.540 --> 02:03:25.039
but in this one, the living experience of people

2875
02:03:25.039 --> 02:03:28.240
wanting different things or needing different things

2876
02:03:28.240 --> 02:03:29.270
and he doesn't understand it,

2877
02:03:29.270 --> 02:03:30.720
but he obviously would never push her.

2878
02:03:30.720 --> 02:03:32.760
He would never push anyone for anything.

2879
02:03:32.760 --> 02:03:34.769
BRIAN: "Cad and Nott have reached their goals

2880
02:03:34.769 --> 02:03:39.327
"of what drove them to leave their homes slash families,

2881
02:03:39.327 --> 02:03:41.940
"and it makes sense if they were to leave the Mighty Nein.

2882
02:03:41.940 --> 02:03:44.050
"What is keeping Cad with the Mighty Nein,

2883
02:03:44.050 --> 02:03:46.870
"and how do you feel Cad's and Nott's situations differ?"

2884
02:03:47.780 --> 02:03:50.655
TALIESIN: He has an intense debt to pay

2885
02:03:50.655 --> 02:03:55.100
that he feels that he has a mission

2886
02:03:55.100 --> 02:03:58.610
to see everybody else through

2887
02:03:59.560 --> 02:04:03.430
at the very least, or at least he's telling himself that.

2888
02:04:03.430 --> 02:04:08.430
So he saved his home or at least he thinks he saved his home

2889
02:04:09.429 --> 02:04:11.054
and his family are all right

2890
02:04:11.054 --> 02:04:15.779
and now it's debts that must be paid, and

2891
02:04:18.945 --> 02:04:20.070
he's not somebody who believes

2892
02:04:20.070 --> 02:04:21.953
that you can just get off the bus when it's--

2893
02:04:21.953 --> 02:04:22.900
all right, got everything I need.

2894
02:04:22.900 --> 02:04:25.350
I'm backing out now and if he feels that

2895
02:04:25.350 --> 02:04:27.680
he owes everyone quite a bit for what they've done for him

2896
02:04:27.680 --> 02:04:30.920
and for getting him out of the forest

2897
02:04:30.920 --> 02:04:32.486
and out of his home and out into the world

2898
02:04:32.486 --> 02:04:34.650
and taking care of him from a certain standpoint.

2899
02:04:34.650 --> 02:04:36.299
BRIAN: "At the end of his talk with Yasha

2900
02:04:36.299 --> 02:04:39.230
"several episodes ago, Caleb had a very strong reaction

2901
02:04:39.230 --> 02:04:41.390
"that we've never quite seen before.

2902
02:04:41.390 --> 02:04:42.956
"Can you tell us a bit of

2903
02:04:42.956 --> 02:04:45.765
"what was going through his mind at that moment?

2904
02:04:45.765 --> 02:04:46.790
"What was it about her statement,

2905
02:04:46.790 --> 02:04:49.110
"'I don't need to tell you who,' that affected him

2906
02:04:49.110 --> 02:04:50.570
"where her initial question did not?

2907
02:04:50.570 --> 02:04:51.670
"And what was going through your mind

2908
02:04:51.670 --> 02:04:54.230
"as a player and as an actor?"

2909
02:04:54.230 --> 02:04:58.005
LIAM: Well, he's a little in love with Jester Lavorre.

2910
02:04:58.005 --> 02:05:00.070
DANI: (squealing)

2911
02:05:00.070 --> 02:05:00.903
LIAM: And has been for--

2912
02:05:00.903 --> 02:05:01.736
BRIAN: Was that you or Kyle?

2913
02:05:01.736 --> 02:05:04.477
DANI: No, that was me (laughs).
BRIAN: Okay, sometimes--

2914
02:05:04.477 --> 02:05:05.955
LIAM: Uselessly in love with her.

2915
02:05:05.955 --> 02:05:07.967
BRIAN: It's a toss-up.

2916
02:05:07.967 --> 02:05:09.467
LIAM: And has been for

2917
02:05:10.875 --> 02:05:13.441
probably, I mean, it wasn't

2918
02:05:13.441 --> 02:05:15.195
like a lightning bolt or anything,

2919
02:05:15.195 --> 02:05:18.740
but the waltz was probably, like, a little pebble

2920
02:05:18.740 --> 02:05:21.980
that started through the entire campaign making this guy

2921
02:05:21.980 --> 02:05:25.640
who was all about killing or doing the impossible

2922
02:05:25.640 --> 02:05:27.897
that, like, this is one of the things that just went--

2923
02:05:27.897 --> 02:05:28.730
(splattering)

2924
02:05:28.730 --> 02:05:32.396
And slapped any idea I had of
what was going to happen sideways

2925
02:05:32.396 --> 02:05:33.850
and it just rolled rolled and rolled.

2926
02:05:33.850 --> 02:05:37.140
And in that moment, I mean, I think some people see this,

2927
02:05:37.140 --> 02:05:41.110
like this doesn't play out verbally too much in the show.

2928
02:05:42.162 --> 02:05:43.612
It's mostly silent stuff, but

2929
02:05:46.310 --> 02:05:48.350
he just was worried that this thing that

2930
02:05:48.350 --> 02:05:51.780
he's never going to admit to because it's useless.

2931
02:05:53.200 --> 02:05:55.683
She's finding herself

2932
02:05:55.683 --> 02:05:59.375
and has her whole life ahead of her

2933
02:06:00.259 --> 02:06:02.990
and has other people around her who care for her a lot, too,

2934
02:06:02.990 --> 02:06:05.890
who are much better for her than he is.

2935
02:06:05.890 --> 02:06:07.789
DANI: Well, top table just failed their charm save

2936
02:06:07.789 --> 02:06:09.731
against Jester.

2937
02:06:10.672 --> 02:06:14.340
LIAM: And either of them would
be better options in his mind.

2938
02:06:14.340 --> 02:06:19.020
And he's aware of the way those two feel as well

2939
02:06:19.020 --> 02:06:22.420
and would never-- you know, he's--

2940
02:06:22.420 --> 02:06:24.886
it's just there in the background breaking,

2941
02:06:24.886 --> 02:06:26.540
fucking up his bullshit.

2942
02:06:26.540 --> 02:06:29.881
BRIAN: Abbigail Cordeniz wants to know--

2943
02:06:29.881 --> 02:06:31.230
DANI: (laughs)

2944
02:06:31.230 --> 02:06:33.471
LIAM: Go ahead run your show, Brian.
BRIAN: Keep going, keep going, keep going.

2945
02:06:33.471 --> 02:06:34.562
LIAM: Run your show.

2946
02:06:34.562 --> 02:06:35.890
It's all good.

2947
02:06:35.890 --> 02:06:37.848
This is the classiest one we've ever had.

2948
02:06:37.848 --> 02:06:38.756
DANI: (laughs)

2949
02:06:38.756 --> 02:06:41.122
BRIAN: That looks like so many things, doesn't it?

2950
02:06:41.122 --> 02:06:43.380
DANI: (high-pitched laughter)

2951
02:06:43.380 --> 02:06:45.447
BRIAN: And also not enough things at once.

2952
02:06:45.447 --> 02:06:48.471
LIAM: Oh, Henry's back, okay, I'll behave now.
DANI: Is a good boy.

2953
02:06:48.471 --> 02:06:53.454
(dramatic orchestra)

2954
02:06:55.570 --> 02:06:58.570
DANI: I just want to watch my Critical Role.

2955
02:06:59.725 --> 02:07:02.770
TALIESIN: For your consideration,
this is the face of a Critter

2956
02:07:02.770 --> 02:07:05.470
who's craving their Critical Role content.

2957
02:07:05.470 --> 02:07:07.345
But for this sanctimonious shipper,

2958
02:07:07.345 --> 02:07:10.430
time misled them like a trip to the Feywild.

2959
02:07:10.430 --> 02:07:13.680
They now I've come face to face with existential dread,

2960
02:07:13.680 --> 02:07:16.080
a fear of sardonic spoilers.

2961
02:07:16.960 --> 02:07:19.060
Let us lead them across the bridge into a realm

2962
02:07:19.060 --> 02:07:22.520
of bright shadows where, even if one misses the live viewing

2963
02:07:22.520 --> 02:07:24.300
of their favorite program,

2964
02:07:24.300 --> 02:07:26.170
they can still watch it on-demand

2965
02:07:26.170 --> 02:07:27.145
if they bear the mark

2966
02:07:27.145 --> 02:07:29.819
of a Twitch subscription to the channel.

2967
02:07:29.819 --> 02:07:32.453
That mark, a mysterious sigil of emoticons

2968
02:07:32.453 --> 02:07:37.440
made by the Sage, Arsequeef, in this land of shadow,

2969
02:07:37.440 --> 02:07:39.790
known as the Twitch subscription zone.

2970
02:07:39.790 --> 02:07:41.723
No shipper, fanficcer

2971
02:07:41.723 --> 02:07:43.483
or please name my kitten litter critter

2972
02:07:43.483 --> 02:07:46.340
has to feel like a bitter fritter.

2973
02:07:46.340 --> 02:07:49.400
And so ends another meandering digression,

2974
02:07:49.400 --> 02:07:52.750
a complicated parody promo down an indistinct highway

2975
02:07:52.750 --> 02:07:54.383
to the region we call...

2976
02:07:56.990 --> 02:07:59.540
the Twitch Subscription Zone.

2977
02:07:59.540 --> 02:08:01.540
TALIESIN (V.O.): Subscribe.

2978
02:08:02.573 --> 02:08:05.360
Twitch prime subscribe.

2979
02:08:05.360 --> 02:08:07.435
Gift subscribe.

2980
02:08:09.239 --> 02:08:12.214
Subscribe.

2981
02:08:12.214 --> 02:08:16.147
(dramatic trumpets)

2982
02:08:16.147 --> 02:08:20.048
You should check to see if you've left the oven on.

2983
02:08:22.415 --> 02:08:27.015
(dramatic music)

2984
02:22:09.259 --> 02:22:11.600
MATT: And welcome back.

2985
02:22:11.600 --> 02:22:16.583
[cheering]

2986
02:22:17.608 --> 02:22:22.608
All righty, so is there anything you guys wish to accomplish

2987
02:22:22.930 --> 02:22:24.805
as you leave

2988
02:22:25.730 --> 02:22:28.707
Veth Brenatto at the Chateau for a while?

2989
02:22:28.707 --> 02:22:30.040
LAURA: Oh.

2990
02:22:30.040 --> 02:22:32.440
SAM: I Just want to quickly say that

2991
02:22:32.440 --> 02:22:34.650
whoever's sitting in seat G 52

2992
02:22:34.650 --> 02:22:37.380
way up in the gallery should look under their seat

2993
02:22:37.380 --> 02:22:39.288
for a little gift.

2994
02:22:39.288 --> 02:22:40.829
[cheering]

2995
02:22:40.829 --> 02:22:41.810
That's all.

2996
02:22:41.810 --> 02:22:44.210
TRAVIS: Is it a pair of underwear or something?

2997
02:22:44.210 --> 02:22:46.687
SAM: It's Veth's used underwear.

2998
02:22:46.687 --> 02:22:49.060
[laughter]

2999
02:22:49.060 --> 02:22:51.468
MATT: Now if it was Yussa's.

3000
02:22:52.960 --> 02:22:57.960
LAURA: I'm going to just quickly tell Mama

3001
02:22:58.080 --> 02:23:00.808
what happened with the bathtub.

3002
02:23:00.808 --> 02:23:03.108
MARISHA: Yeah, and I'm going to start cleaning it up.

3003
02:23:04.280 --> 02:23:06.863
MATT: She is understanding.
ASHLEY: Is there any other way we may try to

3004
02:23:06.863 --> 02:23:08.270
Mend it or something, Jester?

3005
02:23:08.270 --> 02:23:10.170
LAURA: I will do that.

3006
02:23:10.170 --> 02:23:13.253
I'm going to Mend two pieces together

3007
02:23:15.420 --> 02:23:16.490
and give it to her.

3008
02:23:17.414 --> 02:23:20.220
[laughter]

3009
02:23:20.220 --> 02:23:22.740
MATT: (as Marion) "That is extremely kind."

3010
02:23:22.740 --> 02:23:24.808
LAURA: You're welcome.

3011
02:23:24.808 --> 02:23:28.980
It ended up being very useful, though.

3012
02:23:28.980 --> 02:23:30.205
MATT: "Okay."

3013
02:23:31.321 --> 02:23:35.338
LAURA: Did you see Nott is not Nott anymore?

3014
02:23:37.645 --> 02:23:40.490
MATT: "You are mildly confusing
me, but I'll go along with it."

3015
02:23:40.490 --> 02:23:44.440
LAURA: The goblin isn't a goblin anymore. She's a halfling.

3016
02:23:44.440 --> 02:23:45.273
MATT: "Oh!"

3017
02:23:45.273 --> 02:23:47.758
LAURA: Because of your bathtub!

3018
02:23:47.758 --> 02:23:50.758
[laughter]

3019
02:23:53.290 --> 02:23:57.599
MARISHA: It's a subgenre of kink.

3020
02:23:57.599 --> 02:24:00.210
[laughter]

3021
02:24:00.210 --> 02:24:02.990
MATT: "Then it was a worthy sacrifice."

3022
02:24:04.100 --> 02:24:05.130
LAURA: I'll replace it.

3023
02:24:05.130 --> 02:24:06.080
MATT: "Okay."

3024
02:24:06.080 --> 02:24:07.540
LAURA: How much was it?

3025
02:24:07.540 --> 02:24:09.130
MATT: "I don't know. It was a gift."

3026
02:24:09.130 --> 02:24:11.642
LAURA: I'm going to find somebody else to give you one.

3027
02:24:11.642 --> 02:24:12.740
[laughter]

3028
02:24:12.740 --> 02:24:13.907
MATT: "Fair enough."

3029
02:24:15.867 --> 02:24:17.752
So you guys have--

3030
02:24:17.752 --> 02:24:20.555
and you can include yourself in this as well,

3031
02:24:20.555 --> 02:24:22.430
you guys have an evening and another day

3032
02:24:22.430 --> 02:24:24.979
to handle any other business
you would like here in Nicodranas.

3033
02:24:24.979 --> 02:24:26.495
Is there anything else you would like to do

3034
02:24:26.495 --> 02:24:28.558
while you're here before the party?

3035
02:24:28.558 --> 02:24:31.570
LIAM: Are we going to fast track
through a little to-do list?

3036
02:24:31.570 --> 02:24:32.620
MATT: If you'd like to, yeah.

3037
02:24:34.368 --> 02:24:36.110
LIAM: The next day, I would like to ask Jester

3038
02:24:36.110 --> 02:24:40.790
if she could lead me to a shop with magical wares.

3039
02:24:40.790 --> 02:24:41.912
Do you know of any here?

3040
02:24:41.912 --> 02:24:44.202
LAURA: Of course I do. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3041
02:24:44.202 --> 02:24:45.360
I lead him to one.

3042
02:24:45.360 --> 02:24:46.557
LIAM: Okay.

3043
02:24:46.557 --> 02:24:47.790
[laughter]

3044
02:24:47.790 --> 02:24:49.390
That's better than rolling dice.

3045
02:24:51.440 --> 02:24:52.600
MATT: Ah, let's see.

3046
02:24:52.600 --> 02:24:56.560
As far as magical wares go here in Nicodranas,

3047
02:24:56.560 --> 02:24:59.280
there is, that you would know.

3048
02:24:59.280 --> 02:25:00.113
LAURA: There is

3049
02:25:01.755 --> 02:25:03.388
the--
MATT: The Meandering Treasures.

3050
02:25:03.388 --> 02:25:06.871
LAURA: The Meandering Treasures.

3051
02:25:06.871 --> 02:25:07.871
There is--

3052
02:25:09.254 --> 02:25:10.487
MATT: It's in the Restless Wharf.

3053
02:25:10.487 --> 02:25:13.745
LAURA: Oh, that's in the Restless Wharf.

3054
02:25:15.571 --> 02:25:17.840
MATT: You would know of the Seafloor's Bounty,

3055
02:25:17.840 --> 02:25:19.234
which I think you may have been to before.

3056
02:25:19.234 --> 02:25:20.862
LAURA: Mm, the Seafloor's Bounty is a good one, yeah.

3057
02:25:20.862 --> 02:25:22.647
MATT: Which is more of, like, a pawn shop, but sometimes has

3058
02:25:22.647 --> 02:25:24.540
weird, interesting things.
LAURA: It's kind of a pawn shop.

3059
02:25:24.540 --> 02:25:29.190
LIAM: I'm looking more for a spells for sale.

3060
02:25:29.190 --> 02:25:31.272
LAURA: Spells for sale, like scrolls and stuff?

3061
02:25:31.272 --> 02:25:32.105
LIAM: Yeah, scrolls, yes.

3062
02:25:32.105 --> 02:25:35.470
I need fine quality paper and ink as well.

3063
02:25:35.470 --> 02:25:36.860
LAURA: Oh, you want paper.

3064
02:25:36.860 --> 02:25:40.590
LIAM: Well, that as well, but I'm looking for something new.

3065
02:25:40.590 --> 02:25:42.500
LAURA: Ooh, what?

3066
02:25:42.500 --> 02:25:44.100
LIAM: Protection.

3067
02:25:44.100 --> 02:25:45.500
LAURA: From?

3068
02:25:45.500 --> 02:25:46.924
LIAM: Death.

3069
02:25:46.924 --> 02:25:49.900
[laughter]

3070
02:25:49.900 --> 02:25:52.550
LAURA: Okay, yeah that's important.

3071
02:25:53.831 --> 02:25:55.381
TRAVIS: You can find that in a store?

3072
02:25:56.710 --> 02:25:58.879
LIAM: In the right store, yeah.

3073
02:25:58.879 --> 02:26:01.204
ASHLEY: I mean, we all die at some point, so.

3074
02:26:03.348 --> 02:26:05.147
[laughter]

3075
02:26:05.147 --> 02:26:09.034
LIAM: Yeah, but I don't want it to be tomorrow, so--

3076
02:26:09.034 --> 02:26:09.867
ASHLEY: Ah.

3077
02:26:09.867 --> 02:26:13.492
LIAM: I'm just looking for something
to push that back a few days.

3078
02:26:15.310 --> 02:26:18.350
LAURA: Do I know of one with scrolls?

3079
02:26:18.350 --> 02:26:20.216
MATT: There isn't, like, a magic shop

3080
02:26:20.216 --> 02:26:23.580
here in Nicodranas, per se.

3081
02:26:23.580 --> 02:26:26.021
Most of what comes through here would be

3082
02:26:26.021 --> 02:26:28.330
probably traded in one of the venues that you,

3083
02:26:28.330 --> 02:26:30.310
that I mentioned earlier.

3084
02:26:30.310 --> 02:26:35.310
There isn't a heavy, magic-based establishment

3085
02:26:35.365 --> 02:26:39.250
akin to, let's say, Pumat's or anything in the city.

3086
02:26:39.250 --> 02:26:40.750
It's kind of whatever gets picked up

3087
02:26:40.750 --> 02:26:44.330
by the other eclectic odds and ends stores

3088
02:26:44.330 --> 02:26:48.038
and they're kept as some of their favorite

3089
02:26:48.038 --> 02:26:50.820
special items to sell to passers through.

3090
02:26:50.820 --> 02:26:53.830
LAURA: Well, we can try the pawn shop.

3091
02:26:53.830 --> 02:26:55.338
I mean, we can ask Yussa,

3092
02:26:55.338 --> 02:26:58.005
maybe he has a spell he would sell you.

3093
02:27:00.410 --> 02:27:02.477
LIAM: Yeah, we could do that, that's a good idea.

3094
02:27:02.477 --> 02:27:06.550
You think that's more likely than the shops here in town?

3095
02:27:06.550 --> 02:27:09.128
LAURA: Well, it's hard to find something specific

3096
02:27:09.128 --> 02:27:12.828
at a pawn shop. You just have to deal with what they have.

3097
02:27:15.010 --> 02:27:16.510
LIAM: All right.

3098
02:27:16.510 --> 02:27:17.960
LAURA: Should we go see Yussa?

3099
02:27:17.960 --> 02:27:21.870
LIAM: Let's talk to Yussa and maybe he can help me,

3100
02:27:21.870 --> 02:27:24.000
and if not, perhaps he can point us somewhere

3101
02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:25.850
and maybe it's a lost cause.

3102
02:27:25.850 --> 02:27:28.533
Let's give it a shot. A lot to get done.

3103
02:27:29.470 --> 02:27:30.620
We'll swing by.

3104
02:27:30.620 --> 02:27:33.330
MATT: Okay, anybody else going with
them to the Tidepeak Tower,

3105
02:27:33.330 --> 02:27:34.913
or just the two of them?

3106
02:27:34.913 --> 02:27:37.920
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, I'll go, yes, of course.

3107
02:27:37.920 --> 02:27:38.753
MATT: All righty.

3108
02:27:38.753 --> 02:27:41.205
LIAM: There's that fish place you like
right across from the tower.

3109
02:27:41.205 --> 02:27:42.331
MATT: That's true.

3110
02:27:42.331 --> 02:27:47.131
[laughter]

3111
02:27:47.131 --> 02:27:49.440
MARISHA: (laughs)

3112
02:27:49.440 --> 02:27:52.560
MATT: All right. You make your way to Tidepeak,

3113
02:27:52.560 --> 02:27:55.970
after going through Wensforth the fourth once more.

3114
02:27:55.970 --> 02:27:59.080
Eventually Yussa greets you down in the familiar

3115
02:27:59.080 --> 02:28:01.650
gathering chamber at the base of the tower.

3116
02:28:01.650 --> 02:28:06.150
As he descends in his elegant, and somewhat aloof way,

3117
02:28:07.350 --> 02:28:09.170
he looks towards you, Caleb.

3118
02:28:09.170 --> 02:28:13.510
"So it would seem that you have come requesting

3119
02:28:13.510 --> 02:28:14.930
"something from me, yes?"

3120
02:28:14.930 --> 02:28:18.290
LIAM: It seems like a bit of a stretch.

3121
02:28:18.290 --> 02:28:19.870
I was hoping to find somewhere

3122
02:28:19.870 --> 02:28:21.630
in town to do a bit of shopping,

3123
02:28:21.630 --> 02:28:25.613
but I'm used to Rexxentrum, which is very thick with,

3124
02:28:25.613 --> 02:28:27.606
you know.
LAURA: Magic.

3125
02:28:27.606 --> 02:28:31.738
LIAM: Rare magic, but I, you know, in all my noodling about,

3126
02:28:31.738 --> 02:28:36.138
I have heard of a way of shielding yourself specifically

3127
02:28:36.138 --> 02:28:41.138
from fairly powerful magic, creating a bit of a,

3128
02:28:41.240 --> 02:28:43.857
not really a shield, but like,

3129
02:28:43.857 --> 02:28:48.085
a sphere of protection, a globe if you will.

3130
02:28:49.320 --> 02:28:50.910
I don't know if that rings any bells for you,

3131
02:28:50.910 --> 02:28:55.480
but I do have coin or I could trade in favor.

3132
02:28:55.480 --> 02:28:57.438
I do have a few things.

3133
02:28:57.438 --> 02:29:02.188
And maybe it is presumptuous of me to ask, but here I am.

3134
02:29:03.190 --> 02:29:06.683
MATT: I am looking at the specific spell in question here.

3135
02:29:08.720 --> 02:29:10.833
TRAVIS: Is that a Globe of No Death?

3136
02:29:10.833 --> 02:29:12.716
MATT: What spell-- Which spell specifically?

3137
02:29:12.716 --> 02:29:15.841
LIAM: Globe of Invulnerability is what I'm looking for.

3138
02:29:15.841 --> 02:29:16.983
MATT: Gotcha.

3139
02:29:20.080 --> 02:29:23.047
LAURA: Do you want be, like, a superhuman?

3140
02:29:23.047 --> 02:29:25.430
Like really...

3141
02:29:25.430 --> 02:29:27.013
LIAM: No, I'm very human.

3142
02:29:27.013 --> 02:29:31.340
I'm your basic garden variety human,

3143
02:29:31.340 --> 02:29:34.150
but humans like to kill each other

3144
02:29:34.150 --> 02:29:35.290
and the ones we are dealing with

3145
02:29:35.290 --> 02:29:36.910
are very powerful magically,

3146
02:29:36.910 --> 02:29:40.818
so I'm looking for specific protection against that.

3147
02:29:40.818 --> 02:29:43.310
Against my old friends.

3148
02:29:43.310 --> 02:29:44.143
LAURA: Right.

3149
02:29:44.143 --> 02:29:45.830
MATT: "It would indeed be difficult to locate

3150
02:29:45.830 --> 02:29:49.460
"this sort of magic in the streets of the city.

3151
02:29:49.460 --> 02:29:52.850
"Most trade passes through to other destinations."

3152
02:29:52.850 --> 02:29:55.980
LAURA: (drawn out) But?

3153
02:29:55.980 --> 02:29:58.546
MATT: "I do--"
LIAM: Such as you.

3154
02:29:58.546 --> 02:30:02.290
MATT: "-- have such a spell,

3155
02:30:02.290 --> 02:30:07.285
"but powerful magics are guarded intentionally.

3156
02:30:10.160 --> 02:30:11.543
"I will trade you.

3157
02:30:13.280 --> 02:30:16.600
"I will allow you to copy the spell.

3158
02:30:16.600 --> 02:30:19.043
"I will supply the materials,

3159
02:30:21.500 --> 02:30:24.003
"but I keep the golem.

3160
02:30:27.890 --> 02:30:30.240
"It has been extremely useful to me in this time

3161
02:30:30.240 --> 02:30:35.240
"since you left last and Wensforth is limited

3162
02:30:35.370 --> 02:30:38.710
"by being just one individual.

3163
02:30:38.710 --> 02:30:40.543
"Having two, especially one

3164
02:30:40.543 --> 02:30:45.543
"that does not occasionally talk back, would be wonderful."

3165
02:30:46.008 --> 02:30:48.370
LIAM: You have yourself a deal.

3166
02:30:50.290 --> 02:30:51.707
MATT: "Then follow me."

3167
02:30:51.707 --> 02:30:53.210
LIAM: Okay.

3168
02:30:53.210 --> 02:30:56.300
MATT: Yussa leads you up into the familiar

3169
02:30:56.300 --> 02:30:59.810
research chamber where you had previously had a discussion

3170
02:30:59.810 --> 02:31:02.768
and presents to you the spell and the parchment and such

3171
02:31:02.768 --> 02:31:06.200
to copy the spell, but does require you to inscribe

3172
02:31:06.200 --> 02:31:10.033
your crafted golem from the Halls of Halas

3173
02:31:10.033 --> 02:31:12.650
onto him as the master as opposed to yourself.

3174
02:31:12.650 --> 02:31:15.150
LIAM: Yeah, is that time consuming?

3175
02:31:16.460 --> 02:31:17.620
MATT: Copying the spell will take a little bit.

3176
02:31:17.620 --> 02:31:21.465
LIAM: That will take the day, I think,
but handing over Willi?

3177
02:31:21.465 --> 02:31:23.265
MATT: I'd say it'll take about an h--,

3178
02:31:23.265 --> 02:31:24.098
I'm saying, spitballing here,

3179
02:31:24.098 --> 02:31:25.714
an hour or so to complete the process

3180
02:31:25.714 --> 02:31:27.260
of transitioning that ownership.

3181
02:31:27.260 --> 02:31:29.460
LIAM: Okay, and the party's tonight?

3182
02:31:29.460 --> 02:31:30.800
LAURA: No, the party is tomorrow.

3183
02:31:30.800 --> 02:31:31.641
LIAM: Tomorrow then, correct?
MATT: Tomorrow.

3184
02:31:31.641 --> 02:31:32.474
LIAM: Yeah.

3185
02:31:34.570 --> 02:31:36.660
Excellent suggestion.

3186
02:31:36.660 --> 02:31:38.290
I think I'm going to be here for the day

3187
02:31:38.290 --> 02:31:39.850
and I don't want to stop you.

3188
02:31:39.850 --> 02:31:41.092
You know, you maybe you want to

3189
02:31:41.092 --> 02:31:43.139
spend more time with your mother or...

3190
02:31:43.139 --> 02:31:45.730
LAURA: Yeah, totally.

3191
02:31:45.730 --> 02:31:50.248
Fjord, do you want to go to the fish market or?

3192
02:31:50.248 --> 02:31:52.280
[laughter]

3193
02:31:52.280 --> 02:31:54.700
TRAVIS: I mean, are you hungry?

3194
02:31:54.700 --> 02:31:56.400
LAURA: I don't know, maybe.

3195
02:31:56.400 --> 02:31:59.022
TALIESIN: Are we going to need
something to wear for tomorrow?

3196
02:31:59.022 --> 02:32:03.171
LAURA: (gasps) We need dresses! Oh my god, Caduceus!

3197
02:32:03.171 --> 02:32:05.150
[laughter]

3198
02:32:05.150 --> 02:32:08.621
TALIESIN: I need a new hat.
I don't know about anything beyond that.

3199
02:32:08.621 --> 02:32:11.229
LAURA: Caleb, you're occupied.

3200
02:32:11.229 --> 02:32:14.063
I will get you something very nice to wear, don't worry.

3201
02:32:14.063 --> 02:32:16.913
LIAM: I give her

3202
02:32:16.913 --> 02:32:18.563
five platinum.

3203
02:32:18.563 --> 02:32:19.621
SAM: Whoa.

3204
02:32:20.922 --> 02:32:24.255
LIAM: Why don't you choose something for me?

3205
02:32:25.135 --> 02:32:27.093
MARISHA: Going to the Met Gala, what?

3206
02:32:27.093 --> 02:32:32.060
LIAM: Tasteful, dignified, because we are
hobnobbing with some elite people.

3207
02:32:32.060 --> 02:32:34.334
LAURA: Yes.
LIAM: So not flashy,

3208
02:32:34.334 --> 02:32:36.384
but, you know, understated,

3209
02:32:36.384 --> 02:32:39.417
but you know what to do.

3210
02:32:39.417 --> 02:32:42.717
LAURA: I fully know

3211
02:32:42.717 --> 02:32:45.650
[laughter]

3212
02:32:45.650 --> 02:32:48.041
exactly what you're talking about.

3213
02:32:49.310 --> 02:32:50.660
LIAM: Okay.

3214
02:32:51.963 --> 02:32:54.090
[laughter]

3215
02:32:54.090 --> 02:32:54.923
Okay.

3216
02:32:56.940 --> 02:32:58.773
Fjord, enjoy the fish.

3217
02:32:59.698 --> 02:33:02.698
[laughter]

3218
02:33:04.510 --> 02:33:06.093
TRAVIS: One time, I went there one time.

3219
02:33:06.093 --> 02:33:07.952
[laughter]

3220
02:33:07.952 --> 02:33:10.340
LIAM: Yeah, man. I had two cloaks, get used to it.

3221
02:33:10.340 --> 02:33:11.298
That shit happens.

3222
02:33:11.298 --> 02:33:13.548
(laughter)

3223
02:33:16.660 --> 02:33:17.660
MATT: All right.

3224
02:33:19.001 --> 02:33:21.850
TALIESIN: Go to one fish market, yeah.

3225
02:33:21.850 --> 02:33:23.460
MATT: So you guys can go ahead and, if you're looking

3226
02:33:23.460 --> 02:33:24.293
to spend the rest of the evening

3227
02:33:24.293 --> 02:33:26.043
finding clothing for yourselves

3228
02:33:26.043 --> 02:33:27.500
and perhaps the rest of your compatriots

3229
02:33:27.500 --> 02:33:30.208
for tomorrow night's party event,

3230
02:33:30.208 --> 02:33:32.550
you're welcome to do so.

3231
02:33:32.550 --> 02:33:36.883
TRAVIS: I actually don't, I don't think I need it.

3232
02:33:36.883 --> 02:33:39.690
I'll just make something else appear while I'm there.

3233
02:33:39.690 --> 02:33:42.250
ASHLEY: I feel like I'm dressed okay.

3234
02:33:42.250 --> 02:33:46.100
LAURA: But won't people know that it's an illusion?

3235
02:33:46.100 --> 02:33:47.200
There's a lot of magic people.

3236
02:33:47.200 --> 02:33:50.210
Don't you want to, like, have actual clothes?

3237
02:33:50.210 --> 02:33:54.670
TRAVIS: No, why would I care if they know it's an illusion?

3238
02:33:54.670 --> 02:33:56.730
LAURA: Well, if it's fancy clothes for real,

3239
02:33:56.730 --> 02:33:59.563
you can have fancy clothes for real.

3240
02:33:59.563 --> 02:34:00.690
[laughter]

3241
02:34:00.690 --> 02:34:04.310
TALIESIN: And then if it gets
dispelled, you just look terrible.

3242
02:34:04.310 --> 02:34:07.150
LAURA: Well, you don't look terrible Fjord you just look...

3243
02:34:07.150 --> 02:34:09.608
TRAVIS: Caduceus, do you think I look terrible?

3244
02:34:09.608 --> 02:34:12.150
[laughter]

3245
02:34:12.150 --> 02:34:14.277
TALIESIN: No, I mean, I think you look great,

3246
02:34:14.277 --> 02:34:18.685
but, you know, there's something to be said about

3247
02:34:18.685 --> 02:34:20.443
when in Vasselheim, you know,

3248
02:34:20.443 --> 02:34:23.743
you got to dress for where you are.

3249
02:34:23.743 --> 02:34:26.000
(laughter)

3250
02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:28.308
That's what they say, right?

3251
02:34:30.007 --> 02:34:32.727
That's what I wanted right there, thank you.

3252
02:34:32.727 --> 02:34:34.848
MATT: They do now.

3253
02:34:34.848 --> 02:34:36.530
TALIESIN: Canon.
LIAM: Canon.

3254
02:34:36.530 --> 02:34:40.960
TRAVIS: Sure, all right, I certainly
don't want to look <i>terrible.</i>

3255
02:34:40.960 --> 02:34:43.550
TALIESIN: We want to look like we want to talk to people.

3256
02:34:43.550 --> 02:34:45.810
We want people to talk to us, to approach us.

3257
02:34:45.810 --> 02:34:47.400
You want to be approachable.

3258
02:34:47.400 --> 02:34:51.185
LAURA: (gasping) You could get a really, really nice,

3259
02:34:51.185 --> 02:34:52.840
pirate-y looking captain's--

3260
02:34:52.840 --> 02:34:53.673
TRAVIS: No, I don't think so.

3261
02:34:53.673 --> 02:34:55.156
LAURA: But, like, a captain's coat.

3262
02:34:55.156 --> 02:34:56.476
TRAVIS: No, you know, I'll--

3263
02:34:56.476 --> 02:34:59.659
MARISHA: Big feather, like, real big feather.

3264
02:34:59.659 --> 02:35:00.659
TALIESIN: I'll get you something

3265
02:35:00.659 --> 02:35:03.300
calm and dignified.
ASHLEY: They do say the bigger the feather--

3266
02:35:03.300 --> 02:35:05.350
MARISHA: The closer to Uk'otoa.

3267
02:35:05.350 --> 02:35:08.350
[laughter]
LAURA and SAM: (whispering) Uk'otoa.

3268
02:35:09.695 --> 02:35:12.770
MARISHA: Makes no sense, really, when you think about it.

3269
02:35:12.770 --> 02:35:15.620
TRAVIS: Right, so I would want no feather.

3270
02:35:15.620 --> 02:35:18.170
MARISHA: I don't know.

3271
02:35:18.170 --> 02:35:20.878
I didn't make up the saying.

3272
02:35:20.878 --> 02:35:25.753
(laughter)

3273
02:35:30.380 --> 02:35:34.450
TRAVIS: Jester, since you're already
so gung-ho about shopping.

3274
02:35:34.450 --> 02:35:35.443
LAURA: Yeah.

3275
02:35:35.443 --> 02:35:37.551
TRAVIS: Why don't you just...

3276
02:35:37.551 --> 02:35:39.151
pick something up for me as well.

3277
02:35:39.151 --> 02:35:41.775
TALIESIN: I'll try and keep her reeled in.

3278
02:35:41.775 --> 02:35:42.608
MARISHA: Okay.

3279
02:35:42.608 --> 02:35:44.966
[laughter]

3280
02:35:44.966 --> 02:35:47.416
LAURA: You got it, Fjord!

3281
02:35:48.794 --> 02:35:53.794
MARISHA: I don't know what to wear to look approachable, so

3282
02:35:54.287 --> 02:35:55.530
please dress me too.

3283
02:35:55.530 --> 02:35:56.363
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

3284
02:35:56.363 --> 02:36:01.363
[cheering]

3285
02:36:01.840 --> 02:36:06.560
ASHLEY: Why are you looking at me?!
I look very approachable.

3286
02:36:06.560 --> 02:36:10.780
TALIESIN: You look like you're approached,
like, all the time.

3287
02:36:12.440 --> 02:36:13.273
One night.

3288
02:36:14.170 --> 02:36:17.280
ASHLEY: Okay, pick me out something; I don't like shopping.

3289
02:36:17.280 --> 02:36:18.113
You do it.

3290
02:36:18.113 --> 02:36:19.580
LAURA: This is going to be so much fun.

3291
02:36:19.580 --> 02:36:21.430
TALIESIN: I'm so excited for this.

3292
02:36:22.590 --> 02:36:24.840
LAURA: We'll get something for Veth, too, since

3293
02:36:24.840 --> 02:36:25.845
she's occupied.

3294
02:36:25.845 --> 02:36:27.490
TALIESIN: Yeah, very.

3295
02:36:28.510 --> 02:36:31.358
ASHLEY: Wait, we're not going to get to the fish market?

3296
02:36:31.358 --> 02:36:36.225
(laughter)
[laughter]

3297
02:36:41.440 --> 02:36:46.157
MATT: Stop! Stop!

3298
02:36:48.773 --> 02:36:50.354
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

3299
02:36:50.354 --> 02:36:53.404
LIAM: (Irish accent) He's always after me Lucky Charms.

3300
02:36:53.404 --> 02:36:55.445
(laughter)

3301
02:36:57.622 --> 02:36:58.455
LAURA: Oh my god.

3302
02:37:01.860 --> 02:37:03.687
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

3303
02:37:03.687 --> 02:37:06.662
LIAM: (laughs)

3304
02:37:08.737 --> 02:37:11.696
Asphyxiation, [inaudible] 3,000.

3305
02:37:12.590 --> 02:37:13.870
MATT: All righty, so,

3306
02:37:16.440 --> 02:37:18.840
spending the remainder of the evening

3307
02:37:18.840 --> 02:37:22.280
gathering outfits for the rest of your party.

3308
02:37:22.280 --> 02:37:23.113
LAURA: Yes.

3309
02:37:24.140 --> 02:37:26.289
MATT: How much are you willing to spend total?

3310
02:37:26.289 --> 02:37:28.753
TALIESIN and LAURA: It's only money.

3311
02:37:28.753 --> 02:37:29.980
TALIESIN: We'll kill things and make more.

3312
02:37:29.980 --> 02:37:32.545
LAURA: Well, we've got the five platinum from Caleb.

3313
02:37:32.545 --> 02:37:33.820
MATT: Yes.

3314
02:37:33.820 --> 02:37:36.153
LAURA: If I put another...

3315
02:37:37.836 --> 02:37:39.504
10 platinum in.

3316
02:37:39.504 --> 02:37:40.337
SAM: Jesus.

3317
02:37:41.720 --> 02:37:44.294
MATT: Could buy some nice outfits.

3318
02:37:44.294 --> 02:37:45.802
LAURA: Only if it's necessary, you know,

3319
02:37:45.802 --> 02:37:48.789
I'm not going to throw it away.

3320
02:37:48.789 --> 02:37:51.097
MATT: Depends, it's up to you, like I said.

3321
02:37:51.097 --> 02:37:52.551
SAM: Do it, do it, do it.
LAURA: Do it!

3322
02:37:52.551 --> 02:37:53.404
MATT: All right.

3323
02:37:53.404 --> 02:37:54.597
[cheering]

3324
02:37:54.597 --> 02:37:55.957
TALIESIN: I'll put some in if you need, too.

3325
02:37:55.957 --> 02:37:56.936
LAURA: Okay.

3326
02:37:56.936 --> 02:37:59.169
MATT: All right.

3327
02:37:59.169 --> 02:38:01.480
Are you purchasing them all at an even price

3328
02:38:01.480 --> 02:38:02.770
or are you putting more into Caleb's

3329
02:38:02.770 --> 02:38:04.923
because he put more money in?

3330
02:38:04.923 --> 02:38:09.208
LIAM: Get ready to be trapped in
the character creation menu for hours.

3331
02:38:09.208 --> 02:38:10.758
MATT: (laughter) Yeah.

3332
02:38:10.758 --> 02:38:12.080
TALIESIN: How much are you putting in?

3333
02:38:12.080 --> 02:38:12.913
LAURA: I'm putting 10.

3334
02:38:12.913 --> 02:38:14.667
TALIESIN: I'll just put another 10 and then we got it going.

3335
02:38:14.667 --> 02:38:16.134
LAURA: Oh my god.

3336
02:38:19.186 --> 02:38:24.078
MARISHA: You buy me a Lady Gaga meat dress
or do not come home.

3337
02:38:24.078 --> 02:38:27.070
[laughter]

3338
02:38:28.053 --> 02:38:29.044
LAURA: Oh my god.

3339
02:38:29.044 --> 02:38:30.444
MATT: So what's the platinum total on this, then?

3340
02:38:30.444 --> 02:38:33.870
LAURA: That would be 25 platinum.

3341
02:38:33.870 --> 02:38:36.362
MATT: Okay, that's 250 gold.

3342
02:38:38.653 --> 02:38:40.870
All righty. You can buy some nice outfits,

3343
02:38:40.870 --> 02:38:43.911
up to pretty much whatever your imagination can muster.

3344
02:38:43.911 --> 02:38:45.269
LAURA: Fabulous.

3345
02:38:45.269 --> 02:38:47.460
TALIESIN: We'll be back.
LAURA: And because

3346
02:38:47.460 --> 02:38:49.693
we're giving so much money, we can get a super speedy.

3347
02:38:50.580 --> 02:38:52.280
MATT: It'll be ready by tomorrow.

3348
02:38:52.280 --> 02:38:54.860
LAURA: That's enough time, that's great.

3349
02:38:54.860 --> 02:38:57.110
MATT: As it is largely already completed

3350
02:38:57.110 --> 02:38:58.840
outfits that you are now choosing

3351
02:38:58.840 --> 02:39:01.203
and then having them tailored overnight to the specific

3352
02:39:01.203 --> 02:39:03.360
requirements and measurements

3353
02:39:03.360 --> 02:39:05.418
to those of which you think you can recall.

3354
02:39:05.418 --> 02:39:06.298
LAURA: Okay.

3355
02:39:06.298 --> 02:39:10.317
[uneasy noises]

3356
02:39:10.317 --> 02:39:12.317
ASHLEY: Oh, brother.

3357
02:39:13.808 --> 02:39:15.610
MATT: Caleb, you spend the rest of your evening researching

3358
02:39:15.610 --> 02:39:17.870
and taking down the spell.

3359
02:39:17.870 --> 02:39:19.370
Is there anything else anybody else wants to accomplish

3360
02:39:19.370 --> 02:39:20.203
before the evening's done,

3361
02:39:20.203 --> 02:39:21.794
or do you want to move on to the next day?

3362
02:39:21.794 --> 02:39:25.240
The day of the party.
MARISHA: Yasha, Fjord.

3363
02:39:25.240 --> 02:39:26.448
Fish market?

3364
02:39:26.448 --> 02:39:29.190
[laughter]

3365
02:39:29.190 --> 02:39:31.523
ASHLEY: It is my favored terrain.

3366
02:39:31.523 --> 02:39:35.873
[laughter and cheering]

3367
02:39:35.873 --> 02:39:40.692
[laughter and cheering]

3368
02:39:40.692 --> 02:39:45.060
[laughter and cheering]

3369
02:39:45.060 --> 02:39:48.082
TRAVIS: Maybe I should just excuse myself.

3370
02:39:48.082 --> 02:39:50.166
ASHLEY: No, no, no, let's go.

3371
02:39:50.166 --> 02:39:52.482
I love, let's go.

3372
02:39:52.482 --> 02:39:54.990
MARISHA: Yeah, girl. Yeah.

3373
02:39:54.990 --> 02:39:56.498
TRAVIS: We go to the fish market.

3374
02:39:56.498 --> 02:39:58.631
MARISHA: (drawn out) Mm-hmm.

3375
02:39:58.631 --> 02:40:00.266
MATT: You do. You get some nice fish.

3376
02:40:02.590 --> 02:40:04.756
It's very good here in Nicodranas. It's a coastal city.

3377
02:40:04.756 --> 02:40:06.210
They pride themselves, the fishermen here

3378
02:40:06.210 --> 02:40:10.318
do a fine job it is fresh, it is well prepared.

3379
02:40:10.318 --> 02:40:12.099
MARISHA: Great lobster taco.

3380
02:40:12.099 --> 02:40:14.330
[screaming]

3381
02:40:14.330 --> 02:40:15.681
ASHLEY: I like shellfish a lot.

3382
02:40:15.681 --> 02:40:17.281
MARISHA and ASHLEY: Yeah.

3383
02:40:17.281 --> 02:40:19.898
ASHLEY: When it's really, like, hard to crack.

3384
02:40:21.490 --> 02:40:23.406
I'm talking about shellfish.

3385
02:40:23.406 --> 02:40:24.239
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

3386
02:40:24.239 --> 02:40:29.164
[laughter]

3387
02:40:30.657 --> 02:40:34.820
MARISHA: Fjord, you have a favorite fish dish?

3388
02:40:34.820 --> 02:40:36.853
TRAVIS: Am I here?

3389
02:40:36.853 --> 02:40:39.103
(laughter)

3390
02:40:39.940 --> 02:40:42.252
I just checked the fuck out, like--

3391
02:40:42.252 --> 02:40:44.618
LIAM: (cackles)

3392
02:40:44.618 --> 02:40:46.800
TRAVIS: Deep stare, <i>deep</i> stare.

3393
02:40:48.170 --> 02:40:49.670
MARISHA: Will you pass me the butter?

3394
02:40:51.140 --> 02:40:51.973
Thank you.

3395
02:40:52.848 --> 02:40:56.006
LIAM: (laughs)

3396
02:40:58.860 --> 02:40:59.693
TRAVIS: Well,

3397
02:41:02.210 --> 02:41:04.168
Best turn in.

3398
02:41:04.168 --> 02:41:06.418
(laughter)

3399
02:41:07.500 --> 02:41:08.750
ASHLEY: Yeah, I guess it's time.

3400
02:41:08.750 --> 02:41:12.132
I really wonder what they're going to
come back with for our clothes.

3401
02:41:12.132 --> 02:41:16.174
Hopefully it's nothing colorful for me.

3402
02:41:17.440 --> 02:41:20.460
MARISHA: I wouldn't put that out into the universe.

3403
02:41:20.460 --> 02:41:21.293
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3404
02:41:22.720 --> 02:41:25.120
TRAVIS: You don't like bright colors?

3405
02:41:25.120 --> 02:41:27.250
ASHLEY: Well, I just like to just wear

3406
02:41:27.250 --> 02:41:29.900
simple, I don't know nothing flashy.

3407
02:41:29.900 --> 02:41:33.130
MARISHA: You like flowers, so you like color.

3408
02:41:33.130 --> 02:41:34.895
ASHLEY: That's, like, a--

3409
02:41:34.895 --> 02:41:36.562
those are beautiful.

3410
02:41:38.760 --> 02:41:40.780
MARISHA: I mean, you are, too.

3411
02:41:40.780 --> 02:41:42.014
TRAVIS: Oh, Jesus.

3412
02:41:42.014 --> 02:41:46.436
[cheering]

3413
02:41:46.436 --> 02:41:49.800
[cheering]

3414
02:41:49.800 --> 02:41:51.710
You're gorgeous too, Fjord.

3415
02:41:51.710 --> 02:41:53.335
ASHLEY: Yeah, Fjord, you're great.

3416
02:41:53.335 --> 02:41:55.610
You're both very beautiful.

3417
02:41:55.610 --> 02:41:58.170
You're both very beautiful, very gorgeous.

3418
02:41:58.170 --> 02:42:00.221
Beau, you're so beautiful.

3419
02:42:00.221 --> 02:42:01.804
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

3420
02:42:03.451 --> 02:42:05.876
TRAVIS: Did they put alcohol <i>in</i> your fish?

3421
02:42:05.876 --> 02:42:08.876
[laughter]

3422
02:42:14.590 --> 02:42:16.073
Shall we head back now?

3423
02:42:16.073 --> 02:42:18.147
MARISHA: Yeah, okay.
ASHLEY: Yeah, we can head back.

3424
02:42:18.147 --> 02:42:19.891
MARISHA: Yeah, it's late.

3425
02:42:19.891 --> 02:42:23.463
MATT: After a raucous night at the fish market,

3426
02:42:24.910 --> 02:42:28.243
you return to find your rooms prepared

3427
02:42:28.243 --> 02:42:30.076
at the Lavish Chateau.

3428
02:42:31.340 --> 02:42:34.033
LIAM: Is <i>this</i> the year we reclaim our dignity?

3429
02:42:36.417 --> 02:42:37.250
MARISHA: Never.

3430
02:42:37.250 --> 02:42:40.766
MATT: There's never going to be a year.

3431
02:42:40.766 --> 02:42:41.993
TRAVIS: Further away.

3432
02:42:41.993 --> 02:42:43.870
MATT: So as you all gather for the night,

3433
02:42:43.870 --> 02:42:48.640
your orders are in. The clothing of your preferred request

3434
02:42:48.640 --> 02:42:52.180
and acquisitions will be ready tomorrow midday,

3435
02:42:52.180 --> 02:42:54.013
in time for the party.

3436
02:42:55.960 --> 02:42:58.361
SAM: Let's go to the party.
MATT: All right.

3437
02:42:58.361 --> 02:43:00.477
TRAVIS: It's tomorrow.
SAM: Yeah, fast forward to that.

3438
02:43:00.477 --> 02:43:01.693
TRAVIS: Oh, okay.
MATT: All right.

3439
02:43:01.693 --> 02:43:02.817
[laughter]

3440
02:43:02.817 --> 02:43:04.310
You rest for the evening,

3441
02:43:04.310 --> 02:43:05.998
comfortably for the first time in a while.

3442
02:43:05.998 --> 02:43:07.532
Not out in the open.

3443
02:43:07.532 --> 02:43:08.973
Jesus Christ, Sam.

3444
02:43:08.973 --> 02:43:11.798
[laughter]

3445
02:43:14.963 --> 02:43:17.438
Oh my god!

3446
02:43:17.438 --> 02:43:20.538
TRAVIS: (laughs)

3447
02:43:21.506 --> 02:43:22.339
MARISHA: Wow.

3448
02:43:24.722 --> 02:43:26.555
MATT: I regret everything.

3449
02:43:30.030 --> 02:43:31.455
Okay.

3450
02:43:33.236 --> 02:43:35.020
LIAM: Get it, Dr. Zaius.

3451
02:43:35.020 --> 02:43:37.270
(laughter)

3452
02:43:38.228 --> 02:43:40.395
SAM: It's the forbidden zone.

3453
02:43:42.098 --> 02:43:43.248
MATT: The next day, it looks like

3454
02:43:43.248 --> 02:43:47.173
more and more of the armada in the harbor

3455
02:43:47.173 --> 02:43:49.220
is getting prepared.

3456
02:43:49.220 --> 02:43:52.950
The days are growing quickly to the exit from Nicodranas

3457
02:43:52.950 --> 02:43:55.840
to the east to meet towards the negotiation.

3458
02:43:55.840 --> 02:43:59.730
After you have a fine morning meal and the day is yours,

3459
02:43:59.730 --> 02:44:03.063
Jester and Caduceus return with outfits

3460
02:44:03.063 --> 02:44:05.062
prepared for the night's event.

3461
02:44:05.062 --> 02:44:06.365
If you'd like to let them know

3462
02:44:06.365 --> 02:44:07.820
and show off what you purchased.

3463
02:44:07.820 --> 02:44:10.520
LAURA: Yes, we pull out for Caleb

3464
02:44:10.520 --> 02:44:15.190
a long, black, fitted coat that goes almost to the floor.

3465
02:44:15.190 --> 02:44:18.810
A la Snape, like, think that kind of a look,

3466
02:44:18.810 --> 02:44:21.043
with silver embroidery on it,

3467
02:44:21.043 --> 02:44:24.209
but it's lined with a red and gold damask,

3468
02:44:24.209 --> 02:44:25.867
like silky lining.

3469
02:44:25.867 --> 02:44:28.617
ASHLEY: Ooh.

3470
02:44:29.750 --> 02:44:31.500
LIAM: You have done well.

3471
02:44:32.766 --> 02:44:34.910
I will fit in.

3472
02:44:34.910 --> 02:44:37.380
LAURA: You'll look really nice, Caleb.

3473
02:44:37.380 --> 02:44:38.992
LIAM: Thank you, both of you.

3474
02:44:38.992 --> 02:44:40.358
LAURA: For Beau,

3475
02:44:40.358 --> 02:44:43.016
we got her a very well tailored,

3476
02:44:43.016 --> 02:44:44.591
fitted men's suit.

3477
02:44:44.591 --> 02:44:45.467
MARISHA: (excited noise)

3478
02:44:45.467 --> 02:44:50.290
[cheering]

3479
02:44:50.290 --> 02:44:51.398
I'm listening.

3480
02:44:51.398 --> 02:44:55.920
LAURA: Like, in slate gray

3481
02:44:55.920 --> 02:44:59.062
and a cobalt blue ascot.

3482
02:45:00.520 --> 02:45:01.915
TRAVIS: It's yo shit.

3483
02:45:01.915 --> 02:45:05.030
MARISHA: I just give them both a big hug.

3484
02:45:05.030 --> 02:45:07.138
LAURA: Oh and fitted boots, like,

3485
02:45:07.138 --> 02:45:09.354
that go up to the knee, what do you think?

3486
02:45:09.354 --> 02:45:12.271
Yeah, it's going to look fucking sick.

3487
02:45:13.530 --> 02:45:14.798
For Fjord--

3488
02:45:14.798 --> 02:45:16.380
MATT: I'm going to buy her this
for Christmas now, you realize.

3489
02:45:16.380 --> 02:45:17.388
MARISHA: I'm so happy.

3490
02:45:17.388 --> 02:45:19.746
(laughter)

3491
02:45:19.746 --> 02:45:21.188
TRAVIS: Physical reaction happening over here.

3492
02:45:21.188 --> 02:45:23.038
MARISHA: I'm so happy.

3493
02:45:24.249 --> 02:45:25.974
LAURA: For Fjord.
TRAVIS: Yes.

3494
02:45:25.974 --> 02:45:28.215
LAURA: We got you, well number one, some fitted pants

3495
02:45:28.215 --> 02:45:30.787
to look very nice on your butt.

3496
02:45:30.787 --> 02:45:33.300
(laughter)

3497
02:45:33.300 --> 02:45:38.300
And hen we got to a navy suit coat.

3498
02:45:38.550 --> 02:45:40.758
Very captain-esque, right?

3499
02:45:40.758 --> 02:45:43.080
With leather trim on it.

3500
02:45:43.080 --> 02:45:47.860
Double-breasted square shoulders to show off your frame.

3501
02:45:47.860 --> 02:45:49.115
TALIESIN: Very nice boots.

3502
02:45:49.115 --> 02:45:52.480
LAURA: Very nice shiny black boots, super, super shiny.

3503
02:45:52.480 --> 02:45:53.313
TRAVIS: Thank you.

3504
02:45:53.313 --> 02:45:55.813
TALIESIN: Biggest pirate hat they could make.

3505
02:45:55.813 --> 02:45:58.508
(laughter)

3506
02:45:58.508 --> 02:46:03.474
[cheering]

3507
02:46:05.066 --> 02:46:07.899
MATT: This hat puts Avantika to shame.

3508
02:46:11.320 --> 02:46:12.503
LAURA: You don't have to wear it, Fjord,

3509
02:46:12.503 --> 02:46:13.640
it was more just for fun.

3510
02:46:13.640 --> 02:46:16.348
TRAVIS: I wear it with fucking pride.

3511
02:46:16.348 --> 02:46:21.140
[cheering]

3512
02:46:22.720 --> 02:46:25.210
LIAM: Do us a favor and walk through that doorway.

3513
02:46:25.210 --> 02:46:28.140
Can you make it through that doorway with that hat on?

3514
02:46:28.140 --> 02:46:29.098
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

3515
02:46:29.098 --> 02:46:30.820
(laughter)

3516
02:46:30.820 --> 02:46:33.278
LAURA: Just tilt your head, tilt your head.

3517
02:46:33.278 --> 02:46:35.528
(laughter)

3518
02:46:41.860 --> 02:46:44.350
LIAM: Just be careful of any strong gust of wind

3519
02:46:44.350 --> 02:46:45.790
and you'll be fine.

3520
02:46:45.790 --> 02:46:46.623
TRAVIS: Right.

3521
02:46:47.740 --> 02:46:51.982
LAURA: For Yasha, we got to a beautiful,

3522
02:46:51.982 --> 02:46:55.666
long, black, velvet, fitted evening dress.

3523
02:46:55.666 --> 02:46:56.817
ASHLEY: Oh!

3524
02:46:56.817 --> 02:46:57.650
LAURA: Yeah.

3525
02:46:58.680 --> 02:47:00.138
TALIESIN: Sharp silver lining that just,

3526
02:47:00.138 --> 02:47:02.800
that runs the whole front of it.

3527
02:47:02.800 --> 02:47:04.970
LAURA: The cut goes across your chest like this.

3528
02:47:04.970 --> 02:47:05.928
So your shoulders are out

3529
02:47:05.928 --> 02:47:08.928
and it's got long sleeves that open.

3530
02:47:11.510 --> 02:47:14.410
ASHLEY: It's my favorite color, too, thank you very much.

3531
02:47:14.410 --> 02:47:17.090
[laughter]

3532
02:47:17.090 --> 02:47:18.656
LAURA: For Veth.

3533
02:47:18.656 --> 02:47:19.848
SAM: Hello.

3534
02:47:19.848 --> 02:47:23.610
LAURA: We got you a yellow evening gown.

3535
02:47:23.610 --> 02:47:25.126
SAM: Wonderful.

3536
02:47:25.126 --> 02:47:26.720
LAURA: Almost with the princess cut.

3537
02:47:26.720 --> 02:47:27.553
SAM: Ooh.

3538
02:47:27.553 --> 02:47:30.060
LAURA: Yes, double breasted.

3539
02:47:30.060 --> 02:47:32.567
And it's got silver buttons.

3540
02:47:32.567 --> 02:47:34.700
SAM: Oh, that's so nice.

3541
02:47:34.700 --> 02:47:36.592
LAURA: Lots of buttons.

3542
02:47:36.592 --> 02:47:38.801
TALIESIN: Extra buttons.
SAM: Thank you, I love it.

3543
02:47:38.801 --> 02:47:40.044
LAURA: Caduceus.

3544
02:47:40.044 --> 02:47:43.460
TALIESIN: I've got a sort of mint green frock coat

3545
02:47:43.460 --> 02:47:45.918
with nice pants and boots

3546
02:47:45.918 --> 02:47:48.070
and a nice little little vest, I feel pretty good.

3547
02:47:48.070 --> 02:47:48.903
LAURA: You look very nice.

3548
02:47:48.903 --> 02:47:49.903
TALIESIN: Thank you.

3549
02:47:51.094 --> 02:47:54.270
LAURA: I got a long pink evening gown

3550
02:47:54.270 --> 02:47:57.570
that's very fitted through the bodice and then it

3551
02:47:57.570 --> 02:48:02.570
flares out in very flowy chiffon all the way to the ground.

3552
02:48:02.611 --> 02:48:04.203
MATT: Very nice.

3553
02:48:04.203 --> 02:48:07.203
[cheering]

3554
02:48:09.455 --> 02:48:12.087
It looks like The Mighty Nein's ready for a formal occasion.

3555
02:48:12.087 --> 02:48:12.920
SAM: Yeah.

3556
02:48:12.920 --> 02:48:13.753
MATT: All righty.

3557
02:48:17.782 --> 02:48:19.320
Is there anything else you guys wish to accomplish,

3558
02:48:19.320 --> 02:48:21.900
or do you want to move on to the evening's party?

3559
02:48:21.900 --> 02:48:22.970
TRAVIS: Let's do it.

3560
02:48:22.970 --> 02:48:23.880
LAURA: Let's do it.

3561
02:48:23.880 --> 02:48:24.713
MATT: All righty.

3562
02:48:26.220 --> 02:48:28.457
You guys make your way

3563
02:48:30.510 --> 02:48:32.910
to the Marquis Demesne.

3564
02:48:32.910 --> 02:48:34.150
LAURA: (high-pitched) Eee!

3565
02:48:34.150 --> 02:48:36.410
MATT: So here, within the Opal Archways,

3566
02:48:36.410 --> 02:48:39.390
not too far from the Lavish Chateau,

3567
02:48:39.390 --> 02:48:40.810
you come upon the gated estate--

3568
02:48:40.810 --> 02:48:42.921
LAURA: Wait, wait, wait.
MATT: Oh, oh, oh.

3569
02:48:42.921 --> 02:48:44.396
LAURA: What's Mama wearing?

3570
02:48:45.300 --> 02:48:47.780
MATT: Oh, good call.

3571
02:48:47.780 --> 02:48:50.630
She has a number of dresses at her disposal.

3572
02:48:50.630 --> 02:48:51.997
LAURA: I figured.

3573
02:48:51.997 --> 02:48:54.340
MATT: She picks out one

3574
02:48:54.340 --> 02:48:57.910
to contrast, but also mirror the design

3575
02:48:57.910 --> 02:48:59.820
that you had purchased and brought along,

3576
02:48:59.820 --> 02:49:02.400
except for it's in a deep purple velvet.

3577
02:49:02.400 --> 02:49:04.380
And whereas yours flares out into the chiffon,

3578
02:49:04.380 --> 02:49:09.312
hers hugs her legs like an upside wineglass.

3579
02:49:12.134 --> 02:49:14.270
Kind of Jessica Rabbit-esque, I guess you would say

3580
02:49:14.270 --> 02:49:17.042
with the arm gloves there.

3581
02:49:17.042 --> 02:49:19.830
Beautiful jewelry right around the neck

3582
02:49:19.830 --> 02:49:21.850
and shoulder area.

3583
02:49:21.850 --> 02:49:26.833
I'm not as great at explaining dress wear as you are, but.
LAURA: No, that was fabulous, that's beautiful.

3584
02:49:27.944 --> 02:49:29.295
She looks really nice.

3585
02:49:29.295 --> 02:49:30.930
MATT: She looks amazing.
LAURA: Yeah.

3586
02:49:30.930 --> 02:49:33.759
MATT: You guys help her, she takes your hand

3587
02:49:33.759 --> 02:49:36.217
and you help her pass the threshold of the Chateau

3588
02:49:36.217 --> 02:49:40.117
and you step into the cold night air of Nicodranas.

3589
02:49:40.117 --> 02:49:42.860
And with each few steps she takes another deep breath,

3590
02:49:42.860 --> 02:49:45.820
another deep breath, until eventually you find yourselves

3591
02:49:45.820 --> 02:49:48.630
outside of the Marquis Demesne.

3592
02:49:48.630 --> 02:49:50.530
LAURA: I'm holding her hand very tight.

3593
02:49:50.530 --> 02:49:53.440
MATT: She is holding your head very tight, too.

3594
02:49:53.440 --> 02:49:55.980
You see what is essentially a small palace

3595
02:49:55.980 --> 02:49:59.188
draped in white silks with candle lit lanterns

3596
02:49:59.188 --> 02:50:01.495
that hang from all around the premises.

3597
02:50:01.495 --> 02:50:05.210
Numerous, somewhat gaudy fountains that sit in the entryway,

3598
02:50:05.210 --> 02:50:07.210
which is arched like the Opal Archway,

3599
02:50:07.210 --> 02:50:10.420
but almost in a competitive sense

3600
02:50:10.420 --> 02:50:15.390
with more color and detailed decoration.

3601
02:50:15.390 --> 02:50:16.860
As you guys are brought to the front,

3602
02:50:16.860 --> 02:50:20.858
the guards there at the event seem to be expecting you,

3603
02:50:20.858 --> 02:50:22.885
as upon you arrive, they don't question,

3604
02:50:22.885 --> 02:50:24.890
they just step aside and open the gate for you to enter.

3605
02:50:24.890 --> 02:50:27.230
You can already see there's probably about three dozen

3606
02:50:27.230 --> 02:50:29.960
or so figures that are all lounging

3607
02:50:29.960 --> 02:50:31.370
in the main courtyard area.

3608
02:50:31.370 --> 02:50:33.600
There are servants coming around to fill drinks.

3609
02:50:33.600 --> 02:50:36.916
There are food plates set out on small tables

3610
02:50:36.916 --> 02:50:38.433
that are being delivered around,

3611
02:50:38.433 --> 02:50:40.290
there's a gentle music playing

3612
02:50:40.290 --> 02:50:42.760
in the air, sourceless at the moment.

3613
02:50:42.760 --> 02:50:46.798
But as you begin to walk in, a number of figures that you,

3614
02:50:46.798 --> 02:50:48.250
many of them you do not recognize,

3615
02:50:48.250 --> 02:50:50.930
glance over and take a look.

3616
02:50:50.930 --> 02:50:53.602
A few of them seem caught off-guard

3617
02:50:53.602 --> 02:50:55.503
and wondering who you are.

3618
02:50:55.503 --> 02:50:57.953
A handful see Marion and are

3619
02:50:57.953 --> 02:50:59.109
surprised and delighted

3620
02:50:59.109 --> 02:51:00.300
and a handful of individuals

3621
02:51:00.300 --> 02:51:02.227
are like, "Marion Lavorre, I had no idea

3622
02:51:02.227 --> 02:51:03.060
"you were going to be here tonight.

3623
02:51:03.060 --> 02:51:03.970
"This is incredible.

3624
02:51:03.970 --> 02:51:07.193
"Did you hear the Ruby of the Sea
is going to be performing tonight?"

3625
02:51:07.193 --> 02:51:11.792
And the whispers start going out throughout the chamber.

3626
02:51:11.792 --> 02:51:12.900
Making your way partway in,

3627
02:51:12.900 --> 02:51:16.670
you can see there, as part of the event,

3628
02:51:16.670 --> 02:51:19.450
you see Lord Dezran Thain

3629
02:51:19.450 --> 02:51:23.078
not too far from the Martinet Ludinus himself.

3630
02:51:24.170 --> 02:51:26.753
You can see there is a stout,

3631
02:51:26.753 --> 02:51:31.640
gravelly-looking dwarf with a shock of gray hair,

3632
02:51:31.640 --> 02:51:35.390
like almost silver hair. He has ruddy skin.

3633
02:51:35.390 --> 02:51:39.471
He looks like he's dressed really well
and he just hates the party there

3634
02:51:39.471 --> 02:51:41.880
and he's just not talking to anybody.

3635
02:51:41.880 --> 02:51:45.640
You can see as part of that arrangement there,

3636
02:51:45.640 --> 02:51:47.723
I'm going to get some of my notes out of my way,

3637
02:51:47.723 --> 02:51:50.770
because they get in my way very easily,

3638
02:51:50.770 --> 02:51:53.928
you see Lord Athesius Uludan as well who,

3639
02:51:53.928 --> 02:51:55.469
in the middle of a conversation

3640
02:51:55.469 --> 02:51:57.180
sees you and makes an acknowledgement

3641
02:51:57.180 --> 02:51:59.513
that you're here, but is finishing his current conversation.

3642
02:51:59.513 --> 02:52:02.513
And so the party is yours to peruse.

3643
02:52:03.370 --> 02:52:05.110
It mostly seems conversation-based.

3644
02:52:05.110 --> 02:52:07.310
There's no real events happening at the moment

3645
02:52:07.310 --> 02:52:08.143
and in a short time,

3646
02:52:08.143 --> 02:52:10.851
Marion excuses herself saying,

3647
02:52:10.851 --> 02:52:14.630
"Pardon me, I need to go and prepare for my performance.

3648
02:52:14.630 --> 02:52:15.805
"Thank you."

3649
02:52:15.805 --> 02:52:17.151
Gives a wink to Jester

3650
02:52:17.151 --> 02:52:21.350
and is led into the main building, the palace.

3651
02:52:21.350 --> 02:52:23.950
The courtyard immerses itself

3652
02:52:23.950 --> 02:52:25.950
partway into the building and there is this

3653
02:52:25.950 --> 02:52:27.374
beautiful glass ceiling above everybody

3654
02:52:27.374 --> 02:52:28.865
where you can see the stars

3655
02:52:28.865 --> 02:52:30.410
and where more of these lanterns hang

3656
02:52:30.410 --> 02:52:32.310
and the silks cross over each other

3657
02:52:32.310 --> 02:52:36.518
in this intentionally unbalanced way

3658
02:52:36.518 --> 02:52:40.300
that seems very artistic and avant-garde.

3659
02:52:40.300 --> 02:52:42.410
Some conversations are kept quiet muttering.

3660
02:52:42.410 --> 02:52:45.510
Some of them you can hear loosely about who the hell

3661
02:52:45.510 --> 02:52:49.160
these strange figures are that entered the party.

3662
02:52:49.160 --> 02:52:50.990
Some other folks actually pick up

3663
02:52:50.990 --> 02:52:54.930
and be like, "Are these those Mighty Nein individuals?

3664
02:52:54.930 --> 02:52:57.500
"I heard that they-- the description of them,

3665
02:52:57.500 --> 02:52:59.503
"they did something in Rexxentrum recently.

3666
02:52:59.503 --> 02:53:01.253
"Word's gotten around."

3667
02:53:02.930 --> 02:53:06.570
You do see greeting, with a kiss on the hand to Marion

3668
02:53:06.570 --> 02:53:09.403
as she wanders by being escorted by

3669
02:53:09.403 --> 02:53:11.550
the servants on premises to get ready,

3670
02:53:11.550 --> 02:53:16.430
Lord Robert Sharpe with his thin, creepy mustache,

3671
02:53:16.430 --> 02:53:18.920
his receding hairline,

3672
02:53:18.920 --> 02:53:21.590
this man in his late fifties

3673
02:53:21.590 --> 02:53:23.856
who looks like he's desperately trying to cling

3674
02:53:23.856 --> 02:53:24.817
to an element of his youth

3675
02:53:24.817 --> 02:53:25.775
and in doing so ends up looking

3676
02:53:25.775 --> 02:53:29.580
far older than he would if he just embraced it.

3677
02:53:29.580 --> 02:53:31.720
Well dressed, kisses Marion's hand.

3678
02:53:31.720 --> 02:53:35.497
As she walks by, turns towards your troupe.

3679
02:53:36.350 --> 02:53:38.050
Kind of gives a glance over.

3680
02:53:38.050 --> 02:53:40.340
LAURA: I hide behind Ford, I hide behind Fjord.

3681
02:53:40.340 --> 02:53:42.840
MATT: Roll a stealth check for me.

3682
02:53:43.980 --> 02:53:44.813
LAURA: Okay.

3683
02:53:48.484 --> 02:53:49.784
Okay.

3684
02:53:49.784 --> 02:53:51.002
14.

3685
02:53:51.002 --> 02:53:55.540
MATT: Okay. You hide behind Fjord as best as you think so.

3686
02:53:55.540 --> 02:53:58.970
Lord Sharpe seems to glance over the group

3687
02:53:58.970 --> 02:54:00.920
and notices Yasha

3688
02:54:02.330 --> 02:54:05.452
and walks over and as he approaches,

3689
02:54:09.630 --> 02:54:13.410
"(reedy) My apologies, it seems we have not been introduced.

3690
02:54:13.410 --> 02:54:15.740
"I am Lord Robert Sharpe,

3691
02:54:15.740 --> 02:54:17.948
"one of the many figureheads here of

3692
02:54:17.948 --> 02:54:22.710
"what business goes about successfully within Nicodranas.

3693
02:54:22.710 --> 02:54:26.050
"You look like you're from, are not around here.

3694
02:54:26.050 --> 02:54:27.740
"What is your name,

3695
02:54:27.740 --> 02:54:31.753
"you gorgeous creature?" and he puts his hand out.

3696
02:54:32.789 --> 02:54:34.597
ASHLEY: Oh. Uh.

3697
02:54:34.597 --> 02:54:37.423
My name is Yasha.

3698
02:54:40.319 --> 02:54:41.152
MATT: "Well.

3699
02:54:42.870 --> 02:54:44.600
"The pleasure is mine."

3700
02:54:44.600 --> 02:54:45.970
He takes your hand and pulls it in,

3701
02:54:45.970 --> 02:54:48.314
like abruptly and does a full on kiss.

3702
02:54:48.314 --> 02:54:49.147
ASHLEY: Oh.

3703
02:54:50.530 --> 02:54:53.113
MATT: "Where did you hail from, Yasha?"

3704
02:54:55.424 --> 02:54:56.822
ASHLEY: (nervous laugh)

3705
02:54:56.822 --> 02:54:59.193
[laughter]

3706
02:54:59.193 --> 02:55:02.776
I hail from Xhorhas.

3707
02:55:02.776 --> 02:55:04.662
MATT: "(laughs)"

3708
02:55:04.662 --> 02:55:07.030
ASHLEY: Where are you from?

3709
02:55:07.030 --> 02:55:08.555
MATT: "I've been here my entire life.

3710
02:55:08.555 --> 02:55:11.300
"But no, seriously, where are you from?"

3711
02:55:11.300 --> 02:55:13.147
He is ignoring all of you.

3712
02:55:13.147 --> 02:55:14.830
The rest of the group does not exist.

3713
02:55:14.830 --> 02:55:16.260
Kind of a benefit to you at the moment, Jester.

3714
02:55:16.260 --> 02:55:18.018
LAURA: Yeah, yeah,

3715
02:55:18.018 --> 02:55:20.110
ASHLEY: I look over at Jester.

3716
02:55:20.110 --> 02:55:22.193
LAURA: (squeaking) Don't look at me.

3717
02:55:22.193 --> 02:55:23.826
MATT: You don't know where Jester is.

3718
02:55:23.826 --> 02:55:25.801
MARISHA: (whispering) Yasha.

3719
02:55:26.784 --> 02:55:29.784
[laughter]

3720
02:55:34.070 --> 02:55:36.153
MATT: "I'm sorry, are you shy?"

3721
02:55:39.220 --> 02:55:41.111
ASHLEY: Yeah, yes.

3722
02:55:41.111 --> 02:55:43.917
MATT: "You don't have to be."

3723
02:55:43.917 --> 02:55:48.216
ASHLEY: Well, I think, my friends are

3724
02:55:48.216 --> 02:55:49.541
getting smaller?

3725
02:55:49.541 --> 02:55:52.483
[laughter]

3726
02:55:53.680 --> 02:55:56.065
That's not what I meant to say.

3727
02:55:57.250 --> 02:56:00.833
They're over there and I think I need to

3728
02:56:00.833 --> 02:56:04.080
go over to there.

3729
02:56:04.080 --> 02:56:05.088
Yeah.

3730
02:56:05.088 --> 02:56:06.427
MATT: "Well, let me escort you,"

3731
02:56:06.427 --> 02:56:09.213
and he scoops his arm into yours.
LAURA: Ugh!

3732
02:56:09.213 --> 02:56:11.270
That's it, I step out from behind Fjord.

3733
02:56:11.270 --> 02:56:12.280
MATT: Okay.

3734
02:56:12.280 --> 02:56:14.863
LAURA: Leave her alone, creep!

3735
02:56:14.863 --> 02:56:18.946
[laughter and applause]

3736
02:56:23.320 --> 02:56:27.212
MATT: Pulls his hand out from your arm and goes,

3737
02:56:28.210 --> 02:56:29.960
"Interesting."

3738
02:56:31.440 --> 02:56:35.561
LAURA: Yep, I'm here. What're you going to do about it?

3739
02:56:35.561 --> 02:56:38.712
[cheering]

3740
02:56:38.712 --> 02:56:42.241
MATT: "You'll find out soon enough,"

3741
02:56:42.241 --> 02:56:43.730
and he walks away.

3742
02:56:43.730 --> 02:56:44.757
SAM: Oh.

3743
02:56:44.757 --> 02:56:46.774
LAURA: I cast Charm Person.

3744
02:56:46.774 --> 02:56:49.774
[cheering]

3745
02:56:54.370 --> 02:56:56.986
MATT: I think a six is a failure, so.

3746
02:56:56.986 --> 02:56:59.059
(laughter)

3747
02:56:59.059 --> 02:57:03.850
He walks away and kind of like, "I am terribly sorry.

3748
02:57:03.850 --> 02:57:04.955
"That was very rude of me."

3749
02:57:04.955 --> 02:57:07.336
LAURA: No, I, it's fine. It's fine.

3750
02:57:07.336 --> 02:57:10.500
MATT: "I feel like we got off on
the wrong foot a long time ago."

3751
02:57:10.500 --> 02:57:11.760
LAURA: We really did.

3752
02:57:11.760 --> 02:57:14.933
And you know what you should do is just apologize

3753
02:57:14.933 --> 02:57:18.546
to everyone you've ever met.

3754
02:57:18.546 --> 02:57:23.404
[laughter and cheering]

3755
02:57:23.404 --> 02:57:28.117
[laughter and cheering]

3756
02:57:28.117 --> 02:57:33.003
[laughter and cheering]

3757
02:57:33.003 --> 02:57:36.411
MATT: "Oh, you are a funny one still to this day.

3758
02:57:36.411 --> 02:57:37.660
"Would you like a drink?"

3759
02:57:37.660 --> 02:57:38.493
LAURA: Nope.

3760
02:57:39.770 --> 02:57:41.410
MATT: "Anything else I could get you?"

3761
02:57:41.410 --> 02:57:43.554
LAURA: No, you know what you could do, though?

3762
02:57:43.554 --> 02:57:44.440
MATT: "Hmm?"

3763
02:57:44.440 --> 02:57:48.641
LAURA: I left my gloves,

3764
02:57:48.641 --> 02:57:49.795
I've got no gloves on.

3765
02:57:49.795 --> 02:57:53.338
I left my gloves out on the balcony.

3766
02:57:53.338 --> 02:57:55.338
[laughter]

3767
02:57:55.338 --> 02:57:57.746
I was wondering if you could go fetch them for me.

3768
02:57:57.746 --> 02:57:59.660
MATT: "What, upstairs?"

3769
02:57:59.660 --> 02:58:01.318
LAURA: Yes.

3770
02:58:01.318 --> 02:58:03.838
MATT: "Which balcony? There are several."

3771
02:58:03.838 --> 02:58:05.300
LAURA: You see that one over there?

3772
02:58:05.300 --> 02:58:06.241
MATT: "That one right there."

3773
02:58:06.241 --> 02:58:08.280
LAURA: That one. I was--

3774
02:58:08.280 --> 02:58:12.047
I was standing outside earlier and I left them there.

3775
02:58:13.790 --> 02:58:17.180
It would mean so much if you could get them for me.

3776
02:58:17.180 --> 02:58:20.005
MATT: "I am a fan of burying such hatchets.

3777
02:58:21.470 --> 02:58:22.303
"I'll be back."

3778
02:58:22.303 --> 02:58:23.136
LAURA: Okay.

3779
02:58:24.970 --> 02:58:26.903
MATT: "Could I get you anything?"

3780
02:58:27.880 --> 02:58:29.970
ASHLEY: You could just go away.

3781
02:58:29.970 --> 02:58:32.970
[laughter]

3782
02:58:37.041 --> 02:58:40.750
MATT: And he exits to search for your gloves.

3783
02:58:40.750 --> 02:58:42.939
SAM: What's the play here, Jester?

3784
02:58:42.939 --> 02:58:45.011
Are we going to go up there on the balcony and kill him?

3785
02:58:45.011 --> 02:58:46.578
[laughter]

3786
02:58:46.578 --> 02:58:50.661
LAURA: No, I'm going to watch when he goes up there.

3787
02:58:52.079 --> 02:58:53.437
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

3788
02:58:54.340 --> 02:58:56.591
MATT: It takes about six or seven minutes or so,

3789
02:58:56.591 --> 02:58:59.010
but eventually you see him wander out onto the balcony

3790
02:58:59.010 --> 02:59:01.937
after opening the sliding door the leads out there.

3791
02:59:01.937 --> 02:59:05.351
LAURA: I go up there really fast
and I shut the door and I lock it.

3792
02:59:05.351 --> 02:59:07.601
[laughter]

3793
02:59:08.745 --> 02:59:10.234
MATT: (laughs)

3794
02:59:10.234 --> 02:59:12.759
ASHLEY: (laughs)

3795
02:59:14.717 --> 02:59:17.330
MATT: You back away just in time as you see the door

3796
02:59:17.330 --> 02:59:20.038
as it slides over and latches.

3797
02:59:20.038 --> 02:59:22.490
(door closing and latching)

3798
02:59:22.490 --> 02:59:23.948
"Oh no."

3799
02:59:23.948 --> 02:59:27.109
[laughter]

3800
02:59:27.109 --> 02:59:29.467
SAM: I'll come up next to her and say:

3801
02:59:29.467 --> 02:59:30.490
Let me jimmy the lock.

3802
02:59:30.490 --> 02:59:31.323
LAURA: No, no, no.

3803
02:59:31.323 --> 02:59:33.289
SAM: And I'll stick the dagger in.

3804
02:59:33.289 --> 02:59:34.431
LAURA: (gasping)

3805
02:59:34.431 --> 02:59:36.648
(laughter)

3806
02:59:36.648 --> 02:59:41.648
(laughter)
[laughter and cheering]

3807
02:59:41.650 --> 02:59:46.640
(laughter)
[laughter and cheering]

3808
02:59:46.640 --> 02:59:48.473
MATT: Could you please--
SAM: Turn it.

3809
02:59:48.473 --> 02:59:50.800
MATT: -- explain what the dagger
does for those who aren't aware?

3810
02:59:50.800 --> 02:59:52.860
SAM: The Dagger of Denial.

3811
02:59:55.040 --> 02:59:56.357
I can place the point of the blade

3812
02:59:56.357 --> 02:59:58.216
into any keyhole and seal it shut.

3813
02:59:58.216 --> 02:59:59.686
A keyhole sealed in this way

3814
02:59:59.686 --> 03:00:02.203
cannot be unlocked

3815
03:00:02.203 --> 03:00:07.203
until the dagger is placed into the keyhole once more.

3816
03:00:07.435 --> 03:00:09.252
It's locked forever.

3817
03:00:09.252 --> 03:00:10.978
[laughter]

3818
03:00:10.978 --> 03:00:12.490
MATT: Or until you use the dagger again.

3819
03:00:12.490 --> 03:00:13.730
LAURA: Yeah.

3820
03:00:13.730 --> 03:00:17.264
MATT: But you're now feel the (pounding on door)

3821
03:00:17.264 --> 03:00:19.705
"(nervous laugh) I'm just enjoyed some air, don't worry."

3822
03:00:19.705 --> 03:00:20.788
(laughter)

3823
03:00:20.788 --> 03:00:23.520
(pounding on door) "Son of a..."

3824
03:00:23.520 --> 03:00:28.400
LAURA: He's going to be so pissed, you guys, so pissed.

3825
03:00:28.400 --> 03:00:30.620
ASHLEY: I'm never wearing this dress again.

3826
03:00:30.620 --> 03:00:31.970
LAURA: No, you look really good. Yasha.

3827
03:00:31.970 --> 03:00:35.140
ASHLEY: I've never had that happen
to me before, and that was--

3828
03:00:35.140 --> 03:00:38.059
LAURA: Next time it happens, feel
free to just punch the guy.

3829
03:00:38.059 --> 03:00:38.892
SAM: Yeah.

3830
03:00:38.892 --> 03:00:39.750
LAURA: Punch him.

3831
03:00:39.750 --> 03:00:43.300
ASHLEY: So if a guy comes up to you and says nice things--

3832
03:00:43.300 --> 03:00:44.820
LAURA: No, if he compliments you, it's fine,

3833
03:00:44.820 --> 03:00:47.601
but if he's smarmy about it and if he's grabbing you,

3834
03:00:47.601 --> 03:00:49.101
fucking punch him.

3835
03:00:50.190 --> 03:00:54.556
[cheering]

3836
03:00:54.556 --> 03:00:56.684
TALIESIN: Yeah, I don't think the
dress enters into it, really.

3837
03:00:56.684 --> 03:00:57.808
LAURA: No.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3838
03:00:57.808 --> 03:01:00.086
LAURA: There's no excuse.
TALIESIN: I'm very proud of this right now.

3839
03:01:00.086 --> 03:01:01.477
ASHLEY: Okay, no, it's beautiful.

3840
03:01:01.477 --> 03:01:03.820
It's great. It's great!

3841
03:01:03.820 --> 03:01:05.773
MARISHA: We could still kill him.

3842
03:01:05.773 --> 03:01:07.561
[laughter]

3843
03:01:07.561 --> 03:01:10.593
I'm kind of with Yasha's idea here.

3844
03:01:10.593 --> 03:01:12.429
TRAVIS: I think we have more pressing concerns.

3845
03:01:12.429 --> 03:01:13.262
SAM: Oh, that's right.

3846
03:01:13.262 --> 03:01:16.516
ASHLEY: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
LAURA: Yup, yes, yes.

3847
03:01:16.516 --> 03:01:18.567
TALIESIN: We're decided, by the
way, did I have time yesterday

3848
03:01:18.567 --> 03:01:21.160
to just go buy like, like, 20 to 50,

3849
03:01:21.160 --> 03:01:23.607
20 to 50 GP worth of magical,

3850
03:01:23.607 --> 03:01:26.894
of just, magic stuff to cast spells?

3851
03:01:26.894 --> 03:01:27.727
MATT: Components and stuff?

3852
03:01:27.727 --> 03:01:28.560
TALIESIN: Yeah, components.

3853
03:01:28.560 --> 03:01:30.226
MATT: Sure. If you want.
TALIESIN: Cool, thank you.

3854
03:01:30.226 --> 03:01:31.436
Putting that in.

3855
03:01:31.436 --> 03:01:33.502
MARISHA: We got to find--
TRAVIS: Dezran Thain.

3856
03:01:33.502 --> 03:01:35.610
MARISHA: Yes.
LAURA: Oh, do we see him?

3857
03:01:35.610 --> 03:01:37.126
MATT: Yes. You've seen him at the party

3858
03:01:37.126 --> 03:01:41.520
as well Lucius, as the Martinet Ludinus.

3859
03:01:41.520 --> 03:01:43.450
They are present--

3860
03:01:43.450 --> 03:01:45.100
LIAM: Are there any Volstrucker here?

3861
03:01:46.040 --> 03:01:47.890
MATT: You do not notice any Volstrucker.

3862
03:01:47.890 --> 03:01:50.642
You do not notice Trent Ikithon.

3863
03:01:51.600 --> 03:01:54.110
You do see the emissary Lord Zeddan Graf,

3864
03:01:54.110 --> 03:01:58.540
who is a member of the Dwendalian Empire

3865
03:01:58.540 --> 03:02:01.440
and acts as an emissary

3866
03:02:01.440 --> 03:02:05.714
similar to what Athesius does for the Cerberus Assembly,

3867
03:02:05.714 --> 03:02:08.763
Zeddan Graf does for the Dwendalian Empire.

3868
03:02:08.763 --> 03:02:09.596
LIAM: Okay.

3869
03:02:10.868 --> 03:02:12.379
MATT: So the, like, the two different

3870
03:02:12.379 --> 03:02:15.087
social representatives here.

3871
03:02:15.087 --> 03:02:17.785
but Athesius Uludan is the one who is related to

3872
03:02:17.785 --> 03:02:20.596
the person who's running this party and owns this place,

3873
03:02:20.596 --> 03:02:22.641
which is--

3874
03:02:22.641 --> 03:02:23.672
MARISHA: The Marquis?

3875
03:02:23.672 --> 03:02:25.410
MATT: Yeah, the Marquis of Nicodranas.

3876
03:02:25.410 --> 03:02:27.100
MARISHA: Do we see him?

3877
03:02:27.100 --> 03:02:29.040
MATT: You do, yeah.

3878
03:02:29.040 --> 03:02:31.870
The Marquis is currently holding court

3879
03:02:31.870 --> 03:02:33.828
amongst a number of other nobles as more people

3880
03:02:33.828 --> 03:02:36.505
filter in and he goes to greet them as they enter,

3881
03:02:36.505 --> 03:02:39.430
eventually noticing your group and as he approaches,

3882
03:02:39.430 --> 03:02:44.422
you can see he's a stout but strong-looking man,

3883
03:02:45.849 --> 03:02:48.760
probably in his mid fifties,

3884
03:02:48.760 --> 03:02:53.470
dark hair that is greased back on top

3885
03:02:53.470 --> 03:02:55.570
and then falls down to almost his mid back below.

3886
03:02:55.570 --> 03:02:59.080
And he wears this soft white cloth hat on top

3887
03:02:59.080 --> 03:03:02.230
that raises up into a point with a beautiful gem

3888
03:03:02.230 --> 03:03:04.688
emblazoned on the front of it.

3889
03:03:04.688 --> 03:03:07.340
He has a mustache that is kept,

3890
03:03:07.340 --> 03:03:10.173
almost becomes a full

3891
03:03:10.173 --> 03:03:11.660
Stonewall type mustache point,

3892
03:03:11.660 --> 03:03:13.180
but it's carved in the center there.

3893
03:03:13.180 --> 03:03:16.013
So it just is this really awful floppy mustache.

3894
03:03:16.013 --> 03:03:17.620
(laughter)

3895
03:03:17.620 --> 03:03:22.318
But as he approaches and extends his hand to you all,

3896
03:03:22.318 --> 03:03:27.010
"I do not know these people necessarily before me,

3897
03:03:27.010 --> 03:03:29.301
"but I've been told that your arrival as friends

3898
03:03:29.301 --> 03:03:33.259
"of the Assembly, which makes you friends of the Marquis.

3899
03:03:33.259 --> 03:03:36.200
"So who are you?"

3900
03:03:36.200 --> 03:03:38.070
TRAVIS: Oh, it's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.

3901
03:03:38.070 --> 03:03:40.737
We are known as the Mighty Nein.

3902
03:03:42.090 --> 03:03:44.890
MATT: "Well, Mighty Nein,

3903
03:03:44.890 --> 03:03:47.544
"enjoy of the delights we have placed before you.

3904
03:03:47.544 --> 03:03:48.677
"Have a wonderful night.

3905
03:03:48.677 --> 03:03:50.600
"Do not break anything."

3906
03:03:50.600 --> 03:03:52.260
LAURA: Never.

3907
03:03:52.260 --> 03:03:53.510
TALIESIN: Probably not.

3908
03:03:54.501 --> 03:03:55.501
MATT: "Thank you."

3909
03:03:56.507 --> 03:03:58.100
And he goes and immediately shrugs you off,

3910
03:03:58.100 --> 03:03:59.990
has lost his interest in conversation with you

3911
03:03:59.990 --> 03:04:02.510
almost as fast as you made your introductions.

3912
03:04:02.510 --> 03:04:04.630
MARISHA: Any interesting pairings,

3913
03:04:04.630 --> 03:04:08.420
anyone having hushed side conversations,

3914
03:04:08.420 --> 03:04:10.080
any weird looks?

3915
03:04:12.580 --> 03:04:17.038
MATT: You do notice within a short time that

3916
03:04:17.038 --> 03:04:21.310
Lord Dezran Thain notices your arrival

3917
03:04:21.310 --> 03:04:24.320
and about maybe 20 or so minutes,

3918
03:04:24.320 --> 03:04:26.110
30 or so minutes into your stay,

3919
03:04:26.110 --> 03:04:29.235
you notice him keeping entirely on the opposite side

3920
03:04:29.235 --> 03:04:30.334
of the party to you guys.

3921
03:04:30.334 --> 03:04:31.892
Every time you shift somewhere,

3922
03:04:31.892 --> 03:04:33.300
he shifts to keep elsewhere.

3923
03:04:33.300 --> 03:04:35.690
There is definitely an intentional dance

3924
03:04:35.690 --> 03:04:37.107
to avoid you all.

3925
03:04:38.023 --> 03:04:39.106
LAURA: Lord Thain.

3926
03:04:40.530 --> 03:04:43.174
TALIESIN: That's one way to do it.

3927
03:04:43.174 --> 03:04:44.821
LAURA: Hi.

3928
03:04:44.821 --> 03:04:47.529
Hi, good to see you again.

3929
03:04:47.529 --> 03:04:48.362
Come here.

3930
03:04:49.717 --> 03:04:50.930
Come on, come on, come on.

3931
03:04:50.930 --> 03:04:52.980
MATT: He gets a drink off one of the platters.

3932
03:04:55.032 --> 03:04:57.507
SAM: Jester, Jester.
LAURA: What?

3933
03:04:57.507 --> 03:05:00.690
SAM: Maybe we should play it a little cooler, all right.

3934
03:05:00.690 --> 03:05:03.670
Maybe when your mom is performing we can go over

3935
03:05:04.740 --> 03:05:06.590
and, like, Zone of Truth him,

3936
03:05:06.590 --> 03:05:10.464
or Charm him or do one of your tricks.

3937
03:05:10.464 --> 03:05:12.742
You have lots of great tricks.

3938
03:05:12.742 --> 03:05:15.260
LAURA: Yeah, I could do that, sure.

3939
03:05:15.260 --> 03:05:16.450
SAM: I mean, otherwise,

3940
03:05:16.450 --> 03:05:19.070
what-- are we just going to eavesdrop?

3941
03:05:19.070 --> 03:05:20.050
MARISHA: Yes.

3942
03:05:20.050 --> 03:05:20.900
SAM: Okay.

3943
03:05:20.900 --> 03:05:23.450
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm real fucking good at it actually.

3944
03:05:23.450 --> 03:05:24.820
SAM: Do you want me to go invisible?

3945
03:05:24.820 --> 03:05:27.750
Do you want me to sneak around and listen to some convos?

3946
03:05:27.750 --> 03:05:28.583
LAURA: That's smart.

3947
03:05:28.583 --> 03:05:32.758
MARISHA: I think we should all split up and mingle,

3948
03:05:32.758 --> 03:05:36.117
is what I think we should do.
LAURA: Ooh, good idea.

3949
03:05:36.117 --> 03:05:39.430
TALIESIN: Beau, when you're ready,

3950
03:05:39.430 --> 03:05:43.730
I can do a pretty neat trick, but it'll only lasts an hour,

3951
03:05:43.730 --> 03:05:45.943
so I want to save it.

3952
03:05:45.943 --> 03:05:47.543
MARISHA: What does it do?
TALIESIN: I can make--

3953
03:05:47.543 --> 03:05:48.965
MARISHA: How will I know when I'm ready?

3954
03:05:48.965 --> 03:05:50.670
TALIESIN: I don't know, but if--

3955
03:05:50.670 --> 03:05:52.359
MARISHA: That's-- no.

3956
03:05:52.359 --> 03:05:53.993
[laughter]

3957
03:05:53.993 --> 03:05:58.493
TALIESIN: How would you like an
hour of being your best self?

3958
03:06:00.380 --> 03:06:02.588
SAM: Sounds like meth.

3959
03:06:02.588 --> 03:06:07.588
(laughter)

3960
03:06:08.297 --> 03:06:10.463
MARISHA: I don't know if I'm ready to see that.

3961
03:06:10.463 --> 03:06:11.713
TALIESIN: Really really quick,

3962
03:06:11.713 --> 03:06:14.592
just come with me to a balcony, not that balcony,

3963
03:06:14.592 --> 03:06:16.910
one of the other, not that one.

3964
03:06:16.910 --> 03:06:19.118
TALIESIN: You realize this is how--

3965
03:06:19.118 --> 03:06:23.451
you sound like the last thing people hear sometimes.

3966
03:06:24.830 --> 03:06:27.038
TALIESIN: We often are the last thing people hear sometimes.

3967
03:06:27.038 --> 03:06:28.661
(laughter)

3968
03:06:28.661 --> 03:06:29.494
MARISHA: Yeah, that's fair.
TALIESIN: I think that's

3969
03:06:29.494 --> 03:06:30.802
kind of what we sound like.

3970
03:06:30.802 --> 03:06:32.520
MARISHA: Okay, yeah.

3971
03:06:32.520 --> 03:06:33.353
TALIESIN: All right.
TRAVIS: And if we're going to

3972
03:06:33.353 --> 03:06:36.186
split up and mingle,

3973
03:06:36.186 --> 03:06:38.230
just because we don't seem to know much about these people,

3974
03:06:38.230 --> 03:06:40.180
can I cast Divine Sense

3975
03:06:40.180 --> 03:06:43.030
and see if there are any celestial, fiend, or undead

3976
03:06:43.030 --> 03:06:44.910
within 60 feet of this room?

3977
03:06:44.910 --> 03:06:46.200
MATT: Okay. Yeah.

3978
03:06:46.200 --> 03:06:48.060
You focus and close your eyes

3979
03:06:48.060 --> 03:06:51.470
and feel the light fade from your vision

3980
03:06:51.470 --> 03:06:55.494
as your intent expands out around you.

3981
03:06:55.494 --> 03:06:59.730
No, nobody of that essence catches your attention,

3982
03:06:59.730 --> 03:07:01.580
which is comforting.

3983
03:07:03.918 --> 03:07:05.110
Did you guys scatter a bit?

3984
03:07:05.110 --> 03:07:06.318
SAM: Yeah, we'll scatter.

3985
03:07:06.318 --> 03:07:07.520
MARISHA: I go with Caduceus.

3986
03:07:07.520 --> 03:07:08.690
TALIESIN: You'll like it.

3987
03:07:08.690 --> 03:07:11.940
SAM: I'm going to find a little vestibule and go invisible.

3988
03:07:11.940 --> 03:07:12.773
MATT: Okay.

3989
03:07:12.773 --> 03:07:17.140
SAM: And then wander close around to where Thain is.

3990
03:07:17.140 --> 03:07:20.331
Just sort of see if I can pick up some convos.

3991
03:07:20.331 --> 03:07:21.643
MATT: Okay.

3992
03:07:21.643 --> 03:07:26.380
LAURA: I'm going to cast Enhance Ability on myself

3993
03:07:26.380 --> 03:07:29.700
and cast Owl's Wisdom to increase my perception.

3994
03:07:29.700 --> 03:07:31.485
MATT: Okay. All righty.

3995
03:07:32.360 --> 03:07:34.693
You go ahead and take Beau

3996
03:07:34.693 --> 03:07:38.100
around one of the nooks of this interior courtyard

3997
03:07:38.100 --> 03:07:41.930
to where most anybody would be able to see.

3998
03:07:41.930 --> 03:07:46.263
TALIESIN: I cast Tongues, and I cast--

3999
03:07:46.263 --> 03:07:48.365
LAURA: And just make out with her.

4000
03:07:48.365 --> 03:07:51.735
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, it's not that kind of...

4001
03:07:51.735 --> 03:07:55.985
MARISHA: I see what you mean by my best self now, yeah.

4002
03:07:55.985 --> 03:07:58.943
[laughter]

4003
03:07:58.943 --> 03:08:00.688
You're fucking insightful, Caduceus.

4004
03:08:00.688 --> 03:08:03.079
TALIESIN: I take this little mushroom ball

4005
03:08:03.079 --> 03:08:07.779
out of my stash and I squeeze just a little bit of

4006
03:08:08.921 --> 03:08:11.710
juice from it and I just flick it in your eyes.

4007
03:08:11.710 --> 03:08:12.835
MARISHA: Ah, ow!

4008
03:08:12.835 --> 03:08:15.808
TALIESIN: And I cast True Seeing.

4009
03:08:15.808 --> 03:08:18.310
[oohing]

4010
03:08:18.310 --> 03:08:20.600
TALIESIN: So for the next hour, for the next hour,

4011
03:08:20.600 --> 03:08:24.440
you can understand every language.

4012
03:08:24.440 --> 03:08:28.389
If you speak, you're also understood, so be careful.

4013
03:08:28.389 --> 03:08:31.990
Also you can, for an hour you have true sight.

4014
03:08:31.990 --> 03:08:34.170
You can see secret doors that are hidden by magic

4015
03:08:34.170 --> 03:08:38.805
and you can see into the ethereal plane for up to 120 feet.

4016
03:08:38.805 --> 03:08:43.160
MATT: So Beauregard, he flicks this in your eyes,

4017
03:08:43.160 --> 03:08:46.372
you go, ow, and as you open them,

4018
03:08:46.372 --> 03:08:49.597
there is a sea of strange

4019
03:08:49.597 --> 03:08:51.560
purple-ish blue color around you.

4020
03:08:51.560 --> 03:08:52.393
You see--

4021
03:08:52.393 --> 03:08:53.226
MARISHA: (screams)

4022
03:08:53.226 --> 03:08:54.559
(laughter)

4023
03:08:54.559 --> 03:08:56.845
SAM: Yep, it's meth, it's meth.

4024
03:08:56.845 --> 03:08:59.700
[laughter]

4025
03:08:59.700 --> 03:09:03.817
MATT: Odd shapes of effuse smattering

4026
03:09:03.817 --> 03:09:07.200
like sky floating, ethereal creatures

4027
03:09:07.200 --> 03:09:09.784
like elongated ghost fish.
MARISHA: Fuck, you got to fucking tell me.

4028
03:09:09.784 --> 03:09:11.477
TALIESIN: I cast Calm Emotions.

4029
03:09:11.477 --> 03:09:16.277
[laughter]

4030
03:09:20.018 --> 03:09:21.598
TALIESIN: You cool?
MARISHA: Yeah.

4031
03:09:21.598 --> 03:09:26.432
[laughter]

4032
03:09:28.537 --> 03:09:29.487
MARISHA: Let's do this.

4033
03:09:29.487 --> 03:09:30.550
TALIESIN: Get out there and do your thing.

4034
03:09:30.550 --> 03:09:31.550
MARISHA: All right.

4035
03:09:33.034 --> 03:09:36.451
MATT: Wow, all right,

4036
03:09:37.349 --> 03:09:38.682
so the party is your oyster.

4037
03:09:38.682 --> 03:09:40.170
Many individuals talking about,

4038
03:09:40.170 --> 03:09:42.278
<i>you</i> can see,

4039
03:09:43.753 --> 03:09:48.440
one, you can see Lord Dezran Thain very clearly Essek.

4040
03:09:48.440 --> 03:09:50.620
The illusion is bypassed entirely.

4041
03:09:50.620 --> 03:09:53.370
MARISHA: I have a hard time not
staring at him in a weird way.

4042
03:09:54.620 --> 03:09:55.790
MATT: Fair enough.

4043
03:09:55.790 --> 03:09:57.782
MARISHA: And then I try to break.

4044
03:09:59.510 --> 03:10:01.843
MATT: You do glance over and see

4045
03:10:02.918 --> 03:10:04.931
about four of the individuals here

4046
03:10:04.931 --> 03:10:08.139
are using, glamor illusion magic

4047
03:10:08.139 --> 03:10:11.956
to make themselves look about 30 pounds lighter.

4048
03:10:11.956 --> 03:10:13.828
[laughter]

4049
03:10:13.828 --> 03:10:16.136
And their clothing much shinier

4050
03:10:16.136 --> 03:10:17.520
and much more expensive looking.

4051
03:10:17.520 --> 03:10:21.095
MARISHA: I immediately point all of them out to jester.

4052
03:10:21.095 --> 03:10:22.395
LAURA: Really!? (gasps)

4053
03:10:22.395 --> 03:10:23.469
MARISHA: Yeah.

4054
03:10:23.469 --> 03:10:25.644
LAURA: What!?
MARISHA: (shushes)

4055
03:10:27.390 --> 03:10:29.920
MATT: You see one figure that's
in the middle of a conversation

4056
03:10:29.920 --> 03:10:32.528
that the illusion that's put over them

4057
03:10:32.528 --> 03:10:36.103
is that of a very debonair looking,

4058
03:10:36.103 --> 03:10:38.769
Dwendalian noble type individual.

4059
03:10:38.769 --> 03:10:39.980
But it is an illusion and behind that,

4060
03:10:39.980 --> 03:10:44.920
you see, instead a black scale dragonborn with a long tail.

4061
03:10:46.830 --> 03:10:47.913
MARISHA: Xhorhasian?

4062
03:10:50.010 --> 03:10:54.260
MATT: Make a history check.
MARISHA: I mean, like, by the clothes?

4063
03:10:54.260 --> 03:10:56.900
MATT: The clothing is actually what they're wearing,

4064
03:10:56.900 --> 03:11:00.208
but the form itself is different.

4065
03:11:00.208 --> 03:11:01.316
Aww.

4066
03:11:02.620 --> 03:11:04.286
MARISHA: I'm too high.

4067
03:11:04.286 --> 03:11:05.119
MATT: Apparently.

4068
03:11:05.119 --> 03:11:07.205
(laughter)

4069
03:11:07.205 --> 03:11:08.700
But yeah, so it's unique.

4070
03:11:08.700 --> 03:11:10.033
Looking at this event, there is

4071
03:11:10.033 --> 03:11:15.008
a lot of falsehoods being presented.

4072
03:11:16.093 --> 03:11:20.093
MARISHA: I point out the dragonborn disguised to Fjord.

4073
03:11:21.180 --> 03:11:24.872
Dragonborn, not Dwendalian.

4074
03:11:24.872 --> 03:11:26.642
TRAVIS: Okay.

4075
03:11:26.642 --> 03:11:30.760
LAURA: What's his tail doing, like, what's his tail doing?

4076
03:11:30.760 --> 03:11:33.090
MARISHA: What's his tail doing?

4077
03:11:33.090 --> 03:11:35.980
LAURA: How are people not tripping on it?

4078
03:11:35.980 --> 03:11:36.910
MARISHA: Does he have a tail?

4079
03:11:36.910 --> 03:11:39.220
MATT: He does and it's curled around

4080
03:11:39.220 --> 03:11:41.490
the side to not cause that problem.

4081
03:11:41.490 --> 03:11:42.948
MARISHA: He's tucking.

4082
03:11:42.948 --> 03:11:46.990
[laughter]

4083
03:11:48.380 --> 03:11:50.130
TALIESIN: Everything I wanted.

4084
03:11:53.620 --> 03:11:55.133
MATT: But yeah, so you get the sense--

4085
03:11:55.133 --> 03:11:58.191
MARISHA: What else? Secret doors, secret passages?

4086
03:11:58.191 --> 03:12:01.390
MATT: In this immediate courtyard
you don't see any secret doors

4087
03:12:01.390 --> 03:12:02.790
or secret passages, no.

4088
03:12:02.790 --> 03:12:03.623
MARISHA: Inside?

4089
03:12:04.461 --> 03:12:07.100
MATT: Do you want to go explore the house?

4090
03:12:07.100 --> 03:12:07.933
MARISHA: Yeah.

4091
03:12:07.933 --> 03:12:08.766
TALIESIN: Got an hour.
LAURA: What?

4092
03:12:08.766 --> 03:12:09.630
[laughter]

4093
03:12:09.630 --> 03:12:10.740
MARISHA: Can I get inside?

4094
03:12:10.740 --> 03:12:12.660
TRAVIS: Oh god.

4095
03:12:12.660 --> 03:12:14.660
MATT: You can certainly try.

4096
03:12:15.735 --> 03:12:17.674
LAURA: But we're not here to explore.

4097
03:12:17.674 --> 03:12:19.070
TRAVIS: Stick to the plan.

4098
03:12:19.070 --> 03:12:20.712
LAURA: Stick to the plan.

4099
03:12:23.450 --> 03:12:24.283
MARISHA: Okay.

4100
03:12:25.488 --> 03:12:27.262
TALIESIN: Next time.
MARISHA: 20 more minutes.

4101
03:12:27.262 --> 03:12:29.470
TRAVIS: There are lots of people in military garb.

4102
03:12:29.470 --> 03:12:31.340
Anyone that might be denoted as a captain,

4103
03:12:31.340 --> 03:12:34.090
maybe of the Blue Heaven, per se?

4104
03:12:35.110 --> 03:12:37.170
MATT: Actually, you do see

4105
03:12:37.170 --> 03:12:41.230
briefly talking to the rather intense looking dwarf

4106
03:12:41.230 --> 03:12:42.570
that was unhappy there,

4107
03:12:42.570 --> 03:12:44.780
another dwarf is talking to him who is dressed

4108
03:12:44.780 --> 03:12:45.950
in a very familiar,

4109
03:12:47.480 --> 03:12:49.860
captain attire of the Empire.

4110
03:12:49.860 --> 03:12:50.693
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

4111
03:12:50.693 --> 03:12:52.390
Can I make my way over to that dwarf?

4112
03:12:52.390 --> 03:12:54.200
MATT: Sure. As you approach, you can see it,

4113
03:12:54.200 --> 03:12:58.690
it's a male dwarf, salt and pepper hair.

4114
03:12:58.690 --> 03:13:00.370
It's short on top,

4115
03:13:00.370 --> 03:13:02.900
a smooth beard that comes to a little golden ring

4116
03:13:02.900 --> 03:13:03.995
at the bottom.

4117
03:13:03.995 --> 03:13:07.250
There's a little tuft at the end of it.

4118
03:13:07.250 --> 03:13:09.760
He has a number of decorations in the front of his lapel,

4119
03:13:09.760 --> 03:13:11.010
it's buttoned over.

4120
03:13:11.010 --> 03:13:13.509
And they're both sitting there next to each other.

4121
03:13:13.509 --> 03:13:15.284
You can see the one who's with the silver hair

4122
03:13:15.284 --> 03:13:16.605
is really, really grumpy.

4123
03:13:16.605 --> 03:13:20.639
Is just, like, slamming wine flute after wine flute

4124
03:13:20.639 --> 03:13:22.787
and is starting to get kind of rowdy.

4125
03:13:22.787 --> 03:13:23.620
The other one's like,

4126
03:13:23.620 --> 03:13:25.453
"Hold it back, hold it back.

4127
03:13:25.453 --> 03:13:27.380
"Don't worry, don't worry."

4128
03:13:27.380 --> 03:13:28.960
TRAVIS: Is the captain looking fellow--

4129
03:13:28.960 --> 03:13:31.620
does he have a (whistling) huge hat as well?

4130
03:13:31.620 --> 03:13:32.703
MATT: No.

4131
03:13:32.703 --> 03:13:33.981
TRAVIS: Fuck.

4132
03:13:33.981 --> 03:13:36.853
[laughter]

4133
03:13:36.853 --> 03:13:39.537
Captain Deremi, I presume!

4134
03:13:40.926 --> 03:13:43.128
MATT: "And who's asking?"

4135
03:13:43.128 --> 03:13:45.043
TRAVIS: Captain Tusktooth. (clicks tongue)

4136
03:13:45.043 --> 03:13:48.618
[cheering]

4137
03:13:49.706 --> 03:13:53.644
MATT: "That's a fine hat ya got there, Captain Tusktooth."

4138
03:13:53.644 --> 03:13:56.252
TRAVIS: Yes, where is yours?

4139
03:13:56.252 --> 03:13:58.675
[laughter]

4140
03:13:58.675 --> 03:14:01.636
MATT: "I left it with me mum when I was 14."

4141
03:14:01.636 --> 03:14:05.636
[groans of sympathy]

4142
03:14:05.636 --> 03:14:07.234
MATT: The other dwarf goes like,

4143
03:14:07.234 --> 03:14:09.768
"Ah, don't bother him as much, he's fine.

4144
03:14:09.768 --> 03:14:12.160
"It's a nice hat. I like it."

4145
03:14:12.160 --> 03:14:13.280
TRAVIS: Thank you.

4146
03:14:13.280 --> 03:14:15.120
It was a gift.

4147
03:14:16.090 --> 03:14:19.700
I've just been admiring the Blue Heaven out in the docks.

4148
03:14:19.700 --> 03:14:22.270
Absolutely magnificent vessel.

4149
03:14:22.270 --> 03:14:24.112
MATT: (as Deremi) "Why, thank you."

4150
03:14:24.112 --> 03:14:26.910
TRAVIS: I'm sure you've seen a truly impressive ship

4151
03:14:26.910 --> 03:14:28.480
out there as well, the Balleater.

4152
03:14:28.480 --> 03:14:30.075
I'm sure you've noticed it.

4153
03:14:30.075 --> 03:14:32.135
[laughter]

4154
03:14:32.135 --> 03:14:35.726
MATT: "I can't say I have. A curious name nonetheless."

4155
03:14:35.726 --> 03:14:36.861
TRAVIS: Oh!

4156
03:14:39.153 --> 03:14:40.516
Well, you know--

4157
03:14:40.516 --> 03:14:42.974
MATT: (as other dwarf) "(chuckling) Balleater."

4158
03:14:42.974 --> 03:14:45.583
[laughter]

4159
03:14:45.583 --> 03:14:47.341
"I love it, actually.

4160
03:14:47.341 --> 03:14:51.883
"It's unique. You should name your
ship something funny, hey asshole?"

4161
03:14:51.883 --> 03:14:53.634
LAURA: (laughs)

4162
03:14:53.634 --> 03:14:56.226
TRAVIS: Yes. It's funny. (clears throat)

4163
03:14:57.373 --> 03:15:00.273
I was just wondering if you were expecting any sort of

4164
03:15:00.273 --> 03:15:01.650
resistance or challenges

4165
03:15:01.650 --> 03:15:03.890
as you make your way out in a few days.

4166
03:15:03.890 --> 03:15:05.098
MATT: (as Deremi) "Well, I certainly hope not.

4167
03:15:05.098 --> 03:15:05.960
"We've come prepared.

4168
03:15:05.960 --> 03:15:07.470
"Our cannons are ready and loaded.

4169
03:15:07.470 --> 03:15:10.137
"We've got numerous ships at our sides.

4170
03:15:11.290 --> 03:15:14.206
"Waters are ours, so woe be unto those

4171
03:15:14.206 --> 03:15:17.290
"who try and step in front."

4172
03:15:17.290 --> 03:15:18.720
TRAVIS: It's very impressive.

4173
03:15:18.720 --> 03:15:20.940
Is your duty to safeguard

4174
03:15:22.280 --> 03:15:25.020
the item or are you just providing firepower?

4175
03:15:26.830 --> 03:15:28.130
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

4176
03:15:31.510 --> 03:15:32.610
TRAVIS: 14.

4177
03:15:32.610 --> 03:15:34.260
LAURA: That's not bad, that's not bad.

4178
03:15:35.220 --> 03:15:36.797
MATT: One eye twitches a little bit.

4179
03:15:36.797 --> 03:15:41.520
He goes, "That's a curious question."

4180
03:15:41.520 --> 03:15:44.110
TRAVIS: I'm sorry to speak so frankly, it's just,

4181
03:15:45.450 --> 03:15:48.210
we've been tasked with a very important

4182
03:15:48.210 --> 03:15:49.543
responsibility ourselves,

4183
03:15:49.543 --> 03:15:51.277
and I was just curious where we should turn

4184
03:15:51.277 --> 03:15:53.969
in times of unexpected peril.

4185
03:15:57.530 --> 03:15:59.346
MATT: "Just stay behind the gun ships.

4186
03:15:59.346 --> 03:16:00.997
"I think you'll be okay.

4187
03:16:00.997 --> 03:16:04.570
"We're bringing along important individuals."

4188
03:16:04.570 --> 03:16:06.000
TRAVIS: I see.

4189
03:16:06.000 --> 03:16:08.958
MATT: "Those are helming the negotiation."

4190
03:16:08.958 --> 03:16:10.291
TRAVIS: Ah, very well.

4191
03:16:11.280 --> 03:16:13.030
Well, if we can be of any service

4192
03:16:13.030 --> 03:16:16.300
before we disembark, please don't hesitate to ask.

4193
03:16:16.300 --> 03:16:17.980
I know our vessel is unassuming,

4194
03:16:17.980 --> 03:16:21.040
but we're quite capable.

4195
03:16:21.040 --> 03:16:22.410
MATT: "I appreciate the offer.

4196
03:16:22.410 --> 03:16:24.730
"Should things turn sour,

4197
03:16:24.730 --> 03:16:29.409
"I'll gladly send up the flag if to summon the Balleater."

4198
03:16:29.409 --> 03:16:32.409
[laughter]

4199
03:16:33.740 --> 03:16:37.639
TRAVIS: The Balleater is at your disposal, sir.

4200
03:16:37.639 --> 03:16:40.689
(laughter)

4201
03:16:40.689 --> 03:16:43.466
MATT: "Then I'm guessing we'd best be getting hungry."

4202
03:16:43.466 --> 03:16:46.466
[laughter]

4203
03:16:48.120 --> 03:16:50.578
(as the other dwarf) "Shut up, you're such an asshole.

4204
03:16:50.578 --> 03:16:51.600
"Don't worry about him;

4205
03:16:51.600 --> 03:16:52.940
"he's fucking prick."

4206
03:16:52.940 --> 03:16:54.148
TRAVIS: Oh, he's earned it.

4207
03:16:54.148 --> 03:16:56.220
His reputation is sterling.

4208
03:16:56.220 --> 03:16:57.920
I'll take my leave now, thank you.

4209
03:16:59.570 --> 03:17:01.153
MATT: "No wonder you don't have any friends."

4210
03:17:01.153 --> 03:17:03.300
And they argue a bit as you leave away.

4211
03:17:03.300 --> 03:17:07.345
TRAVIS: I just hold my hat for the rest of the party.

4212
03:17:07.345 --> 03:17:08.803
MATT: Aww.
ASHLEY: Oh no!

4213
03:17:08.803 --> 03:17:11.640
LIAM: Is the Martinet floating about?

4214
03:17:11.640 --> 03:17:12.940
MATT: Yes.

4215
03:17:12.940 --> 03:17:14.790
LIAM: I am going to go over and chat him up.

4216
03:17:15.750 --> 03:17:16.830
MATT: All right.

4217
03:17:16.830 --> 03:17:17.888
As you approach.

4218
03:17:19.140 --> 03:17:23.108
"Ah, Mr. Widogast, good to see you."

4219
03:17:23.108 --> 03:17:25.600
LIAM: Good evening, good evening.

4220
03:17:28.030 --> 03:17:30.860
MATT: "The performance should be beginning shortly."

4221
03:17:30.860 --> 03:17:33.268
LIAM: Well, I'll be brief.

4222
03:17:33.268 --> 03:17:35.993
We are about to embark on a

4223
03:17:35.993 --> 03:17:39.076
quite an historic undertaking.

4224
03:17:39.076 --> 03:17:39.909
MATT: "Right."

4225
03:17:41.768 --> 03:17:45.918
LIAM: I'm wondering, we are within reach

4226
03:17:45.918 --> 03:17:49.360
of a possible end to this conflict.

4227
03:17:49.360 --> 03:17:50.943
Cheers.

4228
03:17:50.943 --> 03:17:52.360
MATT: "Cheers to that."

4229
03:17:56.600 --> 03:18:00.550
LIAM: It will be good to finish this war.

4230
03:18:01.490 --> 03:18:03.323
MATT: "Indeed it will be."

4231
03:18:03.323 --> 03:18:04.573
LIAM: I commend you

4232
03:18:05.930 --> 03:18:08.388
on seeing the reason

4233
03:18:08.388 --> 03:18:12.529
in cooperation and negotiation.

4234
03:18:13.378 --> 03:18:16.602
MATT: "I believe it is important to stem the tide

4235
03:18:16.602 --> 03:18:20.609
"of lives lost and to instead focus

4236
03:18:20.609 --> 03:18:24.934
"on the livelihood of those within the Empire

4237
03:18:24.934 --> 03:18:28.434
"and for us to pursue more important things

4238
03:18:30.435 --> 03:18:33.750
"than base conflict and disagreements."

4239
03:18:33.750 --> 03:18:35.000
LIAM: I couldn't agree more.

4240
03:18:36.540 --> 03:18:39.850
The Empire, we all love the Empire.

4241
03:18:41.418 --> 03:18:44.516
MATT: "To an extent," and he gives you a keen look.

4242
03:18:48.950 --> 03:18:50.940
LIAM: How much have you spoken to my

4243
03:18:53.160 --> 03:18:57.400
master about me, I wonder?

4244
03:18:57.400 --> 03:19:00.040
MATT: "I assume you're referring to Mr. Ikithon."

4245
03:19:00.040 --> 03:19:00.873
LIAM: Of course.

4246
03:19:02.550 --> 03:19:04.508
MATT: "Only a little bit.

4247
03:19:04.508 --> 03:19:06.925
"He briefed me on your history,

4248
03:19:08.440 --> 03:19:10.850
"and I must say,

4249
03:19:12.463 --> 03:19:17.138
"it is rather impressive to see
someone who has gone through,

4250
03:19:17.138 --> 03:19:21.221
"escaped and shucked the chains of the Volstrucker

4251
03:19:22.140 --> 03:19:26.296
"and returned, as you have with your friends.

4252
03:19:26.296 --> 03:19:30.725
LIAM: Well, I am a disappointment to my teacher, I am sure.

4253
03:19:30.725 --> 03:19:32.466
As well as many of my peers.

4254
03:19:32.466 --> 03:19:35.041
MATT: "Your teacher's a disappointment to many others."

4255
03:19:35.041 --> 03:19:37.466
[oohing]

4256
03:19:37.466 --> 03:19:41.549
[applause and cheering]

4257
03:19:42.763 --> 03:19:45.532
"He has his uses, but...

4258
03:19:48.140 --> 03:19:51.799
"Ah. People are complicated, are they not?"

4259
03:19:53.202 --> 03:19:54.860
LIAM: That they are.

4260
03:19:57.460 --> 03:20:00.420
How much do you know about his teaching methods, I wonder?

4261
03:20:00.420 --> 03:20:02.570
MATT: "Quite a bit.

4262
03:20:07.200 --> 03:20:09.990
"He put forth his designs and they were approved

4263
03:20:09.990 --> 03:20:13.770
"by the assembly when they first began developing

4264
03:20:13.770 --> 03:20:15.370
"the program for the Volstrucker.

4265
03:20:18.905 --> 03:20:22.071
"Although the extent of these things were not entirely

4266
03:20:22.071 --> 03:20:25.430
"part of the initial presentation,

4267
03:20:25.430 --> 03:20:29.271
"I understand that sometimes, desperate

4268
03:20:30.877 --> 03:20:35.877
"requirements might call for unsavory methods."

4269
03:20:36.130 --> 03:20:38.560
LIAM: You are fully aware of these methods now.

4270
03:20:38.560 --> 03:20:40.110
Is that what you're telling me?

4271
03:20:41.500 --> 03:20:42.708
MATT: "I believe so."

4272
03:20:45.502 --> 03:20:46.944
LIAM: The program goes on.

4273
03:20:49.150 --> 03:20:51.000
MATT: "The program has changed many times."

4274
03:20:57.205 --> 03:21:00.747
LIAM: Are you alone on the ship?

4275
03:21:02.890 --> 03:21:05.776
Trent is not accompanying, or any of his protégés?

4276
03:21:05.776 --> 03:21:08.558
MATT: "No, he thankfully has no interest

4277
03:21:08.558 --> 03:21:11.450
"in such political endeavors,

4278
03:21:11.450 --> 03:21:14.130
"and he would be--" He looks around the party.

4279
03:21:15.540 --> 03:21:20.480
"Let's just say a terrible guest
in this social environment."

4280
03:21:26.870 --> 03:21:28.578
LIAM: I don't think he would agree with me,

4281
03:21:28.578 --> 03:21:30.578
but I am a patriot, sir,

4282
03:21:33.120 --> 03:21:36.760
for this country, and I dearly hope

4283
03:21:38.000 --> 03:21:40.950
for a true end to this conflict.

4284
03:21:43.940 --> 03:21:45.420
MATT: "Well, you're on the right path."

4285
03:21:50.007 --> 03:21:53.020
LIAM: Do you think we could say goodbye to this hardship

4286
03:21:54.320 --> 03:21:55.170
in the next weeks?

4287
03:21:57.040 --> 03:21:58.457
MATT: "I think we can."

4288
03:21:59.381 --> 03:22:01.039
LIAM: Insight check.

4289
03:22:01.039 --> 03:22:02.447
MATT: Make an insight check.

4290
03:22:02.447 --> 03:22:04.697
(laughs)

4291
03:22:10.928 --> 03:22:11.761
LIAM: 12.

4292
03:22:14.250 --> 03:22:18.190
MATT: He is a stoic individual
who chooses his words carefully,

4293
03:22:18.190 --> 03:22:21.820
eloquently, and in doing so, manages to maintain

4294
03:22:21.820 --> 03:22:24.920
a barrier that you cannot read past.

4295
03:22:24.920 --> 03:22:28.860
Nothing about it seems insincere, but who knows?

4296
03:22:28.860 --> 03:22:30.720
You've been around people like this before.

4297
03:22:32.210 --> 03:22:36.460
LIAM: My father and mother died for this country, ours.

4298
03:22:38.528 --> 03:22:40.695
Many have, many more will.

4299
03:22:44.340 --> 03:22:45.940
I hope your intentions are true.

4300
03:22:47.900 --> 03:22:51.817
That's very much why my friends and I are here.

4301
03:22:56.089 --> 03:22:56.922
MATT: "Well then,

4302
03:22:58.988 --> 03:23:00.605
"best of luck on the travel ahead."

4303
03:23:04.610 --> 03:23:08.810
LIAM: I am looking forward to the journey together.

4304
03:23:15.240 --> 03:23:16.073
Enjoy the party.

4305
03:23:17.210 --> 03:23:18.377
MATT: "You as well."

4306
03:23:20.435 --> 03:23:24.270
While this is happening, you are under the table.

4307
03:23:24.270 --> 03:23:26.353
Dezran is saying nothing.

4308
03:23:26.353 --> 03:23:28.130
Dezran is backed up against the table

4309
03:23:28.130 --> 03:23:30.180
you're hiding under, invisible,

4310
03:23:30.180 --> 03:23:33.067
and is barely even drinking the drink that he has

4311
03:23:33.067 --> 03:23:35.900
and is looking about nervously.

4312
03:23:35.900 --> 03:23:39.155
LAURA: I'm going to go up to Dezran.

4313
03:23:39.155 --> 03:23:42.955
MATT: "Ah, ha, you are one of the--"

4314
03:23:43.965 --> 03:23:45.748
LAURA: Mighty Nein, I met you yesterday!

4315
03:23:45.748 --> 03:23:48.742
MATT: "Mighty Nein, yes, introduced yesterday."

4316
03:23:48.742 --> 03:23:51.053
LAURA: You're a lord here?
MATT: "What, what, what?"

4317
03:23:51.053 --> 03:23:52.740
LAURA: You're a Lord here in town?

4318
03:23:52.740 --> 03:23:54.183
MATT: "Yes, I am."

4319
03:23:54.183 --> 03:23:56.311
LAURA: Where do you live?

4320
03:23:56.311 --> 03:23:57.537
MATT: "Around."

4321
03:23:57.537 --> 03:24:01.356
[laughter]

4322
03:24:01.356 --> 03:24:03.046
LAURA: Around here?

4323
03:24:03.046 --> 03:24:04.680
MATT: "Yes."
LAURA: The Marquis?

4324
03:24:04.680 --> 03:24:08.082
MATT: "Well, not be here specifically, but

4325
03:24:08.082 --> 03:24:11.265
"I move after I travel.

4326
03:24:11.265 --> 03:24:12.714
"It gets boring.

4327
03:24:12.714 --> 03:24:14.106
"I'm so sorry, I'm not feeling well.

4328
03:24:14.106 --> 03:24:16.815
"I should probably get going."
LAURA: Oh, do you have stomach issues?

4329
03:24:16.815 --> 03:24:17.880
MATT: "Terribly, yes."

4330
03:24:17.880 --> 03:24:20.760
LAURA: Oh no, but you can't leave.

4331
03:24:20.760 --> 03:24:22.260
MATT: "Ah, but I must."

4332
03:24:22.260 --> 03:24:23.830
LAURA: But my momma's about to perform.

4333
03:24:23.830 --> 03:24:26.410
Have you ever been to the Lavish Chateau?

4334
03:24:26.410 --> 03:24:27.428
MATT: "No."

4335
03:24:27.428 --> 03:24:30.420
LAURA: She is one of the most famous performers ever.

4336
03:24:30.420 --> 03:24:31.711
You know, I can help heal you

4337
03:24:31.711 --> 03:24:33.403
if you have stomach issues. I'm a cleric.

4338
03:24:34.545 --> 03:24:39.394
That way you don't have to go anywhere, you know?

4339
03:24:39.394 --> 03:24:41.450
MATT: "I will happily stay for the performance."

4340
03:24:41.450 --> 03:24:44.010
LAURA: Oh, wonderful. I link my arm in his.

4341
03:24:45.410 --> 03:24:46.910
Does it feel like

4342
03:24:47.870 --> 03:24:50.470
his clothes feel different than what I'm touching?

4343
03:24:50.470 --> 03:24:51.303
Does everything feel normal?

4344
03:24:51.303 --> 03:24:52.136
MATT: It's hard to tell. It's material.

4345
03:24:52.136 --> 03:24:53.431
LAURA: Okay.

4346
03:24:53.431 --> 03:24:55.687
MATT: It's not so much he's wearing
a whole different dimension of an outfit,

4347
03:24:55.687 --> 03:24:57.810
it's the coloration's mostly different

4348
03:24:57.810 --> 03:24:59.850
and what dimensions would be slightly different,

4349
03:24:59.850 --> 03:25:00.930
don't really show through the illusion.

4350
03:25:00.930 --> 03:25:03.540
It's meant to be close to what he's actually presenting.

4351
03:25:03.540 --> 03:25:05.956
LAURA: Okay, I think she's performing over here.

4352
03:25:05.956 --> 03:25:07.647
Oh my gosh, I can't believe you live here

4353
03:25:07.647 --> 03:25:10.120
and you've never come to see her, she's amazing.

4354
03:25:10.120 --> 03:25:13.860
MATT: "I am what you would refer to as an introvert."

4355
03:25:13.860 --> 03:25:16.617
LAURA: She is too, It's surprising, I know,

4356
03:25:16.617 --> 03:25:18.420
because she's so outgoing and everything,

4357
03:25:18.420 --> 03:25:20.510
but she likes to stay at home. Do you?

4358
03:25:20.510 --> 03:25:21.793
MATT: "Ah...

4359
03:25:23.510 --> 03:25:24.351
"yes,"

4360
03:25:24.351 --> 03:25:26.952
and begins to drink the wine.

4361
03:25:28.055 --> 03:25:31.592
At which point, as you're following and listening in,

4362
03:25:33.050 --> 03:25:35.020
there is an announcement.

4363
03:25:35.020 --> 03:25:37.853
Everyone gives a round of claps

4364
03:25:37.853 --> 03:25:38.975
and the music begins.

4365
03:25:38.975 --> 03:25:42.430
Some of the performers, their violins begin to kick in

4366
03:25:42.430 --> 03:25:46.190
and Marion descends the curved stairway

4367
03:25:46.190 --> 03:25:49.010
that spirals around the interior.

4368
03:25:49.010 --> 03:25:52.010
SAM: As she approaches and focus is pulled,

4369
03:25:52.010 --> 03:25:52.843
I'm going to,

4370
03:25:54.230 --> 03:25:57.330
very subtly and stealthily,

4371
03:25:57.330 --> 03:26:01.330
try to drop a vial of liquid into Essek's drink.

4372
03:26:02.802 --> 03:26:04.861
[murmuring]

4373
03:26:04.861 --> 03:26:08.500
SAM: Many months ago we recovered a vial of paralysis

4374
03:26:08.500 --> 03:26:10.320
from a monster.

4375
03:26:10.320 --> 03:26:12.490
I don't remember what the monster was,

4376
03:26:14.350 --> 03:26:18.686
but we got some paralyzing stuff.

4377
03:26:18.686 --> 03:26:19.960
(laughter)

4378
03:26:19.960 --> 03:26:22.626
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check with advantage.

4379
03:26:22.626 --> 03:26:25.626
[cheering]

4380
03:26:27.000 --> 03:26:27.833
SAM: 30.

4381
03:26:27.833 --> 03:26:30.833
[laughter]

4382
03:26:32.775 --> 03:26:34.369
LAURA: What are we going to do with him once he's paralyzed?

4383
03:26:34.369 --> 03:26:36.540
SAM: I don't know, I don't know.

4384
03:26:36.540 --> 03:26:39.662
MATT: All this shit coming back
to bite me in the ass, all right.

4385
03:26:39.662 --> 03:26:41.462
TALIESIN: Oh no.
LAURA: What are we going to do?

4386
03:26:41.462 --> 03:26:46.094
MATT: Okay, Marion's voice begins to carry beautifully

4387
03:26:46.094 --> 03:26:47.961
throughout the night air

4388
03:26:47.961 --> 03:26:50.769
singing entirely a song in Zemnian,

4389
03:26:50.769 --> 03:26:52.541
though she does not know the language.

4390
03:26:52.541 --> 03:26:55.982
She has learned this song as a way to

4391
03:26:55.982 --> 03:26:57.960
present and bring in all the different

4392
03:26:57.960 --> 03:27:00.602
dignitaries of the Dwendalian Empire

4393
03:27:00.602 --> 03:27:02.801
that are here visiting before they set out to sea.

4394
03:27:02.801 --> 03:27:04.609
It is gorgeous.

4395
03:27:04.609 --> 03:27:06.552
And you've seen her perform a number of times,

4396
03:27:06.552 --> 03:27:09.820
but each time is a fresh, entrancing experience

4397
03:27:09.820 --> 03:27:12.520
as her voice seems to carry with this clarity

4398
03:27:13.590 --> 03:27:18.040
and this sense of almost magical melody behind it

4399
03:27:18.040 --> 03:27:21.023
that you know why she has, once again, established herself

4400
03:27:21.023 --> 03:27:24.920
as one of the foremost performers in the Menagerie Coast.

4401
03:27:24.920 --> 03:27:27.445
The people are entranced and watching.

4402
03:27:27.445 --> 03:27:29.310
Essek drinks of his drink.

4403
03:27:29.310 --> 03:27:31.277
LAURA: Lord Thain, do you speak Zemnian?

4404
03:27:32.790 --> 03:27:35.814
MATT: "I do not, myself,

4405
03:27:35.814 --> 03:27:39.302
"as I have not visited the Empire."

4406
03:27:39.302 --> 03:27:41.502
LAURA: Oh. Wait, what?

4407
03:27:41.502 --> 03:27:44.402
Oh, you've never been to the Empire?

4408
03:27:44.402 --> 03:27:45.473
MATT: "No."

4409
03:27:45.473 --> 03:27:47.640
LAURA: But we always travel to the Empire.

4410
03:27:47.640 --> 03:27:48.925
I mean, it's so common.

4411
03:27:49.860 --> 03:27:51.647
MATT: "Not-- I don't go out very often."

4412
03:27:51.647 --> 03:27:52.480
LAURA: Oh, right.

4413
03:27:52.480 --> 03:27:54.120
MATT: What's the DC on it?

4414
03:27:54.120 --> 03:27:56.612
SAM: Oh boy. I didn't write that down.

4415
03:27:56.612 --> 03:27:57.445
MATT: Okay.

4416
03:27:58.279 --> 03:27:59.779
Okay, we'll say...

4417
03:28:02.953 --> 03:28:04.986
SAM: I forget what monster was, but--

4418
03:28:04.986 --> 03:28:07.223
MATT: We'll say it's a 12.
SAM: Okay.

4419
03:28:07.223 --> 03:28:08.723
MATT: Constitution save.
SAM: Great.

4420
03:28:11.467 --> 03:28:14.467
[laughter]

4421
03:28:17.965 --> 03:28:19.632
LAURA: What did you roll?

4422
03:28:20.957 --> 03:28:22.423
MATT: So that's a six.

4423
03:28:22.423 --> 03:28:25.423
[laughter]

4424
03:28:27.910 --> 03:28:29.460
LAURA: You really should get out more.

4425
03:28:29.460 --> 03:28:32.405
I mean, I know it's hard a lot of times.

4426
03:28:32.405 --> 03:28:34.563
MATT: (stifled groaning)

4427
03:28:34.563 --> 03:28:36.646
LAURA: Lord Thain, are you okay?

4428
03:28:37.657 --> 03:28:38.590
MATT: (stifled groaning)

4429
03:28:38.590 --> 03:28:39.923
LAURA: What's going on?

4430
03:28:41.499 --> 03:28:43.132
Lord Thain?

4431
03:28:43.132 --> 03:28:44.632
Is it your stomach?

4432
03:28:45.712 --> 03:28:47.021
Did I see Nott?

4433
03:28:47.021 --> 03:28:49.679
MATT: No, no, Nott's invisible and rolled a 30.

4434
03:28:49.679 --> 03:28:51.107
Nobody could have seen Nott.

4435
03:28:51.107 --> 03:28:51.940
[laughter]

4436
03:28:51.940 --> 03:28:55.030
MATT: Beyond the eyes of the gods behind the Divine Gate.

4437
03:28:56.490 --> 03:29:00.131
They're watching Nott going, "Oh shit, how'd that happen?"

4438
03:29:01.273 --> 03:29:03.106
LAURA: Oh god, are you okay?

4439
03:29:05.047 --> 03:29:07.255
ASHLEY: I'm going to float near there

4440
03:29:07.255 --> 03:29:08.977
just to keep an eye on Jester.

4441
03:29:08.977 --> 03:29:10.935
LAURA: I'm going to rub his belly.

4442
03:29:10.935 --> 03:29:12.860
Is it your stomach, is it your stomach?

4443
03:29:12.860 --> 03:29:14.270
MATT: Other people are looking over.

4444
03:29:14.270 --> 03:29:17.282
LAURA: I mean, (whispering) I'm going to keep it down.

4445
03:29:17.282 --> 03:29:18.974
Pay attention to the song she's performing.

4446
03:29:18.974 --> 03:29:21.061
God, stop looking at me.

4447
03:29:21.061 --> 03:29:23.127
[laughter]

4448
03:29:23.127 --> 03:29:23.960
MATT: (stifled groaning)

4449
03:29:23.960 --> 03:29:27.089
LAURA: I'm going to try to pull him out of the room.

4450
03:29:27.089 --> 03:29:31.329
MATT: Okay. Weirdly enough, just kind of glides.

4451
03:29:31.329 --> 03:29:34.329
[laughter]

4452
03:29:38.870 --> 03:29:40.596
MATT: It's like when you're playing an MMO

4453
03:29:40.596 --> 03:29:41.429
and suddenly you get a lag spike

4454
03:29:41.429 --> 03:29:44.394
and your character just moves across the floor.

4455
03:29:44.394 --> 03:29:46.204
(laughter)

4456
03:29:46.204 --> 03:29:47.037
TALIESIN: I'm going to trail them.

4457
03:29:47.037 --> 03:29:49.155
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm going to trail as well.
TALIESIN: I've been watching all this.

4458
03:29:49.155 --> 03:29:49.997
MATT: All right.

4459
03:29:49.997 --> 03:29:53.523
The music is getting louder and people are enthralled

4460
03:29:53.523 --> 03:29:56.106
and as you guys are keeping an eye on this,

4461
03:29:56.106 --> 03:29:58.310
you can see Jester slowly dragging

4462
03:29:58.310 --> 03:30:02.376
a very mannequin-still Dezran.

4463
03:30:02.376 --> 03:30:05.286
LAURA: I don't know what happened.

4464
03:30:05.286 --> 03:30:06.119
ASHLEY: What's going on?

4465
03:30:06.119 --> 03:30:07.695
LIAM: I'm going to follow out.

4466
03:30:08.950 --> 03:30:11.025
MARISHA: I'm staying in.
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

4467
03:30:11.025 --> 03:30:13.500
MATT: It's noted.
SAM: I'm going to go with Jester behind her.

4468
03:30:13.500 --> 03:30:15.060
MATT: Okay.

4469
03:30:15.060 --> 03:30:17.440
Who else is going with Jester?

4470
03:30:17.440 --> 03:30:19.340
All right, so everybody but you two stay behind.

4471
03:30:19.340 --> 03:30:21.055
TRAVIS: Fuck yeah.
(hands clapping)

4472
03:30:21.055 --> 03:30:23.420
[laughter]

4473
03:30:23.420 --> 03:30:24.560
All righty.

4474
03:30:24.560 --> 03:30:27.008
LIAM: What are we doing here?

4475
03:30:27.008 --> 03:30:28.366
This is not exactly the plan that we talked about.

4476
03:30:28.366 --> 03:30:29.683
What are we doing?
LAURA: I don't know, I don't know.

4477
03:30:29.683 --> 03:30:30.607
LIAM: What did you do to him?

4478
03:30:30.607 --> 03:30:32.440
LAURA: I didn't do anything, I was just talking to--
SAM: Dee-dee-dee!

4479
03:30:32.440 --> 03:30:33.273
Hi.

4480
03:30:33.273 --> 03:30:34.563
LAURA: Oh, hi.

4481
03:30:34.563 --> 03:30:37.886
LIAM: Ah-ha.
SAM: He can hear us.

4482
03:30:37.886 --> 03:30:41.702
LAURA: I know it's just,
Lord Thain all of a sudden turned...

4483
03:30:41.702 --> 03:30:43.265
MATT: "(grunting)"
TALIESIN: That's very weird.

4484
03:30:43.265 --> 03:30:45.374
SAM: This gentleman has had some sort of a

4485
03:30:45.374 --> 03:30:47.007
seizure of some sort.

4486
03:30:47.007 --> 03:30:47.840
LAURA: Oh god.

4487
03:30:47.840 --> 03:30:49.132
SAM: We should do our best to--

4488
03:30:49.132 --> 03:30:51.752
LAURA: Should I cast, like, Greater Restoration on him?

4489
03:30:51.752 --> 03:30:54.268
SAM: Maybe, but let's try some other things first.

4490
03:30:54.268 --> 03:30:56.240
[laughter]

4491
03:30:56.240 --> 03:31:01.214
MATT: As you guys are dragging him
out of the party, his body--

4492
03:31:01.214 --> 03:31:03.464
LIAM: Why is he floating?

4493
03:31:03.464 --> 03:31:06.757
MATT: The muscles now come loose once more

4494
03:31:06.757 --> 03:31:07.590
as the paralysis--

4495
03:31:07.590 --> 03:31:08.548
LAURA: Are you okay?

4496
03:31:08.548 --> 03:31:11.381
Oh my gosh, you had me so worried.

4497
03:31:13.370 --> 03:31:15.732
MATT: "I have to go."

4498
03:31:15.732 --> 03:31:17.669
ASHLEY: Hold on a minute.
MATT: Pulls his arm out.

4499
03:31:17.669 --> 03:31:19.638
LIAM: I don't think so, click.

4500
03:31:19.638 --> 03:31:24.638
I put the Manacles of Stasis

4501
03:31:24.654 --> 03:31:25.837
on his wrists.

4502
03:31:25.837 --> 03:31:27.367
[cheering]

4503
03:31:27.367 --> 03:31:28.367
6th-level.

4504
03:31:32.790 --> 03:31:34.720
MATT: Go ahead and make an athletics check for me,

4505
03:31:34.720 --> 03:31:35.553
if you don't mind.

4506
03:31:35.553 --> 03:31:37.100
SAM: Oh boy.

4507
03:31:37.100 --> 03:31:38.558
LIAM: This should go well.

4508
03:31:38.558 --> 03:31:41.558
[laughter]

4509
03:31:43.760 --> 03:31:44.593
LIAM: 15.

4510
03:31:48.280 --> 03:31:49.495
MATT: It's a natural five.

4511
03:31:49.495 --> 03:31:54.170
[cheering]

4512
03:31:57.753 --> 03:31:59.279
MATT: "(sighs)"

4513
03:31:59.279 --> 03:32:04.177
[laughter]

4514
03:32:04.177 --> 03:32:05.135
(clicking)

4515
03:32:05.135 --> 03:32:07.218
They clack onto his wrists

4516
03:32:08.330 --> 03:32:10.663
and immediately he's,

4517
03:32:10.663 --> 03:32:13.913
"What are you doing, what are you doing?"

4518
03:32:15.230 --> 03:32:18.120
LIAM: Do I need to roll to see if he falls asleep?

4519
03:32:18.120 --> 03:32:19.380
LAURA: He falls asleep?

4520
03:32:19.380 --> 03:32:21.046
LIAM: That's what the Manacles of Stasis

4521
03:32:21.046 --> 03:32:23.854
from back in Lorenzo's basement do.

4522
03:32:23.854 --> 03:32:24.972
MATT: Oh, these aren't the...

4523
03:32:24.972 --> 03:32:27.525
LIAM: Manacles of Stasis.
MATT: Yes, you're right.

4524
03:32:27.525 --> 03:32:28.358
That's right.

4525
03:32:28.358 --> 03:32:31.749
LIAM: 6th-level, which means

4526
03:32:31.749 --> 03:32:35.049
15d8

4527
03:32:35.049 --> 03:32:36.490
against his HP.

4528
03:32:36.490 --> 03:32:40.073
MATT: So yes do you, have to roll a 15d8.

4529
03:32:41.073 --> 03:32:43.120
TALIESIN: What is happening?

4530
03:32:43.120 --> 03:32:46.120
[laughter]

4531
03:32:47.790 --> 03:32:50.707
MATT: I have to go look up his HP now, hold on a second.

4532
03:32:50.707 --> 03:32:51.899
TALIESIN: (cackles)

4533
03:32:51.899 --> 03:32:54.732
TRAVIS: What happened to just messaging Essek

4534
03:32:54.732 --> 03:32:56.420
and fucking prank calling him?

4535
03:32:56.420 --> 03:32:58.771
MATT: (yelling) Welcome to The Mighty Nein, Travis.

4536
03:32:58.771 --> 03:33:01.000
[laughter]

4537
03:33:01.000 --> 03:33:03.940
LAURA: I was just talking to him, I didn't do anything.

4538
03:33:05.950 --> 03:33:09.242
TRAVIS: Something happened in that bedroom, didn't it, Veth?

4539
03:33:09.242 --> 03:33:11.042
Something that came unhinged.

4540
03:33:11.042 --> 03:33:12.680
[laughter]

4541
03:33:12.680 --> 03:33:15.347
SAM: Everything feels different.

4542
03:33:18.859 --> 03:33:22.559
TRAVIS: That's a lot of numbers.
LIAM: That's 20.

4543
03:33:22.559 --> 03:33:24.544
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Go Liam! Woo!

4544
03:33:24.544 --> 03:33:26.866
[cheering]

4545
03:33:26.866 --> 03:33:28.324
LIAM: That's it.
LAURA: That's it?

4546
03:33:28.324 --> 03:33:30.492
LIAM: That's 73.

4547
03:33:33.385 --> 03:33:35.310
MATT: It's not enough.

4548
03:33:35.310 --> 03:33:37.400
[groaning]

4549
03:33:37.400 --> 03:33:39.066
TRAVIS: Okay.
MATT: Sorry.

4550
03:33:39.066 --> 03:33:42.014
SAM: Do they still hold his wrists?

4551
03:33:42.014 --> 03:33:43.540
MATT: Yeah, the medicals clap onto his wrists

4552
03:33:43.540 --> 03:33:46.373
and you watch him, like, almost stumble for a second,

4553
03:33:46.373 --> 03:33:51.140
the eyes lulling before he rights himself.

4554
03:33:51.140 --> 03:33:52.320
LAURA: Caleb, what are you doing?

4555
03:33:53.410 --> 03:33:54.540
LIAM: What are you doing?

4556
03:33:54.540 --> 03:33:55.590
LAURA: What are you talking about?

4557
03:33:55.590 --> 03:33:57.350
I was just talking to Lord Thain here.

4558
03:33:58.193 --> 03:33:59.280
MATT: (poofing)

4559
03:33:59.280 --> 03:34:01.640
He vanishes from the handcuffs and appears 30 feet away

4560
03:34:01.640 --> 03:34:04.430
on the outside of the gate of the establishment.

4561
03:34:04.430 --> 03:34:05.290
TALIESIN: 30 feet away?

4562
03:34:05.290 --> 03:34:06.140
MATT: Yes.

4563
03:34:06.140 --> 03:34:09.798
TALIESIN: I'm just going to say:

4564
03:34:09.798 --> 03:34:10.639
Stop!

4565
03:34:10.639 --> 03:34:11.981
I'm going to try Command.

4566
03:34:11.981 --> 03:34:13.372
(laughter)

4567
03:34:13.372 --> 03:34:16.322
TALIESIN: Stop.
SAM: Oh my god.

4568
03:34:16.322 --> 03:34:17.888
Oh my god.

4569
03:34:19.646 --> 03:34:21.212
It's a party now.

4570
03:34:22.510 --> 03:34:24.727
MATT: All right, the guards are there

4571
03:34:24.727 --> 03:34:25.560
and as you say, "Stop,"

4572
03:34:25.560 --> 03:34:27.693
they turn towards you as you shout and point.

4573
03:34:27.693 --> 03:34:28.543
TALIESIN: Stop!

4574
03:34:28.543 --> 03:34:29.457
MATT: All right.

4575
03:34:29.457 --> 03:34:30.656
Wisdom saving throw.

4576
03:34:30.656 --> 03:34:31.873
TALIESIN: 17.

4577
03:34:31.873 --> 03:34:33.388
MATT: 15.
TALIESIN: Cool.

4578
03:34:33.388 --> 03:34:35.638
(laughter)

4579
03:34:37.671 --> 03:34:38.504
SAM: It worked?

4580
03:34:38.504 --> 03:34:39.480
TALIESIN: Yeah.
LAURA: It worked.

4581
03:34:39.480 --> 03:34:41.030
TALIESIN: It doesn't work for a long time.

4582
03:34:41.030 --> 03:34:42.040
MATT: No, it lasts for a round,

4583
03:34:42.040 --> 03:34:43.350
so when it comes back to his next turn,

4584
03:34:43.350 --> 03:34:45.488
he's just going to not do anything.

4585
03:34:45.488 --> 03:34:49.429
TALIESIN: Yeah, so I'm going to head on over there.

4586
03:34:50.500 --> 03:34:52.050
MATT: All right, the guards look confused.

4587
03:34:52.050 --> 03:34:52.883
Are you guys falling Caduceus?

4588
03:34:52.883 --> 03:34:53.716
ASHLEY: Yeah.
LAURA: Sure, yeah, yeah.

4589
03:34:54.667 --> 03:34:56.490
TALIESIN: It's fine, we just have to finish a conversation.

4590
03:34:56.490 --> 03:34:57.710
LIAM: Sorry, our friend's had too much to drink.

4591
03:34:57.710 --> 03:34:59.480
TALIESIN: Yeah, just have a quick conversation.

4592
03:34:59.480 --> 03:35:02.426
MATT: All right, make a deception check.

4593
03:35:02.426 --> 03:35:03.259
SAM: Oh, Jesus.

4594
03:35:03.259 --> 03:35:05.342
MATT: Make a deception check.

4595
03:35:08.429 --> 03:35:09.545
TALIESIN: Where's my deception?

4596
03:35:09.545 --> 03:35:10.688
LIAM: 16 for me.
LAURA: All the while

4597
03:35:10.688 --> 03:35:12.194
my mother is singing.

4598
03:35:12.194 --> 03:35:13.638
TALIESIN: 20.

4599
03:35:13.638 --> 03:35:15.961
[cheering]

4600
03:35:15.961 --> 03:35:17.294
TALIESIN: I'm not lying.

4601
03:35:19.340 --> 03:35:21.230
MATT: It's less about the lying and more the intent

4602
03:35:21.230 --> 03:35:23.738
of what's going on, trying to keep it

4603
03:35:23.738 --> 03:35:25.450
from sounding like there's conflict going on,

4604
03:35:25.450 --> 03:35:29.608
which you seem to do as the guards just

4605
03:35:29.608 --> 03:35:33.380
nod and open the gate for you as you step by.

4606
03:35:33.380 --> 03:35:35.200
As Lord Dezran's just standing there going--

4607
03:35:35.200 --> 03:35:36.800
TALIESIN: You really do want to talk to us.

4608
03:35:36.800 --> 03:35:40.675
I think it's very important. You do.

4609
03:35:40.675 --> 03:35:42.466
LIAM: A lot at stake here.

4610
03:35:42.466 --> 03:35:43.299
TALIESIN: A lot.

4611
03:35:48.510 --> 03:35:50.430
MATT: "Fine, then show me where."

4612
03:35:50.430 --> 03:35:53.823
TALIESIN: Let's find a place to talk that's quiet.

4613
03:35:56.510 --> 03:35:58.915
MATT: While this is happening, what are you two doing?

4614
03:35:58.915 --> 03:36:02.470
[laughter]

4615
03:36:02.470 --> 03:36:04.722
TRAVIS: Watching the Ruby of the Sea!

4616
03:36:04.722 --> 03:36:07.722
[cheering]

4617
03:36:12.822 --> 03:36:14.247
She's incredible!

4618
03:36:14.247 --> 03:36:16.009
MARISHA: She's so good, dude.
TRAVIS: I'm telling you.

4619
03:36:16.009 --> 03:36:19.004
MARISHA: God, fuck.

4620
03:36:19.004 --> 03:36:20.215
[laughter]

4621
03:36:20.215 --> 03:36:21.950
TRAVIS: Just the sheer strength

4622
03:36:21.950 --> 03:36:25.104
to hold that position for that long.
MARISHA: No, it's insane.

4623
03:36:25.104 --> 03:36:27.034
And how long did it take her to do her makeup?

4624
03:36:27.034 --> 03:36:27.912
TRAVIS: I don't know!

4625
03:36:27.912 --> 03:36:30.600
MATT: What's wild, too is her voice is so powerful

4626
03:36:30.600 --> 03:36:33.080
that it's having an effect

4627
03:36:33.080 --> 03:36:35.640
on those strange ethereal fish creatures

4628
03:36:35.640 --> 03:36:37.390
as they're now, like, circling her

4629
03:36:37.390 --> 03:36:40.473
in this beautiful Ariel from The Little Mermaid

4630
03:36:40.473 --> 03:36:44.181
type dance, but only you can see it.

4631
03:36:44.181 --> 03:36:48.944
(laughter)

4632
03:36:48.944 --> 03:36:52.027
LAURA: (laughs)

4633
03:36:55.900 --> 03:36:59.457
MARISHA: You don't understand, man.
She's, like, one with the sea.

4634
03:36:59.457 --> 03:37:00.740
[laughter]

4635
03:37:00.740 --> 03:37:02.915
When they say she's the Ruby of the Sea,

4636
03:37:02.915 --> 03:37:05.481
they were, like, fucking literal.

4637
03:37:07.770 --> 03:37:09.404
MARISHA: This is very From Beyond right now.

4638
03:37:09.404 --> 03:37:12.404
(laughter)

4639
03:37:13.960 --> 03:37:15.110
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait.

4640
03:37:17.510 --> 03:37:20.025
My horniness is so distracting.

4641
03:37:20.025 --> 03:37:23.025
[laughter]

4642
03:37:25.075 --> 03:37:26.180
The dragonborn, the dragonborn.

4643
03:37:26.180 --> 03:37:28.105
TRAVIS: Oh yes.
MARISHA: Dwendalian guy.

4644
03:37:28.105 --> 03:37:30.938
TRAVIS: Yes, where is he?
MARISHA: He's got to be a mole, right?

4645
03:37:30.938 --> 03:37:32.499
TRAVIS: I don't know, maybe we should go check it out.

4646
03:37:32.499 --> 03:37:33.503
Should we press him for answers?

4647
03:37:33.503 --> 03:37:35.360
Should we act like we're part of a security detail?

4648
03:37:35.360 --> 03:37:37.755
MARISHA: Yeah, I think it's, like, man,

4649
03:37:37.755 --> 03:37:40.870
this job fucking you got to, like, be sober

4650
03:37:40.870 --> 03:37:42.410
while everyone else is drunk,

4651
03:37:42.410 --> 03:37:44.320
like, sucks, man, right?

4652
03:37:44.320 --> 03:37:45.410
TRAVIS: Are you okay?

4653
03:37:45.410 --> 03:37:48.873
MARISHA: No I don't know what Caduceus did to me, dude.

4654
03:37:48.873 --> 03:37:50.660
[laughter]

4655
03:37:50.660 --> 03:37:54.000
Caduceus, like, took me in an alleyway

4656
03:37:54.000 --> 03:37:59.000
and then told me that he was going to make me my best self.

4657
03:37:59.263 --> 03:38:02.263
[laughter]

4658
03:38:06.880 --> 03:38:09.138
TALIESIN: I assumed you could hold your shit, I'm so sorry.

4659
03:38:09.138 --> 03:38:11.388
(laughter)

4660
03:38:13.659 --> 03:38:14.492
Amateur.

4661
03:38:14.492 --> 03:38:16.520
TRAVIS: I mean, I just want to talk to this fellow.

4662
03:38:16.520 --> 03:38:19.025
You think you can manage?

4663
03:38:19.025 --> 03:38:20.760
[laughter]

4664
03:38:20.760 --> 03:38:23.400
MARISHA: Yeah, I can manage.

4665
03:38:23.400 --> 03:38:25.290
TRAVIS: Maybe I'll do the talking?

4666
03:38:25.290 --> 03:38:26.673
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll be your first mate.

4667
03:38:26.673 --> 03:38:28.965
I'll be, like, your yes man.

4668
03:38:28.965 --> 03:38:30.365
I'll just hype you, you know.

4669
03:38:30.365 --> 03:38:31.860
TRAVIS: We'll make our way over to the gentleman--

4670
03:38:31.860 --> 03:38:34.243
MARISHA: I can just, like, see

4671
03:38:34.243 --> 03:38:37.380
if he's, like, not pure heart

4672
03:38:37.380 --> 03:38:39.770
and if he's not connected,

4673
03:38:39.770 --> 03:38:44.450
so I'll just be there as, like, a bullshit meter, you know?

4674
03:38:44.450 --> 03:38:45.960
TRAVIS: Maybe you should stay here.

4675
03:38:45.960 --> 03:38:47.006
MARISHA: No.

4676
03:38:47.006 --> 03:38:50.230
(laughter)

4677
03:38:50.230 --> 03:38:51.063
TRAVIS: All right, let's go.

4678
03:38:51.063 --> 03:38:53.569
MARISHA: You need me.
TRAVIS: All right.

4679
03:38:53.569 --> 03:38:54.612
MARISHA: Let's go.

4680
03:38:56.170 --> 03:38:58.870
TRAVIS: We find the person.
MARISHA: Yeah, he's over there.

4681
03:38:58.870 --> 03:39:01.445
TRAVIS: All right, don't point.

4682
03:39:01.445 --> 03:39:03.875
(laughter)

4683
03:39:03.875 --> 03:39:05.677
MATT: You see him shoveling an hor d'oeuvres into his mouth

4684
03:39:05.677 --> 03:39:07.800
and, like, is not in the middle of a conversation

4685
03:39:07.800 --> 03:39:10.010
at the moment, is watching the performance, he goes.

4686
03:39:10.010 --> 03:39:11.450
TRAVIS: This is him?

4687
03:39:11.450 --> 03:39:12.658
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Okay.

4688
03:39:12.658 --> 03:39:13.980
MATT: Tall, tall gentleman.

4689
03:39:13.980 --> 03:39:16.938
TRAVIS: Hello, ha, greetings.

4690
03:39:16.938 --> 03:39:18.695
MATT: "Oh, hello to you."

4691
03:39:18.695 --> 03:39:20.343
TRAVIS: Captain Tusktooth, nice to meet you.

4692
03:39:20.343 --> 03:39:22.560
MATT: "I'm watching the performance, if you do not mind."

4693
03:39:22.560 --> 03:39:24.550
TRAVIS: Oh, no. I'm sorry.

4694
03:39:24.550 --> 03:39:26.508
She's amazing, is she not?

4695
03:39:26.508 --> 03:39:27.960
MATT: "It's very incredible."

4696
03:39:27.960 --> 03:39:28.793
MARISHA: So good.

4697
03:39:30.107 --> 03:39:31.700
[laughter]

4698
03:39:31.700 --> 03:39:33.533
TRAVIS: So how'd you get an invite to this party?

4699
03:39:33.533 --> 03:39:34.366
MATT: "Shh."

4700
03:39:39.136 --> 03:39:42.136
[laughter]

4701
03:39:46.380 --> 03:39:48.220
TRAVIS: You're sure that, okay.

4702
03:39:50.460 --> 03:39:54.225
I'm sorry, sir, you're going to need to come with us.

4703
03:39:54.225 --> 03:39:55.204
MARISHA: What?
MATT: "What?"

4704
03:39:55.204 --> 03:39:56.970
TRAVIS: We're part of a security detail at the Marquis.

4705
03:39:56.970 --> 03:39:58.450
I need you to come with me right now.

4706
03:39:58.450 --> 03:40:00.304
MATT: Make a deception check.

4707
03:40:00.304 --> 03:40:03.050
(laughter)

4708
03:40:03.050 --> 03:40:04.292
TRAVIS: 20.

4709
03:40:04.292 --> 03:40:07.292
[cheering]

4710
03:40:09.379 --> 03:40:10.690
LIAM: Face!

4711
03:40:10.690 --> 03:40:13.148
MATT: Like, mid second bite goes like--

4712
03:40:13.148 --> 03:40:15.525
TRAVIS: We're in disguise, don't mind the fucking hat.

4713
03:40:15.525 --> 03:40:17.525
MARISHA: You're in disguise, too.

4714
03:40:17.525 --> 03:40:21.100
Sorry, I can just-- I know.

4715
03:40:21.100 --> 03:40:23.020
MATT: Immediately the expression drops on his face.

4716
03:40:23.020 --> 03:40:27.238
He puts the half-eaten, small tart down and goes,

4717
03:40:27.238 --> 03:40:29.301
"I don't understand the problem,

4718
03:40:29.301 --> 03:40:30.208
"but of course."
MARISHA: We're cool, man.

4719
03:40:30.208 --> 03:40:31.258
TRAVIS: Just shut up, he's coming.

4720
03:40:31.258 --> 03:40:32.329
MARISHA: Okay.
TRAVIS: Come with us.

4721
03:40:32.329 --> 03:40:34.734
[laughter]

4722
03:40:34.734 --> 03:40:36.160
Go out to a hallway.

4723
03:40:36.160 --> 03:40:37.660
MATT: All right.

4724
03:40:37.660 --> 03:40:39.680
You guys are in the main courtyard area,

4725
03:40:39.680 --> 03:40:41.270
which is partially open with the glass ceiling,

4726
03:40:41.270 --> 03:40:42.728
that leads out into where the fountains are

4727
03:40:42.728 --> 03:40:44.260
in the open grass.

4728
03:40:44.260 --> 03:40:45.093
You can lead them out there,

4729
03:40:45.093 --> 03:40:47.051
you can lead him inside the house, if you want to.

4730
03:40:47.051 --> 03:40:48.366
It's up to you, there are guards posted.

4731
03:40:48.366 --> 03:40:50.291
TRAVIS: My friend here, Reau,

4732
03:40:50.291 --> 03:40:54.040
she can see everything about you

4733
03:40:54.040 --> 03:40:57.300
and through you, so be very honest.

4734
03:40:57.300 --> 03:41:00.050
Why are you pretending, my friend?

4735
03:41:01.140 --> 03:41:03.440
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

4736
03:41:03.440 --> 03:41:04.812
Or intimidation, should be intimidation.

4737
03:41:04.812 --> 03:41:06.287
MARISHA: With advantage, right?

4738
03:41:06.287 --> 03:41:07.856
MATT: This would be intimidation.
MARISHA: Because, like, I'm here.

4739
03:41:07.856 --> 03:41:08.934
TRAVIS: 28.

4740
03:41:08.934 --> 03:41:11.067
[cheering]

4741
03:41:11.067 --> 03:41:12.676
Natural 19.

4742
03:41:17.520 --> 03:41:18.948
It's the hat.

4743
03:41:18.948 --> 03:41:23.948
(laughter)

4744
03:41:24.264 --> 03:41:25.780
LIAM: Peacocking it.

4745
03:41:28.060 --> 03:41:30.550
MATT: "Look, I mean, there there's no issues.

4746
03:41:30.550 --> 03:41:32.140
"I mean, nothing wrong.

4747
03:41:32.140 --> 03:41:34.873
"I am hiding

03:41:38.320 --> 03:41:42.100

03:41:42.100 --> 03:41:46.280
"and not be discovered or found."

4751
03:41:46.280 --> 03:41:47.860
TRAVIS: Are you living here in Nicodranas?

4752
03:41:47.860 --> 03:41:49.800
MATT: "Yes, yes I am."

4753
03:41:49.800 --> 03:41:51.710
TRAVIS: Have you come to many of these parties before?

4754
03:41:51.710 --> 03:41:53.928
MATT: "No, it's only been a few recently.

4755
03:41:53.928 --> 03:41:56.232
"It's difficult to work your way
into such events like this."

4756
03:41:56.232 --> 03:41:57.346
TRAVIS: Insight check, please.

4757
03:41:57.346 --> 03:41:58.812
MATT: Make an insight check.

4758
03:42:00.970 --> 03:42:02.160
TRAVIS: Natural one.

4759
03:42:02.160 --> 03:42:04.660
[laughter]

4760
03:42:04.660 --> 03:42:05.493
MATT: Seems pretty honest.

4761
03:42:05.493 --> 03:42:07.299
TRAVIS: I believe you.

4762
03:42:07.299 --> 03:42:12.299
LIAM: (laughs)

4763
03:42:12.570 --> 03:42:14.920
TRAVIS: So, you're in hiding?

4764
03:42:14.920 --> 03:42:16.920
MATT: "Well, I'm just not wanting to call

4765
03:42:16.920 --> 03:42:18.140
"too much attention to me."

4766
03:42:18.140 --> 03:42:19.883
TRAVIS: Strange place to go

4767
03:42:19.883 --> 03:42:23.180
if you're not trying to gather attention.

4768
03:42:23.180 --> 03:42:24.990
MATT: "Well, you know, not gather attention,

4769
03:42:24.990 --> 03:42:27.848
"but also live it up a little?"

4770
03:42:27.848 --> 03:42:30.022
MARISHA: Mm.

4771
03:42:30.022 --> 03:42:31.997
TRAVIS: I'm going to confer with Reau,

4772
03:42:31.997 --> 03:42:35.693
my all-seeing lie.

4773
03:42:35.693 --> 03:42:37.567
MATT: "Of course, of course."

4774
03:42:37.567 --> 03:42:39.667
TRAVIS: What do you think?

4775
03:42:39.667 --> 03:42:42.342
Oh shit, do you need some water, orange juice?

4776
03:42:42.342 --> 03:42:44.540
[laughter]

4777
03:42:44.540 --> 03:42:45.373
MARISHA: Cotton mouth.

4778
03:42:46.570 --> 03:42:48.936
TRAVIS: Your jaw is going crazy, right now.

4779
03:42:48.936 --> 03:42:52.111
MARISHA: Am I doing that?

4780
03:42:52.111 --> 03:42:53.702
Yeah, I mean, he's clearly hiding something.

4781
03:42:53.702 --> 03:42:54.907
Why would he be here?

4782
03:42:54.907 --> 03:42:56.230
Why would he be in hiding?

4783
03:42:56.230 --> 03:42:57.080
TRAVIS: I don't know.

4784
03:42:57.080 --> 03:42:59.969
MARISHA: He's got to be like-- push harder.

4785
03:42:59.969 --> 03:43:00.802
Why are you in hiding?

4786
03:43:00.802 --> 03:43:01.862
TRAVIS: No, yeah, you do it, let's go.

4787
03:43:01.862 --> 03:43:03.012
MARISHA: Hey, why are you in hiding?

4788
03:43:03.012 --> 03:43:04.248
MATT: He's gone.

4789
03:43:04.248 --> 03:43:05.804
MARISHA: Fuck, he got away!

4790
03:43:05.804 --> 03:43:07.254
TRAVIS: I was looking at you!

4791
03:43:07.254 --> 03:43:08.585
MARISHA: I was looking at you, man!

4792
03:43:08.585 --> 03:43:09.994
TRAVIS: I turned to look at you.

4793
03:43:09.994 --> 03:43:12.366
You were supposed to look behind me when I look at you.

4794
03:43:12.366 --> 03:43:13.199
MARISHA: What?

4795
03:43:14.511 --> 03:43:15.587
Where is he?!

4796
03:43:15.587 --> 03:43:17.531
MATT: He rolled really high on his stealth check.

4797
03:43:17.531 --> 03:43:19.720
MARISHA: What?!
TRAVIS: Is he visible?

4798
03:43:19.720 --> 03:43:21.584
(laughter)

4799
03:43:21.584 --> 03:43:23.132
MATT: No, but one of the guards is looking at you

4800
03:43:23.132 --> 03:43:25.122
flail in the air and is like--

4801
03:43:25.122 --> 03:43:27.167
♪ The Ruby of the Sea ♪

4802
03:43:27.167 --> 03:43:30.167
[laughter]

4803
03:43:38.147 --> 03:43:39.897
♪ She's the one for me ♪

4804
03:43:41.570 --> 03:43:43.289
You know you want her too, don't lie.

4805
03:43:43.289 --> 03:43:44.702
What the fuck?

4806
03:43:44.702 --> 03:43:46.436
(laughter)

4807
03:43:46.436 --> 03:43:48.644
MARISHA: Uh, are we going to find this guy?

4808
03:43:48.644 --> 03:43:51.043
Is he a spy or is he just like--

4809
03:43:51.043 --> 03:43:52.544
TRAVIS: No, he's gone is what he is.

4810
03:43:52.544 --> 03:43:54.302
MARISHA: Goddamn it.

4811
03:43:57.035 --> 03:43:59.070
MATT: One of the little fishes comes by your face,

4812
03:43:59.070 --> 03:44:01.443
just barely moves past your nose.

4813
03:44:01.443 --> 03:44:02.317
MARISHA: (giggles)

4814
03:44:02.317 --> 03:44:03.556
TRAVIS: What are you doing?

4815
03:44:03.556 --> 03:44:06.556
[laughter]

4816
03:44:11.250 --> 03:44:13.710
MARISHA: This performance, man,

4817
03:44:13.710 --> 03:44:15.960
it's, like, artistic expression

4818
03:44:15.960 --> 03:44:18.870
in a way that I didn't know I could discover.

4819
03:44:18.870 --> 03:44:20.830
TRAVIS: We're not even in the room of the performance.

4820
03:44:20.830 --> 03:44:22.249
What is wrong with you?

4821
03:44:22.249 --> 03:44:23.100
[laughter]

4822
03:44:23.100 --> 03:44:24.960
Let's go back in so people don't think

4823
03:44:24.960 --> 03:44:26.301
you're tripping balls, let's go.

4824
03:44:26.301 --> 03:44:28.310
We go, I push her out.
MATT: All right.

4825
03:44:28.310 --> 03:44:32.643
LIAM: I speak through a wire towards Beauregard and say:

4826
03:44:33.551 --> 03:44:34.526
Are you frosty?

4827
03:44:34.526 --> 03:44:38.240
We are going to the Balleater. Come now.

4828
03:44:38.240 --> 03:44:40.906
MARISHA: Man, Marion Lavorre is so good.

4829
03:44:40.906 --> 03:44:42.400
TRAVIS: What?

4830
03:44:42.400 --> 03:44:44.108
MARISHA: She, like, talked to me just now

4831
03:44:44.108 --> 03:44:46.175
and she sounded like Caleb.

4832
03:44:46.175 --> 03:44:48.916
[laughter]

4833
03:44:48.916 --> 03:44:50.244
I don't know if it's part of the performance.

4834
03:44:50.244 --> 03:44:52.460
LIAM: Did Caleb hear the first part of that?

4835
03:44:52.460 --> 03:44:53.293
MATT: Yeah.

4836
03:44:54.727 --> 03:44:57.001
LIAM: Oh shit, she's high again.

4837
03:44:57.001 --> 03:44:59.962
[laughter]

4838
03:44:59.962 --> 03:45:02.028
LIAM: Fjord, we are going to the Balleater,

4839
03:45:02.028 --> 03:45:03.912
bring Beauregard quickly.

4840
03:45:03.912 --> 03:45:08.912
(laughter)

4841
03:45:08.964 --> 03:45:12.080
TALIESIN: (cackles)

4842
03:45:14.560 --> 03:45:18.045
TRAVIS: Did you start by hearing voices or seeing things?

4843
03:45:18.045 --> 03:45:20.295
(laughter)

4844
03:45:24.128 --> 03:45:26.193
MARISHA: Are you feeling it, too?
LIAM: Fjord, this is Caleb.

4845
03:45:26.193 --> 03:45:27.276
I heard that.

4846
03:45:27.276 --> 03:45:28.380
I am speaking to you.

4847
03:45:28.380 --> 03:45:29.463
I am Caleb.

4848
03:45:29.463 --> 03:45:31.963
You may reply to this message.

4849
03:45:32.800 --> 03:45:35.933
MARISHA: I think it's because, like, everything's connected.
TRAVIS: 10-4, no, Caleb, shut up.

4850
03:45:35.933 --> 03:45:36.766
We're coming.

4851
03:45:36.766 --> 03:45:37.599
Where are you?

4852
03:45:37.599 --> 03:45:40.143
Can you, oh shit.

4853
03:45:40.143 --> 03:45:43.250
No one sends me messages.

4854
03:45:43.250 --> 03:45:44.467
It's Caleb, we're supposed to go.

4855
03:45:44.467 --> 03:45:45.300
MARISHA: What?

4856
03:45:45.300 --> 03:45:46.650
TRAVIS: Yeah, they're not here.

4857
03:45:46.650 --> 03:45:48.530
MARISHA: Shit, where are they?

4858
03:45:51.870 --> 03:45:54.100
LIAM: It's good, I told Fjord, they're coming.

4859
03:45:54.100 --> 03:45:56.160
SAM: He told him a couple times, he got message.

4860
03:45:56.160 --> 03:45:58.430
TRAVIS: I'm pretty sure if we just wait one second,

4861
03:45:58.430 --> 03:46:00.047
we'll get one more.

4862
03:46:00.047 --> 03:46:02.210
MARISHA: Okay, okay, maybe they'll know.

4863
03:46:02.210 --> 03:46:03.660
SAM: All right, let's go.

4864
03:46:03.660 --> 03:46:06.736
MATT: About 15 minutes past without any response from Caleb.

4865
03:46:06.736 --> 03:46:08.453
[laughter]

4866
03:46:08.453 --> 03:46:09.845
TRAVIS: I feel like I missed something in the message.

4867
03:46:09.845 --> 03:46:10.719
Maybe we should just--

4868
03:46:10.719 --> 03:46:12.023
MARISHA: Oh, let's just go.
TRAVIS: Let's just go.

4869
03:46:12.023 --> 03:46:13.198
MARISHA: Okay, let's go.

4870
03:46:13.198 --> 03:46:15.540
MATT: Where are you guys going?

4871
03:46:15.540 --> 03:46:17.131
MARISHA: Um.

4872
03:46:20.063 --> 03:46:23.493
TRAVIS: They were dragging that guy that looked like Essek.

4873
03:46:23.493 --> 03:46:26.230
MARISHA: Okay, let's think like we were them.

4874
03:46:26.230 --> 03:46:28.230
TRAVIS: Oh, right, Jester took the guy up to the balcony.

4875
03:46:28.230 --> 03:46:29.838
so let's go up.

4876
03:46:29.838 --> 03:46:31.162
MARISHA: All right, let's go to the balcony.

4877
03:46:31.162 --> 03:46:31.995
TRAVIS: Okay.

4878
03:46:33.528 --> 03:46:34.701
MATT: All right.

4879
03:46:34.701 --> 03:46:37.350
You headed the balcony where...

4880
03:46:37.350 --> 03:46:38.199
All right, you head upstairs

4881
03:46:38.199 --> 03:46:39.157
and the balcony door doesn't open.

4882
03:46:39.157 --> 03:46:40.807
And you hear someone on the other side go like,

4883
03:46:40.807 --> 03:46:43.848
"Hey, please, could you help me?"
TRAVIS: Caleb?

4884
03:46:43.848 --> 03:46:45.014
MATT: "Yes."

4885
03:46:45.014 --> 03:46:46.168
[laughter]

4886
03:46:46.168 --> 03:46:48.690
MARISHA: Can I see through the wall?

4887
03:46:48.690 --> 03:46:50.460
With Truesight, can I see through the wall?

4888
03:46:50.460 --> 03:46:52.143
MATT: Truesight doesn't let you see through walls.

4889
03:46:52.143 --> 03:46:53.530
It's not, like, super x-ray,

4890
03:46:53.530 --> 03:46:54.907
I can see everything vision,

4891
03:46:54.907 --> 03:46:55.740
but you can see true forms.

4892
03:46:55.740 --> 03:46:57.965
You can see in the Ethereal Plane.

4893
03:46:57.965 --> 03:46:59.064
SAM: I guess.

4894
03:46:59.064 --> 03:47:00.405
TALIESIN: It's probably wearing off.

4895
03:47:00.405 --> 03:47:02.071
TRAVIS: I don't think that's Caleb.
I think we're in the wrong place.

4896
03:47:02.071 --> 03:47:03.560
MATT: The voice is definitely not Caleb.

4897
03:47:04.570 --> 03:47:05.403
TRAVIS: Fuck!

4898
03:47:06.700 --> 03:47:08.366
MARISHA: Okay.
TRAVIS: We should just leave.

4899
03:47:08.366 --> 03:47:09.580
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4900
03:47:09.580 --> 03:47:10.413
LAURA: Caleb, where are they?

4901
03:47:10.413 --> 03:47:11.630
You said they were coming.

4902
03:47:11.630 --> 03:47:13.590
TRAVIS: He did, Fjord said they were coming.

4903
03:47:13.590 --> 03:47:14.950
MARISHA: Let's go to the street.

4904
03:47:14.950 --> 03:47:16.198
TRAVIS: The street, all right.
LIAM: Too far away.

4905
03:47:16.198 --> 03:47:18.456
LAURA: Can we send them a message? I'll send them a message.

4906
03:47:18.456 --> 03:47:20.142
LIAM: Yeah, you.

4907
03:47:20.142 --> 03:47:22.127
LAURA: I'm going to send Fjord a message.

4908
03:47:22.127 --> 03:47:22.960
Fjord!

4909
03:47:22.960 --> 03:47:24.418
TRAVIS: We just go, hah, wait.

4910
03:47:24.418 --> 03:47:26.800
[laughter]

4911
03:47:26.800 --> 03:47:28.475
LAURA: What's taking you guys so long?

4912
03:47:28.475 --> 03:47:31.542
We're going to the Balleater, sheesh!

(laughter)

4917
03:47:49.379 --> 03:47:52.313
TRAVIS: It is so much weirder when you are in receipt

4918
03:47:52.313 --> 03:47:54.805
of one of those messages.

4919
03:47:54.805 --> 03:47:57.046
I honestly thought she was going to ask if I was pooping.

4920
03:47:57.046 --> 03:47:58.810
Did she hear all that?

4921
03:47:58.810 --> 03:47:59.643
[laughter]

4922
03:47:59.643 --> 03:48:01.530
MARISHA: I keep forgetting that they can hear us back.

4923
03:48:01.530 --> 03:48:03.196
TRAVIS: They're at the Balleater, let's go.

4924
03:48:03.196 --> 03:48:05.937
(laughter)

4925
03:48:05.937 --> 03:48:06.770

4927
03:48:15.895 --> 03:48:17.853
MARISHA: Nothing.

4928
03:48:17.853 --> 03:48:19.270
TRAVIS: Fucking worthless.

4929
03:48:23.566 --> 03:48:26.777
TALIESIN: This is the best 6th-level spell I've ever burned.

4930
03:48:26.777 --> 03:48:27.610
So good.

4931
03:48:29.470 --> 03:48:34.412
MATT: The rest of you, as you carefully escort

4932
03:48:35.595 --> 03:48:40.520
Lord Dezran Thain across the Restless Wharf,

4933
03:48:40.520 --> 03:48:41.910
eventually cross the gangplank

4934
03:48:41.910 --> 03:48:45.970
to the deck and below the deck of the Balleater.

4935
03:48:45.970 --> 03:48:48.040
You find your way to a comfortable space

4936
03:48:49.390 --> 03:48:52.560
away from prying eyes

4937
03:48:52.560 --> 03:48:57.170
and as the figure, shoulders slumped,

4938
03:48:57.170 --> 03:49:00.800
turns around the illusion fades.

03:49:00.800 --> 03:49:02.560

"you all weren't part of the plan."

LIAM: Well, you know, we have a limited amount of time

4951
03:49:50.390 --> 03:49:55.390

4952

4959
03:50:27.200 --> 03:50:28.891
Do you want to sit down?

MATT: "It may take as much,"

4963
03:50:38.728 --> 03:50:40.961
and he moves his hand this way and one of the crates

4964
03:50:40.961 --> 03:50:41.920
(scraping)

4965
03:50:41.920 --> 03:50:43.145

04:07:03.900 --> 04:07:06.262

5209
04:07:27.485 --> 04:07:30.735
MATT: "She's another member of the Assembly."

5211
04:07:35.585 --> 04:07:37.141
LIAM: DeRogna.

and now you're going to finish it.

5219
04:08:03.447 --> 04:08:04.280
MATT: "Yes."

5220
04:08:04.280 --> 04:08:06.640
SAM: And we're just supposed to turn the other way

5221
04:08:06.640 --> 04:08:11.640
and pretend like you're not all a bunch of traitors?

5222
04:08:11.867 --> 04:08:12.700
MATT: "Yes."

5223
04:08:15.171 --> 04:08:19.360
SAM: I mean, I like you, but the other ones,

5224
04:08:19.360 --> 04:08:21.970
we're just going to let them get away with it?

5225
04:08:21.970 --> 04:08:23.562
MATT: "They always have."

5226
04:08:25.500 --> 04:08:28.025
MARISHA: Thousands have died, Essek.

5227
04:08:31.120 --> 04:08:33.110
Thousands of innocents.

5228
04:08:38.596 --> 04:08:40.240
LIAM: And I know for a fact that one of the people

5229
04:08:40.240 --> 04:08:43.460
you have been negotiating with would throw you, me,

5230
04:08:43.460 --> 04:08:46.280
any one of us, any member of the country

5231
04:08:46.280 --> 04:08:49.860
he helps govern, into the fire.

5232
04:08:49.860 --> 04:08:51.276
Anyone.

5233
04:08:52.840 --> 04:08:56.490
I think your intentions are good, but I think, perhaps,

5234
04:08:57.390 --> 04:09:00.050
your vision has been clouded.

5235
04:09:00.050 --> 04:09:03.532
MATT: "My intentions were never good, they were important."

5236
04:09:05.010 --> 04:09:09.218

TALIESIN: (sighs)

5242
04:09:23.559 --> 04:09:24.392
LIAM: So.

5243
04:09:28.330 --> 04:09:32.030
Let's talk about what we are going to do next.

5244
04:09:32.030 --> 04:09:35.580
Obviously, this plan needs to move forward.

5245
04:09:35.580 --> 04:09:36.670
TRAVIS: Yes.

5246
04:09:36.670 --> 04:09:37.748
MATT: "Optimally, yes."

5247
04:09:37.748 --> 04:09:38.762
LIAM: Yeah.

5248
04:09:38.762 --> 04:09:40.770
LAURA: You're not going to betray us again, Essek.

5249
04:09:40.770 --> 04:09:42.078
You're not going to, like, leave here and

5250
04:09:42.078 --> 04:09:46.800
tell everyone that we know and then get us killed.

5251
04:09:46.800 --> 04:09:50.357
MATT: "Well, that depends. You show me a kindness."

5252
04:09:51.330 --> 04:09:55.223
LAURA: We've done nothing but show you kindness.

5253
04:09:57.840 --> 04:09:59.773
MATT: "You're not wrong."

5254
04:10:00.910 --> 04:10:03.052
TALIESIN: We're going to need

5255
04:10:03.052 --> 04:10:05.900
a certain amount of honesty going forward.

5256
04:10:07.070 --> 04:10:08.853
Rebuild some trust.

5257
04:10:08.853 --> 04:10:12.803
Otherwise, well,

5258
04:10:13.817 --> 04:10:15.830
Yasha, I mean, she's better at that part.

5259
04:10:15.830 --> 04:10:17.163
I'm not going to--

5260
04:10:17.163 --> 04:10:20.110
[laughter]

5261
04:10:20.110 --> 04:10:21.780
LIAM: But you haven't been spilling secrets

5262
04:10:21.780 --> 04:10:24.120
to people on the Assembly.

5263
04:10:24.120 --> 04:10:27.540
Now you can spill secrets to us

5264
04:10:27.540 --> 04:10:32.130
and we will move forward with this plan

5265
04:10:32.130 --> 04:10:34.990
and I am telling you there is a very high likelihood

5266
04:10:34.990 --> 04:10:37.940
that the people that you are dancing with mean

5267
04:10:37.940 --> 04:10:41.439
to cut your throat and leave you in the dust

5268
04:10:41.439 --> 04:10:43.760
with many others.

5269
04:10:43.760 --> 04:10:45.093
MATT: "Then perhaps it is best

5270
04:10:45.093 --> 04:10:49.735
"that I surround myself with friends to protect me.

5271
04:10:51.110 --> 04:10:55.820
"For the enemy of my friend is my enemy indeed, yes?"

5272
04:10:57.020 --> 04:11:00.996
TRAVIS: Is this charade at sea what it really appears to be?

5273
04:11:00.996 --> 04:11:05.460
No tricks, no double crosses, no twists or turns?

5274
04:11:05.460 --> 04:11:07.630
LIAM: No tampering with the artifact.

5275
04:11:07.630 --> 04:11:09.138
MATT: "Not from us.

5276
04:11:09.138 --> 04:11:12.555
"We have nothing to gain by it going awry."

5277
04:11:15.067 --> 04:11:18.320
LIAM: Well, you have a plan in place

5278
04:11:18.320 --> 04:11:21.210
and you think that will end this conflict.

5279
04:11:21.210 --> 04:11:25.690
I don't know that we agree. However, we move forward.

5280
04:11:25.690 --> 04:11:30.615
Can we count on you when the deal sours?

5281
04:11:35.150 --> 04:11:36.833
MATT: "I have far more allegiance to you

5282
04:11:36.833 --> 04:11:40.224
"than I do any Empire or Dynasty,

5283
04:11:40.224 --> 04:11:42.724

5289
04:12:01.050 --> 04:12:05.340

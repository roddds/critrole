00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.340
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.239
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:07.239 --> 00:00:08.906
TRAVIS: We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:08.906 --> 00:00:09.921
MARISHA: Woof, woof!

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:11.820
SAM: It's Arsenio now?

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.338
TRAVIS: Woof, woof, woof. '92 in the house!

00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:25.215
MATT: You were three. Anyway, before we get into
tonight's session, we do have a few announcements,

00:00:25.215 --> 00:00:32.558
beginning with our fantastic sponsors of campaign
two, and hopefully to infinity, D&amp;D Beyond! Sam?

00:00:32.558 --> 00:00:38.552
SAM: D&amp;D Beyond! Everybody, as all of you already
know, before I became an actor, I was a

00:00:38.552 --> 00:00:40.182
professional ventriloquist.

00:00:40.182 --> 00:00:41.915
TRAVIS: What is on your arm?

00:00:41.915 --> 00:00:48.126
SAM: Today, I thought I'd use the skills developed
in my former life to do a little bit of an act

00:00:48.126 --> 00:00:58.553
that I wrote for D&amp;D Beyond. I'd like you to meet
Yondi, the D&amp;D Beyond alpaca! I tried to rehearse

00:00:58.553 --> 00:01:05.771
this bit, but Liam walked in on me, so I stopped.
I've never rehearsed this bit before. Okay.

00:01:05.771 --> 00:01:11.489
(clears throat) Oh Yondi, D&amp;D Beyond is a great
company, isn't it? (high-pitched voice) "They're

00:01:11.489 --> 00:01:20.412
"very charitable!" Shit. This is going to not be
good. "They're very charitable; they're nice to

00:01:20.412 --> 00:01:26.221
"the dregs of society." Oh? Why do you say that?
"They're nice to you, aren't they?" Ooh.

00:01:26.532 --> 00:01:28.158
TRAVIS: Oh, Yondi!

00:01:28.158 --> 00:01:33.391
SAM: Well, come on, Yondi, people think I'm very
funny! "I think you're a douchebag." You apologize

00:01:33.391 --> 00:01:43.103
right now! "Okay, I'm sorry you're a douchebag."
This gag is already making me sick to my stomach.

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:52.744
"Oh yeah? Imagine if you had a hand up your ass!"
I've got <i>pages</i> of this stuff, guys! <i>Pages</i> of

00:01:52.744 --> 00:01:53.508
this stuff!

00:01:53.508 --> 00:01:55.839
LAURA: Did you look up ventriloquist jokes
online?

00:01:55.839 --> 00:02:03.968
SAM: Nope. Maybe, maybe. Let's talk about D&amp;D
Beyond, okay, Yondi? "Okay. People say using D&amp;D

00:02:03.968 --> 00:02:12.991
"Beyond makes you a smarter player." Oh yeah, <i>I</i>
use it! "Oh, then people must be wrong." Okay. A

00:02:12.991 --> 00:02:14.791
couple more, a couple more.

00:02:15.841 --> 00:02:18.344
TRAVIS: Best of show flashes.

00:02:18.344 --> 00:02:26.489
SAM: Yondi, D&amp;D Beyond helps you do math! Check it
out, what's six plus two damage? "77." No, that's

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:32.688
way too much. "One." That's way too little.
"You're hard to please." Oh, Yondi, please. You're

00:02:32.688 --> 00:02:40.520
not making Travis laugh at all. He doesn't find
this amusing at all. "Oh, figures. Tra--" (laughs)

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.607
Fucking shit!

00:02:42.607 --> 00:02:44.312
MARISHA: You're committed! Do it!

00:02:44.312 --> 00:02:46.105
TRAVIS: Get it out, get it out!

00:02:46.105 --> 00:02:53.255
SAM: "Figures. You know how to make Travis laugh
on a Thursday night?" How? "Tell him a joke on

00:02:53.255 --> 00:02:57.436
"Monday!" Because he's dumb!

00:02:59.661 --> 00:03:01.515
MARISHA: What?!

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.760
SAM: I've had enough. I really just need to tell
people where to sign up for D&amp;D Beyond. "No, what

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.477
"you really need is a breath mint." Oh boy.

00:03:11.513 --> 00:03:13.145
TRAVIS: Are you sweating?

00:03:14.505 --> 00:03:16.669
SAM: I think I have to go poop.

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:20.544
(laughter)

00:03:20.544 --> 00:03:28.408
SAM: All right, guys, sign up today at D&amp;D Beyond!
"And report Sam Riegel to PuppetAbuse.org!" Thank

00:03:28.408 --> 00:03:29.997
you, Yondi, thank you.

00:03:31.716 --> 00:03:33.024
LAURA: That was so bad!

00:03:33.024 --> 00:03:36.719
TRAVIS: Wow, Yondi. Never come back. Yondi, never
come back.

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:38.906
TALIESIN: There's a lot to un-alpaca there.

00:03:38.906 --> 00:03:42.039
TRAVIS: Oh, Taliesin, no!

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:46.435
LIAM: Tune in next week, when Sam Riegel will
stick his dick into a woodchipper!

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:48.485
TRAVIS: Man.

00:03:49.225 --> 00:03:51.816
MATT: This escalation is getting dangerous.

00:03:52.586 --> 00:03:54.778
SAM: I just lost so many votes.

00:03:54.788 --> 00:03:56.422
LAURA: You did. You really did.

00:03:56.422 --> 00:03:58.280
TRAVIS: Presidency is in jeopardy.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.018
MATT: You got a week to make it up. Thank you,
Sam. I'm sorry, D&amp;D Beyond.

00:04:04.448 --> 00:04:06.924
TALIESIN: Ventriloquist humor. We went there.

00:04:06.924 --> 00:04:09.730
LIAM: Liam O'Brien for change you can believe in.

00:04:12.097 --> 00:04:15.559
MATT: Man, I don't know how to follow that.

00:04:16.115 --> 00:04:18.954
LIAM: I don't think you do. I think we come back
next week.

00:04:18.954 --> 00:04:20.571
MATT: I think that's it, yeah.

00:04:20.571 --> 00:04:22.053
TALIESIN: That was a lot.

00:04:22.053 --> 00:04:23.624
SAM: I skipped several jokes.

00:04:23.624 --> 00:04:26.933
MATT: Thank you, you merciful man!

00:04:28.003 --> 00:04:30.571
TALIESIN: And you just gained several votes.
Well done!

00:04:30.571 --> 00:04:36.302
MATT: There you go. We are excited to announce
that Critical Role will now be using the official

00:04:36.302 --> 00:04:42.357
D&amp;D Beyond Twitch extension starting this week. It
is now available to view while watching Critical

00:04:42.357 --> 00:04:47.380
Role live, in a browser only, however. All you
have to do is mouse over the screen to see the

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.908
information from each character. To get a detailed
look at how the extension works, please go to

00:04:51.908 --> 00:04:59.661
critrole.com for information on how to get that
all set up. It has live updates from their devices

00:04:59.661 --> 00:05:02.438
throughout the show, so don't mess it up, guys.

00:05:02.438 --> 00:05:04.675
TRAVIS: Don't yell at us if we get stuff wrong.

00:05:04.675 --> 00:05:05.659
LIAM: No promises.

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:07.952
TALIESIN: Join us.

00:05:07.952 --> 00:05:10.478
SAM: Guys, the inside of that alpaca stinks.

00:05:10.818 --> 00:05:13.299
TALIESIN: Why did you smell the inside of the
alpaca?

00:05:13.299 --> 00:05:14.685
SAM: I can smell my hands!

00:05:14.685 --> 00:05:16.778
LAURA: Ew, gross! Go wash your hands!

00:05:18.148 --> 00:05:26.039
TRAVIS: What does it taste like? Get your tongue
out and taste the tip of your finger! Do it now! Yes!

00:05:26.299 --> 00:05:30.183
LIAM: Maybe you can drink out of its ass at the
next live show.

00:05:31.493 --> 00:05:34.392
MATT: Travis, I believe you have an announcement.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.932
TRAVIS: I'm going to be quitting the show.

00:05:37.932 --> 00:05:43.188
(laughter)

00:05:43.188 --> 00:05:54.727
TRAVIS: Wow. (gibbering) Guys, we are mere days
away from our Kickstarter launch of our very first

00:05:54.727 --> 00:06:01.733
animated special! My god, three days away. We
thought it'd be cool to share some information

00:06:01.733 --> 00:06:09.220
about the special with you right now. Little sneak
peek. First, the title. We are calling it The

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:16.690
Legend of Vox Machina. It is in canon, and it
takes place before our streaming game started. All

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:20.148
of our characters will be right around level
seven.

00:06:20.148 --> 00:06:21.198
LIAM: And alive.

00:06:21.198 --> 00:06:26.785
TRAVIS: There will be original storyline, and
everybody's going to die. Wait, no, I wasn't

00:06:26.785 --> 00:06:33.591
supposed to say that part. Our big launch is this
Monday, March 4th. We are so incredibly humbled by

00:06:33.591 --> 00:06:38.016
all of the love that you've shown us so far.
Everything we've seen on social media is amazing.

00:06:38.016 --> 00:06:42.994
You're echoing everything that we've been wanting
for the past two and a half years. We can't bring

00:06:42.994 --> 00:06:48.588
this animated venture, The Legend of Vox Machina,
to life without you. Please stay tuned to our

00:06:48.588 --> 00:06:54.608
social media accounts and our website for more
information on the big launch that's coming on Monday!

00:06:54.965 --> 00:06:56.970
MARISHA: Monday, Monday, Monday.

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:01.786
TRAVIS: I'm a little excited. I have trouble
containing myself when it comes to animation.

00:07:02.286 --> 00:07:03.145
That's it.

00:07:03.445 --> 00:07:06.164
MATT: Thank you, Travis. Need an alpaca to
finish up?

00:07:06.164 --> 00:07:10.685
TRAVIS: I might, I might. Do you have any other
puppet farm animals that you haven't abused yet?

00:07:10.685 --> 00:07:14.739
SAM: (high-pitched voice) I don't! (normal voice)
Oh, that's Nott's voice.

00:07:14.739 --> 00:07:22.210
MATT: On that note, I think we are thankfully done
with our announcements tonight. With that, I think

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:26.386
it's time for us to jump into tonight's episode of
Critical Role.

00:07:28.574 --> 00:07:31.079
[water bubbling]

00:07:31.079 --> 00:07:35.341
[thunder]

00:07:36.341 --> 00:07:37.645
[explosion]

00:07:38.285 --> 00:07:42.351
(chanting) Role! Critical! Role!

00:07:42.576 --> 00:07:47.345
[dramatic Critical Role theme]

00:07:50.320 --> 00:08:00.257
LAURA: Roll the dice! (singing) The adventure
begins, they were always beside you, your nerdy

00:08:00.257 --> 00:08:07.569
best friends, and the DM to guide you. And they
rise from the flames for the battles ahead.

00:08:07.569 --> 00:08:11.856
Villains beware 'cause you're about to be dead.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:21.578
ASHLEY: (singing) They got magic and flair, they
got falchions and cunning. They don't see over

00:08:21.578 --> 00:08:29.221
there there's a monster incoming. Inspiration is
waiting, rise up, don't think twice. Put your fate

00:08:29.221 --> 00:08:32.636
in your hands, take a chance, roll the dice!

00:08:33.106 --> 00:08:39.892
(chanting) Role! Critical! Role!

00:08:41.122 --> 00:08:46.390
ASHLEY and LAURA: (singing) Can you answer the
call? Diggin' deep in your soul as the legend

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:56.166
unfolds. Now it's your turn to roll!

00:08:57.386 --> 00:09:04.434
[fire burning]

00:09:05.368 --> 00:09:15.532
MATT: Welcome back. Last we left off, Mighty Nein
had been heading east, absconding from the Empire

00:09:15.532 --> 00:09:22.783
to pursue the threads that lead towards the
kidnapped husband of Nott in her former life.

00:09:22.783 --> 00:09:30.182
Gathering your materials, following the signs that
this burrowing incursion into Felderwin by the

00:09:30.182 --> 00:09:36.177
Kryn Dynasty had headed beneath the ground and due
east, you went through these tunnels, encountered

00:09:36.177 --> 00:09:43.789
a few challenges, and then emerged in the eastern
wastes of Xhorhas. A few conflicts later, almost

00:09:43.789 --> 00:09:50.797
being hunted down by a roc, you made a friend who
was a bugbear. He led you to the City of Beasts,

00:09:50.797 --> 00:10:01.943
Asarius. There, you took on a few more monstrous
forms, visually, and began to note the brewing

00:10:01.943 --> 00:10:08.554
battlements and army that seems to be preparing
itself for future incoming conflict with the

00:10:08.554 --> 00:10:16.898
Empire against the Ashkeeper Peaks and beyond. You
saw a possible means of traversing quicker to the

00:10:16.898 --> 00:10:25.115
east in the way of the moorbounders. You decided
to work out a transaction with Zorth, the goblin

00:10:25.115 --> 00:10:34.096
purveyor of these, and got a discount by aiding
him with some sort of unhappy scenario happening

00:10:34.096 --> 00:10:41.878
in the breeding caves beneath his establishment.
There, you did battle with a number of fiendish

00:10:41.878 --> 00:10:49.544
entities and completed your quest. Upon inquiring
about what more information there could be, or at

00:10:49.544 --> 00:10:55.739
least making a small name for yourself as
taskmasters, you were given towards Lady Zethris

00:10:55.739 --> 00:11:08.235
Oleos, one of the apparently more official Kryn
within Asarius. The investigators extraordinaire

00:11:08.235 --> 00:11:15.052
over here, Nott and Jester, were given two
possible tasks, which they could pursue with

00:11:15.052 --> 00:11:21.718
monetary compensation or possibly favor with some
of the powerful entities, including the Bright

00:11:21.718 --> 00:11:28.768
Queen, that exist in the capital of Ghor Dranas.
We left off with you leaving the city of Asarius

00:11:28.768 --> 00:11:34.445
to take a break in the wilds in the outskirts of
the city. That's where we begin tonight. As you

00:11:34.445 --> 00:11:38.916
guys prepare to rest for the night, is there
anything you want to do or prepare, or anything in

00:11:38.916 --> 00:11:42.868
particular? Or are we going to take a night's
sleep and then pick up in the morning?

00:11:42.868 --> 00:11:47.578
TRAVIS: I don't like the way you said that. It was
far too casual. What's on the other side of this,

00:11:47.578 --> 00:11:48.548
Matt? Tell us now.

00:11:48.764 --> 00:11:50.006
MATT: As you're sleeping--

00:11:50.006 --> 00:11:51.324
TRAVIS: (yelling gibberish)

00:11:51.974 --> 00:11:54.647
LAURA: Somebody should keep watch, right?

00:11:54.647 --> 00:11:56.362
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll take first watch.

00:11:56.362 --> 00:12:01.797
LIAM: I will put up the dome and the silver wire
and leave my cat on top of the dome.

00:12:02.967 --> 00:12:07.602
MATT: Most of you get a rest. Fjord, you have
first watch. Roll a perception check for me.

00:12:07.602 --> 00:12:11.294
TRAVIS: Not a problem. 13.

00:12:11.634 --> 00:12:13.490
LAURA: That's better than it's been.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.028
TRAVIS: Wow. Why are you bringing up old shit?

00:12:17.645 --> 00:12:25.527
MATT: First watch, as you begin paying attention
to the surrounding darkness of the sunless wastes,

00:12:27.247 --> 00:12:33.582
nothing occurs. You arrive nice and safe. You do
see the shifting firelight of the dozens of

00:12:33.582 --> 00:12:38.178
torches being carried through the front lines of
this army. You do see some now moving eastward,

00:12:38.178 --> 00:12:45.058
sections of that massive crew of soldiers and
warbeasts. Elements of that seem to be moving

00:12:45.058 --> 00:12:52.473
east-- or, westward from this position. No other
issues during your rest, so you complete your

00:12:52.473 --> 00:12:53.445
evening's sleep.

00:12:53.445 --> 00:12:55.681
TRAVIS: I'll relay it to whoever takes my spot.

00:12:55.681 --> 00:12:57.299
MATT: Whoever's taking next watch?

00:12:57.299 --> 00:12:58.527
TALIESIN: I'll take next.

00:12:58.587 --> 00:13:00.350
MATT: Roll a perception check for me.

00:13:03.549 --> 00:13:04.648
TALIESIN: 11.

00:13:04.768 --> 00:13:15.739
MATT: Okay. As you keep an eye over the
surrounding shadows and the faint elements of

00:13:15.739 --> 00:13:22.724
softened moonlight that seems to punch through
elements of the clouds passing overhead and gently

00:13:22.724 --> 00:13:28.477
highlight the shapes in the distant horizon across
these wastes, nothing seems to catch your

00:13:28.477 --> 00:13:35.768
attention. Though the rain has somewhat stopped
for the evening, and there's a bit of calm and

00:13:35.768 --> 00:13:40.583
silence, which is comfortable and preferable for
you at this juncture.

00:13:40.783 --> 00:13:41.739
TALIESIN: Yep.

00:13:42.579 --> 00:13:43.533
MATT: Fjord.

00:13:45.523 --> 00:13:47.265
TRAVIS: Oh, shit. Fuck!

00:13:47.675 --> 00:13:49.524
MARISHA: It's been some time!

00:13:50.854 --> 00:13:52.142
SAM: (whispers) Wet dreams!

00:13:52.142 --> 00:14:07.151
MATT: Dry, empty plains. Flat, open, featureless.
An endless horizon of empty earth. Beneath you,

00:14:07.151 --> 00:14:13.683
something shifts. You look down, your feet
standing above a spring, small and trickling,

00:14:13.683 --> 00:14:20.997
burbling up from the ground below. The waters spew
forth and begin to spread, rapidly drowning this

00:14:20.997 --> 00:14:26.401
endless expanse around you in shifting waves. The
level of the water goes beyond your nose, and you

00:14:26.401 --> 00:14:31.621
struggle to try to swim with it, but find your
feet anchored to the ground beneath you. The

00:14:31.621 --> 00:14:42.963
surface escapes you upward, leaving you in
freezing depths, fathoms below. "Watching." The

00:14:42.963 --> 00:14:50.870
shadowed shape of an ever-twisting serpent form
writhes in cages around you in all directions.

00:14:52.590 --> 00:15:05.257
"Return." A single, massive, yellow serpent eye
appears before you. Then another. Big and small.

00:15:05.547 --> 00:15:11.300
Your entire periphery becomes dozens and dozens of
different-sized yellow eyes, single-slitted,

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:22.056
staring directly at you. "Reward." The shaded
tendrils of Uk'otoa begin to close in around you,

00:15:22.056 --> 00:15:33.032
binding you in a cocoon of cold, scaled flesh.
"Wonder." The tendrils knot and flex, crushing

00:15:33.032 --> 00:15:38.598
your body slowly. The pain is immeasurable. Your
vision darkens, and your body begins bleeding as

00:15:38.598 --> 00:15:48.703
you feel everything compress the life from you.
"Punish." A final squeeze sends the last breath

00:15:48.703 --> 00:15:53.012
from your lungs in a muffled scream. You shoot
awake, vomiting onto the ground next to you.

00:15:53.012 --> 00:15:58.620
Caduceus, you see this, as suddenly he shoots up.
You look down, eyes blinking, to see foam and

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:02.223
briny seawater now slowly soaking into the
hard-packed ground.

00:16:06.469 --> 00:16:08.410
TALIESIN: Mr. Fjord, are you all right?

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:18.717
TRAVIS: (spitting) Yeah, just another dream.

00:16:19.454 --> 00:16:31.460
TALIESIN: Would you characterize this as a
positive encouragement, or perhaps a more

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:33.067
negative reinforcement?

00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:49.969
TRAVIS: I think more the latter. I don't feel like
my favor with old Uk'otoa is as choice as it once was.

00:16:51.329 --> 00:16:53.568
TALIESIN: Why do you think it's angry with you?

00:16:53.568 --> 00:16:57.842
TRAVIS: You remember I told you there were words
that were repeated through these visions?

00:16:58.182 --> 00:16:59.638
TALIESIN: No, but sure.

00:17:01.766 --> 00:17:11.648
TRAVIS: Right. I tell him about the four words.
Given that, there were two new words. Three,

00:17:11.648 --> 00:17:15.801
maybe. I don't know. I'll have to go back and
watch it on VOD.

00:17:19.371 --> 00:17:24.225
TALIESIN: I think the gods and goddesses of
Twitter will remind you of all those words, within minutes.

00:17:24.225 --> 00:17:31.977
TRAVIS: If only someone would draw it. It was
laced with a threat.

00:17:32.897 --> 00:17:33.929
TALIESIN: A threat?

00:17:35.245 --> 00:17:44.266
TRAVIS: I'm supposed to be helping it to be
released, right? Freed upon the world. I have

00:17:44.266 --> 00:17:56.026
decided that that's not the best course of action.
In my dream, it saw fit to crush me.

00:17:57.834 --> 00:18:02.559
TALIESIN: Well, how do you feel, now that you're
not dreaming anymore?

00:18:04.407 --> 00:18:05.326
TRAVIS: Better.

00:18:05.836 --> 00:18:07.952
TALIESIN: Well, that's good.

00:18:07.952 --> 00:18:12.144
TRAVIS: Do you ever feel like you're not going to
wake up from a dream when you're in it?

00:18:12.144 --> 00:18:24.989
TALIESIN: Yeah, but here you are. I'm sure it
would put greater strain and stress against you

00:18:24.989 --> 00:18:29.901
for not following its wishes if it could, but
it didn't.

00:18:30.571 --> 00:18:32.071
TRAVIS: What if it can?

00:18:32.331 --> 00:18:33.695
TALIESIN: Why hasn't it?

00:18:35.985 --> 00:18:42.846
TRAVIS: I don't know. One thing I am sure of,
though: it feels stronger. It feels more present, closer.

00:18:43.301 --> 00:18:51.385
TALIESIN: Well, I'm proud of you for maintaining
your sense of self through all this. It's

00:18:51.385 --> 00:18:55.588
difficult sometimes when one is pulled by things
greater than ourselves.

00:18:55.778 --> 00:19:00.801
TRAVIS: You said you commune with the Mother.

00:19:00.801 --> 00:19:01.851
TALIESIN: I do.

00:19:02.221 --> 00:19:07.662
TRAVIS: Is it a two-way thing, or are you just
putting yourself out there and seeing what comes back?

00:19:09.563 --> 00:19:16.451
TALIESIN: Very much a two-way thing. There's no
way-- nature isn't separate. We're part of it. We

00:19:16.451 --> 00:19:23.977
communicate with the world every day, with every
breath. Everything we do is our declaration of our

00:19:23.977 --> 00:19:26.829
love, adoration, or our denial of it.

00:19:28.056 --> 00:19:35.392
TRAVIS: Do you think she cares about the affairs
of something like this?

00:19:35.542 --> 00:19:42.625
TALIESIN: Very much so. Without a doubt. I mean,
I'm here.

00:19:43.726 --> 00:19:48.531
TRAVIS: I'm getting the feeling that, maybe, if I
do nothing, like any kind of disease, it might get

00:19:50.831 --> 00:19:58.045
worse. Maybe I should start thinking about a
counteragent.

00:19:58.045 --> 00:19:59.977
TALIESIN: Is that what you want?

00:20:00.177 --> 00:20:11.324
TRAVIS: Maybe. My dreams are one thing, right? I
kick some dirt on the vomit and spittle. That shit is--

00:20:11.716 --> 00:20:13.289
TALIESIN: It looks uncomfortable.

00:20:13.289 --> 00:20:19.301
TRAVIS: It's real. So I don't know.

00:20:20.301 --> 00:20:26.905
TALIESIN: I think it's worth thinking about. I
think there will come a day where you really will

00:20:26.905 --> 00:20:35.581
have to make that choice. We'll help you with that
choice, whatever it ends up being. I do think

00:20:35.581 --> 00:20:44.337
you're on a path; and I don't necessarily think
it's the path of just being a servant to some

00:20:44.337 --> 00:20:48.560
creature. I'm very impressed, though.

00:20:50.598 --> 00:20:51.520
TRAVIS: Thanks.

00:20:51.967 --> 00:20:57.902
TALIESIN: I'll cook something if you need to put
that in-- a lot came out of you.

00:20:58.192 --> 00:21:02.380
TRAVIS: Yeah. I'll be fine. I'm just going to
crash back out, if you don't mind.

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:07.526
TALIESIN: No, no problem. I may have to tell the
others in the morning, just for safety's sake.

00:21:10.707 --> 00:21:11.868
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:21:12.789 --> 00:21:16.456
TALIESIN: Everybody is going to take care of you.
It's going to be all right.

00:21:16.745 --> 00:21:19.590
TRAVIS: I turn over and try to go back to sleep.

00:21:21.762 --> 00:21:26.721
MATT: The rest of the evening is relatively
uneventful. A full night's rest is achieved by the

00:21:26.721 --> 00:21:32.727
party, as restless as you may have been through
most of it, Fjord. You all come to consciousness

00:21:32.727 --> 00:21:39.328
in a colder morning than the ones you had
previously endured out here. It seems in the wake

00:21:39.328 --> 00:21:47.360
of the recent rains, you see a gentle frost that's
beginning to coat the nearby horizon in a sprinkle

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:56.851
of white shards of ice. As soon as the dome fades,
you can see your breath emanate and dissipate into

00:21:56.851 --> 00:22:01.436
the atmosphere around you with each exhale. You
find yourselves bundling up a bit.

00:22:01.819 --> 00:22:10.716
TRAVIS: Can I ask, as the morning comes, am I
sore? Is there any bruising, or--?

00:22:11.425 --> 00:22:15.892
MATT: Checking yourself, there's no physical
bruising. There is a bit of soreness, but it seems

00:22:15.898 --> 00:22:22.203
to be relegated directly to the central abdomen,
where the heaving would have come from. Nothing

00:22:22.203 --> 00:22:25.212
that correlates with the end of your dream.

00:22:25.362 --> 00:22:26.599
TRAVIS: That's good.

00:22:26.869 --> 00:22:33.719
LIAM: (exhaling) You can see your breath. It's
nice to have something familiar.

00:22:34.019 --> 00:22:39.817
LAURA: It's funny. Everyone said that Xhorhas was
very ugly, but looking out, it kind of looks like

00:22:39.817 --> 00:22:41.689
a field of diamonds right now.

00:22:41.769 --> 00:22:47.155
MARISHA: It's glistening. Just like in that smut
book you gave me!

00:22:47.155 --> 00:22:52.409
LAURA: Yeah! It all comes back to the smut. Thank
you, Caleb.

00:22:53.275 --> 00:22:59.151
LIAM: I know that you have an interest in
seafaring, so did you learn a lot?

00:22:59.411 --> 00:23:01.056
LAURA: So much.

00:23:02.156 --> 00:23:04.381
LIAM: Name three parts of a boat.

00:23:05.703 --> 00:23:15.071
LAURA: Oh. The port side, the poop deck, and the
mast.

00:23:18.663 --> 00:23:20.466
LIAM: You are a silly goose.

00:23:24.575 --> 00:23:26.749
LAURA: Are you okay, Fjord? You look weird.

00:23:27.319 --> 00:23:38.247
TRAVIS: Yeah. I didn't sleep very good. I-- er...
Wow, everyone's so attentive this morning. Nobody

00:23:38.247 --> 00:23:39.578
needs to get ready?

00:23:40.028 --> 00:23:41.425
SAM: We're in a bubble.

00:23:42.305 --> 00:23:43.867
TRAVIS: There's room!

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:47.029
LIAM: The bubble has faded.

00:23:49.819 --> 00:23:56.202
TRAVIS: I had, as I've told Ducey here, another
dream.

00:23:56.631 --> 00:23:57.878
MARISHA: A wet dream?

00:23:58.078 --> 00:24:01.008
TRAVIS: Not wet. There was moisture.

00:24:01.008 --> 00:24:04.244
TALIESIN: It was pretty wet, actually. It was an
extremely wet dream.

00:24:04.244 --> 00:24:06.293
TRAVIS: Okay. The distinction is important.

00:24:06.293 --> 00:24:10.672
TALIESIN: There's a big puddle right over there
from it. I don't-- I mean, why wouldn't you--

00:24:10.672 --> 00:24:12.692
TRAVIS: Yes, I had another wet dream.

00:24:12.692 --> 00:24:14.442
LIAM: More of the same, or what?

00:24:15.302 --> 00:24:23.514
TRAVIS: Kind of. The previous dreams were more
encouraging, like telling me to go forward and

00:24:23.514 --> 00:24:28.998
help it. This one felt a little more upset.

00:24:30.025 --> 00:24:32.278
LAURA: Because you're not in the water?

00:24:33.178 --> 00:24:38.257
TRAVIS: I think because we're not trying to let it
out.

00:24:39.302 --> 00:24:40.176
LAURA: Right.

00:24:40.176 --> 00:24:41.052
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:24:41.352 --> 00:24:47.798
LIAM: Are you at all nervous what will happen as
we proceed towards the Kryn Dynasty?

00:24:47.798 --> 00:24:54.267
TRAVIS: Well, it's been a while since my last
dream. They're not super fun, so if that's the

00:24:54.267 --> 00:24:58.153
regularity in which I have to experience them, I
guess I'll just deal with it.

00:24:59.069 --> 00:25:01.462
LAURA: What do you mean? He seemed unhappy?

00:25:02.262 --> 00:25:11.214
TRAVIS: Well, it was the first time that old
demi-snake-god killed me at the end.

00:25:13.654 --> 00:25:18.130
SAM: I mean, you don't know that that's
necessarily-- that could be something else in your

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:21.185
life that is troubling you that you manifested in
a dream, right?

00:25:21.185 --> 00:25:22.302
MARISHA: Sure, stress.

00:25:22.302 --> 00:25:24.307
SAM: Are you stressed about anything else?

00:25:24.307 --> 00:25:27.271
LIAM: Weaving itself together with this connection
you have.

00:25:27.271 --> 00:25:32.495
SAM: Usually, work stress can make bad dreams. Are
you having any stress at work?

00:25:32.835 --> 00:25:34.520
TRAVIS: This is our work, right?

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:35.279
SAM: Yeah.

00:25:35.279 --> 00:25:38.563
TRAVIS: Not particularly. I mean, other than giant
rocs and bugbears--

00:25:38.563 --> 00:25:43.293
SAM: Sometimes when you get a new supervisor or
something, that can affect it. Now that Caleb's in

00:25:43.293 --> 00:25:46.416
charge, is that affecting your general mood
at all?

00:25:46.536 --> 00:25:50.742
LIAM: Wait. Hold on a second. Different topic. Why
do you keep doing this?

00:25:50.742 --> 00:25:51.587
SAM: What?

00:25:51.587 --> 00:25:54.346
LIAM: I am not in charge of this group. I don't
want to be.

00:25:54.406 --> 00:26:01.150
SAM: You should be. No offense, you're clearly the
smartest, and possibly the only smart one of us.

00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:03.306
LAURA: I'm really smart, okay?

00:26:03.876 --> 00:26:04.952
SAM: Sure, sure, sure.

00:26:04.952 --> 00:26:06.155
LAURA: Super duper smart.

00:26:06.155 --> 00:26:08.492
TRAVIS: Beau is right here, okay? Just saying.

00:26:08.492 --> 00:26:10.835
MARISHA: Wait, are you calling me smart, or dumb?

00:26:10.835 --> 00:26:12.242
TRAVIS: What do you think?

00:26:12.242 --> 00:26:14.006
LIAM: You're hard to read, sometimes.

00:26:14.258 --> 00:26:15.875
TRAVIS: I keep eating this pebble.

00:26:15.875 --> 00:26:19.924
(laughter)

00:26:21.337 --> 00:26:23.371
TRAVIS: Oh no, a tusk!

00:26:23.371 --> 00:26:25.470
MATT: He spits a couple chunks of tooth out.

00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:28.852
LIAM: I am good with numbers, and with puzzles,
<i>ja</i>?

00:26:29.756 --> 00:26:31.330
SAM: Directions, memories.

00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:33.918
LIAM: Decision-making is a little questionable.

00:26:33.918 --> 00:26:39.874
SAM: I have seen some excellent, excellent
decision-making. The Wall of Fire on the boat was

00:26:39.874 --> 00:26:42.074
brilliant! It was a stroke of tactical genius.

00:26:42.074 --> 00:26:47.509
TRAVIS: Yes, Nott, to answer your question, I
think Caleb is a fantastic leader. Also Beau, or

00:26:47.509 --> 00:26:52.597
Jester, Yasha, Caduceus-- almost anyone in the
group except you. (sniffs)

00:26:53.898 --> 00:26:56.072
MARISHA: Ooh, shots fired.

00:26:56.072 --> 00:26:58.457
LAURA: I think you would make a great leader,
Nott.

00:26:58.467 --> 00:27:03.234
SAM: Thank you, Jester. I appreciate that, but
you're wrong. It's Caleb.

00:27:03.284 --> 00:27:05.616
TALIESIN: I don't think we have a leader, really.

00:27:05.616 --> 00:27:14.514
LIAM: No, we all have our strengths here. We're
all good at certain things. So, you know-- we

00:27:14.514 --> 00:27:18.740
don't need to keep on that tack. We're working
together now.

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:28.792
SAM: I understand, and I will leave it alone for
now. Aye aye, commander.

00:27:30.702 --> 00:27:37.234
MARISHA: Commander? That feels worse. Do we have
to call you commander, now?

00:27:37.234 --> 00:27:39.750
LIAM: Do not call me commander.

00:27:41.457 --> 00:27:42.584
You can call me--

00:27:42.584 --> 00:27:44.233
TRAVIS: Admiral Widogast!

00:27:44.233 --> 00:27:46.322
LIAM: Caleb Widogast is my name.

00:27:46.412 --> 00:27:48.108
SAM: That's actually not your name.

00:27:48.108 --> 00:27:53.080
(laughter)

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:56.120
SAM: It's a made-up name. You made it up
on the spot.

00:27:56.976 --> 00:28:01.544
LIAM: The way that I am smiling and blushing right
now is what Caleb does, and he just walks away

00:28:01.544 --> 00:28:04.873
from the group to take a breath, and not look
anyone in the eye.

00:28:05.403 --> 00:28:10.773
MARISHA: To be fair, some of the smartest people
that I know? Also terrible leaders.

00:28:10.773 --> 00:28:12.193
LIAM: Holla!

00:28:13.643 --> 00:28:14.834
SAM: What does that mean?

00:28:14.834 --> 00:28:17.006
(laughter)

00:28:17.006 --> 00:28:19.509
MATT: It's a cultural thing. You wouldn't
understand.

00:28:21.245 --> 00:28:25.187
TRAVIS: We've got to do that. It might be the new
"bidet."

00:28:27.414 --> 00:28:31.774
SAM: All right. We have a decision to make, and
seeing as how our leader has walked away

00:28:31.774 --> 00:28:38.402
temporarily, let's put this to a more democratic
vote. We have two options in front of us. Sort of

00:28:38.402 --> 00:28:49.154
two-and-a-half. We can either charge across the
plains towards finding my kidnapped husband in

00:28:49.154 --> 00:28:58.108
Ghor Dranas, find him, rescue him, have a happy
reunion, all is good. Lots of unknowns in that

00:28:58.108 --> 00:29:01.864
scenario. Or, we have a job offer--

00:29:02.656 --> 00:29:03.984
LAURA: Mm-hmm, multiple.

00:29:03.984 --> 00:29:10.289
SAM: From Lady Zethris, to do some work for her in
the city, which would give us, maybe, the

00:29:10.289 --> 00:29:14.045
financial means that would help us
in our journeys ahead.

00:29:14.045 --> 00:29:15.114
LAURA: Or a favor.

00:29:15.114 --> 00:29:21.035
SAM: Or a favor. Which, fingers crossed, maybe she
could just organize the release of my husband, and

00:29:21.035 --> 00:29:22.748
we don't have to do the second part.

00:29:22.748 --> 00:29:29.242
LAURA: But how would we tell her that he needs to
be released, and not make it like, "Oh, that's my

00:29:29.242 --> 00:29:33.057
"husband, from the Empire." (gasps) Okay, we're not
in the city.

00:29:33.057 --> 00:29:38.777
SAM: No. But what would it matter? If we earn a
favor, I take her at her word. She would have to

00:29:38.777 --> 00:29:41.383
give us a favor, regardless of why we're asking
for it.

00:29:41.383 --> 00:29:44.383
LIAM: Yeah, did she seem to place any conditions
on this favor?

00:29:44.473 --> 00:29:51.718
LAURA: Well, no. But she also-- she's in charge,
and we're not. She could do whatever she wants.

00:29:51.738 --> 00:29:52.787
TALIESIN: That's true.

00:29:52.787 --> 00:29:56.970
LIAM: That's not a very good favor, though, for
endangering our lives for her?

00:29:57.210 --> 00:30:03.261
LAURA: Well, no. But if you're like, "I'll give
you a favor," and then somebody cashes in and

00:30:03.261 --> 00:30:10.415
they're like, "Oh, in order to cash in, you have
to cut open your hand, and put it on this thing,

00:30:10.415 --> 00:30:16.116
"and maybe do some really horrible blood oath,"
would you do that as a favor? I mean, no, right?

00:30:16.226 --> 00:30:18.825
LIAM: I turn around and walk back to my spot.

00:30:19.905 --> 00:30:22.298
TALIESIN: Who are you dealing with? That's a lot.

00:30:22.298 --> 00:30:23.352
LAURA: That was a lot.

00:30:23.352 --> 00:30:25.265
TALIESIN: People like, bleed into the--

00:30:25.265 --> 00:30:27.312
SAM: That was a very specific hypothetical.

00:30:27.312 --> 00:30:30.261
LAURA: I'm just saying. Some people, they do weird
things.

00:30:30.261 --> 00:30:34.689
TRAVIS: Also, you know, the more time we spend
here, the more we assimilate a bit. Maybe we'll

00:30:34.689 --> 00:30:39.741
get some allies. If we rush across, could be a bit
hasty. We might jeopardize the whole thing.

00:30:39.741 --> 00:30:40.831
MARISHA: It's true.

00:30:40.831 --> 00:30:45.929
TALIESIN: We'll probably stick out less if we make
a few friends and figure out how this place works.

00:30:45.929 --> 00:30:50.114
TRAVIS: Stopping here, we've already got some
steeds waiting for us, if we're successful.

00:30:50.114 --> 00:30:56.825
SAM: We need to do our practice, right? Bounder
practice? Then maybe we could ask about Lady

00:30:56.825 --> 00:31:04.655
Zethris's reliability, her trustworthiness. If
people vouch for her, like, "She always does her

00:31:04.655 --> 00:31:05.729
"favors," or whatever.

00:31:05.729 --> 00:31:08.302
TRAVIS: Does she have a lot of business in Ghor
Dranas?

00:31:08.302 --> 00:31:11.152
SAM: Yeah, is she connected with the-- I don't
know.

00:31:11.152 --> 00:31:15.945
TALIESIN: Also, as I have not made food this
morning, because we're close enough to a town, we

00:31:15.945 --> 00:31:22.964
should probably grab some food and otherwise, because
I'm trying to stock up for keeping people healthy.

00:31:25.083 --> 00:31:26.141
MARISHA: Okay.

00:31:27.521 --> 00:31:33.780
LIAM: This sounds like a decent course of action
to me. My one concern, not a dealbreaker, but I

00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:39.082
feel like we should continue to check in with
Nott's husband, but I don't know how far exactly

00:31:39.082 --> 00:31:45.956
we are from him. I think it is a good idea to try
to curry favor, and not rush headlong into

00:31:45.956 --> 00:31:50.677
we-don't-know-what. But what happens if you check
in with him, and they are going to take him to the

00:31:50.677 --> 00:31:53.302
chopping block? I don't know. I mean, what happens
then?

00:31:53.302 --> 00:31:54.733
SAM: We have to go right away.

00:31:54.733 --> 00:31:56.636
LIAM: We are a very long way away.

00:31:57.076 --> 00:32:00.174
TALIESIN: Then we let our favor be known before we
finish the job.

00:32:00.614 --> 00:32:05.086
LAURA: She probably has something like Sending,
too. Or like somebody that could send a message

00:32:05.086 --> 00:32:08.607
like I can send a message. Like I could send a
message through her person--

00:32:08.607 --> 00:32:12.352
SAM: Maybe she's so powerful she can-- boom--
teleport us there, or something.

00:32:12.352 --> 00:32:14.779
LAURA: Oh, right, some people can do that. I
forgot.

00:32:14.779 --> 00:32:15.948
SAM: I don't know.

00:32:15.948 --> 00:32:20.415
MARISHA: Regardless, I feel like we have to gain
her trust a little bit first. I don't think we

00:32:20.415 --> 00:32:25.875
should say anything about your husband until we at
least do-- what? It seemed like there was a job,

00:32:25.875 --> 00:32:28.162
and then a harder job? A kind-of-easier job?

00:32:28.162 --> 00:32:31.690
LAURA: Yeah. we should come up with something
other than he's your husband.

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:39.784
SAM: Okay. Pitch me. I'm a goblin and he was my--

00:32:39.784 --> 00:32:40.989
LAURA: Your servant!

00:32:40.989 --> 00:32:45.759
TRAVIS: Murdered your whole family. You own him.
You have a blood debt.

00:32:45.759 --> 00:32:47.193
SAM: And I need to collect it.

00:32:47.193 --> 00:32:53.119
LAURA: Ooh, ooh! He's your goblin husband, that
was reincarnated as this stupid halfling, and you

00:32:53.119 --> 00:32:54.524
hate halflings!

00:32:54.704 --> 00:32:57.568
SAM: Oh, boy. This is a stretch!

00:32:57.568 --> 00:33:00.871
LAURA: But maybe you could get him back and turn
him back into a goblin.

00:33:00.871 --> 00:33:08.486
SAM: I mean, that is a compelling storyline. If I
had met a character like that, I would fall in

00:33:08.486 --> 00:33:11.731
love with that character, and want to protect it
with my life.

00:33:12.851 --> 00:33:17.648
LIAM: What if we are a group of mercenaries who
have been sent here to collect this gentleman and

00:33:17.648 --> 00:33:18.648
bring him back?

00:33:19.848 --> 00:33:21.848
SAM: That's simpler. That's much simpler.

00:33:21.848 --> 00:33:25.614
TALIESIN: I like that. I mean, it's also not that
far from the truth.

00:33:27.094 --> 00:33:33.397
MARISHA: We know that the Kryn have been pulling a
lot of people for experiments. We could just say,

00:33:35.337 --> 00:33:39.103
"Not today, Kryn."

00:33:39.103 --> 00:33:44.007
TALIESIN: We're only invested in saving one man.
We're only invested in looking for this one thing.

00:33:45.837 --> 00:33:49.767
We're not foreign agents or anything like that;
we're not invested in this fight.

00:33:50.797 --> 00:33:59.135
LIAM: If I know anything, wars are muddy. They're
hazy. People have their credos they stick to, but

00:33:59.135 --> 00:34:02.451
things go against the grain often enough.

00:34:02.451 --> 00:34:05.404
TALIESIN: People have to live their life in the
middle of this.

00:34:05.404 --> 00:34:09.634
LIAM: For the right amount of coin, or for the
right amount of favor, anything can happen,

00:34:09.634 --> 00:34:10.551
despite a war.

00:34:10.551 --> 00:34:17.187
TALIESIN: If we prove to be helpful in this small
instance, then perhaps she'll understand that we

00:34:17.187 --> 00:34:18.836
just have our own needs.

00:34:18.836 --> 00:34:23.410
TRAVIS: We haven't used the dodecahedron and the
stand together, right? We're assuming that those

00:34:23.410 --> 00:34:25.300
two things make it even more powerful?

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:26.175
TALIESIN: Wow.

00:34:26.175 --> 00:34:29.272
TRAVIS: What if we just gave them the stand, in
exchange for him?

00:34:31.412 --> 00:34:32.420
LAURA: Wait, what?

00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:35.813
SAM: They're talking about giving up the tripod
for old Yeza.

00:34:35.813 --> 00:34:40.646
TRAVIS: Right; you need them both to be what we
are assuming is incredibly world-changing?

00:34:40.646 --> 00:34:44.657
SAM: That's a plan C or D, right? We're just going
to ask for a favor first.

00:34:44.657 --> 00:34:47.596
LIAM: I think so, yeah. That's a back-up plan.
Perhaps.

00:34:47.596 --> 00:34:49.288
TRAVIS: I'm just forwarding it out.

00:34:49.928 --> 00:34:52.262
SAM: Did you just say "I'm just Fjording it out?"

00:34:52.262 --> 00:34:53.765
TRAVIS: Just forwarding it out.

00:34:53.765 --> 00:34:56.093
SAM: Because please don't use your name
as a verb.

00:34:57.643 --> 00:34:59.472
TRAVIS: I'll Fjord you later for that.

00:34:59.902 --> 00:35:00.960
SAM: You will Nott.

00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:02.295
TALIESIN: Ooh.

00:35:03.585 --> 00:35:08.171
LIAM: In the meantime, I think that we should
acquire these beasts, get the training we need, in

00:35:08.171 --> 00:35:17.212
case we need to bug out of town as quickly as
possible. Do we know what this woman has in mind,

00:35:17.212 --> 00:35:18.382
or do we need to return?

00:35:18.382 --> 00:35:25.777
SAM: Yes, the two missions were as follows. for
5,000 gold pieces, we must root out an Empire spy

00:35:25.777 --> 00:35:37.334
in the Quadroads-- nope, Four Corners. Wrong
campaign. In the Four Corners. Find this Empire

00:35:37.334 --> 00:35:47.095
spy and throw them to the wolves. Or, for 10,000
gold or one favor, we must find the source of

00:35:47.095 --> 00:35:53.916
those rifts that we saw, the rift to the fiendish
plane. The Abyss? The Abyssal Plane? We must find

00:35:53.916 --> 00:35:56.811
the source of these rifts and shut it down.

00:35:57.261 --> 00:35:58.797
TRAVIS: Option number two.

00:35:58.797 --> 00:35:59.963
SAM: Go big or go home.

00:35:59.963 --> 00:36:04.150
LIAM: Right, we are talking about the favor, which
is not an option for the lower amount?

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:06.389
SAM: It was not an option for the lower amount.

00:36:06.389 --> 00:36:10.160
LIAM: Do they have any leads or anything to help,
or are we on our own for that?

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:17.695
SAM: The only lead was for the lower amount, the
spy. She gave us a location. For the rifts, no leads.

00:36:17.739 --> 00:36:21.247
LAURA: She said that's a good thing that we are
such good detectives.

00:36:21.247 --> 00:36:22.264
SAM: She's right.

00:36:22.264 --> 00:36:23.146
LAURA: Yeah.

00:36:23.856 --> 00:36:28.389
MARISHA: I wouldn't mind doing both jobs. I'm
curious as to who this spy is in general.

00:36:28.389 --> 00:36:33.587
TRAVIS: I wouldn't either, but what if it tugs on
certain party members' heartstrings, right? What

00:36:33.587 --> 00:36:38.291
if that spy is actually somebody that we're like,
"Oh, that's a good person, and we're going to hand

00:36:38.291 --> 00:36:39.536
"you over for your death."

00:36:39.536 --> 00:36:44.012
TALIESIN: Well, we've been presented with two
opportunities. I'm sure that leads will manifest,

00:36:44.012 --> 00:36:48.306
and we'll follow whatever leads manifest. That
will be what we're supposed to move towards.

00:36:48.306 --> 00:36:52.361
TRAVIS: We don't have to declare which one it is.
We just show up with results, right?

00:36:52.361 --> 00:36:53.221
SAM: That's right.

00:36:53.221 --> 00:36:54.080
TRAVIS: Fucking A.

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:58.552
LIAM: If we find the person they are looking for,
and it is someone that we do not want to hand

00:36:58.552 --> 00:36:59.728
over, we do not have to.

00:37:01.328 --> 00:37:06.183
TRAVIS: Who does multiple missions at the same
time? Only jackasses would go and take both job

00:37:06.183 --> 00:37:08.799
options at the same time in one outing, right?

00:37:08.799 --> 00:37:09.715
SAM: Yep.

00:37:09.715 --> 00:37:13.029
MARISHA: Subcontractor life? I don't-- it makes
sense to me.

00:37:14.359 --> 00:37:16.253
TRAVIS: The Gentleman. We did that before.

00:37:17.423 --> 00:37:18.994
MARISHA: Oh yeah, that's right.

00:37:18.994 --> 00:37:21.276
TRAVIS: Well, yeah. Let's go get some breakfast.

00:37:21.276 --> 00:37:24.112
LIAM: When is the last time you checked in with
Yeza?

00:37:25.152 --> 00:37:27.408
SAM: Remember last night, just before bed?

00:37:27.408 --> 00:37:29.147
LAURA: Oh yeah, that's right.

00:37:29.147 --> 00:37:31.326
SAM and LAURA: (warbling)

00:37:31.946 --> 00:37:32.960
MATT: I'll allow it.

00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:34.326
ALL: Yeah!

00:37:34.326 --> 00:37:38.934
(laughter)

00:37:38.934 --> 00:37:40.277
LAURA: What should I say?

00:37:42.945 --> 00:37:52.019
SAM: I mean, general update. Any sort of
markings, or have you been-- where are you?

00:37:52.019 --> 00:37:53.487
Where the fuck are you?!

00:37:53.611 --> 00:38:00.484
LAURA: Oh no, what if-- okay. I didn't mark my
long rest, so that's good. I'll see how many

00:38:00.484 --> 00:38:01.763
spells I have.

00:38:01.763 --> 00:38:08.499
LIAM: If there is any chance, one of these times--
even if it is not today-- he is alone and feels

00:38:08.499 --> 00:38:13.272
that he can speak, maybe ask if he knows what they
intend for him.

00:38:14.762 --> 00:38:17.477
LAURA: Right, yes. I'm going to do that for sure.

00:38:18.087 --> 00:38:19.092
SAM: Do that first.

00:38:19.092 --> 00:38:23.290
LAURA: Okay, yes. What do I do? Just go, "Hey, are
you alone? Can you speak? Because I need to ask

00:38:23.290 --> 00:38:24.430
"you some questions."

00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:26.428
SAM: Assume that he's alone and can speak.

00:38:26.428 --> 00:38:28.908
LAURA: Okay, cool. Hi.

00:38:31.258 --> 00:38:32.568
LIAM: That was the kickoff.

00:38:34.588 --> 00:38:35.745
LAURA: Um...

00:38:35.745 --> 00:38:40.253
(laughter)

00:38:40.253 --> 00:38:47.770
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck me! Please say "so" next,
or "like."

00:38:47.770 --> 00:38:51.768
LIAM: So, like, um... Hey, guys.

00:38:51.768 --> 00:38:54.250
MARISHA and SAM: I mean.

00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:58.091
TRAVIS: Oh Jesus. Saving husbands.

00:38:59.173 --> 00:39:00.400
MARISHA: Hey, internet!

00:39:01.385 --> 00:39:15.798
LAURA: Are there any prominent markings around
you? Do you think you'll be alone anytime? Do you

00:39:15.798 --> 00:39:18.354
know what they have planned for you?

00:39:23.836 --> 00:39:24.858
SAM: Holla!

00:39:24.858 --> 00:39:28.155
(laughter)

00:39:28.155 --> 00:39:29.433
LAURA: Holla at you!

00:39:36.602 --> 00:39:46.948
MATT: Yeza's voice comes through quietly and
whispered. "They're keeping me in a dark cell."

00:39:46.948 --> 00:39:48.973
LAURA: They're keeping him in a dark cell.

00:39:49.003 --> 00:39:55.884
MATT and LAURA: "Underground somewhere. No
interrogations yet."

00:39:55.884 --> 00:39:57.086
TRAVIS: That's good.

00:39:57.086 --> 00:39:59.185
MATT: "I don't know what they have planned."

00:39:59.185 --> 00:40:01.374
LAURA: He doesn't know what they have planned.

00:40:02.294 --> 00:40:03.875
MATT: "Holla... back?"

00:40:04.274 --> 00:40:06.658
LAURA: Oh, what's up! He said holla back!

00:40:06.658 --> 00:40:13.053
SAM: Ooh! Did you hear his masculine voice?

00:40:13.053 --> 00:40:14.910
LAURA: He's so manly.

00:40:14.910 --> 00:40:17.226
SAM: He is. He has the deepest voice in town.

00:40:17.226 --> 00:40:19.360
LAURA: Yeah, I could tell.

00:40:22.835 --> 00:40:27.859
SAM: Well, that's good! He's alive. Then they
haven't roughed him up or anything?

00:40:27.859 --> 00:40:32.456
LAURA: They literally just have him there, and
they haven't asked him anything. Oh, I should ask

00:40:32.456 --> 00:40:33.887
if he knows why they took him.

00:40:33.887 --> 00:40:35.458
SAM: Tomorrow morning, I suppose.

00:40:35.458 --> 00:40:37.646
LAURA: I can send again. I can call him again.

00:40:38.386 --> 00:40:41.387
SAM: Well, I did want to turn in soon, but sure.
Yeah, go ahead.

00:40:41.387 --> 00:40:52.907
LAURA: Okay, one more time. Hey Yeza, do you know
why they took you? Nott misses you so much. Keep

00:40:52.907 --> 00:40:59.407
those spirits up. Have you heard of the Traveler?
Hey!

00:41:06.927 --> 00:41:18.468
MATT: "I assume it has to do with me helping the
Assembly, working with that weird box thing.

00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:23.044
"I don't know who Nott is, but hi."

00:41:23.044 --> 00:41:24.494
LAURA: Oh, shit.

00:41:25.984 --> 00:41:27.855
MATT: "Are you still coming?"

00:41:28.198 --> 00:41:33.453
SAM: Oh no. What'd he say?

00:41:33.453 --> 00:41:38.370
LAURA: Number one, he said he thinks it's because
he's working with the Assembly; that's why they

00:41:38.370 --> 00:41:42.170
took him. He's been working with the weird
box thing.

00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:51.381
SAM: He was before, yes. Wait. Box thing. We only
saw the tripod where he was, so he--

00:41:51.391 --> 00:41:56.522
LAURA: Well, yeah, I'm assuming they took--
there's probably more than one of what we have. We

00:41:56.522 --> 00:42:01.221
should really see what that thing does hooked up
to the tripod. I wish that we could do it in a

00:42:01.221 --> 00:42:06.077
pocket dimension or something. Dang, I wish we had
the magic fun ball.

00:42:07.417 --> 00:42:12.827
Um... he said he misses you so much.

00:42:13.721 --> 00:42:18.918
And he said the Traveler sounds super duper cool.
Yeah.

00:42:21.695 --> 00:42:23.036
SAM: Good night!

00:42:23.987 --> 00:42:26.295
MATT and TRAVIS: (warbling)

00:42:26.295 --> 00:42:29.350
MATT: As they relay this information the following
morning.

00:42:31.965 --> 00:42:33.719
TRAVIS: I'm so hungry.

00:42:33.719 --> 00:42:36.845
LAURA: We should probably get going.

00:42:38.235 --> 00:42:44.065
MATT: You gather your things. Are you guys taking
on the same guises as you did the day before?

00:42:44.215 --> 00:42:46.305
LAURA: We should disguise ourselves again.

00:42:46.305 --> 00:42:48.189
TRAVIS: I'm going in like myself.

00:42:48.989 --> 00:42:50.795
MATT: You're going in straight, Fjord?

00:42:50.795 --> 00:42:52.594
TRAVIS: Yeah. Normal Fjord.

00:42:52.594 --> 00:42:54.805
MATT: All right.

00:42:55.065 --> 00:43:02.966
MARISHA: I think I'm going to go crazy, deranged
human this time. I don't want to have to keep

00:43:02.966 --> 00:43:05.464
burning people's spells just to walk around.

00:43:06.734 --> 00:43:08.239
LAURA: We'll see if it works.

00:43:09.178 --> 00:43:16.751
MARISHA: I flip my cloak inside out on the boring
side. Hide the coat. Roll around in the dirt. Mess

00:43:16.751 --> 00:43:17.857
up my hair.

00:43:19.097 --> 00:43:20.147
MATT: All right.

00:43:20.557 --> 00:43:26.205
LAURA: I put some makeup on to actually look goth,
but my clothes are still boring me.

00:43:26.519 --> 00:43:29.564
MARISHA: I take some eyeliner and black out a
couple teeth.

00:43:30.707 --> 00:43:32.985
MATT: Beau looks significantly crazed.

00:43:33.534 --> 00:43:35.667
LAURA: What about Caleb? What are you doing?

00:43:35.667 --> 00:43:44.045
LIAM: I repeat yesterday. I look like a male
version of Jester, not very goth. I take a bit of

00:43:44.045 --> 00:43:50.882
tallow and powdered iron, and rub it together, and
I smear it down the side of Beauregard's face.

00:43:50.882 --> 00:43:53.495
MARISHA: You did what? What is that? What'd you
just do?

00:43:53.495 --> 00:43:55.922
LIAM: You look good.

00:43:55.922 --> 00:43:57.928
LAURA: What did he do? What did you do?

00:43:57.928 --> 00:43:59.547
LIAM: I put some shit on her face.

00:43:59.547 --> 00:44:00.935
TRAVIS: That's bat droppings.

00:44:00.935 --> 00:44:05.378
LIAM: That's not bat droppings. It's just iron and
wax. Would you like some bat droppings?

00:44:05.378 --> 00:44:07.893
MARISHA: No, I'm-- actually, yeah, yeah.

00:44:07.893 --> 00:44:12.306
LIAM: I go into the right pocket. Here. It smells
a little bit, but it-- okay.

00:44:13.986 --> 00:44:16.795
MATT: Mark in your inventory, bat droppings. Go
for it.

00:44:16.795 --> 00:44:20.126
LIAM: Not all of my bat droppings, just a
significant amount.

00:44:20.126 --> 00:44:22.186
TRAVIS: "Not <i>all</i> my bat droppings!"

00:44:22.456 --> 00:44:24.198
TALIESIN: Saving that for later.

00:44:24.198 --> 00:44:28.677
MATT: Yeah. Guano hoarder up in here. All righty.
Preparing your things--

00:44:28.677 --> 00:44:30.348
LIAM: Got to find that minotaur.

00:44:31.308 --> 00:44:36.775
MATT: You begin your hike back towards Asarius.
You do notice that it looks maybe a third of the

00:44:36.775 --> 00:44:42.883
force that was gathering on the western side of
the city has moved on. It looks like the rest are

00:44:44.123 --> 00:44:49.922
preparing to move some point in the near future.
It looks like a lot more supplies are being put

00:44:49.922 --> 00:44:55.900
upon their various beasts of burden, the war
tortoises. The soldiers are beginning to bring all

00:44:55.900 --> 00:45:00.399
their arms together, sharpening their weapons,
preparing their caches of bolts.

00:45:00.942 --> 00:45:04.877
There's a general air and energy of
preparing to leave. You don't know how many of

00:45:04.877 --> 00:45:09.501
them are leaving, how many of them are staying;
you imagine they're going to want to have some for

00:45:09.501 --> 00:45:15.932
defense. You approach the outer wooden walls, into
the gates once more, the same ogres giving a nod.

00:45:16.432 --> 00:45:19.914
They give a brief stink eye to both Yasha and Beau
as they do.

00:45:21.994 --> 00:45:23.471
MARISHA: Hello, friend!

00:45:23.471 --> 00:45:25.804
LAURA: No, no, no! Don't talk!

00:45:25.954 --> 00:45:33.303
MATT: They look at each other, look back at her.
(laughing) "Stupid human!"

00:45:33.773 --> 00:45:34.814
MARISHA: It's true.

00:45:35.904 --> 00:45:37.469
MATT: Make a deception check.

00:45:43.479 --> 00:45:45.948
MARISHA: That was almost bad. 17.

00:45:45.948 --> 00:45:55.707
MATT: They feel more pity for you than wanting to
challenge, and that instinct slowly escapes them

00:45:55.707 --> 00:46:03.420
and their attention gets drawn elsewhere. You
enter the city streets, bustling as you recall,

00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:11.651
the smell itself strong, especially against the
clean morning cold air. That heavy waft of wet

00:46:11.651 --> 00:46:19.855
animal fur from multiple sources and that
long-standing layer of recently-returned-to-mud

00:46:19.855 --> 00:46:27.775
dung that lines the sides of the mud streets here.
You come upon the familiar parts of the city,

00:46:27.775 --> 00:46:34.541
passing the goblin district, passing by the
various other buildings and huts and hovels. Are

00:46:34.541 --> 00:46:36.804
you heading straight to Zorth's first?

00:46:36.804 --> 00:46:41.425
LIAM: I think that we should do that. I think we
should get that knocked out of the way in case we

00:46:41.425 --> 00:46:42.703
need to leave in a hurry.

00:46:43.823 --> 00:46:50.017
MATT: You approach. You can see from the outside
the familiar pen that is built around it. You hear

00:46:50.017 --> 00:46:54.654
growling, and two of the goblins are currently
holding down the sides of one of the moorbounders,

00:46:54.654 --> 00:47:01.814
and a third one that's coming up and gingerly trying
to feed it. As it brings its hands up, it throws a

00:47:01.814 --> 00:47:07.166
bunch of chunks of meat on the ground that slam
into it and tumble over themselves before they

00:47:07.166 --> 00:47:12.239
release the creature. It starts drastically eating
and throwing chunks everywhere. The goblins

00:47:12.239 --> 00:47:18.554
immediately scatter to the edge and close and lock
the door behind them on the inside. As you guys

00:47:18.554 --> 00:47:24.813
enter, the slight little bell (jingling) as you
push open the door, and you see the familiar older

00:47:24.813 --> 00:47:33.784
goblin face of Zorth there in the process of
gathering harnesses and a few somewhat

00:47:33.784 --> 00:47:40.822
rough-looking but functional saddles. Turns around
and notices you all and goes, "Oh, hello! It's

00:47:40.822 --> 00:47:43.656
"good to see you all! Did you sleep well?"

00:47:44.086 --> 00:47:51.742
SAM: We did, we did, Zorth. So well some of us might
appear different to you, but it's all of us again.

00:47:52.681 --> 00:47:57.402
MATT: "That's a confusing statement, but sure, it's
fine, now come on in here and learn how to ride!"

00:47:58.523 --> 00:48:00.384
LAURA: Yes, yes, yes!

00:48:00.794 --> 00:48:04.315
SAM: Yeah, are these lessons taught by you or--

00:48:04.315 --> 00:48:05.313
MATT: "Yeah!"

00:48:05.313 --> 00:48:09.217
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're ready. I want to feel the
thunder between my legs! Let's do it!

00:48:09.217 --> 00:48:17.573
LIAM: Do you not need-- when riding these
creatures, do you-- never mind, let's just see

00:48:17.573 --> 00:48:18.389
this lesson.

00:48:18.389 --> 00:48:19.647
SAM: Yes, yes.

00:48:20.477 --> 00:48:30.341
MATT: "Yeah." Leads you over to the interior of
the pen and there are now five of them inside this

00:48:30.341 --> 00:48:36.033
pen. Four of them are currently tethered to these
heavy, heavy metal stakes that are jammed who

00:48:36.033 --> 00:48:42.535
knows how deep in the ground by their thickness.
You can only imagine probably ten feet or more. As

00:48:42.725 --> 00:48:47.874
soon as you begin to approach the edge you can see
them all tense against the chains and (growling).

00:48:47.874 --> 00:48:49.632
TRAVIS: Good, good deal, good deal.

00:48:49.632 --> 00:48:50.779
SAM: We want these?

00:48:51.919 --> 00:48:58.378
MATT: The one that was previously being fed that
now has the two leather leash tethers dangling

00:48:58.378 --> 00:49:03.380
behind it as it's finishing off digging into the
mud and lifting up what remnants of the meal that

00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:08.321
was tossed toward it still remain before it turns
around to the rest of you and goes (growling). You

00:49:08.321 --> 00:49:13.556
can see now its snubbed snout with the exposed
nostrils flaring and expanding as it's taking in

00:49:13.556 --> 00:49:21.367
the scent of all of you approaching its space.
Zorth approaches, he goes: "Hey, hey! Dump, take

00:49:21.367 --> 00:49:27.078
"it down! It's all right, they're friends. Shh."
Brings his toe up to the front of his mouth.

00:49:27.078 --> 00:49:36.350
"Shh." They come up and actually, in a strange
display, it seems comparatively demure. It doesn't

00:49:36.350 --> 00:49:44.679
seem to like the other goblins, but Zorth it seems
to come to a trusted position with and sit right

00:49:44.679 --> 00:49:52.911
next to him. "And down!" It plops down and for the
first moment you're like, okay, there is something

00:49:52.911 --> 00:50:00.369
to this goblin's training. He looks around at you.
"So, we've got three of you. Three of you's going

00:50:00.369 --> 00:50:04.567
"to be learning how to ride these things. Could you
please tell me who it's going to be?"

00:50:04.567 --> 00:50:06.138
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, I want to be the first.

00:50:06.138 --> 00:50:07.571
MATT: "All right, that's one!"

00:50:07.571 --> 00:50:08.663
LAURA: Oh, me! And me!

00:50:08.663 --> 00:50:15.090
MATT: "Two! And three! All right, so we're going
to bind you to your respective creatures, so be

00:50:15.090 --> 00:50:17.896
"ready. Who's up first?"

00:50:18.386 --> 00:50:20.435
LIAM: I am the cat person in this group.

00:50:21.135 --> 00:50:25.602
MATT: For the three of you that are going to be
learning, it's going to be a few hours. This is

00:50:25.602 --> 00:50:30.705
essentially an individual-- for each of you--
skill challenge that's going to require a series

00:50:30.705 --> 00:50:35.411
of animal handling checks. If there are any spell
preparations you would like, you're free to.

00:50:35.411 --> 00:50:37.413
SAM: Anyone want to look into the dodeca?

00:50:37.413 --> 00:50:38.738
LAURA: Oh, we should Bless!

00:50:38.738 --> 00:50:40.687
MATT: Bless does not affect skill checks.

00:50:40.687 --> 00:50:41.447
LAURA: Shit!

00:50:41.447 --> 00:50:42.716
SAM: That's the dodeca.

00:50:42.716 --> 00:50:44.855
LIAM: I will take the dodeca.

00:50:45.665 --> 00:50:47.900
TRAVIS: Who has a low animal handling modifier?

00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:49.190
LAURA: I've got a good one.

00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:50.860
TALIESIN: I've got a good one, too.

00:50:50.860 --> 00:50:51.676
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:50:51.676 --> 00:50:56.277
LIAM: Okay, it's okay. I am comfortable with
cats.

00:50:58.077 --> 00:51:02.267
LAURA: Ah, is there nothing we can do? I mean,
Enhance Ability, right?

00:51:02.267 --> 00:51:03.939
MATT: That would be a way to do it.

00:51:03.939 --> 00:51:05.753
LAURA: But I don't have that prepared.

00:51:05.753 --> 00:51:14.899
MATT: Then it's not going to help you. So Caleb,
you first. The first aspect of the training is

00:51:14.899 --> 00:51:20.890
trust exercises, getting the creature comfortable
with you, with your scent, and beginning to see

00:51:20.890 --> 00:51:30.471
you as an equal, or a leader, or a master of
whatever your pact with it is. Zorth explains this

00:51:30.471 --> 00:51:35.401
in a cavalcade of various, somewhat obtuse
descriptors, but you get the gist of it.

00:51:35.971 --> 00:51:40.902
LIAM: While he's doing that, Frumpkin-- I bring
him to my shoulder and I have him start to pee

00:51:40.902 --> 00:51:45.280
subtly on my shoulders and hang out there.

00:51:45.810 --> 00:51:47.390
TRAVIS: Is that familiar urine?

00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:57.722
MATT: Famili-urine? It slowly soaks into the
shoulder. Zorth kind of, "It's--I would-- you--

00:51:59.182 --> 00:52:04.257
"anyway!" Continues on. Make your first animal
handling check as you begin to first approach and

00:52:04.262 --> 00:52:07.604
Zorth begins to help you with communion with this
creature.

00:52:07.604 --> 00:52:09.858
TRAVIS: Clerics on standby, clerics on standby!

00:52:09.858 --> 00:52:12.307
SAM: Come on, Caleb! Come on, Caleb!

00:52:12.457 --> 00:52:14.015
LAURA: You've got this, Caleb!

00:52:14.015 --> 00:52:17.732
LIAM: Good boys all around, hey? Kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty.

00:52:17.732 --> 00:52:19.683
SAM: Come on, show that pussy who's boss!

00:52:20.113 --> 00:52:21.653
LIAM: That is an 11.

00:52:21.791 --> 00:52:29.076
MATT: All right. It takes a bit of time, and there
are a few withdrawings of your hands, but then

00:52:29.076 --> 00:52:36.119
eventually there is a moment where it seems to
enable your touch. It begins to smell you, and

00:52:36.959 --> 00:52:43.331
Zorth begins to take the tether with one foot and
pull it over and down so its head is below yours,

00:52:43.331 --> 00:52:47.971
and telling you to rub the top of its head and
make eye contact. There's a whole ritual to this

00:52:47.971 --> 00:52:53.719
that seems to deal with a dominant position over
the creature and a point of trust. In a weird way

00:52:53.719 --> 00:52:59.684
you gain-- for as crazy as the instruction of
Zorth is, there's a renewed level of respect for

00:52:59.684 --> 00:53:03.770
the process that this goblin seems to have
mastered, whether trained or on its own.

00:53:03.770 --> 00:53:05.158
LIAM: That's a good boy.

00:53:05.298 --> 00:53:13.634
MATT: You do feel that a bond does come with the
creature, tenuous as it may be. Now, for the other

00:53:13.634 --> 00:53:16.061
two, I need you to also go through the same
process.

00:53:16.061 --> 00:53:19.361
TRAVIS: Can I ask, as Caleb is standing next to
these moo--

00:53:19.361 --> 00:53:20.389
MATT: Moorbounders.

00:53:20.389 --> 00:53:24.696
TRAVIS: Moorbounders. Where do they come up to us,
height-wise, from their backs?

00:53:24.696 --> 00:53:29.430
MATT: Height-wise, their shoulders, which is the
highest point of it, the sloped front all the way

00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:36.701
to the rear of the creature, the height, which is
the shoulder, would be almost a foot taller than you.

00:53:38.118 --> 00:53:39.560
SAM: Wait, how tall are you?

00:53:39.674 --> 00:53:42.221
TRAVIS: Six and change. These are big.

00:53:42.221 --> 00:53:45.768
LAURA: What the shit! I was picturing littles!

00:53:45.768 --> 00:53:49.487
TALIESIN: I had Battlecat from He-man in my head.
I had the whole--

00:53:49.487 --> 00:53:51.140
LAURA: Holy fuck, these are huge!

00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:52.867
MATT: Yeah, these are big creatures.

00:53:52.867 --> 00:53:54.487
TALIESIN: I'm pretty tall, though.

00:53:54.487 --> 00:53:56.170
TRAVIS: New mental pictures for me.

00:53:56.170 --> 00:54:00.738
MATT: Some of them are a little smaller, some are
a little bigger. You get a sense that there are

00:54:00.738 --> 00:54:05.407
variations in their age, and from what little
information you got from Zorth before, the ones

00:54:05.407 --> 00:54:11.931
that survive, survive because they weren't eaten
by the others. They're big creatures. That's also

00:54:11.931 --> 00:54:16.658
why they're expensive and utilized as war beasts.

00:54:16.868 --> 00:54:19.367
LAURA: Ooh, that's pretty cool. We've got war
beasts.

00:54:19.367 --> 00:54:23.480
TALIESIN: Skeletor's was the panther one? Panthor,
thank you.

00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:27.056
LIAM: That's the first thing that popped into my
head last week was Panthor.

00:54:27.056 --> 00:54:28.800
LAURA: Beau, Beau, Beau!

00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:29.735
MARISHA: Yeah?

00:54:29.735 --> 00:54:34.876
LAURA: Here, watch Nugget. Nugget, stay here.

00:54:34.876 --> 00:54:40.809
MATT: As soon as Nugget is passed over towards
Beau, you see the four tethered moorbounders

00:54:40.809 --> 00:54:43.189
(sniffing, growling).

00:54:43.189 --> 00:54:48.107
TALIESIN: Hey, hey, hey. That's not food.
They can understand me, by the way.

00:54:48.107 --> 00:54:49.099
MATT: They can.

00:54:49.099 --> 00:54:50.158
TALIESIN: Thank you.

00:54:50.948 --> 00:54:52.829
MATT: Make your animal handling check.

00:54:52.829 --> 00:54:54.923
TALIESIN: I'm Doctor Dolittle, motherfucker.

00:54:54.923 --> 00:54:58.482
TRAVIS: (laughs) "I'm Doctor Dolittle,
motherfucker!"

00:54:58.902 --> 00:54:59.757
SAM: Wow.

00:55:00.327 --> 00:55:02.859
LAURA: That's so bad, but it's 11, like Caleb.

00:55:02.859 --> 00:55:08.380
MATT: 11, okay. Similar process. The bonding takes
a little while, but eventually the moorbounder

00:55:08.380 --> 00:55:13.009
that's brought to you-- a little bit smaller than
the one that Caleb had, but still probably about

00:55:13.009 --> 00:55:19.390
six foot at full shoulder height, it's a thing you
have to climb onto-- seems to come to a point of

00:55:19.390 --> 00:55:20.672
tenuous trust.

00:55:21.502 --> 00:55:22.768
LAURA: He loves me!

00:55:24.858 --> 00:55:25.781
SAM: Tattoo him!

00:55:26.111 --> 00:55:27.818
TALIESIN: I know, so I--

00:55:27.818 --> 00:55:30.345
MATT: Strangely, you get the smallest of the
three.

00:55:30.345 --> 00:55:32.597
TALIESIN: I think we're going to be friends.

00:55:32.597 --> 00:55:34.578
LIAM: Like a clown on a tricycle?

00:55:36.588 --> 00:55:37.623
TALIESIN: 13.

00:55:37.873 --> 00:55:42.941
MATT: It comes up and (sniffs), and head butts
your palm.

00:55:42.941 --> 00:55:46.471
TALIESIN: Aww, hey.

00:55:46.841 --> 00:55:52.269
MATT: The second portion of this is going to
involve being able to give commands and being able

00:55:52.269 --> 00:55:59.491
to have it-- beyond just being a beast that
essentially-- what's the word I'm looking for--

00:55:59.491 --> 00:56:06.008
endures your presence, it'll actually, actively,
possibly take some commands. Beginning with you,

00:56:06.008 --> 00:56:10.094
Caleb, again, Zorth begins to show you--

00:56:10.094 --> 00:56:11.428
MARISHA: Actively, possibly.

00:56:11.828 --> 00:56:17.352
MATT: You're still working with beasts here. Shows
you, "All right, some of these creatures, you're

00:56:17.352 --> 00:56:22.183
"supposed to make sure that it not only trusts you
and respects you but, possibly, given the

00:56:22.183 --> 00:56:29.504
"situations, it can also do things for you? Come on,
try it out!" Make another animal handling check.

00:56:29.926 --> 00:56:39.663
LIAM: Okay. (singing) I like chicken, I like
liver, Meow Mix, Meow Mix, please deliver. 19.

00:56:41.118 --> 00:56:45.737
MATT: Over the next period of time, as the other
people start getting ready as well, there gets to

00:56:45.737 --> 00:56:52.373
be a modicum of your voice causing its-- it
doesn't even have ears that perk up more than it

00:56:52.373 --> 00:56:57.569
has these skin flaps that cover the side ear holes
behind its bulging eyes. You can see where they

00:56:57.569 --> 00:57:03.972
twitch and turn and whenever you begin to make the
simple commands of "jump." That's about as far as

00:57:03.972 --> 00:57:09.521
you get. Maybe down the road there could be other
ones, but it begins to perk up at the sound of

00:57:09.521 --> 00:57:11.328
your voice, and you watch as--

00:57:11.328 --> 00:57:12.172
LIAM: <i>Halt</i>.

00:57:13.142 --> 00:57:14.382
MATT: It sits.

00:57:15.722 --> 00:57:16.772
LIAM: Good boy.

00:57:17.132 --> 00:57:21.120
MATT: So you can offer the commands "halt" and
"jump."

00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:22.036
LIAM: Jump?

00:57:22.036 --> 00:57:26.773
MATT: Yeah. Those are the two that you have
capability of. Mind you, you still have to make

00:57:26.773 --> 00:57:31.203
an animal handling check to get them to follow
it, but you have the opportunity to do that.

00:57:32.283 --> 00:57:34.293
You two as well, same process.

00:57:35.533 --> 00:57:37.018
SAM: You got this, Jessie!

00:57:37.408 --> 00:57:39.387
LAURA: Yeah, of course, he loves me, so.

00:57:39.627 --> 00:57:41.690
SAM: You're great with animals and people.

00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:45.181
LAURA: 19!

00:57:45.181 --> 00:57:52.437
MATT: Following Caleb's lead quickly enough, you
get yours to also sit next to Caleb's moorbounder.

00:57:52.697 --> 00:57:53.562
Caduceus?

00:57:53.562 --> 00:57:58.227
TALIESIN: I'm going to use Thaumaturgy. I'm going
to look him in the eye, and I'm going to alter my

00:57:58.227 --> 00:58:08.864
eyes to mirror his. Give him a good look over.
All right. 11.

00:58:10.854 --> 00:58:14.466
MATT: You see it look you over. What do you
command it to do?

00:58:14.936 --> 00:58:16.098
TALIESIN: Sit.

00:58:17.118 --> 00:58:19.645
MATT: (slurps) and it licks up the side of your
cheek.

00:58:20.675 --> 00:58:22.311
TALIESIN: I mean, that'll do.

00:58:22.311 --> 00:58:27.786
MATT: It is a thick saliva that seems to tingle the
outside of your skin, but it is not listening to you.

00:58:27.914 --> 00:58:30.432
TALIESIN: He's so cute. I don't know.

00:58:31.092 --> 00:58:32.560
TRAVIS: Hard to be mad at it.

00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:33.450
TALIESIN: I know.

00:58:33.450 --> 00:58:34.741
MARISHA: Can't tell you no.

00:58:34.981 --> 00:58:39.684
MATT: For the third and final round that's going
to refine that process, Caleb, make your final

00:58:39.684 --> 00:58:40.734
animal handling check.

00:58:44.154 --> 00:58:45.004
LIAM: 19.

00:58:45.434 --> 00:58:46.647
MATT: 19, all right!

00:58:47.207 --> 00:58:48.377
LIAM: I'm a cat person.

00:58:48.377 --> 00:58:51.762
MATT: Indeed, and as part of that, whenever you
make those commands to it, you get to make the

00:58:51.762 --> 00:58:53.765
roll with advantage. So keep that in mind.

00:58:53.765 --> 00:58:55.388
MARISHA: That's good, that's good.

00:58:55.388 --> 00:58:57.004
SAM: What were the commands again?

00:58:57.004 --> 00:58:57.987
LIAM: <i>Halt und</i> jump.

00:58:57.987 --> 00:58:59.483
MATT: Yep, halt and jump.

00:58:59.483 --> 00:59:00.362
LIAM: Okay.

00:59:00.362 --> 00:59:01.197
MATT: Jester?

00:59:01.197 --> 00:59:02.645
TRAVIS: Just like Red Dead.

00:59:04.785 --> 00:59:06.984
LAURA: Okay, 16.

00:59:07.484 --> 00:59:11.670
MATT: You as well manage to succeed in this
process. While the two of you are with flying

00:59:11.670 --> 00:59:16.383
colors, all of a sudden there's a very, very faint
beginnings of a bond with these moorbounders, you

00:59:16.383 --> 00:59:19.430
look over at Caduceus, who's having a little bit
of a rough time.

00:59:19.430 --> 00:59:20.643
TALIESIN: I'm having fun!

00:59:20.643 --> 00:59:25.163
MATT: Of the other two that seem to be a little
more hunter, predatory ones, Caduceus got paired

00:59:25.163 --> 00:59:29.021
with one that seems a little more
playful-kitten-like. It's the youngest of all of

00:59:29.021 --> 00:59:33.877
them, which also makes it a little hard for it to
pay attention. Make your final animal handling check.

00:59:33.877 --> 00:59:35.781
TRAVIS: Come on, Caduceus, you got this!

00:59:35.781 --> 00:59:36.571
TALIESIN: 15.

00:59:36.571 --> 00:59:42.163
MATT: That succeeds, so you've earned the ability
now to at least give these commands, but you do

00:59:42.163 --> 00:59:43.723
not gain the advantage as well.

00:59:43.723 --> 00:59:49.005
TRAVIS: If we haven't gained the commands, would
they have taken off fucking running, never come back?

00:59:49.220 --> 00:59:54.427
MATT: It would've meant that they-- you don't know
how they act. You could've got them going, but

00:59:54.427 --> 00:59:57.569
getting them to stop was going to be a very
interesting experience.

00:59:57.569 --> 01:00:01.145
TALIESIN: I do, to be fair, have the spell
Command, so worst-case scenario--

01:00:01.145 --> 01:00:03.860
MATT: Worst-case scenario, you have that at your
disposal.

01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:08.438
TALIESIN: I can actually give a one-word command
to mine, and it'd be forced to obey me at least.

01:00:08.438 --> 01:00:10.584
TRAVIS: You would never do that to us, right?

01:00:10.584 --> 01:00:15.193
LAURA: If we would have rolled really well on the
first roll, would we have to even do the checks?

01:00:15.193 --> 01:00:21.017
MATT: Yeah. It was a growing DC with each check to
see how well you bonded in this first three-hour

01:00:21.017 --> 01:00:27.275
session with the creature. Completing it, Zorth
looks around at all of you. "I'm not going to lie,

01:00:27.275 --> 01:00:32.434
"I'm really impressed. That was amazing. Obviously,
I've been doing this for a very long time, and I

01:00:32.434 --> 01:00:37.108
"haven't seen anyone bond quite that quick. That
was incredible. Really blown away. That was

01:00:37.108 --> 01:00:42.724
"incredible. Well, I'll go and get my boys. We'll
get these all suited up and ready to go."

01:00:43.404 --> 01:00:47.642
SAM: Zorth, what are they called? What are these
called? Do they have names, these creatures?

01:00:47.642 --> 01:00:50.733
MATT: "That's not my prerogative. They're
moorbounders. You get to name your beasts; you

01:00:50.733 --> 01:00:53.599
"bought them. Which, by the way, where's your
coin?"

01:00:54.039 --> 01:00:56.067
SAM and LIAM: Oh, yes.

01:00:56.067 --> 01:00:57.538
MARISHA: How much was it? 500?

01:00:57.538 --> 01:01:02.304
SAM: I think it was 400? 300? It was 600.

01:01:02.304 --> 01:01:03.404
LAURA: It was 600?

01:01:03.404 --> 01:01:04.735
SAM: It was 600 plus a dick.

01:01:04.735 --> 01:01:06.262
LAURA: Oh, I thought it was 500.

01:01:06.262 --> 01:01:07.649
TALIESIN: That's a good deal.

01:01:08.569 --> 01:01:10.003
LAURA: Was it? Or was it--

01:01:10.003 --> 01:01:10.909
TRAVIS: 600.

01:01:11.009 --> 01:01:12.925
MARISHA: 600 and a dick statue.

01:01:13.825 --> 01:01:15.365
TRAVIS: Which he has, I'm sure.

01:01:15.365 --> 01:01:19.943
MATT: Yes. You've already given the dick statue,
which is sitting on the edge of the table at the

01:01:19.943 --> 01:01:25.934
front where you saw him handling things. He's very
proud of its display. It's central to the arrival process.

01:01:25.934 --> 01:01:30.405
TALIESIN: I will admit, I do want an insight
check. Did we actually do better than most people,

01:01:30.405 --> 01:01:32.116
or is he just being very, very nice?

01:01:32.116 --> 01:01:33.456
MATT: Make an insight check.

01:01:33.456 --> 01:01:37.606
TALIESIN: That's an 18. Okay, okay. I'm into it.

01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:45.757
SAM: D&amp;D Beyond. We have the new overlay, guys. I
haven't seen it because I can't watch this show,

01:01:45.757 --> 01:01:46.758
because I'm on it.

01:01:46.758 --> 01:01:52.079
MARISHA: It's great. We built our overlay so it
doesn't interact with their overlay.

01:01:52.079 --> 01:01:53.030
LAURA: That's cool.

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:54.480
TRAVIS: How'd we do?

01:01:55.750 --> 01:02:00.811
TALIESIN: All right. (laughs) We did great.

01:02:01.501 --> 01:02:04.749
MARISHA: I have 270, so I don't mind tossing in a
hundred gold.

01:02:04.749 --> 01:02:06.319
LAURA: I could toss in a hundred.

01:02:07.389 --> 01:02:12.606
LIAM: I have these two jade stones. They're worth
a hundred each. I will contribute them.

01:02:12.606 --> 01:02:13.898
TALIESIN: I'm coin-light.

01:02:13.898 --> 01:02:15.333
MARISHA: I am coin-light, too.

01:02:15.333 --> 01:02:16.812
TRAVIS: I can put in a hundred.

01:02:16.812 --> 01:02:18.148
LIAM: What's the total, six?

01:02:18.148 --> 01:02:19.859
SAM: I can put in 200 if we need to.

01:02:19.859 --> 01:02:21.338
LAURA: We're at 500 now.

01:02:21.338 --> 01:02:24.470
SAM: How's Yasha? How's Yasha look on coin?

01:02:24.470 --> 01:02:26.171
MARISHA: How does she look on coin?

01:02:26.171 --> 01:02:30.819
TRAVIS: I may have been forgetting to put money in
her shit. Nope. No, she's got stuff. She can go

01:02:30.819 --> 01:02:32.861
for 50. We'll both put in 50.

01:02:32.861 --> 01:02:35.149
SAM: Maybe Yasha should pay for the whole thing.

01:02:35.149 --> 01:02:37.439
TRAVIS: Yasha's good to put down a hundred gold.

01:02:37.439 --> 01:02:41.829
MATT: Yasha grips the handle of The Magician's
Judge and looks at you.

01:02:43.279 --> 01:02:45.450
LIAM: What's the tally here? Two from me.

01:02:45.450 --> 01:02:49.579
SAM: Are you okay to part with these jade
baubles?

01:02:49.579 --> 01:02:51.061
LIAM: Look at this cat.

01:02:51.061 --> 01:02:53.768
LAURA: Yeah, but he might only take coin.

01:02:53.768 --> 01:03:00.795
LIAM: These are worth at least 150 each, but I
will give them to you as part of this deal.

01:03:00.795 --> 01:03:02.239
MATT: Reaches the foot out--

01:03:03.279 --> 01:03:06.238
LIAM: There's one. Oh, here. Both of them for you.

01:03:06.238 --> 01:03:10.710
MATT: Then hops over to the front desk and pulls
out a small eyepiece and looks through, and is

01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:17.839
like, "Hmm. Hmm!"

01:03:19.009 --> 01:03:20.651
LIAM: Don't forget, it's his foot.

01:03:22.921 --> 01:03:24.469
MATT: "Yeah. I'll take it."

01:03:25.569 --> 01:03:29.363
SAM: That's 200 right there? Wait, is it 300 or
200, Zorth?

01:03:29.363 --> 01:03:30.564
MATT: You said it was...?

01:03:30.564 --> 01:03:32.242
LIAM: 150 each. That's what I said.

01:03:32.242 --> 01:03:35.861
MATT: 150 each? Okay, I'll allow it. I thought you
said a hundred originally.

01:03:35.861 --> 01:03:37.676
LIAM: I know that. I'm lying, Matthew.

01:03:37.676 --> 01:03:40.635
MATT: Oh, you--? Then it is 200, yeah? Or are you
going for it?

01:03:40.635 --> 01:03:44.457
LIAM: I'm lying to this armless goblin. Not to you
because you know everything.

01:03:44.457 --> 01:03:45.913
MATT: Make a deception check.

01:03:45.913 --> 01:03:51.444
LIAM: Okay. That is a 17.

01:03:58.964 --> 01:04:03.910
MATT: "These are some pretty nice gems, not going
to lie. Pretty nice. Pretty shiny. Nice and pretty

01:04:03.910 --> 01:04:06.966
"little baubles. 100 gold each."

01:04:09.063 --> 01:04:10.188
LIAM: Deal. Deal.

01:04:10.188 --> 01:04:11.368
SAM: That's 200.

01:04:11.518 --> 01:04:14.289
TRAVIS, MARISHA, and SAM: I'll put in a hundred.

01:04:14.289 --> 01:04:16.492
LAURA: Hundred. That's everything?

01:04:16.492 --> 01:04:17.841
SAM: That's everything.

01:04:17.841 --> 01:04:21.248
MATT: "Fantastic! You want them now? I can go and
get them ready to go."

01:04:21.688 --> 01:04:23.325
LIAM: What do these beasts eat?

01:04:25.045 --> 01:04:31.809
MATT: "Pretty much whatever you put in front of
them that was once living. Meats, leathers,

01:04:31.809 --> 01:04:33.793
"jerkies, critters."

01:04:37.953 --> 01:04:41.716
LAURA: We have to keep them away from the animals,
or at least--

01:04:42.576 --> 01:04:48.583
LIAM: What about more intelligent fare? Someone
like me? People, elves?

01:04:48.593 --> 01:04:53.219
MARISHA: Like those of us that didn't go through
your seminar. Is it going to eat our faces in the

01:04:53.219 --> 01:04:54.180
middle of the night?

01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:58.937
MATT: "Not as long as you keep them fed. If you're
not feeding them, maybe not be sleeping near them,

01:04:58.937 --> 01:05:00.181
"if you know what I mean."

01:05:00.181 --> 01:05:03.759
TRAVIS: Well, I see you've made saddles for them.
You got any muzzles?

01:05:04.189 --> 01:05:05.221
MATT: "What?"

01:05:06.181 --> 01:05:09.883
TRAVIS: Yeah, why-- what a dumb question. I don't
know what I was thinking.

01:05:09.883 --> 01:05:14.863
LAURA: I take my ribbon off of my horn
and go and tie it on the collar of mine.

01:05:15.513 --> 01:05:17.203
Or the saddle, so it's pretty.

01:05:17.203 --> 01:05:23.832
MATT: Okay. So, you have your three prepared.
Saddles at the ready. You can take them now, if

01:05:23.832 --> 01:05:25.970
you want to bring them through the city, or--

01:05:25.970 --> 01:05:26.877
TRAVIS: Nope, nope.

01:05:26.877 --> 01:05:28.699
MATT: They can be held on to, until you wish to
take them.

01:05:28.699 --> 01:05:30.133
TRAVIS: I think that's better.

01:05:30.133 --> 01:05:30.903
LAURA: Yeah.

01:05:30.903 --> 01:05:35.674
LIAM: I walk forward, I place my hand on the neck
of my largest beast, and say, I will be back for

01:05:35.674 --> 01:05:38.830
you later, Jannik. Good boy.

01:05:40.110 --> 01:05:41.575
MATT: Jannik? All right.

01:05:41.575 --> 01:05:42.439
LIAM: <i>Halt</i>.

01:05:46.019 --> 01:05:47.674
SAM: What will you say to yours?

01:05:47.674 --> 01:05:50.303
LAURA: I will be back for you later, Yarnball.

01:05:50.303 --> 01:05:51.794
MARISHA: (laughing) Yarnball?

01:05:51.794 --> 01:05:53.376
MATT: Jannik, Yarnball...

01:05:54.906 --> 01:05:56.192
TALIESIN: Hmm.

01:05:57.052 --> 01:05:59.224
MATT: (huffing)

01:05:59.224 --> 01:06:01.362
LIAM: We've got a theme going here, Caduceus.

01:06:01.362 --> 01:06:03.116
MARISHA: Yandi's already been taken.

01:06:03.116 --> 01:06:05.073
TALIESIN: What's the theme? I don't know.

01:06:05.073 --> 01:06:09.690
TRAVIS: We've got Jannik and Yarnball, but you be
you. You do you.

01:06:09.690 --> 01:06:12.085
MARISHA: Yandi is an alpaca in another dimension.

01:06:12.085 --> 01:06:13.902
LIAM: Yuduyu is a good name.

01:06:14.222 --> 01:06:16.232
TALIESIN: I'm so confused about the theme.

01:06:16.782 --> 01:06:21.464
MATT: (snuffling, snort)

01:06:21.464 --> 01:06:23.218
TALIESIN: Yeah, you're a Clarabelle.

01:06:23.248 --> 01:06:27.292
(laughter)

01:06:27.292 --> 01:06:31.609
MATT: Jannik, Yarnball, and Clarabelle have been
decreed.

01:06:31.609 --> 01:06:32.840
MARISHA: That's so cute.

01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:36.904
TALIESIN: Thank you. That's my sister. She's
weird, too.

01:06:37.124 --> 01:06:40.035
TRAVIS: You named your moorbounder after your
sister?

01:06:41.927 --> 01:06:46.012
MARISHA: Wait, does the moorbounder remind you
of your sister? Or does your sister remind you

01:06:46.012 --> 01:06:47.583
of the moorbounder?

01:06:47.583 --> 01:06:50.152
TALIESIN: I'm not entirely sure what the
difference is?

01:06:50.152 --> 01:06:51.642
MARISHA: That's a fair point.

01:06:51.782 --> 01:06:56.263
MATT: All right. "So, pick them up when you're
ready. We'll keep them until then. But, a couple

01:06:56.263 --> 01:07:00.683
"days later, if you don't show up, I'm going to
have to assume you're not picking them up, and

01:07:00.683 --> 01:07:02.066
"they're back on the market."

01:07:02.066 --> 01:07:10.394
SAM: Is there a place around here that-- free
trade of information-- like a pub or a central hub of--

01:07:10.394 --> 01:07:11.459
TALIESIN: Breakfast.

01:07:11.459 --> 01:07:12.444
SAM: --breakfast.

01:07:12.446 --> 01:07:17.437
MATT: "I mean, your best bet's probably going to
the Scowl Square. That's where they've got a lot

01:07:17.437 --> 01:07:25.719
"of purveyors of food, and there's one big old pub
there called the Four Corners. That's where Madam

01:07:25.719 --> 01:07:33.067
"Musk's is. That's where Timoch and Ude Make Things.
That's where Barron's Meats is, big old butchery."

01:07:37.117 --> 01:07:42.101
TALIESIN: Ms. Nott, you also wanted to inquire at
some point about the character of our employer?

01:07:42.471 --> 01:07:45.396
SAM: Yes. I didn't know if-- Hey.

01:07:45.396 --> 01:07:46.415
MATT: "Hey!"

01:07:47.345 --> 01:07:52.438
SAM: Zorthy, what's the word on the street about
this Lady Zethris Oleos?

01:07:52.808 --> 01:07:54.755
MATT: "Oh, she's spooky, that one."

01:07:54.855 --> 01:08:01.497
SAM: Spooky, like you can't trust her? Or spooky
like you can trust her, and that's a bad thing.

01:08:01.497 --> 01:08:11.889
MATT: "No. She's just very-- she's a lot! She's
very pretty, and she's surrounded by a lot of

01:08:11.889 --> 01:08:24.948
"people. And very powerful. It's just I don't really
go mingle with them political folk so much. So--"

01:08:24.948 --> 01:08:27.369
LIAM: Does she come down from her tower much?

01:08:27.799 --> 01:08:31.926
MATT: "I don't see it too often. But then again,
I'm usually pretty busy with all these

01:08:31.926 --> 01:08:36.874
(yelling) "jackasses!" You see the other goblins around
the corner playing a card game and they go (eek).

01:08:36.877 --> 01:08:40.780
They go back and scramble to go ahead and start feeding
the rest of the moorbounders in the pen.

01:08:40.780 --> 01:08:42.980
LAURA: Are a lot of people scared of her?

01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:45.911
MATT: "I don't-- maybe? I don't know."

01:08:45.911 --> 01:08:49.142
LAURA: Okay. Hey man, I have a question!

01:08:49.142 --> 01:08:51.109
MATT: "Well, what is the question?"

01:08:51.109 --> 01:08:56.615
LAURA: Have you seen a lot of other places that
have, like, the rifts like you had in your store?

01:08:56.615 --> 01:09:01.761
Have you heard of anything? Any other goblins
talking about, "Oh man, you should have seen these

01:09:01.761 --> 01:09:03.820
"things that came out of this slit."

01:09:03.820 --> 01:09:05.661
TALIESIN: Anything strange going on?

01:09:05.661 --> 01:09:06.482
MATT: "No!"

01:09:06.482 --> 01:09:08.140
LAURA: Cool.

01:09:08.140 --> 01:09:12.512
SAM: We'll be back to collect our beasts.

01:09:12.512 --> 01:09:18.030
MATT: "Fantastic! I'll be here. Thank you so much
for your patronage! Fine beasts you've acquired.

01:09:18.030 --> 01:09:19.582
"You'll be really happy."

01:09:19.582 --> 01:09:21.714
SAM: We are.

01:09:21.714 --> 01:09:23.196
MARISHA: Thanks. Yeah.

01:09:23.196 --> 01:09:24.830
TRAVIS: That could have gone much worse.

01:09:24.830 --> 01:09:26.821
SAM: Whew. Good job.

01:09:26.821 --> 01:09:28.111
MARISHA: I'm proud of you all.

01:09:28.111 --> 01:09:36.068
LIAM: Now, Jannik is number two cat. You are
number one. You are in charge. You just... dress

01:09:36.068 --> 01:09:37.230
to impress, okay?

01:09:37.230 --> 01:09:42.894
TRAVIS: Do you think Jannik has more, you know,
constitution than number one cat?

01:09:42.894 --> 01:09:48.712
MARISHA: Do you think he puffs into glitter when
he's punted? (chuckles)

01:09:48.712 --> 01:09:52.844
LIAM: He does not have half the heart as my cat,
thank you very much.

01:09:52.844 --> 01:09:55.929
MARISHA: No, but half the constitution for sure.

01:09:55.929 --> 01:10:01.112
MATT: General notes for moorbounders, just so you
have them. This is their stats sheet.

01:10:01.112 --> 01:10:03.394
LIAM: (imitating Zorth) Yeah, pass it down!

01:10:03.394 --> 01:10:06.060
TALIESIN &amp; SAM: Ooh.

01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:07.513
LAURA: I'm going to take a picture.

01:10:07.513 --> 01:10:09.862
TALIESIN: I'm going to put it in my little
creature notebook.

01:10:09.862 --> 01:10:14.498
TRAVIS: I hate to insist, but can we please get
some food? I'm fucking starving.

01:10:14.498 --> 01:10:15.775
TALIESIN: I am hungry.

01:10:15.775 --> 01:10:19.328
TRAVIS: Can we make our way over to the Scowl
Square?

01:10:19.328 --> 01:10:25.894
MATT: Certainly. Continuing on into the center of
the town, you pass by the Aurora Hold tower, where

01:10:25.894 --> 01:10:30.921
you guys had previously ventured. The guard, well
placed. There's a lot of in and out of the

01:10:30.921 --> 01:10:37.191
facility as different Kryn soldiers or generals
are in the process of whatever transition is

01:10:37.191 --> 01:10:43.181
happening to the western side of the city. Moving
on and asking a few questions, you eventually find

01:10:43.181 --> 01:10:50.585
yourself at the Scowl Square. It's this large
cross-point where two of the major roads meet, and

01:10:50.585 --> 01:10:55.764
a series of small alleys all come to an
asterisk-looking center point, a little ways north

01:10:55.764 --> 01:11:05.544
beyond where the Aurora Hold was. Here in this
space, there's a center patch of grass: a dull,

01:11:05.544 --> 01:11:17.061
dark gray-green grass and a singular tree. Around
this, there are small tents and tables set up,

01:11:17.061 --> 01:11:25.242
with people that have gathered a number of roots
or other hardier plant life that you had seen

01:11:25.242 --> 01:11:31.266
being harvested outside, in baskets and bags to be
sold to whoever's passing by, or traded for.

01:11:31.266 --> 01:11:33.313
MARISHA: Farmer's market?

01:11:33.313 --> 01:11:41.514
MATT: Kind of a farmer's market feel, but on a
smaller scale. A very unique variety of people

01:11:41.514 --> 01:11:51.793
making these sales. You see a black-scaled
dragonborn with very broad shoulders and tiny,

01:11:51.793 --> 01:11:58.856
almost chicken-thin legs, that is in the process
of cutting up some very large, but strange-looking

01:11:58.856 --> 01:12:05.585
fish, apparently filleting them on a shelf.
Looking past that, you can see a long piece of

01:12:05.585 --> 01:12:13.123
laundry string that's wrapped between two poles.
Hanging from it are a number of small,

01:12:13.123 --> 01:12:19.391
squirrel-like creatures that have been hunted and
stripped and jerky made of their flesh; as well as

01:12:19.391 --> 01:12:27.337
bits of fur being put together into a large pelt
by a small goblin creature. Looks comparable in

01:12:27.337 --> 01:12:35.032
age to Zorth, but female; and is, with this giant
needle, knitting all these pelts together.

01:12:35.032 --> 01:12:39.845
Occasionally piercing a finger while not really
paying attention, then getting caught halfway

01:12:39.845 --> 01:12:47.345
through and having to undo it, and unstitch her
own finger. You do see a barn, this large L-shaped

01:12:47.345 --> 01:12:53.233
barn on the northwest side of the square, but it
has a sign hanging out front that says "Four

01:12:53.233 --> 01:13:03.245
"Corners". There's a smokestack, a space for a
kitchen on the outer left side of the structure,

01:13:03.245 --> 01:13:08.637
little bit of smoke coming up. The door is part
way open, and there's a bustling tavern on the

01:13:08.637 --> 01:13:16.729
interior. Looking around, you make a perception
check for me, if you don't mind. You as well.

01:13:16.729 --> 01:13:23.484
TALIESIN: 16. Rolling middle-y today.

01:13:23.484 --> 01:13:27.101
MARISHA: Damn it. Fucking piece of shit: eight.

01:13:27.101 --> 01:13:31.932
MATT: Okay. And actually, Jester, you as well.

01:13:32.501 --> 01:13:37.238
LAURA: Yay! No! I think that's like a 10.

01:13:37.238 --> 01:13:45.453
MATT: Okay. This is just a wide variety of
salespeople around here, but a lot of it just

01:13:45.453 --> 01:13:51.585
seems to be general goods, scattered around. You
do see there are a few places that have at least

01:13:51.585 --> 01:13:55.929
names attached to them, some of the huts or nearby
buildings, those seem to be more prominent

01:13:55.929 --> 01:14:02.890
businesses here. It's unique. Having been in a lot
of the central Empire cities, this city seems to

01:14:02.890 --> 01:14:09.476
be trying to build or create a semblance of that
same type of civilization, but has a unique

01:14:09.476 --> 01:14:19.340
roughness to it that is both charmingly rustic and
laced with a perpetual sense of danger. You do see

01:14:19.340 --> 01:14:24.633
there is a craft store that you heard mentioned
before called Timoch and Ude Make Things.

01:14:24.633 --> 01:14:27.316
TRAVIS: Timoch and Ude?

01:14:27.316 --> 01:14:29.918
MATT: Timoch and Ude Make Things.

01:14:29.918 --> 01:14:31.728
MARISHA: Sounds like an Etsy store.

01:14:31.728 --> 01:14:35.089
SAM: Tim and Eric make a movie?

01:14:35.089 --> 01:14:44.340
MATT: There is a heavy, thatched hut that sits on
the far eastern side just beyond where the road

01:14:44.340 --> 01:14:54.039
stops, tucked between a few buildings, and this
tiny grove where elements of dry reeds seem to be

01:14:54.039 --> 01:14:59.268
gathering and almost weaving up into a weird alien
ivy that coasts over the outside of this hut.

01:14:59.268 --> 01:15:06.460
MATT: You glance over in that direction. You can
see a small banner of cloth that is haphazardly

01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:08.781
painted that says "Madame Musk's."

01:15:08.781 --> 01:15:14.762
TALIESIN: Well, you're an interesting ivy. You
local?

01:15:14.762 --> 01:15:18.460
MARISHA: Are you hitting on the ivy, Caduceus?

01:15:18.460 --> 01:15:23.633
TALIESIN: Well, I mean, it's just that this is a
surprising plant to find out in the middle of nowhere.

01:15:23.633 --> 01:15:25.000
TRAVIS: Still sounds like he's hitting on it.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:25.984
MARISHA: Yeah, it does.

01:15:25.984 --> 01:15:28.418
TRAVIS: "Are you local? Surprising to
find you here."

01:15:28.418 --> 01:15:29.831
MARISHA: What brought you here?

01:15:29.831 --> 01:15:30.932
TRAVIS: Been here long?

01:15:30.932 --> 01:15:32.050
MARISHA: Fancy crossing paths.

01:15:32.050 --> 01:15:33.259
TRAVIS: Come with anybody?

01:15:33.259 --> 01:15:34.698
MARISHA: Like ships in the night.

01:15:34.698 --> 01:15:36.380
MATT: There is also the last--

01:15:36.380 --> 01:15:40.145
(laughter)

01:15:40.145 --> 01:15:44.111
MATT: As you're trying to understand what they're
saying to you, you look past and come into focus.

01:15:44.111 --> 01:15:50.796
You can also see on the western side of the square
one building that is a very busy butchery. You can

01:15:50.796 --> 01:15:55.286
see a number of other nondescript creatures.
You're uncertain of the origins, because they've

01:15:55.286 --> 01:16:01.638
all mainly been torn of skin, and are just hanging
sacks of meat carcasses that are up on hooks,

01:16:01.638 --> 01:16:12.179
hanging in a window display. There is an ogre in a
nice, silk shirt with a ruffle across the neck and

01:16:12.179 --> 01:16:18.015
shoulder area, that is in the process of carving
through, and preparing, large slabs of meat.

01:16:18.015 --> 01:16:21.948
TALIESIN: Do any of the hanging carcasses look like
the things that we killed in the basement recently?

01:16:21.948 --> 01:16:25.583
MATT: You probably have to get a closer
look to it.

01:16:25.583 --> 01:16:31.048
TALIESIN: I'm going to head in that direction. I'm going
to just veer right off that comment to the butcher.

01:16:31.048 --> 01:16:37.670
MATT: Okay. Right in front of you at this space,
you can see there is one large gnoll that is in

01:16:37.670 --> 01:16:43.015
the process of holding a list and looks like he's
running errands for other individuals and is

01:16:43.015 --> 01:16:49.755
growling as they're trying to make out the
handwriting and speaking in gnoll to the ogre

01:16:49.755 --> 01:16:59.323
who's like, "Just wait your turn." Finishes up
cutting a series of slabs for a group of three

01:16:59.323 --> 01:17:04.482
goblins that have a small cart, and they go and
pay off the remainder of the slabs, and pull them

01:17:04.482 --> 01:17:09.282
down and put them on the cart, and two of them
grab the front parts of the cart and one jumps in

01:17:09.282 --> 01:17:14.433
the back and slaps the right one on the shoulder
and then (squeaking) the cart begins to wheel off

01:17:14.433 --> 01:17:20.052
in the southern side of the square, out of sight.
The gnoll goes up and makes its order. As you're

01:17:20.052 --> 01:17:22.281
keeping an eye out, make a medicine check.

01:17:22.281 --> 01:17:26.319
TALIESIN: 28. Natural 20.

01:17:26.319 --> 01:17:28.137
MARISHA: Whoa.

01:17:28.137 --> 01:17:29.817
TALIESIN: Had to happen eventually.

01:17:29.817 --> 01:17:36.437
MATT: Looking at the structure of the various
corpses that hang from the front of this

01:17:36.437 --> 01:17:41.042
establishment, none of them match the creature
that you had fought the day before. Most of them

01:17:41.042 --> 01:17:52.355
seem to be either aurochs that you'd seen kept as
beasts of burden in the area; deer--

01:17:52.355 --> 01:17:53.569
TALIESIN: Nothing unusual.

01:17:53.569 --> 01:18:02.082
MATT: Nothing unusual, and a couple of slabs
that look to be almost a young moorbounder.

01:18:02.082 --> 01:18:06.492
The meat itself is a little darker and
looks a lot tougher.

01:18:06.492 --> 01:18:08.801
TALIESIN: Makes sense.

01:18:08.801 --> 01:18:10.118
TRAVIS: Too early.

01:18:10.118 --> 01:18:17.980
MATT: The gnoll's packages are completed and sent
off. The ogre sits back and takes his hands and

01:18:17.980 --> 01:18:26.546
puts it in a basin of water and wipes it and looks
over at you. "We-- er." Reaches into a pocket and

01:18:26.546 --> 01:18:34.809
pulls out a monocle. "I haven't seen someone like
you around. What's this about?"

01:18:34.809 --> 01:18:42.039
TALIESIN: Oh, my apologies. I'm not local, and I'm
just very impressed by your operation and

01:18:42.039 --> 01:18:50.436
honestly, I was just curious what kind of animals
you butcher here. We were on the lookout for some

01:18:50.436 --> 01:18:56.697
unusual creatures that might have been popping up
lately. Things that don't necessarily belong here,

01:18:56.697 --> 01:18:58.369
or shouldn't be around here.

01:18:58.369 --> 01:19:04.023
MATT: "Well... I mean, it's meat."

01:19:04.023 --> 01:19:07.750
TRAVIS: (laughing)

01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:12.331
TALIESIN: And fabulous meat it is. Where are
my manners, by the way, I'm so sorry.

01:19:12.331 --> 01:19:14.249
What was your name again?

01:19:14.249 --> 01:19:16.987
MATT: "My name is Baron Visco."

01:19:16.987 --> 01:19:18.792
TALIESIN: Baron Visco.

01:19:18.792 --> 01:19:20.829
SAM: It's Baron's Meats.

01:19:20.829 --> 01:19:21.925
LAURA: Yeah.

01:19:21.925 --> 01:19:24.762
TALIESIN: A fine establishment you've got here.

01:19:24.762 --> 01:19:29.289
MATT: Because of the natural 20 you rolled, you
also notice that while the meats up front look

01:19:29.289 --> 01:19:32.262
very fresh, there's a smell that catches
your nose of rotting meat.

01:19:32.262 --> 01:19:33.899
TALIESIN: I know the smell of rotting meat.

01:19:33.899 --> 01:19:38.819
MATT: And you look past beyond it, and you can
see there's a pile of spoiling meat just thrown

01:19:38.819 --> 01:19:40.263
in the far corner.

01:19:40.263 --> 01:19:41.653
SAM: Ugh.

01:19:41.653 --> 01:19:43.902
TALIESIN: What's that pile for, back there?

01:19:43.902 --> 01:19:47.521
MATT: "I don't know. There's been--
there's been issues."

01:19:47.521 --> 01:19:51.402
TALIESIN: Oh, what kind of issues, if you don't
mind me asking?

01:19:51.402 --> 01:19:57.268
MATT: "Well, in recent weeks all the meat's been
spoiling real fast, like."

01:19:57.268 --> 01:19:59.518
TALIESIN: That doesn't seem right.

01:19:59.518 --> 01:20:00.942
MATT: "Yeah."

01:20:00.942 --> 01:20:03.000
TALIESIN: Well, that's odd.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:08.849
MATT: "Having to raise prices. If you know anyone
who is a hunter, we're paying for meat,

01:20:08.849 --> 01:20:10.860
"one gold piece by the pound."

01:20:10.860 --> 01:20:15.070
TALIESIN: If you don't mind me asking, you don't
happen to know where that spoiled meat came from

01:20:15.070 --> 01:20:21.236
do you? I mean, maybe there's a problem with the
water source or something. I've got some talents

01:20:21.236 --> 01:20:23.496
of my own. Maybe I can help out a bit?

01:20:24.155 --> 01:20:31.740
MATT: "If you want to buy it, it's half price.
They're all from different sources."

01:20:31.740 --> 01:20:32.631
TALIESIN: Really?

01:20:32.631 --> 01:20:33.433
MATT: "Yeah."

01:20:33.433 --> 01:20:35.093
TALIESIN: Are they all the same kind of animal?
Or--

01:20:35.093 --> 01:20:40.583
MATT: "No. Different kinds of animal. Usually they
last us a good two weeks, the way we prep them and

01:20:40.583 --> 01:20:46.505
"salt them up. Preservatives and all that. Oh,
sorry." And he puts the monocle back in.

01:20:46.505 --> 01:20:48.881
(laughter)

01:20:48.881 --> 01:20:53.590
MATT: "But this is-- this is weird. Don't like it,
not at all."

01:20:53.590 --> 01:20:57.809
TALIESIN: Well, if I hear anything,
I'll let you know.

01:20:57.809 --> 01:20:59.998
MATT: "Please do. You buying something?"

01:20:59.998 --> 01:21:03.923
TALIESIN: Sadly, not for myself, but I will be
back to buy something for a fr--

01:21:03.923 --> 01:21:07.683
MATT: "Oh come on, put some meat on your bones.
You're looking right skinny." He reaches over and

01:21:07.683 --> 01:21:13.092
grabs your arm and tugs it a bit. "Heh, heh.
You're a tiny one."

01:21:13.092 --> 01:21:20.100
TALIESIN: I'm sadly of a monastic tradition that does
not allow me to consume the flesh of animals, so...

01:21:20.100 --> 01:21:22.316
MATT: "What?"

01:21:22.316 --> 01:21:26.464
(laughter)

01:21:26.464 --> 01:21:27.530
TALIESIN: I eat plants.

01:21:27.530 --> 01:21:31.538
MATT: Pfft. (laughs)

01:21:31.538 --> 01:21:33.314
TALIESIN: You're not the first.

01:21:33.314 --> 01:21:40.830
MATT: "You're funny. Here." He cuts off a little bit
and he tosses it to you. "Right size for your troubles."

01:21:40.830 --> 01:21:42.484
TALIESIN: Thank you, kind sir.

01:21:42.484 --> 01:21:43.214
MATT: "Eat it quick!"

01:21:43.214 --> 01:21:47.349
TALIESIN: See you soon. I've turned around and I'm
going to give it to Nott.

01:21:47.349 --> 01:21:49.973
(laughter)

01:21:49.973 --> 01:21:51.166
TALIESIN: How is it?

01:21:51.166 --> 01:21:52.517
SAM: It's meat!

01:21:52.517 --> 01:21:54.083
TALIESIN: That's what he said.

01:21:54.083 --> 01:21:59.242
MARISHA: That was a good idea, though, trying to
track the meat.

01:21:59.242 --> 01:22:02.809
TALIESIN: I was hoping for a bit more, but the
meat's going bad faster than it should, especially

01:22:02.809 --> 01:22:05.624
if they are salting it. It shouldn't
go that quickly.

01:22:05.624 --> 01:22:07.025
TRAVIS: No, it shouldn't.

01:22:07.025 --> 01:22:11.603
MARISHA: Do you think it's worth checking in with
the fish guy, see if fish have the same problem?

01:22:11.603 --> 01:22:12.514
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:22:12.514 --> 01:22:13.468
MARISHA: Is that a thing?

01:22:13.468 --> 01:22:15.261
TRAVIS: Let's go over to that black dragonborn
over there.

01:22:15.261 --> 01:22:16.038
MARISHA: Okay.

01:22:16.038 --> 01:22:17.204
TRAVIS: Mosey up to his table.

01:22:17.204 --> 01:22:18.385
MATT: All right.

01:22:18.385 --> 01:22:20.285
TALIESIN: So many puns I'm not making. Carry on.

01:22:20.285 --> 01:22:21.219
TRAVIS: How do?

01:22:21.219 --> 01:22:24.799
MATT: You walk up to the dragonborn, massive
shoulders. But you know, skipped leg day every

01:22:24.799 --> 01:22:32.884
time. He is sitting there throwing another fish
over the line, and you can see there are fishing

01:22:32.884 --> 01:22:40.166
supplies off to the side. Sweating through the
scales, the eyes themselves a very piercing sky

01:22:40.166 --> 01:22:46.684
blue, white iris. Glances over. "Aye, can I help
you? You getting fish?"

01:22:46.684 --> 01:22:50.143
TRAVIS: Yeah. Just curious what you had, and what
the catch of the day was.

01:22:50.143 --> 01:22:56.743
MATT: "We got blue fish, we got red fish, we got
gray fish. Gray fish are the bigger fish."

01:22:56.743 --> 01:22:58.683
TRAVIS: Are the fish red, blue, and gray?

01:22:58.683 --> 01:23:04.218
MATT: Yeah. There are elements of the hue in
there, where you can see that being the

01:23:04.218 --> 01:23:11.280
distinction he uses. You gather that this person
isn't a fishmonger or master of the fish

01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:17.902
themselves, and has just probably started a couple
of months ago catching fish and trying to sell

01:23:17.902 --> 01:23:19.668
them and isn't doing a very good job.

01:23:19.668 --> 01:23:24.783
MARISHA: While Fjord is keeping him entertained,
can I do a scan to see if there is a similar pile

01:23:24.783 --> 01:23:27.207
of rotted fish back there that he is
having to discard?

01:23:27.207 --> 01:23:28.498
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:23:28.498 --> 01:23:32.116
TALIESIN: Maybe pick me up like, one f--two fish,
a red-- the blue fish.

01:23:32.116 --> 01:23:33.394
(groans)

01:23:33.394 --> 01:23:34.281
MARISHA: 12.

01:23:34.281 --> 01:23:40.447
TALIESIN: Got it out of my system.
That was painful.

01:23:40.447 --> 01:23:43.052
MATT: Not in the vicinity, no.

01:23:45.252 --> 01:23:50.098
TRAVIS: The tree that is behind him, does it look
unusual? Medium-sized tree? Small tree?

01:23:50.098 --> 01:23:55.319
MATT: It looks unusual in the sense that, in about
a mile surrounding the city, there are no trees.

01:23:55.319 --> 01:24:01.014
You do see them occasionally, clusters of them
across the fields, but they're pretty sparse. And

01:24:01.014 --> 01:24:09.875
the ones that you see are, at least for this time
of year, leafless. Or are very hardy, swamp-type

01:24:09.875 --> 01:24:13.546
trees that endure very rough terrain.

01:24:13.546 --> 01:24:17.633
LIAM: Is the same true of grass? Is it more
of a dead landscape around here,

01:24:17.633 --> 01:24:19.115
or have we seen grasses here?

01:24:19.115 --> 01:24:26.087
MATT: You've seen grasses, but they are usually
very thick, hardy, brown-gray grasses, scrub. A

01:24:26.087 --> 01:24:31.075
lot of scrubland-type plants here. Elements of
what you would imagine in a--

01:24:31.075 --> 01:24:32.396
LIAM: Scottish moors.

01:24:32.396 --> 01:24:35.528
MATT: I would say Scottish moors meets
Joshua Tree.

01:24:35.528 --> 01:24:40.639
TRAVIS: Okay. Does the tree look
uncharacteristically healthy for the climate?

01:24:40.639 --> 01:24:46.078
MATT: No; it looks healthier than the others, but
it's also in the middle of a place where people

01:24:46.078 --> 01:24:49.134
probably take care of it more than just having to
live on its own in the middle of space.

01:24:49.134 --> 01:24:50.434
It doesn't catch you as strange.

01:24:50.434 --> 01:24:52.399
TALIESIN: The tree's not giving off any
bad vibes?

01:24:52.399 --> 01:24:53.862
MATT: Make a nature check.

01:24:53.862 --> 01:24:56.856
LAURA: The tree is the new chair.

01:24:56.856 --> 01:24:57.724
TALIESIN: No.

01:24:57.724 --> 01:24:59.917
TRAVIS: What about the tree?

01:24:59.917 --> 01:25:01.770
TALIESIN: That was a one minus one.

01:25:01.770 --> 01:25:07.256
MATT: You're like, "That tree--" (sniff), and you
smell the meat on your fingers and it completely

01:25:07.256 --> 01:25:09.031
distracts you, and you lose sight of it.

01:25:09.031 --> 01:25:14.755
TALIESIN: Salt. Fish.

01:25:14.755 --> 01:25:16.169
TRAVIS: I'm so fucking hungry.

01:25:16.169 --> 01:25:21.939
LIAM: I want to go to this Timoch and Ude place,
but-- Excuse me, do you know, where do these fish

01:25:21.939 --> 01:25:23.788
come in from? Are they river?

01:25:23.788 --> 01:25:32.169
MATT: "Yeah, got them out of the Ifolon, that way,
to the west. Ifolon. Ifolon River?"

01:25:32.169 --> 01:25:33.529
LIAM: Thank you.

01:25:33.529 --> 01:25:34.985
MATT: "Yeah, yeah."

01:25:34.985 --> 01:25:38.985
MARISHA: Have any problem with rotting fish? I
give him a little crazy eye, to go with my look.

01:25:38.985 --> 01:25:44.918
MATT: He looks down at you. He's a good foot
taller than you. His snout puckers up a bit.

01:25:44.918 --> 01:25:48.318
MARISHA: Just going bad a little too quick?

01:25:48.318 --> 01:25:52.486
MATT: "Maybe, I don't know. I sell a lot of them,
really quick; I wouldn't know."

01:25:53.016 --> 01:25:54.247
MARISHA: Yeah, no, no.

01:25:54.247 --> 01:25:56.116
TRAVIS: Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:25:56.116 --> 01:25:57.266
MARISHA: Yeah, let's go.

01:25:57.266 --> 01:25:58.839
TRAVIS: Good luck with your haul.

01:25:58.839 --> 01:26:00.456
MATT: "You going to buy anything?"

01:26:00.456 --> 01:26:01.174
TRAVIS: Nope.

01:26:01.174 --> 01:26:06.379
MATT: "Well, fuck you too!" You get the sense--
this guy: not a good salesman.

01:26:06.573 --> 01:26:08.094
Probably not doing too well.

01:26:08.094 --> 01:26:12.152
TALIESIN: That guy worked at Brookstone.
That'll make you hard.

01:26:12.152 --> 01:26:13.701
LAURA: Madam Musk.

01:26:13.701 --> 01:26:15.701
SAM: Madam Musk's? Okay, what does she do?

01:26:15.851 --> 01:26:17.270
TRAVIS: She makes musks.

01:26:17.270 --> 01:26:18.130
SAM: Okay.

01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:19.915
MATT: You head to the hut?

01:26:19.915 --> 01:26:21.288
LIAM: We're trying it all.

01:26:21.288 --> 01:26:22.351
MATT: All right then.

01:26:24.441 --> 01:26:26.399
TRAVIS: You build it, we're going.

01:26:26.399 --> 01:26:30.333
SAM: We're not going to buy anything. We're just
going to go, insult you, and leave.

01:26:30.687 --> 01:26:40.284
MATT: That's why I show up every Thursday. As you
approach the outside of the hut, you can see that

01:26:40.284 --> 01:26:47.085
interesting ivy that's climbing over it, creating
this unique net-like lattice of very

01:26:47.085 --> 01:26:51.672
jagged-looking ivy. It's almost like miniature
brambles that twist and knot over each other. It's

01:26:51.672 --> 01:26:57.263
weirdly beautiful, but also a very no-touch
scenario. As you approach the front of it, you can

01:26:57.263 --> 01:27:05.914
see there's a cord hanging across the entryway,
and a curtain that is split in the center of what

01:27:05.914 --> 01:27:09.848
would have been a bright purple at one time, but
the color is faded over how long it's been here.

01:27:09.848 --> 01:27:15.213
Now it's this purplish-gray, tattered at the
bottom, soaked in this dark brown mud that's set

01:27:15.213 --> 01:27:25.839
within the base of it. The smell hits you and it's
very strong. Medicinal herbs, ground roots and

01:27:25.839 --> 01:27:32.269
powders, and as soon as you step to the cloth, the
interior is-- and this is actually for you, a

01:27:32.269 --> 01:27:40.660
welcome sight. There's a lot of things here that
can be treated like teas. There are all sorts of

01:27:40.660 --> 01:27:49.821
bulbs and roots and dried vegetable matter that
seems to have been pulled out in strings and then

01:27:49.821 --> 01:27:57.631
woven together into long braids that are dangling.
You can see cages that hang in areas with

01:27:57.631 --> 01:28:04.916
moss-covered, shelled creatures that are slowly
shifting in their spaces. In the center, there is

01:28:04.916 --> 01:28:12.975
a wicker chair. In that wicker chair you see a
cloaked figure with a big hood that completely

01:28:12.975 --> 01:28:21.415
obscures the face. You see two tiny clawed hands
that are a red-brown scale across the top of them,

01:28:21.415 --> 01:28:27.878
that sits in there with two tiny legs. It's weird.
There's a giant head and torso, and these tiny

01:28:27.878 --> 01:28:32.852
little hands and tiny little legs. It's very
creepy. It's almost like an old woman with baby

01:28:32.852 --> 01:28:35.672
proportions. It's upsetting when you approach.

01:28:35.672 --> 01:28:37.554
LAURA: Do you see her face?

01:28:37.554 --> 01:28:39.695
MATT: No, the hood is covering the face.

01:28:39.695 --> 01:28:43.245
LAURA: Hello, hello, hello!

01:28:43.245 --> 01:28:44.968
LIAM: Hello, grandmother.

01:28:44.968 --> 01:28:50.821
MATT:"You've come to talk to Madam Musk?"

01:28:50.821 --> 01:28:52.790
MARISHA: Oh, fuck this, let's go.

01:28:52.790 --> 01:28:54.840
TALIESIN: I'm so in. Yes, we have.

01:28:54.840 --> 01:28:56.573
LAURA: Yes, we have. We definitely have.

01:28:56.573 --> 01:29:03.239
MATT: "What you looking for?" (creaking) She
begins rocking in this wicker chair.

01:29:03.239 --> 01:29:10.189
TRAVIS: I'm fucking out. I turn around. Somebody
else take over!

01:29:10.189 --> 01:29:14.616
LIAM: Grandmother, do you know much of this city?

01:29:14.616 --> 01:29:22.800
MATT: "I don't wander it often, but I do
know the land."

01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:24.186
TRAVIS: I don't like it!

01:29:24.186 --> 01:29:25.427
LIAM: Hmm.

01:29:25.427 --> 01:29:26.765
SAM: Ooh, boy.

01:29:26.765 --> 01:29:28.037
LAURA: You tell fortunes?

01:29:28.037 --> 01:29:34.577
MATT: "No. But I make potions."

01:29:34.577 --> 01:29:36.858
SAM: What kind of potions do you make?

01:29:36.858 --> 01:29:42.066
MATT: "Salves. Balms. Whatever ails you."

01:29:42.066 --> 01:29:51.101
SAM: Nothing ails us currently, but
that changes frequently.

01:29:51.101 --> 01:29:56.387
LAURA: I love her so much!

01:29:56.387 --> 01:30:00.659
LIAM: We are very interested in this, of course.
What are your wares?

01:30:00.659 --> 01:30:05.014
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm standing in the corner with my
head in my arm going: Ask her about healing potions!

01:30:05.014 --> 01:30:07.282
LIAM: You're in the corner in Blair Witch.

01:30:07.282 --> 01:30:08.455
TRAVIS: I want more!

01:30:08.455 --> 01:30:10.899
TALIESIN: Raise your hand if you want
off the ride.

01:30:10.899 --> 01:30:17.715
SAM: We have the ability to heal wounds, but is there
any other condition that your potions can restore?

01:30:17.715 --> 01:30:21.908
MATT: "I've prepared a few antivenoms."

01:30:21.908 --> 01:30:24.341
LAURA: That might be useful.

01:30:24.341 --> 01:30:27.155
SAM: Is that important around these parts?

01:30:27.155 --> 01:30:31.302
MATT: "Might be. I don't know, I don't
travel too far."

01:30:31.302 --> 01:30:36.304
LAURA: How long have you been here, Madam Musk?

01:30:36.304 --> 01:30:37.666
MARISHA: This is terrible.

01:30:37.666 --> 01:30:39.636
MATT: "What was your question?"

01:30:39.636 --> 01:30:41.589
LAURA: How long have you been here?

01:30:41.589 --> 01:30:46.049
MATT: "As long as the elements around me."

01:30:46.049 --> 01:30:57.955
MARISHA: (whispered) What? You said you've
recently made antivenom potions?

01:30:57.955 --> 01:31:03.254
MATT: One of the hands comes up and points over,
and there's a small shelf to the side. The door's

01:31:03.254 --> 01:31:08.955
locked. "In there, I keep them."

01:31:08.955 --> 01:31:10.947
TRAVIS: Kill this woman.

01:31:10.947 --> 01:31:16.801
MARISHA: Okay. Did you recently make them
due to a--

01:31:16.801 --> 01:31:18.442
SAM: Influx of poisonings?

01:31:18.442 --> 01:31:22.920
MARISHA: Yes! An influx of venomous things coming
to you that you could do that? Is that why

01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:27.182
they're-- I'm so nervous. She's freaking me out,
Fjord. She's freaking me out.

01:31:27.182 --> 01:31:28.565
TRAVIS: Yeah. You're point blank.

01:31:28.565 --> 01:31:31.044
MARISHA: I take a few steps back and I
just, you know--

01:31:31.044 --> 01:31:32.967
TRAVIS: Gesture wildly? To accomodate?

01:31:32.967 --> 01:31:38.734
MATT: "I just like to be prepared, that's all."

01:31:38.734 --> 01:31:42.749
LAURA: I'm ducking down. I really want to try to
get a look at her.

01:31:42.749 --> 01:31:44.207
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:31:44.207 --> 01:31:46.252
TRAVIS: What do you accept as payment?

01:31:46.252 --> 01:31:48.410
MATT: "Gold or trade."

01:31:48.410 --> 01:31:50.553
TRAVIS: Not souls, or faces?

01:31:50.553 --> 01:31:52.739
MATT: "Are you offering?"

01:31:52.739 --> 01:31:56.656
MARISHA: Don't. First off, she's lying.

01:31:56.656 --> 01:31:57.886
TRAVIS: Is she?

01:31:57.886 --> 01:31:59.407
TALIESIN: Sadly, he has neither.

01:31:59.407 --> 01:32:00.391
LAURA: 22!

01:32:00.441 --> 01:32:01.510
MATT: 22?

01:32:02.060 --> 01:32:05.685
LAURA: Yes! It's going to be an actual baby.

01:32:05.685 --> 01:32:06.704
TALIESIN: Oh, man.

01:32:06.704 --> 01:32:11.040
SAM: Stay tuned for Monday's Kickstarter launch!
The Legend of Vox Machina animated special.

01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:12.859
TALIESIN: This is everything I've
wanted.

01:32:12.859 --> 01:32:14.449
TRAVIS: It's going to be amazing.

01:32:14.449 --> 01:32:18.591
TALIESIN: I'm just going to point out it's another
chair. I feel they're connected.

01:32:19.281 --> 01:32:22.215
SAM: You mean, this woman's chair? The wicker
chair?

01:32:22.215 --> 01:32:26.129
TALIESIN: We've had wooden chair, this is now the
order of the wicked wicker chair.

01:32:26.129 --> 01:32:28.566
SAM: What's one step crazier than that?

01:32:28.566 --> 01:32:30.943
TALIESIN: That will be the society of the stool.

01:32:31.333 --> 01:32:35.021
LIAM: The Legend of Vox Machina: not a single
character with tiny hands.

01:32:35.496 --> 01:32:37.738
TRAVIS: What, what?

01:32:37.738 --> 01:32:44.734
MATT: We cannot guarantee that, Liam.
"Are you looking to buy?"

01:32:44.734 --> 01:32:49.345
SAM: Is it just the antivenom, or do you have any
other wares for sale?

01:32:49.767 --> 01:32:57.817
MATT: "I do have another healing potion, but I
can't make more, because I'm out of tumor moss."

01:32:57.817 --> 01:33:00.439
SAM, MARISHA and LIAM: Tumor moss?

01:33:00.439 --> 01:33:01.958
MATT: "Tumor moss."

01:33:01.958 --> 01:33:03.958
LIAM: It needs two mimosas?

01:33:03.958 --> 01:33:07.138
(laughter)

01:33:07.138 --> 01:33:08.684
SAM: A little orange juice, a little champagne.

01:33:08.684 --> 01:33:10.990
LIAM: That's the biggest throwback yet.

01:33:10.990 --> 01:33:16.450
SAM and MARISHA: Tumor moss?

01:33:16.450 --> 01:33:18.419
MATT: "Tumor moss, yes."

01:33:18.419 --> 01:33:19.739
LAURA: Tumor moss.

01:33:19.739 --> 01:33:29.559
MATT: "I usually have to send a boy out to get it
for me, but the local patches have dried up, so--"

01:33:29.559 --> 01:33:35.629
SAM: Oh, yes. The farmlands and the livestock have
been affected by something.

01:33:35.629 --> 01:33:43.219
MATT: "I know a place where there is some, if you
want to get it for me, like a nice goblin."

01:33:43.219 --> 01:33:46.994
LIAM: This is the weirdest production of The
Secret Garden ever.

01:33:46.994 --> 01:33:50.082
LAURA: I definitely think we should get
some for you.

01:33:50.082 --> 01:33:55.500
SAM: Where do you know that there is tumor moss
that still grows?

01:33:55.500 --> 01:34:03.911
MATT: The hand picks up and points over behind the
right shoulder and says, "There's a small cove

01:34:03.911 --> 01:34:14.672
along the eastern bank of the Ifolon River.
Surrounded by seven trees, this grove is. The

01:34:14.672 --> 01:34:27.085
small bank, there. There you'll find the strongest
batch of tumor moss this side of Xhorhas."

01:34:27.085 --> 01:34:29.135
TRAVIS: I want sheet music to that.

01:34:29.135 --> 01:34:34.183
SAM: (singing) Ah, ah, ah, ah, stayin' alive,
stayin' alive.

01:34:34.183 --> 01:34:36.614
(laughter)

01:34:36.614 --> 01:34:42.436
LIAM: (Madame Musk voice) If I had a fine white
horse, (singing) I'd take you for a ride today.

01:34:42.436 --> 01:34:46.340
(laughter)

01:34:46.340 --> 01:34:51.890
LAURA: Oh my god. How much for the antivenom stuff
that you have made?

01:34:51.890 --> 01:34:56.519
MATT: "I have four prepared. 50 gold apiece."

01:34:56.519 --> 01:34:57.615
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:34:57.615 --> 01:34:58.489
SAM: All?

01:34:58.489 --> 01:34:59.869
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll buy all four of them.

01:34:59.869 --> 01:35:02.168
LAURA: How do you have that much money after we
just spent money on the--

01:35:02.168 --> 01:35:05.007
TRAVIS: I'll take it. I just throw 200 gold
at her.

01:35:05.007 --> 01:35:07.437
(laughter)

01:35:07.437 --> 01:35:10.992
MATT: (clanging) "Oh no, you've made a mess."

01:35:10.992 --> 01:35:13.631
LAURA: I'll go, and I'll help pick it up, yeah.

01:35:13.631 --> 01:35:15.271
SAM: I'll pick it up and put it in her
tiny doll hands.

01:35:15.271 --> 01:35:16.411
MATT: "I've got it!"

01:35:16.411 --> 01:35:17.386
SAM: Oh!

01:35:17.386 --> 01:35:18.791
MATT: "But thank you."

01:35:18.791 --> 01:35:22.819
LIAM: Grandmother, we have heard rumors about--

01:35:22.819 --> 01:35:25.104
MATT: The hood shifts in your direction.

01:35:25.104 --> 01:35:34.382
LIAM: My parents told me stories about things like
this. Grandmother, we have heard rumors in this

01:35:34.382 --> 01:35:39.880
city of a strange presence. I understand you're in
this home much of the time, but have you heard any

01:35:39.880 --> 01:35:49.974
rumors about anything otherworldly in a way you
are not familiar with here?

01:35:51.211 --> 01:35:53.441
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

01:35:58.695 --> 01:36:01.635
SAM: You have the dodecahedron if you need it.

01:36:01.635 --> 01:36:06.705
LIAM: Didn't help. 14.

01:36:06.705 --> 01:36:23.283
MATT: "I've heard rumors of folks dealing with bad
dreams. Around the square here, sleepless nights.

01:36:23.283 --> 01:36:31.471
Old Potis apparently went crazy and
murdered his family."

01:36:31.471 --> 01:36:33.318
SAM: Old Potis?

01:36:33.318 --> 01:36:34.238
LIAM and MARISHA: Portis?

01:36:38.768 --> 01:36:42.933
TALIESIN: Where did Old Potis used to live?

01:36:43.469 --> 01:36:48.630
MATT: "Used to live four down that side of the
square," and points out directly behind you on

01:36:48.630 --> 01:36:56.040
what would be the western road that leads away
from the square. "But he's not there anymore.

01:36:57.430 --> 01:37:00.378
He was executed but two days ago."

01:37:03.522 --> 01:37:05.744
SAM: Did they board up his house, or anything?

01:37:06.592 --> 01:37:09.454
MATT: "I don't know. I don't leave this hut."

01:37:12.754 --> 01:37:14.638
LIAM: How did they kill him?

01:37:17.788 --> 01:37:20.793
MATT: "I don't leave this hut."

01:37:22.487 --> 01:37:24.713
LAURA: We should go check out his house.

01:37:24.713 --> 01:37:27.909
MARISHA: How do you sustain yourself?

01:37:27.909 --> 01:37:31.227
MATT: "I have my ways."

01:37:31.227 --> 01:37:40.191
TRAVIS: (muffled hysterics)

01:37:40.191 --> 01:37:43.807
LIAM: Fjord, you seem uncomfortable. Would you
like to wait outside?

01:37:43.807 --> 01:37:49.046
TRAVIS: (yelling) I'd just like to ask what the
name-- if I were to look up under equipment, are

01:37:49.046 --> 01:37:52.758
these four vials of poison resistance called?

01:37:52.758 --> 01:37:55.259
MATT: I'll show you at the break.

01:37:55.259 --> 01:37:56.148
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:37:56.148 --> 01:38:03.447
MATT: "If you bring me tumor moss, I can make you
more healing potions."

01:38:03.447 --> 01:38:05.860
LAURA: At a massive discount, please?

01:38:05.860 --> 01:38:10.157
MATT: The head slowly nods in your direction,
twitches a bit.

01:38:10.157 --> 01:38:19.266
TALIESIN: Just for fun, I'm going to detect
undead, just to see what's up.

01:38:19.266 --> 01:38:20.457
MATT: Okay.

01:38:20.457 --> 01:38:22.336
MARISHA: Can I do an insight check?

01:38:22.336 --> 01:38:23.707
TRAVIS: (whispering) Kill this bitch.

01:38:23.707 --> 01:38:31.220
MARISHA: I want to do an insight check when she said
she'll trade in fate or whatever. If she was joking.

01:38:31.220 --> 01:38:32.331
MATT: Trade in--?

01:38:32.331 --> 01:38:39.778
MARISHA: He was like, "Would you trade in fate or
give our fortunes?" She was like, "Are you offering?"

01:38:39.778 --> 01:38:44.592
MATT: Make an insight check. What were
you checking?

01:38:44.731 --> 01:38:46.021
TALIESIN: I have 60 feet.

01:38:46.021 --> 01:38:53.129
MATT: Right. You concentrate and focus to sense
that negative void aura that seems to emanate from

01:38:53.129 --> 01:38:56.449
creatures that are held together through
necromancy. Nothing.

01:38:56.449 --> 01:38:59.297
MARISHA: 19 total.

01:38:59.297 --> 01:39:07.259
SAM: So many whispers tonight. So many whispers.
Each whisper is an opportunity. A whispertunity--

01:39:07.259 --> 01:39:08.758
TRAVIS: A whispertunity?

01:39:08.758 --> 01:39:12.414
SAM: To tell you about the awesome merch that's in
the Critical Role shop.

01:39:12.414 --> 01:39:17.760
LAURA: Oh! Hey, we've got some shirts, like the
one that Travis Willingham's wearing.

01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:20.921
SAM: That's such a good shirt. That's
a ladies' small.

01:39:20.921 --> 01:39:25.433
LAURA: Hey, guess what? I don't know if it's true.
I think it's true? There's a Traveler bumper

01:39:25.433 --> 01:39:28.629
sticker. It might be in there, but I'm not sure.

01:39:28.629 --> 01:39:31.266
SAM: Hey, that is maybe a good plug.

01:39:31.266 --> 01:39:34.262
MARISHA: Did you find anything? Yeah? No? Did you
get a vibe?

01:39:34.262 --> 01:39:36.828
TALIESIN: No, no vibe. Everything is copacetic.

01:39:36.828 --> 01:39:39.675
LAURA: Let's go check out that house.

01:39:39.675 --> 01:39:42.060
TALIESIN: I think that's a good lead.

01:39:42.060 --> 01:39:43.930
LAURA: It's a pretty good lead.

01:39:43.930 --> 01:39:46.701
MATT: "Be safe out there."

01:39:46.701 --> 01:39:50.302
TRAVIS: Fucking-- let's just kill her. Nobody's
going to come in here.

01:39:50.302 --> 01:39:53.529
LAURA: We will be safe. Thank you so much.

01:39:53.529 --> 01:39:54.900
MATT: "Thank you."

01:39:54.900 --> 01:39:56.339
TRAVIS: Can we see her face?

01:39:56.339 --> 01:39:58.180
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:39:58.180 --> 01:40:03.365
LAURA: As we're leaving, I'm going to kneel down
and say: You are doing such a good job, like so,

01:40:03.365 --> 01:40:05.633
so creepy. I'm so impressed with you guys!

01:40:05.633 --> 01:40:09.631
TRAVIS: Natural 18 for a 19.

01:40:09.631 --> 01:40:20.650
MATT: Okay. You notice-- I'll put this out. You
don't get too much detail, but there's something

01:40:20.650 --> 01:40:30.050
odd about the physicality of this woman. The body
seems to move in sections, like it's a person

01:40:30.050 --> 01:40:38.432
poorly made and about to fall apart. It's
off-putting and strange. You get a glance

01:40:38.432 --> 01:40:43.931
underneath, when Jester's talking to her. The head
shoots up towards her and a second and you see a

01:40:43.931 --> 01:40:51.088
snout of some kind, but it's a small, long snout.
For the size of the hood, you see this tiny little

01:40:51.088 --> 01:40:55.746
snout poke through and then pull back in, and the
whole body seems to recoil into the chair a bit

01:40:55.746 --> 01:40:57.062
and get still.

01:40:57.062 --> 01:40:58.450
SAM: What?!

01:40:58.450 --> 01:41:01.031
LAURA: Don't worry, I won't tell anyone!

01:41:01.031 --> 01:41:02.300
MATT: "Shh, Shh!"

01:41:02.300 --> 01:41:06.479
TRAVIS: All right. Go now. Please.

01:41:06.479 --> 01:41:08.493
LAURA: We should go.

01:41:08.493 --> 01:41:11.713
MATT: You guys exit Madam Musk's tent.

01:41:11.713 --> 01:41:13.402
SAM: This is so weird.

01:41:13.402 --> 01:41:16.243
TRAVIS: As soon as we exit, I turn around. Is it
still there?

01:41:16.243 --> 01:41:20.064
MATT: As you turn around... it's still there.

01:41:20.064 --> 01:41:26.101
TRAVIS: Can we please eat or go check out the
boarded-up house? One or the other, just whatever

01:41:26.101 --> 01:41:28.687
direction is further away from
this fucking place?

01:41:28.687 --> 01:41:30.890
SAM: So many mysteries!

01:41:30.890 --> 01:41:33.194
MARISHA: I know, we're starving.

01:41:33.194 --> 01:41:35.185
TRAVIS: All right, the house, the house.

01:41:35.185 --> 01:41:38.952
MARISHA: So it felt like that was several people,
right?

01:41:38.952 --> 01:41:43.042
LAURA: I don't know what you're talking about.
Madam Musk was super creepy and stuff.

01:41:43.042 --> 01:41:46.831
LIAM: You said, "You guys are doing a great job."

01:41:46.831 --> 01:41:50.065
LAURA: No I didn't. I'm sure of it.

01:41:50.065 --> 01:41:52.695
TRAVIS: You guys?

01:41:52.695 --> 01:41:56.720
LAURA: They were really cute, though.

01:41:56.720 --> 01:41:58.021
TRAVIS: Who?

01:41:58.021 --> 01:42:01.241
LAURA: The kobolds!

01:42:01.241 --> 01:42:02.884
SAM: There were kobolds?

01:42:02.884 --> 01:42:03.791
LAURA: Yeah!

01:42:03.791 --> 01:42:05.602
SAM: Wait, there were kobolds under there?

01:42:05.602 --> 01:42:08.632
LAURA: Shh! She wants to be creepy, okay?
Let her be creepy.

01:42:08.632 --> 01:42:10.401
TALIESIN: I don't know what's happening.

01:42:10.401 --> 01:42:12.495
TRAVIS: You're saying that was just
a bunch of kobolds?

01:42:12.495 --> 01:42:13.683
LAURA: Shh!

01:42:13.683 --> 01:42:15.202
SAM: And it was an act?

01:42:15.202 --> 01:42:16.745
LAURA: <i>Shh!</i>

01:42:16.745 --> 01:42:21.831
MARISHA: Those type of creepy people, they're
always acts. They're scammers. That's how

01:42:21.831 --> 01:42:23.310
they make their living.

01:42:23.310 --> 01:42:24.815
SAM: That was amazing!

01:42:24.815 --> 01:42:30.321
LIAM: She was very eloquent, compared to our past
experience with-- okay.

01:42:30.321 --> 01:42:33.616
TRAVIS: Didn't fool me. I was totally comfortable
in there.

01:42:33.616 --> 01:42:35.428
LAURA: You were scared out of your bejeebees.

01:42:35.428 --> 01:42:40.222
SAM: Yeah, by just a couple of kobolds in a little
cloak. Look at you. Big man--

01:42:40.222 --> 01:42:43.794
LAURA: Shh! She's making a whole business off
of it. Don't say anything.

01:42:43.924 --> 01:42:46.515
SAM: Can't even take three kobolds in a
trenchcoat.

01:42:46.515 --> 01:42:49.628
TRAVIS: Keep pushing me, Nott. Keep pushing me.
See what happens.

01:42:49.628 --> 01:42:55.906
SAM: I know how to get you! Go put a blanket over
my head and get some sticks. Ooh!

01:42:55.906 --> 01:43:02.252
(laughter)

01:43:03.208 --> 01:43:05.639
LIAM: So we are going to check out this
murderer's--

01:43:05.639 --> 01:43:07.397
TRAVIS: Four houses down on the left.

01:43:07.397 --> 01:43:09.105
SAM: Old crazy Potis. Portis?

01:43:09.105 --> 01:43:14.043
MARISHA: Yeah, we look for the house on the left.
The house at the end of the road.

01:43:14.043 --> 01:43:15.249
LIAM: The murder house.

01:43:15.249 --> 01:43:22.795
MATT: You head west back through the square,
passing the Four Corners on the right, and Baron

01:43:22.795 --> 01:43:29.775
Visco's butchery to the left. Going four houses
down to the left, you see a small home, maybe

01:43:29.775 --> 01:43:38.274
three rooms total. The wood's warped, and the
building itself leans a little bit to the right,

01:43:38.274 --> 01:43:39.866
but it's closed up.

01:43:41.442 --> 01:43:47.979
MARISHA: Does it look like there's locks or
barricades, or police-line, do-not-cross tape?

01:43:47.979 --> 01:43:51.098
MATT: There is not a police line, but it does
appear to be locked.

01:43:51.098 --> 01:43:54.620
TALIESIN: Does it look lived-in still, or does it
look closed?

01:43:54.620 --> 01:43:56.295
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:43:56.295 --> 01:43:58.128
TALIESIN: Good, my best thing to roll.

01:43:58.128 --> 01:44:00.520
LIAM: Chimneys, holes, gaps, big enough for a
cat?

01:44:00.520 --> 01:44:02.113
TALIESIN: That's a four.

01:44:02.113 --> 01:44:04.108
MATT: You look at the house, and--

01:44:04.108 --> 01:44:06.075
TALIESIN: Four walls. Roof.

01:44:06.075 --> 01:44:08.451
SAM: I'm just going to pick the lock. I'm going to
pick the lock.

01:44:08.451 --> 01:44:13.552
MATT: Make a d20 check, with your proficiency
modifier and dexterity.

01:44:13.552 --> 01:44:16.730
LAURA: Is anybody watching? I want to look and
make sure nobody's watching when Nott does that.

01:44:16.730 --> 01:44:18.326
SAM: 26.

01:44:18.326 --> 01:44:20.528
TRAVIS: Yasha will provide a meat-shield barrier.

01:44:20.528 --> 01:44:25.742
MATT: Okay. I mean, there's a lot of people
walking through this street, and you're going to

01:44:25.742 --> 01:44:27.399
the front door to pick it.

01:44:27.399 --> 01:44:29.660
MARISHA: Is there a back door? I want to do a
little scout around.

01:44:29.660 --> 01:44:30.932
SAM: Too late!

01:44:30.932 --> 01:44:33.361
MARISHA: While Nott's working on it, I want to
scout the perimeter.

01:44:33.361 --> 01:44:35.713
MATT: There is no back door. It's small enough to
the point where there's really only one entrance

01:44:35.713 --> 01:44:36.841
and exit.

01:44:36.841 --> 01:44:38.231
MARISHA: Windows?

01:44:38.231 --> 01:44:42.608
MATT: There is one window, in the back, but it's
boarded shut.

01:44:42.608 --> 01:44:46.109
MARISHA: I pull on the boards a little bit. Do
they seem like they're in there?

01:44:46.109 --> 01:44:54.062
MATT: They're recently nailed, so they're not
weathered and losing their strength. But they're

01:44:54.062 --> 01:44:57.079
boards. They can be broken or pushed in with
enough force.

01:44:57.079 --> 01:45:00.708
MARISHA: Okay. How you doing, Nott? I come back
around the corner.

01:45:00.708 --> 01:45:02.995
SAM: Almost done! 26.

01:45:02.995 --> 01:45:07.296
MATT: 26? (lock clicks, creaking) Door opens up.

01:45:07.296 --> 01:45:09.821
MARISHA: I do a scan, anyone watching us?

01:45:09.821 --> 01:45:11.491
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:45:11.491 --> 01:45:12.948
LAURA: That's what I was trying to do too.

01:45:12.948 --> 01:45:14.143
MATT: You as well?

01:45:14.143 --> 01:45:17.793
MARISHA: That's a natural one, so I'm distracted.

01:45:17.793 --> 01:45:19.917
LAURA: 24.

01:45:19.917 --> 01:45:23.487
TALIESIN: (counting) 25.

01:45:23.487 --> 01:45:33.164
MATT: There's a couple of folks that are looking
over strangely as Nott picks open the door, and

01:45:33.164 --> 01:45:34.859
they're like--

01:45:34.859 --> 01:45:36.865
SAM: Want to create a diversion or something?

01:45:36.865 --> 01:45:41.352
LAURA: It's our house that we left stuff in, so.

01:45:41.352 --> 01:45:50.312
MATT: There's this rough-and-tumble looking
hobgoblin; red skin, pointed nose, dark hair that

01:45:50.313 --> 01:45:57.394
tumbles past the ears that point backwards and
this big square jaw approaches and goes, "Hey,

01:45:57.394 --> 01:46:00.719
hey. What's your business?"

01:46:00.719 --> 01:46:08.739
SAM: Potis owed us some money. We were going to
collect some of his furniture to repay the debt.

01:46:09.628 --> 01:46:11.728
MATT: Make a deception check.

01:46:11.728 --> 01:46:17.212
SAM: That's a-- deception? Oh, negative three.
15!

01:46:17.212 --> 01:46:24.695
MATT: With a 15, "All right. Makes sense." Turns
around and walks around. It was more like, "What

01:46:24.695 --> 01:46:29.894
are you doing?" Didn't seem to be too inquisitive;
once you said that, it was like, "Oh, I get it,"

01:46:29.894 --> 01:46:31.556
and just walked away.

01:46:31.556 --> 01:46:33.515
TALIESIN: That was very impressive. What is wrong
with people here?

01:46:33.623 --> 01:46:36.304
TRAVIS: Yasha will stay an outside sentry, and
we'll all go into the house real fast; take a look.

01:46:36.304 --> 01:46:37.466
SAM: Okay.

01:46:37.466 --> 01:46:38.169
LAURA: All right.

01:46:38.169 --> 01:46:39.400
TALIESIN: I'll pop in the house.

01:46:39.400 --> 01:46:40.500
MARISHA: I pop in as well.

01:46:40.500 --> 01:46:45.009
MATT: You walk inside. It's very lightly
furnished, and sets a theme for probably how a lot

01:46:45.009 --> 01:46:52.795
of this city is. There is a simple table with a
couple of chairs. You can see another table that's

01:46:52.795 --> 01:47:01.023
used for dining mostly, and smaller chairs. This
looks like maybe a family lived here? What you do

01:47:01.023 --> 01:47:07.567
notice is the floor around the dining table to the
left, and near the entranceway that goes into what

01:47:07.567 --> 01:47:11.334
might have been a bedroom, is just puddles of
dried blood.

01:47:11.334 --> 01:47:13.026
TRAVIS: Ugh.

01:47:13.026 --> 01:47:15.709
SAM: Ooh. Any rifts to the Abyss?

01:47:15.709 --> 01:47:17.451
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:47:17.725 --> 01:47:19.494
TRAVIS: One story, right? Not two stories?

01:47:19.494 --> 01:47:20.944
MATT: One story, yeah.

01:47:20.944 --> 01:47:22.164
SAM: 12.

01:47:22.164 --> 01:47:25.606
MATT: You don't see anything of that kind
whatsoever.

01:47:25.606 --> 01:47:29.361
TALIESIN: I'm going to head towards the bedroom,
where the bloodstain seems to be coming from, take

01:47:29.361 --> 01:47:32.343
a look around. I'm also looking to see if there's
a basement of any kind.

01:47:32.343 --> 01:47:35.096
MATT: You're looking for a basement, you said?

01:47:35.096 --> 01:47:36.216
TALIESIN: That, too.

01:47:36.216 --> 01:47:37.850
MATT: Investigation check.

01:47:37.850 --> 01:47:41.852
LIAM: I'll follow him; as someone who has left
blood before, I want to Will Graham this room and

01:47:41.852 --> 01:47:43.933
see if I can ascertain how this happened.

01:47:43.933 --> 01:47:45.725
MATT: Investigation check as well.

01:47:45.725 --> 01:47:54.290
MARISHA: Can I look for any loose floorboards,
papers, places that people might hide scrawlings,

01:47:54.290 --> 01:47:56.746
hidden compartments?

01:47:56.746 --> 01:47:58.910
MATT: Sure, make an investigation check.

01:47:58.910 --> 01:48:04.135
LAURA: What does it look like where the blood came
from? Where were the bodies?

01:48:04.135 --> 01:48:09.160
MATT: That's what an investigation check would
allow. You rolled a what? A six? You're (hmph)

01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:11.470
it's escaping your peripheral.

01:48:11.470 --> 01:48:12.993
LIAM: 13.

01:48:12.993 --> 01:48:19.259
MATT: 13, not too bad. Looking around the bedroom,
you can see where it looks like there was probably

01:48:19.259 --> 01:48:27.193
one death on the bed itself. It looks like the
splatter-patterns across the ground was there was

01:48:27.193 --> 01:48:33.645
some sort of a struggle. There are two other
smaller puddles, where three bodies eventually

01:48:33.645 --> 01:48:39.190
laid to rest and bled out. So there were three
deaths here: one large, on the bed, and then two

01:48:39.190 --> 01:48:42.161
smaller ones in the dining area.

01:48:42.161 --> 01:48:44.465
TALIESIN: Anything in the closet? I'm going to
check all the rooms.

01:48:44.465 --> 01:48:49.161
MATT: There's no closet. There are drawers and stuff,
but the place has already been stripped clean.

01:48:49.161 --> 01:48:53.298
LAURA: Does it look like they were killed and put
in a place, or does it look like they were killed

01:48:53.298 --> 01:48:54.754
and just fell?

01:48:54.754 --> 01:48:56.901
MATT: It's hard to tell, really.

01:48:56.901 --> 01:49:01.677
LIAM: I'm going to sit on the floor and pull out
my spellbook and slap it down and take the time to

01:49:01.677 --> 01:49:03.680
cast Detect Magic as a ritual.

01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:05.046
MATT: Okay, and what were you doing?

01:49:05.046 --> 01:49:08.655
MARISHA: 23 to look for loose floorboards,
places that--

01:49:08.655 --> 01:49:09.972
TRAVIS: Shelves.

01:49:09.972 --> 01:49:13.594
MARISHA: Hidden shit.

01:49:13.594 --> 01:49:15.663
MATT: You look around--

01:49:15.663 --> 01:49:19.602
MARISHA: Feeling under desks, doing the
Cobalt Soul thing.

01:49:19.602 --> 01:49:26.371
MATT: Most of the ground in here is not wooden
boards more that it's stones that have been placed

01:49:26.371 --> 01:49:32.858
in the mud and then gone over with a bit of
masonry to seal it, so there's no loose boards.

01:49:32.858 --> 01:49:38.430
You do feel around-- it was a very good check, but
you feel certain that there is no hidden

01:49:38.430 --> 01:49:45.873
compartment or a basement or anything beyond this.
It is a simple abode, so at least you confirm for

01:49:45.873 --> 01:49:50.040
yourself that there isn't something you're
missing, as far as the structure itself.

01:49:50.040 --> 01:49:53.090
SAM: All right. Aww, poo.

01:49:53.090 --> 01:49:55.117
TRAVIS: Detecting magic?

01:49:55.117 --> 01:49:57.901
LIAM: It takes a little bit, he's still casting
on the floor.

01:49:57.901 --> 01:50:03.112
MATT: You take a little bit, you cast Detect
Magic. Nothing. The house seems pretty abandoned,

01:50:03.112 --> 01:50:10.489
cleaned out, and whatever remnants of these
murders took place, this individual, this Old

01:50:10.489 --> 01:50:15.402
Potis you heard about, apparently did this, and
was executed a couple of days ago.

01:50:15.402 --> 01:50:17.772
TRAVIS: Can we go eat?

01:50:17.772 --> 01:50:22.859
LIAM: I burn another spell slot to return myself
to looking like Jester as a boy.

01:50:22.859 --> 01:50:24.141
MATT: Okay.

01:50:24.141 --> 01:50:29.361
SAM: All right, let's go eat. Maybe we can ask
around at the pub or whatever, the tavern.

01:50:29.361 --> 01:50:31.291
TRAVIS: Yeah, whatever. Who cares.

01:50:31.291 --> 01:50:34.646
LAURA: Maybe they'll know where Potis worked or
something; maybe he was exposed to something there.

01:50:34.646 --> 01:50:40.075
SAM: It seems like a lot of people have been
exposed to this crazy-making miasma.

01:50:40.075 --> 01:50:43.573
LAURA: Maybe he woke up from a bad dream and
killed everyone.

01:50:43.573 --> 01:50:46.055
TRAVIS: Maybe he ate some bad meat.

01:50:46.055 --> 01:50:51.251
LAURA: Maybe-- Fjord, Oh my gosh, what if in your
bad dream sometime, you're going to wake up and

01:50:51.251 --> 01:50:54.093
murder all of us when we're in our bubble hut?

01:50:54.093 --> 01:50:58.445
TRAVIS: You know when I am going to murder all of you
is in five minutes if we don't fucking eat something.

01:50:58.445 --> 01:51:01.084
LAURA: We're going there right now! We're walking
there, Fjord.

01:51:01.084 --> 01:51:02.442
TRAVIS: Walk faster.

01:51:02.442 --> 01:51:07.470
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, he was publicly executed, so we should
gossip with the locals to find out why.

01:51:08.950 --> 01:51:10.891
SAM: We'll go gossip.

01:51:12.208 --> 01:51:13.922

01:51:14.042 --> 01:51:15.721
LAURA: To the Four Corners!

01:51:15.721 --> 01:51:19.055
MATT: All right, you guys head back out into the
main thoroughfare, over to the Four Corners

01:51:19.055 --> 01:51:23.582
tavern. As you approach, you can already see
their-- Sorry, you wanted something?

01:51:23.582 --> 01:51:26.072
LIAM: Is Timoch and Ude on the way out?

01:51:26.072 --> 01:51:28.013

01:51:28.013 --> 01:51:29.172
LIAM: Maybe later.

01:51:29.172 --> 01:51:34.861
MATT: As you approach, there are two figures; one is a
large, burly orc and another that appears to be a

01:51:34.871 --> 01:51:38.595
bugbear, are dragging a body out from the front.

01:51:38.696 --> 01:51:39.763
MARISHA: What?

01:51:39.763 --> 01:51:41.011
TRAVIS: From the front of where?

01:51:41.011 --> 01:51:43.394
MATT: From inside of the Four Corners and they're
dragging it out onto the street.

01:51:43.394 --> 01:51:45.374
MARISHA: Like a dead body, or--?

01:51:45.374 --> 01:51:49.409
MATT: It's a limp body, and in a second, you can
see it's another orc.

01:51:49.672 --> 01:51:51.892
LIAM: Too much to drink, that one?

01:51:51.892 --> 01:51:56.733
MATT: You hear a chuckle, and they throw it to the
ground; and one of them slaps it in the face. The

01:51:56.733 --> 01:52:02.569
orc on the ground's face is just hamburger meat.
It is bloodied and the lip is split, and one of the eyes is

01:52:02.856 --> 01:52:08.997
swollen shut. There's spatters of his own blood
across the chest. They both sit there and look at

01:52:08.997 --> 01:52:16.443
him and it's like, "Poor bastard!" kick him in the
side, (grunt) "Wake up!" and he goes and takes a

01:52:16.443 --> 01:52:20.738
tankard that the bugbear was holding in the other
hand and pours it over his face. The orc on the

01:52:20.738 --> 01:52:29.780
ground goes, (gasping, coughing) "Did I win?"
They're like, "Piss off, we lost money on you!"

01:52:29.780 --> 01:52:35.781
and they walk back inside and leave the orc there
on the ground, dazed. There's chatter and

01:52:35.781 --> 01:52:40.948
discussion and conversation and chuckles, guttural
voices and high-pitched voices, and whiny

01:52:40.948 --> 01:52:49.186
laughter, and faint, discordant music, all
emanating from the open doorway to the Four

channel of your choice in the Twitch Prime realm.

The two realms have a pretty good working
relationship after that peace treaty the prime

I'm just going to let you--

01:59:02.357 --> 01:59:03.675
TALIESIN: Question six!

01:59:03.675 --> 01:59:06.632
MATT: Chicago's O'Hare airport is the country's
busiest. Which is the second busiest?

01:59:06.632 --> 01:59:07.860
TALIESIN: Dallas/Fort Worth.

01:59:07.860 --> 01:59:09.032
MATT: No!

01:59:09.032 --> 01:59:10.830
TALIESIN: (maniacal laughter)

01:59:10.830 --> 01:59:12.534
MATT: This is revenge for Soul Calibur, isn't it?

01:59:12.534 --> 01:59:13.981
TALIESIN: Oh man, I'm feeling it.

01:59:13.981 --> 01:59:15.435
MATT: Where was the first McDonald's hamburger
store--

01:59:15.435 --> 01:59:16.523
TALIESIN: Pasadena, California!

01:59:16.523 --> 01:59:19.020
MATT: (frustrated growl) We're playing Street
Fighter after this.

01:59:19.121 --> 01:59:24.536
TALIESIN: Goddamn it. This dragon is
apparently my bro.

01:59:24.536 --> 01:59:25.488
MATT: Apparently.

01:59:25.488 --> 01:59:27.985
TALIESIN: Because that was <i>so</i> leaning in my
direction there. That was hard.

01:59:27.985 --> 01:59:30.978
(laughter)

01:59:31.907 --> 01:59:57.924
[chill music]

01:59:57.924 --> 01:59:59.846
MARISHA: Like that?

02:00:01.761 --> 02:00:03.073
BABS: (sigh)

02:00:24.015 --> 02:12:04.089
[music]

02:12:04.089 --> 02:12:08.162
MATT: And welcome back, everybody. Before we jump
back in, we do have a winner tonight. The winner

02:12:08.162 --> 02:12:16.727
is: 3nd720, 3 like number three, nd, 720!
Congratulations.

02:12:16.727 --> 02:12:18.003
MARISHA: It's a bot.

02:12:18.003 --> 02:12:20.924
MATT: It could be. They've chatted twice in our
chat room.

02:12:20.924 --> 02:12:22.681
TRAVIS: (robotic voice) Thank you for the
Wyrmwood.

02:12:22.681 --> 02:12:27.087
MATT: I guess second time's the charm, so
congratulations. We'll get this sent out to you

02:12:27.087 --> 02:12:39.382
ASAP. All right, bringing us back in; to Asarius.
You guys begin to step into the interior of the

02:12:39.382 --> 02:12:48.070
Four Corners. Immediately, you can see the arched,
barn-roof-type interior, a good 20 or so feet off

02:12:48.070 --> 02:12:53.134
the ground at its apex, and it is a central apex
that runs from the front to the back, with a

02:12:53.134 --> 02:12:59.593
somewhat-curved, barn-like top. There are rafters
pointed across, and there are different boxes and

02:12:59.593 --> 02:13:05.115
barrels placed up in the edges for storage
reasons. To your right, there is a bar being run

02:13:05.115 --> 02:13:12.842
by a somewhat jovial, grinning bugbear that has
mashed some sort of wax into very heavily-grown

02:13:12.842 --> 02:13:19.478
fur on the face, and pulled it into a tri-pointed
moustache/goatee appearance; but it's just a

02:13:19.478 --> 02:13:25.651
continuation of the fur. He is in mid
conversation. There are a good seven or eight

02:13:25.651 --> 02:13:32.250
tables scattered amongst the room, with candles on
them that are burned halfway down with wax

02:13:32.250 --> 02:13:40.514
splatters across the center. The room is filled
with all kinds of unique people. You see gnolls:

02:13:40.514 --> 02:13:43.753
one in the far corner and one to the far left,
sitting there with large tankards, drinking and

02:13:43.753 --> 02:13:51.271
conversing. Probably a half-dozen goblins or so,
scattered around the interior. Some orcs; a few

02:13:51.271 --> 02:14:00.485
Kryn drow in here as well. As you all step into
the interior chamber, the energy comes to a slight

02:14:00.485 --> 02:14:07.202
standstill as everyone looks over to the
brightly-colored and different individuals.

02:14:07.202 --> 02:14:08.504
TRAVIS: Beau.

02:14:08.504 --> 02:14:09.835
MARISHA: Yeah?

02:14:09.835 --> 02:14:12.782
TRAVIS: Punch me. (impact, groan)

02:14:12.782 --> 02:14:14.968
MATT: Okay.

02:14:14.968 --> 02:14:17.718
MARISHA: It was such an invitation, I couldn't--

02:14:17.718 --> 02:14:23.547
MATT: Yeah, it was. I'm not going to make you roll
martial arts damage, but your dex modifier is...?

02:14:23.547 --> 02:14:26.423
MARISHA: Just my dex mod? Plus five.

02:14:26.423 --> 02:14:28.219
MATT: You take six points of damage.

02:14:28.219 --> 02:14:29.684
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:14:29.684 --> 02:14:32.394
MATT: It clocks you.

02:14:32.394 --> 02:14:35.141
MARISHA: Sorry, I could have done
a little less fervor.

02:14:35.141 --> 02:14:36.287
TRAVIS: It's all right.

02:14:36.287 --> 02:14:37.163
MARISHA: Sorry.

02:14:37.163 --> 02:14:41.715
MATT: As you stop for a second, the whole crowd
raises an eyebrow or grumbles to themselves and

02:14:41.837 --> 02:14:44.637
chuckles, and they all go back to their business.

02:14:44.637 --> 02:14:47.103
MARISHA: Give them all a little bit
of the crazy eye.

02:14:47.103 --> 02:14:53.556
MATT: What you do notice also, is to the front
left of your entryway, a large portion of the

02:14:53.556 --> 02:15:02.641
central chamber on the far left corner is a gravel
pit. A 35-foot by 35-foot gravel pit that

02:15:02.641 --> 02:15:07.122
encompasses the center, and there is a chair set
at each corner of this pit.

02:15:07.122 --> 02:15:09.685
SAM: I'm sure it's for doing foley work,
or something.

02:15:09.685 --> 02:15:11.003
MATT: Yes.

02:15:11.003 --> 02:15:12.856
TALIESIN: Deep joke.

02:15:12.856 --> 02:15:16.991
MATT: You do see sections of the gravel seem to be
darkly stained.

02:15:17.881 --> 02:15:19.111
TRAVIS: Semen.

02:15:19.315 --> 02:15:30.048
MATT: Sitting in one of the chairs, you see a
really thick, muscular ogre. Most ogres you see

02:15:30.048 --> 02:15:39.109
are very muscular in general, but also carry a
rather hefty amount of thick ogre skin and fat

02:15:39.109 --> 02:15:48.223
that also makes them a walking powerhouse, or
sledgehammer. This is a pretty cut ogre. You can

02:15:48.223 --> 02:15:53.395
see a lot of muscle definition, and it's currently
removing wraps from his hands where there are

02:15:53.395 --> 02:16:03.067
blood stains across it. You see two other
individuals, two gnolls that are currently having

02:16:03.067 --> 02:16:08.749
fresh drinks poured into their glasses and mugs,
as they themselves are beat to shit.

02:16:08.749 --> 02:16:10.807
LAURA: In the other chairs?

02:16:10.807 --> 02:16:11.787
MATT: What's that?

02:16:11.787 --> 02:16:13.852
LAURA: Like, are they in the other chairs?

02:16:13.852 --> 02:16:17.317
MATT: They are no longer in the chairs on the
other side of the ring. They're over at nearby

02:16:17.317 --> 02:16:22.540
tables, and they're currently being consoled by
their friends and such. The ogre that's there,

02:16:22.540 --> 02:16:32.401
there's a pile in the center of the gravel pit
that is a combination of gold coins, jerky, some

02:16:32.401 --> 02:16:43.562
sort of a locket, as well as a raw piece of ore.
It's just a small pile of loose pocket treasures.

02:16:43.562 --> 02:16:49.024
As soon as the ogre finishes unwrapping its
wrappings on its hands, it walks over and scoops

02:16:49.024 --> 02:16:54.564
it up, as well as a nice helping of gravel, into a
pouch. He goes off and orders a drink.

02:16:55.844 --> 02:16:58.178
MARISHA: Did you see that guy?

02:16:58.340 --> 02:17:00.365
SAM: Yeah, he's a fighter.

02:17:00.365 --> 02:17:02.291
MARISHA: I want to be his friend.

02:17:02.291 --> 02:17:03.710
SAM: His friend, I--

02:17:03.710 --> 02:17:10.680
MARISHA: I'm going to go up to the bar. I sit
down. I'll buy you that drink.

02:17:10.680 --> 02:17:12.335
MATT: You say this to ogre?

02:17:12.335 --> 02:17:13.684
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:17:13.684 --> 02:17:21.926
MATT: Okay. The ogre is leaning forward, and you
come up to about the waist of this ogre. The guy's

02:17:21.926 --> 02:17:27.429
almost bending at a 45-degree angle to rest his
shoulders on the edge of the bar, and as soon as

02:17:27.429 --> 02:17:31.411
you say this, the head twitches a little bit to
hear you, and then just continues to ignore you,

02:17:31.411 --> 02:17:38.255
staring ahead at the bartender who is in the
process of getting a pretty hefty cask from

02:17:38.255 --> 02:17:44.186
underneath the bar and bringing it up on top. The
bartender, the bugbear, glances over at you and

02:17:44.186 --> 02:17:48.989
gives you a look, a little wink, and continues to
prepare to pop it while the ogre shoves this

02:17:48.989 --> 02:17:55.374
large, dinged-to-shit tankard, that was previously
attached to the side of his belt, forward toward

02:17:55.374 --> 02:17:58.683
the bartender, and continues to not acknowledge
your existence.

02:17:58.683 --> 02:18:09.628
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. Not a bad night of work, huh?
It's pretty good. Sad I missed the fight.

02:18:10.748 --> 02:18:18.414
MATT: "Stick around. There's always more." Doesn't
even look at you, just keeps looking forward.

02:18:18.414 --> 02:18:21.230
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Stick around, there's always
more.

02:18:22.673 --> 02:18:26.879
MARISHA: How do you throw your hat in the ring for
something like that?

02:18:26.879 --> 02:18:35.420
MATT: Now the head turns towards you, and you can
see one of the eyes is destroyed. The right eye in

02:18:35.420 --> 02:18:43.774
the head, it looks like it's taken some heavy
damage, and has healed back enough to not become a

02:18:43.774 --> 02:18:51.772
necrotic problem, but the iris is split and it's
not a functional eye; it's ruined. It doesn't move

02:18:51.772 --> 02:18:57.222
in the socket. The other eye shifts over towards
you, and the jaw on this ogre is a series of heavy

02:18:57.222 --> 02:19:02.824
scars where it's been split in three different
places and healed back over. A broken, jagged row

02:19:02.824 --> 02:19:13.025
of teeth and curved tusks tangle outside of the
lower jaw. You see sprigs of attempted chin hair

02:19:13.025 --> 02:19:20.080
that end up being just a tuft of just seven or
eight longer hairs that tangle into this awkward,

02:19:20.080 --> 02:19:27.072
thin braid or lock that just drifts, and taps the
edge of the top of the clavicle as the head shifts

02:19:27.072 --> 02:19:36.010
and looks towards you, and he says, "If you're
looking to enter, just drop your ante." He points

02:19:36.010 --> 02:19:43.032
back to the gravel pit. "I'd be happy to
take it from you."

02:19:43.032 --> 02:19:47.768
MARISHA: You going to be fighting next? Is it like
a reigning champion type of thing?

02:19:47.768 --> 02:19:58.087
MATT: "No. Whoever wants the ante can enter.
So if I don't like what you drop,

02:19:58.087 --> 02:20:01.693
"I leave it to the riff-raff."

02:20:02.709 --> 02:20:06.536
MARISHA: And everyone else is the riff raff,
not you, though.

02:20:06.536 --> 02:20:10.542
MATT: (sniffs) "You smell like human."

02:20:10.542 --> 02:20:15.464
MARISHA: Wow, you're very astute.
That's accurate.

02:20:15.464 --> 02:20:19.484
MATT: "It's a terrible smell."

02:20:19.484 --> 02:20:23.525
MARISHA: Yeah, I've heard that before. Jesus,
okay. Come on, man.

02:20:23.525 --> 02:20:27.323
MATT: "Makes me hungry."

02:20:27.323 --> 02:20:33.320
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to ignore that, and I
have one more question for you.

02:20:33.320 --> 02:20:38.867
MATT: "No more questions," and he turns back and
takes the tankard from the bar, now filled, tosses

02:20:38.867 --> 02:20:42.121
a couple of silver pieces over the bar towards the
bartender from the winnings that he pulled out

02:20:42.121 --> 02:20:47.282
from the center of the gravel pit
and just stomps.

02:20:47.282 --> 02:20:49.779
MARISHA: I'll fight you for a question.

02:20:49.779 --> 02:20:51.411
MATT: Just sits down and keeps drinking.

02:20:51.411 --> 02:20:54.744
MARISHA: Fuck. I'll fucking get a drink and get
back over.

02:20:54.744 --> 02:20:57.910
LAURA: What were you going to ask him?

02:20:57.910 --> 02:21:00.409
MARISHA: Wanted to hear if he's been having
nightmares.

02:21:00.409 --> 02:21:02.248
LAURA: Oh.

02:21:02.248 --> 02:21:03.781
SAM: She's a good detective.

02:21:03.781 --> 02:21:06.953
LAURA: I thought she was going to ask him out or
something. It was weird.

02:21:06.953 --> 02:21:08.493
LIAM: You did? Really?

02:21:08.493 --> 02:21:10.231
TALIESIN: I wasn't aware that was an option.

02:21:10.231 --> 02:21:12.494
MARISHA: He did say I smelled very nice.

02:21:12.494 --> 02:21:15.934
LAURA: He said you made him hungry, I heard it.

02:21:15.934 --> 02:21:18.860
MARISHA: Yeah. I have that effect on people,
sometimes.

02:21:18.860 --> 02:21:22.357
SAM: Nicely done. Ooh.

02:21:22.357 --> 02:21:26.902
MATT: The bartender sits there waiting. The
bugbear goes, "Hey. Hey, you want something?"

02:21:26.902 --> 02:21:30.557
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll just get an ale.

02:21:30.557 --> 02:21:34.253
MATT: "All right. What's your name?"

02:21:34.253 --> 02:21:35.748
MARISHA: What's yours?

02:21:35.748 --> 02:21:38.818
MATT: "Resk. Resk the Mad. What's your name?"

02:21:38.818 --> 02:21:39.797
MARISHA: Risk the Mad?

02:21:39.797 --> 02:21:41.022
MATT: "Resk!"

02:21:41.022 --> 02:21:42.325
MARISHA: Resk.

02:21:42.325 --> 02:21:45.290
MATT: "Yeah, that's the one."

02:21:45.290 --> 02:21:55.042
MARISHA: Okay, Resk. I'm Beau.
Beau the Sane... currently.

02:21:55.042 --> 02:22:02.874
MATT: "For now. One ale coming up." It turns
around and goes and starts pouring.

02:22:02.874 --> 02:22:04.542
MARISHA: What made you mad?

02:22:04.542 --> 02:22:06.719
MATT: "Ha. Lots of things."

02:22:06.719 --> 02:22:10.419
MARISHA: What's the most recent?

02:22:10.419 --> 02:22:15.183
MATT: "Lots of questions. Makes me real mad."

02:22:15.183 --> 02:22:21.505
MARISHA: Oh, questions make you mad. Okay. Why
does everyone here-- it feels like they're hitting

02:22:21.505 --> 02:22:24.387
on me, but also insulting me at the same time?

02:22:24.387 --> 02:22:28.638
LIAM: It is so blatantly obvious that Beauregard
is going to start a bar brawl in here. I'm pulling

02:22:28.638 --> 02:22:31.141
my cloak over to hide my person.

02:22:31.851 --> 02:22:35.213
LAURA: I think people here don't like answering
questions, Beau.

02:22:35.345 --> 02:22:37.346
SAM: Yeah, a City of Beasts thing.

02:22:39.436 --> 02:22:43.257
TALIESIN: Maybe ask him why people don't like
answering questions. That might shed some

02:22:43.408 --> 02:22:44.848
illumination on the problem.

02:22:44.848 --> 02:22:46.426
MARISHA: It's still a question, though.

02:22:46.426 --> 02:22:47.980
TALIESIN: Oh.

02:22:47.980 --> 02:22:52.217
TRAVIS: Is there anyone sitting in this whole
place that's at a table by themselves, maybe like--

02:22:52.217 --> 02:22:54.546
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:22:54.546 --> 02:22:59.810
TRAVIS: Yeah. 20-- 21.

02:22:59.810 --> 02:23:07.392
MATT: Okay. Most of the tables are fairly busy.
There is one table on the far right side, back

02:23:07.392 --> 02:23:14.489
end. It's a smaller table, and there's only one
individual sitting there. It is a drow. It is a

02:23:14.489 --> 02:23:25.779
female drow, dark, black hair across the light
blue-gray skin tone. Hair is pulled back into a

02:23:25.779 --> 02:23:33.316
very, very tight ponytail that is then
multiple-times bound, so it's almost like a series

02:23:33.316 --> 02:23:40.418
of periodic bindings to where it drags the lower
back. Flowing clothes, no Kryn armor necessarily,

02:23:40.559 --> 02:23:46.657
so you don't get the sense that this is a soldier
of the military, and is currently clutching hands

02:23:46.657 --> 02:23:50.339
around a drink and just staring right at Beau.

02:23:56.309 --> 02:24:04.242
TRAVIS: Your actions have garnered some attention.
Ten o'clock, back of the room.

02:24:05.342 --> 02:24:09.456
MARISHA: I turn around, look at him. Her?

02:24:09.456 --> 02:24:10.547
LIAM: It's a lady.

02:24:10.547 --> 02:24:11.714
MARISHA: It's a lady? Sorry.

02:24:11.714 --> 02:24:13.084
SAM: Should we go talk to her?

02:24:13.084 --> 02:24:13.938
TRAVIS: No.

02:24:13.938 --> 02:24:15.674
SAM: What do you mean? Yes! We are
here for information.

02:24:15.674 --> 02:24:17.902
LAURA: Maybe your smell is making her hungry.

02:24:17.902 --> 02:24:20.306
MARISHA: I'm telling you! Everyone is horny over
me here.

02:24:20.306 --> 02:24:23.312
TALIESIN: It occurs to me that I'm hungry. I'm
going to order some food. My god--

02:24:23.312 --> 02:24:24.909
I'm going to go to the bar.

02:24:24.909 --> 02:24:26.252
SAM: We are here for information.

02:24:26.252 --> 02:24:28.041
MATT: (laughs) "Nice to meet you!"

02:24:28.041 --> 02:24:29.258
TALIESIN: Nice to meet you.

02:24:29.258 --> 02:24:31.318
MATT: "Oh, you are just an interesting one,
aren't you?

02:24:31.318 --> 02:24:32.943
TALIESIN: Oh, you are the first person
to say that!

02:24:32.943 --> 02:24:34.661
MATT: "I like the colors, you are very bright."

02:24:34.661 --> 02:24:36.025
TALIESIN: Thank you. I try.

02:24:36.025 --> 02:24:37.677
MATT: "All right. Okay. You hungry?"

02:24:37.677 --> 02:24:40.828
TALIESIN: Yeah, whatever you've got in the
kitchen, I think I'd love to feed my friends and

02:24:40.828 --> 02:24:45.969
have a fine meal. Especially if you have any-- if
we can get an assortment of meats and vegetables,

02:24:45.969 --> 02:24:47.274
would be really great.

02:24:47.274 --> 02:24:48.394
MATT: "Like a breakfast spread."

02:24:48.394 --> 02:24:49.551
TALIESIN: Like a breakfast spread.

02:24:49.551 --> 02:24:55.464
MATT: "All right. Hold on, just a second. Get the
breakfast spread! I'm right, on it." You notice as

02:24:55.464 --> 02:25:01.247
he talks, he shouts an order to himself and then
responds from the other side and goes off and

02:25:01.247 --> 02:25:06.446
starts making food out of the small kitchen shack
that's attached to the outside of the barn.

02:25:06.446 --> 02:25:08.038
LIAM: He's just talked to himself, you're saying?

02:25:08.038 --> 02:25:08.814
MATT: Yeah.

02:25:08.814 --> 02:25:10.914
TALIESIN: I think there's two people in one
right there.

02:25:10.914 --> 02:25:12.999
MARISHA: He's the Mad-- Never mind.

02:25:12.999 --> 02:25:16.366
TALIESIN: I thought he was just angry at you. I
mean, people seem to be, on occasion.

02:25:16.366 --> 02:25:23.185
MARISHA: Oh okay, everyone's in a mood. I'm going
to go over to the drow.

02:25:23.185 --> 02:25:26.452
SAM: I'm going to tag along, a little behind.

02:25:26.452 --> 02:25:28.477
TALIESIN: I'm going to wait for breakfast.

02:25:28.477 --> 02:25:31.909
LIAM: She's Captain Heat and we are the one
who is in the mood.

02:25:31.909 --> 02:25:34.071
MARISHA: I'll take that one.

02:25:34.071 --> 02:25:36.373
MATT: You sit back at the table.

02:25:36.373 --> 02:25:40.893
MARISHA: I sit down. This seat taken?

02:25:40.893 --> 02:25:43.363
MATT: "It is now."

02:25:43.363 --> 02:25:45.476
MARISHA: Correct answer.

02:25:53.103 --> 02:25:55.902
It's been cold, I'm not used to this.

02:25:55.902 --> 02:25:58.134
MATT: "Where are you from?"

02:25:58.134 --> 02:26:00.540
MARISHA: Where are <i>you</i> from?

02:26:02.450 --> 02:26:04.055
MATT: She starts drinking.

02:26:08.016 --> 02:26:18.510
MARISHA: A little bit further south.
Traveling, touring.

02:26:19.864 --> 02:26:22.350
MATT: "What is your destination?"

02:26:23.060 --> 02:26:25.068
MARISHA: Currently, it's this barn.

02:26:26.520 --> 02:26:28.773
MATT: "Well, congratulations, you made it."

02:26:28.773 --> 02:26:32.774
MARISHA: I did. Feel pretty good about that, too.

02:26:32.774 --> 02:26:34.251
MATT: "You should."

02:26:38.267 --> 02:26:41.135
MARISHA: Looking for someone, though.

02:26:43.097 --> 02:26:45.455
MATT: "Then I hope you find them."

02:26:47.106 --> 02:26:50.210
MARISHA: Seems like a lot of people are missing
these days.

02:26:50.210 --> 02:26:53.258
MATT: "Dangerous places, these fields."

02:26:54.004 --> 02:26:55.347
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

02:27:07.791 --> 02:27:08.602
Some--

02:27:08.602 --> 02:27:10.850
MATT: Grabs the drinks and stands up
and walks away.

02:27:12.442 --> 02:27:15.306
MARISHA: (whispering) Fucking shit.

02:27:15.306 --> 02:27:26.226
SAM: As they go past, can I just try to brush
up against them, and just see if I can--

02:27:26.226 --> 02:27:28.891
are they holding anything in their pouches?

02:27:28.891 --> 02:27:30.700
MATT: They have some pouches, yeah.

02:27:30.700 --> 02:27:32.553
SAM: I'm just going to try to pick a pocket.

02:27:32.553 --> 02:27:34.100
MATT: Okay, go for it.

02:27:34.100 --> 02:27:36.608
TRAVIS: Goddamn it. That's the beginning
of the end.

02:27:36.608 --> 02:27:38.145
MARISHA: Do it!

02:27:38.888 --> 02:27:39.888
TRAVIS: Fuck.

02:27:39.888 --> 02:27:48.085
SAM: Sleight of hand, 29. Just a random pocket,
I'm not going for anything in particular.

02:27:48.234 --> 02:27:54.546
MATT: Okay, all right. You reach up and not even
looking reach. It takes a second for your fingers

02:27:54.546 --> 02:28:01.837
to find a pouch, but something cylindrical and
cold finds your grasp. You pull it outside and

02:28:01.837 --> 02:28:07.207
dart off, and no one seems to make
any note of you.

02:28:07.207 --> 02:28:12.327
SAM: When I touched its form it seemed all there?
No illusions or anything?

02:28:12.327 --> 02:28:15.940
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:28:17.448 --> 02:28:18.404
SAM: Five.

02:28:18.404 --> 02:28:21.244
MATT: Five? Seemed all there.

02:28:21.244 --> 02:28:27.165
MARISHA: Did I get any type of feeling on what she
was looking for when she was staring through my soul?

02:28:27.165 --> 02:28:28.691
MATT: Make an insight check.

02:28:32.229 --> 02:28:34.415
MARISHA: All right, all right. 18.

02:28:34.514 --> 02:28:45.627
MATT: 18? Hard to read the true length and breadth
of the intent, but seemed to be genuinely taken

02:28:45.627 --> 02:28:55.970
aback that you were here, like a human like you.
You can't tell if it was an offense or something

02:28:55.970 --> 02:28:57.963
more sinister, you don't know.

02:28:57.963 --> 02:29:00.005
LIAM: Does she leave Beau or the whole
establishment?

02:29:00.005 --> 02:29:04.232
MATT: Left Beau, just moved over to back wall and
is now, after passing by Nott, is just leaning in

02:29:04.232 --> 02:29:08.814
the back wall with the tankard and is still
keeping a side eye towards Beau.

02:29:08.814 --> 02:29:11.257
MARISHA: I go back to the group.

02:29:11.580 --> 02:29:14.368
LIAM: Did you make her so horny that she had to go
relieve herself?

02:29:14.368 --> 02:29:16.989
MARISHA: Pretty sure she wants to kill me.

02:29:16.989 --> 02:29:21.187
SAM: Not near the group, I will
look at what I got.

02:29:21.551 --> 02:29:23.180
MATT: It's a greater healing potion.

02:29:23.180 --> 02:29:24.491
SAM: Oh, okay!

02:29:24.491 --> 02:29:25.827
LAURA: Sweet.

02:29:25.827 --> 02:29:27.176
SAM: I'll take that.

02:29:27.176 --> 02:29:28.873
LAURA: No, that's mine!

02:29:28.873 --> 02:29:30.823
TRAVIS: That's legit.

02:29:30.823 --> 02:29:32.851
MATT: Here, pass it over.

02:29:35.311 --> 02:29:36.669
LAURA: Sick.

02:29:36.831 --> 02:29:44.412
SAM: Do you think we should go talk to her again?
First of all, what are we doing here?

02:29:44.412 --> 02:29:47.489
TRAVIS: I'll make my way over to where
she is standing, too.

02:29:47.489 --> 02:29:49.241
SAM: Wait, you're going to go talk to her?
Wait! Don't--

02:29:49.241 --> 02:29:51.369
LIAM: We are going to corner this one wom--
oh, okay.

02:29:51.369 --> 02:29:53.481
SAM: I'm going to go near and just watch.

02:29:53.481 --> 02:29:54.791
MATT: Okay.

02:29:56.114 --> 02:30:03.697
TRAVIS: As I start making my way over, I have a
bit of a (hiccup, slurring) sway in my swagger. I

02:30:03.697 --> 02:30:12.953
get near her table and I'll trip and fall into the
chair. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Hey.

02:30:12.953 --> 02:30:15.032
MATT: "Hello."

02:30:17.452 --> 02:30:21.185
TRAVIS: What's your name? (hiccup)

02:30:22.995 --> 02:30:25.161
MATT: "You want to know my name?"

02:30:27.481 --> 02:30:33.644
TRAVIS: I'm sorry. (hiccup) I probably shouldn't
ask. Seems like more trouble than it's worth.

02:30:33.644 --> 02:30:38.992
MATT: "It always is. If you want to know,
throw something in the ring."

02:30:40.612 --> 02:30:44.189
TRAVIS: Are you-- (hiccup) are you a fighter?

02:30:44.189 --> 02:30:47.419
MATT: "I have been known to throw a fist
every now and then."

02:30:47.419 --> 02:30:52.083
TRAVIS: I don't need any more of that. Did you
see that filthy fucking human punch me

02:30:52.083 --> 02:30:54.943
right in my goddamn kisser? (snort)

02:30:54.943 --> 02:30:57.707
MATT: "I did. Did you deserve it?"

02:30:57.707 --> 02:31:01.399
TRAVIS: (softly) I can't remember. (laughs)

02:31:01.399 --> 02:31:03.877
MATT: (sigh)

02:31:04.102 --> 02:31:08.841
TRAVIS: What is one of them doing in a place like
this? Can you believe it? (hiccup)

02:31:11.321 --> 02:31:14.400
MATT: Steps over and walks away from you
to the other side.

02:31:14.770 --> 02:31:15.573
TALIESIN: So proud.

02:31:16.165 --> 02:31:17.757
SAM: You guys suck.

02:31:20.932 --> 02:31:25.263
TRAVIS: I'll sit down in her chair, look at the
group and be like.

02:31:27.183 --> 02:31:31.097
SAM: It sounds like if we want to talk to this
lady, you're going to have to beat her up.

02:31:31.097 --> 02:31:32.194
MARISHA: I have a thought.

02:31:32.194 --> 02:31:33.127
SAM: Okay.

02:31:33.127 --> 02:31:35.804
MARISHA: I think to get any amount of fucking
respect in here, we're going to have to

02:31:35.804 --> 02:31:36.693
beat some fucking ass.

02:31:36.693 --> 02:31:38.528
SAM: Yeah, yeah!

02:31:38.528 --> 02:31:42.329
MARISHA: I'm willing to do it. I think it's a
fisticuffs thing. I think it's a no-armor thing.

02:31:42.329 --> 02:31:45.184
LAURA: I think it's four people
against each other.

02:31:45.184 --> 02:31:54.807
MARISHA: So you join me. But we don't really
tell-- you know, we don't project that we're

02:31:54.807 --> 02:31:56.920
necessarily fighting each other.

02:31:57.020 --> 02:31:58.692
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

02:31:58.692 --> 02:32:01.396
TRAVIS: Yasha just quietly goes (cough).

02:32:02.042 --> 02:32:07.117
MATT: Actually, Yasha honestly right now is
looking uncomfortable.

02:32:07.117 --> 02:32:09.708
TRAVIS: (quietly) Oh, fuck.

02:32:09.708 --> 02:32:19.503
MATT: Genuinely is like, "Normally I'd be into
this kind of thing, but maybe not here." She's

02:32:19.503 --> 02:32:21.874
looking around the room nervously.

02:32:21.874 --> 02:32:24.727
LAURA: Is everything okay, Yasha?

02:32:24.727 --> 02:32:34.406
MATT: "Yeah. Just, you know, I... This is where
I'm from, and maybe don't want to make a scene."

02:32:34.406 --> 02:32:37.190
MARISHA: Oh fuck, are we embarrassing you?
(whispering) Are we those people?

02:32:37.190 --> 02:32:38.586
SAM: We are those people, yes.

02:32:38.586 --> 02:32:40.274
LAURA: Obviously.

02:32:40.274 --> 02:32:46.635
SAM: But it's fine. Your plan was fine. You and
Jester fight. You'll win. It'll just be down to

02:32:46.635 --> 02:32:50.970
you and you. One of you throws the fight, I
assume. Maybe you should work that out

02:32:50.970 --> 02:32:55.642
ahead of time. Then we'll get tons of respect
and we'll ask all our questions.

02:32:55.642 --> 02:32:58.547
LIAM: Please, you're about to have an embolism.
Throw something in there, and start fighting.

02:32:58.547 --> 02:33:04.928
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's not think about these things
too much. (loudly) Show me what you've got!

02:33:07.360 --> 02:33:10.759
MARISHA: Fuck. I take...

02:33:11.107 --> 02:33:15.354
LIAM: Here. I pull one of those jade stones and I
slap it into Beauregard's hand. Use this.

02:33:15.354 --> 02:33:17.162
MATT: How many jade stones do you have?

02:33:17.162 --> 02:33:18.106
LIAM: Four.

02:33:18.106 --> 02:33:19.005
MATT: Four? There you go.

02:33:19.005 --> 02:33:20.148
LIAM: I had four.

02:33:20.148 --> 02:33:21.184
MATT: Now you have two.

02:33:21.184 --> 02:33:22.537
LIAM: I have two and I gave her one.

02:33:22.615 --> 02:33:23.376
MATT: All right.

02:33:23.376 --> 02:33:29.485
MARISHA: Then I'll take one of my several pouches
that I bought, fill it with like...

02:33:29.485 --> 02:33:33.201
what seems right? What seems good?

02:33:33.201 --> 02:33:35.269
LIAM: A jade stone worth 100 gold pieces.

02:33:35.269 --> 02:33:37.017
SAM: Yeah, that's plenty.

02:33:37.017 --> 02:33:39.970
LAURA: That's so much. That's way too much.
Just use the stone.

02:33:39.970 --> 02:33:41.736
TRAVIS: You want some bloody manacles?

02:33:41.736 --> 02:33:43.837
LAURA: But look, somebody just put a locket in
there and he like...

02:33:43.837 --> 02:33:45.518
TRAVIS: There's a crossbow.

02:33:45.518 --> 02:33:49.839
MARISHA: I'll throw another ten gold, and I take
the bloody manacles because that seems hardcore.

02:33:49.839 --> 02:33:51.770
MATT: (laughs) Okay.

02:33:51.770 --> 02:33:54.278
MARISHA: Bloody manacles, gold, jade piece
(clinks).

02:33:54.278 --> 02:33:56.574
MATT: So you step out into the open gravel pit.
(heavy footsteps)

02:33:56.574 --> 02:33:59.568
MARISHA: Fuck. Oh fuck, oh wait. Okay--

02:33:59.568 --> 02:34:06.900
LAURA: Oh god, we should team up and then--
(hushed) when it's just us then we... you know.

02:34:06.900 --> 02:34:12.216
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Who wants to throw?
Should we go based on like how it's going?

02:34:12.216 --> 02:34:13.984
LAURA: (whispering) I'll throw it to you.

02:34:13.984 --> 02:34:15.158
MARISHA: Okay.

02:34:15.158 --> 02:34:21.111
MATT: So you walk out on your own and drop the
contents of your hand into the center (thudding

02:34:21.111 --> 02:34:28.213
and jingling) in the middle of the gravel. At
which point about seven different characters in

02:34:28.213 --> 02:34:33.712
the interior of the Four Corners sit up and look
over in the direction.

02:34:34.483 --> 02:34:36.229
LAURA: I go take a seat.

02:34:36.229 --> 02:34:37.858
MATT: You go take a seat?

02:34:37.858 --> 02:34:38.778
LAURA: In the thing.

02:34:38.778 --> 02:34:39.731
SAM: In the chair?

02:34:39.731 --> 02:34:41.065
LAURA: In one of the chairs.

02:34:41.065 --> 02:34:47.859
MATT: Okay. You sit in one of the chairs. You
watch as the ogre that you had approached at the

02:34:47.859 --> 02:34:58.391
bar (laughs, cracks his neck), pushes past two of
the orcs and makes his way to the gravel pit.

02:34:58.391 --> 02:35:05.083
Reaches and grabs the bag of recent winnings and
looking at you, throws it on top of your ante in

02:35:05.083 --> 02:35:10.372
the center and walks over to where you're sitting
and goes, "Move out of my chair."

02:35:10.372 --> 02:35:16.709
LAURA: Oh. I stand up, and I pull out a sequined
glove, and put it in the middle.

02:35:16.709 --> 02:35:19.921
Then I go sit in another chair.

02:35:19.921 --> 02:35:21.689
MATT: (laughs) What is the sequined glove?

02:35:21.689 --> 02:35:26.897
LAURA: The single, white, sequined glove was my
stupid artifact that I started the campaign with.

02:35:26.897 --> 02:35:28.485
TALIESIN: Like Michael Jackson.

02:35:28.485 --> 02:35:30.030
LAURA: Yeah.

02:35:30.030 --> 02:35:32.090
MARISHA: Like he said, like a Michael Jackson
glove? That's amazing!

02:35:32.090 --> 02:35:36.214
MATT: As you drop your sequined glove, you see a
few faces of nearby onlookers. Like three goblins

02:35:36.214 --> 02:35:40.279
on the edge look in and go (eager panting, hmph).

02:35:41.220 --> 02:35:42.360
SAM: Maybe put some actual money--

02:35:42.360 --> 02:35:43.300
LAURA: It's magic.

02:35:43.300 --> 02:35:44.111
SAM: Oh, it's magic?!

02:35:44.111 --> 02:35:45.275
LAURA: It's magical.

02:35:45.275 --> 02:35:47.303
LIAM: (singing) Looking at the monk
in the mirror.

02:35:47.303 --> 02:35:49.780
SAM: Oh, it's magical everyone! It's magical!

02:35:49.780 --> 02:35:52.278
LIAM: But in like, a decorative sense.

02:35:52.278 --> 02:36:00.069
MATT: A green-scaled dragonborn in a breastplate
of armor, that looks themself a little bit drunk

02:36:00.069 --> 02:36:07.575
but is well-armed, sits up and begins walking
towards the gravel pit. Right before his foot

02:36:07.575 --> 02:36:14.601
touches the gravel, there's this blur of motion
and the drow female from earlier

02:36:14.601 --> 02:36:16.856
is now in the pit, cutting him off.

02:36:16.856 --> 02:36:18.265
TRAVIS: Oh, shit!

02:36:18.265 --> 02:36:19.609
LAURA: Oh god.

02:36:19.609 --> 02:36:21.145
SAM: (singing) Everybody wants Beau.

02:36:21.145 --> 02:36:22.720
LAURA: Don't let me down, okay?

02:36:22.720 --> 02:36:26.142
TALIESIN: What? I'm still waiting for breakfast.
I have no idea any of this is happening.

02:36:26.142 --> 02:36:27.512
MATT: Food begins to arrive for you.

02:36:27.512 --> 02:36:29.295
TALIESIN: Hey guys I got the-- oh.

02:36:30.615 --> 02:36:32.531
TRAVIS: (munching)

02:36:32.549 --> 02:36:35.593
TALIESIN: You're going to get your asses kicked,
you didn't eat.

02:36:37.021 --> 02:36:38.020
SAM: As everyone is preparing--

02:36:38.020 --> 02:36:39.383
TALIESIN: I bring it back to the table.

02:36:39.383 --> 02:36:43.260
SAM: I'm just going to cast Mage Hand. Just have
it invisible nearby. Just in case.

02:36:43.260 --> 02:36:44.939
MATT: Okay, sure.

02:36:44.939 --> 02:36:49.181
TALIESIN: I'll throw-- yeah.

02:36:50.155 --> 02:36:52.172
SAM: You're eating breakfast.

02:36:52.172 --> 02:36:53.817
TALIESIN: I'm eating breakfast.

02:36:53.912 --> 02:36:56.087
MATT: You're already eating breakfast. They're
already at the chairs. If you're going to cast

02:36:56.087 --> 02:36:58.574
anything you have to walk up to them
and do it visibly.

02:36:58.677 --> 02:37:01.000
TALIESIN: I don't think that's fair though,
is it?

02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:02.668
MATT: You can certainly try.

02:37:02.668 --> 02:37:05.201
TALIESIN: No, that doesn't seem fair.

02:37:05.201 --> 02:37:08.419
MARISHA: Take it from me: I've gotten thrown in
jail for that before.

02:37:08.419 --> 02:37:11.499
TALIESIN: Yeah, no. That sounds like cheating.

02:37:11.499 --> 02:37:18.297
MATT: All right. So it is Beauregard, the drow,
Jester still stands at the center-- or no, you're

02:37:18.297 --> 02:37:25.799
over in a chair and the ogre sits. The drow and
the ogre are now looking at Jester expectantly.

02:37:25.799 --> 02:37:35.224
LAURA: Oh come on. I put a glove in and stuff!
Hold on. I only have one thing that's worth anything.

02:37:35.224 --> 02:37:37.523
SAM: Do you need some money?

02:37:37.523 --> 02:37:40.253
LAURA: I pull out my diamond that I bought with
Caduceus.

02:37:40.253 --> 02:37:41.778
SAM: Oh.

02:37:41.778 --> 02:37:42.776
TALIESIN: That's a lot.

02:37:42.776 --> 02:37:43.940
LAURA: It's worth 300.

02:37:43.940 --> 02:37:44.907
SAM: Oh!

02:37:44.907 --> 02:37:46.282
TALIESIN: That's <i>a lot</i>.

02:37:46.282 --> 02:37:48.247
LAURA: I don't have anything else.

02:37:48.247 --> 02:37:49.977
MATT: Do you put the diamond in the center?

02:37:49.977 --> 02:37:51.193
TRAVIS: Jesus.

02:37:51.193 --> 02:37:52.321
LAURA: Is that too much?

02:37:52.321 --> 02:37:53.526
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:37:53.526 --> 02:37:54.652
SAM: Too late now.

02:37:54.652 --> 02:37:55.987
MATT: What are you doing, Jester?

02:37:55.987 --> 02:37:58.446
MARISHA: I'll win it back, just like they say
in Vegas.

02:37:58.446 --> 02:38:00.699
LAURA: I take my glove back, and put it on.

02:38:00.699 --> 02:38:02.220
SAM: Ooh, put it on!

02:38:02.220 --> 02:38:03.694
MATT: All right, you have a glove for the battle.

02:38:03.694 --> 02:38:04.863
LAURA: Shamone!

02:38:04.863 --> 02:38:09.612
MATT: When the diamond hits, everyone in the room
goes (gasp) and the ogre looks at you with this

02:38:09.612 --> 02:38:22.184
big grin and goes, "Heh heh heh." He then reaches
back and pulls a shortsword in his hand.

02:38:22.954 --> 02:38:24.953
MARISHA: Like, a shortsword?

02:38:25.051 --> 02:38:28.391
MATT: Yeah, well you notice at this point that
people who have been fighting, since you actually

02:38:28.391 --> 02:38:35.108
haven't seen a fight yet, it isn't necessarily
fisticuffs. At this point you realize the wounds

02:38:35.108 --> 02:38:39.553
that the others had sustained involved
puncture wounds, slash wounds.

02:38:39.553 --> 02:38:43.028
This is a whatever-weapons-goes-type brawl.

02:38:43.028 --> 02:38:44.982
LIAM: Oh, whatever goes, huh?

02:38:44.982 --> 02:38:47.275
MATT: Well, whatever goes from their perspective.

02:38:47.275 --> 02:38:53.588
MARISHA: So if Jester summons some unicorns,
people might get pissy? Is that--?

02:38:53.588 --> 02:38:56.037
MATT: Who knows? We'll find out.

02:38:56.037 --> 02:39:03.589
TRAVIS: We're going to find out. (yelling) We're
going to find out! Bring me the ring! Woo whee!

02:39:04.057 --> 02:39:08.122
SAM: I want Matt to bring out a kitty litter box
full up with sand right now.

02:39:08.122 --> 02:39:11.006
(chanting and table banging)

02:39:11.006 --> 02:39:15.143
LAURA: What should we do? Oh no! I am so out
my league in this ring!

02:39:15.143 --> 02:39:18.172
SAM: D&amp;D Beyond, everybody. Fine corporation.

02:39:18.172 --> 02:39:20.678
MARISHA: I don't know. Maybe we go for
the orc first?

02:39:20.678 --> 02:39:21.805
LAURA: It's huge!

02:39:21.805 --> 02:39:23.600
TRAVIS: Look at that ogre! Oh my god!

02:39:23.600 --> 02:39:27.302
SAM: Oh my god. The pit is most of the bar!

02:39:27.302 --> 02:39:29.424
LAURA: I am going to throw up.

02:39:29.424 --> 02:39:31.017
MARISHA: What have we done?

02:39:31.017 --> 02:39:33.007
LAURA: I'm going to lose a diamond.

02:39:33.007 --> 02:39:34.383
TRAVIS: Jester--

02:39:34.383 --> 02:39:35.926
LAURA: I don't have anything!

02:39:35.926 --> 02:39:37.759
LIAM: You got those houses so quick.

02:39:37.759 --> 02:39:40.011
TALIESIN: You could have thrown in, like 50 silver
would have done it.

02:39:40.011 --> 02:39:43.341
LIAM: We saw these together at Colville's joint.

02:39:43.341 --> 02:39:47.058
MATT: Were you guys just watching from the side
here? Found a separate table?

02:39:47.058 --> 02:39:48.721
TALIESIN: I was getting breakfast, man.

02:39:48.721 --> 02:39:50.260
TRAVIS: I'm sitting at the drow's table.

02:39:50.260 --> 02:39:53.385
MARISHA: I understand why they call it
the Four Corners!

02:39:53.385 --> 02:39:55.098
LAURA: Oh, cool.

02:39:55.098 --> 02:40:01.469
TALIESIN: I want to make sure I have 30 feet of
clearance for the whole thing, in case I have to

02:40:01.469 --> 02:40:05.089
start keeping people from getting beat to death.

02:40:05.089 --> 02:40:07.661
MATT: Caleb, where would you like to be?

02:40:07.661 --> 02:40:12.346
LIAM: I think I'll stand by the door right here,
near where Beauregard is.

02:40:13.506 --> 02:40:18.092
MATT: Yasha creeps over to this side, across the
other side of the door.

02:40:18.271 --> 02:40:19.857
TRAVIS: Are none of us over here?

02:40:19.857 --> 02:40:21.455
SAM: Yeah, I'm going to be over there.

02:40:21.455 --> 02:40:23.095
LIAM: It's crowded around my corner.

02:40:23.095 --> 02:40:26.846
MATT: It is. Caduceus, you're here.

02:40:26.846 --> 02:40:29.956
TALIESIN: As long as the whole thing is within 30
feet of me.

02:40:29.956 --> 02:40:33.066
MATT: You have to get closer for that, but right
now everyone is crowding up to the outside of the

02:40:33.066 --> 02:40:34.884
gravel pit.

02:40:34.884 --> 02:40:37.592
TALIESIN: I'll go join Caleb over there with
whatever breakfast I can manage.

02:40:37.592 --> 02:40:41.432
MARISHA: I don't think I've ever done a bar fight,
really. I don't think so.

02:40:41.432 --> 02:40:43.848
SAM: Teamwork makes the dream work here, guys.

02:40:43.848 --> 02:40:45.975
LIAM: Until it's just you two, and then: blood.

02:40:45.975 --> 02:40:47.652
LAURA: I don't think it's going to get to that.

02:40:47.652 --> 02:40:50.279
SAM: Kill her. No mercy.

02:40:50.279 --> 02:40:52.774
TRAVIS: Weapons, arms, legs, eyes.

02:40:52.774 --> 02:40:57.611
MATT: This goblin's going to move up. An actual
Kryn soldier comes up to the edge and starts

02:40:57.611 --> 02:41:05.107
watching. Hobgoblin steps up on a table over here.
They're all now moving in to form this space

02:41:05.107 --> 02:41:18.050
around. That being the case, I am going to need
everyone to roll initiative, please. By everyone,

02:41:18.050 --> 02:41:20.259
that would be Beauregard and Jester.

02:41:21.591 --> 02:41:24.991
MARISHA: Oh my god, Jessie! Come on, Laura.

02:41:25.381 --> 02:41:27.107
SAM: Yeah, terrible.

02:41:27.514 --> 02:41:29.995
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to use my boots.

02:41:29.995 --> 02:41:34.072
LAURA: Oh, we already used the dodecahedron
today.

02:41:36.942 --> 02:41:40.155
TRAVIS: It's all right. It's only whoever goes
first probably survives.

02:41:42.991 --> 02:41:45.894
TALIESIN: I'm not interfering with this fight.

02:41:46.636 --> 02:41:49.239
LIAM: I'm making no such promise.

02:41:50.029 --> 02:41:51.830
TALIESIN: I'll keep them alive.

02:41:57.962 --> 02:41:59.597
MATT: So, 25 to 20?

02:41:59.945 --> 02:42:01.168
MARISHA: 21.

02:42:01.168 --> 02:42:02.775
LAURA: Ooh, nice.

02:42:05.632 --> 02:42:06.904
MATT: 20 to 15?

02:42:09.228 --> 02:42:11.604
LAURA: Well, I'll just tell you. It's a nine.

02:42:11.604 --> 02:42:13.191
MATT: Okay, good to know.

02:42:13.191 --> 02:42:16.089
TRAVIS: <i>Nein</i>! Represent!

02:42:16.089 --> 02:42:18.647
LAURA: Lucky number nine.

02:42:18.647 --> 02:42:26.786
MATT: As everyone gathers around the edges and the
faint music begins to turn to a (drumming). One of

02:42:26.786 --> 02:42:32.131
the gnolls in the far back has begun to beat a
small drum that's kept to the side and the

02:42:32.131 --> 02:42:37.442
bartender, looking over in the back, pulls out a
small drum that he keeps behind the edge and he

02:42:37.442 --> 02:42:41.591
goes (light drumming), patting the top of this
tiny little thing.

02:42:41.820 --> 02:42:48.614
MARISHA: Before we get going, I take the bat guano
that Caleb gave me and smoosh it in my hands, and

02:42:48.614 --> 02:42:51.076
smear it across my face.

02:42:51.076 --> 02:42:52.614
MATT: That's disgusting.

02:42:52.614 --> 02:42:54.429
SAM: That's gross.

02:42:54.429 --> 02:42:56.286
LIAM: That's pretty fucking awesome.

02:42:56.286 --> 02:43:01.467
LAURA: I do some special sequined glove
flourishes. That's all.

02:43:01.467 --> 02:43:09.758
MATT: As you're doing that, the drow and the ogre,
everyone sizes each other up. There is a moment of

02:43:09.758 --> 02:43:12.867
a flinch, and you are first, Beau. What are you
doing?

02:43:12.867 --> 02:43:25.135
MARISHA: I go to the drow, in between the drow and
the ogre, butt in, and while running, pull my

02:43:25.135 --> 02:43:28.547
spear out and spin with a flourish and come
around.

02:43:28.547 --> 02:43:29.795
MATT: Your--?

02:43:29.795 --> 02:43:30.728
MARISHA: Staff.

02:43:30.728 --> 02:43:32.856
MATT: Staff, got you. Okay, go for it.
Towards the drow.

02:43:35.557 --> 02:43:37.683
MARISHA: Natural 19, so that is a--

02:43:37.683 --> 02:43:39.310
MATT: That does hit.

02:43:39.310 --> 02:43:48.923
MARISHA: Yeah? Okay, that's a 27. That hits. Oh my
god, I'm shaking. Eight damage.

02:43:48.923 --> 02:43:50.970
MATT: Eight points of damage.

02:43:50.970 --> 02:43:56.543
MARISHA: Stunning strike, going right for the
temple. Going for a quick knockout.

02:43:56.854 --> 02:44:00.065
MATT: That is going to be 14. What's the DC?

02:44:00.065 --> 02:44:01.890
MARISHA: 14.

02:44:01.890 --> 02:44:05.115
MATT: Crack! The drow looks back at you with an
angry expression.

02:44:05.230 --> 02:44:13.457
MARISHA: Doing that again, going for the other
side. Come on, bitch, that's not great. 15.

02:44:13.457 --> 02:44:20.039
MATT: You make a second strike with the staff.
This time, the drow seems to notice and ducks out

02:44:20.039 --> 02:44:24.424
of the way, and using a reaction to slam you right
into the face with its fist.

02:44:24.610 --> 02:44:26.065
TRAVIS: With its fist.

02:44:26.065 --> 02:44:27.555
MATT: Natural 20.

02:44:28.505 --> 02:44:30.113
SAM: Is she a monk, too?

02:44:30.495 --> 02:44:33.005
LIAM: Yes, she's got no armor on at all.

02:44:33.005 --> 02:44:34.821
SAM: Oh shit.

02:44:34.821 --> 02:44:43.905
MATT: That's 12 points of bludgeoning damage, and
I need you to make a constitution saving throw.

02:44:43.905 --> 02:44:47.033
MARISHA: She's totally a fucking monk.

02:44:47.033 --> 02:44:51.736
LAURA: Oh my god! This could be so bad!

02:44:51.736 --> 02:44:54.017
MARISHA: Constitution saving throw?

02:44:55.042 --> 02:45:04.747
TALIESIN: Weird question, is Sentinel at Death's
Door visible, or is it something I can do? There's

02:45:04.747 --> 02:45:09.946
nothing that says verbal, somatic, or otherwise.
Is it just my presence within 30 feet that makes

02:45:09.946 --> 02:45:12.880
something not happen?

02:45:12.880 --> 02:45:19.659
MATT: I would say, if you want to keep it low key,
because there is an action. It's not a high DC

02:45:19.659 --> 02:45:22.462
sleight of hand check to try to hide it if you
want to.

02:45:22.462 --> 02:45:24.124
MARISHA: What are you trying to do?

02:45:24.124 --> 02:45:30.682
TALIESIN: Cancel a Natural 20. No, it's too soon,
it feels like a cheat.

02:45:30.682 --> 02:45:31.679
MATT: What did you roll?

02:45:31.679 --> 02:45:32.812
MARISHA: Six.

02:45:32.812 --> 02:45:34.716
LAURA and SAM: Oh no.

02:45:34.716 --> 02:45:36.234
SAM: You're stunned.

02:45:36.234 --> 02:45:40.052
MATT: You feel the fist strike into your head,
and-- no, I'm sorry, the other one.

02:45:40.052 --> 02:45:43.214
MARISHA and LIAM: No, you can keep that, that's
fine.

02:45:43.214 --> 02:45:44.674
LIAM: No take backs.

02:45:44.674 --> 02:45:51.212
MATT: No, too bad. I'm used to placing this on the
enemy. All of a sudden, your entire world freezes

02:45:51.291 --> 02:45:56.950
in a flash of white and you hear ringing. What
little bit of vision you can see the outline of

02:45:56.950 --> 02:46:03.800
the interior of this tavern is trails in a blur.
You're stunned until the end of its next turn.

02:46:04.073 --> 02:46:06.467
TRAVIS: That's all right. You're good.

02:46:06.467 --> 02:46:09.550
MATT: I believe that's the end of your turn,
then.

02:46:09.550 --> 02:46:14.393
LAURA: That was just her turn, right? Now they're
both--

02:46:14.393 --> 02:46:16.841
MARISHA: But she did use her reaction.

02:46:16.841 --> 02:46:23.564
MATT: She did. Well, now it's her turn. She gets
her reaction back, and she's going around this way.

02:46:23.599 --> 02:46:26.101
MARISHA: I have a theory about all of this.

02:46:26.101 --> 02:46:29.314
MATT: She's going to make three attacks against
you.

02:46:29.314 --> 02:46:30.876
SAM: Three attacks?!

02:46:30.900 --> 02:46:32.443
LAURA: Against Beau?

02:46:32.443 --> 02:46:34.901
MATT: With advantage, because you're stunned.

02:46:34.901 --> 02:46:37.950
LAURA: That's a waste of a turn. Go after the ogre
first.

02:46:37.950 --> 02:46:39.681
SAM: Totally.

02:46:39.681 --> 02:46:41.816
LAURA: She's stunned, yeah.

02:46:44.706 --> 02:46:46.181
MATT: 27 to hit.

02:46:46.375 --> 02:46:48.156
TRAVIS: Hits.

02:46:48.156 --> 02:46:51.175
MATT: You take ten points of bludgeoning damage.

02:46:51.175 --> 02:46:52.938
TRAVIS: I got you.

02:46:54.508 --> 02:46:57.172
MATT: That's going to be 18 to hit.

02:46:57.203 --> 02:46:58.929
TRAVIS: Misses.

02:46:58.929 --> 02:47:05.118
MATT: In your stunned state you barely manage to
just barely budge out of another fist throw.

02:47:06.132 --> 02:47:09.217
Knowing it's not much of an issue, it's going to
move--

02:47:11.275 --> 02:47:12.820
LAURA: Why me?!

02:47:12.820 --> 02:47:20.846
MATT: Towards Jester. It's going to bonus action
attempt to strike you. That's going to be 15 to

02:47:20.846 --> 02:47:22.276
hit. I don't believe that hits.

02:47:22.276 --> 02:47:25.134
LAURA: I put my shield up and my sequined glove
comes up behind it.

02:47:25.134 --> 02:47:33.616
MATT: Her drow eyes look up and narrow for a
Flurry of Blows. Fourth attack. No, that's 13 to

02:47:33.616 --> 02:47:41.621
hit; it rolled really bad. It throws another punch
and you deflect with the shield. For the rest of

02:47:41.621 --> 02:47:46.871
its movement, it's going to shift over in this
direction. That finishes her turn. The ogre is now

02:47:46.871 --> 02:47:53.854
going to charge up toward both of you. He's going
to make a strike against each, making the first

02:47:53.854 --> 02:48:07.282
attack against the monk. That hits! Yeah, it's a
23. That is 11 points of slashing damage with one

02:48:07.282 --> 02:48:11.081
shortsword. It's going to attempt to make another
strike against you, Jester.

02:48:11.081 --> 02:48:12.424
LAURA: Okay.

02:48:14.452 --> 02:48:16.222
MATT: That is 21 to hit.

02:48:16.222 --> 02:48:18.490
LAURA: Yeah, that hits.

02:48:18.846 --> 02:48:25.377
MATT: You take 13 points of slashing damage from
the shortsword, slashes past from the other hand.

02:48:25.377 --> 02:48:28.874
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to use Hellish Rebuke.

02:48:29.105 --> 02:48:31.452
MATT: Go for it. Is it a constitution saving
throw?

02:48:31.452 --> 02:48:33.248
LAURA: It's a dex saving throw.

02:48:33.248 --> 02:48:34.384
MATT: Fails.

02:48:34.384 --> 02:48:36.344
LAURA: Yes! Okay, that's 3d10.

02:48:38.615 --> 02:48:41.571
Ooh, 17.

02:48:42.073 --> 02:48:50.195
MATT: As the ogre slashes both of you, chuckling,
goes for a second attack and then, suddenly, this

02:48:50.195 --> 02:48:54.914
burst of ice shards goes blasting into its face.
You see bits of it sticking out in the neck

02:48:54.914 --> 02:48:56.743
and under the jaw.

02:48:56.743 --> 02:48:58.533
LAURA: Holla!

02:49:01.366 --> 02:49:05.661
MATT: All right, that's going to end the ogre's
turn. That brings us to you, Jester.

02:49:05.661 --> 02:49:08.677
LAURA: That's me! Okay. Oh, I'm surrounded.

02:49:08.677 --> 02:49:12.468
MATT: You're pushed into the corner and surrounded
while Beau on the other end is hand against the

02:49:12.468 --> 02:49:16.363
wall, trying to regain her state of mind.

02:49:16.639 --> 02:49:21.968
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to cast--

02:49:23.565 --> 02:49:27.892
MATT: End of next turn, you are technically no
longer stunned, actually. Since the end of the

02:49:27.892 --> 02:49:33.261
monk's turn-- as I recall, the stun only lasts
until the end of their next turn, and

02:49:33.261 --> 02:49:35.747
she did stun you after--

02:49:35.747 --> 02:49:39.092
LAURA: I'm going to cast Command at 2nd level.

02:49:39.092 --> 02:49:47.867
MATT: You're going to cast Command? Okay. Let me
see here, just double checking. End of their next

02:49:47.867 --> 02:49:50.056
turn, yeah, so you are no longer stunned.

02:49:50.056 --> 02:49:51.351
SAM: Oh, wow.

02:49:51.938 --> 02:49:56.591
MARISHA: Okay. That's actually a good thing to
remember: don't stun people on your reaction.

02:49:56.591 --> 02:49:58.796
Not if you're up next.

02:49:58.796 --> 02:50:00.717
MATT: No, but it did halt the rest of your turn.

02:50:00.717 --> 02:50:05.277
MARISHA: Yeah, no, it sucked. Empathy: it grows.

02:50:05.277 --> 02:50:08.358
MATT: Yeah, so Jester, what was it? Wisdom saving
throws?

02:50:08.358 --> 02:50:10.338
LAURA: Yes, wisdom saving throws.

02:50:10.338 --> 02:50:11.899
SAM: Against who, both?

02:50:11.899 --> 02:50:13.781
LAURA: Both of them. I'm casting at 2nd-level.

02:50:13.781 --> 02:50:20.312
MATT: The monk rolled a natural 17 plus four, so
it succeeds. The ogre-- no, that's a ten.

02:50:20.312 --> 02:50:24.970
LAURA: Yes! I say: Grovel at my feet, scum!

02:50:25.692 --> 02:50:32.469
MATT: Is it the next turn they do the sentence?
They spend their next action doing this?

02:50:34.969 --> 02:50:39.496
LAURA: Sorry. "The target must succeed or follow
the command on its next turn."

02:50:39.496 --> 02:50:46.851
MATT: Correct. So as you shout that, everyone
laughs and the ogre goes (laughs, groans) and you

02:50:46.851 --> 02:50:52.928
can see this confusion, this wave of "what the
fuck" enter the ogre's face. That's your action?

02:50:52.928 --> 02:50:59.955
LAURA: That's my action. Yeah, that's a spell, so
I can't do my other bonus action. I'm going to

02:50:59.955 --> 02:51:05.054
look over at the drow and be like: (laughs
uncomfortably) Good times, huh?

02:51:05.054 --> 02:51:08.515
MATT: As you look back and laugh and do that, all
you see is the monk going--

02:51:09.662 --> 02:51:11.262
LAURA: Oh no!

02:51:11.262 --> 02:51:13.640
MATT: All right, top of the round. Beau, you're
up.

02:51:13.640 --> 02:51:20.091
MARISHA: Okay, I shake it off really quick, wink
at the guy in front of me, and I turn around and

02:51:20.091 --> 02:51:25.082
I'm going to use my staff to vault off of the
floor, and I'm going to come down for an

02:51:25.082 --> 02:51:28.368
elbow to the ogre's throat.

02:51:28.368 --> 02:51:29.881
MATT: Okay, are you going on this side?

02:51:29.881 --> 02:51:31.762
MARISHA: Yeah, behind him. Coming up from behind.

02:51:31.762 --> 02:51:34.486
MATT: You could pincer with Jester from there.

02:51:34.486 --> 02:51:36.208
MARISHA: Yeah, does that mean I get advantage?

02:51:36.208 --> 02:51:39.639
MATT: You do, yeah. You leap in the air
and come down.

02:51:42.256 --> 02:51:44.270
MARISHA: Wow. 16.

02:51:44.270 --> 02:51:45.686
MATT: 16 hits.

02:51:45.686 --> 02:51:59.065
MARISHA: Okay! So let me make a little note. My
staffy-staff-- six damage. Stunning strike! This

02:51:59.065 --> 02:52:01.524
guy's constitution is probably something stupid.

02:52:01.524 --> 02:52:05.024
MATT: That is 16.

02:52:05.296 --> 02:52:08.014
LAURA: Should have gone for the drow, because
he's going to do stuff on his next turn because

02:52:08.014 --> 02:52:10.264
I told him to.

02:52:10.264 --> 02:52:15.124
MATT: As the staff slams into him, this ogre is
solid muscle. Even though you hit right between

02:52:15.124 --> 02:52:22.268
where you can see a portion of the exposed nerve
clusters would cause a like-size figure to buckle,

02:52:22.268 --> 02:52:26.456
no effect. This is a tough son of a bitch. That's
your first attack.

02:52:26.456 --> 02:52:29.053
MARISHA: I still have movement, yeah?

02:52:29.053 --> 02:52:34.700
MATT: You do. You have (counting) 20 more feet of
movement.

02:52:34.700 --> 02:52:36.427
MARISHA: Can I move around here?

02:52:36.427 --> 02:52:38.053
MATT: Yeah, you can do that.

02:52:38.053 --> 02:52:39.998
MARISHA: Can I get in melee with the girl?

02:52:39.998 --> 02:52:41.758
MATT: Yep.

02:52:41.758 --> 02:52:49.307
MARISHA: Then I have a second attack, so I'm going
to go whack, try and hit her in the face. Do I

02:52:49.307 --> 02:52:51.159
have advantage? Is she flanking?

02:52:51.159 --> 02:52:53.269
MATT: No, you are not directly flanking.

02:52:53.927 --> 02:52:58.304
MARISHA: That's good. 27.

02:52:58.304 --> 02:53:00.136
MATT: That hits! Roll damage.

02:53:00.136 --> 02:53:01.757
MARISHA: No, 25.

02:53:01.757 --> 02:53:03.335
MATT: All righty.

02:53:05.052 --> 02:53:07.186
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay. Nine.

02:53:07.186 --> 02:53:09.221
MATT: Nine points of damage. All right.

02:53:10.031 --> 02:53:11.693
MARISHA: Flurry of Blows.

02:53:11.697 --> 02:53:12.816
MATT: Go for it.

02:53:13.499 --> 02:53:16.298
MARISHA: Fuck. No, wait. Patient Defense.

02:53:16.298 --> 02:53:18.445
TRAVIS: Nice call.

02:53:18.445 --> 02:53:22.236
MATT: You go into a defensive stance. You now
take the dodge action. All right, that finishes your go, Beau.

02:53:22.454 --> 02:53:23.972
MARISHA: That's my "go Beau."

02:53:25.484 --> 02:53:31.692
MATT: It is the drow's turn. The drow gets hit in
the back of the shoulders from Beau, but is

02:53:31.692 --> 02:53:37.459
currently still focused on Jester, seeing suddenly
magic attempting to affect its mind. She knows

02:53:37.459 --> 02:53:41.768
that's a dangerous scenario. Then goes to attempt
to strike towards you.

02:53:43.458 --> 02:53:44.822
MARISHA: Sentinel.

02:53:46.288 --> 02:53:52.600
MATT: Yes, you may. That's a natural one, so she
misses. Goes to swing towards you and, as the fist

02:53:52.600 --> 02:53:55.433
comes towards you, you put the shield up and Beau,
what'd you roll for an attack?

02:53:55.433 --> 02:53:56.561
MARISHA: 19.

02:53:56.561 --> 02:54:01.333
MATT: That hits. Roll damage. Beau actually clocks
her in the base of the skull and you watch as it

02:54:01.333 --> 02:54:05.812
completely prevents her attack coming near. It
actually hurts the knuckles in that hand.

02:54:07.416 --> 02:54:11.837
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah. 11 damage. She can't move.

02:54:13.187 --> 02:54:17.022
MATT: Well, no, because that wasn't a
movement-based one. Movement is still in play.

02:54:17.022 --> 02:54:20.983
Second attack against you. That is a 24 to hit.

02:54:20.983 --> 02:54:22.862
LAURA: Okay.

02:54:24.207 --> 02:54:29.364
MATT: That is eight points of bludgeoning damage.
As the fist comes up and clocks you underneath the

02:54:29.364 --> 02:54:33.841
shield and, using one hand to try and pry the
shield away, uppercuts you right in the lower

02:54:33.841 --> 02:54:36.398
chin. Makes a constitution saving throw for me.

02:54:36.398 --> 02:54:43.562
LAURA: Okay. Oh, it was going to be so good and
then it screwed me!

02:54:43.562 --> 02:54:45.268
SAM: Oh no!

02:54:45.268 --> 02:54:46.192
MATT: What did you roll?

02:54:46.192 --> 02:54:47.985
LAURA: Five!

02:54:48.250 --> 02:54:53.567
MATT: The uppercut causes your head to reel from
the impact and, for a split second, all you see

02:54:53.567 --> 02:54:58.940
are clouds and unicorns the size of hamsters.
It's beautiful.

02:54:58.940 --> 02:55:00.270
LAURA: Oh wow!

02:55:00.270 --> 02:55:02.929
TALIESIN: (bird chirping)

02:55:02.929 --> 02:55:05.539
SAM: (singing "Morning Mood" by Edvard Grieg)

02:55:05.539 --> 02:55:09.860
MATT: Is going to spin around, and is going to go
ahead and, pushing off of Jester's shoulder, jump

02:55:09.860 --> 02:55:13.590
up and do a kick towards the ogre's head, and then
come down with a second kick onto you

02:55:13.590 --> 02:55:14.821
as a bonus action.

02:55:14.821 --> 02:55:16.419
TRAVIS: Oh, hot! Super hot!

02:55:16.419 --> 02:55:17.775
MARISHA: That's dope. That's really cool.

02:55:17.775 --> 02:55:18.793
MATT: (punching)

02:55:18.793 --> 02:55:19.718
TRAVIS: Sploosh.

02:55:19.718 --> 02:55:20.952
LIAM: It's Morphin' Time!

02:55:20.952 --> 02:55:25.442
MATT: Even with a five naturally, still hits the
ogre with all the bonuses intact.

02:55:27.592 --> 02:55:30.011
MARISHA: Disadvantage on Beau.

02:55:30.011 --> 02:55:37.145
MATT: On Beau, yeah. So, the ogre takes an
additional 10 points of bludgeoning damage.

02:55:37.680 --> 02:55:44.597
Then against you, with disadvantage, 17 to hit?
I believe misses you.

02:55:44.597 --> 02:55:45.647
MARISHA: Miss.

02:55:45.647 --> 02:55:50.416
MATT: So, the other kick, (whoosh). You actually
manage to block it with your arm and cause it to

02:55:50.502 --> 02:55:55.057
slide and hit the gravel next to you, causing bits
of stone and rock to spray up in the vicinity.

02:55:55.236 --> 02:56:01.176
MARISHA: Give her a nod in the middle of it.
That's awesome. Respect.

02:56:01.176 --> 02:56:06.210
MATT: There's a moment where she lands and looks
up at you and goes-- not quite sure where this is

02:56:06.210 --> 02:56:12.057
going. That's going to go ahead and finish the
monk's turn. That brings us to the ogre's go. The

02:56:12.057 --> 02:56:19.308
ogre, who just got kicked in the face, goes
(grunts in frustration). Slams a knee onto the

02:56:19.308 --> 02:56:21.768
ground, crosses the blades in front.

02:56:21.768 --> 02:56:23.831
LAURA: It says that it falls prone if he's
groveling.

02:56:23.831 --> 02:56:25.696
MARISHA: Yes! Yas queen!

02:56:25.696 --> 02:56:28.621
MATT: Yes. (growls in anger) I'll put him this
way, because he's groveling.

02:56:28.621 --> 02:56:30.508
TRAVIS: (imitates ogre)

02:56:30.508 --> 02:56:32.647
MATT: (grunts in anger)

02:56:32.647 --> 02:56:33.686
LAURA: Yeah!

02:56:33.686 --> 02:56:34.687
MATT: It spends its action doing that, right?

02:56:34.687 --> 02:56:35.705
LAURA: Oh, yeah.

02:56:35.705 --> 02:56:39.886
MATT: Then goes, (growls in anger), and uses half
of its movement to get up from prone.

02:56:39.886 --> 02:56:42.191
SAM: Okay.

02:56:42.191 --> 02:56:45.985
LAURA: Wait, what? He can do that that fast? That
seems lame.

02:56:46.020 --> 02:56:48.925
MATT: Yeah. But, you spent his action; he can't do
anything.

02:56:48.925 --> 02:56:50.056
LAURA: That's true, yeah.

02:56:50.056 --> 02:56:51.557
MATT: It's a level one spell. It's fine.

02:56:51.557 --> 02:56:53.140
TRAVIS: He didn't kill himself.

02:56:53.140 --> 02:56:54.415
MATT: That's true.

02:56:54.415 --> 02:56:56.374
(laughter)

02:56:57.574 --> 02:57:00.693
LAURA: Oh, no, "the target falls prone and then
ends its turn."

02:57:00.791 --> 02:57:06.527
MATT: Okay, thanks for clarification. So, yeah.
(grunts in anger) On the ground, face in the gravel,

02:57:06.527 --> 02:57:08.205
(growls in anger) angrily.

02:57:08.228 --> 02:57:10.063
(laughter)

02:57:10.063 --> 02:57:12.857
MATT: Bits of stone get lodged in the back of the
mouth. That finishes the ogre's turn. It's your

02:57:12.857 --> 02:57:13.987
turn, Jester.

02:57:14.209 --> 02:57:15.500
LAURA: I'm stunned.

02:57:15.500 --> 02:57:19.323
MATT: You're stunned, so you're just (bird
tweets).

02:57:19.323 --> 02:57:20.937
LAURA: It's so pretty!

02:57:20.937 --> 02:57:23.703
MATT: (singing in high tone) "Ha, ha! We love you,
Jester! We love you, Jester!" And dancing around

02:57:23.703 --> 02:57:27.909
you. The colors are beautiful. You hear harp
music; it's amazing.

02:57:28.218 --> 02:57:29.715
TRAVIS: Tiefling penis.

02:57:29.715 --> 02:57:31.269
(laughter)

02:57:31.508 --> 02:57:33.374
MATT: That brings us to the top. Beau, you're up.

02:57:33.374 --> 02:57:34.767
MARISHA: Go on for the monk.

02:57:34.767 --> 02:57:36.197
MATT: All right.

02:57:36.197 --> 02:57:42.305
MARISHA: Just me and her. So, after I give her the
nod, I'm going to go and try a knee to the kidney!

02:57:42.305 --> 02:57:44.088
MATT: Go for it.

02:57:44.088 --> 02:57:46.873
TALIESIN: She moved. Is she now in between the two
of them?

02:57:46.873 --> 02:57:48.974
LAURA: Oh, yeah. You can move.

02:57:48.974 --> 02:57:51.780
MARISHA: Can I flank with Jester, if I go to the
other side? Can I move around?

02:57:51.780 --> 02:57:53.023
MATT: If you shift here?

02:57:53.023 --> 02:57:54.365
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:57:54.365 --> 02:57:56.008
MATT: Technically, no, because you're not
threatening; you are stunned.

02:57:56.008 --> 02:57:57.386
TALIESIN: Oh, nevermind.

02:57:57.386 --> 02:58:00.023
MARISHA: Okay. First attack, 16?

02:58:00.023 --> 02:58:05.571
MATT: Sixteen misses. You go to swing and the
monk, ready for this maneuver, actually grabs your

02:58:05.571 --> 02:58:09.366
wrist, pulls you in, and uses a reaction to bop
you right in the face.

02:58:09.366 --> 02:58:12.097
MARISHA: Do I still have patient defense?

02:58:12.097 --> 02:58:14.404
MATT: No. That is going to be a 25 to hit.

02:58:14.404 --> 02:58:15.522
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:58:15.522 --> 02:58:16.932
TRAVIS: Damn.

02:58:16.932 --> 02:58:19.283
MATT: That is going to be 12 points of bludgeoning
damage.

02:58:19.283 --> 02:58:22.449
MARISHA: Jesus Christ.

02:58:22.449 --> 02:58:25.946
MATT: Is going to go ahead and make another
Constitution saving throw.

02:58:25.946 --> 02:58:27.472
LIAM: Shit.

02:58:27.472 --> 02:58:33.074
MARISHA: Okay. That's totally wrong. Um, 14?

02:58:33.074 --> 02:58:37.619
MATT: Fourteen? No, you're stunned.

02:58:37.619 --> 02:58:39.532
MARISHA: Fuck!

02:58:39.532 --> 02:58:44.283
LAURA: Her save is higher than yours!

02:58:44.283 --> 02:58:49.909
MATT: So, with the wrist pulled forward and
(crack), right in the jaw, ugh! Your vision

02:58:49.909 --> 02:58:54.699
tunnels to darkness, and all you can see is gravel
before you. And, in your head, you're like, "I'm

02:58:54.699 --> 02:58:59.368
punching away!" But all you see is Beau going
(stammers) in this own little world fighting

02:58:59.368 --> 02:59:04.121
nothing. The monk just watching that happen,
because it closes the rest of your turn.

02:59:04.121 --> 02:59:05.730
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:59:05.730 --> 02:59:11.739
MATT: That finishes your go. It is now the monk's
turn. You're no longer stunned, but she still

02:59:11.739 --> 02:59:13.624
managed to shut down your turn.

02:59:13.624 --> 02:59:15.317
TALIESIN: Is Jester not stunned?

02:59:15.317 --> 02:59:17.583
LAURA: I'm not stunned because that was the end of
her turn.

02:59:17.583 --> 02:59:18.651
MATT: Correct.

02:59:18.651 --> 02:59:19.545
LAURA: Okay.

02:59:19.545 --> 02:59:20.656
TALIESIN: Yay reactions.

02:59:20.656 --> 02:59:21.632
LAURA: Yay.

02:59:21.632 --> 02:59:22.804
MATT: There you go.

02:59:23.494 --> 02:59:25.158
TALIESIN: Oh, man.

02:59:25.696 --> 02:59:26.860
LAURA: Okay.

02:59:26.860 --> 02:59:39.111
MATT: The monk, looking at the scenario, is going
to go ahead and spend a ki point to take the, as a

02:59:39.111 --> 02:59:47.759
bonus action, the disengage maneuver. Then
actually vault over the ogre that's on the ground.

02:59:47.759 --> 02:59:56.023
Flipping in the air, grabs onto one of the ceiling
boards and swings over, lands down on the opposite

02:59:56.023 --> 02:59:57.331
side of the ogre.

02:59:57.331 --> 02:59:59.301
MARISHA: Fuck, she's so cool!

02:59:59.301 --> 03:00:04.094
MATT: Right there and is going to, coming down,
slam with advantage on two strikes

03:00:04.094 --> 03:00:09.304
against the ogre. That is--

03:00:12.024 --> 03:00:13.339
TALIESIN: Advantage, right?

03:00:13.339 --> 03:00:24.184
MATT: Yeah, with advantage on it. Yeah, that hits.
Seven points of damage. Second strike, that hits!

03:00:24.184 --> 03:00:32.812
Seven points of damage, and is just going to do
one additional attack. That misses! Okay, actually

03:00:32.812 --> 03:00:39.052
even with advantage, it was three and a four. The
ogre is in the process of getting back up off the

03:00:39.052 --> 03:00:44.688
ground, and rolls out just as the final attack
comes down and blasts into the nearby gravel and

03:00:44.840 --> 03:00:48.270
stone, pulls its fist back and you see there's
stones kind of pressed into the skin with a little

03:00:48.270 --> 03:00:58.615
of blood starting to pour down. The ogre angrily
gets up for its turn. It's going to take two

03:00:58.615 --> 03:01:03.647
strikes at you, Jester. Then action surge and take
two strikes on the monk.

03:01:03.647 --> 03:01:06.533
LAURA: Me? Little old me? But why?

03:01:07.927 --> 03:01:10.689
MATT: First attack against you, that's
a 22 to hit.

03:01:10.689 --> 03:01:12.597
LAURA: I guess that hits.

03:01:12.597 --> 03:01:18.987
MATT: (laughs) You take nine points of slashing
damage from the shortsword striking right across

03:01:18.987 --> 03:01:23.363
your shield. Pushes it into you, and the blade
just catches you across the forehead and gashes

03:01:23.363 --> 03:01:26.985
you from one eyebrow up to the edge of your
hairline.

03:01:26.985 --> 03:01:29.822
LAURA: I think I've got bangs now, you guys.

03:01:29.822 --> 03:01:32.408
(laughter)

03:01:32.408 --> 03:01:33.556
MATT: 25 to hit?

03:01:33.556 --> 03:01:35.035
LAURA: Yeah.

03:01:36.489 --> 03:01:41.386
MATT: That's going to be 16 points of slashing
damage. As you pull back, looking at the blood in

03:01:41.386 --> 03:01:45.432
your hand from the recoiling, you look up in time
just as the other shortsword pierces underneath

03:01:45.432 --> 03:01:49.220
the shield and catches you in the abdomen. You
push away with the shield, preventing it from

03:01:49.220 --> 03:01:53.263
going as deep as it could've gone, but that's like
two inches of blade that just caught you right

03:01:53.263 --> 03:01:55.596
between where the leather armor protects you.

03:01:55.596 --> 03:01:57.640
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

03:01:57.840 --> 03:02:08.683
MATT: Action surge, spins around toward the other
monk. That is a hit and a miss. So the monk takes

03:02:08.814 --> 03:02:19.088
12 points of damage there, and he misses with the
other strike. That finishes the ogre's go.

03:02:19.088 --> 03:02:20.400
Jester, you're up.

03:02:20.400 --> 03:02:32.842
LAURA: That's me! Okay. I'm going to-- oh, geez;
this all sucks! I'm going to cast (distressed

03:02:32.842 --> 03:02:47.945
moan) Spirit Guardians on myself. I'm going to
say, oh, my sturdy hamster unicorns need to

03:02:47.945 --> 03:02:51.879
protect me now. I'm going to cast Spirit Guardians
at--

03:02:52.536 --> 03:02:59.924
MATT: Okay, does Spirit Guardians say creatures
that you choose?

03:03:00.961 --> 03:03:06.423
LAURA: Well, it says if you're evil, they appear
fiendish, if you're--

03:03:06.423 --> 03:03:09.883
MATT: Right, but who's affected by it, is what I'm
asking.

03:03:09.883 --> 03:03:11.780
LAURA: What do you mean?

03:03:11.780 --> 03:03:15.538
MATT: Meaning you are in a room that is dense with
a lot of people not involved in this fight.

03:03:15.538 --> 03:03:20.540
If this spell doesn't have a way of differentiating
between who you choose to be affected and not, you're

03:03:20.717 --> 03:03:25.625
about to hit a <i>lot</i> of creatures in this
tavern, so just double checking on this.

03:03:25.625 --> 03:03:30.375
LAURA: Oh, no, no. Yeah, yeah. "Protect you. They
float around you... When you cast this spell,

03:03:30.375 --> 03:03:32.235
you can designate--"

03:03:32.235 --> 03:03:34.504
MATT: "Designate any number of creatures you can
see," okay! There you go. So who do you define to

03:03:34.511 --> 03:03:36.775
be unaffected by it?

03:03:36.775 --> 03:03:40.039
LAURA: Everybody but the ogre and the drow.

03:03:40.039 --> 03:03:45.544
MATT: Got it. So, as you kind of come to again,
and focus, you say a little prayer and everyone

03:03:45.544 --> 03:03:51.792
watches as all these tiny little bubbles pop in
the air around you, and emerging from it are these

03:03:51.792 --> 03:03:57.632
tiny, cute little hamster-sized unicorns that
float (tiny neighing) dancing through the air.

03:03:57.632 --> 03:04:02.112
All right; that's your action. Do you want to move?

03:04:02.112 --> 03:04:08.621
LAURA: I'm scared he's going to hit me if I do it.
Do I have Healing Word? Let me check.

03:04:09.720 --> 03:04:13.577
MATT: You couldn't cast Healing Word this turn anyway
because you already used the regular spell.

03:04:13.689 --> 03:04:17.252
LAURA: Right, yes. Okay then, yeah, I guess I'm
good right here, then.

03:04:17.252 --> 03:04:20.650
MATT: All right, are you going to stay right there?
You got it. Okay, that finishes Jester's go.

03:04:20.650 --> 03:04:22.281
LAURA: Jester in the corner.

03:04:22.281 --> 03:04:27.763
LIAM: At that moment, Frumpkin, seemingly
terrified by the unicorns flying in the air, runs

03:04:27.763 --> 03:04:33.241
screeching out towards the drow and starts dancing
around her legs running circles under her feet and

03:04:33.241 --> 03:04:35.250
using the help action.

03:04:35.250 --> 03:04:36.628
MATT: For who?

03:04:36.628 --> 03:04:38.200
LIAM: To the drow.

03:04:38.200 --> 03:04:39.636
MATT: You are going to help the drow?

03:04:39.636 --> 03:04:44.541
LIAM: No, not help, distract. What is it? "You can
aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature

03:04:44.541 --> 03:04:47.157
within five feet of you." The cat.

03:04:47.157 --> 03:04:51.325
MATT: Okay, so the next attack is going to be with
advantage, got it. All right. Beau, your turn.

03:04:51.325 --> 03:04:54.292
LIAM: So it's dancing around the drow's feet.
(feline yowling)

03:04:54.292 --> 03:04:55.802
MARISHA: Do I see the cat?

03:04:55.956 --> 03:05:01.126
MATT: Yeah. The drow is still focused, but looks
down at the cat and is like, "Shit!" and is

03:05:01.126 --> 03:05:02.488
trying to kick it off.

03:05:02.488 --> 03:05:05.734
MARISHA: I get down on a knee and I jam the end of
my staff right into her ribs.

03:05:05.734 --> 03:05:07.044
MATT: So you move over to engage?

03:05:07.044 --> 03:05:09.497
MARISHA: Yeah, I come over. I kind of slide and
then jam.

03:05:09.497 --> 03:05:11.606
MATT: Make the attack with advantage.

03:05:13.085 --> 03:05:16.165
MARISHA: Yeah, okay, okay. 21.

03:05:16.165 --> 03:05:17.568
MATT: 21 hits.

03:05:17.568 --> 03:05:18.764
MARISHA: Wait-- yes, 21.

03:05:18.764 --> 03:05:19.957
MATT: 21 hits.

03:05:21.177 --> 03:05:22.373
MARISHA: Nine.

03:05:22.488 --> 03:05:24.249
MATT: Nine points of damage.

03:05:24.385 --> 03:05:25.683
TRAVIS: Nein!

03:05:25.683 --> 03:05:27.055
MATT: Crack!

03:05:29.905 --> 03:05:31.516
MARISHA: Stunning Strike.

03:05:32.095 --> 03:05:33.128
MATT: Okay.

03:05:33.750 --> 03:05:36.125
MARISHA: Fuck, I hope this works.

03:05:36.565 --> 03:05:38.827
MATT: Natural 13 plus two, 15.

03:05:38.827 --> 03:05:41.006
MARISHA: Plus two, plus two.

03:05:41.006 --> 03:05:43.053
LAURA: Bane, she needs Bane!

03:05:43.053 --> 03:05:44.849
LIAM: 15's the number?

03:05:44.849 --> 03:05:47.414
MARISHA: No, 14's the number.

03:05:47.414 --> 03:05:55.265
MATT: 14's the DC. So the impact of the staff hits
her in the stomach, and impacts in the belly, and

03:05:55.265 --> 03:06:00.466
the eyes immediately shift to you, angrily,
piercing red anger out of the drow's eyes.

03:06:00.466 --> 03:06:02.506
That's your first attack?

03:06:02.506 --> 03:06:04.072
MARISHA: Bitch!

03:06:04.072 --> 03:06:05.211
MATT: You have your second attack.

03:06:05.211 --> 03:06:11.145
MARISHA: Second attack! I try and bring up the
staff from my kneeling position and come up for

03:06:11.145 --> 03:06:12.895
under her jaw.

03:06:12.895 --> 03:06:14.261
MATT: Go for it.

03:06:15.156 --> 03:06:17.341
LIAM: Oh my god! That's crazy, just roll another
one.

03:06:19.511 --> 03:06:26.684
MARISHA: I hate everything. No. Just no. 11.

03:06:26.833 --> 03:06:33.660
MATT: 11, no. As you, after slamming the staff in
the stomach, swing upwards, and she catches it,

03:06:33.660 --> 03:06:38.000
and with the momentum pulls you in, and then is
going to kick you in the face as you're moving

03:06:38.000 --> 03:06:39.300
forward. Pop!

03:06:41.422 --> 03:06:43.255
That is going to be a 22 to hit.

03:06:43.255 --> 03:06:44.439
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:06:47.114 --> 03:06:53.203
MATT: All right, that is going to be seven points
of bludgeoning damage as her foot cracks you in

03:06:53.203 --> 03:06:59.678
the jaw. Your neck almost snaps. Not breaks, but
almost whiplashes you from the impact. Is not going

03:06:59.678 --> 03:07:04.486
to attempt to stun you with that. You still have
the rest of your turn. You have your bonus action.

03:07:04.486 --> 03:07:06.033
MARISHA: Patient Defense.

03:07:06.033 --> 03:07:08.042
MATT: Okay, Patient Defense. You're under
a dodge marker.

03:07:08.042 --> 03:07:09.778
SAM: Ever so slowly--

03:07:10.093 --> 03:07:12.181
TRAVIS: Don't fuck it up!

03:07:12.181 --> 03:07:13.473
SAM: Can the Mage Hand--

03:07:13.473 --> 03:07:14.731
TRAVIS: What are you doing?

03:07:14.731 --> 03:07:17.619
SAM: --be just slightly dragging the diamond?

03:07:17.619 --> 03:07:20.186
(laughter)

03:07:20.812 --> 03:07:23.082
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check.

03:07:23.082 --> 03:07:24.193
MARISHA: Yes!

03:07:24.193 --> 03:07:25.551
SAM: Just really close.

03:07:25.551 --> 03:07:27.131
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check.

03:07:27.131 --> 03:07:30.972
SAM: Okay. 27.

03:07:31.652 --> 03:07:35.271
MATT: Like the mystery of the stones moving during
a desert rain--

03:07:35.401 --> 03:07:37.388
SAM: I try to time it to every footfall.

03:07:37.388 --> 03:07:41.252
MATT: The diamond begins to slowly carve this path
through the gravel, but people are too focused on

03:07:41.252 --> 03:07:46.696
the fight going on on the opposite side of the
chamber that, for the time being, it's slowly

03:07:46.696 --> 03:07:48.889
moving without being noticed.

03:07:48.889 --> 03:07:50.653
LIAM: It's like a dollar on a string.

03:07:50.653 --> 03:07:51.923
MATT: Yep.

03:07:51.923 --> 03:07:55.924
TALIESIN: I definitely did not see that, okay.
I was hoping.

03:07:55.924 --> 03:08:00.660
MATT: Perfect. That brings us to the monk's turn;
it's the end of Beau's go. The monk, angrily, is

03:08:00.660 --> 03:08:06.053
going to unload on you at first, Beau. With
disadvantage, because you took the dodge action.

03:08:07.574 --> 03:08:10.813
That's going to be 20 to hit, what's your
armor class?

03:08:10.813 --> 03:08:12.212
MARISHA: 20!

03:08:12.212 --> 03:08:14.222
MATT: 20 hits.

03:08:14.222 --> 03:08:17.802
SAM: Ducey! Do something!

03:08:18.073 --> 03:08:22.963
MATT: That is 11 points of bludgeoning damage. One
fist, crack! Coming up with the second blow.

03:08:26.333 --> 03:08:29.293
Natural 20, and 19.

03:08:29.293 --> 03:08:30.882
TRAVIS: Fucking--

03:08:30.882 --> 03:08:34.193
MATT: Well, no. Dodge action, so it was
disadvantage, so the natural 20 does nothing.

03:08:34.193 --> 03:08:36.132
TRAVIS: I know, but the natural 19...

03:08:36.132 --> 03:08:38.437
MARISHA: But a 19 definitely hits.

03:08:38.437 --> 03:08:40.014
MATT: I thought your armor class was 20.

03:08:40.014 --> 03:08:44.072
MARISHA: Oh! Oh, I thought you were saying you
rolled a 19 and a 20, so no, miss.

03:08:44.072 --> 03:08:46.114
MATT: No, sorry, no. It was a 19 total.

03:08:46.114 --> 03:08:48.406
MARISHA: Sorry, I thought you were saying
natural 19.

03:08:48.406 --> 03:08:58.390
MATT: No, it was a natural nine. Sorry, a natural
10. So it misses you. The second swing just whiffs

03:08:58.390 --> 03:09:03.193
as you dodge out of the way, prepared for it.
Bonus action, Flurry of Blows.

03:09:03.444 --> 03:09:07.802
LIAM and TRAVIS: (singing Ballroom Blitz)

03:09:08.160 --> 03:09:12.764
MATT: 15, misses. You're now IP Man, just slapping
the blows away.

03:09:12.764 --> 03:09:15.891
MARISHA: Dial in, I can see the Matrix!

03:09:17.138 --> 03:09:19.013
MATT: Disadvantage, that brings it to a 13.

03:09:19.013 --> 03:09:19.964
MARISHA: Miss.

03:09:19.964 --> 03:09:25.396
MATT: So that first crack hits you and then, all
of a sudden, you go into focus mode. Deflecting,

03:09:25.396 --> 03:09:29.763
and with each strike you parry off to the side,
not even making eye contact, just looking straight

03:09:29.763 --> 03:09:31.743
ahead, remembering all your training.

03:09:31.743 --> 03:09:33.573
MARISHA: Well, I'm still a little dazed, so I'm
just...

03:09:33.573 --> 03:09:37.992
LAURA: Wait, did she start within 15 feet of me?
Did she start her turn?

03:09:37.992 --> 03:09:39.302
MATT: She would have, yeah.

03:09:39.302 --> 03:09:40.883
LAURA: So she's got to make a wisdom saving
throw.

03:09:40.883 --> 03:09:43.742
MATT: Wisdom save. That is a nine.

03:09:43.742 --> 03:09:45.113
LAURA: Yeah!

03:09:45.113 --> 03:09:46.263
SAM: Whoa, what does that do?

03:09:46.263 --> 03:09:47.614
LAURA: That's 3d8 damage!

03:09:47.614 --> 03:09:49.233
TRAVIS: Yeah!

03:09:49.686 --> 03:09:51.453
LAURA: Woo!

03:09:51.453 --> 03:09:52.724
Oh, 16. 17.

03:09:53.427 --> 03:09:54.884
SAM: Oh, that wasn't a seven?

03:09:54.884 --> 03:09:57.002
LAURA: No, it looked like a seven, but
it was a one.

03:09:57.002 --> 03:09:58.883
TALIESIN: Speed is halved, also.

03:09:58.883 --> 03:10:06.972
MATT: Yes. As this series of blows that Beau is
deflecting with each strike, these tiny unicorns

03:10:06.972 --> 03:10:12.405
are jabbing in and piercing the side of the neck.
She's trying to bat them away, but she's currently

03:10:12.405 --> 03:10:15.442
being ransacked by, to her, a nightmare.

03:10:15.688 --> 03:10:17.663
TALIESIN: It is radiant damage, also,
I don't know if that--

03:10:17.663 --> 03:10:19.292
LAURA: It is radiant damage.

03:10:19.292 --> 03:10:20.702
MATT: No additional hurt.

03:10:20.702 --> 03:10:22.583
LAURA: If anybody starts--

03:10:22.583 --> 03:10:24.133
TALIESIN: Within 15 feet.

03:10:24.133 --> 03:10:27.696
MATT: Ogre's turn. Ogre starts the turn, natural one
on the save. Go ahead and roll damage for the ogre.

03:10:29.166 --> 03:10:31.941
LAURA: That's cocked. 13 points.

03:10:32.405 --> 03:10:42.238
MATT: 13 points. The ogre begins spitting at them.
No effect, and turns around towards you, as both

03:10:42.238 --> 03:10:47.460
of them are locked in, as the source of the
unicorns, and (roar) does a double strike to try

03:10:47.460 --> 03:10:55.444
and carve through your torso with both blades.
That is a natural 17. Yeah, a 25 to hit.

03:10:55.444 --> 03:10:57.343
LAURA: Okay.

03:10:58.697 --> 03:11:00.874
MATT: That's going to be nine points
of slashing damage.

03:11:00.874 --> 03:11:01.946
LAURA: Okay.

03:11:02.796 --> 03:11:05.893
MATT: The next one's going to be 20 to hit. What's
your armor class?

03:11:05.893 --> 03:11:07.214
LAURA: 18.

03:11:07.214 --> 03:11:14.843
MATT: 18, hits you. Ooh, double sixes. That's
going to be 17 points of slashing damage.

03:11:15.893 --> 03:11:17.054
LAURA: I'm unconscious.

03:11:17.143 --> 03:11:19.257
ALL: Oh!

03:11:20.516 --> 03:11:28.997
MATT: The unicorns fade as Jester plummets back,
the shield that she brought up in time to protect

03:11:28.997 --> 03:11:33.975
a blow from vitally cutting through her torso.
However, it still manages to cleave into the

03:11:33.975 --> 03:11:36.138
shoulder, and she falls to the ground. You are--

03:11:36.138 --> 03:11:38.708
TALIESIN: Spare the Dying, before she even hits
the ground.

03:11:38.708 --> 03:11:42.946
MATT: Okay, so you're no longer bleeding. You are
stabilized, but you are unconscious.

03:11:42.946 --> 03:11:44.610
LAURA: Yeah, okay.

03:11:44.610 --> 03:11:49.996
MATT: All righty. That ends the ogre's two strikes
there. Beau.

03:11:49.996 --> 03:11:53.611
LIAM: Would that have been Jester's turn, had she
not gone down?

03:11:53.611 --> 03:11:55.247
MATT: It would have been, yes.

03:11:55.247 --> 03:11:57.657
LIAM: Then the cat continues to jig and dance,
unless she does something about it.

03:11:57.657 --> 03:11:59.659
MATT: Okay. Beau, you're up.

03:11:59.659 --> 03:12:01.556
MARISHA: Does that mean I get another advantage?

03:12:01.556 --> 03:12:04.057
MATT: On your first strike, against the drow.

03:12:06.227 --> 03:12:15.257
MARISHA: Okay, all right. Try and use that dialled
in focus. That one's cocked, everyone witnessed

03:12:15.392 --> 03:12:22.000
that. 18 plus four-- sorry, four plus 18. 22?

03:12:22.000 --> 03:12:23.264
MATT: 22 hits.

03:12:23.264 --> 03:12:25.540
MARISHA: Four plus eight? (babbling) Words?

03:12:25.540 --> 03:12:28.504
MATT: Yeah. Good thing you did that, because the
other roll was a natural one.

03:12:30.054 --> 03:12:31.684
LIAM: (cat screech)

03:12:32.306 --> 03:12:33.847
MARISHA: Ten damage.

03:12:36.277 --> 03:12:38.326
MATT: She's looking rough. All right.

03:12:38.326 --> 03:12:40.725
LAURA and MARISHA: She's looking rough?

03:12:41.615 --> 03:12:43.626
LAURA: Yeah, but the ogre is still like...

03:12:44.485 --> 03:12:48.033
MATT: The ogre's still up. Ogre's hurt, but
hanging in.

03:12:48.033 --> 03:12:50.193
LIAM: One target at a tim-- (pigeon cooing)

03:12:50.193 --> 03:12:53.892
MARISHA: Second attack at her. 19,
which I think hits.

03:12:53.892 --> 03:12:55.335
MATT: Yeah.

03:12:56.703 --> 03:12:58.604
MARISHA: Nine.

03:12:58.774 --> 03:13:03.901
MATT: Nine points of damage, all righty. So whack,
crack with the staff. Each time the drow's knocked

03:13:03.901 --> 03:13:10.933
to each side. You can see blood (splatter) across
the gravel pit around her. Comes back up, one eye

03:13:10.933 --> 03:13:18.422
is a little bit half-closed, that focus coming in,
not giving in to the urge to slip into the

03:13:18.422 --> 03:13:20.493
darkness. She's just focused on you.

03:13:20.493 --> 03:13:21.653
MARISHA: Flurry of Blows.

03:13:21.653 --> 03:13:22.973
MATT: Go for it.

03:13:25.043 --> 03:13:30.687
MARISHA: That's a natural 18-- no, it's a 15, but
that still hits. 23.

03:13:30.687 --> 03:13:32.283
MATT: Yeah, that hits. Roll damage.

03:13:32.283 --> 03:13:34.034
LIAM: Sweep the leg!

03:13:34.313 --> 03:13:39.894
MARISHA: That's better than-- I just realized
I've been rolling damage dice smaller

03:13:39.894 --> 03:13:41.793
than I should have been.

03:13:41.793 --> 03:13:43.673
MATT: Well, there you go.

03:13:43.673 --> 03:13:45.754
MARISHA: I should have been rolling d8s
for the staffs.

03:13:45.754 --> 03:13:47.203
LIAM: They're much more epic now.

03:13:47.203 --> 03:13:50.360
MARISHA: Ten damage. Fuck. That pisses me off.

03:13:50.734 --> 03:13:52.833
TRAVIS: It happens. It happens.

03:13:52.833 --> 03:13:53.833
MARISHA: Yep.

03:13:58.163 --> 03:14:00.372
MARISHA: 17, misses.

03:14:00.380 --> 03:14:11.088
MATT: 17 misses. Reaction: after that series of
attacks, breathing heavy, on a thread of

03:14:11.088 --> 03:14:18.418
consciousness. In that moment, that final blow,
the eyes go (spark) the shine, the anime spark in

03:14:18.418 --> 03:14:23.709
the eyes, as you go for that final strike, grabs
and then (wham) right to your abdomen.

03:14:25.393 --> 03:14:26.604
Natural 19.

03:14:26.604 --> 03:14:27.934
SAM: Oh no.

03:14:28.173 --> 03:14:31.304
MATT: That is 9 points of bludgeoning damage.

03:14:32.373 --> 03:14:34.533
LAURA: She's rolling the right dice.

03:14:35.050 --> 03:14:37.629
MARISHA: She's totally rolling the right
fucking dice.

03:14:37.629 --> 03:14:39.220
LIAM: Our girl's on the ropes, guys.

03:14:39.220 --> 03:14:40.909
LAURA: Oh, she would be dead, yo!

03:14:40.909 --> 03:14:42.930
TRAVIS: (heartbeat)

03:14:42.930 --> 03:14:46.109
MARISHA: I'm going to move around behind her
and--

03:14:47.150 --> 03:14:49.509
LIAM: Flank-flank-flank.

03:14:49.509 --> 03:14:53.930
MARISHA: She's next, right? She just used her
reaction to hit me?

03:14:54.035 --> 03:14:55.151
TRAVIS: (heartbeat)

03:14:55.151 --> 03:14:56.360
MATT: Correct.

03:14:56.360 --> 03:15:00.080
MARISHA: I'm going to bounce. I'm going to get
right to the corner. I'm going to let her deal

03:15:00.080 --> 03:15:01.109
with the ogre.

03:15:01.109 --> 03:15:02.570
MATT: Okay. This far?

03:15:02.570 --> 03:15:04.401
MARISHA: Further, if I can. Yeah.

03:15:04.401 --> 03:15:05.570
MATT: Okay.

03:15:05.570 --> 03:15:08.450
MARISHA: I'm going to catch my breath in the
corner, try not to puke.

03:15:08.607 --> 03:15:14.656
MATT: All right. Her turn. She sees you rush away,
sees her scenario and how rough it's going,

03:15:14.656 --> 03:15:20.297
looking at both sides. (heavy sigh) She's going to
make two attacks on this ogre.

03:15:20.837 --> 03:15:22.226
TRAVIS: Yeah!

03:15:22.226 --> 03:15:24.106
TALIESIN: Bring them both down.

03:15:24.546 --> 03:15:25.751
MATT: Natural 20.

03:15:25.751 --> 03:15:26.906
TALIESIN: Nice.

03:15:26.906 --> 03:15:28.856
MATT: Be glad you moved away.

03:15:29.048 --> 03:15:31.037
MARISHA: Yeah, don't want that for me.

03:15:31.037 --> 03:15:35.255
MATT: That's going to be 14 points of damage to
the ogre.

03:15:38.325 --> 03:15:40.366
Next attack, natural 18.

03:15:40.366 --> 03:15:41.926
TRAVIS: Wow.

03:15:44.956 --> 03:15:50.227
MATT: After doing this, glancing at both of you,
reaches forward. The ogre has both blades out and

03:15:50.227 --> 03:15:54.550
is chuckling now, licking the blood from under its
lip where you can see it's split from one of the

03:15:54.550 --> 03:15:59.476
previous attacks in the battle, for a fourth time
now. This jaw is just wrecked. Getting both blades

03:15:59.476 --> 03:16:06.395
at the side and is leaning forward, and the drow,
still looking at you, just goes (impact), hits him

03:16:06.395 --> 03:16:08.445
right square in the junk.

03:16:08.445 --> 03:16:09.711
ALL: Yeah!

03:16:09.711 --> 03:16:14.338
MATT: Right as the ogre (groan) leans forward
angrily, grabs him over the head, and just brings

03:16:14.338 --> 03:16:16.801
his jaw down onto her shoulder.

03:16:16.844 --> 03:16:18.444
TRAVIS: Yeah! Tombstone!

03:16:18.480 --> 03:16:23.611
MATT: Tombstones him, and you watch the ogre, both
blades (metallic clattering) onto the stonework,

03:16:23.611 --> 03:16:30.901
and then shrugs him off, and he rolls onto the
ground, unconscious, to her side. At which point,

03:16:30.901 --> 03:16:36.762
she uses a ki point, Patient Defense,
as a bonus action.

03:16:36.762 --> 03:16:39.712
TRAVIS: Making it interesting!

03:16:39.712 --> 03:16:46.720
MATT: And then runs along the side, parkours
off the side of the tavern, and lands

03:16:46.720 --> 03:16:48.221
right in front of you.

03:16:48.221 --> 03:16:49.597
TRAVIS: Maybe just make out with her.

03:16:49.597 --> 03:16:50.681
MARISHA: Yeah!

03:16:50.681 --> 03:16:52.183
MATT: It's your turn.

03:16:52.183 --> 03:16:53.270
LIAM: Disarming.

03:16:53.270 --> 03:16:54.451
MATT: Persuasion check? Nah.

03:16:54.599 --> 03:16:56.466
TALIESIN: Disarming tongue.

03:16:58.106 --> 03:16:59.947
MARISHA: Disarming tongue!

03:17:00.194 --> 03:17:02.425
LIAM: Now or later!

03:17:03.778 --> 03:17:07.124
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Spare the Dying
on the ogre.

03:17:07.124 --> 03:17:11.725
MARISHA: That'd be so fucking cheap, right? That'd
be terrible. I shouldn't do that.

03:17:11.725 --> 03:17:13.425
MATT: What are you doing?

03:17:13.425 --> 03:17:17.815
LIAM: I send Frumpkin running out that window,
past the ogre. She's on her own. (meow)

03:17:17.815 --> 03:17:21.295
SAM: Diamond still making slow progress.

03:17:21.564 --> 03:17:24.394
MATT: Roll another sleight of hand check for me.

03:17:24.394 --> 03:17:28.246
SAM: Okay. Not as good. 17.

03:17:28.246 --> 03:17:34.355
MATT: Okay. It continues to move, and everyone
else is invested in this fight, and one of the

03:17:34.355 --> 03:17:37.164
goblins to your right goes, "Huh?"

03:17:37.164 --> 03:17:39.674
SAM: Oh no. Okay, good to know.

03:17:39.674 --> 03:17:41.704
MATT: That's where it stands. Beau, what're you
doing?

03:17:41.704 --> 03:17:44.535
MARISHA: I don't have any type of advantage or
anything, right? Oh my god.

03:17:44.535 --> 03:17:49.375
TRAVIS: Leave it to the dice, man. Leave it to the
dice! Come on!

03:17:49.375 --> 03:17:52.904
LIAM: Take a chance. Roll the dice.

03:17:52.904 --> 03:17:54.497
MARISHA: I exhale.

03:17:54.497 --> 03:17:56.294
LAURA: (singing) Roll the dice!

03:17:56.294 --> 03:18:03.604
MARISHA: I look for an opening in her defense. I'm
dialing into her pupils and I'm looking for every

03:18:03.604 --> 03:18:09.816
little twitch of her finger or twitch of her head,
and pop, pop! I'm going to go for it.

03:18:09.816 --> 03:18:11.384
MATT: With disadvantage.

03:18:11.384 --> 03:18:18.125
MARISHA: Fucking fuck, disadvantage. Argh!
That was a natural 20! But, 16?

03:18:18.287 --> 03:18:26.347
MATT: 16 misses. It goes by, reaction. She
immediately knocks it out of the side and goes

03:18:26.347 --> 03:18:29.378
for a knuckle punch right to the center of
your face.

03:18:30.732 --> 03:18:32.220
That's a natural 20.

03:18:32.220 --> 03:18:33.468
MARISHA and LAURA: No!

03:18:33.468 --> 03:18:36.208
MATT: Come look at it. It's right there.

03:18:36.208 --> 03:18:38.544
SAM: I don't believe you. You're the
worst DM ever.

03:18:38.544 --> 03:18:40.184
MATT: With the CR symbol.

03:18:40.184 --> 03:18:42.044
TRAVIS: Oh my god!

03:18:42.044 --> 03:18:43.904
LIAM: You got another hit.

03:18:43.904 --> 03:18:46.114
MARISHA: She's fucking hitting me first!

03:18:46.114 --> 03:18:47.574
TRAVIS: No, that's going to be toast.

03:18:47.574 --> 03:18:48.664
LAURA: That's it.

03:18:48.664 --> 03:18:52.554
TALIESIN: I'm going to cancel the effect of the
20, but the hit still happens.

03:18:52.554 --> 03:18:54.955
MATT: Okay, make a sleight of hand check for me.

03:18:54.955 --> 03:18:55.797
LAURA: No!

03:18:55.797 --> 03:18:57.344
TALIESIN: Oh, should I not?

03:18:57.344 --> 03:18:58.581
SAM: Do whatever you want.

03:18:58.581 --> 03:19:00.715
MARISHA: Do it! Whatever you're doing, do it!

03:19:00.715 --> 03:19:04.309
TALIESIN: No, I thought about it, nah. Let's let
this happen. Such an invaluable lesson to be

03:19:04.309 --> 03:19:05.785
learned here, the more I think about it.

03:19:05.785 --> 03:19:07.978
LIAM: Caleb's been wanting to cheat
this <i>whole</i> time.

03:19:07.978 --> 03:19:09.493
MATT: Okay, it's ten points of bludgeoning
damage to you.

03:19:09.493 --> 03:19:10.445
LIAM: Oh, she's down.

03:19:10.445 --> 03:19:11.432
MARISHA: I'm out.

03:19:11.432 --> 03:19:12.759
TALIESIN: Spare the Dying.

03:19:12.879 --> 03:19:20.590
MATT: With that, the final knuckle punch, there's
this (echoing impact). The room gets quiet as you

03:19:20.590 --> 03:19:26.068
hear the breath suddenly fill the lungs of every
creature watching in the room, and Beau stumbles

03:19:26.068 --> 03:19:31.456
back. Grin curls up on the face as one eye closes--

03:19:31.456 --> 03:19:32.456
MARISHA: So close.

03:19:32.456 --> 03:19:34.216
TRAVIS: I know your pain right now.

03:19:34.318 --> 03:19:38.376
--and then (impact) face first into the gravel. The

03:19:38.376 --> 03:19:47.768
room erupts into cheers and laughter and drinks,
whatever. The drow looks over and walks over,

03:19:47.768 --> 03:19:50.205
wobbles for a second. Two hit points.

03:19:50.205 --> 03:19:51.826
MARISHA: (frustrated yell)

03:19:51.827 --> 03:19:53.216
TRAVIS: No!

03:19:53.216 --> 03:19:54.887
LAURA: That is exactly what happened to Grog!

03:19:54.887 --> 03:19:56.987
TRAVIS: That's exactly what happened
in the crucible!

03:19:56.987 --> 03:19:58.220
MATT: It's Kern 2.0!

03:19:58.220 --> 03:20:00.236
TRAVIS: Oh my god!

03:20:00.745 --> 03:20:03.466
TALIESIN: I'm going to wake the two of them up
really quick.

03:20:03.466 --> 03:20:06.735
SAM: As people are cheering, I'm going to pull the
diamond.

03:20:06.735 --> 03:20:09.416
TALIESIN: Nine points for you, nine points for
you, you're both--

03:20:09.416 --> 03:20:12.826
MATT: Roll a sleight of hand check. This is
against the monk's perception.

03:20:12.826 --> 03:20:15.515
LIAM: At advantage with everybody going crazy?

03:20:15.515 --> 03:20:17.455
MATT: No, not this monk.

03:20:17.687 --> 03:20:26.681
SAM: It's 23 and I'm going to fling the diamond
towards that goblin who saw it but try to aim into

03:20:26.681 --> 03:20:29.556
the pocket of the guy standing next to him.

03:20:30.703 --> 03:20:36.386
MATT: Interesting. Okay. It darts past. The monk
does not notice actually, did not roll a high

03:20:36.386 --> 03:20:43.777
enough perception. Goes and starts collecting the
winnings and putting them into the pouches. The

03:20:43.777 --> 03:20:50.346
diamond zooms past the goblin's face, goes (noises
of surprise), and sees where it went in the guy's

03:20:50.346 --> 03:20:56.607
pocket and goes, "Hey! What are you doing?!" and
reaches into the pocket, and standing next to it

03:20:56.607 --> 03:21:02.787
is this big orc wearing hide armor across the
chest. Series of scars across each arm with some

03:21:02.787 --> 03:21:09.947
rickety looking tattoos on each forearm. The guy
goes like, "What? What you want?" Goblin's like,

03:21:09.947 --> 03:21:17.418
"Give it back!" Goes and pulls open the belt pouch
and a few chunks of dried meat tumble out and the

03:21:17.418 --> 03:21:24.246
diamond (tumbling noise) on the ground. The orc
goes, "Whoa!" and reaches down for it and the

03:21:24.246 --> 03:21:28.536
goblin's like, "No! This is mine!" The orc just
goes, "Pfft." Grabs the goblin's arm and lifts him

03:21:28.536 --> 03:21:35.167
up off the ground, pries it from his fingers. The
goblin's like, "Ah!" (snickering) Throws it down.

03:21:35.167 --> 03:21:42.046
Turns around and one of the Kryn warriors who's
been watching in the corner in full armor and

03:21:42.046 --> 03:21:52.924
helmet looks right at the orc and goes-- and the
orc goes (disappointed sigh) and sheepishly walks

03:21:52.924 --> 03:21:56.778
over towards the monk as she's collecting her
winnings and hands it to her.

03:21:56.778 --> 03:21:58.066
LAURA: She didn't even see it!

03:21:58.066 --> 03:21:59.766
SAM: Damn guards.

03:22:01.537 --> 03:22:11.097
MATT: As the insanity dies down, Caduceus helps
you up. The ogre gets up and is like (painful

03:22:11.097 --> 03:22:21.577
groans) rubbing his crotch area. Seems to be
pressing the flesh to try and find out where one

03:22:21.577 --> 03:22:24.777
of the testicles may have been lodged upward in
the body.

03:22:24.777 --> 03:22:26.477
TRAVIS: It's in there somewhere.

03:22:26.477 --> 03:22:28.407
TALIESIN: It's on a vision quest.

03:22:30.176 --> 03:22:38.537
MATT: It's already to Ghor Dranas; it beat you
there. Everything calms down a bit and whereas

03:22:38.537 --> 03:22:45.327
when you enter the room, there was that-- the
glares of, "What the fuck is this human doing

03:22:45.327 --> 03:22:49.662
here?" and your activities as you entered didn't
seem to improve that. When the fight is over,

03:22:49.662 --> 03:22:55.298
these same creatures and most everyone in the room
gives you this nod of respect. Even though you

03:22:55.298 --> 03:23:00.156
didn't win the bout, there seems to be at least an
appreciation of what you managed to accomplish.

03:23:00.156 --> 03:23:03.209
MARISHA: Fucking-- that's all I wanted.

03:23:03.826 --> 03:23:08.025
MATT: What are the rest of you guys doing as Beau
and Jester-- Jester, as you walk by to--

03:23:08.025 --> 03:23:11.576
MARISHA: I help Jester up (groan).

03:23:11.576 --> 03:23:17.695
MATT: The ogre doesn't even approach either of
you. He's extremely embarrassed by the display--

03:23:17.695 --> 03:23:21.786
MARISHA: Sorry, I have bat guano in my eye. And
blood.

03:23:21.880 --> 03:23:24.082
SAM: You guys did really good!

03:23:24.082 --> 03:23:26.453
LAURA: I fell first, you guys.

03:23:26.453 --> 03:23:29.759
SAM: Well, I mean, we all knew that that was going
to happen--

03:23:29.759 --> 03:23:32.164
LAURA: Sort of a little bit, yeah.

03:23:32.164 --> 03:23:34.334
SAM: Beau, you almost won.

03:23:34.334 --> 03:23:35.777
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

03:23:35.777 --> 03:23:37.622
LIAM: Did you learn anything?

03:23:37.622 --> 03:23:40.902
MARISHA: Yeah, I need to get better at beating
people's asses.

03:23:40.902 --> 03:23:42.853
LIAM: Nuanced, I like it.

03:23:42.853 --> 03:23:44.223
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:23:44.527 --> 03:23:49.554
MATT: There's the squeak of wood on the stone
floor of the establishment as a chair gets pushed

03:23:49.554 --> 03:23:56.747
up the table, and the drow monk that you had just
fought sits down at the table with you.

03:23:56.747 --> 03:24:03.123
MARISHA: Yeah. Yes. This is where this is all
leading. Yeah.

03:24:07.122 --> 03:24:17.403
MATT: "I get the feeling that perhaps there is
more than meets the eye amongst you all. You don't

03:24:17.403 --> 03:24:21.693
smell of this land. I'm--"

03:24:21.693 --> 03:24:24.104
MARISHA: Sorry, you go ahead.

03:24:24.104 --> 03:24:28.134
MATT: "I'm impressed. What do you want?"

03:24:29.756 --> 03:24:34.187
MARISHA: I can see we're cut from the same cloth.
Where'd you train?

03:24:37.077 --> 03:24:42.676
MATT: "Perhaps this is not the best place to talk.
Come walk with me." The monk stands up and

03:24:42.676 --> 03:24:44.925
leaves the Four Corners.

03:24:45.820 --> 03:24:46.834
MARISHA: Wait a minute--

03:24:46.834 --> 03:24:48.977
LAURA: Did that talk count as a short rest?

03:24:48.977 --> 03:24:50.026
MATT: No.

03:24:51.616 --> 03:24:55.288
TRAVIS: Is there one entrance and exit out of the
Four Corners? One door?

03:24:55.288 --> 03:25:00.007
MATT: There is a back exit, but you watch as the
monk leaves through the front.

03:25:00.007 --> 03:25:01.637
TRAVIS: I'll head up for the back.

03:25:01.637 --> 03:25:02.717
MATT: Okay.

03:25:02.717 --> 03:25:04.416
MARISHA: I wait a minute.

03:25:04.416 --> 03:25:06.526
LAURA: I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on myself.

03:25:06.526 --> 03:25:08.097
MATT: Okay.

03:25:08.303 --> 03:25:09.607
MARISHA: Wait for Jester.

03:25:09.607 --> 03:25:11.116
LAURA: I'll cast Cure Wounds on you, too.

03:25:11.116 --> 03:25:12.686
MARISHA: Oh, thank you.

03:25:13.757 --> 03:25:16.158
LAURA: Hold on, at second level.

03:25:16.377 --> 03:25:18.198
LIAM: Where are they leaving, over there?

03:25:18.198 --> 03:25:22.397
MATT: They're exiting through the front door this
way. Fjord, you're going through this exit, you said?

03:25:22.397 --> 03:25:24.379
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm. I'll wrap around.

03:25:24.379 --> 03:25:25.815
LAURA: 14 points.

03:25:25.815 --> 03:25:28.127
MARISHA: Yay, thank you! That is not bad.

03:25:28.127 --> 03:25:31.348
MATT: Yasha goes ahead and joins you as well,
heads out the back.

03:25:31.628 --> 03:25:33.437
TALIESIN: Where's-- oh, okay.

03:25:33.437 --> 03:25:34.803
SAM: We're leaving, come on.

03:25:34.803 --> 03:25:36.227
TALIESIN: What? I'm going to follow wherever
you're going.

03:25:36.227 --> 03:25:37.226
TRAVIS: Out the back door.

03:25:37.226 --> 03:25:38.292
TALIESIN: What? Yeah, okay.

03:25:38.292 --> 03:25:39.487
SAM: I'll go out the back door, too.

03:25:39.487 --> 03:25:41.088
MARISHA: I go out the front.

03:25:41.088 --> 03:25:44.602
MATT: All right. As both Jester and Beau leave, a
few of the patrons raise a glass and

03:25:44.602 --> 03:25:47.018
(deep chuckle), "Very good!"

03:25:47.018 --> 03:25:48.967
LAURA: Thank you.

03:25:50.838 --> 03:25:55.050
TRAVIS: (laughing) The most polite Four Corners
combatant ever.

03:25:57.747 --> 03:26:03.062
MATT: As you follow out the front, the monk is
passing on the north road around the corner and--

03:26:03.062 --> 03:26:05.032
make a perception check, Fjord.

03:26:08.388 --> 03:26:10.696
TRAVIS: Ugh. Eight.

03:26:10.696 --> 03:26:15.966
MATT: You back around the backside of the building
and you lose everyone. You're like: Uh...

03:26:16.517 --> 03:26:18.047
where did they go?

03:26:18.047 --> 03:26:21.126
TRAVIS: Uh... Yeah, I just pick a direction and
start jogging.

03:26:21.126 --> 03:26:22.827
TALIESIN: Never again.

03:26:22.827 --> 03:26:28.146
MATT: Roll a new character. Most
unceremonious end.

03:26:29.326 --> 03:26:30.436
SAM: Guys?!

03:26:30.533 --> 03:26:33.494
MATT: Rolled perception so low he left the campaign.

03:26:33.494 --> 03:26:35.463
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

03:26:35.463 --> 03:26:40.102
(laughter)

03:26:42.463 --> 03:26:45.403
LIAM: I want to wait just half a second and follow
out the front door.

03:26:45.403 --> 03:26:47.226
MATT: Okay. So--

03:26:47.226 --> 03:26:50.464
MARISHA: I see her go around the corner? To the
east, you said?

03:26:50.464 --> 03:26:56.963
MATT: You do, actually. As you leave and look out,
she is about two blocks up the way and is leaning

03:26:56.963 --> 03:27:01.231
against the wall looking over the shoulder to see
you exit, and as soon as you step out into the

03:27:01.231 --> 03:27:03.613
road, ducks into an alley.

03:27:03.613 --> 03:27:11.223
MARISHA: Okay. Do I get the sense that the alley
spills out the other side? Can I go up a block and

03:27:11.223 --> 03:27:13.721
then block around behind?

03:27:13.721 --> 03:27:16.054
MATT: It might. You haven't walked over in that
area.

03:27:16.054 --> 03:27:17.633
MARISHA: Let's try that.

03:27:17.633 --> 03:27:21.433
LAURA: Sure. What if she like, you know, just
wants to make out with you or something? Do you

03:27:21.433 --> 03:27:23.853
think-- am I intruding?

03:27:23.853 --> 03:27:29.132
MARISHA: No. I mean, you can watch. Would that
make you uncomfortable? Nah, anyway--

03:27:29.132 --> 03:27:30.683
it's kind of a joke.

03:27:30.683 --> 03:27:31.682
LAURA: Okay.

03:27:31.682 --> 03:27:34.323
MARISHA: Yeah. What if she's the spy?

03:27:34.323 --> 03:27:36.063
LAURA: I think she might be.

03:27:36.063 --> 03:27:37.756
MARISHA: I think she might be.

03:27:37.756 --> 03:27:39.162
LAURA: What if she thinks <i>you</i> are?

03:27:39.162 --> 03:27:40.241
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

03:27:40.241 --> 03:27:41.507
MARISHA: I thought about that too.

03:27:41.507 --> 03:27:42.974
LAURA: What if she's actually planning
on killing you?

03:27:42.974 --> 03:27:44.113
TRAVIS: Collecting the bounty?

03:27:44.113 --> 03:27:45.143
MARISHA: Mm, it's possible.

03:27:45.143 --> 03:27:48.223
LAURA: We don't have a lot of health right now;
we took a beating.

03:27:48.262 --> 03:27:49.536
MARISHA: We did.

03:27:49.536 --> 03:27:51.413
TRAVIS: You should definitely go by yourselves.

03:27:51.413 --> 03:27:53.403
LIAM: She's probably waiting in an alleyway
right now.

03:27:53.403 --> 03:27:55.029
MARISHA: Literally waiting to murder me.

03:27:55.029 --> 03:27:57.262
LAURA: But you know what? She also took a
beating.

03:27:57.262 --> 03:27:58.343
MARISHA: She did.

03:27:58.343 --> 03:28:04.302
LAURA: Now it's two against one and we sort of
healed up a little bit, so fuck her and we can do it.

03:28:05.385 --> 03:28:08.971
MARISHA: Yeah, I thought about that too, and I'm
sure other people are looking for this--

03:28:08.971 --> 03:28:12.582
MATT: She looks hurt enough to have been when she
exited at two hit points.

03:28:13.342 --> 03:28:15.121
MARISHA and LAURA: Let's go.

03:28:16.632 --> 03:28:20.421
MATT: All right. Who all's going with Beau? Yasha
and you are at the back trying to--

03:28:20.421 --> 03:28:21.763
TRAVIS: Lost as fuck.

03:28:21.763 --> 03:28:22.783
MATT: Just lost.

03:28:22.783 --> 03:28:25.293
TALIESIN: I'm watching them, just like, I don't
know what's happening. This is great.

03:28:26.196 --> 03:28:29.470
MATT: (laughing) So Caduceus and Fjord and Yasha
are tourists--

03:28:29.470 --> 03:28:31.301
SAM: I went back with them too.

03:28:31.301 --> 03:28:33.431
MATT: All right. Nott catches up--

03:28:33.431 --> 03:28:35.431
SAM: Where are we going?

03:28:35.431 --> 03:28:37.456
TRAVIS: We're going to catch up with um--

03:28:38.864 --> 03:28:40.353
with uh--

03:28:42.155 --> 03:28:46.279
we're going to... (whistles). Hey!

03:28:46.279 --> 03:28:47.280
TALIESIN: Yeah?

03:28:49.188 --> 03:28:50.338
TRAVIS: Fuck.

03:28:50.338 --> 03:28:53.450
SAM: I can send a message if I know which
direction they are, so I'm going to pick a

03:28:53.450 --> 03:28:56.240
direction. Caleb, can you hear me?

03:28:57.100 --> 03:28:58.039
MATT: No.

03:28:58.039 --> 03:28:59.115
SAM: Shit.

03:29:00.802 --> 03:29:05.733
TRAVIS: Let's-- we'll head towards the center of
the-- yeah.

03:29:05.733 --> 03:29:14.992
SAM: The Aurora? The Aurora Hold? The tower. The
bar? Shit, we need a leader!

03:29:14.992 --> 03:29:18.102
(laughter)

03:29:18.645 --> 03:29:21.645
LIAM: I think the ladies probably have it, but I'm
going to do a little choo-choo train. I snap

03:29:21.645 --> 03:29:26.792
Frumpkin here. Frumpkin will follow them by 15
feet and I will follow Frumpkin 15 back.

03:29:26.792 --> 03:29:28.252
MATT: Okay.

03:29:28.252 --> 03:29:30.477
TRAVIS: The Scowl's Square, sorry. That's what I
was looking for in my notes.

03:29:30.477 --> 03:29:34.253
LIAM: If we get to the corner and they go in, I'm
going to wait at the corner and Frumpkin will go

03:29:34.253 --> 03:29:35.993
around a little bit.

03:29:35.993 --> 03:29:42.864
MATT: Okay. Both of you follow into the alleyway
and, about two buildings down to the left, there

03:29:42.864 --> 03:29:47.882
appears to be a storage shack of some kind, and
you see the monk is standing with the door ajar

03:29:47.882 --> 03:29:52.362
and gives a nod to you, and then enters and closes
the door behind.

03:29:52.362 --> 03:29:54.992
MARISHA: I turn around and make sure no one's
following, no one saw us.

03:29:54.992 --> 03:29:56.033
MATT: Perception check.

03:29:57.582 --> 03:30:01.159
MARISHA: Don't fuck me. Okay, okay, okay. 22.

03:30:01.159 --> 03:30:06.482
MATT: 22. Looking around, you see Caleb. You see
Frumpkin. But no one seems to be specifically

03:30:06.482 --> 03:30:09.419
following you. I mean, you don't even know where
the rest of your party is.

03:30:09.419 --> 03:30:10.719
MARISHA: Okay.

03:30:10.719 --> 03:30:11.989
TRAVIS: Lost as fuck.

03:30:11.989 --> 03:30:17.643
MARISHA: I just give a nod to Caleb and then
go with Jester to the door.

03:30:17.738 --> 03:30:21.237
TALIESIN: This is a-- this way's a circle line so
we have to-- we may have--

03:30:21.237 --> 03:30:23.246
TRAVIS: Yeah, I feel like we were supposed to be
on the red.

03:30:23.246 --> 03:30:26.255
TALIESIN: There's no beginning or end to it. It's
the red checkered line that we need.

03:30:26.255 --> 03:30:29.542
LIAM: I'm going to sprint Frumpkin up and he will
climb up Jester's back.

03:30:29.542 --> 03:30:33.555
MATT: Okay. Frumpkin comes up and perches around
the back of your neck.

03:30:33.555 --> 03:30:36.226
LAURA: Sprinkle seems very uncomfortable
with this.

03:30:36.226 --> 03:30:37.646
MATT: Puffs up and--

03:30:37.646 --> 03:30:39.787
LAURA: Nugget also is not too fond of it.

03:30:39.787 --> 03:30:41.527
TALIESIN: You're a menagerie right now.

03:30:41.527 --> 03:30:43.956
MATT: (laughs) Just a walking petting zoo.

03:30:43.956 --> 03:30:46.245
SAM: Where were they during the fight?

03:30:46.245 --> 03:30:49.367
LAURA: Sitting off to the side with Fjord,
obviously.

03:30:49.367 --> 03:30:55.615
MATT: All right. You guys enter-- I mean, it looks
like a slightly larger outhouse. As the door

03:30:55.615 --> 03:31:00.115
opens-- thankfully it's not an outhouse-- the
smell that gets to you is like musty grains.

03:31:00.115 --> 03:31:01.800
MARISHA: Musty grains.

03:31:01.800 --> 03:31:03.026
TALIESIN: Good band.

03:31:03.026 --> 03:31:06.225
MATT: But since there aren't a lot of grain fields
in the area, you're not sure what the smell's

03:31:06.225 --> 03:31:10.388
coming from. But there are a few dried sacks and
one looks like the bottom is somewhat mildewing

03:31:10.388 --> 03:31:14.563
from maybe some moisture that may have gotten in
from a nearby rain through the roof. But the

03:31:14.563 --> 03:31:19.426
chamber is about ten foot by eight foot and it's a
very, very tight space. But in the back corner,

03:31:19.426 --> 03:31:22.876
you see the Drow, arms crossed, looking at you
expectantly.

03:31:22.876 --> 03:31:26.136
LAURA: Did you call us here to give us back the
diamond that we gave you because

03:31:26.136 --> 03:31:27.445
that's very kind of you--

03:31:27.445 --> 03:31:28.272
MATT: "Close the door."

03:31:28.272 --> 03:31:29.305
LAURA: Okay.

03:31:29.305 --> 03:31:30.576
(laughter)

03:31:32.137 --> 03:31:39.416
MATT: You close the door. It is dark. You can't
see anything, Beau. You put the goggles on. You

03:31:39.416 --> 03:31:43.506
see the monk reaches into their pouch and tosses
the diamond back to you.

03:31:43.506 --> 03:31:45.196
SAM: (surprised yelling)

03:31:45.196 --> 03:31:46.356
LAURA: Say what?!

03:31:46.356 --> 03:31:47.728
SAM: Best fight ever.

03:31:47.728 --> 03:31:50.676
MATT: You watch as the image of the monk
shifts and fades.

03:31:50.676 --> 03:31:52.936
LIAM: Oh shit.

03:31:52.936 --> 03:32:03.026
MATT: What you see is a female elf. Dark skin, no
hair, pointed ears and the familiar blue and grey

03:32:03.026 --> 03:32:05.728
outfit of the monks of the Cobalt Soul.

03:32:05.728 --> 03:32:08.616
(yelling)

03:32:08.616 --> 03:32:11.287
MARISHA: I fucking knew it! It's Dairon!
It's Dairon!

03:32:11.287 --> 03:32:12.499
TRAVIS: Holy shit!

03:32:12.499 --> 03:32:14.037
MATT: She looks at you and goes--

03:32:14.037 --> 03:32:15.886
MARISHA: I fucking knew it.

03:32:15.886 --> 03:32:22.286
MATT: "The fact that you're this far, it does not bode
well. I am extremely curious how you happened to--"

03:32:22.286 --> 03:32:24.336
MARISHA: I just go up and I give her a big hug.

03:32:24.336 --> 03:32:26.217
MATT: (surprised noise) (clears throat)

03:32:26.217 --> 03:32:27.727
SAM: (quietly) Just a hug?

03:32:27.727 --> 03:32:31.237
(snickering)

03:32:31.915 --> 03:32:33.529
MARISHA: I thought you were dead.

03:32:33.529 --> 03:32:35.170
LAURA: She's been looking for you.

03:32:35.170 --> 03:32:38.759
MARISHA: You were injured in Blade Garden.
Hadn't heard from you.

03:32:38.759 --> 03:32:41.449
MATT: "Yeah, that was a-- it was a story to tell
everyone--"

03:32:41.449 --> 03:32:42.698
LAURA: (gasps) I sent you a message!

03:32:42.698 --> 03:32:43.486
MATT: "I know."

03:32:43.486 --> 03:32:44.691
LAURA: Do you remember?!

03:32:44.691 --> 03:32:51.669
MATT: "I do remember. But the point was to not
have you follow me East. But here we are.

03:32:52.059 --> 03:32:57.476
"So, at the very least, let us go ahead
and compare notes."

03:32:58.276 --> 03:32:59.776
LAURA: Oh my goodness.

03:32:59.876 --> 03:33:01.591
MATT: That's where we're going to go ahead and
end tonight's session.

03:33:01.591 --> 03:33:03.271
(excited yelling)

03:33:03.271 --> 03:33:06.607
TALIESIN: Oh, I was hoping. I was hoping.

03:33:06.607 --> 03:33:07.961
LAURA: That is so cool!

03:33:07.961 --> 03:33:09.320
TRAVIS: Oh man.

03:33:09.320 --> 03:33:10.868
LAURA: You guys, we didn't lose the diamond.

03:33:10.868 --> 03:33:12.720
SAM: That's the most important.

03:33:12.720 --> 03:33:14.012
MATT: I mean, you're not wrong.

03:33:14.012 --> 03:33:18.822
TRAVIS: Once again, years later, damage dice makes
all the difference.

03:33:18.822 --> 03:33:21.150
LAURA: Aw, yeah. That's what happened in the Grog
fight!

03:33:21.150 --> 03:33:24.730
MATT: (laughing) Yeah. This was Kern 2.0.
Straight up.

03:33:24.730 --> 03:33:31.331
MARISHA: I was rolling d8s and then, at some
point, I looked down and I had d6s in my hand.

03:33:31.331 --> 03:33:33.771
TRAVIS: I watched you roll d6s that whole time.

03:33:33.771 --> 03:33:38.521
MARISHA: Like a decent amount of time. Then I
realized wait, how long have I been rolling d6s?

03:33:38.521 --> 03:33:39.759
Like, I think--

03:33:39.759 --> 03:33:41.401
TRAVIS: Spotlight. Stunts us all.

03:33:41.401 --> 03:33:44.821
MATT: Subconsciously, something in the back of
Beau's mind was causing her to draw--

03:33:44.821 --> 03:33:46.541
to pull the punches a little bit.

03:33:46.541 --> 03:33:47.852
ALL: Ooh.

03:33:47.852 --> 03:33:49.261
TRAVIS: Ooh, ooh, ooh, sexy!

03:33:49.261 --> 03:33:50.853
MATT: Trying to narratively make it work.

03:33:50.853 --> 03:33:52.521
MARISHA: My fists are magical.

03:33:52.521 --> 03:33:56.671
MATT: But we'll pick up on this reunion next week
and see the scenarios working around it.

03:33:56.671 --> 03:33:58.501
TRAVIS: That was a fucking dope fight.

03:33:58.501 --> 03:34:04.141
But until then, we're going to go ahead and get some rest.
Don't forget guys, we just also announced we're

03:34:04.265 --> 03:34:10.412
going to be at Denver Comic Con. For folks in the
Denver area or are looking to travel there for

03:34:10.412 --> 03:34:14.582
that convention, we'll be there! So come say hi.
We've got panels and signings and all kinds of

03:34:14.582 --> 03:34:16.744
cool stuff. Hopefully see you there.

03:34:16.744 --> 03:34:17.992
MARISHA: So excited.

03:34:17.992 --> 03:34:19.268
MATT: Other than that, Monday--

03:34:19.268 --> 03:34:20.342
LAURA: Oh, yeah.

03:34:20.342 --> 03:34:21.558
MATT: Monday, the kickstarter drops for--

03:34:21.558 --> 03:34:22.745
TRAVIS: 10 AM Pacific!

03:34:22.745 --> 03:34:23.764
MATT: Legends of Vox Machina.

03:34:23.764 --> 03:34:24.597
TRAVIS: Tune in!

03:34:24.597 --> 03:34:25.601
TALIESIN: You cannot be prepared.

03:34:25.601 --> 03:34:28.983
MARISHA: We have a Q and A happening on
our channel that night at 7PM.

03:34:28.983 --> 03:34:30.742
TALIESIN: Quois? The quois?

03:34:30.742 --> 03:34:33.759
MARISHA: With you three. To just-- yeah, do the
quois.

03:34:33.759 --> 03:34:38.762
MATT: Talk about the project and everything about
it. So yeah. Some fun stuff, guys. Some fun stuff!

03:34:38.762 --> 03:34:40.092
LAURA: Yay!

03:34:40.092 --> 03:34:43.983
MATT: Thank you so much for watching, guys. We
love you very much, and is it Thursday yet?

03:34:43.983 --> 03:34:44.723
SAM: Yay!

03:34:44.723 --> 03:34:46.121
MATT: Good night.

03:34:46.121 --> 03:34:48.002

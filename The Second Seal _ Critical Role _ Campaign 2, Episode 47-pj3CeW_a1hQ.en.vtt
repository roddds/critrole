00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.417
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us--

00:00:03.758 --> 00:00:11.747
Fuck. Bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit
around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons. That's how to

00:00:11.747 --> 00:00:18.564
start the year. Well done. Welcome. We missed you
guys. Happy new year.

00:00:18.564 --> 00:00:20.254
TRAVIS: 2019!

00:00:20.254 --> 00:00:21.665
MATT: We're here.

00:00:21.665 --> 00:00:22.730
LIAM: We're really glad to be back.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.628
MATT: Holidays were way too short. Or way too
long, or both, depending. Anyway, we're back and

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:32.005
as part of that, we're going to kick in first with
our announcements before we get into tonight's

00:00:32.005 --> 00:00:37.866
episode. First and foremost, we have our fantastic
returning sponsor going into the second year of

00:00:37.866 --> 00:00:41.266
their support of our campaign here in Wildemount:
D&amp;D Beyond.

00:00:41.267 --> 00:00:43.561
ALL: D&amp;D Beyond!

00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:50.607
SAM: So guys, I know we don't get political on
this show a lot. This is a place where we can get

00:00:50.607 --> 00:00:56.515
lost in the story and the characters and not think
about government shutdowns or Dems or Republicans

00:00:56.515 --> 00:01:01.651
and all that. But tonight, I'm going to change all
that. I'm going political. Not just political, I'm

00:01:01.651 --> 00:01:07.157
going super political, because tonight-- it's a
big announcement-- I'm going to announce my

00:01:07.157 --> 00:01:17.804
candidacy. I'm running a campaign. I'm going to
run for the office of president of D&amp;D Beyond.

00:01:17.804 --> 00:01:24.116
This is not a joke. I am running a year-long
campaign that will culminate in a vote, and you

00:01:24.116 --> 00:01:30.255
will elect, I hope, me to be the president of D&amp;D
Beyond. You might have questions. First of all, is

00:01:30.255 --> 00:01:37.651
there a president of D&amp;D Beyond? I don't know. Is
it an elected office? Probably not. But that

00:01:37.651 --> 00:01:42.966
doesn't matter to me, because I am driven to make
this happen. Tonight, I'm going to kick off my

00:01:42.966 --> 00:01:48.187
campaign as every great campaign does-- play that
music-- with a rousing inspirational campaign

00:01:48.187 --> 00:01:57.661
speech. Ahem. When in the course of tabletop RPGs
it becomes necessary to throw off the shackles of

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:03.550
paper and pencil and assume the organizational
powers of the iPad, we hold these truths to be

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.851
self-evident, that all player characters are
created equal, except bards, who are more awesome.

00:02:09.851 --> 00:02:14.570
That all monsters shall be organized, not by the
color of their skin, but by the challenge rating

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:22.101
of their character. That all people enjoy freedom
of religion, except in Wildemount because they be

00:02:22.101 --> 00:02:33.361
assholes. That monks somehow be allowed to attack,
like, 14 times a round. And that everyone sign up

00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:35.385
for D&amp;D Beyond.

00:02:35.385 --> 00:02:36.167
MARISHA: Yes!

00:02:36.167 --> 00:02:42.723
SAM: For too long D&amp;D Beyond has suffered under
the terrible leadership of... someone? I didn't

00:02:42.914 --> 00:02:48.345
look it up, but whoever they are I know they have
failed. For example, have you seen the guy they've

00:02:48.345 --> 00:02:57.939
tapped to do their advertising? Terrible. Friends,
if you elect me, I will-- insert campaign promise

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:04.972
here. Now, I don't know what my campaign promises
are, but I will for the next rally. Ooh, and

00:03:04.973 --> 00:03:11.015
slogans! I need a slogan, and you guys can help.
Something like "Make Exandria Great Again," or "I

00:03:11.015 --> 00:03:20.321
"Like Pike," or "We are All the Sam We Believe In,"
or something? If you have a good slogan for me for

00:03:20.385 --> 00:03:26.719
my campaign, go on Twitter and Tweet it to
@DnDBeyond with the hashtag #SamForPresident. In

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:31.462
conclusion-- conclusion, conclusion, conclusion--

00:03:31.462 --> 00:03:34.387
TRAVIS: It's that empty in there, huh?

00:03:34.387 --> 00:03:39.661
SAM: What do we have to fear but fear itself?
Those who refuse to learn from history are doomed

00:03:39.661 --> 00:03:46.036
to televise the revolution. So ask not what your
country can do for you, let them eat cake. And Mr.

00:03:46.036 --> 00:03:51.561
Gorbachev, tear down this wall! Thank you, and god
bless D&amp;D Beyond.

00:03:51.561 --> 00:03:57.780
(cheering and applause)

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.570
TRAVIS: Where's the wave? There you go!

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:05.190
SAM: There'll be more campaign events as the year
progresses. I'll need to choose a campaign

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:11.835
manager. I'll need some slogans, I'll need some
logos. One of you will be running against me.

00:04:11.836 --> 00:04:14.383
We'll find this out as the year progresses.

00:04:14.383 --> 00:04:17.005
TRAVIS: If you lose, will there be a concession
speech?

00:04:17.005 --> 00:04:18.695
SAM: I won't lose.

00:04:18.695 --> 00:04:19.855
TRAVIS: Oh, okay.

00:04:19.855 --> 00:04:22.147
LAURA: What if none of us want to write a speech?

00:04:22.147 --> 00:04:23.914
SAM: I'll get Dani Carr to do it.

00:04:23.915 --> 00:04:24.984
LAURA: Sweet.

00:04:26.525 --> 00:04:33.530
MATT: All right. Thank you very much, Sam. And
thank you, D&amp;D Beyond. All right.

00:04:33.531 --> 00:04:34.261
LAURA: Sorry.

00:04:34.261 --> 00:04:35.381
LIAM: And also sorry.

00:04:35.381 --> 00:04:39.513
MATT: Also really sorry for everything. Sorry
whoever might be the president of D&amp;D Beyond, so

00:04:39.514 --> 00:04:41.464
sorry. Probably someone at Curse.

00:04:41.464 --> 00:04:43.436
TRAVIS: Sitting at his desk, paranoid, looking
over his shoulder now.

00:04:43.436 --> 00:04:50.645
MATT: With the new year, we have a bunch new shows
coming up. You can join us on Tuesday, January 15,

00:04:50.646 --> 00:04:56.177
next week at 4:00pm Pacific at
twitch.tv/criticalrole for MAME Drop, a new show

00:04:56.177 --> 00:04:59.865
in which we come in and mess around with the
delightful MAME cabinet that we created as part of

00:04:59.865 --> 00:05:05.633
All Work No Play. Super incredible, cutting-edge
technology that was really cool about ten years ago.

00:05:05.633 --> 00:05:09.513
But it took this long for me to actually get one
in my mitts and I'm super excited about it. It's

00:05:09.661 --> 00:05:10.809
awesome! It's the best.

00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:13.857
LAURA: I thought you said cutting-ass technology.

00:05:13.857 --> 00:05:15.805
MATT: It cuts the ass, let me tell you.

00:05:15.805 --> 00:05:18.059
SAM: It should be the phrase.

00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:24.781
MATT: Yeah. On Wednesday, January 23 at 5:00pm
Pacific on our Twitch channel, you can tune in for

00:05:24.781 --> 00:05:31.379
Pub Draw, a new creative series featuring Babs
Tarr, fantastic artist and friend of the show and

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:34.724
the channel, doing fantastic lessons on how to
draw various things.

00:05:34.724 --> 00:05:37.043
MARISHA: Make sure there's no titties, you can't
show nips. Nope, this is fine.

00:05:37.043 --> 00:05:40.011
MATT: Oh, is that Ciri?

00:05:40.011 --> 00:05:41.386
LIAM: (whispering) It's all titties!

00:05:41.386 --> 00:05:42.089
MATT: That's awesome!

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:44.282
MARISHA: Yes, it is. That's totally Ciri. There
you go.

00:05:44.282 --> 00:05:49.195
MATT: I have Witcher-vision. Getting more so with
the gray patch. I haven't grown this out in a long

00:05:49.196 --> 00:05:52.552
time, and when it comes out, and I'm like, "Oh,
I'm getting old. Oh boy."

00:05:52.552 --> 00:05:54.636
LAURA: You didn't know it was going to be there?

00:05:54.636 --> 00:05:56.636
MATT: I knew I was starting to get a little gray,
but--

00:05:56.636 --> 00:05:59.146
TALIESIN: Every time you do one, it's a brand new
surprise.

00:05:59.146 --> 00:06:00.403
LAURA: That's exciting.

00:06:00.403 --> 00:06:02.227
TRAVIS: It's just straight wisdom. That's all it
is.

00:06:02.227 --> 00:06:08.840
MATT: Tackling with your mortality. Finally,
Between The Sheets is coming back, folks. Super

00:06:08.841 --> 00:06:13.991
excited. Join us for the first episode of season
two on Monday, January 28th at 7:00pm Pacific here

00:06:13.991 --> 00:06:18.625
at twitch.tv/criticalrole. We have a lot of really
awesome guests lined up for this. Super excited to

00:06:18.625 --> 00:06:23.266
announce. Nothing yet. Keep an eye on our social
media and such for announcements as they come.

00:06:23.266 --> 00:06:30.784
Also, next week, January 18th through January
20th, we have our first Critical Role art gallery,

00:06:30.784 --> 00:06:35.831
celebrating the fantastic community artists that
have been there from day one and then some that

00:06:35.831 --> 00:06:39.512
have done incredible art pieces that are going to
be on display as a part of the Art of Exandria art

00:06:39.512 --> 00:06:45.277
show. I've been wanting to do this for years. We
finally are able to put it together. Seeing some

00:06:45.277 --> 00:06:47.610
of the art was starting to be putting up.

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.738
LIAM: We were at the gallery yesterday looking at
stuff blown up. We're going to be back tomorrow

00:06:50.738 --> 00:06:56.947
looking at other stuff blown up and it was
overwhelming to see the art that you guys have

00:06:56.947 --> 00:07:01.854
made blown up larger than life. It's going to be
emotional.

00:07:01.854 --> 00:07:06.827
MATT: Over 50 pieces of art will be on display at
the gallery throughout that entire weekend from

00:07:06.827 --> 00:07:11.473
Friday to Sunday of next week. Come and check it
out. That's at Gallery Nucleus. You can look for

00:07:11.473 --> 00:07:19.041
all the info you need about it on
critrole.com/events. And I believe with that--

00:07:19.041 --> 00:07:20.328
LIAM: Wait!

00:07:20.328 --> 00:07:21.799
MATT: Whoa. Wait.

00:07:21.799 --> 00:07:26.424
LIAM: I don't have an announcement, but I just
want to thank a couple of people. First, I want to

00:07:26.425 --> 00:07:32.783
thank @chaotic_redhead on Twitter-- not Marisha
Ray, a different one-- for sending in this great

00:07:32.783 --> 00:07:36.794
hat right here. We got this one.

00:07:36.794 --> 00:07:38.716
SAM: You could use that tonight

00:07:38.716 --> 00:07:40.651
MATT: That's awesome.

00:07:40.651 --> 00:07:47.441
LIAM: That's not the last one. There were four
octopus hats sent in today. Two were for me, and

00:07:47.441 --> 00:07:50.369
two were for Brian Foster.

00:07:50.369 --> 00:07:51.476
MATT: This is magnificent.

00:07:51.476 --> 00:07:52.499
LIAM: Look at this.

00:07:52.499 --> 00:07:53.655
LAURA: Oh my god!

00:07:53.655 --> 00:07:55.510
LIAM: Amazingness. This one--

00:07:55.511 --> 00:07:56.819
MARISHA: Work it.

00:07:56.819 --> 00:08:04.615
LIAM: This one, oh I tell you, this one is from
Knitting Batman on Instagram. No, I cannot see.

00:08:04.615 --> 00:08:08.786
No, I can see!

00:08:08.786 --> 00:08:10.047
MARISHA: That's the point of all of this.

00:08:10.047 --> 00:08:12.081
LIAM: Yeah. As you were, Matthew.

00:08:12.081 --> 00:08:15.256
TRAVIS: Leave it on. Please, leave it on.

00:08:15.256 --> 00:08:17.729
LAURA: It looks like beautiful curls.

00:08:17.729 --> 00:08:20.308
TRAVIS: I want to have a dramatic interaction with
that, please!

00:08:20.309 --> 00:08:28.420
MATT: Find Familiar is now the best feat or best
spell. So hold that because I'm going to hold that

00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:36.359
to you whenever you start using Frumpkin in that
way. Keep it on standby. All right. I believe now,

00:08:36.359 --> 00:08:45.786
without further ado, let's jump in to the first
2019 episode of Critical Role.

00:08:48.233 --> 00:08:50.704
[water bubbling]

00:08:50.704 --> 00:08:54.007
[thunder]

00:08:55.218 --> 00:08:57.024
[explosion]

00:08:57.164 --> 00:09:01.076
(chanting) Role! Critical! Role!

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:09.795
[dramatic Critical Role theme]

00:09:09.795 --> 00:09:19.101
LAURA: Roll the dice! (singing) The adventure
begins, they were always beside you, your nerdy

00:09:19.101 --> 00:09:26.672
best friends, and the DM to guide you. And they
rise from the flames for the battles ahead.

00:09:26.672 --> 00:09:30.519
Villains beware 'cause you're about to be dead.

00:09:35.078 --> 00:09:40.518
ASHLEY: (singing) They got magic and flair, they
got falchions and cunning. They don't see over

00:09:40.518 --> 00:09:48.028
there there's a monster incoming. Inspiration is
waiting, rise up, don't think twice. Put your fate

00:09:48.028 --> 00:09:51.161
in your hands, take a chance, roll the dice!

00:09:52.534 --> 00:10:00.370
(chanting) Role! Critical! Role!

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:05.460
ASHLEY and LAURA: (singing) Can you answer the
call? Diggin' deep in your soul as the legend

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:15.064
unfolds. Now it's your turn to roll!

00:10:16.343 --> 00:10:23.301
[fire burning]

00:10:23.302 --> 00:10:35.529
MATT: Welcome back. Last we left off, The Mighty
Nein after surviving their encounters in Darktow,

00:10:35.529 --> 00:10:44.460
traveling to and from Urukayxl and managing to
release one of the gathered orbs of Uk'otoa's

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:52.050
sealing. You made your way to the depths of the
Diver's Grave and recovered the third of these

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:58.348
orbs that you've come across. Two of which now
reside within Fjord's person. You then proceeded

00:10:58.348 --> 00:11:02.929
on towards what you believed to be the location of
one of these temples through a series of visions

00:11:02.929 --> 00:11:12.749
you've had by Uk'otoa. I knew it was coming. You
made your way towards this archipelago. Looked

00:11:12.749 --> 00:11:17.770
around, set your ship in the center, cast Water
Breathing on the group, and you all dove down

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:26.228
beneath the waters and found this slightly angled
ruin. This partially crumbled temple that sits

00:11:26.229 --> 00:11:32.014
there at the base of the ocean floor. You saw
long, straggling pieces of seaweed slowly waving

00:11:32.014 --> 00:11:37.091
with the water and what looked to be drowned
bodies tangled in them that upon your approach,

00:11:37.091 --> 00:11:42.299
began to clamber towards you. You fought off a
number of them, managed to clear that space and

00:11:42.299 --> 00:11:47.384
then investigate within the interior of this
temple tower. Looking inside with a bit of light,

00:11:47.384 --> 00:11:53.850
there looked to be some sort of large, mutant
crustacean-like creatures all gathered up on the

00:11:53.850 --> 00:12:04.279
inside. Not entirely certain of the number, just a
series of claws and armor and barnacles. Backing

00:12:04.279 --> 00:12:09.893
away, you all just set yourselves on the ocean
floor about 50, 60 feet away from the base

00:12:09.893 --> 00:12:18.509
doorway. And that's where we left off. So Mighty
Nein, let's go ahead and roll initiative.

00:12:18.509 --> 00:12:20.849
TRAVIS: Oh shit, just getting in it.

00:12:20.849 --> 00:12:22.542
LIAM: I forgot how to play.

00:12:22.542 --> 00:12:24.127
LAURA: I know. I did, too!

00:12:24.127 --> 00:12:26.207
MATT: Well, you better hurry up quickly.

00:12:26.207 --> 00:12:27.726
LAURA: Oh no!

00:12:27.726 --> 00:12:30.180
LIAM: Oh, I rolled a natural 20! I did it. I
remembered.

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:31.161
SAM: Wow!

00:12:31.162 --> 00:12:31.911
TRAVIS: Did you really?

00:12:31.911 --> 00:12:32.727
LIAM: Yes, I did!

00:12:32.727 --> 00:12:33.852
TRAVIS: That's amazing.

00:12:33.852 --> 00:12:38.086
SAM: Are we all at the top of the tower? Are some
of us at the bottom of the tower?

00:12:38.086 --> 00:12:41.729
TRAVIS: That's totally an Ashley roll. Jesus.

00:12:41.729 --> 00:12:45.168
SAM and LAURA: Whoa!

00:12:45.168 --> 00:12:49.758
TALIESIN and LAURA: (humming the intro to "Under
the Sea")

00:12:53.188 --> 00:12:56.008
TRAVIS: Under the sea--

00:12:56.459 --> 00:12:59.324
LAURA: Aw, see? That should've been on your
playlist.

00:12:59.325 --> 00:13:00.654
SAM: Next one.

00:13:00.654 --> 00:13:02.698
MATT: Organize yourself where you would like to be
in this area.

00:13:02.698 --> 00:13:04.694
SAM: Were we all together? We were all together at
the base of the tower.

00:13:04.694 --> 00:13:08.818
MATT: You said you were all together about 50 to
60 feet away from the base of the tower.

00:13:08.818 --> 00:13:11.853
LIAM: This is after lighting up the inside and
then backing away from it? Is that how it went down?

00:13:12.223 --> 00:13:15.740
MATT: You were clambering on top of it, looked
inside, and then moved off of the edge.

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:18.000
LAURA: That's the door that I'm seeing right
here?

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.355
TRAVIS: Yeah, we sent in the dead guy through that
door. Is it just on the other side of this greefy.

00:13:21.355 --> 00:13:23.259
Greefy? Sure.

00:13:23.259 --> 00:13:24.934
LAURA: The greefy right there? Yeah.

00:13:24.934 --> 00:13:27.558
MATT: A little greefy? Like that greefy?

00:13:27.558 --> 00:13:31.593
TRAVIS: I like the water. I like the water!

00:13:31.593 --> 00:13:34.668
SAM: Is there a door on the other side?

00:13:34.668 --> 00:13:37.218
TRAVIS: We should kick up a bunch of sediment and
hide!

00:13:37.218 --> 00:13:42.519
MATT: What you know right now there's just this
one door here and a lot of cracked sections of the stone.

00:13:42.519 --> 00:13:46.872
LAURA: Didn't we have-- No. Did we? Was that a
different time?

00:13:46.872 --> 00:13:47.887
TRAVIS: What?

00:13:47.888 --> 00:13:50.135
LAURA: Our seaweed stealths.

00:13:50.135 --> 00:13:51.723
TRAVIS: We did coming up to this.

00:13:51.723 --> 00:13:52.818
LIAM: That was earlier.

00:13:52.818 --> 00:13:53.922
LAURA: Okay.

00:13:53.922 --> 00:13:56.822
TRAVIS: I think it's been ten minutes.

00:13:56.822 --> 00:13:58.221
MATT: Initiatives. 25 to 20?

00:13:58.221 --> 00:13:59.047
MARISHA: 22.

00:13:59.047 --> 00:13:59.727
LIAM: 21.

00:13:59.727 --> 00:14:00.577
SAM: 22!

00:14:00.577 --> 00:14:01.743
MARISHA: Ooh!

00:14:01.743 --> 00:14:02.625
TRAVIS: Damn!

00:14:02.625 --> 00:14:05.693
SAM: Look at all of us!

00:14:05.693 --> 00:14:08.451
LAURA: This tastes like salisbury steak.

00:14:08.451 --> 00:14:11.182
SAM: You eat a hamburger with a fork and knife?

00:14:11.182 --> 00:14:12.387
LAURA: It's really messy!

00:14:12.387 --> 00:14:13.988
SAM: Are you a communist?

00:14:13.989 --> 00:14:14.972
TRAVIS: Pay attention!

00:14:14.972 --> 00:14:16.766
MATT: 20 to 15?

00:14:16.766 --> 00:14:18.035
TRAVIS: Nobody 20 to 15?

00:14:18.035 --> 00:14:19.131
SAM: Oh boy.

00:14:19.131 --> 00:14:20.220
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:22.468
TALIESIN: Tiny violin.

00:14:23.107 --> 00:14:24.406
MATT: 15 to ten?

00:14:24.407 --> 00:14:25.353
TRAVIS: 12.

00:14:25.353 --> 00:14:26.616
LAURA and TALIESIN: 11.

00:14:26.616 --> 00:14:32.707
MATT: All right. Fjord, Jester, and Caduceus.

00:14:32.707 --> 00:14:37.850
TRAVIS: Yasha rolled a seven. Sorry, Ashley.

00:14:40.909 --> 00:14:43.932
SAM: We haven't been attacked yet. We just heard a
commotion inside?

00:14:43.932 --> 00:14:44.940
MATT: Correct.

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.365
SAM: Okay.

00:14:46.365 --> 00:14:52.580
TRAVIS: (laughing) That is such a benign
"Correct." Sure, nothing wrong here in the middle

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:54.148
of initiative.

00:14:54.148 --> 00:14:58.767
MATT: Beau, Nott? You guys are up first. Nott has
a higher dexterity, so technically, you can go

00:14:58.767 --> 00:15:01.295
first unless you want to coordinate something
together.

00:15:01.295 --> 00:15:04.271
SAM: What are we doing?

00:15:04.271 --> 00:15:06.911
MARISHA: What are we doing? What's happening?

00:15:06.911 --> 00:15:10.835
SAM: Should we go in and investigate through one
of these cracks?

00:15:10.836 --> 00:15:13.513
MARISHA: Do you want to flank and we can kind of
peek in?

00:15:13.513 --> 00:15:14.838
SAM: Sure.

00:15:14.838 --> 00:15:16.724
MARISHA: Do a little scouting?

00:15:16.725 --> 00:15:20.410
TRAVIS: I mean, clearly the top is the damage,
right?

00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:22.031
SAM: Is the damage? What does that mean?

00:15:22.032 --> 00:15:24.295
TRAVIS: Well, I mean, they're big we think,
right?

00:15:24.295 --> 00:15:25.324
TALIESIN: We saw them.

00:15:25.324 --> 00:15:27.621
TRAVIS: They're not going to come through that
little door, right?

00:15:27.621 --> 00:15:29.649
MARISHA: The crustacean things?

00:15:29.649 --> 00:15:32.515
TRAVIS: The crustacean things. Of which, I think
there are three.

00:15:32.515 --> 00:15:34.475
TALIESIN: We don't know how many. There were a lot
of them moving around.

00:15:34.475 --> 00:15:36.048
MATT: You saw a lot of movement inside.

00:15:36.048 --> 00:15:40.796
SAM: Why don't we get close to the door in case
something comes out, and we'll ready our attacks?

00:15:40.796 --> 00:15:41.447
MARISHA: Okay.

00:15:41.447 --> 00:15:43.782
TALIESIN: I was going to say, it's been a while. I
thought the plan was to draw things out through

00:15:43.782 --> 00:15:44.905
the door.

00:15:44.905 --> 00:15:45.501
TRAVIS: It was.

00:15:45.501 --> 00:15:46.052
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:15:46.052 --> 00:15:50.447
SAM: Oh! Then that's works well for our previously
aforementioned plan.

00:15:50.447 --> 00:15:55.146
MARISHA: Yeah, let's do that. Nott and I will get
in position, flank the door, and hold our attacks

00:15:55.146 --> 00:15:56.757
in case something runs out.

00:15:56.757 --> 00:15:57.964
SAM: If we can get that far.

00:15:57.965 --> 00:15:58.595
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:15:58.595 --> 00:16:03.821
MATT: 15, 20 for you for one movement.

00:16:03.821 --> 00:16:07.584
MARISHA: Go ahead and use my bonus.

00:16:07.584 --> 00:16:12.323
MATT: You can use your action to get over here if
you want to, or you can use a ki point and bonus

00:16:12.323 --> 00:16:13.853
because it's half movement.

00:16:13.853 --> 00:16:17.603
MARISHA: Right, and then hold my action. Right? So
I'll do that and use a ki point.

00:16:17.604 --> 00:16:19.653
MATT: Okay. Nott?

00:16:19.653 --> 00:16:25.654
SAM: I will use action and bonus to get over
there-ish. How far can I get?

00:16:25.654 --> 00:16:27.195
MATT: That's as far as you can get.

00:16:27.195 --> 00:16:31.866
SAM: Okay. And I'm somewhat obscured by the
aquarium?

00:16:31.866 --> 00:16:33.370
MATT: Maybe.

00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:43.019
SAM: Okay, and I'll hold action of the Tinkertop
Boltblaster in case anything comes out.

00:16:43.019 --> 00:16:48.220
MATT: You guys slowly bound along the seafloor,
your feet gently pushing into the silt soft

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:53.431
against the base of your foot. You both flank
around each side of the open doorway, preparing

00:16:53.431 --> 00:16:57.151
yourselves for any sort of physical interaction.
Ending both your turns, that brings us to Caleb.

00:16:57.151 --> 00:16:58.353
What are you doing?

00:16:58.354 --> 00:17:06.364
LIAM: I am going to use my movement to get behind
this rock, and I am going to, about 30 feet away

00:17:06.364 --> 00:17:12.627
from Nott, hold the Haste spell for the moment I
see her starting to attack something.

00:17:12.627 --> 00:17:13.348
MATT: To Beau?

00:17:13.348 --> 00:17:14.687
LIAM: No, to Nott.

00:17:14.688 --> 00:17:18.703
MATT: To Nott. Got it. Finishing Caleb's go.

00:17:18.703 --> 00:17:23.454
SAM: Healing potion. So you marked that down?

00:17:23.454 --> 00:17:24.287
LIAM: Yep.

00:17:24.287 --> 00:17:25.603
TRAVIS: It's further around than you think.

00:17:25.603 --> 00:17:27.827
LAURA: What?

00:17:27.827 --> 00:17:29.176
MARISHA: None of us can really see.

00:17:29.176 --> 00:17:29.831
LAURA: Oh, the door.

00:17:29.831 --> 00:17:42.171
MATT: There's a faint pause as you're holding back
and preparing your spell. Two elongated

00:17:42.172 --> 00:17:51.487
bluish-green hands peer through. Some sort of a
humanoid looking creature, but its skin, somewhat

00:17:51.487 --> 00:17:57.993
of a deeper, bluer tint than the fish humanoids
you had battled on the way in. You see it kind of

00:17:57.993 --> 00:18:02.139
peeks through and glances out toward those of you
who that are currently still visible across the

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:08.721
way. Its face humanoid. Eyes a dull, sunken
yellowish-green color, but where its mouth is,

00:18:08.721 --> 00:18:19.251
it's two flaps of skin, like a central mouth that
is vertical. Peeks out, you see rubbery, dark

00:18:19.251 --> 00:18:25.187
tendrils that pull off of its head like a thicker
Predator, just beyond the interior.

00:18:25.188 --> 00:18:26.605
LAURA: Inside?

00:18:26.605 --> 00:18:29.342
MATT: On the inside, yes.

00:18:29.342 --> 00:18:32.335
LIAM: I was a-scared and frightened.

00:18:33.267 --> 00:18:40.629
MATT: As it peers through, its jaw opens up,
splits open. You can see two rows of teeth on the

00:18:40.629 --> 00:18:48.012
inside and the bony projections that holds it open
and gives it this six foot wingspan of open jaw to

00:18:48.012 --> 00:18:55.267
each part. It gives this dull screaming noise as
it begins to dart forward.

00:18:55.267 --> 00:18:56.404
TRAVIS: Six foot?

00:18:56.404 --> 00:18:57.684
LAURA: From the doorway? From where?

00:18:57.684 --> 00:19:03.984
MATT: From the doorway. First off, immediately
Nott and Beau, you were holding actions. Go for it.

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:05.337
MARISHA: (slamming)

00:19:05.337 --> 00:19:07.568
LAURA: Ew, look at it!

00:19:07.568 --> 00:19:12.468
MARISHA: Natural one. (laughs) Happy 2019!

00:19:12.468 --> 00:19:14.820
TRAVIS: What the hell is coming off of it?

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:17.455
LIAM: Trigger Caleb casting Haste on Nott if I saw
her attack.

00:19:17.455 --> 00:19:24.405
MATT: Correct. So for the time being, you are
considered hasted, and Caleb, you are

00:19:24.405 --> 00:19:27.018
concentrating on Haste.

00:19:27.018 --> 00:19:28.830
SAM: But that doesn't apply until my next round.

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:29.478
MATT: Correct.

00:19:29.479 --> 00:19:32.250
SAM: Okay. I rolled a 26 to hit.

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:33.794
MATT: That does hit.

00:19:33.794 --> 00:19:38.993
SAM: Okay, do I get sneak attack? Or does she see
me? He. It.

00:19:38.993 --> 00:19:47.158
MATT: Apparently, it does not see you, and it's
adjacent to Beau at the time as it rushes past

00:19:47.158 --> 00:19:51.382
Beau. It seems more focused on the group in the
back. So your attack does hit, and you do get

00:19:51.383 --> 00:19:52.252
sneak attack.

00:19:52.252 --> 00:20:09.802
SAM: Okay! That is 18 plus eight. That's 26 points
of-- no, plus five, sorry. 25 points of damage.

00:20:09.802 --> 00:20:10.884
MATT: 25 points of damage.

00:20:10.884 --> 00:20:11.597
SAM: Yes.

00:20:11.597 --> 00:20:16.064
MATT: You got it. As the creature begins to skulk
through and kicks off the stone outside of this

00:20:16.064 --> 00:20:21.106
temple, it swims at a faster speed than you were
expecting, and as it darts past Beau, Beau swings

00:20:21.106 --> 00:20:28.047
but goes wide, no impact with the staff. You,
however, use that moment, watch as the bolt from

00:20:28.047 --> 00:20:32.704
the crossbow sinks into its chest. It braces a
bit, but keeps darting forward, using the rest of

00:20:32.704 --> 00:20:35.046
its movement to go.

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:40.862
MARISHA: I turn to the group and I go: One's
coming your way!

00:20:40.862 --> 00:20:42.537
TRAVIS: Yeah, we fucking see it!

00:20:42.537 --> 00:20:45.374
SAM: I turn to the group and go: Ah!

00:20:46.048 --> 00:20:54.098
MATT: It's a unique sound, because you hear Nott's
scream go, "Ah!" right as its voice (roars). It

00:20:54.098 --> 00:20:59.155
screams out this high-pitched, three-toned whine
that causes all of you to reach for your ears. I

00:20:59.155 --> 00:21:03.428
need everybody within 30 feet to make a wisdom
saving throw.

00:21:03.428 --> 00:21:05.553
TALIESIN: You guys get an extra d4.

00:21:05.553 --> 00:21:06.521
LAURA: Yes!

00:21:06.521 --> 00:21:07.254
SAM: We do?

00:21:07.254 --> 00:21:08.303
LAURA: You don't.

00:21:08.304 --> 00:21:10.881
TRAVIS: Natural 20 for Fjord.

00:21:10.881 --> 00:21:12.777
LAURA: Beau, Yasha, and Fjord.

00:21:12.777 --> 00:21:14.039
TALIESIN: Get a d4.

00:21:14.039 --> 00:21:16.501
LAURA: It went 19 and then went to one.

00:21:16.501 --> 00:21:18.095
MARISHA: Jeez louise.

00:21:18.095 --> 00:21:19.876
TRAVIS: A 13 for Yasha.

00:21:19.876 --> 00:21:28.211
MARISHA: Oh, and I get to add a d4 from being
blessed? Okay. 11. Still not good.

00:21:28.211 --> 00:21:36.385
MATT: Yasha and Fjord are all right. Beau, the
rocking pain in your head causes your vision to go

00:21:36.385 --> 00:21:41.408
white and your muscles seize up and you are
stunned for the next round. Caleb?

00:21:41.408 --> 00:21:42.135
LIAM: 15.

00:21:42.135 --> 00:21:45.835
MATT: You just barely manage to shrug it off, no
issue. Nott?

00:21:45.835 --> 00:21:47.251
SAM: Six.

00:21:47.251 --> 00:21:52.718
MATT: As you feel the adrenaline burst into your
system and you begin to move backward, preparing

00:21:52.718 --> 00:21:58.868
your next bolt, it sears into your brain and your
scream immediately cuts to a halt as your lungs

00:21:58.868 --> 00:22:06.270
hold in place. Jester? Natural one. You as well
find yourself doubling over here, your feet

00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:10.999
pulling up towards your chest as you float and
drift to the side, clutching yourself. Caduceus?

00:22:10.999 --> 00:22:11.919
TALIESIN: 13.

00:22:11.919 --> 00:22:16.407
MATT: You just manage to shrug it off. It hurts
and your hands go to block it, but as soon as you

00:22:16.407 --> 00:22:24.481
shake it off, your eyes focus forward. That's
going to end its turn. That brings us to Fjord.

00:22:24.481 --> 00:22:30.488
TRAVIS: I'm going to use my 30 feet of movement
with my mariner's armor, and I'm going to move

00:22:30.488 --> 00:22:36.168
north on the map as far as I can.

00:22:36.564 --> 00:22:37.011
MATT: 30.

00:22:37.011 --> 00:22:37.851
TRAVIS: Great.

00:22:37.851 --> 00:22:41.797
MATT: You guys can swim, so there is an up and
down if you need it.

00:22:41.797 --> 00:22:49.832
TRAVIS: I will, with my bonus action-- I'll keep
it for now. I don't know what else is in there

00:22:49.832 --> 00:22:53.681
yet. I'm going to fire off two Eldritch Blasts at
his bitch ass.

00:22:53.681 --> 00:22:55.301
MATT: Go for it.

00:22:56.311 --> 00:22:58.111
TRAVIS: That's a 12. Probably won't hit.

00:22:58.112 --> 00:22:59.560
MATT: 12 does not hit.

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:01.244
TRAVIS: Damn. And a 15.

00:23:01.244 --> 00:23:02.244
MATT: 15 does hit.

00:23:02.244 --> 00:23:03.629
TRAVIS: Ooh, thank god for that.

00:23:03.629 --> 00:23:07.317
MATT: The first one, it sees you move and you see
its brow furrow, realizing that you weren't

00:23:07.317 --> 00:23:10.990
impacted by the scream. The first one, it ducks
out of the way. It spins around and you catch it

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:12.490
with the second hit.

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:16.109
TRAVIS: Ten points of Eldritch Blast damage.

00:23:16.109 --> 00:23:20.105
MATT: You got it. Fjord, that ends your go.
Jester, you are stunned.

00:23:20.105 --> 00:23:21.177
LAURA: I am.

00:23:21.177 --> 00:23:27.675
MATT: But you will have your next turn. It only
lasts until the end of its next turn. As you sit

00:23:27.675 --> 00:23:32.815
there, grasping at your head, you can taste iron
in your mouth mingling with the ocean.

00:23:32.815 --> 00:23:35.210
LAURA: I bit my tongue.

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:37.793
MATT: That brings us to Caduceus.

00:23:37.793 --> 00:23:48.654
TALIESIN: Wow, I see how this is going. I'm going
to cast Bless and hit Caleb, Nott, and Jester.

00:23:48.654 --> 00:23:52.109
MATT: Okay, so all you guys have Bless. Now you
have dual Bless, most of the party. This is

00:23:52.109 --> 00:23:53.880
actually a pretty good combo.

00:23:53.881 --> 00:24:00.989
TALIESIN: So I'm Blessing that, and then I'm going
to move out of the way. I'm going to go around

00:24:00.989 --> 00:24:06.131
that rock and over to the side there. Yeah,
anywhere I can get over there, get a little bit of distance.

00:24:06.131 --> 00:24:06.817
MATT: Along the ground?

00:24:06.817 --> 00:24:10.449
TALIESIN: Yeah, probably go up a little bit. I
want to be able to keep an eye on things.

00:24:10.449 --> 00:24:20.714
MATT: That'd put you at about there. All right,
that ends Caduceus' go. At this point, you hear

00:24:20.714 --> 00:24:27.101
this scratching sound, skittering. The doorway
that was right there, you watch something claw and

00:24:27.102 --> 00:24:33.025
tries to pull through and then shoves into it. The
stone around the entrance breaks open and the

00:24:33.025 --> 00:24:36.749
entryway opens slightly as, bursting forth--

00:24:37.004 --> 00:24:38.035
SAM: Oh god, what is that?

00:24:38.036 --> 00:24:39.051
LAURA: Oh god, oh jeez!

00:24:39.051 --> 00:24:41.658
MATT: One of the creatures from the inside that
you had seen before.

00:24:41.658 --> 00:24:45.046
TRAVIS: What is that? What the hell is that?!

00:24:45.047 --> 00:24:51.365
MATT: You saw a glimmering hint of it, looking
below, but you see this large crustacean-like

00:24:51.365 --> 00:24:59.982
entity that has heavy pincer claws. Its face
descends into tendrils, these tiny little

00:24:59.982 --> 00:25:05.789
tentacles that writhe and curl under its mouth. It
has a pair of four legs, very arachnid-like, that

00:25:05.789 --> 00:25:11.004
scurry across the ground. Another one skitters up
to the top.

00:25:11.004 --> 00:25:13.291
LAURA: Oh god!

00:25:13.291 --> 00:25:15.879
TRAVIS: Oh jesus.

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:17.981
MATT: And another one from the inside.

00:25:17.981 --> 00:25:20.762
TALIESIN: No, not cool!

00:25:20.762 --> 00:25:23.483
LAURA: No! How did they get all the way up? Can
they climb walls?

00:25:23.483 --> 00:25:24.772
MATT: They can swim, too.

00:25:24.772 --> 00:25:29.379
LAURA: They can swim?! What were we thinking?!

00:25:29.379 --> 00:25:34.160
MATT: The one that's next to Beau is going to take
two strikes at you with its pincers.

00:25:34.161 --> 00:25:35.388
BEAU: I'm stunned.

00:25:35.388 --> 00:25:37.204
MATT: You are, so that's advantage.

00:25:37.204 --> 00:25:38.551
SAM: Is that an auto-crit?

00:25:38.551 --> 00:25:46.889
MATT: No, stunned is not paralyzed. Paralyzed is
different than that; that's a Hold Person thing.

00:25:46.889 --> 00:25:56.623
That is a 24 to hit. You take from the impact on
that one dual sixes on two d6. That's 16 points of

00:25:56.624 --> 00:26:06.120
bludgeoning damage, and you are grappled. The
other attack is going to be 18 to hit.

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:09.468
MARISHA: Miss.

00:26:09.469 --> 00:26:10.989
MATT: Miss?

00:26:10.989 --> 00:26:13.492
MARISHA: Yep, my armor class is 19. Bracers!

00:26:13.492 --> 00:26:17.798
MATT: As you pull back, even though you're
stunned, it grapples you with one hand and goes to

00:26:17.798 --> 00:26:21.556
try and grab you with the other and you just
manage, while still stunned, to pull just out of

00:26:21.556 --> 00:26:25.624
its grasp. However, you are grappled, so it's
going to use its tentacle attack on you as well.

00:26:25.624 --> 00:26:30.202
You need to make a constitution saving throw.

00:26:30.202 --> 00:26:33.316
TRAVIS: If we hit it, do you think it might break
the grapple?

00:26:33.316 --> 00:26:36.950
MATT: Usually you have to try and pull somebody
out of a grapple or push it away from them.

00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:40.867
LAURA: But she's in claws. She's grappled in
claws.

00:26:41.448 --> 00:26:48.672
MARISHA: Oh, thank you, Gil! 21 plus a four from
Bless, so 25.

00:26:48.672 --> 00:26:53.338
MATT: As it pulls you in with its grappled claws,
tentacles begin to reach towards your shoulders

00:26:53.338 --> 00:26:57.057
and neck and, like a jellyfish, you feel the sting
hit you, but you manage to just writhe enough away

00:26:57.057 --> 00:27:01.440
and whatever toxin that is trying to release and
pour into your system doesn't actually find

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:03.190
purchase within your internal body.

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:06.143
MARISHA: Ugh, no, I'm not into that, no!

00:27:06.143 --> 00:27:12.531
MATT: That's their turn. That brings us to Yasha.

00:27:12.531 --> 00:27:22.105
TRAVIS: Yasha will advance on &lt;i&gt;el&lt;/i&gt; aqua screecher
gentleman, and she will unleash two swipes with

00:27:22.105 --> 00:27:28.076
the Magician's Judge. With her bonus action she
would like to rage.

00:27:28.076 --> 00:27:29.900
MATT: There you go, good memory.

00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:32.069
TALIESIN: A d4 attached to each attack roll.

00:27:32.069 --> 00:27:37.993
TRAVIS: Because of Bless. 18 to hit?

00:27:37.993 --> 00:27:39.437
MATT: 18 hits.

00:27:39.438 --> 00:27:44.711
TRAVIS: First one hits and the second one, 19?

00:27:44.711 --> 00:27:47.837
MATT: Also hits. Both attacks hit.

00:27:47.837 --> 00:28:03.482
TRAVIS: The third one is 3d6. 15 points on the
first one. On the second one-- that's not great.

00:28:04.697 --> 00:28:07.761
Eight points on the second one of slashing damage.

00:28:07.761 --> 00:28:09.404
MATT: All right. As she swings through--

00:28:09.404 --> 00:28:13.147
TRAVIS: Sorry, ten points. Add two more on that.

00:28:18.763 --> 00:28:23.419
MATT: As Yasha moves forward, sword swinging,
and-- oh, both of those attacks technically have

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:25.028
disadvantage, because you're underwater.

00:28:25.028 --> 00:28:25.841
TRAVIS: They do.

00:28:25.841 --> 00:28:27.963
MATT: So roll once for each again, just to see.

00:28:27.963 --> 00:28:30.324
MARISHA: Is that all of us?

00:28:30.324 --> 00:28:33.133
MATT: Actually, are you affected by it with your
mariner's armor?

00:28:33.133 --> 00:28:35.199
TRAVIS: I'm not, but she is.

00:28:35.199 --> 00:28:36.480
MATT: She is, that's right.

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:41.675
TRAVIS: Yeah. That is a 19 for the first one.

00:28:41.675 --> 00:28:42.726
MATT: Yep, still hits.

00:28:42.726 --> 00:28:44.426
TRAVIS: Second one, that's a natural 19.

00:28:44.426 --> 00:28:48.629
MATT: Yeah, already cool, she's fine. Sword, while
still resistant against the water, manages to

00:28:48.629 --> 00:28:52.895
strike twice and carving into this creature, who
had already taken the blasts from the other

00:28:52.895 --> 00:28:56.093
members of your party. The blood around it begins
to fill the area with this dark

00:28:56.093 --> 00:28:59.863
blue-purple-crimson coloring. That finishes
Yasha's turn?

00:28:59.863 --> 00:29:00.515
TRAVIS: It does.

00:29:00.515 --> 00:29:02.498
MATT: All right, bringing us to the top. Beau and
Nott, you're up.

00:29:02.498 --> 00:29:05.489
SAM: We're stunned, right?

00:29:05.489 --> 00:29:07.433
MARISHA: Are we done being stunned?

00:29:07.433 --> 00:29:08.550
MATT: Nope. You will be soon.

00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:09.659
SAM: This is the round.

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:12.390
MATT: That's your turn. You're no longer stunned.
Bringing us to Caleb.

00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:17.988
LIAM: I'm going to move half my movement, so is
that three?

00:29:17.988 --> 00:29:19.553
MATT: Three, correct.

00:29:19.553 --> 00:29:25.494
LIAM: I'm going to go one, two, three to here and
fire off Magic Missiles at this one by Yasha at a

00:29:25.494 --> 00:29:26.688
level two.

00:29:26.689 --> 00:29:27.861
MATT: All right, four missiles.

00:29:31.026 --> 00:29:36.092
LIAM: All terrible rolls. It's eight points of
damage.

00:29:36.092 --> 00:29:38.289
MATT: Eight points of damage total?

00:29:38.289 --> 00:29:39.786
LIAM: Yeah, that's it.

00:29:39.786 --> 00:29:41.811
SAM: Plus anything to it?

00:29:41.811 --> 00:29:43.889
LIAM: Yes, I do, plus 12 points of damage.

00:29:43.889 --> 00:29:47.929
MATT: 12 points of damage. As it's taking the
blasts from all of them, carved through by Yasha,

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:54.019
it starts trying to back away as the missiles
through the water, carving these little paths of

00:29:54.019 --> 00:30:01.182
bubbles behind them, slamming into each side. It
drifts there, lifeless, in the water next to Yasha.

00:30:01.514 --> 00:30:02.930
MARISHA: You killed him!

00:30:02.931 --> 00:30:04.042
SAM: Oh, wow!

00:30:04.042 --> 00:30:05.121
TALIESIN: One down.

00:30:05.122 --> 00:30:13.101
MATT: That ends Caleb's turn. It's your movement
and action, correct?

00:30:13.101 --> 00:30:14.158
LIAM: Yep.

00:30:14.158 --> 00:30:19.261
MATT: Holding on to your haste. It is now that
creature's turn, but it's dead. Fjord, you're up.

00:30:19.261 --> 00:30:21.231
TRAVIS: Oh, shit, it's already me?

00:30:21.231 --> 00:30:21.884
MATT: Yeah.

00:30:21.884 --> 00:30:26.911
TRAVIS: Ah! Yeah, I know.

00:30:26.911 --> 00:30:28.631
MARISHA: It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

00:30:29.615 --> 00:30:33.759
TRAVIS: Yeah. I don't know if I want to get that
close to it. That thing is grappling-crazy. Can I

00:30:33.759 --> 00:30:41.724
kick up 15 feet and back 15?

00:30:41.724 --> 00:30:45.754
MATT: Sure. Back this way? This way?

00:30:45.755 --> 00:30:48.653
TRAVIS: Away from the target.

00:30:48.653 --> 00:30:50.017
MATT: That'll put you right up there.

00:30:50.017 --> 00:30:51.304
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll take it.

00:30:51.304 --> 00:30:53.645
MATT: You boof up in the air around it.

00:30:53.645 --> 00:30:56.808
TRAVIS: I will again throw two Eldritch Blasts.

00:30:56.808 --> 00:30:58.489
MATT: Go for it.

00:30:58.489 --> 00:31:01.119
TRAVIS: That's a natural 19 and--

00:31:01.119 --> 00:31:02.944
MATT: Against which one?

00:31:02.944 --> 00:31:04.995
TRAVIS: The guy on the lower.

00:31:04.996 --> 00:31:06.740
MATT: All right, got you.

00:31:07.061 --> 00:31:12.302
TRAVIS: Natural 19 is 26 to hit on the first one,
and the second one is a 19?

00:31:12.302 --> 00:31:13.264
MATT: Both hit.

00:31:13.264 --> 00:31:23.176
TRAVIS: Okay, great. Lots of dice for two
different characters. Nine plus five, 14 on the

00:31:23.176 --> 00:31:29.236
first one and 13 on the second one. Nice! Those
are good.

00:31:29.237 --> 00:31:30.856
MATT: You got it.

00:31:30.856 --> 00:31:39.185
TRAVIS: With my bonus action, I will do nothing
yet.

00:31:39.185 --> 00:31:44.615
MATT: Okay, that ends Fjord's turn. Jester and
Caduceus, you guys are up next. Both concentrating

00:31:44.615 --> 00:31:45.964
on Bless, right?

00:31:45.964 --> 00:31:47.256
TALIESIN and LAURA: Yeah.

00:31:47.257 --> 00:31:51.333
MATT: I'll mark that for the two of you as well.
What're you doing?

00:31:51.333 --> 00:32:00.750
LAURA: For my bonus action, I'm going to cast
Spiritual Weapon? I'm going to cast Spiritual Weapon!

00:32:01.191 --> 00:32:04.391
TALIESIN: We'll talk about that other thing later.

00:32:04.391 --> 00:32:05.763
LAURA: Yeah.

00:32:05.763 --> 00:32:07.982
MATT: Where would you like for it to be?

00:32:07.982 --> 00:32:09.884
LAURA: Up by these guys.

00:32:09.884 --> 00:32:11.772
MATT: Okay. The range on that is 60 feet?

00:32:11.772 --> 00:32:14.768
LIAM: Yeah. With Spiritual Weapon, yeah.

00:32:14.768 --> 00:32:17.032
MATT: Yeah, so you can definitely get it. You want
it on this edge?

00:32:17.032 --> 00:32:24.659
LAURA: Sweet! Right in between them, and it's
going to attack the one that is close to the wall.

00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:27.477
MATT: All right, go for it. Take it strike.

00:32:27.477 --> 00:32:32.114
SAM: (singing) Lollipop, lollipop, oh
lolly-lollipop.

00:32:32.114 --> 00:32:33.972
TRAVIS and MATT: Ba-boom boom boom.

00:32:33.972 --> 00:32:37.213
LAURA: What do I add? Anything?

00:32:37.213 --> 00:32:39.116
SAM: Spell melee.

00:32:39.116 --> 00:32:41.555
LAURA: Why do I forget how to play?

00:32:41.555 --> 00:32:42.764
TALIESIN: It's been a few weeks.

00:32:42.764 --> 00:32:44.684
MATT: It's been a few weeks. Add your spell--

00:32:44.684 --> 00:32:45.750
LAURA: My wisdom?

00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:50.026
MATT: Your spell attack modifier, which is your
proficiency bonus plus your wisdom modifier.

00:32:50.026 --> 00:32:54.538
LAURA: Spell attack!

00:32:54.538 --> 00:32:56.060
MATT: The difference three weeks can make.

00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:57.411
LAURA: So 15.

00:32:57.411 --> 00:33:00.840
MATT: That hits. No, it doesn't! It just misses.
Oh, shit, sorry.

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:03.303
TALIESIN: Oh, wait, it's an attack, you get an
extra d4.

00:33:03.304 --> 00:33:05.656
MATT: You do. You're blessed by Caduceus. Oh, you
did?

00:33:05.656 --> 00:33:07.028
TALIESIN: Oh, you did roll your d4, never mind.

00:33:07.028 --> 00:33:08.295
LAURA: I did it already.

00:33:08.295 --> 00:33:14.524
MATT: I'm sorry. It swings through. It manages to
hit the side of its body and then scrape off of

00:33:14.524 --> 00:33:17.110
its hard, armored exterior.

00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:20.591
LAURA: That's okay, I'm going to cast Sacred Flame
at it.

00:33:20.592 --> 00:33:21.611
MATT: Same one, over here?

00:33:21.611 --> 00:33:22.135
LAURA: Yeah.

00:33:22.135 --> 00:33:23.362
MATT: Is that its dexterity?

00:33:23.362 --> 00:33:25.006
LAURA: That's his dexterity save.

00:33:25.006 --> 00:33:27.240
MATT: That is going to be a seven.

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:37.296
LAURA: Yay, it hits! Go fuck yourself, crab! Ah!
Eight plus four, 12!

00:33:37.296 --> 00:33:39.145
MATT: All righty.

00:33:39.145 --> 00:33:44.748
MARISHA: Someone hit it. Thank god.

00:33:44.748 --> 00:33:52.340
MATT: The flame bursts around and it seems to
shrug it off. That ends your turn. Going to stay

00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:53.263
where you are?

00:33:53.263 --> 00:33:53.867
LAURA: Yeah.

00:33:53.867 --> 00:33:54.963
MATT: All right. Caduceus.

00:33:54.963 --> 00:33:59.394
TALIESIN: I'm going to use my bonus action to
throw a quick Healing Word at Beau.

00:33:59.394 --> 00:34:02.234
LAURA: I'm going to actually step behind the rock.

00:34:02.234 --> 00:34:07.936
TALIESIN: That's just six hit points, sorry.

00:34:07.936 --> 00:34:11.665
LAURA: Although I like that Yasha is the rock.

00:34:11.666 --> 00:34:21.014
TALIESIN: Then I'm going to get a little bit away
from the tower. I'm going to try and stay in range

00:34:21.014 --> 00:34:23.258
of that one but circle around away from these
fuckers.

00:34:23.257 --> 00:34:24.491
MATT: Circle around this way?

00:34:24.491 --> 00:34:35.451
TALIESIN: Yeah, around like that. The one that has
Beau, I'm going to hold a Path to the Grave until

00:34:35.452 --> 00:34:41.023
Yasha attacks. I'm going to hold my thing for
Yasha to hit it.

00:34:41.023 --> 00:34:42.386
TRAVIS: So this guy down here at the bottom?

00:34:42.386 --> 00:34:43.349
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:34:43.349 --> 00:34:44.220
MATT: Holding your action for that?

00:34:44.219 --> 00:34:44.757
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:34:44.757 --> 00:34:52.855
MATT: You got it. Ending Caduceus' go, it's their
turn. This one here that has Beau grappled is

00:34:52.856 --> 00:34:58.481
going to spin around, which is going to open the
doorway. This guy here, both of them are going to

00:34:58.481 --> 00:35:05.467
leave behind this region. This guy is going to
double move. This one's going to come down and get

00:35:05.467 --> 00:35:15.969
into melee with you, but that's its turn. It moved
and dashed. This one here is going to swoop down.

00:35:15.969 --> 00:35:23.051
Same thing, move and dash, and it's going to head
towards Yasha. And then--

00:35:23.051 --> 00:35:25.163
LAURA: And then?!

00:35:25.164 --> 00:35:27.680
SAM: There's another one!

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:29.499
MATT: Another one comes through the doorway here.

00:35:29.499 --> 00:35:31.310
TRAVIS: He was just hanging out, slow-playing that
shit?

00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:32.291
MATT: Yep.

00:35:32.291 --> 00:35:33.888
TRAVIS: You son of a bitch.

00:35:33.888 --> 00:35:38.935
MATT: He is going to attempt to move past Beau.
Which, Beau, if you want to take it, even though

00:35:38.936 --> 00:35:41.671
you're grappled, you can take your attack of
opportunity to stop it or let it go.

00:35:41.671 --> 00:35:43.337
SAM: Is she still stunned, or is this out of--

00:35:43.337 --> 00:35:44.499
MARISHA: Did my stun wear off?

00:35:44.499 --> 00:35:45.341
LAURA: Yeah, the guy died.

00:35:45.342 --> 00:35:46.808
MATT: Yeah, he's dead. You're no longer stunned.

00:35:46.808 --> 00:35:48.531
MARISHA: I might as well. It would go to waste,
anyway. Right?

00:35:48.531 --> 00:35:53.341
MATT: Up to you. You're grappling. You see him
running by.

00:35:53.341 --> 00:35:56.527
TRAVIS: I don't like his face the way he said it.
He's going to turn on you. You're going to have

00:35:56.527 --> 00:35:58.004
two on you.

00:35:58.004 --> 00:36:08.089
MARISHA: I'm going to have two on me? Plus seven.
24.

00:36:08.089 --> 00:36:10.140
MATT: 24 hits. Roll damage.

00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:15.565
MARISHA: Plus another four with Bless that I
didn't do. That's a regular old off-hand attack, right?

00:36:16.057 --> 00:36:19.075
LIAM: Is everyone attacking at disadvantage like
Yasha was?

00:36:19.075 --> 00:36:22.067
MATT: You should be. You have to roll one more
time.

00:36:22.067 --> 00:36:27.949
MARISHA: I think I'm still good. Six damage.

00:36:27.949 --> 00:36:34.458
MATT: Six points of damage. You got it. We have
two of them who dashed down, swimming through the

00:36:34.458 --> 00:36:42.148
water, curling through the water, and then two
stuck on Beauregard. You are grappled by the first

00:36:42.148 --> 00:36:46.914
one. It's going to make two pincer attacks and
tentacles against you.

00:36:46.914 --> 00:36:51.556
LAURA: (singing) I am stuck on Beauregard, 'cause
Beau is stuck on me.

00:36:52.721 --> 00:36:57.860
MATT: Natural four and a natural two. It's going
to be a ten and an eight, so you're still

00:36:57.860 --> 00:37:03.308
grappled. He's still holding you, but can't quite
squeeze onto-- the other one can't snap at you.

00:37:03.308 --> 00:37:06.675
Make another constitution saving throw for me,
please.

00:37:06.675 --> 00:37:10.809
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Plus a d4.

00:37:10.809 --> 00:37:12.932
TALIESIN: I love Bless, man.

00:37:12.932 --> 00:37:16.703
MARISHA: Plus another three, so 17.

00:37:16.703 --> 00:37:22.030
MATT: The tentacles (slurping) towards you, and
you dodge out of the way, keeping it at bay. It's

00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:26.819
barely touching the edge of your neck as you're
trying to shove it. The other guy swings around

00:37:26.819 --> 00:37:32.988
after being impacted by you and begins to make two
pincer attacks against you as well.

00:37:32.988 --> 00:37:35.258
TRAVIS: Natural three and natural five.

00:37:35.258 --> 00:37:41.006
MATT: Natural 20 and natural 19. Not even joking.
I'm pretty sure that hits you.

00:37:41.006 --> 00:37:43.593
MARISHA: Both times.

00:37:43.593 --> 00:37:48.060
LAURA: Are you going to do something, Cad? Cad, do
something!

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:53.000
TALIESIN: I'm not 30 feet away from that, am I?

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.149
MATT: No.

00:37:55.149 --> 00:37:57.476
TALIESIN: Damn it. Okay, never mind.

00:37:57.476 --> 00:38:07.280
MATT: For the non-crit, that is going to be 13
points of bludgeoning damage. Crit is going to be

00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:11.093
22 points of bludgeoning damage.

00:38:12.771 --> 00:38:13.783
MARISHA: 22?

00:38:13.783 --> 00:38:25.359
MATT: Correct. I need you to make a constitution
saving throw. You managed to dodge away from the

00:38:25.359 --> 00:38:29.953
first one, barely noticing the other one come up
from behind clasp on and then grapple you. You're

00:38:29.954 --> 00:38:33.182
now grappled by each of them. One of them has you
by the torso, the other by the legs, and they're

00:38:33.182 --> 00:38:36.888
almost pulling you in half. As it gets another
claw into the side and it reaches in, its

00:38:36.889 --> 00:38:40.215
tentacles begin reaching toward your shoulders.
What'd you roll?

00:38:40.215 --> 00:38:41.511
MARISHA: 14.

00:38:41.511 --> 00:38:43.141
TALIESIN: Is that with the d4?

00:38:43.141 --> 00:38:47.452
MATT: That's okay, you manage to resist the
toxins. You manage to push them back and forth.

00:38:47.452 --> 00:38:52.352
Both of their heads are pulling towards you. It's
closing in your space. All you see is a smattering

00:38:52.352 --> 00:39:01.481
of claws, angry alien faces, and red filling the
water around you, your own. That finishes their

00:39:01.481 --> 00:39:03.587
turn. Yasha's up.

00:39:04.046 --> 00:39:10.209
TRAVIS: Right. Yeah, she is going to deal with
the-- what are these called? We don't know.

00:39:10.209 --> 00:39:11.169
MATT: You don't know.

00:39:11.169 --> 00:39:13.065
TALIESIN: I see her attacking and I'm--

00:39:13.065 --> 00:39:21.275
TRAVIS: She's going to deal with Carl right in
front of her. Reckless against these sons of bitches.

00:39:21.485 --> 00:39:22.962
MATT: You got it. Straight attack on these.

00:39:22.962 --> 00:39:30.444
TRAVIS: Straight attack. Okay. Sorry, here I go.
18 to hit.

00:39:30.444 --> 00:39:31.527
MATT: 18 hits.

00:39:31.527 --> 00:39:36.169
TRAVIS: Okay, and the second one I'll get out of
the way. That's a 22, that hits. 23.

00:39:36.169 --> 00:39:40.285
MATT: Roll damage for the first attack, which is
doubled because the creature's vulnerable because

00:39:40.285 --> 00:39:45.058
of Caduceus. Seeing Yasha strike towards it,
focuses divine energy and makes it briefly

00:39:45.059 --> 00:39:46.883
vulnerable to the strike.

00:39:46.883 --> 00:39:48.421
TRAVIS: All damage is doubled on the first one?

00:39:48.421 --> 00:39:49.124
MATT: Yep.

00:39:49.124 --> 00:40:01.165
TRAVIS: It's 3d6, so that's (counting) 17. What's
17 times two?

00:40:01.166 --> 00:40:04.092
MATT: 34 points of slashing damage against the
first guy.

00:40:04.092 --> 00:40:06.368
TRAVIS: Second one.

00:40:06.368 --> 00:40:07.037
LAURA: Was that Yasha?

00:40:07.037 --> 00:40:12.839
TRAVIS: Yeah. Five, seven, plus three is ten. 12
points of slashing damage for the second one.

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:20.045
MATT: As it swims down and lands, Yasha carves
into it. With each strike, part of its

00:40:20.045 --> 00:40:26.348
under-bellied shell cracks open slightly, and bits
of dull, grayish-black liquid begin to fill the

00:40:26.348 --> 00:40:30.859
area around it. Its head streaks back, and its
tentacles go wild, and you can see from the inside

00:40:30.859 --> 00:40:37.725
a strange series of clear tendrils that come out
of an interior mouth. There's a brief moment of

00:40:37.725 --> 00:40:43.373
this really creepy, alien physicality, but Yasha
is focused and raging and swinging the blade as

00:40:43.373 --> 00:40:46.840
hard as she can. Ending her turn, bringing us to
he top of the round. Beau and Nott, you guys are up.

00:40:48.633 --> 00:40:55.607
SAM: I'll go first. I don't know how powerful they
are, but I don't think I can kill one on one shot.

00:40:55.607 --> 00:40:59.216
We got to get you out of this grapple.

00:40:59.216 --> 00:41:02.266
MARISHA: So sorry. I'm so sorry.

00:41:02.266 --> 00:41:03.873
LIAM: It's okay. It's just my teeth.

00:41:03.873 --> 00:41:05.073
MATT: Oh, buddy.

00:41:05.073 --> 00:41:14.458
SAM: Oh, no. He's had the worst luck. I think,
seeing the predicament that Beau is in, I'm going

00:41:14.458 --> 00:41:20.299
to cast Phantasmal Force against one of the ones
that is grappling her.

00:41:20.299 --> 00:41:29.839
MATT: Okay. Let's see here. It's an intelligence
saving throw. They are not intelligent.

00:41:29.839 --> 00:41:31.395
SAM: I assumed.

00:41:31.396 --> 00:41:35.544
MATT: That is cocked. That is a 12 minus three.
Nine.

00:41:35.544 --> 00:41:37.413
SAM: Good, so they fail.

00:41:37.413 --> 00:41:40.767
MATT: Which one of these, and what do you create?

00:41:40.767 --> 00:41:47.513
SAM: It doesn't much matter. I want one of them to
drop her grapple. I'm going to do the one closer

00:41:47.514 --> 00:42:01.076
to me, and the image that they see and feel is
that of a tiny goblin girl jumping on its face and

00:42:01.076 --> 00:42:04.172
biting it in the eye. I can roll for damage.

00:42:04.172 --> 00:42:05.099
MATT: Yes, you can.

00:42:05.099 --> 00:42:12.619
SAM: They suffer three points of damage, and they
have a goblin on their face, covering their eye.

00:42:12.619 --> 00:42:14.198
TRAVIS: Both of them, or just one?

00:42:14.198 --> 00:42:16.363
SAM: Just the one creature.

00:42:16.363 --> 00:42:22.993
MATT: We'll get to what it does on its turn, but
yeah. As soon as you complete the spell, its head

00:42:22.994 --> 00:42:26.809
suddenly jerks back, twice, three times. You get
the sense it's had effect.

00:42:26.809 --> 00:42:35.329
SAM: Because I'm hasted, do I get a second attack?
Okay, I will now attack the other one with my

00:42:35.329 --> 00:42:42.915
Tinkertop Boltblaster. Oh wait, do I get to add a
plus four?

00:42:42.915 --> 00:42:44.561
MATT: You are blessed, I believe, right?

00:42:44.561 --> 00:42:53.588
SAM: Yeah. One, okay. That's something. 17 to
hit.

00:42:53.588 --> 00:42:55.086
MATT: 17 hits.

00:42:55.086 --> 00:42:57.087
SAM: Okay, and sneak attack?

00:42:57.088 --> 00:42:58.988
MATT: Yeah, because it's adjacent to Beau.

00:43:03.087 --> 00:43:04.999
SAM: 26 points of damage.

00:43:04.999 --> 00:43:06.216
MATT: Is this the same one that has Phantasmal
Force?

00:43:06.217 --> 00:43:07.290
SAM: No.

00:43:07.290 --> 00:43:09.637
MATT: The other one. How much was that? That
was--

00:43:09.637 --> 00:43:16.700
SAM: 26 points of damage. I'll do Fury of the
Small. That's an extra seven-- what are we at now?

00:43:16.972 --> 00:43:21.793
MATT: Yeah, an extra seven. 33 points of damage in
one strike. The other one that's holding onto

00:43:21.793 --> 00:43:28.968
Beau-- she's still being pulled apart from the two
different claws. She's about to be bishopped. The

00:43:28.968 --> 00:43:31.518
secondary one, as it's not freaking out, its
tendrils are trying to reach around her face.

00:43:31.518 --> 00:43:38.205
Suddenly the side of the bolt jams into where you
imagine an ocular socket would be in a normal

00:43:38.205 --> 00:43:41.991
creature. As it impacts, the head jerks back.
Little bit of cloud of blood pools off of it, and

00:43:41.992 --> 00:43:44.776
it looks over in your direction.

00:43:45.162 --> 00:43:51.785
SAM: Then I will very conspicuously, bonus action,
fire again. That's 26 to hit.

00:43:51.785 --> 00:43:54.964
MATT: That hits. Rogues, man.

00:43:54.965 --> 00:43:56.714
SAM: Plus another ten points of damage.

00:43:56.714 --> 00:44:02.000
MATT: Nice. A second bolt hits it. It looks back
in your direction with a second bolt. Now there's

00:44:02.001 --> 00:44:06.202
two of them sticking out the side of its face. Two
of the tentacles curl up around them, wrapping

00:44:06.202 --> 00:44:10.556
onto whatever purchase it finds on its face,
trying to pull it out. That ends your turn? You

00:44:10.556 --> 00:44:11.205
want to move?

00:44:11.205 --> 00:44:16.659
SAM: I'll move into the bushes there. I know I
can't hide, but towards the tower.

00:44:16.659 --> 00:44:23.552
MATT: You move in, ducking into the mix there.
Perfect. That ends your turn. Caleb, you're up.

00:44:23.552 --> 00:44:25.147
MARISHA: I haven't gone.

00:44:25.147 --> 00:44:26.613
MATT: Oh, that's right. Beau.

00:44:26.613 --> 00:44:28.254
MARISHA: I'm still grappled by both of them,
though.

00:44:28.254 --> 00:44:31.134
MATT: You are. You cannot move unless you break
the grapple. It's an action to attempt to escape.

00:44:31.135 --> 00:44:32.375
TRAVIS: Are you grappled by both?

00:44:32.375 --> 00:44:35.834
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

00:44:37.198 --> 00:44:40.473
MATT: A successful grapple attempt would be
against both of them, but they'd both get to roll

00:44:40.474 --> 00:44:45.190
to try and keep you grappled. It's only one action
to try and break from both, if you wanted to break

00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:46.537
free. Up to you.

00:44:46.537 --> 00:44:48.381
MARISHA: That sounds like a waste of Beau's time.

00:44:48.381 --> 00:44:50.002
MATT: Fair enough. Respect that.

00:44:50.002 --> 00:44:59.676
MARISHA: She is holding on, going to start
swinging wildly from where she is. She's going to

00:44:59.676 --> 00:45:01.473
hit the--

00:45:01.474 --> 00:45:02.764
TRAVIS: Smoke bombs. Something.

00:45:02.764 --> 00:45:07.288
MARISHA: Smoke bombs don't affect their grip.

00:45:07.288 --> 00:45:09.330
LIAM: And we're underwater.

00:45:10.516 --> 00:45:19.101
MARISHA: The one that got Phantasmaled. Okay, plus
seven, Jesus. 23.

00:45:19.101 --> 00:45:21.711
MATT: 23 hits. It's with disadvantage, right?

00:45:21.711 --> 00:45:22.901
MARISHA: No.

00:45:22.901 --> 00:45:25.094
MATT: Roll with disadvantage on these attacks.

00:45:25.094 --> 00:45:27.158
LAURA: Add four. No?

00:45:27.158 --> 00:45:30.065
MARISHA: It's a one.

00:45:30.065 --> 00:45:35.127
MATT: First swing snaps onto its armor. Your
knuckles crack in the instance, and you feel a

00:45:35.127 --> 00:45:38.132
sharp pain through your wrist. Make your next
attack.

00:45:39.175 --> 00:45:46.113
MARISHA: What else can I do? Is there anything
else I can fucking do here? Okay.

00:45:46.113 --> 00:45:50.486
SAM: Patient Defense, whatever that is?

00:45:50.486 --> 00:46:03.103
MARISHA: I mean, I can do it on my-- but I still
get a second attack here. Okay, 18 plus one, 19.

00:46:03.103 --> 00:46:05.582
MATT: 19 hits. Roll damage.

00:46:06.033 --> 00:46:12.086
MARISHA: Same one. That's good. Nine damage. I'm
going to spend a ki point to do Stunning Strike,

00:46:12.086 --> 00:46:13.913
for the love of god.

00:46:14.894 --> 00:46:18.794
MATT: Constitution saving throw. It's a plus
three, but it's a natural four. Seven.

00:46:18.794 --> 00:46:20.181
MARISHA: Stunned.

00:46:20.181 --> 00:46:23.067
TRAVIS: That helps a ton.

00:46:23.067 --> 00:46:31.430
MATT: It drops the grapple. The grip that it has
on you laxes as suddenly the area where you

00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:35.473
managed to jam the fist, right underneath the jaw,
causes part of its throat to collapse inward, and

00:46:35.473 --> 00:46:40.150
it's at the moment not sure where it is. You feel
that one release. The other one still has you,

00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:42.463
though. That's your action. You still have your
bonus.

00:46:42.463 --> 00:46:49.975
MARISHA: I'm going to do my bonus. Does Patient
Defense matter if I'm grappled?

00:46:49.975 --> 00:46:55.180
MATT: Yeah. All grapple does is lower your speed
to zero. You can't move. Restrained is what really

00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:57.471
fucks you up because that gives advantage on
attacks against you.

00:46:57.472 --> 00:47:02.504
MARISHA: Okay. Copy. Yeah, I'll do Patient
Defense. I'll look at the other one and grab his

00:47:02.504 --> 00:47:06.142
claws and stare him in the eye.

00:47:06.142 --> 00:47:12.712
MATT: Where its eyes would be, you imagine. Trying
to look for an eye to glare at. Perfect. That ends

00:47:12.713 --> 00:47:15.280
your turn, Beau. Caleb, you're up.

00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:19.955
LIAM: I was backing away from the action, but
seeing how the things are turning south, I start

00:47:19.955 --> 00:47:25.538
pushing back towards Miss Lionett through the
water. I make it that far, and I'm going to cast

00:47:25.538 --> 00:47:30.795
Magic Missile at level four.

00:47:30.795 --> 00:47:32.813
MATT: 4th-level Magic Missile!

00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:40.729
LIAM: (counting) 22.

00:47:40.729 --> 00:47:46.734
MATT: 22 points of damage against which one?

00:47:46.735 --> 00:47:55.393
LIAM: The one that's backside is to me. This side.
No, the one on Beauregard here.

00:47:55.393 --> 00:48:07.669
MATT: You got it. Perfect. 22 points of damage on
that. Each one impacts. The shell darkens from the

00:48:07.669 --> 00:48:16.600
blasts as all six bolts-- you full-on
Robotech-style missile into the sides of it.

00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:21.647
There's a series of small, dull explosion sounds
in the nearby water before it goes still. It's

00:48:21.647 --> 00:48:25.380
still moving and shifting around, but its head is
thrashing about wildly, seemingly distracted by

00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:27.329
something you can't see.

00:48:29.138 --> 00:48:31.235
LIAM: That's the end of my turn.

00:48:31.235 --> 00:48:41.508
MATT: Now it's their go. The one that is still
holding Beau releases her and begins scrabbling

00:48:41.508 --> 00:48:54.598
towards its face. It manages to strike out and
clasp nothing. Natural 20. Critical hit on nothing

00:48:54.598 --> 00:48:58.022
as it's striking out in the direction of its face,
trying to clear this little goblin off of its

00:48:58.192 --> 00:49:06.034
visual cortex, its tentacles reaching out to
nothing. It moves and shifts this way to try and

00:49:06.034 --> 00:49:11.837
scrape and get off. It's going to wreck it there.
Does it get to make a saving throw at the end of

00:49:11.837 --> 00:49:12.786
each of its turn?

00:49:12.786 --> 00:49:13.953
MARISHA: Does it move out of my range?

00:49:13.953 --> 00:49:26.755
SAM: Let me look. Each round on your turn, I can
deal damage. My god, this is a long-ass spell.

00:49:26.755 --> 00:49:33.447
MATT: It does. It doesn't get to save every turn,
it looks like, but it lasts for a minute. You can

00:49:33.447 --> 00:49:39.665
continue to do damage to it. It thinks it's real,
but it's starting to wonder as it's done a few

00:49:39.735 --> 00:49:43.504
hits that should have snatched this thing up. It's
finding no purchase, so you get the sense that

00:49:43.504 --> 00:49:48.400
maybe the illusion is starting to-- you've gotten
a round of distraction from it. I'll put it that way.

00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:51.581
SAM: "While the target is affected, the spell
treats the phantasm as if it's real. The target

00:49:51.581 --> 00:49:57.203
"rationalizes any illogical outcomes from
interacting with the phantasm."

00:49:57.203 --> 00:49:58.731
MATT: So it's just a quick little goblin.

00:49:58.731 --> 00:50:03.395
(laughter)

00:50:03.613 --> 00:50:07.424
TRAVIS: I love that they wrote it out that
specifically.

00:50:07.425 --> 00:50:18.434
MATT: Yeah. Interesting, so it's more frustrated
that it's taking damage from this little creature,

00:50:18.434 --> 00:50:24.686
but the damage is negligible. It's now like, "Fuck
it."

00:50:24.686 --> 00:50:27.582
SAM: Got it. That makes sense. I buy that.

00:50:27.582 --> 00:50:29.109
MATT: This is me rationalizing its
rationalization.

00:50:29.109 --> 00:50:31.098
SAM: Yeah, no, that makes sense.

00:50:31.098 --> 00:50:33.456
MATT: You manage to get her free of the grapple.

00:50:33.456 --> 00:50:35.084
MARISHA: Did he hop out of my melee range?

00:50:35.084 --> 00:50:36.364
MATT: He did.

00:50:36.364 --> 00:50:38.722
MARISHA: Pop, pop. Sentinel.

00:50:38.722 --> 00:50:40.024
MATT: Go for it.

00:50:40.024 --> 00:50:42.154
TRAVIS: Is that going to turn him back around on
you?

00:50:42.155 --> 00:50:46.675
MARISHA: Well, natural one doesn't-- and a natural
20!

00:50:46.675 --> 00:50:48.746
SAM: Then this is the one that misses, right?

00:50:48.746 --> 00:50:52.590
MARISHA: No, I rolled a natural one.

00:50:52.590 --> 00:50:56.305
MATT: Oh, you rolled a natural one?

00:50:56.305 --> 00:50:59.884
MARISHA: Yeah, I rolled a nat one and a nat 20, so
he moves.

00:50:59.885 --> 00:51:02.866
MATT: He does move. It's fine.

00:51:02.866 --> 00:51:08.802
TRAVIS: That's okay. I think that's actually
better. Keep him going.

00:51:08.802 --> 00:51:13.815
MATT and TALIESIN: This is fine.

00:51:13.815 --> 00:51:24.133
MATT: That one shoots past that one here towards
Caduceus. Actually, I looked at the wrong order.

00:51:24.133 --> 00:51:30.134
There's a few more turns before they get a chance
to go. We'll say that happened if it gets to it.

00:51:30.134 --> 00:51:34.682
That was actually the initiative for the creature
that you've already killed. Fjord, you're up.

00:51:34.682 --> 00:51:42.187
TRAVIS: Fjord will take all 30 of his speed and
head towards the two lumberfucks that're messing

00:51:42.187 --> 00:51:44.183
with Beau.

00:51:45.302 --> 00:51:46.863
MATT: Same height, or are you lowering yourself?

00:51:46.863 --> 00:51:48.826
TRAVIS: I'd like to get down there, if I can.

00:51:48.826 --> 00:51:53.188
MATT: You can get into melee, I'll say, with this
one. Technically both of them, you can get to both

00:51:53.188 --> 00:51:54.048
of them.

00:51:54.048 --> 00:52:00.207
TRAVIS: Could I? I'm going to send-- and one of
them's stunned, right?

00:52:00.207 --> 00:52:02.163
MATT: It is, yes.

00:52:02.163 --> 00:52:10.867
TRAVIS: I'm going to take two swings with the
Summer's Dance falchion at the stunned one that

00:52:10.867 --> 00:52:13.080
just let go of Beau.

00:52:13.309 --> 00:52:17.755
MATT: You gotcha. Both attacks are advantage
against the stunned creature, I believe. Yes.

00:52:17.755 --> 00:52:21.438
TRAVIS: They stay at advantage because of my
Mariner's Armor?

00:52:21.438 --> 00:52:22.523
MATT: Correct.

00:52:22.523 --> 00:52:31.034
TRAVIS: 15, that's going to hit. That's 30. Yeah,
I mean, that hits. That's 37 without the--

00:52:31.034 --> 00:52:32.206
MATT: Yeah, that hits.

00:52:32.206 --> 00:52:38.704
TRAVIS: Ooh god, double fours plus 12. 16, 20.

00:52:38.704 --> 00:52:44.431
MATT: 20 hits. Damage for the second strike, go
for it. As you swim down, quickly, falchion,

00:52:44.431 --> 00:52:47.665
whack, slicing across it.

00:52:47.665 --> 00:52:52.886
TRAVIS: 11 on the first, seven on the second. 18
points total.

00:52:52.886 --> 00:52:56.235
SAM: Beau, you're still alive!

00:52:56.235 --> 00:52:59.492
MARISHA: I'm still alive. I'm doing all right.

00:52:59.492 --> 00:53:06.009
TRAVIS: With my bonus action-- oh, I should have
done it first, but I'm fucking stupid. Look at

00:53:06.009 --> 00:53:11.190
that. I wrote it there, in big letters: Cast Hex.
Goddamn it.

00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:13.569
SAM: You're so dumb that you have to write down--

00:53:13.569 --> 00:53:19.979
TRAVIS: I'm only governing two characters right
now! Fuck me. Can I cast it with a bonus action?

00:53:19.979 --> 00:53:23.656
Yes. With my bonus action, I'll cast Hex and get
it up now.

00:53:23.657 --> 00:53:25.252
MATT: On the one that's stunned?

00:53:25.252 --> 00:53:35.457
TRAVIS: On the stunned one, please. It'll have
disadvantage on wisdom checks.

00:53:35.457 --> 00:53:40.313
MATT: Sure. There you go. Fjord, that finishes
your go. Jester and Caduceus, you guys are up.

00:53:40.313 --> 00:53:42.234
TALIESIN: I'm fine either way.

00:53:42.234 --> 00:53:49.995
LAURA: Okay. Then I'm going to use my bonus action
to bring my Spiritual Weapon down and attack the

00:53:49.995 --> 00:53:54.770
one that is next to Beau because it's stunned.

00:53:55.413 --> 00:53:57.143
MATT: It can move 20 feet, right?

00:53:57.143 --> 00:53:59.544
LAURA: It can move-- motherfucker.

00:53:59.544 --> 00:54:01.069
LIAM: It's short. It's 20 feet. I remember.

00:54:01.069 --> 00:54:02.225
LAURA: Can I get to it?

00:54:02.225 --> 00:54:07.067
MATT: Nope. It floats partway down-- jeez, I keep
dropping everything. Been gone for three weeks and

00:54:07.068 --> 00:54:12.385
I can't even function. It does get part of the
way, but next round it can get down there.

00:54:12.385 --> 00:54:26.957
LAURA: Balls. What a stupid-- okay. I'm going to
go up to the one that is... ugh. I'm going to--

00:54:26.957 --> 00:54:35.629
(unsure sound) It's a tough decision here.

00:54:35.629 --> 00:54:37.485
MATT: I know.

00:54:37.485 --> 00:54:39.127
LAURA: Here's the thing.

00:54:39.127 --> 00:54:40.196
TALIESIN: I'm fine, man.

00:54:40.196 --> 00:54:41.192
LAURA: Are you, though?

00:54:41.193 --> 00:54:42.295
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm fine.

00:54:42.295 --> 00:54:44.721
TRAVIS: You're wearing Cowboys colors. It's fine.
Take your time.

00:54:44.721 --> 00:54:50.514
LAURA: I'm going to go to the one that's attacking
Caduceus. I'm going to get behind it.

00:54:50.514 --> 00:54:51.695
MATT: You're going to swim up over the--

00:54:51.695 --> 00:54:53.434
LAURA: Up and over.

00:54:53.434 --> 00:54:55.943
MATT: You can get one, two, three. That's as far
as you can get.

00:54:55.943 --> 00:55:00.363
LAURA: Goddamn it. Forget it. I'm going to stay
where I am, motherfuck.

00:55:00.363 --> 00:55:03.053
MATT: Swimming is half movement, unfortunately.

00:55:03.054 --> 00:55:09.417
LAURA: Fuck. I'm going to fucking use fucking
stupid Toll the fucking Dead on the one at Yasha.

00:55:10.203 --> 00:55:13.566
LIAM: Character drops. Fuck this bullshit.

00:55:13.566 --> 00:55:14.602
MATT: It's a constitution saving throw?

00:55:14.603 --> 00:55:15.684
LAURA: It's a wisdom saving throw.

00:55:15.684 --> 00:55:17.865
TRAVIS: Everybody is ready to be out of the
water.

00:55:17.865 --> 00:55:19.145
MATT: That is a 14.

00:55:19.145 --> 00:55:27.692
LAURA: Oh, I get it. 12 points of bong damage.

00:55:30.384 --> 00:55:38.045
MATT: Beautiful. The area around its head where
there's an armored shell that protects its face

00:55:38.045 --> 00:55:42.766
area cracks a bit from the impact. Bits of its
shell are starting to flake off. That one's

00:55:42.766 --> 00:55:44.223
starting to look pretty hurt.

00:55:44.223 --> 00:55:47.945
LAURA: These things are tough, yo. I thought that
was going to kill the one with Yasha.

00:55:47.945 --> 00:55:50.346
MATT: Are you going to move or stay where you
are?

00:55:50.346 --> 00:55:51.764
LAURA: No, I'm going to stay!

00:55:51.764 --> 00:55:54.078
MATT: That ends your turn, then. Caduceus.

00:55:54.078 --> 00:56:11.067
TALIESIN: Man. Things are happening. Yeah, I'm
going to turn invisible.

00:56:11.067 --> 00:56:13.933
MARISHA: Everyone's at such a loss.

00:56:14.194 --> 00:56:16.862
LAURA: These guys are really tough, and they're so
spread out.

00:56:16.862 --> 00:56:19.176
SAM: Yeah. There's four of them.

00:56:19.176 --> 00:56:23.031
TALIESIN: That's only for a round. Then I'm going
to back away from this thing. I'm actually going

00:56:23.031 --> 00:56:27.504
to head around behind Jester, basically.

00:56:27.504 --> 00:56:32.546
MATT: It will make an attack of opportunity on you
as it sees you disappear. It goes out towards you.

00:56:32.546 --> 00:56:39.306
It has disadvantage on the attack. That is 17 to
hit.

00:56:39.306 --> 00:56:42.207
TALIESIN: That misses. I also might add that I
have the Shield of Retribution.

00:56:42.207 --> 00:56:43.122
MATT: You do.

00:56:43.122 --> 00:56:45.499
TALIESIN: I'm going to activate the Shield of
Retribution.

00:56:45.499 --> 00:56:46.593
TRAVIS: This is the first time?

00:56:46.593 --> 00:56:50.562
TALIESIN: Yep. It's the first time I'm using it.
When a creature misses with a melee attack, you

00:56:50.563 --> 00:56:56.099
may react to the blast with arcane force. You have
to succeed on a strength saving throw, but that's

00:56:56.099 --> 00:56:57.496
something else.

00:56:57.496 --> 00:56:58.602
MATT: Roll damage first.

00:56:58.602 --> 00:57:04.955
TALIESIN: Okay. Eh. 14 points of damage.

00:57:04.956 --> 00:57:10.116
MATT: 14 points of damage, nice. The strength
saving throw is a six.

00:57:10.116 --> 00:57:16.977
TALIESIN: It must succeed on a strength saving
throw-- is a six. I don't know what against. Must

00:57:16.977 --> 00:57:20.134
succeed on a strength saving throw against
something.

00:57:20.135 --> 00:57:21.425
MATT: That'd be your spell DC.

00:57:21.425 --> 00:57:26.985
TALIESIN: Then I think that's fine, yeah. You get
pushed back 20 feet.

00:57:26.985 --> 00:57:33.503
MATT: (blasting) It gets blasted back from the
impact. You see a flash from the shield and this

00:57:33.503 --> 00:57:40.745
bubble of energy well up and then force it back
with a sudden impact as it gets pushed away. You

00:57:40.745 --> 00:57:41.998
dart around the side.

00:57:41.998 --> 00:57:46.474
TALIESIN: I dart around the side. I'm coming as
far back as I can towards that wall, and I'm going

00:57:46.474 --> 00:57:52.664
to hold my actual action to do the same thing with
Yasha again, to give her the bonus kick to her

00:57:52.664 --> 00:57:53.865
first attack.

00:57:53.865 --> 00:57:54.455
MATT: That's your action?

00:57:54.455 --> 00:57:55.752
TALIESIN: That will be my action, yeah.

00:57:55.752 --> 00:58:03.862
MATT: Okay, cool. That ends your turn. Next up is
their turn. The one that got blasted back is going

00:58:03.862 --> 00:58:13.023
to move, (counting) 30. It's not within range to
actually get anybody, and it doesn't see where you

00:58:13.023 --> 00:58:17.294
are, so instead the person that it sees
immediately is going to be Caleb. Then it moves

00:58:17.294 --> 00:58:19.455
the rest of its 30 feet to get into--

00:58:19.456 --> 00:58:21.110
TALIESIN: Will it bump into me?

00:58:21.110 --> 00:58:27.928
MATT: We'll say it knocks you a little bit out of
the way, but it doesn't have anything to attack

00:58:27.928 --> 00:58:34.694
with because it used its action to get up next to
you. Currently is in melee with both of you. No, I

00:58:34.694 --> 00:58:39.033
didn't come across you. It didn't quite cross your
path. This one over here is going to--

00:58:39.033 --> 00:58:41.984
TALIESIN: How did it get so far? What's their
speed?

00:58:41.984 --> 00:58:43.551
ALL: Double dash.

00:58:43.551 --> 00:58:44.703
TALIESIN: Oh, fuck, okay.

00:58:44.704 --> 00:58:51.034
MATT: This one's stunned. This one here is going
to be now up against Fjord. It's going to strike

00:58:51.034 --> 00:58:52.802
out towards you twice, Fjord.

00:58:52.802 --> 00:58:57.089
MARISHA: I thought he had his little moment with
the little quick goblin.

00:58:57.089 --> 00:58:59.935
SAM and MATT: It's ignoring the goblin.

00:58:59.935 --> 00:59:02.893
SAM: Focusing on stronger things. The goblin's
still on its face.

00:59:02.893 --> 00:59:06.445
MATT: You can still do damage with it every turn,
and it still sees it, and is considering it--

00:59:06.445 --> 00:59:09.717
actually, I'll make an intelligence saving throw.

00:59:09.717 --> 00:59:14.458
MARISHA: You said you used the initiative of the
one that died by accident. It was coming up on

00:59:14.458 --> 00:59:18.446
this turn. It's all on one round, was what you said.

00:59:18.446 --> 00:59:21.683
SAM: I think you had it move, but you didn't have
it do an action yet, I don't think.

00:59:21.684 --> 00:59:23.738
MATT: No, it's true. You're right.

00:59:23.738 --> 00:59:24.910
MARISHA: Because I tried to do Sentinel on it.

00:59:24.911 --> 00:59:29.255
MATT: No, you're right. I fucked up my own order.
Cool.

00:59:29.255 --> 00:59:33.397
SAM: I don't think you did an action for it. You
just tried to move.

00:59:33.397 --> 00:59:41.173
MATT: It did. No, I had it waste its action to try
and attack the thing. Yep. As the two very big

00:59:41.173 --> 00:59:45.917
attacks on nothing, it's starting to not worry
about it. The other one is stunned. That ends its

00:59:45.917 --> 00:59:51.573
turn. The one on Yasha is going to attack twice.
That's going to be a natural 20.

00:59:51.573 --> 00:59:53.741
TALIESIN: Do I have a reaction, or did--

00:59:53.742 --> 00:59:55.523
MATT: You were using you reaction to hold your--

00:59:55.523 --> 00:59:58.546
TALIESIN: That is my reaction, is to hold my
attack?

00:59:58.546 --> 01:00:00.933
MATT: When you're holding an action, it uses your
reaction to release it.

01:00:00.933 --> 01:00:01.974
TALIESIN: Okay. Sorry.

01:00:01.974 --> 01:00:03.638
TRAVIS: She's raging; I think it's okay.

01:00:03.638 --> 01:00:05.957
MATT: The other one is a 17 to hit.

01:00:05.957 --> 01:00:07.040
TRAVIS: Both hit.

01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:19.527
MATT: All right. Critical is 22 bludgeoning damage
to her, reduced to 11, and the second one is nine

01:00:19.527 --> 01:00:24.761
points of bludgeoning damage, reduced to four.
She's grappled by it. It has her held in both of

01:00:24.761 --> 01:00:29.129
its claws, holding her there in front and then
tendrils begin to move towards her face. She needs

01:00:29.129 --> 01:00:30.616
to make a constitution saving throw, please.

01:00:30.616 --> 01:00:40.685
TRAVIS: Okay. 15 damage. Constitution saving
throw. Does she have advantage on-- no. Okay.

01:00:40.685 --> 01:00:42.409
LAURA: Plus four.

01:00:42.409 --> 01:00:47.110
TRAVIS: Oh, she's great. 24 plus-- 26.

01:00:47.110 --> 01:00:49.440
MATT: She's dealt with harsher toxins than this.
She doesn't even duck out of the way. She just

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:59.967
takes it and it doesn't have an effect. It burns
and nothing. I got that one and that one. Yeah,

01:00:59.967 --> 01:01:05.969
that's their turn. Man, that stun. That stun and
that illusion. That ends their go. Yasha's up now.

01:01:05.969 --> 01:01:11.606
TRAVIS: Yasha's going to try and get to Red
Lobster with two more swipes of the Magician's

01:01:11.606 --> 01:01:15.294
Judge. Reckless for straight attacks.

01:01:15.294 --> 01:01:17.127
TALIESIN: First one doubles.

01:01:17.128 --> 01:01:19.031
TRAVIS: Okay. What doubles?

01:01:19.031 --> 01:01:20.799
TALIESIN: All the damage. The first one is
doubled.

01:01:20.799 --> 01:01:24.663
TRAVIS: Oh, great! Okay, cool. 16 to hit?

01:01:24.664 --> 01:01:25.879
MATT: 16 just hits.

01:01:25.879 --> 01:01:34.567
TRAVIS: Oh, nice, and the second one is only an
11-- oh, wait. An 11 plus four. 15!

01:01:34.754 --> 01:01:35.929
MATT: Misses.

01:01:35.929 --> 01:01:38.537
TRAVIS: Damn it! But the first one does.

01:01:38.537 --> 01:01:39.667
MATT: But the first one does hit.

01:01:39.667 --> 01:01:40.275
TRAVIS: That's good. Okay.

01:01:40.275 --> 01:01:41.774
MATT: The first strike goes through, so it's full
damage times two.

01:01:41.774 --> 01:01:55.321
TRAVIS: Sweet. (counting) 19 times two, so 38?

01:01:55.322 --> 01:01:58.013
MATT: 38 points of damage. How does Yasha want to
do this?

01:01:58.013 --> 01:02:00.221
ALL: Oh!

01:02:00.221 --> 01:02:02.447
LAURA: Golf claps!

01:02:02.447 --> 01:02:07.319
TRAVIS: Yeah, sweet. She will come down in an
overarching right with that Magician's Judge, and

01:02:07.319 --> 01:02:13.512
on the second one she'll shove the sword in and
crack that fucking thing like a beautiful fillet.

01:02:13.512 --> 01:02:17.443
MATT: As she drags it down the side of its body,
she puts her foot up, and using that, she pushes

01:02:17.443 --> 01:02:22.839
to the side and watches it tear in half. You see a
bunch of internal purple sinew and muscle tear

01:02:22.839 --> 01:02:31.226
open. It gives this horrible dull squeak sound
before it goes limp and begins to float and slowly

01:02:31.226 --> 01:02:32.499
sink to the bottom.

01:02:32.499 --> 01:02:38.064
TRAVIS: (as Yasha) So many people leave so much
good food in here. Got to know how to eat lobster.

01:02:38.810 --> 01:02:42.534
MATT: That finishes Yasha's turn. She has
movement, yes.

01:02:42.534 --> 01:02:47.042
TRAVIS: She'll take her 15 feet towards the other
two.

01:02:47.042 --> 01:02:51.243
MATT: All right. One, two, three. She gets into
that one there.

01:02:51.243 --> 01:02:52.907
TRAVIS: Can she get on his ass?

01:02:52.907 --> 01:02:53.653
MATT: Yep.

01:02:53.653 --> 01:02:54.654
TRAVIS: Nice.

01:02:54.654 --> 01:02:58.452
MATT: All right, that finishes Yasha's go. Beau
and Nott, you guys are up.

01:02:58.452 --> 01:02:59.677
MARISHA: Okay.

01:02:59.677 --> 01:03:05.292
MATT: That one is still stunned, because it's
until the end of your next turn.

01:03:05.292 --> 01:03:15.310
MARISHA: Dope. I'm going to do a kick off the
ocean floor and I'm going to jump. I want to do an

01:03:15.310 --> 01:03:22.087
aerial over the two of them to land towards Fjord.
As I'm upside down in the air, I'm going to take

01:03:22.088 --> 01:03:23.473
my two attacks.

01:03:23.473 --> 01:03:25.672
MATT: Go for it.

01:03:25.672 --> 01:03:32.887
TALIESIN: I also like that you're bleeding, so
there's a perfect red corkscrew happening.

01:03:32.887 --> 01:03:34.662
MARISHA: So dope!

01:03:34.662 --> 01:03:37.721
MATT: No attack of opportunity from the one that's
stunned, so as you flip through the water--

01:03:37.722 --> 01:03:39.297
MARISHA: I'm going to go for the one that's not
stunned first.

01:03:39.297 --> 01:03:40.639
MATT: Go for it.

01:03:40.639 --> 01:03:48.481
MARISHA: Come on. That's good! That's a 17. I
really need to do math better. 22, plus?

01:03:48.481 --> 01:03:51.746
MATT: 22 hits. You can roll and extra d4. It's
still going to hit.

01:03:51.746 --> 01:03:52.804
MARISHA: 25?

01:03:52.804 --> 01:03:55.283
MATT: Yeah, so the first one hits. Roll damage for
that.

01:03:55.283 --> 01:04:00.864
MARISHA: Yeah, and then I'm going to try and stun
him.

01:04:00.864 --> 01:04:03.228
MATT: Okay. How much damage was that?

01:04:03.228 --> 01:04:06.150
MARISHA: Oh. Nine.

01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:12.967
MATT: Natural one. So now he's stunned. Monks,
man.

01:04:12.967 --> 01:04:15.510
SAM: Monks are insane.

01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:20.219
MATT: As you dart over, remember the place right
under its jaw where you're seeing its tendrils are

01:04:20.219 --> 01:04:25.416
trying to go towards you, you jam the staff right
into its throat there and as it does, it pulls

01:04:25.416 --> 01:04:29.579
back, unable to really get its bearings.

01:04:29.579 --> 01:04:35.936
MARISHA: Jester sees an arc of my blood through
the water as I'm bleeding and I cartwheel.

01:04:35.936 --> 01:04:37.525
LAURA: Beautiful!

01:04:37.525 --> 01:04:38.353
MATT: Second attack.

01:04:38.353 --> 01:04:41.780
MARISHA: Second attack. I'm going to go to the one
that's already stunned.

01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:44.539
MATT: These are both happening in the air as
you're arcing.

01:04:44.539 --> 01:04:47.360
MARISHA: This is just a straight roll, right?

01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:48.859
MATT: Correct.

01:04:48.859 --> 01:04:51.995
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

01:04:51.995 --> 01:04:55.674
MATT: Damn. The luck on this round.

01:04:55.674 --> 01:05:05.018
MARISHA: I've been using my fists as magical. Wow.
Cool. Real cool story.

01:05:05.018 --> 01:05:06.336
LIAM: Double that.

01:05:06.336 --> 01:05:10.714
MARISHA: Double that to a nice, awesome two. Six.

01:05:10.715 --> 01:05:13.330
MATT: Six points of damage. All right.

01:05:13.882 --> 01:05:16.035
MARISHA: My crit was less than my--

01:05:16.035 --> 01:05:21.490
LAURA: Your beautiful blood rainbow looks so
glamorous.

01:05:21.490 --> 01:05:22.524
MARISHA: Thank you.

01:05:22.525 --> 01:05:23.646
MATT: You still have your bonus.

01:05:23.646 --> 01:05:28.716
MARISHA: And flurry of Beaus. One more time. Pop
pop.

01:05:28.716 --> 01:05:32.238
LAURA: Branding? Somebody make that a t-shirt!

01:05:32.238 --> 01:05:35.870
MATT: Technically they're both stunned, but which
one do you want to do?

01:05:36.530 --> 01:05:38.152
MARISHA: I'll do the furthest one.

01:05:38.152 --> 01:05:40.096
MATT: Okay, the one that was stunned first. Got
it.

01:05:40.096 --> 01:05:47.208
MARISHA: Wow that's not cool. 13 plus-- give me a
four. 16?

01:05:47.208 --> 01:05:48.693
MATT: 16 just hits.

01:05:48.693 --> 01:05:56.765
MARISHA: Thank you, Bless! Okay, that would have
been awesome with that critical. Ten damage.

01:05:56.765 --> 01:05:58.569
MATT: Ten points of damage, all right.

01:05:58.569 --> 01:06:05.301
MARISHA: Second attack, same thing. Wait, no, hang
on. Six plus seven, so 13--

01:06:05.301 --> 01:06:08.323
LIAM: Cocked. It's very cocked.

01:06:08.323 --> 01:06:10.803
MARISHA: Yes! 17.

01:06:10.803 --> 01:06:14.650
MATT: That's the only time I've ever seen a cocked
d4. On the edge, yeah.

01:06:14.650 --> 01:06:16.251
MARISHA: It went in between my dice.

01:06:16.251 --> 01:06:17.004
MATT: I know, it's impressive.

01:06:17.004 --> 01:06:17.514
MARISHA: 17.

01:06:17.514 --> 01:06:18.233
MATT: 17 hits.

01:06:18.233 --> 01:06:19.838
LIAM: You're able to read people's thoughts after
that.

01:06:19.838 --> 01:06:23.339
MARISHA: Six damage.

01:06:23.339 --> 01:06:29.432
TRAVIS: You'll only know if it's Inception or not
if it falls over at some point.

01:06:31.793 --> 01:06:36.733
MATT: That is two impacts as you bludgeon that one
who's stunned and arc on the other side. It's

01:06:36.733 --> 01:06:41.284
looking hurt, but it's still in the fight. That
ends your turn?

01:06:41.284 --> 01:06:42.030
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:06:42.030 --> 01:06:44.303
MATT: All right, Beau's done. Nott.

01:06:44.303 --> 01:06:49.335
SAM: Because I'm a rogue, I'm going to go bolt,
bolt, bolt and fire three times.

01:06:49.335 --> 01:06:50.582
MATT: Okay.

01:06:50.582 --> 01:06:57.024
SAM: We got 25, 25, and 11.

01:06:57.024 --> 01:07:02.694
MATT: Those creatures are all stunned and they're
within your short range, so you have advantage on

01:07:02.694 --> 01:07:04.575
the attacks.

01:07:04.575 --> 01:07:12.575
SAM: Nope. 20 and then really low. Shit.

01:07:12.575 --> 01:07:13.752
MATT: Okay, so they all hit.

01:07:13.752 --> 01:07:14.634
LAURA: Yeah, but you didn't--

01:07:14.635 --> 01:07:19.167
SAM: I didn't specify which one. I've got to
reroll all of them. I'm rerolling all of them!

01:07:19.167 --> 01:07:20.491
MATT: Sam.

01:07:20.492 --> 01:07:21.886
SAM: It's all good. I didn't know I was going to
have advantage!

01:07:21.886 --> 01:07:22.930
MATT: Now you do. All right, first attack.

01:07:22.930 --> 01:07:24.868
SAM: All right, first attack is 22.

01:07:24.869 --> 01:07:25.715
MATT: That hits.

01:07:25.715 --> 01:07:29.006
SAM: Second attack is 26.

01:07:29.006 --> 01:07:29.986
MATT: That hits.

01:07:29.986 --> 01:07:31.931
SAM: Third attack is 25.

01:07:31.931 --> 01:07:35.236
MATT: That hits. Against which ones?

01:07:35.236 --> 01:07:39.712
SAM: The one that looked real rough.

01:07:39.712 --> 01:07:42.608
MATT: The first strike is against him. Roll your
sneak attack on him.

01:07:42.608 --> 01:07:51.264
SAM: 17 plus five, 22.

01:07:51.264 --> 01:08:01.387
MATT: The bolt gets lodged in its throat and it
just managed to shrug off the-- actually no, that

01:08:01.387 --> 01:08:07.711
one's not stunned anymore, because it was the end
of your turn. Oh man. I got this all confused. My

01:08:07.711 --> 01:08:11.343
own fault, go ahead. That first one probably would
have hit anyway at this distance, so that damage

01:08:11.343 --> 01:08:12.201
does take it out.

01:08:12.201 --> 01:08:15.553
SAM: The first time I rolled the first two hit and
the last one missed. Want to go with those?

01:08:15.553 --> 01:08:16.054
MATT: Right.

01:08:16.054 --> 01:08:17.167
SAM: So two hits.

01:08:17.167 --> 01:08:21.369
MATT: All right. The first one wipes it out. How
do you want to do this?

01:08:21.368 --> 01:08:24.822
(cheering)

01:08:24.822 --> 01:08:29.551
SAM: I would love the bolt to--

01:08:29.551 --> 01:08:30.755
MATT: Three weeks. Getting rusty.

01:08:30.756 --> 01:08:35.164
SAM: Oh boy. I would love for the bolts to go--
Fjord's right in front of it, right?

01:08:35.163 --> 01:08:35.792
MATT: Correct.

01:08:35.792 --> 01:08:40.336
SAM: I would love the bolt to go out through its
head and stop just shy of Fjord's face.

01:08:40.337 --> 01:08:43.657
TRAVIS: Crap fire!

01:08:43.657 --> 01:08:47.733
MATT: It slowly crumples to the bottom of the
ocean.

01:08:47.733 --> 01:08:49.306
TRAVIS: What in tarnation?!

01:08:49.305 --> 01:08:52.950
MARISHA: Sweet molasses!

01:08:52.950 --> 01:08:57.608
MATT: Take your next strike. The other one is
stunned, so those two other strikes would have

01:08:57.608 --> 01:08:59.121
hit, so you're fine.

01:08:59.121 --> 01:09:00.332
SAM: So I should roll for those?

01:09:00.332 --> 01:09:02.356
MATT: Yeah, roll damage for the other two.

01:09:02.356 --> 01:09:06.508
SAM: Damage, okay. Both were the same. Both were
seven points.

01:09:06.508 --> 01:09:09.127
MATT: All right, so 14 total. Got it.

01:09:09.707 --> 01:09:12.460
SAM: Is that the one that has the Phantasmal Force
on it?

01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:13.497
MATT: Correct.

01:09:13.497 --> 01:09:19.611
SAM: Yes? So that one also takes an extra five
points of psychic damage from a goblin on its face.

01:09:22.434 --> 01:09:23.967
TRAVIS: Hasted Nott, man.

01:09:23.966 --> 01:09:28.005
MATT: It takes the impact and spins around trying
to look towards you, and it sees you, but then

01:09:28.006 --> 01:09:31.671
you're still on its face. It's very confused.

01:09:31.671 --> 01:09:33.331
SAM: It's a confusing fight.

01:09:33.331 --> 01:09:34.934
MATT: Yeah. It's not having a good day.

01:09:34.934 --> 01:09:37.013
TRAVIS: It just wants to live.

01:09:37.013 --> 01:09:39.122
MATT: That finishes your turn, Nott. Caleb, you're
up.

01:09:39.122 --> 01:09:43.204
LIAM: I've been on my way over to the scrum over
there, trying to help, and I begin to weave Magic

01:09:43.203 --> 01:09:48.496
Missile again, and he is about to cast it and the
thing comes behind him and he goes: Whoa! and

01:09:48.496 --> 01:09:55.224
unleashes on the one right behind him. Magic
Missile, level three. Yeah, I need one more.

01:09:55.224 --> 01:09:58.382
(counting)

01:09:58.382 --> 01:10:00.487
LAURA: Those dice are really pretty. I like how
they're themed.

01:10:01.694 --> 01:10:03.216
LIAM: 15 total.

01:10:03.216 --> 01:10:04.722
MATT: 15 points of damage.

01:10:04.722 --> 01:10:07.404
LIAM: I'm not going to move, because it will claw
me in half.

01:10:07.404 --> 01:10:12.797
MATT: Probably. That ends your go, Caleb. The
impacts in the front of it. Parts of its chest

01:10:12.797 --> 01:10:18.549
blacken from the blast of the Magic Missile, but
it shrugs it off. This one seems relatively,

01:10:18.549 --> 01:10:23.677
comparably unharmed to the others. It's taken a
few hits, but it's doing all right. That finishes

01:10:23.677 --> 01:10:25.786
your go, Caleb. Fjord, you're up.

01:10:25.787 --> 01:10:33.942
TRAVIS: I'm worried about Caleb. Okay, let's do
it.

01:10:33.942 --> 01:10:37.115
MARISHA: Okay. This could be awesome.

01:10:37.115 --> 01:10:42.538
TRAVIS: I'm going to grab Beau's arm and go: Come
on, first mate, and cast Thunder Step. Take the

01:10:42.538 --> 01:10:45.415
falchion and shove it into the bottom of the
ocean.

01:10:45.415 --> 01:10:53.475
MATT: He slams the falchion into the ground.
There's a blast of electrical energy and this

01:10:53.475 --> 01:10:58.992
force wave immediately sucks in and they're
missing. They're gone. Where are you guys going?

01:10:58.992 --> 01:11:03.731
TRAVIS: We're going to come to Caleb's aid right
here. Does that sound good?

01:11:03.731 --> 01:11:04.692
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

01:11:04.692 --> 01:11:06.325
TRAVIS: And right behind me.

01:11:06.325 --> 01:11:07.804
MARISHA: Right behind Fjord.

01:11:07.804 --> 01:11:08.954
TRAVIS: All right, there you go.

01:11:08.954 --> 01:11:09.995
MARISHA: Yep, thank you.

01:11:09.995 --> 01:11:10.978
MATT: You got it.

01:11:10.978 --> 01:11:13.190
TRAVIS: That's 3d10 plus Hex.

01:11:13.190 --> 01:11:17.275
MATT: Does it get a dex saving throw against that
to try and reduce damage?

01:11:17.275 --> 01:11:20.058
TRAVIS: A constitution saving throw. Yes.

01:11:20.058 --> 01:11:21.335
MATT: That is going to be a 20.

01:11:21.335 --> 01:11:22.599
TRAVIS: Yeah, that saves.

01:11:22.599 --> 01:11:24.400
MATT: So does it take damage? Half damage?

01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:25.218
TRAVIS: It takes half.

01:11:25.218 --> 01:11:25.799
MATT: Got it.

01:11:25.799 --> 01:11:27.892
LAURA: What about Yasha?

01:11:35.058 --> 01:11:38.300
TRAVIS: That's 20 solid, so just ten. Ten points.

01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:43.692
MATT: Ten damage. As the water explodes and then
sucks in, the creature is stunned and is looking

01:11:43.692 --> 01:11:46.631
very hurt, but it's still (snarling).

01:11:46.631 --> 01:11:51.993
TRAVIS: Cool. It's only within ten feet, and I
think Yasha's 15 feet away from where Fjord was.

01:11:51.993 --> 01:11:55.563
MATT: Correct. The creature is ten spaces wide.

01:11:55.563 --> 01:12:01.558
TRAVIS: Awesome. With my bonus action, can I
transfer my Hex to that fuckstick?

01:12:01.558 --> 01:12:04.442
MATT: You can. Fuckstick has been Hexed.

01:12:04.442 --> 01:12:06.636
TRAVIS: Oh sorry wait, d6 for Hex. That's six.

01:12:06.636 --> 01:12:08.537
MATT: For which one? Oh, for Hex?

01:12:08.537 --> 01:12:10.524
TRAVIS: Yeah, because I cast Hex on that bastard.

01:12:10.524 --> 01:12:12.805
MATT: No, Hex was the other one that had died.

01:12:12.805 --> 01:12:15.107
TRAVIS: Thank you. You're right. Never mind.

01:12:15.107 --> 01:12:15.843
MATT: Sorry.

01:12:15.843 --> 01:12:17.107
TRAVIS: No, that's okay.

01:12:17.107 --> 01:12:19.577
MATT: That's all right. That finishes Fjord's go.
Jester, Caduceus, you're up. Caduceus, you

01:12:19.577 --> 01:12:20.881
reappear in your space.

01:12:20.881 --> 01:12:23.374
LAURA: Oh, hi, Caduceus!

01:12:23.374 --> 01:12:24.414
TALIESIN: Hey.

01:12:24.414 --> 01:12:28.115
LAURA: I'm going to move my Spiritual Weapon down
to try to hit the one next to Yasha.

01:12:28.115 --> 01:12:30.041
TRAVIS: Let's go now!

01:12:30.041 --> 01:12:30.898
MATT: Go for it.

01:12:30.898 --> 01:12:31.954
TRAVIS: Let's go!

01:12:31.954 --> 01:12:36.775
MATT: It has advantage because it's stunned.

01:12:36.775 --> 01:12:43.437
LAURA: Oh sweet! Doesn't it balance out, though,
because it would've been at disadvantage?

01:12:43.438 --> 01:12:48.590
MATT: It's a Spiritual Weapon. It's not material,
so it's not hindered by--

01:12:49.107 --> 01:12:50.025
LAURA: 17.

01:12:50.025 --> 01:12:50.969
MATT: 17 hits.

01:12:50.970 --> 01:13:00.112
LAURA: Okay. Eight plus four is 12 points!

01:13:00.463 --> 01:13:01.660
MATT: How do you want to do this?

01:13:01.660 --> 01:13:03.884
(cheering)

01:13:04.262 --> 01:13:09.380
LAURA: I'm going to use the Spiritual Weapon and
try to shove it into its mouth over and over

01:13:09.381 --> 01:13:12.266
again, saying: Eat it! It's good!

01:13:12.266 --> 01:13:20.251
MATT: Eventually it jams itself into this
creature's maw repeatedly as it backs away. The

01:13:20.252 --> 01:13:24.774
back of its shelled head begins to crack before it
splinters at the back. The Spiritual Weapon

01:13:24.774 --> 01:13:29.114
emerges from the back of its skull and it crumples
to the ground.

01:13:29.114 --> 01:13:30.299
TRAVIS: Yeah!

01:13:31.286 --> 01:13:39.270
LAURA: Then for my action I'm going to say: Oh,
hi, Fjord, and I'm going to jump up and land on

01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:41.210
its back next to me.

01:13:41.210 --> 01:13:44.192
MATT: Over here? All right.

01:13:45.215 --> 01:13:50.866
LAURA: I'm going to cast Inflict Wounds at
2nd-level.

01:13:50.866 --> 01:13:54.448
MATT: All right. Because of Caleb's position, you
do have flanking bonus, so you have advantage on

01:13:54.448 --> 01:13:55.617
the attack roll.

01:13:55.617 --> 01:13:57.797
LAURA: Ooh! Okay.

01:13:57.797 --> 01:13:59.669
TRAVIS: It's a spell, so there's no disadvantage
right?

01:13:59.669 --> 01:14:01.848
LAURA: Right, it's a touch, so it's not a melee
attack.

01:14:01.848 --> 01:14:07.897
MATT: Technically it's considered a melee attack,
so you would have disadvantage on the strike, but

01:14:07.897 --> 01:14:10.026
it give you advantage because he's there, so it's
just a straight roll.

01:14:10.026 --> 01:14:16.268
LAURA: Okay. 24.

01:14:16.268 --> 01:14:17.351
MATT: 24 hits.

01:14:17.351 --> 01:14:21.396
TRAVIS: Yeah! It's like, "What's up over here?"

01:14:21.396 --> 01:14:32.097
LAURA: That's how many? How many do I roll? 4d10--
no, wait. 4d10.

01:14:32.097 --> 01:14:37.802
MATT: 4d10. Ooh. Roll some damage.

01:14:37.802 --> 01:14:43.690
LAURA: 14 points of crab damage.

01:14:43.690 --> 01:14:50.873
MATT: As you reach out, after flipping over and
landing behind it, you grab the back of it, and

01:14:51.036 --> 01:14:56.526
you see the divine energy pulse through, this dull
grayish-blue energy arc down your forearms, hit

01:14:56.526 --> 01:15:02.934
the shell, and these sparks of dark energy break
through, causing these small bits of its shell to

01:15:02.934 --> 01:15:09.849
break and flake off in areas. It's shocked from
the impact. Did a pretty decent bit of hurt to it.

01:15:09.849 --> 01:15:13.704
That the end of your turn? I believe it does.
Caduceus, what are you doing?

01:15:13.704 --> 01:15:19.937
TALIESIN: I'm going to Sacred Flame this guy. I'm
going to step back a little bit. 15 feet.

01:15:19.937 --> 01:15:22.466
MATT: It's going to make an attack towards you.

01:15:22.466 --> 01:15:23.496
TALIESIN: Yeah. Get rid of your stuff.

01:15:23.496 --> 01:15:27.099
MATT: That's going to be 21 to hit.

01:15:27.099 --> 01:15:27.909
TALIESIN: Oh, that hits.

01:15:27.909 --> 01:15:34.077
MATT: Okay. You take eight plus six points of
damage, that's 14, and you are grappled, so you do

01:15:34.078 --> 01:15:34.956
not move.

01:15:34.956 --> 01:15:36.368
TALIESIN: Okay. I still get my attack, though?

01:15:36.368 --> 01:15:42.137
MATT: You do. Also make a constitution saving
throw to see if you can maintain Bless.

01:15:42.137 --> 01:15:53.954
TALIESIN: 14 points of damage? And constitution
saving throw. Nine.

01:15:53.954 --> 01:15:58.255
MATT: Nine. Bless fades. Those who were blessed by
Caduceus, you no longer get your d4 bonuses.

01:15:58.255 --> 01:15:59.390
TALIESIN: Sorry!

01:15:59.390 --> 01:16:02.403
TRAVIS: That's okay. We've appreciated it this
entire fight.

01:16:02.403 --> 01:16:05.347
TALIESIN: Make a dex saving throw.

01:16:05.347 --> 01:16:07.303
MATT: Dex saving throw? Natural one!

01:16:07.426 --> 01:16:17.896
TALIESIN: All right, that's nice. Take seven
points of radiant damage.

01:16:17.896 --> 01:16:22.709
MATT: You got it. After it grabs and pulls you in,
you actually blast it from inside its claw. You

01:16:22.709 --> 01:16:27.338
release the spell from your staff and the flame
burns up the outside, blackening the outside of

01:16:27.338 --> 01:16:32.946
its crustacean-like armored shell. Ending your
turn, Caduceus, correct? All right. It's now its

01:16:32.946 --> 01:16:46.958
turn. It has Caduceus grappled in one claw. Yep.
Yeah, it's going to continue its path. It releases

01:16:47.161 --> 01:16:55.562
Caduceus, and it's going to go all in on its
original quarry, which is Caleb. It's a natural 18

01:16:55.562 --> 01:16:57.545
plus six, that's 24 to hit.

01:16:57.545 --> 01:17:05.116
LIAM: No, that hits, sorry. I was going
backwards.

01:17:05.116 --> 01:17:11.564
MATT: 15 points of bludgeoning damage, and you are
grappled.

01:17:11.564 --> 01:17:12.347
LIAM: Yeah.

01:17:12.347 --> 01:17:17.718
MATT: Second attack. That's going to be 20 to
hit.

01:17:17.718 --> 01:17:18.965
LIAM: Yeah.

01:17:18.966 --> 01:17:30.125
MATT: That is 11 points of bludgeoning damage. As
it slams both of its claws into you, it's grabbing

01:17:30.125 --> 01:17:35.159
you from both sides of your torso and legs,
pulling apart as the pain hits in. It grabs you in

01:17:35.159 --> 01:17:39.779
towards its face and its tendrils lap around your
head and neck area. Make a constitution saving

01:17:39.779 --> 01:17:41.348
throw for me.

01:17:41.348 --> 01:17:47.265
LAURA: It feels like Frumpkin, only painful.

01:17:47.265 --> 01:17:48.081
LIAM: Ten.

01:17:48.081 --> 01:17:57.295
MATT: As the venom pulses into your body, you feel
your entire torso, legs, arms, seize with searing

01:17:57.295 --> 01:18:01.387
pain. You are paralyzed and poisoned.

01:18:01.387 --> 01:18:04.288
SAM: Ugh! What does that do?

01:18:04.288 --> 01:18:14.289
LIAM: What if the roll had actually been--&lt;i&gt;
shite&lt;/i&gt;, 13? Would that have changed it?

01:18:14.289 --> 01:18:16.070
MATT: Why would you have had to change it?

01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:21.005
LIAM: Because I have the transmuter's stone, which
is giving me proficiency on constitution saves, if

01:18:21.005 --> 01:18:22.631
I'm remembering correctly.

01:18:22.631 --> 01:18:26.521
MATT: I trust you on that. 13 would resist it.
It's a DC 13.

01:18:26.521 --> 01:18:28.663
LIAM: Proficiency in constitution saving throws.
That's what I have.

01:18:28.663 --> 01:18:30.973
MATT: So yeah, and that would be enough to resist
it.

01:18:30.974 --> 01:18:36.535
TRAVIS: You found that fast. You're turning into
Mercer. I can't find shit in that book!

01:18:36.535 --> 01:18:43.050
MATT: As the poison begins to pulse into your
system, in the moment the pain begins to hit the

01:18:43.051 --> 01:18:47.980
back of your skull, you immediately glance towards
the transmuter's stone that you're clutching in

01:18:47.980 --> 01:18:52.346
your right hand, and with that, you feel the
energy pulse through your body and shrug off the

01:18:52.346 --> 01:18:54.445
toxin from entering the deep parts of your
system.

01:18:54.445 --> 01:18:57.304
TRAVIS: Put it up top, Widogast!

01:18:57.305 --> 01:19:02.977
LIAM: There's a slight crooked little smile
peeking out from underneath Frumpkin on my head.

01:19:02.977 --> 01:19:08.327
MATT: Perfect. Ending its turn, Yasha's up.

01:19:08.328 --> 01:19:10.389
SAM: End it, Yash.

01:19:10.389 --> 01:19:14.679
TRAVIS: Can she peek in the doorway?

01:19:14.679 --> 01:19:15.817
MATT: Sure.

01:19:15.817 --> 01:19:20.609
TRAVIS: Not that she doesn't think all of her
friends can't handle it, but--

01:19:20.609 --> 01:19:23.947
MATT: She looks inside, and there, skitter-- no,
I'm kidding.

01:19:23.947 --> 01:19:26.926
(laughter)

01:19:26.926 --> 01:19:28.064
LIAM: The queen.

01:19:28.064 --> 01:19:29.914
TRAVIS: I was like, no, I'm not killing Ashley's
character!

01:19:29.914 --> 01:19:36.096
MATT: Looking through the interior of the now
partially jagged, broken entrance to this temple's

01:19:36.096 --> 01:19:44.661
base, you can see this very heavily covered,
seaweed-infested interior that wraps around the

01:19:44.662 --> 01:19:50.750
inside, and one central, big, knotted tangle of
seaweed.

01:19:50.750 --> 01:19:51.930
TRAVIS: Cool.

01:19:51.930 --> 01:19:53.110
MATT: Is that Yasha's turn?

01:19:53.110 --> 01:19:53.728
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:19:53.729 --> 01:19:55.909
MATT: Top of the round: Beau and Nott.

01:19:55.909 --> 01:19:57.575
TRAVIS: That'll drop her rage, too.

01:19:57.575 --> 01:20:05.621
MATT: Yes, it will. It's where Nott's been the
whole time. Hiding right over there.

01:20:05.622 --> 01:20:08.801
MARISHA: Okay, you want me to see if I can punch
this guy first?

01:20:08.801 --> 01:20:11.392
SAM: Yeah, you go first. You're way closer.

01:20:11.392 --> 01:20:18.791
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to take my staff for this
one. I'm going to, between Fjord, go: Excuse me!

01:20:18.792 --> 01:20:21.479
See if I can get it.

01:20:21.479 --> 01:20:23.271
MATT: Excuse me!

01:20:23.271 --> 01:20:24.692
TRAVIS: Back, you!

01:20:24.692 --> 01:20:26.595
MARISHA: Get! Get on!

01:20:26.595 --> 01:20:29.333
MATT: You scoot around and jam it.

01:20:29.333 --> 01:20:30.632
MARISHA: Oh my god!

01:20:30.632 --> 01:20:32.846
TRAVIS: It was a 20 for two seconds.

01:20:32.846 --> 01:20:45.593
MARISHA: Why does this always happen to me? Yeah,
that's pretty good, though. 21. Okay, that's 18

01:20:45.594 --> 01:20:47.873
plus two, so 20.

01:20:47.873 --> 01:20:49.679
MATT: For your second attack?

01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:56.972
MARISHA: No, for the disadvantage first attack.
Right? Disadvantage? So the first one is six

01:20:56.972 --> 01:21:08.327
damage. No, sorry, seven damage. Three plus four.
Then the next one is missing, definitely missing

01:21:08.328 --> 01:21:09.947
with a two.

01:21:09.947 --> 01:21:15.483
MATT: Unfortunately, no. Your first strike is
prodding it with the staff. You still have your

01:21:15.483 --> 01:21:16.777
bonus action.

01:21:16.777 --> 01:21:19.713
MARISHA: Yeah, I guess I'll just punch it one more
time.

01:21:19.713 --> 01:21:22.029
TRAVIS: The club punch. Bitch!

01:21:22.029 --> 01:21:26.598
MARISHA: Yeah. Through the crowd, grabbing its
hair.

01:21:26.598 --> 01:21:29.355
TRAVIS: Walk away with some weave in your hand.

01:21:29.355 --> 01:21:35.709
MARISHA: Jesus, I don't think that's going to do
it either, unless-- 14?

01:21:35.710 --> 01:21:39.737
MATT: 14 misses, unfortunately. Doesn't miss; you
impact and reach through and--

01:21:39.737 --> 01:21:42.568
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:21:42.568 --> 01:21:46.557
MATT: That finishes Beau's turn, Nott, you're up.

01:21:46.557 --> 01:21:52.036
SAM: I'll swim closer. I'll fire. Actually, with
one hand I will take another swig of booze, if I

01:21:52.037 --> 01:21:55.883
can under the water somehow, and with the other
hand, I'll fire.

01:21:55.883 --> 01:21:57.943
MATT: There you go.

01:21:57.944 --> 01:22:01.168
SAM: Natural 20.

01:22:01.168 --> 01:22:04.826
MATT: All right, roll your sneak attack damage.

01:22:04.826 --> 01:22:07.181
MARISHA: Fucking one-handed bandit.

01:22:07.181 --> 01:22:13.656
SAM: Do I double it?

01:22:13.657 --> 01:22:14.738
MATT: Yes, you do.

01:22:14.738 --> 01:22:24.479
SAM: Dice damage is doubled. (counting) 23.

01:22:24.479 --> 01:22:26.297
MATT: How do you want to do this?

01:22:26.297 --> 01:22:28.526
(cheering)

01:22:28.526 --> 01:22:40.081
SAM: Let's see here. It's a crossbow bolt. I
would, again, like the crossbow bolt to tickle

01:22:40.081 --> 01:22:44.003
Fjord's ear as it whizzes by.

01:22:44.003 --> 01:22:45.678
TRAVIS: A little slice?

01:22:45.678 --> 01:22:47.592
SAM: Yeah, just a little.

01:22:47.592 --> 01:22:52.107
MATT: There's a brief bit of warm, hot, sharp pain
on the outside of your earlobe.

01:22:52.107 --> 01:22:53.609
SAM: Sorry!

01:22:53.609 --> 01:22:58.145
MATT: --as the bolt enters the base of the
creature's skull. You don't see it protrude. You

01:22:58.145 --> 01:23:02.475
don't even know where it went. You just see it
vanish and the creature is standing there for a

01:23:02.475 --> 01:23:10.897
second. As it falls onto its back, its legs all
curl in like a spider and its claws close in.

01:23:10.897 --> 01:23:17.236
SAM: Accidentally, because I rolled a natural 20,
I shoot again.

01:23:17.236 --> 01:23:19.282
MATT: That's right!

01:23:19.283 --> 01:23:21.621
SAM: Shit, sorry!

01:23:21.621 --> 01:23:27.078
MATT: This time you, with the falchion, rake it
out of the air.

01:23:27.078 --> 01:23:30.065
SAM: Sorry, it's the thing! It does it!

01:23:30.065 --> 01:23:33.172
TRAVIS: I don't know if I believe you.

01:23:33.172 --> 01:23:40.089
MATT: A few moments pass as you guys glance around
the area to take in whether or not there's some

01:23:40.090 --> 01:23:43.234
danger. You manage to pull off the pincer from
around your body.

01:23:43.234 --> 01:23:46.196
TALIESIN: I'm all right. I think everybody could
take a few minutes.

01:23:46.196 --> 01:23:49.390
LAURA: Beau, Caleb, you guys look bloody.

01:23:49.390 --> 01:23:50.768
MARISHA: Does this look bad?

01:23:50.768 --> 01:23:53.389
SAM and TALIESIN: Ugh!

01:23:53.389 --> 01:23:58.758
LIAM: Caleb pulls up and there's claw piercing all
along the ribs.

01:23:58.758 --> 01:24:01.061
LAURA: Yeah, looks like shit.

01:24:01.061 --> 01:24:03.295
SAM: But the salt water--

01:24:03.295 --> 01:24:08.622
LAURA: Yeah, it's cleaning it. I think we should
maybe rest a little bit.

01:24:08.622 --> 01:24:11.086
LIAM: Caleb sits down in the muck.

01:24:11.086 --> 01:24:15.046
TRAVIS: Actually, if we went inside, then at least
anything that's swimming overhead with big teeth

01:24:15.046 --> 01:24:16.395
might not see us.

01:24:16.395 --> 01:24:18.479
TALIESIN: That's true.

01:24:18.479 --> 01:24:21.109
LAURA: As long as nothing attacks us inside.

01:24:21.109 --> 01:24:24.247
TALIESIN: I can take ten minutes and give everyone
a little bit of a boost.

01:24:24.247 --> 01:24:31.475
TRAVIS: That would be great. Yasha, do you see
anything in there? (quietly) No.

01:24:31.475 --> 01:24:33.746
(laughter)

01:24:33.746 --> 01:24:36.054
SAM: (exaggerated Swedish accent) No, I don't!

01:24:36.054 --> 01:24:39.042
MATT: She looks back from the inside and goes--

01:24:39.042 --> 01:24:42.060
LAURA: He tried to do it!

01:24:42.060 --> 01:24:43.986
TRAVIS: Error 404!

01:24:43.986 --> 01:24:45.593
MATT: The lip quiver.

01:24:45.593 --> 01:24:57.885
(laughter)

01:24:57.886 --> 01:25:06.438
MATT: She looks back and goes, "There's a cluster
of seaweed inside." Steps into the interior--

01:25:06.438 --> 01:25:13.915
doesn't enter the entire structure, but steps in
the middle, waiting for any sort of direction from

01:25:13.915 --> 01:25:14.888
you guys.

01:25:14.888 --> 01:25:19.977
TRAVIS: Deuce, do you want to take a look, make
sure that it's not the ravenous variety?

01:25:19.977 --> 01:25:25.632
TALIESIN: I'll look in the door before we sit
down. Is this thing giving me a vibe?

01:25:25.632 --> 01:25:28.844
MATT: Make a nature check for me, if you don't
mind.

01:25:28.845 --> 01:25:30.701
TALIESIN: Nature check, oh no.

01:25:30.701 --> 01:25:32.705
TRAVIS: I'll help Caleb over to the door.

01:25:32.705 --> 01:25:34.288
TALIESIN: My nature check weirdly sucks.

01:25:34.288 --> 01:25:35.446
LAURA: I'll help Beau!

01:25:35.447 --> 01:25:39.232
TALIESIN: Yeah, I know, it's funny how my nature
check is terrible. 13.

01:25:39.232 --> 01:25:44.967
MATT: Looking at the seaweed in this interior, it
is of the same variety as that which is clustered

01:25:44.967 --> 01:25:51.505
around the rest of this tower. It is not similar,
from what you can tell, to what you encountered at

01:25:51.506 --> 01:26:01.477
Dashilla's lair in the Diver's Grave. You're not
certain if it has any interest in you guys, but it

01:26:01.477 --> 01:26:05.352
doesn't seem to be reacting to your presence.

01:26:05.352 --> 01:26:13.117
TALIESIN: It doesn't seem to be a problem. We're
just going to be here for a minute, and then we'll

01:26:13.117 --> 01:26:20.462
be on our way. Let me know if you've got any
issue, and we'll do our best to stay out of your business.

01:26:22.183 --> 01:26:24.386
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

01:26:24.386 --> 01:26:27.229
SAM: Roll for kelp.

01:26:27.229 --> 01:26:28.770
TALIESIN: 15!

01:26:28.770 --> 01:26:34.588
LAURA: I like that, regardless of the character,
Taliesin likes to charm plant life.

01:26:34.588 --> 01:26:39.348
TALIESIN: I do! Plant life needs love, man.

01:26:39.348 --> 01:26:42.182
MATT: Life needs love to live!

01:26:42.182 --> 01:26:46.396
TALIESIN: Aw, see, now I feel better about the
whole-- thank you.

01:26:46.396 --> 01:26:48.973
LIAM: (NPR announcer voice)
This is Grass Talk on KCRW.

01:26:48.973 --> 01:26:51.558
MATT: What are the rest of you doing?

01:26:51.558 --> 01:26:58.250
MARISHA: I would like to go in and find a little
bed of seaweed and lay down for a minute.

01:26:58.250 --> 01:27:03.564
LAURA: Not the stuff in the middle. Maybe just lay
on the silt.

01:27:04.174 --> 01:27:07.928
TALIESIN: Anybody who needs a heal, I'm going to
do the ten-minute-- I'm going to start in the

01:27:07.928 --> 01:27:11.416
interior of this the Prayer of Healing, so anybody
who needs--

01:27:11.766 --> 01:27:13.107
MARISHA: Is anybody against a short rest?

01:27:13.107 --> 01:27:14.269
LIAM: I need a short rest.

01:27:14.269 --> 01:27:15.713
TALIESIN: Can we afford a short rest?

01:27:15.713 --> 01:27:19.146
TRAVIS: Yeah, we have 24 hours of breathing, so
we're okay.

01:27:19.146 --> 01:27:20.233
LIAM: Yes, please.

01:27:20.233 --> 01:27:22.522
MARISHA: I'm pretty tapped on ki points and--

01:27:22.522 --> 01:27:24.481
TALIESIN: I will not say no to a short rest.

01:27:24.481 --> 01:27:25.303
MARISHA: -- blood.

01:27:25.303 --> 01:27:26.691
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's get inside.

01:27:26.691 --> 01:27:28.177
TALIESIN: Nothing's looking for us.

01:27:28.177 --> 01:27:30.267
LIAM: I am dropping and leaning against
Beauregard.

01:27:30.590 --> 01:27:31.956
TALIESIN: Never mind, I'm not casting the spell.

01:27:31.956 --> 01:27:35.927
TRAVIS: Jester, that was very impressive, I must
say.

01:27:35.927 --> 01:27:40.168
LAURA: What? Oh, you mean that little Inflict
Wounds that I did?

01:27:40.168 --> 01:27:42.852
TRAVIS: And the use of the lollipop. Really nice
stuff.

01:27:42.852 --> 01:27:44.818
LAURA: Oh yeah, that lollipop's pretty freaking
cool!

01:27:46.908 --> 01:27:50.618
MARISHA: That's old business. We've seen that
one.

01:27:53.559 --> 01:27:55.681
MATT: As you guys take a short rest, you can use
your hit dice to heal up.

01:27:55.681 --> 01:27:57.130
TRAVIS: We'll be inside.

01:27:57.131 --> 01:27:59.149
MARISHA: Are you doing your thing? No?

01:27:59.149 --> 01:28:02.488
TALIESIN: No, if we're taking a short rest. That's
if you don't want a short rest, but you want to

01:28:02.488 --> 01:28:03.648
roll out.

01:28:03.648 --> 01:28:04.440
MARISHA: Copy.

01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:09.799
SAM: While we're around down here, can I swim
around, look for any other trap doors, or doors,

01:28:09.799 --> 01:28:10.790
or doors?

01:28:10.790 --> 01:28:14.528
MATT: Sure. Make a perception check at first.

01:28:14.528 --> 01:28:17.247
SAM: Perception. Four.

01:28:17.247 --> 01:28:20.411
MATT: Okay. Then make an investigation check.

01:28:20.411 --> 01:28:26.019
SAM: Four. Oh wait, plus! I get pluses on that.
13.

01:28:26.019 --> 01:28:32.897
MATT: That's better. Looking around the interior,
there doesn't appear to be any trap doors or

01:28:32.897 --> 01:28:38.783
anything that's hidden amongst the space. There's
the heavy clusters of seaweed that fill up along

01:28:38.783 --> 01:28:42.913
the walls, and it largely obscures-- when you look
up, you can see-- because it's dark inside, aside

01:28:42.913 --> 01:28:46.575
from the light that's there. At the very top of
the tower, where the light tends to fade, you see

01:28:46.575 --> 01:28:53.443
the open circular top where the faint bit of blue
light from the sky above comes through the ocean.

01:28:53.443 --> 01:28:58.887
You can see all the different slowly-waving
tendrils of seaweed cluttering up a lot of that

01:28:58.887 --> 01:29:05.780
space. The center area, you glance over, and you
can see where that big mass of seaweed and

01:29:05.780 --> 01:29:12.848
underwater plant life is. Along the edge of where
it is, you prod it, and it softly gives a little

01:29:12.848 --> 01:29:14.827
bit, past the floor.

01:29:14.827 --> 01:29:16.848
LAURA: Ooh!

01:29:16.848 --> 01:29:19.317
SAM: There's a door or something over here!

01:29:19.317 --> 01:29:21.532
TRAVIS: Yasha's back up to full.

01:29:21.532 --> 01:29:29.817
LAURA: Can I have been outside looking at the
(clicking) that we fought so I can look at him and

01:29:29.817 --> 01:29:30.957
see what's going on?

01:29:30.957 --> 01:29:33.527
TRAVIS: Careful as you head out there. You don't
know what's above you.

01:29:33.527 --> 01:29:35.319
SAM: He cares about you.

01:29:35.319 --> 01:29:42.201
MATT: The tendrils that are from its head that you
saw trailing behind it are as long as the length

01:29:42.201 --> 01:29:47.749
of its body. There's about 12 of them that drift
behind it, though they're all limp now, and it

01:29:47.749 --> 01:29:56.798
just lies there, destroyed. It's wearing an old,
slightly tattered robe, who knows how ancient.

01:29:56.798 --> 01:30:04.197
That's as much detail as you can make off of it,
other than its jaws limply hanging open, these

01:30:04.198 --> 01:30:09.461
dull lifeless flaps where you can see the toothy
interior of its mouth as it hangs.

01:30:09.461 --> 01:30:12.521
LAURA: Does its busted-up robe have pockets?

01:30:12.521 --> 01:30:15.447
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:30:15.448 --> 01:30:18.988
SAM: Oh, that was a journey.

01:30:18.988 --> 01:30:21.961
LAURA: Yeah, that was. What was it before I
accidentally hit it?

01:30:21.961 --> 01:30:23.109
SAM: Three.

01:30:23.109 --> 01:30:26.498
LAURA: Okay. Oh, four! Hey!

01:30:26.498 --> 01:30:30.967
MATT: Look at that! Change your group name to The
Mighty Four here today.

01:30:30.967 --> 01:30:32.387
TALIESIN: We are not paying attention to things.

01:30:32.387 --> 01:30:36.697
MATT: I know! Well, you're all a little busted
about that previous battle. No pockets, no

01:30:36.697 --> 01:30:40.600
keepsakes. It looks like it's pretty plainly
adorned.

01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:45.460
TALIESIN: Is there something in the middle of all
that tendril in the center of this tower? Is it

01:30:45.460 --> 01:30:46.926
obscuring something?

01:30:47.451 --> 01:30:48.886
LAURA: That's what he said. It's actually a hole
in the middle.

01:30:48.886 --> 01:30:54.165
MATT: You go over and look. A lot of this is--
there's roots around the edge of it where some of

01:30:54.165 --> 01:30:58.954
the plant has rooted itself to the stone floor of
this temple, but there's large portions of it that

01:30:58.954 --> 01:31:07.156
go beyond those roots. Upon pushing on it, it has
some give below that central area. It looks like

01:31:07.156 --> 01:31:10.625
there's some sort of opening or a space below the
center.

01:31:10.625 --> 01:31:15.814
TALIESIN: Oh, I suppose we're going to be heading
down.

01:31:15.814 --> 01:31:22.304
TRAVIS: I don't want to disturb the fauna. Is
there a more genteel way to make our way through?

01:31:22.304 --> 01:31:33.426
TALIESIN: We're going to be having to head down
below. We're going to try not to disturb your root

01:31:33.426 --> 01:31:38.251
structure, but if there's another way down that
you might happen to know of, we would appreciate

01:31:38.251 --> 01:31:46.215
any clue as to what that may be. No shift in the
water, nothing? No little twitch?

01:31:46.215 --> 01:31:47.700
MATT: No.

01:31:47.700 --> 01:31:50.532
TALIESIN: I apologize to the interruption of your
very calm day.

01:31:50.532 --> 01:31:54.254
LIAM: Did one of you do healing and I missed it?

01:31:54.254 --> 01:31:58.590
TALIESIN: We did a short rest, so everybody
thumped. Are you all right with where you are?

01:31:58.590 --> 01:32:03.554
LAURA: Hey, you know what, though? I bet that the
seaweed is actually really happy because before it

01:32:03.554 --> 01:32:09.380
had those crab things, and claws and stuff
constantly fucking with it. Now we're really nice,

01:32:09.380 --> 01:32:11.264
and it's calm and peaceful in here.

01:32:11.264 --> 01:32:13.401
TALIESIN: I mean, we don't have the best history,
but sure.

01:32:13.401 --> 01:32:15.513
LAURA: With this seaweed specifically.

01:32:15.513 --> 01:32:16.922
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's fair.

01:32:16.922 --> 01:32:19.241
TRAVIS: Jester, you find anything on that guy?

01:32:19.241 --> 01:32:20.882
LAURA: Oh, he had a robe on.

01:32:20.882 --> 01:32:23.282
TRAVIS: No pendants or necklaces or keys?

01:32:23.283 --> 01:32:26.737
LAURA: Not that I could see. It seemed like a
pretty old robe that didn't have any pockets or

01:32:26.737 --> 01:32:34.726
anything. He did have really long, tendril-y hair,
which was pretty cool! Did you want to bring the

01:32:34.726 --> 01:32:39.105
body inside or something so that whatever is out
there won't see that we killed it?

01:32:39.105 --> 01:32:44.642
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's do that. Yasha will help you
pull the body back in.

01:32:44.642 --> 01:32:51.664
SAM: Why don't you guys go out there together on a
walkaround, just a little-- you guys could go

01:32:51.664 --> 01:32:53.191
together is all I'm saying!

01:32:53.191 --> 01:32:54.133
TRAVIS: Who, Yasha and her?

01:32:54.133 --> 01:32:57.443
SAM: No, Fjord! Fjord and Jessie could go
together!

01:32:57.443 --> 01:32:59.387
LAURA: But Yasha's really strong.

01:32:59.387 --> 01:33:02.902
SAM: Sure, but so are you, and you could show
him--

01:33:02.902 --> 01:33:03.952
LAURA: Okay.

01:33:03.952 --> 01:33:05.917
TRAVIS: I don't mind.

01:33:05.917 --> 01:33:10.206
SAM: Go on, have fun, take your time.

01:33:10.206 --> 01:33:11.481
TRAVIS: All right?

01:33:11.481 --> 01:33:13.093
SAM: Do you need any money?

01:33:13.093 --> 01:33:20.503
LAURA: No, I'm okay right now. Thanks, Mom. This
is the body; this is what I was talking about with

01:33:20.503 --> 01:33:23.186
the tendrils, with the hair and stuff.

01:33:23.186 --> 01:33:25.262
MATT: It's pretty gross.

01:33:25.262 --> 01:33:31.061
TRAVIS: Is there any jewelry or pockets or stuff
on it? Keys?

01:33:31.061 --> 01:33:33.866
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:33:33.866 --> 01:33:35.002
TRAVIS: I'm real good at these.

01:33:35.002 --> 01:33:37.663
LAURA: There's no pockets. I already looked and
stuff.

01:33:37.663 --> 01:33:43.500
TRAVIS: That's cocked. That's worse. 11, no, yeah,
11.

01:33:43.501 --> 01:33:49.358
MATT: As Jester said, no pockets, no trinkets.
Nothing on it but the tattered robe it's wearing

01:33:49.358 --> 01:33:57.441
and its weird, somewhat almost dolphin-like
rubbery flesh.

01:33:57.441 --> 01:33:59.914
LAURA: Ew.

01:33:59.914 --> 01:34:08.022
TRAVIS: Let's pick it up. Maybe we can offer it as
a gift to the (slurping) as we make our way down.

01:34:08.022 --> 01:34:12.397
LAURA: Ew, creepy! I'll hold its hair if you want
to hold its feet.

01:34:12.397 --> 01:34:16.001
TRAVIS: Okay. Are you grabbing the tendrils? Ugh.

01:34:16.002 --> 01:34:20.622
MATT: You guys drag its body back over to the
tower base.

01:34:20.622 --> 01:34:23.251
TRAVIS: Caduceus, you okay with us chunking this
into the--

01:34:23.251 --> 01:34:24.387
LAURA: Wait, wait!

01:34:24.387 --> 01:34:25.133
TRAVIS: What?

01:34:25.133 --> 01:34:30.496
LAURA: What if it's a door or something? Why would
we let somebody know that we're coming if it's a

01:34:30.496 --> 01:34:33.652
doorway? We could peek our head in down below.

01:34:33.652 --> 01:34:37.433
TRAVIS: I meant we were going to toss the body
into the seaweed and let it have a snack.

01:34:37.433 --> 01:34:43.687
TALIESIN: I don't know if-- well, I mean, place it
next to the seaweed, see if it has any-- I don't

01:34:43.687 --> 01:34:45.415
think this is carnivorous, but it's worth
checking.

01:34:45.415 --> 01:34:46.715
LAURA: I think it's just seaweed, Fjord.

01:34:46.715 --> 01:34:48.353
TRAVIS: Oh okay, I thought it was the gnarly
kind.

01:34:48.353 --> 01:34:49.508
TALIESIN: No, it's not that kind.

01:34:49.508 --> 01:34:52.415
TRAVIS: Oh, okay, never mind. Sorry, I
misunderstood.

01:34:52.415 --> 01:34:58.590
MATT: That's okay. What's up? What're you guys
doing? You've taken a short rest.

01:34:58.590 --> 01:35:02.602
TALIESIN: How's that door that we found in the
middle of the seaweed looking?

01:35:02.602 --> 01:35:08.741
SAM: I could try to move some of the seaweed with
Mage Hand or something. (whooshing)

01:35:08.741 --> 01:35:11.987
MATT: Okay. The seaweed itself is pretty knotted
and tangled and twisted around itself. As the Mage

01:35:11.987 --> 01:35:21.102
Hand gives and pulls, it very softly releases its
hold on the other tendrils and pulls apart, like

01:35:21.102 --> 01:35:27.717
someone sweet talked a bit of it. It's still
tangled and still a lot of it there, but it's not

01:35:27.717 --> 01:35:33.329
holding taut. You imagine that someone could
probably climb through it.

01:35:33.329 --> 01:35:36.447
LAURA: Did you want to climb through it?

01:35:36.447 --> 01:35:38.965
SAM: No, but I will. It's my job.

01:35:38.965 --> 01:35:40.999
TALIESIN: I'll go right after you, too, just in
case something goes wrong.

01:35:41.209 --> 01:35:42.111
SAM: Will it sting me?

01:35:42.111 --> 01:35:44.367
TALIESIN: I don't think so. I think that they're
pretty friendly.

01:35:44.368 --> 01:35:46.343
LAURA: I'll go touch it, just in case.

01:35:46.343 --> 01:35:52.580
MATT: Okay. As you reach out and your hand grasps
the edge of the seaweed, it moves with your touch

01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:57.376
and drifts a bit. It's seaweed.

01:35:57.376 --> 01:36:00.370
LAURA: Oh, it's nice! It's nice seaweed. Thank
you, seaweed.

01:36:00.370 --> 01:36:01.545
TRAVIS: Hello, bees.

01:36:01.545 --> 01:36:06.272
SAM: I'll go down. I'll push through and see how
far I can get.

01:36:06.272 --> 01:36:13.443
MATT: Okay. You dive in and pull your way through.
Reaching up, you're now in an inverse state. What

01:36:13.443 --> 01:36:20.206
is up is down as you pull yourself below and
upward, sifting and yanking through and finding

01:36:20.206 --> 01:36:23.592
sections where you have to pull and find a space.
Thankfully, you're the smallest of the troupe, so

01:36:23.592 --> 01:36:34.401
it's not as hard for you. You begin to descend,
ten, 20, 30 feet or so, and the seaweed isn't dissipating.

01:36:35.902 --> 01:36:37.696
SAM: It's just dark.

01:36:37.696 --> 01:36:42.061
MATT: It's just dark. You have darkvision, but
right now all you can see is clusters of seaweed.

01:36:42.061 --> 01:36:50.523
It's very Poltergeist, in a way, as you're pulling
your way through.

01:36:50.524 --> 01:36:52.349
TALIESIN: Fjord, I think--

01:36:52.349 --> 01:36:58.164
MATT: About 40 feet down, your hands reach
through. The small tunnel that you've been

01:36:58.376 --> 01:37:05.149
clambering through below opens up on the sides.
You glance and look inside, and you appear to be

01:37:05.149 --> 01:37:09.978
in some sort of a spherical chamber, roughly about
60 feet across, side to side.

01:37:09.978 --> 01:37:14.600
SAM: And I'm at the top of it, right?

01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:18.820
MATT: You're at the top of it, looking down. There
are clusters of seaweed. All around it, there's

01:37:18.820 --> 01:37:24.163
plant life that's embedded in aspects of it. A
bunch of the seaweed is all coming up and tangling

01:37:24.163 --> 01:37:31.746
towards the center to create this upward column of
plant matter.

01:37:31.747 --> 01:37:37.376
SAM: That's where the roots were, and it was
growing up through the tunnel or something? Oof. I

01:37:37.376 --> 01:37:40.087
don't see any signs of life or light or
structures?

01:37:40.087 --> 01:37:41.450
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:37:41.450 --> 01:37:44.469
SAM: Oh, I'm terrible with this. 18!

01:37:44.469 --> 01:37:55.937
MATT: Taking a moment, very carefully, eyeing the
space, no signs of life. Oh!

01:37:55.937 --> 01:37:58.881
SAM: What? What was that?

01:37:58.881 --> 01:38:00.989
MATT: Two little fish.

01:38:00.989 --> 01:38:03.361
TRAVIS: (chomping)

01:38:03.361 --> 01:38:06.188
SAM: (screaming)

01:38:06.188 --> 01:38:08.630
MARISHA: They're this big.

01:38:08.630 --> 01:38:11.942
SAM: They went for my jugular.

01:38:11.942 --> 01:38:13.738
TRAVIS: They're very smart.

01:38:13.738 --> 01:38:21.468
MATT: Roll initiative against the death minnows.
Yeah, the place looks relatively empty beyond the

01:38:21.468 --> 01:38:23.222
plant life that exists there.

01:38:23.222 --> 01:38:30.300
SAM: I'll take out my wire and make a little phone
call. Come in, Caleb, hello. Will you let the

01:38:30.301 --> 01:38:36.531
group know that it's a 40-foot climb through dark
grossness, and then there's a chamber down here.

01:38:36.531 --> 01:38:38.035
You can reply to this message.

01:38:38.035 --> 01:38:41.179
LIAM: You would advise coming?

01:38:41.179 --> 01:38:46.892
SAM: I don't want to go back through it again, so
I'm going to stick down here. If you guys want to

01:38:46.892 --> 01:38:50.678
come, just come. You can reply to this message.

01:38:50.678 --> 01:38:59.259
LIAM: She wants us to rally below. It is gross on
the way down, but okay-ish.

01:38:59.259 --> 01:39:00.990
LAURA: Gross how?

01:39:00.990 --> 01:39:02.781
LIAM: I crawl down.

01:39:02.781 --> 01:39:04.549
MATT: There you go.

01:39:04.549 --> 01:39:06.647
TRAVIS and LAURA: I follow.

01:39:06.647 --> 01:39:12.459
MATT: Everybody follows? You all head down. It's a
slimy climb. Since you're all a little larger than

01:39:12.459 --> 01:39:17.396
Nott, especially Yasha, there's a bit of
difficulty in pulling through. At some points,

01:39:17.396 --> 01:39:20.621
Yasha angrily tears bits apart and starts making
her way down.

01:39:20.622 --> 01:39:21.762
TALIESIN: Sorry.

01:39:21.762 --> 01:39:28.067
MATT: You all eventually manage to clamber
through, slipping into the lower chamber. All of

01:39:28.068 --> 01:39:35.629
you get to see this large, spherical chamber where
the wrapping seaweed spirals upward to fill that

01:39:35.629 --> 01:39:42.025
space. The structure is semi-familiar in size and
design to you, Fjord.

01:39:42.025 --> 01:39:48.048
TRAVIS: I've seen a place like this once before,
when we were in the temple previously with

01:39:48.048 --> 01:39:55.584
Avantika. If you will help me, you could search
the floors and the walls for any sort of recessed

01:39:55.584 --> 01:39:58.905
sphere shape.

01:39:58.905 --> 01:40:02.587
LAURA: (stage whisper) This whole thing is a
recessed sphere shape, Fjord!

01:40:02.587 --> 01:40:06.922
TRAVIS: I think it needs to be about yay big.

01:40:06.922 --> 01:40:08.947
TALIESIN: I'm casting Light.

01:40:08.948 --> 01:40:11.810
MATT: Light fills the space. You can now see.

01:40:11.810 --> 01:40:17.779
SAM: Last time you went down into one of these, we
had to make a very quick exit. Do we have a plan

01:40:17.779 --> 01:40:19.827
for making a very quick exit?

01:40:19.827 --> 01:40:23.711
TRAVIS: Well, if we find we something that looks
like the previous situation, then maybe we could

01:40:23.711 --> 01:40:27.849
send some of us out of here before we put the key
in the lock.

01:40:27.849 --> 01:40:32.308
LAURA: Will the key in the lock release the
(clicking tongue)?

01:40:32.308 --> 01:40:42.565
TRAVIS: No. As far we know. I don't think it
will.

01:40:42.565 --> 01:40:45.431
TALIESIN: I can cast Water Walk if we have to.

01:40:45.431 --> 01:40:54.849
MARISHA: Yeah, I have a weird question because you
became a champion after-- well, you became a

01:40:54.850 --> 01:41:04.160
champion, and Avantika was a champion. When
Avantika died, someone else become the champion?

01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:09.233
TRAVIS: I don't think so. I think it's to get the
three spheres in the three temples. She did hers

01:41:09.234 --> 01:41:18.521
and died. I have the second and the third, but
that's my logic. I must concede, I don't know how

01:41:18.521 --> 01:41:22.599
many temples there are. I'm only going off of that
art that we saw in the temple.

01:41:22.599 --> 01:41:29.579
LAURA: There were three in the art, and there were
three balls, and you got the two balls.

01:41:29.579 --> 01:41:31.449
SAM: This is ball three?

01:41:31.449 --> 01:41:33.306
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Ball two.

01:41:33.306 --> 01:41:37.772
TRAVIS: Now, unless there's two holes in here.
There should only be one, in theory.

01:41:37.773 --> 01:41:39.338
TALIESIN: I'm taking a long look around during
this.

01:41:39.338 --> 01:41:42.199
SAM: Ball two? Wait. You have two in you.

01:41:42.199 --> 01:41:44.460
MATT: Are you looking in the space? Make a
perception check.

01:41:44.460 --> 01:41:46.179
LAURA: He's holding two keys, basically.

01:41:46.179 --> 01:41:51.158
MARISHA: He got one ball. We put in one ball. We
got another ball. He has two balls.

01:41:51.158 --> 01:41:52.078
TALIESIN: Ten.

01:41:52.078 --> 01:41:54.492
MARISHA: And we're about to put another ball in
there.

01:41:54.492 --> 01:41:59.718
MATT: A lot of plant. A lot of plant matter. A bit
of stone.

01:41:59.718 --> 01:42:06.744
LIAM: There is no guarantee there is another
temple somewhere, with another person with dreams

01:42:06.744 --> 01:42:11.620
like you and Avantika, who has already done this?
This could be the final piece of the puzzle, if we

01:42:11.620 --> 01:42:19.068
understand the carvings we saw correctly, even. We
don't actually know, do we?

01:42:19.068 --> 01:42:21.877
TRAVIS: No.

01:42:21.877 --> 01:42:27.326
LAURA: Could you ask your god? Could you ask him?

01:42:27.326 --> 01:42:29.238
TRAVIS: How do I do that, Jester?

01:42:29.238 --> 01:42:31.449
LAURA: Well, do it like I do to the Traveler--

01:42:31.449 --> 01:42:34.235
TRAVIS: Does he answer you when you talk to him?

01:42:34.235 --> 01:42:35.320
LAURA: Yeah.

01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:36.629
TRAVIS: He does?

01:42:36.629 --> 01:42:38.410
LIAM: I'm going to start looking around.

01:42:38.410 --> 01:42:39.385
LAURA: Hey, Traveler!

01:42:39.385 --> 01:42:41.119
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:42:41.119 --> 01:42:43.639
LAURA: Yeah, he totally just said, "What's up."

01:42:43.639 --> 01:42:51.035
TRAVIS: Would you ask him if he knows anything
about this?

01:42:51.035 --> 01:42:55.210
LAURA: Hey Traveler, have you heard anything about
this weirdo Uk'otoa guy?

01:42:55.210 --> 01:42:59.800
SAM, TALIESIN, and LAURA: (whispers) Uk'otoa.

01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:01.468
MATT: (whispers) "Uk'otoa."

01:43:01.468 --> 01:43:06.428
LAURA: He has heard about as much as we have.

01:43:06.428 --> 01:43:12.305
(laughter)

01:43:12.305 --> 01:43:13.904
MATT: What did you roll?

01:43:13.904 --> 01:43:14.578
LIAM: 27.

01:43:14.578 --> 01:43:22.667
MATT: 27 investigation. A few things catch your
eye. As you're all having this conversation, Caleb

01:43:22.667 --> 01:43:27.972
dives towards the bottom and begins rummaging
through the base of the seaweed to look on the

01:43:27.972 --> 01:43:30.284
base. The first thing you notice is there's a
skeleton.

01:43:30.284 --> 01:43:31.065
SAM: A skeleton?

01:43:31.065 --> 01:43:36.241
MATT: Yes. A skeleton that is wrapped in leather
armor. The bones of the skeleton, you could see a

01:43:36.241 --> 01:43:45.248
lot of mineral deposits have gathered around it,
where the skeleton looks weirdly swollen. A lot of

01:43:45.248 --> 01:43:51.530
buildup on it, like you've seen those sunken ships
that look lumpy. You find that. The leather armor

01:43:51.530 --> 01:43:58.867
is pristine, but the skeleton is fucked. You also
see, clustered around the base there, numbers of

01:43:58.868 --> 01:44:05.748
small, shiny bits of material that the light that
Caduceus had cast is refracting off it, coins:

01:44:05.748 --> 01:44:16.168
gold, platinum, copper, silver. You look and
rummage in the one side. You find a glass vial

01:44:16.168 --> 01:44:23.367
that is tangled in weeds that has a dull,
swirling, blue-gray color to it that's thick. You

01:44:23.368 --> 01:44:33.082
pull it out, and it's still stopped and kept. You
full-on Terminator-scanned the base of this area.

01:44:33.082 --> 01:44:38.789
You glance over, and other people are watching
Caleb as he starts rummaging through and finding

01:44:38.789 --> 01:44:47.144
there is a collection down here. There is a
six-inch-wide, thick glass sphere that appears to

01:44:47.145 --> 01:44:50.548
be empty that's resting on the ground as well.

01:44:50.548 --> 01:44:53.209
LIAM: An empty, standalone sphere?

01:44:53.209 --> 01:45:01.479
MATT: Yeah. It was rolled into and wrapped around
by some of the local plant life. You do see as

01:45:01.479 --> 01:45:08.488
well a small, green piece of stone, carved to look
like a feather almost, but it's made of a deep

01:45:08.488 --> 01:45:17.008
jade or green stone, and a small piece of agate
stone that catches your eye, mostly covered in

01:45:17.008 --> 01:45:20.103
grime. You rub off and polish it. You can see the
agate stone from beneath it.

01:45:20.103 --> 01:45:22.347
LIAM: Agate, A-G-A-T-E?

01:45:22.347 --> 01:45:23.831
SAM: Is someone writing this stuff down?

01:45:23.831 --> 01:45:25.358
MARISHA: I'm about to do that.

01:45:25.358 --> 01:45:31.637
LIAM: Potion, sphere, feather-shaped stone, and an
agate stone.

01:45:31.637 --> 01:45:33.795
MATT: Agate stone, skeleton.

01:45:33.795 --> 01:45:35.678
LIAM: That's four things. Plus the coins.

01:45:35.678 --> 01:45:39.983
TRAVIS: I don't know what agate is. What does
agate look like?

01:45:39.983 --> 01:45:41.359
MATT: I'll show you.

01:45:41.359 --> 01:45:42.920
LAURA: It's brownish.

01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:44.999
SAM: Do you have it all, Marisha?

01:45:44.999 --> 01:45:47.827
MARISHA: Yeah. The feather was--

01:45:47.828 --> 01:45:51.308
LIAM: It's a stone shaped like a feather.

01:45:51.308 --> 01:45:58.180
LAURA: I gave you some agate dice. Those little
ones that I gave you, those were green agate.

01:45:58.180 --> 01:46:00.282
SAM: I don't remember.

01:46:00.282 --> 01:46:09.259
MATT: And plenty of coins. As you are rummaging
through the coins, and you shift through where the

01:46:09.259 --> 01:46:15.248
glass sphere was, it rolls off the side. Beneath
where it settles with much of the coins, you can

01:46:15.248 --> 01:46:20.626
see a lot of coins are filling the space, but
there's a little bit of a divot, roughly about the

01:46:20.627 --> 01:46:23.804
size of half a fist, in the floor.

01:46:23.804 --> 01:46:28.839
LIAM: Does it look like this sphere that I've
found is the same shape as this?

01:46:28.839 --> 01:46:34.076
MATT: No. The sphere that you found is larger. It
wouldn't fit. It was resting in the space. It has

01:46:34.302 --> 01:46:35.996
grime around it. You rub it off a bit.

01:46:35.996 --> 01:46:37.537
TRAVIS: It's a see-through glass, or is the same
color?

01:46:37.537 --> 01:46:38.521
MATT: It's a see-through glass.

01:46:38.521 --> 01:46:43.366
LIAM: I will alert everyone that this stuff it
down here. I gathered up all of the things that

01:46:43.539 --> 01:46:44.367
are not coins.

01:46:44.368 --> 01:46:45.726
LAURA: Oh look, coins!

01:46:45.726 --> 01:46:46.866
MATT: The skeleton as well?

01:46:46.867 --> 01:46:47.559
LIAM: No.

01:46:47.559 --> 01:46:49.994
LAURA: What is that armor?

01:46:49.994 --> 01:46:52.057
SAM: We're picking up coins, Matt.

01:46:52.057 --> 01:46:56.928
MATT: Okay. You guys start gathering and shoveling
coins into your pockets and pouches and

01:46:56.928 --> 01:47:04.382
everything. Both of you guys, make investigation
checks for me to glean how much you can find

01:47:04.382 --> 01:47:06.309
amongst the tangled seaweed.

01:47:06.310 --> 01:47:07.626
SAM: 25.

01:47:07.626 --> 01:47:08.726
LAURA: 11.

01:47:08.726 --> 01:47:17.218
(inaudible murmuring)

01:47:17.218 --> 01:47:18.501
SAM: Keep going.

01:47:18.502 --> 01:47:22.639
LAURA: How much money did we find?

01:47:22.639 --> 01:47:28.196
MATT: How long are you taking? Are you going until
you can't find any more? It would take you about

01:47:28.196 --> 01:47:30.173
15 minutes to do it. It's a lot of coins.

01:47:30.173 --> 01:47:32.181
SAM: Five minutes.

01:47:32.181 --> 01:47:38.036
LAURA: I'm going to keep going. I mean, as long as
everybody is hanging around talking, I'm going to

01:47:38.037 --> 01:47:39.191
keep searching.

01:47:39.191 --> 01:47:41.260
MATT: Okay. You guys keep searching. What are the
rest of you doing?

01:47:41.260 --> 01:47:44.033
MARISHA: Caleb, are you going to Identify these
things?

01:47:44.033 --> 01:47:46.177
LIAM: Are we going to take the time do that now?

01:47:46.177 --> 01:47:52.897
TRAVIS: Well, I figured we're in a safe-ish space.
I don't know. We can do it on the ship.

01:47:52.897 --> 01:47:56.781
LIAM: I will need some time. I heard you
whispering about this bauble, so I will begin on it.

01:47:57.027 --> 01:47:59.575
MARISHA: Well, the glass sphere makes me nervous.
I feel like I heard of things like this before.

01:47:59.575 --> 01:48:02.007
LIAM: Well, if someone has seen us through it,
they already have.

01:48:02.007 --> 01:48:08.307
TRAVIS: My question to you-- oh. They could see us
through the glass sphere?

01:48:08.307 --> 01:48:15.857
LIAM: In theory. I sat down on the floor-- oh
shoot. I cannot do it now because my books are in

01:48:15.857 --> 01:48:18.535
your bag. If I take them out, they would be
ruined.

01:48:18.535 --> 01:48:20.885
LAURA: Yeah, I haven't opened it. Don't worry.

01:48:20.885 --> 01:48:25.907
TRAVIS: That's okay. We can do it on the ship.
With that crazy investigation check of yours, did

01:48:25.907 --> 01:48:29.217
you find any recessions in the floor?

01:48:29.217 --> 01:48:31.045
LIAM: Yeah.

01:48:31.046 --> 01:48:33.540
TRAVIS: Just one?

01:48:33.540 --> 01:48:35.298
LIAM: Yeah.

01:48:35.298 --> 01:48:42.641
MARISHA: Can I get a closer look at the skeleton
with the armor to see if the armor looks identifiable?

01:48:43.557 --> 01:48:51.999
MATT: The armor is studded leather. It's well
made. There's a bunch of black sediment and

01:48:51.999 --> 01:48:57.714
general slime and grime from the red plant life
that's gathered around the various plates of it

01:48:57.714 --> 01:49:02.068
that are fastened together, but it rubs off
relatively easily. It's well made.

01:49:02.069 --> 01:49:05.746
MARISHA: No iconography? No identifying symbols?

01:49:05.746 --> 01:49:08.386
MATT: Make an investigation check for me.

01:49:08.386 --> 01:49:17.949
MARISHA: Don't fail me now! Okay. 23.

01:49:17.949 --> 01:49:25.709
MATT: It looks fairly plain. As you pull it up,
the bones snap and the skull tumbles off of the

01:49:25.709 --> 01:49:31.385
neck and spinal cord. As that happens, you glance
on the inside. While it looks plain on the

01:49:31.386 --> 01:49:36.477
outside, on the inside of the shoulder and the
back of the plate, you can see faintly pressed runes.

01:49:36.477 --> 01:49:38.456
LAURA: Yeah! Magic armor!

01:49:38.456 --> 01:49:40.054
LIAM: Too clean to be normal.

01:49:40.054 --> 01:49:44.144
TRAVIS: I don't recognize that armor, do I?

01:49:44.144 --> 01:49:45.494
MATT: Not really.

01:49:45.494 --> 01:49:51.799
TALIESIN: I'm going to point out, I'd be careful.
Whatever this armor is, it didn't seem to help

01:49:52.023 --> 01:49:53.250
this fellow much.

01:49:53.250 --> 01:49:54.970
MARISHA: That's a good point.

01:49:54.970 --> 01:49:56.750
LAURA: What do you think killed him?

01:49:56.750 --> 01:50:03.491
TRAVIS: Does he look like his appendages are all
attached? Any cracks on the skull or face or any

01:50:03.491 --> 01:50:04.501
sort of--

01:50:04.501 --> 01:50:05.816
MATT: Make a medicine check.

01:50:05.816 --> 01:50:06.467
TRAVIS: Me?

01:50:06.467 --> 01:50:09.016
MATT: Yeah. You're the one who's asking.

01:50:09.016 --> 01:50:10.994
LAURA: Well, I did say, "What you think killed
him?"

01:50:10.994 --> 01:50:13.357
TRAVIS: Yeah. Hey Jester, could you make a--

01:50:13.358 --> 01:50:14.614
MATT: I'll give it to you.

01:50:14.614 --> 01:50:15.549
TRAVIS: Thank you.

01:50:15.549 --> 01:50:16.919
SAM: She's searching for coins.

01:50:16.919 --> 01:50:19.812
MATT: You each get to roll as you take a look at
it. Game the system.

01:50:19.812 --> 01:50:22.567
LIAM: Caduceus. Can you talk to this dead person?

01:50:22.567 --> 01:50:24.350
TRAVIS: Natural 20!

01:50:24.350 --> 01:50:31.894
TALIESIN: I didn't think to put that in my bag for
this particular run.

01:50:31.894 --> 01:50:34.247
MATT: What did you roll?

01:50:34.247 --> 01:50:35.678
LAURA: I got a 16.

01:50:35.678 --> 01:50:44.689
MATT: Okay. Looking at it, the lower parts of the
ribcage on the inside, as well as the hips and the

01:50:44.689 --> 01:50:50.876
pelvis of the skeleton, are crushed. You look at
some of the crushed bones, and you pull it back;

01:50:50.876 --> 01:50:56.668
you can see scrapes across the bone, like edges of
something sharp that had crushed through it also

01:50:56.668 --> 01:50:58.567
had some sort of an edge to it.

01:50:58.567 --> 01:51:03.176
TRAVIS: Maybe it got crushed by the pincers and
then crawled down here where they couldn't follow.

01:51:03.376 --> 01:51:05.357
LAURA: Oh, true.

01:51:05.357 --> 01:51:11.288
MARISHA: My brain went super elaborate and thought
that this chamber crushes people if you fuck it

01:51:11.288 --> 01:51:14.661
up. That makes way more sense.

01:51:14.662 --> 01:51:18.409
LAURA: I thought that maybe somebody sat on his
hips, like he was having sex or something, but it

01:51:18.409 --> 01:51:20.005
was too much for him.

01:51:20.006 --> 01:51:23.977
MARISHA: Oh man. Reverse cowgirl death.

01:51:23.977 --> 01:51:30.498
TALIESIN: Here's the question. Do you do this
alone, or do we stay here with you? We're at a disadvantage.

01:51:30.918 --> 01:51:37.193
TRAVIS: I think I need to do it alone. If I'm
going to risk getting out quickly, I don't want

01:51:37.194 --> 01:51:44.207
you to have to do the same. There's only one
recession in here, so one sphere.

01:51:44.207 --> 01:51:53.864
TALIESIN: Let's maybe keep a friend with Mister
Fjord. We can keep eyes on him in the chamber.

01:51:53.864 --> 01:51:56.355
LAURA: Oh, Frumpkin, you mean?

01:51:56.355 --> 01:51:57.126
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:51:57.127 --> 01:52:02.470
LAURA: Maybe you can cast Haste on Fjord, and that
way he can get away quickly if he needs to.

01:52:02.470 --> 01:52:06.928
LIAM: By the time we clear the room, there would
not be much time left to that spell.

01:52:06.928 --> 01:52:11.156
TALIESIN: Which I think it'll be fine with just
Fjord and Frumpkin--

01:52:11.156 --> 01:52:14.196
TRAVIS: I do have my mariner's armor. I have my
normal speed.

01:52:14.196 --> 01:52:20.787
TALIESIN: We could be outside, up in the top layer
of the temple, and wait for you, whether or not

01:52:20.787 --> 01:52:23.175
you need help, or whether or not it's time to
run.

01:52:23.175 --> 01:52:27.937
TRAVIS: Sure. I don't think there's anything else
to do.

01:52:27.962 --> 01:52:32.492
(background music)

01:52:32.507 --> 01:52:40.732
SAM: Don't you need someone to stay with you in
case you have to make-- What if you turn evil?

01:52:41.835 --> 01:52:43.516
TALIESIN: Do you want to be in the room?

01:52:43.516 --> 01:52:54.309
TRAVIS: I'm not going to turn evil! I'm not going
to &lt;i&gt;turn&lt;/i&gt; evil. I rub my cut earlobe.

01:52:54.310 --> 01:52:55.897
SAM: She did it.

01:52:55.897 --> 01:53:06.655
TRAVIS: Now look. I think we're overthinking it,
right? Same as before, I anticipate some crazy

01:53:06.655 --> 01:53:12.664
arcane stuff to activate. Maybe a little rumble
and a shake. You guys have been more than

01:53:12.664 --> 01:53:18.498
accommodating. You don't need to be down here with
me when it happens. If something does go wrong,

01:53:18.498 --> 01:53:23.879
that should be my burden, my price to pay, not
yours.

01:53:23.879 --> 01:53:26.447
TALIESIN: We'll see through Frumpkin anyway.

01:53:26.447 --> 01:53:31.512
LAURA: What if the chamber closes and you're stuck
down here, Fjord?

01:53:31.512 --> 01:53:37.576
TRAVIS: I don't think it will, and only because,
if Uk'otoa really wants me to do all of this for

01:53:37.576 --> 01:53:46.227
him, what good would trapping me down here do? I
have the third sphere. I don't think he's going to

01:53:46.227 --> 01:53:48.196
hamstring me like that.

01:53:48.196 --> 01:53:51.776
LIAM: You know him pretty well?

01:53:51.776 --> 01:54:00.387
TRAVIS: No, I don't, but I wouldn't gum up the one
person that was bringing me the thing that I

01:54:00.387 --> 01:54:04.846
needed to get out of demigod jail.

01:54:04.846 --> 01:54:12.875
LIAM: You still mean to veer away from all this
once we're done here?

01:54:12.876 --> 01:54:21.907
TRAVIS: Yeah. I'd like to. I don't know what that
looks like. I don't even know how that'll go, but

01:54:21.907 --> 01:54:29.576
I don't want to release a sea-snake beast on the
world.

01:54:29.576 --> 01:54:32.276
LAURA: Well, that's good.

01:54:32.276 --> 01:54:34.166
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:54:34.166 --> 01:54:42.706
LIAM: I'm going to expend a use of Expeditious
Retreat on myself which will, A, make me a little

01:54:42.706 --> 01:54:47.652
bit quicker. I would change the nature of the
Transmuter's Stone to let me see in the dark, and

01:54:47.652 --> 01:54:52.705
I send Frumpkin to glomp onto Fjord's arm and
shoulder.

01:54:52.705 --> 01:54:55.424
SAM: Better hand him that hat.

01:54:55.424 --> 01:55:00.719
TALIESIN: We'll be waiting for you upstairs.

01:55:00.719 --> 01:55:02.230
TRAVIS: Yeah, fair enough.

01:55:02.230 --> 01:55:05.808
TALIESIN: If anything starts to go wrong, we'll
try to get to you. If you're encumbered, we'll try

01:55:05.808 --> 01:55:10.046
to clear a path, and once you're up with us, I'll
bring everybody to the surface.

01:55:10.046 --> 01:55:14.442
TRAVIS: If you hear the signal, take off. You
remember the signal, right?

01:55:14.442 --> 01:55:15.099
TALIESIN: No.

01:55:15.099 --> 01:55:17.382
TRAVIS: (choked screaming)

01:55:17.382 --> 01:55:20.009
TALIESIN: I feel like that signal happens a lot,
though.

01:55:20.009 --> 01:55:21.737
LAURA: That's a common signal.

01:55:21.737 --> 01:55:24.018
TALIESIN: We hear it a lot.

01:55:24.018 --> 01:55:35.641
LAURA: I'm going to sit down really fast and say:
Hey, Traveler. I know that he's doing something

01:55:35.641 --> 01:55:44.045
for this other god guy, but we both know this
other god is pretty stupid, so if you do me a

01:55:44.045 --> 01:55:51.125
favor and watch after Fjord, that would be really
great, because he's done a lot of things that has

01:55:51.125 --> 01:55:57.765
really helped out with stuff for you and he's
going to be pretty helpful in helping me get to

01:55:57.765 --> 01:56:06.575
you later this year. Anyway, I really like you and
I really like him and I would like if you would

01:56:06.575 --> 01:56:08.857
help out, please. Thank you.

01:56:08.857 --> 01:56:11.345
TRAVIS: Can I go and sit down right in front of
Jester?

01:56:11.345 --> 01:56:12.144
MATT: Yeah.

01:56:12.144 --> 01:56:14.785
LAURA: Can I help you?

01:56:14.785 --> 01:56:16.764
TRAVIS: Well, what'd he say?

01:56:16.764 --> 01:56:20.141
LAURA: Did you hear what I was saying?

01:56:20.141 --> 01:56:23.227
TRAVIS: Kind of. You had a little projection on
it, yeah.

01:56:23.227 --> 01:56:31.714
LAURA: Oh shit, I thought I was whispering. Hold
on, let me think. I'm listening.

01:56:31.714 --> 01:56:32.437
TRAVIS: Jester.

01:56:32.437 --> 01:56:33.247
LAURA: What?

01:56:33.247 --> 01:56:41.356
TRAVIS: You don't have to tell me, it's fine. I
appreciate the sentiment. It's okay, you can go.

01:56:41.356 --> 01:56:44.427
LAURA: I really hope he does help you.

01:56:44.427 --> 01:56:46.625
TRAVIS: Me too.

01:56:46.626 --> 01:57:00.114
LAURA: Be safe, Fjord. (whispering) And also,
don't turn evil, okay? But if you do, I'll still

01:57:00.114 --> 01:57:05.538
be your friend. I mean, it's okay. You know, some
people are evil. It's okay. Just don't turn evil

01:57:05.538 --> 01:57:06.959
to &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;.

01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:09.373
TRAVIS: Or anyone else? Just you?

01:57:09.373 --> 01:57:12.299
LAURA: Really, any of us would be nice, but--

01:57:12.299 --> 01:57:12.997
TRAVIS: Deal.

01:57:12.997 --> 01:57:13.716
LAURA: Okay.

01:57:13.716 --> 01:57:18.656
(background music)

01:57:18.661 --> 01:57:20.672
TRAVIS: All right, get going.

01:57:20.672 --> 01:57:24.754
MARISHA: While all that was happening, I was
picking up some platinum and gold that I found--

01:57:25.003 --> 01:57:26.610
LAURA: That's if there's any left!

01:57:26.610 --> 01:57:28.826
SAM and LAURA: What, what!

01:57:28.826 --> 01:57:32.360
MARISHA: Combing the silt, and I've got the
armor.

01:57:32.360 --> 01:57:37.219
MATT: Oh, you've grabbed the leather armor? Okay.
You guys all make your way up and begin to clamber through.

01:57:37.536 --> 01:57:42.699
TALIESIN: I go last, and on the way out, I tap
Fjord on the shoulder. Good luck, and I'm looking

01:57:42.699 --> 01:57:46.941
forward to seeing you upstairs. I cast Protection
from Good and Evil, protection from evil.

01:57:46.941 --> 01:57:48.980
TRAVIS: I don't know what that does.

01:57:48.980 --> 01:57:50.410
TALIESIN: You know what that does, though.

01:57:50.410 --> 01:57:51.080
MATT: I do.

01:57:51.080 --> 01:57:52.749
MARISHA: Good luck, captain.

01:57:52.749 --> 01:57:55.717
TALIESIN: Just in case.

01:57:55.717 --> 01:58:01.893
MATT: All right. As you all ascend and vanish from
sight, leaving Fjord and Frumpkin behind, you look

01:58:01.893 --> 01:58:10.367
down upon the base of this interior chamber-- the
same recess that you had met before at Urukayxl

01:58:10.367 --> 01:58:18.179
beneath the temple of the yuan-ti. You can see,
now that you're surveying it by yourself, standing

01:58:18.179 --> 01:58:25.909
over it, the hints of the same spiral grooves that
all emerge from it in the similar pattern as the

01:58:25.909 --> 01:58:31.768
one you previously saw, carving up the walls and
meeting the upper area with the faint bits of

01:58:31.768 --> 01:58:40.218
runes occasionally visible along the same form of
prison-enchantment placed on this chamber as the

01:58:40.218 --> 01:58:41.977
one you've already seen.

01:58:41.977 --> 01:58:49.611
TRAVIS: I will kneel down in front of the
recession and I will look at the eye that's in the

01:58:49.799 --> 01:58:58.665
pommel of the falchion. (different voice) Let's see
what this does. And I'll place it in the recession.

01:58:58.665 --> 01:59:07.604
MATT: Okay. As you place the sword pommel down
into the center of that recess, the eye glows,

01:59:07.604 --> 01:59:17.682
glows. Your vision goes dark and dark, to black.
Flash of bright yellow light. Your eyes wince,

01:59:17.682 --> 01:59:23.784
though you force them open. Looking ahead of you,
you can see a bright yellow eye, the size of your

01:59:23.784 --> 01:59:30.236
body, staring towards you, emitting this painful
glow, the singular dark slit from top to bottom

01:59:30.236 --> 01:59:41.773
focusing and twitching in your direction before it
finds you. "Watching." You hear a deafening crack,

01:59:41.774 --> 01:59:47.173
and though your eyes are still adjusting to the
light before you and focusing intently on this

01:59:47.173 --> 01:59:53.010
eye, on the peripheral around it, you can just
barely make out shifting shadows, like tendrils or

01:59:53.010 --> 02:00:02.243
movement. Something serpentine beginning to shift.
It seems to be resisting some sort of binds.

02:00:02.243 --> 02:00:19.832
(cracking) Making gains on them. "Adapt." A
loosened tendril curls behind you. You don't

02:00:20.032 --> 02:00:28.410
change your focus, looking at the eye. You feel,
like an icy blanket, this scaly-like tail, almost

02:00:28.410 --> 02:00:35.576
as large as your body, begin to wrap around you.
The touch is freezing, ice cold, and you feel your

02:00:35.576 --> 02:00:48.875
back arch. It begins to envelop and squeeze you.
"Reward." The cold sensation overwhelms your

02:00:48.875 --> 02:00:54.464
senses. Your entire body goes numb and your vision
begins to blur once more. The light of the eye

02:00:54.464 --> 02:01:02.038
begins to fade as the cold sensation and the grasp
of this tendril becomes the entirety of your

02:01:02.038 --> 02:01:10.782
awareness. You hear a distant sound of muffled
cracking again. As the blackness claims your

02:01:10.783 --> 02:01:21.383
vision, you see a distant shape: a broken shore at
midnight before you. Waves curl against this

02:01:21.383 --> 02:01:27.432
shore, this long, protracted beach, with just a
faint bit of starlight in the night, giving you

02:01:27.432 --> 02:01:36.744
just the basic outline of it. Along that beach,
you see three points of light-- different from

02:01:36.744 --> 02:01:45.210
what your previous vision was. They're not bright,
singular points, but three focused gathering of

02:01:45.210 --> 02:01:53.060
dull lights. You glance over. They're cities,
cities at night, three of them along the shore.

02:01:53.060 --> 02:02:02.463
Beyond that, a faint bit of yellow grabs your
attention. Beyond these three coastal cities, you

02:02:02.463 --> 02:02:10.422
see a forest, jungle. You can't make out the
details from this strange, elevated vantage point.

02:02:10.422 --> 02:02:18.831
You feel like you're flying above the sky. The
light grows brighter, and it's the same tint as

02:02:18.832 --> 02:02:27.395
the eye that summoned you here, as the spheres
that you've claimed through your journey. Above

02:02:27.395 --> 02:02:34.630
that forest, you see, looming, the peak of a
mountain range. As that light grows brighter and

02:02:34.630 --> 02:02:44.839
brighter in the heart of this jungle, you hear
once more, "Release." The light gets brighter

02:02:44.839 --> 02:02:48.881
until it begins to hurt your eyes. You're trying
to focus on it, trying to will yourself towards

02:02:48.881 --> 02:02:54.116
it, and it gets too much and you force your eyes
shut. The minute you open them, you're back in the

02:02:54.116 --> 02:03:01.325
chamber. Your body is pins and needles as the
numbness begins to fade. You glance down. The

02:03:01.325 --> 02:03:07.200
yellow sphere that was at the base of your sword,
the eye, is just the dull, lifeless metal that was

02:03:07.200 --> 02:03:17.387
there when you first found the falchion. All the
runes suddenly begin to glow with that same

02:03:17.387 --> 02:03:24.598
yellow, faint light. The spirals all around you.
The stone shifts again and cracks, and you see

02:03:24.598 --> 02:03:31.799
bits of stone and leftover sediment begin to
release within the inside of the chamber.

02:03:31.799 --> 02:03:34.080
TRAVIS: Time to go. I'll head towards the tunnel.

02:03:34.080 --> 02:03:40.670
MATT: Okay. The rest of you up top, all of a
sudden, you feel this seismic activity around the

02:03:40.670 --> 02:03:42.008
base of this--

02:03:42.008 --> 02:03:43.035
LAURA: He did it.

02:03:43.035 --> 02:03:45.624
TALIESIN: Why don't we all get outside and be here
right now?

02:03:45.624 --> 02:03:47.531
LIAM: He's on his way, we should already start
moving.

02:03:47.531 --> 02:03:52.970
MATT: (cracking) A second one. You can see now--
previously, these very difficult-to-find-- runes

02:03:52.970 --> 02:04:01.024
that were filled in with bits of dust and sand and
muck that had gathered, begin to burst up and

02:04:01.024 --> 02:04:06.907
reveal the same yellow runes that you had seen
previously in the temple light up the chamber

02:04:06.907 --> 02:04:09.169
around, where the hydra battle took place.

02:04:09.169 --> 02:04:12.010
MARISHA: I look at the runes in the armor that I'm
holding.

02:04:12.010 --> 02:04:21.007
MATT: No apparent connection from what you can
tell. However, as the second impact hits, the

02:04:21.007 --> 02:04:22.793
tower (crumbling).

02:04:22.793 --> 02:04:23.940
LAURA: We need to get out!

02:04:23.940 --> 02:04:24.894
SAM: Are we in there?

02:04:24.895 --> 02:04:25.491
MATT: Yeah.

02:04:25.491 --> 02:04:27.435
LAURA: Go, go, go!

02:04:27.435 --> 02:04:30.531
MATT: Okay. You guys all begin to leave. What
order? Who's going first?

02:04:30.531 --> 02:04:33.760
LIAM: I'm swimming quickly ahead of everyone
because I'm Expeditious Retreat.

02:04:33.761 --> 02:04:35.007
MARISHA: I'll wait.

02:04:35.007 --> 02:04:36.771
MATT: Okay, you're next.

02:04:36.771 --> 02:04:38.873
LAURA: I'll push Nott in front of me.

02:04:38.873 --> 02:04:40.133
SAM: I don't need pushing.

02:04:40.133 --> 02:04:41.720
MATT: Doesn't matter, you're being pushed
through.

02:04:41.720 --> 02:04:42.893
SAM: Okay-- ah!

02:04:42.893 --> 02:04:45.504
MATT: Jester and Beau, I need you both to make
dexterity saving throws, and you as well, Fjord,

02:04:45.504 --> 02:04:48.478
as you make it going through the top.

02:04:48.478 --> 02:04:52.972
TALIESIN: What's your-- plus dex?

02:04:52.972 --> 02:04:56.396
LAURA: It's a natural one, so it doesn't matter.

02:04:56.396 --> 02:04:58.894
MARISHA: 21.

02:04:58.895 --> 02:05:00.630
SAM: What are we rolling for?

02:05:00.630 --> 02:05:02.813
LAURA and TALIESIN: No, you're not.

02:05:02.813 --> 02:05:05.434
MARISHA: Just the three of us, yeah.

02:05:05.434 --> 02:05:12.892
MATT: 15 points of bludgeoning damage as bits of
the stone knock you around. You take half of that,

02:05:12.892 --> 02:05:15.666
so you only take seven. What'd you roll, Fjord?

02:05:15.667 --> 02:05:16.826
TRAVIS: I rolled a seven.

02:05:16.826 --> 02:05:22.221
MATT: You rolled a seven, so you take the 15
points as well. As you manage to move through the

02:05:22.221 --> 02:05:26.702
space and just as, Fjord, you emerge, and the rest
of you begin to make your way outside of the

02:05:26.703 --> 02:05:33.210
temple, you hear this low rumble. You watch as
some of the rubble that was tumbling inside

02:05:33.210 --> 02:05:40.671
suddenly begin to push upward. The current of
water around you begins to change in an odd way,

02:05:40.671 --> 02:05:44.922
like there's a sudden suction you weren't
expecting, and all of you begin to be drawn

02:05:44.922 --> 02:05:51.615
towards the temple once more. All the seaweed
begins to tear loose and be thrust upward. There

02:05:51.615 --> 02:05:57.076
is a geyser bursting from the chamber below where
you once were, and it's causing this vacuum that's

02:05:57.076 --> 02:06:01.774
pulling you up with it. All of you make strength
saving throws, please, to try and grab something

02:06:01.774 --> 02:06:03.139
in the vicinity.

02:06:03.139 --> 02:06:07.693
LAURA: Oh gosh. Can I cast Control Water?

02:06:07.693 --> 02:06:09.770
MATT: You can, if you'd like to.

02:06:10.051 --> 02:06:12.007
LAURA: Is everybody around us?

02:06:12.007 --> 02:06:13.623
TALIESIN: I think we're pretty tight-knit.

02:06:13.623 --> 02:06:14.869
MATT: A lot of you may be, yes.

02:06:14.869 --> 02:06:18.538
LIAM: I've shot ahead a little bit, if it's under
ten minutes since I've cast.

02:06:18.538 --> 02:06:22.098
LAURA: Yeah, but we were just going through the
door, so we're getting sucked back towards the--

02:06:22.099 --> 02:06:24.217
MATT: Yeah, you guys are being pulled back towards
the temple.

02:06:24.217 --> 02:06:29.026
LAURA: I'm going to cast Control Water and try to
change the direction of the water around all of us

02:06:29.026 --> 02:06:32.509
so that we can push away from the geyser and get
farther away from it.

02:06:32.509 --> 02:06:37.458
MATT: Okay, I'll allow that. Don't even have to
make saving throws. As you all begin to be pulled

02:06:37.458 --> 02:06:42.228
into it, this vacuum, as the geyser is tearing up,
you watch as the temple that was collapsing is now

02:06:42.228 --> 02:06:46.837
being pulled up and bits of the stone are being
thrust up into the sky above it into the top of

02:06:46.837 --> 02:06:53.278
the ocean. All of you feel the immense drag and
then it laxes again and you turn around and see

02:06:53.278 --> 02:06:59.647
Jester sitting there, arms out, forcing the will
of the ocean around to hold tight and still around you.

02:07:00.242 --> 02:07:01.622
LAURA: Swim away!

02:07:01.622 --> 02:07:07.672
TALIESIN: Are we all going up? Let's go up! I'm
casting Water Walk on everybody, including you.

02:07:07.672 --> 02:07:13.999
MATT: All of you begin to rise up at a rocketing
speed towards the surface of the ocean. As the

02:07:13.999 --> 02:07:18.932
water passes by, you manage to all emerge from the
top. The speed that you're at, now that you know

02:07:18.932 --> 02:07:24.052
it's coming, you manage to do your best to slow
your descent and land carefully; I won't make you

02:07:24.052 --> 02:07:29.477
roll for any damage. As you all land, you hear
this (whooshing) sound as you glance over in the

02:07:29.477 --> 02:07:33.831
direction off the side of where that temple top
would have been. There is a geyser shooting a

02:07:33.832 --> 02:07:40.146
hundred feet in the air. Bits of rock are being
thrown like volcanic bombs in different

02:07:40.146 --> 02:07:47.032
directions, and then (quieter whooshing) it loses
its force and power, eventually coming to rest,

02:07:47.032 --> 02:07:52.072
and the ocean is no longer spraying into the air.

02:07:52.072 --> 02:07:54.262
TALIESIN: Let's head to the ship.

02:07:54.262 --> 02:07:55.431
TRAVIS: Where is the ship?

02:07:55.431 --> 02:07:58.759
MATT: The ship's maybe a few hundred feet from
where you were.

02:07:58.759 --> 02:08:01.113
TALIESIN: Let's walk that way.

02:08:01.113 --> 02:08:04.164
TRAVIS: Jester, I didn't know you could mess with
water like that.

02:08:04.164 --> 02:08:07.402
LAURA: Yeah, Fjord, haven't you seen me Control
Water before?

02:08:07.403 --> 02:08:08.481
TRAVIS: No?

02:08:08.481 --> 02:08:12.333
SAM: Yeah, they both made the ship go a little
faster.

02:08:12.333 --> 02:08:14.281
TRAVIS: Oh, I'm forgetful.

02:08:14.282 --> 02:08:15.932
SAM: But not like that underwater.

02:08:15.932 --> 02:08:17.871
TALIESIN: That was very nice.

02:08:17.871 --> 02:08:23.490
MATT: You guys jog your way towards the ship. You
see somebody off the side notice you and start

02:08:23.490 --> 02:08:29.000
shouting to the rest of the crew, at which point
the sails are unfurled a bit and, as you guys make

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:33.271
your way towards the edge, they throw the rope
ladders, and you all begin to climb your way back

02:08:33.271 --> 02:08:35.522
onto the Balleater's deck.

02:08:35.522 --> 02:08:39.372
TALIESIN: We really got to do something about that
at some point.

02:08:39.372 --> 02:08:40.168
LAURA: Nott!

02:08:40.168 --> 02:08:41.692
SAM: What? What? What?

02:08:41.693 --> 02:08:43.334
LAURA: We're not in the water anymore!

02:08:43.334 --> 02:08:47.672
SAM: Oh, thank god. The water sucks so bad.

02:08:47.672 --> 02:08:49.663
MARISHA: So?

02:08:49.663 --> 02:08:54.880
TRAVIS: I mean, it worked.

02:08:54.881 --> 02:08:56.661
LAURA: Did you get any special stuff?

02:08:56.661 --> 02:08:57.762
SAM: Yeah, do something!

02:08:57.762 --> 02:08:59.253
MARISHA: How do you feel?

02:08:59.253 --> 02:09:02.001
TRAVIS: Would I know if I got something new?

02:09:02.002 --> 02:09:10.062
MATT: You sense that lingering pins-and-needles
hasn't quite faded entirely. There's a buzzing

02:09:10.062 --> 02:09:12.952
energy about you.

02:09:12.952 --> 02:09:15.747
TRAVIS: Do I know what it is?

02:09:15.747 --> 02:09:20.360
MATT: It's something connected to the ocean.
Something connected to water.

02:09:20.360 --> 02:09:28.205
TRAVIS: I mean, I can try. I'll reach my hand out
towards the sea and lift up my hand.

02:09:28.205 --> 02:09:35.264
MATT: Borrowing from the imagery that you've seen
with Avantika's attempts at shaping and

02:09:35.264 --> 02:09:36.703
manipulating the waters that surround her--

02:09:36.703 --> 02:09:38.095
TRAVIS: Cleaning herself on her balcony?

02:09:38.095 --> 02:09:48.011
MATT: Correct. As you will the water to follow--
and you guys watch this as well-- it extends in a

02:09:48.011 --> 02:09:53.933
tendril and wraps up to the edge of the ship and
seems to be awaiting a command.

02:09:53.933 --> 02:09:55.614
LAURA: Whoa, you can do it!

02:09:55.614 --> 02:09:58.030
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think we're good.

02:09:58.030 --> 02:10:03.282
MATT: Orly, at this point, has rushed up and is
like, "Captain, where we going?"

02:10:03.282 --> 02:10:07.532
TRAVIS: Make for the coast, Orly. We've had enough
time at sea.

02:10:07.532 --> 02:10:08.720
SAM: Fuck yes!

02:10:08.720 --> 02:10:12.099
MATT: "All right," and begins shouting out
commands, and you hear a voice shouting out from

02:10:12.252 --> 02:10:18.820
the crow's nest, Marius LePual, "Captain! Ship
sighted!" and you see him pointing off to the

02:10:18.820 --> 02:10:22.849
side. You guys glance towards the southern
archipelago island, and at the edge of one of the

02:10:22.849 --> 02:10:27.589
cliff sides where there is a waterfall and a bit
of the forest gathered there, the front of a boat

02:10:27.589 --> 02:10:30.675
is emerging from what is a previously-unseen
seaside cave.

02:10:30.675 --> 02:10:31.897
LAURA: Oh no.

02:10:31.897 --> 02:10:34.189
MATT: And that's where we're going to take our
break.

02:10:34.189 --> 02:10:35.978
(groaning)

02:10:35.978 --> 02:10:37.025
LIAM: Can I ask a question?

02:10:37.025 --> 02:10:38.004
MATT: Yes, you may.

02:10:38.005 --> 02:10:43.528
LIAM: Watching through Frumpkin's eyes as he did
everything down below, other than hearing Fjord

02:10:43.528 --> 02:10:51.478
talk without his twang, did I see the tendril that
appeared, or was that all in his mind?

02:10:51.478 --> 02:10:56.018
MATT: All you saw was him place the sword in the
spot, there was a flash of light from where it

02:10:56.018 --> 02:11:02.098
was, and he was immediately-- There was no time
passage.

02:11:02.098 --> 02:11:06.728
LIAM: So just heard him speak and heard him wedge
a sword in the ground.

02:11:06.728 --> 02:11:10.892
MATT: Correct. We'll be right back here to see
what happens here for the next bit.

02:11:10.892 --> 02:11:12.660
SAM: Wow. That was amazing, Matt.

02:11:12.660 --> 02:11:13.629
TRAVIS: Really cool shit.

02:11:13.629 --> 02:11:18.644
MATT: Oh man, we're just getting started! We have
our fantastic Wyrmwood giveaway, so before we

02:11:18.645 --> 02:11:25.982

We'll have the winner when we return. See you in a

02:11:59.659 --> 02:12:05.434
MATT: Welcome back. Before we jump in, our winner

02:12:05.434 --> 02:12:11.704
Drinscorpio. Drinscorpio, congratulations. We'll
get your info and get that sent to you ASAP, but

02:12:11.704 --> 02:12:12.533
well done.

02:12:12.533 --> 02:12:14.658
LIAM: That was my first D&amp;D character.

02:12:14.658 --> 02:12:19.083
SAM: I forgot to hand these out at the break. If
anyone wants a durian candy?

02:12:19.083 --> 02:12:20.234
MATT: Oh no.

02:12:20.234 --> 02:12:20.936
LAURA: No!

02:12:20.937 --> 02:12:22.165
MARISHA: Like durian fruit?

02:12:22.165 --> 02:12:23.573
SAM: Durian fruit candies, guys!

02:12:23.573 --> 02:12:25.087
MATT: Does it smell like durian?

02:12:25.088 --> 02:12:26.885
SAM: Yeah, it smells and is made out of durian.

02:12:26.885 --> 02:12:27.910
TRAVIS: What the hell is durian?

02:12:27.911 --> 02:12:28.939
TALIESIN: Don't open it.

02:12:28.939 --> 02:12:30.395
LAURA: Try it. Do it, Travis.

02:12:30.395 --> 02:12:32.736
MATT: You ever see those super spiked Asian
fruit?

02:12:32.736 --> 02:12:33.423
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:12:33.423 --> 02:12:35.836
MARISHA: They smell like rotten flesh when you
open them.

02:12:35.836 --> 02:12:37.544
LIAM: No, don't open that.

02:12:37.544 --> 02:12:39.643
LAURA: You going to do it?

02:12:39.643 --> 02:12:42.435
SAM: No, it's got a wrapping on it. You have to
take the wrapping off.

02:12:42.435 --> 02:12:43.662
TRAVIS: (mouth full) What is that?

02:12:43.662 --> 02:12:44.773
SAM: It's a wrap--

02:12:44.773 --> 02:12:46.068
LAURA: Well, remember what--

02:12:46.068 --> 02:12:46.783
TRAVIS: (garbled noise)

02:12:46.783 --> 02:12:49.148
(laughter)

02:12:49.148 --> 02:12:51.498
LIAM: You were only warned six times before you
put it in your mouth.

02:12:51.825 --> 02:12:52.927
MARISHA: Do you like durian?

02:12:52.928 --> 02:12:53.634
SAM: It's good.

02:12:53.634 --> 02:12:54.491
TRAVIS: Ugh.

02:12:54.491 --> 02:12:56.253
TALIESIN: It's an acquired taste.

02:12:56.253 --> 02:12:57.025
SAM: Mmm.

02:12:57.025 --> 02:13:06.002
MATT: All righty. As you all get onto the ship and
Orly begins to make the course, you hear Marius

02:13:06.002 --> 02:13:10.315
LePual shouting from the crow's nest that there is
a ship emerging. You turn it and look towards the

02:13:10.315 --> 02:13:14.934
southern island of the archipelago and see,
emerging from a seaside cave that you had not

02:13:14.934 --> 02:13:22.236
noticed upon entry, the front of a ship, the bow
piercing the edge and making its way towards you.

02:13:22.236 --> 02:13:23.549
LAURA: What's it look like?

02:13:23.549 --> 02:13:25.492
TRAVIS: On a course to intercept? Starboard,
port?

02:13:25.710 --> 02:13:27.481
MATT: You don't know. You can wait and find out.
What are you doing?

02:13:27.481 --> 02:13:29.215
LIAM: Looks like someone who waited for us to do
the hard work.

02:13:29.215 --> 02:13:32.114
TRAVIS: No, we're dropping all the sails. We're
getting the fuck out of here, and I'm going to use

02:13:32.115 --> 02:13:35.827
Control Water to push the back of our boat out the
fucking archipelago.

02:13:35.827 --> 02:13:44.446
MATT: Okay. All right, the sails begin to drop--
begin to pick up the wind and make your way which

02:13:44.446 --> 02:13:46.293
direction? East, north?

02:13:46.293 --> 02:13:53.126
TRAVIS: North. Northeast, the way-- I imagine
that's the closest one. If there's a closer

02:13:53.126 --> 02:13:54.102
opening, yeah.

02:13:54.102 --> 02:13:54.908
MATT: Northeast would be the way.

02:13:54.908 --> 02:13:55.478
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:13:55.478 --> 02:14:01.092
MATT: All right. Making that route-- you're giving
the direction-- the sails pick up and the ship

02:14:01.092 --> 02:14:06.856
begins moving. As the ship turns around the corner
and you're glancing as it makes its way in your

02:14:06.857 --> 02:14:12.516
direction, no colors flying. Similar size, if a
little bit smaller than your ship.

02:14:12.516 --> 02:14:16.326
MARISHA: As a first mate...

02:14:16.326 --> 02:14:18.166
MATT: Correct.

02:14:18.166 --> 02:14:24.517
MARISHA: Do I get a dope first mate kit, like a
spyglass?

02:14:24.517 --> 02:14:29.604
MATT: There is a spyglass on board, as part of the
equipment.

02:14:29.604 --> 02:14:30.787
MARISHA: Can I use the spyglass?

02:14:30.787 --> 02:14:33.258
MATT: You may. Make a perception check with
advantage.

02:14:33.259 --> 02:14:36.708
SAM: Do you open it like that, or do you do one of
these (flick) and then use it?

02:14:36.708 --> 02:14:38.994
MARISHA: Oh, I absolutely (whoosh) and then...

02:14:38.994 --> 02:14:40.151
LIAM: Into the ocean.

02:14:40.152 --> 02:14:43.343
MARISHA: Yes. Argh! Just straight perception?

02:14:43.343 --> 02:14:44.293
MATT: Mm-hmm.

02:14:44.294 --> 02:14:46.761
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay. Wait, what?

02:14:46.781 --> 02:14:48.297
LIAM: He said at advantage.

02:14:48.310 --> 02:14:50.706
MATT: Yeah, with the spyglass.

02:14:50.706 --> 02:14:56.956
LIAM: Oh my god, it's cocked! You don't get to
keep it, but it was like, "20, fuck you," at an angle.

02:14:57.168 --> 02:15:01.841
MARISHA: This literally happens to me so much!
That's better, 21.

02:15:01.841 --> 02:15:07.847
MATT: Okay. As you glance off to the side, you can
see the ship. There appears to be a crew waiting

02:15:07.848 --> 02:15:15.027
on deck, scattered amongst the edges of it,
looking over. Maybe six people you can see.

02:15:15.027 --> 02:15:25.752
They're all dressed in drab, dark grays and blacks
and greens. Sails fully open at this point, and

02:15:25.752 --> 02:15:32.845
you do notice that there are gunports on it, four
gunports on the side that you can see that are

02:15:32.845 --> 02:15:34.309
being opened currently.

02:15:34.309 --> 02:15:35.195
LAURA: Oh no!

02:15:35.195 --> 02:15:36.267
MARISHA: And you said they weren't flying colors.

02:15:36.267 --> 02:15:38.003
MATT: Correct, no flags.

02:15:38.003 --> 02:15:43.245
MARISHA: Okay. I turn around to Fjord, relay that
message, say: They've got gunports! They're about

02:15:43.245 --> 02:15:44.276
to fire!

02:15:44.276 --> 02:15:50.670
SAM: Captain, Captain! Should I go under and ready
the cannons? Captain?

02:15:50.670 --> 02:15:52.941
TRAVIS: Make ready the cannons.

02:15:52.941 --> 02:15:56.291
SAM: Aye-aye, Captain! (screaming)

02:15:57.571 --> 02:16:00.638
TALIESIN: Do you want me to give them fair
warning?

02:16:00.638 --> 02:16:05.544
TRAVIS: Yeah. What's the distance from the ship?
If we had to guess it?

02:16:05.545 --> 02:16:08.393
MATT: At this point, from what you can gather as
you're turning around and heading in that

02:16:08.393 --> 02:16:14.022
direction-- because you were towards that southern
island for the place in between the three of them

02:16:14.022 --> 02:16:20.388
where you found-- it's maybe about, at this point,
2,000 or so feet away from you.

02:16:20.388 --> 02:16:21.865
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:16:21.866 --> 02:16:22.929
TALIESIN: I would say close enough.

02:16:22.929 --> 02:16:24.920
MATT: You are taking down some of the crew to
begin manning the guns?

02:16:24.920 --> 02:16:25.779
SAM: Yes!

02:16:25.779 --> 02:16:27.052
TRAVIS: I have no idea what's an appropriate
range.

02:16:27.053 --> 02:16:29.898
MATT: All right. You have the special officer
action on the lower left area.

02:16:29.898 --> 02:16:31.117
SAM: Special officer action?

02:16:31.117 --> 02:16:37.005
MATT: There's also one here for the captain and
the first mate.

02:16:37.005 --> 02:16:39.383
MARISHA: I'm so happy!

02:16:39.383 --> 02:16:43.138
MATT: With the statistics for your ship. As we are
currently--

02:16:43.138 --> 02:16:46.206
TRAVIS: We couldn't just get to land, goddamn it.
(clears throat) Just kidding.

02:16:46.206 --> 02:16:48.606
MARISHA: It's a ship fight! I'm getting
emotional.

02:16:48.607 --> 02:16:51.259
TRAVIS: Taliesin, do you have any idea what the
range on a cannon is?

02:16:51.259 --> 02:16:53.268
TALIESIN: Far.

02:16:53.268 --> 02:16:54.606
TRAVIS: 120 or 480.

02:16:54.606 --> 02:16:59.096
MATT: The cannons you have here are 120, short
range, 480-foot, long range.

02:16:59.096 --> 02:17:03.831
TRAVIS: Okay. We have seven cannons.

02:17:03.831 --> 02:17:06.613
LIAM: And they are more than four times further
away than that.

02:17:06.614 --> 02:17:08.972
TALIESIN: And I still have a Control Water, so
once they're within 300 feet, I can make their

02:17:08.972 --> 02:17:10.370
life very unpleasant.

02:17:10.370 --> 02:17:13.788
MARISHA: I thought-- was she the boatswain?

02:17:13.788 --> 02:17:14.970
SAM: You're the boatswain.

02:17:14.970 --> 02:17:15.819
LAURA: I'm the boatswain?

02:17:15.819 --> 02:17:18.396
MARISHA: I don't know. Who did the ropes and the
sails?

02:17:18.396 --> 02:17:19.284
LAURA: Oh yeah.

02:17:19.284 --> 02:17:20.773
MARISHA: Wait, I have this written down.

02:17:20.773 --> 02:17:22.084
LIAM: I'm the boatswain?

02:17:22.084 --> 02:17:23.486
TALIESIN: I'm the boatswain!

02:17:23.486 --> 02:17:25.070
LAURA: Now a boatswain?

02:17:25.070 --> 02:17:26.615
TALIESIN: We're all the boatswain.

02:17:26.615 --> 02:17:30.507
MARISHA: No, you're a carpenter. The boatswain was
Caduceus.

02:17:30.507 --> 02:17:31.921
TALIESIN: Yeah, what do you need?

02:17:31.921 --> 02:17:34.221
SAM: No, you have access to these actions as
well.

02:17:34.222 --> 02:17:35.664
MARISHA: At least, it was.

02:17:35.664 --> 02:17:39.727
MATT: The top two. The only person that gets the
bottom action is you because you're the master gunner.

02:17:39.895 --> 02:17:41.317
LAURA: Oh.

02:17:41.317 --> 02:17:43.698
MARISHA: Oh, because you're the master gunner. I
see.

02:17:43.698 --> 02:17:45.039
TALIESIN: So I can deal with the top two?

02:17:45.039 --> 02:17:46.793
MATT: Are you guys fleeing, or are you engaging?

02:17:47.859 --> 02:17:48.958
LIAM: What are we doing, Captain?

02:17:48.958 --> 02:17:50.195
TRAVIS: I am reading this card!

02:17:50.196 --> 02:17:51.927
MARISHA: Hang on, we're digesting!

02:17:51.927 --> 02:17:55.203
SAM and TRAVIS: (muttered reading)

02:17:55.203 --> 02:18:01.985
SAM: Cannon attacks deal an additional 1d10
bludgeoning damage. If the attack roll is one or

02:18:01.985 --> 02:18:06.159
two, the cannon misfires and cannot be fired
again. It's an extra action, other than just

02:18:06.159 --> 02:18:08.391
regular loading?

02:18:08.391 --> 02:18:13.967
MATT: Your crew takes care of the loading for you,
but you as the master gunner, every round, can

02:18:13.967 --> 02:18:16.335
give that benefit to one of the cannons that are
being fired.

02:18:16.335 --> 02:18:17.356
SAM: Got it.

02:18:17.356 --> 02:18:20.664
MARISHA: So we can do two of these, right? That's
what you just said? And the master gunner--

02:18:20.664 --> 02:18:22.463
LAURA: It's like a minigame!

02:18:22.464 --> 02:18:26.345
MARISHA: It's legit a minigame! It's Pillars of
Eternity, you guys!

02:18:26.345 --> 02:18:29.871
MATT: It's hilarious how that game came out this
year and this has been our adventure.

02:18:29.871 --> 02:18:31.764
SAM: Good synergy.

02:18:31.764 --> 02:18:33.263
MATT: It's helped me learn a lot.

02:18:33.263 --> 02:18:35.128
TRAVIS: Each of us get two what?

02:18:35.128 --> 02:18:39.138
MARISHA: So, the captain, the first mate, and the
boatswain each have access to two special action

02:18:39.138 --> 02:18:41.240
options described below.

02:18:41.240 --> 02:18:42.210
SAM: Options.

02:18:42.210 --> 02:18:48.276
MARISHA: Options. Full Speed Ahead, and Fire at
Will. And then the master gunner has access to the

02:18:48.277 --> 02:18:50.576
Pack the Good Powder special action.

02:18:50.576 --> 02:18:53.213
TRAVIS: Right, which is a singular cannon shot
with additional loads of powder.

02:18:53.213 --> 02:18:54.353
SAM: How many cannons do we have?

02:18:54.353 --> 02:18:54.928
TRAVIS: Seven.

02:18:54.928 --> 02:18:58.702
MATT: You have seven. There were eight, but one of
them got damaged.

02:18:58.702 --> 02:19:02.876
SAM: How many on the side that's facing our
interlopers?

02:19:02.876 --> 02:19:05.883
MATT: It should tell you, you have--

02:19:05.884 --> 02:19:08.977
TRAVIS: Four on the port, three on the starboard,
but we don't know which side they're on.

02:19:08.977 --> 02:19:10.015
SAM: Huh?

02:19:10.015 --> 02:19:14.922
MATT: Right now, because you're perpendicular to
them, you're going to have to turn to make that

02:19:14.922 --> 02:19:19.086
motion, which is how they're able to start gaining
on you. You do have some lead time.

02:19:19.086 --> 02:19:21.491
TRAVIS: Are we both facing the same direction
right now?

02:19:21.491 --> 02:19:28.311
MATT: Right now, no. You're facing where the ship
was when you got on in a southeast way, so you're

02:19:28.311 --> 02:19:32.022
going to have to turn to make your way that way,
but you can. You still have a little bit of gain

02:19:32.022 --> 02:19:33.448
on them.

02:19:33.448 --> 02:19:35.022
TRAVIS: So are they on the starboard right now?

02:19:35.022 --> 02:19:38.709
MATT: Right now, they are on the starboard side,
yes. Starboard bow.

02:19:38.709 --> 02:19:41.600
TRAVIS: Yeah. (sighs)

02:19:41.600 --> 02:19:50.346
MARISHA: Can we do each of these actions on our
turns, or one of these actions a round?

02:19:50.347 --> 02:19:55.514
MATT: Each of you can do one of these on your turn
for the round-- once we engage in any sort of

02:19:55.514 --> 02:20:00.392
ship-to-ship combat, but right now, you guys are
too far away. You choose now; you can either

02:20:00.392 --> 02:20:03.305
choose to engage or you can choose to try and
outrun them.

02:20:03.305 --> 02:20:05.474
TRAVIS: Run or fight, say it now. What do you want
to do?

02:20:05.474 --> 02:20:08.379
MARISHA: You said run. I think run's a good idea.

02:20:08.379 --> 02:20:11.221
TRAVIS: Yeah, I did, but you've already risked a
lot for me.

02:20:11.221 --> 02:20:16.957
MARISHA: I think they wouldn't be here if we
didn't have something that they want.

02:20:17.239 --> 02:20:21.015
SAM: Captain, the cannons are armed and ready!
Give me the order!

02:20:21.474 --> 02:20:26.853
TRAVIS: We'll see how fast they are. We'll turn to
flee into the water.

02:20:26.853 --> 02:20:30.766
MATT: All right, so are you giving the Full Speed
Ahead action, essentially?

02:20:30.766 --> 02:20:31.777
TRAVIS: Yes.

02:20:31.777 --> 02:20:37.799
MATT: Okay. The sails unfurl, the ship begins to
turn, making its way towards port side, arcing

02:20:37.799 --> 02:20:48.167
northeast to try and pick up the wind and begin to
gain slow speed. The other ship has turned and is

02:20:48.167 --> 02:20:53.204
making its way in your path and is gaining speed
rapidly. It was prepared for your arrival and it

02:20:53.204 --> 02:20:57.137
took you guys a minute to get everyone engaged to
go ahead and start shoving off. It's closed the

02:20:57.137 --> 02:21:02.664
distance to about a thousand feet over the time it
takes you to start, get everything ready to go,

02:21:02.664 --> 02:21:08.416
and head in that direction. Like I said, it is
smaller, probably faster, and its crew are looking

02:21:08.416 --> 02:21:11.008
to try and catch up and engage.

02:21:11.008 --> 02:21:13.825
TRAVIS: Probably faster?

02:21:13.825 --> 02:21:19.216
MATT: We'll find out. Let's go ahead and roll
initiative, guys.

02:21:19.216 --> 02:21:21.954
SAM: For all of us, or just for our boat?

02:21:21.955 --> 02:21:24.444
MATT: For all of you, and the boat has its own
initiative.

02:21:24.444 --> 02:21:26.584
LAURA: Woah.

02:21:26.584 --> 02:21:29.801
LIAM: For everybody with a thing to do? Because I
don't think I have a thing to do, so I could just

02:21:29.801 --> 02:21:30.897
hang out.

02:21:30.897 --> 02:21:32.140
MATT: Yeah, you could just hang out if you want.

02:21:32.140 --> 02:21:35.240
LIAM: I'm going to start Identifying spells. I'm
rifling through Jester's.

02:21:35.240 --> 02:21:37.442
LAURA: You have magic; you could be flinging magic
at them.

02:21:37.442 --> 02:21:38.574
SAM: You could throw fireballs and shit!

02:21:38.574 --> 02:21:39.158
LIAM: If they get in range.

02:21:39.159 --> 02:21:39.933
LAURA: Okay.

02:21:39.933 --> 02:21:40.557
SAM: Never mind.

02:21:40.557 --> 02:21:41.148
MATT: That's true.

02:21:41.148 --> 02:21:42.812
MARISHA: Do you want to roll initiative, then?

02:21:42.812 --> 02:21:45.616
MATT: Oh, the ship did well with a 15.

02:21:45.616 --> 02:21:48.600
LIAM: In six-second rounds-- I don't think we're
in traditional...

02:21:48.600 --> 02:21:54.364
MATT: You guys, however, not so great. That's a
six for you guys.

02:21:54.365 --> 02:21:57.964
TALIESIN: I still have some &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; spells.

02:21:57.964 --> 02:22:03.691
MATT: All right. 25 to 20, guys?

02:22:03.691 --> 02:22:05.324
SAM: 20.

02:22:05.324 --> 02:22:08.533
TALIESIN: Oh, that's nice.

02:22:08.533 --> 02:22:10.085
MATT: 20 to 15?

02:22:10.085 --> 02:22:11.195
TALIESIN: 17.

02:22:11.195 --> 02:22:12.983
LIAM: 15.

02:22:12.983 --> 02:22:28.610
MATT: All righty. 15 to ten?

02:22:28.610 --> 02:22:29.468
MARISHA: 14.

02:22:29.468 --> 02:22:30.874
TRAVIS: 14.

02:22:30.875 --> 02:22:34.932
LAURA: 12. I tried to eat one.

02:22:34.932 --> 02:22:36.945
LIAM: What are you eating?

02:22:36.946 --> 02:22:39.500
LAURA: The jackfruit candy.

02:22:39.500 --> 02:22:41.851
SAM: It's not jackfruit.

02:22:41.851 --> 02:22:43.198
LAURA: What is it?

02:22:43.198 --> 02:22:44.306
MARISHA and SAM: Durian.

02:22:44.306 --> 02:22:45.442
LAURA: Durian. It's a durian candy.

02:22:45.442 --> 02:22:46.493
MATT: All righty.

02:22:46.493 --> 02:22:49.803
TALIESIN: We usually get durian pastries after
BlizzCon.

02:22:50.335 --> 02:22:53.725
MATT: And then who's left, it's Yasha? But yeah,
she--

02:22:53.725 --> 02:22:56.408
TRAVIS: Oh, she got a three. No, five.

02:22:56.408 --> 02:22:58.155
MATT: All right. Anyway.

02:22:58.155 --> 02:22:59.406
SAM: Did we roll for the ship?

02:22:59.406 --> 02:22:59.945
MATT: I did.

02:22:59.945 --> 02:23:00.564
TRAVIS: 15.

02:23:00.564 --> 02:23:02.577
MATT: No, their ship is 15; you guys got a six.

02:23:02.577 --> 02:23:05.883
TRAVIS: What? The ship had a 15.

02:23:05.883 --> 02:23:13.485
MATT: &lt;i&gt;Their&lt;/i&gt; ship had a 15. All right, anyway.
The ships are moving. They're too far away for you

02:23:13.485 --> 02:23:23.104
to fire. In giving the orders to move, you guys
are managing to stay pretty neck and neck as far

02:23:23.104 --> 02:23:25.698
as travel for the moment.

02:23:25.698 --> 02:23:27.166
LIAM: To maintain distance?

02:23:27.166 --> 02:23:39.061
MATT: Maintaining a fair distance. As you head
northeast, just passing beyond the island to the

02:23:39.061 --> 02:23:45.528
east side of you, pushing outside of the
archipelago, the wind begins to die a little bit

02:23:45.587 --> 02:23:54.384
and your speed slows. So does theirs, it seems.
But it doesn't. Their sails maintain up.

02:23:54.384 --> 02:23:55.728
SAM: Their sails do?

02:23:55.728 --> 02:23:56.987
MATT: Their sails do.

02:23:56.987 --> 02:23:58.667
LAURA: They got magic.

02:23:58.667 --> 02:24:00.738
LIAM: How long is your Water?

02:24:00.738 --> 02:24:03.756
LAURA: It's gone. My Control Water was just to get
us out.

02:24:03.756 --> 02:24:07.981
TRAVIS: Mine's not. It's up for ten minutes and
it's at the back of the boat.

02:24:07.981 --> 02:24:10.294
MATT: It's been more than ten minutes since you
guys shoved off though.

02:24:10.294 --> 02:24:11.773
TRAVIS: Oh, well, there you go.

02:24:11.773 --> 02:24:14.464
LIAM: So if we maintained speed with that and
they're a fast boat.

02:24:14.464 --> 02:24:17.325
LAURA: So, we need to...

02:24:17.325 --> 02:24:18.543
SAM: Engage?

02:24:18.543 --> 02:24:19.097
TRAVIS: Yep.

02:24:19.097 --> 02:24:24.308
TALIESIN: Can we put them between us and land so
that maybe if we can ground them?

02:24:24.308 --> 02:24:30.578
TRAVIS: I have no idea. I don't have any visual of
where we are in relation to anything.

02:24:30.578 --> 02:24:33.020
TALIESIN: How clear is the--?

02:24:33.020 --> 02:24:35.255
MATT: I'll show you.

02:24:35.255 --> 02:24:37.005
TALIESIN: You'll show us? (gasp)

02:24:37.874 --> 02:24:41.865
MATT: We'll say for the purposes of distance-- I'm
putting this down because it's more interesting to

02:24:41.865 --> 02:24:44.849
look at than just a table. But we'll say--

02:24:44.919 --> 02:24:46.794
TALIESIN: I like that it's got little rivets.

02:24:47.014 --> 02:24:48.394
LAURA: I like it.

02:24:48.394 --> 02:24:49.556
SAM: You want more?

02:24:49.556 --> 02:24:53.203
TALIESIN: You can have mine. I only do this to
myself once a year.

02:24:53.204 --> 02:25:03.312
MATT: We'll say this is them. We'll say this is
you guys about a thousand to 900 feet away. Let me

02:25:03.312 --> 02:25:11.586
see, what can I use here for landmasses? Sure,
that'll work. We'll say as you're coming around

02:25:11.586 --> 02:25:17.620
here, this is the island. You guys are heading--
this is north, this is east, and you're coming

02:25:17.620 --> 02:25:29.336
through this space here. We'll use this here as
the other island as you're moving past, we'll say.

02:25:29.336 --> 02:25:33.043
TALIESIN: Captain, let's hug the coast to our
right a little hard. Maybe I can, once they get

02:25:33.043 --> 02:25:34.839
close enough, shove them.

02:25:34.839 --> 02:25:36.423
TRAVIS: The coast off to starboard?

02:25:36.423 --> 02:25:39.199
TALIESIN: Yeah. I can shove them into the rocks,
maybe.

02:25:39.805 --> 02:25:47.203
MARISHA: You want to do a hard 45-degree turn? If
we do that, if we turn starboard side, we can try

02:25:47.204 --> 02:25:50.151
and hit them with our starboard cannons.

02:25:50.151 --> 02:25:51.875
TALIESIN: Get around that little piece of...

02:25:51.875 --> 02:25:53.319
TRAVIS: No, we're still out of range.

02:25:53.319 --> 02:25:55.732
LAURA: We've only got three cannons on the
starboard side, though, if we turn to port side--

02:25:55.732 --> 02:25:57.714
TRAVIS: We're still out of range by 300, 400
yards.

02:25:57.714 --> 02:25:59.518
TALIESIN: I can't do anything until they're 300
feet away anyway.

02:25:59.518 --> 02:26:04.833
TRAVIS: Sure, yeah, let's aim to hug the coast on
the starboard side.

02:26:04.833 --> 02:26:11.969
MATT: Okay. As you guys maneuver and tend to hang
in close, making your way in towards the island,

02:26:11.969 --> 02:26:20.356
they do gain a little bit of distance. I need you
to make a survival check as you are currently

02:26:20.492 --> 02:26:28.845
leading the ship to try and avoid any sort of
heavy rocks and things along the side of the island.

02:26:29.310 --> 02:26:30.994
TRAVIS: That is a three.

02:26:30.994 --> 02:26:35.040
TALIESIN: Because I would be doing this as well,
can I give advantage to that, or can I roll as

02:26:35.040 --> 02:26:37.053
well on that? No, he has to roll on that.

02:26:37.054 --> 02:26:38.905
MATT: He's the captain, unfortunately, yeah.

02:26:38.905 --> 02:26:42.778
TRAVIS: Negative two to survival checks, y'all.

02:26:42.778 --> 02:26:45.824
MATT: Ooh. That puts you at a-- that's a three
total?

02:26:45.824 --> 02:26:47.294
TRAVIS: No. Five, yes, so three.

02:26:47.295 --> 02:26:53.906
MATT: Yeah, so three. Okay. Heading towards the
side there, pushing a little close in to the

02:26:53.906 --> 02:27:01.718
island. Immediately you hear (collision). Not
enough to damage the hull to a serious point, but

02:27:01.718 --> 02:27:10.093
it does suffer two points of slashing damage,
we'll say, across the hull.

02:27:10.093 --> 02:27:12.119
TRAVIS: Is our hull at full strength?

02:27:12.119 --> 02:27:13.165
MATT: It is.

02:27:13.165 --> 02:27:15.073
TRAVIS: Okay. I got that.

02:27:15.073 --> 02:27:20.781
MATT: Moving forward, it manages to dislodge from
the rock, suffering another six points of slashing

02:27:20.781 --> 02:27:29.599
damage. You manage to pull off the rock. Noticing
this jutting, the other ship rolls better and

02:27:29.655 --> 02:27:31.311
manages to avoid--

02:27:31.311 --> 02:27:32.820
TALIESIN: Are they close enough now?

02:27:32.820 --> 02:27:38.008
MATT: No. They are still gaining, though. They're
about 600 feet away.

02:27:38.186 --> 02:27:39.329
TRAVIS: How close do you need them?

02:27:39.329 --> 02:27:41.017
TALIESIN: 300.

02:27:41.017 --> 02:27:42.793
MATT: Are you guys continuing straight?

02:27:42.793 --> 02:27:49.130
TRAVIS: Uh-huh. We're hugging the coast. We're
going to continue in that same line. We need 480, anyway.

02:27:49.525 --> 02:27:59.768
MATT: All this shifts over this way. As you guys
continue to hug the side, they gain to about 400

02:27:59.768 --> 02:28:03.783
feet... 300 feet...

02:28:03.783 --> 02:28:04.930
TALIESIN: Now.

02:28:04.930 --> 02:28:05.864
MATT: What do you do?

02:28:05.865 --> 02:28:10.821
TALIESIN: I am going to cast Control Water, and
I'm going to shove all the water. I'm going to

02:28:10.821 --> 02:28:13.551
push them right into the island.

02:28:13.551 --> 02:28:14.803
TRAVIS: With a tidal wave?

02:28:14.803 --> 02:28:18.570
TALIESIN: I can't quite tidal wave. I can do
redirect flow, or I can do whirlpool, I think, are

02:28:18.570 --> 02:28:19.803
my two--

02:28:19.803 --> 02:28:21.972
LIAM: Well, it creates a wave for sure.

02:28:21.972 --> 02:28:22.850
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's a wave.

02:28:22.850 --> 02:28:23.470
TALIESIN: It's a wave?

02:28:23.470 --> 02:28:25.844
LIAM: That's what I was worried with Avantika
about.

02:28:25.844 --> 02:28:28.576
MARISHA: If I remember, you could do a few
different things. You could whirlpool--

02:28:28.576 --> 02:28:31.130
LAURA: A 20-foot tall wave that travels from one
side--

02:28:31.130 --> 02:28:33.965
LIAM: It's a 25 percent chance of capsizing.

02:28:33.965 --> 02:28:39.076
TALIESIN: I'm throwing them on the island.

02:28:39.076 --> 02:28:43.318
SAM: While he's doing that, Captain, should we
turn to engage or no?

02:28:43.318 --> 02:28:45.009
TRAVIS: No.

02:28:45.009 --> 02:28:53.444
MATT: So Control Water? You're too far away from
the beach to push them onto the beach itself. You

02:28:53.444 --> 02:29:00.273
have 300 feet from them, but they're still about
200 or 300 feet out from any sort of sandbank that

02:29:00.273 --> 02:29:04.792
would impact them. There are rocks in the
vicinity, so I'll consider that a little bit of a

02:29:04.792 --> 02:29:06.796
benefit to the chance of capsizing.

02:29:06.796 --> 02:29:07.813
TALIESIN: Thank you.

02:29:07.813 --> 02:29:13.627
MATT: You're attempting to capsize the ship, 25
percent chance. I'll make that a 30 percent

02:29:13.627 --> 02:29:18.597
chance. Roll a percentage die for me, if you don't
mind. As you guys watch as Caduceus concentrates--

02:29:18.598 --> 02:29:20.603
LAURA: We roll a 30 or lower, it's good?

02:29:20.603 --> 02:29:22.015
MATT: The first one...

02:29:22.015 --> 02:29:23.200
TALIESIN: Percentile?

02:29:23.200 --> 02:29:25.355
MATT: Yes, so roll-- what? Yeah.

02:29:25.355 --> 02:29:27.387
TALIESIN: I got them so the-- yep.

02:29:27.387 --> 02:29:29.101
LIAM: Three, zero. Roll the dice.

02:29:29.101 --> 02:29:31.087
TALIESIN: 15.

02:29:32.222 --> 02:29:40.013
MATT: You watch as the ocean (rumbling), swells up
and slams into the ship. The ship (collision and

02:29:40.013 --> 02:29:48.794
rumbling) capsizes and scrapes onto the edge of a
bank of heavy rocks.

02:29:48.795 --> 02:29:54.683
TALIESIN: It's just water. I'm going to sit down.
That was really tiring.

02:29:54.683 --> 02:29:57.552
TRAVIS: I'm glad we went through all that so I
could get that spell once a day.

02:29:57.552 --> 02:29:59.384
LAURA: Holy moly! That was some serious stuff,
man!

02:29:59.384 --> 02:30:02.704
SAM: Captain! Captain! They're vulnerable. Turn so
we can finish them off!

02:30:02.704 --> 02:30:04.742
TRAVIS: Make it so.

02:30:04.742 --> 02:30:06.904
SAM: (gleeful quiet cheering) Yes. Yes!

02:30:06.904 --> 02:30:11.542
TRAVIS: Turn to port. Prepare to fire. Smoke these
motherfuckers!

02:30:11.543 --> 02:30:14.325
SAM: Pack the good powder!

02:30:14.325 --> 02:30:18.592
(laughter)

02:30:18.592 --> 02:30:20.397
TALIESIN: We can also see what they have on board.

02:30:20.397 --> 02:30:22.294
TRAVIS: Yeah, after we splinter the ship.

02:30:22.294 --> 02:30:24.996
MATT: I'm going to get rid of that initiative
order that's not going to do anything now.

02:30:24.996 --> 02:30:26.803
TALIESIN: I'm so sorry!

02:30:26.803 --> 02:30:28.673
MATT: Set aside all these great--

02:30:28.673 --> 02:30:32.037
SAM: They've got magic. They could unflip their
ship. We don't know.

02:30:32.037 --> 02:30:35.123
TRAVIS: They obviously had some sort of wind in
their sails.

02:30:35.124 --> 02:30:42.571
MATT: Yeah. You gather, as you begin to turn the
ship around and watch their ship, they do not have

02:30:42.571 --> 02:30:47.912
anything to right it from being capsized against a
bunch of jagged rocks.

02:30:47.912 --> 02:30:52.272
TRAVIS: I mean, they've got some arcane people.
They'll be fine, if the can survive this barrage!

02:30:52.272 --> 02:30:55.912
MARISHA: Fire!

02:30:55.912 --> 02:30:59.300
SAM: You have the order, men. Fire!

02:31:00.972 --> 02:31:03.833
MATT: Yeah. For the purposes of brevity--

02:31:04.836 --> 02:31:06.051
TALIESIN: Oh, I am so sorry.

02:31:06.051 --> 02:31:10.954
MATT: No, don't apologize! That's what this shit's
for. That was a 30 percent chance for an immediate

02:31:10.954 --> 02:31:13.335
win, and you did it.

02:31:13.335 --> 02:31:17.033
TRAVIS: Yeah, there was a 70 percent chance it was
going to fucking fail, and we were going to turn

02:31:17.033 --> 02:31:19.043
to port and get into it.

02:31:19.748 --> 02:31:27.860
MATT: As you turn around and prepare the cannons,
you see the top half of the sideways ship begin to

02:31:27.860 --> 02:31:35.412
sift over to where the actual base of the hull and
the cargo hold is now visible at the top. Bits of

02:31:35.412 --> 02:31:40.963
the masts have snapped and are now floating with
the sails in the ocean. You can see a few people

02:31:40.964 --> 02:31:45.804
that are starting to scramble out from underneath
as you let loose a volley of cannon fire on it.

02:31:46.053 --> 02:31:48.818
You can roll those attacks if you'd like to.

02:31:48.818 --> 02:31:52.727
SAM: Sure. Three attacks? Which way did we turn?
Doesn't matter.

02:31:52.727 --> 02:31:56.354
MATT: Three attacks, but the first one has
additional damage.

02:31:56.354 --> 02:32:05.957
SAM: Okay. Seven, seven, 14. There's plus six to
hit, so 13, 13, 20.

02:32:05.957 --> 02:32:10.961
MATT: Is it all to the hull? That's most of what
you can see right now. Was it 13, 13, 20 you said?

02:32:10.962 --> 02:32:12.310
SAM: 13, 13, 20.

02:32:12.310 --> 02:32:20.719
MATT: The first two (whooshing, splashing). The
third one slams into the hull. Roll damage.

02:32:21.184 --> 02:32:24.674
TRAVIS: We're realizing the amount of hours that
must have gone into the detail of this.

02:32:24.674 --> 02:32:29.904
MATT: Thankfully, most of this was available as an
Unearthed Arcana in D&amp;D and I did my own tweaks.

02:32:29.904 --> 02:32:32.850
About an hour wasted.

02:32:32.850 --> 02:32:37.049
TRAVIS: Because I'm reading into targeting the
helm or the sails or the cannons...

02:32:37.049 --> 02:32:38.282
SAM: 30 points of damage.

02:32:38.282 --> 02:32:41.490
MATT: 30 points of damage. You splinter into the
hull, which has already taken a shit-ton of

02:32:41.490 --> 02:32:46.853
damage. Yeah, the ship's fucked. Sorry, Mike
Mearls. We tried to play with it a little more.

02:32:46.853 --> 02:32:50.128
(laughter)

02:32:50.128 --> 02:32:55.389
SAM: I want to do this fight! Maybe the cannon
blast flipped it back over again, and they've got

02:32:55.389 --> 02:32:56.725
a second wind!

02:32:56.725 --> 02:32:57.431
MATT: Nah.

02:32:57.431 --> 02:33:00.068
(laughter)

02:33:00.068 --> 02:33:03.040
SAM: I want to kill things with my cannons!

02:33:03.040 --> 02:33:06.137
TALIESIN: You're not shooting that great anyway. I
think probably this was for the best.

02:33:06.137 --> 02:33:13.228
MATT: You can see shards of wood all scattered in
the area around it, and the boat is sinking.

02:33:13.228 --> 02:33:21.510
Between the impact of being capsized by the wave,
the blast of the cannon fire, and the fact that

02:33:21.510 --> 02:33:24.941
you're so close to the edge of the island put it
in a position where it can't right itself.

02:33:24.941 --> 02:33:27.561
LIAM: What do we see in the way of survivors
swimming about?

02:33:27.562 --> 02:33:28.672
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:33:28.672 --> 02:33:31.279
SAM: Should we go rescue them? Get their shit?

02:33:31.279 --> 02:33:33.651
LAURA: Are you guys okay?

02:33:33.652 --> 02:33:36.033
LIAM: They're very far away. Eight.

02:33:36.033 --> 02:33:39.064
LAURA: (shouting) Are you guys okay?

02:33:39.064 --> 02:33:41.947
MATT: There are seven swimming survivors.

02:33:43.291 --> 02:33:45.344
SAM: The cannons are loaded again!

02:33:45.344 --> 02:33:49.205
LIAM: Do we want to grab one or two of these
people so we know what was going on in the first place?

02:33:49.205 --> 02:33:51.189
SAM: Or all of them?

02:33:51.189 --> 02:33:52.910
MARISHA: They might just be pirates.

02:33:52.911 --> 02:33:55.595
TALIESIN: Not anymore, they're not.

02:33:55.595 --> 02:33:59.336
SAM: What if it's the same thieves who robbed us
twice?

02:33:59.336 --> 02:34:01.615
(laughter)

02:34:01.820 --> 02:34:04.560
TRAVIS: They tried their hand at a new occupation!

02:34:04.560 --> 02:34:07.079
LIAM: We got a boat now, baby! This is going down!

02:34:07.079 --> 02:34:11.887
TRAVIS: Oh, I'm so glad... (nervously) No! It
can't be!

02:34:12.543 --> 02:34:17.469
MARISHA: We're thousands of miles away from
fucking Wildemount.

02:34:17.469 --> 02:34:20.452
TRAVIS: We even did another job!

02:34:20.926 --> 02:34:25.082
LAURA: I throw a rope out to one of the
survivors.

02:34:25.713 --> 02:34:27.586
MATT: Well, let me put my papers away.

02:34:27.586 --> 02:34:29.416
SAM and LAURA: Aw, Matt!

02:34:29.416 --> 02:34:32.110
MATT: Don't apologize! That was awesome! That's
how you do it!

02:34:32.672 --> 02:34:34.935
TRAVIS: Nice call, Taliesin. Nice call.

02:34:34.935 --> 02:34:37.480
SAM: Taliesin, way to break the game!

02:34:37.480 --> 02:34:46.150
TALIESIN: Yep, I'm here to fuck your shit up. I
will make sure you will never get to shoot a cannon.

02:34:46.150 --> 02:34:48.521
LIAM: That boat is as dead as a nothic.

02:34:48.521 --> 02:34:51.555
(laughter)

02:34:52.769 --> 02:34:56.452
TRAVIS: Do you want to go close and toss out a
rope for a couple?

02:34:57.842 --> 02:35:01.498
LAURA: Do you guys have magic? Are you going to
attack us?

02:35:02.189 --> 02:35:06.675
MATT: As you're shouting over the edge, the ones
that you can see, they're mostly raggedy-looking

02:35:06.675 --> 02:35:15.654
human ne'er-do-wells. They look like they've
probably been at sea for a while, skin tanned and

02:35:15.654 --> 02:35:22.953
burned in places. There is one tabaxi among them
that is the only one that's actually responding to

02:35:22.954 --> 02:35:29.546
anything you're saying. She goes, "Bring us
aboard. Show mercy." She's swimming, and trying--

02:35:29.546 --> 02:35:33.739
the water is thrashing her around.

02:35:33.993 --> 02:35:36.772
LAURA: Do any of you want a tattoo?

02:35:36.772 --> 02:35:38.207
TALIESIN: Oh no.

02:35:41.118 --> 02:35:42.921
MATT: Do you bring up all seven survivors?

02:35:42.921 --> 02:35:45.319
LAURA: Yeah. I mean, it's up to our captain.

02:35:45.320 --> 02:35:47.338
TRAVIS: How many manacles do we have?

02:35:47.338 --> 02:35:48.609
MATT: I don't know, how many do you have?

02:35:48.609 --> 02:35:51.639
TRAVIS: I don't fucking know. How many manacles do
we have? Master gunner?

02:35:51.639 --> 02:35:52.802
LIAM: 23.

02:35:52.802 --> 02:35:58.600
SAM: Manacles? I'm not on manacle duty. Fire!

02:35:58.600 --> 02:36:01.581
(laughter)

02:36:01.581 --> 02:36:02.844
MATT: Are you firing the cannons?

02:36:02.844 --> 02:36:04.070
SAM: No.

02:36:04.070 --> 02:36:05.691
LAURA: We'll keep them tied up.

02:36:05.691 --> 02:36:09.472
MARISHA: Captain, I would like to point out, the
more people we have to bring on board, the more

02:36:09.473 --> 02:36:13.141
people we have to feed, or if we don't have enough
food--

02:36:13.141 --> 02:36:16.543
TALIESIN and LAURA: We have enough food.

02:36:16.543 --> 02:36:18.424
MARISHA: We have enough food? All right.

02:36:18.424 --> 02:36:21.899
TALIESIN: That I can help with. We should,
maybe--

02:36:21.899 --> 02:36:28.484
LAURA: Caleb, will you make sure that none of them
are magic users as they come up on board, okay?

02:36:28.484 --> 02:36:36.126
LIAM: I can kind of do that. You have to get them
in a circle and keep them at bay for a moment.

02:36:36.126 --> 02:36:38.703
TALIESIN: Who can tie?

02:36:39.496 --> 02:36:45.988
TRAVIS: We'll be okay. I forget, do we have any
firearms, or did the Plank King dock crews clear

02:36:45.988 --> 02:36:48.716
all that out?

02:36:48.716 --> 02:36:52.689
MATT: Everything that was on the ship aside from
the cannons--

02:36:52.890 --> 02:36:53.964
SAM: We got one.

02:36:53.964 --> 02:36:55.172
MATT: Yeah, you got one.

02:36:55.172 --> 02:36:59.706
LAURA: It's okay. We'll aim our fingers at them
instead. Get up here!

02:36:59.706 --> 02:37:03.543
TRAVIS: It's not like they've got-- I'm sure
they're not swimming-- well, we'll see. Let's get

02:37:03.544 --> 02:37:05.090
them up.

02:37:05.090 --> 02:37:12.758
MATT: One by one, you pull the water-logged
wayfarers that were on the opposite ship. They all

02:37:12.759 --> 02:37:21.310
get back onto the dock and look particularly
frustrated, angry. They seem to be sizing each of

02:37:21.310 --> 02:37:28.142
you up with their eyes as they all take a place, a
begrudgingly subservient position, until

02:37:28.142 --> 02:37:34.941
eventually the tabaxi gets up, climbs and shakes
this wide-brimmed black velvet hat that looks

02:37:34.941 --> 02:37:40.914
stained and fucked up from the sea water. There
was a large feather plume on it that looks like

02:37:40.914 --> 02:37:50.854
it's snapped in the middle and hanging. She's
like, "Ugh. Well done. You cheated the hell out of

02:37:50.965 --> 02:37:57.043
"that, but what do you want of us?"

02:37:57.044 --> 02:37:59.183
LAURA: Why did you attack us?

02:37:59.183 --> 02:38:02.374
MATT: "Well, because you wandered into the middle
of the archipelago and seemed to be easy pickings.

02:38:02.375 --> 02:38:04.525
"What else?"

02:38:04.525 --> 02:38:10.648
LAURA: Oh, that wasn't very smart. (intensely)
Don't you know how bad-ass the Balleater is?

02:38:12.109 --> 02:38:22.595
MATT: The tabaxi, which wears a very calico fur
coloring, head turns to the side and goes, "The what?"

02:38:22.595 --> 02:38:29.331
LAURA: The Balleater. It's the name of our ship.
The Balleater. We eat balls.

02:38:31.506 --> 02:38:35.062
MATT: One of the other pirates goes up and puts a
hand on the shoulder and goes, "It's okay,

02:38:35.062 --> 02:38:39.896
"Captain. We got taken out by the Balleater."

02:38:39.896 --> 02:38:42.379
(laughter)

02:38:42.379 --> 02:38:49.503
TRAVIS: Fortunately, you found us on a day of
mercy. You have a second chance at life. Is there

02:38:49.503 --> 02:38:53.189
anywhere you would like to go?

02:38:54.172 --> 02:38:58.291
MATT: The tabaxi's eyes narrow. "Are you the
captain of this vessel?"

02:38:58.291 --> 02:38:59.965
TRAVIS: I am.

02:39:01.272 --> 02:39:03.593
MATT: "And your name is...?"

02:39:03.593 --> 02:39:05.642
TRAVIS: Captain Tusktooth.

02:39:06.217 --> 02:39:07.921
MARISHA: Sticking with it.

02:39:07.921 --> 02:39:09.493
TRAVIS: 'Til the end.

02:39:09.493 --> 02:39:11.493
MATT: "I am Captain Serack Feng."

02:39:11.493 --> 02:39:15.122
LAURA: Oh! Hey, man, it's like both of you are
teeth people.

02:39:15.122 --> 02:39:18.446
TRAVIS: That's a better name. Better name.

02:39:18.446 --> 02:39:21.262
MATT: F-e-n-g.

02:39:21.262 --> 02:39:25.173
LAURA: Oh. Well all right.

02:39:25.173 --> 02:39:32.849
MATT: "Well, you have managed to sink the--"

02:39:34.038 --> 02:39:35.346
LIAM: The Cock Gobbler.

02:39:35.347 --> 02:39:36.835
MATT: "--the Salty Criss."

02:39:36.835 --> 02:39:38.677
SAM: Salty Criss?

02:39:38.677 --> 02:39:43.573
LAURA: Did you have any treasure on there or
anything?

02:39:43.573 --> 02:39:51.999
MATT: The captain looks back over and it is gone.
It's beneath the waves. "Well, not anymore, but we

02:39:52.000 --> 02:39:55.602
"have our lives and a third of our crew."

02:39:55.602 --> 02:39:59.076
SAM: I'm sorry, what was that last part?

02:39:59.076 --> 02:40:01.042
MATT: "A third of our crew."

02:40:01.042 --> 02:40:02.014
MARISHA: Sorry.

02:40:02.014 --> 02:40:03.896
SAM: You lost 14 crew?

02:40:03.896 --> 02:40:06.787
MATT: "They're not here, are they?"

02:40:06.787 --> 02:40:11.121
LAURA: Well, they tried to attack us! Bad things
happen when you get--

02:40:11.122 --> 02:40:15.714
LIAM: Yes, they attacked a ship after a gigantic
geyser of water spewed forth from the ocean. I'd

02:40:15.714 --> 02:40:18.001
say they stuck their dick in it, yeah.

02:40:18.001 --> 02:40:19.512
MATT: "It caught our attention."

02:40:19.512 --> 02:40:25.721
TRAVIS: We planned to make our way for the
Menagerie Coast. Do you have any objections with that?

02:40:25.721 --> 02:40:32.900
MATT: They all wince at the idea. "Could you maybe
leave us on the island?"

02:40:32.900 --> 02:40:35.841
SAM: Are you wanted in a city there?

02:40:35.841 --> 02:40:37.444
MARISHA: They're pirates.

02:40:37.445 --> 02:40:40.273
MATT: "What do you think, small one?"

02:40:40.723 --> 02:40:43.299
SAM: Sidebar. (clicks tongue)

02:40:43.299 --> 02:40:46.515
TRAVIS: Excuse us a moment. Yes, master gunner?

02:40:46.515 --> 02:40:55.826
SAM: Captain, we're not welcome in one of these
towns. Maybe we could make some sort of a trade,

02:40:55.826 --> 02:41:00.873
give them some pirates that they've been looking
for, in exchange for immunity, or at least

02:41:00.873 --> 02:41:03.928
clemency, leniency?

02:41:04.259 --> 02:41:06.716
MARISHA: I have a feeling Darktow would side with
these people--

02:41:06.716 --> 02:41:07.731
SAM: Not Darktow!

02:41:07.732 --> 02:41:14.515
TRAVIS: You mean Nicodranas? Yeah, but we're
betting on the fact that they do. I think, if we

02:41:14.515 --> 02:41:19.431
go into Nicodranas, we need to be as stealthy as
possible. There's a chance they might not take it.

02:41:19.431 --> 02:41:23.082
We should probably drop them off at the island,
give them some food.

02:41:23.082 --> 02:41:26.669
TALIESIN: We can do that. It would take a day,
though. I can't really do anything until the morning.

02:41:26.670 --> 02:41:28.258
LAURA: We could give them really nice tattoos.

02:41:28.258 --> 02:41:30.024
TRAVIS: We'll go into Nicodranas stealthily.

02:41:30.024 --> 02:41:33.422
LIAM: We could try to turn them in, and they could
take them and us at the same time.

02:41:33.422 --> 02:41:37.457
TRAVIS: That's my fear. I like the way you're
thinking.

02:41:37.457 --> 02:41:41.552
TALIESIN: It could also give you a second to go
and take a look at the wreck of that ship, maybe.

02:41:41.553 --> 02:41:43.404
I mean, you can swim.

02:41:43.404 --> 02:41:44.540
TRAVIS: I can.

02:41:48.190 --> 02:41:51.453
TALIESIN: You not feeling it?

02:41:51.654 --> 02:41:59.345
TRAVIS: I don't know if I want to risk it. Orly,
make for the shore of the nearest archipelago coast.

02:41:59.346 --> 02:42:05.670
MATT: "Aye aye, captain." The ship begins to make
its way towards the edge. Since you're not in the

02:42:05.670 --> 02:42:10.406
middle of a rush here, you take some time to find
what looks like the way to get close to the beach.

02:42:10.406 --> 02:42:14.072
Are you lending them a rowboat or tossing them
into the ocean?

02:42:14.072 --> 02:42:15.856
TRAVIS: Yeah, just going in. No rowboat.

02:42:15.856 --> 02:42:17.262
MATT: (splashing)

02:42:17.262 --> 02:42:22.567
LAURA: Aw, but one of them I wanted to give a
tattoo to, come on!

02:42:22.567 --> 02:42:28.796
TRAVIS: How about one stays on deck, and he's
going to carry the canvas sack with some food rations.

02:42:28.796 --> 02:42:31.436
TALIESIN: Yeah, we've got some stuff.

02:42:31.437 --> 02:42:35.714
TRAVIS: In order to eat, you've got to get the
mark.

02:42:35.714 --> 02:42:38.921
LAURA: It's totally optional.

02:42:38.921 --> 02:42:41.178
TRAVIS: It's not optional.

02:42:41.179 --> 02:42:42.732
LAURA: If they want to eat!

02:42:42.732 --> 02:42:50.197
MATT: The tabaxi turns towards the four men who
haven't jumped overboard yet. "Hey, Levar. You're

02:42:50.197 --> 02:42:54.314
"up," and then jumps off. He's like, "Oh--"

02:42:54.314 --> 02:43:01.148
LAURA: Don't worry, Levar. We're all friends here.
Do you like tattoos?

02:43:01.149 --> 02:43:06.529
MATT: There's a fair canvas of varying levels of
faded tattoos that mark shoulders and forearms.

02:43:06.529 --> 02:43:08.024
They're all really well-made.

02:43:08.024 --> 02:43:09.454
LAURA: This is really nice!

02:43:09.454 --> 02:43:10.929
MATT: "Thank you."

02:43:10.929 --> 02:43:17.047
LAURA: I've been working really hard on my skills.
Where would you like yours?

02:43:20.294 --> 02:43:28.111
MATT: You can see the soaked, ratty, gray shirt.
He pulls it up, and the entire body is tattooed,

02:43:28.111 --> 02:43:30.524
from wrist--

02:43:30.524 --> 02:43:32.133
TRAVIS: How about his face?

02:43:32.133 --> 02:43:33.680
LAURA: No, no.

02:43:33.680 --> 02:43:36.391
TRAVIS: What, you don't want a unicorn pooping on
his face?

02:43:36.392 --> 02:43:42.193
LAURA: No, Captain. I have specific tattoos that
I've been working on.

02:43:42.193 --> 02:43:43.804
TRAVIS: Oh, my fault, Jester.

02:43:43.804 --> 02:43:50.372
LAURA: I want everyone who comes in contact with
the Balleater and Captain Tusktooth to walk away

02:43:50.372 --> 02:43:53.412
with his symbol.

02:43:53.412 --> 02:43:56.055
SAM: What's his symbol?

02:43:56.055 --> 02:43:59.251
LAURA: It's a smiley face with a couple tusks and
some googly eyes above it.

02:43:59.251 --> 02:44:02.574
(laughter)

02:44:02.574 --> 02:44:08.693
TRAVIS: Oh, Jesus. Well, he's covered in most
places, so pick your spot.

02:44:08.693 --> 02:44:13.914
LAURA: Where would you like it? Think about this!
Think about how cool this will be! Think about in

02:44:13.914 --> 02:44:18.811
20 years, when Captain Tusktooth is the most
dangerous guy you've ever heard of, and there's

02:44:18.812 --> 02:44:25.451
stories about him. You will be able to say: I
crossed paths with the crew of Captain Tusktooth

02:44:25.451 --> 02:44:28.363
and I lived.

02:44:31.346 --> 02:44:33.258
MATT: "Put it right there."

02:44:33.826 --> 02:44:36.683
LAURA: Oh, so you can show people and be like:
Hey, check me out.

02:44:36.683 --> 02:44:39.477
MATT: "Sure, fine, do it. Just get it over with."

02:44:39.477 --> 02:44:45.648
LAURA: You know that hands are really hard because
a lot of time, the ink, it spreads. Okay, I'm

02:44:45.648 --> 02:44:47.776
going to do it.

02:44:48.585 --> 02:44:50.401
MATT: Roll a dexterity check.

02:44:50.401 --> 02:44:52.285
SAM and TALIESIN: Oh, boy.

02:44:52.285 --> 02:45:00.625
LAURA: Oh! Oh, a dexterity &lt;i&gt;check&lt;/i&gt;. 18!

02:45:00.625 --> 02:45:07.900
MATT: You produce a fairly successful, clean
tattoo of your intended design.

02:45:07.900 --> 02:45:10.614
MARISHA: You've gotten good at those.

02:45:10.614 --> 02:45:12.844
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:45:12.844 --> 02:45:18.066
TRAVIS: Give them the food. Beau, will you show
him the door?

02:45:18.066 --> 02:45:22.204
MARISHA: Right this way, good Levar.

02:45:22.204 --> 02:45:23.852
MATT: (grunts)

02:45:23.852 --> 02:45:28.335
MARISHA: Work it, work it, work the gangplank.

02:45:28.335 --> 02:45:32.094
(laughter)

02:45:32.094 --> 02:45:39.093
MATT: He jumps off the side of it. (splashing) At
this point now, it's starting to get closer to

02:45:39.093 --> 02:45:45.234
dusk. They all swim to the shore. They've begun
assembling whatever scraps they can from the

02:45:45.234 --> 02:45:50.252
nearby tree line to start building a small camp
for the night. What do you guys want to do?

02:45:50.252 --> 02:45:55.248
TRAVIS: I actually don't need to dive down there.
I can't breathe water again for another-- until we

02:45:55.249 --> 02:45:57.007
have a long rest.

02:45:57.007 --> 02:46:04.151
LIAM: May I have my books back, please, before you
draw googly eyes in the pages? Did you already

02:46:04.151 --> 02:46:06.184
draw googly eyes in the pages?

02:46:06.184 --> 02:46:12.673
LAURA: (jokingly) I don't know, maybe. Here's
another one for you. There may be some surprises,

02:46:12.673 --> 02:46:14.052
maybe not!

02:46:14.052 --> 02:46:23.221
TRAVIS: Orly, can we set a course for Nicodranas
by way of Brokenbank?

02:46:23.221 --> 02:46:34.718
MATT: "Aye aye, Captain. If I might ask, what
business are we looking for in Brokenbank?"

02:46:35.658 --> 02:46:41.810
TRAVIS: Oh, just going by the normal trade routes,
just in case we, I don't know, run across any trouble.

02:46:41.810 --> 02:46:43.877
MATT: "No stopping?"

02:46:43.877 --> 02:46:45.226
LAURA: Why?

02:46:45.226 --> 02:46:50.180
TRAVIS: How are we on supplies? Food, water?
Anyone sick, hurt?

02:46:50.180 --> 02:46:52.524
MARISHA: Would I know that, as first mate?

02:46:52.525 --> 02:46:54.040
MATT: If anyone's sick?

02:46:54.040 --> 02:46:55.919
MARISHA: No, for supplies.

02:46:55.920 --> 02:47:01.279
MATT: There seem to be decent supplies. You
stocked up at Bisaft Isle, and you have magical

02:47:01.279 --> 02:47:03.521
means of creating food if you need it.

02:47:03.521 --> 02:47:06.177
TALIESIN: Food and water never stops if you need
it, too.

02:47:06.177 --> 02:47:07.784
LAURA: Brokenbank?

02:47:07.784 --> 02:47:12.088
MATT: Are you asking Orly? You know Brokenbank.
It's the first--

02:47:12.088 --> 02:47:14.814
TRAVIS: It's the next stop on an established
shipping lane.

02:47:14.814 --> 02:47:19.479
MATT: For many of the shipping lanes, it's the
first port of entry to give your paperwork, to

02:47:19.479 --> 02:47:23.430
show what you're bringing in, to make sure it's
all approved and going through. It's part of the

02:47:23.430 --> 02:47:26.722
process of things making their way into port.

02:47:26.723 --> 02:47:31.619
TRAVIS: If we're set, I think maybe a speed route
would be great. Nicodranas.

02:47:31.619 --> 02:47:37.958
MATT: Fair enough. He goes ahead and starts making
his way that direction. From the archipelago to

02:47:37.958 --> 02:47:41.977
Nicodranas without stops looks to be between five
and six days' travel.

02:47:41.977 --> 02:47:46.445
TRAVIS: Nice. I'll throw in some Control Waters
once every day.

02:47:46.445 --> 02:47:50.161
MATT: That'll bring you down to about four and a
half, we'll say. Yeah, between all of you guys

02:47:50.161 --> 02:47:53.264
being able to juggle that around. Okay.

02:47:53.264 --> 02:47:54.586
TRAVIS: Caleb?

02:47:54.586 --> 02:47:57.041
LAURA: Can I send a message to my momma?

02:47:57.041 --> 02:47:58.454
MATT: You may.

02:47:58.454 --> 02:48:05.372
LAURA: Hey, Momma! We are heading back to
Nicodranas. Is it safe, do you think, for us to

02:48:05.372 --> 02:48:11.556
get there? Because I know that stuff is happening,
and I haven't heard from you in a while, probably

02:48:11.556 --> 02:48:13.358
because I haven't sent a message to--

02:48:13.358 --> 02:48:15.523
TRAVIS: That's it.

02:48:16.528 --> 02:48:30.612
MATT: "My Jester, you're coming back? Well, I
don't know specifically, but there does not appear

02:48:30.612 --> 02:48:38.178
"to be a manhunt. Just be careful."

02:48:38.178 --> 02:48:43.612
LAURA: My momma says everything's okay! We just
got to be careful.

02:48:43.612 --> 02:48:49.777
TRAVIS: I think that's the plan. Caleb, you want
to take time to Identify your goodies?

02:48:49.777 --> 02:48:51.189
LIAM: I certainly do.

02:48:51.189 --> 02:48:53.969
MARISHA: I hand Caleb the leather armor as well.

02:48:53.969 --> 02:48:54.873
LIAM: Thank you, Beauregard.

02:48:54.873 --> 02:48:56.401
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

02:48:57.245 --> 02:49:04.227
LIAM: I will go back to Nott and my quarters, and
pull out the book, and take less than an hour to--

02:49:04.227 --> 02:49:06.470
there's five things now.

02:49:06.470 --> 02:49:11.949
MATT: Okay. Yeah, because you rolled really high
on that investigation check. What are the five things?

02:49:11.949 --> 02:49:17.087
LIAM: It was the stone shaped like a feather. It
was the orb. It was a potion. It was the agate

02:49:17.088 --> 02:49:19.649
stone and the studded leather armor.

02:49:19.649 --> 02:49:24.377
TALIESIN: Whoa, that's a lot.

02:49:24.377 --> 02:49:29.248
SAM: There's also some coin that needs to be--

02:49:29.249 --> 02:49:35.241
MATT: Correct. No coin from the ship. However, you
did manage to muster, in the time that you

02:49:35.241 --> 02:49:38.477
gathered beneath there, 48 copper pieces--

02:49:38.477 --> 02:49:40.555
LAURA: Between us or each?

02:49:40.555 --> 02:49:46.871
MATT: Overall. You can divide as you see fit. If
you choose not to divide, I can give you

02:49:46.872 --> 02:49:47.955
individual amounts.

02:49:47.955 --> 02:49:49.137
LAURA: No, no, no.

02:49:49.137 --> 02:49:51.233
MATT: 31 silver pieces.

02:49:51.233 --> 02:49:52.736
MARISHA: 31 silver.

02:49:52.736 --> 02:49:54.928
MATT: 323 gold pieces.

02:49:54.929 --> 02:49:56.675
MARISHA: 323?

02:49:56.675 --> 02:49:58.452
MATT: 14 platinum pieces.

02:49:58.452 --> 02:49:59.556
LAURA: Woo.

02:49:59.556 --> 02:50:02.690
TRAVIS: Not too shabby.

02:50:02.690 --> 02:50:06.106
SAM: Are we dividing it up among the group?

02:50:06.107 --> 02:50:07.795
LAURA: I think everybody gets 2 platinum.

02:50:07.795 --> 02:50:10.289
SAM: I'll do the math.

02:50:10.289 --> 02:50:15.028
MARISHA: I would like to point out that maybe we
should set a little bit aside to--

02:50:15.028 --> 02:50:16.356
TALIESIN: Pay the crew.

02:50:16.357 --> 02:50:17.719
MARISHA: -- pay the crew.

02:50:17.719 --> 02:50:22.660
TRAVIS: They die before we reach the shore. What?
No. Kidding.

02:50:22.661 --> 02:50:24.835
(laughter)

02:50:24.835 --> 02:50:26.421
TALIESIN: Wow!

02:50:26.421 --> 02:50:29.767
MARISHA: Everyone took a second to be like--

02:50:29.768 --> 02:50:32.775
MATT: In the background, from over the side--

02:50:32.775 --> 02:50:35.067
TRAVIS: He jumps over.

02:50:35.067 --> 02:50:41.105
MATT: No, you see this little turtle head go,
"Heh."

02:50:41.105 --> 02:50:44.377
TALIESIN: Jesus.

02:50:44.377 --> 02:50:51.247
MATT: If there's any other business you want to
take care of during this four-and-a-half-day journey?

02:50:51.247 --> 02:50:58.116
TRAVIS: I would. I would like to ask Beau and
anyone else that lives in the empire if they could

02:50:58.116 --> 02:51:03.668
tell me a little bit more about where they live
and who is the most concerned about the news that

02:51:03.668 --> 02:51:07.346
we received about the war moving south.

02:51:07.346 --> 02:51:18.738
MARISHA: Well, I don't know. I can't speak for
Caleb, the other empire kid--

02:51:18.738 --> 02:51:19.777
LIAM: Busy.

02:51:19.777 --> 02:51:20.318
MARISHA: Huh?

02:51:20.318 --> 02:51:21.462
LIAM: Busy.

02:51:21.462 --> 02:51:22.734
MARISHA: He's busy.

02:51:22.734 --> 02:51:24.765
TRAVIS: He's looking stuff up. You're from...?

02:51:24.765 --> 02:51:27.178
MARISHA: I'm from Kamordah.

02:51:27.178 --> 02:51:33.932
TRAVIS: Right. We came through the Wuyun Gates?

02:51:33.932 --> 02:51:35.517
MATT: Wuyun Gorge.

02:51:35.518 --> 02:51:36.619
TRAVIS: Right here.

02:51:36.619 --> 02:51:40.773
MARISHA: According to the information, they came
all the way here to Felderwin, which is where Nott

02:51:40.773 --> 02:51:42.527
is from.

02:51:42.527 --> 02:51:44.515
SAM: That's where I'm from.

02:51:44.515 --> 02:51:51.988
MARISHA: My concern was that they mentioned that
they used mountain passages. If you took this

02:51:51.988 --> 02:51:57.663
mountain passage all the way through Felderwin,
you would go along this route. My concern was that

02:51:57.663 --> 02:52:10.184
you could easily go east in that path and hit
Kamordah. I don't know.

02:52:11.750 --> 02:52:17.380
TRAVIS: Maybe we'll just see. It's at the
discretion of everyone. Once we're off the boat,

02:52:17.380 --> 02:52:26.778
I'm not the captain anymore. I don't know where
the urgency lies.

02:52:26.778 --> 02:52:32.124
MARISHA: I have no desire to go rushing back to my
hometown. I think I'd prefer to go back to Zadash

02:52:32.125 --> 02:52:34.977
and check in, personally.

02:52:34.977 --> 02:52:42.481
TRAVIS: Even with an army bearing down on it? You
have family there.

02:52:42.482 --> 02:52:46.248
MARISHA: What are we going to do to stop an
invading army?

02:52:46.248 --> 02:52:54.554
TRAVIS: Warn your folks? Get them out of harm's
way? No?

02:52:54.554 --> 02:52:59.779
MARISHA: I don't know. I honestly don't even know
if they'd believe me if I told them to run, so

02:52:59.779 --> 02:53:16.181
what's the point? Maybe we could better organize
our efforts together in a larger city like Zadash,

02:53:16.181 --> 02:53:19.258
or go check in on Nott's family first.

02:53:19.259 --> 02:53:32.677
TRAVIS: Beau, I want to honor what you've said,
but you only get one family. Are you sure that

02:53:32.677 --> 02:53:40.947
whatever's transpired between you is too much to
drop a note?

02:53:44.199 --> 02:53:54.838
MARISHA: Actually, I got a note from my parents
when I was at the Cobalt Reserve, at the Cobalt

02:53:54.839 --> 02:54:05.047
Soul. It seemed very clear that they didn't really
want me to come back. My mother actually ended up

02:54:08.607 --> 02:54:23.280
birthing a son while I was at the monastery, so
they got what they wanted. Got rid of me and

02:54:26.535 --> 02:54:37.832
thought that it would be best if we all parted
ways. I took that letter as a goodbye and decided

02:54:37.832 --> 02:54:41.308
to continue on my way.

02:54:41.308 --> 02:54:43.235
TRAVIS: You have a brother now.

02:54:43.235 --> 02:54:45.997
MARISHA: I have a baby brother that I've never
met.

02:54:45.997 --> 02:54:47.358
TRAVIS: No other siblings.

02:54:47.358 --> 02:54:49.514
MARISHA: Nope.

02:54:49.515 --> 02:54:58.848
TRAVIS: Aren't you at all concerned that he might
be an innocent in all this? He has your blood

02:54:58.848 --> 02:55:01.402
running through his veins.

02:55:01.402 --> 02:55:11.149
MARISHA: I don't know. I guess I never thought
about it like that. I never met the kid. It's hard

02:55:11.149 --> 02:55:17.697
to feel concern about something you have no real
personal connection with, whether they're your

02:55:17.697 --> 02:55:23.902
blood or not. I don't know.

02:55:23.902 --> 02:55:33.676
TRAVIS: Maybe think about it. Him, at least. Could
give the kid a chance.

02:55:33.676 --> 02:55:38.001
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:55:38.001 --> 02:55:41.575
TRAVIS: You'll know what to do.

02:55:43.541 --> 02:55:53.701
MARISHA: I guess he could be okay. I don't know.
Anyway, what about you, Nott? Are you here?

02:55:54.265 --> 02:55:56.422
SAM: I don't know. Am I?

02:55:56.422 --> 02:55:57.880
MARISHA: Yeah, I think so.

02:55:57.880 --> 02:55:58.861
SAM: Hi!

02:55:58.861 --> 02:56:00.654
LIAM: You guys are on deck, right? I'm not there.

02:56:00.654 --> 02:56:04.952
SAM: What about me? What do you mean, what about
me? I just want to get off this fucking water.

02:56:04.952 --> 02:56:08.632
MARISHA: Should we go check in in Felderwin?

02:56:08.632 --> 02:56:17.760
SAM: I wouldn't mind swinging by, if we're going
that way, just for a quick check in. I don't know

02:56:17.760 --> 02:56:23.878
what our ultimate plan is. Do we need to go to any
more ball places?

02:56:23.878 --> 02:56:29.309
TRAVIS: No, I think we're fine for a while. My
first priority was getting Jester back to her

02:56:29.309 --> 02:56:32.825
momma for a hot minute if we could.

02:56:32.825 --> 02:56:35.887
SAM: How do we do that?

02:56:35.887 --> 02:56:45.835
TRAVIS: I think we're pretty sneaky. We've learned
some tricks. Wouldn't hurt to check out the

02:56:45.835 --> 02:56:50.068
fucking building that grows and shrinks as you
approach it.

02:56:50.068 --> 02:56:52.791
TALIESIN: I wouldn't say no to that.

02:56:52.791 --> 02:56:57.995
LAURA: We are in a completely different boat, at
least. Ship. Ship?

02:56:57.995 --> 02:56:59.533
SAM: Ship.

02:57:01.181 --> 02:57:05.394
LAURA: We can make ourselves look different than
when we left.

02:57:05.394 --> 02:57:09.226
TRAVIS: If we're heading up into the empire, we
got to go through the Wuyun Gate anyway.

02:57:09.226 --> 02:57:14.697
MARISHA: Interesting point, though. We forged
papers for the Mistake, correct?

02:57:14.697 --> 02:57:16.205
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:57:16.205 --> 02:57:18.705
MARISHA: Do we have papers for the Balleater yet?

02:57:18.705 --> 02:57:21.143
TRAVIS and SAM: No?

02:57:21.143 --> 02:57:22.489
MARISHA: Ownership slips?

02:57:22.489 --> 02:57:27.726
TRAVIS: In searching the captain's quarters, would
we have discovered any sort of &lt;i&gt;papier&lt;/i&gt;?

02:57:27.726 --> 02:57:30.975
MATT: Nope, everything was removed at Darktow.

02:57:30.975 --> 02:57:34.356
TRAVIS: Yep, all right, well--

02:57:34.357 --> 02:57:35.828
MARISHA: Might want to make some more--

02:57:35.828 --> 02:57:41.107
LAURA: (singing) Looks like I'll be forging some
more. (speaking) I can do that.

02:57:41.107 --> 02:57:44.068
MARISHA: You made the first one pretty good.

02:57:44.068 --> 02:57:46.784
LAURA: Yeah. I remember how I did it, too.

02:57:46.784 --> 02:57:54.734
TRAVIS: Or we go full sail into port, crash into
the docks, Caleb sets off Fireball as a diversion,

02:57:54.734 --> 02:58:02.533
we run in and hide among the corpses of the
innocents that are scattered about. I have a problem.

02:58:02.534 --> 02:58:06.267
(laughter)

02:58:06.267 --> 02:58:10.832
LAURA: I think that's a good plan, Captain.

02:58:11.859 --> 02:58:18.216
MARISHA: We'll touch on Nicodranas, forge some
papers, check in with Mom. From there, head

02:58:18.216 --> 02:58:20.970
towards Felderwin?

02:58:21.312 --> 02:58:26.573
SAM: Fjord, do you have closure here on the open
seas? Are you good?

02:58:26.573 --> 02:58:27.800
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm good.

02:58:27.801 --> 02:58:30.044
MARISHA: What exactly happened down there, by the
way?

02:58:30.044 --> 02:58:32.054
LAURA: Yeah, did you release it or what?

02:58:32.054 --> 02:58:39.153
TRAVIS: No. I did have another vision. It seemed
like Uk'otoa was straining against whatever

02:58:39.153 --> 02:58:48.987
confines it was in, but not released. I saw a
vision of another, maybe final, temple location.

02:58:48.988 --> 02:58:50.312
LAURA: Where?

02:58:50.312 --> 02:58:56.764
TRAVIS: I saw a shore with three cities along the
coast, and then a forest beyond that. Just before

02:58:56.764 --> 02:59:01.288
you got to a rocky mountain ridge, there was a
single glowing light--

02:59:01.288 --> 02:59:04.996
LAURA: Wait, a coast with three cities? That's the
Menagerie Coast.

02:59:04.996 --> 02:59:12.650
TRAVIS: It could be. I don't really care, for
now.

02:59:12.650 --> 02:59:15.206
MARISHA: Are you afraid?

02:59:15.206 --> 02:59:18.784
SAM: Did you learn who you are?

02:59:19.755 --> 02:59:28.097
TRAVIS: No, and the thing I wanted the most was--
in some of these, I saw a vision of Vandran,

02:59:28.097 --> 02:59:37.492
whether as a statue, or in a reflection, or
something. I didn't see anything. Nothing.

02:59:37.492 --> 02:59:41.132
TALIESIN: Vandran. Hm.

02:59:41.133 --> 02:59:45.261
LAURA: That's his mentor.

02:59:45.261 --> 02:59:53.364
TRAVIS: I've run out of leads there. I don't
really know where that leaves me on that, but

02:59:53.365 --> 03:00:03.669
we've spent enough time on me. I don't have
anything else to follow. Besides, there's danger coming.

03:00:03.669 --> 03:00:08.999
LAURA: I could still send a message to the Plank
King and see if he answers.

03:00:08.999 --> 03:00:12.799
LIAM: Caleb wanders back up at this point and
starts listening.

03:00:12.799 --> 03:00:19.235
TRAVIS: Maybe we let a little bit of time go by,
but thank you.

03:00:19.235 --> 03:00:25.856
MARISHA: Are you in the slightest bit concerned
that Uk'otoa might start speaking to you and

03:00:25.857 --> 03:00:28.527
putting more ideas in your head?

03:00:28.527 --> 03:00:40.516
TRAVIS: Not yet. I feel like we're good for a
while. I couldn't tell you why. We'll see. It

03:00:40.516 --> 03:00:51.102
might be good to ask anyone if they know anything
about Uk'otoa, or if there are offsetting deities

03:00:51.102 --> 03:01:02.539
or gods. He seemed incredibly powerful, and I have
to admit I was a little unnerved seeing him push

03:01:02.539 --> 03:01:09.163
against his constraints in that way. I don't know.
Maybe there's more to be learned.

03:01:09.163 --> 03:01:11.425
LAURA: Did he talk to you?

03:01:11.425 --> 03:01:23.345
TRAVIS: Just those single words. He says things
like "learn" and "adapt".

03:01:24.275 --> 03:01:30.134
TALIESIN: Perhaps the tower, the strange tower
that grows. Perhaps there's answers in there or

03:01:30.134 --> 03:01:32.788
someone who might know.

03:01:32.788 --> 03:01:33.925
TRAVIS: Could be.

03:01:33.925 --> 03:01:41.726
MARISHA: Hey, what does your falchion look like?
Still have the eyeball in it? Is that still there?

03:01:42.140 --> 03:01:44.216
TRAVIS: Yeah. I summon it.

03:01:44.216 --> 03:01:48.452
MATT: You look and see there is still the single
eye that's always been in the middle of the hilt

03:01:48.452 --> 03:01:52.343
since your encounter with the merrow that first
found it.

03:01:52.343 --> 03:01:56.485
MARISHA: Cool, that was my favorite part. It
would've been sad if it went away.

03:01:56.485 --> 03:02:03.676
LIAM: I'm sorry, I'm coming into this midway. Am I
to take it we are headed to the mainland?

03:02:03.677 --> 03:02:05.441
TRAVIS: Yes, yeah.

03:02:05.441 --> 03:02:08.164
LIAM: Oh, that's good news.

03:02:08.164 --> 03:02:11.906
TRAVIS: Take it up into the Empire by way of
Nicodranas.

03:02:11.906 --> 03:02:15.752
MARISHA: We're going to go check in on Felderwin.

03:02:15.752 --> 03:02:24.592
LIAM: Oh, that is a good idea. So you don't mean
to pursue this any further right now?

03:02:24.592 --> 03:02:35.584
TRAVIS: No, no. And if I can, I'd like to find
some way out of it.

03:02:36.391 --> 03:02:46.508
LIAM: I was going to ask you, does it concern you
to turn away from this thing's desires? Do you

03:02:46.508 --> 03:02:54.581
worry it will abandon you? Leave you a mere mortal
again?

03:02:54.981 --> 03:03:04.459
TRAVIS: Yes, I like how I am now, and to answer
your question: I have no idea. I've only been in

03:03:04.459 --> 03:03:09.794
its favor. I don't know what the other side would
be like.

03:03:09.795 --> 03:03:14.475
LIAM: But you intend to leave the sea for now?

03:03:14.475 --> 03:03:16.095
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:03:16.095 --> 03:03:18.272
LAURA: Do you think he can read your thoughts?

03:03:18.272 --> 03:03:23.337
TRAVIS: No? I don't know.

03:03:23.337 --> 03:03:31.453
LAURA: I mean, if what he's telling you to do is
go towards the coast, that is what you're doing,

03:03:31.453 --> 03:03:36.399
so maybe he still thinks you're on his side.

03:03:43.142 --> 03:03:45.723
TRAVIS: (chuckles)

03:03:48.466 --> 03:03:51.416
LIAM: You don't even know, do you?

03:03:51.417 --> 03:03:53.157
TRAVIS: No.

03:03:53.413 --> 03:04:00.323
MARISHA: Time might be on our side. Going off of
Jester's point, a hundred years can sometimes seem

03:04:00.323 --> 03:04:08.557
like five minutes for these godly-type beings.
Maybe he'll be content for a while.

03:04:10.809 --> 03:04:18.347
TRAVIS: I'm out of my depth. I have no idea, I
don't know any more than you do. All I know is I'm

03:04:18.347 --> 03:04:29.702
ready to get off the sea for a bit. Unless I hear
otherwise, all's well. No reason to assume otherwise.

03:04:33.044 --> 03:04:34.558
SAM: Let's go.

03:04:34.558 --> 03:04:36.904
LAURA: Do you think the Wildmother can hear your
thoughts?

03:04:36.904 --> 03:04:41.112
TALIESIN: Well, I know the Wildmother knows
everything.

03:04:41.112 --> 03:04:48.435
LAURA: So if you think something dirty, she knows?
What if you're thinking, "Oh, man, I really got to poop"?

03:04:48.844 --> 03:04:53.541
TALIESIN: (stuttering) Sure?

03:04:53.541 --> 03:05:00.852
LAURA: What if you're thinking, "Aww man, I think
I smell a little bit today." "I've got a booger in

03:05:00.852 --> 03:05:01.892
"my nose."

03:05:01.893 --> 03:05:04.566
TALIESIN: Now I'm thinking about that.

03:05:04.566 --> 03:05:06.840
LAURA: What if you think, "Oh, does my breath
smell bad?"

03:05:06.840 --> 03:05:07.698
TALIESIN: Does it?

03:05:07.698 --> 03:05:09.063
LAURA: No, your breath smells fine, but--

03:05:09.063 --> 03:05:09.878
TALIESIN: Are you sure?

03:05:09.878 --> 03:05:10.903
LAURA: Yeah, you smell pretty good.

03:05:10.903 --> 03:05:15.496
TALIESIN: Oh, that's nice. Thinking about this.

03:05:15.497 --> 03:05:21.420
SAM: Speaking of stinky, Caleb, what did we get?
What's all the stuff?

03:05:21.420 --> 03:05:25.036
LIAM: I've been in the ocean for days and days.

03:05:25.036 --> 03:05:27.065
TRAVIS: He's the most sterile he's ever been.

03:05:27.065 --> 03:05:29.781
LAURA: What did we get? What did we get?

03:05:29.781 --> 03:05:37.022
LIAM: First, I want you to admit that I have been
washed from top to bottom for a month.

03:05:37.022 --> 03:05:38.512
TALIESIN: I think you smell fantastic.

03:05:38.512 --> 03:05:40.261
LIAM: You are a nice fellow.

03:05:40.261 --> 03:05:46.001
TALIESIN: Thank you. But no, really, I actually do
think you smell better than nice.

03:05:46.001 --> 03:05:48.140
LIAM: You see?

03:05:48.141 --> 03:05:53.465
LAURA: I didn't say you're stinky. Nott said you
were stinky, Caleb. I think you smell like salt

03:05:53.465 --> 03:05:55.558
and fresh air.

03:05:55.559 --> 03:05:58.754
SAM: Like a douche.

03:05:59.187 --> 03:06:12.944
LIAM: Revved up. It was very interesting. I'm so
tired. There is one of these things that I am

03:06:12.944 --> 03:06:15.073
going to keep.

03:06:15.073 --> 03:06:16.602
LAURA: What is it?

03:06:16.602 --> 03:06:18.394
LIAM: It's a lucky rock.

03:06:18.394 --> 03:06:20.805
LAURA: Oh, fun. Lucky rocks are nice.

03:06:20.805 --> 03:06:26.240
LIAM: There is another thing here that I probably
should keep, but I don't have to. This bauble

03:06:26.241 --> 03:06:32.231
lights up and floats and lets us see in the dark.

03:06:32.231 --> 03:06:35.271
SAM: Floats, like, in the air floats?

03:06:35.271 --> 03:06:36.851
LIAM: Yeah, hovers a bit.

03:06:36.851 --> 03:06:38.010
SAM: Like a lantern.

03:06:38.010 --> 03:06:42.907
LIAM: I set it floating five feet above the deck
of the ship.

03:06:42.908 --> 03:06:49.452
MATT: That glass sphere that you found beneath,
you watch as Caleb speaks the command word.

03:06:49.452 --> 03:06:54.504
LIAM: It is "tawaj".

03:06:54.504 --> 03:07:04.252
MATT: It rocks and lifts off the ground and hovers
and gives off a nice, soft, white torchlight-like glow.

03:07:04.252 --> 03:07:07.494
LAURA: Does it flicker? Is it like a hue light?

03:07:07.494 --> 03:07:09.016
MARISHA: Can it change colors?

03:07:09.016 --> 03:07:14.236
LIAM: Not exactly, but-- it's dark at this point,
isn't it?

03:07:14.236 --> 03:07:16.297
MATT: Yeah, it's probably evening.

03:07:16.297 --> 03:07:19.289
LIAM: So if I say "fajar"?

03:07:19.289 --> 03:07:27.363
MATT: Suddenly it gives off this extremely
powerful, vibrant daylight. The entire ship's deck

03:07:27.363 --> 03:07:31.193
feels like it's suddenly midday.

03:07:31.193 --> 03:07:32.282
LAURA: That's really bright.

03:07:32.282 --> 03:07:37.002
TRAVIS: And you hear (cannon firing) as we give
away our location.

03:07:39.761 --> 03:07:48.095
LIAM: Very specific use cases for that. I pluck it
out of the air, and it should dim. One of you

03:07:48.096 --> 03:07:53.976
could carry it, but since I am normally blind as a
bat, Beauregard has her glasses--

03:07:53.976 --> 03:07:56.980
TRAVIS: Yeah, of course.

03:07:57.156 --> 03:07:58.637
SAM: What else? What else?

03:07:58.637 --> 03:08:00.815
LIAM: All right, so I will take both of these
things.

03:08:00.815 --> 03:08:02.970
MARISHA: What's the other thing you're keeping, a
rock thing?

03:08:02.970 --> 03:08:04.669
LIAM: A lucky rock, yes.

03:08:04.669 --> 03:08:06.146
MARISHA: What's a lucky rock do?

03:08:06.146 --> 03:08:08.504
LAURA: It's like a pet rock, but it brings you
luck.

03:08:08.504 --> 03:08:16.456
MARISHA: Does it allow you to reroll things, like
the lucky feat? Said not as Beau, just as Marisha.

03:08:16.456 --> 03:08:18.440
LIAM: No, it does not let you reroll things.

03:08:18.440 --> 03:08:22.165
MARISHA: So what's it let you do?

03:08:22.483 --> 03:08:29.899
LIAM: This is a potion that makes one extremely
strong for a short period of time.

03:08:29.900 --> 03:08:31.147
LAURA: You should give that to Fjord.

03:08:31.147 --> 03:08:32.228
LIAM: Fjord, Yasha?

03:08:32.228 --> 03:08:33.076
TRAVIS: Fuck off.

03:08:33.076 --> 03:08:38.903
(laughter)

03:08:38.903 --> 03:08:45.319
LAURA: I go over to Fjord and hug him around the
waist and pick him up. I'm just kidding with you!

03:08:45.320 --> 03:08:47.663
TRAVIS: Ah! My back's popping.

03:08:47.663 --> 03:08:51.895
LIAM: I honestly was thinking Yasha, and if not
Yasha, then you, Jester.

03:08:51.895 --> 03:08:54.153
SAM: To make you super strong.

03:08:54.153 --> 03:08:56.943
LAURA: Well, what else do you have? I don't want
to claim that if there's better things.

03:08:56.943 --> 03:09:02.250
LIAM: I stick that into my pocket. That's just a
loaner in my pocket; I don't want it. Caduceus, I

03:09:02.250 --> 03:09:08.872
thought this would be good for you. I'm holding up
a small stone leaf. I hand it to him. Don't put

03:09:08.872 --> 03:09:15.059
that on the deck, please, because it will turn
into an actual tree.

03:09:15.059 --> 03:09:17.327
LAURA: Will it turn into a tree in your pocket?!

03:09:17.327 --> 03:09:19.904
SAM: More than once, or just once?

03:09:19.904 --> 03:09:22.567
LIAM: It doesn't say on here. I assume--

03:09:22.567 --> 03:09:23.713
MATT: Just once.

03:09:23.713 --> 03:09:24.634
LIAM: Oh, one time only.

03:09:24.634 --> 03:09:28.436
TALIESIN: We've got a tree until we need it!

03:09:28.436 --> 03:09:31.672
TRAVIS: An instant fucking big-ass tree?

03:09:31.672 --> 03:09:34.252
MATT: 60-foot-tall tree, yeah.

03:09:34.252 --> 03:09:36.988
TRAVIS: It's like a ladder.

03:09:36.989 --> 03:09:41.103
SAM: We could get into a tower or something.

03:09:41.103 --> 03:09:44.292
MATT: Or fuck up somebody's ceiling really bad!

03:09:44.292 --> 03:09:47.056
TALIESIN: That's a lot of tree.

03:09:47.056 --> 03:09:55.148
LIAM: And then, Beauregard, this armor you found
is quite exquisite, but you don't wear armor, do you?

03:09:55.148 --> 03:09:56.652
MARISHA: Not generally.

03:09:56.652 --> 03:10:01.325
LIAM: No, it's a bit hard to do all the flipping
around that you do.

03:10:01.325 --> 03:10:06.443
MARISHA: I like full range of movement in many
things that I do.

03:10:06.443 --> 03:10:08.059
TRAVIS: Caduceus does, I do.

03:10:08.059 --> 03:10:10.356
LAURA and SAM: I do.

03:10:10.356 --> 03:10:15.101
LIAM: Yeah, it would be good for any of you. This
particular one was a little better at protecting

03:10:15.101 --> 03:10:22.663
you, but also you can speak to this thing and make
the armor look like anything you like.

03:10:22.663 --> 03:10:24.891
MARISHA: Oh, fuck, that would be great to have.

03:10:24.892 --> 03:10:31.694
LIAM: It would be, yeah, but it doesn't work for
monks. You can make it look like robes, or the

03:10:31.694 --> 03:10:40.144
fanciest golden armor you can think of, or a
clown's outfit, or you can make yourself look like

03:10:40.144 --> 03:10:45.657
Fjord's clothes. It's an instant change of
clothes.

03:10:45.657 --> 03:10:47.988
MARISHA: Everyone else can do that already!

03:10:47.988 --> 03:10:50.553
LIAM: It's clothes, though, it's clothes.

03:10:50.553 --> 03:10:52.182
TRAVIS: Does it come with any protective--?

03:10:52.182 --> 03:10:54.746
LIAM: Yeah, that's the first thing I said. It's
above average.

03:10:54.746 --> 03:10:57.073
TRAVIS: I don't remember much.

03:10:57.606 --> 03:11:01.244
TALIESIN: Do you need above average? Are you
already bumped?

03:11:01.244 --> 03:11:03.425
LAURA: I'm in studded leather armor.

03:11:03.425 --> 03:11:04.834
SAM: As am I.

03:11:04.834 --> 03:11:05.960
TALIESIN: I'm in a breastplate.

03:11:05.960 --> 03:11:08.043
MARISHA: That's what it is. It's studded leather.

03:11:08.043 --> 03:11:11.694
LIAM: Studded leather, plus one.

03:11:11.694 --> 03:11:15.562
TALIESIN: Either of you would get a bonus to that.

03:11:15.562 --> 03:11:18.861
LIAM: And it's endless, it's limitless. Am I
reading that right?

03:11:18.861 --> 03:11:22.390
MATT: Yeah, whenever you want to, it can transform
to any outfit you want.

03:11:22.390 --> 03:11:25.103
TALIESIN: Either of you would be hilarious owning
this.

03:11:25.103 --> 03:11:26.866
SAM: My armor class is less than yours.

03:11:26.866 --> 03:11:31.759
LAURA: Yeah, go for it. Plus you don't have a
Disguise Self.

03:11:31.759 --> 03:11:32.956
SAM: I do.

03:11:32.956 --> 03:11:39.242
LAURA: Yeah, you should take it.

03:11:39.242 --> 03:11:41.097
MARISHA: Pretty much everyone can disguise
themselves.

03:11:41.098 --> 03:11:43.634
SAM: Jester and Laura are fighting right now.

03:11:43.634 --> 03:11:47.409
LAURA: You should take it.

03:11:47.409 --> 03:11:52.545
SAM: I'll look at it. We'll play cards for it.

03:11:53.146 --> 03:11:56.176
LIAM: Should we give this to Yasha? Fjord? Jester?
This potion?

03:11:56.176 --> 03:12:00.157
TRAVIS: Yeah, we'll hold it for Yasha. I bet it's
giant.

03:12:00.157 --> 03:12:03.694
LAURA: Let me see it. Whoa!

03:12:03.694 --> 03:12:07.115
TALIESIN: It's one fight, just become a beast.

03:12:07.115 --> 03:12:12.004
LAURA: Holy shit! Yeah, she should have it,
because that will affect her attacks, right?

03:12:12.004 --> 03:12:19.138
MATT: Anyone's melee attacks, any of your strength
checks. For an hour, someone's strength becomes badass.

03:12:19.138 --> 03:12:20.647
TRAVIS: Yasha drinks it immediately. No.

03:12:20.647 --> 03:12:22.142
MATT: No!

03:12:22.143 --> 03:12:26.107
MARISHA: "I was thirsty."

03:12:26.107 --> 03:12:28.382
TRAVIS: Whoa.

03:12:28.382 --> 03:12:29.971
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:12:29.971 --> 03:12:39.455
TRAVIS: That's a thing. That took me a long time
to get to that.

03:12:39.455 --> 03:12:41.226
MARISHA: For 23 hours?

03:12:41.226 --> 03:12:42.514
MATT: No, lasts for one hour.

03:12:42.514 --> 03:12:53.673
TALIESIN: Yeah, you'll get disqualified from a lot
of sports for taking that. That's for horses.

03:12:56.094 --> 03:12:59.723
TRAVIS: Should we get to work on forging those
documents for when we make our way in?

03:12:59.723 --> 03:13:03.487
LAURA: Yes, yes, yes. I know what all these kind
of ship documents look like! I already forged

03:13:03.487 --> 03:13:07.594
some, and also I'm around ships and stuff.

03:13:07.594 --> 03:13:19.283
MATT: For this, add your proficiency bonus for the
forgery kit, as well as your dexterity to attempt

03:13:19.283 --> 03:13:26.512
to-- actually, for this? Use intelligence. This
isn't copying documents; this is forging

03:13:26.512 --> 03:13:29.070
documentation that seems to--

03:13:29.070 --> 03:13:32.799
LAURA: You made me do this last time. You made me
use intelligence, I think.

03:13:32.799 --> 03:13:38.686
MATT: We're doing intelligence because this is
trying to create verbiage and documentation that

03:13:38.686 --> 03:13:42.390
you think will seem officious and believable.

03:13:42.390 --> 03:13:49.485
LAURA: I think, Caleb, you're very officious. Can
he help me sound more intelligent than I am?

03:13:49.485 --> 03:13:54.048
MATT: He can aid you and you can have advantage on
the roll, if he wants to help.

03:13:54.048 --> 03:13:58.731
LAURA: Should I look at the mote, you guys? Should
I look at the mote?

03:13:58.732 --> 03:14:02.246
TRAVIS: The mote? The shred of fate, or whatever?

03:14:02.246 --> 03:14:03.197
LAURA: Yeah.

03:14:03.197 --> 03:14:06.045
LIAM: You should take a look at the mote, and I
will assist you, if you care.

03:14:06.045 --> 03:14:08.149
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to look at the mote of
possibility.

03:14:08.149 --> 03:14:13.177
MATT: It gives you a mote of possibility, but it
is the dodecahedron.

03:14:13.177 --> 03:14:15.695
TRAVIS: I was like, when did we start calling it
the mote?

03:14:15.695 --> 03:14:18.373
MATT: Crystal box, whatever you want to call it.

03:14:18.373 --> 03:14:22.899
LAURA: Okay, so I'm rolling intelligence?

03:14:22.899 --> 03:14:25.353
MATT: Intelligence and proficiency bonus.

03:14:25.353 --> 03:14:27.294
LAURA: At advantage, because Caleb's helping me.

03:14:27.294 --> 03:14:28.962
MATT: Correct.

03:14:31.456 --> 03:14:33.894
LAURA: I'm going to reroll again with my mote.

03:14:33.894 --> 03:14:36.534
MATT: Okay, you roll one more d20.

03:14:41.778 --> 03:14:49.868
LAURA: That's so much better than the two and the
four that I rolled originally. 19, plus one is 20,

03:14:49.868 --> 03:14:56.617
plus proficiency is three, so 23.

03:14:56.617 --> 03:15:05.752
MATT: Using Caleb's aid and the time you have on
the ocean, waiting for periods of relatively calm waters--

03:15:05.752 --> 03:15:12.033
LAURA: Plus, I think I'm proficient with forgery
kit. Oh, I understand.

03:15:12.034 --> 03:15:20.376
MATT: It's all good. You do manage to create a
number of documents that both declare the

03:15:20.376 --> 03:15:25.584
ownership of the ship, create a false log of
various journeys that you've taken in the ship, as

03:15:25.584 --> 03:15:32.390
well as forging a few signatures of individuals at
Brokenbank that have checked in the ship in the

03:15:32.390 --> 03:15:36.103
past. Whose name is it under?

03:15:36.103 --> 03:15:39.695
LAURA: Whose name should the ship be under?

03:15:43.683 --> 03:15:45.428
SAM: Tusktooth?

03:15:45.429 --> 03:15:50.199
LAURA: Should it be Tusktooth, or should it be
somebody that's not a pirate-y name?

03:15:50.199 --> 03:15:51.671
MARISHA: Yeah, that's legal.

03:15:51.671 --> 03:15:59.838
LAURA: Yeah, a new sort of name. Do they know any
of your names in Nicodranas? I mean, it could be anybody.

03:15:59.839 --> 03:16:01.383
LIAM: Do we want it to be one of us?

03:16:01.383 --> 03:16:03.734
LAURA: Caleb, you could look pretty officious.

03:16:03.734 --> 03:16:06.305
TRAVIS: Yeah, but we don't need any sort of
official record tying us--

03:16:06.305 --> 03:16:10.032
SAM: What about Orly? He's a reputable
Nicodranian.

03:16:10.033 --> 03:16:13.401
LAURA: We would be giving the ship to Orly.

03:16:13.401 --> 03:16:14.954
TRAVIS: Orly.

03:16:14.954 --> 03:16:16.999
MATT: "Mm-hmm?"

03:16:16.999 --> 03:16:23.502
TRAVIS: In no less than 30 words, describe to me
why you should have this ship.

03:16:24.898 --> 03:16:41.723
MATT: "Captain, I couldn't possibly--" You see him
really wrestling with the idea. "I can certainly

03:16:41.723 --> 03:16:52.543
"caretake it in your absence. You intending to
m-m-mosey on northward, right?"

03:16:52.543 --> 03:17:00.684
TRAVIS: Further inland. What I think I'm saying
is: the ship is yours once we reach Nicodranas.

03:17:00.684 --> 03:17:06.269
You can sell it, you can take care of it, whatever
you see fit. You've done right by us.

03:17:06.662 --> 03:17:22.448
MATT: He thinks for himself and goes, "M-mighty
generous. I can claim ownership by name only, but

03:17:22.448 --> 03:17:33.047
"we all know who the captain of this ship is. If
you're going upward to the Empire, I can put the

03:17:33.047 --> 03:17:46.015
"crew to work. Earn a little bit of money for us
and you. When you come on back, may be a little

03:17:46.016 --> 03:17:55.049
"bit of gold in it for you. But the ship is always
yours."

03:17:55.951 --> 03:17:58.794
TRAVIS: That sounds quite agreeable, Orly.

03:17:58.794 --> 03:18:01.180
MATT: "Mm-hmm."

03:18:02.234 --> 03:18:03.378
TRAVIS: That'll be all.

03:18:03.378 --> 03:18:05.681
LAURA: Is Orly your first name or your last name?

03:18:05.681 --> 03:18:07.852
MATT: "First name, doll."

03:18:07.852 --> 03:18:09.472
LAURA: What's your last name, Orly?

03:18:09.473 --> 03:18:10.745
MATT: "Skiffback."

03:18:10.745 --> 03:18:14.135
LAURA: Skiffback. Right.

03:18:15.094 --> 03:18:20.633
MATT: "Anyway, goodnight." He turns around, makes
his way--

03:18:20.633 --> 03:18:22.740
TRAVIS: Bring him with us. Make him fight!

03:18:22.740 --> 03:18:28.269
LAURA: I &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; want a tattoo from him at some
point.

03:18:28.269 --> 03:18:31.239
MARISHA: Yeah, did you learn how to do that from
him?

03:18:31.240 --> 03:18:32.393
LAURA: We haven't done it.

03:18:32.393 --> 03:18:33.428
LIAM: It costs a lot.

03:18:33.428 --> 03:18:36.851
LAURA: Well, we just need crushed gems in order to
make them.

03:18:36.851 --> 03:18:45.789
MARISHA: I tell Jester this. My parents, when they
were trying to form me into a functional member of

03:18:45.789 --> 03:18:52.103
society, thought it would be a good idea if I got
into jewelry making, so I have a jeweler's kit.

03:18:52.103 --> 03:18:54.199
LAURA: So you could maybe crush some jewels?

03:18:54.199 --> 03:18:58.301
MARISHA: I could crush gems, yeah. Just throwing
that out there.

03:18:58.301 --> 03:19:00.808
LAURA: Orly!

03:19:01.255 --> 03:19:06.655
MATT: You hear the heavy footfalls of him turning
around and slowly coming back to the chambers.

03:19:06.655 --> 03:19:08.123
"Mm-hmm?"

03:19:08.123 --> 03:19:15.431
LAURA: How hard is it to make a cool tattoo that's
pretty? The shiny ones?

03:19:15.431 --> 03:19:18.083
MATT: "Well, you need the supplies."

03:19:18.083 --> 03:19:19.597
LAURA: Yeah.

03:19:19.598 --> 03:19:20.749
MATT: "I told you."

03:19:20.749 --> 03:19:23.443
LAURA: Yeah, like 2,200.

03:19:23.443 --> 03:19:37.421
MATT: "Baseline. Then depending on the kind of
tattoo, the cost tends to increase."

03:19:37.421 --> 03:19:38.721
SAM: We don't have that kind of--

03:19:38.722 --> 03:19:39.856
LAURA: We don't have that kind of jewels.

03:19:39.856 --> 03:19:41.135
TALIESIN: Not yet. One day.

03:19:41.135 --> 03:19:41.636
LAURA: Okay.

03:19:41.636 --> 03:19:44.244
MATT: "When you do, happy to help."

03:19:44.244 --> 03:19:47.650
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay. Thanks, Orly!

03:19:47.651 --> 03:19:52.991
MATT: "No worryin'." Turns around and makes his
way back out.

03:19:52.991 --> 03:19:54.974
TRAVIS: (as Orly) No worryin', now.

03:19:54.974 --> 03:20:01.995
TALIESIN: I'm going to gather some of my stuff and
go to the crow's nest. Get everybody--

03:20:01.995 --> 03:20:03.950
LIAM: Oh, you're going up?

03:20:03.950 --> 03:20:05.094
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:20:05.094 --> 03:20:07.199
LIAM: Do you like a good book?

03:20:07.199 --> 03:20:09.726
TALIESIN: I'm not going to be reading up there,
but--

03:20:09.726 --> 03:20:11.746
LIAM: I don't mean for tonight. In general.

03:20:11.746 --> 03:20:18.437
TALIESIN: I'll admit, I'm not the best reader, but
I've read a couple books.

03:20:18.437 --> 03:20:29.689
LIAM: But you have. One of the books that we found
in that ball of fun is about the corruption of plants.

03:20:29.689 --> 03:20:31.471
TALIESIN: I would be curious.

03:20:31.472 --> 03:20:33.478
LIAM: I thought you might be.

03:20:33.478 --> 03:20:38.760
TALIESIN: If you could leave it in my quarters,
that would be most agreeable.

03:20:38.760 --> 03:20:40.431
LIAM: Surely.

03:20:40.431 --> 03:20:42.131
TALIESIN: Thank you.

03:20:42.132 --> 03:20:44.850
LIAM: Mm-hmm. I'm glad you are traveling with us.

03:20:44.850 --> 03:20:56.897
TALIESIN: Me too. I've never felt so helpful. I'm
going to climb up and set up a little ritual

03:20:56.897 --> 03:21:04.130
circle in the crow's nest and I'm going to light
some incense and I'm going to pull out a piece of

03:21:04.130 --> 03:21:11.244
that weird fruit that I've been slowly growing
some mushrooms on, getting a little weird, eat a

03:21:11.244 --> 03:21:23.489
little bit of it. I'm going to meditate and then
I'm going to cast Divination.

03:21:25.580 --> 03:21:27.905
TRAVIS: Yeah, fluffy little clouds.

03:21:27.905 --> 03:21:32.154
MARISHA: Just a light Divination.

03:21:32.154 --> 03:21:34.613
LIAM: Just a happy little scry.

03:21:34.614 --> 03:21:38.178
TALIESIN: I'm going to feel out into the universe
and I'm going to wait for whatever sign, whether

03:21:38.178 --> 03:21:41.084
it be verbal or otherwise.

03:21:44.017 --> 03:21:47.197
Wonder what Vandran's doing right now.

03:21:47.197 --> 03:21:56.915
TRAVIS: (stuttering) What?

03:22:02.169 --> 03:22:16.582
MATT: The warm, soft, comforting voice, like a
breeze, drifts past your ears as the hot wind,

03:22:16.582 --> 03:22:29.926
unexpectedly through a cold night, drifts past
your shoulders. "Staying out of sight. Making

03:22:29.927 --> 03:22:34.277
"amends." That's all.

03:22:34.630 --> 03:22:36.352
TALIESIN: That'll do.

03:22:39.784 --> 03:22:41.979
SAM: Intrigue! Secrets!

03:22:41.979 --> 03:22:44.112
TALIESIN: I head back down.

03:22:44.112 --> 03:22:50.395
TRAVIS: (whispering) What the fuck? Leave it to
Taliesin to trip you out with shit you didn't know about.

03:22:50.395 --> 03:22:54.069
(laughter)

03:22:54.070 --> 03:22:57.134
SAM: Oh boy. Backstory.

03:22:57.134 --> 03:22:59.516
MATT: All right.

03:22:59.516 --> 03:23:00.829
TALIESIN: I'm good.

03:23:00.829 --> 03:23:06.327
MATT: Okay. Is there anything else you wish to do
during this travel, or are we going to bring us in Nicodranas?

03:23:06.327 --> 03:23:10.193
MARISHA: I would like to go to Caleb really quick
and be like: Hey. Did you happen to finish that

03:23:10.193 --> 03:23:14.648
copy of Avantika's code for me?

03:23:14.648 --> 03:23:15.813
LIAM: Yeah.

03:23:15.813 --> 03:23:17.474
MARISHA: Can I get it?

03:23:17.474 --> 03:23:18.356
LIAM: Yeah.

03:23:18.563 --> 03:23:19.863
MARISHA: Thanks.

03:23:19.863 --> 03:23:21.366
LIAM: That it?

03:23:21.366 --> 03:23:29.465
MARISHA: Yep. I go to my chambers and for the rest
of the time, I want to try and memorize her code.

03:23:29.465 --> 03:23:38.012
MATT: Okay. We'll go ahead and keep that in
consideration. It'll take you a little bit, most

03:23:38.012 --> 03:23:41.468
of the trip. It'll help you for a while. You might
want to keep it with you just as a reference point.

03:23:41.468 --> 03:23:45.559
MARISHA: Okay. At some point in time, like halfway
through, I go back to Caleb after 24 hours with

03:23:45.559 --> 03:23:53.880
it. I was like: Okay. I'm trying to memorize this.
I figured it might be useful because you know this

03:23:53.880 --> 03:23:59.240
code. You memorized this code; you have a
photographic memory. I figure if we're ever in

03:23:59.240 --> 03:24:06.877
trouble, we can write messages in this code. Not
too many people know it.

03:24:06.877 --> 03:24:12.224
LIAM: &lt;i&gt;Ja.&lt;/i&gt; If you want to take some time with
that and then we could use it, sure.

03:24:12.224 --> 03:24:13.409
MARISHA: Yeah, I've been doing that.

03:24:13.410 --> 03:24:13.935
LIAM: Okay.

03:24:13.935 --> 03:24:22.066
MARISHA: (hesitating) Will you help me? Tutor me?
It might go a little faster.

03:24:22.066 --> 03:24:28.215
LIAM: Okay. No time like the present. Let's go get
to work.

03:24:28.215 --> 03:24:29.079
MARISHA: Okay.

03:24:29.080 --> 03:24:32.794
MATT: All right, cool. You spend the rest of the
trip working together to try and memorize it to

03:24:32.794 --> 03:24:38.536
the best of your ability. It is a complicated
cipher. It's not like: this equals a, this equals

03:24:38.536 --> 03:24:44.826
b. There's layers to it, but you manage to get the
broad strokes of it, and you can keep that with

03:24:44.826 --> 03:24:46.305
you if you want to.

03:24:46.305 --> 03:24:46.959
MARISHA: I do.

03:24:46.959 --> 03:24:47.935
MATT: All right.

03:24:47.935 --> 03:24:50.068
TALIESIN: I'm going to read that book too, but
yeah, we'll talk about it later.

03:24:50.068 --> 03:24:51.194
MATT: Yeah, no worries.

03:24:51.194 --> 03:25:00.176
LAURA: I'm going to try to spend the time on the
deck teaching Sprinkle how to fetch an item. Like,

03:25:00.176 --> 03:25:07.157
if I show Sprinkle a button and hide it somewhere,
I want Sprinkle to be able to get the button and

03:25:07.157 --> 03:25:08.564
bring it back to me.

03:25:08.564 --> 03:25:10.231
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make an animal handling
check for me.

03:25:12.712 --> 03:25:14.900
LAURA: 20.

03:25:16.067 --> 03:25:22.947
MATT: Okay! Sprinkle's still a little skittish
after some of the experiences on the seas but

03:25:22.947 --> 03:25:28.736
seems to have gotten a little more comfortable.
Thankfully, there isn't a lot of chaos since you

03:25:28.736 --> 03:25:39.324
guys left the archipelago. Over the next few days,
Sprinkle seems to take to it for the button and

03:25:39.324 --> 03:25:48.737
the bits of food and treats that you provide, so
you seem to have taught a simple trick to your weasel.

03:25:50.252 --> 03:25:51.440
TALIESIN: On the Balleater.

03:25:51.440 --> 03:25:53.868
MATT: On the Balleater. Anything else?

03:25:54.361 --> 03:26:01.513
LIAM: One of the nights, while getting into bed
and Nott curling up at the foot of the bed as we

03:26:01.513 --> 03:26:03.713
customarily do--

03:26:03.713 --> 03:26:05.132
SAM: We do.

03:26:05.132 --> 03:26:12.689
LIAM: &lt;i&gt;Ja.&lt;/i&gt; I'll wait in the dark and before I
think that she has fallen asleep: Nott.

03:26:12.689 --> 03:26:14.621
SAM: Yes?

03:26:14.621 --> 03:26:20.272
LIAM: How do you feel about returning home?

03:26:21.106 --> 03:26:30.432
SAM: Oh. Well, I don't know we're 100% sure that
we're doing that, but if we did, it would be nice

03:26:30.432 --> 03:26:36.079
to just sort of swing through and see what--
because they said there was some damage, so maybe

03:26:36.080 --> 03:26:42.102
just kind of see what damage has been done and if
anyone-- you know.

03:26:42.326 --> 03:26:45.738
LIAM: So we're just going to buzz through? There's
nothing you want to check in on, or--?

03:26:46.267 --> 03:26:53.279
SAM: (stuttering) Yeah, I'd like to check in, just
see how the place is doing and, you know, if

03:26:53.279 --> 03:26:59.690
everything's still there. You know, just make sure
that everything's okay.

03:27:01.551 --> 03:27:06.716
LIAM: Sometimes it sounds like you don't have much
love for home.

03:27:08.866 --> 03:27:22.259
SAM: Yeah, it's a little complicated. I really
didn't like most of it. Certainly not my clan, as

03:27:22.259 --> 03:27:33.515
I've told you guys. You know, there's a few folks
that I didn't mind so much. There was one

03:27:33.515 --> 03:27:38.552
gentleman I wouldn't mind just checking in on,
make sure he's okay.

03:27:40.545 --> 03:27:42.277
LIAM: One of your clan?

03:27:43.365 --> 03:27:50.669
SAM: (stuttering) No, just a friend of mine that I
just wanted--

03:27:52.161 --> 03:27:54.128
LIAM: Not one of your clan?

03:27:54.128 --> 03:28:05.258
SAM: No. They're not my friends at all. They're
bad. No, this was just this halfling man who lived

03:28:05.259 --> 03:28:14.842
in the town near where the goblins lived, and so I
maybe just want to see if he's okay.

03:28:18.088 --> 03:28:20.206
LIAM: Oh, okay.

03:28:21.615 --> 03:28:31.208
SAM: He was very special to me and I just want
to-- I'm worried about him. Do you have anyone

03:28:31.208 --> 03:28:32.914
like that?

03:28:35.366 --> 03:28:36.870
LIAM: No.

03:28:38.631 --> 03:28:41.371
SAM: Well, you do, just--

03:28:42.473 --> 03:28:44.408
LIAM: Well, not besides you.

03:28:44.584 --> 03:28:46.120
SAM: Not at home, yes.

03:28:46.120 --> 03:28:54.046
LIAM: Not besides you. That clan is all right with
you? Was there any friction that we should be--?

03:28:54.637 --> 03:29:03.376
SAM: Oh. I would assume not. No. They're not okay
with me. I did not leave under good circumstances

03:29:03.376 --> 03:29:18.655
with them. If we pass through, I would either not
want to see them, or if we did, be ready for a fight.

03:29:19.165 --> 03:29:31.824
LIAM: Oh. So, you want to go home briefly, but not
to see the clan, but just this one fellow?

03:29:32.345 --> 03:29:41.726
SAM: Mm-hmm. (stuttering) Yeah. I don't really--

03:29:42.949 --> 03:29:44.099
LIAM: You are very--

03:29:44.099 --> 03:29:53.407
SAM: I'm sorry. I'm just so nervous about it. I
don't want to see the clan ever again if I can

03:29:53.408 --> 03:29:55.229
help it.

03:29:56.223 --> 03:29:58.686
LIAM: So, we're going around your home, is what
you're saying?

03:29:58.686 --> 03:30:05.945
SAM: Well, we might have to go through it to get
past it, but yeah. I don't really consider myself

03:30:05.945 --> 03:30:11.677
one of them anymore and I just want to see if my
friend is okay.

03:30:11.677 --> 03:30:15.257
LIAM: &lt;i&gt;Ja.&lt;/i&gt; Whatever you need. Whatever you need,
we'll do.

03:30:15.257 --> 03:30:21.708
SAM: This trip on the water was &lt;i&gt;not fun&lt;/i&gt;, but--

03:30:22.617 --> 03:30:26.508
LIAM: It was pretty interesting though. You did
quite well out there. I mean, obviously you were

03:30:26.509 --> 03:30:30.690
like a goblin in water, but you did quite well out
there.

03:30:30.690 --> 03:30:40.094
SAM: But, we did some good. I feel like we're a
little closer as a group, and we got those books

03:30:40.094 --> 03:30:48.924
for you, right? And when we get some paper and
some ink, you can learn some new spells.

03:30:48.924 --> 03:30:51.735
LIAM: I am very pleased with that.

03:30:51.735 --> 03:30:52.647
SAM: Yes.

03:30:52.647 --> 03:30:58.819
LIAM: I'm also impressed with you. You have a
knack. You have &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; knack. I would know.

03:30:58.819 --> 03:31:04.599
SAM: You would know that I have a knack for
stealing things, or what?

03:31:04.599 --> 03:31:08.369
LIAM: No. Magic.

03:31:08.369 --> 03:31:16.076
SAM: (gasps) Well, yeah. I've found that it's
pretty fun. You can make people think things that

03:31:16.076 --> 03:31:22.955
aren't real and you can even change things from
one thing to another. You're very good at that,

03:31:22.955 --> 03:31:24.646
aren't you?

03:31:24.646 --> 03:31:34.050
[music]

03:31:34.050 --> 03:31:36.205
LIAM: I'm proud of you.

03:31:38.736 --> 03:31:41.213
SAM: We should sleep.

03:31:43.869 --> 03:31:46.040
LIAM: Good night, Nott.

03:31:46.040 --> 03:31:47.868
SAM: Good night.

03:31:53.467 --> 03:32:04.128
MATT: After a few days' journey, tending to your
various bits of business, eventually the familiar

03:32:04.128 --> 03:32:17.006
sound of seagulls gathered near the coast meets
your ears on the warm, sunny morning. As you wake

03:32:17.006 --> 03:32:25.122
up and glance up into the light of day past the
stairs that lead to the deck, you can see the

03:32:25.122 --> 03:32:34.955
familiar sight of the harbor of Nicodranas. There,
the familiar visual of the Mother's Lighthouse,

03:32:34.955 --> 03:32:43.641
greeting you in towards the bay. Caduceus, you
can't help be but overtaken with that comforting

03:32:43.641 --> 03:32:53.065
welcome sense, and you swear for a minute you see
her glance in your direction, but you blink-- Hmm,

03:32:53.065 --> 03:33:00.910
that was strange. You prepare your papers and make
your way in towards one of the various openings

03:33:00.911 --> 03:33:07.865
across the harbor. We'll pick up there next week
as it is getting late.

03:33:07.865 --> 03:33:11.416
SAM: Wow, what a way to start the year.

03:33:11.416 --> 03:33:22.367
TRAVIS: Oh man. That was awesome. I'm sorry that
we capsized the boat so fast!

03:33:22.367 --> 03:33:23.692
MATT: That was funny!

03:33:23.693 --> 03:33:24.771
TALIESIN: Like a badass.

03:33:24.771 --> 03:33:27.636
MATT: No, I've been sitting on that rule set while
you guys are at sea.

03:33:27.636 --> 03:33:30.400
TALIESIN: It's really cool, and it's going to
happen.

03:33:30.401 --> 03:33:37.793
MATT: Mike Mearls at Wizards-- he did this
Unearthed Arcana a while back in November for

03:33:37.793 --> 03:33:44.547
rules at sea and I was like: ooh, I'll incorporate
those whenever it comes up. I did some adjustments

03:33:44.547 --> 03:33:51.868
to it, some homebrewing. I was like: maybe it
will-- no. Well, maybe if they-- no. Well, see, if

03:33:51.868 --> 03:33:58.419
Avantika escapes and they chased-- No, she died.
Okay, well, they're going to the archipelago and

03:33:58.420 --> 03:34:04.184
there is-- okay, cool. No. Okay, well. We're back
in Nicodranas. You guys get to try out the rules

03:34:04.184 --> 03:34:11.272
and tell me how that went! It's funny. Anyway,
welcome back! I missed you guys. I missed the

03:34:11.272 --> 03:34:17.820
game. We missed you guys. We'll be back next
Thursday. Then we'll see some of you guys at the

03:34:17.820 --> 03:34:21.865
art exhibit here in LA next weekend as well.

03:34:21.865 --> 03:34:27.508
LIAM: Oh my gosh. Thursday: show! Friday: art
show! Saturday: live show! It's going to be busy.

03:34:27.508 --> 03:34:29.598
MATT: It's going to be a crazy week.

03:34:29.598 --> 03:34:31.798
LAURA: I'm going to be so sick of you mother--

03:34:31.798 --> 03:34:32.943
SAM: I know.

03:34:32.943 --> 03:34:38.404
MATT: If you aren't by now, Laura, you've got no
excuse by now. We'll see you guys back here next

03:34:38.404 --> 03:34:44.829
Thursday. Until then, have a wonderful week. We
love you, and is it Thursday yet? Goodnight.

03:34:44.830 --> 03:34:48.145
TRAVIS and LAURA: 2019!

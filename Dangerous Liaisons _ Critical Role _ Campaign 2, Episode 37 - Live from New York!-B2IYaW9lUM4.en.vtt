00:00:10.161 --> 00:00:12.517
BRIAN: Hello, New York!

00:00:12.517 --> 00:00:22.136
[cheering]

00:00:22.136 --> 00:00:28.451
Wow! I would ask how everyone's doing, but I can
already tell.

00:00:28.451 --> 00:00:33.511
[cheering]

00:00:33.511 --> 00:00:35.757
Who's ready to get turnt up tonight?

00:00:35.757 --> 00:00:40.148
[cheering]

00:00:40.148 --> 00:00:47.331
You know, I talked to Taliesin a couple weeks ago
and I said, "How in the world do we top what you

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:56.517
"did for me for Gen Con?" He said, "I have five
words for you, Brian. The Goth of Wall Street."

00:00:56.517 --> 00:01:06.306
[laughter and cheering]

00:01:06.306 --> 00:01:13.011
Well, we have a great show planned for you guys. I
am really interested to see how this is going to

00:01:13.011 --> 00:01:19.714
go. Given the last few episodes, I'm sure you are.
I have a couple of bad cop announcements, it's

00:01:19.714 --> 00:01:26.668
what I get paid to do. Up first, and you know,
we're all really waiting to see what Sam's going

00:01:26.668 --> 00:01:28.247
to do, am I right?

00:01:28.247 --> 00:01:32.368
[cheering]

00:01:32.368 --> 00:01:41.715
(sighs) Hide your kids, hide your wives. First of
all, feel free to engage along with the show

00:01:41.715 --> 00:01:47.121
tonight. Some of the ways you can engage along
with the show is clapping, which you seem to do

00:01:47.121 --> 00:01:49.007
very well, wonderful.

00:01:49.007 --> 00:01:52.344
[applause]

00:01:52.344 --> 00:01:54.666
You can definitely cheer.

00:01:54.666 --> 00:01:57.733
[cheering]

00:01:57.733 --> 00:01:59.740
This one's going to be hard, you can cry.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.320
[fake crying]

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:11.394
That sounds good. Sounds genuine. The one thing
that we do ask that you refrain from during the

00:02:11.394 --> 00:02:19.662
live shows is shouting out any rules, suggestions,
things like that. "Use Feather Fall!" Shit like

00:02:19.662 --> 00:02:25.569
that's not going to fly. "You have two spell slots
left!" Nobody cares what you have to say.

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:34.588
Especially no jokes that you think are going to
either get a reaction from the cast or from the

00:02:34.588 --> 00:02:41.467
rest of the audience. Take it from someone who
knows, sometimes you think you have a great joke

00:02:43.427 --> 00:02:49.518
and it's a fucking terrible one. At Gen Con this
year, some people decided to rebel against the

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:55.315
rules and nothing made me happier than hearing
someone yell out a joke and it bombing. I was up

00:02:55.315 --> 00:03:02.995
in the balcony leaning down going, "Welcome to my
Tuesday night, every week." I guarantee you guys

00:03:02.995 --> 00:03:06.791
Matt and the cast are going to put on a fantastic
show for you tonight.

00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:09.496
[cheering]

00:03:09.496 --> 00:03:18.272
Yep. Despite the fact it will not contain any of
your bad jokes. Up next: we will be broadcasting

00:03:18.272 --> 00:03:27.076
at an hour delay tonight, so there is an extremely
strict no spoiler policy in the house tonight.

00:03:27.076 --> 00:03:33.692
After Sam comes out and sits down, there's really
no need for you guys to have your phones out

00:03:33.692 --> 00:03:41.854
tonight. Please do not spoil it for all of our
Critters watching literally around the world.

00:03:41.854 --> 00:03:46.863
Don't get on Twitter, don't get on Tumblr, don't
get into Twitch chat and say shit, don't be a

00:03:46.863 --> 00:03:55.239
dick. Please, please, please. Ultimately, there's
more of them than there are of us, so we got to be

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:02.154
careful, if you know what I'm saying. I don't want
people coming after us. Okay, if you're at New

00:04:02.154 --> 00:04:07.705
York Comic Con this weekend, please check out our
schedule at CritRole.com. We're going to be busy.

00:04:07.705 --> 00:04:09.400

[cheering]

00:04:10.911 --> 00:04:20.000
Wow. That's going to be awesome. Let's see. Oh
yeah, introduce the cast, okay. Without further

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:28.031
ado, I would like to introduce the cast of
Critical Role.

what is.

00:07:48.808 --> 00:07:50.060
TRAVIS: Oh yeah. Mainline that shit.

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:53.803

Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass--

[cheering] [Matt gleefully laughing]

00:08:10.898 --> 00:08:15.153
MATT: Where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors
sit around dressed as pirates and play Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons.

[cheering]

00:08:22.988 --> 00:08:24.685
LAURA: Arr.

00:08:24.685 --> 00:08:28.455
MATT: Now before we make our way into tonight's
episode, we got a few announcements to make, so be

00:08:28.455 --> 00:08:34.645
patient, please. First and foremost, the second
episode of All Work No Play debuts tomorrow.

00:08:34.645 --> 00:08:39.856
[cheering]

00:08:39.856 --> 00:08:47.315
MATT: With our fantastic Sam and Liam, they
learned how to tap dance, loosely. That'll be

00:08:47.315 --> 00:08:51.891
debuting tomorrow at 7:00pm Pacific. For those of
us here on the east coast right now, that's going

00:08:51.891 --> 00:08:56.764
to be 10:00pm. That'll be at
Twitch.tv/CriticalRole. Check it out, it's really

00:08:56.764 --> 00:09:02.173
funny. We watched the episode earlier; I hope you
enjoy it. Between the Sheets, our new episode airs

00:09:02.173 --> 00:09:09.187
Monday at 7:00pm Pacific, 10:00pm here. Our guest
this week is the fantastic Liam O'Brien over there

00:09:09.187 --> 00:09:10.400
on the side table.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:19.132

[cheering]

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:31.787
MATT: Check that out on Monday at
twitch.tv/CriticalRole. Also, we do not have a

00:09:31.787 --> 00:09:38.953
Wyrmwood giveaway this week, because instead, all
of our live attendees tonight at the show, when

00:09:38.953 --> 00:09:40.496
the show is over on your way out,

00:09:40.496 --> 00:09:44.133
you'll be receiving a $25 Wyrmwood gift card.

00:09:44.133 --> 00:09:45.033

00:09:45.033 --> 00:09:53.208
[cheering]

00:09:53.208 --> 00:10:02.452
MATT: Our amazing friends at Wyrmwood have been so
kind to help facilitate this for all of you

00:10:02.452 --> 00:10:07.099
amazing Critters out there. On your way out
tonight, make sure you grab it, don't forget it,

00:10:07.099 --> 00:10:23.250
you'll regret it. Whew. Man, my heart is going
(quick pounding). Never get used to this. A quick

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:26.944
little thing before we get started on the game. We
mentioned it earlier this year, we have our

00:10:26.944 --> 00:10:31.992
fantastic continuation of the Vox Machina: Origins
comic book with Dark Horse that we're in

00:10:31.992 --> 00:10:40.716
development on. The next six issues are
currently-- we're in the process of getting them

00:10:40.716 --> 00:10:47.221
going. Currently, the planned date is the summer
of next year. We're happy to announce that our

00:10:47.221 --> 00:10:50.821
original artist, Olivia Samson, a fellow Critter
from the community, who's done an amazing job, is

00:10:50.821 --> 00:11:00.048
returning to be the artist for this. We're going
to reveal a couple little art pieces here to show

00:11:00.048 --> 00:11:05.291
you some of the new characters you'll meet next
summer, including our very own Pike and Percy. If

00:11:05.291 --> 00:11:07.572
you want to give a quick view of that up there.

00:11:07.572 --> 00:11:16.427
[cheering]

00:11:16.427 --> 00:11:23.815
MATT: Some of these characters you may have seen
in our pre-stream recap video from years ago. You

00:11:23.815 --> 00:11:28.838
also get to see-- I think some of these cast
hasn't seen them until tonight now. We've got

00:11:28.838 --> 00:11:32.788
Abjurist Noja, we've got Wilhand Trickfoot up
there, we got Pike when her hair was still dark,

00:11:32.788 --> 00:11:34.544
before her first death.

00:11:34.544 --> 00:11:36.045
LAURA: Stonejaw Strongjaw!

00:11:36.045 --> 00:11:46.168
MATT: We have casual prison Percival in his true
Whitestone, pale-ass self. We got Drez Vina, we

00:11:46.168 --> 00:11:53.313
got a temple keeper who was working for Lady Kima
in Westruun. We have Realmseer Eskil Ryndarien,

00:11:53.313 --> 00:11:58.194
who you saw a few times throughout the first
campaign, as well as Nala the dryad, who you got

00:11:58.194 --> 00:12:04.389
to meet-- the nymph that you got to meet later in
the campaign. You get to see her first interaction

00:12:04.389 --> 00:12:10.544
with Grog. A couple other fun characters that
you'll get to see throughout the story. Anyway,

00:12:10.544 --> 00:12:14.788
really excited about that. More information will
become available as it does, but hopefully you

00:12:14.788 --> 00:12:16.964
guys get to enjoy it next year.

00:12:23.126 --> 00:12:26.804

[cheering]

00:12:31.113 --> 00:12:36.899
MATT: We've got a few quick announcements again.
Like how I did that?

00:12:36.899 --> 00:12:38.492
SAM: Yeah, yeah.

00:12:38.492 --> 00:12:42.570
MATT: Pull those heart strings. We have our
fantastic sponsor for the evening. Since the

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:46.154
beginning of the campaign, our good friends at D&amp;amp;D
Beyond.

00:12:46.154 --> 00:12:55.054
SAM: Yeah. D&amp;amp;D Beyond, guys. You know them, you
love them, and to celebrate Critical Role live in

00:12:55.054 --> 00:13:02.584
New York, D&amp;amp;D Beyond has set up a discount code,
just for a limited time. It'll get you 25% off

00:13:02.584 --> 00:13:07.636
digital books on the D&amp;amp;D Beyond marketplace, but
you got to use this code, and I'm not making this

00:13:07.636 --> 00:13:10.959
up, it's SamIsOurHero.

00:13:10.959 --> 00:13:18.742
[laughter and cheering]

00:13:18.742 --> 00:13:23.499
SAM: Go check it out. In fact, I'm so flattered
that they named their code after me that I wrote a

00:13:23.499 --> 00:13:33.164
little Broadway song. Can't even hear the pitch.
(singing) Da. (spoken) Okay, about their discount

00:13:33.164 --> 00:13:39.209
code, SamIsOurHero. Okay. I'm going to sing it a
cappella. (clears throat) (singing to the tune of

00:13:39.209 --> 00:13:48.593
"Dear Theodosia") SamIsOurHero is the code to use.
To buy your books at steeply discount rates. When

00:13:48.593 --> 00:13:56.779
you go to D&amp;amp;D Beyond, just mention me.

00:13:56.779 --> 00:14:04.588
ASHLEY: (singing) Sam is our hero and he's
handsome too. Look at that smile, and such a

00:14:04.588 --> 00:14:13.276
boyish face. Oh my god, these lyrics are so
crappy. Why did I agree?

00:14:13.276 --> 00:14:15.764
SAM: This crowd is loving my song!

00:14:15.764 --> 00:14:18.067
ASHLEY: They think it's slightly too long.

00:14:18.067 --> 00:14:24.774
SAM: I'll win a Tony Award after all! I'll do
whatever it takes--

00:14:24.774 --> 00:14:26.931
ASHLEY: This was an awful mistake.

00:14:26.931 --> 00:14:38.703
SAM and ASHLEY: I cannot wait for our curtain
call! Sam is ruining Hamilton. I hope the audience

00:14:38.768 --> 00:14:47.756
knows that Ashley told him no. And we know that we
should start the game now, but it's such a pretty

00:14:47.756 --> 00:15:07.788
song for D&amp;amp;D Beyond, so we sang it anyway. Bidet,
bidet. Sam is our hero, yeah. Bidet, bidet. Okay,

00:15:07.788 --> 00:15:10.576
Matt, take it away.

00:15:27.313 --> 00:15:33.132
MATT: Thank you, Sam and Ashley, and thank you our
friends at D&amp;amp;D Beyond. And thank you Hamilton for

00:15:33.132 --> 00:15:37.609
hopefully enduring that terrible butchering of a
wonderful piece of music.

00:15:37.609 --> 00:15:43.618
SAM: I think when Lin-Manuel wrote the song, he
thought that it would be used in a D&amp;amp;D Beyond ad eventually.

00:15:44.281 --> 00:15:49.759
MATT: I think it was hard to avoid down the road,
yeah. Well, all right guys. Let's go ahead and

00:15:49.759 --> 00:15:53.635
bring us in to tonight's episode of Critical
Role.

now?

TRAVIS: Yes.

00:17:44.313 --> 00:17:51.706
MATT: Perfect, there we go. Welcome back. Last we
left off, The Mighty Nein, in following a thread

00:17:51.706 --> 00:18:01.341
of information that may tie into some aspect of
Fjord's curious history after he chest-vored a

00:18:01.341 --> 00:18:09.981
sphere, discovered that, apparently, a group of
individuals were hired to retrieve this and bring

00:18:09.981 --> 00:18:14.237
it to a Captain Avantika. Upon following this
thread, you found your way to the city of

00:18:14.237 --> 00:18:18.951
Nicodranas on the Menagerie Coast, outside the
Dwendalian Empire. You met up with Yasha once

00:18:18.951 --> 00:18:29.548
more, you happened to take care of a man who was
bothering Jester's mother. Very thoroughly. Upon

00:18:29.548 --> 00:18:38.572
coming upon this character, Marius LePual, who
you've been following, you got into an altercation

00:18:38.572 --> 00:18:49.112
at the docks and accidentally took their boat.
However, you managed to sneak your way back to

00:18:49.112 --> 00:18:54.145
Nicodranas the following day before it seemed
there was much of an uproar searching for you. You

00:18:54.145 --> 00:19:04.847
stealth hired a crew, including bringing Orly the
tortle bard on as your navigator, and made your

00:19:04.847 --> 00:19:10.572
way out to sea towards this island called Urukaxl
that you believed may have been the one, based on

00:19:10.572 --> 00:19:15.021
this piece of a map that you had recovered within
the ship, The Mist. You changed the name of the

00:19:15.021 --> 00:19:20.354
ship to The Mistake. You became Captain Tusktooth,
was it?

00:19:20.354 --> 00:19:23.342
TRAVIS: Yes.

00:19:23.342 --> 00:19:25.799
MARISHA: Yes, own it, yes.

00:19:25.799 --> 00:19:28.323
TRAVIS: I mean, yeah.

00:19:29.871 --> 00:19:34.671
MATT: Following the map, you made your way through
the reef, taking on a bit of water briefly, but

00:19:34.671 --> 00:19:42.537
thankfully through some ingenuity, some quick
repairs, and the tenuous use of a magical tent,

00:19:42.537 --> 00:19:48.452
you kept it from sinking, and going towards the
shoreline of Urukaxl, there appeared to be another

00:19:48.452 --> 00:19:53.569
ship, a larger ship, waiting in the nearest bay.
Upon attempting to possibly make your way around

00:19:53.569 --> 00:19:58.930
it to run it aground, the ship seemed to be
cutting you off, and fired a warning cannon shot

00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:07.132
across the bow. You decided it was best to stop,
and began to gather yourselves as two small

00:20:07.132 --> 00:20:14.055
rowboats were making their way towards the outside
of The Mistake to whatever ends that may come to.

00:20:14.055 --> 00:20:16.423
Caleb, are you still below deck holding onto your
spell?

00:20:16.423 --> 00:20:17.420
LIAM: Yeah.

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:27.027
MATT: Good. Because I believe that is where we
left off. Mighty Nein, as you see these two small

00:20:27.027 --> 00:20:33.755
boats slowly rowing their way towards you from the
far side of the bay, what do you do?

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:36.321
MARISHA: Fjord.

00:20:36.321 --> 00:20:37.982
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:20:37.982 --> 00:20:45.093
MARISHA: Is this like one of those, like a
parfait? What's it called?

00:20:45.093 --> 00:20:48.064
SAM: Oh, with the yogurt? Those are really good.

00:20:48.064 --> 00:20:53.509
MARISHA: No, not that one, when you talk with
other people who know how to sail.

00:20:53.509 --> 00:20:54.925
TRAVIS: Parlay?

00:20:54.925 --> 00:20:56.111
MARISHA: That one.

00:20:56.111 --> 00:20:59.079
TRAVIS: Yeah. I think it will be a parlay,
unfortunately.

00:20:59.079 --> 00:21:01.223
MARISHA: Oh, parfaits are bad?

00:21:01.223 --> 00:21:03.094
LAURA: Why unfortunately?

00:21:03.094 --> 00:21:06.932
TRAVIS: Well, I don't know who these people are,
what kind of ship they've come in on. I mean, this

00:21:06.932 --> 00:21:13.260
can go one of two ways, either very amicably or we
all die.

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:16.324
LAURA: Do you think it's the Captain Avantika?

00:21:16.324 --> 00:21:22.733
TRAVIS: Oh, I don't know. Do we have a spyglass
onboard this ship? Lead, anything?

00:21:22.733 --> 00:21:28.543
MARISHA: Ooh, oh! Caleb gave me his Frumpkin.
Frumpkin--

00:21:28.543 --> 00:21:36.425
[laughter]

00:21:36.425 --> 00:21:43.079
TRAVIS: I said a spyglass and you pulled out a
bird.

00:21:43.079 --> 00:21:46.481
MARISHA: Frumpkin, go spy on the ship.

00:21:46.481 --> 00:21:51.037
[laughter]

00:21:51.037 --> 00:21:54.313
MATT: Thankfully the intelligent creature managed
to swoop up before hitting the surface of the

00:21:54.313 --> 00:22:01.167
ocean there. Frumpkin continues to head off
towards the other ship. At this point in time, the

00:22:01.167 --> 00:22:06.161
rest of the rowboats travel, just about to reach
the bottom of The Mistake.

00:22:06.161 --> 00:22:07.437
TRAVIS: Oh, they're that close?

00:22:07.437 --> 00:22:10.301
MATT: Well yeah, as you're waiting here. If
there's anything else you want to prepare in the

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:13.417
meantime, I know you had said you changed your
form to look like the previous captain.

00:22:13.417 --> 00:22:17.955
TRAVIS: Yeah, so I'm going to look like the
half-orc captain. Was I close enough to hear him

00:22:17.955 --> 00:22:20.246
talk when he was on the dock?

00:22:20.246 --> 00:22:21.497
MATT: No, you were far away.

00:22:21.497 --> 00:22:25.958
TRAVIS: Shit, fuck, balls, ass! Okay, so I'm going
to make myself look like him.

00:22:25.958 --> 00:22:30.511
MATT: Yeah. It was less that you were far away and
more that you were in the water, and then made a

00:22:30.511 --> 00:22:32.912
thunder strike, and then were far away, and then
he was paralyzed--

00:22:32.912 --> 00:22:34.603
TRAVIS: Yeah, I know, we don't have to relive it.

00:22:34.603 --> 00:22:35.353
MATT: Sorry.

00:22:35.353 --> 00:22:41.443
LIAM: From down below inside the bubble of
Leomund's Tiny Hut, I pull out the wire and I cast

00:22:41.443 --> 00:22:46.050
Message up to Fjord and say: I have plugged the
bottom of the ship, so I think our troubles are

00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:47.802
behind us now.

00:22:47.802 --> 00:22:53.781
[laughter]

00:22:53.781 --> 00:22:56.016
TRAVIS: Can I reply to that message?

00:22:56.016 --> 00:22:58.028
MATT: Mm-hmm.

00:22:58.028 --> 00:23:00.918
TRAVIS: We're about to be boarded by fucking
pirates.

00:23:00.918 --> 00:23:05.428
[laughter]

00:23:05.428 --> 00:23:12.433
[applause and cheering]

00:23:12.433 --> 00:23:16.263
SAM: Tell him they might have yogurt with them.

00:23:18.534 --> 00:23:24.151
TRAVIS: Can I make myself look like the Captain
Jawgrasp, but can I put like, a bloody bandage

00:23:24.151 --> 00:23:29.211
around my throat, as if I suffered a wound, and
I'll talk like this.

00:23:29.211 --> 00:23:30.812
MATT: You can certainly try, yeah.

00:23:30.812 --> 00:23:32.478
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:23:32.478 --> 00:23:37.630
LAURA: Fjord, do you want us to look like anything
along with you, or should we just look like ourselves?

00:23:37.686 --> 00:23:41.317
TRAVIS: Well, I mean, not that you're already
really super dangerous-looking, but maybe you

00:23:41.317 --> 00:23:43.627
could like, menace it up a little bit?

00:23:43.627 --> 00:23:48.042
LAURA: Okay, I look like me, only menacing.

00:23:49.176 --> 00:23:53.173
SAM: What, your eyebrows just go like this?

00:23:53.173 --> 00:24:02.449
LAURA: Like that, and like I put a lot of cool
tattoos on my arms, and like, I make my fangs even longer.

00:24:02.838 --> 00:24:06.931
MATT: Okay. I envision like the anime girl, where
like all of a sudden the eyes are covered in shadow.

00:24:06.931 --> 00:24:07.606
LAURA: Yeah!

00:24:07.606 --> 00:24:09.469
MATT: Yeah, perfect.

00:24:09.469 --> 00:24:13.112
LAURA: My dress is like, tight now.

00:24:14.269 --> 00:24:14.958
MATT: All right.

00:24:14.958 --> 00:24:20.911
[cheering]

00:24:20.911 --> 00:24:23.290
MATT: Anybody else?

00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:28.098
TALIESIN: I don't even know how to interpret this
kind of input, god. First of all, I want to see

00:24:28.098 --> 00:24:30.507
how many people are in these boats coming in, are
they--

00:24:30.507 --> 00:24:31.852
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:24:31.852 --> 00:24:35.314
TRAVIS: I'm going to roll a perception check.

00:24:35.314 --> 00:24:36.447
SAM: First roll.

00:24:36.447 --> 00:24:42.618
TALIESIN: It's terrible, but I'm pretty
perceptive, so that's, where is that, 12.

00:24:42.618 --> 00:24:46.635
MATT: They're getting pretty close, so it's not a
terrible DC at this point in time. There are two

00:24:46.635 --> 00:24:54.648
figures in one boat and a very large figure in the
other, alone. One of the boats is like, sinking in

00:24:54.648 --> 00:24:57.950
the water, or not really sinking, but is
definitely pushing towards the boundaries of

00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:06.131
buoyancy. The other boat, however, seems to carry
two figures, one looks to be a female, a little

00:25:06.131 --> 00:25:11.471
older, maybe in 50s or 60s, the other figure seems
to be the one that's rowing.

00:25:11.471 --> 00:25:15.736
LAURA: What does her jacket look like? I mean,
sorry.

00:25:15.736 --> 00:25:18.521
MATT: I will say you cannot quite make out that
detail from this distance.

00:25:18.521 --> 00:25:20.257
TALIESIN: Looks like a jacket.

00:25:20.257 --> 00:25:23.095
MATT: Are you lowering any of the rope ladders,
or?

00:25:23.095 --> 00:25:25.896
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, hold on, I know the name.

00:25:25.896 --> 00:25:33.123
[cheering]

00:25:33.123 --> 00:25:40.718
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm going to tell Beau to go
activate the windlass and lower the anchor.

00:25:40.718 --> 00:25:50.737
MARISHA: I go over and I smack Yasha's ass. Is
that-- Wait, that's what you said, right? No, nope.

00:25:50.737 --> 00:25:52.194
TRAVIS: The windlass!

00:25:52.194 --> 00:25:54.962
MARISHA: The wind lass.

00:25:54.962 --> 00:26:00.269
TRAVIS: Yeah, and we'll make sure that flag is
nice and high that had the gray--

00:26:00.269 --> 00:26:04.069
MATT: You got it. Yasha?

00:26:04.069 --> 00:26:08.844
ASHLEY: Am I in your way, Beau?

00:26:08.844 --> 00:26:15.168
MARISHA: Oh, I don't know how to sail, so. That's
all.

00:26:15.168 --> 00:26:16.476
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:26:16.476 --> 00:26:21.143
MATT: At this point you hear the two dull (thuds)
of the two other small rowboats hitting the bottom

00:26:21.143 --> 00:26:25.902
of the ship, and you hear the climbing up the side
of the boat. Eventually emerging, the first thing

00:26:25.902 --> 00:26:32.122
you see is one giant meaty hand come over the top
of the side of the ship, and rising up, you see a

00:26:32.122 --> 00:26:40.970
haggard female ogre. You see stringy, greasy hair
that's peeling in front of the face, obscuring

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:47.429
part of one eye, the other one looks to be a bit
clouded. You can see these like streaks of dark,

00:26:47.429 --> 00:26:54.065
what would've been possibly makeup, and beyond
that, a leather tunic and these thick, rippling,

00:26:54.065 --> 00:27:00.136
muscular arms. She eventually gets over the side
of the ship and then puts her hand over and helps

00:27:00.136 --> 00:27:06.188
the other two up. One of them appears to be a
gentleman, probably in his late 30s, mostly bald,

00:27:06.188 --> 00:27:11.658
a little bit of hair on the sides, a light blond,
and he seems to be a little more demure compared

00:27:11.658 --> 00:27:17.109
to the two. Immediately his gait and presence
seems to be more of at least a lower position on

00:27:17.109 --> 00:27:22.478
the hierarchy of the other ship. The last one that
comes up is the woman that you saw. This woman,

00:27:22.478 --> 00:27:32.306
she's a tougher-looking middle-aged woman,
thicker, heftier body, weathered face. She's

00:27:32.306 --> 00:27:38.071
wearing tattered robes, but beneath that there is
a set of leather armor, there is a cutlass to one

00:27:38.071 --> 00:27:43.657
side, and she has this small amulet that's
dangling from a heavy chain around the neck.

00:27:43.657 --> 00:27:47.520
TALIESIN: Oh, before they even come up, I'm going
to look like the ship's cook, I am not looking

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:52.190
aggressive for this. I am putting on a chef's
outfit and getting small and human with awful red

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:58.016
hair, so, yeah, I'm out.

00:27:58.016 --> 00:28:03.592
MATT: As they step up, the ogre looks around at
the rest of you and grins with this broken, toothy

00:28:03.592 --> 00:28:15.813
glare. (snarls) The woman clears her throat and
addresses you. "You are requested to the bows of

00:28:15.813 --> 00:28:19.340
"The Squalleater immediately."

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:22.496
SAM: It's the ship! That's the ship that she
owns!

00:28:22.496 --> 00:28:26.421
TRAVIS: (pigeon cooing)

00:28:26.421 --> 00:28:30.707
MATT: "It is recommended by the captain that you
immediately make your way across with whatever

00:28:30.707 --> 00:28:37.379
"boats you have available. There's a space for some
with us, but should you decline or make any move

00:28:37.379 --> 00:28:42.666
"outside of complete and utter compliance, you and
your ship will sink."

00:28:42.666 --> 00:28:53.134
TRAVIS: (rasping) Actually, funny you mention
sinking our boat. Sustained some damage, so if I

00:28:53.134 --> 00:29:01.407
could request of the captain, perhaps some grace
while we go into shore. I'm afraid if we try to

00:29:01.407 --> 00:29:05.258
make it to her ship, we might be on the bottom of
the ocean.

00:29:05.258 --> 00:29:10.705
LAURA: His throat was slit, you can probably see.
So he has a hard time talking.

00:29:10.705 --> 00:29:15.761
MATT: She turns to you with like an intense glare
and goes, "Jawgrasp, you seem to have sustained

00:29:15.761 --> 00:29:19.026
"some sort of terrible wound."

00:29:19.026 --> 00:29:24.145
TRAVIS: Yes, my throat, it's all fucked up.

00:29:24.145 --> 00:29:26.625
MATT: Make a deception check with advantage.

00:29:26.625 --> 00:29:27.618
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:29:27.618 --> 00:29:30.022
MARISHA: Oh yas, queen.

00:29:32.812 --> 00:29:37.606
TRAVIS: 17!

00:29:39.704 --> 00:29:44.822
MATT: "If you come with whatever your most
immediate crew is," and she looks about and says,

00:29:44.822 --> 00:29:50.477
"And it would appear that you've lost most of your
previous crew?"

00:29:50.477 --> 00:29:58.419
TRAVIS: Yeah, heavy casualties. Yeah. The
butcher's bill was very steep, yep.

00:29:58.419 --> 00:30:04.306
MATT: "So you bring unproven individuals into our
plans?"

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.569
TRAVIS: It would seem that way.

00:30:10.569 --> 00:30:14.434
[laughter]

00:30:14.434 --> 00:30:19.297
TRAVIS: But these are battle-hardened men and
women, every one of them.

00:30:19.297 --> 00:30:20.845
LAURA: Arr!

00:30:20.845 --> 00:30:23.815
MARISHA: Ah ha!

00:30:23.815 --> 00:30:27.519
[laughter]

00:30:27.519 --> 00:30:32.186
SAM: Yo ho! Ho?

00:30:37.518 --> 00:30:43.484
MATT: The woman glares back and forth across the
troupe of you and goes, "Well then, some of you

00:30:43.484 --> 00:30:50.762
"come onto the ship, the rest, take it into shore
with Bouldergut." Points to the ogre, and the ogre

00:30:50.762 --> 00:30:56.197
goes, "(grunts) To shore."

00:30:56.197 --> 00:31:05.820
TRAVIS: Jesus. Do you think you can accommodate
seven of us on your two craft?

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:08.343
MATT: "Do you not have a ship of yourself?"

00:31:08.343 --> 00:31:09.381
TRAVIS: Do we?

00:31:09.381 --> 00:31:10.581
LAURA: I mean, we have this boat.

00:31:10.581 --> 00:31:11.644
SAM: We have a rowboat.

00:31:11.644 --> 00:31:12.476
MATT: You have a rowboat.

00:31:12.476 --> 00:31:14.631
TRAVIS: We have a rowboat.

00:31:14.651 --> 00:31:16.340
[laughter]

00:31:16.482 --> 00:31:19.763
TRAVIS: We will accompany you to The Squalleater.

00:31:19.763 --> 00:31:23.891
MATT: "Then come, please." She immediately starts
to climb down with the help of Bouldergut the

00:31:23.891 --> 00:31:30.001
ogre. Down into one boat, the helper that she was
with goes down with her, and there are now the two

00:31:30.001 --> 00:31:33.340
rowboats and the rowboat that you have at your
disposal. It looks like the ogre is staying

00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:38.721
onboard to help whoever's behind take The Mistake
to shore.

00:31:38.721 --> 00:31:46.509
TRAVIS: I'll turn to the rest of the crew and be
like, just do whatever, she-- he?-- she says.

00:31:46.509 --> 00:31:55.709
MATT: (snarls) Big, big grin. The rest of the
crew, who has known you for three days, goes like, "Huh."

00:31:55.709 --> 00:31:58.950
They start getting the ropes ready, start pulling
the anchor up.

00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:06.659
TRAVIS: Nott, make sure that Caleb comes with us.
He's awful grumpy below decks. He needs to be on

00:32:06.659 --> 00:32:10.301
the part of the boat with us.

00:32:10.301 --> 00:32:11.454
SAM: You want me to go get Caleb?

00:32:11.454 --> 00:32:12.511
TRAVIS: Yeah, go get fucking Caleb!

00:32:12.511 --> 00:32:14.493
SAM: Okay, okay!

00:32:14.493 --> 00:32:17.320
[laughter]

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:21.637
SAM: I think in addition to your throat getting
slashed, you might've sustained a bump on the head

00:32:21.637 --> 00:32:25.442
or something. I'll go get Caleb. I run
downstairs.

00:32:25.442 --> 00:32:27.972
TRAVIS: He's a terrifying fighter. Just make sure
he's on the boats!

00:32:27.972 --> 00:32:29.211
SAM: I'll go get Caleb.

00:32:29.211 --> 00:32:33.696
MATT: Okay. As you're sitting there concentrating
with all this going on, the tension of what we

00:32:33.696 --> 00:32:39.450
were just told by Fjord a moment ago, you watch as
Nott runs down to grab you.

00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:43.804
LIAM: Yeah, I'm inside a giant sphere of glass,
basically.

00:32:43.804 --> 00:32:48.439
SAM: Can you keep it going, but not be here?
Because we have to go. We have to go.

00:32:48.439 --> 00:32:56.677
LIAM: No, I cannot do that. I have to stay here in
this bubble or the boat will sink, presumably.

00:32:56.677 --> 00:33:00.993
SAM: Will it sink quickly or slowly?

00:33:00.993 --> 00:33:06.581
LIAM: Well it lasted between ten and 20 minutes
while I got this going, but I am not a boat

00:33:06.581 --> 00:33:12.277
expert. That's Fjord's MO, so I can't say for
certain how long this will stay afloat, no.

00:33:12.277 --> 00:33:18.751
SAM: Listen, we've got to make this decision on
our own. He's entrusted me to come get you. We

00:33:18.751 --> 00:33:27.843
have to go on this boat with these pirates, or
else we'll all be killed. Can you just temp it in,

00:33:27.843 --> 00:33:35.241
just like, rough it in? Just sort of close the
wound as much as you can.

00:33:35.241 --> 00:33:41.189
LIAM: Nein, I cannot do that, but I could walk
away from this. Are we all leaving? There are

00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:42.913
actually pirates above?

00:33:42.913 --> 00:33:46.387
SAM: There are real pirates. We're going to get on
a boat with them and go to another, to see other

00:33:46.387 --> 00:33:57.910
pirates, but everything's okay. Everything's going
to be fine, because Fjord has convinced them that

00:33:57.910 --> 00:34:06.081
he's the guy that we killed before, except with a
massive throat laceration.

00:34:06.081 --> 00:34:15.131
LIAM: Okay. I am trying to process this as quickly
as I can. I'm glad that I spent all the time

00:34:15.131 --> 00:34:21.490
making this. Let's go, fuck it. I walk out of
Leomund's Tiny Hut. It goes (whooshes), gone.

00:34:21.490 --> 00:34:27.036
MATT: Okay, you watch as this sphere immediately
vanishes as you exit the exterior of it, and what

00:34:27.036 --> 00:34:31.332
brief repairs were placed against there seem to
hold for the time being. There is a slow leak. You

00:34:31.332 --> 00:34:36.125
do see it is taking on water, but it is, at the
moment, a trickle.

00:34:36.125 --> 00:34:40.990
LAURA: Is Gallan still down there fixing it up?

00:34:40.990 --> 00:34:47.133
MATT: In the rest of this journey when you came
out of the reef, Gallan had done his best to

00:34:47.133 --> 00:34:53.008
repair it, but there's only so much you can patch
something like that. It may hold for a while, who

00:34:53.008 --> 00:34:59.844
knows? Gallan literally as this is happening sees
the leak and goes like, "Okay, you know, this is--

00:34:59.844 --> 00:35:06.595
"it should work. As long as we don't stay out here
for too long, I think we'll be okay."

00:35:06.595 --> 00:35:11.801
LIAM: Yeah. As we go up topside, I say quietly to
Nott: You know, I did not allow for Gallan to go

00:35:11.801 --> 00:35:14.799
inside the bubble, so it's all the same to him,
let's go.

00:35:14.799 --> 00:35:17.628
SAM: All right, let's go.

00:35:17.628 --> 00:35:20.340
MATT: "Great, perfect. Have fun wherever you're
going."

00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:23.227
SAM: Oh yeah, you'll be fine down here. We'll send
word soon.

00:35:23.227 --> 00:35:25.295
MATT: "You said something about pirates?"

00:35:25.295 --> 00:35:39.052
SAM: (clears throat) No. High rats. There were
rats on the top of the mast and we took care of them.

00:35:39.052 --> 00:35:41.637
MATT: Make a deception check.

00:35:41.637 --> 00:35:43.390
TRAVIS: No good at these.

00:35:43.390 --> 00:35:45.430
SAM: 16.

00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:49.532
MATT: He goes, "Oh, I mean, I hate fucking rats."

00:35:49.532 --> 00:35:50.570
SAM: Yeah.

00:35:50.570 --> 00:35:53.692
MATT: "I'm glad you took care of them. That gets
real bad as far as the food stores down here in

00:35:53.692 --> 00:35:55.855
"the cargo hold. Thank you for that."

00:35:55.855 --> 00:35:57.059
SAM: Aye aye.

00:35:57.059 --> 00:36:02.451
MATT: "All right, toodaloo!" Sits down and gets
himself an orange, unaware.

00:36:02.451 --> 00:36:05.060
TRAVIS: That poor bastard.

00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:10.074
MATT: All right. You guys make your way back to
the deck of the ship.

00:36:10.074 --> 00:36:14.263
LIAM: Yeah, and going up also, I grab hold of that
leather thong that's tied around my thigh and I

00:36:14.263 --> 00:36:16.648
cast Mage Armor on the way up.

00:36:16.648 --> 00:36:17.831
MATT: Okay, good to know.

00:36:17.831 --> 00:36:21.553
LAURA: Ooh. Leather thong!

00:36:23.737 --> 00:36:26.796
MATT: I hope that's written in your inventory.

00:36:26.796 --> 00:36:34.454
MARISHA: Hey Caleb. I took Frumpkin and I threw
him overboard to go spy on things. If you do that

00:36:34.454 --> 00:36:43.082
thing where you get all hazy, we might see shit.
Don't do it right now! Wait till we're on the-- yeah.

00:36:43.082 --> 00:36:44.446
LIAM: Okay.

00:36:44.633 --> 00:36:48.176
MARISHA: Your bird's spying on pirates.

00:36:48.176 --> 00:36:50.922
LIAM: Tally ho.

00:36:50.922 --> 00:36:51.698
MARISHA: Okay.

00:36:51.698 --> 00:36:53.770
MATT: All right, so are you all getting in the
boats, or are some of you staying behind?

00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:55.113
What's the plan?

00:36:55.113 --> 00:36:56.947
LAURA: Let's all get in the boats.

00:36:56.947 --> 00:36:58.918
TALIESIN: I think better together than not.

00:36:58.918 --> 00:37:03.685
MATT: All righty. All of you make your way down
into one of the three boats, and begin rowing your

00:37:03.685 --> 00:37:11.008
way across this gulf to the ship. Now as you
approach this ship, you can see it's a massive,

00:37:11.008 --> 00:37:20.517
tri-mast ship. You can see where those doors were
open, there are large, heavy cannons facing your direction.

00:37:20.517 --> 00:37:22.374
TRAVIS: Coming out of the gun port?

00:37:22.374 --> 00:37:30.641
[cheering]

00:37:30.641 --> 00:37:33.752
MATT: Yeah. I'm so proud of you.

00:37:33.752 --> 00:37:36.706
LAURA: Travis, you look really hot.

00:37:36.706 --> 00:37:42.505
[cheering]

00:37:42.505 --> 00:37:46.945
LIAM: (mocking) Ha ha. You're so pretty!

00:37:47.802 --> 00:37:52.109
MATT: From the gun ports on the gun deck or the
tween deck, as it's sometimes called.

00:37:52.109 --> 00:37:57.580
[cheering]

00:37:57.580 --> 00:38:07.561
MATT: Anyway, so, as you make your way towards
this massive ship, the large rope-- I want to say

00:38:07.561 --> 00:38:13.855
a ladder more than a giant net-looking ladder, is
thrown over the side that hits and breaks the

00:38:13.855 --> 00:38:18.781
surface for a bit so that it floats. The boats
come up to the side and the older woman is inside

00:38:18.781 --> 00:38:24.211
the boat, gives a look to the rest of you and
goes, "After you."

00:38:24.211 --> 00:38:26.038
LAURA: Arr.

00:38:26.038 --> 00:38:28.251
TRAVIS: I'll go first.

00:38:28.251 --> 00:38:32.254
SAM: I think it's women and children first that
are supposed to go, actually.

00:38:32.254 --> 00:38:34.660
TRAVIS: No, that's not right at all.

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:36.657
SAM: Okay.

00:38:36.657 --> 00:38:41.092
MATT: All right.

00:38:41.092 --> 00:38:42.350
SAM: You'll go first, Fjord?

00:38:42.350 --> 00:38:47.174
TRAVIS: Sure. Yep, I mean, yes.

00:38:47.174 --> 00:38:52.193
MATT: As you guys are climbing, you see The
Mistake is now being led over towards shore. You

00:38:52.193 --> 00:38:56.597
make your way to the top of the deck, and as you
come across, one by one, you see there waiting for

00:38:56.597 --> 00:39:07.465
you is about ten figures, all in various scattered
bits of seafaring attire, leathers and billowing

00:39:07.465 --> 00:39:14.166
cloths that seem to have seen many a journey out
here on the open Lucidian Ocean. Immediately, your

00:39:14.166 --> 00:39:24.697
attention is grabbed by the central figure, a
female elf, with light brown skin, with red, wild

00:39:24.697 --> 00:39:30.209
hair that falls in clustered strings around her
face and down the back. You see she's wearing a

00:39:30.209 --> 00:39:36.690
long, sleeveless gray coat with a high collar that
bends at the edge of the shoulders, with a thick

00:39:36.690 --> 00:39:44.334
scarf around her neck. You see she has heavy
elbow-length gloves and knee-high boots that look

00:39:44.334 --> 00:39:52.035
weathered with use and probably brutality. They
are stained in places where that could only have

00:39:52.035 --> 00:40:00.627
been acquired by meeting the face of somebody
else. As you step up, she has her arms crossed in

00:40:00.627 --> 00:40:06.247
front of her, cocks her head to the side and looks
to you specifically and goes, (french accent)

00:40:06.247 --> 00:40:15.116
"Well hello, Captain. You have returned from
your journey, Jawgrasp?"

00:40:15.116 --> 00:40:16.914
TRAVIS: Oui.

00:40:16.914 --> 00:40:22.262
[laughter, cheering]

00:40:26.592 --> 00:40:33.643
TRAVIS: We suffered heavy damage and casualties,
but we have returned, successful.

00:40:33.643 --> 00:40:39.538
MATT: "Successful? Well wondrous. Please, give me
the item requested."

00:40:39.538 --> 00:40:47.710
[laughter]

00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:53.061
MARISHA: Sorry, when he means successful, he means
unsuccessful.

00:40:53.061 --> 00:40:55.234
MATT: "Who are you?"

00:40:55.283 --> 00:40:57.643
MARISHA: ... I'm...

00:40:57.643 --> 00:41:01.742
MATT: "Captain, it would appear to me that you
have brought The Mist all this way across our

00:41:01.742 --> 00:41:07.338
"specific route through the reef with a crew that I
have not met, please introduce me."

00:41:07.393 --> 00:41:16.669
TRAVIS: Oh, yes, we actually came under such heavy
heat we had to rebrand the ship as The Mistake.

00:41:16.669 --> 00:41:19.415
MATT: "This surprises me not at all."

00:41:19.415 --> 00:41:25.548
[laughter]

00:41:25.548 --> 00:41:30.829
TRAVIS: Yeah. Yep. We came across some new crew.
May I introduce--

00:41:30.829 --> 00:41:32.243
MARISHA: Tracy.

00:41:32.243 --> 00:41:39.136
[laughter, cheering]

00:41:39.136 --> 00:41:41.750
MARISHA: Tracy the bowman.

00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:47.143
TRAVIS: Tracy Bowman. Next to Tracy you will
see...

00:41:48.819 --> 00:41:50.615
LIAM: Oh, Phillip.

00:41:50.615 --> 00:41:57.684
[laughter, cheering]

00:41:57.684 --> 00:42:05.530
LIAM: My name is Phillip. Bone-jour.

00:42:06.137 --> 00:42:12.741
TRAVIS: Phillip is a talented bosun. May I also
introduce the tall and powerful--

00:42:13.341 --> 00:42:16.515
ASHLEY: Hello, my name is Janet.

00:42:16.515 --> 00:42:21.495
[laughter]

00:42:21.495 --> 00:42:22.597
SAM: What'd she say?

00:42:22.597 --> 00:42:23.509
LAURA: Janet.

00:42:23.509 --> 00:42:24.472
SAM: Oh, Janet.

00:42:24.472 --> 00:42:34.732
ASHLEY: I do various things on the ship for him,
and you know, so many things. Just all of the

00:42:34.732 --> 00:42:37.301
things that need to be done.

00:42:37.301 --> 00:42:39.341
[laughter]

00:42:39.341 --> 00:42:44.573
MATT: She nods along, with a very confused look on
her face.

00:42:44.573 --> 00:42:46.027
ASHLEY: Argh.

00:42:46.027 --> 00:42:48.558
[laughter]

00:42:48.558 --> 00:42:51.782
MARISHA: That's good. She's great.

00:42:51.782 --> 00:42:55.431
LIAM: We're all going to die.

00:42:55.431 --> 00:43:01.227
TALIESIN: Cornelius, and I apologize for the way
I'm dressed right now. I was in the middle of--

00:43:01.227 --> 00:43:08.010
well, it's obvious I was making a stew, this
really nice vegetable stew, and everything went

00:43:08.010 --> 00:43:11.113
topsy-turvy so quick, I don't even--

00:43:11.113 --> 00:43:14.343
ASHLEY: It was so good.

00:43:14.343 --> 00:43:15.655
TALIESIN: It's very good stew.

00:43:15.655 --> 00:43:17.731
ASHLEY: He's very talented.

00:43:17.731 --> 00:43:22.888
TRAVIS: He's a talented cook, that one. What was
your name again?

00:43:22.888 --> 00:43:24.062
TALIESIN: Cornelius.

00:43:24.062 --> 00:43:27.099
TRAVIS: Corneli-- yeah, the food just blows your
mind.

00:43:27.099 --> 00:43:29.366
TALIESIN: Sometimes they call me Stew because I--

00:43:29.366 --> 00:43:36.692
MATT: "Cornelius. Very well, I look forward to
seeing what you are capable of cooking up, Cornelius."

00:43:36.692 --> 00:43:39.488
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm very excited.

00:43:39.488 --> 00:43:42.030
MATT: "This one?"

00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:43.909
LAURA: I'm a pirate!

00:43:43.909 --> 00:43:53.619
[laughter, cheering]

00:43:53.619 --> 00:43:56.277
SAM: hashtag I'm A Pirate.

00:43:57.168 --> 00:44:00.863
LAURA: I'm Pirate Sapphire.

00:44:00.863 --> 00:44:04.854
AUDIENCE: Aww.

00:44:04.854 --> 00:44:07.442
MATT: "She's adorable."

00:44:07.442 --> 00:44:09.804
LAURA: Argh, thanks.

00:44:09.804 --> 00:44:11.615
MATT: "What about this little runt you brought
on?"

00:44:11.615 --> 00:44:13.024
SAM: I'm Gilligan.

00:44:13.024 --> 00:44:20.889
[laughter, cheering]

00:44:20.889 --> 00:44:33.288
SAM: I was told this was only going to be about
three hours long. To be honest with you, I thought

00:44:33.288 --> 00:44:41.395
we were going on a pleasure cruise. But you know,
I've met some people, and we've had a great time,

00:44:41.395 --> 00:44:50.142
and yeah. Really nice boat you got here.

00:44:50.142 --> 00:44:58.074
MATT: She turns back to you and begins to walk a
circle around you, arms behind her back now.

00:44:58.074 --> 00:45:06.073
Folded. "Jawgrasp, so you come to me with a new
crew, and you tell me that you are successful but

00:45:06.093 --> 00:45:14.889
"yet you are not. Describe to me what transpired to
prevent you from acquiring this thing you have paid for."

00:45:14.889 --> 00:45:25.013
TRAVIS: Well you see, we now know the location of
the artifact you seek. It's as good as ours.

00:45:25.013 --> 00:45:28.965
MATT: "How did this terrible, terrible thing
happen to you?" She reaches up and touches the

00:45:28.965 --> 00:45:29.931
side of your neck.

00:45:29.931 --> 00:45:30.951
TRAVIS: Oh god.

00:45:30.951 --> 00:45:32.004
MATT: Her hand passes through--

00:45:32.004 --> 00:45:33.642
TRAVIS: It's real sore.

00:45:33.642 --> 00:45:36.697
MATT: --the illusion, and she steps back and
goes...

00:45:36.697 --> 00:45:42.063
[groaning]

00:45:42.063 --> 00:45:45.704
LAURA: Shit, shit, shit.

00:45:45.704 --> 00:45:51.088
TRAVIS: All part of the plan.

00:45:51.088 --> 00:45:55.206
MATT: "I must commend you, it has been a very long
time since someone has been so bold with such

00:45:55.206 --> 00:46:04.647
"massive balls to come onto my ship. And I think
that perhaps I got where I am today not by seeing

00:46:04.647 --> 00:46:08.752
"through a few paltry illusions."

00:46:08.752 --> 00:46:14.650
TRAVIS: Well, I must commend you on your
perceptiveness. My balls are quite large.

00:46:14.650 --> 00:46:24.548
[cheering]

00:46:24.548 --> 00:46:27.000
TRAVIS: I will drop the mask.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:32.336
MATT: You drop the the Disguise Self, okay. As you
say that and the Disguise Self drops, you hear a

00:46:32.336 --> 00:46:38.581
series of sounds that you hadn't really heard in
succession before. (clicking)

00:46:38.581 --> 00:46:40.303
[groaning]

00:46:40.303 --> 00:46:45.075
MATT: As you see most of the crew now wielding
some variation of the firearms you had seen both

00:46:45.075 --> 00:46:51.551
in Hupperdook or the traveling armies of the
Empire eastward towards the boundaries of Xhorhas.

00:46:51.551 --> 00:46:56.242
[laughter]

00:46:56.242 --> 00:47:01.560
MATT: Have them trained on the lot of you. The
captain still now has her hands crossed in front

00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:09.582
of you and goes, "Well, I guess now that we are
out in the open, who the fuck are you and how did

00:47:09.582 --> 00:47:12.813
"you come in the possession of The Mist?"

00:47:12.813 --> 00:47:17.232
TRAVIS: That is a wonderful story. One that I
would love to share. You have the honor of being

00:47:17.232 --> 00:47:20.123
in the company of The Mighty Nein.

00:47:20.123 --> 00:47:27.230
[cheering]

00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:29.677
MATT: "But there are only seven of you."

00:47:29.677 --> 00:47:36.969
[laughter]

00:47:36.969 --> 00:47:43.535
TRAVIS: It's a long story, but I'm afraid we won't
be able to tell it or further converse unless we

00:47:43.535 --> 00:47:49.635
have an atmosphere of equal exchange here, and
this hostile act is not a step in the right

00:47:49.635 --> 00:47:51.733
direction, Captain.

00:47:51.733 --> 00:47:57.241
MATT: "So you are the captain of that ship. Are
you suggesting that we parlay?"

00:47:57.241 --> 00:48:00.229
[laughter]

00:48:00.229 --> 00:48:05.087
MARISHA: Yes. Say yes, Fjord. Say yes.

00:48:05.087 --> 00:48:07.406
TRAVIS: Yes.

00:48:08.657 --> 00:48:18.297
MATT: "Very well. Well, since you've been so
forthright, Tracy, Phillip, Sapphire, Cornelius,

00:48:18.297 --> 00:48:25.308
"Janet, and Gilli-gone?"

00:48:25.308 --> 00:48:31.085
TRAVIS: (laughs) Gilli-gone? Hon hon.

00:48:31.085 --> 00:48:46.321
MATT: "Welcome aboard the Squalleater. I am
Captain Avantika. Now, the fact that you are here,

00:48:46.321 --> 00:48:51.236
"that you've made your way across the reef, that
you managed to best our sister ship and the crew

00:48:51.236 --> 00:48:53.925
"on board, which I assume have all been
dispatched?"

00:48:53.925 --> 00:48:55.552
TRAVIS: Indeed.

00:48:55.552 --> 00:49:01.542
LIAM: Just out of curiosity, if I look back over
my shoulder, do I still see a boat?

00:49:01.542 --> 00:49:04.224
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah!

00:49:04.224 --> 00:49:10.483
[laughter]

00:49:10.483 --> 00:49:11.769
MATT: You do, you do.

00:49:11.769 --> 00:49:15.606
[cheering]

00:49:15.606 --> 00:49:22.280
MATT: It's noticeably lower. In maybe a short ten
minute period, it'll be finding its way onto the beach.

00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:24.716
TRAVIS: It's also got a giant fucking ogre on it
now.

00:49:24.716 --> 00:49:27.126
MATT: Yeah.

00:49:27.126 --> 00:49:31.119
MARISHA: Can I look around real quick and see if I
see Frumpkin?

00:49:31.119 --> 00:49:33.108
MATT: Make a Perception check.

00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:43.224
MARISHA: Sleeves are so big. Shit. I think that
was an eight?

00:49:43.224 --> 00:49:45.062
TRAVIS: Get your hat out of the way.

00:49:45.062 --> 00:49:48.749
MARISHA: This is not a good dice for this
lighting. 11.

00:49:48.749 --> 00:49:54.505
MATT: You look around real fast and you see a few
birds are perched up in the sails, but you don't

00:49:54.505 --> 00:49:58.496
know which one's Frumpkin, if Frumpkin's up there.
One of them does look small, might be him.

00:49:58.496 --> 00:50:02.283
MARISHA: I lost another fucking owl, goddamn it.

00:50:02.283 --> 00:50:10.290
LIAM: I hear her say that, and for ten or 15
seconds, jump into Frumpkin's vision to see what I see.

00:50:10.290 --> 00:50:14.236
MATT: Right now you look up and you can see
through Frumpkin's vision, down on the deck,

00:50:14.236 --> 00:50:23.282
Frumpkin has a view from above and is present. The
captain continues. "Well, then my next question

00:50:23.282 --> 00:50:30.643
"is, what are you planning here? Why have you gone
to all this trouble to kill my crew, to bring the

00:50:30.643 --> 00:50:38.033
"ship right back to me and then, to be perfectly
honest, prostrate yourself before us?"

00:50:38.033 --> 00:50:44.030
TRAVIS: Well I imagine there must be a hefty
reward for the item that you seek. We went through

00:50:44.085 --> 00:50:46.783
great troubles just to acquire it.

00:50:46.783 --> 00:50:48.376
MATT: "Troubles?"

00:50:48.376 --> 00:50:50.229
TRAVIS: Perhaps.

00:50:50.229 --> 00:50:53.961
MATT: "Do you know the purpose of this item?"

00:50:53.961 --> 00:50:55.145
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:50:55.145 --> 00:51:01.316
[laughter]

00:51:01.316 --> 00:51:08.437
MATT: She looks at you with an eye that has tore
through a thousand lies, and gives a surprising

00:51:08.437 --> 00:51:18.049
smile of acknowledgement. "Interesting. Well,
you've proven that you are talented, at least, to

00:51:18.049 --> 00:51:26.256
"have survived this far. But I'm a bigger fan of
loyalty. Talent and loyalty, well, that is

00:51:26.256 --> 00:51:37.914
"obviously my birthday. As it stands, The Mighty
Nein, there are two paths you can walk. You, one,

00:51:37.914 --> 00:51:43.312
"could live under the crew and proves yourselves as
both skilled and as trustworthy as I hope you may

00:51:43.312 --> 00:51:52.508
"be, if our goals are indeed aligned. Perhaps even
join us, if the deeds please me. Or two, we weigh

00:51:52.508 --> 00:51:56.992
"your corpses down with rocks and leave you here
amongst the reef."

00:51:56.992 --> 00:51:59.090
LAURA: Those are the only options there?

00:51:59.266 --> 00:52:01.516
[laughter]

00:52:01.516 --> 00:52:03.658
MATT: "I'm afraid so, little Sapphire."

00:52:03.658 --> 00:52:05.367
LAURA: Cool.

00:52:06.247 --> 00:52:10.560
MATT: "Captain, what was your actual name?"

00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:11.651
TRAVIS: Fjord.

00:52:11.651 --> 00:52:14.690
MATT: "Captain Fjord. What'll it be?"

00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:19.620
TRAVIS: It's actually Captain Tusktooth, but--
(clears throat)

00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:22.231
MATT: "We'll stick with Fjord."

00:52:22.231 --> 00:52:30.229
TRAVIS: Cornelius, what say you in this highly
delicate matter?

00:52:31.109 --> 00:52:35.800
TALIESIN: I don't know, I've got some very
specific burial needs, if we're actually going to

00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:37.254
go that way.

00:52:37.254 --> 00:52:45.774
[laughter and cheering]

00:52:45.774 --> 00:52:51.008
TALIESIN: I'm unhappy with everything at the
moment. I would really like to negotiate some base

00:52:51.008 --> 00:52:54.873
points of this deal.

00:52:54.873 --> 00:53:00.158
MATT: At the moment you say this, you feel this
cold sensation in the back of your skull as one of

00:53:00.158 --> 00:53:03.639
the cocked rifles is now pressed up against the
base of the head.

00:53:03.639 --> 00:53:05.551
TALIESIN: Do I know what a rifle is?

00:53:05.551 --> 00:53:06.333
MATT: You have a no idea.

00:53:06.333 --> 00:53:07.693
LAURA: You know what a co--

00:53:07.693 --> 00:53:13.281
TALIESIN: Ah, that's cold. (laughs) Oh, that's
really cold. Oh, ooh.

00:53:13.281 --> 00:53:20.588
MATT: She goes, "There is no negotiation. I'm
sorry, but the choice you make now, that is--"

00:53:20.588 --> 00:53:28.571
TRAVIS: That is not necessary. We would absolutely
love to prove our loyalty in your service.

00:53:28.571 --> 00:53:37.538
SAM: I would say this, though. Just as a curious
tourist, if you were to kill us you would not find

00:53:37.538 --> 00:53:42.555
the location of the item.

00:53:44.037 --> 00:53:47.836
MATT: "Well, based on the fact that you brought
yourselves this far to tell me that you have it, I

00:53:47.836 --> 00:53:51.290
"would assume that it's somewhere either on your
ship across the way that I currently am in

00:53:51.290 --> 00:53:55.629
"possession of, or it's on your person, so we could
rummage through your bodies to find it afterwards."

00:53:55.629 --> 00:54:03.506
[laughter]

00:54:03.506 --> 00:54:10.384
MARISHA: How far would that rummaging entail? Just
curious how far you would look.

00:54:10.384 --> 00:54:12.463
LAURA: Have you ever seen The Fifth Element?

00:54:12.463 --> 00:54:24.071
[laughter, cheering]

00:54:24.071 --> 00:54:28.244
LAURA: It's a really popular play, I don't...

00:54:28.244 --> 00:54:33.018
MATT: "I'm afraid I'm not as involved in the arts
as some, perhaps." She puts her hand up and raises

00:54:33.018 --> 00:54:36.679
her fingers twice, and you feel the pressure of
the barrel back off, and all the guns eventually,

00:54:36.679 --> 00:54:44.978
they stay trained on you, but they pull back a bit
and go lax a little bit. "Do you agree?"

00:54:44.978 --> 00:54:49.713
SAM: We don't have a choice, so yes, yes.

00:54:49.713 --> 00:54:51.793
TRAVIS: It's a resounding yes, of course.

00:54:51.793 --> 00:54:52.686
LAURA: Yeah.

00:54:52.686 --> 00:54:59.029
MATT: "Well then, Mighty Nein, welcome to the
Squalleater." (claps) All the guns pull back a

00:54:59.029 --> 00:55:02.777
bit. Everyone stays present, and they're keeping
an eye on you. As much as this agreement has

00:55:02.777 --> 00:55:09.650
happened, there's still a sense of careful
watchfulness from the crew, but Avantika seems to

00:55:09.650 --> 00:55:14.080
drop that intensity and reaches forward a hand to
shake yours.

00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:23.150
SAM: Do we pick our quarters first? Or do we get
assigned roles? Or is there a uniform that we need to wear?

00:55:23.150 --> 00:55:29.212
TALIESIN: Does the yogurt come before or after?
Really looking forward to that.

00:55:29.212 --> 00:55:31.831
MATT: "If you're hungry, there are plenty of
fruits that have dropped from the trees on the

00:55:31.831 --> 00:55:36.729
"island. First order of business, some of my men
are going to work to begin repairing my other

00:55:36.729 --> 00:55:44.934
"ship. In the meantime, you relax, bring your
things aboard. I would like to question some of

00:55:44.934 --> 00:55:48.379
"you about what you know."

00:55:48.379 --> 00:55:50.836
TRAVIS: By all means.

00:55:50.836 --> 00:55:57.057
LIAM: Hey guys, let's steal a boat. It'll be so
much fun.

00:55:57.057 --> 00:56:02.032
[laughter]

00:56:02.032 --> 00:56:09.334
MATT: As the captain turns to the older woman who
accompanied you and goes, "Vera. Let me introduce

00:56:09.334 --> 00:56:13.393
"you to your charges for the evening."

00:56:13.393 --> 00:56:14.337
TRAVIS: Vera?

00:56:14.337 --> 00:56:15.188
(mic thuds)

00:56:15.188 --> 00:56:16.374
TRAVIS: Oh, Jesus!

00:56:16.374 --> 00:56:17.406
LIAM: Caleb died!

00:56:17.406 --> 00:56:21.259
LAURA: Which one of us was shot?! Caduceus has
been shot!

00:56:21.259 --> 00:56:23.558
[laughter]

00:56:23.558 --> 00:56:33.890
SAM: Sorry, guys. We've never been on stage
before. It's a learning curve. We'll figure it out.

00:56:33.890 --> 00:56:41.397
MATT: The captain, "I will return in just a little
bit, but in the meantime, Vera can answer your

00:56:41.397 --> 00:56:45.965
"questions. Don't do anything stupid."

00:56:45.965 --> 00:56:47.808
LAURA: Never.

00:56:48.809 --> 00:56:54.590
MATT: "Good." The captain steps down into her
quarters, and Vera approaches and looks you all

00:56:54.590 --> 00:57:04.868
over with a very intense glare. "All right, so.
Welcome. Are you hungry?"

00:57:04.868 --> 00:57:06.593
SAM: Always, yes, of course.

00:57:06.593 --> 00:57:07.460
TRAVIS: Yeah yeah.

00:57:07.460 --> 00:57:08.577
TALIESIN: Usually.

00:57:08.577 --> 00:57:13.284
MATT: "With me." She turns around and begins to
leave. You begin to see in the distance another

00:57:13.284 --> 00:57:19.232
boat. One of the boats that you guys had taken to
the ship has made its way in the direction of The

00:57:19.232 --> 00:57:23.916
Mistake. What would you like to do while you're
here on the ship?

00:57:23.916 --> 00:57:33.127
TRAVIS: I'll make my way over to Janet-- Yasha and
take her by the arm and say, you okay with this?

00:57:33.127 --> 00:57:41.730
ASHLEY: Well I don't know if I trust her, or what
she wants with the sphere. Maybe you should ask

00:57:41.730 --> 00:57:46.246
her if she knows what it does?

00:57:46.246 --> 00:57:51.191
TRAVIS: If I ask her about it. Let her know that I
don't know anything.

00:57:51.203 --> 00:57:54.174
ASHLEY: Shit.

00:57:54.174 --> 00:57:56.086
TRAVIS: Oh, you don't think she'd believe me?

00:57:56.086 --> 00:57:59.827
LAURA: Well, what if one of us asked her what it
does? Like you won't tell us or something.

00:57:59.827 --> 00:58:00.908
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

00:58:00.908 --> 00:58:05.341
TRAVIS: That's a fine idea. Yeah, like I hoard the
information?

00:58:05.341 --> 00:58:10.336
LAURA: Yeah. I like that you brought Yasha aside
and then all of us just--

00:58:10.336 --> 00:58:11.655
TALIESIN: Jumped right in.

00:58:11.655 --> 00:58:13.234
SAM: Sorry.

00:58:13.234 --> 00:58:15.619
LAURA: Sorry, I couldn't help but hear what you--

00:58:15.619 --> 00:58:19.552
TRAVIS: Very small ship. Yeah. Work your magic.

00:58:19.552 --> 00:58:25.303
LAURA: Okay. We're going to ask Avantika if she
will tell us.

00:58:25.303 --> 00:58:26.574
SAM: If she'll tell us?

00:58:26.574 --> 00:58:28.145
LAURA: Yeah, because he won't.

00:58:28.145 --> 00:58:30.092
SAM: But why would she tell us?

00:58:30.092 --> 00:58:31.665
LAURA: Because we're very charming.

00:58:31.665 --> 00:58:33.138
SAM: We are that. That's true.

00:58:33.138 --> 00:58:34.515
[laughter]

00:58:34.515 --> 00:58:36.842
TALIESIN: How long are we going to hold these
disguises?

00:58:36.842 --> 00:58:39.998
LAURA: Well, I think I look really good, so as
long as it lasts.

00:58:39.998 --> 00:58:41.065
TALIESIN: All right.

00:58:41.065 --> 00:58:45.273
LAURA: Then I might make my dress like this
permanently because of how sexy I am.

00:58:45.293 --> 00:58:50.383
[cheering]

00:58:50.383 --> 00:58:54.497
LIAM: Are we off on our own a little bit from
everyone training guns upon us?

00:58:54.497 --> 00:58:58.216
MATT: They're still watching you. You're still on
the deck, but you have some time to discuss or

00:58:58.216 --> 00:59:00.133
anything you want to do.

00:59:00.133 --> 00:59:03.963
TRAVIS: Not making any movements to move the ship,
it's just staying?

00:59:03.963 --> 00:59:06.060
MATT: At the moment, nothing.

00:59:06.060 --> 00:59:21.759
LIAM: What is our plan here? I'm trying to move my
lips as little as possible. We go with this for

00:59:21.759 --> 00:59:26.406
the time being? Then when the moment is right, we
get away? Or are we just pirates now?

00:59:26.406 --> 00:59:29.588
[laughter]

00:59:29.588 --> 00:59:31.901
MARISHA: I second that question.

00:59:31.901 --> 00:59:38.996
TRAVIS: Yeah, I third that question. So what I
have worked out is that we have what she needs, we

00:59:38.996 --> 00:59:45.341
got to try and find out as much as we can about
why she wants it and what it does, where does she

00:59:45.341 --> 00:59:51.948
want it for herself or is she taking it somewhere.
That's about all I got.

00:59:51.948 --> 00:59:56.285
MARISHA: Well, I want to figure out if she's just
another matchmaker or keeping it for herself if

00:59:56.285 --> 00:59:57.707
that is a thing.

00:59:57.707 --> 01:00:00.158
TRAVIS: Yeah. Oh shit, is Marius LePual back on
the other ship?

01:00:00.158 --> 01:00:01.106
MATT: Yep.

01:00:01.106 --> 01:00:02.807
MARISHA: Aw, we forgot Marius!

01:00:02.807 --> 01:00:09.528
TRAVIS: That poor bastard. Oh shit, our fucking
tortle!

01:00:09.528 --> 01:00:12.867
MARISHA: We're not leaving though, we're not
leaving anywhere. They're going to fix that ship.

01:00:12.867 --> 01:00:13.955
TRAVIS: They better not sink!

01:00:13.955 --> 01:00:19.199
LAURA: No, she said we could go back and get our
things. They're our things.

01:00:19.199 --> 01:00:20.607
TALIESIN: They need to crew that ship.

01:00:20.607 --> 01:00:21.888
TRAVIS: I like Orly. Yeah, okay.

01:00:21.888 --> 01:00:27.514
LIAM: I would warrant a guess that we are stuck
here for the time being, but I think at a certain

01:00:27.514 --> 01:00:35.598
point we are going to want to go, and if that
happens, all of you, if you see a window in which

01:00:35.598 --> 01:00:41.233
we can get away, tell Nott or myself, and we will
start a snow chain.

01:00:41.233 --> 01:00:43.866
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: A what?

01:00:43.866 --> 01:00:50.252
LIAM: We will tell our friends that it's time to
get out of here. Just find you or me, and we

01:00:50.252 --> 01:00:58.828
spread it quickly, so we don't leave anyone behind
like we almost fucked off without Caduceus, from the docks.

01:00:58.828 --> 01:01:00.368
LAURA: Sorry again about that.

01:01:00.368 --> 01:01:04.931
TALIESIN: No, that's okay. I wasn't that worried.

01:01:04.931 --> 01:01:10.273
TRAVIS: Fair enough. I feel like we can make some
ground without fighting if we have to, I feel like

01:01:10.273 --> 01:01:15.690
we can find out what we need and maybe slip away,
I think that's a great idea.

01:01:15.690 --> 01:01:21.419
MARISHA: Well, okay, but still, why would we run
if we don't know what this thing is inside of you?

01:01:21.419 --> 01:01:25.176
I'm assuming you want it out of you, right?

01:01:25.176 --> 01:01:28.428
TRAVIS: No, I kind of fucking like it, actually.

01:01:28.428 --> 01:01:30.899
MARISHA: So we just need information and then we
run?

01:01:30.899 --> 01:01:41.038
TALIESIN: Well, they're also fixing the ship. At
some point, there's two ships.

01:01:41.038 --> 01:01:43.537
LAURA: So we'd steal both of them.

01:01:43.537 --> 01:01:51.535
[cheering]

01:01:51.535 --> 01:01:55.004
TALIESIN: That's pretty cool.

01:01:55.004 --> 01:01:59.598
TRAVIS: How about, in the meantime, keep an eye on
the people around right? Watch what they're doing.

01:01:59.598 --> 01:02:06.330
The things they're doing on the mast. Rigging,
right? Try and familiarize yourself with working a boat.

01:02:06.330 --> 01:02:08.244
MARISHA: Shit, we're supposed to learn from these
people?

01:02:08.244 --> 01:02:12.203
TRAVIS: If you can.

01:02:12.203 --> 01:02:16.684
LIAM: I think for the time being, we are in fact
pirates, and that Fjord, you're absolutely

01:02:16.684 --> 01:02:22.356
correct, learn as much as possible, and when the
opportunity is right we leave, but for now, we

01:02:22.356 --> 01:02:25.641
have to swiff them, they are our new best
buddies.

01:02:25.641 --> 01:02:27.451
TRAVIS: Sure, yeah, our partners.

01:02:27.451 --> 01:02:29.260
LAURA: Captain Tusktooth.

01:02:29.260 --> 01:02:30.972
TRAVIS: Yes, Sapphire?

01:02:30.972 --> 01:02:36.673
LAURA: Could you maybe make some more of those
Idiot's Guides and spread them around through the

01:02:36.673 --> 01:02:38.590
rest of us?

01:02:38.590 --> 01:02:39.900
TRAVIS: More of the what?

01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:42.791
LAURA: Those guides that you made, the sailing
guides.

01:02:42.791 --> 01:02:48.641
[laughter]

01:02:48.641 --> 01:03:03.041
TRAVIS: This is mine. I earned this. And it's not
actually in the game!

01:03:03.041 --> 01:03:07.058
MATT: Within a short time of you guys having this
conversation, Vera returns to the deck of the ship

01:03:07.058 --> 01:03:12.388
and goes, "The captain would like you to please
join her in the quarters below, please."

01:03:12.388 --> 01:03:14.475
LAURA: All of us?

01:03:14.475 --> 01:03:17.193
MATT: "Sure."

01:03:17.193 --> 01:03:20.125
TRAVIS: It'll be our pleasure.

01:03:20.125 --> 01:03:23.165
MATT: You guys follow Vera down below to the dark,
and it takes a second for your eyes to adjust

01:03:23.165 --> 01:03:29.264
going from the bright daylight to the darker
quarters in the deck below, but you're led to the

01:03:29.264 --> 01:03:35.899
captain's quarters, this beautiful open room with
a mismatched patchwork of old carpets that have

01:03:35.899 --> 01:03:42.479
all been laid over each other from various designs
from around Exandria. There's a desk that has a

01:03:42.479 --> 01:03:47.025
bunch of carve marks into it, there's some papers
laid out, and there you can see Avantika, sitting

01:03:47.025 --> 01:03:53.203
with her legs up on the desk, currently eating on
some sort of a tropical fruit, watching you all

01:03:53.203 --> 01:04:00.501
enter with a bit of a grin on her face. "Please,
fill the space."

01:04:00.501 --> 01:04:08.388
TRAVIS: Yeah, mind if we partake of your beautiful
spread here? Is there food in this bitch?

01:04:08.388 --> 01:04:11.803
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:04:11.803 --> 01:04:13.134
TRAVIS: 14.

01:04:13.134 --> 01:04:17.409
MATT: Yes actually, on the right side of the room,
there is a small pack of freshly collected

01:04:17.409 --> 01:04:24.981
tropical fruits, there's some nuts, a cheese
that's been designed for longer travel and will

01:04:24.981 --> 01:04:29.680
keep well. "By all means, please."

01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:32.020
SAM: (gobbling)

01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:34.710
TRAVIS: That's a candle, that's a candle! Stop
eating the candle.

01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:38.489
[laughter]

01:04:38.489 --> 01:04:39.851
TALIESIN: Paring knife.

01:04:39.851 --> 01:04:41.050
TRAVIS: No, put it back.

01:04:41.050 --> 01:04:48.619
[laughter]

01:04:48.619 --> 01:04:51.721
SAM: It's a candle bar.

01:04:51.721 --> 01:04:58.813
MATT: The doors close behind you, but before the
doors close, all the rest of the crew that were

01:04:58.813 --> 01:05:02.971
armed are essentially right nearby waiting to
storm in at any given point in time.

01:05:02.971 --> 01:05:03.992
TRAVIS: Outside the door?

01:05:03.992 --> 01:05:04.790
MATT: Right outside the door.

01:05:04.790 --> 01:05:06.724
TRAVIS: Is it essentially us and the captain?

01:05:06.724 --> 01:05:09.366
MATT: It's just you and the captain, from what you
can tell. It's just you guys.

01:05:09.366 --> 01:05:17.346
MARISHA: Are there like portcullis windows? Is
that-- no? Are there windows?

01:05:17.346 --> 01:05:23.869
MATT: You see a couple of windows and a doorway
behind her that leads to a balcony that looks out

01:05:23.869 --> 01:05:26.844
the back of the ship.

01:05:26.844 --> 01:05:30.876
MARISHA: Does she have papers and shit
everywhere?

01:05:30.876 --> 01:05:34.191
MATT: You see a couple of papers. Actually, you
see a familiar-looking map.

01:05:34.191 --> 01:05:35.101
SAM: Oh!

01:05:35.101 --> 01:05:42.376
MATT: Akin to what you guys were supposed to have
last week, but the mail service decided not to

01:05:42.376 --> 01:05:48.121
have it. We have the map of the Menagerie Coast
and another map that has a similar layout to what

01:05:48.121 --> 01:05:54.882
you found mostly burned in The Mist. As well as a
few other pieces of paper that appear to be tucked

01:05:54.882 --> 01:05:57.187
away into portions of the desk.

01:05:57.187 --> 01:06:02.669
MARISHA: While they're having a conversation, I
want to do a scan and see if I can see any

01:06:02.669 --> 01:06:08.104
floorboards that look like they can be popped up,
maybe marks on the floor from chests, anything

01:06:08.104 --> 01:06:11.118
that looks like it could be a secret compartment.

01:06:11.118 --> 01:06:15.690
MATT: Make an investigation check. Actually, this
would be a perception check. It's just a glance,

01:06:15.690 --> 01:06:19.669
but it's going to be a higher DC. Investigation,
you'd have to actually physically rummage through

01:06:19.669 --> 01:06:21.965
the room, so make a perception check.

01:06:21.965 --> 01:06:24.958
LIAM: Also glancing around for books.

01:06:24.958 --> 01:06:29.287
MATT: Both of you make a perception check.

01:06:29.287 --> 01:06:33.553
MARISHA: Yep, that's balls, big balls. Fjord-size
balls.

01:06:33.553 --> 01:06:36.747
MATT: You rolled balls?

01:06:36.747 --> 01:06:37.932
MARISHA: Eight.

01:06:37.932 --> 01:06:42.441
MATT: Going to get you a d20, that instead of a
one, it has a pair of balls. Right there, yeah. An

01:06:42.441 --> 01:06:46.740
eight? The room looks pretty solidly made, and the
floorboard, while there are scuffs to it, there's

01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:51.496
nothing that gives you the idea that there would
be any hidden compartment or any sort of small

01:06:51.496 --> 01:06:53.754
cubby that would be out of view. What'd you get?

01:06:53.754 --> 01:06:55.961
LIAM: Big 11.

01:06:55.961 --> 01:07:01.980
MATT: You do see two books that are laying on the
shelf to your left amongst a set of candles.

01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:07.076
There's a small lantern. You see a set of
navigation tools that are barely poking out of a

01:07:07.076 --> 01:07:12.935
small wooden box. Yeah, there are two books there.
You can't quite see the binder, or if there is

01:07:12.935 --> 01:07:17.911
anything written on the sides. It's pretty
plain-bound. Anyways, the door's closed. The

01:07:17.911 --> 01:07:23.064
captain looks to you and goes, "All right, so now
that you've agreed to become our friend, I would

01:07:23.064 --> 01:07:28.017
"like to see the first test of you proving your
loyalty. You have this item I require? You have it

01:07:28.017 --> 01:07:30.365
"here? Where is it?"

01:07:30.365 --> 01:07:37.701
SAM: It's very dangerous. Before we tell you
anything about it, we want to make sure that you

01:07:37.701 --> 01:07:40.334
know how to handle it.

01:07:40.334 --> 01:07:48.321
MATT: (laughs) "Little goblin girl, trust me. I
have a decent idea of what I'm doing."

01:07:48.321 --> 01:08:04.367
SAM: A decent idea? We've seen it do things, scary
things. We've seen someone melt while touching it.

01:08:04.367 --> 01:08:08.835
MATT: Make a deception check.

01:08:10.083 --> 01:08:19.128
SAM: That's a 12. Oh, minus three. A nine.

01:08:19.128 --> 01:08:27.792
MATT: She goes-- nein-- "Oh my goodness, that
sounds terrible. Well, obviously we cannot have

01:08:27.792 --> 01:08:31.588
"you touching it, then."

01:08:31.588 --> 01:08:33.346
TRAVIS: If you don't mind my asking--

01:08:33.346 --> 01:08:36.239
MATT: "Please, cut through the bullshit for me,
please, Captain Fjord."

01:08:36.239 --> 01:08:40.114
TRAVIS: Tusktooth.

01:08:40.114 --> 01:08:44.135
MATT: "Will you tell me if I call you Tusktooth?"

01:08:44.135 --> 01:08:46.002
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:51.082
MATT: "Then, Captain Tusktooth, please tell me."

01:08:51.082 --> 01:08:56.239
[cheering]

01:08:56.239 --> 01:09:02.875
MARISHA: Don't fall for it, don't fall for it.
She's trying to use them titties. Don't fall for it.

01:09:02.875 --> 01:09:09.823
TRAVIS: I know. If I could, you seem so anxious.
When was the last time the item was in your

01:09:09.823 --> 01:09:17.370
possession? I'm so excited to reunite you with it.
I feel like if you tell us your story, we'll share

01:09:17.370 --> 01:09:19.985
in that sense of triumph.

01:09:19.985 --> 01:09:25.592
MATT: "Respectfully, you're not in a position,
once again, to negotiate. You tell me and I'll

01:09:25.592 --> 01:09:29.371
"tell you, a little back and forth. Honestly, the
one who has to prove their loyalty right now is

01:09:29.371 --> 01:09:30.779
"not myself."

01:09:30.779 --> 01:09:36.326
TRAVIS: You're correct. I have it on very good
authority that an island that is surrounded by the

01:09:36.326 --> 01:09:43.420
Deeprow Reef is housing the item you seek.

01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:48.580
MATT: "I wonder how it found its way there?" Make
a deception check.

01:09:50.669 --> 01:09:52.092
TRAVIS: 20.

01:09:52.092 --> 01:10:02.923
[cheering]

01:10:02.923 --> 01:10:06.744
MATT: "You know precisely where it lies in the
reef?"

01:10:06.744 --> 01:10:09.236
TRAVIS: I do.

01:10:09.236 --> 01:10:14.095
MATT: "Show me," and she pushes forward the map,
the same similar map to what you were given. You

01:10:14.095 --> 01:10:16.521
have it with you?

01:10:16.521 --> 01:10:24.378
TRAVIS: I do. Fuck, I picked the one reef that
doesn't have any goddamn islands. She doesn't know

01:10:24.431 --> 01:10:27.921
that, and I'm not saying this out loud.

01:10:27.921 --> 01:10:30.075
MARISHA: Secret island.

01:10:30.075 --> 01:10:36.163
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah. Oh, uncharted islands! Let's
not do that.

01:10:36.163 --> 01:10:39.875
[laughter]

01:10:39.875 --> 01:10:46.254
TRAVIS: If you make your way to the Deeprow Reef,
right off the shores of Vide Cay, you'll find an

01:10:46.254 --> 01:10:53.357
unguarded, old, ruined fort. There the item is
being protected and held.

01:10:53.357 --> 01:10:57.375
MATT: "So you stole my ship and came all this way
to tell me that this item was not in your

01:10:57.375 --> 01:11:01.607
"possession and is another place. Why were you
coming to the island? I'm very confused."

01:11:01.607 --> 01:11:07.304
TRAVIS: Well, you see, Marquis LePual let us know
that you were in dire need of it, and that there

01:11:07.304 --> 01:11:14.565
was heavy coin and glory in its delivery. Now, as
you can see, I lost my original crew and found

01:11:14.565 --> 01:11:22.651
these bunch of fuckwits. You see, I do owe them a
little bit of coin for their trouble, and I sure

01:11:22.651 --> 01:11:35.354
would hate to leave them empty-handed. Plus I want
to see what happens when you're reunited with your treasure.

01:11:35.354 --> 01:11:44.586
MATT: "Well, first off, Marius LePual is merely
a bullshit messenger, but I'm glad at least he

01:11:44.586 --> 01:11:53.659
"could bring you to us. Is that all you know about
the actual sphere?"

01:12:00.789 --> 01:12:01.986
TRAVIS: Perhaps.

01:12:02.163 --> 01:12:04.281
[laughter]

01:12:04.281 --> 01:12:09.004
MATT: She's looking right into you, lids
half-closed, this dagger stare of trying to read

01:12:09.004 --> 01:12:11.069
any sort of give.

01:12:11.069 --> 01:12:17.559
TRAVIS: Captain, I hope you understand that this
is not my first rodeo. If I were to tell you

01:12:17.559 --> 01:12:22.481
everything that I know right now, why would you
need me alive?

01:12:22.481 --> 01:12:32.242
MATT: "Very well, let's trade a bit. The object I
have not seen before, but I know of it and am

01:12:32.242 --> 01:12:39.824
"hoping to bring it to this island for a purpose. I
had recently hired an individual known as Jamedi

01:12:39.824 --> 01:12:52.789
"Cosko, a very well-established adventurer, delver
of dungeons. Cosko is a--" Not Costco.

01:12:52.789 --> 01:12:54.990
[laughter]

01:12:54.990 --> 01:12:55.694
TRAVIS: That's what I heard.

01:12:55.694 --> 01:12:56.941
MARISHA: That's what I heard, too.

01:12:56.941 --> 01:13:01.457
MATT: C-O-S-K-O, Cosko.

01:13:01.457 --> 01:13:02.671
TRAVIS: Great pizza place.

01:13:02.671 --> 01:13:06.214
MARISHA: Yeah, you can get your crew in bulk.

01:13:06.214 --> 01:13:16.387
TRAVIS: No, no, no, take it easy!

01:13:16.387 --> 01:13:23.646
MATT: "To spend a few days across the jungles of
the island to see what there is to be found there.

01:13:23.854 --> 01:13:32.801
"You see, this object, this sphere, it needs to
return. There is a temple in there that is from

01:13:32.801 --> 01:13:41.710
"long ago, and has been since refitted by its
current denizens. Something at the very bottom of

01:13:41.710 --> 01:13:52.139
"that temple requires to be reunioned, reunited
with this thing I seek. So--"

01:13:52.139 --> 01:13:55.728
LAURA: What is it, at the bottom of the temple?

01:13:55.728 --> 01:14:00.575
MATT: "Does the name Uk'otoa mean anything to
you?"

01:14:00.575 --> 01:14:08.555
TRAVIS: It sure as fuck doesn't. Could you say
that again slower?

01:14:08.555 --> 01:14:12.206
LIAM: Yeah, I'm sorry, you have a very thick
accent. Sometimes it is--

01:14:12.206 --> 01:14:19.039
[laughter]

01:14:19.039 --> 01:14:22.567
LIAM: I'm losing a couple of things here and
there, no offense.

01:14:22.567 --> 01:14:30.079
MATT: She throws a quick dagger in the direction
of Caleb that drags the cheese from his hand and

01:14:30.079 --> 01:14:32.381
sticks to the wall.

01:14:32.381 --> 01:14:33.509
LIAM: Was I eating cheese?

01:14:33.509 --> 01:14:34.275
MATT: Apparently.

01:14:34.275 --> 01:14:43.326
(laughter)

01:14:43.326 --> 01:14:45.416
MATT: You were.

01:14:45.416 --> 01:14:47.601
LIAM: My perception is so low!

01:14:47.601 --> 01:14:53.766
(laughter)

01:14:53.766 --> 01:14:57.413
TRAVIS: Stay away from the captain's cheese!

01:14:57.413 --> 01:15:00.830
LIAM: I thought that was a metaphor.

01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:04.979
MARISHA: That was a triple-aged Gouda!

01:15:04.979 --> 01:15:08.426
LAURA: No, but really, what did you say? What was
the name?

01:15:08.426 --> 01:15:17.324
MATT: Uk'otoa. Spelled U-K apostrophe O-T-O-A.
"Uk'otoa, the great leviathan."

01:15:17.324 --> 01:15:19.835
MARISHA: Gate of the leviathan?

01:15:19.835 --> 01:15:21.113
MATT: "The great leviathan."

01:15:21.113 --> 01:15:25.239
MARISHA: Oh, the great leviathan!

01:15:27.918 --> 01:15:29.597
TRAVIS: Do you know what that means?

01:15:29.597 --> 01:15:31.027
LIAM: I have a good sense of it!

01:15:31.027 --> 01:15:32.891
MARISHA: It's a fucking leviathan!

01:15:32.891 --> 01:15:36.082
TRAVIS: I don't know what the fuck that means!

01:15:36.082 --> 01:15:38.401
SAM: It's in your book!

01:15:38.401 --> 01:15:48.681
MATT: Her eyes are trained on Fjord as she says
this. "Well, you see, I am the chosen of Uk'otoa."

01:15:48.681 --> 01:15:53.575
She pulls the scarf down from under her neck, and
in the sternum, there is a tattoo of an eye.

01:15:53.575 --> 01:15:56.662
(gasping)

01:15:56.662 --> 01:16:00.190
[cheering]

01:16:00.190 --> 01:16:01.838
MARISHA: Wait, what tattoo was it? You're
Uk'otoa?

01:16:01.838 --> 01:16:02.656
TRAVIS: No, she is the chosen of--

01:16:02.656 --> 01:16:06.309
MARISHA: You're the chosen of Uk'o-- sorry. The
sound--

01:16:06.309 --> 01:16:11.585
MATT: "You see, this great serpent once ruled the
Lucidian Ocean."

01:16:11.585 --> 01:16:15.980
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) Serpent?

01:16:15.980 --> 01:16:25.451
MATT: Your reactions are killing me, Travis.
"Shortly after the Calamity washed this land clean

01:16:25.451 --> 01:16:31.957
"and Zehir, the Cloaked Serpent god, was banished
long away, one of his greatest creations was left

01:16:31.957 --> 01:16:34.902
"to rule this ocean: Uk'otoa."

01:16:34.902 --> 01:16:35.953
LAURA: (whispering) Uk'otoa!

01:16:35.953 --> 01:16:42.226
MATT: "The indigenous people of this series of
islands, the Swavain Islands, called the Ki'Nau,

01:16:42.226 --> 01:16:46.182
"were granted the blessing of Uk'otoa."

01:16:46.182 --> 01:16:47.339
LAURA: (whispering) Uk'otoa!

01:16:47.339 --> 01:16:59.896
MATT: "Nothing and no one could stand before them.
However, the surviving worshipers of this

01:16:59.896 --> 01:17:18.145
"once-powerful god, now banished, grew jealous, and
sealed him beneath the rocky depths of the ocean,

01:17:18.145 --> 01:17:30.826
"defaced the temples built in their name. I will
bring him back, and with their blessing, these

"seas will be mine. Let me tell you, you've put in
with the proper lot."

01:17:38.745 --> 01:17:44.642
TRAVIS: So say we all. Yeah.

01:17:44.642 --> 01:17:58.590
MATT: She puts the scarf back up to hide the
tattoo. "So I've shown you mine. You show me yours."

01:17:58.590 --> 01:18:03.266
[cheering]

01:18:03.266 --> 01:18:06.327
LIAM: Caleb is in the background, pulling cheese
from the wall.

01:18:06.327 --> 01:18:14.683
[laughter]

01:18:14.683 --> 01:18:21.222
LAURA: Are we all supposed to get naked now? I
don't--

01:18:21.222 --> 01:18:25.371
MATT: She doesn't flinch.

01:18:25.371 --> 01:18:29.058
TALIESIN: Actually, if we're going to be getting
ready for some trouble, I better change into my

01:18:29.058 --> 01:18:35.733
trouble gear, if we're going there. I'm going to
drop Disguise Self.

01:18:35.733 --> 01:18:41.553
MATT: Which puts your head pretty much right into
the top.

01:18:41.553 --> 01:18:47.077
TALIESIN: I try not to frighten people, but I
figure if we're getting messy--

01:18:47.077 --> 01:18:51.304
MATT: "I love this color palette."

01:18:51.304 --> 01:19:00.428
TALIESIN: Thank you so much. I really like this
whole room. I think you've done a really good job

01:19:00.428 --> 01:19:03.556
with it. This is great.

01:19:03.556 --> 01:19:06.208
MATT: Back to Fjord.

01:19:06.208 --> 01:19:07.705
TRAVIS: Just a moment.

01:19:07.705 --> 01:19:10.626
MARISHA: You have some secret tattoos that we
haven't seen yet?

01:19:10.626 --> 01:19:13.010
TRAVIS: No!

01:19:14.170 --> 01:19:22.228
SAM: Fjord, maybe we should come clean and form an
actual partnership with this person. If we keep

01:19:22.228 --> 01:19:25.551
lying to her, we're going to lose.

01:19:25.551 --> 01:19:30.315
TRAVIS: Nott, I'm pretty sure you're not playing
this out all the way. That shit's in my body, okay?

01:19:31.648 --> 01:19:36.093
LAURA: You guys, you realize she's standing right
here.

01:19:36.093 --> 01:19:38.920
[laughter]

01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:40.288
SAM: We're whispering.

01:19:40.334 --> 01:19:43.102
MARISHA: We're stage whispering.

01:19:43.532 --> 01:19:50.476
LAURA: I turn around and I start dancing to
distract her from what we're doing.

01:19:50.476 --> 01:19:56.324
MARISHA: Avantika.

01:19:56.324 --> 01:20:04.692
MATT: "Yes?" Make a performance check.

01:20:08.123 --> 01:20:13.970
LAURA: Oh wait, oh my god, that's good. 20.

01:20:16.136 --> 01:20:20.953
MATT: You can tell the captain's, "Yes?" but is
also peeking out of the corner of her eye at this

01:20:20.953 --> 01:20:23.152
strange display.

01:20:23.152 --> 01:20:26.881
MARISHA: Hold on, let's take advantage of this. Is
there anything else we need to talk about?

01:20:26.881 --> 01:20:34.392
LIAM: Well, clarifying question, did Avantika just
watch Fjord yell at Nott, "That shit is in my body"?

01:20:34.392 --> 01:20:36.012
MARISHA: No, no, no.

01:20:36.012 --> 01:20:37.226
LIAM: I want to know.

01:20:37.226 --> 01:20:41.167
MATT: You don't know if she's heard it, but you
guys are in a very enclosed space and she sees you

01:20:41.167 --> 01:20:47.907
all deliberating about something that you're all
deciding whether or not to reveal. She's not like,

01:20:47.907 --> 01:20:51.690
"Oh, everything's fine." She knows something's up
and she's waiting for someone to come out with it.

01:20:51.690 --> 01:20:52.992
MARISHA: Avantika.

01:20:52.992 --> 01:20:54.130
MATT: "Yes?"

01:20:54.130 --> 01:20:58.622
MARISHA: How can you be certain that you're the
only chosen one of Uk'otoa?

01:20:58.622 --> 01:20:59.459
TRAVIS: Bless you.

01:20:59.459 --> 01:21:01.328
SAM and LAURA: (whispering) Uk'otoa.

01:21:01.328 --> 01:21:03.298
TALIESIN: Uk'otoa!

01:21:03.298 --> 01:21:05.599
TRAVIS: Did you all do that together?

01:21:05.599 --> 01:21:09.102
TALIESIN: Slow but there.

01:21:09.102 --> 01:21:12.463
MATT: "Well, I'm not certain, but I'm the one who
has the dreams."

01:21:12.463 --> 01:21:14.198
TRAVIS: The dreams?

01:21:16.078 --> 01:21:17.610
MARISHA: Do you see why we did that?

01:21:17.610 --> 01:21:19.981
SAM: Okay, she said dreams. She had a dream.

01:21:19.981 --> 01:21:21.617
LAURA: You have wet dreams, you have wet dreams,
too!

01:21:21.617 --> 01:21:24.061
SAM: You do, you have dreams!

01:21:24.061 --> 01:21:25.381
TRAVIS: I have dreams.

01:21:25.381 --> 01:21:27.453
SAM: You have dreams!

01:21:29.195 --> 01:21:33.922
MATT: This big smile curls across her face, and
you watch her go a little flushed. She goes, "What

01:21:33.922 --> 01:21:35.600
"kind of dreams?"

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:38.973
MARISHA: Do you often wake up vomiting salt water?
Do you have wet dreams?

01:21:38.973 --> 01:21:52.911
[laughter and cheering]

01:21:52.911 --> 01:21:55.735
MARISHA: You don't have to be embarrassed.

01:21:55.735 --> 01:22:01.060
LIAM: You beat me to that by like 0.2346 seconds.

01:22:01.060 --> 01:22:04.506
SAM: She beat you to the wet dream?

01:22:04.506 --> 01:22:12.220
MATT: She looks a little confused, but says, "No.
Unlike some, I can hold my brine."

01:22:15.214 --> 01:22:24.226
TRAVIS: She's not looking at me, right? I'm a
(vocalizing). You have dreams? I've had dreams of

01:22:24.226 --> 01:22:31.434
being deep underwater. There's a giant eye that
sees me. I hear a voice speaking to me, but I

01:22:31.434 --> 01:22:36.404
can't reply. Does that ring any bells?

01:22:36.404 --> 01:22:40.933
MATT: Her smile grows wider. "So Uk'otoa has
spoken to you as well."

01:22:40.933 --> 01:22:47.397
[cheering]

01:22:47.397 --> 01:22:48.503
TALIESIN: What are we supposed to be doing?

01:22:48.503 --> 01:22:50.276
SAM: (whispering) Uk'otoa.

01:22:50.276 --> 01:22:56.582
MATT: "Perhaps it was not some strange coincidence
you found your way here then, Fjord?"

01:22:56.582 --> 01:23:02.593
TRAVIS: Perhaps not. Perhaps this is destiny. I
must tell you, I am very eager to see what this

01:23:02.593 --> 01:23:07.463
leads to. I haven't been entirely honest.

01:23:07.463 --> 01:23:13.032
[laughter]

01:23:13.032 --> 01:23:19.605
The item you seek does not lie on Vial Coa-- what
the fuck was it called? Vide Cay. It does not

01:23:19.605 --> 01:23:25.761
reside there. I have it protected in an alternate
dimension. I'll use Minor Image to show the

01:23:25.761 --> 01:23:29.422
sphere, and make it disappear.

01:23:29.422 --> 01:23:31.551
LAURA: Oh!

01:23:31.551 --> 01:23:35.937
MATT: All right.

01:23:35.937 --> 01:23:42.662
TRAVIS: If we can work together, I would like to
accompany you to this temple you speak of. I would

01:23:42.662 --> 01:23:48.221
like to see it find its resting place.

01:23:48.221 --> 01:23:53.521
MARISHA: Also, we're not just some dumbass crew we
hired. We totally murdered all of your guys, so.

01:23:53.521 --> 01:24:06.688
[cheering]

01:24:06.688 --> 01:24:11.370
SAM: You know what the craziest part is? We don't
really know why we did it.

01:24:11.370 --> 01:24:20.075
[cheering]

01:24:20.075 --> 01:24:22.902
SAM: We're loco.

01:24:24.507 --> 01:24:30.206
MATT: Avantika is-- it's almost a palpable passion
behind her. The excitement and adrenaline is

01:24:30.206 --> 01:24:33.891
pumping through her body, and you can see her now
leaning forward in her seat. Her feet are off the

01:24:33.891 --> 01:24:38.273
desk and her hands are grasping the sides of it in
her gloves. She's looking across, most of you, but

01:24:38.273 --> 01:24:45.964
focused on Fjord, and says, "Well, I'm very
curious to see where this leads as well. Then

01:24:45.964 --> 01:24:57.990
"perhaps let us stay the night onboard. Let's wait
for Jamedi to return, if he's plotted out the

01:24:57.990 --> 01:25:00.620
"course to this temple."

01:25:00.620 --> 01:25:02.706
TRAVIS: If who's plotted out the course to the
temple, who?

01:25:02.706 --> 01:25:05.450
MATT: "Jamedi Cosko."

01:25:05.450 --> 01:25:08.268
TRAVIS: Cosko.

01:25:10.172 --> 01:25:18.887
MATT: "If this is indeed the kismet you speak of,
what better way to prove your loyalty to me and my

01:25:18.887 --> 01:25:24.005
"ship than to be the ones to go into this temple
with me?"

01:25:24.005 --> 01:25:30.486
LIAM: Yeah, absolutely, this is an advantageous
moment for all of us. If we can help you and your

01:25:30.486 --> 01:25:32.460
hentai cult achieve your goal--

01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:42.899
[laughter]

01:25:42.899 --> 01:25:53.489
We'll all come out as winners. This is true if my
name is Philip.

01:25:55.020 --> 01:25:56.962
SAM: It is.

01:25:58.667 --> 01:26:02.459
MATT: She looks around to the rest of you, claps
her hands twice. The door opens behind and Vera

01:26:02.459 --> 01:26:09.414
enters. "Captain, you summoned?" She looks about
to the rest of you in the chamber and turns to her

01:26:09.414 --> 01:26:18.141
and goes, "Please clear out some quarters for our
guests. Tell Zoen and Waldok to sleep on the deck

01:26:18.141 --> 01:26:25.795
"tonight. Give them comfortable rooms and bedding.
Please, keep a close eye for Jamedi. Any day now,

01:26:25.795 --> 01:26:31.826
"I can feel it. We are very close."

01:26:31.826 --> 01:26:35.902
MARISHA: Jamedi, is that Cosko? Is Jumanji--?

01:26:35.902 --> 01:26:39.153
MATT: That's Cosko, yes.

01:26:39.153 --> 01:26:44.110
LIAM: Yes, Jumanji Costco, clear as day.

01:26:44.110 --> 01:26:47.278
TRAVIS: Oh no, no, no!

01:26:47.278 --> 01:26:50.530
MARISHA: He makes a note every time.

01:26:50.530 --> 01:26:53.613
LIAM: The tradition continues!

01:26:57.055 --> 01:27:06.077
MATT: Somewhere the spirit of Purvan sits next to
Vax'ildan, looking down and going, "Come on!" Vera

01:27:06.077 --> 01:27:13.012
nods and looks a bit curious. "Well then, follow
me. I'll lead you to your chambers as the captain

01:27:13.012 --> 01:27:21.352
"wishes." She looks confused and taken aback by
this sudden burst of generosity. What are you guys

01:27:21.352 --> 01:27:23.353
doing? Do you follow?

01:27:23.353 --> 01:27:25.528
SAM: Yeah. Absolutely.

01:27:25.528 --> 01:27:34.011
LAURA: I shove a bunch of the fruit in my pockets
on the way out. Is that better?

01:27:34.011 --> 01:27:34.992
MATT: There you go.

01:27:34.992 --> 01:27:39.553
TRAVIS: As we turn to leave the cabin, the
captain's quarters, a quick look of anything that

01:27:39.553 --> 01:27:43.297
looks like info about where this temple is, in
case she decides to fucking slit our throats in

01:27:43.297 --> 01:27:44.900
the middle of the night.

01:27:44.900 --> 01:27:46.481
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:27:46.481 --> 01:27:47.908
MARISHA: Come on.

01:27:47.908 --> 01:27:49.702
TRAVIS: Ugh, a ten.

01:27:49.702 --> 01:27:57.642
MATT: You don't see any indication of the temple
or anything, but you see now above the door as

01:27:57.642 --> 01:28:04.191
you're exiting, there is a small shelf. You can
see a tiny little black iron shrine that looks to

01:28:04.191 --> 01:28:13.118
be an ouroboros serpent that's eating its own
tail. About every inch or so, there's an eye

01:28:13.118 --> 01:28:20.309
across the length of its body. In the center of it
you see a single metal sphere with a similar

01:28:20.309 --> 01:28:23.039
cloven line down the center of it.

01:28:23.039 --> 01:28:24.718
TRAVIS: Awesome!

01:28:27.842 --> 01:28:36.005
LIAM: Also, if we're leaving the chamber and there
were all those people outside with the Percy sticks--

01:28:36.005 --> 01:28:40.800
MATT: Below deck, a lot of them have put the
rifles away and they have their hands on the side

01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:44.479
of their various cutlasses and longswords and
shortswords.

01:28:44.479 --> 01:28:48.861
LIAM: Yeah, if there's any out, maybe there's not,
but the thing I'm going to do leaving is to try to

01:28:48.861 --> 01:28:54.660
subtly get a good look at size, what I think they
are capable of.

01:28:54.660 --> 01:29:03.374
MATT: Roll an intelligence check. You can
definitely instantly with your feat, the DM's bane feat.

01:29:03.374 --> 01:29:05.436
LIAM: 12.

01:29:05.436 --> 01:29:11.055
MATT: You get a quick glance at it. From a
superficial level, you have a good idea of how it

01:29:11.055 --> 01:29:15.545
looks. You're not entirely certain of the
components required.

01:29:15.545 --> 01:29:18.502
LIAM: Can I see at least, is it this or this?

01:29:18.502 --> 01:29:22.412
LAURA: It depends, is it a fully-cocked rifle,
or--

01:29:24.870 --> 01:29:30.012
MATT: You see about three of them are longer
barrels. They're a two-handed piece. There are a

01:29:30.012 --> 01:29:36.598
handful that are a simple-- Laura Bailey, ladies
and gentlemen.

01:29:36.598 --> 01:29:39.037
TRAVIS: Everybody drink, yeah Laura!

01:29:39.037 --> 01:29:42.507
TALIESIN: Sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:29:42.507 --> 01:29:49.320
MATT: A few of them that have some sort of a
flintlock. One of them has a multi-barrel spinning piece.

01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:52.962
LIAM: Oh, okay.

01:29:52.962 --> 01:29:55.719
MATT: Familiar to some.

01:29:55.719 --> 01:29:58.398
TALIESIN: Strange to others.

01:30:00.740 --> 01:30:05.257
MATT: Is there anything else you guys wish to do
as you're being led to the chambers?

01:30:05.257 --> 01:30:08.157
MARISHA: Is he saying that like we're supposed to
be doing something?

01:30:08.157 --> 01:30:15.604
MATT: No. As you walk and you are led, Vera tells
two of the various deckhands to grab their shit

01:30:15.604 --> 01:30:21.525
and leave for the night. They confusedly do so and
look a bit put out by it, but you guys are led to

01:30:21.525 --> 01:30:28.944
these two chambers that are more comfortable than
at least the area you slept in The Mistake.

01:30:28.944 --> 01:30:32.736
TRAVIS: As we're moving through, can we clock sort
of what's being kept on the ship? Are there cells,

01:30:32.736 --> 01:30:36.242
are there barrels, are there packages of things?

01:30:36.242 --> 01:30:40.032
MATT: That would be down in the cargo hold, which
you've not been led to. You guys are currently on

01:30:40.032 --> 01:30:45.079
the main upper decks now. You're led to your
chambers. There are still guards posted on the

01:30:45.079 --> 01:30:51.602
outside. There isn't a complete trust in this
regard, but it's not having weapons trained on you

01:30:51.602 --> 01:30:53.741
the entirety of your stay now, at least.

01:30:53.741 --> 01:30:58.039
TRAVIS: Did we previously see what the flag they
were flying was and what it looked like? I can't remember.

01:30:58.039 --> 01:31:02.145
MATT: You didn't pay a very close attention to it,
but you can go and check if you'd like.

01:31:02.145 --> 01:31:03.872
TRAVIS: Can we do that now?

01:31:03.872 --> 01:31:09.903
MATT: Sure. You head up to it and the flag
actually is an exact, or is close to a replica of

01:31:09.903 --> 01:31:11.712
the tattoo that she has on her sternum.

01:31:11.712 --> 01:31:13.199
LAURA: Whoa.

01:31:13.199 --> 01:31:14.499
TALIESIN: (impressed whistling)

01:31:14.499 --> 01:31:16.562
TRAVIS: That fucking eye.

01:31:16.562 --> 01:31:22.017
SAM: The guards posted at our door, do they have
guns or just like knives and stuff?

01:31:22.017 --> 01:31:23.121
MATT: Both.

01:31:23.121 --> 01:31:24.581
SAM: Oh, both!

01:31:24.581 --> 01:31:30.959
MATT: They have blades sheathed for close combat.
You know, when you're below deck, generally you

01:31:30.959 --> 01:31:35.942
want shorter blades and things that are good for
close quarters. The firearms are more for if they

01:31:35.942 --> 01:31:37.479
have to do something at a distance.

01:31:37.479 --> 01:31:38.329
SAM: Okay.

01:31:38.329 --> 01:31:41.081
LIAM: So most everyone here is packing, then.

01:31:41.081 --> 01:31:46.352
MATT: You've seen at least seven or eight of the
crew with some form of firearm. Their make, from a

01:31:46.352 --> 01:31:51.217
quick glance, you saw a lot of their make and
construction varies. They seem to have been

01:31:51.217 --> 01:31:54.254
plucked from different sources.

01:31:54.254 --> 01:31:56.052
LAURA: Captain Tusktooth?

01:31:56.052 --> 01:31:57.334
TRAVIS: Yes?

01:31:57.334 --> 01:32:01.058
LAURA: Doesn't your weapon have an eyeball on it?

01:32:01.058 --> 01:32:02.443
TRAVIS: It does.

01:32:02.443 --> 01:32:05.222
LAURA: That's cool.

01:32:05.222 --> 01:32:08.225
TRAVIS: But I don't want her to know that.

01:32:08.225 --> 01:32:13.478
LAURA: Oh, but-- Oh! because she would also
swallow, so she would know that her

01:32:13.478 --> 01:32:15.850
weapon would have it.

01:32:15.850 --> 01:32:22.960
[laughter]

01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:26.962
TRAVIS: I can't know that for sure, but I know
that as soon as she has it, there's very little

01:32:26.962 --> 01:32:29.053
reason to keep us around.

01:32:29.053 --> 01:32:29.897
LAURA: Right.

01:32:29.897 --> 01:32:31.042
TRAVIS: Caduceus?

01:32:31.042 --> 01:32:32.001
TALIESIN: Yeah?

01:32:32.001 --> 01:32:38.256
TRAVIS: Would you mind telling me, did you feel
anything coming from the captain?

01:32:38.256 --> 01:32:42.054
TALIESIN: Like what? I don't really--

01:32:42.054 --> 01:32:48.662
TRAVIS: Well, I don't know. You seem to make these
strange comments about how people feel and stuff.

01:32:48.662 --> 01:32:51.537
I'd have thought maybe you were like a
mind-reader.

01:32:51.537 --> 01:32:56.887
TALIESIN: I was really just listening for that
word because I wanted to play the speak along

01:32:56.887 --> 01:33:02.500
game. I wasn't really paying that much attention,
I'm so sorry. I got a little distracted in there.

01:33:02.500 --> 01:33:04.295
That was really fun, though.

01:33:04.295 --> 01:33:05.330
LAURA: Yeah, it was a fun game.

01:33:05.330 --> 01:33:06.991
SAM: Yeah, it was.

01:33:06.991 --> 01:33:12.777
TRAVIS: Let's pay attention next time, shall we?
Cool.

01:33:12.777 --> 01:33:23.073
SAM: Fjord, if I may. I'm sorry, Captain
Tusktooth, if I may, when we find this Uk'otoa--

01:33:23.073 --> 01:33:26.432
LAURA and TALIESIN: (whispering) Uk'otoa.

01:33:26.432 --> 01:33:36.117
SAM: You have this thing inside of you, is your
goal to get rid of the thing inside of you, to

01:33:36.117 --> 01:33:42.663
commune with it, to bow down and serve this
monster?

01:33:42.663 --> 01:33:46.924
LAURA: Or are you going to become like a god or
something?

01:33:46.924 --> 01:33:56.045
LIAM: I feel like we are learning a lot about you
right now, and not from you. Are we alone?

01:33:56.045 --> 01:34:03.274
[laughter]

01:34:03.274 --> 01:34:04.771
MATT: It's funny you ask that question.

01:34:04.771 --> 01:34:05.996
SAM: I thought we were in our chamber.

01:34:05.996 --> 01:34:10.514
MATT: No, you're in your chamber. You're alone,
but you don't know how thick these walls are. You

01:34:10.514 --> 01:34:12.955
know there are people stationed right outside of
your door.

01:34:12.955 --> 01:34:16.442
LAURA: Can I look around and see if there's any
peepholes in the walls or anything?

01:34:16.442 --> 01:34:19.272
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:34:19.272 --> 01:34:20.739
TRAVIS: Oh, good call.

01:34:20.739 --> 01:34:26.859
LAURA: 12.

01:34:26.859 --> 01:34:30.041
MATT: You take a moment to glance around the space
and feel along the walls. You don't notice

01:34:30.041 --> 01:34:31.811
anything that catches your attention.

01:34:31.811 --> 01:34:32.897
LAURA: Okay.

01:34:32.897 --> 01:34:40.166
LIAM: I pull out the wire in view of everyone, and
cover my hands and say to Fjord: Is there anything

01:34:40.166 --> 01:34:45.037
that you maybe want to tell us about that you
haven't already?

01:34:45.037 --> 01:34:48.384
TRAVIS: I mean--

01:34:48.384 --> 01:34:55.971
SAM: Wait! Before you talk out loud, can't you use
your magic to make some sound or something to

01:34:55.971 --> 01:34:59.821
muffle what's happening in here?

01:34:59.821 --> 01:35:01.616
LAURA: Um, no.

01:35:01.616 --> 01:35:03.709
SAM: Okay, good. Go on.

01:35:03.709 --> 01:35:10.223
LAURA: Wait, wait! Caleb, what if you use your
anti-sink bubble?

01:35:10.223 --> 01:35:16.619
LIAM: Well, I would have to ask the DM. I don't
know about this. That bubble, I don't know if it

01:35:16.619 --> 01:35:20.863
is soundproof at all because I just got that
spell.

01:35:20.863 --> 01:35:22.852
MATT: Let me check. I do not believe it is.

01:35:22.852 --> 01:35:24.499
LIAM: I don't think it is.

01:35:24.499 --> 01:35:27.454
MATT: But I will check real fast while I'm here.

01:35:27.454 --> 01:35:30.536
LAURA: I can use Thaumaturgy to make it sound like
there's ominous whispers all around.

01:35:30.536 --> 01:35:32.730
SAM: Yeah, that would, that's good.

01:35:32.730 --> 01:35:34.987
TALIESIN: Actually, if we both do that, maybe it's
like going to be white noise.

01:35:34.987 --> 01:35:36.441
SAM: Yeah, it'll be like a white noise machine.

01:35:36.441 --> 01:35:37.824
LAURA: Can we create white noise?

01:35:37.824 --> 01:35:38.919
MARISHA: Yeah, white noise.

01:35:38.919 --> 01:35:40.354
SAM: Yasha can fall asleep.

01:35:40.354 --> 01:35:44.132
MATT: It prevents creatures from entering and
exiting, outside of the ones that you choose, but

01:35:44.132 --> 01:35:48.861
it does not shift, alter, or stop any sound
passage.

01:35:48.861 --> 01:35:49.748
LIAM: Yeah, I would--

01:35:49.748 --> 01:35:52.914
MARISHA: That means everyone heard Beau and Keg
bone, is what you're saying.

01:35:52.914 --> 01:35:59.161
[cheering]

01:35:59.161 --> 01:36:00.353
TRAVIS: Well, if--

01:36:00.353 --> 01:36:05.432
LIAM: Well, you were upstairs, so only if you're
screamers.

01:36:05.432 --> 01:36:11.507
LAURA: Well, some of us actually saw it.

01:36:11.507 --> 01:36:13.497
MARISHA: It's a good night.

01:36:13.497 --> 01:36:14.344
TRAVIS: No shame.

01:36:14.344 --> 01:36:15.508
MARISHA: No shame. No regrets.

01:36:15.508 --> 01:36:20.430
LAURA: Can Caduceus and I use our Thaumaturgy to
make ominous whispers all around us so that it's

01:36:20.430 --> 01:36:22.984
like white noise so that we can whisper inside?

01:36:22.984 --> 01:36:24.745
MATT: Sure.

01:36:24.745 --> 01:36:28.731
LAURA: Yeah, that's what we do. Constantly. We'll
trade off so it's like--

01:36:28.731 --> 01:36:35.168
TALIESIN and LAURA: (whispering) Krakatoa.
Krakatoa.

01:36:35.168 --> 01:36:37.743
TALIESIN: All my whispers are just saying that in
different pitches.

01:36:37.743 --> 01:36:40.581
MATT: Right, okay. I'll allow it.

01:36:40.581 --> 01:36:44.210
LAURA: All of mine are just playing the penis
game.

01:36:47.835 --> 01:36:52.776
TRAVIS: I'll tell you what I know, and that's that
I see visions, sometimes, it's been a long time

01:36:52.776 --> 01:36:58.452
since. There's a giant eye, and I hear a voice
speaking to me. I don't know where it comes from,

01:36:58.452 --> 01:37:05.836
and I don't know where I am, if it's the past or
my future. But I feel like it happened that night

01:37:05.836 --> 01:37:11.218
when the ship exploded, and before I found myself
on the shore with the sword. I feel like those

01:37:11.218 --> 01:37:17.180
things are all connected. When I saw the sphere,
it reminded me of that eye.

01:37:17.180 --> 01:37:21.948
LIAM: You have, I'm speaking very quietly amongst
Jester's whispers.

01:37:21.948 --> 01:37:23.086
TRAVIS: I am, too.

01:37:23.086 --> 01:37:24.202
LAURA: (whispering) Penis, penis, penis.

01:37:24.202 --> 01:37:25.217
LIAM: You have been having--

01:37:25.217 --> 01:37:26.043
LAURA: Penis!

01:37:26.043 --> 01:37:27.072
TALIESIN: Krakotoa, Krakotoa, Krakotoa.

01:37:27.072 --> 01:37:30.471
LIAM: This is an ongoing dream that you have been
having?

01:37:30.471 --> 01:37:33.577
TRAVIS: I wouldn't say ongoing. It's happened like
three or four times.

01:37:33.577 --> 01:37:35.728
MATT: Yeah, sure.

01:37:35.728 --> 01:37:38.934
TRAVIS: Sure, three or four times. Three.

01:37:38.934 --> 01:37:43.481
LIAM: Three or four times, you have had a dream
with a thing that has a giant eye like the one on

01:37:43.481 --> 01:37:48.154
your sword, and like the inner motifs of this
woman's office?

01:37:48.154 --> 01:37:51.886
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:37:51.886 --> 01:37:56.176
MARISHA: You know, there were several eyes in that
ouroboros.

01:37:56.176 --> 01:37:56.809
TRAVIS: Right.

01:37:56.809 --> 01:38:00.112
MARISHA: I wonder if that's how many other chosen
ones there are.

01:38:00.112 --> 01:38:05.453
LAURA: Oh my god, what if there's that many other
eyeballs? You can like, swallow them all, and then

01:38:05.453 --> 01:38:09.110
you become like ultra powerful.

01:38:09.110 --> 01:38:10.923
TRAVIS: Or I can summon the dragon.

01:38:10.923 --> 01:38:20.315
[cheering]

01:38:20.315 --> 01:38:24.381
LAURA: I think you get a wish!

01:38:24.381 --> 01:38:28.554
TRAVIS: I have been having them, but I wouldn't
think to comment on them because they're just

01:38:28.554 --> 01:38:31.045
fucking dreams.

01:38:31.045 --> 01:38:38.164
LIAM: Yeah, okay. Were you able to summon a scary
transparent tentacles before that explosion on the

01:38:38.164 --> 01:38:40.489
boat and those dreams happened?

01:38:40.489 --> 01:38:41.408
TRAVIS: No.

01:38:41.408 --> 01:38:43.329
MARISHA: Yeah, that shit ain't dreams, man.

01:38:43.329 --> 01:38:47.801
LIAM: Were you vomiting seawater before you had
those dreams? Or making a sword come out of the

01:38:47.801 --> 01:38:51.878
palm of your hand before that explosion?

01:38:51.878 --> 01:38:56.513
TRAVIS: Not to my knowledge.

01:38:56.513 --> 01:39:10.292
LIAM: No judgements here, but is it safe to say
that you have been under-sharing with us?

01:39:10.292 --> 01:39:13.491
MARISHA: I don't know, he's told us all that
before.

01:39:13.491 --> 01:39:16.055
LIAM: Every single thing?

01:39:16.055 --> 01:39:20.562
MARISHA: Yeah, I think so.

01:39:20.562 --> 01:39:28.536
TRAVIS: Did I? No, you're right, I have
under-shared, and I'm sorry. I just didn't think

01:39:28.536 --> 01:39:34.735
it was relevant.

01:39:34.735 --> 01:39:38.514
LIAM: Seems pretty relevant.

01:39:38.514 --> 01:39:42.354
TRAVIS: Well yeah, fucking now.

01:39:42.354 --> 01:39:46.436
MARISHA: Well look, I mean, Jester gets visited by
the Traveler.

01:39:46.436 --> 01:39:47.518
LAURA: I do.

01:39:47.518 --> 01:39:49.834
MARISHA: Yasha, has thunder--

01:39:49.834 --> 01:39:52.301
ASHLEY: Dreams and visions. I do.

01:39:52.301 --> 01:39:56.964
MARISHA: She has dreams and visions, maybe you
guys are just special or whatever the fuck they

01:39:56.964 --> 01:39:58.647
tell people.

01:39:58.647 --> 01:40:04.299
[laughter]

01:40:04.299 --> 01:40:10.535
TRAVIS: Yeah, Yasha, I mean, do you vomit after
you talk to the thunder?

01:40:10.535 --> 01:40:18.327
ASHLEY: I only vomit if something upsets my
stomach. So I don't wake up from dreams or visions

01:40:18.327 --> 01:40:20.606
vomiting anything.

01:40:20.606 --> 01:40:22.700
TRAVIS: Me, neither, it happened one time, so.

01:40:22.700 --> 01:40:23.712
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:40:23.712 --> 01:40:24.688
TRAVIS: Just the once.

01:40:24.688 --> 01:40:26.148
MARISHA: Right.

01:40:26.148 --> 01:40:32.982
TRAVIS: Look, I feel like if we can get on land,
at least, and some sort of landing party, we'll

01:40:32.982 --> 01:40:40.456
have a better shot. Nott, you're terrified of the
water. I mean, we're on unfriendly ground. I don't

01:40:40.456 --> 01:40:45.258
mind trying to slip away or forcing our way out of
this situation, but I sure would like a resolution

01:40:45.258 --> 01:40:52.659
and at least a better place to stage some sort of
action than on an enemy boat.

01:40:52.659 --> 01:40:53.559
SAM: What the--?

01:40:53.559 --> 01:40:57.137
TRAVIS: Ship. Ship, it's a ship.

01:40:57.597 --> 01:41:00.005
TALIESIN: How many, how many, how many?

01:41:00.005 --> 01:41:01.922
TRAVIS and TALISIN: Three masts.

01:41:01.922 --> 01:41:03.848
TRAVIS: Mizzenmast, mainmast, foremast, I got it,
ha ha ha!

01:41:03.848 --> 01:41:10.720
[cheering]

01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:15.912
SAM: But our goal right now is not to run away,
right?

01:41:15.912 --> 01:41:19.902
LIAM: Yes, this was my next question. I,
personally, was thinking about getting the hell

01:41:19.902 --> 01:41:22.761
out of here, but.

01:41:22.761 --> 01:41:24.325
SAM: We're here for Fjord.

01:41:24.325 --> 01:41:29.253
LIAM: We are here for you, and you want to
understand what is happening to you.

01:41:29.253 --> 01:41:34.444
TRAVIS: No, I just want to know where the temple
is. I don't care if these people die.

01:41:34.444 --> 01:41:38.105
SAM: No, but thing inside of you--

01:41:38.105 --> 01:41:43.660
TRAVIS: No, yeah, no that's what I meant. I know
you want to leave, I do as well, but we need to

01:41:43.660 --> 01:41:45.920
play this game a little longer, yeah?

01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:52.053
LIAM: Yeah, I think we are, you know, we're
friends. I think we're trying to figure out where we--

01:41:52.053 --> 01:41:59.938
SAM: Caleb! We're friends, don't say it like that.
Don't say we're friends, like a question. It's

01:41:59.938 --> 01:42:03.921
downward, we're friends.

01:42:03.921 --> 01:42:07.946
LIAM: We are friends.

01:42:07.946 --> 01:42:09.150
SAM: No.

01:42:09.150 --> 01:42:11.272
TRAVIS: That's back up.

01:42:11.272 --> 01:42:14.302
SAM: That was a question, it's a down.

01:42:14.302 --> 01:42:25.013
LIAM: But-- Addendum: now we are friends with a giant
squid being with a giant eye, so I'm just trying to--

01:42:25.069 --> 01:42:27.195
TRAVIS: Where'd the squid come from?

01:42:27.195 --> 01:42:30.086
LIAM: Ouroboros, giant eyes, lots of tentacles.

01:42:30.086 --> 01:42:34.295
TRAVIS: I heard serpent and leviathan. Is
leviathan a giant squid?

01:42:34.295 --> 01:42:36.097
MARISHA: Well, no it's like a serpent.

01:42:36.097 --> 01:42:39.672
LIAM: I mean we've all read stories of sea
creatures. I'm just vibing here, go with me.

01:42:39.672 --> 01:42:42.563
The point is--

01:42:42.563 --> 01:42:48.345
SAM: The point is we're here to support you in
finding out what's going on inside.

01:42:48.345 --> 01:42:49.788
LAURA: In your heart.

01:42:49.788 --> 01:42:53.836
SAM: What's going on in your past, and if that
means we have to go fight some shit, we're with

01:42:53.836 --> 01:43:00.331
you, and if it means you say, "Let's run," we'll
run, but we got your back, big guy.

01:43:00.331 --> 01:43:01.932
LIAM: That is the point.

01:43:01.932 --> 01:43:08.229
[cheering]

01:43:08.229 --> 01:43:09.535
MARISHA: I mean, look.

01:43:09.535 --> 01:43:11.717
SAM: As long as I don't have to swim.

01:43:13.579 --> 01:43:19.915
MARISHA: Avantika seems like she's had this gift
and these visions for quite some time. Maybe you

01:43:19.915 --> 01:43:24.670
could learn something about yourself. Talk to her
a little bit.

01:43:24.670 --> 01:43:29.653
LAURA: (gasping) Does that mean she swallowed one,
too? I mean, like really though, does she have one

01:43:29.653 --> 01:43:31.023
inside of her?

01:43:31.023 --> 01:43:31.905
SAM: She might.

01:43:31.905 --> 01:43:36.427
LAURA: (gasping) If there's multiple ones. What if
she has more than one, and she's more powerful

01:43:36.427 --> 01:43:40.697
than you? (gasping)

01:43:41.852 --> 01:43:50.204
SAM: How, how do we get to look at her belly?
Should we go swimming, hope she wears a bikini and

01:43:50.204 --> 01:43:52.138
check for scars?

01:43:52.138 --> 01:43:59.235
LAURA: What if I, what if I'm walking along and I
fall, and I accidentally go like, on her stomach?

01:43:59.235 --> 01:44:00.849
SAM: That's not bad.

01:44:00.849 --> 01:44:02.768
TRAVIS: I don't know if you can feel--

01:44:02.841 --> 01:44:07.395
LAURA: Lift your armor up, Fjord. I've been trying
to find out for a long time if I can actually feel a lump.

01:44:07.395 --> 01:44:09.913
SAM: Lift it up!

01:44:12.934 --> 01:44:15.127
LAURA: This is important, I need to know.

01:44:15.127 --> 01:44:17.468
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm not comfortable doing that.

01:44:17.468 --> 01:44:23.040
LIAM: I think we are past the point of secrets
here.

01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:24.492
LAURA: Yeah.

01:44:24.492 --> 01:44:26.349
LIAM: We need to know what is what.

01:44:26.349 --> 01:44:28.668
LAURA: Exactly, I need to feel your abs.

01:44:28.668 --> 01:44:41.881
[cheering]

01:44:41.881 --> 01:44:44.968
MATT: Make a medicine check.

01:44:45.650 --> 01:44:48.784
LIAM: Not straight charisma?

01:44:50.931 --> 01:44:57.302
LAURA: Oh, I'm proficient! 18.

01:44:57.302 --> 01:45:06.549
MATT: Having a fair understanding of the half-orc
body, while Fjord is generally a little more lithe

01:45:06.549 --> 01:45:15.200
and trimmer than most more burly half orcs, still
a decent build, but you don't feel any particular

01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:17.887
strange lumps.

01:45:17.887 --> 01:45:20.997
SAM: Maybe lower, go lower.

01:45:20.997 --> 01:45:26.160
[cheering]

01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:29.218
SAM: You know, the V.

01:45:31.072 --> 01:45:35.333
TRAVIS: If you could be succinct, I'm a little
fucking ticklish, okay?

01:45:37.169 --> 01:45:38.925
MATT: You don't feel anything, unfortunately.

01:45:38.925 --> 01:45:40.213
LAURA: I don't feel any lumps.

01:45:40.213 --> 01:45:42.691
TRAVIS: (singing)

01:45:43.415 --> 01:45:46.761
LIAM: The hunt for Fjord's third ball continues.

01:45:46.761 --> 01:45:53.482
[laughter]

01:45:53.482 --> 01:45:57.603
TALIESIN: It's technically fourth ball at this
point, I think, isn't it actually? Sorry, that's

01:45:57.603 --> 01:45:59.565
the face I wanted.

01:45:59.565 --> 01:46:06.474
[laughter]

01:46:06.474 --> 01:46:11.472
TRAVIS: Are we okay to play this out, see how it
goes, at least get on land and see if we can find

01:46:11.472 --> 01:46:14.745
this temple this crazy bitch talks about?

01:46:14.745 --> 01:46:16.160
MARISHA: Hell yeah, man.

01:46:16.160 --> 01:46:19.980
LAURA and SAM: Yeah, let's do it.

01:46:19.980 --> 01:46:23.970
MARISHA: Yasha, you look trepidatious.

01:46:23.970 --> 01:46:26.298
ASHLEY: I feel like we should ask her more
questions.

01:46:26.298 --> 01:46:27.639
TRAVIS: Of her?

01:46:27.639 --> 01:46:32.997
ASHLEY: Yeah, like maybe she knows if there are
more spheres and how to find them, if they're in

01:46:32.997 --> 01:46:34.548
the temple.

01:46:34.548 --> 01:46:35.679
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think that's--

01:46:35.679 --> 01:46:38.454
SAM: Well she's coming with us, right? We can ask
her on the way.

01:46:38.454 --> 01:46:39.556
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:46:39.556 --> 01:46:46.974
SAM: Maybe, Yasha, you can intimidate her with
your girth and darkness.

01:46:46.974 --> 01:46:48.670
TALIESIN: No, that's--

01:46:48.670 --> 01:46:50.758
LAURA: And piercing eyes.

01:46:50.758 --> 01:46:54.672
TALIESIN: This is not an intimidatable person. I
mean, you can just look--

01:46:54.672 --> 01:46:56.001
MARISHA: I disagree.

01:46:56.001 --> 01:47:04.843
TALIESIN: I think, from what little I gleaned, I
imagine vanity is the way to play this one.

01:47:04.843 --> 01:47:06.248
TRAVIS: Vanity, you say?

01:47:06.248 --> 01:47:14.998
TALIESIN: Yeah. I mean, some people just want to
talk, and I think she just wants somebody to talk

01:47:14.998 --> 01:47:16.798
to. That's the vibe I get.

01:47:17.294 --> 01:47:22.034
[cheering]

01:47:22.034 --> 01:47:24.002
MARISHA: Yeah, we did say we were going to get
better at that.

01:47:24.002 --> 01:47:26.493
SAM: Or, we can murder everyone on the boat!

01:47:26.493 --> 01:47:29.600
[laughter]

01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:32.867
SAM: Ah!

01:47:33.711 --> 01:47:35.791
TRAVIS: We're trying to do less of that.

01:47:35.791 --> 01:47:36.622
SAM: Okay.

01:47:36.622 --> 01:47:39.005
LIAM: Yeah, this is too simplistic, it could be
both.

01:47:39.005 --> 01:47:40.452
SAM: Okay.

01:47:40.452 --> 01:47:41.708
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:47:41.708 --> 01:47:44.413
LIAM: For now, we are allies.

01:47:44.413 --> 01:47:46.060
SAM: All right.

01:47:46.060 --> 01:47:50.470
LIAM: For now, we work together to figure out his
problem.

01:47:50.470 --> 01:47:51.748
SAM: Mm-hmm.

01:47:51.748 --> 01:47:56.787
LIAM: If we have to eventually (throat croaking).

01:47:56.809 --> 01:47:57.926
TRAVS: Me?

01:47:57.926 --> 01:47:59.116
SAM: No, not you!

01:47:59.116 --> 01:48:00.717
TRAVIS: Oh.

01:48:00.717 --> 01:48:07.888
SAM: I mean yes, if you turn evil and bond with
Rikatoa.

01:48:07.888 --> 01:48:09.558
LAURA: (whispering) Krakatoa.

01:48:09.558 --> 01:48:11.717
MARISHA: Chick ah, chick ah.

01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:17.460
SAM: Is it night time now? Are we going to sleep?

01:48:17.460 --> 01:48:22.229
MATT: It's like late afternoon. It isn't quite
dusk yet, but whenever you want to. Essentially,

01:48:22.229 --> 01:48:25.450
you're ready and prepared for an evening's rest,
we'll go do that.

01:48:25.450 --> 01:48:27.020
SAM: Okay.

01:48:27.020 --> 01:48:28.726
TRAVIS: Do it.

01:48:28.726 --> 01:48:37.218
MATT: You go ahead and find yourselves settling in
best you can for the evening's rest. As--

01:48:37.218 --> 01:48:39.519
SAM: I'm going to sneak down into the cargo hold.

01:48:39.519 --> 01:48:45.309
[laughter]

01:48:45.309 --> 01:48:47.940
MATT: Make a stealth check.

01:48:47.940 --> 01:48:52.828
SAM: With my cloak on, so that's an advantage-y
thing?

01:48:52.828 --> 01:48:53.804
LAURA: Yeah.

01:48:53.804 --> 01:48:54.979
MATT: With your cloak, yes.

01:48:54.979 --> 01:48:59.039
SAM: Okay, stealth. 26.

01:48:59.039 --> 01:49:04.819
[cheering]

01:49:04.819 --> 01:49:07.748
MATT: I'm not even going to roll.

01:49:08.746 --> 01:49:12.899
LIAM: Is that a stealth on all of us, too? You
snuck out on us?

01:49:12.899 --> 01:49:18.311
SAM: I probably told you that I would be right
back. I had to go to the little girls' room.

01:49:18.311 --> 01:49:22.489
MATT: All right, for one thing, as soon as you,
because there's only one exit to the chamber.

01:49:22.489 --> 01:49:23.266
SAM: Huh?

01:49:23.266 --> 01:49:26.926
MATT: There's only one exit to the chamber. The
door that leads out, as soon as you (door

01:49:26.926 --> 01:49:31.580
creaking) you see the guard is posted right there.
You feel pretty quiet, and you're pretty, you feel

01:49:31.580 --> 01:49:35.436
that you're in the groove where you can get
through pretty quickly without being seen, but you

01:49:35.436 --> 01:49:39.119
have to get past that one guard that you can see
stationed right outside of the door.

01:49:39.119 --> 01:49:53.343
SAM: Okay, I'll use a spell, then. I'll take a
little bit of-- I think it's a cloth, fleece-- as

01:49:53.343 --> 01:50:02.511
Caleb taught me, and I'll create a Silent Image
down the hall. Can I peek out the door a little bit?

01:50:02.511 --> 01:50:06.024
MATT: I'll say because of your stealth check, yes.
You very carefully nudge the door open enough to

01:50:06.024 --> 01:50:11.185
get like an inch of viewing space between. That
both reveals the guard and the hallway further down.

01:50:11.185 --> 01:50:23.583
SAM: I'll make it look like Cosko is walking by
the hall. Then walks back.

01:50:23.583 --> 01:50:25.031
MATT: Okay.

01:50:25.031 --> 01:50:27.296
SAM: Back again.

01:50:27.296 --> 01:50:29.505
LIAM: Is it a guy in like a Costco T-shirt?

01:50:29.505 --> 01:50:30.667
SAM: Yeah.

01:50:30.667 --> 01:50:34.160
TRAVIS: Amazing.

01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:38.152
MATT: Keeping a tally.

01:50:38.152 --> 01:50:39.608
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

01:50:39.608 --> 01:50:45.512
SAM: Well, we're in New York, I don't know if they
have Costco. Sam's Club.

01:50:45.512 --> 01:50:48.086
MARISHA: That's good.

01:50:51.605 --> 01:51:00.699
MATT: You create the image of him walking back and
forth. The guard notices. (spluttering) Pats

01:51:00.699 --> 01:51:08.067
another guard that you don't see on the upper side
of the door. Guard's like, "Is Cosko back? Go get

01:51:08.067 --> 01:51:14.628
"the captain." The other guy goes and walks away,
and the other guy stands there nervously looking

01:51:14.684 --> 01:51:21.683
back and forth. "Jamedi?"

01:51:22.141 --> 01:51:27.889
SAM: I'll have Cosko moonwalk across the hall.

01:51:27.889 --> 01:51:34.173
MATT: "Jamedi? Jamedi!" He goes and starts walking
in that direction.

01:51:34.173 --> 01:51:38.175
SAM: Okay, I'll make my run away, my getaway.
(trilling)

01:51:38.175 --> 01:51:40.995
MATT: Okay, you get by, you get outside of the
door. Are you running to the right or the left?

01:51:40.995 --> 01:51:42.361
SAM: Left.

01:51:42.361 --> 01:51:46.099
MATT: You run to the left. You go running down the
hallway, and you're now not that far behind the

01:51:46.099 --> 01:51:49.280
other guard, who was rushing off and heading up a
small set of stairs that leads up to the captain's

01:51:49.280 --> 01:51:52.710
quarters. You remember this before. You're
actually heading away from the cargo hold this way

01:51:52.710 --> 01:51:54.294
now. You're heading up.

01:51:54.294 --> 01:51:57.667
SAM: Oh. I don't want to do that.

01:51:57.667 --> 01:51:58.781
MATT: Yeah.

01:51:58.781 --> 01:52:00.237
SAM: I'll turn around and go the other way.

01:52:00.237 --> 01:52:05.908
MATT: Okay, you go the other direction, and the
guy who's now walked up towards Cosko, towards

01:52:05.908 --> 01:52:11.277
Jamedi, is now rushing up to it and goes and is
talking to him like, "Sir, hello?"

01:52:11.277 --> 01:52:14.508
SAM: I'll have Cosko, is there a stairs or a
ladder near here?

01:52:14.508 --> 01:52:15.877
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:52:15.877 --> 01:52:20.570
SAM: Okay, oh, that's a four.

01:52:20.570 --> 01:52:26.309
MATT: You're not sure, you see a couple of chairs,
a card table that's currently empty. You can see

01:52:26.309 --> 01:52:29.103
the hallway continues past where this illusion is
happening.

01:52:29.103 --> 01:52:33.132
SAM: Card table that's currently empty? Cosko's
going to sit down at that card table and start

01:52:33.132 --> 01:52:34.898
dealing two hands.

01:52:34.898 --> 01:52:39.194
[laughter]

01:52:39.194 --> 01:52:41.277
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

01:52:43.600 --> 01:52:52.347
MATT: As he does so, the guy's like, "Jamedi, the
captain will be right here-- What?" Just looks

01:52:52.347 --> 01:52:54.385
really confused.

01:52:54.385 --> 01:52:56.459
SAM: Is there a way to slip by?

01:52:56.459 --> 01:52:58.916
MATT: Your stealth check, yes there is. You dart
past.

01:52:58.916 --> 01:53:00.298
SAM: Slip by the back, yeah.

01:53:00.298 --> 01:53:02.286
MATT: Right at that moment you look over your
shoulder, and you can see the captain is now

01:53:02.286 --> 01:53:04.829
heading down the hallway in your direction.

01:53:04.829 --> 01:53:07.231
SAM: Okay, I'll make the effect disappear.

01:53:07.231 --> 01:53:08.888
MATT: He goes, "What? I don't?"

01:53:08.888 --> 01:53:13.602
SAM: Oh, but I'll leave the effect of the cards
still there.

01:53:13.602 --> 01:53:22.629
[cheering]

01:53:22.629 --> 01:53:26.270
MATT: You run to the end of the hallway. You see
those stairs ascending down into the cargo hold

01:53:26.270 --> 01:53:34.460
below, and you hear over your shoulder, "And where
is he?" "No, but Captain, he was right-- Look at

01:53:34.460 --> 01:53:37.330
"the cards."

01:53:37.330 --> 01:53:39.798
SAM: Poof!

01:53:42.349 --> 01:53:47.571
MATT: You hear the argument, and the guy
desperately trying to explain what he just saw, as

01:53:47.571 --> 01:53:50.394
you disappear down into the cargo hold below.

01:53:50.394 --> 01:53:59.827
SAM: I'm going to look around for boxes and
interesting stuff. Bullets, black powder, any books.

01:53:59.827 --> 01:54:06.234
LIAM: Also, in your ear, very quiet, you hear: Oh
hey, is everything okay? Going well?

01:54:06.234 --> 01:54:17.961
SAM: Ah yeah, just going number two! It's going to
be a while. That hardtack is hard coming out, too.

01:54:17.961 --> 01:54:22.221
MATT: On the way down the stairs, there is another
floor that is the gun deck, that you do pass by

01:54:22.221 --> 01:54:25.976
and you can see the back end of these large
cannons that are all situated. They're all angled

01:54:25.976 --> 01:54:30.374
up a little bit, but there are these doors that
lead outward. There are a number of cannon balls,

01:54:30.374 --> 01:54:37.924
and some bits of black powder in small barrels,
set up in that region. If you can continue down to the--

01:54:37.924 --> 01:54:40.705
SAM: Sure, keep going. Looking for interesting
stuff.

01:54:40.705 --> 01:54:45.568
MATT: You head down to the cargo hold, and you see
one source of lantern light. There is one of the

01:54:45.568 --> 01:54:52.432
various deckhands is down below, keeping watch.
Has a single oil lantern on a crate. It is this

01:54:52.432 --> 01:54:59.649
small, handheld jug of some sort of, you assume, a
liquor, and he's sipping from it. Leaning back and

01:54:59.649 --> 01:55:02.798
stretching. Just keeping an eye out.

01:55:02.798 --> 01:55:07.778
SAM: I will use Mage Hand, and he's just got the
one lantern down there?

01:55:07.778 --> 01:55:09.317
MATT: Currently, yeah.

01:55:09.317 --> 01:55:13.965
SAM: I will use Mage Hand to try to snuff out the
flame.

01:55:13.965 --> 01:55:18.918
MATT: Easy enough to do. (whoosh) Goes dark.
"What?!"

01:55:18.918 --> 01:55:23.140
SAM: I'll keep going, using darkvision to look
around and see things.

01:55:23.140 --> 01:55:27.717
MATT: Okay, so you start making your way around.
As you do, you start seeing sparks. Of a flint.

01:55:27.717 --> 01:55:29.265
SAM: Oh, he's trying to light it again.

01:55:29.265 --> 01:55:33.634
MATT: He's trying to relight the lantern. He's
like, "Ooh, fucking shit, stupid little lantern."

01:55:33.634 --> 01:55:37.810
Make an investigation check if you wanted to look
into the cargo hold.

01:55:37.810 --> 01:55:42.078
SAM: All right, investigation, 22.

01:55:42.078 --> 01:55:43.970
LAURA: Ooh!

01:55:46.859 --> 01:55:51.529
MATT: How thorough do you want this search to be?
Because it'll take you a while to go through the

01:55:51.529 --> 01:55:53.542
entire cargo hold.

01:55:53.542 --> 01:55:59.224
SAM: Looking for interesting boxes. I don't want
to spend more than five minutes down here, if possible.

01:55:59.224 --> 01:56:02.641
MATT: Okay, you'll probably have to snuff the
lantern one more time, and really frustrate the

01:56:02.641 --> 01:56:04.076
hell out of him.

01:56:04.076 --> 01:56:06.075
SAM: Sure. Maybe I can, can I grab it out of his
hand?

01:56:06.075 --> 01:56:07.170
MATT: The flint?

01:56:07.170 --> 01:56:08.696
SAM: Or the lantern?

01:56:08.696 --> 01:56:09.501
MATT: Yeah.

01:56:09.501 --> 01:56:11.207
SAM: Make him drop it?

01:56:11.207 --> 01:56:15.473
MATT: Okay, all right. He lights the lantern,
holds it up, and you knock it out of his hand?

01:56:15.473 --> 01:56:16.530
SAM: Yeah.

01:56:16.530 --> 01:56:19.648
MATT: Hold on a second, I got to make a roll
here.

01:56:20.539 --> 01:56:24.325
TRAVIS: We all go down in a blaze of glory.

01:56:24.672 --> 01:56:28.462
MATT: There's a lot of gunpowder on this ship.

01:56:28.878 --> 01:56:32.333
SAM: Well, they shouldn't be using candles, then!

01:56:33.529 --> 01:56:34.962
MATT: Yeah, you're fine.

01:56:34.962 --> 01:56:37.159
TRAVIS: You fucking fuck.

01:56:37.159 --> 01:56:41.214
MATT: The lantern hits the ground and tips over,
and a little bit of oil spills out, but it doesn't

01:56:41.214 --> 01:56:45.638
like scatter and ignite. He's like, "Shit!" and he
quickly goes and picks it back up again. While

01:56:45.638 --> 01:56:49.485
you're investigating, the first couple crates you
can get to without making any sort of noise that

01:56:49.485 --> 01:56:57.017
gets his attention, you can tell, you lift up the
top ones. The first one you come to is filled with hardtack.

01:56:57.017 --> 01:56:58.605
SAM: Ugh.

01:56:58.605 --> 01:57:03.895
MATT: The second one you come to, a smell gets
your attention immediately, and you lift it up,

01:57:03.895 --> 01:57:08.978
and it does have a similar smell to that gunpowder
type material that you encountered on that pistol.

01:57:08.978 --> 01:57:12.782
SAM: Are they in bags, pouches, boxes? Is it just
loose?

01:57:12.782 --> 01:57:16.407
MATT: You see small kegs that are currently closed
off.

01:57:16.407 --> 01:57:17.912
SAM: I'll take a keg.

01:57:17.912 --> 01:57:19.152
MATT: Okay, it's about that big.

01:57:19.152 --> 01:57:20.258
SAM: Yep.

01:57:20.258 --> 01:57:21.817
MATT: You're going to pull it out, you got one.

01:57:21.817 --> 01:57:23.992
SAM: Okay, next box.

01:57:23.992 --> 01:57:27.423
MATT: Okay, he's now picked up the lantern again
because you've looked through two crates now.

01:57:27.423 --> 01:57:43.168
SAM: Okay, shit. I'll use that Mage Hand again.
This time, I'll unbuckle his belt.

01:57:44.246 --> 01:57:47.602
MATT: He's clutching that lantern with a death
grip now, and is now scanning the room, and

01:57:47.602 --> 01:57:52.178
suddenly his pants (whoosh) to the ground. He's
like, "Whoa, shit!" and he's reaching down with

01:57:52.178 --> 01:57:55.881
the other hand trying to pull it up, and he's got
like the lantern in one hand, his hand on the

01:57:55.881 --> 01:58:01.684
outside of the pants in the other. He's tripping a
bit and bumps into one of the crates. You manage

01:58:01.684 --> 01:58:05.576
to get to a third crate. You open it up and look
inside, and it looks like it's a bunch of coiled

01:58:05.576 --> 01:58:11.846
rope. It's a lot of repair materials for the ship.
There's a thick tar-like substance. It's probably

01:58:11.846 --> 01:58:14.063
used for some form of repairs.

01:58:14.063 --> 01:58:16.812
SAM: Okay, well can I get to one more box?

01:58:16.812 --> 01:58:18.412
MATT: Okay, he gets his pants up.

01:58:18.412 --> 01:58:19.292
SAM: Okay.

01:58:19.292 --> 01:58:22.711
MATT: He's now in the process of walking through
the room. Is there anything else you're going to do?

01:58:22.711 --> 01:58:32.041
SAM: Ooh, I have things. I have things! I have
some shards of shiny pottery. I will throw them

01:58:32.041 --> 01:58:35.106
across the room.

01:58:35.106 --> 01:58:36.863
MATT: Make a dexterity check.

01:58:36.863 --> 01:58:38.209
LAURA: Oh my god.

01:58:38.209 --> 01:58:39.701
SAM: You said dexterity?

01:58:39.701 --> 01:58:41.548
MATT: Yes. Something you're good at.

01:58:41.548 --> 01:58:44.594
SAM: 13.

01:58:44.594 --> 01:58:51.463
MATT: Okay! It (whoosh) (clattering), the small
shatter. The guy's like, "Who goes there?"

01:58:51.463 --> 01:58:56.108
(grunting) He goes walking in that direction. You
get one final crate that you get to. You pull it

01:58:56.108 --> 01:59:03.679
open. Looking inside, it looks to be-- I'm sorry
there isn't a whole lot more to find, but most of

01:59:03.679 --> 01:59:11.707
the cargo here is food. You find a lot of an older
set of fruit, maybe various things that were

01:59:11.707 --> 01:59:15.997
brought from their last destination. The smell
immediately hits you, of like fermenting orange

01:59:15.997 --> 01:59:23.270
and other types of various sweet, or at least now
sweet, and fermented fruit.

01:59:23.270 --> 01:59:24.678
SAM: Yeah, I'll grab some of that, too.

01:59:24.678 --> 01:59:28.989
MATT: Okay. You quickly fill your pockets. It's
squishy to the touch. When they put it in there,

01:59:28.989 --> 01:59:36.029
it (squish) on the inside. You feel it, the cold
wetness of it, spilling against your shirt. You

01:59:36.029 --> 01:59:37.861
get some pockets filled with fermented fruit.

01:59:37.861 --> 01:59:39.403
SAM: Okay, so I got an armful of gunpowder.

01:59:39.403 --> 01:59:40.750
MATT: Yep.

01:59:40.750 --> 01:59:42.322
SAM: Armful of rotting fruit.

01:59:42.322 --> 01:59:43.204
MATT: Yeah.

01:59:43.204 --> 01:59:44.405
SAM: That's a success.

01:59:44.405 --> 01:59:49.746
[cheering]

01:59:49.746 --> 01:59:51.110
MATT: You make your way back?

01:59:51.110 --> 01:59:52.117
SAM: I'm going to head back, yeah.

01:59:52.117 --> 01:59:53.311
MATT: Okay, make another stealth check.

01:59:53.311 --> 01:59:55.641
SAM: Oh boy, with advantage, I hope?

01:59:55.641 --> 01:59:56.567
MATT: Yep.

01:59:56.567 --> 02:00:00.560
SAM: Not needed. 29.

02:00:00.560 --> 02:00:02.377
LAURA: What?

02:00:02.377 --> 02:00:05.139
[cheering]

02:00:05.139 --> 02:00:10.544
MATT: That's money well spent for you guys. Thank
Mr. Pumat Sol for getting you that ability.

02:00:10.544 --> 02:00:11.532
SAM: That's right.

02:00:11.532 --> 02:00:16.580
[cheering]

02:00:16.580 --> 02:00:21.524
MATT: You make your way back. While this is
happening, you guys can hear the argument outside

02:00:21.524 --> 02:00:28.894
from the other guards, and the captain lambasting
them for pulling her out of her quarters, for

02:00:28.894 --> 02:00:34.062
telling ghost stories, and getting her excited
that Jamedi had returned, when he actually hasn't.

02:00:34.062 --> 02:00:41.008
Then they go quiet, you hear the footsteps come by
your room, and the door opens. The captain looks

02:00:41.008 --> 02:00:45.646
inside and goes, "Captain Fjord, care to join
me?"

02:00:45.646 --> 02:00:52.069
[wolf whistling]

02:00:52.069 --> 02:00:55.360
TRAVIS: But of course.

02:00:58.038 --> 02:01:01.416
MATT: "Right this way." She walks and heads
towards her quarters.

02:01:01.416 --> 02:01:05.126
LIAM: Caleb's Alarm spell is going, ding a ling a
ling.

02:01:05.126 --> 02:01:08.935
MATT: Yep. You follow her?

02:01:08.935 --> 02:01:10.659
TRAVIS: I do.

02:01:10.659 --> 02:01:14.064
MATT: As you follow the captain, quickly behind,
Nott, you make your way into the chamber.

02:01:14.064 --> 02:01:15.781
SAM: (quick footsteps)

02:01:15.781 --> 02:01:16.817
MATT: Close the door behind you.

02:01:16.817 --> 02:01:18.475
SAM: (panting)

02:01:18.475 --> 02:01:21.033
LAURA: Oh, what is that smell?

02:01:21.033 --> 02:01:35.907
SAM: Oh, I got some old mango and papaya. These, I
think they used to be oranges. I got this. This is

02:01:35.907 --> 02:01:41.394
a keg of black powder. It goes boom. It's like a
bomb.

02:01:41.394 --> 02:01:44.241
ASHLEY: Whoa.

02:01:44.241 --> 02:01:47.673
SAM: Yeah. We can use it to blow shit up.

02:01:47.673 --> 02:01:50.065
LAURA: That's amazing. Are we going to blow up the
ship?

02:01:50.065 --> 02:01:56.056
SAM: We could. I found out that there's lots of
black powder downstairs. If we wanted to make a

02:01:56.056 --> 02:02:02.354
getaway or something, we could go in, set it off,
blow it up. Everyone would die, yeah!

02:02:02.354 --> 02:02:05.771
[laughter]

02:02:05.771 --> 02:02:11.468
LIAM: Would you do me a favor, just as a rule,
maybe keep that ten feet away from me, please?

02:02:11.468 --> 02:02:14.703
SAM: Oh sorry, Caleb, yes. Of course.

02:02:14.703 --> 02:02:16.991
LIAM: No, it's useful, just you know, oil and
water.

02:02:16.991 --> 02:02:18.223
SAM: Okay.

02:02:18.223 --> 02:02:21.450
MARISHA: You are a walking hazard right now.

02:02:21.450 --> 02:02:24.799
SAM: I just had the itch.

02:02:24.799 --> 02:02:29.154
MARISHA: No, look, I'm not shaming you for that.
I'm just saying maybe we should put the black

02:02:29.154 --> 02:02:30.533
powder in the haversack.

02:02:30.533 --> 02:02:31.435
SAM: Oh, good idea.

02:02:31.435 --> 02:02:33.687
LAURA: Oh yeah, give it to me, that's smart.

02:02:33.687 --> 02:02:41.527
[laughter]

02:02:41.527 --> 02:02:46.267
MATT: There you go. While that's happening, Fjord,
you make your way to the captain's quarters.

02:02:46.267 --> 02:02:50.495
MARISHA: Woo!

02:02:50.495 --> 02:02:54.109
MATT: Walk behind and close the door. And that's
where we're going to take a break.

02:02:54.109 --> 02:02:55.842
TRAVIS: Oh, motherfucker!

02:02:55.842 --> 02:02:57.930
[cheering]

02:02:57.930 --> 02:02:59.031
SAM: I think we're taking a break.

02:02:59.031 --> 02:03:00.193
LAURA: Okay.

02:03:00.193 --> 02:03:02.213
(Sam muttering)

02:03:02.213 --> 02:03:03.896
LAURA: We've got to figure out the code word.

02:03:03.896 --> 02:03:08.838
MATT: We'll be right back here in a few minutes.
We're going to take a quick break. Be patient, but

02:03:08.838 --> 02:03:11.500
yeah, we'll see you here shortly, guys.

02:03:11.500 --> 02:03:17.085
[cheering]

02:03:17.085 --> 02:03:25.686
BRIAN: All right, everybody find their seats.
Everybody find their seats, please. Hey. That's

02:03:25.686 --> 02:03:33.173
your seat? That looks very comfortable. No, I
don't want to watch that. (laughs) How you guys

02:03:33.173 --> 02:03:34.852
doing so far?

02:03:34.852 --> 02:03:37.786
[cheering]

02:03:37.786 --> 02:03:43.097
BRIAN: Man, this is fun. There's trash. Oh no,
these are-- Oh, someone wrote a letter, how sweet.

02:03:43.097 --> 02:03:51.275
Okay, this is for Ashley. I thought Sam just threw
shit off the table and, like, whatever else. Okay,

02:03:51.275 --> 02:04:00.846
let's see. Oh no, that's a subpoena. We'll just
put that there. All right, guys, I can't hear what

02:04:00.846 --> 02:04:07.749
you're saying. I'm so sorry. Later on tonight,
I'll think, "What was that, hmm?" Guys, before we

02:04:07.749 --> 02:04:17.141
bring the cast back out, we have a very special
guest here tonight. This person is no bigger fan

02:04:17.141 --> 02:04:27.532
of the show or of you, the Critters, none other
than the person who we have to thank for Mr. Sam

02:04:27.532 --> 02:04:29.930
Riegel, it's Momlan.

02:04:29.930 --> 02:04:38.757
[cheering]

02:04:38.757 --> 02:04:44.050
BRIAN: Look at this. She's got her dice bag. Oh my
god.

02:04:44.050 --> 02:04:45.412
LENORE: I'm ready to go here.

02:04:45.412 --> 02:04:46.438
BRIAN: Say hi to everybody.

02:04:46.438 --> 02:04:49.077
LENORE: Hi, everybody, I'm so excited to be here.

02:04:49.077 --> 02:04:54.646
[cheering]

02:04:54.646 --> 02:04:58.593
BRIAN: Momlan and I have been watching the show
from upstairs, and it's so much fun. Are you

02:04:58.593 --> 02:04:59.519
having a good time?

02:04:59.519 --> 02:05:01.602
LENORE: I'm having the best time of my life.

02:05:01.602 --> 02:05:07.589
BRIAN: Are you-- yes! Are you so happy to see so
many great Critters in your home of New York?

02:05:07.589 --> 02:05:10.767
LENORE: I love all Critters, and I feel the love.

02:05:10.767 --> 02:05:16.564
BRIAN: I love it. Okay, why don't you welcome back
the cast.

02:05:16.564 --> 02:05:23.409
LENORE: Okay, great, wow, I'm glad to say this.
Welcome back, the cast of Critical Role!

02:05:23.409 --> 02:05:24.661
BRIAN: Yes!

02:05:24.661 --> 02:05:26.636
[cheering]

02:05:26.636 --> 02:05:28.504
BRIAN: Okay, let's go over here, and we'll do that
part over here.

02:05:28.504 --> 02:05:39.737
[cheering]

02:05:39.737 --> 02:05:50.293
BRIAN: Hmm, hmm, hmm. Okay, before we get started,
Momlan told me backstage that you have a question

02:05:50.293 --> 02:05:54.695
that you've always wanted to ask Matt Mercer since
you've been watching the show.

02:05:54.695 --> 02:05:56.945
LENORE: Yes. I want to ask Matt a question. Matt.

02:05:56.945 --> 02:05:58.292
MATT: Yes?

02:05:58.292 --> 02:05:59.952
LENORE: What time is it?

02:05:59.952 --> 02:06:11.509
[cheering]

02:06:11.509 --> 02:06:13.985
BRIAN: Let's go, wait.

02:06:13.985 --> 02:06:16.996
MATT: Only because it's you.

02:06:16.996 --> 02:06:19.022
BRIAN: What's that?

02:06:19.022 --> 02:06:21.368
MATT: (as McCree) It's high noon.

02:06:21.368 --> 02:06:30.964
BRIAN: Oh man. You're welcome, New York! You're
welcome. Take a bow.

02:06:31.400 --> 02:06:36.728
MATT: That was the Momlan free pass. Enjoy it
while you can.

02:06:36.728 --> 02:06:38.666
BRIAN: Oh man! I told you--

02:06:38.666 --> 02:06:41.222
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

02:06:41.222 --> 02:06:43.785
SAM: Are we back, are we on?

02:06:43.785 --> 02:06:45.402
MATT: I believe we're back.

02:06:45.402 --> 02:06:51.706
SAM: Hey, before we go, can I just say, there was
one special Critter here who got the farthest back

02:06:51.706 --> 02:07:00.730
seat in the entire theater, someone who is in
balcony, row K, seat 32. If you look next to your

02:07:00.730 --> 02:07:10.210
seat, I left you a little present. That's you, way
back in the back corner right there, you.

02:07:10.210 --> 02:07:13.912
LIAM: He shit under the chair.

02:07:14.360 --> 02:07:21.642
SAM: Just look to the right of your seat, balcony
row K, seat 32. Okay, good.

02:07:22.877 --> 02:07:25.230
MATT: Look at this.

02:07:25.230 --> 02:07:30.872
SAM: It's the wrong person. It's that person up
there. They'll never find it. It's going to be

02:07:30.872 --> 02:07:34.173
found in like six years from now.

02:07:34.173 --> 02:07:37.529
MATT: Look at this theater of beautiful faces.
This is absolutely surreal.

02:07:37.529 --> 02:07:43.071
[cheering]

02:07:43.071 --> 02:07:44.982
TRAVIS and MATT: (groaning)

02:07:44.982 --> 02:07:47.051
AUDIENCE MEMBER: We love you!

02:07:47.051 --> 02:07:50.456
MATT: You guys are amazing. I love you too!

02:07:50.456 --> 02:07:54.829
[cheering]

02:07:54.829 --> 02:08:01.250
But it is not the time for loving. Well...

02:08:01.250 --> 02:08:04.592
[cheering]

02:08:04.592 --> 02:08:07.471
MATT: It is the time for Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons.

02:08:07.471 --> 02:08:10.608
[cheering]

02:08:10.608 --> 02:08:12.746
LIAM: Why not both?

02:08:12.746 --> 02:08:23.995
MATT: Picking up where we left off. Fjord.

02:08:23.995 --> 02:08:27.815
SAM: They finally found it.

02:08:29.575 --> 02:08:31.209
MARISHA: You got this.

02:08:31.209 --> 02:08:32.648
MATT: You walk into the Captain's chambers.

02:08:32.648 --> 02:08:35.451
TRAVIS: Yep.

02:08:35.700 --> 02:08:41.013
MATT: Closing the door behind you, it's dark lit,
the back door is open to the balcony out there,

02:08:41.013 --> 02:08:51.480
and you can hear the waves crash against the ship.
There are a few candles lit in the room where they

02:08:51.480 --> 02:08:53.845
were before.

02:08:53.845 --> 02:08:55.892
SAM: Bow bow bow!

02:08:55.892 --> 02:09:00.720
MATT: The captain is standing in the doorway and
looking out over the ocean, and as soon as the

02:09:00.720 --> 02:09:16.772
door closes behind, turns around and goes, "I
would like to talk with you about how you've been

02:09:16.824 --> 02:09:21.208
"reached out to, how you are touched by--"

02:09:21.208 --> 02:09:22.807
SAM: Code word.

02:09:22.807 --> 02:09:33.356
MATT: "This magnificent entity, Uk'otoa. There's
been a very long time since I've met anyone else

02:09:33.356 --> 02:09:37.667
"chosen, so please, tell me how this happened."

02:09:37.667 --> 02:09:42.722
LIAM: Before this goes any further, because I'm
fascinated--

02:09:42.722 --> 02:09:44.433
MATT: Yeah.

02:09:44.433 --> 02:09:51.192
LIAM: I would like to attempt to go into Frumpkin,
the one-ounce elf owl, if possible.

02:09:51.192 --> 02:09:53.538
MATT: Yep. Frumpkin is still up on the deck.

02:09:53.538 --> 02:09:58.844
LIAM: Yeah, I remember where that room was, so
Frumpkin is taking a little fly around.

02:09:58.844 --> 02:10:02.111
MARISHA: (owl hooting)

02:10:02.745 --> 02:10:06.106
SAM: It's better when somebody's watching.

02:10:08.992 --> 02:10:14.206
MATT: Frumpkin goes and perches on the outer
balcony of the Squalleater.

02:10:14.206 --> 02:10:19.970
TRAVIS: Captain, I admit, I too am very encouraged
to find someone that seems to have gone through

02:10:19.970 --> 02:10:26.050
the same sort of visions and trials that I have.
You said it's been a long time since you've met

02:10:26.050 --> 02:10:33.511
another chosen. Are you saying you've met
previous? I found myself feeling I was the only

02:10:33.511 --> 02:10:39.496
one that was experiencing this vision.

02:10:39.496 --> 02:10:46.832
SAM: (coughing) I thought you were going to say
something else.

02:10:46.832 --> 02:10:51.503
MATT: She leans her shoulder against the doorway,
looking over at your eyes, distantly reaching for

02:10:51.503 --> 02:11:05.365
memories, and goes, "There has been one other.
It's been many years. This came to me through a

02:11:05.365 --> 02:11:16.465
"series of unexpected--" You see her searching for
the right words and says, "I've always considered

02:11:16.465 --> 02:11:32.093
"myself a very lucky person. At first I thought
this was a terrible portent, when this beautiful

02:11:32.093 --> 02:11:45.812
"Uk'otoa spoke to me. It was a purpose that nobody
else in Darktow was going on, and with that I

02:11:45.812 --> 02:11:53.630
"began to gather my crew. It took a while, but each
of them began to believe as well. All of them

02:11:53.630 --> 02:12:01.825
"support, and when this is done, the blessing is
high. Nay, he is unstoppable behind me as

02:12:01.825 --> 02:12:04.202
"I am on the sea."

02:12:04.202 --> 02:12:15.113
TRAVIS: The blessing, you say? I haven't heard
speak blessing. I've heard words of encouragement.

02:12:15.113 --> 02:12:18.322
And your crew believes as you do?

02:12:18.322 --> 02:12:24.454
MATT: "They have now, yes. I've read the books,
I've looked up about the Ki'Nau. I've learned of

02:12:24.454 --> 02:12:38.202
"the history. As they once were the masters of the
Lucidian Ocean so too will be I. So too can be us."

02:12:38.202 --> 02:12:42.506
TRAVIS: I look forward to this very, very much. I
noticed, as we were leaving your quarters, that

02:12:42.506 --> 02:12:49.738
beautiful iron piece above your doorway. A snake
circling back upon itself, the eye in the middle,

02:12:49.738 --> 02:12:55.027
but it seemed there were small eyes all around the
body of the snake.

02:12:55.027 --> 02:13:03.262
MATT: "They say that Uk'otoa is an infinite length
entity, a serpent that entwines the entirety of

02:13:03.262 --> 02:13:11.905
"the water. That is but eyes across its body to see
what else it must conquer."

02:13:11.905 --> 02:13:13.586
TRAVIS: That sounds--

02:13:13.586 --> 02:13:15.463
MATT: "Beautiful?"

02:13:15.463 --> 02:13:24.877
TRAVIS: Exactly the word I was searching for.
Speaking of beautiful.

02:13:24.877 --> 02:13:26.183
SAM: Oh!

02:13:26.183 --> 02:13:37.412
[cheering]

02:13:37.412 --> 02:13:44.747
TRAVIS: I was so taken by that marking, that
tattoo you had, I was wondering if you might show

02:13:44.747 --> 02:13:48.067
it to me again?

02:13:50.152 --> 02:13:53.646
LIAM: I think they're about to get naked.

02:13:53.646 --> 02:13:56.762
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

02:13:56.762 --> 02:14:01.848
TRAVIS: I'm uncomfortable with what's happening.
Natural 20.

02:14:01.848 --> 02:14:20.552
[cheering]

02:14:20.552 --> 02:14:28.573
MATT: She tugs down the scarf to reveal the tattoo
without breaking eye contact and goes, "I'll do

02:14:28.573 --> 02:14:30.004
"you one better."

02:14:30.004 --> 02:14:33.505
[cheering]

02:14:33.505 --> 02:14:35.435
SAM: Zip?

02:14:36.182 --> 02:14:44.112
MATT: Removes the glove off of her right hand, and
in the palm you see a familiar yellow eye emerging

02:14:44.112 --> 02:14:58.313
from the center. "This is the blessing. It leaves
the first stage. I have been chosen to be one step

02:14:58.313 --> 02:15:01.231
"to his unsealing."

02:15:01.231 --> 02:15:06.345
TRAVIS: Like, a fucking eye or a tattoo of an
eye?

02:15:06.345 --> 02:15:08.797
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:15:11.428 --> 02:15:13.190
TRAVIS: 16.

02:15:13.190 --> 02:15:23.351
MATT: You hope it's a tattoo, but the way the
candle light hits it looks smooth and somewhat glassy.

02:15:23.351 --> 02:15:31.429
TRAVIS: Oh god. Fuck, that's getting weird.

02:15:31.429 --> 02:15:38.653
[cheering]

02:15:38.653 --> 02:15:44.307
TRAVIS:That's some Pan Labyrinth's bullshit going
on. (clears throat) My, my.

02:15:44.307 --> 02:15:52.275
[laughter]

02:15:53.929 --> 02:16:01.818
TRAVIS: Fuck it, I feel now you and I are more
connected than I could've ever imagined. I'll

02:16:01.818 --> 02:16:03.844
summon the sword.

02:16:04.020 --> 02:16:09.254
[cheering]

02:16:09.254 --> 02:16:13.983
MATT: With a flash and a scattering of ocean water
across the far wall of the chamber, the falchion

02:16:13.983 --> 02:16:16.301
emerges in your grasp.

02:16:16.301 --> 02:16:21.305
[applause]

02:16:21.305 --> 02:16:22.970
MATT: It's what it's always done!

02:16:22.970 --> 02:16:27.177
[cheering]

02:16:27.177 --> 02:16:30.627
MARISHA: Wait, which sword, what do you mean
"sword"?!

02:16:30.627 --> 02:16:34.527
LIAM: Caleb can't hear any of this, but in the
middle of the room he says: It is getting very

02:16:34.527 --> 02:16:38.047
kinky in that room.

02:16:38.047 --> 02:16:40.564
MARISHA: Goddamn it.

02:16:40.564 --> 02:16:44.701
LAURA: Jester's just pacing back and forth.

02:16:44.701 --> 02:16:48.970
MATT: She immediately takes a step forward, like
holding her palm forward still. Not even looking

02:16:48.970 --> 02:16:54.577
at you, just looking at the sword and specifically
focusing on the eye in the center of the hilt.

02:16:54.577 --> 02:17:06.425
She's speechless for a moment, you hear her
breathe in suddenly, "Perhaps it was destiny."

02:17:06.425 --> 02:17:15.131
TRAVIS: Perhaps it was. Do you know what will
happen, if we--?

02:17:15.131 --> 02:17:22.549
LAURA: (suggestive clicking) Sorry. I'm sorry, I'm
sorry!

02:17:22.549 --> 02:17:33.894
[laughter]

02:17:33.894 --> 02:17:40.987
TRAVIS: Do you know what will happen, if we take
this sphere to the place of its choosing? Have you

02:17:40.987 --> 02:17:45.958
seen what's unleashed or have you only heard?

02:17:45.958 --> 02:17:57.229
MATT: "I've only heard. As far as I know, when
these survivors of Zehir, this long sealed god

02:17:57.229 --> 02:18:04.316
"grew jealous, that they are the ones, who put
Uk'otoa away, below the ocean."

02:18:04.316 --> 02:18:07.136
SAM: (whispering) Uk'otoa!

02:18:07.930 --> 02:18:19.121
MATT: "If I'm correct, and this is one of the
original temples, then I think we can bring him back."

02:18:22.562 --> 02:18:26.000
TRAVIS: I admit, I find myself very curious.

02:18:26.768 --> 02:18:29.825
MATT: "This is but one, there are three I know
of."

02:18:29.825 --> 02:18:30.946
TRAVIS: Three temples?

02:18:30.946 --> 02:18:34.457
MATT: "Three temples across the Swavain islands."

02:18:35.258 --> 02:18:40.768
TRAVIS: All of the same construct, all looking for
the same, what do you call it?

02:18:40.768 --> 02:18:48.198
MATT: "I don't know if there's a name for it, I
just call it the sphere. The eye."

02:18:48.198 --> 02:18:49.729
TRAVIS: Same.

02:18:49.729 --> 02:19:01.182
MATT: "I'll be honest, the dreams, that I have,
it's mostly just feeling and an occasional word,

02:19:01.182 --> 02:19:13.903
"like he's being held back. I feel that if we can,
one by one, release him from these bindings, he

02:19:13.903 --> 02:19:24.696
"can be more direct with us. Be more direct with
his blessing. He will bequeath the sea unto us."

02:19:24.696 --> 02:19:26.807
TRAVIS: My god, the sea.

02:19:26.807 --> 02:19:30.459
[laughter]

02:19:30.459 --> 02:19:38.721
TRAVIS: What does the eye say to you? Anything you
remember?

02:19:38.721 --> 02:19:47.774
MATT: "Tells me to, to watch, to learn."

02:19:47.774 --> 02:19:50.748
LAURA: (grunting)

02:19:52.354 --> 02:19:54.713
TRAVIS: To consume?

02:19:55.850 --> 02:19:57.658
MATT: "To consume."

02:19:57.658 --> 02:20:05.169
[cheering and laughter]

02:20:05.169 --> 02:20:06.590
MARISHA: Oh my god.

02:20:06.590 --> 02:20:09.054
SAM: Oh my god, Matt and Travis are going to make
out.

02:20:09.054 --> 02:20:19.704
[cheering]

02:20:19.704 --> 02:20:23.669
LIAM: It's just so much, you guys, it's just so
much.

02:20:23.669 --> 02:20:24.779
MARISHA: Details.

02:20:24.779 --> 02:20:26.707
LAURA: What is happening?!

02:20:26.707 --> 02:20:31.855
TRAVIS: I confess, having spent so much time on
the water, the command over it seems like too

02:20:31.855 --> 02:20:36.942
great a gift to receive, but I crave it.

02:20:36.942 --> 02:20:44.312
[cheering]

02:20:44.312 --> 02:20:45.945
MATT: She steps around the desk.

02:20:45.945 --> 02:20:47.122
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck.

02:20:47.122 --> 02:20:49.518
[cheering]

02:20:49.518 --> 02:20:59.691
MATT: Just places her fingers on the hilt of the
sword, where the eye is. "Then you'll need your rest."

02:21:03.776 --> 02:21:06.990
TRAVIS: Indeed.

02:21:06.990 --> 02:21:08.753
MARISHA: M'lady.

02:21:08.753 --> 02:21:10.686
TRAVIS: We will all.

02:21:10.686 --> 02:21:14.475
[laughter]

02:21:14.475 --> 02:21:22.898
TRAVIS: I will put my hand on hers and say: We
will all need our rest for the trials to come.

02:21:22.898 --> 02:21:32.476
Thank you for sharing your story with me, I don't
feel quite as alone in this.

02:21:32.476 --> 02:21:35.279
MATT: "Thank you for your honesty, eventually."

02:21:35.279 --> 02:21:37.561
[laughter]

02:21:37.561 --> 02:21:40.448
TRAVIS: It's like an onion, you got to peel it,
you know.

02:21:40.448 --> 02:21:55.003
MATT: "Understood. Anyway," and she pulls her hand
away, "Go, and may sweet dreams find you."

02:21:55.003 --> 02:22:01.546
[cheering]

02:22:01.546 --> 02:22:06.810
TRAVIS: I turn and I head towards the door and as
I get there, I look back.

02:22:06.810 --> 02:22:14.114
[applause]

02:22:14.114 --> 02:22:16.046
TRAVIS: And I walk away!

02:22:16.046 --> 02:22:20.369
[cheering]

02:22:20.369 --> 02:22:21.966
MARISHA: That was fucking awesome.

02:22:21.966 --> 02:22:35.299
[cheering]

02:22:35.389 --> 02:22:37.104
LAURA: Oh my god.

02:22:37.249 --> 02:22:41.538
LIAM: I thought they were going to make bumsen,
but it did not happen.

02:22:41.538 --> 02:22:43.914
LAURA: They didn't, they didn't, they didn't?!

02:22:43.914 --> 02:22:46.097
MATT: At this point, the door opens and Fjord
returns to the room.

02:22:46.097 --> 02:22:50.791
MARISHA: We weren't listening to anything at all,
we know everything. Can you please fill in the details?

02:22:50.791 --> 02:22:53.744
LAURA: What was going on, what did you guys do?
Huh?

02:22:54.239 --> 02:22:57.400
SAM: Want a seven-day-old banana?

02:23:00.799 --> 02:23:12.382
TRAVIS: No, thank you. Where did that even come
from? That's okay. Not much actually. She is far

02:23:12.382 --> 02:23:19.374
more under the influence of whatever this is than
I initially thought. She took off her glove and

02:23:19.374 --> 02:23:30.173
there was an eye in the palm of her hand. And not
another tattoo, I think it was like a fucking eye. Ah!

02:23:31.379 --> 02:23:33.197
LAURA: Ew!

02:23:33.197 --> 02:23:36.521
TRAVIS: Yeah, I know. So she showed me hers and I
showed her mine.

02:23:36.521 --> 02:23:37.820
LAURA: Oh.

02:23:38.750 --> 02:23:42.239
TRAVIS: Eyes! Our eyes! On the sword.

02:23:42.239 --> 02:23:43.000
LAURA: Right.

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.329
SAM: Did you tell her the orb was inside of you?

02:23:45.329 --> 02:23:46.487
TRAVIS: I did not.

02:23:46.651 --> 02:23:50.492
LAURA: Well, I'm assuming, if she's got the
eyeball on her hand, she has an orb inside of her, Fjord?

02:23:50.492 --> 02:23:51.599
TRAVIS: Fuck.

02:23:51.599 --> 02:23:52.972
LAURA: Yeah!

02:23:52.972 --> 02:23:55.542
TRAVIS: I didn't even think of that.

02:23:55.542 --> 02:23:57.626
LAURA: I mean it's got to be, right?

02:23:57.626 --> 02:23:58.729
TRAVIS: Yep.

02:23:58.729 --> 02:24:02.497
LIAM: Question. I am still watching her.

02:24:02.497 --> 02:24:09.894
[cheering]

02:24:09.894 --> 02:24:13.653
TRAVIS: What the fuck do you mean "still"?

02:24:13.653 --> 02:24:26.752
[cheering]

02:24:26.752 --> 02:24:31.507
LIAM: I know it's confusing; I like to stay inside
this Zemnian accent so much, but I did not say

02:24:31.507 --> 02:24:33.778
that out loud. That was for the DM.

02:24:33.778 --> 02:24:35.940
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

02:24:38.975 --> 02:24:40.901
MATT: Question, Caleb?

02:24:40.901 --> 02:24:45.678
LIAM: Yeah, I did not stop watching her after he
left.

02:24:45.678 --> 02:24:46.382
MATT: Right.

02:24:46.382 --> 02:24:47.323
LIAM: What is she doing?

02:24:47.323 --> 02:24:48.998
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:24:48.998 --> 02:24:50.051
LIAM: Okay.

02:24:50.051 --> 02:24:53.519
TALIESIN: Roll well.

02:24:53.519 --> 02:24:55.462
LIAM: Just a ten.

02:24:55.462 --> 02:25:03.490
MATT: Okay. You watch as she takes her glove and
puts it back on, looking at her palm as she does.

02:25:03.490 --> 02:25:07.811
Looks out over the ocean and steps out to the
railing, where she has to move away to get out of

02:25:07.811 --> 02:25:17.272
the visual perspective, and spends a minute or so
looking over the water. Then turns back, goes and

02:25:17.272 --> 02:25:25.389
closes the door, walks over to underneath the main
doorway, where that shrine is. She pulls a stool

02:25:25.389 --> 02:25:32.823
up to stand up to about eye level to where the
shrine is. Then she pulls her glove off once more,

02:25:32.823 --> 02:25:39.096
makes a small cut on her finger, and drops a few
pieces of blood onto the small iron shrine. It's

02:25:39.096 --> 02:25:45.712
maybe about that big and then puts the glove back
on, mumbles a few words beneath her breath, though

02:25:45.712 --> 02:25:52.094
Frumpkin might not able to see from this
perspective. Then goes ahead and snuffs the candles.

02:25:52.094 --> 02:25:59.781
LIAM: So she did some arcane shit. Did she also
look very hot and bothered?

02:26:00.569 --> 02:26:04.600
MATT: With that perception roll, I'd say you don't
know.

02:26:05.185 --> 02:26:08.065
TRAVIS: Yeah, but you know.

02:26:09.040 --> 02:26:17.370
MATT: I don't know, man. Not for me, I'm real bad
at seeing that.

02:26:18.592 --> 02:26:23.430
MARISHA: So eyeball, hand, you showed her yours.

02:26:23.430 --> 02:26:24.246
TRAVIS: Yep.

02:26:24.246 --> 02:26:30.765
MARISHA: Was she, I don't know, did she say
anything else about--

02:26:30.765 --> 02:26:36.665
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, you're right. She actually said
there was one before, that was also chosen.

02:26:36.665 --> 02:26:37.947
LAURA: What happened to him?

02:26:37.947 --> 02:26:40.319
SAM: Yeah, when you asked what happened to him,
what did she say?

02:26:40.319 --> 02:26:49.208
[laughter]

02:26:49.208 --> 02:26:59.539
TRAVIS: Where was that fucking pigeon? We didn't
get to that part, but I feel like, because I saw

02:26:59.539 --> 02:27:04.633
my former captain Vandren with the same sphere,
that he might be the one that she was talking about.

02:27:04.686 --> 02:27:08.634
LAURA: (gasping) Wait, wait, wait, wait.

02:27:08.634 --> 02:27:12.663
ALL: Wait.

02:27:12.663 --> 02:27:17.667
LAURA: What if Vandren had a different sphere?
What if there was like a whole bunch of them?

02:27:17.667 --> 02:27:22.303
TRAVIS: There's a chance. She said that this
temple that we're about to visit was one of three.

02:27:22.303 --> 02:27:26.224
LAURA: There's three. What if Vandren and you and
she have them?

02:27:26.224 --> 02:27:28.281
MARISHA: Yeah and they're all keys to the temple?

02:27:28.447 --> 02:27:32.548
LAURA: What if Vandren had one and then she knew
it and she killed Vandren. And now she's going to

02:27:32.548 --> 02:27:36.018
kill you and she's going to try to take your orb?

02:27:36.018 --> 02:27:40.218
TRAVIS: Jester, I don't think she killed Vandren.
He was on the ship when it exploded. I don't even--

02:27:40.218 --> 02:27:41.979
LAURA: How did the ship explode, Fjord?

02:27:41.979 --> 02:27:44.837
SAM: She has a ship with cannons.

02:27:45.778 --> 02:27:50.433
MARISHA: Also, Nott said that there's like a fuck
ton of gunpowder under the ship, so.

02:27:50.433 --> 02:27:56.501
TRAVIS: No, I understand. Sabian, my crewmate, he
went down and sabotaged the ship. He set off an

02:27:56.501 --> 02:27:58.677
explosion. That has to be what happened.

02:27:58.677 --> 02:28:04.151
LAURA: Who was Sabian working for? Avantika?

02:28:04.151 --> 02:28:10.354
MARISHA: If she has a sphere and can talk to the
serpent gods, I'm assuming she has some sort of

02:28:10.354 --> 02:28:18.465
magical powers, like you have magical powers. She
has cool robes and is wearing an amulet; that just

02:28:18.465 --> 02:28:20.011
screams magic.

02:28:20.011 --> 02:28:24.381
LIAM: Yeah, well, so after you, you know, made the
flirt talk, that I was watching.

02:28:24.381 --> 02:28:28.609
MARISHA: The flirt talk?

02:28:28.609 --> 02:28:31.643
LIAM: Oh, they were both pouring it on pretty
thick.

02:28:31.643 --> 02:28:37.353
TRAVIS: Well, I think we were being pretty
respectful.

02:28:37.353 --> 02:28:45.650
LIAM: That's a subjective thing, my friend.
Anyway, she is very interested in you and after

02:28:45.650 --> 02:28:54.458
you left her room, I watched a little bit longer
and she did some cutting. She dropped a little bit

02:28:54.458 --> 02:28:58.829
of her blood on a miniature altar or something. Do
you do this?

02:28:58.829 --> 02:29:03.342
TRAVIS: I do not. Altar, the little iron piece
above her doorway?

02:29:03.342 --> 02:29:07.518
LIAM: Yeah, she stood on a stool and she did a
little.

02:29:07.621 --> 02:29:11.902
TRAVIS: I saw that on the way out. I don't do
anything like that. I don't know what that would--

02:29:11.902 --> 02:29:17.710
ASHLEY: I have a question. She said that there was
somebody that was before her?

02:29:17.710 --> 02:29:23.639
TRAVIS: She did; she said there was one other
chosen besides herself and now me.

02:29:23.639 --> 02:29:31.054
ASHLEY: Did you look at her other, did you get a
closer look?

02:29:31.054 --> 02:29:33.689
TRAVIS: I did, the tattoo.

02:29:33.689 --> 02:29:36.232
ASHLEY: Did that look familiar?

02:29:36.232 --> 02:29:40.671
TRAVIS: Have I seen that anywhere else?

02:29:40.671 --> 02:29:46.622
MATT: To you I would say no, not in the time that
you saw it.

02:29:46.622 --> 02:29:52.082
TRAVIS: Didn't Molly have--?

02:29:52.082 --> 02:29:56.799
[cheering]

02:29:56.799 --> 02:30:02.878
TRAVIS: Did he have any tattoos that had eyes in
them? Like the peacock feathers?

02:30:02.878 --> 02:30:07.885
ASHLEY: He had nine of them.

02:30:07.885 --> 02:30:09.731
TALIESIN: She'd know.

02:30:09.731 --> 02:30:10.894
SAM: Nine.

02:30:10.894 --> 02:30:14.387
[laughter]

02:30:14.387 --> 02:30:15.888
TALIESIN: This one.

02:30:15.888 --> 02:30:17.524
SAM: Nine eyes?

02:30:18.354 --> 02:30:22.299
MARISHA: I mean, he also had that all-seeing eye
on his back, right?

02:30:22.299 --> 02:30:24.073
TRAVIS: What?

02:30:24.073 --> 02:30:25.413
[laughter]

02:30:25.413 --> 02:30:28.522
LAURA: I mean you roomed with him, Fjord didn't
you see him naked?

02:30:28.968 --> 02:30:30.429
TALIESIN: Yes.

02:30:30.429 --> 02:30:38.547
[cheering]

02:30:38.547 --> 02:30:39.518
TRAVIS: Sure.

02:30:39.518 --> 02:30:42.863
TALIESIN: Don't be a bad roommate. He was a bad
roommate, don't be a bad roommate.

02:30:42.863 --> 02:30:47.687
[laughter]

02:30:47.687 --> 02:30:52.806
ASHLEY and TRAVIS: Could be nothing.

02:30:52.806 --> 02:31:01.581
MARISHA: I mean, eyeballs. We all have two.
There's a lot of eyeballs around. Just saying

02:31:01.581 --> 02:31:03.796
things have eyes.

02:31:03.796 --> 02:31:05.726
TRAVIS: Yeah. Right.

02:31:05.726 --> 02:31:07.166
MARISHA: Just trying to be skeptical.

02:31:07.185 --> 02:31:08.725
TRAVIS: Yeah, I know.

02:31:08.725 --> 02:31:09.663
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:31:09.663 --> 02:31:14.298
TRAVIS: She said we should all get some rest. I
feel like we've earned some trust. I feel like

02:31:14.298 --> 02:31:21.767
we'll be in good hands. I don't know if I entirely
trust her, but I do feel like she is motivated to

02:31:21.767 --> 02:31:23.735
see where this leads.

02:31:23.735 --> 02:31:26.735
LIAM That's one way of putting it, ja.

02:31:27.908 --> 02:31:34.638
TRAVIS: I will say she seems a bit on the
fanatical end. She spoke of acquiring powers that

02:31:34.638 --> 02:31:38.892
I can't even begin to comprehend. Control over the
oceans and seas.

02:31:38.892 --> 02:31:39.977
LAURA: Whoa.

02:31:39.977 --> 02:31:43.057
TRAVIS: Or other follow--

02:31:43.057 --> 02:31:44.659
LAURA: What? It sounds cool.

02:31:44.659 --> 02:31:46.626
SAM: That's a lot, yeah, that's a big power.

02:31:46.626 --> 02:31:49.563
TRAVIS: But doesn't that sound like too much?

02:31:49.563 --> 02:31:53.348
TALIESIN: I mean, what would you even do with
that? What's the point of it, really?

02:31:53.348 --> 02:31:54.987
SAM: Well, I know what I would do with it.

02:31:54.987 --> 02:31:56.009
TALIESIN: What would you do with it?

02:31:56.009 --> 02:31:57.851
SAM: Get rid of the seas.

02:31:57.851 --> 02:32:03.051
[laughter]

02:32:03.051 --> 02:32:07.404
SAM: Tell them to go away and go somewhere else,
and have more land.

02:32:07.404 --> 02:32:11.927
TALIESIN: See, and that just a point of a higher
motivation for something. I mean, there's got to

02:32:11.927 --> 02:32:14.307
be a step two.

02:32:14.307 --> 02:32:21.892
LIAM: She seemed very maniacal, is the word that I
would choose. She seemed very driven.

02:32:21.892 --> 02:32:27.714
MARISHA: Deuce has a point, there's got to be a
goal at the end of all those powers, right?

02:32:27.714 --> 02:32:29.928
SAM: Well, we'll find out tomorrow, I suppose.

02:32:29.928 --> 02:32:35.134
TRAVIS: We will and in the meantime, I would
suggest that we acted like we are as interested

02:32:35.134 --> 02:32:42.386
and motivated to see this through as her
followers. Otherwise, I think we'll stick out.

02:32:42.386 --> 02:32:48.396
MARISHA: Did she say anything else about what she
wants?

02:32:48.396 --> 02:32:50.264
TRAVIS: No.

02:32:50.264 --> 02:32:54.107
LIAM: I mean, it sounded like she wanted power and
a lot of it.

02:32:54.107 --> 02:33:03.237
TRAVIS: She does. Unleashing things that are too
terrible to talk about, but you can use your imagination.

02:33:03.237 --> 02:33:07.497
SAM: Was that a dick joke?

02:33:07.497 --> 02:33:12.301
[laughter]

02:33:12.301 --> 02:33:14.466
TRAVIS: Nope.

02:33:14.466 --> 02:33:16.609
MARISHA: Jessie, are you all right?

02:33:16.609 --> 02:33:17.607
LAURA: I mean.

02:33:17.607 --> 02:33:21.925
MARISHA: You've just had this like really angry
face in the corner for a little bit.

02:33:21.925 --> 02:33:25.914
LAURA: Oh, I don't know what you're talking about
I'm just sitting there with my sketchbook, drawing

02:33:25.914 --> 02:33:33.606
Captain Avantika with daggers. Sticking into her
like a voodoo doll.

02:33:33.606 --> 02:33:36.392
TRAVIS: You're not drawing like this, you're
drawing like this?

02:33:36.392 --> 02:33:39.894
LAURA: Yeah, aggressively. I don't know what
you're talking about, I'm happy over here.

02:33:39.894 --> 02:33:47.278
MARISHA: No, it looks like the third pencil you've
broken so I just wanted to-- Just curious. Fourth.

02:33:47.793 --> 02:34:01.496
LIAM: Fjord, if we venture into this sticky
wicket, do you share even in a small way similar

02:34:01.496 --> 02:34:09.212
desires as this woman? Do you want to control the
sea?

02:34:09.212 --> 02:34:15.522
TRAVIS: It's the first time I've heard of it. I
mean, it sounds incredible, but I can't even begin

02:34:15.522 --> 02:34:22.423
to fathom what that would be like. That
responsibility, I don't know who I would be if I

02:34:22.423 --> 02:34:24.672
could wield something like that.

02:34:24.672 --> 02:34:30.590
LIAM: Well, you are grappling with a great deal of
power, we have watched you do it. Are you trying

02:34:30.590 --> 02:34:37.477
to understand this thing better, be free of it,
master it?

02:34:37.477 --> 02:34:40.174
TRAVIS: Understand it would be a start.

02:34:40.174 --> 02:34:46.478
TALIESIN: You can't know what to do until you
understand it. I mean, that's step one and once

02:34:46.478 --> 02:34:52.038
you understand it, we'll try and help you make a
reasonable decision about what to do with it.

02:34:52.038 --> 02:34:57.354
LAURA: What if the closer you get to it, the
weirder you get? What if you start feeling those

02:34:57.354 --> 02:35:00.107
urges, like she has and stuff.

02:35:00.107 --> 02:35:01.451
TRAVIS: What urges?

02:35:01.451 --> 02:35:04.741
LAURA: Like the powerful urges.

02:35:08.003 --> 02:35:09.557
MARISHA: That's a good question.

02:35:09.557 --> 02:35:21.716
TRAVIS: Well, I've asked Beau to check me and I'll
check her on areas of aggression. If I start

02:35:21.716 --> 02:35:26.038
controlling the oceans and shit, maybe we'll talk
about it.

02:35:26.038 --> 02:35:27.061
LAURA: Okay.

02:35:27.061 --> 02:35:33.355
TRAVIS: Until then, I can only tell you I only
want to know more about this and find out about

02:35:33.355 --> 02:35:39.903
what happened to my friend. That's as far as I'm
thinking.

02:35:39.903 --> 02:35:42.399
SAM: Let's do that, then.

02:35:42.399 --> 02:35:45.424
TALIESIN: I'm into it.

02:35:45.424 --> 02:35:47.176
MARISHA: Let's get some rest.

02:35:47.176 --> 02:35:48.726
TRAVIS: Try to sleep.

02:35:48.726 --> 02:35:50.431
MATT: You guys all get yourselves to sleep.

02:35:50.431 --> 02:35:56.933
LIAM: Yeah, I place the elf owl back on
Beauregard's shoulder and go to sleep.

02:35:56.933 --> 02:36:06.697
MATT: Okay, as you guys all find yourself to rest.
Is your mic not working?

02:36:06.697 --> 02:36:08.137
SAM: What?

02:36:08.137 --> 02:36:11.005
ASHLEY: Oh, no, it's not working.

02:36:11.005 --> 02:36:12.217
LAURA: No, it's not.

02:36:12.217 --> 02:36:13.234
SAM: We've lost Ashley.

02:36:13.234 --> 02:36:14.171
TRAVIS: Share with Tal.

02:36:14.171 --> 02:36:15.315
MATT: You share with Taliesin.

02:36:15.315 --> 02:36:18.188
LAURA: Wait.

02:36:18.188 --> 02:36:20.172
SAM: No, it's gone.

02:36:20.172 --> 02:36:31.606
MATT: We'll share, that's fine. So as you all go
to sleep, finding yourself into an evening of rest, Fjord--

02:36:31.606 --> 02:36:34.730
TRAVIS: No, goddamn it!

02:36:38.452 --> 02:36:40.990
SAM: Should we leave the stage, do we need to
leave the stage?

02:36:40.990 --> 02:36:42.358
TRAVIS: No!

02:36:42.358 --> 02:36:46.551
MATT: You don't need to. That was more helpful
earlier in the campaign, when everything was a

02:36:46.551 --> 02:36:56.678
super mystery. You spilled all the beans recently,
so it's fine. You walk in darkness, your eyes

02:36:56.678 --> 02:37:02.976
trained on a barely visible horizon of faded blue.
The lightless midnight horizon that breaks this

02:37:02.976 --> 02:37:10.148
endless void. The ground is soft beneath your feet
and your slow gait bounces slightly with each

02:37:10.148 --> 02:37:18.229
step. Like time is crawling in this buoyant space.
You look down at yourself, obscured by a shadow,

02:37:18.229 --> 02:37:24.385
until a faint yellow light bursts from your sword.
The light of a yellow eye now open from the hilt

02:37:24.385 --> 02:37:32.141
like a lantern, lighting a tangled forest of kelp
before you. Bubbles escape the corner of your

02:37:32.141 --> 02:37:46.547
mouth, but you breath the waters calmly, like a
thick vapor. "Learn." You search through the mass

02:37:46.547 --> 02:37:56.975
of shifting slick sea vines eventually coming upon
the base of a staircase going up. "Grow."

02:37:56.975 --> 02:38:01.346
What do you do?

02:38:02.415 --> 02:38:06.029
TRAVIS: I climb those motherfucking stairs.

02:38:06.909 --> 02:38:12.697
MATT: As you ascend the cold stone stairs, the
beam of the eye lighting the way, your passage is

02:38:12.697 --> 02:38:22.315
suddenly blocked by something. A statue; humanoid,
but featureless. "Provoke."

02:38:26.069 --> 02:38:31.554
TRAVIS: I'll fire two blasts of Eldritch Blast at
it.

02:38:31.554 --> 02:38:39.208
MATT: The statue breaks apart, its various shards
emerging from the detonation and slowly sinking in

02:38:39.208 --> 02:38:44.367
what is now the thick waters around you. As the
head tumbles past the light of the edge of your

02:38:44.367 --> 02:38:55.374
sword, the face is recognizable in a flash:
Sabian. You push beyond, continuing to ascend the

02:38:55.426 --> 02:39:04.795
stairs. You come upon another statue, larger and
looming more than the last. What do you do?

02:39:05.675 --> 02:39:08.717
TRAVIS: Witch Bolt, right to its chest.

02:39:08.717 --> 02:39:13.614
MATT: As the darkened energy arcs from the hilt of
your blade, hitting it you watch as the cracks

02:39:13.614 --> 02:39:25.624
spider up the stone before it detonates into
hundreds of shards of dark stone. You see half of

02:39:25.624 --> 02:39:37.689
the face slowly hit and clatter onto the stone
before falling off to the side. Vandren. Do you

02:39:37.689 --> 02:39:40.237
continue up?

02:39:43.184 --> 02:39:47.533
TRAVIS: The stairs, are they staying the same, is
there anything at the foot of the statue after

02:39:47.533 --> 02:39:49.902
they break apart?

02:39:49.902 --> 02:39:55.699
MATT: Looking down the statue itself is now
immaterial. You've entirely annihilated it and you

02:39:55.699 --> 02:40:00.451
glance over the side, and what few shards still
remain, slowly drift beyond your view into the

02:40:00.451 --> 02:40:02.112
dark abyss below.

02:40:02.112 --> 02:40:04.462
TRAVIS: I'll move forward.

02:40:04.462 --> 02:40:10.747
MATT: Continuing to ascend these steps one by one,
they grow more and more narrow. You think you see

02:40:10.747 --> 02:40:22.374
an approaching surface of some kind. You're clear
of the water, suddenly breaking the surface and

02:40:22.374 --> 02:40:29.031
you're standing in a dark stone chamber. You've
managed to get all the way up standing within the

02:40:29.031 --> 02:40:33.757
ankle high water in the middle of the stone
chamber and you watch, as all the liquid begins to

02:40:33.757 --> 02:40:44.308
drain. Until there's no more water around you.
Revealing in the center of this chamber, an

02:40:44.308 --> 02:40:50.814
intricate circle in the ground, maybe two feet
across. Beautiful ancient craftsmanship, detailed

02:40:50.814 --> 02:40:57.716
to depict a serpent body coiled. Carved eyes
emerging from the creature's body every few

02:40:57.716 --> 02:41:10.622
inches. The center of the water is a circle of
water, like a well. "Watching." What do you do?

02:41:13.580 --> 02:41:20.569
TRAVIS: I'll summon the sword and hold the eye
facing the circle.

02:41:20.569 --> 02:41:26.446
MATT: As you hold the blade up, you see the light
hits the water and is absorbed by it. You don't

02:41:26.446 --> 02:41:31.535
see anything beneath it. It seems to be just a
void that eats the light.

02:41:33.471 --> 02:41:39.715
TRAVIS: Void that eats the light. Can I walk into
the center of the circle?

02:41:39.715 --> 02:41:41.695
MATT: You step into it?

02:41:41.695 --> 02:41:45.506
TRAVIS: Well, I definitely do now.

02:41:45.506 --> 02:41:47.317
MATT: Well, is that what you want to do?

02:41:47.317 --> 02:41:48.226
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:41:48.226 --> 02:41:51.559
MATT: Okay, you step into the circle, it's only a
few inches deep of water and your feet feel the

02:41:51.559 --> 02:41:57.809
bottom. It is shallow. You're now standing above
it, it's only about two feet across, so it's

02:41:57.809 --> 02:42:03.024
basically you standing over the small pool.

02:42:03.843 --> 02:42:08.983
TRAVIS: Is there a ceiling, are there walls, are
there statues in this space?

02:42:08.983 --> 02:42:12.642
MATT: Looking around you, you can see stone walls
and you could see a ceiling above you. It is

02:42:12.642 --> 02:42:23.339
almost plain featureless room, aside from the very
edges of stone stacked upon itself.

02:42:23.339 --> 02:42:32.766
TRAVIS: Watching. Can I look into the eye of the
sword, do I see anything?

02:42:32.766 --> 02:42:36.873
MATT: You look towards the hilt and the eye stares
back at you. The light temporarily blinding you

02:42:36.873 --> 02:42:39.817
for a moment, as you adjust.

02:42:39.817 --> 02:42:49.553
TRAVIS: What the fuck? Can I try and take the edge
of the blade and press it into the floor?

02:42:49.553 --> 02:42:53.806
MATT: You press the blade in through the water and
it hits the stone.

02:42:54.609 --> 02:43:04.995
TRAVIS: Jesus. (English accent) I don't know what
you want from me!

02:43:05.583 --> 02:43:15.401
MATT: No response. Then you hear once more,
"Watch."

02:43:23.719 --> 02:43:41.664
TRAVIS: I've stared at the eye. Fuck. I have no
idea.

02:43:41.664 --> 02:43:48.000
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:50.665
TRAVIS: Ooh, 19.

02:43:50.665 --> 02:43:58.683
MATT: The handle of the sword is somewhat slick in
your grasp from the water you've been traveling

02:43:58.683 --> 02:44:07.108
from before and you feel the blade almost trying
to turn in your grasp, turning the eye away from you.

02:44:07.108 --> 02:44:11.579
TRAVIS: I'll let it go where it's leading and
point it towards the floor.

02:44:11.579 --> 02:44:16.211
MATT: It slowly finds its way resting facing down
towards the pool.

02:44:18.664 --> 02:44:20.402
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:44:20.402 --> 02:44:22.495
LAURA: Put your face in it.

02:44:22.883 --> 02:44:28.584
TRAVIS: Sure. Can I put my face in the water?

02:44:28.584 --> 02:44:32.070
[cheering]

02:44:32.070 --> 02:44:35.037
SAM: (pigeon cooing)

02:44:35.533 --> 02:44:40.911
MATT: You place your face down into the water, and
as opposed to the stone surface you've seen there,

02:44:40.911 --> 02:44:49.612
it is this vacuous black void. There, you see in a
sudden instant, the eye opens up before you, the

02:44:49.612 --> 02:44:53.808
bright yellow light enveloping you. Suddenly,
there's searing heat and you pull back out of the

02:44:53.808 --> 02:45:00.965
pool and the entire chamber is filled with blazing
hot steam. It hurts at first, but then, it begins

02:45:00.965 --> 02:45:08.226
to feel nice. This burning sensation crawling
across your body, going instead from pain to a

02:45:08.226 --> 02:45:26.286
surge of strength. Of control, of purpose. The
voice again says, "Reward." As you look up around

02:45:26.286 --> 02:45:31.186
you the stone falls away and on the distance you
can see that horizon once more. Now an endless

02:45:31.186 --> 02:45:38.233
ocean. You can see the faint ripples of waves
across a sourceless bit of moonlight. There you

02:45:38.233 --> 02:45:50.360
see dozens of ships coming towards you. What do
you do?

02:45:56.282 --> 02:45:59.228
TRAVIS: Can I look behind myself real fast?

02:45:59.228 --> 02:46:04.166
MATT: You turn behind you and it is just darkness.
Inky, infinite.

02:46:04.166 --> 02:46:15.953
TRAVIS: A shit load of ships coming towards me.
Cool. Are there any pigeons in this dream?

02:46:15.953 --> 02:46:21.026
(laughter)

02:46:21.026 --> 02:46:25.524
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:46:25.524 --> 02:46:27.717
TRAVIS: 16!

02:46:27.717 --> 02:46:30.375
MATT: No.

02:46:31.409 --> 02:46:38.880
TRAVIS: Can I reach my hand out and try and
control the ships?

02:46:38.880 --> 02:46:43.332
MATT: As you concentrate, looking towards the
right of you, where it looks like four or five

02:46:43.332 --> 02:46:49.155
vessels are in a localized portion of this black,
endless ocean. As you concentrate you see the

02:46:49.155 --> 02:46:52.712
water begin to boil beneath them.

02:46:54.137 --> 02:46:58.927
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're going to go ahead and grab
whatever the fuck that is and pull it up.

02:46:58.927 --> 02:47:06.031
MATT: You watch as the ocean fires up like a
spire, a pillar of solid ocean water. The ships

02:47:06.031 --> 02:47:11.329
are scattered in different directions, as it slams
them down once more, scattering them into

02:47:11.329 --> 02:47:14.524
thousands of pieces of splintered wood.

02:47:17.947 --> 02:47:24.684
TRAVIS: Can I take both hands and do a coup de
grace, two big (crashing) over the top?

02:47:24.684 --> 02:47:32.661
MATT: The center of the ocean parts, giving this
slight vacuum. This dual-sided, abyssal crevice in

02:47:32.661 --> 02:47:39.266
the center of the ocean. On the opposite ends of
where your hands rise, you watch the waves rise up

02:47:39.266 --> 02:47:47.307
and in one fell sweep, two solid crystalline walls
of water slam together and then even out. As the

02:47:47.307 --> 02:47:52.936
ripples subside, all you can see are the thousands
and thousands of glittering shards of what once

02:47:52.936 --> 02:47:54.570
were that armada.

02:47:54.570 --> 02:47:55.612
MARISHA: Moses shit.

02:47:55.612 --> 02:47:58.682
TRAVIS: Don't wake up, don't wake up.

02:47:59.909 --> 02:48:07.638
MATT: "Reward." And you wake up.

02:48:07.638 --> 02:48:21.563
[applause]

02:48:24.313 --> 02:48:29.407
SAM: Wow, another dream with seamen scattered
everywhere.

02:48:29.407 --> 02:48:36.221
[laughter]

02:48:36.221 --> 02:48:39.190
MATT: It's somehow worse with that outfit.

02:48:39.190 --> 02:48:42.846
TRAVIS: (laughing) Yes!

02:48:42.846 --> 02:48:45.563
SAM: That's my people.

02:48:49.250 --> 02:48:53.192
MATT: As the rest of you come to consciousness in
the morning, Fjord seems to be sleeping in a

02:48:53.192 --> 02:48:57.094
little bit before suddenly shooting up with a
gasp.

02:48:57.094 --> 02:49:00.749
LAURA: Did you have a dream?

02:49:00.749 --> 02:49:08.978
TRAVIS: (English accent) What? (regular voice) No,
no, I didn't.

02:49:09.871 --> 02:49:14.337
MARISHA: You're drenched in sweat. Just throwing
that out there.

02:49:14.337 --> 02:49:15.424
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:49:15.424 --> 02:49:17.601
MARISHA: Real soggy.

02:49:17.601 --> 02:49:26.393
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, we were fighting crazy beasts
and monsters and all this talk of serpents, I feel--

02:49:26.393 --> 02:49:32.228
LAURA: Fjord! Are you lying?

02:49:32.228 --> 02:49:35.667
MATT: Make an insight check. Make a deception
check.

02:49:35.667 --> 02:49:40.005
LIAM: Also, why did you talk so funny for a
moment?

02:49:40.005 --> 02:49:42.334
LAURA: Ah, come on!

02:49:42.334 --> 02:49:46.836
TRAVIS: 16.

02:49:46.836 --> 02:49:52.159
LAURA: I rolled a fucking one!

02:49:52.159 --> 02:50:00.360
MATT: I mean, he seems perturbed by something, but
you don't disbelieve him. Caduceus, however.

02:50:00.360 --> 02:50:05.029
[cheering]

02:50:05.029 --> 02:50:11.055
TALIESIN: I just woke up, I don't actually know
what's going on right now.

02:50:11.055 --> 02:50:19.703
MATT: Fair enough. Oh, but looking at passive
insight for Beauregard and Caleb.

02:50:19.703 --> 02:50:25.889
LIAM: You sounded like you had a different accent
for a moment there, Fjord.

02:50:25.889 --> 02:50:28.356
MARISHA: I'm not going to say anything.

02:50:28.356 --> 02:50:37.478
TRAVIS: I don't know. I'm so used to copying
people, I get all sorts of stuff mixed up in my head.

02:50:37.478 --> 02:50:40.075
MARISHA: Let's go.

02:50:40.075 --> 02:50:42.526
TALIESIN: Did I miss something, I don't--?

02:50:42.526 --> 02:50:44.930
ASHLEY: You sure you don't want to talk about it?

02:50:44.930 --> 02:50:47.730
TRAVIS: Talk about the dream?

02:50:47.730 --> 02:50:49.451
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:50:49.451 --> 02:50:53.508
TRAVIS: I mean, it's just a dream. What's there to
talk about?

02:50:53.508 --> 02:50:58.092
SAM: Nobody likes to hear other people's dreams.
It's really boring.

02:50:58.092 --> 02:51:02.658
TRAVIS: First thing in the morning, you're like, (sarcasm)
"Oh, I know, it was amazing. Tell me more. "

02:51:02.658 --> 02:51:04.455
SAM: Yeah, that's true.

02:51:04.517 --> 02:51:13.591
[laughter]

02:51:13.591 --> 02:51:17.922
TRAVIS: I mean, wait, you guys didn't have any
dreams of a similar nature, did you?

02:51:17.922 --> 02:51:19.569
MARISHA: No, we didn't.

02:51:19.569 --> 02:51:22.024
TALIESIN: What kind of dreams of a similar
nature?

02:51:22.024 --> 02:51:27.738
LAURA: I had this dream that I was walking in this
field and then there was this banana tree right in

02:51:27.738 --> 02:51:33.001
front of me and I climbed it and I got some
bananas and then they turned bad really fast.

02:51:33.001 --> 02:51:34.070
SAM: Ooh!

02:51:34.070 --> 02:51:35.351
LAURA: Yeah, so I think it had something to do
with that.

02:51:35.351 --> 02:51:36.183
SAM: Yeah.

02:51:36.183 --> 02:51:43.137
LAURA: Then the grass was purple, and then this
guy came up to me and he was like, "Whoa, I just

02:51:43.137 --> 02:51:49.429
"heard--" but then his face turned into an eagle
and he flew away. What do you think it means?

02:51:50.953 --> 02:51:55.435
SAM: You should write those down, they're really
important.

02:51:55.435 --> 02:51:57.344
LAURA: Okay.

02:51:57.344 --> 02:52:08.734
MARISHA: Look, as someone who still doesn't have
any type of dreams, whatever's going on, it's not

02:52:08.734 --> 02:52:11.593
normal, I just want to point that out.

02:52:11.593 --> 02:52:20.120
SAM: She just wants you to know that you're not
normal. Should we go off to our adventure now?

02:52:20.120 --> 02:52:22.155
MATT: You guys head your way up to the deck.

02:52:22.155 --> 02:52:26.532
LIAM: Except that I pull Beau back while everyone
proceeds upstairs.

02:52:26.532 --> 02:52:28.484
MATT: All right.

02:52:28.484 --> 02:52:34.970
[laughter]

02:52:34.970 --> 02:52:48.034
LIAM: Speaking as a massive liar, I think he is
lying to us a little bit.

02:52:48.034 --> 02:52:55.515
MARISHA: Look, we can know, just like I know about
your shit, we can know about Fjord's shit, and we

02:52:55.515 --> 02:52:59.920
can just keep that on the down low, right? I'm
interested in knowing about people's shit, not

02:52:59.920 --> 02:53:01.928
exposing it.

02:53:01.928 --> 02:53:05.603
LIAM: Sure. One eye open.

02:53:05.603 --> 02:53:07.200
MARISHA: One eye open.

02:53:07.200 --> 02:53:10.672
LIAM: I don't think he knows what he wants yet.

02:53:10.672 --> 02:53:18.084
MARISHA: Oh, and you think you do? You the
authority on knowing what other people want?

02:53:18.084 --> 02:53:21.650
LIAM: No, I'm the authority on knowing what I
want, Beauregard.

02:53:21.650 --> 02:53:24.476
MARISHA: Yeah. Me neither.

02:53:27.192 --> 02:53:33.063
[laughter]

02:53:34.786 --> 02:53:38.228
LIAM: He spoke with a different accent for a split
second.

02:53:38.228 --> 02:53:40.541
MARISHA: We've heard Fjord speak with a lot of
different accents.

02:53:40.541 --> 02:53:43.386
LIAM: Yeah, to a purpose, not when he is waking up
instantly.

02:53:43.386 --> 02:53:47.673
MARISHA: He clearly had some sort of fucking
dream. We know that.

02:53:47.673 --> 02:53:49.611
LIAM: Okay.

02:53:49.611 --> 02:53:54.021
MARISHA: He'll tell us when he wants to tell us,
all right?

02:53:54.021 --> 02:53:56.005
LIAM: I walk upstairs.

02:53:56.005 --> 02:54:01.173
MATT: Okay, you guys have made it to the deck.
It's early morning. The sun's only really been up

02:54:01.173 --> 02:54:05.596
maybe an hour or so. There's still a mist across
the ocean and you can see the distance where the

02:54:05.596 --> 02:54:10.347
reefs encapsulate the surrounding area of this
island. The mist is so heavy that you cannot see

02:54:10.347 --> 02:54:15.787
beyond other than a few other signs that you
recall when you first passed through that reef.

02:54:15.787 --> 02:54:21.376
Looking off the way of the shore, you can see that
The Mistake is currently grounded and looks like

02:54:21.376 --> 02:54:25.529
there's a small crew trying to do repairs. You're
not quite sure to what extent and how long it'll

02:54:25.529 --> 02:54:29.519
take, but the ship seems to be at least the time
being out of commission.

02:54:30.731 --> 02:54:40.665
TALIESIN: Hopefully we can fix our Mistake at some
point. That'd be nice. Thank you, sorry, carry on.

02:54:41.245 --> 02:54:47.159
MATT: You can see Vera, Captain Avantika and a few
of the crew members are currently in a

02:54:47.159 --> 02:54:54.030
conversation with a man that you hadn't seen
before. You see a gentleman completely bald head,

02:54:54.030 --> 02:55:02.262
very dark brown skin. A heavy leather coat with
like a few belts or bandoliers attached to it. He

02:55:02.262 --> 02:55:07.213
has a satchel on the side and a few blades that
are sheathed and hanging. He looks like an

02:55:07.213 --> 02:55:15.731
individual who's ready to travel. In case anything
happens, he's prepared. Maybe a little cleaner

02:55:15.731 --> 02:55:19.618
than Caleb, but definitely a little ramshackle in
appearance. They're in the middle of a

02:55:19.618 --> 02:55:24.014
conversation and as soon as you approach the deck,
the Captain notices your presence and goes, "Good

02:55:24.014 --> 02:55:31.726
"morning! Come, it seems that our destined journey
is just around the corner. Please, The Mighty

02:55:31.726 --> 02:55:39.064
"Nein, may I introduce you to a good friend who is
hoping to be arrived soon, Jamedi. Jamedi, this is

02:55:39.064 --> 02:55:46.110
"The Mighty Nein." He turns to you all and goes, "It
is a pleasure to meet you all. The Captain has

02:55:46.110 --> 02:55:50.225
"told me that we are to be traveling to the island
together, yes?"

02:55:50.225 --> 02:55:52.564
LAURA: Oui.

02:55:52.564 --> 02:55:54.808
TALIESIN: We.

02:55:54.808 --> 02:55:58.316
TRAVIS: That is correct. It is a pleasure to meet
you as well.

02:55:58.316 --> 02:56:05.488
MATT: "I will tell you it is very dangerous. Bring
what you think is necessary. The island itself is

02:56:05.488 --> 02:56:08.580
"indeed cursed for the creatures that call it
home."

02:56:08.580 --> 02:56:13.576
MARISHA: Well, if you've explored it, why don't
you tell us what's necessary to bring?

02:56:13.576 --> 02:56:17.863
MATT: "I was about to give you that before you so
rudely interrupted me first thing in the morning."

02:56:17.863 --> 02:56:23.497
MARISHA: Okay, well, then go on. What?

02:56:25.946 --> 02:56:32.704
MATT: He gives like a look to the Captain, the
Captain's like. "There are a number of lizard folk

02:56:32.704 --> 02:56:39.695
"that patrol the outskirts of the island calling it
home, hunting. I could not quite suss out the

02:56:39.695 --> 02:56:45.934
"source of where their society is, but they seem to
live on the exterior of the island. Further in, I

02:56:45.934 --> 02:56:54.147
"did find the temple, but it is not abandoned.
There are villages of snake men that surround this

02:56:54.147 --> 02:57:01.939
"stone shrine. Their mutations are various and
strange. I managed to avoid being seen and I made

02:57:01.939 --> 02:57:11.351
"it to the initial interior chambers of this
village, of this stone obelisk of a temple, but I

02:57:11.351 --> 02:57:18.456
"surmised it would be best if I went further with
aid of those who were capable of defending

02:57:18.456 --> 02:57:26.264
"themselves. So I came back. I do have a path that
I think is of, how you say, least resistance, so I

02:57:26.264 --> 02:57:33.671
"would say bring what is important to perhaps deal
with lizards and snakes."

02:57:33.671 --> 02:57:36.358
LAURA: These lizard and snake people.

02:57:36.358 --> 02:57:37.258
MATT: "Yes?"

02:57:37.258 --> 02:57:40.138
LAURA: Did they seem nice?

02:57:40.138 --> 02:57:43.634
MATT: "No."

02:57:43.634 --> 02:57:49.055
LAURA: Did you see any snake and lizard women and
children?

02:57:49.927 --> 02:57:58.942
MATT: "There were various of both sexes and perhaps
between. I do not know the full idea of these

02:57:58.942 --> 02:58:01.940
"creatures' physiology."

02:58:01.940 --> 02:58:03.815
LAURA: All right.

02:58:03.815 --> 02:58:07.660
SAM: That's all you wanted to know, just--

02:58:07.660 --> 02:58:11.444
LAURA: I just wanted to know if they had happy
families, that's all, you know.

02:58:11.444 --> 02:58:13.035
TALIESIN: Did they have feet or--?

02:58:13.035 --> 02:58:15.713
MATT: "I did not look too closely into the--"

02:58:15.713 --> 02:58:18.897
LAURA: But what do they do for fun?

02:58:18.897 --> 02:58:24.497
SAM: Jester, we're probably going to kill all of
these people. Maybe we don't care what they do.

02:58:24.497 --> 02:58:31.463
MATT: "I would not suggest trying to kill them
all. Trying to avoid them, expediency, using the

02:58:31.463 --> 02:58:36.327
"shadows, and travel without being found I think is
our best bet at survival."

02:58:36.327 --> 02:58:42.761
TRAVIS: I would agree. I think they're quite
territorial. We would do best to remain unseen.

02:58:42.761 --> 02:58:45.642
LAURA: Have you run into these people before,
Fjord?

02:58:45.642 --> 02:58:46.729
TRAVIS: No, I haven't, I'm--

02:58:46.729 --> 02:58:50.466
MARISHA: Hmm!

02:58:50.466 --> 02:58:53.785
LAURA: Have you had dreams about them or
something?

02:58:53.785 --> 02:58:57.034
TRAVIS: No, what was your comment?

02:58:57.034 --> 02:59:04.342
MARISHA: Is this not ringing a bell for any of
y'all's? Snake people, temples, the naga. We

02:59:04.342 --> 02:59:08.519
already fought them. Done this once before. Think
that's where we got the little sphere thing that

02:59:08.573 --> 02:59:14.429
went in Fjord's thing, had a little circle with
like a pool in it and you could see shit?

02:59:14.429 --> 02:59:18.683
TRAVIS: They were like fish people, not like snake
people.

02:59:18.683 --> 02:59:20.011
TALIESIN: I don't remember any of this.

02:59:20.011 --> 02:59:20.968
LAURA: Yeah they were like--

02:59:20.968 --> 02:59:31.830
(laughter)

02:59:31.830 --> 02:59:35.021
MARISHA: All right, but hear me out. Because we
fought those people in the swamp, they were the

02:59:35.021 --> 02:59:41.129
merrow people, right? Maybe they're still
worshiping the same type of serpentine deity.

02:59:41.129 --> 02:59:42.662
TRAVIS: I see where you're going.

02:59:42.662 --> 02:59:45.314
MARISHA: A lot of different people takes a lot of
different types.

02:59:45.314 --> 02:59:51.532
LAURA: What if we were already in one of the
temples that we're looking for? You said there

02:59:51.532 --> 02:59:53.257
were three, right?

02:59:53.257 --> 02:59:54.442
MARISHA: That's what I just said.

02:59:54.442 --> 02:59:55.829
LAURA: What if that was a temple, right?

02:59:55.829 --> 02:59:56.638
MARISHA: Yeah!

02:59:56.638 --> 02:59:58.041
LAURA: That's what you were going for.

02:59:58.041 --> 02:59:59.134
MARISHA: That's what I was totally going for.

02:59:59.134 --> 02:59:59.968
LAURA: I understand.

02:59:59.968 --> 03:00:01.530
MARISHA: Thank you.

03:00:01.530 --> 03:00:05.294
TALIESIN: I thought it was like metaphorical that
we were still in the temple and just having some

03:00:05.294 --> 03:00:12.043
elaborate, like a dream of life and we've all been
in this temple all along and, I mean, that would

03:00:12.043 --> 03:00:18.745
have been really cool, although really convoluted
the more I'm thinking about it. Doesn't make any sense.

03:00:18.745 --> 03:00:24.524
SAM: Before we go stealthing in, Fjord, do you
want to look at the dodecahedron or anything?

03:00:24.524 --> 03:00:25.988
Would that be good?

03:00:25.988 --> 03:00:26.632
TRAVIS: Me?

03:00:26.632 --> 03:00:27.779
SAM: Yeah, you, you're the--

03:00:27.779 --> 03:00:30.437
MATT: The Captain goes, "What is a dodecahedron?"

03:00:30.437 --> 03:00:40.973
TRAVIS: It is a sigil of our group that is
sometimes viewed just to focus one's energy.

03:00:40.973 --> 03:00:42.183
SAM: Like a pep talk.

03:00:42.183 --> 03:00:45.938
TRAVIS: But I don't think I need it. I'm very
focused on the fucking job at hand and perhaps

03:00:45.938 --> 03:00:51.178
someone needs help with like stealth, you know?

03:00:51.178 --> 03:00:52.945
SAM: Not me.

03:00:54.069 --> 03:00:56.805
TRAVIS: Oh, plus zero. All right, I'll look at
it.

03:00:56.805 --> 03:01:03.571
[applause]

03:01:03.571 --> 03:01:07.043
TRAVIS: Should have looked at that first.

03:01:07.043 --> 03:01:13.189
MATT: The Captain claps her hands twice again, to
get everyone's attention. "Vera, look after the

03:01:13.189 --> 03:01:22.981
"ship. Look after our men, their men. Jamedi, lead
the way. I am excited to see what we uncover

03:01:22.981 --> 03:01:25.069
"together, huh?"

03:01:25.069 --> 03:01:26.104
TRAVIS: Indeed.

03:01:26.104 --> 03:01:36.870
MATT: "I hope you slept well. Come. To the boats."
The rope ladders are let over once more. You all

03:01:36.870 --> 03:01:44.868
descend into these row boats. Between the two of
them, most of you can get onto it, a little

03:01:44.868 --> 03:01:49.856
awkwardly, but enough to at least make your way
the few hundred feet to the shore. You eventually

03:01:49.856 --> 03:01:59.043
come upon the beautiful, white beaches of Urukaxl.
You see the occasional shard of driftwood or a

03:01:59.043 --> 03:02:05.380
glimmer of a smooth abalone shell scattered
amongst the sandy beach. The jungle line begins

03:02:05.380 --> 03:02:10.544

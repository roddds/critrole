00:00:01.226 --> 00:00:07.090
MATT: (laughter) God damn it! Welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.565
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:09.565 --> 00:00:12.601
(howling)

00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:15.736
MATT: We are unfortunately down one Laura Bailey
tonight because she got the con plague from

00:00:15.736 --> 00:00:20.378
Chicago, and she needs a little baby to take care
of, so she's going to be at home, watching and

00:00:20.378 --> 00:00:23.205
texting these guys if they do anything really
wrong with Jester.

00:00:23.205 --> 00:00:24.219
ASHLEY: Please, just come.

00:00:24.219 --> 00:00:26.488
LIAM: We almost had three women at this table.

00:00:26.488 --> 00:00:34.072
MATT: Almost. But we have Ashley back. Back back
for a while now. So happy you've returned.

00:00:34.072 --> 00:00:34.832
ASHLEY: Me too.

00:00:36.222 --> 00:00:39.302
MATT: Before we jump into the game, we have some
announcements to get to tonight. First and

00:00:39.302 --> 00:00:44.756
foremost, we have our sponsor tonight, D&amp;D Beyond.
Sam, if you want to take it from here.

00:00:44.756 --> 00:00:50.100
SAM: Okay. Let's see if we can do this. Good luck.
You know, the best part about D&amp;D Beyond is

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.073
keeping track of your important stuff. And there's
one important thing we keep losing: Ashley

00:00:56.073 --> 00:01:01.544
Johnson. Please put this on. So I'm proud to give
you the first ever D&amp;D Beyond Presents: The Mighty

00:01:01.544 --> 00:01:12.885
Nein Welcome Back Yasha Ceremony, featuring Ashley
Johnson, everybody. Maestro, hit it. Oh, there's

00:01:12.885 --> 00:01:18.390
the award show music. I'm your host, D&amp;D Beyond
presents Sam Riegel, and we're going to go around

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:25.751
the room super fast to honor Ashley's triumphant
return. Didn't work. First up is Travis. None of

00:01:25.751 --> 00:01:30.648
them work. First up is Travis with a toast.

00:01:30.648 --> 00:01:35.748
TRAVIS: When I drink to you, Ashley, my heart is
as full as my glass.

00:01:35.748 --> 00:01:42.553
SAM: That's enough! There's no time! We got to
keep going! I can't do it! Do it for me! Now we're

00:01:42.553 --> 00:01:44.149
going to go to Taliesin with a song.

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.102
TALIESIN: (singing) Should auld acquaintance be
forgot, and--

00:01:48.102 --> 00:01:51.600
SAM: That's enough! Marisha has a poem prepared!

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.944
MARISHA: Welcome back, Ashley, good friend of
mine, goodbye Blindspot, hello Nein!

00:01:55.944 --> 00:02:00.332
(cheering)

00:02:00.332 --> 00:02:03.474
SAM: And finally, Liam prepared an old Irish
blessing!

00:02:03.474 --> 00:02:08.665
LIAM: (Irish accent) Oh may the road rise up to
meet you. May the wind be always at your back. May

00:02:08.665 --> 00:02:10.511
the sun shine warm upon your face--

00:02:10.511 --> 00:02:16.049
SAM: Okay, that's enough, we don't have time.
Ashley, you are a good and creative person, and

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:25.559
D&amp;D Beyond wants you to honor the good-- D&amp;D
Beyond wants to honor the goodness and creativity

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:31.529
of the fine folks at 826LA by kicking off the
826LA charity push.

00:02:31.529 --> 00:02:34.433
(cheering)

00:02:34.433 --> 00:02:40.419
SAM: For every nat one rolled by us, D&amp;D Beyond
will be donating a hundred dollars-- Is that

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:49.205
true?-- to 826LA! Also, D&amp;D Beyond is
retroactively donating for all the nat ones we've

00:02:49.205 --> 00:02:51.261
rolled so far in this campaign!

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:52.187
LIAM: So many!

00:02:53.707 --> 00:02:59.523
SAM: That's like 4200 bucks! But there's
more. Once we hit the 10,000 dollar donation tier

00:02:59.523 --> 00:03:04.259
level-- I don't really understand this part--
Critters will unlock a special discount code for

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:06.480
the legendary bundle on D&amp;D Beyond!

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.872
(cheering)

00:03:08.872 --> 00:03:12.077
(laughter)

00:03:12.077 --> 00:03:13.189
TRAVIS: It's totally not toxic.

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:15.001
LIAM: It's in my drink!

00:03:16.751 --> 00:03:24.604
SAM: Was this all planned for Ashley's return? No!
This was planned far before! But hey, it sure

00:03:24.604 --> 00:03:30.501
feels like it. So from all of us at the table, and
the guys at D&amp;D Beyond: Welcome back, Ashley.

00:03:30.501 --> 00:03:34.916
(cheering)

00:03:35.746 --> 00:03:37.421
ASHLEY: D&amp;D Beyond!

00:03:38.501 --> 00:03:39.764
TRAVIS: 826LA!

00:03:42.714 --> 00:03:47.657
MATT: Everyone at Wyrmwood watching just cringed
as we showered the table.

00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:55.439
MARISHA: Here, Ashley, I'm going to tie it to your
chair like we're at Applebee's.

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:57.569
LIAM: Low, don't let them set the lights on fire.

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:02.895
SAM: Oh, I forgot to give you your award of
excellence. It's from Jurassic World.

00:04:05.235 --> 00:04:09.420
ASHLEY: Yes! Oh, guys, come on, this is the best!

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.675
LIAM: My Wyrmwood has never looked so festive.

00:04:12.675 --> 00:04:16.137
TALIESIN: This is the most festive D&amp;D game I've
ever experienced.

00:04:16.137 --> 00:04:18.869
LIAM: I didn't shoot my silly string, because it's
hair spray.

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:21.444
TALIESIN: You were supposed to have a lighter
too.

00:04:23.224 --> 00:04:24.553
SAM: Wait, it's hairspray?

00:04:24.553 --> 00:04:25.515
TRAVIS: Yes it is.

00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:30.084
TALIESIN: I didn't even look at mine! That could
have gone so poorly!

00:04:30.084 --> 00:04:33.360
SAM: I think I bought the wrong thing at the
store!

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.600
MATT: We almost had an actual Burning Hands
example on script. Thank you, D&amp;D Beyond, for

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.958
helping with our wonderful push for 826. We'll
have a video at the break today to show and

00:04:46.958 --> 00:04:51.692
explain some of the stuff involved with this whole
charity push for 826, so look for that at the break.

00:04:52.482 --> 00:04:54.268
ASHLEY: Oh man, I love you guys.

00:04:54.268 --> 00:04:57.503
MARISHA: So go pee, but watch it at the break,
it's really important.

00:04:57.503 --> 00:05:02.069
MATT: A couple of things some of you may have
noticed, but if you haven't--we have a fantastic

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:08.811
partnership with Obsidian for the upcoming Pillars
of Eternity II: Deadfire, where number one the

00:05:08.811 --> 00:05:13.390
cast of Critical Role have been cast throughout
the game as a number of the main characters in the

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.678
story. I'm returning as mine and we have everyone
else joining the awesome personalities all

00:05:17.678 --> 00:05:23.739
throughout Deadfire and on top of that you will
have free DLC unlocked for custom voice sets and

00:05:23.739 --> 00:05:28.352
character portraits of Vox Machina, including
Gilmore, available to use in the game.

00:05:28.352 --> 00:05:30.961
(cheering)

00:05:31.433 --> 00:05:32.366
TRAVIS: First time ever.

00:05:32.366 --> 00:05:34.255
SAM: Who's voicing Gilmore?

00:05:34.255 --> 00:05:40.870
MATT: I think Max is voicing-- No, I'm voicing
Gilmore. We're super excited, they look amazing,

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.104
and we're excited for you guys to check it out.
You can go ahead and pre-order now at

00:05:45.588 --> 00:05:51.538
versusevil.com/criticalrole to pre-order the game
if you want to check it out. I love the series and

00:05:51.538 --> 00:05:55.274
I'm super excited for the sequel, completely
unbiased and then biased--hell yeah.

00:05:55.274 --> 00:06:00.225
LIAM: Recording Vox Machina and Gilmore lines was
sur-real!

00:06:00.225 --> 00:06:01.793
MATT: That was the most surreal thing.

00:06:02.193 --> 00:06:02.873
LIAM: It was so good!

00:06:02.873 --> 00:06:03.683
MATT: So crazy.

00:06:03.683 --> 00:06:06.721
LIAM: Travis's might have been my favorite. It was
fun.

00:06:06.721 --> 00:06:13.812
MATT: All right, 826LA did you make it all through
everything there?

00:06:13.812 --> 00:06:17.962
SAM: I did! It was kind of chaotic, but they're
donating for natural ones, they are retroactively

00:06:17.962 --> 00:06:20.428
donating for natural ones.

00:06:20.428 --> 00:06:23.263
MATT: Did you get to the matching the dollar
amount?

00:06:23.263 --> 00:06:27.410
SAM: Oh no! Is that the 10k thing? I was confused.

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:33.610
MATT: We do have a video at the break, but we have
a fantastic critter who is going to be matching

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:43.942
every dollar donated to the charity as well up to
40K. Great stuff! Twitch Prime: if you have an

ALL: <i>Nein!</i>

00:07:08.804 --> 00:07:09.947
SAM: Spend ten, get nine.

00:07:09.947 --> 00:07:16.490
ASHLEY: I have a Pike one, because we haven't
established what Yasha's thing is yet.

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.272
TALIESIN: It's hard to show off eyeliner.

00:07:18.272 --> 00:07:21.811
LIAM: A sliced-up corpse victim, maybe?

00:07:21.811 --> 00:07:24.314
SAM: She's the absence of emoji.

00:07:24.314 --> 00:07:26.163
ASHLEY: We'll figure out who she is together.

00:07:26.163 --> 00:07:33.869
MATT: Also if you need a refresher for campaign
two, Critical Recap. The first 13 episodes of our

00:07:33.869 --> 00:07:38.710

week's episode is also for download where all fine
podcasts (laughs) are available.

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:12.124
(laughter)

00:08:12.124 --> 00:08:12.966
TRAVIS: I'm not moving it.

00:08:12.966 --> 00:08:14.507
MATT: We've made a huge mistake.

00:08:14.507 --> 00:08:15.514
TRAVIS: I'm not touching it.

00:08:15.514 --> 00:08:20.107
(laughter)

00:08:20.107 --> 00:08:22.979
MATT: Available where all fine podcasts are
downloadable to get caught up in the campaign

00:08:22.979 --> 00:08:29.570

six-run Vox Machina: Origins series is going to be

00:08:37.931 --> 00:08:43.768
and many other places. Check it out, and I hope
you enjoy the finale of this six issue run. I

00:08:43.768 --> 00:08:49.419
think that's enough! We've talked about enough
there. With that being said, folks, let's go ahead

00:08:49.419 --> 00:08:57.470
and dive into tonight's episode of Critical Role!
Goddamn it!

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:02.024
[click, TV static]

00:09:02.024 --> 00:10:12.574
[groovy Critical Role theme]

00:10:19.736 --> 00:10:27.837
MATT: And welcome back. Last we left off, the
Mighty Nein had gotten caught up with some

00:10:27.837 --> 00:10:32.998
interesting folks, the Knights of Requital, who
had hoped to help shift the political balance in

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:44.340
the city, remove the framing and forging of
equipment, of materials and letters, some of the

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:48.254
corrupt individuals of the local government. They had
gone out into the evening, infiltrated a few of

00:10:48.254 --> 00:10:53.214
the homes and left this information behind, gotten
in a few scuffles, leaving one of them, the

00:10:53.214 --> 00:10:58.011
High-Richter, dead, and shortly after there was an
attack on the Tri-Spire. What are you looking at,

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:00.079
Sam? God damn it.

00:11:00.079 --> 00:11:02.447
LIAM: That's it! You're in the clear.

00:11:02.447 --> 00:11:12.804
MATT: I'll remember this (laughs). Noticing there
was seemingly an attack upon the Tri-Spire by two

00:11:12.804 --> 00:11:19.324
Xhorhasian assassin-type individuals, you met with
one in the sewer trying to escape from being seen

00:11:19.324 --> 00:11:26.878
by the local guard during this confrontation and
did battle with a Crick warrior of some kind. You

00:11:26.878 --> 00:11:32.021
subdued it, removed most of its equipment, and
conflicted over this strange artifact, this beacon

00:11:32.021 --> 00:11:36.917
that it was carrying, sent it on its way; however,
it was quickly caught by the guard and killed. You

00:11:36.917 --> 00:11:41.976
met, on the surface, the guard that were bringing
the corpse and the object along, managed to spirit

00:11:41.976 --> 00:11:49.287
away the strange dodecahedron from the grasp of
the town guard and absconded with it. You met with

00:11:49.287 --> 00:11:53.728
Dolan and Horris who're currently trying to figure
out what to do in case they were somehow

00:11:53.728 --> 00:11:57.851
implicated with the events of the evening. You
took Horris under your wing, promising Dolan that

00:11:57.851 --> 00:12:00.707
you would somehow smuggle him out of the city as
it's currently on lockdown during this

00:12:00.707 --> 00:12:07.847
investigation. You all then managed to try and
find some sort of lead on what the next step would

00:12:07.847 --> 00:12:13.690
be, went toward the Evening Nip apparently to seek
possibly this individual known as The Gentlemen of

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:17.439
which you have heard of previously as Kara, one of
the members of the Knights of Requital, who had

00:12:17.439 --> 00:12:24.724
vanished seemingly had some sort of connection
there. So you entered the Evening Nip, the rather

00:12:24.724 --> 00:12:33.580
dark and strange interior of the small dive bar,
gave the previously discovered words, the code

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:38.187
words that allowed you entry and were led down a
long spiral staircase beneath the establishment

00:12:38.187 --> 00:12:43.717
into a subterranean bar. Upon which, after
immediately stepping into the space, a

00:12:43.717 --> 00:12:50.384
black-furred female tabaxi approached Mollymauk
over here and with a look of recognition said,

00:12:50.384 --> 00:12:55.436
"Lucien," and then embraced you. And that's where
we left off.

00:12:55.436 --> 00:12:58.148
TRAVIS: (shouting) Fucking insight check on
Taliesin! No, I'm kidding.

00:12:58.148 --> 00:13:05.534
MATT: So as you guys all watch this dark-furred
tabaxi giving this big, strong hug around

00:13:05.534 --> 00:13:12.837
Mollymauk's shoulders. Pulls away and looks at you
and goes, "It has been too long, two ye--"

00:13:12.837 --> 00:13:14.034
TALIESIN: Far too long!

00:13:14.034 --> 00:13:17.738
MATT: "Two years! (laughs) Look at you! You
grew out your hair!"

00:13:17.751 --> 00:13:20.182
TALIESIN: Ah yes, it's been quite an interesting
two years.

00:13:20.182 --> 00:13:22.456
MATT: "And you are covered in tattoos!"

00:13:22.456 --> 00:13:26.995
TALIESIN: We'll catch up, we need a table, we need
drinks for me and my compatriots.

00:13:26.995 --> 00:13:30.903
MATT: "Of course, you-- these are your friends
now?"

00:13:30.903 --> 00:13:35.327
TALIESIN: It's a long story and I can't tell you
everything right now. You know how it is.

00:13:35.327 --> 00:13:46.596
MATT: "Very well." As the tabaxi turns around, you
can see there is posted right off to the right and

00:13:46.596 --> 00:13:51.629
around the corner a hulking figure that has leaned
around the edge that leads into this L-shaped

00:13:51.665 --> 00:14:00.364
tavern. A hefty, muscular ogre that is wearing
patchwork hide armor and holding a giant maul

00:14:00.364 --> 00:14:05.941
resting on the ground, looks back around the
corner with these beady, dark eyes and large,

00:14:05.941 --> 00:14:14.196
looming jaw with angry broken teeth protruding
from underneath going (snorts). Looks at the rest

00:14:14.196 --> 00:14:18.434
of you. Other folks around are looking a bit
confused at your entry. Right immediately to your

00:14:18.434 --> 00:14:22.699
left is a table with a rough-and-tumble looking
cutthroat sitting there eating a sandwich with a

00:14:22.699 --> 00:14:30.433
half-drunken drink, who's chewing slowly with this
glare of mistrust in your direction. There are two

00:14:30.519 --> 00:14:36.593
balconies up above you in the chamber. You now get
a better look up at the top, there are a number of

00:14:36.593 --> 00:14:40.928
individuals posted and some of them appear to be
drinking, but there is at least one of them

00:14:40.928 --> 00:14:45.469
immediately in your view who has two skulking
looking individuals with long dark cloaks and dark

00:14:45.469 --> 00:14:52.025
armor, carrying what looks almost like a heavy
crossbow, but it's a long, metal rod. You've only seen

00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:57.360
them in use here and there, but these are some
sort of a rifle-like firearm that are usually

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:03.393
reserved for the armies and Bladegarden and to the
far east of Xhorhas. A recently emerging

00:15:03.441 --> 00:15:08.305
technology that has been largely guarded within
use of the empire itself.

00:15:08.305 --> 00:15:11.398
TALIESIN: Literally everything coming back to
haunt me. Okay, cool.

00:15:11.398 --> 00:15:14.581
TRAVIS: If we had to ballpark it, how many persons
would you say are in this?

00:15:14.581 --> 00:15:21.501
MATT: 13 or so people in this tavern,
including the bartender, the individual who rushed

00:15:21.545 --> 00:15:25.933
to you as you entered, and various patrons around
that you can get a quick bead on.

00:15:25.981 --> 00:15:32.290
TALIESIN: The second she turns, I'm going to turn
and give Fjord a little pat on the back and make a

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:33.638
whisper really quickly.

00:15:33.638 --> 00:15:34.629
MATT: Okay.

00:15:34.629 --> 00:15:35.553
SAM: Make a whisper?

00:15:35.553 --> 00:15:38.633
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm gonna whisper in Fjord's ear--
I'm sorry, this is my nightmare, please just go

00:15:38.633 --> 00:15:42.264
with it? It's Lucien. And I'm back around. Pass it
on.

00:15:42.264 --> 00:15:45.273
MATT: Okay, which as soon as you say that, you
back away and look right behind Fjord as you all

00:15:45.335 --> 00:15:47.678
are standing there. There's Yasha.

00:15:47.678 --> 00:15:49.132
SAM: Oh, what?

00:15:49.132 --> 00:15:50.620
TALIESIN: (nervous laugh)

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:52.067
SAM: Just at the bar?

00:15:52.067 --> 00:15:54.709
MATT: No, right behind you as if she had just come
down the stairs with you.

00:15:54.709 --> 00:15:55.780
SAM: What?

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:56.573
TALIESIN: Yasha!

00:15:56.573 --> 00:15:57.566
SAM: (shrieks)

00:15:57.566 --> 00:15:59.076
ASHLEY: Hey! So?

00:15:59.076 --> 00:16:06.116
TALIESIN: I'm apparently Lucien from two years
ago. From two years ago. It's Lucien, remember?

00:16:06.116 --> 00:16:07.463
It's been ages!

00:16:07.463 --> 00:16:14.999
ASHLEY: Okay, it's been a minute. Hey, you guys
walked right past me in the bar upstairs so I

00:16:14.999 --> 00:16:15.953
decided to--

00:16:15.953 --> 00:16:17.081
LIAM: You are like a bad penny.

00:16:17.081 --> 00:16:21.682
SAM: We did not walk right past you! We looked
around! You're big, we would have seen you!

00:16:21.682 --> 00:16:24.933
ASHLEY: I've been right behind you the whole time,
I don't know how you didn't know I was here.

00:16:24.933 --> 00:16:26.584
TALIESIN: I'm so glad to see you.

00:16:26.584 --> 00:16:28.041
ASHLEY: I'm glad to see you too, Mollymauk.

00:16:28.041 --> 00:16:30.848
TALIESIN: It's Lucien. It's Lucien.

00:16:30.848 --> 00:16:32.279
ASHLEY: It's Lucien!

00:16:32.279 --> 00:16:35.224
LIAM: There's nothing private about our situation
at all, right? There's people everywhere?

00:16:35.224 --> 00:16:39.314
MATT: Well, there's people all throughout the
tavern, but there's some music playing. There's

00:16:39.314 --> 00:16:46.192
two musicians that are in the process of plucking
away at two instruments. Everyone seems further in

00:16:46.192 --> 00:16:50.303
the chamber, rather absorbed in their current
rigmarole, but you guys have just stepped down the

00:16:50.303 --> 00:16:53.453
stairs. You haven't left the stairs. You are
literally standing right at the entrance of this

00:16:53.453 --> 00:16:58.801
tavern and you've all been taken aback by that
encounter, the realization that Yasha had followed

00:16:58.801 --> 00:17:02.494
you down the stairs, and whatever is about to
transpire.

00:17:02.494 --> 00:17:03.962
TALIESIN: I'll explain later, just go with it
please?

00:17:03.962 --> 00:17:06.120
MARISHA: Oh, Yasha followed us, she wasn't
starting down here.

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:07.062
MATT: No.

00:17:07.062 --> 00:17:08.106
MARISHA: Gotcha.

00:17:08.106 --> 00:17:12.355
TRAVIS: I don't mind rolling with this name
Lucien, but does it bring any extra trouble with it?

00:17:12.355 --> 00:17:13.705
TALIESIN: I don't know. We'll find out.

00:17:13.705 --> 00:17:14.812
TRAVIS: Fair enough.

00:17:14.812 --> 00:17:16.050
TALIESIN: Just go with it, I'll explain later.

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:16.919
TRAVIS: All right.

00:17:16.919 --> 00:17:18.274
LIAM: And it all makes sense to you?

00:17:18.274 --> 00:17:19.849
TALIESIN: I'll explain later!

00:17:19.849 --> 00:17:22.708
MARISHA: This club is awesome!

00:17:22.708 --> 00:17:24.170
TALIESIN: I hate you.

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:26.134
SAM: Do I have to change my name in this club?

00:17:26.134 --> 00:17:28.971
MARISHA: Are we all supposed to change our names?

00:17:28.971 --> 00:17:30.724
SAM: We should all come up with different names.

00:17:30.724 --> 00:17:34.985
TALIESIN: It might be easier just to have them all
killed right now-- I didn't say that out loud. I

00:17:34.985 --> 00:17:39.156
didn't say that out loud. I'm just thinking out
loud, oh, god. It's going to be fine, I'm not

00:17:39.194 --> 00:17:40.239
panicking.

00:17:40.239 --> 00:17:41.762
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Let's go get drinks!

00:17:41.762 --> 00:17:48.291
MATT: At this point, a hand claps and the tabaxi
is now at one of the tables and has shooed off one

00:17:48.339 --> 00:17:52.282
of the drinks and goes, "This way, I found a table
for everyone."

00:17:52.282 --> 00:17:59.056
TALIESIN: Come, sit down. I give the tabaxi
another hug as we sit down. How have you been?

00:17:59.056 --> 00:18:00.335
It's been ages!

00:18:00.335 --> 00:18:09.317
MATT: "Oh, too long. I apologize for using your
old name. Nonagon, it is a pleasure to see you again."

00:18:09.317 --> 00:18:13.895
TRAVIS: Not a chance. I didn't catch that at all.

00:18:13.895 --> 00:18:15.467
MATT: Nonagon was what you heard.

00:18:15.467 --> 00:18:18.317
MARISHA: Nonagon.

00:18:18.317 --> 00:18:23.152
SAM: That's the tabaxi, not the ogre?

00:18:23.152 --> 00:18:25.153
MATT: No, the tabaxi said that.

00:18:25.153 --> 00:18:26.488
TALIESIN: That's my name.

00:18:26.488 --> 00:18:27.850
MARISHA: Wait.

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:29.055
TRAVIS: Lucien Nonagon.

00:18:29.055 --> 00:18:32.529
MATT: Basically what was said was, "I'm sorry for
saying your old name, Nonagon." Was correcting

00:18:32.529 --> 00:18:34.844
Lucien to Mollymauk.

00:18:34.844 --> 00:18:39.493
MARISHA: Wait, is Nonagon like a slang for-- or
like a word for sorry?

00:18:39.493 --> 00:18:41.047
MATT: You don't know.

00:18:41.047 --> 00:18:44.472
TALIESIN: Who can keep track these days? Again, a
long story.

00:18:44.472 --> 00:18:51.165
MATT: "Nonagon, what happened? We watched you
die."

00:18:51.165 --> 00:18:59.227
TALIESIN: That is a story for another day and
another drink. What did you see? God, I don't

00:18:59.227 --> 00:19:02.581
know what that looked like from the other end of
things.

00:19:02.581 --> 00:19:09.026
MATT "Well, it all went belly up two years ago.
You told us to scatter and vanish if it didn't--

00:19:09.026 --> 00:19:16.773
"if things went wrong and wait until you returned.
We buried your ass in the woods outside of the

00:19:16.773 --> 00:19:18.165
"hideout, I mean-- "

00:19:18.165 --> 00:19:22.147
TALIESIN: It may not have necessarily been my ass
that you buried.

00:19:22.147 --> 00:19:24.397
MATT: "Apparently."

00:19:24.397 --> 00:19:27.301
TALIESIN: I had a few tricks up my sleeve.

00:19:27.301 --> 00:19:36.567
MATT: (laughs) "Well, that spell-spitter
lady from the capital. She said you were gone, she

00:19:36.582 --> 00:19:41.706
"took the book and left, and her contract said
she was in the right and that we knew better than

00:19:41.748 --> 00:19:43.936
"to go toe to toe with her and her ilk."

00:19:43.936 --> 00:19:48.690
TALIESIN: Obviously. Is everybody else all right?
I know it has been a while. I had to stay

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:50.275
underground.

00:19:50.275 --> 00:19:57.008
MATT: "Unfortunately, Jurrel met with the axe of
the law shortly after you left us."

00:19:57.008 --> 00:19:58.401
TALIESIN: Damn shame.

00:19:58.401 --> 00:20:02.641
MATT: "Zoran, Ottis, and Tyffial have all
scattered amongst the empire..."

00:20:02.641 --> 00:20:04.135
TALIESIN: Damn shame.

00:20:04.135 --> 00:20:05.737
MATT: "But, do you want me to find the others?"

00:20:05.737 --> 00:20:06.994
TALIESIN: No, actually I'm--

00:20:06.994 --> 00:20:08.186
MATT: "I know where Tyffial is!"

00:20:08.186 --> 00:20:12.890
TALIESIN: Where is Tyffial? I would rather
obviously deliver everything in person. Honestly

00:20:12.890 --> 00:20:16.887
if I had known you were here I would've made
arrangements. I didn't want to shock you.

00:20:16.887 --> 00:20:22.047
MATT: "She's up in Nogvurot. We can travel there,
I can send a message and have her come down to us."

00:20:22.047 --> 00:20:25.912
TALIESIN: I'm working on something very delicate,
I need everything to be very quiet.

00:20:25.912 --> 00:20:27.842
MATT: "Very well, Nonagon."

00:20:27.842 --> 00:20:30.547
LIAM: I apologize, I'm not very observant. I
missed your name.

00:20:30.547 --> 00:20:32.094
TALIESIN: Where are my manners?

00:20:32.094 --> 00:20:34.187
MATT: "My apologies. My name is Cree."

00:20:34.187 --> 00:20:35.345
LIAM: Cree?

00:20:35.345 --> 00:20:45.415
MATT: "I am a member of the, well, the family
around-- how much do they know?"

00:20:45.415 --> 00:20:46.955
SAM: We know a lot!

00:20:46.955 --> 00:20:48.820
ASHLEY: We pretty much know all of it, so.

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:52.757
SAM: We were told the name of the group that you
traveled with, but I can't remember it now.

00:20:52.757 --> 00:20:59.304
TALIESIN: They don't know a lot, but they're
trustworthy. I've been putting my trust in them so far.

00:20:59.304 --> 00:21:04.618
ASHLEY: I do, I know all of it, so you can just
tell me if you want to.

00:21:04.618 --> 00:21:06.067
TALIESIN: That's actually fair.

00:21:06.067 --> 00:21:10.123
MATT: Make a deception check, both of you.

00:21:10.123 --> 00:21:11.120
SAM: Me?

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:12.228
MATT: Yeah.

00:21:12.228 --> 00:21:13.786
SAM: I'm the worst. 13.

00:21:13.786 --> 00:21:17.270
TALIESIN: Technically advantage because it's kind
of the truth?

00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:21.732
MATT: Technically? All right, sure, I'll give you
that.

00:21:21.732 --> 00:21:26.830
ASHLEY: I got a ten, but technically I know-- I'm
rolling at advantage?

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:29.925
TALIESIN: Yeah, I think that's advantage. I begged
for advantage on that one.

00:21:29.925 --> 00:21:31.405
MATT: I'll give you that.

00:21:31.405 --> 00:21:32.149
ASHLEY: 16.

00:21:32.149 --> 00:21:32.887
TALIESIN: Okay, thank you.

00:21:32.887 --> 00:21:50.336
MATT: "Well, we were all part of the same order at
one point, and we splintered off. Luci-- Nonagon

00:21:50.336 --> 00:21:59.431
"had a different path in mind for us, so we went
north to Shady Creek Run and we started the Tomb

00:21:59.431 --> 00:22:07.873
"Takers. It's just so good to see you."

00:22:07.873 --> 00:22:13.813
TALIESIN: It's good to be seen again. But again,
it's got to be very quiet right now. It's been

00:22:13.813 --> 00:22:16.147
like three other names since the last time I saw
you.

00:22:16.147 --> 00:22:20.813
MATT: "I should inform the others."

00:22:20.813 --> 00:22:27.364
TALIESIN: Please, keep it quiet for now. That book
caused more trouble than you think, and it all

00:22:27.364 --> 00:22:31.154
laid on my shoulders. I was trying to protect the
rest of you from some of the worst elements of

00:22:31.154 --> 00:22:37.296
that and I don't want any heat dropping on anybody
who doesn't know what's coming yet.

00:22:37.296 --> 00:22:38.671
MATT: "Of course."

00:22:38.671 --> 00:22:42.881
TALIESIN: But let me know where they are and I'll
get a hold of them. But don't let them know why yet.

00:22:42.881 --> 00:22:47.872
MATT: The tabaxi curls in a little bit, leans over
the table towards you with this big grin and says,

00:22:47.872 --> 00:22:50.133
"Does this mean that it worked?"

00:22:50.133 --> 00:22:56.869
TALIESIN: (sighs) That's, again, mixed company and
public company.

00:22:56.869 --> 00:23:02.444
SAM: No, you can tell us about the ritual!
Ritual?

00:23:02.444 --> 00:23:05.158
MATT: There's a look of recognition.

00:23:05.158 --> 00:23:14.194
SAM: Yes, it was successful! Remind me what it was
again? There's been so many rituals lately!

00:23:14.194 --> 00:23:19.324
TALIESIN: Mixed results.

00:23:19.324 --> 00:23:25.158
LIAM: You were mentioning this group, the Tomb
Takers. You had another name before. Were you a

00:23:25.158 --> 00:23:28.563
group and our friend joined you at some point?

00:23:28.563 --> 00:23:38.576
MATT: "Well, he led us away from the original
order. They were a bit... clouded. We had a new path."

00:23:38.576 --> 00:23:41.483
TRAVIS: Wow.

00:23:41.483 --> 00:23:46.576
MARISHA: And what was the name of the original
order you were a part of?

00:23:46.576 --> 00:23:50.426
SAM: Not the Tomb Takers, that was the splinter
group, right?

00:23:50.426 --> 00:23:51.991
LIAM: The one that came before.

00:23:51.991 --> 00:23:57.868
MATT: There's a few looks now of-- the euphoria is
washing away from the face.

00:23:57.868 --> 00:24:00.493
TALIESIN: You don't have to tell them anything you
don't want to tell them, that's all right.

00:24:00.493 --> 00:24:02.586
ASHLEY: Was he your new path?

00:24:02.586 --> 00:24:07.469
MATT: "He brought us onto a new path, yes."

00:24:07.469 --> 00:24:12.521
LIAM: What was your unifying trait or pursuit?

00:24:12.521 --> 00:24:16.423
TALIESIN: Foolishness in thinking I knew what I
was doing.

00:24:16.423 --> 00:24:18.124
SAM: That is not a good answer!

00:24:18.124 --> 00:24:19.508
TALIESIN: That's the answer you're getting.

00:24:19.508 --> 00:24:24.093
TRAVIS: This is all well and good and kind of
fucking boring. I couldn't help but notice that

00:24:24.093 --> 00:24:26.603
surly-looking crew up there, who might that be?

00:24:26.603 --> 00:24:32.953
MATT: "Oh, these are all members of The
Gentleman's troupe, as am I." At which point the

00:24:32.953 --> 00:24:38.096
tabaxi, Cree, turns back and looks, and you can
see in the far back right corner of the chamber

00:24:38.096 --> 00:24:46.345
there is a long, dark mahogany well-carved table.
There you see standing, arms crossed, a very

00:24:46.345 --> 00:24:56.292
muscular-looking goliath female with a very short
leather strap top, shaved sides of the head in a

00:24:56.292 --> 00:25:02.390
tuft of a mohawk that curls down into a long
ponytail that goes down the back, who's glaring in

00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:10.988
your direction. Sitting beside this burly-looking
goliath you see a high-backed chair with a red

00:25:10.988 --> 00:25:19.930
velvet matte. Sitting feet crossed up on the table
in a nice, long deep-blue coat, leather-gloved

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:29.466
hands, light teal skin, jet-black hair that's
long, just past the shoulders, a widow's peak in

00:25:29.466 --> 00:25:37.308
the center, a bit of a dark goatee, male figure
standing there, hands entwined and crossed,

00:25:37.308 --> 00:25:43.520
looking at you from across the way with a curious
grin. "The Gentleman."

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.404
TALIESIN: You work for The Gentleman these days?

00:25:45.404 --> 00:25:51.561
MATT: "We had to find work, we didn't know if you
were ever coming back. We thought-- so we had to

00:25:51.561 --> 00:25:57.421
"move on. We knew you'd eventually return, I just
did not know how long and we had to make ends meet."

00:25:57.421 --> 00:25:59.861
TALIESIN: How is it, working for The Gentleman?

00:25:59.861 --> 00:26:11.192
MATT: "Work is fine--" You hear a (clapping) from
The Gentleman. "So! We have company. Strangers in

00:26:11.192 --> 00:26:18.758
"our midst." He rights himself in the chair.
"Please, come before me. Present yourselves! I

00:26:18.758 --> 00:26:28.107
"want to know who has graced us with their majestic
presence. Come, come." The finger goes up and you

00:26:28.107 --> 00:26:31.731
watch as everyone holding the rifles cock them and
point down at you.

00:26:31.731 --> 00:26:33.145
SAM: Fjord, say something!

00:26:33.145 --> 00:26:34.311
MATT: "Come!"

00:26:34.311 --> 00:26:37.732
TALIESIN: I'm looking at our friend.

00:26:37.732 --> 00:26:40.147
MATT: Cree goes--

00:26:40.147 --> 00:26:50.765
TALIESIN: All right, I'll saunter over with my
drink and sit down at the table. Come on everyone,

00:26:50.765 --> 00:26:52.296
let's do this.

00:26:52.296 --> 00:26:58.479
MATT: So you all go and sit? There's a long bench
there on the opposite side of this table where you

00:26:58.479 --> 00:27:00.768
can either stand or sit, since there's quite a few
of you.

00:27:00.768 --> 00:27:01.962
ASHLEY: I'll stand.

00:27:01.962 --> 00:27:09.461
MATT: Jester is like, "I don't know what's going
on." Sorry, Laura. I don't know what the fuck

00:27:09.461 --> 00:27:14.715
Jester would do. Jester is the most random
character.

00:27:14.715 --> 00:27:17.538
LIAM: She's going Homer Simpson, running circles
around.

00:27:17.538 --> 00:27:19.054
TALIESIN: She's giving out leaflets.

00:27:19.054 --> 00:27:24.044
LIAM: I will also stand.

00:27:24.044 --> 00:27:28.870
MATT: As you guys approach you hear this (wheezing
laughter). There's the second balcony that was

00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:32.730
facing in the direction where you entered. As you
look up you can see there's another rifleman

00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:39.323
standing, and hanging by one arm off the side, you
see this crazed-looking young gnome with this big

00:27:39.367 --> 00:27:44.357
mound of curly hair and this big chinstrap beard
who's just dangling going (wheezing laughter),

00:27:44.357 --> 00:27:50.011
looking over you all from a distance really
creepily. The ogre's there still, hand on the

00:27:50.011 --> 00:28:01.208
maul. "So. Introductions, please! I think I have
an idea who you are, but I want to hear it from

00:28:01.208 --> 00:28:03.362
"your mouths. Please, tell me."

00:28:03.362 --> 00:28:06.751
TRAVIS: Humbly, we are members of The Mighty
Nein.

00:28:06.751 --> 00:28:14.218
MATT: "I knew it, I knew it! (laughs) Oh, this is
a gracious day. Very well. Welcome to the real

00:28:14.218 --> 00:28:19.988
"Evening Nip. Pleasure to have you, each and every
one of you. I've seen you around upstairs,

00:28:19.988 --> 00:28:23.898
"wandering and skulking a bit. I didn't know you
were part of this mighty troupe."

00:28:23.898 --> 00:28:32.125
ASHLEY: Well, I hang out with them, but I actually
like the drinks here a lot, so.

00:28:32.125 --> 00:28:36.256
MATT: "Much better down here. Speaking of which, a
round please!" The bartender, looking a bit

00:28:36.256 --> 00:28:43.816
frightened on the side, starts filling tankards.
"All right, so. What brings such esteemed

00:28:43.816 --> 00:28:47.012
"adventurers to my pocket of the underworld?"

00:28:47.012 --> 00:28:53.086
TRAVIS: Well, we sought an audience, and to be
frank, we thought we might find a little bit more

00:28:53.086 --> 00:28:57.120
of a warm reception than the one that we're
currently getting.

00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:03.680
MATT: "Oh! I'm sorry." They pull the rifles off
you. "Habit. Safety, you understand."

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:06.119
TRAVIS: Oh of course, easily understood.

00:29:06.119 --> 00:29:09.844
MATT: "So. You have my audience."

00:29:09.844 --> 00:29:14.923
TRAVIS: We mean to make ourselves of service,
whether it be for the good of the city or other

00:29:14.923 --> 00:29:22.729
endeavors. We're new here. We thought we would try
to make as many introductions and have as many

00:29:22.729 --> 00:29:24.186
meetings happen as we could.

00:29:24.186 --> 00:29:29.829
MATT: "Interesting. I have one question, before we
get too deep in this conversation. How did you

00:29:29.829 --> 00:29:33.321
"find your way in here?"

00:29:33.321 --> 00:29:46.664
MARISHA: I'm a bit of an enthusiast of the
underworld. So I came across some information.

00:29:46.664 --> 00:29:48.059
MATT: "Go on."

00:29:48.059 --> 00:29:53.519
MARISHA: Demedan got his order of bloodroot. It
was really good.

00:29:53.519 --> 00:29:55.659
MATT: "Demedan gave you this information?"

00:29:55.659 --> 00:30:01.718
MARISHA: No, Demedan was clumsy with his
information.

00:30:01.718 --> 00:30:12.950
MATT: "Equally dangerous, good to know. Remember
that." The goliath cracks knuckles. "All right,

00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:23.292
"so. Interesting. Now you know the way in. That's
dangerous, as we've just made acquaintances and

00:30:23.292 --> 00:30:29.676
"you now know the direct path into my domain. So to
make this a comfortable conversation and possibly

00:30:29.676 --> 00:30:34.731
"an arrangement going forward that we can all agree
upon, I have one small request."

00:30:34.731 --> 00:30:37.473
TRAVIS: Oh, I'm sure we'd be all ears.

00:30:37.473 --> 00:30:46.347
MATT: "Cree! Please." The tabaxi who was in the
back goes, "Yes, of course." Steps over to the

00:30:46.722 --> 00:30:50.886
side of the bar and picks up a small leather
satchel, puts it over her shoulder, walks up

00:30:50.886 --> 00:30:57.936
behind the table, opens it, and pulls out an
alchemist rack of a bunch of corked vials, like

00:30:57.936 --> 00:31:04.629
small vials, opens it, and says, "I need, just--
and bear with me, please-- just a small bit of

00:31:04.629 --> 00:31:12.933
"your blood. The reasoning being, if I can't trust
you, and you can't trust me, how am I to know you

00:31:12.933 --> 00:31:17.750
"aren't going to turn me in immediately outside to
the King's Hall? And I need some means in case you

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:22.621
"just abscond with this information: perhaps make
an arrangement with me and then leave town. I need

00:31:22.621 --> 00:31:23.215
"to find you."

00:31:23.215 --> 00:31:28.787
TRAVIS: Oh, of course, and forgive my ignorance.
This would be used to locate us? Is that what this

00:31:28.787 --> 00:31:29.564
is for?

00:31:29.564 --> 00:31:31.280
MATT: Oh, that is Cree's speciality.

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:35.287
TALIESIN: It is definitely Cree's speciality.

00:31:35.287 --> 00:31:36.650
TRAVIS: Yeah, fuck it.

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:45.009
MATT: As you pull your hand out, Cree does a flick
of the finger, and you watch as the blood trails

00:31:45.009 --> 00:31:51.011
off on its own like a small serpent of mercury and
just (flowing). For a second, even though it was a

00:31:51.011 --> 00:31:55.100
small wound, it's bleeding quite a bit and you're
like, "Uh." It makes you a little uncomfortable

00:31:55.100 --> 00:32:00.770
and then all of a sudden the blood flow stops. The
vial is filled about an inch full, then she caps

00:32:00.770 --> 00:32:02.654
it. "Thank you so much."

00:32:02.654 --> 00:32:05.510
TRAVIS: How did you do that?

00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:13.563
MATT: "It's a gift that I learned the same place
where the Nonagon's gifts were found."

00:32:13.563 --> 00:32:15.899
TALIESIN: Lucien, at the table, is fine.

00:32:15.899 --> 00:32:16.454
MATT: "Lucien."

00:32:16.454 --> 00:32:17.574
TRAVIS: Right.

00:32:17.574 --> 00:32:19.225
MATT: "Next."

00:32:19.225 --> 00:32:25.122
TALIESIN: I trust you with this. Don't get fancy.

00:32:25.122 --> 00:32:33.221
MATT: Same thing. Fills the next vial, a strange,
almost an arc of crimson finds its way and fills a

00:32:33.221 --> 00:32:37.711
secondary tube. There's like twelve tubes there,
but she'll fill as many as needed for this one.

00:32:37.711 --> 00:32:42.870
TRAVIS: (laughs) Don't like it, do you?

00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:45.555
MARISHA: Can I borrow a tusk?

00:32:45.555 --> 00:32:46.133
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:32:46.133 --> 00:32:53.691
MATT: Goes ahead and acquires the blood from you.
Jester goes, "Me too, me too!" Feeling left out in

00:32:53.691 --> 00:32:56.762
the moment, gives her blood as well.

00:32:56.762 --> 00:33:00.599
SAM: Caleb, are we doing this?

00:33:00.599 --> 00:33:08.124
MATT: "No harm will come to you, unless you bring
harm to me. So this is just a precautionary

00:33:08.124 --> 00:33:11.082
"measure. I appreciate your trust."

00:33:11.082 --> 00:33:22.483
TRAVIS: Three to go? One, two, three?

00:33:22.483 --> 00:33:25.152
MATT: With that, your blood is taken into a vial.

00:33:25.152 --> 00:33:27.334
SAM: All right, I'll follow suit.

00:33:27.334 --> 00:33:29.499
MATT: Your blood is also taken into a vial.

00:33:29.499 --> 00:33:30.874
SAM: (hisses)

00:33:30.874 --> 00:33:34.133
MATT: Easy enough to do! (spurting)

00:33:34.133 --> 00:33:41.288
ASHLEY: Fair enough. I take my finger and I run it
across my blade as I stare at him.

00:33:41.288 --> 00:33:48.385
MATT: The blood is drawn into the vial, the final
vial is capped, Cree closes the satchel, places it

00:33:48.385 --> 00:33:52.619
on the shoulder, and then bows and steps back,
paying direct attention to The Gentleman and then

00:33:52.619 --> 00:33:57.274
out of the corner of her eye, towards you.
"Fantastic, I really appreciate that." You're

00:33:57.274 --> 00:34:02.749
getting a closer look now, of The Gentleman. The
teal skin tone-- it's interesting. It looks almost

00:34:02.749 --> 00:34:09.628
like he's perpetually sweating. There's moisture
on the outskirts of his skin at all times. There's

00:34:09.628 --> 00:34:17.054
the faint hint of, whether it be condensation from
the air around or produced internally, there's a

00:34:17.054 --> 00:34:28.630
general sense of dampness to the skin of this
figure. "So an arrangement, you say. First off,

00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:32.853
"just because it's fun for me, are you believers in
luck?"

00:34:32.853 --> 00:34:35.387
TALIESIN: Not anymore.

00:34:36.737 --> 00:34:38.218
TRAVIS: Yes, I'd say I am.

00:34:38.228 --> 00:34:43.487
MATT: "That destiny is looking out for you? I've
seen enough in my time and have lived in spite of

00:34:43.487 --> 00:34:48.768
"it all because something wants me here. Would you
consider yourselves lucky?"

00:34:48.768 --> 00:34:51.735
TRAVIS, SAM and TALIESIN: Yes.

00:34:51.735 --> 00:34:53.214
MATT: "Good. Then let's gamble."

00:34:54.224 --> 00:34:54.918
MARISHA: Then what?

00:34:54.918 --> 00:34:56.268
MATT: Then let's gamble.

00:34:56.268 --> 00:34:57.184
MARISHA: Oh. (laughs)

00:34:57.184 --> 00:34:58.788
TRAVIS: Are you writing that down?

00:35:00.458 --> 00:35:01.966
SAM: Let's gamble.

00:35:01.966 --> 00:35:13.595
MATT: "I want to know how lucky my investments
are. Gambit of Ord? Who wishes to face me in this?

00:35:13.595 --> 00:35:16.436
"Who feels the luckiest of your band?"

00:35:16.436 --> 00:35:19.827
TRAVIS: Shit. Where's the fucking luck of Jester?

00:35:19.827 --> 00:35:21.554
MARISHA: I know. She's at home.

00:35:21.554 --> 00:35:27.185
SAM: I watched her play last time, I could do-- I
don't-- (stutters)

00:35:27.185 --> 00:35:28.709
TRAVIS: I could as well.

00:35:28.709 --> 00:35:32.388
SAM: Why don't you do it? I'll just drink-- I need
just a little loosener.

00:35:32.388 --> 00:35:34.786
TRAVIS: All right. I feel lucky.

00:35:34.786 --> 00:35:49.676
MATT: "All right. Great. One pass. 50 gold buy-in.
If I win, you're mine. If you win, then we can do business."

00:35:49.676 --> 00:35:50.501
TRAVIS: Deal.

00:35:50.501 --> 00:35:56.218
MATT: "All right." He goes and pulls, beneath the
table, a satchel of gold. Pulls out a handful of

00:35:56.218 --> 00:36:04.454
gold and plops it on the table. You watch on the
side as the creepy gnomish figure that was hanging

00:36:04.454 --> 00:36:12.105
from the balcony earlier leaps down, (creepy
chuckling) comes up and he pulls out a set of

00:36:12.105 --> 00:36:18.052
cards and is shuffling them in his hand as he
steps around the side. He's now flanking the right

00:36:18.052 --> 00:36:22.996
side of The Gentleman, so you have the large
goliath on one side, the small, creepy gnome on

00:36:22.996 --> 00:36:28.847
the other, shuffling the cards. Hands the deck to
The Gentleman, does one final cut, sets it down.

00:36:28.847 --> 00:36:32.090
"So what's your name?"

00:36:32.090 --> 00:36:33.090
TRAVIS: Fjord.

00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:38.254
MATT: "Fjord. Let us deal." Did you put 50 gold on
the table?

00:36:38.254 --> 00:36:41.374
TRAVIS: No. Now I do.

00:36:43.494 --> 00:36:46.653
TALIESIN: There was nothing fishy in the card
shuffle, in the cut, was there?

00:36:46.653 --> 00:36:48.204
MATT: Make an insight check.

00:36:48.204 --> 00:36:49.566
TRAVIS: Ooh, get 'em!

00:36:49.566 --> 00:36:51.618
TALIESIN: Let's do it. 12.

00:36:52.218 --> 00:36:53.542
MATT: Seemed to be above board.

00:36:54.492 --> 00:36:56.666
MARISHA: I'm going to keep an eye on the deal as
well.

00:36:56.666 --> 00:37:02.946
MATT: Okay. The first cards are dealt out for the
first round. This is Gambit of Ord. This is

00:37:02.946 --> 00:37:09.926
different from The Crick-Queen's Call. This is a
Marquesian card game. Roll a d8, but keep it

00:37:09.926 --> 00:37:22.831
hidden to yourself. All right. "So now, I'm going
to go ahead and raise another 50 gold." (clinking)

00:37:22.831 --> 00:37:23.553
Onto the table.

00:37:23.553 --> 00:37:25.176
TRAVIS: My goodness, this is getting expensive
quite fast.

00:37:25.176 --> 00:37:29.949
MATT: "Well, we deal with quite a large amount of
business."

00:37:29.949 --> 00:37:31.455
TRAVIS: (yawning) 50 gold.

00:37:32.245 --> 00:37:33.265
MATT: So you put another 50 gold?

00:37:33.265 --> 00:37:33.925
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

00:37:33.925 --> 00:37:47.578
MATT: All right. Go ahead and roll a d6, and keep
that secret alongside that die. "Do you wish to raise?"

00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:49.471
TRAVIS: You first.

00:37:49.471 --> 00:37:53.495
MATT: "I raised first last time. I'm offering you
the chance to raise if you'd like."

00:37:53.495 --> 00:37:57.013
TRAVIS: Funny how that works. No, I'm good where I
am.

00:37:58.723 --> 00:38:02.266
MATT: "Interesting. I'll raise another 50 gold."

00:38:02.266 --> 00:38:02.824
SAM: Oh god.

00:38:02.824 --> 00:38:05.320
TRAVIS: Sounds good. 50 it is.

00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:20.535
MATT: Go ahead and roll a d4. He's holding his
cards in his hand, looks across at you, looks all

00:38:20.535 --> 00:38:27.020
throughout the room. "Well, Fjord, looks like it's
time to call."

00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:29.398
TRAVIS: What, we're not going to bet again?

00:38:29.403 --> 00:38:36.493
(silence)

00:38:36.493 --> 00:38:38.157
MATT: Puts another 100 gold on the table.

00:38:40.487 --> 00:38:41.819
TRAVIS: Let's make it 150.

00:38:41.819 --> 00:38:47.132
MATT: (laughs) "Very well."

00:38:47.132 --> 00:38:49.205
TRAVIS: (mutters) That's all the money I have.

00:38:49.205 --> 00:38:52.677
SAM: Have we seen anything suspicious from the
deals, or the--

00:38:52.677 --> 00:38:56.299
LIAM: (as Jester) Jester wants you to know that
from home she is watching The Gentleman and making

00:38:56.299 --> 00:38:57.889
sure he is not cheating.

00:38:57.889 --> 00:39:01.933
MATT: Make an insight check for Jester, and you
make an insight check as well, since you were both

00:39:01.933 --> 00:39:03.218
keeping a close eye on that.

00:39:03.218 --> 00:39:07.957
LIAM: Oh, she rolled really well. What's her
modifier, added to an 18?

00:39:07.957 --> 00:39:08.718
SAM: Plus four.

00:39:08.718 --> 00:39:09.553
LIAM: Oh, 22.

00:39:09.553 --> 00:39:18.833
MATT: 22? Actually, there has been no weirdness
with the cards. This is a straight test of luck.

00:39:18.833 --> 00:39:20.624
LIAM: (as Jester) Oh, this man has the Luck feat.

00:39:23.224 --> 00:39:25.633
MATT: Yeah, you don't see anything, nothing that
catches you off.

00:39:25.633 --> 00:39:27.157
MARISHA: Yeah, I rolled less than Jester.

00:39:28.247 --> 00:39:35.782
MATT: So, we're now at a pot of 150 times two, 50
times two, so 600 gold, I believe, right? 50, 50,

00:39:35.782 --> 00:39:38.838
50, and the 150.

00:39:38.838 --> 00:39:43.651
TRAVIS: (counting) So 500.

00:39:43.651 --> 00:39:44.729
SAM: Did you start with 50, though?

00:39:44.729 --> 00:39:47.737
MATT: We started with 50, and then we raised 50,
and then raised 50, so that was 150. So it's 600

00:39:47.737 --> 00:39:48.181
on the table.

00:39:48.181 --> 00:39:48.844
TRAVIS: I can do math.

00:39:48.844 --> 00:39:55.883
MATT: 300 from each of them. "All right." He
presents the dice that he had rolled, or the cards

00:39:55.883 --> 00:39:59.776
that he had found, which is a five, a four, and a
one. A grand total of ten.

00:39:59.776 --> 00:40:01.188
MARISHA: Oh my god, come on, Fjord.

00:40:01.188 --> 00:40:02.360
TRAVIS: A seven, a five, and a three.

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:04.341
(cheering)

00:40:04.341 --> 00:40:06.396
MARISHA: Oh my god.

00:40:06.396 --> 00:40:08.862
SAM: That's the first thing we've ever won.

00:40:08.862 --> 00:40:12.317
(laughter)

00:40:12.317 --> 00:40:18.036
MATT: As soon as you reveal the cards there's a
(gasp). A gasp in the room and The Gentleman, his

00:40:18.036 --> 00:40:28.136
muscles tense for a second and he goes, (laughs)
"Well-played and well earned! Take the coin, it's yours."

00:40:28.136 --> 00:40:29.540
TRAVIS: Thank you. Nice hand.

00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:33.609
MATT: "Good to know that we have luck on your side
as well. That's very important to me with people I

00:40:33.609 --> 00:40:39.823
"do business with. So (clears throat) you have some
balls throwing down that change and going into a

00:40:39.823 --> 00:40:48.526
"game with me, I like that. So what can our many
gifts and my associates present to you? What are

00:40:48.526 --> 00:40:52.869
"your strengths? What are your skills? I've heard
you've done some deeds. I've heard you killed some

00:40:52.869 --> 00:40:55.308
"terrible creature in the sewers, is that
correct?"

00:40:57.748 --> 00:41:05.135
SAM: We did. Yes. We fought and killed a giant
spider of sorts.

00:41:05.135 --> 00:41:09.898
MATT: "Right, which helped tremendously because we
use the sewers quite often. That had become an

00:41:09.898 --> 00:41:15.279
"issue with some of our transference in the
subterranean sewers of the city. And

00:41:15.279 --> 00:41:21.184
"unfortunately, the underworks themselves have been
a bit clogged as of late. So thank you for that.

00:41:21.184 --> 00:41:25.783
"And one of our compatriots--" and he points up to
one of the balconies on the side, and you can see,

00:41:25.783 --> 00:41:32.135
behind the individual that had the rifle, you see
Kara, the half-elf.

00:41:32.135 --> 00:41:33.588
MARISHA: Oh, I was going to ask for her.

00:41:33.588 --> 00:41:39.403
MATT: Who's stepping forward, ever so slightly.
And says, "One of our compatriots has kept us up

00:41:39.403 --> 00:41:45.392
"to speed about your infiltrations. I have to say,
I'm impressed."

00:41:45.392 --> 00:41:50.244
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, then you probably know we are not the
best you're going to find, but we are up and comers.

00:41:51.254 --> 00:41:52.086
MATT: "Not too bad."

00:41:52.466 --> 00:41:55.403
TRAVIS: Very versatile I'd have to say though.
Balanced.

00:41:55.403 --> 00:41:56.459
LIAM: Good skill set.

00:41:57.449 --> 00:41:59.012
TALIESIN: High profile, but low profile.

00:42:00.492 --> 00:42:05.418
MATT: "Well, we are a company that specializes in
the completion of the tasks and trading of things.

00:42:05.418 --> 00:42:11.739
"Perhaps not the most legal. Things that are
restricted by the empire. That means our skills

00:42:11.739 --> 00:42:18.708
"are best through speed, subterfuge, darkness. We
don't have the best, aside for muscle besides

00:42:18.708 --> 00:42:23.095
"from, well (laughs) I do keep Sorah by my side,
just in case."

00:42:23.455 --> 00:42:24.529
SAM: Is that the goliath?

00:42:24.529 --> 00:42:25.819
MATT: That is the goliath he refers to.

00:42:25.819 --> 00:42:26.585
SAM: Sorad?

00:42:26.585 --> 00:42:27.219
MATT: Sorah.

00:42:27.219 --> 00:42:29.784
LIAM: (singing) Que Sorah, Sorah.

00:42:29.784 --> 00:42:31.027
MARISHA: Wait the goliath or the ogre?

00:42:31.027 --> 00:42:32.382
MATT and TRAVIS: The goliath.

00:42:32.382 --> 00:42:33.091
MARISHA: The--

00:42:33.091 --> 00:42:34.376
LIAM: The mohawk lady.

00:42:34.376 --> 00:42:34.813
MARISHA: Okay.

00:42:40.713 --> 00:42:42.300
SAM: We're very strong.

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:43.154
MATT: "Very good."

00:42:43.154 --> 00:42:48.186
SAM: As you can see, Yasha is very strong.

00:42:49.486 --> 00:42:53.470
MATT: "Well, you've caused enough chaos in the
Tri-Spire. You brought down one of the more

00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:58.638
"corrupt, though strangely uncorruptible from our
end, politicians we've seen. And from what I hear,

00:42:58.638 --> 00:43:01.399
"Lord Sutan is already in chains." (chuckles)

00:43:02.459 --> 00:43:05.032
SAM: (quickly) We don't know anything about that.
We had nothing to do with it.

00:43:05.692 --> 00:43:07.248
TRAVIS: Nott, I think--

00:43:08.198 --> 00:43:09.891
TALIESIN: She's quick to toe the party line.

00:43:09.891 --> 00:43:10.311
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:43:10.311 --> 00:43:16.808
MATT: "That's fine. We'll see how long Sutan stays
in there, he has his ways. Depending on how strong

00:43:16.808 --> 00:43:24.024
"a case you've left behind, and a little finagling
on our end, if our partnership grows mutually

00:43:24.024 --> 00:43:29.083
"beneficial, perhaps we could push that over the
edge for him, and keep him away for quite some

00:43:29.083 --> 00:43:36.934
"time. Now apparently I've also heard they're still
seeking the murderers of the High-Richter.

00:43:36.934 --> 00:43:43.579
"Particularly a purple-skinned tiefling who was
spotted not far from the home that night, with

00:43:43.579 --> 00:43:48.679
"rather ostentatious clothing. As well as a
wandering dark-skinned youth, a woman with

00:43:48.679 --> 00:43:54.285
"physical capability. So that doesn't bode well for
you, does it?"

00:43:55.215 --> 00:43:57.465
MARISHA: Sucks being in the wrong place at the
wrong time.

00:43:58.735 --> 00:44:04.328
MATT: "Well, as seeing as how we're friends
now, I can say that I could probably make this

00:44:04.328 --> 00:44:06.932
"investigation go away."

00:44:08.762 --> 00:44:11.887
MARISHA: Is this an investigation that you caused
to begin with?

00:44:11.887 --> 00:44:14.700
MATT: (laughs) "No, this is an investigation that
you caused."

00:44:15.490 --> 00:44:18.619
MARISHA: Doing your bidding.

00:44:18.619 --> 00:44:19.042
MATT: "No."

00:44:19.042 --> 00:44:20.509
MARISHA: Through one of your associates.

00:44:20.509 --> 00:44:27.454
MATT: "My associate was making sure that the
events would transpire in our favor. But

00:44:27.454 --> 00:44:30.710
"nevertheless, we were not the orchestrators of The
Knights of Requital."

00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:34.733
LIAM: Let's assume this is not a gift you are
offering, what is it that you are looking for in return?

00:44:35.263 --> 00:44:40.371
MATT: "Oh, well, many gifts come once we've
established a partnership. We become friends now,

00:44:40.371 --> 00:44:49.180
"and I like friendship. That's great; that's fine.
But I deal in trade mostly. So I would like a

00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:55.971
"favor in kind." He leans forwards a bit, and you
can see some of the condensation slowly dripping

00:44:55.971 --> 00:45:00.094
down the side of the face. Making a few spots on
the table.

00:45:01.244 --> 00:45:03.057
SAM: I'll offer him a napkin.

00:45:04.237 --> 00:45:07.941
MATT: As you hold a napkin out, the eyes catch you
for a second. The head turns, confused for a second.

00:45:07.941 --> 00:45:09.610
TALIESIN: Just--

00:45:09.610 --> 00:45:12.557
(laughter)

00:45:12.557 --> 00:45:14.701
TALIESIN: Great thought, not now. Good thought.

00:45:14.701 --> 00:45:16.089
SAM: He seems like he needs--

00:45:16.089 --> 00:45:16.919
TALIESIN: (shushing)

00:45:16.919 --> 00:45:23.114
SAM: He's schvitzing. I mean it's not even humid
in here. (whispering) He's got a problem.

00:45:24.444 --> 00:45:32.460
MATT: "About a mile out of the underworks, beneath
the city. Down the underground river pass that our

00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:38.656
"shipments to the Ounterloch and Berleben pass
through, one of my men noticed a strange wall

00:45:38.656 --> 00:45:50.567
"uncovered by time. We sent a team of our best
infiltrators to see what this was about. Within, a

00:45:50.567 --> 00:45:57.074
"purple light, and the promise of ancient spoils
seemed to peek from within. Some sort of abandoned

00:45:57.074 --> 00:46:05.406
"research facility from ages past. Well my
curiosity got the better of me. So we sent the

00:46:05.406 --> 00:46:13.913
"team inward to seek it out. But amongst these few
gold-laden objects that enticed my men-- they are

00:46:13.913 --> 00:46:19.444
"a superstitious lot-- and upon being beset by
series of phantom globes they fled and collapsed

00:46:19.444 --> 00:46:25.880
"the entrance behind them." You see him glare past
you and hear the shifting of a few pieces of armor

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:38.793
as three individuals avert their gaze. (sighs)
"So those fucks have failed. I would like you to

00:46:38.793 --> 00:46:47.011
"return to that site for me. Find a way in. Inquire
within. Seek and seeing as how you are so good at

00:46:47.011 --> 00:46:53.845
"eliminating monstrous beasts, clearing the space
of any dangers, hostile creatures. Return with any

00:46:53.845 --> 00:47:01.913
"of your findings. Do this for me and I will see
that the scent is thrown off you permanently. I'll

00:47:01.913 --> 00:47:04.266
"even let you keep some of the spoils."

00:47:05.726 --> 00:47:11.611
TRAVIS: This is most intriguing. I hope we would
be able to interview your previous compatriots.

00:47:11.611 --> 00:47:14.509
We'd like to know what they saw before, what we
might expect.

00:47:14.509 --> 00:47:17.776
MATT: "Of course. By all means. Do we have a
deal?"

00:47:17.776 --> 00:47:20.684
TRAVIS: To clear our name here in Zadash?

00:47:20.684 --> 00:47:28.636
SAM: How do we know that you can clear our name?
We've proven to you that we're lucky. You know our

00:47:28.636 --> 00:47:31.659
reputation. We don't know anything about you.

00:47:33.729 --> 00:47:42.956
MATT: "Let's say I've lived and worked a solid 15
years orchestrating the seedy underbelly of this

00:47:43.344 --> 00:47:49.720
"entire city. I've never been caught, I've never
been arrested, and I thrive on a pile of gold and

00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:52.225
"riches you can only begin to imagine."

00:47:52.225 --> 00:47:54.208
TALIESIN: I'm beginning to imagine it right now,
actually.

00:47:54.208 --> 00:47:54.798
MATT: "Good."

00:47:54.798 --> 00:47:56.287
TALIESIN: That's very nice.

00:47:56.287 --> 00:47:57.414
LIAM: Insight check.

00:47:57.414 --> 00:47:58.802
MATT: Make an insight check.

00:47:58.802 --> 00:48:02.027
MARISHA: I bet he edubates on that pile of gold.

00:48:02.027 --> 00:48:04.957
(laughter)

00:48:04.957 --> 00:48:06.350
TALIESIN: That is certainly one to grow on.

00:48:06.350 --> 00:48:12.352
LIAM: Not good enough. That's a twelve.

00:48:12.352 --> 00:48:19.515
MATT: I mean, he's a shifty individual being by
nature. But it's hard to get a sense of whether or

00:48:19.515 --> 00:48:21.122
not he would be trying to lie.

00:48:21.122 --> 00:48:22.990
LIAM: Yeah. He's sweating, he must be nervous.

00:48:24.250 --> 00:48:30.600
SAM: If I may, we passed a test for you. Would you
pass one for us?

00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:42.073
MATT: (laughs) "Little one, (laughs) you intrigue
me. Young green-skin, so overtly walking amongst

00:48:42.073 --> 00:48:47.152
"the nobles above, and yet you've kept your throat.
That says a lot about you. Yes, please tell me,

00:48:47.152 --> 00:48:50.088
"what would this trial be, you would ask of The
Gentleman?"

00:48:52.228 --> 00:48:55.914
SAM: May I have three of those vials? Just the
empty ones.

00:48:59.454 --> 00:49:04.179
MATT: "Cree." Fumbles in the pouch and brings out
three of the empty glass vials, and hands them

00:49:04.179 --> 00:49:04.722
over to you.

00:49:06.462 --> 00:49:12.205
SAM: If I were to fill two of these vials with
ordinary alcohol and one with something else,

00:49:12.205 --> 00:49:19.651
would you be able to tell which is which? With
your discerning eye and your years of experience?

00:49:23.731 --> 00:49:29.255
MATT: "Hmm. Certainly, I feel confident."

00:49:30.225 --> 00:49:31.520
MARISHA: Take the Pepsi challenge.

00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:41.744
SAM: I'll take out my shitty flask, as my good one
is gone. Fill two vials with alcohol and then take

00:49:41.744 --> 00:49:48.038
out my vial of acid and pour it into the third.
Are they reasonably the same colorish?

00:49:49.728 --> 00:49:56.268
MATT: Reasonably. I'd say the alcohol is a bit
more brackish. The acid itself is a little more

00:49:56.268 --> 00:49:59.658
translucent, but you could possibly add a little
bit of alcohol to it.

00:49:59.658 --> 00:50:05.380
SAM: All right, I'll take a little splash of
alcohol and some darker stuff and mix it around.

00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:09.131
MATT: You're an alchemist, you've dealt with
varying chemicals. So I'd say, given a moment, you

00:50:09.131 --> 00:50:11.595
could go ahead and match it fairly close, sure.

00:50:12.475 --> 00:50:20.669
SAM: All right, this one is the acid; these two
are booze. And now I will try to (rapid movement)--

00:50:22.490 --> 00:50:24.350
TALIESIN: Doesn't actually switch hands, you just
do this a lot.

00:50:25.210 --> 00:50:28.397
LIAM: Never mess with a goblin when death is on
the line!

00:50:28.397 --> 00:50:31.585
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check versus his
perception.

00:50:31.585 --> 00:50:34.331
TRAVIS: You're going to kill The Gentleman.

00:50:36.881 --> 00:50:37.648
SAM: 15.

00:50:38.458 --> 00:50:39.322
MATT: 15 total?

00:50:39.322 --> 00:50:40.384
SAM: Yes.

00:50:40.384 --> 00:50:42.380
MATT: All right, you present the vials.

00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:45.401
SAM: If you die, I'm sorry.

00:50:45.401 --> 00:50:59.992
MATT: (chuckles) "This one is alcohol. This one is
alcohol. This one is acid." And takes the acid

00:50:59.992 --> 00:51:03.139
from your grasp and uncorks it and drinks it.

00:51:03.139 --> 00:51:05.709
SAM: Ooh shit, that's baller!

00:51:07.719 --> 00:51:09.725
MATT: So roll the damage for your acid.

00:51:10.475 --> 00:51:11.887
MARISHA: Some Inigo Montoya shit.

00:51:11.887 --> 00:51:15.180
SAM: I don't know what to roll. It's 1d6 or
something. What do I-- I got to look.

00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:17.020
MATT: It should be on your break down of your--

00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:19.288
SAM: It's here. Acid vial.

00:51:19.288 --> 00:51:20.241
ASHLEY: He's awesome.

00:51:20.241 --> 00:51:20.994
MATT: I have it here actually.

00:51:20.994 --> 00:51:22.494
SAM: 2d6.

00:51:22.494 --> 00:51:23.772
MATT: So yeah, roll 2d6.

00:51:23.772 --> 00:51:25.434
TALIESIN: That is so baller. Oh my god.

00:51:25.434 --> 00:51:25.987
SAM: 11.

00:51:25.987 --> 00:51:32.165
MATT: 11. All right, so he (slight cough)
(grunts) downs it, but it doesn't seem to have as

00:51:32.165 --> 00:51:41.187
much of an effect on him. It looks like it hurt,
and he takes it. The muscles tense a bit, the face

00:51:41.187 --> 00:51:47.481
twitches as it goes down and it burns. But then he
takes the vial and corks it again, rolls it across

00:51:47.481 --> 00:51:53.218
the table. (coughs) "Does that satisfy your
inquiry?"

00:51:54.478 --> 00:52:02.874
SAM: (gulp) (gulp) Yep, yeah, that's good. That
was impressive. I mean, you pass the test, sir.

00:52:02.874 --> 00:52:06.219
MATT: (chuckles) "Good, good. I like it."

00:52:06.219 --> 00:52:11.076
TALIESIN: I will say the only thing that I can
think of that I would want, not even necessarily

00:52:11.076 --> 00:52:15.951
addend to this contract, if we are going to do
this to you; I'm looking to stay on the down low

00:52:15.951 --> 00:52:20.024
in general. If we can agree, even my presence in
this city necessarily is, as far as it's

00:52:20.024 --> 00:52:24.639
concerned, is none of anybody's concern outside
this bar. I would be forever grateful.

00:52:26.469 --> 00:52:28.861
MATT: "We deal well in secrecy, my friend."

00:52:28.861 --> 00:52:29.884
TALIESIN: I figured you would.

00:52:29.884 --> 00:52:30.506
MATT: "Lucien, was it?"

00:52:30.506 --> 00:52:31.546
TALIESIN: Sometimes.

00:52:32.246 --> 00:52:34.083
MATT: (chuckles) "Very well."

00:52:34.083 --> 00:52:38.520
TRAVIS: Sir, I couldn't help but hear that this is
about a mile outside of the city. Is that correct?

00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:39.761
MATT: "Correct."

00:52:39.761 --> 00:52:44.084
TRAVIS: Are you operating on any sort of a
timeline? Might we have a little bit of lenience

00:52:44.084 --> 00:52:45.645
with how quickly we get this dealt with?

00:52:47.245 --> 00:52:52.419
MATT: "The sooner the better, because we can begin
opening that line. We've now two weeks and three

00:52:52.419 --> 00:52:53.565
"shipments lost."

00:52:55.245 --> 00:52:58.728
TRAVIS: I've just had a thought, actually, if you
could help us at the same time, we're trying to

00:52:58.728 --> 00:53:03.626
get a friend of ours out of the city. And (coughs)
recent events seem to have clogged up most entries

00:53:03.626 --> 00:53:08.083
and exits. We have a friend, Horris, that needs to
find his way to a safe spot.

00:53:08.083 --> 00:53:10.914
MARISHA: Kara knows him, real well.

00:53:12.204 --> 00:53:14.090
MATT: "Right, this would be Dolan's partner,
yes?"

00:53:14.090 --> 00:53:14.620
TRAVIS: Indeed.

00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:15.128
MATT: "Hmm."

00:53:15.128 --> 00:53:16.952
TRAVIS: Discretion is appreciated.

00:53:16.952 --> 00:53:23.044
MATT: "We specialize in discretion and specialize
in smuggling. And specialize in people."

00:53:23.044 --> 00:53:23.939
TRAVIS: Figured you might.

00:53:23.939 --> 00:53:31.947
MATT: "So you do this deed, we'll consider it part
of your gift."

00:53:33.207 --> 00:53:36.519
TRAVIS: Outstanding. I think we have a deal, do we
not?

00:53:36.519 --> 00:53:37.124
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:53:38.194 --> 00:53:40.059
LIAM: I find all of this very agreeable.

00:53:41.269 --> 00:53:48.240
MATT: "Good, very good, quiet one. Now we have
access to the tunnels. Of course we'll have to

00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:54.356
"blindfold you to bring you through the underworks
to the tunnel that leads to this underground

00:53:54.356 --> 00:54:00.706
"river, when you decide to leave. Just because
there's a lot of secrets down here, and we're

00:54:00.706 --> 00:54:07.268
"still building our trust. But come back in
whenever you're ready. We'll be happy to escort

00:54:07.268 --> 00:54:08.763
"you and send you on your way."

00:54:09.493 --> 00:54:10.477
TRAVIS: Outstanding.

00:54:10.477 --> 00:54:12.384
ASHLEY: How long do you keep our blood for?

00:54:13.234 --> 00:54:15.358
MATT: "Oh, as long as we have our arrangements."

00:54:15.358 --> 00:54:20.095
ASHLEY: But we get it back when we're done? Or we
decide not to work with you anymore?

00:54:20.095 --> 00:54:29.665
MATT: "If you've proven yourself trustworthy
enough, in the long term, perhaps. But understand

00:54:29.665 --> 00:54:36.406
"that this is just a precaution. Who's to know?
Perhaps things go sour in a few months. I want to

00:54:36.406 --> 00:54:39.784
"make sure you don't double cross me and send the
guard down."

00:54:42.464 --> 00:54:47.013
MARISHA: Does it look like he's speaking from
experience? He's a little twitchy.

00:54:47.013 --> 00:54:47.821
MATT: Make an insight check.

00:54:51.501 --> 00:54:53.994
MARISHA: (grumbling) 14.

00:54:56.494 --> 00:55:02.390
MATT: It's more that he's lived this long by being
careful. And when a bunch of strangers find this

00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:10.857
secret pass into his lair, he wants to be damn
well sure that he knows where to find you if need be.

00:55:11.717 --> 00:55:12.661
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:55:14.491 --> 00:55:16.190
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: Fair enough.

00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:21.840
TALIESIN: Remember, the name Lucien doesn't leave
this bar. Outside, I never want to hear it uttered.

00:55:21.847 --> 00:55:24.074
MATT: "I don't know who any of you are outside
this bar."

00:55:24.074 --> 00:55:24.520
TALIESIN: Brilliant.

00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:31.762
MATT: "Don't worry. Anyway," and he throws his
feet back up on the table . "Drinks are on me,

00:55:31.762 --> 00:55:32.857
"until you make your leave."

00:55:32.857 --> 00:55:35.917
TRAVIS: Fantastic! Nott, pace yourself now, you
hear?

00:55:36.418 --> 00:55:39.858
SAM: (growling) (nervous humming)

00:55:39.858 --> 00:55:42.744
TALIESIN: Quality, not quantity.

00:55:42.744 --> 00:55:47.247
TRAVIS: Is that goliath wielding any sort of
visible weapon?

00:55:48.217 --> 00:55:52.849
MATT: At the moment, it does not appear there's a
weapon immediately on the goliath, but as you look

00:55:52.849 --> 00:55:59.229
behind, in the corner right behind the chair where
The Gentleman sits, there looks to be one

00:55:59.229 --> 00:56:10.117
hefty-ass maul. A giant chunk of solid metal with
a long handle on it that is resting against the stone.

00:56:10.117 --> 00:56:12.918
TRAVIS: Ogre and the goliath mauls each. Fuck.

00:56:14.198 --> 00:56:15.492
MATT: They like to break things.

00:56:15.492 --> 00:56:21.485
MARISHA: Who were the two guys that said that they
passed out trying to get away from the creepy,

00:56:21.485 --> 00:56:22.208
ancient facility?

00:56:22.208 --> 00:56:24.210
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, they were armored behind us?

00:56:24.730 --> 00:56:30.576
MATT: Yeah, there's three guys. There's the bar in
the chamber. Next to that, to the right of the

00:56:30.576 --> 00:56:38.111
actual bar, there's a doorway that opens up into a
storeroom. It's underneath the top balcony.

00:56:38.111 --> 00:56:42.920
Underneath the balcony, right next to where the
ogre is posting watch in the center of the tavern,

00:56:42.920 --> 00:56:48.109
the three of them are sitting off to the side,
looking uncomfortable. They were sitting earlier,

00:56:48.109 --> 00:56:51.204
and since all of this happened they stood to
attention and haven't found a comfortable moment

00:56:51.204 --> 00:56:51.854
to sit down.

00:56:51.854 --> 00:56:55.549
MARISHA: Just shifty, rogue-y underbelly types?

00:56:55.549 --> 00:57:00.161
MATT: Yeah. You look over and you see two of them
appear to be human. Relatively young, probably mid

00:57:00.161 --> 00:57:06.696
to late 20s. Scruffy-looking. One of them has a
darker, fro-y hair that's unkempt and covering

00:57:06.696 --> 00:57:14.272
part of his face. The other one has very short
cut hair, dark complexion, brown red. They're

00:57:14.272 --> 00:57:19.691
both wearing darker leathers and cloaks that are
thrown over one shoulder. They're holding tankards

00:57:20.035 --> 00:57:22.588
in their hand and they're both talking amongst
each other while keeping an eye on you.

00:57:22.588 --> 00:57:26.096
TRAVIS: That group looks like your type. Feel like
making friends?

00:57:27.516 --> 00:57:28.975
MARISHA: My favorite pastime.

00:57:28.975 --> 00:57:35.297
MATT: The third one appears to be a halfling
female who is sitting in a corner, quietly

00:57:35.309 --> 00:57:38.618
sipping out of the tankard and looking nervously
around.

00:57:38.618 --> 00:57:40.112
MARISHA: Want to accompany me?

00:57:40.112 --> 00:57:41.485
TRAVIS: I would love to.

00:57:41.485 --> 00:57:42.696
MARISHA: Let's go.

00:57:42.696 --> 00:57:44.955
MATT: Just the two of you approaching?

00:57:44.955 --> 00:57:46.411
MARISHA: Sure. Anyone else wants to join.

00:57:46.411 --> 00:57:51.012
TALIESIN: I'm taking a long look at Cree and I
want to see if I see any of the things that I

00:57:51.012 --> 00:57:52.361
expect to see.

00:57:52.361 --> 00:57:55.246
TRAVIS: What do you expect to see there, T?

00:57:55.293 --> 00:57:56.763
SAM: You know. Dander.

00:57:56.763 --> 00:58:01.836
TALIESIN: I want to see if there's any markings
or anything otherwise that I would expect to see.

00:58:01.893 --> 00:58:03.726
MATT: Oh. Make a perception check.

00:58:03.726 --> 00:58:07.890
TALIESIN: All right.

00:58:07.890 --> 00:58:10.627
SAM: Why are you locking your iPad between every
move?

00:58:10.627 --> 00:58:19.150
TALIESIN: Because it's better that way. Perception
check. Wow, that's a terrible roll. That's a five.

00:58:19.150 --> 00:58:23.029
MATT: A fur-covered tabaxi, it's hard to make any
details out beyond the fur, unfortunately.

00:58:23.029 --> 00:58:24.720
TALIESIN: All right. That's fair.

00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:31.297
MATT: The two of you approach the corner. Kara is
watching you as you step past, and steps back on

00:58:31.317 --> 00:58:33.129
the balcony, out of sight.

00:58:33.129 --> 00:58:36.317
MARISHA: I give her a little (clicks tongue) 
when I walk by.

00:58:36.345 --> 00:58:38.249
MATT: She goes--

00:58:38.249 --> 00:58:41.548
MARISHA: Deal with that later.

00:58:41.548 --> 00:58:43.408
TRAVIS: Yeah, I was going to say the same thing.

00:58:43.408 --> 00:58:49.306
MATT: As you approach the two gentlemen and the
female halfling, they just watch you. They don't

00:58:49.306 --> 00:58:51.595
engage you verbally at all, they just keep an
eye.

00:58:51.595 --> 00:58:57.943
MARISHA: I grab one of the half-drinken beers from
someone else's table and set it down and be like,

00:58:57.943 --> 00:58:59.354
here you go. I got this for you.

00:58:59.354 --> 00:59:00.503
LIAM: That was mine.

00:59:00.503 --> 00:59:02.620
(laughter)

00:59:02.620 --> 00:59:10.946
MATT: He takes it. The guy with the larger curly
hair takes it and pours it into his own and sets

00:59:11.003 --> 00:59:13.277
it back down. "Thank you."

00:59:13.277 --> 00:59:20.970
MARISHA: Heard you guys got all heebie jeebie and
passed out in your last little mission.

00:59:20.997 --> 00:59:23.950
MATT: "Well--" and the other guy elbows him and
he's like, (whispering) "Shut up!"

00:59:23.950 --> 00:59:26.733
MARISHA: No, that's cool! We're here to clean up
y'all's shit.

00:59:26.733 --> 00:59:34.692
MATT: "Look, we signed up for this to make quick
money. We're good at moving quickly. We're good at

00:59:34.692 --> 00:59:39.747
"seeing what's worthwhile. We're good at picking
things out. We're not good at dealing with spooky

00:59:39.747 --> 00:59:48.129
"fucking undead ghost things, okay? We went in, we
went through this path. We found a crack in the

00:59:48.174 --> 00:59:53.022
"wall. We kicked it down. We went inside. There was
a staircase. Went up and down. Went downstairs, it

00:59:53.022 --> 00:59:57.859
"seemed empty. It was confusing. We didn't see
anything of interest. Went upstairs the

00:59:57.859 --> 01:00:02.489
"staircase-- the little spiral staircase-- and
there was a much larger chamber. We started

01:00:02.489 --> 01:00:06.158
"looking around for anything worthwhile. It looked
like it got picked clean long ago. Dust

01:00:06.158 --> 01:00:12.923
"everywhere. The more we began to look, there was
this cold temperature in the room, and eventually

01:00:12.923 --> 01:00:21.849
"these little lights began to come out of the wall.
At first, we were curious by them. One of them got

01:00:21.849 --> 01:00:28.719
"really close to Therad over there. He suddenly
shocked in a serious jolt." And you see him on the

01:00:28.719 --> 01:00:34.602
back, looking a bit spooked, recalling the story.
He goes, "We knew then, these-- whatever the fuck these

01:00:34.602 --> 01:00:41.079
"things were-- they weren't friends of ours. So we got
our shit and we ran. We had a small explosive, so

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:45.076
"we threw it behind us to collapse the wall, hoping
that at least it would slow them down. We

01:00:45.076 --> 01:00:48.877
"realized, in hindsight, that it was pretty stupid
because, if they were spectral enough to come out

01:00:48.877 --> 01:00:53.053
"of the walls, they still could have followed us.
We got up the river from there. We got our boats

01:00:53.053 --> 01:00:54.573
"and made our way back."

01:00:54.573 --> 01:01:00.652
TRAVIS: Let me get this straight. A bunch of
fucking floating lights came out of the wall, gave

01:01:00.652 --> 01:01:03.834
your boy a little static shock, and you ran?

01:01:03.834 --> 01:01:12.033
MATT: They both look at each other and look at the
halfling. The halfling's like, "I wasn't going to

01:01:12.033 --> 01:01:13.420
"stay behind!"

01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:19.201
TRAVIS: Yeah. Well, they're calling in the big
leaguers now, so we'll take it from here. Your way

01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:24.088
up and down those stairs you mentioned, you get
tripped up along the way, or was it just easy sailing?

01:01:24.088 --> 01:01:25.466
MARISHA: Any traps?

01:01:25.466 --> 01:01:31.079
MATT: "We didn't go into the bottom chamber. That
looked ominous enough. We stuck to the top one."

01:01:31.079 --> 01:01:32.298
MARISHA: What?

01:01:32.298 --> 01:01:33.898
TRAVIS: What about it was ominous?

01:01:33.898 --> 01:01:39.958
MATT: "It's just a big octagonal dome chamber.
Had this faint purple-ish glow on the inside-- "

01:01:39.958 --> 01:01:42.117
MARISHA: Are you afraid of geometry? I don't--

01:01:42.117 --> 01:01:44.153
TRAVIS: Yeah. Scared of school.

01:01:44.153 --> 01:01:45.372
MARISHA: Yeah, sure.

01:01:45.372 --> 01:01:46.399
TRAVIS: Yeah. Old terrors.

01:01:46.399 --> 01:01:50.598
MATT: "Look, you can come by and sass me all you
fucking want. I've been here for two years. You

01:01:50.598 --> 01:01:54.967
"newcomers walk in here and think you're all tough
shit! You think it's so great? Go! Go in there!

01:01:54.967 --> 01:01:56.473
"Come back!"

01:01:56.473 --> 01:02:01.207
SAM: Trying to throw it in the garbage, but it hit
your balloon.

01:02:01.207 --> 01:02:05.478
MARISHA: I saw the whole--

01:02:05.478 --> 01:02:06.961
LIAM: Still a game.

01:02:06.961 --> 01:02:10.532
MATT: "You think you're tough shit? You go take
care of it."

01:02:10.532 --> 01:02:14.952
TRAVIS: I appreciate your passion. I don't think
you're in great favor in this room, at the moment.

01:02:14.952 --> 01:02:20.385
You see that really tall woman over there with
that big greatsword on her back? She doesn't

01:02:20.385 --> 01:02:22.361
appreciate when people talk to us like that.

01:02:22.361 --> 01:02:24.548
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

01:02:24.548 --> 01:02:26.470
ASHLEY: Do I see him point at me?

01:02:26.470 --> 01:02:28.272
LIAM: Flex.

01:02:28.272 --> 01:02:32.921
TRAVIS: 13.

01:02:32.921 --> 01:02:33.896
MATT: 13?

01:02:33.896 --> 01:02:36.741
TRAVIS: No, 15. Sorry.

01:02:36.741 --> 01:02:43.247
MATT: 15. He's looking over at you. You can see
him swallowing hard.

01:02:43.247 --> 01:02:46.140
ASHLEY: I put my hand on my hilt and I pull it out
a little bit.

01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:50.718
MATT: "Hey, no, I understand that. That's great.
Looks like you guys are much more well-equipped

01:02:50.718 --> 01:02:54.649
"for this shit than we are. Look, I'm not saying
we're better than you. We're better at some

01:02:54.649 --> 01:02:57.392
"things. You're better at others. That's why
they're sending you in, because we can't fight

01:02:57.443 --> 01:02:58.916
"fucking ghosts. You go for it!"

01:02:58.916 --> 01:03:04.476
MARISHA: We're just giving you a hard time, man.
It's fun. The whole time this was happening, I was

01:03:04.476 --> 01:03:08.283
rubbing my feet against the ground, building
up a static shock.

01:03:08.398 --> 01:03:09.919
MATT: It's stone, but sure.

01:03:09.919 --> 01:03:12.121
(laughter)

01:03:12.121 --> 01:03:15.344
MARISHA: Okay, rubbing against Fjord. Like this.

01:03:15.344 --> 01:03:17.694
TRAVIS: My shag armor.

01:03:17.694 --> 01:03:20.584
MARISHA: Just waiting for it. All right, thank you
so much, man.

01:03:20.584 --> 01:03:21.929
MATT: "All right."

01:03:21.929 --> 01:03:25.854
MARISHA: All right, good. (laughter) Sorry, can't
help it.

01:03:25.854 --> 01:03:27.830
TRAVIS: Did you three have a name?

01:03:27.830 --> 01:03:34.102
LIAM: The Mighty <i>Drei</i>.

01:03:34.102 --> 01:03:37.182
TRAVIS: Don't be ashamed if you don't.

01:03:37.182 --> 01:03:48.765
MATT: The guy who's talking to you says, "That's
Hannah there. I'm Louis." He pauses for a moment,

01:03:48.765 --> 01:03:53.982
shakes your hand. "Now go get this thing."

01:03:53.982 --> 01:04:00.978
TRAVIS: Don't worry. We'll clean it up for you.
Enjoy your drinks. Going to join the others.

01:04:00.978 --> 01:04:04.820
TALIESIN: Yasha. Do I deal with this or do I not
deal with this?

01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:06.615
ASHLEY: I think you should deal with this.

01:04:06.615 --> 01:04:08.478
TALIESIN: I don't want to deal with this.

01:04:08.478 --> 01:04:11.793
ASHLEY: Does any of this sound familiar to you
from the past?

01:04:11.793 --> 01:04:16.778
TALIESIN: I hate this. I'm going to stand up, and
walk over to Cree.

01:04:16.778 --> 01:04:22.162
MATT: Okay. Cree is still standing by the bar with
the satchel on. As you stand up and start

01:04:22.162 --> 01:04:23.977
approaching, she smiles.

01:04:23.977 --> 01:04:26.676
TALIESIN: A lifetime ago.

01:04:26.676 --> 01:04:30.079
MATT: "Indeed. I can tell you it's so good to see
you."

01:04:30.079 --> 01:04:39.529
TALIESIN: I have a weird question, and I apologize
for it. The spell I used to get away, it-- I

01:04:39.529 --> 01:04:48.324
wasn't there for as long as you thought I was. I
missed how everything ended in the end. I hate to

01:04:48.324 --> 01:04:55.948
ask, but I was long gone before anything really
started to go down. How did everything end? Can

01:04:55.948 --> 01:04:59.059
you just-- I'll explain why in a moment.

01:04:59.059 --> 01:05:09.623
MATT: "Well, you had acquired the tome with the
ritual spell that you required to attempt to reach

01:05:09.623 --> 01:05:20.362
"the city. That lady-- I don't remember her name.
The spell slinger from the capital. She came and

01:05:20.362 --> 01:05:27.623
"oversaw and performed the ritual for you. I don't
trust those folk, but I trust you, and if you

01:05:27.623 --> 01:05:39.674
"trusted, than that was enough for me. You gave us
a speech. We had a fine meal. We all got ready

01:05:39.674 --> 01:05:41.496
"there in the forest."

01:05:41.496 --> 01:05:42.671
TALIESIN: That's where I lost you, then.

01:05:42.671 --> 01:05:49.896
MATT: "She said it would be hard for us to tell
whether or not it worked at first, but we went and

01:05:49.896 --> 01:05:55.192
"checked, and you were not breathing. For a good
hour, you were not breathing and you had gone

01:05:55.192 --> 01:06:06.250
"cold. We knew then that-- that we had lost you. We
checked, and I'm very attuned to vitals, as you

01:06:06.250 --> 01:06:24.403
"know. There was no heartbeat. So we waited longer.
The sun rose, and nothing. So, as you told us, if

01:06:24.403 --> 01:06:34.838
"anything were to go wrong, we had to get rid of
any sign, any trace. So, not far from the Tomb

01:06:34.838 --> 01:06:45.839
"Taker hideout, we buried you and we went our
separate ways. She took the tome, the mage woman,

01:06:45.839 --> 01:06:49.487
"it was part of the arrangement you had with her."

01:06:49.487 --> 01:07:00.494
TALIESIN: I'm going to have to find her again at
some point. The reason I've stayed quiet-- It was

01:07:00.494 --> 01:07:08.520
never going to work. Somebody was working against
me. I don't know who, but I can't trust anyone. I

01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:14.091
saw how you reacted to seeing me and it was-- I'm
willing to believe it wasn't you who turned. But

01:07:14.091 --> 01:07:20.076
it could have been her, but it could have been one
of us. That's why I need you to keep it quiet. Please.

01:07:20.076 --> 01:07:23.658
MATT: Make a deception check. You're starting to
get in deep into this now.

01:07:23.658 --> 01:07:25.548
TRAVIS: Deception check?

01:07:25.548 --> 01:07:30.051
TALIESIN: 13.

01:07:30.051 --> 01:07:33.258
SAM: Can I wander over and see if I can overhear
anything?

01:07:33.258 --> 01:07:35.356
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:07:35.356 --> 01:07:37.708
SAM: 12.

01:07:37.708 --> 01:07:42.299
MATT: You start wandering over, but there's too
much noise and general din in the chamber around

01:07:42.299 --> 01:07:43.726
you to make anything out.

01:07:43.726 --> 01:07:49.564
TALIESIN: There will come a moment when I can tell
you everything, but... It's so complicated. Please

01:07:49.581 --> 01:07:51.432
just keep it quiet for now.

01:07:51.432 --> 01:07:52.431
MATT: "Of course."

01:07:52.431 --> 01:07:55.894
TALIESIN: Until I know that everyone's going to
react the way that you did to seeing me.

01:07:55.894 --> 01:07:59.932
MATT: "Right, of course, Lucien."

01:07:59.932 --> 01:08:03.475
TALIESIN: I will tell you everything eventually.

01:08:03.475 --> 01:08:05.619
MATT: "Please, please do."

01:08:05.619 --> 01:08:08.427
TALIESIN: I give a hug.

01:08:08.427 --> 01:08:13.061
MATT: There's a moment pause, and then Cree takes
in the hug too.

01:08:13.061 --> 01:08:16.124
TALIESIN: It's been too long.

01:08:16.124 --> 01:08:21.801
MATT: There's a faint purr in the ear, and then
you hear the voice whisper, "It's good to see you."

01:08:21.801 --> 01:08:27.811
TALIESIN: I'm sorry for everything. And I give the
pat, and head back to the table.

01:08:27.811 --> 01:08:30.513
MATT: "Me too." As you walk away.

01:08:30.513 --> 01:08:35.280
LIAM: While that conversation happens. Can I speak
to you? Just for a second?

01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:36.612
TRAVIS: Of course.

01:08:36.612 --> 01:08:42.084
LIAM: That was a princely sum you just wagered
with there.

01:08:42.084 --> 01:08:45.321
TRAVIS: Yeah. Good thing I won, huh?

01:08:45.321 --> 01:08:52.563
LIAM: Yes, it is. That wouldn't have, by any
chance, have been recompense for everything we did

01:08:52.563 --> 01:08:56.330
the other night? Or are you rolling in it?

01:08:56.330 --> 01:09:00.344
TRAVIS: Am I rolling in it?

01:09:00.344 --> 01:09:07.058
LIAM: Yeah, I'm wondering if you just wagered
the party's funds. On a very calculated risk.

01:09:07.058 --> 01:09:12.170
TRAVIS: Oh. No, I was actually only gambling <i>my</i>
funds.

01:09:12.170 --> 01:09:16.344
LIAM: So you come with funds on you.

01:09:16.344 --> 01:09:17.949
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:09:17.949 --> 01:09:26.893
LIAM: Do you know, I would be all right if you
had? I am a fan of calculated risks.

01:09:26.893 --> 01:09:29.027
TRAVIS: Are you?

01:09:29.027 --> 01:09:34.571
LIAM: Yeah. But it was just, you know-- You're
flush. I understand.

01:09:34.571 --> 01:09:36.435
TRAVIS: At the moment.

01:09:36.435 --> 01:09:37.909
LIAM: Insight check.

01:09:37.909 --> 01:09:39.233
MATT: Make an insight check.

01:09:39.233 --> 01:09:44.629
LIAM: 17.

01:09:44.629 --> 01:09:53.442
TRAVIS: I'm telling the truth. I hadn't even divvied
up that amount from Dolan and everybody else.

01:09:53.442 --> 01:09:55.265
MATT: Yeah. Seems forthright.

01:09:55.265 --> 01:09:56.653
LIAM: All right.

01:09:56.653 --> 01:10:03.194
TRAVIS: Good to know. Calculated risks. I'll keep
that in mind. I thought you liked to play things

01:10:03.194 --> 01:10:04.875
close to the chest.

01:10:04.875 --> 01:10:06.880
LIAM: If the reward is good and it's not stupid.

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:11.022
TRAVIS: Sometimes you got to get a little stupid,
though.

01:10:11.022 --> 01:10:17.951
LIAM: Maybe. Okay.

01:10:17.951 --> 01:10:24.001
TALIESIN: I'm going to walk over with a new round
of drinks. Here, drink this. I'm told they're stupid. Ugh.

01:10:24.001 --> 01:10:30.635
MARISHA: Molly, you have-- Sorry, Lucien.

01:10:30.673 --> 01:10:32.292
TRAVIS: No, that's not it either.

01:10:32.292 --> 01:10:34.759
MARISHA: Sorry, Non--Nongatek.

01:10:34.759 --> 01:10:37.149
TALIESIN: Lucien for the moment. We'll talk about
it later.

01:10:37.149 --> 01:10:39.835
ASHLEY: Would you like us to call you Lucien or do
you want us to call you Molly?

01:10:39.835 --> 01:10:41.353
TALIESIN: In here, we're Lucien.

01:10:41.353 --> 01:10:43.758
LIAM: How many names are there? Is it over ten or
under?

01:10:43.758 --> 01:10:48.528
TALIESIN: Let's have that conversation somewhere
else. I don't know who's listening here.

01:10:48.528 --> 01:10:56.844
MARISHA: She seemed real into you, but not in an
into you like "I want to tap that" kind of into

01:10:56.844 --> 01:11:01.258
you, but in an "I've watched you walk on water"
type of into you.

01:11:01.258 --> 01:11:03.257
TALIESIN: Yeah, that was a weird amount of into
you, wasn't it?

01:11:03.257 --> 01:11:04.506
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:11:04.506 --> 01:11:06.577
TRAVIS: Can you change that alcohol into wine?

01:11:06.577 --> 01:11:14.242
TALIESIN: I'm going to cut my finger a bit and
bleed into it.

01:11:14.242 --> 01:11:16.274
LIAM: With one of your long fingernails?

01:11:16.274 --> 01:11:20.751
MARISHA: Holy shit. You know, to a dumbass, that
actually is convincing.

01:11:20.751 --> 01:11:24.600
TRAVIS: It's alcohol one way or the other. I'll
fucking drink.

01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:27.960
TALIESIN: Is it wine?

01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:34.817
MATT: No, it's bloody water. It's water with a
hint of iron aftertaste.

01:11:34.817 --> 01:11:37.021
TALIESIN: Worth a try.

01:11:37.021 --> 01:11:39.023
LIAM: Write what you know, Taliesin.

01:11:39.023 --> 01:11:42.966
TRAVIS: Molly-- Excuse me, Lucien.

01:11:42.966 --> 01:11:44.403
MARISHA: Nantucket.

01:11:44.403 --> 01:11:50.196
TRAVIS: How many others around here might we
expect to have that same reaction towards you?

01:11:50.196 --> 01:11:52.665
TALIESIN: We will have this conversation outside
this bar.

01:11:52.674 --> 01:11:54.417
MARISHA: This is basically Taliesin at Ren Faire.

01:11:54.417 --> 01:11:56.280
TRAVIS: Yeah!

01:11:56.280 --> 01:12:00.361
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Lord Taliesin!

01:12:00.361 --> 01:12:05.659
LIAM: Taliesin, there's tabaxis coming out of every
stall. What the hell, man?

01:12:05.672 --> 01:12:10.122
TALIESIN: Lucien's not going to answer any
questions. Molly will answer every question you

01:12:10.122 --> 01:12:11.631
have later.

01:12:11.631 --> 01:12:17.958
SAM: If you're not going to answer any questions,
can we please direct some to Yasha over here?

01:12:17.958 --> 01:12:21.710
TALIESIN: Thank you for coming back, I've missed
you.

01:12:21.710 --> 01:12:24.202
SAM: Where were you? Where'd you go? Why did you
leave?

01:12:24.202 --> 01:12:29.242
ASHLEY: Sometimes I have things to do, I barely
know you guys, so sorry if I leave!

01:12:29.242 --> 01:12:31.518
TALIESIN: Why do you need to know so many things?

01:12:31.518 --> 01:12:36.100
TRAVIS: You're not afraid of inclement weather or
anything, are you? It'd been real fair, that

01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:38.349
storm rolled in, and poof, you were fucking gone.

01:12:38.404 --> 01:12:45.351
SAM: She left us before we were ambushed in
Alfield, and when she left us this time, we almost

01:12:45.351 --> 01:12:52.633
died in this plot to overthrow the empire, or
whatever it was with Crick soldiers. Maybe it's

01:12:52.633 --> 01:12:53.817
related!

01:12:53.817 --> 01:12:56.462
ASHLEY: Pretty shit luck for you, then. That has
nothing to do with me.

01:12:56.462 --> 01:13:00.775
MARISHA: I respect a woman who can handle her
business on her own personal time.

01:13:00.775 --> 01:13:11.418
ASHLEY: Thank you very much, Beau. Thank you.
Sometimes I need to leave. Plus, I barely know you guys.

01:13:11.418 --> 01:13:13.730
TALIESIN: They're not used to you yet.

01:13:13.730 --> 01:13:18.190
LIAM: That is true. Do you think you will be able
to travel with us for a little while, perhaps?

01:13:18.190 --> 01:13:19.706
MARISHA: Yeah, get to know us?

01:13:19.706 --> 01:13:21.922
TALIESIN: I could use a hand for a bit.

01:13:21.922 --> 01:13:23.637
ASHLEY: We'll see.

01:13:23.637 --> 01:13:25.083
TALIESIN: I'd owe you one.

01:13:25.083 --> 01:13:26.839
TRAVIS: Did you handle what you needed to handle?

01:13:26.839 --> 01:13:35.368
ASHLEY: I think I did. I think I'm looking for
answers for something, and I don't know if I

01:13:35.368 --> 01:13:39.454
received any more, but I'm still looking.

01:13:39.454 --> 01:13:42.894
SAM: If you told us what it was, we could help
you.

01:13:42.894 --> 01:13:45.129
ASHLEY: I don't know if you can.

01:13:45.129 --> 01:13:49.180
LIAM: No pressure, at all, but it is nice to have
some muscle around.

01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:52.555
SAM: Lots of pressure! Maximum amount of
pressure!

01:13:52.555 --> 01:13:59.472
ASHLEY: Thank you, Nott. I'll stick around and
offer my strength as much as I can.

01:13:59.472 --> 01:14:01.840
LIAM: She is just joshing you.

01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:04.012
SAM: I am not!

01:14:04.012 --> 01:14:05.643
TALIESIN: She is definitely not joshing.

01:14:05.643 --> 01:14:08.221
TRAVIS: I make sure Nott's drink is full all the
time.

01:14:08.221 --> 01:14:13.902
(laughter)

01:14:13.902 --> 01:14:21.062
TRAVIS: Can I look around this unsavory place?
There are no faces that I recognize, right?

01:14:21.062 --> 01:14:28.280
MATT: Glancing around, no. Other than Kara, who
you had spoken with previously, nobody else

01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:29.705
catches your attention.

01:14:29.705 --> 01:14:33.261
MARISHA: What is she doing right now? She still
watching us?

01:14:33.261 --> 01:14:37.746
MATT: No, she's not watching you. She's receded
into the top balcony into a chamber behind.

01:14:37.746 --> 01:14:47.595
SAM: It seemed like the Gentleman-- who's very
impressive, by the way-- knows a lot about stuff,

01:14:47.595 --> 01:14:54.217
including the fact that we were involved in a plot
to frame the Sutan fellow.

01:14:54.217 --> 01:14:57.032
MARISHA: He knows Kara pretty well.

01:14:57.032 --> 01:15:05.126
SAM: Do you think he would know if the Xhorhas
invasion at the same time as our little plan was a

01:15:05.126 --> 01:15:09.990
bigger conspiracy? Were we set up?

01:15:09.990 --> 01:15:12.302
TALIESIN: Why would we be set up?

01:15:12.302 --> 01:15:17.690
SAM: I don't know, but it seems coinky-dinky that
we were there on a night when towers were

01:15:17.690 --> 01:15:18.871
exploding.

01:15:18.871 --> 01:15:23.474
MARISHA: I think we should talk to Kara. I've been
playing hard to get, waiting to see if she mingles

01:15:23.474 --> 01:15:25.064
around to us.

01:15:25.064 --> 01:15:27.592
SAM: You're so coy.

01:15:27.592 --> 01:15:30.633
TRAVIS: I think Kara's the way to go. We start
asking him questions about something that big,

01:15:30.633 --> 01:15:32.828
maybe he won't like us poking our nose around.

01:15:32.828 --> 01:15:35.852
TALIESIN: We'll check, but shit happens, and
you've got to be doing something when shit

01:15:35.852 --> 01:15:37.870
happens. We just happened to be doing something.

01:15:37.870 --> 01:15:39.468
TRAVIS: When shit happened.

01:15:39.468 --> 01:15:41.066
TALIESIN: It's hardly a coincidence.

01:15:41.066 --> 01:15:43.674
ASHLEY: You guys are going to Xhorhas?

01:15:43.674 --> 01:15:49.582
TRAVIS: No. There was a bit of a beatdown the
other night in the Tri-Spire. One of the towers

01:15:49.582 --> 01:15:50.738
was attacked.

01:15:50.738 --> 01:15:52.071
MARISHA: Oh yeah. When did you get in town?

01:15:52.071 --> 01:15:53.064
ASHLEY: I saw that.

01:15:53.064 --> 01:15:54.088
TRAVIS and MARISHA: You were here?

01:15:54.088 --> 01:15:55.563
ASHLEY: I was here. I've been here the whole
time.

01:15:55.563 --> 01:15:56.981
MARISHA: What were you up to?

01:15:56.981 --> 01:15:59.256
ASHLEY: I was trying to figure some shit out.

01:15:59.256 --> 01:16:00.822
SAM: What was it?!

01:16:00.822 --> 01:16:05.783
TALIESIN: What we commonly referred to in the
circus as "Yasha-ing."

01:16:05.783 --> 01:16:07.731
TRAVIS: Oh, Yasha-ing.

01:16:07.731 --> 01:16:13.634
ASHLEY: I like to get away from things sometimes.

01:16:13.634 --> 01:16:16.454
LIAM: We have been getting our hands dirty, a
little bit. Are you sure you want to get your

01:16:16.454 --> 01:16:17.695
hands dirty with us?

01:16:17.695 --> 01:16:19.073
ASHLEY: That's all I'd like to do.

01:16:19.073 --> 01:16:21.680
LIAM: That's direct.

01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:24.338
TALIESIN: It's a sight to behold.

01:16:24.338 --> 01:16:28.762
TRAVIS: You want to go talk to Kara before we get
out of here?

01:16:28.762 --> 01:16:31.590
ASHLEY: Wait, what was the Xhorhas bit?

01:16:31.590 --> 01:16:39.657
SAM: Oh, Xhorhas assassins tried to steal a box of
some sort that was a weapon of mass destruction or

01:16:39.657 --> 01:16:45.250
a portal to another dimension or some sort of
fount of energy that powers their race, we have no

01:16:45.303 --> 01:16:52.585
idea, but they stole it, we encountered them in
the sewers, we did not kill the Xhorhas assassin,

01:16:52.585 --> 01:16:56.967
but he was killed shortly thereafter and we stole
his magical dodecahedron.

01:16:56.967 --> 01:16:58.788
TALIESIN: You said that in this bar.

01:16:58.788 --> 01:17:02.510
LIAM: (as Jester) Technically we stole it from the
crownsguard because he took it away, so we stole

01:17:02.510 --> 01:17:03.806
it later.

01:17:03.806 --> 01:17:10.985
TALIESIN: Let's not say anything in here that we
wouldn't want to be circulated.

01:17:10.985 --> 01:17:20.889
SAM: All you need to know is the people from
Xhorhas are dead now. Do you know people from

01:17:20.889 --> 01:17:22.259
Xhorhas?

01:17:22.259 --> 01:17:24.779
ASHLEY: I'm from Xhorhas.

01:17:24.779 --> 01:17:26.368
MARISHA: What?!

01:17:26.368 --> 01:17:28.007
SAM: Who are you?

01:17:28.007 --> 01:17:30.677
TALIESIN: Wait, is that a beer?

01:17:30.677 --> 01:17:31.789
SAM: Yes.

01:17:31.789 --> 01:17:37.766
ASHLEY: Probably not where they were from.

01:17:37.766 --> 01:17:44.058
SAM: You're a Cr-- Can I say Crick? Is that okay?
Do I have to be a Crick to say it?

01:17:44.058 --> 01:17:46.465
TALIESIN: She's not a Crick.

01:17:46.465 --> 01:17:48.576
LIAM: Depends on who you're talking to.

01:17:48.576 --> 01:18:00.947
ASHLEY: I don't think I'm where they're from. I'm
more southern parts of Xhorhas.

01:18:00.947 --> 01:18:04.411
SAM: You're from that part of the world?

01:18:04.411 --> 01:18:07.378
ASHLEY: No, I don't know exactly where they were
from. I don't know who they are, I don't know

01:18:07.378 --> 01:18:09.059
anything about them.

01:18:09.059 --> 01:18:13.920
TRAVIS: They came in trying to steal this Beacon,
this glowing beacon, which we still have, but they

01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:15.707
were mighty upset about it.

01:18:15.707 --> 01:18:17.012
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:18:17.012 --> 01:18:19.529
LIAM: How long have you been in the Empire?

01:18:19.529 --> 01:18:22.115
ASHLEY: Make sure that's correct, actually.

01:18:22.115 --> 01:18:24.372
MATT: That is correct.

01:18:24.372 --> 01:18:30.806
SAM: You don't know if you were born there or grew
up there?

01:18:30.806 --> 01:18:34.724
ASHLEY: Yes.

01:18:34.724 --> 01:18:37.954
LIAM: How long have you been here in the Empire?

01:18:37.954 --> 01:18:48.218
ASHLEY: For about-- I don't know, when did I meet
you?

01:18:48.218 --> 01:18:50.859
TALIESIN: God, was it a year and a half ago?

01:18:50.859 --> 01:18:52.059
ASHLEY: Year and a half.

01:18:52.059 --> 01:18:56.492
TALIESIN: Give or take. How many people are
listening in on this clearly right now?

01:18:56.492 --> 01:18:58.931
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:18:58.931 --> 01:19:01.441
MARISHA: I'm doing a scan, see if there's any
wandering eyes.

01:19:01.441 --> 01:19:07.209
TALIESIN: 14. Actually, no, 17, sorry.

01:19:07.209 --> 01:19:14.161
MATT: 17. As is the nature of a seedy underbelly,
there are a lot of individuals who are very

01:19:14.161 --> 01:19:17.589
interested in the newcomers that waltzed in, made
a deal with their boss, and have sat and had a

01:19:17.589 --> 01:19:22.116
drink and are talking all sorts of business. There
are a number of folks that are slowly creeping in.

01:19:22.116 --> 01:19:24.481
TALIESIN: Can we please stop talking in here?

01:19:24.481 --> 01:19:28.517
LIAM: What do you mean, people are listening to
heavy metal GWAR babe, purple guy, and little

01:19:28.517 --> 01:19:30.023
green girl in a doll mask?

01:19:30.023 --> 01:19:33.605
TALIESIN: They are serving us free drinks, of
course they're listening to everything we say.

01:19:33.605 --> 01:19:37.387
Let's retire for the evening.

01:19:37.387 --> 01:19:38.883
SAM: Don't we need to talk to Kara?

01:19:38.883 --> 01:19:40.698
TALIESIN: We can come back and do this tomorrow.

01:19:40.698 --> 01:19:42.836
SAM: No! She's right here today!

01:19:42.836 --> 01:19:47.642
TALIESIN: You talk to Kara, then, but no more
whatever this is.

01:19:47.642 --> 01:19:52.632
TRAVIS: Why, Lucien? You afraid the Myriad will
hear? What's his reaction?

01:19:52.632 --> 01:19:54.857
MARISHA: He definitely had a thing!

01:19:54.857 --> 01:19:57.879
TALIESIN: I am genuinely a little drunk, and
didn't remember who the Myriad were.

01:19:57.879 --> 01:19:59.754
TRAVIS: Do I believe him?

01:19:59.754 --> 01:20:01.445
MATT: Make an insight check.

01:20:01.445 --> 01:20:04.299
TRAVIS: Shit. 11.

01:20:04.299 --> 01:20:10.981
TALIESIN: What am I doing, deception? Ten. So I
have to tell the truth? I have no idea, I'd

01:20:10.981 --> 01:20:14.391
literally forgotten because I'm a little drunk and
I'm really preoccupied right now.

01:20:14.391 --> 01:20:16.138
MATT: You don't have to roll deception if you're
not lying.

01:20:16.138 --> 01:20:17.451
TALIESIN: I know, I was just doing it to fuck with
them.

01:20:17.451 --> 01:20:23.706
LIAM: I'm going to have Frumpkin jump into Nott's
lap and do the (gnawing) on her fingers to keep

01:20:23.706 --> 01:20:24.834
her occupied.

01:20:24.834 --> 01:20:26.724
SAM: Ah! I'll eat you!

01:20:26.724 --> 01:20:29.901
TALIESIN: (angry meowing)

01:20:29.901 --> 01:20:32.460
MARISHA: We go talk to Kara.

01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:34.012
SAM: Do you know Lucien, too?

01:20:34.012 --> 01:20:38.496
MATT: You go through a door, and there is a
switchback stairway that leads to the upper

01:20:38.496 --> 01:20:41.606
balcony area, and as you head up there, it looks
like there's a weapon rack which has a bunch of

01:20:41.606 --> 01:20:45.782
weapons set up. Kara's currently sitting on the
edge of a bench and is sharpening the blades,

01:20:45.782 --> 01:20:56.314
small daggers and stuff, and looks back. "Oh!
Hello." Sets it aside. "Look, I'm sorry, I didn't

01:20:56.314 --> 01:21:00.461
"mean to deceive anyone, but that's my business."

01:21:00.461 --> 01:21:05.568
MARISHA: So you were deceiving us.

01:21:05.568 --> 01:21:09.191
MATT: "I was keeping some things close to my
chest, like I'm sure you do."

01:21:09.191 --> 01:21:16.841
TRAVIS: What's that saying? Be careful of the toes
you step on, they might belong to the ass you got

01:21:16.841 --> 01:21:18.320
to kiss later?

01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:22.003
MARISHA: That's a good one. Have to remember that
one.

01:21:22.003 --> 01:21:27.065
MATT: "Look, I deceived no one, outside of what
you needed to know. We got our business done. I've

01:21:27.065 --> 01:21:29.091
"done nothing wrong."

01:21:29.091 --> 01:21:33.750
MARISHA: How much of this was orchestrated from
the beginning? Were we a distraction for the

01:21:33.750 --> 01:21:35.116
bigger picture?

01:21:35.116 --> 01:21:36.563
MATT: "What do you mean?"

01:21:36.563 --> 01:21:39.184
TRAVIS: The attack on the tower.

01:21:39.184 --> 01:21:44.071
MATT: "Oh, the Crick attack on the tower? No, had
nothing to do with us. We're not going to work

01:21:44.071 --> 01:21:45.657
"with those savage beasts."

01:21:45.657 --> 01:21:47.846
MARISHA: Insight check.

01:21:47.846 --> 01:21:48.913
MATT: Go for it.

01:21:48.913 --> 01:21:50.413
TRAVIS: I was looking at you.

01:21:50.413 --> 01:21:56.081
MARISHA: 21.

01:21:56.081 --> 01:21:59.156
(cheering)

01:21:59.156 --> 01:22:00.884
MARISHA: Bring it to me!

01:22:00.884 --> 01:22:02.742
TRAVIS: Still need a whisper corner.

01:22:02.742 --> 01:22:07.460
LIAM: (singing) Ashley, Ashley's back, Ashley's
back in the game, she's back in the game and she's

01:22:07.511 --> 01:22:12.016
never going back and Blindspot is no more. Well,
maybe it is, we're just not sure, we're waiting to

01:22:12.052 --> 01:22:13.193
find out.

01:22:13.193 --> 01:22:17.910
ASHLEY: (singing) We're waiting to find out, but
I'll be here for a minute now. Back to the game.

01:22:17.961 --> 01:22:22.969
MATT: "That wasn't planned by anyone. If anything,
it might have saved our asses, because it made

01:22:22.969 --> 01:22:31.850
"what you did small potatoes by comparison. I'm
thankful it happened, but look, those things

01:22:31.850 --> 01:22:37.926
"continue to attack us from the eastern border, and
from what little information's coming through,

01:22:37.926 --> 01:22:41.918
"it's getting worse with each passing week, so the
last thing I want to do is let any more of them

01:22:41.918 --> 01:22:43.528
"into our backyard."

01:22:43.528 --> 01:22:50.072
MARISHA: All right. You won't want to frame them
in any type of larger scheme, considering it seems

01:22:50.072 --> 01:22:51.624
like you're quite irritated with them?

01:22:51.624 --> 01:22:59.257
MATT: "Look, I know my limits. I'm not some
mastermind. I want to make some coin, I want to

01:22:59.257 --> 01:23:04.823
"work with one of my skill sets, make the boss
happy. I stay mainly within the city. I don't want

01:23:04.823 --> 01:23:07.957
"to deal with any bigger stuff than that. I'm just
a girl."

01:23:07.957 --> 01:23:11.705
TRAVIS: I'm going to ask you a question you're 
probably not going to give me the truth to. Is your

01:23:11.749 --> 01:23:15.627
relationship with the Gentleman one of a debt or
one of convenience?

01:23:15.641 --> 01:23:28.358
MATT: "It's one of convenience. Keeping it short
for you, it sure beats pickpocketing in the

01:23:28.358 --> 01:23:30.245
"streets and being beaten when I'm caught."

01:23:30.245 --> 01:23:32.254
TRAVIS: I hear that.

01:23:32.254 --> 01:23:34.642
MARISHA: Interesting. How long have you been
working for the Gentleman?

01:23:34.642 --> 01:23:37.780
MATT: "About eight years."

01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:39.324
MARISHA: That's a long time.

01:23:39.324 --> 01:23:40.515
MATT: "I worked my way up."

01:23:40.515 --> 01:23:42.320
MARISHA: Does he feel the same about the
Xhorhasian as you do?

01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:45.222
MATT: "As far as I know, yeah. It's not good for
business."

01:23:45.222 --> 01:23:57.193
MARISHA: You know, it's not as difficult to rally
a society of people against another. It's not too

01:23:57.193 --> 01:23:59.690
hard to start a war if you really want to.

01:23:59.690 --> 01:24:12.316
MATT: "That's true, but-- I don't know his whole
plan, per se, but business works well when things

01:24:12.316 --> 01:24:25.475
"are predictable. Right? And when there's war
involved, things get real unpredictable. Emotions

01:24:25.475 --> 01:24:37.623
"are high. The amount of armed guard and military
gets high. We're forced to skulk in the shadows

01:24:37.623 --> 01:24:43.281
"until it blows over. Last thing we want is for all
this to get any crazier then."

01:24:43.281 --> 01:24:49.326
TRAVIS: I only have one other thing. I was taken
by Dolan's passionate message.

01:24:49.326 --> 01:24:54.528
MATT: "Dolan's a good man. He's not caught up in
all this. Don't try and mix us up in that, right.

01:24:54.528 --> 01:24:56.211
"He doesn't deserve it."

01:24:56.211 --> 01:25:00.878
TRAVIS: All right. Is some of the business that we
can expect going to go against the fair people of

01:25:00.878 --> 01:25:02.089
this city?

01:25:02.089 --> 01:25:11.798
MATT: "Generally, no. Most of the folks that work
with the Gentleman and that we work for are

01:25:11.798 --> 01:25:17.614
"well-paying because they're well-off. Some of them
aren't the most moral, either. We don't do

01:25:17.614 --> 01:25:25.123
"anything that hurts the folk that don't deserve
it. At least from what I know. We don't kill, we

01:25:25.173 --> 01:25:36.446
"don't murder. We just move and sell and deal in
various goods that aren't perfectly legal."

01:25:36.446 --> 01:25:39.913
MARISHA: Did Ulog and Dolan know about your
involvement with the Gentleman?

01:25:39.913 --> 01:25:41.311
MATT: "No."

01:25:41.311 --> 01:25:47.929
MARISHA: All right, here's my question. Ulog was
in against the High-Richter. That was his

01:25:47.929 --> 01:25:53.378
motivation. Dolan wanted to get after Lord Sutan
for running him out of his practice.

01:25:53.378 --> 01:25:54.510
MATT: "Right."

01:25:54.510 --> 01:25:56.966
MARISHA: What did you get out of all this?

01:25:56.966 --> 01:26:06.882
MATT: "Well, if I have a friend that makes it high
in the political chain of the city-- Dolan-- and I

01:26:06.882 --> 01:26:13.515
"have the ear of the Gentleman, that's a mighty
powerful ally to the underworld without that ally

01:26:13.515 --> 01:26:14.790
"knowing."

01:26:14.790 --> 01:26:18.180
TRAVIS: Indeed. That's a connection worth the
trouble.

01:26:18.180 --> 01:26:23.140
MARISHA: You're only in it to be a middleman? No
goals or aspirations yourself?

01:26:23.140 --> 01:26:27.801
MATT: "Well, there's good money in being the
middleman, if this works out. To be honest, it

01:26:27.801 --> 01:26:35.531
"sure beats having to shuffle in the shadows. I
work better in public anyway. It's what I do for

01:26:35.531 --> 01:26:36.779
"the Gentleman now."

01:26:36.779 --> 01:26:41.898
MARISHA: Yeah. You got a nice face. It's good for
presentory purposes.

01:26:41.898 --> 01:26:43.254
TRAVIS: "You got a nice face"?

01:26:43.254 --> 01:26:45.510
MARISHA: She does! Look! She's got a good face!

01:26:45.510 --> 01:26:49.044
TRAVIS: I'm glad you found a place here. It was
good to see you again.

01:26:49.044 --> 01:26:51.558
MATT: "You too. Sorry--"

01:26:51.558 --> 01:26:53.361
MARISHA: That was a compliment. Did it not?

01:26:53.361 --> 01:26:55.036
TRAVIS: If I can't tell, you didn't--

01:26:55.036 --> 01:27:04.501
MARISHA: That was a compliment. All right. Guess
we'll see you around.

01:27:04.501 --> 01:27:11.183
MATT: "Stay safe. You know where to find me, or at
least ask about me, now. Looks like we're in bed

01:27:11.183 --> 01:27:12.731
"one way or the other."

01:27:12.731 --> 01:27:14.487
MARISHA: I mean--

01:27:14.487 --> 01:27:15.598
TRAVIS: Leave that one alone.

01:27:15.598 --> 01:27:16.919
MARISHA: All right. Let's go!

01:27:16.919 --> 01:27:17.983
TRAVIS: We head downstairs.

01:27:17.983 --> 01:27:21.614
MATT: All right. You join up with the rest of the
crew. You guys have all gathered again. What would

01:27:21.614 --> 01:27:25.015
you like to do?

01:27:25.015 --> 01:27:27.108
TALIESIN: Situationally, it could be a thing--

01:27:27.108 --> 01:27:28.614
SAM: I think they're talking about the sword.

01:27:28.614 --> 01:27:30.001
TALIESIN: Yeah, we've been talking about the
sword.

01:27:30.001 --> 01:27:32.078
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, the one that we had for--

01:27:32.078 --> 01:27:33.139
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:27:33.139 --> 01:27:34.915
SAM: Jester has it, doesn't she?

01:27:34.915 --> 01:27:36.089
TALIESIN and TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:27:36.089 --> 01:27:42.705
SAM: Jester, by the way, you seriously-- Your
farts have been disgusting tonight. I've been

01:27:42.705 --> 01:27:47.063
sitting next to you all night , and it's just
<i>foul</i>. Foul.

01:27:47.063 --> 01:27:50.969
TRAVIS: Yeah. Like sprinkles and hard candies.
Just (dry puffing).

01:27:50.969 --> 01:27:54.243
MATT: "That's not me. That is just a gift from
the Traveler."

01:27:54.285 --> 01:27:58.888
TRAVIS: (farting) Her skirt's like, (farting).

01:27:58.888 --> 01:28:02.824
MATT: This is why you don't miss a game, Laura.

01:28:02.824 --> 01:28:04.981
ASHLEY: But she's sick.

01:28:04.981 --> 01:28:06.908
TRAVIS: (singing) I'm on the couch tonight!

01:28:06.908 --> 01:28:09.435
(laughter)

01:28:09.435 --> 01:28:12.670
LIAM: Jester, why are you smearing feces all over
your face?

01:28:12.670 --> 01:28:14.950
TRAVIS: It's wafting over.

01:28:14.950 --> 01:28:17.458
MATT: Anyway.

01:28:17.458 --> 01:28:19.114
TRAVIS: Lucien--

01:28:19.114 --> 01:28:22.722
SAM: We can pass out the sword later, but do you
think it's something you could use?

01:28:22.722 --> 01:28:29.103
MATT: It a dark, graphite-colored blade
that's hooked in places and this gradual sharp. It's a

01:28:29.162 --> 01:28:32.764
longsword, so it's not the beefy thing you're used
to.

01:28:32.764 --> 01:28:33.802
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:28:33.802 --> 01:28:34.898
SAM: What does she wield usually?

01:28:34.898 --> 01:28:36.295
TRAVIS: Greatsword.

01:28:36.295 --> 01:28:37.800
ASHLEY: Moontouched.

01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:41.437
MATT: It is a hefty blade. What you're used to,
this one's a little smaller. It's still helpful,

01:28:41.437 --> 01:28:44.266
but it's your call.

01:28:44.266 --> 01:28:52.849
ASHLEY: I really saved up for the sword that I
have. I thank you guys for thinking of me, but--

01:28:52.849 --> 01:28:55.209
SAM: Could you have it as a backup weapon or
something?

01:28:55.209 --> 01:28:56.932
LIAM: Yeah, you could shoulder that motherfucker.

01:28:56.932 --> 01:28:59.206
SAM: Could you dual wield?

01:28:59.206 --> 01:29:08.067
MATT: I think you could use it with your Hexblade.
You can use it two-handed, do a d10, but that's up

01:29:08.067 --> 01:29:11.286
to you. It's not as hefty or as sentimental as the
one you have.

01:29:11.286 --> 01:29:12.585
ASHLEY: I'll hold on to it.

01:29:12.585 --> 01:29:15.019
TALIESIN: We'll hold on. We'll see if you want to
play around with it, Fjord.

01:29:15.059 --> 01:29:16.854
LIAM: Nott, maybe you could use it. You know, for
laughs.

01:29:16.854 --> 01:29:18.005
SAM: Sure.

01:29:18.005 --> 01:29:20.378
MATT: It's taller than Nott.

01:29:20.378 --> 01:29:22.735
ASHLEY: It's taller than Nott?

01:29:22.735 --> 01:29:24.845
TALIESIN: Yeah. Many things are taller than Nott.

01:29:24.845 --> 01:29:26.679
SAM: I could use it as a makeshift shelter.

01:29:26.679 --> 01:29:28.511
LIAM: You could do the pole vault.

01:29:28.511 --> 01:29:30.143
TALIESIN: Interesting stuff there.

01:29:30.143 --> 01:29:31.650
ASHLEY: What do you think, Fjord?

01:29:31.650 --> 01:29:38.787
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think it's got some potential. Do
you mind if I hold on to it for a bit?

01:29:38.787 --> 01:29:41.525
ASHLEY: No, by all means. I think I'm a bit
attached to my sword.

01:29:41.525 --> 01:29:47.915
SAM: Can I just clock the tabaxi and see where
that satchel with our blood in it is? Did she

01:29:47.915 --> 01:29:49.656
happen to put it down while she was over?

01:29:49.656 --> 01:29:51.569
MATT: No, it is over her shoulder and by her
side.

01:29:51.569 --> 01:29:52.805
LIAM: That's a shame

01:29:52.805 --> 01:29:56.070
ASHLEY: That's a shame, because I wanted to get it
back.

01:29:56.070 --> 01:30:01.439
TRAVIS: Nott, why don't you ask that big ogre by
the door what her name is?

01:30:01.439 --> 01:30:03.075
SAM: Why? Why would I do that?

01:30:03.075 --> 01:30:04.264
TRAVIS: You have such a way with people.

01:30:04.264 --> 01:30:05.635
SAM: I do not.

01:30:05.635 --> 01:30:07.835
TRAVIS: Yeah, you knock down the barriers, you get
right in. Icebreaker.

01:30:07.835 --> 01:30:08.955
SAM: People hate me.

01:30:08.955 --> 01:30:10.102
TRAVIS: No, that's not true at all.

01:30:10.102 --> 01:30:13.126
LIAM: I will go with you, if you want. If you want
us to ask this--

01:30:13.170 --> 01:30:19.935
SAM: There's no part of this that I want! But if
you'd like to go over there, I'll be your second.

01:30:19.935 --> 01:30:21.107
LIAM: To the ogre?

01:30:21.107 --> 01:30:25.519
SAM: Yeah. I'd be comfortable talking to that
little crazy gnome.

01:30:25.519 --> 01:30:27.416
TRAVIS: Always good to make friends with the
doorman. You got to know this.

01:30:27.416 --> 01:30:28.881
TALIESIN: That is a fair point.

01:30:28.881 --> 01:30:31.537
SAM: All right, we can go talk to the ogre.

01:30:31.537 --> 01:30:33.046
TRAVIS: Tell him that joke you know.

01:30:33.046 --> 01:30:37.142
SAM: All right, sure.

01:30:37.142 --> 01:30:38.892
LIAM: Let's go.

01:30:38.892 --> 01:30:41.528
SAM: Can we go by the bar, though?

01:30:41.528 --> 01:30:44.175
LIAM: This is a people-building exercise.

01:30:44.175 --> 01:30:51.566
MATT: To lay it out, the whole room is shaped like
an L. Here's the far end, and this is the chamber.

01:30:51.566 --> 01:30:56.841
You guys entered from this side, around the corner
the ogre's right there. The bar's up here, and

01:30:56.841 --> 01:30:58.657
this is where the Gentleman was.

01:30:58.657 --> 01:31:04.304
SAM: Going to swing by the bar, I need a refill.
Going to give the bartender my flask, and say:

01:31:04.304 --> 01:31:06.183
Could you fill this entire thing up?

01:31:06.183 --> 01:31:08.337
MATT: "Yeah, no problem. Boss said it's fine."

01:31:08.337 --> 01:31:12.262
LIAM: He's good, pouring a flask like that.

01:31:12.262 --> 01:31:13.682
SAM: Thank you.

01:31:13.682 --> 01:31:16.581
MATT: He has practice. It's a little spilled. It's
a little messy.

01:31:16.581 --> 01:31:18.317
SAM: I don't tip.

01:31:18.317 --> 01:31:22.075
(laughter)

01:31:22.075 --> 01:31:24.592
TRAVIS: Character choice!

01:31:24.592 --> 01:31:31.587
LIAM: Important note: Laura Bailey has texted in
that she hates us all.

01:31:31.587 --> 01:31:38.017
SAM: We'll go over to the ogre, I guess?

01:31:38.017 --> 01:31:40.850
LIAM: Sure. This is easy. We're all going to die.

01:31:40.850 --> 01:31:43.775
MATT: You approach the ogre?

01:31:43.775 --> 01:31:45.034
LIAM: Yeah.

01:31:45.034 --> 01:31:48.901
MATT: The ogre, who's standing roughly ten, 11
feet tall.

01:31:48.901 --> 01:31:53.086
LIAM: This is a guy, it is a male ogre?

01:31:53.086 --> 01:32:00.918
MATT: It is a male ogre, wearing patchwork hides
and fur over one shoulder, large belly, rippling

01:32:00.918 --> 01:32:09.501
muscle arms, the maul held in one hand, resting
against the chest. Deep, angry jaw that has jowls

01:32:09.501 --> 01:32:15.363
that swing as it turns its head to look towards
you. Both the eyes are dark and beady, with a

01:32:15.363 --> 01:32:20.809
brown iris you can barely see under the folded
brow. As you approach, it (snorts).

01:32:20.809 --> 01:32:27.702
LIAM: I also grab Jester by the wrist and drag her
along, because she makes everyone smile, so I

01:32:27.702 --> 01:32:39.122
bring her with. Yeah, hello. I am sorry to bother
you, but I think that we are loosely connected

01:32:39.122 --> 01:32:48.416
through work relations now. This is my friend
Nott, this is Jester. My name is Caleb Widogast,

01:32:48.416 --> 01:32:53.687
and we are working for the Gentleman, much like
you are. We are going to be here--

01:32:53.687 --> 01:33:00.076
SAM: What do you call a deer with no eyes? No eye
deer!

01:33:00.076 --> 01:33:04.611
(laughter)

01:33:04.611 --> 01:33:06.324
TRAVIS: Come on.

01:33:06.324 --> 01:33:09.318
MARISHA: No, that's great.

01:33:09.318 --> 01:33:11.116
MATT: (confused grunt)

01:33:11.116 --> 01:33:12.015
TRAVIS: Oh no.

01:33:12.015 --> 01:33:13.304
SAM: It didn't work.

01:33:13.304 --> 01:33:18.444
MATT: Literally rolled an intelligence check to
see if he got it. And did not.

01:33:18.444 --> 01:33:23.370
LIAM: You know, we don't want to take up too much
of your time, I was just hoping to learn two

01:33:23.370 --> 01:33:27.448
things. One, what is your name?

01:33:27.448 --> 01:33:31.293
MATT: "Kutha."

01:33:31.293 --> 01:33:38.918
LIAM: I wipe the warm breath off of my face.

01:33:38.918 --> 01:33:40.889
TRAVIS: Kutha.

01:33:40.889 --> 01:33:47.958
LIAM: And my second question is: do you like
working for the Gentleman?

01:33:47.958 --> 01:33:51.400
MATT: "Yeah."

01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:56.024
TALIESIN: I've been informed by Jester that she is
now to use the Wand of Smiles.

01:33:56.024 --> 01:34:00.684
(cheering)

01:34:00.684 --> 01:34:03.846
TRAVIS: What is it?

01:34:03.846 --> 01:34:12.219
(laughter)

01:34:12.219 --> 01:34:13.707
TALIESIN: From the darkness, she strikes!

01:34:13.707 --> 01:34:17.921
SAM: It looks so painful!

01:34:17.921 --> 01:34:26.263
MATT: "What's happening?" (grunting) Clawing at the
jaw, trying to pull it down.

01:34:26.263 --> 01:34:29.939
LIAM: I will take that as a yes. I am glad we are
doing business with this gentleman.

01:34:29.939 --> 01:34:32.011
SAM: Good to meet you.

01:34:32.011 --> 01:34:36.744
MATT: (groaning) "You do this?!"

01:34:36.744 --> 01:34:43.404
SAM: No, it wasn't me! I didn't do anything! Let's
go!

01:34:43.404 --> 01:34:44.713
TRAVIS: We should go.

01:34:44.713 --> 01:34:52.128
MATT: This terrible grinning ogre, who seems
confused with the facial muscles not functioning.

01:34:52.128 --> 01:34:54.006
TRAVIS: We go up the stairs and out.

01:34:54.006 --> 01:34:57.671
MARISHA: You guys made friends. Good job.

01:34:57.671 --> 01:34:59.917
TRAVIS: Kuthag? Or Kuth--

01:34:59.917 --> 01:35:02.774
MATT: Kutha. K-U-T-H-A.

01:35:02.774 --> 01:35:03.972
LIAM: Kutha.

01:35:03.972 --> 01:35:09.987
MATT: Kutha. You guys make your way back up the
spiral staircase, out through the trapdoor in the

01:35:09.987 --> 01:35:14.920
back storage room of the Evening Nip, exiting past
the bar where Clive Binz sits there waiting with

01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:20.692
his half burn-scarred dwarven face, who gives you
a nod as you exit back into the city-- now, I

01:35:20.692 --> 01:35:26.037
believe, in the late-afternoon, near dusk-- the sky
grows darker as you proceed onto the next leg of

01:35:26.037 --> 01:35:27.775
your adventure. And that's where we're going to
take a break.

01:35:27.775 --> 01:35:29.855
(cheering)

01:35:29.855 --> 01:35:33.634
MATT: We'll be back here in a few moments, guys.
Please stick around; we have a great little video

01:35:33.634 --> 01:35:37.903
at 826 that I think you want to check out to let
you know about the-- It's awesome, a bunch of us

01:35:37.903 --> 01:35:39.355
went down there and I hope helped--

01:35:39.355 --> 01:35:42.305
LIAM: We had the loveliest time, it was a great
day; please check it out.

01:35:42.406 --> 01:35:44.963
MATT: We get to go back again on Saturday to
finish up our campaign for those kids, it's going

01:35:44.963 --> 01:35:50.718
to be exciting. We have our Wyrmwood giveaway, of
course, for you folks out there. Those of you who

01:35:50.718 --> 01:35:57.496
want to come over into Twitch chat to enter, the
code for tonight is "gentleman"-- "A", singular,

01:35:57.496 --> 01:36:02.922
"gentleman"! Gentle<i>man</i>, not <i>men</i>. You can only
enter it once in the chat, any more than that and

01:36:02.922 --> 01:36:07.319
you'll be disqualified. This is good for anyone in
the United States, Canada, excluding Quebec,

01:36:07.319 --> 01:36:14.077
unfortunately, due to crazy rules and laws. But
here you have this fancy zebrawood deck box, which

01:36:14.077 --> 01:36:18.277
is nice material that we're all going to be
signing and sending out, so we'll come back from

01:36:18.277 --> 01:36:21.808
the break with the winner. Until then, hang tight,
enjoy the break, and we'll see you here in a few

01:36:21.808 --> 01:36:22.921
minutes.

01:36:22.921 --> 01:36:29.519
MARISHA: Hello, Critters! We are back at the Time
Travel Mart in Echo Park, California, which is one

01:36:29.519 --> 01:36:34.910
of the homes of our beloved 826LA, and we're going
to tell you about this amazing organization and

01:36:34.910 --> 01:36:38.778
maybe play some Dungeons &amp; Dragons? Come on, I'll
show you around.

01:36:38.778 --> 01:37:17.280
[funky music]

01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:23.750
MARISHA: You all probably remember this guy, Joel,
the executive director from 826LA. Thank you so

01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:28.456
much for having us and talking to us once again.
We've been doing this a few years now.

01:37:28.456 --> 01:37:33.315
JOEL: I think this is our third or fourth time
together and I really appreciate the incredible

01:37:33.315 --> 01:37:35.125
support you've given us over the years, so thank
you.

01:37:35.125 --> 01:37:40.853
MARISHA: Yeah, aren't the Critters such an amazing
group? We've heard rumors of people coming and

01:37:40.853 --> 01:37:42.386
stopping by and volunteering, yeah?

01:37:42.386 --> 01:37:47.301
JOEL: Yeah, they're an incredibly generous group,
and we've had volunteer orientations a few times a

01:37:47.301 --> 01:37:53.320
month, and there's always a good ten folks who show
up, and when we ask them, "How did you hear about

01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:56.923
"us?" they talk about your show, and it's been a
huge help to us.

01:37:56.923 --> 01:38:01.969
MARISHA: Oh my goodness, that warms my heart so
much. I love it. Okay, so give us a little bit of

01:38:01.969 --> 01:38:07.914
a rundown on what 826 is, and what you guys do for
all the amazing kids that come through here.

01:38:07.914 --> 01:38:12.037
JOEL: We're a writing and tutoring organization.
We really want to get kids excited about writing.

01:38:12.037 --> 01:38:16.696
We want to honor their creativity and give them a
space where they can have fun and engage with

01:38:16.696 --> 01:38:24.103
volunteers who can listen and help guide them in
their storytelling and in their writing. We do

01:38:24.103 --> 01:38:28.983
this after school tutoring, we do night time
tutoring and we do workshops. We also do a field

01:38:28.983 --> 01:38:34.467
trip program, and then we also go into schools all
across Los Angeles to provide this free,

01:38:34.467 --> 01:38:36.414
one-on-one service to kids.

01:38:36.414 --> 01:38:41.424
MARISHA: You guys have 826 chapters all over the
country, correct?

01:38:41.424 --> 01:38:45.754
JOEL: That's right, we're part of 826 National,
which is our umbrella organization out of San

01:38:45.754 --> 01:38:51.831
Francisco. We have chapters in San Francisco, we
have one in New York, in Chicago, D.C., Michigan,

01:38:51.831 --> 01:38:54.228
Detroit. We're actually opening one in New Orleans
very soon.

01:38:54.228 --> 01:38:56.030
MARISHA: (gasps) Hey, NOLA!

01:38:56.030 --> 01:39:00.783
JOEL: NOLA. So we're excited. We're all very
connected and we share resources and support each

01:39:00.783 --> 01:39:06.651
other. We're all independent non-profits in our
cities, but we collaborate and support each other.

01:39:06.651 --> 01:39:12.928
MARISHA: I love it so much. You guys have the Time
Travel Mart, which is amazing, if you're ever in

01:39:12.928 --> 01:39:18.132
Los Angeles, you have to come visit it. You have
different themes for each of those across the

01:39:18.132 --> 01:39:19.184
nation, yeah?

01:39:19.184 --> 01:39:22.566
JOEL: Yeah, so we have actually two Time Travel
Marts here in Los Angeles. We've got the one here

01:39:22.566 --> 01:39:26.954
that we're in Echo Park, and we have one in Mar
Vista, which is from the 1890s-- this one's the

01:39:26.954 --> 01:39:32.854
1980s Time Travel Mart. San Francisco has a pirate
store, New York has a superhero supply store, they

01:39:32.854 --> 01:39:35.821
sell robot supplies in Michigan.

01:39:35.821 --> 01:39:40.203
MARISHA: (laughs) That all feeds right back into
the organization, yeah?

01:39:40.203 --> 01:39:44.946
JOEL: Yeah. All the profit from those sales help
pay for the free services we provide to kids from

01:39:44.946 --> 01:39:46.612
six to 18 years of age.

01:39:46.612 --> 01:39:51.922
MARISHA: How did that even come about? How did you
guys think to do that? It's so brilliant.

01:39:51.922 --> 01:39:56.497
JOEL: Dave Eggers, one of the founders of the
organization, he was working with some volunteers

01:39:56.497 --> 01:40:00.840
at our founding site in San Francisco, and when
they were taking apart the place, somebody said it

01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:06.260
looked like the inside of a pirate ship. So they
decided to build a pirate store in the front. It

01:40:06.260 --> 01:40:11.713
was a joke at first, but people started leaving
money at the counter. They didn't even have a

01:40:11.713 --> 01:40:16.890
person who would take money-- people kept donating
and leaving money, so it became a concept, and all

01:40:16.890 --> 01:40:18.897
the cities now have storefronts.

01:40:18.897 --> 01:40:24.019
MARISHA: Now, if people want to get involved in
826LA or any of the 826's across the country, how

01:40:24.019 --> 01:40:25.827
is the best way to go about doing that?

01:40:25.827 --> 01:40:30.836
JOEL: Well, you can go to our website 826la.org,
and there's a whole section for volunteers where

01:40:30.836 --> 01:40:35.832
you could learn about what it takes to volunteer and
you can sign up for volunteer orientation. All of

01:40:35.832 --> 01:40:40.322
our chapters across the nation have their own
sites, so folks can visit and get involved.

01:40:40.322 --> 01:40:45.511
MARISHA: Awesome. You don't necessarily have to
tutor if that's not your jam. You can do many

01:40:45.511 --> 01:40:46.943
things, right?

01:40:46.943 --> 01:40:50.760
JOEL: Yeah, we don't turn any volunteers away. We
try to figure out ways to get all volunteers

01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:56.490
involved. We need help with design, we need help
with copy editing, we have a ton of projects that

01:40:56.490 --> 01:40:57.783
we could always use help on.

01:40:57.783 --> 01:40:59.525
MARISHA: Amazing. All skill sets are appreciated.

01:40:59.525 --> 01:41:00.650
JOEL: Absolutely.

01:41:00.650 --> 01:41:02.872
MARISHA: Joel, thank you, as always, for taking
the time.

01:41:02.872 --> 01:41:04.205
JOEL: Thank you.

01:41:04.205 --> 01:41:05.319
MARISHA: All right, we'll see you soon.

01:41:05.319 --> 01:41:06.743
JOEL: See you soon.

01:41:06.743 --> 01:41:09.480
MARISHA: All right, here's the deal: we are
dedicating the next four weeks to our favorite

01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:16.315
charity, 826LA. Now, for every 5000 dollars we
raise, a new incentive will be unlocked for

01:41:16.315 --> 01:41:17.625
everyone.

01:41:17.625 --> 01:41:22.484
TALIESIN: For a complete list of those incentives,
head on over to geekandsundry.com.

01:41:22.484 --> 01:41:29.272
LIAM: Additionally, D&amp;D Beyond has offered to
donate $100 for every natural one rolled by the

01:41:29.317 --> 01:41:34.234
Mighty Nein up until June-- including every
natural one rolled to date, making a positive out

01:41:34.234 --> 01:41:35.419
of our misery.

01:41:35.419 --> 01:41:40.469
TRAVIS: And we have an amazing community member
and Critter who has graciously offered to match

01:41:40.469 --> 01:41:46.020
all donations up to $40,000. That means each
dollar that you donate will be doubled.

01:41:46.020 --> 01:41:51.363
MATT: A huge thank you, of course, to our friends
at D&amp;D Beyond, Geek and Sundry, and Wyrmwood for

01:41:51.363 --> 01:41:56.723
being so wonderful to support 826LA and bring joy
to all of these kids. And, of course, we have to

01:41:56.723 --> 01:42:02.338
thank you, the Critters, whose continuous care and
generosity even makes things like this possible.

01:42:02.338 --> 01:42:05.201
So I guess it's time, guys.

01:42:05.201 --> 01:42:11.212
ALL: Let's do this!

01:42:11.212 --> 01:49:05.176
[break]

01:49:05.176 --> 01:49:07.812
MATT: Welcome back. Great timing.

01:49:07.812 --> 01:49:09.360
TRAVIS: They're getting worse.

01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:14.724
MATT: So, we have our winner for the evening for
the Wyrmwood giveaway. It is LoupRouge. LoupRouge,

01:49:14.724 --> 01:49:19.517
congratulations. Danoba will get your information
and we'll get that sent out to you ASAP. So

01:49:19.517 --> 01:49:26.066
congrats! All right, bringing us back into the
game, you guys have all reassembled with a moment

01:49:26.066 --> 01:49:31.710
of your thoughts on the outside of the Evening
Nip, just as the sun has set. The oranges and

01:49:31.710 --> 01:49:35.659
purples of the sky have taken over with the little
bits that you can see beyond the cloud cover that

01:49:35.659 --> 01:49:40.620
still seems to permeate the atmosphere above you.
With the recent storm mostly passed, it seems at

01:49:40.620 --> 01:49:45.810
least the gray skies are clinging as hard as they
can. What do you wish to do?

01:49:45.810 --> 01:49:48.995
LIAM: Sun's on its way down, you said?

01:49:48.995 --> 01:49:50.394
MATT: The sun has recently set.

01:49:50.394 --> 01:49:51.427
LIAM: It has set, okay.

01:49:51.427 --> 01:49:55.956
TRAVIS: I feel like I should divvy up that gold
that I didn't hand out earlier.

01:49:55.956 --> 01:49:57.512
TALIESIN: That is a very fine idea.

01:49:57.512 --> 01:49:58.513
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll have to remember--

01:49:58.513 --> 01:49:59.761
MARISHA: We want to go back to the Leaky Tap?

01:49:59.761 --> 01:50:01.046
TRAVIS: I'll have to remember to do that some
other day.

01:50:01.046 --> 01:50:02.479
TALIESIN: I think that also sounds like a very
fine idea.

01:50:02.479 --> 01:50:06.799
MARISHA: You know, that's safe. We should also
probably check in on the dodeca-doohickey as well.

01:50:06.799 --> 01:50:08.442
TALIESIN: That's a fair point.

01:50:08.442 --> 01:50:11.173
TRAVIS: Oh, right. Does Jester have that?

01:50:11.173 --> 01:50:13.456
MATT: Jester has it, yeah, inside the backpack.

01:50:13.456 --> 01:50:16.221
MARISHA: Oh, right, she has it. Never mind.

01:50:16.221 --> 01:50:21.210
TRAVIS: I guess we should let Horris know that
he'll get an escort out of town, right?

01:50:21.210 --> 01:50:24.298
MARISHA: Yeah. He was at the Leaky Tap, right? We
left him there?

01:50:24.298 --> 01:50:25.534
MATT: You left him at the Leaky Tap, yeah.

01:50:25.534 --> 01:50:26.732
MARISHA: Okay, yeah. Let's do that.

01:50:26.732 --> 01:50:27.807
TRAVIS: Let's do it.

01:50:27.807 --> 01:50:34.268
MATT: So you guys head back to the Leaky Tap. You
head back to your chambers, and within the one

01:50:34.268 --> 01:50:39.636
room, Horris has been very careful. As soon as you
open the door, Horris immediately grabs the nearby

01:50:39.636 --> 01:50:42.897
chair and like gets ready. "Oh. You've returned."

01:50:42.897 --> 01:50:46.806
MARISHA: Going for the chair. I'm into it.

01:50:46.806 --> 01:50:47.806
TRAVIS: Yeah, right?

01:50:47.806 --> 01:50:53.889
MATT: "Sorry, just, I'm a little jumpy. How are
things going? How's the search been?"

01:50:53.889 --> 01:51:01.825
TRAVIS: It went well. I think we found suitable
passage for you out of this city. Needless to say,

01:51:01.825 --> 01:51:06.186
without involving you too much, we're going to
have someone take you out a secret entrance and

01:51:06.186 --> 01:51:07.812
make sure you're safe on your way out.

01:51:07.812 --> 01:51:09.525
MARISHA: I hope you're okay with being
blindfolded.

01:51:09.525 --> 01:51:13.410
MATT: "I trust you. Yeah."

01:51:13.410 --> 01:51:15.696
MARISHA: Sorry. It was part of the deal.

01:51:15.696 --> 01:51:17.003
TRAVIS: Yeah, I guess it was.

01:51:17.003 --> 01:51:25.062
MATT: "Okay. No, that's fine. (sighs) Thank you. I
can't even begin to express my thanks."

01:51:25.062 --> 01:51:32.337
TRAVIS: I didn't write down how much fucking gold,
didn't I? 620.

01:51:32.337 --> 01:51:36.033
SAM: Is Dolan gone? Already?

01:51:36.033 --> 01:51:39.185
MARISHA: Dolan is staying. Horris is getting out
of Dodge.

01:51:39.185 --> 01:51:40.248
SAM: Got it.

01:51:40.248 --> 01:51:46.671
MARISHA: Horris, have you heard anything while
we've been gone, or have you been staying in here?

01:51:46.671 --> 01:51:54.005
MATT: "I've been staying in here. I've been
looking out the windows. There's been more guard

01:51:54.005 --> 01:52:01.362
"activity in the streets. It looks like they're
making their way inward into the city and

01:52:01.362 --> 01:52:09.513
"beginning to inquire, at least from what I've
seen. That's it. Other than that, I've just been

01:52:09.513 --> 01:52:13.135
"bored and reading this book." (chuckles)

01:52:13.135 --> 01:52:15.391
TALIESIN: Page-turner.

01:52:15.391 --> 01:52:16.267
MATT: "Yeah."

01:52:16.267 --> 01:52:17.329
TRAVIS: Any favorite parts?

01:52:17.329 --> 01:52:21.616
MATT: "Eh, no."

01:52:21.616 --> 01:52:24.864
TRAVIS: Hate those. Pictures good?

01:52:24.864 --> 01:52:27.166
MATT: "There aren't any pictures."

01:52:27.166 --> 01:52:29.274
TRAVIS: What the fuck are you reading it for,
then?

01:52:29.274 --> 01:52:31.720
MATT: (clears throat) "Anyway."

01:52:31.720 --> 01:52:34.247
MARISHA: (whispers) Your Grog is showing.

01:52:34.247 --> 01:52:37.918
TRAVIS: Yeah, sorry. Listen, everybody gets 104
gold.

01:52:37.918 --> 01:52:39.504
SAM: 104 gold?!

01:52:39.504 --> 01:52:40.968
TRAVIS: Yep, and three silver.

01:52:40.968 --> 01:52:43.918
MARISHA: 104 gold.

01:52:43.918 --> 01:52:46.593
TRAVIS: No, not you.

01:52:46.593 --> 01:52:47.928
TALIESIN: Not yet.

01:52:47.928 --> 01:52:52.142
ASHLEY: (laughs) Fuck off. I was there in spirit.

01:52:52.142 --> 01:52:54.737
SAM: How many silver? What did you say?

01:52:54.737 --> 01:52:55.990
TRAVIS: Three silver.

01:52:55.990 --> 01:52:57.245
SAM: Oh.

01:52:57.245 --> 01:53:02.500
LIAM: This is a good time to mention that in
between last game and this--

01:53:02.500 --> 01:53:03.939
MATT: Oh, right.

01:53:03.939 --> 01:53:05.307
LIAM: --cantrips not--

01:53:05.307 --> 01:53:07.524
MATT: You can buy cantrip scrolls, but not--

01:53:07.524 --> 01:53:08.929
LIAM: Right, but Caleb would have known that.

01:53:08.929 --> 01:53:09.907
MATT: Right.

01:53:09.907 --> 01:53:11.397
LIAM: After Liam had asked the DM.

01:53:11.397 --> 01:53:12.830
MATT: Correct. You cannot transcribe cantrips.

01:53:12.830 --> 01:53:17.199
LIAM: So we're switching out that cantrip for Hold
Person, if that was at the store.

01:53:17.199 --> 01:53:19.869
MATT: Right. Yeah, it was. And paid the
difference.

01:53:19.869 --> 01:53:22.267
LIAM: And Caleb is flat broke. Until right now!

01:53:22.267 --> 01:53:28.086
MATT: There you go! Always skirting that edge. I
lived <i>that</i> life for three years.

01:53:28.086 --> 01:53:31.481
TRAVIS: So did we all.

01:53:31.662 --> 01:53:33.226
MARISHA: So much ramen.

01:53:33.226 --> 01:53:34.789
TALIESIN: It was D&amp;D ramen.

01:53:34.789 --> 01:53:37.227
MATT: Paycheck, paycheck, paycheck. Paycheck! It's
gone.

01:53:37.227 --> 01:53:38.533
TRAVIS: Cereal for dinner.

01:53:38.533 --> 01:53:40.942
MATT: "Anyway."

01:53:40.942 --> 01:53:47.756
TRAVIS: Well. I assume they'll come for you,
sometime in the night or in the morning. Hope you

01:53:47.756 --> 01:53:55.059
won't mind if we don't wait. We traded your
expedited journey out of the city in order for us

01:53:55.059 --> 01:53:58.327
to go and take care of some bit of business for
them.

01:53:58.327 --> 01:54:03.809
MATT: "Very well. Just tell me what you need from
me, or what I should do."

01:54:03.809 --> 01:54:06.720
TRAVIS: We didn't really ask, did we?

01:54:06.720 --> 01:54:13.238
MARISHA: I thought he was coming with us when we
go to leave. That's what I thought.

01:54:13.238 --> 01:54:14.426
TRAVIS: Oh.

01:54:14.426 --> 01:54:16.443
MARISHA: Is that-- or am I mistaken?

01:54:16.443 --> 01:54:17.792
TRAVIS: No, I think that's probably right.

01:54:17.792 --> 01:54:21.561
MATT: You didn't specify. But that seems like it
might be a viable plan.

01:54:21.561 --> 01:54:23.473
MARISHA: Okay.

01:54:23.473 --> 01:54:25.653
TRAVIS: Either that or they'll kill him. (fake
laugh)

01:54:25.653 --> 01:54:26.997
MATT: "What?"

01:54:26.997 --> 01:54:32.287
MARISHA: Out of game, out of game! Don't, you're
not-- DM's not here. DM's not here.

01:54:32.287 --> 01:54:34.172
MATT: DM's always here.

01:54:34.172 --> 01:54:41.415
MARISHA: Well, we should probably blindfold him
ourselves on the way there so he just don't even.

01:54:41.415 --> 01:54:42.736
We'll figure it out.

01:54:42.736 --> 01:54:44.572
LIAM: You blindfold him on the way to being
blindfolded?

01:54:44.572 --> 01:54:45.536
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:54:45.536 --> 01:54:46.472
LIAM: Oh?

01:54:46.472 --> 01:54:50.953
MARISHA: Because if we take him down into the
Evening Nip with us then they're going to want to

01:54:50.953 --> 01:54:54.670
do the whole "Let me take your blood!" thing and
"You weren't here," and "Who the fuck are you?"

01:54:54.670 --> 01:54:55.809
and all that shit.

01:54:55.809 --> 01:54:56.852
LIAM: Oh.

01:54:56.852 --> 01:54:57.829
TRAVIS: True.

01:54:57.829 --> 01:55:01.732
TALIESIN: How are we going to get him through the
city with a blindfold on?

01:55:01.732 --> 01:55:06.507
MARISHA: So we don't want to do that. Sorry, also
Marisha talking right now.

01:55:06.507 --> 01:55:09.254
TRAVIS: Maybe just before we go in. Anything we
want to do before we go out on this errand?

01:55:09.254 --> 01:55:15.869
SAM: Oh, I think there was one thing. Tell us
everything about you! Are you fucking kidding me?!

01:55:15.869 --> 01:55:19.428
Leave! Leave, Horris! Leave!

01:55:19.428 --> 01:55:24.935
MATT: "I'll step in one of the other rooms. Is
there a key I could--"

01:55:24.935 --> 01:55:30.067
MARISHA: Here. I toss him mine and Jester's key.
Just don't steal any of the pillowcases or go

01:55:30.067 --> 01:55:33.275
through any of our luggage.

01:55:33.275 --> 01:55:34.797
TRAVIS: Yeah, they're booby-trapped.

01:55:34.797 --> 01:55:39.640
MATT: "Okay." He leaves the room. As soon as he
leaves the room, Jester goes, "Okay, so tell us

01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:42.982
"about you! Each!"

01:55:42.982 --> 01:55:46.394
ASHLEY: I mean, this is not about me right now.

01:55:46.394 --> 01:55:48.571
SAM: It could be!

01:55:48.571 --> 01:55:50.251
ASHLEY: It doesn't need to be.

01:55:50.251 --> 01:55:57.833
SAM: But you have secrets too! And you're a pair!
You know, I distinctly remember a moment when we

01:55:57.833 --> 01:56:02.228
were the shady pair of this group. But now it
looks like you guys are!

01:56:02.228 --> 01:56:06.886
TALIESIN: Everyone's a shady pair in this group.
Somehow, even as individuals, we are all

01:56:06.886 --> 01:56:09.451
somehow shady pairs. It is just inevitable.

01:56:09.508 --> 01:56:11.414
SAM: Now I'm hungry for pears.

01:56:11.414 --> 01:56:15.174
TRAVIS: Sounds like a retirement home. The Shady
Pear.

01:56:15.174 --> 01:56:22.024
(laughter)

01:56:22.024 --> 01:56:29.936
TRAVIS: I mean, Lucien, Noganon, what the fuck?

01:56:29.936 --> 01:56:36.604
MARISHA: Lucien sounds very, "I'm trying to find
myself," by the way. Just throwing that out there.

01:56:36.604 --> 01:56:38.101
SAM: Angsty teen.

01:56:38.101 --> 01:56:39.909
MARISHA: Yeah, it's very angsty teen!

01:56:39.909 --> 01:56:41.968
TRAVIS: Is your real name Peter?

01:56:41.968 --> 01:56:45.583
MARISHA: I dated a few Luciens. Like, way too many
Luciens.

01:56:45.583 --> 01:56:51.101
TALIESIN: Is this Marisha, or is this Beau?

01:56:51.101 --> 01:56:53.850
MARISHA: This is... Beau.

01:56:53.850 --> 01:56:55.315
TALIESIN: Never mind.

01:56:55.315 --> 01:56:57.306
MARISHA: Beau, but it's still not necessarily
untrue.

01:56:57.306 --> 01:57:02.257
TRAVIS: Undetermined percentage is still--

01:57:02.257 --> 01:57:05.258
TALIESIN: We've all been Lucien.

01:57:05.258 --> 01:57:10.274
LIAM: Six of one, half a dozen of another. Order
of the story.

01:57:10.274 --> 01:57:12.104
MARISHA: Lot of guys in bands. Yeah.

01:57:12.104 --> 01:57:20.240
TALIESIN: So. Well, I was born on the continent
of-- I really--

01:57:20.240 --> 01:57:22.275
TRAVIS: No, don't stop. Just keep going.

01:57:22.275 --> 01:57:30.085
SAM: Would you like a drink? Here. It's filled
with many alcohols from different taverns.

01:57:30.085 --> 01:57:33.828
TALIESIN: I genuinely thought I would have some
bullshit together by now, and I'm really sort of stuck.

01:57:33.828 --> 01:57:37.517
ASHLEY: Listen, I've never pushed you to talk
about anything. If you don't feel comfortable, you

01:57:37.517 --> 01:57:39.778
don't owe any of us anything.

01:57:39.778 --> 01:57:43.275
TALIESIN: It's dangerous, though. It's officially
dangerous.

01:57:43.275 --> 01:57:48.191
TRAVIS: What, to tell us what you're about to tell
us? For us, or for you?

01:57:48.191 --> 01:57:50.780
TALIESIN: At this point, what's the difference?

01:57:50.780 --> 01:57:53.391
TRAVIS: Well, one's us and one's you.

01:57:53.391 --> 01:57:58.740
MARISHA: We definitely left our vials in a shady
cellar with a bunch of underground criminals.

01:57:58.740 --> 01:58:05.260
SAM: I stole three empty vials from that place.
I'm very excited about them. They're empty, but

01:58:05.260 --> 01:58:07.020
they're still really shiny.

01:58:07.020 --> 01:58:10.785
LIAM: (intones melody)

01:58:10.785 --> 01:58:16.426
TRAVIS: They're all the same note because they're
all fucking empty. (intones melody) Oh no, that

01:58:16.426 --> 01:58:17.740
wouldn't work.

01:58:17.740 --> 01:58:24.458
SAM: But seriously.

01:58:24.458 --> 01:58:31.673
TALIESIN: But seriously. I've been part of a shady
group. I've been dealing with shady friends for as

01:58:31.724 --> 01:58:34.940
long as I can remember. If there's one thing I've
learned about dealing with people that you can't

01:58:34.940 --> 01:58:42.696
trust, is that you have to trust them where you
can and not trust them where you can't. I'm not

01:58:42.696 --> 01:58:55.001
saying that I know what I'm doing or anything, but
I don't want anybody-- I want this to work. I need

01:58:55.001 --> 01:58:59.875
this to work. I've not done this in a while. All
right.

01:59:00.018 --> 01:59:06.708
TRAVIS: I noticed that she kind of had the same
influence over the blood that you have, but

01:59:06.712 --> 01:59:07.788
different.

01:59:07.788 --> 01:59:13.222
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's interesting, isn't it? This
might even be easier if you just ask questions. I

01:59:13.222 --> 01:59:15.048
really don't know how to tell this story.

01:59:15.048 --> 01:59:17.666
LIAM: Why do you have so many names?

01:59:17.666 --> 01:59:30.686
TALIESIN: I woke up without any names, or any
past, buried in the ground two years ago.

01:59:30.686 --> 01:59:32.494
TRAVIS: Buried in the ground?

01:59:32.494 --> 01:59:34.206
LIAM: You woke up buried in the ground?

01:59:34.206 --> 01:59:35.256
SAM: Were you dead?

01:59:35.256 --> 01:59:36.563
TALIESIN: Obviously not.

01:59:36.563 --> 01:59:39.288
TRAVIS: In a box? In the dirt?

01:59:39.288 --> 01:59:40.487
TALIESIN: In the dirt.

01:59:40.487 --> 01:59:42.506
LIAM: And you are saying that you have no memory?

01:59:42.506 --> 01:59:47.993
TALIESIN: My first memory, my oldest memory is
dirt in my face, underground.

01:59:47.993 --> 01:59:52.233
SAM: Jester would like to cast Zone of Truth.

01:59:52.233 --> 02:00:00.704
LIAM: Keeping it real on the field line!

02:00:00.704 --> 02:00:06.223
SAM: She says: (as Jester) I would like to play
truth or dare, but without the dare.

02:00:06.223 --> 02:00:07.726
TALIESIN: How honest do I have to be?

02:00:07.726 --> 02:00:08.922
MATT: We'll find out in a second.

02:00:08.922 --> 02:00:09.637
TALIESIN: Okay.

02:00:09.637 --> 02:00:14.205
LIAM: Well, you can say whatever you want, but
whatever you say has to be true. That's how it

02:00:14.306 --> 02:00:16.504
works. You can also just say, "I don't feel like
talking."

02:00:16.504 --> 02:00:21.222
MATT: All right, all of you who are in the 15-foot
radius it's being cast in, which would probably

02:00:21.222 --> 02:00:27.598
be... everybody. You're all staying close on this.
Everybody please make charisma saving throw.

02:00:27.598 --> 02:00:28.469
LIAM: Wow.

02:00:28.469 --> 02:00:29.807
MARISHA: Saving throw?

02:00:29.807 --> 02:00:30.820
TRAVIS: Charisma saving throw?

02:00:30.820 --> 02:00:32.026
MATT: Charisma saving throw.

02:00:32.094 --> 02:00:33.239
SAM: I got a one.

02:00:33.239 --> 02:00:34.471
ASHLEY: Hey, money!

02:00:34.471 --> 02:00:36.632
SAM: Natural one! Ten dollars! To 826LA!

02:00:36.632 --> 02:00:37.628
(cheering)

02:00:37.628 --> 02:00:38.503
MARISHA: It's 100 dollars.

02:00:38.503 --> 02:00:40.326
SAM: What!? That's even better!

02:00:40.326 --> 02:00:41.956
MARISHA: 100 dollars for every natural one.

02:00:41.956 --> 02:00:43.252
TALIESIN: I rolled a four.

02:00:43.252 --> 02:00:44.539
SAM: Okay, you're in.

02:00:44.539 --> 02:00:45.540
ASHLEY: 13.

02:00:45.540 --> 02:00:46.687
LIAM: 13.

02:00:46.687 --> 02:00:47.537
MARISHA: 16.

02:00:47.537 --> 02:00:48.529
TRAVIS: 22.

02:00:48.529 --> 02:00:53.106
MATT: You are the only two that succeeded.
Everyone else, you have to speak the truth.

02:00:53.106 --> 02:00:57.391
LIAM: But, DM, we know that, we feel it, according
to the spell.

02:00:57.391 --> 02:01:04.002
MATT: Yes. You all sense the energy come over you
and for a second you're a little confused by it.

02:01:04.002 --> 02:01:09.663
TALIESIN: All right, that's not entirely true.
It's a vague memory. I don't really remember it.

02:01:09.663 --> 02:01:14.177
It's kind of all jumbled. It's what I've been
told, about some of it.

02:01:14.177 --> 02:01:18.026
MARISHA: So is that ritual she was rambling
about?

02:01:18.026 --> 02:01:19.844
TALIESIN: I don't know.

02:01:19.844 --> 02:01:22.490
TRAVIS: So before you woke up in the dirt,
nothing?

02:01:22.490 --> 02:01:26.952
TALIESIN: There is no before. Whatever happened
before is not me. It's not part of anything--

02:01:28.021 --> 02:01:29.177
(sighs)

02:01:29.177 --> 02:01:33.559
SAM: Like your life reset somehow? Or you just
don't remember?

02:01:36.529 --> 02:01:44.135
TALIESIN: Some asshole got buried in the dirt.
Fuck him. I am enjoying what I'm doing; I want

02:01:44.232 --> 02:01:48.414
nothing to do with that. Anything that came
before, I was happy to just leave it be.

02:01:48.414 --> 02:01:51.095
LIAM: Yeah, but do you have any theories for what
happened before?

02:01:51.095 --> 02:01:52.108
TALIESIN: No.

02:01:52.108 --> 02:01:56.833
MARISHA: Did you look the same, or did you come
back--?

02:01:57.493 --> 02:01:59.409
TALIESIN: How would I know?

02:02:00.672 --> 02:02:04.495
SAM: Everything before two years ago is nothing to
you. Black.

02:02:04.495 --> 02:02:06.429
TALIESIN: That's somebody else.

02:02:06.429 --> 02:02:09.170
TRAVIS: Two years ago, did you have all those
tattoos?

02:02:09.170 --> 02:02:10.673
TALIESIN: No, not exactly.

02:02:10.673 --> 02:02:12.117
SAM: Any of them?

02:02:12.117 --> 02:02:13.537
TALIESIN: Some of them, yes.

02:02:13.537 --> 02:02:17.437
LIAM: How much time passed between waking up in a
dirt box and the circus?

02:02:17.437 --> 02:02:26.740
TALIESIN: Days. I was a bit out of it. It's hard
to remember. I wasn't speaking, really. Do you

02:02:26.740 --> 02:02:28.300
have memories from your childhood?

02:02:28.300 --> 02:02:29.315
LIAM: Yeah, many.

02:02:29.315 --> 02:02:30.144
TRAVIS: Sure.

02:02:30.144 --> 02:02:41.437
TALIESIN: It felt like that. It's all bright and
more meaningful than it should be. There was just

02:02:41.437 --> 02:02:47.718
nothing. I was practically catatonic; I was barely
speaking.

02:02:47.718 --> 02:02:50.672
MARISHA: Did you wake up to people, or alone?

02:02:50.672 --> 02:02:52.228
TALIESIN: Alone.

02:02:52.228 --> 02:02:54.363
LIAM: Are you a good guy?

02:02:59.623 --> 02:03:01.232
TALIESIN: I'd like to think so.

02:03:04.151 --> 02:03:07.922
TRAVIS: Why did she seem like she looked up to you
so much?

02:03:07.922 --> 02:03:17.093
TALIESIN: I don't know. I don't know who that was.
I've never heard the name Lucien before, or that

02:03:17.093 --> 02:03:21.003
other name. I've never heard of any of it.

02:03:21.003 --> 02:03:27.123
ASHLEY: I didn't realize you didn't. You did a
good job at pretending.

02:03:27.123 --> 02:03:30.760
TALIESIN: Yeah, well. I like pretending.
Pretending's great.

02:03:32.535 --> 02:03:34.851
Who cares where anybody came from?

02:03:34.851 --> 02:03:39.646
MARISHA: How do you know she actually thinks it's
you and not, you know, maybe she just mistook you

02:03:39.646 --> 02:03:42.727
for someone actually named Lucien?

02:03:42.727 --> 02:03:47.440
TALIESIN: That's possible except, of course, she
had weird blood powers.

02:03:47.440 --> 02:03:49.822
MARISHA: So this happens to you.

02:03:49.822 --> 02:03:59.455
TALIESIN: Few months after I came to, I started
noticing I could do things, knew things that I

02:03:59.455 --> 02:04:01.549
didn't necessarily know I knew.

02:04:01.549 --> 02:04:03.648
LIAM: Are you talking about your abilities?

02:04:03.648 --> 02:04:10.137
TALIESIN: Yeah. I can-- can I see that dagger?

02:04:11.015 --> 02:04:12.138
SAM: I have three of them.

02:04:12.138 --> 02:04:13.315
TALIESIN: Pick one.

02:04:13.885 --> 02:04:14.740
SAM: (dink)

02:04:15.748 --> 02:04:17.207
TALIESIN: Ice.

02:04:17.207 --> 02:04:21.973
MATT: You watch as this large cluster of moisture
all of a sudden solidifies around the outside of

02:04:21.973 --> 02:04:27.053
the blade, and the blade is now encrusted in
jagged ice shards that just stick out, the steam

02:04:27.053 --> 02:04:30.865
coming off of it. Mist.

02:04:30.865 --> 02:04:36.213
SAM: That's amazing. I would ask about how you
discovered that, because that would not be

02:04:36.213 --> 02:04:42.166
something that I would ever just do, just to just
see. But we'll leave that for another day.

02:04:42.166 --> 02:04:46.990
TALIESIN: Oh no, I can, we're here. This is
happening. That's fine.

02:04:48.900 --> 02:04:56.361
SAM: Question. Go back two beats. You said, "Who
cares about what happened before?"

02:04:57.248 --> 02:04:58.114
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:04:58.114 --> 02:05:05.683
SAM: Do you really not want to know your past?
Answer truthfully.

02:05:05.683 --> 02:05:17.922
TALIESIN: I really don't. Whoever that was came to
that end, and I want nothing to do with that.

02:05:17.922 --> 02:05:23.465
Whatever it was, it doesn't feel good when I-- the
moment when something creeps through, I don't like

02:05:23.465 --> 02:05:30.476
it. I don't want anything to do with it. I was
happy! I liked the circus! The circus was great!

02:05:31.316 --> 02:05:38.683
LIAM: (As Jester) "Oh! I have a question! Is there
anyone in the group you find super attractive?"

02:05:38.683 --> 02:05:40.171
(As Liam) A text from Laura.

02:05:40.566 --> 02:05:41.740
TALIESIN: Yes.

02:05:41.740 --> 02:05:43.354
MATT: I think she was asking Yasha.

02:05:45.514 --> 02:05:47.254
LIAM: Oh, ask Yasha, oh.

02:05:47.428 --> 02:05:49.338
ASHLEY: Too late.

02:05:50.558 --> 02:05:52.650
LIAM: (As Jester) "What about you?"

02:05:53.711 --> 02:05:57.727
MATT: As the nature of the spell, you know you are
under the effect of it, and you can be dodgy if

02:05:57.727 --> 02:06:00.442
you need to, but it's up to you.

02:06:00.442 --> 02:06:03.638
LIAM: (As Jester) "You can tell me!"

02:06:04.461 --> 02:06:05.746
TALIESIN: That's a good Laura.

02:06:05.746 --> 02:06:13.779
ASHLEY: I feel like-- it's a very good Laura. Yes, of
course there are people here that I think are very

02:06:13.779 --> 02:06:19.666
attractive and charming, but that doesn't mean I
will act on that.

02:06:20.450 --> 02:06:24.451
TALIESIN: You can be monosyllabic if you like with
these people.

02:06:24.451 --> 02:06:25.130
TRAVIS: Molly--

02:06:25.130 --> 02:06:26.234
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

02:06:26.234 --> 02:06:28.002
TRAVIS: In the years that have gone by--

02:06:28.002 --> 02:06:30.242
SAM: Yasha has a crush on me.

02:06:31.442 --> 02:06:36.126
TRAVIS: Has anyone called you any other names
besides Molly, Lucien or--

02:06:36.848 --> 02:06:37.908
SAM: Nonagon?

02:06:37.908 --> 02:06:39.644
TRAVIS: Yeah. Mahna Mahna.

02:06:39.644 --> 02:06:44.895
TALIESIN: Yeah, whatever that was. Not without me
feeding it to them first. I mean, I've conned

02:06:44.976 --> 02:06:48.335
people. We've all conned people. I've used other
names before.

02:06:48.335 --> 02:06:51.781
TRAVIS: No, but did they know you? Did they come
up and give you a name?

02:06:51.781 --> 02:06:54.526
ASHLEY: This was the first time that's
happened.

02:06:57.493 --> 02:07:02.004
TALIESIN: A lot of this was in the hopes that
maybe it would never happen, keep moving, keep quiet.

02:07:03.771 --> 02:07:07.528
TRAVIS: You don't know anything about the ritual
she was talking about?

02:07:07.528 --> 02:07:19.358
TALIESIN: But I'll say this, and I'm going to put
the knife down. Is there anything sharp around?

02:07:19.358 --> 02:07:21.459
Anything at all?

02:07:21.459 --> 02:07:22.879
TRAVIS: In this group?

02:07:22.879 --> 02:07:24.373
MATT: Yeah, plenty of things that are sharp.

02:07:24.373 --> 02:07:28.207
TALIESIN: Something that's even ridiculous, like
something not normal.

02:07:28.207 --> 02:07:33.826
MATT: Yeah, I mean, there are jagged parts of the
wooden frame of the bed.

02:07:33.826 --> 02:07:38.352
TALIESIN: Perfect! I'm just going to cut myself
again on the wooden frame and grab it, and use radiance.

02:07:38.410 --> 02:07:45.618
MATT: Okay. You watch as this bright, vibrant
light billows out of it, glowing in the vicinity,

02:07:45.618 --> 02:07:48.315
similar that you've seen it encase the scimitar.

02:07:48.315 --> 02:07:50.602
TALIESIN: I'll admit, this is new.

02:07:50.602 --> 02:07:52.395
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's a hell of a thing.

02:07:52.395 --> 02:07:54.493
TALIESIN: You got to see the first time this
happened.

02:07:54.493 --> 02:07:55.555
TRAVIS: Right.

02:07:55.555 --> 02:08:00.500
LIAM: Yasha, how much of this was under wraps? You
knew any of this, in your time in the circus with--

02:08:00.569 --> 02:08:07.922
ASHLEY: I knew that he woke up and that he did not
know who he was, but this was the first time that

02:08:07.922 --> 02:08:14.617
this has happened. Where someone has come to us
and recognized him from his past.

02:08:15.133 --> 02:08:18.257
LIAM: (As Jester) "Molly, what about have you ever
pooped your pants?"

02:08:18.934 --> 02:08:21.900
TRAVIS: That's actually in the text thread chain.

02:08:22.222 --> 02:08:28.934
TALIESIN: Not that I'm-- Well, no. That's fair,
sure. Well, it was worth it every time.

02:08:28.934 --> 02:08:39.503
SAM: I'm sorry to belabor this, but what if you
had a good life before this? What if you were

02:08:39.503 --> 02:08:42.880
famous or rich or had friends or family?

02:08:42.880 --> 02:08:45.890
ASHLEY: I think were quite an amazing person--

02:08:45.890 --> 02:08:51.560
TALIESIN: Okay, here's the thing that you're not
catching. That wasn't me. This is mine. I don't

02:08:51.560 --> 02:08:58.548
want anything from that other person anymore. That
person is someone else. I don't want anything to

02:08:58.548 --> 02:09:08.151
do with it. I did not feel good coming out of
that. It was-- I'm in for a penny, might as well.

02:09:11.420 --> 02:09:17.126
I'm told, although I don't entirely remember this
part, that I only said the word empty over and

02:09:17.208 --> 02:09:18.939
over again for the first week.

02:09:18.939 --> 02:09:20.840
TRAVIS, MARISHA, and SAM: Empty?

02:09:20.840 --> 02:09:23.463
TALIESIN: I don't know what that means.

02:09:23.463 --> 02:09:24.947
LIAM: M.T. or empty?

02:09:24.947 --> 02:09:28.864
TALIESIN: Empty. I don't know. Barely remember.

02:09:28.864 --> 02:09:34.867
LIAM: Jester? I feel your touch on this
conversation, is this all accurate?

02:09:34.867 --> 02:09:38.250
MATT: "As far as I can tell, yes. He did indeed
poop his pants."

02:09:39.180 --> 02:09:40.475
LIAM: And the rest?

02:09:41.092 --> 02:09:42.576
MATT: "Oh that too, yes!"

02:09:42.576 --> 02:09:43.502
SAM: Empty.

02:09:44.532 --> 02:09:55.998
TALIESIN: That sounds terrible. I don't want to
remember anything. I don't want to anybody else's

02:09:56.070 --> 02:10:02.809
baggage in my head and I don't want anybody else's
problems, thoughts, ideas. I like this person,

02:10:02.809 --> 02:10:06.269
right now is a good person. Is a fine person. Is a
happy person.

02:10:06.269 --> 02:10:08.541
MARISHA: She kept referencing a book.

02:10:08.541 --> 02:10:10.342
TRAVIS: No idea.

02:10:10.342 --> 02:10:12.268
TALIESIN: Sounds shifty.

02:10:12.268 --> 02:10:13.640
MARISHA: What if we could find the book?

02:10:13.640 --> 02:10:15.652
TALIESIN: Nope. I don't want it.

02:10:15.652 --> 02:10:24.183
LIAM: Well, I will say, I am a little concerned
about, you know, loose ends coming to bite you,

02:10:24.183 --> 02:10:26.876
and us in the butt. However--

02:10:26.876 --> 02:10:28.965
TALIESIN: We all have a few, I assume.

02:10:28.965 --> 02:10:35.797
LIAM: I believe in second starts and that's enough
for me.

02:10:36.335 --> 02:10:40.604
TALIESIN: Can you imagine what it would feel like
to not feel anything about anything that had

02:10:40.604 --> 02:10:42.201
happened to you so far?

02:10:42.201 --> 02:10:43.412
TRAVIS, LIAM, and SAM: No.

02:10:43.412 --> 02:10:45.273
MARISHA: Yes.

02:10:45.485 --> 02:10:47.006
TALIESIN: Why am I not surprised?

02:10:47.137 --> 02:10:53.068
SAM: What do you mean yes? You can imagine what
it's like what it's like to not feel anything

02:10:53.068 --> 02:10:57.840
before this moment? Have you died before?

02:10:57.840 --> 02:11:01.895
MARISHA: No. Doesn't mean you have to find meaning
in meaningless things.

02:11:01.895 --> 02:11:09.679
TALIESIN: It's very freeing. It's the best thing--
it's the thing that happened to me. It's not the

02:11:09.679 --> 02:11:17.904
best thing that happened to me, it's the thing
that happened to me. I found peace in building a

02:11:17.904 --> 02:11:22.748
new person. The Moonweaver--

02:11:27.310 --> 02:11:32.555
MARISHA: You know just because you know about your
past doesn't mean you have to be beholden to it.

02:11:32.555 --> 02:11:34.441
SAM: That's true.

02:11:34.441 --> 02:11:36.411
MARISHA: If you--

02:11:37.513 --> 02:11:40.551
TALIESIN: What if it feels that I owe it
something?

02:11:40.551 --> 02:11:46.529
MARISHA: You don't owe your past shit. If I don't
feel anything about my past, but I still remember

02:11:46.529 --> 02:11:51.234
it and I still don't give a fuck about where I
came from then, why should you care about shit

02:11:51.234 --> 02:11:54.634
that you don't even remember?

02:11:56.742 --> 02:11:58.493
TRAVIS: That's a layered question.

02:12:00.124 --> 02:12:09.879
TALIESIN: I spent two years before I met you all
cajoling people, occasionally ripping them off,

02:12:09.879 --> 02:12:19.462
occasionally doing a good turn here or there.
Never trust the truth. The truth is vicious. The

02:12:19.462 --> 02:12:29.765
truth thinks you owe it something. None of that. I
like my bullshit. It's good. It's happy. It makes

02:12:29.765 --> 02:12:31.341
other people happy.

02:12:31.341 --> 02:12:33.008
SAM: But it's not who you are.

02:12:33.008 --> 02:12:35.417
TALIESIN: It is exactly who I am.

02:12:35.694 --> 02:12:39.591
TRAVIS: Can I ask you, when you're praying over
your swords at night, are you actually doing anything?

02:12:40.931 --> 02:12:43.590
TALIESIN: Well, do you know who the Moonweaver
is?

02:12:43.590 --> 02:12:44.522
TRAVIS: No.

02:12:44.522 --> 02:12:51.660
TALIESIN: Excellent. The swords are cheap carnival
glass. There's nothing special about them.

02:12:51.660 --> 02:12:54.827
LIAM: May I make a check to see if I have ever
heard of the Moonweaver?

02:12:54.827 --> 02:12:56.694
MATT: Make a religion check.

02:13:00.459 --> 02:13:02.134
SAM: Is the Moonweaver not real?

02:13:02.311 --> 02:13:04.367
LIAM: 23.

02:13:04.367 --> 02:13:06.530
MATT: Oh yeah, you've definitely heard of the
Moonweaver.

02:13:06.530 --> 02:13:09.932
TALIESIN: Literally a decorated pair of swords to
make them look special.

02:13:09.932 --> 02:13:20.574
MATT: The Moonweaver is classically more of an
elven deity. They are a god over night, of

02:13:20.574 --> 02:13:27.392
shadows, music, there's a lot of variations to
what they go over, but they are definitely not one

02:13:27.392 --> 02:13:32.411
of the approved religions in the empire, and is
not considered one of the betrayer gods

02:13:32.411 --> 02:13:41.777
classically. Is an inspiration for a lot of art in
classic elven history, even some modern. The

02:13:41.777 --> 02:13:49.012
caretaker of evening trysts. Has a lot of unique
history to the Moonweaver.

02:13:49.533 --> 02:13:52.696
TRAVIS: So it's you that's special, not your
swords.

02:13:52.696 --> 02:13:54.057
TALIESIN: That's true.

02:13:54.057 --> 02:14:00.122
MARISHA: Molly, you seem like you have a pretty
solidified identity for someone who has only had

02:14:00.122 --> 02:14:02.921
consciousness for two years.

02:14:02.921 --> 02:14:06.772
TALIESIN: Things came back quick, and the circus
helped. They were good people. They did a lot of

02:14:06.772 --> 02:14:12.409
me and joy can fill an awful lot of a person's
life.

02:14:12.409 --> 02:14:17.762
MARISHA: Things came back quick; do you feel like
there's still remnants of whoever you once were that

02:14:17.762 --> 02:14:20.078
have informed who you are now?

02:14:20.740 --> 02:14:25.630
TALIESIN: Maybe. I feel tinges of things on
occasion, nothing I like.

02:14:27.620 --> 02:14:28.847
MARISHA: Interesting.

02:14:30.058 --> 02:14:33.840
SAM: If you always lie and bullshit, how are we
ever going to believe you?

02:14:33.840 --> 02:14:36.926
TALIESIN: Because I always lie and bullshit.

02:14:36.926 --> 02:14:41.950
MARISHA: I can kind of agree with that. Cheers to
bullshit.

02:14:42.278 --> 02:14:47.884
TALIESIN: I may be a liar but I'm never a
betrayer. I'm honest in my work, and I believe in

02:14:47.884 --> 02:14:58.807
doing a good turn. I've never cheated you out of
money. I've never robbed from you. I stayed with

02:14:58.807 --> 02:15:05.946
that circus for two years, I know how people treat
each other. It's important. And all that stuff you

02:15:05.946 --> 02:15:09.826
told me before? I've got to admit, I didn't even
listen to any bit of it. I was just trying to

02:15:09.826 --> 02:15:12.842
teach you a lesson. I don't care where you've
been. I don't care what terrible things any of you

02:15:12.842 --> 02:15:15.603
have done. You're here now. This is how it works.

02:15:15.603 --> 02:15:17.068
LIAM: (as Jester) "Molly?"

02:15:18.218 --> 02:15:19.707
TALIESIN: Yes, darling.

02:15:19.707 --> 02:15:21.327
LIAM: (as Jester) "I have a question."

02:15:21.327 --> 02:15:22.783
TALIESIN: Of course.

02:15:22.783 --> 02:15:25.122
LIAM: (as Jester) "Can you really read fortunes?"

02:15:28.688 --> 02:15:40.447
TALIESIN: I use fortunes to tell people what I see
in them. But sometimes, sometimes, I feel like

02:15:40.447 --> 02:15:46.186
maybe there's something that tickles the back of
my head, I will admit.

02:15:46.186 --> 02:15:48.187
LIAM: (as Jester) "You have a feeling?"

02:15:48.187 --> 02:15:49.983
TALIESIN: Some days.

02:15:49.983 --> 02:15:51.691
MARISHA: Don't believe him, Jester.

02:15:52.563 --> 02:15:54.437
TALIESIN: Am I lying?

02:15:54.437 --> 02:15:56.106
SAM: He has to be telling the truth.

02:15:56.106 --> 02:15:56.842
MATT: No.

02:15:56.842 --> 02:15:57.883
TALIESIN: Thank you.

02:15:57.883 --> 02:15:58.974
TRAVIS: He has to.

02:15:58.974 --> 02:16:02.387
ASHLEY: I do feel like you actually, weirdly, have
a gift for that.

02:16:02.387 --> 02:16:06.612
TALIESIN: I always try to be helpful when I turn
cards for people.

02:16:06.612 --> 02:16:11.285
MARISHA: You ever think you could actually be
doing damage, though? Setting people on false paths?

02:16:12.651 --> 02:16:15.988
TALIESIN: People are looking for a path, they're
looking for a path. And I'll tell you-- and this

02:16:15.988 --> 02:16:22.174
is true-- I did my best every town I went to and
every town I left, no matter how they treated me--

02:16:22.174 --> 02:16:25.748
and a lot of them treated me with deep
disrespect.

02:16:25.748 --> 02:16:28.264
MARISHA: Some people are vulnerable and looking
for answers.

02:16:28.264 --> 02:16:31.398
TALIESIN: I left every town better than I found
it.

02:16:34.318 --> 02:16:44.113
SAM: Which tattoos are the old ones? I mean, I
don't want to see your naked body or anything. But

02:16:44.113 --> 02:16:46.100
do you have some?

02:16:47.654 --> 02:16:57.927
TALIESIN: Is it-- yeah, no. So I show off the
peacock a little bit. One of the peacock feathers

02:16:57.927 --> 02:16:59.262
on the neck--

02:16:59.262 --> 02:17:01.433
LIAM: What about your tattoos, though?

02:17:02.361 --> 02:17:08.027
TALIESIN: Thank you, Liam. One of the eyes on one
of the peacock feathers is a bright crimson red,

02:17:08.027 --> 02:17:12.705
which any of you if you'd ever made a fucking
insight check would know. God, I was waiting for

02:17:12.705 --> 02:17:17.014
you to fuck with me. It's also the same place that
he bleeds every time that he uses any of his

02:17:17.014 --> 02:17:22.270
powers. There's also a red eye on the snake on the
palm, and there's a red eye on the snake on the

02:17:22.270 --> 02:17:24.555
opposite side of the hand.

02:17:24.555 --> 02:17:27.345
SAM: What does that mean? What does it mean?
Caleb, what does it mean?

02:17:27.345 --> 02:17:29.519
LIAM: That's a lot of ink, man.

02:17:29.519 --> 02:17:32.069
SAM: Red eyes or something?

02:17:32.069 --> 02:17:33.989
TALIESIN: There are various--

02:17:33.989 --> 02:17:37.208
LIAM: Hey, does any of that symbology mean
anything to me?

02:17:37.208 --> 02:17:39.509
MATT: Not at the moment. How much do you show?

02:17:39.509 --> 02:17:43.733
TALIESIN: I'm just showing the snake, the two
snake eyes. I'm showing the peacock eye. And then

02:17:43.733 --> 02:17:46.706
I'm going to show the eye in the floral
arrangement.

02:17:46.706 --> 02:17:53.617
MARISHA: Come on, Patterson, come on. Help us out
here right now. This is your day job.

02:17:53.617 --> 02:17:55.897
ASHLEY: Well, I'll have to look at my tattoo
database.

02:17:55.897 --> 02:17:57.118
(laughter)

02:17:57.118 --> 02:17:58.995
SAM: Get out the black light.

02:17:59.024 --> 02:18:03.350
TALIESIN: I tried to cover them, but they wouldn't
take ink. So I just did my best.

02:18:03.350 --> 02:18:04.874
SAM: They're not tattoos?

02:18:04.874 --> 02:18:06.790
TALIESIN: No. I don't know what they are.

02:18:08.950 --> 02:18:10.650
SAM: They're just markings?

02:18:12.127 --> 02:18:13.600
TALIESIN: I don't know.

02:18:13.675 --> 02:18:16.922
TRAVIS: But you don't remember getting them? They
just appeared?

02:18:16.922 --> 02:18:18.880
SAM: They were just there.

02:18:18.880 --> 02:18:23.474
LIAM: (as Jester) "(clears throat) Caleb, I have a
question."

02:18:23.576 --> 02:18:27.351
TRAVIS: You don't have to do every one of these
that's she's going to fucking write.

02:18:27.351 --> 02:18:34.283
LIAM: (as Jester) "Do you shave your butt?"
(as Caleb) I can truthfully say--

02:18:34.283 --> 02:18:35.825
TALIESIN: I don't.

02:18:35.825 --> 02:18:37.067
LIAM: No, that was for me.

02:18:37.067 --> 02:18:39.274
TALIESIN: But now that you bring it up, because
I'd never occurred to it, I might start.

02:18:39.274 --> 02:18:40.465
TRAVIS: That was to Caleb.

02:18:40.465 --> 02:18:41.985
TALIESIN: Oh, that was for Caleb. Never mind,
sorry.

02:18:41.985 --> 02:18:44.417
SAM: No, that's very interesting. Good to know.

02:18:44.417 --> 02:18:48.638
LIAM: Now you know that neither Molly nor I shave
our butt.

02:18:48.638 --> 02:18:49.872
TALIESIN: Who butt shaves?

02:18:49.872 --> 02:18:52.196
LIAM: And also there's not a lot of hair there
anyway, so.

02:18:52.196 --> 02:18:55.899
MATT: And also, there's only a couple minutes more
left on the spell.

02:18:55.899 --> 02:18:58.469
TALIESIN: Anything else before we're done here?

02:18:58.469 --> 02:19:03.834
MARISHA: Did you ever know anyone who did used to
try and set people on wrong paths with their

02:19:03.834 --> 02:19:05.754
fortune telling?

02:19:07.864 --> 02:19:10.769
TALIESIN: No. We tried--

02:19:13.114 --> 02:19:17.821
That's dangerous work and it'll
usually backfire. No interest in that. It's mostly

02:19:17.821 --> 02:19:24.875
just trying to help people get their shit
together. Did someone send you on the wrong path?

02:19:24.875 --> 02:19:26.095
MARISHA: No.

02:19:26.095 --> 02:19:28.831
TALIESIN: That's fair. I don't care, to be fair.

02:19:28.831 --> 02:19:31.065
MARISHA: Still in the Zone of Truth now.

02:19:31.065 --> 02:19:33.230
TRAVIS: Is there anything about you that you don't
want us to know?

02:19:33.230 --> 02:19:42.969
TALIESIN: Yes. Everything. I like the safety of
it, and if I had had my way, this would've been a

02:19:42.969 --> 02:19:50.536
conversation for a later date. But I need to
protect you and myself from whatever that is, so

02:19:50.536 --> 02:19:54.332
you need to know that that is a wild card.

02:19:54.332 --> 02:19:56.464
TRAVIS: I appreciate that.

02:19:58.454 --> 02:20:00.052
MARISHA: Well this was fun.

02:20:00.664 --> 02:20:06.540
SAM: I feel like we should do this every night.
But I will say this: Lucien?

02:20:07.522 --> 02:20:08.598
TALIESIN: It's a terrible name.

02:20:08.598 --> 02:20:09.770
SAM: It's <i>terrible</i>.

02:20:09.770 --> 02:20:11.426
TALIESIN: I don't ever want to know who that
person is.

02:20:11.426 --> 02:20:16.113
SAM: It's like a kid with a soft mustache that's
not like a real-- you know, like a--

02:20:16.113 --> 02:20:24.928
TALIESIN: Let me make this abundantly clear. My
name is Molly. That person is dead and not me.

02:20:24.928 --> 02:20:30.794
It's just a person who had this body. They
abandoned it, it's mine now.

02:20:31.423 --> 02:20:42.630
SAM: I think that you need to know where you've
been to know where you're going and I respect your feelings--

02:20:42.630 --> 02:20:46.178
TALIESIN: And I feel that you're fretfully
ignorant and filled with platitudes. But I still

02:20:46.178 --> 02:20:47.773
like you regardless.

02:20:47.870 --> 02:20:56.055
SAM: I feel like when you're ready to know your
past, I would support that and I would help you

02:20:56.055 --> 02:20:57.539
find it.

02:20:59.447 --> 02:21:06.411
TALIESIN: Maybe he killed goblins. Maybe he was a
goblin hunter. Maybe he <i>ate</i> them. Raw.

02:21:07.945 --> 02:21:13.962
LIAM: Perhaps we have learned all we need to learn
from this conversation. Maybe it is time to turn in.

02:21:14.010 --> 02:21:20.728
We have some things to do tomorrow. I am
satisfied, Mollymauk Tealeaf. For now.

02:21:22.329 --> 02:21:27.126
TALIESIN: This was not how I expected this to go.
Thank you.

02:21:29.687 --> 02:21:32.153
MARISHA: For what it's worth, I like you a little
better now.

02:21:32.153 --> 02:21:34.022
SAM: Me too.

02:21:34.022 --> 02:21:36.978
MARISHA: You don't have to reciprocate it.

02:21:37.325 --> 02:21:40.244
TALIESIN: I'm waiting for the spell to dissipate
before I say anything.

02:21:40.616 --> 02:21:42.575
MATT: About now the spell has dissipated.

02:21:42.575 --> 02:21:45.700
TALIESIN: I both like you more and less at the
same time.

02:21:45.700 --> 02:21:47.789
MARISHA: I get that a lot.

02:21:47.789 --> 02:21:49.229
SAM: Is the spell gone?

02:21:49.229 --> 02:21:50.181
MATT: The spell's gone.

02:21:50.181 --> 02:21:53.717
SAM: Goddamn it! Yasha, tell us everything! Fuck!

02:21:54.104 --> 02:21:56.006
MATT: You can still press her.

02:21:56.006 --> 02:21:58.464
TALIESIN: Thank you, dear. (sighs)

02:22:01.513 --> 02:22:05.333
TRAVIS: Should we turn in before we head out
tomorrow?

02:22:08.183 --> 02:22:14.094
MARISHA: Oh yeah, Fjord and I found out that we're
probably going to be facing some undead wispy

02:22:14.239 --> 02:22:16.445
things that might electrocute us.

02:22:16.445 --> 02:22:18.802
SAM: I think we all-- did we all find out? No?

02:22:18.802 --> 02:22:20.795
TRAVIS: Yeah, we came out and told you that.

02:22:20.795 --> 02:22:24.694
TALIESIN: Even that "undead wispy things," is that
triggering anything in the brain?

02:22:24.694 --> 02:22:29.962
MATT: You know, go ahead and make a religion
check. With advantage.

02:22:30.038 --> 02:22:34.307
LIAM: The Gentleman described the research
facility to everybody right? Before they split off?

02:22:34.307 --> 02:22:35.066
MATT: He what?

02:22:35.066 --> 02:22:35.855
LIAM: The Gentleman.

02:22:35.855 --> 02:22:36.717
MATT: Yes.

02:22:36.717 --> 02:22:39.337
LIAM: Described the research facility, the job to
everybody.

02:22:40.165 --> 02:22:43.795
MATT: To everybody who was present at the table
and remained within the vicinity at the moment.

02:22:43.795 --> 02:22:44.788
LIAM: Right. So we all heard that?

02:22:44.788 --> 02:22:45.497
MATT: Yep.

02:22:45.497 --> 02:22:46.640
TALIESIN: 19.

02:22:46.640 --> 02:22:50.726
MATT: Yeah, you're familiar with these entities.
They're generally undead orbs that--

02:22:50.726 --> 02:22:51.997
TALIESIN: Undead orbs.

02:22:51.997 --> 02:23:00.350
MATT: That haunt swamps, haunt areas where they
seek life force to siphon it and devour it.

02:23:00.350 --> 02:23:01.871
They're will-o'-wisps.

02:23:01.871 --> 02:23:04.749
TALIESIN: They're basically will-o'-wisps. You
usually find them in swamps or things like that.

02:23:04.749 --> 02:23:06.591
MARISHA: Okay. Do you know how to fight them?

02:23:06.591 --> 02:23:08.032
TALIESIN: Yes. Am I smoldering?

02:23:08.032 --> 02:23:09.406
MARISHA: You are.

02:23:09.406 --> 02:23:11.185
(chuckles)

02:23:11.185 --> 02:23:12.499
TALIESIN: <i>Yes</i>.

02:23:12.499 --> 02:23:16.483
MARISHA: Yes. It's so good. It's a good movie.

02:23:16.483 --> 02:23:19.862
TALIESIN: I know. Anyway. All right.

02:23:19.862 --> 02:23:21.315
TRAVIS: We'll turn in.

02:23:21.315 --> 02:23:22.752
MATT: All right, you guys all turn in?

02:23:22.752 --> 02:23:24.036
LIAM: Yeah.

02:23:24.036 --> 02:23:28.905
MATT: All right. An evening's rest takes you as
you all take a while, ruminating on the events of

02:23:28.905 --> 02:23:34.334
the day, the information acquired and the path
before you. You eventually find yourselves to

02:23:34.334 --> 02:23:42.236
sleep so you can take your long rests for the
night. Are you doing anything with the sword?

02:23:42.236 --> 02:23:44.324
TRAVIS: With the sword?

02:23:44.324 --> 02:23:45.939
MATT: Yeah.

02:23:47.099 --> 02:23:48.765
SAM: The one-- you mean the--

02:23:48.765 --> 02:23:50.366
MATT: The one that you took from Yasha.

02:23:50.403 --> 02:23:51.200
TRAVIS: Oh.

02:23:51.200 --> 02:23:52.084
MATT: Are you--

02:23:52.084 --> 02:23:53.391
TRAVIS: Not yet.

02:23:53.391 --> 02:24:00.102
MATT: Not yet? Okay. Anybody else? Anything? All
right then. As the morning comes to, you all wake

02:24:00.102 --> 02:24:07.538
up relatively early because you went to bed
relatively early. It's shortly after sunrise. You

02:24:07.538 --> 02:24:13.985
find yourself conscious. Some of the first to
really hit the downstairs tavern for breakfast.

02:24:13.985 --> 02:24:19.827
Food is served, drinks are had and the morning and
day is yours. What do you wish to do?

02:24:20.159 --> 02:24:23.261
TRAVIS: How long does it take to attune to
something? An hour? Shit, maybe I should have--

02:24:23.261 --> 02:24:24.509
MARISHA: A short rest.

02:24:24.509 --> 02:24:25.603
MATT: You can do it if you want.

02:24:25.603 --> 02:24:26.848
MARISHA: Yeah, you could do it if you want.

02:24:26.848 --> 02:24:30.636
TRAVIS: Yeah, I want to try to attune to the
Wastehunter Blade.

02:24:30.636 --> 02:24:38.561
MATT: Okay. So you focus on it and as you lie
there, concentrating on it, you extend the essence

02:24:38.641 --> 02:24:47.949
of whatever pact you've made with this entity into
this weapon. As you finally finish the period of

02:24:47.949 --> 02:24:53.853
time, you hold the blade in front of you and it
vanishes into the pocket.

02:24:55.193 --> 02:24:56.237
TRAVIS: Nice.

02:24:56.656 --> 02:25:02.238
MATT: As you force it to apparate once more in
your grasp and the blade returns, it has the same

02:25:02.238 --> 02:25:08.253
hooked shape, but now this blade is encrusted with
barnacles along the base of it. Edges of it have

02:25:08.253 --> 02:25:13.282
curved around and water continues to drip off
this. It seems to have transferred whatever the

02:25:13.282 --> 02:25:20.879
essence of this pact blade is to this one. At this
moment you realize whatever weapon you seem to

02:25:20.879 --> 02:25:30.040
bond with in this way will carry that same aquatic
essence based on the communion that you've acquired.

02:25:31.579 --> 02:25:36.500
TALIESIN: Did you do this alone or was I in the
room when this happened? I would have loved to

02:25:36.500 --> 02:25:38.003
have watched this.

02:25:38.553 --> 02:25:40.102
TRAVIS: Yeah, you were there.

02:25:41.531 --> 02:25:47.987
TALIESIN: I walk up, get a little uncomfortably
close, put my hand on your chest. The power was in

02:25:47.987 --> 02:25:52.572
you, all along. See you at breakfast!

02:25:52.572 --> 02:25:59.522
LIAM: Oh no. I'm going to scuttle off and go over
to Pumat's. I have just a short little shopping.

02:25:59.522 --> 02:26:00.809
TRAVIS: Oh, I need to go as well.

02:26:00.809 --> 02:26:04.880
LIAM: Oh, you do? Okay. So I'm having bacon down
below, so I will wait until I see you.

02:26:04.880 --> 02:26:06.454
SAM: Anyone need to go to Pumat's?

02:26:06.454 --> 02:26:08.124
TRAVIS: Oh, you know who should come? Yasha.

02:26:08.124 --> 02:26:11.215
SAM: She's never met Pumats Sols.

02:26:11.215 --> 02:26:13.473
ASHLEY: Pumats?

02:26:13.473 --> 02:26:15.501
TRAVIS: Yeah. The Invulnerable Vagrant.

02:26:15.501 --> 02:26:17.324
SAM: It's a quartet. It's a doo-wop group.

02:26:17.324 --> 02:26:18.697
MARISHA: It's crazy.

02:26:18.697 --> 02:26:19.966
SAM: They all sing bass.

02:26:19.966 --> 02:26:21.614
LIAM: You need to let your soul glow.

02:26:21.614 --> 02:26:22.916
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:26:22.916 --> 02:26:27.911
MARISHA: Hey, would you all mind looking in to see
if you find any throwing stars or any throwing

02:26:27.911 --> 02:26:30.895
darts? Here, I'll give you some-- here.

02:26:30.895 --> 02:26:32.146
LIAM: Shuriken?

02:26:32.146 --> 02:26:36.877
MARISHA: Yeah. See, I need something-- I give him
a little bit of gold to see if he--

02:26:36.877 --> 02:26:38.028
MATT: Okay.

02:26:38.028 --> 02:26:39.520
LIAM: How much is a little bit?

02:26:39.520 --> 02:26:42.157
MARISHA: Here. Here's ten gold.

02:26:42.157 --> 02:26:43.234
LIAM: Hey!

02:26:43.234 --> 02:26:45.347
MARISHA: Bring me back the change.

02:26:45.347 --> 02:26:50.594
LIAM: For throwing stars from Pumat. Okay. I will
definitely ask him if he has "throwing stars."

02:26:50.910 --> 02:26:55.613
MARISHA: If he does not have throwing stars ask
for darts or the equivalent. Do not fuck me here,

02:26:55.613 --> 02:26:57.845
Caleb. <i>Do not fuck me</i>.

02:26:57.845 --> 02:27:00.817
LIAM: Not interested, but I will ask about the
items you are looking for.

02:27:00.817 --> 02:27:03.006
SAM: Seems pretty aggressive for a favor.

02:27:03.006 --> 02:27:06.301
MATT: Classic Beauregard.

02:27:07.617 --> 02:27:12.124
TRAVIS: You'll like this. Pumat Sol is-- how would
you describe? Unique?

02:27:12.124 --> 02:27:14.922
LIAM: Well, not one-of-a-kind.

02:27:14.922 --> 02:27:16.042
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

02:27:16.042 --> 02:27:18.415
(laughter)

02:27:18.768 --> 02:27:20.631
TRAVIS: Maybe we should just--

02:27:20.631 --> 02:27:22.336
TALIESIN: Did you just tell a joke?

02:27:22.336 --> 02:27:23.628
LIAM: No.

02:27:23.628 --> 02:27:26.154
TALIESIN: (sighs) It's a shame. It was a very good
one.

02:27:26.154 --> 02:27:27.591
SAM: Germans don't tell jokes.

02:27:27.591 --> 02:27:29.391
(laughter)

02:27:29.391 --> 02:27:30.654
MATT: <i>Zemnians</i>.

02:27:30.654 --> 02:27:33.242
SAM: Zemnians experience only pain.

02:27:33.242 --> 02:27:35.745
(laughter)

02:27:36.043 --> 02:27:39.378
TRAVIS: Anybody else coming to the Invulnerable
Vagrant besides the three of us? Yep, four.

02:27:39.378 --> 02:27:40.348
ASHLEY: What's it called?

02:27:40.348 --> 02:27:41.930
TRAVIS: The Invulnerable Vagrant.

02:27:41.930 --> 02:27:43.106
SAM: Is everybody going to go?

02:27:43.106 --> 02:27:46.771
MARISHA: I'll stay here and watch Horris. Me and
Jester, right.

02:27:46.771 --> 02:27:48.840
MATT: Jester will stay as well. There you go.

02:27:48.840 --> 02:27:51.534
MARISHA: I'm going to go wake him up. He's been
sleeping in. Asshole.

02:27:51.534 --> 02:27:53.353
SAM: (as Jester) "I have the diarrhea."

02:27:53.409 --> 02:27:57.387
(laughter)

02:27:57.387 --> 02:27:58.930
MARISHA: Come on Jester, come on.

02:27:58.930 --> 02:27:59.975
LIAM: Oh man.

02:27:59.975 --> 02:28:01.195
TRAVIS: (as Jester) "Don't make me laugh."

02:28:01.195 --> 02:28:02.078
MATT: Oh, boy.

02:28:02.167 --> 02:28:06.083
LIAM: Laura is texting with a full case of FOMO
right now. Ooh.

02:28:06.083 --> 02:28:08.368
TALIESIN: She's slowly sharpening a blade at home,
just--

02:28:08.368 --> 02:28:10.434
LIAM: We miss you, Laura. Next week.

02:28:10.434 --> 02:28:13.640
TRAVIS: When I come home all the lights will be
off with just a candle and a chair.

02:28:13.640 --> 02:28:17.534
LIAM: When you get home, just the blinds are
open.

02:28:18.334 --> 02:28:21.511
MATT: All righty. So for those of you who are
making your way towards the Pentamarket, you

02:28:21.511 --> 02:28:27.787
eventually find the outskirts of the Invulnerable
Vagrant. You enter the interior and there are two

02:28:27.787 --> 02:28:30.814
other individuals that are doing business with two
of the Pumats.

02:28:30.814 --> 02:28:32.257
TRAVIS: Do we recognize them?

02:28:32.257 --> 02:28:37.701
MATT: You do not. They seem to be just asking
questions and looking about the vicinity.

02:28:37.701 --> 02:28:42.053
MARISHA: Before they leave, can I be like, don't forget, they're looking for us. To Molly.

02:28:42.084 --> 02:28:44.238
TALIESIN: Do I recognize these people?

02:28:44.238 --> 02:28:45.533
MATT: You do not.

02:28:45.533 --> 02:28:51.798
TALIESIN: Okay. I may have the chill cloak
flipped, to try and be a little less conspicuous

02:28:51.798 --> 02:28:54.160
rolling around, for what it's worth.

02:28:54.160 --> 02:28:55.467
MATT: Okay.

02:28:55.467 --> 02:28:57.837
LIAM: You did the artist formerly known as
Prince?

02:29:02.694 --> 02:29:07.137
MATT: So as you enter the chamber and you see the
two Pumats are busy, the counter is currently not

02:29:07.291 --> 02:29:14.628
helmed and they're mid-discussion, but one of them
turns and kind of acknowledges you enter. "Oh,

02:29:14.628 --> 02:29:20.668
that's real nice to see you. Just relax there a
bit. If you need help immediately we can see if

02:29:20.668 --> 02:29:22.348
Prime's available."

02:29:22.348 --> 02:29:28.172
TRAVIS: Well, if you wouldn't mind, this is one of
our compatriots. This is Yasha. New to your establishment.

02:29:28.276 --> 02:29:32.567
MATT: "Yasha. That's a wonderful name. I can't
help you because I'm helping this person, but just

02:29:32.567 --> 02:29:39.069
hang tight a second. Pumat? He'll be right with
you."

02:29:39.069 --> 02:29:41.135
ASHLEY: Isn't he Pumat?

02:29:41.135 --> 02:29:43.700
MATT: You see two of them that look identical in
the room.

02:29:43.700 --> 02:29:45.279
ASHLEY: Oh, you guys are twins?

02:29:45.279 --> 02:29:49.498
MATT: "Something like that. He'll be right with
you." Turns around.

02:29:49.498 --> 02:29:50.791
LIAM: Just breathe it in.

02:29:50.791 --> 02:29:52.057
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:29:52.057 --> 02:29:56.224
MATT: You hear a couple of heavy footfalls, what
sounds like a toppling of some metallic pan that

02:29:56.224 --> 02:30:06.243
(clattering metal) like, "Ah, shi-- hello!" The
curtain opens and you see one of the Pumats, but

02:30:06.243 --> 02:30:12.678
with a set of goggles right above the head, an
apron on with a bunch of different tools and

02:30:12.678 --> 02:30:18.518
various accoutrements stuffed into different
pockets. "Hey, so I'm helping someone. Who needs help?

02:30:18.624 --> 02:30:20.078
TRAVIS: Oh, actually--

02:30:20.078 --> 02:30:21.283
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:30:21.283 --> 02:30:24.307
TRAVIS: This is our friend Yasha. She's new to
your establishment.

02:30:24.307 --> 02:30:25.236
ASHLEY: Hello.

02:30:25.236 --> 02:30:28.493
MATT: "Right. Now, you've been here before. You're
working with the other ones. All right. Morning.

02:30:28.493 --> 02:30:30.675
Morning to you. Hey, can I help you?"

02:30:30.675 --> 02:30:38.249
ASHLEY I just-- I mean, do you have Chinese stars?
Throwing stars?

02:30:38.249 --> 02:30:40.466
MATT: "I don't understand what that is."

02:30:40.466 --> 02:30:47.433
ASHLEY: They're like pointy things that you throw
and they're metal.

02:30:47.433 --> 02:30:52.579
MATT: "Oh. Are you talking about a dagger or a
dart or something like that?"

02:30:52.579 --> 02:30:54.640
ASHLEY: Darts, daggers-- <i>darts</i>.

02:30:57.850 --> 02:31:02.937
MATT: "You can probably go to a blacksmith and get
that made for you. I don't really craft things

02:31:03.015 --> 02:31:09.435
here from their base components. We generally take
them and I enchant them to a better degree. I make

02:31:09.435 --> 02:31:12.898
generally not-so-great things pretty great."

02:31:12.898 --> 02:31:14.122
ASHLEY: Oh!

02:31:14.122 --> 02:31:15.853
LIAM: I gather we all hear this conversation,
yeah?

02:31:15.853 --> 02:31:22.859
MATT: Yeah. And you're catching that Pumat Prime is a
little surlier than the other ones. He seems like

02:31:22.859 --> 02:31:28.363
he's a little more down to business than the
various versions of him out there.

02:31:28.763 --> 02:31:31.640
TALIESIN: We're probably going to be dealing with
some restless spirits actually, so if there's

02:31:31.640 --> 02:31:35.338
anything to deal with some of these
phantasmagorical creatures, will-o'-wisps, that

02:31:35.338 --> 02:31:36.753
sort of thing.

02:31:36.753 --> 02:31:39.884
MATT: "Ah, interesting. You're going to be dealing
with some of the spiritual realm, you say?"

02:31:39.884 --> 02:31:41.886
TALIESIN: Yeah, inevitably.

02:31:41.886 --> 02:31:47.329
MATT: "All right. Let's see. Pretty sure I got
maybe a vial or two of holy water if that's what

02:31:47.329 --> 02:31:53.779
you're looking for. That's not usually my purview,
but we keep a couple in stock just in case. Let me

02:31:53.779 --> 02:32:00.516
see what I can muster." Goes ahead and rummages
through in the back. You hear more metal and glass

02:32:00.516 --> 02:32:06.133
clanking and one box gets shifted off to the side.
"Ah, dang nabbit."

02:32:06.133 --> 02:32:08.245
TRAVIS: Yasha, do you have any healing potions?

02:32:08.245 --> 02:32:17.295
ASHLEY: I don't. That's actually-- I wanted to get
some. Let's see. Just want to double check to see

02:32:17.295 --> 02:32:18.571
if I do.

02:32:20.875 --> 02:32:26.409
MATT: "All righty." Comes out. "I've got two vials
of holy water remaining. Those will run you about

02:32:26.409 --> 02:32:28.509
25 gold pieces apiece if you want them."

02:32:28.509 --> 02:32:31.921
TALIESIN: Perfect. That's exactly what I was
looking for was two vials of holy water.

02:32:31.921 --> 02:32:35.511
MATT: "Well, look at that. It's like it was meant
to be. Straight up destiny."

02:32:35.511 --> 02:32:36.961
SAM: (laughs)

02:32:36.961 --> 02:32:39.564
TALIESIN: Probably need some healing potions or
something?

02:32:39.564 --> 02:32:42.042
ASHLEY: Yeah. Do you have some healing potions?

02:32:42.099 --> 02:32:47.021
MATT: "Ah, well you see, funny thing with all of
these adventurers, keep coming in and clearing me

02:32:47.021 --> 02:32:53.456
out. We got maybe two more, but you got to give us
time to restock. You guys, your friends here have

02:32:53.456 --> 02:32:55.910
been mighty hungry."

02:32:55.910 --> 02:32:58.485
ASHLEY: Well, they're the Mighty Nein.

02:32:58.485 --> 02:33:01.853
(laughter)

02:33:01.853 --> 02:33:03.635
TRAVIS: Oh my god, that head shake afterwards.

02:33:03.635 --> 02:33:04.662
MARISHA: Her initial regret.

02:33:04.662 --> 02:33:05.562
TRAVIS: The bail.

02:33:05.562 --> 02:33:07.273
MARISHA: Immediate nope. Nah.

02:33:07.273 --> 02:33:09.181
ASHLEY: How much are they?

02:33:09.181 --> 02:33:14.809
MATT: "Those will put you back about 50 gold
pieces apiece since we have the friendly discount

02:33:14.809 --> 02:33:21.836
of repeated customers. Isn't that right, one of--
me's? One of the Pumats goes, "That's correct.

02:33:21.836 --> 02:33:26.300
They've been in here a few times." He's like, "All
right. Great. Thank you for looking out there,

02:33:26.300 --> 02:33:28.416
buddy. All right. So--"

02:33:28.553 --> 02:33:32.737
TRAVIS: I'm really glad to hear that friendly
discount's getting even friendlier. That really

02:33:32.737 --> 02:33:34.755
nice cloak you have on the wall.

02:33:34.755 --> 02:33:35.770
MATT: "Yep?"

02:33:35.770 --> 02:33:37.407
TRAVIS: How much is that?

02:33:37.407 --> 02:33:42.568
MATT: "Oh, you're referring to that protection
cloak. Let's see here." (grunts) Takes it off the

02:33:42.568 --> 02:33:45.936
counter, checks it. "That'll run you back about
800 gold pieces."

02:33:45.936 --> 02:33:49.194
TRAVIS: I fell face first into some coin recently.
I think I'll take that.

02:33:49.194 --> 02:33:50.636
SAM: Whoa!

02:33:50.636 --> 02:33:58.257
MATT: "Well." You watch the demeanor shift a
little bit from like the "I'm busy." Like "Well,

02:33:58.257 --> 02:34:04.315
happy to see a big spender coming on first thing
in the morning." You start seeing more of the

02:34:04.315 --> 02:34:06.775
connection with the other Pumats.

02:34:06.775 --> 02:34:09.609
LIAM: Ah, regular Percival de Rolo over here.

02:34:10.678 --> 02:34:15.957
MATT: "Well, might I have your name? I don't think
we've had the pleasure personally."

02:34:15.957 --> 02:34:17.201
TRAVIS: Fjord.

02:34:17.201 --> 02:34:18.439
MATT: "Fjord--?"

02:34:18.439 --> 02:34:20.659
SAM: Tough.

02:34:20.659 --> 02:34:31.619
MATT: "Fjord Tough. Pumat Sol <i>Prime</i>. And I
believe this is now known as "Fjord's Cloak."

02:34:32.923 --> 02:34:46.049
ASHLEY: So does that mean that the-- I've seen a
deal somewhere with somebody, also threw in some

02:34:46.049 --> 02:34:51.042
healing spells when they bought a cloak? Is that a
thing?

02:34:51.042 --> 02:34:53.788
MATT: "You're looking for a discount for the
healing potion?"

02:34:53.788 --> 02:34:55.136
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:34:55.136 --> 02:34:57.485
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

02:34:58.536 --> 02:34:59.932
ASHLEY: My charisma's fucked.

02:34:59.932 --> 02:35:01.464
MATT: I know. But, hey, you never know.

02:35:01.464 --> 02:35:03.215
TRAVIS: I like it.

02:35:03.215 --> 02:35:05.398
LIAM: Yasha and Caleb in Napoleon Dynamite.

02:35:06.790 --> 02:35:08.013
ASHLEY: 14.

02:35:08.013 --> 02:35:16.647
MATT: 14? "You know what? I'm not going to lie.
I'm kind of a fan of the no-nonsense kind of a

02:35:16.647 --> 02:35:23.028
lady. So, sure, I'll throw in a ten gold discount
on each of those healing potions. So that's 80

02:35:23.028 --> 02:35:24.745
gold for you for the two."

02:35:24.745 --> 02:35:27.363
ASHLEY: I'll take them.

02:35:27.363 --> 02:35:29.715
MATT: "All righty. Here you go."

02:35:29.715 --> 02:35:31.447
ASHLEY: Thank you.

02:35:31.447 --> 02:35:33.325
MATT: "Okay."

02:35:33.325 --> 02:35:35.919
LIAM: I'm sorry, I have a simple request.

02:35:35.919 --> 02:35:39.318
MATT: "That's all right. Simple requests are
always open. What do you need?"

02:35:39.318 --> 02:35:47.206
LIAM: About 100 gold worth of ink for transcribing
arcane knowledge.

02:35:47.206 --> 02:35:54.807
MATT: "Yeah, more of that wizard stuff. I got that
for you. I got two ink vials there. Those'll last

02:35:54.807 --> 02:36:01.703
you for a little while. Get that going for you.
Some parchment. 100 gold, friend. Thank you very

02:36:01.703 --> 02:36:04.113
much. Pleasure doing business with you."

02:36:04.113 --> 02:36:06.054
LIAM: I have four gold to my name again.

02:36:06.054 --> 02:36:08.245
SAM: If you need a loan, I can--

02:36:08.245 --> 02:36:09.709
LIAM: Don't worry about it.

02:36:09.709 --> 02:36:11.478
MARISHA: Being a wizard's expensive, <i>ja</i>?

02:36:11.478 --> 02:36:12.934
LIAM: It is. It is.

02:36:12.934 --> 02:36:15.053
ASHLEY: Yeah, I have no money.

02:36:17.333 --> 02:36:19.454
TALIESIN: We'll make some money.

02:36:22.514 --> 02:36:27.324
SAM: Were there any throwing weapons that you
have, even if they're enchanted?

02:36:27.324 --> 02:36:33.559
MATT: "Well, I do have one enchanted dagger, if
you're so interested."

02:36:33.559 --> 02:36:35.785
SAM: Would she like that?

02:36:35.785 --> 02:36:37.690
LIAM: I don't think she would, actually.

02:36:37.690 --> 02:36:40.790
SAM: She doesn't like to throw daggers. She only
likes to throw--

02:36:40.790 --> 02:36:43.044
LIAM: She might, but it doesn't seem her bag.

02:36:43.044 --> 02:36:44.600
SAM: What does it do?

02:36:44.600 --> 02:36:48.787
MATT: "Well this one, when it's thrown, if it
misses, it comes right back to you."

02:36:48.787 --> 02:36:50.310
SAM: It comes right back to you?

02:36:50.310 --> 02:36:51.391
MATT: "If it misses."

02:36:51.391 --> 02:36:53.034
SAM: A dagger that comes back to you?

02:36:53.034 --> 02:36:54.320
MATT: "If you miss with it."

02:36:54.320 --> 02:36:56.292
SAM: Caleb, did you hear that?

02:36:56.292 --> 02:36:57.816
LIAM: Sounds like bullshit to me.

02:36:57.816 --> 02:36:59.480
SAM: That's incredible.

02:36:59.480 --> 02:37:01.489
MATT: "It's pretty useful. I don't know about
incredible."

02:37:01.489 --> 02:37:03.138
TRAVIS: If you miss with it.

02:37:05.174 --> 02:37:09.195
MATT: "Look, I'm just being straight with you.
It's a pretty useful thing on occasion."

02:37:09.195 --> 02:37:11.094
LIAM: What about yourself?

02:37:11.094 --> 02:37:15.357
SAM: Oh, I'm fine. He's already-- they're already
making me something.

02:37:16.540 --> 02:37:20.846
LIAM: Yeah, but I've seen you throw a dagger or
two in your time and you always have to walk out

02:37:20.846 --> 02:37:25.320
to the tree and pull it out or walk out to the
gnoll and pull it out. This way it would come

02:37:25.320 --> 02:37:28.153
right back to you. Think about it.

02:37:28.153 --> 02:37:33.917
SAM: Throwing a dagger just seems so inelegant to
me. I don't know why. They're meant to cut food

02:37:33.917 --> 02:37:36.024
and to eat food with.

02:37:36.024 --> 02:37:40.706
MATT: "I mean no offense to any of you here, but I
got to get right back to work. Looks like one of

02:37:40.706 --> 02:37:44.070
my me's is available to help you for the rest of
this--"

02:37:44.070 --> 02:37:46.000
LIAM: I understand. If she changes her mind, we'll
let you know.

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:49.496
MATT: "Yeah, no, well, let them know. Thank you so
much. Have a wonderful day. It's a pleasure to see

02:37:49.496 --> 02:37:51.788
you again. You too."

02:37:51.788 --> 02:37:53.146
ASHLEY: Nice to meet you.

02:37:53.146 --> 02:37:58.244
MATT: "Nice to meet you as well, big lady." He
takes his goggles down. "Have a good day." He

02:37:58.244 --> 02:38:02.022
turns around and goes into the back chamber. It's
funny, him saying big lady, because he's huge.

02:38:02.022 --> 02:38:07.358
He's bigger than you are. He goes into the back
and goes right back to work and you hear another

02:38:07.358 --> 02:38:11.750
foot hit the pan. "Ah, I need to-- aw man."

02:38:11.750 --> 02:38:14.108
LIAM: How high are the ceilings in this store?

02:38:14.108 --> 02:38:16.324
MATT: The ceiling's probably about ten-foot.

02:38:16.324 --> 02:38:22.994
LIAM: I low how your voice went (low voice) to
(imitating Matt) "The ceiling's about--" Okay. Got it.

02:38:23.374 --> 02:38:29.377
MATT: "Hi. Sorry about that. I was helping a
customer, but he's left now. Not purchasing

02:38:29.377 --> 02:38:33.470
anything. So I'm happy to help you. What can I do
for you?"

02:38:33.470 --> 02:38:36.463
TALIESIN: I think we're pretty well taken care of
at this point.

02:38:36.463 --> 02:38:38.381
TRAVIS: We got everything we need.

02:38:38.381 --> 02:38:45.206
MATT: "All righty. Well, have a wonderful day and
come by whenever you like, big spender. I saw that."

02:38:45.969 --> 02:38:48.323
SAM: Is my flask coming along all right?

02:38:48.323 --> 02:38:52.516
MATT: "Coming along fine. I think that's part of
what Pumat's working on right now."

02:38:52.516 --> 02:39:00.710
SAM: Add any sort of shiny finish to it or some
extra flair or baubles to it, that would be fine.

02:39:00.710 --> 02:39:03.249
MATT: "I'll see what we can do. Thank you."

02:39:03.249 --> 02:39:04.319
SAM: Thank you.

02:39:04.319 --> 02:39:05.306
MATT: "Thank you."

02:39:05.306 --> 02:39:06.851
SAM: All right. Thank <i>you</i>.

02:39:06.851 --> 02:39:08.047
MATT: All right. Thank you.

02:39:09.679 --> 02:39:14.642
TRAVIS: We leave. Unique, huh?

02:39:14.642 --> 02:39:22.588
ASHLEY: That's a-- I've never seen any-- I thought
they were related and then they all have the same

02:39:22.588 --> 02:39:24.607
name so I guess that's another thing.

02:39:24.812 --> 02:39:29.551
TRAVIS: Yeah. You're quite the word wizard with
the haggling there.

02:39:29.551 --> 02:39:36.212
ASHLEY: Listen. I realize I'm not great with
people. Just no need to point it out.

02:39:36.212 --> 02:39:38.833
TRAVIS: I was being honest. You actually got money
off.

02:39:38.833 --> 02:39:43.776
ASHLEY: Oh. I forgot about that. Yes, I did.

02:39:43.776 --> 02:39:45.234
TRAVIS: Yeah, nice job.

02:39:45.234 --> 02:39:46.790
TALIESIN: I've never seen you blush before.

02:39:46.790 --> 02:39:49.627
LIAM: She is quite pale. It's hard to tell.

02:39:51.567 --> 02:39:53.608
ASHLEY: Well, what do we need--

02:39:54.108 --> 02:39:56.679
TRAVIS: She doesn't like the spotlight.

02:39:59.491 --> 02:40:01.208
LIAM: Attention's a bitch, isn't it?

02:40:01.208 --> 02:40:02.620
ASHLEY and LIAM: Yeah.

02:40:02.620 --> 02:40:04.294
TRAVIS: <i>Nein</i>!

02:40:04.294 --> 02:40:06.212
ASHLEY: <i>Nein.</i>

02:40:06.423 --> 02:40:08.242
TALIESIN: We should probably go to the blacksmith
at some point.

02:40:08.242 --> 02:40:11.621
MATT: Easily enough at the blacksmith, for the
sake of brevity here. Yeah, you can pick up--

02:40:11.621 --> 02:40:14.137
LIAM: A thousand throwing stars.

02:40:14.137 --> 02:40:18.654
MARISHA: Yeah, for ten gold. Just ball bearings
and throwing stars.

02:40:18.654 --> 02:40:27.921
MATT: For a single dart, which is the equivalent.
We'll say there are darts and there are, we'll say

02:40:27.921 --> 02:40:33.382
throwing stars. Sure, why not? Because of the
Archive's nearby, there probably would be a use

02:40:33.382 --> 02:40:38.272
for them. They're not often called for. It's
probably a surprise that somebody wanted to

02:40:38.272 --> 02:40:44.404
purchase them, but they have about 20, we'll say,
throwing stars, which act as darts, for five

02:40:44.404 --> 02:40:46.248
copper a piece.

02:40:46.248 --> 02:40:51.337
LIAM: I hand Yasha one of the ten gold that Beau
gave me. This is Beau's money, so I think she'd

02:40:51.337 --> 02:40:53.154
want you to purchase them.

02:40:53.154 --> 02:40:54.866
ASHLEY: Well, she gave you the money.

02:40:54.866 --> 02:40:57.073
LIAM: Yeah, but she doesn't like me very much.

02:40:57.073 --> 02:40:59.538
ASHLEY: Well maybe that will make her like you
more.

02:40:59.538 --> 02:41:01.084
LIAM: That's doubtful.

02:41:01.084 --> 02:41:04.224
ASHLEY: Why do you think that?

02:41:04.224 --> 02:41:10.521
LIAM: Why do I think it's doubtful she will like
me? She has threatened me constantly. She is very

02:41:10.521 --> 02:41:16.279
aggressive. She's very surly. She doesn't smile a
lot unless there is a spell cast on her. I've only

02:41:16.279 --> 02:41:19.252
seen her punch people in the face.

02:41:19.252 --> 02:41:21.580
TALIESIN: Has she punched you in the face yet?

02:41:21.580 --> 02:41:23.642
LIAM: Give her time.

02:41:23.642 --> 02:41:25.828
TALIESIN: I think she likes you.

02:41:25.828 --> 02:41:28.607
ASHLEY: The only reason I might disagree is
because she did give you money.

02:41:29.417 --> 02:41:31.786
TALIESIN: I'll take that money. It'll be no
problem.

02:41:32.924 --> 02:41:36.637
LIAM: I give one gold to Yasha and I hold on to
the other nine.

02:41:37.549 --> 02:41:39.573
ALL: <i>Nein</i>.

02:41:39.573 --> 02:41:41.239
ASHLEY: What are you going to do with the rest of
the money?

02:41:41.239 --> 02:41:42.849
LIAM: I'm going to give it back to her.

02:41:43.412 --> 02:41:47.743
TALIESIN: We can, to be fair, get all 20 of those
throwing darts for one gold.

02:41:47.743 --> 02:41:49.242
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:41:49.671 --> 02:41:55.141
MATT: Okay. So the transaction completed, you have
a bunch of these throwing stars. They're metallic.

02:41:55.141 --> 02:42:00.548
They're triangular in shape and bladed at the
edges. Pretty light.

02:42:01.370 --> 02:42:03.104
ASHLEY: Can I test one out?

02:42:03.104 --> 02:42:05.527
MATT: Sure. Go ahead and roll a d20.

02:42:05.527 --> 02:42:06.636
TALIESIN: Yeah!

02:42:08.596 --> 02:42:14.523
ASHLEY: Nope. Seven. No, sorry. Nine.

02:42:14.523 --> 02:42:17.417
ALL: <i>Nein</i>!

02:42:17.417 --> 02:42:23.035
MATT: You throw it towards this post and it
(whoosh). (whinnies) This horse all of a sudden

02:42:23.035 --> 02:42:27.985
bucks and kicks the side of the stable nearby and
you hear the wood crack from the kick. All of the

02:42:27.985 --> 02:42:31.851
sudden you hear voices of the two stable hands
trying to hold back this horse. So it's 19

02:42:31.851 --> 02:42:33.089
throwing stars.

02:42:33.089 --> 02:42:34.381
ASHLEY: Fuck, sorry.

02:42:34.474 --> 02:42:35.904
TALIESIN: It was worth it.

02:42:39.129 --> 02:42:44.162
ASHLEY: Admittedly, I'm not good at throwing
things, but it looked really cool.

02:42:44.162 --> 02:42:46.993
TRAVIS: Did we bring Horris with us?

02:42:46.993 --> 02:42:53.254
MARISHA: No, I'm watching him. While you guys are
doing this, I'm like: Check under your bed. Did

02:42:53.254 --> 02:42:58.425
you leave anything behind? Go pee. One last time,
man. Come on, come on.

02:42:58.425 --> 02:43:00.101
LIAM: Too real for me, too real.

02:43:00.185 --> 02:43:02.981
TRAVIS: Camp counselor Beau. Incredible.

02:43:08.024 --> 02:43:12.436
MATT: Caleb, Molly, and Jester, actually, as you
guys are walking back, you notice that there are

02:43:12.492 --> 02:43:20.357
now clusters of about three or four crownsguard at
different places that are in the process of asking

02:43:20.357 --> 02:43:24.235
questions to people, going from place to place and
inquiring.

02:43:24.235 --> 02:43:31.466
TALIESIN: I am going to turn around and
immediately head towards the other bar. The

02:43:31.466 --> 02:43:33.041
Evening Nip.

02:43:33.041 --> 02:43:34.749
SAM: Jester's not with us.

02:43:34.749 --> 02:43:36.722
MATT: Right, she's not with you. You're right.

02:43:36.722 --> 02:43:39.264
TALIESIN: I'm going to let you know. Tell them I'm
hiding at the bar and I'll meet them there when

02:43:39.264 --> 02:43:40.076
it's time.

02:43:44.326 --> 02:43:46.275
LIAM: We see guards asking around?

02:43:46.334 --> 02:43:48.854
MATT: Yeah, like talking to people, asking
questions.

02:43:50.004 --> 02:43:55.737
LIAM: Okay. I am just going to pull my cloak up
and put the hood up. That's all.

02:43:55.881 --> 02:44:01.690
MATT: Okay. You guys make your way back to The
Leaky Tap. There, what little Horris had on him, a

02:44:01.690 --> 02:44:06.191
little bit of change and materials to leave, is
ready to go. Beau and Jester are propped and ready

02:44:06.191 --> 02:44:09.583
as well, I assume? What do you guys do?

02:44:09.583 --> 02:44:12.439
SAM: Should we go on our mission or should we get
rid of Horris?

02:44:12.439 --> 02:44:13.997
TRAVIS: Well, we're dropping him off.

02:44:13.997 --> 02:44:15.282
LIAM: Well, Horris is part of the mission.

02:44:15.282 --> 02:44:16.961
TRAVIS: Yeah we'll be dropping him off at The
Evening Nip.

02:44:16.961 --> 02:44:20.195
LIAM: We should go. Let's make hay while the sun
shines.

02:44:20.195 --> 02:44:24.184
SAM: Drop off Horris and then go. Do we know where
we're going for this mission?

02:44:24.184 --> 02:44:25.585
TRAVIS: A mile out of town.

02:44:25.585 --> 02:44:28.658
MARISHA: The Evening Nip, and then they're going
to escort us out.

02:44:28.658 --> 02:44:29.792
SAM: Okay.

02:44:29.792 --> 02:44:31.134
TRAVIS: We'll be blinded.

02:44:31.134 --> 02:44:34.878
ASHLEY: Beau, Caleb got these for you.

02:44:34.878 --> 02:44:38.375
MARISHA: (gasps) Perfect! Thank you.

02:44:38.375 --> 02:44:42.618
ASHLEY: There were 20, but one of them fell out of
the bag.

02:44:42.618 --> 02:44:49.551
LIAM: Yes, they were so heavy and I am so weak
that I gave them to Yasha to carry. Here's your change.

02:44:49.957 --> 02:44:54.009
MARISHA: Thank you. Why are you acting so weird
about this?

02:44:54.009 --> 02:44:56.356
LIAM: I'm just weird in general.

02:44:57.326 --> 02:45:00.214
MARISHA: Thanks for the change. Thank you, Yasha.

02:45:00.703 --> 02:45:05.125
ASHLEY: One of them's missing, but I think it fell
out of the--

02:45:05.125 --> 02:45:09.017
SAM: It was an accident. There was nothing
suspicious about it.

02:45:09.017 --> 02:45:12.565
ASHLEY: I think it fell out of the bag.

02:45:12.902 --> 02:45:18.501
TRAVIS: We should go. Okay. Horris, we're going to
try and get you out of here.

02:45:18.501 --> 02:45:21.167
MATT: "Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Whatever you
need."

02:45:23.577 --> 02:45:24.615
TRAVIS: What?

02:45:25.685 --> 02:45:27.854
LIAM: This is a Liam thing, not a Caleb thing.

02:45:27.854 --> 02:45:29.046
MATT: Yeah?

02:45:29.046 --> 02:45:35.535
LIAM: I'm just going to say, right now, where we
are, Frumpkin, I'm telling him to follow us all,

02:45:35.535 --> 02:45:39.927
about 55 to 60 feet back behind us.

02:45:39.927 --> 02:45:46.496
MATT: Okay. Easy enough. All right. As you guys
make your way towards The Evening Nip, Horris is

02:45:46.496 --> 02:45:51.465
looking a bit nervous, but does look around and
seems genuinely very thankful. He's like,

02:45:51.465 --> 02:45:57.474
"Seriously, this means a lot. To both me and
Dolan. Thank you."

02:45:57.474 --> 02:46:01.816
MARISHA: Yeah, you're welcome. And then I put a
bag over his head and I say sorry, sorry.

02:46:01.816 --> 02:46:04.798
TRAVIS: I think that can probably wait until we
are at The Evening Nip.

02:46:04.798 --> 02:46:06.480
MARISHA: Well, he can't see where we're going,
right?

02:46:06.480 --> 02:46:10.153
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure he can. We just don't want
crownsguard thinking we're walking around a hooded person.

02:46:10.266 --> 02:46:13.286
MARISHA: I figured we're-- All right.

02:46:13.286 --> 02:46:15.727
MATT: Probably hold on that until we get-- We'll
say, for the purposes of this, you're pretty close

02:46:15.727 --> 02:46:17.570
to The Evening Nip when you do this.

02:46:17.570 --> 02:46:20.102
TRAVIS: Okay. We made it. Now's the time.

02:46:20.102 --> 02:46:22.502
MARISHA: Okay, okay. Now over his head.

02:46:22.833 --> 02:46:24.483
LIAM: 6:00am, wake up!

02:46:24.483 --> 02:46:27.938
TRAVIS: We're just pushing around a guy with a bag
on his head. Hey! Nah, it's cool.

02:46:27.938 --> 02:46:30.116
MATT: He's had too much to drink?

02:46:30.116 --> 02:46:32.529
MARISHA: He's going through a Jake Gyllenhaal
phase.

02:46:32.529 --> 02:46:33.980
TRAVIS: (high pitched) His eyes are dilated.

02:46:33.980 --> 02:46:36.192
LIAM: Happy Halloween!

02:46:36.917 --> 02:46:46.748
MATT: You guys enter The Evening Nip. Clive is
there at the end. "Hey. You're a friend with a bag?"

02:46:48.187 --> 02:46:53.091
TRAVIS: We made arrangements with The Gentleman
downstairs.

02:46:53.091 --> 02:46:59.679
MATT: "All right." (grunts) He leads you to the
back, shoves things off of the latch, pulls up the

02:46:59.679 --> 02:47:05.983
trapdoor, down the stairs, and you eventually make
your way back into the tavern below, where

02:47:05.983 --> 02:47:10.185
Mollymauk is waiting nervously, drinking.

02:47:10.185 --> 02:47:15.519
LIAM: I don't like the proximity here. Frumpkin's
gone, out there. Then once we're in the

02:47:15.519 --> 02:47:17.561
speakeasy-- sorry, I just ate a cracker.

02:47:17.561 --> 02:47:18.362
MATT: That's okay.

02:47:18.362 --> 02:47:19.841
LIAM: Frumpkin's under a table.

02:47:19.841 --> 02:47:26.618
MATT: Okay. Gotcha. All right. As you guys head
back down, Horris is like, "I trust you guys. I

02:47:26.618 --> 02:47:32.977
trust you." You make your way down. The room is
not as busy as it was last you left. There's maybe

02:47:32.977 --> 02:47:37.952
six individuals in there. Most of them are the
individuals who were previously posted with rifles

02:47:37.952 --> 02:47:43.032
or new individuals also posted with rifles up at
the top. There is The Gentleman, finishing a meal

02:47:43.032 --> 02:47:53.583
at the table with Sorah, his bodyguard, at the
side. "Ah! I see you've made it." He sets the

02:47:53.583 --> 02:48:01.517
things down, pushes the plate to the side. "So I
take it this is your contraband?"

02:48:02.867 --> 02:48:03.954
SAM: Yes.

02:48:04.670 --> 02:48:15.122
MATT: "Very well. And you would wish this
smuggling to head where? Our cleanest, to be fair,

02:48:15.122 --> 02:48:20.259
our cleanest means of smuggling out would be
actually through the river after you pass through,

02:48:20.259 --> 02:48:24.727
as that leads us to the northern swamps of
Berleben. And that would be probably one of the

02:48:24.727 --> 02:48:33.351
safest spaces still easily able to keep him out of
sight and to a safe space out of the Crownsguard's watch."

02:48:33.865 --> 02:48:36.280
TRAVIS: Outstanding. We defer to your expertise.

02:48:36.280 --> 02:48:40.958
MATT: "Great. Then we'll wait an hour after your
passage forward and send your contraband on his

02:48:40.958 --> 02:48:49.388
way to safety with two individuals to escort him
and lead him to civilization beyond the outskirts.

02:48:50.388 --> 02:48:51.444
Sound fair?"

02:48:51.906 --> 02:48:52.498
SAM: Yes.

02:48:52.498 --> 02:48:53.403
TRAVIS: Sounds fair.

02:48:53.403 --> 02:49:00.724
MATT: "Very well. Take care of him, please." They
pull the shoulders of Horris back and Horris is

02:49:00.724 --> 02:49:04.716
like, "All right. Be safe."

02:49:04.716 --> 02:49:07.740
TRAVIS: It's all right. Go with them. You'll be
fine.

02:49:07.740 --> 02:49:18.126
MATT: "And you know what? Kara and, we'll say,
Dweez. You go ahead and lead them down to the--"

02:49:19.186 --> 02:49:20.429
SAM: Dweez.

02:49:21.109 --> 02:49:26.695
MATT: "Lead them, blindfolded of course, through
the underworks to docks and send them up the way

02:49:26.695 --> 02:49:34.792
to their agreed upon task." You see Kara come back
through one of the doors on the steps and behind,

02:49:34.792 --> 02:49:38.458
you see that creepy gnome from earlier sitting
behind.

02:49:38.458 --> 02:49:39.806
MARISHA: Dweez.

02:49:40.050 --> 02:49:48.127
MATT: (creepy chuckling) Kara goes, "All right.
Well," and she pulls a few pieces of cloth. It

02:49:48.127 --> 02:49:52.917
looks like they're used to moving individuals
through, and they have already prepared blindfolds

02:49:52.917 --> 02:50:00.004
in place. She passes them out to you and instructs
you all to put on a blindfold and take a hand.

02:50:04.764 --> 02:50:09.249
LIAM: As soon as the blindfold is on, I'm going to
pass my sight and hearing over to Frumpkin.

02:50:09.599 --> 02:50:11.004
MARISHA: Nice!

02:50:11.004 --> 02:50:13.352
TALIESIN: That's a good call.

02:50:13.352 --> 02:50:15.423
LIAM: If it works.

02:50:15.423 --> 02:50:18.351
MARISHA: I'll hold on to Caleb to make sure he can
still walk.

02:50:18.351 --> 02:50:19.790
MATT: Okay.

02:50:19.790 --> 02:50:21.736
LIAM: Thanks, blind woman.

02:50:21.736 --> 02:50:24.660
MARISHA: Well, they said all hold hands.

02:50:24.660 --> 02:50:26.153
LIAM: Okay. Yeah. (boof)

02:50:26.153 --> 02:50:27.956
MATT: Who's at the very front and who's at the
very back of this chain?

02:50:27.956 --> 02:50:29.001
TRAVIS: I'll stay at the front.

02:50:29.001 --> 02:50:31.113
MARISHA: Sorry. Doing the best I can. Sorry.

02:50:31.201 --> 02:50:32.138
LIAM: (whack) Sorry!

02:50:32.138 --> 02:50:33.049
MATT: Fjord front.

02:50:33.049 --> 02:50:34.610
MARISHA: Sorry! Had to get an opportunity in.

02:50:34.610 --> 02:50:35.640
MATT: Who's in the back?

02:50:35.640 --> 02:50:37.173
TRAVIS: Wouldn't mind having some muscle up
front.

02:50:37.173 --> 02:50:40.206
ASHLEY: Okay. I'll be behind Grog-- Fjord.

02:50:40.206 --> 02:50:41.547
TALIESIN: I'll go behind Yasha.

02:50:41.547 --> 02:50:43.117
MATT: Okay, who's after Mollymauk?

02:50:43.117 --> 02:50:44.442
TRAVIS: Jester?

02:50:44.442 --> 02:50:47.263
MATT: Jester, all right. Who's after Jester?

02:50:47.263 --> 02:50:49.415
MARISHA: I'm with Caleb in the back.

02:50:49.415 --> 02:50:51.720
MATT: Okay. Nott?

02:50:51.720 --> 02:50:53.979
SAM: I'll hold onto Caleb as well.

02:50:53.979 --> 02:50:55.860
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's a good order.

02:50:55.860 --> 02:50:58.892
MATT: So there, and we have Frumpkin trailing
behind at the very back. So Fjord, at the very

02:50:58.892 --> 02:51:02.704
front, Kara takes your hand and begins pulling,
and in the very, very back, Caleb, this tiny gnome

02:51:02.704 --> 02:51:07.957
hand grabs your hand and goes, "(heh heh) Hold on.
(heh heh)."

02:51:07.957 --> 02:51:09.954
LIAM: This is okay.

02:51:11.354 --> 02:51:17.326
MATT: They loop you through the room a few times
to discombobulate you, and direction in the

02:51:17.424 --> 02:51:23.194
chamber, and pull you through in different ways,
to prevent you from orienting where you were and

02:51:23.194 --> 02:51:29.123
where you're going. Eventually you're led through
a doorway, you hear some things shift, and then

02:51:29.123 --> 02:51:35.510
turned around a bit, and then led down a ladder.
The ladder goes down for about 20 or so feet

02:51:35.510 --> 02:51:48.301
before your feet touch some sort of soft dirt,
packed dirt-type feeling. The sound of the music

02:51:48.301 --> 02:51:53.226
and chatter vanishes up ahead and you hear, as
soon as you all head down the ladder, a latch

02:51:53.226 --> 02:51:56.531
close and lock above you.

02:51:56.531 --> 02:51:57.705
LIAM: How did my cat do?

02:51:57.705 --> 02:52:00.126
MATT: Your cat managed to-- actually, make a
stealth check.

02:52:00.126 --> 02:52:01.946
MARISHA: Come on, kitty! Come on, Frumpkin!

02:52:01.946 --> 02:52:03.235
MATT: For Frumpkin.

02:52:03.479 --> 02:52:04.813
LIAM: Oh shit.

02:52:04.813 --> 02:52:05.808
TRAVIS: What?

02:52:05.808 --> 02:52:07.564
LIAM: Total shit. Five!

02:52:07.564 --> 02:52:08.829
MATT: Five?

02:52:08.829 --> 02:52:10.365
LIAM: Yes.

02:52:10.365 --> 02:52:17.218
MATT: As Frumpkin's trying to trail behind, Dweez
turns and goes, "(heh) No! (heh heh)" and puts a

02:52:17.218 --> 02:52:21.066
hand out and grabs Frumpkin by the scruff and
holds Frumpkin up, and then throws Frumpkin back

02:52:21.066 --> 02:52:22.631
into the bar.

02:52:22.631 --> 02:52:27.460
LIAM: Okay. If I saw that, I would snap my fingers
and make Frumpkin poof out.

02:52:27.460 --> 02:52:28.737
MATT: Okay.

02:52:28.737 --> 02:52:30.767
LIAM: I'm going to bite my tongue and bring
Frumpkin back.

02:52:30.767 --> 02:52:36.122
MATT: Okay. Dweez is clutching the back of your
hand and goes, (confused sound).

02:52:36.122 --> 02:52:39.707
LIAM: It's just a nervous tic. I'm a nervous
fellow. Sorry.

02:52:39.707 --> 02:52:41.612
MATT: (creepy laughter)

02:52:41.612 --> 02:52:43.522
TRAVIS: What the fuck?! (laughs)

02:52:43.522 --> 02:52:52.876
MATT: Okay. So you head back down. You are led
down a tunnel. It weaves a bit. You turn to the

02:52:52.876 --> 02:52:58.454
right, down another tunnel for 100, 200, 300 feet.

02:52:58.454 --> 02:52:59.918
LIAM: (snaps fingers) Frumpkin back in.

02:52:59.918 --> 02:53:01.175
MATT: Frumpkin back in.

02:53:01.175 --> 02:53:02.457
LIAM: 50 feet behind.

02:53:02.457 --> 02:53:07.095
MATT: Right. You can see this a bit. These are
tight, individual tunnels. It feels almost like a

02:53:07.095 --> 02:53:12.497
mine in the fact that it has occasionally a wood
structure for support between it. A lot of it is

02:53:12.497 --> 02:53:16.307
packed with earth that's been carved out.
Eventually you'll split off into two and you'll

02:53:16.307 --> 02:53:21.291
see what looks to be a small resting chamber with
another set of tables and a bunk. You go past

02:53:21.291 --> 02:53:27.714
another area and there's occasional torchlight set
up on parts of the wall. You can see a couple of

02:53:27.714 --> 02:53:32.047
shifty individuals that are in the process of
stacking crates somewhere.

02:53:32.047 --> 02:53:34.206
LIAM: There's other people down here doing shit as
we walk by.

02:53:34.206 --> 02:53:41.788
MATT: Yeah. They'll walk by you and occasionally
look. One of them will stop and inspect and move

02:53:41.788 --> 02:53:46.358
on. No one seems to fuck with you at the minute
because you're with Kara. In fact, one of them

02:53:46.447 --> 02:53:52.407
seems to get close to you and looks and sees Dweez
and goes (ugh) and just moves on. You do hear a

02:53:52.407 --> 02:53:59.809
noise, a strange like (guttural animal snorting)
and you hear (whip crack) (animal grunting)

02:53:59.809 --> 02:54:06.782
echoing down the hall. You move around one spot
and there's one archway that Frumpkin passes by,

02:54:06.782 --> 02:54:13.008
looking down, and you can see there's a pit, and
there are a number of cages set up in there, about

02:54:13.136 --> 02:54:17.452
four of them, that have different creatures
inside. It's too low-lit for Frumpkin to really

02:54:17.452 --> 02:54:23.744
see from this distance what's in there, but one of
them is currently having a bit of a conniption fit

02:54:23.744 --> 02:54:29.784
and you see three cloaked figures that are on the
outside. One of them is trying to whip elements of

02:54:29.784 --> 02:54:34.150
it that are coming at it; the other one is trying
to prod it in the sides and it's getting agitated.

02:54:34.242 --> 02:54:39.003
LIAM: (as Jester) Jester has a question. She would
like to know what it smells like in here.

02:54:39.003 --> 02:54:49.200
MATT: At this point, it smells like wet dirt and
earth. That's about it. It smells like a dank

02:54:49.200 --> 02:54:58.595
subterranean tunnel. As you pass by the creature
smell, you can smell hints of dung, fresh and old,

02:54:58.595 --> 02:55:06.169
and some sort of pheromone, like a very strong
pheromone that's very unpleasant, the scent.

02:55:08.532 --> 02:55:16.414
Continuing on, you move through another tunnel.
Another figure walks by and stops as you pass and

02:55:16.414 --> 02:55:23.415
watches you as you continue. Down another set of
stairs, and then eventually, the echo begins to

02:55:23.415 --> 02:55:30.379
get a little louder. Your feet hit wood. Frumpkin
can see this as you pass in. You've hit a dock.

02:55:30.379 --> 02:55:37.001
This is now a natural cavern. The moisture catches
you first. What was initially a somewhat cavernous

02:55:37.001 --> 02:55:42.434
damp has now become very moist and you can hear
the slight sound of a river moving through.

02:55:42.434 --> 02:55:46.758
Frumpkin can see this, too. There's an entire
underground river that is now curving past this

02:55:46.758 --> 02:55:51.920
entrance way, leading in two different directions.
Along this river, you can see there are a few

02:55:51.920 --> 02:55:57.537
lanterns that are set up with this soft, greenish
glow. They're perpetually burning in certain areas

02:55:57.537 --> 02:56:03.562
and are bolted into the rock and stone. There on
the side of this dock, you can see four different

02:56:03.562 --> 02:56:10.571
boats that are currently roped and tied to the
edge there. There is a figure sitting on a stool

02:56:10.571 --> 02:56:16.698
who is taking a dagger and moving it on the edge
of one of the wooden poles that is on the very

02:56:16.698 --> 02:56:24.844
outside end of the dock. At this point, all of
your blindfolds are removed and you've come to the

02:56:24.844 --> 02:56:27.281
end of this part of the journey.

02:56:27.281 --> 02:56:28.378
SAM: Oh.

02:56:28.378 --> 02:56:34.494
MATT: Kara says, "Sorry about that, but you were
respectful. Thank you." She collects the

02:56:34.494 --> 02:56:39.543
blindfolds, and Dweez, who is still clutching your
hand, lets go and goes (creepy chuckle).

02:56:39.543 --> 02:56:41.176
SAM: Ugh.

02:56:44.486 --> 02:56:49.793
MATT: Kara goes, "All right. Two of these ships
are yours to use. You're heading up that path

02:56:50.128 --> 02:56:57.932
there about a mile or so. It's with the river,
thankfully, so the stream will be carrying you

02:56:57.932 --> 02:57:05.774
through. A set of paddles to each of you. Whoever
wants to helm that; that's up to you. Pay

02:57:05.774 --> 02:57:10.707
attention: from what I've been told, you'll see
the change in the texture of the wall on the

02:57:10.707 --> 02:57:18.125
left-hand side traveling northward. Look for the
small collapse on that end."

02:57:18.125 --> 02:57:20.291
TRAVIS: Collapse in the wall.

02:57:20.291 --> 02:57:28.695
MATT: "Correct. Be spry. Sometimes some creatures
do find their way living down here, so be ready to

02:57:28.695 --> 02:57:32.516
move past quickly or find a way to duck them if
you can."

02:57:32.516 --> 02:57:35.379
TRAVIS: We can take it from here.

02:57:35.379 --> 02:57:38.727
MATT: "All right. Good luck!"

02:57:38.727 --> 02:57:40.869
SAM: Thank you.

02:57:40.869 --> 02:57:43.451
TRAVIS: You'll be able to find your way back,
right?

02:57:43.451 --> 02:57:46.507
MATT: "We'll be fine."

02:57:46.507 --> 02:57:48.162
TRAVIS: I'm not good at joking.

02:57:48.162 --> 02:57:52.355
MATT: The guy at the edge of the docks sits up and
Kara goes, "The back two for these folks. Let them

02:57:52.355 --> 02:57:59.613
go. Gentleman's orders." He doesn't say anything,
just sits up. You see the hood that's up, he pulls

02:57:59.613 --> 02:58:06.553
it back a bit and you can see there is this older,
grizzled human with very short gray hair, deep

02:58:06.553 --> 02:58:11.285
scar across the back of his head that curves off
to the top of where his receding hairline is. It's

02:58:11.285 --> 02:58:18.163
just been very deep-set where the skin dimples
heavily along the edge of the scar. He's got this

02:58:18.163 --> 02:58:25.571
very scruffy gray and white beard. His head's a
bit sunk into his shoulders. He walks over to the

02:58:25.571 --> 02:58:31.793
edge and unties each of the boats and hands the
rope to one of you. The first one goes to Fjord,

02:58:31.793 --> 02:58:36.684
and the other one just goes to Beau, goes back to
his station and sits down, sticks his blade in the

02:58:36.757 --> 02:58:40.201
side of the wood and keeps wedging it in there.
You get a better look up there and you can see

02:58:40.201 --> 02:58:46.111
this wood is splintered to shit on the top. This
guy has been, over time, slowly pushing away at

02:58:46.111 --> 02:58:50.406
this wood for whatever amusement he needs to pass
the time down here where he's stationed.

02:58:50.406 --> 02:58:52.890
TRAVIS: These boats look like they'll fit three to
four each?

02:58:52.890 --> 02:58:55.330
MATT: These boats look like they'll fit about four
people each.

02:58:55.330 --> 02:59:00.750
TRAVIS: Okay. All right. Two boats. Jester's in
mine. Yasha, you should go in the second boat.

02:59:00.750 --> 02:59:03.122
We're going to need muscle in case we need to move
fast.

02:59:03.122 --> 02:59:04.531
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:59:04.531 --> 02:59:07.874
LIAM: I get in with Nott. In the Yasha boat.

02:59:07.874 --> 02:59:10.282
SAM: Who's piloting our boat?

02:59:10.282 --> 02:59:13.713
MARISHA: Yasha's one, and then Jester's the
other.

02:59:13.713 --> 02:59:16.275
SAM: She's piloting-- do you know how to drive a
boat?

02:59:16.275 --> 02:59:17.992
ASHLEY: Well, we'll find out.

02:59:17.992 --> 02:59:19.276
SAM: (scared noise)

02:59:19.276 --> 02:59:20.474
ASHLEY: Yes, I do.

02:59:20.474 --> 02:59:23.827
SAM: Oh, okay. You're so needlessly scaring me for
no reason!

02:59:23.827 --> 02:59:27.867
MATT: So we have Fjord, Jester, Molly, and Beau in
one boat? And Yasha and Caleb and Nott in the

02:59:27.867 --> 02:59:29.448
other? Is that how it is?

02:59:29.448 --> 02:59:30.411
MARISHA: Sure.

02:59:30.411 --> 02:59:32.086
LIAM: And I send away Frumpkin.

02:59:32.086 --> 02:59:33.642
MATT: Okay.

02:59:33.642 --> 02:59:39.396
SAM: I'm going to place on my ring of water
walking that I stole from Jester.

02:59:39.396 --> 02:59:41.663
TRAVIS: Is this a boat with like, two oars?

02:59:41.663 --> 02:59:43.548
MATT: Two oars on each side, yeah.

02:59:44.118 --> 02:59:45.255
TRAVIS: All right.

02:59:45.255 --> 02:59:51.984
MATT: You guys all get in. It rocks a bit as you
all adjust your weight and find a place where the

02:59:52.134 --> 02:59:56.368
boat itself isn't listing too far to one side or
the other. The river current is pulling it along,

02:59:56.368 --> 03:00:01.856
so as soon as you step off, the last person
holding the rope, they immediately start following

03:00:01.856 --> 03:00:10.506
the current of the river, which is not rapid, but
it is moving at a fair speed. You all gather

03:00:10.506 --> 03:00:15.274
yourselves and follow it down, and as you
progress, you notice those green lanterns that are

03:00:15.274 --> 03:00:24.039
lit only seem to cover the vicinity of that dock
until, eventually, you are going into a pitch

03:00:24.039 --> 03:00:25.923
black cavern.

03:00:25.923 --> 03:00:27.273
LIAM: On our own?

03:00:27.273 --> 03:00:28.331
MATT: Hmm?

03:00:28.331 --> 03:00:29.631
LIAM: We are all on our own here right?

03:00:29.631 --> 03:00:30.859
MATT: You're all alone.

03:00:30.859 --> 03:00:31.722
TRAVIS: Caleb?

03:00:31.722 --> 03:00:32.533
LIAM: <i>Ja?</i>

03:00:32.533 --> 03:00:34.714
TRAVIS: You want to do your--? Read my mind.

03:00:34.714 --> 03:00:35.954
LIAM: (poof poof)

03:00:35.954 --> 03:00:37.433
MARISHA: I bring out and put on the goggles.

03:00:37.433 --> 03:00:41.579
LIAM: I let two of the globules hover around the
front of each boat. One at the front and one at

03:00:41.579 --> 03:00:43.297
the back of each boat.

03:00:43.297 --> 03:00:45.369
MATT: All right, so as the orbs--

03:00:45.369 --> 03:00:47.249
MARISHA: So romantic, you guys!

03:00:47.249 --> 03:00:49.543
LIAM and MATT: (singing) There you see her!

03:00:49.543 --> 03:00:51.936
MATT and MARISHA: (singing) There across the way!

03:00:51.936 --> 03:00:54.511
TRAVIS: (singing) Yah, yah, yah!

03:00:54.511 --> 03:00:58.967
LIAM: (singing) She's got a giant sword, but who
cares? You've got to ask her!

03:00:58.967 --> 03:01:01.764
MARISHA: (singing) Yah, yah, yah!

03:01:01.764 --> 03:01:09.412
TALIESIN: Hey, Beau. I pull out one of the holy
water flasks. Think you know what to do with this?

03:01:09.412 --> 03:01:11.561
MARISHA: I think I do!

03:01:11.561 --> 03:01:13.754
TALIESIN: Just in case.

03:01:13.754 --> 03:01:14.974
MARISHA: I put it away.

03:01:14.974 --> 03:01:16.975
TALIESIN: Who do you think the other one should go
to?

03:01:16.975 --> 03:01:24.782
MARISHA: Anyone who can beat face, but doesn't
have magic. Yasha, maybe? Nott?

03:01:24.782 --> 03:01:26.347
TALIESIN: Maybe Nott might be safer.

03:01:26.347 --> 03:01:27.758
SAM: What do I do with it?

03:01:27.758 --> 03:01:29.237
TALIESIN: You're not in a boat with us.

03:01:29.237 --> 03:01:31.774
SAM: (shouting) What do I do with it!?

03:01:31.774 --> 03:01:33.876
MARISHA: You dip your ammunition in it.

03:01:33.876 --> 03:01:35.362
TALIESIN: This one you throw?

03:01:35.362 --> 03:01:36.685
MATT: This one you throw.

03:01:36.685 --> 03:01:37.993
MARISHA: Oh, this one is a throwing one?

03:01:37.993 --> 03:01:39.478
MATT: This isn't an oil, this is water.

03:01:39.478 --> 03:01:41.079
MARISHA: Oh, never mind!

03:01:41.079 --> 03:01:42.646
TALIESIN: Know how to throw stuff?

03:01:42.646 --> 03:01:45.975
SAM: No, I've never thrown anything in my life.

03:01:45.975 --> 03:01:50.787
TALIESIN: If there was a basket for trash and you
threw it--

03:01:50.787 --> 03:01:55.719
SAM: As he's talking, I throw a gold coin at his
head.

03:01:55.719 --> 03:01:58.622
MATT: Okay, roll a d20 and add your dexterity
modifier.

03:01:58.622 --> 03:02:00.708
TALIESIN: Wow, that's exciting!

03:02:00.708 --> 03:02:03.239
SAM: That's a d20, I mean, that's a natural 20.

03:02:03.239 --> 03:02:05.156
TALIESIN: That doesn't count! That's cocked!

03:02:05.156 --> 03:02:07.481
LIAM: Sure it counts! It counts doubly as much!

03:02:07.481 --> 03:02:08.384
SAM: Do you want me to redo?

03:02:08.384 --> 03:02:09.404
LIAM: No!

03:02:09.404 --> 03:02:10.642
MATT: What are you doing?

03:02:10.642 --> 03:02:12.786
SAM: Redo. Way less!

03:02:12.786 --> 03:02:14.341
TALIESIN: Way less!

03:02:14.341 --> 03:02:15.513
SAM: Dexterity what?

03:02:15.513 --> 03:02:16.802
MATT: Add your dexterity modifier.

03:02:16.802 --> 03:02:18.333
SAM: Ten.

03:02:18.333 --> 03:02:24.331
MATT: It goes right past; you hear it (splash)
into the water below.

03:02:24.331 --> 03:02:26.818
TALIESIN: I'll take that. So when we get into the
boat together, I'm going to give you the other

03:02:26.818 --> 03:02:28.608
holy water flask.

03:02:28.608 --> 03:02:31.352
LIAM: (as Jester) "How big is the chamber we are
traveling in?"

03:02:31.368 --> 03:02:36.080
MATT: The chamber seems to shift at times.
Sometimes it squeezes in where it's just the river

03:02:36.080 --> 03:02:40.316
and the edges of the tunnel at about 15 feet from
side to side.

03:02:40.316 --> 03:02:43.730
LIAM: (as Jester) "With my darkvision, how high is
the ceiling in here?"

03:02:43.810 --> 03:02:51.802
MATT: The ceiling is roughly 15 feet as well. 15
to ten feet; sometimes it coasts down and becomes a

03:02:51.802 --> 03:02:55.633
bit lower. It is a natural river so--

03:02:55.721 --> 03:03:01.068
LIAM: (as Jester) "I grab the edge of the boat, and
I say: Oskar! Is there no echo?"

03:03:01.068 --> 03:03:04.063
MATT: (echoing) Oskar!

03:03:04.063 --> 03:03:06.177
LIAM: (as Jester) "That was pretty good!"

03:03:10.389 --> 03:03:16.104
MATT: As you guys head deeper into the
subterranean tunnels towards your destination,

03:03:17.913 --> 03:03:22.009
weapons at your side, prepared for whatever comes
in the near future--

03:03:22.009 --> 03:03:23.797
LIAM: God damn, he's going to end the game!

03:03:23.797 --> 03:03:24.961
ALL: No!

03:03:24.961 --> 03:03:27.384
MATT: We're going to go ahead and end tonight's
game.

03:03:27.384 --> 03:03:28.716
LIAM: Damn it!

03:03:28.716 --> 03:03:35.467
MATT: We don't have Laura here. We've had two
episodes that went four plus hours. My back's

03:03:35.467 --> 03:03:36.985
hurting a little.

03:03:36.985 --> 03:03:39.193
LIAM: Four more hours! Mimosas!

03:03:39.193 --> 03:03:41.765
TRAVIS: The people marathoning right now will be
grateful to hear that.

03:03:41.765 --> 03:03:43.310
LIAM: Come on!

03:03:43.310 --> 03:03:45.013
TALIESIN: And you have a holy water now.

03:03:45.013 --> 03:03:48.725
LIAM: It's like playing a video game for 30
minutes. It's so unsatisfying!

03:03:48.725 --> 03:03:50.896
MATT: We've been here for three hours!

03:03:50.896 --> 03:03:53.659
TRAVIS: I know it's coming. I know stuff is
coming.

03:03:53.659 --> 03:03:57.310
MATT: So yeah, before we get too deep into this,
we'll go ahead and pick up next week when Laura

03:03:57.310 --> 03:03:58.804
can join us.

03:03:58.804 --> 03:04:02.516
MARISHA: Feel better, Laura!

03:04:02.516 --> 03:04:05.263
TALIESIN: Please feel better.

03:04:05.263 --> 03:04:12.382
MATT: We'll pick up from there. Once again guys,
thank you so much for tuning in. Check out the

03:04:12.382 --> 03:04:19.697
awesomeness of 826LA and the stuff we are doing
with them. Check out Pillars of Eternity 2 and the

03:04:19.697 --> 03:04:25.440
really cool stuff that we are doing with them! And
yeah, we'll be back into this next week. Until

03:04:25.440 --> 03:04:29.004
then guys, have a wonderful week, we love you, and
is it Thursday yet?

03:04:29.083 --> 03:04:30.801
TRAVIS: No! <i>Nein!</i>

03:04:30.801 --> 03:16:31.456

1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.280
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome

2
00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:02.800
to tonight's episode of Critical Role,

3
00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.180
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

4
00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.973
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

5
00:00:05.973 --> 00:00:09.300
TRAVIS: (hollering) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

6
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.660
MATT: Like that.

7
00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.990
Before we jump into tonight's game,

8
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.580
we're going to go ahead and have some announcements,

9
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.830
beginning with our fantastic two sponsors tonight.

10
00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.260
Up first, a new sponsor.

11
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.330
You may have seen them talk

12
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:23.860
about their upcoming game on social media

13
00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.732
but it is Big Ben Entertainment and Paranoia.

14
00:00:27.732 --> 00:00:30.390
SAM: Paranoia.

15
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.690
MATT: And do we have any?

16
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:32.850
SAM: Oh, sorry.

17
00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.160
MATT: That you?
SAM: Yeah, that's me.

18
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.890
MATT: Oh.
SAM: But shh, quiet, man.

19
00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.650
There could be recording devices in here, all right?

20
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.980
I've got super secret info,

21
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.610
but the government might be watching.

22
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.510
So I'm going to use protection.

23
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.760
Okay, keep this between us, but our sponsor tonight

24
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.970
is a new video game from Big Ben Interactive

25
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.130
called Paranoia: Happiness is Mandatory,

26
00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.690
inspired by classic CRPG games and the original Kult RPG.

27
00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.390
In the game, you create and lead a team

28
00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.630
of four troubleshooters who take commands

29
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.290
from an all-knowing paranoid AI called a Friend Computer

30
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.320
in a retro-futuristic world filled with deadly tech.

31
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.320
Now, I've been awake for 44 straight hours playing it,

32
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.170
studying it, hunting for hidden messages and secret subtext.

33
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.200
Maybe it's a lack of sleep or the medically dangerous

34
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.190
amounts of Rockstar Energy Drink I've consumed,

35
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.380
but I was able to verify dozens of conspiracy theories

36
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.110
in this interactive, addictive game.

37
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.550
Here's a list of a few.

38
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.058
(laughter)

39
00:01:34.058 --> 00:01:37.640
Would you be surprised to learn that Marilyn Monroe

40
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.020
is not only alive, but she's a vampire

41
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.660
and she wrote "Old Town Road" as

42
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.540
a mind-control experiment for the CIA?

43
00:01:46.645 --> 00:01:48.990
Have you heard that if you Naruto run backwards

44
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.980
while listening to "I Am the Walrus,"

45
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.800
the lyrics say, "Taylor Swift was on the grassy knoll?"

46
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.371
I learned that truth from Paranoia the game.

47
00:01:58.371 --> 00:02:01.980
And did you know that the K-pop band BTS

48
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.880
is made entirely out of wood?

49
00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.420
That Finland is actually in New Mexico?

50
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.130
That the Large Hadron Collider

51
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.540
is a Sizzler for the Illuminati?

52
00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.270
All facts, but remember, you didn't hear them here.

53
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.620
You didn't hear them in the game

54
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.250
Paranoia: Happiness is Mandatory.

55
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.870
We'll actually be play--
(foil rustling)

56
00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.570
This is making noise.

57
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.090
I thought it was someone tapping me.

58
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.290
Yeah, we'll actually be playing the game on this channel

59
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.860
closer to the release date, but do not tell the Man.

60
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.380
Okay, check out the game for yourself

61
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.670
and learn more at critrole.com/paranoia.

62
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.540
Thanks for supporting the show.

63
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.755
I've got to burn this iPad before the Men in Black show up.

64
00:02:42.755 --> 00:02:44.798
TRAVIS: The cigarette, the cigarette, the cigarette!

65
00:02:44.798 --> 00:02:47.068
LAURA: Ah!
TALIESIN: There it is.

66
00:02:47.068 --> 00:02:49.070
(shouting)

67
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.120
TALIESIN: Everywhere.

68
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.671
TRAVIS: So much spittle.

69
00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:53.880
LAURA: So much spittle.
TALIESIN: Ah, spittle!

70
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.750
LIAM: Rockstar Energy Drink, not actually
a sponsor of the show.

71
00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:57.583
MATT: No, no.

72
00:02:57.583 --> 00:02:58.770
LAURA: No, but are very good.

73
00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:59.970
MARISHA: Neither is Sizzler.

74
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.510
MATT: Thank you, Sam.

75
00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.260
MATT: Thank you, big Ben,

76
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.197
and Paranoia, which I'm actually really--

77
00:03:08.197 --> 00:03:09.670
I'm excited to play.
TALIESIN: Fine game.

78
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.840
MATT: I've loved the RPG since I was very young

79
00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.930
and I'm excited for this game.

80
00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.770
TRAVIS: When his lips turn that purple, I get worried.

81
00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.640
MATT: Yeah, it's scary-looking.
LAURA: He really wasn't breathing.

82
00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.690
MARISHA: He was foaming at the mouth a little.

83
00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.450
LIAM: That was some method acting.
MATT: Yeah, well done.

84
00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.890
Also, we have our second returning sponsor

85
00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.980
since the beginning of the campaign, D&amp;D Beyond.

86
00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.320
D&amp;D Beyond, thank you so much

87
00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.490
for your continued support of the show.

88
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.230
And for those who haven't had a chance to check it out

89
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.840
and this is your first time hearing about it,

90
00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.500
go check it out at dndbeyond.com

91
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.500
or at specifically dndbeyond.link/criticalrole.

92
00:03:44.966 --> 00:03:46.041
But yeah, awesome tool.

93
00:03:46.041 --> 00:03:47.190
Check it out if you haven't checked it out yet.

94
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.290
LIAM: That's a lucid, rational representation of D&amp;D Beyond.

95
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.930
MATT: Well, comparatively.

96
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.380
It's still pretty slippery.

97
00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.290
Marisha, you have some things to mention.

98
00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.965
MARISHA: Oh, yeah, oh, golly gee.

99
00:03:57.965 --> 00:04:00.260
MATT: Oh, hello.
MARISHA: Oh, hello.

100
00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.330
In case you missed it,

101
00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.940
yesterday we shared our big old

102
00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.094
giant honking fall programming schedule.

103
00:04:08.094 --> 00:04:08.940
(cheering)

104
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.050
It's a fatty.

105
00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.160
It's a big one.

106
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.750
Yeah, highlights, of course.

107
00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.340
UnDeadwood.
TRAVIS: Oh, man.

108
00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.700
MARISHA: Four-part miniseries featuring

109
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.830
Brian Foster as The Marshal.

110
00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:25.436
And then of course, Pub Draw is returning.

111
00:04:25.436 --> 00:04:27.370
You can watch us all fail at drawing again.

112
00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.780
TRAVIS: Actually, some of us are pretty good.

113
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.820
MARISHA: Yeah, it's not too bad.

114
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.820
Also, a show that is turning out phenomenally well in post

115
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.790
the more edits that I get back of it, Mini Primetime.

116
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.490
with Will Friedle.

117
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.940
He is a treasure

118
00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.790
and I'm so glad we have the key to unlock him.

119
00:04:48.267 --> 00:04:51.620
And a ton of Everything is Content stuff, like a lot.

120
00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.380
Like a lot of stuff, so really,

121
00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.640
if you want to know all the full details,

122
00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.940
go to critrole.com.

123
00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.720
TRAVIS: Crit Role.
MARISHA: Crit Role.

124
00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.270
To check out all the good things we have coming out.

125
00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:03.997
MATT: Yeah, you guys have been busy.

126
00:05:03.997 --> 00:05:04.830
Y'all been real busy.

127
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.010
LAURA: It's a long time since we've done Crit Role.

128
00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.970
MARISHA: Crit Role.

129
00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.230
LAURA and LIAM: Crit Role.

130
00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.480
MATT: Back in the day.

131
00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.660
Sam?

132
00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.870
SAM: Yes, so Laura and Travis

133
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.920
are off to New York Comic Con next week

134
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.650
and we're hosting a very special one-shot

135
00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.601
on October 3rd at 7:00 pm Pacific.

136
00:05:22.601 --> 00:05:25.490
GMed by me, Sam Riegel.

137
00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.610
Tonight, we're excited to share to you guys

138
00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.450
that our sponsor for this one-shot

139
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.632
is the one and only Wendy's.

140
00:05:33.632 --> 00:05:35.882
(laughter)

141
00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:42.058
And I can guarantee that it will be ridiculous.

142
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.730
We'll be sharing more about this

143
00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.700
sponsored one-shot next Thursday,

144
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.720
so keep an eye out for more details.

145
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.490
Huge thanks to our friends at Wendy's for their support.

146
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.620
I can honestly say I've had two more Frosties this week

147
00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.080
than I have in the last 25 years

148
00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.797
and they're fucking great.

149
00:05:59.797 --> 00:06:02.750
(laughter)

150
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.320
LAURA: I can honestly say I'm actually really bummed

151
00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.680
that we're going to be in New York and missing it.

152
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.860
MARISHA: It's going to be ridiculous fun.

153
00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.100
LIAM: Shaping up.

154
00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.610
MARISHA: It's going to be good.

155
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.670
TRAVIS: You don't want to miss that.

156
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:14.960
MATT: And referring to New York Comic Con,

157
00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.940
our very own Brian W. Foster will be moderating a panel

158
00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.990
called Roleplaying a Human

159
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.530
with some familiar names and faces such as Mica Burton,

160
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:28.030
Clint McElroy, Rachel Miner, Brian Posehn, Joe Starr,

161
00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:32.420
and Dan Telfer on Thursday, October 3rd at 12:30pm

162
00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:35.620
in Room 1A21, so if you're going to
be at New York Comic Con,

163
00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:36.650
highly recommend you check it out.

164
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.810
A lot of good people on that panel.

165
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.200
The person moderating it's cool too, I guess.

166
00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.310
And have fun, should be fun.

167
00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:45.760
Laura, you have some updates as well?

168
00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.840
LAURA: Well, I do.

169
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.390
I don't know if you guys are aware,

170
00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:51.800
but we have some cool stuff in our store.

171
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.990
And as of today, we have,

172
00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:56.854
oh.
SAM: Oh.

173
00:06:56.854 --> 00:07:01.230
LAURA: It's an Is It Thursday Yet? wrap
for our fabulous tankards.

174
00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:02.420
MARISHA: Yes.

175
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.070
LAURA: We also have--
TRAVIS: I covered it.

176

LAURA: -- an I Have Passed Through Fire.

177
00:07:07.497 --> 00:07:09.850
A tribute to the lovely Keyleth.

LAURA: For "Yee-Haw Game Ranch."

186
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:28.777
MARISHA: Well, hell.

187
00:07:28.777 --> 00:07:31.770
LAURA: If you'll cut to that, you can see it,

188
00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:34.280
all you lovely folks at home.

189
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.590
It feels so, actually it's ridiculously beautiful.

190
00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:38.590
TRAVIS: Matt, don't let your hand

191
00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:40.100
fall into the void of the Gameverse.

192
00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.460
LAURA: Oh no!

193
00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:42.550
SAM: So you can use that?

194
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:45.580
LAURA: So you can follow along the adventures at home.

195
00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.127
I'm not sure.

196
00:07:49.149 --> 00:07:49.982
I don't know.
SAM: No,

197
00:07:49.982 --> 00:07:52.840
you can use that thing as a game pad, as a mouse pad.

198
00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.090
LAURA: Yes, oh yeah, you totally could.

199
00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:55.280
SAM: And your cat could take naps on it.

200
00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.450
LAURA: You can roll your dice on it.

201
00:07:56.450 --> 00:08:00.862
That was by, that was designed by @caeora.

202
00:08:00.862 --> 00:08:03.010
And then our beautiful wraps.

203
00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:06.890
The calligrapher on that is Chris Gladis and he's amazing.

204
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:08.630
He's done some other stuff for us as well.

205
00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:10.910
Also, it's not on the sheet

206
00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:14.940
but we have some awesome David Mack portraits

207
00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:16.520
that are in the store that went on sale

208
00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.290
I think when we weren't playing

209
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:19.700
and so if you didn't get the limited

210
00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.640
edition David Mack poster that we did,

211
00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.680
we wanted to make some of the portraits available

212
00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:26.900
and they're so fucking beautiful.

213
00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.520
So yeah, check them out.

214
00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.630
TRAVIS: And if you all just want to get Grog, it's okay.

215
00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:33.670
You don't have to get everybody else.

216
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:35.590
SAM: Crit Role!
MATT: There you are.

217
00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:37.020
All right.

218
00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:40.060
Well, that being said, I think it's time for us to go ahead

219
00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:44.625

(laughter)

252
00:10:29.611 --> 00:10:31.340
LIAM: Did you tell Laura, did you tell her?

253
00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:32.480
MATT: Every now and then, you get a glimpse

254
00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:35.480
of what I have to deal with every Thursday.

255
00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.313
TRAVIS: Just a glimpse.

256
00:10:36.313 --> 00:10:39.510
MATT: Just a glimpse, just a little peek
beneath the curtain.

257
00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:41.018
LIAM: Anal sprinkles.

258
00:10:43.162 --> 00:10:45.125
SAM and LAURA: (trumpeting)

259
00:10:45.125 --> 00:10:47.890
MATT: Sounds like a terrible culinary treat.

260
00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:49.290
TALIESIN: Worst DVD extra ever.

261
00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:50.450
MATT: Anyway.

262
00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:51.790
SAM: 32 flavors.

263
00:10:54.036 --> 00:10:55.111
MATT: (aggressive throat clearing)

264
00:10:55.111 --> 00:10:56.415
LAURA: Sorry.

265
00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.155
MATT: So last time,

266
00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:03.570
the Mighty Nein have been traversing

267
00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:05.850
their way across the lands of Xhorhas,

268
00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:09.350
returning to the actual Empire where it all began

269
00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:14.260
in search of information regarding where this beacon

270
00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.360
is currently being held that the Empire still holds

271
00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.380
and seeking information about this Obann figure,

272
00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:25.380
who has both taken your friend Yasha as a, seemingly

273
00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:28.865
as a companion for the time being alongside this journey

274
00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:33.880
as well as awakening, with your aid unintentionally,

275
00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.950
a terrible entity, a champion of Torog

276
00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:39.740
known as the Laughing Hand.

277
00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:43.340
Upon keeping your eyes on them magically from a distance,

278
00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:46.020
you've been able to follow some of their exploits

279
00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:47.800
while researching information about them

280
00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:51.180
and some elements of what they might be trying to do.

281
00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:53.220
With this newfound information,

282
00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:55.650
and discovering that they had attacked

283
00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:59.320
the Archive of the Cobalt Soul in Zadash

284
00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:02.510
and gathering this information, you decided to follow them

285
00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:07.248
towards the Lotusden Greenwood on the south of Xhorhas.

286
00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:12.140
You made an additional deal for rapid transportation

287
00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:16.230
with your sponsor, Shadowhand Essek Thelyss

288
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:20.127
who agreed begrudgingly for the very last time to do this.

289
00:12:21.165 --> 00:12:23.840
LIAM: The last, last time.
MARISHA: He keeps saying that.

290
00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:26.230
TRAVIS: You can't say no.
MATT: He's just racking up

291
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:28.010
the debt points with you guys.

292
00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:29.905
He's going to make you do some fun stuff down the road.

293
00:12:29.905 --> 00:12:31.570
TRAVIS: Shut up.

294
00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:34.790
MATT: There, nestled within the darkened shadow

295
00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:37.250
of a city street in Zadash,

296
00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:39.400
you use the transportation circle to send yourself

297
00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:43.930
to Rosohna, the city once known as Ghor Dranas.

298
00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:44.840
You flicking off some of

299
00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.560
the local townsguard before rushing off.

300
00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:47.710
SAM: Eat it, copper!

301
00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:51.990
MATT: We returned with you all appearing

302
00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:54.420
beneath the Lucid Bastion, the familiar space

303
00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:58.362
beneath the main central palace of the Kryn Dynasty.

304
00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:04.310
You arrive, are recognized and no issue seems to come

305
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:08.440
of the guards who are now getting fairly

306
00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.800
comfortable with your perpetual in and out.

307
00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.980
LAURA: Yes, but there are horses this time.

308
00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:13.860
MATT: That's true.

309
00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:15.300
SAM: Oh, boy.
MATT: You did have horses

310
00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:17.920
and you did jump multiple times

311
00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:21.930
through a bunch of other archives of the Cobalt Soul

312
00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:23.510
without approval or fair warning

313
00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:26.670
and acquired knowledge of a number

314
00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:28.170
of their teleportation sigils,

315
00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:30.020
which should be useful down the road.

316
00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:33.798
Though also being, for the time being,

317
00:13:33.798 --> 00:13:36.680
banned in most of them.

318
00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.988
But as you arrive in Rosohna--

319
00:13:38.988 --> 00:13:40.420
(clopping)

320
00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:43.070
emerging from the teleportation sigil,

321
00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:45.793
the day is yours.

322
00:13:45.793 --> 00:13:47.720
What would you like to do, Mighty Nein?

323
00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:49.670
SAM: Essek?

324
00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:51.090
LAURA: Yeah, we need to just ride.

325
00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:53.050
I mean, just go as fast as we can.

326
00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:54.510
TRAVIS: Yeah.

327
00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:56.051
MARISHA: To Essek!
SAM: Hyah!

328
00:13:56.051 --> 00:13:58.450
(laughter)

329
00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:01.150
MATT: You guys start like trotting through the halls.

330
00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:05.070
The halls are pretty prone to echoing anyway,

331
00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:06.790
but as you make your way out

332
00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:10.260
of the subterranean teleportation chamber,

333
00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.520
through the halls of the Lucid Bastion,

334
00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.540
you draw attention from everywhere.

335
00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:17.650
LAURA: Are there any horses in the city?

336
00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:19.648
MATT: There are horses, yeah.

337
00:14:19.648 --> 00:14:22.690
Not as often as, let's say,

338
00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:23.923
heavy trade cities.

339
00:14:23.923 --> 00:14:26.127
A lot of the horses are either done for--

340
00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:30.690
are brought on trade paths between Rosohna and other cities

341
00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:33.180
or are front line as part of the military,

342
00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:36.720
though it's not as big of a horse nation as the Empire is.

343
00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.310
Anyway, you are drawing attention

344
00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:42.170
both from the inside of the Bastion and onto the streets

345
00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:47.170
as a group of already sore thumb-looking figures

346
00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:50.200
come barreling through the center of the ever-midnight

347
00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:53.900
town of Rosohna, heads turning, heading towards

348
00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:57.738
the ever-present beacon of your giant, glowing roof tree,

349
00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:00.965
heading through the Firmaments.

350
00:15:00.965 --> 00:15:01.940
TALIESIN: No regrets.

351
00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:04.110
MATT: You approach and as you ride,

352
00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:09.100
awaiting outside you see, arms probably crossed,

353
00:15:10.177 --> 00:15:13.790
from the slight shape of the front of the cloak and mantle,

354
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:18.080
you see Essek just there staring at the ground

355
00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:21.720
and then up at you as you all approach.

356
00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.950
As you (clopping)

357
00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:26.110
make your way over towards him.

358
00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:28.285
TRAVIS: A little too good.
MATT: He looks over.

359
00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:31.410
"Hello."

360
00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:33.430
LAURA: Super sorry about this again.

361
00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:36.970
LIAM: As you can see, we have come
a very long way on horseback.

362
00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:38.703
LAURA: Yes.
LIAM: We've just arrived.

363
00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:42.420
MATT: "Impressive, I suppose?"

364
00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:44.620
LIAM: We are in a bit of a hurry.

365
00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:48.340
And I know that we are wearing out our welcome, but

366
00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:51.630
we need to get to the Lotusden.

367
00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:54.750
LAURA: The Laughing Hand is about, and you know the people

368
00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:56.810
that we talked about who we accidentally,

369
00:15:56.810 --> 00:16:00.300
that got loose up-- I don't remember where,

370
00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:02.490
but it was I think in the north somewhere--

371
00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:04.820
and then they have figured out how

372
00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:07.960
to open up somebody else's casket stuff

373
00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:09.460
and then they're going to awaken

374
00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:11.220
somebody else and it's going to be even worse

375
00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:12.840
because there's already three of them.

376
00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.572
And if there's four, then they're going to be

377
00:16:14.572 --> 00:16:17.743
so much more powerful and now he's got a skull

378
00:16:17.743 --> 00:16:19.940
and he's going to find a heart.

379
00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:22.510
We have to beat him.

380
00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:24.120
MATT: "Of course."
SAM: The heart of a very, very,

381
00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:27.253
very bad creature that they want to awaken.

382
00:16:29.838 --> 00:16:32.770
It's closer to the Dynasty than the Empire.

383
00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:35.120
This could directly impact your people.

384
00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.580
MARISHA: Yeah, it's a demon assassin.

385
00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:38.620
LAURA: Super bad.
MARISHA: Heart of a demon assassin.

386
00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:42.050
LAURA: It's the group of people who are
letting all the bad things out, you know?

387
00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:44.323
MARISHA: Skull of a demon assassin.

388
00:16:44.323 --> 00:16:46.010
TRAVIS: He seems to be part of their cult.

389
00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:47.780
They're called the Angel of Irons.

390
00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:49.430
LAURA: Which we already told you about, I think.

391
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:52.390
MATT: "Yes, you have informed me
of this and I have already agreed.

392
00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:55.330
"You are not needing to convince me any further."

393
00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:56.798
LAURA: Okay, I was just letting you know.

394
00:16:56.798 --> 00:16:59.180
It's super important, that's why we asked for help.

395
00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:01.613
MATT: "Do you have a place to put your horses?"

396
00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:05.862
SAM: Consider them a gift.

397
00:17:06.803 --> 00:17:10.715
TRAVIS: In exchange for your continued assistance.

398
00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:15.983
LIAM: Yeah, these are Empire horses,
a rarity in these parts.

399
00:17:15.983 --> 00:17:17.713
TRAVIS: They may know something.

400
00:17:18.796 --> 00:17:21.522
(chuckling)

401
00:17:21.522 --> 00:17:26.061
MATT: His rocky held exterior cracks a little

402
00:17:26.061 --> 00:17:28.810
with a smile and he goes,

403
00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:33.128
"Well, I do not consider this payment.

404
00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:39.080
"A favor for a favor and I'm certain I will

405
00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.780
"call these favors in at some time in the future.

406
00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:44.810
"But for now, just go ahead and hitch them

407
00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:47.727
"to the exterior of your home and we'll be on our way."

408
00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:51.750
TALIESIN: Seems like a plan.
LAURA: Yeah.

409
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:53.383
SAM: Great, let's do that.

410
00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:55.780
TRAVIS: Yep, we do so.

411
00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:57.480
MATT: You hitch them to the side there.

412
00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:00.740
You gather up around him.

413
00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:02.147
"So where to, then?"

414
00:18:02.147 --> 00:18:03.750
TRAVIS: Are we just doing this out in the street?

415
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:06.960
LAURA: Do you know where the Lotusden is?

416
00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.220
MATT: "I do, yes."

417
00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:09.053
LAURA: You do?!

418
00:18:09.053 --> 00:18:10.490
LIAM: Have you been there?

419
00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:11.810
MATT: "I've not been there, but I have

420
00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:15.420
"studied the vicinity of Xhorhas."

421
00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:16.980
LAURA: How big is it?

422
00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:21.330
MATT: "Oh, it's fairly large."

423
00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:23.590
SAM: You saw it, right?

424
00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:25.950
LAURA: I mean, I saw where they were.

425
00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:29.200
SAM: Maybe you could show an image?

426
00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.020
Maybe that would narrow down some

427
00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:34.210
of the geography of where we're headed.

428
00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:35.315
Maybe?
LAURA: I mean,

429
00:18:35.315 --> 00:18:37.990
I could try to draw what I saw.

430
00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:41.020
SAM: Oh, okay then, well maybe-- I don't know.

431
00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:44.496
MATT: Make a nature or survival check, your choice.

432
00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:49.913
LAURA: 19.

433
00:18:49.913 --> 00:18:51.940
MATT: 19, okay.

434
00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:54.300
Remembering back to the vision you had when they

435
00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:57.100
were traveling and thinking of the time of day that it

436
00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:00.363
would have been here and where the sun was in the sky,

437
00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:04.380
you can ascertain they were probably heading south.

438
00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:06.457
LAURA: Whoa, I'm so smart.

439
00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:10.247
I think they were headed south.
MATT: It was a good roll.

440
00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:13.675
LAURA: So we should probably go

441
00:19:13.675 --> 00:19:16.198
towards the south of the Lotusden, right?

442
00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:19.140
MATT: "Were they in the forest, or were they--?"

443
00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:21.590
LAURA: They were entering the forest, right?

444
00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:23.865
Or were they in the forest? I can't remember.

445
00:19:23.865 --> 00:19:25.189
MATT: They were entering and then--

446
00:19:25.189 --> 00:19:27.390
LAURA: They were-- I feel like it was swampy-ish

447
00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:29.420
where they were coming from and they were

448
00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:31.850
getting to more dense foliage or something.

449
00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:34.000
TRAVIS: Yeah, Essek, on this map, do you know if the area

450
00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.400
right above the Lotusden, represented here,

451
00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.930
is that swampland, this part?

452
00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:39.920
MATT: "That is largely marsh before

453
00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:42.180
"it goes into the Fevergulf, yes."

454
00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:44.073
TRAVIS: Should we try the middle

455
00:19:44.073 --> 00:19:47.160
or should we try the most southernmost point and work up?

456
00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:49.590
SAM: No, I think we should go where they were, the swamp.

457
00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:51.690
TRAVIS: Up here? They were making their way here?

458
00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:52.523
SAM: Yeah.

459
00:19:52.523 --> 00:19:54.550
LAURA: I think we should be south of them.

460
00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:55.690
MARISHA: Well, they were looking--

461
00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:58.270
MATT: "If they're traveling southward towards the Den--"

462
00:19:58.270 --> 00:19:59.103
LAURA: Yeah.

463
00:19:59.103 --> 00:20:00.350
MATT: "And through a swamp area, then

464
00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:02.400
"I think you're onto that northern side."

465
00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.320
LAURA: Okay.
SAM: Let's do that.

466
00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:04.910
LAURA: Yeah, let's do that.

467
00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:07.600
MARISHA: Do we want to take a pee break real quick

468
00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.130
while we're here at the Xhorhaus,

469
00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:10.620
check in on the plants, you know?

470
00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:14.080
Make sure that no one's broken in, any disturbances.

471
00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:14.913
SAM: I'm fine.

472
00:20:14.913 --> 00:20:16.710
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, I feel like there's a bit of urgency here.

473
00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:18.110
MATT: "All right, gather around."

474
00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:19.760
MARISHA: Are we at the Xhorhaus?

475
00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.460
Or where are we?
LAURA: Yeah, but it's super fast.

476
00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:24.475
We have to be, like we have to beat them.

477
00:20:24.475 --> 00:20:25.750
MARISHA: Dairon is here.

478
00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:27.490
TRAVIS: Are you going to pee your pants?

479
00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:29.007
LAURA: We have to beat them to the place.

480
00:20:29.007 --> 00:20:30.950
SAM: I will cast Message and point inside

481
00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:34.207
the house and say: Dairon, are you in there?

482
00:20:35.534 --> 00:20:36.650
MATT: No response.

483
00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:37.650
SAM: She's not home.

484
00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:38.783
MARISHA: Let's go.

485
00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:42.708
MATT: All right.
TRAVIS: We're ready.

486
00:20:42.708 --> 00:20:44.520
MATT: His hands emerge from under the cloak.

487
00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:48.650
You guys gather in a circle, a familiar joining of hands.

488
00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:52.050
He focuses, and I need someone to roll a d100 for me.

489
00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:54.480
LIAM: I'll do it.
LAURA: Okay.

490
00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:55.950
SAM: ♪ The wizard. ♪

491
00:20:59.727 --> 00:21:00.930
LIAM: That was a 92.

492
00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:02.580
MATT: 92, all righty.

493
00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:04.170
LAURA: That's good, that's good.

494
00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:06.278
MATT: Yeah, so without issue,

495
00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:11.490
you all (swooshing) find the entirety

496
00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:14.660
of the scene of the city around you fade to darkness

497
00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:16.950
and you're all drawn in that same instantaneous

498
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:19.650
forceful gravitational sucking sensation

499
00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:21.841
from the center of your torso, like

500
00:21:21.841 --> 00:21:23.940
your sternum is trying to burrow its way out of your chest.

501
00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:26.110
Not out of pain, but just a forceful tug

502
00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:27.960
and as you are dragged along with it,

503
00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:28.970
but a moment later,

504
00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:31.540
your feet find purchase once more on hard ground,

505
00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:33.720
but not as hard as you began this journey.

506
00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.930
Your feet (squelching)

507
00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:38.225
into a marsh about a foot--

508
00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:42.520
I'm sorry, about an inch or two into the mud,

509
00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:44.780
your feet descend and suck in.

510
00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:46.450
The water seeps in a bit through any

511
00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:48.938
of the cracks of your lower part of your boots,

512
00:21:48.938 --> 00:21:50.647
immediately soggy in the base.

513
00:21:50.647 --> 00:21:52.578
LAURA: I'm glad I'm wearing my
old boots and not my new boots.

514
00:21:52.578 --> 00:21:55.860
TRAVIS: Would this be considered difficult terrain?

515
00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:59.150
MATT: Not this deep,

516
00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:01.870
but were it to turn into a deeper swamp, possibly.

517
00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:03.813
TRAVIS: Yeah, all right.

518
00:22:03.813 --> 00:22:05.273
MATT: All right.

519
00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:08.000
TRAVIS: About what time of day is it here?

520
00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.403
LIAM: It is-- what time of day is it?

521
00:22:12.112 --> 00:22:13.780
TRAVIS: What time of day is it?

522
00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:14.820
MATT: I'd say it's

523
00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:17.240
like early afternoon, I'd say.

524
00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:19.180
Because you traveled--

525
00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:20.800
because it was--

526
00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:22.200
let's see, you got to the--

527
00:22:23.244 --> 00:22:24.719
LIAM: It's wherever you peg it.

528
00:22:24.719 --> 00:22:26.077
Caleb would know, he knows the hour

529
00:22:26.077 --> 00:22:27.218
and he knows where north is.
MATT: No, I'm trying to think.

530
00:22:27.218 --> 00:22:28.750
You journeyed to Zadash.

531
00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:32.260
You arrived, pretty much bee-lined to the Archive,

532
00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:34.670
researched for hours, so it'd be like mid-afternoon.

533
00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:36.060
LIAM: Okay.

534
00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:37.680
Three, three-ish.

535
00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:39.070
MATT: Four or five.
LIAM: Fish-ish?

536
00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:40.860
MATT: Pushing towards dusk.
LIAM: Three, four, five.

537
00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:42.150
MATT: In the next few hours.

538
00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:44.140
LIAM: It's 4:38.

539
00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:45.473
TRAVIS: That's very specific.

540
00:22:45.473 --> 00:22:48.900
SAM: Do we have any way by magical means or otherwise

541
00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:53.900
of tracking or tracing where our former friend, now enemy,

542
00:22:54.590 --> 00:22:57.460
murderous assassin Yasha might be?

543
00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:58.840
Is there a locate spell?

544
00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:01.230
LAURA: I have a Locate Object spell.

545
00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:02.860
SAM: You know her weapon.

546
00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:04.500
MARISHA: Her sword, yeah.

547
00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:07.990
LAURA: Yeah, I could cast that, it's a concentration

548
00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:10.700
and if she's within 1,000 feet of us, I will know.

549
00:23:11.595 --> 00:23:13.650
TALIESIN: Could you do it for the heart possibly, or no?

550
00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:15.990
LAURA: I don't know enough about it.

551
00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:17.490
I just know it's a heart.

552
00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:19.160
But I guess I would know it's a heart

553
00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:20.950
not inside a body potentially,

554
00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:22.530
but it could be inside a body.

555
00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:24.900
TRAVIS: But Jester, if that actually is a heart

556
00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:26.860
and not something that's represented as a heart.

557
00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:29.900
LAURA: That's true, it could be a giant jewel or something.

558
00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:31.910
Like the heart of the--

559
00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:33.630
SAM: The sea?

560
00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:35.780
LAURA: The Ruby of the Sea.
SAM: Oh, yes.

561
00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:38.200
LIAM: You are thinking about the other campaign.

562
00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.870
TALIESIN: I imagine the hope is to
get the heart before they do

563
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:42.340
so that they can't get their friend together.

564
00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:44.900
LAURA: That's the goal.
TALIESIN: Not necessarily to find <i>them</i>.

565
00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:46.590
LAURA: Right.

566
00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:47.750
TALIESIN: Yet.

567
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:49.816
LAURA: So what should I do?

568
00:23:49.816 --> 00:23:52.930
SAM: You should find the thing that we know, her sword.

569
00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:55.690
LAURA: And just hope that we stay clear of her?

570
00:23:55.690 --> 00:23:57.890
TRAVIS: Hope it doesn't trigger at all.

571
00:23:59.832 --> 00:24:01.100
LAURA: Okay.

572
00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:03.210
SAM: I don't think she's within 1,000 feet of us anyway.

573
00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:04.920
I'm looking around.

574
00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:06.580
LAURA: 1,000 feet is pretty far.

575
00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:08.280
MATT: As you look around, the one thing you do notice

576
00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.700
is emerging from the nearby marsh

577
00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:13.810
and it is like, you know, various degrees

578
00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:15.800
of some hillsides that protrude

579
00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:19.630
from the somewhat damp, swampy marsh floor.

580
00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:23.250
The sound of buzzing insects surrounds the vicinity.

581
00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:24.810
Later in the day, that hot,

582
00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:26.483
orangey light is coming

583
00:24:26.483 --> 00:24:29.550
through the broken, clouded sky.

584
00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:31.540
It's not hot,

585
00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:33.910
but it is humid

586
00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:36.040
and just a little muggy and uncomfortable.

587
00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:37.640
You do notice someone at the nearby rocks.

588
00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:39.920
While you were conversing, Essek has made his way over there

589
00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:42.380
and is drawing his Teleportation Circle on the rock

590
00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:44.800
and he's just not even caring
to listen to what you guys are doing.

591
00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:47.140
LIAM: Can I get a bead on his mood

592
00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:50.350
or his attitude towards us since we met up with him?

593
00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:51.950
MATT: Make an insight check.

594
00:24:52.859 --> 00:24:55.069
LIAM: How do I do this again?

595
00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.540
That is a 26.

596
00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:01.800
MATT: Damn good insight.

597
00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:03.230
MARISHA: Ooh, whispers!

598
00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:07.050
LIAM: This might be my first whisper of the campaign.

599
00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:10.180
SAM: Guys, whispers aren't sponsored by anything,

600
00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:13.220
but you guys should go to the Crit Role store

601
00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:17.280
and buy our merch and also, what was my sponsor today?

602
00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:21.290
Paranoia: Happiness is Magic-- Happiness is Mandatory.

603
00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:23.680
You should buy that game when it comes out

604
00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:26.010
and keep a look at the channel

605
00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:30.090
because we might play it soon, I don't know.

606
00:25:31.165 --> 00:25:32.648
MATT: All righty.

607
00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:38.240
MATT: Every time you lift that monstrous metal beast.

608
00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:40.310
TRAVIS: Just as a baseline--
LIAM: That's Laura Bailey.

609
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:43.320
TRAVIS: Aside from the buzzing insects, are there--

610
00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:45.580
is there bird, animal noises?

611
00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:48.420
Does the forest sound like it moves

612
00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:50.917
quite a bit or is it actually quite still?

613
00:25:50.917 --> 00:25:52.430
MATT: Well, the area that you're in right now,

614
00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:54.650
there occasionally sparse trees

615
00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:58.390
maybe a few dozen yards apart each.

616
00:25:58.390 --> 00:25:59.950
The treeline of the Lotusden is a little

617
00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:02.240
further south from you, maybe about a 10 minute walk.

618
00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:05.290
You can see where the actual Lotusden Greenwood begins

619
00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:08.120
and it is a dense forest.

620
00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:10.970
LAURA: So we bamfed behind the group,

621
00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:13.090
or we tried to bamf-- we were trying

622
00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:14.770
to bamf ahead of the group, right?

623
00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:16.550
TRAVIS: Yeah, middle of the Lotusden, right?

624
00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:18.433
LAURA: Yeah...

625
00:26:18.433 --> 00:26:22.060
or did we bamf behind where they had already gone?

626
00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:24.620
MATT: He was told you wanted to bamf

627
00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:27.790
onto the northern side of the forest.

628
00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:28.623
TALIESIN: Okay.

629
00:26:28.623 --> 00:26:29.920
LAURA: Okay, so we bamfed behind them.

630
00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.820
SAM: Yeah. So we can track them.
MARISHA: Are there any trees?

631
00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:34.990
Or is it like a swamp with vines?

632
00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:36.620
Can I pull some Tarzan shit?

633
00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:39.340
Can I climb to something for a better vantage point?

634
00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:41.060
MATT: You can go to one of the lower trees. The higher

635
00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:43.470
trees are in the actual Lotusden, but it's a quick jump

636
00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:45.780
to go in there if you wanted to. It's up to you.

637
00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:49.430
MARISHA: No, let's just go in, right?

638
00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:50.263
SAM: Yes.

639
00:26:50.263 --> 00:26:52.680
LAURA: Can we see any footprints anywhere?

640
00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.570
I'm going to cast Locate Object on Yasha's sword.

641
00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:56.360
TRAVIS: Just so we're all on the same page.

642
00:26:57.210 --> 00:26:59.730
They started at the top of the Greenwood

643
00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:01.670
and we bamfed to the same area.

644
00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:02.790
Not in the middle, right?

645
00:27:02.790 --> 00:27:04.150
LAURA: I thought we were bamfing to the middle.

646
00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:05.310
TRAVIS: We were going to get more ahead of them?

647
00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:08.420
LAURA: Yeah, I thought that's what we were doing, but if--

648
00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:10.733
TRAVIS: Because they're moving south
and we were trying to cut them off

649
00:27:10.733 --> 00:27:13.256
so we can get to--
MARISHA: The south side, right?

650
00:27:13.256 --> 00:27:16.343
LIAM: That's what I thought the plan
was too, was to be ahead of them.

651
00:27:16.343 --> 00:27:18.070
LIAM: Trying to.
MARISHA: To intercept.

652
00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:19.680
LIAM: These are invisible things that we don't understand.

653
00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:21.660
LAURA: We had said the south side.
MARISHA: Is that what we did?

654
00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:23.210
LAURA: But we bamfed to the north side.

655
00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:26.280
MATT: The person who's responsible for teleporting you

656
00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:28.300
followed the instructions he was given,

657
00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:30.700
which was teleport you to the north side of the forest.

658
00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:32.050
LIAM: Then it's done.
SAM: That's fine.

659
00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:33.617
We'll track them, it's fine.

660
00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:36.670
MATT: If you wanted to go somewhere more specific,

661
00:27:36.670 --> 00:27:37.990
you should've pointed it out to him.

662
00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:39.998
LIAM: It's all right, misunderstandings happen

663
00:27:39.998 --> 00:27:42.710
between drow elves and tieflings and humans,

664
00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:43.930
so that's what happened.

665
00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:46.690
MARISHA: Oh yeah, maybe it's like a colloquialism.

666
00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:47.765
LAURA: Yeah, maybe.

667
00:27:47.765 --> 00:27:49.443
SAM: We can do some tracking.
MARISHA: Maybe north side.

668
00:27:49.443 --> 00:27:51.010
SAM: Caduceus, you're a good tracker, right?

669
00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:51.843
TALIESIN: A what?

670
00:27:51.843 --> 00:27:53.700
LAURA: I have a pretty decent survival.

671
00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:55.240
LIAM: Well, aside from that--
LAURA: And that's tracking.

672
00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:58.040
LIAM: Caduceus, are you getting any sort of feeling from--

673
00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:01.340
MATT: He hasn't-- Essek hasn't left yet, if you want

674
00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:04.920
to file a complaint or ask for something else to help.

675
00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:08.460
Like, he's about to jump through a Teleportation Circle.

676
00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:10.080
MARISHA: That feels rude, right?

677
00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:12.980
I'm the rude one and I feel like that feels rude.

678
00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:14.430
TRAVIS: What, to ask him to do it again?

679
00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:15.263
MARISHA: Yeah.

680
00:28:15.263 --> 00:28:16.250
TRAVIS: I would ask him to do it again.

681
00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:18.750
I wanted to be in the middle.

682
00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:20.370
MARISHA: Hey, Essek!

683
00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:22.000
MATT: He's like--

684
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.260
MARISHA: You got any more of those?

685
00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:25.360
Like, how many times can you do that?

686
00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:28.020
TRAVIS: I'm so sorry.
I feel like we didn't communicate clearly.

687
00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:31.290
When we pointed to the middle of the forest,

688
00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:33.240
that's where we wanted to go.

689
00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:34.950
Not here, there.

690
00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:36.290
Could we do that?

691
00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:38.250
LIAM: We're the biggest assholes.

692
00:28:38.250 --> 00:28:39.600
MATT: He stands up straight

693
00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.690
from a slightly hunched position over the rock,

694
00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:45.110
finishing the final scribblings across its surface

695
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:48.530
before he turns, holding his iridescent blue chalk

696
00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:50.190
in his fingertips, he just spins and goes--

697
00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:52.730
LIAM: That stuff is expensive.
MARISHA: It's pretty.

698
00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:54.850
LAURA: Is it expensive?
LIAM: It's very pricey.

699
00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:57.424
LAURA: Do you think worth one horse
pricey or more than that?

700
00:28:57.424 --> 00:28:58.724
TRAVIS: This'll be fine.

701
00:28:58.724 --> 00:28:59.656
SAM: He's going to kill us.

702
00:28:59.656 --> 00:29:04.036
MARISHA: He's going to just flip us off
as he jumps into that circle.

703
00:29:04.036 --> 00:29:05.830
You want to grab it?

704
00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:07.305
TRAVIS: No, I said gravity.

705
00:29:07.305 --> 00:29:09.820
He's got gravity on his side.

706
00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:12.450
Or no, I mean, we're just fine where we are.

707
00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:17.210
LIAM: I think what my companions are trying to request,

708
00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:21.100
we weren't clear enough, which is foolish of us

709
00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:24.590
because the stakes are so high right now.

710
00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:26.230
But we actually wish to go--

711
00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:28.150
Fjord, point it out on the map.

712
00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:34.250
I walk forward to Essek and place

713
00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:38.230
my hand on his forearm and say, "It's on me.

714
00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:41.590
"I should have been a little more involved

715
00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:46.260
"in the planning of this moment, and I apologize very much."

716
00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:47.780
MATT: One of the two of you

717
00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:50.070
make a persuasion check with advantage

718
00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:51.380
or you can each make one separately.

719
00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:52.780
It's up to you because you are helping each other.

720
00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:54.000
LIAM: Fjord and me?
MATT: Yes,

721
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.770
since you are both the two that are trying to persuade him.

722
00:29:57.770 --> 00:30:00.320
LAURA: I'm going to just pat Caleb on the back of his arm.

723
00:30:01.939 --> 00:30:03.372
(whispers) Guidance.

724
00:30:04.731 --> 00:30:06.780
(even quieter) Guidance.
LIAM: People can see that.

725
00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:08.690
MATT: Yeah, it's not like, pat.

726
00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:11.780
It's saying a phrase and a gesture and doing it.

727
00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:14.316
LAURA: The Traveler loves you so much.

728
00:30:14.316 --> 00:30:16.710
(laughter)

729
00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:19.098
LIAM: Okay, so it's on me.

730
00:30:19.098 --> 00:30:20.680
I have advantage.

731
00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:21.720
Is that all right?

732
00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:22.970
TRAVIS: Is your persuasion as--
LIAM: Pretty good.

733
00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:24.350
It's not as good as Fjord's is.

734
00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:25.630
TRAVIS: Then we should both roll.
LIAM: But it's close.

735
00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:26.995
TRAVIS: Let's both roll.

736
00:30:26.995 --> 00:30:28.702
LIAM: What did you give me?
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

737
00:30:28.702 --> 00:30:30.619
LIAM: Ooh!
MARISHA: Ooh!

738
00:30:32.699 --> 00:30:34.340
MATT: For a total of--?

739
00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:36.370
LAURA: Plus four-- a d4.
TRAVIS: 26, 25.

740
00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:37.460
LIAM: Ooh, 22.

741
00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:39.770
LAURA: Well, a d4, you have to roll a d4.

742
00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:41.360
LIAM: It's going to be four.

743
00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:42.668
It was four.
SAM: It's four.

744
00:30:42.668 --> 00:30:43.800
(laughter)

745
00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:46.560
26 and a natural 20.

746
00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:47.510
LAURA: Amazing.

747
00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:48.980
TALIESIN: Why can't we always roll like this?

748
00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:50.722
MARISHA: I know.
LIAM: 20, 20.

749
00:30:52.017 --> 00:30:55.603
MATT: The chalk descends back beneath the cloak.

750
00:30:56.590 --> 00:31:00.412
He looks at the two of you, and looks
across at the rest of the group and goes,

751
00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:06.940
"Very well, though this is expending the limits of my

752
00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:12.055
"prominent abilities for the day.

753
00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:16.960
"Come, gather, are you going to do this or not?"

754
00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:18.126
(all agreeing)

755
00:31:18.126 --> 00:31:19.335
LAURA: Do you want to hang out with us

756
00:31:19.335 --> 00:31:22.210
until you can regain your spells and stuff?

757
00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:23.043
MARISHA: Yeah.

758
00:31:23.043 --> 00:31:24.470
LAURA: You can, I mean.

759
00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:28.070
MATT: "There would be nothing I would love more

760
00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:30.589
"than to not be around you all."

761
00:31:30.589 --> 00:31:31.680
(laughter)

762
00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:33.180
MATT: "For the remainder of this day.

763
00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:35.543
"So,

764
00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:38.660
"let's try this again, shall we?"

765
00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:39.493
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: "All right."

766
00:31:39.493 --> 00:31:42.040
LIAM: I give his forearm just a little squeeze,

767
00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:43.730
and let it go.

768
00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:44.940
LAURA: Okay, yeah.

769
00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:48.310
MATT: He like pulls away just like in a (low grunt).

770
00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:52.580
Go ahead and roll a d100 for me.

771
00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:53.425
LIAM: Oh, shit.

772
00:31:53.425 --> 00:31:54.625
LAURA: Oh, god!

773
00:31:54.625 --> 00:31:56.717
TRAVIS: Should someone else roll a d100?

774
00:31:56.717 --> 00:31:59.190
LAURA: No.
SAM: No, this is good.

775
00:31:59.190 --> 00:32:00.692
TALIESIN: We're fine.
LIAM: 91.

776
00:32:00.692 --> 00:32:01.870
(cheering)

777
00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:04.390
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: You hush your mouth.

778
00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:05.640
MATT: Some lucky rolls tonight.

779
00:32:06.650 --> 00:32:07.766
All right.

780
00:32:09.025 --> 00:32:10.733
MARISHA: I don't want to be in the middle.

781
00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:14.563
MATT: So

782
00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:17.730
the familiar sensation this time,

783
00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:20.810
as opposed to being pulled into a void

784
00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:22.690
and then pushed out the other side,

785
00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:27.150
this feels like reality static shifts.

786
00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:29.760
And you guys are suddenly shunted

787
00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:32.380
miles and miles to the south.

788
00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:33.830
As soon as you all stop,

789
00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:35.120
there's like a brief moment of momentum

790
00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:37.450
and your stomach spins and feels sick

791
00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:41.220
just momentarily as you all touch down onto even,

792
00:32:42.816 --> 00:32:43.870
I'd say spongier ground.

793
00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:47.660
It's still marshland in this part of the forest

794
00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:50.740
but as opposed to being just like a thick, watery swamp,

795
00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:54.950
it's just damp, undergrowth

796
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:59.542
and general dense, gross forest floor.

797
00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:02.005
Around you,

798
00:33:03.826 --> 00:33:05.260
you can hear the echoing calls

799
00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:09.020
of strange birds just permeating

800
00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:13.380
what is a very thick canopy of dangling vines,

801
00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:17.375
tangled branches and thick, thick, deep green leaves.

802
00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:23.220
You can see faint, low hints of mist that just slightly

803
00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:26.570
drift over large, heavy roots the protrude

804
00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:30.150
from underneath and twist and knot

805
00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:32.360
between each other as the different trees

806
00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:34.140
that push in the space around you.

807
00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:36.470
You realize as you land that a few of you may have

808
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:39.160
been a little close for comfort to something solid,

809
00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:42.060
but you safely manage to make your way here without issue.

810
00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:47.420
You occasionally hear a little bit of a strange monster.

811
00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:50.070
It's like (hooting) in the distance

812
00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:53.210
and other creatures (chittering).

813
00:33:54.063 --> 00:33:55.110
SAM: Predator shit.

814
00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:56.860
MATT: It's a very lively--
TRAVIS: I don't like it.

815
00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:58.300
MATT: Very lived in--

816
00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:01.933
LAURA: This is way creepier
than the other place we bamfed to.

817
00:34:03.690 --> 00:34:07.310
MATT: The air smells of fresh vegetation, a recent rainfall,

818
00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:10.520
occasionally waves of a putrid musk

819
00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:13.620
or sweet flower scent whiff through the air.

820
00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:15.833
It's a very

821
00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:20.130
lively, natural

822
00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:22.420
place where civilization seems to have

823
00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:24.420
not really got a foothold or if it has,

824
00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:27.670
it's been heavily reclaimed over time.

825
00:34:27.670 --> 00:34:32.130
As Essek looks around, "Well, now I have formally

826
00:34:32.130 --> 00:34:36.255
"visited the Lotusden, I would not wish to return.

827
00:34:37.570 --> 00:34:39.150
"Good luck."

828
00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:40.342
LAURA: Essek?

829
00:34:40.342 --> 00:34:43.470
Do you know of any like ruins around here or anything?

830
00:34:43.470 --> 00:34:44.820
Have you heard of anything?

831
00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:46.480
MATT: "I have

832
00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:47.420
"no idea."

833
00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:48.253
LAURA: Okay.

834
00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:50.530
MARISHA: Hey, Essek.

835
00:34:50.530 --> 00:34:52.413
MATT: "Yes?"
MARISHA: Are you mad at us?

836
00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:54.940
MATT: "Mad is not the right word.

837
00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:56.090
"I would say

838
00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:00.596
"ready to leave."

839
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:03.080
LAURA: At least he didn't say disappointed.

840
00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:04.600
I feel like disappointed

841
00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:06.540
is the absolute worst thing.
TALIESIN: It's three small words

842
00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:09.501
that's now combined into one big feeling.

843
00:35:09.501 --> 00:35:12.620
MARISHA: We haven't forgotten that we owe you a favor

844
00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:15.870
and that you wanted to talk to us about needing something.

845
00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:17.250
So hey, you're at the top

846
00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:21.120
of our list as soon as this is done.

847
00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:23.980
MATT: "A number of favors, I have not forgotten."

848
00:35:26.107 --> 00:35:28.960
MARISHA: Neither have we!

849
00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:30.890
MATT: "But in all honesty, be careful

850
00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:33.400
"and be safe, do not be stupid.

851
00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:38.130
"And good-bye."

852
00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:39.820
You watch as he finishes casting that spell

853
00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:41.170
he was subtly signing in the air

854
00:35:41.170 --> 00:35:43.900
and you watch him just fly through the canopy

855
00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:46.880
as he goes through, not rocketing out like Superman

856
00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:49.090
but just drifts up with a fair bit of speed.

857
00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:51.190
Some of the branches snap and fall

858
00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:52.740
from where he was and there's a brief little bit

859
00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:54.260
of light that peeks through where

860
00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:56.330
he pushed his way through the treeline.

861
00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:58.380
LAURA: Wow.
LIAM: He just ascended.

862
00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:01.907
SAM: Now, I hate to be a Negative Nottie here, but

863
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:06.540
part of the reason I was sort of pro-north end of the forest

864
00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:09.920
is now we're here and we don't know if we are

865
00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:12.590
ahead of them or behind them and there's

866
00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:15.260
no mathematical way of figuring that out.

867
00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:17.350
LAURA: Well, I could scry on them again.

868
00:36:17.350 --> 00:36:19.750
LIAM: First of all, you should have spoken up sooner.

869
00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:20.583
MARISHA: Yeah.

870
00:36:20.583 --> 00:36:22.300
LIAM: Second of all, we have not spoken

871
00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:25.440
to Caduceus yet, who sometimes you are able

872
00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:27.840
to have a feeling between you and your--

873
00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:30.015
TALIESIN: I can do that. I also--

874
00:36:31.468 --> 00:36:33.720
Are we looking for ruins you think, or?

875
00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:35.410
LIAM: We are looking for the heart.

876
00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:36.590
TALIESIN: Well, where would you put a heart

877
00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:38.400
if you were trying to keep it safe?

878
00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:41.160
TRAVIS: I don't know, perhaps at the base of a tree or ruin?

879
00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:42.740
Like you said, ruins, maybe

880
00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:45.050
some sort of a geological marker?

881
00:36:47.050 --> 00:36:51.730
TALIESIN: Well, I usually like to start
by asking the locals.

882
00:36:51.730 --> 00:36:55.810
So I'm going to take a few steps away from the group.

883
00:36:55.810 --> 00:36:56.920
TRAVIS: Warming it up.

884
00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:59.328
SAM: Can you talk to animals or plants or both?

885
00:36:59.328 --> 00:37:00.703
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah.

886
00:37:00.703 --> 00:37:05.097
(laughter)

887
00:37:07.564 --> 00:37:11.314
Hey everybody, don't mean to intrude.

888
00:37:11.314 --> 00:37:13.120
Obviously, there's a lot going on here,

889
00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:16.999
but we're going to be walking around

890
00:37:16.999 --> 00:37:19.570
for probably the next couple days

891
00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:24.265
and there's some other people wandering through

892
00:37:25.123 --> 00:37:26.810
the swamp forest right now

893
00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:29.260
that are, they're bad business.

894
00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:31.840
They're probably going to do a lot of damage,

895
00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:34.790
possibly a fire, who knows?

896
00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:36.620
But we're trying to take care of that.

897
00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:38.580
If there's any ruins around,

898
00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:43.580
if you've seen any like tall man-made structures

899
00:37:44.110 --> 00:37:46.630
slowly collapsing anywhere around here,

900
00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:50.480
we'd really appreciate a helping hand

901
00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:53.190
and we'll try our best to stay out of everybody's way.

902
00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:54.890
Especially if there's any birds.

903
00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:56.440
Hey, up there.

904
00:37:58.103 --> 00:37:59.490
If you've seen anything, we'd love to just

905
00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:02.560
get in and out with as little hassle as possible.

906
00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:04.800
Thanks, that'd be great.

907
00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:07.100
MATT: So you're just talking to the nature around you?

908
00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:08.783
TALIESIN and MATT: Yeah, yeah.

909
00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:11.933
MATT: As you finish the conversation,

910
00:38:11.933 --> 00:38:16.500
there's a slight pause and you watch a (buzzing)

911
00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:18.560
little fly just lands on his face.

912
00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:19.753
TALIESIN: Hey.

913
00:38:19.753 --> 00:38:21.278
MATT: (buzzing)

914
00:38:21.278 --> 00:38:23.270
Takes off.
TALIESIN: Follow that fly.

915
00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:24.103
MARISHA: What?

916
00:38:24.103 --> 00:38:25.580
LIAM: Side note, as soon as he starts,

917
00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:28.140
as soon as Reindeer Games starts talking to the trees,

918
00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:29.610
Caleb goes into meditative state

919
00:38:29.610 --> 00:38:32.180
and starts doing arcane recovery.

920
00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:33.308
MATT: So you're taking taking a short rest?

921
00:38:33.308 --> 00:38:34.424
LIAM: Taking a short rest, yeah.
MATT: You guys are taking a short rest?

922
00:38:34.424 --> 00:38:35.434
LIAM: I am.

923
00:38:35.434 --> 00:38:37.459
TALIESIN: Which direction was that fly headed?

924
00:38:37.459 --> 00:38:38.620
MATT: Make a perception check.

925
00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:40.970
LIAM: I'm trying to pull in some arcane mojo.

926
00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:45.330
TALIESIN: Where'd I put my d20s?

927
00:38:45.330 --> 00:38:46.420
That's 23.

928
00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:48.854
MATT: Great, you watch the fly (buzzing).

929
00:38:48.854 --> 00:38:50.173
(chomping)

930
00:38:50.173 --> 00:38:51.790
Eaten by a frog.
(laughter)

931
00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:53.104
TALIESIN: Who ate it?

932
00:38:53.104 --> 00:38:55.385
MATT: A little toad about maybe like--

933
00:38:55.385 --> 00:38:58.439
TALIESIN: I'm going to walk over to the toad and look down.

934
00:38:58.439 --> 00:38:59.365
MATT: (croaking)

935
00:38:59.365 --> 00:39:01.754
TALIESIN: Not cool, man.

936
00:39:01.754 --> 00:39:03.264
That was not cool.

937
00:39:03.264 --> 00:39:04.779
MATT: (croaking)

938
00:39:04.779 --> 00:39:06.792
TALIESIN: I don't suppose that you feel like helping?

939
00:39:07.645 --> 00:39:08.478
MATT: (croaking)

940
00:39:08.478 --> 00:39:10.210
TALIESIN: Yeah, I thought not.

941
00:39:10.210 --> 00:39:13.699
(laughter)

942
00:39:13.699 --> 00:39:15.830
Go on, get out.

943
00:39:15.830 --> 00:39:17.180
MATT: (croaking)

944
00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:18.610
He starts like leaping off.

945
00:39:18.610 --> 00:39:20.170
TRAVIS: Are we following the frog, the toad?

946
00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:22.239
TALIESIN: No, he's no help.
TRAVIS: All right.

947
00:39:22.239 --> 00:39:24.489
(laughter)

948
00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:29.540
TALIESIN: Are we taking a brief, short rest then?

949
00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:31.470
LAURA: I mean--
SAM: While we do,

950
00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:33.290
is there anything else you've got in your?

951
00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:34.440
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, that was just round one.

952
00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:36.020
LAURA: We don't want to sit here for an hour.

953
00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:37.450
TALIESIN: No, we don't want to sit, but I mean--

954
00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:38.480
SAM: It's getting dark.

955
00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:40.420
TRAVIS: If we don't hear anything moving largely

956
00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:42.270
through the trees of immense size--

957
00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:43.760
TALIESIN: I only need a minute.
TRAVIS: Perhaps we should try your

958
00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:46.900
spell to see if we can locate her sword?

959
00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:48.320
LAURA: Yeah.

960
00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:51.790
MARISHA: I'll do the old classic climb a tree.

961
00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:53.960
LAURA: Yeah, they're tall trees, right?

962
00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:55.690
MARISHA: Climb the tree thing first.

963
00:39:55.690 --> 00:39:57.390
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make an athletics check for me.

964
00:39:57.390 --> 00:39:59.020
SAM: Want to race up there?
LAURA: Guidance.

965
00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:01.370
The Traveler loves you so much, Beau.

966
00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:03.830
MATT: Athletics or acrobatics, your choice.

967
00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:05.050
MARISHA: You want a round two?

968
00:40:05.050 --> 00:40:06.220
You want a rematch?
SAM: Round two.

969
00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:07.790
MARISHA: All right, all right.
SAM: I can go up as well.

970
00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:09.190
MARISHA: Ready, and--
MATT: All right.

971
00:40:10.718 --> 00:40:12.440
MARISHA: Go!

972
00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:13.273
Fuck.

973
00:40:13.273 --> 00:40:15.420
LAURA: Plus four, you got guided.

974
00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:16.590
MARISHA: What is that?
SAM: 23.

975
00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:18.670
MATT: Plus a d4.
LAURA: Plus a d4, Beau.

976
00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:20.605
MARISHA: Plus a d4, I got guided?

977
00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:22.900
Terrible,

978
00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:24.050
19.

979
00:40:24.050 --> 00:40:26.550
MATT: All right, so as you both leap up on two different trees

980
00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:29.540
about 12 feet from each other, Beau like

981
00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:31.600
jumping and grabbing and leaping and spinning,

982
00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:33.090
you just skittering up the side,

983
00:40:33.090 --> 00:40:34.650
using your dagger to wade yourself

984
00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:36.560
across the weird, moss-covered bark.

985
00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:38.460
It's little slipperier than you expected

986
00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:39.560
from just the atmosphere here,

987
00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:41.310
the bit of vegetative growth that's

988
00:40:41.310 --> 00:40:43.870
begun to grow up and hold onto the side

989
00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:46.230
of these trees and their bark,

990
00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:47.520
but you do manage to skitter up there.

991
00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:49.970
Nott does get there a little bit before you do.

992
00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:50.990
SAM: Woo.
MARISHA: Fuck.

993
00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:53.410
SAM: Best two out of three next time.

994
00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:54.660
MARISHA: All right, deal.

995
00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:57.420
MATT: And best you can peek up,

996
00:40:57.420 --> 00:40:59.580
the downside of Nott is Nott a bit shorter than you

997
00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:02.280
and you get a little bit of a better view past--

998
00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:03.390
MARISHA: Here Nott, get on my shoulder.

999
00:41:03.390 --> 00:41:04.914
MATT: The broken parts of the canopy.

1000
00:41:04.914 --> 00:41:07.470
MARISHA: Can I put Nott on my shoulders?

1001
00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:08.680
MATT: Yeah.

1002
00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:11.320
And so with that, it's not like a beautiful view.

1003
00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:12.290
This isn't the tallest tree

1004
00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:13.820
of the entire forest that gives you a view.

1005
00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:16.180
You're just able to see through elements of the canopy

1006
00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:17.910
that otherwise would not be visible.

1007
00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:19.190
And peeking out southward,

1008
00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:22.458
you can see the top of the Lotusden Greenwood

1009
00:41:22.458 --> 00:41:24.670
the roll, it looks like rolling hills

1010
00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:28.440
but made of deep, deep green,

1011
00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:33.390
in some cases gray-type branches and leaves.

1012
00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:36.380
You can see in the distance, the sky's getting,

1013
00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:38.280
starting to get pushing towards a sunset,

1014
00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:41.180
like dusk is maybe an hour, hour and a half off.

1015
00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:43.873
And

1016
00:41:45.276 --> 00:41:49.200
it's beautiful and it's weirdly alien landscape.

1017
00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:50.850
SAM: Any smoke, any clearings?

1018
00:41:50.850 --> 00:41:52.710
MATT: Make a perception check.
MARISHA: Wiggling trees?

1019
00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:55.020
LAURA: I can't guide you, I'm too far away.

1020
00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:57.160
SAM: Don't worry, I got this.

1021
00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:58.510
MARISHA: What'd you say, perception, babe?

1022
00:41:58.510 --> 00:42:00.020
LAURA: Yeah.

1023
00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:01.940
SAM: 19.

1024
00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:03.480
MARISHA: Better than me.

1025
00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:04.313
12.

1026
00:42:05.370 --> 00:42:07.280
MATT: You look about.

1027
00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:10.150
You know, there are a few birds that like (puffing),

1028
00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:13.390
like a small cluster of some sort of large bird

1029
00:42:13.390 --> 00:42:16.580
a little more south, southwest of you.

1030
00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:18.700
The wind picks up in one area

1031
00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:20.930
and you can see the gentle sway of the canopy,

1032
00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:24.292
but it's a large area, not a singular path.

1033
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:28.900
After a few minutes, not much about a specific sign

1034
00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:33.240
of nearby movement that would be a symbol.

1035
00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:34.900
MARISHA: But we kind of have a general direction

1036
00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:37.030
of the thick of the forest?

1037
00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:39.160
MATT: You guys are in the center, more or less,

1038
00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:40.490
of the Lotus Greenwood.

1039
00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:44.780
You are, who knows what, really where you are

1040
00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:48.500
and which way is a direction other than where you go.

1041
00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:49.590
TALIESIN: Anybody have any questions

1042
00:42:49.590 --> 00:42:51.290
they want to ask or should I just?

1043
00:42:52.528 --> 00:42:53.970
LAURA: You going to commune?
TALIESIN: I'm going to commune,

1044
00:42:53.970 --> 00:42:56.030
see what I get.
LAURA: I think that's smart.

1045
00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:58.588
I'm going to ask the Traveler, too.

1046
00:42:59.539 --> 00:43:01.850
TRAVIS: Could she point us in a direction?

1047
00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:04.022
What are we looking for?

1048
00:43:04.022 --> 00:43:06.190
MARISHA: Any ruins?
TALIESIN: I'll see what I can do.

1049
00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:09.110
MARISHA: Any evil things to look out for?

1050
00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:09.943
TRAVIS: Yep.

1051
00:43:09.943 --> 00:43:11.200
TALIESIN: It's not really--

1052
00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:12.700
TRAVIS: What's today's lotto number?

1053
00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:17.880
LAURA: You should say, should we go north or south?

1054
00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:19.010
TALIESIN: That I can kind of ask.

1055
00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:20.120
LIAM: Yes or no questions, right?

1056
00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:22.030
TALIESIN: Yes.
SAM: Should we go south?

1057
00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:22.863
TALIESIN: So,

1058
00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:25.602
I am casting Commune.

1059
00:43:25.602 --> 00:43:27.360
MATT: Okay.

1060
00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:31.160
So you are suffused in

1061
00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:34.743
nature, though maybe not the most

1062
00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:36.775
benevolent

1063
00:43:37.690 --> 00:43:41.010
space per se, but the smell is familiar

1064
00:43:41.010 --> 00:43:43.050
and based on where you grew up in the Savalirwood,

1065
00:43:43.050 --> 00:43:45.450
there is a familiarity to coexisting

1066
00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:49.382
with a dangerous bit of unbridled wild.

1067
00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:51.700
So you close your eyes.

1068
00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:53.340
You focus, you light your incense.

1069
00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:57.940
You begin to concentrate on your deity

1070
00:43:57.940 --> 00:44:00.930
and within a short time, the sensation of your physical body

1071
00:44:00.930 --> 00:44:03.940
begins to fade and you begin to discorporate

1072
00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:07.230
into a warmer space, a familiar space,

1073
00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:10.340
a space of connection and there you can

1074
00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:12.993
sense her presence awaiting your questions.

1075
00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:17.303
TALIESIN: The object we seek, this heart,

1076
00:44:18.982 --> 00:44:20.615
is it to the south of us?

1077
00:44:22.770 --> 00:44:25.054
MATT: You hear a breeze blow.

1078
00:44:25.054 --> 00:44:27.660
(whooshing)

1079
00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:29.880
The breeze is warm, and it seems to,

1080
00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:31.810
based on where you are sitting, blow in

1081
00:44:31.810 --> 00:44:35.600
like a south, southwestern direction.

1082
00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:44.200
TALIESIN: Is it in a temple or a building?

1083
00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:47.720
Is it protected by something built by

1084
00:44:49.298 --> 00:44:50.773
civilization?

1085
00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:53.832
MATT: This time,

1086
00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:57.340
you sense an absence of stone,

1087
00:44:57.340 --> 00:45:02.310
an absence of mortar, an absence of humanoid mind and hands.

1088
00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:04.120
Instead, just

1089
00:45:05.310 --> 00:45:06.593
natural

1090
00:45:09.186 --> 00:45:11.269
imprisonment methods.

1091
00:45:13.204 --> 00:45:14.920
MARISHA: Natural imprisonment methods.

1092
00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:16.520
TALIESIN: The others who seek this object,

1093
00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:18.303
are they ahead of us?

1094
00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:22.690
MATT: The wind blows once more
in the southwestern direction,

1095
00:45:22.690 --> 00:45:26.490
but it is cold and stronger.

1096
00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:28.180
You gather,

1097
00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:29.455
yes.

1098
00:45:30.910 --> 00:45:33.270
TALIESIN: It's to the southwest, south-southwest.

1099
00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:34.730
They are ahead of us.

1100
00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:36.000
SAM: They're ahead of us.

1101
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.150
TALIESIN: There's no building.

1102
00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:41.590
It's guarded by some other mechanism.

1103
00:45:41.590 --> 00:45:43.016
I couldn't say.

1104
00:45:43.016 --> 00:45:43.849
LAURA: They're ahead of us still.

1105
00:45:43.849 --> 00:45:46.340
TRAVIS: I'm glad we jumped this far ahead.

1106
00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:49.680
South-southwest, nothing man-made.

1107
00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:51.820
What can that be, roots, trees, amber?

1108
00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:53.610
TALIESIN: It could be a magic tree.

1109
00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:55.620
Could be a briar, could be a swamp.

1110
00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:56.730
Don't know.

1111
00:45:56.730 --> 00:45:58.960
MARISHA: I mean, this entire forest feels like

1112
00:46:00.203 --> 00:46:02.146
an imprisonment device.

1113
00:46:03.490 --> 00:46:04.460
LAURA: No offense.

1114
00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:07.020
MARISHA: Yeah, I mean, you're great.

1115
00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:08.440
TALIESIN: I don't think they can understand you.

1116
00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:09.340
MARISHA: Oh, okay then.

1117
00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:11.495
TRAVIS: We're about to lose

1118
00:46:11.495 --> 00:46:13.920
the light, should we move as long as we can?

1119
00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:14.753
LAURA: Yeah.

1120
00:46:14.753 --> 00:46:17.360
TRAVIS: Should we try and locate now or tomorrow, Jester?

1121
00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:18.620
What would you?

1122
00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:21.440
LAURA: Did she say how far ahead of us they were?

1123
00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:23.500
TALIESIN: No, no.

1124
00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:27.100
LAURA: Well, I can, you know, try to locate.

1125
00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:29.320
We can travel for a little bit and then I can

1126
00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:32.980
cast Locate Object and see if I can get a bead on them.

1127
00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:34.560
MARISHA: Yeah, how far is the range for that?

1128
00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:36.500
LAURA: 1,000 feet.
SAM: Why don't we walk?

1129
00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:37.960
How long does it last?

1130
00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:38.793
LAURA: 10 minutes.

1131
00:46:38.793 --> 00:46:41.710
SAM: Why don't we walk for 25 minutes

1132
00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:43.490
and then do it or something?
LAURA: And then I'll cast it.

1133
00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:44.590
TALIESIN: At the end of, once we think

1134
00:46:44.590 --> 00:46:46.300
we're close to bedding down for the night?

1135
00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:47.133
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1136
00:46:47.133 --> 00:46:48.880
TALIESIN: Because this place is probably going to

1137
00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:50.850
get very dangerous when the sun gets down.

1138
00:46:50.850 --> 00:46:51.894
LAURA: Yeah.

1139
00:46:51.894 --> 00:46:53.972
MARISHA: And it'll get dark very quickly in this forest.

1140
00:46:53.972 --> 00:46:54.805
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1141
00:46:54.805 --> 00:46:55.975
TRAVIS: Should we be trying,

1142
00:46:55.975 --> 00:46:57.950
do you remember if they were moving urgently, walking?

1143
00:46:57.950 --> 00:46:59.830
Were they jogging, whatever?

1144
00:46:59.830 --> 00:47:02.770
LAURA: They seemed like they were walking with a purpose,

1145
00:47:02.770 --> 00:47:04.760
but it didn't seem like they were going very quickly.

1146
00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:08.358
It's like they were trying to find it.

1147
00:47:09.290 --> 00:47:10.739
MARISHA: Power walking.
LAURA: They couldn't be moving quickly.

1148
00:47:10.739 --> 00:47:13.223
I don't think they knew exactly where it was.

1149
00:47:13.223 --> 00:47:15.210
TRAVIS: I'm of the inclination that we should at least

1150
00:47:15.210 --> 00:47:18.110
be trying to make up ground, but we'll be loud.

1151
00:47:20.610 --> 00:47:21.910
SAM: Well, we're not going to make

1152
00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:23.338
any ground if we just talk about it.

1153
00:47:23.338 --> 00:47:24.500
LAURA: Let's keep walking.
SAM: Let's go.

1154
00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:26.250
MARISHA: Yeah, and eventually they'll show signs

1155
00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:27.550
of where they've been through,

1156
00:47:27.550 --> 00:47:30.570
so we just keep an eye out for broken twigs.

1157
00:47:30.570 --> 00:47:31.870
SAM: Yeah, we should maybe spread out.

1158
00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:32.703
MARISHA: Clearings.

1159
00:47:32.703 --> 00:47:34.613
TRAVIS: Do a fire line, yes. Good call.

1160
00:47:34.613 --> 00:47:35.480
MATT: Okay.

1161
00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:37.160
So you guys are keeping a fire line?

1162
00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:38.560
What is the fire line order?

1163
00:47:39.650 --> 00:47:42.070
TRAVIS: Do you want to do 10 feet between each other?

1164
00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:43.850
SAM: 10 feet between sounds great.

1165
00:47:43.850 --> 00:47:44.683
MARISHA: Sure.

1166
00:47:44.683 --> 00:47:46.470
LIAM: Caleb snaps out of his meditation,

1167
00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:48.250
realizing that everyone is moving

1168
00:47:48.250 --> 00:47:50.170
and does not regain anything.

1169
00:47:50.170 --> 00:47:51.520
He realizes that we're on the move.

1170
00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:55.330
LAURA: I think I should be--
MATT: What order should you be in?

1171
00:47:55.330 --> 00:47:57.577
LIAM: Second to last!

1172
00:47:57.577 --> 00:47:58.410
LAURA: Pretty good.

1173
00:47:58.410 --> 00:47:59.810
LIAM: Oh, we're walking in a fire line?

1174
00:47:59.810 --> 00:48:01.250
MATT: Fire line.
LIAM: Okay, cool.

1175
00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:03.070
MATT: All right, how far apart?

1176
00:48:03.070 --> 00:48:07.500
ALL: 10 feet.
MATT: 10 feet, all right.

1177
00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:10.150
I'll say one of you can make a perception check

1178
00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:12.210
and one of you can make a survival check with advantage

1179
00:48:12.210 --> 00:48:13.410
because you're doing it as a group.

1180
00:48:13.410 --> 00:48:14.490
I'll allow that.
LAURA: I'll make survival.

1181
00:48:14.490 --> 00:48:16.380
TALIESIN: I'll make perception.
MATT: All right.

1182
00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:19.230
Helming this, we have Caduceus and Jester, go ahead.

1183
00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:20.110
LAURA: With advantage?

1184
00:48:20.110 --> 00:48:22.090
MATT: With advantage because
everyone is helping in this one.

1185
00:48:22.090 --> 00:48:23.670
TALIESIN: I don't have advantage on that, or?

1186
00:48:23.670 --> 00:48:25.550
MATT: You do.

1187
00:48:25.550 --> 00:48:27.010
LAURA: 24.

1188
00:48:27.010 --> 00:48:27.990
SAM: 25.

1189
00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:28.823
MARISHA: Nice.

1190
00:48:28.823 --> 00:48:29.720
SAM: The rolls tonight.

1191
00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:31.107
LAURA: We should have guided each other.

1192
00:48:31.107 --> 00:48:32.393
TRAVIS: We're going to get that later.

1193
00:48:32.393 --> 00:48:34.643
(laughter)

1194
00:48:35.557 --> 00:48:36.390
LAURA: Next time.

1195
00:48:36.390 --> 00:48:39.026
MATT: That's basically the Troy-Abed handshake.

1196
00:48:40.717 --> 00:48:41.858
LAURA: I don't know, I have no idea.

1197
00:48:41.858 --> 00:48:43.080
TALIESIN: You don't know how to do this?

1198
00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:44.530
LAURA: I don't know what you're doing.

1199
00:48:47.072 --> 00:48:49.680
SAM: Come on, Laura, let's do it.

1200
00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:50.513
MATT: Okay.

1201
00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:52.773
Okay.

1202
00:48:56.210 --> 00:48:57.420
Caduceus, you're the first to mention

1203
00:48:57.420 --> 00:49:00.430
about 30 minutes into this travel,

1204
00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:02.960
as you guys are just starting to think it's

1205
00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:05.160
the cusp of when you should probably stop searching

1206
00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:07.740
or at least begin to, if you were planning to bed down

1207
00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:10.110
for the night, start looking for a safe place to go.

1208
00:49:10.110 --> 00:49:14.230
You begin to notice a bit of a swath

1209
00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:17.750
of branch and vine that appears to have been cut

1210
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:20.190
and you glance over towards it and pick up one

1211
00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:21.370
and the cut is recent.

1212
00:49:21.370 --> 00:49:23.530
You can see the vine itself,

1213
00:49:23.530 --> 00:49:26.747
the interior nutrients of the matter

1214
00:49:26.747 --> 00:49:29.120
is still freshly bleeding.

1215
00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:34.061
It's slightly, milky material.

1216
00:49:34.061 --> 00:49:35.510
And looking about on the floor

1217
00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:36.680
as you point this out to Jester,

1218
00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:39.655
you notice there are a few sets of footprints.

1219
00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:42.940
LAURA: They would have faded pretty quickly, too.

1220
00:49:44.870 --> 00:49:46.830
MATT: You gather with your survival roll,

1221
00:49:46.830 --> 00:49:48.344
at least in the last day.

1222
00:49:48.344 --> 00:49:49.370
LAURA: Okay.

1223
00:49:49.370 --> 00:49:50.890
Okay, last day.

1224
00:49:50.890 --> 00:49:54.140
MARISHA: Do demons sleep?

1225
00:49:54.140 --> 00:49:57.250
Do people who are mind-controlled get tired?

1226
00:49:57.250 --> 00:49:59.150
Or are they like hey, it's dark, we should--

1227
00:49:59.150 --> 00:50:00.640
LAURA: Maybe that's why Laughing Hand is crazy.

1228
00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:02.250
Maybe they don't let him sleep.

1229
00:50:02.250 --> 00:50:04.430
LIAM: We've seen Yasha be tired, though.

1230
00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:05.560
LAURA: Well yeah, but not while

1231
00:50:05.560 --> 00:50:07.753
she's had this orange thingy on her back.

1232
00:50:07.753 --> 00:50:08.850
TRAVIS: When you saw her, did she look

1233
00:50:08.850 --> 00:50:10.510
sunken-eyed, tired, withdrawn?

1234
00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:11.343
LAURA: She looked like she'd been crying a lot.

1235
00:50:11.343 --> 00:50:12.176
I don't know.

1236
00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:15.050
SAM: Her face was very pale.

1237
00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:18.130
TALIESIN: And sleeping is, they've got to sleep.

1238
00:50:18.130 --> 00:50:19.300
LAURA: Plus she's got that makeup,

1239
00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:20.460
covers the dark circles.

1240
00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:22.660
MARISHA: I'm just curious,

1241
00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:26.610
because we could try and sneak up on their camp if we think

1242
00:50:26.610 --> 00:50:30.460
that they might stop for a camp, but I don't know.

1243
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:33.060
Generally, I feel like--

1244
00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:34.190
TALIESIN: And then what?

1245
00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:36.060
MARISHA: Ambush.

1246
00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:37.250
TRAVIS: Wait, that's actually a good point.

1247
00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:39.250
SAM: What?

1248
00:50:39.250 --> 00:50:41.924
TRAVIS: If we are behind them--
MARISHA: We can ambush them.

1249
00:50:41.924 --> 00:50:43.590
TRAVIS: Well, we could ambush them

1250
00:50:43.590 --> 00:50:45.100
or we could try and go around them

1251
00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:46.500
and try and pass them in the night.

1252
00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:47.900
But if we are ambushing them,

1253
00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:51.090
didn't you say that someone had something on their hip?

1254
00:50:51.090 --> 00:50:54.070
LAURA: We could sneak in, be invisible and super-stealthy

1255
00:50:54.070 --> 00:50:57.010
and then you can just go and take the skull from him.

1256
00:50:57.010 --> 00:50:59.340
And that way, we don't even need to get to the heart first.

1257
00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:01.490
We just need to get the skull and get away.

1258
00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:03.230
MARISHA: Because it's just about stopping the ritual, right?

1259
00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:04.063
LAURA: Right.

1260
00:51:04.063 --> 00:51:06.050
MARISHA: But this only makes sense

1261
00:51:06.050 --> 00:51:09.902
if crazed demon-people in search of skulls sleep.

1262
00:51:09.902 --> 00:51:12.140
LIAM: I have another idea as well that we could do.

1263
00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:13.300
LAURA: We're still walking forward.

1264
00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:14.200
MATT: Right.

1265
00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:15.300
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, in addition to this,

1266
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:21.360
we could try to just take the skull and Yasha.

1267
00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:27.320
If you're able to run and give her a hug and pull her out,

1268
00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:29.190
we could go.

1269
00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:31.000
MARISHA: Yasha's--

1270
00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.820
LIAM: We could deal with that after the fact.

1271
00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:34.810
We could take her--
SAM: She's a bad person.

1272
00:51:34.810 --> 00:51:36.720
She hates us and wants to kill us, she's evil.

1273
00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:40.210
MARISHA: Her imprisonment isn't tangible, it's in her head.

1274
00:51:40.210 --> 00:51:43.360
LIAM: What if we were able to separate her from these things?

1275
00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:45.300
TALIESIN: I don't know if we have that power here.

1276
00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:47.050
SAM: Do you have that power?

1277
00:51:47.050 --> 00:51:49.460
LIAM: To take her away or to clear her mind?

1278
00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:50.330
SAM: To clear her mind.

1279
00:51:50.330 --> 00:51:52.590
LIAM: I do not know, but we have a better chance of that

1280
00:51:52.590 --> 00:51:55.140
if we get her away from them than if she is with them.

1281
00:51:55.140 --> 00:52:00.140
MARISHA: Have you ever tried to tame a wild, caged rat?

1282
00:52:00.690 --> 00:52:03.940
Imagine that, but Yasha's size, trying to come at us.

1283
00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:06.350
LIAM: I have watched you make someone vanish

1284
00:52:06.350 --> 00:52:08.410
and reappear somewhere else.
SAM: Or turn into a turtle.

1285
00:52:08.410 --> 00:52:13.280
LAURA: But Caleb, I can do that, but I can only do it quickly

1286
00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:15.760
if someone is willing to come with me.

1287
00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:18.460
If they are not, then there's a very real

1288
00:52:18.460 --> 00:52:20.670
possibility that I could go and hug her

1289
00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:22.470
and then she would chop my head off.

1290
00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:25.650
TRAVIS: And that would be bad, so we're clear.

1291
00:52:25.650 --> 00:52:26.840
LAURA: Probably, I mean, I don't know,

1292
00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:28.830
I think Caduceus could still bring me back

1293
00:52:28.830 --> 00:52:30.710
but only if he could get to me.

1294
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:32.500
MARISHA: I really like your head

1295
00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:34.030
on your body.

1296
00:52:34.030 --> 00:52:37.872
TALIESIN: Not sure I really want to experiment with that just yet.

1297
00:52:37.872 --> 00:52:40.240
I liked the intention of the plan.

1298
00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:41.760
I just don't think--
SAM: He just said you were,

1299
00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:42.970
your head was attractive.

1300
00:52:42.970 --> 00:52:45.080
TALIESIN: I think that if we're going to get her out of this,

1301
00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:47.240
we're going to have to be careful

1302
00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:48.550
and that doesn't sound careful.

1303
00:52:48.550 --> 00:52:49.480
That sounds

1304
00:52:51.478 --> 00:52:52.311
fraught.

1305
00:52:52.311 --> 00:52:53.390
LIAM: Going toe-to-toe does not seem

1306
00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:54.610
like a very good idea to me.

1307
00:52:54.610 --> 00:52:55.660
It didn't go very well the last time.

1308
00:52:55.660 --> 00:52:57.670
LAURA: That's why we don't want to go to-to-toe.

1309
00:52:57.670 --> 00:53:01.730
We want to sneak in before they awake

1310
00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:04.610
and then just steal it and then run away.

1311
00:53:04.610 --> 00:53:05.443
No toes.

1312
00:53:05.443 --> 00:53:06.960
TALIESIN: Slow them down while we get stronger.

1313
00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:08.390
Make them weaker while we get stronger.

1314
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:11.750
TRAVIS: No toes. No capes.

1315
00:53:13.111 --> 00:53:15.380
SAM: We have to find them first for any of these plans,

1316
00:53:15.380 --> 00:53:17.010
even the ambush one.
LAURA: Should I cast it?

1317
00:53:17.010 --> 00:53:19.000
Do you think it's a little early, what do you think?

1318
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.480
SAM: Still too early.

1319
00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:22.740
MARISHA: Let's follow the tracks.

1320
00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:23.960
TALIESIN: Stealthily.

1321
00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:26.120
LAURA: If the footprints start looking fresher,

1322
00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:28.170
we need to, I'm going, you know?

1323
00:53:28.170 --> 00:53:30.890
Because I'm assuming they'll

1324
00:53:30.890 --> 00:53:33.690
look more and more fresh the more we follow them.

1325
00:53:33.690 --> 00:53:36.020
MARISHA: Well, I'm good at investigating.

1326
00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:38.690
That feels like an investigating thing, right?

1327
00:53:38.690 --> 00:53:41.220
MATT: That would probably be one aspect of it, yeah.

1328
00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:42.380
MATT: Yes,

1329
00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:43.590
because you're not trying to find the tracks.

1330
00:53:43.590 --> 00:53:45.300
You're just trying to--
MARISHA: Discern how--

1331
00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:46.190
MATT: Discern, yeah.

1332
00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:47.350
MARISHA: Can I actually do that

1333
00:53:47.350 --> 00:53:49.450
with one of the tracks that I see now?

1334
00:53:49.450 --> 00:53:51.430
MATT: Go ahead and roll an investigation.

1335
00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:53.770
TALIESIN: I'll give you a d4 for that.
MARISHA: Thank you.

1336
00:53:53.770 --> 00:53:55.620
TALIESIN: If I see you doing that.

1337
00:53:56.500 --> 00:53:57.940
MARISHA: Oh, my goodness.

1338
00:53:57.940 --> 00:54:00.320
I roll terrible on investigation checks.

1339
00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:01.980
TALIESIN: Except this time.

1340
00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:03.420
No, maybe not.

1341
00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:04.253
LIAM: No, this time too.

1342
00:54:04.253 --> 00:54:07.120
MARISHA: It teases me, it teases me every time.

1343
00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:07.953
I do.

1344
00:54:07.953 --> 00:54:09.650
TRAVIS: It's okay, it's not what you're known for or anything.

1345
00:54:09.650 --> 00:54:11.250
MARISHA: 15, it's not like the entire

1346
00:54:11.250 --> 00:54:13.850
basis of my fucking class or anything.

1347
00:54:13.850 --> 00:54:15.000
TALIESIN: You're more known for kicking ass

1348
00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.190
and less for taking names.

1349
00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:18.870
TRAVIS: All of us, some of us went to college

1350
00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:20.170
and we don't use that shit either.

1351
00:54:20.170 --> 00:54:21.620
LIAM: Is that a 10?
MARISHA: I'm going to fix that.

1352
00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:23.101
MARISHA: That's a plus six

1353
00:54:23.101 --> 00:54:24.230
to my investigation.

1354
00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:27.930
MATT: So looking about the tracks that Jester pointed out,

1355
00:54:27.930 --> 00:54:29.270
you guys are following as you go through

1356
00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:31.500
and here the trees can be anywhere from

1357
00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:33.560
10 to four feet from each other at times

1358
00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:34.840
and then they spread out a bit.

1359
00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:36.830
At this place, this particular place,

1360
00:54:36.830 --> 00:54:39.420
you can see where the heavy gash marks are

1361
00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:41.660
from what you imagine are either Yasha's blade

1362
00:54:41.660 --> 00:54:45.120
or the Laughing Hand's arm occasionally scraping

1363
00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:47.920
past one of the trees, freshly gouging

1364
00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:51.440
from the side and you can see bits of heavy branch

1365
00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:55.000
and clusters of leaves and bits of brush have

1366
00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.550
been cut and laid to the side as they move forward.

1367
00:55:00.002 --> 00:55:03.450
You can't really tell in hours how fresh they are.

1368
00:55:03.450 --> 00:55:05.450
It's hard to discern necessarily.

1369
00:55:06.380 --> 00:55:09.230
You do very much see two sets of humanoid footprints

1370
00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:13.890
and one much larger, heavier-footfall-based

1371
00:55:13.890 --> 00:55:14.790
set of footprints.

1372
00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:17.270
LAURA: Do the footprints seem tired?

1373
00:55:20.230 --> 00:55:21.063
MATT: Hard to tell.

1374
00:55:21.063 --> 00:55:23.360
TRAVIS: Is there a firm print and then a draggy toe,

1375
00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:25.580
another firm print and then a draggy toe?

1376
00:55:26.690 --> 00:55:28.831
MATT: An empty 5-hour ENERGY drink bottle.

1377
00:55:28.831 --> 00:55:30.519
(laughter)

1378
00:55:30.519 --> 00:55:32.930
LIAM: I don't want to destroy the world anymore.

1379
00:55:34.503 --> 00:55:35.860
MATT: You don't know.

1380
00:55:35.860 --> 00:55:36.693
MARISHA: Okay.

1381
00:55:38.392 --> 00:55:39.650
SAM: We keep on pushing on.
TRAVIS: Push on, push on.

1382
00:55:39.650 --> 00:55:41.190
TALIESIN: Yeah, I don't think we need a fire line

1383
00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:43.893
anymore now that we're following a trail.

1384
00:55:43.893 --> 00:55:45.920
MATT: So what is your marching order?

1385
00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:47.838
TRAVIS: Two by two, two by two.

1386
00:55:47.838 --> 00:55:49.857
♪ Two by two ♪

1387
00:55:49.857 --> 00:55:51.410
MATT: Who's in the front?
SAM: I will be.

1388
00:55:51.410 --> 00:55:52.610
MATT: Nott and who?

1389
00:55:53.479 --> 00:55:55.160
Who's in the front with Nott?

1390
00:55:55.160 --> 00:55:57.110
TRAVIS: I'll join Nott.

1391
00:55:57.110 --> 00:55:58.247
LAURA: I'll go in the middle.

1392
00:55:58.247 --> 00:55:59.387
MATT: Next in line?

1393
00:55:59.387 --> 00:56:00.220
LAURA: Middle next to Caleb.

1394
00:56:00.220 --> 00:56:02.150
MATT: All righty, and that puts Beau and Caduceus

1395
00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:02.983
in the back.

1396
00:56:02.983 --> 00:56:03.816
TALIESIN: Right there is perfect.

1397
00:56:03.816 --> 00:56:05.010
MATT: You got it, all righty.

1398
00:56:05.010 --> 00:56:06.150
SAM: Greens, blues.

1399
00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:08.263
Pinks.

1400
00:56:08.263 --> 00:56:10.010
MATT: There you go.

1401
00:56:10.010 --> 00:56:11.350
So,

1402
00:56:11.350 --> 00:56:13.140
pushing onward for the next

1403
00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:16.160
hour or so,

1404
00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:17.860
the little bit of light that's peeking

1405
00:56:17.860 --> 00:56:22.400
through the broken bits of upper tree canopy

1406
00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:24.570
begins to turn to a bright orange,

1407
00:56:26.310 --> 00:56:27.935
to a red, to a purple.

1408
00:56:27.935 --> 00:56:30.252
LAURA: I'm going to cast Locate Object just to be safe.

1409
00:56:30.252 --> 00:56:32.977
MATT: Okay, you cast Locate Object on?

1410
00:56:32.977 --> 00:56:34.331
LAURA: Yasha's sword.

1411
00:56:34.331 --> 00:56:35.164
MATT: Okay.

1412
00:56:36.607 --> 00:56:37.530
It does not pick up anything.

1413
00:56:37.530 --> 00:56:38.860
LAURA: Cool, I just want to be safe.

1414
00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:40.130
MATT: No worries.

1415
00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:42.540
SAM: So we can speed up and not be stealthy.

1416
00:56:43.590 --> 00:56:45.960
MATT: At about that hour point, you do come across

1417
00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:50.440
a small pseudo-clearing, I would say.

1418
00:56:51.670 --> 00:56:53.190
There appears to be an area where

1419
00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:54.410
some of the trees are a little more sparse.

1420
00:56:54.410 --> 00:56:57.220
The ground gets less swampy and mucky

1421
00:56:57.220 --> 00:56:58.920
and a little harder at this point.

1422
00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:01.940
You notice it first.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1423
00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:07.867
MATT: With Beauregard up second as you're the next in line.

1424
00:57:08.830 --> 00:57:11.300
Jester as well, actually because you're in front, yeah.

1425
00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:14.340
Jester probably noticed it the same time as you.

1426
00:57:14.340 --> 00:57:19.030
You do see two figures lying against the base of a tree.

1427
00:57:22.210 --> 00:57:23.043
MARISHA: Conscious?

1428
00:57:23.043 --> 00:57:24.787
MATT: It's darkened shadow. They're not moving.

1429
00:57:24.787 --> 00:57:25.862
MARISHA: Asleep?

1430
00:57:25.862 --> 00:57:27.980
SAM: Your Locate Object is not--?

1431
00:57:27.980 --> 00:57:29.980
LAURA: My Locate Object isn't doing anything?

1432
00:57:31.110 --> 00:57:32.320
TRAVIS: It's an hour later.

1433
00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:33.153
MATT: Nothing yet.

1434
00:57:35.050 --> 00:57:37.000
TALIESIN: Do we want to bed down here maybe

1435
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.490
and have a place to sleep if we have to

1436
00:57:39.490 --> 00:57:41.210
and a place to retreat to before--

1437
00:57:42.127 --> 00:57:43.420
LAURA: There's people asleep against the tree over there.

1438
00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:44.960
TALIESIN: Are they asleep, or are they--?

1439
00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:46.580
LIAM: Would you like my cat to take a look?

1440
00:57:46.580 --> 00:57:47.413
LAURA: Can we see them?

1441
00:57:47.413 --> 00:57:49.700
TRAVIS: Yes, yes, jungle cat, launch the jungle cat.

1442
00:57:50.650 --> 00:57:51.740
LIAM: Frumpkin is there next to me.

1443
00:57:51.740 --> 00:57:53.050
LAURA: What if it's an illusion?

1444
00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.870
LIAM: Go take a look, okay?

1445
00:57:55.870 --> 00:57:56.990
Quietly, carefully.

1446
00:57:56.990 --> 00:57:59.700
TALIESIN: I am keeping an eye all around for anything.

1447
00:57:59.700 --> 00:58:02.480
I'm trying to-- this feels ambushy.

1448
00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:03.438
MATT: Okay.

1449
00:58:03.438 --> 00:58:05.127
MARISHA: Yeah, is this a honey pot situation?

1450
00:58:05.127 --> 00:58:07.080
LAURA: It feels ambushy. I don't like it.

1451
00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:08.800
MATT: Frumpkin, roll a stealth check for Frumpkin.

1452
00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:10.920
LAURA: And can I guide Frumpkin?

1453
00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:12.930
LIAM: Yeah, you can.

1454
00:58:12.930 --> 00:58:15.240
MATT: It takes a round to happen, so.

1455
00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:16.073
LIAM: Seven.

1456
00:58:16.073 --> 00:58:18.000
TRAVIS: We all wave down and take

1457
00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:19.960
a knee so we like lower our profile.

1458
00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:21.590
LAURA: Yeah, we're all crouching.
MATT: You all get low.

1459
00:58:21.590 --> 00:58:22.660
At this point,

1460
00:58:23.965 --> 00:58:26.200
the roots and the forest floor is constantly changing

1461
00:58:26.200 --> 00:58:27.990
up and down based on proximity to the trees.

1462
00:58:27.990 --> 00:58:30.100
So there are some ridges and heavy roots

1463
00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:32.374
where you can get down a little bit.

1464
00:58:32.374 --> 00:58:33.350
And then for perspective here,

1465
00:58:33.350 --> 00:58:34.570
the trees here resemble,

1466
00:58:36.430 --> 00:58:37.890
you know the sequence in Lord of the Rings

1467
00:58:37.890 --> 00:58:39.990
where they hide from the Nazgûl?

1468
00:58:39.990 --> 00:58:41.940
that big old tree with the--
LIAM: Yeah.

1469
00:58:41.940 --> 00:58:43.600
MATT: The forest is a lot of that.

1470
00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:45.380
LIAM: Who can forget that tree?
MATT: Size and style of it.

1471
00:58:45.380 --> 00:58:49.330
Half the forest floor here is just roots

1472
00:58:49.330 --> 00:58:50.610
with bits of

1473
00:58:51.970 --> 00:58:54.490
compost decomposing between where leaves have fallen.

1474
00:58:54.490 --> 00:58:57.420
TALIESIN: Just for fun, I'm going to do Eyes of the Grave really quick.

1475
00:58:57.420 --> 00:58:58.300
MATT: Okay.

1476
00:58:58.300 --> 00:59:00.960
TALIESIN: And I'm going to cast Detect Magic really quick.

1477
00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:01.870
MATT: Okay.

1478
00:59:01.870 --> 00:59:03.020
You cast both of those.

1479
00:59:04.210 --> 00:59:05.430
No undead sensed.

1480
00:59:06.510 --> 00:59:10.120
Nothing magical beyond what you all have on your persons.

1481
00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:12.790
Frumpkin's stealth was?
LIAM: A massive eight.

1482
00:59:12.790 --> 00:59:16.810
MATT: Frumpkin continues out to about

1483
00:59:16.810 --> 00:59:19.620
40, 50 or so feet from where you guys are,

1484
00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:21.920
carefully heading toward these two bodies.

1485
00:59:22.980 --> 00:59:26.010
Right as Frumpkin gets about 10 feet from it,

1486
00:59:28.310 --> 00:59:32.840
he notices that they're not moving. They are dead.

1487
00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:33.910
They are two bodies.

1488
00:59:33.910 --> 00:59:35.560
One that appears to be

1489
00:59:36.870 --> 00:59:39.810
halfling, female, ruddy skin,

1490
00:59:39.810 --> 00:59:42.330
a tangled mess of dark hair

1491
00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:46.440
with leathers and looks like a backpack.

1492
00:59:47.590 --> 00:59:49.460
The other figure looks to be dragonborn.

1493
00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:50.940
A lithe, thin dragonborn.

1494
00:59:50.940 --> 00:59:53.610
Tall and lanky, copper-scaled.

1495
00:59:53.610 --> 00:59:56.660
And they're both-- not next to each other.

1496
00:59:56.660 --> 01:00:00.481
They're both six or seven feet from one another.

1497
01:00:00.481 --> 01:00:03.660
At a glance, they both have a couple of very,

1498
01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:06.380
very heavy gash wounds across their torso and abdomen.

1499
01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:10.560
LIAM: I say as I'm staring into nothing,

1500
01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:12.600
"Dead bodies, one moment."

1501
01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:14.020
And if Frumpkin's still in range,

1502
01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:16.420
I tell Frumpkin to very carefully bite each one.

1503
01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:21.503
MATT: Frumpkin looks back at you like (meows)?

1504
01:00:21.503 --> 01:00:23.090
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1505
01:00:23.090 --> 01:00:27.140
SAM: I'll remember this.

1506
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:30.710
MATT: No reaction.

1507
01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:31.710
LIAM: Yeah, dead bodies.

1508
01:00:34.548 --> 01:00:36.370
MARISHA: Yeah.

1509
01:00:36.370 --> 01:00:38.290
TALIESIN: Keep an eye out.
LAURA: Keep an eye out for traps.

1510
01:00:38.290 --> 01:00:39.780
TRAVIS: Are they at the edge of the clearing?

1511
01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:41.510
Like, it's them, it's the bodies

1512
01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:44.670
and then a larger clearing beyond them?

1513
01:00:44.670 --> 01:00:47.140
MATT: When I say it's a clearing,

1514
01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:48.170
it's a clearing by comparison

1515
01:00:48.170 --> 01:00:49.950
to how dense most of the area here is.

1516
01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:52.690
Maybe about 15, 20 or so feet right now

1517
01:00:52.690 --> 01:00:55.780
between the trees here to create this bowl

1518
01:00:55.780 --> 01:00:57.100
and you can see now as you get closer,

1519
01:00:57.100 --> 01:00:58.440
there are some stones set up like there

1520
01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:02.590
was once some sort of a small fire set up

1521
01:01:02.590 --> 01:01:06.510
that has since been completely put out.

1522
01:01:06.510 --> 01:01:09.300
Dirt and other bits of rock have been thrown in

1523
01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:11.730
to put out whatever embers there are

1524
01:01:11.730 --> 01:01:14.255
and as you get close, you can feel a little bit

1525
01:01:14.255 --> 01:01:18.707
of faint heat, so this fire was not too long ago.

1526
01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:22.430
TRAVIS: Are the tracks around here chaotic and spread out

1527
01:01:22.430 --> 01:01:24.230
as if there was a bit of a tango?

1528
01:01:25.570 --> 01:01:27.570
MATT: Make a perception check with a disadvantage

1529
01:01:27.570 --> 01:01:29.880
because it's getting dark.

1530
01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:32.230
LAURA: The Traveler loves you so much.

1531
01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:34.350
SAM: I'm going to go over and inspect

1532
01:01:34.350 --> 01:01:36.380
the bodies and look for traps around them.

1533
01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:37.970
MATT: Then make an investigation check.

1534
01:01:37.970 --> 01:01:40.020
LIAM: Globe goes out, (foomphing).

1535
01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:41.100
MATT: The area lights up a bit.

1536
01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:42.550
TRAVIS: 17.

1537
01:01:44.237 --> 01:01:45.360
MATT: And this was to look for tracks

1538
01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:46.870
about how chaotic it was around it?

1539
01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:49.080
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MATT: There was a bit of scuffle.

1540
01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:52.090
It doesn't look like there was an extended fight

1541
01:01:52.090 --> 01:01:53.630
but it looks like there was,

1542
01:01:56.020 --> 01:01:58.000
around and in the direction

1543
01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.720
of where that tree and where the bodies are,

1544
01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:01.220
there was some heavy movement.

1545
01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:05.160
Apparently, putting the pieces together,

1546
01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:07.360
you can imagine that

1547
01:02:09.410 --> 01:02:12.530
whoever these figures were, they were

1548
01:02:12.530 --> 01:02:15.510
set upon by those you track.

1549
01:02:16.490 --> 01:02:17.970
TRAVIS: Just because we're clocking those,

1550
01:02:17.970 --> 01:02:20.460
can I find the larger prints specifically

1551
01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:22.070
and see which direction they left in

1552
01:02:22.070 --> 01:02:24.060
and ask Nott to join me in keeping an eye out

1553
01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:25.450
on whatever direction that might be?

1554
01:02:25.450 --> 01:02:28.420
MATT: Yep, the direction changes a little bit from

1555
01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:30.420
the southwest direction that you were traveling

1556
01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:32.850
and actually heads a little slightly more south from

1557
01:02:32.850 --> 01:02:35.640
this point in time and that's where the tracks continue on.

1558
01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:37.490
TRAVIS: Can you help me keep an eye out?

1559
01:02:37.490 --> 01:02:39.300
SAM: I'm looking for traps right now, friend.

1560
01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:41.540
TRAVIS: Just to help me keep an eye out.

1561
01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:43.620
TALIESIN: Hey, anybody in the forest.

1562
01:02:44.770 --> 01:02:47.800
If this is some ambush or if anybody's coming up,

1563
01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:50.060
I would appreciate a little noise or something.

1564
01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:52.400
If you guys feel like just letting us know,

1565
01:02:53.405 --> 01:02:54.238
that'd be great.

1566
01:02:54.238 --> 01:02:56.000
MATT: Make a persuasion check.
TALIESIN: All right.

1567
01:02:59.210 --> 01:03:00.650
MARISHA: Persuade the swamp.

1568
01:03:00.650 --> 01:03:02.950
TALIESIN: Six.
MATT: Six, all right.

1569
01:03:02.950 --> 01:03:06.120
LAURA: That was a Guidance tap.

1570
01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:06.970
SAM: That's not going to do anything.

1571
01:03:06.970 --> 01:03:07.803
TALIESIN: Seven.

1572
01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:11.930
MATT: No traps, but looking through,

1573
01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:16.500
it looks like one of them was

1574
01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:17.810
slashed and impaled

1575
01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.410
and was thrown against the tree.

1576
01:03:21.410 --> 01:03:22.740
The tree above them, now

1577
01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:25.110
there's a little bit of a crack where the impact was

1578
01:03:25.110 --> 01:03:28.330
and a smear of blood where the body came to rest.

1579
01:03:28.330 --> 01:03:31.440
SAM: And were their pockets picked, or?

1580
01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:34.113
MATT: No, pockets unpicked.

1581
01:03:34.113 --> 01:03:35.820
SAM: Well, I'm going to get all their shit, of course.

1582
01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:38.980
LIAM: How long dead do these bodies seem upon inspection?

1583
01:03:38.980 --> 01:03:40.040
MATT: Make a medicine check.

1584
01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:40.960
LAURA: Can I help?

1585
01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:42.627
MATT: You may, yeah.

1586
01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:45.300
LAURA: Well, I have really good medicine-- okay.

1587
01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:46.790
LIAM: Do it. I rolled one.

1588
01:03:46.790 --> 01:03:48.480
So you roll.
MATT: Up to you guys.

1589
01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:51.450
LIAM: Mine was shit, so roll as well.

1590
01:03:51.450 --> 01:03:52.750
Nine for me.

1591
01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:53.583
SAM: <i>Nein</i>.

1592
01:03:55.330 --> 01:03:56.880
LIAM: Oh, it's cocked.
LAURA: It's cocked.

1593
01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:57.713
Unfortunately.

1594
01:03:58.610 --> 01:03:59.443
18.

1595
01:03:59.443 --> 01:04:00.276
MATT: Okay.

1596
01:04:00.276 --> 01:04:02.490
The bodies have been dead maybe

1597
01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:07.360
between six to three hours.

1598
01:04:09.512 --> 01:04:12.130
LAURA: Okay, we're a few hours behind them.

1599
01:04:12.130 --> 01:04:14.240
MARISHA: Looking through the pockets with Nott--

1600
01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:15.073
MATT: Yeah.

1601
01:04:15.073 --> 01:04:18.570
MARISHA: While she looks for valuables and goods,

1602
01:04:18.570 --> 01:04:19.680
I want to look for things like,

1603
01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:21.430
does it look like they were guides?

1604
01:04:21.430 --> 01:04:24.210
Does it look like they were rolling with these people?

1605
01:04:24.210 --> 01:04:27.620
MATT: Looking through equipment, you find a number of arrows,

1606
01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:31.020
a short bow on the halfling as well as pelts,

1607
01:04:32.490 --> 01:04:33.530
knives.

1608
01:04:33.530 --> 01:04:35.190
These were both hunters.

1609
01:04:35.190 --> 01:04:36.240
They're game hunters.

1610
01:04:38.766 --> 01:04:40.207
SAM: Wrong place, wrong time.
MARISHA: Casualties.

1611
01:04:40.207 --> 01:04:41.040
Okay.

1612
01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:43.130
MATT: They look they're dressed for stealth

1613
01:04:43.130 --> 01:04:44.210
and for traveling this terrain,

1614
01:04:44.210 --> 01:04:46.390
looks like they lived here and knew it well.

1615
01:04:47.535 --> 01:04:48.870
LAURA: They would have been really good guides.

1616
01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:49.703
MARISHA: Bummer.

1617
01:04:49.703 --> 01:04:50.700
LAURA: Maybe they know about ruins!

1618
01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:52.630
TALIESIN: They still can be.
LAURA: Can you talk to them?

1619
01:04:52.630 --> 01:04:53.900
TALIESIN: Yeah, I can talk to them.

1620
01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:55.370
TRAVIS: There's no ruins, remember?

1621
01:04:55.370 --> 01:04:57.405
LAURA: Well, maybe they know of something.

1622
01:04:57.405 --> 01:04:59.040
MARISHA: Yeah, where the heart is?

1623
01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:02.200
MATT: If you want, you can take the shortbow.

1624
01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:03.180
Two shortbows,

1625
01:05:05.070 --> 01:05:06.400
three daggers.

1626
01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:10.510
There's about 35 gold and

1627
01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:13.950
26 silver between the two of them

1628
01:05:13.950 --> 01:05:15.500
along with a handful of copper.

1629
01:05:16.463 --> 01:05:18.413
SAM: I take the gold, anything else shiny?

1630
01:05:19.369 --> 01:05:21.960
MATT: No, there's some charms and keepsakes.

1631
01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:24.120
There's some fashioned, carved bone pieces

1632
01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:25.700
that are made into small orbs

1633
01:05:25.700 --> 01:05:27.850
that are all tied together in this long leather tether

1634
01:05:27.850 --> 01:05:30.010
that hangs from the side of the armor.

1635
01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:34.150
Yeah, these are these people that travel

1636
01:05:34.150 --> 01:05:37.820
and seem to carry an element of their persona

1637
01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:40.860
and maybe the people they care about

1638
01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:42.210
with them as they travel through.

1639
01:05:42.210 --> 01:05:44.250
LIAM: So the sun is down.

1640
01:05:44.250 --> 01:05:46.370
How close are we pushing into exhaustion?

1641
01:05:47.692 --> 01:05:51.790
MATT: If you were to continue on without sleep tonight,

1642
01:05:51.790 --> 01:05:53.310
you would all gain a point of exhaustion.

1643
01:05:53.310 --> 01:05:54.143
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>..

1644
01:05:54.143 --> 01:05:55.400
TALIESIN: And have burned through a bunch of spells.

1645
01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:58.070
LIAM: So what time, yes, what time roughly is it?

1646
01:05:58.070 --> 01:06:00.644
Not roughly, precisely for Caleb?

1647
01:06:00.644 --> 01:06:01.960
Sorry, I picked the feat.

1648
01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:03.090
MATT: You did.

1649
01:06:03.090 --> 01:06:07.160
I'd say about now, it's close to 8:30-ish.

1650
01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:09.287
LIAM: That's not bad, not bad.

1651
01:06:09.287 --> 01:06:10.270
LAURA: I have a question.

1652
01:06:10.270 --> 01:06:13.330
Does anybody have a jewel or anything

1653
01:06:13.330 --> 01:06:14.740
that's worth like 50 gold?

1654
01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:18.000
Like a decently expensive one?

1655
01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:18.833
MARISHA: Yeah.
LIAM: I do.

1656
01:06:18.833 --> 01:06:19.890
SAM: I do.

1657
01:06:19.890 --> 01:06:22.840
LAURA: That you would be willing to let me borrow?

1658
01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:24.340
LIAM: Yeah, sure.
LAURA: To literally destroy?

1659
01:06:24.340 --> 01:06:27.370
SAM: Would you use it for a magic spell and dispel it forever?

1660
01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:31.510
LIAM: I have a spell that I never use anymore.

1661
01:06:31.510 --> 01:06:34.790
So you could have a diamond if you care for it.

1662
01:06:34.790 --> 01:06:36.860
MARISHA: I have this pearl necklace.

1663
01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:39.670
LAURA: I probably need one thing,

1664
01:06:39.670 --> 01:06:41.340
so if you're not going to--

1665
01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:45.490
MARISHA: I mean, pearls. You just need 50 gold, right?

1666
01:06:45.490 --> 01:06:46.323
LAURA: Yeah.

1667
01:06:46.323 --> 01:06:47.750
MARISHA: Maybe save the diamond and take the pearl

1668
01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:49.871
because pearls, right?

1669
01:06:49.871 --> 01:06:50.760
LIAM: I have one diamond.

1670
01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:52.240
MARISHA: No one gives a shit about pearls.

1671
01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:53.770
TRAVIS: Still 50 gold, so.

1672
01:06:53.770 --> 01:06:57.690
LIAM: It's a single gem,
and I have not used it since Felderwin.

1673
01:06:57.690 --> 01:06:59.120
Or thereabouts.

1674
01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:02.453
LAURA: If you don't mind, Caleb.

1675
01:07:02.453 --> 01:07:07.037
LIAM: Here you are.
LAURA: Thank you.

1676
01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:10.150
MARISHA: You don't use it, you just keep it.

1677
01:07:11.288 --> 01:07:12.824
TRAVIS: That'd be awesome.

1678
01:07:12.824 --> 01:07:13.657
MATT: It'd be pretty great.

1679
01:07:13.657 --> 01:07:14.490
LAURA: I'm not going to use it like,

1680
01:07:14.490 --> 01:07:15.390
I don't need it for a spell right now.

1681
01:07:15.390 --> 01:07:18.390
I need it for a spell a little bit later.

1682
01:07:18.390 --> 01:07:20.000
I have it prepared and then

1683
01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.720
I realized I can't actually do it.

1684
01:07:22.810 --> 01:07:24.450
LIAM: I trust you.

1685
01:07:24.450 --> 01:07:28.290
TALIESIN: Anybody have any questions they want to ask these guys?

1686
01:07:28.290 --> 01:07:30.240
SAM: We know when this happened, roughly.

1687
01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:31.670
We know which direction they went.

1688
01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:33.550
The only information we can get is--

1689
01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:35.500
MARISHA: Who it was.
SAM: We know who it was.

1690
01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:36.970
MARISHA: If they know where the heart is.

1691
01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:37.950
LAURA: Do they know where the heart is?

1692
01:07:37.950 --> 01:07:39.220
TRAVIS: Do they know what it is?

1693
01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:40.320
And it's the heart of--?

1694
01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:43.290
MARISHA: A demon.

1695
01:07:43.290 --> 01:07:44.810
Graz'zt?
TRAVIS: Tharizdun?

1696
01:07:47.845 --> 01:07:48.678
MARISHA: Jourrael.

1697
01:07:49.569 --> 01:07:51.403
LIAM: Caedogeist.
MARISHA: Caedogeist.

1698
01:07:51.403 --> 01:07:52.510
SAM: Ask if they know where this structure,

1699
01:07:52.510 --> 01:07:57.500
this natural structure is that we're trying to find.

1700
01:07:57.500 --> 01:07:59.042
LIAM: Yeah.

1701
01:07:59.042 --> 01:08:01.130
TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to cast Speak with Dead.

1702
01:08:02.460 --> 01:08:03.810
MATT: On which one?

1703
01:08:03.810 --> 01:08:06.110
SAM: Are we going to bed down here?

1704
01:08:06.110 --> 01:08:07.660
TALIESIN: Let's take the halfling.

1705
01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:08.817
MATT: Okay.

1706
01:08:12.135 --> 01:08:14.710
All right, so you take and arrange the body.

1707
01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:16.390
The face is now facing forward.

1708
01:08:18.460 --> 01:08:20.030
Prepare your ritual.

1709
01:08:20.030 --> 01:08:21.010
Close your eyes.

1710
01:08:21.010 --> 01:08:24.660
Focus on the Wildmother to breathe life once more

1711
01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:27.020
into this shell so that it may impart

1712
01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:28.770
its knowledge so it can be avenged.

1713
01:08:29.740 --> 01:08:33.230
As you open your eyes and let the bit of a prayer

1714
01:08:33.230 --> 01:08:36.250
escape your mouth, you can watch as the mist on the ground

1715
01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:39.210
that's been growing a little more dense

1716
01:08:39.210 --> 01:08:41.780
as the temperature drops closer to night

1717
01:08:41.780 --> 01:08:44.830
begins to swirl and become a funnel,

1718
01:08:44.830 --> 01:08:48.820
like a reverse, slow-moving tornado.

1719
01:08:48.820 --> 01:08:50.710
As it slowly curls upward,

1720
01:08:50.710 --> 01:08:54.550
it leans and then fills the mouth of the body.

1721
01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:58.460
And the bit of mist vanishes into its jaw

1722
01:08:58.460 --> 01:09:03.430
and then as the chest begins to puff up with air,

1723
01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:06.830
the eyes look towards you.

1724
01:09:12.610 --> 01:09:14.240
TALIESIN: The party that killed you,

1725
01:09:15.460 --> 01:09:17.410
we're searching for them to stop them.

1726
01:09:19.470 --> 01:09:22.230
They seek the heart of Jourrael,

1727
01:09:22.230 --> 01:09:25.270
the heart of a demon that is buried

1728
01:09:26.250 --> 01:09:28.080
somewhere to the south of us

1729
01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:30.450
or encased somewhere to the south of us.

1730
01:09:32.030 --> 01:09:33.880
Do you know where we would find this?

1731
01:09:38.030 --> 01:09:42.010
MATT: "I know not of the heart you speak of.

1732
01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:46.970
"Only what they asked us."

1733
01:09:48.690 --> 01:09:49.890
TALIESIN: What did they ask you?

1734
01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:57.950
MATT: "We were approached by a handsome man and a hooded woman.

1735
01:09:59.850 --> 01:10:01.210
"They requested

1736
01:10:02.970 --> 01:10:05.130
"knowledge of the Wraithroot tree.

1737
01:10:06.182 --> 01:10:08.740
TRAVIS: (whispering) The Wraithroot tree.

1738
01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:11.130
MATT: "We told them how to reach it

1739
01:10:11.130 --> 01:10:13.230
"but warned them of the curse inside,

1740
01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:15.840
"recommending they leave it be.

1741
01:10:18.533 --> 01:10:19.883
"And then we heard laughter.

1742
01:10:22.330 --> 01:10:23.163
"And that was all."

1743
01:10:23.163 --> 01:10:23.996
MARISHA: (groans)

1744
01:10:25.882 --> 01:10:28.305
LAURA: I got goosebumps, I got goosebumps!

1745
01:10:28.305 --> 01:10:29.758
TRAVIS: It got me on my chest.

1746
01:10:29.758 --> 01:10:30.591
It got me on my chest parts.

1747
01:10:30.591 --> 01:10:33.340
TALIESIN: What is the curse of the Wraithwood tree?

1748
01:10:33.340 --> 01:10:34.173
LIAM: Wraithroot.

1749
01:10:36.087 --> 01:10:37.945
MATT: "The Wraithroot sits at the center

1750
01:10:37.945 --> 01:10:39.994
"of the Mouldered Grove,

1751
01:10:41.980 --> 01:10:44.760
"a region of leafless deadwoods.

1752
01:10:46.710 --> 01:10:48.630
"Beware the bark that bites."

1753
01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:51.140
LAURA: The mark?

1754
01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:52.530
MATT: The bark that bites.

1755
01:10:52.530 --> 01:10:53.950
TRAVIS: Stay away from the fucking tree.

1756
01:10:53.950 --> 01:10:56.090
MARISHA: The Mouldered Grove?

1757
01:10:56.090 --> 01:10:57.140
MATT: The Mouldered Grove.

1758
01:10:58.912 --> 01:11:00.362
LAURA: Beware the bark that bites.

1759
01:11:01.450 --> 01:11:03.946
SAM: Its bark is worse than its bite.

1760
01:11:03.946 --> 01:11:06.448
(laughter)

1761
01:11:06.448 --> 01:11:07.281
MATT: Dead.

1762
01:11:09.062 --> 01:11:10.984
LIAM: It's barking and biting.

1763
01:11:10.984 --> 01:11:12.420
TRAVIS: (dead voice) Don't make jokes about it.

1764
01:11:12.420 --> 01:11:13.660
It will kill you.

1765
01:11:15.496 --> 01:11:17.020
MARISHA: (dead voice) It hates puns.

1766
01:11:18.542 --> 01:11:19.375
LIAM: Not like Pulp Fiction?

1767
01:11:20.476 --> 01:11:21.670
TRAVIS: Ketchup.

1768
01:11:21.670 --> 01:11:24.890
TALIESIN: How far away and in what direction is this tree?

1769
01:11:24.890 --> 01:11:26.040
How would we get there?

1770
01:11:28.490 --> 01:11:31.750
MATT: One of the arms, which is partially ruined--

1771
01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:34.090
it's the muscle tissue just exposed

1772
01:11:34.090 --> 01:11:37.410
and the bone open, the arm (creaking)

1773
01:11:39.069 --> 01:11:41.880
and points in a southward direction

1774
01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:43.330
from where you are currently.

1775
01:11:45.530 --> 01:11:46.800
"About a day's travel."

1776
01:11:48.536 --> 01:11:51.432
SAM: We should go all night.

1777
01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:53.153
TALIESIN: Last question.

1778
01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:57.260
We think we know possibly

1779
01:11:57.260 --> 01:11:59.050
how to protect ourselves from them

1780
01:11:59.050 --> 01:12:02.660
but is there anything you can say that would protect us?

1781
01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:06.420
Any advice to shield us from what we're about to face?

1782
01:12:06.420 --> 01:12:07.550
LAURA: Was that your fifth question?

1783
01:12:07.550 --> 01:12:08.450
TALIESIN: Mm hmm.
LAURA: Shit.

1784
01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:10.423
MATT: "Yes:

1785
01:12:11.290 --> 01:12:12.970
"don't go."

1786
01:12:12.970 --> 01:12:13.803
MARISHA: Yeah.

1787
01:12:14.860 --> 01:12:16.380
MATT: And the mist emerges from the mouth

1788
01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:18.550
and slowly spills down the front of the chest

1789
01:12:18.550 --> 01:12:21.910
and then merges with the rest of the surrounding fog.

1790
01:12:24.110 --> 01:12:26.860
LIAM: Okay, so we're doing this.

1791
01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:29.061
SAM: I mean, we have to keep going.

1792
01:12:29.061 --> 01:12:29.894
LAURA: Yeah.

1793
01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:33.340
We're less than a day behind them.

1794
01:12:33.340 --> 01:12:35.900
We're like three hours to six hours behind them.

1795
01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:37.760
And we could get ahead of them.

1796
01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:38.593
TALIESIN: And then what?

1797
01:12:39.530 --> 01:12:41.750
SAM: Ambush, stop them before they get there.

1798
01:12:41.750 --> 01:12:44.020
TALIESIN: With what spells?
SAM: At least watch them go in.

1799
01:12:44.020 --> 01:12:45.470
LAURA: I don't know how we would get ahead of them.

1800
01:12:45.470 --> 01:12:47.480
LIAM: How are you two doing?

1801
01:12:49.088 --> 01:12:50.030
LAURA: I'm almost out of everything.

1802
01:12:50.030 --> 01:12:51.830
TRAVIS: Could a short rest get you anything?

1803
01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:54.199
LAURA: No.

1804
01:12:54.199 --> 01:12:56.730
SAM: But we can get closer and then rest.

1805
01:12:56.730 --> 01:13:00.570
Or, you know, you spellcasters can take a nap

1806
01:13:00.570 --> 01:13:01.800
and we can keep on.

1807
01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:03.920
Some of us can keep on and find them.

1808
01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:04.970
MARISHA: Yeah, I feel great.

1809
01:13:06.506 --> 01:13:08.390
LAURA: Can you carry me while I sleep?

1810
01:13:08.390 --> 01:13:09.751
MARISHA: Okay.

1811
01:13:11.250 --> 01:13:12.760
TRAVIS: I would love to catch them as much as

1812
01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:15.240
the next person but if we get there and we're weak

1813
01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:18.580
and we're half at our best, it's for nothing.

1814
01:13:18.580 --> 01:13:20.230
LAURA: We're not going to fight them though, right?

1815
01:13:20.230 --> 01:13:21.710
We're not trying to fight them.

1816
01:13:21.710 --> 01:13:22.660
TRAVIS: If we have a say.

1817
01:13:25.337 --> 01:13:27.633
LAURA: I don't want to fight them.

1818
01:13:27.633 --> 01:13:29.490
TALIESIN: Are we strong enough to even run if we have to?

1819
01:13:29.490 --> 01:13:31.940
LIAM: I don't have the ability to take us out of here

1820
01:13:32.861 --> 01:13:34.400
in the way that we are accustomed to.

1821
01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:35.890
I have used all of my--

1822
01:13:35.890 --> 01:13:37.433
LAURA: Oh, god.

1823
01:13:37.433 --> 01:13:38.266
TALIESIN: So we couldn't even run if things went bad.

1824
01:13:38.266 --> 01:13:39.220
LAURA: Could you make a dome?

1825
01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:42.080
LIAM: If I had enough time, yeah,

1826
01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:43.930
or if I could do it in advance, yeah.

1827
01:13:44.910 --> 01:13:47.110
TRAVIS: I don't think that's part of this, though.

1828
01:13:47.110 --> 01:13:49.360
We'll come upon them quickly.

1829
01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:50.193
LIAM: It's unpredictable.

1830
01:13:50.193 --> 01:13:53.870
There's no way to control the situation like that.

1831
01:13:53.870 --> 01:13:56.058
TRAVIS: We should rest.
LAURA: We're walking.

1832
01:13:56.058 --> 01:13:57.110
SAM: The four of you can rest.

1833
01:13:57.110 --> 01:13:58.870
Me and Beau can go find them.

1834
01:13:58.870 --> 01:14:01.840
MARISHA: We could scout a little if we wanted, I guess.

1835
01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:03.510
LIAM: Miles ahead of us?

1836
01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:04.343
That's lunacy.

1837
01:14:05.871 --> 01:14:08.210
SAM: I don't know the meaning of the word.

1838
01:14:08.210 --> 01:14:09.043
Really, though.

1839
01:14:10.543 --> 01:14:12.059
LIAM: It's a bad idea.
TRAVIS: It has to do with the moon.

1840
01:14:12.059 --> 01:14:14.490
The "lun" that you'll "see."

1841
01:14:14.490 --> 01:14:19.490
TALIESIN: This forest is going to be very dangerous in the evening.

1842
01:14:19.975 --> 01:14:20.960
LAURA: Yeah.

1843
01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:22.850
SAM: Have you seen Beau's arms?

1844
01:14:22.850 --> 01:14:24.960
LIAM: Here's the thing.
TRAVIS: Or abs, for that matter.

1845
01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:27.080
TALIESIN: I've seen both of their arms.

1846
01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:28.500
LAURA: They are very healthily on display.

1847
01:14:28.500 --> 01:14:31.970
LIAM: This group of people have snapped away like that,

1848
01:14:31.970 --> 01:14:35.000
so if they get to their quarry, they're gone.

1849
01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.860
Most likely they are gone.

1850
01:14:36.860 --> 01:14:38.360
LAURA: Or they'll wake it up.

1851
01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:39.850
They probably need some time.

1852
01:14:39.850 --> 01:14:41.150
Maybe they'll do it right there.

1853
01:14:41.150 --> 01:14:45.950
SAM: If they get there tonight while we're snoozing,

1854
01:14:45.950 --> 01:14:48.090
they could be gone by the time we wake up.

1855
01:14:48.090 --> 01:14:48.950
LIAM: That's what I'm saying.

1856
01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:51.790
TRAVIS: Also, one last thing.

1857
01:14:52.990 --> 01:14:57.280
The last time Obann needed access to something,

1858
01:14:57.280 --> 01:14:59.060
he waited for us.

1859
01:14:59.060 --> 01:15:00.730
He needed us to open it.

1860
01:15:00.730 --> 01:15:02.770
LAURA: Yeah, but he doesn't know we're even around.

1861
01:15:02.770 --> 01:15:04.150
This time, he's got Yasha.

1862
01:15:05.250 --> 01:15:06.630
He needed Yasha.

1863
01:15:06.630 --> 01:15:07.530
MARISHA: He needed Yasha.

1864
01:15:09.025 --> 01:15:12.560
TRAVIS: Did he need Yasha to get in there?

1865
01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:13.900
MARISHA: I think he needed Yasha

1866
01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:15.510
for his overall piece of his puzzle.

1867
01:15:15.510 --> 01:15:16.970
LIAM: His overall plan.

1868
01:15:16.970 --> 01:15:18.430
But we don't know,

1869
01:15:18.430 --> 01:15:20.100
we don't know enough on what he's doing now.

1870
01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:21.620
TALIESIN: It's not like this is going to be an easy walk-up.

1871
01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:22.650
This is going to be,

1872
01:15:23.490 --> 01:15:26.370
I have a funny feeling that they're not going to,

1873
01:15:26.370 --> 01:15:28.540
I don't think they're going to waltz into this thing either.

1874
01:15:28.540 --> 01:15:30.679
LAURA: One powerful spell left.
TALIESIN: I think it's dangerous.

1875
01:15:30.679 --> 01:15:32.720
LAURA: I could scry again.

1876
01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:34.840
TALIESIN: I mean, only if we're going to sleep.

1877
01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:37.510
LAURA: But we've already done it once today, so maybe I can't.

1878
01:15:37.510 --> 01:15:40.110
TRAVIS: If you scry and they're moving instead of resting,

1879
01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:43.730
will that shape your thoughts at all?

1880
01:15:43.730 --> 01:15:44.750
LAURA: If they're resting?

1881
01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:47.200
SAM: If they're moving, we have to keep moving.

1882
01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:48.420
TRAVIS: Might as well scry, then.

1883
01:15:49.530 --> 01:15:50.990
SAM: (singing) You might as well scry.

1884
01:15:50.990 --> 01:15:53.602
MATT: Just so you know,

1885
01:15:53.602 --> 01:15:56.370
if a scry fails, it's resisted,

1886
01:15:56.370 --> 01:15:57.570
then they can't be scried on again

1887
01:15:57.570 --> 01:15:59.945
for 24 hours but if it succeeded,

1888
01:15:59.945 --> 01:16:02.095
there's no reason why you couldn't try it again.

1889
01:16:02.095 --> 01:16:04.920
TALIESIN: I'm actually going to

1890
01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:06.610
try and use Divine Intervention

1891
01:16:06.610 --> 01:16:09.580
to see if they're going to bed down for the night.

1892
01:16:09.580 --> 01:16:10.960
LAURA: Oh yeah, do that before.

1893
01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:12.670
MATT: You're going to attempt a Divine Intervention.

1894
01:16:12.670 --> 01:16:14.100
All right, go for it.
TRAVIS: Come on, baby.

1895
01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:15.170
SAM: Do demons sleep?

1896
01:16:15.170 --> 01:16:16.800
TALIESIN: Fuck no.

1897
01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:17.633
LIAM: Damn it!

1898
01:16:17.633 --> 01:16:18.950
LAURA: What do you have to get? How does it work?

1899
01:16:18.950 --> 01:16:20.470
TALIESIN: Under 10%.
MATT: You focus quietly

1900
01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:22.080
and take a deep breath

1901
01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:26.338
and as you do that, another fly (buzzing).

1902
01:16:26.338 --> 01:16:27.171
Chokes you up for a minute.

1903
01:16:27.171 --> 01:16:28.537
LAURA: So it's got to be the zero?

1904
01:16:28.537 --> 01:16:29.710
LIAM: No, Virginia, there is no Santa Claus.

1905
01:16:29.710 --> 01:16:31.360
TALIESIN: Or the 10 and the zero.

1906
01:16:32.801 --> 01:16:34.340
LAURA: Or a zero and anything.
TALIESIN: Or the zero, anything.

1907
01:16:35.479 --> 01:16:36.660
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to try it too.

1908
01:16:36.660 --> 01:16:37.790
LIAM: Come on.

1909
01:16:37.790 --> 01:16:38.812
MATT: So you're focused.

1910
01:16:38.812 --> 01:16:41.287
LAURA: Come on, Traveler!

1911
01:16:41.287 --> 01:16:42.120
MARISHA: Shake weight that roll!

1912
01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:43.329
LAURA: Nope.

1913
01:16:43.329 --> 01:16:44.680
LIAM: Damn it.

1914
01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:45.620
TALIESIN: And once you use it,

1915
01:16:45.620 --> 01:16:47.490
once it succeeds, you can't use it for a week.

1916
01:16:47.490 --> 01:16:49.540
LAURA: Okay, all right, I'm going to try to scry.

1917
01:16:50.430 --> 01:16:51.890
MATT: Okay.

1918
01:16:51.890 --> 01:16:54.550
So you stop here in the same area

1919
01:16:54.550 --> 01:16:55.560
where the bodies were found.

1920
01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:57.955
You haven't left from this spot.

1921
01:16:57.955 --> 01:16:58.820
Using the little clearing here,

1922
01:16:58.820 --> 01:17:01.370
you begin to set up your scrying ritual, you focus.

1923
01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:03.850
It takes about 10 minutes to cast.

1924
01:17:03.850 --> 01:17:05.220
You set up everything nervously.

1925
01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:07.080
It's getting colder and colder and as you sit down,

1926
01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:10.710
the mist is obfuscating about a foot or so of the ground.

1927
01:17:10.710 --> 01:17:12.550
As you're setting up, you're having to

1928
01:17:12.550 --> 01:17:14.160
shoo away the mist a bit and set it up

1929
01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:16.440
before it begins to filter back in.

1930
01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:19.030
You sit down. You guys watch as Jester,

1931
01:17:19.030 --> 01:17:20.910
you can only really see about her elbows up

1932
01:17:20.910 --> 01:17:22.980
as she sits in the middle of this mist

1933
01:17:22.980 --> 01:17:24.930
that's drifted around her.

1934
01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:29.070
Cold and really beautiful, as she closes her eyes,

1935
01:17:29.070 --> 01:17:30.730
and for a second you swear you see

1936
01:17:30.730 --> 01:17:33.820
the mist move around her

1937
01:17:33.820 --> 01:17:37.180
like something just shifted around her.

1938
01:17:37.180 --> 01:17:42.180
Makes you think for a moment.

1939
01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:51.450
It's cold and it's dark and in that moment,

1940
01:17:51.450 --> 01:17:53.180
there is that sense of desperation

1941
01:17:53.180 --> 01:17:55.180
and loneliness as you focus on the spell

1942
01:17:56.170 --> 01:18:01.150
and as the mist curls in around you like a cloak,

1943
01:18:02.030 --> 01:18:05.070
encircling you, you feel the Traveler

1944
01:18:05.070 --> 01:18:07.970
there once more and saying, "Not too far."

1945
01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:14.380
And suddenly, you feel your vision pulled as his hand

1946
01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:16.350
rests on your cheek and turns your head this way

1947
01:18:16.350 --> 01:18:18.440
and as your head turns this way, it's

1948
01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:20.330
like you're looking from one window into another

1949
01:18:20.330 --> 01:18:22.600
and as you look into this other pane of glass,

1950
01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:25.020
through it you can see in a familiar,

1951
01:18:25.020 --> 01:18:26.730
darkened wood like this,

1952
01:18:26.730 --> 01:18:27.563
in the shadows,

1953
01:18:29.260 --> 01:18:31.710
a very, very faint bit of crackling firelight.

1954
01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:39.360
You see in the space

1955
01:18:40.270 --> 01:18:44.480
a very, very low-lit fire in a center of stones

1956
01:18:45.770 --> 01:18:49.190
and sitting across it on two rotting logs

1957
01:18:49.190 --> 01:18:51.900
that have been lumped there, you can see Obann

1958
01:18:51.900 --> 01:18:56.900
in his true form, red demon skin, wings folded,

1959
01:18:57.460 --> 01:18:59.150
sitting there looking at the fire,

1960
01:18:59.150 --> 01:19:00.810
putting his hand in it

1961
01:19:00.810 --> 01:19:03.390
and letting it curl around his fingers

1962
01:19:03.390 --> 01:19:06.040
and Yasha just sitting there looking into the flames.

1963
01:19:09.070 --> 01:19:11.320
He reaches down and pulls up a bottle of wine

1964
01:19:12.242 --> 01:19:14.700
and takes a drink of it, looks to her.

1965
01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:19.130
"You may have some," and holds it out.

1966
01:19:19.970 --> 01:19:21.000
She reaches out without even looking

1967
01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:24.220
and takes it and drinks from the bottle and hands it back.

1968
01:19:24.220 --> 01:19:25.620
As he retrieves it, he says,

1969
01:19:27.620 --> 01:19:29.900
"You knew the seed of darkness within you only needed

1970
01:19:29.900 --> 01:19:32.650
"the right guide to germinate into something beautiful.

1971
01:19:35.610 --> 01:19:38.220
"Don't forget, you were the one to find me, Orphan Maker.

1972
01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:41.200
"For this, I will always be grateful

1973
01:19:42.270 --> 01:19:44.110
"and you will always be my favorite."

1974
01:19:45.135 --> 01:19:46.590
He glances around to the nearby wood

1975
01:19:46.590 --> 01:19:48.580
to see if maybe another heard him.

1976
01:19:52.130 --> 01:19:54.430
"We draw close to completing our found family.

1977
01:19:56.610 --> 01:19:58.430
"Becoming her will manifest,

1978
01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:01.530
"striking from the lightless realms

1979
01:20:01.530 --> 01:20:03.710
"and breaking her chains one by one.

1980
01:20:05.860 --> 01:20:09.690
"You remind me of her, a vision of her intent,

1981
01:20:10.610 --> 01:20:11.930
"walking towards destiny.

1982
01:20:13.650 --> 01:20:14.600
"I'm proud of you."

1983
01:20:15.462 --> 01:20:17.700
He reaches out to touch her chin.

1984
01:20:17.700 --> 01:20:18.533
SAM: Gross.

1985
01:20:19.450 --> 01:20:22.581
MATT: There's a small spark of blue lightning (crackling)

1986
01:20:22.581 --> 01:20:23.920
that sparks from under her chin to his hand

1987
01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:26.488
and he pulls back as she (grunts),

1988
01:20:26.488 --> 01:20:28.950
recoils a bit to one side.

1989
01:20:28.950 --> 01:20:32.020
You see him look at his fingers and look at her, furious.

1990
01:20:32.020 --> 01:20:34.180
In but a moment, his eyes glow orange

1991
01:20:34.180 --> 01:20:37.310
and you see behind her, from underneath the hair,

1992
01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:40.530
the orange glow emanates and she winces

1993
01:20:40.530 --> 01:20:44.000
for a second before her face going slack once more.

1994
01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.860
He now takes her chin in his hand without a fight

1995
01:20:48.860 --> 01:20:51.230
and looks her in the eyes and says,

1996
01:20:51.230 --> 01:20:53.640
"Stubborn as you may be, you are mine.

1997
01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:56.430
"You belong to her.

1998
01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:01.850
"Where we shall walk, no cloud or storm can touch us."

1999
01:21:03.550 --> 01:21:04.850
As he pulls his hand away,

2000
01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:10.682
you hear a (thudding)

2001
01:21:10.682 --> 01:21:13.620
and a slight little (low cackling).

2002
01:21:15.972 --> 01:21:17.410
He looks over his shoulder a bit.

2003
01:21:18.310 --> 01:21:19.510
"Keep a perimeter watch.

2004
01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:22.980
"Who knows what else is lingering in this forest,

2005
01:21:22.980 --> 01:21:26.427
"and we're so close, I can taste it."

2006
01:21:30.070 --> 01:21:33.120
And he sits down and starts drinking his wine a bit more

2007
01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:35.720
and they both just quietly look into the fire a bit longer

2008
01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:38.650
as the Laughing Hand begins to lumber off into the darkness.

2009
01:21:38.650 --> 01:21:39.650
LAURA: Oh, god.

2010
01:21:39.650 --> 01:21:42.360
Was the satchel still on his waist?

2011
01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:43.930
Did it look like--
MATT: Make a perception check.

2012
01:21:43.930 --> 01:21:46.270
MARISHA: Come on, come on, this is key, this is key.

2013
01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:49.430
MATT: With disadvantage because it is--

2014
01:21:49.430 --> 01:21:50.850
well, you have darkvision, don't you?

2015
01:21:50.850 --> 01:21:52.350
Yeah, so you're fine.
LAURA: Okay.

2016
01:21:54.771 --> 01:21:57.953
Goddamn it, perception.

2017
01:22:00.150 --> 01:22:02.710
14.
MATT: 14?

2018
01:22:02.710 --> 01:22:04.900
Within the fire, it wasn't some very terribly

2019
01:22:04.900 --> 01:22:07.590
hidden thing he was trying to keep from anybody.

2020
01:22:07.590 --> 01:22:09.250
Yeah, it was still hanging from his belt.

2021
01:22:09.250 --> 01:22:10.083
LAURA: Okay.

2022
01:22:11.140 --> 01:22:12.920
MARISHA: Oh, shit.

2023
01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:14.530
Come on, that's it.

2024
01:22:14.530 --> 01:22:16.350
TRAVIS: Does she relay all of that?

2025
01:22:16.350 --> 01:22:17.183
LAURA: All of it.

2026
01:22:18.170 --> 01:22:20.840
All of it, everything. I like to imagine as I'm scrying,

2027
01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:22.510
if I'm hearing anything, I'm just repeating

2028
01:22:22.510 --> 01:22:24.910
what I'm hearing like out loud, yeah.

2029
01:22:26.220 --> 01:22:27.720
SAM: Well, clearly Yasha

2030
01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:30.900
is definitely evil and not under the control of anything.

2031
01:22:30.900 --> 01:22:32.150
TRAVIS: That's my assertion as well.

2032
01:22:33.410 --> 01:22:35.210
SAM: We have to keep going.
LAURA: Poor Yasha.

2033
01:22:36.940 --> 01:22:38.660
SAM: They're close.

2034
01:22:38.660 --> 01:22:40.070
LIAM: With what intention? Are we trying

2035
01:22:40.070 --> 01:22:41.820
to get close enough to have you--

2036
01:22:41.820 --> 01:22:43.370
LAURA: Sneak in.
LIAM: Invisible?

2037
01:22:43.370 --> 01:22:44.240
LAURA: Get the skull.

2038
01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:46.530
LIAM: Grabbing the sack is one option.

2039
01:22:46.530 --> 01:22:49.993
SAM: I will take a drink right now.

2040
01:22:49.993 --> 01:22:51.480
That was scary.

2041
01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:53.830
MARISHA: It looks like the Laughing Hand roams free.

2042
01:22:53.830 --> 01:22:55.230
He runs patrol.

2043
01:22:55.230 --> 01:22:56.430
We don't need to--

2044
01:22:56.430 --> 01:22:58.410
LIAM: Probably he does not need to sleep.

2045
01:22:58.410 --> 01:23:00.580
MARISHA: He doesn't need to sleep.
LAURA: He's insane already.

2046
01:23:00.580 --> 01:23:01.972
MARISHA: He might be wandering.

2047
01:23:01.972 --> 01:23:04.280
Who knows how much ground he covers

2048
01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:07.741
in the middle of the night but maybe stalking him,

2049
01:23:07.741 --> 01:23:09.000
trying to attack him when

2050
01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:12.010
he's far enough away from the camp.

2051
01:23:12.010 --> 01:23:14.590
Not attacking him.
SAM: The one that can't die?

2052
01:23:14.590 --> 01:23:17.250
MARISHA: We just got to get this skull though, like you said.

2053
01:23:17.250 --> 01:23:19.600
TRAVIS: And if he is just walking a perimeter,

2054
01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:21.180
there are openings in that perimeter.

2055
01:23:21.180 --> 01:23:22.013
LAURA: Yeah.

2056
01:23:22.990 --> 01:23:24.300
LIAM: If he's the only one.

2057
01:23:24.300 --> 01:23:27.170
TRAVIS: You just have to be the most silent

2058
01:23:27.170 --> 01:23:30.053
and unseen you've ever been.

2059
01:23:30.053 --> 01:23:32.130
TALIESIN: We have no spells to help you.
LAURA: Nothing.

2060
01:23:32.130 --> 01:23:34.830
SAM: I got this.

2061
01:23:34.830 --> 01:23:36.180
MARISHA: I'm going with you.

2062
01:23:36.180 --> 01:23:37.013
LAURA: What?

2063
01:23:37.013 --> 01:23:38.500
TALIESIN: I think this is a terrible idea.

2064
01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:40.280
TRAVIS: I do as well.
LIAM: No, no, no, no.

2065
01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:43.683
Let's think this out first.

2066
01:23:43.683 --> 01:23:45.543
SAM: We can create a distraction.

2067
01:23:45.543 --> 01:23:47.330
LAURA: No distractions, no nothing.

2068
01:23:47.330 --> 01:23:49.270
No nothing, we make no noise.

2069
01:23:49.270 --> 01:23:51.640
If you make noise, the Laughing Hand will be alerted

2070
01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:53.330
and then everything goes to shit.

2071
01:23:53.330 --> 01:23:55.720
You have to know where he's going and sneak in

2072
01:23:55.720 --> 01:23:58.450
in the big hole in his perimeter and go in

2073
01:23:58.450 --> 01:24:01.030
and steal the thing and then run back out immediately.

2074
01:24:01.030 --> 01:24:02.830
MARISHA: I think she's right.

2075
01:24:02.830 --> 01:24:04.900
TALIESIN: If there's not some sort of,

2076
01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:07.300
magic spell on the bag itself

2077
01:24:07.300 --> 01:24:09.820
that won't alert him to being disturbed immediately,

2078
01:24:09.820 --> 01:24:10.850
the way we used to do.

2079
01:24:10.850 --> 01:24:11.850
MARISHA: Well, and it might.

2080
01:24:11.850 --> 01:24:14.360
In which case, I think we all need to be nearby,

2081
01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:16.370
but I think Jester's right.

2082
01:24:16.370 --> 01:24:17.990
I think maybe this is going to take a little bit

2083
01:24:17.990 --> 01:24:20.790
of observation and watching the Laughing Hand and watching

2084
01:24:20.790 --> 01:24:25.790
its path and seeing if it is a specific patrol path.

2085
01:24:25.798 --> 01:24:27.980
TALIESIN: We're down so much right now.

2086
01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:31.440
TRAVIS: Yeah, okay, so, we all know the option of letting Nott

2087
01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:35.260
somehow go in unseen, undetected and pulling hopefully

2088
01:24:35.260 --> 01:24:37.370
the object off of his hip and retreating.

2089
01:24:37.370 --> 01:24:40.460
However, even if they are close,

2090
01:24:40.460 --> 01:24:41.720
they still have to get to the tree

2091
01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:43.830
that seems to have a fucking curse on it

2092
01:24:43.830 --> 01:24:46.230
and it might slow them down a bit.

2093
01:24:46.230 --> 01:24:48.970
If Nott is detected, we're going to try

2094
01:24:48.970 --> 01:24:52.070
and rally to her in her half state, if not worse.

2095
01:24:53.580 --> 01:24:55.670
We could just follow them and try

2096
01:24:55.670 --> 01:24:58.130
and catch up with them tomorrow after a rest,

2097
01:24:58.130 --> 01:25:00.100
when we're all in our best form.

2098
01:25:00.100 --> 01:25:01.000
LAURA: And then what?

2099
01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.440
LIAM: If we do that, and I'm not saying we don't, Fjord,

2100
01:25:03.440 --> 01:25:07.730
but if we do that, we run the risk potentially of this

2101
01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:11.660
extra being, this Caedogeist,

2102
01:25:11.660 --> 01:25:14.220
from joining them.

2103
01:25:14.220 --> 01:25:17.400
So I'm not saying no, I'm just putting that on the table.

2104
01:25:19.730 --> 01:25:21.885
SAM: One more option.
TALIESIN: Yeah?

2105
01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:25.100
SAM: I'm supremely confident in my abilities,

2106
01:25:25.100 --> 01:25:28.340
especially if I have a few more gulps of booze,

2107
01:25:28.340 --> 01:25:31.452
but we could continue on tonight.

2108
01:25:31.452 --> 01:25:34.023
And get there.
MARISHA: And get there first,

2109
01:25:34.023 --> 01:25:37.950
and try and get to the heart first.

2110
01:25:37.950 --> 01:25:40.450
TRAVIS: We will take on the cursed tree in a half state.

2111
01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:42.800
MARISHA: So that's the thing.

2112
01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:44.700
SAM: We just don't have to touch the bark that bites.

2113
01:25:44.700 --> 01:25:47.090
TRAVIS: Allowing them to catch up to us.

2114
01:25:47.090 --> 01:25:48.100
SAM: Tomorrow morning.

2115
01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:49.560
MARISHA: Here's our three options that

2116
01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:52.850
I think that I have, that we've laid out.

2117
01:25:53.810 --> 01:25:54.643
Right?

2118
01:25:54.643 --> 01:25:56.203
TRAVIS: (cackling)

2119
01:25:56.203 --> 01:25:58.730
MARISHA: Hang on, because there's pros and cons to both.

2120
01:25:58.730 --> 01:26:00.500
There's pros and cons to both.

2121
01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:02.440
MATT: I love this game so much.

2122
01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:03.690
SAM: There's one more option.

2123
01:26:03.690 --> 01:26:05.060
MARISHA: Wait, what do you mean? There's a fourth?

2124
01:26:05.060 --> 01:26:06.860
What's your fourth?
LIAM: We'll talk it out.

2125
01:26:06.860 --> 01:26:09.529
SAM: We call Essek here and Essek comes back.

2126
01:26:09.529 --> 01:26:13.580
(laughter)

2127
01:26:13.580 --> 01:26:16.350
TRAVIS: I sensed ye had more to give, I think.

2128
01:26:16.350 --> 01:26:17.814
MARISHA: Yeah.

2129
01:26:17.814 --> 01:26:18.647
MATT: He has this little red bead.

2130
01:26:18.647 --> 01:26:20.050
He's like, "Here, hug this" and it's

2131
01:26:20.050 --> 01:26:22.400
a Delayed Blast Fireball that wipes you all out.

2132
01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:23.233
LIAM: I like this, I like this.

2133
01:26:23.233 --> 01:26:27.000
I think the idea of getting there before them and securing

2134
01:26:28.907 --> 01:26:31.450
their goal before them is probably

2135
01:26:31.450 --> 01:26:33.310
less of a challenge than them all together,

2136
01:26:33.310 --> 01:26:35.640
especially with this one woken up.

2137
01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:37.290
I can fly three of us there.

2138
01:26:37.290 --> 01:26:40.020
You can, can you fly right now?

2139
01:26:40.020 --> 01:26:41.570
SAM: Fly, he can fly?

2140
01:26:41.570 --> 01:26:43.810
LAURA: I can fly.
SAM: Oh, oh, he can fly!

2141
01:26:43.810 --> 01:26:45.240
LIAM: And you can carry.

2142
01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:48.240
And I can make some of us fly now.

2143
01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:49.420
I know how to do that.

2144
01:26:49.420 --> 01:26:50.650
LAURA: But it will literally,

2145
01:26:50.650 --> 01:26:52.860
I will have just some 1st-levels left.

2146
01:26:52.860 --> 01:26:54.900
I will have one 4th-level and--

2147
01:26:54.900 --> 01:26:56.983
I've got some shit.

2148
01:26:56.983 --> 01:27:00.280
LIAM: But it won't be dealing with our friend Yasha

2149
01:27:01.130 --> 01:27:05.047
and this Laughing Hand and Redman from Wu-Tang.

2150
01:27:06.248 --> 01:27:10.400
TRAVIS: Did you say Wu-Tang?

2151
01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:13.250
I heard "from Wu-Tang" and I just wanted to know

2152
01:27:13.250 --> 01:27:16.460
if the RZA or if anyone else were joining us.

2153
01:27:16.460 --> 01:27:18.280
TALIESIN: We need a long rest if this is what we're getting into.

2154
01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:19.950
TRAVIS: I could use some sixes on the sword.

2155
01:27:19.950 --> 01:27:23.540
MARISHA: Honestly, I am down to bring the motherfucking ruckus.

2156
01:27:23.540 --> 01:27:26.130
If we want to do this--

2157
01:27:26.130 --> 01:27:28.310
LIAM: I like getting there.

2158
01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:29.550
I am voting for grabbing

2159
01:27:29.550 --> 01:27:31.200
their prey out from under them right now.

2160
01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:32.520
LAURA: I like that plan.

2161
01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:33.720
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait.

2162
01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:35.580
You said one plan that you liked and then--

2163
01:27:35.580 --> 01:27:37.760
MARISHA: I understand, what I prefer

2164
01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:39.790
is getting there before them while they rest.

2165
01:27:39.790 --> 01:27:41.492
LAURA: Go for the heart.
LIAM: <i>Yeah</i>, right now.

2166
01:27:41.492 --> 01:27:42.504
SAM: Okay.

2167
01:27:42.504 --> 01:27:46.960
I love you Caleb, and I always agree with you but

2168
01:27:48.940 --> 01:27:50.920
If we go there and get the heart,

2169
01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:53.410
they're three to six hours ahead of us now.

2170
01:27:53.410 --> 01:27:55.430
They're going to sleep for--

2171
01:27:55.430 --> 01:27:57.070
LAURA: Eight hours.
SAM: Eight hours, right?

2172
01:27:57.070 --> 01:27:59.010
So we have to make up the up

2173
01:27:59.010 --> 01:28:00.970
to six hours that we've already--

2174
01:28:00.970 --> 01:28:03.160
LAURA: But we'll be flying.
LIAM: In flight.

2175
01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:06.110
SAM: And then keep going and acquire the thing.

2176
01:28:06.110 --> 01:28:07.468
Now they're going to wake up and start

2177
01:28:07.468 --> 01:28:08.818
making their way to us

2178
01:28:08.818 --> 01:28:10.970
and once we acquire the thing and we walk

2179
01:28:10.970 --> 01:28:12.590
out the door and they're standing right there--

2180
01:28:12.590 --> 01:28:14.860
TALIESIN: There's not going to be a door.
SAM: We have nothing left.

2181
01:28:14.860 --> 01:28:17.110
No escape, no spells, no nothing.

2182
01:28:17.110 --> 01:28:18.470
LIAM: Excuse me, though.

2183
01:28:18.470 --> 01:28:22.150
If we allow me to rest for an hour right now,

2184
01:28:22.150 --> 01:28:24.360
I could take us out of this place for good.

2185
01:28:25.340 --> 01:28:27.610
I am tapped in that respect.

2186
01:28:27.610 --> 01:28:29.810
But if we rest for an hour, I can do that.

2187
01:28:29.810 --> 01:28:31.800
And then we fly the rest of the way,

2188
01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:34.090
grab what they want and and we're gone.

2189
01:28:34.090 --> 01:28:35.340
And they lose the ability
TRAVIS: How long do you need

2190
01:28:35.340 --> 01:28:39.050
to prepare that button, the (squeaks) button, one minute?

2191
01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:43.450
LIAM: Let me verify so I'm not--

2192
01:28:43.450 --> 01:28:45.960
As a ritual though, it would be 11 minutes.

2193
01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:47.890
If it's one minute.
MATT: For a Teleportation Circle?

2194
01:28:48.791 --> 01:28:49.624
Is that what you're thinking?

2195
01:28:49.624 --> 01:28:52.280
LIAM: I'm thinking of various spells at one time.

2196
01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:54.390
One minute normally, so as a ritual.

2197
01:28:54.390 --> 01:28:56.900
Oh, no, if I rest, sorry.

2198
01:28:56.900 --> 01:28:58.423
If I rest I could do it in one minute.

2199
01:28:58.423 --> 01:29:00.445
LAURA: Do it as a ritual without the rest.

2200
01:29:00.445 --> 01:29:01.324
MATT: Well, I don't know.

2201
01:29:01.324 --> 01:29:03.560
Can Teleportation Circle be done as a ritual?

2202
01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:05.730
LIAM: I'm thinking of Leomund's Tiny Hut.

2203
01:29:12.963 --> 01:29:14.490
It's one minute if I have it, so I need

2204
01:29:14.490 --> 01:29:17.180
to rest an hour to be able to do it in one minute.

2205
01:29:17.180 --> 01:29:18.050
LAURA: Okay.
TALIESIN: That's a good,

2206
01:29:18.050 --> 01:29:19.510
that's the closest thing to a good plan.

2207
01:29:19.510 --> 01:29:22.440
LIAM: Rest for an hour, we turn into flying things.

2208
01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:23.950
We fly

2209
01:29:23.950 --> 01:29:27.610
around them and then try to what?

2210
01:29:27.610 --> 01:29:29.280
Fly down and find it?

2211
01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:33.070
We don't, but we know we're looking for a tree or something.

2212
01:29:33.070 --> 01:29:36.020
LIAM: We are looking for a remarkable tree to the south.

2213
01:29:36.020 --> 01:29:36.860
LAURA: In the dark.

2214
01:29:36.860 --> 01:29:37.910
TALIESIN: One normal day's travel.

2215
01:29:37.910 --> 01:29:39.810
LIAM: Beauregard and Nott will fly on you.

2216
01:29:39.810 --> 01:29:42.230
Fjord, Caduceus and I will just fly

2217
01:29:42.230 --> 01:29:44.030
and we will get there ahead of them.

2218
01:29:46.150 --> 01:29:47.830
MARISHA: All right, let's work out our options.

2219
01:29:47.830 --> 01:29:49.690
I really want to talk out talk out our options.

2220
01:29:49.690 --> 01:29:51.150
TRAVIS: I think we know what the options are.

2221
01:29:51.150 --> 01:29:53.100
MARISHA: So we have option one.

2222
01:29:53.100 --> 01:29:55.840
LIAM: Tell me what we're doing in an hour I'll start meditating.

2223
01:29:55.840 --> 01:29:57.060
LAURA: Yeah, that's cool.

2224
01:29:57.060 --> 01:29:59.600
MARISHA: Option one, we sleep now.

2225
01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:04.630
We know we're full and healthy and rested.

2226
01:30:04.630 --> 01:30:07.640
but maybe face them also full and rested.

2227
01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:09.760
LAURA: Or we don't face them at all, they get ahead of us.

2228
01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:11.960
MARISHA: And they find it and they're gone and they leave.

2229
01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:12.950
SAM: Lots of downsides.

2230
01:30:12.950 --> 01:30:16.540
MARISHA: A lot of downsides to that one but our casters are rested.

2231
01:30:16.540 --> 01:30:20.890
Number two, Nott and I do a little recon mission.

2232
01:30:20.890 --> 01:30:24.820
We head to the woods, we watch the patrol of this guy,

2233
01:30:24.820 --> 01:30:25.960
this Laughing Hand.

2234
01:30:26.930 --> 01:30:28.350
SAM: We get in, we get out.

2235
01:30:28.350 --> 01:30:29.640
MARISHA: Super general on this one.

2236
01:30:29.640 --> 01:30:31.463
Search, get in, get out, surgical.

2237
01:30:31.463 --> 01:30:32.980
TRAVIS: We're assuming the demon sleeps?

2238
01:30:32.980 --> 01:30:33.930
TALIESIN: Which it doesn't.

2239
01:30:34.938 --> 01:30:37.040
MARISHA: No, no, I think we just, no, I'm not fucking

2240
01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:38.590
assuming anyone sleeps.
TRAVIS: Yeah, that changes it.

2241
01:30:38.590 --> 01:30:41.010
If the demon sleeps, better plan.

2242
01:30:41.010 --> 01:30:43.340
If he's awake and just sipping fucking Merlot,

2243
01:30:43.340 --> 01:30:44.690
it's not so great.
TALIESIN: Assuming that they also

2244
01:30:44.690 --> 01:30:46.390
don't do anything to protect themselves.

2245
01:30:46.390 --> 01:30:49.180
MARISHA: No, I'm just hoping the demon never finds out.

2246
01:30:49.180 --> 01:30:51.690
But that's also like a hope and not a promise.

2247
01:30:51.690 --> 01:30:52.960
It's a lot of hopes.

2248
01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:55.470
So there's a lot of hopes to that one and that one.

2249
01:30:55.470 --> 01:30:56.830
LAURA: Third option, do what Caleb said.

2250
01:30:56.830 --> 01:30:58.940
MARISHA: Third option, we go now.

2251
01:30:58.940 --> 01:31:00.530
We don't sleep.

2252
01:31:00.530 --> 01:31:01.880
TALIESIN: They don't know they're even being followed.

2253
01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:04.630
MARISHA: Get out and deal with the cursed tree and probably

2254
01:31:04.630 --> 01:31:09.630
some like creepy shit and maybe bad guys

2255
01:31:09.793 --> 01:31:11.670
in the middle of the night at this cursed tree.

2256
01:31:11.670 --> 01:31:15.550
LAURA: I think that's the only option we can do, though.

2257
01:31:15.550 --> 01:31:17.660
TRAVIS: The first option is far safer

2258
01:31:17.660 --> 01:31:19.810
with less risk to all of us, yes.

2259
01:31:19.810 --> 01:31:20.643
LAURA: But--

2260
01:31:20.643 --> 01:31:22.180
MARISHA: Higher risk of failure.

2261
01:31:22.180 --> 01:31:24.640
LAURA: The goal of the whole reason we fucking came here.

2262
01:31:24.640 --> 01:31:25.900
TRAVIS: But yeah, just so we're

2263
01:31:25.900 --> 01:31:27.940
saying it out loud, failure is what?

2264
01:31:27.940 --> 01:31:30.520
They get what they came for and they bring back something

2265
01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:33.140
that what, we've decided is our mission to prevent?

2266
01:31:33.140 --> 01:31:34.000
LAURA: They're four people.

2267
01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:35.590
TRAVIS: I know, I'm just saying it out loud, right?

2268
01:31:35.590 --> 01:31:37.070
Because we could all die trying

2269
01:31:37.070 --> 01:31:39.463
to prevent this one thing instead of--

2270
01:31:39.463 --> 01:31:41.220
MARISHA: Losing our best friend?
TRAVIS: Doing something that's safe,

2271
01:31:41.220 --> 01:31:42.720
maybe losing it, being stronger,

2272
01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:44.380
coming back with more allies.

2273
01:31:44.380 --> 01:31:45.830
LAURA: We won't die.
TRAVIS: Living to fight another day.

2274
01:31:45.830 --> 01:31:47.790
I'm just saying.

2275
01:31:47.790 --> 01:31:48.740
LIAM: Still meditating.

2276
01:31:49.820 --> 01:31:51.670
LAURA: Caleb will be able to bamf us out.

2277
01:31:53.020 --> 01:31:57.910
Also, I'll make sure I have at least one Revivify

2278
01:31:57.910 --> 01:32:02.310
so that if one of us goes down, then I can, you know.

2279
01:32:02.310 --> 01:32:03.510
TALIESIN: To be fair, also,

2280
01:32:05.630 --> 01:32:08.070
yeah, I mean there's not a lot of,

2281
01:32:08.070 --> 01:32:10.655
I've got a little bit of healing.

2282
01:32:10.655 --> 01:32:11.690
It's not a lot I can do.

2283
01:32:11.690 --> 01:32:13.020
LAURA: I've some 1st-levels.

2284
01:32:13.020 --> 01:32:15.170
TRAVIS: To be fair, there's not a lot you can do.

2285
01:32:16.250 --> 01:32:19.470
SAM: If we go, if we fly, if we get to the Wraithroot,

2286
01:32:20.420 --> 01:32:22.291
the Rufus Wainwright tree.

2287
01:32:22.291 --> 01:32:24.408
(laughter)

2288
01:32:24.408 --> 01:32:25.241
TALIESIN: Yeah, you would.

2289
01:32:25.241 --> 01:32:27.940
SAM: We find the object, we get it.

2290
01:32:27.940 --> 01:32:28.773
TALIESIN: Bamf out.

2291
01:32:28.773 --> 01:32:31.320
SAM: do <i>not</i> get Yasha in that scenario.

2292
01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:33.870
LAURA: No, we save her for another day.

2293
01:32:33.870 --> 01:32:35.611
TALIESIN: We get not Yasha later,

2294
01:32:35.611 --> 01:32:37.170
when we're better prepared.

2295
01:32:37.170 --> 01:32:38.930
MARISHA: I appreciate Caleb's sentiment

2296
01:32:38.930 --> 01:32:40.400
and I'm going to say this comfortably because

2297
01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:42.640
he can't hear me because he's deep in meditation.

2298
01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:45.620
I think Yasha, trying to scoop her out, is a bad plan.

2299
01:32:45.620 --> 01:32:46.920
TALIESIN: I think it's a bad plan.
TRAVIS: Agreed.

2300
01:32:46.920 --> 01:32:49.966
I think he can hear everything you're saying.

2301
01:32:49.966 --> 01:32:51.960
MARISHA: Like subconsciously, yeah.

2302
01:32:51.960 --> 01:32:53.430
SAM: He can't hear a word we're saying.

2303
01:32:53.430 --> 01:32:54.951
Here, watch this.

2304
01:32:54.951 --> 01:32:56.078
(yelling) Caleb, you're a fucking--

2305
01:32:56.078 --> 01:32:58.380
TALIESIN: Shh.
SAM: Oh, sorry.

2306
01:32:59.930 --> 01:33:02.020
TRAVIS: What, are you jerking off a giant tree root?

2307
01:33:02.020 --> 01:33:03.210
What is that?

2308
01:33:03.210 --> 01:33:05.255
LIAM: Unlike poor Nott, I can multitask.

2309
01:33:05.255 --> 01:33:07.505
(laughter)

2310
01:33:09.615 --> 01:33:12.040
TALIESIN: I like the plan of going in and trying to get,

2311
01:33:12.040 --> 01:33:13.710
because they don't know that we're following them.

2312
01:33:13.710 --> 01:33:14.770
LAURA: They don't know we're here.

2313
01:33:14.770 --> 01:33:16.160
TALIESIN: They don't know that they need to rush.

2314
01:33:16.160 --> 01:33:17.270
They're going to take their time.

2315
01:33:17.270 --> 01:33:20.040
They're going to move at a reasonable pace.

2316
01:33:20.040 --> 01:33:21.500
LAURA: They're going to sleep.

2317
01:33:21.500 --> 01:33:23.510
TALIESIN: They're not in a rush.
TRAVIS: They don't sleep.

2318
01:33:23.510 --> 01:33:25.082
LAURA: Well, Yasha might need to sleep.

2319
01:33:25.082 --> 01:33:27.370
TRAVIS: We move at first light.
LAURA: Maybe that's why.

2320
01:33:27.370 --> 01:33:28.270
SAM: No...

2321
01:33:28.270 --> 01:33:32.003
sleep 'til Rufus Wainwright!

2322
01:33:33.445 --> 01:33:34.645
TALIESIN: But if we roll in now,

2323
01:33:36.830 --> 01:33:38.420
we roll in now, teleport out.

2324
01:33:38.420 --> 01:33:40.710
TRAVIS: I mean, it is certainly more of the adventure

2325
01:33:40.710 --> 01:33:41.690
what we're talking about.

2326
01:33:41.690 --> 01:33:45.080
TALIESIN: And then immediately get that skull into the--

2327
01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:46.350
LAURA: The heart.

2328
01:33:46.350 --> 01:33:48.008
TRAVIS: Long as we're all in agreement.

2329
01:33:48.008 --> 01:33:49.150
We are at great risk--

2330
01:33:49.150 --> 01:33:50.250
TALIESIN: Heart in the bag.

2331
01:33:50.250 --> 01:33:52.240
TRAVIS: Going forward instead of resting.

2332
01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:53.073
LAURA: Yes.

2333
01:33:53.073 --> 01:33:55.110
TRAVIS: And not being able to do this at a day.

2334
01:33:56.170 --> 01:33:58.570
LAURA: I don't see that as a real option, though.

2335
01:33:58.570 --> 01:33:59.660
MARISHA: I agree.

2336
01:33:59.660 --> 01:34:02.515
I think we technically have two options.

2337
01:34:03.590 --> 01:34:06.790
Either getting the case off of the Laughing Hand

2338
01:34:06.790 --> 01:34:08.750
or going ahead and getting the heart.

2339
01:34:08.750 --> 01:34:09.970
I don't think resting is an option.

2340
01:34:09.970 --> 01:34:13.450
TRAVIS: All right, then let's do it.

2341
01:34:13.450 --> 01:34:15.760
TALIESIN: How are you feeling? Are you all right?

2342
01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:18.250
TRAVIS: I will not abandon this group,

2343
01:34:18.250 --> 01:34:21.530
but I do feel like it's quite the risk.

2344
01:34:21.530 --> 01:34:23.480
SAM: He has ulcers.

2345
01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:26.110
TALIESIN: I'll also say that we're not exhausted yet.

2346
01:34:26.110 --> 01:34:28.510
I mean, we won't be exhausted 'til daylight.

2347
01:34:28.510 --> 01:34:29.343
LAURA: Tomorrow.

2348
01:34:31.234 --> 01:34:33.090
LIAM: If we pushed into the night, hopefully the flight--

2349
01:34:33.090 --> 01:34:35.330
I'm meditating.
LAURA: It's, like, 9:30 right now.

2350
01:34:35.330 --> 01:34:37.880
We can go until at least like--

2351
01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:38.740
TRAVIS: Then let's do this.

2352
01:34:38.740 --> 01:34:40.460
LIAM: I have partied 'til three before.
SAM: Yeah!

2353
01:34:40.460 --> 01:34:41.410
TRAVIS: Decided?

2354
01:34:41.410 --> 01:34:42.570
SAM: Decided!

2355
01:34:42.570 --> 01:34:43.403
TRAVIS: All right.

2356
01:34:43.403 --> 01:34:44.280
MARISHA: Break!

2357
01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:45.800
TALIESIN: If it goes, if it starts to go bad--

2358
01:34:45.800 --> 01:34:49.790
SAM: Wait for 55 minutes now while he meditates.

2359
01:34:49.790 --> 01:34:53.302
Wait, we can fly Caleb while he's meditating maybe.

2360
01:34:53.302 --> 01:34:55.552
(laughter)

2361
01:34:56.864 --> 01:34:58.220
SAM: All right, we'll all short rest.

2362
01:34:58.220 --> 01:35:00.110
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
MARISHA: All right, short rest.

2363
01:35:00.110 --> 01:35:02.840
MATT: All right, so take your short rest here.

2364
01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:03.950
Gather yourselves.

2365
01:35:03.950 --> 01:35:05.670
Make sure you have your healing potions

2366
01:35:05.670 --> 01:35:08.080
distributed amongst who's supposed to have them.

2367
01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:09.330
TALIESIN: Thank you for the reminder.

2368
01:35:09.330 --> 01:35:10.580
That's not foreboding at all.

2369
01:35:10.580 --> 01:35:12.120
MATT: No, not at all.

2370
01:35:12.120 --> 01:35:14.540
MARISHA: Is there anything else we can do to prepare?

2371
01:35:14.540 --> 01:35:16.490
Is there anything else we can do to prepare?

2372
01:35:16.490 --> 01:35:19.270
Us not-spellcasters. What do we do?

2373
01:35:19.270 --> 01:35:21.500
SAM: Do we have any set plays? What if we see them?

2374
01:35:21.500 --> 01:35:23.120
Okay, how are we getting out of here?

2375
01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:24.380
He's casting a spell.

2376
01:35:24.380 --> 01:35:27.060
But what if we walk out of the Wainwright tree

2377
01:35:27.060 --> 01:35:28.830
and they're there waiting for us?

2378
01:35:28.830 --> 01:35:30.180
TALIESIN: How are we even going to walk out?

2379
01:35:30.180 --> 01:35:32.600
LAURA: Soon as we get it, we bamf.
SAM: Oh, we just get it and go.

2380
01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:34.050
What if they walk in on us while

2381
01:35:34.050 --> 01:35:36.450
we're down there fiddling and diddling with something?

2382
01:35:36.450 --> 01:35:37.283
TALIESIN: Well, then we're dead.

2383
01:35:37.283 --> 01:35:40.050
MARISHA: We have team distraction.
LAURA: We're probably going to die.

2384
01:35:40.050 --> 01:35:41.780
TALIESIN: Yes, that's probably, we'll die.

2385
01:35:41.780 --> 01:35:44.230
TRAVIS: Where will we put this heart, in the bag?

2386
01:35:45.201 --> 01:35:46.862
LAURA: We can put it in one of the bags, yeah.

2387
01:35:46.862 --> 01:35:48.190
TRAVIS: The Bag of Holding or the haversack?

2388
01:35:48.190 --> 01:35:49.023
LAURA: Yeah.

2389
01:35:49.023 --> 01:35:52.323
SAM: And we're going to put maybe the string around

2390
01:35:52.323 --> 01:35:53.156
the tree?

2391
01:35:53.156 --> 01:35:54.260
To protect us?
LAURA: That's smart.

2392
01:35:54.260 --> 01:35:55.838
TALIESIN: If we can.
MARISHA: That'll work for now.

2393
01:35:55.838 --> 01:35:58.570
LIAM: We're looking at a minute range.
SAM: A minute range, all right.

2394
01:35:58.570 --> 01:36:01.620
Well maybe we could just put-- if we get there early,

2395
01:36:01.620 --> 01:36:03.230
we could put like just a physical--

2396
01:36:03.230 --> 01:36:04.660
MARISHA: Backtrack a little bit, yeah.

2397
01:36:04.660 --> 01:36:06.220
SAM: Well just like a trip wire

2398
01:36:06.220 --> 01:36:08.760
with some tin cans on it or something.

2399
01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:10.430
LAURA: Yeah, we could like do something.

2400
01:36:10.430 --> 01:36:11.780
TRAVIS: I knew I was keeping all those

2401
01:36:11.780 --> 01:36:15.290
canned anchovies for a reason, thank god.

2402
01:36:15.290 --> 01:36:17.120
It fucking reeks in here. I thought it was my armor.

2403
01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:18.770
TALIESIN: You're just becoming ninja hobos.

2404
01:36:18.770 --> 01:36:20.620
That's fine, okay.

2405
01:36:21.790 --> 01:36:23.010
SAM: You ready yet, Cay?

2406
01:36:23.010 --> 01:36:24.110
TRAVIS: An hour has passed.
MATT: All right.

2407
01:36:24.110 --> 01:36:25.040
LIAM: Has an hour passed?
MATT: Sure.

2408
01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:26.460
If you guys don't have anything else you wanted to prepare,

2409
01:36:26.460 --> 01:36:29.090
then yes, the short rest comes to a close.

2410
01:36:29.090 --> 01:36:32.650
Caleb slams his book closed in front of him

2411
01:36:32.650 --> 01:36:35.660
and you have regained your spell slot.

2412
01:36:35.660 --> 01:36:37.800
LIAM: I heard some of that, not much of it.

2413
01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:39.120
Another thing we could do when we're there

2414
01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:41.930
is I could throw up the dome while we're there

2415
01:36:41.930 --> 01:36:43.390
and then you would have the dome to run--

2416
01:36:43.390 --> 01:36:45.580
not me, I would be stuck inside of it but you could

2417
01:36:45.580 --> 01:36:49.330
run into it and out of it in case shit goes down.

2418
01:36:49.330 --> 01:36:51.940
MARISHA: That did work very well with the white dragon.

2419
01:36:51.940 --> 01:36:53.210
LAURA: It worked so well.

2420
01:36:53.210 --> 01:36:56.510
SAM: But we wouldn't have you in there to help us.

2421
01:36:56.510 --> 01:37:00.068
LIAM: Not necessarily so, thanks to our man Essek.

2422
01:37:00.068 --> 01:37:01.390
SAM: Oh!

2423
01:37:01.390 --> 01:37:02.340
TRAVIS: What do you mean?

2424
01:37:02.340 --> 01:37:04.080
SAM: You can put up the dome and not be in it?

2425
01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:06.971
LIAM: He has shown me how to

2426
01:37:06.971 --> 01:37:09.812
realize other versions of myself.

2427
01:37:09.812 --> 01:37:13.410
SAM: He polished your dome?
LAURA: That's really smart.

2428
01:37:13.410 --> 01:37:14.940
LIAM: That is not what happened.

2429
01:37:14.940 --> 01:37:17.250
LAURA: But wait, I think, didn't he say

2430
01:37:17.250 --> 01:37:20.520
as soon as your other version casts a spell,

2431
01:37:20.520 --> 01:37:22.573
they disappeared, right?

2432
01:37:24.340 --> 01:37:25.640
LIAM: We'll find out.

2433
01:37:25.640 --> 01:37:29.210
TRAVIS: Oh, good, yes, let's find out in the middle of it.

2434
01:37:29.210 --> 01:37:30.940
LIAM: Caleb would know, he would know

2435
01:37:30.940 --> 01:37:32.720
if he was told, but I don't remember.

2436
01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:34.580
LAURA: I thought I remembered that.

2437
01:37:34.580 --> 01:37:37.370
As soon as it casts a spell, it's gone.

2438
01:37:37.370 --> 01:37:38.203
MARISHA: The echoes?

2439
01:37:38.203 --> 01:37:40.090
LIAM: It still gets to cast a spell, yeah.

2440
01:37:40.090 --> 01:37:44.500
If it casts that 3rd-level spell, it's gone, gone?

2441
01:37:44.500 --> 01:37:46.130
MATT: Yeah, it vanishes once the spell's completed.

2442
01:37:46.130 --> 01:37:49.100
If it's a concentration spell, it stays around

2443
01:37:49.100 --> 01:37:51.980
to maintain the concentration until it gets killed.

2444
01:37:51.980 --> 01:37:55.260
LIAM: That's a great benefit.
LAURA: So that thing could cast the dome?

2445
01:37:55.260 --> 01:37:56.640
LIAM: No, no, no, I'm saying I would

2446
01:37:56.640 --> 01:37:58.290
cast the dome and sit within it.

2447
01:37:58.290 --> 01:38:01.340
And then you guys would have this great buffer

2448
01:38:01.340 --> 01:38:05.110
between you and our enemies you could run into and out of.

2449
01:38:05.110 --> 01:38:09.240
I could have most of our Teleportation Circle drawn

2450
01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:12.660
and you guys could pop in, pop out if we thought

2451
01:38:12.660 --> 01:38:14.260
that they were going to descend upon us

2452
01:38:14.260 --> 01:38:17.680
and I could also help from within by using Dunamancy.

2453
01:38:18.630 --> 01:38:19.463
LAURA: Okay.

2454
01:38:19.463 --> 01:38:21.190
LIAM: To a limited extent, but still.

2455
01:38:21.190 --> 01:38:22.150
TRAVIS: Sure.
MARISHA: I like it.

2456
01:38:22.150 --> 01:38:23.300
TRAVIS: That's a good option.

2457
01:38:24.260 --> 01:38:26.799
SAM: Let's fly.
TRAVIS: Like an eagle.

2458
01:38:26.799 --> 01:38:28.960
LIAM: Into the future.
MARISHA: To the tree.

2459
01:38:28.960 --> 01:38:30.535
LAURA: To the tree

2460
01:38:30.535 --> 01:38:32.945
MARISHA: ♪ Fly like an eagle ♪

2461
01:38:32.945 --> 01:38:34.622
TRAVIS: ♪ You get to carry me ♪

2462
01:38:34.622 --> 01:38:36.760
LAURA: I have to pee.

2463
01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:39.065
Are we taking a break?
MATT: I guess we shall, then.

2464
01:38:39.065 --> 01:38:41.340
(laughter)

2465
01:38:41.340 --> 01:38:45.400
As you guys prepare yourselves for this,

2466
01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:47.690
this plot you've hatched

2467
01:38:47.690 --> 01:38:51.520
to rush off into the night in hopes of

2468
01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:56.240
beating your adversaries to the very target they seek,

2469
01:38:56.240 --> 01:38:57.762
we're going to go ahead and take a break.

2470
01:38:57.762 --> 01:38:59.160
TALIESIN: With our polished dome.

2471
01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:00.440
MATT: So we'll return here shortly

2472
01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:02.920
to pick up where this adventure is leaving off.

2473
01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:06.450
We do have our Wyrmwood giveaway before we leave there.

2474
01:39:06.450 --> 01:39:09.420
If you guys haven't seen their awesome Kickstarter campaign,

2475
01:39:09.420 --> 01:39:12.270
this particular awesome dice vault

2476
01:39:12.270 --> 01:39:14.100
and it's a Hero Vault specifically,

2477
01:39:14.100 --> 01:39:16.070
which I think can be for dice or your hero

2478
01:39:16.070 --> 01:39:20.280
is drawn by our amazing Deven Rue on the front there.

2479
01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:21.660
The art for this Kickstarter campaign

2480
01:39:21.660 --> 01:39:23.738
contains art by Deven and Crystal Sully,

2481
01:39:23.738 --> 01:39:25.870
both amazing artists in the community.

2482
01:39:25.870 --> 01:39:27.700
Definitely check it out, if you haven't yet.

2483
01:39:27.700 --> 01:39:30.810
This awesome piece of, what type of wood is this?

2484
01:39:30.810 --> 01:39:31.670
It doesn't tell me, but

2485
01:39:31.670 --> 01:39:34.620
it's so pretty on the inside for all your dice.

2486
01:39:34.620 --> 01:39:37.460
It is pretty wood

2487
01:39:37.460 --> 01:39:40.130
that is not here, but I guarantee you

2488
01:39:40.130 --> 01:39:42.590
it feels nice, it looks nice, smells nice, it's great.

2489
01:39:42.590 --> 01:39:45.380
Goes to one lucky winner in the chat tonight.

2490
01:39:45.380 --> 01:39:49.670
The word for tonight is follow, F-O-L-L-O-W.

2491
01:39:49.670 --> 01:39:51.050
Put it in once.

2492
01:39:51.050 --> 01:39:52.110
More than once, you're disqualified.

2493
01:39:52.110 --> 01:39:53.960
Once again, US and Canada only, including Quebec.

2494
01:39:53.960 --> 01:39:55.460
We'll be back here with a winner shortly.

2495
01:39:55.460 --> 01:39:56.372
See you in a minute.

2496
01:39:56.372 --> 01:39:59.262
SAM: This is tense.
TALIESIN: So much could go wrong.

2497
01:39:59.262 --> 01:40:00.345

BRIAN (V.O.): Last time on Talks Machina.

2516
01:40:50.524 --> 01:40:54.570
BRIAN: How did it feel to hear
Beau's father for the first time?

2517
01:40:56.500 --> 01:40:58.970
MARISHA: Yeah, that was weird.

2518
01:40:58.970 --> 01:41:02.090
Because like Matt's never done his voice before.

2519
01:41:02.090 --> 01:41:03.060
TRAVIS: Right.

2520
01:41:03.060 --> 01:41:04.640
MARISHA: So I was like, "Oh!" and then he did it.

2521
01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:05.620
And I was like, "Oh fuck,

2522
01:41:05.620 --> 01:41:07.924
"my dad kind of sounds like a schmuck."

2523
01:41:07.924 --> 01:41:10.174
(laughter)

2524
01:41:12.010 --> 01:41:15.310
TRAVIS: He's a wine snob.
MARISHA: He's a wine snob, yeah.

2525
01:41:15.310 --> 01:41:16.143
BRIAN: Yep.

2526
01:41:16.143 --> 01:41:17.110
TRAVIS: Oh no.

2527
01:41:17.110 --> 01:41:18.850
MARISHA: Oh, shit.
TRAVIS: Did that help or hurt

2528
01:41:18.850 --> 01:41:21.570
your opinion of your backstory dad in your mind?

2529
01:41:21.570 --> 01:41:24.580
MARISHA: Man, people are going to watch this and be like,

2530
01:41:24.580 --> 01:41:26.676
"This makes so much more sense about Beau now."

2531
01:41:26.676 --> 01:41:29.980
BRIAN: How is Fjord settling into his new role?

2532
01:41:29.980 --> 01:41:32.130
Does he intend to perform specific acts

2533
01:41:32.130 --> 01:41:34.270
of service for the Wildmother

2534
01:41:34.270 --> 01:41:37.950
or does he see things being business as usual?

2535
01:41:37.950 --> 01:41:41.000
TRAVIS: Great question, WizardSimulator.

2536
01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.130
I have no fucking idea.

2537
01:41:44.390 --> 01:41:45.230
I have no clue.

2538
01:41:45.230 --> 01:41:48.110
It is definitely business as usual.

2539
01:41:48.110 --> 01:41:50.120
No particular plans for the Wildmother.

2540
01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:54.310
She did not send me a deal memo or anything of that nature.

2541
01:41:54.310 --> 01:41:55.830
I'm just winging it.

2542
01:41:55.830 --> 01:41:56.663
BRIAN: I understand.

2543
01:41:56.663 --> 01:42:00.170
TRAVIS: I'm making trees grow or perpetuating vine.

2544
01:42:00.170 --> 01:42:01.410
BRIAN: Yeah,

2545
01:42:01.410 --> 01:42:02.243
yep.

2546
01:42:03.214 --> 01:42:05.790
(laughter)

2547
01:42:05.790 --> 01:42:08.270
MARISHA: Wake up to like a non-compete just sitting

2548
01:42:08.270 --> 01:42:10.140
on your bedside table.

2549
01:42:10.140 --> 01:42:12.290
Like, "Oh, shit."

2550
01:42:12.290 --> 01:42:15.380
BRIAN: In the new character art, we see Fjord's tusks

2551
01:42:15.380 --> 01:42:17.430
have grown back to be visible.

2552
01:42:17.430 --> 01:42:20.940
Is this because of Jester's encouragement to accept them

2553
01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:23.710
as part of himself, Nott's struggle with her own appearance,

2554
01:42:23.710 --> 01:42:25.120
or something else?

2555
01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:27.000
TRAVIS: Well, shit, Alex Douglas.

2556
01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:30.730
I think it's all of the above, man.

2557
01:42:30.730 --> 01:42:33.990
Or ma'am, I don't want to assume.

2558
01:42:33.990 --> 01:42:35.830
Look, yeah.

2559
01:42:35.830 --> 01:42:38.614
(laughter)

2560
01:42:38.614 --> 01:42:39.780
DANI: What is going on?

2561
01:42:39.780 --> 01:42:41.570
TRAVIS: Nothing!
BRIAN: This episode will go down

2562
01:42:41.570 --> 01:42:44.620
in history as the least informative.

2563
01:42:45.620 --> 01:42:49.570
And this is a very uninformative program, folks.

2564
01:42:49.570 --> 01:42:52.410
This program--
TRAVIS: It's think all of the above, yes.

2565
01:42:52.410 --> 01:42:54.430
Jester definitely calling him out

2566
01:42:54.430 --> 01:42:57.400
and positively reinforcing him.

2567
01:42:57.400 --> 01:43:00.500
Letting his appearance be how it is helped.

2568
01:43:00.500 --> 01:43:04.810
I was definitely moved by what Nott and Sam said.

2569
01:43:04.810 --> 01:43:07.500
It shined a mirror on what my character

2570
01:43:07.500 --> 01:43:09.640
was going through as well, so it was all of those things.

2571
01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:12.930
BRIAN: I apologize, this is probably an emergency.

2572
01:43:12.930 --> 01:43:13.763
What?

2573
01:43:13.763 --> 01:43:16.100
SAM: What the hell is going on with your show?

2574
01:43:16.100 --> 01:43:17.950
BRIAN: What do you mean what's going on with my show?

2575
01:43:17.950 --> 01:43:20.920
I'm in the middle of, I'm on the 18th question.

2576
01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:22.650
This is probably one of the best shows

2577
01:43:22.650 --> 01:43:24.970
we've had in the last probably 10 years.

2578
01:43:25.900 --> 01:43:28.508
SAM: And are you guys smoking the dope?

2579
01:43:28.508 --> 01:43:30.180
BRIAN: We're not smoking the dope.

2580
01:43:30.180 --> 01:43:31.920
Apparently, we ate all of it earlier.

2581
01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:33.600
Now, there was two plates of brownies.

2582
01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:35.920
One of them had an XXX on the top of it.

2583
01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:37.770
SAM: Get it together, people.

2584
01:43:37.770 --> 01:43:39.700
Just get it together, that's all I'm going to say.

2585
01:43:39.700 --> 01:43:41.660
TRAVIS: Sam, where are you?
BRIAN: Where are you?

2586
01:43:41.660 --> 01:43:44.510
Are you in a Bed, Bath and Beyond?

2587
01:43:44.510 --> 01:43:47.680
SAM: I'm folding my kids' socks!

2588
01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:49.340
BRIAN: Why are you watching our show?

2589
01:43:49.340 --> 01:43:51.630
TRAVIS: Are your light bulbs like 600 watts?

2590
01:43:51.630 --> 01:43:53.170
What the fuck is going on in there?

2591
01:43:53.170 --> 01:43:54.640
BRIAN: That is more fluorescent light

2592
01:43:54.640 --> 01:43:57.657
than an elementary school detention room.

2593
01:43:58.630 --> 01:44:00.070
Why are you watching our show?

2594
01:44:00.070 --> 01:44:03.014
Did you finally catch up on Murder, She Wrote?

2595
01:44:03.014 --> 01:44:04.977
(laughter)

2596
01:44:04.977 --> 01:44:07.810
SAM: I'm just in my kid's room with Mister Monkey.

2597
01:44:07.810 --> 01:44:09.540
BRIAN: Oh yeah, your wife told me

2598
01:44:09.540 --> 01:44:11.832
what you guys do with Mister Monkey.

2599
01:44:14.281 --> 01:44:15.770
SAM: All right, go back to it.

2600
01:44:15.770 --> 01:44:17.080
Stay off the dope.

2601
01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:18.930
BRIAN: What if I just keep getting higher, Steve?

2602
01:44:18.930 --> 01:44:19.763
Can you do it?

2603
01:44:19.763 --> 01:44:20.680
I would like to thank--

2604
01:44:20.680 --> 01:44:21.890
DANI: You're as high as you possibly

2605
01:44:21.890 --> 01:44:24.150
can be right now, Brian.
BRIAN: Marisha and Travis

2606
01:44:24.150 --> 01:44:25.740
for joining us.

2607
01:44:25.740 --> 01:44:27.860
Episode 79 of Critical Role

2608
01:44:27.860 --> 01:44:30.627
airs this Thursday at 7:00pm Pacific.

2609
01:44:31.940 --> 01:44:34.610
As always, don't forget to love each other.

2610
01:44:34.610 --> 01:44:37.860
Don't worry, it's almost Thursday.

2611
01:44:37.860 --> 01:44:40.630
Stay turnt my friends and remember,

2612
01:44:40.630 --> 01:44:43.240
creepy ain't a crime.

2613
01:44:43.240 --> 01:44:44.934
Neither is D&amp;D.

2614
01:44:44.934 --> 01:44:49.917
(laughter)

2615
01:44:51.790 --> 01:44:54.930
TRAVIS: (V.O.) Last time on "Yee-Haw Game Ranch."

2616
01:44:54.930 --> 01:44:57.263
LIAM: (screaming)

2617
01:44:58.730 --> 01:45:00.120
BRIAN: What the fuck was that?

2618
01:45:00.120 --> 01:45:01.290
It sounds like it's in pain.

2619
01:45:01.290 --> 01:45:02.650
TRAVIS: I don't see anything.

2620
01:45:02.650 --> 01:45:03.770
BRIAN: No.
TRAVIS: We've been here so long,

2621
01:45:03.770 --> 01:45:05.530
the jungle's starting to grow out of us.

2622
01:45:05.530 --> 01:45:07.815
What are you talking about?
BRIAN: I'm fucking losing it, man.

2623
01:45:07.815 --> 01:45:10.556
LIAM: (screaming)

2624
01:45:10.556 --> 01:45:12.220
BRIAN: There it is.

2625
01:45:12.220 --> 01:45:15.140
TRAVIS: That's a monkey with an arm up its ass.

2626
01:45:17.382 --> 01:45:19.390
LIAM: That's rude!

2627
01:45:19.390 --> 01:45:22.010
BRIAN: Little fucker, what are you doing here?

2628
01:45:22.010 --> 01:45:25.556
LIAM: That's no way to greet a fellow adventurer!

2629
01:45:25.556 --> 01:45:27.360
Let me introduce myself.

2630
01:45:27.360 --> 01:45:30.602
I am the great adventurer,

2631
01:45:30.602 --> 01:45:33.067
Minnesota Jones.

2632
01:45:33.067 --> 01:45:34.680
BRIAN: Minnesota Jones?

2633
01:45:34.680 --> 01:45:35.790
What kind of name is that?

2634
01:45:35.790 --> 01:45:38.850
Sounds pretty similar to something I've heard before.

2635
01:45:38.850 --> 01:45:40.360
LIAM: It's probably a name

2636
01:45:40.360 --> 01:45:43.890
your daddy used to dodge child support.

2637
01:45:43.890 --> 01:45:45.678
TRAVIS: Whoa!

2638
01:45:45.678 --> 01:45:48.303
LIAM: Oh, oh, oh, oh!

2639
01:45:48.303 --> 01:45:50.670
You look like someone put a beard of pubes

2640
01:45:50.670 --> 01:45:52.678
on a piece of string cheese.

2641
01:45:55.070 --> 01:45:56.830
I'm just passing through on my way

2642
01:45:56.830 --> 01:45:59.310
to the temple of Zolgrux the Mad.

2643
01:45:59.310 --> 01:46:01.550
BRIAN: That's the place the stupid frog was talking about.

2644
01:46:01.550 --> 01:46:03.216
TRAVIS: Yeah.
BRIAN: Why are you going there?

2645
01:46:03.216 --> 01:46:05.010
LIAM: Rumor has it there's an ancient

2646
01:46:05.010 --> 01:46:07.810
tome buried with Zolgrux's body.

2647
01:46:07.810 --> 01:46:09.690
BRIAN: An ancient tome?

2648
01:46:09.690 --> 01:46:10.760
TRAVIS: Keep going.
BRIAN: What is that?

2649
01:46:10.760 --> 01:46:11.593
LIAM: I'll tell you

2650
01:46:11.593 --> 01:46:14.400
if you'd shut the fuck up for one second.

2651
01:46:14.400 --> 01:46:17.495
When you talk, your mouth looks like a rat's asshole!

2652
01:46:17.495 --> 01:46:18.960
(Travis laughing)

2653
01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:20.976
As I was saying,

2654
01:46:20.976 --> 01:46:25.076
they say it's a tome of realm-portation,

2655
01:46:25.076 --> 01:46:26.860
a powerful book of magic

2656
01:46:26.860 --> 01:46:30.170
that can transport you to another realm.

2657
01:46:30.170 --> 01:46:31.370
I'm still here.

2658
01:46:31.370 --> 01:46:34.210
I don't know about you, but I don't plan on living

2659
01:46:34.210 --> 01:46:37.160
the rest of my days out in this forsaken place.

2660
01:46:37.160 --> 01:46:41.050
This baby is tapped, and I got to get the fuck out of here!

2661
01:46:41.050 --> 01:46:42.840
BRIAN: What realm are you trying to travel to?

2662
01:46:42.840 --> 01:46:44.160
LIAM: Well I'll tell you, buddy,

2663
01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:45.470
I'll take anything I can get.

2664
01:46:45.470 --> 01:46:48.550
This jungle shit is boring as hell, man.

2665
01:46:48.550 --> 01:46:51.170
BRIAN: And who is Zolgrux the Mad?
TRAVIS: Good question.

2666
01:46:51.170 --> 01:46:52.560
LIAM: That is a good question.

2667
01:46:52.560 --> 01:46:55.850
No one really knows exactly who he was

2668
01:46:55.850 --> 01:46:59.040
but I've translated some glyphs I found around the island

2669
01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:02.080
and all that I've gathered is he was the first one

2670
01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:06.880
of his kind, some type of wizard or magic-user.

2671
01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:09.899
BRIAN: I mean, that magic sounds pretty cool.

2672
01:47:09.899 --> 01:47:11.070
I wonder what happened to him.

2673
01:47:11.070 --> 01:47:12.460
LIAM: Yeah, good question.

2674
01:47:12.460 --> 01:47:14.770
Who knows, Cardboard Face?

2675
01:47:14.770 --> 01:47:16.880
(laughter)

2676
01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:18.550
Tell you what though, I'll get a good look at him

2677
01:47:18.550 --> 01:47:21.360
when I pry this tomb open and get that book.

2678
01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:24.537
I'll see you suckers on the other side.

2679
01:47:24.537 --> 01:47:25.896
Later.

2680
01:47:25.896 --> 01:47:27.500
Hoo.

2681
01:47:27.500 --> 01:47:29.120
TRAVIS: Minnesota, don't leave.

2682
01:47:29.120 --> 01:47:31.220
You left your vine hanging.

2683
01:47:31.220 --> 01:47:32.390
BRIAN: You left your--

2684
01:47:32.390 --> 01:47:34.460
TRAVIS: Where do they go when they go down?

2685
01:47:34.460 --> 01:47:35.293
BRIAN: I don't know.

2686
01:47:35.293 --> 01:47:36.970
I would be just as curious--
TRAVIS: I haven't found a single--

2687
01:47:36.970 --> 01:47:39.170
BRIAN: -- to find out where they go when they go up.

2688
01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:40.953
TRAVIS: They explode?

2689
01:47:41.940 --> 01:47:43.020
Oh, they do!

2690
01:47:43.020 --> 01:47:44.670
That's disgusting!

2691
01:47:44.670 --> 01:47:46.570
That was amazing.
BRIAN: Do it again.

2692
01:47:46.570 --> 01:47:47.403
Yeah.
TRAVIS: Try to pop it.

2693
01:47:47.403 --> 01:47:48.560
BRIAN: Cut it open.
TRAVIS: Like a zit.

2694
01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:49.393
BRIAN: Do it.

2695
01:47:49.393 --> 01:47:50.260
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah.

2696
01:47:50.260 --> 01:47:52.707
I'm sure I'm fine, I'm sure I'm fine.

2697
01:47:52.707 --> 01:47:53.900
Didn't get in my eyes or mouth.

2698
01:47:53.900 --> 01:47:56.310
BRIAN: That's some Starship Trooper shit, man.

2699
01:47:56.310 --> 01:47:58.977
BRIAN and TRAVIS: We're sliding.

2700
01:47:59.973 --> 01:48:01.340
BRIAN: Ooh, that was cool.

2701
01:48:01.340 --> 01:48:02.810
That was cool.
GAME VOICE: So much for a silo.

2702
01:48:02.810 --> 01:48:04.104
BRIAN: Ooh.

2703
01:48:04.104 --> 01:48:04.937
TRAVIS: I don't think.

2704
01:48:04.937 --> 01:48:06.580
Can you give him CPR?

2705
01:48:06.580 --> 01:48:08.760
Can you give him a little help?

2706
01:48:08.760 --> 01:48:09.593
BRIAN: I think--

2707
01:48:09.593 --> 01:48:10.426
TRAVIS: Boy.

2708
01:48:10.426 --> 01:48:13.190
BRIAN: Does CPR unsmash your skull?

2709
01:48:14.950 --> 01:48:18.160
You don't even know how to use the chainsaw, my man.

2710
01:48:18.160 --> 01:48:21.050
TRAVIS: Punk.

2711
01:48:21.050 --> 01:48:22.340
BRIAN: How did you set him on fire by punching him?

2712
01:48:22.340 --> 01:48:23.950
TRAVIS: I have a flaming dagger.

2713
01:48:23.950 --> 01:48:24.800
BRIAN: Oh look, you could have shot

2714
01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:26.510
those barrels and exploded stuff.

2715
01:48:26.510 --> 01:48:28.090
Don't shoot it right now while you're standing next to it.

2716
01:48:28.090 --> 01:48:30.620
TRAVIS: You don't know that.
(explosion booming)

2717
01:48:30.620 --> 01:48:32.250
Those does explode.

2718
01:48:33.901 --> 01:48:36.390
BRIAN: There was four of them, dude.

2719
01:48:36.390 --> 01:48:38.430
Since the beginning of video games--

2720
01:48:38.430 --> 01:48:40.570
TRAVIS: More than four, I might add.
BRIAN: There've been red barrels--

2721
01:48:40.570 --> 01:48:42.753
TRAVIS: It could've been rum.
BRIAN: For one purpose only.

2722
01:48:42.753 --> 01:48:44.970
TRAVIS: Could've been wine.

2723
01:48:44.970 --> 01:48:49.970
(electronic humming)
(grunting)

2724
01:48:50.089 --> 01:48:51.140
MATT: (as Pumat Sol) Well!

2725
01:48:51.140 --> 01:48:53.982
Would you look at that, I think it worked.

2726
01:48:53.982 --> 01:48:55.956
You were right, Pumat Number Three.

2727
01:48:55.956 --> 01:48:59.283
All we had to do was invoke that subscription cantrip.

2728
01:49:00.177 --> 01:49:01.877
Pumat, Pumat Number Three?

2729
01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:05.448
Oh boy.

2730
01:49:05.448 --> 01:49:06.568
Well, hello there.

2731
01:49:06.568 --> 01:49:08.230
I am Pumat Prime.

2732
01:49:08.230 --> 01:49:12.220
It's good to finally join you here in the Prime Dimension.

2733
01:49:12.220 --> 01:49:17.220
I see this is the Twitch Prime Realm, I think.

2734
01:49:17.231 --> 01:49:18.439
Oh!

2735
01:49:18.439 --> 01:49:20.352
We're on the Critical Role Channel, aren't we?

2736
01:49:20.352 --> 01:49:21.960
Well, would you look at that?

2737
01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:24.440
You got chat and everything.

2738
01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:28.090
Respectfully, I was looking for the Prime Rib Realm,

2739
01:49:28.090 --> 01:49:30.800
but this isn't too bad.

2740
01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:33.020
You see, if you already have access

2741
01:49:33.020 --> 01:49:36.100
to the Amazon Prime Realm, you can get a free subscription

2742
01:49:36.100 --> 01:49:38.970
to the channel of your choice in the Twitch Prime Realm.

2743
01:49:38.970 --> 01:49:40.530
The two realms have a pretty good

2744
01:49:40.530 --> 01:49:42.960
working relationship after that peace treaty

2745
01:49:42.960 --> 01:49:45.880
the Prime Minister signed a few years back.

2746
01:49:45.880 --> 01:49:47.930
You just have to remember to renew

2747
01:49:47.930 --> 01:49:50.790
your Twitch Prime subscription at the top of each month,

2748
01:49:50.790 --> 01:49:54.720
respectfully and hey, if you're already a subscriber,

2749
01:49:54.720 --> 01:49:57.200
you can spread the joy by gifting a subscription

2750
01:49:57.200 --> 01:49:59.990
using the Gift a Sub button.

2751
01:49:59.990 --> 01:50:02.990
That is, assuming the Empire hasn't sent a tax man

2752
01:50:02.990 --> 01:50:04.910
to your shop here recently.

2753
01:50:07.080 --> 01:50:08.257
All right, well, off to find

2754
01:50:08.257 --> 01:50:10.834
that darn elusive Prime Rib Realm.

2755
01:50:10.834 --> 01:50:13.533
Who knew the Prime Dimension had so many pockets?

2756
01:50:14.530 --> 01:50:15.363
Good luck.

2757
01:50:18.139 --> 01:50:19.305
Pumat Three?

2758
01:50:22.460 --> 01:50:24.077
TALIESIN (V.O.): Subscribe.

2759
01:50:26.140 --> 01:50:27.773
Resubscribe!

2760
01:50:29.430 --> 01:50:32.500
Brian Foster is <i>not</i> a cabbage.

2761
01:50:34.526 --> 01:50:38.026
(dramatic orchestral music)

2762
02:03:21.961 --> 02:03:22.794
MATT: And welcome back.

2763
02:03:22.794 --> 02:03:24.170
Before jump into the game,

2764
02:03:24.170 --> 02:03:26.770
we do have our winner of the Wyrmwood giveaway.

2765
02:03:26.770 --> 02:03:29.790
The winner is Carnival Elite.

2766
02:03:29.790 --> 02:03:31.521
With a key.

2767
02:03:31.521 --> 02:03:34.190
Carnival Elite, you are the winner.

2768
02:03:34.190 --> 02:03:37.910
We'll go ahead and send that to you ASAP, congratulations.

2769
02:03:37.910 --> 02:03:40.540
TALIESIN: 123 feet.

2770
02:03:40.540 --> 02:03:41.373
MATT: All righty, friends.

2771
02:03:41.373 --> 02:03:42.420
TRAVIS: I don't need to be sweating like this.

2772
02:03:42.420 --> 02:03:44.375
We just got off the break.

2773
02:03:44.375 --> 02:03:45.520
Let's git 'er done.

2774
02:03:45.520 --> 02:03:46.740
SAM: Laura, did you have to pee again?

2775
02:03:46.740 --> 02:03:47.950
Maybe we should take another break.

2776
02:03:47.950 --> 02:03:50.340
LAURA: I got to pee, can we think about it some more?

2777
02:03:50.340 --> 02:03:51.965
TALIESIN: I can't understand you.

2778
02:03:53.383 --> 02:03:56.107
(Laura mumbling)
(Taliesin laughing)

2779
02:03:56.107 --> 02:03:57.265
TALIESIN and LAURA: Aaron Burr.

2780
02:03:57.265 --> 02:03:58.749
TALIESIN: Thank you.

2781
02:03:58.749 --> 02:04:00.080
TRAVIS: It'll be fine, it'll be fine.

2782
02:04:01.960 --> 02:04:04.270
MATT: So your rest complete,

2783
02:04:05.130 --> 02:04:06.570
the night

2784
02:04:06.570 --> 02:04:09.490
now darkens the entire sky above.

2785
02:04:10.570 --> 02:04:12.740
You can hear the heavy sound of crickets

2786
02:04:12.740 --> 02:04:16.350
and other nocturnal creatures coming to life out hunting,

2787
02:04:16.350 --> 02:04:19.460
wandering amongst the upper parts of the trees,

2788
02:04:19.460 --> 02:04:22.060
the lower parts of the forest and the sky above.

2789
02:04:23.520 --> 02:04:25.789
Mighty Nein, what would you like to do?

2790
02:04:25.789 --> 02:04:27.660
LAURA: Well, I guess we should turn

2791
02:04:27.660 --> 02:04:30.960
into big eagles or something, no?

2792
02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:32.550
LIAM: That's what you're going to do.

2793
02:04:32.550 --> 02:04:36.230
Caduceus, Fjord and I are just going to fly.

2794
02:04:36.230 --> 02:04:37.063
Are we ready?

2795
02:04:37.063 --> 02:04:39.120
LAURA: Is there such a thing as a giant owl?

2796
02:04:39.120 --> 02:04:41.000
LIAM: Yeah, of course there is.
TRAVIS: Whoa, time out, time out.

2797
02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:42.500
We don't know where we're going yet, right?

2798
02:04:42.500 --> 02:04:43.986
We have to find this thing.

2799
02:04:43.986 --> 02:04:46.059
SAM: We know the direction and the rough distance.

2800
02:04:46.059 --> 02:04:48.300
TRAVIS: It's the middle of the night.
LIAM: We have to move quickly.

2801
02:04:48.300 --> 02:04:49.300
TRAVIS: Is it a full moon?

2802
02:04:50.670 --> 02:04:53.730
MATT: No, it's probably like waning,

2803
02:04:53.730 --> 02:04:56.550
maybe a half moon.
SAM: But I think the dead body

2804
02:04:56.550 --> 02:04:59.840
we talked to said it was in a small clearing, right?

2805
02:05:00.970 --> 02:05:02.820
TALIESIN: I think it's going to be visible.

2806
02:05:02.820 --> 02:05:04.300
TRAVIS: Big tree in a bunch of trees, cool.

2807
02:05:04.300 --> 02:05:06.150
LAURA: Well, also--
TALIESIN: Dead.

2808
02:05:06.150 --> 02:05:09.990
LAURA: Once we see their firelight from the sky,

2809
02:05:09.990 --> 02:05:11.750
then we know we go past that.

2810
02:05:11.750 --> 02:05:13.320
TRAVIS: Good call.

2811
02:05:13.320 --> 02:05:17.660
You're very smart, all right, here we go.

2812
02:05:17.660 --> 02:05:19.350
MARISHA: Break.

2813
02:05:19.350 --> 02:05:22.610
LIAM: Caleb pulls out a raven's feather

2814
02:05:22.610 --> 02:05:24.450
and mutters a few arcane words

2815
02:05:24.450 --> 02:05:27.620
and suddenly Caduceus, Fjord, and Caleb

2816
02:05:27.620 --> 02:05:29.560
start to hover slightly above the ground.

2817
02:05:29.560 --> 02:05:31.630
MATT: So you're casting Fly at 5th-level?

2818
02:05:31.630 --> 02:05:32.940
LIAM: Yeah, no.

2819
02:05:32.940 --> 02:05:34.210
Four.

2820
02:05:34.210 --> 02:05:36.010
MATT: Fly is a 3rd-level spell.
LIAM: 3rd-level?

2821
02:05:36.010 --> 02:05:38.639
MATT: 4th-level, you can do an additional.

2822
02:05:38.639 --> 02:05:39.740
LIAM: Shit.
TRAVIS: Oh no,

2823
02:05:39.740 --> 02:05:41.475
the calculus is ruined!

2824
02:05:42.685 --> 02:05:44.420
SAM: What's Polymorph?

2825
02:05:44.420 --> 02:05:47.250
LIAM: Polymorph is not enough to carry everybody.

2826
02:05:47.250 --> 02:05:48.180
LIAM: Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.

2827
02:05:48.180 --> 02:05:49.880
SAM: Not if you're a giant something?

2828
02:05:51.620 --> 02:05:53.140
LAURA: Cast it on,

2829
02:05:53.140 --> 02:05:55.530
I can--
LIAM: You will hold onto me.

2830
02:05:55.530 --> 02:05:57.420
LAURA: Also, I--
SAM: Yes.

2831
02:05:57.420 --> 02:05:58.450
LAURA: Or I can carry--

2832
02:05:58.450 --> 02:06:00.080
SAM: I can hold on.

2833
02:06:00.080 --> 02:06:01.610
LAURA: Who am I carrying?

2834
02:06:01.610 --> 02:06:02.880
LIAM: Caduceus.

2835
02:06:02.880 --> 02:06:04.346
LAURA: Just Caduceus.

2836
02:06:05.400 --> 02:06:07.100
TRAVIS: What about Beau?
SAM: And Beau.

2837
02:06:07.100 --> 02:06:08.220
LAURA: And Beau.

2838
02:06:08.220 --> 02:06:09.240
TRAVIS: Can you carry Caduceus and Beau?

2839
02:06:09.240 --> 02:06:10.756
LAURA: What if you cast it on Caduceus

2840
02:06:10.756 --> 02:06:11.900
and I carry Beau and Nott?

2841
02:06:11.900 --> 02:06:15.310
Because I feel like I could do that easier than--

2842
02:06:15.310 --> 02:06:16.310
LIAM: Yeah, that's true.

2843
02:06:18.930 --> 02:06:21.130
So me and Caduceus.
MARISHA: And then Nott.

2844
02:06:21.130 --> 02:06:23.220
Maybe Cad can carry Nott?
LIAM: Well, wait, if you fly,

2845
02:06:23.220 --> 02:06:25.350
then I can fly with you.

2846
02:06:26.290 --> 02:06:27.490
LIAM: You will ride with me.

2847
02:06:28.930 --> 02:06:30.890
You will fly.

2848
02:06:30.890 --> 02:06:33.280
You will carry these two.

2849
02:06:33.280 --> 02:06:34.330
LAURA: Fjord and Beau.

2850
02:06:34.330 --> 02:06:35.600
LIAM: Correct.

2851
02:06:35.600 --> 02:06:36.433
LAURA: You got it.

2852
02:06:36.433 --> 02:06:37.700
TRAVIS: Can you carry us?

2853
02:06:37.700 --> 02:06:40.830
LAURA: Yeah, I can carry both of you.

2854
02:06:40.830 --> 02:06:44.060
As a giant owl, yeah, for sure.

2855
02:06:44.060 --> 02:06:45.140
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: Confirmed?

2856
02:06:46.320 --> 02:06:47.400
MATT: As a giant owl?

2857
02:06:47.400 --> 02:06:49.260
Yeah, you won't be traveling at maximum speed,

2858
02:06:49.260 --> 02:06:51.610
but you can, you know.
TALIESIN: You'll be doing fine.

2859
02:06:52.792 --> 02:06:54.120
MATT: I'd say it's allowed.
LIAM: Better than walking.

2860
02:06:54.120 --> 02:06:55.890
LAURA: Yeah, definitely.

2861
02:06:55.890 --> 02:06:58.610
We'll be above all of the totally

2862
02:06:58.610 --> 02:07:00.440
creepy things in the trees.

2863
02:07:00.440 --> 02:07:01.273
TRAVIS: Okay.

2864
02:07:01.273 --> 02:07:03.230
MARISHA: I'm riding up front.

2865
02:07:03.230 --> 02:07:06.340
TRAVIS: There are two feet. We're side by side.

2866
02:07:06.340 --> 02:07:07.790
MARISHA: I know, I'm riding up front, though.

2867
02:07:07.790 --> 02:07:09.010
TRAVIS: But there's no, it's not--

2868
02:07:09.010 --> 02:07:10.660
LAURA: I'll try to carry you in a way

2869
02:07:10.660 --> 02:07:12.210
that is comfortable for you, okay?

2870
02:07:12.210 --> 02:07:13.270
MARISHA: Oh, we're not riding on her back?

2871
02:07:13.270 --> 02:07:14.290
TRAVIS: No, we're literally,

2872
02:07:14.290 --> 02:07:15.710
I just told you that.

2873
02:07:15.710 --> 02:07:18.410
Don't look at me anymore. I'm mad at you now.

2874
02:07:18.410 --> 02:07:19.400
MARISHA: What?

2875
02:07:19.400 --> 02:07:20.550
What the fuck did I do?

2876
02:07:21.474 --> 02:07:22.750
LAURA: Ride on my back if you want.
MATT: Just to remind you,

2877
02:07:22.750 --> 02:07:26.690
you guys are traveling Polymorph and Fly, correct?

2878
02:07:27.730 --> 02:07:29.110
All righty.

2879
02:07:29.110 --> 02:07:30.760
LAURA: Polymorph lasts for an hour.

2880
02:07:30.760 --> 02:07:32.580
MATT: Right, Fly lasts for 10 minutes.

2881
02:07:32.580 --> 02:07:35.250
LIAM: 10 minutes only?

2882
02:07:35.250 --> 02:07:36.210
SAM: Why don't you just polymorph?

2883
02:07:36.210 --> 02:07:37.190
TRAVIS: Super important.

2884
02:07:38.080 --> 02:07:39.570
Super important.
LIAM: I could.

2885
02:07:39.570 --> 02:07:40.680
TRAVIS: Holy fuck.

2886
02:07:40.680 --> 02:07:42.730
MARISHA: The plan is falling apart

2887
02:07:42.730 --> 02:07:45.130
and we haven't even gotten out of camp.

2888
02:07:45.130 --> 02:07:46.960
MATT: I'm just double-checking.

2889
02:07:46.960 --> 02:07:49.740
TRAVIS: Holy fuck me running.

2890
02:07:49.740 --> 02:07:52.970
That would have been--
LIAM: No, we can still do it.

2891
02:07:52.970 --> 02:07:55.410
I can polymorph, I can,

2892
02:07:55.410 --> 02:07:57.130
and I can do giant eagle and I could,

2893
02:07:57.130 --> 02:07:59.130
we wouldn't go as fast as I would like,

2894
02:07:59.130 --> 02:08:01.680
but I can take Caduceus and Nott.

2895
02:08:01.680 --> 02:08:04.460
LAURA: Yeah, see?
LIAM: And you'll take these two.

2896
02:08:04.460 --> 02:08:05.293
LAURA: Yeah.

2897
02:08:05.293 --> 02:08:06.210
LIAM: But it means a slower speed,

2898
02:08:06.210 --> 02:08:07.370
but still faster than walking.

2899
02:08:07.370 --> 02:08:09.930
TALIESIN: You want to do giant eagle or giant owl?

2900
02:08:09.930 --> 02:08:11.070
LIAM: Eagle.

2901
02:08:11.070 --> 02:08:12.830
LAURA: You're going to be an eagle?
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

2902
02:08:12.830 --> 02:08:14.620
LAURA: Should I be an eagle too, is that better?

2903
02:08:14.620 --> 02:08:16.400
SAM: Can one of those see in the dark?

2904
02:08:16.400 --> 02:08:18.120
LAURA: Well, owls are really good at seeing in the dark.

2905
02:08:18.120 --> 02:08:20.091
SAM: Can you check your fucking stats?

2906
02:08:20.091 --> 02:08:21.307
LAURA: Yeah.

2907
02:08:21.307 --> 02:08:23.770
(laughter)

2908
02:08:23.770 --> 02:08:25.098
TRAVIS: Look at Matt's face.

2909
02:08:25.098 --> 02:08:27.087
SAM: I know what real owls are.

2910
02:08:28.950 --> 02:08:29.975
MATT: All righty.

2911
02:08:29.975 --> 02:08:31.020
TALIESIN: It's a burrow owl.

2912
02:08:31.020 --> 02:08:32.022
LAURA: Owl.

2913
02:08:32.022 --> 02:08:32.855
LIAM: I would like to think the people who

2914
02:08:32.855 --> 02:08:35.590
are riding are doing the most of the looking out.

2915
02:08:35.590 --> 02:08:36.810
LAURA: How do I find it again?

2916
02:08:36.810 --> 02:08:38.150
SAM: I already put it in there for you.

2917
02:08:38.150 --> 02:08:40.630
LAURA: You didn't put a giant owl in there.

2918
02:08:40.630 --> 02:08:42.310
SAM: Where's all your creatures?

2919
02:08:42.310 --> 02:08:43.143
LAURA: I don't know.

2920
02:08:43.143 --> 02:08:45.030
MATT: So you guys are polymorphing, you said.

2921
02:08:45.980 --> 02:08:47.640
Caleb, you're the giant eagle.

2922
02:08:47.640 --> 02:08:49.120
LIAM: Owls have darkvision.

2923
02:08:49.120 --> 02:08:51.095
LAURA: Owls have darkvision.

2924
02:08:52.701 --> 02:08:54.059
SAM: Giant eagle.

2925
02:08:54.059 --> 02:08:55.910
LIAM: But I'm going to do eagle because I feel like an eagle

2926
02:08:55.910 --> 02:09:00.020
has a better chance of carrying Caduceus and Nott.

2927
02:09:00.020 --> 02:09:02.250
LAURA: Owls are just as strong.

2928
02:09:02.250 --> 02:09:03.850
MARISHA: Yeah, if they're both giant.
LIAM: Are they?

2929
02:09:03.850 --> 02:09:04.683
LAURA: Yeah.

2930
02:09:04.683 --> 02:09:06.740
MARISHA: If they're both giant, isn't it semantics?

2931
02:09:06.740 --> 02:09:09.320
SAM: Eagle has strength 16, what about owl?

2932
02:09:09.320 --> 02:09:11.410
LAURA: I don't know if there's giant owl stats.

2933
02:09:11.410 --> 02:09:14.620
LIAM: 13, so eagle is categorically stronger than owl.

2934
02:09:14.620 --> 02:09:15.880
MATT: It is.
LAURA: Okay, okay.

2935
02:09:15.880 --> 02:09:18.120
But owls have night vision.
LIAM: And he is a giant

2936
02:09:18.120 --> 02:09:19.400
reindeer man, so.
TALIESIN: Thank you.

2937
02:09:19.400 --> 02:09:21.240
LIAM: I'm going to be an eagle.

2938
02:09:21.240 --> 02:09:23.030
TALIESIN: I don't weigh a ton, but I am big, so.

2939
02:09:23.030 --> 02:09:24.780
TRAVIS: He cannot see in the dark either.

2940
02:09:25.710 --> 02:09:28.880
Can an eagle see in the dark?

2941
02:09:28.880 --> 02:09:29.870
MATT: He can see as well as any other

2942
02:09:29.870 --> 02:09:31.590
creature that doesn't have darkvision.

2943
02:09:33.318 --> 02:09:34.190
TALIESIN: The owl will lead.

2944
02:09:34.190 --> 02:09:35.470
MARISHA: It will lead and scout.

2945
02:09:35.470 --> 02:09:37.490
LIAM: Goblin, you have darkvision?

2946
02:09:37.490 --> 02:09:39.820
SAM: Yes, I do.
TRAVIS: I do as well.

2947
02:09:39.820 --> 02:09:41.670
LAURA: Where did you find the stats for the giant owl?

2948
02:09:41.670 --> 02:09:42.720
MARISHA: I have goggles, I'm good.

2949
02:09:42.720 --> 02:09:45.230
TALIESIN: I'm always the one without darkvision.

2950
02:09:45.230 --> 02:09:47.655
LAURA: Never mind, Sam did it for me.

2951
02:09:47.655 --> 02:09:49.870
MATT: You do have advantage on wisdom and perception checks

2952
02:09:49.870 --> 02:09:52.000
to see, which means it counteracts
the disadvantage, so it'll

2953
02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.838
be just a straight roll for you in the dark with perception.

2954
02:09:54.838 --> 02:09:56.680
LAURA: With plus eight to stealth.

2955
02:09:56.680 --> 02:09:58.060
Owls are stealthy.

2956
02:09:58.060 --> 02:09:58.893
MATT: They are.

2957
02:09:59.776 --> 02:10:01.600
LIAM: So do it, I'm ready to be an eagle.

2958
02:10:01.600 --> 02:10:03.560
MATT: So the giant eagle,

2959
02:10:03.560 --> 02:10:04.980
which is the larger of the two, I'll say.

2960
02:10:04.980 --> 02:10:06.360
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: That'd be you.

2961
02:10:06.360 --> 02:10:07.820
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: You are carrying?

2962
02:10:07.820 --> 02:10:08.950
LIAM: Caduceus and Nott.

2963
02:10:08.950 --> 02:10:11.280
MATT: Caduceus and Nott, all right, we have Nott.

2964
02:10:11.280 --> 02:10:13.350
TALIESIN: Aw, they got little sticky things.

2965
02:10:13.350 --> 02:10:15.120
LAURA: Look at that!
SAM: Where'd you get that shit?

2966
02:10:15.120 --> 02:10:15.953
MATT: I've had it for a while.

2967
02:10:15.953 --> 02:10:17.980
LAURA: That's awesome.
LIAM: From the craft store.

2968
02:10:17.980 --> 02:10:19.730
MATT: There we go, got them riding up there.

2969
02:10:19.730 --> 02:10:20.886
LAURA: Look at that.

2970
02:10:20.886 --> 02:10:21.950
TALIESIN: ♪ Fly like an eagle ♪

2971
02:10:21.950 --> 02:10:23.740
MATT: All right and then

2972
02:10:23.740 --> 02:10:26.250
Fjord and Beau on the

2973
02:10:27.230 --> 02:10:28.700
owl train, right?
LAURA: Yeah.

2974
02:10:28.700 --> 02:10:29.610
TRAVIS: I'm on the left foot,

2975
02:10:29.610 --> 02:10:31.710
is that okay with you if on the left foot?

2976
02:10:32.920 --> 02:10:34.160
MARISHA: I mean, it feels a little like

2977
02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:36.740
the driver's seat, but it's fine.

2978
02:10:36.740 --> 02:10:38.900
I'll take the passenger claw.

2979
02:10:38.900 --> 02:10:40.070
TRAVIS: It depends on the country, though.

2980
02:10:40.070 --> 02:10:42.390
LIAM: If we're in the UK, you are good.

2981
02:10:42.390 --> 02:10:43.730
MARISHA: Oh, we are in Xhorhas.

2982
02:10:43.730 --> 02:10:45.400
Yeah, I'll take the right!

2983
02:10:45.400 --> 02:10:47.763
LAURA: Okay, both of you need to shut up.

2984
02:10:47.763 --> 02:10:49.490
MARISHA: Sorry.
LAURA: Once we start moving.

2985
02:10:49.490 --> 02:10:52.240
I need to be stealthy,

2986
02:10:52.240 --> 02:10:53.790
so shut up.
TRAVIS: She needs to be stealthy,

2987
02:10:53.790 --> 02:10:55.465
so shut up.

2988
02:10:57.049 --> 02:10:58.980
MARISHA: What the fuck did I do?

2989
02:10:58.980 --> 02:11:01.110
SAM: All right, Fjord, Beau, Caduceus,

2990
02:11:01.110 --> 02:11:02.930
we have to be on the lookout.

2991
02:11:02.930 --> 02:11:04.030
Keep your eyes peeled.

2992
02:11:04.030 --> 02:11:05.840
Give us some guidance and stuff.

2993
02:11:05.840 --> 02:11:06.810
TALIESIN: I can't see anything.

2994
02:11:06.810 --> 02:11:08.110
MATT: So here's my question.

2995
02:11:08.110 --> 02:11:09.810
Are you guys moving at maximum speed

2996
02:11:09.810 --> 02:11:11.820
or are you moving stealthily?

2997
02:11:11.820 --> 02:11:13.050
You can make a stealth check either way, but if you're

2998
02:11:13.050 --> 02:11:15.830
moving full speed, it's disadvantage on stealth checks.

2999
02:11:15.830 --> 02:11:16.971
MARISHA: Speed.

3000
02:11:16.971 --> 02:11:18.760
TRAVIS: No, we can't do Pass Without a Trace.

3001
02:11:18.760 --> 02:11:20.460
LAURA: But we're making (groans).

3002
02:11:20.460 --> 02:11:21.293
MARISHA: We're in the air.

3003
02:11:21.293 --> 02:11:23.840
TRAVIS: We're going high, above the canopy of trees.

3004
02:11:23.840 --> 02:11:24.920
MARISHA: We got to get there, man.

3005
02:11:24.920 --> 02:11:26.660
TALIESIN: We're also, I assume, not going to make it

3006
02:11:26.660 --> 02:11:27.700
because we're going to do a little bit

3007
02:11:27.700 --> 02:11:29.180
of curve-around where we think they are.

3008
02:11:29.180 --> 02:11:30.090
LIAM: It's also nighttime.

3009
02:11:30.090 --> 02:11:32.550
TRAVIS: No, we need to go over their campsite, don't we?

3010
02:11:32.550 --> 02:11:34.150
LIAM: We have no idea where they are.

3011
02:11:34.150 --> 02:11:35.250
LAURA: But we can see smoke.

3012
02:11:35.250 --> 02:11:36.940
We'll be able to see smoke and firelight.

3013
02:11:36.940 --> 02:11:37.790
TRAVIS: ♪ We will. ♪

3014
02:11:37.790 --> 02:11:41.690
MARISHA: Look, if we were doing Plan B
with the Laughing Hand,

3015
02:11:41.690 --> 02:11:43.840
then I would say the goal would be stealth

3016
02:11:43.840 --> 02:11:45.790
but since we're doing Plan C, we're just trying

3017
02:11:45.790 --> 02:11:48.813
to get to the tree, I think the goal is speed.

3018
02:11:48.813 --> 02:11:50.050
LAURA: We definitely want to not--
SAM: What if they see us?

3019
02:11:50.050 --> 02:11:50.950
MARISHA: What are they going to fucking do?

3020
02:11:50.950 --> 02:11:52.840
SAM: They're going to see two birds over them.

3021
02:11:52.840 --> 02:11:54.010
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: They don't give a shit.

3022
02:11:54.010 --> 02:11:55.830
LIAM: In the dark and we're moving way faster than them.

3023
02:11:55.830 --> 02:11:57.840
I think we should (cawing).

3024
02:11:57.840 --> 02:11:58.970
LAURA: What happened?

3025
02:11:58.970 --> 02:12:00.095
We had to transform.

3026
02:12:00.095 --> 02:12:01.720
LIAM: I think we should go as quickly as possible, yeah.

3027
02:12:01.720 --> 02:12:03.995
SAM: Let's go.
LAURA: But make a berth around them.

3028
02:12:03.995 --> 02:12:07.310
I don't want you, I don't want to fly directly overhead.

3029
02:12:07.310 --> 02:12:09.450
If I see the campfire, I'm not going to go directly over it.

3030
02:12:09.450 --> 02:12:11.280
LIAM: Of course, if we see the campfire, yeah.

3031
02:12:11.280 --> 02:12:12.672
TRAVIS and SAM: Okay.

3032
02:12:12.672 --> 02:12:15.860
MATT: Okay.

3033
02:12:15.860 --> 02:12:17.250
SAM: We suck at this.

3034
02:12:17.250 --> 02:12:18.850
TRAVIS: We're amazing.

3035
02:12:18.850 --> 02:12:20.150
MATT: You guys transform.

3036
02:12:20.150 --> 02:12:23.190
LIAM: Yeah and also, this is Caleb's Transmuter ability

3037
02:12:23.190 --> 02:12:25.090
to not use a spell slot.

3038
02:12:25.090 --> 02:12:27.170
He can polymorph himself once a day.

3039
02:12:27.170 --> 02:12:29.670
MATT: That's right, you are correct.

3040
02:12:29.670 --> 02:12:30.690
All righty.
LIAM: It's a level one,

3041
02:12:30.690 --> 02:12:32.381
which is eagle is within.

3042
02:12:32.381 --> 02:12:33.310
MATT: It's pretty great.

3043
02:12:33.310 --> 02:12:35.510
So transforming into a giant eagle and a giant owl.

3044
02:12:35.510 --> 02:12:36.470
The owl, which is stealthier.

3045
02:12:36.470 --> 02:12:37.480
The eagle, which is a little stronger.

3046
02:12:37.480 --> 02:12:38.910
It can move a little faster.

3047
02:12:38.910 --> 02:12:41.380
But either you're going to move ahead of the owl

3048
02:12:41.380 --> 02:12:42.820
or you'll stay in tandem with it.
LIAM: I'll take point,

3049
02:12:42.820 --> 02:12:45.030
but I'm not going to move that far ahead.

3050
02:12:45.030 --> 02:12:48.570
MATT: So traveling through and overhead,

3051
02:12:48.570 --> 02:12:53.290
you both grab your respective party members and (whooshing).

3052
02:12:55.920 --> 02:12:59.300
Pushing through the canopy of the forest.

3053
02:12:59.300 --> 02:13:00.200
A little difficult at first,

3054
02:13:00.200 --> 02:13:02.300
finding areas to squeeze through.

3055
02:13:02.300 --> 02:13:03.740
Even this opening here, you know,

3056
02:13:03.740 --> 02:13:05.230
there's a lot of branches that are all

3057
02:13:05.230 --> 02:13:07.550
reaching out and creating a net,

3058
02:13:07.550 --> 02:13:09.940
but you break through and smash across them,

3059
02:13:09.940 --> 02:13:13.630
sending splinters of various bits of wood and bark flying

3060
02:13:13.630 --> 02:13:15.580
as you both emerge into the night sky

3061
02:13:15.580 --> 02:13:17.780
over the Lotusden Greenwood.

3062
02:13:17.780 --> 02:13:19.490
The moon high up, a little bit

3063
02:13:19.490 --> 02:13:21.040
of white light that's beginning to trickle

3064
02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:24.290
across the slightly shifting forest

3065
02:13:24.290 --> 02:13:28.170
with the breezes that occasionally push through.

3066
02:13:28.170 --> 02:13:31.470
You are above the space, looking in the general direction

3067
02:13:31.470 --> 02:13:33.440
of which you were intending to travel.

3068
02:13:33.440 --> 02:13:38.440
So you both go into a slight dive and pick up,

3069
02:13:38.850 --> 02:13:41.960
using the wind to your advantage and try and continue pace.

3070
02:13:41.960 --> 02:13:43.980
Are you going stealthily or speed?

3071
02:13:43.980 --> 02:13:48.010
LAURA: Do we see the firelight from above?

3072
02:13:48.010 --> 02:13:50.320
MATT: Make a perception check, each of you.

3073
02:13:50.320 --> 02:13:51.580
Disadvantage for you.
LIAM: Everybody?

3074
02:13:51.580 --> 02:13:53.630
I mean, I'm just flying.

3075
02:13:53.630 --> 02:13:55.720
One of the last things I said was, "I'm just flying,"

3076
02:13:55.720 --> 02:13:57.500
and my riders should--
MATT: Got you, then yes.

3077
02:13:57.500 --> 02:13:59.150
You can try from your space.

3078
02:13:59.150 --> 02:14:00.390
MARISHA: Perception?

3079
02:14:00.390 --> 02:14:02.380
MATT: Perception.
LAURA: It won't let you guide me.

3080
02:14:02.380 --> 02:14:03.390
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

3081
02:14:03.390 --> 02:14:04.400
MARISHA: I rolled good.

3082
02:14:04.400 --> 02:14:05.800
TRAVIS: 22 total.

3083
02:14:05.800 --> 02:14:07.510
MARISHA: 20 total.

3084
02:14:07.510 --> 02:14:09.460
MATT: Well as a group, check for this.

3085
02:14:09.460 --> 02:14:13.950
Two people are helming the perspective on here. It's okay.

3086
02:14:13.950 --> 02:14:14.783
So?

3087
02:14:14.783 --> 02:14:15.680
LAURA: 19.
MATT: 19 and?

3088
02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:17.260
TRAVIS: Natural 20.
MATT: Which is a total of?

3089
02:14:17.260 --> 02:14:19.297
TRAVIS: 22.
MATT: 22, okay.

3090
02:14:21.090 --> 02:14:23.680
Continuing forward for the first 20 minutes

3091
02:14:23.680 --> 02:14:24.990
or so of your journey in that direction,

3092
02:14:24.990 --> 02:14:29.472
you do not see any sign of any glow or flame.

3093
02:14:30.450 --> 02:14:31.540
TRAVIS: Speed.

3094
02:14:31.540 --> 02:14:32.580
MATT: Because you roll high doesn't mean

3095
02:14:32.580 --> 02:14:34.680
you're near enough to see anything or that

3096
02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:39.570
it magically apparates through the tree branches above.

3097
02:14:39.570 --> 02:14:43.510
It is deep within the Lotusden beneath you.

3098
02:14:43.510 --> 02:14:45.610
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: So you do not see anything.

3099
02:14:45.610 --> 02:14:46.443
SAM and LAURA: Okay.

3100
02:14:47.600 --> 02:14:50.100
LAURA: Then we fly in the direction that we know it is

3101
02:14:51.570 --> 02:14:54.790
and keep an eye out for the other tree.

3102
02:14:55.840 --> 02:14:56.680
MATT: Full speed?

3103
02:14:56.680 --> 02:14:58.690
LIAM: Strange trees.
SAM: Full speed.

3104
02:14:58.690 --> 02:15:00.760
LAURA: Full speed for a bit and then like

3105
02:15:01.947 --> 02:15:03.180
if it feels like we're going too far,

3106
02:15:03.180 --> 02:15:05.950
then I say slow down so we can look a little bit better.

3107
02:15:05.950 --> 02:15:06.910
MATT: Well, put it this way.

3108
02:15:06.910 --> 02:15:09.620
It was between-- they're about

3109
02:15:09.620 --> 02:15:11.320
three to six hours ahead of you.

3110
02:15:11.320 --> 02:15:15.330
You're not entirely certain how far this location is.

3111
02:15:15.330 --> 02:15:16.770
LAURA: A day's travel.
MARISHA: A day's travel, yeah.

3112
02:15:16.770 --> 02:15:18.590
MATT: Right, okay, so you're a little bit.

3113
02:15:19.890 --> 02:15:21.880
So you'll be able to catch, to get ahead of them,

3114
02:15:21.880 --> 02:15:24.770
but you will not within the hour that you have transformed

3115
02:15:24.770 --> 02:15:27.260
be able to make a day's worth of traveling.

3116
02:15:27.260 --> 02:15:28.093
LAURA: Right.

3117
02:15:28.093 --> 02:15:31.600
MATT: So you will gain some

3118
02:15:31.600 --> 02:15:33.600
movement, hopefully enough, but you're uncertain

3119
02:15:33.600 --> 02:15:36.020
at this time if it's where it'll be.

3120
02:15:36.020 --> 02:15:37.860
A half an hour.

3121
02:15:37.860 --> 02:15:38.840
MARISHA: Full speed.

3122
02:15:38.840 --> 02:15:39.850
MATT: 40 minutes.

3123
02:15:41.460 --> 02:15:43.020
50 minutes.
LAURA: As it gets close

3124
02:15:43.020 --> 02:15:47.650
to when I'm going to poof, then I'll land and cast it again.

3125
02:15:48.740 --> 02:15:50.290
MATT: If you guys want to, right before you begin to land,

3126
02:15:50.290 --> 02:15:52.550
make an additional series of perception checks.

3127
02:15:52.550 --> 02:15:53.960
Who's helming this?

3128
02:15:53.960 --> 02:15:57.390
Two of you can make it or one of you can make it advantage.

3129
02:15:57.390 --> 02:15:59.020
LAURA: Okay, I've got night vision.
TALIESIN: Oh, I can't.

3130
02:15:59.020 --> 02:15:59.880
Yeah, I can't help you.

3131
02:15:59.880 --> 02:16:01.380
MATT: Yeah, you have disadvantage.

3132
02:16:05.609 --> 02:16:07.109
SAM: Whole load of shit.
LAURA: Yeah.

3133
02:16:08.220 --> 02:16:09.920
Yeah, 11.

3134
02:16:09.920 --> 02:16:11.430
MATT: 11, okay.

3135
02:16:11.430 --> 02:16:13.500
As you begin to descend towards the treeline,

3136
02:16:13.500 --> 02:16:15.930
knowing that the loss of your

3137
02:16:15.930 --> 02:16:18.790
polymorph transformation is imminent,

3138
02:16:18.790 --> 02:16:20.490
you glance ahead in the direction you've

3139
02:16:20.490 --> 02:16:24.510
been traveling this entire time and you unfortunately,

3140
02:16:24.510 --> 02:16:27.010
even in the dark of night, can't make out enough detail

3141
02:16:27.010 --> 02:16:30.720
that tells you where the transition would be to the--

3142
02:16:30.720 --> 02:16:33.380
LAURA: Oh wait, my perception, sorry.

3143
02:16:33.380 --> 02:16:35.320
It's different for a giant owl.

3144
02:16:35.320 --> 02:16:38.160
It was actually--
SAM: Oh, that's right.

3145
02:16:38.160 --> 02:16:40.620
LAURA: Yeah, it was a 14,

3146
02:16:40.620 --> 02:16:42.350
15, sorry.

3147
02:16:42.350 --> 02:16:43.183
MATT: 15?

3148
02:16:43.183 --> 02:16:44.910
LAURA: Yes.
SAM: That's much better.

3149
02:16:44.910 --> 02:16:46.810
Owls, owls, yo.

3150
02:16:46.810 --> 02:16:48.460
LAURA: That's why I did it.

3151
02:16:48.460 --> 02:16:50.840
MATT: That makes a difference.

3152
02:16:50.840 --> 02:16:53.290
As you begin to just hit the top of the treeline,

3153
02:16:53.290 --> 02:16:56.920
looking up ahead, you can see it's a ways off still,

3154
02:16:56.920 --> 02:17:00.650
but the way the bit of moonlight is hitting the canopy,

3155
02:17:00.650 --> 02:17:03.310
you can see where the texture begins to change.

3156
02:17:03.310 --> 02:17:07.150
First, a small pocket a ways away,

3157
02:17:07.150 --> 02:17:08.683
where the canopy seems to dip

3158
02:17:09.550 --> 02:17:11.958
and you can see a few,

3159
02:17:13.850 --> 02:17:16.580
100 to 200, you don't know how many, but like

3160
02:17:16.580 --> 02:17:20.842
thin spire-like tops of leafless trees.

3161
02:17:20.842 --> 02:17:21.884
SAM: Okay, okay.

3162
02:17:21.884 --> 02:17:24.919
LAURA: Oh gosh, okay, okay, okay.

3163
02:17:24.919 --> 02:17:26.630
MATT: Still a way's travel from here.

3164
02:17:26.630 --> 02:17:27.940
LAURA: But good to know.

3165
02:17:27.940 --> 02:17:30.210
MATT: But you now have an orientation of direction.

3166
02:17:30.210 --> 02:17:31.710
LAURA: We have a visual, okay.

3167
02:17:31.710 --> 02:17:34.070
You don't have to recast, you just can sustain this.

3168
02:17:34.070 --> 02:17:35.530
Or you have to recast?
LIAM: No, I need to go again.

3169
02:17:35.530 --> 02:17:37.880
I just didn't have to spend a spell slot the last time,

3170
02:17:37.880 --> 02:17:39.800
but this time I do and I will.

3171
02:17:39.800 --> 02:17:40.680
LAURA: Okay, same.

3172
02:17:41.740 --> 02:17:43.290
MATT: So you both land.

3173
02:17:43.290 --> 02:17:44.790
LIAM: Yeah.

3174
02:17:44.790 --> 02:17:45.940
MATT: And you cast again.

3175
02:17:45.940 --> 02:17:46.773
TRAVIS: Quietly.

3176
02:17:48.620 --> 02:17:49.680
MATT: All right.

3177
02:17:49.680 --> 02:17:54.050
Emerging (whooshing), you head back up through the canopy

3178
02:17:54.050 --> 02:17:55.908
where you landed originally

3179
02:17:57.050 --> 02:17:59.720
into the sky and traveling that direction again,

3180
02:17:59.720 --> 02:18:00.700
growing closer and closer.

3181
02:18:00.700 --> 02:18:02.450
Full speed or stealth?

3182
02:18:02.450 --> 02:18:04.220
LAURA: Did we see firelight?

3183
02:18:04.220 --> 02:18:06.210
MATT: Make a perception check, if you'd like.

3184
02:18:07.810 --> 02:18:10.000
LAURA: Am I doing it advantage, is anybody helping?

3185
02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:11.620
What's going on?
TRAVIS: I'll help you.

3186
02:18:11.620 --> 02:18:13.050
MARISHA: Fjord'll help you.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3187
02:18:13.050 --> 02:18:14.000
SAM: Pick better dice.

3188
02:18:14.890 --> 02:18:17.970
MATT: Shouting loudly to the owl across the way.

3189
02:18:19.250 --> 02:18:20.450
MARISHA: It was like about to.

3190
02:18:21.680 --> 02:18:22.513
16,

3191
02:18:22.513 --> 02:18:23.570
no, 17.

3192
02:18:23.570 --> 02:18:25.140
Thank you.
MATT: 17, okay.

3193
02:18:25.140 --> 02:18:27.230
TALIESIN: They're on the same thing.
MATT: Yeah.

3194
02:18:28.140 --> 02:18:29.698
Continuing on,

3195
02:18:30.710 --> 02:18:32.760
you don't really notice any sort of firelight.

3196
02:18:33.800 --> 02:18:35.100
Even the scry, it was low,

3197
02:18:36.530 --> 02:18:39.020
so you unfortunately aren't able to make out any

3198
02:18:39.020 --> 02:18:42.600
details as you're looking down, continuing forward.

3199
02:18:42.600 --> 02:18:44.950
Coasting above, the wind blowing past

3200
02:18:44.950 --> 02:18:46.893
your stealthy owl feathers,

3201
02:18:48.002 --> 02:18:49.740
the rest of you glancing down below as well.

3202
02:18:49.740 --> 02:18:50.620
There are other birds

3203
02:18:50.620 --> 02:18:52.740
and other large evening flying creatures

3204
02:18:52.740 --> 02:18:54.280
that you can see are looking ahead

3205
02:18:54.280 --> 02:18:57.050
and a few of them begin to turn

3206
02:18:57.050 --> 02:19:01.040
and notice the size of you and the clustering

3207
02:19:01.040 --> 02:19:04.770
of the two large flying creatures and seem to veer off.

3208
02:19:04.770 --> 02:19:08.140
MARISHA: Other large flying creatures?

3209
02:19:08.140 --> 02:19:10.420
Do I get any sense of what these

3210
02:19:10.420 --> 02:19:11.253
other large flying creatures could be?

3211
02:19:11.253 --> 02:19:13.610
MATT: Too far away to make out any specific details.

3212
02:19:14.480 --> 02:19:16.240
But you can see in the distance other like

3213
02:19:16.240 --> 02:19:19.870
things that fly, other hunters, other nocturnal predators.

3214
02:19:19.870 --> 02:19:23.760
TALIESIN: Somewhere your arch-nemesis.
MARISHA: Fucking dick.

3215
02:19:23.760 --> 02:19:24.890
LIAM: As an eagle, I'm going to start looking

3216
02:19:24.890 --> 02:19:27.480
for any abnormal tree, anything larger than the rest,

3217
02:19:27.480 --> 02:19:31.090
anything that stands out as we fly forward.

3218
02:19:31.090 --> 02:19:32.260
MATT: Continuing.
LAURA: I had pointed out

3219
02:19:32.260 --> 02:19:34.760
the spires when we landed.
MATT: Yeah.

3220
02:19:34.760 --> 02:19:36.800
LAURA: So we can all--
MATT: Okay.

3221
02:19:36.800 --> 02:19:39.340
For the next hour of travel at full speed,

3222
02:19:41.692 --> 02:19:42.525
you're not going to be able to get to it,

3223
02:19:42.525 --> 02:19:43.630
you're still going to be a ways off from there, but

3224
02:19:43.630 --> 02:19:45.770
it's getting closer and now that she's pointed

3225
02:19:45.770 --> 02:19:47.070
it out to you and you guys continue onward,

3226
02:19:47.070 --> 02:19:49.290
you do begin to make out that element

3227
02:19:49.290 --> 02:19:51.470
of that transition in the canopy ahead.

3228
02:19:53.800 --> 02:19:56.000
You travel for the next hour or so.

3229
02:19:57.202 --> 02:19:58.318
That's cocked.

3230
02:19:59.430 --> 02:20:00.546
Again.

3231
02:20:02.614 --> 02:20:03.480
How did I do that three times in a row?

3232
02:20:03.480 --> 02:20:05.407
That's ridiculous, all right.

3233
02:20:07.810 --> 02:20:12.180
You continue onward towards the end of the second hour

3234
02:20:12.180 --> 02:20:16.599
as your Polymorph begins to threaten gradually (sputtering).

3235
02:20:16.599 --> 02:20:18.310
(laughter)

3236
02:20:18.310 --> 02:20:19.143
Begins to...

3237
02:20:20.682 --> 02:20:22.045
Oh, god.

3238
02:20:22.045 --> 02:20:24.411
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) Ah! Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!

3239
02:20:25.265 --> 02:20:26.678
MATT: You begin to descend once more,

3240
02:20:26.678 --> 02:20:28.320
looking for a gap in the canopy

3241
02:20:28.320 --> 02:20:30.040
around where you can safely land.

3242
02:20:30.040 --> 02:20:32.310
LAURA: Keeping an eye out for, you know, Laughing Hands or--

3243
02:20:32.310 --> 02:20:35.490
TRAVIS: Campfires, campfires.
LAURA: Campfires, anything scary.

3244
02:20:35.490 --> 02:20:37.100
MATT: Make one more perception check, I'll allow it.

3245
02:20:37.100 --> 02:20:38.470
TRAVIS: You want me to roll with you?

3246
02:20:38.470 --> 02:20:39.303
SAM: Yes.

3247
02:20:39.303 --> 02:20:40.136
TRAVIS: Okay.

3248
02:20:42.350 --> 02:20:44.522
Natural 20.
MARISHA: What the fuck?

3249
02:20:44.522 --> 02:20:45.360
MATT: Are you serious?

3250
02:20:45.360 --> 02:20:46.490
LIAM: Why can't you roll like that,

3251
02:20:46.490 --> 02:20:48.570
Marisha Ray?!
MARISHA: I don't know!

3252
02:20:48.570 --> 02:20:49.670
LAURA: 19 for me.

3253
02:20:49.670 --> 02:20:51.420
TRAVIS: 22.
MATT: Okay.

3254
02:20:51.420 --> 02:20:52.770
That was a total?

3255
02:20:52.770 --> 02:20:54.770
TRAVIS: The total, 22 is the total.

3256
02:20:54.770 --> 02:20:57.400
MATT: Okay, great, so as you're coming down into

3257
02:20:57.400 --> 02:21:00.090
the canopy and looking down, you're probably about,

3258
02:21:00.090 --> 02:21:01.210
you'd gather on foot,

3259
02:21:02.460 --> 02:21:05.480
another hour, hour and a half

3260
02:21:05.480 --> 02:21:09.602
of travel before you reach the edge of this grove.

3261
02:21:10.660 --> 02:21:13.120
And just as you're coming down to the canopy,

3262
02:21:13.120 --> 02:21:17.450
Fjord, you look down and see a faint little glow.

3263
02:21:17.450 --> 02:21:18.700
TRAVIS: Under us?
MATT: Under you.

3264
02:21:21.227 --> 02:21:22.660
TRAVIS: Fly up, keep going.

3265
02:21:22.660 --> 02:21:23.860
LAURA: I go up as much--

3266
02:21:23.860 --> 02:21:25.320
MATT: You have about a minute before it casts.

3267
02:21:25.320 --> 02:21:27.561
LAURA: I'm going to fly up and try to

3268
02:21:27.561 --> 02:21:28.944
get away from the thing.

3269
02:21:28.944 --> 02:21:31.350
MATT: Okay, as you pull up and pull up a bit,

3270
02:21:31.350 --> 02:21:33.140
you look and the canopy is too dense here.

3271
02:21:33.140 --> 02:21:35.000
Make a perception check to see if you can find a place safe

3272
02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:38.430
to land where the canopy isn't completely cluttered here.

3273
02:21:38.430 --> 02:21:40.030
You have now about--

3274
02:21:40.030 --> 02:21:40.863
LAURA: Oh, that was so cocked.

3275
02:21:40.863 --> 02:21:43.440
MATT: That was so cocked.
SAM: Ultra-cocked.

3276
02:21:43.440 --> 02:21:44.940
LIAM: Ultra-cocked.

3277
02:21:44.940 --> 02:21:47.470
SAM: Oh boy, it doesn't look good.

3278
02:21:47.470 --> 02:21:49.082
I can't really tell what it is.

3279
02:21:49.082 --> 02:21:50.832
LAURA: That's a natural one, y'all.

3280
02:21:50.832 --> 02:21:52.370
(laughter)

3281
02:21:52.370 --> 02:21:56.980
MATT: It is just dense, clustered trees and branches.

3282
02:21:56.980 --> 02:21:58.120
There is nowhere to land.

3283
02:21:58.120 --> 02:22:00.410
Other than the place you just were, you can't find a place.

3284
02:22:00.410 --> 02:22:02.870
You can try and just dive into it and take it

3285
02:22:02.870 --> 02:22:06.080
or you can try and push on.

3286
02:22:08.370 --> 02:22:11.472
SAM: Caduceus, this is so fun, isn't it?

3287
02:22:11.472 --> 02:22:12.790
TALIESIN: Oh, we're having a good time.

3288
02:22:12.790 --> 02:22:14.710
TRAVIS: Put distance between us and that thing.

3289
02:22:14.710 --> 02:22:16.620
LAURA: I'm going to just try to get as far away from that

3290
02:22:16.620 --> 02:22:20.630
as I can and get low on top of the canopies

3291
02:22:20.630 --> 02:22:22.980
and just hope that we can grab onto something.

3292
02:22:24.056 --> 02:22:26.550
LIAM: The eagle just has improv wings, just whoop.

3293
02:22:26.550 --> 02:22:27.383
MATT: Okay.

3294
02:22:27.383 --> 02:22:29.060
TALIESIN: You technically will know precisely the second

3295
02:22:29.060 --> 02:22:30.650
that it's about to go because
you have perfect sense of time.

3296
02:22:30.650 --> 02:22:32.090
LIAM: That's absolutely right.

3297
02:22:32.090 --> 02:22:35.611
LAURA: I just have the gas light on and I'm like (moaning).

3298
02:22:35.611 --> 02:22:37.550
(laughter)

3299
02:22:37.550 --> 02:22:39.770
MATT: That's exactly what it feels like

3300
02:22:39.770 --> 02:22:41.740
and you're not quite sure.
LIAM: But actually, I'm the eagle.

3301
02:22:41.740 --> 02:22:44.647
I'm not Caleb, so that's iffy whether--

3302
02:22:44.647 --> 02:22:46.380
TALIESIN: Hey.
LIAM: Yeah, I mean,

3303
02:22:46.380 --> 02:22:48.630
a moth chews on drapes, so.

3304
02:22:49.620 --> 02:22:51.130
MATT: Giant eagles are not--

3305
02:22:51.130 --> 02:22:55.010
LIAM: But does it have the Keen Mind feat that Caleb does?

3306
02:22:55.010 --> 02:22:56.930
MATT: I'll say--
TRAVIS: To know when it would end.

3307
02:22:56.930 --> 02:22:59.060
MATT: Well as casters, you know when it's going to end.

3308
02:22:59.060 --> 02:23:00.310
It isn't like you wonder.

3309
02:23:00.310 --> 02:23:01.580
LAURA: Oh, I can feel it.
MATT: But it's like,

3310
02:23:01.580 --> 02:23:03.060
you're in the last 30 seconds.

3311
02:23:03.060 --> 02:23:03.893
LAURA and LIAM: Okay.

3312
02:23:03.893 --> 02:23:07.576
MATT: You're like, "Do I try and land safely or safer

3313
02:23:07.576 --> 02:23:09.426
"now or just continue to push on until it runs out?"

3314
02:23:09.426 --> 02:23:10.630
What are you doing?
TALIESIN: That's four rounds.

3315
02:23:10.630 --> 02:23:13.290
You're going to go far in four rounds, I'm just saying.

3316
02:23:13.290 --> 02:23:17.880
LAURA: I'm going to push on until the last six seconds,

3317
02:23:17.880 --> 02:23:19.620
then I'm going to try to find a landing.

3318
02:23:19.620 --> 02:23:21.320
LIAM: Yeah, Caleb actually eggs her on

3319
02:23:21.320 --> 02:23:23.270
with his eyes as an eagle.

3320
02:23:23.270 --> 02:23:25.710
MARISHA: Put on my goggles.

3321
02:23:25.710 --> 02:23:26.630
Hunker down.

3322
02:23:27.694 --> 02:23:28.900
MATT: You can see now.
MARISHA: Here we go!

3323
02:23:28.900 --> 02:23:30.490
MATT: Both birds are going into a dive

3324
02:23:30.490 --> 02:23:32.270
and coasting right over the top.

3325
02:23:32.270 --> 02:23:33.460
As you guys are holding on,

3326
02:23:33.460 --> 02:23:35.148
you can feel, yeah, bridges.

3327
02:23:35.148 --> 02:23:36.270
(smacking)

3328
02:23:36.270 --> 02:23:37.960
Like higher bows are starting to scrape

3329
02:23:37.960 --> 02:23:39.770
the bottoms of your feet and whip past you.

3330
02:23:39.770 --> 02:23:43.050
TRAVIS: Fuck, fuck, fuck.

3331
02:23:43.050 --> 02:23:44.240
MATT: You did roll a one, unfortunately,

3332
02:23:44.240 --> 02:23:48.020
and you cannot find any place that looks safe to land.

3333
02:23:48.020 --> 02:23:48.950
You're either going to have to push into

3334
02:23:48.950 --> 02:23:50.750
one of the canopies or you're just going to

3335
02:23:50.750 --> 02:23:52.960
lose control as you're all moving at maximum speed flying.

3336
02:23:52.960 --> 02:23:54.410
LAURA: I'm going to wait for the last

3337
02:23:55.690 --> 02:23:57.330
10 seconds, then push down at the canopy.

3338
02:23:57.330 --> 02:23:58.470
MATT: And then just jump out of the airplane

3339
02:23:58.470 --> 02:23:59.530
at the last minute and you'll be fine?

3340
02:23:59.530 --> 02:24:01.140
LAURA: Just like push out of--
LIAM: To slow your velocity.

3341
02:24:01.140 --> 02:24:03.940
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to start to
slow in the last 10 seconds.

3342
02:24:03.940 --> 02:24:08.940
But yeah, I'm going to try to push it right to the edge.

3343
02:24:08.950 --> 02:24:09.900
MATT: Okay.

3344
02:24:09.900 --> 02:24:11.630
All right, and right as you do,

3345
02:24:11.630 --> 02:24:12.800
you get to the very, very edge.

3346
02:24:12.800 --> 02:24:14.460
TRAVIS: Kill power.
MATT: You slope it and--

3347
02:24:14.460 --> 02:24:15.910
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

3348
02:24:15.910 --> 02:24:17.510
MATT: Both of you lose your forms.

3349
02:24:18.550 --> 02:24:20.010
LIAM: Caleb reaches into his coat

3350
02:24:20.010 --> 02:24:21.350
and pulls out a piece of feathery down

3351
02:24:21.350 --> 02:24:24.190
and casts Feather Fall on everybody except Fjord.

3352
02:24:24.190 --> 02:24:26.080
MARISHA: No, no, no, get Fjord, get Fjord.

3353
02:24:26.080 --> 02:24:27.090
MATT: No, too late.
LIAM: Too late.

3354
02:24:27.090 --> 02:24:29.090
Everybody but Fjord, there's only so many people I can get.

3355
02:24:29.090 --> 02:24:30.750
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's fine.
LIAM: He's beefy cake now.

3356
02:24:30.750 --> 02:24:32.260
SAM: I'll cast Feather Fall on him.

3357
02:24:32.260 --> 02:24:33.800
LAURA: Yay.

3358
02:24:33.800 --> 02:24:34.633
MATT: Okay.

3359
02:24:36.930 --> 02:24:38.110
So,

3360
02:24:38.110 --> 02:24:41.000
you all poof, appear

3361
02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:41.833
and

3362
02:24:42.850 --> 02:24:44.710
it takes six seconds to cast a spell.

3363
02:24:44.710 --> 02:24:45.700
SAM: Oh shit.

3364
02:24:45.700 --> 02:24:46.690
MATT: It's a reaction though, right?

3365
02:24:46.690 --> 02:24:49.150
Feather Fall's a reaction, so no, it is a lot quicker.

3366
02:24:49.150 --> 02:24:50.390
LAURA: Thank god.

3367
02:24:50.390 --> 02:24:51.490
TALIESIN: Expelliarmus.
MATT: That's right.

3368
02:24:51.490 --> 02:24:53.210
(laughter)

3369
02:24:53.210 --> 02:24:56.040
MATT: As you guys are toppling even at a slower speed,

3370
02:24:56.040 --> 02:24:58.680
in order to try and slow down at the speed you were

3371
02:24:58.680 --> 02:25:01.660
careening at, you're still moving at a pretty decent pace

3372
02:25:01.660 --> 02:25:05.220
before all of a sudden, you all begin to tumble in the air.

3373
02:25:05.220 --> 02:25:09.220
Two Feather Falls release and you all begin to gently hit

3374
02:25:10.350 --> 02:25:12.430
boughs and branches, you don't take any damage.

3375
02:25:12.430 --> 02:25:14.650
MARISHA: Swipe it away.
TRAVIS: If we can see each other,

3376
02:25:14.650 --> 02:25:16.650
I'm holding up this and going to be like...

3377
02:25:17.670 --> 02:25:19.470
MATT: You guys are hitting like (swooshing),

3378
02:25:19.470 --> 02:25:22.550
like moving through the trees and plummeting down.

3379
02:25:22.550 --> 02:25:24.360
You're not taking damage, which is the good news.

3380
02:25:24.360 --> 02:25:25.193
LAURA: Yeah.

3381
02:25:25.193 --> 02:25:26.090
MATT: But you're like--

3382
02:25:26.090 --> 02:25:27.550
LAURA: We're trying to stealthily fall.

3383
02:25:27.550 --> 02:25:31.470
MATT: Yeah, like you know when parachuters come into trees?

3384
02:25:31.470 --> 02:25:32.303
MARISHA: Yeah.

3385
02:25:32.303 --> 02:25:33.600
MATT: Like it doesn't kill them instantly.

3386
02:25:33.600 --> 02:25:35.220
They don't all of a sudden come out of it

3387
02:25:35.220 --> 02:25:37.761
horribly thrashed unless they did a really bad,

3388
02:25:37.761 --> 02:25:39.462
but it's not fun and it's not quiet.

3389
02:25:39.462 --> 02:25:41.231
LIAM: We look super stupid.
MATT: Yeah.

3390
02:25:41.231 --> 02:25:43.110
TRAVIS: Are we falling at 15 miles an hour like parachuters?

3391
02:25:43.110 --> 02:25:43.943
LAURA: The usual.

3392
02:25:43.943 --> 02:25:46.600
SAM: It's 60 feet a second or something like that.

3393
02:25:46.600 --> 02:25:48.460
No, no, 60 feet a round, 60 feet a round.

3394
02:25:48.460 --> 02:25:50.110
So it's 10 feet a second.
TALIESIN: 10 feet a second.

3395
02:25:50.110 --> 02:25:51.470
LIAM: 60 feet per round.

3396
02:25:51.470 --> 02:25:53.920
MATT: Yeah, it's landing a parachute.

3397
02:25:53.920 --> 02:25:56.330
So you guys are (swooshing)

3398
02:25:56.330 --> 02:25:59.240
through the boughs and the branches.

3399
02:25:59.240 --> 02:26:00.840
I need everyone to go ahead

3400
02:26:00.840 --> 02:26:02.990
and make an acrobatics check for me, please.

3401
02:26:05.916 --> 02:26:07.390
LIAM: Oh god. That dice is gone.

3402
02:26:08.245 --> 02:26:09.966
MARISHA: Fucking piece of shit.

3403
02:26:09.966 --> 02:26:10.803
LIAM: Yes.

3404
02:26:10.803 --> 02:26:13.500
SAM: Are we exhausted yet?

3405
02:26:13.500 --> 02:26:15.590
TALIESIN: You don't know.
TRAVIS: 15.

3406
02:26:15.590 --> 02:26:16.423
MARISHA: 15.

3407
02:26:16.423 --> 02:26:17.980
TALIESIN: I could have given myself--

3408
02:26:17.980 --> 02:26:19.940
LAURA: I did, I gave it to myself.
TALIESIN: Okay.

3409
02:26:19.940 --> 02:26:22.520
MATT: Fucking Guidance.
LIAM: 19.

3410
02:26:22.520 --> 02:26:23.590
MATT: 19.
SAM: 15.

3411
02:26:23.590 --> 02:26:24.890
LAURA: 14.

3412
02:26:24.890 --> 02:26:25.970
TALIESIN: 14.

3413
02:26:25.970 --> 02:26:27.010
LIAM: Highest.
MATT: Okay.

3414
02:26:27.860 --> 02:26:30.580
None of you take a heavy branch to the chest.

3415
02:26:32.630 --> 02:26:33.790
TRAVIS: Man.

3416
02:26:33.790 --> 02:26:35.420
MATT: You pop, pop, pop, pop, getting hit around

3417
02:26:35.420 --> 02:26:36.960
and eventually coast to the point

3418
02:26:36.960 --> 02:26:38.940
where you break through the bottom part of the canopy

3419
02:26:38.940 --> 02:26:41.340
before coming to a rest on your feet.

3420
02:26:41.340 --> 02:26:43.180
It's still a hard landing, like an oof.

3421
02:26:43.180 --> 02:26:46.070
You still impact, you have to tumble a bit

3422
02:26:46.070 --> 02:26:48.170
and then catch yourselves skidding to a halt.

3423
02:26:48.170 --> 02:26:51.970
A couple of you bump into a tree hard with a shoulder.

3424
02:26:51.970 --> 02:26:53.240
It's probably going to bruise, but not enough

3425
02:26:53.240 --> 02:26:55.710
to actually physically damage yourself.

3426
02:26:55.710 --> 02:26:57.260
But you all come to stop

3427
02:26:57.260 --> 02:27:00.270
scattered a bit amongst the base of the forest.

3428
02:27:00.270 --> 02:27:01.800
TRAVIS: Can I spin on my heel and turn

3429
02:27:01.800 --> 02:27:03.970
in the direction that I saw the campfire and just look?

3430
02:27:03.970 --> 02:27:04.950
LAURA: Yeah, listen.
TRAVIS: Can I see?

3431
02:27:04.950 --> 02:27:06.850
TALIESIN: Listening for laughter.

3432
02:27:06.850 --> 02:27:07.710
MATT: All right.

3433
02:27:07.710 --> 02:27:10.950
Go ahead and make perception checks, the two of you.

3434
02:27:10.950 --> 02:27:12.190
LAURA: I'm going to cast

3435
02:27:13.400 --> 02:27:15.540
Pass Without a Trace on everyone right now.

3436
02:27:16.810 --> 02:27:18.790
SAM: Yes, thank you.
TRAVIS: Natural 19.

3437
02:27:18.790 --> 02:27:19.840
TALIESIN: 21.

3438
02:27:19.840 --> 02:27:20.790
MATT: 21.

3439
02:27:23.150 --> 02:27:25.530
You listen carefully and look out there.

3440
02:27:29.570 --> 02:27:31.050
Nothing.

3441
02:27:31.050 --> 02:27:33.120
TRAVIS: (whispering) I saw them, I saw the campfire.

3442
02:27:33.120 --> 02:27:34.907
MATT: You listen as they're all laying.

3443
02:27:38.297 --> 02:27:42.993
(plodding)

3444
02:27:42.993 --> 02:27:44.588
LAURA: Getting louder?
MATT: (louder plodding)

3445
02:27:44.588 --> 02:27:46.680
TALIESIN: Run, run, run, run.

3446
02:27:46.680 --> 02:27:48.341
LAURA: Fucking stealthy.

3447
02:27:48.341 --> 02:27:50.450
MATT: Are you guys going stealthily
or are you moving quickly?

3448
02:27:50.450 --> 02:27:52.440
ALL: Stealthy.

3449
02:27:52.440 --> 02:27:55.560
MATT: Okay, so it's slower speed, that's pretty slow speed.

3450
02:27:55.560 --> 02:27:57.860
Everyone go ahead and make a standard stealth check.

3451
02:27:57.860 --> 02:27:58.860
LAURA: Plus 10, you guys.

3452
02:27:58.860 --> 02:28:00.630
TRAVIS: (repeatedly) Did they hear us?

3453
02:28:00.630 --> 02:28:02.310
MARISHA: He had to have heard us, right?

3454
02:28:02.310 --> 02:28:03.160
LIAM: Roll.

3455
02:28:03.160 --> 02:28:05.320
LARUA: Maybe. Blessing of the Trickster.

3456
02:28:05.320 --> 02:28:07.450
Blessing of the Trickster.

3457
02:28:07.450 --> 02:28:09.040
So you get advantage on your stealth roll.

3458
02:28:09.040 --> 02:28:11.010
TALIESIN: On my stealth, okay.
TRAVIS: 25.

3459
02:28:11.010 --> 02:28:11.920
LIAM: You dick.
TALIESIN: Plus 10.

3460
02:28:11.920 --> 02:28:13.670
LIAM: What's your problem?
LAURA: Guide me.

3461
02:28:16.101 --> 02:28:17.960
TRAVIS: You better get your ass in gear.

3462
02:28:17.960 --> 02:28:19.280
MARISHA: I rolled a three,

3463
02:28:19.280 --> 02:28:21.433
but plus nine for my stealth.
MATT: We got to get you new dice.

3464
02:28:21.433 --> 02:28:23.990
MARISHA: For my stealth which is 12 plus 10, so 22.

3465
02:28:23.990 --> 02:28:25.280
SAM: Oh yeah, that's actually not terrible.

3466
02:28:25.280 --> 02:28:27.974
MATT: For a three to a, jeez.

3467
02:28:27.974 --> 02:28:31.050
MARISHA: But I haven't rolled above a six
pretty much all game.

3468
02:28:31.050 --> 02:28:32.440
MATT: I know.

3469
02:28:32.440 --> 02:28:33.380
MARISHA: I rolled a 17 on that

3470
02:28:33.380 --> 02:28:35.640
perception check that was not for me.

3471
02:28:35.640 --> 02:28:37.670
It was not my perception check.

3472
02:28:37.670 --> 02:28:38.690
Keep going.

3473
02:28:38.690 --> 02:28:40.940
LIAM: Well I rolled an 18, so 30.

3474
02:28:40.940 --> 02:28:42.170
SAM: 41.

3475
02:28:42.170 --> 02:28:43.070
LAURA: 35.

3476
02:28:43.070 --> 02:28:44.510
TALIESIN: 25.

3477
02:28:44.510 --> 02:28:46.960
MATT: All right.
LIAM: Yeah, 40s.

3478
02:28:46.960 --> 02:28:49.970
MATT: So you guys are carefully, quietly

3479
02:28:49.970 --> 02:28:52.770
moving through in the direction of where the forest was.

3480
02:28:56.333 --> 02:28:58.817
(low cackling)

3481
02:28:58.817 --> 02:28:59.836
(thumping)

3482
02:28:59.836 --> 02:29:01.950
LAURA: Oh god, should we take him?
LIAM: No.

3483
02:29:01.950 --> 02:29:03.914
MATT: (thudding)

3484
02:29:03.914 --> 02:29:05.250
(crackling)

3485
02:29:05.250 --> 02:29:07.300
You hear branches break and shatter.

3486
02:29:07.300 --> 02:29:10.730
You hear (crackling) a nearby smaller tree

3487
02:29:12.020 --> 02:29:14.080
topples over amongst others.

3488
02:29:14.080 --> 02:29:18.570
The heavy sound cracking as you hear (cackling).

3489
02:29:18.570 --> 02:29:19.720
Shifting laughs that fade.

3490
02:29:19.720 --> 02:29:22.580
MARISHA: Just cover your ears, cover your ears.

3491
02:29:22.580 --> 02:29:24.720
LAURA: Everybody covers their ears.

3492
02:29:24.720 --> 02:29:27.470
MATT: Then silence.

3493
02:29:27.470 --> 02:29:30.310
(low cackling)

3494
02:29:30.310 --> 02:29:32.845
Are you guys stopping or are you continuing to move?

3495
02:29:32.845 --> 02:29:33.928
SAM: We got to keep going.
LAURA: We're being quiet.

3496
02:29:33.928 --> 02:29:36.076
SAM: Keep going.
MARISHA: Should we just wait and hide?

3497
02:29:36.076 --> 02:29:37.011
SAM: Just wait.

3498
02:29:37.011 --> 02:29:38.839
LAURA: We're going to wait.

3499
02:29:38.839 --> 02:29:40.386
MARISHA: We're hiding.

3500
02:29:40.386 --> 02:29:41.652
MATT: You're hiding?
LIAM: Yeah.

3501
02:29:41.652 --> 02:29:46.652
MATT: All right.

3502
02:29:49.058 --> 02:29:51.610
(crackling)

3503
02:29:51.610 --> 02:29:55.600
You see wandering about 15 feet off through

3504
02:29:55.600 --> 02:29:58.280
the forest the hulking shape of the Laughing Hand.

3505
02:30:02.510 --> 02:30:06.260
Slashes through this large cluster of tangled net-like

3506
02:30:06.260 --> 02:30:10.137
vines that just all of a sudden flap onto the ground.

3507
02:30:10.137 --> 02:30:11.661
(thudding)

3508
02:30:11.661 --> 02:30:14.229
And with each step, you hear like four of five weird,

3509
02:30:14.229 --> 02:30:17.810
swirling laughs, (cackling).

3510
02:30:17.810 --> 02:30:21.020
TRAVIS: Can I in this moment of quick breath, can I use

3511
02:30:21.020 --> 02:30:25.720
Divine Sense to keep tabs on him, it, that thing?

3512
02:30:25.720 --> 02:30:27.220
MARISHA: Oh my god, yes.

3513
02:30:27.220 --> 02:30:28.520
Put that tracking beacon--
MATT: Divine Sense is,

3514
02:30:28.520 --> 02:30:30.720
what's the range on that?
TRAVIS: 60 feet.

3515
02:30:30.720 --> 02:30:33.090
Celestial, fiend, undead within 60 feet.

3516
02:30:33.090 --> 02:30:35.750
MATT: All right, yeah, you immediately blip as you focus.

3517
02:30:35.750 --> 02:30:37.160
For the first time since you were

3518
02:30:37.160 --> 02:30:39.350
given this blessing from the Wildmother,

3519
02:30:39.350 --> 02:30:42.190
you close your eyes and you feel this searing,

3520
02:30:42.190 --> 02:30:43.640
burning sensation to the immediate

3521
02:30:43.640 --> 02:30:45.460
right of where the Laughing Hand is

3522
02:30:45.460 --> 02:30:49.268
and a second one about 50 feet behind you.

3523
02:30:50.170 --> 02:30:51.003
SAM: What is that?

3524
02:30:51.850 --> 02:30:52.970
MARISHA: Is that Obann?
TRAVIS: Shh.

3525
02:30:54.360 --> 02:30:57.628
There's something behind us about 50 feet.

3526
02:30:57.628 --> 02:31:00.284
MATT: (loud thudding)

3527
02:31:00.284 --> 02:31:01.117
(low growling)

3528
02:31:01.117 --> 02:31:02.500
You see the Laughing Hand turn around

3529
02:31:02.500 --> 02:31:04.400
and look back from where it came from.

3530
02:31:09.029 --> 02:31:10.904
(thudding)

3531
02:31:10.904 --> 02:31:13.280
And begins marching in the direction you guys were traveling

3532
02:31:14.390 --> 02:31:16.360
and in the direction of where you are,

3533
02:31:16.360 --> 02:31:17.940
you can see following in the path

3534
02:31:17.940 --> 02:31:21.190
of the Laughing Hand, Obann and Yasha

3535
02:31:21.190 --> 02:31:23.673
also now continuing their trek.

3536
02:31:26.287 --> 02:31:27.880
SAM: Wait, are they heading back to their camp or--

3537
02:31:27.880 --> 02:31:29.147
LAURA: No.

3538
02:31:29.147 --> 02:31:30.380
TRAVIS: Where we're headed.

3539
02:31:30.380 --> 02:31:32.680
SAM: We're walking with them now?

3540
02:31:32.680 --> 02:31:33.513
LIAM: Yes.

3541
02:31:33.513 --> 02:31:35.660
SAM: This is the worst thing that could've happened.

3542
02:31:36.820 --> 02:31:38.040
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

3543
02:31:38.040 --> 02:31:39.331
LAURA: Why?

3544
02:31:41.096 --> 02:31:43.332
MARISHA: You know when you say goodbye to someone too soon?

3545
02:31:45.385 --> 02:31:47.494
LAURA: Oh god, I'm really warm.

3546
02:31:47.494 --> 02:31:48.327
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

3547
02:31:48.327 --> 02:31:49.510
TRAVIS: But if we've started running,

3548
02:31:49.510 --> 02:31:53.350
Obann was in the direction we were heading, right?

3549
02:31:53.350 --> 02:31:55.498
MATT: Obann was behind you guys.

3550
02:31:55.498 --> 02:31:56.789
The Laughing Hand was a little bit ahead,

3551
02:31:56.789 --> 02:31:58.420
he was now marching that direction and it looks like

3552
02:31:58.420 --> 02:32:00.880
Yasha and Obann were slowly catching up from behind.

3553
02:32:00.880 --> 02:32:02.810
LAURA: So we see them now, we see Obann and Yasha now,

3554
02:32:02.810 --> 02:32:03.820
passing us?
MATT: You guys don't see them.

3555
02:32:03.820 --> 02:32:05.870
You've noticed and glance over

3556
02:32:05.870 --> 02:32:07.950
your shoulder and see about 50 feet behind.

3557
02:32:10.169 --> 02:32:12.607
(laughter)

3558
02:32:12.607 --> 02:32:14.940
TRAVIS: We should give a berth, like a wide berth, but

3559
02:32:14.940 --> 02:32:16.570
we need to mirror them to this thing.

3560
02:32:16.570 --> 02:32:17.860
We need to watch and see what's happening.

3561
02:32:17.860 --> 02:32:19.442
SAM: With them?

3562
02:32:19.442 --> 02:32:20.275
LAURA: Grab the skull off of Obann as he walks by.

3563
02:32:20.275 --> 02:32:22.186
SAM: Maybe we should go to plan two.

3564
02:32:22.186 --> 02:32:24.764
MARISHA: Yeah, I think we should go to plan two.

3565
02:32:24.764 --> 02:32:25.990
He's here--

3566
02:32:25.990 --> 02:32:27.740
SAM: We're not going to get there before them.

3567
02:32:27.740 --> 02:32:28.573
MARISHA: Fuck no.

3568
02:32:29.420 --> 02:32:30.520
SAM: So we got to go to plan two.

3569
02:32:30.520 --> 02:32:35.520
MARISHA: Yeah, we just pace alongside of them for a bit.

3570
02:32:35.560 --> 02:32:38.070
Knock into the plan and then we could just like,

3571
02:32:38.070 --> 02:32:40.030
like Tie Fighters just--
SAM: They are awake and walking

3572
02:32:40.030 --> 02:32:42.920
now, this isn't like sneaking up on someone who's asleep.

3573
02:32:42.920 --> 02:32:44.853
MARISHA: It's like a moving train mission,

3574
02:32:44.853 --> 02:32:46.200
like jump on it and go.

3575
02:32:46.200 --> 02:32:49.796
TRAVIS: Can demons see things that are invisible?

3576
02:32:49.796 --> 02:32:51.974
Anybody know?

3577
02:32:51.974 --> 02:32:53.180
Anybody know, do you know?

3578
02:32:53.180 --> 02:32:54.032
You read books.

3579
02:32:54.032 --> 02:32:56.320
LIAM: Have I read anything in a book on demons?

3580
02:32:56.320 --> 02:32:59.040
MATT: You could make a religion check, if you'd like.

3581
02:32:59.040 --> 02:33:01.240
MARISHA: Can I do that, too?
MATT: Sure.

3582
02:33:01.240 --> 02:33:05.420
TRAVIS: Fuck, what did you roll?

3583
02:33:05.420 --> 02:33:07.120
LIAM: 11, super low.
MATT: Okay.

3584
02:33:07.120 --> 02:33:09.890
MARISHA: Bullshit for me, too. 17, but--

3585
02:33:09.890 --> 02:33:10.910
LIAM: That's a big ask.

3586
02:33:10.910 --> 02:33:12.080
MATT: That's great.

3587
02:33:12.080 --> 02:33:13.240
TALIESIN: 12.

3588
02:33:14.430 --> 02:33:17.310
MATT: In your studies with different celestial

3589
02:33:17.310 --> 02:33:20.450
and-or fiendish entities that have a modicum

3590
02:33:20.450 --> 02:33:24.480
of power and station over lesser versions of themselves,

3591
02:33:24.480 --> 02:33:28.520
some of them can and often do see things that

3592
02:33:28.520 --> 02:33:31.720
have been cloaked for the sense of personal preservation.

3593
02:33:33.120 --> 02:33:35.830
Both in devilish and demonic circles,

3594
02:33:37.680 --> 02:33:39.440
lesser entities are always looking to undercut each other.

3595
02:33:39.440 --> 02:33:40.350
To rise up in station,

3596
02:33:40.350 --> 02:33:42.250
especially when in comes to devils as well.

3597
02:33:42.250 --> 02:33:43.083
So some do.

3598
02:33:44.750 --> 02:33:45.583
Not all of them do.

3599
02:33:45.583 --> 02:33:47.650
LIAM: Super concrete info.

3600
02:33:47.650 --> 02:33:48.483
LAURA: Hey.

3601
02:33:48.483 --> 02:33:49.570
MARISHA: It's a fucking coin toss.

3602
02:33:53.835 --> 02:33:56.080
SAM: I mean--
MATT: Obann (swooshing).

3603
02:33:56.080 --> 02:33:59.230
He flies up and lands up in a tree and looks around.

3604
02:33:59.230 --> 02:34:00.063
MARISHA: Ooh, shit.

3605
02:34:05.460 --> 02:34:07.320
MATT: Looks up at where all the branches have broken.

3606
02:34:07.320 --> 02:34:08.490
SAM: Oh, shit.

3607
02:34:13.550 --> 02:34:15.770
MATT: Follows the eyeline of where they broke

3608
02:34:15.770 --> 02:34:18.170
and the impacts in the dirt where you guys were.

3609
02:34:19.501 --> 02:34:21.517
LAURA: Start casting your Teleportation Circle!

3610
02:34:21.517 --> 02:34:23.767
(laughter)

3611
02:34:24.778 --> 02:34:25.769
LIAM: I don't think so.

3612
02:34:25.769 --> 02:34:27.050
LAURA: Do it and then just run up and grab

3613
02:34:27.050 --> 02:34:28.665
the skull and run away.
TRAVIS: We don't have 10 minutes.

3614
02:34:28.665 --> 02:34:29.590
MATT: "Orphan Maker,"

3615
02:34:29.590 --> 02:34:33.081
and he points in the direction of where you guys are.

3616
02:34:33.081 --> 02:34:35.040
LAURA: Where we are.
MATT: Of where you guys landed.

3617
02:34:35.040 --> 02:34:36.960
You guys have probably moved and hid off to the side,

3618
02:34:36.960 --> 02:34:39.760
but you can see now they're piecing together--

3619
02:34:39.760 --> 02:34:41.360
MARISHA: What did he say, what, what did he say?

3620
02:34:41.360 --> 02:34:43.570
TRAVIS: If he sends Orphan Maker, you go.

3621
02:34:43.570 --> 02:34:44.990
SAM: He's just said Orphan Maker.

3622
02:34:44.990 --> 02:34:47.710
TRAVIS: Yeah, if he sends Orphan Maker,
then he's by himself.

3623
02:34:47.710 --> 02:34:48.620
LAURA: Yeah, but he's in the air.

3624
02:34:48.620 --> 02:34:49.580
SAM: He's on a tree, but--

3625
02:34:49.580 --> 02:34:50.413
TRAVIS: You can't climb a fucking tree?

3626
02:34:50.413 --> 02:34:52.000
SAM: Sure, I can climb a fucking tree.

3627
02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.100
LAURA: What, what, what?

3628
02:34:54.100 --> 02:34:57.940
SAM: Invisible climbing and stealing, sure.

3629
02:34:57.940 --> 02:34:58.780
TRAVIS: Chug.

3630
02:34:58.780 --> 02:35:00.020
MARISHA: Do it, do it, do it.

3631
02:35:01.912 --> 02:35:02.745
TALIESIN: This is such a bad idea.

3632
02:35:02.745 --> 02:35:04.910
LAURA: I cannot believe you just suggested this.

3633
02:35:04.910 --> 02:35:06.460
SAM: I'll go invisi-- I'll go--

3634
02:35:06.460 --> 02:35:08.900
TRAVIS: I didn't want to do this, I wanted to play it safe.

3635
02:35:08.900 --> 02:35:10.980
But guess what, we're here now.

3636
02:35:10.980 --> 02:35:13.900
SAM: How far away he?
LAURA: You've still got Pass Without a Trace.

3637
02:35:13.900 --> 02:35:15.260
SAM: Will that last even if I walk away?

3638
02:35:15.260 --> 02:35:16.650
LAURA: No.

3639
02:35:16.650 --> 02:35:17.483
SAM: Great.

3640
02:35:17.483 --> 02:35:19.130
LAURA: If you're within like 30 feet, 60 feet, 30 feet.

3641
02:35:19.130 --> 02:35:20.970
SAM: I'm not going to be that close.

3642
02:35:20.970 --> 02:35:23.100
How far is his tree from us?

3643
02:35:23.100 --> 02:35:26.710
MATT: His tree, he's probably about 45 feet up in the tree,

3644
02:35:26.710 --> 02:35:28.600
about 40 feet up the tree.

3645
02:35:28.600 --> 02:35:31.380
SAM: How far is the base of the tree from where we are?

3646
02:35:31.380 --> 02:35:32.340
MATT: The base of the tree,

3647
02:35:32.340 --> 02:35:35.190
from where you guys are right now, I'd say about 60 feet.

3648
02:35:36.060 --> 02:35:37.080
SAM: Okay.

3649
02:35:37.080 --> 02:35:38.450
MARISHA: That's where the Laughing Hand is?

3650
02:35:38.450 --> 02:35:39.730
You're trying to go after the Laughing Hand, right?

3651
02:35:39.730 --> 02:35:43.010
LAURA: No, he's trying to go after
Obann in the top of a tree.

3652
02:35:43.010 --> 02:35:44.100
MARISHA: Wait, why, why is Obann?

3653
02:35:44.100 --> 02:35:46.400
SAM: To get the heart and soul--
LAURA: Obann has the skull.

3654
02:35:46.400 --> 02:35:47.770
Not Laughing Hand.

3655
02:35:47.770 --> 02:35:49.230
LAURA: Obann's got the skull.

3656
02:35:49.230 --> 02:35:51.550
MARISHA: Oh, it's Obann. I thought it was on Laughing Hand.

3657
02:35:51.550 --> 02:35:52.720
MATT: You can still hear the Laughing Hand is

3658
02:35:52.720 --> 02:35:55.290
ahead of you guys and is like just circling,

3659
02:35:55.290 --> 02:35:56.660
looking around and waiting for the others to catch up.

3660
02:35:56.660 --> 02:35:57.900
LIAM: I have a quick spatial question.

3661
02:35:57.900 --> 02:35:59.050
MATT: Yes?

3662
02:35:59.050 --> 02:36:00.980
LIAM: How far away is the Laughing Hand?

3663
02:36:00.980 --> 02:36:03.784
Obann is like 60 feet away.
MATT: Let's pull up a map.

3664
02:36:03.784 --> 02:36:06.790
(screaming)

3665
02:36:06.790 --> 02:36:11.790
TRAVIS: (continues screaming)

3666
02:36:12.971 --> 02:36:14.270
SAM: Dwarven Forge.

3667
02:36:15.290 --> 02:36:16.230
Oh fuck.

3668
02:36:17.360 --> 02:36:19.050
This combat, is it combat?

3669
02:36:19.050 --> 02:36:21.730
God, I hope not, is powered by Dwarven Forge.

3670
02:36:21.730 --> 02:36:24.938
I hope they do not power this combat.

3671
02:36:24.938 --> 02:36:27.400
Check out the latest and greatest--
MATT: Three pieces of Dwarven Forge on there.

3672
02:36:27.400 --> 02:36:30.670
SAM: Check out the latest and greatest at dwarvenforge.com.

3673
02:36:30.670 --> 02:36:32.051
TALIESIN: I am not okay with this.

3674
02:36:32.051 --> 02:36:34.270
LIAM: This is such a terrible idea, but Marisha

3675
02:36:34.270 --> 02:36:35.670
and I have been whispering all night about how--

3676
02:36:35.670 --> 02:36:37.200
LAURA: Not with my spells that I don't have.

3677
02:36:37.200 --> 02:36:39.720
LIAM and MARISHA: Being horny for combat.

3678
02:36:39.720 --> 02:36:42.890
MARISHA: Yeah, we've had a dry spell.

3679
02:36:42.890 --> 02:36:44.630
SAM: These trees are amazing.

3680
02:36:44.630 --> 02:36:46.070
MATT: So,

3681
02:36:46.070 --> 02:36:48.232
you guys.
MARISHA: Give it to me.

3682
02:36:48.232 --> 02:36:49.090
MATT: We'll say for the purposes of this--

3683
02:36:49.090 --> 02:36:50.950
SAM: How did you know we would land here?

3684
02:36:50.950 --> 02:36:52.820
MATT: Well no, I have a series of things

3685
02:36:52.820 --> 02:36:54.360
I can adjust based on where it happens.

3686
02:36:54.360 --> 02:36:55.500
TRAVIS: He has so many things back around--

3687
02:36:55.500 --> 02:36:57.630
MATT: I have a bunch of maps based on what happened tonight

3688
02:36:57.630 --> 02:37:00.320
that can be repurposed depending on where it happened.

3689
02:37:01.538 --> 02:37:02.371
LIAM: Improvisation.

3690
02:37:02.371 --> 02:37:04.640
MATT: You guys, we'll say have all

3691
02:37:04.640 --> 02:37:06.920
found your ways to hide in this vicinity.

3692
02:37:06.920 --> 02:37:08.030
You can tell me where specifically

3693
02:37:08.030 --> 02:37:10.242
you would have gone to hide if you want to.

3694
02:37:10.242 --> 02:37:11.570
TRAVIS: It depends on where they are.

3695
02:37:11.570 --> 02:37:13.430
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SAM: Also, where did we land?

3696
02:37:13.430 --> 02:37:15.510
Where's our impact craters?

3697
02:37:15.510 --> 02:37:16.343
Okay.

3698
02:37:17.664 --> 02:37:19.270
TRAVIS: And they came from this direction?

3699
02:37:19.270 --> 02:37:21.470
LAURA: This is, really, there's only these trees?

3700
02:37:21.470 --> 02:37:24.330
MATT: Obann is up in here.
LAURA: Oh god.

3701
02:37:24.330 --> 02:37:25.700
Where's Yasha?

3702
02:37:25.700 --> 02:37:28.030
MATT: The Laughing Hand is a ways--

3703
02:37:28.030 --> 02:37:29.898
LIAM: No.
MATT: In this space somewhere.

3704
02:37:29.898 --> 02:37:31.180
LAURA: Oh god, I'm going to cry.

3705
02:37:31.180 --> 02:37:32.991
MARISHA: So ahead of us, ahead of us.

3706
02:37:32.991 --> 02:37:34.220
LIAM: He's so big.
MARISHA: Right.

3707
02:37:34.220 --> 02:37:36.290
MATT: And Yasha's over here.

3708
02:37:36.290 --> 02:37:37.123
LAURA: Poor Yasha.

3709
02:37:38.690 --> 02:37:39.900
LIAM: Anime yell, "Yasha!"

3710
02:37:43.022 --> 02:37:44.060
MATT: So what are you guys doing?

3711
02:37:44.060 --> 02:37:45.240
LAURA: Crying.

3712
02:37:45.240 --> 02:37:48.226
I'm literally crying crouching down.

3713
02:37:48.226 --> 02:37:49.059
MARISHA: All right, Nott.

3714
02:37:49.059 --> 02:37:50.940
TRAVIS: Is that all the cover there is?

3715
02:37:50.940 --> 02:37:53.300
MARISHA: I think this can fucking work.

3716
02:37:53.300 --> 02:37:55.180
You go after Obann.
SAM: Yeah.

3717
02:37:55.180 --> 02:37:58.206
MATT: All of this is forest, though.
SAM: You distract, you fight.

3718
02:37:58.206 --> 02:37:59.039
MARISHA: 100%.

3719
02:37:59.039 --> 02:38:00.848
And as soon, try it because

3720
02:38:00.848 --> 02:38:02.650
we don't want to have to move, right?

3721
02:38:02.650 --> 02:38:05.170
As soon as you snap, he's probably

3722
02:38:05.170 --> 02:38:07.390
going to feel that you took the shit, right?

3723
02:38:07.390 --> 02:38:11.190
Scream fucking bloody murder and then we go--

3724
02:38:11.190 --> 02:38:12.023
LAURA: No.

3725
02:38:12.023 --> 02:38:15.890
MARISHA: Then you have to just run and then we have to run.

3726
02:38:15.890 --> 02:38:18.690
Let's try and find a rendezvous point and get the fuck out.

3727
02:38:18.690 --> 02:38:19.523
LAURA: No!
MARISHA: Yeah!

3728
02:38:19.523 --> 02:38:21.470
LAURA: That is a terrible plan.

3729
02:38:21.470 --> 02:38:22.772
MARISHA: Yeah.

3730
02:38:22.772 --> 02:38:23.770
LAURA: That's a terrible plan!

3731
02:38:23.770 --> 02:38:25.210
SAM: Ride or die.

3732
02:38:25.210 --> 02:38:26.160
MARISHA: Ride or die, man.

3733
02:38:27.085 --> 02:38:27.918
LAURA: What if Caleb just--
TRAVIS: The latter part

3734
02:38:27.918 --> 02:38:30.580
seems like a fairly obvious outcome at this point.

3735
02:38:32.015 --> 02:38:33.922
MARISHA: Well, he's got to just get the skull.

3736
02:38:33.922 --> 02:38:35.255
SAM: I'm going invisible, and I'm going to start

3737
02:38:35.255 --> 02:38:36.395
rocking around the back.
MATT: Yasha gets on a

3738
02:38:36.395 --> 02:38:38.545
knee and starts inspecting the impact.

3739
02:38:38.545 --> 02:38:43.400
Looking up while Obann is glancing and looking down.

3740
02:38:43.400 --> 02:38:44.474
What are you doing?
SAM: Invisible,

3741
02:38:44.474 --> 02:38:45.915
and I'm going to start

3742
02:38:45.915 --> 02:38:48.080
clocking around counter-clockwise.

3743
02:38:48.080 --> 02:38:49.940
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll a stealth check.

3744
02:38:49.940 --> 02:38:52.400
SAM: I'm still within your--
LAURA: I can't guide you.

3745
02:38:52.400 --> 02:38:53.540
You're too far away.

3746
02:38:53.540 --> 02:38:55.510
SAM: I'm still within your--

3747
02:38:55.510 --> 02:38:57.690
LAURA: Pass Without a Trace.
SAM: -- range but I'm going to--

3748
02:38:57.690 --> 02:38:59.170
MATT: You will be leaving it, so you do not

3749
02:38:59.170 --> 02:39:01.950
get the benefit as you continue to stealth, so just roll.

3750
02:39:01.950 --> 02:39:02.783
SAM: Natural 20.

3751
02:39:03.784 --> 02:39:05.472
LIAM: Not at all.

3752
02:39:05.472 --> 02:39:07.130
MARISHA: Goin' with it, goin' with it.

3753
02:39:07.130 --> 02:39:08.220
LIAM: Yaas, queen.

3754
02:39:08.220 --> 02:39:10.611
MARISHA: You have to seize the opportunities

3755
02:39:10.611 --> 02:39:12.990
presented to you, Tarv.

3756
02:39:12.990 --> 02:39:15.340
MATT: Behind Yasha in this direction.

3757
02:39:15.340 --> 02:39:16.360
LAURA: Travis is the one that told

3758
02:39:16.360 --> 02:39:19.160
Nott to go up there in the first place.

3759
02:39:19.160 --> 02:39:21.390
MATT: You're going behind the tree?

3760
02:39:21.390 --> 02:39:23.330
SAM: Yeah, I don't know how much movement

3761
02:39:23.330 --> 02:39:26.900
I can use on this while still being stealthy, so.

3762
02:39:26.900 --> 02:39:28.150
MATT: It's slow going.

3763
02:39:28.150 --> 02:39:29.620
It's the--

3764
02:39:29.620 --> 02:39:31.420
SAM: Sure.
MATT: Careful footing.

3765
02:39:31.420 --> 02:39:33.270
SAM: I'll still keep creeping on the bonus action.

3766
02:39:33.270 --> 02:39:34.130
MATT: Creeping up.
LIAM: Hobbit walking.

3767
02:39:34.130 --> 02:39:35.930
MATT: Yasha turns around and looks up towards Obann

3768
02:39:35.930 --> 02:39:39.738
and says, "It looks like they went this way."

3769
02:39:39.738 --> 02:39:42.588
Points in the direction where a lot of you ran to hide.

3770
02:39:42.588 --> 02:39:43.570
LIAM: Oh boy.
SAM: Oh man.

3771
02:39:43.570 --> 02:39:44.804
MARISHA: Just let it happen.

3772
02:39:44.804 --> 02:39:47.140
SAM: Just like in "Sound of Music" when Rolf

3773
02:39:47.140 --> 02:39:49.410
discovers the von Trapps.

3774
02:39:49.410 --> 02:39:51.691
Maybe it's Rolf! Maybe she's let us go.

3775
02:39:51.691 --> 02:39:53.920
MARISHA: Just let him keep doing it, let him keep doing it.

3776
02:39:53.920 --> 02:39:55.020
Hopefully she's Rolf.

3777
02:39:56.238 --> 02:39:57.320
You keep going on, you keep sticking.

3778
02:39:57.320 --> 02:39:58.990
MATT: Begins to run this direction,

3779
02:39:58.990 --> 02:40:00.420
like a jog in the direction of where

3780
02:40:00.420 --> 02:40:03.120
the Laughing Hand is essentially and heading that way.

3781
02:40:05.430 --> 02:40:07.310
You're going to try and climb the tree?

3782
02:40:07.310 --> 02:40:10.380
SAM: Not just try to climb the tree, oh wait.

3783
02:40:10.380 --> 02:40:13.550
Spider Climb's a spell. I'm going to try to climb the tree.

3784
02:40:13.550 --> 02:40:14.890
MATT: Spider Climb will break your concentration.

3785
02:40:14.890 --> 02:40:17.370
SAM: Yes, I will climb the tree stealthily.

3786
02:40:17.370 --> 02:40:21.680
MATT: Make an athletics check or acrobatics

3787
02:40:21.680 --> 02:40:23.280
with disadvantage, I'll say, because

3788
02:40:23.280 --> 02:40:27.502
you're going to do this stealthily and carefully.

3789
02:40:27.502 --> 02:40:29.860
Athletics could be a careful climb,

3790
02:40:29.860 --> 02:40:31.720
acrobatics is going to have a lot of leaping from place to

3791
02:40:31.720 --> 02:40:33.454
place and it would be really hard to stealth through that.

3792
02:40:33.454 --> 02:40:35.249
SAM: I'll do athletics.

3793
02:40:35.249 --> 02:40:36.702
Terrible.

3794
02:40:36.702 --> 02:40:38.430
Nine.

3795
02:40:38.430 --> 02:40:41.000
MATT: You get about 10 feet up on the tree.

3796
02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:42.730
MARISHA: Fuck, fuck.
MATT: And there's no handhold.

3797
02:40:42.730 --> 02:40:43.760
And you're just like--

3798
02:40:43.760 --> 02:40:44.593
MARISHA: Fuck.

3799
02:40:45.914 --> 02:40:46.747
MATT: I don't know where to go.

3800
02:40:46.747 --> 02:40:47.580
SAM: I'm 10 feet up the tree.

3801
02:40:47.580 --> 02:40:50.742
How many more feet 'til I get to Obannwan Kenobann?

3802
02:40:50.742 --> 02:40:52.100
MATT: 30 feet.

3803
02:40:52.100 --> 02:40:53.218
SAM: 30 feet?

3804
02:40:53.218 --> 02:40:54.295
MATT: Yeah.

3805
02:40:54.295 --> 02:40:55.128
Yeah.

3806
02:40:55.128 --> 02:40:56.550
SAM: That five feet makes a difference.

3807
02:40:56.550 --> 02:40:57.720
MATT: 30 feet.

3808
02:40:57.720 --> 02:41:02.060
SAM: Okay, and can I see that thing hanging off his belt?

3809
02:41:02.060 --> 02:41:03.320
MATT: From this current perspective,

3810
02:41:03.320 --> 02:41:04.780
make a perception check with disadvantage

3811
02:41:04.780 --> 02:41:06.790
because he's up in the tree, you just know he's there.

3812
02:41:06.790 --> 02:41:08.190
You don't have a good--
SAM: Terrible.

3813
02:41:08.190 --> 02:41:09.460
Two threes.

3814
02:41:09.460 --> 02:41:14.020
MATT: Yeah, you have no visual range whatsoever on,

3815
02:41:14.020 --> 02:41:15.790
all you know is he's up there

3816
02:41:15.790 --> 02:41:17.650
and you can hear his conversations with Yasha,

3817
02:41:17.650 --> 02:41:18.740
but from this perspective on the side

3818
02:41:18.740 --> 02:41:20.300
of the tree, you can't even see him.

3819
02:41:20.300 --> 02:41:21.430
MARISHA: Yeah, because you could do a little

3820
02:41:21.430 --> 02:41:24.002
Mage Hand if you just see it, right?

3821
02:41:24.002 --> 02:41:25.412
TRAVIS: ♪ Mage Hand. ♪

3822
02:41:25.412 --> 02:41:29.190
SAM: I'm going to just sit and wait for a couple seconds

3823
02:41:29.190 --> 02:41:33.881
and see if there's any other changes in the scenario.

3824
02:41:33.881 --> 02:41:38.881
MATT: Yep.

3825
02:41:39.040 --> 02:41:41.790
He, yeah, I was rolling to see when he began

3826
02:41:41.790 --> 02:41:45.220
to notice anything else and so when Yasha's moving forward

3827
02:41:45.220 --> 02:41:47.970
and with you taking your sweet time down there

3828
02:41:47.970 --> 02:41:50.370
to try and figure this out, a little too long

3829
02:41:50.370 --> 02:41:53.040
and he begins to dart (swooshing) and land

3830
02:41:53.040 --> 02:41:55.170
on the ground next to Yasha and they both continue

3831
02:41:55.170 --> 02:41:57.880
their walk forward, but you can see now there's paranoia

3832
02:41:57.880 --> 02:42:01.838
in his eyes and starting to see the tracks in the ground

3833
02:42:01.838 --> 02:42:05.340
and he's like looking around and right now

3834
02:42:05.340 --> 02:42:07.680
where Fjord and Caduceus are hiding,

3835
02:42:07.680 --> 02:42:10.702
they're like 10 feet away from you just walking by.

3836
02:42:10.702 --> 02:42:14.290
TALIESIN: If they're walking by,
I'm going to turn invisible.

3837
02:42:14.290 --> 02:42:15.123
MATT: Okay.

3838
02:42:15.123 --> 02:42:16.610
TALIESIN: The second that I even feel like they can see

3839
02:42:16.610 --> 02:42:18.490
anywhere where I am, I'm going to turn invisible.

3840
02:42:18.490 --> 02:42:21.070
MATT: Okay, so you vanish for one round.

3841
02:42:21.070 --> 02:42:22.670
TALIESIN: Yep.

3842
02:42:22.670 --> 02:42:23.503
MATT: While hiding.

3843
02:42:24.710 --> 02:42:28.230
SAM: I will slowly start to climb down that tree

3844
02:42:28.230 --> 02:42:29.850
and follow Obann.

3845
02:42:29.850 --> 02:42:31.420
MATT: Okay.

3846
02:42:31.420 --> 02:42:33.580
You are moving stealthily.
SAM: Stealthily.

3847
02:42:33.580 --> 02:42:35.780
But with Dash or whatever.

3848
02:42:35.780 --> 02:42:37.150
MATT: Okay, yeah, bonus action.

3849
02:42:37.150 --> 02:42:40.770
So you're moving normal speed.
SAM: Yeah.

3850
02:42:40.770 --> 02:42:43.490
MATT: Because you move half speed going stealthily,

3851
02:42:43.490 --> 02:42:44.920
but then the Dash, okay.

3852
02:42:44.920 --> 02:42:46.300
Well, they're also dashing because

3853
02:42:46.300 --> 02:42:47.190
they're not trying to be stealthy.

3854
02:42:47.190 --> 02:42:48.305
SAM: Sure.

3855
02:42:48.305 --> 02:42:49.138
MATT: They're trying to go for time.

3856
02:42:49.138 --> 02:42:49.971
SAM: Sure, sure.

3857
02:42:49.971 --> 02:42:51.230
MATT: So you are not keeping pace with them.

3858
02:42:51.230 --> 02:42:52.310
They're moving away from you.

3859
02:42:52.310 --> 02:42:53.347
SAM: That's fine.

3860
02:42:53.347 --> 02:42:54.300
LAURA: They are moving away from us, though?

3861
02:42:54.300 --> 02:42:56.060
MATT: They've looked around,

3862
02:42:56.060 --> 02:43:00.780
in your radius, you rolled some pretty decent stealth checks

3863
02:43:00.780 --> 02:43:02.100
so even as they're looking around,

3864
02:43:02.100 --> 02:43:05.080
they don't make out your location

3865
02:43:05.080 --> 02:43:08.270
and they move from search to now

3866
02:43:08.270 --> 02:43:11.350
try and find out whatever these creatures are

3867
02:43:11.350 --> 02:43:12.820
that they're assuming are ahead of them and they go

3868
02:43:12.820 --> 02:43:16.080
into a fast jog in the direction of the Laughing Hand.

3869
02:43:17.190 --> 02:43:18.120
TRAVIS: That's okay.
MATT: And move on.

3870
02:43:18.120 --> 02:43:19.610
TRAVIS: That's okay.
LIAM: Whoa.

3871
02:43:19.610 --> 02:43:20.443
MARISHA: Okay.

3872
02:43:21.990 --> 02:43:23.120
MATT: You.

3873
02:43:23.120 --> 02:43:25.770
TRAVIS: We know where they are,
they don't know where we are.

3874
02:43:25.770 --> 02:43:26.770
That's an advantage.

3875
02:43:28.240 --> 02:43:29.590
SAM: I'm going to

3876
02:43:29.590 --> 02:43:30.630
creepily

3877
02:43:31.690 --> 02:43:33.850
be right next to Fjord without him knowing.

3878
02:43:34.880 --> 02:43:37.213
And just be like: Hey Fjord!

3879
02:43:37.213 --> 02:43:38.529
TRAVIS: Fuck!

3880
02:43:39.570 --> 02:43:41.000
SAM: Should I keep going?

3881
02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.510
TRAVIS: No, stay with us, stay close.

3882
02:43:44.600 --> 02:43:49.010
SAM: But I can keep after them and see their movements.

3883
02:43:49.010 --> 02:43:50.850
TRAVIS: No, it's better when they split up together.

3884
02:43:50.850 --> 02:43:52.470
It's more dangerous to stay close.

3885
02:43:52.470 --> 02:43:55.830
TALIESIN: And they know, they know now, there's no surprise.

3886
02:43:57.480 --> 02:43:58.313
TRAVIS: We need to--

3887
02:43:58.313 --> 02:44:00.220
SAM: I had them, I had them.

3888
02:44:00.220 --> 02:44:01.830
MARISHA: So close.

3889
02:44:01.830 --> 02:44:05.090
TRAVIS: Being so stealthy, can we wait until they are,

3890
02:44:05.090 --> 02:44:08.840
let's call it 50 to 60 feet before we try to whisper?

3891
02:44:08.840 --> 02:44:10.130
MATT: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Okay.

3892
02:44:10.130 --> 02:44:13.910
MATT: And you do hear at the edge of visual range

3893
02:44:13.910 --> 02:44:16.600
as you're waiting, you hear Obann giving orders, like

3894
02:44:17.500 --> 02:44:20.960
"Hand, keep your nose to the air.

3895
02:44:22.760 --> 02:44:25.423
"They can't be too far, whoever they are."

3896
02:44:27.060 --> 02:44:29.160
And then they continue forward

3897
02:44:29.160 --> 02:44:31.252
in the direction of the grove.

3898
02:44:33.143 --> 02:44:34.416
LAURA: Fuck.

3899
02:44:34.416 --> 02:44:35.840
TRAVIS: That could have gone way worse.

3900
02:44:35.840 --> 02:44:38.670
SAM: But I was feet away from doing it.

3901
02:44:38.670 --> 02:44:40.060
TRAVIS: It's weird trying to talk to you

3902
02:44:40.060 --> 02:44:42.090
when I don't know where you are.

3903
02:44:42.090 --> 02:44:43.850
We should try and follow them.

3904
02:44:43.850 --> 02:44:46.470
They're moving at a quicker pace, we should match pace.

3905
02:44:47.540 --> 02:44:48.860
LAURA: And then what?

3906
02:44:48.860 --> 02:44:51.493
MARISHA: I agree, and then what?

3907
02:44:51.493 --> 02:44:54.537
The longer that we try and follow them,

3908
02:44:54.537 --> 02:44:57.658
the more likely the chances are that we're going to fucking

3909
02:44:57.658 --> 02:45:02.658
fail and they're going to notice us and I'm fine with that.

3910
02:45:02.900 --> 02:45:05.410
But I just think we should have a plan.

3911
02:45:05.410 --> 02:45:07.260
LIAM: Well, we are either starting a fight

3912
02:45:07.260 --> 02:45:09.560
with them before they reach their destination

3913
02:45:09.560 --> 02:45:11.640
or waiting for them to complete their plans,

3914
02:45:11.640 --> 02:45:15.622
which might turn them from three to four.

3915
02:45:16.830 --> 02:45:20.050
SAM: All right, we can't get there before them.

3916
02:45:20.050 --> 02:45:22.270
We can't fly there, we can't rest.

3917
02:45:22.270 --> 02:45:25.950
The only option we have is to go at pace with them

3918
02:45:25.950 --> 02:45:27.910
and when we're com--
MARISHA: And wait for a moment.

3919
02:45:27.910 --> 02:45:30.080
SAM: Not wait for a moment, create a moment.

3920
02:45:30.080 --> 02:45:33.220
We need to send two of us in front or three

3921
02:45:33.220 --> 02:45:35.310
of us in front of them and three behind

3922
02:45:35.310 --> 02:45:37.050
to make some sort of a distraction.

3923
02:45:37.050 --> 02:45:39.670
When they turn around to face the ones behind them,

3924
02:45:39.670 --> 02:45:41.150
the ones who have flanked in front

3925
02:45:41.150 --> 02:45:44.010
can go and strike or do whatever.

3926
02:45:44.010 --> 02:45:45.670
LAURA: Just run up and grab the skull.

3927
02:45:45.670 --> 02:45:48.500
TALIESIN: Assuming that he's
not going to just fly immediately.

3928
02:45:48.500 --> 02:45:50.340
TRAVIS: Remember the tree has defenses.

3929
02:45:50.340 --> 02:45:52.520
The corpse, its advice was to not go.

3930
02:45:52.520 --> 02:45:54.520
If the tree has a natural defense,

3931
02:45:54.520 --> 02:45:56.930
something that would weaken them first,

3932
02:45:56.930 --> 02:45:59.190
that could serve as a little bit of a buffer for us.

3933
02:45:59.190 --> 02:46:00.733
TALIESIN: The way that they fought us.

3934
02:46:00.733 --> 02:46:02.270
LIAM: Question for you, Jester.
LAURA: Yes?

3935
02:46:02.270 --> 02:46:06.360
LIAM: Right now, I could send Obann back to his home.

3936
02:46:06.360 --> 02:46:08.130
Are you able to do that as well right now?

3937
02:46:08.130 --> 02:46:10.550
LAURA: No, I don't have anything that powerful anymore.

3938
02:46:10.550 --> 02:46:14.580
I used up all my powerful stuff with being an owl.

3939
02:46:14.580 --> 02:46:17.055
TRAVIS: Can you send Yasha back to her home?

3940
02:46:17.055 --> 02:46:18.577
LIAM: No, Yasha is

3941
02:46:19.730 --> 02:46:21.960
of this world, but Obann is not.

3942
02:46:21.960 --> 02:46:26.960
If I am lucky, I could take Obann off of the playing field.

3943
02:46:27.022 --> 02:46:29.440
LAURA: He could resist it, but--

3944
02:46:29.440 --> 02:46:30.560
MARISHA: Yeah, what if he succeeds?

3945
02:46:30.560 --> 02:46:31.393
LIAM: Well, then--

3946
02:46:31.393 --> 02:46:33.210
MARISHA: Don't you have to be
close to him for something like that?

3947
02:46:33.210 --> 02:46:36.300
LIAM: I need to be about 50 or 60 feet away from him.

3948
02:46:36.300 --> 02:46:37.133
MARISHA: So,

3949
02:46:37.980 --> 02:46:39.910
I actually don't hate this plan, though.

3950
02:46:39.910 --> 02:46:42.170
SAM: Thank you.

3951
02:46:42.170 --> 02:46:45.790
MARISHA: Because who can make an image as well?

3952
02:46:45.790 --> 02:46:47.600
LAURA: I can Invoke Duplicity.

3953
02:46:47.600 --> 02:46:48.940
TRAVIS: I can make a Major Image.

3954
02:46:48.940 --> 02:46:50.900
SAM: I can make a Silent Image.

3955
02:46:50.900 --> 02:46:54.830
MARISHA: He knows who we are
and he's going to be looking for us.

3956
02:46:54.830 --> 02:46:58.990
If you're invisible, but if Caleb
makes an image of you being

3957
02:46:58.990 --> 02:47:03.990
there, he might not suspect that any of us are missing.

3958
02:47:04.303 --> 02:47:05.170
Unless he can see through all

3959
02:47:05.170 --> 02:47:07.470
the invisibility or the image or any of that stuff.

3960
02:47:07.470 --> 02:47:09.370
But we don't really know that.

3961
02:47:09.370 --> 02:47:10.260
SAM: Ideally,

3962
02:47:11.370 --> 02:47:13.390
when the back team makes some sort

3963
02:47:13.390 --> 02:47:16.760
of a distraction and they spin to find out what it is,

3964
02:47:16.760 --> 02:47:18.630
that's when we strike.

3965
02:47:18.630 --> 02:47:21.490
MARISHA: So what I'm saying is we line up,

3966
02:47:21.490 --> 02:47:25.510
we give them that Avengers lineup with Nott included

3967
02:47:25.510 --> 02:47:28.273
but it's an illusion Nott and invisible Nott

3968
02:47:28.273 --> 02:47:32.750
is sneaking up and while he's doing his bad guy monologue--

3969
02:47:32.750 --> 02:47:36.150
because bad guys love monologuing-- and we're like,

3970
02:47:36.150 --> 02:47:38.191
"Yo, we're going to fight you,

3971
02:47:38.191 --> 02:47:41.550
your road ends here with us."

3972
02:47:41.550 --> 02:47:44.180
You're doing that, but there's an illusion Nott the whole

3973
02:47:44.180 --> 02:47:47.152
time but the real Nott is sneaking up and stealing his shit.

3974
02:47:47.152 --> 02:47:48.660
SAM: I just realized how confusing

3975
02:47:48.660 --> 02:47:51.450
my name is in all of these conversations.

3976
02:47:51.450 --> 02:47:55.140
TRAVIS: That was a great pick, great pick for a name.

3977
02:47:55.140 --> 02:47:56.890
Okay, let's assume

3978
02:47:56.890 --> 02:48:00.820
that that terrible idea works, how do we get Nott

3979
02:48:00.820 --> 02:48:03.753
and the rest of us out of here immediately?

3980
02:48:05.060 --> 02:48:07.273
One minute for the thing that Caleb does.

3981
02:48:07.273 --> 02:48:08.660
LIAM: No, longer.

3982
02:48:08.660 --> 02:48:09.660
TRAVIS: Longer.
LIAM: 10.

3983
02:48:09.660 --> 02:48:10.890
TRAVIS: Right.

3984
02:48:10.890 --> 02:48:12.280
MATT: No, it's a minute.

3985
02:48:12.280 --> 02:48:14.790
LIAM: If I had it prepared, I don't have it prepared.

3986
02:48:14.790 --> 02:48:17.210
LAURA: I thought you had it, I thought that was the point.

3987
02:48:17.210 --> 02:48:19.250
No, we're talking about the Teleport Circle.

3988
02:48:19.250 --> 02:48:22.309
LIAM: Teleport, not the hut?

3989
02:48:22.309 --> 02:48:24.500
That's one minute then, yeah.

3990
02:48:24.500 --> 02:48:28.910
SAM: If we or I were able to swipe the skull-- skull?

3991
02:48:28.910 --> 02:48:29.743
LIAM: Yeah.

3992
02:48:29.743 --> 02:48:33.530
SAM: Then I would assume they would send
some folks after me.

3993
02:48:33.530 --> 02:48:35.450
So all I have to do is run around

3994
02:48:35.450 --> 02:48:38.300
for 59 seconds until you guys can get ready.

3995
02:48:38.300 --> 02:48:40.990
TALIESIN: Dodge three people, one of which can fly.

3996
02:48:40.990 --> 02:48:43.140
SAM: Yeah, but I'm super fast, have you seen me?

3997
02:48:43.140 --> 02:48:44.943
LAURA: Have you seen them?

3998
02:48:46.298 --> 02:48:47.923
SAM: I'm invisible sometimes, too.

3999
02:48:48.820 --> 02:48:51.330
MARISHA: But invisible Nott
would be stealing the shit, right?

4000
02:48:51.330 --> 02:48:53.020
LAURA: Oh my god, we're going to die.

4001
02:48:53.020 --> 02:48:57.490
MARISHA: And maybe illusion Nott
could be the one tricksy-ing.

4002
02:48:57.490 --> 02:48:59.582
TALIESIN: This is assuming they can't see
right through all of this.

4003
02:48:59.582 --> 02:49:02.610
LIAM: I could also make just you fly.

4004
02:49:02.610 --> 02:49:04.930
TALIESIN: Would you be able to fly faster than Obann?

4005
02:49:06.470 --> 02:49:09.350
MATT: Their movement and footfalls, by the way, are gone.

4006
02:49:09.350 --> 02:49:10.380
They moved on ahead.

4007
02:49:10.380 --> 02:49:13.447
TRAVIS: All right, we're going to keep following.

4008
02:49:13.447 --> 02:49:15.290
At about 80 feet behind.

4009
02:49:15.290 --> 02:49:16.858
TALIESIN: Maybe something's going to present itself.

4010
02:49:16.858 --> 02:49:18.716
TRAVIS: 80 to 100 feet, visible range.

4011
02:49:18.716 --> 02:49:19.830
MATT: To keep pace behind them,

4012
02:49:19.830 --> 02:49:22.340
you're going to have to be at the same jog pace they are.

4013
02:49:22.340 --> 02:49:23.870
Which means stealth checks would be disadvantage.

4014
02:49:23.870 --> 02:49:25.350
MARISHA: I'm afraid when the moment presents itself,

4015
02:49:25.350 --> 02:49:29.380
it might be an emergency and we won't have the jump on them.

4016
02:49:29.380 --> 02:49:32.790
That's all I'm presenting right now is if the moment--

4017
02:49:32.790 --> 02:49:34.370
LIAM: As we run.
MARISHA: If something happens

4018
02:49:34.370 --> 02:49:36.590
as we're trying to keep pace with them and just,

4019
02:49:36.590 --> 02:49:40.290
it's going to take one of us to snap a stick

4020
02:49:40.290 --> 02:49:42.670
and for that fucker to turn around and look at us.

4021
02:49:42.670 --> 02:49:44.290
LAURA: What if we keep pace and then how

4022
02:49:44.290 --> 02:49:46.730
far away can you make your Major Image?

4023
02:49:46.730 --> 02:49:47.790
TRAVIS: 120 feet.

4024
02:49:47.790 --> 02:49:49.640
LAURA: What if we keep pace behind them

4025
02:49:50.800 --> 02:49:55.290
and then you throw it out, we all drop stealthily,

4026
02:49:55.290 --> 02:49:57.210
you throw out the image in front of them

4027
02:49:57.210 --> 02:49:59.650
and then Nott, you run up from behind.

4028
02:49:59.650 --> 02:50:00.640
SAM: And grab it!
LAURA: Yeah.

4029
02:50:00.640 --> 02:50:03.640
SAM: And then come back.
LAURA: No flanking involved.

4030
02:50:03.640 --> 02:50:07.360
We use the Image to flank and then we just--

4031
02:50:07.360 --> 02:50:08.480
SAM: Run.

4032
02:50:08.480 --> 02:50:11.090
MARISHA: We can do that.

4033
02:50:11.090 --> 02:50:15.020
SAM: And you need a minute in one stationary place.

4034
02:50:15.020 --> 02:50:16.550
No, you need 10 seconds?

4035
02:50:16.550 --> 02:50:17.588
LIAM: A minute.

4036
02:50:17.588 --> 02:50:19.630
SAM: In a stationary place.
TRAVIS: In theory,

4037
02:50:19.630 --> 02:50:20.720
if we're stationary, we should

4038
02:50:20.720 --> 02:50:21.930
get to the outside of this tree,

4039
02:50:21.930 --> 02:50:22.940
I would assume they're going to get

4040
02:50:22.940 --> 02:50:25.170
to the outside of it and assess it, right?

4041
02:50:25.170 --> 02:50:27.280
MARISHA: We're not going to beat them to that.

4042
02:50:27.280 --> 02:50:28.970
TRAVIS: No, I know.
LAURA: But you can make the Image

4043
02:50:28.970 --> 02:50:30.150
come out of the tree or something.

4044
02:50:30.150 --> 02:50:31.220
TRAVIS: That's what I mean, if they get to the tree

4045
02:50:31.220 --> 02:50:33.450
and they stop and assess it, he takes a minute to prepare,

4046
02:50:33.450 --> 02:50:36.650
we wait, we conjure, we fucking go for it.

4047
02:50:36.650 --> 02:50:39.220
MARISHA: But what I'm saying is we could still be hours

4048
02:50:39.220 --> 02:50:41.830
from the tree and the longer that we pace them,

4049
02:50:41.830 --> 02:50:44.280
the longer that we're tracking them,

4050
02:50:44.280 --> 02:50:46.720
the more opportunities with each footfall--

4051
02:50:46.720 --> 02:50:48.690
TRAVIS: At 100 feet.
MARISHA: We have to alerting them.

4052
02:50:48.690 --> 02:50:50.680
MATT: Distance-wise because you have
gotten close enough to see,

4053
02:50:50.680 --> 02:50:52.900
you're probably about an hour

4054
02:50:52.900 --> 02:50:54.910
travel from the edge of the grove.

4055
02:50:54.910 --> 02:50:57.090
MARISHA: Do we think we can stalk behind them

4056
02:50:57.090 --> 02:50:59.210
for an hour without making our presence known?

4057
02:50:59.210 --> 02:51:00.600
SAM: Yes.
TRAVIS: At 100 feet?

4058
02:51:00.600 --> 02:51:04.230
SAM: I think that five of us can be 300 feet behind

4059
02:51:04.230 --> 02:51:07.620
and only one of us needs to be within 100 feet

4060
02:51:07.620 --> 02:51:08.970
making sure that they're--

4061
02:51:10.320 --> 02:51:12.250
TRAVIS: How long does Pass Without-- it's 10 minutes, right?

4062
02:51:12.250 --> 02:51:13.083
LAURA: 10 minutes.

4063
02:51:14.020 --> 02:51:16.020
And I can't keep doing it.
TRAVIS: No, I know, I know.

4064
02:51:16.020 --> 02:51:17.140
Because we fucking came out here.

4065
02:51:17.140 --> 02:51:19.936
TALIESIN: We're almost empty and will have no spells.

4066
02:51:19.936 --> 02:51:22.766
TRAVIS: (high-pitched, nervous, closed-mouth scream)

4067
02:51:22.766 --> 02:51:24.220
MARISHA: I think we have element

4068
02:51:24.220 --> 02:51:26.010
of surprise sooner rather than later.

4069
02:51:26.010 --> 02:51:27.560
But that's just me.

4070
02:51:27.560 --> 02:51:28.889
TRAVIS: Do you want to do it now?
MARISHA: I think we do it sooner.

4071
02:51:28.889 --> 02:51:29.722
I don't know.

4072
02:51:29.722 --> 02:51:31.760
LIAM: Take them before they get there.

4073
02:51:31.760 --> 02:51:33.177
SAM: Let's do it.

4074
02:51:34.873 --> 02:51:36.150
Ride or die.

4075
02:51:36.150 --> 02:51:39.850
LAURA: The minute you throw out Major Image,

4076
02:51:39.850 --> 02:51:42.780
Caleb starts casting, you prep it--

4077
02:51:42.780 --> 02:51:43.840
MARISHA: We try and distract them--
LAURA: Nott goes in.

4078
02:51:43.840 --> 02:51:46.331
MARISHA: For as long as we can, Nott goes in.

4079
02:51:46.331 --> 02:51:47.170
TALIESIN: 10 rounds is a long time to distract.

4080
02:51:47.170 --> 02:51:48.740
MARISHA: 10 rounds is an insanely long time

4081
02:51:48.740 --> 02:51:50.510
but hopefully the Major Image can do

4082
02:51:50.510 --> 02:51:51.920
most of the heavy lifting, right?

4083
02:51:51.920 --> 02:51:52.970
TALIESIN: Assuming they don't just,

4084
02:51:52.970 --> 02:51:54.450
instead of talking, immediately charge.

4085
02:51:54.450 --> 02:51:55.570
MARISHA: Turn around.

4086
02:51:55.570 --> 02:51:56.580
TALIESIN: Turn around and charge.
MARISHA: And look at us.

4087
02:51:56.580 --> 02:51:57.413
TALIESIN: And murder us.

4088
02:51:58.980 --> 02:52:01.000
SAM: Is there any other way

4089
02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:02.950
that we can get away from them quickly?

4090
02:52:04.290 --> 02:52:05.700
TALIESIN: They're faster than us.

4091
02:52:05.700 --> 02:52:07.100
MARISHA: I miss being the druid.

4092
02:52:08.130 --> 02:52:10.306
SAM: What are you talking about?

4093
02:52:10.306 --> 02:52:12.228
(laughter)

4094
02:52:12.228 --> 02:52:14.000
LIAM: Are you about to turn into
an owl again or that's done?

4095
02:52:14.000 --> 02:52:17.670
LAURA: I'm done, I literally have jack a-shit.

4096
02:52:17.670 --> 02:52:22.060
I have the ability to revive you guys if you die.

4097
02:52:22.060 --> 02:52:22.893
TALIESIN: If one of you.

4098
02:52:23.740 --> 02:52:24.820
LAURA: One person.

4099
02:52:24.820 --> 02:52:26.293
MARISHA: I can run real fast.

4100
02:52:28.910 --> 02:52:30.260
That's all I got.

4101
02:52:30.260 --> 02:52:33.170
TALIESIN: That's assuming that the
laughter doesn't take you.

4102
02:52:33.170 --> 02:52:36.461
LAURA: Plus, I could potentially try to,
you know,

4103
02:52:36.461 --> 02:52:41.194
Command them to halt.
LIAM: We could improvise, yeah.

4104
02:52:41.194 --> 02:52:43.670
MATT: You've been moving to try and keep pace

4105
02:52:43.670 --> 02:52:45.840
with them while you've been having this conversation, right?

4106
02:52:45.840 --> 02:52:47.450
SAM: Yeah, so we probably should roll for stealth.

4107
02:52:47.450 --> 02:52:49.220
LIAM: So we should roll at disadvantage for stealth?

4108
02:52:49.220 --> 02:52:51.930
MATT: You're not keeping pace if you're moving stealthily.

4109
02:52:51.930 --> 02:52:52.879
LAURA: Right.

4110
02:52:52.879 --> 02:52:54.470
MATT: Either you move stealthily and the gap continues

4111
02:52:54.470 --> 02:52:55.800
because they're not moving stealthily or you

4112
02:52:55.800 --> 02:52:58.435
keep pace and then roll stealth at disadvantage.

4113
02:52:58.435 --> 02:52:59.268
SAM: We're keeping pace.

4114
02:52:59.268 --> 02:53:01.130
TALIESIN: We're keeping pace, but far enough back that

4115
02:53:01.130 --> 02:53:03.370
we would have to be real dumb for them to hear us.

4116
02:53:03.370 --> 02:53:04.220
MATT: Where are you keeping pace, then?

4117
02:53:04.220 --> 02:53:06.340
What is the distance you want to keep?

4118
02:53:06.340 --> 02:53:08.020
TALIESIN: Like 300 feet.
LAURA: 100.

4119
02:53:08.020 --> 02:53:08.853
TRAVIS: 80. What, 300 feet?

4120
02:53:08.853 --> 02:53:10.920
LIAM: 200 feet back.
LAURA: I think 100.

4121
02:53:10.920 --> 02:53:13.310
TALIESIN: 100 feet's still within spellcasting.

4122
02:53:13.310 --> 02:53:14.143
LAURA: This is true.

4123
02:53:14.143 --> 02:53:15.840
MARISHA: 100 feet is still within earshot.

4124
02:53:15.840 --> 02:53:17.395
LAURA: Is it?

4125
02:53:17.395 --> 02:53:18.661
200 feet.

4126
02:53:18.661 --> 02:53:20.790
MARISHA: This studio is 100 feet. I can hear from

4127
02:53:20.790 --> 02:53:23.050
the other side of the studio if someone does something.

4128
02:53:23.050 --> 02:53:25.260
TRAVIS: All right, 300 feet.
MATT: 300 feet, all right.

4129
02:53:25.260 --> 02:53:29.160
You guys jog up to try and keep what you assume

4130
02:53:29.160 --> 02:53:30.750
is about a 300-foot distance from them without

4131
02:53:30.750 --> 02:53:33.758
visual range on them, just pushing in that direction.

4132
02:53:34.780 --> 02:53:37.410
Everyone make stealth checks with disadvantage, please.

4133
02:53:42.590 --> 02:53:47.523
MARISHA: Disadvantage. That's cocked, right?
TRAVIS: 17.

4134
02:53:47.523 --> 02:53:48.923
TRAVIS: That is cocked.

4135
02:53:50.140 --> 02:53:51.317
MARISHA: RIP almost 20.

4136
02:53:51.317 --> 02:53:53.232
TALIESIN: We don't have Pass Without a Trace.

4137
02:53:53.232 --> 02:53:54.293
LAURA: Nope.

4138
02:53:54.293 --> 02:53:55.736
MARISHA: It's not cocked, right?
TRAVIS: No.

4139
02:53:55.736 --> 02:53:57.136
SAM: It's disadvantage, right?

4140
02:53:57.136 --> 02:53:58.977
LAURA: You rolled a one?
LIAM: I rolled a one with disadvantage.

4141
02:53:58.977 --> 02:54:00.050
MATT: But just a straight roll for you because you

4142
02:54:00.050 --> 02:54:01.257
have an advantage on your stealth checks.

4143
02:54:01.257 --> 02:54:02.904
MARISHA: Do we still have Pass Without a Trace?

4144
02:54:02.904 --> 02:54:06.492
LAURA: Only for 10 minutes. It's going to be gone, probably.

4145
02:54:06.492 --> 02:54:07.403
MARISHA: 20.

4146
02:54:07.403 --> 02:54:08.530
MATT: Okay.

4147
02:54:08.530 --> 02:54:09.648
SAM: Natural 20.

4148
02:54:09.648 --> 02:54:11.056
LAURA: Well that's good, that balances Caleb.

4149
02:54:11.056 --> 02:54:12.739
LIAM: Cancel each other out.
SAM: Maybe.

4150
02:54:12.739 --> 02:54:13.850
I don't know about that.

4151
02:54:13.850 --> 02:54:15.408
TALIESIN: 15.

4152
02:54:15.408 --> 02:54:17.190
MARISHA: Oh, you don't get disadvantage, right.

4153
02:54:17.190 --> 02:54:19.890
MATT: You guys push on

4154
02:54:19.890 --> 02:54:23.281
for about 15 or 20 minutes or so

4155
02:54:23.281 --> 02:54:26.020
to where you just catch up within probably about

4156
02:54:26.020 --> 02:54:29.290
200 feet of them to where you can begin to hear

4157
02:54:29.290 --> 02:54:33.420
their movement and their shifting and their jogging,

4158
02:54:33.420 --> 02:54:35.630
snapping of twigs and moving over of brush

4159
02:54:35.630 --> 02:54:38.710
and the slashing of bits of heavy foliage that

4160
02:54:38.710 --> 02:54:42.940
get in the way and at that point you hear all

4161
02:54:42.940 --> 02:54:46.283
the footfalls stop for a second and you guys stop

4162
02:54:47.540 --> 02:54:48.850
and you can just barely make out through

4163
02:54:48.850 --> 02:54:51.720
the little bit of moonlight that's coming through the trees

4164
02:54:51.720 --> 02:54:53.670
Obann, hand up like this, goes,

4165
02:54:55.870 --> 02:54:57.415
"I heard something."

4166
02:54:57.415 --> 02:54:58.530
TRAVIS: Now?

4167
02:54:58.530 --> 02:54:59.730
LAURA: (whispering) Do it!
MATT: "Hand, hunt them.

4168
02:54:59.730 --> 02:55:00.640
"We're going."

4169
02:55:00.640 --> 02:55:02.260
And him and Yasha continue to move on

4170
02:55:02.260 --> 02:55:04.160
in the direction while the Hand turns around.

4171
02:55:04.160 --> 02:55:04.993
MARISHA: Fucking forgot about the Hand!

4172
02:55:04.993 --> 02:55:06.493
We don't want to fuck with the Hand.

4173
02:55:06.493 --> 02:55:08.080
MATT: And now turns around and

4174
02:55:08.080 --> 02:55:10.940
glances around loosely in the direction you guys are.

4175
02:55:10.940 --> 02:55:12.510
SAM: Fuck, we got to get past the Hand now.

4176
02:55:12.510 --> 02:55:14.910
MARISHA: Now we got to get past the Hand.

4177
02:55:14.910 --> 02:55:16.769
MATT: And he's moving.

4178
02:55:16.769 --> 02:55:18.362
SAM: Fluffernutter!

4179
02:55:18.362 --> 02:55:20.040
MATT: Zig zag through the brush.

4180
02:55:20.040 --> 02:55:21.482
TRAVIS: I could give him a demon to play with.

4181
02:55:21.482 --> 02:55:23.410
LIAM: He's separated, though.
SAM: You could.

4182
02:55:23.410 --> 02:55:24.730
MARISHA: And then we keep going?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4183
02:55:24.730 --> 02:55:26.780
MARISHA: Yeah, do it.

4184
02:55:26.780 --> 02:55:28.430
MATT: You see the tree now nearby,

4185
02:55:28.430 --> 02:55:31.060
it takes the blade and like--

4186
02:55:31.060 --> 02:55:33.380
TRAVIS: I'll reach my hand out and I'll summon

4187
02:55:33.380 --> 02:55:35.790
the Star Razor sword and I'll reach up

4188
02:55:35.790 --> 02:55:38.240
and point and my eyes roll back and I'll say:

4189
02:55:39.447 --> 02:55:43.260
Barlgura! And I'll Summon a Greater Demon.

4190
02:55:43.260 --> 02:55:44.780
MATT: Okay.

4191
02:55:44.780 --> 02:55:48.590
As your eyes roll back and the energy flows into your eyes--

4192
02:55:50.065 --> 02:55:51.390
First off,

4193
02:55:53.190 --> 02:55:54.380
just a reminder, you need to look

4194
02:55:54.380 --> 02:55:56.390
at the components of the spell.

4195
02:55:57.690 --> 02:55:59.390
SAM: Ooh boy, what does that mean?

4196
02:56:01.280 --> 02:56:02.999
LIAM: What a great way to introduce this.

4197
02:56:02.999 --> 02:56:05.320
TRAVIS: Visual, yes.

4198
02:56:05.320 --> 02:56:07.680
MATT: Previously, so we're looking it up afterward.

4199
02:56:07.680 --> 02:56:10.030
One of the challenges of summoning demons,

4200
02:56:11.180 --> 02:56:13.680
you have to look at the components of the spell.

4201
02:56:13.680 --> 02:56:14.580
MARISHA: Under spellcasting.

4202
02:56:15.940 --> 02:56:17.930
TRAVIS: Have I ever had to look at the
components of the spell?

4203
02:56:17.930 --> 02:56:18.880
SAM: You're starting now.

4204
02:56:18.880 --> 02:56:20.550
LIAM: You were supposed to, you just didn't, so now--

4205
02:56:20.550 --> 02:56:22.400
TALIESIN: Now you got to.
LIAM: Now, you're on the clock.

4206
02:56:22.400 --> 02:56:24.159
MATT: Summon Greater Demon requires, yep,

4207
02:56:24.159 --> 02:56:25.987
requires a vial of blood

4208
02:56:25.987 --> 02:56:28.250
from a humanoid killed within the past 24 hours.

4209
02:56:28.250 --> 02:56:30.370
MARISHA: Can you take my blood right now?

4210
02:56:30.370 --> 02:56:31.612
LAURA: If you were killed.

4211
02:56:31.612 --> 02:56:35.560
SAM: We were just by some dead humanoids.

4212
02:56:35.560 --> 02:56:36.800
LAURA: If he knew that he needed it,

4213
02:56:36.800 --> 02:56:39.740
you could have gotten blood from a dead humanoid.

4214
02:56:39.740 --> 02:56:40.820
MARISHA: We did have one.

4215
02:56:40.820 --> 02:56:43.630
MATT: You did come across a freshly killed humanoid.

4216
02:56:43.630 --> 02:56:45.220
Roll an intelligence check for me, Fjord.

4217
02:56:45.220 --> 02:56:46.660
SAM: See if you would've remembered.

4218
02:56:46.660 --> 02:56:49.060
MATT: I'm saying just from that standpoint,

4219
02:56:49.060 --> 02:56:51.480
to have thought about that in advance.

4220
02:56:51.480 --> 02:56:54.030
LAURA: If Travis would have known that--

4221
02:56:54.030 --> 02:56:54.863
TRAVIS: 22.

4222
02:56:54.863 --> 02:56:56.960
MATT: 22? Yes, I will allow it.

4223
02:56:56.960 --> 02:56:57.890
I will say

4224
02:56:57.890 --> 02:57:00.010
in the time that you'd come across these bodies,

4225
02:57:00.010 --> 02:57:01.450
knowing the danger that you were facing

4226
02:57:01.450 --> 02:57:04.090
and the components required for the spell, just

4227
02:57:05.180 --> 02:57:08.020
as an optional precaution,

4228
02:57:08.020 --> 02:57:09.820
you took a vial of semi-coagulated blood

4229
02:57:09.820 --> 02:57:12.168
from the corpses that were left behind.

4230
02:57:12.168 --> 02:57:13.260
MARISHA: That's good.

4231
02:57:13.260 --> 02:57:16.310
MATT: Stealthily without the rest of your party knowing.

4232
02:57:16.310 --> 02:57:18.680
TRAVIS: I can look through all the rest

4233
02:57:18.680 --> 02:57:22.280
of my spells and figure out what components they need?

4234
02:57:22.280 --> 02:57:24.560
MATT: Yeah.
TRAVIS: In the middle of this?!

4235
02:57:24.560 --> 02:57:27.420
MATT: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Cool.

4236
02:57:27.420 --> 02:57:28.690
MARISHA: I can help you.

4237
02:57:28.690 --> 02:57:31.190
TRAVIS: The sword was never an arcane focus or whatever?

4238
02:57:32.290 --> 02:57:33.570
MATT: Physical components--

4239
02:57:34.521 --> 02:57:35.740
LIAM: The ones that you can't get around.

4240
02:57:35.740 --> 02:57:37.740
MATT: Yeah, the ones that--

4241
02:57:37.740 --> 02:57:39.800
MARISHA: You can use a focus for some

4242
02:57:39.800 --> 02:57:41.700
but if it's a big spell,

4243
02:57:41.700 --> 02:57:44.650
then you have to have a thing.

4244
02:57:44.650 --> 02:57:46.980
LAURA: I use the Traveler's symbol
for a focus on some of my--

4245
02:57:46.980 --> 02:57:49.520
TRAVIS: All of these things have fucking components.

4246
02:57:49.520 --> 02:57:51.450
TALIESIN: Components only if they're worth something.

4247
02:57:51.450 --> 02:57:54.920
MATT: No, this isn't worth something, actually this is a--

4248
02:57:54.920 --> 02:57:56.840
MARISHA: Because like you can have a component bag.

4249
02:57:56.840 --> 02:57:57.860
TALIESIN: Or something that wouldn't last.

4250
02:57:57.860 --> 02:57:59.260
MARISHA: Like you have a component bag.

4251
02:57:59.260 --> 02:58:00.540
TRAVIS: I do, too.

4252
02:58:00.540 --> 02:58:01.840
LIAM: Sure.

4253
02:58:01.840 --> 02:58:04.610
MARISHA: But then it's like special items.

4254
02:58:04.610 --> 02:58:05.490
TALIESIN: We're so fucked.

4255
02:58:05.490 --> 02:58:06.640
SAM: Next time we're in a town,

4256
02:58:06.640 --> 02:58:09.010
we're just going to stock up on the weirdest shit.

4257
02:58:09.983 --> 02:58:11.210
I need spider legs.
LIAM: Excuse me,

4258
02:58:11.210 --> 02:58:12.830
I've made a point of getting weird shit

4259
02:58:12.830 --> 02:58:14.680
since the beginning of this campaign.

4260
02:58:15.842 --> 02:58:20.020
TRAVIS: An undead eyeball encased in a gem worth 150 gold?

4261
02:58:20.020 --> 02:58:22.510
MATT: If it says that something--

4262
02:58:23.840 --> 02:58:25.510
LIAM: Hey, if it's got a coin value,

4263
02:58:25.510 --> 02:58:26.920
for certain you have to have that shit.

4264
02:58:26.920 --> 02:58:29.250
TRAVIS: An undead eyeball encased in a gem?

4265
02:58:29.250 --> 02:58:30.520
Worth 150?

4266
02:58:30.520 --> 02:58:31.920
LAURA: I mean, where would you find that?

4267
02:58:31.920 --> 02:58:33.710
MATT: Hold on.
TALIESIN: An undead eyeball store.

4268
02:58:33.710 --> 02:58:34.810
LAURA: Hold on, he's saying hold on.

4269
02:58:34.810 --> 02:58:37.890
MARISHA: We did a Handbooker Helper episode on this.

4270
02:58:37.890 --> 02:58:41.750
One was about, you can have a focus for some things.

4271
02:58:41.750 --> 02:58:42.950
LIAM: If it doesn't have a cost.

4272
02:58:42.950 --> 02:58:45.079
MARISHA: But then it depends on the other, yeah.

4273
02:58:45.079 --> 02:58:47.821
SAM: ♪ Don't know how to play ♪

4274
02:58:47.821 --> 02:58:49.440
LAURA: ♪ We'll blow you away ♪

4275
02:58:49.440 --> 02:58:50.443
MATT: Okay.

4276
02:58:50.443 --> 02:58:52.180
LIAM: ♪ Eyeball, eyeball, eyeball ♪

4277
02:58:52.180 --> 02:58:54.460
MATT: Jeremy Crawford tweeted as a response,

4278
02:58:54.460 --> 02:58:56.150
"To create the circle in the Summon

4279
02:58:56.150 --> 02:58:57.240
"Lesser or Greater Demon spell,

4280
02:58:57.240 --> 02:58:59.310
"you need the blood mentioned in the spell's description.

4281
02:58:59.310 --> 02:59:01.490
"A focus cannot substitute the material, the blood."

4282
02:59:01.490 --> 02:59:03.900
MARISHA: Wait, did Jeremy Crawford just tweet that?

4283
02:59:03.900 --> 02:59:05.878
MATT: No, this was

4284
02:59:05.878 --> 02:59:08.070
November 27th, 2017, I searched it.

4285
02:59:08.070 --> 02:59:10.003
LAURA: Wow.

4286
02:59:10.003 --> 02:59:12.680
MATT: It does require the material component cost for that.

4287
02:59:12.680 --> 02:59:14.180
But you have it because you rolled high enough

4288
02:59:14.180 --> 02:59:16.300
intelligence and I'm saying that you had the precaution,

4289
02:59:16.300 --> 02:59:19.042
you took the measure to do so in advance.

4290
02:59:19.042 --> 02:59:20.044
LIAM: D&amp;D, live and learn.

4291
02:59:20.044 --> 02:59:21.830
MARISHA: We're going to break that down after this show

4292
02:59:21.830 --> 02:59:24.970
because I'm confused and curious but we'll--

4293
02:59:24.970 --> 02:59:26.460
After the show.

4294
02:59:26.460 --> 02:59:27.440
MATT: Sure.

4295
02:59:27.440 --> 02:59:28.730
It does state in the spell's description that it

4296
02:59:28.730 --> 02:59:31.840
consumes the blood, but anyway,
we'll go with that afterward.

4297
02:59:31.840 --> 02:59:34.460
It's fine, you were able to use the spell in this instance.

4298
02:59:34.460 --> 02:59:36.430
As you close your eyes, concentrating

4299
02:59:36.430 --> 02:59:38.330
on the vengeance that you had

4300
02:59:38.330 --> 02:59:41.766
subtly promised to these two that you found dead

4301
02:59:41.766 --> 02:59:43.830
and slaughtered in the center of the Lotusden,

4302
02:59:43.830 --> 02:59:46.453
you expend the vial of blood that you took

4303
02:59:46.453 --> 02:59:49.030
from the corpses and in doing so (bubbling),

4304
02:59:49.030 --> 02:59:52.000
this darkened circle appears.

4305
02:59:52.000 --> 02:59:55.030
Whereas previously red energy

4306
02:59:55.030 --> 02:59:58.390
summoned this demon forward, this has a dull,

4307
02:59:58.390 --> 03:00:01.620
vibrant green, verdant color to it

4308
03:00:01.620 --> 03:00:03.500
and as the circle swirls, as opposed to these

4309
03:00:03.500 --> 03:00:08.350
jagged arcane runes, they're curved elvish

4310
03:00:08.350 --> 03:00:12.380
and as the barlgura emerges, its skin is actually

4311
03:00:12.380 --> 03:00:16.040
green and black and where you saw once

4312
03:00:16.040 --> 03:00:19.850
these jagged elements here, it seems to have

4313
03:00:19.850 --> 03:00:23.500
a fey quality to its appearance.

4314
03:00:23.500 --> 03:00:25.122
It is not the demon that you had

4315
03:00:25.122 --> 03:00:28.800
seen previously summoned by Fjord.

4316
03:00:28.800 --> 03:00:31.680
As it lands, (thudding) you see the Laughing Hand

4317
03:00:31.680 --> 03:00:35.568
glance over in the direction of Fjord originally.

4318
03:00:35.568 --> 03:00:37.520
The big toothy grin curving across its face

4319
03:00:37.520 --> 03:00:40.528
as it begins to lumber towards you

4320
03:00:40.528 --> 03:00:41.830
to close the distance.

4321
03:00:41.830 --> 03:00:44.568
The barlgura appears to its side.

4322
03:00:44.568 --> 03:00:46.537
And it turns towards it.

4323
03:00:46.537 --> 03:00:47.370
(growling)

4324
03:00:47.370 --> 03:00:48.950
LIAM: Round two.

4325
03:00:48.950 --> 03:00:50.158
MARISHA: Fight.

4326
03:00:53.710 --> 03:00:54.910
MATT: It's going to turn on the barlgura.

4327
03:00:54.910 --> 03:00:56.130
TRAVIS: Ooh.
LAURA: Yeah.

4328
03:00:56.130 --> 03:00:57.680
MATT: And it turns at it and immediately

4329
03:00:57.680 --> 03:00:59.820
just goes in and starts hacking away.

4330
03:00:59.820 --> 03:01:01.800
Let's go ahead and see how this combat plays out.

4331
03:01:01.800 --> 03:01:02.700
What are you guys doing?

4332
03:01:02.700 --> 03:01:04.060
LAURA: Moving forward.
SAM: Sneaking around.

4333
03:01:04.060 --> 03:01:05.600
Sneaking around, sneaking around.

4334
03:01:05.600 --> 03:01:08.140
MATT: All right, so you're going stealthily?

4335
03:01:08.140 --> 03:01:08.973
TALIESIN: Yes.

4336
03:01:08.973 --> 03:01:10.820
MATT: That means you'll move with a dash,

4337
03:01:10.820 --> 03:01:13.490
60 feet in a turn for the base of you.

4338
03:01:13.490 --> 03:01:15.080
So it'll take you about four or five rounds

4339
03:01:15.080 --> 03:01:16.940
before you can even really catch up to where it is

4340
03:01:16.940 --> 03:01:19.330
since you're about 200 to 300 feet back.

4341
03:01:19.330 --> 03:01:20.680
Just a heads up.

4342
03:01:20.680 --> 03:01:22.270
So the Laughing Hand is now

4343
03:01:22.270 --> 03:01:24.046
going toe to toe with the barlgura.

4344
03:01:24.046 --> 03:01:26.546
TRAVIS: Should we run wide, should we run wide and fast?

4345
03:01:27.740 --> 03:01:29.970
I mean, it's the Laughing Hand fighting a barlgura

4346
03:01:29.970 --> 03:01:32.230
and we're going to be running away from where the melee is

4347
03:01:32.230 --> 03:01:34.790
and swinging wide to try and catch up and run parallel.

4348
03:01:34.790 --> 03:01:36.270
MATT: Roll initiative for the barlgura.

4349
03:01:38.044 --> 03:01:39.021
LAURA: Okay.

4350
03:01:42.500 --> 03:01:43.770
TRAVIS: 15.
MATT: 15, okay.

4351
03:01:43.770 --> 03:01:45.670
Barlgura goes first.
TRAVIS: Hey.

4352
03:01:45.670 --> 03:01:46.830
SAM: Let's just run.

4353
03:01:46.830 --> 03:01:48.085
LAURA: Let's just run.

4354
03:01:48.085 --> 03:01:49.110
TALIESIN: Run wide.

4355
03:01:49.110 --> 03:01:50.500
MATT: Running wide?
LIAM: Running wide?

4356
03:01:50.500 --> 03:01:52.390
LAURA: We're trying to step lightly as we're running.

4357
03:01:52.390 --> 03:01:53.350
LIAM: No, we're running wide.

4358
03:01:53.350 --> 03:01:55.050
It's one or the other, it's binary.

4359
03:01:55.050 --> 03:01:57.000
MATT: Okay, so you guys are going into a run now.

4360
03:01:57.000 --> 03:01:58.242
LIAM: Yep.

4361
03:01:58.242 --> 03:01:59.858
MATT: Continuing off to the side at an angle

4362
03:01:59.858 --> 03:02:02.330
to not immediately follow in the path of Obann and Yasha.

4363
03:02:02.330 --> 03:02:04.992
All right, so that can be--

4364
03:02:04.992 --> 03:02:06.760
dashing through this area,

4365
03:02:06.760 --> 03:02:09.840
it's not the best terrain at a strong speed.

4366
03:02:09.840 --> 03:02:12.320
So we'll say because it is heavily forested,

4367
03:02:12.320 --> 03:02:13.200
it is difficult terrain,

4368
03:02:13.200 --> 03:02:16.395
so you're at a half speed for a lot of this.

4369
03:02:17.323 --> 03:02:18.481
So that balances out.

4370
03:02:18.481 --> 03:02:20.060
It'll take you about three rounds to get past him.

4371
03:02:20.060 --> 03:02:22.150
Nevertheless, barlgura goes first while you guys are running.

4372
03:02:22.150 --> 03:02:23.730
TRAVIS: The barlgura can innately cast

4373
03:02:23.730 --> 03:02:26.370
the following spells requiring no material components.

4374
03:02:26.370 --> 03:02:29.490
He will cast Invisibility on himself.

4375
03:02:29.490 --> 03:02:30.323
MATT: Okay.

4376
03:02:31.930 --> 03:02:33.715
That's his action.
TRAVIS: That's his action.

4377
03:02:33.715 --> 03:02:35.152
MATT: Is he going to try and move away?

4378
03:02:35.152 --> 03:02:38.942
TRAVIS: He will loudly run in the opposite

4379
03:02:38.942 --> 03:02:42.220
direction of where he sees the group running.

4380
03:02:42.220 --> 03:02:43.557
MATT: You got it.

4381
03:02:43.557 --> 03:02:44.960
In his first couple footfalls,

4382
03:02:44.960 --> 03:02:46.820
he goes in and takes a swing in the direction as he sees it

4383
03:02:46.820 --> 03:02:50.110
vanish as it heads that direction and (growl-laugh)

4384
03:02:50.110 --> 03:02:53.400
swing with its large, wide blade arm

4385
03:02:53.400 --> 03:02:56.099
with disadvantage, because it is invisible.

4386
03:02:57.257 --> 03:02:58.968
18.

4387
03:02:58.968 --> 03:03:00.530
TRAVIS: (scatting)

4388
03:03:00.530 --> 03:03:01.687
Hits.
MATT: Okay.

4389
03:03:01.687 --> 03:03:02.520
SAM: Shit.

4390
03:03:02.520 --> 03:03:03.795
MATT: That is...

4391
03:03:05.080 --> 03:03:06.980
21 points of slashing damage.

4392
03:03:06.980 --> 03:03:07.930
TRAVIS: Okay.

4393
03:03:07.930 --> 03:03:09.758
MATT: And the barlgura needs to make a concentration check.

4394
03:03:09.758 --> 03:03:11.016
SAM: A-damn.

4395
03:03:13.010 --> 03:03:14.550
MATT: So roll a constitution saving throw.

4396
03:03:14.550 --> 03:03:15.900
TRAVIS: Constitution saving throw.

4397
03:03:15.900 --> 03:03:20.703
SAM: This is our big first fight
in four episodes and none of us are in it.

4398
03:03:20.703 --> 03:03:22.285
TRAVIS: 18.

4399
03:03:22.285 --> 03:03:24.580
MATT: 18? Yeah, it maintains concentration.

4400
03:03:24.580 --> 03:03:25.413
TRAVIS: Okay.
MATT: Okay.

4401
03:03:25.413 --> 03:03:28.110
It lumbers off, it's now the Laughing Hand's turn.

4402
03:03:28.110 --> 03:03:30.520
What's the movement speed on the barlgura?

4403
03:03:30.520 --> 03:03:31.750
TRAVIS: 40 feet.

4404
03:03:31.750 --> 03:03:32.950
MATT: That's the speed of the Laughing Hand.

4405
03:03:32.950 --> 03:03:35.280
He catches up to where he thinks it may be and is going to

4406
03:03:35.280 --> 03:03:38.750
swing wide in the general vicinity of where it is.

4407
03:03:38.750 --> 03:03:40.316
It's going to make...

4408
03:03:41.220 --> 03:03:43.810
two melee attacks

4409
03:03:43.810 --> 03:03:45.948
with the blade arm.

4410
03:03:48.060 --> 03:03:51.990
With disadvantage, that is going to be a 14 to hit.

4411
03:03:51.990 --> 03:03:53.470
TRAVIS: Misses.
MATT: Misses.

4412
03:03:53.470 --> 03:03:55.029
Goes wide.

4413
03:03:55.029 --> 03:03:57.841
Now he's going to attempt to do a slam attack on it.

4414
03:03:57.841 --> 03:03:59.470
With disadvantage.

4415
03:03:59.470 --> 03:04:01.470
That is going to be a 20 to hit.

4416
03:04:01.470 --> 03:04:02.880
TRAVIS: That does hit.
MATT: Okay.

4417
03:04:02.880 --> 03:04:04.680
So the barlgura now takes...

4418
03:04:05.700 --> 03:04:07.580
14 points of bludgeoning damage.

4419
03:04:09.100 --> 03:04:12.568
And needs to make another constitution saving throw.

4420
03:04:15.040 --> 03:04:16.260
TRAVIS: That is a 17.

4421
03:04:17.230 --> 03:04:18.310
MATT: 17.

4422
03:04:18.310 --> 03:04:20.520
Okay, so it maintains concentration, it's still invisible.

4423
03:04:20.520 --> 03:04:24.090
You guys move wide another full range of movement.

4424
03:04:24.090 --> 03:04:25.290
Beau and...

4425
03:04:26.860 --> 03:04:28.450
Nott are ahead of the group

4426
03:04:28.450 --> 03:04:29.760
because of your speed that you're traveling

4427
03:04:29.760 --> 03:04:32.190
unless you want to stay in pace with the rest of them.

4428
03:04:32.190 --> 03:04:33.508
SAM: Nope.
MATT: Okay.

4429
03:04:33.508 --> 03:04:35.645
You guys are cruising off in that direction.

4430
03:04:36.590 --> 03:04:38.090
Barlgura takes his turn.

4431
03:04:38.090 --> 03:04:41.920
TRAVIS: The barlgura will move 40 feet
again away from the group,

4432
03:04:41.920 --> 03:04:45.300
trying to draw the Laughing Hand as far away as possible

4433
03:04:45.300 --> 03:04:49.740
and it will use this spell he can use once a day.

4434
03:04:49.740 --> 03:04:51.610
He can do Invisibility twice a day, this one's once a day.

4435
03:04:51.610 --> 03:04:54.600
He will use Phantasmal Force.
SAM: Oh, yes.

4436
03:04:54.600 --> 03:04:57.700
TRAVIS: To-- I've never used this before.

4437
03:04:57.700 --> 03:05:00.070
It's concentration, so he's going to lose invisibility,

4438
03:05:00.070 --> 03:05:02.240
which is fine, but it's an intelligence

4439
03:05:02.240 --> 03:05:04.773
saving throw for the Laughing Hand.

4440
03:05:04.773 --> 03:05:06.160
MATT: Okay, first make a wisdom

4441
03:05:06.160 --> 03:05:08.700
saving throw for the barlgura now.

4442
03:05:08.700 --> 03:05:10.030
SAM: Oh, for the laughter.

4443
03:05:10.030 --> 03:05:11.820
MATT: Just while we're at it.
TRAVIS: Oh, okay.

4444
03:05:11.820 --> 03:05:15.570
MATT: Now the laughter's starting
to burble out from in its body.

4445
03:05:15.570 --> 03:05:16.600
TRAVIS: 18.
MATT: Yeah, that's fine.

4446
03:05:16.600 --> 03:05:17.817
TRAVIS: Okay.
MATT: All right.

4447
03:05:17.817 --> 03:05:19.443
So continue with your spell.

4448
03:05:20.420 --> 03:05:23.812
TRAVIS: You've used Phantasmal Force, what do you make?

4449
03:05:23.812 --> 03:05:26.674
LIAM: Whatever you want.
SAM: You can make

4450
03:05:26.674 --> 03:05:29.420
the Laughing Hand, if it's successful,

4451
03:05:29.420 --> 03:05:32.460
you can make the Laughing Hand imagine any--

4452
03:05:32.460 --> 03:05:34.870
like see something and believe it is real.

4453
03:05:34.870 --> 03:05:36.670
Whatever you want it to be.
LAURA: Like that he's on fire.

4454
03:05:36.670 --> 03:05:39.720
SAM: That he's on fire or that he sees the Mighty Nein or--

4455
03:05:39.720 --> 03:05:41.717
TRAVIS: Uh-huh, yeah. Yeah.

4456
03:05:41.717 --> 03:05:43.442
Yeah,

4457
03:05:43.442 --> 03:05:44.968
he sees a big-ass

4458
03:05:44.968 --> 03:05:49.000
laughing mouth that is zooming in on top of him

4459
03:05:49.000 --> 03:05:52.890
and starting to bite with rows and rows of teeth.

4460
03:05:52.890 --> 03:05:54.190
MATT: So Phantasmal Force, you said?

4461
03:05:54.190 --> 03:05:55.572
TRAVIS: Phantasmal Force.
SAM: Intelligence save.

4462
03:05:55.572 --> 03:05:57.400
Do you know what your spell

4463
03:05:57.400 --> 03:06:01.495
save thing is for this bulgie guy?

4464
03:06:01.495 --> 03:06:02.970
TRAVIS: It is, it is,

4465
03:06:02.970 --> 03:06:05.270
it's DC 13, 14.

4466
03:06:05.270 --> 03:06:06.103
LAURA: 14.

4467
03:06:06.103 --> 03:06:08.160
SAM: 14, but that's intelligence save.

4468
03:06:08.160 --> 03:06:10.320
LAURA: The Laughing Hand might be really dumb.

4469
03:06:10.320 --> 03:06:12.560
MATT: Double checking one thing right here for myself.

4470
03:06:13.785 --> 03:06:15.880
LAURA: And it would do psychic damage?

4471
03:06:15.880 --> 03:06:17.130
SAM: You craft an illusion that takes root

4472
03:06:17.130 --> 03:06:19.368
in the mind of a creature you can see.

4473
03:06:19.368 --> 03:06:20.920
It doesn't say anything about knowing language.

4474
03:06:20.920 --> 03:06:22.430
MATT: What level is it?
TRAVIS: 60 feet.

4475
03:06:22.430 --> 03:06:25.675
SAM: It's a level two illusion.

4476
03:06:28.110 --> 03:06:30.540
MATT: How did you get access to Phantasmal Force?

4477
03:06:30.540 --> 03:06:32.190
TRAVIS: It says once a day you can

4478
03:06:32.190 --> 03:06:33.990
cast Entangle or Phantasmal Force.

4479
03:06:33.990 --> 03:06:35.640
MATT: Oh, you're not casting it, the barlgura is.

4480
03:06:35.640 --> 03:06:37.710
Sorry. That's where I got confused, okay.

4481
03:06:37.710 --> 03:06:39.980
So yeah, intelligence saving throw.

4482
03:06:39.980 --> 03:06:41.410
20.

4483
03:06:41.410 --> 03:06:42.243
SAM: Damn.

4484
03:06:42.243 --> 03:06:43.950
TRAVIS: Wow. That's a smart Hand.

4485
03:06:43.950 --> 03:06:46.490
MATT: And the barlgura is no longer invisible.

4486
03:06:46.490 --> 03:06:48.415
TRAVIS: That's right.
MATT: Because it lost its spell.

4487
03:06:48.415 --> 03:06:52.230
MATT: It does get an attack
opportunity against it as it runs past.

4488
03:06:52.230 --> 03:06:53.620
With disadvantage long as it was

4489
03:06:53.620 --> 03:06:56.448
invisible at the start of it, that is a 19.

4490
03:06:56.448 --> 03:06:57.860
TRAVIS: Hits.

4491
03:06:57.860 --> 03:06:59.268
MATT: So it does take...

4492
03:07:00.920 --> 03:07:03.710
14 points of slashing damage from the blade arm

4493
03:07:03.710 --> 03:07:06.630
and the barlgura continues to run that direction.

4494
03:07:06.630 --> 03:07:07.463
All right.

4495
03:07:09.340 --> 03:07:12.010
The Laughing Hand, for its turn,

4496
03:07:12.010 --> 03:07:14.370
as it slashes away, it looks down

4497
03:07:14.370 --> 03:07:16.970
at the ground for a second and the laughter goes--

4498
03:07:16.970 --> 03:07:19.410
(cackling)

4499
03:07:19.410 --> 03:07:21.660
Begins to echo and from the shadows--

4500
03:07:21.660 --> 03:07:23.050
TALIESIN: The second I start hearing that,

4501
03:07:23.050 --> 03:07:24.960
were we within 120 feet still?

4502
03:07:24.960 --> 03:07:25.920
MATT: You were about, yeah.

4503
03:07:25.920 --> 03:07:29.150
TALIESIN: I'm just going to use my last action,
since we're 120 feet,

4504
03:07:29.150 --> 03:07:32.923
to cast a ball of Silence around the Laughing Hand.

4505
03:07:32.923 --> 03:07:34.048
MATT: Okay.

4506
03:07:34.048 --> 03:07:37.382
TALIESIN: If that's okay.
MATT: Sure.

4507
03:07:37.382 --> 03:07:38.775
It is stationary.

4508
03:07:38.775 --> 03:07:39.830
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: Yeah.

4509
03:07:39.830 --> 03:07:41.130
TALIESIN: Just right where he's standing.

4510
03:07:41.130 --> 03:07:42.300
MATT: Right where he's standing, okay.

4511
03:07:42.300 --> 03:07:44.940
So the laughter goes quiet, but from the shadows you see

4512
03:07:44.940 --> 03:07:49.300
(swooshing) three shadowy hounds that you had

4513
03:07:49.300 --> 03:07:52.180
previously seen it summon when you first fought it

4514
03:07:52.180 --> 03:07:54.821
begin to emerge and begin to scatter

4515
03:07:54.821 --> 03:07:57.020
in the direction of your troupe as you are running.

4516
03:07:57.020 --> 03:08:00.220
LAURA: I forgot about those guys, yep, yep, yep.

4517
03:08:00.220 --> 03:08:02.760
TALIESIN: Damn, I thought that might have stopped the spell.

4518
03:08:02.760 --> 03:08:05.377
MATT: It's not a spell. It's just a feature.

4519
03:08:06.540 --> 03:08:07.737
SAM: That's fine.

4520
03:08:07.737 --> 03:08:09.740
MATT: It's an ability, sorry.
TALIESIN: That's all right.

4521
03:08:09.740 --> 03:08:11.372
MATT: So the shadow hounds are now--

4522
03:08:11.372 --> 03:08:13.487
LIAM: Fog of war.
MATT: (clattering)

4523
03:08:13.487 --> 03:08:15.138
Running in your direction. You can just barely see

4524
03:08:15.138 --> 03:08:17.310
the movement through the darkness as they're darting

4525
03:08:17.310 --> 03:08:21.620
between trees and you hear the (howling), (panting)

4526
03:08:21.620 --> 03:08:23.620
getting louder and louder as you guys are running,

4527
03:08:23.620 --> 03:08:25.290
arcing around the side and the hounds

4528
03:08:25.290 --> 03:08:27.610
are trying to keep up and keep pace with you all.

4529
03:08:27.610 --> 03:08:29.150
MARISHA: They're coming after us?

4530
03:08:29.150 --> 03:08:29.983
MATT: Yes.

4531
03:08:29.983 --> 03:08:31.650
LAURA: They know where we are?

4532
03:08:31.650 --> 03:08:33.460
How do they even know where we are?

4533
03:08:33.460 --> 03:08:35.510
MATT: Because you guys are running.
LIAM: We're running, making sound.

4534
03:08:35.510 --> 03:08:38.650
MATT: You're not stealthy, you guys are full on
sprinting at the edge around away for him.

4535
03:08:38.650 --> 03:08:40.140
LAURA: Okay sorry, I thought--
MATT: So you are very much--

4536
03:08:40.140 --> 03:08:42.290
you are very visible and very audible.

4537
03:08:42.290 --> 03:08:43.700
LIAM: How close are they?

4538
03:08:43.700 --> 03:08:45.320
MATT: At this point now, if you guys went on the edge, I'd

4539
03:08:45.320 --> 03:08:48.300
say about-- and he went this way, about 100 feet from you.

4540
03:08:48.300 --> 03:08:49.330
LIAM: 100 feet.

4541
03:08:49.330 --> 03:08:50.490
MATT: Yeah.
LIAM: Okay.

4542
03:08:50.490 --> 03:08:53.830
MATT: So just be aware that that's coming.

4543
03:08:53.830 --> 03:08:54.663
MARISHA: How many?

4544
03:08:54.663 --> 03:08:55.750
TRAVIS: Three.
MARISHA: Three?

4545
03:08:55.750 --> 03:08:57.490
MATT: Three.

4546
03:08:57.490 --> 03:08:59.380
All right, so the Laughing Hand is going to go ahead--

4547
03:08:59.380 --> 03:09:01.493
LAURA: H-h-how many?
(Marisha stuttering)

4548
03:09:01.493 --> 03:09:02.600
MATT: The barlgura's taking its turn.

4549
03:09:02.600 --> 03:09:06.050
TRAVIS: It is-- he will use his full 40 feet of movement

4550
03:09:06.050 --> 03:09:09.350
to run and he will use his Running Leap,

4551
03:09:09.350 --> 03:09:12.560
which is an additional 40 feet, so 80 feet total.

4552
03:09:12.560 --> 03:09:14.010
Well, I guess if he runs and dashes

4553
03:09:14.010 --> 03:09:16.000
and does his leap, is that just 80

4554
03:09:16.000 --> 03:09:19.040
or is it also 40, 40 and 40?

4555
03:09:19.040 --> 03:09:20.960
LIAM: Holy shit, what did you just say?

4556
03:09:20.960 --> 03:09:23.140
TRAVIS: He has a thing called Running Leap--

4557
03:09:23.140 --> 03:09:26.690
It says the barlgura's long jump
is up to 40 feet when it has a running start.

4558
03:09:26.690 --> 03:09:28.710
So it'd be 40 and then he could jump another 40

4559
03:09:28.710 --> 03:09:30.440
for 80 feet total movement or is that like--

4560
03:09:30.440 --> 03:09:32.970
MATT: I'll allow it, yeah.
TRAVIS: Okay, so he'll do that

4561
03:09:32.970 --> 03:09:36.778
and bang his chest (growling), "Come on."

4562
03:09:36.778 --> 03:09:38.600
(laughter)

4563
03:09:38.600 --> 03:09:40.838
MATT: Roll an intimidation check for the barlgura.

4564
03:09:40.838 --> 03:09:42.254
LIAM: Damn, buddy.

4565
03:09:47.030 --> 03:09:49.054
TRAVIS: Intimidation is what, charisma?

4566
03:09:49.054 --> 03:09:50.678
SAM: Yeah.

4567
03:09:50.678 --> 03:09:53.956
MARISHA: Come on, I want to give you a big hug.
TRAVIS: Doesn't it have like awesome intimidation?

4568
03:09:53.956 --> 03:09:56.488
LAURA: (coos) Maybe try to grapple him instead, over.

4569
03:09:56.488 --> 03:09:58.520
MARISHA: I'm just going to grapple him.

4570
03:09:58.520 --> 03:09:59.390
TRAVIS: 13.

4571
03:09:59.390 --> 03:10:00.689
MATT: 13?

4572
03:10:00.689 --> 03:10:02.820
All right, so the barlgura runs 80 feet away,

4573
03:10:02.820 --> 03:10:05.020
leaps and lands and turns and beats its chest.

4574
03:10:05.020 --> 03:10:06.680
The hounds that have circled off to the side

4575
03:10:06.680 --> 03:10:09.580
in the silence that encapsulated and stopped its laughter,

4576
03:10:09.580 --> 03:10:12.555
the Laughing Hand looks at the barlgura,

4577
03:10:12.555 --> 03:10:14.840
looks in the direction the hounds are going,

4578
03:10:14.840 --> 03:10:17.820
smiles and goes and gives chase after the hounds.

4579
03:10:19.482 --> 03:10:20.323
TALIESIN: Damn it.

4580
03:10:20.323 --> 03:10:22.320
MATT: But you guys have-- so let's go.

4581
03:10:22.320 --> 03:10:23.461
I'm going to get another map here.

4582
03:10:23.461 --> 03:10:25.710
SAM: Oh god.
LIAM: Shit.

4583
03:10:25.710 --> 03:10:28.280
Oh shit, fog of war, motherfucker.

4584
03:10:28.280 --> 03:10:30.700
SAM: What can't be said about Dwarven Forge

4585
03:10:30.700 --> 03:10:32.550
that hasn't already been said?

4586
03:10:32.550 --> 03:10:33.960
LIAM: It's dwarfy.

4587
03:10:33.960 --> 03:10:35.240
LIAM and SAM: It's forgy.

4588
03:10:35.240 --> 03:10:36.802
TRAVIS: He was low on hit points anyways.

4589
03:10:36.802 --> 03:10:40.072
SAM: You can check out more at dwarvenforge.com.

4590
03:10:40.072 --> 03:10:41.450
MATT: You run a distraction to you guys to the point

4591
03:10:41.450 --> 03:10:43.802
where he's not between you and the path you're traveling.

4592
03:10:43.802 --> 03:10:44.930
LIAM: Oh shit.
MARISHA: It's almost dead?

4593
03:10:44.930 --> 03:10:46.830
TRAVIS: Oh yeah.
MARISHA: Shit.

4594
03:10:46.830 --> 03:10:48.155
MATT: I'm going to move that book if you don't mind.

4595
03:10:48.155 --> 03:10:48.988
LIAM: Yeah, of course.

4596
03:10:48.988 --> 03:10:50.240
MATT: Thank you.
LIAM: Oh my gosh.

4597
03:10:50.240 --> 03:10:51.470
MATT: So.
SAM: Oh my god.

4598
03:10:51.470 --> 03:10:54.395
MATT: You guys are all running on this end here.

4599
03:10:56.660 --> 03:10:58.290
SAM: Where is Yashy?

4600
03:10:58.290 --> 03:10:59.430
MATT: You're still invisible, right?

4601
03:10:59.430 --> 03:11:00.263
SAM: Yeah.

4602
03:11:00.263 --> 03:11:02.910
MATT: So you'll be, you're ahead here probably.

4603
03:11:02.910 --> 03:11:04.070
A little ways above.

4604
03:11:04.070 --> 03:11:06.720
Beauregard, a little bit further ahead.

4605
03:11:06.720 --> 03:11:09.860
So you guys have all caught up about there with,

4606
03:11:09.860 --> 03:11:11.780
oh, it's not Yasha, sorry.

4607
03:11:11.780 --> 03:11:16.692
That's Jester and Caleb all keeping in pace there.

4608
03:11:18.260 --> 03:11:19.093
All righty.

4609
03:11:20.070 --> 03:11:20.903
So...

4610
03:11:21.850 --> 03:11:23.410
SAM: We got this, guys.

4611
03:11:23.410 --> 03:11:25.240
TRAVIS: Yes and, here we go.

4612
03:11:25.240 --> 03:11:26.979
TALIESIN: Always the cheerleader.

4613
03:11:26.979 --> 03:11:29.450
SAM: Are Obann and Yasha anywhere on this map?

4614
03:11:29.450 --> 03:11:30.940
MARISHA: Where are they because we--
MATT: You don't see them.

4615
03:11:30.940 --> 03:11:32.540
MATT: They are just ahead.

4616
03:11:32.540 --> 03:11:34.797
LAURA: Already? How did they get that far ahead?

4617
03:11:34.797 --> 03:11:37.070
LIAM: Being pursued by the Laughing Hand's and his dogs.

4618
03:11:37.070 --> 03:11:38.160
TALIESIN: They were already hundreds of feet ahead.

4619
03:11:38.160 --> 03:11:39.740
TRAVIS: We were 100 feet behind them.

4620
03:11:39.740 --> 03:11:41.730
LIAM: We were running in the dark going like "What do we do?

4621
03:11:41.730 --> 03:11:43.250
"Do we do this, do we do that?"

4622
03:11:43.250 --> 03:11:45.660
MARISHA: If we run and we catch up with them--

4623
03:11:45.660 --> 03:11:47.710
MATT: Yeah, they heard you guys making noise.

4624
03:11:47.710 --> 03:11:52.050
They gave Laughing Hand his order and then they ran ahead.

4625
03:11:52.050 --> 03:11:54.050
You guys waited for him with the Laughing Hand

4626
03:11:54.050 --> 03:11:55.560
came forward and stalked the space again

4627
03:11:55.560 --> 03:11:56.750
and then that's when you summoned.

4628
03:11:56.750 --> 03:11:59.260
So they're not super ahead of you,

4629
03:11:59.260 --> 03:12:00.860
but at the moment right now as you're

4630
03:12:00.860 --> 03:12:03.056
focused on running, you do not see them.

4631
03:12:03.056 --> 03:12:06.138
But you did arc around this way

4632
03:12:06.138 --> 03:12:07.950
and so you're on a side path.

4633
03:12:07.950 --> 03:12:09.360
Nevertheless--
TALIESIN: Faster than us.

4634
03:12:09.360 --> 03:12:11.140
MATT: Let's go ahead and roll initiative.

4635
03:12:11.140 --> 03:12:11.973
LIAM: Oh shit.

4636
03:12:13.132 --> 03:12:14.732
LAURA: I'm going to barf.
TALIESIN: I know.

4637
03:12:20.450 --> 03:12:22.230
SAM: Oh boy.

4638
03:12:22.230 --> 03:12:23.168
You know.

4639
03:12:23.168 --> 03:12:27.233
LAURA: I'm literally shaking so hard,
I can't even hold my dice.

4640
03:12:27.233 --> 03:12:29.707
SAM: Well, we're not going to kill the Laughing Hand.

4641
03:12:29.707 --> 03:12:31.590
We just got to stop it.

4642
03:12:31.590 --> 03:12:33.990
TALIESIN: Thank god we have all of our spells.

4643
03:12:33.990 --> 03:12:36.210
SAM: Slow it down, something.

4644
03:12:37.070 --> 03:12:39.090
MATT: 25 to 20.

4645
03:12:39.090 --> 03:12:40.620
TALIESIN: Crickets.

4646
03:12:40.620 --> 03:12:42.860
MATT: 20 to 15.

4647
03:12:42.860 --> 03:12:44.740
SAM: 15.
LAURA: 19.

4648
03:12:44.740 --> 03:12:47.240
TRAVIS: Jester leading us off.

4649
03:12:48.153 --> 03:12:48.986
MATT: What'd you have?

4650
03:12:48.986 --> 03:12:49.819
LAURA: 19.
MATT: 19.

4651
03:12:49.819 --> 03:12:51.930
MARISHA: Oh cool, cool, cool.
LIAM: What'd you do?

4652
03:12:51.930 --> 03:12:53.540
MARISHA: I rolled two ones.

4653
03:12:53.540 --> 03:12:54.570
MATT: All right.

4654
03:12:54.570 --> 03:12:55.440
LIAM: What the fuck is going on with you?

4655
03:12:55.440 --> 03:12:57.040
MATT: You are having a rough night.

4656
03:12:57.040 --> 03:12:57.873
Okay.
SAM: Month.

4657
03:12:57.873 --> 03:12:59.910
MATT: So that brings us to--
MARISHA: Yeah, it's been awhile.

4658
03:12:59.910 --> 03:13:00.743
TRAVIS: 10 to 15.

4659
03:13:02.304 --> 03:13:03.137
10 to 15?

4660
03:13:03.137 --> 03:13:03.990
TALIESIN: 13.
LIAM: 10.

4661
03:13:03.990 --> 03:13:05.003
MATT: All right.

4662
03:13:05.003 --> 03:13:06.960
TRAVIS: Caduceus.

4663
03:13:06.960 --> 03:13:08.850
TALIESIN: Fuck, man.

4664
03:13:08.850 --> 03:13:09.683
MATT: 10 to five.

4665
03:13:10.920 --> 03:13:11.753
TRAVIS: Eight.

4666
03:13:12.930 --> 03:13:15.430
MARISHA: Seven.
LIAM: Jesus.

4667
03:13:16.730 --> 03:13:18.180
SAM: What's the play here, gang?

4668
03:13:19.070 --> 03:13:20.630
Do we stay and fight?

4669
03:13:20.630 --> 03:13:23.495
MATT: Jester, you're up first.
SAM: Run as fast as we can?

4670
03:13:23.495 --> 03:13:24.536
LAURA: I'm running.

4671
03:13:24.536 --> 03:13:25.710
MATT: You're running.

4672
03:13:25.710 --> 03:13:27.390
Double speed.

4673
03:13:27.390 --> 03:13:29.100
That's 10, 15.
MARISHA: If we run and catch up,

4674
03:13:29.100 --> 03:13:31.183
we're bringing everyone into the fight.

4675
03:13:31.183 --> 03:13:33.270
LIAM: We're bringing everyone into one, but if we stop--

4676
03:13:33.270 --> 03:13:35.990
MARISHA: If we stop--
LIAM: We are focusing on--

4677
03:13:35.990 --> 03:13:37.360
MARISHA: We're--
LIAM: The Laughing Hand and dogs.

4678
03:13:37.360 --> 03:13:42.270
MARISHA: --accurately leaning into
his distraction and fighting

4679
03:13:42.270 --> 03:13:45.240
the Laughing Hand and letting them get a head start.

4680
03:13:45.240 --> 03:13:46.780
TALIESIN: There's no good--

4681
03:13:46.780 --> 03:13:48.450
none of this is good. There's nothing good.

4682
03:13:48.450 --> 03:13:49.600
TRAVIS: Yeah.
LIAM: No.

4683
03:13:49.600 --> 03:13:51.930
SAM: Essek!

4684
03:13:51.930 --> 03:13:54.280
MATT: Because this area is thick forest,

4685
03:13:54.280 --> 03:13:58.080
it is largely considered difficult terrain.

4686
03:13:58.080 --> 03:14:00.070
So the movement is a little slow.

4687
03:14:00.070 --> 03:14:01.510
TRAVIS: Remember, he can jump.

4688
03:14:01.510 --> 03:14:04.782
MATT: But you guys are double speeding forward.

4689
03:14:04.782 --> 03:14:06.430
So that's your double movement to there, Jester.

4690
03:14:06.430 --> 03:14:08.060
That's your go.

4691
03:14:08.060 --> 03:14:09.840
The Laughing Hand.

4692
03:14:09.840 --> 03:14:12.190
LAURA: How far away was he from us. Is he--?

4693
03:14:12.190 --> 03:14:15.200
MATT: He is over this way.
LAURA: Okay, okay.

4694
03:14:15.200 --> 03:14:16.933
Okay.
TALIESIN: Oh man.

4695
03:14:16.933 --> 03:14:20.870
Also, there's still a creature chasing him, I assume.

4696
03:14:20.870 --> 03:14:23.945
MATT: There are three shadow hounds heading this way.

4697
03:14:23.945 --> 03:14:25.590
TALIESIN: Jesus.

4698
03:14:25.590 --> 03:14:26.450
Good to note.

4699
03:14:26.450 --> 03:14:31.029
MATT: The Laughing Hand takes his turn, runs

4700
03:14:31.029 --> 03:14:32.504
and jumps.

4701
03:14:34.080 --> 03:14:36.480
All right, so that brings us to Nott.

4702
03:14:36.480 --> 03:14:38.710
SAM: Double dash run forward.

4703
03:14:38.710 --> 03:14:39.543
MATT: Okay.

4704
03:14:40.654 --> 03:14:42.714
Five, ten, 15,

4705
03:14:42.714 --> 03:14:43.547
20.

4706
03:14:44.638 --> 03:14:46.850
Oh, that would be 15.
TALIESIN: Fuck, man.

4707
03:14:46.850 --> 03:14:48.500
MATT: Puts you about there as you're pushing

4708
03:14:48.500 --> 03:14:50.590
through the rough terrain and having to jump over

4709
03:14:50.590 --> 03:14:53.560
bits of bushes and roots and the harshness

4710
03:14:53.560 --> 03:14:57.490
and difficult floor of the Lotusden Greenwood itself.

4711
03:14:57.490 --> 03:15:00.030
SAM: I only can run 30 feet?

4712
03:15:00.030 --> 03:15:01.990
MATT: 30 feet.
SAM: Well, 35 feet?

4713
03:15:01.990 --> 03:15:03.020
MATT: 35 feet total,

4714
03:15:03.020 --> 03:15:04.930
but then it's half speed and I'm saying

4715
03:15:04.930 --> 03:15:07.630
that would put you at about 15 feet per movement.

4716
03:15:07.630 --> 03:15:09.680
You can use your bonus action to dash.

4717
03:15:09.680 --> 03:15:11.440
SAM: Oh yeah, of course.

4718
03:15:11.440 --> 03:15:13.740
MATT: So there, that gets you to there, all right.

4719
03:15:14.640 --> 03:15:16.170
It's now the hounds' turn.

4720
03:15:16.170 --> 03:15:19.095
They do not suffer issues with the rough terrain.

4721
03:15:20.710 --> 03:15:23.160
They get not quite, but they're lapping

4722
03:15:23.160 --> 03:15:26.040
at the heels of Caleb, Caduceus, and Fjord.

4723
03:15:26.040 --> 03:15:27.890
LIAM: What's their range from us?

4724
03:15:27.890 --> 03:15:31.280
MATT: I'd say they're about 20 or so feet behind you guys.

4725
03:15:31.280 --> 03:15:33.450
That brings us to Caduceus with Caleb on deck.

4726
03:15:33.450 --> 03:15:34.570
What are you doing, buddy?

4727
03:15:35.964 --> 03:15:37.264
TRAVIS: Yeah, we got to fight them.

4728
03:15:37.264 --> 03:15:38.806
We at least have to fight the hounds.

4729
03:15:40.056 --> 03:15:41.556
TALIESIN: I'm--

4730
03:15:41.556 --> 03:15:42.490
fuck, man.
MARISHA: If we try and fight and run.

4731
03:15:42.490 --> 03:15:44.479
Fight while we run.

4732
03:15:44.479 --> 03:15:45.800
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4733
03:15:45.800 --> 03:15:47.840
TALIESIN: Are we double speeding here or--

4734
03:15:47.840 --> 03:15:49.930
I suppose I'm keeping pace with everybody.

4735
03:15:49.930 --> 03:15:50.990
Fuck, why am I next?

4736
03:15:50.990 --> 03:15:52.605
That's so fucked.

4737
03:15:52.605 --> 03:15:55.500
TRAVIS: You need one minute to do what?

4738
03:15:55.500 --> 03:15:57.415
LAURA: To teleport us away.

4739
03:15:57.415 --> 03:15:59.500
LIAM: That's gone.
TALIESIN: Sorry.

4740
03:15:59.500 --> 03:16:02.303
How close are they at this point?

4741
03:16:02.303 --> 03:16:03.870
MATT: What's up?
TALIESIN: How close are the hounds?

4742
03:16:03.870 --> 03:16:04.720
MATT: About 20 feet behind you.

4743
03:16:04.720 --> 03:16:06.461
TALIESIN: About 20 feet behind me

4744
03:16:06.461 --> 03:16:08.200
and they are way faster than I am.

4745
03:16:08.200 --> 03:16:09.033
I can tell.

4746
03:16:09.033 --> 03:16:10.230
MATT: Yeah.

4747
03:16:10.230 --> 03:16:11.240
TALIESIN: Okay.

4748
03:16:11.240 --> 03:16:15.350
MATT: They're not held by the
difficulty of this forest terrain.

4749
03:16:15.350 --> 03:16:18.140
TALIESIN: Shit, so even at double speed--

4750
03:16:18.140 --> 03:16:18.973
MATT: They're going to catch up to you.

4751
03:16:18.973 --> 03:16:19.880
TALIESIN: They're going to catch up to me next round.

4752
03:16:19.880 --> 03:16:21.670
MATT: Now, mind you, you've fought them before

4753
03:16:21.670 --> 03:16:24.740
and you know they weren't extremely powerful.

4754
03:16:24.740 --> 03:16:25.573
They were,

4755
03:16:26.740 --> 03:16:28.430
you know, fairly

4756
03:16:29.470 --> 03:16:30.560
annoying.

4757
03:16:30.560 --> 03:16:33.880
SAM: Can anyone turn them against their master or anything?

4758
03:16:33.880 --> 03:16:35.660
MATT: What are you doing, Caduceus, what you doing?

4759
03:16:35.660 --> 03:16:37.420
TALIESIN: I'm going to--
MARISHA: Run and fight.

4760
03:16:37.420 --> 03:16:38.530
TRAVIS: I know how <i>I</i> feel, but

4761
03:16:38.530 --> 03:16:40.830
would we consider the Laughing Hand a monster?

4762
03:16:42.220 --> 03:16:45.520
MATT: He's considered a creature, a monster, yeah.

4763
03:16:45.520 --> 03:16:49.330
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Bane on the three of them

4764
03:16:49.330 --> 03:16:52.030
since they're right there and since it currently matters.

4765
03:16:52.030 --> 03:16:53.480
MARISHA: You've got the cold sweats.

4766
03:16:54.900 --> 03:16:58.080
MATT: Bane on all three of them. You got it.

4767
03:16:58.080 --> 03:17:00.620
TALIESIN: They actually do have a save
against it, I should mention.

4768
03:17:00.620 --> 03:17:02.610
MATT: Oh right, so wisdom?

4769
03:17:02.610 --> 03:17:03.660
TALIESIN: Charisma.

4770
03:17:03.660 --> 03:17:05.850
MATT: Charisma, oh, they're terrible at that.

4771
03:17:06.740 --> 03:17:08.190
Fail.
MARISHA: But they're so cute.

4772
03:17:09.480 --> 03:17:10.620
MATT: Fail.

4773
03:17:10.620 --> 03:17:11.790
16?
TALIESIN: Nope.

4774
03:17:11.790 --> 03:17:13.440
MATT: Fail, all three of them are Baned.

4775
03:17:13.440 --> 03:17:15.820
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to take my full movement

4776
03:17:15.820 --> 03:17:17.900
in whatever direction seems like--

4777
03:17:17.900 --> 03:17:19.400
MATT: That'll get you about there.

4778
03:17:20.420 --> 03:17:22.060
TALIESIN: Ah, hell.

4779
03:17:22.060 --> 03:17:23.354
And...

4780
03:17:23.354 --> 03:17:25.820
SAM: (nervous laughter)

4781
03:17:25.820 --> 03:17:26.880
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah.

4782
03:17:26.880 --> 03:17:27.960
MATT: That finishes your turn, Caduceus?

4783
03:17:27.960 --> 03:17:29.840
TALIESIN: I think it does.
MATT: Caleb, you're up.

4784
03:17:29.840 --> 03:17:32.540
LAURA: If I was doing my full movement and used my

4785
03:17:32.540 --> 03:17:34.510
bonus action to do the movement, that's as far as I would--

4786
03:17:34.510 --> 03:17:35.840
MATT: You can't use your bonus action to move.

4787
03:17:35.840 --> 03:17:37.300
LAURA: Oh, that's only a rogue.
MATT: Only rogues can do that.

4788
03:17:37.300 --> 03:17:38.433
LAURA: Got it.

4789
03:17:39.901 --> 03:17:40.870
TALIESIN: Fuck, man.

4790
03:17:40.870 --> 03:17:44.520
LIAM: I would like to run on a diagonal this way.

4791
03:17:44.520 --> 03:17:45.590
Five, 10, 15.

4792
03:17:46.560 --> 03:17:48.190
25, 30.

4793
03:17:48.190 --> 03:17:49.067
MATT: It's rough terrain.

4794
03:17:49.067 --> 03:17:50.610
MATT: You move half speed.
LIAM: Okay, got it.

4795
03:17:50.610 --> 03:17:52.070
MATT: Yeah.

4796
03:17:52.070 --> 03:17:55.340
Because you're having to jump over all the shit that's

4797
03:17:55.340 --> 03:17:58.204
been growing and filling in the bottom of this forest.

4798
03:17:58.204 --> 03:17:59.600
TRAVIS: We're all running and tripping and falling.

4799
03:17:59.600 --> 03:18:02.800
LIAM: I pull out not my spellbook,

4800
03:18:02.800 --> 03:18:07.300
but the other book and I start casting and muttering

4801
03:18:07.300 --> 03:18:11.005
arcane words and cast Banishment on the Laughing Hand.

4802
03:18:11.890 --> 03:18:13.680
MATT: On the Laughing Hand?
LIAM: Yeah.

4803
03:18:13.680 --> 03:18:14.513
MATT: Okay.

4804
03:18:14.513 --> 03:18:17.320
SAM: Come on, work.

4805
03:18:17.320 --> 03:18:19.530
LAURA: Oh my god, if it works.

4806
03:18:19.530 --> 03:18:20.540
TRAVIS: What is it?

4807
03:18:20.540 --> 03:18:22.190
MATT: What is that, is that a--
LIAM: 17.

4808
03:18:22.190 --> 03:18:23.440
MATT: 17 wisdom?

4809
03:18:23.440 --> 03:18:25.128
MARISHA: I think it's a will save.

4810
03:18:25.128 --> 03:18:27.010
LIAM: It's charisma.

4811
03:18:27.010 --> 03:18:27.843
MATT: Charisma.

4812
03:18:27.843 --> 03:18:29.970
TRAVIS: Remember he had high, really--

4813
03:18:30.850 --> 03:18:33.070
LAURA: He had high of certain--
MATT: Natural 19.

4814
03:18:33.070 --> 03:18:34.350
Plus a lot, so--

4815
03:18:34.350 --> 03:18:35.200
SAM: Damn.
MATT: Sorry.

4816
03:18:35.200 --> 03:18:36.180
LIAM: Done.
MATT: Sorry.

4817
03:18:36.180 --> 03:18:37.030
LIAM: It's fine.

4818
03:18:37.030 --> 03:18:38.640
MARISHA: Plus 11, is that what you said?

4819
03:18:38.640 --> 03:18:39.880
MATT: No, I said plus a lot.

4820
03:18:39.880 --> 03:18:41.190
MARISHA: Plus a lot.

4821
03:18:41.190 --> 03:18:42.230
LAURA: He's got super high charisma?

4822
03:18:42.230 --> 03:18:43.370
MATT: Fjord, you're up.

4823
03:18:43.370 --> 03:18:44.404
LAURA: I wouldn't have thought that about him?

4824
03:18:44.404 --> 03:18:46.680
MARISHA: Ha ha ha, the laughing, I don't know.

4825
03:18:46.680 --> 03:18:47.800
He's the funny guy at a party.

4826
03:18:47.800 --> 03:18:50.040
MATT: Charisma isn't always appearance.

4827
03:18:50.040 --> 03:18:52.810
Sometimes it's just force of terrible--

4828
03:18:52.810 --> 03:18:54.760
SAM: The personality.
MATT: --personality and presence.

4829
03:18:54.760 --> 03:18:55.593
LIAM: Force of will.

4830
03:18:56.659 --> 03:18:57.775
TRAVIS: I will...

4831
03:18:59.710 --> 03:19:02.330
TALIESIN: They use pack tactics, too. I do remember that.

4832
03:19:02.330 --> 03:19:05.690
TRAVIS: I will run in that diagonal.

4833
03:19:06.907 --> 03:19:08.751
Five, 10, 15.

4834
03:19:08.751 --> 03:19:09.584
MATT: 15, you're there.

4835
03:19:09.584 --> 03:19:11.025
TRAVIS: Cool, and I can't see the squares,

4836
03:19:11.025 --> 03:19:13.740
am I about 30 feet from the Hand?

4837
03:19:13.740 --> 03:19:16.250
MATT: I'd say you're about 30, 35 feet from him, yeah.

4838
03:19:16.250 --> 03:19:18.140
TRAVIS: Okay, if I'm 30, fuck it,

4839
03:19:18.140 --> 03:19:21.960
I'm going to try and cast Charm Monster on the Hand

4840
03:19:21.960 --> 03:19:24.380
and the hound that is nearest to him.

4841
03:19:24.380 --> 03:19:26.542
MATT: Oh, interesting.

4842
03:19:27.850 --> 03:19:29.458
MARISHA: Make him your friend.

4843
03:19:30.480 --> 03:19:31.313
MATT: Okay.

4844
03:19:32.658 --> 03:19:33.491
SAM: Come on, come on.

4845
03:19:33.491 --> 03:19:34.324
MATT: Charm Monster.

4846
03:19:34.324 --> 03:19:36.170
SAM: Roll low, Matt, roll low.
TRAVIS: It's a wisdom save?

4847
03:19:36.170 --> 03:19:37.040
TRAVIS: Yeah, 17.

4848
03:19:37.040 --> 03:19:38.010
LAURA: Roll a one.

4849
03:19:39.440 --> 03:19:41.560
MATT: That is a nine. That's a failure.

4850
03:19:41.560 --> 03:19:42.393
LIAM: Yes.
(gasping)

4851
03:19:42.393 --> 03:19:44.617
SAM: For the Hand?
MATT: For the Hand.

4852
03:19:44.617 --> 03:19:47.140
LIAM: Yes, yes.
SAM: Whoa, game changer.

4853
03:19:47.140 --> 03:19:47.973
LIAM: Game changer.

4854
03:19:47.973 --> 03:19:49.190
MATT: Okay.

4855
03:19:49.190 --> 03:19:51.385
Let me look up the specifics here.

4856
03:19:52.540 --> 03:19:53.520
MARISHA: Lordy.

4857
03:19:53.520 --> 03:19:55.304
LAURA: I have to pee again.

4858
03:19:55.304 --> 03:19:56.282
(laughter)

4859
03:19:56.282 --> 03:19:57.404
TALIESIN: So badly.

4860
03:19:57.404 --> 03:19:59.170
SAM: We're not taking another break, Laura!

4861
03:20:00.527 --> 03:20:02.264
Here, this is empty.

4862
03:20:02.264 --> 03:20:04.339
LAURA: (laughs)

4863
03:20:04.339 --> 03:20:06.650
MATT: It lasts for one hour, it is concentration.

4864
03:20:06.650 --> 03:20:07.660
SAM: An hour?

4865
03:20:07.660 --> 03:20:09.030
LIAM and SAM: Game changer.

4866
03:20:09.030 --> 03:20:11.320
LAURA: It's concentration, though,
so we have to protect Fjord

4867
03:20:11.320 --> 03:20:12.910
from the other hounds.

4868
03:20:12.910 --> 03:20:14.170
MATT: It does so with advantage

4869
03:20:14.170 --> 03:20:16.310
if your companions are fighting it.

4870
03:20:16.310 --> 03:20:17.800
SAM and LAURA: We haven't fought it.

4871
03:20:17.800 --> 03:20:18.970
MATT: You're

4872
03:20:18.970 --> 03:20:19.890
in--
SAM: We haven't fought it.

4873
03:20:19.890 --> 03:20:21.392
MARISHA: We haven't fought it.

4874
03:20:21.392 --> 03:20:22.700
LIAM: It fought off a spell from me.

4875
03:20:22.700 --> 03:20:24.640
MATT: It's been fighting a
barlgura that was summoned by you.

4876
03:20:24.640 --> 03:20:26.140
You're fighting it.

4877
03:20:27.150 --> 03:20:28.900
That's still a 14.

4878
03:20:28.900 --> 03:20:29.733
LIAM: Yes!

4879
03:20:31.680 --> 03:20:33.055
MATT: Shit! Okay.

4880
03:20:34.012 --> 03:20:35.465
Okay.
MARISHA: Oh my god.

4881
03:20:35.465 --> 03:20:37.704
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: Oh my god.

4882
03:20:37.704 --> 03:20:41.470
MATT: Okay, so the creature for the
next hour is charmed by you.

4883
03:20:41.470 --> 03:20:42.890
LIAM: Yes!

4884
03:20:42.890 --> 03:20:43.723
MATT: Here.

4885
03:20:43.723 --> 03:20:45.293
TRAVIS: Do not do anything harmful to it.

4886
03:20:45.293 --> 03:20:46.126
MATT: Here...

4887
03:20:51.650 --> 03:20:53.780
Go ahead and make a d20 check,

4888
03:20:53.780 --> 03:20:57.840
adding your spell modifier, which is your charisma bonus.

4889
03:20:57.840 --> 03:20:59.270
LAURA: Okay, you're very charming.
MARISHA: But why.

4890
03:20:59.270 --> 03:21:00.350
LAURA: Fjord is incredibly charming.

4891
03:21:00.350 --> 03:21:01.970
MATT: There's a reason for this.
LAURA: Can I guide him?

4892
03:21:01.970 --> 03:21:03.230
No, I can't touch him right now.

4893
03:21:03.230 --> 03:21:04.180
MARISHA: There's a reason?

4894
03:21:05.550 --> 03:21:07.080
TRAVIS: Oh god.

4895
03:21:07.080 --> 03:21:08.020
It's a nine.

4896
03:21:08.020 --> 03:21:09.560
MARISHA: You've been rolling so well all game.

4897
03:21:09.560 --> 03:21:10.800
SAM: Wait, plus your charisma?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4898
03:21:10.800 --> 03:21:11.840
MATT: Plus your charisma modifier?

4899
03:21:11.840 --> 03:21:14.240
TRAVIS: That's a four plus five.

4900
03:21:14.240 --> 03:21:15.080
MATT: Hilariously--

4901
03:21:16.800 --> 03:21:19.080
you've had some fucking luck tonight.

4902
03:21:19.080 --> 03:21:20.220
Okay so--

4903
03:21:20.220 --> 03:21:21.053
SAM: That's okay.

4904
03:21:21.053 --> 03:21:22.480
MATT: So the spell continues through.

4905
03:21:22.480 --> 03:21:24.270
The charm is successful.

4906
03:21:24.270 --> 03:21:26.420
LIAM: What was that?
MARISHA: What was that, though?

4907
03:21:26.420 --> 03:21:29.380
TALIESIN: It might have been an attempt to, yeah.

4908
03:21:29.380 --> 03:21:32.210
SAM: It gets some sort of bonus that it didn't give it.

4909
03:21:32.210 --> 03:21:35.470
MARISHA: Does it get like legendary resistance?

4910
03:21:35.470 --> 03:21:38.084
MATT: It doesn't have legendary resistance necessarily.

4911
03:21:38.084 --> 03:21:39.615
MARISHA: "Necessarily."

4912
03:21:39.615 --> 03:21:40.915
MATT: You don't know.
LIAM: Next.

4913
03:21:41.752 --> 03:21:44.470
MATT: Regardless, the spell works.

4914
03:21:44.470 --> 03:21:46.486
LAURA: Tell him to call off his hounds.

4915
03:21:46.486 --> 03:21:47.790
MATT: Yeah,

4916
03:21:47.790 --> 03:21:49.460
I mean can I say

4917
03:21:49.460 --> 03:21:51.490
don't attack my--

4918
03:21:51.490 --> 03:21:52.950
don't attack my friends,

4919
03:21:52.950 --> 03:21:55.210
call off your wards?

4920
03:21:55.210 --> 03:21:56.790
MATT: All right, so as you stand there

4921
03:21:56.790 --> 03:21:58.750
putting your hands forward and say that,

4922
03:21:58.750 --> 03:22:01.790
the Laughing Hand (stomping)

4923
03:22:01.790 --> 03:22:04.007
comes barreling up towards you.

4924
03:22:07.068 --> 03:22:09.412
(low laughter)

4925
03:22:09.412 --> 03:22:11.160
And is just staring right down at you.

4926
03:22:11.160 --> 03:22:13.490
It stands at about roughly--

4927
03:22:13.490 --> 03:22:16.360
you're guessing at about 10 to 12 feet tall.

4928
03:22:16.360 --> 03:22:18.602
TRAVIS: Faint sweat drop.

4929
03:22:18.602 --> 03:22:21.110
LIAM: That saved our bacon.

4930
03:22:21.110 --> 03:22:23.250
MATT: The hounds which are following (clomping)

4931
03:22:23.250 --> 03:22:28.060
run past you and then curve back around and join the Hand.

4932
03:22:28.060 --> 03:22:30.064
SAM: What?

4933
03:22:30.064 --> 03:22:31.360
TALIESIN: This is an hour?

4934
03:22:31.360 --> 03:22:32.890
TRAVIS: I'm going to stay right here and I'm going to

4935
03:22:32.890 --> 03:22:37.042
turn to the group and go: You have an hour.

4936
03:22:37.974 --> 03:22:38.807
Go.

4937
03:22:38.807 --> 03:22:40.430
MARISHA: Are you not coming with us?
TALIESIN: Wait.

4938
03:22:40.430 --> 03:22:42.550
This is an opportunity.

4939
03:22:42.550 --> 03:22:44.140
TRAVIS: For what?

4940
03:22:44.140 --> 03:22:46.595
SAM: For comedy.
LIAM: And assault.

4941
03:22:46.595 --> 03:22:47.711
TALIESIN: For two things.

4942
03:22:47.711 --> 03:22:49.560
TRAVIS: You hit it, it breaks.

4943
03:22:49.560 --> 03:22:50.940
LAURA: Nobody attack it.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4944
03:22:50.940 --> 03:22:53.060
TALIESIN: Can it talk?

4945
03:22:53.060 --> 03:22:56.400
SAM: It's not, you can't, it's not a control spell.

4946
03:22:56.400 --> 03:22:57.233
LAURA: No.
SAM: He's just friends with him.

4947
03:22:57.233 --> 03:22:58.670
MATT: Are you guys still running or are you staying--

4948
03:22:58.670 --> 03:23:00.760
LAURA: Yes, we're still running.

4949
03:23:00.760 --> 03:23:03.370
TALIESIN: Just a second, I'm talking to him before we break.

4950
03:23:03.370 --> 03:23:05.970
MATT: Everyone else is still running, just so you know.

4951
03:23:05.970 --> 03:23:08.030
Are you running with the rest or are you staying put?

4952
03:23:09.910 --> 03:23:10.820
LAURA: Just ask him to stay.

4953
03:23:10.820 --> 03:23:12.880
LIAM: Tell it to run away

4954
03:23:12.880 --> 03:23:14.660
in the opposite directioN as fast as it can.

4955
03:23:14.660 --> 03:23:17.210
TRAVIS: I don't think it obeys you;
it's just friendly to you.

4956
03:23:17.210 --> 03:23:18.640
MATT: Yeah it's friendly, it's not dominated.

4957
03:23:18.640 --> 03:23:19.970
LIAM: Oh, oh, oh, oh.

4958
03:23:21.650 --> 03:23:22.950
TALIESIN: Can you ask it its name?

4959
03:23:24.000 --> 03:23:24.860
LAURA: Its name is Ganix.

4960
03:23:24.860 --> 03:23:26.110
TRAVIS: I don't want it to talk to me.

4961
03:23:26.110 --> 03:23:28.580
That's how that shit happens, it was like (gibbering).

4962
03:23:28.580 --> 03:23:30.600
LAURA: His name is Ganix.

4963
03:23:30.600 --> 03:23:31.920
TALIESIN: I guess we can--

4964
03:23:31.920 --> 03:23:33.570
MATT: What are you doing, guys?
TRAVIS: Just go.

4965
03:23:33.570 --> 03:23:34.950
TALIESIN: Just go, fuck it.

4966
03:23:34.950 --> 03:23:37.314
TRAVIS: I'm going to stay.

4967
03:23:37.314 --> 03:23:38.485
MARISHA: Oh!

4968
03:23:38.485 --> 03:23:39.318
TALIESIN: Why?

4969
03:23:39.318 --> 03:23:40.151
MARISHA: Okay, okay, I'm running.

4970
03:23:40.151 --> 03:23:40.984
LAURA: Don't stay.

4971
03:23:40.984 --> 03:23:43.200
TRAVIS: I'm going to walk after them as they are darting

4972
03:23:43.200 --> 03:23:44.700
and I'll watch what the Hand is doing.

4973
03:23:44.700 --> 03:23:48.400
Is he staying with me or is he staying where he is?

4974
03:23:48.400 --> 03:23:50.490
MATT: No, he's traveling with you guys.

4975
03:23:50.490 --> 03:23:53.020
As they're all running and if you're running with them--

4976
03:23:53.020 --> 03:23:53.940
TRAVIS: He's coming with us, let's go.

4977
03:23:53.940 --> 03:23:55.580
MATT: It's up to you.
TRAVIS: He's coming with us.

4978
03:23:55.580 --> 03:23:57.470
Yeah, good boy, don't trip and fall.

4979
03:23:57.470 --> 03:23:58.303
MATT: Okay.

4980
03:23:58.303 --> 03:24:00.740
SAM: You're bringing him with us?

4981
03:24:00.740 --> 03:24:02.430
MARISHA: It's not a dominate.

4982
03:24:02.430 --> 03:24:05.730
TALIESIN: No, but I think you can ask him to do stuff.

4983
03:24:05.730 --> 03:24:09.830
MARISHA: Tell him fuck Obann, Obann's a piece of shit.

4984
03:24:09.830 --> 03:24:11.928
Fight Obann with us.

4985
03:24:11.928 --> 03:24:13.086
SAM: It's not a dominate.

4986
03:24:13.086 --> 03:24:15.130
TRAVIS: You would understand charming a creature

4987
03:24:15.130 --> 03:24:18.250
means the creature treats you as a friend

4988
03:24:18.250 --> 03:24:20.310
and your intent as a friend.

4989
03:24:20.310 --> 03:24:22.220
That doesn't mean that it follows

4990
03:24:22.220 --> 03:24:23.470
all of your commands and it doesn't mean

4991
03:24:23.470 --> 03:24:26.160
that it hates anybody else that it sees as an ally.

4992
03:24:26.160 --> 03:24:27.920
TALIESIN: So why don't we just tell him

4993
03:24:27.920 --> 03:24:30.270
that we need him to go on a mission?

4994
03:24:30.270 --> 03:24:31.500
TRAVIS: I need him to come--

4995
03:24:31.500 --> 03:24:34.230
LIAM: Ask him as a favor to go check something out.

4996
03:24:34.230 --> 03:24:36.488
TRAVIS: To go check it out,
or to come with us and protect us.

4997
03:24:36.488 --> 03:24:38.080
LIAM: That's not going to last.

4998
03:24:38.080 --> 03:24:40.060
If he gets bonked in the head, it's done.

4999
03:24:40.060 --> 03:24:42.900
MARISHA: Well, we just got to get
in and out in under an hour.

5000
03:24:42.900 --> 03:24:45.080
TRAVIS: Or if your companions do anything harmful to it.

5001
03:24:45.080 --> 03:24:46.540
It doesn't say anything about his companions.

5002
03:24:46.540 --> 03:24:48.420
TALIESIN: No, but he won't attack his friends.

5003
03:24:48.420 --> 03:24:51.160
TRAVIS: No, I don't want him to. Just protect us.

5004
03:24:51.160 --> 03:24:53.700
MATT: If other creatures attack him, he's still charmed.

5005
03:24:53.700 --> 03:24:54.720
It doesn't break his charm,

5006
03:24:54.720 --> 03:24:56.720
it's if any of you guys or you do anything.

5007
03:24:56.720 --> 03:24:58.590
LAURA: So we can say, "Hey, don't let

5008
03:24:58.590 --> 03:25:00.840
"your other friends hurt your new friends."

5009
03:25:00.840 --> 03:25:05.840
TALIESIN: That might get weird and again, in an hour--

5010
03:25:05.885 --> 03:25:07.010
TRAVIS: Just bringing him with us.
MARISHA: Yeah, we got it.

5011
03:25:07.010 --> 03:25:09.147
We're going, we're going.

5012
03:25:09.147 --> 03:25:10.280
TRAVIS: I need to see where we're going.

5013
03:25:10.280 --> 03:25:11.950
LIAM: Yeah, okay.
MATT: You guys continue.

5014
03:25:11.950 --> 03:25:12.990
You've arced off to the side

5015
03:25:12.990 --> 03:25:14.750
and you're circling around the path.

5016
03:25:14.750 --> 03:25:17.330
LAURA: I just think once Obann sees him, he's going to

5017
03:25:17.330 --> 03:25:19.980
be able to overpower whatever it is you're doing to him.

5018
03:25:19.980 --> 03:25:20.813
TRAVIS: That's a fair point.

5019
03:25:20.813 --> 03:25:22.660
LAURA: I saw what he did to Yasha, it's pretty powerful.

5020
03:25:22.660 --> 03:25:23.991
SAM: Hang back.

5021
03:25:23.991 --> 03:25:25.150
TRAVIS: I'm going to stay 150 feet behind you guys.

5022
03:25:25.150 --> 03:25:26.490
LAURA: Just ask him if he'll hang back.

5023
03:25:26.490 --> 03:25:28.361
TRAVIS: Just 150 feet behind you guys.

5024
03:25:28.361 --> 03:25:30.740
TALIESIN: Do you need to be near it for it to work?

5025
03:25:30.740 --> 03:25:31.860
SAM: He'll figure that out as he walks.

5026
03:25:31.860 --> 03:25:35.970
LIAM: Also Fjord, maybe he doesn't need his dogs anymore.

5027
03:25:35.970 --> 03:25:38.728
TRAVIS: Maybe you don't need your dogs anymore.

5028
03:25:39.869 --> 03:25:40.920
MATT: Are you trying to convince him to get rid of them?

5029
03:25:40.920 --> 03:25:42.120
Make a persuasion check.

5030
03:25:43.280 --> 03:25:44.500
TALIESIN: I'm definitely tapping you.

5031
03:25:44.500 --> 03:25:46.427
I'm tapping you, Fjord, before.
LAURA: Guidance, guidance.

5032
03:25:46.427 --> 03:25:48.227
You've got guidance.

5033
03:25:49.077 --> 03:25:50.830
LIAM: (like "You've got mail") You've got guidance.

5034
03:25:50.830 --> 03:25:53.360
TRAVIS: 21, with guidance.
MATT: As you're running,

5035
03:25:53.360 --> 03:25:55.090
it looks back and you, you can see the grin

5036
03:25:55.090 --> 03:25:56.830
on its chin and you see its secondary mouth

5037
03:25:56.830 --> 03:25:59.780
open up here and (raspy laughing).

5038
03:25:59.780 --> 03:26:02.120
As it does, it raises its non-blade hand

5039
03:26:02.120 --> 03:26:03.420
and does like this motion

5040
03:26:03.420 --> 03:26:07.126
and you watch as the hounds running (clomping)

5041
03:26:07.126 --> 03:26:10.340
just vanish into smoke and shadow and then dissipate

5042
03:26:10.340 --> 03:26:13.430
as the fog and mist slowly coalesces.

5043
03:26:13.430 --> 03:26:14.980
SAM: No talking. Let's go!

5044
03:26:14.980 --> 03:26:16.342
LAURA: We're running as we're saying it.

5045
03:26:16.342 --> 03:26:17.561
TRAVIS: Keep going, keep going.
SAM: No, we're not.

5046
03:26:17.561 --> 03:26:18.394
TALIESIN: I am.
SAM: He's standing there.

5047
03:26:18.394 --> 03:26:20.420
TRAVIS: No, keep running, keep running.

5048
03:26:20.420 --> 03:26:23.000
I stop, keep running, just keep running, just keep running!

5049
03:26:23.000 --> 03:26:24.800
I'll turn around to him and I'll say:

5050
03:26:25.660 --> 03:26:28.460
What my friends and I are doing is very important.

5051
03:26:28.460 --> 03:26:30.430
I saw you keeping a perimeter earlier

5052
03:26:30.430 --> 03:26:34.577
and it was expertly done. You and I will do the same.

5053
03:26:35.650 --> 03:26:38.710
Form a wide circle. Let's stay at least

5054
03:26:38.710 --> 03:26:43.260
within bare eyeshot of where we end up.

5055
03:26:43.260 --> 03:26:47.392
No one gets in. You're the first line of defense.

5056
03:26:49.434 --> 03:26:50.450
MATT: And he just cuts the arm through

5057
03:26:50.450 --> 03:26:53.233
one of the lowest nearby trees

5058
03:26:53.233 --> 03:26:56.400
and the tree (crunching), (thudding),

5059
03:26:56.400 --> 03:26:58.430
slams into the ground.
TRAVIS: Laura's going to forgive that.

5060
03:26:58.430 --> 03:27:01.337
It's okay.
(laughter)

5061
03:27:01.337 --> 03:27:03.160
MATT: And it continues running off in the direction.

5062
03:27:03.160 --> 03:27:05.530
LIAM: It's about time.
MATT: Following your instructions.

5063
03:27:05.530 --> 03:27:06.938
TRAVIS: Okay.

5064
03:27:06.938 --> 03:27:09.240
All right, and I'll try and catch up to the group.

5065
03:27:09.240 --> 03:27:10.073
MATT: Okay.

5066
03:27:11.740 --> 03:27:13.630
You guys are running and as you're running,

5067
03:27:13.630 --> 03:27:16.920
you can hear the (stomping) of the Laughing Hand

5068
03:27:16.920 --> 03:27:19.870
with the distant weird phasing chuckles.

5069
03:27:19.870 --> 03:27:22.470
LAURA: I think as we come up, we should get stealthy again.

5070
03:27:24.200 --> 03:27:25.180
They're going to think that nobody

5071
03:27:25.180 --> 03:27:26.540
could get through the Laughing Hand.

5072
03:27:26.540 --> 03:27:29.450
He's not back yet. There's fighting in the distance.

5073
03:27:29.450 --> 03:27:33.190
They're not going to be thinking that we're getting to them.

5074
03:27:33.190 --> 03:27:35.580
LIAM: What if he leads the charge?

5075
03:27:35.580 --> 03:27:37.550
MARISHA: The Laughing Hand?
LIAM: And we're behind him, yeah.

5076
03:27:37.550 --> 03:27:39.130
SAM: He's not going to attack his friends.

5077
03:27:39.130 --> 03:27:40.210
LIAM: That's what I'm saying.

5078
03:27:40.210 --> 03:27:42.798
MARISHA: But he would be a nice guise.

5079
03:27:42.798 --> 03:27:45.648
LIAM: They'll think they're hearing him and not us.

5080
03:27:47.280 --> 03:27:48.993
MARISHA: I get what you're laying down.

5081
03:27:48.993 --> 03:27:51.120
TALIESIN: Can't we just teleport?
SAM: Do this for ourselves.

5082
03:27:53.150 --> 03:27:56.400
MARISHA: Yeah, just use the tools at our disposal.

5083
03:27:56.400 --> 03:27:58.320
MATT: Who's leading this journey through

5084
03:27:58.320 --> 03:28:00.400
the middle of the forest, by the way?

5085
03:28:00.400 --> 03:28:01.233
LIAM: Fjord.

5086
03:28:01.233 --> 03:28:02.480
SAM: I've been running this whole time.

5087
03:28:02.480 --> 03:28:03.410
SAM: But you're invisible.

5088
03:28:03.410 --> 03:28:05.383
So you're not guiding anybody.

5089
03:28:05.383 --> 03:28:07.417
LAURA: I was in front and Beau was probably in front.

5090
03:28:07.417 --> 03:28:08.910
MATT: All right, so Beau and Jester--

5091
03:28:08.910 --> 03:28:10.250
MARISHA: Try and banish him?

5092
03:28:10.250 --> 03:28:11.976
LIAM: I could send him away--

5093
03:28:11.976 --> 03:28:13.500
MARISHA: Like let him do this?
LIAM: --if he thinks it's good idea.

5094
03:28:13.500 --> 03:28:16.410
Yes, you tell him it's a good idea and I send him away.

5095
03:28:16.410 --> 03:28:17.430
MARISHA: That's a good idea.

5096
03:28:17.430 --> 03:28:18.670
MATT: The Laughing Hand is currently

5097
03:28:18.670 --> 03:28:20.490
out of earshot of you, by the way.

5098
03:28:20.490 --> 03:28:22.223
He has been told to rush off

5099
03:28:22.223 --> 03:28:24.006
and is now giving a wide perimeter.

5100
03:28:24.006 --> 03:28:26.200
LAURA: I think we've got an hour to get in and out, okay?

5101
03:28:26.200 --> 03:28:27.033
SAM: Let's go.

5102
03:28:27.033 --> 03:28:29.620
LAURA: The Laughing Hand's not coming back in an hour.

5103
03:28:29.620 --> 03:28:31.388
SAM: It's dealt with already.

5104
03:28:32.320 --> 03:28:34.580
Are we going to sit back and diddle around with

5105
03:28:34.580 --> 03:28:35.638
the Laughing Hand or are we going to

5106
03:28:35.638 --> 03:28:37.963
go catch up to our quarry?

5107
03:28:37.963 --> 03:28:39.880
TALIESIN: We're running while we're talking.

5108
03:28:39.880 --> 03:28:40.713
LAURA: Yeah, we're running.

5109
03:28:40.713 --> 03:28:43.950
SAM: Every step we take, with every word we speak,

5110
03:28:43.950 --> 03:28:46.850
we are getting 50, 100 feet away from him.

5111
03:28:46.850 --> 03:28:47.990
So you want to turn around and go back?

5112
03:28:47.990 --> 03:28:50.081
LAURA: No, no, no, we're going.
TALIESIN: He's with us.

5113
03:28:50.081 --> 03:28:50.914
LAURA: No, he's not.

5114
03:28:50.914 --> 03:28:51.747
TALIESIN: He's keeping a perimeter.

5115
03:28:51.747 --> 03:28:53.090
SAM: He is walking all the way around.

5116
03:28:53.090 --> 03:28:54.398
MATT: He is doing-- basically you guys

5117
03:28:54.398 --> 03:28:55.406
are moving this direction.

5118
03:28:55.406 --> 03:28:56.960
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: He is running--

5119
03:28:56.960 --> 03:28:59.230
he is doing an opposite,

5120
03:28:59.230 --> 03:29:01.984
opposite of what you guys did, the Laughing Hand.

5121
03:29:01.984 --> 03:29:03.655
LAURA: Well, let's do it.
MARISHA: No, we're good, we're good.

5122
03:29:03.655 --> 03:29:04.547
LAURA: It doesn't matter.
MARISHA: Let's just go.

5123
03:29:04.547 --> 03:29:05.778
LAURA: It's not like Obann wouldn't have

5124
03:29:05.778 --> 03:29:07.019
been able to go find him and get him again.

5125
03:29:07.019 --> 03:29:08.730
MARISHA: Sorry, I didn't mean to stab you in the throat.

5126
03:29:08.730 --> 03:29:11.190
He's got one Banishment. Let's use it wisely.

5127
03:29:11.190 --> 03:29:13.430
TRAVIS: Yeah, plus if he resists it or whatever,

5128
03:29:13.430 --> 03:29:15.920
coming from me is one thing but if we resist it,

5129
03:29:15.920 --> 03:29:17.580
then it breaks and then--
LAURA: It's an attack.

5130
03:29:17.580 --> 03:29:19.391
It counts as an attack if he resists it.

5131
03:29:19.391 --> 03:29:20.740
SAM: He's out of the picture.

5132
03:29:20.740 --> 03:29:23.380
MATT: You guys are continuing forward, fast-paced.

5133
03:29:23.380 --> 03:29:26.740
I need Jester and Beau to go ahead and make

5134
03:29:26.740 --> 03:29:29.910
a survival check to try and guide the rest

5135
03:29:29.910 --> 03:29:32.820
of the party through this forest at a decent pace.

5136
03:29:32.820 --> 03:29:34.280
MARISHA: Let me not be shitty.

5137
03:29:34.280 --> 03:29:36.449
LIAM: Pretty good, pretty good.
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay.

5138
03:29:36.449 --> 03:29:37.470
LAURA: 25.

5139
03:29:37.470 --> 03:29:39.590
TALIESIN: I would've tapped you, too.
MARISHA: 18.

5140
03:29:39.590 --> 03:29:40.800
Oh, are you tapping me?
TALIESIN: I would've tapped you.

5141
03:29:40.800 --> 03:29:42.130
LAURA: Well if you're close enough.

5142
03:29:42.130 --> 03:29:44.040
TALIESIN: Well, I'm keeping up.

5143
03:29:44.040 --> 03:29:44.900
MATT: You couldn't keep up with Beau.

5144
03:29:44.900 --> 03:29:46.280
TALIESIN: Okay, nevermind, she's too fast.

5145
03:29:46.280 --> 03:29:47.113
MATT: She's too far ahead of you.

5146
03:29:47.113 --> 03:29:47.946
MARISHA: 18.
LAURA: 25.

5147
03:29:47.946 --> 03:29:48.990
MATT: 18, 25, okay.

5148
03:29:49.830 --> 03:29:52.230
You guys are keeping point on this, helping guide

5149
03:29:52.230 --> 03:29:54.500
through the paths of least resistance.

5150
03:29:54.500 --> 03:29:56.670
At times, you manage to gain some speed.

5151
03:29:56.670 --> 03:29:57.970
At times, it still pulls you back.

5152
03:29:57.970 --> 03:30:01.630
But you're able to keep a fairly decent travel forward.

5153
03:30:01.630 --> 03:30:03.110
Thankfully, the jungle here is very dense

5154
03:30:03.110 --> 03:30:05.760
and the canopy as well. There are many vines

5155
03:30:05.760 --> 03:30:07.640
and many tangled brush, which means it's difficult

5156
03:30:07.640 --> 03:30:10.820
for a flying creature to continue to move through.

5157
03:30:10.820 --> 03:30:11.653
LAURA: Oh, right.

5158
03:30:11.653 --> 03:30:12.910
MATT: Unless it breaks through the canopy,

5159
03:30:12.910 --> 03:30:15.070
like you guys did before, you don't know.

5160
03:30:15.070 --> 03:30:18.620
But you're moving as fast as you can in that direction.

5161
03:30:18.620 --> 03:30:21.420
You continue on for 20 minutes.

5162
03:30:22.930 --> 03:30:24.140
30 minutes.

5163
03:30:24.140 --> 03:30:27.910
Perception checks for two of you toward the front.

5164
03:30:27.910 --> 03:30:32.910
The front would be probably, actually Nott and Beauregard.

5165
03:30:32.980 --> 03:30:34.780
You guys are the ones furthest out.

5166
03:30:34.780 --> 03:30:36.790
MARISHA: Your perception sucks, doesn't it?

5167
03:30:36.790 --> 03:30:38.340
LAURA: No, only if she's--
SAM: Yeah.

5168
03:30:38.340 --> 03:30:39.173
LAURA: Yes.

5169
03:30:40.220 --> 03:30:41.410
SAM: I'll help you.

5170
03:30:41.410 --> 03:30:43.400
MATT: I would say that your invisibility has now worn off.

5171
03:30:43.400 --> 03:30:44.233
SAM: Sure.

5172
03:30:44.233 --> 03:30:46.954
MARISHA: I'll take your help.

5173
03:30:46.954 --> 03:30:49.290
I think mine is better than yours.

5174
03:30:50.794 --> 03:30:51.950
MATT: Showed up for a second and went away.

5175
03:30:51.950 --> 03:30:53.564
TALIESIN: Yeah.

5176
03:30:53.564 --> 03:30:54.736
LAURA: Good, good, good.

5177
03:30:54.736 --> 03:30:57.340
TALIESIN: That was a vain-- sorry, I'm--

5178
03:30:57.340 --> 03:30:59.240
SAM: What'd you get, Marish?

5179
03:30:59.240 --> 03:31:00.310
MARISHA: 14.

5180
03:31:00.310 --> 03:31:01.143
SAM: Yeah.

5181
03:31:01.143 --> 03:31:02.860
MARISHA: Still not rolling great.
SAM: I helped her.

5182
03:31:02.860 --> 03:31:04.627
MATT: Oh, so 14.

5183
03:31:04.627 --> 03:31:05.752
Okay.

5184
03:31:05.752 --> 03:31:08.647
MARISHA: No!
(players screaming)

5185
03:31:08.647 --> 03:31:10.669
MATT: See if I can get some--
LAURA: Fucking trees down.

5186
03:31:10.669 --> 03:31:12.097
MATT: I don't have anywhere to put this for the time being.

5187
03:31:12.097 --> 03:31:13.819
LIAM: The Laughing Hand gone.

5188
03:31:13.819 --> 03:31:14.727
MATT: That's fine there. That'll be fine.

5189
03:31:14.727 --> 03:31:15.935
LIAM: Part of me doesn't want to combat,

5190
03:31:15.935 --> 03:31:18.034
but part of me really wants to combat.

5191
03:31:18.034 --> 03:31:19.750
LAURA: I can't do anything.

5192
03:31:19.750 --> 03:31:20.583
TALIESIN: I know.
LIAM: I know, but I still want--

5193
03:31:20.583 --> 03:31:23.260
MATT: Continuing on forward, you don't see anything.

5194
03:31:23.260 --> 03:31:25.120
You push on, 40 minutes.

5195
03:31:27.840 --> 03:31:28.673
50 minutes.

5196
03:31:28.673 --> 03:31:30.780
LAURA: Listening for anything as well.

5197
03:31:30.780 --> 03:31:33.430
MATT: At about the 45 minute mark or so,

5198
03:31:33.430 --> 03:31:35.688
you begin to see the trees change.

5199
03:31:36.629 --> 03:31:39.000
You begin to see the atmosphere

5200
03:31:39.000 --> 03:31:42.225
of the Lotusden shift around you.

5201
03:31:43.730 --> 03:31:46.380
You can see bits of rotted vegetation

5202
03:31:46.380 --> 03:31:50.430
along the floor that contains trapped gases

5203
03:31:50.430 --> 03:31:52.970
to where when you step on some of these patches,

5204
03:31:52.970 --> 03:31:54.950
it releases this hissing sound

5205
03:31:54.950 --> 03:31:58.400
that sounds like a death moan or slow whispers

5206
03:31:58.400 --> 03:32:00.800
and for a first moment, it freaks you out.

5207
03:32:00.800 --> 03:32:02.810
You continue to move forward and these little patches

5208
03:32:02.810 --> 03:32:06.340
of like weird trapped gas are amongst a bunch of broken

5209
03:32:06.340 --> 03:32:10.910
ground and rocks, like a shattered quarry and the trees,

5210
03:32:10.910 --> 03:32:15.180
the leaves rapidly begin to just vanish.

5211
03:32:15.180 --> 03:32:17.870
You see just barren, petrified trees.

5212
03:32:17.870 --> 03:32:20.830
Their extended branches extremely crooked

5213
03:32:20.830 --> 03:32:23.650
and building and knotting around each other

5214
03:32:23.650 --> 03:32:25.960
to form like a series

5215
03:32:25.960 --> 03:32:28.800
of chained together trees that are holding

5216
03:32:28.800 --> 03:32:31.280
this dense canopy where the branches grow

5217
03:32:31.280 --> 03:32:32.560
smaller branches that grow smaller branches

5218
03:32:32.560 --> 03:32:35.070
that grow smaller-- you see this capillary type system

5219
03:32:35.070 --> 03:32:38.150
where the dark canopy where leaves normally cover

5220
03:32:38.150 --> 03:32:42.130
is replaced with just a bramble mess of overgrown branches.

5221
03:32:43.050 --> 03:32:47.650
MARISHA: Can I get a beat as we're running on the scent

5222
03:32:47.650 --> 03:32:50.830
of the gas that we're stepping on. Is it sulfurous?

5223
03:32:50.830 --> 03:32:53.330
MATT: Make a nature check.
MARISHA: Is it noxious? Okay.

5224
03:32:56.630 --> 03:32:58.130
Nature?
MATT: Mm hmm.

5225
03:32:58.130 --> 03:32:59.350
MARISHA: 14.

5226
03:32:59.350 --> 03:33:01.760
MATT: 14, it doesn't appear to be sulfurous.

5227
03:33:01.760 --> 03:33:06.193
It seems to be some sort of a rotting vegetation byproduct.

5228
03:33:06.193 --> 03:33:07.190
MARISHA: Okay.

5229
03:33:07.190 --> 03:33:09.390
MATT: Whatever's corrupting or causing

5230
03:33:09.390 --> 03:33:11.480
this section of the forest to be the way it is,

5231
03:33:11.480 --> 03:33:13.980
it's part of the decaying process that happens

5232
03:33:13.980 --> 03:33:16.440
beneath the surface, probably in the roots

5233
03:33:16.440 --> 03:33:19.030
or something below the actual trees themselves and it's

5234
03:33:19.030 --> 03:33:22.077
causing this to rise up and in some places become trapped.

5235
03:33:23.410 --> 03:33:25.362
So pushing on forward,

5236
03:33:25.362 --> 03:33:27.860
trying the best you can to push through the terrain.

5237
03:33:27.860 --> 03:33:32.030
Thankfully, the heavy bits of completely grown over

5238
03:33:32.030 --> 03:33:35.350
and moss covered rock begin to subside,

5239
03:33:35.350 --> 03:33:39.840
as now it's just slippery shale and cracked ground.

5240
03:33:40.700 --> 03:33:43.290
The bits of moisture and marsh that occasionally

5241
03:33:43.290 --> 03:33:46.550
greeted you through this forest is nowhere to be seen

5242
03:33:46.550 --> 03:33:51.550
and you are just rushing rapidly through this darkened,

5243
03:33:51.580 --> 03:33:55.280
lightless, for the humans as well,

5244
03:33:55.280 --> 03:33:57.243
and firbolg

5245
03:33:58.920 --> 03:34:01.087
lightless region of dead trees.

5246
03:34:02.920 --> 03:34:04.300
MARISHA: Hey, Caduceus.

5247
03:34:04.300 --> 03:34:05.133
TALIESIN: Yeah?

5248
03:34:05.133 --> 03:34:07.440
MARISHA: Does any of this reminds you of the Blooming Grove

5249
03:34:07.440 --> 03:34:11.840
and the rot that you've discovered on the grave?

5250
03:34:11.840 --> 03:34:14.764
TALIESIN: We didn't have rot. We had an overtaking.

5251
03:34:14.764 --> 03:34:17.115
It's different. I assume it's different.
MATT: It is.

5252
03:34:17.115 --> 03:34:21.380
This is just, this looks to be a dead portion of the forest.

5253
03:34:21.380 --> 03:34:23.170
The Savalirwood is a heavy corruption.

5254
03:34:23.170 --> 03:34:26.320
It's still lush, but the leaves have turned purple-gray

5255
03:34:26.320 --> 03:34:29.250
and it is a very vibrant, angry growth of something

5256
03:34:29.250 --> 03:34:31.790
that is sinister in the nature of the actual forest.

5257
03:34:31.790 --> 03:34:33.850
This is just a dead section.
TALIESIN: I also can't see that well.

5258
03:34:33.850 --> 03:34:34.720
I'm traveling by moonlight.

5259
03:34:34.720 --> 03:34:36.450
LIAM: We're still in that quick move here, too, right?

5260
03:34:36.450 --> 03:34:37.300
MATT: Yeah, you're still running.

5261
03:34:37.300 --> 03:34:38.133
You're still making your way

5262
03:34:38.133 --> 03:34:39.900
through best you can in that direction.

5263
03:34:40.781 --> 03:34:43.250
TALIESIN: Not touching any trees.
LAURA: Yeah, nothing.

5264
03:34:43.250 --> 03:34:45.170
MATT: Yeah, you hit about the 50,

5265
03:34:45.170 --> 03:34:46.780
a little past the 50 minute mark.

5266
03:34:46.780 --> 03:34:50.570
Make a perception check once again, Nott and Beauregard.

5267
03:34:50.570 --> 03:34:52.550
SAM: I'll help you again.

5268
03:34:53.437 --> 03:34:55.078
MARISHA: Okay.

5269
03:34:55.078 --> 03:34:57.240
You have a negative to your perception, right?
LAURA: Am I close to them yet?

5270
03:34:57.240 --> 03:34:58.650
Can I Guide her?
MARISHA: No?

5271
03:34:59.537 --> 03:35:00.470
LAURA: Would I be able to guide her?

5272
03:35:00.470 --> 03:35:03.010
Am I close at all or are they super far ahead?

5273
03:35:03.010 --> 03:35:04.370
MATT: They're too far ahead of you.

5274
03:35:04.370 --> 03:35:06.200
MARISHA: Great, 15.

5275
03:35:06.200 --> 03:35:07.190
MATT: 15.

5276
03:35:07.190 --> 03:35:08.470
SAM: I helped her.
MARISHA: He helped me.

5277
03:35:08.470 --> 03:35:09.540
MATT: Oh, gotcha.

5278
03:35:09.540 --> 03:35:13.200
As you come apart ahead of the group,

5279
03:35:13.200 --> 03:35:15.450
you push through a couple of additional trees

5280
03:35:15.450 --> 03:35:19.000
and look over the edge and you can see

5281
03:35:19.000 --> 03:35:22.380
one tree that looms taller than the rest.

5282
03:35:22.380 --> 03:35:24.980
It's not massive at its base, it's thin,

5283
03:35:24.980 --> 03:35:27.310
but it's twisted and spiraled upward

5284
03:35:27.310 --> 03:35:29.440
and it looks like a series of dead vines

5285
03:35:29.440 --> 03:35:32.900
have choked it and then just died on its body

5286
03:35:32.900 --> 03:35:35.820
to the point where it looks like a mass of

5287
03:35:35.820 --> 03:35:38.180
like striations and rope that gather

5288
03:35:38.180 --> 03:35:41.180
into this thick, tall, leafless tree.

5289
03:35:41.180 --> 03:35:43.990
All of its hundreds and hundreds of branches

5290
03:35:43.990 --> 03:35:48.098
all seem to reach out like smaller arms and fingers.

5291
03:35:49.166 --> 03:35:51.785
It is notably

5292
03:35:51.785 --> 03:35:55.030
a paler, starch blanch white color against

5293
03:35:55.030 --> 03:35:58.780
the other trees that are just dead and a little

5294
03:35:58.780 --> 03:36:02.890
more gray without the coloration of the rest of the forest.

5295
03:36:02.890 --> 03:36:06.160
The air is noticeably colder as you get

5296
03:36:06.160 --> 03:36:08.220
closer towards it and as you glance past,

5297
03:36:08.220 --> 03:36:10.530
you see the tree and at the base of it,

5298
03:36:10.530 --> 03:36:14.150
you can see both Yasha and Obann.

5299
03:36:14.150 --> 03:36:16.430
Yasha jogging, just catching up

5300
03:36:16.430 --> 03:36:19.770
and Obann currently inspecting the base of the tree.

5301
03:36:21.103 --> 03:36:22.550
LIAM: How far back are we from them?

5302
03:36:22.550 --> 03:36:25.540
MATT: I will give you a little preview.

5303
03:36:25.540 --> 03:36:28.930
MARISHA: He hasn't gotten it. He hasn't gotten it yet.

5304
03:36:28.930 --> 03:36:33.390
SAM: Guys, can I just tell you about dwarvenforge.com?

5305
03:36:33.390 --> 03:36:35.430
LAURA: So in 10 minutes, it's going to break.

5306
03:36:35.430 --> 03:36:40.293
SAM: It's a fantastic company that makes a fine product

5307
03:36:41.230 --> 03:36:44.972
and if you don't go to their fucking website, I'll kill you.

5308
03:36:46.297 --> 03:36:48.110
TALIESIN: Wow.
SAM: It's getting late, guys.

5309
03:36:48.110 --> 03:36:49.080
TALIESIN: Wow.

5310
03:36:49.080 --> 03:36:50.410
LIAM: Tensions are ramping up.

5311
03:36:50.410 --> 03:36:52.640
MARISHA: We're under a lot of stress.

5312
03:36:52.640 --> 03:36:54.560
You can do a lot in 10 minutes, though.

5313
03:36:54.560 --> 03:36:56.343
LAURA: You can do a lot in 10 minutes.

5314
03:36:56.343 --> 03:36:59.670
MATT: This is approximately the location of the tree.

5315
03:36:59.670 --> 03:37:01.812
And where you see Obann

5316
03:37:03.824 --> 03:37:06.168
and--
SAM: What is that stuff on there?

5317
03:37:06.168 --> 03:37:07.690
Is that sesame seeds?

5318
03:37:07.690 --> 03:37:09.890
MATT: This is just the broken shale.

5319
03:37:09.890 --> 03:37:11.465
SAM: Sure.
MATT: On this there.

5320
03:37:11.465 --> 03:37:12.564
MARISHA: Anthrax.

5321
03:37:12.564 --> 03:37:15.605
SAM: How did you do that?
LIAM: That's asbestos.

5322
03:37:15.605 --> 03:37:19.705
MATT: I'm enjoying the experimentation
with various other textured

5323
03:37:19.705 --> 03:37:21.250
terrain things added on top of maps.
TRAVIS: It's cool.

5324
03:37:21.250 --> 03:37:23.188
LIAM: Asbestos for the rest of us.
TALIESIN: Layering is great.

5325
03:37:23.188 --> 03:37:25.140
MARISHA: He took shavings from our old apartment.

5326
03:37:25.140 --> 03:37:27.202
MATT: There you go.
(laughter)

5327
03:37:27.202 --> 03:37:28.460
TALIESIN: Wow, that's a throwback.

5328
03:37:28.460 --> 03:37:29.780
LAURA: Yes.

5329
03:37:29.780 --> 03:37:32.405
LIAM: It's just standard.
Five years' worth of dandruff.

5330
03:37:32.405 --> 03:37:33.750
MATT: And Nott.

5331
03:37:33.750 --> 03:37:36.920
The rest of you are traveling--

5332
03:37:36.920 --> 03:37:39.470
MARISHA: When you're on a budget.
MATT: --about 40 feet behind them.

5333
03:37:39.470 --> 03:37:40.766
LIAM: When you're on a budget.

5334
03:37:40.766 --> 03:37:42.041
MATT: But actually you guys would probably be

5335
03:37:42.041 --> 03:37:43.555
on this side because you're not too far from each other.

5336
03:37:43.555 --> 03:37:45.480
But that's the view you have currently.

5337
03:37:47.510 --> 03:37:50.840
MARISHA: I, of course, immediately relay this
to the rest of the team.

5338
03:37:50.840 --> 03:37:52.960
MATT: So you wait for them to catch up?

5339
03:37:52.960 --> 03:37:56.450
MARISHA: Yeah, I stop, see it, look at Nott and be like--

5340
03:37:56.450 --> 03:37:59.030
LAURA: Can you go invisible?
SAM: Of course I can.

5341
03:37:59.030 --> 03:38:00.000
MARISHA: What the fuck?

5342
03:38:00.000 --> 03:38:01.460
SAM: Are we going to stick to the plan?

5343
03:38:01.460 --> 03:38:02.830
Me invisible, go swipe the thing?

5344
03:38:02.830 --> 03:38:05.527
MARISHA: I think so.
LAURA: Can you do it still?

5345
03:38:05.527 --> 03:38:07.110
Not anymore.

5346
03:38:07.110 --> 03:38:09.280
MATT: Obann flies up about 10 or so feet.

5347
03:38:09.280 --> 03:38:11.280
SAM: Oh, Jesus.
MATT: And is now inspecting

5348
03:38:11.280 --> 03:38:13.000
the base of the tree.

5349
03:38:13.000 --> 03:38:15.930
MARISHA: We got to do this now before he
figures this shit out.

5350
03:38:15.930 --> 03:38:18.190
SAM: I'm going to go invisible now.
LAURA: And be a distraction.

5351
03:38:18.190 --> 03:38:19.520
MATT: Okay, so you go invisible.

5352
03:38:19.520 --> 03:38:21.803
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

5353
03:38:23.910 --> 03:38:25.570
MATT: There you go.

5354
03:38:25.570 --> 03:38:29.223
LAURA: Can I run up behind that one?

5355
03:38:29.223 --> 03:38:31.440
MATT: Okay, so you guys have now caught up to Beauregard.

5356
03:38:31.440 --> 03:38:33.910
So you're all essentially back in this space here.

5357
03:38:34.843 --> 03:38:37.050
MARISHA: He's looking at the fucking tree.

5358
03:38:37.050 --> 03:38:39.920
MATT: Okay, and so Jester's going to move up behind here.

5359
03:38:39.920 --> 03:38:42.953
SAM: In the absence of a plan,
I'm going to start moving up the side.

5360
03:38:42.953 --> 03:38:44.000
MATT: Okay.

5361
03:38:44.000 --> 03:38:46.500
MARISHA: And I'm going to--
MATT: 35.

5362
03:38:46.500 --> 03:38:49.230
MARISHA: --mirror Nott's movement,

5363
03:38:49.230 --> 03:38:51.120
knowing that she's going invisible

5364
03:38:51.120 --> 03:38:52.737
and flank on the other side.

5365
03:38:54.206 --> 03:38:55.530
MATT: Okay, can you make a stealth check?

5366
03:38:55.530 --> 03:38:56.363
MARISHA: Yep.

5367
03:38:57.390 --> 03:38:59.430
TALIESIN: I'll tap you before you leave.

5368
03:38:59.430 --> 03:39:00.490
MARISHA: Thank you.

5369
03:39:00.490 --> 03:39:03.010
LAURA: Oh yeah, I'll touch you as well,

5370
03:39:03.010 --> 03:39:04.690
for Blessing of the Trickster.

5371
03:39:04.690 --> 03:39:06.098
MARISHA: Which gives me advantage?

5372
03:39:06.098 --> 03:39:07.631
LAURA: Advantage on stealth checks.
MARISHA: Thank you.

5373
03:39:07.631 --> 03:39:09.145
SAM: Double tap?
MARISHA: Hell yeah.

5374
03:39:09.145 --> 03:39:10.453
MATT: I'll allow that.

5375
03:39:10.453 --> 03:39:13.562
LIAM: Caleb silently holds up
a piece of chalk and looks at Fjord.

5376
03:39:15.960 --> 03:39:17.197
TRAVIS: What, what?

5377
03:39:18.120 --> 03:39:19.203
LAURA: Prep it.

5378
03:39:21.350 --> 03:39:23.670
LIAM: I'll start drawing.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

5379
03:39:23.670 --> 03:39:24.510
MATT: What are you drawing?

5380
03:39:24.510 --> 03:39:25.750
LIAM: A Teleportation circle.
MATT: Okay.

5381
03:39:25.750 --> 03:39:27.640
Where are you going to start drawing it?

5382
03:39:27.640 --> 03:39:32.240
LIAM: I will back up 10 feet behind that tree.

5383
03:39:32.240 --> 03:39:33.460
MATT: Here?
LIAM: That Caduceus--

5384
03:39:33.460 --> 03:39:35.160
I'll go behind Caduceus back five

5385
03:39:35.160 --> 03:39:38.020
more feet and start to draw on the ground.

5386
03:39:38.020 --> 03:39:39.820
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: Yeah. I will use the chalk.

5387
03:39:39.820 --> 03:39:41.187
MATT: You're beginning the build the circle.

5388
03:39:41.187 --> 03:39:43.900
LIAM: This might not go off but I'm spending the components.

5389
03:39:43.900 --> 03:39:45.460
MATT: Correct, correct.

5390
03:39:45.460 --> 03:39:46.810
Okay.

5391
03:39:46.810 --> 03:39:48.010
Caduceus, Fjord?

5392
03:39:48.010 --> 03:39:51.510
MARISHA: 29 for stealth for Beau, flank to mirror--

5393
03:39:51.510 --> 03:39:53.490
MATT: To head over this way.
MARISHA: Mirror Nott, yeah.

5394
03:39:53.490 --> 03:39:54.978
MATT: You got it.
TALIESIN: Eyes of the Grave.

5395
03:39:54.978 --> 03:39:56.259
LIAM: Holy shit.

5396
03:39:56.259 --> 03:39:58.410
LAURA: And I'm going to prep Invoke Duplicity.

5397
03:39:58.410 --> 03:39:59.560
MATT: Okay.

5398
03:39:59.560 --> 03:40:01.603
SAM: I'm 25 stealth.

5399
03:40:01.603 --> 03:40:02.822
MATT: You got it.

5400
03:40:02.822 --> 03:40:03.790
LIAM: Holy shit.

5401
03:40:03.790 --> 03:40:07.100
LAURA: I'm going to prep her to appear behind this tree,

5402
03:40:07.100 --> 03:40:09.660
to step out from behind that as soon as I want her to.

5403
03:40:09.660 --> 03:40:10.590
MATT: You got it.
LAURA: Not yet.

5404
03:40:10.590 --> 03:40:12.380
MATT: All right, Fjord, Caduceus?

5405
03:40:12.380 --> 03:40:15.900
TRAVIS: I'm going to use another Divine Sense

5406
03:40:15.900 --> 03:40:20.900
just to focus in on my sense of where they are.

5407
03:40:21.290 --> 03:40:23.293
MATT: The range of that is 60 feet?
TRAVIS: It is 60.

5408
03:40:23.293 --> 03:40:24.240
MATT: You'll be too far to sense anything.

5409
03:40:24.240 --> 03:40:26.590
TRAVIS: Fair enough, I won't--
would I know that I'm not close enough?

5410
03:40:26.590 --> 03:40:28.220
MATT: You would know that.
TRAVIS: You know what, it's new.

5411
03:40:28.220 --> 03:40:29.361
MATT: You're starting to figure it out.
You're figuring it out.

5412
03:40:29.361 --> 03:40:30.194
TRAVIS: Okay.

5413
03:40:31.030 --> 03:40:33.400
I will also move to the--

5414
03:40:34.490 --> 03:40:35.323
LIAM: Where's Nott?

5415
03:40:35.323 --> 03:40:37.150
TRAVIS: I will move to the right.
SAM: You don't know.

5416
03:40:37.150 --> 03:40:40.080
TRAVIS: Closer to the direction Nott went
and hide behind that tree.

5417
03:40:41.250 --> 03:40:44.100
MARISHA: Fucking metagamer.
MATT: 30. Make a stealth check.

5418
03:40:44.100 --> 03:40:49.100
LIAM: DM, I will also roll Frumpkin out
to chase Jester's feet.

5419
03:40:49.320 --> 03:40:51.290
TRAVIS: Did you give me Blessing of the Trickster?

5420
03:40:51.290 --> 03:40:52.707
It was for her.
LAURA: It was for her.

5421
03:40:52.707 --> 03:40:54.545
TRAVIS: Okay, that's fine.

5422
03:40:56.820 --> 03:40:59.370
MATT: This poor Frumpkin mini, the legs are so fragile.

5423
03:40:59.370 --> 03:41:01.350
LIAM: What is going on with my cats?

5424
03:41:01.350 --> 03:41:03.180
MATT: I don't know, man.

5425
03:41:03.180 --> 03:41:04.640
LIAM: Goddamn it.
TRAVIS: I know.

5426
03:41:04.640 --> 03:41:06.130
We should've ordered them in bulk.

5427
03:41:06.130 --> 03:41:07.600
LAURA: Maybe if the mini was better,

5428
03:41:07.600 --> 03:41:09.890
Frumpkin would do a better job of doing anything.

5429
03:41:09.890 --> 03:41:12.765
MARISHA: Yeah Matt, do you want to use this one?
LIAM: Stop it, Laura Bailey.

5430
03:41:12.765 --> 03:41:15.430
MATT: I'll use your pupper. That's fine.

5431
03:41:15.430 --> 03:41:17.450
MARISHA: My puppers.
LIAM: Fucking dogs.

5432
03:41:17.450 --> 03:41:19.410
Are you kidding me?
TRAVIS: 17.

5433
03:41:19.410 --> 03:41:20.962
MATT: 17?
SAM: We love dogs, everyone.

5434
03:41:20.962 --> 03:41:22.390
MATT: All righty.
LIAM: Don't.

5435
03:41:22.390 --> 03:41:24.580
LAURA: Are we all rolling stealth?
LIAM: You do! I love cats.

5436
03:41:24.580 --> 03:41:27.334
MATT: For those who are moving to not be seen, yes.

5437
03:41:27.334 --> 03:41:29.650
So you have to roll a stealth check as well.

5438
03:41:29.650 --> 03:41:31.150
All right, got it.

5439
03:41:31.150 --> 03:41:32.458
SAM: Good.

5440
03:41:33.644 --> 03:41:35.510
MATT: The cat's moving with Jester, you said?

5441
03:41:35.510 --> 03:41:36.760
LIAM: Yes.
LAURA: 24.

5442
03:41:36.760 --> 03:41:38.100
MATT: 24, got it.

5443
03:41:38.100 --> 03:41:39.290
Caduceus, what are you doing?

5444
03:41:39.290 --> 03:41:41.990
TALIESIN: I'm staying behind the tree and I'm going

5445
03:41:41.990 --> 03:41:46.020
to be ready to try and hit people with heal or otherwise,

5446
03:41:46.020 --> 03:41:47.690
if things go shitty.
MATT: You got it.

5447
03:41:47.690 --> 03:41:50.190
LIAM: Very smart.
MATT: You got it, all right.

5448
03:41:50.190 --> 03:41:53.474
At this point, Obann is now up the side of the tree.

5449
03:41:55.590 --> 03:41:57.730
It's a little far to see the details,

5450
03:41:57.730 --> 03:42:01.727
but it looks like he finds a portion of the tree

5451
03:42:01.727 --> 03:42:04.310
and begins to like fit his hand into it.

5452
03:42:04.310 --> 03:42:06.850
MARISHA: He's fucking found it.
LAURA: He's found it already.

5453
03:42:06.850 --> 03:42:08.910
LIAM: He's finger-fucking the tree.

5454
03:42:08.910 --> 03:42:11.060
SAM: It's in the tree?
LAURA: Yes, it's in the tree.

5455
03:42:11.060 --> 03:42:14.780
SAM: I thought it was like down in a dungeon, I don't know.

5456
03:42:14.780 --> 03:42:16.910
MARISHA: We had no confirmation of that.

5457
03:42:16.910 --> 03:42:18.568
LAURA: We got to get to him fast.

5458
03:42:19.570 --> 03:42:21.828
MATT: Yasha is going to stop and turn

5459
03:42:21.828 --> 03:42:23.290
and just keep an eye behind him now

5460
03:42:23.290 --> 03:42:24.960
and is like looking--
SAM: Smart Yasha.

5461
03:42:24.960 --> 03:42:26.500
MATT: Outward, doesn't see anybody right now

5462
03:42:26.500 --> 03:42:28.070
because you're all hidden behind things.

5463
03:42:28.070 --> 03:42:29.920
LIAM: Damn it.
MATT: But is keeping a watch.

5464
03:42:30.877 --> 03:42:33.220
LIAM: This is a shit show.
SAM: I can get up there.

5465
03:42:33.220 --> 03:42:34.360
MARISHA: Stick with the plan until--

5466
03:42:34.360 --> 03:42:36.370
MATT: Everyone gets another round of actions.

5467
03:42:36.370 --> 03:42:37.680
SAM: Closer.

5468
03:42:37.680 --> 03:42:39.000
MATT: Okay.
SAM: As fast as I can--

5469
03:42:39.000 --> 03:42:40.550
MATT: Stealth check.
SAM: By being stealthed.

5470
03:42:40.550 --> 03:42:42.460
I have to check again?

5471
03:42:42.460 --> 03:42:44.310
MATT: You do, yes.

5472
03:42:44.310 --> 03:42:45.968
SAM: A ton, 32.
LIAM: This is not enough time to

5473
03:42:45.968 --> 03:42:47.500
draw a Teleportation Circle!

5474
03:42:47.500 --> 03:42:48.333
MATT: 32.

5475
03:42:48.333 --> 03:42:49.995
LIAM: You're drawing it, right?

5476
03:42:49.995 --> 03:42:51.560
LIAM: I am.
MATT: So mark your second round.

5477
03:42:51.560 --> 03:42:53.089
10 rounds.

5478
03:42:53.089 --> 03:42:55.681
LIAM: Frumpkin is sticking with Jester.
MATT: You got it.

5479
03:42:57.594 --> 03:42:58.427
LIAM: That's it.

5480
03:42:58.427 --> 03:43:00.969
LAURA: (humming nervous "um"s)

5481
03:43:00.969 --> 03:43:03.740
TRAVIS: I'm just curious because we all
get one more round, right?

5482
03:43:03.740 --> 03:43:07.820
After this round, it's go time, right?

5483
03:43:07.820 --> 03:43:09.140
MARISHA: And then so Nott--
TRAVIS: It's not?

5484
03:43:09.140 --> 03:43:11.417
SAM: I don't know what go time means.
We didn't stop to make a plan.

5485
03:43:11.417 --> 03:43:13.895
MATT: You guys didn't stop and make a point,
so you're all doing your own thing.

5486
03:43:13.895 --> 03:43:15.561
MARISHA: You're still going with the plan--
MATT: There's no communication here.

5487
03:43:15.561 --> 03:43:17.600
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, I know.

5488
03:43:17.600 --> 03:43:19.730
TALIESIN: I'm going to be making a hold sign at you anyway.

5489
03:43:19.730 --> 03:43:21.260
LAURA: I'm invoking Duplicity behind the thing.

5490
03:43:21.260 --> 03:43:23.360
MATT: But you already did that last round.

5491
03:43:23.360 --> 03:43:24.580
LAURA: Okay, so she's there.

5492
03:43:24.580 --> 03:43:25.413
MATT: She's there.
LAURA: Okay.

5493
03:43:25.413 --> 03:43:27.590
SAM: The plan that we had before was someone was going to

5494
03:43:27.590 --> 03:43:29.385
make a distraction while I go swipe this thing.

5495
03:43:29.385 --> 03:43:30.986
TRAVIS: I can't do that anymore.

5496
03:43:30.986 --> 03:43:32.820
SAM: As far as I know, that's what I'm doing.

5497
03:43:32.820 --> 03:43:33.653
TRAVIS: I'm holding, I saw Caduceus do a holding sign.

5498
03:43:33.653 --> 03:43:35.310
LIAM: We've never had a fight that has lasted 10 rounds.

5499
03:43:35.310 --> 03:43:37.195
LAURA: Should I, I mean--
TALIESIN: She's got this.

5500
03:43:37.195 --> 03:43:39.440
LIAM: No Teleportation circle happening.

5501
03:43:39.440 --> 03:43:40.750
TALIESIN: We have to wait a few rounds

5502
03:43:40.750 --> 03:43:42.180
if the Teleportation Circle is going to happen.

5503
03:43:42.180 --> 03:43:43.760
SAM: Maybe Obann will cast--

5504
03:43:43.760 --> 03:43:45.733
LIAM: One minute.
MARISHA: It's one minute.

5505
03:43:45.733 --> 03:43:46.566
SAM: --Slow on everyone.

5506
03:43:46.566 --> 03:43:49.140
LIAM: We have never had a fight, ever,
that has lasted that long.

5507
03:43:49.140 --> 03:43:50.950
LAURA: Should I bring my duplicate out and just go for it?

5508
03:43:50.950 --> 03:43:52.620
MARISHA: But it's already been one round,
we're on round two.

5509
03:43:52.620 --> 03:43:55.787
TALIESIN: We need eight more rounds.
MARISHA: We need eight more rounds.

5510
03:43:55.787 --> 03:43:58.342
SAM: You know where Beau is.

5511
03:43:58.342 --> 03:44:00.470
Beau, are you getting closer or are you just--

5512
03:44:00.470 --> 03:44:03.080
MARISHA: I am mirroring your movements to--

5513
03:44:03.080 --> 03:44:04.790
SAM: But you don't know where I am.

5514
03:44:04.790 --> 03:44:07.620
MARISHA: Well I know she's invisible
and I know she's creeping up.

5515
03:44:07.620 --> 03:44:09.520
TRAVIS: She can see 'dem leaves moving.

5516
03:44:09.520 --> 03:44:11.484
MARISHA: I'm going to keep creeping up knowing

5517
03:44:11.484 --> 03:44:14.090
that that was the plan that we made before.

5518
03:44:14.090 --> 03:44:15.171
MATT: That's fine.

5519
03:44:15.171 --> 03:44:17.196
LAURA: I can send my duplicate out
and cast Spiritual Weapon--

5520
03:44:17.196 --> 03:44:18.029
MARISHA: That's all I got.

5521
03:44:18.029 --> 03:44:20.450
LAURA: --from her and try to bash Obann
over the head and get him.

5522
03:44:20.450 --> 03:44:23.160
TALIESIN: I am trying to signal everyone to wait

5523
03:44:23.160 --> 03:44:25.350
because I see where the Teleportation circle's at.

5524
03:44:25.350 --> 03:44:27.166
MARISHA: I should've refreshed deodorant.

5525
03:44:27.166 --> 03:44:29.580
TALIESIN: Can he hold the Circle, by the way?

5526
03:44:29.580 --> 03:44:32.380
MATT: When he completes casting the spell?

5527
03:44:32.380 --> 03:44:34.670
TALIESIN: Yeah, but like he can wait for the final--

5528
03:44:34.670 --> 03:44:36.738
TRAVIS: He can draw it and then cast--

5529
03:44:36.738 --> 03:44:38.790
MATT: I'd say-- I'll allow it.
LIAM: Hold the last line,

5530
03:44:38.790 --> 03:44:40.498
I've said that many times.
MATT: Yeah, I'll allow it.

5531
03:44:40.498 --> 03:44:42.393
LIAM: I'm doubtful that we will

5532
03:44:42.393 --> 03:44:45.019
have the time to draw the lines, though.

5533
03:44:46.100 --> 03:44:48.070
I'm getting ready to drop this fucking

5534
03:44:48.070 --> 03:44:49.620
Teleportation circle and join the fray.

5535
03:44:49.620 --> 03:44:51.215
But right now I'm drawing.

5536
03:44:51.215 --> 03:44:54.240
TRAVIS: You're the bail out, so.
MARISHA: Art faster.

5537
03:44:54.240 --> 03:44:57.480
MATT: So you're moving around this way?

5538
03:44:57.480 --> 03:45:00.200
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm going to keep-- yep, go wide.

5539
03:45:00.200 --> 03:45:01.330
MATT: Make another stealth check.

5540
03:45:01.330 --> 03:45:02.610
SAM: You better stealth good.

5541
03:45:02.610 --> 03:45:03.764
MATT: With advantage because

5542
03:45:03.764 --> 03:45:05.968
you have Blessing of the Trickster still.

5543
03:45:08.731 --> 03:45:10.700
SAM: You stealth good, Marisha Ray.

5544
03:45:10.700 --> 03:45:12.110
TALIESIN: We should have waited.

5545
03:45:12.110 --> 03:45:13.608
LIAM: Don't do it wrong, do it right.

5546
03:45:13.608 --> 03:45:15.434
MARISHA: I've been rolling so bad for a month.

5547
03:45:15.434 --> 03:45:17.168
LIAM: Now do it right.

5548
03:45:17.168 --> 03:45:18.318
Is it advantage or disadvantage?

5549
03:45:18.318 --> 03:45:19.890
MARISHA: Advantage.
LIAM: Pretty good.

5550
03:45:19.890 --> 03:45:22.200
MARISHA: Yeah, 21.
SAM: Okay, okay.

5551
03:45:22.200 --> 03:45:23.840
MARISHA: 21.
SAM: Plus 20.

5552
03:45:23.840 --> 03:45:25.605
MATT: Not noticed yet.

5553
03:45:25.605 --> 03:45:27.180
Is Blessing of the Trickster an hour long?

5554
03:45:27.180 --> 03:45:28.720
LAURA: Yeah, for an hour. It uses it for an hour.

5555
03:45:28.720 --> 03:45:30.170
MATT: Is it an action?
LAURA: Yeah.

5556
03:45:30.170 --> 03:45:32.781
MATT: All right, so you wouldn't
have been able to do both last round.

5557
03:45:32.781 --> 03:45:34.620
So now you create your Invoke Duplicity.

5558
03:45:34.620 --> 03:45:36.048
LAURA: That's fine.
MATT: Got it.

5559
03:45:36.048 --> 03:45:38.068
All right, Fjord, Caduceus, anything?

5560
03:45:38.068 --> 03:45:39.901
TALIESIN: I'm trying to do the...

5561
03:45:41.605 --> 03:45:44.450
TRAVIS: I'm just watching Caduceus, I guess. I'm holding.

5562
03:45:44.450 --> 03:45:47.050
MATT: You're holding.
LIAM: Holy shit.

5563
03:45:47.050 --> 03:45:49.820
MATT: You now see Obann is now up

5564
03:45:49.820 --> 03:45:53.680
to the shoulder in this tree and is like-- (groaning)

5565
03:45:53.680 --> 03:45:57.512
You can hear him loosely in pain

5566
03:45:58.910 --> 03:46:03.275
and then you watch the tree (crackling) shudder

5567
03:46:05.420 --> 03:46:08.960
and suddenly he gets pushed out of the tree for a second.

5568
03:46:08.960 --> 03:46:12.650
His arm, this weird mist drifting off of it

5569
03:46:12.650 --> 03:46:15.183
as he floats back about five feet or so.

5570
03:46:16.241 --> 03:46:17.620
SAM: Oh shit.
MATT: The tree now,

5571
03:46:17.620 --> 03:46:21.360
its roots don't pull out of the ground aggressively.

5572
03:46:21.360 --> 03:46:25.450
You watch them just drift up like they're nothing

5573
03:46:25.450 --> 03:46:27.480
and the tree comes to life.

5574
03:46:27.480 --> 03:46:30.100
Its many branches become many arms.

5575
03:46:30.100 --> 03:46:33.420
You see where that knothole

5576
03:46:33.420 --> 03:46:37.690
where Obann put his arm remains, but you can see

5577
03:46:37.690 --> 03:46:40.380
there's these ghostly teeth on the inside.

5578
03:46:40.380 --> 03:46:44.478
No eyes, but the Wraithroot is now animated.

5579
03:46:45.468 --> 03:46:47.720
SAM: The tree is the guy.
MARISHA: Is the assassin?

5580
03:46:47.720 --> 03:46:49.895
Or is this--
LAURA: Whoa!

5581
03:46:49.895 --> 03:46:52.230
TRAVIS: Oh shit!
LAURA: Shit.

5582
03:46:52.230 --> 03:46:53.620
SAM: He put the heart in.

5583
03:46:53.620 --> 03:46:55.895
MARISHA: The heart is in the tree, the curse.

5584
03:46:55.895 --> 03:46:58.920
TALIESIN: He tried to get it out and it fought it.
LAURA: Now he has to fight the tree.

5585
03:46:58.920 --> 03:47:00.130
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MARISHA: Which could be great.

5586
03:47:00.130 --> 03:47:01.802
SAM: The bark that bites, okay, got it.

5587
03:47:01.802 --> 03:47:03.270
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

5588
03:47:03.270 --> 03:47:04.900
Be cool, be cool.
TRAVIS: The bark that bites.

5589
03:47:04.900 --> 03:47:07.062
TALIESIN: We can let this play out for awhile.

5590
03:47:07.062 --> 03:47:09.135
MATT: Obann's go ahead and fly up.
LAURA: Maybe.

5591
03:47:09.135 --> 03:47:10.798
TALIESIN: I'm happy to let this--
MATT: Reactively even higher.

5592
03:47:10.798 --> 03:47:12.558
LIAM: Is he holding anything visibly?

5593
03:47:12.558 --> 03:47:14.141
MATT: You don't know, you weren't looking.

5594
03:47:14.141 --> 03:47:16.070
LIAM: Okay. That's right, I'm drawing.

5595
03:47:16.070 --> 03:47:17.668
SAM: Can I see anything?
LAURA: Can we see?

5596
03:47:17.668 --> 03:47:19.980
MATT: If you want to take your turn
to try and take a look at it.

5597
03:47:19.980 --> 03:47:24.980
So Yasha turns around and draws Skingorger.

5598
03:47:25.062 --> 03:47:26.440
(swooshing)

5599
03:47:26.440 --> 03:47:28.267
Now looks up at the tree.

5600
03:47:29.362 --> 03:47:31.560
So now we're going to go ahead and roll initiative

5601
03:47:31.560 --> 03:47:34.590
because there is a combat happening

5602
03:47:34.590 --> 03:47:37.392
even if you are not directly in it.
TRAVIS: (yelling)

5603
03:47:37.392 --> 03:47:38.526
Okay.

5604
03:47:40.202 --> 03:47:43.015
TALIESIN: Let's let them do this.
MARISHA: What dice, what dice?

5605
03:47:43.015 --> 03:47:44.328
TALIESIN: Ew, gross.

5606
03:47:44.328 --> 03:47:47.260
TRAVIS: Let them fight.

5607
03:47:47.260 --> 03:47:48.568
TALIESIN: So gross.

5608
03:47:48.568 --> 03:47:49.793
SAM: Oh no, really?

5609
03:47:49.793 --> 03:47:52.350
TALIESIN: Yes, I mean, I have a couple

5610
03:47:52.350 --> 03:47:54.220
interesting things if things go south.

5611
03:47:54.220 --> 03:47:57.764
TRAVIS: You always do, buddy.
SAM: Things will go south.

5612
03:47:57.764 --> 03:47:59.485
TALIESIN: I mean like maybe this'll

5613
03:47:59.485 --> 03:48:02.420
weaken him up a bit, I don't know.

5614
03:48:02.420 --> 03:48:03.790
MATT: 25 to 20.

5615
03:48:03.790 --> 03:48:05.123
SAM: 24.

5616
03:48:06.264 --> 03:48:09.072
LIAM: Is this the beginning of round three
for me on my drawing?

5617
03:48:09.072 --> 03:48:10.472
MATT: This would be, yes.
LIAM: Okay.

5618
03:48:10.472 --> 03:48:13.007
All right, 25 to 20-- just Nott?

5619
03:48:13.007 --> 03:48:14.880
All right, 20 to 15.

5620
03:48:14.880 --> 03:48:16.338
MARISHA: 19.
LIAM: 19.

5621
03:48:18.480 --> 03:48:20.510
MARISHA: Na na na na 19.

5622
03:48:20.510 --> 03:48:22.627
LAURA: 18 for me.
LIAM: Oh shit, half-elves again.

5623
03:48:22.627 --> 03:48:25.622
MATT: Beau, and Caleb is next.
LIAM: 19.

5624
03:48:27.090 --> 03:48:29.383
For my drawing.
MARISHA: Your drar-ing.

5625
03:48:29.383 --> 03:48:31.054
MATT: All right, and Jester?
LAURA: Was 18.

5626
03:48:31.054 --> 03:48:32.865
SAM: ♪ And I like to do drawings ♪

5627
03:48:32.865 --> 03:48:35.406
LIAM: (English accent) My name is Caleb
and I like to do drawings.

5628
03:48:36.248 --> 03:48:39.306
SAM: (exaggerated German accent) Vell hello,
my name is Caleb.

5629
03:48:39.306 --> 03:48:40.823
MATT: 15 to 10.

5630
03:48:40.823 --> 03:48:42.360
TRAVIS: 13.

5631
03:48:42.360 --> 03:48:43.193
MATT: All right.

5632
03:48:44.470 --> 03:48:46.344
TALIESIN: I know, I am not okay.

5633
03:48:46.344 --> 03:48:48.250
LIAM: All the things I could do, but I'm drawing.

5634
03:48:48.250 --> 03:48:50.320
MATT: 10 to five?

5635
03:48:50.320 --> 03:48:53.942
SAM: We're not taking another break.
TRAVIS: What is it?

5636
03:48:53.942 --> 03:48:56.053
A three, Caduceus rolled a three.

5637
03:48:56.053 --> 03:48:57.403
MATT: Fjord, what'd you roll?

5638
03:48:57.403 --> 03:48:59.180
TRAVIS: I rolled a 13.

5639
03:48:59.180 --> 03:49:00.590
MATT: 13.
LAURA: You rolled a three?

5640
03:49:00.590 --> 03:49:02.400
TALIESIN: No, I rolled a two and then I add one.

5641
03:49:02.400 --> 03:49:05.417
LAURA: Oh god.
TALIESIN: And that makes three.

5642
03:49:05.417 --> 03:49:07.854
I mean to be fair, a cleric with a low initiative is great.

5643
03:49:07.854 --> 03:49:09.860
MATT: Nott, you're up first.

5644
03:49:09.860 --> 03:49:12.297
SAM: I will move closer

5645
03:49:13.600 --> 03:49:15.500
and use my action.

5646
03:49:16.490 --> 03:49:18.465
Maybe...

5647
03:49:18.465 --> 03:49:19.762
MATT: Where do you want to go?
MARISHA: Come on, come on.

5648
03:49:19.762 --> 03:49:23.265
SAM: Maybe-- yeah, I guess that's fine,
I'm invisible, that's fine.

5649
03:49:23.265 --> 03:49:25.170
I'm invisible, it's fine.

5650
03:49:25.170 --> 03:49:27.812
TRAVIS: We're not going to let them know
that we're here, though, right?

5651
03:49:27.812 --> 03:49:28.788
MARISHA: No.

5652
03:49:28.788 --> 03:49:31.530
MATT: Because you guys are in a misted forest--
TALIESIN: Bless you, yes.

5653
03:49:31.530 --> 03:49:32.730
MATT: And I have--

5654
03:49:32.730 --> 03:49:34.930
TALIESIN: I'm so happy that these get used.

5655
03:49:34.930 --> 03:49:37.200
TRAVIS: Teleportation circle is not ready.

5656
03:49:37.200 --> 03:49:40.260
MARISHA: No, I know but time is of the essence.

5657
03:49:40.260 --> 03:49:41.990
We got to get this fucking skull.

5658
03:49:41.990 --> 03:49:43.850
SAM: I'll move up.
LIAM: Seven more rounds.

5659
03:49:43.850 --> 03:49:46.040
SAM: And I will use my--
LAURA: Seven more rounds.

5660
03:49:46.040 --> 03:49:48.583
SAM: I will use my action to perceive

5661
03:49:49.647 --> 03:49:53.730
to see if I can perceive the bag in Obann's--

5662
03:49:53.730 --> 03:49:55.597
MATT: Okay, roll a perception check.

5663
03:49:57.130 --> 03:49:59.250
SAM: 19.
MATT: 19.

5664
03:49:59.250 --> 03:50:03.170
It is still attached to the side of his belt.

5665
03:50:03.170 --> 03:50:05.950
It's not loosely attached, it's affixed

5666
03:50:05.950 --> 03:50:07.300
pretty well because it's an important thing.

5667
03:50:07.300 --> 03:50:08.960
SAM: Double locked or anything or just like--?

5668
03:50:08.960 --> 03:50:12.752
MATT: No, it's just not tied
to it loosely jumping around there.

5669
03:50:12.752 --> 03:50:14.920
It's strapped with leather straps.

5670
03:50:14.920 --> 03:50:17.945
SAM: And he's 30 feet above me,
20 feet above me, 80 feet above?

5671
03:50:17.945 --> 03:50:20.295
MATT: He's right now about 50 feet above you.

5672
03:50:20.295 --> 03:50:22.920
LIAM: Sleight of hand that motherfucker.

5673
03:50:22.920 --> 03:50:25.070
SAM: I can't do it yet.
TALIESIN: Wait 'til he's on the ground.

5674
03:50:25.070 --> 03:50:26.340
TRAVIS: You fail, he knows.

5675
03:50:26.340 --> 03:50:27.918
MARISHA: Okay, okay.
LIAM: That's right, that's right.

5676
03:50:27.918 --> 03:50:29.168
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MARISHA: Okay.

5677
03:50:29.168 --> 03:50:30.850
LIAM: But he is fighting a tree.

5678
03:50:30.850 --> 03:50:33.990
MATT: All right, so Nott, is that your turn?

5679
03:50:33.990 --> 03:50:36.373
SAM: That is my turn.
MATT: Beau, Caleb, you're up next.

5680
03:50:36.373 --> 03:50:37.970
MARISHA: What are you doing?
LIAM: I'm drawing.

5681
03:50:37.970 --> 03:50:39.060
MATT: Third round.
LIAM: I'm drawing.

5682
03:50:39.060 --> 03:50:41.040
MATT: Beauregard?
MARISHA: I am going to--

5683
03:50:41.040 --> 03:50:43.207
TALIESIN: 18 seconds of drawing.

5684
03:50:45.050 --> 03:50:46.320
Or fourth round?

5685
03:50:46.320 --> 03:50:48.125
MARISHA: I'm going to hold my action.
LIAM: It's the third.

5686
03:50:48.125 --> 03:50:49.484
TALIESIN: Fuck me.
MARISHA: Can I hold my turn?

5687
03:50:49.484 --> 03:50:51.886
LIAM: This is so boring for combat.
MATT: You can hold your action.

5688
03:50:51.886 --> 03:50:54.145
MARISHA: I can hold my action but I can't hold my move.

5689
03:50:54.145 --> 03:50:55.245
MATT: Correct.

5690
03:50:57.090 --> 03:50:59.800
TRAVIS: Can people feel when you put a Hex on them?

5691
03:50:59.800 --> 03:51:00.633
MATT: Yeah.

5692
03:51:02.210 --> 03:51:03.413
Yeah, I'd say so.

5693
03:51:04.580 --> 03:51:06.560
TALIESIN: Like most spells, there's
not a lot of spells that happen

5694
03:51:06.560 --> 03:51:08.980
and they don't even know it.
MARISHA: I want to move just around

5695
03:51:08.980 --> 03:51:11.480
a little bit, just here, here.

5696
03:51:12.350 --> 03:51:14.360
Crouch, hide.

5697
03:51:14.360 --> 03:51:15.974
Hold my action.

5698
03:51:15.974 --> 03:51:17.265
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: Waiting for Nott.

5699
03:51:17.265 --> 03:51:18.098
MATT: So you're still stealthed.

5700
03:51:18.098 --> 03:51:19.780
MARISHA: I'm still stealthed.
MATT: Hiding low, okay.

5701
03:51:19.780 --> 03:51:22.190
Holding your action 'til what?

5702
03:51:23.140 --> 03:51:25.872
MARISHA: Until either shit hits the fan

5703
03:51:27.962 --> 03:51:30.310
or shit hits the fan.

5704
03:51:30.310 --> 03:51:33.510
MATT: Okay, you got it.

5705
03:51:33.510 --> 03:51:37.610
That brings us to Jester and Yasha.

5706
03:51:37.610 --> 03:51:40.770
Yasha is going to go ahead and rush up, Skingorger out.

5707
03:51:41.690 --> 03:51:44.970
She is going to spend her action to (swooshing),

5708
03:51:44.970 --> 03:51:48.700
her wings emerge, the giant necrotic,

5709
03:51:48.700 --> 03:51:52.350
fleshless, fallen aasimar wings emerge.

5710
03:51:52.350 --> 03:51:56.530
She roars angrily and goes into a rage and that's her turn.

5711
03:51:56.530 --> 03:51:58.262
LIAM: Yes!
MATT: Jester, what are you doing?

5712
03:51:58.262 --> 03:52:02.213
LIAM: I mean, she must be stopped.
(laughter)

5713
03:52:02.213 --> 03:52:04.220
LAURA: I'm hanging out.

5714
03:52:04.220 --> 03:52:05.300
MATT: Okay, you're just waiting?

5715
03:52:05.300 --> 03:52:07.130
LAURA: Yeah, I'm waiting until--
MATT: All right.

5716
03:52:07.130 --> 03:52:08.300
SAM: Can you buff anybody?

5717
03:52:08.300 --> 03:52:10.820
LAURA: I can't really, no because I have my Duplicity up.

5718
03:52:10.820 --> 03:52:13.318
MATT: The Wraithroot Tree.
LIAM: Oh boy.

5719
03:52:13.318 --> 03:52:16.180
MATT: Now its roots kind of-- it's weird.

5720
03:52:16.180 --> 03:52:17.790
The roots almost go slack

5721
03:52:17.790 --> 03:52:21.087
like they're weird wooden tentacles

5722
03:52:21.087 --> 03:52:24.147
and drifts through Yasha.

5723
03:52:24.147 --> 03:52:25.100
SAM: What?

5724
03:52:25.100 --> 03:52:27.970
MATT: It becomes incorporeal for a moment.

5725
03:52:27.970 --> 03:52:29.050
TRAVIS: Oh boy.

5726
03:52:29.921 --> 03:52:32.707
MATT: Not knocking that over.
TRAVIS: Respect your fellow tree.

5727
03:52:32.707 --> 03:52:35.180
MATT: Drifts around--
TRAVIS: We have to back the fuck off.

5728
03:52:35.180 --> 03:52:37.918
MATT: --this direction and is going to go ahead

5729
03:52:37.918 --> 03:52:41.947
and make attacks on Yasha, who is raging.

5730
03:52:44.150 --> 03:52:45.500
Yeah, that definitely hits.

5731
03:52:46.770 --> 03:52:47.603
Both hit.

5732
03:52:48.450 --> 03:52:49.770
Yasha takes...

5733
03:52:53.856 --> 03:52:55.930
MARISHA: Oh, the Hades tree.

5734
03:52:58.605 --> 03:53:02.188
MATT: 30 points of bludgeoning damage
reduced to 15 because she is raging.

5735
03:53:04.192 --> 03:53:05.266
So she...

5736
03:53:05.266 --> 03:53:06.910
SAM: That's a big mother fucking tree.

5737
03:53:06.910 --> 03:53:09.161
MATT: Yep, I'm keeping track of her hit points.

5738
03:53:09.161 --> 03:53:12.860
All right, that finishes the Wraithroot Tree.

5739
03:53:12.860 --> 03:53:14.555
That brings it to Fjord.

5740
03:53:14.555 --> 03:53:15.763
TRAVIS: I do nothing.

5741
03:53:15.763 --> 03:53:17.750
MATT: You do nothing, you wait.

5742
03:53:17.750 --> 03:53:18.858
Obann's turn.

5743
03:53:19.770 --> 03:53:21.380
Obann is going to drift,

5744
03:53:22.390 --> 03:53:24.060
take that, whatever that was that fell.

5745
03:53:24.060 --> 03:53:25.070
I'll deal with you later.
SAM: Hey, isn't your--

5746
03:53:25.070 --> 03:53:27.040
TALIESIN: Just some lollipops.

5747
03:53:27.040 --> 03:53:29.720
SAM: Isn't your demon ogre still alive?

5748
03:53:29.720 --> 03:53:31.169
TRAVIS: He's way the fuck back there.
LAURA: Way far away.

5749
03:53:31.169 --> 03:53:32.787
SAM: Oh, he didn't follow us?

5750
03:53:32.787 --> 03:53:35.650
MATT: Obann's going to drift down and attempt to

5751
03:53:36.900 --> 03:53:40.019
place its arm into the maw once more.

5752
03:53:40.019 --> 03:53:42.480
LIAM: He's still trying to get it.
MARISHA: He's trying to get the heart.

5753
03:53:42.480 --> 03:53:44.421
LIAM: He's still trying to get at its nads.

5754
03:53:44.421 --> 03:53:46.692
MATT: He puts the arm in a second time

5755
03:53:46.692 --> 03:53:49.140
and it's now going to be--
LIAM: He's copping a feel.

5756
03:53:49.140 --> 03:53:51.400
MATT: He has to make a Constitution saving throw.

5757
03:53:51.400 --> 03:53:52.233
He succeeds.

5758
03:53:52.233 --> 03:53:54.870
TRAVIS: Take your time, Matt, take your time.

5759
03:53:54.870 --> 03:53:55.703
Get it right.

5760
03:53:57.265 --> 03:53:58.807
Kill that fucking demon.

5761
03:54:00.400 --> 03:54:03.070
With that pissed off ghost tree.

5762
03:54:03.070 --> 03:54:04.550
MATT: He winces in pain once more

5763
03:54:04.550 --> 03:54:07.290
and he's going to attempt to contest its strength.

5764
03:54:07.290 --> 03:54:08.440
I'm sorry, it's a DC...

5765
03:54:09.934 --> 03:54:12.706
LIAM: Come on, tree.
MATT: Nevermind. It's a DC check.

5766
03:54:12.706 --> 03:54:14.760
TRAVIS: Come on, Groot.
LIAM: Come on, Giving Tree.

5767
03:54:18.867 --> 03:54:21.190
MARISHA: You fucker.
MATT: His hand emerges

5768
03:54:21.190 --> 03:54:24.730
clutching some sort of a dull, glowing--

5769
03:54:24.730 --> 03:54:26.600
LAURA: Seriously, that fucking fast?

5770
03:54:26.600 --> 03:54:27.900
MATT: Stone.
SAM: That was easy.

5771
03:54:28.760 --> 03:54:30.490
LAURA: Good for him.

5772
03:54:30.490 --> 03:54:33.200
MATT: The tree's still standing.
SAM: Okay, good.

5773
03:54:34.100 --> 03:54:36.750
MATT: But that's his action is to pull it from the mouth.

5774
03:54:36.750 --> 03:54:41.160
You can see outside of the mouth,
all this mist (hissing).

5775
03:54:41.160 --> 03:54:43.520
MARISHA: You held your action, right?
SAM: No, I didn't hold my action.

5776
03:54:43.520 --> 03:54:47.720
MATT: And he's going to go--
he has enough movement to get 20

5777
03:54:47.720 --> 03:54:50.420
more feet up, so that'll put him at 30 feet off the ground.

5778
03:54:50.420 --> 03:54:53.736
SAM: When are we going to do it, then?
LAURA: He's only 30 feet off the ground.

5779
03:54:53.736 --> 03:54:55.320
MARISHA: Piece of shit.

5780
03:54:55.320 --> 03:54:56.850
LAURA: What's your range?

5781
03:54:56.850 --> 03:54:59.125
MATT: All right. He's now holding--
this hand's backing away

5782
03:54:59.125 --> 03:55:03.420
and he goes (cackling) and he's looking down at Yasha.

5783
03:55:03.420 --> 03:55:05.890
"We did it. We did it!"

5784
03:55:05.890 --> 03:55:08.685
Looks up to the sky, "We did it."

5785
03:55:09.880 --> 03:55:11.513
That ends his turn.

5786
03:55:11.513 --> 03:55:13.376
SAM: ♪ Looks like we made it ♪

5787
03:55:13.376 --> 03:55:14.934
TRAVIS: That was far faster--

5788
03:55:14.934 --> 03:55:17.280
TALIESIN: The tree doesn't get
to reaction attack against him, or--?

5789
03:55:17.280 --> 03:55:18.630
LIAM: Immediately.

5790
03:55:18.630 --> 03:55:20.553
MARISHA: So that was-- you have six rounds left, six rounds?

5791
03:55:20.553 --> 03:55:22.800
LIAM: Six rounds, seven, six?

5792
03:55:22.800 --> 03:55:25.386
I've done three, seven.

5793
03:55:25.386 --> 03:55:27.941
TALIESIN: How many feet away is all this happening at?

5794
03:55:27.941 --> 03:55:32.941
MATT: Looking at this, probably about
70 to 90 feet from you.

5795
03:55:33.470 --> 03:55:36.780
TALIESIN: Fuck, I'm still seeing him drawing and I'm holding.

5796
03:55:36.780 --> 03:55:38.020
MATT: Okay.

5797
03:55:38.020 --> 03:55:41.780
MATT: Actually just for fun, I was going to do--

5798
03:55:41.780 --> 03:55:44.210
I tried to do this earlier, I'm just going to do--

5799
03:55:44.210 --> 03:55:47.500
try and Detect Undead just to see if--

5800
03:55:47.500 --> 03:55:49.370
I was going to do an Eyes of the Grave.

5801
03:55:49.370 --> 03:55:50.870
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Actually, yeah.

5802
03:55:50.870 --> 03:55:54.350
MATT: A very, very strong undead presence from that tree.

5803
03:55:54.350 --> 03:55:55.650
TALIESIN: Gotcha.

5804
03:55:56.630 --> 03:56:00.520
MATT: And from the object-- what's the range on that?

5805
03:56:00.520 --> 03:56:01.353
TALIESIN: 60 feet.

5806
03:56:01.353 --> 03:56:03.470
MATT: You probably have to get closer actually to do that.

5807
03:56:03.470 --> 03:56:06.761
TALIESIN: But nothing, nothing other than the tree?
MATT: No.

5808
03:56:06.761 --> 03:56:09.980
TALIESIN: I can tell the tree's undead.
I'm just seeing if there's anything else around.

5809
03:56:09.980 --> 03:56:11.970
MATT: That's fine. Nott, you're up.

5810
03:56:11.970 --> 03:56:15.070
LAURA: Just like try to untie it.
Just try to untie the bag from the back.

5811
03:56:15.070 --> 03:56:17.090
SAM: I'm going to move right under him.

5812
03:56:17.090 --> 03:56:18.630
MATT: Okay.

5813
03:56:18.630 --> 03:56:20.583
MARISHA: Yes, come on.

5814
03:56:20.583 --> 03:56:23.190
SAM: I mean I got to do this, right?
They're going to bamf outta here.

5815
03:56:23.190 --> 03:56:26.115
MARISHA: This is it, this is it.
LIAM: You've got to do it.

5816
03:56:28.510 --> 03:56:29.520
SAM: Yeah.

5817
03:56:29.520 --> 03:56:32.950
Okay, I will cast Mage Hand.

5818
03:56:32.950 --> 03:56:35.010
MATT: So your invisibility drops.

5819
03:56:35.010 --> 03:56:37.090
SAM: Sure, yeah, that's fine.

5820
03:56:37.090 --> 03:56:39.060
MATT: Nott appears.

5821
03:56:39.060 --> 03:56:41.251
LAURA: Hopefully Obann is looking up

5822
03:56:41.251 --> 03:56:42.990
at the sky at this moment.

5823
03:56:42.990 --> 03:56:44.848
In his joy.

5824
03:56:44.848 --> 03:56:47.106
MARISHA: "We did it."
SAM: He's holding something with one hand.

5825
03:56:47.106 --> 03:56:49.600
MATT: He is.
SAM: Does he have a weapon?

5826
03:56:49.600 --> 03:56:51.440
LAURA: Of course he has a fucking weapon.

5827
03:56:51.440 --> 03:56:53.490
MATT: Right now--
SAM: Does he have a weapon?

5828
03:56:53.490 --> 03:56:55.760
MATT: No, he does have a...

5829
03:56:57.406 --> 03:56:59.479
LIAM: Saints Row dildo bat.

5830
03:56:59.479 --> 03:57:00.312
MATT: Yeah.

5831
03:57:00.312 --> 03:57:02.320
He does have a longsword that he has sheathed.

5832
03:57:02.320 --> 03:57:04.150
SAM: Okay, so he's got one hand free.

5833
03:57:04.150 --> 03:57:05.490
MATT: Yeah, he wasn't even trying to fight it.

5834
03:57:05.490 --> 03:57:07.450
He was just going directly for--

5835
03:57:07.450 --> 03:57:10.033
SAM: And then bonus action with Mage Hand,

5836
03:57:10.033 --> 03:57:13.680
I will try to untie that bag.

5837
03:57:13.680 --> 03:57:15.860
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make a--

5838
03:57:15.860 --> 03:57:18.050
LIAM: Tickle that bag, goblin.
SAM: I don't know what I'm--

5839
03:57:18.050 --> 03:57:19.332
MATT: It's a thieves' tools check.

5840
03:57:19.332 --> 03:57:22.782
So add your dexterity modifier plus your proficiency bonus.

5841
03:57:26.276 --> 03:57:27.820
LIAM: Fuck.
SAM: Terrible.

5842
03:57:27.820 --> 03:57:28.753
LIAM: Fuck.

5843
03:57:31.300 --> 03:57:32.440
SAM: 12.

5844
03:57:32.440 --> 03:57:33.870
MATT: 12.

5845
03:57:33.870 --> 03:57:36.490
The Mage Hand reaches up.

5846
03:57:36.490 --> 03:57:37.323
TALIESIN: Fuck.

5847
03:57:37.323 --> 03:57:40.540
MATT: And it's not moving the leather straps.

5848
03:57:40.540 --> 03:57:42.410
You don't have a good angle on it looking from underneath

5849
03:57:42.410 --> 03:57:43.620
and you're not quite sure how to mess with it

5850
03:57:43.620 --> 03:57:45.320
from the side and it's not doing anything.

5851
03:57:45.320 --> 03:57:48.120
Obann is like looking up, kind of--

5852
03:57:48.120 --> 03:57:50.470
glances down and looks right towards you.

5853
03:57:50.470 --> 03:57:51.561
SAM: Hello.

5854
03:57:52.420 --> 03:57:54.670
MATT: This look of absolute surprise hits his face.

5855
03:57:54.670 --> 03:57:57.587
LIAM: Oh god, we're blown.
MARISHA: Does it feel like shit's hitting the fan?

5856
03:57:57.587 --> 03:57:59.760
SAM: Oh, for sure, yeah.
MATT: Certainly feels that way.

5857
03:57:59.760 --> 03:58:02.280
MARISHA: When I was holding my turn for.

5858
03:58:02.280 --> 03:58:05.788
MATT: Yes, so, what's your action?

5859
03:58:07.025 --> 03:58:09.122
MARISHA: I can't really do much. I'm pretty far.

5860
03:58:09.122 --> 03:58:12.088
(laughter)

5861
03:58:12.088 --> 03:58:14.180
TRAVIS: A monk all the way over here.

5862
03:58:14.180 --> 03:58:16.058
MARISHA: A monk in the BFE.

5863
03:58:16.058 --> 03:58:17.600
LIAM: Did you use all your movement speed?

5864
03:58:17.600 --> 03:58:20.443
TALIESIN: You can't spend movement on your action roll.
MARISHA: Just action.

5865
03:58:20.443 --> 03:58:22.158
MATT: If you wanted to dash to get closer

5866
03:58:22.158 --> 03:58:23.863
as your held action, that would be your thing.

5867
03:58:23.863 --> 03:58:25.245
MARISHA: I'll do that!

5868
03:58:25.245 --> 03:58:27.590
SAM: Oh my god.
MATT: If that's-- all right,

5869
03:58:27.590 --> 03:58:29.480
going forward, you have to declare what your

5870
03:58:29.480 --> 03:58:31.390
action is as you're holding it, just as a heads up.

5871
03:58:31.390 --> 03:58:33.080
MARISHA: I do declare.
MATT: All right.

5872
03:58:33.080 --> 03:58:35.396
LIAM: Oh my god, man.
MATT: I'll allow it. Five, 10, 15, 20.

5873
03:58:35.396 --> 03:58:38.250
25, 30, 35, 40.
LIAM: Tree might be our friend

5874
03:58:39.096 --> 03:58:40.996
at this moment.
MATT: Your movement's 45?

5875
03:58:43.410 --> 03:58:45.917
MARISHA: 50 now.
MATT: Is it?

5876
03:58:45.917 --> 03:58:47.058
MARISHA: Oh shit, oh shit.

5877
03:58:47.058 --> 03:58:49.100
MATT: You can get all the way up to Yasha if you want to.

5878
03:58:49.100 --> 03:58:50.290
MARISHA: I can move all the way up to Yasha?

5879
03:58:50.290 --> 03:58:53.080
MATT: If you want to, or you can move--
MARISHA: I move all the way up to Yasha.

5880
03:58:53.080 --> 03:58:54.573
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: And I go,

5881
03:58:55.440 --> 03:58:57.090
Hi.

5882
03:58:57.090 --> 03:58:59.660
MATT: She looks over at Nott, the wings unfurl.

5883
03:58:59.660 --> 03:59:02.740
The wind, the mist gathered around her.

5884
03:59:02.740 --> 03:59:04.700
MARISHA: Sorry.
MATT: Her hair blowing slightly.

5885
03:59:04.700 --> 03:59:06.050
MARISHA: Sorry.

5886
03:59:07.300 --> 03:59:09.120
Sorry.

5887
03:59:09.120 --> 03:59:11.000
Sorry.

5888
03:59:11.000 --> 03:59:11.833
MATT: All righty.

5889
03:59:12.750 --> 03:59:14.640
LIAM: So Obann, Yasha, tree.

5890
03:59:14.640 --> 03:59:16.562
TRAVIS: (laughing defeatedly)

5891
03:59:16.562 --> 03:59:19.040
MARISHA: I'm sorry! It's what Beau would do.

5892
03:59:19.040 --> 03:59:20.520
MATT: Well Beau and Caleb, you're up.

5893
03:59:20.520 --> 03:59:22.157
Caleb, you mark off a fourth round.

5894
03:59:22.157 --> 03:59:26.332
LIAM: Fuck, no, was that your held action
or what are you doing now?

5895
03:59:26.332 --> 03:59:28.360
MARISHA: I was holding my action

5896
03:59:28.360 --> 03:59:30.370
until the shit hit the fan.

5897
03:59:30.370 --> 03:59:31.540
It was Nott's turn,

5898
03:59:31.540 --> 03:59:34.280
the shit hit the fan, and now it's our turn.

5899
03:59:34.280 --> 03:59:36.100
It's back at the top of the round.

5900
03:59:36.100 --> 03:59:39.560
LIAM: You go first.
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

5901
03:59:39.560 --> 03:59:41.518
LIAM: Come on, Empire twin. Do it.

5902
03:59:43.226 --> 03:59:46.300
MARISHA: I am hoping...

5903
03:59:46.300 --> 03:59:49.380
I am hoping that maybe if I go toe to toe

5904
03:59:49.380 --> 03:59:51.690
with Yasha and square off against Yasha,

5905
03:59:51.690 --> 03:59:54.913
maybe Obann will see that as a distraction

5906
03:59:56.402 --> 04:00:00.490
and Nott can continue her plan and I'm going to

5907
04:00:01.480 --> 04:00:04.570
square off and pop-pop against Yasha.

5908
04:00:04.570 --> 04:00:05.786
MATT: Go for it.

5909
04:00:09.460 --> 04:00:12.320
TRAVIS: Roll confidently in your actions, go.

5910
04:00:12.320 --> 04:00:13.310
LAURA: Do it, go.

5911
04:00:13.310 --> 04:00:16.966
MARISHA: Two attacks, I'm rolling both attacks.
TRAVIS: There's no playbook here.

5912
04:00:16.966 --> 04:00:19.732
MARISHA: No playbook, no playbook.

5913
04:00:19.732 --> 04:00:21.920
Okay.

5914
04:00:21.920 --> 04:00:23.920
First roll sucks. It's a 12.

5915
04:00:23.920 --> 04:00:26.160
MATT: Misses.
MARISHA: Second roll is better, 25.

5916
04:00:26.160 --> 04:00:29.070
MATT: That hits, the second attack does damage.

5917
04:00:29.070 --> 04:00:30.997
MARISHA: I'm going to use my staffy-poo.

5918
04:00:32.110 --> 04:00:34.422
Okay, 11 damage.
MATT: 11 damage.

5919
04:00:34.422 --> 04:00:36.400
TRAVIS: Why can't I get just one more spell?

5920
04:00:36.400 --> 04:00:38.140
MATT: Crack, it hits her in the side,

5921
04:00:38.140 --> 04:00:39.470
her body barely shifts,

5922
04:00:39.470 --> 04:00:42.895
the rage absorbing the blow.
MARISHA: Stunning Strike.

5923
04:00:45.280 --> 04:00:46.690
MATT: 20.

5924
04:00:46.690 --> 04:00:47.523
MARISHA: Yeah.

5925
04:00:48.590 --> 04:00:51.990
MATT: Or 18, sorry, so yeah, she resists the stun.

5926
04:00:51.990 --> 04:00:54.220
MARISHA: So do I get my bonus?

5927
04:00:54.220 --> 04:00:56.437
MATT: You still have your bonus action, yeah.

5928
04:00:58.740 --> 04:01:01.560
MARISHA: Flurry of Blows. Pop pop.
MATT: Flurry of Blows. Go for it.

5929
04:01:01.560 --> 04:01:04.209
MARISHA: Attack one, attack two...

5930
04:01:04.209 --> 04:01:06.700
okay, okay, okay.

5931
04:01:06.700 --> 04:01:09.700
I rolled a natural 19 on the first one, so 29.

5932
04:01:09.700 --> 04:01:10.533
MATT: Yep.

5933
04:01:11.480 --> 04:01:13.180
MARISHA: That is a six on the dice,

5934
04:01:13.180 --> 04:01:15.513
so 12 total. Stunning Strike.

5935
04:01:20.160 --> 04:01:21.180
Come on.

5936
04:01:21.180 --> 04:01:22.380
MATT: 16.

5937
04:01:22.380 --> 04:01:23.213
MARISHA: No.

5938
04:01:25.306 --> 04:01:26.139
MATT: She's got a high constitution

5939
04:01:26.139 --> 04:01:28.260
saving throw. She's a barbarian.

5940
04:01:28.260 --> 04:01:32.430
MARISHA: I thought it was a wis-- no, Stunning Strike.

5941
04:01:32.430 --> 04:01:33.700
She is a barbarian.

5942
04:01:34.550 --> 04:01:36.050
Second one.

5943
04:01:36.050 --> 04:01:38.520
Second one is 19 to hit.

5944
04:01:38.520 --> 04:01:39.353
MATT: 19 does hit.

5945
04:01:42.110 --> 04:01:43.180
MARISHA: Seven damage.

5946
04:01:43.180 --> 04:01:44.930
MATT: Seven damage, all right.

5947
04:01:44.930 --> 04:01:48.580
These hits are (thudding). She's shrugging them off.

5948
04:01:48.580 --> 04:01:49.830
MARISHA: And

5949
04:01:55.857 --> 04:01:58.290
Stunning Strike again, one more time.

5950
04:01:58.290 --> 04:02:00.920
This was a bad idea. I'm burning through all my points.

5951
04:02:02.570 --> 04:02:03.410
MATT: 20.

5952
04:02:03.410 --> 04:02:04.580
MARISHA: Yeah.

5953
04:02:04.580 --> 04:02:07.160
MATT: Sorry, she rolled a 13.
SAM: Oh boy.

5954
04:02:07.160 --> 04:02:08.020
MARISHA: That's my turn.

5955
04:02:08.020 --> 04:02:09.720
MATT: All right, that finishes Beau's go.

5956
04:02:09.720 --> 04:02:10.553
Caleb, you doing anything?

5957
04:02:10.553 --> 04:02:13.743
You marking off a fourth turn?
LIAM: No.

5958
04:02:13.743 --> 04:02:15.380
I don't see this as feasible.

5959
04:02:15.380 --> 04:02:16.870
I shove the chalk back--
MATT: You don't see this,

5960
04:02:16.870 --> 04:02:19.140
by the way. Just so you know, you're hidden back here.

5961
04:02:19.140 --> 04:02:21.200
The tree line is blocking everything, but it's up to you.

5962
04:02:21.200 --> 04:02:22.950
If you hear the sound of this fighting

5963
04:02:22.950 --> 04:02:24.560
and you do what you want to do, go for it.

5964
04:02:24.560 --> 04:02:25.393
LIAM: That is what I'm going to do.

5965
04:02:25.393 --> 04:02:26.540
I'm going to shove the chalk away.

5966
04:02:26.540 --> 04:02:28.680
I'm going to abandon the Teleportation Circle.

5967
04:02:28.680 --> 04:02:30.580
I'm going to move at a diagonal this way

5968
04:02:30.580 --> 04:02:32.380
to see what the fuck is going on.

5969
04:02:32.380 --> 04:02:34.400
I know how long I have to draw

5970
04:02:34.400 --> 04:02:36.670
this circle and I don't believe it's going to happen.

5971
04:02:36.670 --> 04:02:39.650
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: So I'm going this way.

5972
04:02:39.650 --> 04:02:42.520
Do I see the fight happening?

5973
04:02:43.370 --> 04:02:44.260
MATT: You do.

5974
04:02:44.260 --> 04:02:45.526
LIAM: I cast--

5975
04:02:46.540 --> 04:02:48.770
I pull out molasses on my hand

5976
04:02:48.770 --> 04:02:53.770
and drag it and cast Slow on Obann and Yasha

5977
04:02:53.930 --> 04:02:54.980
only.

5978
04:02:54.980 --> 04:02:58.382
MATT: Obann and Yasha only. Okay.

5979
04:02:58.382 --> 04:02:59.215
That is a what save?

5980
04:02:59.215 --> 04:03:00.270
LIAM: 17.

5981
04:03:00.270 --> 04:03:02.350
MATT: Dexterity, right?

5982
04:03:02.350 --> 04:03:05.860
LIAM: No, I don't think that's correct. I think it is--

5983
04:03:07.760 --> 04:03:09.877
MATT: For Slow, or is it wisdom?

5984
04:03:12.190 --> 04:03:13.515
LIAM: Where is it?

5985
04:03:14.610 --> 04:03:16.300
Where is it?

5986
04:03:16.300 --> 04:03:17.300
Wisdom.

5987
04:03:17.300 --> 04:03:18.960
MATT: It is wisdom, okay, gotcha.

5988
04:03:18.960 --> 04:03:20.300
LIAM: 17.

5989
04:03:24.080 --> 04:03:26.520
MATT: Obann is a 20, he succeeds.
SAM: Damn it.

5990
04:03:26.520 --> 04:03:27.836
MATT: Yasha...

5991
04:03:29.280 --> 04:03:31.740
21, they rolled really high, sorry.

5992
04:03:31.740 --> 04:03:33.380
LIAM: It's fine, I'm out.

5993
04:03:33.380 --> 04:03:35.300
I've given up on the Teleportation Circle.

5994
04:03:35.300 --> 04:03:36.410
I don't think it's going to happen.

5995
04:03:36.410 --> 04:03:37.751
MATT: Okay.

5996
04:03:38.720 --> 04:03:40.880
MARISHA: Six rounds wasn't <i>that</i> long.

5997
04:03:40.880 --> 04:03:42.120
LIAM: It doesn't matter. The cat

5998
04:03:42.120 --> 04:03:43.530
is with Jester still.
MATT: It's too late now.

5999
04:03:43.530 --> 04:03:44.960
Your exit's out.

6000
04:03:44.960 --> 04:03:46.140
LIAM: Yeah.

6001
04:03:46.140 --> 04:03:49.565
MATT: Oh boy, all right, Jester, you and Yasha.

6002
04:03:49.565 --> 04:03:51.799
MARISHA: "Oh boy." Oh boy.
SAM: When your DM says "Oh boy."

6003
04:03:53.649 --> 04:03:55.090
LAURA: I'm going to have my duplicate

6004
04:03:55.090 --> 04:03:57.090
move out from behind the tree.

6005
04:03:57.090 --> 04:03:57.923
MATT: All righty.

6006
04:03:59.570 --> 04:04:04.570
LAURA: Holding the 50-gold diamond in my hand,

6007
04:04:04.810 --> 04:04:05.990
I'm going to have my duplicate

6008
04:04:05.990 --> 04:04:08.340
pull out what looks like another heart.

6009
04:04:09.750 --> 04:04:14.748
She's going to walk forward and cast Incite Greed.

6010
04:04:16.200 --> 04:04:18.400
SAM: What does that mean?

6011
04:04:18.400 --> 04:04:21.050
LAURA: She's going to make it look

6012
04:04:21.050 --> 04:04:22.741
like she's holding the heart.

6013
04:04:22.741 --> 04:04:24.191
She's going to say "I have it"

6014
04:04:24.191 --> 04:04:25.549
or she's not going to say shit.

6015
04:04:25.549 --> 04:04:28.330
She's just going to hold it up and walk forward.

6016
04:04:28.330 --> 04:04:32.760
So Incite Greed is a wisdom save of 17 of any

6017
04:04:32.760 --> 04:04:36.940
creatures that I choose within 30 feet of the spellcaster,

6018
04:04:36.940 --> 04:04:38.970
who is duplicate Jester.

6019
04:04:40.442 --> 04:04:43.380
She moves as far forward as she can,

6020
04:04:43.380 --> 04:04:45.640
to get them within range.

6021
04:04:45.640 --> 04:04:46.960
I don't know if Obann will be within range.

6022
04:04:46.960 --> 04:04:48.300
MATT: Obann will not be in range unfortunately.

6023
04:04:48.300 --> 04:04:50.310
LAURA: But the tree and Yasha, potentially.

6024
04:04:50.310 --> 04:04:51.450
MATT: You can move her 30 feet, right?

6025
04:04:51.450 --> 04:04:54.500
LAURA: Yeah, I can move her, yeah, 30 feet away from me,

6026
04:04:54.500 --> 04:04:56.442
up to 120 feet.

6027
04:04:57.800 --> 04:04:59.730
So they have to make a wisdom saving throw.

6028
04:04:59.730 --> 04:05:03.630
If they fail, then all they can do

6029
04:05:03.630 --> 04:05:05.580
is try to come towards

6030
04:05:06.540 --> 04:05:07.480
the heart.

6031
04:05:07.480 --> 04:05:11.340
MATT: Okay, you will miss Obann in this,
just so you're aware.

6032
04:05:11.340 --> 04:05:13.860
So Yasha makes her save, wisdom.

6033
04:05:14.700 --> 04:05:15.830
Ooh, that's a fail.

6034
04:05:16.740 --> 04:05:18.400
So Yasha,

6035
04:05:18.400 --> 04:05:21.430
who has blade in hand, about to turn on Beauregard,

6036
04:05:22.500 --> 04:05:25.600
looks back towards you suddenly and

6037
04:05:25.600 --> 04:05:28.450
one hand goes out reaching towards

6038
04:05:28.450 --> 04:05:32.220
the heart in illusory Jester's hand.

6039
04:05:32.220 --> 04:05:33.690
LAURA: What about the tree?

6040
04:05:33.690 --> 04:05:35.510
MATT: You're going for the tree as well. That's right.

6041
04:05:35.510 --> 04:05:36.876
The tree...

6042
04:05:39.380 --> 04:05:41.696
15, I believe that's a fail as well.

6043
04:05:41.696 --> 04:05:43.070
The tree also looks down towards you.

6044
04:05:43.070 --> 04:05:45.240
The creaking sound of its wood

6045
04:05:45.240 --> 04:05:48.230
twisting as it glances downward

6046
04:05:48.230 --> 04:05:50.420
and it looks like it's also looking towards the illusion.

6047
04:05:50.420 --> 04:05:51.610
SAM: Great.

6048
04:05:51.610 --> 04:05:54.100
Yes, yes, great.

6049
04:05:54.100 --> 04:05:56.990
MATT: All right, Yasha, for her turn

6050
04:05:56.990 --> 04:06:00.330
is going to move up.

6051
04:06:00.330 --> 04:06:01.900
MARISHA: Does she leave my combat range?

6052
04:06:01.900 --> 04:06:03.230
MATT: She does.

6053
04:06:03.230 --> 04:06:04.411
MARISHA: Sentinel.

6054
04:06:04.411 --> 04:06:07.025
MATT: All right, go for it.

6055
04:06:09.560 --> 04:06:11.070
MARISHA: 27.

6056
04:06:11.070 --> 04:06:13.040
MATT: 27, that hits.

6057
04:06:13.040 --> 04:06:14.720
LIAM: You're coming back.

6058
04:06:14.720 --> 04:06:16.095
MARISHA: She's distracted.

6059
04:06:17.320 --> 04:06:20.003
She's super on Jester.

6060
04:06:20.003 --> 04:06:20.982
12 damage.

6061
04:06:23.000 --> 04:06:26.430
MATT: Yasha is also no longer charmed by the spell.

6062
04:06:26.430 --> 04:06:27.950
MARISHA: Wait, what?
MATT: It breaks the charm.

6063
04:06:27.950 --> 04:06:29.280
MARISHA: It breaks the charm?
MATT: Yep.

6064
04:06:29.280 --> 04:06:31.300
LAURA: It doesn't say anything about attacking.

6065
04:06:31.300 --> 04:06:35.090
MATT: It says "while charmed in this way, a creature is

6066
04:06:35.090 --> 04:06:36.680
"charmed by you until the spell ends or until

6067
04:06:36.680 --> 04:06:40.550
"you or your companions do anything harmful to it."

6068
04:06:40.550 --> 04:06:43.380
So Yasha, as Yasha goes to run towards it,

6069
04:06:43.380 --> 04:06:46.563
turns back and looks right at you, even more furious.

6070
04:06:47.570 --> 04:06:49.471
Charm spells, man. It's a bitch.

6071
04:06:49.471 --> 04:06:53.630
LAURA: It doesn't say that on this description.

6072
04:06:53.630 --> 04:06:55.060
MATT: D&amp;D Beyond?
LAURA: Yeah, I would've said it.

6073
04:06:55.060 --> 04:06:57.380
It says when you cast a spell, present the gem.

6074
04:06:57.380 --> 04:07:00.040
Choose any number of creatures within range.

6075
04:07:00.040 --> 04:07:02.210
Succeed on a wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you.

6076
04:07:02.210 --> 04:07:03.043
SAM: It does say that.

6077
04:07:03.043 --> 04:07:04.350
LAURA: Anything harmful to it, got it.

6078
04:07:04.350 --> 04:07:06.039
MATT: Sorry.
MARISHA: Fuck.

6079
04:07:06.039 --> 04:07:07.690
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

6080
04:07:07.690 --> 04:07:12.660
MATT: But she stays there.
TALIESIN: And she ate a turn.

6081
04:07:12.660 --> 04:07:14.300
MARISHA: Sorry.

6082
04:07:14.300 --> 04:07:15.133
MATT: It's okay.

6083
04:07:15.133 --> 04:07:16.600
LAURA: Now we've just taken the tree out of the play.

6084
04:07:16.600 --> 04:07:17.630
MATT: Yasha dropped the charm before

6085
04:07:17.630 --> 04:07:19.710
she had taken all of her actions.

6086
04:07:19.710 --> 04:07:21.060
So she's going to turn on you.

6087
04:07:23.430 --> 04:07:24.410
TRAVIS: You said we took the tree out of the play?

6088
04:07:24.410 --> 04:07:25.280
MATT: Reckless.
LAURA: Took the tree out of the

6089
04:07:25.280 --> 04:07:27.600
play which was the one thing--
SAM: Which was fighting them.

6090
04:07:27.600 --> 04:07:29.430
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Is now fighting us?

6091
04:07:29.430 --> 04:07:31.398
LAURA: Well, not fighting us.

6092
04:07:31.398 --> 04:07:32.710
Just not fighting them.
LIAM: It's fighting everything.

6093
04:07:32.710 --> 04:07:35.780
It's opened up.
MATT: 23 to hit?

6094
04:07:35.780 --> 04:07:37.750
MARISHA: Yeah.

6095
04:07:37.750 --> 04:07:39.370
MATT: 18 to hit?

6096
04:07:39.370 --> 04:07:41.280
MARISHA: No.
MATT: Okay, 18 misses.

6097
04:07:41.280 --> 04:07:44.505
You suffer

6098
04:07:46.280 --> 04:07:48.250
13 points of slashing damage

6099
04:07:48.250 --> 04:07:50.000
from the Skingorger attacking Yasha

6100
04:07:50.992 --> 04:07:52.007
and because of her Necrotic Shroud,

6101
04:07:52.007 --> 04:07:54.020
you take an additional 10 points of necrotic damage.

6102
04:07:55.730 --> 04:07:57.370
MARISHA: So 23 total?
MATT: Correct.

6103
04:07:57.370 --> 04:07:59.120
MARISHA: I was at 61, right?

6104
04:08:00.050 --> 04:08:01.660
MATT: All righty.

6105
04:08:01.660 --> 04:08:03.240
It is now the wraith's turn.

6106
04:08:03.240 --> 04:08:05.242
The wraith is going to spend its turn

6107
04:08:05.242 --> 04:08:07.900
moving towards and trying to grab the gem

6108
04:08:07.900 --> 04:08:09.190
from the illusory Jester.
LAURA: It does nothing.

6109
04:08:09.190 --> 04:08:12.378
MATT: And it does nothing, which
frustrates the fuck out of it.

6110
04:08:13.290 --> 04:08:15.310
LAURA: It makes another wisdom saving throw.

6111
04:08:15.310 --> 04:08:16.470
MATT: Yeah and it's just like looking at it now

6112
04:08:16.470 --> 04:08:20.046
and it's trying to reach for it and not doing anything.

6113
04:08:20.046 --> 04:08:23.557
It just stays there. Fjord, you're up.

6114
04:08:23.557 --> 04:08:26.070
TRAVIS: I will move 30 feet out from behind

6115
04:08:26.070 --> 04:08:29.490
the tree and advance towards Obann and Yasha.

6116
04:08:30.370 --> 04:08:34.743
I will-- what is the distance from me to that group?

6117
04:08:36.150 --> 04:08:38.953
MATT: That group? You're looking about

6118
04:08:43.078 --> 04:08:44.948
80 or so feet to Obann

6119
04:08:46.000 --> 04:08:48.340
and 70 or so feet to Yasha.

6120
04:08:49.420 --> 04:08:52.321
TRAVIS: That does not do much.
LAURA: Who's got the whip?

6121
04:08:52.321 --> 04:08:53.788
TRAVIS: I do.

6122
04:08:57.664 --> 04:09:01.870
I will-- (babbling)

6123
04:09:02.970 --> 04:09:05.870
With my bonus action, I will

6124
04:09:07.880 --> 04:09:12.880
speak the command word to the Star-Razor and say "Galas Var"

6125
04:09:13.830 --> 04:09:17.690
and cause it to emit this blue glow.

6126
04:09:17.690 --> 04:09:20.050
MATT: The runes along his sword

6127
04:09:20.050 --> 04:09:22.550
bringing the light up with this blue radiant glow

6128
04:09:22.550 --> 04:09:26.260
that now begins to project off of the sword out to a range

6129
04:09:26.260 --> 04:09:29.850
as now this glowing beacon of blue, radiant energy.

6130
04:09:29.850 --> 04:09:32.510
TRAVIS: And I will fire two blasts

6131
04:09:33.494 --> 04:09:35.910
of Eldritch Blast at Obann.

6132
04:09:35.910 --> 04:09:37.780
MATT: At Obann, all righty.

6133
04:09:41.550 --> 04:09:43.450
TRAVIS: That is a 16

6134
04:09:43.450 --> 04:09:45.822
and a 23.

6135
04:09:46.720 --> 04:09:49.080
MATT: 16 misses, but the 23 hits.

6136
04:09:51.380 --> 04:09:56.380
TRAVIS: That is 11 points of Eldritch Blast damage.

6137
04:09:59.370 --> 04:10:01.870
MATT: 11 points to Obann, you got it.

6138
04:10:01.870 --> 04:10:02.703
That finish your turn, Fjord?

6139
04:10:02.703 --> 04:10:03.979
TRAVIS: Yes, it does.

6140
04:10:03.979 --> 04:10:05.010
SAM: Does he drop the heart and the skull?

6141
04:10:05.010 --> 04:10:06.654
MATT: No.

6142
04:10:06.654 --> 04:10:09.670
It is now Obann's turn.

6143
04:10:09.670 --> 04:10:14.670
Obann, having this, sees the fiddling with it, "Oh shit."

6144
04:10:14.710 --> 04:10:16.480
Looks around, You see him glancing around

6145
04:10:16.480 --> 04:10:17.970
for any sign of the Laughing Hand.

6146
04:10:17.970 --> 04:10:21.070
He goes, "Ah, we'll find him later."

6147
04:10:21.070 --> 04:10:24.112
He's going to swoop down towards Yasha

6148
04:10:27.041 --> 04:10:28.880
and he's going to reach out and say,

6149
04:10:28.880 --> 04:10:32.370
"Come, my love. We have work to do."

6150
04:10:32.370 --> 04:10:34.640
And he's going to attempt to--

6151
04:10:34.640 --> 04:10:37.127
MARISHA: Can she go? Can she leave?
MATT: --Plane Shift.

6152
04:10:37.127 --> 04:10:38.510
TRAVIS: There's only two of us that can stop this

6153
04:10:38.510 --> 04:10:41.880
and I still only have two spell slots.

6154
04:10:41.880 --> 04:10:43.080
LIAM: Doing Plane Shift?
MATT: Yeah.

6155
04:10:43.080 --> 04:10:45.239
LIAM: Counterspell.
SAM: You have one?!

6156
04:10:45.239 --> 04:10:46.672
MATT: What's the range on Counterspell?

6157
04:10:46.672 --> 04:10:48.040
LIAM: Let's find out.

6158
04:10:49.930 --> 04:10:51.720
60 feet. I'm too far away?

6159
04:10:51.720 --> 04:10:56.677
MATT: (counting) 60, 70 feet away.

6160
04:10:56.677 --> 04:10:57.510
He's out of range.

6161
04:10:57.510 --> 04:10:58.343
LIAM: All right.

6162
04:11:01.178 --> 04:11:02.913
MATT: He reaches out and grabs Yasha and the two--

6163
04:11:02.913 --> 04:11:06.030
MARISHA: Because she's stationary from Sentinel,

6164
04:11:06.030 --> 04:11:08.040
that doesn't matter?
MATT: It doesn't change at all.

6165
04:11:08.040 --> 04:11:09.706
LAURA: You know what? It's for the best.

6166
04:11:09.706 --> 04:11:10.650
We would have died if they would've stayed.

6167
04:11:10.650 --> 04:11:12.162
So fuck it.

6168
04:11:14.429 --> 04:11:16.430
LIAM: (groans)

6169
04:11:16.430 --> 04:11:18.290
MATT: Some bad rolls.

6170
04:11:18.290 --> 04:11:21.030
TRAVIS: No, that's okay, that's actually okay for us.

6171
04:11:21.030 --> 04:11:23.430
LAURA: This is the best it could be, honestly.

6172
04:11:23.430 --> 04:11:25.450
We would have died.
TRAVIS: 100%.

6173
04:11:25.450 --> 04:11:29.100
We need to get the fuck outta here.
TALIESIN: That would've been just a fucking murder.

6174
04:11:29.100 --> 04:11:29.933
TRAVIS: But we still have the pissed off tree.

6175
04:11:29.933 --> 04:11:30.890
TALIESIN: We still have a giant tree and then

6176
04:11:30.890 --> 04:11:33.190
we have to hide so that the Laughing Hand doesn't find us.

6177
04:11:33.190 --> 04:11:36.150
LAURA: No, Caleb can do the spell, right?

6178
04:11:36.150 --> 04:11:39.570
You have enough time now. You can do a Teleportation?

6179
04:11:39.570 --> 04:11:44.390
MARISHA: What if we kill the Laughing Hand while we're here?

6180
04:11:44.390 --> 04:11:45.990
Can we kill the Laughing Hand while we're here?

6181
04:11:45.990 --> 04:11:50.835
He keeps talking about his pact and his chain.

6182
04:11:50.835 --> 04:11:53.072
TRAVIS: I think he went to the Laughing Hand.

6183
04:11:54.393 --> 04:11:55.440
MARISHA: No, he Plane Shifted.

6184
04:11:55.440 --> 04:11:57.940
If he Plane Shifted, he's on another plane.

6185
04:11:57.940 --> 04:11:59.620
TALIESIN: I don't think we can take the Laughing Hand.

6186
04:11:59.620 --> 04:12:00.880
We are tapped.

6187
04:12:00.880 --> 04:12:03.290
LAURA: We have nothing.
TRAVIS: Saves and damage.

6188
04:12:03.290 --> 04:12:04.420
TALIESIN: We will all be working for

6189
04:12:04.420 --> 04:12:06.170
the Laughing Hand before the end of that fight.

6190
04:12:06.170 --> 04:12:07.810
TRAVIS: We got to safety try and get out of here.

6191
04:12:07.810 --> 04:12:09.504
TALIESIN: Yeah, that is not--

6192
04:12:09.504 --> 04:12:10.390
SAM: Can we teleport

6193
04:12:10.390 --> 04:12:14.770
the Laughing Hand back to Xhorhas?

6194
04:12:14.770 --> 04:12:16.738
With our teleportation.

6195
04:12:16.738 --> 04:12:18.379
LIAM: What's our next step of the combat action?

6196
04:12:18.379 --> 04:12:19.260
What's going on?

6197
04:12:19.260 --> 04:12:20.740
What's the tree doing?

6198
04:12:20.740 --> 04:12:24.870
MATT: The tree's just staring at Jester's spell.

6199
04:12:24.870 --> 04:12:26.880
But we'll come around to that, so Nott, you're up.

6200
04:12:26.880 --> 04:12:29.470
You watched Obann vanish with Yasha.

6201
04:12:30.347 --> 04:12:31.284
TRAVIS: It's okay.

6202
04:12:31.284 --> 04:12:32.290
SAM: Damn it.

6203
04:12:33.240 --> 04:12:34.320
Are we trying to kill this tree?

6204
04:12:34.320 --> 04:12:35.153
TRAVIS: No, no, no.
LAURA: No.

6205
04:12:35.153 --> 04:12:37.236
We just need to get away.

6206
04:12:38.070 --> 04:12:39.180
SAM: I will disengage and run

6207
04:12:39.180 --> 04:12:41.410
as far back towards Caleb as possible.

6208
04:12:43.180 --> 04:12:45.470
TRAVIS: Unless Obann grabbed the gallbladder

6209
04:12:45.470 --> 04:12:47.100
and didn't actually get the heart.

6210
04:12:48.030 --> 04:12:49.030
LAURA: Yeah.

6211
04:12:53.260 --> 04:12:55.300
SAM: I mean the Laughing Hand's our friend still.

6212
04:12:55.300 --> 04:12:57.300
LAURA: No, he's not.
TALIESIN: No, not anymore.

6213
04:12:57.300 --> 04:12:59.810
One hour.
TRAVIS: One hour.

6214
04:12:59.810 --> 04:13:00.962
SAM: It's been an hour?

6215
04:13:00.962 --> 04:13:02.237
TRAVIS: He's about an hour and a half away.

6216
04:13:02.237 --> 04:13:03.490
MATT: You got about three minutes.

6217
04:13:03.490 --> 04:13:06.943
TALIESIN: And then he's going to realize
he got messed with by us.

6218
04:13:06.943 --> 04:13:08.440
TRAVIS: But he's also on the outside perimeter.

6219
04:13:08.440 --> 04:13:09.480
We just need to not waste time.

6220
04:13:09.480 --> 04:13:11.950
LAURA: Go back to the Teleportation Circle
and finish it and go.

6221
04:13:11.950 --> 04:13:14.128
MATT: All right, Beau, Caleb?

6222
04:13:15.220 --> 04:13:18.630
LIAM: I'll start making my way over to the Circle.

6223
04:13:18.630 --> 04:13:21.070
I think I used all my movement to get there.

6224
04:13:21.070 --> 04:13:24.100
So one thing of movement and I will start to draw.

6225
04:13:24.100 --> 04:13:27.250
MATT: All right, so another minute beginning in the Circle.

6226
04:13:27.250 --> 04:13:28.380
LIAM: Oh, we start over fresh?

6227
04:13:28.380 --> 04:13:30.120
I mean I've drawn on the ground, right?

6228
04:13:30.120 --> 04:13:32.020
Do we pick up where we left off or do we start over?

6229
04:13:32.020 --> 04:13:33.460
MATT: Realistically, no.

6230
04:13:33.460 --> 04:13:35.380
LIAM: Do I have enough chalk to do it?

6231
04:13:35.380 --> 04:13:39.170
MATT: As you walk away, the sigil vanishes for a second.

6232
04:13:39.170 --> 04:13:40.980
LIAM: Do I have enough chalk to do it?

6233
04:13:40.980 --> 04:13:41.830
MATT: We'll say yes, you do.

6234
04:13:41.830 --> 04:13:43.280
LIAM: Okay, all right.

6235
04:13:43.280 --> 04:13:45.370
MATT: But you don't get to just continue

6236
04:13:45.370 --> 04:13:47.660
the spell you were in the process of doing before.

6237
04:13:47.660 --> 04:13:49.326
LIAM: Understood.
MATT: You have to do it over again.

6238
04:13:49.326 --> 04:13:50.743
LIAM: You got it.

6239
04:13:52.420 --> 04:13:55.440
SAM: Oh boy, guys.

6240
04:13:55.440 --> 04:13:57.600
MARISHA: Is the tree pissed off at me?

6241
04:13:57.600 --> 04:13:59.150
Do I get a sense that he's mad?

6242
04:13:59.150 --> 04:14:01.930
MATT: The tree is currently focused on Jester's Duplicate.

6243
04:14:01.930 --> 04:14:03.300
LAURA: Then run away, just get away from it.

6244
04:14:03.300 --> 04:14:06.902
TRAVIS: How does it feel about our relationship right now?

6245
04:14:06.902 --> 04:14:10.886
MARISHA: I'm going to disengage and wait for the--

6246
04:14:10.886 --> 04:14:13.950
do I need to disengage? Am I in his melee range?

6247
04:14:13.950 --> 04:14:14.783
MATT: No.

6248
04:14:14.783 --> 04:14:16.170
MARISHA: Then no, I'm not going to spend a ki point.

6249
04:14:16.170 --> 04:14:17.121
I'm just going to run.

6250
04:14:17.121 --> 04:14:20.460
Then I'm going to gouge my eyes out with my staff.

6251
04:14:21.433 --> 04:14:22.740
MATT: Careful with that pencil!

6252
04:14:22.740 --> 04:14:25.070
TALIESIN: I know, that's how
every accident has ever happened.

6253
04:14:25.070 --> 04:14:26.880
MATT: Yeah, don't do that.

6254
04:14:26.880 --> 04:14:29.636
MARISHA: I am very conscious.
ALL: Don't do it!

6255
04:14:29.636 --> 04:14:31.630
(laughter)

6256
04:14:31.630 --> 04:14:32.820
MATT: (weakly) As your husband...

6257
04:14:32.820 --> 04:14:34.652
MARISHA: It's not even a sharp pencil.

6258
04:14:34.652 --> 04:14:36.732
MATT: It doesn't have to be.
LAURA: It's still could do some damage.

6259
04:14:36.732 --> 04:14:38.824
MATT: It's all good.
SAM: No sharp objects here.

6260
04:14:38.824 --> 04:14:42.124
MARISHA: Give me back my shit! Don't patronize me!

6261
04:14:42.124 --> 04:14:43.782
Goddamn it, go.

6262
04:14:43.782 --> 04:14:44.920
LIAM: Took away my journal.

6263
04:14:44.920 --> 04:14:46.200
MARISHA: Fucking A.

6264
04:14:46.200 --> 04:14:48.741
MATT: It's all good, all right, so.

6265
04:14:48.741 --> 04:14:49.772
TALIESIN: Okay.

6266
04:14:49.772 --> 04:14:51.020
MATT: This thing is distracted for up

6267
04:14:51.020 --> 04:14:52.340
to the minute that you concentrated on the spell,

6268
04:14:52.340 --> 04:14:54.080
which should give you just enough time to prepare

6269
04:14:54.080 --> 04:14:56.100
the circle.

6270
04:14:56.100 --> 04:14:59.070
You guys go and gather near Caleb.

6271
04:14:59.070 --> 04:15:01.110
The tree is still focused on the illusion

6272
04:15:01.110 --> 04:15:03.320
that you stay within the range to maintain.

6273
04:15:03.320 --> 04:15:04.153
TRAVIS: Nice.

6274
04:15:04.153 --> 04:15:07.630
MATT: Right as that begins to fade and the tree turns,

6275
04:15:07.630 --> 04:15:09.970
on the very edge you can see running,

6276
04:15:09.970 --> 04:15:13.488
lumbering out of the side of the darkness (stomping),

6277
04:15:15.834 --> 04:15:18.023
the Laughing Hand.

6278
04:15:18.023 --> 04:15:19.548
LAURA: (announcer voice) Round three!

6279
04:15:20.490 --> 04:15:21.400
MATT: You finish the Circle.

6280
04:15:21.400 --> 04:15:23.100
TRAVIS: (high voice) You can stay on the perimeter.

6281
04:15:23.100 --> 04:15:25.800
MATT: You guys all rush in.

6282
04:15:25.800 --> 04:15:27.630
LIAM: Rosohna.

6283
04:15:27.630 --> 04:15:29.457
MATT: All right.

6284
04:15:29.457 --> 04:15:31.010
(swooshing)

6285
04:15:31.010 --> 04:15:34.090
You all vanish back to the core

6286
04:15:35.560 --> 04:15:36.870
of the Dynasty.

6287
04:15:36.870 --> 04:15:38.090
LIAM: Unsatisfied.

6288
04:15:38.090 --> 04:15:39.790
TRAVIS: I don't know, I'm okay.

6289
04:15:39.790 --> 04:15:41.590
MARISHA: It feels bad, man.
SAM: You're okay?!

6290
04:15:41.590 --> 04:15:43.830
TALIESIN: This is as close to a win as we were going to get,

6291
04:15:43.830 --> 04:15:45.330
which is no one's dead.
MARISHA: No!

6292
04:15:45.330 --> 04:15:46.970
No, we could've got fucking--

6293
04:15:46.970 --> 04:15:47.940
MATT: You could have gotten it.

6294
04:15:47.940 --> 04:15:49.310
SAM: We were one roll away

6295
04:15:49.310 --> 04:15:51.368
from getting that thing.
MATT: I know.

6296
04:15:51.368 --> 04:15:52.800
He rolled really high on trying to pull it out of the tree.

6297
04:15:52.800 --> 04:15:55.140
I didn't know how long it'd take him. I'm sorry.

6298
04:15:56.420 --> 04:15:57.640
TRAVIS: He got it pretty quick.

6299
04:15:57.640 --> 04:15:59.640
SAM: He got it in one round!

6300
04:15:59.640 --> 04:16:01.790
TALIESIN: All things considered this
is as good as it could've went.

6301
04:16:01.790 --> 04:16:03.080
LAURA: Sweet, I'm out.

6302
04:16:03.080 --> 04:16:05.010
MARISHA: I fucking beg to differ.

6303
04:16:05.010 --> 04:16:07.180
It's not as good as it could've fucking went.

6304
04:16:07.180 --> 04:16:08.013
LIAM: Good as it could've went

6305
04:16:08.013 --> 04:16:09.740
would've been us with the skull!

6306
04:16:09.740 --> 04:16:11.059
MARISHA: Fucking winning!
LIAM: And winning!

6307
04:16:11.059 --> 04:16:12.219
MARISHA: I agree with what he's saying!

6308
04:16:12.219 --> 04:16:14.820
TALIESIN: This is the best losing we could've had.

6309
04:16:14.820 --> 04:16:15.830
LAURA: Yeah, well.

6310
04:16:15.830 --> 04:16:17.083
MATT: It's true.

6311
04:16:17.083 --> 04:16:17.916
TRAVIS: That is correct.

6312
04:16:17.916 --> 04:16:21.400
TALIESIN: I'm okay with a good loss.
TRAVIS: It is the best loss.

6313
04:16:21.400 --> 04:16:23.170
MARISHA: No!
SAM: It was definitely a loss.

6314
04:16:23.170 --> 04:16:25.078
MARISHA: It was definitely a fucking loss.

6315
04:16:25.078 --> 04:16:26.980
LIAM: The humans are pissed off.
MARISHA: Yes!

6316
04:16:26.980 --> 04:16:29.164
LAURA: But you know what, we're not dead.

6317
04:16:29.164 --> 04:16:29.997
MARISHA: We have a short amount of time

6318
04:16:29.997 --> 04:16:31.340
to make an impact and we lost.

6319
04:16:31.340 --> 04:16:32.800
LIAM: We've got 80 years to make

6320
04:16:32.800 --> 04:16:35.970
our mark on this world and it's gone!

6321
04:16:35.970 --> 04:16:38.070
SAM: (tearfully) I only have 30!

6322
04:16:38.070 --> 04:16:41.978
(laughter)

6323
04:16:43.710 --> 04:16:45.956
MATT: Well then.
TALIESIN: Shit.

6324
04:16:45.956 --> 04:16:48.300
That was so stressful.

6325
04:16:48.300 --> 04:16:49.133
MARISHA: Goddamn it.

6326
04:16:49.133 --> 04:16:51.670
LIAM: You're a halfling and we will work on that.

6327
04:16:51.670 --> 04:16:54.460
TALIESIN: I did still have Turn Undead and Blight.

6328
04:16:54.460 --> 04:16:55.901
LAURA: Oh, nice.

6329
04:16:55.901 --> 04:16:58.060
LIAM: I had a lot of spell slots left. We could have fought.

6330
04:16:59.180 --> 04:17:01.460
TALIESIN: I had my auto Turn Undeads.

6331
04:17:01.460 --> 04:17:03.440
LIAM: Caleb wanted to fight.
LAURA: Yeah, we know.

6332
04:17:03.440 --> 04:17:04.850
That's why he fucking abandoned

6333
04:17:04.850 --> 04:17:07.565
the Teleportation Circle and doomed us all to die.

6334
04:17:07.565 --> 04:17:08.409
MARISHA: It's true.

6335
04:17:08.409 --> 04:17:10.770
LIAM: For all those rounds that never fucking happened.

6336
04:17:11.610 --> 04:17:12.710
MATT: It's all good, guys.

6337
04:17:12.710 --> 04:17:15.487
TALIESIN: We're alive.
SAM: Everyone made mistakes,

6338
04:17:15.487 --> 04:17:16.571
except for me.

6339
04:17:16.571 --> 04:17:18.650
(laughter)

6340
04:17:18.650 --> 04:17:20.350
MARISHA: I feel pretty confident about my choices.

6341
04:17:20.350 --> 04:17:23.050
LAURA: Your mistake was rolling really low.

6342
04:17:23.050 --> 04:17:24.170
MARISHA: Now I'm just breaking a pencil

6343
04:17:24.170 --> 04:17:26.170
into tiny shards over here.

6344
04:17:27.165 --> 04:17:28.570
TRAVIS: Those are small pieces.
MARISHA: Yeah.

6345
04:17:28.570 --> 04:17:31.310
MATT: Well guys, I mean...

6346
04:17:31.310 --> 04:17:32.750
TRAVIS: We're alive!
TALIESIN: We're alive!

6347
04:17:32.750 --> 04:17:34.970
MATT: You're alive

6348
04:17:34.970 --> 04:17:37.670
and we'll continue this in a couple weeks.

6349
04:17:37.670 --> 04:17:38.503
LIAM: Fuck!

6350
04:17:38.503 --> 04:17:40.160
TRAVIS: Now it's timeout.
LIAM: Goddamn it!

6351
04:17:40.160 --> 04:17:41.772
MATT: I know it's frustrating, I'm sorry.

6352
04:17:41.772 --> 04:17:43.080
TALIESIN: You got to fire your sword finally.

6353
04:17:43.080 --> 04:17:44.722
And make it glow.

6354
04:17:44.722 --> 04:17:47.600
LAURA: You used your cool sword.
TRAVIS: (humming)

6355
04:17:47.600 --> 04:17:51.260
TALIESIN: Lightsaber up, lightsaber down.

6356
04:17:51.260 --> 04:17:54.100
MARISHA: Mighty Nein hasn't had a victory in some time.

6357
04:17:54.100 --> 04:17:56.400
LAURA: Yeah, Mighty Nein is like--
MARISHA: It fucking sucks.

6358
04:17:56.400 --> 04:17:57.560
LAURA: The big no.

6359
04:17:57.560 --> 04:17:59.220
MARISHA: The big no.
LAURA: Just a big fucking no.

6360
04:17:59.220 --> 04:18:02.280
MARISHA: I'm going to keep fucking
shattering pieces over here.

6361
04:18:02.280 --> 04:18:04.710
TALIESIN: Everyone loves a loser. We're good.

6362
04:18:04.710 --> 04:18:08.560
TRAVIS: There were many TPK moments in that, though.

6363
04:18:08.560 --> 04:18:11.320
We really scraped by.
MATT: You guys made some,

6364
04:18:11.320 --> 04:18:14.540
some clever fucking things that avoided some

6365
04:18:15.600 --> 04:18:17.440
serious challenges here.

6366
04:18:17.440 --> 04:18:19.020
TRAVIS: Remember, the idea was to get there

6367
04:18:19.020 --> 04:18:21.720
before they did and get out undetected.

6368
04:18:21.720 --> 04:18:25.750
We were in their shit the whole time and we lived.

6369
04:18:25.750 --> 04:18:26.583
That's okay.

6370
04:18:26.583 --> 04:18:28.340
TALIESIN: If we had gotten here before them,

6371
04:18:28.340 --> 04:18:31.490
I deeply believe we could've pulled this off.

6372
04:18:31.490 --> 04:18:33.230
TRAVIS: Yeah, if we got here before,
but that just didn't happen.

6373
04:18:33.230 --> 04:18:34.430
MARISHA: I still feel like we should've

6374
04:18:34.430 --> 04:18:36.490
pulled it off when we had the chance, man.

6375
04:18:36.490 --> 04:18:38.940
We should've swiped his shit before we even got here.

6376
04:18:38.940 --> 04:18:40.720
TALIESIN: I think the Laughing Hand and three hounds

6377
04:18:40.720 --> 04:18:42.670
would've shown up and we would've died in one round.

6378
04:18:42.670 --> 04:18:45.170
SAM: You know when we can always guarantee a victory?

6379
04:18:46.382 --> 04:18:48.023
When we dine on Wendy's food.

6380
04:18:48.023 --> 04:18:49.840
(laughter)

6381
04:18:49.840 --> 04:18:54.042
LIAM: Tune in next week for whatever
the fuck that is going to be.

6382
04:18:55.790 --> 04:18:58.540
SAM: You always win with Wendy's.

6383
04:19:02.870 --> 04:19:04.970
MARISHA: They don't even know.
TALIESIN: It's so insane.

6384
04:19:05.821 --> 04:19:07.700
LIAM: Let the humbling begin.

6385
04:19:07.700 --> 04:19:09.200
MATT: Yeah.
LAURA: The humbling is here.

6386
04:19:09.200 --> 04:19:12.360
MATT: The humbling is here, but we'll continue

6387
04:19:12.360 --> 04:19:14.710
the next leg of this venture in a couple weeks.

6388
04:19:15.590 --> 04:19:17.840
Until then, we love you guys,

6389
04:19:17.840 --> 04:19:20.820
we love you very much, and is it Thursday yet?

6390
04:19:20.820 --> 04:19:22.958
Goodnight.
LIAM: It's Wendy's Thursday.

6391
04:19:22.958 --> 04:19:25.395
TRAVIS: ♪ Goodbye ♪

6392

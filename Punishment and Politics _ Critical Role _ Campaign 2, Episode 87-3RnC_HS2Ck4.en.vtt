00:00:00.056 --> 00:00:01.885
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode

2
00:00:01.885 --> 00:00:03.701
of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

3
00:00:03.701 --> 00:00:05.515
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

4
00:00:05.515 --> 00:00:07.767
ALL: We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

5
00:00:07.767 --> 00:00:10.184
LIAM: We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

6
00:00:11.026 --> 00:00:12.829
MARISHA: Wow.
ASHLEY: Oh.

7
00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:14.761
TALIESIN: Read the room, man.
MATT: It's been two weeks.

8
00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:16.907
Some people are still coming online.

9
00:00:16.907 --> 00:00:18.275
(laughter)

10
00:00:18.275 --> 00:00:20.703
LIAM: See you in an hour.
MATT: Exactly.

11
00:00:20.703 --> 00:00:22.375
Before we get started on tonight's session,

12
00:00:22.375 --> 00:00:23.856
we're going to go ahead and jump into our announcements

13
00:00:23.856 --> 00:00:26.578
real fast, beginning with our fantastic returning sponsor,

14
00:00:26.578 --> 00:00:29.629
we have two tonight, our first one is Nord VPN.

15
00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:30.940
Sam, if you don't mind.

16
00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.918
SAM: Flame on!

17
00:00:32.918 --> 00:00:35.171
It's the master of the dark net, you know me

18
00:00:35.171 --> 00:00:40.171
by my haxxor handle, BlackWillow73@aol.com.

19
00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:43.615
I just got back from Def Con, and I'm already

20
00:00:43.615 --> 00:00:47.384
spinning my webs, pwning low rezzers and fragging

21
00:00:47.384 --> 00:00:52.384
cy channels on my Vulcan nerve hack, staying leet.

22
00:00:52.555 --> 00:00:56.128
Now, some net scrapers say I should use Nord VPN

23
00:00:56.128 --> 00:00:59.072
to protect my system when I plug in.

24
00:00:59.072 --> 00:01:01.671
But nah, you're looking at the rastor blaster.

25
00:01:01.671 --> 00:01:03.117
I'm hard-wired.

26
00:01:03.117 --> 00:01:05.639
Ain't no noobs nailing my nano-bytes.

27
00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:08.763
So let's jack into the mainframe.

28
00:01:08.763 --> 00:01:09.596
Oh!

29
00:01:10.464 --> 00:01:11.949
Here we go.

30
00:01:11.949 --> 00:01:13.369
CPU replicator?

31
00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.084
Psh, I'll crash the code.

32
00:01:15.084 --> 00:01:17.395
Over-cranked credit scanner bot?

33
00:01:17.395 --> 00:01:20.513
No problem, I'll re-route the trapdoor.

34
00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:21.534
Password?

35
00:01:21.534 --> 00:01:24.813
Psh, it's swordfish, it's always swordfish.

36
00:01:24.813 --> 00:01:26.821
(laughter)
(alarm wailing)

37
00:01:26.821 --> 00:01:28.473
What, uh-oh, uh-oh!

38
00:01:28.473 --> 00:01:30.232
What's this?

39
00:01:30.232 --> 00:01:31.966
Red code virus?

40
00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:33.955
Two-factor memory leak?

41
00:01:33.955 --> 00:01:35.618
I've been sliced?!

42
00:01:35.618 --> 00:01:38.552
But who could've done this?

43
00:01:38.552 --> 00:01:40.444
(CryptonicOverride laughing)

44
00:01:40.444 --> 00:01:43.598
CryptonicOverride (VO): It is I, CryptonicOverride.

45
00:01:43.598 --> 00:01:46.534
The most leet haxxor in dark net.

46
00:01:46.534 --> 00:01:50.309
And today, I shall hack you, BlackWillow73.

47
00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:51.371
SAM: What?

48
00:01:51.371 --> 00:01:53.979
The hacker has become the hackee?

49
00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.703
Nobody wipes BlackWillow73.

50
00:01:56.703 --> 00:01:58.185
Only one thing to do.

51
00:01:58.185 --> 00:02:00.510
I need my friends at Nord VPN.

52
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:01.956
(laughter)

53
00:02:01.956 --> 00:02:03.395
TRAVIS: Oh man.

54
00:02:03.395 --> 00:02:04.228
SAM: Yep.

55
00:02:04.228 --> 00:02:06.789
A personal virtual private network service provider

56
00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:09.547
with more than 5000 servers in 60 countries.

57
00:02:09.547 --> 00:02:11.531
Hold on, getting a call.

58
00:02:11.531 --> 00:02:13.258
I'll just put it on hold.

59
00:02:13.258 --> 00:02:16.697
They're also the sponsor of today's Critical Role episode.

60
00:02:16.697 --> 00:02:20.713
Just going to boot up my Nord VPN fail-safe disk.

61
00:02:20.713 --> 00:02:21.553
TALIESIN: Wow.

62
00:02:21.553 --> 00:02:22.586
LIAM: Wow!

63
00:02:22.586 --> 00:02:23.472
LAURA: Yeah!

64
00:02:23.472 --> 00:02:24.335
SAM: Yes.

65
00:02:24.335 --> 00:02:25.865
LAURA: That's so cool.

66
00:02:25.865 --> 00:02:27.718
SAM: Okay, unmapping the screensaver.

67
00:02:27.718 --> 00:02:29.564
Repatching the Y2K.

68
00:02:29.564 --> 00:02:31.227
Gleaming the cube!

69
00:02:31.227 --> 00:02:32.115
Yes!

70
00:02:32.115 --> 00:02:35.832
CybertronicOverride has been iced out!

71
00:02:35.832 --> 00:02:36.789
CryptonicOverride (VO): No!

72
00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:38.635
Damn you, Nord VPN.

73
00:02:38.635 --> 00:02:41.311
You foiled my hack once again.

74
00:02:41.311 --> 00:02:43.538
But soon I will defeat you, and find

75
00:02:43.538 --> 00:02:46.472
the true source of the Ultra Codex.

76
00:02:46.472 --> 00:02:49.033
Your days are numbered, BlackWillow.

77
00:02:49.033 --> 00:02:49.883
SAM: Whoa.

78
00:02:49.883 --> 00:02:50.734
TALIESIN: Wow.

79
00:02:50.734 --> 00:02:51.567
TRAVIS: Whoa.

80
00:02:51.567 --> 00:02:54.312
SAM: Guys, cyber security may seem complex,

81
00:02:54.312 --> 00:02:57.073
but Nord VPN makes it easy, with their

82
00:02:57.073 --> 00:03:00.658
cutting edge technology that shields your internet activity

83
00:03:00.658 --> 00:03:04.003
from hackers, protects you on public wifi networks,

84
00:03:04.003 --> 00:03:05.733
and even blocks annoying ads.

85
00:03:05.733 --> 00:03:08.476
Right now they're offering some amazing holiday deals,

86
00:03:08.476 --> 00:03:10.597
including, and I'm not making this up,

87
00:03:10.597 --> 00:03:14.364
an 81% discount off a three-year plan,

88
00:03:14.364 --> 00:03:18.091
and special gifts like bonus membership months

89
00:03:18.091 --> 00:03:21.218
and their password manager app, Nord Pass.

90
00:03:21.218 --> 00:03:22.977
You can find all these deals at our landing page,

91
00:03:22.977 --> 00:03:26.561
nordvpn.com/criticalrole, or use coupon code

92
00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:28.329
criticalrole at checkout.

93
00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:30.863
But who was CryptonicOverride?

94
00:03:30.863 --> 00:03:32.735
What is the Ultra Codex?

95
00:03:32.735 --> 00:03:35.107
Who will get sliced next?

96
00:03:35.107 --> 00:03:38.069
Find out the next time Nord VPN sponsors this show.

97
00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.841
(laughter)

98
00:03:40.841 --> 00:03:43.155
Matt, hack to you.

99
00:03:43.155 --> 00:03:44.425
(groaning)

100
00:03:44.425 --> 00:03:46.012
TALIESIN: Oh, wow.
LIAM: Wow.

101
00:03:46.012 --> 00:03:48.518
ASHLEY: Did they send you those floppy disks?

102
00:03:48.518 --> 00:03:51.033
Like the AOL, you know?

103
00:03:51.033 --> 00:03:54.303
TRAVIS: Whoa, these are actually rarities.

104
00:03:54.303 --> 00:03:57.074
ASHLEY: I actually use Nord VPN, guys.

105
00:03:57.074 --> 00:03:58.344
Good stuff.

106
00:03:58.344 --> 00:04:00.742
LIAM: This new cyberpunk reboot is weird.

107
00:04:00.742 --> 00:04:02.592
MATT: Yeah.

108
00:04:02.592 --> 00:04:05.333
Yeah, it's a fun prequel to the upcoming

109
00:04:05.333 --> 00:04:07.011
CD Projekt Red game.

110
00:04:07.011 --> 00:04:08.314
It's all in canon.

111
00:04:08.314 --> 00:04:10.595
TRAVIS: I'm pretty sure those Memorex floppy drives

112
00:04:10.595 --> 00:04:13.086
are very expensive, so let's not lose those.

113
00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:15.078
MATT: Yeah.

114
00:04:15.078 --> 00:04:17.461
Thank you, Sam.
MARISHA: Isn't that what the nuclear codes are on?

115
00:04:17.461 --> 00:04:19.469
TRAVIS: That's what I heard.
LIAM: Bringing me back, man.

116
00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:21.636
MATT: And thank you, Nord VPN.

117
00:04:22.491 --> 00:04:24.615
Our second sponsor tonight are our friends

118
00:04:24.615 --> 00:04:27.525
and returning sponsor from the beginning of this campaign

119
00:04:27.525 --> 00:04:30.257
up until now, our friends at D&amp;D Beyond.

120
00:04:30.257 --> 00:04:31.326
TRAVIS: D&amp;D Beyond!

121
00:04:31.326 --> 00:04:33.913
MATT: If you haven't had the opportunity
yet to check it out,

122
00:04:33.913 --> 00:04:35.044
I'm sure you've heard things here and there.

123
00:04:35.044 --> 00:04:37.315
It's a great online tool for creating D&amp;D characters,

124
00:04:37.315 --> 00:04:39.173
for organizing your campaign. It's a bunch of resources

125
00:04:39.173 --> 00:04:42.717
for spells, items, both homebrew and official

126
00:04:42.717 --> 00:04:46.607
in the actual world of Wizards of the Coast D&amp;D.

127
00:04:46.607 --> 00:04:49.313
They're awesome, they allow this man to do other crazy stuff

128
00:04:49.313 --> 00:04:52.534
outside of this hacker hood, and the escalation

129
00:04:52.534 --> 00:04:54.372
is scaring me, to be perfectly honest.

130
00:04:54.372 --> 00:04:55.537
LAURA: That was Sam all along?

131
00:04:55.537 --> 00:04:57.437
SAM: Don't use your facial recognition on me!

132
00:04:57.437 --> 00:05:00.368
(laughter)

133
00:05:00.368 --> 00:05:04.678
MATT: Find out more at dndbeyond.link/criticalrole.

134
00:05:04.678 --> 00:05:06.807
Thank you, guys.

135
00:05:06.807 --> 00:05:08.575
We have a few more announcements. Travis?

136
00:05:08.575 --> 00:05:10.382
TRAVIS: Yeah, oh, I feel like Sam just lost

137
00:05:10.382 --> 00:05:12.794
10 pounds of water weight in that raincoat.

138
00:05:12.794 --> 00:05:14.829
SAM: It doesn't breathe, this jacket.

139
00:05:14.829 --> 00:05:16.252
(laughter)

140
00:05:16.252 --> 00:05:18.945
TRAVIS: A massive and huge thanks to everyone that donated

141
00:05:18.945 --> 00:05:22.871
for our November fundraising campaign with OSD.

142
00:05:22.871 --> 00:05:24.056
MARISHA: OSD!

143
00:05:24.056 --> 00:05:29.056
TRAVIS: You guys are amazing. Together,
we raised over $44,000.

144
00:05:29.075 --> 00:05:30.029
MARISHA: Hell yeah.

145
00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:34.192
TRAVIS: And we were able to help over 1250 veterans

146
00:05:34.192 --> 00:05:36.168
and active duty service members.

147
00:05:36.168 --> 00:05:37.850
MATT: Yeah!
TRAVIS: That is amazing.

148
00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:39.858
MATT: Thank you guys so much.
TRAVIS: Thank you guys for that.

149
00:05:39.858 --> 00:05:42.416
It's incredible. Also thank you again to Travis Frederick

150
00:05:42.416 --> 00:05:44.052
for his generous donations.

151
00:05:44.052 --> 00:05:46.557
It's an incredible accomplishment, and we are so proud again

152
00:05:46.557 --> 00:05:48.820
of what our community is able to do in the world.

153
00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.182
So thank you, guys. Love ya.

154
00:05:50.182 --> 00:05:52.314
MATT: Thank you, guys.

155
00:05:52.314 --> 00:05:54.017
Laura, you got a few announcements.

156
00:05:54.017 --> 00:05:56.437
LAURA: Oh, who's wearing them, who's wearing them?

157
00:05:56.437 --> 00:05:59.315
We got these badass-- is that on?

158
00:05:59.315 --> 00:06:00.290
SAM: I don't know.

159
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.332
LAURA: No, don't do-- put it back, put it down.

160
00:06:02.332 --> 00:06:05.326
TALIESIN: What is that?
LAURA: It's got Vox Machina on the back.

161
00:06:05.326 --> 00:06:06.538
MATT: Here, if you want to show them.

162
00:06:06.538 --> 00:06:08.345
LAURA: Yeah, there it is. Okay, yeah.

163
00:06:08.345 --> 00:06:10.612
♪ Da da da dun ♪

164
00:06:10.612 --> 00:06:13.347
♪ It's in the store now ♪

165
00:06:13.347 --> 00:06:14.797
Go look at it.

166
00:06:15.911 --> 00:06:18.013
This was by Brian Weiss.

167
00:06:18.013 --> 00:06:19.332
He's amazing.

168
00:06:19.332 --> 00:06:22.415
And just a little, you know...

169
00:06:22.415 --> 00:06:23.814
note.

170
00:06:23.814 --> 00:06:27.724
If you're buying items for Christmas or the holidays,

171
00:06:27.724 --> 00:06:30.832
the cutoff date, if you get regular shipping,

172
00:06:30.832 --> 00:06:34.530
is December 8th, and then if you do expedited shipping,

173
00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:35.902
you can go all the way to December 15th.

174
00:06:35.902 --> 00:06:37.765
Just letting you guys know that if you want to buy them

175
00:06:37.765 --> 00:06:39.383
for gifts, and you're like oh no!

176
00:06:39.383 --> 00:06:40.359
So there you go.

177
00:06:40.359 --> 00:06:41.609
MATT: Perfect.
TRAVIS: Do it now!

178
00:06:41.609 --> 00:06:43.786
Thank you, Laura.

179
00:06:43.786 --> 00:06:45.356
Thus-- that's mine.

180
00:06:45.356 --> 00:06:48.359
LIAM: Oh, I have the minorest of things,
just friend of the show

181
00:06:48.359 --> 00:06:51.872
Joe Mad, comic book legend
and running the company

182
00:06:51.872 --> 00:06:55.310
Airship Syndicate Games, they have a new game out today,

183
00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.877
Darksiders Genesis. I've been working on Darksiders

184
00:06:57.877 --> 00:07:01.139
for a long time. I remember walking into the studio

185
00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:04.510
and working on some mystery game, and Joe Mad-- oh, alarm.

186
00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:06.230
Joe Mad was in the room.

187
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:09.995
Anyway, the game's out today, the horsemen are riding again.

188
00:07:11.187 --> 00:07:13.286
That's it, Joe's just a friend and they make good shit,

189
00:07:13.286 --> 00:07:14.119

LAURA: Thank you, Joe Mad.
MATT: Thank you, Joe.

192
00:07:17.778 --> 00:07:19.760

MATT: And welcome back.

235
00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:07.381
So.

236
00:09:07.381 --> 00:09:09.282
LIAM: Knocked the words out of my mouth.
TALIESIN: Well done.

237
00:09:09.282 --> 00:09:11.059
MATT: Last we left off, children.

238
00:09:11.059 --> 00:09:12.692
(laughter and sighing)

239
00:09:12.692 --> 00:09:16.173
I know it's been two weeks, but I need your attention.

240
00:09:16.173 --> 00:09:19.401
Last we left off, the Mighty Nein,

241
00:09:19.401 --> 00:09:20.742
having sought the answers behind

242
00:09:20.742 --> 00:09:22.997
the cult of the Angel of Irons,

243
00:09:22.997 --> 00:09:27.577
uncovered secretly, the angel does not exist,

244
00:09:27.577 --> 00:09:31.696
and the cult is actually essentially catfishing its members.

245
00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:33.101
LIAM and MARISHA: Swordfish.

246
00:09:33.101 --> 00:09:38.101
MATT: To the benefit of Tharizdun, the Chained Oblivion,

247
00:09:38.764 --> 00:09:42.056
one of the most dangerous, mad, hungry gods

248
00:09:42.056 --> 00:09:44.485
of the Betrayer Gods.

249
00:09:44.485 --> 00:09:48.134
Gathering allies, you found that they were getting close

250
00:09:48.134 --> 00:09:50.844
to the final phase of their plan, and were making their way

251
00:09:50.844 --> 00:09:54.239
towards Rexxentrum, the capital of the Dwendalian Empire.

252
00:09:54.239 --> 00:09:58.030
With the aid of Pumat Sol, you made your way there,

253
00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:00.677
did a call for friends, put some word out

254
00:10:00.677 --> 00:10:04.035
to the Cobalt Soul, but at that time it seemed

255
00:10:04.035 --> 00:10:07.658
the Kryn Dynasty was assaulting the capital

256
00:10:07.658 --> 00:10:11.698
via purple worm burrowing assassins and warriors.

257
00:10:11.698 --> 00:10:13.906
In the sense of this chaos, you made your way

258
00:10:13.906 --> 00:10:16.433
through the rain to the Chantry of the Dawnfather,

259
00:10:16.433 --> 00:10:18.586
where it seemed one of the shackles

260
00:10:18.586 --> 00:10:22.471
that holds the Chained Oblivion at bay resides.

261
00:10:22.471 --> 00:10:24.938
You battled your way through the chapel,

262
00:10:24.938 --> 00:10:29.125
through the cathedral, shattered the stained glass windows,

263
00:10:29.125 --> 00:10:32.713
freed your friend Yasha from the influence of Obann,

264
00:10:32.713 --> 00:10:36.821
and sent him as well as the remainder of his trio below,

265
00:10:36.821 --> 00:10:40.365
but not before destroying the now-weakened Laughing Hand.

266
00:10:40.365 --> 00:10:42.915
After making your way through the mysteries

267
00:10:42.915 --> 00:10:45.192
of the subterranean basement and uncovering

268
00:10:45.192 --> 00:10:48.940
the ancient location of where this shackle was located,

269
00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:51.290
you did battle with Obann, prevented him

270
00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:56.066
from completing the ritual, and left him to die and recover

271
00:10:56.066 --> 00:10:58.595
on his side of the planes, but in the final moment

272
00:10:58.595 --> 00:11:02.017
before he could be reborn, the Chained Oblivion

273
00:11:02.017 --> 00:11:04.829
delivered its punishment for failure,

274
00:11:04.829 --> 00:11:07.572
and you watched as his body transformed

275
00:11:07.572 --> 00:11:12.161
into a horrible, roiling, pulsing black inky mess

276
00:11:12.161 --> 00:11:14.744
of eyes and teeth and tendrils.

277
00:11:15.709 --> 00:11:17.289
And that's where we left off.

278
00:11:17.289 --> 00:11:18.172
LAURA: (groans)

279
00:11:18.172 --> 00:11:22.366
MATT: So, as you all look in horror

280
00:11:22.366 --> 00:11:26.183
upon this transformed mass before you,

281
00:11:26.183 --> 00:11:27.391
I need you all to roll initiative.

282
00:11:27.391 --> 00:11:29.547
LAURA: No way. Oh god, that fucking fast?

283
00:11:29.547 --> 00:11:30.380
MATT: Yeah.

284
00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:32.071
SAM: Wait, I thought that thing was dead, it's alive?

285
00:11:32.071 --> 00:11:33.404
MATT: Yeah, no.

286
00:11:33.404 --> 00:11:35.266
This is what you're fighting now, buddy.

00:11:36.099 --> 00:11:38.276

00:11:38.276 --> 00:11:41.608
SAM: Oh no!
Toonami?

290
00:11:41.608 --> 00:11:43.002
TRAVIS: Umami.
Oh wait, what's--

291
00:11:43.002 --> 00:11:45.486

TRAVIS: That's it.

00:11:45.486 --> 00:11:46.619
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

293
00:11:46.619 --> 00:11:47.838
MATT: All righty, so, 25 to 20.

294
00:11:47.838 --> 00:11:49.962

MATT: All right.
SAM: Are we next to this thing?

301

MATT: All right.

Watching it (slurping) begin to spread out,

319
00:12:36.788 --> 00:12:38.762
its body emerging and it's lashing out,

320

you can see the light in the room itself

321
00:12:41.175 --> 00:12:42.756

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:47.085
you can move five more

355
00:13:47.085 --> 00:13:47.918
if you want to go this way,

356
00:13:47.918 --> 00:13:49.184
or if you want to stay behind this pillar.

357
00:13:49.184 --> 00:13:51.889
SAM: I'll do five, well, no,
I'll stay behind the pillar,

358
00:13:51.889 --> 00:13:55.116
just in case it does some crazy area effect thing.

359
00:13:55.116 --> 00:13:57.376
MATT: That finishes your turn, Nott.
Fjord, you're up.

360
00:13:57.376 --> 00:13:59.469
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm tapped, I have no more spells,

361
00:13:59.469 --> 00:14:01.535
or any feature abilities.

362
00:14:01.535 --> 00:14:06.325
I will take my chances and run after Nott

363
00:14:06.325 --> 00:14:09.221
out and around, same way.

364
00:14:09.221 --> 00:14:10.054
MATT: Okay.

365
00:14:10.054 --> 00:14:14.353
As you rush away, one of the inky whips (whipping)

366
00:14:14.353 --> 00:14:16.814
whips in your direction.

367
00:14:16.814 --> 00:14:18.401
12.

368
00:14:18.401 --> 00:14:19.889
TRAVIS: Oh, misses!
MATT: Yeah.

369
00:14:19.889 --> 00:14:22.331
You duck underneath and it slams into the rock behind you,

370
00:14:22.331 --> 00:14:24.711
the wall cracks, and you watch as stones

371
00:14:24.711 --> 00:14:27.088
and bits of broken chamber plummet to the ground.

372
00:14:27.088 --> 00:14:28.816
TRAVIS: That's very fortuitous.

373
00:14:28.816 --> 00:14:31.927
MATT: Five, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30.

374
00:14:31.927 --> 00:14:32.803
SAM: Fjord-tuitous?

375
00:14:32.803 --> 00:14:35.101
MATT: You can get just in front
of Nott there, if you'd like.

376
00:14:35.101 --> 00:14:38.636
TRAVIS: That sounds great, and I will
send two Eldritch Blasts

377
00:14:38.636 --> 00:14:41.986
in that thing's direction.
MATT: Go for it.

378
00:14:43.562 --> 00:14:45.149
SAM: That looks like a custom mini.

379
00:14:45.149 --> 00:14:48.837
TRAVIS: That's a 24 and a 26?

380
00:14:48.837 --> 00:14:50.295
MATT: 24 and 26 both hit.

381
00:14:50.295 --> 00:14:51.128
TRAVIS: Great.

382
00:14:53.258 --> 00:14:57.519
14 points of force damage,
and 14 points of force damage

383
00:14:57.519 --> 00:14:59.394
for 28 total.
MATT: Nice!

384
00:14:59.394 --> 00:15:01.875
As you launch both of these out

385
00:15:01.875 --> 00:15:03.551
just around the corner of the pillar.

386
00:15:03.551 --> 00:15:06.024
Both of them plunge into this darkness,

387
00:15:06.024 --> 00:15:08.503
and you see these dull green detonations

388
00:15:08.503 --> 00:15:10.917
of the eldritch energy, like depth charges

389
00:15:10.917 --> 00:15:14.001
deep in the ocean, but just swallowed by the blackness.

390
00:15:14.001 --> 00:15:15.706
It hit.
TRAVIS: Okay, great.

391
00:15:15.706 --> 00:15:17.434
MATT: All right, that finishes your turn?

392
00:15:17.434 --> 00:15:19.549
TRAVIS: It's bad, we're running! (laughter)

393
00:15:19.549 --> 00:15:22.043
MATT: All right, it is now Obann the Punished's turn.

394
00:15:22.043 --> 00:15:23.571
LAURA: Oh no, no, no, no, no.

395
00:15:23.571 --> 00:15:24.764
ASHLEY: Obann the Punished.

396
00:15:24.764 --> 00:15:27.686
MATT: It's going to do a Storm of Biting Shadow.

397
00:15:27.686 --> 00:15:29.082
TRAVIS: What the fuck is that?

398
00:15:29.082 --> 00:15:31.503
MATT: Everyone within 30 feet, which is everyone.

399
00:15:31.503 --> 00:15:34.614
SAM: Except for people behind the pillar.

400
00:15:34.614 --> 00:15:35.972
MATT: Everyone within 30 feet.

401
00:15:35.972 --> 00:15:36.989
SAM: Dammit.

402
00:15:36.989 --> 00:15:38.660
(laughter)

403
00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:40.858
MARISHA: Biting shadow.
MATT: It attacks.

404
00:15:40.858 --> 00:15:43.565
So I need to go ahead and roll damage on this first.

405
00:15:43.565 --> 00:15:45.712
SAM: I feel like we're getting swordfished.
LAURA: Oh my god.

406
00:15:45.712 --> 00:15:48.112
MATT: God dammit, Sam.

407
00:15:50.912 --> 00:15:52.717
TRAVIS: Maybe I shoulda double-dashed outta there.

408
00:15:52.717 --> 00:15:54.300
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

409
00:15:57.792 --> 00:15:58.625
MATT: So.

410
00:15:58.625 --> 00:16:00.212
ASHLEY: I mean, we're going to have to
fight him at some point.

411
00:16:00.212 --> 00:16:02.741
MATT: Fjord, that's going to be a 24.

412
00:16:02.741 --> 00:16:03.574
TRAVIS: Hits.

413
00:16:03.574 --> 00:16:07.576
MATT: You take 22 points of necrotic damage.

414
00:16:07.576 --> 00:16:08.978
TRAVIS: Oh my god.
MARISHA: Oh no.

415
00:16:08.978 --> 00:16:10.471
MATT: Beauregard.
ASHLEY: 24 points.

416
00:16:10.471 --> 00:16:13.455
MATT: Natural one, misses you entirely.

417
00:16:13.455 --> 00:16:14.615
LAURA: Oh my god.

418
00:16:14.615 --> 00:16:16.123
SAM: Oh, they have to target each one individually?

419
00:16:16.123 --> 00:16:18.268
MATT: Yeah, Caleb.

420
00:16:18.268 --> 00:16:20.101
That is going to be a 21.

421
00:16:22.072 --> 00:16:23.255
LIAM: Hits.

422
00:16:23.255 --> 00:16:26.305
MATT: Hits, all right, you take
22 points of necrotic damage.

423
00:16:26.305 --> 00:16:27.778
Caleb falls unconscious.

424
00:16:27.778 --> 00:16:31.895
TRAVIS: Oh shit, oh fuck, oh shit,
oh fuck, oh shit, oh fuck!

425
00:16:31.895 --> 00:16:34.013
(laughter)
MATT: All righty.

426
00:16:35.571 --> 00:16:36.404
Nott.

427
00:16:37.555 --> 00:16:38.731
15.

428
00:16:38.731 --> 00:16:40.156
SAM: Misses!
MATT: You duck out of the way.

429
00:16:40.156 --> 00:16:41.344
SAM: Because I'm behind that pillar!

430
00:16:41.344 --> 00:16:43.427
MATT: There, you see? Well done.

431
00:16:45.468 --> 00:16:48.633
Yeah, you would've had half-cover. You take no damage.

432
00:16:48.633 --> 00:16:49.497
SAM: Oh, great.

433
00:16:49.497 --> 00:16:51.852
MATT: But you would've had a plus two to your AC

434
00:16:51.852 --> 00:16:53.863
because you had half cover from behind the pillar.

435
00:16:53.863 --> 00:16:54.696
Jester.

436
00:16:56.681 --> 00:16:58.007
14.
SAM: Whoa!

437
00:16:58.007 --> 00:16:59.849
MATT: Rolling really shitty on this.

438
00:16:59.849 --> 00:17:01.628
Like three, two, one.

439
00:17:01.628 --> 00:17:04.468
Caduceus. (laughs)

440
00:17:04.468 --> 00:17:06.050
29.
SAM: Oh!

441
00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:07.119
TALIESIN: Misses.
(laughter)

442
00:17:07.119 --> 00:17:08.767
MATT: You take 22 points of necrotic damage.

443
00:17:08.767 --> 00:17:10.824
TALIESIN: That's fair.
MATT: And Yasha.

444
00:17:11.666 --> 00:17:12.734
Natural one.

445
00:17:12.734 --> 00:17:14.474
SAM and TRAVIS: Wow!

446
00:17:14.474 --> 00:17:16.718
ASHLEY: He's very scared of me.

447
00:17:16.718 --> 00:17:19.916
MATT: So everyone who was hit, which should be Fjord,

448
00:17:19.916 --> 00:17:24.292
Caleb technically, Caduceus, you are weakened

449
00:17:24.292 --> 00:17:26.125
until the end of his next turn,

450
00:17:26.125 --> 00:17:30.030
which means all damage you deal with weapons is halved.

451
00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:30.863
SAM: (gasps)

452
00:17:30.863 --> 00:17:31.696
TRAVIS: With weapons.
MATT: Yeah.

453
00:17:31.696 --> 00:17:32.574
TRAVIS: Okay.
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.

454
00:17:32.574 --> 00:17:33.823
TRAVIS: Spells too, or just weapons?

455
00:17:33.823 --> 00:17:35.073
MATT: Just weapons.
TALIESIN: Okay.

456
00:17:35.073 --> 00:17:38.940
MATT: He's then going to attempt to move this way.

457
00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:39.815
LAURA: Oh god.

458
00:17:39.815 --> 00:17:42.789
MATT: Around, which means both Yasha and Beauregard

459
00:17:42.789 --> 00:17:44.427
get attacks of opportunity.

460
00:17:44.427 --> 00:17:46.600
MARISHA: Sentinel babes!
ASHLEY: Sentinel bitches!

461
00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.097
TRAVIS: (laughs and claps)

462
00:17:48.097 --> 00:17:49.472
MATT: Actually--
ASHLEY: Sentinel bitches!

463
00:17:49.472 --> 00:17:51.956
MATT: Yeah, it's attacks of opportunity,
so yes, you do still get it.

464
00:17:51.956 --> 00:17:53.928
Because Sentinel does cancel out

465
00:17:53.928 --> 00:17:56.800
if it's for one attacking the other,
but you do still get--

466
00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:58.497
MARISHA: 27.
MATT: 27 hits.

467
00:17:58.497 --> 00:18:03.138
ASHLEY: I rolled a 19, so that would be...

468
00:18:06.254 --> 00:18:08.809
I still have Skingorger, 27.

469
00:18:08.809 --> 00:18:10.347
MATT: 27, that hits.

470
00:18:10.347 --> 00:18:12.225
MARISHA: 12 damage.
MATT: 12 damage, all right.

471
00:18:12.225 --> 00:18:13.760
MARISHA: And that bitch ain't moving.

472
00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:14.708
MATT: Nope.

473
00:18:14.708 --> 00:18:16.996
ASHLEY: Wait a minute, and it's a 19, so that's a critical,

474
00:18:16.996 --> 00:18:19.369
with the Skingorger.
MATT: Correct.

475
00:18:19.369 --> 00:18:20.790
TRAVIS: Let's go.

476
00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:22.282
Let's go!

477
00:18:22.282 --> 00:18:25.000
LIAM: Guys, it's two weeks later
and Ashley is still here.

478
00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.526
ASHLEY: I know, this is weird.
TRAVIS: Are you still raging?

479
00:18:27.526 --> 00:18:29.149
ASHLEY: I mean, I was.

480
00:18:29.149 --> 00:18:30.870
MATT: This encounter happened,
like it was like a brief pause

481
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:32.806
as it transformed, and then--

482
00:18:32.806 --> 00:18:35.069
ASHLEY: So would you still--
MATT: I'd say you're still, yeah.

483
00:18:35.069 --> 00:18:37.203
TRAVIS: Let's go, do the critical.

484
00:18:37.203 --> 00:18:38.766
TRAVIS, SAM, and MARISHA: Brutar criticar.

485
00:18:38.766 --> 00:18:41.158
ASHLEY: Go for it.
MARISHA: I already did mine.

486
00:18:41.158 --> 00:18:43.075
ASHLEY: Oh, oh.
MARISHA: Yeah, you're good.

487
00:18:43.075 --> 00:18:45.167
12 damage from Beau.

488
00:18:45.167 --> 00:18:46.125
ASHLEY: Okay.
TRAVIS: We got you.

489
00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:48.124
ASHLEY: Where's my fucking things?

490
00:18:48.124 --> 00:18:49.817
TALIESIN: I was about to say, do people still have Bless,

491
00:18:49.817 --> 00:18:53.062
or do we, Bless is still up, isn't it?

492
00:18:53.062 --> 00:18:53.895
LAURA: I think.

493
00:18:56.547 --> 00:18:57.704
MATT: Bless would still be up.

494
00:18:57.704 --> 00:18:59.855
Although, you took damage, so I need you to roll

495
00:18:59.855 --> 00:19:00.688
a concentration check.

496
00:19:00.688 --> 00:19:02.666
TALIESIN: Oh, concentration check, that's fine.

497
00:19:04.249 --> 00:19:06.068
MATT: You have to beat an 11 on the DC.

498
00:19:06.068 --> 00:19:07.186
TALIESIN: 10.

499
00:19:07.186 --> 00:19:08.792
MATT: Bless fades. Who'd you have it cast on?

500
00:19:08.792 --> 00:19:10.138
TRAVIS: Fjord.

501
00:19:10.138 --> 00:19:12.502
LAURA: No, I had--
TALIESIN: Who did you have?

502
00:19:12.502 --> 00:19:15.265
MATT: It's been a couple weeks.

503
00:19:15.265 --> 00:19:16.647
TALIESIN: I had four people.

504
00:19:16.647 --> 00:19:18.038
LAURA: Chatroom!

505
00:19:18.038 --> 00:19:19.479
MATT: Oh, you had four people?

506
00:19:19.479 --> 00:19:21.547
You sure it wasn't three and three?

507
00:19:21.547 --> 00:19:23.726
TALIESIN: No, it was three and four.
LAURA: It was?

508
00:19:23.726 --> 00:19:25.860
TALIESIN: Yeah, because I cast it
at second level for four people.

509
00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:28.202
SAM: I was not blessed, because I wasn't in the room.

510
00:19:28.202 --> 00:19:29.035
MATT: Nott was not blessed.
TALIESIN: Oh.

511
00:19:29.035 --> 00:19:32.283
LAURA: Yes you were in the room, you were blessed.

512
00:19:32.283 --> 00:19:33.393
MATT: Well.
TALIESIN: All right.

513
00:19:33.393 --> 00:19:35.925
MATT: If you can't remember, then I'm going to roll.

514
00:19:35.925 --> 00:19:38.667
LAURA: Yes you were, dude.
TALIESIN: Yeah, you were.

515
00:19:38.667 --> 00:19:40.485
MATT: Okay, so Fjord loses Bless.

516
00:19:40.485 --> 00:19:42.960
MARISHA: I feel like I might have been Cad.

517
00:19:45.924 --> 00:19:48.692
SAM: CritRoleStats.
MATT: Caleb keeps it.

518
00:19:48.692 --> 00:19:51.296
Beauregard loses Bless.

519
00:19:51.296 --> 00:19:52.796
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's fair.

520
00:19:54.629 --> 00:19:56.597
I'll make a note next time.

521
00:19:57.647 --> 00:19:58.480
MATT: Yasha loses Bless.
TALIESIN: Didn't occur to me that I would

522
00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:59.313
have this Bless.
LAURA: I know.

523
00:19:59.313 --> 00:20:00.930
(laughs) Yeah, I know, right?

524
00:20:02.672 --> 00:20:04.788
MATT: So we'll say that there.
TALIESIN: All right.

525
00:20:04.788 --> 00:20:06.409
I know, because I still have my first levels

526
00:20:06.409 --> 00:20:08.441
but not my second, so I burned a second Bless,

527
00:20:08.441 --> 00:20:10.119
which means four.
MATT: Okay.

528
00:20:10.119 --> 00:20:14.702
SAM: I feel Nott, Fjord, and Caleb were blessed by Jester.

529
00:20:15.621 --> 00:20:17.250
It's just a feeling I get.

530
00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:18.406
LAURA: Oh yeah?

531
00:20:18.406 --> 00:20:20.077
Nott, Fjord, and Caleb, okay.

532
00:20:20.077 --> 00:20:25.077
ASHLEY: So 13 was the total dice roll, plus four.

533
00:20:25.414 --> 00:20:27.801
SAM: It's a feeling I got.

534
00:20:27.801 --> 00:20:29.518
MATT: It's a feeling you got?

535
00:20:29.518 --> 00:20:30.351
SAM: Yeah.

536
00:20:30.351 --> 00:20:32.504
LAURA: It was Nott, Fjord, and Caleb.
MATT: Nott, Fjord, and Caleb?

537
00:20:32.504 --> 00:20:34.221
LAURA: Is who I had blessed, so those are still up.

538
00:20:34.221 --> 00:20:35.427
ASHLEY: 30 damage.
MATT: Gotcha.

539
00:20:35.427 --> 00:20:37.045
Well there you go, thank you for the follow-up on that.

540
00:20:37.045 --> 00:20:38.133
30 damage, you said?
ASHLEY: 30 damage.

541
00:20:38.133 --> 00:20:39.416
MATT: Whew, nice.

542
00:20:41.493 --> 00:20:44.243
Checking one thing about...

543
00:20:45.523 --> 00:20:47.467
LAURA: I don't know.

544
00:20:47.467 --> 00:20:48.713
MATT: All right, good to know.

545
00:20:48.713 --> 00:20:52.483
All righty, so, that means, so Caleb loses it?

546
00:20:52.483 --> 00:20:54.681
LAURA: Well, it's because he's unconscious.

547
00:20:54.681 --> 00:20:55.973
I had him, but.

548
00:20:55.973 --> 00:20:59.516
MATT: Okay, the spell's still on him, technically I guess.

549
00:20:59.516 --> 00:21:01.669
LAURA: Technically.

550
00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:03.893
MATT: So Fjord keeps it, Nott keeps it?

551
00:21:03.893 --> 00:21:05.840
LAURA: And Nott.
MATT: Gotcha.

552
00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:07.876
So then you lose it.
LAURA: Yes.

553
00:21:07.876 --> 00:21:09.441
ASHLEY: 34!

554
00:21:09.441 --> 00:21:10.816
MATT: 34, all right.

555
00:21:10.816 --> 00:21:13.108
ASHLEY: Forgot to add the extra.
SAM: Whoa, points of damage?

556
00:21:13.108 --> 00:21:14.133
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah.

557
00:21:14.133 --> 00:21:16.041
TRAVIS: And you rolled a brutal critical?

558
00:21:16.041 --> 00:21:18.084
Extra damage die?
ASHLEY: Yeah.

559
00:21:18.084 --> 00:21:19.842
TRAVIS: Yep. Dope, dope.
MATT: All righty.

560
00:21:21.703 --> 00:21:23.946
ASHLEY: It's an extra d6?
MATT: Cool.

561
00:21:23.946 --> 00:21:25.607
Yeah, on your first hit.

562
00:21:25.607 --> 00:21:27.258
Wait, is that on your turn?

563
00:21:27.258 --> 00:21:28.091
ASHLEY: No.

564
00:21:29.119 --> 00:21:30.668
It was a reaction.

565
00:21:30.668 --> 00:21:32.586
MATT: Right, so double-check and see if you do the extra d6.

566
00:21:32.586 --> 00:21:33.419
ASHLEY: Okay, let's see.

567
00:21:33.419 --> 00:21:35.893
MATT: I think we already--
SAM: Yeah, I actually didn't.

568
00:21:35.893 --> 00:21:38.478
MATT: Might be on your turn. Anyway.

569
00:21:38.478 --> 00:21:42.009
That-- Obann cannot move for the rest of your turn,

570
00:21:42.009 --> 00:21:44.928
so he has zero speed for this. That finishes Obann's turn.

571
00:21:44.928 --> 00:21:46.994
It's now the Caedogeist's turn.

572
00:21:46.994 --> 00:21:49.407
LAURA: Please, please, please attack the--

573
00:21:49.407 --> 00:21:51.211
MATT: The Caedogeist is going to turn, see this scenario,

574
00:21:51.211 --> 00:21:53.232
see you guys in trouble, and it's going to go ahead

575
00:21:53.232 --> 00:21:54.624
and run this way up the stairs.

576
00:21:54.624 --> 00:21:57.227
LAURA: Okay, well, better than--

577
00:21:57.227 --> 00:21:59.472
TALIESIN: That could have been worse.
MARISHA: Yeah.

578
00:21:59.472 --> 00:22:00.676
LAURA: I mean, she has to be super pissed.

579
00:22:00.676 --> 00:22:02.806
She was under his control, too, you know?

580
00:22:02.806 --> 00:22:05.792
TALIESIN: As-- is she, as she runs by?
MATT: Yeah?

581
00:22:05.792 --> 00:22:08.921
TALIESIN: I'm just going to yell out: aw come on, really?

582
00:22:08.921 --> 00:22:10.254
Not going to-- okay.

583
00:22:11.154 --> 00:22:12.647
MATT: Roll a Persuasion check with disadvantage.

584
00:22:12.647 --> 00:22:13.533
TALIESIN: Fair.

585
00:22:13.533 --> 00:22:15.094
ASHLEY: (laughs)

586
00:22:15.094 --> 00:22:15.927
TALIESIN: Oh man.

587
00:22:17.099 --> 00:22:18.718
LAURA: Oh.

588
00:22:18.718 --> 00:22:19.851
TALIESIN: That's a...

589
00:22:20.801 --> 00:22:21.634
six.

590
00:22:21.634 --> 00:22:22.758
MATT: All right.
(laughter)

591
00:22:22.758 --> 00:22:24.474
The Caedogeist doesn't even look at you.

592
00:22:24.474 --> 00:22:26.130
She just flips you off.

593
00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:30.420
Like glides by and begins to merge into the stairs up here.

594
00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:31.253
TALIESIN: Rude.

595
00:22:31.253 --> 00:22:32.137
MATT: All right.

596
00:22:32.137 --> 00:22:33.887
Beau, you're up next.

597
00:22:35.177 --> 00:22:38.352
MARISHA: Pop, pop, his pustules.

598
00:22:39.251 --> 00:22:41.270
LAURA: Ew, your hands are going to sink into it.

599
00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:42.291
MARISHA: Yeah, super gross.

600
00:22:42.291 --> 00:22:46.014
I'm going to try and avoid
places where there are mouths.

601
00:22:46.014 --> 00:22:48.687
MATT: Good luck. (laughter)

602
00:22:48.687 --> 00:22:50.012
SAM: That's just good life advice.

603
00:22:50.012 --> 00:22:51.927
MARISHA: I don't have advantage, do I?

604
00:22:51.927 --> 00:22:53.010
First attack.

605
00:22:54.014 --> 00:22:54.924
17?

606
00:22:54.924 --> 00:22:56.382
MATT: 17 hits.

607
00:22:56.382 --> 00:22:58.231
MARISHA: Ooh, that's good, okay.

608
00:22:58.231 --> 00:22:59.546
ASHLEY: It's a large mass of tentacles.

609
00:22:59.546 --> 00:23:02.796
It's not difficult to hit, necessarily.

610
00:23:04.011 --> 00:23:05.100
MARISHA: 10 damage?

611
00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:05.951
MATT: 10 damage, all right.

612
00:23:05.951 --> 00:23:07.626
MARISHA: Second attack.

613
00:23:07.626 --> 00:23:09.559
25 to hit...

614
00:23:09.559 --> 00:23:11.093
and 11 damage.

615
00:23:11.093 --> 00:23:12.617
MATT: Got it.

616
00:23:12.617 --> 00:23:13.931
All right, bonus action?

617
00:23:13.931 --> 00:23:15.431
MARISHA: And then I am...

618
00:23:19.149 --> 00:23:21.886
I'm just going to bonus action attack.

619
00:23:21.886 --> 00:23:22.920
SAM: Watch out for those mouths.

620
00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:23.826
MARISHA: 26.

621
00:23:23.826 --> 00:23:25.107
I mean, sorry, 16.

622
00:23:25.107 --> 00:23:25.940
MATT: 16 hits.

623
00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:27.538
MARISHA: Oh, wow.

624
00:23:27.538 --> 00:23:28.750
Nine damage.

625
00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:31.555
MATT: Okay, all right, so as you-- each punch,

626
00:23:31.555 --> 00:23:34.805
it's like punching the side of a

627
00:23:34.805 --> 00:23:37.596
cold, wet, sea creature.

628
00:23:37.596 --> 00:23:39.483
Like it like impacts and blubbers a bit,

629
00:23:39.483 --> 00:23:41.330
but then your hand sinks like tar,

630
00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:42.945
and you have to pull back, and as you do,

631
00:23:42.945 --> 00:23:45.806
you feel teeth that had since gone around your fist

632
00:23:45.806 --> 00:23:48.387
scrape away, and it digs into the skin a bit.

633
00:23:48.387 --> 00:23:49.724
Not enough to damage you, but you're like

634
00:23:49.724 --> 00:23:50.978
whoa, this is horrible!

635
00:23:50.978 --> 00:23:52.681
TRAVIS: (laughs)
MATT: It's terrible!

636
00:23:52.681 --> 00:23:55.217
MARISHA: Whoa, this turned me into
a '90s cartoon character!

637
00:23:55.217 --> 00:23:56.844
MATT: Yeah, you know, "Whoa!

638
00:23:56.844 --> 00:23:58.342
"Don't forget to recycle!"

639
00:23:58.342 --> 00:24:00.535
TRAVIS: Oh, wow.
(laughter)

640
00:24:00.535 --> 00:24:03.722
MATT: And then as you pull back, the teeth close

641
00:24:03.722 --> 00:24:05.529
and pull open and an eye pops out.

642
00:24:05.529 --> 00:24:08.053
(groaning)

643
00:24:08.053 --> 00:24:09.403
MATT: That's your action and your bonus.

644
00:24:09.403 --> 00:24:10.306
You still have your movement.

645
00:24:10.306 --> 00:24:12.837
TRAVIS: Holy shit. (laughter)

646
00:24:12.837 --> 00:24:14.778
MARISHA: My movement.

647
00:24:14.778 --> 00:24:16.511
MATT: Or you can stay put, your call.
SAM: Ooh!

648
00:24:16.511 --> 00:24:18.211
LAURA: (laughs)

649
00:24:18.211 --> 00:24:20.092
LIAM: Just Riegel's face popping up.

650
00:24:20.092 --> 00:24:21.922
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, you know what,

651
00:24:21.922 --> 00:24:23.790
I'll back up, I'll back up.

652
00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:26.898
I'll head towards the door, towards Cad.

653
00:24:28.487 --> 00:24:31.174
SAM: Did she get any, does he swipe at her or anything.

654
00:24:31.174 --> 00:24:32.140
MATT: It's already used its reaction.

655
00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:33.508
SAM: Yeah!

656
00:24:33.508 --> 00:24:35.517
MATT: Are you going all the way up to Caduceus,
or are you going further in?

657
00:24:35.517 --> 00:24:36.439
MARISHA: No, that's good, that's good.

658
00:24:36.439 --> 00:24:38.176
MATT: All right, cool.

659
00:24:38.176 --> 00:24:40.249
Caleb, you're on the ground, I want you to go ahead

660
00:24:40.249 --> 00:24:41.947
and make a death saving throw for me.

661
00:24:41.947 --> 00:24:43.904
LIAM: Does blessing affect this?

662
00:24:43.904 --> 00:24:47.292
MATT: Blessing would give you an extra d4, technically?

663
00:24:47.292 --> 00:24:48.598
Because it is a saving throw.

664
00:24:48.598 --> 00:24:50.535
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MARISHA: I think it does.

665
00:24:50.535 --> 00:24:53.004
LIAM: Well, that ain't going to help, that's a fail.

666
00:24:53.004 --> 00:24:55.921
MATT: All right, first death save failed for Caleb.

667
00:24:57.695 --> 00:24:58.528
All right.

668
00:24:59.417 --> 00:25:00.300
Caduceus, your turn.

669
00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:01.615
TALIESIN: I'm going to walk up to Caleb.

670
00:25:01.615 --> 00:25:03.860
MATT: Walk up to him?
SAM: Well there you go.

671
00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:06.859
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Cure Wounds at level three.

672
00:25:06.859 --> 00:25:09.232
SAM: Two clerics.
TALIESIN: So you get 29 hit points.

673
00:25:09.232 --> 00:25:10.725
MATT: Oh, right.
SAM: Oh!

674
00:25:10.725 --> 00:25:12.801
MATT: Grave clerics, man.

675
00:25:12.801 --> 00:25:14.461
TALIESIN: Not today, motherfucker!

676
00:25:14.461 --> 00:25:16.144
(laughter)

677
00:25:16.144 --> 00:25:17.779
SAM: Yarr.
LAURA: Yarr.

678
00:25:17.779 --> 00:25:20.713
TALIESIN: If you're unconscious, I don't have to roll,

679
00:25:20.713 --> 00:25:22.245
I just do max healing.

680
00:25:22.245 --> 00:25:23.622
ASHLEY: Oh, that's so cool.

681
00:25:23.622 --> 00:25:24.774
TALIESIN: It's pretty cool.

682
00:25:24.774 --> 00:25:27.691
TRAVIS: You are the ultimate defibrillator.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

683
00:25:27.691 --> 00:25:28.914
Pop pop.

684
00:25:28.914 --> 00:25:30.331
Ain't done today.

685
00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:35.917
And I'm going to use the rest of my movement--

686
00:25:35.917 --> 00:25:37.690
I can't really-- my bonus actions all suck.

687
00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:39.171
MATT: Yeah, you moved 10 feet, so.

688
00:25:39.171 --> 00:25:41.617
TALIESIN: So.
MATT: You have 20 feet left.

689
00:25:41.617 --> 00:25:43.578
TALIESIN: For my-- I don't really have much that I can do

690
00:25:43.578 --> 00:25:46.104
with my bonus action, so instead I'm going to

691
00:25:46.104 --> 00:25:49.628
use the rest of my movement pulling Caleb

692
00:25:49.628 --> 00:25:52.165
further away from this thing.

693
00:25:52.165 --> 00:25:54.171
Or can I help Caleb up?

694
00:25:54.171 --> 00:25:55.156
Or no?

695
00:25:55.156 --> 00:25:56.687
MATT: I'd say no.

696
00:25:56.687 --> 00:25:58.788
You've gone to the process of--

697
00:25:58.788 --> 00:26:00.449
TALIESIN: Can I take a bonus action
and the rest of my movement

698
00:26:00.449 --> 00:26:02.358
to pull him like 10 feet away?

699
00:26:02.358 --> 00:26:04.399
MATT: Eh, I'll allow it.
TALIESIN: All right.

700
00:26:04.399 --> 00:26:06.070
MATT: I'll say you can move him five feet away.

701
00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:08.644
That's as far as you can get.
TALIESIN: That'll do.

702
00:26:08.644 --> 00:26:11.750
MATT: All right, so with the remainder
of your bonus action and movement.

703
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:12.797
Okay.

704
00:26:12.797 --> 00:26:15.206
That finishes Caduceus's go. Yasha, you're up.

705
00:26:15.206 --> 00:26:17.961
Actually, before that, at the end of your turn, Caduceus,

706
00:26:17.961 --> 00:26:20.146
he's going to go ahead and use a legendary action.

707
00:26:20.146 --> 00:26:20.979
TALIESIN: Okay.

708
00:26:22.995 --> 00:26:25.499
MATT: To do an inky whip against Jester.

709
00:26:25.499 --> 00:26:27.103
LAURA: No.

710
00:26:27.103 --> 00:26:28.652
MARISHA: It's cute sounding, though.
SAM: It is.

711
00:26:28.652 --> 00:26:30.282
MATT: That is going to be a 19?

712
00:26:30.282 --> 00:26:32.859
LAURA: That's my armor class.
MATT: That hits you, then.

713
00:26:32.859 --> 00:26:33.959
LAURA: Oh, wait.

714
00:26:33.959 --> 00:26:36.974
Oh, wait, yes, I added my shield already to it.

715
00:26:36.974 --> 00:26:39.131
TRAVIS: Do you have a Bless on you?

716
00:26:39.131 --> 00:26:40.464
LAURA: No.

717
00:26:40.464 --> 00:26:43.418
MATT: So that's 12 plus six, you take 18 points

718
00:26:43.418 --> 00:26:45.146
of necrotic damage.

719
00:26:45.146 --> 00:26:46.896
SAM: Mm-hmm, and?
LAURA: Okay.

720
00:26:48.123 --> 00:26:50.674
MATT: And it pulls you 10 feet to a space adjacent to it,

721
00:26:50.674 --> 00:26:52.633
but you're already adjacent to it, so not a big deal.

722
00:26:52.633 --> 00:26:53.466
LAURA: Okay.

723
00:26:53.466 --> 00:26:55.528
TRAVIS: Is that Darkness spell still up?

724
00:26:55.528 --> 00:26:57.655
MATT: The Darkness spell is currently still up, yeah.

725
00:26:57.655 --> 00:26:58.917
TRAVIS: Gotcha.

726
00:26:58.917 --> 00:27:00.804
MATT: Because that was cast by the Caedogeist.

727
00:27:00.804 --> 00:27:02.455
TRAVIS: Right.

728
00:27:02.455 --> 00:27:04.831
MATT: All right, that finishes that legendary action.

729
00:27:04.831 --> 00:27:07.143
So, Yasha, it's your turn.

730
00:27:07.143 --> 00:27:08.443
ASHLEY: Okay.

731
00:27:08.443 --> 00:27:11.051
So, I am going to use,

732
00:27:11.926 --> 00:27:13.751
as a bonus action,

733
00:27:13.751 --> 00:27:18.009
my zealous presence, which unleashes a battle cry

734
00:27:18.009 --> 00:27:22.576
and gives 10 creatures around me of my choice

735
00:27:23.542 --> 00:27:26.267
advantages on attack rolls and saving throws.

736
00:27:26.267 --> 00:27:28.207
TRAVIS: Say what?!
MATT: Oh shit.

737
00:27:28.207 --> 00:27:30.516
For the next turn?

738
00:27:30.516 --> 00:27:32.236
ASHLEY: Attack rolls and saving throws

739
00:27:32.236 --> 00:27:33.499
until the start of your next turn.

740
00:27:33.499 --> 00:27:35.876
MATT: Okay, that's awesome.
LAURA: Cool.

741
00:27:35.876 --> 00:27:39.799
ASHLEY: Okay, and then I will attack.

742
00:27:39.799 --> 00:27:41.954
I'm going to keep attacking him, because I'm--

743
00:27:41.954 --> 00:27:44.915
MATT: Go for it.
ASHLEY: Very, very angry with him.

744
00:27:44.915 --> 00:27:46.923
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

745
00:27:46.923 --> 00:27:48.639
ASHLEY: Oh, yes!

746
00:27:48.639 --> 00:27:50.122
I rolled a 19 again.

747
00:27:50.122 --> 00:27:51.929
(cheering)

748
00:27:51.929 --> 00:27:52.762
Okay.

749
00:27:54.275 --> 00:27:55.889
LAURA: That's what happens when you're angry.

750
00:27:55.889 --> 00:27:56.722
ASHLEY: Yeah.

751
00:27:56.722 --> 00:27:58.322
LAURA: You're really raging.
Are you really raging?

752
00:27:58.322 --> 00:28:00.089
ASHLEY: I'm really raging. Okay, so--

753
00:28:00.089 --> 00:28:01.747
MATT: Just to check something real fast.

754
00:28:01.747 --> 00:28:03.464
ASHLEY: Yes.
MATT: Looking at the weapon.

755
00:28:03.464 --> 00:28:06.044
It's the 19, 20 critical I think is when

756
00:28:06.044 --> 00:28:08.311
it's engaged its ability.

757
00:28:08.311 --> 00:28:10.270
How long does that ability last for?

758
00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:14.745
ASHLEY: (reading quickly)

759
00:28:16.234 --> 00:28:18.254
Ah, okay, so "while attuned to this greatsword,

760
00:28:18.254 --> 00:28:19.925
"you can use your bonus action

761
00:28:19.925 --> 00:28:22.920
"and take a point of exhaustion to empower this blade.

762
00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:26.077
"For one minute, all attacks with this greatsword

763
00:28:26.077 --> 00:28:28.508
"do an additional 1d8 acid damage,

764
00:28:28.508 --> 00:28:31.301
"and it critically hits on a roll of 19 or 20."

765
00:28:31.301 --> 00:28:33.950
MATT: Right, so--
ASHLEY: Okay, so it's just--

766
00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:36.971
MATT: So, ignoring the fact that that was probably going

767
00:28:36.971 --> 00:28:39.991
for the previous battles, the extra damage

768
00:28:39.991 --> 00:28:41.874
would've probably balanced out, it's fine.

769
00:28:41.874 --> 00:28:43.592
But just going forward, we'll say it's just regular,

770
00:28:43.592 --> 00:28:44.893
a 20 is critical.
ASHLEY: Okay.

771
00:28:44.893 --> 00:28:46.236
MATT: So you hit still, but you don't get a critical.

772
00:28:46.236 --> 00:28:48.392
ASHLEY: So 27, yeah, so that hits.

773
00:28:48.392 --> 00:28:50.659
MATT: We'll just call that a wash.

774
00:28:50.659 --> 00:28:53.576
ASHLEY: I apologize.
MATT: It's all good.

775
00:28:53.576 --> 00:28:57.076
ASHLEY: Okay, so plus divine fury, so...

776
00:28:58.557 --> 00:29:00.765
SAM: ♪ Bum bum, bum bum bum ♪

777
00:29:00.765 --> 00:29:03.547
♪ Bum bum bum bum ♪

778
00:29:03.547 --> 00:29:05.321
ASHLEY: 17 for the first hit.

779
00:29:05.321 --> 00:29:06.872
MATT: 17, all righty.

780
00:29:06.872 --> 00:29:08.686
ASHLEY: And I will take my second attack.

781
00:29:08.686 --> 00:29:11.391
SAM: What if we don't kill Obann?

782
00:29:11.391 --> 00:29:13.641
Will it like, reform again?

783
00:29:14.487 --> 00:29:15.935
LAURA: I don't know.
TALIESIN: We don't know anything.

784
00:29:15.935 --> 00:29:18.235
ASHLEY: 11 for the second hit.
MATT: 11 for the second hit.

785
00:29:18.235 --> 00:29:21.578
LAURA: He might have to live out his entire
rest of his existence as like a blob.

786
00:29:21.578 --> 00:29:23.317
MATT: Carve through twice with the blade.

787
00:29:23.317 --> 00:29:25.275
As it tears through, you watch sections of it

788
00:29:25.275 --> 00:29:27.660
fall to the ground and then just dissolve

789
00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:30.050
into a black oil-like liquid.

790
00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:31.880
MARISHA: Death Becomes Her, you know?

791
00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:34.572
MATT: That's your action and bonus action.

792
00:29:34.572 --> 00:29:37.048
If you want to take your movement, you can.

793
00:29:37.048 --> 00:29:38.765
ASHLEY: I'm going to...

794
00:29:41.158 --> 00:29:42.677
I'm going to stay.
MATT: You're going to stay?

795
00:29:42.677 --> 00:29:44.234
SAM: Whoa.
MATT: Okay.

796
00:29:44.234 --> 00:29:46.387
SAM: Yasha is mad as hell.
LAURA: Yasha!

797
00:29:46.387 --> 00:29:47.588
ASHLEY: I'm so mad.

798
00:29:47.588 --> 00:29:49.355
MATT: That brings us to, actually, at the end of your turn,

799
00:29:49.355 --> 00:29:52.767
it's going to use another legendary action

800
00:29:52.767 --> 00:29:54.573
to use inky whip again on Jester.

801
00:29:54.573 --> 00:29:55.899
SAM: (gasps)

802
00:29:55.899 --> 00:29:57.257
TALIESIN: Get on off.

803
00:29:58.167 --> 00:29:59.292
MATT: 24 to hit.

804
00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:04.504
LAURA: Just-- I don't know why it's
attacking me and not Yasha.

805
00:30:04.504 --> 00:30:06.682
I'm not even hitting it.

806
00:30:06.682 --> 00:30:09.487
He must really dislike me.
SAM: Because you're so cute.

807
00:30:09.487 --> 00:30:11.428
MATT: 17 points of necrotic damage to you.

808
00:30:11.428 --> 00:30:12.935
LAURA: How much?
MATT: 17.

809
00:30:12.935 --> 00:30:13.768
LAURA: Okay.

810
00:30:15.277 --> 00:30:16.860
All right.
TALIESIN: I'll pick you up.

811
00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:18.014
MATT: Jester, it's your turn.

812
00:30:18.014 --> 00:30:19.833
I need you to make a concentration check, by the way.

813
00:30:19.833 --> 00:30:20.666
TALIESIN: Mm.

814
00:30:22.295 --> 00:30:23.781
LAURA: Natural 20.

815
00:30:23.781 --> 00:30:24.859
MATT: Okay.
SAM: Wow.

816
00:30:24.859 --> 00:30:26.686
MATT: Bless is maintained.

817
00:30:26.686 --> 00:30:27.852
And you technically have advantage on that

818
00:30:27.852 --> 00:30:30.416
because of your thing anyway, so.

819
00:30:31.266 --> 00:30:32.424
So what are you doing, Jester?

820
00:30:32.424 --> 00:30:33.463
LAURA: Oh man.

821
00:30:33.463 --> 00:30:34.711
MATT: (slurping)

822
00:30:34.711 --> 00:30:39.082
LAURA: Well, Yasha's not leaving, I don't know what to do.

823
00:30:39.991 --> 00:30:42.490
How are you going to get out of here?

824
00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:43.576
ASHLEY: I'll get out.

825
00:30:43.576 --> 00:30:45.038
SAM: Did you chase the Caedogeist?

826
00:30:45.038 --> 00:30:48.562
LAURA: I'm going to back up to the group.

827
00:30:48.562 --> 00:30:50.128
LIAM: -- the stairs and she vanished.

828
00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:56.593
SAM: Oh boy, oh boy.
TRAVIS: Nicely done.

829
00:30:57.439 --> 00:30:59.339
MATT: All right, it's been since Obann's turn,

830
00:30:59.339 --> 00:31:01.692
so it does get an attack of opportunity on you.

831
00:31:01.692 --> 00:31:04.427
LAURA: Oh, oh, no, it hasn't.
TALIESIN: Actually, no it hasn't been.

832
00:31:04.427 --> 00:31:06.622
LAURA: Obann went after Fjord.

833
00:31:06.622 --> 00:31:08.365
TALIESIN: He just had legendary actions.

834
00:31:08.365 --> 00:31:11.424
MATT: Went after Fjord, but then it was against Nott

835
00:31:11.424 --> 00:31:12.689
that it took its reaction.

836
00:31:12.689 --> 00:31:14.150
LAURA: And Nott hasn't gone yet again.

837
00:31:14.150 --> 00:31:15.866
MATT: Correct, but Obann went after Nott,

838
00:31:15.866 --> 00:31:17.541
so technically it would've had

839
00:31:17.541 --> 00:31:20.254
a possibility of hitting you with a reaction, but it didn't.

840
00:31:20.254 --> 00:31:23.364
On a creature's turn, it gets its reaction back.

841
00:31:23.364 --> 00:31:25.422
It spent it on Nott, who went first.

842
00:31:25.422 --> 00:31:27.139
LAURA: Oh.

843
00:31:27.139 --> 00:31:29.036
MATT: So Nott went first, used its reaction,

844
00:31:29.036 --> 00:31:30.833
then it came to Obann's turn, so it got its reaction back

845
00:31:30.833 --> 00:31:32.672
and it hasn't used it since.
TALIESIN: Oh, oh.

846
00:31:32.672 --> 00:31:33.710
LAURA: Good to know.

847
00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:36.083
MATT: But that's a 16 to hit, so it misses you anyway.

848
00:31:36.083 --> 00:31:38.057
(chuckling)
LAURA: (whistling)

849
00:31:38.057 --> 00:31:39.912
MATT: So one, two, 15--

850
00:31:39.912 --> 00:31:41.086
LAURA: You know what I'm going to do?

851
00:31:41.086 --> 00:31:42.628
Because Yasha hasn't left.
MATT: All right.

852
00:31:42.628 --> 00:31:44.794
LAURA: I'm going to back up into the inky darkness.

853
00:31:44.794 --> 00:31:45.627
MATT: Mm-hmm.

854
00:31:46.733 --> 00:31:49.065
SAM: Of the Darkness spell.
LAURA: Into the inky darkness.

855
00:31:49.065 --> 00:31:51.714
MATT: You got it, all right.

856
00:31:51.714 --> 00:31:54.348
You are currently blind inside that shadow.

857
00:31:54.348 --> 00:31:55.527
LAURA: Okay.

858
00:31:55.527 --> 00:31:59.434
I'm going to cast, I'm going to Invoke Duplicity.

859
00:31:59.434 --> 00:32:00.975
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: Ooh.

860
00:32:00.975 --> 00:32:02.238
Interesting.
MATT: Before you go in?

861
00:32:02.238 --> 00:32:04.400
LAURA: No, inside of it.

862
00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:05.255
MATT: Okay.

863
00:32:05.255 --> 00:32:06.854
Is it somewhere you can see?

864
00:32:06.854 --> 00:32:08.342
Does it say as part of the ability?

865
00:32:08.342 --> 00:32:11.359
LAURA: Well, I-- fuck me running.

866
00:32:12.961 --> 00:32:14.508
(Laura sighs)
SAM: Spells.

867
00:32:14.508 --> 00:32:16.492
LAURA: Shut up, it's not spells, it's features.

868
00:32:16.492 --> 00:32:21.135
MATT: Features.
(Travis and Matt laughing)

869
00:32:21.135 --> 00:32:24.385
LAURA: It must remain within 120 feet of me.

870
00:32:26.516 --> 00:32:28.987
I don't think, I can move it outside of where I can see,

871
00:32:28.987 --> 00:32:32.857
but I have to cast it within, let's see.

872
00:32:32.857 --> 00:32:36.798
The illusion appears within 30 feet of me.

873
00:32:36.798 --> 00:32:38.183
MATT: Appears, doesn't say "in a space you can see."

874
00:32:38.183 --> 00:32:39.653
So yeah, all right, then you can create it

875
00:32:39.653 --> 00:32:40.486
wherever you'd like--

876
00:32:40.486 --> 00:32:43.525
LAURA: I'm going to create it within the darkness as well,

877
00:32:43.525 --> 00:32:45.801
and I'm going to make it run out of the darkness

878
00:32:45.801 --> 00:32:46.700
towards the group.

879
00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:48.115
MATT: This way. All right.

880
00:32:48.115 --> 00:32:50.002
SAM: Hmm, clever girl.

881
00:32:50.002 --> 00:32:52.369
TALIESIN: Clever girl.

882
00:32:52.369 --> 00:32:53.202
MATT: Okay.

883
00:32:54.591 --> 00:32:58.046
That finishes your turn, Jester.

884
00:32:58.046 --> 00:33:00.489
At the end of Jester's turn, it's going to use

885
00:33:00.489 --> 00:33:03.739
its last legendary action to do Shadow Slip.

886
00:33:03.739 --> 00:33:04.681
SAM: What's that?

887
00:33:04.681 --> 00:33:05.826
TRAVIS: I don't think it's good.

888
00:33:05.826 --> 00:33:09.114
MATT: You watch as the light in the chamber quakes a bit

889
00:33:09.114 --> 00:33:12.516
and dims, and long shadows that are being drawn

890
00:33:12.516 --> 00:33:14.281
from the pillars around it.

891
00:33:14.281 --> 00:33:17.740
It (slurping) shifts and teleports

892
00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:19.141
over to this side of the chamber,

893
00:33:19.141 --> 00:33:22.374
causing this pillar to break and fall.

894
00:33:22.374 --> 00:33:24.258
Jester, I need you to make a dexterity saving throw,

895
00:33:24.258 --> 00:33:26.050
with disadvantage.
TALIESIN: Although you have--

896
00:33:26.050 --> 00:33:28.575
LAURA: Yasha hasn't gone again, so I have a straight roll.

897
00:33:28.575 --> 00:33:30.208
MATT: You do.

898
00:33:30.208 --> 00:33:31.805
You just hear the sound of it cracking--

899
00:33:31.805 --> 00:33:32.795
LAURA: God, this dice!

900
00:33:32.795 --> 00:33:36.273
It's gone from 20 to one to 20 to one, so I rolled a one.

901
00:33:36.273 --> 00:33:38.814
MATT: Okay, so the pillar does fall, unfortunately,

902
00:33:38.814 --> 00:33:41.906
crack down over where you are.

903
00:33:43.706 --> 00:33:46.613
You suffer seven points of bludgeoning damage,

904
00:33:46.613 --> 00:33:48.479
as it just like slams into the back

905
00:33:48.479 --> 00:33:51.028
of your shoulders and neck, you fall down to one knee.

906
00:33:51.028 --> 00:33:52.673
TALIESIN: I don't think you get an attack of opportunity.

907
00:33:52.673 --> 00:33:54.859
LAURA: I'll roll a concentration check.

908
00:33:54.859 --> 00:33:56.876
MATT: Correct, which by the way, the Blesses do fade,

909
00:33:56.876 --> 00:33:58.489
because you cannot concentrate on--

910
00:33:58.489 --> 00:34:00.603
LAURA: Oh, right, twice, you're right.

911
00:34:00.603 --> 00:34:02.209
ASHLEY: Do I get an attack of opportunity?

912
00:34:02.209 --> 00:34:03.835
MATT: You do not, because part of its movement

913
00:34:03.835 --> 00:34:05.289
is it does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

914
00:34:05.289 --> 00:34:07.652
TALIESIN: Hmm.

915
00:34:07.652 --> 00:34:09.074
(sighs)

916
00:34:09.074 --> 00:34:10.399
Okay, so no running.

917
00:34:10.399 --> 00:34:13.593
LAURA: So its turn is before Nott?

918
00:34:13.593 --> 00:34:15.393
Or this was a legendary, Jesus.

919
00:34:15.393 --> 00:34:16.682
TALIESIN: Three legendary actions.

920
00:34:16.682 --> 00:34:18.079
LAURA: Jesus, I hate this thing.

921
00:34:18.079 --> 00:34:20.012
TALIESIN: Yep, yep, this is stupid.

922
00:34:20.012 --> 00:34:22.416
MATT: So Nott, it's your turn.

923
00:34:22.416 --> 00:34:24.798
SAM: Is it engaged with anybody?

924
00:34:24.798 --> 00:34:29.798
MATT: It's current engaged, technically with Caleb.

925
00:34:29.949 --> 00:34:31.635
TALIESIN: Sorry, man.

926
00:34:31.635 --> 00:34:32.623
LIAM: It's all right.

927
00:34:32.623 --> 00:34:34.281
SAM: All right, ah!

928
00:34:34.281 --> 00:34:36.871
I will fire my crossbow bolt at it.

929
00:34:36.871 --> 00:34:38.650
TRAVIS: Crossbow bolt!
(Travis and Marisha laughing)

930
00:34:38.650 --> 00:34:41.129
SAM: I'll aim for one of those mouths.

931
00:34:41.129 --> 00:34:43.395
Ew, 14.

932
00:34:43.395 --> 00:34:44.930
TALIESIN: You have advantage.
SAM: I do?

933
00:34:44.930 --> 00:34:47.022
MATT: You do, because of Yasha's shout.

934
00:34:47.022 --> 00:34:49.517
Yasha's battle cry in the middle of the chamber,

935
00:34:49.517 --> 00:34:51.038
instilling you with--
SAM: 20.

936
00:34:51.038 --> 00:34:52.566
MATT: That does hit.

937
00:34:52.566 --> 00:34:54.149
SAM: Thank you, Yasha.

938
00:34:55.985 --> 00:34:56.818
TALIESIN: Whoa.

939
00:34:57.858 --> 00:34:59.116
Whoa.
SAM: Terrible, no,

940
00:34:59.116 --> 00:35:00.966
26 points of damage.

941
00:35:00.966 --> 00:35:02.549
MATT: Nice.

942
00:35:04.775 --> 00:35:07.564
SAM: Oh man, my Caleb is right there.

943
00:35:07.564 --> 00:35:09.897
How can I get him to safety?

944
00:35:11.513 --> 00:35:13.626
Ooh goo goo.

945
00:35:13.626 --> 00:35:16.393
Well, think about number one first.

946
00:35:16.393 --> 00:35:19.060
(laughter)

947
00:35:21.957 --> 00:35:25.694
I mean, I'm not strong enough to drag him, so,

948
00:35:25.694 --> 00:35:28.623
Caduceus, protect my Caleb!

949
00:35:28.623 --> 00:35:30.785
And I'll fire again and hide behind the pillar.

950
00:35:30.785 --> 00:35:31.618
MATT: Okay.

951
00:35:32.825 --> 00:35:34.310
SAM: Natural 20.

952
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:35.324
MARISHA: Boom!

953
00:35:35.324 --> 00:35:37.413
TRAVIS: Let's go!

954
00:35:37.413 --> 00:35:40.469
SAM: Rolling for damage, that's nine points of damage.

955
00:35:40.469 --> 00:35:43.166
It fires again.
MATT: Yes, it does.

956
00:35:43.166 --> 00:35:44.597
SAM: For a 15.

957
00:35:44.597 --> 00:35:45.520
MATT: 15 just hits.

958
00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:47.490
SAM: It hits!

959
00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:50.032
Another 11 points of damage.

960
00:35:50.032 --> 00:35:51.871
MATT: Nice, good round for Nott.

961
00:35:51.871 --> 00:35:55.103
TRAVIS: 44 points of damage.
MATT: (automatic gunfire)

962
00:35:55.103 --> 00:35:57.426
SAM: (whimpering)

963
00:35:57.426 --> 00:35:59.486
Then I will swing around that pillar

964
00:35:59.486 --> 00:36:01.376
and hide there shakily.

965
00:36:01.376 --> 00:36:03.051
MATT: All righty. Next to Yasha?

966
00:36:03.051 --> 00:36:04.278
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

967
00:36:04.278 --> 00:36:05.228
MATT: All right, you got it.

968
00:36:05.228 --> 00:36:06.811
Finishing Nott's go, Fjord, you're up.

969
00:36:06.811 --> 00:36:09.407
TRAVIS: Yeah, I will slide back just a little bit here

970
00:36:09.407 --> 00:36:12.684
so I can keep my eyes on that bastard,

971
00:36:12.684 --> 00:36:15.295
and two more Eldritch Blasts at it.

972
00:36:15.295 --> 00:36:16.295
MATT: Go for it.

973
00:36:17.279 --> 00:36:19.712
TRAVIS: A 17 and a 14.

974
00:36:19.712 --> 00:36:21.587
MATT: 17 hits, so one of them does make contact.

975
00:36:21.587 --> 00:36:22.704
TALIESIN: Is that both with advantage?

976
00:36:22.704 --> 00:36:24.027
TRAVIS: No, they are not.

977
00:36:24.027 --> 00:36:25.628
MATT: Is it attacks or is it melee attacks?

978
00:36:25.628 --> 00:36:27.269
ASHLEY: Attacks and saving, oh.

979
00:36:27.269 --> 00:36:28.166
MATT: Double-check.

980
00:36:28.166 --> 00:36:29.402
Because that would actually change based on it.

981
00:36:29.402 --> 00:36:31.985
ASHLEY: Let me double-check.

982
00:36:31.985 --> 00:36:34.408
You gain advantage on attack rolls and saving throws.

983
00:36:34.408 --> 00:36:35.924
MATT: Attack rolls, yeah, so you get
advantage on both of those.

984
00:36:35.924 --> 00:36:37.600
SAM: Wow, this shout is awesome.

985
00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:42.269
TRAVIS: That's a 22 and a, the second one still misses.

986
00:36:42.269 --> 00:36:43.424
MATT: Okay.

987
00:36:43.424 --> 00:36:46.090
TRAVIS: I just did one and one and two and two.

988
00:36:46.090 --> 00:36:48.437
That's 15 points of force damage.

989
00:36:48.437 --> 00:36:49.985
MATT: 15 points of force damage.

990
00:36:49.985 --> 00:36:51.153
It impacts.

991
00:36:51.153 --> 00:36:54.473
You see it almost swallows it, and on the inside,

992
00:36:54.473 --> 00:36:56.663
one of the eyes bulges and then rolls out

993
00:36:56.663 --> 00:36:58.417
and splats on the ground.
LAURA: Ew.

994
00:36:58.417 --> 00:37:02.479
MATT: You can see its body is starting to show some tear.

995
00:37:02.479 --> 00:37:06.861
It's starting to like, slop a bit and beginning to come

996
00:37:06.861 --> 00:37:08.473
a little apart at the seams.

997
00:37:08.473 --> 00:37:10.389
TRAVIS: I have 15 more feet of movement.

998
00:37:10.389 --> 00:37:11.775
Can I just use it to keep going back

999
00:37:11.775 --> 00:37:13.670
towards that back corner?

1000
00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:15.303
Just try and get as far back as I can.

1001
00:37:15.303 --> 00:37:16.136
MATT: Yeah, sure.

1002
00:37:16.136 --> 00:37:17.751
ASHLEY: Keep doing this?

1003
00:37:17.751 --> 00:37:20.084
TRAVIS: I can't run past it, yeah.

1004
00:37:21.267 --> 00:37:22.420
TALIESIN: As long as no one goes down,

1005
00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:23.478
there's some cool stuff I can do,

1006
00:37:23.478 --> 00:37:25.613
but people keep going down.

1007
00:37:25.613 --> 00:37:26.613
MATT: All right.

1008
00:37:27.715 --> 00:37:29.825
It's now Obann the Punished's turn.

1009
00:37:29.825 --> 00:37:31.973
MARISHA: Oh.
TALIESIN: Cool, cool, cool.

1010
00:37:31.973 --> 00:37:35.760
MATT: Does not get its Storm of Biting Shadow back,

1011
00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:38.351
so instead it's going to make three inky whip attacks.

1012
00:37:38.351 --> 00:37:39.660
SAM: Inky whip.
MATT: Inky whip.

1013
00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:41.068
LIAM: Diary of an Inky Whip.

1014
00:37:41.068 --> 00:37:46.068
MATT: One of them is going to be at

1015
00:37:46.551 --> 00:37:47.408
Caduceus.

1016
00:37:47.408 --> 00:37:48.988
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

1017
00:37:48.988 --> 00:37:49.887
MATT: That's a natural 20.

1018
00:37:49.887 --> 00:37:50.804
SAM: Ooh.
LAURA: Mm.

1019
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:55.834
TALIESIN: I will cancel the natural 20,
at least, as my reaction.

1020
00:37:55.834 --> 00:37:57.144
MATT: Because you can do that.
TALIESIN: I can do that.

1021
00:37:57.144 --> 00:37:59.042
MATT: All right, good call, good call.

1022
00:37:59.042 --> 00:38:01.300
All right, so you

1023
00:38:02.617 --> 00:38:05.250
take 16 points of necrotic damage

1024
00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:07.178
and are pulled 10 feet adjacent--

1025
00:38:07.178 --> 00:38:08.693
LAURA: No.

1026
00:38:08.693 --> 00:38:12.677
MATT: -- to Obann, it's going to make a strike at--

1027
00:38:13.549 --> 00:38:15.399
TALIESIN: 16 points?

1028
00:38:15.399 --> 00:38:16.232
MATT: 16 points.

1029
00:38:16.232 --> 00:38:21.232
It's going to make a strike at illusion Jester, and misses.

1030
00:38:21.721 --> 00:38:23.445
It's going to take a strike at real Jester,

1031
00:38:23.445 --> 00:38:24.721
because it has blindsight.

1032
00:38:24.721 --> 00:38:26.436
LAURA: Fuck me.
ASHLEY: (groans)

1033
00:38:26.436 --> 00:38:28.353
MARISHA: What?
SAM: Oh, what?

1034
00:38:28.353 --> 00:38:29.296
MATT: Natural one.

1035
00:38:29.296 --> 00:38:31.090
MARISHA: Oh!

1036
00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:32.421
SAM: Yes, yes.

1037
00:38:32.421 --> 00:38:34.847
MATT: And it's going to use its jagged bite attack on Caleb,

1038
00:38:34.847 --> 00:38:37.444
who's on the ground.
LIAM: Got to.

1039
00:38:37.444 --> 00:38:40.014
MATT: So you watch now as the tendrils like (whipping)

1040
00:38:40.014 --> 00:38:41.617
start whipping in different directions.

1041
00:38:41.617 --> 00:38:44.727
Part of the center of its body like opens,

1042
00:38:44.727 --> 00:38:48.429
like a weird, unfolding mouth with teeth,

1043
00:38:48.429 --> 00:38:51.929
and lunges down towards Caleb.
LAURA: Mm, mm-mm.

1044
00:38:53.182 --> 00:38:56.513
MATT: That's a 22 to hit.

1045
00:38:56.513 --> 00:38:57.354
LIAM: Hits.

1046
00:38:57.354 --> 00:38:58.212
MATT: All right.

1047
00:38:58.212 --> 00:39:02.147
Caleb, you suffer from the attack...

1048
00:39:02.147 --> 00:39:04.814
(dice rattling)

1049
00:39:06.198 --> 00:39:07.285
SAM: Oh.

1050
00:39:07.285 --> 00:39:08.476
Sounded like a lot.
MARISHA: Yeah, it did.

1051
00:39:08.476 --> 00:39:11.976
MATT: It didn't roll very well, though.

1052
00:39:13.847 --> 00:39:15.860
Take 21 points of piercing damage.

1053
00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:17.245
TALIESIN: You still up?
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

1054
00:39:17.245 --> 00:39:18.218
MATT: And I need you to make a strength saving throw.

1055
00:39:18.218 --> 00:39:20.968
LIAM: Okay, hold on.
TALIESIN: With advantage.

1056
00:39:24.814 --> 00:39:26.445
LIAM: Blessed still, too?
MATT: No.

1057
00:39:26.445 --> 00:39:29.184
LIAM: No, so strength, 17.

1058
00:39:29.184 --> 00:39:30.599
MATT: 17.

1059
00:39:30.599 --> 00:39:31.791
You are swallowed.

1060
00:39:31.791 --> 00:39:33.791
TRAVIS, LAURA, and SAM: (gasping)

1061
00:39:33.791 --> 00:39:36.063
MARISHA: Yeah, now we're killing it, yeah.
SAM: No!

1062
00:39:36.063 --> 00:39:37.209
LAURA and TALIESIN: Cool, cool, cool, cool.

1063
00:39:37.209 --> 00:39:40.264
MATT: So you watch as the mouth closes around Caleb

1064
00:39:40.264 --> 00:39:42.839
and then just engulfs him.

1065
00:39:42.839 --> 00:39:44.532
LIAM: Ooh, <i>Scheiße</i>!

1066
00:39:44.532 --> 00:39:45.674
MATT: (chuckles)

1067
00:39:45.674 --> 00:39:46.682
MARISHA: ♪ Watch him whip, ♪
TRAVIS: Oh, Matt.

1068
00:39:46.682 --> 00:39:49.761
TRAVIS: From the first melee attack he made against me--
MARISHA: ♪ watch him num-num ♪

1069
00:39:49.761 --> 00:39:51.963
TRAVIS: -- he takes five points of radiant damage.

1070
00:39:51.963 --> 00:39:53.096
MATT: Ooh, good call.
TRAVIS: From the sword.

1071
00:39:53.096 --> 00:39:54.830
MATT: Thank you for that, good call.

1072
00:39:54.830 --> 00:39:55.681
All right.

1073
00:39:55.681 --> 00:39:57.701
That finishes Obann's turn.

1074
00:39:57.701 --> 00:40:00.691
ASHLEY: That might be my favorite thing you've ever said.

1075
00:40:00.691 --> 00:40:02.323
♪ Oh watch him num-num ♪

1076
00:40:02.323 --> 00:40:06.095
MATT: Seeing it come close, and it now

1077
00:40:06.095 --> 00:40:09.945
showing some wear and tear, watching you get eaten.

1078
00:40:09.945 --> 00:40:10.843
SAM: Oh no, it's going to try to leave.

1079
00:40:10.843 --> 00:40:11.901
LAURA: Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm.

1080
00:40:11.901 --> 00:40:14.049
SAM: Fjord, get ready.

1081
00:40:14.049 --> 00:40:15.902
MATT: Caedogeist vanishes into the floor.

1082
00:40:15.902 --> 00:40:17.114
ASHLEY: No.

1083
00:40:17.114 --> 00:40:19.361
MATT: And then pops--
LAURA: And she-- yes!

1084
00:40:19.361 --> 00:40:20.777
SAM: To help, or?

1085
00:40:20.777 --> 00:40:23.046
MATT: And is going to strike Obann the Punished.

1086
00:40:23.046 --> 00:40:25.061
TALIESIN: Hey!
LAURA: Caedogeist!

1087
00:40:25.061 --> 00:40:27.494
I knew she was cool.
ASHLEY: Yep.

1088
00:40:27.494 --> 00:40:28.802
MATT: All right.

1089
00:40:28.802 --> 00:40:31.819
TRAVIS: Dead for thousands of years, totally cool.

1090
00:40:31.819 --> 00:40:33.511
Hundreds of years. Dead for a while?

1091
00:40:33.511 --> 00:40:36.453
MATT: Created by a union between Lolth and Asmodeus,

1092
00:40:36.453 --> 00:40:38.685
totally cool.
TRAVIS: Super cool.

1093
00:40:38.685 --> 00:40:40.228
TALIESIN: Everyone's got weird parents.

1094
00:40:40.228 --> 00:40:42.940
MARISHA: (laughs)
MATT: Natural 20.

1095
00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:44.268
And a--
TRAVIS: Whoa.

1096
00:40:44.268 --> 00:40:46.863
MATT: Yeah, both hit.

1097
00:40:46.863 --> 00:40:48.026
TALIESIN: Sneak attack.

1098
00:40:48.026 --> 00:40:49.101
LAURA: Caedogeist gets the how do you want to do this.

1099
00:40:49.101 --> 00:40:50.975
MATT: It does get sneak attack on the natural 20.

1100
00:40:50.975 --> 00:40:51.891
Which is really nasty, actually.

1101
00:40:51.891 --> 00:40:52.724
TRAVIS: Come on, come on.

1102
00:40:52.724 --> 00:40:55.446
TALIESIN: Just mentioning that.
ASHLEY: Come on, come on, come on.

1103
00:40:57.071 --> 00:40:58.703
MATT: Shitty roll, though.

1104
00:40:58.703 --> 00:40:59.635
LAURA and MARISHA: Aww.

1105
00:40:59.635 --> 00:41:02.829
LAURA: Come on, Matt, get a how do I want to do this?

1106
00:41:02.829 --> 00:41:06.197
TRAVIS: That would be great.
ASHLEY: That would be cool.

1107
00:41:06.197 --> 00:41:08.107
MARISHA: We all get to tell it to him?

1108
00:41:08.107 --> 00:41:12.180
How would it work?
TRAVIS: It's like an ouroboros, eats itself.

1109
00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:13.832
MARISHA: We're stuck in a loop for the rest of time.

1110
00:41:13.832 --> 00:41:17.767
MATT: 40 points of damage on that crit, which is not bad.

1111
00:41:17.767 --> 00:41:19.616
Not great, but not bad.

1112
00:41:19.616 --> 00:41:21.503
It is immune to poison, so unaffected by that,

1113
00:41:21.503 --> 00:41:23.723
and its second attack is going to be--

1114
00:41:23.723 --> 00:41:25.967
SAM: Come on, Caedo.
ASHLEY: Howdy doody do dis?

1115
00:41:25.967 --> 00:41:27.146
TRAVIS: Come on, Geist.

1116
00:41:27.146 --> 00:41:28.559
MATT: 11 points of damage, okay.

1117
00:41:28.559 --> 00:41:31.192
That is going to end the Caedogeist's turn.

1118
00:41:31.192 --> 00:41:32.025
SAM: It's good.

1119
00:41:32.025 --> 00:41:33.640
TALIESIN: That was pretty good, though.

1120
00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:35.251
MATT: That brings us to, actually, at the end

1121
00:41:35.251 --> 00:41:37.717
of Caedogeist's turn, it's going to go ahead and do

1122
00:41:37.717 --> 00:41:42.315
another legendary action, now that it got them all back.

1123
00:41:42.315 --> 00:41:46.982
It is going to use two of its actions to Spill Darkness.

1124
00:41:48.386 --> 00:41:52.933
You watch as now mouths begin to fold in,

1125
00:41:52.933 --> 00:41:55.509
the toothy jaws begin to disappear,

1126
00:41:55.509 --> 00:41:57.443
and eyes begin to emerge where they are,

1127
00:41:57.443 --> 00:41:58.776
but the eyes are black.

1128
00:41:58.776 --> 00:42:02.468
Just these like black sclera, reflective dark surfaces,

1129
00:42:02.468 --> 00:42:04.779
and as it does, this ink-like black smoke

1130
00:42:04.779 --> 00:42:05.703
begin to pour out of them.

1131
00:42:05.703 --> 00:42:06.536
LIAM: Nah.

1132
00:42:06.536 --> 00:42:08.446
MATT: Within a 20 foot radius around.

1133
00:42:08.446 --> 00:42:10.580
LAURA: You don't see it, because you're swallowed.

1134
00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:12.897
MATT: So this entire space here.
SAM: Oh god.

1135
00:42:12.897 --> 00:42:14.870
MATT: Everyone except for Yasha and Fjord,

1136
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:17.057
you are engulfed in magical darkness.

1137
00:42:17.057 --> 00:42:19.025
TRAVIS: Fucking shit!
MATT: You cannot see.

1138
00:42:19.025 --> 00:42:21.429
LAURA: And Nott, Nott is out of the darkness too.

1139
00:42:21.429 --> 00:42:22.430
MATT: Oh yeah, Nott, sorry.

1140
00:42:22.430 --> 00:42:23.889
You were hidden literally behind the pillar.

1141
00:42:23.889 --> 00:42:25.515
You stealthed away from the DM.

1142
00:42:25.515 --> 00:42:27.732
(laughter)

1143
00:42:27.732 --> 00:42:28.846
TRAVIS: No!

1144
00:42:28.846 --> 00:42:29.960
MATT: That's going to finish that go.

1145
00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:31.161
Beau, you're up first.

1146
00:42:31.161 --> 00:42:35.288
MARISHA: So even with my goggles, it's still dark?

1147
00:42:35.288 --> 00:42:37.010
MATT: It's not standard darkness, this is magical darkness.

1148
00:42:37.010 --> 00:42:38.509
You are blind.

1149
00:42:38.509 --> 00:42:40.294
MARISHA: So I have disadvantage on my attacks?

1150
00:42:40.294 --> 00:42:41.663
MATT: Yes.
SAM: Yeah, but you're a monk.

1151
00:42:41.663 --> 00:42:45.895
MARISHA: But with Yasha's stuff, it balances?

1152
00:42:45.895 --> 00:42:47.554
MATT: Balances out, I would say, yeah.

1153
00:42:47.554 --> 00:42:48.979
MARISHA: Fuck.
SAM: But you're a monk.

1154
00:42:48.979 --> 00:42:50.203
MARISHA: That was going to be so cool.

1155
00:42:50.203 --> 00:42:53.009
SAM: Don't you have like, heightened senses or something?

1156
00:42:53.009 --> 00:42:55.409
TRAVIS: Can see through abyssal blackness.

1157
00:42:55.409 --> 00:42:59.001
SAM: Fight by the sense of smell?
LAURA: Her hearing is really, really, really good.

1158
00:42:59.001 --> 00:43:01.492
SAM: Taste the air?
MARISHA: No.

1159
00:43:01.492 --> 00:43:04.609
I don't have anything like that.

1160
00:43:04.609 --> 00:43:05.978
SAM: Can we just say that you do?

1161
00:43:05.978 --> 00:43:07.571
MARISHA: (laughs)

1162
00:43:07.571 --> 00:43:11.577
All right, well, I'm going to crack my neck and

1163
00:43:11.577 --> 00:43:13.862
(exhales), just close my eyes anyway,

1164
00:43:13.862 --> 00:43:15.637
because I can't fucking see,

1165
00:43:15.637 --> 00:43:19.536
and start wailing on this guy.

1166
00:43:19.536 --> 00:43:21.594
MATT: All right, so you move in--

1167
00:43:21.594 --> 00:43:23.960
MARISHA: Spit. Out. The wizard!

1168
00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:25.710
MATT: -- to where you saw it last, and trying,

1169
00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:28.138
still inspired by Yasha's scream of vengeance,

1170
00:43:28.138 --> 00:43:30.170
you rush in and hope you make contact.

1171
00:43:30.170 --> 00:43:32.553
So just straight rolls.

1172
00:43:32.553 --> 00:43:34.725
TRAVIS: (sighs)

1173
00:43:34.725 --> 00:43:35.558
MARISHA: 13.

1174
00:43:35.558 --> 00:43:37.033
MATT: 13 misses.

1175
00:43:37.033 --> 00:43:39.199
MARISHA: 16.
MATT: Does hit.

1176
00:43:39.199 --> 00:43:41.416
MARISHA: These are all garbage rolls, 10.

1177
00:43:41.416 --> 00:43:43.948
MATT: 10 damage, all righty.

1178
00:43:43.948 --> 00:43:45.031
Bonus action?

1179
00:43:47.514 --> 00:43:52.306
MARISHA: I'm going to use my
last ki point to Flurry of Blows.

1180
00:43:52.306 --> 00:43:54.339
MATT: Okay, two more strikes, straight rolls.

1181
00:43:54.339 --> 00:43:55.816
MARISHA: I hope that's not a mistake.

1182
00:43:55.816 --> 00:43:57.233
MATT: We'll find out.

1183
00:43:58.117 --> 00:43:59.429
MARISHA: Two more hits.

1184
00:43:59.429 --> 00:44:02.754
LIAM: Natural one.
LAURA: No! No!

1185
00:44:06.984 --> 00:44:08.084
MARISHA: 22.

1186
00:44:08.084 --> 00:44:09.320
MATT: All right, so that one does hit.

1187
00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:10.489
MARISHA: 10.

1188
00:44:10.489 --> 00:44:11.702
MATT: 10 points of damage a second time.

1189
00:44:11.702 --> 00:44:14.203
So you go and swing wildly, the first one just goes wide,

1190
00:44:14.203 --> 00:44:17.302
the second one impacts inside it, "I found it!"

1191
00:44:17.302 --> 00:44:19.523
You go to punch a second time in the same direction,

1192
00:44:19.523 --> 00:44:21.990
and you find nothing, and right as you reach in,

1193
00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:24.359
something closes on your arm.

1194
00:44:24.359 --> 00:44:26.154
As soon as the teeth begin to pierce the flesh,

1195
00:44:26.154 --> 00:44:28.016
you react and pull your hand out.

1196
00:44:28.016 --> 00:44:29.429
It scrapes, not enough to do damage,

1197
00:44:29.429 --> 00:44:31.956
but you pull out just as you hear it slam right behind,

1198
00:44:31.956 --> 00:44:33.992
and then get one final kick in before you're like,

1199
00:44:33.992 --> 00:44:35.203
"Okay, that was bad."

1200
00:44:35.203 --> 00:44:36.477
MARISHA: That was harder than I thought.

1201
00:44:36.477 --> 00:44:37.879
I thought I was going to be a badass,

1202
00:44:37.879 --> 00:44:40.428
but that, actually-- I'm not.

1203
00:44:40.428 --> 00:44:41.261
TRAVIS: Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

1204
00:44:41.261 --> 00:44:42.919
MATT: Finish your turn, Beau?
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

1205
00:44:42.919 --> 00:44:44.115
MATT: All right, Caleb.

1206
00:44:44.115 --> 00:44:46.780
LIAM: Is Caleb able to cast at all?

1207
00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:50.134
MATT: Caleb, you are, you're able to cast if you'd like.

1208
00:44:50.134 --> 00:44:51.786
You...

1209
00:44:53.192 --> 00:44:54.192
LAURA: Oh my god.

1210
00:44:56.568 --> 00:44:57.893
MATT: You are blind and restrained.

1211
00:44:57.893 --> 00:44:58.751
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

1212
00:45:00.199 --> 00:45:01.041
MATT: Yeah, that's it.

1213
00:45:01.041 --> 00:45:03.978
LIAM: But he's able to do somatic, or?

1214
00:45:03.978 --> 00:45:05.304
MATT: Yeah, you can.

1215
00:45:05.304 --> 00:45:06.962
LIAM: Caleb turns into a giant ape.

1216
00:45:06.962 --> 00:45:09.579
TRAVIS: (inhales)
MATT: A giant ape, okay.

1217
00:45:11.054 --> 00:45:15.014
MARISHA: What if it just stretches around you?
MATT: What size is a giant ape? Large?

1218
00:45:15.922 --> 00:45:17.261
SAM: Oh yeah, this thing doesn't have, like, bones.

1219
00:45:17.261 --> 00:45:18.094
LIAM: Huge.

1220
00:45:18.094 --> 00:45:20.173
LAURA: It's like a ball sack.

1221
00:45:20.173 --> 00:45:21.888
SAM: (laughs)

1222
00:45:21.888 --> 00:45:23.450
It's a huge testicle.

1223
00:45:24.633 --> 00:45:28.333
MATT: I'm going to make a constitution saving throw.

1224
00:45:29.415 --> 00:45:31.698
Make an intelligence check for me.

1225
00:45:31.698 --> 00:45:33.500
Roll a d20 and add your intelligence modifier.

1226
00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:35.237
LIAM: As the ape, yeah?
MATT: Yes.

1227
00:45:35.237 --> 00:45:37.317
Or as Caleb, casting a spell.

1228
00:45:37.317 --> 00:45:38.234
LIAM: Oh, okay.

1229
00:45:39.201 --> 00:45:40.840
(humming)

1230
00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:43.801
Just straight intelligence?
MATT: Correct.

1231
00:45:43.801 --> 00:45:45.854
LIAM: 28.

1232
00:45:45.854 --> 00:45:47.170
MATT: 28.

1233
00:45:47.170 --> 00:45:48.003
Okay.

1234
00:45:48.003 --> 00:45:48.940
Yeah.

1235
00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:53.940
You emerge, after being spit out into shadow,

1236
00:45:54.597 --> 00:45:57.347
prone, as a giant ape, which I don't have a giant ape

1237
00:45:57.347 --> 00:46:00.258
huge mini, because that was unexpected.

1238
00:46:00.258 --> 00:46:02.272
TRAVIS: (laughs)

1239
00:46:02.272 --> 00:46:06.234
MATT: But for size, here. We'll just use this.

1240
00:46:06.234 --> 00:46:08.504
So you know the huge size.
LAURA: Whoa.

1241
00:46:08.504 --> 00:46:09.516
SAM: Damn.

1242
00:46:09.516 --> 00:46:12.191
MATT: You are the size of the
creature that just devoured you.

1243
00:46:12.191 --> 00:46:13.024
SAM: Whoa.

1244
00:46:13.024 --> 00:46:15.579
MATT: So you are spit out onto the side.

1245
00:46:15.579 --> 00:46:17.936
No damage taken, but you are regurgitated.

1246
00:46:17.936 --> 00:46:18.990
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

1247
00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:21.203
I will use my movement to stand.

1248
00:46:21.203 --> 00:46:22.437
MATT: So half movement, you get back up,

1249
00:46:22.437 --> 00:46:23.658
and you're just blind still.

1250
00:46:23.658 --> 00:46:26.049
You're no longer burning and like,

1251
00:46:26.049 --> 00:46:29.122
feeling 1,000 teeth carving away at you from the inside

1252
00:46:29.122 --> 00:46:32.180
as you tear your way out of the interior of this creature,

1253
00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:33.248
and now it's just darkness around you.

1254
00:46:33.248 --> 00:46:35.011
LIAM: Are we deafened as well, or just blind?
MATT: Just blind.

1255
00:46:35.011 --> 00:46:39.652
LIAM: Then everyone hears (grunting, roars).

1256
00:46:39.652 --> 00:46:41.325
LAURA: Oh god, what's happening now?!

1257
00:46:41.325 --> 00:46:43.100
SAM: There's another monster?!
TALIESIN: Oh man.

1258
00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:45.045
(laughter)

1259
00:46:45.045 --> 00:46:46.823
MATT: Do you stay where you are, or do you want to move?

1260
00:46:46.823 --> 00:46:49.324
LIAM: I used my action to cast.

1261
00:46:49.324 --> 00:46:50.578
MATT: Use your action to cast, you still have

1262
00:46:50.578 --> 00:46:51.838
your movement as your ape.

1263
00:46:51.838 --> 00:46:53.264
LIAM: Oh, to get up?
MATT: You used half your speed,

1264
00:46:53.264 --> 00:46:54.634
so you still have half the ape's speed.

1265
00:46:54.634 --> 00:46:58.103
LIAM: Oh, well, I will feel around
and try to feel the squish.

1266
00:46:58.103 --> 00:46:58.936
MATT: Okay.

1267
00:46:58.936 --> 00:47:01.235
LIAM: And try to tear the thing apart, which I don't have

1268
00:47:01.235 --> 00:47:03.934
economy to do, but I'm just going to use my ape fists

1269
00:47:03.934 --> 00:47:05.459
to feel for the squishy thing.

1270
00:47:05.459 --> 00:47:07.888
MATT: Do you have reach?

1271
00:47:07.888 --> 00:47:08.988
As an ape.

1272
00:47:10.476 --> 00:47:12.519
SAM: ♪ Come on, feel the squish ♪

1273
00:47:12.519 --> 00:47:15.054
TRAVIS: How far can an ape reach?

1274
00:47:15.054 --> 00:47:16.153
LIAM: Reach 10 feet.

1275
00:47:16.153 --> 00:47:17.703
MATT: So yeah, you reach around and you

1276
00:47:17.703 --> 00:47:19.519
gather generally where it is, and you can hear

1277
00:47:19.519 --> 00:47:22.501
the sound of it, too. (slurping)

1278
00:47:22.501 --> 00:47:23.408
LIAM: Okay.

1279
00:47:23.408 --> 00:47:24.724
I'm getting ready, I'm pissed off.

1280
00:47:24.724 --> 00:47:27.774
MATT: All right, cool. That finishes Caleb's go.

1281
00:47:27.774 --> 00:47:29.246
LIAM: (breathing heavily)

1282
00:47:29.246 --> 00:47:31.414
MATT: End of Caleb's turn, it's going to use

1283
00:47:31.414 --> 00:47:36.414
another inky whip attack. This one's going to be at,

1284
00:47:36.867 --> 00:47:38.728
let's say Caduceus.

1285
00:47:38.728 --> 00:47:40.099
TRAVIS: ♪ Inky whip ♪

1286
00:47:40.099 --> 00:47:41.462
ASHLEY: ♪ Watch me num-num ♪

1287
00:47:41.462 --> 00:47:44.137
MATT: 28 to hit.
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, that hits.

1288
00:47:44.137 --> 00:47:46.071
MATT: All right.
TALIESIN: Back off.

1289
00:47:46.071 --> 00:47:48.294
LIAM: 157 hit point healing spell.

1290
00:47:48.294 --> 00:47:51.498
MATT: You take 20 points of necrotic damage.

1291
00:47:51.498 --> 00:47:53.352
TALIESIN: Fudge you.
LAURA: 20 points?!

1292
00:47:53.352 --> 00:47:55.380
MATT: Yep. And you are pulled towards it, but you already

1293
00:47:55.380 --> 00:47:58.659
are there next to it.
TALIESIN: Already there.

1294
00:47:58.659 --> 00:48:00.305
MATT: Caduceus, it's your turn.

1295
00:48:00.305 --> 00:48:05.305
TALIESIN: So I have a verbal somatic spell,

1296
00:48:05.329 --> 00:48:10.329
which is an action to cast at the creature.

1297
00:48:11.104 --> 00:48:14.175
What's the deal with casting that in blind?

1298
00:48:14.175 --> 00:48:17.634
MATT: If the spell says "a creature you can see."

1299
00:48:17.634 --> 00:48:19.355
TALIESIN: "Creature within range," no.

1300
00:48:19.355 --> 00:48:21.204
MATT: Then you can just cast it in that direction.

1301
00:48:21.204 --> 00:48:22.461
LAURA: Fuck yeah.
TALIESIN: Okay.

1302
00:48:22.461 --> 00:48:24.448
MATT: Yeah, certain spells require you to see the target,

1303
00:48:24.448 --> 00:48:26.220
in which case the blindness would prevent you from--

1304
00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:27.948
TALIESIN: So Ray of Enfeeblement would technically

1305
00:48:27.948 --> 00:48:29.191
work here, then.

1306
00:48:29.191 --> 00:48:30.684
MATT: It would. As a ray,

1307
00:48:30.684 --> 00:48:31.750
you still have to roll to hit, correct?

1308
00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:33.442
TALIESIN: No, it's a con save.

1309
00:48:33.442 --> 00:48:35.240
MATT: Hmm, I thought ray spells, all right.

1310
00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:37.152
TALIESIN: Yeah, you'd think.

1311
00:48:37.152 --> 00:48:38.319
MATT: Okay.

1312
00:48:43.432 --> 00:48:45.653
Is this a grave cleric thing, too?

1313
00:48:45.653 --> 00:48:47.359
TALIESIN: That I cannot tell you.

1314
00:48:47.359 --> 00:48:49.131
MATT: No, "make a ranged spell attack against the target."

1315
00:48:49.131 --> 00:48:50.154
It is.

1316
00:48:50.154 --> 00:48:54.495
TALIESIN: Okay, because it says "attack save: con 17."

1317
00:48:54.495 --> 00:48:56.263
MATT: Right, at the end of each of its turns,

1318
00:48:56.263 --> 00:48:58.423
it makes a save to resist the effect.

1319
00:48:58.423 --> 00:48:59.466
LAURA and TALIESIN: Oh.

1320
00:48:59.466 --> 00:49:00.465
MATT: I remember you forgot that last time.

1321
00:49:00.465 --> 00:49:01.298
LAURA: Okay, okay.

1322
00:49:01.298 --> 00:49:03.516
MATT: Yeah, most ray spells, as part of the rays,

1323
00:49:03.516 --> 00:49:05.020
you still have to aim to fire, so.

1324
00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:06.389
TALIESIN: Okay, well in that case--

1325
00:49:06.389 --> 00:49:07.567
LAURA: But you're right in front of him,

1326
00:49:07.567 --> 00:49:09.435
you know he just pulled you to him.

1327
00:49:09.435 --> 00:49:11.304
TALIESIN: Yeah, but I don't know if that's--

1328
00:49:11.304 --> 00:49:12.550
MATT: You still have disadvantage on the strike.

1329
00:49:12.550 --> 00:49:13.783
TALIESIN: Yeah.
LAURA: Has Yasha gone yet?

1330
00:49:13.783 --> 00:49:15.119
MATT: Though Yasha hasn't gone yet,
so you would have advantage,

1331
00:49:15.119 --> 00:49:16.992
so it would just be a single roll, so it's up to you.

1332
00:49:16.992 --> 00:49:18.261
TALIESIN: Yeah, let's do it.

1333
00:49:18.261 --> 00:49:20.978
Let's Ray of Enfeeblement, because this'll help shit a lot

1334
00:49:20.978 --> 00:49:22.368
if this works well.

1335
00:49:22.368 --> 00:49:23.623
What do I add to this?

1336
00:49:23.623 --> 00:49:25.555
Is this just my spell?

1337
00:49:25.555 --> 00:49:27.327
MATT: You add your spell attack modifier.

1338
00:49:27.327 --> 00:49:30.178
TALIESIN: So it's just a five.

1339
00:49:30.178 --> 00:49:33.093
Oh, spell attack, nine, okay, there we go.

1340
00:49:33.093 --> 00:49:34.239
Oh, come on.

1341
00:49:34.239 --> 00:49:35.168
LAURA: Here we go, here we go, here we go.

1342
00:49:35.168 --> 00:49:36.238
TALIESIN: Ah, 18.

1343
00:49:36.238 --> 00:49:37.663
MATT: 18 hits.

1344
00:49:37.663 --> 00:49:38.569
SAM: Nice.

1345
00:49:38.569 --> 00:49:39.963
TALIESIN: So you're half damage.

1346
00:49:39.963 --> 00:49:42.060
MATT: Half damage for attacks that use?

1347
00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:43.193
TALIESIN: Strength.
MATT: Strength?

1348
00:49:43.193 --> 00:49:44.617
You got it.

1349
00:49:44.617 --> 00:49:46.201
TALIESIN: Which assume these have been using.

1350
00:49:46.201 --> 00:49:47.311
MATT: You'll find out.

1351
00:49:47.311 --> 00:49:48.175
TALIESIN: I will find out.

1352
00:49:48.175 --> 00:49:49.187
Shit balls.

1353
00:49:49.187 --> 00:49:50.643
TRAVIS: (laughs)

1354
00:49:50.643 --> 00:49:55.643
TALIESIN: That is, I'm just making a big assumption there.

1355
00:49:56.519 --> 00:49:59.059
Hasn't used its reaction yet?

1356
00:49:59.059 --> 00:49:59.945
MATT: It has not.

1357
00:49:59.945 --> 00:50:02.493
TALIESIN: Okay, so I'm still stuck here.

1358
00:50:02.493 --> 00:50:04.525
MATT: Unless you want to risk it.

1359
00:50:04.525 --> 00:50:05.800
TALIESIN: (sighs)

1360
00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:06.941
SAM: Do it, do it.

1361
00:50:06.941 --> 00:50:08.266
LAURA: Where would you go?

1362
00:50:08.266 --> 00:50:09.473
MATT: I'm playing the part of Travis now.

1363
00:50:09.473 --> 00:50:13.623
TALIESIN: You are. You're terrible.
MATT: Gamble! (laughs)

1364
00:50:13.623 --> 00:50:17.071
TALIESIN: And I can't use any of my other...

1365
00:50:17.071 --> 00:50:20.216
Can't use a 1st-level spell as a bonus action right now.

1366
00:50:20.216 --> 00:50:21.471
LAURA: Mm-mm.
TALIESIN: Nope.

1367
00:50:21.471 --> 00:50:23.346
I got nothing.

1368
00:50:23.346 --> 00:50:27.460
So yeah, I'm just going to steady myself and--

1369
00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:29.026
MATT: Stay in place? All right.
TALIESIN: Stay in place.

1370
00:50:29.026 --> 00:50:31.297
MATT: End of Caduceus's turn, Yasha, you're up,

1371
00:50:31.297 --> 00:50:32.722
with Jester on deck.

1372
00:50:32.722 --> 00:50:34.088
ASHLEY: Okay.

1373
00:50:34.088 --> 00:50:36.114
MATT: You see this wall of shadow

1374
00:50:36.114 --> 00:50:37.765
engulf that side of the room, and you can see

1375
00:50:37.765 --> 00:50:41.051
it's swirling, and it's pulsing weirdly.

1376
00:50:41.051 --> 00:50:43.846
There's a source to it that's keeping it at bay.

1377
00:50:43.846 --> 00:50:46.293
So you have no idea quite where anything is.

1378
00:50:46.293 --> 00:50:48.156
You can guess based on what you last saw.

1379
00:50:48.156 --> 00:50:50.544
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm going to march right in there.

1380
00:50:50.544 --> 00:50:51.377
MATT: Okay.

1381
00:50:52.217 --> 00:50:55.326
ASHLEY: And try to feel around for the squishy.

1382
00:50:57.524 --> 00:50:59.450
Walking with one hand forward.

1383
00:50:59.450 --> 00:51:02.855
MATT: I'll say it takes all your movement to get up to it,

1384
00:51:02.855 --> 00:51:04.280
but you can.
ASHLEY: Okay.

1385
00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:05.883
MATT: I'll allow that, because you're

1386
00:51:05.883 --> 00:51:08.275
moving around, feeling out, blade in one hand,

1387
00:51:08.275 --> 00:51:10.214
pushing past Caduceus for a second, making sure,

1388
00:51:10.214 --> 00:51:11.989
you know, Caduceus isn't the creature.

1389
00:51:11.989 --> 00:51:13.750
Hearing the sounds and following your way there,

1390
00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:17.425
so I'll say half speed you get there, but you do.

1391
00:51:17.425 --> 00:51:19.506
ASHLEY: So I'd like to make an attack.

1392
00:51:19.506 --> 00:51:20.718
MATT: Okay.

1393
00:51:20.718 --> 00:51:22.231
Now, are these reckless or not?

1394
00:51:22.231 --> 00:51:23.656
Because you have disadvantage on this,

1395
00:51:23.656 --> 00:51:25.194
because you are blinded within the radius.

1396
00:51:25.194 --> 00:51:27.024
ASHLEY: But with the battle cry?

1397
00:51:27.024 --> 00:51:28.100
MATT: It was the end of your next turn, right?

1398
00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:29.324
Or was it beginning of your next turn?

1399
00:51:29.324 --> 00:51:30.681
ASHLEY: Oh, yeah, it's the start of my next turn.

1400
00:51:30.681 --> 00:51:31.769
You are correct, sir.

1401
00:51:31.769 --> 00:51:33.263
MATT: So you'll have to be reckless to--

1402
00:51:33.263 --> 00:51:35.383
TRAVIS: Get a straight roll.

1403
00:51:35.383 --> 00:51:37.078
MATT: Otherwise you have disadvantage on the strikes.

1404
00:51:37.078 --> 00:51:38.328
It's up to you.

1405
00:51:40.325 --> 00:51:41.508
ASHLEY: Yeah, reckless.

1406
00:51:41.508 --> 00:51:42.621
MATT: All right, so a straight roll.

1407
00:51:42.621 --> 00:51:43.721
First attack was?

1408
00:51:43.721 --> 00:51:45.797
ASHLEY: Well, I mean, it's shit.

1409
00:51:45.797 --> 00:51:48.986
(laughter)

1410
00:51:48.986 --> 00:51:50.094
ASHLEY: Let's see.

1411
00:51:50.094 --> 00:51:51.380
I don't know why I was arguing for something

1412
00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:52.550
that's not going to work.

1413
00:51:52.550 --> 00:51:53.743
(laughter)

1414
00:51:53.743 --> 00:51:54.646
ASHLEY: 11.

1415
00:51:54.646 --> 00:51:55.635
MATT: 11 misses.

1416
00:51:55.635 --> 00:51:58.162
So your first strike goes wide, and actually

1417
00:51:58.162 --> 00:52:00.561
almost goes towards Caduceus.

1418
00:52:00.561 --> 00:52:03.389
Caduceus, you hear the wind just miss you by inches.

1419
00:52:03.389 --> 00:52:06.374
ASHLEY: Okay, there we go.

1420
00:52:06.374 --> 00:52:07.689
(laughs)

1421
00:52:07.689 --> 00:52:08.732
19, 27.

1422
00:52:08.732 --> 00:52:10.435
MATT: 27 does hit, go ahead and
roll your full damage on that,

1423
00:52:10.435 --> 00:52:13.935
including your bonus d6.
SAM: Kill this thing.

1424
00:52:15.794 --> 00:52:16.877
ASHLEY: Okay.

1425
00:52:21.165 --> 00:52:22.442
15.

1426
00:52:22.442 --> 00:52:24.518
MATT: 15 damage, nice.

1427
00:52:24.518 --> 00:52:26.100
All righty.

1428
00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:28.300
That finish your turn, Yasha?

1429
00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:30.161
ASHLEY: Uh-huh.
MATT: Jester, you're up.

1430
00:52:30.161 --> 00:52:32.275
LAURA: Okay.
SAM: Ooh.

1431
00:52:32.275 --> 00:52:35.066
You're in double magical darkness right now.

1432
00:52:35.066 --> 00:52:36.492
LAURA: Double it!

1433
00:52:36.492 --> 00:52:37.467
MATT: Super blind.

1434
00:52:37.467 --> 00:52:41.228
LAURA: I'm going to cast Dispel Magic

1435
00:52:41.228 --> 00:52:44.644
on the area of effect spell!

1436
00:52:44.644 --> 00:52:46.558
MARISHA: Yay!
MATT: Okay, on this one here?

1437
00:52:46.558 --> 00:52:49.598
LAURA: On the stuff that he cast.

1438
00:52:49.598 --> 00:52:52.932
I'm going to step forward, how about that?

1439
00:52:52.932 --> 00:52:54.648
SAM: Are you trying to--

1440
00:52:54.648 --> 00:52:56.903
LAURA: I'm trying to dispel his fucking darkness.

1441
00:52:56.903 --> 00:53:00.996
SAM: But there's two effects going at the same time.

1442
00:53:00.996 --> 00:53:04.140
MATT: All right, so, you would probably have to move

1443
00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:06.495
out of this radius.

1444
00:53:06.495 --> 00:53:08.168
As far as you're concerned, you don't know

1445
00:53:08.168 --> 00:53:09.871
that it emanated darkness.
LAURA: Right.

1446
00:53:09.871 --> 00:53:11.902
MATT: Because you've been in shadow this whole time.

1447
00:53:11.902 --> 00:53:14.486
That's what I would argue for.

1448
00:53:14.486 --> 00:53:18.423
Unless you chose to step out of it and notice it,

1449
00:53:18.423 --> 00:53:20.015
and wanted to do that.

1450
00:53:20.015 --> 00:53:21.551
LAURA: Right, okay, I haven't seen it.

1451
00:53:21.551 --> 00:53:22.766
MATT: But you've been in darkness for a full round,

1452
00:53:22.766 --> 00:53:24.618
you don't even know that he emanated that.

1453
00:53:24.618 --> 00:53:26.306
LAURA: All right, then fuck it.

1454
00:53:26.306 --> 00:53:28.446
I was trying to help you guys, but I can't,

1455
00:53:28.446 --> 00:53:30.330
so I'm just going to step forward

1456
00:53:30.330 --> 00:53:32.964
until I can smash into the blob,

1457
00:53:32.964 --> 00:53:36.757
and then I'm going to cast Inflict Wounds at 3rd-level.

1458
00:53:36.757 --> 00:53:38.217
MATT: All righty.

1459
00:53:38.217 --> 00:53:39.418
SAM and TRAVIS: "In-flick."

1460
00:53:39.418 --> 00:53:40.910
LAURA: In-flick Wounds!

1461
00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:44.465
MATT: So you come out, hearing it in the general direction,

1462
00:53:44.465 --> 00:53:46.386
you're like, "Hmm."

1463
00:53:46.386 --> 00:53:49.548
Just thrust your hand out, concentrating.

1464
00:53:49.548 --> 00:53:52.646
You feel the warm glow around your symbol,

1465
00:53:52.646 --> 00:53:54.875
and that warmth travels up your body to your arm,

1466
00:53:54.875 --> 00:53:56.702
and then turns very cold at the tips of your fingers

1467
00:53:56.702 --> 00:53:57.707
as you reach out. Go ahead and make

1468
00:53:57.707 --> 00:53:59.277
an attack roll with disadvantage.

1469
00:53:59.277 --> 00:54:01.230
SAM: Do it, do it, do it.

1470
00:54:01.230 --> 00:54:02.609
MATT: Adding your spell attack bonus.

1471
00:54:02.609 --> 00:54:04.484
ASHLEY: She still has disadvantage.

1472
00:54:04.484 --> 00:54:05.765
LAURA: Yeah.

1473
00:54:12.050 --> 00:54:14.314
MATT: You reach out and find nothing.

1474
00:54:14.314 --> 00:54:17.541
LAURA: God fucking-- why do I suck so hard, you guys?

1475
00:54:17.541 --> 00:54:21.541
MATT: You know, your character's pretty great

1476
00:54:21.541 --> 00:54:22.909
and you play her pretty well.

1477
00:54:22.909 --> 00:54:24.425
I don't know, for a dice mogul,

1478
00:54:24.425 --> 00:54:26.331
your dice need to be cleansed.

1479
00:54:26.331 --> 00:54:28.575
LAURA: I just-- (sighs).

1480
00:54:28.575 --> 00:54:30.612
I even went with a different choosing route this time.

1481
00:54:30.612 --> 00:54:32.201
SAM: Why did you choose a different dice?

1482
00:54:32.201 --> 00:54:34.923
TALIESIN: Bring us an old priest and a young priest.

1483
00:54:34.923 --> 00:54:37.483
An old priest and a young priest.

1484
00:54:37.483 --> 00:54:39.572
MATT: Well, Jester, as you reach out and the spell fades,

1485
00:54:39.572 --> 00:54:42.288
you still have your movement, if you'd like to,

1486
00:54:42.288 --> 00:54:44.444
or a bonus action.

1487
00:54:44.444 --> 00:54:48.033
Whatever you'd like to try.
TALIESIN: Gross.

1488
00:54:48.033 --> 00:54:49.730
LAURA: I can't tell where I am.

1489
00:54:49.730 --> 00:54:51.792
How can I use my movement to do anything?

1490
00:54:51.792 --> 00:54:53.465
I'm just going to stay where I am.

1491
00:54:53.465 --> 00:54:55.279
MATT: All right, Nott, you're up.

1492
00:54:55.279 --> 00:54:59.190
SAM: Not being able to see anything, I'm going to--

1493
00:54:59.190 --> 00:55:00.398
LAURA: Just trying to help.

1494
00:55:00.398 --> 00:55:01.508
Can't help.

1495
00:55:01.508 --> 00:55:03.348
SAM: I'm going to use my goblin muscles

1496
00:55:03.348 --> 00:55:06.245
to lift up my goblin ears and point them

1497
00:55:06.245 --> 00:55:09.959
towards the creature, trying to find

1498
00:55:09.959 --> 00:55:13.886
any sort of sound of movement or grossness.

1499
00:55:13.886 --> 00:55:17.470
MATT: Yeah, I mean, you remember where it was generally.

1500
00:55:17.470 --> 00:55:19.508
SAM: Yeah, but I'm also doing this.

1501
00:55:19.508 --> 00:55:21.624
MATT: Okay, okay.

1502
00:55:21.624 --> 00:55:24.265
SAM: The second I hear a squishy testicle,

1503
00:55:24.265 --> 00:55:26.394
I'm going to shoot at it.

1504
00:55:26.394 --> 00:55:29.179
TRAVIS: Stretchy bat wing?

1505
00:55:29.179 --> 00:55:32.579
SAM: I fire, shit, with disadvantage or advantage?

1506
00:55:32.579 --> 00:55:35.542
No, just disadvantage.
MATT: With disadvantage, I'll say.

1507
00:55:35.542 --> 00:55:37.131
SAM: All right.

1508
00:55:37.131 --> 00:55:37.964
12.

1509
00:55:39.186 --> 00:55:40.744
I assume that misses, Mr. Matthew?

1510
00:55:40.744 --> 00:55:41.815
LAURA: Yes, it does.

1511
00:55:41.815 --> 00:55:43.182
SAM: He's gone, I've lost him.

1512
00:55:43.182 --> 00:55:44.462
ASHLEY: What is he thinking about?

1513
00:55:44.462 --> 00:55:46.468
SAM: I lost him.

1514
00:55:46.468 --> 00:55:47.468
He's gone.

1515
00:55:48.712 --> 00:55:50.443
Matt is also DMing--

1516
00:55:50.443 --> 00:55:51.367
MATT: Just double-checking a few things.

1517
00:55:51.367 --> 00:55:52.392
Sorry, what was that total?

1518
00:55:52.392 --> 00:55:53.225
SAM: 12.

1519
00:55:53.225 --> 00:55:54.982
MATT: 12 misses.

1520
00:55:54.982 --> 00:55:59.270
SAM: Okay, I will reload and shoot four feet to the left.

1521
00:55:59.270 --> 00:56:00.103
MATT: Okay.

1522
00:56:02.176 --> 00:56:03.339
SAM: 22.
MATT: That hits.

1523
00:56:03.339 --> 00:56:04.256
LAURA: Ooh.
SAM: Yes.

1524
00:56:04.256 --> 00:56:05.358
TRAVIS: Yeah, get that chicken heart.

1525
00:56:05.358 --> 00:56:06.316
ASHLEY: Come on.

1526
00:56:06.316 --> 00:56:07.979
Howdy dirty dir dis.

1527
00:56:09.087 --> 00:56:09.980
SAM: Sneak attack?

1528
00:56:09.980 --> 00:56:11.213
MATT: No, because it was disadvantage on the attack.

1529
00:56:11.213 --> 00:56:13.153
SAM: Ah, you're right.

1530
00:56:13.153 --> 00:56:14.456
You're always right.

1531
00:56:14.456 --> 00:56:16.530
TRAVIS: Can't sneak up on a thing you can't see.

1532
00:56:16.530 --> 00:56:18.015
SAM: Eight points of damage.

1533
00:56:18.015 --> 00:56:19.200
MATT: Eight points of damage.

1534
00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:20.570
All right, Nott, you have your movement still,

1535
00:56:20.570 --> 00:56:21.770
would you like to move or stay put?

1536
00:56:21.770 --> 00:56:23.472
SAM: I can see right now.

1537
00:56:23.472 --> 00:56:24.305
MATT: You can.

1538
00:56:26.913 --> 00:56:30.763
SAM: As far as I know, Caleb's dying in its stomach.

1539
00:56:31.703 --> 00:56:34.158
I guess I'm just going to stand there,

1540
00:56:34.158 --> 00:56:35.337
because I don't know what's going on in there.

1541
00:56:35.337 --> 00:56:36.257
I wouldn't go in there.

1542
00:56:36.257 --> 00:56:37.648
MATT: All right, Fjord, you're up.

1543
00:56:37.648 --> 00:56:38.613
TRAVIS: All right.

1544
00:56:38.613 --> 00:56:40.296
I have advantage, but I can't see in the darkness,

1545
00:56:40.296 --> 00:56:42.002
so it's a straight roll?

1546
00:56:42.002 --> 00:56:43.302
MATT: You don't have advantage currently.

1547
00:56:43.302 --> 00:56:44.135
TRAVIS: I don't.

1548
00:56:44.135 --> 00:56:46.110
MATT: No, Yasha's turn, that ability faded,

1549
00:56:46.110 --> 00:56:47.387
so you have disadvantage.
TRAVIS: Both at disadvantage.

1550
00:56:47.387 --> 00:56:48.402
MATT: Correct.
TRAVIS: Okay, great.

1551
00:56:48.402 --> 00:56:53.326
Let's take two Eldritch Blasts into the darkness.

1552
00:56:53.326 --> 00:56:54.209
(sighs) Yeah.

1553
00:56:54.209 --> 00:56:56.515
MARISHA: I attack the darkness.

1554
00:56:56.515 --> 00:57:01.125
TRAVIS: That is a...

1555
00:57:01.125 --> 00:57:02.692
That is a 14 to hit.

1556
00:57:02.692 --> 00:57:05.843
Misses. And a, yeah.

1557
00:57:05.843 --> 00:57:06.788
MARISHA: God damn.

1558
00:57:06.788 --> 00:57:07.937
TRAVIS: 12.

1559
00:57:07.937 --> 00:57:09.076
MARISHA: God damn.

1560
00:57:09.076 --> 00:57:11.723
MATT: Both attacks just go wide.

1561
00:57:11.723 --> 00:57:13.304
You're not sure if you hit or not, you throw them in there

1562
00:57:13.304 --> 00:57:14.994
and hope they made impact.

1563
00:57:14.994 --> 00:57:19.981
You hear no sound of any reaction or screech or anything.

1564
00:57:19.981 --> 00:57:21.359
It's a little disheartening.

1565
00:57:21.359 --> 00:57:26.074
TRAVIS: I will shift 10 feet to the left.

1566
00:57:26.074 --> 00:57:27.253
MATT: All right, right there.

1567
00:57:27.253 --> 00:57:28.386
You got it.

1568
00:57:28.386 --> 00:57:31.792
Okay, it is now Obann the Punished's turn.

1569
00:57:31.792 --> 00:57:32.763
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

1570
00:57:32.763 --> 00:57:35.017
MARISHA: Maybe his thing will go away.

1571
00:57:35.017 --> 00:57:37.789
Maybe his oozing dark or whatever it's called.

1572
00:57:37.789 --> 00:57:39.527
LIAM: Maybe he'll learn the error of his ways.

1573
00:57:39.527 --> 00:57:40.819
MARISHA: Maybe. (laughs)

1574
00:57:40.819 --> 00:57:42.232
MATT: Let's see if it gets its Storm of Biting Shadow back.

1575
00:57:42.232 --> 00:57:43.932
Nope, does not.

1576
00:57:45.682 --> 00:57:48.207
Is going to, because it is enfeebled,

1577
00:57:49.483 --> 00:57:53.882
it's going to make three of its inky whip attacks again.

1578
00:57:53.882 --> 00:57:55.990
One of them's going to be at...

1579
00:57:58.179 --> 00:58:01.012
One of them's going to be Beauregard.

1580
00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:05.200
Which, because you're blinded, has advantage on the attack.

1581
00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:07.480
That'll bring it to 23.

1582
00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:08.973
MARISHA: Hits.

1583
00:58:08.973 --> 00:58:10.209
LAURA: Says who?

1584
00:58:10.209 --> 00:58:11.663
Why, though?
MARISHA: Why?

1585
00:58:12.763 --> 00:58:16.131
MATT: It would be 21 points of damage, but is reduced to 10

1586
00:58:16.131 --> 00:58:17.220
because it is enfeebled.

1587
00:58:17.220 --> 00:58:18.598
LAURA: Yay, go Caduceus!

1588
00:58:18.598 --> 00:58:21.879
TRAVIS: Oh my god, dude, oh my god.

1589
00:58:21.879 --> 00:58:22.942
LIAM: Deuces.

1590
00:58:22.942 --> 00:58:24.560
TRAVIS: Death cleric!

1591
00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:28.451
MATT: It's going to ink attack against Yasha.

1592
00:58:28.451 --> 00:58:30.028
MARISHA: So cute.

1593
00:58:30.028 --> 00:58:31.236
MATT: Natural 20.

1594
00:58:31.236 --> 00:58:32.434
(groaning)

1595
00:58:32.434 --> 00:58:33.267
ASHLEY: That hits.

1596
00:58:33.267 --> 00:58:34.897
MATT: You can't see it to--

1597
00:58:34.897 --> 00:58:36.205
TALIESIN: I can't, can I?

1598
00:58:36.205 --> 00:58:39.921
Double-checking, I can't.
ASHLEY: Can't see it, it's okay.

1599
00:58:39.921 --> 00:58:41.457
TALIESIN: But it cancels out anyway.

1600
00:58:41.457 --> 00:58:44.127
MATT: Yeah, it takes half damage. (laughs)

1601
00:58:44.127 --> 00:58:46.300
So for this, it's, oh shit.

1602
00:58:46.300 --> 00:58:47.671
TALIESIN: And it also gets halved anyway.

1603
00:58:47.671 --> 00:58:49.527
Oh, it's necrotic, doesn't get halved.
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm resistant.

1604
00:58:49.527 --> 00:58:51.143
TALIESIN: Oh, you're resistant to necrotic.

1605
00:58:51.143 --> 00:58:51.976
MATT: Yeah.

1606
00:58:51.976 --> 00:58:53.272
SAM: It's a roller coaster.

1607
00:58:53.272 --> 00:58:55.406
TALIESIN: Wow, nevermind.

1608
00:58:57.527 --> 00:59:00.689
MATT: That would be 36 reduced to--

1609
00:59:00.689 --> 00:59:03.612
TRAVIS: 28, no, 18.
MATT: To 18.

1610
00:59:05.712 --> 00:59:08.234
Reduced in half again to nine.

1611
00:59:08.234 --> 00:59:09.869
So you take nine points of necrotic damage.

1612
00:59:09.869 --> 00:59:11.481
SAM: Oh wow!
MATT: Which is bullshit!

1613
00:59:11.481 --> 00:59:15.058
LIAM: Beast.
TALIESIN and MARISHA: (nervous groans)

1614
00:59:15.058 --> 00:59:18.749
MATT: And then its final

1615
00:59:18.749 --> 00:59:20.757
lash attack is going to be at you, Jester.

1616
00:59:20.757 --> 00:59:21.713
LAURA: I knew it.

1617
00:59:21.713 --> 00:59:22.661
SAM: Here we go, here we go.

1618
00:59:22.661 --> 00:59:23.806
TALIESIN: Fine.

1619
00:59:23.806 --> 00:59:25.782
MATT: That is going to be a 26.

1620
00:59:25.782 --> 00:59:26.712
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

1621
00:59:26.712 --> 00:59:28.137
MATT: All right.

1622
00:59:28.137 --> 00:59:32.337
You take 15 points of necrotic damage.

1623
00:59:32.337 --> 00:59:34.117
TALIESIN: It rolled 30? Oh.

1624
00:59:34.117 --> 00:59:36.973
MATT: Halved to seven, because of--

1625
00:59:36.973 --> 00:59:40.056
LAURA: Okay, okay.
TALIESIN: Oh, okay.

1626
00:59:41.137 --> 00:59:43.574
MATT: And it's going to use its jagged bite attack

1627
00:59:43.574 --> 00:59:45.029
against you, Caduceus.
TALIESIN: Sure.

1628
00:59:45.029 --> 00:59:46.112
LAURA: No!

1629
00:59:48.435 --> 00:59:49.910
MATT: That's going to be a 24 to hit.

1630
00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:51.091
TALIESIN: Yeah, that hits.

1631
00:59:51.091 --> 00:59:52.191
MATT: All right.

1632
00:59:52.191 --> 00:59:56.337
TRAVIS: But you can't, because you're made of balls.

1633
00:59:56.337 --> 00:59:58.571
SAM: (laughs)

1634
00:59:58.571 --> 01:00:00.344
ASHLEY: Intimidation.

1635
01:00:00.344 --> 01:00:04.344
MARISHA: Like actual balls, like little marbles.

1636
01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:06.683
LIAM: It's the lawnmower man.

1637
01:00:06.683 --> 01:00:08.649
MARISHA: (laughs)

1638
01:00:08.649 --> 01:00:11.196
MATT: 31 points of piercing damage.

1639
01:00:11.196 --> 01:00:12.565
TALIESIN: Reduced?
MATT: Reduced to half.

1640
01:00:12.565 --> 01:00:14.619
So you take 15 points of piercing damage.

1641
01:00:14.619 --> 01:00:16.771
Make a strength saving throw for me, please.

1642
01:00:16.771 --> 01:00:17.788
TALIESIN: Strength saving throw.

1643
01:00:17.788 --> 01:00:19.374
MATT: Correct.
TALIESIN: With advantage.

1644
01:00:19.374 --> 01:00:21.712
Just thought I'd throw it out there. Nope.

1645
01:00:21.712 --> 01:00:22.545
Strength saving throw.

1646
01:00:22.545 --> 01:00:24.941
Come on, if I've ever needed a natural 20, it's right now.

1647
01:00:24.941 --> 01:00:25.828
15.

1648
01:00:25.828 --> 01:00:27.699
MATT: 15 is not enough.
TALIESIN: God fucking dammit.

1649
01:00:27.699 --> 01:00:29.114
ASHLEY: You don't add anything?

1650
01:00:29.114 --> 01:00:30.909
TALIESIN: I don't add anything to a strength saving throw.

1651
01:00:30.909 --> 01:00:33.053
LAURA: Oh no, Caduceus!
MATT: You are swallowed.

1652
01:00:33.053 --> 01:00:35.373
Not that anyone else knows.

1653
01:00:35.373 --> 01:00:38.947
The shadow fades, you all can see again,

1654
01:00:38.947 --> 01:00:40.329
and as you all begin to look around,

1655
01:00:40.329 --> 01:00:41.536
you do not see Caduceus anywhere,

1656
01:00:41.536 --> 01:00:43.668
all you see is the mouth going (slurping).

1657
01:00:43.668 --> 01:00:45.184
SAM: And Caleb is still in there,

1658
01:00:45.184 --> 01:00:46.761
and there's a giant ape in the room!

1659
01:00:46.761 --> 01:00:47.863
MARISHA: Wait, is Caduceus the ape?!

1660
01:00:47.863 --> 01:00:51.244
MATT: You guys now see a giant ape there like (roaring).

1661
01:00:51.244 --> 01:00:54.931
(yelling, laughter)

1662
01:00:54.931 --> 01:00:56.303
SAM: I know what happened.

1663
01:00:56.303 --> 01:00:58.694
Caduceus turned into the ape.

1664
01:00:58.694 --> 01:01:00.078
MARISHA: Well, that makes sense to me!

1665
01:01:00.078 --> 01:01:03.124
SAM: That makes the most sense.

1666
01:01:03.124 --> 01:01:04.961
ASHLEY: He can turn into an ape?

1667
01:01:04.961 --> 01:01:08.164
SAM: I've never seen it before.

1668
01:01:08.164 --> 01:01:10.104
MATT: The Caedogeist is going to go ahead and attack now.

1669
01:01:10.104 --> 01:01:11.979
LAURA: Oh yay, how do I want to do this!

1670
01:01:11.979 --> 01:01:14.108
TALIESIN: Caedogeist, please, please, Caedogeist, please.

1671
01:01:14.108 --> 01:01:18.449
MATT: It's going to go ahead and shift below

1672
01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:24.055
to try to hide, and then scoop up on this side.

1673
01:01:24.055 --> 01:01:25.347
Actually, going to drop darkness at this point,

1674
01:01:25.347 --> 01:01:27.352
because that's not going to help anybody, really.

1675
01:01:27.352 --> 01:01:29.409
LAURA: Oh, hi, I can see!

1676
01:01:29.409 --> 01:01:32.076
(laughter)

1677
01:01:36.189 --> 01:01:37.857
MATT: Somehow misses the first attack,

1678
01:01:37.857 --> 01:01:40.202
but does hit with the second.

1679
01:01:40.202 --> 01:01:41.740
So it does get sneak attack damage.

1680
01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:44.357
MARISHA: Howdy dirty dir dir?

1681
01:01:44.357 --> 01:01:46.151
TRAVIS: Come on.
(dice rattling)

1682
01:01:46.151 --> 01:01:47.398
LIAM: Jeez.
LAURA: That's so many.

1683
01:01:47.398 --> 01:01:49.315
ASHLEY: That's so many dices.

1684
01:01:50.436 --> 01:01:51.269
LIAM: Yahtzee.

1685
01:01:53.709 --> 01:01:55.037
TRAVIS: Jenga.

1686
01:01:55.037 --> 01:01:56.014
SAM: Is this Caedogeist?

1687
01:01:56.014 --> 01:01:57.337
LAURA: It's Caedogeist, Caedogeist.

1688
01:01:57.337 --> 01:01:58.632
ASHLEY: Big money, big money.

1689
01:01:58.632 --> 01:02:01.800
MATT: 41 points of piercing damage. It's immune to poison.

1690
01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:04.674
LAURA: Oh wow, you're right, your critical was not good,

1691
01:02:04.674 --> 01:02:06.500
if that was a regular one.

1692
01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:09.309
MATT: I rolled really shitty on that critical sneak attack.

1693
01:02:09.309 --> 01:02:14.037
It was like one, two, two, three, two, I was like, yeah.

1694
01:02:14.037 --> 01:02:17.613
So, that's Caedogeist's turn, who's starting to look

1695
01:02:17.613 --> 01:02:19.589
a little nervous now.

1696
01:02:19.589 --> 01:02:24.167
Is carving in, carving in, stabbing in. (panting)

1697
01:02:24.167 --> 01:02:25.647
Vanishing into the ground, coming back again

1698
01:02:25.647 --> 01:02:26.983
and carving again, and is looking

1699
01:02:26.983 --> 01:02:29.982
at the rest of you like, silently, come on.

1700
01:02:29.982 --> 01:02:32.096
LAURA: I totally thought he was about to die before.

1701
01:02:32.096 --> 01:02:34.130
MATT: Beauregard, you're up.

1702
01:02:34.130 --> 01:02:38.238
MARISHA: I said puke up our wizard.
MATT: Actually, at the end of Caedogeist's turn,

1703
01:02:38.238 --> 01:02:40.325
it does make a save.

1704
01:02:40.325 --> 01:02:41.850
(laughter)

1705
01:02:41.850 --> 01:02:43.619
MARISHA: Wrecking my vibe, man.

1706
01:02:43.619 --> 01:02:45.101
MATT: Sorry.
MARISHA: Heroic moment.

1707
01:02:45.101 --> 01:02:47.955
MATT: I remembered Caduceus's save
against Ray of Enfeeblement,

1708
01:02:47.955 --> 01:02:49.163
and does so.

1709
01:02:49.163 --> 01:02:50.592
TALIESIN: Saved against it?
MATT: Yes.

1710
01:02:50.592 --> 01:02:52.507
No longer enfeebled.

1711
01:02:52.507 --> 01:02:55.014
That was a 24 check on that.

1712
01:02:55.014 --> 01:02:57.026
LAURA: It's okay, you did a really good thing.

1713
01:02:57.026 --> 01:02:59.497
MATT: And at the end of the Caedogeist's turn, is going to

1714
01:02:59.497 --> 01:03:03.514
use one of its inky whips against Beauregard.

1715
01:03:03.514 --> 01:03:04.789
SAM: Oh no.

1716
01:03:06.634 --> 01:03:08.384
MATT: That is going to be a 29 to hit.

1717
01:03:08.384 --> 01:03:09.787
SAM: Yeah.

1718
01:03:09.787 --> 01:03:11.828
ASHLEY: Sheesh.

1719
01:03:11.828 --> 01:03:15.573
MATT: Beauregard takes 16 points of necrotic damage.

1720
01:03:15.573 --> 01:03:18.747
MARISHA: Oh, is that reduced, like halved or anything?

1721
01:03:18.747 --> 01:03:21.423
MATT: No, because it saved against it.

1722
01:03:21.423 --> 01:03:22.470
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

1723
01:03:22.470 --> 01:03:24.436
TRAVIS: Take that nasty plunge.

1724
01:03:25.586 --> 01:03:28.365
MARISHA: (groaning)

1725
01:03:28.365 --> 01:03:31.742
MATT: Beauregard gets whipped and yanked to the ground,

1726
01:03:31.742 --> 01:03:35.072
and is now being slowly dragged towards it.

1727
01:03:35.072 --> 01:03:36.317
LAURA: Oh god, oh god.

1728
01:03:36.317 --> 01:03:39.337
MATT: Beauregard, go ahead and make your death save.

1729
01:03:39.337 --> 01:03:40.170
SAM: Already?

1730
01:03:40.170 --> 01:03:41.447
MATT: It is Beauregard's turn now.

1731
01:03:41.447 --> 01:03:43.274
MARISHA: Again.

1732
01:03:43.274 --> 01:03:46.205
TRAVIS: What is with the fucking rollback on that thing?

1733
01:03:46.205 --> 01:03:47.958
MARISHA: It is really bad, it happens all the time.

1734
01:03:47.958 --> 01:03:49.246
TRAVIS: I mean, 15 and up and then it's like

1735
01:03:49.246 --> 01:03:50.747
no, five or less.

1736
01:03:50.747 --> 01:03:52.531
MATT: That's a failure.
LAURA: You need to get rid of it.

1737
01:03:52.531 --> 01:03:56.506
Don't go by my dice, don't go by anything that I say.

1738
01:03:56.506 --> 01:03:58.416
MATT: So one failed death save for Beauregard.

1739
01:03:58.416 --> 01:03:59.391
Caleb, your turn.

1740
01:03:59.391 --> 01:04:00.626
TRAVIS: It's crazy.

1741
01:04:00.626 --> 01:04:02.456
LIAM: Gorilla Caleb is too incensed,

1742
01:04:02.456 --> 01:04:04.176
he's just whaling on the thing.

1743
01:04:04.176 --> 01:04:08.964
So first monkey strike is very low and does not hit.

1744
01:04:08.964 --> 01:04:11.265
That's, oh, yeah, it's an 11, does not hit.

1745
01:04:11.265 --> 01:04:12.195
MATT: Does not hit.

1746
01:04:12.195 --> 01:04:13.482
LIAM: Second one does, it's a 25.

1747
01:04:13.482 --> 01:04:14.909
MATT: That does hit.

1748
01:04:14.909 --> 01:04:18.292
LIAM: So that is 3d10 plus six.

1749
01:04:22.269 --> 01:04:27.269
Oh, good, 18, 23, 31 points of bludgeoning damage.

1750
01:04:27.399 --> 01:04:31.466
MATT: 31 points of bludgeoning damage, nice.

1751
01:04:31.466 --> 01:04:33.927
As the first one swing and miss, the second one

1752
01:04:33.927 --> 01:04:35.818
you slam into it and parts of it are splattering,

1753
01:04:35.818 --> 01:04:38.140
you grab with your big monkey fist and tear away,

1754
01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:41.467
and as you throw down chunks of its weird,

1755
01:04:41.467 --> 01:04:45.237
lightly corporeal flesh splatters into the ground

1756
01:04:45.237 --> 01:04:46.916
and turns into just a tar-like liquid.

1757
01:04:46.916 --> 01:04:50.534
It's sticky in your fingers and the anger wells up in you.

1758
01:04:50.534 --> 01:04:51.557
That finishes your turn?

1759
01:04:51.557 --> 01:04:53.115
LIAM: Yeah, I stay right at it.

1760
01:04:53.115 --> 01:04:54.181
MATT: End of Caleb's turn, it's going to go ahead and use

1761
01:04:54.181 --> 01:04:56.786
another inky whip attack.

1762
01:04:56.786 --> 01:05:01.786
This is going to be against Jester,

1763
01:05:01.872 --> 01:05:05.455
because Yasha just shrugged that off.

1764
01:05:07.885 --> 01:05:08.876
14.

1765
01:05:08.876 --> 01:05:09.884
LAURA: Yes!

1766
01:05:09.884 --> 01:05:11.634
TALIESIN: Thank fuck.

1767
01:05:12.674 --> 01:05:13.947
Keep the healer up, please.

1768
01:05:13.947 --> 01:05:15.372
MATT: Caduceus.

1769
01:05:15.372 --> 01:05:16.791
Beginning of your turn?
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

1770
01:05:16.791 --> 01:05:17.624
MATT: Okay.

1771
01:05:18.752 --> 01:05:21.318
TALIESIN: So, can I cast...

1772
01:05:23.693 --> 01:05:25.393
(sighs)

1773
01:05:26.542 --> 01:05:27.609
Fuck.

1774
01:05:33.798 --> 01:05:36.636
So I don't entirely know what to do here.

1775
01:05:36.636 --> 01:05:38.236
I'm going to...

1776
01:05:40.733 --> 01:05:42.582
MATT: You can feel thousands and thousands

1777
01:05:42.582 --> 01:05:44.851
of tiny teeth tearing across your body.

1778
01:05:44.851 --> 01:05:47.587
TALIESIN: Tearing across my body, okay.

1779
01:05:47.587 --> 01:05:49.562
LAURA: (laughs)

1780
01:05:49.562 --> 01:05:51.248
Hmm, yes, tearing across my body.

1781
01:05:51.248 --> 01:05:54.648
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast--

1782
01:05:54.648 --> 01:05:57.289
oh, hello, hello, this is interesting.

1783
01:05:59.154 --> 01:06:03.304
I'm going to cast Vampiric Touch.

1784
01:06:04.350 --> 01:06:05.414
MATT: Okay.

1785
01:06:05.414 --> 01:06:06.806
TRAVIS: Ooh, that could be cool.

1786
01:06:06.806 --> 01:06:08.217
MATT: So go ahead and make the attack roll

1787
01:06:08.217 --> 01:06:09.745
with your spell attack modifier.

1788
01:06:09.745 --> 01:06:12.737
You have disadvantage, because you are restrained within it.

1789
01:06:16.112 --> 01:06:17.823
TALIESIN: Can I even cast Vampiric Touch?

1790
01:06:17.823 --> 01:06:18.656
Yes I can.

1791
01:06:19.989 --> 01:06:22.043
Okay, come on, let's roll well,

1792
01:06:22.043 --> 01:06:24.876
because this would suck if I don't.

1793
01:06:30.538 --> 01:06:31.818
12.

1794
01:06:31.818 --> 01:06:33.543
MATT: 12 misses.

1795
01:06:33.543 --> 01:06:36.120
You try and reach out, and as you put forward,

1796
01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:38.641
it seems like the mouth around opens up

1797
01:06:38.641 --> 01:06:42.539
and makes space for the hand, and you make contact,

1798
01:06:42.539 --> 01:06:44.923
but the spell doesn't seem to take.

1799
01:06:46.414 --> 01:06:47.986
TALIESIN: Okay.

1800
01:06:47.986 --> 01:06:51.159
I can't take a bonus action to do anything really in here.

1801
01:06:51.159 --> 01:06:52.941
MATT: I mean, unless it's a cantrip.

1802
01:06:52.941 --> 01:06:54.153
TALIESIN: Unless it's a cantrip?

1803
01:06:54.153 --> 01:06:55.342
MATT: And you can see.

1804
01:06:55.342 --> 01:06:58.473
LAURA: There's no bonus action cantrips.

1805
01:06:58.473 --> 01:07:02.251
TALIESIN: I'm going to give myself, in that case--

1806
01:07:02.251 --> 01:07:03.918
Nope, there's not.

1807
01:07:04.918 --> 01:07:06.297
(sighs)

1808
01:07:06.297 --> 01:07:11.188
No, I can't do that either, because, yep, nope, nope,

1809
01:07:11.188 --> 01:07:13.209
because I can't do that, nevermind, I got nothing.

1810
01:07:13.209 --> 01:07:14.770
MATT: Yasha, you're up.

1811
01:07:14.770 --> 01:07:15.603
Jester, you're on deck.

1812
01:07:15.603 --> 01:07:17.260
TALIESIN: No, that's not a bonus action.

1813
01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:18.158
ASHLEY: Okay.

1814
01:07:18.158 --> 01:07:19.404
MATT: Actually, at the end of Caduceus's turn,

1815
01:07:19.404 --> 01:07:22.061
it's going to use its last inky whip attack,

1816
01:07:24.186 --> 01:07:25.677
and this is going to be at Jester.

1817
01:07:26.529 --> 01:07:28.571
TALIESIN: God fucking dammit.
ASHLEY: Why? I'm right there.

1818
01:07:28.571 --> 01:07:29.613
MATT: 17 to hit.

1819
01:07:29.613 --> 01:07:30.446
LAURA: 19.

1820
01:07:30.446 --> 01:07:33.593
SAM: She's so strong, with her shield?

1821
01:07:33.593 --> 01:07:35.093
LAURA: Thank you, Pumat!

1822
01:07:36.871 --> 01:07:38.213
SAM: I'm dying!

1823
01:07:38.213 --> 01:07:40.684
(laughter)

1824
01:07:40.684 --> 01:07:42.451
SAM: Help me!

1825
01:07:42.451 --> 01:07:43.825
ASHLEY: Break this down for me again.

1826
01:07:43.825 --> 01:07:45.813
Beau is being pulled towards it?

1827
01:07:45.813 --> 01:07:47.429
MATT: Yeah.
LIAM: Yes, and is unconscious.

1828
01:07:47.429 --> 01:07:51.105
ASHLEY: Okay, so can I try,

1829
01:07:51.105 --> 01:07:53.563
I'd like to try to cut off

1830
01:07:53.563 --> 01:07:56.454
whatever is pulling her towards--

1831
01:07:56.454 --> 01:07:58.365
MATT: I will say it's more narrative.

1832
01:07:58.365 --> 01:08:01.479
Beauregard is unconscious, so

1833
01:08:01.479 --> 01:08:03.072
if you want to try and grab Beauregard

1834
01:08:03.072 --> 01:08:04.074
and take her far away from it,

1835
01:08:04.074 --> 01:08:06.525
it's like an action to grab and move

1836
01:08:06.525 --> 01:08:08.018
half her movement and get her away, then you can do that.

1837
01:08:08.018 --> 01:08:10.285
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'm going-- say again?

1838
01:08:10.285 --> 01:08:11.118
TRAVIS: Can you heal?

1839
01:08:11.118 --> 01:08:13.111
ASHLEY: I already used it.
MATT: Already used it.

1840
01:08:13.111 --> 01:08:17.544
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'm going to turn, look at Beau,

1841
01:08:18.432 --> 01:08:20.673
and I'm going to pick her up and take her

1842
01:08:20.673 --> 01:08:21.945
into that spot right there.

1843
01:08:21.945 --> 01:08:22.778
MATT: This spot here?
ASHLEY: Yep.

1844
01:08:22.778 --> 01:08:23.953
MATT: Okay.

1845
01:08:23.953 --> 01:08:26.299
ASHLEY: Just a little bit, so when she comes to, she--

1846
01:08:26.299 --> 01:08:29.822
MATT: You pull Beauregard out of the range into that space.

1847
01:08:29.822 --> 01:08:32.592
As you do, it takes an attack of opportunity against you.

1848
01:08:32.592 --> 01:08:35.429
LAURA: Against Yasha, that's good.

1849
01:08:35.429 --> 01:08:36.429
MATT: 29 to hit.

1850
01:08:37.663 --> 01:08:38.496
ASHLEY: Yeah.

1851
01:08:39.575 --> 01:08:40.750
It's fine.

1852
01:08:42.048 --> 01:08:43.940
SAM: You're not even awake to see this romantic gesture.

1853
01:08:43.940 --> 01:08:45.619
MATT: 20 points of necrotic damage reduced to 10,

1854
01:08:45.619 --> 01:08:48.000
so you take 10 points of necrotic damage.

1855
01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.733
ASHLEY: Okay, and then, can I,

1856
01:08:51.733 --> 01:08:56.574
as a bonus action...

1857
01:09:00.182 --> 01:09:05.182
Can he understand anything, what we're saying?

1858
01:09:05.696 --> 01:09:06.964
MATT: You have no idea.

1859
01:09:06.964 --> 01:09:07.797
ASHLEY: Okay, so--

1860
01:09:07.797 --> 01:09:09.231
MATT: You've never sene this creature before.

1861
01:09:09.231 --> 01:09:12.676
There's no sign of anything Obann-esque anymore.

1862
01:09:12.676 --> 01:09:14.302
Whatever this is, it is terrible.

1863
01:09:14.302 --> 01:09:18.548
ASHLEY: I'm just going to try
screaming out in Abyssal: Drop it!

1864
01:09:18.548 --> 01:09:20.890
MATT: Okay.
ASHLEY: Drop it!

1865
01:09:20.890 --> 01:09:22.011
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

1866
01:09:22.011 --> 01:09:23.031
SAM: As if to a dog?

1867
01:09:23.031 --> 01:09:24.448
ASHLEY: As if to a dog.

1868
01:09:26.903 --> 01:09:28.250
Oh.

1869
01:09:28.250 --> 01:09:29.204
Ew.

1870
01:09:29.204 --> 01:09:30.561
Nope.

1871
01:09:30.561 --> 01:09:31.511
Nothing.

1872
01:09:31.511 --> 01:09:33.658
MATT: You shout out into the room.

1873
01:09:33.658 --> 01:09:37.098
You gather the creature, either it's engrossed otherwise,

1874
01:09:37.098 --> 01:09:39.899
or it lacks the intelligence or the care

1875
01:09:39.899 --> 01:09:41.269
to acknowledge what you shouted.

1876
01:09:41.269 --> 01:09:42.570
ASHLEY: Okay.

1877
01:09:42.570 --> 01:09:45.919
MATT: All right, Yasha's turn's over, Jester, you're up.

1878
01:09:45.919 --> 01:09:47.219
LAURA: Okay.

1879
01:09:48.709 --> 01:09:50.502
MATT: With Nott on deck.

1880
01:09:50.502 --> 01:09:53.585
TALIESIN: So you can get away from this, but.

1881
01:09:54.555 --> 01:09:59.555
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to, well this is so difficult.

1882
01:09:59.711 --> 01:10:02.037
TALIESIN: Unless he spits me out, I'm kind of fucked.

1883
01:10:02.037 --> 01:10:05.258
LAURA: Do people have healing potions?

1884
01:10:05.258 --> 01:10:06.637
SAM: I got this.

1885
01:10:06.637 --> 01:10:09.567
LAURA: I'm going to use Command.

1886
01:10:09.567 --> 01:10:10.947
MATT: Okay.

1887
01:10:10.947 --> 01:10:14.247
LAURA: On it, and I'm going to say:

1888
01:10:15.230 --> 01:10:16.805
Vomit!

1889
01:10:16.805 --> 01:10:17.780
SAM: Vomit?

1890
01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:20.863
Excellent choice, Jester.
LAURA: Thank you.

1891
01:10:22.788 --> 01:10:25.347
And then I'm going to back up.

1892
01:10:27.917 --> 01:10:29.316
MATT: Sure.

1893
01:10:29.316 --> 01:10:30.517
That's fun.

1894
01:10:30.517 --> 01:10:32.093
All right, what's the DC on the spell?

1895
01:10:32.093 --> 01:10:33.310
LAURA: 17 wisdom.

1896
01:10:33.310 --> 01:10:34.535
MATT: 17 wisdom.

1897
01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:37.043
MATT: Natural 18.

1898
01:10:37.911 --> 01:10:40.335
23, I'm sorry.
LAURA: Okay.

1899
01:10:40.335 --> 01:10:41.737
TRAVIS: That's our luck.

1900
01:10:41.737 --> 01:10:44.239
MATT: As you shout the word out to it, in a similar way

1901
01:10:44.239 --> 01:10:46.630
as to Yasha's previous yell, it seems

1902
01:10:46.630 --> 01:10:48.875
that whatever intelligence lies within there

1903
01:10:48.875 --> 01:10:51.299
has been shattered into 1,000 pieces,

1904
01:10:51.299 --> 01:10:55.092
and it is only driven to eat and destroy.

1905
01:10:55.092 --> 01:10:56.392
TALIESIN: (sighs)

1906
01:10:56.392 --> 01:10:57.692
LAURA: Okay.

1907
01:10:57.692 --> 01:11:00.517
Then I'm going to--
TALIESIN: Fuck.

1908
01:11:01.624 --> 01:11:05.768
LAURA: I'm going to run around it.

1909
01:11:05.768 --> 01:11:09.467
And get on the other side and see if I can

1910
01:11:09.467 --> 01:11:12.541
block the doorway to keep Beau safe.

1911
01:11:12.541 --> 01:11:14.034
MATT: Okay.

1912
01:11:14.034 --> 01:11:15.853
That finishes your turn, Jester, Nott, you're up.

1913
01:11:15.853 --> 01:11:16.686
SAM: Okay.

1914
01:11:18.172 --> 01:11:20.947
Wow, this is just insane.

1915
01:11:23.511 --> 01:11:24.940
This is just insane.

1916
01:11:24.940 --> 01:11:27.341
Am I 30 feet or more away?

1917
01:11:27.341 --> 01:11:29.632
MATT: You are not; you are 25 feet from it.

1918
01:11:29.632 --> 01:11:30.465
SAM: Okay.

1919
01:11:32.422 --> 01:11:34.643
Boy, I mean, I'm going to do what I do:

1920
01:11:34.643 --> 01:11:37.951
I'm going to fire a crossbow bolt.

1921
01:11:37.951 --> 01:11:38.951
MATT: Go for it.

1922
01:11:40.452 --> 01:11:42.300
SAM: 20 to hit.
MATT: That hits.

1923
01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:44.632
SAM: With the sneakies?

1924
01:11:44.632 --> 01:11:45.992
MATT: With sneak attack damage, yeah.

1925
01:11:45.992 --> 01:11:47.249
SAM: Yeah.

1926
01:11:47.249 --> 01:11:48.323
TRAVIS: Come on.

1927
01:11:48.323 --> 01:11:49.300
Come on, now.

1928
01:11:49.300 --> 01:11:50.400
SAM: Come on, now, get 'er.

1929
01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:51.745
LAURA: Come now, kill it, kill it!
TRAVIS: (auctioneer patter)

1930
01:11:51.745 --> 01:11:52.903
SAM: Lotta threes, lotta threes.

1931
01:11:52.903 --> 01:11:55.012
LAURA: That's okay, you got a six.

1932
01:11:55.012 --> 01:11:56.886
LIAM: It's got to happen eventually. Hurty dirty.

1933
01:11:56.886 --> 01:11:58.604
TRAVIS: Can I get a 675, 75, 675.

1934
01:11:58.604 --> 01:12:00.437
SAM: 27 points of damage.

1935
01:12:01.854 --> 01:12:04.173
MATT: All righty.

1936
01:12:04.173 --> 01:12:05.131
SAM: That didn't do it.

1937
01:12:05.131 --> 01:12:06.434
MARISHA: (groans)

1938
01:12:06.434 --> 01:12:08.730
SAM: Is Beau out? I can't--

1939
01:12:08.730 --> 01:12:10.813
MATT: Beau is out. Yasha dragged her.

1940
01:12:11.735 --> 01:12:13.203
TALIESIN: But Beau's unconscious.

1941
01:12:13.203 --> 01:12:15.004
LAURA: Beau's unconscious.

1942
01:12:15.004 --> 01:12:17.455
SAM: And Yasha has no way of healing her?

1943
01:12:17.455 --> 01:12:18.847
TRAVIS: And Beau and Yasha are in the hallway?

1944
01:12:18.847 --> 01:12:19.891
MATT: Correct.

1945
01:12:19.891 --> 01:12:21.629
TALIESIN: Fuck, yeah.

1946
01:12:21.629 --> 01:12:24.862
LAURA: Caduceus is inside of it.

1947
01:12:26.251 --> 01:12:27.766
I tried.

1948
01:12:27.766 --> 01:12:29.040
ASHLEY: We're both--

1949
01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:31.897
SAM: But Yasha has no way of healing Beau.

1950
01:12:31.897 --> 01:12:36.897
ASHLEY: Nope, I already used my
Healing Hands on her earlier.

1951
01:12:37.093 --> 01:12:39.146
MARISHA: (laughs)

1952
01:12:39.146 --> 01:12:40.479
SAM: You're nearby.

1953
01:12:42.083 --> 01:12:42.916
Ish.

1954
01:12:44.383 --> 01:12:46.823
LAURA: You used one save?

1955
01:12:46.823 --> 01:12:48.772
MARISHA: Yes, I've lost it.

1956
01:12:48.772 --> 01:12:49.845
SAM: You're nearby.

1957
01:12:49.845 --> 01:12:51.428
LAURA: Yeah, why?

1958
01:12:51.428 --> 01:12:53.316
SAM: You're coming up.

1959
01:12:53.316 --> 01:12:54.418
TALIESIN: No.

1960
01:12:54.418 --> 01:12:56.783
LAURA: I'm not, I mean, it's going to be a while.

1961
01:12:56.783 --> 01:12:59.540
SAM: All right, then I will use my movement

1962
01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:04.174
to dash towards Yasha and the escaping Beauregard.

1963
01:13:04.174 --> 01:13:07.338
MARISHA: I'm not escaping. I'm escaping <i>life</i>.

1964
01:13:07.338 --> 01:13:10.041
SAM: Sorry, the cowardly Beauregard.

1965
01:13:10.041 --> 01:13:12.466
(laughter)

1966
01:13:12.466 --> 01:13:13.644
TRAVIS: You're getting medevaced.

1967
01:13:13.644 --> 01:13:15.175
MARISHA: Oh, jesus.

1968
01:13:15.175 --> 01:13:20.063
SAM: I will dash to them.

1969
01:13:20.063 --> 01:13:21.879
MATT: You will dash, okay.

1970
01:13:21.879 --> 01:13:24.573
You will take an attack of opportunity.

1971
01:13:24.573 --> 01:13:25.684
TALIESIN: No, he already used his reaction.

1972
01:13:25.684 --> 01:13:26.892
LAURA: On Yasha.
MATT: Oh, that's right, he did.

1973
01:13:26.892 --> 01:13:28.544
Yeah, so.

1974
01:13:29.757 --> 01:13:32.505
SAM: I will ready my potion, but can't quite use it yet.

1975
01:13:32.505 --> 01:13:33.683
MATT: You got it.

1976
01:13:33.683 --> 01:13:35.180
Fjord, you're up.

1977
01:13:35.180 --> 01:13:37.151
SAM: Want it, you want it?

1978
01:13:37.151 --> 01:13:42.151
TRAVIS: I will run forward my 30 feet,
up towards the inky shit.

1979
01:13:43.111 --> 01:13:44.085
MATT: Puts you right there.

1980
01:13:44.085 --> 01:13:45.566
TRAVIS: So I'm out of melee, right?

1981
01:13:45.566 --> 01:13:47.071
MATT: You're out of melee, you're standing on

1982
01:13:47.071 --> 01:13:50.088
one of the ritual sigils with the red carvings

1983
01:13:50.088 --> 01:13:51.974
and drawings on the ground, and

1984
01:13:51.974 --> 01:13:54.600
even though Obann is gone, the ritual's still present,

1985
01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:56.465
and it gives you this weird like,

1986
01:13:56.465 --> 01:13:59.371
shooting of cold energy through your body.

1987
01:13:59.371 --> 01:14:01.010
TRAVIS: Can I take one step to see,

1988
01:14:01.010 --> 01:14:04.210
and then step out of it, out of habit?

1989
01:14:04.210 --> 01:14:07.493
And I'll look at it like Tommy Lee Jones in Men in Black

1990
01:14:07.493 --> 01:14:10.275
and be like: Eat me, you piece of shit!

1991
01:14:10.275 --> 01:14:14.560
You're a taint smear of Tharizdun's crotch, let's go!

1992
01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:17.685
And I'll fire two shots of Eldritch Blast.

1993
01:14:17.685 --> 01:14:18.518
MATT: Go for it.

1994
01:14:18.518 --> 01:14:20.305
LAURA: I think the Texan accent came back on that one.

1995
01:14:20.305 --> 01:14:21.843
MATT: Yeah, a little bit, a little bit.

1996
01:14:21.843 --> 01:14:23.355
TRAVIS: It might've.
MATT: Force of habit.

1997
01:14:23.355 --> 01:14:25.837
LIAM: Had to put a little spin on that one.

1998
01:14:25.837 --> 01:14:29.866
TRAVIS: That is a 24 and a 15.

1999
01:14:29.866 --> 01:14:31.170
MATT: Both hit.

2000
01:14:31.170 --> 01:14:32.128
TRAVIS: Oh.

2001
01:14:32.128 --> 01:14:33.586
Beautiful.

2002
01:14:33.586 --> 01:14:35.678
SAM: Oh no.
ASHLEY: Come on.

2003
01:14:35.678 --> 01:14:37.067
LAURA: Mm-mm, mm-mm.

2004
01:14:37.067 --> 01:14:38.838
SAM: Nothing, I just realized--
LAURA: What? Tell me.

2005
01:14:38.838 --> 01:14:40.541
SAM: -- bad things that could happen.

2006
01:14:40.541 --> 01:14:43.160
TRAVIS: That is 12 points of force damage

2007
01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:48.160
and 11 points of force damage, so 23 points of force damage.

2008
01:14:52.141 --> 01:14:56.367
MATT: You fire both into it, you see it's like (dripping),

2009
01:14:56.367 --> 01:14:57.905
parts of it are falling onto the ground,

2010
01:14:57.905 --> 01:15:00.285
it's trying to create more mass within it,

2011
01:15:00.285 --> 01:15:01.967
but the shadow continues to fall.

2012
01:15:01.967 --> 01:15:04.830
It is so close to fucking dying.

2013
01:15:04.830 --> 01:15:05.771
MARISHA: You almost had it.

2014
01:15:05.771 --> 01:15:07.112
You almost had it!

2015
01:15:07.112 --> 01:15:10.702
It was like one or two.

2016
01:15:10.702 --> 01:15:12.598
MATT: And it's his turn.

2017
01:15:12.598 --> 01:15:15.672
TRAVIS: I yelled at it. I called it a taint smear.

2018
01:15:15.672 --> 01:15:18.261
MATT: It gets its Storm of Biting Shadow back.

2019
01:15:18.261 --> 01:15:20.360
LAURA: Oh, fuck, y'all, this is it,

2020
01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:22.918
we could fucking die right now.

2021
01:15:22.918 --> 01:15:24.150
ASHLEY: Wait, it gets its what?

2022
01:15:24.150 --> 01:15:26.451
MARISHA: Oh no.
MATT: All right.

2023
01:15:26.451 --> 01:15:27.284
So.

2024
01:15:29.470 --> 01:15:31.084
Roll the damage first.

2025
01:15:31.084 --> 01:15:32.850
SAM: Oh no.

2026
01:15:34.904 --> 01:15:36.673
Oh bad, oh bad.

2027
01:15:36.673 --> 01:15:38.365
LAURA: I got Revivify, but if I go down.

2028
01:15:38.365 --> 01:15:40.506
TALIESIN: You're going to go down.
SAM: She can't.

2029
01:15:40.506 --> 01:15:41.598
MATT: Okay.

2030
01:15:41.598 --> 01:15:45.831
So, against you, Fjord, 29.

2031
01:15:45.831 --> 01:15:46.664
MARISHA: Oh yeah.

2032
01:15:46.664 --> 01:15:47.497
TRAVIS: Hit.

2033
01:15:47.497 --> 01:15:50.288
MATT: 29, you take 21 points of necrotic damage.

2034
01:15:50.288 --> 01:15:51.879
TALIESIN: Okay, could be worse.

2035
01:15:51.879 --> 01:15:53.262
Oh no, you'll get hit.

2036
01:15:53.262 --> 01:15:54.797
MATT: And you are weakened.

2037
01:15:54.797 --> 01:15:56.044
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

2038
01:15:56.044 --> 01:15:58.480
MATT: Beauregard, you fail another death save.

2039
01:15:58.480 --> 01:15:59.488
MARISHA: Just one?

2040
01:15:59.488 --> 01:16:00.610
MATT: It's not a melee attack.

2041
01:16:00.610 --> 01:16:02.292
LAURA: Thank god, thank god, thank god.

2042
01:16:02.292 --> 01:16:03.293
MARISHA: Oh, that's right.

2043
01:16:03.293 --> 01:16:05.103
MATT: If it's within five feet of you, it's a critical hit,

2044
01:16:05.103 --> 01:16:07.586
in which case it does two death saves.

2045
01:16:07.586 --> 01:16:11.025
You, that is a 16 to hit. What's your...? Hits,

2046
01:16:11.025 --> 01:16:12.304
you take another 21 points of necrotic damage

2047
01:16:12.304 --> 01:16:13.560
and your attacks are halved.

2048
01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:15.346
Your strength-based attacks, or no, all your attacks

2049
01:16:15.346 --> 01:16:17.778
that are weapon-based are half damage.

2050
01:16:17.778 --> 01:16:19.594
Nott.

2051
01:16:19.594 --> 01:16:22.809
29 to hit. You take 21 points of necrotic damage.

2052
01:16:22.809 --> 01:16:25.584
SAM: Do I get to, like, evade or anything?

2053
01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:28.378
MATT: It is a weapon attack. You can use your reaction

2054
01:16:28.378 --> 01:16:29.836
and take half damage, if you'd like.

2055
01:16:29.836 --> 01:16:31.758
SAM: I will do that.
MATT: All right.

2056
01:16:31.758 --> 01:16:32.591
Jester.

2057
01:16:33.698 --> 01:16:37.481
That is a 19 to hit.
LAURA: 19.

2058
01:16:37.481 --> 01:16:38.915
MATT: So you take 21 points of necrotic damage.

2059
01:16:38.915 --> 01:16:41.405
LAURA: I'm unconscious.
SAM: Oh.

2060
01:16:41.405 --> 01:16:42.402
Oh.

2061
01:16:42.402 --> 01:16:43.309
ASHLEY: Dammit.

2062
01:16:43.309 --> 01:16:46.226
MATT: Jester falls, the illusion fades.

2063
01:16:47.511 --> 01:16:48.689
SAM: Is that real Jester?

2064
01:16:48.689 --> 01:16:49.564
MATT: Real Jester

2065
01:16:49.564 --> 01:16:50.397
falls.

2066
01:16:51.505 --> 01:16:52.502
ASHLEY: This is bad.

2067
01:16:52.502 --> 01:16:53.366
SAM: This is bad.

2068
01:16:53.366 --> 01:16:54.826
LAURA: And Caduceus is inside of it.

2069
01:16:54.826 --> 01:16:56.482
MATT: Caduceus is inside, so Caduceus is unaffected.

2070
01:16:56.482 --> 01:16:59.315
Yasha, natural 20.

2071
01:16:59.315 --> 01:17:00.873
ASHLEY: Okay.

2072
01:17:00.873 --> 01:17:05.093
MATT: So that would be, how many dice did I roll there?

2073
01:17:05.093 --> 01:17:07.327
22, 21, I said it was 21?
LIAM: 21.

2074
01:17:07.327 --> 01:17:08.743
MARISHA: I was literally just talking about

2075
01:17:08.743 --> 01:17:10.873
how I don't have a backup character anymore.

2076
01:17:10.873 --> 01:17:12.127
TRAVIS: Shush, shh!

2077
01:17:12.127 --> 01:17:14.309
MATT: 36 points of necrotic damage reduced to half.

2078
01:17:14.309 --> 01:17:19.309
MARISHA: Ow, ow, ow. (laughter)

2079
01:17:19.554 --> 01:17:20.555
ASHLEY: Did you say 36?

2080
01:17:20.555 --> 01:17:21.708
MATT: 36, so yes, it would be 18.

2081
01:17:21.708 --> 01:17:23.507
So you take 18 points of necrotic damage.

2082
01:17:23.507 --> 01:17:26.842
And all your attacks do half damage too.

2083
01:17:26.842 --> 01:17:28.949
ASHLEY: All of my attacks towards him take half damage.

2084
01:17:28.949 --> 01:17:31.451
MATT: Do half damage.
ASHLEY: Do half damage, okay.

2085
01:17:31.451 --> 01:17:32.543
MATT: Okay.

2086
01:17:32.543 --> 01:17:36.840
That's going to finish his turn.

2087
01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:39.559
Caedogeist is going to attack.

2088
01:17:39.559 --> 01:17:40.768
ASHLEY: Come on, come on!

2089
01:17:40.768 --> 01:17:42.758
TALIESIN: Yeah, you are, aren't you?
MARISHA: Get the how do dur do dur do dis?

2090
01:17:42.758 --> 01:17:44.125
MATT: I really don't want to do this.

2091
01:17:44.125 --> 01:17:47.036
LAURA: Yes, you do! Just do it! Just kill it!

2092
01:17:47.036 --> 01:17:48.603
TRAVIS: Come on, come on.

2093
01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:51.789
MATT: That's 25 to hit.
TRAVIS: Come on.

2094
01:17:51.789 --> 01:17:53.672
MATT: But it's not a sneak attack, because--

2095
01:17:53.672 --> 01:17:54.859
LAURA: Everybody's dead.

2096
01:17:54.859 --> 01:17:55.893
MATT: Everybody's dead from it.

2097
01:17:55.893 --> 01:17:57.015
LAURA: Although Caleb, Caleb.

2098
01:17:57.015 --> 01:17:59.213
LIAM: The giant gorilla is engaged with it.

2099
01:17:59.213 --> 01:18:00.708
LAURA: 10 feet reach.

2100
01:18:02.066 --> 01:18:04.117
MATT: Technically, yeah, 10 feet.

2101
01:18:04.117 --> 01:18:04.950
Yeah, yeah.
LIAM: He also would've,

2102
01:18:04.950 --> 01:18:06.533
he's not going from far away,

2103
01:18:06.533 --> 01:18:07.483
he's on top of it.

2104
01:18:07.483 --> 01:18:09.808
MATT: That's true, that's true. I'll allow it.

2105
01:18:09.808 --> 01:18:12.658
SAM: Matt's going to kill one of his own characters.

2106
01:18:12.658 --> 01:18:13.491
TRAVIS: Come on.

2107
01:18:13.491 --> 01:18:15.448
TALIESIN: I'm glad we shamed you into this.

2108
01:18:15.448 --> 01:18:16.564
TRAVIS: Say it.
LAURA: Yes!

2109
01:18:16.564 --> 01:18:18.364
TALIESIN: Say it, say it, say it!

2110
01:18:20.264 --> 01:18:21.105
MATT: How do I want to do this?

2111
01:18:21.105 --> 01:18:25.021
(cheering and laughter)

2112
01:18:25.021 --> 01:18:25.912
TALIESIN: Friendship!

2113
01:18:25.912 --> 01:18:27.357
Friendship!

2114
01:18:27.357 --> 01:18:29.598
It was killed with the power of friendship!

2115
01:18:29.598 --> 01:18:31.006
MATT: That is the dumbest...

2116
01:18:31.006 --> 01:18:34.005
(laughter, applause)

2117
01:18:34.005 --> 01:18:36.331
TRAVIS: Yeah!
LAURA: I'm so proud of you!

2118
01:18:36.331 --> 01:18:38.081
ASHLEY: You did it!

2119
01:18:40.095 --> 01:18:42.973
SAM: Matt, please describe how
you would like to kill yourself.

2120
01:18:42.973 --> 01:18:44.483
(laughter)

2121
01:18:44.483 --> 01:18:45.842
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

2122
01:18:46.910 --> 01:18:49.032
MATT: As the creature itself is pulling itself

2123
01:18:49.032 --> 01:18:50.332
towards the doorway, as everyone's

2124
01:18:50.332 --> 01:18:53.174
trying to find its way around, you watch tendrils (slurping)

2125
01:18:53.174 --> 01:18:55.607
pulling and dragging its form in almost like a weird

2126
01:18:55.607 --> 01:18:58.601
rolling ball of black inkiness.

2127
01:18:58.601 --> 01:19:00.274
As it makes its way that direction,

2128
01:19:00.274 --> 01:19:03.270
Caduceus inside being torn by the teeth that grind,

2129
01:19:03.270 --> 01:19:05.156
everyone else knocked unconscious on the ground,

2130
01:19:05.156 --> 01:19:08.833
eyes rolled back, mouths open, barely breathing,

2131
01:19:08.833 --> 01:19:11.361
you watch as the Caedogeist vanishes

2132
01:19:11.361 --> 01:19:12.874
into the ground.

2133
01:19:14.458 --> 01:19:17.885
As it pulls forward. (slurping)

2134
01:19:17.885 --> 01:19:21.415
It explodes from the inside, Caduceus rolls out

2135
01:19:21.415 --> 01:19:23.714
onto the ground, covered in the black ichor,

2136
01:19:23.714 --> 01:19:25.510
and there where it was standing you see the Caedogeist

2137
01:19:25.510 --> 01:19:28.519
holding both blades out, had phased up into it

2138
01:19:28.519 --> 01:19:31.391
and burst through from the inside, carving it apart

2139
01:19:31.391 --> 01:19:32.535
into multiple places.

2140
01:19:32.535 --> 01:19:35.910
TALIESIN: I immediately stand up and

2141
01:19:35.910 --> 01:19:38.379
bonus action Mass Healing Word,

2142
01:19:38.379 --> 01:19:39.740
the second I can.

2143
01:19:39.740 --> 01:19:44.093
MATT: Okay, we'll come to your turn,
which'll be in a second.

2144
01:19:44.093 --> 01:19:46.725
Beauregard, your turn comes up first, next.

2145
01:19:46.725 --> 01:19:47.630
LAURA: Oh, jeez.

2146
01:19:47.630 --> 01:19:49.308
MATT: Go ahead and make a death save.

2147
01:19:49.308 --> 01:19:50.141
LAURA: Right.

2148
01:19:50.141 --> 01:19:51.464
MARISHA: We're still in initiative?

2149
01:19:51.464 --> 01:19:53.530
MATT: You would be up next.
TRAVIS: Wait, wait, are those two failures?

2150
01:19:53.530 --> 01:19:55.956
LIAM: Yeah, so one roll.
LAURA: That's okay, that's okay.

2151
01:19:55.956 --> 01:19:58.084
You're going to do good, you're going to roll 20.

2152
01:19:58.084 --> 01:19:59.431
You're going to roll a 20.

2153
01:19:59.431 --> 01:20:01.495
MARISHA: I don't trust that one.
TRAVIS: Remember what you said.

2154
01:20:01.495 --> 01:20:03.946
SAM: Do that one that's been crazy all night.

2155
01:20:03.946 --> 01:20:06.392
LAURA: Why are you doing that?
SAM: Because it'll work.

2156
01:20:06.392 --> 01:20:07.658
MARISHA: This one?

2157
01:20:07.658 --> 01:20:09.452
This one?
LAURA: Oh, god.

2158
01:20:09.452 --> 01:20:11.743
Don't trust Sam.

2159
01:20:11.743 --> 01:20:12.576
MARISHA: 12.

2160
01:20:12.576 --> 01:20:13.741
MATT: That's a success.

2161
01:20:13.741 --> 01:20:17.020
(laughter)

2162
01:20:17.020 --> 01:20:19.684
MARISHA: Holy shit.
MATT: Okay.

2163
01:20:19.684 --> 01:20:21.843
MARISHA: Just enough.
TRAVIS: Is your hand numb?

2164
01:20:21.843 --> 01:20:24.037
MATT: So now it would be Caleb and
Caduceus's turn, so Caduceus.

2165
01:20:24.037 --> 01:20:26.002
TALIESIN: Mass Healing Word.

2166
01:20:26.002 --> 01:20:29.778
Anyone who's unconscious gains nine hit points.

2167
01:20:29.778 --> 01:20:31.068
MATT: You were holding onto that.

2168
01:20:31.068 --> 01:20:33.443
TALIESIN: Everybody else gets seven points.

2169
01:20:35.254 --> 01:20:36.319
Actually, it would be six people,

2170
01:20:36.319 --> 01:20:40.926
so one, two, three, four, five, six.

2171
01:20:40.926 --> 01:20:43.045
LIAM: Did you skip the gorilla, which is totally fine?

2172
01:20:43.045 --> 01:20:45.330
TALIESIN: Oh, I woulda skipped the gorilla, I suppose.

2173
01:20:45.330 --> 01:20:48.146
So it would've been, and I know you're fine,

2174
01:20:48.146 --> 01:20:51.204
so it woulda been one, two, three, four, five,

2175
01:20:51.204 --> 01:20:53.137
and I'll hit you, too, because I was trying to make friends.

2176
01:20:53.137 --> 01:20:54.295
MATT: Sure.

2177
01:20:54.295 --> 01:20:55.746
TALIESIN: So.
MATT: Okay.

2178
01:20:55.746 --> 01:20:57.480
TALIESIN: Nine for anybody who's unconscious,

2179
01:20:57.480 --> 01:20:59.685
six for everybody else.

2180
01:20:59.685 --> 01:21:03.535
MATT: As you all feel the surge of energy from Caduceus,

2181
01:21:03.535 --> 01:21:05.674
you shoot back to consciousness,

2182
01:21:05.674 --> 01:21:07.536
you shoot back to consciousness.
MARISHA: Ah, I hate this!

2183
01:21:07.536 --> 01:21:09.200
SAM: Ah!
LAURA: What happened?

2184
01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:12.251
TALIESIN: I'm going to look at the Caedogeist.

2185
01:21:14.117 --> 01:21:16.190
Can I get a hug?

2186
01:21:17.365 --> 01:21:18.940
MATT: You watch as she goes,

2187
01:21:20.023 --> 01:21:23.798
"Not my type of interaction."

2188
01:21:23.798 --> 01:21:26.351
TALIESIN: I got a heal for you when you're ready.

2189
01:21:26.351 --> 01:21:27.385
MATT: "I'll be fine."

2190
01:21:27.385 --> 01:21:28.420
And you watch the Caedogeist look around

2191
01:21:28.420 --> 01:21:29.640
at the rest of you.

2192
01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:30.948
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're all doing the end

2193
01:21:30.948 --> 01:21:32.363
of the musical number breathing.

2194
01:21:32.363 --> 01:21:33.196
MATT: Yeah.

2195
01:21:33.196 --> 01:21:34.813
ALL: (panting)

2196
01:21:34.813 --> 01:21:37.206
LIAM: Caedogeist just sees--
MATT: "(shushes)"

2197
01:21:37.206 --> 01:21:39.257
LAURA: What the shushing?
SAM: What is the shushing?

2198
01:21:39.257 --> 01:21:41.153
MATT: She just vanishes into the wall.

2199
01:21:41.153 --> 01:21:42.275
TALIESIN: That's okay.

2200
01:21:42.275 --> 01:21:44.483
MARISHA: She's so cool.

2201
01:21:44.483 --> 01:21:45.646
TALIESIN: I'm all right with that.

2202
01:21:45.646 --> 01:21:46.677
LAURA: Did she kill it?

2203
01:21:46.677 --> 01:21:48.652
LIAM: The giant ginger gorilla's shoving his head

2204
01:21:48.652 --> 01:21:50.437
into the hallway and looking in to see

2205
01:21:50.437 --> 01:21:53.987
Beauregard being tended to over here.

2206
01:21:53.987 --> 01:21:56.943
MATT: The remnants of Obann, you can see,

2207
01:21:56.943 --> 01:21:59.425
there is still like chunks of the body around,

2208
01:21:59.425 --> 01:22:02.614
but they're slowly just (slurping), just liquefying.

2209
01:22:02.614 --> 01:22:05.663
ASHLEY: Can I walk in and see if there's anything, heart,

2210
01:22:05.663 --> 01:22:07.368
anything that seems important?

2211
01:22:07.368 --> 01:22:08.694
SAM: I'm going to dig through the guts.

2212
01:22:08.694 --> 01:22:09.748
Caleb!

2213
01:22:09.748 --> 01:22:11.273
Caleb, are you in there?

2214
01:22:11.273 --> 01:22:13.568
MATT: (laughs)

2215
01:22:13.568 --> 01:22:17.401
TALIESIN: I'm going to sit and start a Prayer of Healing.

2216
01:22:18.532 --> 01:22:21.698
MATT: No. Pretty much-- saying for the--

2217
01:22:21.698 --> 01:22:22.943
as you guys are going through, like,

2218
01:22:22.943 --> 01:22:26.274
everything you grab and pull, it's like a jello

2219
01:22:26.274 --> 01:22:27.522
that's been in the sun for a bit.

2220
01:22:27.522 --> 01:22:29.507
Like it's turning into liquid in your fingertips.

2221
01:22:29.507 --> 01:22:31.628
And it's sticky and it's getting all over you,

2222
01:22:31.628 --> 01:22:34.701
and by the time you've sifted through it,

2223
01:22:34.701 --> 01:22:38.393
it's mostly just now a puddle of black oil

2224
01:22:38.393 --> 01:22:40.143
tar-like material.

2225
01:22:40.143 --> 01:22:41.761
LAURA: I'm just going to stay sitting on the ground

2226
01:22:41.761 --> 01:22:44.755
watching numbly at everything going on around.

2227
01:22:44.755 --> 01:22:47.461
LIAM: Gorilla lumbers over, picks up Nott by the scruff,

2228
01:22:47.461 --> 01:22:49.435
whose legs and hands are just going boop boop boop.

2229
01:22:49.435 --> 01:22:51.113
(grunts)

2230
01:22:51.113 --> 01:22:54.286
And she's sitting on his head, 28-ish feet in the air.

2231
01:22:54.286 --> 01:22:58.232
SAM: Oh. (sniffs) Smells like Caleb.

2232
01:22:58.232 --> 01:23:00.296
I think it's Caleb.

2233
01:23:00.296 --> 01:23:01.653
LIAM: (grunting)

2234
01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:04.687
TRAVIS: Everybody's up?

2235
01:23:06.267 --> 01:23:07.667
MARISHA: Yeah.

2236
01:23:07.667 --> 01:23:08.500
LIAM: (grunts)

2237
01:23:09.999 --> 01:23:11.607
TRAVIS: Oh god.

2238
01:23:11.607 --> 01:23:13.472
Do we even go out and check on Pumat?

2239
01:23:13.472 --> 01:23:16.838
I'm so fucking spent.

2240
01:23:16.838 --> 01:23:20.828
SAM: We have to, or at least let me send a message.

2241
01:23:20.828 --> 01:23:21.873
TRAVIS: Sure.

2242
01:23:21.873 --> 01:23:23.624
SAM: I'll point up in the direction of Pumat

2243
01:23:23.624 --> 01:23:26.834
and whisper into a wire, Pumat, if you're alive,

2244
01:23:26.834 --> 01:23:29.609
please, respond to this message.

2245
01:23:29.609 --> 01:23:30.672
MATT: What's the range on it?

2246
01:23:30.672 --> 01:23:32.857
SAM: I think it's 100 feet.
LAURA: 100 feet?

2247
01:23:32.857 --> 01:23:34.913
MATT: 100 feet? There's no response.

2248
01:23:34.913 --> 01:23:36.501
SAM: Oh, we're down that far?

2249
01:23:36.501 --> 01:23:38.482
MATT: You guys are a bit further than that from--

2250
01:23:38.482 --> 01:23:41.372
LAURA: Oh, I've got a third level left with my--
SAM: It's 120 feet.

2251
01:23:41.372 --> 01:23:42.499
MATT: Yeah, nothing.

2252
01:23:42.499 --> 01:23:47.120
LAURA: I've got a third level left with my Pearl of Power.

2253
01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:48.411
SAM: Guys, Pumat is dead.

2254
01:23:48.411 --> 01:23:50.960
LAURA: I'm going to cast Sending.
MATT: Okay.

2255
01:23:52.127 --> 01:23:56.277
LAURA: Pumat, are you alive?

2256
01:23:56.277 --> 01:23:58.343
Is everything okay up there?

2257
01:23:58.343 --> 01:24:02.668
Please tell me you're still alive up there?

2258
01:24:03.773 --> 01:24:04.940
SAM: You pooping?

2259
01:24:06.130 --> 01:24:08.375
LAURA: No, I'm not going to say that.

2260
01:24:08.375 --> 01:24:09.397
MATT: There's no response.

2261
01:24:09.397 --> 01:24:11.001
SAM: (gasps)

2262
01:24:11.001 --> 01:24:12.189
TALIESIN: It could be anything.

2263
01:24:12.189 --> 01:24:13.603
LAURA: He's not responding.

2264
01:24:13.603 --> 01:24:16.066
MARISHA: Maybe he's still fighting.

2265
01:24:16.066 --> 01:24:18.348
LAURA: I feel like he could respond even if he was,

2266
01:24:18.348 --> 01:24:21.709
I would hear him breathing or something.

2267
01:24:21.709 --> 01:24:23.576
TRAVIS: We should go check on him.

2268
01:24:23.576 --> 01:24:25.573
MARISHA: Oh no.

2269
01:24:25.573 --> 01:24:29.502
SAM: What if there's still all those creatures out there?

2270
01:24:29.502 --> 01:24:34.502
Maybe... I'm actually relatively okay.

2271
01:24:34.517 --> 01:24:36.616
TALIESIN: You mind checking ahead?

2272
01:24:36.616 --> 01:24:38.367
ASHLEY: I'll go with you.
SAM: Yeah.

2273
01:24:38.367 --> 01:24:40.433
ASHLEY: Because I'm relatively okay.
SAM: And the ape,

2274
01:24:41.275 --> 01:24:43.425
Capeleb, could come with us.

2275
01:24:43.425 --> 01:24:44.999
(laughter, groans)

2276
01:24:44.999 --> 01:24:47.394
TRAVIS: Can he fit through that arch?

2277
01:24:47.394 --> 01:24:48.336
MATT: Nope.

2278
01:24:48.336 --> 01:24:49.552
LIAM: Nope.

2279
01:24:49.552 --> 01:24:52.601
ASHLEY: Does anybody want to stay and heal and rest,

2280
01:24:52.601 --> 01:24:55.768
and we can just go look?

2281
01:24:55.768 --> 01:24:57.181
TALIESIN: I'd rather keep everyone up.

2282
01:24:57.181 --> 01:24:59.418
We should just go up.

2283
01:24:59.418 --> 01:25:01.242
MARISHA: Why don't we check it out first.
TALIESIN: Better have all of us together.

2284
01:25:01.242 --> 01:25:03.597
TRAVIS: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Together.

2285
01:25:03.597 --> 01:25:06.930
ASHLEY: Yeah.
SAM: Hey, Yasha's back.

2286
01:25:06.930 --> 01:25:08.298
TALIESIN: Welcome back.

2287
01:25:08.298 --> 01:25:10.547
MARISHA: Capeleb.

2288
01:25:10.547 --> 01:25:12.407
Carry me.

2289
01:25:12.407 --> 01:25:14.025
LIAM: (grunts)

2290
01:25:14.025 --> 01:25:15.491
MARISHA: Yeah.

2291
01:25:15.491 --> 01:25:16.628
MATT: (laughs)

2292
01:25:16.628 --> 01:25:20.594
LAURA: I'm going to walk up to Capeleb

2293
01:25:20.594 --> 01:25:24.277
and cast Cure Wounds on Beau,

2294
01:25:24.277 --> 01:25:26.240
being held by him.

2295
01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:27.223
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: Oh yeah,

2296
01:25:27.223 --> 01:25:28.848
that's the good stuff.

2297
01:25:28.848 --> 01:25:31.958
LIAM: He lets go of one side and holds her by an ankle.

2298
01:25:31.958 --> 01:25:33.716
MARISHA: All right, you're going to make me black out again,

2299
01:25:33.716 --> 01:25:35.116
dude.
LAURA: 15 points of healing.

2300
01:25:35.116 --> 01:25:36.749
MARISHA: What blood I have left

2301
01:25:36.749 --> 01:25:40.049
is rushing to my head, oh god.

2302
01:25:42.647 --> 01:25:44.871
MATT: Can't believe I got the fucking kill my own boss.

2303
01:25:44.871 --> 01:25:45.711
LIAM: Had to happen eventually.

2304
01:25:45.711 --> 01:25:46.869
TALIESIN: I mean, one of us, it was

2305
01:25:46.869 --> 01:25:48.486
going to happen, so.
LIAM: We've played for hundreds of hours.

2306
01:25:48.486 --> 01:25:50.073
MATT: I know.
LIAM: Aw!

2307
01:25:50.073 --> 01:25:51.456
MATT: I just don't want to rob you guys of it.

2308
01:25:51.456 --> 01:25:52.681
LAURA and TALIESIN: No!

2309
01:25:52.681 --> 01:25:54.554
LAURA: Matt, we're be so happy for you!

2310
01:25:54.554 --> 01:25:55.546
MARISHA: It was the best!

2311
01:25:55.546 --> 01:25:57.305
LAURA: It was cool.
MATT: All right.

2312
01:25:57.305 --> 01:25:59.402
TALIESIN: Everyone gets one.
LAURA: Yeah.

2313
01:25:59.402 --> 01:26:01.496
ASHLEY: How did it feel?

2314
01:26:01.496 --> 01:26:03.669
MATT: It felt all right. I just felt kind of bad. (laughs)

2315
01:26:03.669 --> 01:26:05.352
LAURA: No, it was awesome.

2316
01:26:05.352 --> 01:26:06.321
MATT: You were so close to finishing it.

2317
01:26:06.321 --> 01:26:08.252
LAURA: I Cure Wounds myself at level one

2318
01:26:08.252 --> 01:26:11.374
for 11 points of healing, P.S..

2319
01:26:12.649 --> 01:26:17.224
LIAM: Before changing back, Capeleb puts Beauregard down,

2320
01:26:17.224 --> 01:26:19.477
and a giant hand, I don't want to do it to you for real,

2321
01:26:19.477 --> 01:26:23.257
but just way too large ruffles her hair.

2322
01:26:23.257 --> 01:26:26.566
MARISHA: Oh, man, that's not, oh.

2323
01:26:28.087 --> 01:26:28.923
LIAM: (gorilla grunting)

2324
01:26:28.923 --> 01:26:30.673
MATT: Another death save.

2325
01:26:32.894 --> 01:26:36.159
MARISHA: No, I'm doing much better now, thank you.

2326
01:26:36.159 --> 01:26:37.031
I'm okay.

2327
01:26:37.031 --> 01:26:38.697
LIAM: (grunting)

2328
01:26:38.697 --> 01:26:41.239
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

2329
01:26:41.239 --> 01:26:43.446
Be aware of your surroundings.

2330
01:26:43.446 --> 01:26:45.187
MATT: The archway-- technically,

2331
01:26:45.187 --> 01:26:46.437
you could fit into the archway,

2332
01:26:46.437 --> 01:26:48.552
but the stairway would not fit you at all.

2333
01:26:48.552 --> 01:26:51.911
So you would not be able to, in your current ape form,

2334
01:26:51.911 --> 01:26:54.399
ascend.
LIAM: (grunting)

2335
01:26:54.399 --> 01:26:55.937
SAM and MARISHA: (laugh)

2336
01:26:55.937 --> 01:26:56.770
MATT: Cool.

2337
01:26:56.770 --> 01:26:59.991
TRAVIS: (laughs) Let's go. We have to check on him.

2338
01:26:59.991 --> 01:27:01.874
TALIESIN: Do you mind taking lead on this?

2339
01:27:01.874 --> 01:27:03.408
SAM: I'll go ahead.
TRAVIS: I'll join you.

2340
01:27:03.408 --> 01:27:05.680
SAM: I'll take a big swig of the booze and--
ASHLEY: We don't need to do anything else in here, do we?

2341
01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:06.763
TALIESIN: We don't know.

2342
01:27:06.763 --> 01:27:08.157
In here, I think we're good for now.

2343
01:27:08.157 --> 01:27:09.152
MATT: So what's the marching order?

2344
01:27:09.152 --> 01:27:10.792
SAM: I'm going first.

2345
01:27:10.792 --> 01:27:15.159
TRAVIS: Nott, Fjord, Caduceus.
TALIESIN: I'll go behind you.

2346
01:27:15.159 --> 01:27:17.250
TRAVIS: Nott, Fjord, Yasha, Caduceus.
LAURA: I'll go last.

2347
01:27:17.250 --> 01:27:19.883
MARISHA: I'll go in front of Jester.

2348
01:27:22.591 --> 01:27:25.365
SAM: What state could Pumat Sol be in

2349
01:27:25.365 --> 01:27:28.127
and not be able to respond?
LAURA: Dead.

2350
01:27:28.127 --> 01:27:29.716
SAM: Others, give me some others?

2351
01:27:29.716 --> 01:27:31.047
TRAVIS: He might have teleported out.

2352
01:27:31.047 --> 01:27:32.412
TALIESIN: Too-- Yeah.

2353
01:27:32.412 --> 01:27:34.072
SAM: But it would still reach him.

2354
01:27:34.072 --> 01:27:35.285
LAURA: Sending doesn't work--

2355
01:27:35.285 --> 01:27:37.500
TRAVIS: He might've blinked into another dimension.
MATT: Caleb, you're in the back?

2356
01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:38.775
LIAM: I said second to last.

2357
01:27:38.775 --> 01:27:40.366
MATT: Okay, so Jester's in the back.

2358
01:27:40.366 --> 01:27:42.577
LAURA: In another dimension, I think it still works,

2359
01:27:42.577 --> 01:27:44.260
as long as I know where they are.

2360
01:27:44.260 --> 01:27:46.283
MATT: So.

2361
01:27:46.283 --> 01:27:49.438
You guys ascend the steps from deep within

2362
01:27:49.438 --> 01:27:53.859
the hidden chamber of the Chantry shackle.

2363
01:27:53.859 --> 01:27:56.844
Finding your way up towards the familiar sight

2364
01:27:56.844 --> 01:28:00.924
of the open crypt passageway.

2365
01:28:00.924 --> 01:28:04.168
Stepping into the crypt chamber, the familiar old stale air

2366
01:28:04.168 --> 01:28:08.853
of this ancient, ancient crypt basement finds you.

2367
01:28:08.853 --> 01:28:10.741
You step out and there's the familiar

2368
01:28:10.741 --> 01:28:15.284
statue of the Dawnfather, atop the central platform.

2369
01:28:15.284 --> 01:28:17.011
You can see the same brazier that you once burned

2370
01:28:17.011 --> 01:28:20.859
to find the switch still burning low.

2371
01:28:20.859 --> 01:28:22.530
You continue onward?
TRAVIS: Yes.

2372
01:28:22.530 --> 01:28:23.554
MATT: Okay.

2373
01:28:23.554 --> 01:28:26.920
You come back up a few stairs into the area

2374
01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:29.692
where there was the four chambers

2375
01:28:29.692 --> 01:28:32.435
for the people that keep the Chantry,

2376
01:28:32.435 --> 01:28:36.293
the long-poisoned bodies still left in their beds.

2377
01:28:36.293 --> 01:28:38.040
You ascend the staircase that leads

2378
01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:42.792
into the cathedral, and say--

2379
01:28:42.792 --> 01:28:45.940
LAURA: Do we hear anything on the other side of the doors?

2380
01:28:45.940 --> 01:28:47.194
MATT: Before you can even to the doors,

2381
01:28:47.194 --> 01:28:48.853
you hear footsteps approaching louder.

2382
01:28:48.853 --> 01:28:51.104
(footsteps thudding)

2383
01:28:52.213 --> 01:28:55.922
You guys are in front, Nott and Fjord.
SAM: Someone's coming.

2384
01:28:55.922 --> 01:28:58.188
Everybody hide, or ready your weapons.

2385
01:28:58.188 --> 01:29:00.943
MATT: You're like 30 feet up in the staircase, so.

2386
01:29:00.943 --> 01:29:03.692
SAM: And these footsteps are coming down the staircase?

2387
01:29:03.692 --> 01:29:04.732
MATT: Yeah, in your direction.

2388
01:29:04.732 --> 01:29:07.058
You can see a bit of torchlight coming in your direction.

2389
01:29:07.058 --> 01:29:10.260
SAM: I will ready my crossbow, press myself to the wall.

2390
01:29:10.260 --> 01:29:11.893
MATT: Okay.
SAM: Go down on one knee.

2391
01:29:11.893 --> 01:29:12.996
MATT: All right.

2392
01:29:12.996 --> 01:29:15.733
As the torchlight comes, the footsteps suddenly

2393
01:29:15.733 --> 01:29:19.279
come to a stop, and you hear a voice go, "Halt!

2394
01:29:19.279 --> 01:29:23.553
"State your name and purpose or we will attack!"

2395
01:29:23.553 --> 01:29:25.513
TRAVIS: Sounds like guards.

2396
01:29:25.513 --> 01:29:27.022
MATT: You can look up in the scene in the torchlight

2397
01:29:27.022 --> 01:29:28.566
that's gathering and the person holding it,

2398
01:29:28.566 --> 01:29:30.529
there is a Righteous Brand soldier

2399
01:29:30.529 --> 01:29:33.194
and more soldiers behind them, shoulder to shoulder

2400
01:29:33.194 --> 01:29:36.065
and, you know, pushing down the space.

2401
01:29:36.065 --> 01:29:38.083
SAM: Friends of the Empire here.

2402
01:29:38.083 --> 01:29:41.782
TRAVIS: Please, we're survivors, we took refuge down here.

2403
01:29:41.782 --> 01:29:43.615
Has the danger passed?

2404
01:29:44.764 --> 01:29:47.543
MATT: Just make general persuasion check.

2405
01:29:47.543 --> 01:29:51.350
The voice seemed pretty amped.

2406
01:29:51.350 --> 01:29:53.208
TRAVIS: 18.
MATT: 18?

2407
01:29:53.208 --> 01:29:54.892
You watch the one that's holding the torch,

2408
01:29:54.892 --> 01:29:58.559
who has his hand on a blade, looks and goes,

2409
01:30:00.746 --> 01:30:03.546
"Are you The Mighty Nein?"

2410
01:30:03.546 --> 01:30:05.461
TALIESIN: Yes, we're The Mighty Nein.

2411
01:30:05.461 --> 01:30:06.796
MATT: "They're here, we found them!"

2412
01:30:06.796 --> 01:30:08.623
SAM and TALIESIN: Oh.
LAURA: Who's wondering?

2413
01:30:08.623 --> 01:30:10.018
MATT: And the soldiers start backing up

2414
01:30:10.018 --> 01:30:12.087
and heading back into the cathedral space.

2415
01:30:12.087 --> 01:30:12.928
TALIESIN: Okay.

2416
01:30:12.928 --> 01:30:15.520
SAM: Who's looking for us?
MARISHA: Yeah, who's looking for us?

2417
01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:17.528
LAURA: How do you know our name?
SAM: We'll follow.

2418
01:30:17.528 --> 01:30:18.361
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2419
01:30:18.361 --> 01:30:19.757
MATT: You guys continue up the staircase,

2420
01:30:19.757 --> 01:30:22.833
and it's a lengthy staircase, until eventually you can see

2421
01:30:22.833 --> 01:30:24.377
the faint look of interior daylight,

2422
01:30:24.377 --> 01:30:26.214
though still storming and cloudy from outside,

2423
01:30:26.214 --> 01:30:27.742
it's much brighter than the interior

2424
01:30:27.742 --> 01:30:30.174
of the lightless staircase you've been ascending.

2425
01:30:30.174 --> 01:30:32.663
Stepping back into the cathedral hall,

2426
01:30:32.663 --> 01:30:35.819
you can see around you, the marble floors are littered

2427
01:30:35.819 --> 01:30:37.893
with mushy corpses of destroyed demons

2428
01:30:37.893 --> 01:30:39.824
of various shapes and sizes.

2429
01:30:39.824 --> 01:30:42.021
The dark ichor smeared in dynamic sprays

2430
01:30:42.021 --> 01:30:44.951
against the floors around you with glittering broken shards

2431
01:30:44.951 --> 01:30:49.951
of multicolored glass window, just all over the ground.

2432
01:30:50.173 --> 01:30:52.381
The looming, charred body of the Laughing Hand

2433
01:30:52.381 --> 01:30:56.126
still stands atop the central dais, unmoving,

2434
01:30:56.126 --> 01:30:59.726
like a nightmarish statue of ash, just still

2435
01:30:59.726 --> 01:31:02.968
there in place.
LAURA: Immediately searching around for Pumat.

2436
01:31:02.968 --> 01:31:05.998
MATT: Over a dozen or so figures fill the space around you,

2437
01:31:05.998 --> 01:31:08.011
some standing at the ready, while others

2438
01:31:08.011 --> 01:31:08.998
are wounded and resting.

2439
01:31:08.998 --> 01:31:12.129
You can see numerous crownsguard in here looking haggard,

2440
01:31:12.129 --> 01:31:15.234
holding their weapons ready, and as you approach

2441
01:31:15.234 --> 01:31:17.190
and arrive out, they hold their weapons

2442
01:31:17.190 --> 01:31:19.449
up for a second, but then notice the relaxed state

2443
01:31:19.449 --> 01:31:22.584
of the Righteous Brand that first met with you,

2444
01:31:22.584 --> 01:31:24.417
and go to relax.

2445
01:31:25.850 --> 01:31:30.074
You can see there are some slain soldiers.

2446
01:31:30.074 --> 01:31:33.202
A handful of Cobalt Soul are present,

2447
01:31:33.202 --> 01:31:37.134
as well as Archivist Kathedoc,

2448
01:31:37.134 --> 01:31:39.389
the half-orc who you had met when you first arrived here.

2449
01:31:39.389 --> 01:31:40.777
SAM: Dead?
MATT: No, alive.

2450
01:31:40.777 --> 01:31:41.610
SAM: Oh.

2451
01:31:42.505 --> 01:31:46.338
MATT: Approaches as you begin to walk out.

2452
01:31:47.958 --> 01:31:52.007
"It's good to see that you have all made it here alive.

2453
01:31:52.007 --> 01:31:53.151
"We were worried."

2454
01:31:53.151 --> 01:31:56.012
TALIESIN: Where's Pumat?

2455
01:31:56.012 --> 01:31:58.659
MATT: "Over that way," and he points towards the antechamber

2456
01:31:58.659 --> 01:32:01.558
of the cathedral, where you had moved away form.

2457
01:32:01.558 --> 01:32:03.039
LAURA and MARISHA: Is he alive?

2458
01:32:03.039 --> 01:32:06.455
MATT: "He's barely, but alive."

2459
01:32:07.525 --> 01:32:10.949
SAM: Are you taking care of him? Should we go--

2460
01:32:10.949 --> 01:32:13.515
Is he in need of magical healing?

2461
01:32:13.515 --> 01:32:15.213
MATT: "Come,"

2462
01:32:15.213 --> 01:32:17.791
and leads you guys back through the open doors,

2463
01:32:17.791 --> 01:32:20.069
the two doors that lead into the front portion

2464
01:32:20.069 --> 01:32:21.037
of the cathedral.

2465
01:32:21.037 --> 01:32:24.653
Walking by, Caduceus, you notice, as does, actually,

2466
01:32:24.653 --> 01:32:29.611
Beauregard and Caleb.

2467
01:32:30.564 --> 01:32:31.718
Well no, this would be perception, actually,

2468
01:32:31.718 --> 01:32:36.718
so it would be Caduceus and Jester, and Beauregard.

2469
01:32:37.054 --> 01:32:40.549
You guys notice that underneath one of the central towers,

2470
01:32:40.549 --> 01:32:41.716
the two towers that were in the center there

2471
01:32:41.716 --> 01:32:45.555
where the balcony is, you see a shattered metallic device,

2472
01:32:45.555 --> 01:32:47.604
about two feet or so in width.

2473
01:32:47.604 --> 01:32:50.315
A central glass orb has been broken

2474
01:32:50.315 --> 01:32:52.498
and the pinkish crystals that were embedded in it

2475
01:32:52.498 --> 01:32:54.452
in four different places have been crushed.

2476
01:32:54.452 --> 01:32:59.399
It is just, the device has been completely destroyed.

2477
01:32:59.399 --> 01:33:02.412
You walk into the antechamber, and there off to the side,

2478
01:33:02.412 --> 01:33:06.036
you can see there's a few other crownsguard

2479
01:33:06.036 --> 01:33:09.206
that are in the process of tending to their own wounds,

2480
01:33:09.206 --> 01:33:10.714
and on the ground you can see there's one person

2481
01:33:10.714 --> 01:33:15.363
who has finished bandaging a very, very hurt Pumat Sol.

2482
01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:20.206
As you approach, you see him lying on the ground,

2483
01:33:20.206 --> 01:33:22.824
bandages all over, one eye is covered with a bandage.

2484
01:33:22.824 --> 01:33:25.324
You can see there's blood spray on him.

2485
01:33:25.324 --> 01:33:28.357
The eye flickers open a bit and turns in your direction.

2486
01:33:31.044 --> 01:33:34.602
"Oh, hey there."
(laughter)

2487
01:33:34.602 --> 01:33:37.523
LAURA: I rush over and take his hand.
MATT: "Oh, ow, ow."

2488
01:33:37.523 --> 01:33:39.270
LAURA: I'm sorry.

2489
01:33:39.270 --> 01:33:42.455
MATT: "Oh, I was worried about you folks."

2490
01:33:42.455 --> 01:33:43.636
SAM: Worried about us?

2491
01:33:43.636 --> 01:33:46.303
MATT: "Happy to see your faces."
LAURA: We were so worried about you.

2492
01:33:47.223 --> 01:33:48.140
MATT: "I'm okay.

2493
01:33:49.341 --> 01:33:52.256
"Figured those buggers were coming from somewhere,

2494
01:33:52.256 --> 01:33:56.557
"so seeing them portals in the towers, I just,

2495
01:33:56.557 --> 01:34:01.341
"I managed to find that metal thingy and smash it.

2496
01:34:02.366 --> 01:34:05.450
"Worked good, too. They stopped coming through. (coughing)"

2497
01:34:05.450 --> 01:34:07.717
LAURA: You were really, really big.

2498
01:34:07.717 --> 01:34:08.550
TALIESIN: That was real cool.

2499
01:34:08.550 --> 01:34:10.904
SAM: Would you like a healing potion?

2500
01:34:10.904 --> 01:34:15.004
MATT: "Oh yeah, I would not, you know,

2501
01:34:15.004 --> 01:34:16.132
"be against it."

2502
01:34:16.132 --> 01:34:18.972
(bottle rattling)

2503
01:34:18.972 --> 01:34:21.494
SAM: I will heal Pumat for--

2504
01:34:21.494 --> 01:34:23.845
LIAM: Ooh.
SAM: Ew.

2505
01:34:23.845 --> 01:34:25.367
Six plus four, I think, right?

2506
01:34:25.367 --> 01:34:27.197
MATT: All right, so 10.

2507
01:34:27.197 --> 01:34:28.921
Heals 10.
LAURA: That's a lot of money.

2508
01:34:28.921 --> 01:34:31.135
SAM: He probably made this one.

2509
01:34:31.135 --> 01:34:32.309
MARISHA: Yeah.

2510
01:34:32.309 --> 01:34:34.600
MATT: Yeah, well you brought him from stabilized

2511
01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:38.198
and barely conscious to at least somewhat more like, lucid.

2512
01:34:38.198 --> 01:34:41.995
Leans in a bit. (groans)

2513
01:34:41.995 --> 01:34:45.903
"Oh, thank you very much there, little

2514
01:34:45.903 --> 01:34:47.473
"Nott lady, right?"

2515
01:34:47.473 --> 01:34:49.444
SAM: Yeah, it's Nott, yeah.
MATT: "All right.

2516
01:34:49.444 --> 01:34:51.777
"Sorry, I get overwhelmed a little bit.

2517
01:34:51.777 --> 01:34:54.163
"Thankfully, these Cobalt Soul folks arrived

2518
01:34:54.163 --> 01:34:57.337
"and helped me out of a real jam.

2519
01:34:57.337 --> 01:35:00.048
"That was all kindsa close."

2520
01:35:00.048 --> 01:35:05.048
SAM: Did you-- You must've killed a dozen or so.

2521
01:35:05.154 --> 01:35:08.121
MATT: "I lost count after, like, the first 20."

2522
01:35:08.121 --> 01:35:09.379
SAM: Whoa!
TRAVIS: That sounds about right.

2523
01:35:09.379 --> 01:35:11.503
SAM: You're a maniac.
TALIESIN: That's pretty amazing.

2524
01:35:11.503 --> 01:35:13.425
MARISHA: You're a hero, Pumat.

2525
01:35:13.425 --> 01:35:17.474
MATT: "Eh, just helping out.

2526
01:35:17.474 --> 01:35:20.708
"It's been a while since I've got to flex

2527
01:35:20.708 --> 01:35:22.973
"the old Pu-muscles, you know?"

2528
01:35:22.973 --> 01:35:25.739
(laughter)

2529
01:35:25.739 --> 01:35:27.229
LAURA: The poo muscles?

2530
01:35:27.229 --> 01:35:30.292
MATT: "Pumat muscles.

2531
01:35:30.292 --> 01:35:32.601
"Just combining the two words, you know."

2532
01:35:32.601 --> 01:35:34.503
LAURA: Yeah, no, don't ever say that again.

2533
01:35:34.503 --> 01:35:36.952
I mean, I like it, but I don't think...

2534
01:35:36.952 --> 01:35:38.310
ASHLEY: I think that means something else.

2535
01:35:38.310 --> 01:35:40.605
TRAVIS: You liked poo muscle?

2536
01:35:40.605 --> 01:35:42.282
LAURA: I think it's a good word.

2537
01:35:42.282 --> 01:35:46.576
TALIESIN: Return to the field,
you got a taste for adventure again?

2538
01:35:46.576 --> 01:35:47.667
MATT: "Nah."
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah.

2539
01:35:47.667 --> 01:35:50.758
MATT: "Nah, I think I'm pretty happy
staying where I've been.

2540
01:35:50.758 --> 01:35:53.343
"I'm going to just rest now, I'm just going to--"

2541
01:35:53.343 --> 01:35:54.512
TALIESIN: Yeah, you go.

2542
01:35:54.512 --> 01:35:57.009
TRAVIS: Pumat, it's been crazy below.

2543
01:35:57.009 --> 01:36:00.489
Did you see anyone in charge since you've been up here?

2544
01:36:00.489 --> 01:36:03.809
MATT: "Charge of-- you mean that one?"

2545
01:36:03.809 --> 01:36:06.235
Points over and you can see standing at the doors

2546
01:36:06.235 --> 01:36:08.851
where you would exit,

2547
01:36:08.851 --> 01:36:13.234
you see a half-elf woman,

2548
01:36:14.409 --> 01:36:18.284
olive skin, dark brown eyes, and short, jet-black hair,

2549
01:36:18.284 --> 01:36:20.460
her helmet off to the side, and you see is wearing

2550
01:36:20.460 --> 01:36:23.439
Righteous Brand armor, but the insignia on it,

2551
01:36:23.439 --> 01:36:27.418
the trim and the design of the red cape

2552
01:36:27.418 --> 01:36:28.964
that's thrown over one shoulder signifies

2553
01:36:28.964 --> 01:36:31.880
a higher rank than a standard soldier.

2554
01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:34.810
And as Pumat points, she is in the process

2555
01:36:34.810 --> 01:36:38.065
of talking to two folks and looks over in your direction,

2556
01:36:38.065 --> 01:36:39.335
and starts making the walk towards you.

2557
01:36:39.335 --> 01:36:41.359
As that happens, Pumat's hand goes down, he's like,

2558
01:36:41.359 --> 01:36:43.405
"Okay, sleepy time."

2559
01:36:43.405 --> 01:36:45.268
TRAVIS: Rest well, friend.

2560
01:36:45.268 --> 01:36:46.481
MATT: He just goes right to sleep.
TALIESIN: We need to put

2561
01:36:46.481 --> 01:36:48.110
guards in that door, we haven't

2562
01:36:48.110 --> 01:36:52.158
deactivated the mess down there, it's still dangerous.

2563
01:36:52.158 --> 01:36:54.199
LIAM: Find out what is going on outside.

2564
01:36:54.199 --> 01:36:55.032
MARISHA: Yeah.

2565
01:36:55.994 --> 01:36:58.895
MATT: The figure approaches at this point.

2566
01:36:58.895 --> 01:37:02.395
MARISHA: Talk to-- hi, hi.

2567
01:37:02.395 --> 01:37:03.717
MATT: "Hello.

2568
01:37:03.717 --> 01:37:08.458
"I am Marshal Ishmara, and you are under my watch.

2569
01:37:10.055 --> 01:37:12.658
"Kathedoc spoke of your arrival,

2570
01:37:12.658 --> 01:37:16.408
"and the plight that was spoken when you came.

2571
01:37:17.271 --> 01:37:19.456
"It seems there is some truth to this,

2572
01:37:19.456 --> 01:37:23.089
"but all matters, until they have been sussed out,

2573
01:37:23.089 --> 01:37:26.488
"are in my watch, and you are not to leave my sight.

2574
01:37:26.488 --> 01:37:28.151
"Do you understand?"

2575
01:37:28.151 --> 01:37:30.322
TRAVIS: Yes, I don't think there's any
problem with that at all.

2576
01:37:30.322 --> 01:37:33.656
LAURA: Quick, what god do you worship?

2577
01:37:33.656 --> 01:37:34.974
MATT: "I'm not one of worship.

2578
01:37:34.974 --> 01:37:37.860
"I'm one who works for the Empire.

2579
01:37:37.860 --> 01:37:40.311
"The people are who I protect."

2580
01:37:40.311 --> 01:37:41.144
TALIESIN: Insight check.
LAURA: Quick, what do you think

2581
01:37:41.144 --> 01:37:43.650
about the Chained Oblivion?

2582
01:37:45.208 --> 01:37:47.848
MATT: Looks past the mess behind you.

2583
01:37:47.848 --> 01:37:49.911
"Seemingly quite messy."

2584
01:37:49.911 --> 01:37:51.936
TALIESIN: 25.
LARUA: Insight check as well.

2585
01:37:51.936 --> 01:37:53.391
MATT: Make an insight check.
TALIESIN: 25.

2586
01:37:53.391 --> 01:37:55.131
MATT: 25 insight check? (chuckles)

2587
01:37:55.131 --> 01:37:56.386
All right.

2588
01:37:56.386 --> 01:37:57.396
SAM: Oh, whispers.

2589
01:37:57.396 --> 01:37:58.858
TRAVIS: You're just doing it for the whispers.

2590
01:37:58.858 --> 01:38:00.872
You're just doing it for those sweet dulcet tones, man.

2591
01:38:00.872 --> 01:38:03.293
TALIESIN: ♪ Mysterious whisper ♪

2592
01:38:03.293 --> 01:38:05.802
SAM: This whisper is brought to you by Dwarven Forge,

2593
01:38:05.802 --> 01:38:09.019
because I forgot to say it when we were in combat.

2594
01:38:09.019 --> 01:38:12.003
They'll be at PAX Unplugged over this weekend.

2595
01:38:12.003 --> 01:38:14.827

MATT: Critical Bard.

2600
01:38:26.141 --> 01:38:27.414
All right.

2601
01:38:27.414 --> 01:38:32.414
TALIESIN: Sorry, what was, sorry, you seem all right.

2602
01:38:33.415 --> 01:38:35.271
We still have a problem downstairs,

2603
01:38:35.271 --> 01:38:37.311
we got to make sure no one goes down there right now,

2604
01:38:37.311 --> 01:38:39.664
there's still some bad things down there that--

2605
01:38:39.664 --> 01:38:42.846
LAURA: Chained Oblivion, and some sludge.

2606
01:38:42.846 --> 01:38:44.387
TALIESIN: There's still an active

2607
01:38:44.387 --> 01:38:46.377
ritual and we can't have anyone--
ASHLEY: The Angel of Irons.

2608
01:38:46.377 --> 01:38:47.210
TALIESIN: -- go down.

2609
01:38:47.210 --> 01:38:49.398
LAURA: There were glyphs.
SAM: But in addition to that,

2610
01:38:49.398 --> 01:38:52.129
what of the crick attack?

2611
01:38:52.129 --> 01:38:54.920
LAURA: Don't--! Oh, right.

2612
01:38:54.920 --> 01:38:58.656
MATT: "Well, the attacks were sudden on the city,

2613
01:38:58.656 --> 01:39:01.739
"but equally sudden was their retreat.

2614
01:39:02.718 --> 01:39:06.810
"They seem to have pulled back within the last

2615
01:39:06.810 --> 01:39:10.643
"half an hour or so, without particular reason."

2616
01:39:11.824 --> 01:39:12.819
TALIESIN: Interesting.

2617
01:39:12.819 --> 01:39:16.590
MATT: "Concerning the events that
you appear to be tied to, perhaps,

2618
01:39:16.590 --> 01:39:20.012
"and as such, you are to be brought before the Prime Arbiter

2619
01:39:20.012 --> 01:39:22.860
"to speak your case of what you've experienced here."

2620
01:39:22.860 --> 01:39:25.024
MARISHA: Are we under arrest, Marshal?

2621
01:39:25.024 --> 01:39:29.708
MATT: "No, you are individuals of interest.

2622
01:39:29.708 --> 01:39:34.059
"It is highly recommended that you come with me

2623
01:39:34.059 --> 01:39:37.216
"to ensure that we do not have a reason to arrest you."

2624
01:39:37.216 --> 01:39:40.519
MARISHA: Is she trying to speak to me in code?

2625
01:39:40.519 --> 01:39:42.877
Insight check?
MATT: Make an insight check.

2626
01:39:42.877 --> 01:39:44.101
MARISHA: Why's she looking at me like that?

2627
01:39:44.101 --> 01:39:46.703
TRAVIS: That's the fucking-do-what-I-say voice.

2628
01:39:46.703 --> 01:39:47.536
MARISHA: Natural 20.

2629
01:39:47.536 --> 01:39:50.720
MATT: Natural 20. I won't even
whisper it, I'll just tell you,

2630
01:39:50.720 --> 01:39:54.507
she doesn't like you challenging her authority.

2631
01:39:54.507 --> 01:39:56.124
It's a tone you're very familiar with.

2632
01:39:56.124 --> 01:39:59.792
MARISHA: Yeah, it's a tone that I tend to challenge.

2633
01:39:59.792 --> 01:40:03.552
TALIESIN: Before we go anywhere, can we get somebody to--

2634
01:40:03.552 --> 01:40:05.524
can we maybe dispel that thing downstairs

2635
01:40:05.524 --> 01:40:07.419
or do something to make sure that it's--

2636
01:40:07.419 --> 01:40:09.768
MATT: Kathedoc approaches at this point and goes,

2637
01:40:09.768 --> 01:40:11.500
"We have more coming.

2638
01:40:11.500 --> 01:40:13.731
"We can take care of the rest, unless you know

2639
01:40:13.731 --> 01:40:16.024
"there is an immediate threat of anything else down there

2640
01:40:16.024 --> 01:40:17.402
"that we're worried would--"

2641
01:40:17.402 --> 01:40:19.928
LAURA: Unless the sludgy guy comes back.

2642
01:40:19.928 --> 01:40:22.447
TRAVIS: It is a mess, I would put
someone down there immediately

2643
01:40:22.447 --> 01:40:24.904
to keep an eye out.
MATT: "Understood."

2644
01:40:24.904 --> 01:40:26.927
TRAVIS: Avoid the circles on the floor.

2645
01:40:26.927 --> 01:40:28.822
They seem to be active still.

2646
01:40:28.822 --> 01:40:30.204
MATT: "All right."

2647
01:40:30.204 --> 01:40:31.428
LAURA: Don't stand on it.

2648
01:40:31.428 --> 01:40:33.225
ASHLEY: Yeah, don't let anybody stand on the circles.

2649
01:40:33.225 --> 01:40:34.369
LAURA: ♪ Don't stand ♪

2650

2651
01:40:40.314 --> 01:40:42.410
MATT: "Curious warning, but taken."

2652
01:40:42.410 --> 01:40:45.613
At this point, you can see now, about 20 more townsguard

2653
01:40:45.613 --> 01:40:48.287
are approaching, and it seems like,

2654
01:40:48.287 --> 01:40:51.525
in the time since you put out your calls for aid

2655
01:40:51.525 --> 01:40:54.464
when you arrived, now the cavalry's showing up.

2656
01:40:54.464 --> 01:40:57.730
MARISHA: Is Ishmara still watching us?
MATT: Yeah.

2657
01:40:57.730 --> 01:40:58.663
MARISHA: Okay.
TALIESIN: Going to do a little

2658
01:40:58.663 --> 01:41:02.704
walk around and just start a Decompose spell

2659
01:41:02.704 --> 01:41:07.421
on as many bodies, and just waft through the church and just

2660
01:41:07.421 --> 01:41:08.898
tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.

2661
01:41:08.898 --> 01:41:11.305
MATT: The demonic sludge that's left behind

2662
01:41:11.305 --> 01:41:12.782
doesn't take to any sort of fungus,

2663
01:41:12.782 --> 01:41:14.125
but there are a number of bodies

2664
01:41:14.125 --> 01:41:15.598
that are currently being pulled aside

2665
01:41:15.598 --> 01:41:20.219
and put in a line of the various cultists,

2666
01:41:20.219 --> 01:41:22.011
just to identify who they were

2667
01:41:22.011 --> 01:41:23.501
and to begin the investigation.
LAURA: Will they still be able to tell who they

2668
01:41:23.501 --> 01:41:24.959
were if you--

2669
01:41:24.959 --> 01:41:27.332
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.
LAURA: Okay.

2670
01:41:27.332 --> 01:41:28.596
TALIESIN: They'll smell better.

2671
01:41:28.596 --> 01:41:31.590
MATT: A handful of looks like crownsguard

2672
01:41:31.590 --> 01:41:33.163
and maybe two Righteous Brand soldiers

2673
01:41:33.163 --> 01:41:35.967
that were also lost in the battle

2674
01:41:35.967 --> 01:41:39.446
of whatever demons that Pumat was overwhelmed by.

2675
01:41:40.355 --> 01:41:41.888
So.

2676
01:41:41.888 --> 01:41:43.671
MARISHA: Do I see...

2677
01:41:43.671 --> 01:41:46.301
any other cardinals

2678
01:41:46.301 --> 01:41:49.836
or any other people from the church?

2679
01:41:49.836 --> 01:41:50.771
MATT: Make a perception check.

2680
01:41:50.771 --> 01:41:53.398
MARISHA: That are still like lingering about?

2681
01:41:53.398 --> 01:41:54.807
Perception check?

2682
01:41:55.833 --> 01:41:57.748
Okay, 15?

2683
01:41:57.748 --> 01:41:58.600
MATT: 15?

2684
01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:00.574
At the moment, you do not see anybody who's wearing

2685
01:42:00.574 --> 01:42:03.527
the signifying robes of the Chantry.

2686
01:42:03.527 --> 01:42:05.670
You've only been here for maybe

2687
01:42:05.670 --> 01:42:08.779
an hour and a half tops total,

2688
01:42:08.779 --> 01:42:10.706
and most of the people that were probably

2689
01:42:10.706 --> 01:42:13.465
present in the Chantry were poisoned below.

2690
01:42:13.465 --> 01:42:15.474
You gather there's probably more members to the Chantry,

2691
01:42:15.474 --> 01:42:18.007
or if they are, they're just not present at the moment.

2692
01:42:18.007 --> 01:42:21.433
LAURA: We should tell the marshal
about the bodies downstairs.

2693
01:42:22.625 --> 01:42:24.518
MATT: So do you inform--
LAURA: There's bodies downstairs.

2694
01:42:24.518 --> 01:42:25.895
(laughter)

2695
01:42:25.895 --> 01:42:26.916
TALIESIN: Well done.

2696
01:42:26.916 --> 01:42:28.002
MATT: "What kind of bodies?"

2697
01:42:28.002 --> 01:42:31.547
LAURA: They were members of the church here, of the Chantry.

2698
01:42:31.547 --> 01:42:34.898
They were, I don't know, they were killed.

2699
01:42:34.898 --> 01:42:36.978
TALIESIN: In their sleep.

2700
01:42:36.978 --> 01:42:38.928
SAM: Not by us.

2701
01:42:38.928 --> 01:42:41.869
By these folks up here, the demons.

2702
01:42:41.869 --> 01:42:43.562
MATT: Looks over at Kathedoc.

2703
01:42:43.562 --> 01:42:44.615
"Are you getting this?"

2704
01:42:44.615 --> 01:42:49.275
He goes, "Yes, yes, we're looking into this investigation.

2705
01:42:49.275 --> 01:42:51.024
"It will be thorough. Thank you."

2706
01:42:51.024 --> 01:42:54.279
LAURA: It looks like the cultists did some serious defacing

2707
01:42:54.279 --> 01:42:57.804
on some of the, um, stuff,

2708
01:42:57.804 --> 01:42:58.895
too.

2709
01:42:59.934 --> 01:43:00.934
MATT: "I can imagine.

2710
01:43:00.934 --> 01:43:05.290
"Such terrible figures would do such a thing.

2711
01:43:06.615 --> 01:43:09.671
"Well. Marshal."

2712
01:43:09.671 --> 01:43:11.901
And Kathedoc walks back into the cathedral.

2713
01:43:11.901 --> 01:43:13.733
TRAVIS: Could I make my way over to the corpse

2714
01:43:13.733 --> 01:43:14.924
of the Laughing Hand?

2715
01:43:14.924 --> 01:43:17.165
I'm sure it's already been looked, but since it's--

2716
01:43:17.165 --> 01:43:18.393
MATT: No one's gotten near it.

2717
01:43:18.393 --> 01:43:20.246
There's like a wide berth around, everyone just like--

2718
01:43:20.246 --> 01:43:22.010
ASHLEY: I wanted to look.
TALIESIN and TRAVIS: Yeah.

2719
01:43:22.010 --> 01:43:25.033
TRAVIS: We walk over and do a search just on its body,

2720
01:43:25.033 --> 01:43:28.113
I know it's charred black, but anything that sticks out

2721
01:43:28.113 --> 01:43:29.412
that might've been on it?

2722
01:43:29.412 --> 01:43:31.912
MATT: Make an investigation check.

2723
01:43:33.705 --> 01:43:35.551
LAURA: Guidance!

2724
01:43:35.551 --> 01:43:37.341
TRAVIS: I don't think it works like that,

2725
01:43:37.341 --> 01:43:39.944
but that's okay, because it's 22.

2726
01:43:39.944 --> 01:43:41.527
MATT: 22? Okay.

2727
01:43:41.527 --> 01:43:43.464
You step forward, and everyone around stops

2728
01:43:43.464 --> 01:43:44.495
and watches you as you do it.

2729
01:43:44.495 --> 01:43:47.689
They're just like, "Oh shit, he's approaching this thing."

2730
01:43:47.689 --> 01:43:49.477
And it's-- stepping up to it again,

2731
01:43:49.477 --> 01:43:51.792
the face is like this much higher than you,

2732
01:43:51.792 --> 01:43:53.407
and it still has strong definition,

2733
01:43:53.407 --> 01:43:56.492
though it is just black, and it's all gray,

2734
01:43:56.492 --> 01:43:58.209
and it looks cracked and textured,

2735
01:43:58.209 --> 01:44:00.700
and as you like, reach up and grab

2736
01:44:00.700 --> 01:44:02.733
at the cloak to try and, the edges of the cloak

2737
01:44:02.733 --> 01:44:04.663
or the body you pull, as soon as you touch it,

2738
01:44:04.663 --> 01:44:09.155
the body (whooshing), scatters into ash.

2739
01:44:10.506 --> 01:44:14.595
Leaving this pile and trail.

2740
01:44:14.595 --> 01:44:17.769
TRAVIS: Let the winds take you to your place of rest.

2741
01:44:17.769 --> 01:44:20.422
(Sam and Marisha laughing)

2742
01:44:20.422 --> 01:44:21.392
TALIESIN: That's real deep.

2743
01:44:21.392 --> 01:44:23.514
LAURA: I hope somebody got a picture.
Somebody took a picture, right?

2744
01:44:23.514 --> 01:44:24.954
TALIESIN: Did you just think of that?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

2745
01:44:24.954 --> 01:44:27.344
I mean, it just came to me on the winds.

2746
01:44:27.344 --> 01:44:30.041
Wildmother be up in here.

2747
01:44:30.041 --> 01:44:31.358
MARISHA: (laughs)

2748
01:44:31.358 --> 01:44:32.691
TALIESIN: Up in here.
TRAVIS: (whistles)

2749
01:44:32.691 --> 01:44:34.699
TALIESIN: So true.
ASHLEY: He was probably stuck in there.

2750
01:44:34.699 --> 01:44:37.518
MARISHA: Did Kathedoc head downstairs?

2751
01:44:37.518 --> 01:44:39.471
MATT: He's gathering the rest of the Cobalt Soul,

2752
01:44:39.471 --> 01:44:41.807
as well as the Righteous Brand soldiers

2753
01:44:41.807 --> 01:44:44.358
that went ahead of them, that met with you guys,

2754
01:44:44.358 --> 01:44:46.266
are beginning to head down ahead of the Cobalt Soul.

2755
01:44:46.266 --> 01:44:48.001
Looks like they're building like a small regiment

2756
01:44:48.001 --> 01:44:49.636
to now go down and investigate.

2757
01:44:49.636 --> 01:44:53.535
MARISHA: Does it look at any case,

2758
01:44:53.535 --> 01:44:56.293
like by my assessment,

2759
01:44:56.293 --> 01:45:00.582
that I can like, say something to him on the side

2760
01:45:00.582 --> 01:45:02.899
without Marshal seeing?

2761
01:45:03.805 --> 01:45:05.028
MATT: Possibly.

2762
01:45:05.028 --> 01:45:07.643
I mean, the marshal's not like right there at all times,

2763
01:45:07.643 --> 01:45:08.758
is just keeping an eye on all of you

2764
01:45:08.758 --> 01:45:11.141
and making sure you aren't going to just run off somewhere.

2765
01:45:11.141 --> 01:45:12.020
MARISHA: Okay.

2766
01:45:12.020 --> 01:45:15.325
I will then saunter over to Kathedoc.

2767
01:45:15.325 --> 01:45:16.850
MATT: Okay.

2768
01:45:16.850 --> 01:45:19.012
"All right, we're preparing our things to--

2769
01:45:19.012 --> 01:45:21.326
"Beauregard, did you need something?"

2770
01:45:22.234 --> 01:45:24.326
MARISHA: Just...

2771
01:45:24.326 --> 01:45:26.517
be suspicious of everybody.

2772
01:45:27.488 --> 01:45:29.262
MATT: "I am."

2773
01:45:29.262 --> 01:45:32.150
MARISHA: I don't know who's a part of all this.

2774
01:45:32.150 --> 01:45:34.438
MATT: "That's the problem with cults."

2775
01:45:34.438 --> 01:45:35.451
MARISHA: Okay.

2776
01:45:35.451 --> 01:45:37.774
MATT: "Annoying.

2777
01:45:37.774 --> 01:45:39.658
"We'll keep a watch. Thank you."

2778
01:45:40.867 --> 01:45:45.406
TRAVIS: Can I sidle over to Caleb and just quietly ask him

2779
01:45:45.406 --> 01:45:49.045
if he's all right, if he knows anyone in this room.

2780
01:45:50.470 --> 01:45:54.228
LIAM: Have I recognized either the garb of,

2781
01:45:54.228 --> 01:45:55.838
or specific people?

2782
01:45:55.838 --> 01:45:56.997
MATT: Mm-mm.

2783
01:45:56.997 --> 01:45:59.735
I mean, beyond, you know, the bodies on the ground

2784
01:45:59.735 --> 01:46:01.982
that are the Chantry's dress--

2785
01:46:01.982 --> 01:46:04.209
LIAM: You can assume his antennas
are just going woo-woo-woo.

2786
01:46:04.209 --> 01:46:05.226
MATT: Yeah.

2787
01:46:06.423 --> 01:46:07.525
By the way, Caleb has antennas,

2788
01:46:07.525 --> 01:46:09.989
I don't know I guys got that.

2789
01:46:09.989 --> 01:46:12.577
Yeah, nothing catches your attention.

2790
01:46:12.577 --> 01:46:15.218
SAM: I will ask Caleb,

2791
01:46:15.218 --> 01:46:18.468
do you think I should like,

2792
01:46:18.468 --> 01:46:21.201
transform into a non-gobliny sort of thing?

2793
01:46:21.201 --> 01:46:24.780
Or is that going to take too much attention over here?

2794
01:46:24.780 --> 01:46:28.263
TALIESIN: I think at this point we're just going to be--

2795
01:46:28.263 --> 01:46:29.770
LIAM: Right out in the open.

2796
01:46:29.770 --> 01:46:32.370
SAM: Mm-hmm.
TALIESIN: We're here now, aren't we?

2797
01:46:32.370 --> 01:46:34.239
MATT: You do gather, at the very least,

2798
01:46:34.239 --> 01:46:35.617
I mean, there are stares.

2799
01:46:35.617 --> 01:46:38.763
People aren't going to not stare at a civilized goblin

2800
01:46:38.763 --> 01:46:41.690
in the middle of the capital of the Empire.

2801
01:46:42.707 --> 01:46:45.386
But based on what Kathedoc had said,

2802
01:46:45.386 --> 01:46:50.337
between Pumat, Kathedoc, you're not unknown figures

2803
01:46:50.337 --> 01:46:52.590
to the people that are here.

2804
01:46:53.531 --> 01:46:55.722
You know, as far as like on a large scale trusted,

2805
01:46:55.722 --> 01:46:56.555
you don't know yet.

2806
01:46:56.555 --> 01:46:57.833
But you gather, while people are staring,

2807
01:46:57.833 --> 01:47:00.148
they're not, like, scowling and looking to run up

2808
01:47:00.148 --> 01:47:02.565
and arrest the goblin.
SAM: Cool.

2809
01:47:04.191 --> 01:47:07.017
ASHLEY: Is the cloak still on the ground?

2810
01:47:07.017 --> 01:47:08.460
Or did that disappear as well?

2811
01:47:08.460 --> 01:47:10.221
MATT: There are chunks of the cloak you can see,

2812
01:47:10.221 --> 01:47:12.524
but most of it's burned away.

2813
01:47:12.524 --> 01:47:15.326
The inferno that incinerated the Laughing Hand

2814
01:47:15.326 --> 01:47:17.779
took most of the clothing with it,

2815
01:47:17.779 --> 01:47:20.295
and it was just this statue-esque figure,

2816
01:47:20.295 --> 01:47:23.545
column of ash, that loosely resembled the Laughing Hand

2817
01:47:23.545 --> 01:47:25.386
until it was scattered.

2818
01:47:25.386 --> 01:47:28.833
ASHLEY: I'd like to go up and take some of the pieces

2819
01:47:28.833 --> 01:47:29.928
of his cloak.

2820
01:47:29.928 --> 01:47:31.833
MATT: Okay, you gather, they're small pieces,

2821
01:47:31.833 --> 01:47:33.676
maybe no more than the size of your hand or so,

2822
01:47:33.676 --> 01:47:36.034
and they're most blackened and curled

2823
01:47:36.034 --> 01:47:38.673
where the thick, heavy threads have pulled back

2824
01:47:38.673 --> 01:47:40.948
from the flames, but you gather a few pieces.

2825
01:47:40.948 --> 01:47:42.514
ASHLEY: I gather them and...

2826
01:47:44.330 --> 01:47:46.506
I'm going to put them in my book.

2827
01:47:46.506 --> 01:47:48.130
MATT: Okay.

2828
01:47:48.130 --> 01:47:50.493
ASHLEY: Close my book and put it back in my bag.

2829
01:47:50.493 --> 01:47:51.425
MATT: All right.

2830
01:47:51.425 --> 01:47:53.694
MARISHA: Can I go over to the bodies of the cultists

2831
01:47:53.694 --> 01:47:55.894
that are laid out?
MATT: Yes.

2832
01:47:55.894 --> 01:48:00.747
MARISHA: I just take a minute to inspect them,

2833
01:48:00.747 --> 01:48:04.018
see if there's any type of parchment,

2834
01:48:04.018 --> 01:48:08.435
any unifying insignias, jewelry, anything on them.

2835
01:48:09.714 --> 01:48:11.853
MATT: Sure, make an investigation check.

2836
01:48:11.853 --> 01:48:13.303
TALIESIN: Boop.

2837
01:48:14.219 --> 01:48:15.821
MARISHA: Was that a Guidance?

2838
01:48:15.821 --> 01:48:17.682
MATT: Boop is the universal symbol for Guidance, Marisha.

2839
01:48:17.682 --> 01:48:18.515
TALIESIN: That's how he Guidances,

2840
01:48:18.515 --> 01:48:19.881
I just go boop.
MATT: You just got booped!

2841
01:48:20.832 --> 01:48:22.083
MARISHA: This fucking thing.

2842
01:48:22.083 --> 01:48:25.583
You saw, I really do, I really fucking do.

2843
01:48:26.573 --> 01:48:28.121
Adding a d4.

2844
01:48:28.121 --> 01:48:29.950
TRAVIS: 17, ah, six.

2845
01:48:29.950 --> 01:48:31.967
MARISHA: Okay, 16 total.

2846
01:48:34.280 --> 01:48:36.709
16 total-- what just happened?

2847
01:48:36.709 --> 01:48:39.252
MATT: I turned off the lighting, because we're not
in the battlefield anymore.

2848
01:48:39.252 --> 01:48:41.551
LIAM: You blacked out for like two minutes, are you okay?

2849
01:48:41.551 --> 01:48:43.116
(laughter)

2850
01:48:43.116 --> 01:48:43.993
SAM: It's Tuesday.

2851
01:48:43.993 --> 01:48:46.742
MATT: You begin to go through the pockets.

2852
01:48:46.742 --> 01:48:48.879
You quickly realize that all of these bodies

2853
01:48:48.879 --> 01:48:50.990
have already been checked.

2854
01:48:50.990 --> 01:48:53.000
The investigation has been underway,

2855
01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:56.649
and the Crownsguard and the Righteous Brand that are around,

2856
01:48:56.649 --> 01:48:58.204
it looks like they've already gone through

2857
01:48:58.204 --> 01:49:00.300
and grabbed things for their investigation.

2858
01:49:00.300 --> 01:49:05.284
Looking at the people, there's no, what you can discern,

2859
01:49:06.318 --> 01:49:08.249
like tattoos or markings or anything

2860
01:49:08.249 --> 01:49:09.729
that is unified about them, and most of them

2861
01:49:09.729 --> 01:49:12.167
just look like people.

2862
01:49:12.167 --> 01:49:15.970
The ages range from early 20s, impressionable youth

2863
01:49:15.970 --> 01:49:20.509
to, you know, older folks that look a bit, you know,

2864
01:49:20.509 --> 01:49:24.407
haggard and weathered, by just time and the elements.

2865
01:49:24.407 --> 01:49:26.470
I mean, the most frustrating aspect of cultists

2866
01:49:26.470 --> 01:49:30.800
is sometimes they just look like the person next door.

2867
01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:32.546
MARISHA: I'm going to look at the Righteous Brand.

2868
01:49:32.546 --> 01:49:33.921
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: Anyone looking shifty,

2869
01:49:33.921 --> 01:49:35.281
anyone looking nervous,

2870
01:49:35.281 --> 01:49:37.524
anyone looking like they don't want to get caught?

2871
01:49:37.524 --> 01:49:39.889
Anyone looking like they're too close to the investigation?

2872
01:49:39.889 --> 01:49:42.577
I've been watching a lot of Forensic Files.

2873
01:49:42.577 --> 01:49:44.279
MATT: Make an insight check.

2874
01:49:44.279 --> 01:49:47.430
TRAVIS: Anybody carrying crystal meth in their butt cheeks?

2875
01:49:47.430 --> 01:49:49.450
(laughter)

2876
01:49:49.450 --> 01:49:51.776
MATT: Second soldier's clenching real hard.

2877
01:49:51.776 --> 01:49:53.272
LIAM: With his Pu-muscles?

2878
01:49:53.272 --> 01:49:56.212
TRAVIS: (laughs)
MARISHA: 20 total.

2879
01:49:56.212 --> 01:49:58.653
MATT: 20 total.
LAURA: Beat me to it like by--

2880
01:49:58.653 --> 01:50:02.209
MATT: In the way that you're looking for, no.

2881
01:50:02.209 --> 01:50:04.858
I mean, there are soldiers that are curious,

2882
01:50:04.858 --> 01:50:06.924
partially just because of the odd company in the chamber,

2883
01:50:06.924 --> 01:50:09.256
the massacre that's happened, you know,

2884
01:50:09.256 --> 01:50:10.995
they don't have all the information.

2885
01:50:10.995 --> 01:50:12.603
They don't know anything about the Chained Oblivion,

2886
01:50:12.603 --> 01:50:13.903
they don't know anything about this.

2887
01:50:13.903 --> 01:50:15.011
A lot of these soldiers just got here

2888
01:50:15.011 --> 01:50:16.994
and were given instructions to try and find things

2889
01:50:16.994 --> 01:50:20.393
and look around, and you can see them, you know,

2890
01:50:20.393 --> 01:50:22.502
shifty in a sense that they're watching you intently

2891
01:50:22.502 --> 01:50:24.032
and they're looking for any other exits

2892
01:50:24.032 --> 01:50:27.150
and making sure that nobody who's not allowed to be here

2893
01:50:27.150 --> 01:50:29.866
is entering the scene of this battle,

2894
01:50:29.866 --> 01:50:32.950
but nobody triggers your...

2895
01:50:32.950 --> 01:50:37.244
your brain in the way that you're--

2896
01:50:37.244 --> 01:50:41.500
you'd be worried about them being unnaturally nervous.

2897
01:50:41.500 --> 01:50:44.450
MARISHA: I just look at the ones
that are looking at me, just--

2898
01:50:49.466 --> 01:50:51.300
SAM: Hey.

2899
01:50:51.300 --> 01:50:54.208
Do we have any privacy, or are we--

2900
01:50:54.208 --> 01:50:56.361
TRAVIS: Not much.
SAM: -- in the open? Okay.

2901
01:50:56.361 --> 01:50:59.088
MATT: The marshal's like 15 feet from you.

2902
01:50:59.088 --> 01:51:01.906
LIAM: Caleb, who is covered in his own blood

2903
01:51:01.906 --> 01:51:04.433
and lots of ooze and is pretty fucked up,

2904
01:51:04.433 --> 01:51:05.897
standing between Nott and Fjord

2905
01:51:05.897 --> 01:51:08.201
just is looking at the room and says:

2906
01:51:08.201 --> 01:51:11.343
It is going to be such an interesting day.

2907
01:51:12.410 --> 01:51:14.805
There are so many people to meet.

2908
01:51:15.746 --> 01:51:17.832
TRAVIS: Here in the city?

2909
01:51:17.832 --> 01:51:20.165
TALIESIN: I hadn't thought about it.

2910
01:51:23.013 --> 01:51:25.696
TRAVIS: If we have the chance,

2911
01:51:25.696 --> 01:51:28.620
would you prefer to not be here?

2912
01:51:30.131 --> 01:51:31.714
LIAM: I love this city.

2913
01:51:34.244 --> 01:51:36.958
LAURA: I am robot.
TRAVIS: Glad to hear it.

2914
01:51:36.958 --> 01:51:38.735
Glad to hear it.

2915
01:51:38.735 --> 01:51:40.621
MATT: "Are you ready?"
LAURA: Yes.

2916
01:51:40.621 --> 01:51:42.288
LIAM: So ready.
SAM: Yes.

2917
01:51:42.288 --> 01:51:44.894
LAURA: Beep bop boop.

2918
01:51:44.894 --> 01:51:47.142
MATT: The marshal gives you a curious look.

2919
01:51:47.142 --> 01:51:49.792
TRAVIS: She was hit very intensely in this fight.

2920
01:51:49.792 --> 01:51:51.356
MATT: "I can see that.

2921
01:51:51.356 --> 01:51:52.742
"Come."

2922
01:51:52.742 --> 01:51:55.898
And you can see now, a troop of about

2923
01:51:55.898 --> 01:51:58.260
10 Righteous Brand soldiers accompany you guys,

2924
01:51:58.260 --> 01:52:00.347
flanking to the sides and back.

2925
01:52:00.347 --> 01:52:02.407
Keeping about a five-foot distance from you,

2926
01:52:02.407 --> 01:52:03.829
they're not shoulder to shoulder,

2927
01:52:03.829 --> 01:52:06.312
but they're definitely keeping you...

2928
01:52:07.353 --> 01:52:08.936
encircled a bit.

2929
01:52:08.936 --> 01:52:12.576
You're being herded, and led out of the cathedral

2930
01:52:12.576 --> 01:52:16.816
into the now rainy streets of Rexxentrum.

2931
01:52:16.816 --> 01:52:18.350
And we'll go ahead and take a break.

2932
01:52:18.350 --> 01:52:20.755
(groaning)

2933
01:52:20.755 --> 01:52:23.908
ASHLEY: I don't want to take a break!

2934
01:52:23.908 --> 01:52:26.245
MATT: It's okay.
LIAM: Liam runs up the street.

2935
01:52:26.245 --> 01:52:29.914
MATT: (laughs)

2936
01:52:29.914 --> 01:52:31.619
All righty, we'll be back here in a minute

2937
01:52:31.619 --> 01:52:33.917
and see this next element of the story.

2938
01:52:33.917 --> 01:52:35.962
In the meantime, we do have our giveaway for tonight

2939
01:52:35.962 --> 01:52:38.985
from our friends at Wyrmwood.

2940
01:52:38.985 --> 01:52:41.854
This is a Bolivian rosewood dice tray,

2941
01:52:41.854 --> 01:52:44.219
with leather interior, from our friends from Wyrmwood.

2942
01:52:44.219 --> 01:52:47.215
It's awesome, it's got good function, as you've seen here.

2943
01:52:47.215 --> 01:52:50.422
LAURA: I think that's what I have.

2944
01:52:50.422 --> 01:52:52.834
MATT: I think it is, yeah.

2945
01:52:52.834 --> 01:52:54.584
It's what Laura uses.

2946
01:52:55.515 --> 01:52:57.810
So one lucky winner in the chat will get this.

2947
01:52:57.810 --> 01:53:00.300
The word tonight is "punished."

2948
01:53:00.300 --> 01:53:01.357
LAURA: Punished.

2949
01:53:01.357 --> 01:53:02.607
MATT: "Punished."

2950
01:53:03.488 --> 01:53:06.013
Enter it once and once only, more than once,

2951
01:53:06.013 --> 01:53:07.124
you'll be disqualified in the chat,

2952
01:53:07.124 --> 01:53:09.116
and once again, it's for U.S. and Canada only,

2953
01:53:09.116 --> 01:53:10.648
excluding Quebec, because of stupid laws.

2954
01:53:10.648 --> 01:53:12.150
We'll come back here shortly with the winner.

2955
01:53:12.150 --> 01:53:13.269
We'll see you guys in a little bit. (click)

2956
01:53:13.269 --> 01:53:15.060

WILL: Hey everyone, the insanely talented Will Friedle here.

2977
01:54:08.077 --> 01:54:09.369
I'm excited to announce that I have

2978
01:54:09.369 --> 01:54:10.752
a new late night talk show coming to

2979
01:54:10.752 --> 01:54:12.480
the Critical Role YouTube channel

2980
01:54:12.480 --> 01:54:14.991
on Wednesdays called Mini Primetime.

2981
01:54:14.991 --> 01:54:17.898
It's brought to you by the same creators as that one show

2982
01:54:17.898 --> 01:54:21.039
with the hippie kid with the bracelets, whatever that is.

2983
01:54:21.039 --> 01:54:24.404
Anyway, my show, Mini Primetime, is a mini painting show

2984
01:54:24.404 --> 01:54:27.462
for beginners and veterans alike where this handsome face

2985
01:54:27.462 --> 01:54:28.766
teaches the Critical Role cast

2986
01:54:28.766 --> 01:54:30.665
how to paint their own Mighty Nein minis.

2987
01:54:30.665 --> 01:54:32.785
We're going to be focusing on specific techniques

2988
01:54:32.785 --> 01:54:35.564
like fades, small detail work, and taking your mini

2989
01:54:35.564 --> 01:54:37.508
to the next level by adding to your base.

2990
01:54:37.508 --> 01:54:40.907
So look for it soon on Critical Role's YouTube.

2991
01:54:40.907 --> 01:54:44.067
Critical Role, what is that, what is even a Critical Role?

2992
01:54:44.067 --> 01:54:47.900
Oh, that's right, that was the show with Kash.

2993
01:54:57.749 --> 01:55:00.749
(upbeat jazz music)

2994
01:55:13.539 --> 01:55:16.463
TRAVIS (V.O.): Last time on Yee-Haw Game Ranch.

2995
01:55:16.463 --> 01:55:18.112
TRAVIS: Look around you, Brian, fuck!

2996
01:55:18.112 --> 01:55:20.421
This place is a winter wonderland!

2997
01:55:20.421 --> 01:55:22.550
BRIAN: Can I open a present?
TRAVIS: No, don't fucking touch that.

2998
01:55:22.550 --> 01:55:26.427
FLINT: What in tarnation's got you so gosh-darn cheery,

2999
01:55:26.427 --> 01:55:30.251
you disintegrating Stretch Armstrong doll?

3000
01:55:30.251 --> 01:55:32.735
TRAVIS: (laughs) What's wrong with the wing?

3001
01:55:32.735 --> 01:55:35.259
BRIAN: Wait, is that--

3002
01:55:35.259 --> 01:55:38.130
FLINT: It's me, Flint Westwood.

3003
01:55:38.130 --> 01:55:39.539
TRAVIS: (laughs)

3004
01:55:39.539 --> 01:55:41.847
Hey, Flint Westwood!

3005
01:55:41.847 --> 01:55:44.686
Oh man, what have you been up to? We missed you.

3006
01:55:44.686 --> 01:55:48.506
FLINT: Terry tells me you got in a tussle with Bast'Alar.

3007
01:55:48.506 --> 01:55:50.775
BRIAN: It all happened so fast, to be honest with you,

3008
01:55:50.775 --> 01:55:55.768
and Bast'Alar had some sort of eldritch being

3009
01:55:55.768 --> 01:55:58.671
named Specimen X.
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah.

3010
01:55:58.671 --> 01:56:01.725
FLINT: This is worse than I could ever imagine.

3011
01:56:01.725 --> 01:56:06.417
The guardians of Ov, the splicing of the god particle,

3012
01:56:06.417 --> 01:56:08.554
the end of time.

3013
01:56:08.554 --> 01:56:10.081
BRIAN: Wait, wait, wait, wait.

3014
01:56:10.081 --> 01:56:12.305
The guardians of Ov, the splicing of the what?

3015
01:56:12.305 --> 01:56:16.477
FLINT: Before the hands of time made their first tick,

3016
01:56:16.477 --> 01:56:20.358
the Ov created a high council of gods

3017
01:56:20.358 --> 01:56:23.905
to help with the creation of the Gameverse.

3018
01:56:23.905 --> 01:56:26.653
Once all the work had been done,

3019
01:56:26.653 --> 01:56:29.760
the gods became restless and spiteful,

3020
01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:32.462
and turned against Ov!

3021
01:56:32.462 --> 01:56:33.959
This was known--

3022
01:56:33.959 --> 01:56:36.116
TRAVIS: (laughs)

3023
01:56:36.116 --> 01:56:38.603
FLINT: -- as the War of the Gods.

3024
01:56:38.603 --> 01:56:41.140
To change the tides in their favor,

3025
01:56:41.140 --> 01:56:44.077
the Ov created four great titans

3026
01:56:44.077 --> 01:56:46.548
to keep the other gods at bay.

3027
01:56:46.548 --> 01:56:50.474
Once peace came to the world, these guardians of Ov

3028
01:56:50.474 --> 01:56:54.815
were buried deep beneath the Dye'mor.

3029
01:56:54.815 --> 01:56:55.749
TRAVIS: Wow.

3030
01:56:55.749 --> 01:56:58.492
FLINT: It's been rumored that Bast'Alar is searching

3031
01:56:58.492 --> 01:57:02.420
for the DNA of these beasts, and experimenting

3032
01:57:02.420 --> 01:57:05.320
with cyber-eldritch gene splicing

3033
01:57:05.320 --> 01:57:07.767
with the help of Void Tech Industries.

3034
01:57:07.767 --> 01:57:10.000
TRAVIS: Wait, we're over here.
BRIAN: Void Tech Industries?

3035
01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.468
FLINT: I've been training soldiers at Yee-Haw Fantasy Ranch

3036
01:57:12.468 --> 01:57:16.025
for a time now, and I thought I was a long way

3037
01:57:16.025 --> 01:57:17.403
from letting them out in the world,

3038
01:57:17.403 --> 01:57:21.060
but it looks like we need to exhaust every option.

3039
01:57:21.060 --> 01:57:22.185
Knights!

3040
01:57:23.139 --> 01:57:26.119
All right, so this one that looks like a wild stallion

3041
01:57:26.119 --> 01:57:29.793
with nice teeth is Sir Matthew Mercer,

3042
01:57:29.793 --> 01:57:34.378
and this personified firecracker is Sir Marisha Ray.

3043
01:57:34.378 --> 01:57:36.595
May they bring you the extra support

3044
01:57:36.595 --> 01:57:38.987
you need in your adventure.

3045
01:57:38.987 --> 01:57:40.617
TRAVIS: Get away!

3046
01:57:40.617 --> 01:57:44.714
Don't touch my fucking silver dollar pancakes!

3047
01:57:44.714 --> 01:57:46.570
Rooty tooty, fresh 'n' fruity.

3048
01:57:46.570 --> 01:57:48.744
MARISHA: (babbling)

3049
01:57:50.669 --> 01:57:52.398
Fucking-- oh!

3050
01:57:52.398 --> 01:57:55.667
TRAVIS: God, am I the best there's ever been? Woo!

3051
01:57:55.667 --> 01:57:58.154
BRIAN: Can you take from someone else's plate?

3052
01:57:58.154 --> 01:58:00.534
MARISHA: Don't encourage him.
MATT: I'm not, it was--

3053
01:58:00.534 --> 01:58:02.338
I'm not going to turn him down,
if I see a hand, I five it.

3054
01:58:02.338 --> 01:58:03.963
TRAVIS: Yeah, look, he's guarding me.
MATT: That's the rules!

3055
01:58:03.963 --> 01:58:08.686
You guard your guy, all right, this guy, we got it on lock.

3056
01:58:08.686 --> 01:58:10.170
Bottom right--
BRIAN: Bottom right-hand corner.

3057
01:58:10.170 --> 01:58:13.192
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay.
BRIAN: You guys get that bottom.

3058
01:58:13.192 --> 01:58:14.752
TRAVIS: Go to the top!

3059
01:58:14.752 --> 01:58:16.604
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay!
TRAVIS: Now go to the lower left!

3060
01:58:16.604 --> 01:58:17.497
BRIAN: Stop, stop, stop!

3061
01:58:17.497 --> 01:58:18.522
TRAVIS: Fucking Peach!

3062
01:58:18.522 --> 01:58:20.762
Get your shit together!

3063
01:58:20.762 --> 01:58:21.874
MARISHA: Okay.

3064
01:58:21.874 --> 01:58:24.256
TRAVIS: Honestly, those three balloons would not lift her.

3065
01:58:24.256 --> 01:58:25.548
That is not nearly enough helium.

3066
01:58:25.548 --> 01:58:27.021
MATT: This has broken my immersion.

3067
01:58:27.021 --> 01:58:29.705
MARISHA: We are in a helium crisis, Toadette.

3068
01:58:29.705 --> 01:58:31.216
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's irre-fucking-sponsible.

3069
01:58:31.216 --> 01:58:33.257
MARISHA: What are you doing?

3070
01:58:33.257 --> 01:58:35.249
TRAVIS: Think of Mother Gaia!

3071
01:58:35.249 --> 01:58:37.285
(laughter)

3072
01:58:37.285 --> 01:58:39.368
I'm calling it right now, you're rolling a five.

3073
01:58:39.368 --> 01:58:42.309
It's going to be five, I got a five, anybody else?

3074
01:58:43.558 --> 01:58:44.608
BRIAN: Two.

3075
01:58:44.608 --> 01:58:47.760
(shouting)

3076
01:58:47.760 --> 01:58:49.807
TRAVIS: I'm just saying!

3077
01:58:49.807 --> 01:58:52.508
Let's go to Vegas!
MARISHA: Vegas, Vegas, Vegas!

3078
01:58:52.508 --> 01:58:54.579
TRAVIS: Stay away, stay away, stay away!

3079
01:58:54.579 --> 01:58:56.225
MARISHA: Shit.

3080
01:58:56.225 --> 01:58:57.708
TRAVIS: Is there like a boost?

3081
01:58:57.708 --> 01:58:59.169
Is there a boost?

3082
01:58:59.169 --> 01:59:01.409
MATT: I like how Brian is just playing

3083
01:59:01.409 --> 01:59:02.738
French tactics here.

3084
01:59:02.738 --> 01:59:05.068
MARISHA: (laughs)

3085
01:59:05.068 --> 01:59:08.953
Look, it's Travis, it's about Travis, okay?

3086
01:59:08.953 --> 01:59:10.361
It's really about Travis.
TRAVIS: All the way back to my

3087
01:59:10.361 --> 01:59:12.238
Will Smith Independence Days.
MARISHA: Son of a--

3088
01:59:12.238 --> 01:59:13.286
TRAVIS: Ooh, yeah!
MARISHA: -- bitch!

3089
01:59:13.286 --> 01:59:15.011
BRIAN: Hold right there in the corner, right there!

3090
01:59:15.011 --> 01:59:16.224
You got this, Marisha.

3091
01:59:16.224 --> 01:59:19.029
(screaming and shouting)

3092
01:59:19.029 --> 01:59:20.509
(Marisha groans)

3093
01:59:20.509 --> 01:59:22.466
TRAVIS: Which way do I go?

3094
01:59:22.466 --> 01:59:23.299
Straight?

3095
01:59:26.113 --> 01:59:28.654
MARISHA: Why not down? What-- oh.

3096
01:59:28.654 --> 01:59:29.487
BRIAN: Special event.

3097
01:59:29.487 --> 01:59:31.790
MARISHA: What did you do to us, Jerry?

3098
01:59:31.790 --> 01:59:35.423
MATT: No! I finally made it this far up the track!
MARISHA: Fucking A, Jerry!

3099
01:59:36.820 --> 01:59:39.562
Goddamn it, Jerry!

3100
01:59:40.514 --> 01:59:43.353
BRIAN: I moved, I moved in time.
TRAVIS: I'm so pissed right now.

3101
01:59:43.353 --> 01:59:45.633
BRIAN: I moved in time.
TRAVIS: Why did you tell me to go straight?

3102
01:59:45.633 --> 01:59:48.235
MATT: It took me three turns to get there, by the way.

3103
01:59:48.235 --> 01:59:49.603
BRIAN: Got to finish soft.

3104
01:59:49.603 --> 01:59:51.422
MARISHA: Oh shit. Oh shit.

3105
01:59:54.186 --> 01:59:55.716
TRAVIS: Yeah we do.

3106
01:59:55.716 --> 01:59:58.097
MARISHA: (laughs)

3107
01:59:58.097 --> 02:00:00.187
TRAVIS: Go to sleep, go to sleep.
Go to sleep go to sleep.

3108
02:00:00.187 --> 02:00:03.158
MATT: (laughs)

3109
02:00:03.158 --> 02:00:05.975
(yelling)

3110
02:00:05.975 --> 02:00:07.187
TRAVIS: Finish!

3111
02:00:07.187 --> 02:00:09.329
MATT: There's a graph, guys.

3112
02:00:09.329 --> 02:00:11.771
(laughter)

3113
02:00:11.771 --> 02:00:13.235
BRIAN: I don't see the need for that.

3114
02:00:13.235 --> 02:00:14.464
MATT: For those that need--

3115
02:00:14.464 --> 02:00:16.536
TRAVIS: You never even got off the ground.

3116
02:00:16.536 --> 02:00:19.213
(laughter)

3117
02:00:19.213 --> 02:00:21.579
Success, mild success,

3118
02:00:21.579 --> 02:00:23.845
fucking sucks.

3119
02:00:26.279 --> 02:00:28.220
(upbeat Mario music)

3120
02:00:29.448 --> 02:00:30.523
TRAVIS: Yeah!

3121
02:00:32.443 --> 02:00:34.074
MARISHA: Oh, it's music.

3122
02:00:34.074 --> 02:00:35.883
Oh, that's fun.

3123
02:00:35.883 --> 02:00:38.066
BRIAN: We can't hear the TV.

3124
02:00:38.066 --> 02:00:40.649
(upbeat music)

3125
02:00:47.512 --> 02:00:49.362
TRAVIS: You got the booty?

3126
02:00:53.185 --> 02:00:56.089
MATT: God, what's going on?! I lost the beat!

3127
02:00:56.089 --> 02:00:59.397
TRAVIS: Oh, it finally [inaudible]. Oh fucking--

3128
02:00:59.397 --> 02:01:01.331
BRIAN: God damn you, Seabiscuit.

3129
02:01:01.331 --> 02:01:02.431
TRAVIS: Holy shit!

3130
02:01:02.431 --> 02:01:03.947
BRIAN: Fuck you, Seabiscuit.

3131
02:01:07.503 --> 02:01:09.759
TALIESIN: Like a symphony playing to an empty theater,

3132
02:01:09.759 --> 02:01:13.178
Critical Role dines alone without its audience.

3133
02:01:13.178 --> 02:01:17.430
Yes, that validating and most enthusiastic congregation

3134
02:01:17.430 --> 02:01:21.033
on the other side of the fourth wall.

3135
02:01:21.033 --> 02:01:24.590
And what is this fourth wall, separating the viewer

3136
02:01:24.590 --> 02:01:26.081
from the creator?

3137
02:01:26.081 --> 02:01:29.460
A portal to an often-sought point of connection, or...

3138
02:01:30.585 --> 02:01:33.252
the Twitch Subscription Zone?

3139
02:01:33.252 --> 02:01:35.852
On the rare occasion that you miss the live bacchanal

3140
02:01:35.852 --> 02:01:39.613
boasted by the rag-tag group of thespians on Thursday night,

3141
02:01:39.613 --> 02:01:41.821
you may always view the show on demand,

3142
02:01:41.821 --> 02:01:44.554
in the shadowland known as...

3143
02:01:44.554 --> 02:01:46.729
The Twitch Subscription Zone.

3144
02:01:46.729 --> 02:01:48.979
Picture, if you will, the necessary pieces

3145
02:01:48.979 --> 02:01:51.978
to complete a jigsaw puzzle, but it's up to you

3146
02:01:51.978 --> 02:01:54.414
to choose how it will be solved.

3147
02:01:54.414 --> 02:01:57.990
You could, of course, subscribe with your debt rectangle,

3148
02:01:57.990 --> 02:02:01.162
but many more divergent paths lie before you.

3149
02:02:01.162 --> 02:02:03.682
Perhaps you found yourself in possession of

3150
02:02:03.682 --> 02:02:06.537
an Amazon Prime account.

3151
02:02:06.537 --> 02:02:08.206
You would then wake up to discover

3152
02:02:08.206 --> 02:02:10.386
a free Twitch subscription each month

3153
02:02:10.386 --> 02:02:12.386
for a channel of your choosing.

3154
02:02:12.386 --> 02:02:15.990
But this artifact demands renewal, for you must resubscribe

3155
02:02:15.990 --> 02:02:19.862
each month to quench its unyielding thirst.

3156
02:02:19.862 --> 02:02:21.923
One need not walk alone.

3157
02:02:21.923 --> 02:02:23.607
Those who have already found their way

3158
02:02:23.607 --> 02:02:25.639
can illuminate the path for others

3159
02:02:25.639 --> 02:02:28.853
via the Gift a Sub button on Twitch.

3160
02:02:29.978 --> 02:02:32.794
Critical Role is humbled by your subscription,

3161
02:02:32.794 --> 02:02:36.537
and wishes to thank you from
behind the thin veil of this...

3162
02:02:36.537 --> 02:02:37.920
fourth wall.

3163
02:02:37.920 --> 02:02:41.524
We hope you enjoy our content as much as we enjoy making it.

3164
02:02:41.524 --> 02:02:44.290
And so ends another meandering digression,

3165
02:02:44.290 --> 02:02:47.805
a complicated parody promo down an indistinct highway,

3166
02:02:47.805 --> 02:02:49.613
to the region we call...

3167
02:02:50.521 --> 02:02:52.929
the Twitch Subscription Zone.

3168
02:02:54.364 --> 02:02:56.864
(eerie music)

3169
02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:02.423
TALIESIN (V.O.): You will subscribe.

3170
02:03:03.765 --> 02:03:08.749
Twitch Prime subscribe, gift subscribe.

3171
02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:15.071
Subscribe.

3172
02:03:20.595 --> 02:03:23.345
(dramatic music)

3173
02:17:21.766 --> 02:17:23.238
MATT: And welcome back.

3174
02:17:23.238 --> 02:17:26.647
So-- that's a new one, velcro taint's a new one.

3175
02:17:26.647 --> 02:17:27.480
Respect.

3176
02:17:29.383 --> 02:17:30.538
Before we get back, do have our winner

3177
02:17:30.538 --> 02:17:32.665
of our Wyrmwood giveaway. The winner is...

3178
02:17:33.631 --> 02:17:35.823
Snarkysloane.

3179
02:17:35.823 --> 02:17:37.875
Snarkysloane, congratulations, we'll go ahead

3180
02:17:37.875 --> 02:17:42.528
and get you your Wyrmwood giveaway as soon as possible.

3181
02:17:42.528 --> 02:17:45.286
So last we left off,

3182
02:17:46.952 --> 02:17:48.291
you guys have stepped out

3183
02:17:48.291 --> 02:17:51.568
into the raining cobblestone streets

3184
02:17:51.568 --> 02:17:56.031
of the southern area beneath the Shimmer Ward

3185
02:17:56.031 --> 02:17:58.149
within the city of Rexxentrum, being led by

3186
02:17:58.149 --> 02:18:03.132
a host of Righteous Brand soldiers and the marshal.

3187
02:18:04.964 --> 02:18:08.714
So as Marshal Ishmara brings you guys along,

3188
02:18:10.301 --> 02:18:14.895
the streets you see in front of you are barren of townsfolk.

3189
02:18:14.895 --> 02:18:17.564
Most buildings are closed up and silent.

3190
02:18:17.564 --> 02:18:20.485
It's eerie, but the rain is somewhat welcoming,

3191
02:18:20.485 --> 02:18:23.746
and Yasha, in particular, feeling the rain come down

3192
02:18:23.746 --> 02:18:24.981
and hearing the distant rumble of thunder,

3193
02:18:24.981 --> 02:18:29.199
it seems to be a very cleansing wash and experience.

3194
02:18:29.199 --> 02:18:32.135
This is the first time you've come out into a storm

3195
02:18:32.135 --> 02:18:37.002
in a while under your own will, and it feels nice.

3196
02:18:38.005 --> 02:18:41.254
ASHLEY: I just close my eyes for a minute and

3197
02:18:41.254 --> 02:18:42.472
just let it fall.

3198
02:18:42.472 --> 02:18:43.655
MATT: Okay.

3199
02:18:45.434 --> 02:18:46.509
SAM: Matthew.
MATT: Yes?

3200
02:18:46.509 --> 02:18:50.175
SAM: Are any of the guards halflings?

3201
02:18:51.396 --> 02:18:53.413
MATT: I would say there is one that appears to be shorter

3202
02:18:53.413 --> 02:18:54.863
than the others to a point where it could be

3203
02:18:54.863 --> 02:18:56.531
halfling or gnome, you're not sure.

3204
02:18:56.531 --> 02:18:59.356
SAM: Then never mind.

3205
02:18:59.356 --> 02:19:00.306
MATT: Okay.

3206
02:19:00.306 --> 02:19:02.778
SAM: I won't talk to Beau in Halfling, then.

3207
02:19:02.778 --> 02:19:03.774
(Matt and Sam chuckling)

3208
02:19:03.774 --> 02:19:05.357
MATT: You're uncertain.

3209
02:19:06.813 --> 02:19:10.040
As you're moving through, this eerie calm

3210
02:19:10.040 --> 02:19:13.437
that falls over the city, the intensity that you remember it

3211
02:19:13.437 --> 02:19:15.818
as you came to the cathedral, the sound of distant battle

3212
02:19:15.818 --> 02:19:19.828
and screams and shouts just gives way to silence now.

3213
02:19:19.828 --> 02:19:23.106
You hear some rapid footfalls, and you glance over and see

3214
02:19:23.106 --> 02:19:26.511
another troop of about 15 or so townsguard rush by,

3215
02:19:26.511 --> 02:19:29.071
hurried, but not in a break-neck sprint

3216
02:19:29.071 --> 02:19:30.635
like you had previously encountered.

3217
02:19:30.635 --> 02:19:33.965
It seems while the tension is still high in the city,

3218
02:19:33.965 --> 02:19:38.702
and from the word that you heard earlier from the marshal,

3219
02:19:38.702 --> 02:19:41.655
the Kryn assault is not currently a looming threat

3220
02:19:41.655 --> 02:19:43.238
at this time.

3221
02:19:45.349 --> 02:19:47.671
You're brought a little further south,

3222
02:19:47.671 --> 02:19:49.670
I'm sorry, a little further north,

3223
02:19:49.670 --> 02:19:51.916
approaching the heavy gates that open

3224
02:19:51.916 --> 02:19:55.584
through the towering, pale wall of the Shimmer Ward.

3225
02:19:55.584 --> 02:19:58.288
You do see two slain Kryn soldiers that are stacked

3226
02:19:58.288 --> 02:20:00.517
alongside the edge of the street,

3227
02:20:00.517 --> 02:20:02.240
where about a half-dozen townsguard bodies

3228
02:20:02.240 --> 02:20:05.573
lay piled across the way on the opposite end.

3229
02:20:06.482 --> 02:20:09.448
Quite a bit of death seemed to have happened

3230
02:20:09.448 --> 02:20:12.365
in a short period of time.

3231
02:20:12.365 --> 02:20:13.623
You can see splashes of crimson leaking

3232
02:20:13.623 --> 02:20:16.606
from each of the stacks, but as the rain falls and gathers,

3233
02:20:16.606 --> 02:20:19.211
you can see it beginning to slowly disseminate

3234
02:20:19.211 --> 02:20:23.711
and blend in with the cobblestone ground.

3235
02:20:23.711 --> 02:20:28.243
Several crownsguard present nod towards the marshal

3236
02:20:28.243 --> 02:20:31.415
as you approach and lift the heavy steel gates up

3237
02:20:31.415 --> 02:20:35.410
with a (clicking) as it raises up.

3238
02:20:35.410 --> 02:20:38.410
You've entered the Shimmer Ward, a sprawling region

3239
02:20:38.410 --> 02:20:40.663
of vibrant gardens that carve through the streets

3240
02:20:40.663 --> 02:20:43.241
and neighborhoods like a colorful maze,

3241
02:20:43.241 --> 02:20:46.677
encircling massive estates that house nobility

3242
02:20:46.677 --> 02:20:48.482
and the wealthy elite.

3243
02:20:48.482 --> 02:20:50.807
It reminds you of the Tri-Spires of Zadash,

3244
02:20:50.807 --> 02:20:54.207
only on a much larger, grander,

3245
02:20:54.207 --> 02:20:57.112
kind of oppressive scale.

3246
02:20:57.112 --> 02:20:59.996
To the northwest, you can make out the rising walkways

3247
02:20:59.996 --> 02:21:04.177
and ivory halls of the Soltryce Academy,

3248
02:21:04.177 --> 02:21:07.977
peeking above the surrounding homes and guild halls,

3249
02:21:07.977 --> 02:21:10.590
while the north and northeastern skyline

3250
02:21:10.590 --> 02:21:15.444
gives way to the peaking, climbing towers of the Candles.

3251
02:21:15.444 --> 02:21:17.627
MARISHA: The what?
MATT: The Candles.

3252
02:21:17.627 --> 02:21:19.874
The eight staggering towers that house

3253
02:21:19.874 --> 02:21:22.278
the leaders of the Cerberus Assembly,

3254
02:21:22.278 --> 02:21:24.952
each unique in its design and structure.

3255
02:21:24.952 --> 02:21:27.472
Some seem to bend in impossible ways,

3256
02:21:27.472 --> 02:21:30.400
some are beautifully carved to be smooth and stalwart,

3257
02:21:30.400 --> 02:21:34.261
some seem to have their own offshoot separate, small towers,

3258
02:21:34.261 --> 02:21:37.476
each competing to be unique against the others,

3259
02:21:37.476 --> 02:21:41.217
but lending to this strange series of tall,

3260
02:21:41.217 --> 02:21:44.998
looming tower shapes that consume that side of the horizon.

3261
02:21:44.998 --> 02:21:49.880
LAURA: I just walk up and I grab Caleb's hand,

3262
02:21:49.880 --> 02:21:54.539
and I just say: Hey, we're here with you!

3263
02:21:58.779 --> 02:22:00.410
MATT: These sights only grasp your vision

3264
02:22:00.410 --> 02:22:03.221
for about a moment, though, as your attention comes

3265
02:22:03.221 --> 02:22:06.535
to the destination you walk towards.

3266
02:22:06.535 --> 02:22:11.452
The inner walls of the terrace that holds Castle Ungebroch.

3267
02:22:12.802 --> 02:22:15.559
As you walk to the barrier gatehouse,

3268
02:22:15.559 --> 02:22:18.897
you look upon the dark stone gothic mass

3269
02:22:18.897 --> 02:22:21.407
that is Castle Ungebroch.

3270
02:22:21.407 --> 02:22:24.215
The central, pentagonal stronghold rises up

3271
02:22:24.215 --> 02:22:26.567
like an intricate, jagged monolith,

3272
02:22:26.567 --> 02:22:29.142
symbolizing the Empire's power.

3273
02:22:29.142 --> 02:22:31.070
Numerous pointed spires and battlements

3274
02:22:31.070 --> 02:22:33.943
surround the towers that peer from the bulky castle keep,

3275
02:22:33.943 --> 02:22:36.292
housing intricate, elevated walkways

3276
02:22:36.292 --> 02:22:38.619
and tall, arched windows of stained glass,

3277
02:22:38.619 --> 02:22:41.981
not dissimilar to the cathedral you just left.

3278
02:22:41.981 --> 02:22:45.469
The central castle curtain wall extends in four directions,

3279
02:22:45.469 --> 02:22:47.374
into the surrounding quadrants that resemble

3280
02:22:47.374 --> 02:22:49.469
their own separate strongholds that all attach

3281
02:22:49.469 --> 02:22:51.863
to the main central castle.

3282
02:22:51.863 --> 02:22:54.586
They encompass the entirety of the inside of this terrace,

3283
02:22:54.586 --> 02:22:57.673
within the secondary walls that contain it.

3284
02:22:57.673 --> 02:23:01.487
It's an awe-inspiring citadel of dizzying size.

3285
02:23:01.487 --> 02:23:03.198
Numerous soldiers rush throughout the terrace,

3286
02:23:03.198 --> 02:23:05.211
still driven by the chaos of the day,

3287
02:23:05.211 --> 02:23:07.435
checking with each other, taking commands

3288
02:23:07.435 --> 02:23:12.089
and doing passes around to ensure that, perhaps,

3289
02:23:12.089 --> 02:23:16.335
if the attacks come back, they're ready.

3290
02:23:16.335 --> 02:23:18.040
You're quickly ushered up to the entrance stairs,

3291
02:23:18.040 --> 02:23:20.219
in through the main gate, into the shaded halls

3292
02:23:20.219 --> 02:23:22.209
of the castle itself.

3293
02:23:22.209 --> 02:23:24.317
Recurring sconce torchlight continues to create

3294
02:23:24.317 --> 02:23:28.234
a warm, flickering glow to the tall but thin hallways.

3295
02:23:28.234 --> 02:23:31.455
Your eyes can barely focus on the details of the stonework,

3296
02:23:31.455 --> 02:23:33.213
the decor, and the personnel within

3297
02:23:33.213 --> 02:23:36.890
before you are rushed to a holding vestibule of some kind.

3298
02:23:36.890 --> 02:23:39.456
Barred windows let in the overcast light of the day,

3299
02:23:39.456 --> 02:23:41.878
while stone benches line the walls of the otherwise

3300
02:23:41.878 --> 02:23:44.260
unfurnished chamber.

3301
02:23:44.260 --> 02:23:48.700
As you step in and are gently guided into the room,

3302
02:23:48.700 --> 02:23:51.010
Marshal Ishmara goes, "Please wait here

3303
02:23:51.010 --> 02:23:53.631
"until you are summoned."

3304
02:23:53.631 --> 02:23:56.362
Two of the soldiers step into the chamber,

3305
02:23:56.362 --> 02:23:58.474
the marshal closes the door behind her,

3306
02:23:58.474 --> 02:24:00.174
and those two soldiers remain inside,

3307
02:24:00.174 --> 02:24:03.670
just flanking to the right and left of the door.

3308
02:24:03.670 --> 02:24:06.222
The room itself is about 30 feet by 40 feet,

3309
02:24:06.222 --> 02:24:09.141
it's quite an open space, with benches around it

3310
02:24:09.141 --> 02:24:11.094
on the sides you can use to sit.

3311
02:24:11.094 --> 02:24:13.455
But the space is yours for who knows how long.

3312
02:24:13.455 --> 02:24:14.419
SAM: Oh, we're alone?

3313
02:24:14.419 --> 02:24:16.969
MATT: You're alone except for two--
LAURA: There's guards in here.

3314
02:24:16.969 --> 02:24:18.058
MARISHA: Random guards.

3315
02:24:18.058 --> 02:24:19.240
MATT: Yeah, these are elite townsguard,

3316
02:24:19.240 --> 02:24:20.949
you can see the-- or crownsguard.

3317
02:24:20.949 --> 02:24:22.308
The armor they wear is similar

3318
02:24:22.308 --> 02:24:23.327
to the rest of the crownsguard,

3319
02:24:23.327 --> 02:24:25.779
but much like the marshal, they have elevated,

3320
02:24:25.779 --> 02:24:28.849
signature threads across the cloak,

3321
02:24:28.849 --> 02:24:30.863
and the armor on them appears to be more intricate,

3322
02:24:30.863 --> 02:24:33.668
the helmet wears a feather-type plume

3323
02:24:33.668 --> 02:24:37.766
on the top that signifies their elevated status.

3324
02:24:37.766 --> 02:24:39.647
TRAVIS: I quickly turn to Caleb and I say:

3325
02:24:39.647 --> 02:24:42.084
We're going to rely on your experience here.

3326
02:24:42.084 --> 02:24:46.241
Have you ever been in this chamber before?

3327
02:24:46.241 --> 02:24:47.357
LIAM: I don't imagine I have.

3328
02:24:47.357 --> 02:24:48.723
MATT: You have never been inside the castle.

3329
02:24:48.723 --> 02:24:51.375
LIAM: This is like the fucking Pentagon
where we are right now.

3330
02:24:51.375 --> 02:24:53.078
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

3331
02:24:53.078 --> 02:24:56.173
MARISHA: Do you know who we might be speaking with?

3332
02:24:56.173 --> 02:25:00.032
TRAVIS: Or if they search their visitors?

3333
02:25:00.032 --> 02:25:01.640
TALIESIN: You have a bag.

3334
02:25:01.640 --> 02:25:04.464
LIAM: I don't know who we will be meeting.

3335
02:25:04.464 --> 02:25:07.598
MATT: The only name you heard before was the Prime Arbiter.

3336
02:25:07.598 --> 02:25:08.724
MARISHA: Right.

3337
02:25:08.724 --> 02:25:11.485
TALIESIN: Is there enough time for a
short rest while we're in here?

3338
02:25:11.485 --> 02:25:12.768
MATT: Possibly. You don't know how long

3339
02:25:12.768 --> 02:25:14.160
until you're going to be called, so you can begin

3340
02:25:14.160 --> 02:25:16.007
to try for one, if you'd like.

3341
02:25:16.007 --> 02:25:17.899
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Might as well.

3342
02:25:17.899 --> 02:25:20.828
LIAM: Word will travel fast that we are here.

3343
02:25:20.828 --> 02:25:25.828
LAURA: Do you guys want to-- I'm just going to

3344
02:25:26.021 --> 02:25:29.284
keep my back to the guards and take my symbol

3345
02:25:29.284 --> 02:25:32.752
and put it into the bag of holding, the haversack.

3346
02:25:32.752 --> 02:25:34.054
MATT: (click) Good call.

3347
02:25:34.054 --> 02:25:36.126
TRAVIS: I will do the same.
TALIESIN: Yeah, I will.

3348
02:25:36.126 --> 02:25:40.690
TRAVIS: Slowly we all take a moment to casually walk over

3349
02:25:40.690 --> 02:25:41.956
and deposit--
LAURA: Well, we all sit down

3350
02:25:41.956 --> 02:25:45.615
in, like, a circle and rest, and chat.

3351
02:25:45.615 --> 02:25:47.894
SAM: Maybe I'll just, as everyone's chatting,

3352
02:25:47.894 --> 02:25:50.462
I'm just going to go around and gather everyone's,

3353
02:25:50.462 --> 02:25:52.200
with my sleight of hand.

3354
02:25:52.200 --> 02:25:53.896
LAURA: And just put them into the--

3355
02:25:53.896 --> 02:25:58.271
MARISHA: We make like a purse pile, like at conventions

3356
02:25:58.271 --> 02:26:00.061
when you sit down and you just dump all your shit--

3357
02:26:00.061 --> 02:26:02.851
LAURA: Your bags in the middle and just talk.

3358
02:26:02.851 --> 02:26:04.991
TALIESIN: I'm definitely making tea.

3359
02:26:04.991 --> 02:26:07.952
LIAM: Caleb is going to just sink slide down a wall

3360
02:26:07.952 --> 02:26:10.812
and pull his gore-covered cloak around himself

3361
02:26:10.812 --> 02:26:13.376
and see if he can make it through a short rest.

3362
02:26:13.376 --> 02:26:15.802
I can't remember if we had a short rest

3363
02:26:15.802 --> 02:26:18.333
or if I've had a chance to use Arcane Recovery.

3364
02:26:18.333 --> 02:26:20.348
MATT: I believe you--
LIAM: I have no idea.

3365
02:26:20.348 --> 02:26:21.606
So I'm just not going to.
TRAVIS: We did not,

3366
02:26:21.606 --> 02:26:22.628
because we didn't do it

3367
02:26:22.628 --> 02:26:25.876
before we went down after Nott.

3368
02:26:25.876 --> 02:26:27.929
MATT: I believe you did take a short rest.

3369
02:26:27.929 --> 02:26:28.827
LIAM: I don't know.

3370
02:26:28.827 --> 02:26:29.857
MATT: You did take a short rest on the stairs though, yeah?

3371
02:26:29.857 --> 02:26:30.690
LAURA: Yeah, we did.

3372
02:26:30.690 --> 02:26:32.411
MATT: I think you did use it then.

3373
02:26:32.411 --> 02:26:33.534
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: Okay.

3374
02:26:33.534 --> 02:26:36.674
Well, I'm still doing the same action, I'm sinking down.

3375
02:26:36.674 --> 02:26:37.790
MATT: You got it.

3376
02:26:37.790 --> 02:26:40.251
LAURA: I guess I'll heal if we're taking a short rest.

3377
02:26:40.251 --> 02:26:41.912
TALIESIN: Assuming it finishes.
LAURA: Oh, well we don't know.

3378
02:26:41.912 --> 02:26:43.330
MATT: Assuming it finishes.

3379
02:26:43.330 --> 02:26:44.708
But you guys can--

3380
02:26:44.708 --> 02:26:45.981
SAM: Are we doing a short rest, we don't know--

3381
02:26:45.981 --> 02:26:47.729
MATT: Beginning one, but you have the time

3382
02:26:47.729 --> 02:26:49.980
to talk amongst yourselves and whatever.

3383
02:26:49.980 --> 02:26:51.771
ASHLEY: Are there any windows in this room?

3384
02:26:51.771 --> 02:26:52.756
MATT: There are.

3385
02:26:52.756 --> 02:26:57.756
There are five tall windows on one side of the wall,

3386
02:26:57.756 --> 02:27:00.254
on the wall, the side facing away

3387
02:27:00.254 --> 02:27:02.514
from where you entered.

3388
02:27:02.514 --> 02:27:04.153
It's a long chamber, it's 40 feet on one side

3389
02:27:04.153 --> 02:27:06.238
and 30 feet wide, and these five windows

3390
02:27:06.238 --> 02:27:09.022
are very tall and thin, and they're all matching,

3391
02:27:09.022 --> 02:27:13.305
about maybe 12 feet tall, at its highest peak.

3392
02:27:13.305 --> 02:27:16.391
They're standard windows, there's no color to them,

3393
02:27:16.391 --> 02:27:19.242
they're not stained glass, but they are designed,

3394
02:27:19.242 --> 02:27:20.934
the glass itself refracts it,

3395
02:27:20.934 --> 02:27:22.656
so you can't quite make out the shapes outside,

3396
02:27:22.656 --> 02:27:25.823
just the light and maybe some shadows.

3397
02:27:28.793 --> 02:27:30.419
SAM: Guys--
MATT: They are barred.

3398
02:27:30.419 --> 02:27:32.177
SAM: I was--
TRAVIS: Ah.

3399
02:27:32.177 --> 02:27:34.590
SAM: I was super hurt in that fight,

3400
02:27:34.590 --> 02:27:38.682
and whew, I can't get my head straight.

3401
02:27:41.128 --> 02:27:42.969
Remind me again.

3402
02:27:42.969 --> 02:27:46.955
We are sent by whom to here?

3403
02:27:46.955 --> 02:27:49.782
The guy from Zadash?

3404
02:27:49.782 --> 02:27:52.893
TRAVIS: Cobalt, doot doot.
MARISHA: Cobalt Reserve?

3405
02:27:52.893 --> 02:27:54.238
SAM: Yeah, what's his name again?

3406
02:27:54.238 --> 02:27:55.570
MARISHA: Archivist Zeenoth.

3407
02:27:55.570 --> 02:27:57.890
SAM: Zeenoth, that's right, that's right.

3408
02:27:57.890 --> 02:28:01.131
And that's--
MARISHA: And Expositor Dairon.

3409
02:28:01.131 --> 02:28:05.131
SAM: Yeah, and he sent us here to talk about stuff.

3410
02:28:06.875 --> 02:28:07.708
What stuff?

3411
02:28:07.708 --> 02:28:09.568
MARISHA: We got permission from the Cobalt Soul

3412
02:28:09.568 --> 02:28:12.484
to investigate the Chained Oblivion.

3413
02:28:12.484 --> 02:28:14.510
SAM: Chained Oblivion, of course, yes.

3414
02:28:14.510 --> 02:28:19.510
LIAM: We have done a great good for the city.
ASHLEY: What are you guys, what?

3415
02:28:19.553 --> 02:28:21.734
SAM: Oh, yeah.

3416
02:28:21.734 --> 02:28:24.840
LAURA: Oh shit, you don't even know.

3417
02:28:24.840 --> 02:28:27.298
ASHLEY: You kept referring to this--

3418
02:28:28.632 --> 02:28:30.140
What are you talking about?

3419
02:28:30.140 --> 02:28:32.594
MARISHA: When did you leave?

3420
02:28:32.594 --> 02:28:36.285
I'm a part of like a

3421
02:28:36.285 --> 02:28:38.854
huge establishment

3422
02:28:38.854 --> 02:28:41.689
arcing across the entire globe, a network of,

3423
02:28:41.689 --> 02:28:44.140
a monastery called the Cobalt Soul.

3424
02:28:44.140 --> 02:28:46.448
I don't know if I've ever told you that.

3425
02:28:46.448 --> 02:28:49.426
You might've just thought I was still like a shit-kicker--

3426
02:28:49.426 --> 02:28:51.241
ASHLEY: No, I--
MARISHA: -- when you left.

3427
02:28:51.241 --> 02:28:54.330
ASHLEY: I am familiar with the Cobalt Soul.

3428
02:28:54.330 --> 02:28:56.533
LAURA: Also, you weren't actually following this thing

3429
02:28:56.533 --> 02:28:57.724
called the Angel of Irons,

3430
02:28:57.724 --> 02:29:00.216
you were following the Chained Oblivion.

3431
02:29:01.356 --> 02:29:02.990
SAM: Were you aware of anything, or were you

3432
02:29:02.990 --> 02:29:06.535
just sort of a mindless robot?

3433
02:29:06.535 --> 02:29:09.393
ASHLEY: I was fully aware of everything.

3434
02:29:09.393 --> 02:29:12.254
I just had no control over what I was doing

3435
02:29:12.254 --> 02:29:15.485
and the choices that, I couldn't make any,

3436
02:29:15.485 --> 02:29:17.547
I couldn't make any choices.

3437
02:29:17.547 --> 02:29:21.387
LAURA: I knew that you didn't want to be evil, Yasha.

3438
02:29:21.387 --> 02:29:23.513
ASHLEY: Thank you, Jester.

3439
02:29:23.513 --> 02:29:25.966
SAM: I was on the fence.

3440
02:29:25.966 --> 02:29:28.374
ASHLEY: Fair.
MARISHA: So, question.

3441
02:29:29.430 --> 02:29:34.422
Because you don't remember much past when you woke up,

3442
02:29:35.651 --> 02:29:38.734
and you were called the Orphan Maker.

3443
02:29:39.817 --> 02:29:44.003
Has all of this happened to you before?

3444
02:29:44.003 --> 02:29:45.836
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3445
02:29:49.790 --> 02:29:54.707
All of the time that I lost in between,

3446
02:29:56.021 --> 02:29:58.854
or after I left the tribe, I guess

3447
02:30:01.140 --> 02:30:05.248
Obann had found me before, and

3448
02:30:06.273 --> 02:30:09.364
we traveled together

3449
02:30:09.364 --> 02:30:11.027
and did very bad things.

3450
02:30:11.027 --> 02:30:11.860
But

3451
02:30:14.960 --> 02:30:18.548
I didn't remember until he found me again,

3452
02:30:18.548 --> 02:30:21.463
and a lot of things are still coming back to me now.

3453
02:30:21.463 --> 02:30:24.130
LAURA: How did you break free before?

3454
02:30:26.344 --> 02:30:27.677
ASHLEY: Well, I was...

3455
02:30:32.020 --> 02:30:36.278
I somehow came upon a shrine of the Stormlord.

3456
02:30:39.494 --> 02:30:41.769
And I sort of--

3457
02:30:42.860 --> 02:30:47.602
I woke up, still feeling out of sorts,

3458
02:30:47.602 --> 02:30:51.501
but I felt a little bit more me.

3459
02:30:54.925 --> 02:30:59.756
SAM: Wasn't Obann only interested in individuals

3460
02:30:59.756 --> 02:31:03.449
who had a prolonged existence?

3461
02:31:03.449 --> 02:31:05.615
A resistance to death?

3462
02:31:07.757 --> 02:31:09.775
And are you immortal?

3463
02:31:09.775 --> 02:31:13.849
ASHLEY: No, I'm not immortal, but it's what he would call

3464
02:31:13.849 --> 02:31:18.098
his unstoppable family, so--

3465
02:31:18.098 --> 02:31:20.153
SAM: Why were you unstoppable?

3466
02:31:20.153 --> 02:31:25.145
ASHLEY: Well, I think we can

3467
02:31:25.145 --> 02:31:27.428
die and come back

3468
02:31:27.428 --> 02:31:31.549
a little bit easier than other people.

3469
02:31:31.549 --> 02:31:35.569
SAM: That was just innate in you, or he gave that to you?

3470
02:31:36.611 --> 02:31:41.481
ASHLEY: I think it's something that I maybe already had.

3471
02:31:41.481 --> 02:31:43.523
LAURA: Wow.

3472
02:31:43.523 --> 02:31:45.273
SAM: Where'd you get it?

3473
02:31:46.411 --> 02:31:48.803
ASHLEY: I don't know.

3474
02:31:49.722 --> 02:31:52.149
LAURA: Yasha's a superhero.

3475
02:31:52.149 --> 02:31:52.982
(gasps)

3476
02:31:52.982 --> 02:31:56.584
Yasha's a superhero, just like-- oh my gosh.

3477
02:31:56.584 --> 02:32:00.140
ASHLEY: No, I can die, of course, and if I died

3478
02:32:00.140 --> 02:32:02.816
and somebody left me there and didn't do anything,

3479
02:32:02.816 --> 02:32:05.222
I don't think I would just like come back to life.

3480
02:32:05.222 --> 02:32:10.028
I think it's just very easy to bring me back, I guess.

3481
02:32:10.028 --> 02:32:12.861
LAURA: Yasha, have you ever had a halo?

3482
02:32:13.822 --> 02:32:15.109
ASHLEY: What's a halo?

3483
02:32:15.109 --> 02:32:16.463
LAURA: It's like a circle around your head

3484
02:32:16.463 --> 02:32:18.132
that glows all the time.

3485
02:32:18.132 --> 02:32:20.916
MARISHA: Yeah, this girl we
traveled with, Reani, she had one.

3486
02:32:20.916 --> 02:32:23.393
LARUA: Because she was a superhero.
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Yeah.

3487
02:32:23.393 --> 02:32:27.410
ASHLEY: I've never had anything above my head but my hair,

3488
02:32:27.410 --> 02:32:32.410
and, you know, if things are flying around.

3489
02:32:32.693 --> 02:32:34.443
SAM: Maybe a hat?

3490
02:32:34.443 --> 02:32:35.849
LAURA: I don't feel a halo.

3491
02:32:35.849 --> 02:32:40.849
MARISHA: You have like, wings, ish, yeah?

3492
02:32:41.968 --> 02:32:45.093
ASHLEY: Yeah, but I mean, that's something that

3493
02:32:45.093 --> 02:32:47.616
comes out at weird times, it's not really--

3494
02:32:47.616 --> 02:32:51.132
TRAVIS: To catch you up, we've
been chasing this Angel of Irons,

3495
02:32:51.132 --> 02:32:56.058
which is a terrible entity called Tharizdun,

3496
02:32:56.058 --> 02:32:58.720
the Chained Oblivion.

3497
02:32:58.720 --> 02:33:03.496
SAM: And we've been chasing that entity

3498
02:33:03.496 --> 02:33:07.413
because of your mission for the Cobalt Soul, right?

3499
02:33:07.413 --> 02:33:09.841
MARISHA: Absolutely, got approval from day one.

3500
02:33:09.841 --> 02:33:11.107
SAM: Yep, yep, okay.

3501
02:33:11.107 --> 02:33:12.608
Sanctioned mission.
MARISHA: Yep.

3502
02:33:12.608 --> 02:33:14.734
TRAVIS: That is the story.

3503
02:33:14.734 --> 02:33:16.477
MARISHA: All for the Empire.
LAURA: Yep.

3504
02:33:16.477 --> 02:33:17.644
ASHLEY: I believe...

3505
02:33:21.752 --> 02:33:25.902
We met some members of the Cobalt Soul.

3506
02:33:27.182 --> 02:33:30.830
SAM: Ooh, yeah.
LAURA: Yeah, you did, Yasha.

3507
02:33:30.830 --> 02:33:31.663
ASHLEY: Yeah.

3508
02:33:33.511 --> 02:33:37.740
MARISHA: That was when I felt like I knew you were either

3509
02:33:37.740 --> 02:33:40.573
definitely evil or definitely--

3510
02:33:42.423 --> 02:33:43.823
yeah.

3511
02:33:44.804 --> 02:33:48.083
LAURA: You knew it was either one of those things.

3512
02:33:48.083 --> 02:33:49.328
SAM: It's a binary choice.

3513
02:33:49.328 --> 02:33:50.862
LAURA: Yes, yeah, it was definitely not--

3514
02:33:50.862 --> 02:33:53.753
MARISHA: Evil or not yourself,

3515
02:33:53.753 --> 02:33:54.589
I guess.
TRAVIS: Yasha, did you

3516
02:33:54.589 --> 02:33:57.714
leave this plane of existence at any time?

3517
02:33:57.714 --> 02:33:59.271
I know that's a strange question,

3518
02:33:59.271 --> 02:34:03.788
but did you travel anywhere that wasn't here?

3519
02:34:03.788 --> 02:34:05.603
ASHLEY: Yes.

3520
02:34:05.603 --> 02:34:08.770
TRAVIS: Do you remember what for?
SAM: Or where?

3521
02:34:10.700 --> 02:34:12.950
MATT: It was mainly for travel.

3522
02:34:17.620 --> 02:34:20.256
SAM: Whatcha reading?
TRAVIS: Hand me that page you're--

3523
02:34:20.256 --> 02:34:22.547
(laughter)

3524
02:34:22.547 --> 02:34:24.907
ASHLEY: We just traveled a lot.

3525
02:34:24.907 --> 02:34:27.719
I think we were.

3526
02:34:27.719 --> 02:34:30.698
SAM: One thing, just, we should focus on

3527
02:34:30.698 --> 02:34:34.774
what we're going to say in there, of course, but real quick.

3528
02:34:34.774 --> 02:34:37.817
This thing about you being a little bit more likely

3529
02:34:37.817 --> 02:34:41.000
to become alive again after you're dead,

3530
02:34:43.951 --> 02:34:46.951
did something draw you to Mollymauk?

3531
02:34:48.340 --> 02:34:50.848
How did you meet him?

3532
02:34:50.848 --> 02:34:54.637
Because didn't he say that the same thing happened to him?

3533
02:34:54.637 --> 02:34:56.765
LIAM: He crawled his way out of a grave.

3534
02:34:56.765 --> 02:34:58.209
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: (loud inhale)

3535
02:35:00.392 --> 02:35:02.442
ASHLEY: I mean, I just--

3536
02:35:04.425 --> 02:35:08.858
I met him because, when I finally came to,

3537
02:35:10.879 --> 02:35:15.879
I came upon their circus, and I met them

3538
02:35:15.908 --> 02:35:17.864
and I met Mollymauk and the rest of them,

3539
02:35:17.864 --> 02:35:22.472
and it was just happenstance that I came across them,

3540
02:35:22.472 --> 02:35:24.772
and he became my friend.

3541
02:35:24.772 --> 02:35:29.638
SAM: Did anything particularly draw you to each other?

3542
02:35:29.638 --> 02:35:31.958
LAURA: Other than the fact that you're both wonderful?

3543
02:35:31.958 --> 02:35:33.704
SAM: Well yeah, of course.

3544
02:35:33.704 --> 02:35:38.570
ASHLEY: Well, I mean, I was drawn to him because

3545
02:35:38.570 --> 02:35:40.428
he was Mollymauk.

3546
02:35:41.520 --> 02:35:45.780
I don't think there was any reason we were brought together,

3547
02:35:45.780 --> 02:35:50.780
but I'm very glad he found me when he did.

3548
02:35:54.023 --> 02:35:55.994
MARISHA: Speaking of, check it out, I got this dope tattoo

3549
02:35:55.994 --> 02:35:57.415
that's very much like his.

3550
02:35:57.415 --> 02:35:59.169
Yeah, look at that.

3551
02:35:59.169 --> 02:36:00.734
Yeah.

3552
02:36:00.734 --> 02:36:03.173
It's healed now.
TRAVIS: It's a habit.

3553
02:36:03.173 --> 02:36:05.970
ASHLEY: I do have a question.

3554
02:36:05.970 --> 02:36:08.035
SAM: Yeah, go ahead.

3555
02:36:08.035 --> 02:36:10.558
ASHLEY: Why are you speaking differently?

3556
02:36:10.558 --> 02:36:12.805
TALIESIN: (laughs)

3557
02:36:12.805 --> 02:36:13.652
TRAVIS: Right.

3558
02:36:13.652 --> 02:36:17.362
SAM: He got kicked by a donkey in Zadash.

3559
02:36:17.362 --> 02:36:19.517
Messed up his whole head.

3560
02:36:19.517 --> 02:36:22.252
Forgot who he was, couldn't walk for days.

3561
02:36:22.252 --> 02:36:25.032
Peed his pants, it was a mess.

3562
02:36:25.032 --> 02:36:29.216
He's just starting to walk and talk again now.

3563
02:36:29.216 --> 02:36:30.625
ASHLEY: That can't be true.

3564
02:36:30.625 --> 02:36:33.227
I don't feel like if you were kicked in the head by a donkey

3565
02:36:33.227 --> 02:36:34.884
you would start talking differently.

3566
02:36:34.884 --> 02:36:36.977
SAM: Bent over to tie his shoe, got kicked in the head

3567
02:36:36.977 --> 02:36:38.961
by a donkey, totally different guy.

3568
02:36:38.961 --> 02:36:41.525
TRAVIS: I think I know a guy in Texas that happened to.

3569
02:36:41.525 --> 02:36:43.457
(laughter)

3570
02:36:43.457 --> 02:36:46.209
TALIESIN: Is he British now, out of curiosity?

3571
02:36:46.209 --> 02:36:47.906
TRAVIS: He got kicked up.

3572
02:36:47.906 --> 02:36:49.575
LIAM: That man's name is Hugh Grant.

3573
02:36:49.575 --> 02:36:51.916
(laughter)

3574
02:36:51.916 --> 02:36:54.613
TRAVIS: You're not imagining things.

3575
02:36:54.613 --> 02:36:58.038
I had pretended to sort of emulate

3576
02:36:58.904 --> 02:37:01.484
someone I looked up to very much,

3577
02:37:01.484 --> 02:37:05.576
and I found, while you were away,

3578
02:37:05.576 --> 02:37:09.520
that there was no point in trying to be someone else.

3579
02:37:09.520 --> 02:37:12.123
I should just try and live this life as me,

3580
02:37:12.123 --> 02:37:14.889
and while this

3581
02:37:14.889 --> 02:37:18.173
voice had not served me very well previously,

3582
02:37:18.173 --> 02:37:22.631
I've decided to give it a go, because fuck it.

3583
02:37:24.558 --> 02:37:25.391
ASHLEY: Hmm.

3584
02:37:26.353 --> 02:37:29.364
Well, this is actually not the way that I talk.

3585
02:37:29.364 --> 02:37:31.119
SAM: What?
(Laura gasps)

3586
02:37:31.119 --> 02:37:32.441
ASHLEY: I was just kidding.

3587
02:37:32.441 --> 02:37:35.721
(laughter)

3588
02:37:35.721 --> 02:37:37.513
LIAM: Hey DM, question.

3589
02:37:37.513 --> 02:37:41.827
Are the two guards like ping-pong listening to all of this?

3590
02:37:41.827 --> 02:37:43.443
MATT: You guys are far enough away where they--

3591
02:37:43.443 --> 02:37:44.776
unless they have some super hearing--

3592
02:37:44.776 --> 02:37:46.800
they can't hear you.
LIAM: How far away are they?

3593
02:37:46.800 --> 02:37:49.380
MATT: They're probably close to 30 feet from you guys.

3594
02:37:49.380 --> 02:37:50.719
I imagine you guys are having this conversation

3595
02:37:50.719 --> 02:37:53.472
close to near the windows.

3596
02:37:53.472 --> 02:37:55.688
But they're less hearing and more just watching

3597
02:37:55.688 --> 02:37:57.204
to make sure you don't do anything funny.

3598
02:37:57.204 --> 02:37:59.014
LIAM: Caleb is listening to all the shenanigans around him

3599
02:37:59.014 --> 02:38:03.343
and is bathed in a total cold sweat.

3600
02:38:03.343 --> 02:38:04.176
MATT: Okay.

3601
02:38:05.027 --> 02:38:06.827
SAM: But turning attention towards

3602
02:38:06.827 --> 02:38:09.902
what might happen in there,

3603
02:38:09.902 --> 02:38:12.568
no mention of visits across the old--

3604
02:38:12.568 --> 02:38:14.265
LAURA: Mm-mm.

3605
02:38:14.265 --> 02:38:15.328
SAM: Range?

3606
02:38:15.328 --> 02:38:19.906
MARISHA: I would also assume that these walls have ears.

3607
02:38:19.906 --> 02:38:20.739
TALIESIN: What?

3608
02:38:22.214 --> 02:38:24.530
TRAVIS: They might be monitoring.

3609
02:38:24.530 --> 02:38:26.341
TALIESIN: Oh, okay.

3610
02:38:26.341 --> 02:38:27.349
LAURA: So don't fart.

3611
02:38:27.349 --> 02:38:29.249
TRAVIS: For untrustworthy folks, not us.
LAURA: Because people don't like it

3612
02:38:29.249 --> 02:38:30.659
when you fart in their castle.

3613
02:38:30.659 --> 02:38:32.568
TALIESIN: Really?
LAURA: I've heard.

3614
02:38:32.568 --> 02:38:35.318
ASHLEY: Why are you so stressed, Caleb?

3615
02:38:36.265 --> 02:38:37.702
LAURA: Oh Yasha.

3616
02:38:37.702 --> 02:38:40.467
TRAVIS: (laughs)

3617
02:38:40.467 --> 02:38:43.222
LAURA: He's just really got to fart.

3618
02:38:43.222 --> 02:38:45.782
And he's holding it in, I can see it on his face.

3619
02:38:45.782 --> 02:38:47.173
He's sweating because of it.

3620
02:38:47.173 --> 02:38:48.804
TRAVIS: There's so much for us to catch up on.

3621
02:38:48.804 --> 02:38:50.421
LAURA: Well, I am certainly not one to judge,

3622
02:38:50.421 --> 02:38:53.620
so if you need to fart, you can fart.

3623
02:38:53.620 --> 02:38:56.959
TRAVIS: Perhaps you should do us
all a favor and fart, Caleb.

3624
02:38:56.959 --> 02:38:58.249
LAURA: Don't do it, don't do it in the castle,

3625
02:38:58.249 --> 02:38:59.257
they really don't like it.

3626
02:38:59.257 --> 02:39:02.210
TRAVIS: -- fart lose. You'll never forgive yourself.
ASHLEY: Yeah, you should never trust a fart.

3627
02:39:02.210 --> 02:39:03.360
LIAM: There's nothing there.

3628
02:39:03.360 --> 02:39:04.699
LAURA: (laughs)

3629
02:39:04.699 --> 02:39:06.175
TRAVIS: Can I keep an eye on the back of his pants

3630
02:39:06.175 --> 02:39:08.483
for a little Plinko machine action?

3631
02:39:08.483 --> 02:39:10.206
MARISHA: Oh!

3632
02:39:10.206 --> 02:39:11.930
LIAM: Don't look at my Pu-muscles.

3633
02:39:11.930 --> 02:39:14.597
(laughter)

3634
02:39:19.228 --> 02:39:22.614
SAM: But we have your authority from the Cobalt Soul,

3635
02:39:22.614 --> 02:39:26.348
we have a symbol that we were given.

3636
02:39:26.348 --> 02:39:28.910
LIAM: We have done a great service
to the city, so hopefully--

3637
02:39:28.910 --> 02:39:33.459
TRAVIS: And remember, we were trying to keep an eye

3638
02:39:33.459 --> 02:39:37.841
on enemy incursions from the Dynasty into the Empire.

3639
02:39:37.841 --> 02:39:42.733
SAM: Do you think any personnel need be mentioned

3640
02:39:42.733 --> 02:39:44.773
in this discussion?

3641
02:39:44.773 --> 02:39:46.070
MARISHA: How do you mean, which personnel?

3642
02:39:46.070 --> 02:39:49.249
SAM: Well, their personnel?

3643
02:39:49.249 --> 02:39:52.493
We are sort of suspicious of some of them.

3644
02:39:52.493 --> 02:39:54.642
We have names of people who--

3645
02:39:54.642 --> 02:39:56.432
TRAVIS: I don't think so.

3646
02:39:56.432 --> 02:39:59.607
We're kind of in, you know, the heart of this thing.

3647
02:39:59.607 --> 02:40:02.007
TALIESIN: Is it also just possible that we did a good thing,

3648
02:40:02.007 --> 02:40:04.660
and good things are now going to happen?

3649
02:40:04.660 --> 02:40:06.038
TRAVIS: Certainly.
MARISHA: No.

3650
02:40:06.038 --> 02:40:06.871
LAURA: Yeah.

3651
02:40:06.871 --> 02:40:08.106
MARISHA: Good things don't just happen, Caduceus.
TALIESIN: I mean, I'm not saying

3652
02:40:08.106 --> 02:40:09.481
I'm right all the time,

3653
02:40:09.481 --> 02:40:10.644
but I've been right before.

3654
02:40:10.644 --> 02:40:13.540
TRAVIS: There is, if I'm correct, I remember hearing

3655
02:40:13.540 --> 02:40:15.625
about certain abilities that would cause you

3656
02:40:15.625 --> 02:40:17.525
to speak only the truth, right?

3657
02:40:17.525 --> 02:40:21.478
So let's be sure that if you are unsure of your truth,

3658
02:40:21.478 --> 02:40:24.233
maybe don't say anything.

3659
02:40:24.233 --> 02:40:26.668
MARISHA: Let's just stick to the facts.

3660
02:40:26.668 --> 02:40:28.230
We're not guilty of anything.

3661
02:40:28.230 --> 02:40:29.898
LAURA: That's right.
MARISHA: So don't act like it.

3662
02:40:29.898 --> 02:40:30.999
SAM: I mean.

3663
02:40:30.999 --> 02:40:32.693
TALIESIN: I'm not ashamed of anything I've done.
LAURA: Nott.

3664
02:40:32.693 --> 02:40:34.193
Just don't talk.

3665
02:40:34.193 --> 02:40:37.490
SAM: I'll take a big swig.
LAURA: Oh no.

3666
02:40:37.490 --> 02:40:39.548
LIAM: This is the second time we have done this,

3667
02:40:39.548 --> 02:40:42.131
only now we have no trump card.

3668
02:40:43.146 --> 02:40:46.979
MARISHA: Well, we have our, some are from the Empire.

3669
02:40:48.789 --> 02:40:51.111
SAM: One note.

3670
02:40:51.111 --> 02:40:55.740
Yasha, you've met some of these folks before

3671
02:40:55.740 --> 02:40:58.397
that we might encounter in there,

3672
02:40:58.397 --> 02:41:00.498
and one of them took a liking to you, right?

3673
02:41:00.498 --> 02:41:01.331
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

3674
02:41:03.023 --> 02:41:05.608
TRAVIS: Oh, are we going to see them?

3675
02:41:05.608 --> 02:41:06.858
SAM: I don't know.

3676
02:41:07.882 --> 02:41:09.125
MARISHA: Oh, Trent?

3677
02:41:09.125 --> 02:41:10.162
Ooh.

3678
02:41:10.162 --> 02:41:11.506
SAM: I mean--

3679
02:41:11.506 --> 02:41:14.753
LAURA: Why do you think Caleb looks like he's going to fart?

3680
02:41:14.753 --> 02:41:16.366
MARISHA: Huh?

3681
02:41:16.366 --> 02:41:17.399
LIAM: Nothing.
ASHLEY: Trent?

3682
02:41:17.399 --> 02:41:18.817
MATT: (door creaking)

3683
02:41:18.817 --> 02:41:20.516
TRAVIS: Oh fuck.
MATT: The door opens--

3684
02:41:20.516 --> 02:41:21.665
SAM: Did we get a short rest in?

3685
02:41:21.665 --> 02:41:22.801
MATT: You didn't quite get a short rest.

3686
02:41:22.801 --> 02:41:24.366
(groaning)

3687
02:41:24.366 --> 02:41:25.838
TRAVIS: (laughs)

3688
02:41:25.838 --> 02:41:26.841
Woo!

3689
02:41:26.841 --> 02:41:28.838
LIAM: Eight hit points.

3690
02:41:28.838 --> 02:41:32.518
MATT: The door opens and the marshal arrives once more.

3691
02:41:32.518 --> 02:41:35.147
"You are to leave your weapons within the chamber.

3692
02:41:35.147 --> 02:41:36.095
"Follow me."

3693
02:41:36.095 --> 02:41:38.541
TRAVIS: Not a problem.
LAURA: Do you have any spells?

3694
02:41:38.541 --> 02:41:39.636
You should heal Caleb.

3695
02:41:39.636 --> 02:41:41.585
He's got no hit points.
MATT: One of the guards comes in,

3696
02:41:41.585 --> 02:41:42.418
and somebody from behind

3697
02:41:42.418 --> 02:41:45.318
comes with a small table and sets it up outside of the door,

3698
02:41:45.318 --> 02:41:48.960
and as you approach, the marshal
gestures towards the table to leave your

3699
02:41:48.960 --> 02:41:51.441
weapons within.
LAURA: That's my name.

3700
02:41:51.441 --> 02:41:54.860
TRAVIS: I will put the whip and whatever other thing,

3701
02:41:54.860 --> 02:41:56.809
but there is no sword to be seen.

3702
02:41:56.809 --> 02:41:58.935
MATT: Yeah, that's true. All right.

3703
02:41:58.935 --> 02:42:02.076
SAM: I'll put my crossbow,

3704
02:42:03.518 --> 02:42:05.334
and see if I can just sort of

3705
02:42:05.334 --> 02:42:07.026
keep the gun tucked away.

3706
02:42:07.026 --> 02:42:08.135
MATT: Roll a sleight of hand check.

3707
02:42:08.135 --> 02:42:09.009
TRAVIS: Oh boy.

3708
02:42:09.009 --> 02:42:11.485
MATT: You have a gun and a dagger on you.

3709
02:42:11.485 --> 02:42:14.210
SAM: A gun and a dagger, you're right.

3710
02:42:14.210 --> 02:42:15.879
That is sleight of hand?

3711
02:42:15.879 --> 02:42:17.554
MATT: Yes.
SAM: 29.

3712
02:42:18.395 --> 02:42:20.279
MATT: You feel pretty confident that you hid both

3713
02:42:20.279 --> 02:42:22.525
the dagger and the gun without issue.

3714
02:42:22.525 --> 02:42:24.900
TALIESIN: What good it will do you, beyond me.

3715
02:42:24.900 --> 02:42:27.414
MARISHA: I bring my fists, because
they're always with me, bitches!

3716
02:42:27.414 --> 02:42:29.110
TALIESIN: You have to register them,
though, before you can--

3717
02:42:29.110 --> 02:42:30.476
MATT: You do, you do.

3718
02:42:30.476 --> 02:42:31.452
Do you leave your staff?

3719
02:42:31.452 --> 02:42:32.573
MARISHA: Huh?
MATT: Leave your staff?

3720
02:42:32.573 --> 02:42:33.530
MARISHA: Yeah, I leave my staff.
MATT: Okay.

3721
02:42:33.530 --> 02:42:35.438
TRAVIS: Do they have names?

3722
02:42:35.438 --> 02:42:36.843
MARISHA: I'll get back to you on that.

3723
02:42:36.843 --> 02:42:37.820
TALIESIN: I'll leave my shield.

3724
02:42:37.820 --> 02:42:39.474
Are they going to make noise about my staff?

3725
02:42:39.474 --> 02:42:40.593
MATT: Yes.

3726
02:42:40.593 --> 02:42:43.533
TALIESIN: Can I keep my crystal or no?

3727
02:42:43.533 --> 02:42:44.854
MATT: No.
TALIESIN: All right.

3728
02:42:44.854 --> 02:42:46.460
I don't-- all right.

3729
02:42:46.460 --> 02:42:49.041
LAURA: I'm going to place my handaxe down.

3730
02:42:49.041 --> 02:42:51.214
Should I leave my shield?

3731
02:42:51.214 --> 02:42:54.856
I leave my awesome new shield.

3732
02:42:59.949 --> 02:43:01.753
MATT: Do you have your-- oh, you have the rod,

3733
02:43:01.753 --> 02:43:05.643
that doesn't look like a weapon, necessarily.

3734
02:43:05.643 --> 02:43:06.889
LAURA: I can leave it.

3735
02:43:06.889 --> 02:43:08.837
I've got a couple wands on me.

3736
02:43:08.837 --> 02:43:10.179
MARISHA: It looks like a princess scepter.

3737
02:43:10.179 --> 02:43:12.028
MATT: I'd say, unless you're going to try and hide them,

3738
02:43:12.028 --> 02:43:13.415
they're going to want you to place anything

3739
02:43:13.415 --> 02:43:16.088
that could possibly be a weapon.
LAURA: All right, I'll put my one rod,

3740
02:43:16.088 --> 02:43:18.964
and I'll put my Wand of Smiles as well down.

3741
02:43:18.964 --> 02:43:19.797
MATT: Okay.

3742
02:43:21.759 --> 02:43:23.426
You have two swords.

3743
02:43:24.541 --> 02:43:27.874
ASHLEY: I mean, I'm not going to hurt anybody.

3744
02:43:29.498 --> 02:43:30.331
MATT: "Please."

3745
02:43:31.523 --> 02:43:32.629
TALIESIN: Set it there.

3746
02:43:32.629 --> 02:43:33.911
LIAM: Shunk!

3747
02:43:33.911 --> 02:43:36.061
ASHLEY: I put the Skingorger down.

3748
02:43:38.130 --> 02:43:38.963
MATT: "And?"

3749
02:43:40.655 --> 02:43:43.419
SAM: That's more of like a walking stick.

3750
02:43:43.419 --> 02:43:44.828
ASHLEY: Magician's Judge.
MATT: Okay.

3751
02:43:44.828 --> 02:43:46.236
LAURA: I'm also going to put my

3752
02:43:46.236 --> 02:43:48.970
old metal orc mask on the table.

3753
02:43:48.970 --> 02:43:50.242
MATT: (laughs)

3754
02:43:50.242 --> 02:43:51.486
LIAM: Just put it on.

3755
02:43:51.486 --> 02:43:52.936
I'm ready.

3756
02:43:56.430 --> 02:43:58.977
LAURA: And some hair oil.

3757
02:43:58.977 --> 02:44:02.276
ASHLEY: Oh, I forgot about that hair oil.

3758
02:44:02.276 --> 02:44:05.312
MARISHA: And a business card for the hair oil.

3759
02:44:05.312 --> 02:44:07.038
(laughter)

3760
02:44:07.038 --> 02:44:08.932
TALIESIN: Slide it. Don't break eye contact.

3761
02:44:08.932 --> 02:44:12.725
LAURA: Should I leave my weasel on the table, or just,

3762
02:44:12.725 --> 02:44:14.839
can I take the weasel with me?

3763
02:44:14.839 --> 02:44:16.047
He's just--
TRAVIS: (as Sprinkle) Help!

3764
02:44:16.047 --> 02:44:17.511
(laughter)

3765
02:44:17.511 --> 02:44:19.166
TALIESIN: The weasel looks up, "Call the guards!"

3766
02:44:19.166 --> 02:44:20.903
MATT: Which would you prefer?

3767
02:44:20.903 --> 02:44:22.026
LAURA: I'll take him with me.

3768
02:44:22.026 --> 02:44:23.590
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

3769
02:44:23.590 --> 02:44:26.690
SAM: (as Sprinkle) Call the ASPCA, please!

3770
02:44:26.690 --> 02:44:28.067
MATT: (as Sprinkle) Call the police!

3771
02:44:28.067 --> 02:44:29.785
LIAM: I would like to immigrate to the Empire.

3772
02:44:29.785 --> 02:44:31.732
(laughter)

3773
02:44:31.732 --> 02:44:34.340
LAURA: Persuasion, persuasion.

3774
02:44:34.340 --> 02:44:37.240
Is that a 14 or a 19?

3775
02:44:38.272 --> 02:44:40.253
TALIESIN: What?
LAURA: Is that a 14 or a 19?

3776
02:44:40.253 --> 02:44:41.594
TALIESIN: I can't see because your finger's in the way.

3777
02:44:41.594 --> 02:44:42.538
That's a 14.

3778
02:44:42.538 --> 02:44:46.075
LAURA: Okay, so that is a 19.

3779
02:44:46.075 --> 02:44:47.878
MATT: "You can keep the weasel."

3780
02:44:47.878 --> 02:44:49.057
LAURA: Thank you.
TRAVIS: (as Sprinkle) No!

3781
02:44:49.057 --> 02:44:51.724
(laughter)

3782
02:44:53.670 --> 02:44:55.874
SAM: It's trying to slip a note to the guard.

3783
02:44:55.874 --> 02:44:59.228
(laughter)

3784
02:44:59.228 --> 02:45:00.790
TALIESIN: My name is Toby!

3785
02:45:00.790 --> 02:45:03.292
LIAM: Desperately doing Thieves' Cant.
TALIESIN: Call my parents!

3786
02:45:03.292 --> 02:45:06.715
(laughter)

3787
02:45:06.715 --> 02:45:09.936
MATT: All right.
LAURA: Poor Sprinkle.

3788
02:45:09.936 --> 02:45:12.085
I love-- I'm petting Sprinkle.

3789
02:45:12.085 --> 02:45:15.460
(laughter)

3790
02:45:15.460 --> 02:45:18.519
MATT: With all the noticed weapons placed upon the table

3791
02:45:18.519 --> 02:45:20.158
and surrendered.

3792
02:45:20.158 --> 02:45:23.739
SAM: It's blinking S.O.S.

3793
02:45:23.739 --> 02:45:27.199
MATT: The marshal leads you out of the chamber.

3794
02:45:27.199 --> 02:45:29.608
You are then led down a rapid flurry of turns,

3795
02:45:29.608 --> 02:45:31.668
each arched hallway bending from the last

3796
02:45:31.668 --> 02:45:34.936
until you come upon a large set of double doors

3797
02:45:34.936 --> 02:45:38.799
carved from a deep red wood, each bearing the crest

3798
02:45:38.799 --> 02:45:41.657
of the Dwendalian Empire, the familiar owl and wheat

3799
02:45:41.657 --> 02:45:44.164
over the crown symbol.

3800
02:45:44.164 --> 02:45:46.069
I've shown you guys that, right?

3801
02:45:46.069 --> 02:45:47.551
The symbol?
MARISHA: The owl?

3802
02:45:47.551 --> 02:45:49.044
MATT: That's the symbol.
LAURA: Fucking owls.

3803
02:45:49.044 --> 02:45:50.526
LAURA: Whoa.
MARISHA: What the fuck.

3804
02:45:50.526 --> 02:45:51.567
LAURA: That's the symbol for the Empire?

3805
02:45:51.567 --> 02:45:52.691
MATT: Yeah.
LAURA: Cool.

3806
02:45:52.691 --> 02:45:54.421
TALIESIN: No, you have never shown it to us.

3807
02:45:54.421 --> 02:45:56.277
LAURA: That's the whole Empire?

3808
02:45:56.277 --> 02:45:58.211
MATT: That is the consistent--

3809
02:45:58.211 --> 02:46:00.205
LAURA: Can I see it, can I see it?
MATT: Sure.

3810
02:46:00.205 --> 02:46:02.508
TALIESIN: They give a hoot.
MARISHA: Piece of shit.

3811
02:46:02.508 --> 02:46:04.231
TRAVIS: Shame on you, Taliesin.

3812
02:46:04.231 --> 02:46:06.147
TALIESIN: I have so many unused owl puns,

3813
02:46:06.147 --> 02:46:07.254
I got to do something with them.

3814
02:46:07.254 --> 02:46:08.821
MATT: There you go.
MARISHA: (laughs)

3815
02:46:08.821 --> 02:46:11.113
LIAM: No, save them, save them for the future.

3816
02:46:11.113 --> 02:46:13.938
MATT: The marshal knocks on the door heavily.

3817
02:46:13.938 --> 02:46:18.921
The resonant boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,

3818
02:46:18.921 --> 02:46:22.046
echoing throughout the nearby walls.

3819
02:46:22.046 --> 02:46:25.047
A moment later, the doors open from within.

3820
02:46:25.047 --> 02:46:28.547
(imitating doors opening)

3821
02:46:30.662 --> 02:46:33.190
And you're brought into an enormous chamber,

3822
02:46:33.190 --> 02:46:35.941
the ceiling ramping up towards the back,

3823
02:46:35.941 --> 02:46:38.128
where the extremely tall back walls

3824
02:46:38.128 --> 02:46:40.410
bear numerous red banners that hang

3825
02:46:40.410 --> 02:46:44.315
nearly 40 to 50 feet from the apex.

3826
02:46:44.315 --> 02:46:46.691
Multiples of them.

3827
02:46:46.691 --> 02:46:49.763
Elite Crownsguard are stationed throughout the room,

3828
02:46:49.763 --> 02:46:51.823
while the back center of the chamber

3829
02:46:51.823 --> 02:46:55.705
climbs via stair to multiple small platforms,

3830
02:46:55.705 --> 02:46:58.838
almost forum-like, containing

3831
02:46:58.838 --> 02:47:00.911
empty high-backed chairs that face inward

3832
02:47:00.911 --> 02:47:03.732
towards the pinnacle of the rising stairs,

3833
02:47:03.732 --> 02:47:05.937
where a platform, wide on the top,

3834
02:47:05.937 --> 02:47:07.696
holds multiple figures gathered around

3835
02:47:07.696 --> 02:47:10.215
an incredibly tall throne.

3836
02:47:10.215 --> 02:47:12.251
It's at this point you gather that you're in

3837
02:47:12.251 --> 02:47:15.577
the throne chamber of King Bertrand Dwendal.

3838
02:47:17.311 --> 02:47:18.730
TRAVIS: Fuck me.

3839
02:47:18.730 --> 02:47:19.975
Okay.

3840
02:47:19.975 --> 02:47:23.577
MATT: You're ushered into the room and led to the stair,

3841
02:47:23.577 --> 02:47:25.993
climbing them one by one.

3842
02:47:27.927 --> 02:47:32.133
The footfalls echo throughout the spacious hall,

3843
02:47:32.133 --> 02:47:35.389
and your ears pick up the sound

3844
02:47:35.389 --> 02:47:37.110
of your heart beating faster.

3845
02:47:37.110 --> 02:47:39.838
(imitating heart beating)

3846
02:47:40.921 --> 02:47:42.716
You can hear the muffled sounds of conversation

3847
02:47:42.716 --> 02:47:44.216
coming from above.

3848
02:47:45.633 --> 02:47:47.766
You begin to reach the apex of the climb

3849
02:47:47.766 --> 02:47:50.936
and tip over the top, to arrive at the gathering

3850
02:47:50.936 --> 02:47:55.619
of eight figures, all of which are standing but one.

3851
02:47:56.504 --> 02:47:59.504
Sitting atop the large-backed throne itself

3852
02:47:59.504 --> 02:48:02.504
you see a man in his late 60s.

3853
02:48:02.504 --> 02:48:05.952
His past-shoulder-length, wavy dark gray hair

3854
02:48:05.952 --> 02:48:08.724
bunched over his brown and gold noble attire,

3855
02:48:08.724 --> 02:48:11.434
a long, thin beard that just crests down

3856
02:48:11.434 --> 02:48:15.073
from his chin is tied from beneath,

3857
02:48:15.073 --> 02:48:17.252
and a crown of gold upon his brow

3858
02:48:17.252 --> 02:48:19.510
to the same symbol as the one you see

3859
02:48:19.510 --> 02:48:22.035
on the bottom of the crest.

3860
02:48:22.035 --> 02:48:24.452
From artworks and depictions you've seen,

3861
02:48:24.452 --> 02:48:29.307
you now know this to be King Bertrand Dwendal.

3862
02:48:29.307 --> 02:48:32.144
Sitting to the king's right is an older male gnome

3863
02:48:32.144 --> 02:48:34.008
of darker skin, white receding hair,

3864
02:48:34.008 --> 02:48:37.296
and robes of matching colors to the king's attire.

3865
02:48:38.138 --> 02:48:41.055
You two make History checks for me.

3866
02:48:42.034 --> 02:48:43.894
MARISHA: Not this one, not that one.

3867
02:48:43.894 --> 02:48:45.839
LIAM: My hands are drenched.

3868
02:48:45.839 --> 02:48:47.520
History?
MATT: Yes.

3869
02:48:47.520 --> 02:48:48.805
LIAM: 18.
MARISHA: 19.

3870
02:48:48.805 --> 02:48:49.638
MATT: Great.

3871
02:48:49.638 --> 02:48:51.685
Both of you recognize this figure to likely be

3872
02:48:51.685 --> 02:48:56.113
Oliver Schreiber, who is the retainer to the crown.

3873
02:48:56.113 --> 02:48:59.339
The direct associate and assistant to the king.

3874
02:48:59.339 --> 02:49:00.687
SAM: Oliver who?
MATT: Schreiber.

3875
02:49:00.687 --> 02:49:02.332
LAURA: Shribe.
MATT: Schrieber.

3876
02:49:02.332 --> 02:49:03.526
LAURA: Schreiber.

3877
02:49:03.526 --> 02:49:05.175
MARISHA: Like the assistant to the crown,

3878
02:49:05.175 --> 02:49:06.745
like hand of the king type of thing?

3879
02:49:06.745 --> 02:49:08.896
MATT: Kind of, yeah, the retainer.

3880
02:49:08.896 --> 02:49:10.859
To the left of the king you see a man

3881
02:49:10.859 --> 02:49:13.641
of similar age to the king, though he stands tall and thin

3882
02:49:13.641 --> 02:49:15.722
from within his immaculately tailored garments

3883
02:49:15.722 --> 02:49:19.650
of silver silks, jeweled epaulets, and billowing sleeves.

3884
02:49:19.650 --> 02:49:22.892
His pale skin and very tightly trimmed hair

3885
02:49:22.892 --> 02:49:27.892
atop a clean-shaven, if intense and judging, long face.

3886
02:49:28.227 --> 02:49:30.795
You both know this likely to be

3887
02:49:30.795 --> 02:49:33.295
Prime Arbiter Sydnok Truscan.

3888
02:49:34.192 --> 02:49:35.725
SAM: Sydnok...

3889
02:49:36.609 --> 02:49:38.302
Truscan.

3890
02:49:38.302 --> 02:49:40.624
MATT: He is the leader of the noble Truscan family,

3891
02:49:40.624 --> 02:49:42.530
which oversee much of the Truscan Vale,

3892
02:49:42.530 --> 02:49:45.029
which is the far-west area where Deastok

3893
02:49:45.029 --> 02:49:48.311
and Kamordah currently are.

3894
02:49:48.311 --> 02:49:50.102
MARISHA: Yeah. All right.

3895
02:49:51.168 --> 02:49:54.014
MATT: Within the current council
that surrounds this platform,

3896
02:49:54.014 --> 02:49:56.964
you see an agender half-elf of middle age

3897
02:49:56.964 --> 02:49:59.246
wrapped in the most elaborate robes of the Cobalt Soul

3898
02:49:59.246 --> 02:50:01.452
you've had yet to encounter.

3899
02:50:01.452 --> 02:50:03.683
Their short red hair tangles like a flame

3900
02:50:03.683 --> 02:50:05.275
while their expression masks their true mood

3901
02:50:05.275 --> 02:50:07.145
with a neutral smile.

3902
02:50:07.145 --> 02:50:09.720
Beau, you recognize them immediately by reputation,

3903
02:50:09.720 --> 02:50:14.244
not by visual recognition, as the High Curator Yudala Fon,

3904
02:50:14.244 --> 02:50:16.994
Herald of the Rexxentrum Archive.

3905
02:50:18.072 --> 02:50:21.064
TRAVIS: Yudala Fon?
MATT: Yudala Fon.

3906
02:50:23.347 --> 02:50:26.227
The rest of the group that you're greeting here

3907
02:50:26.227 --> 02:50:28.185
are familiar to you all.

3908
02:50:28.185 --> 02:50:30.360
Arcanist Allura Vysoren--
LAURA: (gasps) Yay!

3909
02:50:30.360 --> 02:50:32.300
MATT: --looks at you with a nod.

3910
02:50:32.300 --> 02:50:34.905
Headmaster Oremid Hass halts his conversation

3911
02:50:34.905 --> 02:50:38.058
with Martinet Ludinus Da'leth as they both

3912
02:50:38.058 --> 02:50:40.808
look your way upon your approach.

3913
02:50:42.383 --> 02:50:44.783
Ludinus looking in your direction.

3914
02:50:48.018 --> 02:50:49.205
SAM: Ludinus.

3915
02:50:49.205 --> 02:50:52.697
TRAVIS: How are their expressions
when they look upon us, especially Allura?

3916
02:50:52.697 --> 02:50:56.173
Is it inviting, worrisome,
what do we see on their face?

3917
02:50:56.173 --> 02:50:57.230
LAURA: She nodded warmly.

3918
02:50:57.230 --> 02:51:00.531
MATT: She nodded, like, acknowledging your arrival.

3919
02:51:00.531 --> 02:51:04.677
There is a figure that--
okay, one of the eight figures

3920
02:51:04.677 --> 02:51:07.617
is a very very well-armored guard,
you do not see the face,

3921
02:51:07.617 --> 02:51:09.712
and they stay to the side and the back

3922
02:51:09.712 --> 02:51:10.778
of the throne of the king.

3923
02:51:10.778 --> 02:51:14.032
It looks like a personal protector, a guard who is

3924
02:51:14.032 --> 02:51:18.078
just at all times, full plate armor, a tall figure,

3925
02:51:18.078 --> 02:51:21.558
and with no expression, you just see the helmet itself

3926
02:51:21.558 --> 02:51:23.279
and dark shadow where the eyes would be,

3927
02:51:23.279 --> 02:51:25.357
and is just at any given point in time

3928
02:51:25.357 --> 02:51:28.257
ready to protect the king.

3929
02:51:28.257 --> 02:51:30.934
MARISHA: Is Yudala Fon Zadash or Rexxentrum?

3930
02:51:30.934 --> 02:51:33.627
MATT: Rexxentrum.
MARISHA: That's right, okay.

3931
02:51:33.627 --> 02:51:35.553
MATT: The last figure, to your immediate right,

3932
02:51:35.553 --> 02:51:40.332
is the old, jaundiced face of Master Trent Ikithon.

3933
02:51:40.332 --> 02:51:43.582
(Sam inhaling sharply)

3934
02:51:44.561 --> 02:51:46.429
As you approach, Allura speaks up.

3935
02:51:46.429 --> 02:51:51.429
"Ah, yes, these are the Mighty Nein
I spoke of, your grace.

3936
02:51:51.456 --> 02:51:54.175
"They are the ones who uncovered the plot

3937
02:51:54.175 --> 02:51:57.249
"by this hidden religious sect."

3938
02:51:57.249 --> 02:51:59.499
Oremid Hass then speaks up.

3939
02:51:59.499 --> 02:52:02.369
"Indeed, since our encounter,
I've looked into the threads

3940
02:52:02.369 --> 02:52:04.896
"that connect to this Angel of Irons,

3941
02:52:04.896 --> 02:52:07.052
"the disparate records of their doing

3942
02:52:07.052 --> 02:52:10.955
"and the machinations of the Chained Oblivion.

3943
02:52:10.955 --> 02:52:13.335
"The similarities are embarrassing

3944
02:52:13.335 --> 02:52:16.866
"to have not been caught sooner, my liege."

3945
02:52:16.866 --> 02:52:21.113
The king sits and leans forward on the throne.

3946
02:52:21.113 --> 02:52:23.268
"And you know this has not been done

3947
02:52:23.268 --> 02:52:26.027
"by the Dynasty hands, how?

3948
02:52:27.083 --> 02:52:30.064
"The timing of their attack on the capital

3949
02:52:30.064 --> 02:52:34.831
"and this apparent cult event
is convenient, is it not?"

3950
02:52:36.939 --> 02:52:39.664
TALIESIN: Um--
LAURA: (whispering)

3951
02:52:39.664 --> 02:52:40.744
MATT: They all turn and look towards you

3952
02:52:40.744 --> 02:52:43.305
as you clear your throat.

3953
02:52:43.305 --> 02:52:46.758
TALIESIN: It definitely struck us as well.

3954
02:52:46.758 --> 02:52:50.083
My personal theory, if there's interest,

3955
02:52:51.682 --> 02:52:52.607
this cult,

3956
02:52:52.607 --> 02:52:55.885
(clears throat) this cult, wow,

3957
02:52:55.885 --> 02:53:00.327
uses a lot of mind control and manipulation.

3958
02:53:02.494 --> 02:53:06.443
My theory as to why the quick retreat happened,

3959
02:53:06.443 --> 02:53:10.487
seemingly in an unexpected way, was the--

3960
02:53:10.487 --> 02:53:12.553
this is really nerve-wracking.

3961
02:53:12.553 --> 02:53:14.685
Was perhaps--
SAM: I've never heard you talk this loud.

3962
02:53:14.685 --> 02:53:17.921
TALIESIN: I've never heard me talk this loud.
SAM: (laughs)

3963
02:53:17.921 --> 02:53:20.153
Due to sudden realization that they didn't

3964
02:53:20.153 --> 02:53:22.352
entirely understand what their motivations were

3965
02:53:22.352 --> 02:53:24.604
in the first place.

3966
02:53:24.604 --> 02:53:27.260
They may have panicked when control

3967
02:53:27.260 --> 02:53:29.505
over a couple key members was released.

3968
02:53:29.505 --> 02:53:32.574
I have no proof of this other than--

3969
02:53:32.574 --> 02:53:33.432
SAM: The timing.

3970
02:53:33.432 --> 02:53:35.576
TALIESIN: Just a suspicion and the timing.

3971
02:53:35.576 --> 02:53:38.542
MATT: The king goes, "This--

3972
02:53:38.542 --> 02:53:42.749
"this just a hunch,
as you would say."

3973
02:53:42.749 --> 02:53:45.101
TALIESIN: An educated guess.

3974
02:53:45.101 --> 02:53:50.101
MATT: "You look perhaps not as educated
as one would assume?"

3975
02:53:51.471 --> 02:53:52.964
TALIESIN: Thank you!

3976
02:53:52.964 --> 02:53:55.739
MATT: Yudala speaks up and steps forward.

3977
02:53:56.959 --> 02:54:00.842
"It is odd timing, my liege,

3978
02:54:00.842 --> 02:54:02.641
"but our operatives

3979
02:54:02.641 --> 02:54:06.943
"have been closely monitoring
Kryn movements for some time,

3980
02:54:06.943 --> 02:54:10.223
"and there is little sign of a larger involvement

3981
02:54:10.223 --> 02:54:11.473
"with this cult.

3982
02:54:12.316 --> 02:54:16.511
"We've numerous expositors
who've infiltrated the enemy,

3983
02:54:16.511 --> 02:54:19.916
"and current estimation is that perhaps this cult

3984
02:54:19.916 --> 02:54:22.576
"instead orchestrated their attack

3985
02:54:22.576 --> 02:54:26.817
"in time with the Kryn assault,
not the other way around.

3986
02:54:26.817 --> 02:54:31.056
"One such expositor I speak of
was part of this troop.

3987
02:54:31.056 --> 02:54:33.684
"Expositor Beauregard, welcome.

3988
02:54:33.684 --> 02:54:36.030
"If you would speak to our king
on what you've discovered

3989
02:54:36.030 --> 02:54:38.773
"while you were in Xhorhas."

3990
02:54:38.773 --> 02:54:40.515
(scattered applause)

3991
02:54:40.515 --> 02:54:42.365
SAM: Woo!

3992
02:54:42.365 --> 02:54:43.873
MARISHA: You don't have to--

3993
02:54:47.661 --> 02:54:51.894
Yes, it seems there is a very significant...

3994
02:54:54.244 --> 02:54:58.494
evidence to suggest that this war

3995
02:54:58.494 --> 02:55:00.877
between the Dynasty and the Empire

3996
02:55:00.877 --> 02:55:03.410
exists no more than...

3997
02:55:04.727 --> 02:55:06.436
personal grudge

3998
02:55:06.436 --> 02:55:09.328
that has existed for hundreds of years.

3999
02:55:09.328 --> 02:55:12.411
You're right, this is nerve-wracking.

4000
02:55:14.928 --> 02:55:19.178
While some members of the Kryn Dynasty

4001
02:55:19.178 --> 02:55:22.445
might have also experienced mind control,

4002
02:55:22.445 --> 02:55:25.456
we did see evidence that there were portals

4003
02:55:25.456 --> 02:55:27.147
from the hells being opened up--

4004
02:55:27.147 --> 02:55:29.814
or from the Abyss, my apologies.

4005
02:55:33.064 --> 02:55:37.586
On the Dynasty side, just as equally
as we found evidence

4006
02:55:37.586 --> 02:55:41.399
that there were portals being
opened up on the Empire side,

4007
02:55:41.399 --> 02:55:43.690
which honestly,

4008
02:55:43.690 --> 02:55:47.773
to my educated guess,

4009
02:55:47.773 --> 02:55:51.706
leads me to believe that this was some sort of

4010
02:55:51.706 --> 02:55:55.988
potentially global infiltration
that was being planned.

4011
02:55:55.988 --> 02:55:59.879
Like punching holes between realities,

4012
02:55:59.879 --> 02:56:02.304
and with enough holes,

4013
02:56:02.304 --> 02:56:05.695
you get a thinner and thinner veil

4014
02:56:05.695 --> 02:56:07.553
that's more easily torn--
LAURA: Like termites.

4015
02:56:07.553 --> 02:56:09.588
MARISHA: Like termites, thank you.

4016
02:56:09.588 --> 02:56:10.924
MATT: (as Ludinus) "She speaks truth."

4017
02:56:10.924 --> 02:56:13.605
And everyone looks over, and you can see

4018
02:56:13.605 --> 02:56:17.858
Martinet Ludinus Da'leth, in his older elvish,

4019
02:56:17.858 --> 02:56:22.738
very graceful form, step forward,
his robe strafing behind.

4020
02:56:22.738 --> 02:56:24.875
"There have been a number of these portals

4021
02:56:24.875 --> 02:56:28.996
"discovered across the Empire
for some weeks now,

4022
02:56:28.996 --> 02:56:32.760
"each one seemingly housed by some sort of

4023
02:56:32.760 --> 02:56:34.343
"dimensional anchor.

4024
02:56:35.316 --> 02:56:38.806
"They have been gathered and destroyed.

4025
02:56:38.806 --> 02:56:43.072
"And from what we can gather,
these were possibly placed

4026
02:56:43.072 --> 02:56:47.472
"by either the Kryn or by this cult.

4027
02:56:47.472 --> 02:56:50.377
"Based on the information
that has been presented,

4028
02:56:50.377 --> 02:56:53.632
"while we at first thought
perhaps it was to scramble

4029
02:56:53.632 --> 02:56:57.783
"and confuse us, to enable
the ease of attack

4030
02:56:57.783 --> 02:57:01.266
"on our own soil, this...

4031
02:57:01.266 --> 02:57:02.807
"dimensional puncturing,

4032
02:57:02.807 --> 02:57:06.136
"as you perhaps put it, seems to lean closer

4033
02:57:06.136 --> 02:57:07.380
"in the direction of what this cult

4034
02:57:07.380 --> 02:57:09.264
"was attempting to achieve."

4035
02:57:09.264 --> 02:57:14.264
MARISHA: And with all due respect, Ludinus,

4036
02:57:16.190 --> 02:57:18.975
we have first-hand evidence that there were

4037
02:57:18.975 --> 02:57:21.016
other members...

4038
02:57:22.733 --> 02:57:25.508
from the Empire as well

4039
02:57:25.508 --> 02:57:28.264
who were responsible in placing these devices,

4040
02:57:28.264 --> 02:57:31.065
not just Kryn operatives.

4041
02:57:31.065 --> 02:57:32.688
MATT: This king at this point has been like

4042
02:57:32.688 --> 02:57:36.431
tugging and stroking, listening-- on his beard

4043
02:57:36.431 --> 02:57:38.464
down below his chin goes,

4044
02:57:38.464 --> 02:57:40.205
"Well then please, tell us."

4045
02:57:45.556 --> 02:57:48.097
MARISHA: We found this device...

4046
02:57:49.781 --> 02:57:52.858
one of the mechanisms

4047
02:57:52.858 --> 02:57:56.532
used to open these portals,
with a piece of this...

4048
02:57:58.216 --> 02:57:59.282
fabric

4049
02:58:01.187 --> 02:58:04.961
that we traced back, and with the help

4050
02:58:04.961 --> 02:58:09.075
of the incredible cleric Jester Lavore,

4051
02:58:09.075 --> 02:58:12.791
scryed and traced it back to an...

4052
02:58:14.333 --> 02:58:16.423
Empire operative.

4053
02:58:16.423 --> 02:58:19.540
TRAVIS: Is anyone shifting, is anyone blushing?

4054
02:58:19.540 --> 02:58:20.613
MATT: Make an Insight check.

4055
02:58:20.613 --> 02:58:23.559
TALIESIN: I was definitely going to
look for that as well.

4056
02:58:25.001 --> 02:58:26.962
LAURA: Specifically the martinet.

4057
02:58:26.962 --> 02:58:29.303
TALIESIN: 19.
TRAVIS: 19.

4058
02:58:29.303 --> 02:58:31.219
LAURA: Woo!
SAM: Oh boy.

4059
02:58:31.219 --> 02:58:33.305
MARISHA: Oh my god.
SAM: This nerve-wracking scene--

4060
02:58:33.305 --> 02:58:35.486
MARISHA: I'm fucking freaking out.

4061
02:58:35.486 --> 02:58:37.039
SAM: Brought to you by Dwarvenforge.

4062
02:58:37.039 --> 02:58:39.363
I don't know why it would be
brought to you by Dwarvenforge,

4063
02:58:39.363 --> 02:58:41.459
there's no Dwarvenforge on the table.

4064
02:58:41.459 --> 02:58:42.995
But I have nothing else to say.

4065
02:58:42.995 --> 02:58:45.204
LAURA: All tense moments brought
to you by Dwarvenforge.

4066
02:58:45.204 --> 02:58:48.297
MARISHA: Feels like talking to
an actual fucking king.

4067
02:58:48.297 --> 02:58:50.136
LIAM: Is fancy pants in here?

4068
02:58:50.136 --> 02:58:52.031
SAM: Fancy pants?
LIAM: Vence.

4069
02:58:52.031 --> 02:58:53.326
SAM: Vency pants?

4070
02:58:53.326 --> 02:58:55.522
LAURA: No, he didn't mention him.

4071
02:58:55.522 --> 02:58:58.213
MARISHA: Trying to be very fucking vague, but also--

4072
02:58:58.213 --> 02:59:00.179
LAURA: I think we should say his name.
MARISHA: Should I say his name?

4073
02:59:00.179 --> 02:59:03.046
SAM: I mean--
TALIESIN: What else we going to do?

4074
02:59:05.278 --> 02:59:08.361
MARISHA: We have identification on...

4075
02:59:10.920 --> 02:59:12.461
the man who we believe

4076
02:59:12.461 --> 02:59:15.703
is responsible for placing this device.

4077
02:59:17.127 --> 02:59:20.717
SAM: Can we be sure everyone in
this room is to be trusted?

4078
02:59:20.717 --> 02:59:22.359
Hi, hi, sorry.

4079
02:59:24.011 --> 02:59:27.344
MATT: The king leans forward and goes,

4080
02:59:30.356 --> 02:59:33.080
"You are not a...

4081
02:59:33.080 --> 02:59:35.005
"you're not a usual goblin."

4082
02:59:37.337 --> 02:59:38.729
SAM: No, I'm not.

4083
02:59:41.663 --> 02:59:42.804
MATT: "Curious.

4084
02:59:47.611 --> 02:59:49.261
"Trust is a...

4085
02:59:51.386 --> 02:59:53.536
"flexible thing.

4086
02:59:55.851 --> 02:59:59.268
"Loyalty, that is important.

4087
03:00:00.651 --> 03:00:02.734
"But trust must be earned.

4088
03:00:04.504 --> 03:00:07.987
"Everyone in this chamber, well--"

4089
03:00:08.916 --> 03:00:13.157
and you see looking at you all
and then eyeing to Allura.

4090
03:00:13.157 --> 03:00:17.832
"Those who commonly work within this chamber

4091
03:00:19.004 --> 03:00:23.312
"are as trusted as one can be, which is...

4092
03:00:24.437 --> 03:00:25.628
"mostly.

4093
03:00:26.683 --> 03:00:30.822
"But I am where you see me sitting now

4094
03:00:30.822 --> 03:00:35.731
"because I don't trust anybody completely."

4095
03:00:40.298 --> 03:00:42.332
MARISHA: Why's he looking at me?

4096
03:00:42.332 --> 03:00:44.026
TRAVIS: He was talking to you the most.

4097
03:00:44.026 --> 03:00:45.234
MATT: "So.

4098
03:00:46.992 --> 03:00:49.067
"Who have you identified?"

4099
03:00:52.801 --> 03:00:54.468
MARISHA: His name is Vence.

4100
03:00:55.982 --> 03:00:57.097
MATT: The king immediately leans back

4101
03:00:57.097 --> 03:01:00.897
and looks over towards Martinet Ludinus Da'leth,

4102
03:01:00.897 --> 03:01:03.054
as well as all the members
of the council all look to him,

4103
03:01:03.054 --> 03:01:07.268
and Ludinus goes, "Are you serious?"

4104
03:01:07.268 --> 03:01:08.300
LAURA: Yes.
MARISHA: Yeah.

4105
03:01:08.300 --> 03:01:10.072
LAURA: I saw him with my own eyes.

4106
03:01:10.072 --> 03:01:11.903
TRAVIS: She really doesn't joke, ever.

4107
03:01:11.903 --> 03:01:15.769
MARISHA: Blondie, nice hair, eyes are
a little too close together.

4108
03:01:15.769 --> 03:01:17.102
SAM: Works for you.

4109
03:01:20.364 --> 03:01:22.615
MATT: You watch as he brings his hand across the air

4110
03:01:22.615 --> 03:01:24.633
and begins to draw a faint symbol.

4111
03:01:24.633 --> 03:01:27.201
You recognize it as a spell that you use quite often

4112
03:01:27.201 --> 03:01:30.834
to speak with individuals.
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

4113
03:01:30.834 --> 03:01:33.768
MATT: "Vence, where are you?

4114
03:01:34.783 --> 03:01:36.691
"I need you here.

4115
03:01:36.691 --> 03:01:38.100
"In the castle."

4116
03:01:41.495 --> 03:01:44.047
SAM: (laughs)

4117
03:01:44.047 --> 03:01:45.113
MATT: "Vence?

4118
03:01:48.147 --> 03:01:49.814
"He is not responding."

4119
03:01:50.741 --> 03:01:52.153
(sighs)

4120
03:01:52.153 --> 03:01:54.903
Sends off another spell and goes,

4121
03:01:56.591 --> 03:02:01.066
"Do an all-point search for
Vence, my associate.

4122
03:02:01.066 --> 03:02:03.820
"Lock down Rexxentrum,
do not let him leave.

4123
03:02:03.820 --> 03:02:05.979
"We have to ensure that
we're keeping an eye out."

4124
03:02:05.979 --> 03:02:08.981
TALIESIN: He also has a book, if I recall.

4125
03:02:08.981 --> 03:02:10.253
SAM: Did you scry on him?

4126
03:02:10.253 --> 03:02:13.310
LAURA: I did, I scryed on him when we--

4127
03:02:13.310 --> 03:02:14.704
MARISHA: You did.

4128
03:02:14.704 --> 03:02:17.271
LAURA: When we landed in Rexxentrum.
MATT: Mm-hmm.

4129
03:02:17.271 --> 03:02:21.311
LAURA: I, Laura don't remember,
but Jester would definitely.

4130
03:02:21.311 --> 03:02:23.070
MATT: The last you saw, he was in the cathedral,

4131
03:02:23.070 --> 03:02:25.112
passing over the device to the cardinal.

4132
03:02:25.112 --> 03:02:26.026
LAURA: That's right.

4133
03:02:26.026 --> 03:02:30.218
MATT: And the scrolls that
seemed to inform the ritual

4134
03:02:30.218 --> 03:02:32.213
that was to be set below.
LAURA: I say that out loud.

4135
03:02:32.213 --> 03:02:34.713
MATT: Okay, so you express all of this.
LAURA: Yes.

4136
03:02:38.288 --> 03:02:41.146
MATT: You can see Ludinus taking it in,

4137
03:02:41.146 --> 03:02:43.267
his eyes darting back and forth.

4138
03:02:43.267 --> 03:02:44.876
You can see a bit of a flush to his face

4139
03:02:44.876 --> 03:02:46.293
of embarrassment.

4140
03:02:48.702 --> 03:02:51.094
MARISHA: That's a good sign.

4141
03:02:54.387 --> 03:02:56.194
MATT: "Vence Nuthaleus.

4142
03:02:56.194 --> 03:02:58.611
"They're not to let him leave.

4143
03:02:59.748 --> 03:03:03.588
"Extend this message to
all points in the Empire.

4144
03:03:03.588 --> 03:03:05.921
"All boundaries, all borders.

4145
03:03:10.946 --> 03:03:13.961
"Frustratingly, I just recently
had bequeathed unto him

4146
03:03:13.961 --> 03:03:18.461
"a means of protecting from
divination, at his request.

4147
03:03:20.157 --> 03:03:23.050
"So we're going to have to
do this the hard way."

4148
03:03:23.050 --> 03:03:27.900
Turns to look at the king
and Yudala, and goes,

4149
03:03:29.997 --> 03:03:34.498
"If I might have the assistance
of the Cobalt Soul, perhaps,"

4150
03:03:34.498 --> 03:03:37.103
and Yudala goes, "Of course.

4151
03:03:37.103 --> 03:03:39.445
"We will also spread this information

4152
03:03:39.445 --> 03:03:42.028
and search for this individual."

4153
03:03:43.049 --> 03:03:44.716
At this point,

4154
03:03:44.716 --> 03:03:46.716
the marshal steps forward, actually,

4155
03:03:46.716 --> 03:03:49.196
from below the steps and goes,

4156
03:03:49.196 --> 03:03:52.464
"We have just come from
the Chantry of the Dawn,

4157
03:03:52.464 --> 03:03:55.214
"where it appears that this group,

4158
03:03:56.416 --> 03:04:00.499
"for a point of trusting,
did thwart this attempt.

4159
03:04:01.463 --> 03:04:05.577
"They prevented this terrible
thing from happening,

4160
03:04:05.577 --> 03:04:08.160
"saved a number of Empire lives,

4161
03:04:09.815 --> 03:04:12.232
"according to the witnesses present."

4162
03:04:14.684 --> 03:04:17.757
At which point Sydnok steps forward and goes,

4163
03:04:17.757 --> 03:04:20.627
"Reports state that the Kryn incursion today

4164
03:04:20.627 --> 03:04:25.294
"rapidly ended around the time
that this cult was halted.

4165
03:04:26.336 --> 03:04:27.872
"But yet we still do not have proof

4166
03:04:27.872 --> 03:04:31.627
"there wasn't a sign of collaboration.

4167
03:04:31.627 --> 03:04:34.652
"Nothing but words against words."

4168
03:04:34.652 --> 03:04:37.227
Allura steps forward and goes, "Actually--

4169
03:04:39.635 --> 03:04:41.076
"my apologies.

4170
03:04:41.076 --> 03:04:43.268
"Upon learning of the threat
from the Mighty Nein

4171
03:04:43.268 --> 03:04:47.419
"not but a number of days ago,
I returned myself to Tal'Dorei

4172
03:04:47.419 --> 03:04:50.758
"at their request and insistence
to acquire permission

4173
03:04:50.758 --> 03:04:53.194
"from the rest of our
council to reach out--"

4174
03:04:53.194 --> 03:04:55.196
SAM: The rest of the council?
MATT: "Yes.

4175
03:04:55.196 --> 03:04:59.289
"To reach out to the Bright Queen
on our behalf.

4176
03:04:59.289 --> 03:05:01.529
"The Council of Tal'Dorei."

4177
03:05:01.529 --> 03:05:03.887
The king goes--
ASHLEY: Who's the Council of Tal'Dorei?

4178
03:05:03.887 --> 03:05:05.320
MATT: The king steps forward.

4179
03:05:05.320 --> 03:05:07.973
(laughter)

4180
03:05:07.973 --> 03:05:09.289
MATT: Don't make me roll initiative here.

4181
03:05:09.289 --> 03:05:11.153
(laughter)

4182
03:05:11.153 --> 03:05:13.197
ASHLEY: Well, I haven't asked yet.

4183
03:05:13.197 --> 03:05:16.653
I'm new here, I don't understand--

4184
03:05:16.653 --> 03:05:20.079
I don't know what that is yet,
I was just wondering for--

4185
03:05:20.079 --> 03:05:24.232
MATT: And as Allura says this,
you can see, she's like,

4186
03:05:24.232 --> 03:05:26.849
carefully choosing the words
and seems to be like,

4187
03:05:26.849 --> 03:05:28.656
in that final bit of the sentence,

4188
03:05:28.656 --> 03:05:31.759
"Reach out to the Bright Queen on our behalf,"

4189
03:05:31.759 --> 03:05:33.913
is like, preparing.

4190
03:05:33.913 --> 03:05:36.500
The king immediately shoots forward
in the throne and goes,

4191
03:05:36.500 --> 03:05:40.825
"You parlayed with our enemy
without our consent!"

4192
03:05:42.370 --> 03:05:46.494
At which point Allura goes, "I did so

4193
03:05:46.494 --> 03:05:49.528
"because time was of the essence, apparently.

4194
03:05:50.539 --> 03:05:52.643
"Because the Council of Tal'Dorei remains neutral

4195
03:05:52.643 --> 03:05:55.435
"with the Kryn Dynasty,
I could claim an audience

4196
03:05:55.435 --> 03:05:57.582
"without conflict.

4197
03:05:57.582 --> 03:06:00.100
"I notified them of all that we had learned,

4198
03:06:00.100 --> 03:06:03.100
"the Mighty Nein, and as such myself,

4199
03:06:04.277 --> 03:06:06.384
"about this seeming infiltration of the cult

4200
03:06:06.384 --> 03:06:10.273
"within even their own midst, apparently.

4201
03:06:10.273 --> 03:06:12.345
"And they seemed to be responsive

4202
03:06:12.345 --> 03:06:16.512
"to trusting the word of
these esteemed protectors.

4203
03:06:17.930 --> 03:06:19.936
"Thus the Bright Queen agreed to temporarily

4204
03:06:19.936 --> 03:06:22.228
"withdraw their attack, preventing them

4205
03:06:22.228 --> 03:06:26.228
"unintentionally aiding this
Angel of Irons cult."

4206
03:06:28.786 --> 03:06:30.795
There's a pause, everyone looks at each other,

4207
03:06:30.795 --> 03:06:33.187
looks at you, and kind of-- some of it's a look

4208
03:06:33.187 --> 03:06:36.055
of being impressed, some trying to put together

4209
03:06:36.055 --> 03:06:38.648
what this means.

4210
03:06:38.648 --> 03:06:41.184
The king leans forward once more,

4211
03:06:41.184 --> 03:06:44.284
intensely, his eyes narrowed.

4212
03:06:46.122 --> 03:06:50.205
"They withdrew on your word.

4213
03:06:52.100 --> 03:06:54.859
"On <i>their</i> word.

4214
03:06:56.926 --> 03:06:59.394
"What have been your dealings
with the Bright Queen

4215
03:06:59.394 --> 03:07:01.527
"outside of this, if I might ask,

4216
03:07:01.527 --> 03:07:04.269
"that they would withdraw at the word

4217
03:07:04.269 --> 03:07:07.485
"of a handful of adventurers?"

4218
03:07:09.680 --> 03:07:14.680
LAURA: Well, w-w-we've been working
with Expositor Beauregard.

4219
03:07:14.729 --> 03:07:19.288
MARISHA: I've found, in my line of work, King Dwendal,

4220
03:07:20.738 --> 03:07:23.657
if you're going to learn about your enemy,

4221
03:07:23.657 --> 03:07:25.765
you need to get close to them.

4222
03:07:29.619 --> 03:07:34.092
Luckily, traveling with a band of misfits

4223
03:07:34.092 --> 03:07:36.850
and goblins and half-orcs,

4224
03:07:39.366 --> 03:07:41.745
and Caduceus.

4225
03:07:41.745 --> 03:07:44.726
(laughter)

4226
03:07:44.726 --> 03:07:46.209
TALIESIN: That's fair.

4227
03:07:48.867 --> 03:07:51.846
MARISHA: They were the perfect cover
to get me close,

4228
03:07:51.846 --> 03:07:53.346
without suspicion.

4229
03:07:54.637 --> 03:07:56.184
SAM: You were using us?

4230
03:07:56.184 --> 03:07:58.479
MATT: "What else have you learned in your time

4231
03:07:58.479 --> 03:08:00.312
"with the Bright Queen?"

4232
03:08:01.869 --> 03:08:04.702
He looks genuinely interested now.

4233
03:08:06.109 --> 03:08:10.186
MARISHA: She really wants her fucking beacon back.

4234
03:08:10.186 --> 03:08:11.186
MATT: "The relic?"

4235
03:08:12.550 --> 03:08:13.999
MARISHA: You know where it is?

4236
03:08:13.999 --> 03:08:16.403
MATT: Ludinus steps forward and goes,

4237
03:08:17.445 --> 03:08:22.007
"My liege, times of war make
for unique circumstances.

4238
03:08:22.007 --> 03:08:25.246
"If they have indeed endeared
themselves to the Dynasty,

4239
03:08:25.246 --> 03:08:29.759
"perhaps we could use them to
shift things in our favor.

4240
03:08:29.759 --> 03:08:32.634
"Perhaps to bring an end to this conflict."

4241
03:08:34.172 --> 03:08:36.479
The king's still looking at you and goes,

4242
03:08:36.479 --> 03:08:40.407
"And how do you propose we do this, Ludinus?"

4243
03:08:40.407 --> 03:08:43.461
(as Ludinus) "This relic they mention,
Trent seems to have

4244
03:08:43.461 --> 03:08:46.252
"recently uncovered the relic that the Dynasty

4245
03:08:46.252 --> 03:08:48.599
"has accused us of having stolen.

4246
03:08:49.457 --> 03:08:53.098
"The challenges we've had
in finding a ground to bargain

4247
03:08:53.098 --> 03:08:56.926
"may be turning in our favor, my liege.

4248
03:08:56.926 --> 03:08:58.684
"Using these nine.

4249
03:09:00.351 --> 03:09:01.776
"Seven."

4250
03:09:01.776 --> 03:09:04.231
LAURA: Well, and Sprinkle.

4251
03:09:04.231 --> 03:09:06.497
MATT: "Seven and a half. "
TRAVIS: (high voice) "Please."

4252
03:09:06.497 --> 03:09:07.913
(laughter)

4253
03:09:07.913 --> 03:09:09.210
SAM: "Kill me."

4254
03:09:09.210 --> 03:09:13.261
MATT: "Using these operatives perhaps
as a mediation tool,

4255
03:09:13.261 --> 03:09:16.236
"maybe we can bring this
conflict to a close."

4256
03:09:17.812 --> 03:09:20.520
Allura and the others look about
each other curiously.

4257
03:09:20.520 --> 03:09:22.266
Trent nods with a smile, his eyes falling

4258
03:09:22.266 --> 03:09:23.637
onto Caleb briefly.

4259
03:09:23.637 --> 03:09:25.492
SAM: Oof.
LAURA: Oh no.

4260
03:09:25.492 --> 03:09:29.471
MATT: King Dwendal goes: (sighing)

4261
03:09:29.471 --> 03:09:32.406
"And the Assembly feels this course is viable?"

4262
03:09:32.406 --> 03:09:34.073
Trent steps forward.

4263
03:09:37.189 --> 03:09:39.281
"We do, my liege."

4264
03:09:39.281 --> 03:09:41.197
"An optimistic view.

4265
03:09:46.250 --> 03:09:48.321
(as Dwendal) "Then I shall allow it.

4266
03:09:48.321 --> 03:09:53.321
"You, Mighty Nein, you stand
on the edge of treason

03:09:54.144 --> 03:09:56.401
"for your dealings with the enemy,

4268
03:09:56.401 --> 03:09:58.158
"so do not squander this opportunity

4269
03:09:58.158 --> 03:10:01.075
"to prove your worth and allegiance.

4270
03:10:02.533 --> 03:10:05.277
"You will operate under the
guidance of the martinet

03:10:05.277 --> 03:10:07.732
"in arranging this parlay.

03:10:07.732 --> 03:10:11.565
"Use your influence to bring them to the table,

"and ensure the return of this relic

03:10:15.039 --> 03:10:18.181
"is received as a token to end this conflict.

4275
03:10:19.029 --> 03:10:22.381
"Should you fail, then I give you
over to the prime arbiter

4276
03:10:22.381 --> 03:10:25.261
"for judgment," and points to Sydnok Truscan,

4277
03:10:25.261 --> 03:10:26.920
who is just listening quietly,

4278
03:10:26.920 --> 03:10:30.735
and while has not been involved
in this conversation

4279
03:10:30.735 --> 03:10:32.730
as much as the others,
has been very carefully

4280
03:10:32.730 --> 03:10:36.170
watching each of you in your reactions.

4281
03:10:36.170 --> 03:10:40.065
Allura rolls her eyes and
crosses her arms in a huff.

4282
03:10:40.065 --> 03:10:42.829
The king speaks up once more.

4283
03:10:43.813 --> 03:10:46.357
"I have a people to protect.

4284
03:10:46.357 --> 03:10:50.533
"Innocents and families,
who suffer at the hands

4285
03:10:50.533 --> 03:10:52.450
"of this unprovoked war.

4286
03:10:54.435 --> 03:10:56.597
"Nothing is more important to me

4287
03:10:56.597 --> 03:11:00.047
"than maintaining the safety and sanctity

4288
03:11:00.047 --> 03:11:02.380
"of the Dwendalian citizenry.

4289
03:11:03.637 --> 03:11:07.513
"If we can end this conflict, and keep to our ends

03:11:07.513 --> 03:11:10.022
"of the Ashkeeper Peaks, then that would be

4291
03:11:10.022 --> 03:11:11.672
"a great victory, yes?"

4292
03:11:12.572 --> 03:11:14.853
LAURA: Does he seem like that's
what he really wants?

4293
03:11:14.853 --> 03:11:16.853
MATT: Make an Insight check.

4294
03:11:20.065 --> 03:11:24.494
LAURA: Never works anyway for me,
because I roll like shit all the time.

4295
03:11:24.494 --> 03:11:25.660
Seven.

4296
03:11:26.836 --> 03:11:28.310
SAM: And a half.

4297
03:11:28.310 --> 03:11:30.213
LAURA: Seven and a half.

4298
03:11:30.213 --> 03:11:33.286
MATT: You try and follow, but just
the force of his presence

4299
03:11:33.286 --> 03:11:34.870
in itself is intimidating enough

4300
03:11:34.870 --> 03:11:36.675
that you're not able to get much of a read.

4301
03:11:36.675 --> 03:11:39.748
LAURA: I don't even know what
he's saying, you guys.

4302
03:11:39.748 --> 03:11:42.699
TALIESIN: We may need some time to recuperate,

4303
03:11:42.699 --> 03:11:46.449
before anything is really--

4304
03:11:47.967 --> 03:11:50.342
I'm having trouble even following this.

4305
03:11:50.342 --> 03:11:52.086
MATT: "Of course.

4306
03:11:52.086 --> 03:11:54.343
"The martinet will take care of it for you.

4307
03:11:54.343 --> 03:11:57.959
"See that you do not fail our great Empire."

4308
03:11:57.959 --> 03:12:02.959
TRAVIS: Your majesty, if I may,
these dealings of course

4309
03:12:02.970 --> 03:12:07.911
will be very dangerous,
I'm sure you can appreciate.

4310
03:12:09.158 --> 03:12:13.868
Pardon my asking, are your intentions
to deliver this relic,

4311
03:12:13.868 --> 03:12:18.776
if we can secure a peaceful
resolution to this war?

4312
03:12:21.963 --> 03:12:25.213
MATT: Puts his hand towards Ludinus and
Trent, and Ludinus goes,

4313
03:12:25.213 --> 03:12:27.832
"Of course, it doesn't serve us any purpose.

4314
03:12:27.832 --> 03:12:32.692
"Now that we've uncovered it,
to return it would be easy.

4315
03:12:32.692 --> 03:12:34.886
"And hopefully, if this is indeed their intent,

4316
03:12:34.886 --> 03:12:37.206
"as they say it is, then it will end it.

4317
03:12:37.206 --> 03:12:39.564
"If it is not, that only proves
that they will not rest

4318
03:12:39.564 --> 03:12:43.601
"until all of us are dead and under the ground."

4319
03:12:43.601 --> 03:12:46.183
TRAVIS: I am confident that we will be able

4320
03:12:46.183 --> 03:12:48.789
to find a way to resolve this.

4321
03:12:48.789 --> 03:12:51.968
I would only ask, do you
have any further terms

4322
03:12:51.968 --> 03:12:53.976
for engaging in this talk?

4323
03:12:53.976 --> 03:12:55.429
Does it need to be here, does it need to be

4324
03:12:55.429 --> 03:12:58.675
on neutral ground, is there anything
you will not consider?

4325
03:12:58.675 --> 03:13:00.035
MATT: The king leans forward.

4326
03:13:00.035 --> 03:13:02.115
"Well, since you seem to be the experts."

4327
03:13:02.115 --> 03:13:04.086
SAM: Negotiator.
(laughter)

4328
03:13:04.086 --> 03:13:07.154
"As you seem to be the
experts on the Dynasty,

4329
03:13:07.154 --> 03:13:12.154
"with your dealings, I leave
those details in your hands."

4330
03:13:13.176 --> 03:13:16.093
TRAVIS: We appreciate your trust, my liege.

4331
03:13:17.114 --> 03:13:18.898
MATT: "Now."

4332
03:13:18.898 --> 03:13:21.803
He raises his hand in a dismissing motion.

4333
03:13:21.803 --> 03:13:25.555
The rest of the council around you breaks off a bit.

4334
03:13:25.555 --> 03:13:29.488
Takes the note that this
meeting has been adjourned.

4335
03:13:31.997 --> 03:13:34.755
Schreiber, the gnome, turns and
begins to talk to the king

4336
03:13:34.755 --> 03:13:36.864
quietly off to the side while Allura

4337
03:13:36.864 --> 03:13:40.517
rushes over to you, with a smile.

4338
03:13:41.692 --> 03:13:43.275
"Well done.

4339
03:13:43.275 --> 03:13:44.929
"Whew."

4340
03:13:44.929 --> 03:13:47.749
LAURA: Thank you.
TALIESIN: Everything hurts.

4341
03:13:47.749 --> 03:13:49.891
TRAVIS: Intimidating room.

4342
03:13:49.891 --> 03:13:54.517
MARISHA: We're apparently on
the edge of being traitors,

4343
03:13:54.517 --> 03:13:59.517
but yes, I guess we did a job well done.

4344
03:13:59.637 --> 03:14:01.251
LIAM: Par for the course.

4345
03:14:01.251 --> 03:14:03.147
ASHLEY: Hello.

4346
03:14:03.147 --> 03:14:05.078
MATT: "Hello.

4347
03:14:05.078 --> 03:14:08.246
"Your friends spoke quite highly of you.

4348
03:14:08.246 --> 03:14:10.729
"We managed to

4349
03:14:12.063 --> 03:14:14.526
"utilize their connection with you

4350
03:14:14.526 --> 03:14:16.785
"to look into your well-being.

4351
03:14:16.785 --> 03:14:20.772
"I'm glad to see that you're all right?"

4352
03:14:20.772 --> 03:14:23.778
ASHLEY: Well, we'll see.

4353
03:14:23.778 --> 03:14:25.324
MATT: "I'm Allura Vysoren."

4354
03:14:25.324 --> 03:14:26.582
ASHLEY: Hello.

4355
03:14:30.091 --> 03:14:32.481
My name is Yasha.

4356
03:14:32.481 --> 03:14:33.814
MATT: "So I've heard.

4357
03:14:36.544 --> 03:14:40.561
"Well, I need to check in,

4358
03:14:40.561 --> 03:14:43.353
"and if perhaps--"

4359
03:14:43.353 --> 03:14:45.515
and turns back, and the king gives her a look

4360
03:14:45.515 --> 03:14:48.791
and says, "Not you, them."

4361
03:14:49.698 --> 03:14:54.494
She goes, "Well, if you need anything
that I <i>can</i> do, let me know."

4362
03:14:54.494 --> 03:14:56.330
TRAVIS: That was very brave, what you did.

4363
03:14:56.330 --> 03:14:57.816
You took quite the initiative.

4364
03:14:57.816 --> 03:14:59.113
MATT: "(chuckles)

4365
03:14:59.113 --> 03:15:01.386
"Trust me, I've done far stupider."

4366
03:15:02.644 --> 03:15:03.894
TRAVIS: I believe it.

4367
03:15:05.079 --> 03:15:07.130
LIAM: Things are moving faster than either

4368
03:15:07.130 --> 03:15:09.997
of these nations can track.

4369
03:15:09.997 --> 03:15:13.888
If you and the Tal'Dorei Council,
whoever they may be,

4370
03:15:13.888 --> 03:15:17.554
can do anything to stay
one step ahead of it,

4371
03:15:18.513 --> 03:15:21.168
please, do so.

4372
03:15:21.168 --> 03:15:23.185
It is too much for us alone.

4373
03:15:23.185 --> 03:15:24.268
MATT: "Understood."

4374
03:15:25.180 --> 03:15:30.130
SAM: Oh, sorry, and if we need a
neutral place to meet,

4375
03:15:31.631 --> 03:15:34.881
to organize a meeting for these two nations,

4376
03:15:34.881 --> 03:15:38.747
maybe it could be in your nation?

4377
03:15:38.747 --> 03:15:43.320
MATT: "I do not think the king would be interested

4378
03:15:43.320 --> 03:15:47.547
"in dragging this to distant foreign soil."

4379
03:15:47.547 --> 03:15:50.254
LAURA: Well, maybe like another
plane of existence or something.

4380
03:15:50.254 --> 03:15:52.604
That would be pretty cool.
SAM: Sure, sure, sure.

4381
03:15:52.604 --> 03:15:56.227
MATT: At which point you can see
Ludinus steps up behind her.

4382
03:15:56.227 --> 03:15:57.736
(as Allura) "I'm certain you could work out the details

4383
03:15:57.736 --> 03:16:00.987
"with the individual of which you are charged.

4384
03:16:00.987 --> 03:16:02.570
"Martinet."

4385
03:16:02.570 --> 03:16:04.253
(as Ludinus) "Arcanist."

4386
03:16:05.214 --> 03:16:06.683
(as Allura) "I'll take my leave.

4387
03:16:06.683 --> 03:16:08.290
"Good luck."

4388
03:16:08.290 --> 03:16:12.100
And then Allura heads down the stairs.

4389
03:16:12.100 --> 03:16:13.900
LAURA: You called him by his first name

4390
03:16:13.900 --> 03:16:15.491
instead of by his title, that's pretty cool.

4391
03:16:15.491 --> 03:16:16.965
MATT: Yeah. (laughs)

4392
03:16:16.965 --> 03:16:17.963
MARISHA: Whoops.

4393
03:16:17.963 --> 03:16:19.436
MATT: Super familiar.

4394
03:16:19.436 --> 03:16:23.017
LIAM: What's Ikithon been doing all this time?

4395
03:16:23.017 --> 03:16:24.492
MATT: Is actually about 10 feet behind--

4396
03:16:24.492 --> 03:16:26.837
TRAVIS: You mean Trent?
MATT: --yeah, behind Ludinus.

4397
03:16:26.837 --> 03:16:28.487
SAM: T-Money.

4398
03:16:28.487 --> 03:16:32.877
MATT: And Trent is in the
process of gathering robes

4399
03:16:32.877 --> 03:16:35.917
over one shoulder, and about to
turn in your direction.

4400
03:16:35.917 --> 03:16:39.744
LAURA: No.
MATT: Ludinus goes, "Very well.

4401
03:16:39.744 --> 03:16:42.263
"Reach out to your contacts to aid

4402
03:16:42.263 --> 03:16:44.472
"in arranging such a meeting.

4403
03:16:44.472 --> 03:16:47.137
"We shall convene come the
noonday sun tomorrow.

4404
03:16:47.137 --> 03:16:50.247
"I'll arrange for lodging
within the Camarouth Cottage

4405
03:16:50.247 --> 03:16:52.164
"here within the Shimmer Ward.

4406
03:16:52.164 --> 03:16:54.759
"I will greet you there in the morrow."

4407
03:16:54.759 --> 03:16:57.178
LAURA: It's going to be at least tomorrow morning

4408
03:16:57.178 --> 03:17:02.037
before I can contact anybody,
because I'm pretty spent.

4409
03:17:02.037 --> 03:17:03.844
Just letting you know.

4410
03:17:03.844 --> 03:17:06.287
MATT: "You look it, but apparently
you've been quite busy today,

4411
03:17:06.287 --> 03:17:10.464
"so take your rest. This is
a high-end establishment.

4412
03:17:10.464 --> 03:17:15.297
"We'll convene and figure out
what you plan in the morning."

4413
03:17:16.463 --> 03:17:18.456
SAM: Thank you.

4414
03:17:18.456 --> 03:17:22.272
Will we be escorted to this place,
or are we on our own?

4415
03:17:22.272 --> 03:17:23.782
MATT: "There'll be an escort."

4416
03:17:23.782 --> 03:17:26.313
And looks over towards the marshal
and the marshal goes,

4417
03:17:26.313 --> 03:17:28.431
"Of course, Martinet."

4418
03:17:28.431 --> 03:17:30.998
(as Ludinus) "Good, I will see you then."

4419
03:17:30.998 --> 03:17:33.756
Turns around and exits down the staircase.

4420
03:17:33.756 --> 03:17:37.596
As you guys begin to follow, Trent wanders,

4421
03:17:37.596 --> 03:17:39.453
saunters up beside your group.

4422
03:17:39.453 --> 03:17:41.222
LAURA: I stand in front of Caleb.

4423
03:17:41.222 --> 03:17:43.979
MARISHA: Yeah, I stand on the other side.

4424
03:17:43.979 --> 03:17:48.106
MATT: "Impressive business, isn't it?

4425
03:17:48.106 --> 03:17:52.169
"You've come far from simple
sell-swords and pit fighters."

4426
03:17:52.169 --> 03:17:53.840
Looking towards Yasha.

4427
03:17:53.840 --> 03:17:55.604
"Especially you, Bren."

4428
03:17:55.604 --> 03:17:58.084
SAM: (gasps)

4429
03:17:58.084 --> 03:18:01.399
And then just continues walking,
following after Ludinus.

4430
03:18:01.399 --> 03:18:03.382
TRAVIS: (laughs) Oh fuck.

4431
03:18:03.382 --> 03:18:05.028
Holy shit.

4432
03:18:05.028 --> 03:18:07.222
LAURA: I don't like him.

4433
03:18:07.222 --> 03:18:08.695
ASHLEY: Should I go kill him?

4434
03:18:08.695 --> 03:18:10.278
SAM: No, no.
TALIESIN: You can.

4435
03:18:12.321 --> 03:18:15.035
ASHLEY: Just, I don't like him,
he rubs me the wrong way.

4436
03:18:15.035 --> 03:18:16.948
TRAVIS: Maybe you should act on impulse.

4437
03:18:16.948 --> 03:18:19.041
ASHLEY: I was making a bit of a joke, but.

4438
03:18:19.041 --> 03:18:19.874
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4439
03:18:20.712 --> 03:18:24.862
MATT: As you guys descend the stairs

4440
03:18:24.862 --> 03:18:27.221
towards the opening of the chamber,

4441
03:18:27.221 --> 03:18:30.114
the marshal and the same escort guard,

4442
03:18:30.114 --> 03:18:33.967
though half the size as previous,
just a general escort.

4443
03:18:33.967 --> 03:18:38.666
Less of a herding as it was
upon your arrival to the castle.

4444
03:18:38.666 --> 03:18:41.720
Begins to lead you back
through the lengthy chambers

4445
03:18:41.720 --> 03:18:46.444
of the inside of Ungebroch,
and back out to the Shimmer Ward,

4446
03:18:46.444 --> 03:18:49.077
to lead you to the Camarouth Cottage,

4447
03:18:49.077 --> 03:18:53.701
and whatever the next stage
in this endeavor entails.

4448
03:18:53.701 --> 03:18:55.519
And that's where we're going to
go ahead and end tonight.

4449
03:18:55.519 --> 03:18:56.686
(groaning)
TRAVIS: In the Shimmerwood?

4450
03:18:56.686 --> 03:18:58.519
MATT: Shimmer Ward.
TRAVIS: Shimmer Ward.

4451
03:18:58.519 --> 03:19:00.747
MATT: It's the ward it's in.
TALIESIN: Shimmer Ward.

4452
03:19:00.747 --> 03:19:02.539
LIAM: Ugh, ugh!
MATT: (laughs)

4453
03:19:02.539 --> 03:19:04.473
SAM: Matt, the castle is the Unka Crock?

4454
03:19:04.473 --> 03:19:06.473
LIAM: Ungebroch.
MATT: Ungebroch.

4455
03:19:06.473 --> 03:19:07.979
SAM: Ungebroch?

4456
03:19:07.979 --> 03:19:10.176
LIAM: Unga, like oonga boonga. Broch.

4457
03:19:10.176 --> 03:19:14.667
MATT: Ungebrochen is an actual
full German phrase.

4458
03:19:14.667 --> 03:19:18.055
I have to remember,
I think it means like unbroken.

4459
03:19:18.055 --> 03:19:19.034
MARISHA: Holy fucking shit.

4460
03:19:19.034 --> 03:19:20.326
MATT: I'll double-check again,
I'm sure I'll be corrected.

4461
03:19:20.326 --> 03:19:21.621
TRAVIS: He fucking knows!

4462
03:19:21.621 --> 03:19:22.832
SAM: He knows who you are.

4463
03:19:22.832 --> 03:19:24.298
TRAVIS: ♪ He knows ♪

4464
03:19:24.298 --> 03:19:26.184
LAURA: Of course he knows.
SAM: We've done nothing to him.

4465
03:19:26.184 --> 03:19:27.180
TRAVIS: We are in the mouse trap.

4466
03:19:27.180 --> 03:19:30.272
SAM: You've done nothing to him,
he's done stuff to you.

4467
03:19:30.272 --> 03:19:31.904
LAURA: He ran away.

4468
03:19:31.904 --> 03:19:34.421
SAM: Yeah, that just-- yeah.

4469
03:19:34.421 --> 03:19:35.903
LIAM: Killed one of his.

4470
03:19:35.903 --> 03:19:37.336
SAM: Wait, you killed one of his?

4471
03:19:37.336 --> 03:19:39.545
LIAM: Killed one of his.
SAM: Who?

4472
03:19:39.545 --> 03:19:40.777
LIAM: Nevermind.

4473
03:19:40.777 --> 03:19:42.686
(Sam and Laura gasping)

4474
03:19:42.686 --> 03:19:44.945
LAURA: Oh, we just got a little story.

4475
03:19:44.945 --> 03:19:46.313
TRAVIS: Was that a slip?

4476
03:19:46.313 --> 03:19:48.246
LIAM: No, I think it's been dropped.

4477
03:19:48.246 --> 03:19:49.555
MATT: Yeah.

4478
03:19:49.555 --> 03:19:54.368
So, anyway, we'll pick up
there next week. (laughs)

4479
03:19:54.368 --> 03:19:56.463
LIAM: Fucking campaign.
TRAVIS: Nice job.

4480
03:19:56.463 --> 03:19:58.184
Handled yourself well.

4481
03:19:58.184 --> 03:20:01.004
SAM: Oh yeah, Marisha Ray.
LAURA: Good job, good job.

4482
03:20:01.004 --> 03:20:03.402
SAM: Wow.
TRAVIS: Good job, Expositor.

4483
03:20:03.402 --> 03:20:04.804
MARISHA: (laughs)

4484
03:20:04.804 --> 03:20:06.999
LAURA: Expositor Beau!
MARISHA: It's terrifying.

4485
03:20:06.999 --> 03:20:09.293
SAM: You've been exposited.

4486
03:20:09.293 --> 03:20:11.350
MATT: (laughs)
MARISHA: Oh my god.

4487
03:20:11.350 --> 03:20:12.921
That was so fucking stressful.

4488
03:20:12.921 --> 03:20:15.490
LIAM: Talking to Donald Rumsfeld,
and you're like, "So, Donny..."

4489
03:20:15.490 --> 03:20:17.246
MATT: (laughs)

4490
03:20:17.246 --> 03:20:18.880
TRAVIS: We also need to add the number of words

4491
03:20:18.880 --> 03:20:21.024
that Caduceus put together in consecutive order

4492
03:20:21.024 --> 03:20:22.433
to the leaderboard.
LAURA: Out loud.

4493
03:20:22.433 --> 03:20:25.288
TALIESIN: He was having a panic attack,
man, he was just-- oh god.

4494
03:20:25.288 --> 03:20:27.481
(laughter)

4495
03:20:27.481 --> 03:20:29.127
Nope-- what-- no, it's happening.

4496
03:20:29.127 --> 03:20:30.076
Okay.

4497
03:20:30.076 --> 03:20:31.410
LIAM: Is this what they call civilization?

4498
03:20:31.410 --> 03:20:33.305
TALIESIN: Yeah, this is a lot.

4499
03:20:33.305 --> 03:20:35.612
This is a really big room.

4500
03:20:35.612 --> 03:20:37.844
It's the biggest room I've ever seen.

4501
03:20:37.844 --> 03:20:40.872
How do you get the ceiling on this? Wow!

4502
03:20:40.872 --> 03:20:41.705
Okay.

4503
03:20:41.705 --> 03:20:44.415
MATT: (laughs)

4504
03:20:44.415 --> 03:20:46.631
Awesome, we'll look forward to next week,

4505
03:20:46.631 --> 03:20:48.404
to pick up from here.

4506
03:20:48.404 --> 03:20:50.783
(chuckles)

4507
03:20:50.783 --> 03:20:53.647
Until then, thank you guys so much for joining us,

4508
03:20:53.647 --> 03:20:56.443
we love you very much, and is it Thursday yet?

4509
03:20:56.443 --> 03:20:57.963
Good night.
(cheering)

4510
03:20:57.963 --> 03:21:00.713
(dramatic music)

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.942
MATT: Hello everyone and welcome tonight's episode
of Critical Role, where a bunch of us nerdy ass

00:00:03.942 --> 00:00:06.746
voice actors sit around and play Dungeons &amp;
Dragons.

00:00:06.746 --> 00:00:09.416
(cheering)

00:00:09.416 --> 00:00:11.581
MATT: We thankfully, and happily, have Laura back
this week going on.

00:00:11.581 --> 00:00:15.743
LAURA: No more of you doing my voice, Matt?

00:00:15.743 --> 00:00:20.487
MATT: That wasn't going to happen ever again. The
internet has spoken, nobody wants that.

00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:23.230
MARISHA: I love the shade she threw you in her
spare time.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.625
MATT: Oh yeah, plenty of shade!

00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:30.256
LIAM: That's not the Laura I know.

00:00:30.256 --> 00:00:31.168
LAURA: What? No!

00:00:31.168 --> 00:00:34.197
LIAM: We have the whole gang here.

00:00:34.197 --> 00:00:40.323
MATT: We do. I love it. Before we jump into the
actual story of tonight's game, we have some quick

00:00:40.323 --> 00:00:45.035
announcements to get through. First and foremost,
we have two fantastic sponsors tonight. First up,

00:00:45.035 --> 00:00:52.623
we have for this evening, Archer: Danger Island.
As a long-time fan of Archer, I'm excited that

00:00:52.623 --> 00:00:56.334
today's episode is brought to you by Archer:
Danger Island. That is the new season that

00:00:56.334 --> 00:01:03.692
premiers on FX Wednesday, April 25th at 10:00pm,
so next week, check it out. It'll start there.

00:01:03.692 --> 00:01:08.880
Season nine centers on the semi-functioning
alcohol seaplane pilot, Sterling Archer, as we

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:18.849
know, a lush on a lush South Pacific island of
Mitimotu in 1939. While the rest of the world is

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:23.380
concerned about the impending Second World War,
Archer is only concerned with who is buying his

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:31.580
next drink. Along with his trusty copilot, Pam,
one of my favorite characters, Sterling must

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.464
navigate quicksand, cannibals, super-intelligent
monkeys, poison darts, and pirates. That's right,

00:01:36.464 --> 00:01:42.330
folks. Somehow they jumped the shark into even
better shark-infested waters.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.500
TRAVIS: We can get H. Jon Benjamin on this show,
right?

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.048
MATT: I'm all about it. I would love that. I love
him so much. He's so great.

00:01:47.048 --> 00:01:48.942
TALIESIN: Sometimes when you jump the shark,
there's just more sharks there.

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:54.069
MATT: That's great. There's just a bunch of
sharks. Stay turnt for the break. Catch a special

00:01:54.069 --> 00:02:00.711
video that Nerdist created in partnership with FX,
creating our dream Archer: Danger Island board

00:02:00.711 --> 00:02:06.619
game at LDN to celebrate the new season. So check
that out at the break. Our second sponsor and

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.966
returning sponsor, our fantastic friends,
eternally with this campaign, D&amp;D Beyond.

00:02:10.966 --> 00:02:12.830
ALL: D&amp;D Beyond!

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.065
SAM: Yes! (stuttering)

00:02:19.045 --> 00:02:20.897
TRAVIS: False start, Redskins!

00:02:20.897 --> 00:02:27.808
SAM: D&amp;D Beyond is raising money for our greatest,
favorite charity, 826LA. They're doing a big push

00:02:27.808 --> 00:02:33.361
now to raise money for this great organization
that promotes literacy for young people everywhere

00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:40.636
and as part of the 826LA charity initiative, now
that we're way past our $10,000 tier, D&amp;D Beyond

00:02:40.636 --> 00:02:49.501
has offered up the discount code "826LA" to get
25% off the Legendary Bundle. The Legendary Bundle

00:02:49.501 --> 00:02:55.406
includes all the digital materials available at
D&amp;D Beyond, so check it out now and as part of

00:02:55.406 --> 00:03:02.167
what they announced last week, D&amp;D Beyond is
contributing $100 to 826LA for every natural one

00:03:02.167 --> 00:03:04.711
we roll and to honor that--

00:03:04.711 --> 00:03:07.258
TRAVIS: Oh god. Oh no.

00:03:07.258 --> 00:03:08.969
MARISHA: What is that?!

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:12.952
SAM: I've written a folk song.

00:03:13.702 --> 00:03:16.218
MARISHA: I didn't know you played.

00:03:16.218 --> 00:03:19.408
LIAM: Three episodes from now, he's going to bring
in a gospel band.

00:03:19.408 --> 00:03:20.611
SAM: I don't play.

00:03:20.611 --> 00:03:24.125
MATT: This Cold War escalation is going to kill us
all.

00:03:24.125 --> 00:03:27.471
SAM: I need participation for this one, guys.

00:03:27.471 --> 00:03:28.292
ASHLEY: You got it.

00:03:28.292 --> 00:03:33.807
SAM: When I call for it, you have to say the

TRAVIS: Delete that shit!

00:04:44.251 --> 00:04:51.431
MATT: Thank you, Sam! Thank you, D&amp;D Beyond. Thank
you, our friends at FX and Archer. Running off

00:04:51.431 --> 00:04:56.377
that, too, to go off to 826 initiative that we're
doing right now for this very special fundraising

00:04:56.377 --> 00:05:02.903
campaign. Many thanks to one of our fantastic
Critters, Mark K., who's offered to match every

00:05:02.903 --> 00:05:10.918
single dollar that you donate, up to $40,000. Many
other companies are offering to match donations as

00:05:10.918 --> 00:05:15.990
well, so as much as you can do, it's going to
expand progressively, so thank you for everything

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.206
there. If you want to check it out, we've unlocked
a bunch of tiers and we have a few more to unlock

00:05:20.206 --> 00:05:26.274
as well. Go to 826la.org/criticalrole, you see
where we are and how you can help with their

00:05:26.274 --> 00:05:33.481
fantastic organization. Once again, reminder,
Twitch Prime! If you have Amazon Prime, you can

00:05:33.481 --> 00:05:39.608
connect your Twitch account and get, once a month,
free. Go ahead and give your patronage to a Twitch

00:05:39.608 --> 00:05:42.040
channel of your choice. That's the word I was
looking for.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.112
TRAVIS: It's every month, right? You can't toggle
it, so it's something that keeps happening?

00:05:45.112 --> 00:05:49.038
MARISHA: No, you have to do it every month, It's
really obnoxious.

00:05:49.038 --> 00:05:51.228
LAURA: But it's free!

00:05:51.228 --> 00:05:57.223
MARISHA: It's free! Everyone asks if it supports
us, we get a lesser cut or more cut, it supports

00:05:57.223 --> 00:05:58.429
us the exact same way.

00:05:58.429 --> 00:06:03.474
MATT: Yeah. Off that note, we have new Twitch
emotes available for those who are subscribed to

00:06:03.474 --> 00:06:08.201
the channel. Based on the various tiers, there are
plenty of new emotes with the Mighty Nein related,

00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:14.436
as well as the nine itself on the dice. Look for
that in the subscription tiers. Critical Recap, of

00:06:14.436 --> 00:06:18.444
course, is up if you need a refresher for campaign
two, our fantastic Dani Carr does refreshers every

00:06:18.444 --> 00:06:22.149
episode. They come out the Thursdays before the
episode. I'm sure if you were here earlier, you

00:06:22.149 --> 00:06:27.105
saw this week's refresher of last week's episode.
If you need to get caught up or get your friends

00:06:27.105 --> 00:06:30.371
caught up quickly to watch live, that's how you do
so, so look for it on YouTube under Critical

00:06:30.371 --> 00:06:38.406
Recap. Not right now. Talks Machina, of course,
every Tuesday evening, our fantastic Brian W.

00:06:38.406 --> 00:06:45.768
Foster will be hosting. Next Tuesday at 7:00pm
Pacific regarding tonight's episode, so check that

00:06:45.768 --> 00:06:49.178
out. We will have a few cast members there to
discuss the events that shall unfold before you

00:06:49.178 --> 00:06:56.895
later this evening. He also smells like cabbage.
The podcast of episode 14 from last week is

00:06:56.895 --> 00:06:59.867
available for download for all fine podcast users
out there. If you're listening to the audio

00:06:59.867 --> 00:07:04.430
versions of it and you haven't seen the last
episode and you're waiting for the podcast, well,

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:08.822
you can listen to both and watch tonight. It would
be really confusing, but you can. That's an option

00:07:08.822 --> 00:07:21.465
now, so congratulations. I think that's-- Oh, the
comic book that just came out. Issue six, which is

00:07:21.465 --> 00:07:29.075
fantastic. The final issue of our six episode arc
of Vox Machina: Origins is available. Check it out

00:07:29.075 --> 00:07:33.355
if you haven't yet, especially if you were waiting
for them all to come out, now you can do that, and

00:07:33.355 --> 00:07:38.825
we'll have news soon about an actual hard release
you can hold in your hands. That's exciting.

00:07:38.825 --> 00:07:41.043
LIAM: The glory of Grog in that issue.

00:07:41.043 --> 00:07:41.607
TRAVIS: Yes.

00:07:41.607 --> 00:07:43.574
LAURA: Glory be to Grog.

00:07:43.574 --> 00:07:50.000
MATT: Don't forget Pillars of Eternity II:
Deadfire comes out very soon, in just a few weeks.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.241
For those who haven't played the first Pillars of
Eternity, you don't have to. The sequel gets you

00:07:54.241 --> 00:07:57.374
pretty up to speed if you haven't played, but if
you have, you can carry over your save from the

00:07:57.374 --> 00:08:02.412
previous one. I recommend you play it if you have
the time. This one is amazing-looking. They

00:08:02.412 --> 00:08:08.466
partnered with us, all of us get to voice cast
members of the new game and there's free DLC where

00:08:08.466 --> 00:08:14.327
you get to download portraits and voice sets of
Vox Machina from Critical Role to use in the game.

00:08:14.336 --> 00:08:19.677
LIAM: They have just teased the first Critical
Role Vox Machina portrait of Pickle.

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:22.669
MATT: That's right. Pike's portrait was unveiled.

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:25.093
SAM: The full portrait? Not the pixelated one?

00:08:25.093 --> 00:08:28.270
LIAM: Everyone else is pixelated, but Pickle has
been revealed.

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:28.974
TRAVIS: Yeah!

00:08:28.974 --> 00:08:31.189
ASHLEY: I didn't know that.

00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:38.202
MATT: If you want to preorder it, you can preorder
it at versusevil.com/criticalrole, and that's also

00:08:38.202 --> 00:08:44.969
where you can see the portrait. Super excited for
that. I think with that, folks, our announcements

00:08:44.969 --> 00:08:45.396
are done.

00:08:45.396 --> 00:08:57.949
LAURA: Wait, I'm coughing tonight a lot, so if I
do, everybody just stop and stare at me. So if I

00:08:57.949 --> 00:09:02.055
get up and leave, that's what happened. I don't
want to have a coughing fit on screen.

00:09:02.055 --> 00:09:03.088
TRAVIS: Or you pooped your pants.

00:09:03.088 --> 00:09:03.798
LAURA: Or I pooped my pants.

00:09:03.798 --> 00:09:07.229
LIAM: You're allowed to do any of those things.

00:09:07.229 --> 00:09:12.503
MATT: Awesome. Thank you for the update, Laura.

00:09:12.503 --> 00:09:14.118
LAURA: Yeah, sorry, I just wanted to put that out
there.

00:09:14.118 --> 00:09:20.392
MATT: No, it's good. With that, guys, let's go
ahead and get started with tonight's episode of

00:09:20.392 --> 00:09:21.326
Critical Role.

00:09:21.326 --> 00:09:26.880
[click, TV static]

00:09:26.880 --> 00:10:44.807
[groovy Critical Role theme]

00:10:44.807 --> 00:10:49.108
MATT: And welcome back, everyone. That was pretty
weak.

00:10:49.108 --> 00:10:50.005
TRAVIS: I know. I'm sorry.

00:10:50.005 --> 00:10:57.071
MATT: Last time we left off, The Mighty Nein had
gone towards The Evening Nip, where they had

00:10:57.071 --> 00:11:05.630
finally crawled into the subterranean, hidden,
basement/tavern where The Gentleman does his

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:13.425
business. You had encountered Yasha who joined
back up with the party. You had a brief discussion

00:11:13.425 --> 00:11:19.598
with this Gentleman, which led to a bit of
card-sharkery from Fjord's end, a fair played

00:11:19.598 --> 00:11:25.020
game, made quite a bit of money and earned his
favor. There you discussed what was to be done

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:30.234
with this new arrangement. He took some blood as
it was required of him to make sure that he

00:11:30.234 --> 00:11:30.854
could ensure--

00:11:30.854 --> 00:11:31.419
LAURA: Wait, what?!

00:11:32.444 --> 00:11:33.277
MATT: Yeah.

00:11:33.277 --> 00:11:34.084
LAURA: Just kidding, I was watching.

00:11:34.084 --> 00:11:41.760
MATT: You were watching. You guys said that you
were possibly looking for furthering some sort of

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:45.933
relationship for business purposes, but for now
you had an individual who needed to be smuggled

00:11:45.933 --> 00:11:51.487
out. He said it would be fine, but one favor
requires one in return and to prove yourself both

00:11:51.487 --> 00:11:58.056
capable and he had heard some tales of which you
had done within Zadash. He requested that you go

00:11:58.056 --> 00:12:04.575
and inspect this newly discovered buried ruin,
this series of chambers that exists on the

00:12:04.575 --> 00:12:11.480
outskirts of their underground river escape
towards Berleben and the Ounterloch. You went

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:20.459
ahead and retrieved Horris, brought him back. He
was then, supposedly it seems to be so, sent off

00:12:20.459 --> 00:12:22.949
and escorted out of the city, safely--

00:12:22.949 --> 00:12:24.165
LAURA: (quietly) They killed him.

00:12:24.165 --> 00:12:27.026
MATT: They totally killed him. They probably
killed him.

00:12:27.026 --> 00:12:31.132
SAM: But these criminals promised us!

00:12:31.132 --> 00:12:40.759
MATT: (laughs) You found yourself down towards the
subterranean docks to this river. By the way,

00:12:40.759 --> 00:12:46.539
through all of this Molly was having a mild panic
attack about his story, encountering Cree and

00:12:46.539 --> 00:12:49.469
apparently being called the name Lucien and
Nonagon.

00:12:49.469 --> 00:12:50.713
LAURA: Nonagon.

00:12:50.713 --> 00:12:59.180
MATT: Upon making your way to the docks, you were
given two boats and utilizing them to move further

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:05.782
downstream towards where the exterior of this ruin
was discovered. You all gathered your supplies and

00:13:05.782 --> 00:13:11.883
by the glowing orbs of Caleb's Dancing Lights
ahead of you, we left off with you traversing

00:13:11.883 --> 00:13:15.223
deeper and deeper down the dark tunnel and river.

00:13:15.223 --> 00:13:18.616
SAM: Do we remember which boat we were on?

00:13:18.616 --> 00:13:21.481
LAURA: I remember that Fjord asked me to be in his
boat.

00:13:21.481 --> 00:13:22.703
TRAVIS: Don't read into it.

00:13:22.703 --> 00:13:25.515
ASHLEY: I was with Caleb and Nott.

00:13:25.515 --> 00:13:30.589
MATT: Usually I do this just before the game and I
totally forgot to.

00:13:30.589 --> 00:13:33.640
SAM: That's okay! We can just do it now while
people are watching you.

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:37.573
MATT: That's what I'm here for. That's okay.

00:13:37.573 --> 00:13:38.942
LIAM: It's like a real game!

00:13:38.942 --> 00:13:40.653
TRAVIS: Yeah, the boats were--

00:13:40.653 --> 00:13:43.099
LIAM: Yasha, Caleb, Nott?

00:13:43.099 --> 00:13:43.697
LAURA: Yeah.

00:13:43.697 --> 00:13:45.537
MARISHA: And Beau, Jester, Fjord.

00:13:45.537 --> 00:13:46.787
SAM: Great! Done.

00:13:46.787 --> 00:13:50.263
LAURA: Nonagon! (singing) Na na na-na.

00:13:50.263 --> 00:13:51.783
TALIESIN: It's going to be in there, isn't it?

00:13:51.783 --> 00:14:01.901
MATT: So Yasha, Caleb, Nott, and the other ship
was Fjord, Jester, Beau, and Molly?

00:14:01.901 --> 00:14:02.657
LAURA: Yeah.

00:14:02.657 --> 00:14:04.604
TALIESIN: Everybody have their stuff together?

00:14:04.604 --> 00:14:07.953
TRAVIS: Oh, gosh. Our ship is way better than you
guys'.

00:14:07.953 --> 00:14:09.461
LAURA: Our ship is so colorful.

00:14:09.461 --> 00:14:10.089
LIAM: Dinghy battle!

00:14:10.089 --> 00:14:12.870
MARISHA: (laughs) Whack!

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:22.330
MATT: Heading down the tunnel, the two boats, the
width of it is just enough to fit both of you and

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:28.723
occasionally you have to pick one or the other as
it begins to pinch a bit and then expand. I will

00:14:28.723 --> 00:14:37.027
say due to weight, unless somebody wants to
actively paddle, the boat with Caleb, Yasha, and

00:14:37.027 --> 00:14:39.881
Nott will probably be taking the lead in those
moments.

00:14:39.881 --> 00:14:41.234
SAM: Yeah!

00:14:41.882 --> 00:14:47.960
LAURA: Although, I think probably, Fjord, I should
be the one paddling the boat because I'm a bit

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:48.964
stronger than you.

00:14:48.964 --> 00:14:50.615
TRAVIS: Well, that's why you're on the boat.

00:14:50.615 --> 00:14:51.149
LAURA: Okay.

00:14:51.149 --> 00:14:53.147
TRAVIS: Yeah, did you think it was for another
reason?

00:14:53.147 --> 00:14:54.562
LAURA: No, I just-- no!

00:14:54.562 --> 00:14:58.956
LIAM: Yeah, Yasha, are you paddling?

00:14:58.956 --> 00:14:59.855
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:14:59.855 --> 00:15:02.717
LIAM: Yeah, so we would be at the front of the
boat going--

00:15:02.717 --> 00:15:06.242
TALIESIN: The back of the boat would actually be
up a bit.

00:15:06.242 --> 00:15:07.795
TRAVIS: Bow up!

00:15:07.795 --> 00:15:19.584
MATT: Each couple of splashing sounds that hit as
the oars hit the water and the occasional crack of

00:15:19.584 --> 00:15:22.877
the water against the brook or a rock in the
center, you being to maneuver your way through

00:15:22.877 --> 00:15:27.344
this dark tunnel with just the low light that
you've been applying. It gets colder and colder

00:15:27.344 --> 00:15:32.335
the further down the tunnel you go and while it is
moist, you begin to see your breath just in

00:15:32.335 --> 00:15:34.339
general this low in the ground.

00:15:34.339 --> 00:15:34.707
LIAM: Terrible.

00:15:34.707 --> 00:15:35.772
SAM: Jesus, Laura.

00:15:35.772 --> 00:15:38.159
TRAVIS: Literally 12.

00:15:38.159 --> 00:15:39.648
LAURA: I'm glad I'm back.

00:15:39.648 --> 00:15:47.553
MATT: We are too, Laura. We are, too. It would
take about a mile journey to get to where they

00:15:47.553 --> 00:15:50.938
said this would be, so you have a few minutes. Is
there anything you guys wish to do, prepare?

00:15:50.938 --> 00:15:53.389
LAURA: Oh gosh!

00:15:53.389 --> 00:15:56.112
SAM: Prepare? Oh.

00:15:56.112 --> 00:15:58.296
TALIESIN: You've got your holy oil, right?

00:15:58.296 --> 00:15:59.167
SAM: Me?

00:15:59.167 --> 00:16:02.453
LAURA: Are we going to fight undead things? What
is going on?

00:16:02.453 --> 00:16:04.344
MATT: You have time, you're traveling!

00:16:04.344 --> 00:16:07.258
SAM: I forgot. Did you give me holy oil?

00:16:07.258 --> 00:16:09.736
TALIESIN: I believe or was it--

00:16:09.736 --> 00:16:11.565
MARISHA: You gave me holy oil and you holy oil.

00:16:11.565 --> 00:16:13.510
MATT: Holy water, not holy oil.

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:18.777
SAM: I have it, apparently. Well, what am I
supposed to do with it?

00:16:18.777 --> 00:16:22.197
TALIESIN: You throw it at something that looks
evil. It's pretty simple.

00:16:22.197 --> 00:16:25.548
SAM: Should I dip my bolts into it?

00:16:25.548 --> 00:16:27.271
TALIESIN: It doesn't work that way, sadly. It's
not--

00:16:27.271 --> 00:16:29.413
MARISHA: It's a like a splash grenade.

00:16:29.413 --> 00:16:31.380
TALIESIN: Water balloon with glass.

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:32.198
SAM: Okay.

00:16:32.198 --> 00:16:34.503
TRAVIS: How's the light in here, by the way?

00:16:34.503 --> 00:16:38.284
MATT: The only light you have is the light from
Caleb's Dancing Lights which he's re-upping as

00:16:38.284 --> 00:16:41.710
soon as it completes its one minute cycle each
time.

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:42.657
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:16:42.657 --> 00:16:45.900
LAURA: This is just like that scene in Tusk Love.

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:47.673
SAM: Which scene?

00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:57.058
LAURA: The scene where the ship is sinking and
Oskar and Genevieve have to paddle to shore!

00:16:57.058 --> 00:16:58.261
MARISHA: It was Guinevere.

00:16:58.261 --> 00:17:04.128
LAURA: Guinevere! That's was it was. I remember
Oskar a little more. Only Oskar was paddling in

00:17:04.128 --> 00:17:04.617
that one.

00:17:04.617 --> 00:17:07.005
LIAM: It is sad when ships sink.

00:17:07.005 --> 00:17:08.191
LAURA: It is.

00:17:08.191 --> 00:17:12.826
MARISHA: Where do you-- why?

00:17:12.826 --> 00:17:15.190
LIAM: I don't know.

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:21.001
(laughter)

00:17:21.001 --> 00:17:22.809
MATT: So you guys continue--

00:17:22.809 --> 00:17:25.523
LIAM: (Pigeon cooing)

00:17:25.523 --> 00:17:33.102
MATT: --continue down the river for a short time.
The river splits up for a bit and actually divides

00:17:33.102 --> 00:17:34.947
into two tunnels.

00:17:34.947 --> 00:17:36.433
SAM: Where are we going?

00:17:36.433 --> 00:17:39.094
LAURA: Should one of us go in one and one of us go
in the other?

00:17:39.094 --> 00:17:41.721
LIAM: That seems not like a good idea.

00:17:41.721 --> 00:17:48.584
SAM: I know something about sailing! The right one
is the bow and the left one is the stern.

00:17:48.584 --> 00:17:51.195
LAURA: Should we go in the bow or the stern?

00:17:51.195 --> 00:17:56.019
TRAVIS: Is there water running to the left or the
right? Does it look like it picks up current on

00:17:56.019 --> 00:17:56.688
either side?

00:17:56.688 --> 00:18:00.064
MATT: Make a perception check with disadvantage
because of the low light.

00:18:00.064 --> 00:18:06.873
TRAVIS: Oh, that's a fucking two. That's four.
Yeah.

00:18:06.873 --> 00:18:10.187
MATT: Hard to tell at this distance and it's
coming up quickly.

00:18:10.187 --> 00:18:12.461
LAURA: Can we feel more wind coming from either
side?

00:18:12.461 --> 00:18:14.358
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:18:14.358 --> 00:18:15.854
SAM and LAURA: Wind.

00:18:15.854 --> 00:18:16.418
TRAVIS: Water!

00:18:16.418 --> 00:18:18.243
MARISHA: Heart!

00:18:21.463 --> 00:18:22.246
LAURA: 21!

00:18:22.246 --> 00:18:26.683
MATT: 21? It does not appear that the wind is
picking up one way or the other, but it's

00:18:26.683 --> 00:18:28.083
approaching very quickly.

00:18:28.083 --> 00:18:34.335
TALIESIN: Is the general feeling of supernatural
unease coming from either of the-- or any signs

00:18:34.335 --> 00:18:41.731
of--? I know that we're going to be facing
probably some will-o'-wisps or something like that.

00:18:41.731 --> 00:18:43.877
LAURA: You should row backwards too, Yasha.

00:18:44.207 --> 00:18:48.130
MATT: I mean, the general sense of ominous dark,
future tunnel, but there's nothing supernatural

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:50.380
about the darkness ahead of you.

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:51.648
TRAVIS: Anyone have a preference?

00:18:51.648 --> 00:18:53.204
TALIESIN: Any sound coming from either of them?

00:18:53.204 --> 00:18:57.460
MARISHA: Do I notice any textures on any walls?
They talked about the north side of the wall being

00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:00.061
more textured and having a pattern.

00:19:00.061 --> 00:19:06.803
MATT: That being what gave them the idea that
that's where this is. That's where the entrance to

00:19:06.803 --> 00:19:07.186
this--

00:19:07.186 --> 00:19:08.283
TRAVIS: We're heading east right?

00:19:08.283 --> 00:19:10.568
MATT: You guys are heading east, yeah, a northeast
path.

00:19:10.568 --> 00:19:15.469
SAM: Well, we're in the lead boat and Yasha's
paddling, so Yasha, it's up to you!

00:19:15.469 --> 00:19:17.500
ASHLEY: I'm rowing back.

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:18.627
LAURA: I think left.

00:19:18.627 --> 00:19:19.879
MARISHA: Try the north side.

00:19:19.879 --> 00:19:25.746
ASHLEY: I go right. No, I'm just kidding! I'll go
to the left.

00:19:25.746 --> 00:19:31.907
MATT: So as you're paddling backwards, Yasha
adjusts the oar and changes the trajectory of the

00:19:31.907 --> 00:19:35.287
boat and heads it toward the left path. Do you
follow suit?

00:19:35.287 --> 00:19:36.779
LAURA: Should I follow them?

00:19:36.779 --> 00:19:37.750
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think that's a good idea.

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:38.391
LAURA: Okay.

00:19:38.391 --> 00:19:40.383
SAM: Good oar work!

00:19:40.383 --> 00:19:42.748
TRAVIS: It's like a steering wheel!

00:19:42.748 --> 00:19:45.291
LIAM: Nice, Carrot Top, nice.

00:19:45.291 --> 00:19:47.412
MARISHA: We're on a jet ski; this is great!

00:19:47.412 --> 00:19:54.644
MATT: Most spastic rowing partner ever. Heading
down the water path does pick up a little speed

00:19:54.644 --> 00:19:58.875
and seems to dip suddenly before picking up with a
mild splash but you catch yourself.

00:19:58.875 --> 00:20:00.821
MARISHA: (whispers) We're on Pirates of the
Caribbean!

00:20:00.821 --> 00:20:06.252
MATT: It slows down a little bit and you start
seeing a few rocks that break the surface and you

00:20:06.252 --> 00:20:09.579
have to maneuver around them. One you push off
with the oar to make sure that your boat doesn't

00:20:09.579 --> 00:20:15.211
strike it. You're not going fast enough to where
it would damage the actual boat, but it could list

00:20:15.211 --> 00:20:19.873
and get stuck on it if you were to not be careful.
You push off, thankfully because you both have

00:20:19.873 --> 00:20:20.825
light sources here.

00:20:20.825 --> 00:20:25.293
LIAM: Yasha, can you use your oar to see how deep
we are? Does it touch bottom?

00:20:25.293 --> 00:20:30.437
MATT: Okay, it gets just to the very edge of the
oar before it touches bottom.

00:20:30.437 --> 00:20:32.151
SAM: How long are the oars?

00:20:32.151 --> 00:20:34.537
MATT: The oars are about five feet long.

00:20:34.537 --> 00:20:36.231
LAURA: So you'd be fucked.

00:20:37.461 --> 00:20:38.355
SAM: Thanks.

00:20:38.355 --> 00:20:39.691
TRAVIS: Can you swim? Can you swim, Nott?

00:20:40.064 --> 00:20:40.833
SAM: No! What?!

00:20:40.833 --> 00:20:42.802
ASHLEY: Well, you could get on my shoulders if
you--

00:20:42.802 --> 00:20:44.347
SAM: I'm not going to get in the water, don't
worry!

00:20:44.347 --> 00:20:46.895
MARISHA: Have you been practicing any of the
techniques that we tried out?

00:20:46.895 --> 00:20:50.865
SAM: Yeah, I've been practicing one technique!
It's called wearing this ring of water walking!

00:20:50.865 --> 00:20:54.282
(laughter)

00:20:54.282 --> 00:20:55.193
MARISHA: Sure, that's good!

00:20:55.193 --> 00:20:56.026
SAM: Tried and true!

00:20:56.026 --> 00:20:57.810
LIAM: Unfucked!

00:20:57.810 --> 00:21:02.083
TALIESIN: You could literally be walking along
side of the boat.

00:21:02.083 --> 00:21:04.603
SAM: Oh, that's a good idea! Can I ghost ride the
whip?

00:21:04.603 --> 00:21:08.770
LIAM: Excuse me, you could be stealthing ahead at
this moment.

00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:11.590
SAM: Oh! I'm going to gingerly--

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:12.840
TRAVIS: Oh my god, please.

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:14.301
SAM: Just ghost ride.

00:21:14.301 --> 00:21:15.346
TRAVIS: Barefoot ski.

00:21:15.346 --> 00:21:17.359
SAM: Barefoot it onto the water and see what
happens.

00:21:17.359 --> 00:21:23.468
MATT: On the water? Okay. As you reach over the
edge of the boat and slowly lower your tiny goblin

00:21:23.468 --> 00:21:29.479
feet across the surface, breaking the water (water
splashing).

00:21:29.479 --> 00:21:32.749
(cheering)

00:21:32.749 --> 00:21:36.511
MATT: Go ahead and make a general dexterity check
for me, please.

00:21:36.511 --> 00:21:40.671
SAM: Ooh, not good, but it's dexterity, so six?

00:21:41.291 --> 00:21:42.180
MATT: Okay.

00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:47.164
SAM: This is fun! Hand me a rope, I'll water ski!

00:21:47.164 --> 00:21:55.428
MATT: As you're so entranced by this, you glance
down just in time to see one of those stones

00:21:55.975 --> 00:21:59.853
that's protruding from the river seems to have
come out of nowhere. Before you have a minute to

00:21:59.853 --> 00:22:04.726
punch off, it hits you across the knee and bruises
the heck out of it. Your whole leg starts

00:22:04.726 --> 00:22:10.677
throbbing and you're like, "Ah!" So your skiing is
now (crashing splashes) underneath.

00:22:10.677 --> 00:22:14.205
SAM: All right, I'll try to pull myself back up?

00:22:14.457 --> 00:22:18.013
MATT: All right, it takes you a moment and Caleb,
you go and help get Nott up onto the boat, but as

00:22:18.013 --> 00:22:21.672
you do, a little water logged, the water splashed
over your face a bit.

00:22:21.672 --> 00:22:25.075
SAM: Jesus, that's an intense water ski.

00:22:25.075 --> 00:22:35.199
MATT: Because at that moment the lights go out. As
soon as you pull Nott up into the ship, there's a

00:22:35.199 --> 00:22:39.552
brief moment where Nott breathes and looks back up
with a smile about to say thank you before you

00:22:39.552 --> 00:22:45.806
see, out of the corner of your eye, one of the
stalagmites at the top of the ceiling detach,

00:22:45.806 --> 00:22:54.605
float down and open up, almost like an umbrella
before it lands and collapses on top of Nott.

00:22:54.605 --> 00:22:57.027
LAURA: (gasps) It's just like the rug!

00:22:57.027 --> 00:23:01.724
SAM: Ah! What happened? What's going on?

00:23:01.724 --> 00:23:06.114
MATT: With advantage because it was with a
surprise attack on that one, so that would be a 19

00:23:06.114 --> 00:23:07.174
to hit. What's your armor class?

00:23:07.174 --> 00:23:08.493
SAM: Of course that hits. Yes.

00:23:08.493 --> 00:23:13.895
MATT: All right, Nott. That is five points of
bludgeoning damage and it is attached to you. You

00:23:13.895 --> 00:23:24.988
now see a pitch black and gray spined octopus-type
creature, that looks from the exterior like any

00:23:24.988 --> 00:23:30.578
other part of the cavern wall, but has these deep
sunk red eyes at the top of its base and it's

00:23:30.578 --> 00:23:36.607
completely wrapped around the top of Nott, and is
currently crushing down on top of her. I need you

00:23:36.607 --> 00:23:37.777
all to roll initiative.

00:23:37.777 --> 00:23:39.303
LIAM: In the boat?

00:23:39.303 --> 00:23:42.288
LAURA: Oh my god!

00:23:42.288 --> 00:23:44.997
LIAM: I had these miniatures. I forget what
they're called.

00:23:44.997 --> 00:23:47.080
ASHLEY: Oh, that's terrible!

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:49.414
LIAM: I dropped my Colville meteorite!

00:23:49.414 --> 00:23:53.109
SAM: We're already in it? We just started!

00:23:53.109 --> 00:23:54.167
TRAVIS: That's the best!

00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:55.470
MARISHA: Oh, that's cool!

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:56.944
LIAM: Oh! I got a 20!

00:23:56.944 --> 00:24:00.036
MATT: It doesn't count if it's on the floor, dude.

00:24:00.036 --> 00:24:02.908
TRAVIS: There are limits!

00:24:02.908 --> 00:24:03.917
MATT: There are!

00:24:03.917 --> 00:24:04.931
LIAM: Oh, I got a one!

00:24:04.931 --> 00:24:07.375
SAM: Wait, we're rolling ones! That's $100!

00:24:07.375 --> 00:24:09.632
(cheering)

00:24:09.632 --> 00:24:11.312
LAURA: I rolled a one, too!

00:24:11.312 --> 00:24:12.704
(cheering)

00:24:12.704 --> 00:24:14.165
ASHLEY: That's $300?

00:24:14.165 --> 00:24:15.291
SAM: Two.

00:24:15.291 --> 00:24:16.702
ASHLEY: Wait, did you roll a one?

00:24:16.702 --> 00:24:17.609
SAM: No.

00:24:17.609 --> 00:24:18.613
ASHLEY: Oh, okay, sorry. I got excited.

00:24:18.613 --> 00:24:20.894
LIAM: The 20 would have been nice though.

00:24:20.894 --> 00:24:22.810
ASHLEY and TRAVIS: What is math?

00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:26.609
MATT: Molly, roughly where are you on this board?

00:24:26.609 --> 00:24:29.011
TALIESIN: I would assume I'm in the middle.

00:24:29.011 --> 00:24:31.079
MATT: All right. Fjord and Beau in that order?

00:24:31.079 --> 00:24:32.340
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's good.

00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:33.359
LIAM: That's so cool!

00:24:33.359 --> 00:24:34.710
ASHLEY: This is awesome!

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:37.783
LAURA: Oh, cool. I like the cat just like blah.

00:24:37.783 --> 00:24:48.165
MATT: You now see this entity has fallen and
latched on to Nott. So in that degree.

00:24:48.165 --> 00:24:51.205
SAM: Jesus.

00:24:51.205 --> 00:24:51.904
TRAVIS: Uh oh.

00:24:51.904 --> 00:24:54.942
MATT: All right, 25 to 20?

00:24:54.942 --> 00:24:57.141
TRAVIS: Nobody.

00:24:57.141 --> 00:24:58.942
MATT: 20 to 15?

00:24:58.942 --> 00:25:00.242
TRAVIS: 15.

00:25:00.242 --> 00:25:03.641
SAM: Wow. That's it? We suck.

00:25:03.641 --> 00:25:04.548
MARISHA: We did bad.

00:25:04.548 --> 00:25:05.853
LAURA: We rolled real bad.

00:25:05.853 --> 00:25:07.307
MATT: 15 to ten.

00:25:07.307 --> 00:25:08.191
MARISHA: Nine.

00:25:08.191 --> 00:25:09.644
MATT: Hold on, 15 to ten.

00:25:09.644 --> 00:25:17.083
SAM: Ten. Whoa. What? You guys are all single
digits? Oh boy!

00:25:18.243 --> 00:25:19.889
ASHLEY: I always roll shit initiative.

00:25:19.889 --> 00:25:21.501
SAM: You do. You really do.

00:25:21.501 --> 00:25:22.414
ASHLEY: I don't know what--

00:25:22.414 --> 00:25:23.483
MATT: Historically.

00:25:23.483 --> 00:25:24.297
ASHLEY: Yes.

00:25:25.487 --> 00:25:26.988
MATT: All right. Ten to five.

00:25:26.988 --> 00:25:27.922
MARISHA: Nine.

00:25:27.922 --> 00:25:29.090
MATT: Beau at nine.

00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:29.680
TALIESIN: Seven.

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:30.558
LAURA: Five.

00:25:30.708 --> 00:25:37.684
MATT: Wow! Molly, Jester. That's everybody,
right?

00:25:37.684 --> 00:25:39.197
ASHLEY: Four. I rolled four.

00:25:39.197 --> 00:25:40.216
MATT: And four.

00:25:40.216 --> 00:25:41.406
LIAM: <i>Und Ein.</i>

00:25:41.406 --> 00:25:42.936
LAURA: You don't have any initiative?

00:25:42.936 --> 00:25:45.182
LIAM: Oh, do I? Oh sure, two.

00:25:45.182 --> 00:25:48.015
LAURA: Okay, so you rolled a three. Good job.

00:25:48.015 --> 00:25:50.874
LIAM: No, no. Plus one, so now it's two.

00:25:50.874 --> 00:25:52.622
ASHLEY: What's a two in German?

00:25:52.622 --> 00:25:54.574
LIAM, TALIESIN, and LAURA: <i>Zwei.</i>

00:25:54.574 --> 00:25:56.553
SAM, TALIESIN, LAURA: <i>Eins, zwei, drei.</i>

00:25:56.553 --> 00:25:59.069
SAM: That's it. That's all the numbers in German.

00:25:59.069 --> 00:26:01.577
MATT: Caleb, you're holding up the rear?

00:26:01.577 --> 00:26:02.860
LIAM: <i>Ja.</i> Of course.

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:04.740
TRAVIS: Oh god, I'm first?

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:07.710
MATT: First and foremost, Fjord, you're up.

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:09.660
TRAVIS: Yeah, right, okay.

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:15.873
MATT: It has completely attached itself, and the
end of its tendrils coming to these pointed hook

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:23.520
protrusions, this thick flesh webbing between each
of these tentacles that form the umbrella-type

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:27.355
shape, have all engulfed most of Nott, and you
hear the muffled (muffled yelling) from within,

00:26:27.355 --> 00:26:31.172
and the little bit of the feet trying desperately
to hold onto the boat and maintain balance.

00:26:31.172 --> 00:26:35.807
TRAVIS: Jesus. Do I have a clear line of sight to
Nott and octopus fuck?

00:26:35.807 --> 00:26:36.441
MATT: You do.

00:26:36.441 --> 00:26:40.153
TRAVIS: Okay. I won't hit Caleb, right?

00:26:40.153 --> 00:26:44.186
MATT: Probably not. You know what you're doing.

00:26:44.186 --> 00:26:45.674
LAURA: It looks like no, I'm seeing your angle.

00:26:45.674 --> 00:26:47.718
LIAM: I'm pretty sturdy though, so I wouldn't
sweat it.

00:26:47.718 --> 00:26:53.820
TRAVIS: As I'm looking, is it Nott and then
octopus behind it, or is it enveloping him so I can't--

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:55.732
MATT: No, it's enveloped, and is currently wrapped
around.

00:26:55.732 --> 00:26:58.160
TRAVIS: All right. I'm going to send an Eldritch
Blast towards the octopus.

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:03.365
SAM, ASHLEY, and TALIESIN: (muffled yelling)

00:27:03.365 --> 00:27:04.086
SAM: Not again!

00:27:04.086 --> 00:27:07.003
LAURA: Oh, my glasses are in my car, shit.

00:27:07.003 --> 00:27:09.136
TRAVIS: That's a 21 to hit.

00:27:09.136 --> 00:27:10.252
MATT: That hits, go ahead and roll damage.

00:27:10.252 --> 00:27:17.564
TRAVIS: That is 1d10. That is eight points of
damage.

00:27:17.564 --> 00:27:22.898
MATT: Eight points of damage, nice. Does that end
your turn?

00:27:22.898 --> 00:27:23.415
TRAVIS: Yes.

00:27:23.415 --> 00:27:24.608
SAM: Do I take any of that?

00:27:24.608 --> 00:27:25.496
MATT: No, you do not.

00:27:25.496 --> 00:27:26.052
SAM: Oh!

00:27:26.052 --> 00:27:26.915
TALIESIN: That's nice.

00:27:26.915 --> 00:27:33.839
TRAVIS: Actually, with my bonus action, can I cast
Hex on umbrella fuck?

00:27:33.839 --> 00:27:39.724
MATT: You cannot, unfortunately, because-- Well,
no, because Eldritch Blast is a cantrip, so you can.

00:27:39.724 --> 00:27:40.632
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:27:40.632 --> 00:27:42.626
MATT: Yes you can.

00:27:42.626 --> 00:27:46.002
TRAVIS: Woo! That's 1d--

00:27:46.002 --> 00:27:47.504
MATT: Well, you would have had to have done that
first.

00:27:47.504 --> 00:27:48.963
TRAVIS: That's right. That's on the next thing,
right.

00:27:48.963 --> 00:27:50.911
MATT: Correct. But next time it gets hit by you,
you can add extra damage.

00:27:50.911 --> 00:27:51.436
TRAVIS: Copy that.

00:27:51.436 --> 00:27:52.377
MATT: Okay. That finishes your go.

00:27:52.377 --> 00:27:54.054
LAURA: Oh, it's like Hunter's Mark.

00:27:54.054 --> 00:28:04.346
MATT: Now it's their turn. Being attached to
there, the strange darkmantle-like beast--

00:28:04.346 --> 00:28:07.194
TRAVIS: Can it have disadvantage on strength
checks?

00:28:07.194 --> 00:28:08.355
MATT: It can, sure.

00:28:08.355 --> 00:28:10.402
TRAVIS: I never said that before. I got to
remember.

00:28:10.402 --> 00:28:13.093
MATT: Yep. There you go. strength checks it is.
All right.

00:28:13.093 --> 00:28:15.459
MARISHA: It's okay. It's not that big a deal.

00:28:15.459 --> 00:28:22.305
MATT: You watch as it begins to slowly crush
around Nott, instead its eyes flash red, and you

00:28:22.305 --> 00:28:31.434
watch as a familiar-looking orb of blackness
emanates from it, completely filling this space

00:28:31.434 --> 00:28:36.910
with darkness. So at the moment, everyone on that
boat is blind.

00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:42.061
ASHLEY: Wait, I don't think I can-- since I have
danger sense, can I be blinded?

00:28:42.061 --> 00:28:47.466
MATT: You can be blinded, but you have advantage
on dexterity saving throws against things that you see.

00:28:47.921 --> 00:28:48.530
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:50.257
LIAM: But do you see it?

00:28:50.257 --> 00:28:52.033
MARISHA: So it did like an ink cloud.

00:28:52.033 --> 00:28:58.821
MATT: Essentially, but a magical darkness that
radiates outside of it. Another one going towards

00:28:58.821 --> 00:29:04.266
the source of the beam of light that had emitted
and damaged its ally sweeps down towards Fjord and

00:29:04.266 --> 00:29:05.730
attempts to go ahead and wrap around.

00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:06.303
TRAVIS: Shit!

00:29:06.303 --> 00:29:09.750
MATT: That is going to be 21 to hit.

00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:10.866
TRAVIS: That definitely hit.

00:29:10.866 --> 00:29:14.710
MATT: You take five points of bludgeoning damage
as well--

00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:17.266
LAURA: Wait, another one came down on Fjord?

00:29:17.266 --> 00:29:18.586
MATT: And attaches itself to Fjord, yeah.

00:29:18.586 --> 00:29:19.687
LAURA: Oh, no.

00:29:19.687 --> 00:29:21.636
TRAVIS: (muffled yelling)

00:29:21.636 --> 00:29:24.068
LAURA: It's going to make us blind too, we got to
kill it quick.

00:29:24.068 --> 00:29:28.025
MATT: That brings us to Nott, you're up.

00:29:28.025 --> 00:29:35.339
SAM: Can I try to get out of the grapple? Is that
a thing that I can do?

00:29:35.339 --> 00:29:38.541
MATT: You can attempt to. You have to make a
strength check to do so.

00:29:38.541 --> 00:29:45.253
SAM: All right. I will push with all my little
might against the creepy-- Ooh! Just a strength check?

00:29:45.503 --> 00:29:48.626
MATT: Yes, a strength check.

00:29:48.626 --> 00:29:49.381
SAM: 18!

00:29:49.381 --> 00:29:53.778
MATT: Yeah, that'll do it. So you manage to break
free from its grasp.

00:29:53.778 --> 00:29:56.792
SAM: (yell) That's my action.

00:29:56.792 --> 00:29:57.368
MATT: Yep.

00:29:57.368 --> 00:29:59.332
SAM: I can't see it.

00:29:59.332 --> 00:30:04.443
MATT: Nope, it is just darkness. You push it off
of you, and you still have nothing before you. You

00:30:04.719 --> 00:30:07.405
didn't see the darkness emit from it, you've just
thrown it off and you're still blind. It's a

00:30:07.405 --> 00:30:09.033
little off putting to you at the moment.

00:30:09.033 --> 00:30:15.723
SAM: Okay, I'll spend the rest of my turn trying
to figure out if that was caused by just touching

00:30:15.723 --> 00:30:19.637
the water. Because I'm not sure what happened.

00:30:19.637 --> 00:30:24.346
MATT: Okay, you throw the creature off, whatever
is on you, and it's just darkness around you. You

00:30:24.346 --> 00:30:27.323
start reaching out for some sort of sign of
something in your vicinity.

00:30:27.323 --> 00:30:27.861
SAM: Sure.

00:30:27.861 --> 00:30:29.164
MATT: Are you holding an action?

00:30:29.164 --> 00:30:30.321
SAM: I used my action to--

00:30:30.321 --> 00:30:33.760
MATT: No, that's right. That's your turn. That
brings us to Beau.

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:40.609
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to go (mild screaming)
and do a straight whack on it. Sorry Fjord, it's

00:30:40.609 --> 00:30:47.700
on you! Ooh, that's a natural 19. 25.

00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:49.287
MATT: 25 hits, roll damage.

00:30:49.287 --> 00:30:53.289
SAM: We'll remember where they are. It's fine,
just leave them.

00:30:53.289 --> 00:30:59.171
MARISHA: What is it? 1d-- that's not great, six
damage.

00:30:59.171 --> 00:31:06.428
MATT: Six point of damage to that one, all right.
It's glomped onto Fjord's head, the rest of it

00:31:06.428 --> 00:31:12.044
pulling and wrapping into the insides of his
armor. You hit it just above where-- you feel the

00:31:12.044 --> 00:31:18.141
impact, Fjord, but it's mostly absorbed by the
strange, rubbery, flesh exterior of this creature.

00:31:18.141 --> 00:31:18.854
TRAVIS: Ow.

00:31:18.854 --> 00:31:19.899
MARISHA: Did I hurt you?

00:31:19.899 --> 00:31:20.567
TRAVIS: No.

00:31:20.567 --> 00:31:25.722
MARISHA: Okay! (whack) I deck him right across the
face. Yeah, I'll take that, 16.

00:31:25.722 --> 00:31:27.026
MATT: That'll hit, roll damage.

00:31:27.026 --> 00:31:27.767
MARISHA: Okay.

00:31:27.767 --> 00:31:30.603
TRAVIS: It's like getting punched with a
motorcycle helmet on.

00:31:30.603 --> 00:31:33.653
MARISHA: Seven damage.

00:31:33.653 --> 00:31:40.180
MATT: Nice. You clock both this creature and Fjord
across the chin. No damage to you, Fjord, but you

00:31:40.561 --> 00:31:43.356
are a bit dizzy from the impact in the darkness
around your face.

00:31:43.356 --> 00:31:44.502
TRAVIS: (strained) I feel like that was personal.

00:31:44.502 --> 00:31:47.570
MARISHA: Ah, one more. I'm going to do flurry of
blows.

00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:49.352
SAM: Oh boy.

00:31:49.352 --> 00:31:53.258
TRAVIS: (impacts)

00:31:53.258 --> 00:31:54.357
MATT: Essentially.

00:31:54.357 --> 00:32:00.903
MARISHA: That's a natural 17. That's a four, eight
damage.

00:32:00.903 --> 00:32:02.536
MATT: Eight damage, nice.

00:32:02.536 --> 00:32:04.192
TRAVIS: Sick, good turn.

00:32:04.192 --> 00:32:07.324
LIAM: We are level four. Eight damage, sick.

00:32:07.324 --> 00:32:15.398
MATT: After you deck the darkmantle across the
face and Fjord, you backhand with a full back fist

00:32:15.398 --> 00:32:21.769
blow to the side. You see it almost detach, and
it's looking like it's scrambling to hold on. That

00:32:21.769 --> 00:32:22.596
finishes your turn?

00:32:22.596 --> 00:32:23.140
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:24.748
TRAVIS: I am definitely woozy.

00:32:24.748 --> 00:32:26.231
MARISHA: Sorry.

00:32:26.231 --> 00:32:27.762
MATT: That brings us to Molly.

00:32:27.762 --> 00:32:32.373
TALIESIN: I'm going to take out my swords, and
just I'm going to try and cleave some of these

00:32:32.373 --> 00:32:37.587
tentacles off. See if I can start to get it to
lose its grip. I'm going to take my first shot.

00:32:37.587 --> 00:32:40.199
I'm going to stop saying that. That's a 23 to
hit.

00:32:40.199 --> 00:32:41.866
MATT: That hits. Roll damage.

00:32:41.866 --> 00:32:42.554
SAM: (gunshot)

00:32:42.554 --> 00:32:47.227
TALIESIN: Thank you. Nine points of damage.

00:32:47.227 --> 00:32:54.279
MATT: As you take the blade and swing, you cut
down pretty close to where Fjord's head is. As you

00:32:54.279 --> 00:32:59.694
cleave through the body actually splits, revealing
Fjord's face. As it limply falls off into the

00:32:59.694 --> 00:33:01.363
water slinking into the sludge.

00:33:01.363 --> 00:33:02.687
LAURA: It looks like he was being born.

00:33:02.687 --> 00:33:03.149
TRAVIS: Thanks.

00:33:03.149 --> 00:33:08.312
TALIESIN: Welcome! We probably should head towards
the other one.

00:33:08.312 --> 00:33:10.295
MATT: That ends your turn, Molly?

00:33:10.295 --> 00:33:11.371
TALIESIN: That ends my turn.

00:33:11.371 --> 00:33:13.091
MATT: All righty, that brings us to Jester.

00:33:13.091 --> 00:33:18.694
LAURA: I can't see anything on the other side.

00:33:18.694 --> 00:33:20.158
MATT: No, you can just see darkness.

00:33:20.158 --> 00:33:21.908
TALIESIN: But we can boat in there.

00:33:21.908 --> 00:33:25.372
LAURA: Yeah, I mean I will move the boat closer
up.

00:33:25.372 --> 00:33:27.615
MATT: Make a strength check.

00:33:31.465 --> 00:33:35.005
LAURA: Oh, that was terrible, six.

00:33:35.005 --> 00:33:40.117
MATT: Six, okay. You struggle, it doesn't seem to
get purchase. You're confused by this.

00:33:40.117 --> 00:33:42.012
LAURA: I can't move the boat, y'all.

00:33:42.012 --> 00:33:45.800
MATT: Well, it's a lot going on in the moment and
you're trying to figure out what to do. You don't

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:50.499
quite have the gumption to get it catching up
relatively fast. So it goes just five feet.

00:33:50.499 --> 00:33:54.692
LAURA: Okay. Does that count as an action or a
movement?

00:33:55.104 --> 00:33:56.327
MATT: That would be your action on that one.

00:33:56.327 --> 00:33:57.142
LAURA: Cool.

00:33:57.142 --> 00:34:00.636
SAM: Welcome back, Laura.

00:34:00.636 --> 00:34:06.415
LAURA: Thanks. This is fun, guys. All right, then
I'm going to save--

00:34:06.415 --> 00:34:07.437
LIAM: Mistress of the Hunt.

00:34:07.437 --> 00:34:15.424
LAURA: Yeah. That's what I got, I guess. Yeah.
Sweet.

00:34:15.424 --> 00:34:19.813
MATT: That ends Jester's turn. Yasha, you're up.

00:34:19.813 --> 00:34:25.018
ASHLEY: Okay, well, I guess I wouldn't know this.
His went into the water?

00:34:25.018 --> 00:34:28.306
MATT: Well no, you have no idea.

00:34:28.306 --> 00:34:29.688
LAURA: Did you hear a splash?

00:34:29.688 --> 00:34:33.540
MATT: You watched as it slip around Nott and
darkness envelop it, and that's all you know.

00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:34.626
TRAVIS: You heard a (yelp) (impact).

00:34:34.626 --> 00:34:37.139
MATT: You know the general direction of where it
is.

00:34:37.148 --> 00:34:48.961
ASHLEY: Okay, can I use the Light cantrip and see if I
can make some light in the darkness? Or wait.

00:34:48.961 --> 00:34:53.251
Because I'm a Light Bearer.

00:34:53.251 --> 00:34:59.879
MATT: You are. You spend your action to create the
Light cantrip. You watch as it flickers for a

00:34:59.879 --> 00:35:04.094
second and the darkness consumes the light. The
spell has no effect.

00:35:04.094 --> 00:35:09.453
ASHLEY: Okay, I don't know if I can still do this
as a bonus action. Can I try to slowly move us a

00:35:09.453 --> 00:35:10.642
little forward?

00:35:10.642 --> 00:35:15.327
MATT: Yeah, if you want to. Well, that's an action
to do that, technically, so you couldn't. You used

00:35:15.327 --> 00:35:16.851
your action to do the Light cantrip,
unfortunately.

00:35:16.851 --> 00:35:18.721
ASHLEY: Okay. Yeah, okay.

00:35:18.721 --> 00:35:19.885
MATT: So that's your turn?

00:35:19.885 --> 00:35:20.676
ASHLEY: Yeah that's my turn.

00:35:20.676 --> 00:35:21.683
MATT: Okay, Caleb you're up.

00:35:21.683 --> 00:35:28.060
LIAM: I went from being able to see almost nothing
to seeing nothing. I heard Nott get scholpped in

00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:34.071
and then I heard some cry. So I raise up the glove
of blasting and I'm going to fire at where I think

00:35:34.071 --> 00:35:35.101
this thing is.

00:35:35.101 --> 00:35:35.630
LAURA: Oh no.

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:36.355
SAM: I'm dead.

00:35:36.355 --> 00:35:38.033
MATT: That's Scorching Ray for that?

00:35:38.033 --> 00:35:38.386
LIAM: Yeah.

00:35:38.386 --> 00:35:39.439
MATT: Three attacks.

00:35:39.439 --> 00:35:40.438
LIAM: Three strikes at disadvantage.

00:35:40.438 --> 00:35:41.716
MATT: All at disadvantage because you're blind.

00:35:41.716 --> 00:35:48.885
LIAM: That's correct. Okay, good. For the first is
16.

00:35:48.885 --> 00:35:49.577
MATT: 16 hits.

00:35:49.577 --> 00:35:56.971
LIAM: Yeah, let me do them all. 11.

00:35:56.971 --> 00:35:58.534
MATT: 11 just hits.

00:35:58.534 --> 00:36:03.647
LIAM: <i>Und</i> 15.

00:36:03.647 --> 00:36:06.727
MATT: All three hit, actually, even blinded.

00:36:06.727 --> 00:36:15.275
LIAM: (frantic noises) Plus that is ten. The total
is 13.

00:36:15.275 --> 00:36:26.675
MATT: 13 points of damage. All together, right?
Nope. It loses concentration on its darkness.

00:36:26.675 --> 00:36:29.027
(cheering)

00:36:29.027 --> 00:36:32.008
MATT: But is still standing. You watch as the
darkness flickers out of the way. There's flames

00:36:32.008 --> 00:36:35.796
burning around the outside and three giant singe
marks on the outside of its rubbery skin. It's

00:36:35.796 --> 00:36:41.431
floating in the air there for a second before it's
going back in for a swoop against the one who

00:36:41.431 --> 00:36:42.508
recently singed it.

00:36:42.508 --> 00:36:46.607
LIAM: Okay, before it hits me, I'll say I sit down
on the bench and just go (whimper).

00:36:47.253 --> 00:36:51.695
MATT: All right, that ends your turn, top of the
round. The boats continue further downstream.

00:36:51.695 --> 00:36:54.084
TALIESIN: What are those things on the side?

00:36:54.084 --> 00:36:54.536
LAURA: Oh.

00:36:54.536 --> 00:36:56.001
SAM: Those are just rocks.

00:36:56.001 --> 00:36:57.486
LAURA: That's not a rock.

00:36:57.486 --> 00:36:58.694
SAM: It's fine. It's rocks.

00:36:58.694 --> 00:37:01.503
MATT: Top of the round, Fjord, it's you.

00:37:01.503 --> 00:37:03.812
TRAVIS: I'm going to cast Armor of Agathys on
myself.

00:37:03.812 --> 00:37:09.000
MATT: You watch as the moisture from the air and
some of the water droplets from the river, from

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.680
the splashing of the boat suddenly stick up and
congeal in ice form around the outside of Fjord's body.

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:16.388
TRAVIS: Hex is still maintained on that bastard,
right?

00:37:16.388 --> 00:37:16.855
MATT: Correct.

00:37:16.855 --> 00:37:24.367
TRAVIS: So I can roll 1d6. Or do I, for the-- I
cast Hex on the one that was on Nott.

00:37:24.367 --> 00:37:26.272
MATT: It only takes the 1d6 damage when you damage
it.

00:37:26.272 --> 00:37:27.329
TRAVIS: Oh shit, right.

00:37:27.329 --> 00:37:36.282
MATT: That ends Fjord's turn. Another one swoops
down and is going to attempt to envelope the one

00:37:36.282 --> 00:37:37.381
that scorched its ally.

00:37:37.381 --> 00:37:38.789
LIAM: I am a monk, it's fine.

00:37:38.789 --> 00:37:42.030
MATT: That's going to be a 14 to hit.

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:43.914
LIAM: Yeah, of course it hits.

00:37:43.914 --> 00:37:49.686
MATT: You take nine points of bludgeoning damage
and it is attached to you.

00:37:49.686 --> 00:37:51.192
LIAM: Yeah that's <i>wunderbar</i>.

00:37:51.192 --> 00:37:56.814
MATT: The one that is still existing is going to
attempt to attach to you once again, Nott.

00:37:56.814 --> 00:37:57.282
SAM: No!

00:37:57.282 --> 00:38:01.669
MATT: That's going to be a 12 to hit.

00:38:01.669 --> 00:38:02.386
SAM: Does not.

00:38:02.386 --> 00:38:03.188
MATT: That is a miss.

00:38:03.188 --> 00:38:04.970
LAURA and SAM: Yay.

00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:08.609
LAURA: Things are looking up, you guys.

00:38:08.609 --> 00:38:11.733
MATT: That ends their go. Nott, you're up.

00:38:11.733 --> 00:38:18.206
SAM: I will, seeing the one on Caleb, spin around
and fire my hand crossbow at that one.

00:38:18.557 --> 00:38:21.993
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make an attack with
disadvantage, because you are in melee with

00:38:21.993 --> 00:38:26.538
another creature. The other creature that tried to
grapple you is right up against you. So it is

00:38:26.538 --> 00:38:28.283
still harrying you when you're trying to fire.

00:38:28.283 --> 00:38:28.889
SAM: Disadvantage.

00:38:28.889 --> 00:38:30.795
LIAM: Does she get sneak attack since I'm adjacent
to that?

00:38:30.795 --> 00:38:31.846
MATT: Yeah, if she hits.

00:38:31.846 --> 00:38:34.808
SAM: It was going to be good, ten.

00:38:34.808 --> 00:38:39.744
MATT: Ten does not hit, unfortunately. You attempt
to fire and at the last minute it shifts out of

00:38:39.744 --> 00:38:44.186
the way. You can see Caleb's chest exposed to
where you were aiming, and you pull back and fire

00:38:44.186 --> 00:38:46.339
wide off into the darkness.

00:38:46.339 --> 00:38:53.014
SAM: Then I'll turn again and shoot with my bonus
action at the one that I'm engaged with.

00:38:53.014 --> 00:38:53.633
MATT All righty.

00:38:53.633 --> 00:38:56.837
SAM: Disadvantage, right?

00:38:56.837 --> 00:38:57.445
MATT: Yes.

00:38:57.445 --> 00:38:58.711
SAM: So 20 to hit.

00:38:58.711 --> 00:39:01.509
MATT: 20 does hit. You don't get sneak attack,
however, because this guy is not engaged with

00:39:01.509 --> 00:39:02.984
anyone else. Go ahead and roll damage.

00:39:02.984 --> 00:39:12.381
SAM: I will still say: Get off of my boat. I cause
two points of damage. Oh wait, no! Six points of damage.

00:39:12.381 --> 00:39:17.077
LIAM: One question, is Frumpkin by the thing?
Because Frumpkin is an ally.

00:39:17.077 --> 00:39:19.372
MATT: I don't know if Frumpkin--

00:39:19.372 --> 00:39:23.210
LIAM: I know that I have read that Frumpkin can
help me give me advantage.

00:39:23.210 --> 00:39:24.863
SAM: But he is not engaged, is he?

00:39:24.863 --> 00:39:27.280
LIAM: Whatever you want.

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:30.628
MATT: I'd say for now, given the fact that
Frumpkin is in a small boat and the creature is

00:39:30.949 --> 00:39:33.621
flying up, I would not consider it harrying the
entity enough to grant sneak attack. But it

00:39:33.621 --> 00:39:37.676
doesn't matter. Because that was enough to finish
it off. It had already been damaged quite a bit in

00:39:37.676 --> 00:39:43.348
the previous round. So as you fire your final
crossbolt into that one it (impact) (splash) into

00:39:43.348 --> 00:39:47.650
the river below. You watch as it sink below the
water as your boat begins to scoot by (scraping

00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:50.600
noise) and begins grinding against this center
stone here in the middle of the river. It's just

00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:55.290
barely making its way around. Finishing that,
that's the end of Nott's turn, Beau you're up.

00:39:55.290 --> 00:39:59.464
MARISHA: Okay, is the one still next to me? That
was attacking Fjord.

00:39:59.464 --> 00:40:01.271
MATT: No, that one has been slaughtered. There is
one on Caleb over there.

00:40:01.271 --> 00:40:06.049
MARISHA: Oh, there's one on Caleb. He's still on
top of him?

00:40:06.049 --> 00:40:07.667
MATT: It is currently attached to him around his
head, yeah.

00:40:07.667 --> 00:40:09.475
MARISHA: I'm probably not within five feet.

00:40:09.475 --> 00:40:11.718
MATT: Nope. There's probably about a ten foot
distance between you and the other boat.

00:40:11.718 --> 00:40:12.209
LAURA: Leap for it!

00:40:12.209 --> 00:40:15.311
MARISHA: Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I'm going
to do some cool monk shit! I'm going to--

00:40:15.311 --> 00:40:16.754
SAM: Why do I get disadvantage?

00:40:16.754 --> 00:40:19.151
LAURA: Because it's a ranged attack.

00:40:19.151 --> 00:40:24.241
SAM: Yeah, but I ignore all disadvantage with my
Crossbow Expert feat.

00:40:24.241 --> 00:40:26.621
MATT: Oh that's right, because you got a feat for
it.

00:40:26.621 --> 00:40:27.287
SAM: Yeah.

00:40:27.287 --> 00:40:28.403
MATT: So you would not have disadvantage on that.

00:40:28.403 --> 00:40:29.292
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:40:29.292 --> 00:40:30.322
SAM: Well, next time.

00:40:30.322 --> 00:40:32.415
MATT: Well, we'll let you roll damage for Caleb's
because it did work.

00:40:32.415 --> 00:40:33.618
SAM: That's going to be a lot of damage.

00:40:33.618 --> 00:40:35.178
MATT: I forgot that you had gotten that feat. Go
for it.

00:40:35.178 --> 00:40:37.348
SAM: Wait, I don't even remember what I rolled.

00:40:37.348 --> 00:40:40.465
MATT: The first one was high the second one was
low.

00:40:40.465 --> 00:40:47.206
SAM: All right. That's a lot. It's 20 points of
damage.

00:40:47.206 --> 00:40:49.189
LIAM: I would say leave me in that motherfucker.

00:40:49.189 --> 00:40:51.618
TALIESIN: That was an intense roll right now.

00:40:51.618 --> 00:40:54.654
SAM: It's okay, I don't need it.

00:40:54.654 --> 00:41:01.700
MATT: So with that one moment as Beau's preparing,
you manage one blast of the crossbow that strikes

00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:07.367
square into one of the eyes of the creature. You
hear this this strange guttural pain sound as it's

00:41:07.367 --> 00:41:12.263
still holding onto Caleb, but seems to have taken
a big hit. On your turn, Beau?

00:41:12.263 --> 00:41:20.435
MARISHA: (confused battle cry) Continuing on, I'm
going to leap across and see if I can do a jump

00:41:20.435 --> 00:41:23.042
and a slap with the staff on top.

00:41:23.042 --> 00:41:27.680
MATT: For the purposes of this, roll an acrobatics
check. This is a more parkour off of the boat

00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:28.341
using the weight.

00:41:28.341 --> 00:41:29.180
LIAM: This is your jam.

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:29.967
MARISHA: Parkour.

00:41:29.967 --> 00:41:31.353
TRAVIS: The boat goes (bobbing in water).

00:41:31.353 --> 00:41:32.726
LIAM: Get it, Altaïr.

00:41:32.726 --> 00:41:33.642
TRAVIS: Sail!

00:41:33.642 --> 00:41:34.720
MARISHA: 14.

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:37.812
MATT: So you jump, skip off the ground and--

00:41:37.812 --> 00:41:39.229
LAURA: Skip off the ground?!

00:41:39.229 --> 00:41:44.783
MATT: On the small stone in the center there and
use the momentum from that with the staff

00:41:44.783 --> 00:41:46.315
swinging, go ahead make your strike against the--

00:41:46.315 --> 00:41:57.473
MARISHA: I'm going to swing upwards. Yep, that's a
natural 16, so 21. I don't know why I rolled that

00:41:57.473 --> 00:42:00.700
die, that's not necessary. Nine damage.

00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:07.889
MATT: Nine damage. With that, you manage to slap
that one into two separate pieces that go slapping

00:42:07.889 --> 00:42:12.893
and sliding against the wall and splatter and
begin to slick down the side of the cavern exterior.

00:42:12.893 --> 00:42:15.342
MARISHA: I take my staff and I wipe it on Caleb.

00:42:15.342 --> 00:42:19.684
MATT: Your hair's slick back from the blood from
the impact and the wound that gets taken.

00:42:19.684 --> 00:42:23.563
LIAM: In a split second before when I heard a
blunt (impact): Oh, that was Beau.

00:42:23.563 --> 00:42:28.512
MARISHA: Sorry, are you all right? Your head's
okay?

00:42:28.512 --> 00:42:32.275
LIAM: I'm feeling pretty good. I feel
streamlined.

00:42:32.275 --> 00:42:36.656
MARISHA: Yeah, the oil's working for you.

00:42:36.656 --> 00:42:37.635
LIAM: Yeah, I clean up well.

00:42:37.635 --> 00:42:38.173
MARISHA: Yeah, very dapper.

00:42:38.173 --> 00:42:47.919
MATT: Ending Beau's turn, Beau, Caleb, Molly, and
Jester you hear this mild rumble, and you watch as

00:42:47.919 --> 00:42:55.648
from the somewhat rocky outside of the two sides
of the wall these large figures begin to burst

00:42:55.648 --> 00:43:02.699
from the exterior and begin to slowly make their
way towards the edge. So their action and movement

00:43:02.699 --> 00:43:05.780
puts them right up to there, and this one moves up
to there.

00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:07.639
LAURA: Earth elementals?

00:43:07.639 --> 00:43:13.521
MATT: You see them covered in greenish algae and
vines. They look like they're made of earth and

00:43:13.521 --> 00:43:19.423
stone. You're not certain what the nature of what
they are. They're bottom heavy and crawling across

00:43:19.423 --> 00:43:22.608
the ground and pulling their body forward. You're
not even sure if they have feet.

00:43:22.608 --> 00:43:24.045
LAURA: (screaming)

00:43:24.045 --> 00:43:25.223
SAM: Good gravy.

00:43:25.223 --> 00:43:29.480
MATT: They're coming up to the edge of the river.
That's going to end Beau's turn. Molly, you're up.

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:31.050
LAURA: Oh my god.

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:33.432
TALIESIN: Oh.

00:43:33.432 --> 00:43:36.515
(laughter)

00:43:36.515 --> 00:43:37.126
TRAVIS: You did a--

00:43:37.126 --> 00:43:39.980
TALIESIN: Sure, I know. Are they within striking
distance?

00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:41.853
MATT: They're not yet, no.

00:43:41.853 --> 00:43:47.232
TALIESIN: I'm going to hold my action until
something's within striking distance.

00:43:47.633 --> 00:43:47.972
MATT: Okay.

00:43:47.972 --> 00:43:53.479
TALIESIN: I will also say I'm at least going to
back up to the side of the boat where I'm far

00:43:53.479 --> 00:43:55.757
enough away from that thing as humanly possible.

00:43:55.757 --> 00:43:57.839
MATT: Okay. Well, that's where Jester is.

00:43:57.839 --> 00:43:58.718
TALIESIN: Oh, well fine.

00:43:58.718 --> 00:44:04.805
MATT: So you're like, "Oh!" Jester still has the
oars in place. Does that finish your turn?

00:44:04.805 --> 00:44:05.357
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:44:05.357 --> 00:44:06.998
MATT: All righty, Jester your turn.

00:44:06.998 --> 00:44:13.904
LAURA: Oh gosh. Well, I hate to use my action to
do anything else, but I should probably try to get

00:44:13.904 --> 00:44:16.510
away from the thing that's on the shore, huh?

00:44:16.510 --> 00:44:17.919
SAM: You're going to action row?

00:44:17.919 --> 00:44:19.104
LAURA: I'm going to action row!

00:44:19.104 --> 00:44:21.131
MATT: All right, make a strength check please.

00:44:21.131 --> 00:44:22.583
LAURA: Strength check!

00:44:22.583 --> 00:44:24.757
SAM: Oar Master.

00:44:24.757 --> 00:44:31.577
LAURA: That's a good one. That's just Jester's
strength. That's a 22.

00:44:31.577 --> 00:44:42.909
MATT: Oh shit! Jester is power rowing as it begins
to (motor whir) down the river to about there.

00:44:42.909 --> 00:44:44.419
LIAM: Half of the skiff.

00:44:44.419 --> 00:44:45.398
TRAVIS: Got to go!

00:44:45.398 --> 00:44:50.704
MATT: You scoot by. The entity gets to the edge of
the water and then watches it pass, its body

00:44:50.704 --> 00:44:53.066
shifting. It looks powerful, but it looks
slow-moving.

00:44:53.066 --> 00:44:57.244
LAURA: I'm going to use my bonus action to turn
around and go: Eat shit, rock face!

00:44:57.244 --> 00:45:01.554
MATT: Perfect. That ends Jester's turn. Yasha,
you're up.

00:45:01.554 --> 00:45:03.052
ASHLEY: All right. Yeah, I'm going to try to--

00:45:03.052 --> 00:45:05.703
MATT: Maneuver around?

00:45:05.703 --> 00:45:06.798
ASHLEY: Maneuver around.

00:45:06.798 --> 00:45:07.918
SAM: Smash into their boat?

00:45:07.918 --> 00:45:08.776
MATT: Go ahead and make a strength check.

00:45:08.776 --> 00:45:12.782
LIAM: Still the only light in here are my four
globules, correct?

00:45:12.782 --> 00:45:14.059
MATT: Correct, which actually you had to roll a
concentration check for.

00:45:14.059 --> 00:45:15.879
LAURA: Oh god.

00:45:15.879 --> 00:45:17.026
LIAM: Not so good.

00:45:17.026 --> 00:45:17.850
ASHLEY: 19.

00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:18.655
LIAM: Nine.

00:45:18.655 --> 00:45:24.687
MATT: All right, so it is dark in here. Remember
the Dancing Lights is concentration.

00:45:24.687 --> 00:45:26.210
SAM: Can we see anything?

00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:27.982
MATT: No, it is now absolutely pitch dark.

00:45:27.982 --> 00:45:28.972
LAURA: It's pitch dark?!

00:45:28.972 --> 00:45:30.025
MATT: It's pitch dark, yeah.

00:45:30.025 --> 00:45:32.965
TALIESIN: Didn't you cast a Light spell?

00:45:32.965 --> 00:45:33.700
ASHLEY: I did.

00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:35.494
LAURA: It got eaten by the darkness.

00:45:35.494 --> 00:45:44.044
MATT: Yeah, it dispels the Light, unfortunately.
It doesn't encapsulate it. It dispels it. So you

00:45:44.044 --> 00:45:46.418
begin rowing in the direction in the darkness.
What'd you roll?

00:45:46.418 --> 00:45:46.899
ASHLEY: 19.

00:45:46.899 --> 00:45:54.081
MATT: 19? Oh yeah. Without issue, you can row past
and just begin to get beyond your friends there.

00:45:54.081 --> 00:45:59.597
LAURA: We crash into each other and get stuck. Ah,
let me go!

00:45:59.597 --> 00:46:04.525
MATT: That's going to end Yasha's go. Caleb,
you're up.

00:46:04.525 --> 00:46:06.551
LIAM: (foomphs)

00:46:06.551 --> 00:46:09.303
MATT: Okay, a couple lights go up again. You guys
go from darkness to immediate light again and

00:46:09.303 --> 00:46:15.866
behind you see the two creatures dragging
themselves forward by their upper body.

00:46:15.866 --> 00:46:20.542
LIAM: I scrabble back and squish in with Nott at
the front of the boat.

00:46:20.542 --> 00:46:26.559
MATT: Okay. Top of the round now. The water
carries the boats further down--

00:46:26.559 --> 00:46:28.279
SAM: We might be okay.

00:46:28.279 --> 00:46:30.173
MATT: To about there.

00:46:30.173 --> 00:46:32.497
LAURA: I think those things are going to get us.

00:46:32.497 --> 00:46:33.234
MARISHA: Eventually.

00:46:33.234 --> 00:46:37.530
MATT: We'll say here, with the movement of the
creatures, actually, they can't catch up, because

00:46:37.530 --> 00:46:39.066
you guys managed to push ahead.

00:46:39.066 --> 00:46:41.187
SAM: Action row!

00:46:41.187 --> 00:46:45.252
MARISHA: Full Winklevoss twins!

00:46:45.252 --> 00:46:48.092
MATT: For the purposes of cinematic movement on
this, you guys continue to row as hard as you can,

00:46:48.092 --> 00:46:52.013
looking back with the light pushed towards the
back to give a view. They are failing to keep up

00:46:52.013 --> 00:46:57.890
with both Yasha and Jester keeping the ships going
at full speed. Eventually, they both stop and

00:46:57.890 --> 00:47:01.520
begin to back up, heading back towards the
vicinity where they had originally emerged,

00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:03.401
disappearing into the shadows and darkness behind
you.

00:47:03.401 --> 00:47:05.464
SAM: We'll never know what they were, what they
could have done!

00:47:05.464 --> 00:47:08.863
LAURA: I know. Actually, I'm feeling a little
guilty for calling him-- What if he just wanted to

00:47:08.863 --> 00:47:09.520
be friends?

00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:12.185
SAM: That's true. Maybe they had information for
us.

00:47:12.185 --> 00:47:16.865
MARISHA: You're feeling guilty for calling him
rock-face, but not for telling him to eat shit? I

00:47:16.865 --> 00:47:18.974
like that. That's great.

00:47:24.754 --> 00:47:25.533
LIAM: Bye!

00:47:26.713 --> 00:47:33.911
MATT: As the sounds of the underground river begin
to fill your senses once more, you settle and

00:47:33.911 --> 00:47:43.686
listen, and the quiet, aside from the slow rushing
of the river, is all you hear. Who's at the front

00:47:43.686 --> 00:47:45.593
of each boat keeping an eye out?

00:47:45.593 --> 00:47:46.960
TRAVIS: I'm at the front of ours.

00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:49.517
MATT: Fjord moves to the front of that boat. Who's
at the front of the other?

00:47:49.517 --> 00:47:50.224
LIAM: I guess I am.

00:47:50.224 --> 00:47:52.956
MATT: I would like you both to make a perception
check, please.

00:47:52.956 --> 00:47:59.060
SAM: Crazy roll there, Travis.

00:47:59.060 --> 00:48:03.153
TRAVIS: Forget that. I get to reroll. That's a
natural one.

00:48:03.153 --> 00:48:07.463
(cheering)

00:48:07.463 --> 00:48:08.062
LIAM: 12.

00:48:08.062 --> 00:48:16.586
MATT: 12. Okay. As you guys are moving along,
Fjord, mildly distracted, partially from the mist

00:48:16.586 --> 00:48:19.710
that is rising up from the ice and armor--

00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:23.539
MARISHA: Drinking a drink with cold ice.

00:48:23.539 --> 00:48:28.384
MATT: Caleb, you focus off to the side, and to the
north side of the riverbank you see a shift in

00:48:28.384 --> 00:48:35.791
texture and a mild rock slide. Part of the wall
has caved in a bit and is now pushing into part of

00:48:35.791 --> 00:48:36.414
the river.

00:48:36.414 --> 00:48:39.258
LIAM: Halt. Wait. Stop.

00:48:39.258 --> 00:48:41.201
SAM: He says to stop!

00:48:41.201 --> 00:48:47.026
LAURA: I'm trying!

00:48:47.026 --> 00:48:48.509
SAM: Action brakes!

00:48:48.509 --> 00:48:50.537
LAURA: (squeals)

00:48:50.537 --> 00:48:52.840
LIAM: Can you fight against the current for a
moment?

00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:54.225
LAURA: Yeah, we're rowing backwards.

00:48:54.225 --> 00:48:59.551
LIAM: Okay, it's going to get dark in here for a
second, all right? But don't worry. I drop the

00:48:59.551 --> 00:49:03.746
globules and I cast Detect Magic.

00:49:03.746 --> 00:49:12.517
MATT: Okay. So as you focus on-- What's the range
on that one?

00:49:12.517 --> 00:49:17.016
LIAM: It is only 30 feet.

00:49:17.016 --> 00:49:22.192
MATT: 30 feet, okay. As you guys drift lazily down
the course of the river--

00:49:22.192 --> 00:49:22.784
LAURA: Slowly.

00:49:22.784 --> 00:49:27.431
LIAM: I'm focusing, obviously, on the rock slide
that you just described.

00:49:27.431 --> 00:49:37.307
MATT: As you move in that direction past the rock
slide, you get a faint source of magic further

00:49:37.307 --> 00:49:39.047
beyond that rock slide.

00:49:39.047 --> 00:49:39.995
LIAM: Beyond the rock slide?

00:49:39.995 --> 00:49:44.584
MATT: You get a better look at it. Actually, you
don't get a better look because you don't have light.

00:49:44.584 --> 00:49:49.534
LIAM: That's on one side of the passage that we
are in?

00:49:50.085 --> 00:49:50.992
MATT: That's on the north side of it, yes.

00:49:50.992 --> 00:49:54.768
LIAM: If I crane my neck in the other direction,
is there anything on that side?

00:49:54.768 --> 00:49:58.871
MATT: Nope. Nothing of magical essence on that
side of the chamber.

00:49:58.871 --> 00:50:07.102
LIAM: All right, well, in the darkness, you hear:
There is something of an arcane nature in the

00:50:07.102 --> 00:50:12.584
middle of those rocks that were ahead of us. What
do you want to do? Do you want to go scrabbling in

00:50:12.584 --> 00:50:18.492
the dirt or do you want to keep going forward? It
could be something beneficial or it could be terrible.

00:50:18.497 --> 00:50:22.082
SAM: Are there sides of the river?

00:50:22.082 --> 00:50:23.885
LIAM: Nobody can see anything right now.

00:50:23.885 --> 00:50:27.304
MATT: Those with darkvision get a better view as
they get closer. At this point, you've gotten

00:50:27.304 --> 00:50:31.558
close enough for your magical essence so you get a
view of this, Nott. You can see on the northern

00:50:31.558 --> 00:50:39.992
side of it, the cavern wall that has been slowly
shifting through millennia of mineral buildup

00:50:39.992 --> 00:50:48.419
changes into bits of solid, smooth stone and a
portion of it collapsed into what this rock slide is.

00:50:48.419 --> 00:50:53.019
MARISHA: We were looking for a collapse. A change
in texture.

00:50:53.724 --> 00:50:54.418
SAM: We should go investigate.

00:50:54.418 --> 00:50:55.025
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:50:55.025 --> 00:50:55.654
MARISHA: This is it.

00:50:55.654 --> 00:50:57.456
LAURA: Should we park the boats?

00:50:57.456 --> 00:50:59.061
TALIESIN: Let's park the boats.

00:50:59.061 --> 00:51:00.682
LAURA: Can we have some light?

00:51:04.462 --> 00:51:09.368
LIAM: Does anyone have a torch? I would prefer to
keep this up for the time being.

00:51:10.248 --> 00:51:11.631
ASHLEY: I pull out a torch.

00:51:11.631 --> 00:51:18.753
MATT: Yasha ignites a torch. The fire burns
brightly and the interior of this chamber now is

00:51:18.753 --> 00:51:22.570
very easy to see the details around you. The water
is still cruising by as you guys begin to make

00:51:22.570 --> 00:51:26.523
your way up along the shore a bit, stepping off to
the side of the river and pulling the boats up on

00:51:26.523 --> 00:51:29.974
the rocks. They're not going to continue to be
carried down by the stream.

00:51:31.234 --> 00:51:37.698
SAM: I'm going to take my old little dry flowers
and just stick them in his gross, ichor-y hair.

00:51:39.538 --> 00:51:41.293
LIAM: Do I look like The Gentleman right now?

00:51:42.763 --> 00:51:44.793
MATT: The Gentleman on hard times, maybe.

00:51:44.793 --> 00:51:45.509
LIAM: Okay.

00:51:45.509 --> 00:51:46.747
LAURA: A little less blue.

00:51:49.257 --> 00:51:50.464
LIAM: It's not that weird.

00:51:50.464 --> 00:51:59.642
MATT: Past about a roughly ten-foot wide portion
of this wall that has fallen in, part of the

00:51:59.642 --> 00:52:06.682
ceiling has come in and above it is just dirt.
It's loose rock and pieces of well-carved stone

00:52:06.682 --> 00:52:12.264
and masonry that have been destroyed, apparently
upon exiting whatever was beyond this wall.

00:52:12.264 --> 00:52:17.653
LIAM: Can I see what was giving me the arcane
signature?

00:52:17.653 --> 00:52:21.343
MATT: You feel it on the opposite, the other side
of this rock slide.

00:52:21.343 --> 00:52:23.601
LAURA: Can we clear out these rocks?

00:52:23.601 --> 00:52:25.671
TRAVIS: I think we just need to get closer.

00:52:25.671 --> 00:52:27.026
LAURA: But we're right here.

00:52:27.026 --> 00:52:31.365
LIAM: Yeah. What about you two beefcakes? Can you
move these stones out of the way?

00:52:31.365 --> 00:52:36.717
ASHLEY and LAURA: (grunting)

00:52:36.717 --> 00:52:40.534
MATT: Both of you make athletics checks to get
through the endurance of pulling these stones out

00:52:40.534 --> 00:52:41.336
of the way.

00:52:41.336 --> 00:52:50.115
LAURA: Well, that's totally cocked, that was
terrible. Athletics?

00:52:50.115 --> 00:52:50.686
MATT: Yes.

00:52:52.426 --> 00:52:52.965
ASHLEY: 16.

00:52:53.485 --> 00:52:54.236
LAURA: 13.

00:52:54.236 --> 00:53:01.164
MATT: Between the two of you, about ten minutes
pass as you watch your two beefy companions, one

00:53:01.164 --> 00:53:04.851
after another, moving large stones and rocks,
scooping them out of the way, some spilling and

00:53:04.851 --> 00:53:08.877
rolling into the water, other ones being pushed
off to the side.

00:53:08.877 --> 00:53:13.888
LIAM: Question, because the spell that I cast only
lasts ten minutes, somewhere around the eight or

00:53:13.888 --> 00:53:19.083
nine minute mark, do I see-- You said it was on
the other side of the rock slide, so are they

00:53:19.083 --> 00:53:21.759
uncovering anything before the spell is gone?

00:53:21.759 --> 00:53:28.794
MATT: I'd say about the time it begins to fade,
you guys begin to see a faint purple glow through

00:53:28.794 --> 00:53:36.754
a breach of this slide leading into the next
chamber. It's a very faint pinkish purple light source.

00:53:36.754 --> 00:53:38.740
SAM: Like coming from another room?

00:53:39.413 --> 00:53:41.900
MATT: Coming from that room. It looks like there's
a room or a chamber beyond.

00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:43.498
LIAM: So not a door, but just a passageway?

00:53:44.248 --> 00:53:47.631
MATT: You're just starting to expose it a bit. All
you're seeing is the light and stone on the

00:53:47.631 --> 00:53:51.915
opposite end. But there is a gap. There's about a
ten-foot space between where you're starting to

00:53:51.915 --> 00:53:56.201
see this and where you see the light reflecting on
whatever this other surface is within. About then,

00:53:56.201 --> 00:53:57.153
your spell fades.

00:53:57.153 --> 00:53:59.644
LIAM: The torch is still up.

00:54:00.198 --> 00:54:03.933
MATT: The torch is still up, yeah. You guys manage
to pull the stones from it, the final bits leaving

00:54:03.933 --> 00:54:08.749
just enough of a space where you can crawl through
independently. You are now looking into the center

00:54:08.749 --> 00:54:10.112
of a spiral staircase.

00:54:10.112 --> 00:54:15.109
TRAVIS: I remember they said they threw an
explosive behind them and dropped even more, so

00:54:15.109 --> 00:54:17.551
this won't be the first rock slide.

00:54:17.551 --> 00:54:22.856
MARISHA: They said that the glowing orbs that made
the men collapse were purple.

00:54:23.486 --> 00:54:26.117
SAM: This all checks out. We are in the right
place.

00:54:26.117 --> 00:54:28.495
TALIESIN: Does that sound like a will-o'-wisp?

00:54:28.495 --> 00:54:34.550
MATT: Will-o'-wisps generally fade like a dull
yellow-green color.

00:54:34.550 --> 00:54:36.004
TALIESIN: Does this ring any bells, then?

00:54:36.004 --> 00:54:42.926
MATT: Not particularly. As you begin to move
beyond, you can look up inside this spiral

00:54:42.926 --> 00:54:50.194
staircase. Above you and about two feet up the
corner, there is a wrought iron cage that is built

00:54:50.194 --> 00:54:55.996
into the wall, containing a small crystal-like
stone that is purple in color that is giving off

00:54:55.996 --> 00:54:57.110
this light source.

00:54:57.110 --> 00:55:03.299
LAURA: Ooh. Hey, Caleb, look! Don't you want to
steal that? It's probably magic.

00:55:03.299 --> 00:55:07.996
LIAM: It's possible that I will want to steal it,
but can I make anything out? Does it look like

00:55:08.455 --> 00:55:10.037
anything that I have read about or encountered
before?

00:55:10.037 --> 00:55:14.442
MATT: There have been different artifacts that
have been enchanted with equivalents of either

00:55:14.442 --> 00:55:20.347
Continuous Flame or a magic that themselves can
emanate light. The way it's affixed to here, it

00:55:20.347 --> 00:55:21.892
looks like it's designed to be a general light
source.

00:55:21.892 --> 00:55:22.882
LIAM: So it's a glow stick.

00:55:22.882 --> 00:55:24.135
MATT: Essentially, yeah. It's a purple glow
stick.

00:55:24.135 --> 00:55:27.244
TRAVIS: Well, let's get in there.

00:55:27.244 --> 00:55:29.074
LIAM: But it's in an iron cage?

00:55:29.074 --> 00:55:33.093
MATT: Like a small iron cage that is bolted into
the stone.

00:55:33.093 --> 00:55:34.911
MARISHA: That's a nice sconce.

00:55:34.911 --> 00:55:36.827
LIAM: Let's continue on.

00:55:36.827 --> 00:55:39.687
MATT: Okay, you have two directions. Up or down?

00:55:39.687 --> 00:55:42.296
LAURA: Would you want to go up?

00:55:42.296 --> 00:55:45.426
TRAVIS: Wait, we're in the spiral staircase and it
goes--

00:55:45.426 --> 00:55:51.341
MATT: It goes up or down. You pull through and
begin to find your way into the spiral staircase.

00:55:51.341 --> 00:55:56.285
It's about, roughly, eight or ten feet wide as it
continues downward. It also continues upward.

00:55:56.285 --> 00:55:58.417
You're entering partway through the staircase.

00:55:58.417 --> 00:55:58.993
SAM: Oh.

00:55:58.993 --> 00:56:03.067
TRAVIS: We can't see around the bend to how far
down it goes, right? Is it an open spiral

00:56:03.067 --> 00:56:04.244
staircase or just a wall?

00:56:04.244 --> 00:56:07.536
MATT: No, no. It's closed. There's an actual
column in the center of it so you have to traverse

00:56:07.536 --> 00:56:09.850
up or down to get more of a view of where it
leads.

00:56:09.850 --> 00:56:13.178
LIAM: Before we leave this little cage, does it
look bolted into place?

00:56:13.178 --> 00:56:16.237
LAURA: It's a couple flights up, though, you
said?

00:56:16.237 --> 00:56:20.302
MATT: Well, no. It's just right around the corner
on the edge, locked into the central pillar.

00:56:20.302 --> 00:56:22.331
TRAVIS: We can only see as far up as the curves go
in either direction.

00:56:22.331 --> 00:56:26.630
MATT: Yeah. It looks like the edges of the cage
where the metal has been bent--

00:56:26.630 --> 00:56:27.231
LIAM: It's small?

00:56:27.231 --> 00:56:31.535
MATT: It's small. It's about that big and it's
pressed into the stone, like the stone was

00:56:31.535 --> 00:56:35.760
probably ground into various holes and then the
iron was put in there and then sealed in. You

00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:37.659
don't know how easy or hard it would be to
remove.

00:56:37.659 --> 00:56:39.703
TRAVIS: Unless it lets people know when something
crosses in front of it.

00:56:39.703 --> 00:56:42.462
LIAM: Maybe later. Let's continue on. Which way do
we want to go?

00:56:42.462 --> 00:56:45.137
LAURA: Let's go down. Usually scarier things are
down.

00:56:45.137 --> 00:56:46.718
MARISHA: I'm always a fan of going down.

00:56:46.718 --> 00:56:49.455
TALIESIN: More expensive things tend to be up, but
I'm happy to start with down.

00:56:49.455 --> 00:56:50.499
SAM: Gross. Just gross.

00:56:50.499 --> 00:56:51.916
MARISHA: What?

00:56:51.916 --> 00:56:53.089
SAM: You're super gross.

00:56:53.089 --> 00:56:54.257
TALIESIN: I didn't even catch that!

00:56:54.257 --> 00:56:57.192
LIAM: You have one setting. Naughty.

00:56:57.192 --> 00:56:58.272
SAM: Offensive!

00:56:58.272 --> 00:57:00.059
TRAVIS: We're going to head downwards.

00:57:00.059 --> 00:57:03.122
MATT: All right. What is the marching order
heading downward?

00:57:03.122 --> 00:57:06.089
SAM: We're going down? Do you need me to check for
traps?

00:57:06.089 --> 00:57:06.809
TRAVIS: Yeah, please.

00:57:06.809 --> 00:57:08.552
LAURA: Yeah, so Nott in front.

00:57:08.552 --> 00:57:10.348
MATT: Nott in front. Who's after Nott?

00:57:10.348 --> 00:57:11.373
ASHLEY: I'll go behind Nott.

00:57:11.373 --> 00:57:15.228
SAM: I'll take a big swig of shitty alcohol.

00:57:15.228 --> 00:57:17.031
MATT: Okay. Who's after Yasha?

00:57:17.031 --> 00:57:19.817
LAURA: I guess I can be after Yasha.

00:57:19.817 --> 00:57:21.821
MATT: All right. Jester after Yasha.

00:57:21.821 --> 00:57:22.686
TRAVIS: I'm right in the middle.

00:57:22.686 --> 00:57:25.173
TALIESIN: I'm after Jester or after Fjord.

00:57:25.173 --> 00:57:26.644
TRAVIS: Where do you want to be?

00:57:26.644 --> 00:57:27.877
MARISHA: I'll take up the rears.

00:57:27.877 --> 00:57:30.175
SAM: (deep voice) I always take up the rears.

00:57:30.175 --> 00:57:33.647
ASHLEY: I'm always a fan of the rears.

00:57:33.647 --> 00:57:41.130
LIAM: Yeah, I was going to say not the back, but I
will let the bruiser walk behind me.

00:57:41.130 --> 00:57:46.092
MATT: So Beau's at the back keeping an eye open.
As you guys slowly step down the stone stairs,

00:57:46.092 --> 00:57:48.247
deeper and deeper still--

00:57:48.247 --> 00:57:49.379
SAM: Check for traps!

00:57:49.379 --> 00:57:50.891
MATT: Go ahead and make an investigation check.

00:57:50.891 --> 00:57:52.310
TRAVIS: That's cocked as hell.

00:57:52.310 --> 00:57:54.487
SAM: Is that cocked? As hell?

00:57:54.487 --> 00:57:55.761
MATT: Is there a number up top?

00:57:55.761 --> 00:57:57.970
SAM: There is, but now it just moved.

00:57:57.970 --> 00:57:59.419
MATT: Roll it again.

00:57:59.419 --> 00:58:02.729
SAM: Well, that's a natural 20.

00:58:02.729 --> 00:58:06.000
(laughter)

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:07.400
SAM: That's an embarrassing 20.

00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:17.261
MATT: You guys continue down for about 40 feet or
so, very slowly, very carefully, as Nott inspects

00:58:17.261 --> 00:58:25.709
each individual step, eyes lurking around looking
for any signs of uneven stone, of gaps between the

00:58:25.709 --> 00:58:31.366
mason work. Nothing catches your attention. You
hit the very base of the stairway before it evens

00:58:31.366 --> 00:58:38.146
out. There is a small intermediate chamber that's
about 15 feet wide and only about five feet--

00:58:38.146 --> 00:58:44.060
sorry. 15 feet long and about five feet wide, and
then a thin hallway about four or five feet wide

00:58:44.060 --> 00:58:49.163
that goes on for about 25 feet. You don't see
anything beyond that. There is no light other than

00:58:49.163 --> 00:58:50.993
the torch light that you have currently.

00:58:50.993 --> 00:58:53.410
SAM: It's 15 feet long?

00:58:53.410 --> 00:58:55.781
MATT: So as you exit the stairs--

00:58:55.781 --> 00:58:57.029
LIAM: The shaft is.

00:58:57.029 --> 00:58:59.580
MATT: It's essentially five feet to each way on
the ends.

00:58:59.580 --> 00:59:00.154
LAURA: Okay.

00:59:00.154 --> 00:59:01.869
LIAM: (laughing) No!

00:59:01.869 --> 00:59:03.639
SAM: Yeah?

00:59:03.639 --> 00:59:09.379
TRAVIS: Why are you cupping the balls under your
mouth?

00:59:09.379 --> 00:59:10.913
SAM: Because this is where we are.

00:59:10.913 --> 00:59:12.807
MATT: It's a rusty trombone, man. You never seen
that?

00:59:12.807 --> 00:59:19.257
SAM: This is the shaft in front of me, and then
there's another? A longer shaft? So we can go down

00:59:19.257 --> 00:59:21.007
that shaft if we wanted to?

00:59:21.007 --> 00:59:28.647
MATT: Yes. Yes, Nott. That is correct. It looks to
be five feet to each side of you once you exit the

00:59:28.647 --> 00:59:30.852
stairs, like a resting space.

00:59:30.852 --> 00:59:31.812
SAM: Okay, these are the balls.

00:59:31.812 --> 00:59:35.057
MATT: And then there is a four to five-foot wide
shaft that continues forward.

00:59:35.057 --> 00:59:41.836
MARISHA: <i>I</i> have no chill? You talk to me two
minutes later.

00:59:41.836 --> 00:59:43.174
MATT: I know. I'm proud of you.

00:59:43.174 --> 00:59:44.433
LIAM: Has it been that long?

00:59:44.433 --> 00:59:45.991
MARISHA: I don't think so.

00:59:45.991 --> 00:59:51.047
SAM: I have no idea of the layout of this room. I
was just going for a gag.

00:59:51.047 --> 00:59:56.718
MATT: Congratulations! Nott's been drinking enough
where she's not entirely certain where things are

00:59:56.718 --> 00:59:57.590
or where you are.

00:59:57.590 --> 01:00:01.225
LAURA: Are we free of traps in this little--

01:00:01.225 --> 01:00:02.758
SAM: There are no traps here.

01:00:02.758 --> 01:00:03.223
LAURA: Okay.

01:00:03.223 --> 01:00:06.790
SAM: Should we continue on straight ahead?

01:00:06.790 --> 01:00:12.550
LAURA: Should we send Frumpkin down there and see
if it's clear?

01:00:12.550 --> 01:00:13.171
SAM: Or Schmidt.

01:00:13.171 --> 01:00:19.115
LIAM: Well, Schmidt can't see shit, but Frumpkin--
can my cat see in the dark? I would know that. I

01:00:19.115 --> 01:00:19.721
don't know.

01:00:19.721 --> 01:00:24.207
MATT: Cats, generally nocturnal? I would say it
would have, unless it says in the actual-- I will

01:00:24.207 --> 01:00:31.643
look in the Monster Manual. I'm fairly certain,
having grown up with cats, that being nocturnal

01:00:31.643 --> 01:00:32.765
creatures they'd have it.

01:00:32.765 --> 01:00:36.821
LIAM: It makes sense for anyone who had gone into
their basement and seen the cat go (humming).

01:00:36.821 --> 01:00:38.381
LAURA: Oh, yeah. Cats can see.

01:00:38.381 --> 01:00:40.670
TALIESIN: Cats can see your soul.

01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:43.225
MATT: They do not have darkvision, according to
the rules.

01:00:43.225 --> 01:00:45.061
LIAM: Okay, well, let's go by the rules, then.

01:00:45.061 --> 01:00:46.584
LAURA: The rules need to be changed.

01:00:46.584 --> 01:00:48.351
MATT: But they do have perception on vision.

01:00:48.351 --> 01:00:51.590
LAURA: Why don't you send your little dancing
lights down there with him?

01:00:51.590 --> 01:00:57.327
LIAM: Well, I have a range on that. I don't like
that idea, actually.

01:00:57.327 --> 01:01:02.028
LAURA: What if I just send something that's on
fire and I throw it down the tunnel?

01:01:02.028 --> 01:01:12.001
LIAM: How about I send Frumpkin with you and
between Frumpkin and you, we'll be in good shape?

01:01:12.001 --> 01:01:14.011
SAM: Me and Frumpkin?

01:01:14.011 --> 01:01:14.710
LIAM: Yeah.

01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:16.553
SAM: Am I protecting--

01:01:16.553 --> 01:01:17.824
LIAM: You're just peeking.

01:01:17.824 --> 01:01:19.452
SAM: Okay. All right.

01:01:19.452 --> 01:01:27.140
LIAM: Who am I behind? Mollymauk. I place hands on
his shoulders and send Frumpkin down ten feet

01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:29.280
ahead of Nott and I'm seeing--

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:30.167
MATT: Ten feet ahead of Nott?

01:01:30.167 --> 01:01:36.898
LIAM: Yeah, or listening, and trying to listen and
see through Frumpkin.

01:01:38.498 --> 01:01:42.547
MATT: Frumpkin darts ahead down that long,
25-foot, very thin hallway to the opposite side

01:01:42.547 --> 01:01:46.237
and in the next chamber, what little bit of
light's making it in there-- because it's pretty

01:01:46.237 --> 01:01:49.492
low light, based on what little bit of torch is
coming through, and it's like a lantern light at

01:01:49.492 --> 01:01:54.748
this point, because only what's coming through
that hallway is then spreading out before you. You

01:01:54.748 --> 01:02:02.441
see a raised platform, about a foot high. It looks
triangular in shape in the center of this room,

01:02:02.441 --> 01:02:06.397
and that's all you can make out with the little
bit of light that's there, but the room continues

01:02:06.992 --> 01:02:11.199
on about another 20 or so feet beyond that
entrance before it goes to darkness.

01:02:11.199 --> 01:02:14.118
LIAM: So it gets too dark and hazy past that
altar.

01:02:14.118 --> 01:02:14.395
MATT: Correct.

01:02:18.505 --> 01:02:25.386
LIAM: Yasha, can you hand the torch down and get
it to Nott so that she can go a little bit further?

01:02:25.386 --> 01:02:27.275
MATT: Nott, are you traveling down the hallway as
well?

01:02:27.275 --> 01:02:29.732
SAM: I'm ten feet behind the cat.

01:02:29.732 --> 01:02:36.645
MATT: All right. As you approach the first bit of
that hallway that continues downward, you step in,

01:02:36.645 --> 01:02:41.901
and at that moment, you hear this (click) and
glance over to the right of you, as you checked

01:02:41.901 --> 01:02:48.889
for traps in the stairs, but not the hallway. You
glance off to the side and can see a scattering of

01:02:48.889 --> 01:02:54.773
holes on each side of the wall, about nine or ten
of them at different angles, and one of them goes

01:02:54.773 --> 01:03:00.229
(click). You glance over before something comes
firing out at extremely fast, lightning speed

01:03:00.229 --> 01:03:00.839
towards you.

01:03:01.849 --> 01:03:02.854
MARISHA: Rogue shit!

01:03:05.274 --> 01:03:06.846
MATT: That's going to be a 26 to hit.

01:03:06.846 --> 01:03:08.263
SAM: That hits.

01:03:09.483 --> 01:03:17.441
MATT: You take five points of piercing damage as a
long, metal bolt fires out of the hole and sticks

01:03:17.441 --> 01:03:19.418
you right in the front of the thigh.

01:03:19.418 --> 01:03:22.270
SAM: Ah! Fuck!

01:03:22.270 --> 01:03:27.467
(laughter)

01:03:27.467 --> 01:03:29.226
SAM: I found a trap!

01:03:32.216 --> 01:03:33.144
LAURA: Really?

01:03:33.144 --> 01:03:34.858
LIAM: Is it spent now?

01:03:34.858 --> 01:03:41.304
SAM: Let me check. I'll see if there's any other
triggers for this trap.

01:03:41.304 --> 01:03:45.152
MATT: On this trap, at this floor point? You jump
up and down. Make an investigation check if you

01:03:45.417 --> 01:03:46.389
want to, in the area.

01:03:46.389 --> 01:03:46.884
SAM: 22.

01:03:46.884 --> 01:03:57.119
MATT: It looks like, whatever this trap is, the
actual entire stone floor around you is a pressure

01:03:57.119 --> 01:04:04.135
plate that Frumpkin did not set off. It has not
gone off since you've stepped on it, but as you're

01:04:04.135 --> 01:04:08.625
investigating and listening closely to the stone,
you hear a very slow (clicking).

01:04:08.625 --> 01:04:10.969
LAURA: Oh, it's resetting.

01:04:10.969 --> 01:04:17.417
SAM: I'm going to go forward a bit, onto the next
pressure plate.

01:04:17.417 --> 01:04:21.082
MATT: Okay, that is 14 to hit?

01:04:21.082 --> 01:04:22.424
SAM: Does not hit.

01:04:22.424 --> 01:04:25.852
MATT: Does not hit? This time, hearing the (arrow
firing) out of the side, and being ready for it,

01:04:25.852 --> 01:04:29.273
you duck out of the way and it splinters off and
sparks against the stone.

01:04:29.273 --> 01:04:30.498
SAM: Oh god. There's many of them.

01:04:30.498 --> 01:04:32.052
LIAM: Are you going to tell everybody about the
pressure plates?

01:04:32.052 --> 01:04:34.531
SAM: Oh god, there's lots of traps! I'm dying out
here!

01:04:34.531 --> 01:04:38.718
(laughter)

01:04:38.718 --> 01:04:40.897
LAURA: We're just seeing you. You're really close
to us, aren't you?

01:04:40.897 --> 01:04:49.735
SAM: Boy, oh boy, rogues suck. How much further
until the end of this hall?

01:04:49.735 --> 01:04:51.541
MATT: About ten feet from where you are.

01:04:51.541 --> 01:04:54.557
LAURA: Can you disarm the traps so you don't keep
just setting them off?

01:04:54.557 --> 01:04:56.734
LIAM: Do we have anything heavy to put on them to
hold them down?

01:04:56.734 --> 01:04:59.336
SAM: They reset, though, right? I don't know!

01:04:59.336 --> 01:05:00.362
LIAM: We don't know.

01:05:00.362 --> 01:05:05.535
SAM: I'm on this one, and I'm going to listen to
see if this one's resetting also.

01:05:05.535 --> 01:05:07.108
MATT: (ticking sound)

01:05:07.108 --> 01:05:10.393
SAM: Okay, I'll see if there's a way to disarm it,
or plug the hole, or something.

01:05:10.393 --> 01:05:14.057
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make a thieves' tools
check, which is your proficiency bonus plus

01:05:14.057 --> 01:05:16.263
dexterity modifier. Should be plus six, I think?

01:05:16.263 --> 01:05:17.449
SAM: 18.

01:05:17.449 --> 01:05:28.591
MATT: 18, okay. Looking at this central platform
here, as you inspect it, listening to where it's

01:05:28.591 --> 01:05:33.398
clicking, you listen for the holes that are
clicking. Most of these holes are not actually

01:05:33.398 --> 01:05:37.979
functional, they're just there to confuse whoever
might notice that there's an issue. Only one of

01:05:37.979 --> 01:05:42.124
them is active, and you listen very closely and
listen for the one that's making the clicking

01:05:42.124 --> 01:05:47.073
noise, and you quickly take one of your thieves'
tools-- or, not your thieves' tools, something on

01:05:47.073 --> 01:05:51.116
you that can plug that hole. A piece of stone,
something that you might have in your vicinity

01:05:51.116 --> 01:05:52.418
that might function to that degree.

01:05:52.418 --> 01:05:53.224
LAURA: A button!

01:05:53.224 --> 01:05:56.394
MARISHA: Ball bearings you stole from me.

01:05:56.394 --> 01:06:01.669
SAM: I do have ball bearings. Hold on, I have so
many things.

01:06:01.669 --> 01:06:03.793
MATT: (ticking sound)

01:06:03.793 --> 01:06:08.039
SAM: Oh god. I don't want to get rid of that,
that's cute. A vase!

01:06:08.039 --> 01:06:11.589
MATT: The holes are about that big.

01:06:11.589 --> 01:06:12.752
SAM: Ah, shit.

01:06:12.752 --> 01:06:15.868
MATT: (ticking sound)

01:06:15.868 --> 01:06:18.510
SAM: I take my brass doorknob and shove it in
there.

01:06:18.510 --> 01:06:22.954
MATT: Okay, there is a section of the doorknob
that will fit within that hole. You jam it in

01:06:22.954 --> 01:06:27.855
there, and you push and grind it in there until it
feels wedged in the stone, and eventually you hear

01:06:27.855 --> 01:06:37.529
(ticking) (swoosh) and the door knob cracks for a
second, and there's no more clicking. Apparently

01:06:37.529 --> 01:06:39.596
you have managed to break that device.

01:06:39.596 --> 01:06:41.407
SAM: I am going to take the doorknob back.

01:06:41.407 --> 01:06:42.811
MATT: As you pull the doorknob out--

01:06:42.811 --> 01:06:43.335
SAM: Shit.

01:06:43.335 --> 01:06:49.181
MATT: With disadvantage-- Oh, no that's a 12 to
hit.

01:06:49.181 --> 01:06:50.783
SAM: It shoots out anyway?

01:06:50.783 --> 01:06:53.754
MATT: It shoots out anyway, but haphazardly, and
then it breaks.

01:06:53.754 --> 01:06:54.354
SAM: Great.

01:06:54.354 --> 01:06:59.066
MATT: You hear a (clanking) on the inside of the
wall there, and that trap is busted.

01:06:59.066 --> 01:07:01.978
LAURA: Are there any more?

01:07:01.978 --> 01:07:08.280
SAM: I don't know! I check for more traps. Two for
investigation.

01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:09.620
MATT: Two for investigation?

01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:11.672
LIAM: Has the party held up at this point?

01:07:11.672 --> 01:07:13.512
MATT: You guys are all just in the back watching
this happen.

01:07:13.512 --> 01:07:15.288
SAM: I don't know how to be a rogue!

01:07:15.288 --> 01:07:20.573
LIAM: While that happened, I would like to
investigate the part of the room that I can see.

01:07:20.573 --> 01:07:22.241
Is there anything dangerous or hinky?

01:07:22.241 --> 01:07:23.369
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:07:23.369 --> 01:07:23.986
LIAM: Yes, thank you.

01:07:23.986 --> 01:07:26.187
SAM: I rolled a seven. That was not a two, it was
a seven.

01:07:26.187 --> 01:07:27.758
MATT: Okay, hard to tell at this point.

01:07:27.758 --> 01:07:29.475
SAM: Great. We're all clear!

01:07:29.475 --> 01:07:30.445
LIAM: 21.

01:07:30.445 --> 01:07:37.354
MATT: The chamber you're in right now? Looking
around, you can see a heavy layer of dust across

01:07:37.354 --> 01:07:39.269
the floor and the edges of the wall.

01:07:39.269 --> 01:07:41.019
LIAM: This is where Frumpkin is, correct?

01:07:41.019 --> 01:07:43.083
MATT: Oh! Sorry, I thought you were checking for
yourself.

01:07:43.083 --> 01:07:47.219
LIAM: Through Frumpkin's eyes. The half of the
room, or the portion of the room that Frumpkin can see.

01:07:47.219 --> 01:07:50.472
MATT: The portion that Frumpkin can see is just
the center platform. The center platform, looking

01:07:50.472 --> 01:07:56.339
on top, has a series of symbols on it. Looking
close, Frumpkin can see they aren't symbols that

01:07:56.339 --> 01:08:04.891
are drawn on it, they are carved in. Actually, the
triangular shape resembles that. The center hole

01:08:04.891 --> 01:08:13.322
is the deepest. It goes out of sight. The other
ones are just mild carvings in the stone.

01:08:13.322 --> 01:08:15.695
LAURA: Oh no, is this going to be a puzzle?

01:08:15.695 --> 01:08:16.254
SAM: I hope so.

01:08:16.254 --> 01:08:17.989
LAURA: Oh, fuck me.

01:08:17.989 --> 01:08:19.947
MARISHA: Definitely a puzzle.

01:08:19.947 --> 01:08:22.616
ASHLEY: So that's what's up ahead?

01:08:22.616 --> 01:08:25.807
MATT: Yeah, you guys are still back waiting for
Nott to finish walking through.

01:08:25.807 --> 01:08:27.317
ASHLEY: I'm just going to run across.

01:08:27.317 --> 01:08:28.397
MATT: You're just going to run across?

01:08:28.397 --> 01:08:29.613
ASHLEY: I'm just going to run across and pick up
Nott on the way.

01:08:29.613 --> 01:08:34.464
MATT: As you're like, "Coast is clear!" Yasha
comes rushing past. In the time that it's taken,

01:08:34.464 --> 01:08:39.900
the first trap has reset. That is going to be an
18 to hit?

01:08:39.900 --> 01:08:40.590
ASHLEY: Uh-huh.

01:08:40.590 --> 01:08:47.902
MATT: Ooh, that is 11 points of piercing damage,
as it strikes you in the back of the calf,

01:08:47.902 --> 01:08:51.680
actually piercing through the muscle, and you
stumble for a second. You rush past the floor

01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:59.163
where Nott is. No effect. The third one: it goes
off. Another trap. That is going to be a 14 to hit.

01:08:59.163 --> 01:09:02.773
ASHLEY: Yeah, that just hits.

01:09:02.773 --> 01:09:08.168
MATT: That's going to be seven piercing damage to
that one. This one catches you in the back, in the

01:09:08.168 --> 01:09:14.589
side of your rib cage, under your shoulder blade, and
you manage to emerge into the next chamber with

01:09:14.589 --> 01:09:16.158
the torch now. Wounded--

01:09:16.158 --> 01:09:16.658
ASHLEY: Fuck!

01:09:16.658 --> 01:09:21.469
MATT: But you made it through. They're both
sticking out of you as you turn around and look in

01:09:21.978 --> 01:09:22.916
the chamber.

01:09:22.916 --> 01:09:25.716
ASHLEY: Maybe nobody else do that.

01:09:25.716 --> 01:09:27.439
LAURA: No, I'm going to run.

01:09:27.439 --> 01:09:29.155
MARISHA: I feel like this is going well.

01:09:29.155 --> 01:09:30.636
SAM: I'm running.

01:09:30.636 --> 01:09:33.622
MATT: All right. As you guys run through, it's
still resetting. Who's going through?

01:09:33.622 --> 01:09:35.109
TALIESIN: I'm going for it.

01:09:35.109 --> 01:09:35.947
LIAM: Are we all going?

01:09:35.947 --> 01:09:36.770
TRAVIS: Ah! I'm running!

01:09:36.770 --> 01:09:38.031
LIAM: I'm holding onto Mollymauk and just
following.

01:09:38.031 --> 01:09:40.497
MATT: Who's holding up the back?

01:09:40.497 --> 01:09:45.640
MARISHA: I'll hold up the back. I want to look
around and see if I see anything that looks of value.

01:09:46.906 --> 01:09:49.599
MATT: Make a perception check with disadvantage,
because you're now outside of the main light. The

01:09:49.599 --> 01:09:53.168
rest of you rush through, making it through, the
traps have reset.

01:09:53.168 --> 01:09:57.572
MARISHA: I'll take that natural one and give
another $100 to 826LA.

01:09:57.572 --> 01:10:03.391
MATT: Beau takes a moment there. Looking around
the corners, it looks like this portion of the

01:10:03.391 --> 01:10:07.973
chamber is more of an antechamber or something
that leads into the next bit. There's nothing of

01:10:07.973 --> 01:10:08.966
worth or interest.

01:10:08.966 --> 01:10:11.457
TRAVIS: Yeah, just things to shoot you in the
fucking legs.

01:10:11.457 --> 01:10:12.772
MARISHA: Wait up for me!

01:10:12.772 --> 01:10:19.446
MATT: Okay. You run to the first chamber. It
shoots out towards you. That's cocked. That's

01:10:19.446 --> 01:10:21.418
going to be a 16 to hit?

01:10:21.418 --> 01:10:22.016
MARISHA: Miss.

01:10:22.016 --> 01:10:27.361
MATT: Misses. Just past you. The second platform,
Nott's already disarmed. No effect. Third

01:10:27.361 --> 01:10:32.353
platform. Does come shooting out at you. That is
going to be a natural 20.

01:10:32.353 --> 01:10:34.425
ALL: Ooh!

01:10:34.425 --> 01:10:35.751
MARISHA: I want to catch it.

01:10:35.751 --> 01:10:37.364
MATT: Okay! Let's see if it works.

01:10:37.364 --> 01:10:39.519
MARISHA: Knowing it's coming.

01:10:39.519 --> 01:10:41.074
LIAM: It's down low, though.

01:10:41.074 --> 01:10:43.567
MATT: 13 points of piercing damage for that one.

01:10:43.567 --> 01:10:46.210
MARISHA: 1d10 plus eight.

01:10:46.210 --> 01:10:47.989
LAURA: You can do it.

01:10:47.989 --> 01:10:48.796
LIAM: Get it.

01:10:48.796 --> 01:10:51.231
MARISHA: (groan) Wait, how many?

01:10:51.231 --> 01:10:52.034
MATT: 13.

01:10:52.034 --> 01:10:53.433
MARISHA: 11.

01:10:53.433 --> 01:10:59.634
MATT: 11. You catch it and it embeds itself about
an inch into your chest before you pull it out.

01:10:59.634 --> 01:11:03.127
MARISHA: I caught it! Argh!

01:11:03.127 --> 01:11:07.616
MATT: You throw the bolt to the ground and
continue on to the chamber. You only suffer two

01:11:08.038 --> 01:11:08.919
points of damage.

01:11:08.919 --> 01:11:10.945
MARISHA: Those are from earlier.

01:11:10.945 --> 01:11:19.209
SAM: I am so sorry. I did not handle that very
well. I was told to check for traps and I missed

01:11:19.209 --> 01:11:28.561
many of them and I will strive to do better in the
future and I'm sorry and this one, this one's on me.

01:11:28.561 --> 01:11:30.160
LAURA: It's okay, Nott.

01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:31.164
SAM: I'm sorry.

01:11:31.164 --> 01:11:34.802
LAURA: I pat your head. You know, it's a lot of
stress. You're learning still.

01:11:34.802 --> 01:11:40.143
SAM: It is! All these traps are different. I wish
they would just stick with the rope across the

01:11:40.143 --> 01:11:41.131
hallway trap.

01:11:41.131 --> 01:11:42.271
LAURA: Then the log coming down!

01:11:42.271 --> 01:11:45.015
SAM: Yeah. That's the one I know. It's a tried and
true classic.

01:11:45.015 --> 01:11:46.036
TALIESIN: It's classic, really.

01:11:46.036 --> 01:11:50.656
MATT: As you guys now have a moment here to take
in the chamber around you, Yasha holding the torch

01:11:50.656 --> 01:11:56.905
aloft, lighting up the vicinity. You're now
standing inside a tall, octagonal chamber that

01:11:56.905 --> 01:12:03.271
rises up about 25, 30 feet above you. A domed
ceiling with abstract designs and symbols written

01:12:03.271 --> 01:12:06.742
in each pie-slots of this octagon around.

01:12:06.742 --> 01:12:09.764
LAURA: We're at Burning Man, aren't we? We're at
Burning Man.

01:12:09.764 --> 01:12:10.416
MATT: No.

01:12:10.416 --> 01:12:12.157
TALIESIN: This is a great installation.

01:12:12.157 --> 01:12:17.829
MATT: You see in the center where all of these
triangular pieces of the dome meet in the center,

01:12:17.829 --> 01:12:23.458
there is a blue, thick ten foot wide pillar that
descends about ten feet from the ceiling, about 15

01:12:23.458 --> 01:12:27.868
feet above you. It's square and ominously held
aloft.

01:12:27.868 --> 01:12:30.576
LAURA: That thing's going to try to kill us.

01:12:30.576 --> 01:12:36.284
MATT: Below that, you see there is that triangular
piece of stone and there is no visible exit to the chamber.

01:12:36.284 --> 01:12:39.311
TRAVIS: Is that triangular piece of stone raised
off the floor?

01:12:39.567 --> 01:12:41.197
MATT: It's raised off the floor about a foot or
so.

01:12:41.197 --> 01:12:42.464
TRAVIS: How big is it?

01:12:42.464 --> 01:12:46.104
MATT: For each side, it's about two and a half
feet.

01:12:46.104 --> 01:12:47.528
MARISHA: It's this thing?

01:12:47.528 --> 01:12:48.470
MATT: It's that thing.

01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:49.967
SAM: How wide is the whole chamber again?

01:12:49.967 --> 01:12:55.447
MATT: The whole chamber would probably be about 50
to 60 feet wide.

01:12:55.447 --> 01:12:56.471
LAURA: Oh wow. It's big.

01:12:56.471 --> 01:13:01.277
TRAVIS: If we're just coming into the area, which
edge is pointing towards us? The flat or the point?

01:13:04.507 --> 01:13:08.959
MATT: From your perspective entering, this would
be the front end and there's these two sides

01:13:08.959 --> 01:13:14.159
there. You have the dome with all these symbols
and strange designs upon each of these eight

01:13:14.159 --> 01:13:15.846
pieces of the octagon dome.

01:13:15.846 --> 01:13:19.583
TALIESIN: Do I recognize any of these symbols?
Does anything look familiar?

01:13:20.463 --> 01:13:21.849
TRAVIS: From your brief life.

01:13:21.849 --> 01:13:24.122
MATT: What skills are you trained in?

01:13:24.122 --> 01:13:24.922
TALIESIN: Skills?

01:13:24.922 --> 01:13:25.791
MATT: Yes.

01:13:26.471 --> 01:13:28.225
LAURA: What skills you got?

01:13:28.225 --> 01:13:31.971
TALIESIN: I got acrobatics, insight, deception,
sleight of hand.

01:13:31.971 --> 01:13:37.685
MATT: Okay. What do you have? Proficient in?

01:13:37.685 --> 01:13:44.571
TRAVIS: (whistling) Going to have to get back to
you. Perception, intimidation, investigation.

01:13:44.571 --> 01:13:46.914
SAM: Yeah, there's a little dot next to it.

01:13:46.914 --> 01:13:49.253
TALIESIN: Investigation and survival also.

01:13:49.253 --> 01:13:52.255
LIAM: Arcana, insight, investigation.

01:13:52.255 --> 01:13:57.126
MATT: Well, as you look up. First off, as Yasha
holds the torch up so you can see the symbols.

01:13:57.126 --> 01:13:58.610
MARISHA: Oh shit.

01:13:58.610 --> 01:14:02.552
LAURA: What?! This is intricate.

01:14:02.552 --> 01:14:04.681
MARISHA: Look how cool!

01:14:04.681 --> 01:14:07.312
SAM: What are they? They're all over the ceiling?

01:14:07.312 --> 01:14:07.809
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:14:07.809 --> 01:14:14.377
LIAM: I have that kids' toy that makes these. You
spin it and the little pen goes around and around.

01:14:14.377 --> 01:14:17.336
LAURA: Are all those facing towards Fjord?

01:14:17.336 --> 01:14:20.081
MATT: All of these are from Fjord's perspective.

01:14:20.081 --> 01:14:22.387
SAM: Those are on the ceiling?

01:14:22.387 --> 01:14:24.640
MATT: Those are on the ceiling, yes.

01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:26.749
SAM: Let me just check for traps.

01:14:26.749 --> 01:14:32.157
I'm going to walk around the
immediate area checking for traps. 22.

01:14:32.157 --> 01:14:37.419
MATT: 22. As you slowly crawl your way around the
exterior, checking the stone, checking the

01:14:38.022 --> 01:14:41.542
placement. You do see that each of these symbols
are about maybe half an inch thick into there

01:14:41.542 --> 01:14:47.016
except for the centerpiece, which you cannot tell
how deep it is. The hole in the center goes down

01:14:47.016 --> 01:14:49.211
for a while, from what you can tell.

01:14:49.211 --> 01:14:50.949
MARISHA: You said this was pretty big.

01:14:50.949 --> 01:14:54.229
MATT: It's about two to two and a half feet 
to each side.

01:14:54.229 --> 01:14:57.773
LAURA: On the ground? Just on the ground?

01:14:58.359 --> 01:14:59.264
MATT: Yeah, flat on the ground.

01:14:59.264 --> 01:15:00.153
SAM: No traps?

01:15:00.153 --> 01:15:01.967
MATT: You do not see any traps around the interior
of the chamber.

01:15:01.967 --> 01:15:07.925
LIAM: Something was giving off an arcane aura
before we came in here, but I cannot see it now,

01:15:07.925 --> 01:15:11.166
so if you indulge me and give me ten minutes, I
will--

01:15:11.166 --> 01:15:12.427
SAM: Ten minutes?

01:15:12.427 --> 01:15:12.936
LIAM: Yeah.

01:15:12.936 --> 01:15:14.488
LAURA: Yeah, take your time.

01:15:14.488 --> 01:15:18.755
MARISHA: Can I do a check to see if I recognize
any of these things?

01:15:18.755 --> 01:15:20.485
MATT: Are you trained in arcana?

01:15:20.485 --> 01:15:24.763
MARISHA: I can use my mystical erudition to spend
a ki point.

01:15:24.763 --> 01:15:30.188
MATT: I will say because of your monk background,
I will allow you to go ahead and attempt it as

01:15:30.188 --> 01:15:33.925
well. If the two guys trained in arcana as well
are looking up at the symbols and studying them,

01:15:33.925 --> 01:15:35.280
you are welcome to do so.

01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:36.413
MARISHA: I get advantage on this.

01:15:36.413 --> 01:15:37.732
MATT: If you spend a ki point, yes you do.

01:15:37.732 --> 01:15:41.291
LAURA: Are the symbols just painted on the ground,
or are they carved into the ground?

01:15:41.291 --> 01:15:44.753
MATT: Those symbols are carved in the ground.
Those symbols on the ceiling of each space--

01:15:44.753 --> 01:15:45.959
LAURA: They're on the ceiling?

01:15:45.959 --> 01:15:50.476
MATT: They're on the ceiling in each octagonal
piece of the dome; they're painted above in a

01:15:50.476 --> 01:15:51.955
circle around.

01:15:51.955 --> 01:15:54.451
TRAVIS: 21.

01:15:54.451 --> 01:15:55.724
LIAM: 16.

01:15:55.724 --> 01:15:57.773
MARISHA: 18.

01:15:57.773 --> 01:16:10.162
MATT: Okay. In the focus of intending to cast the
Detect Magic spell, you're not as focused on the

01:16:10.162 --> 01:16:15.591
symbols. However, the two of you, keenly,
together, staring up at the ceiling, begin to make

01:16:15.591 --> 01:16:21.576
out something similar in these patterns. You don't
fully understand it, as it comes from whatever

01:16:21.576 --> 01:16:28.356
knowledge was imparted upon you from this entity
you've made a pact with. You, however, in studying

01:16:28.356 --> 01:16:33.985
various forms of the arcane and coming into
knowledge that isn't your specialty, but knowing

01:16:33.985 --> 01:16:40.192
it is definitely a specialty, you look at each of
these symbols, and these are not classically used,

01:16:40.192 --> 01:16:48.223
they're improvised interpretations, or specific
re-toolings of the symbols that mean each of the

01:16:48.223 --> 01:16:55.701
eight schools of magic. Between Fjord and Beau,
you guys get to make out what each of these

01:16:55.701 --> 01:16:56.600
symbols means.

01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:57.969
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

01:16:57.969 --> 01:16:59.591
MARISHA: Cool.

01:16:59.591 --> 01:17:06.065
TRAVIS: So I don't know why I know this.

01:17:06.065 --> 01:17:09.897
MARISHA: Yeah, it's like magic people code.

01:17:09.897 --> 01:17:10.852
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:17:10.852 --> 01:17:15.870
MARISHA: The people I learned from were super into
this shit.

01:17:15.870 --> 01:17:18.682
LAURA: Does that mean we have to cast some spells
or something?

01:17:18.682 --> 01:17:24.069
MARISHA: I think it's a puzzle. I feel like this
thing rotates and we have to match the symbols on

01:17:24.069 --> 01:17:30.570
the bottom to the symbols that match the school of
magic. It feels like the divination is a full

01:17:30.570 --> 01:17:32.244
symbol of the star.

01:17:32.244 --> 01:17:34.356
TRAVIS: It feels like the triangle is down here.

01:17:34.356 --> 01:17:38.646
MARISHA: Evocation, right? Then the diamond--

01:17:38.646 --> 01:17:44.030
LIAM: You can tell if you were to rotate it, it
would line up. Triangle to triangle, that would

01:17:44.030 --> 01:17:46.166
bring the star to that one there.

01:17:46.166 --> 01:17:47.266
MARISHA: What would the diamond be?

01:17:47.266 --> 01:17:48.456
LIAM: There's a diamond right there.

01:17:48.456 --> 01:17:49.612
SAM: Does it look like it goes inside?

01:17:49.612 --> 01:17:50.578
MATT: You can give it a shot if you want to.

01:17:50.578 --> 01:17:54.763
SAM: I'll go gingerly touch the base and see if it
moves a little bit.

01:17:54.763 --> 01:17:56.152
MATT: It does not shift at all.

01:17:56.152 --> 01:17:58.654
TRAVIS: Is anyone on the platform?

01:17:58.654 --> 01:18:00.055
MATT: Currently, no.

01:18:00.055 --> 01:18:03.972
LAURA: I wonder if you have to stick something in
the hole and twist it.

01:18:03.972 --> 01:18:05.446
MARISHA: I bet there's a key.

01:18:05.446 --> 01:18:07.608
LIAM: Caleb is still going through the ritual.

01:18:07.608 --> 01:18:08.231
MATT: Okay.

01:18:08.231 --> 01:18:11.707
TRAVIS: Fuck it, I'll stand up on the platform.

01:18:11.707 --> 01:18:19.128
MATT: Okay, you step onto the platform. A moment
passes. Two. No effect.

01:18:19.128 --> 01:18:21.474
TRAVIS: Can I look down into that black hole in
the center of it?

01:18:21.474 --> 01:18:25.431
MATT: You can, although in the light source
Yasha's currently holding, it just looks like shadow.

01:18:25.431 --> 01:18:26.492
ASHLEY: Do you want it?

01:18:26.492 --> 01:18:29.343
TRAVIS: I have darkvision. Oh, yeah, I'll take the
torch.

01:18:29.343 --> 01:18:33.351
MATT: Okay, you take the torch and hold it over to
give you a better glance over it. The hole

01:18:33.705 --> 01:18:36.243
descends about a foot and a half and stops.

01:18:36.243 --> 01:18:37.719
LAURA: Stick your wang in it.

01:18:37.719 --> 01:18:42.744
TRAVIS: I will put my finger in the hole,
actually. I don't know how big the hole is, but I

01:18:42.744 --> 01:18:46.480
want to feel if there are any grooves on the
inside or any sort of indentations.

01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:54.462
MATT: Right. It's roughly a half inch wide, so
about that wide.

01:18:54.462 --> 01:18:56.577
TRAVIS: I put my little pinkie in it.

01:18:56.577 --> 01:18:59.718
MATT: Fits inside.

01:18:59.718 --> 01:19:01.303
TRAVIS: Solid walls?

01:19:01.303 --> 01:19:02.913
MATT: Solid walls on the inside.

01:19:02.913 --> 01:19:10.769
TRAVIS: Well, it's short. There anything around
here that looks like a staff or a pole or rod?

01:19:10.769 --> 01:19:17.360
MARISHA: I'm going to start looking around,
digging, seeing if I see anything that looks like

01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:22.395
it would fit the shape. I'm also going to shout
out: Be careful, the shifty three were talking

01:19:22.395 --> 01:19:26.171
about an octagonal room where they got attacked.

01:19:26.171 --> 01:19:31.690
TRAVIS: The floor around this triangle shape, it's
flush in the ground, right? There's no circle

01:19:31.690 --> 01:19:33.755
around the triangle platform?

01:19:33.755 --> 01:19:35.295
MATT: Correct. It is just flush and set in the
ground.

01:19:35.295 --> 01:19:38.251
TRAVIS: So the ground's not going to move. Maybe
the ceiling has to move.

01:19:38.251 --> 01:19:42.978
LAURA: Oh, because of the thing in the middle.

01:19:42.978 --> 01:19:45.637
TRAVIS: Right. We're not going to be able to turn
the floor.

01:19:45.637 --> 01:19:47.250
SAM: How do we turn a ceiling?

01:19:47.250 --> 01:19:50.054
MARISHA: Maybe we've got to go all the way back up
to the top.

01:19:50.054 --> 01:19:51.302
TALIESIN: That's my thought.

01:19:51.302 --> 01:19:52.321
SAM: The top of what?

01:19:52.321 --> 01:19:54.413
MARISHA: The spiral staircase.

01:19:54.413 --> 01:19:56.428
ASHLEY: To see from the top?

01:19:56.428 --> 01:20:02.788
MARISHA: We need a down here team and an up here
team and maybe a Frumpkin to communicate through.

01:20:02.788 --> 01:20:07.450
LIAM: Well, I will remember this. I have a perfect
memory, I will remember this exactly.

01:20:07.450 --> 01:20:13.726
LAURA: Does the pillar coming out of the ceiling
have a hole in it as well?

01:20:13.726 --> 01:20:15.725
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:20:15.725 --> 01:20:17.197
SAM: She's good at finding holes.

01:20:17.197 --> 01:20:19.073
LAURA: I am really good at finding holes.

01:20:19.073 --> 01:20:20.613
LIAM: She talks about them a lot.

01:20:20.613 --> 01:20:21.614
LAURA: Yeah. 20.

01:20:21.614 --> 01:20:29.248
MATT: Glancing up at it, the pillar itself comes
down in a square-shape, and the very base of it

01:20:29.248 --> 01:20:34.891
has a slight curvature or dome to it, but it is
solid. You don't see any seams in it, you don't

01:20:34.891 --> 01:20:39.742
see any marking. It is just a solid pillar. It's
about ten feet wide or so.

01:20:39.742 --> 01:20:42.092
LIAM: Has ten minutes gone by yet?

01:20:42.092 --> 01:20:45.335
MATT: At this point, yeah, as they began to look
around. You said you're searching for anything

01:20:45.335 --> 01:20:46.112
else in the chamber.

01:20:46.112 --> 01:20:47.988
MARISHA: That looks like it would fit in the rod.

01:20:47.988 --> 01:20:50.488
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:20:50.488 --> 01:20:51.069
MARISHA: Okay.

01:20:51.069 --> 01:20:53.170
MATT: As you begin to slowly make your way around
the room, looking for any markings.

01:20:53.170 --> 01:20:54.470
ASHLEY: I feel like that goes in the hole.

01:20:54.470 --> 01:20:56.184
LAURA: But the hole is--

01:20:56.184 --> 01:20:57.609
SAM: This wide.

01:20:57.609 --> 01:20:59.060
LAURA: Yeah, the hole is--

01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:00.769
MATT: The hole is like a half-inch wide.

01:21:00.769 --> 01:21:02.126
MARISHA: Okay. 16.

01:21:02.126 --> 01:21:06.943
MATT: You spend a little while looking for any
signs of grooves or where anything's hidden. The

01:21:06.943 --> 01:21:11.071
chamber is solid, and there is nothing in the room
that looks like it would-- there's nothing to grab

01:21:11.071 --> 01:21:15.686
on to. There are no other objects in here. It's
fairly empty, aside from this dome, that octagonal

01:21:15.686 --> 01:21:21.284
shape, and this small engraving on the ground, and
that pillar at the top.

01:21:21.284 --> 01:21:25.263
TRAVIS: Caleb, do you have anything to draw these
symbols?

01:21:25.263 --> 01:21:27.992
SAM: Wait, Jester draws great. Jester can draw.

01:21:27.992 --> 01:21:32.218
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah! Jester, please, both of you,
yeah. Just to get a rendition of the ceiling in

01:21:32.218 --> 01:21:33.840
relation to the ground.

01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:40.134
LAURA: I open up my sketchbook and I start drawing
the symbols. Here, look, I made this beautiful picture.

01:21:40.134 --> 01:21:41.712
MARISHA: You work so fast.

01:21:41.712 --> 01:21:43.435
LAURA: Well, I'm really talented.

01:21:43.435 --> 01:21:45.908
TALIESIN: You don't have a heal cantrip, do you?

01:21:45.908 --> 01:21:47.146
LAURA: Cantrip? No.

01:21:47.146 --> 01:21:49.400
ASHLEY: I have some potions.

01:21:49.854 --> 01:21:52.736
LIAM: Did Detect Magic reveal what was glowing in
here before?

01:21:52.736 --> 01:21:59.389
MATT: No, this chamber is far further below. It's
40 feet below where you guys initially came

01:21:59.389 --> 01:22:03.159
through, so whatever you sensed earlier would have
been near where you entered.

01:22:03.159 --> 01:22:04.649
LIAM: Oh, it was just the glow stick.

01:22:04.649 --> 01:22:06.389
MATT: It was probably the glow stick, yeah.

01:22:06.389 --> 01:22:11.717
TRAVIS: I think maybe we need to see where those
stairs go up.

01:22:11.717 --> 01:22:17.056
MARISHA: The stairs are back through the hall and
up, right? They're not in these chambers? It's one

01:22:17.056 --> 01:22:18.580
big chamber?

01:22:18.580 --> 01:22:22.757
MATT: Nope. One big chamber with no other exit
beyond the hallway you entered from.

01:22:22.757 --> 01:22:24.841
MARISHA: All right, I'll jog up the stairs.

01:22:24.841 --> 01:22:27.089
TRAVIS: Wait. You're going to wait until she
disarms the--

01:22:27.089 --> 01:22:28.890
SAM: This is my chance for redemption.

01:22:28.890 --> 01:22:29.615
MARISHA: Oh, sorry.

01:22:29.615 --> 01:22:32.215
SAM: Let me break the traps first.

01:22:32.215 --> 01:22:33.466
MARISHA: Get it, girl.

01:22:33.466 --> 01:22:37.818
TRAVIS, MARISHA, and ASHLEY: (singing) Get it
girl, get it, get it girl.

01:22:37.818 --> 01:22:41.316
MARISHA: (singing) To the front, to the side, to
the back. Disarm that trap.

01:22:41.316 --> 01:22:44.082
SAM: Can I have a handful of ball bearings?

01:22:44.082 --> 01:22:48.160
TALIESIN: I hand Nott a handful of ball bearings.

01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:52.591
SAM: Thank you. I'll start working on it. I'm
going to disarm trap three.

01:22:52.591 --> 01:22:53.651
MATT: Go for it.

01:22:53.651 --> 01:22:55.421
SAM: 19, plus stuff.

01:22:55.421 --> 01:23:00.794
MATT: Oh, yeah. The next trap you come up to, you
leap up onto the side, using your fingers to dig

01:23:00.794 --> 01:23:05.646
into some of the holes there, and jam about three
ball bearings into the one hole that you see is

01:23:05.646 --> 01:23:09.367
the one where the bolt is actually embedded
within, and as soon as you step back down, you

01:23:09.367 --> 01:23:14.130
hear this grinding noise, and the trap is pretty
shattered from the inside.

01:23:14.130 --> 01:23:19.558
SAM: Okay, I'm going to go to trap one. Ooh, not
as good. Six plus six, right? 12?

01:23:19.558 --> 01:23:24.856
MATT: 12. The middle one is still broken. There's
only three platforms you've seen that actually

01:23:24.856 --> 01:23:28.651
lead to this trap. You've broken two of them. The
third and final one, you go to attempt to put the

01:23:28.651 --> 01:23:29.560
ball bearing in there.

01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:31.262
SAM: Oh boy.

01:23:31.262 --> 01:23:37.754
MATT: However, it does shoot forth, through your
thumb. That's going to be a 21 to hit.

01:23:37.754 --> 01:23:39.216
SAM: Oh, yeah, that hits.

01:23:39.216 --> 01:23:42.037
MATT: You take eight points of piercing damage.

01:23:42.037 --> 01:23:44.263
TRAVIS: Redemption is fucking painful.

01:23:44.263 --> 01:23:48.993
MATT: Actually, it goes through your thumb and
into your hand and into your wrist, and so you're

01:23:48.993 --> 01:23:53.845
bolted through there and it's sticking out right
there, and you're like (shocked sounds). The shock

01:23:53.845 --> 01:23:58.367
hits you-- you don't feel the pain yet, you're
looking at it jutting through your hand.

01:23:58.367 --> 01:24:00.409
SAM: (heavy breathing)

01:24:00.409 --> 01:24:01.960
TALIESIN: We can fix that.

01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:05.709
SAM: While it's reloading, I'm going to jam some
ball bearings in with my other hand and try to

01:24:05.709 --> 01:24:06.244
break it.

01:24:06.244 --> 01:24:07.763
MATT: Okay, go for it. Roll one more time.

01:24:09.433 --> 01:24:10.065
SAM: Nine.

01:24:12.245 --> 01:24:13.452
TALIESIN: Is that including the bonus?

01:24:13.452 --> 01:24:14.193
SAM: Yes.

01:24:14.193 --> 01:24:14.885
TALIESIN: Wow.

01:24:14.885 --> 01:24:19.213
MATT: You're having a hard time breaking it. You
hear the clicking going and you're putting the

01:24:19.213 --> 01:24:22.379
ball bearings, and they keep slipping back out,
and you can't find the right way to keep it in.

01:24:22.379 --> 01:24:24.287
You have too much pain from your hand.

01:24:24.287 --> 01:24:25.109
LIAM: She's too drunk.

01:24:28.249 --> 01:24:29.291
SAM: What else I got?

01:24:29.291 --> 01:24:33.447
MATT: (ping) Another one fires out towards you.
That's going to be a 13 to hit.

01:24:33.447 --> 01:24:34.287
SAM: Misses.

01:24:34.287 --> 01:24:37.049
MATT: So you duck out of the way. You attempt to
jam it back in.

01:24:37.049 --> 01:24:41.640
SAM: (frustrated growl) I'm going to try one more
time. Natural 20!

01:24:42.192 --> 01:24:43.611
(cheering)

01:24:43.611 --> 01:24:47.631
MATT: Angrily, with your one good hand, you take a
handful of bearings and jam them inside, holding

01:24:47.631 --> 01:24:52.894
your wrist there as you can feel the (impact)
inside, and then a spring breaks somewhere beneath

01:24:52.894 --> 01:24:55.229
the stone. All three traps have been disabled.

01:24:55.229 --> 01:24:56.326
LIAM: Sorry, 826.

01:24:56.326 --> 01:24:58.898
SAM: (relieved panting) All clear!

01:24:58.898 --> 01:25:02.607
TALIESIN: Oh, well done with-- oh my god, your
hand!

01:25:02.607 --> 01:25:06.835
SAM: It's fine, it's nothing. It's fine, it's just
a little blood.

01:25:06.835 --> 01:25:08.430
TALIESIN: That's-- ugh.

01:25:08.430 --> 01:25:09.773
LIAM: You want to deal with that right away.

01:25:09.773 --> 01:25:14.200
SAM: (pained groaning)

01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:17.308
MARISHA: Hey, can I keep that? I think I can throw
it later.

01:25:17.308 --> 01:25:18.601
LIAM: Yeah, here you go.

01:25:18.601 --> 01:25:20.308
MARISHA: Thank you. Thanks, Nott.

01:25:20.308 --> 01:25:22.184
TALIESIN: Did you just pocket a thumb?

01:25:22.184 --> 01:25:23.682
SAM: No, that's the bolt.

01:25:23.682 --> 01:25:27.223
MARISHA: Oh, sorry, here's your thumb back. I just
want the bolt.

01:25:28.693 --> 01:25:29.394
LIAM: Big Lebowski.

01:25:29.394 --> 01:25:31.616
TRAVIS: You want a toe? I can get you a toe.

01:25:34.746 --> 01:25:38.312
MATT: As you're bleeding profusely from your
wounded hand, you guys head up the stairway?

01:25:38.312 --> 01:25:39.693
MARISHA: Yeah, who's going up?

01:25:39.693 --> 01:25:44.576
LIAM: Well, here's what I think: I can send these
little globules of light quite a ways, and I can

01:25:44.576 --> 01:25:49.257
also send Frumpkin quite a ways, so why don't we
let Frumpkin have a look and we just hang back?

01:25:50.717 --> 01:25:54.466
TALIESIN: I think let's all head up in that
direction, but put Frumpkin first. I think

01:25:54.466 --> 01:25:56.276
Frumpkin ahead, but let's--

01:25:56.276 --> 01:25:57.254
TRAVIS: Ten feet ahead is fine.

01:25:57.254 --> 01:26:00.226
MARISHA: I have a feeling there's going to be a
lever-y or a move-y situation.

01:26:00.226 --> 01:26:03.681
TALIESIN: We're also going to have to keep
checking for traps and then we'll send people down

01:26:03.681 --> 01:26:04.905
when we need it.

01:26:04.905 --> 01:26:06.187
MARISHA: Yeah, you might need opposable thumbs.

01:26:06.187 --> 01:26:07.851
SAM: Hey! It's too soon!

01:26:07.851 --> 01:26:08.536
MARISHA: Sorry!

01:26:08.536 --> 01:26:12.898
TRAVIS: Yeah, we start heading up with Frumpkin
ten feet in front.

01:26:12.898 --> 01:26:21.247
LIAM: Let's say 30 feet in front of the group with
one of my Dancing Lights about ten feet behind

01:26:21.247 --> 01:26:22.738
her-- him? Him.

01:26:22.738 --> 01:26:24.739
MATT: Him. It's your pet.

01:26:24.739 --> 01:26:26.446
SAM: Wait, so who's going up?

01:26:26.446 --> 01:26:27.386
TRAVIS: Everybody.

01:26:27.386 --> 01:26:29.992
SAM: But who's going to be downstairs to--?

01:26:29.992 --> 01:26:31.607
TALIESIN: Well, we've got to figure out what we--

01:26:31.607 --> 01:26:34.251
LIAM: It's all right. Jester drew it, I remember
it, we're good.

01:26:34.251 --> 01:26:36.522
MATT: Marching order heading upstairs?

01:26:36.522 --> 01:26:38.740
MARISHA: I'll take the front.

01:26:38.740 --> 01:26:41.338
LIAM: I'll take second position.

01:26:41.338 --> 01:26:43.708
TALIESIN: I'll take third.

01:26:43.708 --> 01:26:46.032
ASHLEY: I'll take back.

01:26:46.032 --> 01:26:56.244
MATT: Yasha's in the back with Frumpkin up ahead.
Perfect. As you guys progress, spiraling up the

01:26:56.244 --> 01:27:02.869
staircase, you come by the glowing purple orb
that's embedded in the wall, and you're helping

01:27:02.869 --> 01:27:06.732
Caleb come up the stairs, vision currently focused
through Frumpkin. Frumpkin heads above, curling

01:27:06.732 --> 01:27:11.757
upward another 60 or so feet above where you
entered-- so 100 feet above, spiraling, where this

01:27:11.757 --> 01:27:20.858
base floor you had already inspected was.
Eventually, it emerges into a fairly wide

01:27:20.858 --> 01:27:21.775
square-looking chamber.

01:27:21.775 --> 01:27:23.514
LIAM: Looking for dangerous shit.

01:27:23.514 --> 01:27:33.791
MATT: All right. Frumpkin emerges and looks
inside. It's a Baroque-style grand chamber, with

01:27:33.791 --> 01:27:40.967
intricate designs and a beautiful interior. The
floor itself is solid marble squares that are

01:27:40.967 --> 01:27:49.043
off-color to each other and give almost a
checkered pattern to it. Against each wall, the

01:27:49.043 --> 01:27:54.099
walls are carved to be beautifully intricate with
half-pillars carved out of them, and parts that

01:27:54.099 --> 01:28:02.022
are inset with art pieces once were set, but are
gone. There are shelves in places in here, where

01:28:02.022 --> 01:28:10.507
things of worth were once set but have already
been taken. The opposite side of the room, by the

01:28:10.507 --> 01:28:16.152
way, has completely fallen in. This chamber should
be about 80 feet across, but it looks like

01:28:16.152 --> 01:28:20.450
something has happened and caused it to collapse
inward, and the chamber is slightly tilted to one

01:28:20.450 --> 01:28:26.764
side. There's a slight tilt, a decline towards the
left-hand side of the chamber. There are two

01:28:26.764 --> 01:28:30.452
load-bearing pillars that mark the center of the
chamber that lead up to the ceiling, and the

01:28:30.452 --> 01:28:35.725
ceiling itself is about 30 feet up, similar height
to the previous chamber you were in. Make a

01:28:35.725 --> 01:28:37.774
perception check for Frumpkin.

01:28:37.774 --> 01:28:40.790
LIAM: For me through Frumpkin is terrible. Seven.

01:28:42.470 --> 01:28:46.436
MATT: With the low light in the chamber, it's hard
to make out any of specific details beyond that,

01:28:46.436 --> 01:28:49.718
but this is what you can see. The collapsed
opposite side of the chamber that has fallen in,

01:28:49.718 --> 01:28:53.743
and there is rubble and stone and earth that has
filled the opposite side of the chamber. There is

01:28:53.743 --> 01:28:58.252
the nice marble floor and the designs and carvings
in the sides of it.

01:28:58.252 --> 01:29:01.501
TRAVIS: Is there any sort of door at the top of
the stairs that leads into this chamber, or is it

01:29:01.501 --> 01:29:02.069
just open?

01:29:02.069 --> 01:29:05.497
MATT: It just opens up. The spiral staircase just
emerges into that chamber.

01:29:05.497 --> 01:29:11.239
LIAM: Knowing distance, space, the direction of
north at all times, with Frumpkin in there, am I

01:29:11.239 --> 01:29:15.718
able to tell how far back we are from this
chamber? We're 20 feet back?

01:29:15.718 --> 01:29:18.731
MATT: You guys are about 15, 20 feet behind
Frumpkin, yeah.

01:29:18.731 --> 01:29:23.464
LIAM: Would you say that Detect Magic is still
cooking at this point? Are we still under the ten

01:29:23.464 --> 01:29:24.725
minutes from when I cast in the other room?

01:29:24.725 --> 01:29:26.772
MATT: You're getting close to the tip of it-- to
the end of it.

01:29:26.772 --> 01:29:28.244
LIAM: Am I sensing anything?

01:29:28.244 --> 01:29:29.928
LAURA: (snickers)

01:29:29.928 --> 01:29:32.831
ASHLEY: Just the tip of it.

01:29:32.831 --> 01:29:36.453
LIAM: Find one thing you're good at in life and do
it for the rest of your life.

01:29:36.453 --> 01:29:38.770
(laughter)

01:29:38.770 --> 01:29:39.706
LAURA: I'm sorry.

01:29:39.726 --> 01:29:41.459
MATT: So what are you doing?

01:29:41.459 --> 01:29:46.465
LIAM: I'm going to scooch-- well, no, I'm with
Beau, so I'm asking if I sense anything of arcane nature.

01:29:46.465 --> 01:29:50.473
MATT: Nothing in the vicinity of the spiral
staircase, no.

01:29:50.473 --> 01:29:53.571
LIAM: A retroactive question-- no, never mind.

01:29:53.571 --> 01:29:54.187
MATT: Okay.

01:29:54.187 --> 01:29:56.616
SAM: I'm going to pop a healing potion.

01:29:57.211 --> 01:29:59.075
LAURA: Oh, I can help you. You want me to heal
you?

01:29:59.715 --> 01:30:05.113
SAM: I mean, I don't want to impose, but I'm
bleeding profusely.

01:30:05.113 --> 01:30:07.040
LAURA: I'm going to cast Cure Wounds.

01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:07.817
MATT: Level one?

01:30:07.817 --> 01:30:08.365
LAURA: Yes.

01:30:08.365 --> 01:30:10.471
ASHLEY: She cast it on me, too?

01:30:10.471 --> 01:30:14.567
LAURA: I did it on you, too. So that's seven
points of healing for you.

01:30:14.567 --> 01:30:15.457
ASHLEY: Tight.

01:30:16.267 --> 01:30:19.071
MATT: Seven points for Nott? Okay, cool.

01:30:21.871 --> 01:30:22.985
LAURA: Does that help?

01:30:22.985 --> 01:30:24.109
SAM: It helps.

01:30:24.109 --> 01:30:26.436
TALIESIN: Still 11 down.

01:30:28.226 --> 01:30:31.227
MATT: Are you guys staying in the staircase or are
you emerging into the chamber?

01:30:31.227 --> 01:30:31.794
TRAVIS: I'm walking in.

01:30:31.794 --> 01:30:35.799
MATT: So you all begin to make your way inside
this chamber.

01:30:35.799 --> 01:30:38.284
LIAM: Anything arcane before it dips out?

01:30:38.674 --> 01:30:45.448
MATT: Nothing arcane in nature that catches your
attention immediately in a 30 foot distance. Are

01:30:45.448 --> 01:30:47.402
you heading into the chamber?

01:30:47.402 --> 01:30:49.406
LIAM: No. I'm behind Beau.

01:30:49.406 --> 01:30:54.857
MATT: Okay. Behind Beau, at the entrance way, you
don't feel any arcane presence. The rest of you

01:30:54.857 --> 01:30:58.070
begin to push past, and make your way into the
chamber. And once again you see--

01:30:58.070 --> 01:30:58.961
MARISHA: Any ghosty globbies?

01:30:58.961 --> 01:31:00.484
LAURA: Yeah, I'll looking for will-o'-wisps.

01:31:00.484 --> 01:31:06.558
MATT: That'd be perception checks from both you
guys. With Yasha's torch and the globes you have

01:31:06.558 --> 01:31:08.031
there, you don't have disadvantage.

01:31:08.031 --> 01:31:09.552
LIAM: I'm dropping Frumpkin vision.

01:31:09.552 --> 01:31:10.677
MARISHA: Natural 20.

01:31:10.677 --> 01:31:12.831
LAURA: Yes! That's real good.

01:31:12.831 --> 01:31:16.632
MATT: Natural 20. You?

01:31:16.632 --> 01:31:17.546
LAURA: Seven.

01:31:17.546 --> 01:31:19.525
LIAM: You're also good.

01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:21.412
MATT: Okay, you notice a couple things.

01:31:21.412 --> 01:31:22.048
MARISHA: Okay!

01:31:22.048 --> 01:31:28.562
MATT: One, there is a relief in the center of the
chamber, right before the wall collapse covers the

01:31:28.562 --> 01:31:37.944
floor built into the marble. It resembles two
faces and one body in the center. Like one torso

01:31:37.944 --> 01:31:44.136
leads into two faces that look upward. Their eyes
are gone, there's circular empty sockets where the

01:31:44.136 --> 01:31:49.943
faces are and their emotionless expressions
looking upward. Very thinly carved into the ground.

01:31:49.947 --> 01:31:51.049
MARISHA: On the ground?

01:31:51.049 --> 01:31:53.534
MATT: Yeah. Looking from above you can see it, but
looking from the side it looks very strange

01:31:53.534 --> 01:31:58.009
because it's a very flat carving. You see that in
the center, ahead in the chamber.

01:31:58.009 --> 01:31:59.898
MARISHA: Okay. Are they like profiles, or are they
front?

01:32:00.341 --> 01:32:02.721
MATT: No, they're looking straight up. There's two
sockets to each, and they're empty.

01:32:02.721 --> 01:32:06.027
MARISHA: Looking up, deadless? Okay. Copy.

01:32:06.027 --> 01:32:07.043
LAURA: Deadless?

01:32:07.043 --> 01:32:11.101
MARISHA and TRAVIS: Lifeless

01:32:11.101 --> 01:32:14.788
MATT: Yes. Deadless. Deadlifts, yes, they're
looking up from the deadlifts, it's--

01:32:14.788 --> 01:32:16.458
MARISHA: Sorry. Absorbing a lot at once. Keep
going.

01:32:16.458 --> 01:32:22.488
MATT: You do look to the right and left hand sides
of the chamber, you can see all the shelves and

01:32:22.488 --> 01:32:29.124
inset areas where artwork would have been placed.
You do see two upside down acorn-style alcoves

01:32:29.124 --> 01:32:31.645
that are mirroring each other on each side of the
chamber.

01:32:31.645 --> 01:32:33.095
LAURA: Does that look like that shape?

01:32:33.095 --> 01:32:37.702
MATT: From this distance, you can't see. They're
open. They're maybe about a foot tall and empty in

01:32:37.702 --> 01:32:41.113
the inside. With the light source you have at the
moment you can't see anything inside of them.

01:32:41.113 --> 01:32:47.744
Looking above you, you do see a set of chains that
are hanging from the ceiling that appear to be

01:32:47.744 --> 01:32:52.891
affixed to some sort of red clay urn or vase that
is dangling above.

01:32:52.891 --> 01:32:56.407
MARISHA: I relay all of that, of course.

01:32:56.407 --> 01:33:00.663
MATT: Looking across the way in the rubble,
because you rolled a natural 20, you see a faint

01:33:00.663 --> 01:33:04.231
glimmer of something metallic that catches the
light of the torch occasionally as Yasha moves

01:33:04.231 --> 01:33:04.961
back and forth.

01:33:04.961 --> 01:33:06.690
LIAM: You point that out as well?

01:33:06.690 --> 01:33:07.975
MARISHA: I do.

01:33:07.975 --> 01:33:12.838
LIAM: Off of her first comment I would send one of
the globules floating up to the ceiling to better

01:33:12.838 --> 01:33:14.840
illuminate what she's pointed out.

01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:19.909
MATT: Okay. It looks to be some sort of vase or
urn that is dangling from chains about 30 feet up.

01:33:19.909 --> 01:33:21.268
LAURA: How big?

01:33:21.268 --> 01:33:30.237
MATT: It's about that tall. The full container.
It's like a reddish clay color to it. It looks

01:33:30.237 --> 01:33:36.665
fairly well made, but nothing ornamental, per se.
It's dangling from a chain on each side. The light

01:33:36.665 --> 01:33:41.319
lifts around it to inspect and reveal its
coloration.

01:33:41.319 --> 01:33:47.490
LIAM: Was that 30 feet above us? Is there any
space between the ceiling and the container?

01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:51.573
MATT: About a foot, foot and a half. There's not
much distance. It's affixed to the ceiling right there.

01:33:51.573 --> 01:33:53.008
MARISHA: And we can see it-- sorry.

01:33:53.008 --> 01:33:53.810
LIAM: No, you're good.

01:33:53.810 --> 01:33:58.071
MARISHA: We can see a closer of the dome with the
symbols on them?

01:33:58.071 --> 01:34:00.766
MATT: There's no dome in here.

01:34:00.766 --> 01:34:04.180
MARISHA: Oh, we're not there yet. Sorry. We're
just up the spiral staircase.

01:34:04.180 --> 01:34:09.559
MATT: You're starting to enter the chamber, and
there is no ceiling shapes or anything that

01:34:09.559 --> 01:34:14.079
resemble the previous chamber you were in. It
comes to a-- there is a slight curve to where the--

01:34:14.089 --> 01:34:16.752
MARISHA: I'm assuming it's through the collapsed
tunnel. Right. Okay. Got it.

01:34:17.193 --> 01:34:18.775
LIAM: Something metallic in the rubble. Vase
above.

01:34:18.775 --> 01:34:24.239
MATT: Correct, and the two alcoves in the sides,
the two pillars that are load bearing in the

01:34:24.239 --> 01:34:25.271
center of the chamber.

01:34:25.271 --> 01:34:28.332
LAURA: Do you want me to throw something up at the
vase and try to knock it over?

01:34:28.332 --> 01:34:30.205
TRAVIS: No. Let's see what's on the other side of
the room first.

01:34:30.205 --> 01:34:34.925
LIAM: Just to clarify your description. The
container is being held from above?

01:34:34.925 --> 01:34:37.029
MATT: Correct. It is dangling from the ceiling.

01:34:37.029 --> 01:34:39.811
LIAM: Chains coming down? Or no, two chains from
the ceiling.

01:34:39.811 --> 01:34:41.788
MATT: Just two chains from the ceiling that are
holding it in place.

01:34:41.788 --> 01:34:43.597
MARISHA: That feels like that might be a trap.

01:34:43.597 --> 01:34:44.162
SAM: Yes.

01:34:44.162 --> 01:34:46.951
TRAVIS: Cool. I start walking towards the other
side of the room.

01:34:47.189 --> 01:34:52.450
MATT: Okay. Fjord, you walk through, the relief on
the ground ahead of you. And there is that weird

01:34:52.450 --> 01:34:56.987
source of metallic reflection that Beau had
seen from across the way.

01:34:56.987 --> 01:35:01.464
LIAM: I'm going to scoot up behind Fjord and see
if I can detect any arcane anything before the

01:35:01.464 --> 01:35:02.220
spell sniffs out.

01:35:02.220 --> 01:35:08.884
MATT: Okay. In the final throes of the spell, the
source of that metallic shine does give a faint,

01:35:08.884 --> 01:35:12.390
arcane, magical aura before the spell fades.

01:35:12.390 --> 01:35:13.310
LIAM: What kind was it?

01:35:13.310 --> 01:35:16.917
MATT: For that one? It would be abjuration.

01:35:16.917 --> 01:35:17.874
LIAM: Yeah.

01:35:17.874 --> 01:35:24.537
SAM: I'm going to scoot around the side and see if
I can peek into those holes. Those reliefs in the walls.

01:35:24.549 --> 01:35:26.357
MATT: The alcoves?

01:35:26.487 --> 01:35:27.492
SAM: Alcoves.

01:35:27.492 --> 01:35:30.792
MATT: Okay. You head over to the side alcove. Make
an investigation check.

01:35:32.712 --> 01:35:33.561
SAM: 16.

01:35:33.561 --> 01:35:38.614
MATT: 16. You glance up inside, it's about three
and a half feet off the ground, and you have to

01:35:38.614 --> 01:35:43.766
climb and scurry up with your small goblin body.
Looking inside, there is another clay urn of the

01:35:43.766 --> 01:35:47.374
same red color, that's set about a foot and a half
inside.

01:35:47.374 --> 01:35:50.532
LAURA: I'm going to get down on the ground.

01:35:50.532 --> 01:35:52.087
SAM: I will inform the others.

01:35:52.087 --> 01:35:53.673
TALIESIN: I'm going to go check out the other
alcove.

01:35:53.673 --> 01:35:57.557
MATT: The other alcove also contains a similar
clay--

01:35:57.557 --> 01:35:58.907
TALIESIN: Three red urns?

01:35:58.907 --> 01:36:03.030
LIAM: I catch Fjord by the arm. Be careful.
Whatever is under there is something of

01:36:03.030 --> 01:36:06.670
protection. Something to keep us out, or to
protect something.

01:36:06.670 --> 01:36:09.696
TRAVIS: The little metallic glimmer that we saw.
Can we see?

01:36:09.696 --> 01:36:19.988
MATT: As you approach, you can see, buried in some
of the rubble, a long brass or bronze rod of some

01:36:19.988 --> 01:36:22.254
kind. You only see about a foot of it sticking out
from under the rubble.

01:36:22.254 --> 01:36:24.061
LAURA: Ayyyy. There's a rod.

01:36:24.061 --> 01:36:26.595
TRAVIS: About a half inch in diameter, would you
call it?

01:36:26.595 --> 01:36:29.678
MATT: You get a little closer and look down at it.
It looks like it would be about a half inch in

01:36:29.678 --> 01:36:31.522
diameter, yeah.

01:36:32.019 --> 01:36:35.835
ASHLEY: What was underneath the urn in the
ceiling? On the ground?

01:36:35.835 --> 01:36:39.570
MATT: On the ground? There's nothing directly
below it.

01:36:39.570 --> 01:36:41.552
LAURA: Where are the faces on the ground?

01:36:41.552 --> 01:36:43.084
MATT: You walk up to the faces?

01:36:43.084 --> 01:36:43.473
LAURA: Yeah.

01:36:43.473 --> 01:36:52.114
MATT: You go over and sit over it, and you can see
a well carved, robed figure. Male on one side and

01:36:52.114 --> 01:36:58.535
female on the other, but the same features. Like
two sides of the same coin. Similar hairstyle. No

01:36:58.535 --> 01:37:04.090
coloration to it, but a white marble relief on the
ground. The torsos merge and extend on the two

01:37:04.090 --> 01:37:07.955
sides, and they both sort of look up with the
emotionless face. And where the eyes are they are

01:37:07.955 --> 01:37:09.935
vacant, circular holes about that big.

01:37:13.485 --> 01:37:15.503
MARISHA: Ooh. All of them?

01:37:15.503 --> 01:37:20.714
MATT: As you get closer and look, where the holes
are vacant, its only about maybe a quarter inch deep.

01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:22.785
LAURA: Whoa!

01:37:22.785 --> 01:37:26.772
MATT: So they don't go fully below, they're like a
quarter of an inch deep.

01:37:26.772 --> 01:37:29.361
LAURA: Should I stick something in these eyes?

01:37:29.361 --> 01:37:30.007
SAM: Maybe.

01:37:30.007 --> 01:37:38.060
ASHLEY: Is there any way to see what is in the
urns? Like just have a peeksies.

01:37:38.060 --> 01:37:42.597
MATT: You come towards the urn. You have to pull
it out slightly to look into it because the

01:37:43.072 --> 01:37:44.519
interior is too hard to see from this point.

01:37:44.519 --> 01:37:46.654
SAM: I'm going to get my crossbow ready to fire.

01:37:46.654 --> 01:37:47.028
MATT: Okay.

01:37:47.028 --> 01:37:50.678
ASHLEY: Can I just, with my sword, just a little.

01:37:50.678 --> 01:37:55.902
MATT: Sure. You take your sword and wedge it out.
It shifts forward a little bit and you look

01:37:55.902 --> 01:38:04.141
inside. It looks like there is ash in the urn.
It's only about halfway full. Make a perception check.

01:38:04.147 --> 01:38:11.881
ASHLEY: Uh-oh. Seven.

01:38:11.881 --> 01:38:15.208
MATT: All you see is ash inside the urn.

01:38:15.536 --> 01:38:16.836
ASHLEY: I think it's trash.

01:38:16.836 --> 01:38:18.741
TRAVIS: These are trash urns?

01:38:18.741 --> 01:38:19.221
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:38:19.221 --> 01:38:22.041
SAM: Why would they put trash urns in these
weird--

01:38:22.041 --> 01:38:22.915
ASHLEY: It's garbage.

01:38:22.915 --> 01:38:25.760
TRAVIS: Can I try and move some of the rubble off
of the bronze rod?

01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:31.557
MATT: Sure, start shifting some of the rock. Make
a strength check. This would be athletics to do

01:38:31.557 --> 01:38:32.839
this. Athletics, sorry.

01:38:32.839 --> 01:38:34.529
TRAVIS: Okay. I think that's a 15.

01:38:34.529 --> 01:38:40.246
MATT: Okay. You start shifting and pull the rocks
off. The rod begins to coil. You start moving it

01:38:40.246 --> 01:38:44.760
and you pull and manage to pull it free from the
stone. Some of the rocks falling down and

01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:50.559
stumbling to the side. You pull out a four and a
half foot long rod that is straight towards the

01:38:50.559 --> 01:38:54.567
bottom for about a foot and then is in a tight
coil to the very top where there is a small

01:38:54.567 --> 01:38:59.752
metallic knob at the very top. You pull it forth
and it vibrates a little from the impact of

01:38:59.752 --> 01:39:02.176
pulling it out from under the stone, and then it
comes to still in your hand.

01:39:02.176 --> 01:39:03.543
TRAVIS: Does it wobble?

01:39:03.543 --> 01:39:05.072
MATT: A little bit, very faintly.

01:39:05.072 --> 01:39:06.259
TRAVIS: Does it make any noise?

01:39:06.259 --> 01:39:07.598
MATT: No.

01:39:07.598 --> 01:39:10.857
TRAVIS: If I swing it harder, does it?

01:39:10.857 --> 01:39:12.230
LAURA: Don't break it.

01:39:12.230 --> 01:39:16.042
MATT: You start swinging it. It makes a (air
whipping) sound as you swing it around.

01:39:16.042 --> 01:39:21.027
LIAM: I think I would have noticed that the circus
bouncer looking in the urn did not get blown up,

01:39:21.027 --> 01:39:24.918
but also looked a little puzzled. So I'm going to
go over and take a look at the same thing.

01:39:24.918 --> 01:39:26.120
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a look at the other
one.

01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:30.510
MATT: Okay. As you go to look in the other urn,
you glance over at the urn that Yasha was turned

01:39:30.510 --> 01:39:36.506
away from, and you see this glowing fire emerge
from the urn in her direction. Just this small,

01:39:36.506 --> 01:39:40.266
glowing orb begin to shift out of the urn right
towards her back.

01:39:40.266 --> 01:39:42.125
SAM: Am I ready to fire?

01:39:42.125 --> 01:39:43.678
MATT: You are. You get to make an attack.

01:39:43.678 --> 01:39:45.225
TALIESIN: I'm going to start with one of my
blades.

01:39:45.225 --> 01:39:46.017
MATT: Go for it.

01:39:46.017 --> 01:39:49.307
SAM: Okay. I'm going to shoot a crossbow bolt at
that fire.

01:39:49.307 --> 01:39:49.961
MATT: Go for it.

01:39:49.961 --> 01:39:50.822
SAM: Natural 20.

01:39:50.822 --> 01:39:56.726
MATT: Oh shit. And that is a 19 against you Yasha.

01:39:56.726 --> 01:39:59.505
ASHLEY: Okay. Wait. Yeah, okay.

01:39:59.505 --> 01:40:02.824
MATT: Okay, do your damage.

01:40:02.824 --> 01:40:08.379
SAM: Okay. Is this sneak attack or no? I don't
even know what this creature is.

01:40:08.379 --> 01:40:09.548
LIAM: Yasha is right next to it.

01:40:09.548 --> 01:40:14.566
ASHLEY: Do I get a saving throw?

01:40:14.566 --> 01:40:18.735
MATT: No saving throw, but you do take 13 points
of lightning damage.

01:40:18.735 --> 01:40:19.525
ASHLEY: I'm going to die.

01:40:19.525 --> 01:40:22.948
SAM: I deal 16 points of damage.

01:40:22.948 --> 01:40:25.810
LAURA: Wait, do you double it because it's a
critical?

01:40:25.810 --> 01:40:26.333
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:40:26.333 --> 01:40:27.010
SAM: I don't know.

01:40:27.010 --> 01:40:30.161
LIAM: The dice are doubled. Not your modifiers,
but the dice.

01:40:30.161 --> 01:40:34.367
SAM: Wow. Okay. That's 28 points of damage.

01:40:34.367 --> 01:40:35.517
ASHLEY: That's better.

01:40:35.517 --> 01:40:38.543
MATT: 28 points of damage. All right.

01:40:38.543 --> 01:40:39.816
SAM: All the dice are doubled?

01:40:39.816 --> 01:40:40.386
LIAM: Yeah.

01:40:40.386 --> 01:40:41.143
SAM: Good god.

01:40:41.143 --> 01:40:46.272
MATT: So you actually take no damage, because he
was holding his reaction and as soon as it

01:40:46.272 --> 01:40:54.674
emerges, he fires. You watch as the orb
dissipates. The faint, little motes of energy

01:40:54.674 --> 01:40:58.055
shift and vanish on the outside of the urn.

01:40:58.055 --> 01:41:00.971
TALIESIN: I'm looking at the other urn. Is
anything happening?

01:41:00.971 --> 01:41:04.102
MATT: You watch as another one begins to slowly
emerge and another begins to emerge from the

01:41:04.102 --> 01:41:05.958
ceiling. I need you all roll initiative.

01:41:05.958 --> 01:41:07.387
MARISHA: Here we go.

01:41:07.387 --> 01:41:08.743
SAM: (shouting) No time to thank me.

01:41:08.743 --> 01:41:11.223
ASHLEY: Thank you.

01:41:11.223 --> 01:41:12.969
SAM: (shouting) No! No time!

01:41:12.969 --> 01:41:14.040
TALIESIN: Oh my god, really?

01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:14.527
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

01:41:14.527 --> 01:41:16.409
LIAM: I got another one for 826LA.

01:41:16.409 --> 01:41:24.761
TALIESIN: I rolled the same initiative.
This is the worst initiative ever.

01:41:24.761 --> 01:41:31.224
MATT: You got Yasha off to this side, going this
way. Nott, you're not too far from there. Molly,

01:41:31.224 --> 01:41:36.322
you were off to the opposite side to look to the
other edge. Caleb, where were you?

01:41:36.322 --> 01:41:39.935
LIAM: I was where Yasha was. I went over to look
at her urn.

01:41:40.414 --> 01:41:43.416
MATT: That's right. So you were over by Yasha.
Fjord, you were over by where you found the

01:41:43.416 --> 01:41:46.593
object. Frumpkin was-- ?

01:41:46.593 --> 01:41:50.844
LIAM: Frumpkin would have been just 15 feet into
the chamber.

01:41:50.844 --> 01:41:53.512
MATT: Okay. And then Beau and Jester, where are
you placed?

01:41:53.512 --> 01:41:55.594
MARISHA: I would be probably be in between Fjord
and Caleb.

01:41:58.694 --> 01:42:02.208
LAURA: I was wherever those bodies where, because
I was kneeling down and looking at them.

01:42:02.208 --> 01:42:12.159
MATT: Right. So that would be this relief right
here, by Fjord's. All righty. And you watch as

01:42:12.159 --> 01:42:16.429
Molly-- actually Molly was making his way over
there as this happened. And that one emerged.

01:42:16.429 --> 01:42:19.043
LAURA: It look like lightning corn on the cob.

01:42:19.043 --> 01:42:26.674
MATT: Another one shifts out of the urn that you
just had one emerge from.

01:42:27.326 --> 01:42:28.534
SAM: It's my own urn.

01:42:28.534 --> 01:42:33.464
MATT: That Nott has destroyed. It dissipated, then
the small motes (fwoosh) back into the urn.

01:42:33.464 --> 01:42:36.956
LAURA: Oh no! It's like never ending.

01:42:36.956 --> 01:42:39.223
ASHLEY: Now that I know it's there.

01:42:39.223 --> 01:42:41.454
LAURA: It's not a surprise, at least.

01:42:41.454 --> 01:42:42.883
ASHLEY: Not a surprise.

01:42:43.586 --> 01:42:46.275
MATT: So, going for initiative here folks. 25 to
20?

01:42:46.275 --> 01:42:47.032
MARISHA: 22.

01:42:47.032 --> 01:42:48.374
SAM: 22.

01:42:48.374 --> 01:42:57.945
MATT: Oh wow, all right. So we have Nott and Beau.
All right, 20 to fifteen?

01:42:57.945 --> 01:42:58.758
TRAVIS: 17.

01:42:58.758 --> 01:43:04.731
MATT: 17. We got Fjord. All righty. 15 to ten?

01:43:04.731 --> 01:43:05.406
LAURA: 12.

01:43:05.406 --> 01:43:06.420
ASHLEY: 10.

01:43:06.420 --> 01:43:13.654
MATT: Jester and Yasha. All righty. Ten to five?

01:43:13.654 --> 01:43:15.353
TALIESIN: Seven.

01:43:17.703 --> 01:43:19.707
LIAM: Rolled one, which makes me a two.

01:43:19.707 --> 01:43:21.178
MATT: Oh, Caleb.

01:43:21.178 --> 01:43:22.603
LIAM: I love it.

01:43:22.603 --> 01:43:26.541
MATT: All right, the will-o'-wisps rolled a 26 for
initiative.

01:43:26.541 --> 01:43:30.367
LAURA: These are the will-o'-wisps?

01:43:30.367 --> 01:43:32.084
ASHLEY: This is where we walked in from?

01:43:32.084 --> 01:43:34.300
MATT: Yes. That is the entrance where you walked
in from.

01:43:34.300 --> 01:43:34.825
MARISHA: Little shits.

01:43:34.825 --> 01:43:40.357
MATT: So for their turn they vanish temporarily.

01:43:40.357 --> 01:43:43.136
MARISHA: They what?

01:43:43.136 --> 01:43:46.990
LIAM: They vanish. They're gone. They're fucking
ghosts.

01:43:48.210 --> 01:43:53.374
TALIESIN: I'm trapped in that-- well, never mind.
Damn it.

01:43:57.484 --> 01:44:03.615
LAURA: Aren't will-o'-wisps like kids? Aren't they
the spirits of children?

01:44:03.615 --> 01:44:04.965
MARISHA: Is that true?

01:44:05.735 --> 01:44:08.845
SAM: Is that true? Oh god, that is awful.

01:44:10.255 --> 01:44:13.686
LAURA: That's what I learned in Quest for Glory:
Shadows of Darkness.

01:44:13.686 --> 01:44:17.219
MATT: You would know this, but it's different from
story to story. It's not necessarily the case

01:44:17.219 --> 01:44:23.646
here. So the three will-o'-wisps come back into
visual range, and one's going to be attacking

01:44:23.646 --> 01:44:25.851
Molly, one against Nott, and one against Beau.

01:44:25.851 --> 01:44:26.322
MARISHA: Copy.

01:44:26.322 --> 01:44:31.068
MATT: The one against Beau is going to be-- that's
a nine.

01:44:31.068 --> 01:44:32.739
MARISHA: <i>Nein</i>. Miss.

01:44:32.739 --> 01:44:37.916
MATT: That's a miss on you. It goes wide. There's
going to be one attacking you, Molly. That is

01:44:37.916 --> 01:44:39.879
going to be an 18 to hit.

01:44:39.879 --> 01:44:40.955
TALIESIN: Oh, that hits.

01:44:45.255 --> 01:44:52.582
MATT: That is eight points of lightning damage
against you. Against you, Nott-- that is a 22 to

01:44:52.582 --> 01:45:00.996
hit. You take 12 points of lightning damage. As
these will-o'-wisps reach out and strike you,

01:45:00.996 --> 01:45:06.401
there's a burst of energy as electricity,
strangely, like undead, life-sucking energy,

01:45:06.401 --> 01:45:10.147
electricity begins to shoot through your body. You
feel your muscles tense, your teeth and your jaw

01:45:10.147 --> 01:45:15.896
clench. And you break away and regain composure
for a moment, but they seriously hurt you with a

01:45:15.896 --> 01:45:22.634
brief gliding by your essence. For the rest of
their movement, this one is going to shift around

01:45:22.634 --> 01:45:27.918
this way. This one is going to go ahead and shift
this way. This one is going to go ahead and move

01:45:27.918 --> 01:45:34.797
right there, to melee move Fjord. All right, first
up we have Nott and Beau.

01:45:34.797 --> 01:45:37.018
MARISHA: Okay. You want to go first, girl?

01:45:37.018 --> 01:45:47.327
SAM: Sure! I will shoot towards (cocking sound).
Is the one near Molly engaged with Molly?

01:45:47.883 --> 01:45:48.553
MATT: It is, yes.

01:45:48.553 --> 01:45:53.325
SAM: Okay. I will shoot at the one next to Molly.
Not good, 12.

01:45:53.325 --> 01:45:59.248
MATT: 12? Does not hit, unfortunately. You fire
towards and it (swooshing sound) just dodges out

01:45:59.248 --> 01:46:02.879
of the way, completely avoids the bolt, as it
ricochets off the stonework in the distance.

01:46:02.879 --> 01:46:10.762
SAM: (cocking sound) Fire again, bonus action! Not
much better. 15.

01:46:11.298 --> 01:46:16.966
MATT: 15. It manages to arc out of the way of the
other one. Both bolts go wide from where its

01:46:16.966 --> 01:46:19.365
position is, striking the stone. No effect.

01:46:19.365 --> 01:46:20.862
LAURA: 15 didn't hit them.

01:46:20.862 --> 01:46:23.702
MARISHA: 15 didn't? Did you try to shoot it?

01:46:23.702 --> 01:46:24.406
SAM: Twice.

01:46:24.406 --> 01:46:27.148
MATT: Nott, are you going to move or stay there
for your turn?

01:46:27.148 --> 01:46:28.828
SAM: No, I'm engaged, right?

01:46:28.828 --> 01:46:29.373
MATT: Yes.

01:46:29.373 --> 01:46:34.109
SAM: I'm going to say, (shouting) Help me!
I'm going to die, I'm going to die!

01:46:34.109 --> 01:46:36.772
MATT: Beau, while this is happening, what are you
doing?

01:46:36.772 --> 01:46:43.206
MARISHA: Okay, seeing Nott have a hard time, I'm
going to pull out that holy water and I'm going

01:46:43.505 --> 01:46:48.428
to, like a confetti popper, I want to, right over
its face, just break it.

01:46:48.428 --> 01:46:49.588
MATT: The one right in front of you?

01:46:49.588 --> 01:46:50.040
MARISHA: Yeah!

01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:52.665
MATT: All righty, go ahead and roll an attack with
that.

01:46:52.665 --> 01:46:53.548
MARISHA: Just straight attack?

01:46:53.548 --> 01:46:55.072
MATT: It should be with your dexterity.

01:46:55.072 --> 01:46:58.659
MARISHA: With my dex, to throw it even though I'm
not throwing it?

01:46:58.659 --> 01:47:00.095
SAM: What are you throwing?

01:47:00.095 --> 01:47:05.563
MARISHA: I'm not throwing--the holy water. I'm
trying to break it with my hand and palm in its face.

01:47:05.566 --> 01:47:08.507
MATT: You're not proficient with it, but it's
still your dex to hit with it.

01:47:09.171 --> 01:47:10.316
MARISHA: 12.

01:47:10.316 --> 01:47:21.434
MATT: A 12? Okay, that-- pulling out a book here,
thank you for your patience, (singing) holy water.

01:47:21.434 --> 01:47:24.070
MARISHA: Is it a dex saving throw?

01:47:24.455 --> 01:47:29.856
MATT: That's a ranged attack against the target
creature. Yeah, no. You try to smash it, but it

01:47:29.856 --> 01:47:33.629
ducks out of the way. Because you're smashing it,
it doesn't hit the ground and shatter, so you

01:47:33.629 --> 01:47:37.821
still have it your hand. But you swing with it to
try to break it over this entity, and it dodges

01:47:37.821 --> 01:47:39.885
out of the way. They are very quick.

01:47:39.885 --> 01:47:43.014
MARISHA: Okay. Do I still get my bonus attack?

01:47:43.014 --> 01:47:49.302
MATT: Because it was a ranged attack, sure. It's
stretching it a little bit, but I will let it happen.

01:47:49.850 --> 01:47:54.764
MARISHA: Natural 19. 25.

01:47:54.764 --> 01:47:57.306
MATT: 25 does hit. Go ahead and roll damage.

01:47:59.526 --> 01:48:00.163
MARISHA: Eight damage.

01:48:00.163 --> 01:48:02.557
MATT: Eight points of damage for that one. Nice.

01:48:02.943 --> 01:48:04.362
MARISHA: Do I punch a ghost?

01:48:04.362 --> 01:48:11.002
MATT: You do hit it, but it doesn't take as much
damage as you would expect. As you swing toward

01:48:11.002 --> 01:48:15.368
it, it gives resistance to your fist, and numbs it
as you punch through it. It does react to the

01:48:15.368 --> 01:48:21.509
impact, but it's not quite as impactful as you
hoped a swing that strong should have been.

01:48:21.509 --> 01:48:22.176
MARISHA: Okay.

01:48:22.176 --> 01:48:23.113
LIAM: You punched cotton candy.

01:48:23.113 --> 01:48:25.896
MATT: You did, kind of-- stinging cotton candy.

01:48:25.896 --> 01:48:26.821
MARISHA: A little cold.

01:48:26.821 --> 01:48:27.797
MATT: Does that finish your turn?

01:48:27.797 --> 01:48:28.423
MARISHA: Yep.

01:48:28.423 --> 01:48:31.193
MATT: All righty. Finishing Beau and Nott's go--
Fjord, you're up.

01:48:31.193 --> 01:48:35.739
TRAVIS: I got a question. You said ten minutes on
the boat as we were moving forward, ten minutes

01:48:35.739 --> 01:48:40.243
for him to cast detect magic, and another ten
minutes for detect magic to run out, so it's been

01:48:40.243 --> 01:48:40.972
about a half an hour?

01:48:40.972 --> 01:48:44.265
MATT: I'd say with searching around everything,
it's been closer to 45 minutes.

01:48:44.803 --> 01:48:46.279
TRAVIS: Okay, great. So my Armor of Agathys is
still up?

01:48:46.279 --> 01:48:46.907
MATT: Your armor is still up.

01:48:46.907 --> 01:48:55.207
TRAVIS: So can I bonus-action Hex the glob-- the
wispy thing right next to me?

01:48:55.207 --> 01:48:59.726
MATT: Sure. There we go.

01:49:00.313 --> 01:49:01.090
TRAVIS: Nice.

01:49:01.090 --> 01:49:01.883
MATT: You've hexed it.

01:49:01.883 --> 01:49:06.064
TRAVIS: Great. Can I take swipe at it with
the Wastehunter Blade?

01:49:06.064 --> 01:49:08.054
SAM: Wastehunter!

01:49:08.054 --> 01:49:12.425
TRAVIS: Wastehunter. That is 15 to hit.

01:49:12.425 --> 01:49:16.938
MATT: 15 to hit. You Hex it and as you swing your
blade, (swooshing sound) it shimmies out of the

01:49:16.938 --> 01:49:21.685
way. Its light moves with sudden, rapid haste as
soon as you try to strike towards it and dodges

01:49:21.685 --> 01:49:22.793
the blow entirely.

01:49:22.793 --> 01:49:30.027
TRAVIS: Wow! Can I use all of my 30 foot walking
speed to run towards the door there where we came

01:49:30.561 --> 01:49:31.425
out of.

01:49:31.425 --> 01:49:37.142
MATT: All right. Ten, 15, 20, 25, 30. The one that
was near you is going to go ahead and make an

01:49:37.142 --> 01:49:38.699
opportunity strike against you.

01:49:38.699 --> 01:49:41.314
MARISHA: Does that mean I get to make an
opportunity strike against it?

01:49:41.314 --> 01:49:43.674
MATT: It made an attack that doesn't include you,
so yeah, technically.

01:49:43.674 --> 01:49:44.526
SAM: Wow!

01:49:44.526 --> 01:49:46.068
TRAVIS: That is the plan here.

01:49:46.068 --> 01:49:47.877
MATT: All right, so that is an 18 to hit you.

01:49:47.877 --> 01:49:48.415
TRAVIS: It hits.

01:49:48.415 --> 01:49:49.120
MATT: All right.

01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:51.472
TRAVIS: And it take ten points of cold damage.

01:49:51.472 --> 01:49:53.979
MATT: And you take ten points of lightning
damage.

01:49:53.979 --> 01:49:54.597
TRAVIS: Beautiful.

01:49:54.597 --> 01:49:56.158
MARISHA: That's okay, that's okay.

01:49:56.158 --> 01:50:01.657
MATT: Cold damage, all right. So it takes-- the
cold does not seem to impact it as heavily as you

01:50:01.657 --> 01:50:06.411
would assume. It does hurt it, but it seems to be
resistant from a lot of the forms of attacks that

01:50:06.411 --> 01:50:08.270
you are throwing in its direction.

01:50:08.270 --> 01:50:08.756
MARISHA: 21.

01:50:08.756 --> 01:50:10.295
MATT: That hits. Roll damage.

01:50:10.295 --> 01:50:11.605
MARISHA: Another eight points.

01:50:11.605 --> 01:50:17.570
MATT: Another fist punch towards the will-o'-wisp
impacts, but doesn't seem to strike as strong as

01:50:17.570 --> 01:50:23.446
you hoped, but it's still taking damage as it runs
past. It shocks out at Fjord as Fjord runs by.

01:50:23.446 --> 01:50:26.687
Using your Sentinel feat to get your reaction hit
off.

01:50:26.687 --> 01:50:28.827
TRAVIS: I've got that gold rod, by the way. I'm
getting the fuck out of here.

01:50:28.827 --> 01:50:29.612
MARISHA: Yeah, go.

01:50:29.612 --> 01:50:34.010
MATT: That ends Fjord's turn. Jester, you're up.

01:50:34.010 --> 01:50:41.977
LAURA: Okay. As a bonus action, I'm going to cast
Sanctuary on Nott.

01:50:41.977 --> 01:50:46.420
SAM: Oh, I feel so safe.

01:50:46.420 --> 01:50:49.507
MATT: That's concentration or not?

01:50:49.507 --> 01:50:53.733
LAURA: It doesn't say concentration.

01:50:53.733 --> 01:50:56.704
MATT: Okay, I'll pull it up.

01:50:57.208 --> 01:50:59.028
LAURA: It doesn't have that on the--

01:50:59.028 --> 01:51:02.273
MATT: Sanctuary is not concentration.

01:51:02.273 --> 01:51:16.165
LAURA: They have to make a wisdom save if they
attack her. Then as an action, I'm going to use my

01:51:16.165 --> 01:51:19.818
cantrip of Sacred Flame.

01:51:19.818 --> 01:51:21.819
MATT: Against which one?

01:51:21.819 --> 01:51:25.094
LAURA: The one next to Molly.

01:51:25.094 --> 01:51:27.355
MATT: Next to Molly. That's a wisdom save?

01:51:27.355 --> 01:51:29.406
LAURA: No, it's a dex save.

01:51:29.406 --> 01:51:33.068
MATT: That is a 23.

01:51:33.068 --> 01:51:35.142
LAURA: It definitely saves.

01:51:35.142 --> 01:51:40.600
MATT: It ducks out of the way before the Sacred
Flame bursts into the air, hitting nothing. You

01:51:40.600 --> 01:51:45.368
get the sense through all these attacks that these
things are very quick. That end your turn, Jester?

01:51:45.368 --> 01:51:47.281
That brings us to Yasha.

01:51:47.281 --> 01:51:50.256
SAM: Come on, Yasha! Hurt them with your
strength!

01:51:50.256 --> 01:51:55.075
ASHLEY: I'm going to get a little closer to the
one that's near Nott.

01:51:59.465 --> 01:52:01.664
MATT: With your greatsword--

01:52:01.664 --> 01:52:10.617
ASHLEY: Pulled out, so I would like to rage. You
can use reckless while you're raging?

01:52:10.617 --> 01:52:11.921
MATT: Reckless attacks? Yeah.

01:52:11.921 --> 01:52:15.036
TRAVIS: Which means you roll with advantage, but
they get advantage on you.

01:52:15.569 --> 01:52:16.767
ASHLEY: Okay, that's fine.

01:52:16.767 --> 01:52:20.802
LIAM: (singing) Fuck you, I won't do what you tell
me!

01:52:20.802 --> 01:52:26.249
ASHLEY: I want to get this all figured out so we
won't always have question time. Can I also use

01:52:26.249 --> 01:52:27.626
Divine Fury?

01:52:27.626 --> 01:52:32.565
MATT: Divine Fury? Yeah, that's part of your
thing, so all that happens at the same time. Your

01:52:32.565 --> 01:52:34.370
first attack every round.

01:52:34.370 --> 01:52:37.450
ASHLEY: So I roll twice?

01:52:37.450 --> 01:52:40.460
MATT: You roll twice, take the higher of the two.

01:52:42.520 --> 01:52:43.163
TALIESIN: Wow!

01:52:43.163 --> 01:52:45.086
LIAM: Go for that natural 20!

01:52:48.716 --> 01:52:49.324
ASHLEY: 25?

01:52:49.324 --> 01:52:52.919
MATT: 25 definitely hits. You do the damage from
your sword.

01:52:52.919 --> 01:52:56.092
ASHLEY: Ah! What do I--

01:52:56.092 --> 01:53:05.832
MATT: The greatsword is 2d6 plus your strength
modifier, which is three? Plus your rage modifier,

01:53:06.348 --> 01:53:11.690
which is two? That's plus five to whatever you
roll, plus your Divine Fury damage.

01:53:11.690 --> 01:53:13.398
LIAM: Fucking muscle wizards.

01:53:13.398 --> 01:53:16.698
ASHLEY: Plus what? Say again?

01:53:16.698 --> 01:53:20.732
MATT: Whatever you roll, plus five. Ten, plus your
Divine Fury.

01:53:20.732 --> 01:53:24.578
ASHLEY: Which is another d6, plus half--

01:53:28.238 --> 01:53:29.963
SAM: Just pull out another d6.

01:53:29.963 --> 01:53:36.391
ASHLEY: I don't want to. (counting) 18.

01:53:36.391 --> 01:53:40.759
MATT: Well, how much radiant damage is that?

01:53:41.258 --> 01:53:42.504
TRAVIS: Plus half your barbarian level?

01:53:42.504 --> 01:53:43.654
LAURA: She rolled six.

01:53:43.654 --> 01:53:52.385
ASHLEY: The damage that I chose was necrotic. Six
plus half my barbarian level, which would be two,

01:53:52.385 --> 01:53:54.687
so 18 damage.

01:53:54.687 --> 01:54:02.003
MATT: You rush forward, rage, giant swing down
with your blade. You watch this burst of dark

01:54:02.003 --> 01:54:07.028
necrotic energy come crackling out of the blow. It
hits, and you watch as it flickers for a second,

01:54:07.028 --> 01:54:12.040
and pulls itself back together. It's wounded, but
it seems to be shrugging off some of the impact

01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:17.380
barely. You want to stay where you are?

01:54:17.380 --> 01:54:25.457
ASHLEY: Bonus attack? Not bonus, but do I have a
bonus? Can I do Healing Hands on Nott?

01:54:25.457 --> 01:54:27.095
MATT: You bonus raged, unfortunately.

01:54:27.095 --> 01:54:30.587
ASHLEY: Oh, that's your bonus. Copy that. Got it.

01:54:30.587 --> 01:54:32.184
MATT: That's your turn, Yasha?

01:54:32.184 --> 01:54:35.247
ASHLEY: Yep, that's my turn. Wait-- yes, I'm going
to stay there.

01:54:39.267 --> 01:54:40.509
TALIESIN: I know what these things are.

01:54:40.509 --> 01:54:41.004
MATT: Yes.

01:54:41.004 --> 01:54:46.152
TALIESIN: Do I understand what's happening, with
why they're going back to the pots, to whatever's

01:54:46.152 --> 01:54:47.961
in the pots?

01:54:47.961 --> 01:54:52.353
MATT: You're not entirely certain, but you do
notice, glancing about, that they seem to be

01:54:52.353 --> 01:54:53.469
emerging from them.

01:54:53.469 --> 01:54:56.206
TALIESIN: I'm actively tracking these at this
point, I would imagine, so I can't be surprised anymore.

01:54:56.206 --> 01:54:57.053
MATT: Right.

01:54:57.053 --> 01:55:02.254
TALIESIN: All right. Can I scoot around the-- I
assume the clay pot is on the other side of that

01:55:02.762 --> 01:55:03.417
will-o'-wisp right now?

01:55:03.417 --> 01:55:04.056
MATT: It is.

01:55:04.056 --> 01:55:05.162
TALIESIN: I'm going to scoot around to that side.

01:55:05.162 --> 01:55:05.730
MATT: Okay.

01:55:05.730 --> 01:55:08.702
TALIESIN: I'm going to take my first shot at the
will-o'-wisp as I'm dancing around it.

01:55:08.702 --> 01:55:10.729
MATT: All righty. You swing wide with your first.

01:55:10.729 --> 01:55:14.317
TALIESIN: Yeah, let's see if this hits. 17?

01:55:14.317 --> 01:55:15.607
MATT: 17 does not hit.

01:55:15.607 --> 01:55:16.848
TALIESIN: My god, really?!

01:55:16.848 --> 01:55:20.139
MATT: You swing your blade and it ducks out of the
way. These are quick little fuckers!

01:55:20.139 --> 01:55:23.324
TALIESIN: I'm going to take my bonus action, and
I'm going to break the pot.

01:55:23.324 --> 01:55:24.890
MATT: Okay. Swing.

01:55:24.890 --> 01:55:27.516
SAM: Taliesin hates pot!

01:55:27.516 --> 01:55:29.427
TALIESIN: Yes, I do. 11 points.

01:55:29.427 --> 01:55:33.530
MATT: 11 is enough. It's a stationary object. So
roll damage on it.

01:55:33.530 --> 01:55:38.030
TALIESIN: All right, that's eight points of
damage.

01:55:38.030 --> 01:55:42.520
MATT: Eight points of damage. You bring the blade
in and strike into the alcove, and as you yank it

01:55:42.520 --> 01:55:49.584
out with the blade, you cut it halfway through the
air. The actual urn bisects, sending ash clouding

01:55:49.584 --> 01:55:53.909
into the air around you, and you watch as the
will-o'-wisp (pfft).

01:55:53.909 --> 01:55:56.321
SAM: Oh! Why don't we do that with all of them?

01:55:56.321 --> 01:55:57.640
MARISHA: Nice! That's what we do!

01:55:57.640 --> 01:56:00.079
TRAVIS: Nice, dude, nice.

01:56:00.079 --> 01:56:04.947
MATT: The urn clatters to the ground. The top of
it breaks, the second half hits with a heavy thud

01:56:04.947 --> 01:56:10.337
sound that's different from the sound of the clay
that shatters on the ground. That finishes your turn?

01:56:10.337 --> 01:56:14.025
TALIESIN: Other than that I'm going to take a look
at it down below, to see if there's anything in

01:56:14.025 --> 01:56:14.936
there that's weird.

01:56:14.936 --> 01:56:20.512
MATT: I'll say you have to wait until next round. You
reach around and finish that whirling dervish action.

01:56:20.512 --> 01:56:23.036
LAURA: I should have thrown something at the
vase!

01:56:23.036 --> 01:56:24.245
SAM: Yeah!

01:56:24.245 --> 01:56:25.686
MATT: Caleb, you're up.

01:56:25.686 --> 01:56:33.581
LIAM: Caleb does what that bearded dude in the GIF
does, going-- seeing that happen, and I cast

01:56:34.208 --> 01:56:38.628
Scorching Ray myself, and I will send one ball of
fire at the next pot.

01:56:38.628 --> 01:56:39.348
MATT: All righty.

01:56:39.348 --> 01:56:41.354
TALIESIN: The one on the roof?

01:56:41.354 --> 01:56:45.776
LIAM: No, the other one besides that.

01:56:45.776 --> 01:56:47.477
MATT: The one in this alcove there that's right
across the way?

01:56:47.477 --> 01:56:55.699
LIAM: Yeah. That is-- oh, jeez. Everything changed
for me. So that is perception plus-- not

01:56:55.699 --> 01:57:01.040
perception. Intelligence modifier, which is five
plus seven. So that is an 18 to hit.

01:57:01.040 --> 01:57:02.918
MATT: 18 hits, yeah. Roll damage on that one.

01:57:02.918 --> 01:57:07.142
LIAM: Okay, that's 2d6 for a damage of seven.

01:57:07.142 --> 01:57:12.981
MATT: Seven. That urn explodes on the inside of
the alcove as the streaking, hot Scorching Ray

01:57:12.981 --> 01:57:17.555
slams into the clay, causing the top half of it to
detonate. The bottom half of the clay cracks, and

01:57:17.555 --> 01:57:23.752
the bottom still remains in place, the ash
clouding out of it. The one--

01:57:23.752 --> 01:57:27.493
LIAM: So that did not get destroyed, then, it got
damaged?

01:57:27.493 --> 01:57:32.630
MATT: This will-o'-wisp flickers out. It had been
heavily damaged already, and that amount of

01:57:32.630 --> 01:57:35.953
scattering of the ash caused it to flicker and
disintegrate. The bottom of the urn is still

01:57:35.953 --> 01:57:39.035
holding itself in place, the top half scattered
and broken.

01:57:39.035 --> 01:57:42.176
LIAM: That was just one, so I continue to wrap my
hand around, and a second one shoots out at the

01:57:42.176 --> 01:57:45.148
one in the ceiling. That is a natural 18.

01:57:45.148 --> 01:57:46.779
MATT: That hits. Roll damage on that one.

01:57:46.779 --> 01:57:49.820
LIAM: Yeah. That is an eight.

01:57:49.820 --> 01:57:57.307
MATT: Eight? It shatters and breaks. The ash comes
clouding down like the slight drizzle of soft dust

01:57:57.307 --> 01:58:02.328
and ash. This will-o'-wisp vanishes into the
space.

01:58:02.328 --> 01:58:03.544
TRAVIS: Ugh, it's in my eyebrows!

01:58:03.544 --> 01:58:09.097
LIAM: The other one shoots up in the air and lands
two feet behind me, just goes (explosion).

01:58:09.097 --> 01:58:10.626
SAM: Whoa, so cool!

01:58:10.626 --> 01:58:12.842
MATT: As you're three-point landing there,
Caleb--

01:58:12.842 --> 01:58:13.968
LIAM: No, I'm standing!

01:58:13.968 --> 01:58:18.860
MATT: Standing, but hurling a-- (laughter) As you
stand there, the explosion behind from the

01:58:18.860 --> 01:58:24.969
Scorching Ray, as the bottom half of the urn from
the ceiling-- (tinging, rolling)

01:58:24.969 --> 01:58:26.592
LIAM: Oh shit, that's hot!

01:58:26.592 --> 01:58:28.960
SAM: That was amazing!

01:58:28.960 --> 01:58:32.382
TALIESIN: I'm going to pick up the bottom half of
that, and I'm going to examine, immediately, what

01:58:32.382 --> 01:58:32.794
I've got.

01:58:32.794 --> 01:58:37.792
MATT: All right. And we'll come back to that after
our break because it's just after nine o'clock. So

01:58:37.792 --> 01:58:42.579
we'll take a quick break here and be back here in
just a moment, guys. Hold tight. In the meantime,

01:58:42.579 --> 01:58:48.315
we do have another Wyrmwood giveaway. We have a
black poisonwood Hero Vault that we're giving out

01:58:48.315 --> 01:58:55.660

01:58:55.660 --> 01:59:00.269

at the break! We'll see you guys in a minute.

01:59:16.381 --> 02:16:50.729
[break]

02:16:51.351 --> 02:16:56.083
MATT: Hello, and welcome back everybody! Glad we
can join... us. Before we get back into the story,

02:16:56.083 --> 02:17:01.507
we have a winner. The winner for tonight's
giveaway is TheMostJost!

02:17:01.507 --> 02:17:03.655
TRAVIS: TheMostJost!

02:17:03.655 --> 02:17:09.029
MATT: You are the most jostiest Jost, and as such,
being the most jostest, TheMostJost, you win.

02:17:09.029 --> 02:17:16.222
Congratulations, we're going to get that black
poisonwood Hero's Vault to you, so congrats.

02:17:19.242 --> 02:17:25.713
The brief burst of adrenaline has begun to fade from
your bodies, your muscles tense, slowly beginning

02:17:25.713 --> 02:17:32.251
to relax. The urn shattered, the chamber now still
and quiet. No seeming flickering flame of undead

02:17:32.251 --> 02:17:37.047
energy or source in the vicinity. What do you want
to do?

02:17:37.047 --> 02:17:42.363
LAURA: Those guys were so stupid. They could have
broken the vases. How dumb are they?

02:17:42.403 --> 02:17:45.692
MARISHA: I know. I don't feel so bad for making
fun of them now. I feel like maybe we were hard on

02:17:45.692 --> 02:17:47.431
them, but now I don't think we were.

02:17:47.431 --> 02:17:50.387
TRAVIS: No, I don't think so either. They're
fucking ceramic pottery pieces.

02:17:50.387 --> 02:17:52.661
SAM: I'm <i>desperately</i> injured.

02:17:52.661 --> 02:17:54.925
LAURA: You want me to try to heal you?

02:17:54.925 --> 02:17:58.271
SAM: No. Again, I don't want to impose.

02:17:58.271 --> 02:17:59.693
LAURA: I'll try to heal you.

02:17:59.693 --> 02:18:04.528
SAM: If you're offering, I'll take it, but I am
<i>definitely</i> bleeding from my eyes.

02:18:04.528 --> 02:18:10.156
LAURA: I'm going to cast, at a 2nd-level, Cure
Wounds, because Nott seems like she's dying.

02:18:10.233 --> 02:18:11.940
LIAM: Don't strain a hammy.

02:18:14.695 --> 02:18:16.419
LAURA: Goddamn it! Really?

02:18:16.419 --> 02:18:17.463
MATT: Is that a one?

02:18:17.463 --> 02:18:18.570
LAURA: One and a two.

02:18:18.570 --> 02:18:19.853
MATT and SAM: Aw.

02:18:19.853 --> 02:18:26.839
LAURA: I could've cast it at 1st-level! Damn it!
You still only got fucking seven points of fucking healing!

02:18:28.622 --> 02:18:31.005
SAM: I feel guilty for having needs!

02:18:32.815 --> 02:18:35.406
TALIESIN: I was going to say, Yasha, maybe?

02:18:35.691 --> 02:18:38.529
SAM: Oh wait, I could've just--
we could have rested and I could've used hit dice.

02:18:38.529 --> 02:18:40.174
LAURA: Goddamn it!

02:18:40.174 --> 02:18:42.000
TRAVIS: We should rest right now.

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:45.403
ASHLEY: Can I dig through one of the ashes? The
urn?

02:18:45.403 --> 02:18:47.418
LAURA: I just wasted one of my 2nd-levels y'all!

02:18:47.418 --> 02:18:48.508
MARISHA: Okay, we can keep going.

02:18:48.508 --> 02:18:49.843
TRAVIS: We're still resting.

02:18:50.833 --> 02:18:52.410
ASHLEY: Still garbage?

02:18:52.458 --> 02:18:56.348
MATT: You and Molly are doing this, if I recall,
before we entered the break. The base of each urn,

02:18:56.348 --> 02:19:03.990
the lower half of it, is actually a metal-lined
bottom. Looking on the inside, as you scoop out

02:19:03.990 --> 02:19:10.087
the ash, (blowing) get it to empty the space, you
can see, very faintly on the inside of the metal,

02:19:10.087 --> 02:19:17.255
very faint carvings matching the symbols you have
seen in the previous room.

02:19:17.255 --> 02:19:18.296
SAM: Oh, shit!

02:19:18.296 --> 02:19:23.526
LAURA: Which room? Let's take the piece of metal
down! Wait, does each of the urns have a different one?

02:19:23.881 --> 02:19:26.158
MATT: Each of the urns has all eight symbols in
it.

02:19:26.158 --> 02:19:27.253
LAURA: Oh.

02:19:27.253 --> 02:19:32.770
LIAM: At this point, we should be able to see the
things that the very perceptive people saw, which

02:19:32.770 --> 02:19:35.635
was two faces, eyes with holes in them in the
middle--

02:19:35.635 --> 02:19:36.447
MATT: Yes.

02:19:36.447 --> 02:19:37.476
LIAM: In this room?

02:19:37.476 --> 02:19:38.293
LAURA: Yeah.

02:19:38.293 --> 02:19:39.582
LIAM: Should we do it in this room?

02:19:39.582 --> 02:19:41.399
TRAVIS: Are the eye holes about the size of gold
coins?

02:19:41.399 --> 02:19:43.239
MATT: Roughly.

02:19:43.239 --> 02:19:46.669
TRAVIS: I'll take two gold coins and put them in
both of the eyes on one of the faces.

02:19:46.669 --> 02:19:51.913
MATT: On the faces? Okay. You take two gold coins
out, and you place them roughly, and they both fit

02:19:51.913 --> 02:19:54.440
into the eyes of one face.

02:19:54.440 --> 02:19:56.481
TRAVIS: I'll do that to the other two eyes in the
other face.

02:19:56.481 --> 02:20:03.901
MATT: Okay. As you place them, as soon as they
occur in there, the relief opens in half and you

02:20:04.028 --> 02:20:07.432
fall. Make a dexterity saving throw.

02:20:07.432 --> 02:20:09.827
ASHLEY: Whoopsies.

02:20:10.092 --> 02:20:11.774
TRAVIS: Was not anticipating that.

02:20:11.774 --> 02:20:13.535
MARISHA: For the boatman.

02:20:13.535 --> 02:20:16.216
TRAVIS: He always gets his due.

02:20:16.216 --> 02:20:20.832
LIAM: Mama, put the coins in my eyes because I
sure do not believe what I am seeing.

02:20:21.756 --> 02:20:23.092
TRAVIS: That's an eight.

02:20:23.092 --> 02:20:24.443
MATT: That's an eight!

02:20:24.443 --> 02:20:27.912
SAM: As he falls, I throw a piece of feather and I
cast Feather Fall on him.

02:20:30.012 --> 02:20:32.041
MARISHA: Holy shit, that's awesome!

02:20:32.142 --> 02:20:34.436
MATT: That's a reaction. What's the range on
that?

02:20:34.436 --> 02:20:36.042
SAM: 60 feet.

02:20:36.042 --> 02:20:42.444
MATT: Yeah, you're fine. Fjord suddenly begins to
disappear, the floor going out underneath. This

02:20:42.444 --> 02:20:46.996
looks of fear comes over his eyes as Nott barely
releases the spell in time, and Fjord goes from

02:20:46.996 --> 02:20:54.411
plummeting to gently falling. You glide down, and
you look down below you into the darkness. You

02:20:54.411 --> 02:21:00.712
descend ten, 15, 20--

02:21:00.712 --> 02:21:03.877
MARISHA: Beau hollers out: Hey, I think you
figured out that puzzle!

02:21:03.877 --> 02:21:05.791
TALIESIN: We should probably put a light in
there.

02:21:05.791 --> 02:21:12.841
LIAM: Caleb doesn't say anything or move at all,
but he's thoroughly impressed with Nott, by the way.

02:21:12.920 --> 02:21:15.052
TRAVIS: Yep. Me too.

02:21:15.052 --> 02:21:20.219
MATT: About 30 feet down, you see something
rapidly coming up below you. Looks like a floor or

02:21:20.219 --> 02:21:27.090
a surface, though it is somewhat amorphous and
jumbled that it looks hard to see any sort of

02:21:27.090 --> 02:21:28.344
shape to it.

02:21:28.344 --> 02:21:30.274
TRAVIS: Are things moving?

02:21:30.274 --> 02:21:33.415
LIAM: I will send two of my globules down after
him.

02:21:33.415 --> 02:21:37.653
MATT: Okay. With your low light vision, looking
down below, eventually your feet land. It's soft

02:21:37.653 --> 02:21:44.478
and crunchy as your feet land. You glance down and
the smell gets you immediately. It's a heavy smell

02:21:44.478 --> 02:21:59.558
of decay, of dust, and ash. You look down below
and your are sunken into a pile of long-rotting

02:21:59.558 --> 02:22:06.185
clothing. Occasionally, your foot hits something
that cracks, and you can see some charred bones

02:22:06.185 --> 02:22:07.603
that remain within.

02:22:07.603 --> 02:22:08.431
LAURA: Charred?

02:22:08.431 --> 02:22:09.239
MATT: Yes.

02:22:09.239 --> 02:22:10.618
TALIESIN: This is how they clean the room.

02:22:10.618 --> 02:22:12.941
LIAM: How far down is that? Does everybody see?

02:22:12.941 --> 02:22:15.173
MATT: It's about 30-35 feet down.

02:22:15.173 --> 02:22:18.666
ASHLEY: I'm going to take a rope out of my bag and
wrap it around a pillar.

02:22:18.666 --> 02:22:21.499
MATT: Okay. You take it and tie it off to the
side.

02:22:21.499 --> 02:22:23.806
LAURA: Fjord, do you see anything cool down
there?

02:22:23.806 --> 02:22:28.923
TRAVIS: Yeah. There's a bunch of old clothes. It
smells awful down here.

02:22:28.923 --> 02:22:31.238
LAURA: Does anybody have weapons or coins on
them?

02:22:31.238 --> 02:22:35.264
TRAVIS: I haven't really looked. I still got this
damn bronze rod with me, too, so I got to find my

02:22:35.264 --> 02:22:37.013
way out of here.

02:22:37.013 --> 02:22:39.384
LAURA: We'll get you out. Just look for something
cool, though.

02:22:39.384 --> 02:22:40.690
ASHLEY: Can I throw the torch down there?

02:22:40.690 --> 02:22:42.021
MATT: Yeah. As you--

02:22:42.021 --> 02:22:44.152
ASHLEY: Fjord.

02:22:44.152 --> 02:22:46.664
MATT: You hear your name and you look up just as
the torch--

02:22:46.664 --> 02:22:48.675
TRAVIS: Okay!

02:22:48.675 --> 02:22:56.368
MATT: You reach up and try and grab it. Catch it,
(fumbling).

02:22:57.498 --> 02:22:59.368
MARISHA: Let it fall!

02:22:59.538 --> 02:23:02.489
TRAVIS: Falls in the clothes, I start burning
alive.

02:23:04.641 --> 02:23:06.521
SAM: A rope?

02:23:06.521 --> 02:23:07.746
LIAM: Yeah.

02:23:07.746 --> 02:23:09.123
TALIESIN: We already have a rope down.

02:23:09.123 --> 02:23:10.169
ASHLEY: I put a rope down.

02:23:10.169 --> 02:23:12.672
TRAVIS: Can I look around, see if there are any
weapons or objects?

02:23:12.672 --> 02:23:15.160
MATT: Make an investigation check.

02:23:15.160 --> 02:23:18.023
LIAM: Caleb is travelling down the rope that Yasha
dropped.

02:23:18.023 --> 02:23:20.631
TRAVIS: Oh. That's great. Natural 19. That's a
21.

02:23:20.631 --> 02:23:30.593
MATT: 21?! You guys hear the sound of shifting and
clattering of material and bone-like objects

02:23:30.593 --> 02:23:35.131
against each other and the stone side of the
chamber. You, Fjord, begin to pour through. You're

02:23:35.131 --> 02:23:41.628
tugging through the clothing that's here has been
slowly rotting over time, the material coming

02:23:41.628 --> 02:23:46.000
apart. As you pull it apart, you see the tunics
and the pantaloons, and all the different pieces

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:51.618
of clothing that are in here pull apart almost as
your fingers go into it. There's no remaining

02:23:51.618 --> 02:24:00.604
flesh. The decay smell is not fresh decay. It's
old, stagnant, long past sealed decay. As you pull

02:24:00.604 --> 02:24:07.467
through, you do find some pieces of silver and
gold jewelry. They're tucked in pockets of some of

02:24:07.467 --> 02:24:13.288
this clothing. You can see one skeletal wrist that
has this really nice-looking bracelet with a chain

02:24:13.288 --> 02:24:19.422
that goes around the center finger but the bone is
snapped off, and the bone itself is still charred

02:24:19.422 --> 02:24:23.442
black around most sides. Only a little bit of
grayish white peeks through in places as you rub

02:24:23.442 --> 02:24:28.385
your finger over it. There are some pieces of
jewelry here that's probably worth a little bit of

02:24:28.385 --> 02:24:33.638
money. Because you rolled that high, you also pull
through, in one of the pockets, you can see a

02:24:33.638 --> 02:24:40.474
small leather case about that wide, with the lid
that's burnt. As you pull it, it tears off

02:24:40.584 --> 02:24:47.560
entirely. Looking inside, there's a very thin,
diamond shaped vial. You pull it out and shake it.

02:24:47.560 --> 02:24:52.027
It has a stopper on it that looks either a rubber
or a coated cork that is buttoned on one side that

02:24:52.027 --> 02:24:58.602
is built into the actual crystal container's cap.
You watch it, swish around, holding the torch up

02:24:58.602 --> 02:25:06.085
to it, it has a brackish dark brown/black tint to
it like thick sludge pond water.

02:25:06.085 --> 02:25:10.394
LIAM: I would've gotten down the rope at this
point, and seeing Fjord examine that, I cast

02:25:10.394 --> 02:25:11.799
Detect Magic instantly.

02:25:11.799 --> 02:25:13.017
MATT: Okay. It is definitely magical.

02:25:13.017 --> 02:25:14.761
LIAM: Okay. What kind?

02:25:14.761 --> 02:25:16.988
ASHLEY and LAURA: What kind?

02:25:16.988 --> 02:25:18.795
LIAM: I'm allowed to know. It's in the book.

02:25:19.995 --> 02:25:21.592
LAURA: You can ask nicely.

02:25:23.386 --> 02:25:26.206
MATT: I would say abjuration.

02:25:26.206 --> 02:25:29.667
LIAM: What's in the fucking potion, Matt?

02:25:29.667 --> 02:25:31.290
MATT: You have to identify it to find out.

02:25:31.290 --> 02:25:40.312
TRAVIS: Okay. I'll take some of the nice jewelry
and stuff like that and the little vial. Are there

02:25:40.312 --> 02:25:43.978
any other doors or entrances or shoots?

02:25:43.978 --> 02:25:48.624
MATT: No. It ends here. There is a pit and you
finally reached the bottom after pulling through.

02:25:48.624 --> 02:25:53.580
You've probably gone through about 40 or so
equivalent outfits.

02:25:53.580 --> 02:25:58.330
LIAM: Does Detect Magic uncover anything else
besides what he's already looking through?

02:25:58.330 --> 02:26:01.284
MATT: No. Just the vial that he discovered.

02:26:01.284 --> 02:26:03.235
LAURA: Everybody else was resting up top while--

02:26:03.235 --> 02:26:04.760
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, short rest.

02:26:04.760 --> 02:26:05.848
MAISHA: Ooh, can we do that?

02:26:05.848 --> 02:26:08.681
MATT: If you guys want to take a short rest, about
an hour or so to take a moment and take a

02:26:08.681 --> 02:26:10.672
breather. Use your hit dice.

02:26:10.672 --> 02:26:11.823
LIAM: Oh, an hour.

02:26:11.823 --> 02:26:14.466
LAURA: It's okay because I don't get my spells
back with rests, so that's really good that I used

02:26:14.466 --> 02:26:16.296
it and everything.

02:26:16.296 --> 02:26:18.194
SAM: I appreciate it.

02:26:18.966 --> 02:26:25.362
LIAM: Fjord, hold that up for me so I can tell you
what it is. I will spend the next 10 minutes, with

02:26:25.362 --> 02:26:28.218
Fjord sitting in front of me and me looking at it
and doing the ritual.

02:26:28.218 --> 02:26:31.804
MATT: Well, you guys haven't taken a short rest
yet. They're taking a short rest. You can go

02:26:31.804 --> 02:26:33.372
upstairs if you want to.

02:26:33.372 --> 02:26:35.777
LIAM: You want to rest first or do you want me to
tell you what it is now?

02:26:35.777 --> 02:26:37.497
TRAVIS: You can tell me what it is now.

02:26:37.497 --> 02:26:40.784
LIAM: Okay, so 10 minutes that takes. Identify.

02:26:40.784 --> 02:26:48.335
MATT: All right, that is a potion of necrotic
resistance.

02:26:48.335 --> 02:26:51.320
LIAM: Well, I don't have it. You have it.

02:26:51.320 --> 02:26:57.093
TRAVIS: "When you drink this potion, you gain
resistance to necrotic damage for one hour." Nice.

02:26:57.093 --> 02:26:58.762
Cool.

02:27:01.112 --> 02:27:08.692
MARISHA: Whenever we get done with the short rest,
can Beau start peeking through and digging away at

02:27:08.835 --> 02:27:11.703
the collapsed entrance into that tunnel?

02:27:11.703 --> 02:27:13.448
MATT: Okay. Make an athletics check.

02:27:13.448 --> 02:27:15.620
SAM: I sewed my thumb back on.

02:27:18.090 --> 02:27:23.269
MATT: Okay. Ten minutes pass. You guys climb back
up out of the pit?

02:27:23.412 --> 02:27:24.310
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:27:24.310 --> 02:27:27.136
MATT: Okay. You guys head up and join. The rest of
them are going to be resting for the next 45 or so

02:27:27.136 --> 02:27:29.918
minutes. You can join them if you want them to
wait for you as well.

02:27:29.918 --> 02:27:31.256
TRAVIS: I'd like to, yeah.

02:27:31.256 --> 02:27:33.663
MATT: Okay. You guys complete a short rest as
well. Go for it.

02:27:33.663 --> 02:27:35.260
LIAM: Arcane recovery.

02:27:35.260 --> 02:27:38.115
MATT: While you guys are finishing that up, Beau
is rummaging through the rubble.

02:27:38.115 --> 02:27:41.128
MARISHA: It wasn't good. Six. Slow going.

02:27:41.128 --> 02:27:46.157
MATT: You spend about 30 minutes or so, and you
maybe get about two feet into the rubble, and

02:27:46.157 --> 02:27:49.980
you're not sure how far back it goes. A lot of the
stones now you're getting to are now too big for

02:27:49.980 --> 02:27:51.264
you to move.

02:27:51.264 --> 02:27:55.033
MARISHA: Was there a little crawl space at the top
that we could crawl through?

02:27:55.033 --> 02:27:57.952
MATT: No. The ceiling caved in on that side.

02:27:59.572 --> 02:28:04.022
MARISHA: Well. It's just me and I rolled shitty.

02:28:06.923 --> 02:28:09.696
MATT: All right. You guys have all taken your time
to short rest--

02:28:09.696 --> 02:28:14.610
SAM: We've also discovered that Ashley has more
dice than Laura, apparently.

02:28:14.610 --> 02:28:16.111
ASHLEY: No, I don't!

02:28:16.111 --> 02:28:19.421
SAM: What is this? What is this gigantic box of
dice?

02:28:19.421 --> 02:28:21.389
ASHLEY: Listen, she has a whole duffel bag.

02:28:21.389 --> 02:28:24.886
SAM: Yeah, but she doesn't <i>use</i> those. These are
all active for tonight!

02:28:24.886 --> 02:28:28.708
ASHLEY: Listen! I like to have all my options.

02:28:28.708 --> 02:28:29.355
MATT: Exactly.

02:28:29.355 --> 02:28:30.557
LAURA: Yeah!

02:28:30.557 --> 02:28:32.152
SAM: This is terrible.

02:28:32.152 --> 02:28:34.356
ASHLEY: It's not all my fault.

02:28:34.356 --> 02:28:37.984
TALIESIN: I believe in you. This is fine.

02:28:37.984 --> 02:28:40.020
ASHLEY: Thank you.

02:28:40.020 --> 02:28:43.086
LAURA: She needs better organization.

02:28:43.086 --> 02:28:44.694
ASHLEY: I need better organization.

02:28:44.694 --> 02:28:47.148
LAURA: You got to divide them out.

02:28:48.738 --> 02:28:53.909
TRAVIS: Shall we make our way back downstairs to
see what this rod does in the little hole?

02:28:54.263 --> 02:28:56.764
SAM: I thought we were supposed to turn the
ceiling from up here, no?

02:28:56.764 --> 02:29:00.454
TALIESIN: How big are the bevels, that have
the relief of the 12--?

02:29:00.454 --> 02:29:03.287
MATT: They're about that big in the bottom,
and about a heavy bowl size.

02:29:03.287 --> 02:29:06.607
LAURA: I think the corkscrew's going to stick in
the hole and move the whole room or something.

02:29:06.607 --> 02:29:10.607
LIAM: Yeah, the eyes were for uncovering all that
death underneath our feet.

02:29:11.449 --> 02:29:16.631
MARISHA: The ceiling is through here and it's
blocked by a bunch of rubble. We can try and dig

02:29:16.631 --> 02:29:18.526
through it if we think something should be up
there.

02:29:18.526 --> 02:29:19.782
SAM: No, we should use the stairs.

02:29:19.782 --> 02:29:21.403
MARISHA: All right.

02:29:21.915 --> 02:29:23.091
MATT: So what are you guys doing?

02:29:23.091 --> 02:29:24.855
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're going to go back downstairs.

02:29:24.855 --> 02:29:27.256
LAURA: We can try to move some of the rubble?

02:29:27.256 --> 02:29:31.729
MARISHA: I've been, like small boulders. I've been
(struggling).

02:29:31.729 --> 02:29:33.792
MATT: So you're taking the rod, and you guys are
heading downstairs?

02:29:33.792 --> 02:29:34.728
TALIESIN: And the bowls.

02:29:34.728 --> 02:29:38.751
MATT: Using the bowls as well. Okay. You have the
three urn vases.

02:29:38.751 --> 02:29:41.307
TALIESIN: Mm--hmm. Clean them off a bit.

02:29:41.307 --> 02:29:47.339
LIAM: Fjord, you can, of course, stick that thing
in the hole in that bottom room if you want, but

02:29:47.339 --> 02:29:54.728
if you like, my man Schmidt could do it, with
little risk to the rest of us. If you like.

02:29:54.728 --> 02:29:57.836
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah. Give him a shot.

02:29:57.836 --> 02:30:01.268
LIAM: We should all stand back. Better safe than
sorry.

02:30:01.268 --> 02:30:03.647
LAURA: Do we know which way we're turning
everything now?

02:30:03.647 --> 02:30:05.243
TRAVIS, TALIESIN, and LIAM: Yeah.

02:30:05.243 --> 02:30:06.929
LAURA: Oh, everybody knows it already.

02:30:06.929 --> 02:30:09.528
SAM: I don't know. It seems like they know, they
decided without us.

02:30:09.528 --> 02:30:12.456
LAURA: But why did you decide the way that you're
saying it?

02:30:12.456 --> 02:30:18.406
LIAM: Well look here, now that we're back peering
through the doorway at this. We have this star on

02:30:18.406 --> 02:30:23.318
that corner, and if you would rotate-- we don't
know what we're rotating is the thing.

02:30:23.318 --> 02:30:25.398
TRAVIS: We're hoping that we'll get it to turn.

02:30:25.398 --> 02:30:29.970
MARISHA: If the thing goes two clicks-- correct,
it goes there.

02:30:29.970 --> 02:30:34.599
LIAM: We're saying that's the idea because there's
a diamond to a diamond, and a star to a star, and

02:30:34.599 --> 02:30:37.082
a triangle of dots to that triangle.

02:30:37.082 --> 02:30:39.368
LAURA: Yeah I like the way you guys think, that
sounds smart.

02:30:39.368 --> 02:30:41.067
SAM: So smart.

02:30:41.067 --> 02:30:43.840
LIAM: Well I bumped up to 20.

02:30:43.840 --> 02:30:50.588
LAURA: So that's evocation you guys, and
divination, and necromancy.

02:30:50.588 --> 02:30:52.966
LIAM: Edubation. It's critical.

02:30:52.966 --> 02:30:56.417
MARISHA: So wait, divination, evocation,
necromancy.

02:30:56.417 --> 02:31:01.156
SAM: That's dead things, good things, and
in-between things?

02:31:01.156 --> 02:31:03.807
MARISHA: And elemental things, right? Isn't
evocation--

02:31:03.807 --> 02:31:05.766
LIAM: Evocation is destruction.

02:31:05.766 --> 02:31:08.839
MARISHA: Fire, lightning, elemental things.

02:31:08.839 --> 02:31:14.799
MATT: You guys descend the staircase, find your
way to the base floor. You head to the hallway

02:31:14.799 --> 02:31:19.306
where you had previously disabled the traps and
carefully step across each threshold without

02:31:19.306 --> 02:31:21.212
issue, they still remain disabled.

02:31:21.212 --> 02:31:22.534
SAM: I did that.

02:31:22.949 --> 02:31:27.806
MATT: You make your way into the central octagonal
chamber. What would you like to do?

02:31:27.806 --> 02:31:32.509
LIAM: I'm casting, in an instant, Unseen Servant.
Schmidt is here with us.

02:31:32.509 --> 02:31:34.551
MATT: Schmidt appears, unseen.

02:31:34.551 --> 02:31:44.005
LIAM: Fjord, hold out your magic whatsit there. I
command Fjord to give that to Schmidt, Schmidt

02:31:44.005 --> 02:31:45.307
takes it.

02:31:45.307 --> 02:31:47.613
TRAVIS: I refuse your command and I give it to
Schmidt willingly.

02:31:47.613 --> 02:31:49.017
LIAM: The spell runs out--

02:31:49.017 --> 02:31:51.878
(laughter)

02:31:52.782 --> 02:32:00.322
LIAM: I ask Schmidt to insert the spirally staff
into the Laura Bailey hole in the center of the dais.

02:32:02.356 --> 02:32:11.563
MATT: You watch as the rod gingerly drifts over to
the center place, slips in, locks into place.

02:32:11.563 --> 02:32:15.404
MARISHA: Something bad might happen once we turn
this, so be on guard.

02:32:15.404 --> 02:32:18.649
LIAM: It is true, that's why we're hanging back
behind the door. Do we think we should go

02:32:18.649 --> 02:32:20.540
clockwise or counter-clockwise?

02:32:20.540 --> 02:32:22.997
TRAVIS: Counter-clockwise.

02:32:24.013 --> 02:32:29.384
LIAM: Schmidt, please revolve that staff
counter-clockwise please.

02:32:31.816 --> 02:32:33.071
MATT: Nothing moves.

02:32:33.071 --> 02:32:35.367
LIAM: Well, try it clockwise then, Schmidt.

02:32:35.367 --> 02:32:36.435
MATT: Nothing moves.

02:32:36.435 --> 02:32:37.882
LIAM: Well, that's a lot of bollocks then.

02:32:37.882 --> 02:32:43.400
LAURA: Maybe it's got to be a real person. Maybe
you have to cast a spell that has to do with the

02:32:43.400 --> 02:32:45.201
class of magic!

02:32:45.201 --> 02:32:48.542
TALIESIN: I've got an idea. I'm going to start
rocking upstairs.

02:32:48.542 --> 02:32:49.868
TRAVIS: Rocking upstairs?

02:32:49.868 --> 02:32:51.465
TALIESIN: I'm walking upstairs.

02:32:51.465 --> 02:32:56.505
MARISHA: I'm going to join Molly, I think someone
needs to be upstairs. You guys stay.

02:32:56.505 --> 02:32:58.000
MATT: Molly, you have the bowls right?

02:32:58.000 --> 02:32:59.882
TALIESIN: I have the bowls.

02:32:59.882 --> 02:33:02.295
MATT: Beau and Molly head back up the stairs.

02:33:02.295 --> 02:33:05.467
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a look at that
purple-- is there only one of those little purple

02:33:05.467 --> 02:33:08.149
glowing rocks that seems to be creating light?

02:33:08.149 --> 02:33:13.248
MATT: As you look going through, you see there are
a few other stone cages that have been opened and

02:33:13.248 --> 02:33:15.507
left empty. That is one that has not been
removed.

02:33:15.507 --> 02:33:18.974
TALIESIN: I'm going to open it and I will-- I'm
going to poke at it to see if it seems trapped or anything.

02:33:19.261 --> 02:33:21.247
MATT: Okay, make an investigation check.

02:33:21.348 --> 02:33:22.526
TALIESIN: All right.

02:33:25.120 --> 02:33:26.443
16.

02:33:26.443 --> 02:33:28.674
MATT: Does not appear to be trapped.

02:33:28.674 --> 02:33:31.676
TALIESIN: I'm going to open it and grab the stone
out.

02:33:31.676 --> 02:33:35.073
MATT: Make a strength check to try and wedge it
from the stone it's attached to.

02:33:35.591 --> 02:33:37.449
TALIESIN: That's a six.

02:33:37.449 --> 02:33:42.988
MATT: (grunting) It's not budging. Your lithe
tiefling form is not quite sturdy enough to pull

02:33:42.988 --> 02:33:45.067
it from the stone.

02:33:45.067 --> 02:33:46.679
LIAM: Dance it out of there.

02:33:46.679 --> 02:33:47.727
TALIESIN: Beau!

02:33:47.727 --> 02:33:48.838
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:33:48.838 --> 02:33:51.137
TALIESIN: Can you punch this?

02:33:51.137 --> 02:33:56.714
MARISHA: I got you one better. I'll shove in my
staff and push against the pillar and use it as

02:33:56.714 --> 02:33:59.214
leverage, see if I can pry it open.

02:33:59.214 --> 02:34:05.677
MATT: Okay. Yeah, I'll give you that. Make a
dexterity check. Finding the proper point of

02:34:05.677 --> 02:34:07.406
leverage to push on.

02:34:07.406 --> 02:34:10.860
MARISHA: Ooh, natural 18. 22.

02:34:10.860 --> 02:34:16.100
MATT: The metal actually unhinges and the stone
plummets out, you catch it.

02:34:16.228 --> 02:34:22.980
MARISHA: You see this is like a simple-- sorry,
it's like a simple tool. Sorry, I drooled a little.

02:34:22.980 --> 02:34:24.687
TALIESIN: Is that your new nickname?

02:34:24.687 --> 02:34:25.461
MARISHA: What?

02:34:25.461 --> 02:34:26.703
TALIESIN: Simple tool.

02:34:26.703 --> 02:34:29.936
MARISHA: You know what? That's fair, I'll take
that. That was a good one.

02:34:29.936 --> 02:34:31.600
TALIESIN: Well, you did do this. I won't tell
anyone, come on.

02:34:31.600 --> 02:34:33.207
MARISHA: It was a good jab.

02:34:33.207 --> 02:34:44.038
TALIESIN: We walk back down with it. Beau
retrieved this, maybe? We've got a glowing rock.

02:34:44.038 --> 02:34:47.663
I'm going to put it in the room, see if anything
happens.

02:34:47.663 --> 02:34:49.337
MATT: No reaction.

02:34:49.337 --> 02:34:54.235
TALIESIN: We've got these bowls, I'm going to put
the bowls, gingerly, I'm going to put one of the

02:34:54.235 --> 02:34:57.574
bowls on one of the symbols to see what happens.

02:34:57.574 --> 02:35:00.224
MATT: Okay, which symbol?

02:35:00.224 --> 02:35:03.614
TALIESIN: Put it-- middle of the star.

02:35:03.614 --> 02:35:08.578
MATT: Okay. Place it in the middle of the star.
The metal bowl sits there, the fine engravings of

02:35:08.578 --> 02:35:11.217
all the symbols on the inside of each bowl don't
seem to react.

02:35:11.217 --> 02:35:14.161
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and move the bowl to
match the engravings in the ceiling.

02:35:14.161 --> 02:35:21.605
MATT: Okay, you have three bowls, and each bowl
contains all eight symbols in the inside, so it's

02:35:21.605 --> 02:35:24.352
hard to match them per se.

02:35:24.352 --> 02:35:26.370
LAURA: Cast a spell on one of the bowls!

02:35:26.370 --> 02:35:30.705
SAM: Why don't we try a person to use the rod
first before we start wasting spells?

02:35:30.705 --> 02:35:33.132
TRAVIS: Yeah okay, I'll walk up and I'll grab the
rod.

02:35:33.132 --> 02:35:35.223
SAM: You're weak, shouldn't we use a strong
person?

02:35:35.223 --> 02:35:37.958
MATT: The rod doesn't shift.

02:35:37.958 --> 02:35:39.298
TRAVIS: It doesn't move.

02:35:39.298 --> 02:35:44.537
MATT: You move it the other way and it comes out,
you have to put it back in and lock it into place,

02:35:44.537 --> 02:35:46.514
but it doesn't seem to shift or move.

02:35:46.514 --> 02:35:48.503
TALIESIN: What's the the top of the rod again? The
top of that little spiral.

02:35:48.503 --> 02:35:52.695
MATT: It's a small little metallic knob at the
end.

02:35:52.695 --> 02:35:57.380
TALIESIN: I'm going to examine it, anything
interesting about it? Just a small metallic knob?

02:35:57.380 --> 02:36:01.047
MATT: Best you can look at it, it doesn't have any
markings on it or anything unique, it's just a

02:36:01.047 --> 02:36:03.629
solid round knob end.

02:36:03.629 --> 02:36:04.857
TALIESIN: Like a lightning rod?

02:36:04.857 --> 02:36:06.125
MATT: Something like that.

02:36:06.125 --> 02:36:11.059
SAM: Yasha, you're strong. Why don't you go try
and twist the thing?

02:36:11.059 --> 02:36:13.100
ASHLEY: All right, I'll give it a try.

02:36:14.398 --> 02:36:19.492
MATT: You spend a good two minutes shifting on the
rod the opposite direction where it locks. No movement.

02:36:19.613 --> 02:36:23.556
TRAVIS: Do we think we need to cast unique spells
into those bowls for each of the three schools of

02:36:23.556 --> 02:36:26.755
magic? Which is what Jester said.

02:36:26.755 --> 02:36:29.258
MARISHA: We heard you.

02:36:29.258 --> 02:36:30.916
LAURA: (angrily) No, it's fine!

02:36:30.978 --> 02:36:35.343
TRAVIS: I'm trying to figure out, how do you cast
necrotic damage on a bowl?

02:36:35.343 --> 02:36:40.114
LAURA: I don't know, I could Inflict Wounds on it
or something, or Toll the Dead on the bowl.

02:36:40.114 --> 02:36:42.689
TRAVIS: You want to Inflict Wounds on one of
them?

02:36:42.689 --> 02:36:48.698
LAURA: Well no, I'm going to use a cantrip because
it's better. So I'm going to Toll the Dead on--

02:36:49.007 --> 02:36:51.181
SAM: What is it? Evocation?

02:36:51.181 --> 02:36:59.824
LAURA: Necrotic, divination, and evocation. So
I'll try to Toll the Dead on one of the bowls, the

02:36:59.824 --> 02:37:07.466
one that is sitting on the diamond.

02:37:07.466 --> 02:37:14.534
MATT: You cast Toll the Dead. The dark arcane
energy from Toll the Dead begins to gather around

02:37:14.534 --> 02:37:21.114
the hand of Jester, and as you release the spell
you watch this burst of necrotic energy siphon

02:37:21.114 --> 02:37:25.669
back and immediately attach itself to the very top
of this metallic rod.

02:37:25.669 --> 02:37:28.323
(cheering)

02:37:28.323 --> 02:37:34.424
MATT: It's absorbed and there's a moment of pause
before you feel (banging sound).

02:37:34.424 --> 02:37:36.047
TALIESIN: Let's do the other two.

02:37:36.047 --> 02:37:38.045
LAURA: Wait, is it turning?

02:37:38.045 --> 02:37:53.279
MATT: You hear a shifting of stone-- this faint
slithering sound begins to fill the chamber.

02:37:53.279 --> 02:37:56.600
TRAVIS: Other two! Or maybe not.

02:37:56.600 --> 02:38:06.968
MATT: The slithering stops. (booming) You watch as
your eyes catch something shift above you. That

02:38:06.968 --> 02:38:14.236
large square pillar that was locked in the
ceiling, that dome underneath it opened up and a

02:38:14.236 --> 02:38:20.986
strange, translucent, cube-like creature comes
descending from the center. I need you guys all to

02:38:20.986 --> 02:38:22.297
roll initiative.

02:38:22.307 --> 02:38:23.437
(yelling)

02:38:23.441 --> 02:38:25.297
LIAM: Not a gelatinous cube!

02:38:25.380 --> 02:38:27.994
TRAVIS: Did we pick the form of our killer?

02:38:27.994 --> 02:38:31.129
LIAM: A gelatinous cube!

02:38:31.129 --> 02:38:33.533
MARISHA: Wait, but you did necromantic, right?

02:38:33.533 --> 02:38:34.735
LAURA: Yeah.

02:38:34.735 --> 02:38:37.260
LIAM: Oh shit!

02:38:37.260 --> 02:38:40.802
SAM: Wait, if we had picked a different magic
would a different monster--

02:38:40.802 --> 02:38:42.487
TRAVIS: I think so.

02:38:42.487 --> 02:38:44.765
MARISHA: Maybe it's a trial, maybe we have to
fight all of them!

02:38:44.765 --> 02:38:47.437
LIAM: We might need to do all three at the same
time?

02:38:47.437 --> 02:38:49.587
MATT: (impact)

02:38:49.587 --> 02:38:51.708
(screaming)

02:38:51.708 --> 02:38:53.655
LIAM: Guys, fucking focus!

02:38:53.655 --> 02:38:54.295
Focus!

02:38:54.295 --> 02:38:56.801
MARISHA: I'm going to use my boots at this point.

02:38:56.855 --> 02:38:59.367
LAURA: See, this is why I shouldn't have used my
spell!

02:38:59.367 --> 02:39:01.877
LIAM: No more dick jokes! Focus on the cube.

02:39:01.877 --> 02:39:03.720
LAURA: That wasn't a dick joke!

02:39:03.720 --> 02:39:05.999
SAM: Everything's a dick joke with you, Laura.

02:39:06.379 --> 02:39:13.389
MATT: All right, guys. So let me pull out the
gelatinous cube stat block here.

02:39:13.389 --> 02:39:16.844
LIAM: This is <i>dangerous</i>!

02:39:16.844 --> 02:39:22.238
MATT: That is a super low initiative. That is a
zero initiative for the gelatinous cube. Four

02:39:22.238 --> 02:39:26.616
minus four. Initiative, 25 to 20.

02:39:26.616 --> 02:39:27.853
LAURA: 20.

02:39:27.853 --> 02:39:28.804
LIAM: 21!

02:39:28.804 --> 02:39:35.159
MATT: Nice! Caleb coming around, finally. Then
Jester. 20 to 15.

02:39:35.159 --> 02:39:37.410
TALIESIN: Crickets.

02:39:37.410 --> 02:39:38.824
MARISHA: 20 to 15?

02:39:38.824 --> 02:39:40.243
MATT: Yes.

02:39:40.243 --> 02:39:41.900
MARISHA: Negative, no.

02:39:41.900 --> 02:39:43.130
MATT: 15 to ten?

02:39:43.130 --> 02:39:45.543
MARISHA and ASHLEY: 12.

02:39:45.543 --> 02:39:49.090
MARISHA: Sentinel bitches!

02:39:49.090 --> 02:39:52.806
MATT: Beau and Yasha. Ten to five?

02:39:52.806 --> 02:39:54.564
TRAVIS: Seven.

02:39:54.564 --> 02:39:55.767
TALIESIN: Eight.

02:39:55.767 --> 02:39:56.977
SAM: Seven.

02:39:57.004 --> 02:39:59.497
LAURA: I don't know, how do you fight a gelatinous
cube?

02:39:59.497 --> 02:40:00.982
LIAM: You die.

02:40:00.982 --> 02:40:02.345
ASHLEY: I don't want to!

02:40:02.345 --> 02:40:03.595
MARISHA: They suck you up.

02:40:03.595 --> 02:40:04.548
LAURA: I know!

02:40:04.548 --> 02:40:05.618
MARISHA: It's bad.

02:40:05.618 --> 02:40:06.971
LAURA: But I don't know how to defeat them!

02:40:06.971 --> 02:40:09.258
MARISHA: I don't know!

02:40:10.566 --> 02:40:17.374
MATT: As it slid into the ground, it completely
consumed the rod and immediately begins to move

02:40:17.374 --> 02:40:23.644
its way forward ever so slowly in your direction
of the cluster group. That being the case, top of

02:40:23.768 --> 02:40:30.445
the round we have Caleb, you're first. By the way,
where do you want your kitty?

02:40:30.445 --> 02:40:31.589
LIAM: Frumpkin, or--?

02:40:31.589 --> 02:40:32.795
MATT: Frumpkin.

02:40:32.795 --> 02:40:36.442
LIAM: Frumpkin can be, oh jeez, right behind me is
fine.

02:40:36.442 --> 02:40:38.686
MATT: There you go. What are you doing?

02:40:38.686 --> 02:40:43.545
LIAM: I'm going to use all my movement to move
back towards the doorway as best I can.

02:40:43.545 --> 02:40:44.833
MATT: Over here?

02:40:44.833 --> 02:40:54.409
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>. As I am doing so, I am pulling a small
clay cat paw out of my hand. I mutter a few arcane

02:40:54.409 --> 02:41:09.097
words and I cast Maximilian's Earthen Grasp. A wad
of soil forms out the ground and a cat's paw rises

02:41:09.097 --> 02:41:13.448
up and reaches out and swats at the gelatinous
cube.

02:41:13.448 --> 02:41:16.191
MATT: All right, so it makes a strength saving
throw.

02:41:16.191 --> 02:41:20.021
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, that's correct, against my DC of 15.

02:41:20.922 --> 02:41:21.949
MATT: Natural one.

02:41:21.949 --> 02:41:23.853
(cheering)

02:41:23.853 --> 02:41:25.355
TRAVIS: Number five tonight?

02:41:25.355 --> 02:41:27.248
MATT: Yep.

02:41:27.248 --> 02:41:37.121
LIAM: On a failed save the target takes 2d6
bludgeoning damage, so that is a seven and it's

02:41:37.121 --> 02:41:42.467
restrained for the spell's duration. So it attacks
at disadvantage and you attack at advantage.

02:41:42.467 --> 02:41:43.884
TRAVIS: Great.

02:41:43.884 --> 02:41:46.793
MARISHA: We attack at advantage? For how long?

02:41:46.793 --> 02:41:50.453
LIAM: There is a giant, earthen cat's claw holding
it on the corner.

02:41:50.491 --> 02:41:52.329
TRAVIS: Zero speed, or slow speed?

02:41:52.329 --> 02:41:54.161
SAM: It can be restrained, that thing?

02:41:54.161 --> 02:41:56.519
LAURA: Can it? By magic, maybe.

02:41:56.519 --> 02:41:58.436
MATT: Yeah, magic holds it in place.

02:41:58.436 --> 02:42:00.808
TRAVIS: So it's zero speed, it doesn't go
anywhere?

02:42:00.808 --> 02:42:03.740
LIAM: Restrained, it's the restrained condition.

02:42:03.740 --> 02:42:06.283
MATT: Correct, yep, for the spell's duration.

02:42:06.283 --> 02:42:08.472
LAURA: How long does the spell last?

02:42:08.472 --> 02:42:09.810
MATT: One minute.

02:42:09.810 --> 02:42:11.997
(cheering)

02:42:11.997 --> 02:42:13.632
MARISHA: Is it concentration?

02:42:13.632 --> 02:42:14.976
LIAM: Yes, it is.

02:42:14.976 --> 02:42:17.098
MARISHA: Don't break that concentration!

02:42:17.098 --> 02:42:23.084
MATT: This giant cat paw has grasped around and is
holding the cube in place, its claws dug into it,

02:42:23.084 --> 02:42:24.996
made of earth and dirt and stone.

02:42:24.996 --> 02:42:28.305
LIAM: I have a question, is there any light in
here at all?

02:42:28.305 --> 02:42:30.095
MATT: Aside from the torch that Yasha has, no.

02:42:30.095 --> 02:42:31.650
LIAM: Okay so there's dim light then, from the
torch.

02:42:31.650 --> 02:42:33.074
MATT: There is, yeah.

02:42:33.074 --> 02:42:34.583
LIAM: Because my globules are gone.

02:42:34.583 --> 02:42:36.968
MATT: Yes, they are very gone. Well, the torch has
been your main light source since you--

02:42:36.968 --> 02:42:40.573
LIAM: That's correct, thank you. Okay. And then I
sit.

02:42:40.573 --> 02:42:42.315
SAM: You're going to sit on the floor?

02:42:42.315 --> 02:42:43.761
LIAM: Yeah.

02:42:43.761 --> 02:42:45.332
MATT: You want Frumpkin to move anywhere?

02:42:45.332 --> 02:42:46.333
LIAM: Say again?

02:42:46.333 --> 02:42:47.470
MATT: Frumpkin's still back here.

02:42:47.470 --> 02:42:57.910
LIAM: Frumpkin can do whatever. Frumpkin will run
towards Jester and get between-- where's Nott?

02:42:59.119 --> 02:43:00.441
MATT: Nott is over there.

02:43:00.441 --> 02:43:04.980
LIAM: Frumpkin will stand between Jester and the
cube.

02:43:04.980 --> 02:43:10.511
MATT: All righty, that ends Caleb's turn. Jester,
you're up.

02:43:12.211 --> 02:43:15.619
TRAVIS: Is this considered a monstrosity?

02:43:15.929 --> 02:43:19.895
MATT: No, it is not. It is considered an ooze.

02:43:19.895 --> 02:43:21.201
TRAVIS: An ooze?

02:43:21.201 --> 02:43:23.225
MARISHA: Jell-o!

02:43:23.589 --> 02:43:25.657
LAURA: I'm going to back up away from it.

02:43:25.657 --> 02:43:28.550
ASHLEY: Kill the box, Jester.

02:43:28.550 --> 02:43:36.672
LAURA: I'm going to use the Sacred Flame cantrip
because I figure it's not very dextrous.

02:43:36.672 --> 02:43:39.504
LIAM: Everybody has advantage on attack rolls.

02:43:39.504 --> 02:43:43.510
MATT: That is going to be a three. What's the
damage on that?

02:43:43.510 --> 02:43:45.362
LAURA: It's a 1d8 radiant damage.

02:43:45.362 --> 02:43:46.498
MATT: Go for it.

02:43:46.498 --> 02:43:47.738
LAURA: Six!

02:43:47.738 --> 02:43:52.899
MATT: Six points of radiant damage. As this flame
bursts at the side of it, part of it jello-wiggles

02:43:53.023 --> 02:43:54.387
for a second.

02:43:54.387 --> 02:43:56.592
LAURA: Did it look like it did anything to it?

02:43:56.592 --> 02:44:00.860
MATT: It looked like it hurt it maybe, but it just
looks like it's a big gelatinous cube.

02:44:00.860 --> 02:44:04.835
TALIESIN: The radiant didn't seem to have an extra
effect then?

02:44:04.835 --> 02:44:05.764
MATT: No, it did not.

02:44:05.764 --> 02:44:07.179
TALIESIN and LAURA: Okay.

02:44:07.179 --> 02:44:09.669
MATT: Does that finish your turn?

02:44:09.669 --> 02:44:12.064
LAURA: Yes.

02:44:12.451 --> 02:44:16.562
MATT: All right, end of Jester's turn. Beau and
Yasha, you guys are up.

02:44:16.562 --> 02:44:20.213
LIAM: Beauyasha. Do it up.

02:44:21.024 --> 02:44:22.995
ASHLEY: Lady.

02:44:22.995 --> 02:44:25.272
MARISHA: Do we just slap jello?

02:44:25.371 --> 02:44:26.397
ASHLEY: I think.

02:44:26.397 --> 02:44:29.637
MARISHA: I'm going to do a full-on--

02:44:31.420 --> 02:44:32.953
LIAM: Jello shots!

02:44:32.953 --> 02:44:35.398
MARISHA: Yeah, doing a full-on jello shot.

02:44:35.398 --> 02:44:37.902
MATT: Moving into it to assault it? Go for it.

02:44:38.918 --> 02:44:44.277
MARISHA: That's good, that's an 18! Plus six, so
24?

02:44:44.277 --> 02:44:46.079
MATT: That definitely hits.

02:44:46.485 --> 02:44:51.069
MARISHA: Seven plus four, 11.

02:44:51.069 --> 02:44:52.305
MATT: 11 points of damage?

02:44:52.305 --> 02:44:53.630
LIAM: You did it at advantage?

02:44:53.630 --> 02:44:54.804
MARISHA: No.

02:44:54.804 --> 02:44:56.330
LIAM: Go for the 20!

02:44:56.330 --> 02:44:59.578
MARISHA: Okay, I'll go for the 20, in case I roll
a natural 20. I did not roll a natural 20.

02:44:59.578 --> 02:45:03.969
MATT: So 11 points of damage with your hit as you
slam it with the side of your staff. It shivers

02:45:03.969 --> 02:45:09.118
and shakes at the impact and your staff slides
through and barely emerges through the opposite

02:45:09.118 --> 02:45:12.795
side of it, seemingly closing around and reforming
where the gap was carved through.

02:45:12.795 --> 02:45:14.467
MARISHA: Does it feel like I did some damage?

02:45:14.467 --> 02:45:15.945
MATT: Maybe.

02:45:15.945 --> 02:45:21.157
MARISHA: Okay, I'll take my bonus and whack. Or
you know what? Yeah, I'm going to whack it.

02:45:21.157 --> 02:45:22.999
MATT: All right, so you're going to punch it.

02:45:22.999 --> 02:45:25.068
SAM, LAURA, and MARISHA: Slap that jello.

02:45:25.068 --> 02:45:27.237
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: Slap-a the bass!

02:45:28.616 --> 02:45:30.639
MARISHA: That's good! That's 21.

02:45:30.639 --> 02:45:32.038
LAURA: Is there something in it?

02:45:32.038 --> 02:45:33.345
LIAM: Yeah, bones.

02:45:33.345 --> 02:45:34.877
MARISHA: Six damage.

02:45:34.877 --> 02:45:36.328
TRAVIS: There is something in it!

02:45:36.328 --> 02:45:40.701
MATT: Six damage, all right. As you sock it with
your fist, it quakes. As you pull your hand back,

02:45:40.701 --> 02:45:43.154
your whole hand goes numb.

02:45:43.154 --> 02:45:44.357
SAM: Oh no.

02:45:44.357 --> 02:45:49.256
MATT: All feeling is lost from almost partway down
your arm, and you're like, oh, that's--

02:45:49.256 --> 02:45:51.612
MARISHA: It's like that pins and needles thing?

02:45:51.612 --> 02:45:53.277
ASHLEY: It's a weird feeling?

02:45:53.277 --> 02:45:56.241
MARISHA: Yeah, like, dead arm. It's a little
dead.

02:45:56.241 --> 02:45:58.447
TALIESIN: Are you staying next to it or you--

02:45:58.447 --> 02:46:02.813
LAURA: Back away from it. What if a tentacle comes
out of it or something?

02:46:02.813 --> 02:46:04.471
MARISHA: Where's Yasha?

02:46:04.471 --> 02:46:06.813
ASHLEY: Your right.

02:46:06.813 --> 02:46:10.978
MARISHA: Can I go around near Frumpkin and flank
it?

02:46:10.978 --> 02:46:12.798
MATT: You can move around--

02:46:12.798 --> 02:46:14.397
MARISHA: That's good. That's fine.

02:46:14.397 --> 02:46:15.807
LIAM: Don't step on my cat.

02:46:15.807 --> 02:46:17.234
MATT: All righty. Yasha, you're up.

02:46:17.234 --> 02:46:27.851
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm going to rage? I would like to
rage. Well wait, maybe I don't really need to do

02:46:27.851 --> 02:46:30.399
that because we have advantage anyway.

02:46:30.399 --> 02:46:32.289
TALIESIN: Yeah, you don't need to.

02:46:32.289 --> 02:46:34.159
LAURA: There's no harm in raging.

02:46:34.159 --> 02:46:35.518
ASHLEY: Divine Fury.

02:46:35.518 --> 02:46:37.052
MATT: Are you moving in to assault it?

02:46:37.052 --> 02:46:38.206
ASHLEY: Yep.

02:46:38.206 --> 02:46:40.170
LAURA: Assault it!

02:46:40.170 --> 02:46:43.115
ASHLEY: I'm going to do that again.

02:46:44.877 --> 02:46:47.156
LAURA: Advantage. She has advantage because--

02:46:47.156 --> 02:46:48.672
MATT: Oh, right. Because the--

02:46:48.672 --> 02:46:50.522
ASHLEY: Eight!

02:46:50.522 --> 02:46:51.804
MATT: Still hits.

02:46:51.804 --> 02:46:52.931
ASHLEY: It still hits?!

02:46:52.931 --> 02:46:54.011
LAURA: It's a cube!

02:46:54.011 --> 02:47:02.955
MATT: It's not hard to hit. It's a giant,
quivering cube. Roll damage. 2d6 plus five plus

02:47:02.955 --> 02:47:07.246
your 1d6 plus two, I think?

02:47:07.246 --> 02:47:08.774
LAURA: Did she get-- oh, nevermind.

02:47:08.774 --> 02:47:10.747
MATT: 3d6 plus seven.

02:47:12.880 --> 02:47:14.039
ASHLEY: 17.

02:47:14.039 --> 02:47:15.686
SAM: Because it's her strength?

02:47:15.793 --> 02:47:17.201
LAURA: No, it's more than that!

02:47:17.201 --> 02:47:18.058
ASHLEY: It is?

02:47:18.058 --> 02:47:21.395
LAURA: Here's ten, plus five, 15.

02:47:21.395 --> 02:47:26.731
MATT: 15 plus two for rage, three for strength,
and plus two for your--

02:47:26.731 --> 02:47:28.202
ASHLEY: 17.

02:47:28.202 --> 02:47:31.022
TRAVIS: 22, 24.

02:47:31.022 --> 02:47:33.849
ASHLEY: Yeah. Wait. 21.

02:47:33.849 --> 02:47:40.931
MATT: 21 points of damage. As you carve through,
you actually watch a corner of it slide off and

02:47:40.931 --> 02:47:47.115
turn to sludge and water on the ground. Your blade
cuts through a section of it and (wet wobbling sound).

02:47:47.171 --> 02:47:48.136
ASHLEY: Nothing.

02:47:48.136 --> 02:47:49.182
MATT: No, it hurt it.

02:47:49.182 --> 02:47:50.108
LAURA: 22.

02:47:50.108 --> 02:47:50.978
ASHLEY: It did?

02:47:50.978 --> 02:47:51.772
SAM: You did great!

02:47:51.772 --> 02:47:52.664
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:47:52.664 --> 02:47:53.624
SAM: Way to go, Yasha!

02:47:53.624 --> 02:47:56.446
ASHLEY: But what-- I don't see anything
happening!

02:47:56.446 --> 02:47:58.081
TRAVIS: It's a big cube of sludge.

02:47:58.081 --> 02:47:59.710
ASHLEY: Did it change shape at all?

02:47:59.710 --> 02:48:04.240
MATT: No, it's still cubic. You carved through a
portion of it. All right, does that finish your turn?

02:48:04.372 --> 02:48:06.139
ASHLEY: I'm going to back up a little bit.

02:48:06.139 --> 02:48:09.142
MATT: All right, so you want to back up a little
bit? As you pull back a little bit, it gets one

02:48:09.142 --> 02:48:11.143
swing at you with a pseudopod. Part of it--

02:48:11.143 --> 02:48:12.567
LIAM: At disadvantage!

02:48:12.567 --> 02:48:14.218
MATT: --(sploosh) swings out at you-- yes, it
does.

02:48:14.218 --> 02:48:15.371
MARISHA: And I hit it with Sentinel!

02:48:15.371 --> 02:48:16.394
MATT: You do.

02:48:16.394 --> 02:48:18.430
LIAM and MARISHA: At advantage!

02:48:18.430 --> 02:48:24.838
MATT: It rolled pretty well for having
disadvantage. That would be a total of 16 to hit.

02:48:24.838 --> 02:48:26.006
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:48:26.006 --> 02:48:27.339
MATT: Okay.

02:48:27.339 --> 02:48:28.396
SAM: Yasha!

02:48:28.396 --> 02:48:30.201
LAURA: Stupid cube!

02:48:30.201 --> 02:48:37.661
MATT: You take 13 points of acid damage, as it
slams into you and begins to burn the skin.

02:48:38.175 --> 02:48:40.425
TALIESIN: Does that get halved because of raging?

02:48:40.425 --> 02:48:44.494
MATT: Acid damage is not halved, unfortunately.
And you strike it?

02:48:44.494 --> 02:48:45.609
MARISHA: I rolled a 15.

02:48:45.609 --> 02:48:47.251
MATT: That hits. Roll damage.

02:48:47.251 --> 02:48:48.664
MARISHA: Six damage.

02:48:48.664 --> 02:48:50.827
MATT: Six damage? All righty.

02:48:50.827 --> 02:48:53.011
MARISHA: Yeah. These are all my unarmed strikes,
yeah?

02:48:53.150 --> 02:48:57.851
MATT: Yes. You punch with your other hand and now
both of your hands are numb and you're like, "Ugh!"

02:48:57.931 --> 02:48:59.664
MARISHA: I hate that feeling!

02:48:59.664 --> 02:49:01.058
TRAVIS: Novocaine hands?

02:49:01.058 --> 02:49:02.730
MARISHA: Yeah!

02:49:02.730 --> 02:49:06.338
MATT: Your whole torso, Yasha, is burning, and
underneath the burning pain you feel numbness

02:49:06.338 --> 02:49:10.065
under your chin and your tongue's going a little
(lolling).

02:49:10.065 --> 02:49:12.263
LAURA: Oh no! Is she poisoned?

02:49:12.263 --> 02:49:14.244
MATT: Molly, you're up.

02:49:14.244 --> 02:49:20.652
TALIESIN: I'm going to try, just for shits and
giggles, I'm going to activate the ice damage on

02:49:20.652 --> 02:49:27.622
my sword. I'm going to run up-- where am I? Over
there? I'm going to run up, take a swing at that corner--

02:49:27.744 --> 02:49:30.773
MATT: Okay, you dash up to its side there.

02:49:30.773 --> 02:49:35.605
TALIESIN: So that's 14 to hit.

02:49:35.605 --> 02:49:37.202
MATT: 14 hits!

02:49:37.202 --> 02:49:45.282
TALIESIN: I know, it's like, just in case, I will
be the one to miss. And that's six plus one ice,

02:49:45.282 --> 02:49:47.556
so that's seven damage.

02:49:47.756 --> 02:49:53.838
MATT: Seven damage, nice. You strike through and
the ice crystallizes inside. As you cut through,

02:49:53.838 --> 02:49:57.396
the liquid and the moisture (shattering) leaves
this--

02:49:57.396 --> 02:49:58.527
TRAVIS: Like ballistic gel?

02:49:58.527 --> 02:50:01.070
MATT: Yeah. Stuck in the inside. So that's one
carved through.

02:50:01.070 --> 02:50:03.461
TALIESIN: It's my bonus to activate it.

02:50:03.461 --> 02:50:05.456
MATT: Right, so it's your one strike.

02:50:05.456 --> 02:50:07.677
TALIESIN: I'm going to back off into the corner
then.

02:50:07.765 --> 02:50:08.905
MATT: It already used its reaction.

02:50:08.905 --> 02:50:10.656
TALIESIN: Yeah, so I'm using that.

02:50:10.656 --> 02:50:14.934
MATT: You strike and then dart back, jump to the
back of the room getting ready for you next round.

02:50:14.934 --> 02:50:17.721
That finishes Molly's round. Nott and Fjord,
you're up.

02:50:17.721 --> 02:50:19.922
TRAVIS: Ladies first.

02:50:19.922 --> 02:50:28.779
SAM: Yes, I feel so conflicted trying to hurt a
cube. But I will. I will bash that cube until it

02:50:28.779 --> 02:50:31.225
explodes all over the place. Wait.

02:50:31.225 --> 02:50:33.049
TALIESIN: Whoa!

02:50:33.049 --> 02:50:39.279
SAM: I rolled a natural 20 to attack with my hand
crossbow.

02:50:39.279 --> 02:50:41.073
MATT: Roll damage on that.

02:50:41.073 --> 02:50:42.711
SAM: With sneak attack?

02:50:42.711 --> 02:50:45.584
MATT: Technically, yes, you have Beau.

02:50:45.584 --> 02:50:47.962
SAM: And it's crit so double?

02:50:47.962 --> 02:50:50.454
MATT: Double dice and then add your dexterity
modifier.

02:50:50.454 --> 02:50:52.173
SAM: 24, plus--

02:50:52.922 --> 02:50:55.004
28.

02:50:55.004 --> 02:50:56.590
MATT: Shit!

02:50:56.590 --> 02:51:01.743
SAM: Oh, and I'll use Fury of the Small to make it
30!

02:51:01.743 --> 02:51:04.279
LIAM: I want to roll a rogue <i>right now</i>!

02:51:04.279 --> 02:51:05.490
LAURA: I know, right?

02:51:05.490 --> 02:51:07.423
MATT: Is it half your level, or is it your level?

02:51:07.423 --> 02:51:08.816
SAM: Fury of the Small. Let me look.

02:51:08.816 --> 02:51:10.104
MATT: It's damage equal to your level, right?

02:51:10.104 --> 02:51:11.139
SAM: Yes.

02:51:11.139 --> 02:51:12.890
MATT: That's an additional four so that's 32
damage.

02:51:12.890 --> 02:51:14.326
SAM: Oh, shit!

02:51:14.326 --> 02:51:15.933
LIAM: That builds, goblin?

02:51:15.933 --> 02:51:17.614
SAM: Class features.

02:51:17.614 --> 02:51:19.568
MATT: I'm pretty sure it's equal to your level.

02:51:19.568 --> 02:51:20.852
SAM: I'm looking.

02:51:20.852 --> 02:51:22.198
TALIESIN: Is it racial features or class
features?

02:51:22.198 --> 02:51:24.493
SAM: I don't know. I'll look it up later!

02:51:24.516 --> 02:51:26.743
TALIESIN: It would be racial features.

02:51:26.743 --> 02:51:32.008
SAM: For which archetype? Spellcasting, Mage Hand?
Oh shit, I should've used Mage Hand before!

02:51:32.008 --> 02:51:35.852
MATT: (laughs) Remember, that's actually your
archetype.

02:51:35.852 --> 02:51:37.483
SAM: I don't know what I should be doing!

02:51:37.483 --> 02:51:38.382
TALIESIN: Class features.

02:51:38.382 --> 02:51:41.901
MATT: Regardless, you did a lot of damage to it,
so 32 with your level added to it, as you strike

02:51:41.901 --> 02:51:43.856
it with your crossbow.

02:51:43.856 --> 02:51:50.158
SAM: Okay. Then I will move around that way, yes,
as far as possible.

02:51:50.921 --> 02:51:52.653
MATT: 30.

02:51:52.653 --> 02:51:56.666
SAM: And I'll shoot again. Why not? With advantage
still?

02:51:56.666 --> 02:51:58.248
LIAM: It's restrained.

02:51:58.248 --> 02:52:00.542
SAM: 18 plus a lot.

02:52:00.542 --> 02:52:02.908
MATT: That hits. Roll damage.

02:52:04.268 --> 02:52:06.480
SAM: Seven more points of damage.

02:52:07.246 --> 02:52:11.127
MATT: 39 points of damage in one round of combat.
Not too bad!

02:52:11.127 --> 02:52:12.392
ASHLEY: Nicely done!

02:52:12.392 --> 02:52:16.276
LIAM: Low-level rogue! High-level rogue, eh, but
low-level rogue is sick.

02:52:16.276 --> 02:52:18.939
LAURA: High-level rogue was still pretty cool.

02:52:18.939 --> 02:52:22.933
MARISHA: What was it, like 79 points of damage you
did in one round?

02:52:22.933 --> 02:52:23.468
LIAM: One time.

02:52:23.468 --> 02:52:24.688
MARISHA: Yeah, that was great.

02:52:24.688 --> 02:52:27.798
MATT: That ends Nott's turn. Fjord, what are you
doing?

02:52:27.798 --> 02:52:31.521
TRAVIS: I'm going to use my speed to run on this
side of the cube closer to you, as far back

02:52:31.521 --> 02:52:33.408
against that wall as possible.

02:52:33.408 --> 02:52:36.180
MATT: 25. Right there. 30 will be all the way
back.

02:52:36.180 --> 02:52:39.401
TRAVIS: 30's perfect. Eldritch Blast.

02:52:39.401 --> 02:52:40.909
MATT: Go for it.

02:52:40.909 --> 02:52:45.606
TRAVIS: At advantage. That's cocked. That natural
19's not bad, though.

02:52:45.606 --> 02:52:47.001
MATT: That'll hit. Roll damage.

02:52:47.001 --> 02:52:51.929
TRAVIS: Great. Ten plus four, that's 14 points of
damage.

02:52:51.929 --> 02:52:56.933
MATT: 14 points of damage. This thing is just
getting hit with crossbow bolts and the blasts on

02:52:57.166 --> 02:53:03.567
the sides of it. It's taking damage, but it's a
hardy mass of slime and gelatin.

02:53:03.567 --> 02:53:04.938
TRAVIS: It's a hardy mallow.

02:53:04.938 --> 02:53:06.392
MATT: Indeed. That finish your turn?

02:53:06.392 --> 02:53:07.095
TRAVIS: Yes, it does.

02:53:07.095 --> 02:53:11.299
MATT: All righty, it's now the gelatinous cube's
turn. It's going to attempt to break free of the

02:53:11.299 --> 02:53:14.585
large Earthen Paw.

02:53:14.585 --> 02:53:16.100
TALIESIN: At disadvantage.

02:53:16.100 --> 02:53:17.494
MATT: Well, it's not disadvantage.

02:53:17.494 --> 02:53:18.797
LIAM: Just for attacks.

02:53:18.797 --> 02:53:20.821
MATT: That is going to be-- what save?

02:53:20.821 --> 02:53:22.452
LIAM: 15 for me.

02:53:22.452 --> 02:53:26.091
MATT: It's a strength check. So that would be plus
two, that's a 15.

02:53:26.091 --> 02:53:28.137
LIAM: <i>Gott verdammt!</i> It's out.

02:53:28.137 --> 02:53:29.868
LAURA: Oh no, it breaks free?!

02:53:29.868 --> 02:53:33.745
TRAVIS: No, I thought it was going to stay there!

02:53:33.745 --> 02:53:37.134
LAURA: Beau's right next to it. It's going to
slurp you.

02:53:37.134 --> 02:53:38.604
LIAM: Does that mean it's not restrained?

02:53:38.604 --> 02:53:42.087
MATT: No, it can still move as part of its
action.

02:53:42.087 --> 02:53:42.814
TRAVIS: Shit!

02:53:42.814 --> 02:53:45.218
LAURA: Half of its movement.

02:53:45.218 --> 02:53:48.331
MATT: It's going to (squelching).

02:53:48.331 --> 02:53:50.544
LAURA: Oh no. Who's it going for?!

02:53:50.544 --> 02:53:55.573
LIAM: Who's it getting? My cat?! You
motherfucker!

02:53:55.573 --> 02:54:01.742
(screaming and laughter)

02:54:01.742 --> 02:54:02.246
LAURA: No!

02:54:02.246 --> 02:54:07.519
LIAM: I mean, I'm assuming it takes like four
points of damage immediately, my cat.

02:54:07.519 --> 02:54:09.261
TRAVIS: How many hit points does it have?

02:54:09.261 --> 02:54:12.551
LIAM: Three? It's gone instantly!

02:54:12.551 --> 02:54:14.623
MARISHA: Did any of that trigger my sentinel?

02:54:14.623 --> 02:54:20.323
MATT: Your cat moved aside. I did that to fuck
with you. Its engulf is an action, and it already

02:54:20.323 --> 02:54:23.752
used an action to break free. But it did move over
and you guys basically moved out of the way. It's

02:54:23.752 --> 02:54:26.358
now right next to both Beau and Jester.

02:54:26.358 --> 02:54:28.167
MARISHA: It didn't move out of my range at all?

02:54:28.167 --> 02:54:31.180
MATT: It did not. You've already used your
reaction anyway.

02:54:31.180 --> 02:54:37.246
SAM: Can I say that it looks like that artisanal
ice that you get at really classy bars, and now

02:54:37.246 --> 02:54:39.215
I'm really thirsty for like a scotch.

02:54:39.215 --> 02:54:44.832
MATT: That's going to end its turn. That brings us
to the top of the round. That is Caleb.

02:54:44.832 --> 02:54:48.849
LIAM: I believe my Cat's Paw is still in existence
and would like to try to do the same shit.

02:54:48.849 --> 02:54:49.802
MATT: Okay.

02:54:49.802 --> 02:54:57.522
LIAM: So. (swiping) (meow) 15. It can move as
well.

02:54:57.522 --> 02:55:00.292
SAM: It's like Bigby's Paw?

02:55:00.292 --> 02:55:01.294
LIAM: It is.

02:55:01.294 --> 02:55:02.741
MATT: You can move it?

02:55:02.741 --> 02:55:05.214
LIAM: Yeah, I can.

02:55:05.214 --> 02:55:08.061
TRAVIS: Bigby's Dirty, Dirty Cat Paw?

02:55:08.061 --> 02:55:10.089
LIAM: Looking it up.

02:55:10.089 --> 02:55:13.772
MATT: Reaches for one creature it can see within
five feet of it.

02:55:13.772 --> 02:55:18.799
LIAM: Did it get five feet? It was five feet in
front of it and it moved that way. It would've

02:55:18.799 --> 02:55:19.474
been right in front of it.

02:55:19.474 --> 02:55:20.277
MATT: Sure, we'll go for it.

02:55:20.277 --> 02:55:22.282
LIAM: All right, so DC 15.

02:55:22.503 --> 02:55:24.516
MATT: DC 15 on what? What's the save on it?

02:55:24.516 --> 02:55:25.741
LIAM: It's strength.

02:55:25.741 --> 02:55:30.033
MATT: Right, strength again. That's a 14 plus two,
16.

02:55:30.033 --> 02:55:36.181
LIAM: Aw, it doesn't do it. Great. I will use the
rest of my movement to move another ten feet back

02:55:36.181 --> 02:55:37.372
in the hallway I'm in.

02:55:37.372 --> 02:55:42.823
MATT: Okay. Slowly backing away. As you step on
that platform back there, you feel it buzz for a

02:55:42.823 --> 02:55:52.412
second, and nearby you hear this whining of metal
against metal as the trap is still broken but

02:55:52.412 --> 02:55:57.182
waiting. That ends Caleb's go. Jester, you're up.

02:55:57.182 --> 02:56:01.975
LAURA: Oh man, and it's right next to me now? Oh
god! Okay.

02:56:01.975 --> 02:56:04.468
TRAVIS: (sings) It's right next to me now!

02:56:04.468 --> 02:56:07.884
LAURA: Ooh, I'm going to cast Toll the Dead on it.

02:56:07.884 --> 02:56:11.600
MATT: All right. Save on that is constitution?

02:56:11.600 --> 02:56:13.314
LAURA: It's a wisdom save!

02:56:13.314 --> 02:56:15.943
MATT: Wisdom save! That is strangely a 14.

02:56:15.943 --> 02:56:17.454
LAURA: Also 14.

02:56:17.454 --> 02:56:21.607
MATT: Oh shit, yeah. 16 minus 2. So no effect.

02:56:21.607 --> 02:56:22.909
LAURA: Balls. Okay.

02:56:22.909 --> 02:56:24.400
ASHLEY: Wait, don't you get an advant-- no.

02:56:24.400 --> 02:56:26.336
TALIESIN: Advantage is over.

02:56:27.516 --> 02:56:34.563
LAURA: Okay, then I guess I'm going to (singing)
try to back away from it.

02:56:34.563 --> 02:56:35.442
MATT: Which way?

02:56:37.492 --> 02:56:38.782
LAURA: Towards Fjord.

02:56:38.782 --> 02:56:41.210
MATT: Towards Fjord? So you're going to back away
here?

02:56:43.500 --> 02:56:45.297
LAURA: A little further if I can, please.

02:56:45.297 --> 02:56:45.819
MATT: You can.

02:56:45.819 --> 02:56:48.615
LAURA: Because it probably can't move very far.

02:56:48.615 --> 02:56:55.318
MATT: It's going to swing at you with its
pseudopod as you move out of its range. That's a

02:56:55.752 --> 02:56:56.374
natural 20.

02:56:56.374 --> 02:56:59.860
LAURA: Bitch of a fucking marshmallow!

02:56:59.860 --> 02:57:04.510
MATT: That's some good rolls in the past couple of
rounds. That's going to be-- ooh! 32 points of

02:57:04.510 --> 02:57:05.503
acid damage.

02:57:05.503 --> 02:57:07.375
ALL: Oh!

02:57:07.375 --> 02:57:08.780
SAM: That's <i>all</i> the points!

02:57:08.780 --> 02:57:09.389
LIAM: She's out!

02:57:09.389 --> 02:57:10.757
LAURA: I'm out. I'm unconscious.

02:57:10.757 --> 02:57:12.009
LIAM: Was she absorbed?

02:57:12.009 --> 02:57:15.956
MATT: I rolled-- it's 3d6. Six, four, six,
doubled.

02:57:15.956 --> 02:57:17.541
LIAM: Is she absorbed?

02:57:17.541 --> 02:57:18.969
LAURA and MATT: No.

02:57:18.969 --> 02:57:20.527
MARISHA: It got a natural 20.

02:57:20.527 --> 02:57:23.526
MATT: Not at the moment. So you are unconscious
right next to--

02:57:23.526 --> 02:57:25.270
ASHLEY: Wait, but she wasn't that close to him!

02:57:25.270 --> 02:57:26.675
LAURA: I was.

02:57:26.675 --> 02:57:27.957
MATT: She tried to move away.

02:57:27.957 --> 02:57:28.539
ASHLEY: Shit.

02:57:29.719 --> 02:57:35.367
MATT: So it hits you from behind, and the last
thing you feel is numbness overtake your body as

02:57:35.367 --> 02:57:38.155
darkness clouds around your eyes and you are out.

02:57:38.155 --> 02:57:40.880
SAM: Jester, like all beautiful women, succumbed
to the cube.

02:57:40.880 --> 02:57:41.688
LAURA: Yeah.

02:57:42.728 --> 02:57:43.440
TALIESIN: What?!

02:57:44.740 --> 02:57:49.655
LAURA: If I die tonight, when I decided to come
and play even though I'm coughing--

02:57:50.495 --> 02:57:55.088
MATT: I'm sorry. That ends Jester's turn. That
brings us to Beau and Yasha.

02:57:55.088 --> 02:58:00.796
MARISHA: And that, I wouldn't have-- Okay. I
already got my one reaction?

02:58:01.496 --> 02:58:02.421
MATT: Well, it's your turn.

02:58:02.421 --> 02:58:05.408
MARISHA: I feel like that was before, though, the
one reaction.

02:58:07.238 --> 02:58:08.642
TRAVIS: I'm coming for her.

02:58:08.642 --> 02:58:12.828
MARISHA: The first one. With it being one more
round, do I have a reaction?

02:58:12.828 --> 02:58:17.123
MATT: No, because that was happening during--
That's since your last turn. So your reaction has

02:58:17.123 --> 02:58:20.616
come back now. You don't get an attack, but now
you do after this. It's your turn.

02:58:22.266 --> 02:58:25.913
MARISHA: It's me and Yasha.

02:58:27.483 --> 02:58:29.632
SAM: Yasha's a healer, right?

02:58:29.632 --> 02:58:32.608
ASHLEY: Wait, didn't you get Sentinel on it?

02:58:32.608 --> 02:58:41.029
MARISHA: I did on the round before. I feel like I
have one more round but I don't think I did. Did

02:58:41.029 --> 02:58:43.478
you, though? Because it moved out of your range!

02:58:43.478 --> 02:58:46.687
MATT: It did, but you guys have the same
initiative round. So you used your reaction on

02:58:46.687 --> 02:58:52.086
your turn last round to hit it, as she was running
away, and now it's reset to this round.

02:58:52.086 --> 02:58:53.274
MARISHA: But did Yasha?

02:58:53.274 --> 02:58:59.130
MATT: Yasha hasn't, no. Yasha ran out of range and
hasn't been able to use her reaction to hit since then.

02:58:59.480 --> 02:59:01.760
MARISHA: Oh, she ran out of range. Okay.

02:59:02.239 --> 02:59:05.857
MATT: That's how you got the attack on it. She ran
away and it hit her, and then you got a shot.

02:59:05.857 --> 02:59:11.504
MARISHA: I was thinking there was another round in
between that. I'm going to lay into it.

02:59:12.274 --> 02:59:14.872
MATT: All right. So you're staying where you are
and start--

02:59:15.252 --> 02:59:16.095
MARISHA: Wait. Wait.

02:59:18.485 --> 02:59:22.505
ALL: Wait. Wait. Wait.

02:59:24.705 --> 02:59:26.675
LAURA: I'm going to die, you guys.

02:59:27.205 --> 02:59:28.828
SAM: You'll be fine!

02:59:28.828 --> 02:59:30.877
LIAM: No, probably you'll die.

02:59:30.877 --> 02:59:37.829
MARISHA: Caleb, you already went. You're going to
give it to her? Okay. Then I'll lay into it.

02:59:37.829 --> 02:59:39.677
MATT: All right, go for it.

02:59:39.677 --> 02:59:42.499
MARISHA: Sorry, I wanted to make sure someone was
going to get Jester out.

02:59:42.499 --> 02:59:43.627
TRAVIS: I'm leaving her behind.

02:59:43.627 --> 02:59:44.314
MARISHA: 21.

02:59:44.314 --> 02:59:45.403
MATT: 21 hits!

02:59:45.403 --> 02:59:46.648
LAURA: When does the cube go?

02:59:46.648 --> 02:59:47.422
TRAVIS: Last.

02:59:47.422 --> 02:59:49.505
MARISHA: That's nine points of damage.

02:59:49.505 --> 02:59:54.794
MATT: Nine points of damage, nice. As you slap it
with the side of the bo again, you watch and it

02:59:54.794 --> 02:59:56.662
buckles in places.

02:59:56.662 --> 03:00:06.538
MARISHA: I'm going to go ahead and do Flurry of
Blows for these next two. That's a natural 18.

03:00:06.538 --> 03:00:07.972
MATT: That hits, definitely.

03:00:07.972 --> 03:00:15.499
MARISHA: So five points of damage. The second one.
That's not great. That's 11.

03:00:15.499 --> 03:00:16.299
MATT: Still hits.

03:00:16.299 --> 03:00:19.871
MARISHA: Great, and that's seven points of damage.

03:00:19.871 --> 03:00:28.801
MATT: You're punching this thing, and you're
watching it quiver and part of it is shifting and

03:00:28.801 --> 03:00:32.724
it's looking pretty damaged in spite of its size
at this point in time, so well done. Yasha, what

03:00:32.724 --> 03:00:33.551
are you doing?

03:00:33.551 --> 03:00:44.087
ASHLEY: All right, I'm going to go up to it. Get
it sliced. Raging, reckless. Divine-- no, I can't

03:00:44.087 --> 03:00:44.875
do divine.

03:00:44.875 --> 03:00:45.811
MATT: Yes, every turn you can do it.

03:00:45.811 --> 03:00:46.731
ASHLEY: Every turn I can do it.

03:00:46.731 --> 03:00:47.758
LIAM: Yasha!

03:00:51.468 --> 03:00:52.690
SAM: First roll to hit.

03:00:52.690 --> 03:00:55.499
ASHLEY: Oh! First roll to hit.

03:00:55.864 --> 03:00:57.626
MATT: With advantage, because you went reckless.

03:00:57.626 --> 03:00:59.749
ASHLEY: With advantage. Yeah, 20.

03:00:59.749 --> 03:01:08.436
MATT: Roll again, just in case. Reckless is good
because you have a double chance to critical.

03:01:08.436 --> 03:01:24.266
ASHLEY: Don't ever not do it, okay. 22.

03:01:24.266 --> 03:01:28.233
MATT: Yeah, that's it. 22 damage. How do you want
to do this?

03:01:28.233 --> 03:01:32.811
(cheering)

03:01:32.811 --> 03:01:33.627
TRAVIS: Is that your first one?

03:01:33.627 --> 03:01:34.464
ASHLEY: Yes!

03:01:34.464 --> 03:01:37.843
MATT: You see it being hit by Beau and it's slowly
shifting its weight towards the unconscious body

03:01:37.843 --> 03:01:41.553
of Jester on the ground. You watch it expanding to
start pulling her leg inward.

03:01:42.683 --> 03:01:49.281
ASHLEY: I take the tip of the sword, and I slowly
start pushing into the middle and then (sword

03:01:49.281 --> 03:01:50.296
slicing across).

03:01:50.296 --> 03:01:54.462
MATT: As you push it all the way into the center
of it, it begins to shake and quiver and begins to

03:01:54.462 --> 03:02:00.044
slowly encapsulate your arm and forearm as it
rises up, and your arm is numb. You shake your

03:02:00.044 --> 03:02:05.465
head and cut out to the side, and as you do, you
watch the side of it splash out, almost like

03:02:05.465 --> 03:02:09.982
popping a water balloon. The interior of it turns
to liquid water and begin to spill out as it

03:02:09.982 --> 03:02:15.040
slowly deflates and liquefies across the ground,
like a jellyfish beached.

03:02:15.040 --> 03:02:16.957
TRAVIS: Oh, I'm stepping in it.

03:02:18.497 --> 03:02:21.953
LIAM: Ashley, you just destroyed a classic
Dungeons &amp; Dragons foe.

03:02:21.953 --> 03:02:25.015
(clapping)

03:02:25.015 --> 03:02:31.241
MATT: I'll tell you one thing, that restraint
saved your fucking ass at the start! It never got

03:02:31.241 --> 03:02:33.751
to engulf. Never got a chance to engulf.

03:02:33.751 --> 03:02:39.669
TRAVIS: I'll run over, and I'll kneel down next to
Jester, and pick up her head and pour a health

03:02:39.669 --> 03:02:40.665
potion there.

03:02:40.665 --> 03:02:42.385
LIAM: (Imitating Jester) Put your tusk in there,
Fjord!

03:02:42.385 --> 03:02:44.556
(laughter)

03:02:44.556 --> 03:02:45.644
LAURA: Oh, Oskar.

03:02:45.644 --> 03:02:46.698
TRAVIS: Fjord.

03:02:46.698 --> 03:02:48.464
LAURA: Thank you for saving me.

03:02:48.464 --> 03:02:49.209
TRAVIS: It's Fjord.

03:02:50.219 --> 03:02:51.786
LAURA: Sorry, I mean Fjord.

03:02:51.786 --> 03:02:53.174
TRAVIS: Yeah. You all right?

03:02:53.714 --> 03:02:54.753
LAURA: Yes.

03:02:54.753 --> 03:02:57.596
TRAVIS: Okay. Get up, come on, on your feet.

03:02:57.596 --> 03:02:58.981
LAURA: Oh. Did we kill it?

03:02:58.981 --> 03:02:59.534
TRAVIS: Yup.

03:02:59.534 --> 03:03:02.200
LAURA: Sorry, I think that was my fault, you
guys.

03:03:02.200 --> 03:03:04.403
TALIESIN: No, these things happen.

03:03:04.403 --> 03:03:06.634
TRAVIS: Anything come out of the middle of that
thing?

03:03:08.734 --> 03:03:11.513
MATT: From the middle of it? No, it turns to
liquid gel.

03:03:11.513 --> 03:03:13.180
LIAM: Get my cat out of there.

03:03:14.230 --> 03:03:16.115
MATT: One of these days I'll get to put one of you
guys in.

03:03:16.115 --> 03:03:18.332
MARISHA: Aw, Frumpkin! Hey buddy.

03:03:18.332 --> 03:03:24.084
LIAM: From down the hallway you hear: Now the
question is, if we do the same thing again, will

03:03:24.084 --> 03:03:30.905
another one come out? Or do we need to try to hit
all three at the same time? Let me come in there.

03:03:32.235 --> 03:03:33.626
MATT: Actually, I guess I'll leave this here.

03:03:35.696 --> 03:03:37.080
LIAM: Leave it nearby.

03:03:37.710 --> 03:03:39.138
MATT: I'll set it aside.

03:03:39.138 --> 03:03:44.658
MARISHA: Well, if you hit all with everything at
once, then the worst that can happen is that we

03:03:44.658 --> 03:03:46.529
have to fight two more things at the same time.

03:03:46.529 --> 03:03:54.168
LIAM; Well, Jester did necrotic, and I can
obviously handle, well, I can handle evocation or--

03:03:54.531 --> 03:03:56.377
LAURA: Who has divination, though?

03:03:57.507 --> 03:04:07.120
MATT: What you didn't notice during this process
was the pillar above, the base re-closed.

03:04:09.480 --> 03:04:11.470
MARISHA: So we have to do it all at once.

03:04:11.470 --> 03:04:14.775
LIAM: I can do both divination and evocation.

03:04:14.775 --> 03:04:16.277
SAM: At the same time?

03:04:16.277 --> 03:04:17.725
LIAM: Can you do one of those things?

03:04:17.725 --> 03:04:22.054
SAM: I don't know. You taught me magic. What are
mine? What are my spells?

03:04:22.054 --> 03:04:24.153
LIAM: Well, tell me what you are able to do.

03:04:24.153 --> 03:04:26.415
SAM: Here, I'll show you on D&amp;D Beyond.

03:04:26.415 --> 03:04:28.306
TRAVIS: What are the last two? Divination and--

03:04:28.306 --> 03:04:30.278
LIAM: Divination and evocation.

03:04:30.278 --> 03:04:32.025
LAURA: Does anybody have one of those?

03:04:32.025 --> 03:04:36.087
SAM: Most of mine are illusion and something
else.

03:04:39.757 --> 03:04:42.716
LIAM: Yeah, you can do evocation with this one--

03:04:42.716 --> 03:04:44.384
SAM: Okay, I can do evocation!

03:04:44.384 --> 03:04:48.541
LIAM: But you have to get up there, though. You
have to touch it with that one.

03:04:48.541 --> 03:04:50.745
LAURA: Can your mage hand lift you up?

03:04:50.745 --> 03:04:53.684
SAM: No. But I can do climb!

03:04:53.684 --> 03:04:55.684
TALIESIN: Well, we have to do it in the bowl.

03:04:55.684 --> 03:04:57.307
SAM: Or we do it to the rod.

03:04:57.307 --> 03:04:58.839
TRAVIS: To the bowl.

03:04:58.839 --> 03:05:04.904
LIAM: So you handle evocation. I can handle the
divination. You handle necrotic.

03:05:04.904 --> 03:05:10.182
MATT: Where are the bowls placed right now? On the
symbols in the center?

03:05:10.182 --> 03:05:11.195
SAM: In the hole.

03:05:11.195 --> 03:05:12.519
MATT: What are you doing?

03:05:12.519 --> 03:05:16.630
SAM: I can do Shocking Grasp as a evocation
spell.

03:05:16.630 --> 03:05:23.263
LAURA: Wait. I have an idea. Maybe we should take
the bowls outside of the room and cast something

03:05:23.263 --> 03:05:29.362
on the bowls and see if one of the symbols on the
bowls light up. That way, the staff doesn't absorb

03:05:29.362 --> 03:05:36.260
the spell immediately. Because when I cast Toll
the Dead, I was trying to cast it on the bowl,

03:05:36.260 --> 03:05:43.198
right? But instead, my spell went up into the
middle of the staff. Maybe if we try casting it on

03:05:43.198 --> 03:05:45.890
the bowls outside of the room, that won't happen.

03:05:45.890 --> 03:05:47.902
SAM: Can't we cast it on the staff?

03:05:47.902 --> 03:05:55.004
TALIESIN: There is a room outside this room where
it seems like there was a room for maybe preparing

03:05:55.004 --> 03:05:55.505
the bowls?

03:05:55.505 --> 03:05:57.864
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's do that. Jester, lead the
way.

03:05:58.504 --> 03:06:01.785
LIAM: It is worth a try. Of course it is.

03:06:01.785 --> 03:06:04.381
LAURA: Just so we don't have to fight another
cube, just in case.

03:06:04.381 --> 03:06:09.640
LIAM: I'm pretty good. I have not let go all of my
preparation for the day.

03:06:11.490 --> 03:06:16.379
LAURA: How many points of healing did you give me?
When you poured the spell in my mouth?

03:06:16.379 --> 03:06:17.812
MATT: Was it a regular healing potion?

03:06:17.812 --> 03:06:18.783
TRAVIS: Yeah, just regular.

03:06:18.783 --> 03:06:20.140
MATT: 2d4 plus two.

03:06:21.740 --> 03:06:23.264
LIAM: Is everyone all right?

03:06:23.264 --> 03:06:23.878
TRAVIS: Six.

03:06:23.878 --> 03:06:25.562
LIAM: Jester, how are you feeling?

03:06:25.562 --> 03:06:29.794
LAURA: I'm feeling like I'm a little sick right
now, but you know.

03:06:29.794 --> 03:06:32.683
LIAM: No, not Laura but you: Jester. How are you
feeling?

03:06:32.683 --> 03:06:36.780
LAURA: I'm feel like I've got very little health.
Like I'm bleeding a little bit from my ears.

03:06:36.780 --> 03:06:39.186
LIAM: I reach into the satchel on the side.

03:06:39.186 --> 03:06:41.506
SAM: No. You keep it. I'll do it.

03:06:41.506 --> 03:06:46.515
LIAM: I give her my potion of healing. Regular
healing.

03:06:46.515 --> 03:06:49.205
LAURA: Caleb, I have healing spells still. It's
okay.

03:06:49.205 --> 03:06:51.239
LIAM: Well, what are you complaining about then?

03:06:51.239 --> 03:06:53.826
LAURA: I wasn't bitching at all! You asked.

03:06:53.826 --> 03:06:57.888
LIAM: That is not the verbiage that I chose at
all.

03:06:57.888 --> 03:07:00.605
SAM and ASHLEY: The "werbage".

03:07:00.605 --> 03:07:02.733
(laughter)

03:07:02.733 --> 03:07:04.118
TRAVIS: Wubba lubba "werbage"!

03:07:05.278 --> 03:07:07.710
LAURA: Let's fucking go out into this hallway,
okay?

03:07:07.710 --> 03:07:10.537
TRAVIS: Yeah. Beau and I take the bowls. We head
out into the hallway.

03:07:12.247 --> 03:07:17.712
MATT: You guys head out past the traps, carefully
stepping across the currently-held traps and you

03:07:17.712 --> 03:07:19.584
have the bowls in the far hallway.

03:07:19.584 --> 03:07:22.557
LAURA: Should we try casting a spell on one of the
bowls and see what happens?

03:07:22.557 --> 03:07:25.125
TRAVIS: Yeah. We lay all three of them, one, two,
three, out in a row.

03:07:25.125 --> 03:07:28.197
LIAM: Necro, evo, and divination all together.

03:07:28.197 --> 03:07:29.967
TRAVIS: Evo, you first. Pick a bowl.

03:07:29.967 --> 03:07:31.803
SAM: Wait, no. We have to do it instantaneously.

03:07:31.803 --> 03:07:36.113
LAURA: No, we don't. I don't think so because
we're not in the room anymore so we can try to see

03:07:36.113 --> 03:07:37.697
if the bowls do anything.

03:07:37.697 --> 03:07:39.472
LIAM: Do you think it would hurt if we did it at
the same time?

03:07:39.472 --> 03:07:40.966
SAM: Yeah, what's the problem with that?

03:07:40.966 --> 03:07:42.252
TRAVIS: Sure, try it. We'll see what happens.

03:07:42.252 --> 03:07:43.013
LIAM: Let's do it at the same time.

03:07:43.013 --> 03:07:45.061
SAM: At the count of <i>zwei</i>.

03:07:45.501 --> 03:07:47.252
MARISHA: Beau takes off her belt.

03:07:47.252 --> 03:07:50.450
LAURA: I'm going to cast my Spare the Dying
cantrip.

03:07:50.450 --> 03:07:51.225
MATT: Which is?

03:07:51.225 --> 03:07:51.961
LAURA: Necromancy.

03:07:51.961 --> 03:07:53.374
MATT: Necromancy. You're casting?

03:07:53.374 --> 03:07:54.231
SAM: Shocking Grasp.

03:07:54.231 --> 03:07:56.714
MATT: Okay. Which is evocation.

03:07:56.714 --> 03:07:58.769
LIAM: Identify, which is divination.

03:07:58.769 --> 03:08:04.387
MARISHA: I take off my belt, and I hold it up like
a rally car racer girl.

03:08:04.387 --> 03:08:08.925
(silence)

03:08:08.925 --> 03:08:09.677
TRAVIS: We're waiting.

03:08:09.677 --> 03:08:13.062
MARISHA: Three, two, one. (swishing)

03:08:13.062 --> 03:08:15.142
SAM: (gibberish)

03:08:15.142 --> 03:08:20.469
MATT: You guys all cast your spells. No effect on
the bowls.

03:08:20.469 --> 03:08:22.466
SAM: We have to be in the room!

03:08:22.466 --> 03:08:26.852
MATT: It's hard to see because there's still the
ash caked on the inside of it.

03:08:26.852 --> 03:08:31.710
LAURA: Wait. I blow on the bowl. Does it look like
any of the symbols got any brighter?

03:08:32.240 --> 03:08:35.562
TALIESIN: I would say the one that I had I
probably polished up.

03:08:35.562 --> 03:08:38.626
MATT: It's very hard to see with very little light
in here.

03:08:38.626 --> 03:08:43.192
LIAM: Okay. That was good. We checked that box, so
let's go back into the room.

03:08:43.192 --> 03:08:44.738
MATT: Make an intelligence check.

03:08:44.738 --> 03:08:45.338
LIAM: Yeah, okay.

03:08:45.338 --> 03:08:46.312
MARISHA: Come on.

03:08:47.272 --> 03:08:49.906
LIAM: Yeah, that's good. It's 20.

03:08:49.906 --> 03:09:01.537
MATT: 20? Very good. There is something bugging
you in the back of your head. Something that says

03:09:01.537 --> 03:09:09.926
the fact that these were urns that carried ash
speaks to the purpose of these. You can't make the

03:09:09.926 --> 03:09:16.031
connection here, but the fact that each of these
were filled with ash is bugging you. There's

03:09:16.031 --> 03:09:16.725
something there.

03:09:16.725 --> 03:09:19.932
LIAM: The urns, currently, are totally empty?

03:09:19.932 --> 03:09:21.110
MATT: They're totally empty, yes.

03:09:21.110 --> 03:09:22.645
SAM: Why don't we cast it on the rod?

03:09:22.645 --> 03:09:23.518
LIAM: I know. I--

03:09:25.238 --> 03:09:27.038
LAURA: Do we need to set these on fire?

03:09:27.038 --> 03:09:34.531
LIAM: We maybe need to go upstairs and scoop some
of the dustbuster bullshit into these and bring

03:09:34.531 --> 03:09:35.319
them down.

03:09:35.319 --> 03:09:38.276
TRAVIS: Nott, you want to go cast it on the rod?
Let's go. You and me, we'll do it.

03:09:38.716 --> 03:09:40.213
LAURA: You need three spells.

03:09:40.213 --> 03:09:45.322
LIAM: No, I'm saying we need to go collect some of
the ashes of the dead from upstairs.

03:09:45.322 --> 03:09:47.714
TRAVIS: Or maybe we need to set them on fire.

03:09:47.714 --> 03:09:49.347
LIAM: Something is missing here.

03:09:49.347 --> 03:09:51.042
LAURA: We need to set it on fire?

03:09:51.042 --> 03:09:53.067
ASHLEY: Wait, are they already filled with ash?
Right now?

03:09:53.067 --> 03:09:54.742
MATT: The ash has been mostly cleaned out.

03:09:54.742 --> 03:09:57.766
MARISHA: I still have this holy water, too.

03:09:57.766 --> 03:10:00.018
MATT: Yeah, you have your torch, and you have your
spells.

03:10:00.018 --> 03:10:02.101
LIAM: It's possible that we need to burn something
afresh.

03:10:02.101 --> 03:10:03.870
LAURA: Hold the torch under one of the bowls.

03:10:03.870 --> 03:10:07.894
LIAM: Yeah, I can set things on fire as well. Do
you want to do one?

03:10:07.894 --> 03:10:10.780
LAURA: Just hold it under and see what happens.

03:10:10.780 --> 03:10:14.417
LIAM: Yeah, it's easier. I cast Firebolt into one
of them.

03:10:14.417 --> 03:10:19.468
MATT: You cast Firebolt into one of them. The
flame bursts in there as you guys take the torch

03:10:19.468 --> 03:10:24.326
over to the side. As the fire subsides, you see
each of the symbols, portions of them are left

03:10:24.326 --> 03:10:28.572
glowing and slowly fade.

03:10:28.572 --> 03:10:30.514
MARISHA: Which ones? Which portions?

03:10:30.514 --> 03:10:34.726
MATT: All of them. All the symbols have certain
parts of them that just glow for a second in the

03:10:34.726 --> 03:10:36.696
presence of fire and then fade.

03:10:36.696 --> 03:10:41.469
LAURA: Hold the torch under one of them for a long
time and see what happens.

03:10:41.469 --> 03:10:42.722
MATT: Who's going to hold the bowl?

03:10:42.722 --> 03:10:45.546
TALIESIN: I'll hold the bowl. I'm resistant to
fire.

03:10:45.546 --> 03:10:48.623
MATT: You take the bowl, and you hold it out
there. It hurts a little but as you hold the torch

03:10:48.623 --> 03:10:53.451
underneath, it begins to light up. You watch as
the symbols begin to glow on the inside of these

03:10:53.451 --> 03:10:54.954
metal inscribed bits.

03:10:54.954 --> 03:10:56.268
TALIESIN: Look at this.

03:10:56.268 --> 03:10:58.106
LAURA: Woah! Here we go.

03:10:58.106 --> 03:10:58.768
SAM: So creepy.

03:10:58.768 --> 03:11:01.538
TALIESIN: There we are.

03:11:01.538 --> 03:11:02.275
MARISHA: Yes!

03:11:02.275 --> 03:11:08.199
SAM: What? Parts of the symbols are glowing more.

03:11:08.199 --> 03:11:10.451
LAURA: We were wrong about what we needed to
cast.

03:11:10.451 --> 03:11:16.995
LIAM: Just to note, Schmidt is still here with us.
If we need anyone to hold anything that's dangerous--

03:11:17.422 --> 03:11:18.474
LAURA: That's that one.

03:11:18.474 --> 03:11:21.791
TALIESIN: We need-- transmutation--

03:11:21.791 --> 03:11:23.011
LAURA: What is this?

03:11:23.011 --> 03:11:23.596
TALIESIN: That's--

03:11:23.596 --> 03:11:25.979
LAURA: Illusion! We need an illusion.

03:11:25.979 --> 03:11:27.270
SAM: I know those!

03:11:27.270 --> 03:11:29.156
TALIESIN: And we need enchantment.

03:11:29.156 --> 03:11:31.052
LAURA: Transmutation--

03:11:31.052 --> 03:11:33.251
TALIESIN: Illusion and enchantment.

03:11:33.251 --> 03:11:34.933
MARISHA: And enchantment.

03:11:34.933 --> 03:11:36.650
LAURA: I have an enchantment.

03:11:36.650 --> 03:11:38.222
LIAM: I have transmutation.

03:11:38.222 --> 03:11:42.452
TRAVIS: There's fine writing around the square.
That's not just a shape. See this writing in here?

03:11:42.452 --> 03:11:46.511
SAM: I know an enchantment spell and an illusion
spell.

03:11:46.511 --> 03:11:48.526
LIAM: I know enchantment and transmutation.

03:11:48.526 --> 03:11:53.198
SAM: Why don't you do trans? I'll do enchant.

03:11:57.258 --> 03:11:59.414
LAURA: I can transmute or something.

03:11:59.414 --> 03:12:00.490
SAM: Oh, you can?

03:12:00.490 --> 03:12:01.717
LAURA: I think so.

03:12:01.717 --> 03:12:03.660
LIAM: All right. We'll figure out--

03:12:03.660 --> 03:12:05.322
TALIESIN: I don't think it turns.

03:12:05.322 --> 03:12:07.467
SAM: I'm so glad you taught me magic, Caleb.

03:12:07.467 --> 03:12:09.692
TALIESIN: I've got an idea. I think I know how it
works now.

03:12:09.692 --> 03:12:13.865
SAM: I don't know how it works, and I'm not paying
any attention. I'm very drunk.

03:12:13.865 --> 03:12:21.088
TALIESIN: This is great. I think that this is a
guide. We know what we need to know because of

03:12:21.088 --> 03:12:26.838
these bowls. I think we need all three of these
versions of the spells placed in each of these points.

03:12:27.098 --> 03:12:30.535
MARISHA: We put bowls-- no.

03:12:30.882 --> 03:12:33.107
LAURA: We don't even need the bowls.

03:12:33.107 --> 03:12:36.543
SAM: One, two three, right there! That's where we
need to spin it over there!

03:12:36.543 --> 03:12:38.694
TALIESIN: Everybody stand at their point.

03:12:38.694 --> 03:12:42.972
LAURA: Wait. I got to find my spell that actually
does the thing that I said I could do.

03:12:42.972 --> 03:12:48.626
SAM: Oh! Right there! See? That symbol matches
with this one.

03:12:48.626 --> 03:12:50.961
TALIESIN: (sarcastically) Are you sure?

03:12:50.961 --> 03:12:53.256
SAM: I figured this out, guys!

03:12:53.256 --> 03:12:59.891
(laughter)

03:12:59.891 --> 03:13:01.528
LAURA: Wait, I have enchantment.

03:13:01.528 --> 03:13:03.403
SAM: So what do you have?

03:13:03.403 --> 03:13:05.050
LAURA: Enchantment.

03:13:05.050 --> 03:13:08.366
TALIESIN: We need transmutation and illusion.

03:13:08.366 --> 03:13:11.547
LIAM: I have transmutation and enchantment.

03:13:11.547 --> 03:13:14.524
SAM: I have illusion and transmutation.

03:13:14.524 --> 03:13:17.014
LIAM: And what do you have, Jester?

03:13:17.014 --> 03:13:18.722
LAURA: I have enchantment.

03:13:18.722 --> 03:13:22.971
LIAM: So you're enchantment. That means I have
transmutation.

03:13:22.971 --> 03:13:24.199
SAM: I'm illusion.

03:13:24.740 --> 03:13:26.730
MARISHA: All right, yes!

03:13:26.730 --> 03:13:29.248
TALIESIN: If anything starts to happen, I want you
to run for the door.

03:13:29.248 --> 03:13:35.875
LAURA: Okay. I'll go stand by the enchantment--
under the symbol for enchantment, just in case.

03:13:38.225 --> 03:13:40.141
TALIESIN: That would be the three dots.

03:13:42.491 --> 03:13:48.210
SAM: What about you Fjord? Don't you have some
spells on you? Why aren't you helping out?

03:13:48.210 --> 03:13:49.530
TRAVIS: What do you want?

03:13:49.530 --> 03:13:51.272
LAURA: Can you do enchantment?

03:13:51.272 --> 03:13:55.685
TRAVIS: Nope. I got evocation. I got necrotic.

03:13:55.685 --> 03:13:57.998
LIAM: If another cube or something comes out--

03:13:57.998 --> 03:13:59.164
TALIESIN: We need fighters.

03:14:00.224 --> 03:14:03.613
MARISHA: Me and Fjord will stand by in case
anything else drops out of the ceiling.

03:14:03.613 --> 03:14:07.447
LIAM: That's right. We've got these two bruisers
here. That's good. I concur.

03:14:09.497 --> 03:14:11.682
TALIESIN: Just in case, I'm going to light my
other sword too.

03:14:11.682 --> 03:14:13.679
MATT: (flames) Mark your damage on that.

03:14:13.679 --> 03:14:15.845
SAM: Where are we casting it upon?

03:14:15.845 --> 03:14:18.229
LAURA: I think we're casting it at the staff.

03:14:21.479 --> 03:14:22.479
SAM: All right.

03:14:22.479 --> 03:14:27.138
MARISHA: Yasha, you want to take another point?
Fighters and casters?

03:14:27.138 --> 03:14:27.807
ASHLEY: Yep.

03:14:29.237 --> 03:14:32.980
TRAVIS: Oh my god. I'm going to cast Armor of
Agathys on myself again.

03:14:33.584 --> 03:14:38.262
LAURA: Do we need to be standing in front of the
symbol that it lines up with?

03:14:38.262 --> 03:14:42.452
TALIESIN: I would stand in front of the symbols on
the triangle, personally.

03:14:42.452 --> 03:14:45.312
LAURA: I'll go stand in front of the three dots.

03:14:45.312 --> 03:14:50.670
MARISHA: This was a research facility for mages.
They're super uppity about this shit, yeah.

03:14:50.670 --> 03:14:54.110
SAM: I go over next to the illusion one.

03:14:55.500 --> 03:14:57.670
LIAM: I, of course, in front of transmutation.

03:14:58.510 --> 03:15:03.503
MATT: As you guys are triangulated around those
specific coordinates you've set yourselves, what

03:15:03.503 --> 03:15:04.545
do you do?

03:15:04.545 --> 03:15:06.394
LAURA: We count to three and we go?

03:15:06.394 --> 03:15:10.172
LIAM: You're doing what? I'm doing Maximilian's
Earthen Grasp again with my cat's paw.

03:15:10.172 --> 03:15:11.504
LAURA: I'm doing Hold Person.

03:15:11.504 --> 03:15:17.355
SAM: I'm taking a bit of fleece and doing some
hand symbols and casting Silent Image.

03:15:17.355 --> 03:15:19.741
MATT: All right. You're casting--?

03:15:19.741 --> 03:15:21.102
LAURA: Hold Person.

03:15:21.102 --> 03:15:23.054
MARISHA: I pull off the belt again.

03:15:25.294 --> 03:15:26.216
ASHLEY: Sword at the ready.

03:15:30.466 --> 03:15:34.028
MARISHA: One, two, three!

03:15:36.498 --> 03:15:42.545
MATT: As the three of you complete your
incantations, the energy unleashed from the arcane

03:15:42.545 --> 03:15:49.799
and divine schools of magic, you watch as the
energy disperses from the spell, and all three go

03:15:49.799 --> 03:15:56.039
(sucking sound) right into the center rod. It sits
there shimmering from the impact. You guys back

03:15:56.039 --> 03:16:04.894
away, and it slowly goes cold again. On the
opposite side of the chamber, you hear (grinding),

03:16:04.894 --> 03:16:11.121
and you watch as a false wall on the opposite end
rotates open, leading you to a hallway on the

03:16:11.121 --> 03:16:12.919
opposite side that was previously closed.

03:16:12.919 --> 03:16:14.563
(cheering)

03:16:14.563 --> 03:16:15.661
MATT: Well done, guys!

03:16:17.691 --> 03:16:18.701
LAURA: Oh man!

03:16:20.461 --> 03:16:22.420
TRAVIS: I cast Armor of Agathys for nothing.

03:16:22.420 --> 03:16:24.381
MATT: You still got it for an hour.

03:16:24.381 --> 03:16:30.185
LAURA: That's good, because who knows what else
we'll run into while we're down here.

03:16:30.185 --> 03:16:31.463
MARISHA: On the other side.

03:16:31.463 --> 03:16:33.880
TRAVIS: Well, I'm wearing it. I'll run over to the
door.

03:16:33.880 --> 03:16:35.356
TALIESIN: Check for traps.

03:16:35.356 --> 03:16:42.166
LIAM: Wait! I sit down, and I start doing the
ritual for Detect Magic again. Ten minutes.

03:16:42.166 --> 03:16:44.998
MATT: While he's doing that, anybody else doing
anything?

03:16:45.001 --> 03:16:49.394
TRAVIS: I'm running over to the door. I'm not
crossing the threshold. I just want to see. I got darkvision.

03:16:49.394 --> 03:16:52.586
MATT: Looking inside, with what low light is
coming through from the edges of Yasha's

03:16:52.785 --> 03:16:59.287
torchlight, the first thing that hits you is the
smell. It's a strange combination of old decay,

03:16:59.287 --> 03:17:05.838
strong rust, and burnt hair. It's hard to
describe, but it's a very unpleasant mingling of

03:17:05.838 --> 03:17:14.643
smells as it hits you. Looking inside, you see a
chamber ahead divided into three smaller sections

03:17:14.643 --> 03:17:20.365
and a center main chamber area. The center main
chamber area is what you can most make out the

03:17:20.365 --> 03:17:26.079
details of. It looks like some sort of inert
arcane circle in the center. There's a symbol

03:17:26.079 --> 03:17:33.559
drawn there with runes around, but it's currently
cold and dark. You can't see much further beyond

03:17:33.559 --> 03:17:37.370
that because you're staying at the doorway, and to
the right and left it looks there's two smaller

03:17:37.370 --> 03:17:40.431
chambers immediately, and then it goes further
in.

03:17:40.431 --> 03:17:45.831
TRAVIS: We got more magic stuff inside. I know
Caleb's meditating, but it's going to get hairy, I

03:17:45.831 --> 03:17:48.487
bet. Smells a little burnt hair-y.

03:17:48.487 --> 03:17:50.525
ASHLEY: I walk up behind Fjord.

03:17:51.505 --> 03:17:56.356
MATT: The torchlight extends into the chamber, and
you can see a little more now. The two side

03:17:56.356 --> 03:18:02.352
chambers are almost pill-shaped. They're rounded
at each side, and they're enclosed, but open into

03:18:02.352 --> 03:18:07.666
the center chamber. At each of these rounded
edges, as you step inside and glance to the right

03:18:07.666 --> 03:18:16.707
and left, you can see cage-like contraptions: iron
domes that are very tight-knit, dark iron rusted

03:18:16.707 --> 03:18:23.337
metal. They're on the edges of each side. You see
load-bearing pillars in the center of the chamber

03:18:23.337 --> 03:18:30.686
to the right and left, and cold braziers behind
those against the walls: little domed pieces of

03:18:30.686 --> 03:18:38.326
stone that once contained flame for light. Across
the way you can see two tables with chairs, a

03:18:38.326 --> 03:18:42.297
bookcase. That's all you can see at this
distance.

03:18:42.297 --> 03:18:45.240
TRAVIS: The dome cages are solid steel, or are
they bars?

03:18:45.240 --> 03:18:51.976
MATT: They're bars, but the bars are an inch, inch
and a half between each. It's very little space in between.

03:18:52.205 --> 03:18:56.718
TALIESIN: I'm going to start heading in this
direction, too. Does one of them look like it was

03:18:56.718 --> 03:18:59.628
possibly holding a gelatinous cube at some point?

03:18:59.628 --> 03:19:02.010
MATT: Are you entering the chamber to look?

03:19:02.010 --> 03:19:03.809
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll go with you.

03:19:03.809 --> 03:19:05.185
LAURA: You should detect traps.

03:19:05.185 --> 03:19:08.402
SAM: All right, I'll look for traps. I know it's
my job.

03:19:08.402 --> 03:19:10.475
MATT: Go ahead and make an investigation check.

03:19:10.475 --> 03:19:11.956
LIAM: Five more minutes!

03:19:11.956 --> 03:19:12.611
SAM: 13.

03:19:12.611 --> 03:19:16.305
MATT: Best you can tell, there's no traps in this
first portion of the chamber.

03:19:16.305 --> 03:19:20.210
SAM: All clear. I take another swig from my
flask.

03:19:20.210 --> 03:19:22.678
MATT: Okay. How drunk are you right now?

03:19:22.678 --> 03:19:23.820
SAM: Pretty drunk.

03:19:23.820 --> 03:19:25.823
MATT: We'll put you in the drunk status, then.

03:19:25.823 --> 03:19:31.089
SAM: It's been a long night.

03:19:31.089 --> 03:19:33.097
TRAVIS: Yasha, Molly, want to come in?

03:19:33.097 --> 03:19:40.376
SAM: By the way, Yasha, can I say, you weren't
even with us yesterday, and now you're down here

03:19:40.376 --> 03:19:46.478
doing this! Is this crazy? What were you doing
yesterday?

03:19:46.478 --> 03:19:53.910
ASHLEY: I was sitting in the tavern and then you
guys came into the tavern.

03:19:53.910 --> 03:19:57.381
SAM: But did you know that you'd be down here with
us tonight?

03:19:57.381 --> 03:19:58.998
ASHLEY: Yes, Nott, I did.

03:19:58.998 --> 03:20:01.126
SAM: How did you know that?

03:20:01.126 --> 03:20:08.291
ASHLEY: I happen to-- no, Nott, I did not know.

03:20:08.291 --> 03:20:10.720
SAM: How and when will I die?

03:20:10.720 --> 03:20:12.817
ASHLEY: I can't tell you that, Nott.

03:20:12.817 --> 03:20:14.511
SAM: But you know!

03:20:14.511 --> 03:20:16.041
ASHLEY: Yes, of course.

03:20:18.681 --> 03:20:19.927
TRAVIS: She's powerful.

03:20:22.227 --> 03:20:25.008
TALIESIN: Don't spoil it for her. We'll find out
in an hour or so anyway.

03:20:25.008 --> 03:20:26.743
ASHLEY: Okay. Good call, Molly.

03:20:27.503 --> 03:20:31.358
MATT: Yasha, you enter with the torch as well? All
right, the three of them enter. You guys following

03:20:31.358 --> 03:20:32.827
behind or are you staying back with Caleb?

03:20:32.827 --> 03:20:37.432
LIAM: Caleb is super intense on his shit right
now, going: I am helping the group. Everyone's

03:20:37.432 --> 03:20:38.683
going to be safe.

03:20:38.683 --> 03:20:42.513
MARISHA: Beau's left behind going: Come on! Pick
it up, Caleb!

03:20:43.723 --> 03:20:46.610
LAURA: Beau, should I use my last spell to heal
myself?

03:20:46.610 --> 03:20:48.762
SAM: I have a healing potion.

03:20:48.762 --> 03:20:52.803
MARISHA: Jester, you should always look out for
yourself first, all right?

03:20:53.483 --> 03:20:55.608
TRAVIS: I have a healing potion if you want one,
too.

03:20:55.608 --> 03:20:58.259
LAURA: So I should cast the spell on myself?

03:20:58.259 --> 03:21:00.939
MARISHA: I am waiting behind, motherfucker!

03:21:01.299 --> 03:21:03.534
TRAVIS: I take a healing potion, and I hand it to
Jester.

03:21:05.274 --> 03:21:10.862
LAURA: This seems like a waste of money. I'm
trying to be smarter with my money.

03:21:10.862 --> 03:21:13.205
SAM: No, you're the worst with money.

03:21:13.765 --> 03:21:16.795
MATT: Regular healing potion? 2d4 plus two.

03:21:19.485 --> 03:21:20.081
TRAVIS: Seven.

03:21:21.721 --> 03:21:24.025
TALIESIN: Yay, double digits.

03:21:24.025 --> 03:21:30.110
MATT: It's better than half. As you guys begin to
enter the chamber, you are now stepping into the

03:21:30.404 --> 03:21:34.790
center of this inert magical circle, with the two
cold braziers and the pillars. You see the four

03:21:34.790 --> 03:21:40.107
cages on the two opposite ends of the rounded,
pill-shaped side rooms, and across the way there

03:21:40.107 --> 03:21:47.561
is the bookcase and the two tables. As you get
closer and see, there's two non-lit candelabra.

03:21:47.561 --> 03:21:52.142
What faint bits of candle remnants are there are
mostly melted, and the wax dripping off and

03:21:52.142 --> 03:21:55.565
causing small pools in the ground, but they've
been cold for some time.

03:21:55.565 --> 03:21:57.102
TRAVIS: I go over to one of the cages.

03:21:57.102 --> 03:21:59.503
LIAM: Did we wait the short amount of time for
Detect Magic?

03:21:59.503 --> 03:22:04.561
MARISHA: I am in-between you and them, and I'm
going: come on, come on.

03:22:04.561 --> 03:22:07.111
TRAVIS: I go over to one of the cages, the
nearest left one.

03:22:07.111 --> 03:22:08.464
MATT: Perception check.

03:22:11.714 --> 03:22:12.648
TRAVIS: 14.

03:22:12.648 --> 03:22:17.236
MATT: You glance through with the light that's
flickering through the various gaps in this iron

03:22:17.236 --> 03:22:28.133
cage, and inside you can see a similar clay urn,
deep red, sitting in the center. You see burnt and

03:22:28.133 --> 03:22:30.520
tattered clothing at the sides of it.

03:22:30.520 --> 03:22:34.539
TRAVIS: Oh jeez. Got another urn here full of
ash.

03:22:34.539 --> 03:22:35.914
LAURA: Be careful!

03:22:35.914 --> 03:22:37.804
SAM: Kill it! Break it!

03:22:37.804 --> 03:22:41.083
TRAVIS: Anyone want to check the other cages? Make
sure it's not the same thing in each?

03:22:41.083 --> 03:22:42.561
TALIESIN: I'll go take a look at the other cage.

03:22:42.561 --> 03:22:44.136
ASHLEY: I'll go look at another one.

03:22:44.136 --> 03:22:45.502
MATT: You glance-- make a perception check.

03:22:45.502 --> 03:22:47.113
LAURA: I'm hanging out with Caleb and Beau.

03:22:47.723 --> 03:22:52.873
MATT: You finish your ability. Your Detect Magic
is now in effect.

03:22:52.873 --> 03:22:53.506
TALIESIN: 19.

03:22:55.466 --> 03:22:58.552
MATT: Glancing into one of the far end cages--
What did you get, Yasha?

03:22:58.552 --> 03:23:00.663
ASHLEY: I got 17.

03:23:01.473 --> 03:23:06.477
MATT: You guys hit two other cages on the right
side, both the far end close edge of that

03:23:06.477 --> 03:23:11.916
platform. You're looking in the small cages. You
see another urn, and you glance up and see at the

03:23:11.916 --> 03:23:18.031
very top, there's a chain of some kind that was
wrapped in a noose. You see the urn that contains

03:23:18.031 --> 03:23:26.168
the ash down within, there are remnants of ash
around the outside in a circle, and bits of cloth

03:23:26.168 --> 03:23:31.451
and material, and this chain noose hanging above
where this urn was.

03:23:31.451 --> 03:23:34.768
TALIESIN: Would I be insane for thinking this is
how they make them?

03:23:35.228 --> 03:23:36.070
SAM: Make what?

03:23:36.490 --> 03:23:38.079
LAURA: The will-o'-wisps.

03:23:41.269 --> 03:23:44.006
LIAM: The will-o'-wisps are the dead. They are
left from the dead.

03:23:46.486 --> 03:23:49.330
TALIESIN: This was a factory, maybe?

03:23:50.280 --> 03:23:53.940
TRAVIS: Heading over to Molly, I stop in the
middle of the room at that inert circle. Does it

03:23:53.940 --> 03:23:55.390
look like anything?

03:23:55.390 --> 03:23:56.547
MATT: Make an arcana check.

03:23:56.547 --> 03:23:58.511
ASHLEY: Are we near the table at all?

03:24:00.981 --> 03:24:01.742
TRAVIS: 21.

03:24:02.752 --> 03:24:06.211
MATT: You guys can move to the opposite end if you
want to get closer to the table. Looking at the

03:24:06.211 --> 03:24:17.577
inert circle, it looks like-- You have an
instinctual arcane knowledge that's been imparted

03:24:17.577 --> 03:24:21.732
upon you by whatever this gift has been given to
you, so the knowledge comes to you. It's alien but

03:24:21.732 --> 03:24:28.877
familiar at the same time, and your brain's trying
to work through this disconnect. This circle looks

03:24:28.877 --> 03:24:39.631
like it was once developed to be a teleportation
circle, but has since, it seems, been scarred and closed.

03:24:42.510 --> 03:24:52.010
TRAVIS: I feel like this was used to move or
deliver people or things. This was a center for transportation.

03:24:52.601 --> 03:24:55.238
SAM: What the fuck are you talking about?

03:24:55.238 --> 03:24:59.693
(laughter)

03:24:59.693 --> 03:25:01.970
LAURA: Are we in the other room still, or did we
come in?

03:25:01.970 --> 03:25:05.251
MATT: Caleb has now finished and you guys can
enter the chamber.

03:25:05.251 --> 03:25:06.105
TRAVIS: Real bright.

03:25:06.105 --> 03:25:15.375
(laughter)

03:25:15.375 --> 03:25:16.576
SAM: Sounds good, Fjord.

03:25:16.576 --> 03:25:22.097
ASHLEY: How close to the table can we get?

03:25:22.097 --> 03:25:27.680
MATT: How close do you want to get? There's two
tables, both kitty-corner into the further chamber.

03:25:27.962 --> 03:25:29.865
TALIESIN: I want to wait for Caleb at this point.

03:25:29.865 --> 03:25:31.284
LAURA: Can I look around the room?

03:25:31.284 --> 03:25:32.386
SAM: Do you need my help?

03:25:32.386 --> 03:25:33.413
TRAVIS: Is he done yet?

03:25:33.413 --> 03:25:36.261
LIAM: Give me a second to blacklight the room.

03:25:36.261 --> 03:25:45.774
MARISHA: Caleb, I love you, but we are missing out
on other shit. I'm having extreme FOMO right now.

03:25:45.774 --> 03:25:47.062
<i>Come on.</i>

03:25:47.062 --> 03:25:48.542
LAURA: We're in the room. Let's go.

03:25:48.542 --> 03:25:50.448
LIAM: Yeah, I'm waiting for the narrator to--

03:25:50.448 --> 03:25:52.968
MATT: Yeah, I told you, a couple times. You
finished your spell.

03:25:52.968 --> 03:25:58.872
LIAM: Yes, good, right. So I'm walking. Is there
anyone between the bookshelf and me, where I am?

03:25:58.872 --> 03:25:59.553
Is Fjord?

03:25:59.553 --> 03:26:02.761
MATT: Yes, currently it looks like Jester and
Yasha are in between that space.

03:26:02.761 --> 03:26:03.971
LIAM: Who's the closest?

03:26:03.971 --> 03:26:05.557
MATT: They're both equidistant.

03:26:05.557 --> 03:26:11.651
LIAM: I walk up between the two of them, and I
have a 30 foot radius on the spell, so I'm

03:26:11.651 --> 03:26:17.537
basically doing this, but I'm very interested in
the bookshelf obviously. I'm looking everywhere.

03:26:17.537 --> 03:26:23.035
MATT: There's a <i>very</i> faint magical aura from the
symbol in the center, but it seems largely clouded

03:26:23.035 --> 03:26:32.112
and marked off. It's like somebody had taped over
a blacklit drawing. It's been marred and prevented

03:26:32.112 --> 03:26:34.690
from use, from what it seems at the moment.

03:26:34.690 --> 03:26:37.342
LIAM: Is there a type? I will ask that every
time.

03:26:37.342 --> 03:26:40.633
MATT: Yes, there is. And just to be consistent,
here.

03:26:42.483 --> 03:26:44.377
LIAM: Friendship magic.

03:26:44.377 --> 03:27:02.458
MATT: It is conjuration. There is a very faint
magical essence, straight ahead. As you focus and

03:27:02.783 --> 03:27:07.492
lean forward, it becomes a little stronger. Above
the bookshelf, there is a shape, embedded in the

03:27:07.492 --> 03:27:11.117
wall, that is emitting a slight magical aura.

03:27:12.237 --> 03:27:13.724
LIAM: In the wall, above the bookshelf?

03:27:13.724 --> 03:27:18.239
MATT: Above the bookshelf, you don't have quite
enough light, and Yasha's holding the torch that's

03:27:18.239 --> 03:27:19.868
being cut off from the roof.

03:27:19.868 --> 03:27:24.803
TALIESIN: I've got a light stone in my pocket if
anyone wants to go for it. Here, hold on--

03:27:25.683 --> 03:27:26.941
SAM: A <i>light</i> stone?

03:27:26.941 --> 03:27:28.621
LAURA: Ooh, I'll climb up on the bookshelf.

03:27:28.621 --> 03:27:29.178
TALIESIN: Careful!

03:27:29.178 --> 03:27:34.444
MATT: As you approach, the bookshelf is mostly
empty. Similar to the first chamber you went to,

03:27:34.444 --> 03:27:44.978
it looks like either everything in here was taken
or destroyed. Most of the bookshelf is plain empty

03:27:44.978 --> 03:27:51.080
with broken pieces, and tattered bits of paper,
and no books present on the shelf at the moment.

03:27:51.080 --> 03:27:51.935
LIAM: Zero books.

03:27:51.935 --> 03:27:57.023
MATT: That you see on the shelf as you close in to
look at it. As you climb the shelf and look up,

03:27:57.023 --> 03:28:06.390
above the bookshelf there is, placed ornamentally
on the wall, a very wide blade, longsword of some

03:28:06.390 --> 03:28:08.975
kind is bolted onto the wall as an ornamental
display.

03:28:08.975 --> 03:28:13.934
LAURA: Does it look trapped? Is this trapped on
the wall?

03:28:13.934 --> 03:28:14.964
SAM: You want me to check it?

03:28:14.964 --> 03:28:16.481
LAURA: Climb up on the bookshelf with me!

03:28:16.481 --> 03:28:17.394
TRAVIS: Please pull it out.

03:28:17.394 --> 03:28:18.188
TALIESIN: This can't go wrong.

03:28:18.188 --> 03:28:26.640
SAM: I go up and check. I got a-- oh wait,
disadvantage, I'm drunk. That's a 19.

03:28:26.640 --> 03:28:29.441
MATT: 19. Best you can tell, there's no trap.

03:28:29.441 --> 03:28:31.290
LAURA: Should I try to pull it out?

03:28:31.290 --> 03:28:33.816
TRAVIS: Yeah, pull it off. I'll give you all my
health potions in one day.

03:28:33.816 --> 03:28:36.533
LAURA: I lift, I pull, and I try to pull it off
the wall.

03:28:36.533 --> 03:28:42.402
MATT: Okay. It takes you a moment, because it's
bolted in. The blade comes free, and you pull back

03:28:42.402 --> 03:28:48.860
on it you begin to, "Whoa!" off the side. You guys
catch Jester. She plummets off of the bookshelf.

03:28:48.860 --> 03:28:51.964
You manage to trust fall her, if you will, as she
falls from the top.

03:28:51.964 --> 03:28:56.413
LAURA: Good job not getting stabbed, you guys,
because this is sharp-looking.

03:28:56.413 --> 03:29:03.419
MATT: It is a heavy-looking blade. The hilt of it
is gold and curls up to the side. It is all these

03:29:03.419 --> 03:29:10.280
tiny runes inscribed along the edge. The central
blade is <i>thick</i>. It's about that wide at the side

03:29:10.575 --> 03:29:19.223
and slowly tapers to the edge. None of you come
from a specific blacksmith background, so you

03:29:19.223 --> 03:29:21.833
wouldn't know the purpose of the blade, but it
looks dangerous.

03:29:22.713 --> 03:29:25.268
LAURA: This is a sacrificial blade for sure.

03:29:25.268 --> 03:29:26.404
TRAVIS: Is it long?

03:29:26.404 --> 03:29:28.660
MATT: Yeah, it's about six feet long.

03:29:30.500 --> 03:29:31.673
LIAM: Jester's holding it?

03:29:31.673 --> 03:29:33.196
LAURA: I'm holding it.

03:29:33.196 --> 03:29:34.096
LIAM: How's the girth?

03:29:34.096 --> 03:29:40.752
LAURA: It's pretty girthy. Can you identify it?

03:29:43.752 --> 03:29:50.828
LIAM: I obviously can do that, and I have a little
bit of reserve left, but we are still not topside

03:29:50.828 --> 03:29:55.618
yet, so we can either sit for ten minutes and I
can tell you exactly what it does, or we wait

03:29:55.618 --> 03:29:58.391
until later. But I'm not willing to do this--

03:29:58.391 --> 03:30:00.178
MARISHA: No more ten minutes.

03:30:00.178 --> 03:30:01.433
LIAM: It is ten minutes.

03:30:01.433 --> 03:30:02.728
LAURA: I'll strap it to my back.

03:30:02.728 --> 03:30:04.161
LIAM: We can wait until later.

03:30:04.161 --> 03:30:05.504
TALIESIN: Put it in the bag.

03:30:05.504 --> 03:30:11.261
LAURA: It's very sharp and the bag is easily
punctured and I don't want to risk it. I'll strap

03:30:11.261 --> 03:30:12.562
it to my back.

03:30:12.562 --> 03:30:16.340
TRAVIS: Shouldn't we, for good measure, be
breaking up these other ceramic--?

03:30:16.340 --> 03:30:18.732
TALIESIN: Are those ceramic pots giving anything
off?

03:30:18.732 --> 03:30:24.723
MATT: The tables, by the way, that are right next
to the bookshelf, have writing utensils, quills on

03:30:24.723 --> 03:30:28.523
the side, one has an inkwell that has been long
dried over that has a spider web attached to it.

03:30:29.323 --> 03:30:30.295
LIAM: Does it have any paper?

03:30:30.967 --> 03:30:32.470
MATT: Make an investigation check.

03:30:33.480 --> 03:30:34.371
LIAM: A natural 20.

03:30:34.371 --> 03:30:35.569
LAURA: Ooh!

03:30:36.572 --> 03:30:42.106
MATT: You don't notice any paper, but as you
glance underneath one of the tables, on the bottom

03:30:42.106 --> 03:30:50.287
it looks like one book has been not taken, or at
least had fallen beneath and was left behind.

03:30:50.717 --> 03:30:52.063
SAM: Liam just got an erection.

03:30:52.063 --> 03:30:56.288
MATT: I heard it! It was like (deep thud) on the
table.

03:30:57.248 --> 03:30:58.861
TRAVIS: Oh come on, it's like (light thud).

03:31:00.681 --> 03:31:02.218
LIAM: No, the first one was right.

03:31:05.478 --> 03:31:10.099
MATT: The book, as you pull it out, a corner of it
is burned pretty heavily.

03:31:11.209 --> 03:31:12.784
LIAM: Detect Magic's still going, by the way.

03:31:12.784 --> 03:31:19.195
MATT: Correct. There's no magical source from it.
Where you found it, there's a bit of an ash trail

03:31:19.195 --> 03:31:24.627
that leads back towards the far wall, towards
where one of the braziers is. You get the sense

03:31:24.627 --> 03:31:29.926
that maybe whatever was in here may have been
thrown in the braziers to burn and this book got

03:31:29.926 --> 03:31:36.109
discarded or thrown. You open and start looking
through the pages. What languages do you know?

03:31:37.489 --> 03:31:45.510
LIAM: I know Common! Oh god. I don't know where to
look on D&amp;D Beyond.

03:31:45.510 --> 03:31:46.766
SAM: Proficiencies.

03:31:47.496 --> 03:31:49.133
MATT: It would be under proficiencies, probably.

03:31:49.133 --> 03:31:49.885
SAM: No, it's not there.

03:31:49.885 --> 03:31:50.615
MATT: Oh, it's not? Okay.

03:31:50.615 --> 03:31:52.079
SAM: Come on, D&amp;D Beyond!

03:31:52.079 --> 03:31:54.074
TALIESIN: Character details, under description.

03:31:54.074 --> 03:31:58.918
LIAM: Description, character details? I know
Sylvan, Common, and Celestial.

03:31:58.918 --> 03:32:01.466
MATT: You do not recognize this script.

03:32:01.466 --> 03:32:04.548
LIAM: Then I will cast Comprehend Languages.

03:32:05.708 --> 03:32:08.530
SAM: I hope that doesn't get rid of all your other
spells.

03:32:09.470 --> 03:32:13.990
LIAM: It doesn't. Just one. I cast Comprehend
Languages.

03:32:13.990 --> 03:32:20.241
MATT: As you finish casting the spell, Caleb's
hand incantation completes, the eyes light up with

03:32:20.328 --> 03:32:25.020
a strange yellowish energy. All the words on the
page that previously made no sense suddenly shift,

03:32:25.020 --> 03:32:29.929
go out of focus, and come back into focus in a
language that you can understand. It is Draconic.

03:32:29.929 --> 03:32:41.539
Reading through briefly, and it is scribblings,
disjointed and broken in place. Taking a moment to

03:32:41.539 --> 03:32:47.566
look through, you get the sense this is the
journal of somebody named Siff Duthar.

03:32:48.486 --> 03:32:49.308
LIAM: Don't write that down!

03:32:50.198 --> 03:32:50.831
LAURA: Why?

03:32:51.821 --> 03:32:52.809
LIAM: Because only <i>I</i> know it!

03:32:52.809 --> 03:32:54.366
MARISHA: I'm definitely going to write it down.

03:32:54.366 --> 03:32:56.001
SAM: Siff Duthar!

03:32:56.001 --> 03:33:00.237
MATT: Siff. S-I-F-F. Duthar.

03:33:00.237 --> 03:33:02.109
LAURA: The thing is, he probably won't ever tell
us.

03:33:02.489 --> 03:33:03.863
SAM: He'll tell me!

03:33:04.743 --> 03:33:12.028
MATT: The pages, the ramblings speak of a coming
war. They talk about foolish pawns who follow

03:33:12.028 --> 03:33:18.870
their gods to annihilation. They speak of the
armies of Ghor Dranas washing over the land and

03:33:18.870 --> 03:33:26.271
pauper and kings alike being saved not at all and
being placed on a pike and held like a banner into

03:33:26.271 --> 03:33:32.650
battle regardless of who they are. They speak of
the weakness of flesh and the need to endure

03:33:32.650 --> 03:33:40.215
beyond the paltry life shell that we're given. It
talks about experiments with refugees, finding if

03:33:40.215 --> 03:33:48.317
the soul is bound to the flesh in any form, be it
ice or ash. It speaks of an obsession with

03:33:48.317 --> 03:33:55.414
avoiding the eternal hunger of The Crawling King,
he who tunnels beneath the world and will find him.

03:33:55.414 --> 03:34:00.149
SAM: Oh boy. This seems like beyond our level
stuff.

03:34:00.149 --> 03:34:01.905
TALIESIN: Is there an audiobook version of this?

03:34:03.475 --> 03:34:10.007
MATT: It speaks of a bounty hunter, who had
infiltrated this sanctum after Siff. And while it

03:34:10.007 --> 03:34:18.567
cost Siff his legs, the hunter was burned into the
brazier, flames of erasure. A trophy shall be

03:34:18.567 --> 03:34:20.493
taken and displayed as a warning.

03:34:20.493 --> 03:34:24.789
MARISHA: It's the sword! It's the fucking sword!

03:34:24.789 --> 03:34:29.189
MATT: From there, it grows more and more manic.
The scrawlings taking you a moment, even with the

03:34:29.722 --> 03:34:35.233
spell, to focus and make it out. Speaking on
quaking within the earth around that shakes the

03:34:35.233 --> 03:34:43.553
surrounding hills and darken the sky. The betrayer
gods come. The power of man must remain. The

03:34:43.553 --> 03:34:52.185
arcane gifts must bypass their punishment, show
them that they are not above their creations. The

03:34:52.185 --> 03:34:57.291
final notes grow even more paranoid, worried that
the secrets that Siff seeks will fall into the

03:34:57.291 --> 03:35:03.277
hands of Ghor Dranas and that all must be
destroyed. All must come to ash and from the

03:35:03.277 --> 03:35:09.229
ashes, shall rise again. That's the final page
before the rest of the book is charred beyond recognition.

03:35:09.229 --> 03:35:13.280
LIAM: Right. I tell nobody this.

03:35:13.790 --> 03:35:16.276
SAM: Just say that all again one more time, Matt.

03:35:16.276 --> 03:35:17.013
MATT: I can.

03:35:17.013 --> 03:35:18.841
LAURA: Say it all out loud.

03:35:18.841 --> 03:35:23.853
LIAM: I do read it out loud.

03:35:23.853 --> 03:35:27.752
SAM: That is hard core.

03:35:27.752 --> 03:35:29.685
TALIESIN: What's in the urn?

03:35:29.685 --> 03:35:35.124
MARISHA: Yeah, "from ashes shall rise again?" Are
we going to fight some guy who's going to chop off

03:35:35.124 --> 03:35:36.175
our legs?

03:35:36.175 --> 03:35:37.501
LAURA: What?

03:35:37.501 --> 03:35:39.949
MARISHA: It talked about chopping off our legs!

03:35:39.949 --> 03:35:44.229
LAURA: But then this sword belongs to the guy who
came to save Siff? The bounty hunter?

03:35:44.229 --> 03:35:45.909
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:35:45.909 --> 03:35:52.791
MARISHA: Yeah, the trophy was a warning. He lost
his legs.

03:35:52.791 --> 03:35:55.924
TALIESIN: I want to take a look at some of these
cages with the urns.

03:35:55.924 --> 03:36:00.851
LAURA: What was the thing about "fire or ice,"
though? It was like, "fire or ice?"

03:36:00.851 --> 03:36:06.045
LIAM: Jester, while Molly is looking around, hold
that for me. Hold it still.

03:36:06.045 --> 03:36:07.286
LAURA: Hold what still?

03:36:07.286 --> 03:36:11.189
LIAM: The sword, and I will tell you what it is,
but you have to hold it for a while, Muscles.

03:36:11.189 --> 03:36:12.142
LAURA: I'm good.

03:36:12.482 --> 03:36:15.722
MATT: As you guys are having this conversation,
you begin to notice, as you're yelling and

03:36:15.722 --> 03:36:22.319
talking, your breath is now visible in the air,
the temperature growing colder and colder still.

03:36:22.319 --> 03:36:29.337
You, looking past the chamber towards one of these
urns, you see a very faint light, a flicker within

03:36:29.337 --> 03:36:37.133
where the ashes are. As this happens, the center
circle of the chamber begins to glow darker and

03:36:37.133 --> 03:36:44.911
darker as a shadow begins to emerge from the
center of the chamber. Shifting out of the ground,

03:36:44.911 --> 03:36:52.596
some sort of whipping cloak around a humanoid
figure rises out made of pure shadow and darkness.

03:36:52.596 --> 03:36:58.116
The cloth is tattered and shifting around causing
this horrible whipping sound like a wind is

03:36:58.116 --> 03:37:03.292
blowing extremely intensely, but only localized
around this figure. As the face is visible, you

03:37:03.292 --> 03:37:09.425
see this ghastly flesh-stretched against the skull
that's still made of dark gray matter that begins

03:37:09.425 --> 03:37:19.663
to shift and move with the shadows around it. The
voice, (rasping) "Now secrets are yours." We'll pick up

03:37:19.663 --> 03:37:20.536
there next week.

03:37:20.536 --> 03:37:22.479
(yelling)

03:37:22.479 --> 03:37:22.994
SAM: Wait, what?!

03:37:22.994 --> 03:37:26.174
LIAM: Oh man.

03:37:26.174 --> 03:37:29.545
TRAVIS: Something wicked this way comes.

03:37:29.545 --> 03:37:31.575
SAM: I'm so confused!

03:37:31.575 --> 03:37:33.861
LAURA: I don't have hardly any hit points!

03:37:33.861 --> 03:37:36.794
SAM: He's going to talk to us.

03:37:36.794 --> 03:37:39.060
MARISHA: I tried to write as much as I could.

03:37:39.060 --> 03:37:41.896
LIAM: It's okay, I have one spell slot left, it's
fine.

03:37:41.896 --> 03:37:44.417
LAURA: I've got a 2nd-level and a 1st-level.

03:37:44.417 --> 03:37:45.837
MARISHA: Maybe we should run.

03:37:45.837 --> 03:37:47.437
LAURA: We should probably run.

03:37:47.437 --> 03:37:51.133
MATT: We have a week to think about it.

03:37:51.133 --> 03:37:55.869
LAURA: Was he coming up out of the teleportation
circle?

03:37:55.869 --> 03:38:03.808
MATT: You guys were all towards the bookshelf and
the tables. It emerges from the center area near

03:38:03.808 --> 03:38:07.921
the circle, not from the center of the circle, but
in that vicinity. He wasn't emerging, he wasn't

03:38:07.921 --> 03:38:12.750
teleporting in. He was rising out the ground while
Molly's off by one of the cages on the side.

03:38:12.750 --> 03:38:14.895
TALIESIN: I saw something happen in that cage.

03:38:14.895 --> 03:38:15.551
MATT: You did.

03:38:15.551 --> 03:38:16.846
TRAVIS: I'm at that other corner.

03:38:16.846 --> 03:38:18.782
MATT: Yeah. You and Molly are both at the other
corners.

03:38:18.782 --> 03:38:20.491
ASHLEY: I don't want to wait a week!

03:38:20.491 --> 03:38:23.893
SAM: May I ask: What were we sent here to get
again?

03:38:23.893 --> 03:38:26.666
MARISHA: I was going to say, I don't think we've
achieved anything.

03:38:26.666 --> 03:38:28.457
TRAVIS: No, we were supposed to get rid of the
orb.

03:38:28.457 --> 03:38:30.225
MATT: You guys were sent here to--

03:38:30.225 --> 03:38:35.446
MARISHA: He wanted us to bring back any type of
ancient research that we could find.

03:38:35.446 --> 03:38:36.283
SAM: Just research?

03:38:36.283 --> 03:38:38.388
MARISHA: But we could keep any of the spoils.

03:38:38.388 --> 03:38:41.353
LAURA: We could run away, bring the book and run
away.

03:38:41.353 --> 03:38:44.202
LIAM: All we have to say is we cleared it.

03:38:44.202 --> 03:38:48.010
TRAVIS: Yeah, if we want to be a little punk ass
bitch about it! We got to take this guy down!

03:38:48.010 --> 03:38:50.117
LAURA: This guy is way beyond our level.

03:38:50.117 --> 03:38:52.992
LIAM: Yeah, we need to do some discussion.

03:38:52.992 --> 03:38:58.319
MATT: This is a game of choices, guys. Figure out
what your choices are for next week. On that note,

03:38:58.319 --> 03:38:59.215
well done, guys!

03:38:59.215 --> 03:39:02.829
ASHLEY: I don't want to wait a week, I want to do
it right now!

03:39:02.829 --> 03:39:07.800
MATT: If it wasn't already 10:38, we could
continue.

03:39:07.800 --> 03:39:10.051
LIAM: That's nothing. I could go for another two
hours, at least.

03:39:10.051 --> 03:39:19.108
MATT: I know. But depending on what you do, could
TPK real fast. No. Thank you guys so much. Thank

03:39:19.108 --> 03:39:25.681
you for watching and tuning in. Don't forget the
awesomeness with 826LA.

03:39:25.681 --> 03:39:28.989
SAM: Archer season seven?

03:39:28.989 --> 03:39:29.644
TRAVIS: Nine.

03:39:29.644 --> 03:39:34.744
MATT: Archer season nine, D&amp;D Beyond, all our
fantastic sponsors. Pillars of Eternity II, we're

03:39:34.744 --> 03:39:39.534
super excited about that and the new comic. Check
all that stuff out. Things to hold you over until

03:39:39.534 --> 03:39:42.824
next week, at the very least.

03:39:42.824 --> 03:39:43.529
LIAM: Only cool things here. Only cool things.

03:39:43.529 --> 03:39:45.762
MATT: Thank you so much for watching. Have a
wonderful night and a wonderful week and is it

03:39:45.762 --> 03:39:47.812
Thursday yet? Good night!

03:39:47.812 --> 03:39:48.425
LIAM: No, it's not!

03:39:48.425 --> 03:51:04.530

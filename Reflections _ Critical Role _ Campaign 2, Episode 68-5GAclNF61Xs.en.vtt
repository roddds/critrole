00:00:00.204 --> 00:00:01.412
MATT: Hello, everybody,

2
00:00:01.412 --> 00:00:03.900
and welcome to Sam being incredibly slow on the take today.

3
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.041
TRAVIS: (laughs)
LIAM: That was cute.

4
00:00:05.041 --> 00:00:06.432
MATT: This is Critical Role,

5
00:00:06.432 --> 00:00:07.327
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

6
00:00:07.327 --> 00:00:09.002
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

7
00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:11.527
TRAVIS: We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

8
00:00:11.527 --> 00:00:12.693
SAM: We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

9
00:00:12.693 --> 00:00:14.293
MATT: We do on occasion.

10
00:00:14.293 --> 00:00:16.726
(laughter)
ASHLEY: Wow.

11
00:00:16.726 --> 00:00:17.820
TRAVIS: We're drinking already.

12
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.330
MATT: I see you've already started, didn't you?

13
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:21.644
Sadly, we are down Laura Bailey tonight.

14
00:00:21.644 --> 00:00:22.982
She is very ill and at home,

15
00:00:22.982 --> 00:00:24.676
so we're wishing her well.

16
00:00:24.676 --> 00:00:25.868
Travis'll--
ASHLEY: She wanted--

17
00:00:25.868 --> 00:00:26.892
MATT: I know.

18
00:00:26.892 --> 00:00:28.335
Travis will be jaegering her for the night,

19
00:00:28.335 --> 00:00:29.283
as she will be texting

20
00:00:29.283 --> 00:00:30.688
and informing us of the things

21
00:00:30.688 --> 00:00:31.909
that Jester wants to do.

22
00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:35.119
TRAVIS: No promises. No promises.

23
00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:37.811
MATT: Anyway, before we get into tonight's episode,

24
00:00:37.811 --> 00:00:39.174
in our session, let's go ahead

25
00:00:39.174 --> 00:00:40.506
and go through our announcements,

26
00:00:40.506 --> 00:00:42.872
beginning with our fantastic sponsors for the evening,

27
00:00:42.872 --> 00:00:43.764
two of which we have.

28
00:00:43.764 --> 00:00:46.308
The first one, our returning friends at D&amp;D Beyond.

29
00:00:46.308 --> 00:00:47.141
Sam.

30
00:00:47.141 --> 00:00:49.702
SAM: D&amp;D Beyond, everybody.

31
00:00:49.702 --> 00:00:52.806
Tonight, I'm going to ground break a little.

32
00:00:52.806 --> 00:00:54.392
I'm going to be groundbreaking tonight.

33
00:00:54.392 --> 00:00:55.225
TRAVIS: Tonight?

34
00:00:55.225 --> 00:00:56.421
SAM: Tonight, I'm going to do something

35
00:00:56.421 --> 00:00:57.567
that I'm pretty sure no one else

36
00:00:57.567 --> 00:00:59.669
has ever done in the world.

37
00:00:59.669 --> 00:01:02.754
I'm going to live tweet an ad.

38
00:01:02.754 --> 00:01:06.523
I'm going to be live tweeting while I'm doing the ad,

39
00:01:06.523 --> 00:01:09.216
so you guys can be watching it live

40
00:01:09.216 --> 00:01:12.858
and also following it live on my Twitter @samriegel.

41
00:01:12.858 --> 00:01:13.951
So I'll give you a second.

42
00:01:13.951 --> 00:01:16.489
Head on over to @samriegel at the Twitters

43
00:01:16.489 --> 00:01:18.923
and get ready for the live tweeting to begin.

44
00:01:18.923 --> 00:01:19.875
Are you ready?

45
00:01:19.875 --> 00:01:21.816
Okay, here we go.

46
00:01:21.816 --> 00:01:22.857

MARISHA: It's coming to Target?

65
00:02:05.666 --> 00:02:08.352
MATT: That sponsor's pretty damn great.

66
00:02:08.352 --> 00:02:09.369
TRAVIS: I never knew you could--

67
00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.075
MARISHA: Target, though!

I'm just going to do it like this.

TRAVIS: We'll do it live!

87
00:03:13.313 --> 00:03:16.308
Go to D&amp;DBeyond.com/essentials.

88
00:03:16.308 --> 00:03:19.261
The Essentials Kit is available exclusively at Target

89
00:03:19.261 --> 00:03:21.948
until September 3rd, 2019.

90
00:03:21.948 --> 00:03:25.334
If you check it out, it includes a newly designed rule book

91
00:03:25.334 --> 00:03:26.848
that onboards players by teaching them

92
00:03:26.848 --> 00:03:28.515
how to make characters and adventures.

93
00:03:28.515 --> 00:03:29.561
It's really cool.

94
00:03:29.561 --> 00:03:31.046
Please, do not look at my Twitter

95
00:03:31.046 --> 00:03:32.651
for the rest of the night. Thank you.

96
00:03:32.651 --> 00:03:34.633
TRAVIS: Wow.
SAM: I'm getting a lot of tweets.

97
00:03:34.633 --> 00:03:35.964
(laughter)

98
00:03:35.964 --> 00:03:38.131
SAM: Oh boy.
TALIESIN: I thought it was--

99
00:03:39.026 --> 00:03:40.119
apparently, I had you muted.

100
00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:41.947
I thought it was a gag for a minute,

101
00:03:41.947 --> 00:03:43.626
but yeah, I don't know what you did,

102
00:03:43.626 --> 00:03:45.133
but you pissed me off at some point.

103
00:03:45.133 --> 00:03:46.148
Yeah, here we go.
SAM: Oh, boy.

104
00:03:46.148 --> 00:03:46.981
Oh wow!

105
00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:50.540
The first one has 3,000 likes already!

106
00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.012
(laughter)

107
00:03:52.012 --> 00:03:52.892
SAM: Oh Jesus.

108
00:03:52.892 --> 00:03:54.566
(laughter)

109
00:03:54.566 --> 00:03:55.983
SAM: This is not good.

110
00:03:57.304 --> 00:03:58.917
Oh boy.

111
00:03:58.917 --> 00:04:00.650
Oh, I wrote poop a lot.

112
00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.187
(laughter)

113
00:04:03.187 --> 00:04:05.214
TRAVIS: Poop's going to be trending in the US.

114
00:04:05.214 --> 00:04:06.631
SAM: Uh-huh, oh boy.

115
00:04:08.172 --> 00:04:10.495
Wow, the internet is strange.

116
00:04:10.495 --> 00:04:12.373
(laughter)

117
00:04:12.373 --> 00:04:14.585
MATT: Well thank you, Sam,

118
00:04:14.585 --> 00:04:18.337
and I'm sorry, D&amp;D Beyond, but thank you.

119
00:04:18.337 --> 00:04:19.262
Oh, what now, Sam?

120
00:04:19.262 --> 00:04:20.095
SAM: No, no, no.

121
00:04:20.095 --> 00:04:22.474
It's about to cross like 3500.

122
00:04:22.474 --> 00:04:25.950
No, it's passed that, it's at 4000.

123
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.200
(laughter)

124
00:04:29.843 --> 00:04:30.676
MATT: Okay.

125
00:04:30.676 --> 00:04:32.161
MARISHA: He's suddenly aware of his power.

126
00:04:32.161 --> 00:04:33.195
This is bad.

127
00:04:33.195 --> 00:04:34.079
MATT: This is very dangerous.

128
00:04:34.079 --> 00:04:35.893
This is the only way.

129
00:04:35.893 --> 00:04:38.613
Laura, you're gone for one night and you see what happens?

130
00:04:38.613 --> 00:04:39.924
Thank you D&amp;D Beyond for being

131
00:04:39.924 --> 00:04:41.782
our fantastic partners this campaign.

132
00:04:41.782 --> 00:04:43.391
Following up with that, our second sponsor tonight,

133
00:04:43.391 --> 00:04:45.412
our friends at Dwarven Forge.

134
00:04:45.412 --> 00:04:46.710
(cheering)

135
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.273
So you guys, you've seen Dwarven Forge

136
00:04:48.273 --> 00:04:50.443
on the show, tremendously.

137
00:04:50.443 --> 00:04:52.224
I use it as often as I can.

138
00:04:52.224 --> 00:04:54.130
They have a new Kickstarter

139
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.853
that just launched recently for their Hellscape Terrain,

140
00:04:56.853 --> 00:04:57.686
which is pretty badass.

141
00:04:57.686 --> 00:04:59.641
You got to see some of it at the D&amp;D Live event.

142
00:04:59.641 --> 00:05:02.644
I've already gone in deep on it because I have a problem.

143
00:05:02.644 --> 00:05:04.915
It's a really, really amazing collection

144
00:05:04.915 --> 00:05:08.139
of infernal and Hellscape-themed terrain.

145
00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:12.407
There's extremely detailed, hand carved-- or hand sculpted,

146
00:05:12.407 --> 00:05:15.074
painted, and cast in Dwarvenite.

147
00:05:15.908 --> 00:05:17.818
They actually have translucent elements

148
00:05:17.818 --> 00:05:19.414
that you can put over light panels

149
00:05:19.414 --> 00:05:21.792
to have actually glowing magma that comes from underneath

150
00:05:21.792 --> 00:05:25.444
in elements, which is super awesome.

151
00:05:25.444 --> 00:05:28.514
The campaign is now live and it goes through July 1st.

152
00:05:28.514 --> 00:05:29.573
So if you want to go ahead

153
00:05:29.573 --> 00:05:31.596
and grab yourself one of the packages now,

154
00:05:31.596 --> 00:05:33.978
so you can do your own home Hellscape terrain

155
00:05:33.978 --> 00:05:38.978
with Dwarven Forge. Head to critrole.com/Hellscape.

156
00:05:39.332 --> 00:05:41.101
That'd be the place to check it out.

157
00:05:41.101 --> 00:05:43.959
I'm super excited. I hope you are, too.

158
00:05:43.959 --> 00:05:45.337
All right, couple other announcements.

159
00:05:45.337 --> 00:05:46.689
We have-- tomorrow night,

160
00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:48.901
we return to the Plane of Pandemonium

161
00:05:48.901 --> 00:05:51.124
for a very special Kickstarter reward one shot,

162
00:05:51.124 --> 00:05:52.719
the first of many.

163
00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:53.921
The Search For Bob.

164
00:05:53.921 --> 00:05:55.960
The follow up to our Search For Grog live show

165
00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.027
we did back in January.

166
00:05:58.027 --> 00:06:01.074
That is tomorrow at 7:00pm Pacific.

167
00:06:01.074 --> 00:06:01.907
Yep.

168
00:06:03.056 --> 00:06:04.818
On June 21st, which is tomorrow night,

169
00:06:04.818 --> 00:06:06.442
VOD will be available immediately

170
00:06:06.442 --> 00:06:08.029
for our Twitch subscribers

171
00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:10.401
and it'll be on our YouTube channel Sunday morning.

172
00:06:10.401 --> 00:06:12.155
But tomorrow night, 7:00pm Pacific

173
00:06:12.155 --> 00:06:14.486
for The Search For Bob.

174
00:06:14.486 --> 00:06:15.886
Be there.

175
00:06:15.886 --> 00:06:17.877
Or not, but be there, please.

176
00:06:18.833 --> 00:06:21.789
Quick housekeeping note, just for everyone.

177
00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:24.859
We're taking a brief hiatus the week of July 1st

178
00:06:24.859 --> 00:06:26.789
from our just live programming schedule.

179
00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:28.624
We're going to be dark that week,

180
00:06:28.624 --> 00:06:30.148
but we'll be returning in full force

181
00:06:30.148 --> 00:06:33.759
with the Talks Machina Tuesday, July 9th.

182
00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:35.420
We're going to take a much needed week off.

183
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.080
TRAVIS: Yeah!

184
00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.126
Celebrate the USA!

185
00:06:38.126 --> 00:06:39.465
MATT: Yep!

186
00:06:39.465 --> 00:06:42.870
SAM: ♪ I'm proud to be an American ♪

187
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:45.711
♪ Where at least I know I'm free ♪

188
00:06:45.711 --> 00:06:46.894
TRAVIS: That's really not--

189
00:06:46.894 --> 00:06:49.134
LIAM: Eldritch Blast!
SAM: Eldritch Blast!

190
00:06:49.134 --> 00:06:51.584
(laughter)

191
00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:55.090
MATT: Since Laura's not here, I get to do some merch bits.

192
00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:57.728
So we do have a couple things.

193
00:06:57.728 --> 00:06:59.500
We have, in celebration of tomorrow's one-shot,

194
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.807
we have our Search For Grog heat changing mug here.

195
00:07:03.807 --> 00:07:05.864
It is normally just a dark image,

196
00:07:05.864 --> 00:07:07.157
but with some hot beverage

197
00:07:07.157 --> 00:07:09.668
it becomes Grog with a little bit of graffiti on there

198
00:07:09.668 --> 00:07:12.759
to look like our githzerai friend, Bob.

199
00:07:12.759 --> 00:07:16.225
It will be available right now?

200
00:07:16.225 --> 00:07:19.805
Right now, in the US and UK shops.

201
00:07:19.805 --> 00:07:21.000
That's really hot!

202
00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.040
(laughter)

203
00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.814
MATT: Don't do that.

204
00:07:24.814 --> 00:07:27.318
Also, in our US shop, soon to be our UK shops

205
00:07:27.318 --> 00:07:31.894
in a few months, we have the return of glorious Gilmore's--

206
00:07:31.894 --> 00:07:32.936
Gilmore's Glorious Goods shirts.

207
00:07:32.936 --> 00:07:35.060
The old school design has returned!

208
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.928
SAM: Classic!
TALIESIN: It's got a little bit--

209
00:07:36.928 --> 00:07:38.113
They did a little bit--
MATT: A little bit of

210
00:07:38.113 --> 00:07:39.408
the fading on it so that it looks like it's

211
00:07:39.408 --> 00:07:42.015
gotten some love, so it looks like you bought it years ago.

212
00:07:42.015 --> 00:07:43.505
You know, seen some stuff.

213
00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:44.943
Super comfy.

214
00:07:44.943 --> 00:07:48.360
(as Gilmore) So don't let me down, please try it out.

215
00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:52.333
I believe that's it.

216
00:07:52.333 --> 00:07:53.774
TRAVIS: There's got to be more to say!

217
00:07:53.774 --> 00:07:55.980
We don't want to hop in yet.

218
00:07:55.980 --> 00:08:00.980
SAM: My poop tweet has 6200 likes and 450 retweets.

219
00:08:01.004 --> 00:08:03.311
TALIESIN: Are we going to have to mind wipe him again?

220
00:08:03.311 --> 00:08:04.144
TRAVIS: Might have to.

221
00:08:04.144 --> 00:08:05.224
MATT: It's the only way.

222
00:08:05.224 --> 00:08:06.315
All right.

223
00:08:06.315 --> 00:08:08.195
So on that note, Sam.

224
00:08:08.195 --> 00:08:11.012
Let's go ahead and jump into tonight's episode of

225
00:08:11.012 --> 00:08:12.256
Critical Role.

226
00:08:12.256 --> 00:08:14.197

MATT: And welcome back.

265
00:09:51.115 --> 00:09:52.816
(laughter)

266
00:09:52.816 --> 00:09:54.866
TRAVIS: Fuck the oranges.

267
00:09:56.423 --> 00:09:58.765
MATT: So last we left off.

268
00:09:59.826 --> 00:10:01.159
The Mighty Nein.

269
00:10:03.488 --> 00:10:04.451
We good?

270
00:10:04.451 --> 00:10:05.753
LIAM: I'm going to choke.

271
00:10:05.753 --> 00:10:07.846
(laughing)

272
00:10:07.846 --> 00:10:08.706
TALIESIN: Laughing at your own joke?

273
00:10:08.706 --> 00:10:09.728
LIAM: Yeah.

274
00:10:09.728 --> 00:10:11.608
MATT: Exactly, oh man.

275
00:10:11.608 --> 00:10:13.188
So last we left off,

276
00:10:13.188 --> 00:10:15.216
The Mighty Nein had found themselves

277
00:10:15.216 --> 00:10:18.033
somewhere underneath the Penumbra Range mountains

278
00:10:18.033 --> 00:10:20.186
to the West of Bazzoxan,

279
00:10:20.186 --> 00:10:22.265
chasing down this figure known as Obann.

280
00:10:22.265 --> 00:10:23.707
This mysterious drow,

281
00:10:23.707 --> 00:10:26.259
who seems to have been involved

282
00:10:26.259 --> 00:10:27.621
with these strange devices

283
00:10:27.621 --> 00:10:29.187
that are causing portals to the Abyss

284
00:10:29.187 --> 00:10:32.654
to open up in locations across Xhorhas.

285
00:10:32.654 --> 00:10:34.901
You've given chase across the Barbed Fields,

286
00:10:34.901 --> 00:10:36.793
found the entrance to this strange series

287
00:10:36.793 --> 00:10:40.293
of underground tunnels and this sealed off

288
00:10:41.426 --> 00:10:44.022
sort of citadel/tomb. You're not entirely certain

289
00:10:44.022 --> 00:10:44.976
what its purpose is,

290
00:10:44.976 --> 00:10:47.694
though you have encountered a number of

291
00:10:47.694 --> 00:10:50.685
angelic pieces of imagery and statues,

292
00:10:50.685 --> 00:10:52.460
themselves bleeding from the eyes

293
00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.819
as these elements have been breached.

294
00:10:54.819 --> 00:10:57.550
You've gathered a few clues, you've made your way through,

295
00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:01.351
dealt with some sort of demon twisted spiders

296
00:11:01.351 --> 00:11:05.543
and destroyed their brood before it hatched.

297
00:11:05.543 --> 00:11:07.065
You proceeded to find your way

298
00:11:07.065 --> 00:11:11.854
down a massive fog enclosed tower of sorts,

299
00:11:11.854 --> 00:11:13.827
setting off a trap that caused a repeating

300
00:11:13.827 --> 00:11:16.798
and escalating electric field to burst through,

301
00:11:16.798 --> 00:11:19.627
as well as being attacked by some invisible force.

302
00:11:19.627 --> 00:11:22.556
Some unseen assassin that seems

303
00:11:22.556 --> 00:11:25.625
to flow through the mist, unwatched.

304
00:11:25.625 --> 00:11:26.826
You managed to escape that,

305
00:11:26.826 --> 00:11:29.406
into a chamber in which you found a pedestal,

306
00:11:29.406 --> 00:11:31.958
with three empty bowls

307
00:11:31.958 --> 00:11:34.871
and a seemingly endless supply of corpses beneath,

308
00:11:34.871 --> 00:11:36.176
upon two ramps.

309
00:11:36.176 --> 00:11:37.686
Upon which triggering it,

310
00:11:37.686 --> 00:11:40.477
some of these corpses began to come to life in waves

311
00:11:40.477 --> 00:11:41.516
and you dashed them aside,

312
00:11:41.516 --> 00:11:43.509
fought them off as they attempted to swarm you.

313
00:11:43.509 --> 00:11:45.702
Some of them seeming to carry

314
00:11:45.702 --> 00:11:48.097
some form of glowing enchantment

315
00:11:48.097 --> 00:11:50.520
upon the leftover heart, temporarily.

316
00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.325
Passing this, you made your way now,

317
00:11:52.325 --> 00:11:55.509
to the precipice of a cliffside

318
00:11:55.509 --> 00:11:58.525
that falls into a lightless chasm below

319
00:11:58.525 --> 00:12:00.392
and an iron bridge that disappears

320
00:12:00.392 --> 00:12:03.543
into the darkness before you.

321
00:12:03.543 --> 00:12:05.761
You've since decided to take a night's rest

322
00:12:05.761 --> 00:12:08.328
as you found yourselves rather spent.

323
00:12:08.328 --> 00:12:10.034
Loud noises seem to call

324
00:12:10.034 --> 00:12:13.592
some strange cacophony of

325
00:12:13.592 --> 00:12:15.860
whispers and voices and screams

326
00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.162
that you are uncertain of the source,

327
00:12:18.162 --> 00:12:21.679
so silence seems to be golden for the night.

328
00:12:21.679 --> 00:12:26.679
Last we left off, you had created yourself a Tiny Hut,

329
00:12:26.822 --> 00:12:29.021
and you all had been attempting to go to sleep.

330
00:12:29.021 --> 00:12:30.706
TRAVIS: I don't like the way he said that.

331
00:12:30.706 --> 00:12:31.846
SAM: Yeah, we're just going to go to sleep.

332
00:12:31.846 --> 00:12:33.312
TRAVIS: Attempting to go to sleep.

333
00:12:33.312 --> 00:12:34.276
SAM: Attempting to go to sleep.

334
00:12:34.276 --> 00:12:36.535
That's how you normally talk about going to sleep, right?

335
00:12:36.535 --> 00:12:39.175
You say, "Hey guys, I'm attempting to go to sleep."

336
00:12:39.175 --> 00:12:40.708
MATT: Most of my nights are very much

337
00:12:40.708 --> 00:12:41.799
attempting to go to sleep.

338
00:12:41.799 --> 00:12:43.526
(laughter)

339
00:12:43.526 --> 00:12:44.938
MATT: So are you guys taking a watch

340
00:12:44.938 --> 00:12:45.952
or are you all going to bed at once?

341
00:12:45.952 --> 00:12:47.273
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're taking a watch!

342
00:12:47.273 --> 00:12:49.795
MATT: All right, who's taking first watch?

343
00:12:49.795 --> 00:12:53.469
MARISHA: I think spell casters should be sleeping.

344
00:12:53.469 --> 00:12:55.677
LIAM: I'm passed the fuck out already.

345
00:12:55.677 --> 00:12:57.044
MARISHA: Spell casters sleep.

346
00:12:57.044 --> 00:12:58.228
TALIESIN: I'll take final watch.

347
00:12:58.228 --> 00:12:59.845
ASHLEY: I'll take first watch.
MARISHA: Just in case

348
00:12:59.845 --> 00:13:01.972
we don't get a full rest.
MATT: Okay, Yasha.

349
00:13:01.972 --> 00:13:04.724
SAM: I'll stay up with you, Yasha.

350
00:13:04.724 --> 00:13:07.474
MATT: Okay, Nott and Yasha, up first.

351
00:13:09.592 --> 00:13:10.773
SAM: Do we die?

352
00:13:10.773 --> 00:13:12.026
(laughter)

353
00:13:12.026 --> 00:13:13.428
MATT: Roll a d20.

354
00:13:13.428 --> 00:13:14.913
SAM: Roll the d20.
ASHLEY: Both of us?

355
00:13:14.913 --> 00:13:16.835
MATT: Both of you.

356
00:13:16.835 --> 00:13:19.058
SAM: Okay, okay, 16.

357
00:13:19.058 --> 00:13:21.096
Good first roll of the night.

358
00:13:21.096 --> 00:13:22.670
TRAVIS: Just a straight up d20?

359
00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:24.620
MATT: Add your perception bonus.

360
00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:26.590
MARISHA: Oh boy.
SAM: 16 still.

361
00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:28.520
MATT: All right.
ASHLEY: 12.

362
00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.483
MATT: 12?
Okay.

363
00:13:30.483 --> 00:13:32.628
ASHLEY: Which is a good roll.

364
00:13:32.628 --> 00:13:35.186
MATT: Mm-hmm.
ASHLEY: Right?

365
00:13:37.875 --> 00:13:41.241
MATT: Your time keeping watch goes through uneventful.

366
00:13:41.241 --> 00:13:44.158
TRAVIS: Oh my god. God! I don't need this.

367
00:13:45.278 --> 00:13:47.965
SAM: Yasha, are you getting nervous

368
00:13:47.965 --> 00:13:52.084
as we get farther and farther into this crevasse?

369
00:13:52.084 --> 00:13:53.530
Cave, cavern?

370
00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:57.317
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm getting progressively more nervous.

371
00:13:57.317 --> 00:13:58.150
SAM: Really?

372
00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:59.641
You--
ASHLEY: Yes.

373
00:13:59.641 --> 00:14:01.448
SAM: You have that ability?

374
00:14:01.448 --> 00:14:03.532
I've never seen you get scared, I don't think.

375
00:14:03.532 --> 00:14:04.471
ASHLEY: I don't really get scared,

376
00:14:04.471 --> 00:14:05.760
but I think it's more,

377
00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:09.886
I'm just nervous about the unknown in this situation.

378
00:14:09.886 --> 00:14:12.886
I don't know if it's going to...

379
00:14:13.849 --> 00:14:16.002
I just don't know what we're walking into.

380
00:14:16.002 --> 00:14:17.678
SAM: Sometimes when I'm nervous like that,

381
00:14:17.678 --> 00:14:21.145
I try to think of like, what's the worst it could be, right?

382
00:14:21.145 --> 00:14:24.051
Like what's the absolute worst?

383
00:14:24.051 --> 00:14:27.827
For this one, I don't know.

384
00:14:27.827 --> 00:14:31.043
Maybe like,

385
00:14:31.043 --> 00:14:34.834
big balls of lightning

386
00:14:34.834 --> 00:14:37.869
hitting us all at the same time in our genitals

387
00:14:37.869 --> 00:14:40.381
and just being really painful?

388
00:14:40.381 --> 00:14:41.714
ASHLEY: Yeah, or like,

389
00:14:42.972 --> 00:14:47.522
you know, if they tortured us

390
00:14:47.522 --> 00:14:49.545
for years and years and years.

391
00:14:49.545 --> 00:14:52.064
You know, like, chained us up or something

392
00:14:52.064 --> 00:14:55.987
and then we just die because we're just being pulled apart,

393
00:14:55.987 --> 00:14:58.736
our limbs being pulled.

394
00:14:58.736 --> 00:15:00.205
Those are things that I'm thinking.

395
00:15:00.205 --> 00:15:01.455
SAM: Jesus Christ!

396
00:15:02.415 --> 00:15:03.976
I mean, mine was sort of an instant death,

397
00:15:03.976 --> 00:15:06.893
but painful, but years and years?

398
00:15:06.893 --> 00:15:08.917
ASHLEY: It could be both of those things, you know?

399
00:15:08.917 --> 00:15:10.167
SAM: You are dark.

400
00:15:12.151 --> 00:15:12.984
ASHLEY: Yeah.

401
00:15:13.831 --> 00:15:15.864
SAM: God, now I'm truly scared.

402
00:15:15.864 --> 00:15:17.197
ASHLEY: Oh, I'm sorry.

403
00:15:19.581 --> 00:15:22.331
I'm not very good at pep talking.

404
00:15:23.507 --> 00:15:27.303
I'm proud of you for not drinking so much.

405
00:15:27.303 --> 00:15:30.215
At least, because you've had to.

406
00:15:30.215 --> 00:15:32.262
SAM: Yeah, that's not-- it's not by choice,

407
00:15:32.262 --> 00:15:34.917
and I would be drinking right now if I had some,

408
00:15:34.917 --> 00:15:38.453
so I don't know if it's something to be praised, but--

409
00:15:38.453 --> 00:15:39.744
ASHLEY: Well, it's like you're being

410
00:15:39.744 --> 00:15:41.837
forced to feel feelings.

411
00:15:41.837 --> 00:15:43.684
SAM: Do you think our friends would be upset with me

412
00:15:43.684 --> 00:15:45.218
if I rifled through their belongings

413
00:15:45.218 --> 00:15:46.968
looking for my flask?

414
00:15:48.868 --> 00:15:51.368
ASHLEY: Probably, that feels very...

415
00:15:53.998 --> 00:15:57.056
That's-- I don't know if you should do that.

416
00:15:57.056 --> 00:15:59.056
SAM: But what if I find it?

417
00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:01.343
ASHLEY: Well...

418
00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:07.135
Who do you feel like you want to check?

419
00:16:07.135 --> 00:16:09.468
Who do you feel like has it?

420
00:16:11.996 --> 00:16:13.893
SAM: They're all so shifty.

421
00:16:13.893 --> 00:16:16.770
(wheezing laughter)
ASHLEY: They're sleeping.

422
00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:17.603
SAM: I know.

423
00:16:20.635 --> 00:16:21.894
TRAVIS: Mouth-open sleeping.

424
00:16:21.894 --> 00:16:25.857
SAM: I mean, Caleb has killed his own family members.

425
00:16:25.857 --> 00:16:28.107
He's-- he could do anything.

426
00:16:29.226 --> 00:16:32.095
Beauregard is a known mail fraud convict.

427
00:16:32.095 --> 00:16:34.072
LIAM: That is new information to you.

428
00:16:34.072 --> 00:16:35.098
Brand new.

429
00:16:35.098 --> 00:16:36.939
SAM: Fjord is,

430
00:16:37.773 --> 00:16:39.406
he's just mean.

431
00:16:41.674 --> 00:16:44.795
Caduceus, he wouldn't do that. He's a nice guy.

432
00:16:44.795 --> 00:16:46.666
TALIESIN: (laughter)

433
00:16:46.666 --> 00:16:47.771
SAM: Jester?

434
00:16:47.771 --> 00:16:49.208
I'm not sure about Jester.

435
00:16:49.208 --> 00:16:50.492
I mean, I trust her, of course.

436
00:16:50.492 --> 00:16:53.980
She's the cutest of the cute, but at the same time,

437
00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:56.736
it's like, do we know much about her

438
00:16:56.736 --> 00:17:00.074
other than she likes to deface property.

439
00:17:00.074 --> 00:17:04.620
She likes committing petty theft, or petty crimes anyway.

440
00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:07.237
ASHLEY: Yeah, but I don't think she would do such a thing.

441
00:17:07.237 --> 00:17:09.890
SAM: I don't think so. She's sweet.

442
00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:11.999
ASHLEY: What do you mean Caleb killed his whole family?

443
00:17:11.999 --> 00:17:14.339
SAM: I, you know, it's a figure of speech where I'm from.

444
00:17:14.339 --> 00:17:18.359
(laughter)

445
00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:21.622
You know, it's like, it's like...

446
00:17:21.622 --> 00:17:24.781
ASHLEY: What does the figure of speech mean?

447
00:17:24.781 --> 00:17:28.114
Like how would you use it in a sentence?

448
00:17:31.007 --> 00:17:34.368
SAM: "Oh, do you have that money I owe you?"

449
00:17:34.368 --> 00:17:37.596
"Oh, no, I don't have it yet.

450
00:17:37.596 --> 00:17:39.763
"I killed my whole family.

451
00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:43.649
"I'll have it for you next week."

452
00:17:43.649 --> 00:17:46.336
It's just sort of like a general, general like,

453
00:17:46.336 --> 00:17:48.770
"Oh, drat."

454
00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:49.926
You know, that sort of a thing.

455
00:17:49.926 --> 00:17:52.342
ASHLEY: Oh, so for you it's like,

456
00:17:52.342 --> 00:17:55.263
"I don't have my flask. I've killed my whole family."

457
00:17:55.263 --> 00:17:58.430
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a figure of--

458
00:17:59.643 --> 00:18:00.810
ASHLEY: Frustration?

459
00:18:01.679 --> 00:18:02.512
SAM: Yep.

460
00:18:02.512 --> 00:18:06.845
It's the equivalent to like, "Aw snap."

461
00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:10.393
ASHLEY: Wait, where are you from again?

462
00:18:10.393 --> 00:18:12.430
(laughter)

463
00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:17.430
SAM: That, I mean, it's a halfling thing?

464
00:18:17.735 --> 00:18:19.224
ASHLEY: It's a halfling thing.
SAM: Listen,

465
00:18:19.224 --> 00:18:22.268
I didn't mean to tell you that he...

466
00:18:22.268 --> 00:18:24.146
ASHLEY: No, I'll just make sure to use it in the group

467
00:18:24.146 --> 00:18:25.221
around everyone just to--

468
00:18:25.221 --> 00:18:27.059
SAM: Please don't ever say that out loud!

469
00:18:27.059 --> 00:18:29.127
ASHLEY: You know, it's like I sound trendy or something.

470
00:18:29.127 --> 00:18:30.436
SAM: Please do not ever say that in front of the group,

471
00:18:30.436 --> 00:18:31.847
at all, ever, please.

472
00:18:31.847 --> 00:18:35.881
Listen, Caleb has some secrets in his past

473
00:18:35.881 --> 00:18:39.156
that maybe I shouldn't have mentioned.

474
00:18:39.156 --> 00:18:40.777
I forgot a little bit.

475
00:18:40.777 --> 00:18:42.911
I can't think straight right now, all right?

476
00:18:42.911 --> 00:18:44.592
I'm jonesing hard!

477
00:18:44.592 --> 00:18:46.830
I can't, I can't think straight,

478
00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:50.656
and he might have not told you that aspect of his life,

479
00:18:50.656 --> 00:18:53.945
but it's not something that he likes to talk about,

480
00:18:53.945 --> 00:18:57.528
so maybe just keep this betwixt you and me?

481
00:18:58.613 --> 00:19:01.446
ASHLEY: So he did kill his whole family?

482
00:19:03.194 --> 00:19:06.484
SAM: I mean not grandparents or anything.

483
00:19:06.484 --> 00:19:09.944
There could be extended family that still lives

484
00:19:09.944 --> 00:19:12.422
that he didn't, you know, murder.

485
00:19:12.422 --> 00:19:14.488
ASHLEY: Listen, I'm not one to judge, so.

486
00:19:14.488 --> 00:19:16.913
SAM: Really, because you've killed your own family members?

487
00:19:17.938 --> 00:19:18.988
ASHLEY: (shocked) No.

488
00:19:18.988 --> 00:19:22.446
(laughter)

489
00:19:24.432 --> 00:19:25.284
SAM: He was--

490
00:19:25.284 --> 00:19:26.986
it was a different time. He was brainwashed.

491
00:19:26.986 --> 00:19:28.722
It's a whole thing for him.

492
00:19:28.722 --> 00:19:31.052
Don't, please don't judge him poorly because of me.

493
00:19:31.052 --> 00:19:32.935
I feel terrible now.

494
00:19:32.935 --> 00:19:35.562
ASHLEY: I would never do such a thing, don't worry.

495
00:19:35.562 --> 00:19:36.395
I won't...

496
00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:39.143
I won't say anything.

497
00:19:39.143 --> 00:19:43.103
I wouldn't throw you... under the... bridge.

498
00:19:43.103 --> 00:19:44.976
SAM: Is that an expression where you're from?

499
00:19:44.976 --> 00:19:46.337
ASHLEY: It's an expression where I'm from.

500
00:19:46.337 --> 00:19:48.668
SAM: Actually, we're next to a bridge into the Abyss.

501
00:19:48.668 --> 00:19:52.140
You wouldn't actually throw me over the bridge

502
00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:54.836
that is 25 feet that way, right?

503
00:19:54.836 --> 00:19:56.894
ASHLEY: I was trying to do the thing.

504
00:19:56.894 --> 00:19:58.319
SAM: Maybe don't say that expression

505
00:19:58.319 --> 00:20:01.045
when we're right next to a bridge.

506
00:20:01.045 --> 00:20:04.200
ASHLEY: I'm sorry, I just-- I was trying to do the thing,

507
00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.747
like I killed my family, I'll throw you under a bridge.

508
00:20:06.747 --> 00:20:07.671
SAM: I get it.

509
00:20:07.671 --> 00:20:09.907
(laughter)

510
00:20:09.907 --> 00:20:11.907
ASHLEY: I'm learning how to people.

511
00:20:11.907 --> 00:20:13.232
SAM: Man.

512
00:20:16.458 --> 00:20:18.837
ASHLEY: Well, should we go to sleep?

513
00:20:18.837 --> 00:20:20.183
SAM: I would hope so.

514
00:20:20.183 --> 00:20:21.683
I will attempt to.

515
00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:26.363
ASHLEY: Maybe does Beau have anymore booze in her flask

516
00:20:26.363 --> 00:20:27.716
or did you drink it all?

517
00:20:27.716 --> 00:20:28.549
SAM: Does she have a flask?

518
00:20:28.549 --> 00:20:31.096
I can rifle through her stuff if you give me permission to.

519
00:20:31.096 --> 00:20:33.058
ASHLEY: No, I don't think you should.

520
00:20:33.058 --> 00:20:35.808
You should always ask permission.

521
00:20:37.081 --> 00:20:38.503
SAM: Good night, Yasha.

522
00:20:38.503 --> 00:20:40.097
ASHLEY: Good night, Nott.

523
00:20:40.097 --> 00:20:42.132
Sleep well, okay?

524
00:20:42.132 --> 00:20:43.299
SAM: Okay.

525
00:20:43.299 --> 00:20:44.773
Please don't throw me over the bridge.

526
00:20:44.773 --> 00:20:48.089
(laughter)

527
00:20:48.089 --> 00:20:50.302
ASHLEY: I'll try not to.

528
00:20:50.302 --> 00:20:51.135
MATT: All right.

529
00:20:51.135 --> 00:20:53.380
Who's taking the next watch?
(laughter)

530
00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:54.380
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

531
00:20:56.754 --> 00:20:58.553
MARISHA: I need a ringtone of Ashley saying,

532
00:20:58.553 --> 00:21:02.343
"I killed my whole family, I'll throw you under a bridge."

533
00:21:02.343 --> 00:21:03.855
LIAM: That was like a flaming dumpster

534
00:21:03.855 --> 00:21:05.938
just rolling down a hill.

535
00:21:06.816 --> 00:21:08.807
TRAVIS: Oh, wow.

536
00:21:08.807 --> 00:21:10.464
MARISHA: I'll take next watch.

537
00:21:10.464 --> 00:21:13.935
MATT: Beauregard, and Caleb, all right.

538
00:21:13.935 --> 00:21:18.079
Will you both roll perception checks for me, please?

539
00:21:18.971 --> 00:21:21.221
TALIESIN: Charmander die.

540
00:21:23.688 --> 00:21:25.038
TRAVIS: Is that really what that is?

541
00:21:25.038 --> 00:21:26.759
MARISHA: I think that is.

542
00:21:26.759 --> 00:21:29.419
LIAM: 22.
MARISHA: Natural one.

543
00:21:29.419 --> 00:21:30.669
MATT: Okay.

544
00:21:31.549 --> 00:21:32.382
MARISHA: Oh no.

545
00:21:34.344 --> 00:21:37.091
TRAVIS: He's wearing the red vest.

546
00:21:37.091 --> 00:21:39.742
MARISHA: Red vest Mercer.
MATT: Look, guys.

547
00:21:39.742 --> 00:21:43.294
Critical Role Land...

548
00:21:43.294 --> 00:21:44.414
TRAVIS: We're going to make it happen, Matt.

549
00:21:44.414 --> 00:21:45.822
We're going to make it happen.

550
00:21:47.667 --> 00:21:51.645
(heavy, scared breathing)
(laughter)

551
00:21:51.645 --> 00:21:56.187
MATT: So during your watch, both of you...

552
00:21:58.182 --> 00:22:01.065
Quiet, uneventful.

553
00:22:01.065 --> 00:22:04.191
Just surrounded in shadow, in the very edge of your vision

554
00:22:04.191 --> 00:22:08.238
that ends where that cliff itself ends

555
00:22:08.238 --> 00:22:10.334
and the bridge begins.

556
00:22:10.334 --> 00:22:13.834
Nothing else seems to draw your attention.

557
00:22:17.235 --> 00:22:21.902
LIAM: Do you ever wonder what we will see on the other side?

558
00:22:23.737 --> 00:22:26.098
MARISHA: Of what, of the bridge?

559
00:22:26.098 --> 00:22:27.437
LIAM: Oh, that too.

560
00:22:27.437 --> 00:22:28.962
MARISHA: Oh, because that's all I'm thinking about

561
00:22:28.962 --> 00:22:29.795
right now.

562
00:22:33.191 --> 00:22:34.757
The other side of what?

563
00:22:36.013 --> 00:22:37.607
Feels like that could mean a lot.

564
00:22:37.607 --> 00:22:39.035
In our line of work.

565
00:22:39.035 --> 00:22:41.754
LIAM: Life.
MARISHA: Yeah, wow.

566
00:22:41.754 --> 00:22:43.469
You went for like--

567
00:22:43.469 --> 00:22:46.042
LIAM: Go big or go home.
MARISHA: -- the deepest one.

568
00:22:46.042 --> 00:22:48.259
Yeah.
LIAM: We're pretty deep right now.

569
00:22:48.259 --> 00:22:49.617
MARISHA: Yeah.

570
00:22:53.496 --> 00:22:54.579
I don't know.

571
00:22:55.502 --> 00:23:00.502
I'm a little too concerned with what's going on in this life

572
00:23:00.674 --> 00:23:04.341
before I start worrying about what's beyond.

573
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:07.697
LIAM: I don't know that I worry about it.

574
00:23:07.697 --> 00:23:10.730
I'm curious though.

575
00:23:13.502 --> 00:23:14.419
I assume...

576
00:23:17.517 --> 00:23:21.017
My version of whatever it is is not great.

577
00:23:23.444 --> 00:23:24.486
MARISHA: Oh...

578
00:23:27.158 --> 00:23:30.734
I wouldn't think that way.

579
00:23:32.501 --> 00:23:37.085
If everyone was judged by those standards,

580
00:23:37.085 --> 00:23:42.079
then I think it doesn't look great for a lot of us.

581
00:23:42.079 --> 00:23:44.246
(sighing)

582
00:23:45.154 --> 00:23:48.404
I mean, I guess what I'm saying is I'll

583
00:23:49.399 --> 00:23:51.399
be joining you, I guess.

584
00:23:52.903 --> 00:23:54.498
LIAM: Oh, well, maybe you can crawl down

585
00:23:54.498 --> 00:23:57.946
several stories to me and say hello.

586
00:23:57.946 --> 00:24:00.107
MARISHA: Do you want a berry?

587
00:24:00.107 --> 00:24:02.172
LIAM: Yeah, do you want a drink?

588
00:24:02.172 --> 00:24:04.167
MARISHA: I gave all my booze to Nott.

589
00:24:04.167 --> 00:24:06.208
LIAM: Yeah, but I have a bottle of whiskey.

590
00:24:06.208 --> 00:24:08.297
MARISHA: What?
LIAM: If you want,

591
00:24:08.297 --> 00:24:10.714
I'm going to have some.
MARISHA: Yes.

592
00:24:11.701 --> 00:24:14.758
Are you keeping it from Nott, or keeping it for Nott?

593
00:24:14.758 --> 00:24:16.417
LIAM: I don't know really.

594
00:24:16.417 --> 00:24:17.463
These are good.

595
00:24:17.463 --> 00:24:18.296
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

596
00:24:22.052 --> 00:24:23.802
LIAM: You know, I--

597
00:24:25.417 --> 00:24:29.098
I spent so much time with her on the road

598
00:24:29.098 --> 00:24:31.749
and I have not known her off of it

599
00:24:31.749 --> 00:24:35.304
until we got her husband back to her.

600
00:24:35.304 --> 00:24:37.973
I mean, it's been nice to see.

601
00:24:37.973 --> 00:24:39.056
Her with him.

602
00:24:41.179 --> 00:24:45.846
I don't know what to do with myself as much.

603
00:24:49.054 --> 00:24:50.875
It's very awkward.

604
00:24:50.875 --> 00:24:55.066
We developed, you know,

605
00:24:55.066 --> 00:24:56.649
a unique relationship

606
00:24:56.649 --> 00:24:59.181
and I feel awkward.

607
00:25:01.639 --> 00:25:04.581
She used to, you know,

608
00:25:04.581 --> 00:25:06.306
we slept on the side of the road a lot

609
00:25:06.306 --> 00:25:11.197
and would sleep next to each other in the cold

610
00:25:11.197 --> 00:25:15.324
and I feel strangely foolish about it now,

611
00:25:15.324 --> 00:25:19.867
but it didn't seem foolish before, but it does now.

612
00:25:19.867 --> 00:25:21.456
These have an after taste to them.

613
00:25:21.456 --> 00:25:22.762
MARISHA: Yeah, they're a little bitter.

614
00:25:22.762 --> 00:25:25.514
They've been in my pocket for quite a long time.

615
00:25:25.514 --> 00:25:28.010
LIAM: How long?
MARISHA: They're starting to ferment.

616
00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:30.260
LIAM: Oh, that's okay.
MARISHA: I know.

617
00:25:32.051 --> 00:25:34.972
So what now?

618
00:25:34.972 --> 00:25:37.875
You feel awkward because of

619
00:25:37.875 --> 00:25:42.100
a close relationship with a friend?

620
00:25:46.819 --> 00:25:47.652
LIAM: A little bit.

621
00:25:47.652 --> 00:25:51.722
She's found herself or found what she's looking for,

622
00:25:51.722 --> 00:25:53.389
not entirely, but...

623
00:25:55.991 --> 00:25:59.467
I don't know what I'm talking about.

624
00:25:59.467 --> 00:26:02.205
We just had a routine.

625
00:26:02.205 --> 00:26:04.372
I like routines, somewhat.

626
00:26:05.288 --> 00:26:09.607
Probably from so many years of study.

627
00:26:09.607 --> 00:26:11.307
MARISHA: Feeling replaced?

628
00:26:13.357 --> 00:26:15.748
Are you jealous?

629
00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:19.299
LIAM: Yeah, probably a little bit.

630
00:26:19.299 --> 00:26:20.132
MARISHA: Aw.

631
00:26:21.446 --> 00:26:25.279
That actually makes me feel kind of reassured.

632
00:26:28.879 --> 00:26:32.462
It's like the most basic human emotion, so,

633
00:26:33.674 --> 00:26:36.770
you're not a total lost cause.

634
00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:40.167
LIAM: Well.
MARISHA: That was a joke.

635
00:26:40.167 --> 00:26:42.144
God, fuck, I need to work on my jokes.

636
00:26:42.144 --> 00:26:43.561
LIAM: I knew, I knew.

637
00:26:44.526 --> 00:26:47.377
MARISHA: My delivery is just still not like...

638
00:26:47.377 --> 00:26:48.549
LIAM: Yeah, you were deadpan.

639
00:26:48.549 --> 00:26:53.383
You're very deadpan.
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm sorry, yeah.

640
00:26:53.383 --> 00:26:54.216
Anyway.

641
00:26:55.375 --> 00:26:59.068
She's still your friend, you know that, right?

642
00:26:59.068 --> 00:27:00.696
LIAM: Yeah.

643
00:27:00.696 --> 00:27:04.371
MARISHA: No matter what

644
00:27:04.371 --> 00:27:07.971
she goes off and does,

645
00:27:07.971 --> 00:27:10.379
you'll always be partners.

646
00:27:11.637 --> 00:27:13.662
At least at, you know,

647
00:27:15.294 --> 00:27:16.808
that memory of being partners

648
00:27:16.808 --> 00:27:19.903
at a certain time of your life.

649
00:27:19.903 --> 00:27:20.736
LIAM: Yeah.

650
00:27:22.139 --> 00:27:22.972
Yeah.

651
00:27:26.611 --> 00:27:27.869
MARISHA: Anyway.

652
00:27:30.844 --> 00:27:34.094
LIAM: I guess I'm just going to think about

653
00:27:35.327 --> 00:27:37.217
the good days?

654
00:27:37.217 --> 00:27:38.383
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

655
00:27:40.564 --> 00:27:43.097
Think about the good days.

656
00:27:45.221 --> 00:27:50.125
LIAM: Thousand yard stare into the void past the bridge.

657
00:27:50.125 --> 00:27:52.125
MARISHA: I eventually pass out.

658
00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:57.080
MATT: You as well, Caleb?

659
00:27:57.080 --> 00:28:00.668
LIAM: Yeah, I just stay up for an extra five minutes

660
00:28:00.668 --> 00:28:02.870
and just look at the group a bit.

661
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:04.067
MATT: Okay.

662
00:28:04.067 --> 00:28:04.999
You finish your watch.

663
00:28:04.999 --> 00:28:07.191
Who's taking last watch while the rest of them rest?

664
00:28:07.191 --> 00:28:08.609
TRAVIS: Sure.

665
00:28:08.609 --> 00:28:10.984
MATT: Caduceus and Fjord.

666
00:28:10.984 --> 00:28:12.641
TRAVIS: I'll give you advantage.

667
00:28:12.641 --> 00:28:13.548
TALIESIN: Can we do that?

668
00:28:13.548 --> 00:28:14.758
MATT: He can, yeah.

669
00:28:14.758 --> 00:28:15.701
TALIESIN: Just a perception roll?

670
00:28:15.701 --> 00:28:17.824
MATT: Perception check, yes.

671
00:28:17.824 --> 00:28:20.495
TALIESIN: Kill it. Ooh!

672
00:28:20.495 --> 00:28:23.204
27.
MATT: 27, okay.

673
00:28:24.354 --> 00:28:29.345
So do you guys have anything you want to discuss?

674
00:28:29.345 --> 00:28:30.937
TRAVIS: Actually, yeah.

675
00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:36.115
How are you feeling in all this horribleness?

676
00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:39.589
TALIESIN: I'm scared.

677
00:28:39.589 --> 00:28:41.198
TRAVIS: You are?
TALIESIN: Sure.

678
00:28:41.198 --> 00:28:43.099
TRAVIS: You don't feel like a warm embrace

679
00:28:43.099 --> 00:28:47.591
of nature-ly goodness enveloping you second by second?

680
00:28:48.582 --> 00:28:50.529
TALIESIN: Yeah, I feel that too, actually.

681
00:28:50.529 --> 00:28:53.014
TRAVIS: You do?
TALIESIN: That's nice, yeah.

682
00:28:53.014 --> 00:28:54.957
TRAVIS: Cool.
TALIESIN: Are you feeling scared?

683
00:28:54.957 --> 00:28:56.732
TRAVIS: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Good, you should be.

684
00:28:56.732 --> 00:28:58.560
This is terrifying.

685
00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:00.777
TRAVIS: When you say it, it's so much worse.

686
00:29:00.777 --> 00:29:01.610
TALIESIN: I know.

687
00:29:02.799 --> 00:29:05.353
TRAVIS: I've been trying to like focus on, you know,

688
00:29:05.353 --> 00:29:07.793
that warm feeling from the--

689
00:29:07.793 --> 00:29:10.568
TALIESIN: That's a good thing to focus on.

690
00:29:11.555 --> 00:29:15.031
Also we're, I mean what better place

691
00:29:15.031 --> 00:29:18.606
for people filled with warmth

692
00:29:18.606 --> 00:29:19.807
and in the middle of something

693
00:29:19.807 --> 00:29:24.518
that's obviously so corrupted we must be here to do good.

694
00:29:24.518 --> 00:29:26.700
TRAVIS: You're smiling.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

695
00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:29.603
TRAVIS: Do you smile when you're scared?

696
00:29:29.603 --> 00:29:32.207
TALIESIN: Actually, yeah, I do.

697
00:29:32.207 --> 00:29:35.332
I discovered that

698
00:29:35.332 --> 00:29:38.278
a smile and a laugh

699
00:29:38.278 --> 00:29:41.346
is a good way of infuriating your siblings

700
00:29:41.346 --> 00:29:43.369
when they try and scare you.

701
00:29:45.077 --> 00:29:46.429
(laughter)

702
00:29:46.429 --> 00:29:48.366
TRAVIS: I forget, how many siblings did you say you had?

703
00:29:48.366 --> 00:29:50.211
TALIESIN: Quite a few.

704
00:29:50.211 --> 00:29:51.640
TRAVIS: Like, nine?

705
00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:54.318
TALIESIN: Not that many, but no.

706
00:29:54.318 --> 00:29:56.075
Hopefully, if things work out,

707
00:29:56.075 --> 00:29:59.073
maybe one day you'll get to meet some of them.

708
00:29:59.073 --> 00:30:03.662
TRAVIS: What do you make of those whispers?

709
00:30:03.662 --> 00:30:05.320
TALIESIN: Hmm.

710
00:30:06.607 --> 00:30:10.141
Well, maybe it's people who've come before

711
00:30:10.141 --> 00:30:15.141
who are trapped, their essences bound to this place,

712
00:30:15.718 --> 00:30:20.059
desperate to feed off of the energy of the living.

713
00:30:20.059 --> 00:30:24.441
Or trying to warn us away from something that's inside.

714
00:30:24.441 --> 00:30:29.255
Or maybe it's just some jerk casting illusion,

715
00:30:29.255 --> 00:30:30.338
I don't know.

716
00:30:31.592 --> 00:30:34.235
TRAVIS: I like that second option more.

717
00:30:34.235 --> 00:30:36.502
TALIESIN: Well, there's an awful lot of

718
00:30:36.502 --> 00:30:39.419
"Please Go Away" signs on this place.

719
00:30:40.871 --> 00:30:43.168
I'm a little worried that when we get in there

720
00:30:43.168 --> 00:30:45.860
we might find something that we're--

721
00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:48.543
that's trying to get out

722
00:30:49.735 --> 00:30:52.862
and I'm glad that your normal passenger

723
00:30:52.862 --> 00:30:55.921
is not with us for this round.

724
00:30:55.921 --> 00:30:58.603
That would make me a little more nervous than I am.

725
00:30:58.603 --> 00:30:59.870
TRAVIS: It would?

726
00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:04.870
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, I like knowing everybody involved.

727
00:31:05.095 --> 00:31:06.725
TRAVIS: All parties involved.

728
00:31:06.725 --> 00:31:10.717
TALIESIN: Well, we're bringing nature into a cave

729
00:31:10.717 --> 00:31:14.932
and we're bringing illumination and knowledge,

730
00:31:14.932 --> 00:31:17.616
and we are in the company of somebody

731
00:31:17.616 --> 00:31:19.528
who worships the Stormlord,

732
00:31:19.528 --> 00:31:23.067
which I can't imagine is a good god

733
00:31:23.067 --> 00:31:26.058
to bring down into the center of the Earth.

734
00:31:26.058 --> 00:31:27.855
Down below the ground.

735
00:31:27.855 --> 00:31:29.554
TRAVIS: That's true.

736
00:31:29.554 --> 00:31:34.554
TALIESIN: So we have an obligation to protect their charge.

737
00:31:35.176 --> 00:31:37.742
TRAVIS: I hope she continues to let me fight for her.

738
00:31:39.125 --> 00:31:41.157
It's a good feeling.

739
00:31:41.157 --> 00:31:43.792
TALIESIN: It's nice fighting for people.

740
00:31:43.792 --> 00:31:45.521
It's nice fighting for things.

741
00:31:45.521 --> 00:31:46.530
TRAVIS: Yeah.

742
00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:51.530
I was going to say something bigger than, you know.

743
00:31:51.844 --> 00:31:54.344
TALIESIN: It's also good to be scared.

744
00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:57.490
TRAVIS: Well, I got that in spades.

745
00:31:57.490 --> 00:31:59.573
TALIESIN: This is a spooky place.

746
00:32:01.135 --> 00:32:03.302
I listen deep for a voice.

747
00:32:05.898 --> 00:32:07.447
MATT: With your perception check

748
00:32:07.447 --> 00:32:10.887
you don't hear any whispers.

749
00:32:10.887 --> 00:32:15.320
You hear very faintly,

750
00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:17.086
from beyond the ledge

751
00:32:17.086 --> 00:32:19.035
and below the chasm,

752
00:32:19.035 --> 00:32:20.476
movement.

753
00:32:21.968 --> 00:32:26.968
Just a continuous

754
00:32:27.184 --> 00:32:29.160
shifting

755
00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:34.160
and almost like a gelatinous sliding

756
00:32:34.691 --> 00:32:39.291
mixed with friction, mixed with tearing,

757
00:32:39.291 --> 00:32:44.250
just a bit of (wet sounds).

758
00:32:47.684 --> 00:32:51.351
But just very faintly from the chasm below.

759
00:32:52.675 --> 00:32:56.211
TALIESIN: I do not want to go down there.

760
00:32:56.211 --> 00:32:57.527
TRAVIS: Then I don't think we should.

761
00:32:57.527 --> 00:32:58.360
TALIESIN: No.

762
00:32:59.504 --> 00:33:01.617
TRAVIS: Well, at least those voices are gone.

763
00:33:01.617 --> 00:33:03.604
It's nice and quiet now.

764
00:33:03.604 --> 00:33:04.745
TALIESIN: Speaking of nice and quiet,

765
00:33:04.745 --> 00:33:07.256
we should probably wake the others.

766
00:33:07.256 --> 00:33:08.303
TRAVIS: Is it time?

767
00:33:08.303 --> 00:33:10.916
TALIESIN: Yeah, I think it's time.

768
00:33:10.916 --> 00:33:11.916
TRAVIS: All right.

769
00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:16.114
MATT: All right. You guys finish your watch.

770
00:33:16.114 --> 00:33:19.447
Wake up the rest of your party, quietly.

771
00:33:21.704 --> 00:33:24.813
The dome has since vanished after the eight hour period.

772
00:33:24.813 --> 00:33:25.646
SAM: We got a long rest?

773
00:33:25.646 --> 00:33:26.685
MATT: You got a long rest.

774
00:33:26.685 --> 00:33:29.557
SAM: Oh, yes!

775
00:33:29.557 --> 00:33:31.390
LIAM: Confirm, D&amp;D Beyond!

776
00:33:33.969 --> 00:33:36.136
TALIESIN: We're going to want a rope.

777
00:33:37.413 --> 00:33:38.683
MARISHA: I think I have rope.

778
00:33:38.683 --> 00:33:41.476
SAM: Yeah, so, how do we get across this bridge?

779
00:33:41.476 --> 00:33:43.739
ASHLEY: I might have some too, actually.

780
00:33:43.739 --> 00:33:46.234
SAM: We're looking for rope?

781
00:33:46.234 --> 00:33:47.539
TALIESIN: I think we should have some rope

782
00:33:47.539 --> 00:33:49.679
and maybe be tied together.

783
00:33:49.679 --> 00:33:51.132
ASHLEY: I have 50 feet of rope.
MARISHA: Don't we still

784
00:33:51.132 --> 00:33:52.715
have that big rope?

785
00:33:54.342 --> 00:33:55.487
TALIESIN: Everybody's got rope.

786
00:33:55.487 --> 00:33:57.970
That's like the thing that everyone in D&amp;D has.

787
00:33:57.970 --> 00:33:59.688
TRAVIS: Everyone's given 50 foot of rope.

788
00:33:59.688 --> 00:34:01.959
SAM: I do have a grappling hook, though.

789
00:34:01.959 --> 00:34:03.779
LIAM: Every man, woman, and child has 50 feet of rope.

790
00:34:03.779 --> 00:34:05.202
SAM: I have a grappling hook.

791
00:34:05.202 --> 00:34:08.359
MATT: I think they're government issued, actually.

792
00:34:08.359 --> 00:34:10.617
TALIESIN: It's a beautiful baby.
LIAM: While everyone is

793
00:34:10.617 --> 00:34:12.800
sorting through all their things, I'm going to ritual cast,

794
00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:15.482
slap the book down by the edge, by the bridge,

795
00:34:15.482 --> 00:34:17.545
and cast Detect Magic.

796
00:34:17.545 --> 00:34:18.897
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: At the bridge.

797
00:34:18.897 --> 00:34:19.730
MATT: Okay.

798
00:34:21.505 --> 00:34:23.748
As you're taking the time, you end up completing your

799
00:34:23.748 --> 00:34:27.564
ritual. The rest of you are gathering your things.

800
00:34:27.564 --> 00:34:31.180
Nothing magical seems to emanate from the bridge.

801
00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:32.331
Nothing in the vicinity.

802
00:34:32.331 --> 00:34:34.409
Other than the items you guys carry

803
00:34:34.409 --> 00:34:35.391
and the things you'd expect

804
00:34:35.391 --> 00:34:37.148
to find the magical essence from.

805
00:34:37.148 --> 00:34:37.981
LIAM: Yep.

806
00:34:39.689 --> 00:34:40.729
MARISHA: I have rope.

807
00:34:40.729 --> 00:34:42.048
50 feet.

808
00:34:42.048 --> 00:34:46.423
TALIESIN: That chasm looks pretty big.

809
00:34:50.349 --> 00:34:53.341
LIAM: I could always send my cat across

810
00:34:53.341 --> 00:34:56.424
and a vulture sitting on my shoulder.

811
00:34:57.630 --> 00:34:58.736
SAM: Yes, that's a good idea.

812
00:34:58.736 --> 00:35:00.613
TALIESIN: I think that's a great idea, just to scout,

813
00:35:00.613 --> 00:35:02.947
or maybe too, if we have enough rope,

814
00:35:02.947 --> 00:35:05.753
we can try and tie to the other side.

815
00:35:05.753 --> 00:35:07.371
MARISHA: See how far he gets.

816
00:35:07.371 --> 00:35:08.288
Measure it.

817
00:35:10.143 --> 00:35:12.594
TALIESIN: I don't know how much rope a vulture can drag.

818
00:35:12.594 --> 00:35:13.979
SAM: Probably not a lot.

819
00:35:13.979 --> 00:35:17.512
LIAM: It would take time.
He could drag it. He could walk

820
00:35:17.512 --> 00:35:20.182
across, but that seems a little herky jerky.

821
00:35:20.182 --> 00:35:21.630
SAM: Why doesn't he just go look?

822
00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:25.200
LIAM: Yeah, that's easy to start with, certainly.

823
00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:28.963
I will send him to look for another side

824
00:35:28.963 --> 00:35:31.024
and come back in case it's very far.

825
00:35:31.024 --> 00:35:32.192
MATT: You got it.

826
00:35:32.192 --> 00:35:35.403
(wings flapping)

827
00:35:35.403 --> 00:35:39.984
The vulture vanishes into the shadow about 30 feet from you.

828
00:35:39.984 --> 00:35:42.277
As you're focusing, make a perception check for me.

829
00:35:42.277 --> 00:35:44.626
The vulture's perception.

830
00:35:44.626 --> 00:35:46.587
LIAM: Balls balls balls balls balls.

831
00:35:46.587 --> 00:35:47.537
SAM: Balls balls balls?

832
00:35:47.537 --> 00:35:48.834
LIAM: Balls balls balls.

833
00:35:48.834 --> 00:35:51.259
TALIESIN: Vulture balls.
LIAM: Got it.

834
00:35:54.247 --> 00:35:56.942
SAM: Him looking up stats is brought to you by D&amp;D Beyond.

835
00:35:56.942 --> 00:35:59.192
(laughter)

836
00:36:01.561 --> 00:36:04.241
LIAM: It's a very bad roll.

837
00:36:04.241 --> 00:36:05.303
Has advantage on wisdom checks

838
00:36:05.303 --> 00:36:08.386
that rely on sight or smell, oh good.

839
00:36:09.793 --> 00:36:11.828
A little better.

840
00:36:11.828 --> 00:36:14.318
That is 13.

841
00:36:14.318 --> 00:36:15.235
MATT: 13, okay.

842
00:36:16.756 --> 00:36:19.610
You're looking through Frumpkin's eyes?
LIAM: Yeah.

843
00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:20.710
MATT: You go over the bridge

844
00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:22.620
and it's about 10 feet wide

845
00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:25.453
with metal chains along the sides.

846
00:36:27.269 --> 00:36:29.259
It's a fairly sturdy looking bridge.

847
00:36:29.259 --> 00:36:30.905
Not too rickety.

848
00:36:30.905 --> 00:36:32.916
(wings flapping)

849
00:36:32.916 --> 00:36:37.782
Continuing on about 40, 50, 60,

850
00:36:37.782 --> 00:36:39.671
70 feet.

851
00:36:39.671 --> 00:36:41.486
Two shapes appear on the outskirts

852
00:36:41.486 --> 00:36:43.490
about 20 feet from each side.

853
00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:47.659
It looks like these two stalagmites?

854
00:36:47.659 --> 00:36:48.903
LIAM: Yeah, yeah.
MATT: I get so nervous

855
00:36:48.903 --> 00:36:49.903
every time I get close to it,

856
00:36:49.903 --> 00:36:50.807
even though I know it well now,

857
00:36:50.807 --> 00:36:52.050
my brain just fucks up now.

858
00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:53.080
Thanks, Stephen Colbert.

859
00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:53.913
MARISHA: Yeah.

860
00:36:55.801 --> 00:36:56.935
MATT: So.

861
00:36:56.935 --> 00:36:59.515
They rise up from underneath

862
00:36:59.515 --> 00:37:01.652
and they're about maybe 10, 15 feet wide.

863
00:37:01.652 --> 00:37:04.388
These two little platforms at two angles

864
00:37:04.388 --> 00:37:07.419
that have metal cages on them, rusted.

865
00:37:07.419 --> 00:37:09.567
LIAM: These are off on the sides?

866
00:37:09.567 --> 00:37:10.400
MATT: Off on the sides,

867
00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:11.642
about 20 feet from each side of the bridge.

868
00:37:11.642 --> 00:37:14.491
One's closer on the left hand side.

869
00:37:14.491 --> 00:37:16.540
The other's about 30 feet beyond that,

870
00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:17.988
20 feet off that side.

871
00:37:17.988 --> 00:37:20.954
Each have a tall iron cage on them.

872
00:37:20.954 --> 00:37:23.000
LIAM: Like standing on top of them?

873
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.636
MATT: The stalagmites rise up to

874
00:37:25.636 --> 00:37:29.179
about a little precipice about 10, 15 feet across,

875
00:37:29.179 --> 00:37:30.357
and the cage sits on there.

876
00:37:30.357 --> 00:37:33.233
Like a little island in the middle of the open.

877
00:37:33.233 --> 00:37:35.724
SAM: It's fine.
MATT: It's fine.

878
00:37:35.724 --> 00:37:37.486
(wings flapping)

879
00:37:37.486 --> 00:37:42.187
Continues on following the bridge, 100 feet.

880
00:37:42.187 --> 00:37:43.020
120 feet.

881
00:37:45.927 --> 00:37:49.563
Little ways passed that, the other side comes into view.

882
00:37:49.563 --> 00:37:52.639
The bridge curves up and is bolted onto

883
00:37:52.639 --> 00:37:56.699
the outside of some large rocky tower

884
00:37:56.699 --> 00:37:58.811
and you can see an archway

885
00:37:58.811 --> 00:38:02.001
that the bridge just juts right into.

886
00:38:02.001 --> 00:38:03.906
There is no additional platform.

887
00:38:03.906 --> 00:38:05.583
There is no other side of this cliff face.

888
00:38:05.583 --> 00:38:08.263
The bridge just ends, bolted into the side

889
00:38:08.263 --> 00:38:11.187
of this large column, and there is an archway

890
00:38:11.187 --> 00:38:13.136
that opens up where the bridge ends.

891
00:38:13.136 --> 00:38:17.732
LIAM: Caleb has been quietly muttering this to the party.

892
00:38:17.732 --> 00:38:20.620
I summon him.

893
00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:24.594
No, I have him land just in the entryway.

894
00:38:24.594 --> 00:38:27.157
MATT: Okay. (wings flapping, thud)

895
00:38:27.157 --> 00:38:29.980
LIAM: I'll have him maybe three feet in

896
00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:31.492
to have a look around.

897
00:38:31.492 --> 00:38:32.719
MATT: Of the archway?
LIAM: Yeah.

898
00:38:32.719 --> 00:38:34.906
MATT: Okay.

899
00:38:34.906 --> 00:38:37.041
Frumpkin moves through this hallway

900
00:38:37.041 --> 00:38:42.041
that continues on for about 50 or so feet, continued arch.

901
00:38:42.094 --> 00:38:44.027
Then it opens into a chamber, colder.

902
00:38:44.027 --> 00:38:45.525
The temperature drops a bit.

903
00:38:45.525 --> 00:38:50.516
LIAM: Is it natural or is it carved and sculpted?

904
00:38:50.516 --> 00:38:52.225
MATT: The hallway?
LIAM: Yeah.

905
00:38:52.225 --> 00:38:55.623
MATT: Looks to be carved and sculpted.

906
00:38:55.623 --> 00:38:59.676
LIAM: And nothing, I see nothing in here?

907
00:38:59.676 --> 00:39:01.079
MATT: Just a hallway.
LIAM: Okay.

908
00:39:01.079 --> 00:39:02.245
Then I quickly, because I don't want

909
00:39:02.245 --> 00:39:03.103
to keep everyone waiting,

910
00:39:03.103 --> 00:39:04.730
I have him come back,

911
00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:08.512
but I have him land on top of one of the cages

912
00:39:08.512 --> 00:39:11.665
and look inside and see if there is anything in the cage.

913
00:39:11.665 --> 00:39:13.432
MATT: There is a skeleton.

914
00:39:13.432 --> 00:39:15.212
There is a corpse.

915
00:39:15.212 --> 00:39:16.637
Armored, dusty,

916
00:39:17.988 --> 00:39:22.515
just long dead, placed in there for some form of punishment,

917
00:39:22.515 --> 00:39:23.348
who knows.

918
00:39:23.348 --> 00:39:24.336
TRAVIS: Bone and armor?

919
00:39:24.336 --> 00:39:25.737
MATT: Bone and armor.

920
00:39:27.932 --> 00:39:30.684
LIAM: I summon him back.

921
00:39:30.684 --> 00:39:34.258
I have said everything to you as it happened.

922
00:39:34.258 --> 00:39:37.566
MARISHA: Do we have 150 some odd feet of rope?

923
00:39:37.566 --> 00:39:40.724
TALIESIN: Perhaps a better idea-- well, I don't know,

924
00:39:40.724 --> 00:39:42.324
considering if we don't have that,

925
00:39:42.324 --> 00:39:44.699
is just making sure we're all tied together

926
00:39:44.699 --> 00:39:49.524
so if one person drops we all can hold onto them.

927
00:39:51.435 --> 00:39:52.426
SAM: Okay.

928
00:39:52.426 --> 00:39:55.630
I mean, if you or Yasha drop, that's pretty heavy.

929
00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:58.264
TALIESIN: Sure, but you'll have a lot of people.

930
00:39:58.264 --> 00:40:00.968
There's a whole bunch of people who can take care of that.

931
00:40:00.968 --> 00:40:03.717
ASHLEY: Maybe you and I should take a front and a back?

932
00:40:03.717 --> 00:40:05.391
I can take the front.
SAM: That's a good idea.

933
00:40:05.391 --> 00:40:07.483
TRAVIS: I have 50 feet of rope.

934
00:40:07.483 --> 00:40:10.391
TALIESIN: Or the biggest people maybe in the middle

935
00:40:10.391 --> 00:40:11.542
and then the lighter people,

936
00:40:11.542 --> 00:40:14.010
so if the lighter people go over we can--

937
00:40:14.010 --> 00:40:15.926
SAM: Okay.
TALIESIN: I don't know.

938
00:40:15.926 --> 00:40:17.736
Actually, that doesn't make any.

939
00:40:17.736 --> 00:40:19.337
Wait, does it make sense?
SAM: None of it makes sense.

940
00:40:19.337 --> 00:40:21.942
I think if a heavy person falls it's going to be heavy,

941
00:40:21.942 --> 00:40:25.048
regardless of where they are.

942
00:40:25.048 --> 00:40:27.292
TALIESIN: I mean, the lighter--

943
00:40:27.292 --> 00:40:29.773
MARISHA: If it breaks behind us or in front of us.

944
00:40:29.773 --> 00:40:32.758
TALIESIN: Is that... I don't know.

945
00:40:32.758 --> 00:40:33.591
MARISHA: I don't know,

946
00:40:33.591 --> 00:40:35.016
I'm just conjecturing.
ASHLEY: There's probably some physics to this,

947
00:40:35.016 --> 00:40:36.264
but I can't think of it right now.

948
00:40:36.264 --> 00:40:38.164
SAM: Caleb will know.

949
00:40:39.656 --> 00:40:42.389
LIAM: I was thinking about magic. What did you say?

950
00:40:42.389 --> 00:40:43.222
SAM: Nothing.

951
00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:46.097
Let's tie ourselves together

952
00:40:46.097 --> 00:40:47.642
and go across.

953
00:40:47.642 --> 00:40:49.424
TRAVIS: Have we touched the chains yet,

954
00:40:49.424 --> 00:40:52.275
like the actual bridge yet?

955
00:40:52.275 --> 00:40:54.122
Should we try that first just to make sure it's not

956
00:40:54.122 --> 00:40:56.195
(gargled yelling) as soon as you touch it?

957
00:40:56.195 --> 00:40:57.122
SAM: Go ahead.

958
00:40:57.122 --> 00:40:58.581
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll walk up and--

959
00:40:58.581 --> 00:41:00.305
will somebody hold my damn hand?

960
00:41:00.305 --> 00:41:01.788
TALIESIN: I can do it if you--

961
00:41:01.788 --> 00:41:03.911
ASHLEY: Jester will probably hold your hand.

962
00:41:03.911 --> 00:41:05.957
MARISHA: Aw.
TRAVIS: Jester, hold my hand.

963
00:41:05.957 --> 00:41:07.716
(laughter)

964
00:41:07.716 --> 00:41:09.886
MATT: All right, I need you to...

965
00:41:09.886 --> 00:41:13.850
not do anything.
TRAVIS: Ah, you fucking bitch.

966
00:41:13.850 --> 00:41:15.204
MATT: It's cold metal.

967
00:41:15.204 --> 00:41:16.810
Fingers go around.

968
00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:18.450
No issue.

969
00:41:18.450 --> 00:41:19.849
TRAVIS: Cold metal, we're good.

970
00:41:19.849 --> 00:41:21.098
TALIESIN: It's that bridge on

971
00:41:21.098 --> 00:41:24.064
Tom Sawyer's island in Disneyland.

972
00:41:24.064 --> 00:41:25.575
TRAVIS: Is it wooden planks?

973
00:41:25.575 --> 00:41:27.628
MATT: No, metal.

974
00:41:27.628 --> 00:41:29.278
SAM: Metal planks?
MATT: Yep.

975
00:41:29.278 --> 00:41:30.408
TRAVIS and SAM: Or chain?

976
00:41:30.408 --> 00:41:33.758
MATT: No, there's chain railing on each side

977
00:41:33.758 --> 00:41:36.819
with individual chains every two or so feet

978
00:41:36.819 --> 00:41:40.366
in-between that go down to these metal planks

979
00:41:40.366 --> 00:41:41.722
that go across the bridge.

980
00:41:41.722 --> 00:41:42.997
SAM: Got it.

981
00:41:42.997 --> 00:41:46.061
LIAM: DM, how far-- you said 20ish feet away from the bridge

982
00:41:46.061 --> 00:41:48.101
are those two cages?

983
00:41:48.101 --> 00:41:49.943
MATT: About halfway down, now that Frumpkin's made the

984
00:41:49.943 --> 00:41:52.534
pathway, about at a halfway point, roughly.

985
00:41:52.534 --> 00:41:55.215
There's two of these, one on one side, one on the other,

986
00:41:55.215 --> 00:41:58.371
both about 20 feet from the bridge's edge.

987
00:41:58.371 --> 00:42:01.143
LIAM: Okay, so we're roping our way onto this?

988
00:42:01.143 --> 00:42:02.707
TALIESIN: I think we should, at the very least,

989
00:42:02.707 --> 00:42:03.963
be all tied together.

990
00:42:03.963 --> 00:42:05.435
TRAVIS: Do the metal planks look smooth?

991
00:42:05.435 --> 00:42:07.209
There's no pebbles or debris on them

992
00:42:07.209 --> 00:42:09.759
that would shake loose?
MATT: Make a perception check.

993
00:42:12.818 --> 00:42:14.308
TRAVIS: Five.
TALIESIN: You might want to

994
00:42:14.308 --> 00:42:16.087
check for traps.
MATT: Five?

995
00:42:16.087 --> 00:42:17.292
Okay.

996
00:42:17.292 --> 00:42:19.107
The chain edge, by the way,

997
00:42:19.107 --> 00:42:22.156
is about waist high, a little lower.

998
00:42:22.156 --> 00:42:25.939
So it's not like a full giant chain. It's fairly low.

999
00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:29.324
But it can be used if you

1000
00:42:29.324 --> 00:42:31.992
bend down and, depending on your size.

1001
00:42:31.992 --> 00:42:34.161
For you it's pretty sturdy.

1002
00:42:34.161 --> 00:42:35.369
SAM: Great.

1003
00:42:35.369 --> 00:42:36.494
MATT: For Caduceus, for instance,

1004
00:42:36.494 --> 00:42:38.991
it's just above knee height.

1005
00:42:38.991 --> 00:42:41.741
MARISHA: Oh my god, that's terrifying!

1006
00:42:41.741 --> 00:42:42.811
LIAM: That's terrible.

1007
00:42:42.811 --> 00:42:45.770
TRAVIS: It's like safety rails in Europe.

1008
00:42:47.489 --> 00:42:52.489
LIAM: Would you like to be smaller as you cross?

1009
00:42:53.105 --> 00:42:54.011
TALIESIN: I mean...

1010
00:42:54.011 --> 00:42:55.877
LIAM: Do you think that's--?
SAM: But no,

1011
00:42:55.877 --> 00:42:58.253
that will make him weaker, right?

1012
00:42:58.253 --> 00:43:00.294
TALIESIN: No.
SAM: You are a little slower?

1013
00:43:00.294 --> 00:43:02.419
LIAM: Well, a little bit. Not slower, but a little bit--

1014
00:43:02.419 --> 00:43:04.882
but also not-

1015
00:43:04.882 --> 00:43:07.748
less likely to teeter off.

1016
00:43:07.748 --> 00:43:11.460
TALIESIN: I mean, if you think that's a good idea,

1017
00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:12.903
I don't know.

1018
00:43:12.903 --> 00:43:15.416
LIAM: I do.
TALIESIN: I'm not opposed.

1019
00:43:15.416 --> 00:43:17.705
LIAM: It seems like a bad--

1020
00:43:17.705 --> 00:43:20.171
you're very top heavy on top of this thing that's just--

1021
00:43:20.171 --> 00:43:21.771
TALIESIN: That's fair.

1022
00:43:21.771 --> 00:43:23.165
LIAM: We don't want to lose you.

1023
00:43:23.165 --> 00:43:25.502
TALIESIN: Yeah, either that or I was going to crawl,

1024
00:43:25.502 --> 00:43:27.878
but I don't know how quiet we're going to be.

1025
00:43:27.878 --> 00:43:29.424
I also can't see without light,

1026
00:43:29.424 --> 00:43:31.202
so that's going to be exciting as well.

1027
00:43:31.202 --> 00:43:32.728
LIAM: Can you tell if this is going to drop

1028
00:43:32.728 --> 00:43:34.416
the second we step on it, or--?

1029
00:43:34.416 --> 00:43:36.932
MATT: Technically, both Caleb and Caduceus

1030
00:43:36.932 --> 00:43:37.990
cannot see at all.

1031
00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:41.586
There is no light source. You guys are blind in here.

1032
00:43:41.586 --> 00:43:43.046
TRAVIS: Is this conversation stirring

1033
00:43:43.046 --> 00:43:46.879
the same sort of reaction it did last night?

1034
00:43:46.879 --> 00:43:50.064
MATT: I think, I imagine you guys are being fairly quiet,

1035
00:43:50.064 --> 00:43:51.928
so so far, not happening.

1036
00:43:51.928 --> 00:43:53.464
Nothing, no response.

1037
00:43:53.464 --> 00:43:56.326
LIAM: I think I will bring up, then, the Dancing Lights.

1038
00:43:56.326 --> 00:43:59.201
Let them just float around us.

1039
00:43:59.201 --> 00:44:00.873
MATT: What's the radius on those?

1040
00:44:00.873 --> 00:44:03.035
LIAM: Uh, zuhbuh zuhbuh zuhbuh.

1041
00:44:03.035 --> 00:44:04.210
That's the answer.

1042
00:44:04.210 --> 00:44:07.743
SAM: One other thing that we could do, you know,

1043
00:44:07.743 --> 00:44:12.522
is, Jester, you have that door spell

1044
00:44:12.522 --> 00:44:14.768
where you can just be on the other side

1045
00:44:14.768 --> 00:44:17.941
of the bridge whenever you want.

1046
00:44:17.941 --> 00:44:18.916
So maybe you could--

1047
00:44:18.916 --> 00:44:20.592
TRAVIS: (as Jester) Oh yes, that's true.

1048
00:44:20.592 --> 00:44:25.592
SAM: Maybe you and one other person of your size

1049
00:44:25.595 --> 00:44:29.528
could stay behind in case anything went wrong?

1050
00:44:30.526 --> 00:44:33.460
You know, then you and that one other person,

1051
00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:36.078
maybe me, I'm just throwing it out there,

1052
00:44:36.078 --> 00:44:38.078
could just be ready in case anything happens

1053
00:44:38.078 --> 00:44:40.546
to the rest of you and not there

1054
00:44:40.546 --> 00:44:42.329
when it happens to the rest of you?

1055
00:44:42.329 --> 00:44:43.591
TRAVIS: Are you saying you want to go with Jester?

1056
00:44:43.591 --> 00:44:45.273
SAM: Yeah, I could just maybe stay behind with Jester,

1057
00:44:45.273 --> 00:44:48.098
maybe, and while you guys just do the thing

1058
00:44:48.098 --> 00:44:50.653
and then Jester and I can just poof over later

1059
00:44:50.653 --> 00:44:52.779
with the Dimension Door thing.

1060
00:44:52.779 --> 00:44:53.704
TRAVIS: Aren't you the one that's good

1061
00:44:53.704 --> 00:44:55.253
at checking for traps?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1062
00:44:55.253 --> 00:44:56.911
SAM: I mean, it's real dark.

1063
00:44:56.911 --> 00:44:58.534
(laughter)

1064
00:44:58.534 --> 00:45:00.753
TRAVIS: You have darkvision!

1065
00:45:00.753 --> 00:45:01.987
SAM: It's gray, though.

1066
00:45:01.987 --> 00:45:03.674
(laughter)

1067
00:45:03.674 --> 00:45:04.797
LIAM: Without even saying anything,

1068
00:45:04.797 --> 00:45:06.787
I just send one of them to-- the globules

1069
00:45:06.787 --> 00:45:08.925
to slowly rotate around Nott's head.

1070
00:45:08.925 --> 00:45:10.297
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

1071
00:45:10.297 --> 00:45:12.123
TRAVIS: Is that better?

1072
00:45:12.123 --> 00:45:13.689
SAM: A little bit.

1073
00:45:13.689 --> 00:45:15.890
TRAVIS: So thank you for volunteering for going first.

1074
00:45:15.890 --> 00:45:17.152
SAM: I don't want to go first.

1075
00:45:17.152 --> 00:45:18.685
That sounds terrible.

1076
00:45:18.685 --> 00:45:21.554
Something bad is going to-- this is a terrible thing!

1077
00:45:21.554 --> 00:45:23.313
I don't want to go out there. No!

1078
00:45:23.313 --> 00:45:26.765
TALIESIN: If Yasha goes next, then if you have to fall

1079
00:45:26.765 --> 00:45:28.704
then you'll have someone strong holding on.

1080
00:45:28.704 --> 00:45:30.830
ASHLEY: You're definitely safe.
TALIESIN: Then you'll be fine.

1081
00:45:30.830 --> 00:45:32.243
MARISHA: I can be right behind you.

1082
00:45:32.243 --> 00:45:34.265
That way I can like, quickly, you know?

1083
00:45:34.265 --> 00:45:38.265
SAM: You wouldn't toss me off a bridge or anything?

1084
00:45:39.224 --> 00:45:41.032
ASHLEY: Kill your whole--
SAM: Nope!

1085
00:45:41.032 --> 00:45:44.225
ASHLEY: -- hopes and dreams of...?
SAM: Nope!

1086
00:45:44.225 --> 00:45:46.808
ASHLEY: No, I would never do that, Nott.

1087
00:45:48.011 --> 00:45:49.011
SAM: If I must.

1088
00:45:50.678 --> 00:45:52.696
(crying)

1089
00:45:52.696 --> 00:45:54.203
MARISHA: Are we tying ourselves together?

1090
00:45:54.203 --> 00:45:56.098
TRAVIS: Yeah, 50 feet of rope.

1091
00:45:56.098 --> 00:45:58.389
ASHLEY: We do not talk when we cross the bridge,

1092
00:45:58.389 --> 00:45:59.789
if we can help it.

1093
00:45:59.789 --> 00:46:01.061
MATT: 50 feet between each of you?

1094
00:46:01.061 --> 00:46:02.775
TRAVIS: No, so 50 feet--

1095
00:46:02.775 --> 00:46:05.047
MATT: So how much slack is there between each of you?

1096
00:46:05.047 --> 00:46:07.018
And in what order?

1097
00:46:07.018 --> 00:46:08.268
TALIESIN: Let me think.

1098
00:46:09.435 --> 00:46:11.151
SAM: 50 feet divided by six.

1099
00:46:11.151 --> 00:46:13.535
MARISHA: I also have rope, if we wanted to do more.

1100
00:46:13.535 --> 00:46:14.751
SAM: We need some to tie around our waists.

1101
00:46:14.751 --> 00:46:16.909
Probably only six feet-- huh?

1102
00:46:16.909 --> 00:46:18.293
LIAM: We've all got a rope.

1103
00:46:18.293 --> 00:46:20.409
TALIESIN: Almost all of us.

1104
00:46:20.409 --> 00:46:22.149
SAM: Okay, so, we can do as much as we want.

1105
00:46:22.149 --> 00:46:23.445
15 feet sounds good.

1106
00:46:23.445 --> 00:46:24.957
MATT: 15 feet between each?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1107
00:46:24.957 --> 00:46:26.825
MATT: All right, what's the order?

1108
00:46:26.825 --> 00:46:28.205
SAM: I guess me.

1109
00:46:28.205 --> 00:46:29.648
TALIESIN: Checking for traps.
TRAVIS: Yasha.

1110
00:46:29.648 --> 00:46:30.656
ASHLEY: I'll go next.

1111
00:46:30.656 --> 00:46:32.114
MATT: We have Nott.

1112
00:46:32.114 --> 00:46:33.390
Yasha.

1113
00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:35.088
LIAM: I'll be behind Beauregard.

1114
00:46:35.088 --> 00:46:37.066
So I can keep globules going out.

1115
00:46:37.066 --> 00:46:38.451
TALIESIN: And I'll go behind,

1116
00:46:38.451 --> 00:46:40.217
I'll go behind you.
LIAM: Yeah, okay.

1117
00:46:40.217 --> 00:46:41.893
SAM: Before we go.

1118
00:46:41.893 --> 00:46:42.735
MATT: Fjord and Jester in the back?

1119
00:46:42.735 --> 00:46:43.568
TALIESIN: Yeah, sure.

1120
00:46:43.568 --> 00:46:46.645
SAM: You don't happen to have any of that, uh, you know?

1121
00:46:46.645 --> 00:46:48.601
TRAVIS: Jester and I have bamfing abilities.

1122
00:46:48.601 --> 00:46:50.518
Should we be out front?

1123
00:46:51.494 --> 00:46:53.269
TALIESIN: You can bamf with people?
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

1124
00:46:53.269 --> 00:46:54.203
MARISHA: You want the suude?

1125
00:46:54.203 --> 00:46:56.436
SAM: Yeah, do you have some suude?

1126
00:46:56.436 --> 00:46:59.099
TRAVIS: One of us should be up near the front.

1127
00:46:59.099 --> 00:47:01.739
TRAVIS: Let's move Jester up front so that

1128
00:47:01.739 --> 00:47:03.163
we can split up the clerics.

1129
00:47:03.163 --> 00:47:04.205
TRAVIS: Okay.

1130
00:47:04.205 --> 00:47:07.705
TALIESIN: We'll put Jester between Yasha and Beau.

1131
00:47:08.712 --> 00:47:10.998
TRAVIS: What the fuck.
SAM: What the fuck is this?

1132
00:47:10.998 --> 00:47:12.249
TALIESIN: No.

1133
00:47:12.249 --> 00:47:13.388
MATT: This is--

1134
00:47:13.388 --> 00:47:15.724
SAM: Wait, are we going to battle cam?

1135
00:47:15.724 --> 00:47:16.724
If we are.

1136
00:47:17.637 --> 00:47:19.283
MATT: Oh my god!

1137
00:47:19.283 --> 00:47:21.133
Where the hell'd you get that?!

1138
00:47:21.133 --> 00:47:22.778
MARISHA: Yes, 2.0!

1139
00:47:22.778 --> 00:47:23.981
SAM: They sent it to me.

1140
00:47:23.981 --> 00:47:24.959
Dwarven Forge.

1141
00:47:24.959 --> 00:47:29.578
This combat camera is powered by Dwarven Forge.

1142
00:47:29.578 --> 00:47:33.453
The Hellscape Kickstarter campaign is live now.

1143
00:47:34.372 --> 00:47:37.539
It's full of illuminated magma rivers.

1144
00:47:38.604 --> 00:47:40.694
The campaign ends July 1st.

1145
00:47:40.694 --> 00:47:42.677
Go to Critical Role--

1146
00:47:42.677 --> 00:47:44.688
TRAVIS: That helmet's dope, man.

1147
00:47:44.688 --> 00:47:46.646
SAM: They made me a helmet!

1148
00:47:46.646 --> 00:47:48.149
MATT: That's kind of amazing.

1149
00:47:48.149 --> 00:47:49.922
Much cooler than he is. All righty.

1150
00:47:49.922 --> 00:47:51.641
TALIESIN: Ow.
MATT: Sorry.

1151
00:47:51.641 --> 00:47:52.891
TALIESIN: That's fancy.

1152
00:47:54.128 --> 00:47:56.434
TRAVIS: We're going to move Jester up front.

1153
00:47:56.434 --> 00:47:58.658
TRAVIS: Maybe behind--
SAM: Jester's up front?

1154
00:47:58.658 --> 00:48:00.561
TRAVIS: Maybe behind Yasha?
TALIESIN: Oh yeah,

1155
00:48:00.561 --> 00:48:01.731
between Yasha and Beau.

1156
00:48:01.731 --> 00:48:04.525
TRAVIS: So she and I can both bamf with somebody.

1157
00:48:04.525 --> 00:48:05.988
MATT: And you guys are tying 15 feet between each other?

1158
00:48:05.988 --> 00:48:08.404
TALIESIN: So we can make it that much room between us.

1159
00:48:08.404 --> 00:48:09.705
LIAM: I also, before we head out,

1160
00:48:09.705 --> 00:48:13.434
weave a little bit of geometric patterns in front of Yasha

1161
00:48:13.434 --> 00:48:16.476
and I give you the Gift of Alacrity again.

1162
00:48:16.476 --> 00:48:17.827
ASHLEY: Oh!

1163
00:48:17.827 --> 00:48:20.942
LIAM: You see some mathematical patterns for a moment

1164
00:48:20.942 --> 00:48:21.966
and they're gone.

1165
00:48:21.966 --> 00:48:24.870
ASHLEY: I don't understand what this means, okay.

1166
00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:27.943
TALIESIN: 15, then that way we have a little bit of--

1167
00:48:27.943 --> 00:48:29.907
so that you can move.

1168
00:48:29.907 --> 00:48:32.668
ASHLEY: That was increased initiative?
LIAM: Initiative.

1169
00:48:32.668 --> 00:48:34.266
TALIESIN: Three squares as opposed to two,

1170
00:48:34.266 --> 00:48:35.944
but we don't have to stay three squares away.

1171
00:48:35.944 --> 00:48:37.111
MATT: Correct, so.

1172
00:48:38.688 --> 00:48:41.271
MARISHA: I think this train is moving.
MATT: You begin the journey across?

1173
00:48:42.292 --> 00:48:44.133
MARISHA: We'll talk later. Go.

1174
00:48:44.133 --> 00:48:45.165
SAM: Fine.

1175
00:48:45.165 --> 00:48:47.450
No, I mean I can't-- ah shit!

1176
00:48:47.450 --> 00:48:49.751
MATT: Are you going straight across?

1177
00:48:49.751 --> 00:48:52.370
Are you going stealthily? Are you going quickly?

1178
00:48:52.370 --> 00:48:53.246
What's your plan?

1179
00:48:53.246 --> 00:48:56.231
TALIESIN: I think stealthily and quietly

1180
00:48:56.231 --> 00:48:58.108
trying not to disturb or make sound

1181
00:48:58.108 --> 00:49:01.391
on the clinking chains and metal plates.

1182
00:49:01.391 --> 00:49:04.558
TALIESIN: I'm also--
ASHLEY: Clang clang clang clang.

1183
00:49:05.928 --> 00:49:09.987
I'm glad someone is missing from this party today.

1184
00:49:09.987 --> 00:49:12.724
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to cast Protection

1185
00:49:12.724 --> 00:49:15.006
from Good and Evil on myself, too.

1186
00:49:15.006 --> 00:49:19.711
LIAM: Oh, and Mage Armor, and the globules will stretch out

1187
00:49:19.711 --> 00:49:22.576
across the line of us like little dim Christmas lights.

1188
00:49:22.576 --> 00:49:23.458
MATT: You've got it.

1189
00:49:23.458 --> 00:49:25.555
Each orb only gives out about five feet of light.

1190
00:49:25.555 --> 00:49:27.937
Once again, these shadows of this region

1191
00:49:27.937 --> 00:49:30.925
you've found yourself in choking off all light sources

1192
00:49:30.925 --> 00:49:33.359
and visual ranges by about half.

1193
00:49:33.359 --> 00:49:37.392
So going to the first burst of movement.

1194
00:49:37.392 --> 00:49:40.469
That's half speed, and since you're all attached together,

1195
00:49:40.469 --> 00:49:43.665
half speed for the lowest speed of the group.

1196
00:49:43.665 --> 00:49:45.344
Which is 30.
SAM: 30 feet?

1197
00:49:45.344 --> 00:49:47.585
MATT: So 15 feet of movement.

1198
00:49:47.585 --> 00:49:49.013
If you're just moving forward,

1199
00:49:49.013 --> 00:49:52.448
that means you can move 30 feet in a round, stealthily.

1200
00:49:52.448 --> 00:49:55.071
That's all you're doing.

1201
00:49:55.071 --> 00:49:55.905
So.

1202
00:49:55.905 --> 00:49:57.797
TALIESIN: Do we have Pass Without a Trace going?

1203
00:49:59.458 --> 00:50:00.653
MATT: There's Nott.

1204
00:50:00.653 --> 00:50:02.389
TRAVIS: Who has Pass Without a Trace? Is that Jester?

1205
00:50:02.389 --> 00:50:03.495
TALIESIN: That's a Jester.

1206
00:50:03.495 --> 00:50:05.405
MATT: You want 15 feet, 10 feet between each other?

1207
00:50:05.405 --> 00:50:07.297
TALIESIN: No, we just want the option.

1208
00:50:07.297 --> 00:50:09.122
TRAVIS: I think Jester would want to cast

1209
00:50:09.122 --> 00:50:10.755
Pass Without a Trace.
TALIESIN: We have the option of 15 feet,

1210
00:50:10.755 --> 00:50:11.730
but we can--

1211
00:50:11.730 --> 00:50:13.147
SAM: Oh, I see.

1212
00:50:13.147 --> 00:50:14.714
We have 15 feet of slack,

1213
00:50:14.714 --> 00:50:16.611
but we're bunched up now for some reason.

1214
00:50:16.611 --> 00:50:18.758
TALIESIN: I mean, we can open up a bit, but this is,

1215
00:50:18.758 --> 00:50:20.640
you know, take care of each other.

1216
00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:21.700
MATT: All right.

1217
00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:23.865
TRAVIS: Jester's going to cast Pass Without a Trace.

1218
00:50:23.865 --> 00:50:26.136
MATT: You got it.
TALIESIN: Bless you.

1219
00:50:26.136 --> 00:50:26.969
MATT: So.

1220
00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:29.248
I would like everyone to go ahead

1221
00:50:29.248 --> 00:50:30.748
and make stealth checks, please.

1222
00:50:35.876 --> 00:50:37.839
LIAM: Hey! Colville die.

1223
00:50:37.839 --> 00:50:40.023
Come on, Colville.

1224
00:50:40.023 --> 00:50:41.231
TALIESIN: That's okay.
LIAM: Damn it, Colville.

1225
00:50:41.231 --> 00:50:43.590
TALIESIN: We're adding 10 to...

1226
00:50:43.590 --> 00:50:44.423
MATT: Correct.

1227
00:50:46.769 --> 00:50:47.602
Fjord?

1228
00:50:47.602 --> 00:50:48.601
TRAVIS: Yep?

1229
00:50:48.601 --> 00:50:50.576
MATT: What'd you roll?

1230
00:50:50.576 --> 00:50:51.409
TRAVIS: 25.

1231
00:50:52.822 --> 00:50:54.916
Jester rolled 23.

1232
00:50:54.916 --> 00:50:57.415
MARISHA: 28.
LIAM: 13.

1233
00:50:57.415 --> 00:50:58.654
MATT: 13.

1234
00:50:58.654 --> 00:51:00.902
SAM: 35, right? Is Pass Without a Trace--?

1235
00:51:00.902 --> 00:51:03.485
TALIESIN: 24.
ASHLEY: 24.

1236
00:51:03.485 --> 00:51:04.318
MATT: Okay.

1237
00:51:05.326 --> 00:51:08.233
You all slowly begin to traverse.

1238
00:51:08.233 --> 00:51:09.079
LIAM: Rolled a three.

1239
00:51:09.079 --> 00:51:10.551
TALIESIN: ♪ Doot doo, do-doot doot.

1240
00:51:12.001 --> 00:51:13.151
ASHLEY: ♪ (sings Mahna Mahna) ♪

1241
00:51:13.151 --> 00:51:15.401
Oh, no.
TALIESIN: We could do that one, too.

1242
00:51:17.772 --> 00:51:19.071
LIAM: Ah, yes.

1243
00:51:19.071 --> 00:51:20.354
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

1244
00:51:20.354 --> 00:51:22.604
TALIESIN: I don't like any of this.

1245
00:51:26.602 --> 00:51:28.019
MATT: The next 30 feet.

1246
00:51:30.793 --> 00:51:33.001
SAM: Yasha, you want to go in front of me?

1247
00:51:33.001 --> 00:51:34.494
ASHLEY: Nott, I've got you.

1248
00:51:34.494 --> 00:51:35.526
I think you have to go first,

1249
00:51:35.526 --> 00:51:37.008
because you have to see if there are any traps.

1250
00:51:37.008 --> 00:51:40.187
I promise you, if you fall off or anything happens to you--

1251
00:51:40.187 --> 00:51:43.559
SAM: Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

1252
00:51:43.559 --> 00:51:45.892
Let's stop talking, I guess.

1253
00:51:48.415 --> 00:51:49.748
MATT: So.

1254
00:51:49.748 --> 00:51:51.048
Everyone roll stealth again.

1255
00:51:54.329 --> 00:51:58.391
With Nott and Yasha with disadvantage.

1256
00:51:58.391 --> 00:51:59.672
SAM: Disadvantage?
MATT: Correct.

1257
00:51:59.672 --> 00:52:01.749
ASHLEY: Do we still have the plus 10?
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

1258
00:52:01.749 --> 00:52:05.795
TRAVIS: Yasha, or sorry, Jester rolled a 29.

1259
00:52:05.795 --> 00:52:08.234
Fjord rolled a 25.

1260
00:52:08.234 --> 00:52:10.359
MATT: All right.
MARISHA: 23.

1261
00:52:10.359 --> 00:52:12.658
LIAM: 22.
SAM: 26.

1262
00:52:12.658 --> 00:52:14.629
TALIESIN: Uh, natural 20, so that's 31.

1263
00:52:14.629 --> 00:52:16.421
SAM: Whoa.
ASHLEY: 19.

1264
00:52:16.421 --> 00:52:18.217
That's my low number.

1265
00:52:18.217 --> 00:52:19.351
MATT: All right, so.

1266
00:52:19.351 --> 00:52:21.178
So far you have guys have been very careful,

1267
00:52:21.178 --> 00:52:23.180
keeping towards the middle of the bridge.

1268
00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:25.630
It does sway a bit as your weight begins to shift

1269
00:52:25.630 --> 00:52:29.108
from area to area. The chains rattle

1270
00:52:29.108 --> 00:52:30.647
just ever so slightly with the movement,

1271
00:52:30.647 --> 00:52:33.510
but you all maintain a very still,

1272
00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:35.772
careful, meticulous advance.

1273
00:52:35.772 --> 00:52:37.619
You are that far out on the bridge.

1274
00:52:37.619 --> 00:52:38.452
Is there something you wanted to do, Nott,

1275
00:52:38.452 --> 00:52:39.285
or are you guys--

1276
00:52:39.285 --> 00:52:42.190
SAM: No, I-- Do I--

1277
00:52:42.190 --> 00:52:44.989
(loud whisper) Should I be checking for traps?

1278
00:52:44.989 --> 00:52:46.542
I'll check for traps.
TRAVIS: Yes!

1279
00:52:46.542 --> 00:52:49.497
SAM: Which I think will slow us down, probably.

1280
00:52:49.497 --> 00:52:51.065
MATT: A little bit, yes.

1281
00:52:51.065 --> 00:52:52.148
You're checking for traps, then?

1282
00:52:52.148 --> 00:52:53.131
SAM: I'll check for traps in

1283
00:52:53.131 --> 00:52:55.011
this length of the chaining fence.

1284
00:52:55.011 --> 00:52:57.132
MATT: Okay, so we'll put you back about ten feet or so,

1285
00:52:57.132 --> 00:52:58.476
as you slow the progression there.

1286
00:52:58.476 --> 00:53:00.618
LIAM: Is Caduceus crawling?

1287
00:53:00.618 --> 00:53:02.037
TALIESIN: Hm?
LIAM: Is Caduceus crawling?

1288
00:53:02.037 --> 00:53:05.552
TALIESIN: No, he's doing the squat.

1289
00:53:05.552 --> 00:53:06.756
MATT: Check for traps?

1290
00:53:07.689 --> 00:53:10.130
TALIESIN: Squat walk.
SAM: Not great.

1291
00:53:10.130 --> 00:53:12.680
13.
MATT: 13, okay.

1292
00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:13.513
Seems safe.

1293
00:53:14.763 --> 00:53:15.811
SAM: (whimpering)

1294
00:53:16.978 --> 00:53:18.861
MATT: Can everyone make stealth check for the next batch?

1295
00:53:23.471 --> 00:53:25.632
SAM: Am I still at disadvantage or am I back to--

1296
00:53:25.632 --> 00:53:26.817
MATT: No, just normal.

1297
00:53:26.817 --> 00:53:28.684
LIAM: Damn it.
TALIESIN: Ew.

1298
00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:32.167
TRAVIS: 21 for Fjord.

1299
00:53:32.167 --> 00:53:33.475
LIAM: Where are you, Vax?

1300
00:53:34.806 --> 00:53:36.014
TRAVIS: 30 for Jester.

1301
00:53:36.014 --> 00:53:37.372
MATT: All right.
MARISHA: Dead.

1302
00:53:37.372 --> 00:53:39.370
34.
LIAM: 15.

1303
00:53:39.370 --> 00:53:41.506
SAM: 31.
TALIESIN: 17.

1304
00:53:41.506 --> 00:53:42.339
ASHLEY: 25.

1305
00:53:42.339 --> 00:53:44.435
SAM: Man, that Pass Without a Trace is great.

1306
00:53:44.435 --> 00:53:45.988
MATT: It's saving your ass right now.

1307
00:53:45.988 --> 00:53:49.095
All right, so even with you slowly checking traps,

1308
00:53:49.095 --> 00:53:51.371
moving across, you all keeping the line,

1309
00:53:51.371 --> 00:53:54.133
making sure the rope is taut, the knots are strong,

1310
00:53:54.133 --> 00:53:55.913
push forward another 20 or so feet.

1311
00:53:55.913 --> 00:53:57.967
TRAVIS: Jester's going to cast Bless on Caleb

1312
00:53:57.967 --> 00:53:59.433
to give him advantage on stealth.

1313
00:53:59.433 --> 00:54:02.054
TALIESIN: You can do two more Blesses off of the same--

1314
00:54:02.054 --> 00:54:03.639
oh it's just on saves.

1315
00:54:03.639 --> 00:54:04.472
It's not saves.

1316
00:54:04.472 --> 00:54:06.588
That's not Bless. I'm sorry, that's something else.

1317
00:54:06.588 --> 00:54:07.921
TRAVIS: That's what she wrote.

1318
00:54:07.921 --> 00:54:09.312
MATT: She's casting Bless on Caleb?

1319
00:54:09.312 --> 00:54:11.705
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MATT: All right.

1320
00:54:11.705 --> 00:54:12.538
So--

1321
00:54:13.588 --> 00:54:15.572
TRAVIS: Three creatures of your choice within range.

1322
00:54:15.572 --> 00:54:19.540
So Caleb, Caduceus, and Yasha.

1323
00:54:20.771 --> 00:54:24.587
MATT: You guys move forward another 30 feet.

1324
00:54:24.587 --> 00:54:25.420
All right.

1325
00:54:27.082 --> 00:54:30.102
SAM: I'm going to look left and right this time.

1326
00:54:30.102 --> 00:54:31.445
MATT: Okay.

1327
00:54:31.445 --> 00:54:35.081
SAM: Over the, you know, out and about.

1328
00:54:35.081 --> 00:54:38.530
See if there's any movement outside of the bridge.

1329
00:54:38.530 --> 00:54:40.546
LIAM: We've not yet reached those cages yet, have we?

1330
00:54:40.546 --> 00:54:41.796
MATT: You have not.

1331
00:54:42.654 --> 00:54:44.245
This gets moved back a bit.

1332
00:54:45.242 --> 00:54:47.370
TALIESIN: This is so cool,

1333
00:54:47.370 --> 00:54:49.245
and yet terrible.

1334
00:54:50.591 --> 00:54:51.775
MATT: Make a perception check.

1335
00:54:51.775 --> 00:54:53.873
With disadvantage.

1336
00:54:53.873 --> 00:54:54.706
SAM: 10.

1337
00:54:55.690 --> 00:54:58.011
MATT: No sign yet of those sides.

1338
00:54:58.011 --> 00:54:59.437
Everyone make a stealth check,

1339
00:54:59.437 --> 00:55:01.438
without the Pass Without a Trace bonus.

1340
00:55:01.438 --> 00:55:02.495
TRAVIS: Oh, really?

1341
00:55:02.495 --> 00:55:03.328
MATT: It's concentration.

1342
00:55:03.328 --> 00:55:04.353
So is Bless.

1343
00:55:04.353 --> 00:55:06.898
(groaning)

1344
00:55:06.898 --> 00:55:07.731
ASHLEY: Okay.

1345
00:55:09.167 --> 00:55:10.470
SAM: Laura Bailey.

1346
00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:13.433
TRAVIS: That feels like first time user error on my part.

1347
00:55:14.425 --> 00:55:15.702
(sighing)

1348
00:55:15.702 --> 00:55:16.652
SAM: 29.

1349
00:55:16.652 --> 00:55:17.893
TRAVIS: That's...

1350
00:55:19.435 --> 00:55:20.418
something she asked me to do

1351
00:55:20.418 --> 00:55:22.842
before Pass Without a Trace, but okay.

1352
00:55:24.786 --> 00:55:25.690
MATT: It's okay.

1353
00:55:25.690 --> 00:55:27.364
So 15?
LIAM: 15, yep.

1354
00:55:27.364 --> 00:55:28.239
MARISHA: Natural one.

1355
00:55:32.330 --> 00:55:33.163
TRAVIS: 17.

1356
00:55:34.082 --> 00:55:35.623
MATT: And for Jester?

1357
00:55:35.623 --> 00:55:37.289
TRAVIS: 20.

1358
00:55:37.289 --> 00:55:38.615
MATT: What'd you get, Nott?

1359
00:55:38.615 --> 00:55:39.887
SAM: 26 or something.

1360
00:55:39.887 --> 00:55:41.775
TALIESIN: Natural 20, 21.

1361
00:55:41.775 --> 00:55:43.150
TRAVIS: Laura's calling.

1362
00:55:43.150 --> 00:55:46.456
(laughter)

1363
00:55:46.456 --> 00:55:47.289
TRAVIS: Yes?

1364
00:55:49.587 --> 00:55:51.369
(laughter)

1365
00:55:51.369 --> 00:55:52.981
MARISHA: I can hear it.

1366
00:55:52.981 --> 00:55:54.287
TRAVIS: Wait, Blessing of the Trickster?

1367
00:55:54.287 --> 00:55:55.261
TALIESIN: Oh!

1368
00:55:55.261 --> 00:55:56.494
That makes more sense.

1369
00:55:56.494 --> 00:55:58.013
LIAM: This is a one of a kind marriage.

1370
00:55:58.013 --> 00:55:59.505
One of a kind.
TRAVIS: Blessing of the Trickster

1371
00:55:59.505 --> 00:56:01.344
gives advantage on stealth, not save.

1372
00:56:01.344 --> 00:56:03.517
MATT: That it does.

1373
00:56:03.517 --> 00:56:04.350
Okay.

1374
00:56:05.612 --> 00:56:06.997
LIAM: (Charlie Brown teacher noises) Wah wah wah...

1375
00:56:06.997 --> 00:56:09.255
TRAVIS: Pass Without a Trace stays,

1376
00:56:09.255 --> 00:56:10.491
Blessing of the Trickster.

1377
00:56:10.491 --> 00:56:11.648
Okay.

1378
00:56:11.648 --> 00:56:12.960
So that's just on you.

1379
00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:14.080
LIAM: I'm given stealth advantage?

1380
00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:15.113
TRAVIS: Advantage on stealth

1381
00:56:15.113 --> 00:56:16.504
and Pass Without a Trace stays up.

1382
00:56:16.504 --> 00:56:17.876
I love you, goodbye.

1383
00:56:17.876 --> 00:56:19.596
(laughter)

1384
00:56:19.596 --> 00:56:21.046
LIAM: For this most recent roll?

1385
00:56:21.046 --> 00:56:22.371
TRAVIS: Yes, it's still up.

1386
00:56:22.371 --> 00:56:25.985
MATT: All right, I'll allow it.

1387
00:56:25.985 --> 00:56:26.935
MARISHA: But I still rolled a natural one.

1388
00:56:26.935 --> 00:56:28.444
MATT: It's still a natural one.
MARISHA: Fuck, okay.

1389
00:56:28.444 --> 00:56:29.418
TALIESIN: 31.

1390
00:56:29.418 --> 00:56:30.832
MATT: All right, so, it's okay.

1391
00:56:30.832 --> 00:56:32.682
General, adding to all those numbers,

1392
00:56:32.682 --> 00:56:35.143
you guys still seem to progress all right.

1393
00:56:35.143 --> 00:56:36.511
TALIESIN: Natural 20!

1394
00:56:36.511 --> 00:56:38.494
MARISHA: Thank you.

1395
00:56:38.494 --> 00:56:41.754
TALIESIN: This die is my new favorite die at the moment.

1396
00:56:41.754 --> 00:56:43.840
Don't betray me, die.

1397
00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:45.090
I love you, die.

1398
00:56:46.969 --> 00:56:48.302
Don't be a dick.

1399
00:56:51.248 --> 00:56:55.879
MATT: Moving ahead another 30 feet.

1400
00:56:55.879 --> 00:56:57.558
We inch forward.

1401
00:56:57.558 --> 00:56:59.272
You're now getting close to the center of the bridge.

1402
00:56:59.272 --> 00:57:03.434
You can feel the bowing of it beginning to level out.

1403
00:57:03.434 --> 00:57:04.975
You can also feel every movement

1404
00:57:04.975 --> 00:57:07.725
causing it to sway a little more.

1405
00:57:08.610 --> 00:57:10.978
There's still no wind, but with your movement and shifting,

1406
00:57:10.978 --> 00:57:12.357
even as careful as you are,

1407
00:57:12.357 --> 00:57:13.307
you know that you're now

1408
00:57:13.307 --> 00:57:18.307
furthest from any sort of anchor point on the structure.

1409
00:57:18.715 --> 00:57:20.352
SAM: This time, instead of checking for traps,

1410
00:57:20.352 --> 00:57:25.352
I'm going to check for any imperfections or weaknesses

1411
00:57:25.625 --> 00:57:28.592
in the section ahead.

1412
00:57:28.592 --> 00:57:31.740
MATT: Okay. Perception check.

1413
00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:34.002
SAM: 11.
MATT: Okay.

1414
00:57:34.002 --> 00:57:35.522
So you're just keeping an eye out as you're going forward.

1415
00:57:35.522 --> 00:57:36.797
TALIESIN: Eyes of the Grave.

1416
00:57:36.797 --> 00:57:38.080
I want to see if there's any undead,

1417
00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:40.294
anything undead within 60 feet.

1418
00:57:40.294 --> 00:57:41.559
MATT: Okay, cool.

1419
00:57:41.559 --> 00:57:43.146
LIAM: And Caleb is just quietly sweating

1420
00:57:43.146 --> 00:57:45.182
because he's feeling Caduceus' huge weight

1421
00:57:45.182 --> 00:57:49.185
make the bridge behind him go (wobbling sounds).

1422
00:57:49.185 --> 00:57:50.695
MATT: All right.

1423
00:57:50.695 --> 00:57:52.642
Stealth checks when you're ready, please.

1424
00:57:52.642 --> 00:57:54.421
SAM: With advantage?

1425
00:57:54.421 --> 00:57:56.452
ASHLEY and MATT: Plus 10.

1426
00:57:56.452 --> 00:57:58.688
You get advantage from Blessing of the Trickster.

1427
00:57:58.688 --> 00:58:00.056
LIAM: And also Pass Without a Trace?

1428
00:58:00.056 --> 00:58:00.889
TALIESIN and MATT: Yeah.
LIAM: Oh, great.

1429
00:58:03.385 --> 00:58:05.602
TRAVIS: 21.
MATT: And Jester got?

1430
00:58:05.602 --> 00:58:06.715
TRAVIS: Jester, she's rolling.

1431
00:58:06.715 --> 00:58:08.574
MARISHA: 37.
LIAM: 21.

1432
00:58:08.574 --> 00:58:10.519
SAM: 35.
TALIESIN: 20.

1433
00:58:10.519 --> 00:58:13.341
ASHLEY: 31.
MATT: You got it.

1434
00:58:13.341 --> 00:58:14.321
All right.

1435
00:58:14.321 --> 00:58:16.493
TRAVIS: Jester rolled a 29.

1436
00:58:16.493 --> 00:58:17.495
MATT: All right.

1437
00:58:17.495 --> 00:58:19.886
MARISHA: She's rolling at home? That's dope.

1438
00:58:19.886 --> 00:58:20.719
TALIESIN: That is dope.

1439
00:58:20.719 --> 00:58:21.953
SAM: She's rolling at home?

1440
00:58:21.953 --> 00:58:24.179
She should just come into the--

1441
00:58:24.179 --> 00:58:27.329
I guess she's sick.
TRAVIS: You don't want her to do that.

1442
00:58:27.329 --> 00:58:28.945
SAM: She could be on a--

1443
00:58:28.945 --> 00:58:32.308
LIAM: She looked and sounded like sickness!

1444
00:58:32.308 --> 00:58:35.970
MATT: So moving forward still.

1445
00:58:35.970 --> 00:58:36.803
TALIESIN: Oh man!

1446
00:58:39.638 --> 00:58:42.458
(screaming)

1447
00:58:42.458 --> 00:58:44.383
TRAVIS: Jester, we couldn't save you!

1448
00:58:44.383 --> 00:58:45.550
MATT: Sorry, Laura!

1449
00:58:46.454 --> 00:58:48.685
LIAM: (like Jester) Why didn't you come?

1450
00:58:48.685 --> 00:58:50.332
SAM: (like Jester) Tell my story!

1451
00:58:50.332 --> 00:58:52.582
(laughter)

1452
00:58:54.515 --> 00:58:55.515
MATT: All right.

1453
00:58:56.799 --> 00:58:58.865
All moving on, continuing forward.

1454
00:58:58.865 --> 00:59:01.566
I need everyone to make a new stealth check, please.

1455
00:59:01.566 --> 00:59:04.333
This one'll be universally with disadvantage

1456
00:59:04.333 --> 00:59:07.224
due to the center point of the bridge.

1457
00:59:07.224 --> 00:59:08.434
LIAM: So straight roll for me?

1458
00:59:08.434 --> 00:59:10.773
MATT: Straight roll for you.

1459
00:59:10.773 --> 00:59:12.873
MARISHA: Still with the-- okay.

1460
00:59:12.873 --> 00:59:14.956
MATT: Still with the plus 10.

1461
00:59:16.025 --> 00:59:16.858
SAM: 28.

1462
00:59:18.579 --> 00:59:19.412
MARISHA: 31.

1463
00:59:20.484 --> 00:59:21.949
LIAM: 28.

1464
00:59:21.949 --> 00:59:24.449
TRAVIS: 17 and a 26.

1465
00:59:25.485 --> 00:59:27.719
TALIESIN: 17.
ASHLEY: One.

1466
00:59:27.719 --> 00:59:29.806
TALIESIN: Oh, natural one?

1467
00:59:29.806 --> 00:59:31.011
ASHLEY: Yeah.

1468
00:59:31.011 --> 00:59:32.511
TALIESIN: So what's, uh--

1469
00:59:35.174 --> 00:59:37.061
MATT: So you guys make it to the center point.

1470
00:59:37.061 --> 00:59:38.372
Couple cool things you do notice.

1471
00:59:38.372 --> 00:59:40.170
SAM and TALIESIN: Couple cool things?

1472
00:59:40.170 --> 00:59:41.783
MATT: Depending on what you're looking for out there.

1473
00:59:43.083 --> 00:59:45.974
TALIESIN: Like we found some--
LAURA: Gerd dermit.

1474
00:59:45.974 --> 00:59:48.377
LIAM: A cage full of flying carpets.

1475
00:59:48.377 --> 00:59:50.427
SAM: Get in the cage.

1476
00:59:50.427 --> 00:59:52.172
MATT: There you see.

1477
00:59:52.172 --> 00:59:55.163
Well, she would be on this side. My apologies.

1478
00:59:55.163 --> 00:59:56.527
SAM: Apology accepted.
MATT: Thank you.

1479
00:59:56.527 --> 00:59:58.392
(laughter)

1480
00:59:58.392 --> 01:00:02.239
MATT: The first one of the spires that levels off

1481
01:00:02.239 --> 01:00:03.305
and has the cage off to the side

1482
01:00:03.305 --> 01:00:05.477
comes into view to your left.

1483
01:00:05.477 --> 01:00:08.386
TALIESIN: Does this hit the detect undead that's up?

1484
01:00:08.386 --> 01:00:10.469
MATT: No, it does not.
TALIESIN: Okay.

1485
01:00:12.630 --> 01:00:15.729
MATT: However, you do hear a rising

1486
01:00:15.729 --> 01:00:18.742
(menacing whispers)

1487
01:00:18.742 --> 01:00:21.220
The voices begin to swarm up from underneath.

1488
01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:24.599
Previously sourcelessly, you can now feel them

1489
01:00:24.599 --> 01:00:26.349
coming up from all sides

1490
01:00:26.349 --> 01:00:27.658
in the middle of this chasm

1491
01:00:27.658 --> 01:00:30.753
and just swarming and filling the space around you,

1492
01:00:30.753 --> 01:00:33.908
piercing your ears as you try and close them off, your mind.

1493
01:00:33.908 --> 01:00:36.808
Everybody make a wisdom check please.

1494
01:00:36.808 --> 01:00:38.209
SAM: Just a straight wisdom check?

1495
01:00:38.209 --> 01:00:39.295
MATT: A wisdom saving throw, sorry.

1496
01:00:39.295 --> 01:00:40.584
MARISHA: Oh my god.

1497
01:00:40.584 --> 01:00:41.417
TALIESIN: Out of curiosity, does my

1498
01:00:41.417 --> 01:00:42.634
Protection from Good and Evil

1499
01:00:42.634 --> 01:00:44.506
mean I don't have to do that?

1500
01:00:44.506 --> 01:00:45.339
MARISHA: Oh!

1501
01:00:49.459 --> 01:00:51.330
TALIESIN: I'm protected from aberrations, celestials,

1502
01:00:51.330 --> 01:00:54.922
elementals, faes, fiends, and undead, and...

1503
01:00:56.248 --> 01:00:57.671
can't be charmed, frightened, or possessed.

1504
01:00:58.805 --> 01:00:59.721
MATT: Correct.

1505
01:01:01.952 --> 01:01:03.974
It does not, unfortunately, help you.

1506
01:01:03.974 --> 01:01:05.283
TALIESIN: All right, so wisdom save.

1507
01:01:05.283 --> 01:01:06.331
MATT: Yes.

1508
01:01:06.331 --> 01:01:07.164
So Fjord?

1509
01:01:08.652 --> 01:01:09.485
TRAVIS: Six.

1510
01:01:09.485 --> 01:01:11.114
MATT: Okay, Jester?

1511
01:01:11.114 --> 01:01:12.887
TRAVIS: 13.
MATT: Okay.

1512
01:01:12.887 --> 01:01:14.210
MARISHA: Five.

1513
01:01:14.210 --> 01:01:15.493
LIAM: 17.

1514
01:01:15.493 --> 01:01:16.769
SAM: Four.

1515
01:01:16.769 --> 01:01:17.761
LIAM: Oh, jeez.

1516
01:01:17.761 --> 01:01:18.952
TALIESIN: 22.

1517
01:01:18.952 --> 01:01:19.785
LIAM: Oh, thank goodness.

1518
01:01:19.785 --> 01:01:22.767
ASHLEY: It was so close to a one and then it went, boop.

1519
01:01:22.767 --> 01:01:23.970
16 total.

1520
01:01:23.970 --> 01:01:26.639
MATT: Okay, so it looks like we have--

1521
01:01:26.639 --> 01:01:27.753
TRAVIS: Six, five, four.

1522
01:01:27.753 --> 01:01:30.122
MATT: Six, five, four, all right.

1523
01:01:30.122 --> 01:01:33.973
MARISHA: Three, two, one.
SAM: And 13 was also sort of low.

1524
01:01:33.973 --> 01:01:36.429
MATT: 13 was enough.
SAM: Okay.

1525
01:01:36.429 --> 01:01:38.315
MATT: Jester is unaffected.

1526
01:01:38.315 --> 01:01:40.732
So first in the line is Nott.

1527
01:01:42.231 --> 01:01:45.949
You, as you had been slowly moving forward,

1528
01:01:45.949 --> 01:01:49.725
Nott just stops and just goes catatonic.

1529
01:01:49.725 --> 01:01:50.849
Yasha, you bump into Nott,

1530
01:01:50.849 --> 01:01:53.603
and Nott's just not moving and not reacting,

1531
01:01:53.603 --> 01:01:55.436
at all, to any of you.

1532
01:01:57.175 --> 01:01:58.008
Fjord.

1533
01:02:01.938 --> 01:02:03.939
Fjord just also stops and goes catatonic.

1534
01:02:03.939 --> 01:02:06.689
His expression just falling flat.

1535
01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:14.470
Could you go ahead and roll a d6 for me?

1536
01:02:17.345 --> 01:02:18.461
ASHLEY: I don't like that.
TALIESIN: I don't like this.

1537
01:02:19.297 --> 01:02:21.347
Sorry, technically this would be Beauregard doing this.

1538
01:02:21.347 --> 01:02:22.196
TRAVIS: Okay, good.
MATT: Beauregard,

1539
01:02:22.196 --> 01:02:23.674
if you can roll a d6 for me, please.

1540
01:02:23.674 --> 01:02:25.976
MARISHA: I roll a d6 and it involves him?

1541
01:02:25.976 --> 01:02:28.015
MATT: Well, it should have been you.

1542
01:02:28.015 --> 01:02:30.033
MARISHA: Oh, it should have been me?

1543
01:02:30.033 --> 01:02:32.059
LIAM: Make it so.

1544
01:02:32.059 --> 01:02:33.486
MARISHA: Four.

1545
01:02:33.486 --> 01:02:34.840
MATT: Okay.

1546
01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:38.270
Beauregard suddenly turns to the side

1547
01:02:38.270 --> 01:02:41.250
and begins walking towards the edge of the bridge,

1548
01:02:41.250 --> 01:02:44.284
hits the chain, and just tumbles off the edge.

1549
01:02:44.284 --> 01:02:45.830
You guys reach out and grab the rope,

1550
01:02:45.830 --> 01:02:47.857
and she goes over and falls about five feet

1551
01:02:47.857 --> 01:02:50.593
before (creaking), hanging on the rope.

1552
01:02:50.593 --> 01:02:52.310
TRAVIS: Jester helps Caleb with it.

1553
01:02:52.310 --> 01:02:54.553
MATT: You guys slide over a bit,

1554
01:02:54.553 --> 01:02:56.863
holding onto the rope.

1555
01:02:56.863 --> 01:03:00.027
The chains now dangling a bit.

1556
01:03:00.027 --> 01:03:01.884
The chains rattling slightly.

1557
01:03:01.884 --> 01:03:03.660
TALIESIN: It's tug of war. We're all in.

1558
01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:04.493
ASHLEY: Jester's helping, too.

1559
01:03:04.493 --> 01:03:06.305
I'm helping.
TRAVIS: Some of y'all are helping.

1560
01:03:06.305 --> 01:03:09.088
MATT: Right, so, who's helming the strength check on this?

1561
01:03:09.088 --> 01:03:10.262
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: Jester.

1562
01:03:10.262 --> 01:03:11.771
MATT: All right, I'll have Jester

1563
01:03:11.771 --> 01:03:13.263
roll a strength check, with advantage,

1564
01:03:13.263 --> 01:03:15.950
because Yasha's also helping on this.

1565
01:03:15.950 --> 01:03:17.892
You guys are all slowly pulling Beauregard up,

1566
01:03:17.892 --> 01:03:18.756
back onto the bridge.

1567
01:03:18.756 --> 01:03:20.664
The bridge is now bowing to that side,

1568
01:03:20.664 --> 01:03:23.148
the chains are rattling, noise is happening right now,

1569
01:03:23.148 --> 01:03:25.840
unavoidably, in this moment.

1570
01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:26.906
TRAVIS: Advantage, right?

1571
01:03:26.906 --> 01:03:29.019
ASHLEY: Yep.
TRAVIS: Oh, Jesus, god.

1572
01:03:29.019 --> 01:03:29.936
Okay, okay.

1573
01:03:31.164 --> 01:03:33.356
Her modifier is a...

1574
01:03:33.356 --> 01:03:35.522
MATT: Modifier's plus three, I think, right?

1575
01:03:35.522 --> 01:03:37.694
TRAVIS: Yep, plus three. Okay.

1576
01:03:37.694 --> 01:03:38.586
Fuck it, I'll just do it.

1577
01:03:38.586 --> 01:03:39.419
I don't know where she is.

1578
01:03:39.419 --> 01:03:40.252
MATT: It's okay.

1579
01:03:42.068 --> 01:03:44.963
TRAVIS: Okay, 19, plus three, so 22.

1580
01:03:44.963 --> 01:03:46.838
MATT: Yep, without issue, you manage to pull Beauregard

1581
01:03:46.838 --> 01:03:49.063
back up onto the bridge.

1582
01:03:53.756 --> 01:03:56.817
ASHLEY: If I'm looking at Beau, is she out of it?

1583
01:03:56.817 --> 01:03:58.516
TRAVIS: Yeah, is she back or still staring?

1584
01:03:58.516 --> 01:03:59.806
MATT: Yeah, Beauregard, for some reason,

1585
01:03:59.806 --> 01:04:01.119
your brain just went clouded for a second.

1586
01:04:01.119 --> 01:04:03.689
The sounds hit you, your eyes opened again,

1587
01:04:03.689 --> 01:04:05.429
and you're hanging over the side.

1588
01:04:05.429 --> 01:04:07.140
Make a perception check for me, by the way,

1589
01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:08.270
as you're over the edge.

1590
01:04:08.270 --> 01:04:10.325
MARISHA: That is the most terrifying thing, by the way.

1591
01:04:10.325 --> 01:04:11.406
LIAM: Wake up--

1592
01:04:11.406 --> 01:04:15.656
MATT: Just dangling into darkness below you.

1593
01:04:17.222 --> 01:04:18.668
MARISHA: A perception check?

1594
01:04:18.668 --> 01:04:21.614
MATT: Yes.
MARISHA: Jesus, shit, nine.

1595
01:04:21.614 --> 01:04:23.326
MATT: Okay, darkness below.

1596
01:04:23.326 --> 01:04:25.113
You have no idea what lays beneath,

1597
01:04:25.113 --> 01:04:27.196
but you can hear the whispers, just louder,

1598
01:04:27.196 --> 01:04:29.418
from your perspective and suddenly you're (grunting)

1599
01:04:29.418 --> 01:04:31.711
tugged up and pulled back onto the bridge.

1600
01:04:31.711 --> 01:04:33.935
MARISHA: I just clasp my mouth and try not to gasp.

1601
01:04:33.935 --> 01:04:34.768
MATT: Okay.

1602
01:04:36.789 --> 01:04:40.382
The whispers (air blowing) die down slightly.

1603
01:04:40.382 --> 01:04:43.199
TRAVIS: What about those of us that were just stopped?

1604
01:04:43.199 --> 01:04:45.249
MATT: You guys come to again.

1605
01:04:45.249 --> 01:04:47.496
There's a brief second where time

1606
01:04:47.496 --> 01:04:51.691
didn't pass or like you skipped about six seconds.

1607
01:04:51.691 --> 01:04:56.349
SAM: I don't know if I can do this anymore.

1608
01:04:56.349 --> 01:04:59.419
This is scary and I don't like it.

1609
01:04:59.419 --> 01:05:00.752
I don't like it!

1610
01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:04.054
I don't want to go anymore!

1611
01:05:04.054 --> 01:05:06.752
I definitely don't want to go anymore!

1612
01:05:06.752 --> 01:05:07.855
ASHLEY: Nott!

1613
01:05:07.855 --> 01:05:09.136
You have to!

1614
01:05:09.136 --> 01:05:10.850
We either have to go back the same amount

1615
01:05:10.850 --> 01:05:13.069
or we go forward the same amount.

1616
01:05:13.069 --> 01:05:14.473
We're closer to the other side of the bridge.

1617
01:05:14.473 --> 01:05:16.843
Let's go. Move.

1618
01:05:16.843 --> 01:05:19.518
SAM: Okay, if you're going to use that voice, sure.

1619
01:05:21.812 --> 01:05:22.828
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

1620
01:05:26.045 --> 01:05:29.173
MARISHA: Oh my god.
TALIESIN: This is so much.

1621
01:05:29.173 --> 01:05:32.914
MATT: Go forward another 30 feet stealthily.

1622
01:05:33.936 --> 01:05:37.928
I would like everyone to make a stealth check,

1623
01:05:37.928 --> 01:05:39.382
Nott with disadvantage.

1624
01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:41.721
Because of your outburst.

1625
01:05:41.721 --> 01:05:43.676
ASHLEY: Not with disadvantage?

1626
01:05:43.676 --> 01:05:46.441
MATT: Nott.
TRAVIS: Because of your outburst.

1627
01:05:46.441 --> 01:05:49.137
Control yourself, Samuel!

1628
01:05:49.137 --> 01:05:50.826
ASHLEY: We just have a straight roll now?

1629
01:05:50.826 --> 01:05:51.659
TALIESIN: Plus 10.

1630
01:05:53.284 --> 01:05:56.117
TRAVIS: 24 for Jester and Fjord.
MATT: Great.

1631
01:05:57.011 --> 01:05:58.364
MARISHA: We still have the plus 10 as well?

1632
01:05:58.364 --> 01:06:00.392
MATT: Correct.
MARISHA: So 35.

1633
01:06:00.392 --> 01:06:01.978
LIAM: 28.
SAM: 37.

1634
01:06:01.978 --> 01:06:04.061
TALIESIN: 13.
MATT: Yasha?

1635
01:06:05.539 --> 01:06:06.539
ASHLEY: 24.
MATT: Okay.

1636
01:06:07.715 --> 01:06:09.925
Moving forward, a little more safely,

1637
01:06:09.925 --> 01:06:10.849
a little more quiet.

1638
01:06:10.849 --> 01:06:12.554
You've gathered yourselves here.

1639
01:06:12.554 --> 01:06:14.648
Pushing forward at this point, too,

1640
01:06:14.648 --> 01:06:17.955
as this moves along with you guys shifting,

1641
01:06:17.955 --> 01:06:21.122
you can now see, on the opposite side,

1642
01:06:23.836 --> 01:06:25.952
another platform here.

1643
01:06:25.952 --> 01:06:27.160
SAM and TALIESIN: Oh boy.

1644
01:06:28.338 --> 01:06:30.736
SAM: How many of those you got back there, Matt?

1645
01:06:30.736 --> 01:06:31.827
MATT: Mm-hmm.

1646
01:06:31.827 --> 01:06:32.660
SAM: Oh boy.

1647
01:06:32.660 --> 01:06:33.493
TRAVIS: Should we go check out--

1648
01:06:33.493 --> 01:06:36.268
MATT: Actually, this continues on here.
LIAM: What are you looking at?

1649
01:06:37.817 --> 01:06:38.749
What's out there?

1650
01:06:38.749 --> 01:06:39.908
TRAVIS: I have a question.

1651
01:06:39.908 --> 01:06:43.515
Is there anything in the one to our left now?

1652
01:06:43.515 --> 01:06:45.427
The one that's closest to us?

1653
01:06:45.427 --> 01:06:48.937
MATT: You glance over and you can see

1654
01:06:48.937 --> 01:06:50.645
what Caleb described earlier,

1655
01:06:50.645 --> 01:06:52.544
a corpse lying inside the cage.

1656
01:06:52.544 --> 01:06:55.573
Skeletal, the flesh turned to

1657
01:06:55.573 --> 01:06:58.713
a paper-like mummified skin,

1658
01:06:58.713 --> 01:07:02.173
pulled tight against the skull, sockets barren.

1659
01:07:02.173 --> 01:07:04.062
ASHLEY: What if they have goodies?

1660
01:07:05.337 --> 01:07:08.234
TRAVIS: Do we see any weapons like around them

1661
01:07:08.234 --> 01:07:09.651
that they would--

1662
01:07:10.537 --> 01:07:12.704
MATT: Make a perception check.

1663
01:07:15.356 --> 01:07:17.329
TRAVIS: That's a natural one.

1664
01:07:17.329 --> 01:07:20.152
MATT: You have no idea.

1665
01:07:20.152 --> 01:07:21.931
TRAVIS: That's where I'd put something valuable.

1666
01:07:21.931 --> 01:07:23.452
SAM: Oh my god.

1667
01:07:23.452 --> 01:07:25.250
TALIESIN: That looks like a security device to me.

1668
01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:28.300
TRAVIS: Is it about

1669
01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:31.352
20 feet to the pedestal from the bridge?

1670
01:07:31.352 --> 01:07:32.997
MATT: About 20 feet from the pedestal, yeah.

1671
01:07:32.997 --> 01:07:34.263
You guys moving ahead another 30 feet?

1672
01:07:34.263 --> 01:07:35.371
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.
SAM: Yeah.

1673
01:07:35.371 --> 01:07:36.539
TRAVIS: But--! (stuttering)

1674
01:07:36.539 --> 01:07:38.234
What if there's some amazing--

1675
01:07:38.234 --> 01:07:40.645
SAM: I'll check for traps this time through.

1676
01:07:40.645 --> 01:07:43.395
MATT: All right so move back 20 feet.

1677
01:07:45.144 --> 01:07:47.341
SAM: That's a 21 to see if there's any traps ahead.

1678
01:07:47.341 --> 01:07:48.341
MATT: All right.

1679
01:07:49.277 --> 01:07:50.305
SAM: What? What?

1680
01:07:50.305 --> 01:07:51.182
(louder) What are you saying?

1681
01:07:51.182 --> 01:07:52.617
(shushing)
LIAM: I start whispering

1682
01:07:52.617 --> 01:07:56.936
up the line. Fjord wants to know if you want to use your--

1683
01:07:56.936 --> 01:07:58.701
SAM: So you have to whisper that to Beau,

1684
01:07:58.701 --> 01:07:59.964
who has to whisper it to Jester,

1685
01:07:59.964 --> 01:08:01.270
who has to whisper it to Yasha,

1686
01:08:01.270 --> 01:08:02.857
so by the time it gets to me,

1687
01:08:02.857 --> 01:08:04.274
it sounds like...

1688
01:08:06.123 --> 01:08:09.494
Fjord wants to stop and take a dump right now?

1689
01:08:10.610 --> 01:08:11.986
TRAVIS: You look back and I'm like.

1690
01:08:11.986 --> 01:08:15.278
(laughter)

1691
01:08:18.868 --> 01:08:21.086
SAM: What is that?

1692
01:08:21.086 --> 01:08:21.925
Oh?

1693
01:08:21.925 --> 01:08:22.958
LIAM: (like Nott) Catch it in my hand?

1694
01:08:22.958 --> 01:08:25.208
(laughter)

1695
01:08:26.134 --> 01:08:27.350
Do you want me to?

1696
01:08:27.350 --> 01:08:29.581
They want me to cast a spell?

1697
01:08:29.581 --> 01:08:31.381
All right, all right.

1698
01:08:31.381 --> 01:08:33.628
How far away are those things?

1699
01:08:33.628 --> 01:08:36.562
MATT: From you right now, it's about 40 feet from you.

1700
01:08:36.562 --> 01:08:39.156
SAM: Is it 30 or 60 for Mage Hand?

1701
01:08:39.156 --> 01:08:40.520
It's 30, right?

1702
01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:42.386
MATT: The original casting, yeah.
SAM: Yeah, it's 30.

1703
01:08:42.386 --> 01:08:43.549
I got nothing.

1704
01:08:43.549 --> 01:08:45.160
MATT: You can back up.

1705
01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:47.743
SAM: Do you want me to back up?

1706
01:08:47.743 --> 01:08:51.326
TRAVIS: Come on, there's got to be some dope shit.

1707
01:08:52.469 --> 01:08:54.443
You think we're coming this way out?

1708
01:08:56.360 --> 01:09:00.130
Somebody look and see if you can find anything

1709
01:09:00.130 --> 01:09:02.000
besides armor in the cage.

1710
01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:06.833
My eyes are all fucky because I'm crying right now in fear.

1711
01:09:08.262 --> 01:09:10.335
TALIESIN: Detect Magic.

1712
01:09:10.335 --> 01:09:12.499
MATT: Okay, you cast Detect Magic for 60 feet?

1713
01:09:12.499 --> 01:09:14.691
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.
MATT: All right.

1714
01:09:14.691 --> 01:09:16.441
No magical aura.
TALIESIN: Okay.

1715
01:09:18.050 --> 01:09:18.891
LIAM: Eff that S.

1716
01:09:18.891 --> 01:09:19.724
TRAVIS: Okay, fuck.

1717
01:09:19.724 --> 01:09:21.224
SAM: "Eff that S."

1718
01:09:22.387 --> 01:09:23.995
(like Caleb) Eff that S.

1719
01:09:25.979 --> 01:09:29.307
MATT: All righty, continuing on for the next batch, then?

1720
01:09:29.307 --> 01:09:30.172
You checked for traps?

1721
01:09:30.172 --> 01:09:31.133
SAM: I did, 21 roll.

1722
01:09:31.133 --> 01:09:32.148
MATT: All right.

1723
01:09:32.148 --> 01:09:34.530
As you continue forward, you look,

1724
01:09:34.530 --> 01:09:36.757
and you can see that one of the metal bars,

1725
01:09:36.757 --> 01:09:39.271
the chain is rusted and pulled apart.

1726
01:09:39.271 --> 01:09:43.232
One of the bolts ahead looks like it's ready to snap.

1727
01:09:43.232 --> 01:09:44.399
SAM: I'm going to...

1728
01:09:46.912 --> 01:09:48.234
Skip that one!

1729
01:09:48.234 --> 01:09:51.151
Just skip this one, here, watch me.

1730
01:09:52.353 --> 01:09:53.324
ASHLEY: Okay, I try to do the same.

1731
01:09:53.324 --> 01:09:54.157
MATT: Okay.

1732
01:09:54.157 --> 01:09:55.421
You guys all follow suit

1733
01:09:55.421 --> 01:09:58.755
and carefully manage to make the next batch forward.

1734
01:10:00.222 --> 01:10:01.055
TALIESIN: This is so mean.

1735
01:10:01.055 --> 01:10:03.374
SAM: (German accent ) Eff that S.

1736
01:10:03.374 --> 01:10:04.599
ASHLEY: (quiet yelling)

1737
01:10:05.808 --> 01:10:07.453
TRAVIS: Oh fuck.

1738
01:10:07.453 --> 01:10:10.579
LIAM: You know it's just a saying, a colloquialism.

1739
01:10:10.579 --> 01:10:13.774
TRAVIS: Can I take a look at the new cage on the right,

1740
01:10:13.774 --> 01:10:14.991
see if its the same or...?

1741
01:10:14.991 --> 01:10:16.109
MATT: Make a perception check.

1742
01:10:16.109 --> 01:10:17.859
SAM: I killed my whole family.

1743
01:10:19.266 --> 01:10:21.165
LIAM: Hey, that's good! Bwah!

1744
01:10:21.165 --> 01:10:22.488
Killed my family!

1745
01:10:22.488 --> 01:10:23.996
TRAVIS: 21.

1746
01:10:25.050 --> 01:10:26.059
TRAVIS: That's much better.

1747
01:10:26.059 --> 01:10:27.339
I'm still whispering.

1748
01:10:27.339 --> 01:10:28.172
TALIESIN: I know.

1749
01:10:29.032 --> 01:10:30.552
TRAVIS: The terror's real.

1750
01:10:30.552 --> 01:10:32.126
MATT: 21?
TRAVIS: Natural 19.

1751
01:10:32.126 --> 01:10:33.009
MATT: Okay.

1752
01:10:33.009 --> 01:10:33.842
Looking across the way,

1753
01:10:33.842 --> 01:10:36.904
you can see there's two skeletons in that one.

1754
01:10:36.904 --> 01:10:38.274
TRAVIS: Two skeletons.

1755
01:10:38.274 --> 01:10:39.834
MATT: One of them is just crumpled.

1756
01:10:39.834 --> 01:10:41.415
The other is armored as well.

1757
01:10:41.415 --> 01:10:42.570
It's laying back,

1758
01:10:42.570 --> 01:10:45.552
and its head-- the whole spinal column's broken back

1759
01:10:45.552 --> 01:10:47.882
and you see it's snapped in the center there.

1760
01:10:47.882 --> 01:10:48.715
Yeah.

1761
01:10:50.286 --> 01:10:51.918
Looks like it has equipment.

1762
01:10:51.918 --> 01:10:53.743
Satchel, boots.

1763
01:10:54.598 --> 01:10:56.831
TRAVIS: It's got gear on it.

1764
01:10:56.831 --> 01:10:58.449
TALIESIN: My Detect Magic didn't detect--

1765
01:10:58.449 --> 01:11:00.512
MATT: Your Detect Magic does detect a magical source

1766
01:11:00.512 --> 01:11:01.722
in the inside of that cage across the way.

1767
01:11:01.722 --> 01:11:02.824
MARISHA: Oh shit!

1768
01:11:02.824 --> 01:11:03.657
MATT: I would also like you all

1769
01:11:03.657 --> 01:11:04.598
to make another stealth check,

1770
01:11:04.598 --> 01:11:06.492
please, as you're quietly moving across.

1771
01:11:07.601 --> 01:11:08.703
At disadvantage since you are now

1772
01:11:08.703 --> 01:11:10.320
in the center of the bridge.

1773
01:11:10.320 --> 01:11:11.160
ASHLEY: With disadvantage?

1774
01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:12.555
TRAVIS: Disadvantage.

1775
01:11:12.555 --> 01:11:13.389
LIAM: So straight roll for me?

1776
01:11:13.389 --> 01:11:14.639
MATT: Mm-hmm.
LIAM: Aw, balls.

1777
01:11:16.006 --> 01:11:17.663
SAM: This is a what check?

1778
01:11:17.663 --> 01:11:18.996
TALIESIN and MATT: Stealth check.

1779
01:11:20.062 --> 01:11:21.712
SAM: I usually have advantage.

1780
01:11:21.712 --> 01:11:23.925
MATT: So you're just a straight roll.

1781
01:11:23.925 --> 01:11:25.213
TRAVIS: 16.

1782
01:11:25.213 --> 01:11:26.630
MATT: And Jester?
MARISHA: We do still have Pass--

1783
01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:27.467
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1784
01:11:27.467 --> 01:11:28.395
ASHLEY: We do have Pass Without a Trace?

1785
01:11:28.395 --> 01:11:30.071
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1786
01:11:30.071 --> 01:11:31.321
LIAM: At disadvantage.

1787
01:11:32.783 --> 01:11:34.901
MARISHA: 22.
LIAM: 16.

1788
01:11:34.901 --> 01:11:36.488
SAM: Natural 20.
MATT: Nice.

1789
01:11:36.488 --> 01:11:38.085
TALIESIN: 15.
ASHLEY: 16.

1790
01:11:38.085 --> 01:11:40.726
TRAVIS: 19.
MATT: Okay.

1791
01:11:40.726 --> 01:11:42.537
You guys, as you're noticing the magical blip

1792
01:11:42.537 --> 01:11:44.556
and look over and see that,

1793
01:11:44.556 --> 01:11:46.820
you guys manage to avoid falling through

1794
01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:50.264
the piece of the bridge that Nott had picked out, but you,

1795
01:11:50.264 --> 01:11:52.934
looking over and noticing that, your heel

1796
01:11:52.934 --> 01:11:54.579
catches the edge of it and it (pinging)

1797
01:11:54.579 --> 01:11:58.547
(creaking) It's now dangling.

1798
01:11:58.547 --> 01:12:00.598
The loud noise causes the whispers once again

1799
01:12:00.598 --> 01:12:03.705
(aggravated whispering) rise up from underneath.

1800
01:12:03.705 --> 01:12:06.427
Everyone go ahead and make another wisdom saving throw.

1801
01:12:06.427 --> 01:12:07.261
SAM: Oh boy.

1802
01:12:07.261 --> 01:12:08.094
LIAM: Switching up dice.

1803
01:12:09.153 --> 01:12:10.892
Tiger eye.

1804
01:12:10.892 --> 01:12:12.631
MARISHA: Even those who saved before?

1805
01:12:12.631 --> 01:12:13.464
MATT: Yep.

1806
01:12:14.478 --> 01:12:15.943
TRAVIS: It's just regular wisdom, right?

1807
01:12:15.943 --> 01:12:18.526
MATT: Correct, wisdom saving throw.

1808
01:12:20.748 --> 01:12:22.831
TRAVIS: Holy fuck, 11.
MATT: 11.

1809
01:12:24.492 --> 01:12:25.898
And Jester?
TRAVIS: 19.

1810
01:12:25.898 --> 01:12:27.342
MATT: All right.
MARISHA: 21.

1811
01:12:27.342 --> 01:12:28.274
LIAM: 11.

1812
01:12:28.274 --> 01:12:30.145
SAM: 11.
TALIESIN: 28.

1813
01:12:30.145 --> 01:12:31.660
ASHLEY: 16.
MATT: All right.

1814
01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:35.576
So Fjord, Caleb, and Nott.

1815
01:12:36.647 --> 01:12:38.835
So as you're looking forward, Fjord,

1816
01:12:38.835 --> 01:12:41.160
the whispers rise up into your brain.

1817
01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:42.416
You try and close it off again.

1818
01:12:42.416 --> 01:12:44.749
You tighten your eyes and...

1819
01:12:47.024 --> 01:12:49.140
Just go catatonic in that space.

1820
01:12:51.734 --> 01:12:52.567
Caleb.

1821
01:12:54.302 --> 01:12:58.972
You are standing there and Caduceus is looking over.

1822
01:12:58.972 --> 01:13:03.424
You look back at Caduceus and swipe at him.

1823
01:13:03.424 --> 01:13:05.698
Go ahead and roll an attack for me, please.

1824
01:13:05.698 --> 01:13:08.201
TRAVIS: Wizard claws.
MARISHA: Oh my god.

1825
01:13:08.201 --> 01:13:10.802
SAM: God, your attacks are--
TRAVIS: Do you trigger it?

1826
01:13:10.802 --> 01:13:12.375
LIAM: Deadly. I am deadly.

1827
01:13:12.375 --> 01:13:14.376
That is a ten to hit.

1828
01:13:14.376 --> 01:13:16.340
MATT: Caleb suddenly goes feral

1829
01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:18.128
and starts clawing at you with his fingers.

1830
01:13:18.128 --> 01:13:19.375
TALIESIN: I'm literally just going to--

1831
01:13:21.142 --> 01:13:22.611
MATT: Like hold his forehead at bay.

1832
01:13:22.611 --> 01:13:24.801
TALIESIN: It's just going to be a quiet whoa, whoa, boy.

1833
01:13:24.801 --> 01:13:26.676
(laughter)

1834
01:13:26.676 --> 01:13:29.604
I'm just going to hold him through it.

1835
01:13:29.604 --> 01:13:31.521
LIAM: Ease down, ease down.

1836
01:13:32.771 --> 01:13:33.994
MATT: Nott.

1837
01:13:33.994 --> 01:13:34.827
SAM: Oh god.

1838
01:13:35.705 --> 01:13:36.648
MATT: As you're all watching this

1839
01:13:36.648 --> 01:13:39.081
and looking over at the side-- Yasha, you see this.

1840
01:13:39.081 --> 01:13:41.586
You hear the bridge go (creaking) and the whispers coming

1841
01:13:41.586 --> 01:13:43.984
and close your eyes and you cover your ears

1842
01:13:43.984 --> 01:13:48.767
and you look forward, just as you see Nott pulling your--

1843
01:13:48.767 --> 01:13:51.616
they're not crossbows, melee, so what's your-- shortsword?

1844
01:13:51.616 --> 01:13:52.499
SAM: I have a shortsword.

1845
01:13:52.499 --> 01:13:54.531
Or I have Shocking Grasp.

1846
01:13:54.531 --> 01:13:55.770
MATT: You can do shortsword.
SAM: Okay.

1847
01:13:55.770 --> 01:13:57.780
MATT: Go ahead and make a shortsword attack against Yasha.

1848
01:13:57.780 --> 01:14:00.250
SAM: Oh, I rolled real bad.

1849
01:14:00.250 --> 01:14:02.558
Like, real, real bad.

1850
01:14:02.558 --> 01:14:03.773
13.

1851
01:14:03.773 --> 01:14:06.168
MATT: Your armor class is?
ASHLEY: 15.

1852
01:14:06.168 --> 01:14:08.338
MATT: You catch Nott's wrist.

1853
01:14:08.338 --> 01:14:10.464
SAM: (angry grunting)

1854
01:14:10.464 --> 01:14:11.981
MATT: And the blood lust fades from both of you.

1855
01:14:11.981 --> 01:14:13.314
ASHLEY: Turn her around.

1856
01:14:14.966 --> 01:14:17.216
(laughter)

1857
01:14:18.475 --> 01:14:23.291
MATT: A couple of rocks (thudding) under the bridge.

1858
01:14:23.291 --> 01:14:26.550
TRAVIS: Now, can I just, wait a second.

1859
01:14:26.550 --> 01:14:28.483
It's hanging, right?

1860
01:14:28.483 --> 01:14:29.663
MATT: The little piece of metal, yeah.

1861
01:14:29.663 --> 01:14:30.688
TRAVIS: If we take another step,

1862
01:14:30.688 --> 01:14:33.153
it's going to make another sound.

1863
01:14:33.153 --> 01:14:35.752
Is it attached by one chain link on one side?

1864
01:14:35.752 --> 01:14:36.722
MATT: Mm-hmm.

1865
01:14:36.722 --> 01:14:39.134
TRAVIS: Does that chain link look rusted?

1866
01:14:39.134 --> 01:14:42.857
MATT: Maybe, it's a heavy-- they're thick links.

1867
01:14:42.857 --> 01:14:47.514
TRAVIS: I want to slowly try to pull the step up

1868
01:14:47.514 --> 01:14:49.770
and lay it on the step behind us,

1869
01:14:49.770 --> 01:14:52.065
so that it's not free flying as we continue on.

1870
01:14:52.065 --> 01:14:54.864
MATT: Okay, make a sleight of hand check for me.

1871
01:14:54.864 --> 01:14:56.413
SAM: It can only go good.

1872
01:14:56.413 --> 01:14:58.761
TRAVIS: Straight roll.
TALIESIN: I believe in you.

1873
01:14:58.761 --> 01:14:59.885
TRAVIS: A nine.

1874
01:14:59.885 --> 01:15:01.326
(laughter)

1875
01:15:01.326 --> 01:15:03.067
TALIESIN: Let's call a plumber.

1876
01:15:03.067 --> 01:15:05.242
MATT: (creaking)
(thudding)

1877
01:15:05.242 --> 01:15:07.200
(laughter)

1878
01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:08.917
(increasing whispers)

1879
01:15:08.917 --> 01:15:09.924
MARISHA: Oh, are you serious?

1880
01:15:09.924 --> 01:15:11.703
MATT: Everyone make another wisdom saving throw.

1881
01:15:11.703 --> 01:15:13.886
ASHLEY: At least it's not going to fall down into the chasm.

1882
01:15:13.886 --> 01:15:16.227
MATT: You got it over with. You got it over with.

1883
01:15:16.227 --> 01:15:17.416
ASHLEY: Okay.

1884
01:15:17.416 --> 01:15:19.640
MATT: We'll go to this side. Yasha?

1885
01:15:20.875 --> 01:15:21.865
ASHLEY: 19.
MATT: 19.

1886
01:15:21.865 --> 01:15:24.064
TALIESIN: 26.
SAM: 10.

1887
01:15:25.796 --> 01:15:27.424
LIAM: 22.
MARISHA: 18.

1888
01:15:28.474 --> 01:15:30.493
TRAVIS: Eight.
MATT: And Jester?

1889
01:15:30.493 --> 01:15:32.326
TRAVIS: I'll see if she responds,

1890
01:15:32.326 --> 01:15:33.692
but I'm going to roll this.
MATT: Currently, it's

1891
01:15:33.692 --> 01:15:35.216
Nott and Fjord.

1892
01:15:35.216 --> 01:15:36.098
ASHLEY: Oh, you said wisdom?

1893
01:15:36.098 --> 01:15:36.931
That was a wisdom?

1894
01:15:36.931 --> 01:15:37.807
SAM: This is a wisdom saving throw.

1895
01:15:37.807 --> 01:15:38.823
MATT: Wisdom save, yes.
ASHLEY: I'm so sorry.

1896
01:15:38.823 --> 01:15:40.403
TRAVIS: 13 for Jester.

1897
01:15:40.403 --> 01:15:41.637
No, 18, 18.

1898
01:15:44.269 --> 01:15:46.423
MATT: Okay, plus one. 16, sorry.

1899
01:15:46.423 --> 01:15:48.590
MATT: Okay, so Nott and Fjord.

1900
01:15:49.737 --> 01:15:50.570
Nott.

1901
01:15:51.968 --> 01:15:54.103
Nott goes running off the edge.

1902
01:15:54.103 --> 01:15:56.782
Like, turns, and just leaps off the side.

1903
01:15:56.782 --> 01:15:58.368
Yasha goes ahead and grabs the rope.

1904
01:15:58.368 --> 01:16:00.701
You fall down below.

1905
01:16:01.780 --> 01:16:05.210
LIAM: Around?
MATT: Like a very short range

1906
01:16:05.210 --> 01:16:09.823
bungee jump, the bridge shakes from the movement,

1907
01:16:09.823 --> 01:16:13.616
a couple more rocks fall from above.

1908
01:16:13.616 --> 01:16:16.068
A couple of pebbles fell earlier.

1909
01:16:16.068 --> 01:16:18.402
Nott, make a perception check for me.

1910
01:16:18.402 --> 01:16:19.382
SAM: It's going to be terrible.

1911
01:16:19.382 --> 01:16:20.215
It was a natural 20.

1912
01:16:20.215 --> 01:16:22.965
MATT: Natural 20.
(laughter)

1913
01:16:22.965 --> 01:16:24.761
MATT: So Nott, you once again come to

1914
01:16:24.761 --> 01:16:26.095
when you're dangling over the edge.

1915
01:16:26.095 --> 01:16:29.001
Your waist upheld by this rope going (panting).

1916
01:16:29.001 --> 01:16:30.190
You look down at the--

1917
01:16:30.190 --> 01:16:31.528
and now that you're down below the bridge,

1918
01:16:31.528 --> 01:16:35.019
you look in the periphery and you can see shapes below you.

1919
01:16:35.019 --> 01:16:37.489
You see, from what much you can see,

1920
01:16:37.489 --> 01:16:40.182
a patch about 20, 25 feet across or so

1921
01:16:40.182 --> 01:16:41.817
before the darkness takes it.

1922
01:16:41.817 --> 01:16:45.062
It looks like water, almost, but it's textured weird

1923
01:16:45.062 --> 01:16:46.749
and it's moving weird.

1924
01:16:46.749 --> 01:16:50.865
It's not moving like water. It's moving like tar or oil,

1925
01:16:50.865 --> 01:16:51.983
but it's not tar or oil.

1926
01:16:51.983 --> 01:16:53.487
You focus in more and you can see,

1927
01:16:53.487 --> 01:16:56.648
it looks like skin and flesh, moving against itself,

1928
01:16:56.648 --> 01:16:58.504
writhing and shifting.

1929
01:16:58.504 --> 01:17:02.086
You see eyes appear and move and then vanish within,

1930
01:17:02.086 --> 01:17:05.654
teeth and mouths spiraling in it before vanishing below.

1931
01:17:05.654 --> 01:17:10.221
It is a mass of skin and flesh and muscle

1932
01:17:10.221 --> 01:17:12.142
and teeth and mouths and eyes,

1933
01:17:12.142 --> 01:17:15.505
and you can hear the, (groaning) the noises

1934
01:17:15.505 --> 01:17:17.782
that are coming out of each of these dozens of mouths

1935
01:17:17.782 --> 01:17:21.266
that are just slightly shifting below.

1936
01:17:21.266 --> 01:17:23.654
You now know what fills this chasm.

1937
01:17:23.654 --> 01:17:26.934
I need you to make a wisdom saving throw for me.

1938
01:17:26.934 --> 01:17:28.777
SAM: Oh, wow, really good, 18.

1939
01:17:28.777 --> 01:17:29.680
MATT: 18.

1940
01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:32.198
You fight back the urge to scream at this sight,

1941
01:17:32.198 --> 01:17:34.137
and just cover your mouth.

1942
01:17:34.137 --> 01:17:37.419
Because you're small, I won't require a strength check.

1943
01:17:37.419 --> 01:17:39.938
You all slowly bring Nott back up onto the bridge.

1944
01:17:39.938 --> 01:17:41.728
TRAVIS: Do you know what those are?

1945
01:17:41.728 --> 01:17:44.054
SAM: I don't think I do.

1946
01:17:44.054 --> 01:17:47.667
But I know that it's gross and disgusting and scary.

1947
01:17:47.667 --> 01:17:51.084
I will, with my shortsword, cut the rope,

1948
01:17:52.505 --> 01:17:55.188
and walk to the back of the line.

1949
01:17:55.188 --> 01:17:56.455
MATT: Okay.

1950
01:17:56.455 --> 01:17:57.288
TRAVIS: Where are you going?

1951
01:17:57.288 --> 01:17:59.710
SAM: You guys can go first.

1952
01:17:59.710 --> 01:18:03.040
MARISHA: Do you want Caduceus to put you on his shoulders?

1953
01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:04.431
SAM: Nope.

1954
01:18:04.431 --> 01:18:06.659
TRAVIS: When the rocks fell, can I look up?

1955
01:18:06.659 --> 01:18:07.902
MATT: Yeah, make a perception check.

1956
01:18:07.902 --> 01:18:09.336
TRAVIS: That's not great.

1957
01:18:09.336 --> 01:18:10.981
Natural 20.

1958
01:18:10.981 --> 01:18:11.981
MATT: Holy shit!

1959
01:18:13.009 --> 01:18:15.391
TALIESIN: You are tying yourself back to somebody, right?

1960
01:18:15.391 --> 01:18:16.866
MATT: You look up and you can see

1961
01:18:16.866 --> 01:18:18.435
a little bit of the top of the cavern,

1962
01:18:18.435 --> 01:18:20.814
about 35 or so feet up,

1963
01:18:20.814 --> 01:18:23.312
and you can see among some of the stalactites

1964
01:18:23.312 --> 01:18:25.819
that are dangling down,

1965
01:18:25.819 --> 01:18:29.467
one of them is shifting close off to the side,

1966
01:18:29.467 --> 01:18:32.967
over close to above of where you guys are.

1967
01:18:34.667 --> 01:18:36.525
TRAVIS: Okay, guys, I don't want to freak you out.

1968
01:18:36.525 --> 01:18:40.423
There is something directly above us, about 35 feet,

1969
01:18:40.423 --> 01:18:42.401
that is tracking us on the ceiling.

1970
01:18:42.401 --> 01:18:43.781
MATT: You do still sense that magical aura

1971
01:18:43.781 --> 01:18:45.781
in that cage over there.

1972
01:18:46.626 --> 01:18:47.652
TALIESIN: We should probably move,

1973
01:18:47.652 --> 01:18:48.947
but there is a magic thing in that.

1974
01:18:48.947 --> 01:18:50.118
TRAVIS: Yeah, we got to get that thing.

1975
01:18:50.118 --> 01:18:50.968
TALIESIN: No, we don't.

1976
01:18:50.968 --> 01:18:51.980
SAM: Actually, you know what, Matt.

1977
01:18:51.980 --> 01:18:53.524
May I not move to the back of the line?

1978
01:18:53.524 --> 01:18:56.830
MATT: Yeah.
SAM: I'm going to just go.

1979
01:18:56.830 --> 01:18:57.663
Stealthily.

1980
01:18:57.663 --> 01:18:58.863
TRAVIS: What? You've got Mage Hand. You can go

1981
01:18:58.863 --> 01:19:00.548
get the thing out of the cage.

1982
01:19:00.548 --> 01:19:02.209
LIAM: She's gone, Fjord.

1983
01:19:02.209 --> 01:19:03.292
MATT: She's gone.

1984
01:19:05.297 --> 01:19:06.262
The rest of you moving forward?

1985
01:19:06.262 --> 01:19:07.095
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1986
01:19:07.095 --> 01:19:09.290
TRAVIS: But--
MATT: Stealth check for everybody.

1987
01:19:09.290 --> 01:19:10.540
TRAVIS: But the cage!

1988
01:19:11.887 --> 01:19:13.844
How far is the cage from the bridge?

1989
01:19:13.844 --> 01:19:15.090
MATT: It's about 20 or so feet.

1990
01:19:15.090 --> 01:19:16.846
TRAVIS: You know I can't resist this shit, you guys.

1991
01:19:16.846 --> 01:19:18.467
MARISHA: Natural 20.

1992
01:19:18.467 --> 01:19:19.751
LIAM: There's a cage over there?

1993
01:19:19.751 --> 01:19:21.159
TRAVIS: Yeah.
LIAM: Point towards the cage.

1994
01:19:21.159 --> 01:19:22.650
SAM: I am moving faster

1995
01:19:22.650 --> 01:19:24.678
than the rest.
LIAM: While Fjord is pointing,

1996
01:19:24.678 --> 01:19:27.879
I reconfigure, because I cannot see that well.

1997
01:19:27.879 --> 01:19:30.073
The globules start to make a chain

1998
01:19:30.073 --> 01:19:32.566
out in the direction that Fjord is pointing

1999
01:19:32.566 --> 01:19:33.659
so now I can see the cage.

2000
01:19:33.659 --> 01:19:35.572
MATT: As the orbs glimpse over you can now see the cage,

2001
01:19:35.572 --> 01:19:37.744
very faintly, like the soft, fire light around it.

2002
01:19:37.744 --> 01:19:40.200
LIAM: How close would you say it is to me?

2003
01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:42.598
MATT: Right here it's about 25 feet from you, 30 feet.

2004
01:19:42.598 --> 01:19:44.035
LIAM: (snaps) Frumpkin's in the cage.

2005
01:19:44.035 --> 01:19:45.920
MATT: All right, Frumpkin has appeared in the cage.

2006
01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:46.865
A vulture.

2007
01:19:46.865 --> 01:19:50.780
LIAM: No, wait, wait, wait. That might be wrong, actually.

2008
01:19:50.780 --> 01:19:53.262
Sorry, I don't think I can bamf him that close,

2009
01:19:53.262 --> 01:19:55.420
but I'm going to be sure.

2010
01:19:55.420 --> 01:19:57.103
TALIESIN: Good roll.

2011
01:19:57.103 --> 01:19:58.940
MATT: Stealth checks, anyway. So we have?

2012
01:19:58.940 --> 01:20:00.635
MARISHA: Natural 20.
MATT: Right.

2013
01:20:00.635 --> 01:20:01.468
Fjord?

2014
01:20:05.684 --> 01:20:08.425
TRAVIS: 16 for Fjord, 31 for Jester.

2015
01:20:08.425 --> 01:20:10.709
MATT: All right.
SAM: 28.

2016
01:20:12.030 --> 01:20:14.273
TALIESIN: That's a 30.
ASHLEY: 21.

2017
01:20:14.273 --> 01:20:17.225
LIAM: 29 and I <i>can</i> make him appear in that cage.

2018
01:20:17.225 --> 01:20:22.225
MATT: All right, so Frumpkin, now in vulture form,

2019
01:20:22.363 --> 01:20:25.714
manages to apparate within the cage

2020
01:20:25.714 --> 01:20:27.219
and next to the two corpses.

2021
01:20:27.219 --> 01:20:30.810
Frumpkin now has to hold onto the side of the cage.

2022
01:20:30.810 --> 01:20:31.670
Being a vulture--

2023
01:20:31.670 --> 01:20:33.434
LIAM: He's not inside the cage?

2024
01:20:33.434 --> 01:20:35.229
MATT: No, I mean inside the cage, though.

2025
01:20:35.229 --> 01:20:37.086
The floor is two corpses.

2026
01:20:37.086 --> 01:20:38.344
Where's Frumpkin going to land?

2027
01:20:38.344 --> 01:20:40.810
LIAM: Right on top of one of the corpse's heads.

2028
01:20:40.810 --> 01:20:42.569
MATT: Okay. (cracking)

2029
01:20:42.569 --> 01:20:43.837
LIAM: I don't need to look through him,

2030
01:20:43.837 --> 01:20:46.232
because I can see him. I telepathically instruct him

2031
01:20:46.232 --> 01:20:49.890
to try to pick at the bag and open it and look in.

2032
01:20:49.890 --> 01:20:51.801
Pull out whatever is in there.

2033
01:20:51.801 --> 01:20:52.634
MATT: Okay, so you're giving this instruction

2034
01:20:52.634 --> 01:20:53.467
as you guys move?

2035
01:20:53.467 --> 01:20:54.577
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: All right.

2036
01:20:54.577 --> 01:20:57.582
Moving forward, Frumpkin rummages through,

2037
01:20:57.582 --> 01:21:00.805
the body collapses, the armor (cracking),

2038
01:21:00.805 --> 01:21:04.722
which makes some noise as the body itself folds over.

2039
01:21:05.777 --> 01:21:08.002
The voices begin to rise up from the sound

2040
01:21:08.002 --> 01:21:10.186
made from that. However, Frumpkin does pull inside

2041
01:21:10.186 --> 01:21:13.347
and see a tightly bound piece of cord,

2042
01:21:13.347 --> 01:21:15.343
like thick cording on the inside of the bag.

2043
01:21:15.343 --> 01:21:17.426
LIAM: Cording?
MATT: Cording, yes.

2044
01:21:19.932 --> 01:21:21.657
I need everybody to roll initiative.

2045
01:21:21.657 --> 01:21:23.240
SAM: Initiative?

2046
01:21:24.621 --> 01:21:26.912
LIAM: Yasha, 1d8 added to your initiative roll.

2047
01:21:26.912 --> 01:21:28.220
LIAM: 1d8 added to it, okay.

2048
01:21:28.220 --> 01:21:30.769
SAM: Oh, what the fuck is that?

2049
01:21:30.769 --> 01:21:34.471
MATT: This is the roper that is above you.

2050
01:21:34.471 --> 01:21:36.413
That has-- from the noise you've been making,

2051
01:21:36.413 --> 01:21:38.794
it's slowly making its way over to meet you on the bridge,

2052
01:21:38.794 --> 01:21:42.413
and it's now going to attempt to eat.

2053
01:21:42.413 --> 01:21:45.931
SAM: I would-- would I be, Matthew, just a little further

2054
01:21:45.931 --> 01:21:50.363
ahead than the rest, since I've disengaged from them and--?

2055
01:21:50.363 --> 01:21:51.512
LIAM: You are so fast.

2056
01:21:51.512 --> 01:21:53.271
MATT: If you want to, sure.

2057
01:21:53.271 --> 01:21:54.891
SAM: Yes, thank you.

2058
01:21:54.891 --> 01:21:56.911
MATT: I'll put you there.

2059
01:21:56.911 --> 01:21:58.342
Although, you're still moving stealthily,

2060
01:21:58.342 --> 01:22:00.870
so you're five feet ahead. Right?

2061
01:22:00.870 --> 01:22:01.883
SAM: Sure.

2062
01:22:01.883 --> 01:22:02.841
MATT: Well, then, no, because you can use your disengage

2063
01:22:02.841 --> 01:22:04.118
to move as well.
SAM: Yeah.

2064
01:22:04.118 --> 01:22:07.515
MATT: So I'll put you up there.

2065
01:22:07.515 --> 01:22:10.446
All right, so first off, beginning of the combat round,

2066
01:22:10.446 --> 01:22:12.067
I need everybody to make a wisdom saving throw

2067
01:22:12.067 --> 01:22:14.895
from the sound of Frumpkin rummaging through the body.

2068
01:22:14.895 --> 01:22:18.406
The whispers now begin to (loud whispering).

2069
01:22:18.406 --> 01:22:21.085
LIAM: Does the cat need to do that or is he exempt?

2070
01:22:21.085 --> 01:22:22.538
TRAVIS: Come on!
MARISHA: Fuck!

2071
01:22:22.538 --> 01:22:24.903
MATT: So Fjord?
TRAVIS: Negative one.

2072
01:22:24.903 --> 01:22:29.003
(laughter)
MATT: Beauregard?

2073
01:22:29.003 --> 01:22:30.618
MARISHA: Six.
LIAM: 15.

2074
01:22:30.618 --> 01:22:33.061
SAM: 12.

2075
01:22:33.061 --> 01:22:35.038
TALIESIN: 26.
ASHLEY: One.

2076
01:22:35.038 --> 01:22:36.672
LIAM: It's just you and me, Cad!

2077
01:22:36.672 --> 01:22:38.431
Wait, Jester. How did Jester do?

2078
01:22:38.431 --> 01:22:39.264
Muscle woman.

2079
01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:43.158
SAM: She went to sleep 15 minutes ago.

2080
01:22:43.158 --> 01:22:44.120
TRAVIS: 24.

2081
01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:45.663
MATT: All right, so.

2082
01:22:45.663 --> 01:22:50.159
So Fjord, Beauregard, Yasha.

2083
01:22:50.159 --> 01:22:51.997
The three of you guys.

2084
01:22:51.997 --> 01:22:54.121
When we come to your turn, we'll see what you're doing.

2085
01:22:54.121 --> 01:22:55.529
First, initiative rolls.

2086
01:22:55.529 --> 01:22:57.504
So 25 to 20?

2087
01:22:58.515 --> 01:23:00.531
TALIESIN: Oh, uh, no.

2088
01:23:01.857 --> 01:23:03.565
MATT: 25 to 20, anybody?

2089
01:23:03.565 --> 01:23:06.014
All right. 19 to 15?

2090
01:23:06.014 --> 01:23:07.831
MARISHA: 19.
TALIESIN: 18.

2091
01:23:07.831 --> 01:23:09.297
LIAM: Low roll?

2092
01:23:09.297 --> 01:23:10.964
SAM: 15 for young Nott.

2093
01:23:11.801 --> 01:23:14.647
LIAM: High for Pike.
SAM: Got anything over there, Travis?

2094
01:23:14.647 --> 01:23:16.078
MATT: 15 to 10?

2095
01:23:16.078 --> 01:23:17.347
TRAVIS: 11 for Jester.

2096
01:23:17.347 --> 01:23:18.628
ASHLEY: 13.

2097
01:23:18.628 --> 01:23:20.672
Lucky, lucky 13.

2098
01:23:20.672 --> 01:23:22.669
SAM: With advantage?
ASHLEY: With a d8.

2099
01:23:22.669 --> 01:23:24.896
SAM: Oh, the plus eight, I mean.

2100
01:23:24.896 --> 01:23:25.946
LIAM: Wow.

2101
01:23:27.552 --> 01:23:29.592
MATT: Fjord?
TRAVIS: Eight.

2102
01:23:29.592 --> 01:23:31.359
MATT: And?
LIAM: Four.

2103
01:23:31.359 --> 01:23:32.676
MATT: All right.

2104
01:23:32.676 --> 01:23:33.517
TRAVIS: Fuck.

2105
01:23:33.517 --> 01:23:34.350
LIAM: Rolled a two.

2106
01:23:35.321 --> 01:23:36.154
SAM: <i>Nein.</i>

2107
01:23:37.328 --> 01:23:39.554
MATT: So top of the round it is Beau and the roper,

2108
01:23:39.554 --> 01:23:41.788
who rolled a natural 20 on its initiative.

2109
01:23:41.788 --> 01:23:43.106
Minus one.

2110
01:23:44.456 --> 01:23:46.064
MARISHA: With a minus one.

2111
01:23:46.064 --> 01:23:47.812
MATT: Yes, but you do have a higher dexterity to it,

2112
01:23:47.812 --> 01:23:48.645
because it actually has a dexterity of eight,

2113
01:23:48.645 --> 01:23:50.460
so you actually go right before it.

2114
01:23:50.460 --> 01:23:51.445
Take your turn.

2115
01:23:51.445 --> 01:23:52.806
LIAM: Multiple tentacles.

2116
01:23:52.806 --> 01:23:54.381
TRAVIS: No, like, petrification?

2117
01:23:54.381 --> 01:23:57.924
LIAM: No, but they grapple like a motherfuck.

2118
01:23:57.924 --> 01:23:59.132
We've fought these things already.

2119
01:23:59.132 --> 01:24:00.679
MATT: Yep.

2120
01:24:00.679 --> 01:24:02.309
MARISHA: In the cavern.

2121
01:24:02.309 --> 01:24:05.532
The one where Jester tried to paint a Traveler.

2122
01:24:05.532 --> 01:24:07.615
TRAVIS: Yep, wang.
MARISHA: Yes, thing.

2123
01:24:08.999 --> 01:24:10.981
MATT: Beau, what are you doing?

2124
01:24:10.981 --> 01:24:13.359
MARISHA: I failed my wisdom save.

2125
01:24:13.359 --> 01:24:14.754
MATT: That's right. Thank you for the reminder.

2126
01:24:14.754 --> 01:24:15.878
MARISHA: Yeah.

2127
01:24:15.878 --> 01:24:17.870
MATT: You...

2128
01:24:17.870 --> 01:24:18.828
do nothing.

2129
01:24:18.828 --> 01:24:20.306
You spend your turn just--

2130
01:24:20.306 --> 01:24:21.652
MARISHA: Staring.
MATT: Just staring.

2131
01:24:21.652 --> 01:24:24.295
You notice the creature and then the voices come in.

2132
01:24:24.295 --> 01:24:25.973
You try and go-- and before your hands

2133
01:24:25.973 --> 01:24:28.160
can even get to your ears, your hands just drop.

2134
01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:29.992
That's your turn.

2135
01:24:29.992 --> 01:24:31.402
That brings us to the roper's turn.

2136
01:24:31.402 --> 01:24:34.833
The roper is going to use four tendril attacks.

2137
01:24:34.833 --> 01:24:35.944
TRAVIS: Oh, four?!

2138
01:24:35.944 --> 01:24:37.169
MATT: Yep.

2139
01:24:37.169 --> 01:24:38.697
TRAVIS: How about two?

2140
01:24:38.697 --> 01:24:41.736
MATT: So first one's going to be against you, Yasha.

2141
01:24:41.736 --> 01:24:43.059
MARISHA: Just negotiate [inaudible].

2142
01:24:43.059 --> 01:24:44.713
MATT: Cocked.

2143
01:24:44.713 --> 01:24:46.460
It's going to be 14 to hit?

2144
01:24:46.460 --> 01:24:47.343
ASHLEY: No.

2145
01:24:47.343 --> 01:24:48.464
MATT: That's right, because you're armor class 15 now.

2146
01:24:48.464 --> 01:24:49.297
ASHLEY: Yeah.

2147
01:24:49.297 --> 01:24:51.789
MATT: So that tendril just whips down towards you

2148
01:24:51.789 --> 01:24:53.713
and you just take your sword and parry to the side

2149
01:24:53.713 --> 01:24:55.271
and it withdraws.

2150
01:24:55.271 --> 01:24:59.581
Next one's going to go for Beauregard, who's not moving.

2151
01:24:59.581 --> 01:25:01.468
That's going to be 21 to hit?

2152
01:25:01.468 --> 01:25:02.400
MARISHA: Yeah.

2153
01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:03.452
MATT: All right.

2154
01:25:03.452 --> 01:25:05.451
You are grappled.

2155
01:25:05.451 --> 01:25:06.752
MARISHA: Okay.

2156
01:25:06.752 --> 01:25:08.650
MATT: So I'm just going to mark that there.

2157
01:25:08.650 --> 01:25:10.476
TRAVIS: I'm sorry, does it stay up 35 feet above us,

2158
01:25:10.476 --> 01:25:11.933
or is it lowering itself down at all?

2159
01:25:11.933 --> 01:25:13.916
MATT: It's 35 feet up.
TRAVIS: Okay.

2160
01:25:13.916 --> 01:25:15.627
TALIESIN: 35 feet up?
MATT: Yes.

2161
01:25:15.627 --> 01:25:16.771
TALIESIN: Oh no.

2162
01:25:16.771 --> 01:25:18.704
TRAVIS: That is a long fucking reach.

2163
01:25:18.704 --> 01:25:20.055
SAM: This is already, by the way,

2164
01:25:20.055 --> 01:25:22.426
This is a fucking amazing encounter.

2165
01:25:22.426 --> 01:25:23.259
LIAM: Yeah!

2166
01:25:24.256 --> 01:25:26.902
SAM: Every time we move, I assume we're going to make noise,

2167
01:25:26.902 --> 01:25:29.172
and I assume we're going to have to roll for that fucking--.

2168
01:25:29.172 --> 01:25:30.697
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

2169
01:25:31.822 --> 01:25:33.181
MATT: All right.
TRAVIS: Damn it, Matt.

2170
01:25:33.181 --> 01:25:34.797
MATT: Caduceus.

2171
01:25:34.797 --> 01:25:36.460
TRAVIS: We should've just run across this motherfucker.

2172
01:25:36.460 --> 01:25:39.509
MATT: You can see the one tendril wrap around Beauregard

2173
01:25:39.509 --> 01:25:41.206
and start to lift her up

2174
01:25:41.206 --> 01:25:43.270
with the rope attached to everybody.

2175
01:25:43.270 --> 01:25:44.218
TALIESIN: Okay.

2176
01:25:44.218 --> 01:25:46.612
He's 30 feet away?

2177
01:25:46.612 --> 01:25:48.195
MATT: 35 feet up, yeah.

2178
01:25:49.235 --> 01:25:52.743
TALIESIN: I'm going to use Command

2179
01:25:52.743 --> 01:25:55.586
on the creature.

2180
01:25:55.586 --> 01:25:56.506
SAM: That'd be cool.
MATT: All right,

2181
01:25:56.506 --> 01:25:58.604
what are you going to Command it to do?

2182
01:25:58.604 --> 01:26:00.418
Wait, double checking on Command.

2183
01:26:00.418 --> 01:26:01.618
Command.

2184
01:26:03.213 --> 01:26:06.027
SAM: It says, "creature you can see within range."

2185
01:26:06.027 --> 01:26:07.895
MATT: Has to understand your language.

2186
01:26:07.895 --> 01:26:08.771
TALIESIN: Oh, it's--

2187
01:26:08.771 --> 01:26:10.335
because it's not a--

2188
01:26:10.335 --> 01:26:11.168
MATT: You're not sure if this creature understands

2189
01:26:11.168 --> 01:26:12.276
your language, just so you know.

2190
01:26:12.276 --> 01:26:13.358
TALIESIN: Oh.
MATT: You can attempt it or not.

2191
01:26:13.358 --> 01:26:15.271
You're uncertain if it can.

2192
01:26:15.271 --> 01:26:18.407
TALIESIN: Most things can understand me, though.

2193
01:26:18.407 --> 01:26:19.301
MATT: True.

2194
01:26:19.301 --> 01:26:20.517
TALIESIN: Because I have that power.

2195
01:26:20.517 --> 01:26:22.551
MATT: You do. Okay, so you cast it?

2196
01:26:22.551 --> 01:26:23.453
You're telling, what are you telling?

2197
01:26:23.453 --> 01:26:25.167
What's the command you're giving it?

2198
01:26:25.167 --> 01:26:27.233
TALIESIN: Let go.
MATT: Okay.

2199
01:26:28.093 --> 01:26:30.022
Read to me specifically the ability you have.

2200
01:26:30.022 --> 01:26:31.289
TALIESIN: I speak a one word command.

2201
01:26:31.289 --> 01:26:32.949
Oh, like, yeah, so.

2202
01:26:32.949 --> 01:26:34.304
MATT: The ability you have as a firbolg.

2203
01:26:34.304 --> 01:26:36.231
TALIESIN: As a firbolg? Oh no.

2204
01:26:36.231 --> 01:26:40.438
I have a funny feeling that you have caught me into a thing.

2205
01:26:40.438 --> 01:26:42.015
Here we are.

2206
01:26:42.015 --> 01:26:44.030
You can communicate with, though not understand,

2207
01:26:44.030 --> 01:26:46.040
beasts and plants and have an advantage on charisma checks

2208
01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:46.903
to influence them.

2209
01:26:46.903 --> 01:26:48.908
MATT: Yeah. It doesn't seem to affect the creature.

2210
01:26:48.908 --> 01:26:49.791
TALIESIN: All right.

2211
01:26:49.791 --> 01:26:51.215
Burned a spell.

2212
01:26:51.215 --> 01:26:52.519
MATT: That's your action.

2213
01:26:52.519 --> 01:26:53.493
You can still move if you want.

2214
01:26:53.493 --> 01:26:54.637
You can move 15 feet from the people

2215
01:26:54.637 --> 01:26:56.352
you are currently tied to, if you need to,

2216
01:26:56.352 --> 01:26:57.505
or you can stay put.

2217
01:26:57.505 --> 01:27:01.955
TALIESIN: I'm going to stay put.

2218
01:27:01.955 --> 01:27:04.676
MATT: Okay, Caduceus, you end your turn.

2219
01:27:04.676 --> 01:27:06.488
TALIESIN: Or, I'll move 15 feet forward.

2220
01:27:06.488 --> 01:27:09.118
I'll move 15 feet as far forward as I can,

2221
01:27:09.118 --> 01:27:10.747
so that we can all move.

2222
01:27:10.747 --> 01:27:12.222
MATT: That's as far as you can. That's 15 feet from Fjord

2223
01:27:12.222 --> 01:27:13.346
before you go taut there.

2224
01:27:13.346 --> 01:27:14.420
Actually, the roper technically

2225
01:27:14.420 --> 01:27:16.610
has two more tentacle attacks I was going to use.

2226
01:27:16.610 --> 01:27:18.127
TALIESIN: Oh, well, you would have done that before I did

2227
01:27:18.127 --> 01:27:20.609
that.
MATT: Right, so I'll just run this way.

2228
01:27:20.609 --> 01:27:23.661
One against Caleb.
That's a 20 to hit?

2229
01:27:23.661 --> 01:27:25.472
LIAM: Yes.
MATT: Okay.

2230
01:27:25.472 --> 01:27:27.719
You are grappled.
LIAM: Okay.

2231
01:27:27.719 --> 01:27:29.422
MATT: Then, against--

2232
01:27:29.422 --> 01:27:30.775
LIAM: Lifted or just held in place where--

2233
01:27:30.775 --> 01:27:32.597
MATT: Currently just held in place.
LIAM: Okay.

2234
01:27:32.597 --> 01:27:36.698
MATT: Then against Fjord, that is a 22 to hit?

2235
01:27:36.698 --> 01:27:38.898
TRAVIS: Hits.
MATT: You are grappled as well.

2236
01:27:38.898 --> 01:27:41.073
TRAVIS: Can I make a strength check

2237
01:27:41.073 --> 01:27:43.762
with my pissy ass muscles?

2238
01:27:43.762 --> 01:27:45.136
MATT: On your turn you can.

2239
01:27:45.136 --> 01:27:46.745
It's now going to use Reel,

2240
01:27:46.745 --> 01:27:50.674
which pulls every creature grappled to it by 25 feet up.

2241
01:27:50.674 --> 01:27:52.058
TRAVIS: 25?!

2242
01:27:52.058 --> 01:27:53.241
MATT: As you try and cast Command,

2243
01:27:53.241 --> 01:27:55.081
you're watching your friends being lifted up.

2244
01:27:55.081 --> 01:27:57.431
You run aside and the rope goes taut.

2245
01:27:57.431 --> 01:28:02.373
TALIESIN: Do I have a reaction to try and grab onto the...

2246
01:28:05.100 --> 01:28:06.125
MATT: To the?

2247
01:28:06.125 --> 01:28:07.481
TALIESIN: To the bridge?

2248
01:28:07.481 --> 01:28:08.314
MATT: Yeah.

2249
01:28:09.497 --> 01:28:12.106
Now you watch as Fjord--

2250
01:28:14.304 --> 01:28:17.685
SAM: So there's only 15 feet of rope?

2251
01:28:17.685 --> 01:28:18.518
MATT: Correct.

2252
01:28:18.518 --> 01:28:22.784
So everybody is now currently daisy chained, hanging up.

2253
01:28:22.784 --> 01:28:24.606
LIAM: ♪ Together at last ♪

2254
01:28:24.606 --> 01:28:27.107
LIAM and ASHLEY: ♪ Together forever ♪

2255
01:28:27.107 --> 01:28:28.058
TRAVIS: Can I ask a question?

2256
01:28:28.058 --> 01:28:28.891
MATT: Correct.

2257
01:28:28.891 --> 01:28:30.857
TRAVIS: Can we see the other side of this bridge yet,

2258
01:28:30.857 --> 01:28:32.735
like is it still out of sight?

2259
01:28:32.735 --> 01:28:34.156
TALIESIN: Our vision's terrible.

2260
01:28:34.156 --> 01:28:35.283
MATT: Your guys' vision's really bad.

2261
01:28:35.283 --> 01:28:37.554
So Caduceus, you get pulled in there,

2262
01:28:37.554 --> 01:28:39.899
and you are now dangling there as you--

2263
01:28:39.899 --> 01:28:41.940
TALIESIN: Hey, but I'm now 30 feet away from it?

2264
01:28:41.940 --> 01:28:42.804
MATT: You are.
TALIESIN: Cool.

2265
01:28:42.804 --> 01:28:45.363
ASHLEY: ♪ It's a hard knock life for us ♪

2266
01:28:45.363 --> 01:28:46.879
MATT: So you guys are now this dangling

2267
01:28:46.879 --> 01:28:49.170
Christmas light chain.

2268
01:28:49.170 --> 01:28:53.551
(groaning)
MATT: As Nott's running away.

2269
01:28:53.551 --> 01:28:55.557
LIAM: Matt, did you think this through?

2270
01:28:55.557 --> 01:28:56.390
MATT: Yeah, I did.

2271
01:28:56.390 --> 01:28:57.363
LIAM: Oh no.

2272
01:28:57.363 --> 01:28:59.632
ASHLEY: That'll make us heavier.

2273
01:28:59.632 --> 01:29:00.586
For the thing.
MATT: Nott, it's your turn.

2274
01:29:00.586 --> 01:29:01.914
SAM: It's my turn?

2275
01:29:01.914 --> 01:29:04.025
MATT: You hear this noise now, behind.

2276
01:29:04.025 --> 01:29:04.858
SAM: I turn around.

2277
01:29:04.858 --> 01:29:09.024
I see all my friends dangling, holy shit.

2278
01:29:09.024 --> 01:29:10.866
(laughter)

2279
01:29:10.866 --> 01:29:12.816
The things that are lifting them up

2280
01:29:12.816 --> 01:29:14.123
are thick-ass tentacles,

2281
01:29:14.123 --> 01:29:16.184
not thin-ass ropes, right?

2282
01:29:16.184 --> 01:29:20.147
MATT: They're about, maybe like four to five inches across.

2283
01:29:20.147 --> 01:29:21.521
So they're pretty thick.

2284
01:29:21.521 --> 01:29:22.958
SAM: I have darkvision, 60 feet,

2285
01:29:22.958 --> 01:29:24.404
but you say that that's cut in half.

2286
01:29:24.404 --> 01:29:26.343
MATT: Cut in 30, so right now you can barely even see,

2287
01:29:26.343 --> 01:29:29.817
like tendrils moving and your friends being pulled up

2288
01:29:29.817 --> 01:29:33.453
on a daisy chain.
SAM: Oh boy.

2289
01:29:33.453 --> 01:29:35.039
Oh boy.

2290
01:29:35.039 --> 01:29:37.321
(laughter)
TRAVIS: This is what we live for!

2291
01:29:37.321 --> 01:29:39.035
Right now!

2292
01:29:39.035 --> 01:29:40.645
We're so fucked!

2293
01:29:40.645 --> 01:29:41.795
SAM: I'm going to turn back

2294
01:29:41.795 --> 01:29:44.804
and come back towards them my 15 feet.

2295
01:29:44.804 --> 01:29:46.318
MATT: All right, stealthily?

2296
01:29:46.318 --> 01:29:47.318
SAM: No.
MATT: Okay.

2297
01:29:49.314 --> 01:29:51.560
TRAVIS: Save yourself, Nott!

2298
01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:53.060
I don't yell that.

2299
01:29:54.438 --> 01:29:57.056
SAM: I'm going to shoot for the rope.

2300
01:29:57.056 --> 01:29:58.853
The rope that is tied to Jester.

2301
01:29:58.853 --> 01:30:00.227
Between Jester and Beau.

2302
01:30:00.227 --> 01:30:02.576
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll an attack.

2303
01:30:02.576 --> 01:30:05.025
SAM: That's a natural one.

2304
01:30:05.025 --> 01:30:08.538
TALIESIN: That would drop everyone into the fucking chasm.

2305
01:30:08.538 --> 01:30:10.211
MATT: So you go to fire and it misfires.

2306
01:30:10.211 --> 01:30:11.235
Make an attack on yourself.

2307
01:30:11.235 --> 01:30:12.977
SAM: That's true, Tinkertop Boltblaster--

2308
01:30:12.977 --> 01:30:15.779
TALIESIN: Thank god you didn't just murder half the group.

2309
01:30:15.779 --> 01:30:17.699
SAM: I succeed on dexterity saving throw.

2310
01:30:17.699 --> 01:30:21.182
MATT: Technically, you guys aren't being dangled in this.

2311
01:30:21.182 --> 01:30:23.249
You guys are technically still over the bridge,

2312
01:30:23.249 --> 01:30:24.328
because it moved right above you

2313
01:30:24.328 --> 01:30:25.459
and is pulling you up towards it.

2314
01:30:25.459 --> 01:30:27.007
TRAVIS: Up above the bridge-ish?
MATT: Correct.

2315
01:30:27.007 --> 01:30:28.024
Mind you, still falling

2316
01:30:28.024 --> 01:30:30.591
would involve a possible chance of plummeting off the side.

2317
01:30:30.591 --> 01:30:33.151
SAM: I failed my dexterity roll.
MATT: Okay.

2318
01:30:33.151 --> 01:30:34.949
TALIESIN: Cutting the rope would be bad.

2319
01:30:34.949 --> 01:30:37.024
SAM: So I suffer four points of piercing damage.

2320
01:30:37.024 --> 01:30:38.780
MATT: You take four points of piercing damage to yourself.

2321
01:30:38.780 --> 01:30:41.586
SAM: Is that-- do I still get a bonus action,

2322
01:30:41.586 --> 01:30:43.399
or is that the bonus action?

2323
01:30:43.399 --> 01:30:44.366
MATT: No, that's just your action.

2324
01:30:44.366 --> 01:30:45.532
You still have a bonus action.

2325
01:30:45.532 --> 01:30:47.012
SAM: I will fire again at that rope.

2326
01:30:47.012 --> 01:30:49.263
MATT: Go for it. Roll again.

2327
01:30:49.263 --> 01:30:52.666
SAM: This time I shoot a 24 to hit.

2328
01:30:52.666 --> 01:30:53.555
MATT: That definitely hits the rope.

2329
01:30:53.555 --> 01:30:54.485
Go ahead and roll for damage

2330
01:30:54.485 --> 01:30:55.917
to see if it's enough to snap it.

2331
01:30:55.917 --> 01:30:57.193
SAM: I assume I don't have sneak attack on the rope.

2332
01:30:57.193 --> 01:31:00.318
MATT: You do not. It does not have a discernible anatomy.

2333
01:31:00.318 --> 01:31:01.786
TRAVIS: He's shooting the rope.

2334
01:31:01.786 --> 01:31:04.321
SAM: 10 points of damage on the rope.

2335
01:31:04.321 --> 01:31:06.668
MATT: The one between Beau and Jester?

2336
01:31:06.668 --> 01:31:08.572
SAM: Beau and Jester.
(slicing)

2337
01:31:08.572 --> 01:31:09.405
MATT: The rope shatters.

2338
01:31:09.405 --> 01:31:12.829
Yasha, you watch as Jester begins to plummet down

2339
01:31:12.829 --> 01:31:15.061
about ten feet or so, towards the bridge.

2340
01:31:15.061 --> 01:31:16.168
On the bridge.

2341
01:31:16.168 --> 01:31:17.257
(thudding)

2342
01:31:17.257 --> 01:31:22.240
Go ahead and roll a dexterity saving throw for Jester,

2343
01:31:23.190 --> 01:31:25.283
who does suffer three points of bludgeoning damage

2344
01:31:25.283 --> 01:31:26.965
from hitting the bridge top.

2345
01:31:26.965 --> 01:31:28.280
TRAVIS: 16.
MATT: 16?

2346
01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:29.498
She doesn't tumble off the side of the bridge.

2347
01:31:29.498 --> 01:31:30.591
Catches herself.

2348
01:31:30.591 --> 01:31:32.376
Now it's just Yasha and Jester tethered together.

2349
01:31:32.376 --> 01:31:34.233
It does make a loud (thudding) noise

2350
01:31:34.233 --> 01:31:36.212
as she impacts the bridge.

2351
01:31:36.212 --> 01:31:37.487
Now it's just them tethered up there

2352
01:31:37.487 --> 01:31:38.621
and being held by the creature

2353
01:31:38.621 --> 01:31:43.588
and Caduceus dangling between Fjord and Caleb.

2354
01:31:43.588 --> 01:31:44.421
All right.

2355
01:31:44.421 --> 01:31:45.645
That finishes your turn, Nott.

2356
01:31:45.645 --> 01:31:47.373
SAM: Yep.
MATT: Yasha, you're up.

2357
01:31:47.373 --> 01:31:48.763
ASHLEY: Fuck.

2358
01:31:48.763 --> 01:31:50.375
MATT: Jester's right there and you catch her

2359
01:31:50.375 --> 01:31:51.728
and help get her back on her feet.

2360
01:31:51.728 --> 01:31:52.561
ASHLEY: I failed the saving throw.

2361
01:31:52.561 --> 01:31:53.394
The wisdom saving throw.

2362
01:31:53.394 --> 01:31:54.227
MATT: Oh you did, that's right.

2363
01:31:54.227 --> 01:31:55.444
Thank you for the reminder.

2364
01:31:55.444 --> 01:31:56.824
SAM: If I have any movement, I'll move back.
MATT: Okay.

2365
01:31:56.824 --> 01:31:58.561
TRAVIS: Where's Caduceus?

2366
01:31:58.561 --> 01:32:00.648
MATT: You do nothing.

2367
01:32:00.648 --> 01:32:02.672
You go to help Yasha and

2368
01:32:02.672 --> 01:32:06.660
your vision slowly drifts off and out into the darkness.

2369
01:32:06.660 --> 01:32:08.507
Your turn is done.

2370
01:32:08.507 --> 01:32:10.335
Jester's go.

2371
01:32:10.335 --> 01:32:11.445
TRAVIS: All right.

2372
01:32:11.445 --> 01:32:12.822
Jester would like to

2373
01:32:12.822 --> 01:32:16.574
look up at the creature and cast Banishment.

2374
01:32:16.574 --> 01:32:18.839
SAM: Ooh!
MATT: Okay!

2375
01:32:18.839 --> 01:32:20.756
TRAVIS: That's what she says.

2376
01:32:21.993 --> 01:32:24.944
MATT: What's the save on that? Is it wisdom?

2377
01:32:24.944 --> 01:32:28.694
TRAVIS: Well, fucking scrolling, for Christ's sake.

2378
01:32:29.583 --> 01:32:32.084
MARISHA: If I remember, from Keyleth, I think it is.

2379
01:32:32.084 --> 01:32:35.465
LIAM: Tethered to this bridge by Yasha and rope, correct?

2380
01:32:35.465 --> 01:32:38.572
SAM: Yasha and Jester are no longer tethered--

2381
01:32:38.572 --> 01:32:40.550
TALIESIN: We are not, we are just--

2382
01:32:40.550 --> 01:32:42.646
SAM: No, Yasha is tethered to Jester.

2383
01:32:42.646 --> 01:32:44.312
MATT: Correct.

2384
01:32:44.312 --> 01:32:46.778
All right, so what is it?
TRAVIS: Charisma 17.

2385
01:32:48.508 --> 01:32:52.558
MATT: That is going to be a 12, minus two.

2386
01:32:52.558 --> 01:32:54.223
That is a fail.

2387
01:32:54.223 --> 01:32:55.389
LIAM: Here we go.

2388
01:32:55.389 --> 01:32:58.382
MATT: Pops out of existence.

2389
01:32:58.382 --> 01:32:59.928
The tethers vanish.

2390
01:32:59.928 --> 01:33:03.432
The four of you (thudding).

2391
01:33:03.432 --> 01:33:04.370
MARISHA: Onto the bridge?

2392
01:33:04.370 --> 01:33:05.203
MATT: You are no longer grappled.

2393
01:33:05.203 --> 01:33:06.361
LIAM: We're off the side of the bridge.

2394
01:33:06.361 --> 01:33:07.918
TALIESIN: No, we're right on top.

2395
01:33:07.918 --> 01:33:09.133
MATT: You guys are above the bridge.

2396
01:33:09.133 --> 01:33:11.034
LIAM: It was approximate.

2397
01:33:11.034 --> 01:33:14.534
SAM: It's not like a-- it's still a thin--

2398
01:33:14.534 --> 01:33:16.384
MARISHA: Oh my god.

2399
01:33:17.318 --> 01:33:19.458
MATT: Fall to that side. Caduceus as well.

2400
01:33:19.458 --> 01:33:21.171
LIAM: I thought we were five to ten feet

2401
01:33:21.171 --> 01:33:22.054
over.
TALIESIN: No, no, no.

2402
01:33:22.054 --> 01:33:23.784
That would've been--
LIAM: Yeah, that've been bad.

2403
01:33:23.784 --> 01:33:26.389
MATT: That would've been really bad.

2404
01:33:26.389 --> 01:33:27.756
So--
SAM: The bridge.

2405
01:33:27.756 --> 01:33:28.779
The bridge is fine?

2406
01:33:28.779 --> 01:33:31.159
It doesn't break or anything? We're good?

2407
01:33:31.159 --> 01:33:31.992
MATT: Beau, there's no wall to

2408
01:33:31.992 --> 01:33:32.825
slow your fall, unfortunately.

2409
01:33:33.981 --> 01:33:35.283
MARISHA: That's fine.

2410
01:33:35.283 --> 01:33:36.710
MATT: You take one point of bludgeoning damage.

2411
01:33:36.710 --> 01:33:38.241
SAM: Oh no.

2412
01:33:38.241 --> 01:33:39.081
MATT: Caleb.

2413
01:33:39.081 --> 01:33:40.330
MARISHA: I don't know, guys. (pained inhale)

2414
01:33:40.330 --> 01:33:42.506
SAM: Death saves.

2415
01:33:42.506 --> 01:33:43.339
MATT: Actually, it would've been six total,

2416
01:33:43.339 --> 01:33:44.965
because it was 2d6 for your fall.

2417
01:33:44.965 --> 01:33:46.881
Caleb, you also take seven points of bludgeoning damage--

2418
01:33:46.881 --> 01:33:48.713
LIAM: I'm unconscious.

2419
01:33:48.713 --> 01:33:49.958
MATT: Fjord, you take six points of bludgeoning damage.

2420
01:33:49.958 --> 01:33:51.253
TRAVIS: Okay, thank you.

2421
01:33:51.253 --> 01:33:52.792
MATT: I need you all to make dexterity saving throws,

2422
01:33:52.792 --> 01:33:54.557
and Caduceus, you didn't fall far enough--

2423
01:33:54.557 --> 01:33:57.180
TALIESIN: Oh, classy.
MATT: --to take damage.

2424
01:33:57.180 --> 01:33:59.319
SAM: Dexterity saving throws.

2425
01:33:59.319 --> 01:34:00.372
Those guys who fell?

2426
01:34:00.372 --> 01:34:01.252
MATT: Yes.

2427
01:34:01.252 --> 01:34:03.033
TRAVIS: 14.
MARISHA: 15.

2428
01:34:03.033 --> 01:34:04.033
LIAM: Oh my god.

2429
01:34:05.223 --> 01:34:06.481
19.
SAM: Wow.

2430
01:34:06.481 --> 01:34:07.634
TALIESIN: 19.

2431
01:34:07.634 --> 01:34:09.444
MATT: You guys all impact and roll

2432
01:34:09.444 --> 01:34:11.119
and manage to hold on using the chains

2433
01:34:11.119 --> 01:34:12.832
and not tumble off the sides

2434
01:34:12.832 --> 01:34:14.307
and begin to drag your friends with you.

2435
01:34:14.307 --> 01:34:16.701
You all barely manage to land.

2436
01:34:16.701 --> 01:34:19.024
You're all prone on the ground.

2437
01:34:19.024 --> 01:34:20.915
You made a fuck ton of noise.

2438
01:34:20.915 --> 01:34:22.528
The whispers are getting louder.

2439
01:34:22.528 --> 01:34:24.052
We'll come to that at the beginning of the next round.

2440
01:34:24.052 --> 01:34:26.663
However, that finishes Jester's turn.

2441
01:34:26.663 --> 01:34:28.527
You are no longer tethered to this creature,

2442
01:34:28.527 --> 01:34:30.867
which currently does not exist on this plane.

2443
01:34:30.867 --> 01:34:31.895
Fjord, you're up.

2444
01:34:31.895 --> 01:34:34.051
TRAVIS: Did she use her movement to stand up?

2445
01:34:34.051 --> 01:34:36.395
MATT: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Oh, she is standing up.

2446
01:34:36.395 --> 01:34:37.901
Okay, sorry.

2447
01:34:37.901 --> 01:34:38.867
MATT: So Fjord, your turn.

2448
01:34:38.867 --> 01:34:41.191
I believe you are affected, correct?

2449
01:34:41.191 --> 01:34:42.211
TRAVIS: By what, the fear?

2450
01:34:42.211 --> 01:34:43.949
MATT: Yeah, the wisdom check from earlier.

2451
01:34:43.949 --> 01:34:44.782
TRAVIS: Yes.

2452
01:34:46.692 --> 01:34:47.525
MATT: Fjord.

2453
01:34:49.823 --> 01:34:52.842
As you stand there, or on the ground,

2454
01:34:52.842 --> 01:34:55.342
you stand up in place,

2455
01:34:56.692 --> 01:34:58.624
and I want you to roll a d6 for me.

2456
01:34:58.624 --> 01:35:02.207
One to three, Caleb, four to six, Caduceus.

2457
01:35:03.594 --> 01:35:04.427
TRAVIS: Five.

2458
01:35:05.333 --> 01:35:06.759
MATT: All right, go ahead and make a melee attack

2459
01:35:06.759 --> 01:35:08.517
against Caduceus with your falchion.

2460
01:35:08.517 --> 01:35:11.113
TRAVIS: Just one?
MATT: Just one.

2461
01:35:13.732 --> 01:35:14.847
TRAVIS: 22.

2462
01:35:14.847 --> 01:35:15.741
TALIESIN: That hits.

2463
01:35:15.741 --> 01:35:19.228
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll damage.

2464
01:35:19.228 --> 01:35:20.462
TRAVIS: Not terrible, eight.

2465
01:35:20.462 --> 01:35:21.519
Eight points of slashing damage.

2466
01:35:21.519 --> 01:35:23.111
MATT: Eight points of slashing damage to you, Caduceus.

2467
01:35:23.111 --> 01:35:26.370
Suddenly, the whispers take over Fjord for a moment

2468
01:35:26.370 --> 01:35:28.396
and just hacks into you, past your shield,

2469
01:35:28.396 --> 01:35:31.313
catching you on the shoulder a bit.

2470
01:35:32.786 --> 01:35:33.689
TRAVIS: Sorry.

2471
01:35:33.689 --> 01:35:35.390
MATT: Your turns over, you regain consciousness and focus.

2472
01:35:35.390 --> 01:35:36.508
Caleb?

2473
01:35:36.508 --> 01:35:39.014
LIAM: I'm going to get up to standing

2474
01:35:39.014 --> 01:35:40.975
and while I do that, I'm going to streak molasses

2475
01:35:40.975 --> 01:35:44.105
across my right palm and hold the Slow spell

2476
01:35:44.105 --> 01:35:46.028
for when that thing appears.

2477
01:35:46.028 --> 01:35:47.508
MATT: Okay.

2478
01:35:47.508 --> 01:35:49.091
Keeping that there.

2479
01:35:50.313 --> 01:35:52.763
That brings us to the top of the round.

2480
01:35:52.763 --> 01:35:54.363
I need everyone to make a wisdom saving throw for me,

2481
01:35:54.363 --> 01:35:57.742
please, as the loud whispers continue to barrel through

2482
01:35:57.742 --> 01:36:00.575
from the noise that has been made.

2483
01:36:01.674 --> 01:36:03.500
LIAM: Natural 20.

2484
01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:04.333
ASHLEY: Ah, yes.

2485
01:36:04.333 --> 01:36:05.166
MARISHA: 11.

2486
01:36:05.166 --> 01:36:07.253
TRAVIS: It's a wisdom saving throw?
MATT: Correct.

2487
01:36:07.253 --> 01:36:11.406
TRAVIS: That is a 21 for a Fjord and 17 for Jester.

2488
01:36:11.406 --> 01:36:12.468
MATT: Okay.

2489
01:36:12.468 --> 01:36:13.974
SAM: Natural one.

2490
01:36:13.974 --> 01:36:15.914
TALIESIN: Natural 20 and is, yeah.

2491
01:36:15.914 --> 01:36:17.879
MATT: That's a lot of natural 20s this time, well done.

2492
01:36:17.879 --> 01:36:19.836
ASHLEY: That is--
MATT: Of course, it's Taliesin.

2493
01:36:19.836 --> 01:36:21.391
TRAVIS: For clarification--
ASHLEY: 17.

2494
01:36:21.391 --> 01:36:22.641
TRAVIS: It's a wisdom saving throw and not just a

2495
01:36:22.641 --> 01:36:24.157
wisdom check?
MATT: Correct.

2496
01:36:24.157 --> 01:36:26.015
TRAVIS: Have they all been that?
MATT: Yes.

2497
01:36:26.015 --> 01:36:28.638
TRAVIS: Oh, I've been doing wisdom checks with Fjord.

2498
01:36:28.638 --> 01:36:29.791
Wisdom saves are better.

2499
01:36:29.791 --> 01:36:30.955
MATT: Yes, they are.

2500
01:36:30.955 --> 01:36:32.696
Well, now you know.
TRAVIS: Good start.

2501
01:36:32.696 --> 01:36:33.788
MATT: It's okay.

2502
01:36:33.788 --> 01:36:35.904
So what'd you roll this time?

2503
01:36:35.904 --> 01:36:38.195
TRAVIS: 21 and Jester rolled a 17.

2504
01:36:38.195 --> 01:36:39.765
MATT: Okay, you and Nott are the two that failed this

2505
01:36:39.765 --> 01:36:41.773
when we get to that. Top of the round is Beau.

2506
01:36:41.773 --> 01:36:43.304
MARISHA: I'm not going to have shit to do this day.

2507
01:36:43.304 --> 01:36:44.137
MATT: Beauregard.

2508
01:36:46.558 --> 01:36:49.932
Beauregard, you go ahead and get up off the ground

2509
01:36:49.932 --> 01:36:51.905
and take a swing at Jester.

2510
01:36:51.905 --> 01:36:53.787
Go ahead and roll an attack for me, please.

2511
01:36:53.787 --> 01:36:55.497
MARISHA: I don't want to, though.

2512
01:36:55.497 --> 01:36:57.458
I don't want to hit Jester.

2513
01:36:57.458 --> 01:36:58.929
Natural one!

2514
01:36:58.929 --> 01:37:00.176
MATT: There you go!

2515
01:37:00.176 --> 01:37:03.145
Jester just pulls back a bit and you swing wildly,

2516
01:37:03.145 --> 01:37:07.379
a giant haymaker that's very uncharacteristic of Beauregard.

2517
01:37:07.379 --> 01:37:09.084
You regain--
MARISHA: I don't want to!

2518
01:37:09.084 --> 01:37:11.417
MATT: You regain yourself there.

2519
01:37:12.949 --> 01:37:13.949
All right.

2520
01:37:16.436 --> 01:37:17.844
TRAVIS: (as Jester) What the fuck, Beau?

2521
01:37:17.844 --> 01:37:19.227
MARISHA: Sorry!

2522
01:37:20.219 --> 01:37:22.160
LIAM: I mean, come on!
MATT: The roper's turn. Does nothing.

2523
01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:23.268
Caduceus?

2524
01:37:23.268 --> 01:37:24.543
TALIESIN: I'm going to get up

2525
01:37:24.543 --> 01:37:27.137
and, I suppose, move with the group as we go,

2526
01:37:27.137 --> 01:37:29.491
but I'm also, is it-- have we--

2527
01:37:29.491 --> 01:37:31.085
is there still noise happening?

2528
01:37:31.085 --> 01:37:32.904
Is this like, is it obvious that next round

2529
01:37:32.904 --> 01:37:34.921
we're going to be in the midst of this again?

2530
01:37:34.921 --> 01:37:37.321
MATT: You're not sure, the voices are subsiding

2531
01:37:37.321 --> 01:37:39.968
because there hasn't been a loud noise yet this round.

2532
01:37:39.968 --> 01:37:41.740
So you're uncertain.

2533
01:37:41.740 --> 01:37:43.355
Depends on what happens for the rest of this round.

2534
01:37:43.355 --> 01:37:44.980
TALIESIN: Can I hold an action

2535
01:37:44.980 --> 01:37:46.636
if the voices start coming up?

2536
01:37:46.636 --> 01:37:47.677
MATT: What do you want to hold?

2537
01:37:47.677 --> 01:37:48.889
TALIESIN: A spell.

2538
01:37:48.889 --> 01:37:49.722
MATT: What spell?

2539
01:37:49.722 --> 01:37:50.555
TALIESIN: Bless.

2540
01:37:50.555 --> 01:37:51.388
MATT: Sure.

2541
01:37:51.388 --> 01:37:52.997
So you keep Bless up and ready to go.

2542
01:37:52.997 --> 01:37:55.963
You got it, that gets us to Nott.

2543
01:37:55.963 --> 01:37:56.908
SAM: I failed.

2544
01:37:56.908 --> 01:37:58.713
MATT: Oh, that's right.

2545
01:37:58.713 --> 01:38:00.418
SAM: Bye, guys.

2546
01:38:00.418 --> 01:38:02.083
MATT: You go running off the side.

2547
01:38:02.083 --> 01:38:03.715
MARISHA: No!

2548
01:38:03.715 --> 01:38:06.165
That's the worst one!
MATT: You have to roll a d6

2549
01:38:06.165 --> 01:38:07.665
to see which direction you go.

2550
01:38:07.665 --> 01:38:08.586
SAM: I have to roll a d6?

2551
01:38:08.586 --> 01:38:10.133
MATT: Yes, you do.

2552
01:38:10.133 --> 01:38:11.899
Because it's a random direction you run.

2553
01:38:11.899 --> 01:38:13.078
SAM: Three?

2554
01:38:13.078 --> 01:38:13.911
MATT: Three.

2555
01:38:13.911 --> 01:38:14.930
All right, so you're going at an angle.

2556
01:38:14.930 --> 01:38:15.883
Yep.

2557
01:38:15.883 --> 01:38:17.471
LIAM: When holding an action, can I cast a reaction?

2558
01:38:17.471 --> 01:38:19.398
Use a reaction still?

2559
01:38:19.398 --> 01:38:20.805
MATT: You'd get to cast Slow.

2560
01:38:20.805 --> 01:38:23.149
LIAM: To cast Slow, I can use the reaction?

2561
01:38:23.149 --> 01:38:24.390
MATT: You said you were holding Slow.

2562
01:38:24.390 --> 01:38:25.949
LIAM: I'm holding, as my action, Slow,

2563
01:38:25.949 --> 01:38:27.520
but if I, I don't know how the mechanics works,

2564
01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:28.537
because I've never done this before,

2565
01:38:28.537 --> 01:38:29.871
but if I'm holding an action spell,

2566
01:38:29.871 --> 01:38:32.386
can I use a reaction spell or will I drop the--

2567
01:38:32.386 --> 01:38:33.889
MATT: Holding your action is your reaction.

2568
01:38:33.889 --> 01:38:34.946
LIAM: Is the reaction?

2569
01:38:34.946 --> 01:38:35.779
Got it.
ASHLEY: You slow her down

2570
01:38:35.779 --> 01:38:38.360
and I can try to grab her.

2571
01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:41.810
LIAM: I don't think it would affect the mechanics that way.

2572
01:38:41.810 --> 01:38:46.194
So I could trade for a reaction spell instead?

2573
01:38:46.194 --> 01:38:47.685
MATT: You're holding Slow.

2574
01:38:47.685 --> 01:38:48.518
LIAM: Okay, cool.

2575
01:38:48.518 --> 01:38:49.520
MATT: Unfortunately, I'm sorry.

2576
01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:53.020
LIAM: I've just never had the scenario before.

2577
01:38:54.099 --> 01:38:57.849
MATT: Nott just turns, runs, and swan dives off the bridge.

2578
01:38:57.849 --> 01:38:59.052
ASHLEY: Can I, because I'm closer,

2579
01:38:59.052 --> 01:39:01.625
can I try to use a reaction to grab her?

2580
01:39:01.625 --> 01:39:04.764
MATT: Unfortunately, you weren't right next to Nott.

2581
01:39:04.764 --> 01:39:07.323
Nott was just far away out of the battle.

2582
01:39:07.323 --> 01:39:09.579
TRAVIS: Well, it's either Jester or me.

2583
01:39:09.579 --> 01:39:10.817
ASHLEY: Did we even see how far ahead--

2584
01:39:10.817 --> 01:39:12.401
how far ahead were you?

2585
01:39:12.401 --> 01:39:14.318
MATT: 10 feet ahead of you.

2586
01:39:16.789 --> 01:39:19.686
TALIESIN: I mean, there's a reaction to speed this up, so.

2587
01:39:19.686 --> 01:39:23.530
MATT: Nott, you got-- your turn comes back to you

2588
01:39:23.530 --> 01:39:25.699
right as you're falling and all you see is teeth and eyes

2589
01:39:25.699 --> 01:39:29.146
before you slam halfway into one of these large open mouths.

2590
01:39:29.146 --> 01:39:31.481
It's like slamming into a heavy water bed.

2591
01:39:31.481 --> 01:39:33.824
You impact and it cuts you in places

2592
01:39:33.824 --> 01:39:35.702
and you stop and suddenly you feel it

2593
01:39:35.702 --> 01:39:38.869
chewing on your entire body in places.

2594
01:39:40.081 --> 01:39:41.819
You--
SAM: Impact damage or just

2595
01:39:41.819 --> 01:39:43.335
a nice, soft landing?

2596
01:39:43.335 --> 01:39:44.707
MATT: Yes, you do take impact damage.

2597
01:39:44.707 --> 01:39:45.540
Not as much as you would

2598
01:39:45.540 --> 01:39:47.958
because it's a softer landing into the flesh.

2599
01:39:47.958 --> 01:39:49.108
You take six points

2600
01:39:49.108 --> 01:39:51.675
of bludgeoning damage from the impact.

2601
01:39:51.675 --> 01:39:52.508
SAM: Okay.

2602
01:39:52.508 --> 01:39:54.779
MATT: And it has advantage on the attack roll against you

2603
01:39:54.779 --> 01:39:56.138
because you are in its--

2604
01:39:56.138 --> 01:39:58.645
oh that'll be 20 to hit?

2605
01:39:58.645 --> 01:39:59.562
SAM: That hits.

2606
01:39:59.562 --> 01:40:00.771
MATT: All right.

2607
01:40:00.771 --> 01:40:05.751
You suffer eight points of piercing damage

2608
01:40:05.751 --> 01:40:10.745
as it begins to chew you in and you are currently grappled.

2609
01:40:10.745 --> 01:40:12.938
SAM: (screaming)

2610
01:40:12.938 --> 01:40:14.816
MATT: The whispers begin to rise up

2611
01:40:14.816 --> 01:40:16.197
again from the scream of Nott.

2612
01:40:16.197 --> 01:40:17.689
TALIESIN: My Bless reaction hits.

2613
01:40:17.689 --> 01:40:22.204
I'm going to hit Jester, I'm going to hit Fjord,

2614
01:40:22.204 --> 01:40:24.374
and I'm going to hit you.

2615
01:40:24.374 --> 01:40:28.282
The three of you are getting a Bless.

2616
01:40:28.282 --> 01:40:31.639
TRAVIS: Do we know how far Nott fell-ish, no?

2617
01:40:31.639 --> 01:40:32.472
MATT: You don't.

2618
01:40:32.472 --> 01:40:34.347
TALIESIN: It was pretty fast, though, so.

2619
01:40:34.347 --> 01:40:36.516
MATT: You heard the impact.

2620
01:40:36.516 --> 01:40:38.298
It's not too far down there.

2621
01:40:38.298 --> 01:40:39.887
TRAVIS: You took bludgeoning damage from the fall?

2622
01:40:39.887 --> 01:40:41.412
SAM: Just a few.

2623
01:40:41.412 --> 01:40:44.045
MATT: All right, that finishes Caduceus' turn.

2624
01:40:44.045 --> 01:40:45.578
Or no, sorry, wait, you were holding?

2625
01:40:45.578 --> 01:40:46.411
TALIESIN: I was holding Bless.

2626
01:40:46.411 --> 01:40:48.581
MATT: You were holding Bless, okay. So the Bless goes off.

2627
01:40:48.581 --> 01:40:49.734
That finishes Nott's turn.

2628
01:40:49.734 --> 01:40:51.179
Yasha, you're up.

2629
01:40:51.179 --> 01:40:52.237
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

2630
01:40:52.237 --> 01:40:55.859
MATT: You just watched Nott plummet off the side.

2631
01:40:55.859 --> 01:40:59.926
ASHLEY: Uh, okay, I'm just going to go up

2632
01:40:59.926 --> 01:41:02.754
to where I saw her fall off and...

2633
01:41:05.679 --> 01:41:07.454
Look over the edge.

2634
01:41:08.911 --> 01:41:09.915
I guess Jester and I are

2635
01:41:09.915 --> 01:41:10.990
still connected to each other, so.

2636
01:41:10.990 --> 01:41:11.981
MATT: You're still connected, yeah.

2637
01:41:11.981 --> 01:41:13.597
So actually, no, you can get this far.

2638
01:41:13.597 --> 01:41:15.021
You've got about 15 feet between.

2639
01:41:15.021 --> 01:41:16.870
So you get to the edge and look over.

2640
01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:18.669
Make a perception check.

2641
01:41:18.669 --> 01:41:19.698
LIAM: Don't you hate Mondays?

2642
01:41:19.698 --> 01:41:21.249
Killed my whole family.

2643
01:41:21.249 --> 01:41:25.932
(laughter)

2644
01:41:27.316 --> 01:41:28.835
ASHLEY: 14.
MATT: 14?

2645
01:41:28.835 --> 01:41:29.739
Okay.

2646
01:41:29.739 --> 01:41:31.982
It's not great, but you can glance down

2647
01:41:31.982 --> 01:41:34.143
and you can hear from the sound that Nott's making,

2648
01:41:34.143 --> 01:41:37.537
Nott's probably about 40 or so feet from you.

2649
01:41:37.537 --> 01:41:40.273
SAM: (screams "Immigrant Song" opening)

2650
01:41:40.273 --> 01:41:41.441
ASHLEY: Yes, okay.

2651
01:41:41.441 --> 01:41:42.791
SAM: (continues scream-singing)

2652
01:41:42.791 --> 01:41:45.063
MATT: Anything else on your turn?

2653
01:41:45.063 --> 01:41:46.037
ASHLEY: No.

2654
01:41:46.037 --> 01:41:48.123
MATT: All right, so Yasha's being careful.

2655
01:41:48.123 --> 01:41:49.123
ASHLEY: Oh, yeah, I'll cut the rope.

2656
01:41:49.123 --> 01:41:50.529
Sorry, I thought she was going to cut the rope.

2657
01:41:50.529 --> 01:41:51.817
MATT: Okay, so you just completely cut the rope

2658
01:41:51.817 --> 01:41:52.959
between you and Jester.

2659
01:41:52.959 --> 01:41:55.262
All right, that brings us to Jester's turn.

2660
01:41:55.262 --> 01:41:56.943
TRAVIS: All right.

2661
01:41:56.943 --> 01:41:58.526
Fucking anus, okay.

2662
01:42:01.076 --> 01:42:02.614
Yeah, all right.

2663
01:42:02.614 --> 01:42:05.497
Jester's going to, oh crap.

2664
01:42:05.497 --> 01:42:06.968
MATT: What's Jester doing?

2665
01:42:06.968 --> 01:42:08.637
TRAVIS: (heavy sigh)

2666
01:42:08.637 --> 01:42:10.225
SAM: Is she texting you or are you just making this up?

2667
01:42:10.225 --> 01:42:12.494
TRAVIS: (yelling) Yeah, she's doing a lot, okay?!

2668
01:42:12.494 --> 01:42:15.786
(laughter)

2669
01:42:15.786 --> 01:42:17.007
LIAM: We're in a tight spot.

2670
01:42:17.007 --> 01:42:18.642
TRAVIS: I'm not doing this to my wife.

2671
01:42:18.642 --> 01:42:21.439
Jester's going to hold her action.

2672
01:42:21.439 --> 01:42:23.138
SAM: You're not following her instructions?!

2673
01:42:23.138 --> 01:42:24.061
TRAVIS: No.

2674
01:42:24.061 --> 01:42:24.894
SAM: You're--

2675
01:42:24.894 --> 01:42:26.358
TRAVIS: No, she can't, I can't do it when she's not here.

2676
01:42:26.358 --> 01:42:27.927
That's too, you're in the maw of fucking--

2677
01:42:27.927 --> 01:42:29.951
SAM: She's telling you what to do and you're ignoring?

2678
01:42:29.951 --> 01:42:30.784
TRAVIS: That is correct.

2679
01:42:30.784 --> 01:42:31.693
SAM: You're ignoring the launch command?!

2680
01:42:31.693 --> 01:42:32.526
TRAVIS: Yep.

2681
01:42:32.526 --> 01:42:33.725
I will not turn the key.

2682
01:42:33.725 --> 01:42:35.347
(yelling)

2683
01:42:35.347 --> 01:42:36.655
MATT: Wait, Laura's telling you what she wants to do

2684
01:42:36.655 --> 01:42:38.071
this turn and you're not going to do it?

2685
01:42:38.071 --> 01:42:39.671
TRAVIS: She's giving me an 'if'.

2686
01:42:39.671 --> 01:42:40.825
She's giving me an 'if'.

2687
01:42:40.825 --> 01:42:42.266
I can't do it.

2688
01:42:42.266 --> 01:42:43.099
She said do it.

2689
01:42:43.099 --> 01:42:43.932
All right.

2690
01:42:43.932 --> 01:42:45.652
(laughter)

2691
01:42:45.652 --> 01:42:47.291
SAM: Turn the key, Sergeant!

2692
01:42:47.291 --> 01:42:49.824
TRAVIS: Jester's going to jump off the bridge after Nott.

2693
01:42:49.824 --> 01:42:51.210
MATT: Okay.

2694
01:42:51.210 --> 01:42:55.674
Jester runs, the rope no longer holding her, leaps,

2695
01:42:55.674 --> 01:42:58.357
falls and smacks into this

2696
01:42:58.357 --> 01:43:01.721
churning, gelatinous

2697
01:43:01.721 --> 01:43:06.022
cavern-like river of grinding flesh, bone, and teeth.

2698
01:43:06.022 --> 01:43:07.967
She takes seven points

2699
01:43:07.967 --> 01:43:09.862
of bludgeoning damage from the impact.

2700
01:43:13.012 --> 01:43:14.137
TRAVIS: Okay.

2701
01:43:14.137 --> 01:43:16.524
MATT: With an attack of advantage against her.

2702
01:43:16.524 --> 01:43:17.749
That's a 16 to hit.

2703
01:43:17.749 --> 01:43:18.800
What's her armor class?

2704
01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:19.833
TRAVIS: 18.

2705
01:43:19.833 --> 01:43:21.513
MATT: The armor manages to take the brunt of it.

2706
01:43:21.513 --> 01:43:23.227
It doesn't manage to pierce or damage her,

2707
01:43:23.227 --> 01:43:25.758
but she is currently being slowly swallowed by this.

2708
01:43:25.758 --> 01:43:28.979
Both her and Nott are both being absorbed by this.

2709
01:43:28.979 --> 01:43:30.491
TRAVIS: Can she see or reach Nott at all?

2710
01:43:30.491 --> 01:43:31.714
MATT: Yeah, she's landed right next to her.

2711
01:43:31.714 --> 01:43:32.880
TRAVIS: Great, she's going to grab Nott

2712
01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:34.685
and cast Dimension Door.

2713
01:43:34.685 --> 01:43:36.161
MARISHA: Yes!
MATT: Okay.

2714
01:43:36.161 --> 01:43:38.635
Towards the--
TRAVIS: Towards the,

2715
01:43:38.635 --> 01:43:41.019
up and fucking front end of the darkness,

2716
01:43:41.019 --> 01:43:42.963
just assuming like, quick look,

2717
01:43:42.963 --> 01:43:44.006
if the bridge goes that way,

2718
01:43:44.006 --> 01:43:45.950
it's just as far as she can go in that direction.

2719
01:43:45.950 --> 01:43:46.783
MATT: Okay.

2720
01:43:46.783 --> 01:43:48.568
I will say, make a

2721
01:43:48.568 --> 01:43:51.352
general intelligence check for Jester.

2722
01:43:51.352 --> 01:43:53.450
Jester, who has not seen where the bridge's end is

2723
01:43:53.450 --> 01:43:55.483
and is having to discern guesswork here

2724
01:43:55.483 --> 01:43:56.889
towards the trajectory.

2725
01:43:56.889 --> 01:44:00.139
LIAM: Jester.
ASHLEY: This is far down the bridge?

2726
01:44:04.412 --> 01:44:05.486
TRAVIS: 20.
MATT: 20?

2727
01:44:05.486 --> 01:44:06.319
TRAVIS: Natural 19.

2728
01:44:06.319 --> 01:44:07.285
MATT: Yeah, no, easy enough.

2729
01:44:07.285 --> 01:44:08.884
Jester looks at the direction,

2730
01:44:08.884 --> 01:44:11.558
remembers what Caleb had been saying about distance,

2731
01:44:11.558 --> 01:44:13.142
makes a pretty informed decision.

2732
01:44:13.142 --> 01:44:15.346
Grabbing out and reaching Nott's hand,

2733
01:44:15.346 --> 01:44:18.534
finishes casting the spell. (whooshing) They both disappear

2734
01:44:18.534 --> 01:44:21.293
from the inside of this large, fleshy mass,

2735
01:44:21.293 --> 01:44:23.362
and both appear about five feet

2736
01:44:23.362 --> 01:44:26.362
towards the very opposite end of the bridge.

2737
01:44:26.362 --> 01:44:27.195
LIAM: Oh!

2738
01:44:28.701 --> 01:44:30.842
MATT: Which is...
LIAM: Oh, Jester.

2739
01:44:33.199 --> 01:44:34.699
MATT: Right about there.

2740
01:44:35.976 --> 01:44:38.309
Moving you guys forward now.

2741
01:44:41.164 --> 01:44:43.109
TALIESIN: It's been a long bridge, people.

2742
01:44:43.109 --> 01:44:45.109
MARISHA and ASHLEY: This is a long bridge.

2743
01:44:47.208 --> 01:44:48.074
MARISHA: Okay.

2744
01:44:48.074 --> 01:44:49.635
MATT: Both safe out of the side.

2745
01:44:49.635 --> 01:44:50.818
You guys don't know that.

2746
01:44:50.818 --> 01:44:52.970
You just saw them both disappear off the edge

2747
01:44:52.970 --> 01:44:53.959
and they're gone.

2748
01:44:53.959 --> 01:44:56.584
TRAVIS: As a bonus action can Jester turn to Nott and go:

2749
01:44:56.584 --> 01:44:58.282
Nott!
(smacking)

2750
01:44:58.282 --> 01:44:59.258
And slap her?

2751
01:44:59.258 --> 01:45:00.497
MATT: Sure!

2752
01:45:00.497 --> 01:45:02.613
ASHLEY: Did I see them pfft?

2753
01:45:02.613 --> 01:45:03.455
Bamf out?

2754
01:45:03.455 --> 01:45:05.313
MATT: I would say because you're right there looking over,

2755
01:45:05.313 --> 01:45:06.446
yes. You do see that.

2756
01:45:06.446 --> 01:45:07.524
TRAVIS: (as Jester) The fuck, Nott?

2757
01:45:07.524 --> 01:45:10.614
MATT: You see a little like blue-ish flash of energy

2758
01:45:10.614 --> 01:45:11.482
and they both disappear.

2759
01:45:11.482 --> 01:45:12.556
ASHLEY: Okay.

2760
01:45:12.556 --> 01:45:14.012
MATT: All right, that finishes Jester's turn.

2761
01:45:14.012 --> 01:45:14.974
Fjord, you're up.

2762
01:45:14.974 --> 01:45:16.641
TRAVIS: Oh, my turn?
MATT: Yep.

2763
01:45:17.940 --> 01:45:18.842
TRAVIS: Okay.

2764
01:45:18.842 --> 01:45:21.342
I can't see any other enemies.

2765
01:45:22.234 --> 01:45:24.848
I will move slowly towards--

2766
01:45:24.848 --> 01:45:27.230
MATT: By the way, I need Jester to make a concentration

2767
01:45:27.230 --> 01:45:28.694
check for the damage she took,

2768
01:45:28.694 --> 01:45:30.038
because she's concentrating on Banishment.

2769
01:45:30.038 --> 01:45:31.121
TRAVIS: Okay, okay.

2770
01:45:33.459 --> 01:45:36.367
MARISHA: Roll a, you know, a 10.

2771
01:45:37.476 --> 01:45:38.309
TRAVIS: Concentration--

2772
01:45:38.309 --> 01:45:39.567
Not saving throw; it's a check?

2773
01:45:39.567 --> 01:45:40.740
MATT: It's a constitution saving throw.

2774
01:45:40.740 --> 01:45:41.928
TRAVIS: Oh, constitution saving throw.

2775
01:45:41.928 --> 01:45:43.600
MATT: Yes.
TRAVIS: Okay.

2776
01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:44.433
MARISHA: You'll be fine.

2777
01:45:44.433 --> 01:45:45.266
TALIESIN: She's got Bless?

2778
01:45:45.266 --> 01:45:47.036
She's got Bless, so add a d4 to it.

2779
01:45:47.036 --> 01:45:51.375
TRAVIS: Here it comes. 11 plus two, so thirteen.

2780
01:45:51.375 --> 01:45:55.825
MATT: She maintains the Banishment, that's good.

2781
01:45:55.825 --> 01:45:57.787
So the roper does not return.

2782
01:45:57.787 --> 01:45:59.477
So Fjord, continue your turn, please.

2783
01:45:59.477 --> 01:46:03.655
TRAVIS: All right, I'll just hold two Eldritch Blasts

2784
01:46:03.655 --> 01:46:04.700
for anything that shows up,

2785
01:46:04.700 --> 01:46:07.192
and I will walk towards the other end of the bridge.

2786
01:46:07.192 --> 01:46:09.149
TALIESIN: I think we're all walking.

2787
01:46:09.149 --> 01:46:10.707
MATT: That's as far as you can get with the rope

2788
01:46:10.707 --> 01:46:11.861
still attached to you and Caleb.

2789
01:46:11.861 --> 01:46:13.926
TALIESIN: I mean, is there a way for us to move in tandem?

2790
01:46:13.926 --> 01:46:15.834
MATT: I can say, there's not current combat,

2791
01:46:15.834 --> 01:46:17.423
I'd say at this point.

2792
01:46:17.423 --> 01:46:18.628
TALIESIN: Just that way we're not like.

2793
01:46:18.628 --> 01:46:20.539
MATT: You guys all be like shift, move forward.

2794
01:46:20.539 --> 01:46:21.678
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're all moving.

2795
01:46:21.678 --> 01:46:23.886
LIAM: Time is a little loosier-goosier now?

2796
01:46:23.886 --> 01:46:25.811
MATT: It is. Are you guys moving stealthily or not?

2797
01:46:25.811 --> 01:46:26.644
LIAM: Spell slot is gone.

2798
01:46:26.644 --> 01:46:29.063
MATT: Or are you going full run?

2799
01:46:29.063 --> 01:46:30.071
TALIESIN: I mean--

2800
01:46:30.071 --> 01:46:31.279
TRAVIS: I would rather make less checks.

2801
01:46:31.279 --> 01:46:32.417
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah.

2802
01:46:32.417 --> 01:46:37.211
MARISHA: I don't want to keep jumping off this bridge.

2803
01:46:37.211 --> 01:46:38.425
MATT: So you go into into a full run?

2804
01:46:38.425 --> 01:46:40.468
SAM: Is that an expression?

2805
01:46:40.468 --> 01:46:42.925
TRAVIS: Sky dive Underdark is a shitty place.

2806
01:46:42.925 --> 01:46:44.500
TALIESIN: Let's do normal speed.

2807
01:46:44.500 --> 01:46:46.972
Are we burning our actions, too, for running?

2808
01:46:46.972 --> 01:46:48.076
MATT: That's what I'm saying. Are we--

2809
01:46:48.076 --> 01:46:49.078
TRAVIS: If we are out of initiative,

2810
01:46:49.078 --> 01:46:51.833
Jester would like to not cast anything,

2811
01:46:51.833 --> 01:46:53.239
because she's at the other end of the bridge.

2812
01:46:53.239 --> 01:46:54.680
Let's go stealthily.

2813
01:46:54.680 --> 01:46:56.487
TALIESIN: Let's go, yeah.
TRAVIS: Or regular?

2814
01:46:56.487 --> 01:46:58.658
TALIESIN: Let's go regular, just a little faster

2815
01:46:58.658 --> 01:46:59.749
than we were going before.

2816
01:46:59.749 --> 01:47:00.820
MATT: Okay, so you're just going your full movement?

2817
01:47:00.820 --> 01:47:01.815
TRAVIS: Yep.
MATT: All right.

2818
01:47:01.815 --> 01:47:02.706
MARISHA: Okay.

2819
01:47:02.706 --> 01:47:03.539
Okay!

2820
01:47:03.539 --> 01:47:05.186
TALIESIN: So that we can do things.

2821
01:47:05.186 --> 01:47:06.776
LIAM: Fall through slats in the bridge.

2822
01:47:06.776 --> 01:47:08.100
MATT: The rest of you guys.

2823
01:47:08.100 --> 01:47:09.968
Beauregard can go.

2824
01:47:09.968 --> 01:47:11.985
MARISHA: I-- yeah.

2825
01:47:13.226 --> 01:47:14.300
MATT: 40 feet, right?

2826
01:47:14.300 --> 01:47:17.279
MARISHA: Am I still tied to people?

2827
01:47:17.279 --> 01:47:18.369
MATT: You--

2828
01:47:18.369 --> 01:47:20.559
MARISHA: I was tied to Yash--

2829
01:47:20.559 --> 01:47:23.585
MATT: No, you're tied to--
ASHLEY: You were tied to Jester--

2830
01:47:23.585 --> 01:47:25.724
SAM: You're tied to the rest of the four.

2831
01:47:25.724 --> 01:47:26.592
MARISHA: Okay.

2832
01:47:26.592 --> 01:47:28.089
LIAM: I'm tied to--

2833
01:47:28.089 --> 01:47:30.322
TALIESIN: As long as someone's near Yasha to make sure that

2834
01:47:30.322 --> 01:47:32.014
we can catch her.
MATT: So that's your guys' go.

2835
01:47:32.014 --> 01:47:33.727
All right.

2836
01:47:33.727 --> 01:47:36.716
The whispers, because there was no stealthy approach,

2837
01:47:36.716 --> 01:47:37.856
rise up and I need wisdom checks

2838
01:47:37.856 --> 01:47:39.783
from everybody again, once more.

2839
01:47:39.783 --> 01:47:40.810
SAM: Even on the end of the bridge?
MATT: Yep.

2840
01:47:40.810 --> 01:47:42.270
TRAVIS: Saving throws or wisdom checks?

2841
01:47:42.270 --> 01:47:44.187
MATT: Sorry, saving throws.

2842
01:47:46.105 --> 01:47:47.297
TALIESIN: Whoa!

2843
01:47:47.297 --> 01:47:48.355
What the fuck!

2844
01:47:48.355 --> 01:47:50.044
SAM: That is a crazy roll!

2845
01:47:50.044 --> 01:47:52.232
Balancing a natural 20 and--

2846
01:47:52.232 --> 01:47:53.767
MATT: Take a picture of this!

2847
01:47:53.767 --> 01:47:55.317
TALIESIN: I'm taking a picture.

2848
01:47:55.317 --> 01:47:58.011
MATT: You are a fucking warlock, Taliesin.

2849
01:47:58.011 --> 01:47:59.105
TALIESIN: I don't know what--

2850
01:47:59.105 --> 01:48:00.522
SAM: It's balancing.

2851
01:48:01.497 --> 01:48:02.666
ASHLEY: That's crazy.

2852
01:48:02.666 --> 01:48:04.596
What number 20 is that for you?

2853
01:48:04.596 --> 01:48:06.201
TALIESIN: I don't know, it's been a really good.

2854
01:48:06.201 --> 01:48:07.535
It's been like a Percy day.

2855
01:48:07.535 --> 01:48:09.236
MATT: Apparently.

2856
01:48:09.236 --> 01:48:10.686
SAM: 20 also. Natural 20.

2857
01:48:10.686 --> 01:48:11.721
MATT: Damn.
MARISHA: You also got a natural 20?

2858
01:48:11.721 --> 01:48:13.979
ASHLEY: Natural one.

2859
01:48:13.979 --> 01:48:16.224
LIAM: 27.
MARISHA: Natural 20.

2860
01:48:16.224 --> 01:48:17.909
MATT: Fjord?
SAM: Three natural 20s?

2861
01:48:17.909 --> 01:48:18.834
MARISHA: Three natural 20s this turn!

2862
01:48:18.834 --> 01:48:20.810
TRAVIS: 19, 17 for Jester.

2863
01:48:20.810 --> 01:48:23.049
TALIESIN: And Jester's got the d4, too.

2864
01:48:23.049 --> 01:48:24.466
I think I blessed her.

2865
01:48:24.466 --> 01:48:26.657
MATT: So everyone moving forward towards this.

2866
01:48:26.657 --> 01:48:28.195
Yasha, you're the only one.

2867
01:48:28.195 --> 01:48:29.492
MARISHA: No, no no no, no no.

2868
01:48:29.492 --> 01:48:31.084
SAM: ♪ You're the only one! ♪

2869
01:48:31.084 --> 01:48:32.421
MATT: You just go catatonic.

2870
01:48:32.421 --> 01:48:33.571
You guys watch as Yasha's running

2871
01:48:33.571 --> 01:48:35.961
and then just stops and leans forwards for a second.

2872
01:48:35.961 --> 01:48:38.903
The rest of you rush, and Beauregard

2873
01:48:38.903 --> 01:48:40.729
that gets you up to the edge.

2874
01:48:40.729 --> 01:48:42.492
You guys are all getting close, moving passed Yasha,

2875
01:48:42.492 --> 01:48:43.768
and you're just making your movement.

2876
01:48:43.768 --> 01:48:45.002
What's your action?

2877
01:48:45.002 --> 01:48:47.258
Are you doing anything with your action?

2878
01:48:47.258 --> 01:48:49.700
TRAVIS: I'll use my action to double my movement.

2879
01:48:50.567 --> 01:48:52.896
LIAM: As we're hustling away, I--

2880
01:48:52.896 --> 01:48:54.176
MATT: We'll say, for the purposes of this, you guys,

2881
01:48:54.176 --> 01:48:55.578
if you all take your action and move forward,

2882
01:48:55.578 --> 01:48:56.931
except for Yasha.

2883
01:48:56.931 --> 01:48:58.388
TALIESIN: I'm not leaving Yasha on the bridge.

2884
01:48:58.388 --> 01:48:59.747
MATT: Okay, so you're staying there with Yasha?

2885
01:48:59.747 --> 01:49:02.344
TALIESIN: No, and since we're tied, I kind of--

2886
01:49:02.344 --> 01:49:04.020
SAM: That means the others get to go--

2887
01:49:04.020 --> 01:49:07.880
TALIESIN: I'm staying right next to her, actually.

2888
01:49:07.880 --> 01:49:10.426
LIAM: As we're hustling out, Caleb remembers Frumpkin,

2889
01:49:10.426 --> 01:49:13.852
and instructs Frumpkin to carry the cording out of the cage,

2890
01:49:13.852 --> 01:49:15.863
if he can get out, to them.

2891
01:49:15.863 --> 01:49:17.229
MATT: Okay.

2892
01:49:17.229 --> 01:49:22.204
Have, make an acrobatics check for the vulture

2893
01:49:22.204 --> 01:49:25.748
to see if it can squeeze through the bars.

2894
01:49:25.748 --> 01:49:26.651
LIAM: Eight.

2895
01:49:26.651 --> 01:49:27.975
MATT: Eight? No.
LIAM: No.

2896
01:49:27.975 --> 01:49:29.366
MATT: It has the cord in its mouth,

2897
01:49:29.366 --> 01:49:30.841
but the bars are too small

2898
01:49:30.841 --> 01:49:34.958
for its larger vulture form to squeeze through.

2899
01:49:34.958 --> 01:49:36.047
What are you going to do?

2900
01:49:36.047 --> 01:49:37.316
MARISHA: Can't bamf with it?

2901
01:49:37.316 --> 01:49:38.149
LIAM: No.

2902
01:49:38.149 --> 01:49:40.748
MATT: Not with the item, no.

2903
01:49:40.748 --> 01:49:42.199
LIAM: So Frumpkin is going--

2904
01:49:42.199 --> 01:49:45.951
can Frumpkin attempt to gently slide the cording

2905
01:49:45.951 --> 01:49:49.637
through the cages and deposit it on the outside of the cage?

2906
01:49:49.637 --> 01:49:50.768
MATT: Okay.

2907
01:49:50.768 --> 01:49:52.195
It lands on the edge of the precipice.

2908
01:49:52.195 --> 01:49:54.846
Also, go ahead and roll a d6 for me.

2909
01:49:56.029 --> 01:49:57.529
LIAM: Six.
MATT: Six, okay.

2910
01:49:57.529 --> 01:50:00.323
It falls and rolls a little bit towards the edge,

2911
01:50:00.323 --> 01:50:02.609
but does not roll off the side.

2912
01:50:02.609 --> 01:50:04.875
It just rests a few inches from the edge.

2913
01:50:04.875 --> 01:50:09.181
LIAM: Okay, I release the spell, Frumpkin is gone.

2914
01:50:09.181 --> 01:50:11.357
And--
MATT: All right.

2915
01:50:11.357 --> 01:50:12.689
LIAM: I'll wait until this is resolved.

2916
01:50:12.689 --> 01:50:14.103
MATT: Okay.

2917
01:50:14.103 --> 01:50:15.616
Since you guys made a full run past,

2918
01:50:15.616 --> 01:50:18.548
everyone make another wisdom saving throw for me, please.

2919
01:50:18.548 --> 01:50:21.798
From the terrible river of flesh below.

2920
01:50:23.171 --> 01:50:25.473
SAM: Natural one this time.

2921
01:50:25.473 --> 01:50:28.006
I think my last three rolls have been one, 20, one.

2922
01:50:28.006 --> 01:50:29.022
MATT: Jesus.

2923
01:50:29.022 --> 01:50:30.224
TRAVIS: 16.
MATT: Okay.

2924
01:50:30.224 --> 01:50:31.752
MARISHA: 11 again.
MATT: All right.

2925
01:50:31.752 --> 01:50:33.393
LIAM: 22.

2926
01:50:33.393 --> 01:50:34.676
ASHLEY: Eight.

2927
01:50:36.168 --> 01:50:37.001
TALIESIN: Like 24.

2928
01:50:37.001 --> 01:50:39.158
Who has Bless, by the way, again?

2929
01:50:39.158 --> 01:50:41.470
Okay, and Jester.

2930
01:50:41.470 --> 01:50:42.303
MATT: Okay.

2931
01:50:42.303 --> 01:50:43.753
TRAVIS: And Jester rolled 24.

2932
01:50:43.753 --> 01:50:45.541
MATT: Okay, so Beauregard.

2933
01:50:45.541 --> 01:50:46.542
You--
MARISHA: Yeah.

2934
01:50:46.542 --> 01:50:47.884
MATT: Remain catatonic.

2935
01:50:47.884 --> 01:50:48.835
Just staying in place.

2936
01:50:48.835 --> 01:50:49.869
MARISHA: Okay.
MATT: No big deal.

2937
01:50:49.869 --> 01:50:51.189
MARISHA: As long as I'm not bungee jumping.

2938
01:50:51.189 --> 01:50:53.398
MATT: Nott, you need to roll an attack

2939
01:50:53.398 --> 01:50:55.733
against Jester with your shortsword.

2940
01:50:55.733 --> 01:50:56.719
SAM: She just saved me!

2941
01:50:56.719 --> 01:50:57.552
MATT: I know.

2942
01:50:58.789 --> 01:51:01.321
SAM: That's going to hit, it's 27.

2943
01:51:01.321 --> 01:51:04.828
MATT: Go ahead roll shortsword damage against Jester.

2944
01:51:04.828 --> 01:51:06.011
SAM: No sneak attack damage?

2945
01:51:06.011 --> 01:51:08.411
LIAM: I mean, your ally's nearby.

2946
01:51:08.411 --> 01:51:10.510
MATT: Technically, in that moment,

2947
01:51:10.510 --> 01:51:12.743
nobody else is an ally, so no.

2948
01:51:12.743 --> 01:51:14.332
SAM: Okay.

2949
01:51:14.332 --> 01:51:17.278
MATT: Just a d6, not the full sneak attack.

2950
01:51:17.278 --> 01:51:18.245
SAM: 10 points of damage.

2951
01:51:18.245 --> 01:51:22.339
MATT: 10 points of slashing damage to Jester.

2952
01:51:22.339 --> 01:51:24.728
After just saving Nott, Nott goes, "Thank you."

2953
01:51:24.728 --> 01:51:25.786
(angry grunting)

2954
01:51:25.786 --> 01:51:28.266
Just jams the blade into her side.

2955
01:51:28.266 --> 01:51:29.852
You come back to control again.

2956
01:51:29.852 --> 01:51:31.051
SAM: I'm sorry!

2957
01:51:31.051 --> 01:51:33.709
I'm sorry, Jester, I didn't mean to stab you!

2958
01:51:33.709 --> 01:51:35.109
Thank you for saving my life!

2959
01:51:35.109 --> 01:51:36.039
I'm sorry!

2960
01:51:36.039 --> 01:51:38.684
MATT: Yasha, you remain catatonic.

2961
01:51:38.684 --> 01:51:40.467
You see Yasha just standing there.

2962
01:51:40.467 --> 01:51:42.015
TALIESIN: I'm literally just holding.

2963
01:51:42.015 --> 01:51:43.029
MATT: Okay.

2964
01:51:43.029 --> 01:51:45.392
TALIESIN: I'm going to actually try and move us all.

2965
01:51:45.392 --> 01:51:47.833
MATT: She slowly gives in too and walks.

2966
01:51:47.833 --> 01:51:50.038
Eventually you guys all, at this point,

2967
01:51:50.038 --> 01:51:52.394
are just enough, close to the edge to get off to the side.

2968
01:51:52.394 --> 01:51:54.818
ASHLEY: Good grief.
SAM: The bridge.

2969
01:51:54.818 --> 01:51:56.616
LIAM: While everyone is catching their breath,

2970
01:51:56.616 --> 01:51:58.735
I reapparate Frumpkin in my hand

2971
01:51:58.735 --> 01:52:01.459
and toss him out into the air

2972
01:52:01.459 --> 01:52:03.337
and send him to pick up the cording.

2973
01:52:03.337 --> 01:52:04.459
MARISHA: Yes, good idea.

2974
01:52:04.459 --> 01:52:06.137
MATT: Okay, roll a perception check for Frumpkin.

2975
01:52:06.137 --> 01:52:07.295
LIAM: My bird.

2976
01:52:07.295 --> 01:52:09.264
Don't eat my bird.

2977
01:52:09.264 --> 01:52:10.648
That's a ten.

2978
01:52:10.648 --> 01:52:12.010
MATT: Ten, okay.

2979
01:52:12.010 --> 01:52:14.131
Frumpkin heads back out into the darkness,

2980
01:52:14.131 --> 01:52:16.488
and with the vision,

2981
01:52:16.488 --> 01:52:20.230
is able to rediscover where that platform is,

2982
01:52:21.088 --> 01:52:23.320
snatches up the object, the cord,

2983
01:52:23.320 --> 01:52:24.967
and returns with it in beak.

2984
01:52:24.967 --> 01:52:25.800
LIAM: Bring it to me.

2985
01:52:25.800 --> 01:52:27.527
SAM: It's just a cord.

2986
01:52:27.527 --> 01:52:28.781
MARISHA: It's magical cord.

2987
01:52:28.781 --> 01:52:30.804
LIAM: Cording, you said?

2988
01:52:30.804 --> 01:52:33.895
MATT: Frumpkin brings it back and you guys back away

2989
01:52:33.895 --> 01:52:36.076
into the tunnel about 30 or 40 feet.

2990
01:52:36.076 --> 01:52:38.150
The whispers recede slowly

2991
01:52:38.150 --> 01:52:41.179
and the noise comes to still silence once more.

2992
01:52:41.179 --> 01:52:43.306
Getting it and looking at it, look like a cord now.

2993
01:52:43.306 --> 01:52:48.306
You can see it's a lot of wound, very tightly braided

2994
01:52:48.558 --> 01:52:51.649
bronze colored leather

2995
01:52:51.649 --> 01:52:53.334
with a leather wrapped handle

2996
01:52:53.334 --> 01:52:54.788
and at the very end of one side

2997
01:52:54.788 --> 01:52:57.301
you can see three pronged barbs.

2998
01:52:57.301 --> 01:52:58.671
It's a whip.

2999
01:52:58.671 --> 01:52:59.658
TRAVIS: Ooh!
SAM: Whip?

3000
01:52:59.658 --> 01:53:01.398
A whip?
A magical whip?

3001
01:53:01.398 --> 01:53:02.492
MATT: Seemingly so.

3002
01:53:02.492 --> 01:53:03.325
SAM: Whoa!

3003
01:53:04.391 --> 01:53:05.976
TRAVIS: Jester would like to say:

3004
01:53:05.976 --> 01:53:08.673
(as Jester) We only have like a few more seconds,

3005
01:53:08.673 --> 01:53:11.628
so maybe we should move as far away from banished--

3006
01:53:11.628 --> 01:53:13.438
TALIESIN: I assume we're moving into, yeah.

3007
01:53:13.438 --> 01:53:14.770
MATT: Okay, so you guys move.

3008
01:53:14.770 --> 01:53:16.988
The temperature in this room's gotten noticeably colder

3009
01:53:16.988 --> 01:53:19.750
as you guys begin to move further and further in.

3010
01:53:19.750 --> 01:53:23.893
As you get about 60 or 70 feet into this tunnel,

3011
01:53:23.893 --> 01:53:26.332
it opens up into another chamber.

3012
01:53:26.332 --> 01:53:28.534
Lightless, once more.

3013
01:53:28.534 --> 01:53:31.366
Those of you with darkvision

3014
01:53:31.366 --> 01:53:35.140
can see the smooth stone floor. It's been worked.

3015
01:53:35.140 --> 01:53:37.943
There are walls. It has a strange movement to it

3016
01:53:37.943 --> 01:53:40.663
as you step inside, but there is no light.

3017
01:53:40.663 --> 01:53:44.338
LIAM: If I pull up Dancing Lights,

3018
01:53:44.338 --> 01:53:47.399
does it have the same shrunken in effect as out in the--

3019
01:53:47.399 --> 01:53:48.240
MATT: It does.

3020
01:53:48.240 --> 01:53:49.073
LIAM: Okay.

3021
01:53:49.073 --> 01:53:50.655
MATT: You pull out Dancing Lights?
LIAM: Yes, I do.

3022
01:53:50.655 --> 01:53:52.249
MATT: Okay, as you guys step in,

3023
01:53:52.249 --> 01:53:53.542
Caleb you pull up Dancing Lights

3024
01:53:53.542 --> 01:53:54.670
and as you pull up the four globes,

3025
01:53:54.670 --> 01:53:56.420
you see other globes.

3026
01:53:57.918 --> 01:54:00.548
Like 12 other globes appear in your peripheral

3027
01:54:00.548 --> 01:54:02.132
at different places within the chamber.

3028
01:54:02.132 --> 01:54:03.551
SAM: What?

3029
01:54:03.551 --> 01:54:04.634
LIAM: Hello.

3030
01:54:08.051 --> 01:54:09.801
Stow the whip away.

3031
01:54:12.910 --> 01:54:15.032
TALIESIN: Move one of them.

3032
01:54:15.032 --> 01:54:16.241
LIAM: Yeah, yeah yeah yeah.

3033
01:54:16.241 --> 01:54:17.985
I make all of them move.

3034
01:54:17.985 --> 01:54:21.657
All four of them form like a little diamond pattern

3035
01:54:21.657 --> 01:54:23.037
and move to the right.

3036
01:54:23.037 --> 01:54:25.138
MATT: Okay, all the other globes

3037
01:54:25.138 --> 01:54:26.554
make the same shift at the same time

3038
01:54:26.554 --> 01:54:28.387
in different movement.

3039
01:54:29.886 --> 01:54:34.145
So that moment that you have gathered that this chamber,

3040
01:54:34.145 --> 01:54:35.985
elements of the walls--

3041
01:54:35.985 --> 01:54:38.473
that you can see just from this entrance portion--

3042
01:54:38.473 --> 01:54:42.041
have some sort of reflective surface on them.

3043
01:54:42.041 --> 01:54:43.380
And that's where we're going to go and take a break.

3044
01:54:43.380 --> 01:54:45.802
Because it is 9:00.

3045
01:54:45.802 --> 01:54:47.104
SAM: First half.

3046
01:54:47.104 --> 01:54:48.827
TRAVIS: Are you trying to die?

3047
01:54:48.827 --> 01:54:49.855
Are you trying to die?

3048
01:54:49.855 --> 01:54:52.757
Do you want a create a second character campaign two again?

3049
01:54:52.757 --> 01:54:53.823
Is that what's happening?

3050
01:54:53.823 --> 01:54:56.981
SAM: I'm scared and I need some booze.

3051
01:54:56.981 --> 01:54:59.372
TRAVIS: We're going to have a conversation.

3052
01:54:59.372 --> 01:55:01.230
You're going to come back with less hair.

3053
01:55:01.230 --> 01:55:02.183
SAM: Struggling.

3054
01:55:02.183 --> 01:55:05.463
TRAVIS: Maybe missing an eyebrow, all right?

3055
01:55:05.463 --> 01:55:08.038
MATT: We'll be back here in a few minutes, guys.

3056
01:55:08.038 --> 01:55:10.228
We do have our giveaway tonight

3057
01:55:10.228 --> 01:55:12.645
from our friends at Wyrmwood.

3058
01:55:14.126 --> 01:55:15.531
MARISHA: How long can you hold your breath?

3059
01:55:15.531 --> 01:55:18.633
MATT: We have the zebrawood dice try tonight

3060
01:55:18.633 --> 01:55:21.670
to give away to some lucky person in the chat.

3061
01:55:21.670 --> 01:55:24.723
The keyword for tonight is "bridge."

3062
01:55:24.723 --> 01:55:26.890
Enter it once; any more than once and you'll be

3063
01:55:26.890 --> 01:55:27.982
disqualified.

3064
01:55:27.982 --> 01:55:30.507
For people in the US and Canada, excluding Quebec.

3065
01:55:30.507 --> 01:55:32.634
We'll come back here to the winner shortly.

3066
01:55:32.634 --> 01:55:33.808
See you in a few minutes.

3067
01:55:33.808 --> 01:55:35.566
TRAVIS: Oh my god, that was the first part?

3068
01:55:36.407 --> 01:55:37.557

MATT: Hello, all you wonderful people and critters alike.

3090
01:56:27.229 --> 01:56:28.257
It's been exactly one year

3091
01:56:28.257 --> 01:56:29.266
since I had the chance to

3092
01:56:29.266 --> 01:56:31.953
show you one of my passion projects.

3093
01:56:31.953 --> 01:56:33.247
Which was met with mixed reviews

3094
01:56:33.247 --> 01:56:35.242
from some of my coworkers.

3095
01:56:35.242 --> 01:56:36.435
And wife.

3096
01:56:36.435 --> 01:56:39.336
Over the past year, we've continued development on it,

3097
01:56:39.336 --> 01:56:41.463
and with investment of my own resources,

3098
01:56:41.463 --> 01:56:43.947
I'm super excited to finally reveal to you

3099
01:56:43.947 --> 01:56:48.947
the new and improved Critical Role Land.

3100
01:56:49.128 --> 01:56:50.659
TRAVIS: Oh, what?

3101
01:56:50.659 --> 01:56:52.059
MARISHA: Oh, not again.

3102
01:56:52.059 --> 01:56:55.148
MATT: Guys, we talked about this!

3103
01:56:55.148 --> 01:56:57.996
You're supposed to take my extended design

3104
01:56:57.996 --> 01:57:02.110
and create a fully, giant, immersive experience!

3105
01:57:02.110 --> 01:57:04.785
Full of lasers and audio-visual texture mapping,

3106
01:57:04.785 --> 01:57:08.179
so we could really just give the World's Fair presentation

3107
01:57:08.179 --> 01:57:09.682
on the new Critical Role Land.

3108
01:57:09.682 --> 01:57:11.787
TRAVIS: Wow, I thought you were totally kidding about that.

3109
01:57:11.787 --> 01:57:13.098
MARISHA: Yeah, with what time did you think

3110
01:57:13.098 --> 01:57:14.620
we'd be able to do that?

3111
01:57:14.620 --> 01:57:16.049
MATT: Actually, you make a good point.

3112
01:57:16.049 --> 01:57:17.319
It is the one year anniversary

3113
01:57:17.319 --> 01:57:18.755
of us moving into our own space

3114
01:57:18.755 --> 01:57:20.238
and launching our own channel.

3115
01:57:20.238 --> 01:57:22.533
MARISHA: Yeah, and we've accomplished a ton of stuff

3116
01:57:22.533 --> 01:57:24.476
over the past year, so

3117
01:57:24.476 --> 01:57:26.884
why don't we celebrate that with the critters?

3118
01:57:26.884 --> 01:57:29.755
TRAVIS: Yeah, we could put a pin in the damn laser--

3119
01:57:29.755 --> 01:57:31.520
MATT: Immersive audio-visual experience!

3120
01:57:31.520 --> 01:57:34.111
TRAVIS: Right, a pin in the experience,

3121
01:57:34.111 --> 01:57:37.229
and we could go raise a glass

3122
01:57:37.229 --> 01:57:39.563
over on the not so lonely couch.

3123
01:57:39.563 --> 01:57:40.523
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: Okay, yeah.

3124
01:57:40.523 --> 01:57:41.589
MARISHA: It'll be good.

3125
01:57:41.589 --> 01:57:42.539
It'll be good.

3126
01:57:42.539 --> 01:57:44.033
I know. There's been a lot.

3127
01:57:44.033 --> 01:57:45.425
It's been a lot here lately.

3128
01:57:46.517 --> 01:57:48.222
TRAVIS: Holy hell, this is a lot more people

3129
01:57:48.222 --> 01:57:50.342
than the original announcement.

3130
01:57:50.342 --> 01:57:52.113
MARISHA: Yeah, what are you guys doing here?

3131
01:57:52.113 --> 01:57:53.455
We're trying to shoot a thing.

3132
01:57:53.455 --> 01:57:56.530
DANI: Marisha, we're out of office space, you know this.

3133
01:57:56.530 --> 01:57:57.363
MARISHA: I do.

3134
01:57:57.363 --> 01:58:00.371
Okay, just, can y'all work in Brian's cage

3135
01:58:00.371 --> 01:58:01.680
for just a minute?

3136
01:58:01.680 --> 01:58:02.613
(groaning)

3137
01:58:02.613 --> 01:58:03.446
MATT: Sorry!

3138
01:58:03.446 --> 01:58:04.305
MARISHA: I know, please!

3139
01:58:04.305 --> 01:58:07.135
It's five minutes.

3140
01:58:07.135 --> 01:58:08.052
30 minutes.

3141
01:58:09.421 --> 01:58:10.255
Sorry.

3142
01:58:10.255 --> 01:58:11.088
(beep)

3143
01:58:12.479 --> 01:58:14.274
MARISHA: Sorry about that, guys.

3144
01:58:14.274 --> 01:58:15.107
MATT: Well, as you all can see,

3145
01:58:15.107 --> 01:58:16.415
our humble little company

3146
01:58:16.415 --> 01:58:18.578
has grown quite a bit over this past year.

3147
01:58:18.578 --> 01:58:20.523
TRAVIS: Yeah, staffing up was necessary

3148
01:58:20.523 --> 01:58:22.674
to keep up with all of the projects and endeavors

3149
01:58:22.674 --> 01:58:25.733
we've embarked on since launching this amazing space.

3150
01:58:25.733 --> 01:58:28.087
MARISHA: None of which would've been possible

3151
01:58:28.087 --> 01:58:29.628
had you critters not shown up

3152
01:58:29.628 --> 01:58:31.991
and supported us in a huge way.

3153
01:58:31.991 --> 01:58:32.941
MATT: It's kind of crazy to look back

3154
01:58:32.941 --> 01:58:34.869
and see what we've accomplished this year,

3155
01:58:34.869 --> 01:58:36.292
starting with moving into the studio

3156
01:58:36.292 --> 01:58:38.106
and launching our own channel,

3157
01:58:38.106 --> 01:58:39.872
which was just the start of it really.

3158
01:58:39.872 --> 01:58:42.721
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's see, we had live shows on both coasts,

3159
01:58:42.721 --> 01:58:45.408
in New York and LA, as well as our first art gallery,

3160
01:58:45.408 --> 01:58:47.800
announced the continuation of our comic series,

3161
01:58:47.800 --> 01:58:49.490
Vox Machina Origins with Dark Horse,

3162
01:58:49.490 --> 01:58:53.523
as well as our next art book featuring the Mighty Nein.

3163
01:58:53.523 --> 01:58:55.484
MARISHA: We launched a podcast network,

3164
01:58:55.484 --> 01:58:58.300
produced what feels like a ton of new shows and contents.

3165
01:58:58.300 --> 01:58:59.151
TRAVIS: Pub Draw.

3166
01:58:59.151 --> 01:58:59.984
MATT: Between the Sheets.

3167
01:58:59.984 --> 01:59:00.950
TRAVIS: All Work No Play.

3168
01:59:00.950 --> 01:59:02.050
MATT: Travis Willingham's Yee-Haw Game Ranch.

3169
01:59:02.050 --> 01:59:04.774
MARISHA: Oh god, stop. I'm getting tired already.

3170
01:59:04.774 --> 01:59:07.293
We got our cosplay gallery up and running,

3171
01:59:07.293 --> 01:59:08.733
released some epic merch,

3172
01:59:08.733 --> 01:59:10.552
got our UK store up and running

3173
01:59:10.552 --> 01:59:13.123
to provide previously mentioned epic merch

3174
01:59:13.123 --> 01:59:14.792
to our European critters.

3175
01:59:14.792 --> 01:59:17.449
MATT: Who we got to meet at MCM London this year,

3176
01:59:17.449 --> 01:59:19.350
and we also visited Seattle for the first time

3177
01:59:19.350 --> 01:59:20.675
and Emerald City Comic Con,

3178
01:59:20.675 --> 01:59:22.613
and Denver for Pop Culture Comic Con.

3179
01:59:22.613 --> 01:59:25.779
MATT: We went to New York so that you could run a one-shot

3180
01:59:25.779 --> 01:59:30.386
with Stephen Colbert in collaboration with Red Nose Day

3181
01:59:30.386 --> 01:59:31.552
and their incredible mission.

3182
01:59:33.010 --> 01:59:34.263
MATT: We've really gotten to collaborate with

3183
01:59:34.263 --> 01:59:36.641
several amazing charities and you, the critters,

3184
01:59:36.641 --> 01:59:39.622
have rallied and raised over $300,000 for foundations

3185
01:59:39.622 --> 01:59:41.602
in the past year, including Pablove

3186
01:59:41.602 --> 01:59:43.088
to fight childhood cancer,

3187
01:59:43.088 --> 01:59:44.466
Operation Supply Drop in support of

3188
01:59:44.466 --> 01:59:46.824
active veteran military servicemen and women,

3189
01:59:46.824 --> 01:59:49.350
826LA for child literacy and imagination,

3190
01:59:49.350 --> 01:59:51.965
and, of course, Red Nose Day with Eric the bee

3191
01:59:51.965 --> 01:59:54.453
leading the charge to end childhood poverty.

3192
01:59:54.453 --> 01:59:56.813
TRAVIS: We also launched, unknowingly at the time,

3193
01:59:56.813 --> 01:59:59.181
what ended up being the most successful Kickstarter

3194
01:59:59.181 --> 02:00:01.613
of all time in the film and entertainment category

3195
02:00:01.613 --> 02:00:05.673
and raised over $11 million thanks to you crazy critters

3196
02:00:05.673 --> 02:00:09.760
to produce an animated series featuring Vox Machina.

3197
02:00:09.760 --> 02:00:12.114
MARISHA: We can continue to talk about all the crazy shit

3198
02:00:12.114 --> 02:00:13.248
that's happened this year,

3199
02:00:13.248 --> 02:00:16.241
or we can watch this photo slideshow

3200
02:00:16.241 --> 02:00:17.746
of our favorite moments,

3201
02:00:17.746 --> 02:00:19.867
brought to you by the CR Production Team

3202
02:00:19.867 --> 02:00:23.261
and the Old Mill Elementary School Yearbook Committee.

02:00:23.261 --> 02:00:25.250
Set to a royalty free sound-alike

3204
02:00:25.250 --> 02:00:27.824

3205
02:00:27.824 --> 02:00:28.657
Enjoy.

We are so excited for the things

3234
02:01:57.855 --> 02:01:59.638
we have planned this coming year.

3235
02:01:59.638 --> 02:02:01.056
We get to continue to share in

3236
02:02:01.056 --> 02:02:03.082
this crazy reality with all of you.

3237
02:02:03.082 --> 02:02:04.790
MARISHA: None of this would be possible

3238
02:02:04.790 --> 02:02:06.634
without the continued love and support

3239
02:02:06.634 --> 02:02:09.284
from this incredible community.

3240
02:02:09.284 --> 02:02:11.288
MATT: We love you all so very much.

3241
02:02:11.288 --> 02:02:13.330
Your belief in us is what keeps us going.

3242
02:02:13.330 --> 02:02:15.971
Now it's time for us to get back to work on the

3243
02:02:15.971 --> 02:02:18.137
tech-forward, advanced, laser-light immersive,

3244
02:02:18.137 --> 02:02:20.951
audio-visual experience and the currently working title

3245
02:02:20.951 --> 02:02:22.017
of CR Land.

3246
02:02:22.017 --> 02:02:22.850
(phone ringing)
TRAVIS: Oh gosh.

3247
02:02:22.850 --> 02:02:23.783
You know what?

3248
02:02:23.783 --> 02:02:27.382
We-- about that-- oh sorry, call.

3249
02:02:27.382 --> 02:02:28.731
MATT: That's fine, Marisha. We can go ahead.

3250
02:02:28.731 --> 02:02:33.128
MARISHA: Actually, you know-- I have to-- Max needs--

3251
02:02:33.128 --> 02:02:34.961
Brian wants something.

3252
02:02:36.866 --> 02:02:38.277
MATT: Wait, Max is Brian?

3253
02:02:38.277 --> 02:02:39.777
That doesn't even...

3254
02:02:41.017 --> 02:02:43.068
Where'd everyone go?

3255
02:02:43.068 --> 02:02:45.217
I guess it is the lonely couch after all.

3256
02:02:45.217 --> 02:02:48.034
(ominous music)

3257
02:02:48.034 --> 02:02:49.425
The fools.

3258
02:02:51.208 --> 02:02:52.041
Well then,

3259
02:02:52.994 --> 02:02:55.822
if they won't help me build CR Land,

3260
02:02:55.822 --> 02:02:58.405
I'll just have to do it myself.

I don't know what, all I know about this

3274
02:03:48.689 --> 02:03:50.743
is that it's basically Harry Potter with ninjas.

3275
02:03:50.743 --> 02:03:51.576
ERICA: Kakashi!

3276
02:03:51.576 --> 02:03:52.856
Okay, let me get in here.

3277

ERICA: Do I do this?

3278

I'm on this one, right?

It's this one, this one, and this one,

3281
02:03:57.469 --> 02:04:00.268
and I think you press down to go through the text.

3282
02:04:00.268 --> 02:04:02.092
ERICA: Sexy Jutsu!
Ah!

3283
02:04:02.092 --> 02:04:03.168
What!

3284
02:04:03.168 --> 02:04:05.337
They have Sexy Jutsu in this?

3285
02:04:06.529 --> 02:04:08.066
TALIESIN: I hope somebody out there knows

3286
02:04:08.066 --> 02:04:09.187
what's happening right now,

3287
02:04:09.187 --> 02:04:12.296
because I've lost all notion.

3288
02:04:12.296 --> 02:04:14.526
ERICA: Listen, he keeps turning into a brick!

3289
02:04:14.526 --> 02:04:15.359
Oh, well, we're done!

3290
02:04:15.359 --> 02:04:16.893
TALIESIN: It's okay--
ERICA: Oh my god!

3291
02:04:16.893 --> 02:04:18.096
It's Tuxedo Mask!

3292
02:04:18.096 --> 02:04:19.397
TALIESIN: Tuxedo Mask's here. Everything's fine.

3293
02:04:19.397 --> 02:04:21.045
Oh he left, nevermind.

3294
02:04:21.045 --> 02:04:22.609
ERICA: He literally-- I'm sorry.

3295
02:04:22.609 --> 02:04:23.939
Wait, I'm sorry.

3296
02:04:23.939 --> 02:04:26.276
Wait, you give me a brief moment here.

3297
02:04:26.276 --> 02:04:28.955
TALIESIN: (laughs)

3298
02:04:28.955 --> 02:04:30.660
ERICA: Literally?
TALIESIN: That was the perfect thing.

3299
02:04:30.660 --> 02:04:32.158
I couldn't have been happier with that.

3300
02:04:33.758 --> 02:04:35.253
ERICA: Okay, I'm here to fight again.
TALIESIN: Oh man.

3301
02:04:35.253 --> 02:04:36.664
ERICA: I'm getting stressed by this.

3302
02:04:36.664 --> 02:04:38.490
TALIESIN: Oh why? There's no stakes.

3303
02:04:38.490 --> 02:04:41.153
Literally the stakes could not be lower if we tried.

3304
02:04:41.153 --> 02:04:42.180
ERICA: I don't want turbo, oh god.

3305
02:04:42.180 --> 02:04:43.063
TALIESIN: I don't know what turbo would

3306
02:04:43.063 --> 02:04:43.896
do to us, to be fair.

3307
02:04:43.896 --> 02:04:45.943
ERICA: Ooh, he's like, I want to--

3308
02:04:45.943 --> 02:04:47.975
TALIESIN: (deep posh voice) Yes, no, he's very there.

3309
02:04:47.975 --> 02:04:50.257
ERICA: There you go, there you go. He totally is!

3310
02:04:50.257 --> 02:04:51.366
TALIESIN: Yes, it's all right there.

3311
02:04:51.366 --> 02:04:52.648
ERICA: Do you do voice overs?

3312
02:04:52.648 --> 02:04:54.325
TALIESIN: (normal voice) I mean, not lately, but I--

3313
02:04:54.325 --> 02:04:55.579
ERICA: Oh I love it!

3314
02:04:55.579 --> 02:04:56.979
Look at his long fingers!

3315
02:04:58.954 --> 02:04:59.871
TALIESIN: Very you.

3316
02:05:01.037 --> 02:05:02.269
ERICA: Long fingers?

3317
02:05:02.269 --> 02:05:04.333
Classic Erica, long fingers.

3318
02:05:04.333 --> 02:05:05.885
I did the voice of Barbie

3319
02:05:05.885 --> 02:05:08.153
pretty regularly for like two and a half years.

3320
02:05:09.078 --> 02:05:10.546
Yep.

3321
02:05:10.546 --> 02:05:12.834
The way I got into character was I would either go,

3322
02:05:12.834 --> 02:05:14.195
(as Barbie) Hi, I'm Barbie.

3323
02:05:14.195 --> 02:05:15.109
I'm Barbie!

3324
02:05:15.109 --> 02:05:16.320
I'm Barbie.

3325
02:05:16.320 --> 02:05:18.747
Or I would go, (as Barbie) wow, that's so cool!

3326
02:05:18.747 --> 02:05:20.934
Wow, that's so cool!

3327
02:05:20.934 --> 02:05:22.130
TALIESIN: I may have to restart.

3328
02:05:22.130 --> 02:05:22.963
ERICA: No!

3329
02:05:22.963 --> 02:05:24.066
TALIESIN: I'm going to try again. I'm going to try

3330
02:05:24.066 --> 02:05:26.425
the other file. See if it works better.

3331
02:05:26.425 --> 02:05:27.258
Maybe.
ERICA: Okay.

3332
02:05:27.258 --> 02:05:29.723
California Raisin's The Grape Escape.

3333
02:05:29.723 --> 02:05:30.736
I'm going to have to come back.

3334
02:05:30.736 --> 02:05:32.221
TALIESIN: I mean, there's a reason I put that there, too.

3335
02:05:32.221 --> 02:05:34.956
This list was specifically curated for you.

3336
02:05:34.956 --> 02:05:35.789
ERICA: Aw.
TALIESIN: I mean,

3337
02:05:35.789 --> 02:05:37.872
I wanted you to know that I understood you.

3338
02:05:37.872 --> 02:05:39.128
ERICA: (as Barbie) That's so cool, Taliesin.

3339
02:05:39.128 --> 02:05:40.794
You're my best friend.

3340
02:05:40.794 --> 02:05:42.031
I love that shirt on you!

3341
02:05:42.031 --> 02:05:43.963
TALIESIN: That is the scariest fucking shit!

3342
02:05:43.963 --> 02:05:45.107
Oh my god, that voice.

3343
02:05:45.107 --> 02:05:46.366
ERICA: That is such a cool hair color!

3344
02:05:46.366 --> 02:05:47.252
TALIESIN: Oh god.

3345
02:05:47.252 --> 02:05:48.678
ERICA: I always wanted to put pink in my hair!

3346
02:05:48.678 --> 02:05:50.014
TALIESIN: Oh god, I'm going to have nightmares.

3347
02:05:50.014 --> 02:05:51.493
I'm going to have nightmares. Oh my god.

3348
02:05:51.493 --> 02:05:52.977
ERICA: Hi, I'm Barbie.

3349
02:05:52.977 --> 02:05:55.886
TALIESIN: Oh, god.
ERICA: Hi, I'm Barbie!

3350
02:05:55.886 --> 02:05:56.922
Hi!

3351
02:05:56.922 --> 02:05:58.156
But, yawn!

3352
02:05:58.156 --> 02:06:00.057
(silly voice) I'm getting sleepy now.

3353
02:06:00.057 --> 02:06:02.270
TALIESIN: You just ruined everything, dammit.

3354
02:06:02.270 --> 02:06:03.103
ERICA: I don't even know if I want to play it.

3355
02:06:03.103 --> 02:06:04.078
I feel like it's cursed.

3356
02:06:04.078 --> 02:06:04.962
TALIESIN: It is cursed, actually.

3357
02:06:04.962 --> 02:06:05.795
ERICA: You're already cursed, I mean,

3358
02:06:05.795 --> 02:06:07.986
having been alive since 1100 AD, like.

3359
02:06:07.986 --> 02:06:08.819
TALIESIN: This is why.

3360
02:06:08.819 --> 02:06:10.352
As long as I play this game every day,

3361
02:06:10.352 --> 02:06:11.295
I get an extra day of life.

3362
02:06:11.295 --> 02:06:12.329
ERICA: This is why you made me do it.

3363
02:06:12.329 --> 02:06:14.089
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, this is just one more day of life.

3364
02:06:14.089 --> 02:06:16.638
ERICA: Jeez, it's like the monkey's paw.

3365
02:06:16.638 --> 02:06:18.841
TALIESIN: I know, it's terrible.

3366
02:06:18.841 --> 02:06:21.329
BRIAN (V.O.): Last time on Talks Machina.

3367
02:06:21.329 --> 02:06:23.032
BRIAN: Beau just gave Nott some wine,

3368
02:06:23.032 --> 02:06:24.811
knowing she had been sober recently.

3369
02:06:24.811 --> 02:06:26.706
What are her thoughts that led her to that

3370
02:06:26.706 --> 02:06:28.875
after she tossed her the bottle?

3371
02:06:28.875 --> 02:06:30.637
Let's toss it over to you for the booze question.

3372
02:06:30.637 --> 02:06:31.470
MARISHA: Oh, man.

3373
02:06:31.470 --> 02:06:33.803
I knew this was going to be like one of the first ones.

3374
02:06:38.017 --> 02:06:38.850
I don't know.

3375
02:06:38.850 --> 02:06:41.242
Beau has made it clear,

3376
02:06:42.253 --> 02:06:45.827
sometimes controversially so,

3377
02:06:47.240 --> 02:06:52.240
in the past, about letting people have the right to choose

3378
02:06:52.439 --> 02:06:54.212
if they want to be pieces of shit

3379
02:06:54.212 --> 02:06:58.515
or take a bowl that belongs to an ancient god

3380
02:06:58.515 --> 02:07:02.690
as a communication device and do whatever they want with it.

3381
02:07:04.657 --> 02:07:06.274
So yeah.

3382
02:07:06.274 --> 02:07:08.702
I think, in Beau's head, she was like,

3383
02:07:08.702 --> 02:07:12.867
here, end of day. We're about to rest for eight hours,

3384
02:07:12.867 --> 02:07:14.041
and it's like a little.

3385
02:07:14.041 --> 02:07:17.715
I saw a lot of theories about how much wine she chugged.

3386
02:07:17.715 --> 02:07:18.800
It wasn't that much wine, you guys.

3387
02:07:18.800 --> 02:07:20.083
LAURA: It was like a glass of wine.

3388
02:07:20.083 --> 02:07:20.916
MARISHA: Yeah, it was like the equivalent

3389
02:07:20.916 --> 02:07:21.749
of a glass of wine.

3390
02:07:21.749 --> 02:07:22.582
LAURA: Yeah.
BRIAN: Like in

3391
02:07:22.582 --> 02:07:23.415
Infinity War when they--

3392
02:07:23.415 --> 02:07:24.337
LAURA: Stop.

3393
02:07:26.768 --> 02:07:28.369
BRIAN: Laura--
DANI: That was a lot.

3394
02:07:28.369 --> 02:07:29.905
BRIAN: Answer this question and

3395
02:07:29.905 --> 02:07:32.277
remove eye contact from me at once.

3396
02:07:32.277 --> 02:07:34.277
Meg M. Hannah wants to know--

3397
02:07:34.277 --> 02:07:35.822
you guys don't know what this feels like.

3398
02:07:35.822 --> 02:07:38.028
You don't know what this feels like.

3399
02:07:39.078 --> 02:07:42.023
LAURA: It's just a fucking bad idea to sleep in there.

3400
02:07:42.023 --> 02:07:46.365
Like, the dude knows we're coming after him.

3401
02:07:47.470 --> 02:07:50.076
We're in a really dangerous location.

3402
02:07:51.334 --> 02:07:52.564
You want my personal opinion

3403
02:07:52.564 --> 02:07:54.456
and I hope I'm proven wrong.

3404
02:07:54.456 --> 02:07:56.509
I don't think Matt's going to make our--

3405
02:07:56.509 --> 02:07:58.407
going to let us have a long rest.

3406
02:07:58.407 --> 02:08:00.384
I don't think--
BRIAN: You don't think so?

3407
02:08:00.384 --> 02:08:01.217
LAURA: No.

3408
02:08:01.217 --> 02:08:04.527
I think that it's going to not be able to happen

3409
02:08:04.527 --> 02:08:07.226
and I just wasted two spells at the end

3410
02:08:07.226 --> 02:08:09.321
because they were asking me to do it,

3411
02:08:09.321 --> 02:08:10.178
so I did it, but--

3412
02:08:10.178 --> 02:08:12.686
MARISHA: I think the spell casters have to sleep.

3413
02:08:12.686 --> 02:08:14.378
LAURA: We have to. We have nothing left.

3414
02:08:14.378 --> 02:08:16.943
Because that's the point of these kind of dungeon crawls

3415
02:08:16.943 --> 02:08:18.710
is that you use up your fucking spells

3416
02:08:18.710 --> 02:08:19.998
before you get to the big thing.

3417
02:08:19.998 --> 02:08:21.126
MARISHA: Spell conservation, man.

3418
02:08:21.126 --> 02:08:23.716
LAURA: And we didn't conserve, so.

3419
02:08:23.716 --> 02:08:24.858
MARISHA: It's a big deal.

3420
02:08:24.858 --> 02:08:27.252
LAURA: If we don't rest, we will all die,

3421
02:08:27.252 --> 02:08:30.569
because the spell casters are not able to sustain the group.

3422
02:08:30.569 --> 02:08:33.290
BRIAN: How could you have conserved much more, though?

3423
02:08:33.290 --> 02:08:34.761
Given the circumstances?

3424
02:08:34.761 --> 02:08:36.093
MARISHA: Being a spell caster sucks,

3425
02:08:36.093 --> 02:08:37.857
because sometimes there are those rounds

3426
02:08:37.857 --> 02:08:40.388
where you definitely want to do something effective, but--

3427
02:08:40.388 --> 02:08:41.221
LAURA: Yeah.

3428
02:08:41.221 --> 02:08:42.979
MARISHA: --you should probably just--
BRIAN: Save your shit.

3429
02:08:42.979 --> 02:08:44.895
MARISHA: You should probably just do a cantrip.

3430
02:08:44.895 --> 02:08:47.001
That was the worst realization that I had as Keyleth.

3431
02:08:47.001 --> 02:08:48.077
I think there was one time,

3432
02:08:48.077 --> 02:08:50.081
I think it was during the Briarwood Arc,

3433
02:08:50.081 --> 02:08:53.795
and I depleted a ton of spells, and I was like,

3434
02:08:53.795 --> 02:08:54.628
"I have to sleep,"

3435
02:08:54.628 --> 02:08:55.464
and I don't think we did.

3436
02:08:55.464 --> 02:08:56.297
LAURA: Yeah.

3437
02:08:56.297 --> 02:08:59.140
MARISHA: I think I got overruled in the group.

3438
02:08:59.140 --> 02:09:01.586
We're like, nope, we're keeping going.

3439
02:09:01.586 --> 02:09:02.849
DANI: Not a lot of spell casters in Vox Machina.

3440
02:09:02.849 --> 02:09:04.545
MARISHA: There wasn't a lot of spell casters.

3441
02:09:04.545 --> 02:09:05.378
BRIAN: Yeah.

3442
02:09:05.378 --> 02:09:07.946
MARISHA: And Keyleth wasn't going to protest that much.

3443
02:09:08.913 --> 02:09:12.931
So and I remembered after that, I was like, "Fuck."

3444
02:09:12.931 --> 02:09:13.764
LAURA: Yeah.

3445
02:09:13.764 --> 02:09:15.613
This is stupid.
MARISHA: It's a lesson.

3446
02:09:15.613 --> 02:09:16.979
BRIAN: Our winner for this week

3447
02:09:16.979 --> 02:09:21.072
was sent in by Andy @Aheroofhearts,

02:09:25.303 --> 02:09:26.620
which is short for cosplay.

3450
02:09:26.620 --> 02:09:28.243
I think they ran out of characters when they wrote up.

3451
02:09:28.243 --> 02:09:29.929
LAURA: Yeah, that happens.

3452
02:09:29.929 --> 02:09:32.331
BRIAN: Let's take a look.

3453
02:09:32.331 --> 02:09:34.122
ALL: Whoa!

3454
02:09:34.122 --> 02:09:35.985
DANI: Look at that Fjord!

3455
02:09:35.985 --> 02:09:36.818
MARISHA: That's amazing!
BRIAN: Look at

3456
02:09:36.818 --> 02:09:37.651
that sword.

3457
02:09:37.651 --> 02:09:39.186
LAURA: Look at that falchion!

3458
02:09:39.186 --> 02:09:40.267
MARISHA: Where is he?

3459
02:09:40.267 --> 02:09:41.993
BRIAN: I don't know, but I want to go to there.

3460
02:09:41.993 --> 02:09:43.842
LAURA: I know. Me, too.

3461
02:09:43.842 --> 02:09:44.675
That's awesome.

3462
02:09:44.675 --> 02:09:46.334
MARISHA: That's just such a cool photo!

3463
02:09:46.334 --> 02:09:48.366
BRIAN: Why do I feel like we've met him?

3464
02:09:48.366 --> 02:09:49.845
Does he look familiar?

3465
02:09:49.845 --> 02:09:51.039
He looks familiar to me.

3466
02:09:51.039 --> 02:09:53.187
DANI: Well, Fjord's in the show every week.

3467
02:09:53.187 --> 02:09:56.216
BRIAN: That's what it is. Thank you, Dani.

3468
02:09:56.216 --> 02:09:57.234
LAURA: Oh my gosh!

3469
02:09:57.234 --> 02:09:59.383
He looks so handsome!
MARISHA: So good!

3470
02:09:59.383 --> 02:10:00.248
Hee hee!

3471
02:10:00.248 --> 02:10:01.292
BRIAN: That was awesome.

3472
02:10:01.292 --> 02:10:06.234
(dramatic music)

3473
02:23:25.838 --> 02:23:27.313
MATT: And welcome back, everybody.

3474
02:23:27.313 --> 02:23:28.946
(laughter)

3475
02:23:28.946 --> 02:23:30.403
MATT: We have our winner for the giveaway.

3476
02:23:30.403 --> 02:23:32.895
The winner is Jadivone.

3477
02:23:34.170 --> 02:23:35.719
Jadivone, congratulations,

3478
02:23:35.719 --> 02:23:38.238
we'll get that sent out to you ASAP.

3479
02:23:38.238 --> 02:23:39.901
So--
MARISHA: Hey,

3480
02:23:39.901 --> 02:23:41.485
happy channel-versary, everybody.

3481
02:23:41.485 --> 02:23:43.801
(cheering)

3482
02:23:43.801 --> 02:23:45.442
MARISHA: Happy channel-versary.

3483
02:23:45.442 --> 02:23:48.282
LIAM: Happy channel-versary, Laura!

3484
02:23:48.282 --> 02:23:49.982
TRAVIS: Love you, Laura-booloo.

3485
02:23:49.982 --> 02:23:52.455
ASHLEY: What's the first anniversary present?

3486
02:23:52.455 --> 02:23:53.312
MARISHA: Paper?

3487
02:23:54.262 --> 02:23:55.251
TALIESIN: Is it paper?

3488
02:23:55.251 --> 02:23:56.084
SAM: Yep.

3489
02:23:56.084 --> 02:23:58.342
I got you all $500.

3490
02:24:00.532 --> 02:24:01.365
TRAVIS: Oh, good.

3491
02:24:01.365 --> 02:24:03.209
MATT: Thank you, Sam. That's really sweet.

3492
02:24:03.209 --> 02:24:04.334
TALIESIN: Non-sequential.
MATT: I'll hold you to that.

3493
02:24:05.826 --> 02:24:07.807
So.
TRAVIS: Oh, god.

3494
02:24:07.807 --> 02:24:09.091
MATT: Last we left off,

3495
02:24:09.091 --> 02:24:12.421
you guys had managed to cross the bridge,

3496
02:24:12.421 --> 02:24:15.190
head a bit of ways through the proceeding tunnel,

3497
02:24:15.190 --> 02:24:17.523
and have just now entered a new chamber.

3498
02:24:17.523 --> 02:24:22.482
Cold, cut stone walls, about 15 feet tall to the ceiling,

3499
02:24:24.946 --> 02:24:28.796
and reflective surfaces on some of these

3500
02:24:28.796 --> 02:24:31.494
strange chamber walls.

3501
02:24:31.494 --> 02:24:32.823
TRAVIS: Can we tell about how far away

3502
02:24:32.823 --> 02:24:35.496
those reflections seem to be?

3503
02:24:35.496 --> 02:24:36.329
MATT: There's one of them

3504
02:24:36.329 --> 02:24:38.326
maybe five feet from where you're standing.

3505
02:24:38.326 --> 02:24:40.059
TALIESIN: Does anybody mind if I

3506
02:24:40.059 --> 02:24:42.300
up the light in here a little bit?

3507
02:24:43.186 --> 02:24:44.949
SAM: We've already got Dancing Lights going, right?

3508
02:24:44.949 --> 02:24:47.355
MATT: They're like five foot orbs that give off--

3509
02:24:47.355 --> 02:24:50.288
TALIESIN: I'm going to pick one of the orbs

3510
02:24:50.288 --> 02:24:51.763
to cast the Light spell on

3511
02:24:51.763 --> 02:24:54.544
to just give it a little bit more oomph.

3512
02:24:54.544 --> 02:24:56.497
MATT: The orb technically is not an object.

3513
02:24:56.497 --> 02:24:58.645
TALIESIN: Oh, then I just do it on my staff.

3514
02:24:58.645 --> 02:25:02.320
MATT: Okay, so your staff lights up.

3515
02:25:03.834 --> 02:25:05.145
About a 30 foot range

3516
02:25:05.145 --> 02:25:07.406
and from that you can see now on some of these surfaces

3517
02:25:07.406 --> 02:25:09.834
the light reflecting from various

3518
02:25:09.834 --> 02:25:11.585
mirrored surfaces on the way in.

3519
02:25:11.585 --> 02:25:12.836
LIAM: So actual mirrors?

3520
02:25:12.836 --> 02:25:14.412
MATT: It looks to be, yeah.

3521
02:25:14.412 --> 02:25:15.306
Like the edges of them,

3522
02:25:15.306 --> 02:25:17.645
you can see some of them are pushed into the rock

3523
02:25:17.645 --> 02:25:20.430
and wrapping around it, or at least embedded within.

3524
02:25:20.430 --> 02:25:23.029
You can see broken shards and some edges of the corners

3525
02:25:23.029 --> 02:25:26.154
where it's either been broken over time or itself was not

3526
02:25:26.154 --> 02:25:28.465
an imperfect mirrored surface.

3527
02:25:28.465 --> 02:25:32.723
TALIESIN: Are these just reflective mirrored surfaces

3528
02:25:32.723 --> 02:25:36.340
or is this like someone filled a cave full of mirrors?

3529
02:25:36.340 --> 02:25:38.447
Do some of them have frames, or...?

3530
02:25:38.447 --> 02:25:39.685
MATT: There are no frames.
TALIESIN: All right.

3531
02:25:40.535 --> 02:25:41.915
MATT: You do see, some of them,

3532
02:25:41.915 --> 02:25:44.009
a lot of them are embedded into the wall.

3533
02:25:44.009 --> 02:25:46.599
Some of them are leaning against a bit,

3534
02:25:46.599 --> 02:25:49.935
and some are broken bits on the ground.

3535
02:25:49.935 --> 02:25:51.983
It's an imperfect construction.

3536
02:25:51.983 --> 02:25:53.538
TALIESIN: But it feels like a construction?

3537
02:25:53.538 --> 02:25:54.856
MATT: It feels intentional, yes.

3538
02:25:54.856 --> 02:25:59.221
MARISHA: It's not because of like a shiny, super shiny onyx

3539
02:25:59.221 --> 02:26:00.499
that makes a reflective surface?

3540
02:26:00.499 --> 02:26:01.604
MATT: No, no.
MARISHA: Okay.

3541
02:26:01.604 --> 02:26:03.455
MATT: It's like a smooth, polished mirror.

3542
02:26:04.630 --> 02:26:05.463
TALIESIN: Is anything in this room

3543
02:26:05.463 --> 02:26:06.763
making my spider sense tingle?

3544
02:26:08.121 --> 02:26:08.954
MATT: In what way?

3545
02:26:08.954 --> 02:26:10.440
TALIESIN: Just any writing on the wall.

3546
02:26:10.440 --> 02:26:13.223
Does there seem like there's a path through any of this?

3547
02:26:13.223 --> 02:26:14.447
MATT: You can make a perception check.

3548
02:26:14.447 --> 02:26:16.164
TALIESIN: I'll make a perception check.

3549
02:26:18.537 --> 02:26:19.825
16.

3550
02:26:19.825 --> 02:26:20.742
MATT: 16, okay.

3551
02:26:23.877 --> 02:26:27.335
Looking ahead it curves to the right and left

3552
02:26:27.335 --> 02:26:29.997
and then splits and you can see the hall continues forward.

3553
02:26:29.997 --> 02:26:32.612
It's about 10 feet wide, sometimes 15.

3554
02:26:32.612 --> 02:26:37.134
The shape is-- it changes in spaces.

3555
02:26:37.134 --> 02:26:40.520
Meaning it gets wider and then thinner in others.

3556
02:26:40.520 --> 02:26:43.138
It's strange. The cavern in some ways is very refined,

3557
02:26:43.138 --> 02:26:45.497
and then some ways also very rough and natural.

3558
02:26:46.730 --> 02:26:49.446
From what you can gather, the edge of some of the mirrors,

3559
02:26:49.446 --> 02:26:51.129
a bit of frost has gathered

3560
02:26:51.129 --> 02:26:55.594
or some sort of a dirt or dust is on the edges.

3561
02:26:55.594 --> 02:26:56.787
It is cold in this chamber.

3562
02:26:56.787 --> 02:26:58.146
You can start seeing your breath

3563
02:26:58.146 --> 02:26:59.776
a little bit in front of you.

3564
02:26:59.776 --> 02:27:02.126
TALIESIN: Does anyone want to take a few minutes for healing

3565
02:27:02.126 --> 02:27:04.981
or anything like that before we move forward?

3566
02:27:06.481 --> 02:27:08.705
I'm going to take a few minutes where everyone can sit

3567
02:27:08.705 --> 02:27:12.589
while I do a healing-- what's the word I'm looking for?

3568
02:27:12.589 --> 02:27:13.659
Prayer of Healing.

3569
02:27:13.659 --> 02:27:14.559
MATT: Prayer of Healing, all right.

3570
02:27:14.559 --> 02:27:15.392
You can go ahead and do that.

3571
02:27:15.392 --> 02:27:16.225
TRAVIS: (as Jester) Oh thank you Caduceus,

3572
02:27:16.225 --> 02:27:18.118
you are so handsome.

3573
02:27:18.118 --> 02:27:21.824
MARISHA: Do the mirrors appear to be pointed

3574
02:27:21.824 --> 02:27:24.603
and seem to be facing a particular direction?

3575
02:27:24.603 --> 02:27:27.790
Do they appear to be arranged deliberately?

3576
02:27:27.790 --> 02:27:30.017
MATT: From the entrance point?

3577
02:27:30.017 --> 02:27:30.981
Are you guys entering the chamber

3578
02:27:30.981 --> 02:27:32.119
or are you all still staying at the entrance?

3579
02:27:32.119 --> 02:27:33.114
LIAM: I'm hanging back.

3580
02:27:33.114 --> 02:27:33.953
TALIESIN: I think we're hanging back.

3581
02:27:33.953 --> 02:27:35.961
MATT: Okay, you're all hanging back. From what you can see,

3582
02:27:35.961 --> 02:27:38.455
the directions all face--

3583
02:27:38.455 --> 02:27:41.278
and you can't see much beyond just where the area splits

3584
02:27:41.278 --> 02:27:43.052
and then goes out of your view

3585
02:27:43.052 --> 02:27:45.657
because it curves beyond your visual range,

3586
02:27:45.657 --> 02:27:47.509
but they appear to have many different angles

3587
02:27:47.509 --> 02:27:49.068
from what you can tell.

3588
02:27:49.068 --> 02:27:49.901
MARISHA: Okay.

3589
02:27:49.901 --> 02:27:50.734
MATT: They're not all pointed

3590
02:27:50.734 --> 02:27:52.062
or focused in a specific direction.

3591
02:27:52.062 --> 02:27:53.226
MARISHA: Okay.

3592
02:27:53.226 --> 02:27:54.706
TALIESIN: Just checking really quickly.

3593
02:27:54.706 --> 02:27:58.019
Who in this group wants healing other than Jester?

3594
02:27:58.019 --> 02:28:00.486
TRAVIS: I'm down eight.
MARISHA: I'm down six.

3595
02:28:00.486 --> 02:28:01.661
LIAM: I'm down very little,

3596
02:28:01.661 --> 02:28:03.461
but every little bit counts for me.

3597
02:28:03.461 --> 02:28:04.619
SAM: I'm down 14.

3598
02:28:06.344 --> 02:28:08.460
TALIESIN: And you're down-- you're not down at all.

3599
02:28:08.460 --> 02:28:11.387
So that's one, two, three, four, five.

3600
02:28:11.387 --> 02:28:12.275
I can do everybody.

3601
02:28:12.275 --> 02:28:14.514
Everybody gets 15.

3602
02:28:14.514 --> 02:28:16.814
TRAVIS: 15.
MARISHA: Oh, beautiful.

3603
02:28:16.814 --> 02:28:21.088
LIAM: If I get reasonably close to one of these mirrors

3604
02:28:21.088 --> 02:28:25.725
and study this frosting, can I make out anything,

3605
02:28:25.725 --> 02:28:27.308
any more detail or...?

3606
02:28:28.152 --> 02:28:29.462
MATT: What are you trying to figure out?

3607
02:28:29.462 --> 02:28:33.190
LIAM: Is this something that is happening from environment

3608
02:28:33.190 --> 02:28:34.317
and temperature in here or

3609
02:28:34.317 --> 02:28:37.102
does it look like it has been spat on these mirrors?

3610
02:28:38.844 --> 02:28:40.405
MATT: Make a nature check.

3611
02:28:40.405 --> 02:28:42.713
TRAVIS: As the healing takes place I'll say:

3612
02:28:42.713 --> 02:28:44.698
Thank you, Wildmother.

3613
02:28:44.698 --> 02:28:46.724
MARISHA: Aw.
MATT: Okay.

3614
02:28:46.724 --> 02:28:48.849
SAM: Thank you what?
TRAVIS: Wildmother.

3615
02:28:52.405 --> 02:28:53.975
LIAM: 24.
MATT: 24.

3616
02:28:53.975 --> 02:28:57.558
The frost that's gathered on these mirrors,

3617
02:28:58.696 --> 02:29:01.529
you look at it and it's less--

3618
02:29:02.769 --> 02:29:07.436
it resembles frost but it looks like bits of dust and...

3619
02:29:10.132 --> 02:29:12.180
Just dust has gathered on the edges of it.

3620
02:29:12.180 --> 02:29:13.838
It is cold in here, but it's not cold enough

3621
02:29:13.838 --> 02:29:16.039
for it do be gathering actual frost.

3622
02:29:16.039 --> 02:29:17.216
It just has that like--

3623
02:29:17.216 --> 02:29:18.439
the edges of the mirrors themselves

3624
02:29:18.439 --> 02:29:19.961
look a bit frosted as it goes

3625
02:29:19.961 --> 02:29:21.764
a little more opaque on the edges.

3626
02:29:21.764 --> 02:29:22.597
LIAM: Okay.

3627
02:29:25.045 --> 02:29:26.187
Good.

3628
02:29:26.187 --> 02:29:28.520
TALIESIN: We could, just to...

3629
02:29:29.437 --> 02:29:32.145
not to slow us down anymore, but

3630
02:29:33.646 --> 02:29:37.744
we do have an angel we could have a conversation with

3631
02:29:37.744 --> 02:29:41.110
if we wanted to do that really quickly, too.

3632
02:29:41.110 --> 02:29:42.506
SAM: Yasha?

3633
02:29:42.506 --> 02:29:43.339
MARISHA: Me?

3634
02:29:44.647 --> 02:29:45.480
TALIESIN: Jester?

3635
02:29:46.500 --> 02:29:50.827
Can you hand me the-- our friend we picked up?

3636
02:29:50.827 --> 02:29:51.926
SAM: Oh!

3637
02:29:51.926 --> 02:29:53.737
TRAVIS: (as Jester) What friend are you talking about?

3638
02:29:53.737 --> 02:29:54.836
TALIESIN: She knows.

3639
02:29:55.961 --> 02:29:56.794
TRAVIS: (as Jester) I know.

3640
02:29:58.395 --> 02:29:59.228
TRAVIS: What is it?

3641
02:29:59.228 --> 02:30:00.061
SAM: I am Borat.

3642
02:30:00.061 --> 02:30:03.635
(laughter)

3643
02:30:03.635 --> 02:30:05.009
ASHLEY: (as Borat) My wife.

3644
02:30:05.009 --> 02:30:05.940
SAM: (as Borat) My wife.

3645
02:30:05.940 --> 02:30:07.073
LIAM: I was thinking Swiss Miss.

3646
02:30:10.437 --> 02:30:11.273
(groaning)

3647
02:30:11.273 --> 02:30:12.106
MARISHA: So close.

3648
02:30:13.328 --> 02:30:16.066
MATT: So does Jester produce the skull?

3649
02:30:16.066 --> 02:30:18.331
MARISHA: She's got it in her haversack.

3650
02:30:18.331 --> 02:30:19.331
TRAVIS: Yes.
MATT: Okay.

3651
02:30:21.243 --> 02:30:22.855
TALIESIN: Do we--

3652
02:30:22.855 --> 02:30:25.105
(laughter)

3653
02:30:25.996 --> 02:30:28.465
Do we want to do this?

3654
02:30:28.465 --> 02:30:30.847
SAM: You're going to talk to a skull here?

3655
02:30:30.847 --> 02:30:32.547
TALIESIN: Where would you prefer we talk to this?

3656
02:30:32.547 --> 02:30:33.628
SAM: Sure, let's do it.

3657
02:30:33.628 --> 02:30:35.240
MARISHA: How long does it take?

3658
02:30:35.240 --> 02:30:36.718
TALIESIN: Not long.

3659
02:30:36.718 --> 02:30:37.768
MATT: It's an action.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3660
02:30:37.768 --> 02:30:39.318
Could just have it--

3661
02:30:41.342 --> 02:30:44.700
Although, we-- do we have five questions

3662
02:30:44.700 --> 02:30:47.992
for this guy or person?

3663
02:30:51.290 --> 02:30:52.123
ASHLEY: What is this place?
LIAM: Definitely

3664
02:30:52.123 --> 02:30:52.998
what happened to you?

3665
02:30:52.998 --> 02:30:55.059
TRAVIS: What the fuck happened?

3666
02:30:58.621 --> 02:31:01.242
LIAM: What can they tell us of this place?

3667
02:31:01.242 --> 02:31:03.344
What do they know of this place?

3668
02:31:03.344 --> 02:31:04.889
ASHLEY: What do they know of the Angel of Irons?

3669
02:31:04.889 --> 02:31:06.379
LIAM: Yeah. That's three.

3670
02:31:06.379 --> 02:31:10.170
MARISHA: Do they know of who currently has control

3671
02:31:10.170 --> 02:31:13.227
over this chasm?

3672
02:31:13.227 --> 02:31:15.358
LIAM: By the look of that skull, it's been dead for a very,

3673
02:31:15.358 --> 02:31:18.796
very long time or does it look-- or is it fresh?

3674
02:31:18.796 --> 02:31:21.020
MATT: It seems to have been dead for quite some time.

3675
02:31:21.020 --> 02:31:22.661
TRAVIS: What are the weaknesses of the thing

3676
02:31:22.661 --> 02:31:24.331
that killed you?

3677
02:31:24.331 --> 02:31:26.524
TALIESIN: We'll see where the conversation progresses.

3678
02:31:26.524 --> 02:31:30.087
SAM: Do they know who took my flask?

3679
02:31:30.087 --> 02:31:32.280
TRAVIS: Nott, I think this thing's been dead a while.

3680
02:31:32.280 --> 02:31:33.813
LIAM: Yeah, anything happened recently

3681
02:31:33.813 --> 02:31:35.779
is pointless to ask it.

3682
02:31:37.889 --> 02:31:40.536
SAM: I'll leave that to you to include or not.

3683
02:31:40.536 --> 02:31:41.778
It's up to you.

3684
02:31:47.388 --> 02:31:48.822
TALIESIN: Sit down.

3685
02:31:50.129 --> 02:31:51.245
Okay, let's do this.

3686
02:31:51.245 --> 02:31:54.085
I might want you nearby just to--

3687
02:31:54.085 --> 02:31:55.115
ASHLEY: Yes, of course.

3688
02:31:55.115 --> 02:31:56.515
TALIESIN: All right.

3689
02:31:56.515 --> 02:31:58.265
ASHLEY: I'll stay with you.

3690
02:32:00.002 --> 02:32:03.118
MATT: So as you cast the spell on the dark, frozen floor,

3691
02:32:03.118 --> 02:32:05.222
you can see some of the cracks in the stone.

3692
02:32:05.222 --> 02:32:07.238
You watch as tiny green vines

3693
02:32:07.238 --> 02:32:10.049
begin to swirl up and fill the inside of the skull,

3694
02:32:10.049 --> 02:32:12.243
like a pillow lifting it forward a bit.

3695
02:32:12.243 --> 02:32:14.454
As the vines reach, they seem to tether themselves

3696
02:32:14.454 --> 02:32:18.270
around the jaw to form like a

3697
02:32:18.270 --> 02:32:20.342
makeshift muscle

3698
02:32:20.342 --> 02:32:22.324
that holds it in place and for that moment

3699
02:32:22.324 --> 02:32:26.544
the Wildmother is allowing some semblance of mobility

3700
02:32:26.544 --> 02:32:29.057
and life to this otherwise empty skull.

3701
02:32:29.057 --> 02:32:29.890
ASHLEY: So cool.

3702
02:32:35.037 --> 02:32:36.954
TALIESIN: What happened to you?

3703
02:32:39.216 --> 02:32:43.757
MATT: The jaw opens a bit and as the air escapes, it says,

3704
02:32:43.757 --> 02:32:48.757
"I was slain by those I was charged to contain,

3705
02:32:49.161 --> 02:32:51.303
"but succeeded."

3706
02:32:54.380 --> 02:32:57.474
TALIESIN: Who were you charged to contain?

3707
02:32:57.474 --> 02:32:59.141
MATT: "The Laughing Hand.

3708
02:33:00.111 --> 02:33:05.111
"Timeless in seeking torment of all, the undying chosen."

3709
02:33:07.740 --> 02:33:09.205
TRAVIS: What the fuck!

3710
02:33:09.205 --> 02:33:11.177
SAM: What were those words that he just said? The Laughing--

3711
02:33:11.177 --> 02:33:12.737
LIAM: The Laughing Hand.

3712
02:33:12.737 --> 02:33:14.129
MARISHA: The undying chosen.

3713
02:33:14.129 --> 02:33:16.400
And there was something in between those.

3714
02:33:16.400 --> 02:33:18.666
MATT: Timeless in seeking the torment of all.

3715
02:33:18.666 --> 02:33:20.179
MARISHA: The timeless in--

3716
02:33:20.179 --> 02:33:22.187
MATT: Timeless in seeking the torment of all.

3717
02:33:22.187 --> 02:33:24.270
MARISHA: The timeless in seeking--

3718
02:33:24.270 --> 02:33:26.020
TRAVIS: The torment of all.

3719
02:33:27.854 --> 02:33:30.733
LIAM: That's almost as long as Percy's name.

3720
02:33:30.733 --> 02:33:32.197
TALIESIN: Almost.

3721
02:33:32.197 --> 02:33:35.223
SAM: The King's instrument was deathless, right?

3722
02:33:35.223 --> 02:33:38.306
So the undying chosen is that person.

3723
02:33:46.422 --> 02:33:51.329
TALIESIN: What powers should we call upon to

3724
02:33:51.329 --> 02:33:55.504
aid and assist in the defeating of that darkness?

3725
02:33:57.643 --> 02:34:01.843
MATT: "The darkness you speak of cannot be defeated,

3726
02:34:01.843 --> 02:34:04.159
only sealed.

3727
02:34:05.140 --> 02:34:07.470
"This was his tomb."

3728
02:34:07.470 --> 02:34:09.445
SAM: <i>Was</i> his tomb.

3729
02:34:13.632 --> 02:34:14.465
TALIESIN: Huh.

3730
02:34:16.602 --> 02:34:20.769
Why would the forces of evil return to this place?

3731
02:34:23.407 --> 02:34:25.058
MATT: It can only speak on what it understands.

3732
02:34:25.058 --> 02:34:26.665
TALIESIN: All right, that's fair.

3733
02:34:26.665 --> 02:34:28.006
MATT: It only has its perspective on things.

3734
02:34:28.006 --> 02:34:29.565
So you have to ask it questions

3735
02:34:29.565 --> 02:34:32.482
that it would know or could answer.

3736
02:34:33.943 --> 02:34:35.986
TALIESIN: The Angel of Irons?

3737
02:34:35.986 --> 02:34:38.546
ASHLEY: Maybe that's who he's talking about.

3738
02:34:38.546 --> 02:34:40.879
TALIESIN: Who is the Angel of Irons?

3739
02:34:41.911 --> 02:34:43.747
MATT: "I do not know."

3740
02:34:43.747 --> 02:34:45.914
ASHLEY: So that's something new.

3741
02:34:49.321 --> 02:34:50.534
MATT: That's your fourth question.

3742
02:34:50.534 --> 02:34:52.617
TALIESIN: I know, I have one more.

3743
02:34:55.817 --> 02:34:58.464
SAM: How are you feeling?

3744
02:34:58.464 --> 02:35:00.755
MARISHA: Are the Yankees still in the World Series?

3745
02:35:03.405 --> 02:35:06.363
TALIESIN: How do we protect ourselves from the

3746
02:35:06.363 --> 02:35:09.246
chamber of mirrors?

3747
02:35:14.037 --> 02:35:16.050
MATT: "Don't continue."

3748
02:35:16.050 --> 02:35:17.946
SAM: Oh boy.
TALIESIN: Touché.

3749
02:35:17.946 --> 02:35:19.113
TRAVIS: Fuck.
MARISHA: Yeah.

3750
02:35:20.716 --> 02:35:22.822
MATT: The vines wither away and fall,

3751
02:35:22.822 --> 02:35:25.825
the skull jaw snaps open.

3752
02:35:25.825 --> 02:35:27.683
LIAM: It said that it fell trying to

3753
02:35:27.683 --> 02:35:30.551
contain the thing here and succeeded?

3754
02:35:30.551 --> 02:35:31.619
MATT: Mm-hm.

3755
02:35:31.619 --> 02:35:35.156
LIAM: So died, but succeeded, at least when it was here.

3756
02:35:35.156 --> 02:35:36.691
TRAVIS: In containing it.

3757
02:35:36.691 --> 02:35:39.516
SAM: Looking around the room, does it look like

3758
02:35:39.516 --> 02:35:43.684
at some point, this room was completely sealed?

3759
02:35:43.684 --> 02:35:46.469
Like all mirrors?

3760
02:35:46.469 --> 02:35:49.230
Then the mirrors near the door broke

3761
02:35:49.230 --> 02:35:50.634
or something like that?

3762
02:35:50.634 --> 02:35:52.217
MATT: From where you're standing, it just opens up

3763
02:35:52.217 --> 02:35:53.108
into the room,

3764
02:35:53.108 --> 02:35:56.358
you don't see any signs of a breached entryway or--

3765
02:35:56.358 --> 02:35:58.452
it just gradually turns into this room.

3766
02:35:58.452 --> 02:35:59.577
MARISHA: Let's move in a little bit.

3767
02:35:59.577 --> 02:36:01.864
LIAM: It moves forward and then branches?

3768
02:36:01.864 --> 02:36:03.280
MATT: It branches a bit to the right,

3769
02:36:03.280 --> 02:36:05.094
then branches to the left.

3770
02:36:05.094 --> 02:36:06.051
MARISHA: I move in.

3771
02:36:06.051 --> 02:36:08.109
MATT: You move in? Okay, as you move in towards the center,

3772
02:36:08.109 --> 02:36:09.411
you can see there are mirrors.

3773
02:36:09.411 --> 02:36:10.267
There are portions of the walls

3774
02:36:10.267 --> 02:36:11.932
that have no reflective surface on them,

3775
02:36:11.932 --> 02:36:12.992
but there are areas that are,

3776
02:36:12.992 --> 02:36:15.771
and they're scattered around different angles.

3777
02:36:15.771 --> 02:36:17.825
There's a tunnel that curves around this way,

3778
02:36:17.825 --> 02:36:20.033
that curves that way and opens up into a further hallway

3779
02:36:20.033 --> 02:36:22.333
that turns left this way and then breaches around.

3780
02:36:22.333 --> 02:36:25.658
There's a whole series of scattered tunnels

3781
02:36:25.658 --> 02:36:28.203
that all move and weave. And then across the way

3782
02:36:28.203 --> 02:36:30.964
you can see, with the light that you have up there,

3783
02:36:30.964 --> 02:36:33.281
that gives off the dim light a bit,

3784
02:36:33.281 --> 02:36:34.778
you can see another reflection

3785
02:36:34.778 --> 02:36:37.865
across the far wall of Caduceus' light.

3786
02:36:37.865 --> 02:36:40.182
LIAM: May I-- like I'm Jennifer Connelly

3787
02:36:40.182 --> 02:36:42.529
in that long passage at the beginning of Labyrinth--

3788
02:36:42.529 --> 02:36:44.945
try to see if there's any secret doorways,

3789
02:36:44.945 --> 02:36:49.712
or optical illusions, or any passages that are

3790
02:36:49.712 --> 02:36:50.837
hidden?

3791
02:36:50.837 --> 02:36:52.545
MATT: Okay, so you're going to go like along the walls

3792
02:36:52.545 --> 02:36:54.812
and try to feel for it or just glancing around?

3793
02:36:54.812 --> 02:36:56.652
LIAM: I'm going to look, I'm not going to touch.

3794
02:36:56.652 --> 02:36:59.031
MATT: Perception check.
LIAM: Yep.

3795
02:36:59.031 --> 02:37:01.481
MATT: Investigation would be going across and

3796
02:37:01.481 --> 02:37:03.239
checking around.

3797
02:37:04.515 --> 02:37:06.758
LIAM: Yeah, perception.

3798
02:37:06.758 --> 02:37:07.591
Good.

3799
02:37:09.207 --> 02:37:10.651
22.

3800
02:37:10.651 --> 02:37:11.985
MATT: 22, okay.

3801
02:37:13.194 --> 02:37:15.654
Looking about, you don't see any

3802
02:37:15.654 --> 02:37:18.370
small secret holes or doorways,

3803
02:37:18.370 --> 02:37:20.820
but as you glance across the opposite end,

3804
02:37:20.820 --> 02:37:24.309
at the very peripheral of the light that Caduceus has up,

3805
02:37:24.309 --> 02:37:26.752
you can see the wall texture and color changes

3806
02:37:26.752 --> 02:37:31.752
from that dull gray rock to a bright blue-white

3807
02:37:31.843 --> 02:37:36.469
like a deeply frosted ice or quartz.

3808
02:37:36.469 --> 02:37:37.302
TRAVIS: Glacier?

3809
02:37:37.302 --> 02:37:39.293
MATT: Almost like a glacier.

3810
02:37:41.454 --> 02:37:43.537
It's about 60 or so feet.

3811
02:37:44.666 --> 02:37:47.687
LIAM: I'm going to reach for my transmuter stone

3812
02:37:47.687 --> 02:37:50.086
and burn some transmutation magic in it,

3813
02:37:50.086 --> 02:37:51.674
I have one spell prepared,

3814
02:37:51.674 --> 02:37:53.568
and change its property,

3815
02:37:53.568 --> 02:37:57.340
which is currently helping with the saves,

3816
02:37:57.340 --> 02:38:00.198
to making me resistant to cold damage.

3817
02:38:00.198 --> 02:38:01.048
MATT: You got it.

3818
02:38:01.048 --> 02:38:05.086
TRAVIS: Can we look on the floor for recent tracks?

3819
02:38:05.086 --> 02:38:05.919
MATT: Sure.

3820
02:38:05.919 --> 02:38:06.991
Go ahead and make a--

3821
02:38:06.991 --> 02:38:11.057
this will be a survival for me. Survival check.

3822
02:38:11.057 --> 02:38:14.601
TRAVIS: (as Jester) Jester was definitely the one asking.

3823
02:38:14.601 --> 02:38:16.559
15.
MATT: Okay.

3824
02:38:16.559 --> 02:38:17.392
15.

3825
02:38:18.740 --> 02:38:23.332
Looking around a bit, Jester does see some footprints

3826
02:38:23.332 --> 02:38:26.054
that are fresh in the dust on the ground

3827
02:38:26.054 --> 02:38:28.912
and they move through.

3828
02:38:28.912 --> 02:38:31.832
They wind a bit through some of these tunnels,

3829
02:38:31.832 --> 02:38:33.062
like it's just looking around,

3830
02:38:33.062 --> 02:38:35.880
and head towards that glacier-type coloration.

3831
02:38:35.880 --> 02:38:38.340
TRAVIS: Singular or looks like multiple sets of?

3832
02:38:38.340 --> 02:38:40.348
MATT: Singular.

3833
02:38:40.348 --> 02:38:41.181
LIAM: ♪ One ♪

3834
02:38:42.331 --> 02:38:43.855
♪ Singular sensation ♪

3835
02:38:43.855 --> 02:38:46.976
TALIESIN: I feel like--
ASHLEY: ♪ Every right step she takes ♪

3836
02:38:46.976 --> 02:38:48.226
TALIESIN: ♪ Do do do do do ♪

3837
02:38:49.366 --> 02:38:50.199
TRAVIS: One!

3838
02:38:50.199 --> 02:38:51.361
TALIESIN: I feel like

3839
02:38:51.361 --> 02:38:53.295
light might not be the best thing in here

3840
02:38:53.295 --> 02:38:58.120
and maybe-- why would you put a bunch of mirrors in a room?

3841
02:38:58.120 --> 02:39:01.268
TRAVIS: Unless you didn't want something to see itself?

3842
02:39:01.268 --> 02:39:04.438
TALIESIN: Feels tempting.
TRAVIS: Or you did?

3843
02:39:04.438 --> 02:39:06.655
Like a gaze that would be harmful to itself.

3844
02:39:06.655 --> 02:39:08.609
LIAM: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

3845
02:39:08.609 --> 02:39:09.717
To send something harmful

3846
02:39:09.717 --> 02:39:11.338
in many directions at once, perhaps.

3847
02:39:11.338 --> 02:39:12.171
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3848
02:39:14.004 --> 02:39:18.262
TALIESIN: Mind maybe sending

3849
02:39:18.262 --> 02:39:20.520
your parrot-- your friend down the--

3850
02:39:20.520 --> 02:39:21.353
LIAM: It's a cat.

3851
02:39:21.353 --> 02:39:23.417
Which direction?

3852
02:39:23.417 --> 02:39:25.727
TALIESIN: Into the room. See what happens.

3853
02:39:25.727 --> 02:39:28.271
MARISHA: What's across from the glacier thing,

3854
02:39:28.271 --> 02:39:31.199
like directly across from it?

3855
02:39:31.199 --> 02:39:33.207
MATT: Some of the hallway a bit,

3856
02:39:33.207 --> 02:39:34.567
a little tunnel that goes off to the side.

3857
02:39:34.567 --> 02:39:35.769
Nothing else icy.

3858
02:39:35.769 --> 02:39:38.769
More just walls and mirrors.

3859
02:39:39.965 --> 02:39:42.230
LIAM: I apparate Frumpkin.

3860
02:39:42.230 --> 02:39:43.426
MATT: Okay.

3861
02:39:43.426 --> 02:39:45.473
LIAM: Set him on the ground.

3862
02:39:45.473 --> 02:39:48.220
Okay, you're going to walk, don't fly, walk

3863
02:39:48.220 --> 02:39:51.093
slowly and go see what's in there, all right?

3864
02:39:51.093 --> 02:39:52.268
TRAVIS: If there was somebody invisible

3865
02:39:52.268 --> 02:39:53.493
in this room with us,

3866
02:39:53.493 --> 02:39:55.290
how would we find them?

3867
02:39:55.290 --> 02:39:56.886
Feeling around?

3868
02:39:56.886 --> 02:39:59.321
MARISHA: If we had dust.

3869
02:39:59.321 --> 02:40:00.528
Glitter.

3870
02:40:00.528 --> 02:40:01.952
MATT: Frumpkin heads over and comes up.

3871
02:40:01.952 --> 02:40:04.006
MARISHA: Something to throw in their faces.

3872
02:40:04.006 --> 02:40:06.625
MATT: So from what Frumpkin can see now,

3873
02:40:06.625 --> 02:40:07.827
going around the edge

3874
02:40:07.827 --> 02:40:11.847
to the opposite side of this chamber, to the left,

3875
02:40:11.847 --> 02:40:15.213
you can see the beginnings of another hallway,

3876
02:40:15.213 --> 02:40:18.613
a rectangular archway,

3877
02:40:18.613 --> 02:40:21.579
but it's blocked by a crystal barrier

3878
02:40:21.579 --> 02:40:23.415
embedded within a brass frame.

3879
02:40:23.415 --> 02:40:25.378
A thick brass frame around the edges of it,

3880
02:40:25.378 --> 02:40:27.357
and that's where you can see the

3881
02:40:27.357 --> 02:40:31.190
glacier-like ice crystal, quartz-like barrier.

3882
02:40:32.710 --> 02:40:34.176
LIAM: He sees that because he's closer

3883
02:40:34.176 --> 02:40:35.325
or because he's looking around?

3884
02:40:35.325 --> 02:40:36.734
MATT: Because he's moved closer

3885
02:40:36.734 --> 02:40:38.104
and moved around the wall

3886
02:40:38.104 --> 02:40:39.561
a little bit from where you guys were.

3887
02:40:39.561 --> 02:40:41.616
You just saw that coloration change a little bit

3888
02:40:41.616 --> 02:40:44.005
right before the wall blocks it.

3889
02:40:44.005 --> 02:40:46.809
So he moved around and got a little close and can see it.

3890
02:40:46.809 --> 02:40:48.083
The brass frame moves around

3891
02:40:48.083 --> 02:40:50.862
and you can see at the top of the brass frame in the center,

3892
02:40:50.862 --> 02:40:55.435
there's a-- the brass metal bows a bit

3893
02:40:55.435 --> 02:40:58.933
in a somewhat oblong egg-like shape

3894
02:40:58.933 --> 02:41:03.580
and then on the sides of it, there's two on each side.

3895
02:41:03.580 --> 02:41:04.504
LIAM: Two--?

3896
02:41:04.504 --> 02:41:05.562
MATT: Two more of these like--

3897
02:41:05.562 --> 02:41:07.925
it's almost like vases.

3898
02:41:07.925 --> 02:41:09.216
The actual-- the brass frame,

3899
02:41:09.216 --> 02:41:13.297
bows out into this smooth egg vase-like shape

3900
02:41:13.297 --> 02:41:15.050
and there's two of them on that side,

3901
02:41:15.050 --> 02:41:16.260
two of them on this side,

3902
02:41:16.260 --> 02:41:17.765
and then that one in the center at the top.

3903
02:41:17.765 --> 02:41:20.256
It's about eight or nine feet high.

3904
02:41:20.256 --> 02:41:21.197
LIAM: Something crafted?

3905
02:41:21.197 --> 02:41:22.521
MATT: This is crafted.
LIAM: Yeah.

3906
02:41:22.521 --> 02:41:23.996
MATT: Intentionally.
LIAM: Okay.

3907
02:41:25.810 --> 02:41:30.143
There is a very strange barrier around the corner.

3908
02:41:32.824 --> 02:41:36.182
I would like to take a look at it.

3909
02:41:37.171 --> 02:41:40.404
TRAVIS: (as Jester) Are there also footprints that go

3910
02:41:40.404 --> 02:41:42.887
in that direction?

3911
02:41:44.968 --> 02:41:45.801
LIAM: Yeah.

3912
02:41:46.888 --> 02:41:47.995
Yeah.
MARISHA: What's above us?

3913
02:41:47.995 --> 02:41:49.304
Anything?

3914
02:41:50.162 --> 02:41:53.991
MATT: It's about 12 to 15 feet of ceiling.

3915
02:41:53.991 --> 02:41:56.741
This isn't as smoothly carved, it's been hewn out,

3916
02:41:56.741 --> 02:41:59.457
like carved out, but it's not super well-refined,

3917
02:41:59.457 --> 02:42:00.756
flat, smooth top.

3918
02:42:00.756 --> 02:42:02.773
It's a little uneven.

3919
02:42:02.773 --> 02:42:04.181
TRAVIS: Can I walk up to the nearest mirror

3920
02:42:04.181 --> 02:42:06.061
and put my hand on it?

3921
02:42:06.061 --> 02:42:07.581
MATT: Sure.

3922
02:42:07.581 --> 02:42:08.706
It's a mirror.

3923
02:42:08.706 --> 02:42:10.336
TRAVIS: The vibration still--?

3924
02:42:10.336 --> 02:42:12.950
MATT: Make a perception check.

3925
02:42:14.504 --> 02:42:15.736
TRAVIS: 16.

3926
02:42:15.736 --> 02:42:17.403
MATT: 16, okay.

3927
02:42:18.351 --> 02:42:22.153
You put your hand against the mirror, and

3928
02:42:22.153 --> 02:42:25.075
there's no vibration, nothing.

3929
02:42:25.075 --> 02:42:27.272
You turn and look at the rest of your friends

3930
02:42:27.272 --> 02:42:29.075
and out of the corner of your eye (whoosh)

3931
02:42:29.075 --> 02:42:30.317
something moves.

3932
02:42:30.317 --> 02:42:32.063
SAM: What?

3933
02:42:32.063 --> 02:42:35.452
TRAVIS: I summon the falchion and say: Something moved!

3934
02:42:35.452 --> 02:42:36.490
MATT: You look back.

3935
02:42:36.490 --> 02:42:37.323
ASHLEY: Fjord?

3936
02:42:39.156 --> 02:42:41.879
TRAVIS: Do I see anything?
MATT: See nothing.

3937
02:42:41.879 --> 02:42:43.637
TRAVIS: Something's in here with us.

3938
02:42:43.637 --> 02:42:46.054
I saw movement, it wasn't us.

3939
02:42:46.999 --> 02:42:47.916
ASHLEY: I think--

3940
02:42:49.849 --> 02:42:52.602
TRAVIS: I swear I saw something.

3941
02:42:52.602 --> 02:42:55.652
I look back at the mirror. Do I see anything in the mirror?

3942
02:42:55.652 --> 02:42:56.732
MATT: No.

3943
02:42:56.732 --> 02:42:58.260
LIAM: Okay, okay.

3944
02:42:58.260 --> 02:43:01.043
TRAVIS: I swear I saw movement.

3945
02:43:01.043 --> 02:43:02.653
ASHLEY: We don't see anything in the mirror?

3946
02:43:02.653 --> 02:43:06.181
MARISHA: Try and keep an eye towards the mirrors, I think?

3947
02:43:06.181 --> 02:43:07.651
LIAM: Yeah, back to back a little bit.

3948
02:43:07.651 --> 02:43:08.879
MARISHA: Yeah, back to back.

3949
02:43:08.879 --> 02:43:12.363
LIAM: And-- oh boy.
MARISHA: So--

3950
02:43:14.225 --> 02:43:15.953
Yasha.
ASHLEY: Yeah?

3951
02:43:15.953 --> 02:43:17.494
MARISHA: It was "build every bridge."

3952
02:43:17.494 --> 02:43:18.952
ASHLEY: Yeah, "build every bridge."

3953
02:43:18.952 --> 02:43:20.315
MARISHA and ASHLEY: "Become every nightmare."

3954
02:43:20.315 --> 02:43:23.642
ASHLEY: And "feast on every heart."

3955
02:43:23.642 --> 02:43:25.065
MARISHA: What was the last one?

3956
02:43:25.065 --> 02:43:27.564
ASHLEY: Feast on every heart, so maybe we already--

3957
02:43:27.564 --> 02:43:28.916
TALIESIN: We did that one.
ASHLEY: -- did that?

3958
02:43:28.916 --> 02:43:31.840
MARISHA: We did the hearts, we came across the bridge.

3959
02:43:31.840 --> 02:43:33.056
TALIESIN: Welcome to the nightmare?

3960
02:43:33.056 --> 02:43:34.207
MARISHA: This whole goddamn thing

3961
02:43:34.207 --> 02:43:36.782
feels like a nightmare, but yeah.

3962
02:43:40.313 --> 02:43:41.146
LIAM: Nott.

3963
02:43:42.298 --> 02:43:43.131
SAM: Yes?

3964
02:43:43.131 --> 02:43:44.624
LIAM: Will you come over in this direction, please?

3965
02:43:44.624 --> 02:43:48.390
There is a strange barrier or wall or something

3966
02:43:48.390 --> 02:43:51.509
and I want us to inspect it together.

3967
02:43:51.509 --> 02:43:56.342
You for physical danger and I will try to figure out if--

3968
02:43:58.575 --> 02:44:02.134
Caduceus, actually, are you able to

3969
02:44:02.134 --> 02:44:05.776
sense magic quickly right now?

3970
02:44:06.663 --> 02:44:07.996
TALIESIN: No, no I've--

3971
02:44:11.061 --> 02:44:12.635
A little empty on that right now.

3972
02:44:12.635 --> 02:44:14.650
LIAM: All right, Nott, please come.

3973
02:44:14.650 --> 02:44:16.836
SAM: Okay.

3974
02:44:16.836 --> 02:44:17.669
Sure.

3975
02:44:19.078 --> 02:44:22.028
You want me to just check for traps and stuff?

3976
02:44:22.028 --> 02:44:25.267
LIAM: Yep, <i>ja</i>, be careful, though.

3977
02:44:25.267 --> 02:44:27.672
SAM: Okay. I will check.

3978
02:44:27.672 --> 02:44:29.019
MATT: You both have approached the barrier?

3979
02:44:29.019 --> 02:44:30.291
SAM: It's a wall?

3980
02:44:30.291 --> 02:44:33.404
MATT: It's like an eight-foot high door,

3981
02:44:33.404 --> 02:44:37.806
or like a barrier, that is about say nine feet wide.

3982
02:44:37.806 --> 02:44:40.084
So it's actually wider than it is tall,

3983
02:44:40.084 --> 02:44:43.972
with that brass outside framing of it,

3984
02:44:43.972 --> 02:44:48.658
with those strange, smooth bulbous shapes

3985
02:44:48.658 --> 02:44:52.361
that come out of the brass framing and the one on top.

3986
02:44:52.361 --> 02:44:53.887
ASHLEY: You're both in there together?

3987
02:44:53.887 --> 02:44:56.060
TALIESIN: I think we're staying--
TRAVIS: Back to back.

3988
02:44:56.060 --> 02:44:56.893
TALIESIN: Huddle.

3989
02:44:56.893 --> 02:44:58.929
MATT: Okay, so you're all moving carefully around,

3990
02:44:58.929 --> 02:45:00.420
back to back, shifting through.

3991
02:45:00.420 --> 02:45:02.732
TALIESIN: Just-- I'm like trying to keep

3992
02:45:02.732 --> 02:45:04.668
as much periphery for anything.

3993
02:45:04.668 --> 02:45:06.716
MATT: All right, everyone make a perception check.

3994
02:45:06.716 --> 02:45:07.799
MARISHA: Did you say there were pieces of glass

3995
02:45:07.799 --> 02:45:08.640
on the ground?

3996
02:45:08.640 --> 02:45:10.073
MATT: A couple small shards,

3997
02:45:10.073 --> 02:45:11.364
broken off edges and corners.

3998
02:45:11.364 --> 02:45:13.667
MARISHA: I'll pick up one when we're moving through.

3999
02:45:13.667 --> 02:45:17.383
LIAM: Can I focus then and try to figure out if

4000
02:45:17.383 --> 02:45:20.355
there's any handle, clasp, any writing,

4001
02:45:20.355 --> 02:45:22.859
anything to this gate that would explain it?

4002
02:45:22.859 --> 02:45:23.692
MATT: Sure.

4003
02:45:24.812 --> 02:45:25.645
LIAM: Perception still?

4004
02:45:25.645 --> 02:45:27.128
MATT: Yes.
LIAM: Okay.

4005
02:45:30.784 --> 02:45:32.910
15 for me.
MARISHA: Eight.

4006
02:45:32.910 --> 02:45:34.608
TRAVIS: Seven, eight.

4007
02:45:34.608 --> 02:45:36.941
SAM: 15.
TALIESIN: 11.

4008
02:45:36.941 --> 02:45:39.447
ASHLEY: 18.
SAM: Ooh.

4009
02:45:39.447 --> 02:45:42.197
MATT: Okay, currently looking around,

4010
02:45:44.479 --> 02:45:47.601
you don't see anything beyond your reflections

4011
02:45:47.601 --> 02:45:50.035
in these walls and these mirrors.

4012
02:45:50.035 --> 02:45:53.266
You can see, you know, now that you've pointed it out,

4013
02:45:53.266 --> 02:45:54.818
you can see the footsteps

4014
02:45:54.818 --> 02:45:57.051
that maneuver through the different hallways,

4015
02:45:57.051 --> 02:46:00.195
the single pair, did a pass or two of the whole chamber

4016
02:46:00.195 --> 02:46:03.740
and then goes and leads up to that same barrier.

4017
02:46:03.740 --> 02:46:05.240
TRAVIS: The crystal barrier.

4018
02:46:06.155 --> 02:46:10.935
MATT: You guys are about five or so feet from that barrier.

4019
02:46:10.935 --> 02:46:12.208
There's just Caduceus' light,

4020
02:46:12.208 --> 02:46:13.940
the one source of light in this chamber.

4021
02:46:13.940 --> 02:46:17.083
TRAVIS: Any chance these mirrors
will be a detriment to us at one point?

4022
02:46:17.083 --> 02:46:18.746
Should we take them down?

4023
02:46:20.596 --> 02:46:23.857
It obviously didn't hurt the person that came before.

4024
02:46:23.857 --> 02:46:26.004
LIAM: Let's do that--

4025
02:46:26.004 --> 02:46:28.370
Let's try a couple of things first.

4026
02:46:28.370 --> 02:46:29.203
TRAVIS: Okay.

4027
02:46:29.203 --> 02:46:31.719
LIAM: I could have Frumpkin peck a bit at that

4028
02:46:31.719 --> 02:46:33.696
and see if anything happens.

4029
02:46:33.696 --> 02:46:34.971
TRAVIS: At the crystal?
LIAM: Yeah.

4030
02:46:34.971 --> 02:46:36.151
Maybe we could all back away a bit.

4031
02:46:36.151 --> 02:46:38.231
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's do that.

4032
02:46:38.231 --> 02:46:39.464
LIAM: Circle.

4033
02:46:39.464 --> 02:46:41.241
SAM: Was I going to check for traps?
LIAM: Yeah.

4034
02:46:41.241 --> 02:46:43.366
SAM: Okay. Check for traps.

4035
02:46:44.674 --> 02:46:45.541
20.

4036
02:46:45.541 --> 02:46:47.916
MATT: 20, no traps apparently.

4037
02:46:49.091 --> 02:46:51.511
SAM: No traps. Apparently.

4038
02:46:51.511 --> 02:46:53.405
LIAM: Okay, let's get 20 or 30 back,

4039
02:46:53.405 --> 02:46:57.972
let's get around the corner and have Frumpkin go.

4040
02:46:57.972 --> 02:46:58.985
MATT: There's around the corner--

4041
02:46:58.985 --> 02:47:00.881
like if you're facing the barrier,

4042
02:47:00.881 --> 02:47:02.343
there's around the corner to the right

4043
02:47:02.343 --> 02:47:05.096
or there's back and there's a small hallway to the left,

4044
02:47:05.096 --> 02:47:06.963
like a five, seven-foot wide hallway.

4045
02:47:06.963 --> 02:47:08.538
LIAM: So there's multiple passages

4046
02:47:08.538 --> 02:47:10.140
that we haven't figured out?
MATT: There's multiple hallways.

4047
02:47:10.140 --> 02:47:11.316
Correct.

4048
02:47:11.316 --> 02:47:12.819
You've only gone to this center,

4049
02:47:12.819 --> 02:47:14.208
main central hallway chamber,

4050
02:47:14.208 --> 02:47:16.357
but it branches off in many directions.

4051
02:47:16.357 --> 02:47:17.729
LIAM: Yeah, then I'll hold off on Frumpkin

4052
02:47:17.729 --> 02:47:19.406
fucking with that door.

4053
02:47:19.406 --> 02:47:20.889
Do you fuck with the door?

4054
02:47:20.889 --> 02:47:22.972
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Do you fuck with the door?

4055
02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:26.555
TRAVIS: No, I don't fuck with the door.

4056
02:47:26.555 --> 02:47:28.305
TALIESIN: Thank you for that.

4057
02:47:30.138 --> 02:47:32.214
Yeah, just keeping an eye out,

4058
02:47:32.214 --> 02:47:35.552
including in the mirrors, for anything discordant.

4059
02:47:35.552 --> 02:47:36.612
MATT: Okay.

4060
02:47:36.612 --> 02:47:38.082
You guys stand there and keep an eye out.

4061
02:47:38.082 --> 02:47:39.378
TALIESIN: We're going into that--

4062
02:47:39.378 --> 02:47:41.409
MARISHA: Moving in a new hallway.

4063
02:47:41.409 --> 02:47:44.324
LIAM: How about we go in, like,

4064
02:47:44.324 --> 02:47:45.697
with a little space between us, a line,

4065
02:47:45.697 --> 02:47:47.834
that way some people don't go off on their own

4066
02:47:47.834 --> 02:47:50.895
and get harmed, and everybody's got

4067
02:47:50.895 --> 02:47:53.387
somebody in sight at all times.

4068
02:47:53.387 --> 02:47:56.376
Nobody goes around a corner and is out of sight.

4069
02:47:56.376 --> 02:47:57.209
MARISHA: Okay.

4070
02:47:58.856 --> 02:47:59.689
LIAM: Okay.

4071
02:48:01.059 --> 02:48:03.392
TRAVIS: How are you feeling, Yasha?

4072
02:48:04.521 --> 02:48:07.774
ASHLEY: I mean, I feel probably as weird as we all do.

4073
02:48:07.774 --> 02:48:10.208
This place is creepy.

4074
02:48:11.322 --> 02:48:13.489
TRAVIS: You don't hear anything?

4075
02:48:15.588 --> 02:48:17.588
ASHLEY: I don't hear anything.

4076
02:48:23.309 --> 02:48:26.752
Did you hear something when you touched the mirror?

4077
02:48:26.752 --> 02:48:28.711
TRAVIS: No, I just saw something.

4078
02:48:28.711 --> 02:48:30.300
ASHLEY: You saw something after you touched the mirror

4079
02:48:30.300 --> 02:48:31.361
or in the mirror?

4080
02:48:31.361 --> 02:48:33.332
TRAVIS: Like a little, did I see it in the mirror

4081
02:48:33.332 --> 02:48:34.624
or out of the corner of my eye

4082
02:48:34.624 --> 02:48:36.723
in the space outside of the mirror?

4083
02:48:36.723 --> 02:48:39.111
MATT: It was either right next to you or in the mirror

4084
02:48:39.111 --> 02:48:40.920
or in the space over here as you were looking away,

4085
02:48:40.920 --> 02:48:41.916
you're not sure.

4086
02:48:41.916 --> 02:48:42.749
TRAVIS: It's hard to tell.

4087
02:48:42.749 --> 02:48:44.179
It was like as I was turning my head.

4088
02:48:44.179 --> 02:48:47.470
LIAM: Maybe it was just one of our reflections that you saw.

4089
02:48:47.470 --> 02:48:49.319
TALIESIN: I'm also going to just keep an eye out on

4090
02:48:49.319 --> 02:48:53.073
everybody else to see if anything's riding around on people.

4091
02:48:53.073 --> 02:48:54.033
MATT: Okay.

4092
02:48:54.033 --> 02:48:55.686
ASHLEY: Can I touch one of the mirrors

4093
02:48:55.686 --> 02:49:00.480
and see if I see anything in there?

4094
02:49:00.480 --> 02:49:01.313
MATT: Okay.

4095
02:49:01.313 --> 02:49:02.926
So you walk up to one of the mirrors

4096
02:49:02.926 --> 02:49:03.917
and put your hand to it?

4097
02:49:03.917 --> 02:49:05.694
ASHLEY: Just whichever's closest, yeah.

4098
02:49:05.694 --> 02:49:07.027
MATT: Okay, so you--

4099
02:49:08.023 --> 02:49:09.829
ASHLEY: You touched the-- hey, Fjord?

4100
02:49:09.829 --> 02:49:10.904
You touched the mirror?

4101
02:49:10.904 --> 02:49:13.079
TRAVIS: I did.
ASHLEY: And nothing happened?

4102
02:49:13.079 --> 02:49:17.929
MATT: You walk up to the mirror, put your hand to it.

4103
02:49:17.929 --> 02:49:20.621
Your reflection, it's warm to the touch.

4104
02:49:21.569 --> 02:49:22.437
TRAVIS: That's different.

4105
02:49:22.437 --> 02:49:23.937
MATT: The Yasha in the mirror looks back at you

4106
02:49:23.937 --> 02:49:26.586
and smiles and grabs you and pulls you into the mirror.

4107
02:49:26.586 --> 02:49:28.127
(screaming)

4108
02:49:28.127 --> 02:49:29.431
MARISHA: No!

4109
02:49:29.431 --> 02:49:30.619
MATT: I'll be right back!

4110
02:49:30.619 --> 02:49:32.669
TRAVIS: What?! What?!

4111
02:49:34.775 --> 02:49:35.889
SAM: Guys!

4112
02:49:35.889 --> 02:49:38.120
ASHLEY: Whoops!
SAM: But guys!

4113
02:49:38.120 --> 02:49:41.320
We're finally onto the Dwarven Forge camera!

4114
02:49:41.320 --> 02:49:43.718
ASHLEY: Oh no, what did I just do?!

4115
02:49:43.718 --> 02:49:46.992
SAM: This combat is powered by Dwarven Forge.

4116
02:49:46.992 --> 02:49:48.583
TALIESIN: This is so stressful.

4117
02:49:48.583 --> 02:49:49.967
SAM: Hellscape Kickstarter campaign--

4118
02:49:49.967 --> 02:49:52.089
(screaming)

4119
02:49:52.089 --> 02:49:53.355
SAM: That is amazing.

4120
02:49:53.355 --> 02:49:55.878
LIAM: Matthew Mercer with the fucking dungeon crawl!

4121
02:49:55.878 --> 02:49:58.506
SAM: It's full of all kinds of details

4122
02:49:58.506 --> 02:50:01.612
that you'll need to build your own personal hell.

4123
02:50:01.612 --> 02:50:03.615
The campaign ends July 1st,

4124
02:50:03.615 --> 02:50:07.698
support it at critrole.com/hellscape.

4125
02:50:09.098 --> 02:50:10.582
TRAVIS: What did--?

4126
02:50:11.760 --> 02:50:14.569
SAM: This is amazing.

4127
02:50:14.569 --> 02:50:15.679
MATT: This is fun.

4128
02:50:15.679 --> 02:50:16.914
TALIESIN: Fuck.

4129
02:50:16.914 --> 02:50:18.355
TRAVIS: It's the mirrors!

4130
02:50:18.355 --> 02:50:21.538
MARISHA: This is why he wanted to go to the craft store.

4131
02:50:23.065 --> 02:50:23.898
I see.

4132
02:50:23.898 --> 02:50:25.595
LIAM: Your house is a craft store.

4133
02:50:25.595 --> 02:50:27.315
MARISHA: My house is a craft store.

4134
02:50:27.315 --> 02:50:28.598
LIAM: You are the brute squad!

4135
02:50:28.598 --> 02:50:31.665
MARISHA: We have like 500 tiny eggs,

4136
02:50:31.665 --> 02:50:35.575
because he ordered them in bulk for last campaign.

4137
02:50:35.575 --> 02:50:37.585
So if anyone needs plastic eggs.

4138
02:50:37.585 --> 02:50:39.549
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

4139
02:50:39.549 --> 02:50:40.502
LIAM: Wow.

4140
02:50:40.502 --> 02:50:44.835
MATT: So Yasha, you get pulled through that space there

4141
02:50:46.079 --> 02:50:47.529
and are facing--

4142
02:50:48.737 --> 02:50:50.602
yourself.

4143
02:50:50.602 --> 02:50:52.399
So it has pulled you through.

4144
02:50:52.399 --> 02:50:53.823
SAM: This is the greatest.

4145
02:50:53.823 --> 02:50:55.319
MATT: I need you to roll initiative.

4146
02:50:55.319 --> 02:50:57.956
ASHLEY: Oh my god.
MARISHA: It's just you?

4147
02:50:57.956 --> 02:50:59.832
TRAVIS: Come on, girl!

4148
02:50:59.832 --> 02:51:01.099
Let's go!

4149
02:51:01.099 --> 02:51:01.932
ASHLEY: Oh no!

4150
02:51:03.008 --> 02:51:05.034
Oh, I have advantage!

4151
02:51:05.034 --> 02:51:07.060
Oh shit.

4152
02:51:07.060 --> 02:51:08.210
Eight.

4153
02:51:08.210 --> 02:51:09.851
MATT: Eight, okay.

4154
02:51:11.550 --> 02:51:13.059
TALIESIN: Is that with your normal advantage?

4155
02:51:13.059 --> 02:51:15.706
ASHLEY: Yeah, just normal, plus two.

4156
02:51:15.706 --> 02:51:16.706
TALIESIN: Fudge, ah!

4157
02:51:18.489 --> 02:51:20.022
ASHLEY: Do I-- does it look like I'm in--

4158
02:51:20.022 --> 02:51:22.184
okay, I don't know if I'm up first.

4159
02:51:22.184 --> 02:51:23.776
TALIESIN: There's just so much smoke.

4160
02:51:23.776 --> 02:51:26.484
TRAVIS: You're going to get fucking destroyed.

4161
02:51:27.509 --> 02:51:30.317
You don't want that thunder.
LIAM: Ooh, you're in trouble!

4162
02:51:34.350 --> 02:51:35.185
MATT: All right so.

4163
02:51:35.185 --> 02:51:36.900
ASHLEY: No, she doesn't!

4164
02:51:39.368 --> 02:51:41.021
LIAM: You don't know.
MARISHA: It's okay!

4165
02:51:41.021 --> 02:51:42.174
ASHLEY: I do know.

4166
02:51:42.174 --> 02:51:45.463
LIAM: She could be watching Twitch on the potty right now.

4167
02:51:45.463 --> 02:51:47.086
MATT: Yasha, you're going first.

4168
02:51:47.086 --> 02:51:48.836
ASHLEY: Oh, okay okay okay.

4169
02:51:51.063 --> 02:51:52.810
MATT: She's still holding your wrist, pulls you in,

4170
02:51:52.810 --> 02:51:55.336
the face is your face but a twisted grin,

4171
02:51:55.336 --> 02:51:58.221
holding your arm, the weapon still sheathed,

4172
02:51:58.221 --> 02:52:01.782
both of your swords sheathed on its back and yours.

4173
02:52:01.782 --> 02:52:03.128
What are you doing?

4174
02:52:03.128 --> 02:52:05.063
ASHLEY: I mean, I'm going to attack.

4175
02:52:05.063 --> 02:52:06.570
I'm going to rage!

4176
02:52:06.570 --> 02:52:09.463
SAM: Wait, is there another-- is there a second Yasha mini?

4177
02:52:09.463 --> 02:52:10.504
TRAVIS: Yes!

4178
02:52:10.504 --> 02:52:11.445
MATT: That's the one we had at the

4179
02:52:11.445 --> 02:52:12.293
beginning of the campaign.

4180
02:52:12.293 --> 02:52:13.126
SAM: Whoa!

4181
02:52:14.455 --> 02:52:18.466
MATT: So Yasha, which sword are you pulling?

4182
02:52:18.466 --> 02:52:19.482
LIAM: -- in Campaign one.

4183
02:52:19.482 --> 02:52:20.315
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

4184
02:52:21.201 --> 02:52:22.245
ASHLEY: Magician's Judge.

4185
02:52:22.245 --> 02:52:24.352
MATT: All right, you pull Magician's Judge out.

4186
02:52:24.352 --> 02:52:26.174
Go ahead and make your attacks.

4187
02:52:26.174 --> 02:52:27.751
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.

4188
02:52:27.751 --> 02:52:29.033
TRAVIS: Holy fuck.

4189
02:52:29.033 --> 02:52:30.703
MATT: You watch a low mist

4190
02:52:30.703 --> 02:52:33.450
has encompassed most of the floor of this strange area

4191
02:52:33.450 --> 02:52:36.352
and this is a reverse of the chamber that you're in.

4192
02:52:36.352 --> 02:52:40.185
It is a backwards version of the room where you had entered.

4193
02:52:40.185 --> 02:52:41.435
ASHLEY: 17.

4194
02:52:41.435 --> 02:52:44.346
MATT: 17, that hits, go ahead and roll damage.

4195
02:52:44.346 --> 02:52:46.211
TALIESIN: I'm going to be that person, too, goddamn it.

4196
02:52:46.211 --> 02:52:47.659
It's too pretty.

4197
02:52:47.659 --> 02:52:48.794
MARISHA: It really is.

4198
02:52:48.794 --> 02:52:51.331
SAM: Ooh, if Jester goes in there, she can Invoke Duplicity

4199
02:52:51.331 --> 02:52:54.063
and then there'll be four of her!

4200
02:52:54.063 --> 02:52:55.863
TALIESIN: As Matt goes, "Oh no."

4201
02:52:57.259 --> 02:52:58.409
ASHLEY: Okay.

4202
02:53:00.824 --> 02:53:02.075
Okay.

4203
02:53:02.075 --> 02:53:02.908
Seven plus--

4204
02:53:04.804 --> 02:53:06.887
MARISHA: There it goes, there it goes.

4205
02:53:08.283 --> 02:53:09.457
LIAM: Break their bones.

4206
02:53:09.457 --> 02:53:10.432
ASHLEY: I'm going to roll again,

4207
02:53:10.432 --> 02:53:11.670
see if Savage Attacker is better.

4208
02:53:11.670 --> 02:53:12.720
TRAVIS: Laura says she's going to kill you.

4209
02:53:12.720 --> 02:53:13.728
ASHLEY: No, that's not better.

4210
02:53:13.728 --> 02:53:18.120
Okay, 17 points of damage.

4211
02:53:18.120 --> 02:53:19.700
MATT: Nice!

4212
02:53:19.700 --> 02:53:21.660
Okay, that's your first attack, roll your second attack.

4213
02:53:21.660 --> 02:53:23.827
TALIESIN: Nope, not touching that.

4214
02:53:25.169 --> 02:53:27.052
I know where my bread is buttered.

4215
02:53:27.052 --> 02:53:28.100
ASHLEY: Ugh!

4216
02:53:28.100 --> 02:53:30.208
I'm rolling that again.

4217
02:53:30.208 --> 02:53:32.825
Yeah, I'm going to take that one.

4218
02:53:32.825 --> 02:53:33.842
11 points of damage.

4219
02:53:33.842 --> 02:53:35.086
MATT: 11 points of damage.

4220
02:53:35.086 --> 02:53:37.539
You arc through both slashes.

4221
02:53:37.539 --> 02:53:41.035
The Yasha leaps forwards towards you

4222
02:53:41.035 --> 02:53:43.636
immediately after the attack, unless you want to move,

4223
02:53:43.636 --> 02:53:45.332
are you moving with your turn or are you going to stay?

4224
02:53:45.332 --> 02:53:47.968
ASHLEY: I'm going to try to back up against the mirror

4225
02:53:47.968 --> 02:53:49.170
and see if I can get back through.

4226
02:53:49.170 --> 02:53:50.998
MATT: Okay.

4227
02:53:50.998 --> 02:53:53.885
(thud) The mirror stops you.

4228
02:53:53.885 --> 02:53:55.746
TRAVIS: Better grab that bitch.

4229
02:53:55.746 --> 02:53:57.281
ASHLEY: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Passport.

4230
02:53:57.281 --> 02:53:59.553
MATT: It does get an attack of opportunity against you.

4231
02:53:59.553 --> 02:54:02.886
It's going to go ahead and make a bite attack.

4232
02:54:02.886 --> 02:54:04.625
LIAM: Bite attack?

4233
02:54:04.625 --> 02:54:05.641
This is a nightmare.

4234
02:54:05.641 --> 02:54:06.884
MATT: That is a 17 to hit?

4235
02:54:08.698 --> 02:54:11.048
ASHLEY: 17 to hit? That hits.

4236
02:54:11.048 --> 02:54:13.832
SAM: Oh man, look at all that fucking smoke.

4237
02:54:13.832 --> 02:54:15.419
MATT: You take--

4238
02:54:15.419 --> 02:54:16.778
MARISHA: Double or nothing.

4239
02:54:16.778 --> 02:54:17.977
LIAM: ♪ Double double your-- ♪

4240
02:54:17.977 --> 02:54:21.362
MATT: Eight points of piercing damage, reduced to four.

4241
02:54:21.362 --> 02:54:24.326
And nine points of acid damage.

4242
02:54:24.326 --> 02:54:26.078
As you run away, the Yasha's jaw

4243
02:54:26.078 --> 02:54:27.495
opens up unnaturally

4244
02:54:27.495 --> 02:54:31.615
and sinks into your shoulder and as you tear away,

4245
02:54:31.615 --> 02:54:35.221
where the bite wound was-- (sizzling)

4246
02:54:35.221 --> 02:54:38.948
the wound burns and sizzles.

4247
02:54:38.948 --> 02:54:40.556
ASHLEY: I scream out in rage,

4248
02:54:40.556 --> 02:54:42.661
hoping that maybe they can hear.

4249
02:54:42.661 --> 02:54:45.770
Just at the top of my lungs, I just scream.

4250
02:54:45.770 --> 02:54:48.297
(yells)
LIAM: ♪ (Beginning of "Immigrant Song")

4251
02:54:48.297 --> 02:54:51.022
MATT: All right, it echoes through the chamber.

4252
02:54:51.022 --> 02:54:52.816
(laughter)

4253
02:54:52.816 --> 02:54:54.816
SAM: Yasha and the Orphans.

4254
02:54:59.713 --> 02:55:02.359
MATT: A little more controlled there.

4255
02:55:02.359 --> 02:55:03.920
There we go.

4256
02:55:03.920 --> 02:55:06.441
All right, so now the creature's turn.

4257
02:55:06.441 --> 02:55:08.113
It chases up against you

4258
02:55:08.113 --> 02:55:10.048
and attempts to throw you against the mirror

4259
02:55:10.048 --> 02:55:13.163
with its claws towards your throat.

4260
02:55:13.163 --> 02:55:15.163
It's going to be 18 to hit.

4261
02:55:16.251 --> 02:55:17.240
ASHLEY: Yeah, that hits.

4262
02:55:17.240 --> 02:55:18.265
MATT: All right.

4263
02:55:20.109 --> 02:55:21.017
You take--

4264
02:55:21.017 --> 02:55:23.662
MARISHA: Are you in this mirror land alone?

4265
02:55:23.662 --> 02:55:25.138
MATT: Yep.

4266
02:55:25.138 --> 02:55:27.267
Seven points of piercing damage, reduced to three,

4267
02:55:27.267 --> 02:55:29.627
and you are grappled.

4268
02:55:29.627 --> 02:55:32.526
It's now held your throat against the mirror,

4269
02:55:32.526 --> 02:55:35.032
like slams you against it, the jaw.

4270
02:55:35.032 --> 02:55:36.545
And now it's going to attempt to bite you.

4271
02:55:36.545 --> 02:55:38.782
TALIESIN: Do we have any, did she have any spells on her?

4272
02:55:38.782 --> 02:55:41.317
ASHLEY: Wait, this is an extra attack?

4273
02:55:41.317 --> 02:55:42.207
MATT: It gets-- it got two attacks.

4274
02:55:42.207 --> 02:55:43.822
ASHLEY: Oh fuck.

4275
02:55:43.822 --> 02:55:45.918
MATT: So it grabbed your throat, squeezed you

4276
02:55:45.918 --> 02:55:47.265
and did damage with its claws,

4277
02:55:47.265 --> 02:55:49.948
and then now it's biting towards your face and jaw.

4278
02:55:49.948 --> 02:55:53.265
That's going to be 14 to hit?

4279
02:55:54.145 --> 02:55:55.624
ASHLEY: No, that doesn't hit.
MATT: You have armor class 15.

4280
02:55:55.624 --> 02:55:57.450
You manage to just pull your head away and reach up

4281
02:55:57.450 --> 02:55:58.831
and grab it and hold it at bay.

4282
02:55:58.831 --> 02:56:02.449
The jaws are open like-- trying to bite at you,

4283
02:56:02.449 --> 02:56:04.205
the tongue slamming out,

4284
02:56:04.205 --> 02:56:05.400
spittle is hitting you

4285
02:56:05.400 --> 02:56:07.080
and it's starting to burn the outside of your skin a bit,

4286
02:56:07.080 --> 02:56:08.291
and it's just holding you there.

4287
02:56:08.291 --> 02:56:10.623
The rest of you guys, on the opposite side,

4288
02:56:10.623 --> 02:56:14.683
can see Yasha just vanish into the mirror and gone.

4289
02:56:14.683 --> 02:56:16.131
You have no idea where she is.

4290
02:56:16.131 --> 02:56:17.191
TRAVIS: No semblance of her on the other side?

4291
02:56:17.191 --> 02:56:18.024
MATT: Nope.

4292
02:56:18.024 --> 02:56:19.468
SAM: Does that mirror that she disappeared through

4293
02:56:19.468 --> 02:56:21.967
look any different from any other mirror or--?

4294
02:56:21.967 --> 02:56:23.570
MATT: No, you guys can still see your reflections

4295
02:56:23.570 --> 02:56:25.007
but there's none of Yasha's.

4296
02:56:25.007 --> 02:56:27.483
SAM: That one didn't have a particular frame

4297
02:56:27.483 --> 02:56:28.560
around it or anything?

4298
02:56:28.560 --> 02:56:29.634
MATT: Mm-mm.
SAM: Okay.

4299
02:56:29.634 --> 02:56:30.659
TRAVIS: I will run up to that mirror

4300
02:56:30.659 --> 02:56:32.625
and put my hand against it.

4301
02:56:32.625 --> 02:56:33.879
MATT: Okay.

4302
02:56:33.879 --> 02:56:37.244
You go ahead and put your hand against it?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4303
02:56:37.244 --> 02:56:39.961
MATT: At that moment, the Fjord's face turns,

4304
02:56:39.961 --> 02:56:41.368
and the hand reaches out and grabs you

4305
02:56:41.368 --> 02:56:42.618
and pulls you--

4306
02:56:43.815 --> 02:56:44.648
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

4307
02:56:45.852 --> 02:56:47.846
MATT: Fjord gets pulled through.

4308
02:56:47.846 --> 02:56:48.790
Right next to you.

4309
02:56:48.790 --> 02:56:52.790
Out the side, you watch as out of the shadows in the side,

4310
02:56:52.790 --> 02:56:55.921
apparating a secondary Fjord reaches through

4311
02:56:55.921 --> 02:56:59.920
and pulls your friend Fjord through on that end.

4312
02:56:59.920 --> 02:57:00.753
SAM: Whoa.

4313
02:57:02.210 --> 02:57:03.633
ASHLEY: Why did you come over here!

4314
02:57:03.633 --> 02:57:06.129
MATT: Roll initiative for me, Fjord.

4315
02:57:06.129 --> 02:57:08.117
MARISHA: We all float down here, Fjord.

4316
02:57:08.117 --> 02:57:09.240
TRAVIS: 15.

4317
02:57:09.240 --> 02:57:10.573
MATT: 15, all right.

4318
02:57:13.568 --> 02:57:18.231
So Fjord, you're up first in this round of combat.

4319
02:57:18.231 --> 02:57:19.357
TRAVIS: I'm going to try something.

4320
02:57:19.357 --> 02:57:24.357
Can I grab other Fjord and try and slam him into the mirror?

4321
02:57:25.546 --> 02:57:30.118
MATT: Sure, go ahead and make an attack roll to grapple.

4322
02:57:30.118 --> 02:57:31.106
TRAVIS: 17.

4323
02:57:31.106 --> 02:57:31.939
MATT: 17.

4324
02:57:33.123 --> 02:57:34.144
So you hit.

4325
02:57:34.144 --> 02:57:35.377
This is a contested strength check.

4326
02:57:35.377 --> 02:57:36.960
MARISHA: You don't have a bonus to your attack roll?

4327
02:57:36.960 --> 02:57:38.932
MATT: So go ahead and roll a strength check.

4328
02:57:38.932 --> 02:57:42.814
TRAVIS: Me? No.

4329
02:57:42.814 --> 02:57:43.647
15.

4330
02:57:43.647 --> 02:57:45.519
MATT: 15, it rolled a 10 plus four, 14, you beat it.

4331
02:57:45.519 --> 02:57:47.110
TRAVIS: Ooh!
MATT: So you have it grappled now.

4332
02:57:47.110 --> 02:57:48.110
So your second attack you're going to try

4333
02:57:48.110 --> 02:57:49.288
and slam it against the mirror?

4334
02:57:49.288 --> 02:57:52.623
TRAVIS: Yeah, like-- like both of us go into the mirror.

4335
02:57:52.623 --> 02:57:54.014
MATT: Sure, all right.

4336
02:57:54.014 --> 02:57:56.292
So you go ahead and bring it around.

4337
02:57:56.292 --> 02:57:58.993
Go ahead and roll another strength check with advantage.

4338
02:57:58.993 --> 02:57:59.993
TRAVIS: Advantage.

4339
02:58:02.917 --> 02:58:03.750
18.

4340
02:58:03.750 --> 02:58:04.994
MATT: 18.

4341
02:58:04.994 --> 02:58:07.597
(shattering)

4342
02:58:07.597 --> 02:58:09.355
MATT: It shatters, crumples to the ground,

4343
02:58:09.355 --> 02:58:11.980
splinters falling all over and onto the floor.

4344
02:58:11.980 --> 02:58:14.194
That mirror is destroyed.

4345
02:58:14.194 --> 02:58:15.633
SAM: Wait, how do we get through?!

4346
02:58:15.633 --> 02:58:18.224
MATT: On your guys' end, you watch the mirror

4347
02:58:18.224 --> 02:58:21.077
crack and then crumple onto the ground.

4348
02:58:21.077 --> 02:58:22.556
LIAM: There was no passage or anything--

4349
02:58:22.556 --> 02:58:23.858
TRAVIS: We just land against the wall behind it?

4350
02:58:23.858 --> 02:58:25.360
MATT: Yeah, the wall behind it.

4351
02:58:25.360 --> 02:58:28.322
TRAVIS: Oh, that doesn't work like that.

4352
02:58:28.322 --> 02:58:31.355
TALIESIN: Did it take damage from hitting a--

4353
02:58:31.355 --> 02:58:33.638
MATT: It took strength damage.

4354
02:58:33.638 --> 02:58:34.888
What's your strength modifier?

4355
02:58:34.888 --> 02:58:35.721
TRAVIS: Zero.

4356
02:58:35.721 --> 02:58:37.760
MATT: It takes one point of damage.

4357
02:58:38.943 --> 02:58:41.825
All right, that's your turn. Yasha, you're up next.

4358
02:58:41.825 --> 02:58:42.905
They rolled really low initiative, so.

4359
02:58:42.905 --> 02:58:43.738
ASHLEY: Okay.

4360
02:58:45.488 --> 02:58:46.732
Okay.

4361
02:58:46.732 --> 02:58:48.962
So I have an idea.

4362
02:58:48.962 --> 02:58:52.879
I'm going to step a little bit away from Fjord.

4363
02:58:53.903 --> 02:58:58.259
But I probably can't move. How far away from him am I?

4364
02:58:58.259 --> 02:59:01.801
TRAVIS: Well we are next to each other.

4365
02:59:03.207 --> 02:59:04.040
Right?

4366
02:59:06.545 --> 02:59:09.290
MATT: Yep, yeah, you guys are right side by side.

4367
02:59:09.290 --> 02:59:10.123
TRAVIS: Jesus.

4368
02:59:13.504 --> 02:59:16.365
ASHLEY: Can I move a little bit of--

4369
02:59:16.365 --> 02:59:18.377
more than 10 feet away from him?

4370
02:59:18.377 --> 02:59:20.942
MATT: If you want to.
ASHLEY: Yep.

4371
02:59:20.942 --> 02:59:22.826
MATT: Okay, 10 right there?
ASHLEY: Yeah.

4372
02:59:22.826 --> 02:59:23.809
MATT: Okay, it does get an attack of opportunity

4373
02:59:23.809 --> 02:59:24.851
against you.

4374
02:59:24.851 --> 02:59:26.076
Oh, you can't, you're grappled.

4375
02:59:26.076 --> 02:59:27.273
It has you grappled by the throat.

4376
02:59:27.273 --> 02:59:28.842
ASHLEY: Oh, so I can't move.
MATT: Your speed is zero.

4377
02:59:28.842 --> 02:59:32.200
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'm going to try to

4378
02:59:32.200 --> 02:59:33.708
get out of the grapple then.

4379
02:59:33.708 --> 02:59:35.469
MATT: All right, so your using an action to break it.

4380
02:59:35.469 --> 02:59:36.483
Go ahead and make a strength check.

4381
02:59:36.483 --> 02:59:39.933
You're raging, so you have advantage.

4382
02:59:39.933 --> 02:59:42.619
MARISHA: It'd just be like a doppelganger.

4383
02:59:42.619 --> 02:59:43.786
ASHLEY: Much better.

4384
02:59:46.260 --> 02:59:47.215
18.

4385
02:59:47.215 --> 02:59:48.736
MATT: 18. 21.
ASHLEY: Fuck.

4386
02:59:48.736 --> 02:59:50.552
MATT: You don't break the grapple.
It's still clutching by the throat.

4387
02:59:50.552 --> 02:59:51.956
You try and pull away and it just pulls you back

4388
02:59:51.956 --> 02:59:55.066
and slams you, the jaw opening up a bit,

4389
02:59:55.066 --> 02:59:56.784
and it's just strange and terrifying

4390
02:59:56.784 --> 03:00:00.892
to look into the face of you, but exaggerated.

4391
03:00:00.892 --> 03:00:03.768
The jaw hanging open to a point.

4392
03:00:03.768 --> 03:00:05.601
So that's your action.

4393
03:00:07.406 --> 03:00:11.969
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to try to, for my movement,

4394
03:00:11.969 --> 03:00:15.554
try to at least move this creature with me.

4395
03:00:15.554 --> 03:00:17.503
MATT: You can't, movement speed is zero.

4396
03:00:17.503 --> 03:00:20.429
You're like, being held against the wall.

4397
03:00:20.429 --> 03:00:21.904
That's your turn.
ASHLEY: That's my turn.

4398
03:00:21.904 --> 03:00:23.414
MATT: Now their turn.

4399
03:00:23.414 --> 03:00:26.030
Fjord, against you, it's making two attacks.

4400
03:00:26.030 --> 03:00:28.317
It's going to attempt to go for your throat as well.

4401
03:00:28.317 --> 03:00:31.143
That is a 18 to hit?

4402
03:00:31.143 --> 03:00:32.204
TRAVIS: Hits.

4403
03:00:32.204 --> 03:00:33.281
MATT: All right.

4404
03:00:33.281 --> 03:00:34.198
You take--

4405
03:00:38.307 --> 03:00:41.586
Four points, sorry, eight points of piercing damage.

4406
03:00:41.586 --> 03:00:42.509
TRAVIS: Okay.

4407
03:00:42.509 --> 03:00:43.550
MATT: As the claws like,

4408
03:00:43.550 --> 03:00:46.198
dig into you and grapple your throat and you are grappled.

4409
03:00:46.198 --> 03:00:47.843
TRAVIS: Okay.

4410
03:00:47.843 --> 03:00:50.203
MATT: It's going to attempt to bite you as well.

4411
03:00:50.203 --> 03:00:52.221
That is going to be 16 to hit?

4412
03:00:52.221 --> 03:00:53.234
TRAVIS: Just misses.

4413
03:00:53.234 --> 03:00:55.169
MATT: Dang. Can't get the bite off.

4414
03:00:55.169 --> 03:00:57.460
It tries to bite towards you, and it sinks into your armor.

4415
03:00:57.460 --> 03:00:58.741
TRAVIS: That acid bite or whatever.

4416
03:00:58.741 --> 03:01:00.303
MATT: But the teeth can't pierce through the armor

4417
03:01:00.303 --> 03:01:01.602
and you just shrug it off,

4418
03:01:01.602 --> 03:01:04.167
a tooth breaks off inside the armor as it pulls back,

4419
03:01:04.167 --> 03:01:06.387
but it's still holding you by the throat and the chest.

4420
03:01:06.387 --> 03:01:08.013
All right, top of the round, what are you guys doing?

4421
03:01:08.013 --> 03:01:09.812
You just watched Fjord--
LIAM: I'm taking my vulture

4422
03:01:09.812 --> 03:01:11.896
and plopping it down in front of a mirror

4423
03:01:11.896 --> 03:01:14.918
that was close to it and saying, "Peck that mirror!"

4424
03:01:14.918 --> 03:01:16.694
MATT: That one over there?
LIAM: Say this one here.

4425
03:01:16.694 --> 03:01:17.694
Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

4426
03:01:18.994 --> 03:01:20.603
Roll an attack for your--

4427
03:01:20.603 --> 03:01:21.965
LIAM: I don't want him to attack,

4428
03:01:21.965 --> 03:01:23.943
I just want him to tap and see if anything happens to it.

4429
03:01:23.943 --> 03:01:25.477
MATT: Okay, he taps and taps.

4430
03:01:25.477 --> 03:01:26.634
LIAM: Yep.
MATT: He's tapping the mirror.

4431
03:01:26.634 --> 03:01:28.249
LIAM: Well, <i>Scheiße</i>.

4432
03:01:28.249 --> 03:01:30.245
MARISHA: I look at the piece of mirror

4433
03:01:30.245 --> 03:01:33.437
that I picked up from the ground.

4434
03:01:33.437 --> 03:01:34.270
And--

4435
03:01:34.270 --> 03:01:36.420
MATT: You see your reflection.

4436
03:01:36.420 --> 03:01:38.170
MARISHA: Just my reflection?
MATT: Yeah.

4437
03:01:41.859 --> 03:01:44.192
MARISHA: It's a tiny piece of mirror.

4438
03:01:45.071 --> 03:01:46.487
TRAVIS: If you look at your reflection and her reflection--

4439
03:01:46.487 --> 03:01:47.988
I'm not there.

4440
03:01:47.988 --> 03:01:50.935
MARISHA: What if I take this piece of mirror

4441
03:01:50.935 --> 03:01:53.135
and I hold it up to the mirror?

4442
03:01:53.135 --> 03:01:54.129
MATT: Okay.

4443
03:01:54.129 --> 03:01:55.775
(laughter)

4444
03:01:55.775 --> 03:01:58.341
TRAVIS: Hey man, this is all good stuff!

4445
03:01:58.341 --> 03:01:59.442
MATT: So which mirror do you go to?

4446
03:01:59.442 --> 03:02:01.846
You guys are on the opposite side of this.

4447
03:02:01.846 --> 03:02:02.679
MARISHA: Uh--

4448
03:02:02.679 --> 03:02:03.513
LIAM: I'm taking a pretzel.

4449
03:02:03.513 --> 03:02:05.332
MARISHA: (uncertain nonsense)

4450
03:02:05.332 --> 03:02:07.989
I'll go to one of these over here.

4451
03:02:07.989 --> 03:02:09.408
MATT: Over here?
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

4452
03:02:09.408 --> 03:02:11.502
MATT: Okay. So you hold it up and look,

4453
03:02:11.502 --> 03:02:14.168
and you can see your reflection in the mirror of reflection.

4454
03:02:14.168 --> 03:02:16.732
It's one of those infinite reflections.

4455
03:02:16.732 --> 03:02:18.982
MARISHA: That feels even more fucked up.

4456
03:02:20.572 --> 03:02:22.856
MATT: Nott, Jester, anybody?

4457
03:02:22.856 --> 03:02:23.689
Caduceus?

4458
03:02:24.596 --> 03:02:25.779
SAM: I-I-I'm--

4459
03:02:25.779 --> 03:02:27.994
TALIESIN: I am trying to--

4460
03:02:27.994 --> 03:02:29.837
there was something in here before,

4461
03:02:29.837 --> 03:02:31.904
I am just trying to keep my eye open

4462
03:02:31.904 --> 03:02:33.210
and look at all these mirrors

4463
03:02:33.210 --> 03:02:36.818
and see anything that's happening in this room right now.

4464
03:02:36.818 --> 03:02:38.602
MATT: Okay, you're moving into another area?

4465
03:02:38.602 --> 03:02:39.435
Where are you moving?

4466
03:02:39.435 --> 03:02:41.230
TALIESIN: I'm sort of staying where everything is happening,

4467
03:02:41.230 --> 03:02:43.493
but I'm just keeping an eye out, yeah.

4468
03:02:43.493 --> 03:02:45.493
MATT: Okay, make a perception check.

4469
03:02:45.493 --> 03:02:46.326
TALIESIN: Okay.

4470
03:02:47.764 --> 03:02:49.020
25.

4471
03:02:49.020 --> 03:02:50.561
MATT: 25?
Okay.

4472
03:02:50.561 --> 03:02:52.795
You glance around from a distance in the middle

4473
03:02:52.795 --> 03:02:55.246
and you don't see anything beyond the reflections

4474
03:02:55.246 --> 03:02:57.804
of your allies and stuff that are scattered in the mirrors.

4475
03:02:57.804 --> 03:03:02.497
On the far end, you see, in the reflection of the wall--

4476
03:03:02.497 --> 03:03:04.024
you don't see the wall that's facing it,

4477
03:03:04.024 --> 03:03:05.723
but in the reflection you can see

4478
03:03:05.723 --> 03:03:09.082
a dagger jammed into the stone of the wall.

4479
03:03:09.082 --> 03:03:11.151
Like an ivory handled dagger.

4480
03:03:11.151 --> 03:03:12.891
SAM: In our room or in the reflection?

4481
03:03:12.891 --> 03:03:14.257
MATT: He sees it in the reflection.

4482
03:03:14.257 --> 03:03:15.596
He can't see the opposite wall

4483
03:03:15.596 --> 03:03:16.468
because of the way he's looking at it,

4484
03:03:16.468 --> 03:03:18.393
it's blocked around this side,

4485
03:03:18.393 --> 03:03:22.052
but you're looking into this mirror
and you can see the reflection off this.

4486
03:03:22.052 --> 03:03:24.422
TALIESIN: I'm going to move to see if I can--

4487
03:03:24.422 --> 03:03:26.680
is there a way to see that real wall

4488
03:03:26.680 --> 03:03:29.193
and still stay in contact with everybody,

4489
03:03:29.193 --> 03:03:30.809
leave like visual contact with everybody?

4490
03:03:30.809 --> 03:03:32.547
MATT: Yeah, move through that area.
TALIESIN: I want to move through that area.

4491
03:03:32.547 --> 03:03:34.861
MATT: Okay, you look off to the side, no dagger.

4492
03:03:34.861 --> 03:03:36.186
MARISHA: What!

4493
03:03:37.240 --> 03:03:39.231
TRAVIS: What the fuck does that mean!
MARISHA: Oh!

4494
03:03:39.231 --> 03:03:41.734
Oh!

4495
03:03:41.734 --> 03:03:42.892
TRAVIS: Reach for it!

4496
03:03:42.892 --> 03:03:43.760
MATT: That finishes your guys' go,

4497
03:03:43.760 --> 03:03:44.940
we're back now in combat, top of the round,

4498
03:03:44.940 --> 03:03:46.304
Fjord, your turn.

4499
03:03:46.304 --> 03:03:48.156
Still grappled and held by this version of Fjord

4500
03:03:48.156 --> 03:03:49.515
and you now see the edges of its mouth,

4501
03:03:49.515 --> 03:03:50.990
the flesh has pulled open and torn

4502
03:03:50.990 --> 03:03:53.625
and the jaw hinges up by the ear

4503
03:03:53.625 --> 03:03:55.791
and it's just like a Venom--

4504
03:03:55.791 --> 03:03:56.896
opening up.
TRAVIS: Oh, god!

4505
03:03:56.896 --> 03:03:58.844
From where I'm at in this new space,

4506
03:03:58.844 --> 03:04:02.660
does it duplicate where Yasha and I just were?

4507
03:04:04.591 --> 03:04:06.103
Is this-- do I feel like we're--

4508
03:04:06.103 --> 03:04:08.148
MATT: You guys are in the reverse of where you started.

4509
03:04:08.148 --> 03:04:09.563
TRAVIS: So from where I am, would I know where

4510
03:04:09.563 --> 03:04:12.359
that crystal area was that looked like the glacier?

4511
03:04:12.359 --> 03:04:13.960
MATT: Correct. It would be this way.

4512
03:04:13.960 --> 03:04:16.145
TRAVIS: That direction, okay.

4513
03:04:16.145 --> 03:04:18.895
I will ♪ fucking cast ♪

4514
03:04:18.895 --> 03:04:21.609
♪ Armor of Agathys on myself. ♪

4515
03:04:21.609 --> 03:04:23.783
MATT: Okay and that's at 5th-level?

4516
03:04:23.783 --> 03:04:25.468
TRAVIS: At 5th-level, so that will be--

4517
03:04:25.468 --> 03:04:26.679
MATT: 25 temporary hit points.

4518
03:04:26.679 --> 03:04:28.783
And 25 cold damage to anything that hits you.

4519
03:04:28.783 --> 03:04:29.695
TRAVIS: That's right.
MATT: You got it.

4520
03:04:29.695 --> 03:04:31.012
ASHLEY: Oh, wow.

4521
03:04:31.012 --> 03:04:32.446
MATT: While you have those temporary hit points.

4522
03:04:32.446 --> 03:04:34.537
TRAVIS: Yeah, and with my bonus action,

4523
03:04:34.537 --> 03:04:37.904
I will cast Hex on that son of a bitch.

4524
03:04:39.918 --> 03:04:40.971
MATT: Bonus action?

4525
03:04:40.971 --> 03:04:42.744
This is you Hexblade's Curse or just Hex?

4526
03:04:42.744 --> 03:04:45.735
TRAVIS: I'm sorry, Hexblade's--

4527
03:04:46.844 --> 03:04:47.819
no, save it.

4528
03:04:47.819 --> 03:04:48.652
I won't do it, yep.

4529
03:04:48.652 --> 03:04:49.875
MATT: Okay, you got it.

4530
03:04:49.875 --> 03:04:51.197
Okay, that finishes your turn.

4531
03:04:51.197 --> 03:04:52.847
Yasha, your turn.

4532
03:04:52.847 --> 03:04:54.644
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to attack.

4533
03:04:54.644 --> 03:04:55.709
MATT: Go for it.

4534
03:04:55.709 --> 03:04:56.542
ASHLEY: Okay.

4535
03:04:56.542 --> 03:04:58.846
MATT: So take two strikes at the creature.

4536
03:04:58.846 --> 03:05:00.417
You're currently still held in its grasp.

4537
03:05:00.417 --> 03:05:01.463
It's like holding you up against the wall.

4538
03:05:01.463 --> 03:05:02.922
It's trying to now go in for

4539
03:05:02.922 --> 03:05:05.050
another sort of open-jawed bite

4540
03:05:05.050 --> 03:05:06.717
towards your face and throat.

4541
03:05:06.717 --> 03:05:07.800
ASHLEY: Natural 20.

4542
03:05:07.800 --> 03:05:09.384
MATT: (laughing)

4543
03:05:09.384 --> 03:05:10.406
TRAVIS: Hit that shit.

4544
03:05:10.406 --> 03:05:11.933
MATT: All right so you roll--

4545
03:05:11.933 --> 03:05:14.004
so you roll your damage plus an additional d6.

4546
03:05:14.004 --> 03:05:15.362
TRAVIS: Let 'em know.

4547
03:05:16.348 --> 03:05:18.135
MATT: The additional d6 after the fact.

4548
03:05:18.135 --> 03:05:21.041
So roll for your regular damage first.

4549
03:05:21.041 --> 03:05:24.310
That includes your additional 2d6,

4550
03:05:24.310 --> 03:05:26.227
plus your additional--

4551
03:05:27.973 --> 03:05:30.951
You have your third d6 from your ability, right?

4552
03:05:30.951 --> 03:05:31.784
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MATT: First attack.

4553
03:05:31.784 --> 03:05:33.373
So roll that as well.

4554
03:05:33.373 --> 03:05:36.205
Double those dice together.

4555
03:05:36.205 --> 03:05:37.682
ASHLEY: Nine.

4556
03:05:37.682 --> 03:05:39.599
MATT: That's eighteen plus?

4557
03:05:41.533 --> 03:05:44.802
ASHLEY: Oh, I see, plus seven.

4558
03:05:44.802 --> 03:05:45.935
MATT: Okay.

4559
03:05:45.935 --> 03:05:47.335
So 25.

4560
03:05:50.595 --> 03:05:54.829
Then add your additional d6 for your brutal critical.

4561
03:05:54.829 --> 03:05:56.544
TRAVIS: Yep.
ASHLEY: Oh, I see.

4562
03:05:56.544 --> 03:05:57.461
Okay, okay.

4563
03:05:58.864 --> 03:05:59.948
That's an extra two.

4564
03:05:59.948 --> 03:06:01.224
MATT: That's 27 points of damage.

4565
03:06:01.224 --> 03:06:02.104
SAM: Nice!

4566
03:06:02.104 --> 03:06:04.267
MATT: All right, how do you want to do this?

4567
03:06:04.267 --> 03:06:05.274
SAM: Whoa!

4568
03:06:05.274 --> 03:06:06.923
Okay, okay!

4569
03:06:06.923 --> 03:06:08.012
TRAVIS: How many points of damage was it?

4570
03:06:08.012 --> 03:06:09.137
SAM: 27.
ASHLEY: 27.

4571
03:06:10.251 --> 03:06:11.823
So that's not high.

4572
03:06:11.823 --> 03:06:13.834
Okay.

4573
03:06:13.834 --> 03:06:15.209
Okay, so--
MATT: It's clutching you,

4574
03:06:15.209 --> 03:06:16.142
holding you against the wall.

4575
03:06:16.142 --> 03:06:18.156
You get one heavy slash off on it.

4576
03:06:18.156 --> 03:06:22.486
ASHLEY: I would just actually like to, if I could,

4577
03:06:22.486 --> 03:06:24.537
take the mouth and then just rip.

4578
03:06:24.537 --> 03:06:27.760
MATT: Okay, so the blade is too close to you,

4579
03:06:27.760 --> 03:06:29.689
you just let it fall to the ground,

4580
03:06:29.689 --> 03:06:31.142
reach forward, grab the front of its face

4581
03:06:31.142 --> 03:06:33.487
and just-- until it snaps.

4582
03:06:33.487 --> 03:06:37.102
As it does you watch its head snap,

4583
03:06:37.102 --> 03:06:41.277
the Yasha visage immediately drop

4584
03:06:41.277 --> 03:06:44.683
and you see this thin, featureless, just gray,

4585
03:06:44.683 --> 03:06:49.516
fleshy, stringy humanoid creature just fall to the ground.

4586
03:06:50.749 --> 03:06:52.181
ASHLEY: Okay.

4587
03:06:52.181 --> 03:06:57.181
Now for movement, I want to get closer to Fjord.

4588
03:06:57.181 --> 03:06:58.635
MATT: You do have another attack, right?

4589
03:06:58.635 --> 03:07:00.919
ASHLEY: Yeah, so I'll take an attack on--

4590
03:07:00.919 --> 03:07:03.142
MATT: Okay. You can move around to try and--

4591
03:07:03.142 --> 03:07:04.487
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll flank.

4592
03:07:04.487 --> 03:07:05.320
MATT: Okay.

4593
03:07:06.381 --> 03:07:07.464
ASHLEY: Okay.

4594
03:07:09.945 --> 03:07:12.241
That would be an 18.

4595
03:07:12.241 --> 03:07:13.725
MATT: That hits, go ahead and roll damage.

4596
03:07:13.725 --> 03:07:14.958
ASHLEY: Okay.

4597
03:07:17.487 --> 03:07:18.322
Okay.

4598
03:07:18.322 --> 03:07:19.373
TALIESIN: I am--

4599
03:07:19.373 --> 03:07:20.802
ASHLEY: 14 points of damage.

4600
03:07:20.802 --> 03:07:22.721
MATT: 14 points of damage.

4601
03:07:22.721 --> 03:07:26.588
All right so, you strike it in the back,

4602
03:07:26.588 --> 03:07:28.144
hisses at you over its shoulder,

4603
03:07:28.144 --> 03:07:30.293
and it's just going to keep going into you, Fjord.

4604
03:07:30.293 --> 03:07:32.101
It's going to attempt to bite you twice

4605
03:07:32.101 --> 03:07:33.234
that you're grappled.

4606
03:07:33.234 --> 03:07:34.827
First attack.

4607
03:07:34.827 --> 03:07:37.491
That's a 12, that misses.

4608
03:07:37.491 --> 03:07:39.453
Kind of hold it at bay.

4609
03:07:39.453 --> 03:07:42.290
Second attack, that's a natural 18,

4610
03:07:42.290 --> 03:07:45.801
which is a critical against a grappled creature.

4611
03:07:45.801 --> 03:07:47.782
TRAVIS: Whoa. Shit. Fuck. Balls.

4612
03:07:47.782 --> 03:07:50.331
MATT: So you take 12 points of piercing damage.

4613
03:07:50.331 --> 03:07:51.364
TRAVIS: Okay.

4614
03:07:51.364 --> 03:07:54.651
And he takes 25 points of cold damage.

4615
03:07:54.651 --> 03:07:55.484
MATT: Correct.

4616
03:07:56.569 --> 03:08:00.443
Plus you take an additional seven points of acid damage.

4617
03:08:00.443 --> 03:08:02.854
TRAVIS: Oh, okay, got it.

4618
03:08:02.854 --> 03:08:05.195
Still got some Armor of Agathys left.

4619
03:08:05.195 --> 03:08:06.343
MATT: He is fucked up.

4620
03:08:06.343 --> 03:08:07.702
You watch as the bite goes into you.

4621
03:08:07.702 --> 03:08:10.752
He pulls back and there's ice shards jammed into his face.

4622
03:08:10.752 --> 03:08:12.143
TRAVIS: Yeah!
MATT: Up into like one eye,

4623
03:08:12.143 --> 03:08:15.009
is completely impaled and it's just--

4624
03:08:15.009 --> 03:08:16.973
pulls away and its jaw is frozen open at the moment.

4625
03:08:16.973 --> 03:08:18.784
TRAVIS: Don't fuck with the winter porcupine.

4626
03:08:18.784 --> 03:08:20.927
MATT: You also-- as you grin in the back,

4627
03:08:20.927 --> 03:08:23.628
you see a shadow coming from behind towards Yasha,

4628
03:08:23.628 --> 03:08:28.628
and you see this scraggly-haired, scarf wearing,

4629
03:08:28.699 --> 03:08:31.186
hooded, Caleb come up from behind.

4630
03:08:31.186 --> 03:08:32.264
SAM: Whoa, what?

4631
03:08:32.264 --> 03:08:33.518
MARISHA: Wait, what?

4632
03:08:33.518 --> 03:08:34.458
LIAM: Because we're in the room,

4633
03:08:34.458 --> 03:08:35.949
there's dupes of us in there,

4634
03:08:35.949 --> 03:08:37.339
and we can't see any of this from our side.

4635
03:08:37.339 --> 03:08:38.185
MATT: No, you cannot.

4636
03:08:38.185 --> 03:08:39.748
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.
SAM: Oh, no.

4637
03:08:39.748 --> 03:08:40.736
LIAM: Fucking cool.

4638
03:08:40.736 --> 03:08:43.302
MATT: So Yasha, you're getting claw attack on you.

4639
03:08:43.302 --> 03:08:44.444
Natural 18.

4640
03:08:45.649 --> 03:08:48.386
So that's going to be 26 to hit you.

4641
03:08:48.386 --> 03:08:50.294
ASHLEY: That hits.
SAM: Caleb doesn't have claws.

4642
03:08:51.365 --> 03:08:53.998
MATT: That's so weird.
SAM: Weird.

4643
03:08:53.998 --> 03:08:57.571
MATT: You take 10 points of piercing damage
reduced to five, because you're raging.

4644
03:08:57.571 --> 03:08:59.237
ASHLEY: Yep.

4645
03:08:59.237 --> 03:09:02.007
MATT: It's going to attempt to bite you.

4646
03:09:02.007 --> 03:09:03.253
Natural 20.

4647
03:09:03.253 --> 03:09:04.743
Straight up.
ASHLEY: Okay.

4648
03:09:04.743 --> 03:09:06.013
MATT: CR symbol on the die.

4649
03:09:06.013 --> 03:09:07.180
So you take--

4650
03:09:11.528 --> 03:09:13.198
10 points of piercing damage, reduced to five.

4651
03:09:13.198 --> 03:09:14.390
ASHLEY: 'Kay.

4652
03:09:14.390 --> 03:09:15.223
MATT: And--

4653
03:09:16.826 --> 03:09:18.510
Eight points of acid damage.

4654
03:09:18.510 --> 03:09:19.701
TRAVIS: Could've been worse.

4655
03:09:19.701 --> 03:09:22.143
MATT: Could've been worse,
he rolled really shitty on those rolls.

4656
03:09:22.143 --> 03:09:22.976
ASHLEY: Okay.

4657
03:09:22.976 --> 03:09:26.293
MATT: Now you have a feral Caleb leapt onto your back

4658
03:09:26.293 --> 03:09:28.248
and tearing into your shoulder,

4659
03:09:28.248 --> 03:09:29.783
the back of your neck and ears,

4660
03:09:29.783 --> 03:09:31.362
you can just feel the warmth of the blood

4661
03:09:31.362 --> 03:09:33.506
pooling the down the side of your neck.

4662
03:09:33.506 --> 03:09:35.223
Everybody else, on your side of the room,

4663
03:09:35.223 --> 03:09:36.109
what are you doing?

4664
03:09:36.109 --> 03:09:37.582
TRAVIS: Jester is saying that she would

4665
03:09:37.582 --> 03:09:40.659
definitely go through the mirror after Fjord.

4666
03:09:40.659 --> 03:09:42.076
TALIESIN: Quick question.

4667
03:09:44.570 --> 03:09:46.891
Is that dagger showing up in any of the other reflections

4668
03:09:46.891 --> 03:09:48.393
that I can see of that little corner?

4669
03:09:48.393 --> 03:09:50.619
Is it just that one mirror?

4670
03:09:50.619 --> 03:09:51.672
MATT: You want to try and arrange yourself

4671
03:09:51.672 --> 03:09:53.531
to see if the dagger is visible from another angle?

4672
03:09:53.531 --> 03:09:54.364
TALIESIN: Well, I mean like--

4673
03:09:54.364 --> 03:09:56.207
I can see it physically right now, right?

4674
03:09:56.207 --> 03:09:58.117
I mean I can see the lack of it physically.

4675
03:09:58.117 --> 03:09:59.712
MATT: Correct.

4676
03:09:59.712 --> 03:10:01.969
TALIESIN: Is that chunk reflected in any other mirror

4677
03:10:01.969 --> 03:10:03.772
right now where I can see if it's in another reflection

4678
03:10:03.772 --> 03:10:05.539
or is it just that one that I was looking at

4679
03:10:05.539 --> 03:10:06.744
that saw that it was there?

4680
03:10:06.744 --> 03:10:07.676
MATT: From where you're looking,

4681
03:10:07.676 --> 03:10:08.541
none of the other walls

4682
03:10:08.541 --> 03:10:11.014
from you're sitting in the reflections have a dagger.

4683
03:10:11.014 --> 03:10:12.140
If you want to try to arrange yourself

4684
03:10:12.140 --> 03:10:14.744
to look through another mirror where that would be.

4685
03:10:14.744 --> 03:10:15.577
Is that what you want to do?

4686
03:10:15.577 --> 03:10:16.941
TALIESIN: No, no, no.

4687
03:10:16.941 --> 03:10:19.260
I was just trying to see if it was like--

4688
03:10:19.260 --> 03:10:21.122
the idea being I was seeing if it was

4689
03:10:21.122 --> 03:10:23.203
just one special mirror that was showing up in.

4690
03:10:23.203 --> 03:10:24.964
MATT: Got you, so you're looking at another mirror

4691
03:10:24.964 --> 03:10:26.747
at a certain angle to see?

4692
03:10:26.747 --> 03:10:28.115
TALIESIN: Yeah, just--

4693
03:10:28.115 --> 03:10:29.515
MATT: Okay, so you move off to the side

4694
03:10:29.515 --> 03:10:31.192
and looking through another mirror in that same space,

4695
03:10:31.192 --> 03:10:34.434
you can see the dagger does exist in the reflection.

4696
03:10:34.434 --> 03:10:35.746
MARISHA: Are you communicating this?

4697
03:10:35.746 --> 03:10:36.579
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4698
03:10:36.579 --> 03:10:37.816
There's-- yeah, okay.

4699
03:10:37.816 --> 03:10:38.855
I'm going to try a mirror.

4700
03:10:38.855 --> 03:10:40.768
Let's see if we can pull everybody out, I guess?

4701
03:10:40.768 --> 03:10:42.576
LIAM: Do what?

4702
03:10:42.576 --> 03:10:44.719
TALIESIN: Seems to be the thing to do, I guess.

4703
03:10:44.719 --> 03:10:45.983
MARISHA: Well, if it's on that side,

4704
03:10:45.983 --> 03:10:47.720
maybe that's the lever to get them back out?

4705
03:10:47.720 --> 03:10:49.520
TALIESIN: I'm going to

4706
03:10:49.520 --> 03:10:52.482
head towards the closest mirror to that dagger.

4707
03:10:52.482 --> 03:10:53.315
MATT: Okay.

4708
03:10:53.315 --> 03:10:55.704
You run towards the mirror
that you saw the dagger in?

4709
03:10:55.704 --> 03:10:57.360
MARISHA: I'll follow after Caduceus.

4710
03:10:57.360 --> 03:10:59.030
TALIESIN: I'm going to-- yeah, steady myself

4711
03:10:59.030 --> 03:11:01.515
and I know-- I'm prepared to pull.

4712
03:11:01.515 --> 03:11:02.356
MATT: Okay. Yeah.

4713
03:11:02.356 --> 03:11:04.357
You run straight for it,

4714
03:11:04.357 --> 03:11:06.807
sprain your arm a little bit.

4715
03:11:06.807 --> 03:11:08.623
You pull back--
TALIESIN: Oh.

4716
03:11:08.623 --> 03:11:13.096
MATT: -- and as you look at your hand and look forward,

4717
03:11:13.096 --> 03:11:17.881
you can see the reflection of the Caduceus doing this.

4718
03:11:17.881 --> 03:11:19.761
And pulls you in.

4719
03:11:19.761 --> 03:11:21.958
TRAVIS: Jester's going to try and do the same thing

4720
03:11:21.958 --> 03:11:23.500
with the nearest mirror.

4721
03:11:23.500 --> 03:11:26.108
MARISHA: I'm going to dart around after

4722
03:11:26.108 --> 03:11:28.416
seeing what Caduceus saw

4723
03:11:28.416 --> 03:11:32.219
and see if I can find anything else hiding.

4724
03:11:32.219 --> 03:11:34.086
MATT: All right. One second.

4725
03:11:34.086 --> 03:11:36.506
I don't have a secondary Caduceus figure here,

4726
03:11:36.506 --> 03:11:37.555
so we're just going to put a gnoll,

4727
03:11:37.555 --> 03:11:39.340
because you're both tall and furry.

4728
03:11:39.340 --> 03:11:41.385
TALIESIN: That's cool.
MATT: You're fine.

4729
03:11:41.385 --> 03:11:42.918
TALIESIN: You want my initiative roll?

4730
03:11:42.918 --> 03:11:44.571
MATT: Yes, if you don't mind.

4731
03:11:44.571 --> 03:11:46.125
TALIESIN: Natural 20, 21.

4732
03:11:46.125 --> 03:11:48.042
SAM: That's like your fifth one of the night.

4733
03:11:48.042 --> 03:11:49.367
MATT: That's insane.

4734
03:11:49.367 --> 03:11:50.200
TALIESIN: I know.

4735
03:11:50.200 --> 03:11:52.606
TRAVIS: I guess if that mirror exploded,

4736
03:11:52.606 --> 03:11:53.900
she would go to the nearest mirror

4737
03:11:53.900 --> 03:11:56.073
and put her hand on, trying to duplicate

4738
03:11:56.073 --> 03:11:57.841
what she saw Yasha and Fjord do.

4739
03:11:57.841 --> 03:11:58.676
MATT: Okay.

4740
03:11:58.676 --> 03:12:01.780
She goes up and puts her hand on the reflection.

4741
03:12:01.780 --> 03:12:04.682
The hand stands there against hers.

4742
03:12:04.682 --> 03:12:05.700
No reaction.

4743
03:12:05.700 --> 03:12:07.542
MARISHA: Oh. That's all of them maybe.

4744
03:12:07.542 --> 03:12:09.626
TRAVIS: She flicks off her own reflection.

4745
03:12:09.626 --> 03:12:11.709
MATT: Flicks off back at her.

4746
03:12:13.132 --> 03:12:14.590
TRAVIS: She'll run over to another mirror

4747
03:12:14.590 --> 03:12:15.423
and try another one.

4748
03:12:16.626 --> 03:12:17.701
MATT: Nothing.

4749
03:12:21.000 --> 03:12:22.284
Anybody else going to do anything?

4750
03:12:22.284 --> 03:12:23.982
LIAM: Can you remind me what the nature of the egg things

4751
03:12:23.982 --> 03:12:25.782
were, you were saying on that doorway?

4752
03:12:25.782 --> 03:12:27.503
Also, where is that in this room?

4753
03:12:27.503 --> 03:12:29.498
MATT: In this room, it would be on this area,

4754
03:12:29.498 --> 03:12:31.607
on the opposite side.

4755
03:12:31.607 --> 03:12:34.080
SAM: Nott's going to just walk down this hall

4756
03:12:34.080 --> 03:12:35.820
and see if anything is over there,

4757
03:12:35.820 --> 03:12:39.224
watching us or in the room with us.

4758
03:12:39.224 --> 03:12:40.287
MATT: Okay.
SAM: Looking around.

4759
03:12:40.287 --> 03:12:42.069
MATT: Make a perception check.

4760
03:12:42.069 --> 03:12:43.745
SAM: Okay. Seven.

4761
03:12:43.745 --> 03:12:45.181
MATT: Seven, nothing.

4762
03:12:45.181 --> 03:12:47.436
LIAM: Is Caleb-- I can't tell because we're not in here now,

4763
03:12:47.436 --> 03:12:50.340
is Caleb anywhere near that gate or door or whatever it is?

4764
03:12:50.340 --> 03:12:53.132
MATT: You guys moved back.
If you look at the mirror opposite,

4765
03:12:53.132 --> 03:12:56.756
you guys moved back into this chamber to prepare for the--

4766
03:12:56.756 --> 03:12:59.229
LIAM: So way beyond 30 feet of movement to look at that?

4767
03:12:59.229 --> 03:13:00.197
MATT: Correct.

4768
03:13:00.197 --> 03:13:02.938
TRAVIS: The glacier wall?
LIAM: Yeah.

4769
03:13:02.938 --> 03:13:04.904
I'm not jumping in the mirror,

4770
03:13:04.904 --> 03:13:06.121
it doesn't seem to make any sense.

4771
03:13:06.121 --> 03:13:08.385
I'm going to start running towards that door

4772
03:13:08.385 --> 03:13:10.410
and try to get within sight of it.

4773
03:13:10.410 --> 03:13:12.236
MATT: You got it. All right.

4774
03:13:12.236 --> 03:13:14.259
SAM: Something was delivered to you, Matt, next to you.

4775
03:13:14.259 --> 03:13:15.092
MATT: Oh, there it is.

4776
03:13:15.092 --> 03:13:16.667
My old Caduceus figure.
TALIESIN: Hey!

4777
03:13:16.667 --> 03:13:17.916
MATT: Even better.
LIAM: That's nice.

4778
03:13:17.916 --> 03:13:20.233
MATT: The one I hand made from when he first came in.

4779
03:13:20.233 --> 03:13:21.848
That's much better.

4780
03:13:21.848 --> 03:13:23.508
TALIESIN: Okay.

4781
03:13:23.508 --> 03:13:25.174
MARISHA: Do I still have enough time to see if I see

4782
03:13:25.174 --> 03:13:28.525
anything else that's in the mirrors that's not in this room?

4783
03:13:28.525 --> 03:13:30.081
MATT: Sure, make a perception check.

4784
03:13:30.081 --> 03:13:30.914
You're moving around.

4785
03:13:30.914 --> 03:13:32.655
You have pretty decent movement. So you're like (darting).

4786
03:13:32.655 --> 03:13:36.006
MARISHA: Darting, looking for things like what Caduceus saw.

4787
03:13:36.006 --> 03:13:36.981
Perception check?

4788
03:13:36.981 --> 03:13:38.202
MATT: Yes.

4789
03:13:38.202 --> 03:13:39.352
MARISHA: Those are always bad, eight.

4790
03:13:39.352 --> 03:13:41.334
MATT: Eight, nothing's catching your eye, unfortunately.

4791
03:13:41.334 --> 03:13:42.317
MARISHA: All right.

4792
03:13:43.167 --> 03:13:44.560
MATT: Travis.

4793
03:13:44.560 --> 03:13:45.764
TRAVIS: I love it.

4794
03:13:45.764 --> 03:13:48.027
MATT: All right so, top of the round, Caduceus.

4795
03:13:48.027 --> 03:13:50.802
You now have a version of Caduceus looming ahead of you,

4796
03:13:50.802 --> 03:13:53.787
but it seems to almost bend down even further

4797
03:13:53.787 --> 03:13:55.658
in a feral stance, arms bowed forward

4798
03:13:55.658 --> 03:13:58.795
and it's growling at you.

4799
03:13:58.795 --> 03:14:03.439
TALIESIN: I'm going to-- am I within reach,

4800
03:14:03.439 --> 03:14:05.165
so if I get away from it

4801
03:14:05.165 --> 03:14:06.443
it'll get an attack of opportunity on me?

4802
03:14:06.443 --> 03:14:08.244
MATT: Most likely.
TALIESIN: Okay.

4803
03:14:08.244 --> 03:14:12.080
I'm going to roll around it a little bit

4804
03:14:12.080 --> 03:14:16.100
to see what else is happening in here, just to get a sense--

4805
03:14:16.100 --> 03:14:17.522
MATT: Glancing off through the fog in the space,

4806
03:14:17.522 --> 03:14:19.402
you can see there is that dagger

4807
03:14:19.402 --> 03:14:21.190
that's jammed in the wall there,

4808
03:14:21.190 --> 03:14:23.213
and then down the way you can see both

4809
03:14:23.213 --> 03:14:26.155
Fjord currently grappling with a secondary Fjord

4810
03:14:26.155 --> 03:14:27.621
and Yasha behind that

4811
03:14:27.621 --> 03:14:30.020
and then Caleb leapt up onto Yasha's back

4812
03:14:30.020 --> 03:14:31.343
tearing into her shoulder.

4813
03:14:31.343 --> 03:14:33.767
TALIESIN: There's a lot happening in here.

4814
03:14:33.767 --> 03:14:35.094
(laughter)

4815
03:14:35.094 --> 03:14:37.457
I'm going to--
TRAVIS: Run, we're hiding.

4816
03:14:37.457 --> 03:14:41.055
TALIESIN: -- position myself so that I can grab the dagger

4817
03:14:41.055 --> 03:14:42.481
once I'm cool.

4818
03:14:42.481 --> 03:14:43.798
MATT: Okay.

4819
03:14:43.798 --> 03:14:46.301
You have to move out of its combat range.

4820
03:14:46.301 --> 03:14:47.571
TALIESIN: Which direction is the dagger?

4821
03:14:47.571 --> 03:14:48.926
The dagger is right there, it's in that corner.

4822
03:14:48.926 --> 03:14:49.915
TALIESIN: Okay, so I know it is there.

4823
03:14:49.915 --> 03:14:50.748
MATT: Yes.

4824
03:14:51.647 --> 03:14:53.120
TALIESIN: All right, first thing I'm going to do

4825
03:14:53.120 --> 03:14:56.906
is I'm going to move out of its combat range
and let it take a swipe.

4826
03:14:56.906 --> 03:14:57.974
MATT: All right.

4827
03:14:57.974 --> 03:14:59.281
It's going to attempt to hit you with the claws.

4828
03:14:59.281 --> 03:15:00.308
TALIESIN: Sure.

4829
03:15:00.308 --> 03:15:01.969
MATT: That is going to be 18 to hit.

4830
03:15:01.969 --> 03:15:03.448
TALIESIN: Oh my-- ah, my AC is 18.

4831
03:15:03.448 --> 03:15:04.882
MATT: Is it?
That hits.

4832
03:15:04.882 --> 03:15:06.541
TALIESIN: Damn it.
MATT: Sorry, buddy.

4833
03:15:06.541 --> 03:15:07.966
You take--

4834
03:15:09.799 --> 03:15:11.466
Eight points of piercing damage

4835
03:15:11.466 --> 03:15:13.693
and you are grappled so you cannot move away from it.

4836
03:15:13.693 --> 03:15:16.648
So you try and move and it just slashes
and holds you, pulls you in place.

4837
03:15:16.648 --> 03:15:18.897
TALIESIN: That's fine, that's fine.

4838
03:15:18.897 --> 03:15:20.023
As long as I've got this up.

4839
03:15:20.023 --> 03:15:22.035
In that case, I'm going to--

4840
03:15:22.035 --> 03:15:23.635
TRAVIS: Did we hear him come in?

4841
03:15:23.635 --> 03:15:24.941
Like racket or sound or--?

4842
03:15:24.941 --> 03:15:26.231
MATT: You hear him say that as he comes in,

4843
03:15:26.231 --> 03:15:27.480
"Things are weird!"

4844
03:15:27.480 --> 03:15:29.177
Well you're in the process of grappling with yourself

4845
03:15:29.177 --> 03:15:30.706
so you hear it and you can look over a bit,

4846
03:15:30.706 --> 03:15:32.411
but there's fog filled the chamber,

4847
03:15:32.411 --> 03:15:35.551
Yasha's being attacked by feral Caleb. It's a little nuts.

4848
03:15:35.551 --> 03:15:38.484
TALIESIN: I hate to burn something fun so early on,

4849
03:15:38.484 --> 03:15:40.234
but fuck it.

4850
03:15:40.234 --> 03:15:44.150
I'm going to cast Spirit Guardians with my action, then.

4851
03:15:44.150 --> 03:15:44.983
MATT: Okay.

4852
03:15:47.538 --> 03:15:49.279
Describe your spiritual guardian.

4853
03:15:49.279 --> 03:15:52.681
MATT: So the crystal begins to pulse and glow

4854
03:15:52.681 --> 03:15:54.997
and out of just the tiny bit of moss

4855
03:15:54.997 --> 03:15:59.881
that's on the top, a whole bunch of ethereal dragonflies

4856
03:15:59.881 --> 03:16:04.123
and little forest ephemera creatures

4857
03:16:04.123 --> 03:16:07.348
start flying around very quickly as a swarm,

4858
03:16:07.348 --> 03:16:09.867
15 feet in every direction of me.

4859
03:16:09.867 --> 03:16:10.962
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah.

4860
03:16:10.962 --> 03:16:11.883
ASHLEY: That's very cool.

4861
03:16:11.883 --> 03:16:14.064
TALIESIN: So he immediately has to make a--

4862
03:16:14.064 --> 03:16:16.172
MATT: Well, at the top of his turn he takes damage, right?

4863
03:16:16.172 --> 03:16:17.005
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4864
03:16:19.684 --> 03:16:20.942
MATT: I think it's at the top of each creature's turn

4865
03:16:20.942 --> 03:16:23.929
if it's within a certain range, it takes damage, right?

4866
03:16:23.929 --> 03:16:26.445
MARISHA: Fucking bugs down here?
LIAM: It's in my mouth!

4867
03:16:28.279 --> 03:16:30.170
TALIESIN: Yeah. So yeah.

4868
03:16:30.170 --> 03:16:31.677
MATT: Okay, that finishes your turn?

4869
03:16:31.677 --> 03:16:33.136
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4870
03:16:33.136 --> 03:16:34.636
MATT: Fjord, you're up.

4871
03:16:35.590 --> 03:16:39.023
TRAVIS: I'm going to see crazy-ass Caleb

4872
03:16:39.023 --> 03:16:40.506
jump on Yasha's back,

4873
03:16:40.506 --> 03:16:44.689
I'm like: Yasha we got to find that glacier wall, run!

4874
03:16:44.689 --> 03:16:46.806
I'm going to take off running past Yasha

4875
03:16:46.806 --> 03:16:50.184
towards the direction in which I think the glacier wall is.

4876
03:16:50.184 --> 03:16:51.348
MATT: You're still currently grappled.

4877
03:16:51.348 --> 03:16:52.507
TRAVIS: Ah!

4878
03:16:52.507 --> 03:16:54.103
MATT: You have no movement.

4879
03:16:54.103 --> 03:16:56.450
TRAVIS: I'm going to try to--

4880
03:16:56.450 --> 03:16:58.378
♪ I'm going to use the Summer's Dance falchion ♪

4881
03:16:58.378 --> 03:17:00.347
♪ bonus action to Misty Step ♪

4882
03:17:00.347 --> 03:17:02.063
MATT: There you go.
MARISHA: Yes!

4883
03:17:03.138 --> 03:17:05.201
ASHLEY: Misty Step on that mess.

4884
03:17:05.201 --> 03:17:07.368
MATT: Appear out of its grasp.

4885
03:17:08.562 --> 03:17:11.687
TRAVIS: I will continue running towards <i>la portal.</i>

4886
03:17:11.687 --> 03:17:12.520
MATT: Okay.

4887
03:17:12.520 --> 03:17:15.889
You run over and there is no crystal wall on this side.

4888
03:17:15.889 --> 03:17:17.354
TRAVIS: What!

4889
03:17:17.354 --> 03:17:19.018
MATT: It's just a hallway that ends.

4890
03:17:19.018 --> 03:17:20.676
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) There's nothing there?

4891
03:17:20.676 --> 03:17:23.051
MATT: Yep.
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) Even when I put my hand out?

4892
03:17:23.051 --> 03:17:25.575
MATT: It's a hallway, it just comes to an end on that edge.

4893
03:17:25.575 --> 03:17:29.933
MARISHA: Go for the fucking dagger!
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) Do I come back this way?

4894
03:17:29.933 --> 03:17:31.068
MATT: It'll get you over there,

4895
03:17:31.068 --> 03:17:32.565
that's about as far as you can get on your turn.

4896
03:17:32.565 --> 03:17:33.792
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah.

4897
03:17:33.792 --> 03:17:34.905
MATT: You have your action.

4898
03:17:34.905 --> 03:17:36.469
TALIESIN: You can, you can move.

4899
03:17:36.469 --> 03:17:38.387
MATT: That was your movement and your bonus action,

4900
03:17:38.387 --> 03:17:40.704
so you have an action still if you want to.

4901
03:17:40.704 --> 03:17:45.332
TRAVIS: I will-- I could use my action to run further, huh?

4902
03:17:45.332 --> 03:17:48.368
SAM: In the real world, I'm over near there.

4903
03:17:48.368 --> 03:17:50.620
Am I seeing him in any of these mirrors?

4904
03:17:50.620 --> 03:17:51.937
MATT: No.
TRAVIS: You moved bad me,

4905
03:17:51.937 --> 03:17:52.995
and this is real me.

4906
03:17:52.995 --> 03:17:53.914
MATT: Oh, sorry, you're right.

4907
03:17:53.914 --> 03:17:58.537
TRAVIS: I will come running back about one more in,

4908
03:17:58.537 --> 03:17:59.483
right about there.

4909
03:17:59.483 --> 03:18:00.953
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: Then I'll just stay.

4910
03:18:00.953 --> 03:18:01.786
MATT: You got it.

4911
03:18:01.786 --> 03:18:03.669
That ends your turn, Fjord. Yasha, you're up.

4912
03:18:03.669 --> 03:18:04.773
ASHLEY: Okay, so--

4913
03:18:04.773 --> 03:18:07.540
MATT: You are now currently pincered between fucked up Fjord

4914
03:18:07.540 --> 03:18:09.152
and fucked up Caleb.

4915
03:18:09.152 --> 03:18:10.069
ASHLEY: Okay, so--

4916
03:18:11.704 --> 03:18:16.384
I'm going to take another attack at the bad Fjord.

4917
03:18:16.384 --> 03:18:17.793
MATT: You got it, roll an attack.

4918
03:18:17.793 --> 03:18:19.194
ASHLEY: Okay.

4919
03:18:19.194 --> 03:18:20.821
SAM: That's a broken down old Fjord.

4920
03:18:20.821 --> 03:18:22.704
ASHLEY: Oh no. No.

4921
03:18:23.559 --> 03:18:24.523
10.

4922
03:18:24.523 --> 03:18:26.044
MATT: 10 misses.

4923
03:18:26.044 --> 03:18:27.168
ASHLEY: 'Kay.

4924
03:18:27.168 --> 03:18:28.093
MATT: Don't forget you can go reckless

4925
03:18:28.093 --> 03:18:29.716
on your turn to get advantage on the attacks.

4926
03:18:29.716 --> 03:18:30.694
ASHLEY: Oh, that's right.

4927
03:18:30.694 --> 03:18:32.258
MATT: Keep that in mind, any turn you want, you can do that.

4928
03:18:32.258 --> 03:18:34.261
ASHLEY: Second attack.

4929
03:18:34.261 --> 03:18:36.615
It's cocked.

4930
03:18:36.615 --> 03:18:39.696
Oh, come on, it's the same thing.

4931
03:18:39.696 --> 03:18:40.978
11.

4932
03:18:40.978 --> 03:18:42.962
MATT: 11 misses.

4933
03:18:42.962 --> 03:18:44.205
The fact that you're being attacked

4934
03:18:44.205 --> 03:18:45.634
by your friends on both sides,

4935
03:18:45.634 --> 03:18:47.342
even in your fury, it's confusing to you

4936
03:18:47.342 --> 03:18:48.973
and in that moment of hesitation,

4937
03:18:48.973 --> 03:18:50.886
they're able to move swiftly out of your grasp

4938
03:18:50.886 --> 03:18:51.993
and Caleb is on your back,

4939
03:18:51.993 --> 03:18:54.291
you cannot seem to get out of that area.

4940
03:18:54.291 --> 03:18:55.307
So that finishes your turn.

4941
03:18:55.307 --> 03:18:57.392
ASHLEY: Okay, yeah, that finishes my fucking turn.

4942
03:18:57.392 --> 03:18:58.647
MATT: Just going to go ahead and turn here.

4943
03:18:58.647 --> 03:19:00.712
Then just going to bear down on you.

4944
03:19:00.712 --> 03:19:04.205
Two attacks against you, Yasha, from the Fjord.

4945
03:19:04.205 --> 03:19:09.205
That is going to be a 19 and a 14.

4946
03:19:09.290 --> 03:19:10.836
ASHLEY: 19 hits.

4947
03:19:10.836 --> 03:19:12.065
MATT: All right, so claw hits you,

4948
03:19:12.065 --> 03:19:13.329
you are now grappled by him as well.

4949
03:19:13.329 --> 03:19:15.485
You are double grappled.

4950
03:19:15.485 --> 03:19:19.701
You do take-- three, four,

4951
03:19:19.701 --> 03:19:21.484
eight points of piercing damage reduced to four.

4952
03:19:21.484 --> 03:19:22.643
ASHLEY: 'Kay.

4953
03:19:22.643 --> 03:19:24.004
MATT: The bite just manages to sink

4954
03:19:24.004 --> 03:19:26.370
into the back of your shoulder leather,

4955
03:19:26.370 --> 03:19:27.972
doesn't actually pierce your skin too much,

4956
03:19:27.972 --> 03:19:29.269
not enough to affect you at all.

4957
03:19:29.269 --> 03:19:30.331
The Caleb that's on your back

4958
03:19:30.331 --> 03:19:33.221
is going to just attempt to bite into you twice.

4959
03:19:33.221 --> 03:19:35.278
That's going to be 11.

4960
03:19:35.278 --> 03:19:36.315
ASHLEY: Nope.

4961
03:19:36.315 --> 03:19:37.368
MATT: And 16?

4962
03:19:37.368 --> 03:19:38.568
ASHLEY: Yes.

4963
03:19:38.568 --> 03:19:40.309
MATT: All right, so 16 does get you.

4964
03:19:40.309 --> 03:19:43.175
You take 10 points of piercing damage reduced to five.

4965
03:19:43.175 --> 03:19:44.008
ASHLEY: 'Kay.

4966
03:19:44.008 --> 03:19:47.425
MATT: And seven points of acid damage,

4967
03:19:47.425 --> 03:19:49.338
as the bite begins to sizzle into you

4968
03:19:49.338 --> 03:19:51.419
and now both shoulders have been torn into,

4969
03:19:51.419 --> 03:19:52.708
the jaws clench down.

4970
03:19:52.708 --> 03:19:54.520
The Caleb is not relenting, there is--

4971
03:19:54.520 --> 03:19:57.933
its mouth is open and just jammed onto your shoulder

4972
03:19:57.933 --> 03:19:59.251
as part of the grapple.

4973
03:19:59.251 --> 03:20:01.436
It's burning into your shoulder.

4974
03:20:01.436 --> 03:20:02.982
ASHLEY: Okay.
MATT: All right, that ends--

4975
03:20:02.982 --> 03:20:04.840
Then this one against you, Caduceus.

4976
03:20:04.840 --> 03:20:05.863
It's going to take two attacks on you.

4977
03:20:05.863 --> 03:20:07.815
TALIESIN: Oh, first it has to roll a wisdom save.

4978
03:20:07.815 --> 03:20:09.674
MATT: Wisdom save.

4979
03:20:09.674 --> 03:20:11.386
Oh, that is a nine.

4980
03:20:11.386 --> 03:20:14.219
TALIESIN: Yep, nope, so he takes--

4981
03:20:17.215 --> 03:20:18.856
Oh, that's mean!

4982
03:20:20.892 --> 03:20:24.717
19 points of radiant damage.

4983
03:20:27.328 --> 03:20:29.605
MATT: It withdraws a bit, angrily,

4984
03:20:29.605 --> 03:20:31.881
and then just goes all in against you on this.

4985
03:20:31.881 --> 03:20:34.816
So now, let's roll it again, that's going to be--

4986
03:20:34.816 --> 03:20:36.440
14 to hit?
TALIESIN: That misses

4987
03:20:36.440 --> 03:20:38.348
and with that I'm going to use my reaction

4988
03:20:38.348 --> 03:20:39.889
to use my shield of retribution.

4989
03:20:39.889 --> 03:20:41.164
MATT: That you can.
TRAVIS: Yeah, get it!

4990
03:20:41.164 --> 03:20:42.507
MATT: Go for it.
ASHLEY: Yeah!

4991
03:20:42.507 --> 03:20:43.840
TALIESIN: So that's a--

4992
03:20:46.694 --> 03:20:49.155
You can use reaction to blast them with an arcane force.

4993
03:20:49.155 --> 03:20:51.322
They suffer 4d6.

4994
03:20:53.579 --> 03:20:57.137
There we are, 4d6, force damage.

4995
03:20:58.232 --> 03:21:00.273
They have to make a strength saving throw.

4996
03:21:00.273 --> 03:21:02.430
MATT: Strength saving throw.

4997
03:21:02.430 --> 03:21:03.791
It got a nine.

4998
03:21:03.791 --> 03:21:05.007
TALIESIN: No.

4999
03:21:05.007 --> 03:21:09.515
So that's five, six, seven, eight,

5000
03:21:09.515 --> 03:21:12.909
nine, 10, 11, 13, 14 points of force damage

5001
03:21:12.909 --> 03:21:15.500
and he's pushed 20 feet away from me.

5002
03:21:15.500 --> 03:21:18.287
MATT: Gets blasted back right away from you.

5003
03:21:18.287 --> 03:21:21.234
Into this mirror, this mirror shatters

5004
03:21:21.234 --> 03:21:25.762
into hundreds of pieces as he gets slammed into it,

5005
03:21:25.762 --> 03:21:27.095
it is destroyed.

5006
03:21:28.805 --> 03:21:31.192
He does not get a second attack on you,
because he is out of range.

5007
03:21:31.192 --> 03:21:33.153
TALIESIN: No, he doesn't!

5008
03:21:33.153 --> 03:21:34.207
MATT: All right.

5009
03:21:34.207 --> 03:21:35.997
That brings us back to you guys, what are you doing?

5010
03:21:35.997 --> 03:21:38.489
LIAM: In a panic, I'm not going in those mirrors,

5011
03:21:38.489 --> 03:21:39.747
that seems like a terrible idea,

5012
03:21:39.747 --> 03:21:41.952
but in a panic, getting to the-- am I at that gateway yet?

5013
03:21:41.952 --> 03:21:42.892
MATT: You have gotten to the gate now.

5014
03:21:42.892 --> 03:21:45.191
LIAM: In a split second, does anything look different here?

5015
03:21:45.191 --> 03:21:46.453
MATT: Nothing looks different.

5016
03:21:46.453 --> 03:21:48.996
You can still see the crystal, it's mostly opaque,

5017
03:21:48.996 --> 03:21:51.094
you can see there is a little bit of translucence to it,

5018
03:21:51.094 --> 03:21:52.688
where like, almost like you're looking through a very,

5019
03:21:52.688 --> 03:21:55.483
very white, dense ice.

5020
03:21:55.483 --> 03:21:56.773
LIAM: The grate?

5021
03:21:56.773 --> 03:21:59.784
MATT: The grate-- crystal, yeah, and there's the brass structure

5022
03:21:59.784 --> 03:22:01.184
it's built around, yeah.

5023
03:22:01.184 --> 03:22:04.147
LIAM: And brass and it's like egg, or oval, oval, oval?

5024
03:22:04.147 --> 03:22:05.738
MATT: Yeah, oval, oval.
LIAM: Five of them total?

5025
03:22:05.738 --> 03:22:07.770
I throw a Fire Bolt at the bottom right oval.

5026
03:22:07.770 --> 03:22:09.162
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: Yeah.

5027
03:22:09.162 --> 03:22:11.995
MATT: Go ahead and roll an attack.
LIAM: Okay.

5028
03:22:13.529 --> 03:22:15.987
TALIESIN: That's burnt. That was fun.

5029
03:22:15.987 --> 03:22:17.578
LIAM: That is a 17.

5030
03:22:17.578 --> 03:22:18.495
MATT: Okay.

5031
03:22:19.436 --> 03:22:23.066
It hits it, fire-- it just rings like--

5032
03:22:23.066 --> 03:22:24.781
LIAM: Okay, I just, I'm looking at it, and thinking,

5033
03:22:24.781 --> 03:22:26.103
and that's the end.

5034
03:22:26.103 --> 03:22:28.279
TRAVIS: Is it like a vase that's open at the top

5035
03:22:28.279 --> 03:22:29.391
or just an oval?

5036
03:22:29.391 --> 03:22:32.596
MATT: From what you can see it just looks like an oval.

5037
03:22:32.596 --> 03:22:34.278
MARISHA: (sighs)

5038
03:22:34.278 --> 03:22:36.769
SAM: Not knowing what to do, I'm just going to go up

5039
03:22:36.769 --> 03:22:39.377
and start smashing mirrors with my shortsword.

5040
03:22:39.377 --> 03:22:40.326
MATT: Okay.

5041
03:22:40.326 --> 03:22:42.064
(shattering)

5042
03:22:42.064 --> 03:22:44.705
So we'll say, this round, you get to shatter one mirror.

5043
03:22:44.705 --> 03:22:45.652
SAM: Great.

5044
03:22:45.652 --> 03:22:47.338
MATT: It's not too hard to do.

5045
03:22:47.338 --> 03:22:48.171
All right.

5046
03:22:49.466 --> 03:22:51.742
Beauregard, anything?

5047
03:22:51.742 --> 03:22:53.303
Jester, anything?

5048
03:22:53.303 --> 03:22:56.039
MARISHA: Did anyone keep any of those hearts?

5049
03:22:56.039 --> 03:22:56.872
SAM: Hearts?

5050
03:22:56.872 --> 03:22:58.193
MARISHA: Zombie hearts?

5051
03:22:58.193 --> 03:23:01.424
TALIESIN: I have some diamonds and some purple horseshoes.

5052
03:23:01.424 --> 03:23:02.783
MARISHA: What's that?

5053
03:23:02.783 --> 03:23:05.366
TALIESIN: I have some blue diamonds and some purple horseshoes,

5054
03:23:05.366 --> 03:23:06.283
but no hearts.

5055
03:23:06.283 --> 03:23:07.823
MARISHA: No hearts?
TALIESIN: No.

5056
03:23:07.823 --> 03:23:10.281
Nothing. Bad joke. Never mind.

5057
03:23:10.281 --> 03:23:12.522
TRAVIS: I'm asking--
MARISHA: What else do we do?

5058
03:23:14.229 --> 03:23:15.370
TRAVIS: Should we go over--

5059
03:23:15.370 --> 03:23:18.688
have we touched the blue glacial thing?

5060
03:23:18.688 --> 03:23:21.360
We haven't right?
MARISHA: Yeah, I don't think so.

5061
03:23:21.360 --> 03:23:23.261
I'll head to the blue glacial thing, sure.

5062
03:23:23.261 --> 03:23:24.677
Which is separate.

5063
03:23:24.677 --> 03:23:25.859
MATT: As a rogue, you can get there--

5064
03:23:25.859 --> 03:23:26.968
as a monk you can get there

5065
03:23:26.968 --> 03:23:30.102
pretty quickly with your action, yep.

5066
03:23:30.102 --> 03:23:31.185
MARISHA: I touch it.

5067
03:23:32.878 --> 03:23:33.921
MATT: It's a barrier.

5068
03:23:33.921 --> 03:23:35.484
TRAVIS: Does it feel cold?

5069
03:23:35.484 --> 03:23:37.141
MATT: Feels as cold as the rest of the room does.

5070
03:23:37.141 --> 03:23:38.656
Nothing-- you don't know.

5071
03:23:38.656 --> 03:23:39.962
TRAVIS: The dagger's not in this room,

5072
03:23:39.962 --> 03:23:41.449
it's in the mirror room, right?

5073
03:23:41.449 --> 03:23:42.833
MARISHA: Yeah.

5074
03:23:42.833 --> 03:23:44.768
TALIESIN: It's-- I think it's on the wall

5075
03:23:44.768 --> 03:23:46.152
in our mirror room, right now.

5076
03:23:46.152 --> 03:23:47.457
TRAVIS: In ours?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

5077
03:23:47.457 --> 03:23:49.723
MARISHA: Is there any like, anything--

5078
03:23:49.723 --> 03:23:51.959
can I see through this glacial wall?

5079
03:23:51.959 --> 03:23:53.158
MATT: Make a perception check.

5080
03:23:53.158 --> 03:23:55.782
I'll allow you to do that and that's the end of your turn.

5081
03:23:55.782 --> 03:23:58.824
Try and peer through it.
MARISHA: Don't fuck this up for once.

5082
03:23:58.824 --> 03:23:59.914
16, 16.

5083
03:23:59.914 --> 03:24:01.129
MATT: 16?

5084
03:24:01.129 --> 03:24:03.872
You glance through and it's hard to see through

5085
03:24:03.872 --> 03:24:06.375
but you see a shape beyond it.

5086
03:24:06.375 --> 03:24:08.827
Like five feet beyond this barrier.

5087
03:24:08.827 --> 03:24:11.634
It looks, from what you can tell-- not much--

5088
03:24:11.634 --> 03:24:13.288
it looks vaguely humanoid.

5089
03:24:13.288 --> 03:24:15.279
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

5090
03:24:15.279 --> 03:24:17.547
Shape beyond the glacier, okay.

5091
03:24:17.547 --> 03:24:19.130
MATT: Jester, anything?

5092
03:24:20.014 --> 03:24:22.702
TRAVIS: I got three dots, five, four,

5093
03:24:22.702 --> 03:24:25.892
three, two, they disappeared.

5094
03:24:25.892 --> 03:24:27.579
Um, she's going to walk over to the--

5095
03:24:27.579 --> 03:24:32.320
can she walk over to the gold oval thing

5096
03:24:32.320 --> 03:24:34.845
and like grab it and see if it does anything?

5097
03:24:34.845 --> 03:24:36.329
MATT: Okay, she holds it.

5098
03:24:36.329 --> 03:24:37.817
TRAVIS: Doesn't move, doesn't do shit?

5099
03:24:37.817 --> 03:24:39.058
MATT: Doesn't move, no.
TRAVIS: Okay.

5100
03:24:39.058 --> 03:24:40.789
MATT: Okay.

5101
03:24:40.789 --> 03:24:42.295
Top of the round, Caduceus, what are you doing?

5102
03:24:42.295 --> 03:24:45.795
TALIESIN: What action is it to grab the--

5103
03:24:48.667 --> 03:24:49.933
MATT: Looking over to it, it's--

5104
03:24:49.933 --> 03:24:51.738
I mean, it's jammed in there.

5105
03:24:51.738 --> 03:24:53.532
It'd probably be an action to try and pull it out,

5106
03:24:53.532 --> 03:24:56.075
because it's pretty dug in there.

5107
03:24:56.075 --> 03:24:57.652
TALIESIN: All right I'm going to pull it out.

5108
03:24:57.652 --> 03:24:58.485
MATT: Okay you walk over and grab.

5109
03:24:58.485 --> 03:24:59.744
Go ahead and make a strength check for me.

5110
03:24:59.744 --> 03:25:00.577
TALIESIN: Boo.

5111
03:25:04.112 --> 03:25:04.945
Strength check?

5112
03:25:04.945 --> 03:25:06.501
That's a five.
MATT: Five.

5113
03:25:06.501 --> 03:25:07.984
(grunting)

5114
03:25:07.984 --> 03:25:11.613
Not quite able to pull it from the wall part

5115
03:25:11.613 --> 03:25:12.712
that it's built into.

5116
03:25:12.712 --> 03:25:16.681
TALIESIN: Okay, okay, then just-- if it's not coming out,

5117
03:25:16.681 --> 03:25:19.981
then I'm going to just get--

5118
03:25:21.976 --> 03:25:23.370
When they enter my field

5119
03:25:23.370 --> 03:25:25.650
they have to roll again as well, right?

5120
03:25:25.650 --> 03:25:27.118
MATT: When they enter it or start in it.

5121
03:25:27.118 --> 03:25:28.082
TALIESIN: Okay.

5122
03:25:28.082 --> 03:25:32.940
So I'll just-- I'll stay here, take another look around

5123
03:25:32.940 --> 03:25:35.940
and wait to have another attempt to--

5124
03:25:37.077 --> 03:25:38.086
No, let's do some stuff.

5125
03:25:38.086 --> 03:25:41.105
I'm going to run over there

5126
03:25:41.105 --> 03:25:44.386
and see if I can just get both of those jerks within--

5127
03:25:44.386 --> 03:25:45.519
MATT: Is it a 15 foot radius?

5128
03:25:45.519 --> 03:25:47.018
TALIESIN: It's a 15 foot radius.

5129
03:25:47.018 --> 03:25:49.909
MATT: If you get there you can get them both in.

5130
03:25:49.909 --> 03:25:51.056
TALIESIN: How you both doing?

5131
03:25:51.056 --> 03:25:52.857
I'm-- yeah, so--

5132
03:25:52.857 --> 03:25:55.170
MATT: Caduceus like saunters up through the fog and mist

5133
03:25:55.170 --> 03:25:58.062
and you see this swarm of little like

5134
03:25:58.062 --> 03:26:01.332
light green lights just whipping around

5135
03:26:01.332 --> 03:26:03.583
and as you get closer you hear the--

5136
03:26:03.583 --> 03:26:04.632
the sound of them flying

5137
03:26:04.632 --> 03:26:08.322
and beginning to assail both of these imposter creatures.

5138
03:26:08.322 --> 03:26:09.641
TALIESIN: I found a thing back there.

5139
03:26:09.641 --> 03:26:10.780
ASHLEY: Oh. Hi.
TALIESIN: Hi.

5140
03:26:10.780 --> 03:26:12.841
TRAVIS: I do have a text request from Jester,

5141
03:26:12.841 --> 03:26:14.363
she wanted to see if she could use Sacred Flame

5142
03:26:14.363 --> 03:26:15.605
on the glacier wall.

5143
03:26:15.605 --> 03:26:16.446
MATT: Sure.

5144
03:26:16.446 --> 03:26:18.890
LIAM: It's not on your side, I thought?

5145
03:26:18.890 --> 03:26:20.290
MATT: No, on their side it is.

5146
03:26:20.290 --> 03:26:21.690
On Jester's side it is.

5147
03:26:21.690 --> 03:26:22.999
Jester's with you guys, she didn't make it through.

5148
03:26:22.999 --> 03:26:25.572
LIAM: Oh, she didn't make it through, that's right.

5149
03:26:25.572 --> 03:26:27.617
MATT: The flame bursts across the outside, no effect.

5150
03:26:27.617 --> 03:26:28.833
TRAVIS: Okay.

5151
03:26:28.833 --> 03:26:30.333
MATT: Fjord, you're up.

5152
03:26:31.299 --> 03:26:34.181
TRAVIS: I will go up and take a swipe at the Caleb

5153
03:26:34.181 --> 03:26:35.395
on the back of Yasha.

5154
03:26:35.395 --> 03:26:36.753
MATT: All right. Do you come up from an angle

5155
03:26:36.753 --> 03:26:38.086
or from behind it?

5156
03:26:38.086 --> 03:26:40.338
TRAVIS: Yeah, from behind. That'd be great.

5157
03:26:40.338 --> 03:26:42.412
Does that give me advantage or anything?
MATT: It does.

5158
03:26:42.412 --> 03:26:45.055
TRAVIS: Okay. Summer's Dance falchion.

5159
03:26:45.055 --> 03:26:46.947
That is a 23 to hit.

5160
03:26:46.947 --> 03:26:49.436
MATT: 23 to hit, all righty.

5161
03:26:49.436 --> 03:26:53.000
TRAVIS: That's eight points of slashing damage.

5162
03:26:53.000 --> 03:26:56.667
MATT: Eight points of slashing damage, all righty.

5163
03:26:57.913 --> 03:26:58.746
You got it.

5164
03:26:58.746 --> 03:27:01.079
TRAVIS: Then another, same target.

5165
03:27:02.655 --> 03:27:05.361
19 points-- or 19 to hit, sorry.

5166
03:27:05.361 --> 03:27:06.611
MATT: 19 hits, yep.

5167
03:27:08.097 --> 03:27:12.230
TRAVIS: And 12 points of slashing damage.

5168
03:27:12.230 --> 03:27:13.473
MATT: 12 points of slashing damage.

5169
03:27:13.473 --> 03:27:14.518
You got it, all right, so,

5170
03:27:14.518 --> 03:27:19.517
you slash across one side, it still clutching onto Yasha.

5171
03:27:19.517 --> 03:27:21.352
The second strike you hit again,

5172
03:27:21.352 --> 03:27:22.500
this time it cuts through its back,

5173
03:27:22.500 --> 03:27:24.023
the coat opens up a bit,

5174
03:27:24.023 --> 03:27:25.748
you can see the red flesh underneath,

5175
03:27:25.748 --> 03:27:28.929
it's just bleeding through it and it looks over-- (growling)

5176
03:27:28.929 --> 03:27:33.237
As it hisses at you, its jaw distends and opens.

5177
03:27:33.237 --> 03:27:34.330
TRAVIS: Still holding onto Yasha?

5178
03:27:34.330 --> 03:27:35.163
MATT: Still holding onto Yasha.

5179
03:27:35.163 --> 03:27:36.829
That finish your turn?
TRAVIS: That does.

5180
03:27:36.829 --> 03:27:37.933
MATT: Yasha, your turn.

5181
03:27:37.933 --> 03:27:41.318
ASHLEY: Okay, so, since he's immediately attacking me

5182
03:27:41.318 --> 03:27:44.724
I'm going to try to take care of this guy on my back

5183
03:27:44.724 --> 03:27:46.209
who keeps chewing on my shoulder.

5184
03:27:46.209 --> 03:27:47.841
TRAVIS: Rear head butt? Whack!

5185
03:27:47.841 --> 03:27:49.216
ASHLEY: Yeah. Bop!

5186
03:27:52.550 --> 03:27:54.440
Gerd dermit!

5187
03:27:54.440 --> 03:27:56.991
LIAM: Reckless!
ASHLEY: Oh, reckless.

5188
03:27:56.991 --> 03:27:58.786
Let's give it a fucking go.

5189
03:27:58.786 --> 03:28:00.922
MATT: Gotta keep that in mind.
ASHLEY: Not much better.

5190
03:28:00.922 --> 03:28:02.751
15.
MATT: 15 does hit.

5191
03:28:02.751 --> 03:28:03.584
ASHLEY: Okay.

5192
03:28:06.794 --> 03:28:07.627
Okay.

5193
03:28:09.635 --> 03:28:11.965
Seven, eight, nine.

5194
03:28:11.965 --> 03:28:14.215
16 for the first hit.

5195
03:28:14.215 --> 03:28:15.676
MATT: This against the Caleb?

5196
03:28:15.676 --> 03:28:16.597
ASHLEY: Yeah.

5197
03:28:16.597 --> 03:28:17.430
MATT: All right, you got it.

5198
03:28:17.430 --> 03:28:20.452
So across him, like cut him off of your shoulder

5199
03:28:20.452 --> 03:28:21.990
and he pulls back a bit.

5200
03:28:21.990 --> 03:28:23.050
He's hurt.

5201
03:28:23.050 --> 03:28:23.883
ASHLEY: Okay.

5202
03:28:23.883 --> 03:28:25.439
Second attack.
MATT: Go for it.

5203
03:28:25.439 --> 03:28:26.541
TRAVIS: Is he still grappling her?

5204
03:28:26.541 --> 03:28:28.541
MATT: Still grappling, yeah.

5205
03:28:29.407 --> 03:28:30.737
ASHLEY: 20 total.

5206
03:28:30.737 --> 03:28:34.237
MATT: 20 hits, go ahead and roll damage again.

5207
03:28:36.654 --> 03:28:37.765
ASHLEY: 12 points of damage.

5208
03:28:37.765 --> 03:28:39.409
MATT: 12 points of damage, nice.

5209
03:28:39.409 --> 03:28:40.341
(groaning)

5210
03:28:40.341 --> 03:28:42.332
Like you cut off one of the arms,

5211
03:28:42.332 --> 03:28:43.587
and the wrist falls off,

5212
03:28:43.587 --> 03:28:45.720
and you can see as its wrist pulls away

5213
03:28:45.720 --> 03:28:47.068
and blood pools off your shoulder,

5214
03:28:47.068 --> 03:28:49.383
the limp hand of Caleb shrivels up

5215
03:28:49.383 --> 03:28:51.829
into this pale, elongated fingered hand

5216
03:28:51.829 --> 03:28:53.521
that falls off your shoulder.

5217
03:28:53.521 --> 03:28:55.146
Still clutching with the other hand

5218
03:28:55.146 --> 03:28:56.655
and the feet wrapped around you.

5219
03:28:56.655 --> 03:28:58.063
That ends your turn, Yasha?

5220
03:28:58.063 --> 03:28:59.938
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MATT: All right.

5221
03:28:59.938 --> 03:29:01.264
Top of the round.

5222
03:29:01.264 --> 03:29:04.211
Go ahead and roll damage for your spiritual guardians.

5223
03:29:04.211 --> 03:29:05.878
TALIESIN: Your saving throw?

5224
03:29:08.357 --> 03:29:09.700
MATT: Okay, they both succeed.

5225
03:29:09.700 --> 03:29:10.834
TALIESIN: So they take half, right?

5226
03:29:10.834 --> 03:29:11.693
MATT: Yes.

5227
03:29:11.693 --> 03:29:15.263
TALIESIN: That's 10 points reduced to five radiant damage.

5228
03:29:15.263 --> 03:29:17.816
MATT: Five radiant damage.

5229
03:29:17.816 --> 03:29:19.110
To each?
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

5230
03:29:19.110 --> 03:29:20.563
MATT: That's actually enough to finish them both.

5231
03:29:20.563 --> 03:29:21.404
TALIESIN: Yep.

5232
03:29:21.404 --> 03:29:23.135
MATT: They both have been hit a lot

5233
03:29:23.135 --> 03:29:24.333
and they're both on the cusp.

5234
03:29:24.333 --> 03:29:26.153
So you watch as Caduceus walks up,

5235
03:29:26.153 --> 03:29:28.175
they're both attacking, they both look forward,

5236
03:29:28.175 --> 03:29:31.207
and the swarm just starts piercing them

5237
03:29:31.207 --> 03:29:33.573
from all sides and they start screaming

5238
03:29:33.573 --> 03:29:34.853
and they enter their mouth

5239
03:29:34.853 --> 03:29:37.096
and you watch as they start burrowing out of the wounds

5240
03:29:37.096 --> 03:29:38.880
and they like shrivel on the inside.

5241
03:29:38.880 --> 03:29:42.052
These light worms and bugs

5242
03:29:42.052 --> 03:29:44.094
and dragonflies just emerging

5243
03:29:44.094 --> 03:29:46.286
as they crumple inward.

5244
03:29:46.286 --> 03:29:48.481
The illusion fading, leaving these shriveled,

5245
03:29:48.481 --> 03:29:49.979
gray bodies on the ground.

5246
03:29:49.979 --> 03:29:52.481
TALIESIN: Sadly more of this nonsense all around.

5247
03:29:52.481 --> 03:29:55.329
We should probably clear it out a little bit.

5248
03:29:55.329 --> 03:29:57.701
MATT: He's going to try and rush in.

5249
03:29:57.701 --> 03:29:59.292
TALIESIN: Ah, and he's in it!

5250
03:29:59.292 --> 03:30:01.084
MATT: He is.
TALIESIN: Make a save.

5251
03:30:01.084 --> 03:30:02.536
MATT: That's a failure.
TALIESIN: Do I have to re-roll damage?

5252
03:30:02.536 --> 03:30:05.920
MATT: Yeah, re-roll damage.
TALIESIN: All right.

5253
03:30:05.920 --> 03:30:07.984
That's pretty good.

5254
03:30:07.984 --> 03:30:09.025
16 radiant.

5255
03:30:09.025 --> 03:30:10.558
MATT: How do you want to do this?

5256
03:30:10.558 --> 03:30:13.098
(cheering)

5257
03:30:13.098 --> 03:30:14.765
TALIESIN: I just want to turn around as he comes up

5258
03:30:14.765 --> 03:30:16.156
and I just want to catch his skull

5259
03:30:16.156 --> 03:30:18.197
as it slowly gets consumed.

5260
03:30:18.197 --> 03:30:21.002
MATT: You just grab it and pull it in.

5261
03:30:21.002 --> 03:30:22.918
TALIESIN: Cheap copy. All right.

5262
03:30:22.918 --> 03:30:24.705
I found a thing over here, by the way,

5263
03:30:24.705 --> 03:30:25.914
we should go check that out.

5264
03:30:25.914 --> 03:30:27.115
TRAVIS: What thing?

5265
03:30:27.115 --> 03:30:29.359
TALIESIN: Come on.

5266
03:30:29.359 --> 03:30:31.997
TALIESIN: Bring them around to the knife that I found.

5267
03:30:31.997 --> 03:30:35.997
MATT: So you guys now, at the moment, take a breath.

5268
03:30:36.856 --> 03:30:38.117
The mist still sits in the chamber,

5269
03:30:38.117 --> 03:30:40.587
but you don't see any immediate danger.

5270
03:30:41.778 --> 03:30:43.487
Caduceus drags you on the side

5271
03:30:43.487 --> 03:30:45.205
and you come and see the dagger on the wall.

5272
03:30:45.205 --> 03:30:48.392
TALIESIN: Let's-- who's-- can you pull that out?

5273
03:30:48.392 --> 03:30:49.699
TRAVIS: (concerned yelling)

5274
03:30:49.699 --> 03:30:52.044
Does the handle got anything written on it or some shit?

5275
03:30:52.044 --> 03:30:54.000
TALIESIN: I've already tried to pull it.

5276
03:30:54.000 --> 03:30:55.426
TRAVIS: You did?
TALIESIN: I did.

5277
03:30:55.426 --> 03:30:57.492
ASHLEY: I try to pull it.
MATT: Make a strength check.

5278
03:30:57.492 --> 03:30:59.825
LIAM: Caleb is doing something simultaneously, but let that--

5279
03:30:59.825 --> 03:31:01.783
MATT: We'll let this happen.
LIAM: Yeah.

5280
03:31:03.964 --> 03:31:06.135
TRAVIS: You have advantage if you're raging.

5281
03:31:06.135 --> 03:31:07.859
MATT: She technically wouldn't be raging anymore.

5282
03:31:07.859 --> 03:31:12.393
ASHLEY: Okay, that was, uh, 18.

5283
03:31:12.393 --> 03:31:13.342
MATT: 18?

5284
03:31:13.342 --> 03:31:14.639
No issue.

5285
03:31:14.639 --> 03:31:16.846
SAM: Oh!
MATT: It's a beautiful dagger.

5286
03:31:16.846 --> 03:31:18.862
It's a pearl carved handle, small hilt,

5287
03:31:18.862 --> 03:31:21.319
and the blade itself looks almost like a Damascus steel.

5288
03:31:21.319 --> 03:31:24.873
The design on it has like these spiraling grooves.

5289
03:31:24.873 --> 03:31:28.288
It's like a stiletto, as opposed to like a bladed dagger.

5290
03:31:28.288 --> 03:31:29.579
TALIESIN: Interesting.

5291
03:31:29.579 --> 03:31:32.093
TRAVIS: Anything about the wall where it was jammed in?

5292
03:31:32.093 --> 03:31:33.426
MATT: You go ahead and inspect it

5293
03:31:33.426 --> 03:31:35.709
and you can see like a little pocket there.

5294
03:31:35.709 --> 03:31:36.809
You can go ahead and make an investigation check

5295
03:31:36.809 --> 03:31:38.211
if you want to.

5296
03:31:40.640 --> 03:31:42.049
TRAVIS: 14.
MATT: 14.

5297
03:31:42.049 --> 03:31:44.075
It wasn't just jammed into the wall,

5298
03:31:44.075 --> 03:31:46.893
you can see-- almost like

5299
03:31:46.893 --> 03:31:48.747
when you're putting a screw into a wall,

5300
03:31:48.747 --> 03:31:51.219
and there's a little plastic pocket that fits in there,

5301
03:31:51.219 --> 03:31:52.580
there is a little brass sheath

5302
03:31:52.580 --> 03:31:53.792
that is embedded in the wall

5303
03:31:53.792 --> 03:31:55.391
that it was screwed into.

5304
03:31:55.391 --> 03:31:57.009
TRAVIS: Just right there?
MATT: Yes.

5305
03:31:57.009 --> 03:31:58.720
TRAVIS: Was it to the right of a mirror?

5306
03:31:58.720 --> 03:32:00.007
MATT: It was a little bit away from a mirror,

5307
03:32:00.007 --> 03:32:01.391
yeah, like a foot away.

5308
03:32:01.391 --> 03:32:03.440
TRAVIS: Do you want to check and see if
there were any others like--

5309
03:32:03.440 --> 03:32:05.579
TALIESIN: I'm going to look at the mirror

5310
03:32:05.579 --> 03:32:07.149
we were right next to really quick.

5311
03:32:07.149 --> 03:32:10.121
MATT: Mm-hm?
TALIESIN: Tap it.

5312
03:32:10.121 --> 03:32:12.576
MATT: Your finger enters the mirror and passes through.

5313
03:32:12.576 --> 03:32:13.466
TALIESIN: I put my head out.

5314
03:32:13.466 --> 03:32:14.526
Hey, look at this!

5315
03:32:14.526 --> 03:32:16.454
All right, I'm going to be--

5316
03:32:16.454 --> 03:32:17.887
MATT: You guys hear Caduceus down the hall.

5317
03:32:17.887 --> 03:32:18.720
MARISHA: Ah!

5318
03:32:18.720 --> 03:32:20.325
MATT: Which while that's happening, what have you been doing?

5319
03:32:20.325 --> 03:32:22.883
LIAM: I-- Liam knows this wasn't going to work, but I,

5320
03:32:22.883 --> 03:32:24.853
panicking, he would totally have yelled at Beauregard

5321
03:32:24.853 --> 03:32:28.325
to get out of the way and put some phosphorous in his hand

5322
03:32:28.325 --> 03:32:30.236
and shoved a Wall of Fire

5323
03:32:30.236 --> 03:32:32.098
right into that door to try to go--

5324
03:32:32.098 --> 03:32:33.800
MARISHA: The icy chasm?

5325
03:32:33.800 --> 03:32:35.671
LIAM: Yes. The glacial wall.

5326
03:32:35.671 --> 03:32:37.088
MATT: The glacial wall?
LIAM: Yeah.

5327
03:32:37.088 --> 03:32:38.539
MATT: Okay.

5328
03:32:38.539 --> 03:32:40.675
MARISHA: Wait, there's people on the other side!

5329
03:32:40.675 --> 03:32:43.946
MATT: The wall of fire burns around it, consuming the sides,

5330
03:32:43.946 --> 03:32:45.764
burning and burning away.

5331
03:32:45.764 --> 03:32:46.940
LIAM: It doesn't go through, right?

5332
03:32:46.940 --> 03:32:48.186
MATT: Does not pass through, no.

5333
03:32:48.186 --> 03:32:49.336
LIAM: It's whatever.

5334
03:32:49.336 --> 03:32:50.700
ASHLEY: Do we notice anything in our room--

5335
03:32:50.700 --> 03:32:52.253
TRAVIS: Jester made a perception check

5336
03:32:52.253 --> 03:32:56.295
for anything else unusual in the room and 24 she said.

5337
03:32:56.295 --> 03:32:57.535
MATT: 24?

5338
03:32:57.535 --> 03:32:59.082
From Jester for looking around?

5339
03:32:59.082 --> 03:33:00.386
Glancing around the chamber--

5340
03:33:00.386 --> 03:33:02.029
TRAVIS: She said 19 if it's investigation.

5341
03:33:02.029 --> 03:33:03.620
MATT: Got ya, no.

5342
03:33:03.620 --> 03:33:06.686
Looking around the room,
you do a small perusing pass through,

5343
03:33:06.686 --> 03:33:09.856
just more mirrors, more reflective surfaces,

5344
03:33:11.123 --> 03:33:12.926
and I guess Jester would see Caduceus' head

5345
03:33:12.926 --> 03:33:14.945
popping out at this point as the Wall of Fire's burning.

5346
03:33:14.945 --> 03:33:16.557
TALIESIN: We're going to take a look around
in here, one second.

5347
03:33:16.557 --> 03:33:18.381
LIAM: Wait! Where are you?

5348
03:33:18.381 --> 03:33:20.451
TALIESIN: I didn't hear that, because I put my--

5349
03:33:20.451 --> 03:33:21.284
I just yelled and put my--

5350
03:33:21.284 --> 03:33:22.436
MATT: Both you guys watch

5351
03:33:22.436 --> 03:33:24.270
Caduceus' head vanish into the mirror.

5352
03:33:24.270 --> 03:33:26.055
TALIESIN: There we go, we got a live one.

5353
03:33:26.055 --> 03:33:28.805
We can check around really quick in here.

5354
03:33:28.805 --> 03:33:30.746
TRAVIS: Yeah, do you want to put the dagger back in

5355
03:33:30.746 --> 03:33:33.754
so we don't get lost in this fucking hall of mirrors?

5356
03:33:34.996 --> 03:33:37.062
ASHLEY: No?
TALIESIN: I don't know.

5357
03:33:37.062 --> 03:33:38.536
Might reset the whole thing.

5358
03:33:38.536 --> 03:33:40.487
TRAVIS: How 'bout I stand here, y'all check it out.

5359
03:33:40.487 --> 03:33:41.996
TALIESIN: That's fair.
ASHLEY: Okay.

5360
03:33:41.996 --> 03:33:44.632
TRAVIS: If I scream, come running.

5361
03:33:44.632 --> 03:33:46.140
TALIESIN: We're going to do a--

5362
03:33:46.140 --> 03:33:47.768
TRAVIS: It'll be a manly scream.

5363
03:33:47.768 --> 03:33:49.864
Like, (low) "Aah!" instead of like, (high) "Eh!"

5364
03:33:49.864 --> 03:33:51.306
TALIESIN: Yeah, just follow around

5365
03:33:51.306 --> 03:33:52.846
and we're going to do a Marco Polo

5366
03:33:52.846 --> 03:33:54.474
just to keep in contact with people.

5367
03:33:54.474 --> 03:33:56.644
MATT: Okay, so you guys do a pass around.

5368
03:33:56.644 --> 03:34:00.101
TALIESIN: Just see if there's any other stuff.
Anything else weird.

5369
03:34:00.101 --> 03:34:03.810
MATT: Okay, you guys both make a perception check then.

5370
03:34:03.810 --> 03:34:06.960
TALIESIN: Come on, roll like a, no no no, 16.

5371
03:34:06.960 --> 03:34:08.266
MATT: 16, okay.
ASHLEY: 15.

5372
03:34:08.266 --> 03:34:09.182
MATT: 15, okay.

5373
03:34:09.182 --> 03:34:12.209
You guys do a fairly thorough pass around these chambers

5374
03:34:12.209 --> 03:34:14.242
and beyond the mirrored walls

5375
03:34:14.242 --> 03:34:16.922
it's a pretty direct replica of the chamber you were in,

5376
03:34:16.922 --> 03:34:19.505
except for the low fog that hangs everywhere.

5377
03:34:20.388 --> 03:34:21.729
TALIESIN: Nothing fancy?
MATT: Nothing fancy.

5378
03:34:21.729 --> 03:34:24.329
The dagger is the only real thing that seemed different

5379
03:34:24.329 --> 03:34:25.170
and to catch your eye.

5380
03:34:25.170 --> 03:34:26.245
ASHLEY: Are there slots and--?

5381
03:34:26.245 --> 03:34:28.203
TRAVIS: Jester said that she would've followed

5382
03:34:28.203 --> 03:34:30.659
Caduceus' head and try and go through that mirror.

5383
03:34:30.659 --> 03:34:32.660
MATT: (thud) Hits the mirror.

5384
03:34:32.660 --> 03:34:34.726
TALIESIN: I'm going to hold the dagger--
MARISHA: One-way mirror!

5385
03:34:34.726 --> 03:34:36.584
LIAM: (as Jester) You guys!
TALIESIN: --and you guys go in first.

5386
03:34:36.584 --> 03:34:38.117
TRAVIS: She cries a little bit out of frustration.

5387
03:34:38.117 --> 03:34:39.625
LIAM: (as Jester) I hurt my head!

5388
03:34:39.625 --> 03:34:42.672
MATT: Little smear on it from her forehead impact.

5389
03:34:42.672 --> 03:34:45.501
TALIESIN: Fjord, actually, why don't you try
and go through the mirror first.

5390
03:34:45.501 --> 03:34:47.766
TRAVIS: What, the one you just stuck your head through?

5391
03:34:47.766 --> 03:34:51.507
TALIESIN: Yeah, I mean, I've got the dagger right now, so.

5392
03:34:51.507 --> 03:34:52.829
TRAVIS: What'd you do, just stick your head through?

5393
03:34:52.829 --> 03:34:53.662
TALIESIN: Yeah.

5394
03:34:53.662 --> 03:34:56.383
MATT: (whoosh) Your head passes through out the other side.

5395
03:34:56.383 --> 03:34:58.491
You see Jester going like, "Ah."

5396
03:34:58.491 --> 03:35:01.724
TRAVIS: Hey.
MATT: "Hello?"

5397
03:35:01.724 --> 03:35:02.980
TRAVIS: Gimme your hand.

5398
03:35:02.980 --> 03:35:04.803
(whooshing)

5399
03:35:04.803 --> 03:35:06.672
MATT: You pull her into the chamber

5400
03:35:06.672 --> 03:35:08.359
you guys have been waiting in.

5401
03:35:08.359 --> 03:35:10.511
TRAVIS: Oh, I figured it out!

5402
03:35:10.511 --> 03:35:11.344
Hold on!

5403
03:35:13.025 --> 03:35:13.858
Oh no!

5404
03:35:13.858 --> 03:35:15.468
We're dying in here!
Help!

5405
03:35:15.468 --> 03:35:16.862
Help, come quick!

5406
03:35:16.862 --> 03:35:19.560
TRAVIS: (screaming)
LIAM: What?! Where are you?!

5407
03:35:19.560 --> 03:35:20.751
SAM: Oh no!
MATT: Fjord, as you do that,

5408
03:35:20.751 --> 03:35:21.584
you peek out,

5409
03:35:21.584 --> 03:35:22.726
and all you can see in the far corner,

5410
03:35:22.726 --> 03:35:25.126
there's just a raging inferno in the far edge.

5411
03:35:25.126 --> 03:35:26.525
TRAVIS: Oh, shit!

5412
03:35:26.525 --> 03:35:28.404
TALIESIN: I don't know if this is the way to do things.

5413
03:35:28.404 --> 03:35:30.696
TRAVIS: Hey, just humor me for a goddamn second.

5414
03:35:30.696 --> 03:35:33.092
LIAM: If he sees it doesn't do anything to the glacier,

5415
03:35:33.092 --> 03:35:34.162
he'll drop it.

5416
03:35:34.162 --> 03:35:36.796
MATT: Okay, then now it-- and you hear Fjord yelling.

5417
03:35:36.796 --> 03:35:37.904
MARISHA: Oh god!

5418
03:35:37.904 --> 03:35:39.829
SAM: Oh, we got to go help our friend!

5419
03:35:39.829 --> 03:35:42.949
MARISHA: We gotta go!
LIAM: I heard them from over there! Let's go!

5420
03:35:42.949 --> 03:35:45.081
TRAVIS: I stick just one hand through the mirror.

5421
03:35:45.081 --> 03:35:45.914
MATT: Okay.

5422
03:35:45.914 --> 03:35:47.557
You see Fjord's hand emerge from the mirror.

5423
03:35:47.557 --> 03:35:48.960
MARISHA: I'd probably make it there first.

5424
03:35:48.960 --> 03:35:50.035
MATT: All right. Beau, you take it?

5425
03:35:50.035 --> 03:35:51.726
(whooshing)
MARISHA: (screaming)

5426
03:35:51.726 --> 03:35:52.570
LIAM: Boosh!

5427
03:35:52.570 --> 03:35:56.913
MATT: Both Nott and Caleb (thud) into the mirror.

5428
03:35:56.913 --> 03:35:58.249
SAM: They're gone! Let them go!

5429
03:35:58.249 --> 03:36:00.493
ASHLEY: Hold on, we want to bring them in here?

5430
03:36:00.493 --> 03:36:02.601
TALIESIN: Are we pulling everybody in?

5431
03:36:02.601 --> 03:36:03.634
LIAM: It's just you and me now, Nott.

5432
03:36:03.634 --> 03:36:05.418
SAM: We'll create a new civilization.

5433
03:36:05.418 --> 03:36:06.251
TALIESIN: Hold on.

5434
03:36:06.251 --> 03:36:08.351
MARISHA: Who's not a person? Who's not a real person?

5435
03:36:08.351 --> 03:36:10.234
TALIESIN: I'm going to put my head through.

5436
03:36:10.234 --> 03:36:13.608
TRAVIS: You don't know when to smile
and you got terrible joke delivery.

5437
03:36:13.608 --> 03:36:14.834
MARISHA: You know a lot about me.

5438
03:36:14.834 --> 03:36:19.279
TALIESIN: We're in a weird mirror reflection of this room.

5439
03:36:19.279 --> 03:36:20.526
I don't know what's going on.

5440
03:36:20.526 --> 03:36:22.552
Do you want to be over here or should we come over there?

5441
03:36:22.552 --> 03:36:24.771
LIAM: Okay, we need to-- did you just come out and say that?

5442
03:36:24.771 --> 03:36:26.214
TALIESIN: My head is popping out and saying that.

5443
03:36:26.214 --> 03:36:28.207
LIAM: Oh, jeez!
SAM: (yelling)

5444
03:36:28.207 --> 03:36:29.983
MARISHA: I poke my head back through and I say,

5445
03:36:29.983 --> 03:36:32.870
They're fucking assholes, there was a fucking false alarm!

5446
03:36:32.870 --> 03:36:34.937
TALIESIN: Of all the things that have happened to us

5447
03:36:34.937 --> 03:36:37.415
and this is what startles you, really?

5448
03:36:37.415 --> 03:36:38.467
I mean--?

5449
03:36:38.467 --> 03:36:41.264
SAM: You're like a cow person. It's very strange.

5450
03:36:41.264 --> 03:36:43.128
TRAVIS: I put my hand out at Nott's head level and do this.

5451
03:36:44.095 --> 03:36:46.285
I pull it back.

5452
03:36:46.285 --> 03:36:48.704
TALIESIN: Do you want to be over here or do you want to--?

5453
03:36:48.704 --> 03:36:51.249
SAM: Do you want us over there?
What's over there?

5454
03:36:51.249 --> 03:36:55.150
MARISHA: Hey, Caleb, Caleb, I saw shapes beyond

5455
03:36:55.150 --> 03:36:57.905
that glacier wall thingy.

5456
03:36:57.905 --> 03:36:58.996
LIAM: What kind of shapes?

5457
03:36:58.996 --> 03:37:00.007
MARISHA: Humanoid shapes.

5458
03:37:00.007 --> 03:37:01.499
I figured it was these guys over here.

5459
03:37:01.499 --> 03:37:04.998
What if I go over there to the glacier wall

5460
03:37:04.998 --> 03:37:08.383
and you try and go to approximately where the glacier wall

5461
03:37:08.383 --> 03:37:12.570
might be over here and maybe see if we can do a sign?

5462
03:37:12.570 --> 03:37:13.729
LIAM: Okay.

5463
03:37:13.729 --> 03:37:15.024
MARISHA: You have your globules, right?

5464
03:37:15.024 --> 03:37:16.061
LIAM: Sure.

5465
03:37:16.061 --> 03:37:17.269
MARISHA: Maybe I can see your globules

5466
03:37:17.269 --> 03:37:19.470
through the glacier wall if it's you.

5467
03:37:19.470 --> 03:37:22.307
TALIESIN: I'm going to lose my Spirit Guardians soon.

5468
03:37:22.307 --> 03:37:23.333
MATT: It's faded by this point.

5469
03:37:23.333 --> 03:37:24.693
TRAVIS: There's no glacier wall here.

5470
03:37:24.693 --> 03:37:25.771
LIAM: I also apparate--

5471
03:37:25.771 --> 03:37:27.164
MATT: There's no glacier wall on this side.

5472
03:37:27.164 --> 03:37:30.331
MARISHA: Well, fuck!
Never mind, my point is moot.

5473
03:37:30.331 --> 03:37:32.679
LIAM: I apparate Frumpkin.

5474
03:37:32.679 --> 03:37:34.104
Are you leaning out the mirror?

5475
03:37:34.104 --> 03:37:36.357
MARISHA: I'm coming back in now.

5476
03:37:36.357 --> 03:37:37.807
LIAM: I place the vulture on her shoulder and say,

5477
03:37:37.807 --> 03:37:41.040
Take my cat. I'm going to go over there.

5478
03:37:41.040 --> 03:37:42.424
MARISHA: To where?

5479
03:37:42.424 --> 03:37:43.636
Which side are we on?

5480
03:37:43.636 --> 03:37:44.843
I'm getting confused.

5481
03:37:44.843 --> 03:37:48.376
LIAM: Your leaning out into the normal half.

5482
03:37:48.376 --> 03:37:49.492
MARISHA: Right, okay.

5483
03:37:49.492 --> 03:37:51.419
So I'm taking it into the foggy half.

5484
03:37:51.419 --> 03:37:52.528
LIAM: Yeah. What happens?

5485
03:37:52.528 --> 03:37:54.069
Frumpkin goes in with her?

5486
03:37:54.069 --> 03:37:55.429
MATT: Yeah.

5487
03:37:55.429 --> 03:37:57.813
LIAM: Go to the spot!

5488
03:37:58.684 --> 03:38:00.258
I'm going to go to where--

5489
03:38:00.258 --> 03:38:01.235
to that cave.

5490
03:38:01.235 --> 03:38:03.266
TALIESIN: Don't break any of the mirrors,
I think that's bad.

5491
03:38:03.266 --> 03:38:05.727
MATT: So you're at the glacier wall again?
LIAM: Yes, I am.

5492
03:38:05.727 --> 03:38:09.521
I'm doing this and Dancing Lights start floating around me

5493
03:38:09.521 --> 03:38:11.575
in a circle.

5494
03:38:11.575 --> 03:38:12.893
Beauregard!

5495
03:38:12.893 --> 03:38:14.309
MARISHA: Do I see anything on my side?
MATT: You walk over

5496
03:38:14.309 --> 03:38:15.517
and it's just an empty hallway

5497
03:38:15.517 --> 03:38:16.645
that comes to an end.

5498
03:38:16.645 --> 03:38:18.032
This is an enclosed chamber.

5499
03:38:18.032 --> 03:38:19.416
The hallways where you enter

5500
03:38:19.416 --> 03:38:24.153
and that barrier is, it just ends.

5501
03:38:24.153 --> 03:38:26.794
This is like a fully enclosed mirrored chamber.

5502
03:38:26.794 --> 03:38:29.052
LIAM: But I'm going to go into Frumpkin vision here.

5503
03:38:29.052 --> 03:38:30.794
MATT: It does not work.

5504
03:38:30.794 --> 03:38:33.271
LIAM: Okay, that is useful.

5505
03:38:33.271 --> 03:38:34.400
That is useful.

5506
03:38:34.400 --> 03:38:35.385
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

5507
03:38:35.385 --> 03:38:37.888
SAM: Why don't you just come out?
I mean, what are you doing in there?

5508
03:38:37.888 --> 03:38:39.922
MARISHA: Nothing. We were just checking to see

5509
03:38:39.922 --> 03:38:41.768
if it was the same pocket chamber.

5510
03:38:41.768 --> 03:38:43.771
TALIESIN: Yeah.
SAM: It's not.

5511
03:38:43.771 --> 03:38:46.919
ASHLEY: There's nothing there at the end of that hallway?

5512
03:38:46.919 --> 03:38:47.936
TRAVIS: I'll come out and I'll drop a silver

5513
03:38:47.936 --> 03:38:50.963
in front of that mirror and walk over to the glacial wall.

5514
03:38:50.963 --> 03:38:52.437
Do we still see--?

5515
03:38:52.437 --> 03:38:54.340
Is there a shape or anything

5516
03:38:54.340 --> 03:38:56.729
if you're like right up on the glacial--?

5517
03:38:56.729 --> 03:38:58.218
MATT: Make a perception check.

5518
03:38:58.218 --> 03:39:01.086
TRAVIS: But that's not my strong suit.

5519
03:39:01.086 --> 03:39:02.009
18.

5520
03:39:02.009 --> 03:39:02.972
MATT: 18.

5521
03:39:02.972 --> 03:39:04.024
TALIESIN: Every time you say that tonight.

5522
03:39:04.024 --> 03:39:05.191
MATT: You get close and you peek through

5523
03:39:05.191 --> 03:39:06.600
and you can see the, that humanoid shape

5524
03:39:06.600 --> 03:39:08.918
that Beauregard was talking about.

5525
03:39:08.918 --> 03:39:10.219
It's pale.

5526
03:39:10.219 --> 03:39:13.884
It's all pale, but not like dull gray, slithery pale,

5527
03:39:13.884 --> 03:39:14.993
like the creatures you fought.

5528
03:39:14.993 --> 03:39:17.768
It looks similar to the statues you saw earlier.

5529
03:39:17.768 --> 03:39:20.239
Closer to the doorway that you saw

5530
03:39:20.239 --> 03:39:21.913
when you guys first arrived here.

5531
03:39:21.913 --> 03:39:23.274
You see what looks to be--

5532
03:39:23.274 --> 03:39:25.974
you can't make out much detail,
but you see an angelic

5533
03:39:25.974 --> 03:39:29.223
porcelain figure standing with the hands like this

5534
03:39:29.223 --> 03:39:30.695
and that's all that you can see.

5535
03:39:30.695 --> 03:39:33.011
TRAVIS: Static, still?
MATT: Static and still.

5536
03:39:33.011 --> 03:39:35.657
LIAM: That's the normal world, through the glacial wall?

5537
03:39:35.657 --> 03:39:37.492
MATT: Correct.

5538
03:39:37.492 --> 03:39:38.975
TALIESIN: So--

5539
03:39:38.975 --> 03:39:40.979
MARISHA: I'll tear down each of these little halls

5540
03:39:40.979 --> 03:39:44.964
in the smoky realm, just into the walls

5541
03:39:44.964 --> 03:39:46.633
and make sure there's no hidden--

5542
03:39:46.633 --> 03:39:47.878
MATT: Okay, make an investigation check.

5543
03:39:47.878 --> 03:39:50.851
MARISHA: Okay.
MATT: Are you going to help out?

5544
03:39:50.851 --> 03:39:52.415
TRAVIS: Is the wall cold?

5545
03:39:52.415 --> 03:39:54.395
Is it ice or crystal, is it cold?

5546
03:39:54.395 --> 03:39:55.864
MATT: It's as cold as anything else in the room here,

5547
03:39:55.864 --> 03:39:57.410
it's not like a frozen ice.

5548
03:39:57.410 --> 03:40:02.085
It resembles that, but it also has a quartz-like feel to it.

5549
03:40:02.085 --> 03:40:06.918
ASHLEY: I just want to feel where the glacier wall would be.

5550
03:40:07.858 --> 03:40:08.691
MATT: Okay.

5551
03:40:08.691 --> 03:40:10.491
ASHLEY: On the other side.

5552
03:40:10.491 --> 03:40:11.565
MATT: So you make an investigation check

5553
03:40:11.565 --> 03:40:12.622
and you make one as well.

5554
03:40:12.622 --> 03:40:14.963
TRAVIS: Yeah, make sure that's
actually just a dead end hallway.

5555
03:40:14.963 --> 03:40:17.673
TALIESIN: Holler if something tries to bite you.

5556
03:40:17.673 --> 03:40:18.681
MATT: So what'd you roll?

5557
03:40:18.681 --> 03:40:19.718
MARISHA: 11.

5558
03:40:19.718 --> 03:40:20.798
ASHLEY: 19.

5559
03:40:20.798 --> 03:40:23.170
TALIESIN: I'm standing with the dagger at the
mirror in case, poking my head out.

5560
03:40:23.170 --> 03:40:24.623
LIAM: In the mirror world?
TALIESIN: In the mirror world.

5561
03:40:24.623 --> 03:40:26.086
MARISHA: We got rid of that ability

5562
03:40:26.086 --> 03:40:28.577
where I can spend a ki point
to re-roll an investigation check?

5563
03:40:28.577 --> 03:40:30.891
MATT: We did, we just gave it as benefit.

5564
03:40:30.891 --> 03:40:32.437
It got too complicated.

5565
03:40:33.887 --> 03:40:36.475
So you and Beauregard together

5566
03:40:36.475 --> 03:40:38.091
go and inspect the space.

5567
03:40:38.091 --> 03:40:40.212
The temperature doesn't change,
the walls are pretty solid.

5568
03:40:40.212 --> 03:40:41.820
You feel like you did a pretty thorough job

5569
03:40:41.820 --> 03:40:44.331
of checking for anything strange or hidden,

5570
03:40:44.331 --> 03:40:46.253
but it's just a wall.

5571
03:40:46.253 --> 03:40:47.261
TRAVIS: While we're doing all this stuff,

5572
03:40:47.261 --> 03:40:50.285
can I take the falchion, the point of the sword,

5573
03:40:50.285 --> 03:40:53.365
and just try and tink into the glacial thing

5574
03:40:53.365 --> 03:40:54.860
just to see if it's crystal?

5575
03:40:54.860 --> 03:40:57.202
MATT: In the glacial wall?
(thudding) Solid.

5576
03:40:57.202 --> 03:41:00.096
LIAM: I'm going to start getting right up and touching

5577
03:41:00.096 --> 03:41:02.279
and examining these oval shapes.

5578
03:41:02.279 --> 03:41:03.962
MATT: Make an investigation check.
LIAM: Okay.

5579
03:41:03.962 --> 03:41:06.048
ASHLEY: I'm going to make my way back to the--

5580
03:41:06.048 --> 03:41:08.411
TALIESIN: I'm waiting until everybody--
I want to be the last person--

5581
03:41:08.411 --> 03:41:10.874
I want to ferret everybody out of here.

5582
03:41:10.874 --> 03:41:12.265
LIAM: 18.
MATT: 18?

5583
03:41:12.265 --> 03:41:14.407
You feel it and it's got smooth

5584
03:41:14.407 --> 03:41:16.810
striations on the outside, very, very fine.

5585
03:41:16.810 --> 03:41:19.191
Almost like guitar wire you would feel like.

5586
03:41:19.191 --> 03:41:20.024
LIAM: Tar wire?

5587
03:41:20.024 --> 03:41:21.532
MATT: Like guitar wire, it has that like

5588
03:41:21.532 --> 03:41:23.714
that texture to it, of very, very fine striations.

5589
03:41:23.714 --> 03:41:25.147
MARISHA: Guitar.
LIAM: Guitar?

5590
03:41:25.147 --> 03:41:26.413
MATT: Guitar wire, sorry.

5591
03:41:27.471 --> 03:41:28.931
You feel around the backside of it.

5592
03:41:28.931 --> 03:41:31.174
They're not fully pressed against the wall or embedded,

5593
03:41:31.174 --> 03:41:33.100
there's a slight gap on the back.

5594
03:41:33.100 --> 03:41:36.946
You feel the back side and it's hollow.

5595
03:41:36.946 --> 03:41:38.939
Like--
LIAM: I want to check all of them.

5596
03:41:38.939 --> 03:41:39.809
MATT: Okay.

5597
03:41:39.809 --> 03:41:42.084
It's too thin of a space for you to get your hand inside of,

5598
03:41:42.084 --> 03:41:44.019
but you can feel your fingers

5599
03:41:44.019 --> 03:41:46.851
around the back end of it, it's hollow on the inside of it.

5600
03:41:46.851 --> 03:41:49.229
LIAM: Does it turn, move, anything like that?

5601
03:41:49.229 --> 03:41:52.154
MATT: Doesn't seem to shift at all, no.

5602
03:41:52.154 --> 03:41:55.154
LIAM: How high-- so, how high are the two

5603
03:41:56.225 --> 03:41:57.830
that are above on the sides

5604
03:41:57.830 --> 03:41:59.464
and how high is the one at the top?

5605
03:41:59.464 --> 03:42:01.198
MATT: There's one about like stomach level

5606
03:42:01.198 --> 03:42:02.462
for you guys on this side.

5607
03:42:02.462 --> 03:42:03.425
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: On each end.

5608
03:42:03.425 --> 03:42:06.170
There's one that's about head level on each end

5609
03:42:06.170 --> 03:42:07.459
and there's one that's about

5610
03:42:07.459 --> 03:42:10.126
eight feet up that's on the top.

5611
03:42:11.530 --> 03:42:14.153
LIAM: I can probably reach the ones on the sides.

5612
03:42:14.153 --> 03:42:15.611
MATT: Yeah, the eight-foot one you can't quite reach.

5613
03:42:15.611 --> 03:42:16.444
LIAM: Right.

5614
03:42:17.748 --> 03:42:19.674
I want Caduceus' help over here.

5615
03:42:19.674 --> 03:42:21.287
TALIESIN: As soon as everybody is out of the room.

5616
03:42:21.287 --> 03:42:22.290
MARISHA: We make our way over there.

5617
03:42:22.290 --> 03:42:24.361
TALIESIN: I'm taking the dagger with me.

5618
03:42:24.361 --> 03:42:25.596
MATT: Okay.

5619
03:42:25.596 --> 03:42:26.965
You guys all go through the same mirror?

5620
03:42:26.965 --> 03:42:28.132
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

5621
03:42:29.397 --> 03:42:31.824
You all exit the chamber.

5622
03:42:31.824 --> 03:42:35.509
TALIESIN: I found this in there.

5623
03:42:35.509 --> 03:42:38.398
This was the-- so there was a--
seemed to be some sort of a--

5624
03:42:38.398 --> 03:42:40.027
MARISHA: Was that the dagger?

5625
03:42:40.027 --> 03:42:42.272
TALIESIN: It was-- yeah, it was stuck in the wall

5626
03:42:42.272 --> 03:42:44.659
and then we removed it, but it was like,

5627
03:42:44.659 --> 03:42:47.381
it was stuck on purpose

5628
03:42:47.381 --> 03:42:49.034
and I think it like opened--

5629
03:42:49.034 --> 03:42:50.315
MARISHA: Like a key.

5630
03:42:50.315 --> 03:42:52.556
TRAVIS: There's no receptacle for it in this world

5631
03:42:52.556 --> 03:42:53.997
where it was in the mirror world?

5632
03:42:53.997 --> 03:42:56.072
TALIESIN: Not that I saw, but I can double check.

5633
03:42:56.072 --> 03:42:57.394
MATT: You go back and check and it's just a straight wall.

5634
03:42:57.394 --> 03:42:58.321
ASHLEY: Is there anything in the door?

5635
03:42:58.321 --> 03:42:59.515
TRAVIS: Is there anything around the brass frame

5636
03:42:59.515 --> 03:43:00.528
that looks like that?

5637
03:43:00.528 --> 03:43:02.792
LIAM: I'm going to knock on one of the eggs.

5638
03:43:02.792 --> 03:43:04.598
MATT: (ringing)

5639
03:43:04.598 --> 03:43:06.232
LIAM: Bring that over here.

5640
03:43:06.232 --> 03:43:08.868
I'm grasping at straws here, but--

5641
03:43:08.868 --> 03:43:12.624
TALIESIN: I'm also going to--
yeah, I'm watching you do this.

5642
03:43:12.624 --> 03:43:13.791
LIAM: Poke that thing.

5643
03:43:13.791 --> 03:43:14.881
With your dagger.
TALIESIN: Me?

5644
03:43:14.881 --> 03:43:15.714
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

5645
03:43:16.981 --> 03:43:21.007
MATT: (thudding) It hits the metal.

5646
03:43:21.007 --> 03:43:23.713
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait.

5647
03:43:23.713 --> 03:43:24.796
Tap it again.

5648
03:43:25.796 --> 03:43:28.238
TALIESIN: (knock)
MATT: (ringing)

5649
03:43:29.620 --> 03:43:31.929
I tap it up a little higher, the next thing.

5650
03:43:31.929 --> 03:43:34.231
MATT: (higher-pitched ringing)

5651
03:43:34.231 --> 03:43:35.664
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.
MARISHA: I tap the other one.

5652
03:43:35.664 --> 03:43:37.172
MATT: (highest-pitch ringing)

5653
03:43:37.172 --> 03:43:39.485
Tap the other one.
MATT: (lower-pitched ringing)

5654
03:43:39.485 --> 03:43:43.119
Music.
(Travis singing)

5655
03:43:43.119 --> 03:43:46.806
ASHLEY: We were already hearing that.
TRAVIS: Assassin's Creed.

5656
03:43:46.806 --> 03:43:48.856
ASHLEY: May I, okay.

5657
03:43:48.856 --> 03:43:50.346
MARISHA: Yeah, we got to play a tune.

5658
03:43:50.346 --> 03:43:54.596
ASHLEY: Can I go up against the glacier,

5659
03:43:54.596 --> 03:43:56.296
put my hand on the glacier,

5660
03:43:56.296 --> 03:43:58.366
and see if I can hear anything again?

5661
03:43:58.366 --> 03:44:00.095
MATT: Sure, you put your ear up to it and listen,

5662
03:44:00.095 --> 03:44:02.095
make a perception check.

5663
03:44:05.547 --> 03:44:07.372
TALIESIN: I'm going to use sharp in here--

5664
03:44:07.372 --> 03:44:08.218
ASHLEY: 14.

5665
03:44:08.218 --> 03:44:09.993
MATT: 14? Nothing.

5666
03:44:13.025 --> 03:44:15.779
Do I see anything in the glacier?

5667
03:44:15.779 --> 03:44:17.083
MATT: From what other people have described,

5668
03:44:17.083 --> 03:44:20.409
the same thing, you see that strange porcelain shape.

5669
03:44:20.409 --> 03:44:22.944
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and use a chunk of mirror

5670
03:44:22.944 --> 03:44:25.457
to look inside one of the eggs that I can reach.

5671
03:44:25.457 --> 03:44:26.409
MATT: Okay.

5672
03:44:26.409 --> 03:44:27.550
Look inside.

5673
03:44:27.550 --> 03:44:28.749
It's hollow.

5674
03:44:28.749 --> 03:44:31.084
TALIESIN: There's nothing in there?
It just makes a tone?

5675
03:44:31.084 --> 03:44:32.753
ASHLEY: Should we try hitting them at the same time?

5676
03:44:32.753 --> 03:44:35.423
TRAVIS: Jester's saying we should try and play the song

5677
03:44:35.423 --> 03:44:39.647
that she heard radiating through the statue.

5678
03:44:41.541 --> 03:44:42.973
LIAM: Then she should do it.

5679
03:44:42.973 --> 03:44:45.280
TRAVIS: Yeah, can she try and duplicate?

5680
03:44:45.280 --> 03:44:47.378
Can she hit them and then try and duplicate the song?

5681
03:44:47.378 --> 03:44:49.637
MATT: Okay, she goes and finds the notes.

5682
03:44:49.637 --> 03:44:52.317
Once she hears the notes, she remembers back,

5683
03:44:52.317 --> 03:44:53.947
and with your help, Caleb, as well,

5684
03:44:53.947 --> 03:44:55.776
though mostly she's the one who heard it.

5685
03:44:55.776 --> 03:44:58.191
Actually you didn't hear it at all.
Yeah, even though you have your feat.

5686
03:44:58.191 --> 03:44:59.181
LIAM: I don't hear it.

5687
03:44:59.181 --> 03:45:00.031
MATT: Yeah, that's right.

5688
03:45:00.031 --> 03:45:02.354
So Jester goes around and eventually finds the--

5689
03:45:02.354 --> 03:45:05.611
(singing tones)

5690
03:45:05.611 --> 03:45:09.891
(singing tones)

5691
03:45:09.891 --> 03:45:12.122
(rumbling)
SAM: Oh!

5692
03:45:12.122 --> 03:45:14.964
It cracks down the center and shifts open.

5693
03:45:14.964 --> 03:45:18.105
Mist pours out from the interior

5694
03:45:18.105 --> 03:45:22.059
and about five feet beyond it, you can see another door.

5695
03:45:22.059 --> 03:45:25.984
This door is split in the center.

5696
03:45:25.984 --> 03:45:28.122
You can see a line where it divides

5697
03:45:28.122 --> 03:45:32.586
and you see the shape of a carved angel, wings open.

5698
03:45:32.586 --> 03:45:35.648
Its eyes are closed, or mostly closed,

5699
03:45:35.648 --> 03:45:36.959
you can see just a little bit,

5700
03:45:36.959 --> 03:45:38.501
the lids almost entirely closed.

5701
03:45:38.501 --> 03:45:40.336
The hands are both forward clutched like this

5702
03:45:40.336 --> 03:45:42.927
in the chest and its heads looking down standing there.

5703
03:45:42.927 --> 03:45:45.524
LIAM: Dagger in the hands.
TRAVIS: Yeah, wait.

5704
03:45:45.524 --> 03:45:46.553
Okay, yeah.

5705
03:45:46.553 --> 03:45:50.145
MARISHA: So I can see through the
glacier now from this room?

5706
03:45:50.145 --> 03:45:51.576
MATT: The glacier's open now.

5707
03:45:51.576 --> 03:45:54.423
TRAVIS: Let Yasha do it.
MARISHA: Oh.

5708
03:45:54.423 --> 03:45:56.338
MATT: The glacier wall opened up

5709
03:45:56.338 --> 03:45:57.796
once the music theme was played.

5710
03:45:57.796 --> 03:45:59.825
MARISHA: Oh, copy.

5711
03:45:59.825 --> 03:46:01.818
TRAVIS: Give her the dagger.
SAM: Yasha, take the dagger.

5712
03:46:01.818 --> 03:46:04.200
ASHLEY: What does me have anything to do with it?

5713
03:46:04.200 --> 03:46:06.185
SAM: This is your thing.

5714
03:46:06.185 --> 03:46:07.591
ASHLEY: What do you mean it's my thing?

5715
03:46:07.591 --> 03:46:09.042
SAM: I don't know, he wants to see you.

5716
03:46:09.042 --> 03:46:12.197
You should do the-- you should stab the thing in the heart.

5717
03:46:12.197 --> 03:46:14.486
LIAM: You should do it from 30 feet away.

5718
03:46:14.486 --> 03:46:16.958
SAM: Oh, we could do that too.
ASHLEY: Give it a try.

5719
03:46:16.958 --> 03:46:18.722
TALIESIN: We're not stabbing--

5720
03:46:18.722 --> 03:46:20.771
we're going to put it in the hands, right?

5721
03:46:20.771 --> 03:46:22.269
SAM: Oh, it's not going in?

5722
03:46:22.269 --> 03:46:23.623
ASHLEY: I mean I will do it, I--

5723
03:46:23.623 --> 03:46:25.760
TALIESIN: No, you're hurt too, let's not--

5724
03:46:25.760 --> 03:46:28.043
LIAM: Let's do it from a safe distance.

5725
03:46:28.043 --> 03:46:29.643
TALIESIN: Yeah, back up a bit.

5726
03:46:29.643 --> 03:46:32.029
SAM: All right, I'll Mage Hand and carry the dagger over

5727
03:46:32.029 --> 03:46:34.432
and place it in the angel's--

5728
03:46:34.432 --> 03:46:35.721
MATT: Like handle first into the hand?

5729
03:46:35.721 --> 03:46:36.792
SAM: I guess handle first,

5730
03:46:36.792 --> 03:46:38.848
but my instinct was to stab the thing in the heart,

5731
03:46:38.848 --> 03:46:40.288
but I've been overruled.

5732
03:46:40.288 --> 03:46:44.490
MATT: You place the handle and it doesn't fit.

5733
03:46:44.490 --> 03:46:47.958
SAM: I will flip it over and go in knife side.

5734
03:46:47.958 --> 03:46:52.008
MATT: It slips in and turns, like the grooves fit the space

5735
03:46:52.008 --> 03:46:55.392
as it slides in, as it goes right to the base of the dagger,

5736
03:46:55.392 --> 03:46:57.408
it stops,

5737
03:46:57.408 --> 03:47:00.316
and blood begins to run from the eyes of the angel

5738
03:47:00.316 --> 03:47:02.277
and the door splits from the center

5739
03:47:02.277 --> 03:47:05.953
and opens up from the inside out,

5740
03:47:05.953 --> 03:47:10.128
leading into the next chamber.

5741
03:47:10.128 --> 03:47:11.354
And that's where we'll pick up next week.

5742
03:47:11.354 --> 03:47:12.418
ASHLEY: No!
MARISHA: Aah!

5743
03:47:12.418 --> 03:47:14.011
MATT: It's almost 11!

5744
03:47:14.011 --> 03:47:15.736
It's almost 11.

5745
03:47:15.736 --> 03:47:17.590
TRAVIS: Good shit, man.

5746
03:47:17.590 --> 03:47:20.409
MATT: We haven't had a proper dungeon crawl in a long time!

5747
03:47:20.409 --> 03:47:22.089
This has been fun!

5748
03:47:22.089 --> 03:47:24.180
SAM: Super dungeon crawl.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

5749
03:47:24.180 --> 03:47:25.805
TRAVIS: So many of them.
MARISHA: So cool.

5750
03:47:25.805 --> 03:47:27.661
TALIESIN: I'm going to name my next ulcer after you.

5751
03:47:27.661 --> 03:47:29.439
TRAVIS: A finite number of mirrors we
could have come through, right?

5752
03:47:29.439 --> 03:47:31.660
Destroying them wouldn't have done anything.

5753
03:47:31.660 --> 03:47:33.882
TALIESIN: I'm of the opinion that destroying the mirrors

5754
03:47:33.882 --> 03:47:36.465
would have let more copies out.

5755
03:47:37.582 --> 03:47:39.016
That's just a theory.

5756
03:47:39.016 --> 03:47:40.355
TRAVIS: Doppelgangers?

5757
03:47:40.355 --> 03:47:41.438
TALIESIN: This is really pretty.

5758
03:47:41.438 --> 03:47:42.933
MATT: Something different.

5759
03:47:42.933 --> 03:47:45.298
Similar in some ways, but not quite doppelgangers.

5760
03:47:45.298 --> 03:47:47.130
It was an original design.

5761
03:47:47.130 --> 03:47:49.343
TRAVIS: Ooh, getting some OG shit.

5762
03:47:49.343 --> 03:47:51.166
LIAM: Influenced.
TALIESIN: This is so cool.

5763
03:47:51.166 --> 03:47:52.427
ASHLEY: Yeah, this is really cool.

5764
03:47:52.427 --> 03:47:55.117
TALIESIN: I am jelly, this is good.

5765
03:47:55.117 --> 03:47:57.765
SAM: We haven't seen that guy in a while, Obann.

5766
03:47:57.765 --> 03:47:59.594
TRAVIS: No, but his tracks led this way.

5767
03:47:59.594 --> 03:48:00.860
MATT: They did.
TALIESIN: We can follow him.

5768
03:48:00.860 --> 03:48:01.693
LIAM: Yeah.

5769
03:48:01.693 --> 03:48:02.890
MATT: Maybe next week, we'll see.

5770
03:48:02.890 --> 03:48:04.656
TRAVIS: And, when it was like this,

5771
03:48:04.656 --> 03:48:06.516
were the cheeks unstained or--?

5772
03:48:06.516 --> 03:48:07.899
MATT: Correct. It was clean,

5773
03:48:07.899 --> 03:48:09.199
and then once the dagger was placed in,

5774
03:48:09.199 --> 03:48:10.392
they began to bleed.

5775
03:48:10.392 --> 03:48:12.956
TRAVIS: Oh, shit, this is uncharted.
LIAM: So we have made it farther

5776
03:48:12.956 --> 03:48:14.036
than our friend, yeah.

5777
03:48:14.036 --> 03:48:18.228
TALIESIN: Or, it reset.
ASHLEY: Or, yeah, it could reset.

5778
03:48:18.228 --> 03:48:20.811
SAM: We'll give you the answers next time...

5779
03:48:20.811 --> 03:48:22.269
on Critical Role.

5780
03:48:22.269 --> 03:48:23.491
TALIESIN: All sorts of things can happen.

5781
03:48:23.491 --> 03:48:24.749
LIAM: Poker face!

5782
03:48:24.749 --> 03:48:25.965
MATT: Thank you guys for joining us

5783
03:48:25.965 --> 03:48:28.101
for this fun adventure.

5784
03:48:28.101 --> 03:48:29.793
We'll be back here next Thursday

5785
03:48:29.793 --> 03:48:32.062
to see what is beyond this door.

5786
03:48:32.062 --> 03:48:33.537
Until then, we love you very much,

5787
03:48:33.537 --> 03:48:35.505
and is it Thursday yet?

5788
03:48:35.505 --> 03:48:37.237
Good night!

5789
03:48:37.237 --> 03:48:41.878

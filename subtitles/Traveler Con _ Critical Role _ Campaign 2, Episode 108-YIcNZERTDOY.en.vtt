MATT: So, we have Labor Day coming up soon.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.530
And if those of you are looking to start a new campaign,

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.150
why not start it in Wildemount?

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.670
It's where we have our game,

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.650
and I wrote a book about it with some cool people.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.370
And you should start a campaign there.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.923
It has the Heroic Chronicle, which
helps you create character backstories

00:04:29.923 --> 00:04:31.968
that are already deeply ingrained

00:04:31.968 --> 00:04:35.550
in the lore, world, and cultures of Wildemount.

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.570
There are three new subclasses,

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.630
including 15 new magic spells based around Dunamancy.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.930
46 items, magical items for
your character sheet on D&amp;D Beyond.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.900
And you can bring over 40 dangerous monsters

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.040
into the encounter builder to help battle

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.630
against your party as they go through

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.220

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:36.420
LAURA: Yeah, it's a weird thing doing merchandise

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:37.793
in other countries; sometimes the merch

00:07:37.793 --> 00:07:40.210
is a little different, but that's kind of fun.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.400
The "Don't forget to love each other" shirt

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.583
is in the Australia shop now.

00:07:45.583 --> 00:07:46.416
What what!

00:07:46.416 --> 00:07:49.610
Which means it's now available in all the online shops.

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:51.730
And that is $10 from every shirt going

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:54.750
to OutRight Action International, always.

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:55.990
SAM: Crikey.

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:58.227
LAURA: And then, the last thing I want to talk about,

00:07:58.227 --> 00:08:01.960
is the fact that we've partnered with The Op on a puzzle,

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.800
which I don't even think you guys have seen yet.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:04.633
SAM and MARISHA: No.

00:08:04.633 --> 00:08:06.750
LAURA: But it's super, super duper cool.

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:09.730
It's featuring art of the Mighty Nein by Lauren Walsh.

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:11.560
It's available in the US shop now.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.350
It's coming soon in the other shops,

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:16.680
and it's also going to be available in retail stores,

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.790
like Target and Walmart and Amazon,

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:24.494
and anywhere that The Op sells puzzles.

00:08:24.494 --> 00:08:26.510
SAM: Do you have it?
TRAVIS: That's weird. That's real weird.

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:28.835
LAURA: I don't have it in my hand.

00:08:28.835 --> 00:08:31.876
ASHLEY: I want to see it!
LAURA: Go to our store and look

00:08:31.876 --> 00:08:33.276
and you'll see it.

00:08:33.276 --> 00:08:35.419
MARISHA: Where are they going to--
LAURA: And then I'll--

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:38.010
I'll send you guys a picture tonight.

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:39.738
MATT: Thank you, Laura.
LAURA: All right.

00:08:39.738 --> 00:08:41.915
MARISHA: Is it going to be next to like--
ASHLEY: How many pieces?

00:08:41.915 --> 00:08:43.262
LAURA: A thousand pieces!

00:08:43.262 --> 00:08:45.753
ASHLEY: Is it a thousand piece puzzle?!
LAURA: It's a thousand pieces!

00:08:45.753 --> 00:08:48.098
MARISHA: Yes!
ASHLEY: Those are the good ones.

00:08:48.098 --> 00:08:49.760
LAURA: They're little-- little pieces.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.780
SAM: Is there a chair in it?

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:53.970
LAURA: There's no chair, but it is difficult.

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:56.250
Like I-- it's a hard puzzle, I think.

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:58.783
LIAM: Did you do it?
LAURA: No, but I've seen the art

00:08:58.783 --> 00:09:01.170
and I know it's going to be a hard puzzle.

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.290
I've done puzzles.

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:05.070
So anyway, there's that.

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:06.334
MATT: Thank you, Laura.
LAURA: You're welcome.

00:09:06.334 --> 00:09:07.670
MATT: (laughs)

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:09.580
All right, I think that ends our announcements

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:11.240
for the evening.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:15.080
So let's go to jump into tonight's episode of...

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.196
Critical Role.

00:09:16.196 --> 00:09:17.343
LIAM: (screams)

MATT: And welcome back.
SAM: We forgot.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:56.660
MATT: Yeah, for once.

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:59.280
It was nice, I could just relax,

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.610
and calm and not have you all

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:02.916
shout at me last minute, look at that.

00:11:02.916 --> 00:11:04.701
It's the only time it'll happen.

00:11:04.701 --> 00:11:07.387
So last we left off,

00:11:07.387 --> 00:11:09.660
The Mighty Nein, after coming to Rumblecusp

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:12.440
prepare for Traveler Con,

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:17.313
dealt with the terrors that were the memory--

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.940
what's the word I'm looking for?

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:21.030
Fucked up, sure.

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:22.725
I was going to go for a
more interesting word, but I'll go with that.

00:11:22.725 --> 00:11:26.960
Memory fucked-up society of the village of Vo.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.100
The entity known as Vokodo,

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:31.200
that had existed within this mountain.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.250
You looked for information about,

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:35.080
discovered some of its history,

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:39.050
went and battled it in the base underneath the volcano,

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:42.290
and freed the people of this terror.

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:44.640
However, in doing so, you also restored their memories,

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:46.610
some of which were from the life before they came

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:48.750
to the island, and some they've made

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:49.583
since they've come here.

00:11:49.583 --> 00:11:52.080
And that village has now fractured,

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.840
many leaving to return to their previous lives,

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:56.500
while some have chosen to remain to live the new life

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.558
they've carved here on Rumblecusp.

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:00.780
As the week has gone on,

00:12:00.780 --> 00:12:02.350
you've begun to prepare yourselves

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:04.350
for the coming event of the Zenith,

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:07.040
which was the chosen date for Traveler Con.

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.490
And as more and more individuals arrive by boat,

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:13.760
you have well over a hundred plus individuals

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.573
that have arrived for this event.

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:19.220
They've all gathered for an evening celebration,

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:22.420
or as what we're now calling Traveler's Eve,

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:23.790
where there are parties,

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:26.330
and people are crafting wooden dicks,

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.400
and people are eating lots and lots

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:31.140
of Tyrannosaurus meat.

00:12:32.232 --> 00:12:34.070
Vilya snuck out in the evening

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:36.690
after a conversation with another mother

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:39.250
within the group: Veth.

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:41.300
And that is where we left off.

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:44.073
So, as it is Traveler's Eve,

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:47.500
what else would you like to achieve

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:48.840
before for the evening is done

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:52.609
and Traveler Con itself fully engages in the morrow?

00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:59.367
SAM: Do we open one present on Traveler's Eve?

00:12:59.367 --> 00:13:00.374
LAURA: Yeah, just the one.

00:13:00.374 --> 00:13:01.399
It's usually something that everybody

00:13:01.399 --> 00:13:03.537
can participate in, yeah.

00:13:03.537 --> 00:13:04.790
TALIESIN: Mine's just batteries.

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:05.830
LAURA: Is anybody in the fight?

00:13:05.830 --> 00:13:08.100
Is anybody in the fighting ring?

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:10.810
I said I was going to dance. I'm dancing.

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:16.620
ASHLEY: I'm going to go dance with Jester.

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:17.940
MATT: Okay.

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:20.356
ASHLEY: I do like dancing. I don't get to do it a lot.

00:13:20.356 --> 00:13:21.389
LAURA: It's super fun.

00:13:22.232 --> 00:13:23.982
SAM: Caleb, do you want to come dance?

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:27.090
LIAM: With you, <i>ja</i>.

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:28.350
SAM: Yes, of course.

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:29.848
LIAM: Okay.
SAM: All right.

00:13:29.848 --> 00:13:31.290
LIAM: Sure.

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:33.190
I don't know many.

00:13:33.190 --> 00:13:34.840
SAM: You just need one.

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:35.673
LIAM: Okay.

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:41.530
LAURA: Oh good, Caleb and Veth are coming.

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:43.480
Good, you can do the wiggle with us.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.313
LIAM: I don't--

00:13:44.313 --> 00:13:46.880
LAURA: You go like this and you just wiggle.

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:47.960
LIAM: Okay.
LAURA: That's a good one.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.968
ASHLEY: You just, you know, move your hips and wiggle.

00:13:50.968 --> 00:13:53.000
LAURA: Ooh, Yasha, you should put your wings out

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:54.870
while you dance. It would be super cool-looking.

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:56.430
ASHLEY: I feel like there wouldn't be enough room

00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:58.095
and I could knock people over.

00:13:58.095 --> 00:13:59.107
LAURA: Oh, that's true.

00:13:59.107 --> 00:14:01.410
LIAM: It's freeform, there's no syncopation

00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:02.891
or anything to it. You just do it?

00:14:02.891 --> 00:14:04.259
LAURA: You kind of move to the beat, Caleb.

00:14:04.259 --> 00:14:05.434
LIAM: Do what you feel.
LAURA: Yeah.

00:14:05.434 --> 00:14:07.180
ASHLEY: And like, you know, flip your hair.

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:08.590
LAURA: Yeah, I'm dancing like Molly Ringwald

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:10.188
in The Breakfast Club.

00:14:10.188 --> 00:14:11.305
For sure.
TRAVIS: Good pull.

00:14:11.305 --> 00:14:13.888
LIAM: I have a lot of hair now, so.

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:16.123
LAURA: It's everywhere.

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:22.060
TALIESIN: I'm going to get some distance from everything

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:24.455
and sit and watch.

00:14:24.455 --> 00:14:27.740
And maybe-- is there anyone out by the stage

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:28.573
that's been built?

00:14:28.573 --> 00:14:30.440
Or any of the stuff that's been put up,

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.570
or is it kind of--?

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:34.340
MATT: The stage, yes.

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:36.640
It's mostly constructed,

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:37.760
but it's serviceable at the moment.

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:40.020
There are a couple people that are finalizing

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:42.098
getting another set of stairs on one side.

00:14:42.098 --> 00:14:44.710
It's, you know,

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:46.290
the necessary final elements before

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:48.180
the actual day that our events are planned

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:49.310
for to commence.

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:51.110
However, on the stage you can see

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:53.610
there's a handful of musicians that are

00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:54.990
just jamming.

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:57.270
They just met, and they're all finding

00:14:57.270 --> 00:15:00.210
some semblance of musical unity amongst them.

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:02.980
No specific songs, just figuring out

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:06.530
how to blend their various performances together.

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:08.460
But beyond that, most of the stage is relatively empty.

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:10.543
There's no focal point for a performance.

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:12.900
TRAVIS: I'll join you,

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:16.015
since you're so good at keeping an eye out.

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:20.147
Not that the revelry isn't, you know, interesting.

00:15:20.147 --> 00:15:22.108
I'm not quite comfortable.

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:24.614
MARISHA: I'll slide over with the guys.

00:15:24.614 --> 00:15:25.478
MATT: Okay.

00:15:25.478 --> 00:15:27.760
MARISHA: I see them sitting down.

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:31.334
Bring over a couple of rum punches.

00:15:31.334 --> 00:15:32.963
SAM: Ooh, island-y.

00:15:34.108 --> 00:15:35.810
MARISHA: It's all we have is rum. That's all that

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:37.810
Kent Plucker brought. I'm sorry.

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.120
TRAVIS: Oh shit, right.

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.803
TALIESIN: Having sudden trepidation.

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:46.408
MARISHA: Wait, what? What do you mean?

00:15:47.666 --> 00:15:49.803
TALIESIN: I don't want to rain on anybody's parade.

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:53.400
TRAVIS: You won't rain on our parade. You can speak freely.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:57.768
TALIESIN: I don't know. Watching that conversation

00:15:57.768 --> 00:16:02.768
with the Traveler we had earlier.

00:16:03.159 --> 00:16:04.630
I don't know, just...

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:05.463
MARISHA: Bad vibes?

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:08.530
TALIESIN: I'm worried about tomorrow.

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:10.723
I wasn't, now I am.

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:16.030
TRAVIS: In all of it, or is it a specific part

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:18.350
that's giving you the heebie-jeebies?

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:22.030
TALIESIN: I am worried that there's more to this

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:23.546
than is being said.

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:27.185
That maybe this isn't

00:16:27.185 --> 00:16:30.368
just about unloading

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:33.905
a bunch of people.

00:16:33.905 --> 00:16:35.780
TRAVIS: It is odd, isn't it?

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:38.980
To go through 200-some odd people,

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:39.990
and bring them to an island.

00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:42.180
You can just speak to all of them all at once,

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:44.130
and be like, "Hey, changed my mind, guess what?

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:45.560
"Not a thing."

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:46.973
It's a lot of work.

00:16:46.973 --> 00:16:49.890
TALIESIN: Feel like it's a lot of work

00:16:49.890 --> 00:16:51.413
to make a complicated breakup.

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:54.180
TRAVIS: Yeah, right.

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:56.263
TALIESIN: I don't know.

00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:01.720
And I'm comfortable with the idea

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:06.440
that gods can be complicated in their

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:09.563
view of morality and how they express themselves on...

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:12.363
on the planet.

00:17:12.363 --> 00:17:15.647
But I don't know.

00:17:15.647 --> 00:17:19.913
He seemed awfully quick to embrace some bad ideas.

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:22.660
TRAVIS: The Traveler?

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:23.520
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.500
MARISHA: I mean, that's kind of his jam though, right?

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:27.363
I mean, he's a fucking charlatan.

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:35.280
TALIESIN: Even a charlatan knows how to play to the crowd.

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:36.690
TRAVIS: Sure.

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:38.973
Do you know if-- I don't know.

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:42.505
What would 200 people be good for?

00:17:44.262 --> 00:17:46.954
TALIESIN: I don't know.
TRAVIS: In a religious or wackadoo sense?

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:51.400
TALIESIN: Or for that matter, what would the faith

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.033
of 200 people be worth?

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:56.573
What the sacrifice of 200 people be worth?

00:17:59.148 --> 00:18:00.281
MARISHA: You're not wrong.

00:18:00.281 --> 00:18:01.989
TRAVIS: Do we still think that's a possibility?

00:18:01.989 --> 00:18:03.620
The latter one,

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:04.760
the sacrifice?

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:06.372
TALIESIN: He seemed keen.

00:18:06.372 --> 00:18:07.827
TRAVIS: He did.

00:18:07.827 --> 00:18:10.077
Or at least nonplussed about it.

00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:15.931
TALIESIN: Pleased, but quick to move on.

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:19.420
LIAM: Caleb dances by.
TALIESIN: I don't know, seems chaotic.

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:21.520
LIAM: Sorry, and grabs a drink out of Fjord's hand

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:23.469
while they're talking and downs it and goes by.

00:18:23.469 --> 00:18:24.560
TRAVIS: Ah!
LIAM: Sorry.

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:27.052
MARISHA: Oh, that one is the Ruby of the Sea.

00:18:27.052 --> 00:18:28.740
It's got a little grenadine.

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:29.573
LIAM: Whatever works!

00:18:29.573 --> 00:18:30.870
TRAVIS: Themed drinks, that's great.

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:32.953
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)

00:18:34.373 --> 00:18:36.539
TALIESIN: I don't know. I'm riding a delicate line

00:18:36.539 --> 00:18:37.940
between being cautious

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:41.470
and not ruining Jester's big day.

00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:43.700
MARISHA: Well, I think we are all

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:46.370
in a silent agreement that

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:50.150
we don't ruin Jester's big day,

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:53.173
but we keep an eye on her, right?

00:18:54.337 --> 00:18:56.400
We haven't talked about this on the side

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:57.247
without Jester.

00:18:57.247 --> 00:18:58.832
TALIESIN: Oh, that's really helpful, because I didn't know

00:18:58.832 --> 00:19:00.075
anybody else was on board with this.

00:19:00.075 --> 00:19:02.880
MARISHA: Oh yeah, this whole thing is bananas.

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:03.713
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:19:03.713 --> 00:19:04.990
TRAVIS: I think we're all sort of of the,

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:08.160
"As long as Jester isn't hurt by this, then great," but?

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:11.620
MARISHA: Right, but the second that she does,

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:14.250
I want to punch this guy in the face so bad.

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:18.197
I mean, he has a face that you just want to punch.

00:19:18.197 --> 00:19:20.469
TRAVIS: I wanted to shoot some (whoosh) at him.

00:19:20.469 --> 00:19:21.687
Just to see what would happen.

00:19:21.687 --> 00:19:25.180
MARISHA: Yeah, it's just-- yeah.

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:26.300
I don't know.

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:27.690
TRAVIS: I mean, I think we agree

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:30.450
we can't let her go off with him at any time

00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:31.720
just by themselves, right?

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:34.210
Especially to like a volcano top, or anything like that.

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:35.690
Right, we'll stand firm?

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:37.942
TALIESIN: He may even do something very public.

00:19:37.942 --> 00:19:39.870
MARISHA: You think he would hurt Jester?

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:41.483
TALIESIN: I think he would hurt anybody.

00:19:42.766 --> 00:19:44.350
MARISHA: Because last time that I

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:45.910
went through a complicated breakup,

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:47.423
someone ended up in prison.

00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:51.077
So I think what I am concerned about--

00:19:51.077 --> 00:19:52.930
TRAVIS: <i>Prison</i> prison?
MARISHA: Yeah, don't worry about it.

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:55.190
I think what I'm concerned about

00:19:55.190 --> 00:20:00.190
is I don't want Jester to become the fall guy.

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:03.280
TALIESIN: That's fair, but--

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:05.670
MARISHA: That's the way I'm afraid he's going to hurt her.

00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:07.200
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.033
MARISHA: I don't know.

00:20:08.033 --> 00:20:10.050
TRAVIS: Oh god, I think Yasha just actually elbowed

00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:10.883
that poor fellow.

00:20:10.883 --> 00:20:13.870
MARISHA: Ooh! Oh my god, it's turning into a mosh pit!

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:15.463
TRAVIS: Is that what that is?

00:20:15.463 --> 00:20:18.186
MARISHA: Aww, I hope this gets bloody.

00:20:18.186 --> 00:20:20.199
This is great.

00:20:20.199 --> 00:20:21.032
SAM: Ah!

00:20:21.032 --> 00:20:22.115
LAURA: I'm going to make my way

00:20:22.115 --> 00:20:24.040
off of the dance floor.

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:26.593
It's getting a little crazy.

00:20:26.593 --> 00:20:27.910
TALIESIN: I feel better knowing.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.643
I'm just going to try and be ready tomorrow for anything.

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:35.290
MARISHA: I'm in on you. Or-- in on you with that.

00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:36.753
I'm with you.

00:20:36.753 --> 00:20:37.586
TRAVIS: Words?

00:20:37.586 --> 00:20:38.419
LAURA: I'm hopping over.

00:20:38.419 --> 00:20:39.527
TALIESIN: Drinking the Ruby of the Sea.

00:20:39.527 --> 00:20:41.338
MARISHA: Ruby of the Sea is fucking strong.

00:20:41.338 --> 00:20:43.090
LAURA: What are you guys talking about?

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:45.430
MARISHA: How this Ruby of the Sea is fucking strong,

00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:49.260
and also how we would kill anybody who hurt you.

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:51.250
LAURA: Oh, cool. Thanks, guys.
TALIESIN: Not wrong.

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:53.730
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're all eyes on securities for tomorrow.

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:56.021
That's that's our number one.

00:20:56.021 --> 00:20:57.453
LAURA: Security team!
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Yeah.

00:20:57.453 --> 00:20:58.736
TRAVIS: You are sweaty.

00:20:58.736 --> 00:21:00.590
LAURA: It was very hot on the dance floor.

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:02.687
TRAVIS: It is an island.
MARISHA: It's humid.

00:21:02.687 --> 00:21:05.240
LAURA: Hey, Caduceus, can I talk to you?

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:07.238
I have some questions.
MARISHA: What the fuck?

00:21:07.238 --> 00:21:08.961
TRAVIS: What's the matter with you?

00:21:08.961 --> 00:21:10.501
MARISHA: What the fuck?

00:21:10.501 --> 00:21:11.663
LAURA: So stupid.

00:21:11.663 --> 00:21:14.559
MARISHA: We tried to-- no! Oh no.

00:21:14.559 --> 00:21:16.933
Oh my god.
TRAVIS: How much time did that take?

00:21:16.933 --> 00:21:19.343
MARISHA: Where did you get that?

00:21:19.343 --> 00:21:20.843
I want one.
ASHLEY: It must be so heavy

00:21:20.843 --> 00:21:21.676
at this point.

00:21:21.676 --> 00:21:22.964
(laughter)

00:21:22.964 --> 00:21:24.768
TALIESIN: There's too many layers to that.

00:21:24.768 --> 00:21:27.185
ASHLEY: So much work to take a sip.

00:21:29.487 --> 00:21:30.765
TRAVIS: There's nothing in there, is it?

00:21:30.765 --> 00:21:32.632
LIAM: ♪ Transformers ♪

00:21:32.632 --> 00:21:34.677
(laughter)

00:21:34.677 --> 00:21:36.892
SAM: Oh, so heavy, ow.

00:21:36.892 --> 00:21:38.540
LAURA: Caduceus, can I talk to you for a second?

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:40.040
TALIESIN: Yeah, I got very distracted.

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:43.580
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to sit down next to Caduceus.

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:45.471
Okay, so I have some questions.
TALIESIN: All right.

00:21:45.471 --> 00:21:48.396
LAURA: So you knew stuff about this

00:21:48.396 --> 00:21:50.970
Moon Weaver? Moon Mommy? Moon--?

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:51.803
TALIESIN: I know a little bit.

00:21:51.803 --> 00:21:54.211
It's not really my thing, but yeah.

00:21:54.211 --> 00:21:55.044
LAURA: Moon Weaver?

00:21:55.044 --> 00:21:55.877
TALIESIN: Moon Weaver, yeah.

00:21:55.877 --> 00:21:57.610
LAURA: What does she look like?

00:21:57.610 --> 00:22:01.600
TALIESIN: Oh, from what I remember,

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:04.460
she would take a lot of forms, because she's,

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:07.450
you know, very into illusion and change.

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:10.750
She has been described as blue, if I can recall?

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:13.480
Like a-- not a tiefling, if I remember,

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:15.610
but as a blue wisp.

00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:17.126
I'd have to--
LAURA: A blue wisp?

00:22:17.126 --> 00:22:18.800
TALIESIN: I'd have to remember. It's been a long time

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:22.980
since I buried anybody

00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:25.360
who was a follower of the Moon Weaver.

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:28.390
LAURA: Does she have any symbology that I need to know,

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:29.690
or anything?

00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:31.073
TALIESIN: Well, it's--

00:22:33.306 --> 00:22:35.464
believe her symbol is of a moon.

00:22:35.464 --> 00:22:37.570
LAURA: Is it of one of the moons, or both of them?

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:38.910
TALIESIN: The big moon.

00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:39.743
LAURA: Okay.

00:22:39.743 --> 00:22:44.070
TALIESIN: And it's about illusion, and not necessarily

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:47.230
tricking people, but of play and

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:49.130
of dance, if I recall.

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:51.410
And having a good time,

00:22:51.410 --> 00:22:55.976
and not cruel illusions,

00:22:55.976 --> 00:22:57.927
but playfulness and trickery.

00:22:57.927 --> 00:22:59.140
MATT: You would know that--

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:00.623
TALIESIN: Thank you, I didn't look at my notes.

00:23:00.623 --> 00:23:02.856
MATT: Yeah, it's all good.

00:23:02.856 --> 00:23:04.300
You would know-- and you can convey this

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:05.263
to Jester as well--

00:23:06.471 --> 00:23:10.010
Sehanine is very much about trickery and deception

00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:13.410
for the purposes of

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:15.330
trysts and protection of those

00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:19.445
that go under the cover of shadow for the good of love.

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:25.462
It's not by any means considered to be a

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:29.653
antagonistic type of trickery.

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:32.590
TALIESIN: She is blue, if I recall.

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:36.090
MATT: Yeah, a pale blue of skin.

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:38.203
Usually white or silver of hair.

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:40.850
And the symbol, which you have seen,

00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:42.840
and was mixed in with the Traveler symbol

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:44.210
through a lot of the illusions you guys had built

00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:45.193
last time when you were over here,

00:23:45.193 --> 00:23:49.160
which is a bow string, that's like a crescent moon.

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:53.270
And it has been blended with a lot of, well,

00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:54.240
gateways and dicks.

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.975
So, there's that.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:57.833
LAURA: Cool.

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:02.185
I like that she's, like, tricky for love,

00:24:02.185 --> 00:24:03.200
you know, that's cool.

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.033
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:06.600
Have you ever, well,

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.730
I suppose it would be a little odd at this point,

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:11.380
but have you tried to make introductions yet or?

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:13.190
LAURA: No, I thought about maybe I should talk to her

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:14.590
or something, right?

00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:16.315
TALIESIN: Could be interesting.

00:24:16.315 --> 00:24:18.628
LAURA: Should I just, like, talk to her?

00:24:18.628 --> 00:24:19.461
How should I do it?

00:24:19.461 --> 00:24:22.200
I've never talked to a real god before.

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.860
TALIESIN: Well, I mean, do you know how to--

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:26.310
you've practiced the Commune before.

00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:30.040
LAURA: Yes. Oh. Oh! I can use that on her?

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.612
TALIESIN: I don't know.

00:24:31.612 --> 00:24:33.628
TRAVIS: (laughs)

00:24:34.670 --> 00:24:35.680
LAURA: That seems weird.

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:39.990
TALIESIN: It does seem weird, but you know, so do you.

00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:42.720
MARISHA: Is that something that
the Traveler can intercept on?

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:44.500
Like, will he see your texts?

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:45.400
Will he know?

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:47.680
LAURA: I mean, he might, but it's all for him anyway.

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:49.740
So I don't see why it would be a problem.

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:50.573
MARISHA: That's true.

00:24:50.573 --> 00:24:52.234
LAURA: I mean, maybe he knows about her.

00:24:52.234 --> 00:24:54.080
I don't know where he is. I'm sure he's dressed as somebody

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:55.648
I can't see right now, but.

00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:59.570
TALIESIN: Happy to try, if you want help.

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:03.610
LAURA: Yeah, do you want to go somewhere private

00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:06.418
then we can-- we can commune.
TALIESIN: That sounds...

00:25:06.418 --> 00:25:10.102
LAURA: You guys, that sounds like
I just propositioned Caduceus.

00:25:10.102 --> 00:25:11.421
(laughter)

00:25:11.421 --> 00:25:13.898
TALIESIN: Never communed with
another person, this will be exciting.

00:25:13.898 --> 00:25:15.530
(laughter)

00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:18.109
Yeah, let's try this.
LAURA: All right.

00:25:18.109 --> 00:25:19.217
Where should we go?

00:25:19.217 --> 00:25:21.390
TALIESIN: Uh, somewhere where it's a little quieter

00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:24.952
and we can see the sky properly.

00:25:24.952 --> 00:25:26.827
LAURA: Okay, so let's take a little--

00:25:26.827 --> 00:25:29.590
how long is it to go down to, like, the beach or something?

00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:30.520
TALIESIN: Ooh, that's good.

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:32.703
MATT: Down to the beach from
the village, it's a couple hours.

00:25:32.703 --> 00:25:34.328
LAURA: Oh, that's a long walk.

00:25:34.328 --> 00:25:35.619
Let's not do that.
TALIESIN: Maybe go up the hill a bit.

00:25:35.619 --> 00:25:37.294
LAURA: Yeah, how about that?

00:25:37.294 --> 00:25:38.959
Outside of the village a little bit.

00:25:38.959 --> 00:25:41.090
So we can see the moon, obviously.

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:42.572
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Oh, this will be fun.

00:25:42.572 --> 00:25:43.822
MARISHA: Have fun.

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:46.500
MATT: So it's hard to see the moon

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:48.883
because it is, like, right on the horizon.

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:52.440
So you have to get a little ways up the mountain side

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:55.003
to at least get above the initial
tree line to actually see it.

00:25:55.003 --> 00:25:59.063
And it is partially obscured by the horizon.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:00.833
The water.

00:26:00.833 --> 00:26:02.290
LAURA: Is it coming up or going down?

00:26:03.458 --> 00:26:06.520
It's coming up.
MATT: Make a survival check.

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:08.020
Survival or nature, your choice.

00:26:10.616 --> 00:26:12.414
LAURA: Ugh, where is this,

00:26:12.414 --> 00:26:13.933
this, this, this?

00:26:13.933 --> 00:26:15.550
Survival or nature.

00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:16.751
TALIESIN: You don't want me to help.

00:26:16.751 --> 00:26:18.088
TRAVIS: So many people deciding.

00:26:18.088 --> 00:26:20.687
LAURA: Oh, ooh!

00:26:20.687 --> 00:26:21.520
23.

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:22.353
TALIESIN: So much hair flipping.

00:26:22.353 --> 00:26:23.973
MATT: Very nice.
TALIESIN: That was great.

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:26.770
MATT: It is diminishing.

00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:28.349
It is disappearing on the horizon.

00:26:28.349 --> 00:26:30.180
LAURA: Oh, we have to hurry.

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:31.013
TALIESIN: All right.

00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:34.498
LAURA: Okay.

00:26:34.498 --> 00:26:37.033
And then we'll sit down and spend, like, 10 minutes.

00:26:37.033 --> 00:26:38.341
TALIESIN: All right, let's do this.
LAURA: How do we set up?

00:26:38.341 --> 00:26:39.910
I only ever, like, you know,

00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:44.313
put up like dick statues or fake symbols or whatever.

00:26:44.313 --> 00:26:46.727
I'm going to draw a moon on the ground, that probably helps.

00:26:46.727 --> 00:26:49.150
TALIESIN: Yeah we'll-- I'll set up a little thing

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:52.230
for, yeah, for the Earth Mother.

00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:53.650
We'll add in the Moon Weaver symbol

00:26:53.650 --> 00:26:55.840
and just try and make a big focusing circle

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:56.673
and see how this goes.

00:26:56.673 --> 00:26:57.981
LAURA: Yeah.

00:26:57.981 --> 00:27:00.220
MATT: It's like two teenagers with their first Ouija board.

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:01.648
LAURA: Yeah, very much.

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:05.280
MATT: All right, so you take a little bit of time

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:08.220
using what elements of iconography you can recall,

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:11.993
being not a specialist in the Moon Weaver's history.

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:15.844
You improvise a space here with

00:27:15.844 --> 00:27:18.240
what faint bit of moonlight can reach you

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:20.350
on this side of the mountain.

00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:23.740
TALIESIN: I'm also going to cast Disguise Self on myself.

00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:25.440
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Seems appropriate.

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:26.870
MATT: Take the form of--?

00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:29.281
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a form of what I imagine

00:27:29.281 --> 00:27:31.390
what the Moon Weaver looks like.

00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:35.140
So I'm just going to make myself blue and smaller,

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:38.760
and with the white hair and do the whole thing.

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:39.750
MATT: Okay.

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:41.550
TALIESIN: I figure an illusionary disguise is appropriate.

00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:43.610
LAURA: Ooh, you look very lovely.

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:45.938
TALIESIN: Thank you.
MATT: All right.

00:27:45.938 --> 00:27:49.290
And then you're casting the spell?

00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:50.856
LAURA: Yes. Commune.
MATT: Commune.

00:27:50.856 --> 00:27:53.120
TALIESIN: I'm going to also cast Commune to try and help.

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:55.300
LAURA: Ooh, double Commune.

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:56.800
TALIESIN: Double Commune.

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:57.633
MATT: Okay.

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:01.970
As you both, quietly facing each other,

00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:05.363
focus on the small arrangement in front of you.

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:09.300
LAURA: Do we both put our hands like,

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:13.057
is it two fingers or just one finger?

00:28:13.057 --> 00:28:14.481
TALIESIN: Do two fingers each.

00:28:14.481 --> 00:28:16.640
LIAM: Two and two, I think.
MATT: There you go.

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:22.190
Both echoing chants that are similar in some ways,

00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:25.300
but different based on the source

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:27.753
of the divine magic that you are both channeling.

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:32.680
For you, Caduceus, you close your eyes

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:35.040
and you imagine the moon in its fullness

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.033
in a full state.

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:39.460
The white glow.

00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:43.720
And as you focus on it,

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:47.330
you sense that warm breeze come around you once more.

00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:49.423
You hear the wind pushing through leaves.

00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:54.910
And you sense the presence of the Wild Mother around you.

00:28:54.910 --> 00:28:58.390
TALIESIN: Can you help my friend contact the Moon Weaver?

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:04.673
MATT: The breeze is a bit chilled.

00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:11.040
You feel the sense of the nature of this magic,

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:15.523
this spell, is based around

00:29:15.523 --> 00:29:19.430
the intense connection
you have with the Wild Mother.

00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:23.095
So the reaction and response you get

00:29:23.095 --> 00:29:26.370
leads you to believe that such contact

00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:31.370
would be not possible through direct Commune means.

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:36.943
You, as you concentrate and think of the moon,

00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:40.077
take a deep breath.

00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:45.935
Then you hear--

00:29:45.935 --> 00:29:46.951
(hiccup)

00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:50.560
You open your eyes and look over

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:53.230
and zigzagging up the path

00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:56.330
you see a green cloak-wearing individual

00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:58.920
with his hood back carrying a large

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:00.010
somewhat rusted tankard.

00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:05.010
He goes, "So you're looking for me, are you?"

00:30:05.757 --> 00:30:09.730
LAURA: Oh, I guess it's only works on you then, huh?

00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:11.800
MATT: "Well, I don't know who else you would be talking to,

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:14.070
"it's sort of the point of communing is to speak

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:17.642
"with your chosen patron, I mean."

00:30:17.642 --> 00:30:19.080
LAURA: Right, right, right, that makes sense.

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:20.290
MATT: "What do you need, what's going on?

00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:22.070
LAURA: Well, I was trying to just, you know,

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:24.118
talk to the Moon Weaver.

00:30:24.118 --> 00:30:24.951
MATT: "Oh."

00:30:24.951 --> 00:30:27.135
LAURA: So that, you know, when we do what do we do tomorrow

00:30:27.135 --> 00:30:30.911
that I'm not, like, speaking totally out of my butt.

00:30:32.617 --> 00:30:35.370
MATT: "I'm not entirely certain how one would do that

00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:38.310
"aside from, I guess, just praying."

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:40.050
LAURA: Oh.
MATT: "If they're even listening,

00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:41.366
"I don't know. Gods are weird.

00:30:41.366 --> 00:30:43.507
"Especially Sehanine.

00:30:43.507 --> 00:30:45.665
"She tends to wander through the Feywild quite a bit."

00:30:45.665 --> 00:30:47.410
LAURA: Have you ever met her?

00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:49.240
MATT: "No, not directly.

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:51.410
"I've seen her, but it's more of like a, you know--

00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:52.903
"we're aware of each other.

00:30:52.903 --> 00:30:55.470
"You know, different friend groups.

00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:56.640
LAURA: Right, right, right.

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:58.650
So she's blue, though?

00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:02.100
MATT: "From the forms I've seen, yes."
LAURA: Wow.

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:04.730
MATT: "I mean, we have some overlap, but you know,

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:06.490
"respectfully keep a distance."

00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:09.294
LAURA: Is she going to be cool with this?

00:31:09.294 --> 00:31:10.676
MATT: "I hope."

00:31:10.676 --> 00:31:12.750
LAURA: I mean, she probably doesn't have a problem

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:14.260
with people worshiping her?

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:15.900
MATT: "Probably, I can't imagine she would."

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:16.991
LAURA: Right.

00:31:18.325 --> 00:31:20.250
Oh man.

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:22.475
Do we got to, like, pray or something now?

00:31:24.153 --> 00:31:27.047
MATT: "Well, you've got three questions
you could ask, if you wanted to.

00:31:28.064 --> 00:31:29.650
"That is what the spell does."

00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:31.300
LAURA: This is true.

00:31:32.949 --> 00:31:35.357
Um...

00:31:35.357 --> 00:31:37.230
Are you worried about tomorrow at all?

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:44.440
MATT: "As worried as an individual with my lifespan

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:46.415
"and capabilities could be, maybe.

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:49.980
"Just because it's-- it's unknown.

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:52.850
"That's also exhilarating, isn't it?

00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:54.543
"Excitement, the butterflies."

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:02.070
LAURA: What does it mean for our relationship

00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:03.953
now that I know you're not a god?

00:32:05.573 --> 00:32:07.506
Does it have to be a yes or no question?

00:32:09.103 --> 00:32:13.990
MATT: "I mean, I can, I can vague doublespeak

00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:17.570
"around the answer; it's what I'm very good at.

00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:20.533
"I don't see it has to change at all.

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:22.701
"I hope not."

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:32.521
LAURA: Why was I your first?

00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:36.720
MATT: "Who knows?

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:39.150
"Chaos works in strange ways.

00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:43.293
"Whether it was happenstance or it was destiny.

00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:46.740
"Or I just saw a spark of little shit-kicker

00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:48.890
"that needed a friend, who knows?

00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:52.933
"But, I'm glad by whatever grace brought us together.

00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:55.335
"Here we are."

00:32:55.335 --> 00:32:56.168
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

00:32:58.998 --> 00:33:01.588
MATT: "Do you know how challenging it is for an archfey

00:33:01.588 --> 00:33:02.980
"to get drunk?"

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:05.162
LAURA: I know, you seemed drunk for like five seconds

00:33:05.162 --> 00:33:06.668
and then you're already sober again.

00:33:06.668 --> 00:33:09.070
MATT: "I have drinken so much alcohol tonight."

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:11.427
LAURA: Well, you did say "drinken,"
so you're a little bit--

00:33:11.427 --> 00:33:13.120
MATT: "That's not true."

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:14.763
(laughter)

00:33:14.763 --> 00:33:16.263
"I'm a little numb.

00:33:17.159 --> 00:33:20.520
"Anyway, alcohol is just not the same here

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:22.743
"in the Prime Material Plane."

00:33:22.743 --> 00:33:24.671
(dice thunks against metal)
LAURA: Do you miss the Feywild ever?

00:33:24.671 --> 00:33:29.671
(laughter)

00:33:30.131 --> 00:33:31.475
Do you miss the Feywild?

00:33:31.475 --> 00:33:33.208
MATT: "The spell is over."
LAURA: Oh, come on!

00:33:33.208 --> 00:33:36.670
MATT: "I can still talk to you, it's fine, it's fine.
LAURA: I know!

00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:38.250
MATT: "Ah, there are aspects of it I miss,

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:42.036
"but I don't know.

00:33:42.036 --> 00:33:43.487
"I feel like I've seen it all.

00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:46.260
"And for as much as it keeps changing and yet

00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:49.220
"still stays the same in so many ways.

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:50.520
"It gets boring.

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:53.286
"I hate boring, I get bored easy."

00:33:53.286 --> 00:33:54.694
LAURA: I know.

00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:59.577
MATT: "Wild eyes."

00:33:59.577 --> 00:34:03.043
LAURA: Um, I'm trying to think

00:34:03.043 --> 00:34:04.935
of any other questions I have for you.

00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:08.990
MATT: "He's very focused on something."

00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:10.082
LAURA: Oh yeah, he always looks like that.

00:34:10.082 --> 00:34:12.470
He looks kind of high whenever he's communing.

00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:14.120
MATT: He snaps his fingers and in your hand

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:15.010
is a little paint brush

00:34:15.010 --> 00:34:18.060
with some black paint on the tip and goes--

00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:20.422
LAURA: I paint a little mustache,

00:34:20.422 --> 00:34:23.106
and I paint a little monocle around his eye.

00:34:23.106 --> 00:34:24.678
(laughter)

00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:28.401
MATT: "And that is why you're my first."

00:34:28.401 --> 00:34:31.700
(laughs)

00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:34.043
TALIESIN: Kid at the party with a Sharpie, aren't you?

00:34:35.588 --> 00:34:37.310
MATT: I think that was actually her backstory.

00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:39.070
LAURA: Yeah, actually.

00:34:39.070 --> 00:34:42.215
MATT: "Well, nevertheless, I'm going
to get back to the festivities."

00:34:42.215 --> 00:34:43.260
LAURA: All right.

00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:44.720
MATT: "Let me know if you need anything."

00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:47.470
LAURA: All right, I'm not going to try to do that again.

00:34:47.470 --> 00:34:49.638
MATT: "I mean, you can;
I don't mind the conversation."

00:34:49.638 --> 00:34:50.638
LAURA: All right.

00:34:51.675 --> 00:34:53.699
MATT: "Sleep well."
LAURA: You too.

00:34:53.699 --> 00:34:54.761
LAURA: Are we doing this-- wait wait,

00:34:54.761 --> 00:34:56.336
are we doing this in the evening or in the morning?

00:34:56.336 --> 00:34:57.465
What are we doing?

00:34:57.465 --> 00:34:59.384
MATT: "Well, it's a day of celebration,
I thought. There's events."

00:34:59.384 --> 00:35:01.928
LAURA: A whole day?
MATT: "You've carved dicks and there's performance.

00:35:01.928 --> 00:35:03.753
"And then at night--"
LAURA: We do the--

00:35:03.753 --> 00:35:05.392
MATT: "Yes, it is the Moon Weaver."

00:35:05.392 --> 00:35:06.225
LAURA: All right.

00:35:06.225 --> 00:35:08.135
MATT: "Well," and he looks over,

00:35:08.135 --> 00:35:09.920
"We may not have a moon."

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:11.356
LAURA: Wait, what do you mean?

00:35:11.356 --> 00:35:13.528
MATT: "It's, well it's going away."

00:35:13.528 --> 00:35:16.445
LAURA: Yeah, but it's going away
cause the morning's coming, right?

00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:18.910
MATT: "But it doesn't-- there isn't

00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:21.510
"a sun-moon cycle in the same day.

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:23.533
"The moon revolves in a month."

00:35:23.533 --> 00:35:25.456
LAURA: What do you mean?
We're not going to have a moon tomorrow?

00:35:25.456 --> 00:35:26.600
MATT: "We'll figure something out.

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:28.902
"Illusion is very effective."

00:35:28.902 --> 00:35:32.962
LAURA: What do you mean, we have to <i>make</i> a moon?

00:35:32.962 --> 00:35:34.282
MATT: "Look, this wasn't my idea."

00:35:34.282 --> 00:35:37.067
LAURA: Ugh, why wouldn't there be a moon?

00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:40.452
MATT: "I don't know."

00:35:40.452 --> 00:35:42.610
LAURA: Don't you know how moons work?

00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:46.200
MATT: "I do, but I'm not the Moon Weaver!"

00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:48.350
LAURA: I'm going to pray to her to make a moon.

00:35:48.350 --> 00:35:52.552
MATT: "Well, I think that's a
viable way to spend your time."

00:35:52.552 --> 00:35:55.183
LAURA: Hey, will you be offended if I actually pray to her?

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.720
MATT: "No, just a little jealous."

00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:01.588
LAURA: Ooh, a little jealousy, huh?

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:04.185
That's kind of fun.

00:36:04.185 --> 00:36:05.535
All right.

00:36:05.535 --> 00:36:07.520
MATT: "I'm going to get another drink."

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:09.150
He wanders off.

00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:10.885
Back to Caduceus.

00:36:10.885 --> 00:36:13.737
TALIESIN: I've been very quietly finishing my commune

00:36:13.737 --> 00:36:15.090
because I didn't want anyone to hear.

00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:17.498
MATT: Indeed, what other questions do you have?

00:36:17.498 --> 00:36:19.395
TALIESIN: Is there a follower of the Moon Weaver

00:36:19.395 --> 00:36:20.798
on this island right now?

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:27.380
MATT: You feel the breeze tickle through the trees

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:29.740
and then return chilled again.

00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:33.525
The response seeming to confirm "no."

00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:39.373
TALIESIN: I'm going to do it.

00:36:41.410 --> 00:36:43.477
Is the Traveler being reasonably honest

00:36:43.477 --> 00:36:45.334
about his plans for tomorrow?

00:36:45.334 --> 00:36:46.842
TRAVIS: (whispered) Oh shit!

00:36:48.607 --> 00:36:50.907
MARISHA: (whispered) "Reasonably honest."
MATT: There is...

00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:57.320
You feel the Wild Mother embrace

00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:01.090
the space around you in a comforting way.

00:37:01.090 --> 00:37:02.680
In the way that a mother comforts her child

00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:04.880
when they ask a question that they

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:06.380
don't know the answer to.

00:37:09.144 --> 00:37:10.678
Deities do not have all answers.

00:37:10.678 --> 00:37:11.711
TALIESIN: They do not.

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:14.448
That worries me, okay.

00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:18.300
MATT: And at that point,

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:21.920
you feel the breeze leave, the light of the moon vanish

00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:24.100
and you open your eyes once more, looking to Jester

00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:28.700
as you watch the Traveler make his exit back down the path.

00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:31.480
TALIESIN: Well, I think I have a notion for a plan forward.

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:33.305
LAURA: Oh, yeah?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:37:33.305 --> 00:37:34.560
I don't think we can do it tonight,

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:36.628
but I have some thoughts.

00:37:36.628 --> 00:37:38.082
LAURA: Did you talk to her?

00:37:38.082 --> 00:37:39.430
TALIESIN: No, no.

00:37:39.430 --> 00:37:43.397
I talked to the Wild Mother and she helped.

00:37:43.397 --> 00:37:44.730
LAURA: I talked to the Traveler.

00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:49.469
TALIESIN: So he seemed okay with your plan, or--?

00:37:49.469 --> 00:37:52.950
LAURA: I mean, he came up with it,
so yeah, he's fine with it.

00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:55.953
He was kind of drunk, which was cool to see.

00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:00.070
He told me a little bit about the Moon Weaver.

00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:02.040
Also, there's not going to be a moon tomorrow,

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:04.198
so that's kind of balls.
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's true.

00:38:05.310 --> 00:38:08.543
That's a thing, might have to make
like an illusionary one, I guess.

00:38:08.543 --> 00:38:09.473
Or something like that.

00:38:09.473 --> 00:38:10.648
LAURA: Maybe.

00:38:10.648 --> 00:38:13.430
TALIESIN: Have it appear in the
sky suddenly, that'd be cool.

00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:15.710
LAURA: Yeah, maybe it can start as like fireworks

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:18.084
and then slowly turn into the moon or something.

00:38:18.084 --> 00:38:19.383
TALIESIN: Oh, that would be great.
LAURA: Yeah, right?

00:38:19.383 --> 00:38:20.216
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:22.653
LAURA: All right.

00:38:24.705 --> 00:38:27.610
TALIESIN: It'll be okay, this is a lot of responsibility.

00:38:27.610 --> 00:38:28.660
You're doing good.

00:38:29.728 --> 00:38:31.310
LAURA: I'm freaking out, Caduceus.

00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:32.518
TALIESIN: Yeah, I know.

00:38:34.163 --> 00:38:35.436
LAURA: You know what, though?

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:37.680
It's kind of freeing

00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:41.270
knowing that we're not going to be dooming

00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:42.823
all these people to stay here.

00:38:44.250 --> 00:38:47.608
Whatever happens, you know, at least there's that.

00:38:48.570 --> 00:38:50.890
TALIESIN: Whatever happens, we've already done some good.

00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:51.930
LAURA: We really have.

00:38:51.930 --> 00:38:54.103
TALIESIN: Yeah, you've done some good.

00:38:55.508 --> 00:38:56.800
LAURA: You too.
TALIESIN: Thank you.

00:38:58.050 --> 00:39:00.063
Just, you deserve to celebrate it.

00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:02.510
You're the reason we're here.

00:39:03.963 --> 00:39:05.539
LAURA: Look at all the treasure we got,

00:39:05.539 --> 00:39:07.646
and all the people we saved.

00:39:07.646 --> 00:39:08.860
And all the dancing that happened,

00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:12.010
I only got one bloody nose from an
elbow to the face in the mosh pit.

00:39:12.010 --> 00:39:13.660
TALIESIN: Only one, wow, you took it easy.

00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:19.050
Keep looking at me weird, why? Is there--?

00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:20.564
LAURA: Oh not-- there's nothing.
TALIESIN: Are you sure?

00:39:20.564 --> 00:39:24.040
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, no, you look great, yeah.

00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:26.103
TALIESIN: Drop the-- drop the Disguise Self.

00:39:27.243 --> 00:39:29.580
LAURA: Oh, that's right, you were
the Moon Weaver the whole time.

00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:31.480
TALIESIN: I assume I still have a mustache and a monocle.

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:33.553
MATT: Oh yeah, yeah, very much so.

00:39:34.766 --> 00:39:36.431
LAURA: I wasn't sure if it would stay.

00:39:36.431 --> 00:39:38.222
MATT: What's great, though,
is the mustache and the monocle

00:39:38.222 --> 00:39:40.520
are like slightly smaller on your face

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:43.264
than they should be because they
were drawn for a smaller visage.

00:39:43.264 --> 00:39:46.806
(laughter)

00:39:46.806 --> 00:39:49.685
LIAM: So it's just like his retina instead of a monocle.

00:39:50.914 --> 00:39:51.870
MARISHA: Like a black eye.

00:39:51.870 --> 00:39:53.758
TALIESIN: I'll go find a water basin or something.

00:39:53.758 --> 00:39:54.892
It's just something...

00:39:54.892 --> 00:39:56.929
LAURA: -- feel weird?
TALIESIN: Yeah, I think I did--

00:39:56.929 --> 00:39:58.078
LAURA: Maybe a bug flew in your eye

00:39:58.078 --> 00:40:00.311
while you were communing.

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:03.363
TALIESIN: I'll see you back down.
LAURA: All right.

00:40:04.310 --> 00:40:05.276
MATT: All right.

00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:08.110
Anyone else want to-- yes?

00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:12.800
LIAM: I dance Veth over joyously towards the bar

00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:14.950
and find Beauregard.

00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:16.643
Beauregard, Beauregard, Beauregard, Beauregard.

00:40:16.643 --> 00:40:20.159
MARISHA: Yeah, that's my name.
LIAM: Beauregard, are you still making those--

00:40:20.159 --> 00:40:21.159
"I'm fucking Beau!"

00:40:21.159 --> 00:40:24.400
Are you still making those drinks?
MARISHA: Fucking Beauregard!

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:26.490
Well, yeah, you can totally--

00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:27.480
I worked this out.

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:28.650
You can get a Ruby of the Sea

00:40:28.650 --> 00:40:30.580
or you can get a Chaos Reigns,

00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:31.970
which has, like, Midori in it.

00:40:31.970 --> 00:40:34.020
And it's great-- it looks kind of nasty.

00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:36.460
LIAM: It's too frothy.
MARISHA: What?

00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:37.630
LIAM: I'll do the Ruby of the Sea.

00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:39.660
The other one is-- I saw it-- is too frothy.

00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:41.288
MARISHA: It is, yeah-- it's got egg whites in it,

00:40:41.288 --> 00:40:44.330
which doesn't check out for tropical location.

00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:46.250
LIAM: It works, but 50/50 chance

00:40:46.250 --> 00:40:47.691
of turning your stomach.
MARISHA: Yeah, food poisoning.

00:40:47.691 --> 00:40:49.357
Yeah, it's bad, yeah.

00:40:49.357 --> 00:40:51.820
LIAM: Make us two, would you?

00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:55.593
SAM: I'll take one of the frothy ones, but Caleb,

00:40:55.593 --> 00:40:56.592
not to contradict you,

00:40:56.592 --> 00:40:59.026
I don't think Beauregard is the bartender.

00:40:59.026 --> 00:41:02.070
MARISHA: I'm not, but I could be!

00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:03.180
LIAM: You <i>should</i> be.

00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:06.060
MARISHA: I just jump over the bar and shove the--

00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:08.777
whoever the poor Traveler follower--
LIAM: You were back there before, just--

00:41:08.777 --> 00:41:11.610
MARISHA: Yeah, and I just-- I invented these cocktails.

00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:15.160
So I can just take over for a minute. It's fine.

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:17.435
LIAM: Okay.
(laughter)

00:41:17.435 --> 00:41:19.318
TRAVIS: That is a genteel shake.

00:41:19.318 --> 00:41:20.918
SAM: That's a gentle shake!

00:41:20.918 --> 00:41:25.200
MARISHA: Well, you don't want to over whip the egg whites,

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:26.420
or else they'll start to curdle.

00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:27.807
I don't know, I'm not a mixologist.

00:41:27.807 --> 00:41:30.692
LIAM: What bird did these eggs come from?

00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:32.840
MARISHA: Fuck if I know, dude.

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:33.830
They just brought them to me.

00:41:33.830 --> 00:41:35.420
LIAM: What if they're dinosaur eggs?

00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:36.256
MARISHA: I think they are!

00:41:36.256 --> 00:41:39.244
ASHLEY: Please, could I have another one of the frothies?

00:41:39.244 --> 00:41:42.702
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I slide this one over to Veth.

00:41:43.741 --> 00:41:47.060
I think I got a little-- I just have to-- hang on.

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:47.893
Hang on.

00:41:47.893 --> 00:41:49.790
ASHLEY: I did not realize you were making these, Beau,

00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:53.140
because they are super, super delicious.

00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:55.327
MARISHA: I wasn't until right now. Here you go.

00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:58.760
LIAM: I'll take the gross one.

00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:00.520
MARISHA: Well, no, no, I'm going to make a couple of more

00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:01.353
Ruby of the Seas.

00:42:01.353 --> 00:42:02.960
Just wait, just a second.

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:05.160
MATT: A green-scaled dragon born walks up

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:07.580
with a rather rotund midsection

00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:11.000
and broad shoulders and goes, "Excuse me?"

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.592
MARISHA: Yeah?
MATT: "You the one making the drinks?"

00:42:14.970 --> 00:42:18.285
MARISHA: Just for my friends. What do you--?
SAM: Yes, yep, she's great.

00:42:18.285 --> 00:42:21.653
MATT: "I'll take three of whatever it is you're making."

00:42:21.653 --> 00:42:22.569
MARISHA: Okay, yeah.

00:42:22.569 --> 00:42:24.470
Yeah, okay.

00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:26.178
Yeah, fuck you, Veth.

00:42:26.178 --> 00:42:28.033
MATT: A couple of people start showing up.

00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:30.920
LIAM: Private conversation is not going quite the way

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:32.830
I had anticipated.

00:42:33.730 --> 00:42:36.040
MARISHA: Hang on, hang on, just let me-- here you go, sir.

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:37.807
Here you go. Tips, please.

00:42:37.807 --> 00:42:39.572
Tip your bartender, okay?

00:42:39.572 --> 00:42:41.098
MATT: Tosses a silver over.

00:42:41.098 --> 00:42:43.392
MARISHA: Fucking silver! I fucking toss it back.

00:42:43.392 --> 00:42:44.758
MATT: (impact sound) "Ah!"

00:42:45.809 --> 00:42:48.521
MARISHA: Hang on, hang on.
TRAVIS: Silver's pretty good.

00:42:48.521 --> 00:42:49.354
LAURA: Yeah, I know, right?

00:42:49.354 --> 00:42:52.880
LIAM: Yasha, would you come around and stand in front of her

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:54.530
so that the crowds can't see her as well.

00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:56.016
ASHLEY: Yeah, okay.

00:42:56.016 --> 00:42:57.811
I'll just--

00:42:57.811 --> 00:42:59.250
(laughter)

00:42:59.250 --> 00:43:00.941
TRAVIS: Are you just--

00:43:02.212 --> 00:43:05.587
ASHLEY: No, no this is not a line for drinks, go.

00:43:05.587 --> 00:43:07.300
MARISHA: Sir, here you go.

00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:09.910
You don't-- your crowd-- don't loiter

00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:11.270
in front of the bar, please.

00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:15.570
MATT: Make an intimidation check. (laughs)

00:43:15.570 --> 00:43:17.493
The gentlest intimidation.
ASHLEY: Natural 20.

00:43:17.493 --> 00:43:19.520
(cheering)

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:22.270
MATT: The minute Yasha scoots in and blocks off

00:43:22.270 --> 00:43:23.820
and says that over her shoulder,

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:26.900
not realizing how in her somewhat intoxicated

00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:29.140
and still dance adrenaline pumping self,

00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:30.481
how intense it comes across.

00:43:30.481 --> 00:43:31.859
ASHLEY: (dark voice) This is not a line.

00:43:31.859 --> 00:43:34.630
(laughter)

00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:38.010
MATT: There's a momentary pause, everyone takes a step back,

00:43:38.010 --> 00:43:40.020
look at each other, and they all just scatter

00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:41.030
to the rest of the event.

00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:43.877
And you leave the bar area.
TALIESIN: Want a water bottle, man, god!

00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:46.725
MARISHA: Thank you.

00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:50.021
Bar's closed for 10 minutes.

00:43:51.490 --> 00:43:52.415
'Sup, guys?

00:43:52.415 --> 00:43:54.590
LIAM: So-- wait, did we have, one, two, three--

00:43:54.590 --> 00:43:55.910
she is into it, okay.

00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:56.743
Four drinks?

00:43:56.743 --> 00:44:01.240
MARISHA: Here, let me just do some floaters on top of those.

00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:04.272
Okay, all right. Cheers!

00:44:04.272 --> 00:44:05.322
LIAM: <i>Prost.</i>
ASHLEY: Cheers.

00:44:05.322 --> 00:44:06.572
Cheers, cheers.

00:44:07.530 --> 00:44:09.380
LIAM: This is-- this is it.

00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:10.910
This might be our last night.

00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:12.280
It could be our second to last night,

00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:14.270
but it feels like this is coming to a head.

00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:15.587
SAM: Last night for what?
ASHLEY: Last night--

00:44:15.587 --> 00:44:17.530
are we going to die?

00:44:17.530 --> 00:44:18.597
LIAM: On the island.

00:44:18.597 --> 00:44:19.975
SAM and ASHLEY: Oh!

00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:23.260
SAM: Just everything you say has such a--

00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:25.162
like, a gloomy sort of...

00:44:25.162 --> 00:44:27.310
TRAVIS: (laughs)

00:44:27.310 --> 00:44:29.620
LIAM: That's why I came for the drinks.

00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:32.568
ASHLEY: I was like, wait, I want a little bit more time.

00:44:32.568 --> 00:44:34.336
(laughter)

00:44:34.336 --> 00:44:37.603
LIAM: Who knows what is going to happen though?

00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:40.640
We've been at this-- we've been talking

00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:42.628
about this moment for months,

00:44:42.628 --> 00:44:46.300
and planning for it for a week or more.

00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:47.850
And now we're on top of it.

00:44:47.850 --> 00:44:49.633
What is going to happen?

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:55.650
SAM: Well, I mean, if I know Jester,

00:44:55.650 --> 00:44:58.190
something spectacular will happen.

00:44:58.190 --> 00:45:00.720
And something very, very well thought out.

00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:03.650
Because she's one of the smartest people I know.

00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:08.430
LIAM: Well she is, but I have come to expect the unexpected

00:45:08.430 --> 00:45:09.725
with Miss Lavorre.

00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:14.703
MARISHA: What are you getting at?
LIAM: Well, um...

00:45:14.703 --> 00:45:16.880
MARISHA: I feel like you're like working towards something.

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:17.713
LIAM: Yeah, I am.

00:45:17.713 --> 00:45:18.901
I wasn't.

00:45:18.901 --> 00:45:20.910
ASHLEY: I can go dance.
LIAM: No, stay, please stay.

00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:22.010
SAM: Oh, do you want me to leave?

00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:23.690
LIAM: No, I don't want you to leave.

00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:25.820
MARISHA: Was this supposed to be a private conversation?

00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:28.280
SAM: And if so, with which one of us?

00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:30.464
LIAM: Listen, that is--
ASHLEY: Did you just want <i>me</i> to stay?

00:45:30.464 --> 00:45:34.333
LIAM: -- that is chaos under the bridge at this point.

00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:38.880
Well, I did want to talk to the both of you,

00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:39.900
but please stay.

00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:40.733
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:45.386
LIAM: Whatever this is, it's almost over.

00:45:45.386 --> 00:45:50.210
And I just wanted to feel out the two of you,

00:45:50.210 --> 00:45:51.570
and now you.

00:45:51.570 --> 00:45:55.246
But you, citizens of the Empire.

00:45:57.990 --> 00:46:02.153
Do you have any idea what you wish to do after this?

00:46:05.330 --> 00:46:06.650
Because I do.

00:46:06.650 --> 00:46:09.280
SAM: Oh, well then, why don't you start,

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:14.160
because to be honest, I find myself very conflicted

00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:15.946
as to what to do next.

00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:21.920
You know, we don't have a clear path as a group anymore.

00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:26.130
You know, we've sort of-- we've staved off war,

00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:27.440
at least for the time being.

00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:31.482
And we don't have any life or death

00:46:31.482 --> 00:46:36.065
missions pressing, so...

00:46:36.065 --> 00:46:40.470
I could see myself going home, but you?

00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:43.823
LIAM: Yeah, I would like to go home.

00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:48.452
I would like to go to our home.

00:46:50.529 --> 00:46:52.687
SAM: Your?

00:46:52.687 --> 00:46:54.600
LIAM: <i>Our</i> home.

00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:58.331
MARISHA: How do you mean that?
LIAM: The Empire.

00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:01.010
I want to return to the mainland

00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:04.220
and I would like very much for the both of you

00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:09.190
to come with me, and all of the Nein.

00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:14.825
But I <i>need</i> the two of you.

00:47:16.490 --> 00:47:18.215
I need all of you, but I...

00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:22.906
Whatever happened out there at sea,

00:47:26.187 --> 00:47:28.353
you know it's not as simple as that.

00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:31.900
You know it isn't.

00:47:35.371 --> 00:47:39.913
MARISHA: Was super relishing in
my escapism, but yeah, thank you.

00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:43.670
Of course, this isn't over.

00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:45.610
LIAM: It's not right at home.

00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:50.921
SAM: So you want to go back and make it right?

00:47:53.290 --> 00:47:55.562
We had talked a while back about

00:47:57.600 --> 00:48:00.713
punishing those who had started this all.

00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:03.880
But you know, now we're on a tropical island

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:05.830
and that doesn't seem as pressing.

00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:12.300
LIAM: We are here to help our friend, and she deserves it.

00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:19.100
But I feel inclined to return home

00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:22.598
and understand what is happening at home.

00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:29.881
And I need you, because you are my best friend.

00:48:32.722 --> 00:48:35.815
And I need <i>you</i> as my partner

00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:40.580
to make right.

00:48:42.410 --> 00:48:47.282
And I need all of you, Yasha.

00:48:48.490 --> 00:48:51.260
I was scared to ask up front.

00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:56.258
I figured I'd start with them, but I need you.

00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:02.700
SAM: We came all this way for Jester,

00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:07.010
and I can't imagine that any of us would say no

00:49:07.010 --> 00:49:09.092
to a friend in need, but

00:49:12.342 --> 00:49:15.334
what would we be doing exactly?

00:49:15.334 --> 00:49:19.220
I mean, going to Rexxentrum and enacting

00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:22.541
some sort of vigilante justice?

00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:28.350
LIAM: Well, I'm not sure yet. It's complicated.

00:49:28.350 --> 00:49:29.183
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:49:29.183 --> 00:49:33.746
LIAM: Some of them seem maybe redeemable, maybe.

00:49:35.251 --> 00:49:37.529
MARISHA: We could have vigilante justice.

00:49:38.490 --> 00:49:40.657
Maybe we do it all above the board.

00:49:41.790 --> 00:49:42.623
LIAM: Sure.

00:49:42.623 --> 00:49:46.680
SAM: How-- how would-- you mean work for your organization?

00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:48.173
MARISHA: Maybe.

00:49:48.173 --> 00:49:50.747
SAM: You're gonna (whisper) deputize us?

00:49:50.747 --> 00:49:52.850
MARISHA: Can I do that?
SAM: I think maybe.

00:49:52.850 --> 00:49:53.720
MARISHA: I think I can.

00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:55.400
I think we just decided that I can.

00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:57.013
Yeah, I could do that.

00:49:58.360 --> 00:49:59.920
Yeah.

00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:03.060
We're not, like, the guard, by the way.

00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:05.470
We're, like, librarians. I just want to point that out.

00:50:05.470 --> 00:50:10.470
So you can be, like, deputized librarians.

00:50:10.830 --> 00:50:14.150
SAM: I must admit, we've been
talking about your organization

00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:18.083
for a lot of this campaign, or whatever you--

00:50:18.083 --> 00:50:21.140
but I don't know very much about it at all.

00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:23.210
MARISHA: It's pretty enigmatic, yeah.

00:50:23.210 --> 00:50:25.700
We have, like, a god.
SAM: Wait, what?

00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:26.720
MARISHA: Yeah, totally.

00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:29.330
No, I'm technically kind of like a religious person.

00:50:29.330 --> 00:50:32.605
I was just like, it's whatever.
LIAM: You are like a cleric, then?

00:50:32.605 --> 00:50:34.560
MARISHA: No, I'm not like that at all.

00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:37.620
It's just like-- you know,

00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:42.620
like, Platinum Dragon school or like, you know.

00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:45.020
It's like Ioun school.

00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:47.449
LIAM: I've only ever seen you reverse heal people.

00:50:47.449 --> 00:50:52.236
SAM: Did you have to wear mini, like, plaid skirts and--?

00:50:52.236 --> 00:50:54.777
MARISHA: Well, we had uniforms, yeah.
We're getting off the point.

00:50:54.777 --> 00:50:57.160
Okay, let's get back.
ASHLEY: Wait, who's your god?

00:50:57.160 --> 00:50:59.120
MARISHA: Ioun, The Knowing Mistress.
ASHLEY: Oh, Ioun, Ioun.

00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:00.170
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:51:00.170 --> 00:51:02.048
I mean it's thematic. Yeah.

00:51:02.048 --> 00:51:02.940
ASHLEY: Yeah, cool.

00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:04.200
SAM: What is this? What did you just point to?

00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:06.997
MARISHA: Well it's, like, third eye. That's, like, her.

00:51:06.997 --> 00:51:10.733
I mean, it's-- we're getting off-topic.

00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:13.994
Here's the thing.

00:51:13.994 --> 00:51:15.160
I--

00:51:17.561 --> 00:51:19.270
This is all I have

00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:21.185
is the Mighty Nein.

00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:24.580
To the point of where I was so desperate

00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:28.650
to control the situation of how I theoretically lost you all

00:51:28.650 --> 00:51:32.591
by attempting to

00:51:32.591 --> 00:51:36.474
sacrifice myself to that hag. Because...

00:51:40.548 --> 00:51:43.899
I guess I thought if I could

00:51:43.899 --> 00:51:47.373
control the way that this ended,

00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:53.575
even if it's as innocuous as growing apart,

00:51:57.380 --> 00:51:59.640
that might be less painful.

00:52:02.857 --> 00:52:04.786
Because even the thought of

00:52:07.410 --> 00:52:09.130
simply becoming distant

00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:15.133
means that that would be the second family

00:52:16.043 --> 00:52:20.700
that that would have happened to with me, so...

00:52:24.250 --> 00:52:25.651
I'm all in.

00:52:26.530 --> 00:52:29.650
LIAM: I confess I've been a little worried about the same

00:52:29.650 --> 00:52:33.740
after this visit to this island.

00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:36.110
MARISHA: Do we all have codependency issues?

00:52:36.110 --> 00:52:38.620
Oh my god, you guys, I think we're codependent

00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:39.998
on each other.

00:52:40.890 --> 00:52:42.870
That's cool!

00:52:42.870 --> 00:52:46.490
LIAM: Well, I would hope that the others would come.

00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:48.301
MARISHA: Yeah, me too.

00:52:48.301 --> 00:52:51.292
LIAM: But will you help--

00:52:53.285 --> 00:52:56.518
will you help me convince them if they need convincing?

00:53:02.248 --> 00:53:06.860
SAM: Honestly, I'm a bit conflicted myself.

00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:09.695
I mean, I definitely want to help, but

00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:14.580
I've got to go home at some point.

00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:18.623
And not just to Felderwin. I mean to my family.

00:53:21.540 --> 00:53:22.834
LIAM: Yeah.

00:53:22.834 --> 00:53:25.415
SAM: I don't know if--
LIAM: I'd not forgotten.

00:53:25.415 --> 00:53:29.450
SAM: I want to help, of course.

00:53:29.450 --> 00:53:31.798
I love the Nein as well.

00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:35.325
But, at the same time,

00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:43.050
that feeling of throwing your arms around your child

00:53:43.050 --> 00:53:48.030
that you haven't seen in a long time is on my mind.

00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:52.590
And I need to do it.

00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:58.992
MARISHA: If we go back to the
Empire, maybe you can have both.

00:53:58.992 --> 00:54:02.770
LIAM: And what if you could visit more frequently?

00:54:02.770 --> 00:54:04.262
SAM: What do you mean?

00:54:06.658 --> 00:54:11.490
LIAM: I've been noodling. I am right on the cusp.

00:54:13.090 --> 00:54:14.549
SAM: Of?

00:54:14.549 --> 00:54:17.424
LIAM: Of being able to bring you to your family.

00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:19.930
SAM: All the time?

00:54:19.930 --> 00:54:21.893
LIAM: Yeah, all the time.

00:54:22.739 --> 00:54:27.163
I haven't-- I haven't mastered it quite yet, but...

00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:32.407
SAM: Sort of like a... commute?

00:54:32.407 --> 00:54:33.980
LIAM: Yeah.

00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:35.150
Yeah, you could be a--

00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:37.063
SAM: Nights and weekends at the...

00:54:37.063 --> 00:54:40.660
LIAM: A working mom who jots off to save the world

00:54:40.660 --> 00:54:43.020
and returns home for dinner.

00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:46.362
MARISHA: I mean, it's very progressive.
SAM: I mean, that's the dream.

00:54:46.362 --> 00:54:47.533
MARISHA: It's true.

00:54:49.597 --> 00:54:50.488
SAM: Wow.
MARISHA: Yasha,

00:54:50.488 --> 00:54:53.400
what about you?

00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:58.393
I mean, we're Empire people, but where do you stand?

00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:04.987
ASHLEY: I haven't even thought that far ahead, but

00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:09.653
I don't have a home.

00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:15.203
I don't even know if my tribe is alive.

00:55:16.260 --> 00:55:19.940
And it's not like I would want to go back to them anyway.

00:55:19.940 --> 00:55:21.067
MARISHA: No?

00:55:21.925 --> 00:55:22.793
ASHLEY: No.

00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:27.570
You all are the only family that I have,

00:55:27.570 --> 00:55:29.086
so I...

00:55:32.269 --> 00:55:34.910
I want to be wherever you are,

00:55:37.270 --> 00:55:38.651
if that's okay.

00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:44.686
SAM: Have you been, forgive me prying, but

00:55:46.622 --> 00:55:49.627
have you been seeking something?

00:55:51.490 --> 00:55:56.191
You know, earlier when we had met, you kept disappearing.

00:55:58.009 --> 00:56:00.530
And even now, you toss and turn at night

00:56:00.530 --> 00:56:05.530
and it feels like you have something

00:56:06.088 --> 00:56:08.923
missing in your life

00:56:08.923 --> 00:56:11.640
and I've always been curious.

00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:15.998
I mean, what is it that your looking for?

00:56:15.998 --> 00:56:19.898
I mean, what is it that your looking for?

00:56:19.898 --> 00:56:21.430
Unless it's all just sort of a cover

00:56:21.430 --> 00:56:23.503
because you're really evil

00:56:23.503 --> 00:56:26.177
and you're going to kill us all in our sleep one day.

00:56:26.177 --> 00:56:28.105
ASHLEY: Yes, that's exactly what it is, Nott.

00:56:28.105 --> 00:56:30.078
MARISHA: Yeah, we were super convinced
of that for a little bit.

00:56:30.078 --> 00:56:33.275
LIAM: That almost happened a few times.
SAM: I'm on the fence still.

00:56:33.275 --> 00:56:36.730
ASHLEY: I'd say it still could happen, so, you know.

00:56:36.730 --> 00:56:38.271
No, um...

00:56:40.371 --> 00:56:43.487
I think I was just looking

00:56:43.487 --> 00:56:48.487
for answers, I guess.

00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:55.330
There's so much about myself that I don't know.

00:56:55.330 --> 00:56:57.938
SAM: Did you find out enough?

00:57:00.231 --> 00:57:04.610
ASHLEY: I think there's still more to find out,

00:57:04.610 --> 00:57:09.410
but I think I needed to

00:57:09.410 --> 00:57:12.176
forgive myself for a lot of things.

00:57:12.176 --> 00:57:17.167
And I think slowly I have, and

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:25.251
I feel like I have a purpose with all of you.

00:57:30.440 --> 00:57:31.565
Yeah.

00:57:37.427 --> 00:57:38.510
I don't know.

00:57:40.234 --> 00:57:45.170
LIAM: Well, plenty to focus on for the time being.

00:57:45.170 --> 00:57:48.570
SAM: Oh, yes, we have to do this thing tomorrow.

00:57:48.570 --> 00:57:49.651
LIAM: Big party.

00:57:49.651 --> 00:57:54.386
MARISHA: I'm glad we talked about this, though.

00:57:55.340 --> 00:57:57.660
Sir, sir! Bar still closed!

00:57:57.660 --> 00:57:59.140
Fuck off, please.

00:57:59.140 --> 00:58:00.780
LIAM: Yeah, but could I have another one, though?

00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:03.950
MARISHA: Fuck-- oh yeah, yeah, you.

00:58:03.950 --> 00:58:05.674
LIAM: It's closed!
ASHLEY: It's closed.

00:58:05.674 --> 00:58:08.425
This is not a bar. This is private.

00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:13.073
MATT: Fjord, is there anything you want to accomplish

00:58:13.073 --> 00:58:15.439
before the night's done or...?

00:58:15.439 --> 00:58:17.290
TRAVIS: No.
MATT: No, okay.

00:58:17.290 --> 00:58:20.640
LAURA: I want to do one last thing before the morning.

00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:24.121
I'll go somewhere where there's, like, a wall.

00:58:25.220 --> 00:58:26.820
I'm going to bust out my paints.

00:58:26.820 --> 00:58:28.378
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: My fancy paints.

00:58:28.378 --> 00:58:29.211
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: Pants?

00:58:29.211 --> 00:58:31.873
LAURA: My fancy pants, and I'm going to paint

00:58:32.710 --> 00:58:34.430
a new outfit for myself

00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:40.993
that looks more like a high priestess sort of outfit.

00:58:40.993 --> 00:58:42.470
that looks more like a high priestess sort of outfit.

00:58:42.470 --> 00:58:46.130
So, where my outfit is very dark right now,

00:58:46.130 --> 00:58:49.680
I'm going to make it a lot lighter looking.

00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:53.823
Maybe like a very, very, very pale blue, shimmery white.

00:58:54.700 --> 00:58:58.030
With lots of embroidery on it with, you know,

00:58:58.030 --> 00:58:59.840
just the tiniest little dicks mixed in,

00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:02.543
but also lots of, like, moons.

00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:06.380
Whatever I think works for the Moon Weaver.

00:59:06.380 --> 00:59:08.120
Lots of moons, maybe a couple of stars,

00:59:08.120 --> 00:59:09.900
I don't fucking know.

00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:13.854
But looks really pretty, almost like chiffon-y.

00:59:13.854 --> 00:59:15.287
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: And it's going to be

00:59:15.287 --> 00:59:18.354
fitted through here and then more of like a flowy bottom.

00:59:18.354 --> 00:59:20.940
But, like, very soft flow.
MATT: (laughs) Okay.

00:59:20.940 --> 00:59:22.650
LAURA: But I still want to wear my green cloak

00:59:22.650 --> 00:59:24.967
over top of it. I just want to paint that, then hopefully

00:59:24.967 --> 00:59:26.740
I can turn that into actual clothes.

00:59:26.740 --> 00:59:29.293
I think I can, with my paint?

00:59:30.170 --> 00:59:32.143
MATT: Yeah, you're Jester. I'll allow it.

00:59:32.654 --> 00:59:34.650
(laughter)

00:59:34.650 --> 00:59:35.970
MATT: I will be curious.

00:59:35.970 --> 00:59:38.260
Just roll a performance check for me.

00:59:38.260 --> 00:59:40.599
LIAM: That dress has more stats than a beholder.

00:59:40.599 --> 00:59:43.150
(laughter)

00:59:43.150 --> 00:59:45.200
LAURA: Performance?

00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:46.391
TRAVIS: <i>Dos</i>.

00:59:46.391 --> 00:59:47.690
LAURA: Why is it performance to paint?

00:59:47.690 --> 00:59:50.356
Why is it not, like, dexterity?
LIAM: It's art, man.

00:59:50.356 --> 00:59:52.736
MATT: Actually, if you want choose dexterity,
I'll let you choose one or the other.

00:59:52.736 --> 00:59:54.820
LAURA: Okay.
SAM: (whispering) Do performance.

00:59:55.970 --> 00:59:57.501
MATT: It's 'cause I don't want to have to be, like,

00:59:57.501 --> 01:00:01.000
well, if you have a low dexterity,
you can't draw nice, you know?

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.480
LAURA: 17.

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:04.205
MATT: 17, okay, yeah.

01:00:04.205 --> 01:00:06.002
LAURA: Oh, dammit. I already did it.

01:00:06.002 --> 01:00:07.826
Dang it, I didn't guide myself.
I should have guided myself.

01:00:07.826 --> 01:00:10.573
MATT: Well, oh well, you were
distracted with the idea in your-

01:00:10.573 --> 01:00:12.000
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: You feverishly paint.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.318
It does take a while.

01:00:13.318 --> 01:00:15.268
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: But you feel pretty...

01:00:15.268 --> 01:00:17.375
pretty proud of what you've managed to accomplish.

01:00:17.375 --> 01:00:20.180
Because of the detail involved,
the creation of the dress does--

01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:21.588
we'll say like...

01:00:23.688 --> 01:00:24.850
eight square--

01:00:24.850 --> 01:00:25.683
LAURA: Eight square?

01:00:25.683 --> 01:00:28.283
MATT: Eight square feet of paint
utilized to get the colors right,

01:00:28.283 --> 01:00:30.508
the embroidery, the details.

01:00:30.508 --> 01:00:32.449
MATT: So mark that down.
LAURA: You got it.

01:00:32.449 --> 01:00:35.680
LIAM: So glad you didn't roll a one.
I was imagining that painting of Jesus,

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:37.730
where the person tried to fix their mistake

01:00:37.730 --> 01:00:39.402
and just made the terrible face--

01:00:39.402 --> 01:00:40.326
(laughter)

01:00:40.326 --> 01:00:42.635
TRAVIS: <i>The Ring</i> girl victims.

01:00:42.635 --> 01:00:43.468
LAURA: Oh no.

01:00:43.468 --> 01:00:46.110
MATT: But as you finish the painting

01:00:46.110 --> 01:00:48.470
and it's there along the side of this wooden wall,

01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:50.270
you go ahead and reach out and grab the edges

01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:53.190
and tug it and has almost a Velcro-type sensation,

01:00:53.190 --> 01:00:55.340
as you pull it away from the wood

01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:56.490
and it comes free.

01:00:56.490 --> 01:00:59.230
As you flick it and it flows,

01:00:59.230 --> 01:01:01.496
you hear about seven different voices go:

01:01:01.496 --> 01:01:03.650
"Whoa!"

01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:05.790
And you turn around and there's a crowd of 15 people

01:01:05.790 --> 01:01:08.400
that have been just watching you while
you were engrossed in your painting.

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:11.150
The party has died down now at
this point, the fires are low.

01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:12.943
Most people have gone off to bed.

01:01:12.943 --> 01:01:15.560
But you unknowingly drew a crowd here

01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:18.170
while you were in the middle of painting
this beautiful dress against a wall

01:01:18.170 --> 01:01:22.512
and then it became real, and people are taken aback by it

01:01:22.512 --> 01:01:24.850
with big smiles, bright eyes, a couple of children.

01:01:24.850 --> 01:01:26.830
This little girl who's, like, six is looking up

01:01:26.830 --> 01:01:28.180
with these big doey eyes.

01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:29.960
And she's like: (gasp)

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:34.253
LAURA: I turn around and I curtsy very low,

01:01:34.253 --> 01:01:36.145
and I come back up and say,

01:01:37.347 --> 01:01:38.964
"Let chaos reign."

01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:41.403
MATT: "Let chaos-- let chaos reign--"

01:01:41.403 --> 01:01:43.177
They all: (clapping)

01:01:43.177 --> 01:01:46.256
LAURA: And I float away as elegantly as I can.

01:01:46.256 --> 01:01:48.940
MATT: (laughs) Okay.

01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:50.710
All right, well done.

01:01:50.710 --> 01:01:53.190
MARISHA: I-- one last thing.

01:01:53.190 --> 01:01:55.254
Where is Fjord?

01:01:55.254 --> 01:01:56.505
MATT: I don't know, where are you Fjord?

01:01:56.505 --> 01:01:58.127
MARISHA: Still chilling?

01:01:59.835 --> 01:02:01.335
TRAVIS: Yeah, no.

01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:05.102
Well, if you guys left to go commune,

01:02:06.069 --> 01:02:08.010
I think I'm just sort of keeping an eye out.

01:02:08.010 --> 01:02:11.085
So I'm not at the bar. I'm not--
I didn't follow them.

01:02:11.085 --> 01:02:12.820
Just sort of watching everyone.

01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:14.173
MARISHA: Wallflowering?
LAURA: Wandering around.

01:02:14.173 --> 01:02:16.570
TRAVIS: Yeah, I just feel like
someone's gonna start some shit.

01:02:16.570 --> 01:02:17.403
MATT: Okay.

01:02:17.403 --> 01:02:20.330
MARISHA: I-- before the bar closes down,

01:02:20.330 --> 01:02:25.190
I just pour a couple of glasses of just straight rum.

01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:26.023
MATT: Okay.

01:02:26.023 --> 01:02:27.220
MARISHA: Go find Fjord.

01:02:28.610 --> 01:02:30.643
MARISHA: Pass-- pass it around.

01:02:30.643 --> 01:02:31.870
TRAVIS: What is this?

01:02:31.870 --> 01:02:35.710
MARISHA: Rum from Kent Plucker. It's all we have.

01:02:35.710 --> 01:02:37.900
TRAVIS: Just rum, nothing else?
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm sorry.

01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:39.770
TRAVIS: No, that's actually-- I prefer that.

01:02:39.770 --> 01:02:41.780
MARISHA: Oh really?
TRAVIS: The other stuff gives me a headache.

01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:44.605
MARISHA: Yeah, the sugar. I mean, rum is so sugary.
TRAVIS: I know.

01:02:44.605 --> 01:02:46.545
MARISHA: I feel like-- it's-- it gives me--

01:02:46.545 --> 01:02:49.120
I'm going to be so hung over tomorrow.

01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:51.087
Anyway.

01:02:52.203 --> 01:02:53.036
Sup?

01:02:53.888 --> 01:02:55.400
TRAVIS: Uh-oh.

01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:57.959
MARISHA: What? I'm sorry.

01:02:57.959 --> 01:03:00.353
I just wanted to check in, you know?

01:03:01.415 --> 01:03:02.660
I've had a lot of Ruby of the Seas.

01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:04.950
(laughter)

01:03:04.950 --> 01:03:06.758
TRAVIS: I hear that's good for you.

01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:09.213
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:03:09.213 --> 01:03:11.820
So yeah, just wanted to check in, though,

01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:13.440
because, like, you know,

01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:17.350
I look up to you a lot

01:03:17.350 --> 01:03:19.568
and like, you know, admire you.

01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:24.161
I don't know, like,

01:03:24.161 --> 01:03:27.540
conversation came up, like, an hour ago about, like,

01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:28.850
what are we all going to do?

01:03:28.850 --> 01:03:30.638
And you know,

01:03:30.638 --> 01:03:35.638
there was, like, some, like, dream-- not dreams, not-- uh--

01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:39.740
There was, like, a reality that I kind of thought of,

01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:42.960
of, like, sailing the sea with you, you know,

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:46.260
and being like first mate, captain,

01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:49.830
but then also, like, still an expositor.

01:03:49.830 --> 01:03:51.960
So I was like, maybe I can combine that

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:55.664
and be, like, an expositor-pirate.

01:03:55.664 --> 01:03:56.670
TRAVIS: Ooh, hybrid.

01:03:56.670 --> 01:03:58.320
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:00.400
MARISHA: But that also feels like, you know,

01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:05.225
a Hallow's Eve costume in a way and not, like, a real job.

01:04:05.225 --> 01:04:06.091
MARISHA: I don't know.

01:04:06.091 --> 01:04:07.850
TRAVIS: Do you have obligations that you have to meet

01:04:07.850 --> 01:04:12.060
as an expositor, like a yearly quota
you have to meet or anything?

01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:13.580
MARISHA: I don't really know.

01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:15.177
They kind of made me an Expositor

01:04:15.177 --> 01:04:18.070
and then I've just been fucking off with you guys,

01:04:18.070 --> 01:04:19.640
but I think I've been, like, doing things

01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:21.140
and, like, we've been making a difference,

01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:26.060
so they're not, like, checking me on any shit.

01:04:26.060 --> 01:04:26.893
TRAVIS: Right.

01:04:26.893 --> 01:04:30.700
MARISHA: So-- but also, like, I don't know.

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:32.910
TRAVIS: We totally have been making a difference by the way.

01:04:32.910 --> 01:04:34.793
You're absolutely right. We have.

01:04:34.793 --> 01:04:35.792
MARISHA: We have?

01:04:35.792 --> 01:04:38.451
TRAVIS: I feel the same way. Yes, of course!
MARISHA: Okay.

01:04:38.451 --> 01:04:41.420
TRAVIS: I don't know what you were doing
before this, but I was doing fuck-all.

01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:43.440
MARISHA: Oh, it was a disaster.

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:46.010
TRAVIS: I feel like we've all made more of an impact

01:04:46.010 --> 01:04:48.610
than we ever would if we hadn't met each other.

01:04:48.610 --> 01:04:49.443
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:53.473
TRAVIS: You said there was a conversation going on about what,

01:04:54.730 --> 01:04:56.450
what the plan is?

01:04:56.450 --> 01:04:57.810
MARISHA: I-- yeah, I dunno.

01:04:57.810 --> 01:05:02.810
Just about, like, life after Mighty Nein, you know?

01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:03.890
TRAVIS: Oh.

01:05:03.890 --> 01:05:05.380
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:06.213
TRAVIS: It's so weird.

01:05:06.213 --> 01:05:08.250
I don't have the answer to that. That's a big question.

01:05:08.250 --> 01:05:11.050
I had a similar conversation with Jester earlier this week

01:05:11.050 --> 01:05:11.883
and she was asking.
MARISHA: Really?

01:05:11.883 --> 01:05:13.590
TRAVIS: Yeah, all of this stuff about gods

01:05:13.590 --> 01:05:14.750
and what happens when you die.

01:05:14.750 --> 01:05:17.023
And I--

01:05:17.023 --> 01:05:19.410
I don't know if I give off some sort of a sense

01:05:19.410 --> 01:05:21.705
of knowing shit.
MARISHA: You kind of do, yeah.

01:05:21.705 --> 01:05:22.788
TRAVIS: I really don't.

01:05:22.788 --> 01:05:26.280
MARISHA: You're just, you got, like,
a gravitas about you, you know?

01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:27.824
TRAVIS: It is a <i>lie</i>.

01:05:27.824 --> 01:05:29.600
MARISHA: I mean, it works, so whatever you're doing,

01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:31.533
just keep doing it.

01:05:31.533 --> 01:05:32.489
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:05:32.489 --> 01:05:34.503
MARISHA: So, Jester, though.

01:05:34.503 --> 01:05:35.867
TRAVIS: Here it comes.

01:05:35.867 --> 01:05:37.100
(laughter)

01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:39.843
I was wondering where that melodic intro was going to hit.

01:05:42.099 --> 01:05:43.450
J--Jester?

01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:48.290
MARISHA: You know what I'm going to ask, dude, right?

01:05:48.290 --> 01:05:49.342
Like, what's the deal?

01:05:49.342 --> 01:05:50.649
TRAVIS: When you come with the "dude," yes,

01:05:50.649 --> 01:05:53.113
I think I know what you're going to ask.

01:05:55.470 --> 01:05:58.038
What-- what about Jester?

01:06:06.121 --> 01:06:07.960
MARISHA: You know how she feels about you

01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:09.160
or at least how she did?

01:06:10.033 --> 01:06:11.660
I don't know if she still does.

01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:12.750
TRAVIS: I don't either.

01:06:12.750 --> 01:06:15.122
I have no idea.

01:06:15.122 --> 01:06:16.155
I am...

01:06:17.021 --> 01:06:20.946
probably the least clued in as to how Jester feels.

01:06:20.946 --> 01:06:24.043
I've actually tried to ask, but I don't know.

01:06:25.090 --> 01:06:27.640
MARISHA: You have to be direct with Jester, though.

01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:29.343
Like, you can't--
TRAVIS: For sure.

01:06:29.343 --> 01:06:32.683
MARISHA: -- like, beat around the bush.
So if you were trying to, like, sidestep it,

01:06:32.683 --> 01:06:34.040
that might've gone over her head.

01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:38.606
TRAVIS: I get that. It's just that there are more...

01:06:38.606 --> 01:06:41.140
pressing matters at hand.

01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:41.973
And...

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:47.200
I feel like I'm the fourth version of myself

01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:49.107
since I left Port Damali.

01:06:50.410 --> 01:06:52.390
And I feel like it could change again

01:06:52.390 --> 01:06:55.786
in a month or three months.

01:06:55.786 --> 01:06:58.600
I feel as if the ground is shifting underneath my feet

01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:01.230
every few nights that I wake up

01:07:01.230 --> 01:07:05.150
and it's crazy. I actually love it.

01:07:05.150 --> 01:07:07.710
Because it's all been for the better,
no matter how crazy it's been.

01:07:07.710 --> 01:07:11.510
But what I wanted when this all began

01:07:12.510 --> 01:07:15.650
is so far in the past, I can't--

01:07:15.650 --> 01:07:17.520
I forget about it sometimes.

01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:20.770
It comes for me in the middle of the night, even.

01:07:20.770 --> 01:07:21.603
But...

01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:27.063
Jester's hard to ignore.

01:07:28.370 --> 01:07:31.710
MARISHA: Yeah, no, I know. I'm pretty certain

01:07:31.710 --> 01:07:35.860
literally everyone has a crush on her.

01:07:35.860 --> 01:07:36.990
TRAVIS: What?

01:07:36.990 --> 01:07:39.240
MARISHA: Like, at least all of Mighty Nein.

01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:42.890
I don't know though, but I'm pretty
sure everyone she meets is, like,

01:07:42.890 --> 01:07:44.890
"Well I'd maybe kill for you, yeah."

01:07:44.890 --> 01:07:48.061
TRAVIS: Oh yes, no, that I totally agree with. Yeah.

01:07:48.061 --> 01:07:49.911
Yeah. No, I--

01:07:50.886 --> 01:07:52.419
Where is she?

01:07:52.419 --> 01:07:54.798
MARISHA: I don't fucking know. I don't know.

01:07:57.437 --> 01:07:59.820
MATT: With your high wisdom, you
would look over and see across the way,

01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:02.500
she's partway through painting a dress on a wall.

01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:03.792
MARISHA: Fuck if I know, man.

01:08:04.776 --> 01:08:05.817
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

01:08:08.030 --> 01:08:09.080
Do I see Jester?

01:08:09.990 --> 01:08:12.997
MATT: With your passive perception this far away, no.

01:08:12.997 --> 01:08:14.325
TRAVIS: Fucking figures.

01:08:14.325 --> 01:08:16.240
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:17.073
TRAVIS: I--

01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:24.881
You know when someone makes you feel a way

01:08:24.881 --> 01:08:29.402
that you don't think you have any right to feel

01:08:29.402 --> 01:08:31.523
or you never thought that you might?

01:08:32.590 --> 01:08:33.680
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:38.180
TRAVIS: And that seems off because I should know who I am.

01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:40.490
I should know how I feel or what I want,

01:08:40.490 --> 01:08:45.490
but there's a gravity around Jester,

01:08:45.548 --> 01:08:46.948
at least to me.

01:08:46.948 --> 01:08:49.530
And she's the one I've known the longest

01:08:49.530 --> 01:08:53.270
in this new part of my life.

01:08:53.270 --> 01:08:56.910
And I really thought that when this started,

01:08:56.910 --> 01:08:59.470
there would be an end for me in this

01:08:59.470 --> 01:09:00.860
and I would get even,

01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:05.110
or retribution or payback and then I would be...

01:09:06.443 --> 01:09:07.276
done.

01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:10.770
And it hasn't been that way at all.

01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:14.120
It shriveled up and died and in its place,

01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:17.429
seven new interests sprouted, and--

01:09:21.216 --> 01:09:24.771
MARISHA: I mean, I think part of
the reason we all set off to Zadash

01:09:24.771 --> 01:09:29.530
was to go search out the Soltryce Academy for you.

01:09:29.530 --> 01:09:31.850
TRAVIS: Yeah, I wanted to go to school there.

01:09:31.850 --> 01:09:34.191
MARISHA: How crazy-- you wanted to go to college!

01:09:34.191 --> 01:09:36.953
TRAVIS: Fucking stupid.
MARISHA: Nuts, yeah.

01:09:39.170 --> 01:09:41.220
TRAVIS: I mean, I really feel like an idiot about

01:09:41.220 --> 01:09:43.860
when I think about what I was saying to Caleb back then.

01:09:43.860 --> 01:09:46.008
Dense, ooh!

01:09:48.510 --> 01:09:50.003
I--

01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:52.750
MARISHA: None of us knew any better.

01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:57.730
TRAVIS: I-- I want Jester to be happy.

01:09:57.730 --> 01:10:01.820
I do feel very strongly for her,

01:10:01.820 --> 01:10:06.805
but I also know that when this all began,

01:10:07.660 --> 01:10:10.560
her affections might've been based entirely on whimsy.

01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:11.393
I don't know.

01:10:11.393 --> 01:10:16.250
I-- and I don't really feel like asking either.

01:10:16.250 --> 01:10:19.543
I almost don't want to know,

01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:21.523
just like it.

01:10:23.430 --> 01:10:26.263
And to me, as long as she's all right,

01:10:27.250 --> 01:10:30.340
it seems like this is not a permanent thing.

01:10:30.340 --> 01:10:32.770
It's not like we were going to leave here on this island.

01:10:32.770 --> 01:10:35.060
And then we would just go off,
which I was worried about before.

01:10:35.060 --> 01:10:39.720
But it sounds like it's all for show

01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:43.760
and we might be the Nein again, after all this.

01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:45.900
And then I don't know what.

01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:48.790
I want to explore the world.

01:10:48.790 --> 01:10:50.360
I want to see the lands we haven't seen.

01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:53.030
I want to find the things that people are scared of

01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:55.680
and solve them or do whatever anyone else needs to do.

01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:56.630
But--

01:10:59.310 --> 01:11:02.630
I hope she's a part of that.

01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:06.956
MARISHA: Me, too.

01:11:09.230 --> 01:11:12.510
You talking about being four different versions

01:11:12.510 --> 01:11:13.670
of yourself since you left.

01:11:13.670 --> 01:11:17.670
I think there's been four different versions of Jester and

01:11:19.403 --> 01:11:21.478
four different versions of...

01:11:22.486 --> 01:11:24.294
all of us, really.

01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:28.890
I think I'm just...

01:11:33.470 --> 01:11:36.540
comforted knowing that we all have

01:11:36.540 --> 01:11:38.715
these underlying thoughts.

01:11:41.050 --> 01:11:41.883
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:44.163
By the way,

01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:46.983
speaking of.

01:11:46.983 --> 01:11:48.397
MARISHA: Oh shit!

01:11:48.397 --> 01:11:52.062
TRAVIS: Oh, bringing it back, bringing it back.

01:11:52.062 --> 01:11:54.102
What the fuck with the flight with Yasha?

01:11:54.102 --> 01:11:55.352
MARISHA: Dude.

01:11:56.235 --> 01:11:57.068
Dude.

01:11:57.068 --> 01:11:59.918
TRAVIS: I mean, come on.
You were red head to toe.

01:12:01.420 --> 01:12:03.220
MARISHA: So I definitely had a crush on Jester,

01:12:03.220 --> 01:12:05.230
just since we're, like, drunk and--

01:12:05.230 --> 01:12:06.153
TRAVIS: When you said it before,

01:12:06.153 --> 01:12:07.990
it was like a thing. You had a real crush on Jester?

01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:10.240
MARISHA: Well, I'm pretty-- she's so enigmatic,

01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:13.187
like you said, and she just, like,

01:12:13.187 --> 01:12:17.718
she's got this way of just when she talks.

01:12:17.718 --> 01:12:20.150
TRAVIS: I'm talking Yasha.
You can go back to Yasha, it's--

01:12:20.150 --> 01:12:22.583
MARISHA: No, but I mean, but the-- it--

01:12:24.108 --> 01:12:26.599
kind of transfers in a way.

01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:35.640
I swore off Yasha because she's got her own shit

01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:36.750
she's got to deal with, you know.

01:12:36.750 --> 01:12:38.960
She's, like, mourning her wife.

01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:43.362
So I can't be like that asshole who comes in and is like--

01:12:43.362 --> 01:12:47.692
No one wants to be the rebound, you know?
TRAVIS: I feel you, a hundred percent.

01:12:47.692 --> 01:12:49.203
MARISHA: So it's-- I don't know.

01:12:49.203 --> 01:12:50.410
I'm--

01:12:50.410 --> 01:12:53.527
TRAVIS: We are all so fucked up, it's crazy.
MARISHA: We're so fucked up.

01:12:53.527 --> 01:12:55.650
TRAVIS: It's like a bunch of jigsaw puzzles
that have no matching pieces.

01:12:55.650 --> 01:12:58.800
You just like get them really wet
and shoved those shits together.

01:12:58.800 --> 01:12:59.733
Like, "It fits!"

01:12:59.733 --> 01:13:02.330
MARISHA: I mentioned earlier to Ca--

01:13:02.330 --> 01:13:04.625
I think he went to bed-- to Caleb.

01:13:04.625 --> 01:13:08.220
I think we're all super codependent on each other

01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:11.520
and I'm kind of here for that.

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:14.838
Super comfortable in that.

01:13:14.838 --> 01:13:15.754
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:13:15.754 --> 01:13:16.587
MARISHA: So.

01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:21.502
I don't know, you think Yasha
likes me though? You think she's like--

01:13:21.502 --> 01:13:25.413
you think there's like-- I mean, when she like-- you know.

01:13:25.413 --> 01:13:27.030
TRAVIS: Yasha's not really

01:13:27.030 --> 01:13:28.961
easy to read.
MARISHA: No.

01:13:28.961 --> 01:13:31.078
TRAVIS: But you know, for the little that she says,

01:13:31.078 --> 01:13:35.908
it certainly seemed like she was, I don't know, flustered.

01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:42.280
MARISHA: I think-- it's easy to
lust after Jester because she's...

01:13:44.315 --> 01:13:47.956
sparkles and confetti and shiny.

01:13:49.030 --> 01:13:52.040
There was something about Yasha from the moment

01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:53.600
that I saw her...

01:13:58.453 --> 01:14:00.720
that I think I've been avoiding.

01:14:03.075 --> 01:14:04.158
I don't know.

01:14:05.984 --> 01:14:09.400
TRAVIS: Something of more sustenance that's not as...

01:14:10.709 --> 01:14:11.880
fleeting?

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:13.510
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:14:13.510 --> 01:14:15.056
Yeah.

01:14:15.056 --> 01:14:16.256
TRAVIS: Ooh.

01:14:18.527 --> 01:14:22.843
MARISHA: But I guess we'll see
what happens tomorrow. Traveler Con!

01:14:22.843 --> 01:14:24.059
Woo!

01:14:25.019 --> 01:14:26.595
All right, goodnight, Fjord.

01:14:27.870 --> 01:14:29.710
TRAVIS: You're going to leave me with this ra--?

01:14:29.710 --> 01:14:31.419
MARISHA: And I walk away.

01:14:31.419 --> 01:14:33.217
(laughter)

01:14:33.217 --> 01:14:34.467
LIAM: There you go.

01:14:35.530 --> 01:14:36.838
SAM: Goodnight!

01:14:39.430 --> 01:14:40.980
TRAVIS: I drink my rum.

01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:42.157
MATT: All right.

01:14:42.157 --> 01:14:44.407
(laughter)

01:14:45.810 --> 01:14:48.690
You all eventually come to the chamber

01:14:48.690 --> 01:14:50.860
that is no longer Vilya's.

01:14:50.860 --> 01:14:53.345
A comfortable interior room.

01:14:54.328 --> 01:14:57.100
Of which Veth probably notifies you all that

01:14:57.100 --> 01:15:02.093
she took her leave, but gave her best to you all.

01:15:03.584 --> 01:15:06.324
SAM: And the keys to her apartment.

01:15:06.324 --> 01:15:08.051
MATT: (chuckles)

01:15:09.918 --> 01:15:12.060
So you get a night's rest here on this Traveler Eve.

01:15:12.060 --> 01:15:16.130
Dreams of excitement and anxiety

01:15:16.130 --> 01:15:19.523
for what the day to come may hold.

01:15:20.610 --> 01:15:23.903
Dreams of family and longing.

01:15:25.330 --> 01:15:27.813
Dreams of lost family and new.

01:15:30.390 --> 01:15:34.130
Dreams of a life after

01:15:36.685 --> 01:15:39.393
the run and the chase.

01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:46.250
Dreams of being free of...

01:15:47.917 --> 01:15:50.076
poor decisions once and for all.

01:15:53.930 --> 01:15:54.850
Dreams of...

01:15:56.910 --> 01:15:59.510
making something of yourself that you never thought,

01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:02.458
anybody else that you could.

01:16:04.670 --> 01:16:08.440
Dreams of restoring a life

01:16:11.565 --> 01:16:15.818
that which your family had been promised to keep.

01:16:19.007 --> 01:16:21.190
But then, Caduceus, in those dreams still--

01:16:21.190 --> 01:16:22.023
TALIESIN: Yep.

01:16:22.930 --> 01:16:24.980
MATT: Bending cobblestone.

01:16:26.460 --> 01:16:30.435
Walls that see and scream.

01:16:34.420 --> 01:16:35.463
Looking down

01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:40.660
alleyways that curve into an impossible curvature.

01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:45.635
Still unsettled.

01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:49.470
Something hooked you in that.

01:16:52.833 --> 01:16:56.320
But the morning comes to you all,

01:16:56.320 --> 01:17:01.060
somewhat muggy and a cloudy day greets you.

01:17:01.060 --> 01:17:04.090
The jungle heat and humidity makes for an already sticky

01:17:04.090 --> 01:17:05.050
and uncomfortable morning.

01:17:05.050 --> 01:17:08.400
But you hear the exterior chatter of a large crowd of people

01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:10.600
that have come to, excited.

01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:12.610
As you glance out through the entryway

01:17:12.610 --> 01:17:14.853
that leads into the thoroughfare of the village of Vo,

01:17:14.853 --> 01:17:17.399
you can see there are numerous green cloaks.

01:17:17.399 --> 01:17:21.080
You can see individuals getting pieces of cake

01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:22.350
and treats that have been prepared

01:17:22.350 --> 01:17:24.570
and brought from wherever else they came from.

01:17:24.570 --> 01:17:27.830
A multitude of colors and faces all around you

01:17:27.830 --> 01:17:30.820
as music begins to burble up from below,

01:17:30.820 --> 01:17:35.378
different, in some cases conflicting themes.

01:17:35.378 --> 01:17:39.003
But nevertheless, there is a palpable
excitement in the morning

01:17:39.003 --> 01:17:41.830
and a number of you are very hungover,

01:17:41.830 --> 01:17:43.660
but you soldier through it,

01:17:43.660 --> 01:17:45.290
except for you, 'cause you're immune to poison.

01:17:45.290 --> 01:17:46.837
TALIESIN: Oh and I'm fine, I didn't have anything to drink.

01:17:46.837 --> 01:17:48.410
TRAVIS: Immune to poison!

01:17:48.410 --> 01:17:52.080
MARISHA: He was talking to me, but you, too.

01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:54.660
MATT: Yeah, you're fine.
TALIESIN: I'm great, I'm already--

01:17:54.660 --> 01:17:57.460
MATT: Caleb, your head is pounding.

01:17:57.460 --> 01:17:59.334
MARISHA: Saturday at Comic Con.

01:17:59.334 --> 01:18:01.930
(laughter)

01:18:01.930 --> 01:18:03.737
MATT: Oh, yeah.
MARISHA: Went too hard on Friday night,

01:18:03.737 --> 01:18:07.587
and we have Saturday to go, two more days.
TRAVIS: Irish breakfast, come on.

01:18:07.587 --> 01:18:09.700
MARISHA: Yeah, Irish breakfast, let's go.

01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:10.940
TRAVIS: Get it in me.

01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:13.586
MARISHA: Irish coffee to help the day.

01:18:13.586 --> 01:18:15.340
MATT: You can taste that last drink when you wake up.

01:18:15.340 --> 01:18:17.810
TRAVIS: Ooh, Matthew.

01:18:17.810 --> 01:18:19.560
MARISHA: Let's go do a panel.
TRAVIS: Too real.

01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:23.875
LIAM: Not this year.
MATT: But the day is yours.

01:18:23.875 --> 01:18:25.769
What would you like to do?

01:18:25.769 --> 01:18:27.700
LAURA: I make sure everybody has their cloaks.

01:18:27.700 --> 01:18:29.820
You guys are all-- you're good?

01:18:29.820 --> 01:18:31.108
I know it's hot outside,

01:18:31.108 --> 01:18:33.650
but to keep it on to really make everyone think

01:18:33.650 --> 01:18:35.450
we're all high priests.

01:18:35.450 --> 01:18:37.656
ASHLEY: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

01:18:37.656 --> 01:18:40.707
LAURA: Oh yeah, I put mine on too, okay.

01:18:40.707 --> 01:18:42.560
TALIESIN: I didn't bring mine.

01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:45.344
LAURA: That's okay, Caduceus.
SAM: It's okay, your hair is a cloak.

01:18:48.250 --> 01:18:49.655
MATT: All right.
ASHLEY: It's hot.

01:18:49.655 --> 01:18:51.270
LAURA: It is very warm.
TRAVIS: It's hot as fuck.

01:18:51.270 --> 01:18:52.724
MARISHA: The back of my neck is sweating.

01:18:52.724 --> 01:18:54.767
TRAVIS: Burbank summer's some horseshit.

01:18:54.767 --> 01:18:55.600
MATT: Yep.

01:18:56.660 --> 01:18:59.887
LAURA: Okay, so I was thinking
what we'd start with is Yasha.

01:18:59.887 --> 01:19:00.720
ASHLEY: Uh--

01:19:02.081 --> 01:19:04.880
(laughter)

01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:06.800
ASHLEY: It's the frothy bits.

01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:08.050
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:19:08.050 --> 01:19:10.540
ASHLEY: Yeah, I feel like I taste it right around here.

01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:13.547
LAURA: I wouldn't have trusted it if I were you, that's--

01:19:13.547 --> 01:19:15.290
I mean, how long those eggs been here, you know?

01:19:15.290 --> 01:19:17.300
ASHLEY: Yeah, that's true.

01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:20.217
TRAVIS: They weren't eggs.
ASHLEY: It's fine. It was worth it.

01:19:22.580 --> 01:19:24.530
LAURA: Okay, so start with the Yasha concert.

01:19:24.530 --> 01:19:25.450
ASHLEY: Yeah, okay.

01:19:25.450 --> 01:19:28.550
LAURA: Then we'll do a little, you know--

01:19:28.550 --> 01:19:32.607
I'll come after you do the intro, like opening act.

01:19:32.607 --> 01:19:34.772
ASHLEY: Okay.
LAURA: I'll come out.

01:19:34.772 --> 01:19:35.932
I'll give a speech.

01:19:35.932 --> 01:19:37.808
MARISHA: Okay.

01:19:37.808 --> 01:19:39.370
LAURA: And then, you know,

01:19:39.370 --> 01:19:42.750
commence the festivities. Everyone scatter

01:19:42.750 --> 01:19:44.760
and start their dick hunt.

01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:46.260
Yeah?
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

01:19:46.260 --> 01:19:48.226
LAURA: And then...

01:19:49.334 --> 01:19:52.417
once everyone finds their dick, then we can

01:19:52.417 --> 01:19:55.730
start the trek up to the volcano, yeah?

01:19:55.730 --> 01:19:59.470
ASHLEY: Do you have a specific kind
of song you'd like me to play?

01:19:59.470 --> 01:20:02.223
Like something uplifting, something...?

01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:08.160
LAURA: Can you start with something like, you know,

01:20:08.265 --> 01:20:11.250
dark and kind of moony, you know?

01:20:11.250 --> 01:20:13.540
ASHLEY: Something dark and moony?
LAURA: Yeah.

01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:14.680
ASHLEY: Okay, I have some ideas.

01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:17.710
LAURA: As it goes and people start to gather,

01:20:17.710 --> 01:20:20.950
then you can get more jaunty and, like, epic.

01:20:20.950 --> 01:20:23.460
ASHLEY: Love it. Dark, moony, and jaunty.

01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:25.000
LAURA: (laughs) Yeah, and then--

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.570
ASHLEY: I know exactly what to play.

01:20:26.570 --> 01:20:29.300
LAURA: And then finish off with something like buh!

01:20:29.300 --> 01:20:31.570
And then right when it's buh! That's when I'll--

01:20:31.570 --> 01:20:34.630
Caleb, if you could do some cool chh effect.

01:20:34.630 --> 01:20:36.553
LIAM: Yeah, of course. I could do that.

01:20:36.553 --> 01:20:38.148
LAURA: Yeah, as soon as she does her final chh

01:20:38.148 --> 01:20:40.523
and then you do an effect and then I'll come on stage.

01:20:40.523 --> 01:20:41.750
LIAM: Okay.

01:20:41.750 --> 01:20:43.000
And then when I come on stage,

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.812
then everybody else should probably like--

01:20:45.812 --> 01:20:47.980
MARISHA: (light claps)
LAURA: Yeah, start clapping 'cause, like,

01:20:47.980 --> 01:20:49.580
so that everyone knows that I'm, like,

01:20:49.580 --> 01:20:51.620
the high priestess and stuff.
SAM: Do you need to be introduced

01:20:51.620 --> 01:20:54.460
or will you just come out after the song is over?

01:20:54.460 --> 01:20:57.170
LAURA: Oh, that's a good idea. Do you want to introduce me?

01:20:57.170 --> 01:20:58.845
SAM: Me? Uh, sure.

01:20:58.845 --> 01:21:01.077
Yep.
LAURA: Okay, so, buh!

01:21:01.077 --> 01:21:03.270
Veth will come out, introduce me.

01:21:03.270 --> 01:21:04.760
And then I'll come on stage.

01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:09.213
SAM: Is there-- you're just the high
priestess of the Traveler so far?

01:21:09.213 --> 01:21:10.396
LAURA: Still the Traveler.

01:21:10.396 --> 01:21:13.220
That's the trick we're going to reveal later.

01:21:13.220 --> 01:21:16.890
I feel like we'll probably do the Moon Weaver reveal

01:21:16.890 --> 01:21:20.210
after everybody gets up to the volcano.

01:21:20.210 --> 01:21:21.680
We throw our stuff in

01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:23.150
and then the Traveler's going to

01:21:23.150 --> 01:21:25.466
do some (horn blowing) and he's going to ascend

01:21:25.466 --> 01:21:26.833
and then buh-bam!

01:21:26.833 --> 01:21:29.690
And then maybe Fjord, you can do this big visual thing,

01:21:29.690 --> 01:21:33.390
because we're not going to have a moon! (nervous laugh)

01:21:33.390 --> 01:21:34.410
There's not going to be a moon.

01:21:34.410 --> 01:21:36.530
So if you could make a cool firework

01:21:36.530 --> 01:21:37.900
or something that all of a sudden

01:21:37.900 --> 01:21:39.800
transforms into the moon,

01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:41.620
like a really big full moon.

01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:43.981
LIAM: You need a moon?

01:21:45.020 --> 01:21:46.941
Do you need a moon?

01:21:46.941 --> 01:21:50.594
LAURA: Like, what do you mean, you can make a moon?
LIAM: Sorry, my face really hurts a lot.

01:21:50.594 --> 01:21:52.554
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, no. She needs a moon. I know this one.

01:21:52.554 --> 01:21:53.393
LAURA: Yeah, I need a moon.

01:21:53.393 --> 01:21:55.730
LIAM: Well, I think I could work something out

01:21:55.730 --> 01:21:57.510
with a bit of forced perspective

01:21:57.510 --> 01:22:01.176
and throw-- if the crowd is in a relatively

01:22:02.409 --> 01:22:03.792
congregated space,

01:22:03.792 --> 01:22:06.818
I could create a moon above us

01:22:07.784 --> 01:22:11.249
that would appear as if it was where it should be.

01:22:11.249 --> 01:22:12.870
LAURA: I love it!

01:22:12.870 --> 01:22:14.920
Yeah, do that!
LIAM: And we could gussy it up

01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:16.861
and make it feel a little...

01:22:16.861 --> 01:22:18.697
something special.
LAURA: Extra fancy,

01:22:18.697 --> 01:22:20.954
like the Moon Weaver's really looking down on us

01:22:20.954 --> 01:22:22.950
and is proud of us.
LIAM: Yeah

01:22:22.950 --> 01:22:24.852
Are we doing the big moon or the little moon?

01:22:24.852 --> 01:22:26.913
LAURA: The big moon.
LIAM: The big moon.

01:22:26.913 --> 01:22:28.029
Okay.

01:22:29.177 --> 01:22:32.525
And no-- we're done with the penis motif.

01:22:32.525 --> 01:22:33.800
Now it is just straight moons?

01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:36.190
LAURA: After the penises go in the volcano

01:22:36.190 --> 01:22:38.774
then penis motif is doneskis.

01:22:38.774 --> 01:22:40.570
Onto moon.
TRAVIS: (laughs)

01:22:40.570 --> 01:22:41.403
MARISHA: Okay.

01:22:41.403 --> 01:22:42.236
LAURA: Yeah.

01:22:42.236 --> 01:22:43.069
LIAM: Okay.

01:22:43.069 --> 01:22:45.920
MARISHA: And the Traveler knows all of his cues?

01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:47.903
He knows the plan?

01:22:48.816 --> 01:22:50.210
LAURA: I have not told him anything,

01:22:50.210 --> 01:22:52.400
but he's really good at picking things up.

01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:53.233
MARISHA: Okay?

01:22:53.233 --> 01:22:55.920
LAURA: We did this all the time. He knows. It's like--

01:22:55.920 --> 01:22:57.570
we work well off each other.

01:22:57.570 --> 01:23:00.180
LIAM: So he's going to wing it like jazz

01:23:00.180 --> 01:23:03.100
off of what you have planned with us?

01:23:03.100 --> 01:23:04.000
LAURA: Yeah.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:04.833
MARISHA: Okay.

01:23:04.833 --> 01:23:07.960
Well, I have a full itinerary that I have--

01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:11.306
I have a deep schedule and he's going to wing it.

01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:14.348
LAURA: Well, they are his followers.

01:23:14.348 --> 01:23:15.181
MARISHA: Yeah!

01:23:15.181 --> 01:23:16.960
Yeah, no, he's got it.

01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:19.250
LAURA: It's really hot in this cloak.

01:23:19.250 --> 01:23:20.150
MARISHA: He's talented.

01:23:20.150 --> 01:23:22.700
So hot in this cloak.

01:23:22.700 --> 01:23:24.260
Cloaks in the jungle, why did we?

01:23:24.260 --> 01:23:26.110
LAURA: Yeah, didn't think about that.

01:23:27.248 --> 01:23:29.240
If you guys want to rip the sleeves off your cloaks,

01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:30.440
that's totally fine.

01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:31.273
TRAVIS: Sleeves are bullshit.

01:23:31.273 --> 01:23:33.380
ASHLEY: A sleeveless cloak.
TALIESIN: These cloaks have sleeves?

01:23:33.380 --> 01:23:34.907
ASHLEY: Sleeves are bullshit.

01:23:34.907 --> 01:23:36.910
LAURA: I don't know, do they?

01:23:36.910 --> 01:23:38.880
Maybe cut a hole in the sides of it?

01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:41.200
I-- maybe it's just a cloak that goes over.

01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:44.416
Yeah, cut holes so your arms can poke out the sides.

01:23:45.717 --> 01:23:48.420
MATT: As you make your way down to the main village,

01:23:48.420 --> 01:23:49.440
having this conversation,

01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:53.160
you can see elements of the crowd have splintered off

01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:56.120
into small groups and you can see there's some people

01:23:56.120 --> 01:23:59.070
who are orating about an experience,

01:23:59.070 --> 01:24:02.255
whether it be their story of how they met the Traveler or

01:24:02.255 --> 01:24:05.091
tips and tricks on various tricks they've done.

01:24:05.940 --> 01:24:09.050
Small panels, if you will, have broken off

01:24:09.050 --> 01:24:09.983
into different aspects.

01:24:09.983 --> 01:24:13.848
People are having gatherings and discussions.

01:24:13.848 --> 01:24:15.773
Food is being cooked.

01:24:15.773 --> 01:24:20.198
You can hear the faint beginnings of a few musicians

01:24:20.198 --> 01:24:22.878
starting to tune up and prepare for the day's playing.

01:24:23.845 --> 01:24:26.130
But there is largely no organization to this.

01:24:26.130 --> 01:24:27.690
Everyone's just doing their own thing

01:24:27.690 --> 01:24:29.933
and waiting for someone to take point.

01:24:29.933 --> 01:24:31.040
LAURA: Good, good.

01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:32.763
Yasha will get the gathering happening

01:24:32.763 --> 01:24:33.660
with the music and stuff.

01:24:33.660 --> 01:24:35.918
ASHLEY: Okay, should I-- should I start?

01:24:37.224 --> 01:24:39.460
LAURA: I mean, you don't want to go too early, you know,

01:24:39.460 --> 01:24:42.090
but once it seems like-- yeah, sure, go.

01:24:42.090 --> 01:24:45.501
MARISHA: That's true. What time is it?
LAURA: What time is it?

01:24:45.501 --> 01:24:47.900
MATT: At this point-- yes.

01:24:47.900 --> 01:24:49.750
At this point it'd be probably at 10:30.

01:24:49.750 --> 01:24:51.250
You guys kind of slept in

01:24:51.250 --> 01:24:52.310
for those who were drinking heavily.

01:24:52.310 --> 01:24:53.740
Not too bad, not too bad.

01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:55.282
LAURA: That's a good start.

01:24:57.250 --> 01:24:59.180
MARISHA: 10:30. Keynote at 11?

01:24:59.180 --> 01:25:01.072
LAURA: Mm.
MARISHA: Okay, all right, cool.

01:25:02.299 --> 01:25:03.810
MATT: So the stage is completed.

01:25:04.968 --> 01:25:06.020
And there, you know,

01:25:06.020 --> 01:25:08.400
you can see Kent Plucker and a handful of other figures

01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:12.260
that are all tuning instruments, getting warmed up,

01:25:12.260 --> 01:25:16.340
but you can see they're all not a cohesive group.

01:25:16.340 --> 01:25:17.420
They're all eyeing each other,

01:25:17.420 --> 01:25:18.550
like who's going to finish

01:25:18.550 --> 01:25:20.360
tuning up first and take the stage first.

01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:23.312
And they're all having this subtle

01:25:23.312 --> 01:25:25.585
eyeline duel between each other.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.700
LAURA: Can somebody do a cool light effect or something

01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:32.400
so that everyone looks at the stage

01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:33.860
when Yasha gets up there?

01:25:33.860 --> 01:25:34.878
TRAVIS: I don't have a job.

01:25:34.878 --> 01:25:37.364
I could just ...
(southern accent) Eldritch Blast!

01:25:37.364 --> 01:25:39.857
(explosions)

01:25:39.857 --> 01:25:41.523
MATT: Do you do that?
TRAVIS: Yup.

01:25:41.523 --> 01:25:43.441
MATT: You watch as all of a sudden,
the nearby crowd of people

01:25:43.441 --> 01:25:44.930
start looking up going, "Whoa, what?"

01:25:44.930 --> 01:25:47.397
And they all look over in your direction.

01:25:47.397 --> 01:25:48.888
TRAVIS: Oh, were we ready yet?

01:25:49.868 --> 01:25:52.050
LAURA: Yasha, go, go, go!

01:25:52.050 --> 01:25:53.856
SAM: Places, please. Action.

01:25:53.856 --> 01:25:55.133
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:25:57.200 --> 01:25:59.157
So I will go up on the stage.

01:25:59.157 --> 01:26:03.032
MARISHA: (applause and cheering)
LAURA: (applause) Yasha!

01:26:03.032 --> 01:26:04.920
MATT: Interesting point.

01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:06.350
As you step up onto the stage

01:26:06.350 --> 01:26:07.610
and hear the voices chanting,

01:26:07.610 --> 01:26:08.910
the first couple of steps you take,

01:26:08.910 --> 01:26:10.985
you see this weird mist

01:26:10.985 --> 01:26:12.745
pouring off of the wood

01:26:12.745 --> 01:26:14.980
and with each step, it billows heavier and heavier

01:26:14.980 --> 01:26:19.205
and has a dull, rich green coloration to it.

01:26:19.205 --> 01:26:22.396
and has a dull, rich green coloration to it.

01:26:22.396 --> 01:26:25.050
And as you step to the main central area,

01:26:25.050 --> 01:26:28.760
it forms this greenish mist fog

01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:31.110
that surrounds the edges of the stage.

01:26:32.032 --> 01:26:34.809
TRAVIS: So Eurovision.
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:26:34.809 --> 01:26:36.830
LAURA: I'm going to use Thaumaturgy to make it sound

01:26:36.830 --> 01:26:39.038
like the crowd starts chanting,

01:26:39.038 --> 01:26:41.138
"Yasha, Yasha, Yasha."
TRAVIS: Please welcome, Xhorhas.

01:26:41.138 --> 01:26:45.148
(laughter)

01:26:45.148 --> 01:26:47.320
ASHLEY: Xhorhas is the perfect Eurovision name.

01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:48.520
(laughter)

01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:51.805
(vague European accent) We are Xhorhas.

01:26:51.805 --> 01:26:53.530
Okay, so I'm going to go up there

01:26:53.530 --> 01:26:56.786
and because everybody's chanting,

01:26:57.862 --> 01:27:00.454
I'm going to turn my back to the audience.

01:27:00.454 --> 01:27:01.680
MATT: Okay.

01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:04.870
ASHLEY: And start playing my harp.

01:27:04.870 --> 01:27:09.770
And I'm going to start out doing

01:27:09.770 --> 01:27:11.661
a version of--

01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:18.080
kind of like "Immigrant Song" by Led Zeppelin,

01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:19.347
and then turn it into like

01:27:19.347 --> 01:27:22.500
"Run to the Hills" by Iron Maiden towards the end.

01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:23.366
MATT: Okay, okay.

01:27:23.366 --> 01:27:28.363
ASHLEY: You know, some kind of metal-y, jaunty, moony,

01:27:28.363 --> 01:27:30.160
dark kind of vibe.

01:27:30.160 --> 01:27:31.040
MATT: Okay.

01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:33.240
Now, you don't notice this as you're focusing on the music

01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:34.670
and as you're hitting the the low beat

01:27:34.670 --> 01:27:35.580
and getting it to rise,

01:27:35.580 --> 01:27:39.377
you all watch as that mist begins to grow above

01:27:39.377 --> 01:27:41.910
and much like those giant,

01:27:41.910 --> 01:27:44.540
you know, demonic, skeletal backdrops

01:27:44.540 --> 01:27:46.920
in concerts during metal shows in the eighties

01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:48.310
that looked absolutely ridiculous.

01:27:48.310 --> 01:27:52.644
This large green cloak rises up over Yasha

01:27:52.644 --> 01:27:56.201
and you can see the face of the Traveler,

01:27:56.201 --> 01:27:58.510
massive, begins to peer through the hood.

01:27:58.510 --> 01:27:59.710
Almost falling into place.

01:27:59.710 --> 01:28:01.690
Like it was sliding into the cloak

01:28:01.690 --> 01:28:04.510
and the voice begins to echo out from underneath

01:28:04.510 --> 01:28:06.589
and goes,

01:28:06.589 --> 01:28:10.393
"Welcome, my friends, my chosen.

01:28:11.494 --> 01:28:13.095
"For today

01:28:14.469 --> 01:28:19.419
"is the day that we celebrate me.

01:28:22.085 --> 01:28:24.047
"And to begin,

01:28:24.047 --> 01:28:29.047
"let us all revel in the musical stylings

01:28:29.213 --> 01:28:31.987
(laughter)

01:28:31.987 --> 01:28:34.632
"of Yasha the Reborn!"

01:28:34.632 --> 01:28:35.465
LAURA: Ooh!

01:28:35.465 --> 01:28:37.648
ASHLEY: (sings Immigrant Song theme)
(laughter)

01:28:37.648 --> 01:28:39.948
TRAVIS: The VMAs are fucking sick this year!

01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:42.982
LIAM: Caleb will use Major Image at this moment,

01:28:42.982 --> 01:28:45.340
which can go for a total of 10 minutes. To start with,

01:28:45.340 --> 01:28:46.990
like, those glass balls of electricity,

01:28:46.990 --> 01:28:48.356
where you touch them and

01:28:48.356 --> 01:28:50.020
lines come out of electricity.
MARISHA: Plasma balls.

01:28:50.020 --> 01:28:53.550
LIAM: Electric lines leave Yasha's body

01:28:53.550 --> 01:28:55.540
and go down to the stage and the people in the front row.

01:28:55.540 --> 01:28:56.590
And some of them intersect

01:28:56.590 --> 01:28:59.784
and make jagged lightning penises.

01:28:59.784 --> 01:29:01.910
And some of them make jagged lightning moons,

01:29:01.910 --> 01:29:03.300
but the moons are a little more subtle,

01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:06.830
but there's just shapes appearing in these electric snakes

01:29:06.830 --> 01:29:09.520
coming of her body down to the ground.

01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:10.353
MATT: Fantastic.

01:29:10.353 --> 01:29:12.570
TALIESIN: I use Thaumaturgy to make some amps in the back

01:29:12.570 --> 01:29:13.750
for the people who are too away

01:29:13.750 --> 01:29:14.930
from the stage to really hear it.

01:29:14.930 --> 01:29:17.734
So we're getting the full concert experience.

01:29:17.734 --> 01:29:19.970
(laughter)

01:29:19.970 --> 01:29:20.803
ASHLEY: Awesome.

01:29:20.803 --> 01:29:22.010
MATT: Go ahead and roll a performance check for me.

01:29:22.010 --> 01:29:23.380
LAURA: Oh god!

01:29:23.380 --> 01:29:25.660
MARISHA: Come on!
LAURA: With advantage, right?

01:29:25.660 --> 01:29:26.493
ASHLEY: Say again?
MATT: I don't know, did you cast

01:29:26.493 --> 01:29:28.159
the spell on her before she went up there?

01:29:28.159 --> 01:29:28.993
LAURA: No!

01:29:28.993 --> 01:29:31.384
(laughter)

01:29:31.384 --> 01:29:32.700
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:34.560
Come on.

01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:37.286
MATT: I will say, I will say before we do the roll.

01:29:37.286 --> 01:29:40.036
ASHLEY: Ooh.
(laughter)

01:29:40.036 --> 01:29:42.378
MATT: I'll say with everyone else enhancing the experience,

01:29:42.378 --> 01:29:44.410
I'll give it advantage because it is in a communal--

01:29:44.410 --> 01:29:45.276
everyone is helping.

01:29:45.276 --> 01:29:47.518
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:29:47.518 --> 01:29:48.563
Let's hope this is better.

01:29:48.563 --> 01:29:50.020
TRAVIS: Make a difference.

01:29:50.020 --> 01:29:50.853
ASHLEY: Mm-mm.

01:29:50.853 --> 01:29:53.078
(laughter)

01:29:54.359 --> 01:29:56.134
ASHLEY: Okay, so

01:29:56.134 --> 01:29:58.241
that would be five total.

01:29:58.241 --> 01:30:00.324
(groans)

01:30:01.336 --> 01:30:05.828
(laughter)

01:30:07.625 --> 01:30:09.645
LAURA: Cheese sandwiches!

01:30:09.645 --> 01:30:12.862
MARISHA: You know when you can hear when
someone's really bad at Rock Band?

01:30:13.704 --> 01:30:17.290
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (electronic plunking sounds)

01:30:17.290 --> 01:30:20.360
LIAM: But instead of the (vocalizing), it's just that goat.

01:30:21.490 --> 01:30:23.264
ASHLEY: (goat yelling)

01:30:23.264 --> 01:30:26.106
MATT: But-- (laughs)

01:30:26.106 --> 01:30:28.130
But you're into it.

01:30:28.130 --> 01:30:31.040
You are just rocking that shit and, you know,

01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:34.589
people are still into it, you know, they're--

01:30:34.589 --> 01:30:35.966
it's not terrible, by any means.

01:30:35.966 --> 01:30:38.671
ASHLEY: It's the opening act, okay.

01:30:38.671 --> 01:30:39.700
They're not always good.

01:30:39.700 --> 01:30:41.630
MATT: But as you're getting into it, you can see--

01:30:41.630 --> 01:30:42.696
ASHLEY: The opening, opening act.

01:30:42.696 --> 01:30:45.683
MATT: Yeah, as you're getting into it,
people are still clapping along.

01:30:45.683 --> 01:30:46.650
There's still excitement in the crowd.

01:30:46.650 --> 01:30:48.980
People are gathering because it is still a display.

01:30:48.980 --> 01:30:51.440
And I've been to many shows where they were okay,

01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:53.700
but the presentation was fucking on point.

01:30:53.700 --> 01:30:54.920
It's that people are there.

01:30:54.920 --> 01:30:56.395
People are there.

01:30:56.395 --> 01:30:58.020
You do see in the front row,

01:30:58.020 --> 01:30:59.990
Kent Plucker, sitting there with his lute over his shoulder,

01:30:59.990 --> 01:31:01.332
looking at her like--

01:31:03.430 --> 01:31:04.590
He knows.

01:31:04.590 --> 01:31:07.015
And he's reveling in it.

01:31:07.015 --> 01:31:08.476
But you don't give a shit.

01:31:09.510 --> 01:31:10.540
But nevertheless,

01:31:10.540 --> 01:31:12.380
the music swells,

01:31:12.380 --> 01:31:15.310
performance is still breathtaking

01:31:15.310 --> 01:31:17.823
around the central part of it.

01:31:18.717 --> 01:31:19.720
And it comes to a close.

01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:21.127
Everyone cheers.

01:31:21.127 --> 01:31:22.160
(cheering)

01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:23.251
MARISHA: Yeah!

01:31:24.345 --> 01:31:25.320
Encore!

01:31:26.211 --> 01:31:27.800
LAURA: Yasha the Reborn!

01:31:27.800 --> 01:31:30.346
ASHLEY: So I start playing again because Beau requested.

01:31:30.346 --> 01:31:31.410
MARISHA: Yeah!

01:31:32.650 --> 01:31:34.070
MATT: Do you encore?

01:31:34.070 --> 01:31:34.903
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:31:34.903 --> 01:31:36.750
MATT: Roll a performance check.

01:31:36.750 --> 01:31:39.016
ASHLEY: Come on, let's do one good song.

01:31:40.666 --> 01:31:42.447
Oh, 13.

01:31:42.447 --> 01:31:43.280
MATT: 13?

01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:44.420
That's good. That's a success.

01:31:44.420 --> 01:31:46.010
TRAVIS: Markedly better.

01:31:46.010 --> 01:31:47.813
MATT: Markedly better.
ASHLEY: I had to get my wiggles out.

01:31:47.813 --> 01:31:48.957
MATT: As you finish it, people are like,

01:31:48.957 --> 01:31:49.970
"Oh good, she's done,"

01:31:49.970 --> 01:31:51.540
and some people start wandering off a little bit.

01:31:51.540 --> 01:31:52.560
The crowd begins to disperse.

01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:54.867
And as soon as we get the second song, you're like,

01:31:54.867 --> 01:31:56.060
"Oh, here we go."

01:31:56.060 --> 01:31:57.180
And you find the stride.

01:31:57.180 --> 01:31:59.060
And as you hit, the crowd stops

01:31:59.060 --> 01:32:00.426
and those folks start wandering back.

01:32:00.426 --> 01:32:02.990
And they're like, "Oh, she was punking us."

01:32:02.990 --> 01:32:04.680
TRAVIS: The people left the Marvel movie too quick.

01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:06.116
MATT: Yeah, yeah.

01:32:07.194 --> 01:32:09.545
TALIESIN: You just got to go back to the previous album.

01:32:09.545 --> 01:32:11.607
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

01:32:11.607 --> 01:32:12.760
LIAM: Those electric lines become

01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:17.527
big web spider-webbed wings coming up out of the back.

01:32:17.527 --> 01:32:20.070
MATT: It is quite the performance.

01:32:20.070 --> 01:32:21.680
Whether it be the stage nerves

01:32:21.680 --> 01:32:23.690
or the severe amount of alcohol

01:32:23.690 --> 01:32:24.820
you consumed the night before,

01:32:24.820 --> 01:32:25.653
off to a rocky start,

01:32:25.653 --> 01:32:26.486
but you picked it up--

01:32:26.486 --> 01:32:29.030
ASHLEY: A little bit of both.
MATT: And now it's on-- probably a little bit of both.

01:32:29.030 --> 01:32:33.090
Nevertheless, Traveler Con is off without a hitch.

01:32:33.090 --> 01:32:36.040
Excitement hits as she finishes her performance

01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:38.133
and everyone cheers.

01:32:38.133 --> 01:32:40.980
And you can see other individuals start gathering their

01:32:40.980 --> 01:32:44.040
drumsticks or big drum hits.

01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:45.930
But they have these little heads at the end.

01:32:45.930 --> 01:32:47.550
And in her finale,

01:32:47.550 --> 01:32:50.765
they bring together the drums and (drum beating)

01:32:50.765 --> 01:32:51.740
to match the beat.

01:32:51.740 --> 01:32:54.550
And you can now hear about seven or eight different sets

01:32:54.550 --> 01:32:57.950
of drums that are now matching Yasha's performance

01:32:57.950 --> 01:33:02.730
as they just hit these heavy leather-stretched drums

01:33:02.730 --> 01:33:05.011
with these wooden dicks.

01:33:07.190 --> 01:33:08.580
LAURA: Is that dinosaur hide drums?

01:33:08.580 --> 01:33:10.620
Those are the dinosaur hide drums.

01:33:10.620 --> 01:33:11.846
ASHLEY: That's right.

01:33:12.780 --> 01:33:14.260
MATT: This probably would have been existing hide

01:33:14.260 --> 01:33:15.235
of the dinosaurs, yes.

01:33:15.235 --> 01:33:16.536
It wouldn't be from the T-Rex you guys-- because it would

01:33:16.536 --> 01:33:18.669
take a lot longer to stretch that hide,

01:33:18.669 --> 01:33:20.890
but from existing hides taken from dinosaurs.

01:33:20.890 --> 01:33:22.115
LAURA: Still cool!

01:33:23.710 --> 01:33:26.190
MATT: But as the performance comes to a close,

01:33:26.190 --> 01:33:28.450
the crowd's now like, "What's next?"

01:33:28.450 --> 01:33:31.763
SAM: I'll go up on stage as was our plan.

01:33:31.763 --> 01:33:34.127
(laughter)

01:33:34.127 --> 01:33:34.960
SAM: And just be like:

01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:38.381
Oh, everyone give it up one more time for Yasha!

01:33:38.381 --> 01:33:40.631
(cheering)

01:33:42.070 --> 01:33:44.030
She'll be back later for more.

01:33:44.030 --> 01:33:44.863
MARISHA: Yeah!

01:33:44.863 --> 01:33:46.540
SAM: But in the meantime,

01:33:46.540 --> 01:33:50.874
we'd like to bring you our keynote speaker for the evening.

01:33:50.874 --> 01:33:51.840
You all know her.

01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:52.760
You all love her.

01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:55.310
The Traveler certainly does.

01:33:55.310 --> 01:33:58.036
She's the princess of pranks.

01:33:58.036 --> 01:34:00.502
She's the tycoon of tricks.

01:34:00.502 --> 01:34:03.137
She's the conquistador of cocks.

01:34:03.137 --> 01:34:05.306
Please welcome--

01:34:05.306 --> 01:34:06.450
MARISHA: Wait.

01:34:08.157 --> 01:34:09.657
ASHLEY: What a title.

01:34:09.657 --> 01:34:11.570
(laughter)

01:34:11.570 --> 01:34:14.401
SAM: And then I'll take out my pistol,

01:34:14.401 --> 01:34:16.400
just for added effect.

01:34:16.400 --> 01:34:19.777
I'll just say: High Priestess Jester!

01:34:19.777 --> 01:34:22.648
And I'll just fire it straight down into the stage.

01:34:22.648 --> 01:34:25.500
(laughter)

01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:27.060
TRAVIS: Not up, down?

01:34:27.060 --> 01:34:27.893
SAM: Yeah.

01:34:27.893 --> 01:34:29.420
MATT: So just to confirm,

01:34:29.420 --> 01:34:31.440
because when you got that, it had one bullet in there.

01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:34.038
SAM: You told me I had 20.

01:34:35.321 --> 01:34:37.040
MATT: But I was saying, have you got bullets since then?

01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:39.420
SAM: Oh yeah, I got-- I bought 20 at some point.

01:34:39.420 --> 01:34:41.536
MATT: Yes, you did. I just wanted
make sure you had purchased that.

01:34:41.536 --> 01:34:43.156
TRAVIS: You fired your one bullet.

01:34:43.156 --> 01:34:45.450
SAM: Because I wrote down that I have 19 left.

01:34:45.450 --> 01:34:46.885
MATT: Then yes, then you'd have it.

01:34:46.885 --> 01:34:48.434
I just want to confirm it that that happened before.

01:34:48.434 --> 01:34:50.795
ASHLEY: You fired your bullet from a foot away from the--

01:34:50.795 --> 01:34:53.610
MATT: Yeah. So (impacts)

01:34:53.610 --> 01:34:55.510
It's a dull thud and wood splinters up

01:34:55.510 --> 01:34:57.210
in the immediate vicinity.

01:34:58.260 --> 01:35:00.507
Everyone's like, "Yeah!"

01:35:00.507 --> 01:35:01.632
SAM: Jester!

01:35:02.970 --> 01:35:05.780
LAURA: Okay, right before I go on stage.

01:35:05.780 --> 01:35:08.014
I'm going to be behind the stage so nobody can see me.

01:35:08.014 --> 01:35:08.847
MATT: Okay.

01:35:08.847 --> 01:35:10.698
LAURA: I'm going to cast Mirror Image on myself.

01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:13.998
So there's four of me.

01:35:13.998 --> 01:35:15.430
MATT: All right.

01:35:15.430 --> 01:35:18.540
LAURA: And then I'm going to cast Dimension Door

01:35:18.540 --> 01:35:20.310
to bamf onto the stage.

01:35:20.310 --> 01:35:21.143
MARISHA: Cool.

01:35:21.143 --> 01:35:22.780
LAURA: So it should look like all four of me

01:35:22.780 --> 01:35:23.853
are bamfing onto the stage.

01:35:23.853 --> 01:35:26.360
MATT: Indeed, so as you finish saying the phrase,

01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:29.940
there's just a slight bit of

01:35:29.940 --> 01:35:31.057
a pause where everyone goes like,

01:35:31.057 --> 01:35:33.246
"Yay! Is she--?"

01:35:33.246 --> 01:35:34.420
(explosion)

01:35:34.420 --> 01:35:36.690
Emerges from this giant plume

01:35:36.690 --> 01:35:41.120
of greenish-blue smoke that swirls up into the air.

01:35:41.120 --> 01:35:44.930
And as it disperses, there are now four Jesters,

01:35:44.930 --> 01:35:46.760
three of which are somewhat shimmery

01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:49.660
and flickering in and out.

01:35:49.660 --> 01:35:51.340
She arrives wearing the outfit

01:35:51.340 --> 01:35:54.524
you had painted the evening before? Or--?

01:35:54.524 --> 01:35:56.332
LAURA: Not yet.
MATT: Not yet, okay.

01:35:56.332 --> 01:35:59.310
LAURA: Still in my normal Traveler garb.

01:35:59.310 --> 01:36:00.143
MATT: Okay.

01:36:00.143 --> 01:36:01.772
LAURA: But I am in a cloak.
MATT: Yes.

01:36:01.772 --> 01:36:03.347
LIAM: I'll hit her with Major Image

01:36:03.347 --> 01:36:06.070
and the cloak looks vibrant green,

01:36:06.070 --> 01:36:11.070
unnaturally vibrant green with all kinds of silver thread

01:36:11.407 --> 01:36:12.570
scattered all across it.

01:36:12.570 --> 01:36:16.670
And enormous, three-times-as-big-as-Jester butterfly wings

01:36:16.670 --> 01:36:19.020
extend up and out from behind her,

01:36:19.020 --> 01:36:21.820
and then more vague ones on the clones.

01:36:21.820 --> 01:36:24.100
And if you look closely at the pattern, it's beautiful,

01:36:24.100 --> 01:36:25.690
pink and green and blue,

01:36:25.690 --> 01:36:27.740
and of course there are signature penises

01:36:27.740 --> 01:36:31.290
hidden in the design of the wings and moons now as well,

01:36:31.290 --> 01:36:34.596
because it's all about that subliminal messaging.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:36:34.596 --> 01:36:38.308
LIAM: And they just flap gently behind her as she appears.

01:36:38.308 --> 01:36:41.742
MATT: The crowd just (gasps) "Whoa!"

01:36:42.885 --> 01:36:44.110
LAURA: Thank you.

01:36:44.110 --> 01:36:45.350
I'm going to spread my arms out

01:36:45.350 --> 01:36:50.013
so all of my other Jesters also spread their arms out.

01:36:50.013 --> 01:36:54.099
And I'm going to say: Let chaos reign!

01:36:55.151 --> 01:36:58.430
MATT: "Let chaos reign!"
(cheering)

01:36:58.430 --> 01:37:00.765
LAURA: I'm going to cast Spiritual Guardians

01:37:00.765 --> 01:37:02.000
because this is all I have.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.100
I'm gonna cast Spiritual Guardians to bamf

01:37:04.100 --> 01:37:05.640
out of my hands right as I saw that

01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:09.220
as a bunch of pink,

01:37:09.220 --> 01:37:11.390
beautiful baby unicorns fly around,

01:37:11.390 --> 01:37:13.242
but they've got giant penises.

01:37:13.242 --> 01:37:15.070
(laughter)

01:37:15.070 --> 01:37:15.978
TRAVIS: Wait, giant horns

01:37:15.978 --> 01:37:19.304
or giant penises?
MATT: There is so much going on right now.

01:37:19.304 --> 01:37:21.480
But while you're doing this Jester, Caleb,

01:37:21.480 --> 01:37:23.200
there's somebody in the audience next to you

01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:25.330
after you do the hand motions to create the spell,

01:37:25.330 --> 01:37:26.800
everyone's in awe. This individual

01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:30.050
looks like just a regular, schlubby-looking fellow

01:37:30.050 --> 01:37:32.836
with a scraggly beard looks over at you and goes,

01:37:32.836 --> 01:37:34.570
"Hmph."

01:37:34.570 --> 01:37:36.622
And then as Jester begins casting the spell,

01:37:36.622 --> 01:37:38.230
flicks his finger a bit like this,

01:37:38.230 --> 01:37:41.410
and you watch it as, from the wood platform below the stage,

01:37:41.410 --> 01:37:46.350
vines begin to rise up and create this throne made of thorns

01:37:46.350 --> 01:37:49.230
and brambles that cascades

01:37:49.230 --> 01:37:52.740
and curls around it to form this elevated throne

01:37:52.740 --> 01:37:54.660
that catches you from underneath

01:37:54.660 --> 01:37:56.410
as you have your hands out.

01:37:56.410 --> 01:37:57.993
LAURA: Nice, Caleb!

01:38:00.486 --> 01:38:02.860
MATT: The strange man next to you looks over at you

01:38:02.860 --> 01:38:06.070
with a flash of green in his eyes and goes, "Hmm."

01:38:06.908 --> 01:38:08.298
LIAM: What's up, Red?

01:38:09.580 --> 01:38:10.590
MATT: Continue, Jester.

01:38:10.590 --> 01:38:13.053
LAURA: I'm going to stand up on the throne.

01:38:13.930 --> 01:38:15.017
And I'm going to say:

01:38:15.017 --> 01:38:18.041
Welcome, one and all,

01:38:18.041 --> 01:38:21.723
to Traveler Con 3000!

01:38:21.723 --> 01:38:24.575
(cheering)

01:38:24.575 --> 01:38:25.800
Thank you.

01:38:26.636 --> 01:38:31.331
As you know, the Traveler likes everyone here.

01:38:31.331 --> 01:38:33.470
Me mostly,

01:38:33.470 --> 01:38:34.438
but--

01:38:34.438 --> 01:38:35.730
MATT: (small explosions) You hear

01:38:35.730 --> 01:38:36.920
some fireworks go off

01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:39.046
and everyone looks over,

01:38:39.046 --> 01:38:41.110
and you see Treece over,

01:38:41.110 --> 01:38:42.470
just runs into the nearby bushes,

01:38:42.470 --> 01:38:43.436
trying not to get caught.

01:38:43.436 --> 01:38:45.070
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:49.190
LAURA: So you all traveled really far to get here,

01:38:49.190 --> 01:38:52.695
and we've got so many fun things in store for you.

01:38:53.537 --> 01:38:56.990
Check out the fighting pit! Or get drunk,

01:38:56.990 --> 01:39:00.270
I don't know, maybe play some more drums.

01:39:00.270 --> 01:39:02.830
But the main thing we're going to do today

01:39:02.830 --> 01:39:05.383
is go on a dick hunt.

01:39:05.383 --> 01:39:09.310
(cheering)

01:39:09.310 --> 01:39:11.670
LIAM: The patterns on her wings melt like a

01:39:11.670 --> 01:39:14.335
lava lamp and spell out "dick hunt"

01:39:14.335 --> 01:39:16.590
across the open wings.

01:39:16.590 --> 01:39:19.309
LAURA: The Traveler's been hard to work for all of you

01:39:19.309 --> 01:39:23.355
hiding many, many dicks around the village and the island.

01:39:23.355 --> 01:39:25.501
Once everybody finds one,

01:39:25.501 --> 01:39:28.130
we're going to make a special trek

01:39:28.130 --> 01:39:32.379
just so we can help the Traveler

01:39:32.379 --> 01:39:33.520
fully ascend

01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:36.535
and you're going to see some crazy shit, you guys.

01:39:36.535 --> 01:39:38.729
(laughter)

01:39:38.729 --> 01:39:40.979
(cheering)

01:39:41.950 --> 01:39:43.680
MATT: "Is there a contest?"

01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:45.320
LAURA: Yes!

01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:46.380
Yes, there is.

01:39:46.380 --> 01:39:49.005
Whoever finds the--

01:39:49.005 --> 01:39:50.228
(whispering) Did we end up--?

01:39:50.228 --> 01:39:54.647
Whoever finds the golden dick gets a special prize.

01:39:54.647 --> 01:39:55.771
MATT: "Ooh, ah!"

01:39:55.771 --> 01:39:57.329
"I'm gonna find that dick!"

01:39:57.329 --> 01:39:58.412
LAURA: Yeah.

01:39:58.412 --> 01:40:01.070
So once you guys find your dicks.

01:40:01.070 --> 01:40:02.382
SAM: What's the prize?

01:40:02.382 --> 01:40:03.590
LAURA: It's a secret.

01:40:03.590 --> 01:40:06.334
Once you guys find them, come up to the stage.

01:40:06.334 --> 01:40:07.649
And once everybody's here,

01:40:07.649 --> 01:40:11.147
we'll start the rest of the shit.

01:40:11.147 --> 01:40:12.822
Have fun!

01:40:12.822 --> 01:40:14.714
Let chaos reign!

01:40:14.714 --> 01:40:16.800
(cheering)

01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:19.445
MATT: Everyone cheers and then stays for a minute.

01:40:19.445 --> 01:40:20.697
LAURA: Go!

01:40:20.697 --> 01:40:21.971
MATT: The crowd scatters,

01:40:21.971 --> 01:40:24.380
immediately starts running in all directions.

01:40:24.380 --> 01:40:25.880
Some folks are knocked over,

01:40:25.880 --> 01:40:27.290
tables get tossed.

01:40:27.290 --> 01:40:31.090
It is just chaos reigning as folks begin to rush off

01:40:31.090 --> 01:40:34.902
into the epic dick hunt of the afternoon.

01:40:34.902 --> 01:40:35.920
LAURA: (sighs)

01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:37.010
That went so good.

01:40:37.010 --> 01:40:39.640
I mean, you guys. I come down.

01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:40.665
Was my speech good?

01:40:40.665 --> 01:40:43.562
TALIESIN: It was very good.
TRAVIS: Fantastic.

01:40:43.562 --> 01:40:44.533
Moving.

01:40:44.533 --> 01:40:45.965
LAURA: Everybody looked like they were so excited

01:40:45.965 --> 01:40:47.015
about the dick hunt.

01:40:47.015 --> 01:40:48.165
TRAVIS: Well done, Caleb.

01:40:48.165 --> 01:40:50.648
That was absolutely extraordinary.
LAURA: Caleb, that was so cool! The <i>wings</i>!

01:40:50.648 --> 01:40:52.483
SAM: I didn't know you could do that.

01:40:52.483 --> 01:40:54.970
LIAM: It's all about that D.

01:40:54.970 --> 01:40:57.197
MARISHA: Yeah, is it?

01:40:57.197 --> 01:41:00.547
SAM: Yasha, your performance was really just great,

01:41:00.547 --> 01:41:02.489
SAM: Yasha, your performance was really just great,

01:41:02.489 --> 01:41:03.406
ASHLEY: Well, you know,

01:41:03.406 --> 01:41:04.522
it took me a little bit to warm up

01:41:04.522 --> 01:41:07.390
because I was a little, you know, had stage fright.

01:41:07.390 --> 01:41:08.520
LAURA: Amazing.

01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:09.620
ASHLEY: Thank you.

01:41:09.620 --> 01:41:12.278
I think I finally got into the groove

01:41:12.278 --> 01:41:14.335
as it went on, but,

01:41:14.335 --> 01:41:15.217
yeah, it was fun.

01:41:15.217 --> 01:41:16.050
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:41:16.050 --> 01:41:16.883
So what,

01:41:16.883 --> 01:41:18.340
someone's going to look for the golden dick.

01:41:18.340 --> 01:41:19.760
We did make a golden dick?

01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:20.822
ASHLEY: Yeah, we did, we did, we did.

01:41:20.822 --> 01:41:22.111
SAM: We did.
ASHLEY: We did make a golden dick.

01:41:22.111 --> 01:41:24.536
SAM: We don't have a-- do we have a prize?

01:41:24.536 --> 01:41:25.602
LAURA: No, no, we made one.

01:41:25.602 --> 01:41:27.830
We painted it with our gold dust paint.

01:41:27.830 --> 01:41:29.303
LIAM: I think we just talked about it, I don't think--

01:41:29.303 --> 01:41:32.826
I can make a golden dick, but I have not done it yet.

01:41:32.826 --> 01:41:33.659
I can do it lickety-split.

01:41:33.659 --> 01:41:34.884
TRAVIS: (singsong) I've got a golden dick.

01:41:34.884 --> 01:41:36.880
SAM: I thought I gave a bunch of gold dust.

01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:37.713
LAURA: You did.

01:41:37.713 --> 01:41:40.840
I made golden paint and I painted one of the dicks gold.

01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:42.503
SAM: Okay, good.
LAURA: So there is that.

01:41:42.503 --> 01:41:43.870
LIAM: I just need some coin, I have it.

01:41:43.870 --> 01:41:45.070
I will use my own coin.

01:41:45.070 --> 01:41:45.970
I will make you a golden dick.

01:41:45.970 --> 01:41:47.740
How big would you like the dick to be?

01:41:47.740 --> 01:41:49.220
MARISHA: Well, I mean, it should be relative

01:41:49.220 --> 01:41:50.390
to the other dick sizes.

01:41:50.390 --> 01:41:51.550
LAURA: Well no, the golden dick should

01:41:51.550 --> 01:41:53.580
probably be a little bit larger?

01:41:53.580 --> 01:41:55.110
MARISHA: Shit, no, I don't know.

01:41:55.110 --> 01:41:56.250
LAURA: Or maybe it would be smaller

01:41:56.250 --> 01:41:58.130
like it's harder to find.

01:41:58.130 --> 01:41:59.400
But we already have a golden dick.

01:41:59.400 --> 01:42:01.430
This is just for our own personal use.

01:42:01.430 --> 01:42:03.090
Maybe it's like-- ooh, this is tricky.

01:42:03.090 --> 01:42:04.120
This one's the real one

01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:05.385
and one of us can find the real one

01:42:05.385 --> 01:42:06.440
so we actually don't have to do

01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:08.172
a special prize for somebody.

01:42:08.172 --> 01:42:10.706
SAM: You're going to cheat them out of a prize?

01:42:10.706 --> 01:42:12.807
LAURA: We don't have a real prize anyway, there's nothing.

01:42:12.807 --> 01:42:15.030
SAM: We can give them five gold or something.

01:42:15.030 --> 01:42:17.502
ASHLEY: You could give them the real gold dick.

01:42:17.502 --> 01:42:18.640
LAURA: That's a good idea.

01:42:18.640 --> 01:42:20.196
ASHLEY: And then they have two.

01:42:20.196 --> 01:42:21.696
(laughter)

01:42:21.696 --> 01:42:23.491
LIAM: Let chaos reign!

01:42:23.491 --> 01:42:24.599
ASHLEY: Ah!

01:42:26.510 --> 01:42:28.440
No, there's got to be a better prize than that.

01:42:28.440 --> 01:42:31.037
You know, if you find a golden dick--

01:42:31.037 --> 01:42:32.770
LAURA: -- then you get, like--

01:42:32.770 --> 01:42:35.170
MARISHA: What if we pulled from our hoard?

01:42:35.170 --> 01:42:36.510
There's got to be something.

01:42:36.510 --> 01:42:37.420
TRAVIS: We should do it quickly.

01:42:37.420 --> 01:42:39.340
I mean, do you see many people have bloody noses

01:42:39.340 --> 01:42:41.110
as you sent them off in a mad dash

01:42:41.110 --> 01:42:42.548
for a dick that doesn't exist yer?

01:42:42.548 --> 01:42:45.340
LAURA: Some of those dicks are
super, super, super hard to find.

01:42:45.340 --> 01:42:46.780
So, you know,

01:42:46.780 --> 01:42:48.789
it's going to take a long time for people to find them.

01:42:48.789 --> 01:42:49.669
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:42:49.669 --> 01:42:52.430
MARISHA: Are people going to get really mad at this?

01:42:52.430 --> 01:42:54.220
At this game?

01:42:54.220 --> 01:42:55.586
LAURA: No!

01:42:55.586 --> 01:42:58.050
SAM: This is the smallest part of the day.

01:42:58.050 --> 01:43:00.320
LAURA: They got a lot ahead of them.

01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:01.530
MATT: As the hours pass,

01:43:03.282 --> 01:43:06.470
some people begin returning with various dicks they found

01:43:06.470 --> 01:43:08.980
across the island of Rumblecusp, various sizes,

01:43:08.980 --> 01:43:10.460
shapes, unique styles,

01:43:10.460 --> 01:43:12.773
some well carved, some not so well carved,

01:43:14.790 --> 01:43:16.030
but you also notice that there

01:43:16.030 --> 01:43:18.310
are some enterprising individuals,

01:43:18.310 --> 01:43:20.186
especially those who are a little more well off

01:43:20.186 --> 01:43:21.480
than other followers of the Traveler

01:43:21.480 --> 01:43:23.410
are now going around and asking to purchase

01:43:23.410 --> 01:43:25.050
the better dicks off of the other folk.

01:43:25.050 --> 01:43:28.218
And there's now a small economy,

01:43:28.218 --> 01:43:29.220
competitive economy growing

01:43:29.220 --> 01:43:30.190
within the middle of the dick hunt.

01:43:30.190 --> 01:43:31.638
LAURA: It's like your birthday party, Matt.

01:43:31.638 --> 01:43:32.647
MARISHA: I like it, yeah.

01:43:32.647 --> 01:43:35.063
LIAM: The new DickCoin economy.

01:43:35.063 --> 01:43:36.464
(laughter)

01:43:36.464 --> 01:43:38.240
TRAVIS: Radish trade. Turnip?

01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:39.374
TALIESIN: Growth industry.

01:43:39.374 --> 01:43:43.107
(laughter)

01:43:45.440 --> 01:43:47.350
MATT: A number of hours go by and people begin to return

01:43:47.350 --> 01:43:48.620
and they start getting food

01:43:48.620 --> 01:43:50.760
and comparing their dicks,

01:43:52.003 --> 01:43:56.392
and telling stories about the things they found,

01:43:56.392 --> 01:43:57.783
the things they ran from.

01:43:57.783 --> 01:43:59.175
And some people coming back going like,

01:43:59.175 --> 01:44:02.940
"That's a dangerous-- that's a really dangerous place!

01:44:02.940 --> 01:44:06.321
"Like, there's-- I saw a fucking dinosaur out there!"

01:44:06.321 --> 01:44:08.571
(laughter)

01:44:11.620 --> 01:44:14.437
MATT: So that goes on for a while.

01:44:14.437 --> 01:44:18.562
Eventually, eventually, you see one individual return,

01:44:19.803 --> 01:44:22.100
a familiar human,

01:44:22.100 --> 01:44:25.850
with shoulder-length blonde hair, who you've met once.

01:44:25.850 --> 01:44:29.570
Celia Ovesso, clutching within her hand

01:44:29.570 --> 01:44:32.700
a singular golden dick.

01:44:32.700 --> 01:44:36.240
Flanked by Trudo, her goliath companion.

01:44:36.240 --> 01:44:38.610
Everyone goes like, (gasps) "Oh, shit."

01:44:38.610 --> 01:44:42.847
People get frustrated and as she walks up.

01:44:42.847 --> 01:44:47.142
"Hello, it would seem that I was the one who found

01:44:47.142 --> 01:44:48.824
"the golden dick."

01:44:48.824 --> 01:44:52.270
LAURA: Wow, congratulations, Celia.

01:44:52.270 --> 01:44:53.920
TRAVIS: Ask her where she found it.

01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:56.210
LAURA: I always knew you had it in you.

01:44:56.210 --> 01:44:57.448
MATT: "Hmm, most do."

01:44:58.921 --> 01:45:00.487
LAURA: (giggles)

01:45:00.487 --> 01:45:02.620
So as your special prize,

01:45:02.620 --> 01:45:06.953
you get to be the last person to throw the dick.

01:45:08.390 --> 01:45:10.850
I'm not going to tell you what all we're doing.

01:45:10.850 --> 01:45:13.894
You get to be the final person to do it.

01:45:13.894 --> 01:45:17.320
And therefore set off the ascension.

01:45:17.320 --> 01:45:19.020
That's a pretty amazing thing.

01:45:19.020 --> 01:45:20.043
And maybe,

01:45:21.870 --> 01:45:25.079
maybe the Traveler will be extra grateful to you.

01:45:28.650 --> 01:45:29.763
MATT: "Okay."

01:45:32.450 --> 01:45:33.600
LAURA: I don't know what powers

01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:35.450
the Traveler has given you already.

01:45:35.450 --> 01:45:37.830
Has he given you anything amazing?

01:45:37.830 --> 01:45:39.200
MATT: Oh, quite a few gifts, actually.

01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:41.140
LAURA: Oh, really? Like what?

01:45:41.140 --> 01:45:42.820
MATT: "Well, maybe as the last one

01:45:42.820 --> 01:45:46.763
"to throw my dick into the ascension,

01:45:48.190 --> 01:45:52.058
"I get to show everybody the gifts that I was given, hmm?"

01:45:57.950 --> 01:45:59.190
LAURA: Can I make an insight check?

01:45:59.190 --> 01:46:00.563
MATT: Sure, make an insight check.

01:46:01.430 --> 01:46:04.080
What are you trying to--?

01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:04.913
LAURA: To see--

01:46:04.913 --> 01:46:08.350
I want to see if she's full of shit

01:46:08.350 --> 01:46:10.240
or if her powers-- okay.

01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:11.073
MATT: Sure.

01:46:12.132 --> 01:46:15.220
LAURA: I want to know if her powers are better than mine.

01:46:15.220 --> 01:46:16.245
They can't be.

01:46:18.909 --> 01:46:20.038
18.

01:46:20.038 --> 01:46:21.566
MATT: 18.

01:46:21.566 --> 01:46:23.246
She seems confident.

01:46:24.950 --> 01:46:28.614
You can't really gauge a person's capabilities

01:46:28.614 --> 01:46:29.527
through insight,

01:46:29.527 --> 01:46:32.160
but she seems pretty confident.

01:46:32.160 --> 01:46:33.660
LAURA: Celia,

01:46:33.660 --> 01:46:35.070
it might be dangerous up there

01:46:35.070 --> 01:46:37.730
to show all of your skills, you know?

01:46:37.730 --> 01:46:39.205
MATT: "That is true. Maybe I'll just show

01:46:39.205 --> 01:46:41.000
"the important ones."

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:41.833
LAURA: So?

01:46:44.530 --> 01:46:46.080
What is it?

01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:49.770
Run it by me, because I'm the
High Priestess of the Traveler.

01:46:49.770 --> 01:46:51.060
So I will let you know whether

01:46:51.060 --> 01:46:52.760
or not that's acceptable or not.

01:46:52.760 --> 01:46:56.600
MATT: "Oh, I can have this conversation with him myself."

01:46:56.600 --> 01:46:58.771
LAURA: I don't know if you can,

01:46:58.771 --> 01:46:59.643
unfortunately,

01:47:00.990 --> 01:47:02.640
about these particular things.

01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:05.016
These are really high level.

01:47:06.284 --> 01:47:08.193
SAM: Uncomfortable.

01:47:10.887 --> 01:47:13.313
MATT: "And how did you become the High Priestess again?"

01:47:14.730 --> 01:47:17.780
SAM: Celia, while you guys discuss,

01:47:17.780 --> 01:47:20.020
may I take the dick in question?

01:47:20.020 --> 01:47:22.480
I just want to wash it off for you and consecrate it

01:47:22.480 --> 01:47:24.140
and give it back to you, if that's all right.

01:47:24.140 --> 01:47:24.973
MATT: "Of course."

01:47:25.876 --> 01:47:29.080
SAM: I'll take it and wipe it off and rub it,

01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:31.070
rub it and make it nice and shiny.

01:47:31.070 --> 01:47:33.353
And I'm going to take a drop of

01:47:36.245 --> 01:47:37.928
sovereign glue

01:47:39.910 --> 01:47:42.020
and just sort of paint it on

01:47:42.020 --> 01:47:47.020
just to make it really shiny and nice around the shaft.

01:47:47.940 --> 01:47:50.140
So while they're talking, I'll give it back.

01:47:52.575 --> 01:47:54.290
MATT: Okay.

01:47:54.290 --> 01:47:57.043
(laughter)

01:47:57.043 --> 01:47:58.093
LAURA: Phenomenal.

01:47:58.093 --> 01:47:58.926
MATT: "Thank you.

01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:05.400
"Well, there is still much of a day ahead of us.

01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:07.060
"Maybe if you're lucky,

01:48:07.060 --> 01:48:08.603
"you'll get to see what I'm capable of

01:48:08.603 --> 01:48:10.420
"when the time is right."

01:48:10.420 --> 01:48:11.930
LAURA: Maybe I will.

01:48:11.930 --> 01:48:14.460
Maybe I already know what you're capable of

01:48:14.460 --> 01:48:17.637
because the Traveler's already told me.

01:48:17.637 --> 01:48:20.100
MATT: "I'm sure he's told you all about me.

01:48:21.420 --> 01:48:22.685
"Come, Trudo."

01:48:22.685 --> 01:48:24.313
And she walks off.

01:48:24.313 --> 01:48:25.590
LAURA: Ooh, I hate her.

01:48:25.590 --> 01:48:26.698
Oh my gosh.

01:48:26.698 --> 01:48:28.345
Guys, what if she's one of the ones

01:48:28.345 --> 01:48:30.713
the Traveler said he was still going to talk to?

01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:33.571
TRAVIS: She seems to be quite confident.

01:48:33.571 --> 01:48:34.962
Are we killing her?

01:48:34.962 --> 01:48:36.500
LAURA: Ugh!

01:48:36.500 --> 01:48:38.579
SAM: Jessie, it's going to be okay.

01:48:38.579 --> 01:48:40.100
It's going to be okay.

01:48:40.100 --> 01:48:43.018
There's nothing that she can do that you can't do better.

01:48:43.018 --> 01:48:45.170
ASHLEY: Yeah, and he still put you in charge of everything.

01:48:45.170 --> 01:48:47.340
He didn't put her in charge of anything.

01:48:47.340 --> 01:48:48.990
LAURA: That's true.

01:48:48.990 --> 01:48:51.964
SAM: Trust me. When the time is right,

01:48:51.964 --> 01:48:54.170
ask her to throw her dick in.

01:48:54.170 --> 01:48:55.829
LAURA: Okay.

01:48:57.195 --> 01:48:58.028
Okay.

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:00.894
MARISHA: 9021-Vo.

01:49:00.894 --> 01:49:04.810
(laughter)

01:49:04.810 --> 01:49:06.007
LAURA: What? I didn't hear.

01:49:06.007 --> 01:49:08.390
MARISHA: 9021-Vo.

01:49:08.390 --> 01:49:09.223
LAURA: Jesus.

01:49:10.060 --> 01:49:12.570
MATT: Most of the crowd have returned.

01:49:12.570 --> 01:49:15.800
It looks like the dick hunt has been a resounding success.

01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:17.680
LAURA: What time is it, generally?

01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:19.460
MATT: At this point, it'd be mid-afternoon

01:49:19.460 --> 01:49:23.273
so like 3:30, 4:00 by the time everyone has mostly returned.

01:49:24.540 --> 01:49:26.190
There were some crews that were out there keeping

01:49:26.190 --> 01:49:29.068
perimeter while also doing the dick hunt to make sure that,

01:49:29.068 --> 01:49:30.940
vulnerable members of the community didn't end up being

01:49:30.940 --> 01:49:33.860
swallowed or rent by the creatures

01:49:33.860 --> 01:49:35.780
that exist on the outskirts of the village.

01:49:35.780 --> 01:49:37.533
TRAVIS: Glad we thought of that.

01:49:37.533 --> 01:49:41.210
(laughter)

01:49:41.210 --> 01:49:42.043
MATT: Yeah.

01:49:43.510 --> 01:49:46.740
But there is also still a fight ring.

01:49:46.740 --> 01:49:48.669
I don't know if you guys want to do anything with that.

01:49:48.669 --> 01:49:51.467
(laughter)

01:49:51.467 --> 01:49:53.603
MATT: That is something that you had prepared.
LAURA: I figure people have been

01:49:53.603 --> 01:49:56.397
doing the fighting while--
MARISHA: Yeah, it's background.

01:49:56.397 --> 01:49:57.230
MATT: Okay.

01:49:57.230 --> 01:49:58.340
LAURA: Because you know, people were finding

01:49:58.340 --> 01:49:59.800
their dicks earlier than other people.

01:49:59.800 --> 01:50:01.170
They needed something to entertain them.

01:50:01.170 --> 01:50:02.129
MATT: Right, great.

01:50:02.129 --> 01:50:04.646
SAM: The kids can go in there.

01:50:04.646 --> 01:50:05.860
MATT: The sparring in the fight ring

01:50:05.860 --> 01:50:08.830
is a playful boxing and by the end of the afternoon,

01:50:08.830 --> 01:50:10.720
when people have been drinking, and, for the record,

01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:12.928
this is turning into--

01:50:14.112 --> 01:50:16.978
There are a lot of sloshed individuals by, like, 5:00.

01:50:16.978 --> 01:50:19.100
This is going great.

01:50:19.100 --> 01:50:20.380
And that's all moved to the fight pit,

01:50:20.380 --> 01:50:22.947
which now has people throwing their dicks at each other

01:50:22.947 --> 01:50:24.466
in the middle of the fight ring.

01:50:24.466 --> 01:50:26.270
(laughter)

01:50:26.270 --> 01:50:28.340
And no one's stopping it, nor is anyone arguing.

01:50:28.340 --> 01:50:30.725
It seems like it's perfect.

01:50:30.725 --> 01:50:31.944
TRAVIS: Bedlam.
LIAM: Logical conclusion.

01:50:31.944 --> 01:50:33.177
TRAVIS: Bedlam.
MATT: Indeed.

01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:39.153
However, eventually the sun does begin to set.

01:50:40.390 --> 01:50:44.210
The still-clouded sky becomes oranges,

01:50:44.210 --> 01:50:47.210
purples to dark blue as it coasts over,

01:50:47.210 --> 01:50:51.186
and eventually the night has come.

01:50:52.377 --> 01:50:55.838
The various illusions that were set by you previously

01:50:55.838 --> 01:50:58.290
are alight with their arcane glow.

01:50:58.290 --> 01:51:01.980
The archways and the various illusions of the Traveler

01:51:01.980 --> 01:51:03.877
leading folks to the village--

01:51:03.877 --> 01:51:04.880
LAURA: Blink blink, blink blink.

01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:05.713
MATT: Yep.

01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:08.800
Begin to glow against the various fires.

01:51:08.800 --> 01:51:10.780
The little bonfires that are being set

01:51:10.780 --> 01:51:12.440
throughout the village.

01:51:12.440 --> 01:51:14.553
You have a rather

01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:17.920
not too disorderly,

01:51:17.920 --> 01:51:20.170
but somewhat disorderly crowd of folks that are excited

01:51:20.170 --> 01:51:22.770
for whatever tonight's event is going to be.

01:51:22.770 --> 01:51:25.573
There is a palpable energy and a slight hint of,

01:51:29.160 --> 01:51:31.990
I would say-- the word escapes me for the moment

01:51:31.990 --> 01:51:34.070
because my brain doesn't work right now.

01:51:34.070 --> 01:51:34.993
They are--

01:51:36.690 --> 01:51:37.830
MARISHA: Anxious.
MATT: Anxious,

01:51:37.830 --> 01:51:39.413
we'll go with anxious.

01:51:39.413 --> 01:51:40.637
We'll go with anxious.

01:51:40.637 --> 01:51:44.393
Sometimes the brain fails me.

01:51:45.870 --> 01:51:47.830
But. As everyone's gathered and waiting

01:51:47.830 --> 01:51:50.038
for the high priestess to once again take court

01:51:50.038 --> 01:51:52.356
to lead them into the final event for the day.
LAURA: I've changed into the other outfit.

01:51:52.356 --> 01:51:54.006
MATT: So now you're in the full dress?
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:51:54.006 --> 01:51:54.990
MATT: Fantastic, fantastic.

01:51:54.990 --> 01:51:55.890
Okay.

01:51:55.890 --> 01:51:57.440
LAURA: Yes.

01:51:57.440 --> 01:52:02.278
MARISHA: And question, how many people, roughly, showed up?

01:52:02.278 --> 01:52:03.600
MATT: Who all made the journey?

01:52:03.600 --> 01:52:06.140
There's about 160 people showed up,

01:52:06.140 --> 01:52:07.780
which means you're over 200 individuals

01:52:07.780 --> 01:52:09.690
that are following you.

01:52:09.690 --> 01:52:10.820
Well, no. Actually, they're not all following you.

01:52:10.820 --> 01:52:12.220
There are over 200 in the village.

01:52:12.220 --> 01:52:13.053
So it's very crowded.

01:52:13.053 --> 01:52:15.090
The village was not made for this many people,

01:52:15.090 --> 01:52:17.630
but people that are helping hosts are happy to do so.

01:52:17.630 --> 01:52:19.043
They've made friends.

01:52:19.043 --> 01:52:22.880
They've been very, very gracious and it is a large crowd.

01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:25.043
And you have about

01:52:26.650 --> 01:52:28.000
under 200 people that will be

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.050
making the trek up the mountain with you.

01:52:31.360 --> 01:52:32.193
LAURA: Great.

01:52:33.980 --> 01:52:34.900
MARISHA: Okay.

01:52:34.900 --> 01:52:37.360
SAM: We're leading the march up?

01:52:37.360 --> 01:52:38.580
Who's leading the march up?

01:52:38.580 --> 01:52:40.280
MARISHA: We are.
LAURA: We are.

01:52:40.280 --> 01:52:42.608
SAM: Do you need to make another speech now?

01:52:42.608 --> 01:52:44.370
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, after everyone's gathered

01:52:44.370 --> 01:52:45.203
I'm going to get back on the stage.

01:52:45.203 --> 01:52:47.110
MARISHA: Should we get them food?

01:52:47.110 --> 01:52:48.353
They're real drunk.

01:52:49.290 --> 01:52:50.214
Should they eat?

01:52:50.214 --> 01:52:51.630
LAURA: No, that's part of the fun of it.

01:52:51.630 --> 01:52:53.050
MARISHA: Yeah, all right, yeah.

01:52:53.050 --> 01:52:53.883
LAURA: Right?

01:52:53.883 --> 01:52:55.393
I mean, they've been eating throughout the day.

01:52:55.393 --> 01:52:57.095
It's not like they haven't been allowed to eat, you know?

01:52:57.095 --> 01:52:58.582
MARISHA: Yeah, they knew the itinerary.

01:52:58.582 --> 01:53:00.246
LAURA: Totally.
SAM: They did?

01:53:00.246 --> 01:53:01.614
(laughter)

01:53:01.614 --> 01:53:02.980
LAURA: I'm going to get up on the stage.

01:53:02.980 --> 01:53:05.030
MATT: Okay, as you step up on the stage,

01:53:05.030 --> 01:53:08.160
the throne that was previously there withdraws

01:53:08.160 --> 01:53:09.710
to find you towards the base.

01:53:09.710 --> 01:53:12.820
And as it does, the large tree that stands behind it,

01:53:12.820 --> 01:53:16.720
you watch as the branches bend and curve and spread out,

01:53:16.720 --> 01:53:18.710
roots begin to stretch towards

01:53:18.710 --> 01:53:20.310
the base of each side of the stage

01:53:20.310 --> 01:53:24.054
until it forms a large gateway

01:53:24.054 --> 01:53:26.500
and there, as it ends up touching the ground

01:53:26.500 --> 01:53:27.529
in the center of it,

01:53:27.529 --> 01:53:30.400
there's this weird, shimmery illusion

01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:31.730
that creates space

01:53:31.730 --> 01:53:34.181
that looks like you can step through that gateway.

01:53:34.181 --> 01:53:35.487
You can see it flicker every now and then,

01:53:35.487 --> 01:53:36.660
and you see the tree behind it.

01:53:36.660 --> 01:53:39.200
But there is a horizon in the distance.

01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:41.980
Like this is some sort of a gate or doorway

01:53:41.980 --> 01:53:45.120
that frames you, up 40 plus feet above you

01:53:45.120 --> 01:53:49.500
as you step on and the throne descends to catch you.

01:53:49.500 --> 01:53:50.620
LAURA: Wow.

01:53:50.620 --> 01:53:53.430
Caleb, this is way more than I would've ever expected.

01:53:53.430 --> 01:53:54.620
This is amazing.

01:53:54.620 --> 01:53:56.653
SAM: I'll fire my gun up in the air.

01:53:56.653 --> 01:53:58.785
(laughter)
TRAVIS: 18.

01:53:58.785 --> 01:53:59.713
MATT: (gunshot)

01:53:59.713 --> 01:54:01.900
SAM: Ladies and gentlemen and other,

01:54:01.900 --> 01:54:03.550
please welcome back to the stage,

01:54:03.550 --> 01:54:06.506
the Vanquisher of Veiny Dicks,

01:54:07.492 --> 01:54:09.427
Jester!

01:54:09.427 --> 01:54:13.200
(cheering)

01:54:13.200 --> 01:54:15.623
MATT: You see everyone clapping except for Celia,

01:54:17.440 --> 01:54:19.733
who has her hands tucked right now.

01:54:23.054 --> 01:54:27.820
LAURA: Now that's everyone has gathered their dicks,

01:54:27.820 --> 01:54:32.820
we enter the final stage of the Traveler's ascension.

01:54:33.960 --> 01:54:38.001
Now I ask you, his followers,

01:54:38.001 --> 01:54:40.390
to follow me

01:54:40.390 --> 01:54:44.887
up the mountain, where we will throw our dicks

01:54:44.887 --> 01:54:48.050
into the volcano!

01:54:48.050 --> 01:54:49.750
Dun, dun, dun, dun!

01:54:49.750 --> 01:54:51.833
ALL: Ooh!

01:54:53.008 --> 01:54:54.710
LAURA: It's going to be so fun!

01:54:54.710 --> 01:54:56.010
Okay.

01:54:56.010 --> 01:54:58.130
I don't know how to get down off this thing.

01:54:58.130 --> 01:54:58.963
Can you--?

01:54:58.963 --> 01:55:00.290
MATT: (creaking)

01:55:00.290 --> 01:55:01.123
LAURA: Okay.

01:55:01.123 --> 01:55:03.580
I'm going to lead the way for all of you.

01:55:03.580 --> 01:55:05.740
Follow me and the Traveler,

01:55:05.740 --> 01:55:07.254
he's going to be there too. Okay, come on.

01:55:07.254 --> 01:55:09.840
TRAVIS: Make way for Jester, make way!

01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:11.974
ASHLEY: Make way!
TRAVIS: Make way for Jester!

01:55:11.974 --> 01:55:13.240
LAURA: And the Traveler.
TRAVIS: And the Traveler!

01:55:13.240 --> 01:55:15.183
MARISHA: Move, bitch.
LIAM: And the Traveler!

01:55:15.183 --> 01:55:16.388
TRAVIS: Move, bitch.

01:55:16.388 --> 01:55:17.888
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Get out the way!

01:55:18.770 --> 01:55:19.920
MATT: As Jester begins to walk

01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:22.496
and the crowd parts to let her through,

01:55:22.496 --> 01:55:24.630
she takes a few steps and then with one step,

01:55:24.630 --> 01:55:28.660
you see to the left of her, a boot appear.

01:55:28.660 --> 01:55:30.630
And she takes another step, and a second boot appears.

01:55:30.630 --> 01:55:32.910
They are walking in tandem with her.

01:55:32.910 --> 01:55:35.943
And with each step, you see more and more of the body

01:55:35.943 --> 01:55:38.826
assemble until eventually the green cloak flows,

01:55:38.826 --> 01:55:39.817
the hood up,

01:55:39.817 --> 01:55:41.810
and there by Jester's side,

01:55:41.810 --> 01:55:44.390
the Traveler slowly apparates.

01:55:44.390 --> 01:55:46.274
And as everyone (gasps),

01:55:46.274 --> 01:55:47.660
people begin to bow their head.

01:55:47.660 --> 01:55:49.060
TRAVIS: The Traveler!

01:55:49.060 --> 01:55:50.224
MATT: Whispering and such.

01:55:50.224 --> 01:55:53.230
The Traveler, just barely peeks over towards you, Jester,

01:55:53.230 --> 01:55:55.567
with a smile and goes, "Well done.

01:55:57.499 --> 01:55:58.781
"(clears throat)"

01:55:58.781 --> 01:56:00.014
And you both continue to walk through.

01:56:00.014 --> 01:56:02.930
Are you going along with Jester and the Traveler up this

01:56:02.930 --> 01:56:05.430
path that Caduceus had carved?

01:56:07.040 --> 01:56:10.390
MARISHA: I run security team with Fjord and Caduceus,

01:56:10.390 --> 01:56:12.540
like talked about the night before,

01:56:13.660 --> 01:56:17.571
keeping an eye out for any shenanigans.

01:56:17.571 --> 01:56:18.404
MATT: You've got it.

01:56:18.404 --> 01:56:19.587
MARISHA: But not, like, the good shenanigans.

01:56:19.587 --> 01:56:21.360
Like, the bad ones.
MATT: Okay.

01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:22.951
If I could have both of you make perception checks for me,

01:56:22.951 --> 01:56:24.830
please, if you don't mind.

01:56:24.830 --> 01:56:25.878
MARISHA: Me and Caddy?

01:56:25.878 --> 01:56:27.835
MATT: Mm-hmm.

01:56:27.835 --> 01:56:28.981
TALIESIN: Eh.
MARISHA: 15.

01:56:28.981 --> 01:56:30.255
TALIESIN: 19.
MATT: Okay.

01:56:30.255 --> 01:56:33.670
So you're keeping an eye out as you guys approach.

01:56:33.670 --> 01:56:35.002
The rest of you staying relatively close

01:56:35.002 --> 01:56:36.410
or you're staying to the back to watch

01:56:36.410 --> 01:56:37.790
or keep the group?

01:56:37.790 --> 01:56:40.728
What's the plan, ascending the side of this mountain?

01:56:40.728 --> 01:56:42.095
LAURA: (laughs) That's funny.

01:56:43.070 --> 01:56:44.890
SAM: I'll trail way at the back

01:56:44.890 --> 01:56:49.781
and make sure that nobody falls back too far.

01:56:49.781 --> 01:56:51.065
MATT: Okay.

01:56:51.065 --> 01:56:52.040
ASHLEY: Yeah, same.

01:56:52.040 --> 01:56:53.643
I'll take a little bit of the back.

01:56:53.643 --> 01:56:55.555
SAM: Or wanders off the path.

01:56:55.555 --> 01:56:56.910
TALIESIN: No one gets swallowed.

01:56:56.910 --> 01:57:01.845
MATT: The back of the crowd is rambunctious.

01:57:03.396 --> 01:57:06.246
There are those people at the back.

01:57:06.246 --> 01:57:09.696
You know, the individuals that created a--

01:57:12.111 --> 01:57:13.460
my brain is not working tonight.

01:57:13.460 --> 01:57:14.293
MARISHA: My people.

01:57:14.293 --> 01:57:15.350
MATT: Yeah, there you go.

01:57:15.350 --> 01:57:18.177
Yeah. The individuals-- the term escapes me again--

01:57:18.177 --> 01:57:21.790
who go in and create the party in the back of their truck

01:57:21.790 --> 01:57:23.238
in the parking lot when there wasn't one.

01:57:23.238 --> 01:57:26.104
TRAVIS: Tailgaters.
MATT: Tailgaters, thank you. There you go.

01:57:26.104 --> 01:57:27.720
ASHLEY: Sounds like.
MARISHA: It's a Southern-ass thing.

01:57:27.720 --> 01:57:29.125
That's why.

01:57:29.125 --> 01:57:31.705
SAM: Matt's never gone to a sports game before.

01:57:31.705 --> 01:57:32.964
MATT: I'm having one of those nights.

01:57:32.964 --> 01:57:33.845
But nevertheless.

01:57:33.845 --> 01:57:35.450
Where there was no tailgating parties,

01:57:35.450 --> 01:57:36.283
people brought it

01:57:36.283 --> 01:57:37.449
and they are just rowdy and

01:57:37.449 --> 01:57:39.000
"Woo!"
MARISHA: The kid's table at the wedding.

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:40.631
MATT: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Wow.

01:57:40.631 --> 01:57:43.831
MATT: But thankfully between your guile

01:57:43.831 --> 01:57:45.981
and your... you,

01:57:46.840 --> 01:57:48.240
you manage to muscle them ahead

01:57:48.240 --> 01:57:49.630
and continue them heading up this path.

01:57:49.630 --> 01:57:50.900
A very easy-to-follow a path,

01:57:50.900 --> 01:57:55.190
both because the problematic elements of the stone,

01:57:55.190 --> 01:57:58.690
the jagged volcanic rock that makes the exterior of this

01:57:58.690 --> 01:58:00.770
mountain has been shaped in the places

01:58:00.770 --> 01:58:02.782
where it'd be the most difficult to traverse

01:58:02.782 --> 01:58:05.630
by Caduceus' previous work over the past week

01:58:05.630 --> 01:58:08.240
and the glowing signs and archways

01:58:08.240 --> 01:58:09.860
that Caleb has placed at different points

01:58:09.860 --> 01:58:11.660
that point folks further up this path,

01:58:11.660 --> 01:58:13.845
further up this path.

01:58:13.845 --> 01:58:15.680
LIAM: It was a dick through a crescent moon.

01:58:15.680 --> 01:58:16.513
MATT: Indeed.

01:58:18.770 --> 01:58:21.613
So it is a lively sound,

01:58:22.610 --> 01:58:23.693
almost like a--

01:58:25.556 --> 01:58:29.412
we'll say a very, very pleasantly disorderly

01:58:29.412 --> 01:58:32.803
parade in the middle of Mardi Gras

01:58:32.803 --> 01:58:34.995
making its way up the side of a mountain

01:58:34.995 --> 01:58:38.469
with torchlight and the glow of these symbols

01:58:38.469 --> 01:58:39.730
on a moonless night

01:58:39.730 --> 01:58:42.480
in which the sky itself is mostly clouds.

01:58:42.480 --> 01:58:44.820
You climb your way up towards the top of the volcano.

01:58:44.820 --> 01:58:45.653
And it takes a while.

01:58:45.653 --> 01:58:46.950
And there are some moments people have to stop

01:58:46.950 --> 01:58:48.320
and drink some water.

01:58:48.320 --> 01:58:49.740
Some of the people who were really drunk at the beginning

01:58:49.740 --> 01:58:50.700
are starting to sober up a little bit

01:58:50.700 --> 01:58:53.859
because it's a lot more physical activity
than they were expecting.

01:58:53.859 --> 01:58:56.143
Some people start really complaining, start being like,

01:58:56.143 --> 01:58:57.652
"I didn't know this is what it was gonna be like!"

01:58:57.652 --> 01:59:00.620
"Shut up! It's for the Traveler!"

01:59:00.620 --> 01:59:03.330
It becomes a lot of very unique flavors throughout

01:59:03.330 --> 01:59:04.840
the entirety of this journey up the mountain.

01:59:04.840 --> 01:59:06.225
TRAVIS: The mosquitoes are intense!

01:59:06.225 --> 01:59:07.301
(laughter)

01:59:08.287 --> 01:59:11.687
MATT: Eventually, though, you come upon elements

01:59:11.687 --> 01:59:15.887
of the freshest forms of cooled rock

01:59:15.887 --> 01:59:19.737
from the last vestiges of Vokodo's anger

01:59:19.737 --> 01:59:23.177
that create a new shelf that needs to be climbed,

01:59:23.177 --> 01:59:25.677
but because Caduceus did the footwork,

01:59:25.677 --> 01:59:27.497
there is now a tunnel that leads through

01:59:27.497 --> 01:59:31.457
and carves to the apex of the mountain.

01:59:31.457 --> 01:59:35.077
And so with that, the crowd begins to make its way through,

01:59:35.077 --> 01:59:37.347
to the platform-like top

01:59:37.347 --> 01:59:41.517
that sits along the exterior of the caldera.

01:59:41.517 --> 01:59:42.977
As you all begin to step up, you can see

01:59:42.977 --> 01:59:44.797
the faint bit of smoke and steam

01:59:44.797 --> 01:59:47.217
that does rise from it itself.

01:59:47.217 --> 01:59:50.937
There is a faint orange glow within the mountain,

01:59:50.937 --> 01:59:53.387
and as you begin to step up, and everyone begins

01:59:53.387 --> 01:59:56.981
to disperse a bit amongst the nearby rock,

01:59:56.981 --> 02:00:01.787
it is hotter in this vicinity, but not uncomfortably so.

02:00:01.787 --> 02:00:04.638
You're not getting right up to the edge yet.

02:00:05.627 --> 02:00:07.277
The crowd slowly begin to make their way up.

02:00:07.277 --> 02:00:09.317
You guide them towards the back until eventually

02:00:09.317 --> 02:00:14.317
you have almost 200 people pressed and gathered

02:00:14.847 --> 02:00:19.657
on the outside of this caldera, about, I don't know,

02:00:19.657 --> 02:00:22.187
at this time, traveling up the side of the mountain,

02:00:22.187 --> 02:00:25.530
at that point, you're getting later in the evening,

02:00:26.757 --> 02:00:29.097
pushing 10:30, 11:00 at this point, I'd say,

02:00:29.097 --> 02:00:30.487
just ballparking it.

02:00:30.487 --> 02:00:32.587
LIAM: You said there's cloud cover at this point?

02:00:32.587 --> 02:00:33.420
MATT: There is, yeah.

02:00:33.420 --> 02:00:34.707
I mean, it's broken in some places,

02:00:34.707 --> 02:00:36.847
but there's some heavy clouds going through.

02:00:36.847 --> 02:00:40.387
LIAM: I was walking with Veth and Yasha at the back,

02:00:40.387 --> 02:00:41.927
and once we reach the pinnacle,

02:00:41.927 --> 02:00:44.727
I will cast Programmed Image

02:00:44.727 --> 02:00:48.177
120 feet above the crowd's head.

02:00:48.177 --> 02:00:52.107
The illusion is a parting in the clouds,

02:00:52.107 --> 02:00:54.297
so they're seeing the starry sky,

02:00:54.297 --> 02:00:57.797
and a blue tiefling woman's face materializes

02:00:57.797 --> 02:00:59.827
for a moment, winks at the crowd,

02:00:59.827 --> 02:01:03.627
and then that tiefling face melds into

02:01:03.627 --> 02:01:05.750
a bluish-tinted crescent moon.

02:01:05.750 --> 02:01:08.297
MATT: Now, is this Jester's face, is what you're doing?

02:01:08.297 --> 02:01:09.347
LIAM: Yeah.

02:01:09.347 --> 02:01:10.777
Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

02:01:10.777 --> 02:01:14.757
LIAM: But spectral. You can see through it,

02:01:14.757 --> 02:01:19.757
until it gels into a blue-tinted crescent on its side.

02:01:20.077 --> 02:01:21.407
MATT: Okay.

02:01:21.407 --> 02:01:23.717
So setting that up above about how far?

02:01:23.717 --> 02:01:25.817
LIAM: 120 feet.
MATT: 120 feet, okay.

02:01:25.817 --> 02:01:27.987
LIAM: I'm doing a little bit of--
MATT: Forced perspective.

02:01:27.987 --> 02:01:29.147
LIAM: Yeah, forced perspective.

02:01:29.147 --> 02:01:30.547
MATT: You got it. Okay.

02:01:30.547 --> 02:01:33.327
TRAVIS: As we're walking up, can I nudge up next to Beau

02:01:33.327 --> 02:01:36.157
and say, like: One of us should keep an eye

02:01:36.157 --> 02:01:38.677
on that hoity-toity Celia?

02:01:38.677 --> 02:01:39.801
MARISHA: Oh yeah, that bitch?

02:01:39.801 --> 02:01:40.634
TRAVIS: Yeah, do you see her anywhere?

02:01:40.634 --> 02:01:43.110
I have a terrible--
MARISHA: Do I see her?

02:01:43.110 --> 02:01:44.803
Do I see Celia?

02:01:44.803 --> 02:01:47.306
DM, do I?
MATT: Yeah.

02:01:47.306 --> 02:01:49.167
You scan through the crowd a bit, but you do manage.

02:01:49.167 --> 02:01:50.667
It's less about finding Celia and more

02:01:50.667 --> 02:01:52.928
finding her goliath companion.
MARISHA: The guy, right, right, right.

02:01:52.928 --> 02:01:54.367
MATT: Trudo, he's easier to spot.

02:01:54.367 --> 02:01:55.247
MARISHA: There's Trudo.

02:01:55.247 --> 02:01:58.451
If you look just down, see that little speck of blonde?

02:01:58.451 --> 02:01:59.887
MARISHA: There she is.
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm, okay.

02:01:59.887 --> 02:02:01.947
We should just track that.
MARISHA: I agree.

02:02:01.947 --> 02:02:02.912
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:02:02.912 --> 02:02:03.962
MATT: You glance over, and she's

02:02:03.962 --> 02:02:07.827
facing in towards Trudo, and she's tensing in some way.

02:02:07.827 --> 02:02:09.157
MARISHA: Are they talking?

02:02:09.157 --> 02:02:13.604
MATT: No, he's doing the blocking,

02:02:13.604 --> 02:02:14.742
pressed close to her.

02:02:14.742 --> 02:02:16.637
TRAVIS: Like he doesn't like the crowd, or?

02:02:16.637 --> 02:02:18.290
MARISHA: Like she's embarrassed?

02:02:19.207 --> 02:02:20.737
MATT: Maybe.

02:02:20.737 --> 02:02:22.227
TRAVIS: Her body language is--

02:02:22.227 --> 02:02:23.097
MATT: You see her shoulders,

02:02:23.097 --> 02:02:25.721
she's tensing while facing in towards him.

02:02:25.721 --> 02:02:27.267
MARISHA: (chuckles)

02:02:27.267 --> 02:02:28.100
Okay.

02:02:29.227 --> 02:02:30.060
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:02:31.657 --> 02:02:36.657
I'll keep an eye on her and you stay with Jester.

02:02:36.687 --> 02:02:37.520
MATT: Okay.

02:02:37.520 --> 02:02:38.837
MARISHA: Okay.

02:02:38.837 --> 02:02:42.937
So I will watch Jester's relativity in the crowd.

02:02:42.937 --> 02:02:44.197
MATT: You got it.
MARISHA: Be her bodyguard.

02:02:44.197 --> 02:02:47.137
If anyone moves on Jester, like Secret Service-style,

02:02:47.137 --> 02:02:48.047
fucking going after them.

02:02:48.047 --> 02:02:49.897
TRAVIS: And I'll actually use Mask of Many Faces

02:02:49.897 --> 02:02:52.047
to change the way I look and

02:02:53.197 --> 02:02:56.234
sidle up next to-- slowly move towards Celia

02:02:56.234 --> 02:02:58.597
and just keep that distance.

02:02:58.597 --> 02:03:00.203
MATT: You got it.
LAURA: And then as we're going up,

02:03:00.203 --> 02:03:01.361
as we're standing there,

02:03:01.361 --> 02:03:05.057
I'm assuming I have some moment to whisper to the Traveler.

02:03:05.057 --> 02:03:06.217
MATT: You do, you guys arrived first,

02:03:06.217 --> 02:03:08.047
and it takes a while for folks to spread out

02:03:08.047 --> 02:03:10.667
and it's not like it's flat ground here.

02:03:10.667 --> 02:03:12.767
It has some rockiness to it, and you guys

02:03:12.767 --> 02:03:14.767
are standing at the precipice,

02:03:14.767 --> 02:03:17.925
where the folks are gathering 10, 15 feet

02:03:17.925 --> 02:03:21.507
down the incline, and spreading out

02:03:21.507 --> 02:03:23.727
in this larger shelf where it'd be the easiest place

02:03:23.727 --> 02:03:25.917
for that many people to gather safely.

02:03:25.917 --> 02:03:26.750
LAURA: Okay.

02:03:27.817 --> 02:03:29.167
So what's the plan, Artie?

02:03:29.167 --> 02:03:32.417
Like, are we waiting till the last person has thrown it in

02:03:32.417 --> 02:03:34.447
before we give the big reveal?

02:03:34.447 --> 02:03:36.457
MATT: "I would imagine so, otherwise they're just

02:03:36.457 --> 02:03:38.925
"left holding their dicks in their hands."

02:03:38.925 --> 02:03:43.223
(laughter)

02:03:43.223 --> 02:03:46.794
LAURA: Is it going to be you? Are you going to do it?

02:03:46.794 --> 02:03:48.907
Are you going to, like, turn into her?

02:03:48.907 --> 02:03:49.832
MATT: "I'm planning to, yes."

02:03:49.832 --> 02:03:51.248
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

02:03:51.248 --> 02:03:53.624
MATT: "This should be a performance, a presentation."

02:03:53.624 --> 02:03:54.457
LAURA: Well, yeah.

02:03:54.457 --> 02:03:55.707
MATT: "You and me can speak back and forth.

02:03:55.707 --> 02:03:57.147
"Just riffing off of each other."

02:03:57.147 --> 02:03:58.788
LAURA: I love it, okay.
MATT: "You begin the introduction,

02:03:58.788 --> 02:04:01.055
"I'll begin to speak, and we'll just throw it back and forth

02:04:01.055 --> 02:04:02.667
"and see where it takes us."

02:04:02.667 --> 02:04:04.457
LAURA: I love this.
MATT: "All right, all right.

02:04:04.457 --> 02:04:08.049
"I'm excited. (chuckles)

02:04:08.049 --> 02:04:09.867
"(exhales) All right."

02:04:09.867 --> 02:04:11.677
LAURA: Welcome, one and all.

02:04:11.677 --> 02:04:14.270
MATT: And your voice carries.

02:04:15.156 --> 02:04:18.037
There is an enhancement. Like, Thaumaturgy gives you

02:04:18.037 --> 02:04:20.887
a little bit of volume, but this, as you speak,

02:04:20.887 --> 02:04:23.787
and you guys catch this, Jester's voice is omnipresent.

02:04:23.787 --> 02:04:26.687
It seems to almost erupt from the very rock

02:04:26.687 --> 02:04:28.397
you're standing on around you.

02:04:28.397 --> 02:04:31.594
It is pretty cool, as she'd say.

02:04:31.594 --> 02:04:34.127
(laughter)

02:04:34.127 --> 02:04:38.230
LAURA: The Traveler, as you can see, is pleased.

02:04:39.337 --> 02:04:44.097
If you would one at a time-- you last, Blondie--

02:04:44.097 --> 02:04:47.357
come up and throw your recently procured dicks

02:04:47.357 --> 02:04:52.357
into the volcano, so that our ceremony may commence.

02:04:52.527 --> 02:04:53.460
MATT: "Indeed.

02:04:54.587 --> 02:04:57.895
"With each gift

02:04:57.895 --> 02:05:01.378
"of these finely crafted instruments,

02:05:03.097 --> 02:05:05.188
"the volcano symbolizes

02:05:06.189 --> 02:05:09.114
"the destruction of things

02:05:10.247 --> 02:05:14.517
"not yours and reborn into..."

02:05:14.517 --> 02:05:16.549
(whispering) "I'm having a hard time following this one."

02:05:16.549 --> 02:05:18.094
SAM: What do the dicks represent?

02:05:18.094 --> 02:05:20.397
LAURA: The dicks represent...

02:05:20.397 --> 02:05:21.887
MATT: "We should have gone over this.

02:05:21.887 --> 02:05:24.072
"That's my fault for not asking."
LAURA: (whispering) No, it's okay.

02:05:24.072 --> 02:05:25.547
(normal volume) The dicks represent

02:05:26.996 --> 02:05:30.647
our tie to this material world.

02:05:30.647 --> 02:05:35.417
What we hold dear here on Exandria.

02:05:35.417 --> 02:05:37.037
TRAVIS: Exandria, yeah.

02:05:37.037 --> 02:05:38.747
What we hold dear.

02:05:38.747 --> 02:05:42.447
LAURA: By giving up your dick to the volcano,

02:05:42.447 --> 02:05:46.287
you are showing your commitment to helping the Traveler

02:05:46.287 --> 02:05:48.040
attain his greatness.

02:05:48.987 --> 02:05:50.377
MATT: "And let's be honest.

02:05:50.377 --> 02:05:54.652
"How many of you are from the Dwendalian Empire?"

02:05:54.652 --> 02:05:57.618
A number of hands raise.
SAM: Ah!

02:05:57.618 --> 02:05:58.451
LIAM: Woot.

02:05:59.647 --> 02:06:01.196
MATT: "Down with the patriarchy."

02:06:01.196 --> 02:06:02.462
LAURA: (laughs)

02:06:02.462 --> 02:06:07.404
(forced laughter)

02:06:08.955 --> 02:06:10.313
LAURA: Okay, okay, let's get it started.

02:06:10.313 --> 02:06:12.187
All right, all right. First dick.

02:06:12.187 --> 02:06:14.230
You, come on up here, throw it in.

02:06:15.941 --> 02:06:19.365
MATT: Everyone kind of like, "Uh."
One by one, they all, just kind of confused,

02:06:19.365 --> 02:06:21.995
start ascending the pathway.
MARISHA: What's the message here?

02:06:23.295 --> 02:06:24.821
So confused.

02:06:24.821 --> 02:06:26.054
MATT: So's he.

02:06:26.054 --> 02:06:27.777
(laughter)

02:06:27.777 --> 02:06:28.900
LAURA: I love it.

02:06:28.900 --> 02:06:30.837
MATT: One by one, people start taking it and lobbing.

02:06:30.837 --> 02:06:32.701
Some people throw it, it doesn't quite go far enough

02:06:32.701 --> 02:06:34.000
and they have to rush up and pick it up again

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:35.391
and throw again.

02:06:36.345 --> 02:06:38.927
And because it's one by one, every person takes,

02:06:38.927 --> 02:06:40.877
from the climb to the throw to the exit,

02:06:40.877 --> 02:06:43.347
roughly a minute or so, so you're there for like

02:06:43.347 --> 02:06:44.287
two more hours--

02:06:44.287 --> 02:06:45.217
LAURA: Oh my god.

02:06:45.217 --> 02:06:47.477
MATT: -- as one by one, in silence--

02:06:47.477 --> 02:06:48.757
LAURA: All right, all right.

02:06:48.757 --> 02:06:51.237
I'm going to start going: All right, come on.
MATT: The rushing of--

02:06:51.237 --> 02:06:53.197
LAURA: Speed it up, people, speed it up.

02:06:54.426 --> 02:06:57.178
TRAVIS: You see dicks flying from way in the back.

02:06:57.178 --> 02:06:59.417
LAURA: Multiples, multiples. Just throw them in.

02:06:59.417 --> 02:07:00.547
MATT: It's great too because there's an arc

02:07:00.547 --> 02:07:01.980
and then a little (poof).

02:07:04.643 --> 02:07:07.387
LAURA: We got everyone? Celia, got your golden dick?

02:07:07.387 --> 02:07:08.950
MATT: The Traveler starts doing this

02:07:08.950 --> 02:07:11.177
with his finger, and you start hearing music playing,

02:07:11.177 --> 02:07:13.435
like fine violin music.

02:07:13.435 --> 02:07:15.197
SAM: Play them off.
MATT: "Yes, yes.

02:07:15.197 --> 02:07:17.315
"Joy be unto all of you. Come, come.

02:07:17.315 --> 02:07:19.989
"Throw your previous...

02:07:20.948 --> 02:07:23.117
"connections to this mortal world

02:07:23.117 --> 02:07:25.267
"into the fire and be reborn in the light

02:07:25.267 --> 02:07:29.047
"of the Traveler, light of tonight's moon."

02:07:29.047 --> 02:07:31.388
LAURA: This, the big moon above.

02:07:31.388 --> 02:07:33.457
MATT: "Moon above. Yes."

02:07:33.457 --> 02:07:35.497
LAURA: Tricky, tricky moon.

02:07:35.497 --> 02:07:37.544
(laughter)

02:07:37.544 --> 02:07:39.810
MARISHA: (wheezing) This is such a disaster.

02:07:39.810 --> 02:07:42.017
(laughter)

02:07:42.017 --> 02:07:45.049
MATT: Slowly it dwindles down to the final moments

02:07:47.348 --> 02:07:49.804
until it is just Celia there at the end.

02:07:49.804 --> 02:07:51.347
LAURA: Come on, Celia, we're waiting for you.

02:07:51.347 --> 02:07:54.190
SAM: Speech! Speech!

02:07:55.157 --> 02:07:57.897
MATT: "Indeed, the winner, the one who found

02:07:57.897 --> 02:07:59.413
"the golden phallus

02:07:59.413 --> 02:08:03.307
"granted by the high priestess herself,

02:08:03.307 --> 02:08:04.702
"the glory of throwing--"
LAURA: Your favorite!

02:08:04.702 --> 02:08:07.247
My voice carries.

02:08:07.247 --> 02:08:08.627
Your favorite.

02:08:08.627 --> 02:08:10.125
MATT: "My favorite.

02:08:11.627 --> 02:08:16.297
"The high priestess gifted upon this one the golden phallus.

02:08:16.297 --> 02:08:20.127
"Now, please step forth and show us all how it is done,

"Celia."

02:08:22.327 --> 02:08:23.927
And she looks over.

02:08:23.927 --> 02:08:25.431
"I'm all right.

02:08:25.431 --> 02:08:28.057
"There's been plenty of dicks thrown tonight.

02:08:28.057 --> 02:08:28.967
"I'll just..."

02:08:30.017 --> 02:08:32.937
LAURA: Come on, Celia, we got to finish the ceremony,

02:08:32.937 --> 02:08:34.455
this is important, come on.

02:08:34.455 --> 02:08:36.559
(laughter)

02:08:36.559 --> 02:08:38.297
MATT: (sighs)

02:08:38.297 --> 02:08:42.897
She steps up in her finely-tailored leather boots

02:08:42.897 --> 02:08:44.127
and her little waistcoat.

02:08:44.127 --> 02:08:45.507
ALL: Throw that dick!

02:08:45.507 --> 02:08:47.277
Throw that dick!

02:08:47.277 --> 02:08:49.945
MATT: She approaches the edge, her--

02:08:49.945 --> 02:08:52.452
(laughs)

02:08:52.452 --> 02:08:53.707
--shorter blonde hair

02:08:53.707 --> 02:08:55.697
pushed over to one side.

02:08:55.697 --> 02:08:57.137
The wind that's picking up, the hot wind

02:08:57.137 --> 02:08:58.497
from inside the volcano caldera,

02:08:58.497 --> 02:09:01.097
pushing it against her sweaty face,

02:09:01.097 --> 02:09:03.897
the under orange light glow.

02:09:03.897 --> 02:09:05.507
She (breathing heavily),

02:09:05.507 --> 02:09:06.647
her eyes look over somewhat nervously

02:09:06.647 --> 02:09:09.307
towards the Traveler, and he goes,

02:09:09.307 --> 02:09:11.892
"Trust in me, child."

02:09:14.457 --> 02:09:15.837
She nods and smiles,

02:09:15.837 --> 02:09:18.087
and with her other hand, wipes

02:09:18.087 --> 02:09:20.323
the hair from her face and goes, "Of course."
MARISHA: Okay, am I watching this?

02:09:20.323 --> 02:09:21.230
MATT: You are.

02:09:21.230 --> 02:09:22.807
MARISHA: I can read their lips?

02:09:22.807 --> 02:09:23.957
Because I've got Observant?

02:09:23.957 --> 02:09:25.007
MATT: Yes.

02:09:25.007 --> 02:09:27.859
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to start just moving my way closer.

02:09:27.859 --> 02:09:29.287
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: Okay.

02:09:29.287 --> 02:09:32.550
MATT: She goes, "You're right. I trust you."

02:09:34.547 --> 02:09:36.070
There's a silence and a hush.

02:09:36.907 --> 02:09:41.550
She looks down at the golden phallus in her palm,

02:09:42.817 --> 02:09:46.008
clutches it with finality, clenches her jaw--

02:09:46.008 --> 02:09:46.841
MARISHA: Jester.

02:09:46.841 --> 02:09:48.137
MATT: -- and goes into a run
MARISHA: No, no!

02:09:48.137 --> 02:09:49.621
MATT: -- towards the volcano.

02:09:49.621 --> 02:09:52.432
MARISHA: I run after her and I'm
going to fucking tackle her!

02:09:52.432 --> 02:09:54.210
(laughter)

02:09:54.210 --> 02:09:56.010
ASHLEY: I start making a run for it.

02:09:56.010 --> 02:09:58.122
LAURA: What?! What are you doing?!

02:09:58.122 --> 02:09:58.991
MATT: Okay.

02:09:58.991 --> 02:09:59.890
LAURA: Beau!

02:09:59.890 --> 02:10:01.877
SAM: We're protecting!
MATT: Okay.

02:10:01.877 --> 02:10:02.727
Okay.

02:10:02.727 --> 02:10:05.217
As she begins running towards the edge of the volcano

02:10:05.217 --> 02:10:07.887
with the golden phallus in her hand,

02:10:07.887 --> 02:10:10.017
you and Yasha, who are very fast, rush up

02:10:10.897 --> 02:10:14.045
and both make an athletics checks for me, please.

02:10:14.045 --> 02:10:15.503
(laughter)

02:10:15.503 --> 02:10:16.911
LIAM: I like personal safety.

02:10:16.911 --> 02:10:18.597
TRAVIS: You're going to kill her! (laughs)

02:10:18.597 --> 02:10:20.319
Because you glued a dick to her hand!

02:10:20.319 --> 02:10:21.560
SAM: Gun, gun, gun!

02:10:21.560 --> 02:10:23.459
ASHLEY: Is she jumping in?
MARISHA: Is she jumping?

02:10:23.459 --> 02:10:24.527
SAM: No! She's not jumping in.

02:10:24.527 --> 02:10:26.560
MATT: She's getting a running start to throw.

02:10:26.560 --> 02:10:27.543
SAM: She's trying to throw the thing.

02:10:27.543 --> 02:10:29.245
MATT: But go for it.

02:10:29.245 --> 02:10:31.032
(laughter)

02:10:31.032 --> 02:10:33.952
MARISHA: Oh no, I rolled a natural 18.

02:10:33.952 --> 02:10:35.545
MATT: Okay.
ASHLEY: 11.

02:10:35.545 --> 02:10:36.787
MARISHA: 26.

02:10:36.787 --> 02:10:38.277
MATT: She hustles past you and then--

02:10:38.277 --> 02:10:39.887
SAM: Shooter, shooter!

02:10:39.887 --> 02:10:43.251
MATT: -- gets tackled into the rock by Beauregard,

02:10:43.251 --> 02:10:45.364
and everyone's like, "Wha-- whoa!"

02:10:45.364 --> 02:10:46.727
in the crowd. They're all watching.

02:10:46.727 --> 02:10:47.977
TRAVIS: Full-on tackle?
MATT: Yep.

02:10:49.537 --> 02:10:50.827
TRAVIS: Decleater.

02:10:50.827 --> 02:10:52.888
MATT: She's on the ground coughing.

02:10:52.888 --> 02:10:54.038
LAURA: Beau, what is--
MARISHA: You were going to fucking jump?

02:10:54.038 --> 02:10:55.088
LAURA: What are you doing?
SAM: Beau, what happened?

02:10:55.088 --> 02:10:55.921
MARISHA: Shut up, shut up!

02:10:55.921 --> 02:10:57.767
Were you going to jump?

02:10:57.767 --> 02:10:58.928
MATT: "No, of course--!"

02:10:58.928 --> 02:11:01.179
MARISHA: What the fuck? What's your deal?

02:11:01.179 --> 02:11:03.077
MATT: "I was doing what everyone else was doing."

02:11:03.927 --> 02:11:05.847
LAURA: Beau, she's the final dick.

02:11:05.847 --> 02:11:06.697
It's important.

02:11:06.697 --> 02:11:07.860
MATT: "<i>I'm the final dick.</i>"

02:11:09.527 --> 02:11:11.827
MARISHA: Don't throw yourself into the volcano, okay?

02:11:12.917 --> 02:11:13.750
MATT: "Okay."

02:11:13.750 --> 02:11:15.607
MARISHA: You weren't going to throw y-- don't do that.

02:11:15.607 --> 02:11:16.440
MATT: "No."

02:11:16.440 --> 02:11:18.021
MARISHA: And if you fucking fuck with any of this shit--

02:11:18.021 --> 02:11:20.057
MATT: Her face is scraped up on one side

02:11:20.057 --> 02:11:22.707
from where she hit the volcanic rock when she fell.

02:11:22.707 --> 02:11:23.540
MARISHA: Okay.

02:11:24.780 --> 02:11:27.138
I might've misinterpreted your actions.

02:11:27.138 --> 02:11:29.805
(laughter)

02:11:29.805 --> 02:11:30.977
ASHLEY: I thought she was going to run and jump in,

02:11:30.977 --> 02:11:33.217
I was like, I'll fly in and grab her.

02:11:33.217 --> 02:11:34.267
TALIESIN: That's fair.

02:11:35.135 --> 02:11:36.855
(laughter)

02:11:36.855 --> 02:11:38.032
MARISHA: Okay, do your thing.

02:11:38.032 --> 02:11:43.007
(laughter)

02:11:45.894 --> 02:11:48.604
TRAVIS: Just for the practice.

02:11:48.604 --> 02:11:53.537
(laughter)

02:11:56.225 --> 02:11:58.176
MATT: I'm so happy!

02:11:58.176 --> 02:11:59.461
(laughter)

02:11:59.461 --> 02:12:02.337
MATT: Traveler Con is everything I wanted it to be!

02:12:02.337 --> 02:12:05.997
LIAM: Caleb from the back casts Major Image again

02:12:05.997 --> 02:12:10.257
and from out of nowhere, green curtains just close

02:12:10.257 --> 02:12:11.961
in front of them.

02:12:11.961 --> 02:12:15.157
MATT: As you help her back up.
MARISHA: I help her back up.

02:12:15.157 --> 02:12:16.307
MATT: There's scrapes.

02:12:17.707 --> 02:12:18.540
Pulls away.

02:12:21.037 --> 02:12:23.394
Steps back to where she started.

02:12:23.394 --> 02:12:24.813
MARISHA: Sorry.

02:12:24.813 --> 02:12:25.896
Sorry.

02:12:27.197 --> 02:12:29.335
Throw that dick.

02:12:29.335 --> 02:12:31.277
MARISHA and LAURA: (chanting) Throw the dick!

02:12:31.277 --> 02:12:32.380
MATT: She runs again.

02:12:34.537 --> 02:12:37.030
Throws, and it doesn't go.

02:12:37.030 --> 02:12:38.628
(laughter)

02:12:38.628 --> 02:12:41.107
MATT: And she tries again, and it doesn't go.

02:12:41.107 --> 02:12:44.067
She tries again and again and again,

02:12:44.067 --> 02:12:45.357
and at this point, all the energy's

02:12:45.357 --> 02:12:46.437
deflated out of the moment.

02:12:46.437 --> 02:12:48.756
LIAM: This is such a 2020 mood.

02:12:48.756 --> 02:12:50.167
(laughter)

02:12:50.167 --> 02:12:54.887
MATT: She looks back at the Traveler, and he goes, "Gotcha."

02:12:54.887 --> 02:12:56.418
(laughter)

02:12:56.418 --> 02:12:57.251
"Ah!"

02:12:57.251 --> 02:12:59.477
LAURA: I'm going to walk up to
Celia and pat her on the shoulder

02:12:59.477 --> 02:13:02.570
and say: I hope you enjoy your present.

02:13:03.427 --> 02:13:07.270
It will last you for your entire life.

02:13:10.127 --> 02:13:13.670
MATT: And she just storms down the ramp, in your direction.

02:13:15.458 --> 02:13:18.465
TALIESIN: We've all made an enemy
that will kill us all tonight.

02:13:18.465 --> 02:13:19.760
She'll be the end of us.
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:13:21.770 --> 02:13:23.557
MATT: The girl with the golden dick.

02:13:25.367 --> 02:13:26.477
The best Bond villain,

02:13:26.477 --> 02:13:27.577
MARISHA: Cynthia Dickfingers.

02:13:28.617 --> 02:13:31.921
SAM: How appropriate to consecrate this event

02:13:31.921 --> 02:13:34.387
with a great prank!

02:13:34.387 --> 02:13:37.410
LAURA: Exactly.
MATT: "Indeed."

02:13:37.410 --> 02:13:38.507
SAM: Hey!

02:13:38.507 --> 02:13:40.737
MATT: Now at that, everyone goes,

02:13:40.737 --> 02:13:43.647
starts cheering loudly, as Celia just

02:13:43.647 --> 02:13:44.977
pushes through the crowd and makes her way

02:13:44.977 --> 02:13:46.877
down the mountain alone, with Trudo

02:13:46.877 --> 02:13:48.016
catching up to her.

02:13:48.016 --> 02:13:49.167
LAURA: Can you make it look like green fire's

02:13:49.167 --> 02:13:50.757
coming out the volcano?

02:13:50.757 --> 02:13:51.590
Behind us?

02:13:51.590 --> 02:13:53.899
TRAVIS: Major Image, green fire, behind us,

02:13:53.899 --> 02:13:55.399
coming out of the volcano.
LAURA: Yeah.

02:13:56.377 --> 02:13:59.335
And as the fire grows, I say:

02:14:00.435 --> 02:14:02.127
Now is the moment

02:14:02.127 --> 02:14:04.757
that you've all been waiting for,

02:14:04.757 --> 02:14:09.007
where the Traveler will show us

02:14:09.007 --> 02:14:11.115
what he truly is.

02:14:11.115 --> 02:14:13.887
Who he truly can be

02:14:13.887 --> 02:14:17.436
because of all of your commitment.

02:14:21.187 --> 02:14:22.937
MATT: The rock quakes for just a moment

02:14:22.937 --> 02:14:25.387
and the Traveler stands there, puts his arms out,

02:14:26.967 --> 02:14:29.130
and he reaches up and pulls the hood back,

02:14:30.417 --> 02:14:33.867
and as the shadows unveil, you see this

02:14:34.777 --> 02:14:38.570
fair, somewhat sky blue skin,

02:14:40.147 --> 02:14:45.147
this pale white hair that tumbles past the shoulders,

02:14:45.407 --> 02:14:47.677
and as the cloak falls away, you can see beneath

02:14:47.677 --> 02:14:51.055
these beautiful robes on a feminine form.

02:14:53.387 --> 02:14:55.497
The voice emerges once more, but is different

02:14:55.497 --> 02:14:56.797
than the Traveler's.

02:14:58.757 --> 02:15:00.130
"My apologies.

02:15:02.507 --> 02:15:04.477
"But this was the only way to guide you all

02:15:04.477 --> 02:15:06.138
"to the right path.

02:15:08.017 --> 02:15:12.358
"The Traveler is but one aspect of myself."

02:15:14.775 --> 02:15:15.608
"Right."
LAURA: Yeah.

02:15:15.608 --> 02:15:20.357
I'm going to take off my cloak and bow next to ... her

02:15:20.357 --> 02:15:21.945
and take her hand.

02:15:24.507 --> 02:15:27.267
MATT: "I've guided you all here, for I wished you all

02:15:27.267 --> 02:15:30.717
"to be the first to know

02:15:30.717 --> 02:15:34.842
"that a new avatar to the Moon Weaver,

02:15:34.842 --> 02:15:39.842
"Sehanine, walks amongst you, and has guided you all

02:15:39.930 --> 02:15:43.127
"to find each other, to find community

02:15:44.137 --> 02:15:47.187
"in the light of the moon," and gestures up

02:15:47.187 --> 02:15:48.537
towards the illusion, and everyone

02:15:48.537 --> 02:15:50.220
looks up towards it. (gasps)

02:15:52.947 --> 02:15:54.820
LAURA: I'll stand up next to her.

02:15:56.919 --> 02:15:57.752
You.

02:15:58.663 --> 02:16:00.740
You are the chosen few.

02:16:01.657 --> 02:16:06.532
The Moon Weaver has found us to lead her new sect.

02:16:07.387 --> 02:16:09.160
How special you are!

02:16:11.709 --> 02:16:13.314
MATT: "All of you.

02:16:13.314 --> 02:16:15.092
"All of you are my chosen.

02:16:16.537 --> 02:16:18.528
"And all that I ask

02:16:20.336 --> 02:16:24.269
"is that you give your lives

02:16:25.307 --> 02:16:30.273
"of prayer and piety to the night sky."

02:16:32.237 --> 02:16:34.387
LAURA: Let chaos reign.

02:16:34.387 --> 02:16:38.657
MATT: "Yes, let chaos reign."

02:16:38.657 --> 02:16:42.145
(as crowd) "Let chaos reign. Let chaos reign."
ALL: Let chaos reign.

02:16:43.137 --> 02:16:46.096
MATT: (as crowd member) "Why didn't you
just tell us at the beginning?"

02:16:46.096 --> 02:16:48.297
(laughter)

02:16:48.297 --> 02:16:52.077
(as Artagan) "Because indeed, as the goddess of trickery,

02:16:52.077 --> 02:16:54.937
"is it not the greatest trick to have convinced you

02:16:54.937 --> 02:16:56.485
"I was something else?"

02:16:57.372 --> 02:16:59.645
MATT: (muttering)

02:16:59.645 --> 02:17:01.567
LAURA: She's good.

02:17:01.567 --> 02:17:04.017
MATT: (as other crowd member) "That's right, shut up, Stan."

02:17:04.017 --> 02:17:05.687
(as Stan) "Jesus, I didn't..."

02:17:05.687 --> 02:17:07.597
TALIESIN: Jesus, Stan, God, come on.

02:17:07.597 --> 02:17:12.597
MATT: (as Artagan) "But it is here that
I wanted you all to find each other,

02:17:13.597 --> 02:17:17.756
"and know that even if I cannot be here for all of you,

02:17:17.756 --> 02:17:21.313
"I will always be watching in the night sky."

02:17:22.187 --> 02:17:27.003
At that moment, the moon illusion vanishes.

02:17:27.003 --> 02:17:27.836
MARISHA: Uh-oh.

02:17:28.697 --> 02:17:31.730
MATT: The clouds off to the side begin to part.

02:17:34.497 --> 02:17:35.987
LAURA: Oh no.

02:17:35.987 --> 02:17:40.577
MATT: And you see a full white moon

02:17:40.577 --> 02:17:42.988
behind where the clouds separate.

02:17:44.437 --> 02:17:46.527
Where there shouldn't be one.

02:17:46.527 --> 02:17:49.068
Everyone goes, (gasps) wow!

02:17:49.068 --> 02:17:50.408
LAURA: Gotcha again.

02:17:50.408 --> 02:17:52.217
(laughs)

02:17:52.217 --> 02:17:54.341
MATT: You watch as the Traveler looks at you and goes,

02:17:54.341 --> 02:17:55.474
"I didn't do that."
LAURA: What is this?

02:17:55.474 --> 02:17:56.783
MATT: "I didn't do that."

02:17:56.783 --> 02:17:57.616
SAM: What?

02:17:59.397 --> 02:18:01.297
MATT: "Indeed--
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

02:18:01.297 --> 02:18:05.137
MATT: "-- a great--" and you see as these beams of moonlight

02:18:05.137 --> 02:18:09.207
cascade down past the open parting of the clouds,

02:18:09.207 --> 02:18:11.947
these gossamer silver strings,

02:18:11.947 --> 02:18:16.947
like beams that turn into white chains

02:18:17.217 --> 02:18:21.087
and (whooshing) rush towards the Traveler,

02:18:21.087 --> 02:18:23.335
wrapping around. "(cries out) I--"

02:18:23.335 --> 02:18:24.168
LAURA: No!

02:18:25.768 --> 02:18:26.927
Can I hold onto him?

02:18:26.927 --> 02:18:28.907
MATT: Yeah, you go ahead and grab on

02:18:28.907 --> 02:18:30.207
MARISHA: Jester.

02:18:30.207 --> 02:18:31.151
SAM: Oh!

02:18:32.426 --> 02:18:35.137
MATT: "My ascension is at hand.

02:18:35.137 --> 02:18:36.701
"(aside) What is happening? What is happening?"

02:18:36.701 --> 02:18:38.901
LAURA: What's happening? Stop it!

02:18:38.901 --> 02:18:40.407
MATT: You see a shape begin to descend

02:18:40.407 --> 02:18:42.817
and you see these white wings.

02:18:42.817 --> 02:18:44.107
SAM: Use the hand.

02:18:44.107 --> 02:18:47.483
MATT: And you see a feminine figure of blue skin,

02:18:48.778 --> 02:18:52.107
angelic in visage, silver hair,

02:18:52.107 --> 02:18:56.127
but in a long mohawk that drifts behind,

02:18:56.127 --> 02:18:58.327
and these flowing robes, blue skin,

02:18:58.327 --> 02:19:02.137
very reminiscent of the symbols and the descriptors

02:19:02.137 --> 02:19:05.547
of aspects of the Moon Weaver, Sehanine herself,

02:19:05.547 --> 02:19:09.847
flies down, sword at one side, whip on the other,

02:19:09.847 --> 02:19:14.147
and as the hand's extended, this feminine form's voice

02:19:14.147 --> 02:19:17.727
shakes out louder than yours and the Traveler's combined

02:19:17.727 --> 02:19:19.777
around the top of this mountain and says,

02:19:20.667 --> 02:19:25.045
"This being speaks in absolute falsehoods.

02:19:26.417 --> 02:19:29.114
"It does not represent the Moon Weaver

02:19:30.367 --> 02:19:33.872
"or any of her divine children.

02:19:35.247 --> 02:19:39.277
"Misdirection and bold lies hold different sides

02:19:39.277 --> 02:19:42.390
"to a mortal and moral coin.

02:19:44.027 --> 02:19:48.687
"This one lies and has lied to you all for some time.

02:19:48.687 --> 02:19:51.407
"It would seem." As it descends,

02:19:51.407 --> 02:19:53.237
the white chains wrapped around.

02:19:53.237 --> 02:19:57.067
You watch as the visage begins to vanish of the Moon Weaver

02:19:57.067 --> 02:20:01.990
and now back to the tangled orange-red hair of the Traveler.

02:20:02.837 --> 02:20:04.497
(as Artagan) "I've done nothing of the kind.

02:20:04.497 --> 02:20:06.367
"I've been very upfront with these people.

02:20:06.367 --> 02:20:08.877
"I was trying to do you a--" and the chains now

02:20:08.877 --> 02:20:11.640
wrap around his mouth. (muffled words)

02:20:13.598 --> 02:20:15.573
You see him struggling.
LAURA: Please!

02:20:15.573 --> 02:20:17.257
MATT: You've never seen the Traveler this helpless before.

02:20:17.257 --> 02:20:19.587
LAURA: Please, please?

02:20:19.587 --> 02:20:23.188
He was just bringing you some new followers is all.

02:20:24.467 --> 02:20:29.358
MATT: "This one, known as Artagan,

02:20:29.358 --> 02:20:34.350
"is a wily renegade, having fled from his binds before.

02:20:35.437 --> 02:20:37.890
"While she can appreciate trickery,

02:20:38.777 --> 02:20:42.682
"she will not stand for terror done in her name."

02:20:45.227 --> 02:20:47.187
You watch as the chains tighten

02:20:47.187 --> 02:20:49.417
and he begins to be pulled up into the air

02:20:49.417 --> 02:20:52.430
towards this entity.

02:20:53.467 --> 02:20:57.807
"He will be dragged back to the fey where he once came

02:20:57.807 --> 02:21:00.747
"and we'll deal with his transgressions there,

02:21:00.747 --> 02:21:04.257
"as was intended by his brethren."

02:21:05.797 --> 02:21:06.954
And that's where we're going to take a break.

02:21:06.954 --> 02:21:08.408
(shouting)

02:21:08.408 --> 02:21:09.683
MARISHA: Oh shit!

02:21:11.065 --> 02:21:12.623
Oh my god!

02:21:14.002 --> 02:21:16.409
LIAM: That planar being is stealing your fake god!

02:21:16.409 --> 02:21:18.675
LAURA: (shouting)
MARISHA: Holy shit!

02:21:18.675 --> 02:21:19.887
MATT: So we're going to come back
here in just a few minutes,

02:21:19.887 --> 02:21:20.878
We're going to take a quick break

02:21:20.878 --> 02:21:22.441
and we'll see you guys here shortly.

02:21:22.441 --> 02:21:24.157
LAURA: Oh boy, oh boy.
MARISHA: Artagan.

In the world of Critical Role's Exandria,

02:22:16.683 --> 02:22:18.543
a fresh conflict threatens to tear

02:22:18.543 --> 02:22:20.513
the continent of Wildemount apart

02:22:20.513 --> 02:22:24.603
as the Dwendalian empire and Kryn dynasty prepare for war.

02:22:24.603 --> 02:22:27.053
Hidden in this vast landscape are secrets that could

02:22:27.053 --> 02:22:30.003
end the conflict and usher in a new age of peace,

02:22:30.003 --> 02:22:32.083
or burn the world to a cinder.

Hey Critters, Laura Bailey here.

02:23:13.793 --> 02:23:16.226
Let's see what's up in the Critical Role shop.

02:23:17.723 --> 02:23:19.433
Ooh, look at this.

02:23:19.433 --> 02:23:21.566
Look at the details, oooh.

02:23:24.193 --> 02:23:26.166
It's so cute. I can't handle it.

02:23:28.863 --> 02:23:31.113
Darling, I recommend buying two.

02:23:31.113 --> 02:23:34.543
One for you and another for you.

02:23:34.543 --> 02:23:35.496
Let's be honest.

02:23:37.053 --> 02:23:39.383
You're only like five clicks away from owning this.

02:23:39.383 --> 02:23:41.653
Maybe more, if you have a lot of windows

02:23:41.653 --> 02:23:44.156
open on your browser, I don't know your life.

02:23:45.843 --> 02:23:47.803
This is, this is a lot of stuff, you guys.

02:23:47.803 --> 02:23:51.430
We have like so many cool things right now.

02:23:51.430 --> 02:23:55.476
All this and more, now available in the Critical Role shop.

02:23:55.476 --> 02:23:57.976

02:24:01.245 --> 02:24:04.245 line:20%
(rock guitar music)

02:24:07.424 --> 02:24:08.458
(cheering)

02:24:08.458 --> 02:24:10.123
Yeah, we did!

02:24:10.123 --> 02:24:10.956
Yeah!

02:24:10.956 --> 02:24:12.743
Sam Riegel, you just won the Super Bowl.

02:24:12.743 --> 02:24:13.873
What are you going to do now?

02:24:13.873 --> 02:24:17.173
I'm subscribing to Critical Role!

02:24:17.173 --> 02:24:18.006
Wonderful. And that's-

02:24:18.006 --> 02:24:20.223
It's about perseverance, like remembering

02:24:20.223 --> 02:24:22.951
to resubscribe with Twitch Prime every month.

02:24:22.951 --> 02:24:23.784
Yeah!

02:24:23.784 --> 02:24:25.103
Well, could you-

02:24:25.103 --> 02:24:26.463
Have done it without my teammates?

02:24:26.463 --> 02:24:27.923
Come on, no way!

02:24:27.923 --> 02:24:29.363
And they couldn't have done it without

02:24:29.363 --> 02:24:31.793
the Twitch subscriptions that I gave them.

02:24:31.793 --> 02:24:33.036
Right, guys? Yeah!

02:24:33.036 --> 02:24:34.598
Okay Sam, but what about-

02:24:34.598 --> 02:24:37.853
Oh, what about, what about what inspires me, you mean?

02:24:37.853 --> 02:24:39.913
Well, Yee-Haw Game Ranch really does.

02:24:39.913 --> 02:24:43.263
I mean, watching that dehydrated piece of string cheese

02:24:43.263 --> 02:24:45.443
Brian Foster every couple of weeks

02:24:45.443 --> 02:24:47.773
really gets me pumped for the big game!

02:24:47.773 --> 02:24:49.548
Sam, hold on, we have to-

02:24:49.548 --> 02:24:51.453
You can't believe it?

02:24:51.453 --> 02:24:52.883
You can't believe it, is that what you said?

02:24:52.883 --> 02:24:55.773
Well it's true, because every Yee-Haw VOD

02:24:55.773 --> 02:24:58.753
is instantly available as soon as you subscribe!

02:24:58.753 --> 02:24:59.586
It's amazing.

02:24:59.586 --> 02:25:00.783
Sam!
You did it, guys.

02:25:00.783 --> 02:25:02.337
Sam!
Yeah.

02:25:02.337 --> 02:25:03.170
Sam!

02:25:03.170 --> 02:25:04.003
Yeah! What, sorry.

02:25:04.003 --> 02:25:06.253
Just say "I'm going to Disneyland."

02:25:06.253 --> 02:25:08.343
You're doing a commercial for Disneyland.

02:25:08.343 --> 02:25:09.316
Oh. Uh...

02:25:13.093 --> 02:25:14.196
What's a Disneyland?

02:25:16.428 --> 02:25:19.261 line:20%
(whistle blowing)

02:25:21.013 --> 02:25:22.898
I don't know, I gotta be honest with you.

02:25:22.898 --> 02:25:23.803
Oooh!

02:25:23.803 --> 02:25:26.473
I got hit in the head pretty hard out there.

02:25:26.473 --> 02:25:27.773
Oh my God.

02:25:29.093 --> 02:25:30.910
I'm not good at sports.

02:25:30.910 --> 02:25:33.729
(crowd groaning)

02:25:33.729 --> 02:25:36.479
(crowd cheering)

02:39:30.734 --> 02:39:32.255
MATT: And welcome back.

02:39:32.255 --> 02:39:36.195
So, as you all stand at the edge of Rumblecusp,

02:39:36.195 --> 02:39:40.445
looking at these white pearlescent chains

02:39:40.445 --> 02:39:44.655
that wrap around both the body and the mouth of the Traveler

02:39:44.655 --> 02:39:47.175
in his true form revealed, dragging him up

02:39:47.175 --> 02:39:52.166
towards this celestial being that is descended from a

02:39:53.075 --> 02:39:56.791
nonsensically apparated moon in the sky,

02:39:56.791 --> 02:40:00.435
calling him for his lies amongst the populous

02:40:00.435 --> 02:40:01.991
of followers there.

02:40:03.035 --> 02:40:04.355
What do you wish to do?

02:40:04.355 --> 02:40:05.525
LAURA: Can I grab onto his feet?

02:40:05.525 --> 02:40:07.575
Is he being pulled away?
MATT: Yeah!

02:40:07.575 --> 02:40:08.905
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to hold onto his feet.

02:40:08.905 --> 02:40:09.738
MATT: Okay.

02:40:09.738 --> 02:40:11.404
You feel your feet lift off--

02:40:11.404 --> 02:40:12.896
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Jester!
Matt: -- and you are now dangling.

02:40:12.896 --> 02:40:14.025
TALIESIN: No.
ASHLEY: No!

02:40:14.025 --> 02:40:17.915
LIAM: I will throw Cat's Ire out
and grab ahold of Jester's legs

02:40:17.915 --> 02:40:19.775
with the cat's hand.

02:40:19.775 --> 02:40:22.615
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make an arcana check for me.

02:40:25.595 --> 02:40:26.605
Actually, sorry, this is not arcana.

02:40:26.605 --> 02:40:29.836
This would be a d20 plus your intelligence modifier.

02:40:31.615 --> 02:40:33.015
LIAM: 27.

02:40:33.015 --> 02:40:34.123
MATT: 27!

02:40:36.465 --> 02:40:41.165
Jester, are you going to let go?

02:40:41.165 --> 02:40:43.208
LIAM: Sorry, intelligence modifier?

02:40:43.208 --> 02:40:44.568
MATT: Yes.
LIAM: I got that wrong.

02:40:45.775 --> 02:40:47.365
23.

02:40:47.365 --> 02:40:48.780
MATT: 23, okay.

02:40:50.305 --> 02:40:52.765
As you're clutching onto the legs of the Traveler,

02:40:52.765 --> 02:40:56.435
lifting up off the ground, you feel your body

02:40:56.435 --> 02:41:00.005
now clutched by, and you don't even know

02:41:00.005 --> 02:41:02.235
what it is at the moment, but something is holding you back,

02:41:02.235 --> 02:41:03.925
and it's holding you intently.

02:41:03.925 --> 02:41:05.158
Do you continue to hold onto the Traveler--

02:41:05.158 --> 02:41:07.125
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: -- or do you let go? Okay.

02:41:07.125 --> 02:41:09.528
The chains become taut.

02:41:10.775 --> 02:41:14.075
MARISHA: Am I still nearby? From where I tackled blondie?

02:41:14.075 --> 02:41:14.945
MATT: I mean, you're nearby.

02:41:14.945 --> 02:41:17.575
Jester's about 10 feet up in the air, yeah.

02:41:17.575 --> 02:41:19.510
MARISHA: Can I move over to Jester?

02:41:20.545 --> 02:41:22.625
MATT: You can move under her and leap up to climb her.

02:41:22.625 --> 02:41:24.975
But she's currently grappled by the cat's claw.
MARISHA: Just move under her.

02:41:24.975 --> 02:41:26.185
MATT: Okay, move under her.

02:41:26.185 --> 02:41:27.785
TALIESIN: I'm also going to cast True Seeing.

02:41:28.765 --> 02:41:29.598
MATT: Okay.

02:41:31.325 --> 02:41:35.358
The celestial being, hand out, goes,

02:41:36.585 --> 02:41:41.585
"Do not grab on. Leave this creature to its fate."

02:41:41.846 --> 02:41:43.115
LAURA: Please, no!

02:41:43.115 --> 02:41:45.345
MATT: You watch it as it flicks a hand,

02:41:45.345 --> 02:41:47.172
and what level is your...

02:41:48.346 --> 02:41:50.004
LIAM: What level is the spell?
MATT: Yes.

02:41:50.004 --> 02:41:52.275
LIAM: It is--
MATT: Is it 3rd-level?

02:41:52.275 --> 02:41:53.225
LIAM: -- fifth.

02:41:53.225 --> 02:41:54.692
MATT: 5th-level?
LIAM: Yeah.

02:41:55.565 --> 02:41:56.948
MATT: Okay, yeah, no problem.

02:41:56.948 --> 02:42:01.285
The cat's hand is dispelled and vanishes,

02:42:01.285 --> 02:42:04.035
and the chains begin to continue to pull him up away.

02:42:04.035 --> 02:42:08.005
Jester's now 15, 20 feet up as the creature is just,

02:42:08.005 --> 02:42:12.135
pupilless, these shimmering, white glowing eyes

02:42:12.135 --> 02:42:15.278
against the blue skin, the

02:42:15.278 --> 02:42:18.365
puffed long white-silver mohawk, the wings (whooshes).

02:42:18.365 --> 02:42:21.915
LAURA: I'm just shouting up to the creature like:

02:42:21.915 --> 02:42:24.156
Please just-- you know, you don't have to take him.

02:42:24.156 --> 02:42:26.308
Just let him go. He's real nice.

02:42:26.308 --> 02:42:28.885
He's really sorry for for what he did.

02:42:28.885 --> 02:42:33.885
But we think that the Moon Weaver's super great and stuff.

02:42:33.915 --> 02:42:37.055
MATT: As still being dragged up, the crowd is just silent

02:42:37.055 --> 02:42:39.405
and still as you all are looking up.

02:42:39.405 --> 02:42:43.245
You're casting True Seeing. You do see this entity.

02:42:43.245 --> 02:42:45.675
Its form does not change with the True Seeing,

02:42:45.675 --> 02:42:50.675
but there is a magnificent glow around them.

02:42:50.725 --> 02:42:54.815
There is-- this entity has been entrusted

02:42:54.815 --> 02:42:57.183
with quite a bit of divine power.

02:42:57.183 --> 02:42:59.665
That is, when the True Seeing goes off,

02:42:59.665 --> 02:43:02.275
you have to squint almost. It's very bright.

02:43:02.275 --> 02:43:04.475
TALIESIN: Nothing weird with the Traveler right now?

02:43:04.475 --> 02:43:05.784
MATT: Nothing weird with the Traveler.
TALIESIN: All right.

02:43:05.784 --> 02:43:09.795
MATT: Beyond just being diminished, ever so slightly.

02:43:09.795 --> 02:43:11.653
TALIESIN: We are in over our heads.

02:43:14.035 --> 02:43:18.195
ASHLEY: I'm going to move to stand
under Jester, just in case.

02:43:18.195 --> 02:43:19.915
MATT: Okay.

02:43:19.915 --> 02:43:22.545
Jester is now about 30 or so feet off the ground,

02:43:22.545 --> 02:43:25.785
as the chains slowly begin to tow

02:43:25.785 --> 02:43:29.355
both the Traveler and her up towards this moon,

02:43:29.355 --> 02:43:32.145
and the creature just stays there, still flapping the wings,

02:43:32.145 --> 02:43:34.065
not even paying attention to the rest of the crowd below

02:43:34.065 --> 02:43:35.115
in hushed silence.

02:43:35.115 --> 02:43:38.085
TRAVIS: I'm going to cast Hex on Jester,

02:43:38.085 --> 02:43:40.749
and I'm going to use my bonus action to

02:43:40.749 --> 02:43:45.412
use Relentless Hex and teleport 30 feet to where she is.

02:43:46.335 --> 02:43:47.168
MATT: Okay.

02:43:48.085 --> 02:43:49.375
All right.

02:43:49.375 --> 02:43:53.165
So casting it, the shadows around--

02:43:53.165 --> 02:43:54.305
where the moonlight is hitting her,

02:43:54.305 --> 02:43:57.085
the dark shadows behind her body

02:43:57.085 --> 02:43:59.885
wrap around and create this strange harness

02:43:59.885 --> 02:44:02.095
of dark shadow energy that swirls

02:44:02.095 --> 02:44:04.265
and wraps around her torso.

02:44:04.265 --> 02:44:06.335
As it's cascading and almost licking

02:44:06.335 --> 02:44:07.655
the back of the Traveler's legs,

02:44:07.655 --> 02:44:10.465
like surf against the edge of a shoreline.

02:44:10.465 --> 02:44:15.285
As you rush up, she's about 35 or so feet off the ground.

02:44:15.285 --> 02:44:18.945
So you run and you leap where

02:44:18.945 --> 02:44:20.465
if this doesn't work, you might be heading

02:44:20.465 --> 02:44:22.975
towards the lava below, and then (whooshes)

02:44:22.975 --> 02:44:24.345
and appear right up towards her.

02:44:24.345 --> 02:44:26.395
TRAVIS: I just grab onto the back of her shoulders.

02:44:26.395 --> 02:44:28.615
I know I'm not strong enough to pull you off.

02:44:28.615 --> 02:44:29.822
You have to let him go.

02:44:29.822 --> 02:44:31.395
LAURA: No! No, no, no, no, no.

02:44:31.395 --> 02:44:33.125
TRAVIS: Jester, we knew this might happen.

02:44:33.125 --> 02:44:34.935
He's played in things that are larger than him.

02:44:34.935 --> 02:44:36.905
You cannot go with him.

02:44:36.905 --> 02:44:38.335
LAURA: But he's my best friend!

02:44:38.335 --> 02:44:40.545
TRAVIS: I know, but we are here for all of you.

02:44:40.545 --> 02:44:43.965
You need to let go.

02:44:43.965 --> 02:44:45.620
We will catch you.

02:44:46.505 --> 02:44:48.115
LAURA: Oh no.

02:44:48.115 --> 02:44:49.285
Artie?

02:44:49.285 --> 02:44:52.493
MATT: You look up and his eyes
are wide and "(muffled yelling)".

02:44:52.493 --> 02:44:54.507
LAURA: I know, I'm going to get you.

02:44:54.507 --> 02:44:56.147
I'm going to get you free, okay?

02:44:56.147 --> 02:45:00.312
MATT: (muffled, panicked speech)

02:45:00.312 --> 02:45:01.485
The creature's still

02:45:01.485 --> 02:45:05.705
looking forward, as he just begins to slowly

02:45:05.705 --> 02:45:10.445
pull up closer and closer. It reads no emotion on its face,

02:45:10.445 --> 02:45:12.166
just presence.

02:45:12.166 --> 02:45:14.365
LAURA: How do we make it right?

02:45:14.365 --> 02:45:15.405
How do we fix it?

02:45:15.405 --> 02:45:17.205
How do we make her let him go?

02:45:18.055 --> 02:45:20.295
MATT: You shout this towards the--
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:45:20.295 --> 02:45:21.987
MATT: The head turns towards you.

02:45:23.535 --> 02:45:25.808
"Why do you cry for this one?"

02:45:25.808 --> 02:45:27.917
LAURA: 'Cause he's my friend.

02:45:29.115 --> 02:45:30.823
MATT: "This is a selfish creature."

02:45:32.155 --> 02:45:34.473
LAURA: He's been very, very giving.

02:45:36.182 --> 02:45:38.310
And he really likes his freedom.

02:45:44.657 --> 02:45:46.295
MATT: "Freedom, you say."

02:45:47.994 --> 02:45:51.098
And the creature looks down upon all these entities.

02:45:53.395 --> 02:45:56.281
"The freedom to manipulate.

02:45:57.195 --> 02:46:02.195
"The freedom to guide, to twist and shape

02:46:02.265 --> 02:46:05.421
"the perspectives of those who do not know better.

02:46:07.595 --> 02:46:10.645
"To take the form

02:46:10.645 --> 02:46:14.345
"of <i>my</i> god,

02:46:14.345 --> 02:46:16.671
"and speak falsely of her name."

02:46:19.935 --> 02:46:21.535
LAURA: (tearfully) When you say it like that.

02:46:23.143 --> 02:46:25.584
MATT: "Why do you cry for this selfish creature?"

02:46:28.045 --> 02:46:29.545
LAURA: 'Cause I love him.

02:46:40.275 --> 02:46:41.475
(crying) I do.

02:46:47.275 --> 02:46:49.855
MATT: See the brow furrows in disdain as it looks

02:46:49.855 --> 02:46:51.895
over towards Artagan.

02:46:52.735 --> 02:46:54.627
Who's still just (muffled speech).

02:46:55.895 --> 02:46:57.153
Like nudging.

02:47:03.165 --> 02:47:05.015
(as celestial being) "And what is this?"

02:47:09.722 --> 02:47:10.989
LAURA: A mistake.

02:47:15.245 --> 02:47:17.823
MATT: "There are very few times in history

02:47:19.615 --> 02:47:24.545
"that those of pious gift carry themselves to the edge

02:47:25.855 --> 02:47:27.326
"of a fiery death.

02:47:33.035 --> 02:47:36.788
"You tell me this was not the intent of this creature."

02:47:47.645 --> 02:47:49.728
LAURA: He just wanted to have some fun.

02:47:51.105 --> 02:47:52.605
It got out of hand.

02:48:00.315 --> 02:48:01.765
MATT: "And who are you?"

02:48:03.675 --> 02:48:04.783
LAURA: Jester.

02:48:10.375 --> 02:48:11.533
That's all.

02:48:17.125 --> 02:48:21.343
MATT: "Are you willing to carry this penance as well?

02:48:22.685 --> 02:48:27.228
"For to hold onto these chains is to accept them.

02:48:28.855 --> 02:48:30.763
"Do you love him this much?"

02:48:35.435 --> 02:48:37.078
LAURA: I look at Artagan.

02:48:42.409 --> 02:48:43.925
MATT: (as Artagan) "(muffled grunt)"

02:48:47.875 --> 02:48:49.520
LAURA: I look back at Fjord.

02:48:56.305 --> 02:48:59.408
MATT: Artagan closes his eyes,

02:49:01.255 --> 02:49:03.480
takes a deep breath through the nose.

02:49:07.935 --> 02:49:09.777
Make a strength check for me.

02:49:21.360 --> 02:49:22.651
LAURA: 14.

02:49:26.975 --> 02:49:30.578
MATT: Not pain, but force strikes you in the chest,

02:49:32.775 --> 02:49:37.706
as Artagan has kicked both you and Fjord off of him.

02:49:42.035 --> 02:49:45.095
As you fall back, losing your grip on him,

02:49:45.095 --> 02:49:48.145
you see in his eyes a resignation,

02:49:48.145 --> 02:49:50.661
but a smile under the chains.

02:49:56.485 --> 02:49:57.375
You're both falling.

02:49:57.375 --> 02:49:59.005
LIAM: I cast the Feather Fall on both of them.

02:49:59.005 --> 02:50:01.835
They hadn't made it beyond 30, 40, 50, 60 feet?

02:50:01.835 --> 02:50:03.855
MATT: At this point, they're about 60 feet up, so--

02:50:03.855 --> 02:50:06.095
LIAM: Okay, so as soon as they are right at the cusp,

02:50:06.095 --> 02:50:07.451
I'll cast it on the two of them.

02:50:07.451 --> 02:50:08.526
MATT: Okay.

02:50:09.588 --> 02:50:11.715
You begin to glide back down

02:50:11.715 --> 02:50:15.025
SAM: Towards the lava, or towards the--

02:50:15.025 --> 02:50:16.495
MATT: It's precarious.

02:50:16.495 --> 02:50:17.961
LIAM: Just do this.

02:50:17.961 --> 02:50:18.935
LAURA: (laughs)

02:50:18.935 --> 02:50:20.905
MARISHA: I grab Yasha's hand.

02:50:21.965 --> 02:50:24.640
Basket catch?
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:50:24.640 --> 02:50:27.545
MARISHA: We just make a little basket, cheerleading style.

02:50:33.191 --> 02:50:35.665
MATT: As you guys are brought down,
you can see now the chains

02:50:35.665 --> 02:50:39.095
as they begin to pull him up towards the moonlight.

02:50:44.415 --> 02:50:46.325
The silhouette against the moon,

02:50:46.325 --> 02:50:48.818
showing that wild mane of hair.

02:50:50.395 --> 02:50:54.165
The shadow now where the face looks towards you,

02:50:54.165 --> 02:50:58.185
shoulders slumped, as the vibrant radiant chains

02:50:58.185 --> 02:51:03.020
that wrap around him give off their own intense glow.

02:51:04.995 --> 02:51:06.815
His legs and feet just dangling

02:51:06.815 --> 02:51:09.936
as the cloak itself flows with the breeze.

02:51:14.925 --> 02:51:16.692
And you swear you see a tear.

02:51:26.830 --> 02:51:29.330
And the chains come to a halt.

02:51:35.575 --> 02:51:39.653
And the celestial creature looks over towards Artagan,

02:51:43.985 --> 02:51:48.458
and flies over, looming over his form.

02:51:55.445 --> 02:51:57.437
"Have you learned your lesson?"

02:52:00.375 --> 02:52:04.708
The voice now deeper and richer,

02:52:04.708 --> 02:52:06.691
though still feminine,

02:52:06.691 --> 02:52:11.145
but even for a creature this awe-striking,

02:52:11.145 --> 02:52:12.655
it is not their own.

02:52:12.655 --> 02:52:15.726
They are but a mouthpiece for this new voice.

02:52:18.015 --> 02:52:20.507
Artagan looks up for a second.

02:52:22.665 --> 02:52:23.956
(as the Moon Weaver) "Good.

02:52:26.815 --> 02:52:30.685
"Be careful with whose realms you prod and poke.

02:52:32.955 --> 02:52:36.231
"You're not beyond reproach, Archfey."

02:52:37.725 --> 02:52:40.883
And the chains release

02:52:42.125 --> 02:52:44.583
and draw back up towards the moon.

02:52:44.583 --> 02:52:48.561
Artagan just goes into a free fall.

02:52:50.055 --> 02:52:53.080
SAM: I will cast Feather Fall on Artagan.

02:53:00.195 --> 02:53:04.195
MATT: As Artagan-- for the first time

02:53:04.195 --> 02:53:08.995
you've ever seen him truly shaken and speechless

02:53:08.995 --> 02:53:10.735
for the experiences that you've had

02:53:10.735 --> 02:53:13.535
and for the lifetime that you've spent

02:53:14.555 --> 02:53:19.105
off and on with his presence, just dumbfounded and silent

02:53:19.105 --> 02:53:23.055
as he glides back down to the edge of Rumblecusp.

02:53:23.055 --> 02:53:26.227
As the celestial entity flies over the group of

02:53:27.331 --> 02:53:31.848
nearly 200 followers, that voice comes through once more.

02:53:34.455 --> 02:53:39.455
(as the Moon Weaver) "There are many
who seek to bend your trust.

02:53:41.365 --> 02:53:45.496
"Some for good, some for gain,

02:53:46.935 --> 02:53:50.628
"and some just because they can.

02:53:53.985 --> 02:53:56.288
"Be careful who you put your faith in,

02:53:57.185 --> 02:54:00.241
"for not all have your best interests at heart.

02:54:02.875 --> 02:54:05.766
"But if you do indeed seek guidance,

02:54:07.940 --> 02:54:12.940
"then know that through the shadow and light of the night,

02:54:13.535 --> 02:54:17.995
"there is one that can watch and keep you.

02:54:22.155 --> 02:54:27.048
"I carry no lies for those that show me love."

02:54:32.312 --> 02:54:36.145
And begins to fly up back towards the moon.

02:54:37.285 --> 02:54:40.555
As you see the silhouette of this flying celestial creature

02:54:40.555 --> 02:54:45.505
begin to just faintly blur against the very intense,

02:54:45.505 --> 02:54:50.138
bright white light of Catha, the moon fades,

02:54:51.955 --> 02:54:55.385
and is gone, and there in that break in the clouds

02:54:55.385 --> 02:54:59.645
you just see the twinkling of stars against the night sky.

02:55:04.875 --> 02:55:08.285
Artagan, his feet touch the edge of the volcano

02:55:08.285 --> 02:55:09.902
and the crowd is hushed.

02:55:11.555 --> 02:55:14.080
He looks over towards the crowd.

02:55:15.047 --> 02:55:16.647
He looks towards you.

02:55:23.535 --> 02:55:26.868
"And that is why you worship the Moon Weaver.

02:55:26.868 --> 02:55:30.642
"Because, if I'm going to be frank,

02:55:32.034 --> 02:55:33.650
"I can't do that.

02:55:33.650 --> 02:55:34.875
"(chuckles nervously)

02:55:34.875 --> 02:55:36.375
"Good night, everybody."

02:55:36.375 --> 02:55:38.573
And he just walks away.

02:55:41.695 --> 02:55:44.270
Everybody's just like, looking up.

02:55:46.585 --> 02:55:49.622
LAURA: (claps)
(scattered clapping)

02:55:49.622 --> 02:55:51.055
MARISHA: Woo!

02:55:51.055 --> 02:55:52.785
LAURA: What a show.

02:55:52.785 --> 02:55:55.155
That was really a good show.

02:55:55.155 --> 02:55:58.503
MARISHA: Traveler Con is dope!

02:56:01.237 --> 02:56:02.935
MATT: There's some murmuring through the crowd now

02:56:02.935 --> 02:56:06.685
and some people just look a bit shellshocked.

02:56:06.685 --> 02:56:09.405
Some people look a bit ticked off.

02:56:09.405 --> 02:56:12.395
Some people are like, well, back to drinking.

02:56:12.395 --> 02:56:14.315
And slowly the crowd begins to

02:56:14.315 --> 02:56:16.945
make its way back down the path of the mountain.

02:56:16.945 --> 02:56:19.838
Some subtle arguments break out in the crowd.

02:56:20.715 --> 02:56:21.965
Some people get unruly,

02:56:21.965 --> 02:56:24.165
but then others kind of tamp it down.

02:56:24.165 --> 02:56:27.983
It's an odd mixture of energy.

02:56:31.295 --> 02:56:32.970
Not what you expected.

02:56:40.225 --> 02:56:41.875
LAURA: I give Fjord a hug.

02:56:44.745 --> 02:56:47.120
TRAVIS: You shouldn't have to pay for his mistakes.

02:56:53.950 --> 02:56:57.109
Do you want to talk to him?

02:57:01.189 --> 02:57:03.969
LAURA: I think he wants to be alone right now.

02:57:06.380 --> 02:57:08.905
TRAVIS: I think Jester could use a hug.

02:57:08.905 --> 02:57:11.422
Put my arm around her, pull her in.

02:57:12.712 --> 02:57:14.262
MARISHA: I just move in.

02:57:14.262 --> 02:57:16.065
TRAVIS: Big hug.

02:57:16.065 --> 02:57:17.105
MARISHA: Group hug.

02:57:17.105 --> 02:57:18.355
TALIESIN: I'll go last, I got a lot of arm.

02:57:18.355 --> 02:57:23.066
MARISHA: I grab Caleb from in the
back of the group, drag him in.

02:57:23.945 --> 02:57:27.303
MATT: You watch as a

02:57:27.303 --> 02:57:30.925
portly dwarf in simple clothing

02:57:30.925 --> 02:57:35.358
goes, "Well, I suppose if we're all getting in on that."

02:57:35.358 --> 02:57:37.262
TALIESIN: Yeah, bring him in. Bring him in.

02:57:37.262 --> 02:57:38.892
LAURA: He's so great, I love him.

02:57:38.892 --> 02:57:41.705
MATT: Kellbast takes the 15-foot walk

02:57:41.705 --> 02:57:42.975
as he was one of the stragglers

02:57:42.975 --> 02:57:45.091
and comes in on the hug for a minute, too.

02:57:45.091 --> 02:57:45.924
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:57:47.385 --> 02:57:49.235
MATT: And eventually backs off, goes--

02:57:50.515 --> 02:57:54.555
And joins the rest of the final moseyers that are

02:57:54.555 --> 02:57:56.558
making their way back towards the village.

02:57:58.105 --> 02:58:00.755
TRAVIS: As they're making their way down,

02:58:00.755 --> 02:58:04.565
are there any disgruntled that are remaining?

02:58:04.565 --> 02:58:06.428
MATT: Remaining? Remaining, no.

02:58:06.428 --> 02:58:09.555
The ones that were visibly disgruntled

02:58:09.555 --> 02:58:12.305
were the first to leave, or at least

02:58:12.305 --> 02:58:16.811
were quick to follow the energy off the side of the volcano.

02:58:18.775 --> 02:58:22.655
TRAVIS: Maybe we just let them
find their way down for a moment.

02:58:22.655 --> 02:58:24.595
SAM: Yeah, maybe we should just keep some distance

02:58:24.595 --> 02:58:28.193
in case they want to take it out on us or something?

02:58:28.193 --> 02:58:30.395
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, give them some time.

02:58:30.395 --> 02:58:32.535
LIAM: They still have the crescent dicks to light their way

02:58:32.535 --> 02:58:34.335
to the bottom.

02:58:34.335 --> 02:58:36.975
Caleb waves his hands and all the other illusions

02:58:36.975 --> 02:58:39.775
around the island snuff out, except for the dick lights

02:58:39.775 --> 02:58:40.675
down the mountain.

02:58:41.965 --> 02:58:44.418
TALIESIN: I've also got this going on for the next hour.

02:58:44.418 --> 02:58:45.705
SAM: What's that? What's that?

02:58:45.705 --> 02:58:48.645
TALIESIN: Oh, I just wanted to
make sure that was really happening,

02:58:48.645 --> 02:58:52.065
so I can see everything for the next hour.

02:58:52.065 --> 02:58:54.225
My eyes are just chromed over.

02:58:54.225 --> 02:58:55.235
SAM: You can see everything?

02:58:55.235 --> 02:58:56.925
TALIESIN: I can basically see everything right now.

02:58:56.925 --> 02:58:57.836
It's a lot.

02:58:57.836 --> 02:58:58.945
SAM: Whoa.
TALIESIN: You know.

02:58:58.945 --> 02:59:02.145
MARISHA: Yeah, I've been there before. Yeah.

02:59:02.145 --> 02:59:04.939
Do you see the little floating fish thing that just--

02:59:04.939 --> 02:59:09.157
the fish that are just always there?

02:59:09.157 --> 02:59:10.405
MATT: Right now, at the top of this mountain,

02:59:10.405 --> 02:59:12.702
not in the immediate vicinity.

02:59:12.702 --> 02:59:14.045
TALIESIN: Pretty chill.

02:59:14.045 --> 02:59:17.420
MARISHA: Whoa, I thought they were everywhere. Huh.

02:59:19.665 --> 02:59:23.006
SAM: In case we get back to camp and everyone,

02:59:23.006 --> 02:59:25.747
or some want to, you know, kill us.

02:59:27.175 --> 02:59:30.528
Should we check in with our boat,

02:59:30.528 --> 02:59:34.953
our crew, to get off this island?

02:59:34.953 --> 02:59:36.795
LAURA: Probably.

02:59:36.795 --> 02:59:38.355
LIAM: Maybe we don't want to--

02:59:40.005 --> 02:59:41.975
Maybe we want to sleep apart from the village tonight

02:59:41.975 --> 02:59:44.795
and let them sort of stew in their juices

02:59:44.795 --> 02:59:46.552
and suss things out in the morning.

02:59:46.552 --> 02:59:48.295
TRAVIS: Might be wise.
LAURA: Yeah.

02:59:48.295 --> 02:59:50.475
I still think the bulk of them don't actually

02:59:50.475 --> 02:59:53.732
have a way to get home, unfortunately.

02:59:53.732 --> 02:59:55.265
SAM: Oof.

02:59:55.265 --> 02:59:59.625
MARISHA: Man, feels like this
keeps happening on this island.

02:59:59.625 --> 03:00:00.605
LAURA: Yeah.

03:00:00.605 --> 03:00:04.972
Maybe we can, you know,

03:00:04.972 --> 03:00:06.525
tell them we're leaving in the morning.

03:00:06.525 --> 03:00:09.265
People can get on the boat or whatever, if they want.

03:00:09.265 --> 03:00:10.885
We could take the big ship.

03:00:10.885 --> 03:00:13.655
LIAM: If we can get it out of there.
We have to figure that out.

03:00:13.655 --> 03:00:15.325
LAURA: Oh, jeez.

03:00:15.325 --> 03:00:17.635
TRAVIS: If we do, then perhaps you can send a message

03:00:17.635 --> 03:00:19.985
to someone in the village and let them know

03:00:19.985 --> 03:00:22.175
where the ships are and perhaps the best way

03:00:22.175 --> 03:00:25.415
to get the boats-- the ships out after we figure it out.

03:00:25.415 --> 03:00:26.805
MATT: Caduceus, Beauregard, and Caleb,

03:00:26.805 --> 03:00:28.595
you do notice this high up...

03:00:31.585 --> 03:00:33.648
Just because you have super high perception.

03:00:34.585 --> 03:00:38.275
There are, down towards the entryway beach,

03:00:38.275 --> 03:00:39.885
the only reason you can see from this distance,

03:00:39.885 --> 03:00:42.765
especially without it being a moonlit night,

03:00:42.765 --> 03:00:44.885
you can see a handful of small lights,

03:00:44.885 --> 03:00:47.665
but there are a number of ships that are anchored

03:00:48.585 --> 03:00:49.475
off the island.

03:00:49.475 --> 03:00:51.685
Everyone wasn't just dropped off to never return.

03:00:51.685 --> 03:00:55.015
There are a number of ships that have been

03:00:55.015 --> 03:00:57.905
in waiting for the duration of the few days

03:00:57.905 --> 03:00:59.855
the event was going to take place.

03:00:59.855 --> 03:01:04.222
So there are some ways that at least

03:01:04.222 --> 03:01:06.405
some of these folks are going to get their way home.

03:01:07.435 --> 03:01:10.002
It is not entirely your responsibility.

03:01:14.685 --> 03:01:18.770
LAURA: So that was a little embarrassing, you guys.

03:01:18.770 --> 03:01:21.520
(laughs)

03:01:25.945 --> 03:01:28.785
TALIESIN: I mean, in the end, I suppose it worked out

03:01:28.785 --> 03:01:30.360
as well as it could've.

03:01:31.925 --> 03:01:33.507
LAURA: Yeah.

03:01:33.507 --> 03:01:38.500
Guess I didn't think about how powerful actual gods are.

03:01:41.465 --> 03:01:44.455
LIAM: I think it went about as bizarrely

03:01:44.455 --> 03:01:48.075
as we have come to expect from you and your friend.

03:01:48.075 --> 03:01:48.908
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:01:51.255 --> 03:01:54.575
MARISHA: It really, truly didn't disappoint.

03:01:54.575 --> 03:01:59.575
I know maybe it's too close to laugh at it, but...

03:02:02.165 --> 03:02:05.745
It was kind of spectacular, in a roundabout way.

03:02:05.745 --> 03:02:08.595
LIAM: Yeah, no one on this island, us included,

03:02:08.595 --> 03:02:12.981
will ever forget the events of the last several days.

03:02:12.981 --> 03:02:14.885
LAURA: That's true.
TALIESIN: Hmm.

03:02:14.885 --> 03:02:16.881
LAURA: That was pretty miraculous.

03:02:16.881 --> 03:02:18.131
TRAVIS: He got what he wanted.

03:02:18.131 --> 03:02:20.345
LIAM: Yeah, you threw a hell of a party.

03:02:21.700 --> 03:02:23.404
MARISHA: It was a great party.

03:02:23.404 --> 03:02:24.823
LAURA: It was a great party.

03:02:24.823 --> 03:02:26.425
TALIESIN: I think it's still going on down there.

03:02:26.425 --> 03:02:27.418
LAURA: Yeah.

03:02:27.418 --> 03:02:28.251
And...

03:02:30.055 --> 03:02:31.330
He's free.

03:02:33.255 --> 03:02:34.088
And...

03:02:40.695 --> 03:02:42.048
You guys are everything.

03:02:44.145 --> 03:02:45.503
Thank you.

03:02:47.610 --> 03:02:49.360
You did so much.

03:02:51.685 --> 03:02:52.518
Like...

03:02:56.635 --> 03:03:00.015
I wouldn't have been able to do any of it without you.

03:03:00.015 --> 03:03:01.508
It's just amazing.

03:03:02.885 --> 03:03:06.695
Thank you for, you know, all the illusions,

03:03:06.695 --> 03:03:10.085
all the crazy cool lights, and for the gun,

03:03:10.085 --> 03:03:13.404
and for the music,

03:03:13.404 --> 03:03:14.978
and the Guidance,

03:03:14.978 --> 03:03:16.553
and the drinks.

03:03:17.415 --> 03:03:22.400
And thank you for, you know, coming after me.

03:03:24.615 --> 03:03:28.985
If you hadn't been there, I probably would have just...

03:03:31.125 --> 03:03:32.441
I don't know.

03:03:34.815 --> 03:03:37.645
I'm glad you were hanging onto me.

03:03:37.645 --> 03:03:40.916
TRAVIS: I don't think we would let you go so easy.

03:03:43.025 --> 03:03:43.858
LAURA: Yeah.

03:03:47.695 --> 03:03:50.058
MARISHA: Hey, don't feel bad about this.

03:03:53.945 --> 03:03:57.938
I recognize this,

03:03:57.938 --> 03:04:00.735
and that's face of someone

03:04:00.735 --> 03:04:03.588
who feels like they were an incredible burden,

03:04:04.755 --> 03:04:09.115
but it was never that.

03:04:09.115 --> 03:04:10.596
I hope you know that.

03:04:13.235 --> 03:04:16.975
LIAM: Everything we contributed is nothing less

03:04:16.975 --> 03:04:18.198
than what you deserve.

03:04:20.162 --> 03:04:24.098
You have given us that much 10 times over

03:04:24.098 --> 03:04:25.610
in our time together.

03:04:33.756 --> 03:04:37.235
LAURA: I always say the Traveler is my best friend.

03:04:37.235 --> 03:04:42.235
And, you know, I mean, he is, he's my oldest friend.

03:04:44.255 --> 03:04:45.238
But you guys.

03:04:49.965 --> 03:04:51.998
I'm really glad I found you all.

03:04:57.365 --> 03:05:02.365
SAM: We're glad that you didn't
go away to heaven or whatever.

03:05:02.613 --> 03:05:04.575
LAURA: I don't know where I would have gone, I mean--

03:05:04.575 --> 03:05:05.978
TRAVIS: Where were you going to go?

03:05:05.978 --> 03:05:07.885
LAURA: I don't know where they were taking us.

03:05:07.885 --> 03:05:09.825
That could have been a crazy adventure.

03:05:09.825 --> 03:05:11.495
MARISHA: There's got to be a prison on the moon, right?

03:05:11.495 --> 03:05:14.125
TALIESIN: That's dark.
LAURA: Moon prison?

03:05:14.125 --> 03:05:15.655
Oh man.

03:05:15.655 --> 03:05:17.005
MARISHA: I mean, that would have been

03:05:17.005 --> 03:05:18.865
an epic jailbreak that we would have gotten.

03:05:18.865 --> 03:05:23.055
We could've gone to the moon to save Jester, you guys.

03:05:23.055 --> 03:05:26.245
Second time we would have busted your ass out of jail.

03:05:26.245 --> 03:05:27.695
LIAM: Did the angelic being say that it was

03:05:27.695 --> 03:05:30.675
going to bring him back to his folk?

03:05:30.675 --> 03:05:31.705
I thought I remembered that--
MATT: Yes.

03:05:31.705 --> 03:05:33.405
LIAM: Being thrown out.

03:05:33.405 --> 03:05:38.252
He was being taken back to the
other Oberons and Titanias of the Feywild.

03:05:39.455 --> 03:05:40.605
MATT: The worst punishment.

03:05:43.425 --> 03:05:45.475
To return him to his previous punishment.

03:05:46.695 --> 03:05:49.455
SAM: You know, he's given you a lot over the years, Jester,

03:05:49.455 --> 03:05:53.088
but you just saved his existence, pretty much.

03:05:53.995 --> 03:05:54.915
So...

03:05:56.785 --> 03:06:00.465
I mean, not like you need it or anything,

03:06:00.465 --> 03:06:02.968
but you're even stevens now.
LIAM: Yeah.

03:06:04.215 --> 03:06:05.048
ASHLEY: It's true.

03:06:05.048 --> 03:06:07.415
LIAM: You guys have always made a good team.

03:06:08.795 --> 03:06:09.808
LAURA: Yeah.

03:06:09.808 --> 03:06:12.488
Hey, maybe he can become a
member of the Mighty Nein with us.

03:06:12.488 --> 03:06:14.382
SAM: I don't think--
MARISHA: Well, no, I don't--

03:06:14.382 --> 03:06:17.158
SAM: I don't think that we--
TRAVIS: It's a set number.

03:06:17.158 --> 03:06:19.713
SAM: Nein, so it can't be ten. It can't be ten.

03:06:19.713 --> 03:06:21.388
TRAVIS: It would be just weird.
LIAM: Adjunct. Associate.

03:06:21.388 --> 03:06:22.940
TRAVIS: The branding's important.

03:06:22.940 --> 03:06:24.795
MARISHA: Yeah, exactly.

03:06:24.795 --> 03:06:27.243
SAM: We don't like your friend.

03:06:27.243 --> 03:06:30.025
I mean, we like you.

03:06:30.025 --> 03:06:31.757
LAURA: He'll grow on you.
SAM: (doubtful) Hmm!

03:06:31.757 --> 03:06:33.805
LAURA: He's going to be around, you guys.

03:06:33.805 --> 03:06:35.565
I don't know if you've noticed,

03:06:35.565 --> 03:06:38.076
but you're kind of stuck with him now.

03:06:38.076 --> 03:06:39.745
So he's going to be around.

03:06:39.745 --> 03:06:42.775
TRAVIS: I think the scales are
slightly more in your favor now,

03:06:42.775 --> 03:06:45.445
so perhaps he can earn it, you know,

03:06:45.445 --> 03:06:47.225
buy his way back into our good graces.

03:06:47.225 --> 03:06:48.058
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

03:06:49.093 --> 03:06:51.477
TRAVIS: Whatever happens next.

03:06:51.477 --> 03:06:53.985
MARISHA: Would he let me punch him in the face?

03:06:53.985 --> 03:06:56.215
LAURA: He probably would, actually.

03:06:56.215 --> 03:06:57.896
MARISHA: Because I want to so bad.

03:06:57.896 --> 03:06:59.915
TALIESIN: He might like it.
SAM: He'll let you choke him out.

03:06:59.915 --> 03:07:01.946
MARISHA: Oh my god, that's such a great idea.

03:07:01.946 --> 03:07:03.515
LAURA: Yeah?
MARISHA: So original.

03:07:03.515 --> 03:07:04.395
LAURA: I would give it some time.

03:07:04.395 --> 03:07:08.805
I think he might be a little... shaken.

03:07:08.805 --> 03:07:12.818
SAM: Oh yeah, he seems not in a good mood.

03:07:14.055 --> 03:07:15.465
LAURA: No.

03:07:15.465 --> 03:07:17.415
SAM: I wonder if he's still on the island.

03:07:18.515 --> 03:07:20.148
But you know what? Also, I don't care.

03:07:20.148 --> 03:07:23.615
As long as you're okay, who gives a shit.

03:07:25.675 --> 03:07:28.148
You caught him as he was falling.

03:07:29.365 --> 03:07:30.198
SAM: Hmm?

03:07:30.198 --> 03:07:32.606
TRAVIS: You caught the Traveler, Artagan--

03:07:32.606 --> 03:07:34.825
SAM: With magic that Caleb taught me, yes.

03:07:34.825 --> 03:07:36.295
MARISHA: Yeah, I actually thought you were going to

03:07:36.295 --> 03:07:37.545
let his ass fall to the ground.

03:07:37.545 --> 03:07:39.635
TRAVIS: Does he normally need to be caught?

03:07:39.635 --> 03:07:41.005
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:07:41.005 --> 03:07:44.598
LAURA: He would have been able to do a multitude of things.

03:07:45.475 --> 03:07:47.624
But thank you.
TRAVIS: Are you sure?

03:07:47.624 --> 03:07:50.588
SAM: Sure, no-- I mean, I'm not sure.

03:07:50.588 --> 03:07:54.185
LAURA: I mean, I don't know, maybe the Moon Weaver

03:07:54.185 --> 03:07:57.263
like, stunted his magic for a minute.

03:07:58.786 --> 03:07:59.942
I don't know.

03:07:59.942 --> 03:08:01.125
TRAVIS: Seems odd, yeah.

03:08:01.125 --> 03:08:02.968
LAURA: It is weird that he walked away.

03:08:04.395 --> 03:08:05.895
SAM: He did <i>walk</i> away.

03:08:05.895 --> 03:08:08.335
He doesn't really walk a lot.

03:08:08.335 --> 03:08:10.135
TRAVIS: No, he doesn't.

03:08:11.565 --> 03:08:12.398
LAURA: Hmm.

03:08:14.885 --> 03:08:16.875
TRAVIS: There's a lot of dangerous shit on this island.

03:08:16.875 --> 03:08:19.705
I'm just saying, maybe if you want to send him a message

03:08:19.705 --> 03:08:22.838
and just give him a heads up, just in case he's, you know,

03:08:24.055 --> 03:08:26.395
tapped out for a moment.

03:08:26.395 --> 03:08:28.235
MARISHA: But what about you? You're still good.

03:08:28.235 --> 03:08:30.898
You still got a little of that magic juicy juice?

03:08:31.795 --> 03:08:33.545
LAURA: I always got a little something up my sleeve.

03:08:33.545 --> 03:08:34.670
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:08:36.495 --> 03:08:38.141
<i>Are</i> you okay, though?

03:08:42.255 --> 03:08:43.280
LAURA: Yeah?

03:08:45.975 --> 03:08:47.441
(sighs) Yeah.

03:08:49.545 --> 03:08:54.545
SAM: Should we make camp here on the volcano tonight?

03:08:55.285 --> 03:08:59.485
Or are we going to go down and find another place to sleep?

03:08:59.485 --> 03:09:00.318
It's getting late.

03:09:00.318 --> 03:09:02.915
TRAVIS: Looking around, it's a pretty dope spot.

03:09:02.915 --> 03:09:05.515
LAURA: I know, it's kind of beautiful up here.

03:09:05.515 --> 03:09:07.073
We can make the dome?

03:09:10.275 --> 03:09:11.108
Can we make the dome?

03:09:11.108 --> 03:09:12.645
LIAM: Of course we can make the dome.

03:09:12.645 --> 03:09:14.435
Always we can make the dome.

03:09:14.435 --> 03:09:17.285
MARISHA: Swiped some rum from Kent Pluckner, so--

03:09:18.527 --> 03:09:21.280
SAM: Kent Pluckner?

03:09:21.280 --> 03:09:23.365
MARISHA: Plucker. (laughs)

03:09:23.365 --> 03:09:24.738
No N in that last one.

03:09:24.738 --> 03:09:26.288
TRAVIS: He got a ner.

03:09:30.755 --> 03:09:32.745
ASHLEY: Let's have some rum and celebrate

03:09:32.745 --> 03:09:36.165
this very great accomplishment.

03:09:36.165 --> 03:09:39.755
MARISHA: I mean, rum on the edge
of a volcano at Traveler Con?

03:09:39.755 --> 03:09:40.635
LAURA: Right?

03:09:40.635 --> 03:09:41.545
ASHLEY: Come on, that's pretty cool.

03:09:41.545 --> 03:09:42.545
MARISHA: It's pretty great.

03:09:43.445 --> 03:09:44.925
LAURA: Yeah.

03:09:44.925 --> 03:09:46.775
MATT: Okay. So you guys set up camp here

03:09:46.775 --> 03:09:48.435
at the precipice of Rumblecusp?

03:09:48.435 --> 03:09:49.295
Okay.

03:09:49.295 --> 03:09:51.405
As the night goes on, you take the rum

03:09:51.405 --> 03:09:56.275
that you had brought, reminisce about some things,

03:09:56.275 --> 03:09:57.295
tell some stories.

03:09:57.295 --> 03:09:58.705
You do see down at the village of Vo

03:09:58.705 --> 03:10:01.425
the lights and fires stay lit for the night

03:10:01.425 --> 03:10:04.283
and every now and then you can swear you can still hear

03:10:04.283 --> 03:10:05.895
a little bit of music finding its way up here

03:10:05.895 --> 03:10:07.055
through the wind.

03:10:07.055 --> 03:10:08.955
So at least there's still some semblance of celebration

03:10:08.955 --> 03:10:10.255
still going on down there.

03:10:10.255 --> 03:10:11.805
Not all is lost in that regard.

03:10:13.515 --> 03:10:17.405
As you guys are getting towards the bottom of the rum

03:10:17.405 --> 03:10:20.988
that you brought up, you see a figure approaching,

03:10:22.355 --> 03:10:25.835
and as you glance over and look in a defensive way

03:10:25.835 --> 03:10:28.605
you see a familiar green cloak

03:10:28.605 --> 03:10:32.755
thrown over one shoulder, and beneath that you can see

03:10:32.755 --> 03:10:36.165
this beautiful, deep green, billowing

03:10:36.165 --> 03:10:39.865
silk sleeves that come to these little cuffs

03:10:39.865 --> 03:10:43.615
at the end and these long, thin legs

03:10:43.615 --> 03:10:45.468
and beautifully tailored,

03:10:45.468 --> 03:10:50.015
very elvish-looking attire, and the familiar orange hair

03:10:50.015 --> 03:10:52.841
of Artagan as he steps forward.

03:10:54.315 --> 03:10:57.050
"Do you mind if I have a drink?"

03:10:59.715 --> 03:11:02.015
TRAVIS: You have to speak to the high priestess.

03:11:02.015 --> 03:11:03.625
MATT: "High priestess.

03:11:03.625 --> 03:11:05.367
"Do you mind if I have a drink?"

03:11:05.367 --> 03:11:06.716
LAURA: Sit down.

03:11:06.716 --> 03:11:08.625
LIAM: There's a split second where his hand

03:11:08.625 --> 03:11:11.272
presses against the dome and doesn't go through.

03:11:11.272 --> 03:11:13.065
TRAVIS: Yeah, fuck yeah.

03:11:13.065 --> 03:11:14.390
LIAM: And then it goes.

03:11:15.489 --> 03:11:17.825
MATT: He curls up in, like a friend who comes

03:11:17.825 --> 03:11:21.125
in the middle of the night to your tent when you're camping.

03:11:21.125 --> 03:11:22.733
He's like, "(sighs).

03:11:24.015 --> 03:11:25.031
"May I?"

03:11:26.139 --> 03:11:27.372
LAURA: Of course.

03:11:31.045 --> 03:11:33.976
MARISHA: Ah, one punch.

03:11:33.976 --> 03:11:37.393
One punch.
(laughter)

03:11:38.885 --> 03:11:40.949
MARISHA: It'll feel good. You'll like it. It'll really--

03:11:40.949 --> 03:11:42.393
MATT: "You know what, sure. Go for it."

03:11:42.393 --> 03:11:46.218
All right, roll an attack. (laughs)

03:11:47.105 --> 03:11:50.225
MARISHA: Terribly, for me. 15.

03:11:50.225 --> 03:11:51.075
LIAM: It's the rum.

03:11:51.075 --> 03:11:53.865
MATT: 15? He's letting you do it, so unless it was a one.

03:11:53.865 --> 03:11:55.335
It was more like to see if it would be a one.

03:11:55.335 --> 03:11:58.766
MARISHA: It was more of a slapsies.
MATT: Yeah.

03:11:58.766 --> 03:12:00.241
He like, (impact sound).

03:12:01.697 --> 03:12:03.058
LIAM: Oh, a slapsy.
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:12:03.058 --> 03:12:04.308
(laughter)

03:12:04.308 --> 03:12:06.444
MATT: "Penance paid. Give me that drink."

03:12:06.444 --> 03:12:08.185
MARISHA: I give him the drink.

03:12:10.473 --> 03:12:13.946
MATT: "Well, that was certainly embarrassing."

03:12:14.945 --> 03:12:16.135
LAURA: Could've gone worse.

03:12:16.135 --> 03:12:17.165
MATT: "It could've gone worse.

03:12:17.165 --> 03:12:20.045
"I'm... (sighs)

03:12:20.045 --> 03:12:21.965
"Now that I think back, there's probably a number of reasons

03:12:21.965 --> 03:12:24.565
"why I didn't interact with the Moon Weaver too often."

03:12:25.657 --> 03:12:26.998
LAURA: She's hardcore.

03:12:28.115 --> 03:12:32.455
MATT: "We have some crossover, but apparently--

03:12:33.316 --> 03:12:34.855
"and there's a bit of an image issue,

03:12:34.855 --> 03:12:36.535
"as far as, you know, an issue with other people

03:12:36.535 --> 03:12:37.868
"taking her image.

03:12:38.745 --> 03:12:40.905
"But I give her credit.

03:12:40.905 --> 03:12:44.655
"I now know where those boundaries lie."

03:12:44.655 --> 03:12:45.488
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

03:12:45.488 --> 03:12:46.705
MATT: "If she's listening."

03:12:46.705 --> 03:12:48.375
LAURA: No more fake religion.

03:12:48.375 --> 03:12:49.805
MATT: "Right, right.

03:12:49.805 --> 03:12:50.765
"No, no, no.

03:12:50.765 --> 03:12:53.595
"That was-- we've all had hobbies we tried for a bit

03:12:53.595 --> 03:12:55.875
"and went, this isn't for me, right?"

03:12:55.875 --> 03:12:58.335
LAURA: Knitting. Terrible at it.

03:12:58.335 --> 03:13:00.365
LIAM: In the end, perhaps you achieved

03:13:00.365 --> 03:13:02.323
what you were after after all.

03:13:05.485 --> 03:13:09.338
MATT: "You know, I think it was
time someone took me down a peg."

03:13:13.516 --> 03:13:16.485
LAURA: I'm glad you're not trapped in another realm.

03:13:16.485 --> 03:13:17.815
MATT: "Me, too.

03:13:17.815 --> 03:13:19.963
"Going home would have been terrible.

03:13:23.735 --> 03:13:24.655
"Wow."

03:13:24.655 --> 03:13:26.545
It's very odd to see this entity,

03:13:26.545 --> 03:13:28.975
this powerful archfey, this creature

03:13:28.975 --> 03:13:32.285
that the mystique has surrounded the entirety

03:13:32.285 --> 03:13:33.635
of your relationship with Jester

03:13:33.635 --> 03:13:35.275
for the length that you've known her.

03:13:35.275 --> 03:13:37.675
You've seen this being do incredible things,

03:13:37.675 --> 03:13:40.715
and right now, is just a guy.

03:13:40.715 --> 03:13:42.394
MARISHA: Yeah, I know, it's awkward as fuck.

03:13:42.394 --> 03:13:45.360
LAURA: (laughs)

03:13:46.351 --> 03:13:48.935
MATT: "(sighs)"

03:13:48.935 --> 03:13:50.565
TRAVIS: I'll ask the question.

03:13:50.565 --> 03:13:53.318
What next for you?

03:13:54.535 --> 03:13:55.615
MATT: "Well, thankfully, none of this,"

03:13:55.615 --> 03:13:57.545
and he points out towards the village.

03:13:57.545 --> 03:13:58.378
"This is done.

03:13:58.378 --> 03:14:01.135
"I guess whatever. Whatever interests me,

03:14:01.135 --> 03:14:05.005
"whatever interests come my way, come your way.

03:14:05.005 --> 03:14:06.925
"I don't know.

03:14:06.925 --> 03:14:09.855
"I'm not going to lie.

03:14:09.855 --> 03:14:14.668
"All of that was very... (sighs)

03:14:15.635 --> 03:14:16.935
"not enjoyable.

03:14:18.195 --> 03:14:21.745
"But a great weight has been lifted from these shoulders.

03:14:21.745 --> 03:14:24.895
"But a great weight has been lifted from these shoulders.

03:14:24.895 --> 03:14:27.528
"I'm excited to see what the new day brings.

03:14:29.055 --> 03:14:30.815
"While I'm here, I'm also, by the way,

"down there and just speaking the grandiose praises

03:14:33.895 --> 03:14:35.315
"of the Moon Weaver."

03:14:35.315 --> 03:14:36.365
LAURA: Are you really?

03:14:36.365 --> 03:14:37.198
MATT: "Oh yes.

03:14:37.198 --> 03:14:40.105
"Oh, I think if we're going to do this,

03:14:40.105 --> 03:14:42.448
"we need to finish it properly, so..."

03:14:43.435 --> 03:14:45.775
LAURA: Can you-- wait, so you can actually

03:14:45.775 --> 03:14:47.775
make yourself be in two places at once?

03:14:47.775 --> 03:14:50.515
MATT: "Well, I can make an image
of myself in two places at once."

03:14:50.515 --> 03:14:52.365
LAURA: That can talk?

03:14:52.365 --> 03:14:54.015
MATT: "Can't you?"

03:14:54.015 --> 03:14:57.855
LAURA: No, I can't talk as my double image,

03:14:57.855 --> 03:15:00.925
but maybe you can teach me.

03:15:00.925 --> 03:15:02.415
MATT: "Maybe in time."

03:15:02.415 --> 03:15:06.011
SAM: In time? She just saved you from a fucking god.

03:15:06.011 --> 03:15:07.808
Give it to her now!

03:15:12.555 --> 03:15:14.615
MATT: "Jester, will you walk with me for a moment?"

03:15:14.615 --> 03:15:16.208
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: Hey.

03:15:17.255 --> 03:15:18.736
I'll fucking kill you.

03:15:18.736 --> 03:15:21.175
TRAVIS: (laughs)

03:15:21.175 --> 03:15:22.775
MARISHA: Just, if anything happens.

03:15:22.775 --> 03:15:24.180
SAM: He's got a gun, he's got a gun!

03:15:24.180 --> 03:15:29.180
(laughter)

03:15:29.645 --> 03:15:32.285
MATT: "As comparably diminished as my abilities may be

03:15:32.285 --> 03:15:35.618
"here as opposed to my home plane,

03:15:36.455 --> 03:15:38.955
"that does not leave me incapable of...

"No, no, I believe you,

03:15:41.781 --> 03:15:43.682
"I believe you."
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, exactly.

03:15:43.682 --> 03:15:44.732
MATT: "Thank you for the rum."
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

03:15:44.732 --> 03:15:47.005
MATT: He takes it with him as he walks out the dome.

03:15:47.005 --> 03:15:50.676
MARISHA: Yep. Yep. (whispers) Fuck you, buddy.

03:15:52.961 --> 03:15:55.735
MATT: You walk with him?
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

03:15:55.735 --> 03:15:58.635
MATT: Just walks a bit, doing this sauntering stroll,

03:15:58.635 --> 03:16:01.715
with the sloshing of the jug in one hand,

03:16:01.715 --> 03:16:03.115
and he takes a sip from it

03:16:03.115 --> 03:16:05.276
and passes it over to you.

03:16:09.175 --> 03:16:10.533
"I'm sorry."

03:16:11.495 --> 03:16:14.137
LAURA: Yeah. That was a lot.

03:16:14.137 --> 03:16:17.119
MATT: "Yes, it was."
(muffled voice from Sam's phone)

03:16:17.119 --> 03:16:18.670
SAM: (shouts)

03:16:20.470 --> 03:16:21.895
MATT: "Are we being watched?"

03:16:21.895 --> 03:16:24.245
LAURA: I think the Moon Weaver's back.

03:16:29.141 --> 03:16:32.567
MATT: "No, but genuinely, I'm...

03:16:32.567 --> 03:16:35.076
"I'm a creature of impulse.

"And...

"through the years, but I'm certain a number of my

"And for that I'm sorry.

"But tonight, this...

"Just because one has power doesn't
mean they say all, and...

"from these binds I had unknowingly shackled upon myself

"over the years that I definitely leapt before I looked.

03:17:16.255 --> 03:17:18.815
"The last thing I want to do is put you in harm's way.

"Or any of your friends.

"If I was to be taken, that's my path to walk.

LAURA: I hug him.

03:17:44.668 --> 03:17:46.690
MATT: "Ugh, emotions!"

03:17:46.690 --> 03:17:48.828
LAURA: I know, it's annoying.

03:17:48.828 --> 03:17:51.158
MATT: "It really is. It's insufferable.

03:17:51.158 --> 03:17:54.249
"It's driving me crazy.

03:17:54.249 --> 03:17:56.674
"But no, look.

"and that's not going to change, by any means,

"but I really do appreciate you."

03:18:17.458 --> 03:18:18.948
LAURA: Yeah.

03:18:18.948 --> 03:18:20.788
Don't worry!

03:18:21.808 --> 03:18:24.861
Doesn't have to be so serious all the time.

03:18:25.718 --> 03:18:27.788
MATT: "Thank god.

03:18:27.788 --> 03:18:28.646
"I was just reading the room.

03:18:28.646 --> 03:18:31.211
"I assumed it was one of those serious discussion things."

03:18:33.588 --> 03:18:36.068
LAURA: Yeah, I'm glad you're not gone.

03:18:36.068 --> 03:18:36.980
MATT: "Me, too!

03:18:36.980 --> 03:18:39.008
"That would have been terrifying."

03:18:39.008 --> 03:18:41.158
LAURA: We've learned our lessons.

03:18:41.158 --> 03:18:42.318
MATT: "Yeah.

03:18:42.318 --> 03:18:43.858
"She's a cheeky bit--

"(quieter) Cheeky bitch."

03:18:44.848 --> 03:18:46.038
LAURA: Yeah.

03:18:46.038 --> 03:18:47.991
You know.

03:18:47.991 --> 03:18:52.848
I don't know what this means for everything,

03:18:52.848 --> 03:18:56.171
but we can figure it out.

03:18:57.088 --> 03:18:58.218
MATT: "Know what's exciting?"

03:18:58.218 --> 03:18:59.868
LAURA: Hmm?

03:18:59.868 --> 03:19:01.338
MATT: "Not knowing what's next."

03:19:01.338 --> 03:19:03.964
LAURA: Yeah, It's kind of cool, isn't it?

03:19:05.898 --> 03:19:10.898
MATT: "I don't put much forethought into my plans.

03:19:10.995 --> 03:19:12.428
"And right now in this moment,

"I think I am the least prepared

"for what's next than I've been in a long time."

03:19:18.568 --> 03:19:20.001
LAURA: I'm going to trip him.

03:19:22.348 --> 03:19:24.018
MATT: Go ahead and make an acrobatics check for me.

03:19:24.018 --> 03:19:26.310
LAURA: (laughs)

03:19:28.258 --> 03:19:31.820
LAURA: Oh, nine. Nein!

03:19:31.820 --> 03:19:32.853
TRAVIS: Nein!

03:19:34.218 --> 03:19:36.478
MATT: You go to trip him and it connects with his shin

03:19:36.478 --> 03:19:37.866
and he stops.

03:19:39.609 --> 03:19:42.150
"Ahh?"
LAURA: Ahh?

03:19:45.318 --> 03:19:48.328
A little prepared, then.

03:19:48.328 --> 03:19:49.682
MATT: "Maybe a little, but not by much."

03:19:49.682 --> 03:19:51.057
LAURA: (laughs)

03:19:52.458 --> 03:19:54.361
MATT: "Don't let me take you from your friends.

03:19:55.488 --> 03:19:57.378
"I should probably talk to them too, shouldn't I?"

03:19:57.378 --> 03:19:58.608
LAURA: Yeah, they don't like you.

03:19:58.608 --> 03:19:59.998
MATT: "No, I gathered that.

03:19:59.998 --> 03:20:02.028
"The energy isn't difficult to read, I mean."

03:20:02.028 --> 03:20:03.468
LAURA: Yeah, I just think that

03:20:03.468 --> 03:20:07.868
they think that you are maybe a little manipulative and that

03:20:07.868 --> 03:20:11.408
you don't have our best interests at heart and that you've

03:20:11.408 --> 03:20:13.479
taken advantage of me.

03:20:15.118 --> 03:20:15.951
You know?

03:20:15.951 --> 03:20:18.628
Some of it's based in truth,

03:20:18.628 --> 03:20:20.030
but they don't know you like I do.

03:20:20.030 --> 03:20:22.221
TRAVIS: (laughs)

03:20:22.221 --> 03:20:24.018
MATT: "They're not entirely wrong.

03:20:24.018 --> 03:20:24.993
"Look."

03:20:26.616 --> 03:20:27.649
MARISHA: So toxic.

03:20:29.938 --> 03:20:30.771
MATT: "Hmm.

03:20:31.788 --> 03:20:32.858
"No, they're right.

03:20:32.858 --> 03:20:33.958
"I mean,

03:20:36.198 --> 03:20:38.053
"I'm not trying to defend myself here."
LAURA: No!

03:20:38.053 --> 03:20:40.221
MATT: "My very essence is manipulation."

03:20:40.221 --> 03:20:41.802
LAURA: And I love that about you.

03:20:41.802 --> 03:20:44.324
(laughter)

03:20:44.324 --> 03:20:46.878
TRAVIS: Yeah. Yeah.
SAM: What a weirdo.

03:20:46.878 --> 03:20:49.569
MATT: "I guess I should...

03:20:51.988 --> 03:20:55.068
"I guess I need to just think a little bit more about those

03:20:55.068 --> 03:20:56.493
"I do manipulate."

03:20:57.418 --> 03:20:58.658
LAURA: Yes.

03:20:58.658 --> 03:21:01.208
Also, you need to tell me how to
do that spell where I can make

03:21:01.208 --> 03:21:04.688
myself appear somewhere else and really far away and

03:21:04.688 --> 03:21:07.438
be talking because that is really cool. Because right now,

03:21:07.438 --> 03:21:10.218
what I can do is limited to a certain amount of space,

03:21:10.218 --> 03:21:13.218
but it would be awesome if I could, like, also make myself,

03:21:13.218 --> 03:21:14.728
like, be in the bubble right now,

03:21:14.728 --> 03:21:16.793
talking to them and I could go in and be like:

03:21:16.793 --> 03:21:20.321
Oh my gosh, you guys,
me and the Traveler just broke up.

03:21:23.388 --> 03:21:27.308
MATT: "There are limitations as to
what I can imbue within you,

03:21:27.308 --> 03:21:30.624
"to an extent, but an upgrade perhaps isn't too bad.

03:21:30.624 --> 03:21:33.658
"to an extent, but an upgrade perhaps isn't too bad.

03:21:33.658 --> 03:21:36.508
"How about this--" And he begins to whisper into your ear.

03:21:36.508 --> 03:21:37.341
And as he does,

03:21:37.341 --> 03:21:38.678
you begin to feel your consciousness,

03:21:38.678 --> 03:21:42.208
expand a bit as your illusory duplicate

03:21:42.208 --> 03:21:46.341
emerges next to you, and

03:21:46.341 --> 03:21:49.474
for the foreseeable future,

03:21:49.474 --> 03:21:53.988
your duplicate can now travel twice the distance

03:21:53.988 --> 03:21:57.302
and you can speak through your duplicate.

03:21:57.302 --> 03:22:00.853
LAURA: Oh, holy shit!

03:22:02.338 --> 03:22:04.248
MATT: You can't speak independently.

03:22:04.248 --> 03:22:05.965
You can't like-- it's not a Programmed Illusion.

03:22:05.965 --> 03:22:08.178
You can't have two conversations at once,

03:22:08.178 --> 03:22:11.705
but you do have to be able to see it.

03:22:11.705 --> 03:22:12.805
LAURA: Okay.

03:22:13.831 --> 03:22:14.997
Wow!

03:22:16.925 --> 03:22:18.541
This is awesome.

03:22:18.541 --> 03:22:21.933
Coming from my duplicate.
MATT: "It's just the beginning."

03:22:21.933 --> 03:22:24.252
LAURA: Oh! (stammers)

03:22:24.252 --> 03:22:27.358
I'm going to make my duplicate go into the bubble.

03:22:27.358 --> 03:22:29.158
MATT: Okay, It skips back to the bubble.

03:22:31.224 --> 03:22:33.561
LAURA: Welp, you guys, the Traveler's gone forever.

03:22:34.854 --> 03:22:37.068
As I go in the bubble.

03:22:37.068 --> 03:22:37.901
TRAVIS: How did it go?

03:22:37.901 --> 03:22:38.788
SAM: Gone forever?

03:22:38.788 --> 03:22:41.229
TALIESIN: Am I still having my--

03:22:41.229 --> 03:22:44.208
is my True Sight gone or is it still going?

03:22:44.208 --> 03:22:45.058
MATT: How long does it last?

03:22:45.058 --> 03:22:45.891
TALIESIN: An hour.

03:22:45.891 --> 03:22:46.778
LIAM: No, we've been drinking a lot.

03:22:46.778 --> 03:22:48.998
MATT: You guys have been drinking.

03:22:48.998 --> 03:22:50.678
You know what? Roll a d20 for me.

03:22:50.678 --> 03:22:51.511
TALIESIN: Done.

03:22:51.511 --> 03:22:53.488
MATT: On an 11+, it's still going.

03:22:53.488 --> 03:22:54.338
TALIESIN: Nah, it's over.
SAM: Aww.

03:22:54.338 --> 03:22:55.171
MATT: Okay, sorry.

03:22:57.078 --> 03:22:59.566
SAM: Jester, you're back!

03:22:59.566 --> 03:23:03.467
LAURA: Yep, I'm back, it's me Jester, I'm back!

03:23:03.467 --> 03:23:06.218
Ooh! What a talk I had with the Traveler, you guys!

03:23:06.218 --> 03:23:08.548
He felt so bad, but then he left.

03:23:08.548 --> 03:23:09.828
SAM: He left forever?

03:23:09.828 --> 03:23:10.803
LAURA: Yep, and I just stand there

03:23:10.803 --> 03:23:13.053
in the middle of the bubble, dancing.

03:23:13.053 --> 03:23:14.608
MATT: I will say, Jester,

03:23:14.608 --> 03:23:15.928
go ahead and make a stealth check for me.

03:23:15.928 --> 03:23:17.941
LAURA: Aw, shit. (laughs)

03:23:20.838 --> 03:23:22.521
TRAVIS: Because you're talking (laughs)

03:23:22.521 --> 03:23:24.288
MATT: Because you can speak through your duplicate;

03:23:24.288 --> 03:23:25.937
you can't hear through it.
LAURA: Oh no.

03:23:25.937 --> 03:23:27.978
MATT: So you have to be close
enough to hear the conversation,

03:23:27.978 --> 03:23:29.653
to have one.
LAURA: Right, right, right.

03:23:29.653 --> 03:23:31.099
12.

03:23:31.099 --> 03:23:31.932
MARISHA: (laughs)

03:23:31.932 --> 03:23:34.847
LAURA: As I lean closer so I can hear what's happening.

03:23:34.847 --> 03:23:36.326
MATT: So for...

03:23:37.168 --> 03:23:39.088
everybody but Veth,

03:23:40.113 --> 03:23:42.308
as Jester arrives, you can see

03:23:42.308 --> 03:23:44.618
other Jester crouching behind a rock,

03:23:44.618 --> 03:23:47.922
but excitedly leaning inward.

03:23:47.922 --> 03:23:49.355
LAURA: (humming jaunty ditty)

03:23:49.355 --> 03:23:52.011
SAM: Yeah, this seems like Jester to me. I love her!

03:23:52.011 --> 03:23:53.118
She's the cutest.

03:23:53.118 --> 03:23:55.821
LIAM: You seem very broken up about it.

03:23:55.821 --> 03:23:57.188
Inconsolable, even.

03:23:57.188 --> 03:23:58.618
LAURA: Oh, can't you see I'm crying?

03:23:58.618 --> 03:24:00.398
And my duplicate starts crying.

03:24:00.398 --> 03:24:02.732
SAM: Oh no!
MARISHA: Did the Moon Weaver change her mind,

03:24:02.732 --> 03:24:06.608
come back, was like, "Ah, fuck you, changed my mind"?

03:24:06.608 --> 03:24:08.368
LAURA: Right as Beau says that,

03:24:08.368 --> 03:24:11.218
the real me jumps out from behind a rock and

03:24:11.218 --> 03:24:12.536
runs into the bubble.

03:24:12.536 --> 03:24:15.208
SAM: (screams)
ALL: (exaggerated screaming)

03:24:15.208 --> 03:24:16.695
MARISHA: Shit!
LIAM: Jester!

03:24:16.695 --> 03:24:18.927
MARISHA: Oh my god.
LIAM: What's the meaning of this?

03:24:18.927 --> 03:24:19.760
LAURA: Did it totally fool you guys?

03:24:19.760 --> 03:24:22.143
Did you totally believe it?
MARISHA: Yeah!

03:24:22.143 --> 03:24:23.446
SAM: Genuinely!
TALIESIN: Completely fooled.

03:24:23.446 --> 03:24:24.945
TRAVIS: Two yous?!

03:24:24.945 --> 03:24:26.956
LAURA: With my own voice, you guys!

03:24:26.956 --> 03:24:28.198
TRAVIS: Double prizes!

03:24:28.198 --> 03:24:30.395
MARISHA: That is pretty crazy, yeah.

03:24:30.395 --> 03:24:32.828
MATT: You hear a (thump)

03:24:32.828 --> 03:24:34.401
as the Traveler's hand's on the dome again.

03:24:34.401 --> 03:24:36.680
(laughter)

03:24:36.680 --> 03:24:37.628
LIAM: Yeah, all right.

03:24:37.628 --> 03:24:38.728
MARISHA: Wait, wait, lock it again.

03:24:38.728 --> 03:24:40.382
Just do that thing, like you do in the car.

03:24:40.382 --> 03:24:41.554
(laughter)

03:24:41.554 --> 03:24:44.471
LIAM: I don't know if he can get caught halfway in.

03:24:46.958 --> 03:24:48.778
LAURA: Anyway, he wants to talk to you guys.

03:24:48.778 --> 03:24:51.108
SAM: So he didn't go away forever.

03:24:51.108 --> 03:24:52.746
LAURA: No, he is still totally here.

03:24:52.746 --> 03:24:53.881
SAM: Funny joke.

03:24:53.881 --> 03:24:55.538
MATT: "It was quite a good one.

03:24:55.538 --> 03:24:56.971
"Here's the rest of you."

03:24:56.971 --> 03:25:00.598
He gives you the slosh at the bottom of the jug.

03:25:00.598 --> 03:25:02.264
MARISHA: That's backwash. I'm good.

03:25:02.264 --> 03:25:04.688
MATT: "All right. Waste not, want not.

03:25:06.438 --> 03:25:08.839
"I suppose I should apologize.

03:25:08.839 --> 03:25:13.072
"I've seemingly rubbed a few

03:25:13.072 --> 03:25:15.358
"of you the wrong way over time.

03:25:15.358 --> 03:25:20.358
"And you have every right to be frustrated.

03:25:22.518 --> 03:25:27.468
"Just know, for as much as you care to believe me,

03:25:27.468 --> 03:25:29.938
"I do not want any harm to come to any of you,

03:25:29.938 --> 03:25:32.321
"<i>especially</i> Jester.

03:25:34.071 --> 03:25:36.296
"If anything, to be perfectly frank,

03:25:36.296 --> 03:25:38.863
"and it hates to be frank with anyone,

03:25:40.578 --> 03:25:45.068
"I took some comfort in not having to keep as close an eye

03:25:45.068 --> 03:25:47.168
"on her and recent times because I knew you

03:25:47.168 --> 03:25:48.851
"were all with her.

03:25:49.848 --> 03:25:53.848
"Couldn't say the same for some of the other riff-raff,"

03:25:53.848 --> 03:25:55.798
as he gestures out towards the village,

03:26:00.488 --> 03:26:04.443
"Watching her grow up has been interesting.

03:26:07.818 --> 03:26:09.592
"No, it's been--

03:26:11.376 --> 03:26:13.209
"it's been incredible.

03:26:15.961 --> 03:26:19.468
"Mortal lives are so short and yet filled with so much

03:26:19.468 --> 03:26:23.084
"purpose and drive,

03:26:23.084 --> 03:26:25.498
"and with the right direction,

03:26:25.498 --> 03:26:29.296
"so much chaos.

03:26:33.118 --> 03:26:34.948
"And yet for someone who's been alive as long as I have,

03:26:34.948 --> 03:26:37.348
"I've learned so much just being in her presence.

03:26:42.178 --> 03:26:43.148
"I guess what I'm trying to say

03:26:43.148 --> 03:26:45.961
"is she means a lot to me as well.

03:26:47.798 --> 03:26:50.608
"And if you all mean a lot to her, then in some way,

03:26:50.608 --> 03:26:53.108
"I guess you all mean something to me."

03:26:53.108 --> 03:26:55.391
"(sighs)

03:26:57.304 --> 03:26:59.737
"Remember, it is me behind every healing spell."

03:26:59.737 --> 03:27:00.570
LAURA: (laughs)

03:27:00.570 --> 03:27:03.271
MATT: "So I am helping."

03:27:06.468 --> 03:27:07.838
SAM: That was very nice of you.

03:27:07.838 --> 03:27:10.665
That was very honest and real, and--

03:27:10.665 --> 03:27:12.895
LAURA: Everyone can be best friends now, together?

03:27:12.895 --> 03:27:15.089
MATT: (noncommittal mumbling)

03:27:15.089 --> 03:27:18.364
SAM: She doesn't need you.

03:27:18.364 --> 03:27:21.200
MATT: "Oh, I know she doesn't need me."

03:27:21.200 --> 03:27:22.128
SAM: She doesn't need us either,

03:27:22.128 --> 03:27:23.049
She doesn't need anyone.

03:27:23.049 --> 03:27:24.354
LAURA: Yes I do, yes I do, yes I do, I need you!

03:27:24.354 --> 03:27:25.721
SAM: Nope, you're fine.

03:27:25.721 --> 03:27:26.938
LAURA: I'd be very lonely.

03:27:26.938 --> 03:27:29.768
SAM: Sure, but you would make it.

03:27:30.668 --> 03:27:32.848
ASHLEY: Did you apologize to her?

03:27:32.848 --> 03:27:34.325
MATT: "Did I apologize to you?"

03:27:36.468 --> 03:27:37.628
LAURA: Yes.

03:27:37.628 --> 03:27:38.461
MATT: "Yes."

03:27:39.648 --> 03:27:41.483
MARISHA: Adequately enough?

03:27:42.408 --> 03:27:44.774
LAURA: Yeah. Yeah!

03:27:44.774 --> 03:27:45.676
MATT: "Yeah!"

03:27:45.676 --> 03:27:48.826
SAM: Do you promise you'll never make another cult again?

03:27:48.826 --> 03:27:53.259
MATT: "Oh, dear gods. No, never. That-- ugh."

03:27:55.085 --> 03:27:55.918
TALIESIN: That, I believe.

03:27:55.918 --> 03:27:59.921
MATT: "In the words of the great Sehanine,

03:27:59.921 --> 03:28:01.994
"I've learned my lesson."

03:28:01.994 --> 03:28:03.951
LAURA: (laughs)

03:28:03.951 --> 03:28:05.608
You know,

03:28:05.608 --> 03:28:07.991
I just want to point it out:

03:28:07.991 --> 03:28:10.532
with the costumes,

03:28:10.532 --> 03:28:14.768
and the curtain, and really the stage lighting,

03:28:14.768 --> 03:28:16.759
we put on quite a performance.

03:28:16.759 --> 03:28:17.592
MARISHA: Oh, yeah.

03:28:17.592 --> 03:28:18.838
MATT: "Oh, I'm greatly im--"

03:28:18.838 --> 03:28:22.548
LAURA: That was some of the best theater I've ever seen.

03:28:22.548 --> 03:28:26.308
MATT: "No, no, no. No-no-no-no."
LAURA: All theater.

03:28:26.308 --> 03:28:29.211
MATT: "Those were performing <i>arts</i>."

03:28:29.211 --> 03:28:30.871
TRAVIS: Might have to call Equity and see if this--

03:28:30.871 --> 03:28:32.827
MATT: "No! There was no narrative--"
TRAVIS: -- meets certain guidelines.

03:28:32.827 --> 03:28:34.078
LAURA: There was an audience,

03:28:34.078 --> 03:28:36.356
MATT: There were not acts I, II and III.

03:28:36.356 --> 03:28:37.448
SAM: There were, actually.

03:28:37.448 --> 03:28:38.823
TRAVIS: Sizeable house.
MATT: "This is--!"

03:28:38.823 --> 03:28:40.095
LIAM: There were enough people

03:28:40.095 --> 03:28:42.378
in that village to make at least Lord--
MATT: "Good night!" And he leaves the dome.

03:28:42.378 --> 03:28:44.668
SAM: Lord theater, yes. 99 seat.

03:28:44.668 --> 03:28:45.688
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

03:28:45.688 --> 03:28:47.788
MATT: He's gone.

03:28:47.788 --> 03:28:48.621
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

03:28:48.621 --> 03:28:49.977
MARISHA: It's a lot of opinions about theater.

03:28:49.977 --> 03:28:51.310
TRAVIS: I guess that answers a few questions

03:28:51.310 --> 03:28:52.619
of his power, though, there.

03:28:52.619 --> 03:28:54.638
(laughter)

03:28:54.638 --> 03:28:57.378
ASHLEY: I wanted to ask him what the deal was with Celia.

03:28:57.378 --> 03:28:58.211
LAURA: Ah, shit!

03:28:58.211 --> 03:28:59.044
SAM: What do you mean?
LAURA: I really should have asked him.

03:28:59.044 --> 03:29:00.378
SAM: What do you mean, "what the deal was"?

03:29:00.378 --> 03:29:02.448
ASHLEY: She's just-- ugh.

03:29:02.448 --> 03:29:03.844
MATT: (yelling) "She's just a dick!"

03:29:03.844 --> 03:29:05.998
(laughter)

03:29:05.998 --> 03:29:08.944
"With a dick. Forever."

03:29:08.944 --> 03:29:10.511
LAURA: Forever?! Nott!

03:29:11.368 --> 03:29:13.117
TRAVIS: Yeah, what--
SAM: Oops!

03:29:13.117 --> 03:29:14.788
TRAVIS: What happened to her hand?

03:29:14.788 --> 03:29:18.395
SAM: I glued a dick in her hand forever.

03:29:18.395 --> 03:29:21.191
TRAVIS: When you say forever, what do you mean?

03:29:22.138 --> 03:29:24.545
SAM: Only a Wish spell can take it off.

03:29:24.545 --> 03:29:26.413
(laughter)

03:29:26.413 --> 03:29:29.096
LIAM: Or a machete.

03:29:29.096 --> 03:29:30.808
TRAVIS: Are you serious?

03:29:30.808 --> 03:29:31.748
SAM and LAURA: Yes.

03:29:31.748 --> 03:29:34.556
LAURA: That's really what Nott did.

03:29:34.556 --> 03:29:37.138
TALIESIN: (laughs)

03:29:37.138 --> 03:29:40.798
SAM: This little glue I've been carrying around for a while.

03:29:40.798 --> 03:29:42.511
I've got a couple of drops left,

03:29:43.558 --> 03:29:47.038
so watch yourself while you're asleep!

03:29:47.038 --> 03:29:49.255
TRAVIS: Only a Wish spell?

03:29:49.255 --> 03:29:51.808
LAURA: She's got a permanent golden dick stuck to her hand.

03:29:51.808 --> 03:29:52.721
It's little!

03:29:52.721 --> 03:29:54.040
Probably only this big, like there.

03:29:54.040 --> 03:29:55.638
SAM: She might come for revenge.

03:29:55.638 --> 03:29:58.062
She knows who you are, she knows your name.
TRAVIS: No wonder she tried

03:29:58.062 --> 03:29:59.328
to throw herself in the lava.

03:29:59.328 --> 03:30:01.928
MARISHA: Yeah, honestly, I thought she was trying

03:30:01.928 --> 03:30:04.300
to kill herself, and now I would've let her, had I known.

03:30:04.300 --> 03:30:06.458
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

03:30:06.458 --> 03:30:07.391
MARISHA: Wow.

03:30:07.391 --> 03:30:08.358
LAURA: She sucks.

03:30:08.358 --> 03:30:11.199
MARISHA: What cools villain name is she going to have?

03:30:11.199 --> 03:30:12.850
SAM: The Woman with the Golden Dick.
MARISHA: You know, Celia...

03:30:12.850 --> 03:30:14.516
TRAVIS: Dickhands!
MARISHA: Dickright!

03:30:14.516 --> 03:30:16.815
Yeah, Dickhands, Dick--

03:30:16.815 --> 03:30:17.843
Dickfingers, I don't know.

03:30:17.843 --> 03:30:19.658
TALIESIN: Golddick just writes itself, I feel.

03:30:19.658 --> 03:30:21.348
MARISHA: Golddick, Celia Golddick.

03:30:21.348 --> 03:30:24.301
MATT: Cockballs.
SAM: ♪ Golden wang, golden wang ♪

03:30:24.301 --> 03:30:25.378
TRAVIS: Dickpalm.

03:30:25.378 --> 03:30:26.311
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:30:29.168 --> 03:30:30.001
TRAVIS: Right.

03:30:30.001 --> 03:30:30.834
TRAVIS and LAURA: So.

03:30:30.834 --> 03:30:32.608
LAURA: What next, you guys?

03:30:32.608 --> 03:30:34.328
SAM: What next, indeed.

03:30:35.778 --> 03:30:36.853
TALIESIN: I--

03:30:38.798 --> 03:30:40.931
I'm still dreaming about the Nine Eyes.

03:30:42.028 --> 03:30:42.861
LAURA: Oh no.

03:30:44.708 --> 03:30:46.518
TALIESIN: I don't know what direction that would be

03:30:46.518 --> 03:30:48.608
or what that would entail.

03:30:48.608 --> 03:30:53.498
And I know some of us still have business to take care of,

03:30:53.498 --> 03:30:58.498
but I feel like we can do more than one thing

03:30:58.531 --> 03:30:59.968
at a time.

03:30:59.968 --> 03:31:02.948
LAURA: Maybe we can research the Nine Eyes.

03:31:02.948 --> 03:31:05.458
Find out more from--?

03:31:05.458 --> 03:31:07.396
SAM: In Zadash or something?

03:31:07.396 --> 03:31:09.389
Where was the library again?

03:31:09.389 --> 03:31:11.415
MARISHA: Well, we have several, but

03:31:11.415 --> 03:31:13.645
the one I studied at was in Zadash.

03:31:13.645 --> 03:31:15.588
TRAVIS: And I would like to get Orly

03:31:15.588 --> 03:31:17.899
at least on the deck of that shiny new ship

03:31:17.899 --> 03:31:20.533
and perhaps set him off.

03:31:20.533 --> 03:31:25.518
With Caleb, we don't particularly need to be on it.

03:31:25.518 --> 03:31:28.851
LAURA: It's true
MARISHA: Have Orly sail to Port Damali.

03:31:31.118 --> 03:31:34.329
LIAM: Still have to figure out
how to get that ship out of there.

03:31:34.329 --> 03:31:36.247
MARISHA: We can figure that out.
SAM: You can move water, right?

03:31:36.247 --> 03:31:38.498
TRAVIS: A little Odyssey of the Mind in the morning.
LAURA: Yeah!

03:31:38.498 --> 03:31:41.298
Maybe us combined controlling water--

03:31:41.298 --> 03:31:42.688
you, me and Caduceus--

03:31:42.688 --> 03:31:44.448
we could all move the water enough

03:31:44.448 --> 03:31:45.558
so that we could get a ship out.

03:31:45.558 --> 03:31:47.268
TALIESIN: Also, break out some of the stone

03:31:47.268 --> 03:31:49.068
that's holding it back and open it up

03:31:49.068 --> 03:31:50.744
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: I think it would be more than the water.

03:31:50.744 --> 03:31:51.718
TALIESIN: It doesn't need to be a thing any more.

03:31:51.718 --> 03:31:52.834
LIAM: When we went in, it was like

03:31:52.834 --> 03:31:54.888
five to 10 feet wide, or something like that?

03:31:54.888 --> 03:31:56.838
I got stuck in it as a shark.

03:31:56.838 --> 03:31:58.628
SAM: No, that was--
LIAM: No, no, no.

03:31:58.628 --> 03:32:01.486
I almost got stuck when I went through as a shark earlier.

03:32:01.486 --> 03:32:02.698
MATT: It's wider than five feet.

03:32:02.698 --> 03:32:05.350
It's a 20-foot-wide waterfall there.

03:32:05.350 --> 03:32:07.550
LAURA: Yeah. And with three of us doing Control Water

03:32:07.550 --> 03:32:08.808
combined, it would be enough to

03:32:08.808 --> 03:32:10.099
move the flow.
LIAM: And the biggest ship

03:32:10.099 --> 03:32:11.688
would fit through a 20-foot gap?

03:32:11.688 --> 03:32:13.503
I thought I remember you in the past saying that

03:32:13.503 --> 03:32:15.038
we would need to do more than--

03:32:15.038 --> 03:32:16.398
TRAVIS: Like a ship in the bottle-type thing,

03:32:16.398 --> 03:32:17.287
like the hole wasn't big enough?

03:32:17.287 --> 03:32:19.938
MATT: If you were to split it

03:32:19.938 --> 03:32:22.750
with one person dividing the stream,

03:32:22.750 --> 03:32:24.275
it wouldn't be wide enough for the ship.

03:32:24.275 --> 03:32:25.624
Multiples? Who knows.

03:32:25.624 --> 03:32:26.948
SAM: The water wouldn't be wide enough,

03:32:26.948 --> 03:32:28.398
but the actual cave opening--

03:32:28.398 --> 03:32:29.688
MATT: The cave opening would be wide enough.

03:32:29.688 --> 03:32:30.596
SAM: Yeah.
LIAM: Okay.

03:32:30.596 --> 03:32:32.605
MATT: Correct. All the ships had to get in there somehow.

03:32:32.605 --> 03:32:33.444
SAM: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Yep.

03:32:33.444 --> 03:32:37.378
MATT: And remember, part of the cave edges are illusory.

03:32:37.378 --> 03:32:38.920
LAURA: Oh yeah, that's right.

03:32:40.198 --> 03:32:42.458
TALIESIN: Maybe use some Stone Shape to try and divert some

03:32:42.458 --> 03:32:43.528
of the waterfall.

03:32:43.528 --> 03:32:45.586
LAURA: Oh yeah! Good idea.

03:32:45.586 --> 03:32:48.401
TRAVIS: Okay, so we'll do some research on the Nine Eyes.

03:32:49.368 --> 03:32:50.643
What else?

03:32:53.228 --> 03:32:55.999
LAURA: Essek said he had some stuff he wanted us to do.

03:32:58.688 --> 03:33:00.088
SAM: Lady Vess?

03:33:00.088 --> 03:33:01.908
MARISHA: Yeah.
LAURA: Yeah, she had some stuff

03:33:01.908 --> 03:33:03.148
she wanted us to do.

03:33:03.148 --> 03:33:05.445
MARISHA: But guess it's a bigger question of--

03:33:05.445 --> 03:33:08.828
SAM: I mean, Caleb was talking
about this with us last night.

03:33:08.828 --> 03:33:12.398
MARISHA: Yeah, how big do we want to go in on the Assembly?

03:33:12.398 --> 03:33:14.648
LIAM: What are we about now?

03:33:15.914 --> 03:33:17.872
I-- I-- it's true

03:33:17.872 --> 03:33:22.872
I have been feeling itchy to return

03:33:22.947 --> 03:33:24.713
to the Empire.

03:33:26.518 --> 03:33:31.201
I don't-- I am no leader and I don't control any of you,

03:33:31.201 --> 03:33:33.593
but I was hoping that

03:33:33.593 --> 03:33:37.759
you would return with us.

03:33:39.548 --> 03:33:43.648
I know how things ended on the ocean, but

03:33:45.758 --> 03:33:48.021
I know that it is not finished.

03:33:49.158 --> 03:33:51.391
I don't mean for it to be finished,

03:33:53.178 --> 03:33:57.269
but we are talking about poison in the heart of

03:33:58.420 --> 03:34:00.886
our home and it is not your home.

03:34:02.098 --> 03:34:03.813
So it's a big ask.

03:34:06.905 --> 03:34:11.218
LAURA: <i>You're</i> our home. At least mine.

03:34:11.218 --> 03:34:14.658
TRAVIS: I, personally, don't really have a home.

03:34:14.658 --> 03:34:17.807
It's been reinvented so many times.

03:34:17.807 --> 03:34:19.991
If it bothers you, it bothers me.

03:34:23.009 --> 03:34:26.959
TALIESIN: I'm not ready to be a vigilante, but

03:34:26.959 --> 03:34:29.018
I'm at your service.

03:34:29.018 --> 03:34:31.563
There are some things I won't do, but

03:34:33.158 --> 03:34:37.818
if you know what you need, I'm ready to talk about it.

03:34:38.918 --> 03:34:42.488
LIAM: Well, as a start, I wish to know more,

03:34:42.488 --> 03:34:44.469
which I think you could be on board with?

03:34:44.469 --> 03:34:45.319
TALIESIN: Always.

03:34:48.128 --> 03:34:52.526
TRAVIS: Do you have a feeling of
how you want to approach this?

03:34:53.398 --> 03:34:54.548
Well...

03:34:56.906 --> 03:34:58.189
I don't know the heart of the King,

03:34:58.189 --> 03:35:02.618
and I'm not sure how quickly who would need to assess that,

03:35:02.618 --> 03:35:07.042
but his partners are a mixed bag

03:35:07.042 --> 03:35:09.283
and it's hard to know which ones

03:35:09.283 --> 03:35:12.356
are the bad pennies or if they are all bad pennies.

03:35:15.028 --> 03:35:17.753
I feel like we need to spend some time with them.

03:35:18.608 --> 03:35:23.608
So perhaps DeRogna's invite

03:35:24.241 --> 03:35:26.790
would be a way to begin.

03:35:26.790 --> 03:35:29.458
LAURA: Oh yeah, get in with her good.

03:35:29.458 --> 03:35:31.570
Find out what she's about.

03:35:31.570 --> 03:35:32.918
LIAM: Get closer.

03:35:32.918 --> 03:35:37.376
See if we can get a read on her

03:35:37.376 --> 03:35:40.292
and branch out from there.

03:35:41.958 --> 03:35:42.791
TRAVIS: Just to be clear,

03:35:42.791 --> 03:35:47.738
you're talking about taking her up on the bounty where we go

03:35:47.738 --> 03:35:50.918
north and explore the-- hmm.

03:35:50.918 --> 03:35:52.828
LIAM: Yeah.
TRAVIS: I mean, if we have to.

03:35:52.828 --> 03:35:54.169
SAM: What's wrong?
LAURA: (laughs)

03:35:54.169 --> 03:35:55.594
SAM: Why don't you want to go up there?

03:35:55.594 --> 03:35:56.688
TRAVIS: No, I do!

03:35:56.688 --> 03:35:57.521
SAM: Why?

03:35:57.521 --> 03:35:59.848
TRAVIS: I just think it sounds fucking thrilling.

03:35:59.848 --> 03:36:03.778
SAM: Oh, you don't have any personal stake or anything.

03:36:03.778 --> 03:36:06.058
TRAVIS: Nope, I just remember very well to what it was like

03:36:06.058 --> 03:36:08.528
when every day sort of blended into the next

03:36:08.528 --> 03:36:13.498
and when I'm with you fuckers, that is just not a problem.

03:36:13.498 --> 03:36:16.091
So, I'm all for it.

03:36:17.328 --> 03:36:21.348
LIAM: Well, it's interesting also because there will

03:36:21.348 --> 03:36:25.714
be some fascinating things to be found up there.

03:36:26.688 --> 03:36:27.521
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:36:27.521 --> 03:36:31.428
LIAM: Stuff left behind in a bygone era.

03:36:31.428 --> 03:36:33.358
MARISHA: Super old stuff.

03:36:33.358 --> 03:36:35.130
LIAM: Yeah, old magic.

03:36:35.130 --> 03:36:35.963
LAURA: Oh!

03:36:35.963 --> 03:36:36.796
TRAVIS: Really?

03:36:38.081 --> 03:36:38.914
TALIESIN: (chuckles)

03:36:38.914 --> 03:36:39.747
LIAM: Really?
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:36:41.488 --> 03:36:43.081
TRAVIS: That's fine. No bigs.

03:36:44.118 --> 03:36:45.310
LAURA: That's exciting.

03:36:46.658 --> 03:36:48.758
LIAM: And your buddy buds will still

03:36:48.758 --> 03:36:52.308
be there for you every step of the way?

03:36:52.308 --> 03:36:53.623
LAURA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Good.

03:36:54.898 --> 03:36:55.731
LAURA: Yeah.

03:36:55.731 --> 03:36:58.268
MARISHA: Is he going to, like, come with us?

03:36:58.268 --> 03:36:59.854
Because he's really not invited.

03:36:59.854 --> 03:37:01.078
TRAVIS: (choked laughter)

03:37:01.078 --> 03:37:02.255
LAURA: Beau--
TALIESIN: Technically been--

03:37:02.255 --> 03:37:03.482
LAURA: -- regard.

03:37:03.482 --> 03:37:04.408
MARISHA: What?

03:37:04.408 --> 03:37:07.916
LAURA: Here's the thing.
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

03:37:07.916 --> 03:37:10.499
LAURA: He's kind of with me all the time.

03:37:10.499 --> 03:37:12.518
He's other places, too.

03:37:12.518 --> 03:37:14.158
Definitely.

03:37:14.158 --> 03:37:18.849
But, like, when we're fighting,

03:37:18.849 --> 03:37:20.174
he's with us.

03:37:21.058 --> 03:37:24.338
When I'm healing you, he's with us.
MARISHA: I don't want to interact with him, though.

03:37:24.338 --> 03:37:27.148
LAURA: Probably not too much.
MARISHA: Okay, that's fine, then.

03:37:27.148 --> 03:37:29.323
LAURA: Okay.
ASHLEY: But do you have privacy?

03:37:30.358 --> 03:37:33.608
LAURA: Oh! Yeah!

03:37:33.608 --> 03:37:35.308
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:37:35.308 --> 03:37:36.699
LAURA: I mean...

03:37:40.020 --> 03:37:44.068
Yeah! I guess we don't always know when he's there, huh?

03:37:44.068 --> 03:37:45.368
That's weird.

03:37:45.368 --> 03:37:46.578
MARISHA: Hmm.

03:37:46.578 --> 03:37:48.908
LAURA: I hadn't really thought about
it as a weird thing before.

03:37:48.908 --> 03:37:51.301
It was always kind of a comforting thing.

03:37:52.749 --> 03:37:54.580
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah.

03:37:54.580 --> 03:37:56.871
TRAVIS: I'm sure it's not a weird thing, right?

03:37:56.871 --> 03:37:58.668
Sometimes he's too busy and stuff, so--

03:37:58.668 --> 03:38:00.251
LAURA: Yeah, yeah!
MARISHA: Oh, there's no way

03:38:00.251 --> 03:38:01.643
it's <i>not</i> a weird thing.

03:38:01.643 --> 03:38:04.144
(laughter)

03:38:04.144 --> 03:38:04.977
TRAVIS: True.

03:38:06.528 --> 03:38:08.438
LIAM: Well, she's a trickery cleric.

03:38:08.438 --> 03:38:09.979
It's right on the label, so...

03:38:09.979 --> 03:38:10.987
LAURA: Yeah.

03:38:12.725 --> 03:38:13.558
Yeah.

03:38:16.928 --> 03:38:18.358
MARISHA: All right.

03:38:18.358 --> 03:38:20.598
LIAM: Okay.
SAM: So we sleep here and--

03:38:20.598 --> 03:38:22.428
LAURA: Go get a boat and then--

03:38:22.428 --> 03:38:23.678
SAM: Okay, okay.

03:38:23.678 --> 03:38:24.858
MATT: All right.

03:38:24.858 --> 03:38:26.178
SAM: Anything else we need from the town

03:38:26.178 --> 03:38:27.048
before we leave or are we

03:38:27.048 --> 03:38:30.743
just going to leave, ghost.

03:38:30.743 --> 03:38:32.228
TRAVIS: We should go mine some jewels

03:38:32.228 --> 03:38:34.928
in the really dangerous part of the island.

03:38:34.928 --> 03:38:36.128
TALIESIN: I think there's nothing wrong with

03:38:36.128 --> 03:38:37.653
saying goodbye.
LAURA: Yeah, we'll pass through

03:38:37.653 --> 03:38:39.738
in the morning, say goodbye, and then head out.

03:38:39.738 --> 03:38:40.571
SAM: Okay.

03:38:40.571 --> 03:38:42.494
ASHLEY: There's part of the map we didn't explore.

03:38:42.494 --> 03:38:44.638
(laughter)
ASHLEY: One more level!

03:38:44.638 --> 03:38:45.858
MARISHA: Always in the fog.

03:38:45.858 --> 03:38:47.304
TRAVIS: So hard for me.

03:38:48.775 --> 03:38:50.568
MARISHA: What about you, Veth?

03:38:50.568 --> 03:38:52.598
SAM: Huh? Wh-wh-who? What?

03:38:52.598 --> 03:38:53.638
Who me?

03:38:53.638 --> 03:38:56.393
TRAVIS and SAM: (monkey noises)

03:38:56.393 --> 03:38:57.809
TALIESIN: (owl noises)

03:38:57.809 --> 03:38:59.546
MARISHA: Oh god, this island, no.

03:38:59.546 --> 03:39:02.329
(laughter)
SAM: Monkey Island!

03:39:03.421 --> 03:39:04.254
TRAVIS: Yes!

03:39:07.028 --> 03:39:11.495
SAM: I would very much like to pass through--

03:39:11.495 --> 03:39:12.328
MARISHA: Felderwin?

03:39:12.328 --> 03:39:13.458
Or no, they're in--

03:39:13.458 --> 03:39:14.291
SAM: No.

03:39:14.291 --> 03:39:15.124
LAURA: They're in Nicodranas.

03:39:15.124 --> 03:39:16.828
SAM: Nicodranas, yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:39:16.828 --> 03:39:18.558
LIAM: We could start there. We could--

03:39:18.558 --> 03:39:19.391
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:39:19.391 --> 03:39:23.688
LIAM: -- take a little vacation after our vacation.

03:39:23.688 --> 03:39:26.727
MARISHA: Ah, gods, I need a vacation after this vacation.

03:39:26.727 --> 03:39:28.468
(laughter)

03:39:28.468 --> 03:39:29.842
TALIESIN: We have a friend we can talk to about

03:39:29.842 --> 03:39:31.358
the Nine Eyes there as well.

03:39:31.358 --> 03:39:33.880
LAURA: Oh yeah! I bet he would have some good ideas.

03:39:33.880 --> 03:39:34.988
TALIESIN: Yeah, he might.

03:39:34.988 --> 03:39:36.678
SAM: Also, there was this idea--

03:39:36.678 --> 03:39:37.728
maybe it was my own

03:39:37.728 --> 03:39:39.888
and I'm saying that it was all of ours,

03:39:39.888 --> 03:39:41.998
but it was this idea at some point that you were going to

03:39:41.998 --> 03:39:43.939
try to Parent Trap your parents?

03:39:43.939 --> 03:39:46.797
(laughter)

03:39:46.797 --> 03:39:48.278
SAM: Isn't that a thing,

03:39:48.278 --> 03:39:49.848
or am I making that up?

03:39:49.848 --> 03:39:51.499
LAURA: No, that was a thing.

03:39:52.468 --> 03:39:55.708
SAM: Maybe we could lay some seeds while we're there.

03:39:56.748 --> 03:39:58.358
MARISHA: Maybe she can travel with us

03:39:58.358 --> 03:40:00.888
to Zadash. Relocate.

03:40:00.888 --> 03:40:02.537
LAURA: I don't think she'll want to do that.

03:40:02.537 --> 03:40:04.370
SAM: Maybe just a letter.

03:40:05.737 --> 03:40:06.991
LAURA: Yeah, you know what?

03:40:06.991 --> 03:40:11.041
I haven't talked to my mom or dad in a while.

03:40:11.041 --> 03:40:13.100
Should send them some messages.

03:40:17.425 --> 03:40:19.265
TALIESIN: Yeah, I feel that.
LIAM: Yeah.

03:40:19.265 --> 03:40:22.166
LIAM: Well, it's an easy trip to Nicodranas,

03:40:22.166 --> 03:40:23.918
once we get Orly on his way.

03:40:23.918 --> 03:40:24.918
LAURA: Yeah.

03:40:24.918 --> 03:40:26.588
TALIESIN: Good idea.

03:40:26.588 --> 03:40:28.338
SAM: All right.

03:40:28.338 --> 03:40:29.685
MATT: Okay.

03:40:29.685 --> 03:40:30.962
MARISHA: Caduceus?

03:40:30.962 --> 03:40:32.403
TALIESIN: Hmm?
MARISHA: Yasha?

03:40:32.403 --> 03:40:34.836
Any unfinished business?

03:40:36.278 --> 03:40:37.366
TALIESIN: Like right now?

03:40:37.366 --> 03:40:38.876
LAURA: (laughs)

03:40:40.018 --> 03:40:41.608
MARISHA: Sure.

03:40:41.608 --> 03:40:43.738
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm fine.

03:40:43.738 --> 03:40:45.485
TRAVIS: (wheezes)

03:40:45.485 --> 03:40:49.318
TALIESIN: I'm just paying some debts now.

03:40:50.658 --> 03:40:54.008
I'm not done traveling and I feel like I owe each and every

03:40:54.008 --> 03:40:55.478
one of you and--

03:40:55.478 --> 03:40:57.728
MARISHA: You think the Grove is okay?

03:40:57.728 --> 03:40:58.561
TALIESIN: Yes.

03:40:59.718 --> 03:41:01.008
I'll look at it when I'm ready,

03:41:01.008 --> 03:41:03.665
but yes, I think it's--

03:41:03.665 --> 03:41:05.090
I think it's fine.

03:41:08.258 --> 03:41:13.088
But I'll be content once I feel like everyone's

03:41:13.088 --> 03:41:14.504
on their way.

03:41:17.378 --> 03:41:19.685
TRAVIS: So I suppose that concludes

03:41:19.685 --> 03:41:24.332
the first and last Traveler Con 3000?

03:41:24.332 --> 03:41:26.310
LAURA: Moon Weaver Con 3000.

03:41:26.310 --> 03:41:29.265
TRAVIS: Closing ceremonies, you
know, everybody goes to those.

03:41:29.265 --> 03:41:32.407
(laughter)

03:41:33.808 --> 03:41:34.877
LAURA: Yeah...

03:41:34.877 --> 03:41:35.727
SAM: Yeah...

03:41:35.727 --> 03:41:36.628
LAURA: Yeah.

03:41:36.628 --> 03:41:38.838
MATT: Sunday at 9:00am.

03:41:38.838 --> 03:41:39.671
LAURA: Yeah.

03:41:40.538 --> 03:41:43.814
We'll just let it do its thing.

03:41:45.538 --> 03:41:46.563
MATT: Okay.

03:41:47.648 --> 03:41:49.401
MATT: You guys sleep for the evening.

03:41:50.488 --> 03:41:54.633
Restful, exhausted, necessary sleep.

03:41:55.758 --> 03:41:59.331
In the morning, the clouds part a little bit.

03:41:59.331 --> 03:42:01.338
There is a faint mist in the air.

03:42:01.338 --> 03:42:06.338
Not the mist that greeted you, but just a cooler day.

03:42:06.998 --> 03:42:10.388
As you make your way down to the mountain, into the village,

03:42:10.388 --> 03:42:15.388
in which many folks, most folks have begun to pack up.

03:42:15.478 --> 03:42:17.288
Many of which were hungover.

03:42:17.288 --> 03:42:19.488
And it seems that through the night,

03:42:19.488 --> 03:42:22.228
just at a glance and a few conversations,

03:42:22.228 --> 03:42:25.336
much of the tumult and intense aggression that began to

03:42:25.336 --> 03:42:27.961
much of the tumult and intense aggression that began to

03:42:27.961 --> 03:42:32.866
emerge after the strange end of Traveler Con,

03:42:34.098 --> 03:42:37.298
there was a lot of drunken philosophizing

03:42:38.878 --> 03:42:42.998
goaded on by both the Traveler himself,

03:42:42.998 --> 03:42:44.578
making the rounds through the evening

03:42:44.578 --> 03:42:46.604
celebrations and arguments,

03:42:47.708 --> 03:42:51.818
and apparently a series of faint dreams that visited many of

03:42:51.818 --> 03:42:53.908
these people that seem to guide them

03:42:53.908 --> 03:42:56.440
across beautiful silver moonlight.

03:42:58.878 --> 03:43:01.031
But therein lies

03:43:02.278 --> 03:43:04.719
a handful of folks that wish to stay,

03:43:04.719 --> 03:43:05.760
enjoying this village of Vo.

03:43:05.760 --> 03:43:09.318
Individuals that, through the Traveler, found purpose from

03:43:09.318 --> 03:43:12.148
a life that seemed to have none.

03:43:12.148 --> 03:43:14.968
One of which is an old gnoll named Covak,

03:43:14.968 --> 03:43:17.808
who has decided to stay on the island itself,

03:43:17.808 --> 03:43:20.528
but the village of Vo has blossomed once more into

03:43:20.528 --> 03:43:25.476
a good, healthy, 90 or so people.

03:43:27.178 --> 03:43:29.851
LAURA: Are any of them looking like actual fighters,

03:43:30.898 --> 03:43:33.443
people that can, like, protect the village.

03:43:33.443 --> 03:43:35.131
MATT: There are a handful, yeah.
LAURA: Okay, good.

03:43:35.131 --> 03:43:38.938
MATT: Yeah, not like, you know,
your scale of adventurers, per se,

03:43:38.938 --> 03:43:43.938
but there are those who are being given the rounds of

03:43:44.278 --> 03:43:46.658
what protections are still have been set by Vilya,

03:43:46.658 --> 03:43:48.288
what things to be worried about in the village.

03:43:48.288 --> 03:43:50.638
And there is definitely a preparation,

03:43:54.518 --> 03:43:57.311
a guiding class that is going on.

03:43:58.598 --> 03:44:00.308
But you go ahead and say your goodbyes,

03:44:00.308 --> 03:44:02.108
the handful of villagers that you made

03:44:02.108 --> 03:44:04.858
some connections with, such as Kellbast

03:44:04.858 --> 03:44:07.933
who joined you for the evening's hug,

03:44:09.398 --> 03:44:12.038
as well as some of the others that you had met throughout

03:44:12.038 --> 03:44:13.788
the village that are staying behind.

03:44:14.628 --> 03:44:17.348
You pack up your things and make your way to

03:44:17.348 --> 03:44:18.651
the Heaven Falls.

03:44:19.698 --> 03:44:22.983
As before, you make your way into the waters of the lagoon,

03:44:22.983 --> 03:44:25.148
and through the combined effort of the three of you

03:44:25.148 --> 03:44:26.798
controlling water,

03:44:26.798 --> 03:44:30.038
you do manage to open enough where you feel semi-confident

03:44:30.038 --> 03:44:33.678
that some of these boats can be brought through.

03:44:33.678 --> 03:44:35.178
How long does that spell last?

03:44:36.228 --> 03:44:37.258
LAURA: Control Water?

03:44:37.258 --> 03:44:38.308
MATT: Control Water, yes.

03:44:42.118 --> 03:44:43.378
LAURA: Up to 10 minutes.

03:44:43.378 --> 03:44:44.211
MATT: Okay.

03:44:44.211 --> 03:44:45.538
LAURA: So it needs to be like right as it gets there.

03:44:45.538 --> 03:44:47.078
MATT: You can get a ship out.

03:44:47.078 --> 03:44:48.328
LAURA: Yeah.

03:44:48.328 --> 03:44:50.948
MATT: Or possibly a couple of smaller ones,

03:44:50.948 --> 03:44:52.958
but are you helping get all the ships through or you

03:44:52.958 --> 03:44:54.278
just retrieving your own?

03:44:54.278 --> 03:44:56.878
TRAVIS: I can only help with one for the day.

03:44:56.878 --> 03:44:58.958
TALIESIN: I've got tons.

03:44:58.958 --> 03:45:00.049
LAURA: I know, we can--

03:45:00.049 --> 03:45:02.298
MATT: You don't need all three of you for all the ships,

03:45:02.298 --> 03:45:03.658
just for the larger, yeah.
LAURA: Just the big ship?

03:45:03.658 --> 03:45:05.459
Okay, so we'll all work together for the big ship

03:45:05.459 --> 03:45:08.518
and then Caduceus and I will
work together for a few of the smaller ones.

03:45:08.518 --> 03:45:10.184
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: Eden's Horizon.

03:45:10.184 --> 03:45:13.918
MATT: Okay. We'll say over the better part of the afternoon,

03:45:13.918 --> 03:45:17.208
you were able to, with Orly and the rest of your crew--

03:45:17.208 --> 03:45:18.041
TALIESIN: I've got six.

03:45:18.041 --> 03:45:20.858
MATT: -- get the remainder of the ships that still stand,

03:45:20.858 --> 03:45:24.975
leaving the burned wreckage of the few in the cavern,

03:45:24.975 --> 03:45:27.896
and bring them out to past the lagoon into the water

03:45:27.896 --> 03:45:32.198
shortly offshore on the
eastern side of Rumblecusp to drop anchor

03:45:32.198 --> 03:45:36.598
for those of the island that wish to keep or take them home.

03:45:36.598 --> 03:45:41.598
But Eden's Horizon is freed from its cavern prison.

03:45:42.808 --> 03:45:45.866
Orly and the crew gather up on the deck

03:45:45.866 --> 03:45:48.057
with supplies from the village of Vo,

03:45:48.057 --> 03:45:51.688
enough to get themselves back to the Menagerie Coast.

03:45:51.688 --> 03:45:53.808
Orly looks back over the rest of you,

03:45:53.808 --> 03:45:58.798
smiles his cracked, dry tortle grin.

03:46:01.338 --> 03:46:05.613
"Looking forward to seeing the lot of you back. Cap'n."

03:46:05.613 --> 03:46:09.548
"Looking forward to seeing the lot of you back. Cap'n."

03:46:09.548 --> 03:46:11.048
TRAVIS: She's a lot of ship.

03:46:11.048 --> 03:46:12.174
You're sure you're up for this?

03:46:12.174 --> 03:46:14.961
MATT: "(chuckles)

03:46:14.961 --> 03:46:18.452
"I know how to handle a fine woman,"

03:46:20.052 --> 03:46:22.160
and he pats the side.

03:46:22.160 --> 03:46:23.578
TRAVIS: I do not doubt it.

03:46:23.578 --> 03:46:26.948
LAURA: I'm going to paint the side just so Eden's Horizon

03:46:26.948 --> 03:46:28.638
isn't on there any more.

03:46:28.638 --> 03:46:30.246
MATT: What is it now?
LAURA: Officially claimed

03:46:30.246 --> 03:46:32.368
for the Nein Heroez.

03:46:32.368 --> 03:46:33.548
MATT: Is there a new name for the ship?

03:46:33.548 --> 03:46:34.564
SAM: Yeah.
LAURA: Nine Heroez.

03:46:34.564 --> 03:46:36.899
MATT: Oh, the Nein Heroez? Okay!

03:46:36.899 --> 03:46:38.974
LAURA: Nott figured it.
SAM: Got to rearrange the letters.

03:46:38.974 --> 03:46:41.233
LIAM: Is it spelled N-E-I-N?

03:46:41.233 --> 03:46:42.958
LAURA: N-E-I-N, yeah.

03:46:42.958 --> 03:46:44.568
SAM: Yeah, sure!

03:46:44.568 --> 03:46:47.658
MATT: All right, the ship known as the Nein Heroez

03:46:47.658 --> 03:46:48.866
begins to make its way--
TRAVIS: With a 'z.'

03:46:48.866 --> 03:46:50.129
LAURA: Yeah.

03:46:50.129 --> 03:46:50.962
TALIESIN: That's a good pun.

03:46:50.962 --> 03:46:52.617
LIAM: No Heroez.
MATT: -- back towards the coast--

03:46:52.617 --> 03:46:53.450
MARISHA: No Heroez.

03:46:53.450 --> 03:46:54.566
MATT: -- the Menagerie Coast.

03:46:56.568 --> 03:46:58.818
And with that, you feel the--

03:46:58.818 --> 03:47:03.818
for the time being, your work is
pretty solidly done here on Rumblecusp.

03:47:03.823 --> 03:47:06.139
So what would you like to do?

03:47:07.955 --> 03:47:09.702
LIAM: Want to go see your mom?

03:47:09.702 --> 03:47:10.750
LAURA: Let's go.

03:47:10.750 --> 03:47:11.583
LIAM: All right.

03:47:11.583 --> 03:47:12.416
MARISHA: Before we go--

03:47:12.416 --> 03:47:15.098
LIAM: Start drawing circles on the wood.

03:47:15.098 --> 03:47:18.048
MARISHA: While he draws circles, I want to go up to Anola.

03:47:18.048 --> 03:47:18.881
Is that what her name was?

03:47:18.881 --> 03:47:19.858
SAM: Yeah, the cook?

03:47:19.858 --> 03:47:21.491
MATT: Old woman? Yeah.

03:47:21.491 --> 03:47:22.728
MARISHA: I give her 50 gold.

03:47:26.255 --> 03:47:27.618
Remind me.

03:47:27.618 --> 03:47:31.148
I lost how much our share was, so

03:47:31.148 --> 03:47:36.148
I'll get that after the game.
LAURA: Oh. Yeah, I'll get you the number.

03:47:37.815 --> 03:47:39.958
MATT: "Thank you very much."

03:47:39.958 --> 03:47:42.811
MARISHA: Make this place dope.

03:47:44.038 --> 03:47:47.550
It can be a great vacation spot, like a little timeshare.

03:47:47.550 --> 03:47:50.215
MATT: "I'll do my best, I promise."
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

03:47:51.188 --> 03:47:54.698
Maybe name this bar that we built for Traveler Con

03:47:54.698 --> 03:47:56.338
after me.

03:47:56.338 --> 03:47:57.448
You're fine with that, like the Lionett--

03:47:57.448 --> 03:47:58.864
MATT: "The Beau Bar?"

03:48:00.280 --> 03:48:01.598
MARISHA: Fuck, that's better!

03:48:01.598 --> 03:48:03.078
Fuck, that's better than what I had.

03:48:03.078 --> 03:48:05.551
Yeah, call it the fucking Beau Bar, that's great.

03:48:05.551 --> 03:48:08.218
MATT: "All right. Everyone,
welcome to the Fucking Beau Bar!"

03:48:08.218 --> 03:48:10.155
MARISHA: Yes, even better!

03:48:10.155 --> 03:48:12.565
LAURA: What if it's the BeaureBar?

03:48:12.565 --> 03:48:14.511
MARISHA: The BeaureBar?!

03:48:14.511 --> 03:48:15.958
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

03:48:15.958 --> 03:48:17.542
MARISHA: That's great.

03:48:17.542 --> 03:48:21.003
MARISHA: The Fucking BeaureBar!
MATT: "The Fucking BeaureBar!"

03:48:21.003 --> 03:48:25.928
MARISHA: Yeah! That's great.
Put a fucking plaque, if you don't mind,

03:48:25.928 --> 03:48:29.038
over it, and then maybe we'll be back in, like, a year

03:48:29.038 --> 03:48:31.498
and we'll vacation here and just, like, remember this.

03:48:31.498 --> 03:48:33.828
MATT: "Well, I think we'd all look forward to that."

03:48:33.828 --> 03:48:35.878
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm not saying want, like, you know,

03:48:35.878 --> 03:48:39.221
freebies or, like, a timeshare, but, like,

03:48:39.221 --> 03:48:40.313
you know, just don't forget.

03:48:40.313 --> 03:48:42.568
MATT: "We'll deal with it then, it's fine."
MARISHA: Okay then, thank you.

03:48:42.568 --> 03:48:44.148
Yeah.
MATT: "Thank you."

03:48:44.148 --> 03:48:44.981
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:48:46.528 --> 03:48:47.717
SAM: Nicely done!

03:48:47.717 --> 03:48:49.008
MARISHA: Thanks!
TRAVIS: You know,

03:48:49.008 --> 03:48:50.488
two better ideas were floated out

03:48:50.488 --> 03:48:54.016
in like five seconds. What were you going to start with?

03:48:54.016 --> 03:48:55.766
MARISHA: Oh, like, the Lionett Bar

03:48:55.766 --> 03:48:57.335
or some bullshit.
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's dogshit.

03:48:57.335 --> 03:48:58.435
It's terrible.
LAURA: It's all you!

03:48:58.435 --> 03:48:59.878
TRAVIS: No more names from you.
MARISHA: Yeah, my lineage is no one--

03:48:59.878 --> 03:49:02.544
Yeah, none of that matters.

03:49:02.544 --> 03:49:03.377
Yeah.

03:49:03.377 --> 03:49:06.044
SAM: It's nice here. We should come back, you know.

03:49:06.044 --> 03:49:09.268
It's hard to get into the V.O. community,
but then once you're in,

03:49:09.268 --> 03:49:13.358
you're in forever.
LIAM: They're the nicest people, too.

03:49:13.358 --> 03:49:15.298
Jester, before I finish all of this,

03:49:15.298 --> 03:49:19.098
could we once, just a sing--
for the first time ever, please

03:49:19.098 --> 03:49:21.478
warn Yussa that we are coming.

03:49:21.478 --> 03:49:23.478
LAURA: Oh, I was planning on it fully.

03:49:23.478 --> 03:49:25.623
LIAM: We have planned on it every time, fully.

03:49:25.623 --> 03:49:27.121
So maybe this time we will do it.

03:49:27.121 --> 03:49:29.485
LAURA: Okay, before I send him that message,

03:49:29.485 --> 03:49:31.518
is Kellbast still around?

03:49:31.518 --> 03:49:32.898
MATT: Yes!
LAURA: Is he already gone?

03:49:32.898 --> 03:49:35.588
Before we go, I'm just going to go up to Kellbast and say:

03:49:35.588 --> 03:49:39.363
Where in Exandria are you from again?

03:49:39.363 --> 03:49:44.183
MATT: "Oh, well I've moved quite a bit around the

03:49:44.183 --> 03:49:49.183
"the Menagerie Coast. I'm originally from Port Zoon,

03:49:49.278 --> 03:49:50.828
"but I made my way up to Feolinn

03:49:50.828 --> 03:49:52.078
"because the Plumgroves up there

03:49:52.078 --> 03:49:55.678
"gives nice wood that you can sculpt into some very

03:49:55.678 --> 03:49:57.531
"soft wood furniture.

03:49:58.728 --> 03:50:00.898
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: "You ever been to Feolinn?"

03:50:00.898 --> 03:50:01.731
LAURA: I haven't, but

03:50:01.731 --> 03:50:04.448
we should make a trip there because you're wonderful.

03:50:04.448 --> 03:50:06.301
MATT: "No, you're wonderful."

03:50:09.364 --> 03:50:11.053
LAURA: I want to insight check him.

03:50:11.053 --> 03:50:11.886
MATT: Make an insight check!

03:50:11.886 --> 03:50:13.214
TRAVIS: He's a mass murderer.

03:50:13.214 --> 03:50:14.361
(laughter)

03:50:14.361 --> 03:50:15.744
LAURA: I wasn't so worried.

03:50:15.744 --> 03:50:17.711
Now that I'm talking to him, I'm like, "Oh no."

03:50:17.711 --> 03:50:18.885
MARISHA: Six more weeks on Vo!

03:50:18.885 --> 03:50:21.778
TRAVIS: Notice this line along his jaw.
LAURA: Yeah, I only got ten.

03:50:21.778 --> 03:50:24.279
LIAM: (like Kellbast) You can make real soft furniture!

03:50:24.279 --> 03:50:26.012
(laughter)

03:50:26.012 --> 03:50:27.595
MATT: Come back to Rumblecusp a year from now

03:50:27.595 --> 03:50:29.970
and it's just desolated.

03:50:29.970 --> 03:50:30.803
LAURA: Yeah!

03:50:30.803 --> 03:50:33.958
MATT: It's just this ghost town of a village. Yeah.
TRAVIS: Heads on pikes.

03:50:33.958 --> 03:50:36.440
MATT: He's on this giant throne of softwood furniture.

03:50:36.440 --> 03:50:37.408
(laughter)

03:50:37.408 --> 03:50:39.258
MATT: "I knew you'd come back."

03:50:39.258 --> 03:50:40.091
LAURA: No!

03:50:41.198 --> 03:50:42.711
TRAVIS: I missed that supple wood.

03:50:42.711 --> 03:50:43.808
(laughter)

03:50:43.808 --> 03:50:45.657
MATT: "Y'all need an end table?"

03:50:45.657 --> 03:50:47.390
TRAVIS: (laughs) Ooh.

03:50:47.390 --> 03:50:49.218
MATT: (laughs)

03:50:49.218 --> 03:50:50.659
I mean, he seems forthright, sure.

03:50:50.659 --> 03:50:53.218
LAURA: All right, well I'm going to give him

03:50:53.218 --> 03:50:56.668
an awkward little hug and a pat on the back.

03:50:56.668 --> 03:51:00.618
All right, well maybe we'll see you in Feolinn.

03:51:00.618 --> 03:51:02.284
MATT: "All righty!"
LAURA: Okay.

03:51:02.284 --> 03:51:03.548
MATT: (laughs)

03:51:03.548 --> 03:51:05.446
LAURA: He's weirder than I remember.

03:51:05.446 --> 03:51:06.653
SAM: This is fine.

03:51:06.653 --> 03:51:08.104
ASHLEY: Wait, is he staying here?

03:51:08.104 --> 03:51:10.529
LAURA: No, no, no. He's going to-- he's not staying.

03:51:10.529 --> 03:51:12.537
MATT: He's taking his trek back.
He's just taking this time here.

03:51:12.537 --> 03:51:14.090
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:51:14.090 --> 03:51:15.815
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

03:51:15.815 --> 03:51:18.838
I'm going to send a message to Yussa right now!

03:51:18.838 --> 03:51:22.428
I'm going to use my message
and I'm going to to send a message

03:51:22.428 --> 03:51:27.428
to him saying: Hey, guess who's coming for dinner?

03:51:27.538 --> 03:51:30.781
Your favorite Nein Heroez.

03:51:30.781 --> 03:51:32.061
We'll see you in a minute!

03:51:34.468 --> 03:51:35.979
Oh gosh.

03:51:35.979 --> 03:51:39.678
I missed you so much, Yussa. I can't--

03:51:39.678 --> 03:51:41.743
(laughter)

03:51:41.743 --> 03:51:44.118
TALIESIN: Waste not, want not.

03:51:44.118 --> 03:51:45.218
MATT: The response is,

03:51:45.218 --> 03:51:46.776
"Oh good."

03:51:47.638 --> 03:51:48.574
That's it.

03:51:48.574 --> 03:51:50.218
(laughter)

03:51:50.218 --> 03:51:51.618
LIAM: Definitely on the shitter.
LAURA: Yeah.

03:51:55.587 --> 03:51:56.820
MATT: All right.

03:51:56.820 --> 03:51:59.778
LIAM: All right, well then, is everybody ready?

03:51:59.778 --> 03:52:04.148
TALIESIN: Going to stand next to Fjord
as we get in our circle.

03:52:05.823 --> 03:52:08.726
Someone prayed for a miracle, and there you were.

03:52:08.726 --> 03:52:11.151
Very proud to know you. Well done.

03:52:12.938 --> 03:52:14.559
TRAVIS: Thank you.

03:52:14.559 --> 03:52:15.642
TALIESIN: You did good.

03:52:17.758 --> 03:52:19.191
MARISHA: I stand next to Yasha.

03:52:20.958 --> 03:52:23.158
You never gave your answer last night.

03:52:28.348 --> 03:52:30.323
ASHLEY: Well, I--

03:52:32.298 --> 03:52:34.958
I want to go where you guys go.

03:52:34.958 --> 03:52:39.668
You know, I feel comfortable traveling, you know.

03:52:39.668 --> 03:52:42.978
Like Fjord, I don't really have a home.

03:52:42.978 --> 03:52:44.261
And...

03:52:46.311 --> 03:52:49.448
I'm very curious about these Nine Eyes,

03:52:49.448 --> 03:52:51.540
especially because of Molly and

03:52:53.733 --> 03:52:55.533
the north sounds fun.

03:52:57.998 --> 03:53:01.320
I will follow wherever you guys go.

03:53:03.238 --> 03:53:04.688
MARISHA: Sticking around for a while?

03:53:05.627 --> 03:53:07.964
ASHLEY: Yeah, for sure.

03:53:12.986 --> 03:53:14.098
MARISHA: Let's go.

03:53:14.098 --> 03:53:16.265
LIAM: All right, everyone. Let's go to the beach.

03:53:17.120 --> 03:53:18.848
MARISHA: Go to the beach-beach.

03:53:18.848 --> 03:53:22.318
MATT: As you all step into the arcane sigil,

03:53:23.795 --> 03:53:24.628
one after the other,

03:53:24.628 --> 03:53:27.588
you all find that familiar transitional,

03:53:27.588 --> 03:53:29.258
sucking sensation in your chest

03:53:29.258 --> 03:53:32.638
as you step through onto a darkened stone floor

03:53:32.638 --> 03:53:36.698
in the barely lit interior of Yussa's tower once more.

03:53:36.698 --> 03:53:40.103
There you see Wensforth, the goblin,

03:53:40.103 --> 03:53:43.369
there waiting. Kind of, "Ooh! Oh!"

03:53:43.369 --> 03:53:45.236
Leans back a bit and there, standing you see Yussa,

03:53:45.236 --> 03:53:50.236
arms crossed in his golden, bronze-ish robes,

03:53:50.619 --> 03:53:55.315
bronzed skin with a bit of a cocked head, curious grin.

03:53:55.315 --> 03:53:58.178
"All right, welcome.

03:53:58.178 --> 03:54:00.128
"Are you staying or are you on your way?"

03:54:01.868 --> 03:54:03.608
LIAM: Are you inviting us to stay for a bit?

03:54:03.608 --> 03:54:06.161
MATT: "No, I'm just asking."

03:54:08.378 --> 03:54:11.404
TALIESIN: Passing through.
LIAM: We are passing through--

03:54:11.404 --> 03:54:14.671
LAURA: But we do want to talk to you about some stuff.

03:54:15.525 --> 03:54:16.358
MATT: "All right.

03:54:17.448 --> 03:54:18.758
"What do you wish to ask?"

03:54:18.758 --> 03:54:22.255
TALIESIN: We had a bit of an encounter

03:54:23.918 --> 03:54:25.485
with something from--

03:54:25.485 --> 03:54:26.658
LAURA: The Astral Sea.

03:54:26.658 --> 03:54:28.428
TALIESIN: The Astral Sea.

03:54:28.428 --> 03:54:30.378
Have you ever heard of the Nine Eyes?

03:54:34.215 --> 03:54:35.048
MATT: "I--

03:54:36.437 --> 03:54:38.141
"in what context?"

03:54:38.141 --> 03:54:39.956
LAURA: In any context.

03:54:42.228 --> 03:54:47.228
TALIESIN: We felt the presence of something big and alien,

03:54:47.528 --> 03:54:51.124
and I think it noticed us.

03:54:53.654 --> 03:54:55.070
It was...

03:54:56.907 --> 03:55:00.068
It was terrifying, and

03:55:01.276 --> 03:55:05.943
that's what we have is Nine Eyes. Images of

03:55:08.258 --> 03:55:11.217
bending space and

03:55:13.375 --> 03:55:15.833
bleeding walls and

03:55:18.139 --> 03:55:21.408
things that make no sense.

03:55:21.408 --> 03:55:22.241
The Nine Eyes.

03:55:22.241 --> 03:55:23.968
MATT: "That does indeed sound terrifying.

03:55:23.968 --> 03:55:28.968
"I do not know if I recall anything specific about this."

03:55:31.503 --> 03:55:33.303
TALIESIN: I feel, much like last time,

03:55:33.303 --> 03:55:37.928
it would be something worth looking at it. If it--

03:55:37.928 --> 03:55:38.978
MATT: "I can look into it.

03:55:39.868 --> 03:55:41.968
"Just out of--"
TALIESIN: I would appreciate that.

03:55:41.968 --> 03:55:45.268
MATT: "-- personal curiosity, as such things

03:55:45.268 --> 03:55:50.268
"like you describe: generally, not good.

03:55:50.408 --> 03:55:52.988
"I would like to know about such a thing.

03:55:52.988 --> 03:55:54.968
"Where did you encounter this?"

03:55:54.968 --> 03:55:57.893
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

03:55:57.893 --> 03:56:00.518
We were fighting a creature that

03:56:00.518 --> 03:56:03.236
had set itself up as a god

03:56:03.236 --> 03:56:06.368
on this island that was broken.

03:56:06.368 --> 03:56:08.691
Oh, I don't know, it was

03:56:09.678 --> 03:56:12.310
broken dimensionally, I guess. How would--

03:56:12.310 --> 03:56:16.588
LAURA: Yeah, it seemed like he had busted through,

03:56:16.588 --> 03:56:18.888
like, trying to escape from

03:56:18.888 --> 03:56:23.188
this crazy living city thing in the Astral Sea.

03:56:23.188 --> 03:56:26.803
LIAM: Yeah, he was shunted through to this plane.

03:56:26.803 --> 03:56:29.872
TALIESIN: There were fragments of Water Plane

03:56:29.872 --> 03:56:34.415
and chunks of--
LAURA: So many planes.

03:56:35.715 --> 03:56:39.040
TALIESIN: -- buildings that were torn in half.

03:56:39.040 --> 03:56:40.318
It was very odd.

03:56:40.318 --> 03:56:43.265
MATT: "I will peruse my books and look into this

03:56:43.265 --> 03:56:47.748
"and if I do find anything that matches this

03:56:47.748 --> 03:56:50.431
"Nine Eye-- creature of nine eyes?"

03:56:50.431 --> 03:56:52.178
TALIESIN: I don't even know if it's a creature.

03:56:52.178 --> 03:56:53.831
It's just Nine Eyes.

03:56:54.848 --> 03:56:56.701
MATT: "If I find anything, I'll let you know."

03:56:59.127 --> 03:57:02.530
LAURA: Just send the message. You know the drill.

03:57:02.530 --> 03:57:04.881
MATT: "I'm well aware."

03:57:04.881 --> 03:57:07.438
LAURA: I still have never gotten just a message from you.

03:57:07.438 --> 03:57:10.078
You know, like, you can just send a message

03:57:10.078 --> 03:57:12.948
to say hello, that you miss us.

03:57:12.948 --> 03:57:17.711
MATT: "I'm what you would call not very social.

03:57:18.698 --> 03:57:21.339
"Please don't take it personally.

03:57:21.339 --> 03:57:26.225
"I'm a solitary creature when not having guests arrive

03:57:26.225 --> 03:57:29.948
"so abruptly. I take no offense to it.

03:57:29.948 --> 03:57:32.478
"So I ask you take none from me as well."

03:57:32.478 --> 03:57:33.925
LAURA: None at all.

03:57:34.910 --> 03:57:36.808
MATT: "Wonderful.

03:57:36.808 --> 03:57:39.778
"Well, glad to see that you're safe and sound

03:57:39.778 --> 03:57:42.778
"for the time being,

03:57:42.778 --> 03:57:44.478
"but I was in the middle of something, so."

03:57:44.478 --> 03:57:46.729
SAM: Oh yes. Goodbye!

03:57:46.729 --> 03:57:47.628
LAURA: See ya.

03:57:47.628 --> 03:57:50.060
MATT: And he leads you out of Tide Peak Tower

03:57:50.060 --> 03:57:51.978
back into the streets of Nicodranas.

03:57:51.978 --> 03:57:56.368
A welcoming sense of warm daylight.

03:57:56.368 --> 03:57:59.598
The smell of free ocean air,

03:57:59.598 --> 03:58:03.488
distinctly different from that on the shores of Rumblecusp,

03:58:03.488 --> 03:58:06.671
as well as the spices and

03:58:06.671 --> 03:58:09.638
various odd and interesting scents

03:58:09.638 --> 03:58:12.718
that come across the warm beach side wind.

03:58:12.718 --> 03:58:15.605
You hear the gulls cawing overhead,

03:58:15.605 --> 03:58:17.989
the bells of ships in the harbor,

03:58:17.989 --> 03:58:21.697
and the scuffing of foot and boot prints
across the streets surrounding you.

03:58:21.697 --> 03:58:24.808
and the scuffing of foot and boot prints
across the streets surrounding you.

03:58:24.808 --> 03:58:27.152
Welcome back to Nicodranas.

03:58:27.152 --> 03:58:28.440
That's where we'll pick up next week.

03:58:28.440 --> 03:58:32.177
MARISHA: Feels good. Feels good!
TRAVIS: Yeah! Yeah!

03:58:32.177 --> 03:58:34.418
MATT: And, also

03:58:34.418 --> 03:58:36.909
♪ finishing the Rumblecusp arc and Traveler Con ♪

03:58:36.909 --> 03:58:38.515
♪ puts you all at level 13. ♪

03:58:38.515 --> 03:58:40.882
(cheering)

03:58:42.268 --> 03:58:43.488
SAM: Do we roll?

03:58:43.488 --> 03:58:44.828
MATT: Yeah, we're going to roll some hit points.

03:58:44.828 --> 03:58:46.595
LAURA: Oh my god.
SAM: Level 13, what does that do?

03:58:46.595 --> 03:58:50.438
MATT: Unless you still have
any multiclassing stuff to decide.

03:58:50.438 --> 03:58:51.271
LIAM: Fuck no.

03:58:51.271 --> 03:58:54.411
LAURA: Beau, the-- Marisha. The money you got?

03:58:54.411 --> 03:58:55.253
MARISHA: Oh yeah!

03:58:55.253 --> 03:58:57.908
LAURA: I took off the 112 gold that we each took off

03:58:57.908 --> 03:59:00.960
so that we could give money to the villagers.

03:59:00.960 --> 03:59:04.518
You're left with 93 copper, 800 silver,

03:59:04.518 --> 03:59:08.184
2,688 gold,

03:59:08.184 --> 03:59:11.368
and 185 platinum.

03:59:11.368 --> 03:59:13.498
MARISHA: Platinum, give that one more time.

03:59:13.498 --> 03:59:15.258
LAURA: 185.

03:59:15.258 --> 03:59:18.732
MARISHA: 85 platinum.

03:59:18.732 --> 03:59:20.623
SAM: 185 platinum?

03:59:21.928 --> 03:59:24.015
MATT: All right. Who wants to roll some hit points?

03:59:24.015 --> 03:59:24.848
TALIESIN: I'm ready.

03:59:24.848 --> 03:59:26.723
MATT: All right, go ahead, Taliesin.
TALIESIN: d8, right?

03:59:26.723 --> 03:59:27.556
MATT: d8.

03:59:28.448 --> 03:59:29.281
TALIESIN: Five.

03:59:29.281 --> 03:59:30.421
MATT: Five, nice!

03:59:31.688 --> 03:59:34.228
Go ahead and add that. Beauregard?

03:59:34.228 --> 03:59:36.098
MARISHA: Ooh, seven!

03:59:36.098 --> 03:59:37.338
MATT: Good, well done.

03:59:37.338 --> 03:59:38.918
MARISHA: Yeah!

03:59:38.918 --> 03:59:39.751
MATT: All right.

03:59:43.215 --> 03:59:44.048
ASHLEY: Two.

03:59:44.048 --> 03:59:46.479
MATT: Aw! Well, you were bound to make a shitty roll

03:59:46.479 --> 03:59:47.988
at some point. You've had some good hit point rolls.

03:59:47.988 --> 03:59:49.968
ASHLEY: Yeah, I have some good hit points.

03:59:49.968 --> 03:59:51.469
SAM: Eight from a d8 for me, yeah?

03:59:51.469 --> 03:59:53.098
MATT: For a d8, yeah.

03:59:53.098 --> 03:59:55.100
SAM: One.
MATT: No, reroll ones.

03:59:56.268 --> 03:59:57.101
SAM: Three!

03:59:57.101 --> 03:59:58.778
MATT: Hey, it's better than one.

03:59:58.778 --> 04:00:00.711
LIAM: Come on, big three.

04:00:00.711 --> 04:00:01.658
Five.

04:00:01.658 --> 04:00:03.321
MATT: Oh, look at you!

04:00:03.321 --> 04:00:04.329
TRAVIS: Big spender!

04:00:04.329 --> 04:00:05.838
MARISHA: Big wizard!

04:00:05.838 --> 04:00:07.196
Yeah!
MATT: Hell yeah!

04:00:07.196 --> 04:00:08.875
LIAM: I'm over 80, guys.

04:00:08.875 --> 04:00:11.518
(laughter)

04:00:11.518 --> 04:00:13.334
TALIESIN: What's with all these 7th-level spells?

04:00:13.334 --> 04:00:14.167
LAURA: Three.

04:00:14.167 --> 04:00:15.548
MATT: Three?
LIAM: Yeah, man.

04:00:15.548 --> 04:00:18.298
TRAVIS: I'll take my third level in paladin.

04:00:18.298 --> 04:00:20.728
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Let's see some 7th-level spells.

04:00:20.728 --> 04:00:21.818
TRAVIS: Nine.

04:00:21.818 --> 04:00:22.735
MATT: Nine!

04:00:22.735 --> 04:00:24.088
TRAVIS: Very nice.

04:00:24.088 --> 04:00:24.921
MATT: Well done.

04:00:25.988 --> 04:00:27.131
All right.

04:00:27.131 --> 04:00:30.538
MARISHA: Oh my goodness, okay.
LIAM: Oh my goodness. So many good-

04:00:30.538 --> 04:00:32.938
TRAVIS: So you put it in modifier?

04:00:32.938 --> 04:00:36.518
LAURA: Put Edit, Manage Levels.
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

04:00:36.518 --> 04:00:38.508
MATT: Indeed, so now at 13th level,

04:00:38.508 --> 04:00:40.996
many of you have access to 7th-level spells.

04:00:40.996 --> 04:00:42.113
TALIESIN: Yep.
LIAM: Yeah!

04:00:42.113 --> 04:00:44.603
LAURA: Yeah, you add however much you rolled hit points.

04:00:44.603 --> 04:00:46.438
MARISHA: Oh my gosh!

04:00:46.438 --> 04:00:48.451
I'm so excited for everybody!

04:00:49.558 --> 04:00:50.773
Yeah.
MATT: That's going to be fun.

04:00:50.773 --> 04:00:51.606
LIAM: Yeah.

04:00:51.606 --> 04:00:53.501
MARISHA: Real shit starts-- I don't real mean shit.

04:00:53.501 --> 04:00:54.868
TALIESIN: Oh, there's some insane shit in here.

04:00:54.868 --> 04:00:56.868
MATT and MARISHA: Yeah.

04:00:56.868 --> 04:01:00.918
TRAVIS: So I'll have to get back to you on which oath.

04:01:00.918 --> 04:01:01.751
MATT: Yeah, we'll talk.

04:01:01.751 --> 04:01:02.778
TRAVIS: Okay.
MATT: We'll talk.

04:01:03.808 --> 04:01:05.358
All righty, with hit points rolled,

04:01:05.358 --> 04:01:07.398
you all get to decide until next session

04:01:07.398 --> 04:01:10.395
all the rest of your leveling capabilities.

04:01:10.395 --> 04:01:14.208
We'll pick up next session
fresh on the streets of Nicodranas,

04:01:14.208 --> 04:01:17.158
post-Traveler Con into whatever
the next wave of future and adventure

04:01:17.158 --> 04:01:20.591
post-Traveler Con into whatever
the next wave of future and adventure

04:01:20.591 --> 04:01:23.266
The Mighty Nein finds itself wandering towards.

04:01:23.266 --> 04:01:24.257
Thank you all for joining us.

04:01:24.257 --> 04:01:25.238
Have a wonderful night.

04:01:25.238 --> 04:01:27.215
We love you very much, and

04:01:27.215 --> 04:01:28.709
is it Thursday yet? Good night.

04:01:28.709 --> 04:01:30.125
TRAVIS: Oh man!

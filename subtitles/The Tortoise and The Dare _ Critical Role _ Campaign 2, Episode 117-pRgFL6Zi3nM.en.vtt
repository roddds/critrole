MATT: Hello, everyone,

00:00:01.183 --> 00:00:02.700
and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role,

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.460
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:05.856
and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:05.856 --> 00:00:08.548
ALL: (discordant shouting)

00:00:09.856 --> 00:00:11.080
(laughter)

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.240
Before we start tonight's game,

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.630
we do have some announcements to get through.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.110
Beginning with our first of two sponsors tonight,

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:18.130
D&amp;D Beyond.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.360
Sam.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.370
SAM: Guys you may have noticed that

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.450
I haven't done a D&amp;D Beyond ad in quite some time.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.820
Now, they haven't said anything about it,

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.430
but I think it's because I'm on some sort of probation.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.830
Maybe it was all the Scottish accents,

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.350
maybe it was the fart jokes,

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.570
maybe there weren't enough fart jokes, I don't know.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.790
But clearly I'm on some sort of probation.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.500
So tonight, I'm going to do everything by the book.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.400
Nothing crass, nothing silly,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.550
just the advertising words as written.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.910
And to keep me on track, Ashley over here has volunteered.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.060
Ash?
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.720
SAM: Do not let me stray from the script.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.420
ASHLEY: No no no, I got you, you're good.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.990
SAM: Okay this episode is sponsored
by our friends D&amp;D Beyond,

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.270
and the new Tasha's Cauldron of Everything.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.664
The most ambitious, biggest expansion source book in years.

00:01:02.664 --> 00:01:04.362
You know what is funny, when I'm at home,

00:01:04.362 --> 00:01:07.700
my biggest expansion is something a little less literary--

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.230
ASHLEY: Sam, no, no, no!

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.677
SAM: Oh, thank you, thank you, Ashley, yes, you're right.

00:01:11.677 --> 00:01:12.510
Okay.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.660
Players can experiment with character builds

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.140
by using 22 new subclasses.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.370
While DMs can liven up their campaigns

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.240
with an expanded toolkit, puzzle guides,

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.860
and unnatural environments like magic storms.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:24.693
You know what,

00:01:24.693 --> 00:01:27.683
magic storms sounds like a hip R&amp;B album.

00:01:27.683 --> 00:01:31.220
♪ Ooh, magic storms, keep you warm, oh good... ♪

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.895
ASHLEY: (clicks training clicker) Hey, no.

00:01:32.895 --> 00:01:34.210
(laughter)

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.200
Shush!

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.475
Sit down.

00:01:36.475 --> 00:01:38.100
SAM: (dog whimpering)

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.460
Good boy.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.540
SAM: Okay.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.877
The digital collection on the D&amp;D Beyond makes it easy to

00:01:43.877 --> 00:01:45.040
include Tasha's content

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.070
in your character sheet and campaign,

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.500
and master tier subscribers can share the book

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.940
with everyone in their campaign for free,

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.724
and speaking of free...
ASHLEY: Hey.

00:01:54.724 --> 00:01:56.119
(laughter)

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.010
SAM: Oh! Oh!
(laughter)

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.140
ASHLEY: No!
(laughter)

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.053
No!
(laughter)

00:02:04.748 --> 00:02:05.657
Off.

00:02:05.657 --> 00:02:06.656
SAM: (growling bark)

00:02:06.656 --> 00:02:11.360
Okay, D&amp;D Beyond is extending their pre-order perks

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.776
to anyone who picks up a copy of Tasha's--

00:02:13.776 --> 00:02:15.018
(laughter)

00:02:15.018 --> 00:02:18.140
SAM: -- before Tuesday, November 24, 2020.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.130
And this includes

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.980
11 exclusive character sheet backdrops and frames

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.250
plus a limited edition Cauldron Digital Dice Set.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.307
ASHLEY: Don't do it.

00:02:27.307 --> 00:02:30.497
(laughter)

00:02:30.497 --> 00:02:32.129
SAM: (shouting Irish accent) Top of the morning to...

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:33.313
ASHLEY: No!
(laughter)

00:02:33.313 --> 00:02:35.654
SAM: Okay, okay, okay, that's it.
ASHLEY: Bad dog!

00:02:36.685 --> 00:02:37.860
SAM: Check it all out now--

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.001
(laughter)

00:02:39.001 --> 00:02:43.602
Check it all out now at bit.ly/CRTashas and thanks to them

00:02:43.602 --> 00:02:45.755
for continuing to support the show.

00:02:45.755 --> 00:02:47.435
(snarls, barks)

00:02:47.435 --> 00:02:50.458
(laughter)
(clicker clicks)

00:02:50.458 --> 00:02:51.895
MATT: Okay.
ASHLEY: It's so loud.

00:02:51.895 --> 00:02:53.903
(laughter)

00:02:53.903 --> 00:02:56.104
MATT: All right, thank you, Sam, thank you, Ashley,

00:02:56.104 --> 00:02:57.774
and thank you, D&amp;D Beyond.

00:02:57.774 --> 00:03:00.882
(laughter)

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:06.332
Live recording, you never know.

00:03:06.332 --> 00:03:07.400
TRAVIS: Good.
MATT: Yeah.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.361
So our second sponsor is Dungeon Craft.

00:03:11.361 --> 00:03:13.523
So for those who aren't familiar,

00:03:13.523 --> 00:03:15.540
our friends at Dungeon Craft sponsored tonight's episode

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.850
for their Hell &amp; High Water 2D terrain box.

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.910
LAURA: Did you say tooty?
MATT: Yep, 2D.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.940
Like "two dee," not "tooty."

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.150
You can if you want to, I guess, don't let me...

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.983
TRAVIS: Hold your farts in?

00:03:26.983 --> 00:03:30.125
MATT: Yeah, well, that, I don't want to limit your fun.

00:03:30.125 --> 00:03:31.713
But for any fantasy RPG,

00:03:31.713 --> 00:03:33.660
comes with hundreds of terrain pieces,

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:34.870
all of which are double-sided

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.710
with multiple different ways to utilize them,

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:40.410
they're water resistant, for wet and dry writing and erasing

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.640
and a one inch grid on it

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.120
so each piece can slide into place on any map.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.277
So between the two books

00:03:45.277 --> 00:03:48.228
there are nearly 2000 pieces for you to utilize,

00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:50.070
all of which cover different locations, such as cities,

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.870
wilderness, dungeon, hellscape, and seafaring terrain.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.300
They have a bunch of great Black Friday deals

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.260
going on right now

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.870
so check it out at bit.ly,

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.742
that's bit.ly/1985games2.

00:04:02.742 --> 00:04:05.940
And if you use the code "criticalpin" when you check out,

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.770
they'll throw in a free tape mimic pin with your order,

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.290
so go check it out.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.323
This is really freaking awesome.

00:04:13.221 --> 00:04:14.410
SAM: It looks cool.

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.520
MATT: I've been using tiles and
stuff at home, but this is...

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.296
If I had this back in the day,
SAM: Yeah.

00:04:19.296 --> 00:04:21.462
MATT: I would have been so much happier.

00:04:21.462 --> 00:04:23.170
TALIESIN: I think I have one of those pins.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:24.320
MATT: Fantastic!

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.004
MARISHA: Is that the pin?
MATT: Oh, I have it.

00:04:26.004 --> 00:04:28.145
MARISHA: I want a pin.
MATT: Here it is. There is the pin.

00:04:28.145 --> 00:04:30.137
MARISHA: Are these the pins? (gasps)

00:04:30.137 --> 00:04:32.179
MATT: We all got 'em!
LAURA: What? I don't have one!

00:04:32.179 --> 00:04:33.375
MARISHA: These are so cool.
TALIESIN: Oh, you might.

00:04:33.375 --> 00:04:34.830
You have so much stuff on your desk.

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.391
MARISHA: It's true, it's hiding somewhere.
LAURA: I do.

00:04:37.391 --> 00:04:39.638
LIAM: If only you had some merch.

00:04:39.638 --> 00:04:41.872
LAURA: We'll get to it, we'll get to it.

00:04:41.872 --> 00:04:44.340
MATT: Well, once again, Hell &amp; High Water, awesome.

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.036
Thank you, guys. Go check them out.

00:04:47.036 --> 00:04:48.880
Marisha, you have an announcement.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.030
MARISHA: Yes.
SAM: Oh.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.010
MARISHA: As a reminder, next Thursday

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.520
Critical Role will be dark,

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.770
as we are celebrating Thanksgiving

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.721
here in the United States.

00:04:58.721 --> 00:05:00.247
That's November 26th.

00:05:00.247 --> 00:05:05.030
We will be back for episode 118 on Thursday, December 3rd.

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.990
So we'll see you in December.

00:05:08.204 --> 00:05:09.145
Yeah.

00:05:09.145 --> 00:05:11.774
Last month of the year.
LAURA: That's crazy.

00:05:11.774 --> 00:05:13.583
SAM: ♪ Wake me up ♪

00:05:13.583 --> 00:05:15.790
MARISHA: ♪ When December comes ♪

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:16.980
SAM: Very good.
MATT: All right.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.435
TRAVIS: Whoa, whoa.
SAM: Best radio ever.

00:05:18.435 --> 00:05:20.518
(laughter)

00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:23.830
MATT: Also wanted to let you guys know that our

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.790
Vox Machina: Origins library edition book

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.280
from our friends at Dark Horse

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.970
releases next Tuesday, November 4th.

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.511
This is the mighty tome here.
TRAVIS: Whoa, what?

00:05:33.511 --> 00:05:34.771
MATT: This is a sizeable tome.

00:05:34.771 --> 00:05:37.220
LAURA: How come none of us have seen that?
TRAVIS: Why do you hide shit until the show starts?

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.479
MATT: Because that's what I'm supposed to do.

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:39.512
(clamoring)
MATT: Look at that.

00:05:39.512 --> 00:05:42.208
It's a big old book, it's a big old book.

00:05:42.208 --> 00:05:44.182
TALIESIN: No.
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

00:05:44.182 --> 00:05:45.851
MATT: So this is all the collected issues

00:05:45.851 --> 00:05:48.050
of Vox Machina Origins series one and series two

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.978
in one epic volume,

00:05:49.978 --> 00:05:52.775
with cover art by the amazing Hunter Severn Bonyun.

00:05:52.775 --> 00:05:55.092
I probably ruined that name, I'm really sorry if I did.

00:05:55.092 --> 00:05:57.570
The volume also contains never before seen art and sketches

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.987
plus a forward written by Gail Simone herself.

00:05:59.987 --> 00:06:01.700
(cheers)

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.062
Recently converted Critter,

00:06:03.062 --> 00:06:05.947
and person we are all big fans of for a very long time.

00:06:05.947 --> 00:06:07.856
You can check out the incredible creative team

00:06:07.856 --> 00:06:10.160
that put work into this collection through our article

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.352
at critrole.com that showcases all the offerings

00:06:13.352 --> 00:06:14.243
with Dark Horse.

00:06:14.243 --> 00:06:17.866
And this will available in our US, UK, and Australian stores

00:06:17.866 --> 00:06:19.160
when it releases on Tuesday

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.860
or you can pre-order it right now through

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.840
your local comic and book retailers.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.399
LAURA: Look at all them Grog-y abs.

00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:25.430
MATT: I know.
LIAM: Yeah, yeah.

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.050
(washboard sounds)

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.818
LIAM: Thick slab of comics.
TRAVIS: (as Grog) It's a low-carb diet.

00:06:29.818 --> 00:06:32.202
(laughter)

00:06:32.202 --> 00:06:33.230
MATT: Laura, you got some things to talk about.

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:34.805
LAURA: Oh, I'm talking about it now?

00:06:34.805 --> 00:06:36.210
MATT: Yeah.
TRAVIS: It's happening.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.053
LAURA: Guess what we've got, you guys?

00:06:38.053 --> 00:06:40.400
We've got some merch up.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.374
I should tell you though, here's the thing,

00:06:43.374 --> 00:06:45.728
you guys know that we pre-record these episodes.

00:06:45.728 --> 00:06:48.267
So if I'm talking about an item,

00:06:48.267 --> 00:06:53.050
and it happens to be sold out, I apologize in advance.

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.990
Because I'm really excited about this one.

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.590
LIAM: Oh!
TRAVIS: Oh, boy.

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:00.380
LAURA: Okay, so you probably can't tell

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:01.620
just from this box what it is,

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.554
but look at this fucking box, okay.

00:07:05.554 --> 00:07:07.070
I'm going to open it.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.852
MARISHA: Give it, give it.
SAM: Whoa, the box is so cool.

00:07:09.852 --> 00:07:11.330
LAURA: (happy yell)

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.261
MARISHA: Yeah, it's so cute.
LAURA: The box is so cool,

00:07:13.261 --> 00:07:15.232
but even cooler--
SAM: Plush.

00:07:15.232 --> 00:07:17.000
LAURA: -- is this plushie-plushie--
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.200
ASHLEY: I'm going to be living in that.
LAURA: Hold on.

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.774
MATT: Same, same.
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah.

00:07:19.774 --> 00:07:21.060
LAURA: Gilmore's Glorious--
SAM: Does it have a hood?

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:22.695
MARISHA: Oh my god.
SAM: Does it have a hood?

00:07:22.695 --> 00:07:25.485
LAURA: It has a hood!
SAM: (admiringly) Oh.

00:07:25.485 --> 00:07:27.248
LAURA: It's so soft.
TRAVIS: It's real soft.

00:07:27.248 --> 00:07:31.640
LAURA: I've had it at home for a long time,

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.234
and I wear it all the time.

00:07:33.234 --> 00:07:35.860
And I'm sorry to all of you that I got the prototype--

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.756
MATT: You hoarding bitch.
LAURA: -- in advance.

00:07:37.756 --> 00:07:40.738
MARISHA: I know! Jelly, Laura.

00:07:40.738 --> 00:07:43.093
LAURA: It's so soft.
MARISHA: Share your prototypes.

00:07:43.093 --> 00:07:45.880
LIAM: We just make pandemic wear now.

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.538
LAURA: Okay, can you hold this now?

00:07:47.538 --> 00:07:51.307
Because I've got other things to talk about, okay.

00:07:51.307 --> 00:07:52.805
There's not a lot of room here.

00:07:52.805 --> 00:07:57.360
But there's more to talk about, so there we go.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.970
Okay, also we have some holiday items

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:02.290
showing up in the shop.

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:04.100
So I'm going to talk about them.

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:08.590
You may have noticed these popping up in some of the stores.

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:10.210
SAM: Oh, excuse me.
LAURA: I know.

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:13.480
So they're our Critical Role ornaments.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.810
Oh, I'm fucking up the box.
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah.

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:17.693
LAURA: There's Vox Machina.
MATT: That's awesome.

00:08:17.693 --> 00:08:21.460
There's Mighty Nein and our logo.

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:22.373
TRAVIS: Are they metal?

00:08:22.373 --> 00:08:24.423
LAURA: They're metal, they're great.

00:08:24.423 --> 00:08:25.394
Okay, so that's there.

00:08:25.394 --> 00:08:26.377
(laughter)

00:08:26.377 --> 00:08:31.377
Hold on, and then also we have wrapping paper

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.310
designed by Grace Berríos.

00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:36.209
We have three different color combinations. We have purple--

00:08:36.209 --> 00:08:37.967
TALIESIN: Wow.
LAURA: -- and yellow.

00:08:38.927 --> 00:08:39.760
TRAVIS: Dude, it's so intricate...

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:44.118
LAURA: We have blue and goldies.
ASHLEY: It's so pretty in purple.

00:08:44.118 --> 00:08:49.118
LAURA: And we also have extra fancy dark green and silver.

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:51.070
TRAVIS: It's got like metallic pearl.

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:54.706
LAURA: Yeah, and this one has like metallic stuff on it.

00:08:54.706 --> 00:08:57.373
So yeah, we have wrapping paper, but also

00:08:57.373 --> 00:08:59.905
what kind of wrapping paper isn't complete

00:08:59.905 --> 00:09:02.210
without washi tape to go with them?

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:03.436
(laughter)

00:09:03.436 --> 00:09:05.344
MATT: Oh my god.
ASHLEY: What!

00:09:05.344 --> 00:09:06.762
SAM: What is that?
LAURA: It's washi tape.

00:09:06.762 --> 00:09:08.893
SAM: What is wash--?
LAURA: It's fancy.

00:09:08.893 --> 00:09:10.762
ASHLEY: I didn't know we were making washi tape.

00:09:10.762 --> 00:09:11.595
LAURA: Right?

00:09:11.595 --> 00:09:13.460
So I'm a big fan of gift wrap,

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:14.700
so this is why this is happening.

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:18.010
But we have different color combinations of the tape,

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:21.408
so it goes with the wrapping paper, so yeah.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.562
TRAVIS: At our house gift-wrapping is real serious.

00:09:23.562 --> 00:09:24.950
LAURA: I think they're in the stores now--
MATT: I can tell.

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:26.510
LAURA: -- if they're not, just keep an eye on them

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:29.627
because they'll be popping up very soon, so yeah.

00:09:29.627 --> 00:09:32.480
TRAVIS: I hand Laura a present during
the holidays and she's like,

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.906
"Nice sharp corners."

00:09:33.906 --> 00:09:35.501
(laughter)

00:09:35.501 --> 00:09:37.403
TRAVIS: I'm like, all right.

00:09:37.403 --> 00:09:38.711
(laughter)

00:09:38.711 --> 00:09:41.977
ASHLEY: Your gifts are always wrapped the best.

00:09:41.977 --> 00:09:43.620
You always have very intricate...

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:45.270
LAURA: There is an art to the sharp corners

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:47.390
I'm not going to lie, yeah.

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:48.470
MATT: My wrapping job always looks like

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:50.356
some sort of seaside deli. It's...

00:09:50.356 --> 00:09:52.114
(laughter)

00:09:52.114 --> 00:09:53.390
Here.
TALIESIN: I got you a sandwich.

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:54.734
MATT: Yeah, it's bad, it's bad.

00:09:54.734 --> 00:09:57.499
MARISHA: I just do it, yeah.

00:09:57.499 --> 00:09:58.944
SAM: You do bags?

00:09:58.944 --> 00:10:00.556
MARISHA: No, I just do all the wrapping.

00:10:00.556 --> 00:10:02.104
SAM: Oh, you do all the wrapping.

00:10:02.104 --> 00:10:04.173
LAURA: That's everything I've got right now, I think.

00:10:04.173 --> 00:10:05.890
TALIESIN: It's fresh because it's yesterday's newspaper.

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:07.510
MATT: Damn, Laura.
SAM: That's amazing stuff, Laura.

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:09.826
MATT: Yeah, you've been busy.
LAURA: Yeah.

00:10:09.826 --> 00:10:13.630
MATT: I need that robe, I mean--
(as Gilmore) for obvious reasons.

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.280
All right, so anyway,

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:17.790
I believe that's the end of our announcements tonight.

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:20.010
So let's go ahead and jump into

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:23.033
tonight's episode of Critical Role.

00:10:23.033 --> 00:10:25.612
(clamoring)

00:10:25.612 --> 00:10:27.463
(water bubbling)

00:10:27.463 --> 00:10:29.782
(thunder rumbling)

MATT: And welcome back.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.530
Before we begin, I must have said the date wrong,

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:08.435
because my brain, November 24th, if I got it wrong,

00:12:08.435 --> 00:12:10.233
is when this comes out, so otherwise,

00:12:10.233 --> 00:12:11.634
we'd be going back in time.

00:12:11.634 --> 00:12:14.815
But yeah, so, correction, sorry.

00:12:14.815 --> 00:12:16.870
Set that there.

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:18.365
LAURA: Get it right, Matt.

00:12:18.365 --> 00:12:21.955
MATT: I did!
ASHLEY: Boo!

00:12:21.955 --> 00:12:23.800
MATT: All righty, so.

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.532
TRAVIS: We're good, we're good, we're good, we're good.

00:12:25.532 --> 00:12:27.510
SAM: Oh shit.
TRAVIS: We're good, we're good.

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:31.060
MATT: Last we left off: The Mighty Nein, making their way

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:35.700
to Eiselcross, lost their paid patron for this trip,

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:38.573
Lady Vess DeRogna, as she was murdered, it seems,

00:12:38.573 --> 00:12:43.180
by Mollymauk, or whoever pilots the body.

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:44.870
You've gathered the body of Vess,

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:48.197
and made your way northward
with your guide, Day-gen Underthorn,

00:12:48.197 --> 00:12:50.980
or Dagen Underthorn, or however pronunciation

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:53.520
we've decided to do over the past few weeks,

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:54.861
he--
TALIESIN: Purvon.

00:12:54.861 --> 00:12:58.319
MATT: Right, Purvon. Is your guide northward.

00:12:58.319 --> 00:13:00.810
After coming across a number of dangerous

00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:05.810
and unique encounters in this southern region of Foren.

00:13:06.434 --> 00:13:08.665
You eventually found your way to A5,

00:13:08.665 --> 00:13:12.268
the first of your Aeorian ruin excavations.

00:13:12.268 --> 00:13:15.866
You delved into the subterranean tunnels beneath,

00:13:15.866 --> 00:13:18.020
you searched for signs of life,

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:20.780
signs of recent movement, uncovered bodies,

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:23.268
some older, some newer.

00:13:23.268 --> 00:13:25.730
A still spider creature that you avoided

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:28.480
and sealed off, mostly.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.550
You fought frozen elementals in a chamber,

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:35.550
and one of you, Veth, slid through the open doors

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:38.640
upon completing the puzzle of which led to the next chamber,

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.941
which was a 270-foot pit,

00:13:40.941 --> 00:13:44.470
and you plummeted, but caught yourself

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:47.409
with some magical know how,

00:13:47.409 --> 00:13:49.860
and then were immediately attacked by some black puddings

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.991
that drew your attention.

00:13:51.991 --> 00:13:54.489
The rest of you turned into, some of you turned into eagles,

00:13:54.489 --> 00:13:56.010
and others rode on them,

00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:59.508
and you fought them in a giant lightless tunnel... D&amp;D!

00:13:59.508 --> 00:14:01.560
(laughter)

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:04.268
After making you way to the base of that pit--
(offscreen sneeze)

00:14:04.268 --> 00:14:05.693
MATT: Bless you.
LIAM: <i>Gesund</i>.

00:14:05.693 --> 00:14:10.377
MATT: You discovered the hidden, mostly obscured entranceway

00:14:10.377 --> 00:14:15.292
to an elongated, still magically lit tunnel.

00:14:15.292 --> 00:14:19.699
At the end of it, an arcane doorway, and beyond that,

00:14:19.699 --> 00:14:23.704
a somewhat circular chamber, whereupon looking within,

00:14:23.704 --> 00:14:26.637
you discovered the tail end of a conflict,

00:14:26.637 --> 00:14:30.560
where it seems the Tomb Takers had just finished off

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:34.368
the last of their victims.

00:14:34.368 --> 00:14:37.937
Of which Mollymauk, throwing the lifeless body of the

00:14:37.937 --> 00:14:40.300
individual he was previously clutching to the ground,

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:43.502
turned with a smile and said,

00:14:43.502 --> 00:14:46.623
(Irish accent) "Oh, my apologies, you arrived early.

00:14:46.623 --> 00:14:49.350
"I was hoping to tidy up a bit."

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:52.698
So that's where we begin.

00:14:52.698 --> 00:14:56.890
As you see the Tomb Takers all begin to stand still

00:14:56.890 --> 00:15:01.630
out and about in the center, semi-circular lower region

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:04.123
of this somewhat rounded chamber.

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:07.770
Corpses strewn about in the space around them,

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:11.143
pools of blood, the bright blue, vibrant light

00:15:11.143 --> 00:15:15.041
illuminating the entire chamber with this blue hue,

00:15:15.041 --> 00:15:18.705
this strange blue stone set into the ceiling

00:15:18.705 --> 00:15:22.040
as these carved sigils all drag their way across the floor

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.550
with the back wall up into

00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:26.550
where this stone is currently affixed.

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:31.260
You stand above where the doors open, and

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:35.360
the upper tier balconies that eventually lead to stairs

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:36.800
that curve downward, or a set of stairs

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.450
that directly enters the chamber.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.790
What do you do?

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:43.910
TRAVIS: Quick description question.

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:45.519
The jewel in the center of the room.

00:15:45.519 --> 00:15:46.811
MATT: Yep.

00:15:46.811 --> 00:15:48.870
TRAVIS: Again, how big is it?

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:51.868
MATT: It's roughly a foot and a half to two feet

00:15:51.868 --> 00:15:53.616
from side to side.

00:15:53.616 --> 00:15:55.160
So it's a sizeable stone.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:56.230
TRAVIS: And it's in the ceiling?

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:58.579
MATT: It's in the ceiling.
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:15:58.579 --> 00:16:02.959
LIAM: There's sigilwork all around the room, you said?

00:16:02.959 --> 00:16:04.421
MATT: It's in the center of the chamber.

00:16:04.421 --> 00:16:06.550
There's scrolling all throughout,

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:08.240
and there's bits of rock and rubble,

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.940
and the room has seen better days,

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:12.100
but it is fairly decently preserved

00:16:12.100 --> 00:16:14.147
in comparison to other chambers you've come across

00:16:14.147 --> 00:16:16.522
within these ruins.

00:16:16.522 --> 00:16:20.560
But the central symbols lie on the floor

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.610
in the center of the chamber, and then continue on

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:25.150
to the opposite side from where you're standing,

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:27.795
up the wall, and then surround the stone above.

00:16:27.795 --> 00:16:31.543
LIAM: And how far are we from our old friend?

00:16:31.543 --> 00:16:35.950
MATT: At this moment, I'd say roughly 40, 45 feet.

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:36.783
LIAM: That's close.

00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:39.143
MATT: It's not a massive chamber.

00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:44.450
LAURA: What kind of clothes is Lucien wearing?

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:46.381
MATT: Right now, you can see,

00:16:46.381 --> 00:16:48.026
while they're in various different shades

00:16:48.026 --> 00:16:50.854
and stylings per se, they're all wearing

00:16:50.854 --> 00:16:54.823
their heavy winter furs and leathers and cloaks.

00:16:56.471 --> 00:16:59.350
He's wearing heavy leather pants with

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:00.800
fur-trimmed boots.

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:01.810
It looks like, beneath the coat,

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:03.415
which is currently open now,

00:17:03.415 --> 00:17:07.952
he has a simple silk or white cloth shirt

00:17:07.952 --> 00:17:10.994
he has a simple silk or white cloth shirt

00:17:10.994 --> 00:17:13.230
beneath that billows a bit, you can see.

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:15.310
It's not unlike something maybe you've seen Molly wear

00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:16.893
beneath his outfit.

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:20.490
LIAM: And when we were walking in,

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:22.540
he was just finishing murdering a fool, right?

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:23.500
MATT: Correct.

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.890
Now, you all, for the most part, are still in the hallway.

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:29.090
It was Caleb who noticed this originally,

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:30.940
as you were the last one to open the door,

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:31.890
if I recall.

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:33.100
LIAM: Yeah, that's true.

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:35.340
LIAM: So you would've dumped...
LAURA: Moved the body.

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:38.461
LIAM: Yeah, I just used my foot to push

00:17:38.461 --> 00:17:42.461
Vess' body a little out of the way, pathetically.

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:51.488
I hope we're not being too presumptuous to intrude.

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:55.480
MATT: "Well, I mean, we're not in the middle

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:58.093
"of anything right now, necessarily, so,

00:17:59.447 --> 00:18:01.943
"please, come in."

00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:05.830
LAURA: Are you going to attack us if we do?

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:09.214
LIAM: We're all friends here.
MATT: "Not unless you give us a reason to."

00:18:11.817 --> 00:18:14.050
LAURA: I-I-Insight check?

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:16.010
MATT: Make an insight check.

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:17.411
TRAVIS: 45-foot insight check.

00:18:17.411 --> 00:18:19.269
(laughter)

00:18:21.228 --> 00:18:22.260
LAURA: 17.

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.410
MATT: 17. This is a tense situation.

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:26.243
LAURA: Yeah!

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.194
MATT: And it could go either way.

00:18:29.194 --> 00:18:30.436
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: Who knows?

00:18:30.436 --> 00:18:31.847
TRAVIS: Well, that's fair.

00:18:31.847 --> 00:18:35.265
TALIESIN: I, for one, am embracing the awkward, so...

00:18:35.265 --> 00:18:40.131
LIAM: This is a very tricky circumstance...

00:18:41.431 --> 00:18:42.797
you.

00:18:44.404 --> 00:18:47.690
MATT: You see he's holding two different,

00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:50.200
unfamiliar scimitars in his hands

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.650
as he picks them up off the ground.

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:54.242
The one that he had dropped
when he clutched the other person

00:18:54.242 --> 00:18:56.230
and wipes it on the edge of his cloak.

00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:57.455
TRAVIS: Unfamiliar scimitars?

00:18:57.455 --> 00:18:58.288
MATT: Correct.

00:19:00.301 --> 00:19:02.986
TALIESIN: We haven't met.

00:19:02.986 --> 00:19:06.390
MATT: "In fact, I think I've only met you.

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:09.188
"Well, sort of met, at a distance, at least.

00:19:09.188 --> 00:19:12.413
"I'm a bit curious who you are."

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:14.900
LAURA: Right.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.330
I was wondering if you remembered.

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:19.923
MATT: "Well, I think..."
MARISHA: We're just a

00:19:19.923 --> 00:19:22.380
blast from your past, I guess.

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:24.310
MATT: Looks over towards Cree, and Cree is standing off

00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:27.200
to the side too, so.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:30.200
(as Cree) "Yeah, well, we all know each other."

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.830
MARISHA: Hey, Cree.

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:32.663
TALIESIN: Been a while.

00:19:33.548 --> 00:19:34.573
MATT: "Indeed."

00:19:34.573 --> 00:19:36.020
MARISHA: Good of you to be so forthcoming

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:39.963
when we checked in, asked you some questions.

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:46.971
MATT: "Well, I was a bit preoccupied,

00:19:47.938 --> 00:19:48.937
"as you can see.

00:19:48.937 --> 00:19:52.520
"I've told you a little bit about these people."

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:56.530
Molly turns and goes,

00:19:56.530 --> 00:20:01.530
"Right, right, no, you said there was a past,

00:20:02.596 --> 00:20:07.421
"an encounter with something I wasn't quite present for,

00:20:07.421 --> 00:20:09.863
"but nevertheless, for this time,

00:20:10.746 --> 00:20:12.296
"let us meet for the first time.

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:16.320
"I am Lucien, the Nonagon."

00:20:18.052 --> 00:20:20.438
LAURA: <i>The</i> Nonagon?

00:20:20.438 --> 00:20:25.363
LIAM: So you really have no memory of any of us?

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:27.710
MATT: "Not particularly."

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:30.130
MARISHA: But you remember Cree,

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:34.533
and the rest of the Tomb Takers from before?

00:20:34.533 --> 00:20:37.398
MATT: "Well, we have quite a bit of history, eh?

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:41.742
"I assume that you're all referring to the...

00:20:41.742 --> 00:20:45.394
"uninvited guest who took the reins for a bit."

00:20:45.394 --> 00:20:47.269
TRAVIS: (laughs)

00:20:47.269 --> 00:20:48.917
TALIESIN: For a bit.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:20:48.917 --> 00:20:51.463
MATT: "It was likely a fragment left behind.

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:54.940
"Try as she might, the soul was too strong for her

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:57.980
"to sunder and I was pieced back together.

00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:00.030
"Such is the blessing of the true Nonagon."

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:03.557
TRAVIS: You keep saying Nonagon.

00:21:03.557 --> 00:21:05.874
What does that mean?

00:21:05.874 --> 00:21:07.004
MATT: "That means many things."

00:21:07.004 --> 00:21:08.929
TALIESIN: (negative) Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:15.943
TRAVIS: And "she," are you speaking about Lady DeRogna?

00:21:18.296 --> 00:21:20.562
MATT: "She was...

00:21:20.562 --> 00:21:22.770
"an ambitious woman,

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:25.540
"that reached beyond her means.

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:30.090
"She lacked the imagination

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:31.793
"to achieve the things

00:21:31.793 --> 00:21:34.942
"that I am achieving."

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:37.821
TRAVIS: These--

00:21:37.821 --> 00:21:41.039
LAURA: How long have you been the Nonagon?

00:21:44.381 --> 00:21:47.295
MATT: "A number of years, maybe.

00:21:47.295 --> 00:21:48.661
"Now, I've answered a few of your questions,

00:21:48.661 --> 00:21:52.305
"I've got a few of my own. It's only fair, I assume.

00:21:55.007 --> 00:21:57.867
"You all seem mighty curious, you in particular.

00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:01.003
"Why is it you followed us?"

00:22:02.165 --> 00:22:05.172
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: (laugh)

00:22:05.172 --> 00:22:07.890
TRAVIS: Ooh, that is-- long.
TALIESIN: Oh wow.

00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:09.790
MATT: He takes a small flask out of the inside of his cloak

00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:11.780
and unscrews it as he listens.

00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:16.780
LIAM: Well, you've put us
into a bit of an awkward situation.

00:22:16.927 --> 00:22:19.602
Your competitor--

00:22:20.469 --> 00:22:22.352
Caleb looks over his shoulder--

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:27.305
she was our charge.

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:29.900
She hired us to come here,

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:33.580
and now we've found ourselves on our own,

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:38.580
and she will be missed where she comes from.

00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:42.070
MATT: "I'm sure she will, I'm sure she will,

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:45.930
"but, you know, as the adage goes,

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:47.163
"you play with fire,

00:22:49.670 --> 00:22:52.900
"and I, on some scale, do feel sorry

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:54.230
"you got roped into that,

00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:59.230
"but, well,

00:22:59.596 --> 00:23:01.554
"I couldn't miss an opportunity.

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:05.790
"It seemed our paths were diverging to a point

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:09.256
"in an unexpected way and

00:23:09.256 --> 00:23:12.190
"she's a figure of enough power

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:15.556
"that it's best to get the jump if you can."

00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:18.063
LAURA: She was really powerful.

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:21.922
LIAM: And had many powerful friends

00:23:21.922 --> 00:23:23.350
who are going to want to know why

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:26.323
she is no longer among the living.

00:23:26.323 --> 00:23:28.640
MATT: "In time, I'm sure."

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:31.040
TRAVIS: You asked why we're following you.

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:34.043
I'm sure your friend, Cree, has filled you in.

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:38.557
We had quite the history with...

00:23:40.113 --> 00:23:42.064
you?

00:23:42.064 --> 00:23:45.080
LAURA: With your fragment.

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:49.773
TRAVIS: Before this Lucien, it's more than a bit awkward.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.610
We had very fond feelings.

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:57.218
LIAM: Yes, this forgotten fragment of yours was a

00:23:57.218 --> 00:23:58.340
friend of ours.

00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:00.090
MATT: "So you felt for this empty speck.

00:24:03.091 --> 00:24:04.758
"That explains a bit."

00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:09.890
SAM: If I may, this friend of ours,

00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:12.010
he resided in your body.

00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:14.593
You have such contempt for him, it seems.

00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:17.260
MATT: "It's hard to have contempt for something

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:19.423
"that doesn't really matter."

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:24.841
SAM: But he did matter to some people.

00:24:26.145 --> 00:24:27.830
He mattered to us.

00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:31.483
MATT: "It was but a part of myself, and I'm back."

00:24:32.424 --> 00:24:35.030
LIAM: And you're not even curious where they came from,

00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:36.520
where they've gone now?

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:37.390
MATT: "I mean..."

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:39.570
TALIESIN: Or how you ended up that way.

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:40.950
MATT: "It's a bit strange, sure,

00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:43.970
"but I'm sure all information will be laid bare

00:24:45.158 --> 00:24:46.900
"when I finish my path."

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.360
LAURA: Was that the first time that happened?

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:52.003
MATT: "First time, hopefully the last time.

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:55.750
"So tell me again, why are you here?

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:57.421
"Is it vengeance?"

00:24:57.421 --> 00:24:58.254
LAURA: No.

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:00.923
SAM: We came,

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:03.780
we were hired to come here,

00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:08.780
and we were told it was an exploratory, you know--

00:25:08.813 --> 00:25:10.780
TRAVIS: Expedition.
SAM: Expedition.

00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:12.810
LAURA: It is a very good question,

00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:14.790
because we really could have just left

00:25:14.790 --> 00:25:16.850
after everything fell apart, but...

00:25:17.873 --> 00:25:20.090
LIAM: I think we're seeking better understanding.

00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:20.923
LAURA: Yeah.

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:23.180
ASHLEY: I think we actually were

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:25.583
just looking for our friend, so...

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:29.997
MATT: "I understand grief can be hard sometimes

00:25:29.997 --> 00:25:31.970
"for folks to swallow,

00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:34.170
"but your friend is gone,

00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:36.811
"and I've taken back what's rightfully mine."

00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:39.291
TALIESIN: Detect undead.

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:42.238
MATT: Okay.

00:25:42.238 --> 00:25:43.473
TALIESIN: Whole room.

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:47.343
MATT: Nothing really--
TALIESIN: Interesting.

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:50.730
MARISHA: You mentioned being on a path.

00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:53.477
Where is this path leading you?

00:25:53.477 --> 00:25:54.877
MATT: "(chuckles)

00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:59.493
"North-ish.

00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:03.190
"I've got unfinished business here in Eiselcross."

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:06.390
MARISHA: Unfinished business?

00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:07.223
MATT: "Uh-huh."

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:10.118
TRAVIS: North of Aeor?

00:26:14.654 --> 00:26:17.571
MATT: "To Aeor, if we're being specific."

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:25.410
TRAVIS: You've obviously detected, no doubt,

00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:27.923
that we are at a disadvantage.

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:33.440
As was said, we were contracted to escort Lady DeRogna here,

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:36.340
and now that she's departed, we are picking up the pieces.

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:41.090
SAM: Yes, we won't be paid for our services

00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:42.070
as we were promised,

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:44.870
because you've killed our employer,

00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:47.303
and so we find ourselves...

00:26:50.145 --> 00:26:51.428
freelancing

00:26:51.428 --> 00:26:53.430
with no mission.

00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:58.430
MATT: "If you're worried about
this death being put upon you,

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:02.330
"well, rest assured, when I finish my journey,

00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:06.253
"I'm more than happy to take my place,

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:10.340
"wherever such laws would deem it unnecessary."

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:14.863
TRAVIS: To take your place?

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:17.562
MATT: "To explain what I've done."

00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:22.060
TRAVIS: So you aim to be a public figure,

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:26.753
or is it more would you prefer to remain hidden?

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:32.177
MATT: "Little bit of column A,
little bit of column B."

00:27:36.081 --> 00:27:37.215
MARISHA: Sure.

00:27:37.215 --> 00:27:40.541
TALIESIN: These people, were they following you?

00:27:41.466 --> 00:27:46.060
MATT: "No, they just happened to be first,

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:47.913
"and not eager to share."

00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:52.603
TALIESIN: Not going to pretend we haven't done worse.

00:27:55.770 --> 00:27:58.400
MARISHA: You mentioned that you were <i>the</i> Nonagon.

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:01.920
Have you always been <i>the</i> Nonagon,

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:04.241
or is that a recent title?

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:11.428
MATT: "It was a title that I claimed

00:28:12.311 --> 00:28:16.036
"before my brief departure

00:28:16.036 --> 00:28:17.475
"from this plane."

00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:21.680
TALIESIN: And have you killed the last person

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:23.880
who held that title?

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:26.310
MATT: "No, the last person to hold that title disappeared

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:27.880
"a long time ago."

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:29.063
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:33.178
LIAM: Does that have have anything to do with these?

00:28:34.792 --> 00:28:35.925
And these?

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:39.425
LAURA: These hands and these necks?

00:28:39.425 --> 00:28:42.092
(laughter)

00:28:42.092 --> 00:28:45.461
SAM: The eye tattoos.
LAURA: The tattoos, specifically.

00:28:45.461 --> 00:28:47.318
SAM: ♪ These hands ♪

00:28:47.318 --> 00:28:49.410
LIAM: ♪ Are not my ♪

00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:51.084
MATT: "Why yes, they do."

00:28:51.084 --> 00:28:52.790
MARISHA: Can I insight check him on that whole

00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:55.332
"the last title was held a long time ago"?

00:28:55.332 --> 00:28:56.415
MATT: Go for it.

00:28:56.415 --> 00:28:57.905
MARISHA: General insight check.

00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:00.669
TRAVIS: We'll just get a rolling insight check going.

00:29:00.669 --> 00:29:03.613
MARISHA: Just, you know, a standard
rolling insight check. 26.

00:29:03.613 --> 00:29:06.601
MATT: 26. Seems to be telling the truth.

00:29:07.563 --> 00:29:10.378
LAURA: Can you actually see through all those eyeballs?

00:29:10.378 --> 00:29:12.610
MATT: "I can see many things through these eyes."

00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:14.400
LAURA: So like, because I was scrying on you,

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:15.480
you caught me scrying, right?

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:17.360
MATT: "I can see through many eyes still."

00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:19.360
As he begins to like put out his arms,

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:22.880
you can see the eyes begin to light up red across his body,

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:26.608
and as he does, you see the eyes of his companions,

00:29:26.608 --> 00:29:28.500
the Tomb Takers, their eyes begin to glow red,

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.450
and he goes,

00:29:30.450 --> 00:29:34.416
"That way, not much can escape my vision.

00:29:34.416 --> 00:29:35.510
"This blessing."

00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:37.870
And as he says that, the voices of the other Tomb Takers

00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:40.473
also speak the same words in unison with him

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:43.445
before the red fades from their eyes

00:29:43.445 --> 00:29:45.884
and his fade as well.

00:29:48.810 --> 00:29:50.514
MARISHA: Oh, shit.
LAURA: Did-- do--

00:29:50.514 --> 00:29:51.347
How does--

00:29:53.393 --> 00:29:55.210
Do you like take control when that happens,

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:59.283
or are you all one person, or?

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:04.290
MATT: "We're just well-connected."

00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:08.520
And then you see over on the side, this halfling member

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:09.810
of the Tomb Takers, in their voice,

00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:11.721
looks to you and says,

00:30:11.721 --> 00:30:13.792
"We've been through a lot,

00:30:13.792 --> 00:30:16.310
"and we understand what needs to be done."

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:18.010
He moves over to Cree, who's like--

00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:20.271
follows up immediately after that sentence.

00:30:20.271 --> 00:30:22.190
You see that bit of red still lingering

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:23.023
in their eyes.

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:26.560
"That is why we fight forward,

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:29.963
"to bring the Nonagon to his destined precipice."

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:33.016
TALIESIN: And what is that precipice?

00:30:34.376 --> 00:30:38.520
MATT: "Well, if you're on the same path as us,

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:40.268
"perhaps you'll see."

00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:44.030
MARISHA: Can I see tattoos on any of the other Tomb Takers?

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:45.240
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:47.040
SAM: And how many Tomb Takers are there?

00:30:48.602 --> 00:30:52.042
MATT: There's five currently, including Molly.

00:30:52.042 --> 00:30:52.875
MARISHA: Nine!

00:30:52.875 --> 00:30:54.530
SAM: And have we gotten a good look at them?

00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:57.280
Do we have descriptions yet, or no?

00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:58.512
TRAVIS: Halfling, Cree.

00:30:58.512 --> 00:31:03.512
MATT: So there is a halfling, who is dressed

00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:05.845
in darker leather armor,

00:31:05.845 --> 00:31:08.485
with a crossbow at their side.

00:31:08.485 --> 00:31:12.031
Their expression is a bit gaunt and sallow.

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:15.793
Female with wild hair.

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:20.480
There is a goliath, who is currently standing

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:22.840
with a massive, heavy maul,

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:26.600
the head on the ground leaning a little bit into it.

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:29.340
The other arm resting on his other shoulder

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:30.333
as he watches.

00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:34.408
You see there is a

00:31:36.808 --> 00:31:39.182
human woman,

00:31:39.182 --> 00:31:43.860
who has a longsword and a shield strapped across her back.

00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:47.159
Dark hair that tumbles down

00:31:47.159 --> 00:31:48.492
past the shoulders, long,

00:31:48.492 --> 00:31:52.457
in the front of half plate armor,

00:31:52.457 --> 00:31:56.880
and you also see Cree,

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:59.837
the familiar black-furred tabaxi,

00:31:59.837 --> 00:32:03.040
standing with a necklace

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:06.720
with a red, circular, polished orb

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:08.219
in the center of it.

00:32:08.219 --> 00:32:10.210
SAM: So it's four plus--
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:11.252
SAM: It's four plus Molly.

00:32:11.252 --> 00:32:14.540
TRAVIS: Oh, okay.
SAM: Or Lucien.

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:16.264
MATT: Lucien, I should say.

00:32:16.264 --> 00:32:18.513
LIAM: You see so much,

00:32:18.513 --> 00:32:20.285
and then there's these.

00:32:21.497 --> 00:32:24.580
What do the Eyes of Nine mean to you, if anything?

00:32:25.424 --> 00:32:26.891
MATT: "I have nine eyes here.

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:31.470
"Each of them granted to me by each eye

00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:35.570
"that gave me this title."

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:39.378
LIAM: Who gave you this title?

00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:42.100
MATT: "Maybe you'll meet them.

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:48.330
"You said you were looking for work, right?

00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:50.848
"You're directionless, pathless,

00:32:50.848 --> 00:32:55.848
"aimless and fearful to return for reprisal awaits you,

00:32:56.273 --> 00:32:58.740
"given the loss of your employer."

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:00.047
SAM: No, that's absolutely true.

00:33:00.047 --> 00:33:02.840
We're probably wanted men and women here,

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:04.610
and we have no money,

00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:06.370
and we have no purpose right now,

00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:09.885
so yes, we need a direction for sure.

00:33:13.379 --> 00:33:14.537
MATT: "(chuckles)

00:33:16.884 --> 00:33:19.384
"Well, you're free to follow.

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:21.610
"I can guarantee you, where we're going,

00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:24.202
"it's only going to get stranger."

00:33:24.202 --> 00:33:26.960
TRAVIS: You mentioned your destined precipice.

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:29.210
Are you a believer in fate?

00:33:31.992 --> 00:33:34.153
MATT: "Not so much in the classic sense.

00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:40.432
"Divinity seems to nudge and push in places, unchallenged."

00:33:42.150 --> 00:33:45.083
TRAVIS: It's interesting that our path

00:33:45.083 --> 00:33:47.360
has crossed with yours

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:48.413
many times now.

00:33:49.563 --> 00:33:50.805
I wonder why that is.

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:52.933
MATT: "Indeed.

00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:59.358
"Well, nevertheless, this has been a fun,

00:33:59.358 --> 00:34:00.891
"fine conversation.

00:34:01.793 --> 00:34:03.100
"We'll take what we were looking for

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:04.270
"and be on our way.

00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:06.130
"And if you'd like to follow behind,

00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:06.963
"well--"

00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:09.479
"Be our guests,"

00:34:09.479 --> 00:34:12.700
they all say in unison together.

00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:14.340
LIAM: How far are you going?

00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:18.323
Somewhere on this sliver of reality, or further afield?

00:34:20.275 --> 00:34:22.838
MATT: See the eyes narrow a bit from Lucien's face.

00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:29.923
"On the field, and perhaps a bit beyond."

00:34:32.350 --> 00:34:35.433
TRAVIS: This room, if you're moving on,

00:34:35.433 --> 00:34:37.874
is extraordinary.

00:34:39.004 --> 00:34:43.463
Do you know what any of this is?

00:34:43.463 --> 00:34:46.204
MATT: "Aye." (whistles)

00:34:46.204 --> 00:34:47.800
Begins to whistle and points upward,

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:49.708
and you watch as the halfling

00:34:49.708 --> 00:34:53.516
and you watch as the halfling

00:34:53.516 --> 00:34:55.035
begins to walk away from the chamber

00:34:55.035 --> 00:34:57.437
and walk up the wall,

00:34:57.437 --> 00:34:59.111
and then walk across the ceiling.

00:34:59.111 --> 00:35:01.236
LAURA: Oh, that's cool.

00:35:04.302 --> 00:35:05.666
You can walk on the ceiling?

00:35:05.666 --> 00:35:07.103
SAM: Yeah, I can do that.
LAURA: You walk on the ceiling?

00:35:07.103 --> 00:35:09.532
TRAVIS: Go show him.
LAURA: Why didn't you do it then, before?

00:35:09.532 --> 00:35:12.890
SAM: I thought that I had that spell.

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:15.010
TRAVIS: I don't know if it's a spell.

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:15.843
SAM: Oh.

00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:18.030
TRAVIS: I'll head over and

00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:21.816
put my foot on the wall.
MATT: (metal clinking)

00:35:21.816 --> 00:35:23.051
Your foot just touches the wall.

00:35:23.051 --> 00:35:24.662
TRAVIS: Never mind, it's a spell.

00:35:24.662 --> 00:35:26.095
(laughter)

00:35:26.095 --> 00:35:27.630
MATT: You look up and you can see now the halfling

00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:29.431
has pulled out a hammer and chisel

00:35:29.431 --> 00:35:32.450
and is currently hammering around the seam

00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:36.638
where the gem is fixed into the ceiling.

00:35:36.638 --> 00:35:39.210
LIAM: While he works, I'm going to very obviously cast

00:35:39.210 --> 00:35:40.399
Detect Magic on it,

00:35:40.399 --> 00:35:42.948
and try to get a better understanding of it.

00:35:42.948 --> 00:35:43.942
MATT: Okay.

00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:47.490
The magic-- there is a lot of magic in this chamber,

00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:50.640
elements of it dormant, elements of it prepped,

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:53.463
and a lot of it funneling to this particular gem.

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:56.040
LIAM: I assume the Tomb Takers are

00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:57.820
a little lit up with it as well.

00:35:57.820 --> 00:35:59.176
MATT: Yes.

00:35:59.176 --> 00:36:02.827
Armor, weapons, all have some faint magical glow to them.

00:36:02.827 --> 00:36:05.300
TRAVIS: Going to take a step 20 feet away from Caleb.

00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:08.566
MATT: The room has a very strong

00:36:09.849 --> 00:36:13.070
teleportation aspect

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:15.060
to the sigils and glyphs,

00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:19.823
and the gem itself, a very strong aura of conjuration.

00:36:21.763 --> 00:36:22.596
LIAM: Okay.

00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:26.690
LAURA: What are you going to do with that thing?

00:36:28.466 --> 00:36:30.070
MATT: "Maybe you'll find out."

00:36:31.337 --> 00:36:33.745
MARISHA: Did I happen to notice any other tattoos

00:36:33.745 --> 00:36:35.410
on any of them?

00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:36.835
MATT: You rolled a--?
MARISHA: Nine.

00:36:36.835 --> 00:36:37.905
MATT: A nine?
MARISHA: Not great.

00:36:37.905 --> 00:36:39.938
MATT: No, didn't notice any.

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:43.345
ASHLEY: I have a question.

00:36:43.345 --> 00:36:46.395
So Vess,

00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:49.453
she also had the tattoos.

00:36:51.070 --> 00:36:52.585
Who was she to you?

00:36:55.405 --> 00:36:59.008
MATT: "(sighs) She was a traitor.

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:04.130
"Someone who agreed to help me, us really,

00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:09.130
"some time ago, and, well,

00:37:10.393 --> 00:37:12.470
"lied.

00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:17.470
"Lied and put me from this plane for some time.

00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:19.413
"Shattered me, if you will.

00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:22.630
"Scattered this spirit,

00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:27.030
"but they put me back together."

00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:29.826
LIAM: Was she the one who put you in the ground?

00:37:29.826 --> 00:37:30.916
MATT: "Aye."

00:37:30.916 --> 00:37:33.274
TRAVIS: Fuck.

00:37:33.274 --> 00:37:35.770
SAM: Just because I sort of relate to this,

00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:39.810
I was not in my body for a couple of years also,

00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:42.971
so I feel ya.

00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:47.749
But-- and it was a horrible experience.

00:37:47.749 --> 00:37:50.110
I was still here on this plane.

00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:51.300
Did you go elsewhere?

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:53.140
Did you travel to somewhere else

00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:55.533
while you were out of your body?

00:37:57.140 --> 00:37:58.880
MATT: See Lucien takes a couple steps forward

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:00.361
and kneels in front of you,

00:38:00.361 --> 00:38:02.100
looking you directly in the eye,

00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:04.260
from about 15 feet away,

00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:05.430
although if you're still up at the top,

00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:07.763
probably looking up at you, actually.

00:38:11.533 --> 00:38:13.300
"It's one thing to be in a different body,

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:17.690
"it's another to have your very essence scattered.

00:38:17.690 --> 00:38:21.760
"Your very immortal soul divided into pieces,

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:24.145
"like so much confetti.

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:31.240
"I believe you seemed to fall for one of those pieces

00:38:32.273 --> 00:38:34.714
"that stuck behind,

00:38:34.714 --> 00:38:39.589
"but the thing is,

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:44.543
"this soul bore the mark of those that gave me this title.

00:38:45.851 --> 00:38:48.511
"They knew my import and they put me back together.

00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:54.245
"And the moment that vessel became empty once more,

00:38:55.484 --> 00:38:59.670
"well," looks over to Cree,

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:01.070
"I was happy to return.

00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:06.333
"So if we both found our ways back to our true selves,

00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:09.673
"well, it's a year for celebration, is it not?"

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:13.273
SAM: Yep.

00:39:14.130 --> 00:39:15.830
LAURA: So you're like a bunch of souls?

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:17.953
MATT: "No.

00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:20.713
"Just a healing one."

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:25.627
You still hear the continuous (hammer clinking)

00:39:25.627 --> 00:39:27.303
across the ceiling.

00:39:28.370 --> 00:39:31.045
LIAM: And this entity that gave you your title,

00:39:31.045 --> 00:39:36.045
your powers, I presume you are their servant,

00:39:36.078 --> 00:39:37.511
their equal?

00:39:41.917 --> 00:39:43.792
MATT: "I am...

00:39:47.951 --> 00:39:50.184
"I don't think servant's the right word.

00:39:51.570 --> 00:39:53.370
"I am a student,

00:39:54.528 --> 00:39:59.501
"as well as an entrusted representative."

00:39:59.501 --> 00:40:00.334
"as well as an entrusted representative."

00:40:02.570 --> 00:40:05.380
TRAVIS: While the work is being done on the gem up top,

00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:08.130
can I loop around the back?

00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:11.040
Because there's stairs and a platform

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:12.550
at the back of the room?

00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:14.510
MATT: You guys are up on a platform,

00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:17.475
stairs that go down in the center as well.

00:40:17.475 --> 00:40:19.780
They are down below in the main chamber,

00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:20.613
where the gem sits.

00:40:20.613 --> 00:40:22.710
TRAVIS: And there's no alcoves, or shelves,

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:24.610
or other items that would be worth looking at?

00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:27.330
I'm sure, not like this big-ass gem in the ceiling,

00:40:27.330 --> 00:40:29.397
but anything at all that's interesting?

00:40:29.397 --> 00:40:30.660
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:40:34.944 --> 00:40:39.800
TRAVIS: 16 plus three, 19.

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:43.440
MATT: 19, glancing around, there aren't any shelf units,

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:47.331
there aren't any sort of scattered boxes

00:40:47.331 --> 00:40:49.480
or loose objects.

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:53.217
This chamber seems to be designed for a particular

00:40:53.217 --> 00:40:57.490
concentrated purpose, and you just see bits of rubble,

00:40:57.490 --> 00:40:59.070
and like fallen rock, and you do see elements

00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:01.510
where the chamber has sustained some structural damage,

00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:04.226
probably from the impact of this ruin,

00:41:04.226 --> 00:41:08.222
but for the most part, it's outfitted

00:41:08.222 --> 00:41:10.576
only in the structure itself.

00:41:10.576 --> 00:41:12.089
TRAVIS: It's a Holodeck, y'all.

00:41:14.730 --> 00:41:16.660
MATT: And as you're walking, getting a glance,

00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:20.100
the goliath figure is still leaning on the maul,

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:24.033
just keeps his eye on you as you walk past.

00:41:25.350 --> 00:41:28.232
They're all just smiling creepily.

00:41:28.232 --> 00:41:29.198
TALIESIN: Cree.

00:41:30.875 --> 00:41:32.630
MATT: (as Cree) "Mm?"

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:36.913
TALIESIN: Did you dig it up, or did he come to you?

00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:43.090
MATT: "When I heard that the vessel was available,

00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:48.249
"well, I went to see if perhaps there was a chance

00:41:48.249 --> 00:41:53.249
"he would return, and as you see,

00:41:53.977 --> 00:41:56.435
"we were very lucky to have him back."

00:41:56.435 --> 00:42:00.176
TALIESIN: And you're sure you put him back together right?

00:42:00.176 --> 00:42:04.220
MATT: "Well, so far so good,"

00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:06.890
you hear as her voice and his voice both merge

00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:08.680
on that final sentence.

00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:09.983
TALIESIN: Would you even know?

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:15.890
Well, I hope, I do hope

00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:17.515
that all the parts are there.

00:42:18.889 --> 00:42:19.780
MATT: Tink!

00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:21.960
At that point you hear (crunching),

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:25.070
and the goliath lets the maul fall for a second,

00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:27.160
puts the arms out and (impacts),

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:29.363
catches this heavy blue stone,

00:42:30.779 --> 00:42:31.943
and puts it under his arm.

00:42:31.943 --> 00:42:35.680
SAM: Does it look like just a normal jewel or anything?

00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:36.560
LAURA: Is it a sapphire?

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:38.340
MATT: One side of it is polished.

00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:40.440
The part that's facing you all,

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:42.240
it's polished smooth.

00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:45.540
The part that was set comes to a gradual point

00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:49.590
on the back end, and has various facets that are all

00:42:49.590 --> 00:42:51.310
dug towards the point.

00:42:51.310 --> 00:42:54.690
So he catches it, it almost looks like an odd,

00:42:54.690 --> 00:42:58.290
like a weather balloon shape, almost.

00:42:58.290 --> 00:43:00.460
He takes it and holds it there.

00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:02.420
LIAM: We all know who made this.

00:43:03.330 --> 00:43:06.963
I assume that is your ticket through the veil.

00:43:08.217 --> 00:43:13.217
MATT: "Oh, no. This is one of many gifts I bring.

00:43:13.355 --> 00:43:17.462
"The ticket through the veil lies a little further down."

00:43:17.462 --> 00:43:20.930
LIAM: I am very curious, are you looking

00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:23.033
to bring the past back to the present?

00:43:24.050 --> 00:43:26.218
Is that what this is about?

00:43:26.218 --> 00:43:28.250
MATT: "There's a lot of things that are possible

00:43:28.250 --> 00:43:29.681
"up in Aeor's ruin.

00:43:31.710 --> 00:43:35.790
"I sense you're one curious about possibilities as well."

00:43:35.790 --> 00:43:37.735
LIAM: Well, it's in my nature.

00:43:37.735 --> 00:43:40.698
MATT: "Well, then you're going to have a lot of fun.

00:43:40.698 --> 00:43:42.546
"There's so much to find."

00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:46.920
MARISHA: You mentioned that these eyes

00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:51.343
felt you were important enough to bring back.

00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:54.390
What makes you so sure they're not going to feel

00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:55.500
the same about Vess?

00:43:56.521 --> 00:43:57.354
MATT: "Oh.

00:44:00.496 --> 00:44:02.954
"Vess has more selfish tendencies.

00:44:04.748 --> 00:44:06.991
"I was the first chosen.

00:44:06.991 --> 00:44:11.648
"She was the imposter,

00:44:11.648 --> 00:44:14.230
"the intended usurper."

00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:17.590
MARISHA: But still chosen. I saw those tattoos.

00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:22.583
MATT: "Oh, those were her misunderstanding of the tome

00:44:22.583 --> 00:44:24.200
"that she took from me.

00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:28.965
"She had no claim to the title.

00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:39.753
"Nevertheless, our work here is complete."

00:44:43.791 --> 00:44:45.491
ASHLEY: Wait, but how do you get the tattoos?

00:44:45.491 --> 00:44:49.580
ASHLEY: Wait, but how do you get the tattoos?

00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:51.388
I mean, I know how you got

00:44:51.388 --> 00:44:53.605
most of your tattoos.
SAM: We've all got tattoos.

00:44:53.605 --> 00:44:55.310
LAURA: Yeah, we've got some really cool ones.

00:44:55.310 --> 00:44:58.902
ASHLEY: I was even with you when you got some of those,

00:44:58.902 --> 00:45:01.940
but specifically the eye tattoos,

00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:03.513
how do you get them?

00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:11.693
MATT: "You all seem very curious."

00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:16.230
SAM: We knew you, and you seem so different now.

00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:17.630
LAURA: Yeah, it's kind of weird,

00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:19.670
because we thought we'd never see you up and walking again,

00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:23.550
and here you are, you're walking around, and I don't know.

00:45:23.550 --> 00:45:26.570
SAM: Yeah, and you don't even seem curious about yourself.

00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:28.850
I mean, you were nice, we really liked you.

00:45:28.850 --> 00:45:31.316
And you don't seem to give a shit about that at all.

00:45:31.316 --> 00:45:34.190
MARISHA: To be fair, he wasn't curious about himself

00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:36.201
when Molly was alive either.

00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:40.227
SAM: It's fine, we'll leave you alone.

00:45:40.227 --> 00:45:42.776
You can do your stealing or whatever.

00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:45.190
MATT: "So we're free to leave?"

00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:48.700
TRAVIS: Oh, I don't think you're asking permission

00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:53.700
from any of us, but I think we appreciate the gesture.

00:45:53.867 --> 00:45:55.610
MATT: "Of course.

00:45:55.610 --> 00:45:58.870
"Well, we'll be on our way.

00:45:58.870 --> 00:45:59.910
"Should you feel inclined,

00:45:59.910 --> 00:46:03.169
"and the curiosity continues to tug at your souls,

00:46:03.169 --> 00:46:06.200
"well, follow the footprints in the snow."

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:09.016
SAM: If we do, are we

00:46:09.016 --> 00:46:11.458
to be making camp with you

00:46:11.458 --> 00:46:14.507
and fighting off the same monsters on the path?

00:46:14.507 --> 00:46:18.032
and fighting off the same monsters on the path?

00:46:19.131 --> 00:46:22.380
MATT: "I say this with absolute respect.

00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:26.540
"Traveling with this many is an impediment

00:46:26.540 --> 00:46:29.155
"to the speed of our journey.

00:46:29.155 --> 00:46:33.080
"Follow if you like, but

00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:34.821
"too many to keep track of,

00:46:34.821 --> 00:46:37.013
"too much to draw attention,

00:46:37.013 --> 00:46:38.921
"and to be perfectly honest,

00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:44.680
"I like to travel with those who I can truly understand,"

00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:47.000
as all the voices together say the final three words.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.280
TRAVIS: Jesus.
SAM: Gross.

00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:52.170
LAURA: If I send a message to you,

00:46:52.170 --> 00:46:53.896
do all the other ones hear it?

00:46:53.896 --> 00:46:56.737
Or if I send a message to Cree, would you hear it?

00:46:56.737 --> 00:46:59.154
TRAVIS: Is this a group text?

00:47:00.922 --> 00:47:01.922
TALIESIN: Group text.

00:47:03.008 --> 00:47:07.190
MATT: "It's possible, depends on how carefully connected

00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:08.272
"they are at the time."

00:47:08.272 --> 00:47:09.227
LAURA: Wow.

00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:14.360
MARISHA: Shit, I didn't mean to text that to the group.

00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:15.774
Wasn't meant for you guys, sorry.

00:47:15.774 --> 00:47:17.730
TRAVIS: We've certainly come this far.

00:47:17.730 --> 00:47:18.723
SAM: Sure, yes.

00:47:20.970 --> 00:47:24.793
TALIESIN: As, I think, the only
unaffiliated person in this room,

00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:32.007
I'd say that six strangers wandered into one of

00:47:32.007 --> 00:47:34.000
I'd say that six strangers wandered into one of

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.800
the most dangerous places that anyone knows about

00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:43.760
without any kind of psychic eye,

00:47:43.950 --> 00:47:47.050
whatever that is, because of you.

00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:49.183
Because of two years of you.

00:47:51.551 --> 00:47:54.770
Just as a casual observer, I would be really curious

00:47:54.770 --> 00:47:56.083
about those two years.

00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:03.510
MATT: "If it helps put your feelings to rest,

00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:07.000
"I am sorry, for whatever it's worth,

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:11.480
"that your friend is gone.

00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:15.163
"Whatever part of me they were,

00:48:17.079 --> 00:48:19.356
"is not of me anymore.

00:48:21.027 --> 00:48:23.663
"Truly gone.

00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:29.965
"And I understand that can be challenging,

00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:33.300
"and I'm sure even my presence now

00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:35.510
"opens a wound."

00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:36.560
TALIESIN: Insight check.

00:48:38.370 --> 00:48:39.690
Truly gone?

00:48:39.690 --> 00:48:40.930
LAURA: Yeah.

00:48:40.930 --> 00:48:41.780
TALIESIN: 25.

00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:43.835
SAM: Ooh.
MATT: 25.

00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:47.418
He seems to believe what he's saying.

00:48:47.418 --> 00:48:48.743
TALIESIN: Cool. All right.

00:48:50.612 --> 00:48:51.753
That'll do.

00:48:51.753 --> 00:48:55.313
SAM: Well, then lead and we will follow.

00:48:57.526 --> 00:49:01.960
In fact, maybe we should all sort of declare our intent

00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:04.920
as they do, all together in unison as one,

00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:06.678
don't you think?
LAURA: Oh, yeah, that sounds like a good idea.

00:49:06.678 --> 00:49:08.306
ASHLEY: At the same time.
SAM: Yeah, at the same time.

00:49:08.306 --> 00:49:09.139
TRAVIS: Count it out.

00:49:09.139 --> 00:49:11.408
ASHLEY: One, two, three.
TALIESIN: On three or after three?

00:49:11.408 --> 00:49:15.521
TRAVIS: We're going to follow along.
SAM: Follow beside you.

00:49:15.521 --> 00:49:18.022
LAURA: Also...
LIAM: Pick up Vess' body.

00:49:18.022 --> 00:49:19.323
LAURA: Candy.

00:49:19.323 --> 00:49:23.256
MATT: All of them laugh as one for about 10 seconds

00:49:23.256 --> 00:49:25.307
before falling silent simultaneously.

00:49:25.307 --> 00:49:29.757
(forced laughter)
TALIESIN: I don't get it.

00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:31.956
MATT: "You're real cute.

00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:34.880
"I'll ask that you stay at least a bit back,

00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:37.202
"because you're starting to get annoying."

00:49:37.202 --> 00:49:39.954
LAURA: Sorry.
LIAM: Where are you headed next?

00:49:39.954 --> 00:49:40.787
MATT: "Well..."

00:49:40.787 --> 00:49:43.210
LIAM: We do have interest here in the north.

00:49:43.210 --> 00:49:47.044
MATT: "To alpha and alpha, then homeward bound, right?"

00:49:47.044 --> 00:49:47.950
LAURA: Obviously.

00:49:47.950 --> 00:49:52.401
SAM: So this is A5, so then A2?

00:49:52.401 --> 00:49:54.742
MATT: "I've got a couple of other things to pick up,"

00:49:54.742 --> 00:49:56.920
as his head nudges towards the goliath

00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:57.993
clutching the stone.

00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:02.350
"But there's always more to learn.

00:50:02.350 --> 00:50:04.083
"I can't give you all the secrets right now.

00:50:04.083 --> 00:50:05.230
"That's not fun.

00:50:05.230 --> 00:50:06.790
"You want to earn knowledge."

00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:09.673
SAM: Then we won't reveal all of ours either.

00:50:11.790 --> 00:50:13.096
MATT: "Of course."

00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:19.170
ASHLEY: Before you go, I pull out my book,

00:50:19.170 --> 00:50:21.168
with all of my flowers and things.

00:50:23.290 --> 00:50:26.143
You gave me this four leaf clover one time.

00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:33.380
And you told me that hopefully that would bring me luck,

00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:35.760
and that life would be a little bit better, so--

00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:40.750
and it was, thanks to you.

00:50:40.750 --> 00:50:45.475
So I know you're not in there anymore,

00:50:45.475 --> 00:50:49.158
but we really did care about you.

00:50:51.430 --> 00:50:54.338
But, we'll be following

00:50:55.955 --> 00:50:58.071
behind you, be safe.

00:51:00.090 --> 00:51:02.626
MATT: You hand him the four leaf clover?

00:51:02.626 --> 00:51:06.970
He takes it, looks it over, twirls it in his fingers.

00:51:10.288 --> 00:51:14.672
"Well, a fine gesture.

00:51:14.672 --> 00:51:17.900
"We could all use some luck on the road ahead."

00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:19.550
Tucks it into his jacket.

00:51:23.007 --> 00:51:26.389
LIAM: A minor question right before,

00:51:26.389 --> 00:51:31.389
with Detect Magic, what on Mollymauk's--
on Lucien's body lit up?

00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:34.880
I'm sure the blades. Anything else?

00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:38.973
MATT: His entire body where any of these eyes are

00:51:38.973 --> 00:51:42.514
emanate a very strong magical aura,

00:51:42.514 --> 00:51:47.389
though it doesn't have a particular arcane school of magic

00:51:47.389 --> 00:51:50.608
that is tied to that source.

00:51:50.608 --> 00:51:51.480
LIAM: Any other objects--?

00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:55.220
MATT: If anything, the red eyes
have just an extremely intense

00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:58.377
red glow when you're detecting in that direction.

00:51:58.377 --> 00:52:01.577
LIAM: Okay, and any other objects on his person?

00:52:01.577 --> 00:52:02.410
Aside from both swords?

00:52:02.410 --> 00:52:03.740
MATT: Both of the blades and the armor

00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:06.170
are this soft leather elements,

00:52:06.170 --> 00:52:07.920
like the vest and the pants that he has on

00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:11.052
all seems to be like a connected piece of equipment.

00:52:11.052 --> 00:52:11.885
LIAM: Yeah.

00:52:14.108 --> 00:52:16.900
MATT: He puts his hands up in a "are we good?"

00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:21.390
sort of physical motion, and then takes a step forward

00:52:21.390 --> 00:52:24.240
as everyone else takes a step forward in lock step.

00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:26.440
And they push their way through you,

00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:30.040
and into the hallway.

00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:32.160
MARISHA: As Cree passes,

00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:34.280
can I try and get a closer look at that necklace

00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:36.040
that she's wearing?

00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:37.959
MATT: Mm-hmm.

00:52:37.959 --> 00:52:39.406
Make a perception check.

00:52:41.170 --> 00:52:42.930
TRAVIS: Let's get him-- no, not yet.

00:52:42.930 --> 00:52:44.396
MARISHA: 20 total.

00:52:44.396 --> 00:52:46.128
ASHLEY: I take out my sword.

00:52:46.128 --> 00:52:49.120
MATT: 20 total. It's a little hard to see

00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:51.040
because it's a little bit tucked into like the heavy furs

00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:54.578
around the cloak that she's wearing, the mantle piece,

00:52:54.578 --> 00:52:57.976
but you look at it and it looks like
a small red globe about that big

00:52:57.976 --> 00:53:00.151
that is--

00:53:01.759 --> 00:53:03.142
actually with a 20, you'll be able to tell,

00:53:03.142 --> 00:53:06.158
it looks like it has some sort of red liquid in it.

00:53:07.108 --> 00:53:08.450
LAURA: Blood.
MARISHA: Blood.

00:53:08.450 --> 00:53:12.180
MATT: Kind of sloshes a very, very
little bit with her movement.

00:53:14.323 --> 00:53:15.156
MARISHA: Okay.

00:53:15.156 --> 00:53:16.467
Is anyone else wearing anything like that,

00:53:16.467 --> 00:53:17.860
or she's the only one?

00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:19.525
MATT: She's the only one that you can visibly see with that.

00:53:19.525 --> 00:53:21.979
MARISHA: See, yeah.
LIAM: (silly voice) Blood magic.

00:53:21.979 --> 00:53:23.278
LAURA: (silly voice) Blood.

00:53:23.278 --> 00:53:24.952
MARISHA: Blood.

00:53:24.952 --> 00:53:27.263
All right, let's get to know 'em. Okay.

00:53:27.263 --> 00:53:28.350
MATT: They all leave the chamber

00:53:28.350 --> 00:53:30.050
down the hall where you came from.

00:53:32.307 --> 00:53:34.460
TRAVIS: I guess the first question would be,

00:53:34.460 --> 00:53:37.720
are we taking Lady DeRogna with us?

00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:39.130
LIAM: Yes, yes.
TALIESIN: Oh, yes.

00:53:39.130 --> 00:53:40.860
MATT: Which you do notice as they're stepping through,

00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:43.243
you do hear a "Heh,"

00:53:43.243 --> 00:53:45.730
as Lucien steps over the body,

00:53:45.730 --> 00:53:48.632
and looking down gives a swift kick to the head.

00:53:49.732 --> 00:53:53.961
You hear a faint crack in the lifeless corpse.

00:53:53.961 --> 00:53:54.794
MARISHA: Yikes.

00:53:54.794 --> 00:53:56.978
TALIESIN: I was saving that for...

00:53:56.978 --> 00:53:58.330
It's fine.

00:53:58.330 --> 00:54:00.157
(laughter)
TRAVIS: For tea.

00:54:00.157 --> 00:54:01.930
LAURA: "For tea."

00:54:01.930 --> 00:54:03.005
ASHLEY: I was thirsty.

00:54:04.090 --> 00:54:06.280
LIAM: I know that we're going to want to leave pretty soon,

00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:08.770
so I begin the process of putting her

00:54:08.770 --> 00:54:10.370
back into the necklace.

00:54:10.370 --> 00:54:12.420
It's going to take me 10 to 20 minutes.

00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:15.453
LAURA: Do you think it's safe, Caleb?

00:54:15.453 --> 00:54:18.960
Like, with her in there, can she be scryed on?

00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:22.550
Can somebody, like, find her location in that?

00:54:22.550 --> 00:54:23.730
The same way...

00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:29.061
LIAM: Well, if you're really worried,

00:54:29.061 --> 00:54:33.727
we can store her in this to keep her fresh,

00:54:33.727 --> 00:54:37.698
and put the necklace into one of our bags,

00:54:37.698 --> 00:54:42.290
or on Fjord's person, because of the necklace

00:54:42.290 --> 00:54:43.852
that he's wearing now.

00:54:43.852 --> 00:54:45.960
TALIESIN: She won't decompose regardless.

00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:46.940
LIAM: Correct.

00:54:46.940 --> 00:54:48.957
TALIESIN: Anywhere we put her.

00:54:48.957 --> 00:54:50.530
LAURA: But she'd be hard to fit into the bag

00:54:50.530 --> 00:54:52.257
if she's not in the little...
TALIESIN: That's fair.

00:54:52.257 --> 00:54:53.090
LIAM: This is Liam talking.

00:54:53.090 --> 00:54:54.995
I thought things rotted and decomposed

00:54:54.995 --> 00:54:57.624
in Bags of Holding.
TALIESIN: I've cast a spell.

00:54:57.624 --> 00:54:58.660
LIAM: Oh, okay, right.

00:54:58.660 --> 00:55:00.980
TALIESIN: Every 10 days, I just have to tap her again.

00:55:00.980 --> 00:55:02.923
TRAVIS: What spell is that again?

00:55:02.923 --> 00:55:03.990
LAURA: Gentle Repose.

00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:06.100
TALIESIN: Gentle Repose.
SAM: Don't decompose.

00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:07.697
TRAVIS: Interesting.

00:55:07.697 --> 00:55:09.081
TALIESIN: That way, yeah.

00:55:09.081 --> 00:55:10.290
LAURA: Yeah, I think that'd be smart.

00:55:10.290 --> 00:55:14.383
Just so if anybody from the Assembly starts poking around.

00:55:15.630 --> 00:55:19.744
TALIESIN: That 10-minute window for
restoration is still open.

00:55:19.744 --> 00:55:21.860
No, it's not, because we didn't find her

00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:22.693
until the morning,

00:55:22.693 --> 00:55:24.360
but she's not going to go any further.

00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:25.290
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:55:25.290 --> 00:55:26.123
TALIESIN: Shit.

00:55:26.123 --> 00:55:27.291
TRAVIS: It's the formaldehyde.

00:55:27.291 --> 00:55:28.607
LAURA: Is something wrong?

00:55:30.474 --> 00:55:31.424
LIAM: What are we doing?

00:55:31.424 --> 00:55:32.524
LAURA: I don't know.

00:55:32.524 --> 00:55:34.524
LIAM: What are we doing?
LAURA: What <i>are</i> we doing?

00:55:34.524 --> 00:55:35.957
Are we following him?

00:55:35.957 --> 00:55:37.714
SAM: We actually followed Beau's plan.

00:55:37.714 --> 00:55:40.046
Beau was like, "Let's talk."

00:55:40.046 --> 00:55:42.677
"Let's be friends." We did it, right?

00:55:43.664 --> 00:55:44.554
Gold stars?

00:55:44.554 --> 00:55:46.324
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

00:55:46.324 --> 00:55:47.157
SAM: 'Kay.

00:55:47.157 --> 00:55:49.864
MARISHA: Also, even though we totally sucked

00:55:49.864 --> 00:55:52.357
and let Vess die,

00:55:53.484 --> 00:55:55.464
proved my theory was right.

00:55:55.464 --> 00:55:57.024
SAM: That's the most important thing.

00:55:57.024 --> 00:55:58.584
TRAVIS: Definitely the most important.

00:55:58.584 --> 00:56:01.374
MARISHA: Yeah, just felt like I should point that out.

00:56:01.374 --> 00:56:04.634
TALIESIN: I felt like this went rather
well, all things considered.

00:56:04.634 --> 00:56:06.044
SAM: So, we're following along

00:56:06.044 --> 00:56:09.074
as they do their nefarious thing.

00:56:09.074 --> 00:56:09.907
TALIESIN: Well...

00:56:09.907 --> 00:56:10.974
SAM: Should we try get in front of them?

00:56:10.974 --> 00:56:12.047
Should we try to move faster than them?

00:56:12.047 --> 00:56:13.474
MARISHA: I was wondering that, too.

00:56:13.474 --> 00:56:17.104
Or what's the most likely--

00:56:17.104 --> 00:56:18.324
which direction they're going?

00:56:18.324 --> 00:56:23.292
Maybe we can go the opposite way and hit a different Alpha.

00:56:23.292 --> 00:56:25.304
TRAVIS: We're at A5.

00:56:25.304 --> 00:56:29.244
The only other site on this side of that giant lava river,

00:56:29.244 --> 00:56:32.100
as indicated by this map, is A2.

00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:34.254
But it is far north and west.

00:56:34.254 --> 00:56:36.374
It's probably the furthest-- it is the furthest point

00:56:36.374 --> 00:56:38.504
from where we are right now.

00:56:38.504 --> 00:56:40.584
More center and north, a bit closer,

00:56:40.584 --> 00:56:43.404
but across the lava river is Aeor,

00:56:43.404 --> 00:56:45.724
further east and closer still,

00:56:45.724 --> 00:56:48.460
again across the lava river is A4.

00:56:49.934 --> 00:56:53.544
And then the second furthest location but far to the east

00:56:53.544 --> 00:56:55.854
is the A with the question mark.

00:56:55.854 --> 00:56:56.864
TALIESIN: I'm feeling the question mark.

00:56:56.864 --> 00:56:59.214
TRAVIS: Which I think we-- yeah, I am, too.

00:56:59.214 --> 00:57:02.339
I feel like that denotes it hasn't been explored.

00:57:04.044 --> 00:57:07.451
MARISHA: Matt, he did say they were heading to A2, right?

00:57:07.451 --> 00:57:09.924
TRAVIS: Aeor eventually.
LAURA: To Alpha and Alpha.

00:57:09.924 --> 00:57:11.944
MARISHA: To Aeor eventually, but they didn't specify

00:57:11.944 --> 00:57:14.504
that they were going to hit A2 next, or anything like that?

00:57:14.504 --> 00:57:16.462
LIAM: Unless that's what "to Alpha" means.
MATT: No, they said follow the path.

00:57:16.462 --> 00:57:19.244
TRAVIS: When I asked him about Aeor,
he was like, "Eventually."

00:57:19.244 --> 00:57:20.244
They have other shit to do.

00:57:20.244 --> 00:57:21.264
TALIESIN: Hey, it's been seven days.

00:57:21.264 --> 00:57:23.274
TRAVIS: But I think, I would guess,

00:57:23.274 --> 00:57:25.597
they got to hit all of these spots.

00:57:27.267 --> 00:57:29.272
LAURA: I don't know.
TRAVIS: 'Cause I mean, I've they've been--

00:57:29.272 --> 00:57:31.284
my theory would be, if they're traveling from the South,

00:57:31.284 --> 00:57:33.144
which everyone seems to need to,

00:57:33.144 --> 00:57:35.304
unless they came from the West.

00:57:35.304 --> 00:57:37.854
They have to hit one of these spots.

00:57:37.854 --> 00:57:40.231
They could have hit Syrinlya,

00:57:40.231 --> 00:57:42.074
which is on the far eastern point,

00:57:42.074 --> 00:57:44.654
so they could have hit "A?" spot first,

00:57:44.654 --> 00:57:46.978
but I think they need a piece from everything.

00:57:46.978 --> 00:57:47.944
LIAM: It still doesn't feel like we're

00:57:47.944 --> 00:57:49.504
acting from any position of strength.

00:57:49.504 --> 00:57:51.994
They have been one step ahead of us this entire time.

00:57:51.994 --> 00:57:53.194
They've been able to watch us.

00:57:53.194 --> 00:57:54.174
There is no guarantee

00:57:54.174 --> 00:57:55.686
that if we think we're taking a shortcut

00:57:55.686 --> 00:57:57.414
or pulling a fast one on us,

00:57:57.414 --> 00:58:00.654
they won't be watching us most of the time.

00:58:00.654 --> 00:58:01.487
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:58:02.434 --> 00:58:05.517
TALIESIN: Where is Lucien's next destination?

00:58:06.734 --> 00:58:07.823
I don't know.

00:58:07.823 --> 00:58:11.144
(laughter)

00:58:11.144 --> 00:58:13.231
LIAM: Did Cad just pull out a magic eight ball?

00:58:13.231 --> 00:58:15.313
TALIESIN: I--
TRAVIS: What is that?

00:58:15.313 --> 00:58:17.213
LAURA: Were you trying to--?
TALIESIN: Try again later.

00:58:17.213 --> 00:58:18.325
Divine Intervention for the day.

00:58:18.325 --> 00:58:19.934
LAURA: You were trying to get Divine Intervention?

00:58:19.934 --> 00:58:21.359
TALIESIN: Yeah, rolled my percentile.

00:58:21.359 --> 00:58:22.874
LAURA: Man, I got to use Divine Intervention more, y'all.

00:58:22.874 --> 00:58:23.707
TALIESIN: Every day.

00:58:23.707 --> 00:58:24.753
Give it one roll everyday.

00:58:24.753 --> 00:58:25.774
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

00:58:25.774 --> 00:58:26.844
TRAVIS: It's a lottery ticket.

00:58:26.844 --> 00:58:27.974
LIAM: Divine intervention, y'all.

00:58:27.974 --> 00:58:29.551
TALIESIN: One out of 10.

00:58:29.551 --> 00:58:30.384
Or no.

00:58:30.384 --> 00:58:31.691
TRAVIS: No, it's less than that.

00:58:31.691 --> 00:58:33.957
MARISHA: Hey, what happens if--

00:58:33.957 --> 00:58:36.174
it seems like you need to do a ritual.

00:58:36.174 --> 00:58:37.174
Like you need somebody there

00:58:37.174 --> 00:58:39.564
to bring one of these people back,

00:58:39.564 --> 00:58:43.144
but say hypothetically if Vess were just

00:58:43.144 --> 00:58:46.502
to snap awake with life in her veins.

00:58:46.502 --> 00:58:47.934
LIAM: I'm dragging her to the center

00:58:47.934 --> 00:58:49.227
of the room while you were talking.

00:58:49.227 --> 00:58:51.524
MARISHA: Uh huh, I'm just talking

00:58:51.524 --> 00:58:53.332
alongside her snapped neck.

00:58:55.206 --> 00:58:58.184
What happens if she's in this thing?

00:58:58.184 --> 00:58:59.744
Would she immediately suffocate

00:58:59.744 --> 00:59:02.597
if she tried to come back to life in there?

00:59:03.484 --> 00:59:05.704
LIAM: I don't think she's coming
back to life if she's in here.

00:59:05.704 --> 00:59:07.032
TALIESIN: You would have to be there.

00:59:07.032 --> 00:59:08.654
She's been dead awhile.

00:59:08.654 --> 00:59:12.034
LAURA: Yeah, also I don't think she's a true Nonagon.

00:59:12.034 --> 00:59:14.144
I think she was trying to be a Nonagon.

00:59:14.144 --> 00:59:17.864
I bet she got these things tattooed onto herself.

00:59:17.864 --> 00:59:19.707
But Lucien's tattoos...

00:59:20.834 --> 00:59:23.604
TALIESIN: She's a Not-agon, is what you're saying.

00:59:23.604 --> 00:59:24.844
LAURA: She's a Not-agon?
MARISHA: She's a Not-agon?

00:59:24.844 --> 00:59:25.677
LAURA: That's right.

00:59:25.677 --> 00:59:28.589
Lucien's came from the entities he said,

00:59:28.589 --> 00:59:33.589
whatever the nine entities were. They were gifts.

00:59:34.064 --> 00:59:36.154
TALIESIN: I feel if we're going to
have a real discussion about this,

00:59:36.154 --> 00:59:38.664
we should do it somewhere warm.

00:59:38.664 --> 00:59:42.603
LIAM: These are great questions,
by the way, for Lady DeRogna.

00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:46.402
SAM: Yes, we should definitely ask her what's going on.

00:59:48.569 --> 00:59:49.452
LAURA: We haven't talked to her yet?

00:59:49.452 --> 00:59:50.285
MARISHA: We talked to her.

00:59:50.285 --> 00:59:52.148
TALIESIN: It takes seven days before
we can, and it's only been.

00:59:52.148 --> 00:59:53.747
MARISHA: We <i>can</i> talk to her.
LIAM: We can.

00:59:53.747 --> 00:59:55.014
TALIESIN: Has it been seven days?

00:59:55.904 --> 00:59:58.384
LIAM: Well, I don't know but Caleb does.

00:59:58.384 --> 00:59:59.217
How long has it been?

00:59:59.217 --> 01:00:01.273
MATT: It's been about five and a half days.

01:00:01.273 --> 01:00:02.106
TRAVIS: Five and a half.
LAURA: Soon.

01:00:02.106 --> 01:00:04.884
TALIESIN: A couple more days and then
we can ask five more questions.

01:00:04.884 --> 01:00:06.174
MARISHA: When's our window, though,

01:00:06.174 --> 01:00:08.571
of when we need to bring her back to life?

01:00:08.571 --> 01:00:10.584
TALIESIN: That's gone.

01:00:10.584 --> 01:00:14.914
LAURA: I mean we can technically bring
her back, like, after a year.

01:00:14.914 --> 01:00:16.259
TRAVIS: We're not doing that, right?

01:00:16.259 --> 01:00:18.460
TALIESIN: But that's a big spell.
TRAVIS: We're not doing that.

01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:19.293
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:00:19.293 --> 01:00:20.854
TALIESIN: And that's a lot.

01:00:20.854 --> 01:00:22.174
TRAVIS: Yeah, we know more about her

01:00:22.174 --> 01:00:23.774
than she ever wanted us to know.

01:00:23.774 --> 01:00:26.134
She would try and fuck us up.

01:00:26.134 --> 01:00:27.317
That's not an ally.

01:00:28.174 --> 01:00:30.804
SAM: Yeah, but we're giving her life.

01:00:30.804 --> 01:00:31.965
TRAVIS: So?
SAM: We can bring her back.

01:00:31.965 --> 01:00:32.889
TRAVIS: "Thank you." (explosion)

01:00:32.889 --> 01:00:36.326
LIAM: We offer her life and get the answers we need.

01:00:36.326 --> 01:00:39.884
She could bring the entire power

01:00:39.884 --> 01:00:42.554
of the Cerberus Assembly to bear upon us.

01:00:42.554 --> 01:00:43.554
She's dangerous.

01:00:43.554 --> 01:00:46.124
LAURA: She's bad person, probably.

01:00:46.124 --> 01:00:47.244
MARISHA: Yeah, I just don't want to be

01:00:47.244 --> 01:00:49.254
framed for murder, that's all.

01:00:49.254 --> 01:00:51.244
SAM: Well, we don't know what we're getting into so,

01:00:51.244 --> 01:00:55.514
aside asking the dead body of Vess some more questions

01:00:55.514 --> 01:00:56.819
in a day and a half,

01:00:56.819 --> 01:00:59.924
is there any way to find out what the fuck is going on

01:00:59.924 --> 01:01:02.014
and where we're going and what's at these places?

01:01:02.014 --> 01:01:04.510
LAURA: I mean, I feel like what we need to do is

01:01:04.510 --> 01:01:07.664
figure out what the fuck exactly a Nonagon is.

01:01:07.664 --> 01:01:10.124
What it is that Lucien's is trying to accomplish.

01:01:10.124 --> 01:01:11.994
That's the only way we're going to be able to

01:01:11.994 --> 01:01:15.874
tell the Assembly that's what Vess DeRogna was into, right?

01:01:15.874 --> 01:01:18.584
TRAVIS: The nine of them gave him this.

01:01:18.584 --> 01:01:21.236
The nine of who? People?
MARISHA: He said "each eye."

01:01:21.236 --> 01:01:23.224
He was granted by each eye.

01:01:23.224 --> 01:01:24.643
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MARISHA: The Eyes of Nine.

01:01:24.643 --> 01:01:25.885
SAM: Sort of like council?

01:01:25.885 --> 01:01:27.168
TRAVIS: Deities? People?

01:01:27.168 --> 01:01:31.024
SAM: The city council on that crazy dream city that we saw?

01:01:31.024 --> 01:01:32.434
TRAVIS: Yeah. I don't know.

01:01:32.434 --> 01:01:33.534
Yeah.
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

01:01:33.534 --> 01:01:36.128
SAM: They maybe gave him-- they deputized him to come here.

01:01:36.128 --> 01:01:38.638
TRAVIS: How many Betrayer Gods are there?

01:01:38.638 --> 01:01:41.404
SAM: Find a landing spot for their city?

01:01:41.404 --> 01:01:42.801
ASHLEY: Who was the original one?

01:01:44.634 --> 01:01:46.201
TALIESIN: The Octagon.

01:01:46.201 --> 01:01:47.464
LAURA and MARISHA: (chuckling)

01:01:47.464 --> 01:01:49.907
ASHLEY: That's before the Nonagon.
TALIESIN: Sorry, can't help it.

01:01:49.907 --> 01:01:50.981
Feel bad about that.

01:01:50.981 --> 01:01:52.955
ASHLEY: Don't feel bad.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:01:52.955 --> 01:01:54.202
Guilt is real.

01:01:54.202 --> 01:01:56.186
TRAVIS: Are there eight Betrayer Gods?

01:01:57.874 --> 01:02:00.212
MATT: Let me go check real fast.

01:02:03.209 --> 01:02:05.924
TALIESIN: We could get ahold of the library,

01:02:05.924 --> 01:02:07.994
ask about Nonagon, I don't know if we ever--

01:02:07.994 --> 01:02:08.887
MARISHA: I already have.

01:02:08.887 --> 01:02:11.934
TALIESIN: About Nonagon specifically?
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:02:11.934 --> 01:02:14.094
They didn't really seem to know much.

01:02:14.094 --> 01:02:18.644
MATT: There are nine Betrayer Gods as of 20 years ago.

01:02:18.644 --> 01:02:20.241
MARISHA: There are nine Betrayer Gods?

01:02:20.241 --> 01:02:22.040
SAM: 20 years ago?
LIAM: 'Cause of Vecnards.

01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:23.648
SAM: Oh.
MATT: Correct.

01:02:23.648 --> 01:02:25.547
The newest in the pantheon.

01:02:27.424 --> 01:02:28.864
TALIESIN: Huh.

01:02:28.864 --> 01:02:33.864
TRAVIS: I'm sure that's just some Fjord Stone bullshit.

01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:38.044
LIAM: We're right now sitting in the ruins

01:02:39.374 --> 01:02:41.504
of an ancient civilization that was

01:02:42.414 --> 01:02:44.744
flying through the sky, crashed here.

01:02:44.744 --> 01:02:47.194
We've had a vision of a city

01:02:47.194 --> 01:02:49.327
flying through the ether somewhere.

01:02:50.614 --> 01:02:55.334
Is Lucien really serving ancient Zemnians?

01:02:57.077 --> 01:02:58.744
TRAVIS: Oh man.
LIAM: Something else?

01:03:01.435 --> 01:03:02.914
TRAVIS: We have to make a choice.

01:03:02.914 --> 01:03:06.504
It's clear we're going one of these four other places, yes?

01:03:06.504 --> 01:03:07.629
TALIESIN: Yes.
SAM: It makes the most sense

01:03:07.629 --> 01:03:10.029
to me to at least follow them along

01:03:10.029 --> 01:03:12.324
to see which direction they're heading.

01:03:12.324 --> 01:03:14.734
TRAVIS: Great call, that's a great call.

01:03:14.734 --> 01:03:15.834
We'll know quickly.
TALIESIN: Glance out the door

01:03:15.834 --> 01:03:17.601
and we just don't go that direction.

01:03:17.601 --> 01:03:18.434
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:03:18.434 --> 01:03:21.674
MARISHA: Well, we could still follow them for a bit

01:03:21.674 --> 01:03:24.594
because they could be trying to avoid landmarks

01:03:24.594 --> 01:03:27.399
or certain impassable terrain, so I think

01:03:27.399 --> 01:03:30.317
we do need to track them for just a little bit.

01:03:30.317 --> 01:03:32.624
TRAVIS: I think it'd be a fair guess that Aeor,

01:03:32.624 --> 01:03:34.623
because it is the biggest dot on this thing

01:03:34.623 --> 01:03:37.356
and it seems like the HQ of it all,

01:03:37.356 --> 01:03:39.334
that would probably be the last place to go

01:03:39.334 --> 01:03:42.964
with maybe remnants from the other sites.

01:03:42.964 --> 01:03:45.194
MARISHA: What do you think that giant crystal was?

01:03:45.194 --> 01:03:47.504
He said he needed more things.

01:03:47.504 --> 01:03:49.836
LIAM: Well, the kind of magic

01:03:49.836 --> 01:03:51.777
it was shedding,

01:03:52.984 --> 01:03:55.764
it's for either pulling something here

01:03:55.764 --> 01:03:58.724
or sending something elsewhere.

01:03:58.724 --> 01:04:00.355
TRAVIS: Pulling something here?
LAURA: Teleporting?

01:04:00.355 --> 01:04:01.622
It's a teleporting stone?

01:04:01.622 --> 01:04:03.544
MATT: Make an arcana check.

01:04:03.544 --> 01:04:04.534
TRAVIS: Oh boy.

01:04:05.803 --> 01:04:07.844
LIAM: (clicks tongue)

01:04:07.844 --> 01:04:09.892
High. It's very high.

01:04:09.892 --> 01:04:11.213
30.

01:04:11.213 --> 01:04:12.046
MATT: 30.

01:04:13.138 --> 01:04:15.462
That was the largest

01:04:15.462 --> 01:04:19.878
threshold crest you've ever seen.
LAURA: Oh!

01:04:19.878 --> 01:04:23.244
That's what they use. That's a city mover, right?

01:04:23.244 --> 01:04:25.884
MATT: Threshold crests are smaller elements

01:04:25.884 --> 01:04:30.425
because it's a very, very specific--
TRAVIS: Holy fuck.

01:04:30.425 --> 01:04:31.716
sort of magic

01:04:31.716 --> 01:04:36.267
and is largely based in older, pre-Calamity magic.

01:04:37.421 --> 01:04:39.335
LIAM: That's what all of this is around us.

01:04:39.335 --> 01:04:42.707
This is old, very old.

01:04:42.707 --> 01:04:43.865
SAM: Old magic.

01:04:43.865 --> 01:04:44.917
LIAM: The oldest.

01:04:44.917 --> 01:04:47.483
TRAVIS: Oh, it was old magic.

01:04:47.483 --> 01:04:49.158
LIAM: It was old magic!

01:04:49.158 --> 01:04:50.459
TALIESIN: That brought that game around.

01:04:50.459 --> 01:04:51.667
TRAVIS: I should have foreseen.

01:04:51.667 --> 01:04:56.563
LIAM: The Mighty Nein. They're always after me Lucky Charms.

01:04:56.563 --> 01:04:58.204
MATT: It hits you like a lighting bolt.

01:04:58.204 --> 01:05:03.204
All of that, that entire complicated

01:05:03.778 --> 01:05:05.557
lattice of glyphwork

01:05:05.557 --> 01:05:10.554
and magic scrolling is one whole threshold crest.

01:05:10.554 --> 01:05:12.904
You've seen them used to move large cities

01:05:12.904 --> 01:05:15.597
and even large objects on a smaller scale.

01:05:17.564 --> 01:05:18.917
This was very big.

01:05:20.169 --> 01:05:22.364
MARISHA: It's got to be the same city, right?

01:05:22.364 --> 01:05:23.304
LAURA: Yeah.

01:05:23.304 --> 01:05:25.407
MARISHA: It's got to be the same city.
LAURA: They're bringing it back.

01:05:25.407 --> 01:05:27.144
MARISHA: They're trying to bring it back.

01:05:27.144 --> 01:05:29.410
Or he said--

01:05:29.410 --> 01:05:33.051
He did say this plane, <i>maybe</i> beyond.

01:05:34.224 --> 01:05:35.604
LAURA: What if he doesn't know everything?

01:05:35.604 --> 01:05:37.664
TALIESIN: I don't think so.
LAURA: And he's just following the signs, too.

01:05:37.664 --> 01:05:39.582
SAM: He knows.

01:05:39.582 --> 01:05:41.854
LAURA: I know a lot of times when people act all mysterious

01:05:41.854 --> 01:05:43.494
it's because they don't actually have the answers

01:05:43.494 --> 01:05:44.824
and they want to seem like they know it

01:05:44.824 --> 01:05:46.600
so they answer things in riddles.

01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:48.388
MARISHA: It's very Mollymauk.
TALIESIN: Right there.

01:05:48.388 --> 01:05:49.834
SAM: Is that true?

01:05:49.834 --> 01:05:53.890
Or is it the most true thing you've ever said?

01:05:55.024 --> 01:05:55.857
Am I doing it?

01:05:55.857 --> 01:05:57.065
LAURA: No, I don't think that's quite right,

01:05:57.065 --> 01:05:59.104
but you get the idea.

01:05:59.104 --> 01:06:00.454
TRAVIS: Has it been more than ten minutes?

01:06:00.454 --> 01:06:01.904
I know we want to keep a distance,

01:06:01.904 --> 01:06:04.184
but also the elements are brutal

01:06:04.184 --> 01:06:06.384
and we don't want to lose all traces of where they're going.

01:06:06.384 --> 01:06:09.298
LIAM: I probably need about five minutes, please.

01:06:09.298 --> 01:06:10.856
MARISHA: You need five minutes?
SAM: Okay.

01:06:10.856 --> 01:06:12.574
TALIESIN: We'll get moving when you're done.

01:06:12.574 --> 01:06:14.814
SAM: How long did it take us to get down here?

01:06:14.814 --> 01:06:18.144
Just a few minutes or was it like a long, long time?

01:06:18.144 --> 01:06:19.424
MATT: To get down to this point?

01:06:19.424 --> 01:06:22.194
It's probably been a number of hours.

01:06:22.194 --> 01:06:23.578
TRAVIS: We got a big-ass tunnel to go back up.

01:06:23.578 --> 01:06:25.694
SAM: Should one of us start heading up,

01:06:25.694 --> 01:06:27.534
so we can talk to Dagen ahead of time

01:06:27.534 --> 01:06:29.014
and see if he's going to come with or?

01:06:29.014 --> 01:06:30.924
TRAVIS: Oh, they're going to pass Dagen.

01:06:30.924 --> 01:06:32.214
You should send Dagen a message.

01:06:32.214 --> 01:06:34.204
LAURA: I'm going to send Dagen a message.

01:06:34.204 --> 01:06:37.294
I use my Pearl of Power to lose my last third.

01:06:37.294 --> 01:06:38.279
SAM: Tell him to hide.

01:06:38.279 --> 01:06:42.292
LAURA: Dagen, there's going to be
a group of people coming out.

01:06:42.292 --> 01:06:44.300
LIAM: Probably. Yeah, because they went unchecked.

01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:48.248
LAURA: Just tell them you're with us or hide.

01:06:49.274 --> 01:06:50.107
Be safe.

01:06:51.424 --> 01:06:52.444
We love you.

01:06:52.444 --> 01:06:54.904
MARISHA: Aw man, I really hoping he doesn't...

01:06:54.904 --> 01:06:56.364
TALIESIN: That might have been too much right there.

01:06:56.364 --> 01:06:57.300
You're going to scare him off.

01:06:57.300 --> 01:06:59.580
SAM: "Tell him he's with us or hide." Okay.

01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:01.264
Okay, those are both good options.

01:07:02.421 --> 01:07:05.744
MATT: The only response you get is, "Right."

01:07:05.744 --> 01:07:06.577
MARISHA: Okay.

01:07:06.577 --> 01:07:07.735
TRAVIS: He's savvy, he's savvy.

01:07:07.735 --> 01:07:08.568
LAURA: He's so savvy.

01:07:08.568 --> 01:07:10.118
ASHLEY: He'll be okay, he'll be okay.
TALIESIN: To the point.

01:07:12.104 --> 01:07:14.264
MARISHA: Well, if he's going around collecting

01:07:14.264 --> 01:07:19.264
giant threshold, gate stone, crest things,

01:07:19.615 --> 01:07:23.552
then, yeah, let's go get us a threshold-stone-gate thing.

01:07:23.552 --> 01:07:25.344
LAURA: And destroy it so he can't bring it back.

01:07:25.344 --> 01:07:27.194
Because that thing is scary,

01:07:27.194 --> 01:07:28.864
That city is scary.

01:07:28.864 --> 01:07:29.697
TRAVIS: What are we going to do

01:07:29.697 --> 01:07:31.022
with a two-foot wide?
SAM: We couldn't even pry a stone

01:07:31.022 --> 01:07:33.069
out of a column.
TALIESIN: What if you tried

01:07:33.069 --> 01:07:34.424
to do something with it out here

01:07:34.424 --> 01:07:36.555
where everything's kind of cuckoo?

01:07:37.505 --> 01:07:38.484
TRAVIS: Big stone.

01:07:38.484 --> 01:07:40.532
TALIESIN: Maybe that's what going home's about.

01:07:40.532 --> 01:07:41.411
LIAM: Maybe.

01:07:41.411 --> 01:07:42.244
TALIESIN: Or maybe not.

01:07:42.244 --> 01:07:44.844
LIAM: But all across this land there are fragments of a city

01:07:44.844 --> 01:07:46.184
that used to fly through the sky

01:07:46.184 --> 01:07:48.900
and we've been told about this crater

01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:50.764
that changes for everyone who looks at it.

01:07:50.764 --> 01:07:55.764
So obviously, reality in that
area is a little wibbly wobbly.

01:07:56.544 --> 01:07:59.544
And everything that is scattering this landscape

01:07:59.544 --> 01:08:01.214
probably broke off upon descent

01:08:01.214 --> 01:08:03.724
and that city plummeted into where that crater is

01:08:03.724 --> 01:08:04.964
and punched a hole through it

01:08:04.964 --> 01:08:08.704
like wet tissue paper and is somewhere else.

01:08:08.704 --> 01:08:13.036
And they're collecting a threshold crest

01:08:14.178 --> 01:08:16.403
to bring back the city proper.

01:08:16.403 --> 01:08:17.435
LAURA: Do you need more than one

01:08:17.435 --> 01:08:19.224
threshold crest to bring back a city?

01:08:19.224 --> 01:08:22.914
LIAM: Do I know that? From all I've read of the old times?

01:08:22.914 --> 01:08:25.095
MATT: You would need to, based on the size, yeah,

01:08:25.095 --> 01:08:27.947
because the threshold crest can only--

01:08:27.947 --> 01:08:30.474
it's like triangulating a position

01:08:30.474 --> 01:08:33.586
and then everything whin there can be transported.

01:08:33.586 --> 01:08:35.277
LAURA: Okay, then yeah, let's go to A5

01:08:35.277 --> 01:08:36.618
and get another one.
LIAM: You have to bedazzle--

01:08:36.618 --> 01:08:38.384
TRAVIS: A5?
LIAM: -- the bottom of the city a little bit.

01:08:38.384 --> 01:08:39.950
SAM: Oh, should we at least see which direction

01:08:39.950 --> 01:08:41.178
they set out for?
MARISHA: Let's see which direction they're going.

01:08:41.178 --> 01:08:42.615
TRAVIS: We're in A5.

01:08:42.615 --> 01:08:43.844
LAURA: "A?"!

01:08:43.844 --> 01:08:45.031
LIAM: I've got her.

01:08:45.031 --> 01:08:46.455
(whooshes)

01:08:46.455 --> 01:08:47.832
MARISHA: You've got her? You're good?
TRAVIS: You got her.

01:08:47.832 --> 01:08:48.948
LAURA: Put it in the thing.
ASHLEY: There's nothing else to see?

01:08:48.948 --> 01:08:50.056
There's nothing else to see in here?

01:08:50.056 --> 01:08:51.884
No other doors no other? No other--

01:08:51.884 --> 01:08:53.024
MATT: In the chamber you're in right now?

01:08:53.024 --> 01:08:53.857
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:08:53.857 --> 01:08:55.057
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:08:55.057 --> 01:08:56.148
TRAVIS: Oh, I have the amber.

01:08:56.148 --> 01:08:57.020
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:08:57.906 --> 01:08:59.172
TRAVIS: I have the amber, is that right?

01:08:59.172 --> 01:09:00.780
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah.

01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:01.821
LIAM: It's easier than a body.

01:09:01.821 --> 01:09:06.821
SAM: Were there any altars or boxes or anything around?

01:09:07.247 --> 01:09:08.080
MATT: Not in this chamber.

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:08.955
Not that you can see.

01:09:08.955 --> 01:09:09.788
If you want to make a perception check--

01:09:09.788 --> 01:09:10.687
TALIESIN: Oh, I was going to say I would have

01:09:10.687 --> 01:09:11.887
taken a look around, just 'cause.

01:09:11.887 --> 01:09:14.297
MATT: Sure, give it roll.

01:09:14.297 --> 01:09:15.290
TALIESIN: 29.

01:09:15.290 --> 01:09:16.173
SAM: Jesus.

01:09:16.173 --> 01:09:17.006
MATT: 29?

01:09:17.006 --> 01:09:18.932
No, I mean, beyond the bodies that

01:09:18.932 --> 01:09:20.727
have been sundered and left behind.

01:09:22.324 --> 01:09:23.975
TALIESIN: They picked everything off those bodies.

01:09:23.975 --> 01:09:25.876
SAM: No, they just killed them.
MATT: They <i>just</i> killed them.

01:09:25.876 --> 01:09:27.979
SAM: Yeah, I'm going to go pick through the bodies.

01:09:27.979 --> 01:09:30.514
LIAM: Were they glow-y? When I checked the entire room?

01:09:30.514 --> 01:09:31.347
MATT: No.

01:09:32.654 --> 01:09:35.694
You do find amongst them a number of pickaxes.

01:09:35.694 --> 01:09:39.627
They have been carving away chunks of stone.

01:09:41.544 --> 01:09:43.134
You can see some of the designs

01:09:43.134 --> 01:09:44.284
that you've seen in previous chambers

01:09:44.284 --> 01:09:47.737
as you first entered this subterranean ruin

01:09:48.614 --> 01:09:50.794
where they've carved off examples of it

01:09:50.794 --> 01:09:54.214
and managed to pull different elements

01:09:55.264 --> 01:09:58.894
to possibly sell to other individuals or bring them back,

01:09:58.894 --> 01:10:01.434
but everything seems to be just

01:10:01.434 --> 01:10:04.574
standard collections of hunks of the ruin around you.

01:10:04.574 --> 01:10:06.644
Nothing of particular worth.

01:10:06.644 --> 01:10:09.544
Or anything that was of worth might've already been taken.

01:10:12.294 --> 01:10:14.044
SAM: All right, well, then lets go.

01:10:14.044 --> 01:10:15.824
Is there any way to get out of here super fast?

01:10:15.824 --> 01:10:18.345
Do we have a Find the Path thing or something?

01:10:18.345 --> 01:10:22.293
TALIESIN: I think I saw an exit
door behind that giant spider.

01:10:22.293 --> 01:10:23.811
SAM: (blows raspberry)

01:10:23.811 --> 01:10:25.436
TALIESIN: Anyone? Okay, no. All right.

01:10:25.436 --> 01:10:27.304
LAURA: We probably just go back the way we came.

01:10:27.304 --> 01:10:28.414
SAM: All right, yeah.

01:10:28.414 --> 01:10:30.414
Do we need, like, super speed or anything?

01:10:30.414 --> 01:10:31.247
No.

01:10:31.247 --> 01:10:33.566
TALIESIN: No, I think we'll just-- the old fashion way.

01:10:33.566 --> 01:10:36.344
TRAVIS: (laughing) We don't have super speed.

01:10:36.344 --> 01:10:37.594
LIAM: That was last campaign.

01:10:38.644 --> 01:10:41.108
TRAVIS: All right, we start heading back.

01:10:41.108 --> 01:10:45.201
LAURA: Except I've used all my
Polymorph and everything so, I guess.

01:10:45.201 --> 01:10:46.673
LIAM: I haven't.

01:10:46.673 --> 01:10:47.806
LAURA: Okay.

01:10:47.806 --> 01:10:49.704
SAM: I'll bonus action super speed.

01:10:49.704 --> 01:10:51.304
MATT: Okay.

01:10:51.304 --> 01:10:52.834
So you dart through the hall,

01:10:52.834 --> 01:10:55.510
you rapidly make your way ahead of the whole group.

01:10:55.510 --> 01:10:56.604
(whooshing)

01:10:56.604 --> 01:10:58.904
Full on, like, Naruto running down the hallway.

01:11:00.704 --> 01:11:03.077
Eventually coming to the base of the pit.

01:11:04.944 --> 01:11:06.573
SAM: It's dark. I'll just wait.

01:11:06.573 --> 01:11:09.490
(laughter)

01:11:11.694 --> 01:11:13.047
You guys almost here?

01:11:14.664 --> 01:11:15.884
TRAVIS: You don't want to see if there's any more

01:11:15.884 --> 01:11:18.004
of your little oozy friends waiting?

01:11:18.004 --> 01:11:19.874
SAM: I'll look around. Oh, I still have the goggles.

01:11:19.874 --> 01:11:21.534
I'll look around and see if there's any more oozes.

01:11:21.534 --> 01:11:23.708
MATT: Make perception check.

01:11:23.708 --> 01:11:24.794
SAM: Seven.

01:11:24.794 --> 01:11:26.252
MATT: Seven? Not that you can tell.

01:11:26.252 --> 01:11:27.524
SAM: Yeah. We're fine.

01:11:27.524 --> 01:11:31.494
LAURA: I hang back as we're walking back and I talk to Beau.

01:11:31.494 --> 01:11:34.335
Do you think he's really, really gone?

01:11:34.335 --> 01:11:36.004
Or do you think he was lying

01:11:36.004 --> 01:11:37.804
and part of Molly is still in there?

01:11:39.649 --> 01:11:42.623
MARISHA: I think there's got to be
a part of Molly still in there.

01:11:42.623 --> 01:11:45.764
He said so himself that there was a fragment of him

01:11:45.764 --> 01:11:50.764
and then that fragment grew into Molly, so.

01:11:51.765 --> 01:11:53.005
LAURA: That's so weird.

01:11:54.021 --> 01:11:56.646
MARISHA: It had to be a little piece of him, you know?

01:11:56.646 --> 01:11:59.479
MARISHA: It had to be a little piece of him, you know?

01:11:59.479 --> 01:12:01.314
LAURA: Molly was so cool, though.

01:12:01.314 --> 01:12:02.832
MARISHA: I mean, look at Lucien.

01:12:02.832 --> 01:12:04.074
LAURA: He was pretty cool.

01:12:04.074 --> 01:12:06.604
MARISHA: I mean, he's kind of a charlatan just like Molly.

01:12:06.604 --> 01:12:10.252
You kind of see where there's still some similarities,

01:12:10.252 --> 01:12:12.114
You kind of see where there's still some similarities,

01:12:12.114 --> 01:12:13.964
I think that's what's tripping me up.

01:12:15.014 --> 01:12:15.847
LAURA: Yeah.

01:12:18.274 --> 01:12:21.774
MARISHA: Even him claiming about how

01:12:21.774 --> 01:12:26.644
he had no interest in his past or who he was

01:12:26.644 --> 01:12:30.752
and those were exact things that Molly said.

01:12:32.614 --> 01:12:34.194
LAURA: Makes it hurt more again.

01:12:34.194 --> 01:12:35.027
MARISHA: It does.

01:12:35.944 --> 01:12:38.457
It's like he's still dead, but now we're--

01:12:41.454 --> 01:12:44.179
LAURA: I've kind of been holding out hope as we got closer,

01:12:44.179 --> 01:12:45.170
he would--

01:12:45.170 --> 01:12:49.077
I don't know, he would see us all and

01:12:49.077 --> 01:12:50.864
remember us and--

01:12:53.471 --> 01:12:54.871
I don't know.

01:12:56.494 --> 01:12:59.935
MARISHA: It's like being gaslit by a dead guy.

01:12:59.935 --> 01:13:02.234
LAURA: (quiet sad laugh)

01:13:02.234 --> 01:13:05.084
MARISHA: Makes you feel like none of those memories are real

01:13:05.084 --> 01:13:08.342
even when you know they were.

01:13:08.342 --> 01:13:09.684
LAURA: They were.

01:13:11.434 --> 01:13:14.894
MARISHA: Molly was a real person, yeah?

01:13:14.894 --> 01:13:16.746
LAURA: Got his tarot cards to prove it.

01:13:16.746 --> 01:13:19.624
MARISHA: (chuckles)

01:13:19.624 --> 01:13:21.481
Still got his damn belt.

01:13:21.481 --> 01:13:24.288
LAURA: (chuckles)

01:13:24.288 --> 01:13:26.964
Yasha's got his coat.

01:13:26.964 --> 01:13:28.172
He was real.

01:13:31.055 --> 01:13:33.071
MARISHA: Well.

01:13:33.071 --> 01:13:35.404
I don't think this is going to get any easier.

01:13:38.778 --> 01:13:41.361
LAURA: (sighs)

01:13:43.456 --> 01:13:44.539
Okay.

01:13:45.974 --> 01:13:50.501
MARISHA: Let's go stop our dead, evil friend.

01:13:50.501 --> 01:13:51.334
LAURA: Yeah.

01:13:53.344 --> 01:13:54.684
LIAM: Okay, with me, two at a time.

01:13:54.684 --> 01:13:55.984
Who wants to go up first?

01:13:55.984 --> 01:13:57.982
I turn into a giant spider at the bottom of the pit.

01:13:57.982 --> 01:13:59.504
TRAVIS: Why a spider?!

01:13:59.504 --> 01:14:01.614
What is the matter with you?!

01:14:01.614 --> 01:14:04.681
There's so many different forms you could choose.

01:14:04.681 --> 01:14:05.514
What?

01:14:05.514 --> 01:14:07.173
MATT: With all the loud noises, Caduceus,

01:14:07.173 --> 01:14:09.332
you notice that in the nearby rocks,

01:14:09.332 --> 01:14:13.363
a familiar, black tar-like substance begins to emerge.

01:14:13.363 --> 01:14:14.674
SAM: Why don't I just lift us all up?

01:14:14.674 --> 01:14:17.014
TRAVIS: It's again.
LAURA: Oh yeah, that works, too.

01:14:17.014 --> 01:14:19.844
SAM: Yeah, I'll cast Levitation.

01:14:19.844 --> 01:14:21.177
LAURA: On all of us, you can do that?

01:14:21.177 --> 01:14:22.077
SAM: Think so.

01:14:22.077 --> 01:14:23.474
SAM: What?

01:14:23.474 --> 01:14:24.697
You're a rogue.

01:14:25.944 --> 01:14:28.204
Oh wait, no, it's only one creature

01:14:28.204 --> 01:14:31.265
or 500 pounds of objects,

01:14:31.265 --> 01:14:33.094
not creatures, apparently.

01:14:33.094 --> 01:14:34.204
Never mind.

01:14:34.204 --> 01:14:35.862
Bye, guys!

01:14:35.862 --> 01:14:38.803
(laughter)

01:14:38.803 --> 01:14:40.331
TRAVIS: Amazing!

01:14:40.331 --> 01:14:43.022
TALIESIN: I'm going to--

01:14:44.104 --> 01:14:46.604
So we've got to only move one person at a time?

01:14:46.604 --> 01:14:50.574
LAURA: Well no, I'll use my 5th-level.

01:14:50.574 --> 01:14:54.297
TALIESIN: Or I can just try,
just because I'm curious about this,

01:14:55.634 --> 01:14:57.827
yeah, I'm going to cast Antilife Shell.

01:14:58.984 --> 01:15:00.684
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: That should do it.

01:15:01.904 --> 01:15:02.884
LAURA: What is that?

01:15:04.370 --> 01:15:05.287
TRAVIS: I thought it was...

01:15:06.804 --> 01:15:08.204
TALIESIN: Yeah, unless there's a ranged attack

01:15:08.204 --> 01:15:09.404
that an oil creature can make.

01:15:09.404 --> 01:15:13.468
It's basically no living thing can get inside.

01:15:13.468 --> 01:15:15.004
That I don't want.
MATT: Yeah, for a 10-foot radius.

01:15:15.004 --> 01:15:16.844
TALIESIN: Yep.
LAURA: Oh.

01:15:16.844 --> 01:15:18.686
TALIESIN: It's not big.
MATT: You watch as Caduceus,

01:15:18.686 --> 01:15:21.784
after generating a little bit of faint energy,

01:15:21.784 --> 01:15:23.554
puts the hands up and energy expands

01:15:23.554 --> 01:15:25.644
into this dome-like bubble around him.

01:15:25.644 --> 01:15:27.064
And as you all gather close

01:15:27.064 --> 01:15:31.004
while your rogue and spider friend,

01:15:31.004 --> 01:15:33.056
with who is heading up first?

01:15:33.056 --> 01:15:36.794
LIAM: I grab Jester in mandibles and start climbing.

01:15:36.794 --> 01:15:39.261
LAURA: No, I want to hold onto your back!
Get me out of your mouth!

01:15:39.261 --> 01:15:41.422
MATT: (chuckles) You're in mandibles, sorry.

01:15:41.422 --> 01:15:42.409
LAURA: (groans)

01:15:42.409 --> 01:15:43.425
MATT: (chuckles)

01:15:43.425 --> 01:15:45.814
TRAVIS: Is it only one person at a time?

01:15:45.814 --> 01:15:48.974
LIAM: Not exactly sure how big I am as a spider.

01:15:48.974 --> 01:15:50.894
MATT: A giant spider, you'd be able to carry

01:15:50.894 --> 01:15:55.418
maybe two people and that's not--

01:15:55.418 --> 01:15:56.276
that would be your maximum

01:15:56.276 --> 01:15:57.774
and that's pushing it a little bit, I think.

01:15:57.774 --> 01:15:59.575
LIAM: Okay.
MATT: For going vertically.

01:15:59.575 --> 01:16:01.882
LIAM: A bunch of eyes just turn and stare at you, Fjord.

01:16:01.882 --> 01:16:03.174
TRAVIS: Oh fine, I'm going.

01:16:05.163 --> 01:16:06.711
(moaning)
LAURA: Fjord gets to ride on the back.

01:16:06.711 --> 01:16:09.202
TRAVIS: (moaning)
LAURA: Fjord gets to be on your back!

01:16:09.202 --> 01:16:11.234
MATT: While you guys are being carried
up the side of this tunnel,

01:16:11.234 --> 01:16:13.197
the rest of you are huddled--

01:16:13.197 --> 01:16:15.214
the rest of you being Beau and Yasha,

01:16:15.214 --> 01:16:16.524
next to Caduceus inside this bubble.

01:16:16.524 --> 01:16:19.242
As this black pudding (squelches).

01:16:19.242 --> 01:16:20.874
TALIESIN: Nope, nope, nope, nope.

01:16:20.874 --> 01:16:22.176
MARISHA: What are we going to do?
TRAVIS: On the bubble?

01:16:22.176 --> 01:16:24.895
MATT: Begins to just wrap itself around the barrier.

01:16:24.895 --> 01:16:26.864
It's held at bay.

01:16:26.864 --> 01:16:29.940
TALIESIN: Interesting thing about Antilife Shell, I believe,

01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:34.855
is that you can shoot through it and it doesn't break.

01:16:34.855 --> 01:16:37.494
And the creature can't get through.

01:16:37.494 --> 01:16:39.284
The only way a creature could get through

01:16:39.284 --> 01:16:41.294
is if I stepped towards it.

01:16:41.294 --> 01:16:42.404
MATT: Correct.

01:16:42.404 --> 01:16:43.904
TALIESIN: So I can just take potshots

01:16:43.904 --> 01:16:45.814
at this thing and doesn't matter.

01:16:45.814 --> 01:16:46.754
MATT: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Awesome.

01:16:46.754 --> 01:16:48.251
TALIESIN: All right I'm just going to take some fucking--

01:16:48.251 --> 01:16:50.885
LIAM: (as the black pudding) I just want to love you.

01:16:52.224 --> 01:16:56.224
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm just going to
gently take my time, very carefully.

01:16:56.224 --> 01:16:57.834
MATT: It lasts up to an hour.

01:16:57.834 --> 01:16:59.004
You don't need to roll damage.

01:16:59.004 --> 01:17:02.303
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm just, poke poke.

01:17:02.303 --> 01:17:03.874
(whooshes)

01:17:03.874 --> 01:17:05.364
MATT: Just Sacred Flaming it repeatedly.

01:17:05.364 --> 01:17:07.446
TALIESIN: Just Sacred Flaming.
LIAM: (black pudding dying noises)

01:17:07.446 --> 01:17:09.174
MATT: You watch as it quivers and burns

01:17:09.174 --> 01:17:10.782
and over the period of the next few minutes of so,

01:17:10.782 --> 01:17:13.547
Caduceus slowly melts down this black pudding.

01:17:13.547 --> 01:17:15.924
TALIESIN: It's not cool, it's not cool.

01:17:15.924 --> 01:17:16.904
MATT: Until, one by one, you all of you are

01:17:16.904 --> 01:17:20.074
carried to the top of this pit by Caleb.

01:17:20.074 --> 01:17:21.014
And there you find yourself,

01:17:21.014 --> 01:17:23.609
back in the familiar frozen chamber.

01:17:23.609 --> 01:17:25.446
You eventually climb your way

01:17:25.446 --> 01:17:30.446
up the incline to the previous room on its side.

01:17:30.694 --> 01:17:33.244
Finding the familiar crack opening

01:17:33.244 --> 01:17:36.074
where you first entered this ruin from the tunnel beyond.

01:17:36.074 --> 01:17:37.404
TALIESIN: I still have my little soap bubble.

01:17:37.404 --> 01:17:38.484
I'm not putting it down.

01:17:38.484 --> 01:17:39.317
MATT: You got it.

01:17:39.317 --> 01:17:41.034
LIAM: At least two or three times on the walk,

01:17:41.034 --> 01:17:42.522
a couple of spider legs just go

01:17:42.522 --> 01:17:45.027
(clicking) on Fjord's back.

01:17:45.027 --> 01:17:46.494
MATT and TALIESIN: Aw.

01:17:46.494 --> 01:17:47.524
ASHLEY: When I get up there--
LIAM: (clicking)

01:17:47.524 --> 01:17:49.190
TRAVIS: I know it's you. I know it's you.

01:17:49.190 --> 01:17:50.551
I know it's you!

01:17:50.551 --> 01:17:52.104
ASHLEY: When I get up there to Caleb,

01:17:52.104 --> 01:17:53.876
I'm going to give him some scritches on the side

01:17:53.876 --> 01:17:56.141
and I'm going to say: I'm going to eat you!

01:17:56.141 --> 01:17:58.780
(laughter)

01:17:58.780 --> 01:18:00.227
Scritchy scritchy.

01:18:01.244 --> 01:18:02.310
MATT: Perfect.

01:18:05.161 --> 01:18:08.284
LIAM: (spits)
ASHLEY: Ah!

01:18:08.284 --> 01:18:10.934
MATT: Thankfully, the spider that you saw

01:18:10.934 --> 01:18:13.555
when you first entered has not given chase.

01:18:13.555 --> 01:18:15.680
TRAVIS: Oh!
LAURA: What the eff is with that spider?

01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:19.294
MATT: You begin to climb your way out of the ruin,

01:18:19.294 --> 01:18:23.224
head up through the tiny crack,

01:18:23.224 --> 01:18:25.364
pushing through on your chest,

01:18:25.364 --> 01:18:28.454
squeezing ever so uncomfortably through with the rope,

01:18:28.454 --> 01:18:30.984
the same process that you entered through.

01:18:30.984 --> 01:18:33.004
Until eventually, you find yourself emerging once more

01:18:33.004 --> 01:18:37.424
into the steadily more and more freezing weather

01:18:37.424 --> 01:18:39.459
that awaits you in the exterior of Eiselcross.

01:18:39.459 --> 01:18:43.104
ASHLEY: We're just going to leave that spider up there?

01:18:43.104 --> 01:18:45.854
TRAVIS: Didn't we encounter a similar spider in the sewers

01:18:45.854 --> 01:18:47.494
in the very early parts of the game?

01:18:47.494 --> 01:18:48.984
LIAM: That was a phase spider.

01:18:48.984 --> 01:18:50.650
LAURA: That was a phase spider.
LIAM: It was a long time ago.

01:18:50.650 --> 01:18:52.544
TALIESIN: Wow.
SAM: Totally different spider.

01:18:52.544 --> 01:18:54.735
TRAVIS: Look, spiders suck, man, okay? They suck.

01:18:54.735 --> 01:18:55.960
ASHLEY: Yeah, but he was just looking at us.

01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:57.274
There's something in there.

01:18:57.274 --> 01:18:58.107
LAURA: I mean, probably.

01:18:58.107 --> 01:19:00.194
SAM: Could be something in there.

01:19:00.194 --> 01:19:02.344
I say as I

01:19:02.344 --> 01:19:06.402
rise up through the pit on my elevator.

01:19:07.454 --> 01:19:08.545
TRAVIS: No.
MATT: Veth is

01:19:08.545 --> 01:19:10.344
still behind in the elevator, apparently,

01:19:10.344 --> 01:19:12.894
while you guys are exiting the front of the--

01:19:12.894 --> 01:19:15.634
SAM: Hi. Where'd you guys go?

01:19:15.634 --> 01:19:17.897
It only moves 20 feet a turn.

01:19:17.897 --> 01:19:20.490
(laughter)

01:19:20.490 --> 01:19:21.990
MARISHA: Let's not lose their tracks.

01:19:23.334 --> 01:19:24.458
TRAVIS: We keep going.
MATT: Yes.

01:19:24.458 --> 01:19:27.584
Eventually, you see the familiar sight

01:19:27.584 --> 01:19:30.204
of the gray sky before you.

01:19:30.204 --> 01:19:33.464
It's later in the afternoon, Caleb is able to gauge,

01:19:33.464 --> 01:19:35.424
though the weather has remained unchanged

01:19:35.424 --> 01:19:37.994
with a very, very faint, soft snowfall.

01:19:37.994 --> 01:19:41.374
You find your way to the little antechamber

01:19:41.374 --> 01:19:44.674
where you found the remnants of a long abandoned campsite

01:19:44.674 --> 01:19:46.774
and the drow corpse that you uncovered.

01:19:48.014 --> 01:19:52.497
And carefully you step out into the open sky above.

01:19:54.084 --> 01:19:54.934
LAURA: Is Dagen there?

01:19:55.864 --> 01:19:58.130
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check.
SAM: Oh boy.

01:19:59.455 --> 01:20:01.155
Just blood everywhere.

01:20:02.243 --> 01:20:04.034
LAURA: 10.
MATT: 10?

01:20:04.034 --> 01:20:06.021
You don't see him.

01:20:06.021 --> 01:20:06.854
LIAM: Dagen?

01:20:09.328 --> 01:20:10.654
SAM: Where was he before?

01:20:10.654 --> 01:20:12.455
Where did we see him last?

01:20:12.455 --> 01:20:13.894
MATT: You saw him make his way off to

01:20:13.894 --> 01:20:15.934
one of the nearby cliffs to hide.

01:20:15.934 --> 01:20:18.339
TRAVIS: It's us, coast is clear!

01:20:18.339 --> 01:20:20.024
You can show yourself!

01:20:20.024 --> 01:20:21.674
MATT: You see a hooded head poke up.

01:20:23.274 --> 01:20:24.329
"We're good?"

01:20:24.329 --> 01:20:25.537
LAURA: Oh, yeah.
TRAVIS: Yes,

01:20:25.537 --> 01:20:28.714
did you see the party we were mentioning leave?

01:20:28.714 --> 01:20:30.714
MATT: "Hold on," and you see him back away.

01:20:30.714 --> 01:20:32.304
And then you hear-- (whoosh)

01:20:32.304 --> 01:20:33.979
as you see him in his chair just

01:20:33.979 --> 01:20:36.294
ski through and around the other side

01:20:36.294 --> 01:20:37.714
and before-- he hits the switch that

01:20:37.714 --> 01:20:39.614
puts the brakes on it before it comes to a stop

01:20:39.614 --> 01:20:43.376
and he goes, "Yeah, saw them leave.

01:20:43.376 --> 01:20:47.196
"Bunch of weird looking figures.

01:20:47.196 --> 01:20:48.934
"Do you know them?"

01:20:48.934 --> 01:20:51.124
LAURA: Not really.

01:20:51.124 --> 01:20:53.602
MARISHA: Distant acquaintances.

01:20:53.602 --> 01:20:54.435
TALIESIN: Complicated.

01:20:54.435 --> 01:20:55.973
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:20:55.973 --> 01:20:58.264
MARISHA: Did you see which direction they went?

01:20:58.264 --> 01:21:00.324
MATT: "Yeah, they went northward."

01:21:00.324 --> 01:21:01.486
TRAVIS: Northward.

01:21:01.486 --> 01:21:04.470
I think the plan is to follow at a distance, safely.

01:21:05.367 --> 01:21:06.919
MATT: "So they are friends."

01:21:06.919 --> 01:21:08.557
LAURA: (uncertain babbling)

01:21:08.557 --> 01:21:12.372
TRAVIS: More like, yet to be determined.

01:21:14.194 --> 01:21:17.569
MATT: "Right." He tightens his grip on his axe.

01:21:17.569 --> 01:21:19.104
LIAM: We're considering an alliance,

01:21:19.104 --> 01:21:21.934
but we're not quite sure how we feel about it.

01:21:21.934 --> 01:21:23.574
MATT: "Tenuous alliance."

01:21:23.574 --> 01:21:26.594
LAURA: Yeah, that we'll probably betray in the end.

01:21:26.594 --> 01:21:28.488
MATT: "Up here? Probably."
LAURA: Yeah.

01:21:28.488 --> 01:21:29.654
TRAVIS: How many times have you made it

01:21:29.654 --> 01:21:31.329
to the destination of Aeor?

01:21:32.864 --> 01:21:36.024
MATT: "Me, full journey three times."

01:21:36.024 --> 01:21:37.957
TRAVIS: How far from this point would it--

01:21:37.957 --> 01:21:40.007
how long would it take to get there?

01:21:40.007 --> 01:21:42.097
MATT: "To the actual main ruin?"

01:21:43.404 --> 01:21:44.903
"I'll put that probably in the neighborhood

01:21:44.903 --> 01:21:47.454
"of about 10 days or so.

01:21:47.454 --> 01:21:49.104
"Could be a little longer of straight shot.

01:21:49.104 --> 01:21:51.424
"Getting across that fire river

01:21:51.424 --> 01:21:54.557
"sometimes can take a day depending
on how the weather's going."

01:21:54.557 --> 01:21:57.298
SAM: If you wanted to shave off a day or two,

01:21:57.298 --> 01:21:59.764
is there a super dangerous shortcut we could

01:21:59.764 --> 01:22:02.537
take to get there before the other party did?

01:22:03.754 --> 01:22:06.074
MATT: "I mean, teleport."

01:22:06.074 --> 01:22:09.807
SAM: Oh, well, I mean, not magic.

01:22:10.687 --> 01:22:13.744
MATT: "I'm afraid you're going to have
to go the old-fashioned Dagen way.

01:22:13.744 --> 01:22:17.136
"Which is about, you know,

01:22:17.136 --> 01:22:19.464
"going at a person's pace."

01:22:19.464 --> 01:22:21.687
LAURA: We could Polymorph every day.

01:22:21.687 --> 01:22:22.862
Try to get some time

01:22:22.862 --> 01:22:23.803
shaved off by flying.
SAM: We could just

01:22:23.803 --> 01:22:25.220
stay up all night a couple nights

01:22:25.220 --> 01:22:26.825
and be exhausted.
TRAVIS: Also it's important

01:22:26.825 --> 01:22:30.224
to note what he said, lava river?

01:22:30.224 --> 01:22:32.944
It's more like a great lake.

01:22:32.944 --> 01:22:35.354
It's really, really wide.

01:22:35.354 --> 01:22:37.624
LAURA: Does it take a day to cross it?

01:22:37.624 --> 01:22:39.144
MATT: "Oh, could take a day to wait for the weather

01:22:39.144 --> 01:22:41.429
"and then having to get across is an issue."

01:22:41.429 --> 01:22:42.487
TRAVIS: It's pretty big.

01:22:42.487 --> 01:22:44.837
MATT: "Do you not know anything about the river?"

01:22:44.837 --> 01:22:47.634
LAURA: No, we just know it's a river and it's lava.

01:22:47.634 --> 01:22:49.308
TRAVIS: We see a flow shift.

01:22:49.308 --> 01:22:51.243
LAURA: Fjord bought a ring just in case.

01:22:51.243 --> 01:22:54.361
His foresight was so good.

01:22:55.502 --> 01:22:56.810
But...
ASHLEY: How--

01:22:56.810 --> 01:22:58.885
MATT: "You got a ring for a river?"

01:22:58.885 --> 01:23:02.083
TRAVIS: Oh, I have a ring for every occasion.

01:23:02.083 --> 01:23:03.234
MATT: "That's impressive."

01:23:03.234 --> 01:23:04.777
ASHLEY: How wide is the river again?

01:23:06.024 --> 01:23:09.549
MATT: "At places it can be close to a mile wide."

01:23:09.549 --> 01:23:12.132
ASHLEY: (exhales)
TRAVIS: (laughs)

01:23:13.697 --> 01:23:16.057
ASHLEY: And just straight lava?

01:23:16.057 --> 01:23:19.124
MATT: "Yeah, its one of the strange
quirks here in Eiselcross.

01:23:19.124 --> 01:23:20.504
"The flow shift you're talking about

01:23:20.504 --> 01:23:24.444
"is where it seems to emerge from the ground,

01:23:24.444 --> 01:23:26.674
"from wherever, and then divides its flow

01:23:26.674 --> 01:23:29.754
"to the north and south sides of Foren.

01:23:29.754 --> 01:23:32.327
"Weird quirk of this river,

01:23:33.664 --> 01:23:35.600
"snow doesn't melt when it touches."

01:23:36.654 --> 01:23:37.737
LIAM: What do you mean?

01:23:38.634 --> 01:23:39.784
MATT: "Meaning that's how you have to

01:23:39.784 --> 01:23:41.124
"wait for the weather to cross.

01:23:41.124 --> 01:23:42.944
"You got to wait for enough snow to gather,

01:23:42.944 --> 01:23:44.224
"so you can walk across it."

01:23:44.224 --> 01:23:46.024
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

01:23:46.024 --> 01:23:48.264
TALIESIN: That sounds like a terrible idea.

01:23:48.264 --> 01:23:51.563
LIAM: Snow covering lava.
SAM: How does that work? Is it hot?

01:23:51.563 --> 01:23:53.654
MATT: "I mean, the lava's hot, yeah, but--"

01:23:53.654 --> 01:23:55.784
SAM: The snow doesn't melt.

01:23:55.784 --> 01:23:59.589
MATT: "Like I said, Eiselcross is a very weird place.

01:23:59.589 --> 01:24:02.184
"That's why it's good to have the proper guard.

01:24:02.184 --> 01:24:04.217
"The proper person showing you around."

01:24:04.217 --> 01:24:06.535
SAM: Yeah, yeah of course.

01:24:06.535 --> 01:24:09.274
On these previous treks have you lost

01:24:09.274 --> 01:24:11.584
any of your traveling companions?

01:24:11.584 --> 01:24:13.564
MATT: "Not by my mistakes, no."

01:24:13.564 --> 01:24:14.904
(laughter)

01:24:14.904 --> 01:24:17.744
SAM: The folks that you escorted, were any of them,

01:24:17.744 --> 01:24:19.653
you know, named Sheila?

01:24:19.653 --> 01:24:21.624
LAURA: (giggles quietly)

01:24:21.624 --> 01:24:22.604
MATT: "Why do you ask?"

01:24:22.604 --> 01:24:24.354
SAM: I'm just curious.

01:24:24.354 --> 01:24:25.187
MATT: "No."

01:24:25.187 --> 01:24:26.214
SAM: Okay.

01:24:26.214 --> 01:24:28.274
MATT: "Anyway, I'm at your disposal.

01:24:28.274 --> 01:24:29.394
"You just point a direction and go.

01:24:29.394 --> 01:24:31.227
"Are we following those folks or we going somewhere else?"

01:24:31.227 --> 01:24:32.674
TRAVIS: One more question actually,

01:24:32.674 --> 01:24:35.737
there is a point demarcated as "A?".

01:24:36.864 --> 01:24:39.007
I think from our conversations with Lady DeRogna

01:24:39.007 --> 01:24:42.394
that those sites were yet to be explored,

01:24:42.394 --> 01:24:44.126
or not fully excavated.

01:24:45.226 --> 01:24:46.444
About how long would it take

01:24:46.444 --> 01:24:47.849
to get there from here, would you estimate?

01:24:47.849 --> 01:24:48.941
MATT: He looks over the map.

01:24:48.941 --> 01:24:53.121
"Yeah, from where we are now

01:24:53.121 --> 01:24:54.871
"it'll take us about eight days."

01:24:55.804 --> 01:24:57.161
LIAM: (exhales)

01:24:57.161 --> 01:24:58.574
LAURA: Eight days.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:24:58.574 --> 01:25:00.334
ASHLEY: That's to the question mark?

01:25:00.334 --> 01:25:02.559
SAM: And what's there? Have you been there?

01:25:02.559 --> 01:25:04.064
MATT: "(sighs)

01:25:04.064 --> 01:25:06.454
"I haven't been to that particular ruin site.

01:25:06.454 --> 01:25:07.764
"I've been around the area.

01:25:07.764 --> 01:25:08.914
"I know how to get there.

01:25:08.914 --> 01:25:12.404
"This map isn't too specific, so it'd be like

01:25:12.404 --> 01:25:15.564
"finding a needle in a snow-covered haystack."

01:25:15.564 --> 01:25:17.314
MARISHA: And what about from here to Aeor?

01:25:18.268 --> 01:25:19.324
TRAVIS: 10 days.

01:25:19.324 --> 01:25:21.804
LAURA: What about from question mark to Aeor?

01:25:21.804 --> 01:25:23.104
MATT: "Uh--"

01:25:23.104 --> 01:25:24.480
TRAVIS: Longer.
LIAM: It's a lot of mountains.

01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:26.374
MATT: "Probably about another 10 days or so.

01:25:26.374 --> 01:25:27.784
"About the same distance where we are now

01:25:27.784 --> 01:25:29.464
"as Aeor would be from there."

01:25:29.464 --> 01:25:31.434
TRAVIS: Through the mountains for it to be 10 days.

01:25:31.434 --> 01:25:33.122
LAURA: So if we take the chance and try to go there,

01:25:33.122 --> 01:25:36.157
we could miss them by a week or more.

01:25:36.157 --> 01:25:37.474
TALIESIN: I don't think they're going straight there.

01:25:37.474 --> 01:25:39.704
I think they're hitting more sites and more sites.

01:25:39.704 --> 01:25:42.224
MARISHA: I know, but we still don't
want to try and take the gamble

01:25:42.224 --> 01:25:44.294
by just hitting one site and they hit three

01:25:44.294 --> 01:25:46.754
and still make it to Aeor before we do.

01:25:46.754 --> 01:25:49.234
TALIESIN: That's a site that hadn't already been plundered.

01:25:49.234 --> 01:25:51.354
SAM: We have no idea what's at these sites.

01:25:51.354 --> 01:25:54.936
All we know is they're going to A2 right now, right?

01:25:54.936 --> 01:25:56.144
TRAVIS: They're going north, that's about it.

01:25:56.144 --> 01:25:58.207
Could be A2 or Aeor. They're both--

01:25:58.207 --> 01:25:59.984
SAM: And he said "Alpha and Alpha",

01:25:59.984 --> 01:26:03.264
so it's probably an Alpha, which is A2.

01:26:03.264 --> 01:26:04.097
That's to the north.

01:26:04.097 --> 01:26:05.864
So we know that there's something there.

01:26:05.864 --> 01:26:07.284
That's the only thing we know.

01:26:07.284 --> 01:26:08.934
"A?" could be nothing.

01:26:08.934 --> 01:26:09.767
TRAVIS: Could be.

01:26:09.767 --> 01:26:11.600
TALIESIN: But it could be--

01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:14.094
SAM: It's clearly not important enough for them to go there.

01:26:14.094 --> 01:26:16.173
TALIESIN: Or they don't know about it.

01:26:16.173 --> 01:26:18.394
TRAVIS: Or they may just not have
head in that direction yet.

01:26:18.394 --> 01:26:20.264
We should follow them for, like, a day.

01:26:20.264 --> 01:26:21.756
TALIESIN: But I don't think we should be behind them.

01:26:21.756 --> 01:26:24.639
I think that we should be--

01:26:24.639 --> 01:26:26.772
SAM: I think we should be before them.
TALIESIN: -- cutting them...

01:26:26.772 --> 01:26:28.044
We've got Dagen!

01:26:28.044 --> 01:26:30.644
He's the best guide in these parts.

01:26:30.644 --> 01:26:32.504
He can lead us there faster than anyone.

01:26:32.504 --> 01:26:34.294
TALIESIN: I don't think it matters
if we get there before them

01:26:34.294 --> 01:26:35.974
if they've got everything they need already.

01:26:35.974 --> 01:26:36.807
SAM: No, they don't.

01:26:36.807 --> 01:26:38.004
They're going there to get the thing that they need.

01:26:38.004 --> 01:26:40.451
We can get there first and get it.
MARISHA: Talking about going to A2.

01:26:40.451 --> 01:26:42.349
Not Aeor, but A2.

01:26:42.349 --> 01:26:43.840
SAM: Why wouldn't we go-- we got Dagen!

01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:46.424
TRAVIS: Each one of the cities have something that they need

01:26:46.424 --> 01:26:49.053
so we could go to "A?" and hold

01:26:49.053 --> 01:26:52.017
the last remaining piece like we have with Uk'otoa,

01:26:53.324 --> 01:26:56.217
or the only things they need are at A2 and Aeor.

01:26:56.217 --> 01:26:57.467
SAM: Yeah.

01:26:57.467 --> 01:27:00.319
TALIESIN: I think that there's a better chance of us not--

01:27:00.319 --> 01:27:02.484
I think running into them somewhere is a terrible idea.

01:27:02.484 --> 01:27:05.814
I think it's going to lead to a fight.

01:27:05.814 --> 01:27:08.014
And I think that there's-- the notion that

01:27:08.014 --> 01:27:09.594
there's a site that hasn't been touched?

01:27:09.594 --> 01:27:11.174
I mean, that could be anything.

01:27:11.174 --> 01:27:12.304
TRAVIS: I love a question mark.

01:27:12.304 --> 01:27:13.324
I'm having a real hard time

01:27:13.324 --> 01:27:14.744
going anywhere but the question mark.

01:27:14.744 --> 01:27:17.204
TALIESIN: I think it's a better risk.
SAM: If we spend eight days getting there

01:27:17.204 --> 01:27:22.134
and it is nothing, nothing, no interest at all,

01:27:22.134 --> 01:27:23.816
we will have fucked ourselves.

01:27:23.816 --> 01:27:25.077
TRAVIS: Yeah. It's a big miss.

01:27:25.077 --> 01:27:28.274
SAM: If we at least go where we know they are going,

01:27:28.274 --> 01:27:29.694
we know it's important.

01:27:29.694 --> 01:27:31.064
TALIESIN: Well, we won't know why because

01:27:31.064 --> 01:27:32.144
they would have already gotten there.

01:27:32.144 --> 01:27:35.283
SAM: No, we got Dagen! We're getting there first!

01:27:35.283 --> 01:27:37.132
TRAVIS: (laughs)

01:27:37.132 --> 01:27:39.625
TALIESIN: Dagen, do you feel that somehow--
SAM: We are 20 minutes behind them.

01:27:39.625 --> 01:27:41.521
TALIESIN: -- lapping these people is possible?
SAM: We have 10 days to make it up.

01:27:41.521 --> 01:27:44.207
TRAVIS: Veth, aren't you at least
intrigued by the question mark?

01:27:44.207 --> 01:27:46.483
SAM: Absolutely not! If it was important enough,

01:27:46.483 --> 01:27:49.074
it would have a number after it.

01:27:49.074 --> 01:27:50.464
MATT: "Here's my question.

01:27:50.464 --> 01:27:52.174
"If you're wanting to follow their tracks,

01:27:52.174 --> 01:27:53.924
"then there's no use in getting ahead of them

01:27:53.924 --> 01:27:55.884
"because then the tracks can't be followed,

01:27:55.884 --> 01:27:57.414
"but if we're trying to get ahead of them

01:27:57.414 --> 01:27:59.454
"because you don't care about the tracks,

01:28:00.354 --> 01:28:01.194
"we can get ahead of them."

01:28:01.194 --> 01:28:02.968
SAM: Yes!
MARISHA: We can get ahead of them?

01:28:02.968 --> 01:28:04.918
SAM: Fucking Dagen!
MATT: "I mean, I don't know who they are,

01:28:04.918 --> 01:28:05.950
"I don't know how well they travel,

01:28:05.950 --> 01:28:09.869
"but I can get you there faster than you'd be on your own."

01:28:09.869 --> 01:28:11.266
TRAVIS: Not what we needed to hear.

01:28:11.266 --> 01:28:12.099
Dammit.

01:28:12.099 --> 01:28:13.449
TALIESIN: I just am still feeling that

01:28:13.449 --> 01:28:14.597
the question mark makes sense to me.

01:28:14.597 --> 01:28:18.441
SAM: The question-- why-- we're closer to
the question mark than A2, right?

01:28:18.441 --> 01:28:19.274
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:28:19.274 --> 01:28:22.666
SAM: So, if it was that important,
they would go there first.

01:28:22.666 --> 01:28:24.891
LAURA: They don't know about it!
TALIESIN: They don't know it's there.

01:28:24.891 --> 01:28:26.941
SAM: Why wouldn't they now about it?
MATT: "The A2 on the map

01:28:26.941 --> 01:28:27.815
"from where we are right now

01:28:27.815 --> 01:28:31.154
"is about six days from us. Five, six days."

01:28:31.154 --> 01:28:32.164
TRAVIS: Oh, this map is all fucked up.

01:28:32.164 --> 01:28:36.554
ASHLEY: So A2 is north and the question mark is?

01:28:37.462 --> 01:28:38.594
TRAVIS: East, east.

01:28:38.594 --> 01:28:41.354
LIAM: I agree with Veth.

01:28:41.354 --> 01:28:43.946
Trust me, this entire landscape is probably

01:28:43.946 --> 01:28:47.644
littered with things that I am very, very curious about.

01:28:47.644 --> 01:28:51.144
MATT: "Sorry, about eight days to A2."

01:28:51.144 --> 01:28:52.814
LIAM: Why else are we here if not

01:28:52.814 --> 01:28:54.754
to figure out what Lucien is doing?

01:28:54.754 --> 01:28:56.948
And to go off in an entirely different direction

01:28:56.948 --> 01:28:59.257
for question mark, for who knows?

01:29:00.274 --> 01:29:04.854
And to potentially lose their trail entirely.

01:29:04.854 --> 01:29:06.854
SAM: Yeah, think of it like this metaphor.

01:29:06.854 --> 01:29:08.824
Say we were just walking through the snow

01:29:08.824 --> 01:29:11.934
and we saw a post sticking up out of it

01:29:11.934 --> 01:29:14.424
that could be anything.

01:29:14.424 --> 01:29:17.134
It could be jewels, it could be nothing.

01:29:17.134 --> 01:29:18.784
Should we go after it?

01:29:18.784 --> 01:29:20.964
Or should we keep walking to our destination?

01:29:20.964 --> 01:29:21.797
LAURA: Well that's a good question.

01:29:21.797 --> 01:29:23.314
Caleb, what do you think?

01:29:23.314 --> 01:29:25.074
LIAM: Well, that's worse even

01:29:25.074 --> 01:29:28.304
because that shit was directly in front of us

01:29:28.304 --> 01:29:30.731
and this is eight days march to the west.
TRAVIS: This is a metaphor.

01:29:30.731 --> 01:29:32.089
No, metaphor.
LAURA: It's a metaphor, metaphor.

01:29:32.089 --> 01:29:33.919
LIAM: I think we all know what's going on here.

01:29:33.919 --> 01:29:37.534
(laughter)

01:29:37.534 --> 01:29:38.684
SAM: I vote A2.

01:29:38.684 --> 01:29:39.934
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's vote.

01:29:39.934 --> 01:29:43.594
Show of hands to go north towards A2 or Aeor?

01:29:43.594 --> 01:29:44.814
MARISHA: Wait, what about A4?

01:29:44.814 --> 01:29:46.063
We haven't talked about A4.

01:29:46.063 --> 01:29:48.296
SAM: What?
TRAVIS: Yeah, nobody's talking about that shit.

01:29:48.296 --> 01:29:49.417
Anybody want A4?

01:29:49.417 --> 01:29:51.358
SAM: But why would A4 be any less

01:29:51.358 --> 01:29:53.309
important than "A?"?!

01:29:53.309 --> 01:29:56.401
TRAVIS: Because it's a question mark!

01:29:56.401 --> 01:29:57.557
TALIESIN: Because they may not know about it.

01:29:57.557 --> 01:29:58.964
TRAVIS: That's gamer logic, baby.

01:29:58.964 --> 01:30:00.884
SAM: We have to assume that Lucien

01:30:00.884 --> 01:30:02.290
knows all this shit already.

01:30:02.290 --> 01:30:03.614
LIAM: We are talking to you, not Travis.

01:30:03.614 --> 01:30:04.584
Now focus.

01:30:04.584 --> 01:30:05.417
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:30:07.254 --> 01:30:09.294
LIAM: We have no purpose in that direction.

01:30:09.294 --> 01:30:10.544
We don't know what that is.

01:30:10.544 --> 01:30:12.344
Are we just treasure hunters

01:30:12.344 --> 01:30:15.872
who don't care about the visions this one has had?

01:30:15.872 --> 01:30:18.695
MARISHA: It's not about treasure hunting.

01:30:18.695 --> 01:30:21.228
Let's think about this logically.

01:30:21.228 --> 01:30:22.874
We know, hang on, hang on, hang on.

01:30:22.874 --> 01:30:27.429
We know that he's looking for threshold gates, right?

01:30:27.429 --> 01:30:28.604
What are they called? Crests!

01:30:28.604 --> 01:30:29.494
That's what they're called.

01:30:29.494 --> 01:30:31.667
We know he's looking for threshold crests.

01:30:32.944 --> 01:30:34.752
We are basically gambling on if we are

01:30:34.752 --> 01:30:38.324
going to get to him sooner if we try to go to A2.

01:30:38.324 --> 01:30:39.564
It's a race.

01:30:39.564 --> 01:30:41.301
SAM: It's not a gamble.

01:30:41.301 --> 01:30:42.659
MARISHA: It's a gamble.
SAM: It's not a gamble.

01:30:42.659 --> 01:30:43.492
MARISHA: It's a gamble.

01:30:43.492 --> 01:30:45.741
SAM: Dagen <i>just</i> said it.

01:30:45.741 --> 01:30:47.322
Hundred percent sure, confidence.

01:30:47.322 --> 01:30:48.338
Dagen?

01:30:49.298 --> 01:30:51.216
MATT: "I'm real lost right now."

01:30:51.216 --> 01:30:52.574
SAM: You can get us anywhere here

01:30:52.574 --> 01:30:53.869
faster than those fuckers, right?

01:30:53.869 --> 01:30:57.023
LIAM: The gamble is going to a question mark.
MATT: "I can get there faster

01:30:57.023 --> 01:30:58.064
"than you would on your own

01:30:58.064 --> 01:31:01.297
"and based on how they're traveling on foot,

01:31:01.297 --> 01:31:03.654
"unless they're really familiar with the landscape,

01:31:03.654 --> 01:31:04.964
"they don't have me helping them out,

01:31:04.964 --> 01:31:07.144
"I could probably get you there quicker than they can."

01:31:07.144 --> 01:31:08.487
MARISHA: There's pros and cons to this,

01:31:08.487 --> 01:31:09.487
because let's think about this.

01:31:09.487 --> 01:31:12.156
TALIESIN: And what happens if they get there before us?

01:31:12.156 --> 01:31:14.014
MARISHA: Or--
SAM: Still get to see what it is.

01:31:14.014 --> 01:31:15.054
What they were doing there.

01:31:15.054 --> 01:31:16.684
What they're going to to use it for.

01:31:16.684 --> 01:31:18.464
We still get all kinds of precious information.

01:31:18.464 --> 01:31:19.844
We can race them to the next one.

01:31:19.844 --> 01:31:22.578
Or we could go to A4 while they go to "A?".

01:31:22.578 --> 01:31:24.867
We can still do the same thing.

01:31:26.104 --> 01:31:30.504
MARISHA: Or we do get there ahead of them, but barely,

01:31:30.504 --> 01:31:33.084
and then it's a fight against Lucien on the way out

01:31:33.084 --> 01:31:35.607
because we stole his shit before them.

01:31:36.584 --> 01:31:39.539
If we go to "A?", we know they're not going there

01:31:39.539 --> 01:31:41.884
and we would be basically running a solo mission.

01:31:41.884 --> 01:31:44.904
LIAM: I do not follow this logic.

01:31:44.904 --> 01:31:46.704
TRAVIS: She's explaining it.

01:31:46.704 --> 01:31:47.794
LIAM: We don't know what they're doing.

01:31:47.794 --> 01:31:51.419
TRAVIS: She's explaining it! Let her finish!
LIAM: We don't know what their purpose is with these stones.

01:31:51.419 --> 01:31:55.424
MARISHA: Well, we know that you need a lot of stones

01:31:55.424 --> 01:31:59.429
in order to teleport a giant city like this, right?

01:32:00.446 --> 01:32:03.004
They've got to be scattered literally everywhere

01:32:03.004 --> 01:32:05.044
if Aeor is as huge as it is.

01:32:05.044 --> 01:32:06.984
If "A?" is undiscovered,

01:32:06.984 --> 01:32:08.534
the likelihood that there is some sort

01:32:08.534 --> 01:32:11.504
of threshold crest there is plausible.

01:32:11.504 --> 01:32:14.314
It's really just, like, a risk management type of thing.

01:32:14.314 --> 01:32:16.424
Which one do we want to do?

01:32:16.424 --> 01:32:19.286
Do we risk doing the race and potentially

01:32:19.286 --> 01:32:21.882
having a fight ahead of time with Lucien?

01:32:21.882 --> 01:32:25.234
Or, taking a big question mark,

01:32:25.234 --> 01:32:29.574
potentially more time, but we have a pretty good idea

01:32:29.574 --> 01:32:31.964
that we're not going to maybe get into a premature fight

01:32:31.964 --> 01:32:36.084
with someone who can explode people's brains?.

01:32:36.084 --> 01:32:37.664
TALIESIN: High risk, high reward.

01:32:37.664 --> 01:32:39.794
LIAM: Okay, so say that you are correct.

01:32:39.794 --> 01:32:41.324
Let's say that there is the

01:32:41.324 --> 01:32:44.654
type of stone that they would want at question mark,

01:32:44.654 --> 01:32:49.024
but there is also a stone where they are going?

01:32:49.024 --> 01:32:50.455
LAURA: They need all of the stones.

01:32:50.455 --> 01:32:52.114
LIAM: We don't know that at all.

01:32:52.114 --> 01:32:53.464
We don't know that at all.

01:32:53.464 --> 01:32:55.274
TRAVIS: It's true.
LIAM: They could go north,

01:32:55.274 --> 01:32:57.774
get everything they need, and be gone.

01:32:57.774 --> 01:33:00.104
And we get to question mark and find a stone.

01:33:00.104 --> 01:33:03.224
Hooray, we have a stone, and they're gone.

01:33:03.224 --> 01:33:04.374
We don't know where they went,

01:33:04.374 --> 01:33:07.044
how they used it, what their plan was, nothing.

01:33:07.044 --> 01:33:08.844
TRAVIS: True, that's very true.

01:33:08.844 --> 01:33:09.894
TALIESIN: That's fair.

01:33:09.894 --> 01:33:12.824
ASHLEY: Both are very, very good points.
TALIESIN: We don't even necessarily know that

01:33:12.824 --> 01:33:14.994
they're just looking for stones; they just have one.

01:33:14.994 --> 01:33:16.347
LIAM: We have no idea what they're doing.

01:33:16.347 --> 01:33:18.751
SAM: They already could have four stones

01:33:18.751 --> 01:33:20.584
and they just needed this one extra one.

01:33:20.584 --> 01:33:22.696
Now they're going to pick up some box of gold

01:33:22.696 --> 01:33:24.262
and then they're getting out of here. We have no idea.

01:33:24.262 --> 01:33:25.864
LAURA: Should I send a message and ask them?

01:33:25.864 --> 01:33:26.697
SAM: Sure.

01:33:27.844 --> 01:33:30.134
LIAM: He's probably watching us have this conversation.

01:33:30.134 --> 01:33:31.475
TRAVIS: Oh, yes.
TALIESIN: Oh.

01:33:33.544 --> 01:33:35.578
MARISHA: That is a good point, though, because

01:33:37.169 --> 01:33:38.954
he said to follow him.

01:33:38.954 --> 01:33:40.824
Once again, he always said

01:33:40.824 --> 01:33:43.843
even if we decide to go a different path,

01:33:43.843 --> 01:33:46.174
we can always try and check in on him.

01:33:46.174 --> 01:33:47.254
Say, "Hey."

01:33:47.254 --> 01:33:49.952
We know that he'll be looking back, but.

01:33:49.952 --> 01:33:51.164
TRAVIS: We could also just see what he does

01:33:51.164 --> 01:33:53.334
for a half day's travel, a day's travel.

01:33:53.334 --> 01:33:54.744
If he goes north, he's going north.

01:33:54.744 --> 01:33:58.744
If he starts to turn, because there is a land mass here,

01:33:58.744 --> 01:34:00.620
then he's not going north.

01:34:00.620 --> 01:34:01.519
SAM: Okay.
MARISHA: Also, even if

01:34:01.519 --> 01:34:02.774
we just follow him for half a day,

01:34:02.774 --> 01:34:05.374
maybe Dagen can get a good bead on him

01:34:05.374 --> 01:34:07.314
and then we could be a little bit more sure

01:34:07.314 --> 01:34:09.214
if we know that we could outpace them.

01:34:10.385 --> 01:34:11.544
MATT: "I don't mean to pry in business.

01:34:11.544 --> 01:34:14.802
"It's really not what you hired me for, but--"

01:34:14.802 --> 01:34:16.960
TALIESIN: Please.

01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:19.594
MATT: "Are y'all trying to teleport a city?"

01:34:19.594 --> 01:34:20.781
TALIESIN: Oh, boy, that's a conversation.

01:34:20.781 --> 01:34:23.044
LAURA: Well, <i>we're not</i>.

01:34:23.044 --> 01:34:26.164
You know, but, who knows, other people might be

01:34:26.164 --> 01:34:27.744
and that could be dangerous.

01:34:27.744 --> 01:34:30.386
MARISHA: Why, do you know about teleporting cities?

01:34:30.386 --> 01:34:34.089
MATT: "No, it just seems like a lot of city to teleport."

01:34:34.089 --> 01:34:36.824
LIAM: Dagen, it's all speculation and myth and legend.

01:34:36.824 --> 01:34:38.834
You must know, it abounds in this place.

01:34:38.834 --> 01:34:40.254
There's so many strange mysteries,

01:34:40.254 --> 01:34:42.494
magic doesn't work properly.

01:34:42.494 --> 01:34:44.404
MATT: "I mean, yeah, there's all sorts of mysteries."

01:34:44.404 --> 01:34:45.537
LIAM: Tall tales.

01:34:47.264 --> 01:34:49.647
MATT: "Completely. It's just a lot of city to teleport."

01:34:51.894 --> 01:34:53.444
SAM: You talking about Aeor?

01:34:53.444 --> 01:34:54.794
MATT: "Yeah, the main ruin."

01:34:54.794 --> 01:34:57.047
MARISHA: They're going to need a lot of threshold crests.

01:34:58.559 --> 01:35:00.914
SAM: Have you been to other major cities around the world?

01:35:00.914 --> 01:35:02.467
Can you compare it in size?

01:35:03.884 --> 01:35:07.834
MATT: "I'd say, just the central ruin there,

01:35:07.834 --> 01:35:10.874
"the crater that's filled with ice that's over the ruin

01:35:10.874 --> 01:35:13.107
"is probably about, I don't know,

01:35:14.755 --> 01:35:16.830
"a handful of miles across."

01:35:18.365 --> 01:35:19.973
MARISHA: "Handful of miles."

01:35:20.854 --> 01:35:22.314
TALIESIN: More than a couple.

01:35:22.314 --> 01:35:23.963
MATT: "I mean, the ruin there,

01:35:23.963 --> 01:35:28.094
"you can see there's some of the tower

01:35:28.094 --> 01:35:30.034
"still poking through the ice itself.

01:35:30.034 --> 01:35:31.314
"That's how the ruin was found.

01:35:31.314 --> 01:35:33.964
"So, it's a big city.

01:35:33.964 --> 01:35:37.420
"At least as much of a chunk that resides there."

01:35:40.078 --> 01:35:41.484
MARISHA: We have a few other options.

01:35:41.484 --> 01:35:43.304
Not to muddy this up,

01:35:43.304 --> 01:35:45.257
but if we're looking for information,

01:35:46.644 --> 01:35:49.733
Vess, whenever we can talk to her again.

01:35:49.733 --> 01:35:52.618
LIAM: Couple days.

01:35:52.618 --> 01:35:54.464
MARISHA: Cobalt Soul knew nothing.

01:35:54.464 --> 01:35:56.244
And they said all the pieces and everything

01:35:56.244 --> 01:35:58.124
that'd been uncovered from these areas

01:35:58.124 --> 01:36:00.474
all laid in the hands of the Cerberus Assembly.

01:36:01.694 --> 01:36:04.224
They also said that it's been an arms race

01:36:04.224 --> 01:36:07.457
between the Cerberus Assembly and the Dynasty.

01:36:10.094 --> 01:36:11.457
Could call up some of our old friends.

01:36:11.457 --> 01:36:13.111
MARISHA: Maybe Essek knows something about it.

01:36:13.111 --> 01:36:16.444
MARISHA: Correct.
TALIESIN: That's a really good idea.

01:36:16.444 --> 01:36:20.014
MARISHA: They might know, because this is Vess' map.

01:36:20.014 --> 01:36:22.384
We already ran into one pillar with one

01:36:22.384 --> 01:36:25.864
giant green emerald that we couldn't yank from it.

01:36:25.864 --> 01:36:29.634
That's her map of the excavation sites that she knows.

01:36:29.634 --> 01:36:31.064
Essek and the Dynasty could have

01:36:31.064 --> 01:36:33.264
a whole other excavation map with

01:36:33.264 --> 01:36:35.004
a whole bunch of other "A?"s on it.

01:36:35.004 --> 01:36:38.427
TALIESIN: They probably would want to hear
about what happened to their crew.

01:36:38.427 --> 01:36:40.624
TRAVIS: Unless this is Lucien's map.

01:36:40.624 --> 01:36:42.254
And she just had it.

01:36:42.254 --> 01:36:44.245
TALIESIN: Oh, this is a good plan.

01:36:44.245 --> 01:36:47.604
SAM: So we're going to start walking after the party

01:36:47.604 --> 01:36:49.604
and during that day that we're following them

01:36:49.604 --> 01:36:53.597
we can make some phone calls, or you know, calls.

01:36:55.844 --> 01:36:56.894
I just invented phones, canon.

01:36:56.894 --> 01:36:59.014
LIAM: Similarly, I was considering

01:36:59.014 --> 01:37:02.344
contacting Astrid and Eadwulf.

01:37:02.344 --> 01:37:04.764
TALIESIN: Let's start with--
TRAVIS: Ooh.

01:37:04.764 --> 01:37:06.912
SAM: Do they know about this stuff?

01:37:06.912 --> 01:37:08.297
TRAVIS: They could.

01:37:08.297 --> 01:37:10.925
LIAM: I have to assume Astrid knows a lot.

01:37:10.925 --> 01:37:12.724
LAURA: Do you think you can trust them, Caleb?

01:37:12.724 --> 01:37:13.557
LIAM: No.

01:37:14.714 --> 01:37:15.547
TRAVIS: Even Astrid?

01:37:17.378 --> 01:37:20.524
TALIESIN: I feel like the Dynasty will ask fewer questions.

01:37:20.524 --> 01:37:21.424
LAURA: At least Essek.

01:37:21.424 --> 01:37:22.504
TALIESIN: Maybe.

01:37:22.504 --> 01:37:24.062
MARISHA: And you're sure?
TALIESIN: Maybe?

01:37:24.062 --> 01:37:26.254
MARISHA: She was working with Trent, and it seems like

01:37:26.254 --> 01:37:30.073
Vess kept a lot of shit secret from Trent and Ludinus

01:37:30.073 --> 01:37:32.004
and the rest of the Cerberus Assembly.

01:37:33.478 --> 01:37:35.436
I don't know if she's that--

01:37:35.436 --> 01:37:37.884
I don't know if this reaches her pay grade.

01:37:37.884 --> 01:37:38.774
TRAVIS: Should we walk and talk?

01:37:38.774 --> 01:37:39.944
MARISHA: Let's walk and talk.

01:37:39.944 --> 01:37:41.210
Yeah, we were walking and talking.

01:37:41.210 --> 01:37:43.857
LAURA: We're walking and talking.

01:37:43.857 --> 01:37:46.154
LIAM: I think she knows quite a bit.

01:37:46.154 --> 01:37:50.662
I think that she's been trained

01:37:50.662 --> 01:37:53.520
to take over things.

01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:57.914
But they're not the only option, to be sure.

01:37:59.694 --> 01:38:01.457
MATT: "So we're moving, all right."

01:38:02.344 --> 01:38:06.775
TALIESIN: We've been walking 20 minutes, I don't know what--

01:38:06.775 --> 01:38:08.284
MATT: "Fucking walkers."

01:38:09.564 --> 01:38:12.394
So yeah, so you guys continue your path now.

01:38:12.394 --> 01:38:15.294
Here the weather is not too harsh.

01:38:16.824 --> 01:38:19.624
Heading northward, following the tracks,

01:38:19.624 --> 01:38:22.824
Dagen has a very strong lead on the tracks he left behind.

01:38:22.824 --> 01:38:25.127
They're not trying to cover them by any means.

01:38:26.014 --> 01:38:30.764
But nevertheless, you're a little late in the day,

01:38:30.764 --> 01:38:32.654
but let's go ahead and roll to see

01:38:32.654 --> 01:38:34.834
if anything transpires today.

01:38:34.834 --> 01:38:36.216
Who wants to roll?

01:38:36.216 --> 01:38:37.443
LIAM: I think maybe you rolled last.

01:38:37.443 --> 01:38:38.464
TALIESIN: I rolled last.

01:38:38.464 --> 01:38:39.737
MARISHA: Is it me? Okay.

01:38:39.737 --> 01:38:41.529
TALIESIN: Ruin everything.
SAM: What is it, a ten?

01:38:41.529 --> 01:38:44.695
MATT: A d20.
TRAVIS: "Ruin everything."

01:38:44.695 --> 01:38:45.954
TALIESIN: I'm counting on you.

01:38:45.954 --> 01:38:49.120
MARISHA: Don't say that! Don't count on me!

01:38:49.974 --> 01:38:51.042
19!

01:38:51.042 --> 01:38:52.258
SAM: Hey.
TRAVIS: That's the worst one.

01:38:52.258 --> 01:38:53.974
TALIESIN: Weirdly, the higher it goes, the worse it is.

01:38:53.974 --> 01:38:55.434
MARISHA: Yeah, it's-- Yeah.

01:38:55.434 --> 01:38:56.600
LAURA: Possibly.

01:38:56.600 --> 01:38:57.832
MATT: Roll a d8 for me.

01:38:57.832 --> 01:38:59.274
ALL: Oh!
TRAVIS: Oh, boy.

01:38:59.274 --> 01:39:01.239
What the fuck, Marisha?

01:39:01.239 --> 01:39:02.422
SAM: Good job.
LIAM: Great.

01:39:02.422 --> 01:39:05.014
SAM: Maybe it's to see how many gems we discovered.

01:39:05.014 --> 01:39:06.844
LIAM: As if there's not enough going on today.

01:39:06.844 --> 01:39:08.035
MARISHA: Seven.
TALIESIN: Knew it.

01:39:08.035 --> 01:39:09.938
LIAM: Oh, that's the worst one!

01:39:09.938 --> 01:39:13.744
TRAVIS: Second from the top.

01:39:13.744 --> 01:39:14.577
TALIESIN: Knew it.

01:39:14.577 --> 01:39:16.116
MATT: The weather begins to grow harsher.

01:39:16.116 --> 01:39:19.791
(groaning)
(laughter)

01:39:19.791 --> 01:39:21.484
MARISHA: Why, though?!

01:39:21.484 --> 01:39:23.527
MATT: At a certain point, Dagen shouts out,

01:39:24.471 --> 01:39:26.628
"I see something ahead!"

01:39:26.628 --> 01:39:28.603
MARISHA: No, you don't!

01:39:28.603 --> 01:39:33.360
MATT: "No, I do. I very plainly see something ahead."

01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:34.285
MARISHA: No!

01:39:35.718 --> 01:39:38.518
MATT: "I think it might be your party.

01:39:40.871 --> 01:39:41.744
"Maybe."

01:39:42.991 --> 01:39:44.931
And you see, as he comes up on the hill,

01:39:44.931 --> 01:39:47.405
his grinding wheels bringing them up.
MARISHA: They're all dead.

01:39:47.405 --> 01:39:48.888
LAURA: Yeah!

01:39:48.888 --> 01:39:50.194
SAM: End of campaign.

01:39:50.194 --> 01:39:54.374
MATT: "Whatever this is, it didn't
come to a positive conclusion,"

01:39:54.374 --> 01:39:55.934
and he sleds off this hill

01:39:55.934 --> 01:39:57.554
and as you begin to follow behind

01:39:57.554 --> 01:39:58.814
you can see that there are

01:39:58.814 --> 01:40:01.774
a number of bodies scattered a little ways off.
MARISHA: Another altercation?

01:40:01.774 --> 01:40:03.564
Oh boy.

01:40:03.564 --> 01:40:06.004
TALIESIN: I'm going to carefully keep an eye out

01:40:06.004 --> 01:40:07.401
for what's around this thing.

01:40:07.401 --> 01:40:08.974
It feels very trappy to me.

01:40:08.974 --> 01:40:10.497
MATT: Okay.

01:40:10.497 --> 01:40:11.547
LAURA: It's trappy.

01:40:11.547 --> 01:40:12.464
SAM: (funny voice) Hi, I'm Trappy.

01:40:12.464 --> 01:40:13.586
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:40:13.586 --> 01:40:15.684
LIAM: Don't forget to check for traps.

01:40:15.684 --> 01:40:16.587
TRAVIS: Don't pay any attention to me.

01:40:16.587 --> 01:40:17.595
TALIESIN: 21.

01:40:20.224 --> 01:40:24.764
MATT: You don't see anything at the moment of issue.

01:40:24.764 --> 01:40:25.634
It is getting darker.

01:40:25.634 --> 01:40:27.544
The light is beginning to fade.

01:40:27.544 --> 01:40:31.842
From the sky above, night does begin to loom.

01:40:31.842 --> 01:40:34.334
But as the snowfall begins to increase,

01:40:34.334 --> 01:40:36.274
the wind begins to blow a bit,

01:40:36.274 --> 01:40:38.184
you glance forward and see that this group of bodies

01:40:38.184 --> 01:40:41.955
is not the Tomb Takers that you are pursuing.

01:40:41.955 --> 01:40:46.114
In fact, at this glance, they are long frozen.

01:40:46.114 --> 01:40:47.294
At least the bodies appear to be.

01:40:47.294 --> 01:40:50.614
There is a flair of ice across the skin

01:40:50.614 --> 01:40:53.984
and they are still in the snow, partially covered,

01:40:53.984 --> 01:40:58.224
and elements of bodies, like limbs, stuck in rigor mortis

01:40:58.224 --> 01:41:00.536
in this frozen state poking through.

01:41:00.536 --> 01:41:02.119
LIAM: Oh, closer look, closer look.

01:41:02.119 --> 01:41:02.952
LAURA: Yeah.

01:41:02.952 --> 01:41:04.564
TALIESIN: Detect undead just for fun.

01:41:04.564 --> 01:41:06.922
MATT: Okay. You want to make a--

01:41:06.922 --> 01:41:08.594
LIAM: Yeah, I want to see if I can ascertain

01:41:08.594 --> 01:41:10.024
what kind of a group they were,

01:41:10.024 --> 01:41:11.457
if they've got anything interesting on them.

01:41:11.457 --> 01:41:12.412
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:41:12.412 --> 01:41:13.854
LIAM: I am a thief.

01:41:15.177 --> 01:41:17.624
TRAVIS: Detect undead, you said?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:41:17.624 --> 01:41:18.457
LIAM: 16.

01:41:19.824 --> 01:41:20.807
MATT: All right, 16.

01:41:22.084 --> 01:41:26.027
You find actually some money.

01:41:27.094 --> 01:41:28.337
About 15 platinum.

01:41:29.244 --> 01:41:31.742
341 gold.

01:41:31.742 --> 01:41:34.062
You find a diamond worth 250 gold pieces.

01:41:34.062 --> 01:41:36.013
TRAVIS: Yo!
TALIESIN: Winner winner.

01:41:36.013 --> 01:41:36.846
TRAVIS: Clutch.
SAM: Is that enough?

01:41:36.846 --> 01:41:37.896
Does it have to be 300?

01:41:37.896 --> 01:41:39.662
TRAVIS: Does that do one of the things?

01:41:39.662 --> 01:41:42.080
MARISHA: But you can, like, add to it, right?

01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:43.938
SAM: Can you glue two diamonds together?

01:41:43.938 --> 01:41:44.843
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah!

01:41:44.843 --> 01:41:46.217
LAURA: I don't think that's quite how it works.

01:41:46.217 --> 01:41:47.644
TALIESIN: But diamond powder, on the other hand--

01:41:47.644 --> 01:41:50.976
LAURA: Diamond powder we can use for other things, yes.

01:41:50.976 --> 01:41:51.954
LIAM: The diamond worth how much?

01:41:51.954 --> 01:41:52.794
MATT: 250 gold.

01:41:52.794 --> 01:41:54.410
LIAM: I just pass that off to you.

01:41:54.410 --> 01:41:55.243
LAURA: Oh.

01:41:55.243 --> 01:41:59.273
MATT: And a small chunk of blue material,

01:42:00.223 --> 01:42:01.594
not too dissimilar from what you

01:42:01.594 --> 01:42:04.075
saw the Tomb Takers leave with.

01:42:04.075 --> 01:42:05.984
LAURA: (gasps)
LIAM: Oh, interesting.

01:42:05.984 --> 01:42:06.817
MARISHA: Wait, what?

01:42:06.817 --> 01:42:08.782
LAURA: The blue was, like, one
of the threshold crests crushed.

01:42:08.782 --> 01:42:10.907
LIAM: -- piece of what was in the ceiling.

01:42:13.474 --> 01:42:14.307
MATT: What were you doing?

01:42:14.307 --> 01:42:15.140
TALIESIN: Detect undead.

01:42:15.140 --> 01:42:16.684
MATT: Detect undead.

01:42:16.684 --> 01:42:19.224
You get, of the six bodies that are there,

01:42:19.224 --> 01:42:23.254
six faint, undead sources from inside the frozen corpses.

01:42:23.254 --> 01:42:25.275
TALIESIN: Yeah, they're still kicking around.

01:42:25.275 --> 01:42:26.658
SAM: What?
LIAM: Oh, interesting.

01:42:26.658 --> 01:42:28.094
SAM: Maybe we should leave?

01:42:28.094 --> 01:42:29.054
LIAM: Well, they're not doing anything.

01:42:29.054 --> 01:42:31.544
And I knock on one of their heads.

01:42:31.544 --> 01:42:32.754
MATT: As you're finished looking,

01:42:32.754 --> 01:42:35.564
you look up at the frozen body that's there in the snow

01:42:35.564 --> 01:42:40.234
that you finished breaking off the mostly frozen

01:42:40.234 --> 01:42:42.604
packs at their side, you can see the eyes.

01:42:42.604 --> 01:42:46.404
One of them (ice cracking) looks towards you.

01:42:46.404 --> 01:42:47.237
LIAM: Oh, hello.

01:42:47.237 --> 01:42:49.675
MATT: "(gurgling)"

01:42:49.675 --> 01:42:50.508
LIAM: Yeah.

01:42:52.454 --> 01:42:53.797
Life is pretty rough.

01:42:55.478 --> 01:42:57.274
MATT: He's just looking at you with the one eye.

01:42:58.594 --> 01:43:00.224
LIAM: Oh, <i>bubbe</i>.

01:43:00.224 --> 01:43:01.934
(patting)

01:43:01.934 --> 01:43:03.834
You can't use this anymore, thank you.

01:43:05.344 --> 01:43:06.557
Let's just walk faster.

01:43:07.664 --> 01:43:09.308
We're faster than them.

01:43:09.308 --> 01:43:12.544
TRAVIS: But do we want to ask where that material came from?

01:43:12.544 --> 01:43:14.304
Maybe they found their own threshold crest

01:43:14.304 --> 01:43:17.684
and now Lucien's group has it?
TALIESIN: Probably not very talkative at this point.

01:43:17.684 --> 01:43:19.553
TRAVIS: Can we kill them and then ask them?

01:43:19.553 --> 01:43:20.386
MARISHA: (laughing) Yeah.

01:43:20.386 --> 01:43:23.274
TALIESIN: Once they're undead, it's-- I don't know if

01:43:23.274 --> 01:43:25.364
that's really a thing you want to mess with.

01:43:25.364 --> 01:43:26.774
TRAVIS: All right, fair.

01:43:26.774 --> 01:43:28.471
TALIESIN: I don't want to.

01:43:28.471 --> 01:43:30.106
MARISHA: I'm still going to pick-- can I pick--

01:43:30.106 --> 01:43:31.254
wait, did someone do that already?

01:43:31.254 --> 01:43:33.548
Picked up the piece of threshold?
TRAVIS: Oh, I think Caleb has it.

01:43:33.548 --> 01:43:35.456
MARISHA: You did? Okay, okay, okay, good.

01:43:37.561 --> 01:43:42.064
MATT: There's a very faint blue glow you can see

01:43:42.064 --> 01:43:44.474
emanating from inside the throat of one of them.

01:43:44.474 --> 01:43:45.524
ASHLEY: Blue glow?

01:43:45.524 --> 01:43:48.795
LAURA: Ooh, like they ate some of it?
LIAM: Inside the throat?

01:43:48.795 --> 01:43:51.045
MATT: One of them you see the mouth is frozen open a bit

01:43:51.045 --> 01:43:52.764
and you can this very faint blue glow on the inside.

01:43:52.764 --> 01:43:53.934
MARISHA: Oh, well let's go for that.

01:43:53.934 --> 01:43:56.359
LIAM: Oh, yeah. I start prying on the jaw.

01:43:56.359 --> 01:43:58.027
MARISHA: Yeah, I reach in.

01:43:59.104 --> 01:44:00.954
TRAVIS: I think they're still moving.

01:44:00.954 --> 01:44:01.787
MARISHA: Yeah, I think so,. too.

01:44:01.787 --> 01:44:03.404
MATT: Well, you reach in...

01:44:03.404 --> 01:44:05.677
LAURA: Oh, no. Why would you...?

01:44:06.619 --> 01:44:09.475
MATT: Your hand immediately turns extremely cold.

01:44:09.475 --> 01:44:10.584
I need you to make a constitution saving throw for me.

01:44:10.584 --> 01:44:11.787
MARISHA: Super cold!
SAM: Oh no!

01:44:13.524 --> 01:44:14.664
LAURA: This is so dumb.

01:44:14.664 --> 01:44:17.184
(laughter)
TRAVIS: I do a swan dive!

01:44:17.184 --> 01:44:18.977
MARISHA: Okay, 15.

01:44:18.977 --> 01:44:21.118
MATT: 15, okay.

01:44:21.118 --> 01:44:24.634
You pull back and your hand is numb.

01:44:24.634 --> 01:44:27.204
Like it is just-- we're talking funny bone,

01:44:27.204 --> 01:44:30.834
sitting on it for an hour, bloodless numb.

01:44:30.834 --> 01:44:32.124
There was nothing to grab.

01:44:32.124 --> 01:44:35.605
It just felt like this cold,

01:44:35.605 --> 01:44:38.614
empty space in its throat.

01:44:38.614 --> 01:44:40.804
You didn't sense a source of the glow.

01:44:40.804 --> 01:44:43.094
But you see some of the other bodies now.

01:44:43.094 --> 01:44:45.634
You can see between the teeth also

01:44:45.634 --> 01:44:48.922
this blue glow beginning to slightly--
MARISHA: Maybe we should just go.

01:44:48.922 --> 01:44:52.473
I don't think it's a thing.
MATT: -- brighten within their visible orifices.

01:44:52.473 --> 01:44:55.223
LIAM: We'll check this out later.
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're going.

01:44:56.224 --> 01:44:57.248
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:44:57.248 --> 01:44:58.323
LIAM: Quick walking.

01:44:58.323 --> 01:45:00.994
MATT: Dagen's like, "Are you satisfied?

01:45:00.994 --> 01:45:01.874
"Let's fucking go."

01:45:01.874 --> 01:45:03.957
LIAM: Yeah. Power walk, people.

01:45:03.957 --> 01:45:04.790
MATT: All right.

01:45:06.124 --> 01:45:07.984
So you continue on for the next hour

01:45:07.984 --> 01:45:11.394
and a half or so before nightfall hits.

01:45:11.394 --> 01:45:15.127
It is pitch black and the weather has worsened.

01:45:17.184 --> 01:45:18.751
Dagen's sitting here going,

01:45:18.751 --> 01:45:20.584
"I mean, I can make a camp, but

01:45:20.584 --> 01:45:24.567
"do you still have that pretty--?"
LIAM: Oh no, Dagen, Dagen, Dagen,

01:45:24.567 --> 01:45:25.564
we're not going to do that.

01:45:25.564 --> 01:45:28.672
SAM: At least wait and make sure that they're making camp.

01:45:28.672 --> 01:45:30.847
We should get eyes on--

01:45:30.847 --> 01:45:34.094
I mean, are we within eyeshot of Lucien's party?

01:45:34.094 --> 01:45:36.994
MATT: Not eyeshot yet, but you're following the path.

01:45:36.994 --> 01:45:38.520
SAM: Let's follow until they stop.

01:45:38.520 --> 01:45:40.024
MARISHA: I agree.

01:45:40.024 --> 01:45:42.048
MATT: "Okay."
LAURA: How would we know?

01:45:42.048 --> 01:45:44.374
SAM: They'll light a fire, I assume.

01:45:44.374 --> 01:45:45.324
MARISHA: What if they don't stop?

01:45:45.324 --> 01:45:46.415
TALIESIN: Or don't need to.

01:45:46.415 --> 01:45:47.857
SAM: Then we'll go up and look.

01:45:47.857 --> 01:45:50.736
LAURA: I could just scry on them.
SAM: We're not enemies.

01:45:50.736 --> 01:45:53.276
Sure, it's going to be dark, but sure.

01:45:54.492 --> 01:45:55.492
LAURA: It only takes a few minutes.

01:45:55.492 --> 01:45:56.585
LIAM: Yeah, I think you should.

01:45:56.585 --> 01:45:58.834
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to scry.

01:45:58.834 --> 01:46:01.332
On...

01:46:01.332 --> 01:46:02.744
Cree.

01:46:02.744 --> 01:46:04.135
MATT: On Cree, okay.

01:46:04.135 --> 01:46:05.718
LAURA: Wait, wait, wait.

01:46:06.874 --> 01:46:08.624
Before I do that,

01:46:08.624 --> 01:46:11.919
I'm going to cast Enhance Ability

01:46:11.919 --> 01:46:14.910
on myself for perception checks.

01:46:14.910 --> 01:46:19.910
on myself for perception checks.

01:46:20.094 --> 01:46:20.927
MATT: Okay.

01:46:21.824 --> 01:46:23.474
All righty.

01:46:23.474 --> 01:46:25.374
And so then you sit down for a second.

01:46:27.454 --> 01:46:29.947
Let me go ahead and check one thing for the scry.

01:46:36.494 --> 01:46:37.494
Okay, yep.

01:46:43.594 --> 01:46:45.659
As you all are walking through the snow a bit,

01:46:45.659 --> 01:46:47.777
you tell everyone stop for a moment.

01:46:47.777 --> 01:46:49.344
LAURA: Stop for a moment.

01:46:49.344 --> 01:46:51.524
MATT: You begin to prepare your spell,

01:46:51.524 --> 01:46:53.614
bringing out various spells that are required

01:46:53.614 --> 01:46:56.847
and as you concentrate and complete

01:46:56.847 --> 01:46:58.344
the casting of the scrying spell,

01:46:58.344 --> 01:47:02.154
you feel the arms of the Traveler reach

01:47:02.154 --> 01:47:03.294
under your shoulders from behind

01:47:03.294 --> 01:47:06.197
and lift your consciousness from you for a moment.

01:47:08.584 --> 01:47:12.075
You see dark snow,

01:47:12.075 --> 01:47:14.041
lightless, black cold.

01:47:14.041 --> 01:47:17.714
And you can sense the cold, but it doesn't make you cold.

01:47:17.714 --> 01:47:21.099
It's just acknowledging the temperature.

01:47:22.774 --> 01:47:27.174
A little ways ahead, you catch sight

01:47:27.174 --> 01:47:32.174
of a small fire tucked into a hill

01:47:32.644 --> 01:47:35.754
where a portion of it's been dug out.

01:47:35.754 --> 01:47:39.254
And there, you can see the troop of the five of them

01:47:39.254 --> 01:47:43.414
all gathered around this flame, staring into it.

01:47:43.414 --> 01:47:47.312
There you see Cree is currently in the process

01:47:47.312 --> 01:47:50.935
of going through materials in her pouch.

01:47:52.474 --> 01:47:53.677
Pack, if you will.

01:47:56.174 --> 01:47:57.774
There's not much conversation at the moment.

01:47:57.774 --> 01:48:00.599
They're just getting themselves ready for a night's rest.

01:48:00.599 --> 01:48:03.394
LAURA: Do they look like they're cold?

01:48:03.394 --> 01:48:05.941
MATT: Right now up against the fire?

01:48:05.941 --> 01:48:08.344
Cree doesn't appear to be that freezing.

01:48:08.344 --> 01:48:10.294
But they're pretty close to the flames.

01:48:14.954 --> 01:48:17.104
Interesting point, the flames are there, but there's not--

01:48:17.104 --> 01:48:18.554
what you do see at the outskirts,

01:48:18.554 --> 01:48:22.295
there's no kindle, there's no thing that is catching,

01:48:22.295 --> 01:48:25.697
there's just fire being produced between them all.

01:48:28.634 --> 01:48:31.174
LAURA: There's no conversation happening?

01:48:31.174 --> 01:48:33.466
MATT: Not at the moment.
SAM: They're just getting ready for bed.

01:48:36.577 --> 01:48:38.484
MATT: About a moment passes before

01:48:39.834 --> 01:48:42.517
Cree's eyes fade over, red.

01:48:44.924 --> 01:48:46.494
And the head turns up in the direction

01:48:46.494 --> 01:48:50.304
of your particular scrying position

01:48:50.304 --> 01:48:53.724
before you hear both Lucien and Cree's voice

01:48:53.724 --> 01:48:56.074
simultaneously overlapping come through to you.

01:48:59.442 --> 01:49:01.165
"So you're keeping up well enough."

01:49:03.254 --> 01:49:04.900
LAURA: Can you hear me?

01:49:04.900 --> 01:49:07.441
Yes? Can you hear me?

01:49:07.441 --> 01:49:09.344
I don't know you can hear me.

01:49:09.344 --> 01:49:10.374
Probably can.

01:49:10.374 --> 01:49:12.694
MATT: Not reacting to your voice at all.

01:49:12.694 --> 01:49:13.944
Just seems to be peering.

01:49:15.164 --> 01:49:17.177
"I hope you're staying close.

01:49:17.177 --> 01:49:20.554
"There's a lot to see when we get there

01:49:20.554 --> 01:49:25.530
"and it'd be a real shame if you petered off the trail.

01:49:28.424 --> 01:49:31.124
"I'm curious what <i>you</i> want out of this.

01:49:33.656 --> 01:49:37.839
"I understand that you all

01:49:37.839 --> 01:49:40.039
"lie with such confidence.

01:49:43.307 --> 01:49:44.457
"I admire that.

01:49:44.457 --> 01:49:47.914
"It's gotten me through, well, most of my previous life.

01:49:49.494 --> 01:49:54.494
"But there are still

01:49:54.835 --> 01:49:56.685
"challenges with a mortal body.

01:49:57.774 --> 01:50:00.495
"Such as the cold."

01:50:06.087 --> 01:50:08.529
He just stares back at you.

01:50:10.300 --> 01:50:11.764
Is there anything in particular you want to do

01:50:11.764 --> 01:50:15.283
or look for while you're scrying?

01:50:15.283 --> 01:50:16.649
LAURA: Um.

01:50:21.444 --> 01:50:23.174
No, I don't think so.

01:50:23.174 --> 01:50:25.884
SAM: We got what we came for.

01:50:25.884 --> 01:50:27.667
LAURA: I guess--

01:50:29.584 --> 01:50:32.544
Do they have any emotion, any of the other four?

01:50:32.544 --> 01:50:36.914
Do they seem like they talk

01:50:36.914 --> 01:50:41.064
when Lucien's not talking through them?

01:50:41.064 --> 01:50:42.914
Do they talk to each other?

01:50:42.914 --> 01:50:44.214
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:50:45.894 --> 01:50:47.811
LAURA: Ooh, I get advantage!

01:50:49.664 --> 01:50:51.139
(groans)

01:50:53.141 --> 01:50:54.616
12.

01:50:54.616 --> 01:50:55.449
MATT: 12?

01:50:57.251 --> 01:51:02.251
You hear mutterings of conversation

01:51:02.582 --> 01:51:04.994
happening outside of the one that is currently

01:51:04.994 --> 01:51:07.053
being put in your direction.

01:51:07.053 --> 01:51:07.886
LAURA: Okay.

01:51:10.114 --> 01:51:11.864
MATT: So you get a sense that it isn't,

01:51:11.864 --> 01:51:15.837
like, one unified consciousness controlling five bodies,

01:51:17.904 --> 01:51:21.864
but the minute that Cree/Lucien

01:51:21.864 --> 01:51:23.344
begins to acknowledge you,

01:51:23.344 --> 01:51:25.444
the rest of the conversation falls silent.

01:51:30.830 --> 01:51:31.830
LAURA: All right.

01:51:33.422 --> 01:51:35.987
Guess that's everything then.

01:51:36.874 --> 01:51:37.707
MATT: Okay.

01:51:41.174 --> 01:51:43.744
SAM: Did you get a sense for how far away they are?

01:51:43.744 --> 01:51:45.798
LAURA: They're a little ways ahead.

01:51:45.798 --> 01:51:47.234
SAM: Should we catch up a little bit more,

01:51:47.234 --> 01:51:51.404
so we're, like, you know, a few hundred meters away

01:51:51.404 --> 01:51:54.604
before we make our--
LAURA: I think we're not that far, you know?

01:51:54.604 --> 01:51:55.744
SAM: Okay.

01:51:55.744 --> 01:52:00.385
LAURA: He did say that it would be
a shame if we left the trail.

01:52:00.385 --> 01:52:03.785
It almost seemed like-- I don't know.

01:52:03.785 --> 01:52:05.472
MARISHA: He wants us to follow him?

01:52:08.917 --> 01:52:10.476
LAURA: What if it's reverse psychology?

01:52:10.476 --> 01:52:11.964
SAM: Yeah, keep your enemies closer?

01:52:11.964 --> 01:52:13.684
TRAVIS: Keeps us exactly where he--

01:52:13.684 --> 01:52:16.277
TALIESIN: Keeps us from looking at any of the other sites.

01:52:17.254 --> 01:52:20.837
LIAM: They hold all the cards and they're toying with us,

01:52:20.837 --> 01:52:23.094
and we either play along to their game

01:52:23.094 --> 01:52:26.157
or we fuck off and do something totally else.

01:52:27.254 --> 01:52:28.514
SAM: I feel like if we're going to make camp,

01:52:28.514 --> 01:52:30.054
we should be within an eyeshot of them.

01:52:30.054 --> 01:52:30.887
TRAVIS: I agree.
SAM: That way,

01:52:30.887 --> 01:52:32.304
when we wake up, we don't have to scry

01:52:32.304 --> 01:52:33.664
to see if they've left already.

01:52:33.664 --> 01:52:34.614
TRAVIS: Especially if there's a fire.

01:52:34.614 --> 01:52:37.564
We should be able to see that from a reasonable distance.

01:52:37.564 --> 01:52:38.397
MARISHA: Let's do it.

01:52:38.397 --> 01:52:39.744
LAURA: I mean, I know what to look for.

01:52:39.744 --> 01:52:41.604
That hill that they're dug into.

01:52:41.604 --> 01:52:43.277
MATT: "Okay, let's keep pushing on then for a bit,

01:52:43.277 --> 01:52:46.684
"just to keep an eye out along with mine.

01:52:46.684 --> 01:52:48.767
"It's always good to have more eyes on the horizon."

01:52:50.144 --> 01:52:51.424
SAM: I'm watching.
LAURA: If we run into anything,

01:52:51.424 --> 01:52:53.814
I'm out of spells, so I won't be able to

01:52:53.814 --> 01:52:55.144
help us very much.

01:52:55.144 --> 01:52:56.319
Only got a couple left.

01:52:56.319 --> 01:52:57.924
SAM: Beau, do you want your goggles back?

01:52:57.924 --> 01:52:59.231
MARISHA: Yeah, I do.
SAM: All right.

01:52:59.231 --> 01:53:00.631
MARISHA: Thank you.

01:53:00.631 --> 01:53:01.744
MATT: All right, perception check?

01:53:01.744 --> 01:53:03.222
TALIESIN: Yep.

01:53:03.222 --> 01:53:04.791
SAM: So good!

01:53:04.791 --> 01:53:06.834
TRAVIS: Do you want anyone to assist you?
SAM: What? Who said that?

01:53:06.834 --> 01:53:07.782
LAURA: Yeah.

01:53:08.840 --> 01:53:10.565
MATT: What you got?
TALIESIN: 30.

01:53:10.565 --> 01:53:12.084
TRAVIS: (laughs)

01:53:12.084 --> 01:53:13.344
MATT: Actually, we would be at disadvantage,

01:53:13.344 --> 01:53:14.434
because you do not have darkvision,

01:53:14.434 --> 01:53:16.044
and it is in the middle of the night, so one more time.

01:53:16.044 --> 01:53:17.129
TRAVIS: Do you want some assistance?

01:53:17.129 --> 01:53:19.614
SAM: We got four party members that don't have darkvision?

01:53:19.614 --> 01:53:21.894
Is that right?
TALIESIN: Damn it. Too late.

01:53:21.894 --> 01:53:22.904
SAM: That's crazy.

01:53:22.904 --> 01:53:24.034
TALIESIN: 14.

01:53:24.034 --> 01:53:25.708
MATT: 14, okay.
LIAM: We have Light, though.

01:53:25.708 --> 01:53:26.541
SAM: Yeah.

01:53:27.513 --> 01:53:31.684
MATT: About another 45 or so minutes, eventually you begin

01:53:31.684 --> 01:53:34.187
to pick up the sight of a tiny, distant flame.

01:53:36.251 --> 01:53:37.084
LAURA: There it is.

01:53:37.084 --> 01:53:38.944
MATT: Getting close enough to a point of comfort,

01:53:38.944 --> 01:53:42.144
you can see some movement across the fire.

01:53:42.144 --> 01:53:45.814
So at least you know that it is a campsite,

01:53:45.814 --> 01:53:48.174
and based on what you've seen, fairly close

01:53:48.174 --> 01:53:50.714
to the one that you saw in your scry.

01:53:50.714 --> 01:53:52.654
TALIESIN: We'll definitely lose them if we take a point of--

01:53:52.654 --> 01:53:54.394
if we are exhausted tomorrow.

01:53:54.394 --> 01:53:57.134
So I think camping is a good idea.

01:53:57.134 --> 01:53:58.394
TALIESIN: The dome or the?

01:53:58.394 --> 01:53:59.381
TALIESIN: No.

01:53:59.381 --> 01:54:00.214
LIAM: Not the dome.

01:54:00.214 --> 01:54:01.094
SAM: The hotel--

01:54:01.094 --> 01:54:03.917
LIAM: It's so cold. I shove the wand down into the snow,

01:54:03.917 --> 01:54:08.667
and spend a minute opening a portal to our abode.

01:54:11.454 --> 01:54:12.314
SAM: Let's do it.

01:54:12.314 --> 01:54:16.374
Jester, you can still send messages

01:54:16.374 --> 01:54:19.001
from inside his hotel?

01:54:19.001 --> 01:54:19.834
LAURA: Yeah.

01:54:22.154 --> 01:54:23.234
MATT: All right.

01:54:23.234 --> 01:54:24.904
You all make your way into the tower,

01:54:24.904 --> 01:54:26.744
prepare yourselves for an evening's rest.

01:54:26.744 --> 01:54:29.814
What would you like to do while you're there for the night?

01:54:29.814 --> 01:54:30.647
SAM: Hot chocolate.

01:54:31.492 --> 01:54:34.016
ASHLEY and MARISHA: Hot chocolate.

01:54:34.016 --> 01:54:37.462
ASHLEY: Hot chocolate in the fire, in the library?

01:54:37.462 --> 01:54:38.864
There is a fire there, right?

01:54:38.864 --> 01:54:39.834
A fireplace?

01:54:39.834 --> 01:54:41.184
LIAM: Fires all over the place.

01:54:42.833 --> 01:54:45.154
TALIESIN: He's finally out of
earshot, too, we can speak freely.

01:54:45.154 --> 01:54:47.597
LIAM: Yes. Well, probably.

01:54:47.597 --> 01:54:48.430
Probably.

01:54:48.430 --> 01:54:50.564
TALIESIN: Probably.
LIAM: Probably.

01:54:50.564 --> 01:54:54.144
I pull a sash in the corner of the entry hall

01:54:54.144 --> 01:54:58.588
and a cat pops out of the little archway hole.

01:54:58.588 --> 01:55:00.330
Gretchen, um,

01:55:00.330 --> 01:55:02.384
would you make lots of pies?

01:55:02.384 --> 01:55:04.584
I'd like to have shepherd's pie for everyone for dinner,

01:55:04.584 --> 01:55:08.148
and then also a variety of dessert pies as well.

01:55:08.148 --> 01:55:09.844
Okay?

01:55:09.844 --> 01:55:11.937
Hot, please.
MATT: (mrrows)

01:55:11.937 --> 01:55:14.315
One darts off into the wall and vanishes.

01:55:14.315 --> 01:55:16.180
LIAM: (cat noises)

01:55:18.564 --> 01:55:20.586
Okay, you want to unpack all of that?

01:55:20.586 --> 01:55:22.337
And I start to float up through.

01:55:23.171 --> 01:55:27.181
MATT: Dagen's like, "Oh yeah, all right," (whooshes)

01:55:27.181 --> 01:55:29.494
and just starts hovering up into the upper part of the tower

01:55:29.494 --> 01:55:31.392
going, "Weee!"

01:55:34.444 --> 01:55:39.444
TRAVIS: I'll pull Jester aside and say:

01:55:40.024 --> 01:55:42.799
You mentioned that

01:55:42.799 --> 01:55:47.734
Cree or Lucien was speaking to you directly as well?

01:55:47.734 --> 01:55:48.567
LAURA: Yeah.

01:55:50.684 --> 01:55:55.224
It's almost like when he takes control,

01:55:55.224 --> 01:55:58.364
obviously it's like he's got full,

01:55:58.364 --> 01:56:01.444
his consciousness overwhelms the other people, you know?

01:56:01.444 --> 01:56:03.795
He was speaking to me from Cree.

01:56:05.364 --> 01:56:09.054
TRAVIS: Does it seem like he's
keying in on you in particular?

01:56:09.054 --> 01:56:10.874
I know it's you that's been scrying,

01:56:10.874 --> 01:56:13.634
but when we see someone scrying on us,

01:56:13.634 --> 01:56:17.114
we only see a representation of the spell.

01:56:17.114 --> 01:56:18.444
We don't see the person.

01:56:18.444 --> 01:56:21.514
And I'm sure that Lucien is much more important, but...

01:56:22.944 --> 01:56:24.684
I'm sure it's just coincidence,

01:56:24.684 --> 01:56:29.684
but since we're not on the sea,

01:56:29.859 --> 01:56:32.284
would you want to wear this?

01:56:32.284 --> 01:56:36.654
And I take out the
Amulet of Proof Against Detection and Location.

01:56:36.654 --> 01:56:38.074
I don't know if it'll work.

01:56:38.074 --> 01:56:40.593
Caleb gave it to me because we've--

01:56:40.593 --> 01:56:43.304
I've seemed to have a beacon on me every time

01:56:43.304 --> 01:56:45.804
we go on the open water, but we're far from water.

01:56:46.814 --> 01:56:49.277
It might provide some protection

01:56:49.277 --> 01:56:51.493
if we're going to keep checking in on him.

01:56:53.317 --> 01:56:56.660
LAURA: I mean, it's worth a try.

01:56:59.554 --> 01:57:02.711
He's met all of us so he could potentially scry

01:57:02.711 --> 01:57:06.824
on anyone, I guess, now, but maybe it'll keep me

01:57:06.824 --> 01:57:08.797
from being seen if I scry on him.

01:57:10.146 --> 01:57:12.484
I don't know how it all works.

01:57:12.484 --> 01:57:14.972
TRAVIS: I guess we'd find out the next time we did it.

01:57:14.972 --> 01:57:15.805
LAURA: Yeah.

01:57:17.563 --> 01:57:19.124
Thank you.

01:57:19.124 --> 01:57:20.664
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:57:20.664 --> 01:57:24.605
Just in case it's not a coincidence.

01:57:26.254 --> 01:57:27.537
LAURA: It's also creepy.

01:57:30.649 --> 01:57:33.052
He did say that he kind of knew me, right?

01:57:34.794 --> 01:57:35.627
TRAVIS: Did he?

01:57:35.627 --> 01:57:36.699
LAURA: When we got there,

01:57:36.699 --> 01:57:39.024
he said he hadn't met anyone except for me.

01:57:41.424 --> 01:57:44.514
The only way he would have known this is from the scriess.

01:57:44.514 --> 01:57:48.794
I never met him without the group, you know?

01:57:48.794 --> 01:57:50.394
TRAVIS: Yes, it's what I--

01:57:50.394 --> 01:57:51.854
LAURA: Weird.

01:57:51.854 --> 01:57:53.924
You think he sees me like a little fish eye lens,

01:57:53.924 --> 01:57:58.924
like, looking through a little ball and my face.

01:57:59.054 --> 01:58:01.454
TRAVIS: What do you think?
What does your face do when you scry?

01:58:01.454 --> 01:58:03.864
LAURA: I don't know. You would know better than me.

01:58:03.864 --> 01:58:05.694
TRAVIS: Very. You're just--

01:58:05.694 --> 01:58:08.394
LAURA: Like, just open mouth? That is not flattering.

01:58:08.394 --> 01:58:09.534
TRAVIS: Checked out.

01:58:11.769 --> 01:58:15.284
LAURA: Next time, just do me a favor, close my jaw.

01:58:15.284 --> 01:58:20.284
I just want to look less stupid while I'm doing it, okay?

01:58:20.534 --> 01:58:21.874
TRAVIS: I will try.

01:58:21.874 --> 01:58:24.474
It's one of Beau's favorite things, though, to watch.

01:58:25.329 --> 01:58:29.657
LAURA: Oh, well, I guess don't
take the joy away from her, then.

01:58:29.657 --> 01:58:31.335
TRAVIS: Okay.
LAURA: Okay.

01:58:31.335 --> 01:58:34.780
MARISHA: (whispering) I'm just tossing ball bearings.

01:58:34.780 --> 01:58:37.845
TRAVIS: They're just hitting her lips and causing bruises,

01:58:37.845 --> 01:58:38.942
solid metal.
MATT: Cracking the teeth.

01:58:38.942 --> 01:58:40.484
TRAVIS: Yeah!

01:58:40.484 --> 01:58:43.335
They're not blueberries. (laughs)

01:58:43.335 --> 01:58:44.169
(crack) Ugh!

01:58:44.169 --> 01:58:45.435
LAURA: Ah! My tooth!

01:58:46.784 --> 01:58:49.024
TRAVIS: What happened to my face while I was scrying?

01:58:49.024 --> 01:58:51.674
LAURA: I can take off the Charm of Plant Command

01:58:51.674 --> 01:58:52.507
right now, right?

01:58:52.507 --> 01:58:55.314
Because not seeing a lot of plants around here.

01:58:55.314 --> 01:58:58.051
TRAVIS: Not much, no, I don't think so.

01:58:58.051 --> 01:59:00.832
And, obviously, it is Caleb's, but--

01:59:00.832 --> 01:59:03.154
LAURA: Should I ask him if it's okay?

01:59:03.154 --> 01:59:05.304
TRAVIS: He gave it to me to use it.

01:59:05.304 --> 01:59:07.697
You seem to need it more than I do right now.

01:59:09.588 --> 01:59:11.547
LAURA: Okay.

01:59:12.771 --> 01:59:13.721
TRAVIS: And just be careful.

01:59:13.721 --> 01:59:18.721
I don't like the possibility of him keying in on you,

01:59:18.764 --> 01:59:21.104
or using that connection between the two of you

01:59:21.104 --> 01:59:22.474
to manipulate something.

01:59:22.474 --> 01:59:24.104
His magic seemed strange.

01:59:24.104 --> 01:59:26.504
I don't know that much, Caleb would know more,

01:59:26.504 --> 01:59:30.257
but he seems to be playing by a different set of rules.

01:59:30.257 --> 01:59:31.590
LAURA: He really does.

01:59:35.857 --> 01:59:36.857
TRAVIS: All right.

01:59:38.704 --> 01:59:40.277
More adventures tomorrow.

01:59:41.618 --> 01:59:42.451
What?

01:59:44.884 --> 01:59:45.927
LAURA: How are you?

01:59:47.144 --> 01:59:48.994
I know that's a stupid question, but,

01:59:50.594 --> 01:59:53.789
you know, Avantika showed back up, and

01:59:56.199 --> 01:59:58.524
she tried to pull you under water

01:59:58.524 --> 02:00:02.394
and, you know, she's like, you guys had a thing,

02:00:02.394 --> 02:00:05.384
and it must've been weird to see her, like,

02:00:05.384 --> 02:00:07.607
kind of dead and stuff.

02:00:08.464 --> 02:00:09.804
Was it weird?

02:00:09.804 --> 02:00:11.476
You killed her again.

02:00:11.476 --> 02:00:14.609
TRAVIS: Yeah, it was weird. It was weird, for sure.

02:00:16.594 --> 02:00:18.167
I wasn't expecting that.

02:00:20.714 --> 02:00:21.727
I'm all right.

02:00:24.454 --> 02:00:27.844
It feels like I keep trying to start newer chapters

02:00:27.844 --> 02:00:30.074
in my life and leave the old stuff behind,

02:00:30.074 --> 02:00:34.184
and then it just keeps popping up.

02:00:34.184 --> 02:00:38.684
It feels like it's hard to pursue something new

02:00:38.684 --> 02:00:41.457
when the past is not dealt with.

02:00:43.791 --> 02:00:46.099
LAURA: Well, do we need to deal with the past?

02:00:48.874 --> 02:00:49.707
TRAVIS: I think so.

02:00:53.074 --> 02:00:53.907
I want to.

02:00:55.584 --> 02:00:59.772
I feel like I need to close all of that before...

02:01:03.877 --> 02:01:07.384
LAURA: Anytime you want to, I can-- I can scry, you know,

02:01:07.384 --> 02:01:09.994
I can try to search for anyone again.

02:01:09.994 --> 02:01:11.574
I know we've talked about it before,

02:01:11.574 --> 02:01:15.897
but if it would help, I could do it.

02:01:18.424 --> 02:01:19.257
TRAVIS: Right.

02:01:21.653 --> 02:01:26.119
I actually-- I put a bounty out on...

02:01:28.003 --> 02:01:28.994
Sabian.

02:01:29.935 --> 02:01:31.484
LAURA: When?

02:01:31.484 --> 02:01:32.394
How?

02:01:32.394 --> 02:01:36.635
TRAVIS: Well, back on the island--

02:01:36.635 --> 02:01:39.524
the famous bounty hunter out of Nicodranas--

02:01:39.524 --> 02:01:40.357
LAURA: Oh.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:01:40.357 --> 02:01:42.574
LAURA: Yeah. Oh!

02:01:42.574 --> 02:01:47.071
TRAVIS: I just figured, give them
a task with their mind being--

02:01:47.071 --> 02:01:48.642
LAURA: How will you know if they find him?

02:01:48.642 --> 02:01:52.394
TRAVIS: I think they are going to
communicate by magical means?

02:01:52.394 --> 02:01:53.744
LAURA: Do they have the ability?

02:01:53.744 --> 02:01:54.824
Should I send a message?

02:01:54.824 --> 02:01:56.844
I know them. Maybe I can send a message and be like:

02:01:56.844 --> 02:01:58.264
Hey, did you find Sabian?

02:01:58.264 --> 02:02:00.154
Should we be worried?

02:02:00.154 --> 02:02:01.444
Is Sabian dead?

02:02:01.444 --> 02:02:02.487
What's going on?

02:02:03.884 --> 02:02:05.267
TRAVIS: Sure. Yeah.

02:02:05.267 --> 02:02:06.417
LAURA: You want me to do it?

02:02:06.417 --> 02:02:07.967
TRAVIS: Yeah.
LAURA: Oh, okay.

02:02:08.974 --> 02:02:09.807
Okay.

02:02:12.284 --> 02:02:13.932
All I have left is a 6th-level spell,

02:02:13.932 --> 02:02:16.471
but we're going to sleep, so I'm going to use

02:02:16.471 --> 02:02:18.770
(laughing) my 6th-level spell to send a message.

02:02:18.770 --> 02:02:20.987
SAM: (pigeon coo) We're not going to sleep. (coos)

02:02:20.987 --> 02:02:23.254
LAURA: What?
SAM: Okay.

02:02:23.254 --> 02:02:24.620
TRAVIS: We're not going to sleep?

02:02:24.620 --> 02:02:26.520
SAM: Weren't we going to call Essek and stuff?

02:02:28.300 --> 02:02:30.184
(laughter)

02:02:30.184 --> 02:02:31.384
LAURA: I mean--

02:02:31.384 --> 02:02:33.114
SAM: Wasn't that the whole point of this?

02:02:33.114 --> 02:02:34.579
LAURA: I've also got a 7th-level spell.

02:02:34.579 --> 02:02:35.742
SAM: Okay. (coos)

02:02:35.742 --> 02:02:36.812
Go ahead and do it.

02:02:36.812 --> 02:02:39.318
LIAM: That was floated. I don't think it was decided on.

02:02:39.318 --> 02:02:40.151
TRAVIS: It was a good idea.

02:02:40.151 --> 02:02:42.120
LAURA: (coos) Find me later, let me know about that

02:02:42.120 --> 02:02:44.354
because I forgot. (coos)

02:02:44.354 --> 02:02:46.080
TRAVIS: I used up all my minutes on myself,

02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:47.324
but I have to call.

02:02:47.324 --> 02:02:48.638
MATT: (laughs)

02:02:48.638 --> 02:02:52.378
SAM: And then he was going to call Astrid and stuff.

02:02:52.378 --> 02:02:54.815
TRAVIS: (coos)
SAM: Okay.

02:02:57.704 --> 02:03:00.037
LAURA: What was their name again?

02:03:01.044 --> 02:03:02.409
TRAVIS: Oh, the bounty hunter?

02:03:02.409 --> 02:03:03.826
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Um...

02:03:04.993 --> 02:03:05.959
LIAM: Shamp--

02:03:07.134 --> 02:03:08.234
SAM: Shampoo.

02:03:08.234 --> 02:03:09.067
TRAVIS: Kotho?

02:03:09.067 --> 02:03:10.050
LAURA: Kotho.
MATT: Kotho.

02:03:10.050 --> 02:03:10.883
TRAVIS: Kotho.

02:03:10.883 --> 02:03:12.216
LAURA: Nice. Okay, I'm going to

02:03:12.216 --> 02:03:13.804
send a message.
TRAVIS: Notes!

02:03:13.804 --> 02:03:14.747
MARISHA: They work!

02:03:14.747 --> 02:03:15.680
LAURA: To Kotho.

02:03:15.680 --> 02:03:16.688
MARISHA: Tried and true.

02:03:18.734 --> 02:03:21.834
LAURA: Hi, I'm here with Fjord.

02:03:21.834 --> 02:03:23.474
He hired you.

02:03:23.474 --> 02:03:24.894
Wondering if you found Sabian.

02:03:24.894 --> 02:03:26.497
What's going on there.

02:03:29.174 --> 02:03:30.074
Is he dead?

02:03:30.074 --> 02:03:31.517
Is he alive?

02:03:33.266 --> 02:03:36.576
Just... (high-pitched) let's...

02:03:38.968 --> 02:03:40.433
(very high-pitched) be!

02:03:42.400 --> 02:03:45.834
MATT: It's the high-pitched squeak
at the end that really makes it.

02:03:45.834 --> 02:03:47.211
ASHLEY: You're like (high pitched mumbles).

02:03:47.211 --> 02:03:49.181
MARISHA: Just someone on the verge of a panic attack.

02:03:49.181 --> 02:03:50.674
MATT: Yep, yep.

02:03:50.674 --> 02:03:53.764
There's a brief moment before Kotho responds.

02:03:53.764 --> 02:03:54.597
"Ah.

02:03:56.424 --> 02:04:01.344
"Tell Fjord indeed Sabian has been found.

02:04:03.174 --> 02:04:06.507
"Acquisition will take care and time,

02:04:06.507 --> 02:04:10.684
"Acquisition will take care and time,

02:04:10.684 --> 02:04:12.977
"as he resides in Darktow."

02:04:13.951 --> 02:04:16.527
MARISHA: Oh!

02:04:18.038 --> 02:04:20.454
(whispers) We was there.

02:04:20.454 --> 02:04:23.169
TRAVIS: We got fucking banished in less than a day!

02:04:23.169 --> 02:04:24.414
MARISHA: A day, yeah!
(laughter)

02:04:24.414 --> 02:04:25.797
MATT: Yup.
MARISHA: But you know...

02:04:26.814 --> 02:04:28.971
Maybe that only lasts like a year, you know, like when

02:04:28.971 --> 02:04:31.787
you get caught shoplifting.
LIAM: Maybe he got there after us?

02:04:31.787 --> 02:04:33.103
TALIESIN: Six weeks.
TRAVIS: You never know.

02:04:33.103 --> 02:04:34.819
You never know.
LIAM: Maybe the day after we left?

02:04:34.819 --> 02:04:37.344
MARISHA: Just need turnover to happen, you know?

02:04:37.344 --> 02:04:38.914
LAURA: Whoops.

02:04:38.914 --> 02:04:40.884
TRAVIS: No, no, no, no, no whoops. That's great.

02:04:40.884 --> 02:04:42.074
That's great.

02:04:42.074 --> 02:04:46.367
I-- that's totally distracting, but that's great.

02:04:47.596 --> 02:04:48.972
Thank you.
LAURA: You're welcome.

02:04:48.972 --> 02:04:50.995
Well, now you know!

02:04:50.995 --> 02:04:51.828
TRAVIS: Thank you.

02:04:51.828 --> 02:04:53.161
LAURA: You're welcome.

02:04:53.161 --> 02:04:55.111
I'm glad I could help.

02:04:57.234 --> 02:04:58.900
TRAVIS: That was very nice of you.

02:04:58.900 --> 02:05:00.950
LAURA: It's just a spell.

02:05:00.950 --> 02:05:02.142
Easy to do.

02:05:05.248 --> 02:05:08.848
TRAVIS: I will think about that all night.

02:05:08.848 --> 02:05:09.681
LAURA: (giggles)

02:05:11.220 --> 02:05:12.136
Okay.

02:05:13.564 --> 02:05:15.483
Oh, you know who else I should call?

02:05:15.483 --> 02:05:16.764
Essek!

02:05:16.764 --> 02:05:17.597
TRAVIS: Oh, that's true.

02:05:17.597 --> 02:05:20.154
I do believe the group was talking about--

02:05:20.154 --> 02:05:21.644
LAURA: Yeah, maybe I should go to the group,

02:05:21.644 --> 02:05:24.064
and sit in front of the fire. We can talk to Essek.
TRAVIS: I think that's a great idea.

02:05:24.064 --> 02:05:25.322
TRAVIS: I'll race you to the top!

02:05:25.322 --> 02:05:26.903
Up!
LAURA: Up!

02:05:26.903 --> 02:05:31.596
(laughter)

02:05:31.596 --> 02:05:32.596
SAM: Oh my god.

02:05:34.114 --> 02:05:35.444
TALIESIN: Irritatingly adorable.

02:05:35.444 --> 02:05:36.554
MATT: I know, I know, right?

02:05:36.554 --> 02:05:38.237
TALIESIN: It's just like ugh, gross.

02:05:39.134 --> 02:05:40.409
MATT: All righty.

02:05:40.409 --> 02:05:43.794
So you guys race your way up the tower together

02:05:43.794 --> 02:05:44.627
to the rest of the group,

02:05:44.627 --> 02:05:47.249
and easy enough for you to regather, so.

02:05:49.854 --> 02:05:51.160
LAURA: Do we need to talk to Essek?

02:05:52.134 --> 02:05:54.951
SAM: That was one of the things we had floated doing.

02:05:54.951 --> 02:05:58.260
Why we're following for a couple of days, yeah.

02:05:58.260 --> 02:05:59.704
LIAM: Have a seat, have some pie.

02:05:59.704 --> 02:06:01.905
Please, we can't eat all of this on our own.

02:06:01.905 --> 02:06:03.282
LAURA: What kind of pie?

02:06:03.282 --> 02:06:05.166
LIAM: Yes.
LAURA: (excited noise)

02:06:05.166 --> 02:06:07.273
SAM: Is there--
MATT: "But whatever you don't finish just--

02:06:07.273 --> 02:06:08.106
"I can go ahead

02:06:08.106 --> 02:06:08.939
"and take the scraps--"
SAM: Is there pecan?

02:06:08.939 --> 02:06:11.245
MATT: "-- if you don't mind."
LIAM: Yes, yeah.

02:06:11.245 --> 02:06:14.386
TRAVIS: Pecan chocolate pie?
LAURA: I basically make a full pie

02:06:14.386 --> 02:06:16.402
out of all different slices of pie.

02:06:16.402 --> 02:06:19.076
SAM: Ooh, that's nice.
TRAVIS: Whoa.

02:06:19.076 --> 02:06:20.901
Yeah.
MATT: "This place is ridiculous.

02:06:20.901 --> 02:06:22.404
"You know that, right?"

02:06:22.404 --> 02:06:24.784
LIAM: Yeah, but I'm making for a lot of lost time

02:06:24.784 --> 02:06:26.194
sleeping on roads and stuff.

02:06:26.194 --> 02:06:27.857
So it balances out.

02:06:27.857 --> 02:06:28.690
MATT: "I'd say yeah.

02:06:28.690 --> 02:06:29.913
"I guess so am I now, huh?"
LAURA: He was--

02:06:29.913 --> 02:06:31.359
LIAM: Yeah.
LAURA: -- so stinky.

02:06:31.359 --> 02:06:35.054
Like, he was just so stinky. Like, when we first met him,

02:06:35.054 --> 02:06:37.744
like, he'd been on the road for a long time.

02:06:37.744 --> 02:06:39.862
LIAM: Now the stink is just on the inside.

02:06:39.862 --> 02:06:41.564
MATT: "Mmm.

02:06:41.564 --> 02:06:43.191
"I can see that on you.

02:06:44.414 --> 02:06:46.464
"Crazy thing, I'm usually allergic,

02:06:46.464 --> 02:06:48.411
"but none of these cats seem to bother me."

02:06:48.411 --> 02:06:49.244
SAM and LAURA: Oh!

02:06:49.244 --> 02:06:50.077
LIAM: Oh, yeah.

02:06:50.077 --> 02:06:51.734
Well, these are special.

02:06:51.734 --> 02:06:53.746
This is the specialist (whooshes).

02:06:53.746 --> 02:06:54.814
Frumpkin on the table.

02:06:54.814 --> 02:06:57.254
Frumpkin, go say hello to Dagen, please.

02:06:57.254 --> 02:06:58.784
MATT: "Hi, Frumpkin.

02:06:58.784 --> 02:07:00.775
"What makes you so special?"

02:07:00.775 --> 02:07:03.497
LIAM: Frumpkin vanishes and then
reappears on Dagen's shoulder.

02:07:03.497 --> 02:07:04.330
MATT: "Oh!"

02:07:05.164 --> 02:07:07.224
LIAM: And then begins to purr and do kitty biscuits

02:07:07.224 --> 02:07:08.335
on his shoulder.

02:07:08.335 --> 02:07:09.664
MATT: "Ahh!"

02:07:09.664 --> 02:07:11.434
LIAM: No, no, just let it happen.

02:07:11.434 --> 02:07:12.630
MATT: "Okay."

02:07:12.630 --> 02:07:14.229
(laughter)

02:07:14.229 --> 02:07:16.104
LIAM: It hurts at first, but then it starts to feel good.

02:07:16.104 --> 02:07:18.482
MATT: "Oh, inch to the left.

02:07:18.482 --> 02:07:19.694
"Ooh. Hoo hoo."

02:07:19.694 --> 02:07:22.284
TRAVIS: That doesn't make your nose go crazy?

02:07:22.284 --> 02:07:23.225
MATT: "Weirdly, no!"

02:07:24.304 --> 02:07:25.574
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, me neither.

02:07:25.574 --> 02:07:27.610
SAM: Maybe it's psychosomatic or something.

02:07:27.610 --> 02:07:29.372
TRAVIS: ♪ Addict, insane ♪

02:07:29.372 --> 02:07:31.259
(laughter)

02:07:31.259 --> 02:07:35.682
LAURA: Can you have your cats bring a little mini pie

02:07:35.682 --> 02:07:37.424
that's full of weasel food?

02:07:37.424 --> 02:07:38.634
LIAM: Weasel food specifically?

02:07:38.634 --> 02:07:39.994
LAURA: A weasel food pie?

02:07:39.994 --> 02:07:41.815
SAM: That's a great idea.
ASHLEY: What do weasels eat?

02:07:41.815 --> 02:07:43.807
TALIESIN: Other than weasel food.
LAURA: Nuts?

02:07:45.185 --> 02:07:46.647
SAM: <i>Do</i> they?

02:07:46.647 --> 02:07:51.059
(laughter)

02:07:51.059 --> 02:07:52.991
TALIESIN: What have you been feeding this weasel?!

02:07:52.991 --> 02:07:56.736
TRAVIS: They got sharp fucking teeth! Holy shit!

02:07:56.736 --> 02:07:58.427
LAURA: And bugs! And bugs and bugs.

02:07:58.427 --> 02:07:59.850
TALIESIN: Sprinkle's been throwing up.

02:07:59.850 --> 02:08:01.938
TRAVIS: Shitting literal bricks.

02:08:01.938 --> 02:08:04.064
MARISHA: He's eight pounds.

02:08:04.064 --> 02:08:05.704
TRAVIS: He's like a bag of marbles.

02:08:05.704 --> 02:08:07.354
He's like, "Ugh!"

02:08:08.193 --> 02:08:09.307
LIAM: I pick up a--

02:08:09.307 --> 02:08:11.891
(laughter)

02:08:11.891 --> 02:08:15.681
LIAM: I pick up little brass bell on the table and ring it

02:08:15.681 --> 02:08:20.681
and a small spectral cat comes into the room

02:08:20.784 --> 02:08:23.267
and (tiny step noises) up to the table.

02:08:23.267 --> 02:08:27.759
Costia, would you please go and get me the smallest pie,

02:08:27.759 --> 02:08:28.936
put nuts in it.

02:08:28.936 --> 02:08:30.402
What else?
LAURA: Bugs. Don't put nuts.

02:08:30.402 --> 02:08:32.252
I don't think nuts are--

02:08:32.252 --> 02:08:33.085
Maybe just some bugs?

02:08:33.085 --> 02:08:34.201
LIAM: So just bugs.

02:08:34.201 --> 02:08:35.034
LAURA: Bug pie.

02:08:35.034 --> 02:08:37.390
LIAM: Cooked-- cooked bugs?

02:08:37.390 --> 02:08:39.304
TRAVIS: Yasha might--
LAURA: Yasha, what's the best?

02:08:39.304 --> 02:08:41.094
Cooked bugs or raw bugs that are--

02:08:41.094 --> 02:08:43.544
ASHLEY: Well, you know, I would imagine

02:08:43.544 --> 02:08:45.314
they probably want them raw.

02:08:45.314 --> 02:08:46.472
LAURA: Raw bugs.
ASHLEY: You know, they don't

02:08:46.472 --> 02:08:48.788
cook their bugs in the wild, but

02:08:48.788 --> 02:08:52.994
I also have a feeling that-- maybe they do.

02:08:52.994 --> 02:08:55.790
I don't know weasel life very well.

02:08:55.790 --> 02:08:59.643
Maybe, um, maybe also get some, some--

02:08:59.643 --> 02:09:00.834
yeah, bugs would be good.

02:09:00.834 --> 02:09:02.625
LIAM: All right.
SAM: What were you going to suggest?

02:09:02.625 --> 02:09:03.592
LIAM: Hold on. Hold on.

02:09:03.592 --> 02:09:04.425
Costia--
ASHLEY: I feel like they eat

02:09:04.425 --> 02:09:06.651
other, smaller rodents.

02:09:06.651 --> 02:09:08.061
LAURA: Oh!
TRAVIS: Yeah, like mice or--

02:09:08.061 --> 02:09:10.349
LAURA: Oh, maybe like some mice in the pie?

02:09:10.349 --> 02:09:12.496
ASHLEY: You could do a little mice pie, you know?

02:09:12.496 --> 02:09:13.329
LIAM: Let's try this.

02:09:13.329 --> 02:09:16.568
Costia, get two small pies, okay?

02:09:16.568 --> 02:09:20.294
And if you need to ask Vanya to help carry the other one,

02:09:20.294 --> 02:09:22.744
get Vanya and the both of you bring in two pies.

02:09:22.744 --> 02:09:26.304
One of them just fill in a cooked pie crust with bugs,

02:09:26.304 --> 02:09:30.072
and then the other one, just do like-- mince some rabbit.

02:09:30.072 --> 02:09:31.530
LAURA: Ooh!
MATT: (affirmative cat noises)

02:09:31.530 --> 02:09:32.669
TRAVIS: Yeah.
LIAM: Yeah.

02:09:33.994 --> 02:09:37.214
MATT: Heads off to get your rabbit and bug pies.

02:09:37.214 --> 02:09:38.704
MARISHA: Does the cat look at me and go--

02:09:38.704 --> 02:09:40.434
as it goes out, like you just did?

02:09:40.434 --> 02:09:42.018
MATT: Yeah.
MARISHA: Awesome.

02:09:42.018 --> 02:09:44.367
(laughter)
MARISHA: That's my cat!

02:09:44.367 --> 02:09:46.562
TRAVIS: The over it cat.
MARISHA: I claim that one, yeah!

02:09:46.562 --> 02:09:48.133
TRAVIS: That asshole's mine!

02:09:48.133 --> 02:09:49.406
(laughter)

02:09:49.406 --> 02:09:53.106
MARISHA: The can't be bothered cat.
ASHLEY: Can you actually make two of those?

02:09:53.982 --> 02:09:55.182
MATT: (affirmative meow)
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:09:56.344 --> 02:09:58.385
LIAM: Nina, go and help them.

02:09:58.385 --> 02:10:01.034
MATT: (a meow that sounds like "Okay")
(laughter)

02:10:01.034 --> 02:10:04.077
TRAVIS: My cat is in a full hazmat
suit, so it doesn't affect me.

02:10:04.077 --> 02:10:06.524
(laughter)

02:10:06.524 --> 02:10:09.324
LIAM: Just put Armor of Agathys around the cats, always.

02:10:11.174 --> 02:10:12.774
TRAVIS: Leave it there and walk away.

02:10:12.774 --> 02:10:15.914
ASHLEY: (meowing)

02:10:15.914 --> 02:10:17.817
MATT: They retrieve the pies.

02:10:19.204 --> 02:10:20.778
LAURA: Sprinkle!

02:10:20.778 --> 02:10:22.691
Treats for you!
MATT: (snarling)

02:10:22.691 --> 02:10:24.549
LIAM: Oh, this is-- we do a test.

02:10:24.549 --> 02:10:27.244
Which one does Sprinkle like?
LAURA: Sprinkle, which pie do you like?

02:10:27.244 --> 02:10:29.960
MATT: (sniffing, grunts)

02:10:29.960 --> 02:10:33.114
(chomps) and just digs into the bunny pie.

02:10:33.114 --> 02:10:34.784
LAURA: Oh, the bunny pie!

02:10:34.784 --> 02:10:37.158
TALIESIN: Just to be safe, detect undead.

02:10:37.158 --> 02:10:40.904
(laughter)

02:10:40.904 --> 02:10:43.721
TALIESIN: It's a fair question!
MATT: No, it totally is.

02:10:43.721 --> 02:10:44.934
You do not detect undead.

02:10:44.934 --> 02:10:45.767
TALIESIN: Weird.

02:10:45.767 --> 02:10:48.357
LIAM: When Sprinkle ignores the insect pie,

02:10:48.357 --> 02:10:50.742
I just slide it over towards Yasha at the table.

02:10:50.742 --> 02:10:52.731
ASHLEY: (gobbling)

02:10:52.731 --> 02:10:55.117
TALIESIN: I was absolutely within my rights there.

02:10:55.117 --> 02:10:56.738
ASHLEY: Would anyone like to try?

02:10:56.738 --> 02:11:00.371
I mean, I feel like a bug pie is just such a delicacy.

02:11:00.371 --> 02:11:01.546
TRAVIS: Mm. Mm-mm.

02:11:01.546 --> 02:11:03.285
ASHLEY: No?
MATT: I'll go in on it. Yeah, sure.

02:11:03.285 --> 02:11:04.235
ASHLEY: Would you like to try a little bit?

02:11:04.235 --> 02:11:05.814
MATT: "I'll take a piece."
SAM: Oh, great.

02:11:05.814 --> 02:11:07.035
ASHLEY: Have a little bite.

02:11:07.035 --> 02:11:07.910
MARISHA: Yeah, give me a bite.

02:11:07.910 --> 02:11:10.229
That bug that I had in your bedroom wasn't too bad, so.

02:11:10.229 --> 02:11:11.884
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's not too bad!

02:11:11.884 --> 02:11:13.577
I think people are scared of it, but it's--

02:11:13.577 --> 02:11:14.909
MATT: "It's got to nice crunch to it.

02:11:14.909 --> 02:11:16.404
"Just got in my teeth a little bit."

02:11:16.404 --> 02:11:17.264
TRAVIS: Oh boy.

02:11:17.264 --> 02:11:18.154
ASHLEY: It's a little sticky.

02:11:18.154 --> 02:11:20.328
MARISHA: Kind of like an almond-y taste.
MATT: "Yeah!"

02:11:20.328 --> 02:11:22.691
LIAM: I will stick to the apple.

02:11:22.691 --> 02:11:24.249
MARISHA: It's good.
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.

02:11:24.249 --> 02:11:26.680
MATT: "You're missing out, friend. Just saying."

02:11:26.680 --> 02:11:28.372
LIAM: Mm. Pumpkin.

02:11:28.372 --> 02:11:30.684
SAM: With sour cream, couple walnuts?

02:11:30.684 --> 02:11:31.929
TRAVIS: Sour cream?

02:11:31.929 --> 02:11:33.712
LAURA: Mm. Mm-hmm.
SAM: So good. Little tang.

02:11:33.712 --> 02:11:34.801
TRAVIS: Never had it.

02:11:34.801 --> 02:11:37.934
LIAM: Okay, now that we're all relatively stuffed,

02:11:37.934 --> 02:11:40.119
do we want to talk about our day?

02:11:42.144 --> 02:11:44.594
LAURA: I mean, what's there to talk about?

02:11:44.594 --> 02:11:45.427
TALIESIN: Well--

02:11:45.427 --> 02:11:48.044
TRAVIS: The plan, though I think
we're going to reach out, right?

02:11:48.044 --> 02:11:50.814
SAM: Yeah, so folks that we could reach out to are Essek,

02:11:50.814 --> 02:11:53.974
maybe he'll know someone who has information

02:11:53.974 --> 02:11:55.064
about these places.

02:11:55.064 --> 02:11:59.279
Or we talked about calling someone in the Assembly?

02:11:59.279 --> 02:12:01.424
Or Astrid?

02:12:01.424 --> 02:12:02.934
MARISHA: Yeah, the Assembly gets dicey,

02:12:02.934 --> 02:12:04.994
'cause we're going to have to like lie real good.

02:12:04.994 --> 02:12:07.102
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: Why wouldn't it be Vess that reaches out?

02:12:07.102 --> 02:12:10.244
LAURA: And I got the one spell left today.

02:12:10.244 --> 02:12:11.436
SAM: Oh, just the one.

02:12:11.436 --> 02:12:12.269
MARISHA: Okay.

02:12:12.269 --> 02:12:13.891
LAURA: You know, we've been doing a lot.
TALIESIN: I think Essek's a good call.

02:12:13.891 --> 02:12:17.024
TRAVIS: And just for like an overarching strategy,

02:12:17.024 --> 02:12:20.123
are we at some point going to take Vess' body

02:12:20.123 --> 02:12:22.121
back to the Cerberus Assembly and be like,

02:12:22.121 --> 02:12:23.494
"She died a long time ago,

02:12:23.494 --> 02:12:24.484
"here's proof,

02:12:24.484 --> 02:12:25.564
"just trying to clear the record"?

02:12:25.564 --> 02:12:28.108
Or are we going to drop her out the window

02:12:28.108 --> 02:12:30.424
and say she died out in the wilderness by herself?

02:12:30.424 --> 02:12:32.740
LIAM: Well, this is a possible positive

02:12:32.740 --> 02:12:36.311
of contacting Astrid.
LAURA: Hey, um, you guys?

02:12:36.311 --> 02:12:37.144
MATT: "Interesting point--"

02:12:37.144 --> 02:12:37.977
LAURA: Guess what?

02:12:37.977 --> 02:12:40.964
MATT: "I just was real curious is, so I assume Vess

02:12:40.964 --> 02:12:44.091
"isn't going to meet us there cause she's dead?"

02:12:44.091 --> 02:12:47.515
TRAVIS: (blows raspberries)

02:12:47.515 --> 02:12:50.434
LIAM: Yes, Dagen, you are within the circle of trust now.

02:12:50.434 --> 02:12:53.714
This is a very complicated situation.
TRAVIS: Oh boy.

02:12:53.714 --> 02:12:55.114
MATT: "Wait a second, wait a second."

02:12:55.114 --> 02:12:55.952
TRAVIS: Oh boy.

02:12:55.952 --> 02:12:57.234
MATT: "(chuckles)"

02:12:57.234 --> 02:12:59.274
TRAVIS: Who's got the Modify?
LAURA: Nope.

02:12:59.274 --> 02:13:00.751
(laughter)

02:13:00.751 --> 02:13:01.963
TRAVIS: Oh boy.

02:13:01.963 --> 02:13:03.686
(laughter)

02:13:03.686 --> 02:13:05.114
TRAVIS: Whoops!

02:13:05.114 --> 02:13:07.583
MARISHA: Shit.

02:13:07.583 --> 02:13:10.550
TALIESIN: We may have a bottle of ether in somebody's bag.

02:13:10.550 --> 02:13:12.752
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)
TALIESIN: Go to sleep.

02:13:12.752 --> 02:13:13.829
LAURA: So here's the thing, Dagen--

02:13:13.829 --> 02:13:15.404
TRAVIS: Those histamines fucked me up, man.

02:13:15.404 --> 02:13:17.720
LAURA: (stammering) Those--

02:13:17.720 --> 02:13:20.394
LIAM: Just keep eating pie and listen to Jester.

02:13:20.394 --> 02:13:23.144
LAURA: Those people that came out

02:13:23.144 --> 02:13:25.969
of the ruins before us--
MATT: "Yeah?"

02:13:25.969 --> 02:13:27.744
LAURA: -- that we were like, "Hey, hide from them,

02:13:27.744 --> 02:13:29.539
"'cause they're scary people"?

02:13:29.539 --> 02:13:30.803
MATT: "Yeah?"

02:13:30.803 --> 02:13:34.424
LAURA: They sort of snuck in to the town

02:13:34.424 --> 02:13:37.045
and they killed-- they killed her.

02:13:40.551 --> 02:13:42.151
So we--

02:13:43.054 --> 02:13:48.054
because we were hired to protect her, sort of,

02:13:48.174 --> 02:13:50.541
we were hired, so we decided,

02:13:50.541 --> 02:13:52.254
"Oh, you know what we should do

02:13:52.254 --> 02:13:55.691
"is we should go after them and make them pay."

02:13:57.434 --> 02:13:58.736
So that's what we're doing now.

02:13:58.736 --> 02:14:00.265
(voice wavering) We're following them.

02:14:00.265 --> 02:14:03.494
(laughter)

02:14:03.494 --> 02:14:05.524
MATT: He's just looking real intent at you,

02:14:05.524 --> 02:14:07.274
his mouth still half-encrusted

02:14:07.274 --> 02:14:10.304
with bug pie and other pies caught in is black beard

02:14:10.304 --> 02:14:13.333
as he goes, "Oh."

02:14:13.333 --> 02:14:15.345
LAURA: But you'll still be paid for all your time!

02:14:17.284 --> 02:14:19.064
MATT: "Yeah, I assume."

02:14:19.064 --> 02:14:20.481
LAURA: And--
MATT: "You just--

02:14:23.664 --> 02:14:27.544
"And you didn't wish to share this information with me?"

02:14:27.544 --> 02:14:29.360
SAM: We--
MATT: "Now I'm an accomplice

02:14:29.360 --> 02:14:31.423
"in the murder of a member of the Cerberus Assembly."

02:14:31.423 --> 02:14:33.523
ALL: No!
LAURA: You're not an accomplice!

02:14:33.523 --> 02:14:36.258
Because we're trying to clear--

02:14:36.258 --> 02:14:38.284
We're trying to-- to--

02:14:39.815 --> 02:14:40.873
TRAVIS: No, keep going, you've got it.

02:14:40.873 --> 02:14:43.694
LAURA: We're figuring out how they killed her,

02:14:43.694 --> 02:14:48.694
we're going to bring those criminals to-- to justice,

02:14:49.172 --> 02:14:53.264
and that is why, you know, we're sort of--

02:14:53.264 --> 02:14:56.164
we're sort of a detective agency at the same time.

02:14:56.164 --> 02:14:57.794
We solve mysteries.

02:14:57.794 --> 02:14:59.564
SAM: We do. We're very good.

02:14:59.564 --> 02:15:01.974
LIAM: It's definitely bad, and apologies,

02:15:01.974 --> 02:15:04.124
we were improvising in the moment

02:15:04.124 --> 02:15:07.045
because it is obviously a very bad situation.

02:15:07.045 --> 02:15:08.154
MATT: "Yeah."

02:15:08.154 --> 02:15:10.417
LIAM: What we are discussing now

02:15:10.417 --> 02:15:12.944
is how to minimize the fallout

02:15:12.944 --> 02:15:16.227
from that problem, so--

02:15:16.227 --> 02:15:17.094
MATT: "Well--"
LIAM: One of the reasons,

02:15:17.094 --> 02:15:19.809
I had considered contacting Astrid and Eadwulf

02:15:19.809 --> 02:15:23.474
was because we could try to cover our tracks,

02:15:23.474 --> 02:15:24.994
pretend it never happened.

02:15:24.994 --> 02:15:27.570
Not doing a very good job here. Or--

02:15:27.570 --> 02:15:28.503
TRAVIS: I just see Matt.

02:15:28.503 --> 02:15:29.631
My RP sucks.

02:15:29.631 --> 02:15:33.344
(laughter)

02:15:33.344 --> 02:15:34.344
TRAVIS: Right next to me.

02:15:34.344 --> 02:15:35.285
LIAM: No one in the Assembly

02:15:35.285 --> 02:15:38.994
is a very big fan of each other.

02:15:38.994 --> 02:15:42.966
We could just try to be straightforward with my...

02:15:44.116 --> 02:15:49.116
friends and let them know what has happened.

02:15:50.891 --> 02:15:53.744
MARISHA: Why would we tell Eadwulf and Astrid?

02:15:53.744 --> 02:15:56.499
Why wouldn't we immediately tell Ludinus

02:15:56.499 --> 02:15:59.684
or another high-ranking member of the Assembly?

02:15:59.684 --> 02:16:02.384
LIAM: To get some help here. We need muscle.

02:16:03.364 --> 02:16:07.257
MARISHA: I have a deep feeling
they're not good at keeping secrets.

02:16:08.864 --> 02:16:11.984
If they were to be departed by one of

02:16:11.984 --> 02:16:15.944
their higher-ranking officers
to come and help us, that would be one thing,

02:16:15.944 --> 02:16:18.094
but going to them first seems like misstep.

02:16:21.772 --> 02:16:23.872
LAURA: How, how, how are you feeling, Dagen?
LIAM: Well, they know that we're with--

02:16:23.872 --> 02:16:24.705
LAURA: About it all?

02:16:24.705 --> 02:16:26.857
MARISHA: Yeah, what was he--
but you were about to say something.

02:16:28.644 --> 02:16:31.351
MATT: "I don't know half of what you just said.

02:16:31.351 --> 02:16:32.250
"People and stuff.

02:16:32.250 --> 02:16:35.083
"All I do know

02:16:35.083 --> 02:16:37.956
"is you don't fuck with the Cerberus Assembly."

02:16:37.956 --> 02:16:40.680
MARISHA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Ooh, yeah.

02:16:40.680 --> 02:16:41.579
MATT: "Whew..."

02:16:41.579 --> 02:16:43.913
MARISHA: Yeah, no, we know, man, that's kind of why

02:16:43.913 --> 02:16:45.874
we didn't tell you, we didn't want to, like,

02:16:45.874 --> 02:16:46.834
put you in an awkward position.

02:16:46.834 --> 02:16:48.634
MATT: "Yeah, no, I kind of wish I didn't hear that."

02:16:48.634 --> 02:16:49.814
TALIESIN: I mean, if it's any consolation,

02:16:49.814 --> 02:16:52.014
I had completely forgotten that you didn't know.

02:16:52.884 --> 02:16:56.093
ASHLEY: And we also have been carrying her dead body with us

02:16:56.093 --> 02:16:58.322
to return at some point.

02:16:58.322 --> 02:17:00.142
MATT: "Well, that makes it right as rain!"

02:17:01.227 --> 02:17:02.722
ASHLEY: No, I realize that sounds worse.

02:17:02.722 --> 02:17:06.135
SAM: We also wanted to maybe dump it in the lava, maybe.

02:17:08.004 --> 02:17:08.837
ASHLEY: Dump it in--

02:17:08.837 --> 02:17:11.294
MATT: "That is probably your best bet."
SAM: Okay!

02:17:11.294 --> 02:17:13.774
MATT: "And just keep going north and never go back.

02:17:13.774 --> 02:17:15.384
"Just live up here.

02:17:15.384 --> 02:17:17.712
"I can show you ways.

02:17:17.712 --> 02:17:20.093
"This is not comfortable."
TRAVIS: Just live up here?

02:17:20.093 --> 02:17:22.770
(laughter)

02:17:22.770 --> 02:17:25.404
MATT: "Oh boy.

02:17:25.404 --> 02:17:27.573
"This is a right mess--"
TRAVIS: Don't sweat it!

02:17:27.573 --> 02:17:30.884
MATT: "-- you got yourself into, Dagen."
TRAVIS: I push some of the shepherd's pie over.

02:17:30.884 --> 02:17:33.227
It's going to be fine. Don't worry about it.

02:17:33.227 --> 02:17:35.704
LIAM: I think, though the longer we hide it,

02:17:35.704 --> 02:17:37.774
the worse it would be with us and the Assembly

02:17:37.774 --> 02:17:40.574
and perhaps letting them know that she was murdered,

02:17:40.574 --> 02:17:45.184
not by us, but by (sighs) our old friend--

02:17:46.523 --> 02:17:48.814
TALIESIN: I don't know if that's
the call for tonight, though.

02:17:48.814 --> 02:17:49.837
LIAM: No, not tonight.

02:17:50.994 --> 02:17:54.014
TALIESIN: But yeah, I agree. That's a--

02:17:54.014 --> 02:17:57.464
LIAM: I just know that it will
get worse the more time elapses.

02:17:57.464 --> 02:17:58.704
TRAVIS: I think I agree as well.

02:17:58.704 --> 02:18:00.784
If we just leave her here, the question is like,

02:18:00.784 --> 02:18:02.690
how did we survive and not her?

02:18:02.690 --> 02:18:03.839
I thought we were watching her.

02:18:03.839 --> 02:18:06.069
LAURA: Plus, you know, I have the ability

02:18:06.069 --> 02:18:08.364
to make people tell the truth.

02:18:08.364 --> 02:18:10.724
I'm sure a lot of other people in the Assembly

02:18:10.724 --> 02:18:12.514
have that ability as well.

02:18:12.514 --> 02:18:14.616
MATT: "Wish you had the ability to

02:18:14.616 --> 02:18:16.414
"fucking wipe my mind right now."

02:18:16.414 --> 02:18:18.044
TALIESIN: Working on it.

02:18:18.044 --> 02:18:19.044
LAURA: Do you want me to?

02:18:20.075 --> 02:18:20.908
MATT: "Can you?"

02:18:22.052 --> 02:18:22.885
TALIESIN: Uh.

02:18:24.458 --> 02:18:26.357
LAURA: I mean, I can.

02:18:26.357 --> 02:18:28.525
TALIESIN: You can?
MATT: "Then, if you wouldn't mind,

02:18:29.718 --> 02:18:31.444
"I don't want to know about this.

02:18:31.444 --> 02:18:33.324
"Culpable deniability.

02:18:33.324 --> 02:18:34.634
"Look, your business is your own,

02:18:34.634 --> 02:18:36.919
"but this puts me in a weird position.

02:18:36.919 --> 02:18:39.774
"Either that or I'm going to have to
ask for a lot more money."

02:18:39.774 --> 02:18:41.065
TRAVIS: I understand. We don't have--

02:18:41.065 --> 02:18:43.034
I mean, we have a lot to give, but--

02:18:43.034 --> 02:18:44.984
LIAM: Yeah, that's true because we actually--

02:18:47.794 --> 02:18:49.164
flies out of my pockets.

02:18:49.164 --> 02:18:50.794
TRAVIS: Yep.

02:18:50.794 --> 02:18:53.644
LIAM: So, ignorance is bliss.

02:18:53.644 --> 02:18:55.424
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm all for it.

02:18:55.424 --> 02:18:57.534
LAURA: Okay. Tell you what.

02:18:57.534 --> 02:19:00.814
I will definitely do that for you.

02:19:00.814 --> 02:19:02.234
Here's the thing, though.

02:19:02.234 --> 02:19:04.184
Do we want to do that tonight?

02:19:04.184 --> 02:19:06.264
Or do we want to talk to Essek?

02:19:06.264 --> 02:19:09.274
Because, regardless, I can make it disappear

02:19:09.274 --> 02:19:14.274
tomorrow for you or the next day, and you still won't know.

02:19:14.876 --> 02:19:16.442
TALIESIN: That way you won't have to keep remembering

02:19:16.442 --> 02:19:18.861
every time that we forget that you don't know.

02:19:18.861 --> 02:19:19.694
And we will.

02:19:19.694 --> 02:19:21.884
LIAM: Just one bad night of sleep.

02:19:21.884 --> 02:19:22.717
Or two.

02:19:24.015 --> 02:19:25.348
MATT: "(unhappy sigh)"

02:19:25.348 --> 02:19:26.794
SAM: First thing in the morning?

02:19:27.894 --> 02:19:29.679
Wake up, have a coffee, and wipe your memory, maybe?

02:19:29.679 --> 02:19:32.613
LAURA: How does that work?
Because if, like, the memory sticks,

02:19:32.613 --> 02:19:35.761
and he remembers that he remembered it the next day--

02:19:38.016 --> 02:19:39.049
TRAVIS: Uh-oh.

02:19:40.618 --> 02:19:42.067
LAURA: How does that work?
SAM: We'll find out!

02:19:42.067 --> 02:19:44.584
LIAM: You've done it before, though, have you not?

02:19:44.584 --> 02:19:46.144
LAURA: Well, yeah, but that was instantaneous,

02:19:46.144 --> 02:19:47.467
you know what I mean?

02:19:47.467 --> 02:19:48.904
But, I mean, I have the ability to do it

02:19:48.904 --> 02:19:51.004
from days before, so obviously...

02:19:52.224 --> 02:19:53.332
SAM: It'll work.
TALIESIN: I think you can just

02:19:53.332 --> 02:19:54.573
cover it with something, maybe.

02:19:54.573 --> 02:19:57.451
Just be like, "Oh, you've been feeling sick."

02:19:57.451 --> 02:19:59.122
LAURA: It's like a chain reaction.
TALIESIN: For a day.

02:19:59.122 --> 02:20:00.304
Yeah. Oh god.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

02:20:00.304 --> 02:20:01.914
TALIESIN: You've got a stomach thing.

02:20:01.914 --> 02:20:05.846
MATT: "Well, regardless, this is a fine mess you're in."

02:20:05.846 --> 02:20:07.316
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: "Um.

02:20:10.524 --> 02:20:13.884
"Let's just keep traveling north and hope for the best.

02:20:13.884 --> 02:20:15.994
"Maybe it'll take a while for them to figure it out.

02:20:15.994 --> 02:20:16.840
"I don't know."

02:20:16.840 --> 02:20:18.494
LIAM: We'll figure it out as we go, Dagen,

02:20:18.494 --> 02:20:19.327
that's what we do.

02:20:19.327 --> 02:20:20.693
MARISHA: Yeah, don't worry about it.
LIAM: We're the Mighty Nein.

02:20:20.693 --> 02:20:22.651
MATT: "Okay."
MARISHA: It's not your problem to worry about.

02:20:22.651 --> 02:20:23.492
MATT: "Okay."

02:20:23.492 --> 02:20:25.312
LAURA: We'll keep you safe, Dagen.

02:20:27.752 --> 02:20:32.683
MATT: "All right. (chewing)

02:20:32.683 --> 02:20:34.024
"(with a mouthful of food) I'm going to go to bed."

02:20:34.024 --> 02:20:36.065
SAM: Okay. Good night.
TALIESIN: Fair.

02:20:36.065 --> 02:20:37.733
MATT: "Up! Wee!"

02:20:37.733 --> 02:20:40.291
(laughter)

02:20:43.094 --> 02:20:44.984
Goes and makes his way to bed.

02:20:44.984 --> 02:20:47.035
TRAVIS: I totally forgot he was here.

02:20:47.035 --> 02:20:49.537
I'm so sorry.
TALIESIN: I forgot he didn't know.

02:20:49.537 --> 02:20:51.374
TRAVIS: I just, he was so familiar.

02:20:51.374 --> 02:20:53.157
I thought we were cool.

02:20:55.484 --> 02:20:59.964
MARISHA: So Caduceus, when can you
talk to Vess DeRogna again?

02:20:59.964 --> 02:21:01.304
TALIESIN: Two more days.

02:21:01.304 --> 02:21:02.137
Two more days.

02:21:03.234 --> 02:21:05.184
SAM: And is there anyone in the world that we know

02:21:05.184 --> 02:21:09.614
who might have any information about these locations?

02:21:09.614 --> 02:21:11.448
A2, Aeor.

02:21:11.448 --> 02:21:13.135
TRAVIS: Well, Essek.

02:21:13.135 --> 02:21:13.968
SAM: Want to try Essek?

02:21:13.968 --> 02:21:14.964
TRAVIS: We could try.

02:21:14.964 --> 02:21:16.981
It doesn't alert the Cerberus Assembly in the same way

02:21:16.981 --> 02:21:17.847
as Astrid does.

02:21:17.847 --> 02:21:20.249
TALIESIN: The other thing is have we have we talked to Essek

02:21:20.249 --> 02:21:23.257
about Nonagon or any of that yet?

02:21:23.257 --> 02:21:25.097
TRAVIS: I can't remember. I don't think--

02:21:25.097 --> 02:21:26.904
TALIESIN: I don't think we have.

02:21:26.904 --> 02:21:29.754
LAURA: It's a lot of conversation for 25 words.

02:21:29.754 --> 02:21:33.704
TRAVIS: Let's just hit up the Bright Queen! Take a big shot.

02:21:34.864 --> 02:21:36.338
TALIESIN: I think we should let him know--
TRAVIS: Nope!

02:21:36.338 --> 02:21:40.204
TALIESIN: -- that we're in a lot and that maybe we need to

02:21:40.204 --> 02:21:42.444
figure out a way to have a longer conversation

02:21:42.444 --> 02:21:44.774
and we can't do it on this end.

02:21:44.774 --> 02:21:46.322
LAURA: Okay.

02:21:46.322 --> 02:21:48.887
I don't know how we'll get there. We can't teleport here.

02:21:48.887 --> 02:21:52.099
TALIESIN: No, but maybe we can talk somehow.

02:21:53.162 --> 02:21:54.087
LAURA: Okay.

02:21:56.014 --> 02:21:57.567
TALIESIN: Quick, quick question before we--

02:22:00.254 --> 02:22:01.204
What are the goals?

02:22:01.204 --> 02:22:02.984
I know that the plans are amorphous,

02:22:02.984 --> 02:22:07.984
but, like, what are we-- what's the good outcome here?

02:22:08.684 --> 02:22:10.351
SAM: Well, I mean, I assume we all think that

02:22:10.351 --> 02:22:15.351
whatever the Lucien's doing is probably bad, right?

02:22:15.754 --> 02:22:18.634
So I think that the goal is to stop it?

02:22:18.634 --> 02:22:20.884
TALIESIN: So that's <i>a</i> goal, but it doesn't seem like--

02:22:24.434 --> 02:22:25.664
I feel like that's <i>a</i> goal,

02:22:25.664 --> 02:22:27.884
I don't know if that's <i>the</i> goal.

02:22:27.884 --> 02:22:32.164
I feel like everybody's a little all over the place.

02:22:32.164 --> 02:22:32.997
I don't know.

02:22:34.400 --> 02:22:35.351
You're all--

02:22:35.351 --> 02:22:36.854
LIAM: We're a bit thrown.

02:22:36.854 --> 02:22:38.381
TALIESIN: You're all thrown.

02:22:38.381 --> 02:22:40.034
TRAVIS: It was kind of outside the rule book

02:22:40.034 --> 02:22:43.994
when someone lives, dies, lives again, dies,

02:22:43.994 --> 02:22:47.792
and then lives a third time from the first version

02:22:47.792 --> 02:22:50.058
SAM: Although, we have seen some of that

02:22:50.058 --> 02:22:51.425
in our travels, right?

02:22:51.425 --> 02:22:55.784
In Xhorhas, we learned about them having souls

02:22:55.784 --> 02:22:58.114
that can jump into each other's bodies

02:22:58.114 --> 02:22:59.856
when they die and stuff?

02:22:59.856 --> 02:23:01.054
It's not the same thing.

02:23:01.054 --> 02:23:03.957
LAURA: Connected to the Luxon in some way.

02:23:04.994 --> 02:23:07.135
TALIESIN: That's kind of my question is--

02:23:07.135 --> 02:23:11.054
From the second that you found out
that your friend was back,

02:23:11.054 --> 02:23:15.324
was the goal to stop him from doing something evil?

02:23:15.324 --> 02:23:17.297
Was that the plan from day one?

02:23:18.742 --> 02:23:19.985
TRAVIS: Ye--

02:23:19.985 --> 02:23:20.818
LAURA: No.

02:23:20.818 --> 02:23:23.024
MARISHA: Well, I think the original plan was

02:23:23.024 --> 02:23:24.684
that there's still this brewing tension

02:23:24.684 --> 02:23:26.244
between the Empire and the Dynasty

02:23:26.244 --> 02:23:29.304
and both sides seem to believe that there is

02:23:29.304 --> 02:23:32.604
divinity eliminating magic.

02:23:32.604 --> 02:23:34.954
TALIESIN: I'm just talking about your friend.

02:23:34.954 --> 02:23:37.524
Like, we went somewhere to see

02:23:37.524 --> 02:23:41.914
if he was still in the ground and he wasn't,

02:23:41.914 --> 02:23:44.704
and then this happened.

02:23:44.704 --> 02:23:48.744
LIAM: I think his thread is coming up alongside us here,

02:23:48.744 --> 02:23:51.494
because the reason we came

02:23:51.494 --> 02:23:55.384
was to spend time with this dead woman

02:23:55.384 --> 02:23:57.574
and learn a little bit about what she was doing

02:23:57.574 --> 02:23:59.872
and what the Empire is doing.

02:23:59.872 --> 02:24:02.999
What the Empire is doing is
at odds with the Dynasty, yet again.

02:24:02.999 --> 02:24:05.804
Even though that we've achieved peace,

02:24:05.804 --> 02:24:07.614
both sides are in some sort of arms race

02:24:07.614 --> 02:24:10.555
for whatever is buried up here.

02:24:10.555 --> 02:24:12.064
And we don't want the war to continue.

02:24:12.064 --> 02:24:14.965
We are trying to keep a lasting peace.

02:24:15.964 --> 02:24:16.937
Now she's dead.

02:24:16.937 --> 02:24:20.754
We're not going to learn too much from her.

02:24:20.754 --> 02:24:22.114
We might in a couple of days.

02:24:22.114 --> 02:24:24.574
TALIESIN: I was under the assumption
when we first started heading

02:24:24.574 --> 02:24:27.100
this direction, well, when we found out

02:24:27.100 --> 02:24:30.725
that we weren't alone heading in this direction,

02:24:30.725 --> 02:24:34.404
that the goal was that you wanted your friend back.

02:24:36.634 --> 02:24:39.104
And I don't know if that goal has actually changed,

02:24:39.104 --> 02:24:42.552
I just don't know if anybody's talking about it.

02:24:42.552 --> 02:24:44.082
And I'm a little worried.

02:24:44.082 --> 02:24:48.057
LAURA: I feel like that goal is disappearing.

02:24:49.252 --> 02:24:50.604
MARISHA: I never had any illusions

02:24:50.604 --> 02:24:52.424
that we were going to get him back.

02:24:52.424 --> 02:24:54.684
TRAVIS: I don't know if that's what I want, either.

02:24:54.684 --> 02:24:59.684
It almost feels like a betrayal of something that passed.

02:25:00.224 --> 02:25:03.481
TALIESIN: Maybe, but I'm just pointing out

02:25:03.481 --> 02:25:05.481
that if you wanted to know how to do it,

02:25:06.374 --> 02:25:08.624
in two days, we could ask the person who did.

02:25:09.674 --> 02:25:10.665
LAURA: That's true.

02:25:11.567 --> 02:25:13.655
ASHLEY: I would love to have my friend back.

02:25:13.655 --> 02:25:16.783
TALIESIN: I don't know if it would work, but I feel like

02:25:16.783 --> 02:25:21.783
everyone's been running in different directions.

02:25:21.984 --> 02:25:25.527
LAURA: Honestly, when we were going into that ruin,

02:25:25.527 --> 02:25:28.707
I didn't know why we were walking in.

02:25:28.707 --> 02:25:29.870
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:25:29.870 --> 02:25:33.761
LAURA: I mean, we were hired to help Vess.

02:25:33.761 --> 02:25:34.784
She's dead.

02:25:34.784 --> 02:25:36.194
It's done.

02:25:36.194 --> 02:25:38.166
We could have just walked away.

02:25:38.166 --> 02:25:43.164
LIAM: Well, I am worried that
whatever she was picking at here,

02:25:43.164 --> 02:25:46.424
and whatever Lucien is picking at here,

02:25:46.424 --> 02:25:49.024
and supposedly the Dynasty is as well,

02:25:49.024 --> 02:25:52.304
he's going to rip apart the tenuous peace

02:25:52.304 --> 02:25:53.454
that has been achieved.

02:25:55.534 --> 02:25:57.879
Whatever it is is not good.

02:25:59.864 --> 02:26:02.017
And we could contact either side.

02:26:03.084 --> 02:26:07.600
Obviously, I have ties on one, but

02:26:07.600 --> 02:26:11.141
I don't think either side wants whatever Lucien is chasing.

02:26:13.204 --> 02:26:15.884
And we're just trying to figure out what it is.

02:26:15.884 --> 02:26:18.468
We have theories. We've had visions, even.

02:26:19.494 --> 02:26:22.044
MARISHA: That's my thing is I feel like we're all forgetting

02:26:22.044 --> 02:26:25.127
about this huge piece

02:26:25.127 --> 02:26:28.424
is that we all had this shared vision

02:26:28.424 --> 02:26:31.608
of a flying city in another dimension.

02:26:31.608 --> 02:26:32.441
I'm...

02:26:34.108 --> 02:26:38.999
not one for a believer in a shared vision

02:26:38.999 --> 02:26:40.424
is that common.

02:26:40.424 --> 02:26:43.954
TALIESIN: I'm not common, but it's interesting

02:26:43.954 --> 02:26:47.507
that just things have been all over the place.

02:26:49.767 --> 02:26:51.500
I don't know.
MARISHA: In what way?

02:26:52.372 --> 02:26:55.324
Because I feel like everything is converging.

02:26:55.324 --> 02:26:57.194
It's been all over the place, and now it feels like

02:26:57.194 --> 02:26:58.554
it's all coming to a head.

02:26:58.554 --> 02:27:00.034
TALIESIN: I'm not talking about outside.

02:27:00.034 --> 02:27:02.604
I'm just talking about everybody in here.

02:27:02.604 --> 02:27:04.734
LIAM: Oh, one hundred percent agreed.

02:27:04.734 --> 02:27:07.894
We do not have a cohesive plan.

02:27:07.894 --> 02:27:09.254
At all.

02:27:09.254 --> 02:27:10.087
Not at all.

02:27:10.087 --> 02:27:11.884
We have, not for days, not since she died.

02:27:11.884 --> 02:27:13.814
We knew what we were doing when she was alive.

02:27:13.814 --> 02:27:16.474
As soon as she was snuffed out, so was our purpose.

02:27:16.474 --> 02:27:18.034
I don't know what we're doing,

02:27:18.034 --> 02:27:20.157
but I know what I am afraid of.

02:27:21.664 --> 02:27:24.144
And I know that we're being pulled towards this thing

02:27:24.144 --> 02:27:27.417
and I have both very real world concerns,

02:27:28.284 --> 02:27:32.814
and then we have fate.

02:27:33.892 --> 02:27:35.164
TALIESIN: It's very weird.

02:27:35.164 --> 02:27:36.819
MARISHA: Destiny?

02:27:36.819 --> 02:27:37.652
What is it?

02:27:37.652 --> 02:27:38.485
TALIESIN: Fate.

02:27:40.064 --> 02:27:42.904
I like fate, but--

02:27:42.904 --> 02:27:44.347
MARISHA: Call it whatever you want.

02:27:45.634 --> 02:27:48.592
TALIESIN: So the Dynasty is a pit we haven't dug into yet.

02:27:50.594 --> 02:27:51.827
Who knows what's there.

02:27:53.557 --> 02:27:55.634
LAURA: I'm going to pull out my tarot cards.

02:27:55.634 --> 02:27:56.567
SAM: Ooh!

02:27:57.691 --> 02:28:00.284
TALIESIN: Bold.
MARISHA: (whispers) Give us a sign.

02:28:00.284 --> 02:28:01.134
LAURA: Okay.

02:28:01.134 --> 02:28:02.304
TALIESIN: See if I can guess which one.

02:28:02.304 --> 02:28:04.130
SAM: Who are you going to read? Yourself?

02:28:04.130 --> 02:28:05.280
LAURA: I'm just going to pull out a card

02:28:05.280 --> 02:28:06.374
and look to our future.

02:28:06.374 --> 02:28:07.207
SAM: Okay, cool.

02:28:07.207 --> 02:28:08.930
LAURA: Give us a sign.

02:28:14.334 --> 02:28:17.094
Oh, interesting.

02:28:17.094 --> 02:28:21.534
I pull out the card that says The Magician, The Tinker.

02:28:21.534 --> 02:28:23.487
I pull out the card that says The Magician, The Tinker.

02:28:23.487 --> 02:28:26.350
SAM: The Magician and Tinker?
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

02:28:26.350 --> 02:28:29.437
TALIESIN: Which one was facing up?

02:28:29.437 --> 02:28:30.402
LAURA: Oh! Well.

02:28:30.402 --> 02:28:31.845
TALIESIN: The number should tell you.

02:28:34.164 --> 02:28:35.655
Oh, no.
LAURA: No, I got to roll.

02:28:35.655 --> 02:28:37.517
TALIESIN: Got to roll, sorry.

02:28:37.517 --> 02:28:38.734
Forgot the system.

02:28:41.822 --> 02:28:43.397
LAURA: The Magician.

02:28:44.624 --> 02:28:49.155
So Molly drew this card for you, Caleb.

02:28:50.194 --> 02:28:51.665
It looks like you.

02:28:53.544 --> 02:28:58.034
You're sitting in the room and all around you

02:28:58.034 --> 02:29:00.460
are strange orbiting lights.

02:29:03.790 --> 02:29:06.004
Veth is on the other side of the card, though.

02:29:06.004 --> 02:29:07.987
Well, Nott is.

02:29:09.034 --> 02:29:11.269
Isn't that interesting?
SAM: It is weird!

02:29:11.269 --> 02:29:12.967
LAURA: Molly drew cards for all of us.

02:29:16.425 --> 02:29:18.000
ASHLEY: He did?

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:21.192
LAURA: Maybe that just means that we follow the magic.

02:29:25.144 --> 02:29:26.894
What does your gut tell you, Caleb?

02:29:30.414 --> 02:29:32.634
LIAM: I've been trying to make sense

02:29:32.634 --> 02:29:35.314
of everything that's happened in the last few weeks

02:29:35.314 --> 02:29:38.782
every day and I am not seeing it.

02:29:42.794 --> 02:29:47.567
But I know that we're supposed to go where Molly is.

02:29:48.884 --> 02:29:51.657
Otherwise we would not have seen the things that we've seen.

02:29:55.104 --> 02:29:57.079
We wouldn't be the Mighty Nein.

02:30:03.970 --> 02:30:08.970
So the real world exists behind us waiting for us to return.

02:30:09.734 --> 02:30:11.694
LAURA: Let's just start our own nation up here.

02:30:11.694 --> 02:30:13.364
Maybe Dagen is right.

02:30:13.364 --> 02:30:14.394
TRAVIS: Our own nation?

02:30:14.394 --> 02:30:16.634
LAURA: Yeah. We'll just start over.

02:30:16.634 --> 02:30:20.101
MARISHA: We already have a resort town
with a bar named after me in Rumblecusp.

02:30:20.101 --> 02:30:21.609
LAURA: Exactly.
MARISHA: Let's go--

02:30:21.609 --> 02:30:22.792
LAURA: We don't have to go anywhere, we--

02:30:22.792 --> 02:30:23.834
TRAVIS: Franchises!

02:30:23.834 --> 02:30:24.667
MARISHA: Ah.

02:30:25.774 --> 02:30:27.244
LAURA: We need to open the bar here.

02:30:27.244 --> 02:30:28.411
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:30:28.411 --> 02:30:30.044
TRAVIS: Summer, winter.

02:30:30.044 --> 02:30:30.877
TALIESIN: An ice bar.

02:30:33.884 --> 02:30:35.254
MARISHA: An ice bar? Yeah.

02:30:35.254 --> 02:30:39.452
LAURA: Honestly, this may sound stupid, but

02:30:41.636 --> 02:30:46.636
wherever you guys want to go, I'll be there.

02:30:47.834 --> 02:30:49.775
SAM: That does sound stupid, Jester.

02:30:49.775 --> 02:30:51.221
(laughter)

02:30:51.221 --> 02:30:54.594
LAURA: I just don't have a strong pull anywhere, you know?

02:30:54.594 --> 02:30:56.144
I just want to do what do you guys want to do.

02:30:56.144 --> 02:30:57.824
I want to do with you.
SAM: I'm joking.

02:30:57.824 --> 02:31:01.074
It's the rhubarb that's making me silly.

02:31:01.074 --> 02:31:03.604
I feel the exact same way.

02:31:03.604 --> 02:31:04.684
As long as we're together,

02:31:04.684 --> 02:31:07.284
I feel like we're going to be doing the right thing.

02:31:09.926 --> 02:31:12.794
And that means being with Molly, too.

02:31:12.794 --> 02:31:14.254
Even if he's not Molly anymore.

02:31:14.254 --> 02:31:18.604
It means staying with him and seeing

02:31:18.604 --> 02:31:20.697
if there's some part of him still inside.

02:31:25.001 --> 02:31:29.176
LIAM: You all feel in your gut
that what he's doing here is not good.

02:31:30.644 --> 02:31:31.810
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.
LAURA: Yeah.

02:31:32.919 --> 02:31:35.092
ASHLEY: (uncertain noise)

02:31:35.092 --> 02:31:35.925
Yes.

02:31:35.925 --> 02:31:38.526
(laughter)

02:31:40.234 --> 02:31:42.954
LAURA: It's dangerous and powerful.

02:31:42.954 --> 02:31:45.704
And it's going to fuck up the world if he completes it.

02:31:50.564 --> 02:31:51.914
SAM: Well.

02:31:53.314 --> 02:31:55.371
LIAM: Well, somebody who has to

02:31:55.371 --> 02:31:57.463
help the Empire and the Dynasty.

02:31:59.877 --> 02:32:02.712
Might as well well be this group of schmucks.

02:32:05.295 --> 02:32:07.224
TRAVIS: Essek?

02:32:07.224 --> 02:32:11.680
LAURA: Oh, right. I will send a message to Essek.

02:32:11.680 --> 02:32:13.085
SAM: Well--

02:32:13.085 --> 02:32:13.918
MARISHA: What are we going to say?

02:32:13.918 --> 02:32:16.514
SAM: We only have one thing that we can say to him, right?

02:32:16.514 --> 02:32:17.347
TALIESIN: One word.

02:32:18.344 --> 02:32:19.794
LAURA: Nonagon, right?

02:32:19.794 --> 02:32:22.834
SAM: But, like, what is the one piece of information

02:32:22.834 --> 02:32:25.684
he could give us in 25 words that would help us the most?

02:32:29.874 --> 02:32:31.024
LAURA: Honestly, I don't know.

02:32:31.024 --> 02:32:33.944
It's not like he can send a coordinate.

02:32:33.944 --> 02:32:35.119
I guess he could.

02:32:37.264 --> 02:32:40.844
TRAVIS: Is he aware of any heavy Dynasty activity

02:32:40.844 --> 02:32:43.850
in Foren or Aeor?

02:32:43.850 --> 02:32:45.184
TALIESIN: He might've known about that group

02:32:45.184 --> 02:32:46.914
that just got slaughtered.

02:32:46.914 --> 02:32:50.454
MARISHA: Maybe you just say, "We're headed to Aeor."

02:32:50.454 --> 02:32:51.761
SAM: What do we need to know?

02:32:51.761 --> 02:32:53.261
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:32:53.261 --> 02:32:54.874
MARISHA: We need help.

02:32:54.874 --> 02:32:56.974
LAURA: Okay.
TALIESIN: The Nonagon is here.

02:32:56.974 --> 02:32:58.194
MARISHA: The Nonagon is here.

02:32:58.194 --> 02:33:00.414
We're looking for threshold crests.

02:33:00.414 --> 02:33:01.752
LAURA: Okay.

02:33:01.752 --> 02:33:05.727
Ugh, okay, that's a lot a lot. Okay.

02:33:05.727 --> 02:33:06.785
SAM: And you poopin'.

02:33:13.548 --> 02:33:14.564
LAURA: Hi!

02:33:18.334 --> 02:33:19.927
We're heading to Aeor.

02:33:23.244 --> 02:33:24.837
The Nonagon is here.

02:33:26.714 --> 02:33:28.037
Can you help us?

02:33:29.794 --> 02:33:33.807
We're looking for threshold crests.

02:33:39.024 --> 02:33:43.337
Do you have any knowledge?

02:33:46.114 --> 02:33:47.350
Huh?

02:33:47.350 --> 02:33:49.737
(laughter)

02:33:49.737 --> 02:33:51.535
That's the worst message I've ever sent!

02:33:51.535 --> 02:33:53.205
MARISHA: I think it was pretty fucking great.
ASHLEY: No, it's not.

02:33:53.205 --> 02:33:54.613
SAM: It was four ideas in there!

02:33:54.613 --> 02:33:56.004
ASHLEY: You got a lot in there.

02:33:56.004 --> 02:33:58.084
LIAM: It was concise.
ASHLEY: You got a lot in there.

02:33:58.084 --> 02:33:58.917
LAURA: Okay.

02:34:00.571 --> 02:34:04.094
MATT: Not but a moment later you get a response from Essek.

02:34:04.094 --> 02:34:07.241
"Jester, it has been a bit.

02:34:09.225 --> 02:34:10.467
"That was a lot.

02:34:13.234 --> 02:34:16.437
"But Aeor, interesting.

02:34:20.044 --> 02:34:23.834
"I'm at a Vermus outpost to its east."

02:34:23.834 --> 02:34:24.667
SAM: Wait, what?

02:34:24.667 --> 02:34:26.880
MARISHA: Oh my god!
(gasping)

02:34:26.880 --> 02:34:28.354
MARISHA: He's at the what outpost?

02:34:28.354 --> 02:34:29.933
TRAVIS: Vermust outpost?
LAURA: Avermous, avermus?

02:34:29.933 --> 02:34:32.114
TRAVIS: He's not done, he's not done!

02:34:32.114 --> 02:34:33.744
MATT: That's all you had at the moment.

02:34:33.744 --> 02:34:34.744
ASHLEY: Oh.

02:34:34.744 --> 02:34:35.997
LIAM: Ah-ver-mist?

02:34:35.997 --> 02:34:37.154
MATT: No, Vermus.

02:34:37.154 --> 02:34:39.806
TRAVIS: A4 is to the east.
LAURA: Dagen! Dagen!

02:34:39.806 --> 02:34:41.304
Do you know where a Vermus outpost is?

02:34:41.304 --> 02:34:43.077
SAM: He's asleep! We got to go wake him up!

02:34:43.077 --> 02:34:43.910
LAURA: Oh, shit!

02:34:43.910 --> 02:34:45.401
TALIESIN: We can find out in the morning.

02:34:45.401 --> 02:34:46.350
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

02:34:46.350 --> 02:34:48.075
MARISHA: How far away is it from-- wait, wait, wait, wait.

02:34:48.075 --> 02:34:51.401
Where's your map?
TRAVIS: You sneaky bastard!

02:34:51.401 --> 02:34:52.925
MARISHA: I knew it! It was only a matter of time

02:34:52.925 --> 02:34:55.434
before we ran into people we know!

02:34:55.434 --> 02:34:57.928
It's like going to the mall on a Sunday.

02:34:57.928 --> 02:34:58.799
(laughter)

02:34:58.799 --> 02:35:00.721
You're going to run into your aunt.

02:35:00.721 --> 02:35:02.571
TRAVIS: Your aunt?
LAURA: Why are all my spells gone?

02:35:02.571 --> 02:35:04.000
I can't send any more messages.

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:05.640
TRAVIS: What's it like in Kentucky malls?

02:35:05.640 --> 02:35:07.074
MARISHA: (laughs)

02:35:07.074 --> 02:35:08.274
MATT: Very different.

02:35:08.274 --> 02:35:10.884
SAM: I don't see it on the map that you sent.

02:35:10.884 --> 02:35:13.394
TRAVIS: It's tiny. So it's right under Foren.

02:35:13.394 --> 02:35:15.201
It's that little red dot.

02:35:15.201 --> 02:35:17.381
ASHLEY: What is it called?
TRAVIS: The word Foren. A4.

02:35:17.381 --> 02:35:19.091
SAM: Oh, that's where, A4, but that's--

02:35:19.091 --> 02:35:20.518
MARISHA: But where's the Vermus outpost?

02:35:20.518 --> 02:35:21.351
SAM: A Vermus--

02:35:21.351 --> 02:35:24.264
TRAVIS: That's the only thing
that's east of Aeor on the map.

02:35:24.264 --> 02:35:25.236
MARISHA: Oh, A4 is the only--

02:35:25.236 --> 02:35:27.474
TRAVIS: The Vermus outpost is not labeled on the map

02:35:27.474 --> 02:35:28.704
as far as I--

02:35:28.704 --> 02:35:32.594
MARISHA: Oh, he said he's east of Aeor, I see.

02:35:32.594 --> 02:35:34.754
LAURA: I'm going to--
MARISHA: At the Vermus outpost.

02:35:34.754 --> 02:35:36.325
LAURA: I'm going to up.

02:35:36.325 --> 02:35:37.294
Up.

02:35:37.294 --> 02:35:39.394
SAM: Oh.
LAURA: To Dagen's room.

02:35:39.394 --> 02:35:41.525
TRAVIS: Unless he's literally on the outskirts of Aeor.

02:35:41.525 --> 02:35:44.154
LAURA: (rapid knocking)

02:35:44.154 --> 02:35:46.417
MATT: "Hey, I was just starting to nod off.

02:35:46.417 --> 02:35:47.944
"What can I do for you?"
LAURA: I'm sorry.

02:35:47.944 --> 02:35:52.939
Have you heard of a Vermus outpost to the east?

02:35:55.614 --> 02:36:00.111
MATT: "Well, Vermus is actually a collection of ships

02:36:00.111 --> 02:36:05.111
"that the Dynasty usually has, travels occasionally

02:36:05.204 --> 02:36:06.627
"but it's usually out westward.

02:36:06.627 --> 02:36:08.534
"Yeah, an outpost.

02:36:08.534 --> 02:36:13.534
"There is a Dynasty outpost on
the eastern side of the crater of Aeor."

02:36:13.588 --> 02:36:14.421
LAURA: Okay!

02:36:15.574 --> 02:36:19.394
MATT: "Of course, steer clear of it, but I've seen it there.

02:36:19.394 --> 02:36:21.104
"If it was, if it's there still,

02:36:21.104 --> 02:36:25.295
"I mean, it was small enough for it might change location,

02:36:25.295 --> 02:36:29.042
"but it was about a four or five months ago last I saw it."

02:36:29.042 --> 02:36:31.863
LAURA: Okay. Thank you.

02:36:31.863 --> 02:36:33.184
TRAVIS: Shit. Oh, shit.

02:36:33.184 --> 02:36:34.092
LAURA: You can go back to sleep now.

02:36:34.092 --> 02:36:35.735
I'm sorry for waking you up!

02:36:35.735 --> 02:36:39.154
MATT: "I'll do my best,"

02:36:39.154 --> 02:36:40.344
and he slowly closes the door.

02:36:40.344 --> 02:36:43.274
His eyes still look a little haunted.

02:36:43.274 --> 02:36:45.291
LAURA: I really got to modify his memory.

02:36:47.444 --> 02:36:49.694
TRAVIS: Got to be careful what
we say around people, you guys.

02:36:49.694 --> 02:36:50.683
Come on.

02:36:50.683 --> 02:36:53.024
(laughter)

02:36:53.024 --> 02:36:54.584
LAURA: It's to the east of the crater.

02:36:54.584 --> 02:36:55.524
TRAVIS: Yeah. It's there.

02:36:55.524 --> 02:36:59.054
It's not A4, it's actually in that crater.

02:36:59.054 --> 02:37:00.705
So it's at Aeor.

02:37:00.705 --> 02:37:01.894
Or at least Essek is.

02:37:01.894 --> 02:37:02.967
TALIESIN: Very good news.

02:37:03.997 --> 02:37:06.114
MARISHA: I'm very glad we checked in on him,

02:37:07.139 --> 02:37:10.504
because running into him could've been awkward.

02:37:10.504 --> 02:37:11.808
TALIESIN: This is also a help from someone

02:37:11.808 --> 02:37:15.094
that we don't necessarily have to hide from.

02:37:15.094 --> 02:37:17.024
This is really good.

02:37:17.024 --> 02:37:19.274
This is somebody who could help us out a lot.

02:37:20.284 --> 02:37:21.711
LAURA: I'll call him in the morning again.

02:37:21.711 --> 02:37:23.002
SAM: Yeah, sure.
LAURA: Yeah.

02:37:24.384 --> 02:37:26.369
TRAVIS: So strange to have two warring nations

02:37:26.369 --> 02:37:30.461
both capable of help of some kind still--

02:37:31.694 --> 02:37:34.824
MARISHA: Everyone converging in on each other.

02:37:34.824 --> 02:37:35.894
TRAVIS: Again.

02:37:35.894 --> 02:37:37.379
MARISHA: Again.

02:37:37.379 --> 02:37:38.714
SAM: Fate.

02:37:38.714 --> 02:37:40.295
Destiny.

02:37:40.295 --> 02:37:42.467
Rhubarb.

02:37:42.467 --> 02:37:44.038
Episode title.

02:37:44.038 --> 02:37:44.876
(laughter)

02:37:44.876 --> 02:37:48.014
TALIESIN: So true. So very, very true.

02:37:48.014 --> 02:37:50.014
LIAM: The pies of Nein.

02:37:50.014 --> 02:37:52.443
MARISHA: The pies of Nein!

02:37:52.443 --> 02:37:55.815
TRAVIS: I smell Veth's pie dish, and it's just pure bourbon.

02:37:55.815 --> 02:37:58.628
(laughter)

02:37:58.628 --> 02:37:59.711
MARISHA: That's not rhubarb!

02:37:59.711 --> 02:38:01.074
LIAM: "Rhubarb."

02:38:01.074 --> 02:38:03.847
SAM: (drunkenly) We call it that where I'm from.

02:38:03.847 --> 02:38:04.988
LIAM: (like drunken Veth)
Merry Christmas!

02:38:04.988 --> 02:38:06.254
TALIESIN: Grandma's special pie.

02:38:07.819 --> 02:38:10.024
That pie's for grandma.
MARISHA: Yeah!

02:38:10.024 --> 02:38:13.551
(laughter)

02:38:13.551 --> 02:38:15.087
TRAVIS: Yes!

02:38:15.087 --> 02:38:17.480
(laughter)

02:38:17.480 --> 02:38:19.053
LIAM: That Wild Mother,

02:38:19.053 --> 02:38:21.432
they want you to call

02:38:21.432 --> 02:38:22.992
the Wild Mother!

02:38:22.992 --> 02:38:25.103
(laughter)

02:38:25.103 --> 02:38:27.194
TRAVIS: "That pie's for grandma."

02:38:27.194 --> 02:38:29.352
MATT: All right. So do you guys have
any other business for the evening,

02:38:29.352 --> 02:38:31.378
or are you going to rest?

02:38:31.378 --> 02:38:32.612
LAURA: We go to sleep?
MARISHA: So what does that mean?

02:38:32.612 --> 02:38:33.984
Are we going to continue to follow him

02:38:33.984 --> 02:38:34.864
and head towards A2,

02:38:34.864 --> 02:38:37.164
or do we want to swing wide and go to A4?

02:38:37.164 --> 02:38:38.806
LAURA: We'll call Essek in the morning.

02:38:38.806 --> 02:38:40.484
MARISHA: Okay. Okay. See what he's done?

02:38:40.484 --> 02:38:42.234
LIAM: Yeah, they're both north.

02:38:42.234 --> 02:38:45.014
I mean, it'd be a while before we'd have to split and pick.

02:38:45.014 --> 02:38:46.779
TRAVIS: I think Caleb and Veth were right.

02:38:46.779 --> 02:38:50.608
I mean, seems north is where we are bound to head.

02:38:50.608 --> 02:38:51.441
LAURA: Okay.

02:38:52.942 --> 02:38:55.842
LIAM: I, if no one else has anything,
I just have a minor thing.

02:38:55.842 --> 02:38:59.075
Before bed, I will go up to the

02:39:00.308 --> 02:39:01.849
eighth floor

02:39:03.765 --> 02:39:06.714
and go into that private floor.

02:39:06.714 --> 02:39:11.714
Iris opens up and go to <i>eins, zwei, drei, vier</i>.

02:39:12.076 --> 02:39:16.117
I will open that door and walk into

02:39:16.117 --> 02:39:18.692
a very small room

02:39:18.692 --> 02:39:21.694
with a single, Tudor-style window

02:39:21.694 --> 02:39:26.254
with glass to frost it over and opaque to see through.

02:39:26.254 --> 02:39:29.784
And sit down on a chair in front of a desk,

02:39:29.784 --> 02:39:32.784
looking at a bed in the room, a small bed,

02:39:32.784 --> 02:39:36.221
with the sheets completely ripped off and strewn about,

02:39:36.221 --> 02:39:38.914
and a pillow on the floor, and just sit in the chair

02:39:38.914 --> 02:39:43.884
and look at the bed for a while.

02:39:47.344 --> 02:39:49.494
What are we going to do about home?

02:39:57.624 --> 02:39:58.827
Can I trust you?

02:40:03.434 --> 02:40:04.831
Should I trust you?

02:40:11.292 --> 02:40:13.717
We could make it better,

02:40:18.134 --> 02:40:19.184
if you want to.

02:40:22.991 --> 02:40:25.433
And that's it. I'll quietly leave. Shut the door,

02:40:25.433 --> 02:40:27.984
float down to my bedroom and go to bed.

02:40:27.984 --> 02:40:28.817
MATT: Okay.

02:40:32.264 --> 02:40:34.921
As you all find various levels of comfort--

02:40:34.921 --> 02:40:39.832
LAURA: Oh, oh, Mittens, Benji, Cupid, Artemis--

02:40:39.832 --> 02:40:41.078
TRAVIS: Optimus?

02:40:41.078 --> 02:40:43.294
LAURA: And...
SAM: Optimus Prime.

02:40:44.267 --> 02:40:45.535
LAURA: Rudy.

02:40:45.535 --> 02:40:46.806
(laughter)

02:40:46.806 --> 02:40:47.735
ASHLEY: Rudy!

02:40:47.735 --> 02:40:48.823
MATT: Rudy!
TRAVIS: Rudy!

02:40:48.823 --> 02:40:51.974
LAURA: You're with me tonight, let's shnuggle.

02:40:51.974 --> 02:40:53.949
MATT: (cat noises)
TRAVIS: Rudy!

02:40:57.384 --> 02:41:02.192
MATT: Some in a cat cuddle, some poring over

02:41:02.192 --> 02:41:07.192
contentious choices to be made, lingering past shadows,

02:41:07.904 --> 02:41:12.904
and some revelations they didn't ask for,

02:41:13.464 --> 02:41:15.307
eventually sleep finds you all.

02:41:18.099 --> 02:41:19.306
And from there, we're going to go ahead and take a break.

02:41:19.306 --> 02:41:20.331
SAM: Oh.
LAURA: No!

02:41:20.331 --> 02:41:22.812
MATT: Be back here in just a few minutes to pick up

02:41:22.812 --> 02:41:24.641
this next leg of the journey,

02:41:24.641 --> 02:41:25.474
see where it takes us.

02:41:25.474 --> 02:41:26.554
LAURA: That was a long--

02:41:26.554 --> 02:41:27.570
MATT: See you in a few minutes.

02:41:28.170 --> 02:41:30.890
Now experience the ultimate way to play,

02:41:30.890 --> 02:41:33.880
by sitting in a table with your friends

02:41:33.880 --> 02:41:35.860
with your face in a screen.

02:41:35.860 --> 02:41:37.170
Progress!

02:41:37.170 --> 02:41:39.150
D&amp;D Beyond.

02:41:39.150 --> 02:41:43.100
Log in to explore strange worlds and fantastical cities,

02:41:43.100 --> 02:41:46.210
thanks to a company based in a really boring one

02:41:46.210 --> 02:41:47.610
that handles all the tedious

02:41:47.610 --> 02:41:49.380
math and reference stuff for you,

02:41:49.380 --> 02:41:51.770
so you can finally unleash the epic quest

02:41:51.770 --> 02:41:54.660
you've been crafting since middle school on your friends

02:41:54.660 --> 02:41:56.920
or just do what most people use it for,

02:41:56.920 --> 02:41:58.540
cranking out endless new characters

02:41:58.540 --> 02:41:59.787
while they're bored at work.

02:41:59.787 --> 02:42:01.560
"I could finish these spreadsheets

02:42:01.560 --> 02:42:04.086
but what if this paladin owned a horse?"

02:42:04.086 --> 02:42:06.987
(triumphant music)

02:42:06.987 --> 02:42:08.010
"Perfect."

02:42:08.010 --> 02:42:11.982
D&amp;D Beyond, play with advantage.

02:42:11.982 --> 02:42:14.690
Yes. Now they're drinking glizzies.

02:42:14.690 --> 02:42:16.217
What's a glizzy?

02:42:16.217 --> 02:42:20.290
It's a very popular pop culture thing right now

02:42:20.290 --> 02:42:21.262
for people to...

02:42:21.262 --> 02:42:22.780
(laughing) No it's not.

02:42:22.780 --> 02:42:24.702
Consume and talk about

02:42:24.702 --> 02:42:25.800
glizzies.
A glizzy.

02:42:25.800 --> 02:42:29.120
This whole ad team just comes up with names with Zs in it?

02:42:29.120 --> 02:42:29.953
Try this up.

02:42:29.953 --> 02:42:31.333
A grizzy.

02:42:31.333 --> 02:42:33.800
(laughing)

02:42:33.800 --> 02:42:35.530
Okay, okay. You don't like that one.

02:42:35.530 --> 02:42:37.166
How about a whizzy?

02:42:37.166 --> 02:42:39.416
(laughing)

02:42:42.466 --> 02:42:45.049
(upbeat music)

02:42:59.140 --> 02:43:01.310
Hey Critters, Laura Bailey here.

02:43:01.310 --> 02:43:03.693
Let's see what's up in the Critical Role shop.

02:43:04.900 --> 02:43:05.880
Glorious!

02:43:05.880 --> 02:43:07.740
It's perfect for the home

02:43:07.740 --> 02:43:10.363
or the office or your bathroom.

02:43:12.190 --> 02:43:13.680
Roll an investigation if you want.

02:43:13.680 --> 02:43:15.853
It's basically perfect.

02:43:18.200 --> 02:43:21.283
These holidays, you know, they're just around the corner.

02:43:23.900 --> 02:43:26.723
Oh my gosh, it's so amazing.

02:43:29.750 --> 02:43:31.690
This is, this is a lot of stuff, you guys.

02:43:31.690 --> 02:43:34.417
We have like so many cool things right now.

02:43:36.550 --> 02:43:39.182
So click on over to the Critical Role shop.

02:43:39.182 --> 02:43:41.610
Don't worry, there's a few more minutes in the break.

02:43:41.610 --> 02:43:42.909
You've still got time.

02:43:42.909 --> 02:43:46.058
(shopping channel music)

02:43:46.058 --> 02:43:48.808
(dramatic music)

02:44:20.550 --> 02:44:22.530
Huh. (chuckles)

02:44:22.530 --> 02:44:23.890
Would you look at that?

02:44:23.890 --> 02:44:25.300
I think it worked.

02:44:25.300 --> 02:44:27.340
You were right, Pumat Number Three.

02:44:27.340 --> 02:44:30.403
All we had to do Was invoke that subscription cantrip.

02:44:31.532 --> 02:44:32.743
Pumat Number Three?

02:44:35.760 --> 02:44:36.593
Oh boy.

02:44:36.593 --> 02:44:38.130
Well, hello there!

02:44:38.130 --> 02:44:39.630
I'm Pumat Prime.

02:44:39.630 --> 02:44:43.143
It's good to finally join you here in the prime dimension.

02:44:43.143 --> 02:44:48.143
I see this is the Twitch Prime realm, I think, and...

02:44:48.760 --> 02:44:52.030
oh, we're in the Critical Role channel, aren't we?

02:44:52.030 --> 02:44:53.410
Well, would you look at that.

02:44:53.410 --> 02:44:55.870
You got chat and everything.

02:44:55.870 --> 02:44:59.560
Respectfully, I was looking for the prime rib realm

02:44:59.560 --> 02:45:02.240
but this isn't too bad.

02:45:02.240 --> 02:45:04.500
You see, if you already have access

02:45:04.500 --> 02:45:07.550
to the Amazon Prime realm, you can get a free subscription

02:45:07.550 --> 02:45:10.390
to the channel of your choice in the Twitch Prime realm.

02:45:10.390 --> 02:45:13.210
The two realms have a pretty good working relationship

02:45:13.210 --> 02:45:15.710
after that peace treaty the prime minister signed

02:45:15.710 --> 02:45:17.310
a few years back.

02:45:17.310 --> 02:45:19.370
You just have to remember to renew

02:45:19.370 --> 02:45:20.650
your Twitch Prime subscription

02:45:20.650 --> 02:45:23.297
at the top of each month, respectfully.

02:45:23.297 --> 02:45:26.140
And hey, if you're already a subscriber,

02:45:26.140 --> 02:45:28.670
you can spread the joy by gifting a subscription

02:45:28.670 --> 02:45:31.410
using the "gift a sub" button.

02:45:31.410 --> 02:45:33.620
That is, assuming the empire hasn't

02:45:33.620 --> 02:45:35.820
sent the tax man to your shop here recently.

02:45:38.510 --> 02:45:39.840
All right, well, off to find

02:45:39.840 --> 02:45:42.230
that darn elusive prime rib realm.

02:45:42.230 --> 02:45:44.703
Who knew the prime dimension had so many pockets?

02:45:45.860 --> 02:45:46.693
Good luck.

02:45:49.644 --> 02:45:50.644
Pumat Three?

02:45:53.920 --> 02:45:56.257
Subscribe. Resubscribe.

02:46:00.850 --> 02:46:03.973
Brian Foster is not a cabbage.

02:59:31.163 --> 02:59:32.829
MATT: And welcome back.

02:59:32.829 --> 02:59:36.322
So, Mighty Nein.

02:59:36.322 --> 02:59:38.880
The morning comes, you all eventually wake

02:59:38.880 --> 02:59:40.171
and begin to rise.

02:59:40.171 --> 02:59:41.420
You come to get your breakfast

02:59:41.420 --> 02:59:45.253
and find awake before all of you is Dagen at the table

02:59:45.253 --> 02:59:47.669
with a hefty serving of coffee, just--

02:59:50.328 --> 02:59:51.936
"Oh hey, morning."

02:59:51.936 --> 02:59:52.769
TRAVIS: I slip up behind him

02:59:52.769 --> 02:59:54.463
and I shove the sword in the back of his neck.

02:59:54.463 --> 02:59:55.671
(laughter)

02:59:55.671 --> 02:59:57.446
MATT: Jesus Christ!

02:59:59.391 --> 03:00:00.891
It's the only way.

03:00:02.168 --> 03:00:03.751
LAURA: I'll go sit down with Dagen.

03:00:03.751 --> 03:00:05.301
LIAM: Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep.

03:00:05.301 --> 03:00:06.146
(laughter)

03:00:06.146 --> 03:00:06.979
MATT: "Mornin'."

03:00:06.979 --> 03:00:08.884
LAURA: Morning, how did you sleep?

03:00:08.884 --> 03:00:10.741
MATT: "Terrible."

03:00:10.741 --> 03:00:13.675
LAURA: Don't you think last night was so fun, though?

03:00:13.675 --> 03:00:15.253
MATT: "To a point, yeah."

03:00:15.253 --> 03:00:18.719
LAURA: Yeah. I pat his arm, and say,

03:00:18.719 --> 03:00:20.842
I thought the pies were delicious.

03:00:20.842 --> 03:00:23.821
I can't believe you ate so much.

03:00:23.821 --> 03:00:25.837
It makes sense that you would feel bad this morning,

03:00:25.837 --> 03:00:29.471
because you know, you probably
got kind of sick from all that pie.

03:00:29.471 --> 03:00:31.944
And I'll cast Modify Memory on him.

03:00:31.944 --> 03:00:33.494
MATT: You-- okay.

03:00:34.421 --> 03:00:36.200
He does not resist.

03:00:36.200 --> 03:00:38.078
(laughter)

03:00:38.078 --> 03:00:40.154
LIAM: (as Dagen) Oh, sweet relief.

03:00:40.154 --> 03:00:43.571
MATT: He goes, "Well I think the main problem...

03:00:45.457 --> 03:00:48.965
"was that I'm not used to eating so much sugary dishes

03:00:48.965 --> 03:00:50.448
"while we're out and about traveling,

03:00:50.448 --> 03:00:51.957
"and it just got to my stomach.

03:00:51.957 --> 03:00:53.762
"I didn't sleep well at all."
LAURA: I know.

03:00:53.762 --> 03:00:56.441
MATT: "Just tossing and turning. Man."

03:00:56.441 --> 03:00:57.584
LAURA: You get used to it.

03:00:57.584 --> 03:00:59.417
It gives you extra energy for the next day,

03:00:59.417 --> 03:01:01.589
and you know, we'll be cold. You'll be shivering a lot.

03:01:01.589 --> 03:01:03.735
So you'll probably need it.

03:01:03.735 --> 03:01:06.194
MATT: "Probably. Well, regardless.

03:01:08.386 --> 03:01:09.672
"Is there any more pie?"

03:01:09.672 --> 03:01:10.680
LAURA: (laughs)

03:01:10.680 --> 03:01:12.079
SAM: Breakfast pie?
LIAM: Breakfast pie, yeah.

03:01:12.079 --> 03:01:14.151
That can be arranged.
LAURA: Ooh, breakfast pie.

03:01:14.151 --> 03:01:17.021
Like a quiche, or-- but you could also do, you know

03:01:17.021 --> 03:01:17.979
how like breakfast pizza,

03:01:17.979 --> 03:01:19.684
so like it's like a scrambled egg

03:01:19.684 --> 03:01:21.029
with like bacon slices over top of it

03:01:21.029 --> 03:01:23.411
in a pie crust, oh my god.

03:01:23.411 --> 03:01:25.160
ASHLEY: What if like...
MARISHA: Breakfast pizza's so good.

03:01:25.160 --> 03:01:27.668
ASHLEY: What if like the bacon is like a pie latticework?

03:01:27.668 --> 03:01:28.893
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: Ooh.

03:01:28.893 --> 03:01:30.434
ASHLEY: You know?
LAURA: Let's do one of those.

03:01:30.434 --> 03:01:32.892
Let's do one of those, Caleb.
TALIESIN: Scrambled eggs and cheese.

03:01:32.892 --> 03:01:36.149
LAURA: Also breakfast pizza, also pancakes.

03:01:36.149 --> 03:01:37.591
LIAM: Okay.

03:01:37.591 --> 03:01:39.141
(ringing)

03:01:39.141 --> 03:01:40.299
SAM: Pancake pie.

03:01:41.323 --> 03:01:42.281
MATT: (meowing)

03:01:42.281 --> 03:01:43.546
LIAM: Good morning, Johann.

03:01:43.546 --> 03:01:46.464
MATT: (tired meowing)
LIAM: I have a very long list of food.

03:01:46.464 --> 03:01:50.391
I need waffles and pancakes
ASHLEY: Pancakes, yeah.

03:01:50.391 --> 03:01:53.487
LIAM: And just whatever leftover
pie that you guys did not eat

03:01:53.487 --> 03:01:55.303
after we had dinner last night.

03:01:55.303 --> 03:01:58.719
And also could we get like a breakfast quiche pie?

03:01:58.719 --> 03:01:59.777
That is--

03:01:59.777 --> 03:02:02.469
TRAVIS: Look at Johann.
Johann's an asshole.

03:02:02.469 --> 03:02:03.542
(laughter)

03:02:03.542 --> 03:02:06.281
TALIESIN: That's the look of a
cat who's considering unionizing.

03:02:07.648 --> 03:02:09.486
LIAM: Just a quiche, lots of egg,

03:02:09.486 --> 03:02:12.979
maybe put some capers in there as well.

03:02:12.979 --> 03:02:14.695
but then a lattice work--

03:02:14.695 --> 03:02:18.528
LAURA: Capers, Caleb you're going to put capers in a quiche?

03:02:18.528 --> 03:02:19.619
LIAM: (whispers) Put the capers in.

03:02:19.619 --> 03:02:21.419
And then a lattice work of bacon

03:02:21.419 --> 03:02:25.016
to, I guess, hide the flavor of the capers.

03:02:25.016 --> 03:02:26.413
TALIESIN: I'll just take the capers.

03:02:26.413 --> 03:02:28.697
MATT: As Johann turns--

03:02:28.697 --> 03:02:31.692
as Johann turns and acknowledges these six other cats

03:02:31.692 --> 03:02:33.716
around that all look at each other he goes,

03:02:34.658 --> 03:02:37.463
(resigned meow), and then heads off

03:02:37.463 --> 03:02:38.296
and they all follow suit.

03:02:38.296 --> 03:02:39.696
TRAVIS: He's the head of the union.

03:02:39.696 --> 03:02:41.646
(laughter)

03:02:41.646 --> 03:02:43.420
Shit's been going down at night.

03:02:43.420 --> 03:02:45.503
(laughter)

03:02:46.817 --> 03:02:48.900
MATT: They've been organizing for a few weeks now.

03:02:48.900 --> 03:02:52.420
LIAM: They're up in that hub room going-- (meowing).

03:02:52.420 --> 03:02:55.681
TRAVIS: Pancakes, pizza, what are they fucking crazy?

03:02:55.681 --> 03:02:57.486
MATT: Rightly so.
TRAVIS: We're killing ourselves.

03:02:57.486 --> 03:03:00.785
MATT: I'm excited for the Fae Cat Union
to present itself. It's gonna be good.

03:03:00.785 --> 03:03:03.145
LIAM: God, who knows what the chicken-making blue people did

03:03:03.145 --> 03:03:04.813
behind the scenes.

03:03:04.813 --> 03:03:07.892
TALIESIN: Oh man, I'd forgotten about that.

03:03:07.892 --> 03:03:09.933
MARISHA: What if like the next time--
ASHLEY: I have no idea what that means.

03:03:09.933 --> 03:03:14.137
SAM: That's my people, that's Scanlan's people

03:03:14.137 --> 03:03:16.843
were the chicken-making blue people.

03:03:16.843 --> 03:03:19.951
ASHLEY: Oh, duh!
TALIESIN: Way back, way back.

03:03:19.951 --> 03:03:21.998
MATT: To be fair--
ASHLEY: I have every idea of what that means.

03:03:21.998 --> 03:03:24.739
SAM: Just imagine-- just imagine Blue Man Group

03:03:24.739 --> 03:03:25.991
just holding chicken.

03:03:25.991 --> 03:03:28.466
ASHLEY: Oh yeah, we had all the chicken. I remember this.

03:03:28.466 --> 03:03:31.166
SAM: (drum noises)

03:03:31.166 --> 03:03:34.572
MATT: Perfect. But yes, the day is yours.

03:03:34.572 --> 03:03:39.489
Dagen eventually helps lead you out into the familiar snow.

03:03:40.790 --> 03:03:43.672
SAM: Oh, yes, can we see our-- can we see the other camp?

03:03:43.672 --> 03:03:45.605
Is the camp-- have they packed up and left?

03:03:45.605 --> 03:03:48.813
LIAM: I'm sorry, I just, I had a visual in my head

03:03:48.813 --> 03:03:51.608
and I have to share it before we move on with the story.

03:03:51.608 --> 03:03:54.210
Just Grog, standing, holding his mouth open

03:03:54.210 --> 03:03:57.043
and the blue spectral guys throwing Cornish hens,

03:03:57.043 --> 03:03:58.634
and them going (thudding).

03:03:58.634 --> 03:04:01.184
(laughter)

03:04:01.184 --> 03:04:03.536
I'm sorry.
MARISHA: Whole Cornish hens.

03:04:03.536 --> 03:04:04.652
MATT: There we go.
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:04:04.652 --> 03:04:06.402
MATT: Put it in the series.

03:04:09.593 --> 03:04:10.951
TRAVIS: We'll write that down.

03:04:10.951 --> 03:04:12.674
LIAM: As you were.
MATT: No worries.

03:04:12.674 --> 03:04:14.632
As you emerge, you discover that

03:04:14.632 --> 03:04:17.299
the fire is no longer lit.

03:04:17.299 --> 03:04:18.357
There's no smoke trail,

03:04:18.357 --> 03:04:21.782
and the camp appears to have been abandoned.

03:04:23.051 --> 03:04:27.553
MARISHA: Did we want to reach out
to Essek again before we go?

03:04:27.553 --> 03:04:29.644
SAM: Can you do it as we walk or do we have to be--

03:04:29.644 --> 03:04:31.036
LAURA: No, I can do it as we're walking.

03:04:31.036 --> 03:04:32.119
TRAVIS: Wait, wait.

03:04:33.802 --> 03:04:35.327
Put your hands on Beau's shoulders

03:04:35.327 --> 03:04:38.124
and I'll make sure your face doesn't--

03:04:38.124 --> 03:04:41.164
LAURA: Oh, I'm not scrying on Essek.

03:04:41.164 --> 03:04:42.847
I'm just sending him a message.

03:04:42.847 --> 03:04:43.952
TRAVIS: Yep.

03:04:43.952 --> 03:04:48.338
(laughter)

03:04:48.338 --> 03:04:50.577
I'm coming apart at the seams, you guys.

03:04:51.418 --> 03:04:53.001
MATT: It's been a week.
TRAVIS: Send help.

03:04:53.972 --> 03:04:57.407
LAURA: But should I see if he wants to meet us somewhere?

03:04:57.407 --> 03:04:58.639
Where's he heading?

03:04:58.639 --> 03:04:59.553
What should I ask him?

03:04:59.553 --> 03:05:01.541
TRAVIS: (as Jester) I try to talk.
MARISHA: I'm just trying to talk.

03:05:01.541 --> 03:05:05.467
TALIESIN: I'd say see if we can meet and talk.

03:05:05.467 --> 03:05:08.989
And that it's important and dangerous and happening fast.

03:05:08.989 --> 03:05:10.797
LAURA: Oh, that's all good stuff to say.

03:05:10.797 --> 03:05:14.108
LIAM: Heading north or heading your way, wondering if--

03:05:14.108 --> 03:05:15.183
SAM: Should we give him our position,

03:05:15.183 --> 03:05:16.963
in case he wants to come to us?

03:05:16.963 --> 03:05:17.996
LAURA: Well, we'll meet somewhere.

03:05:17.996 --> 03:05:19.758
What's a good meeting point from where he is?

03:05:19.758 --> 03:05:22.393
If he's at the East of Aeor crater.

03:05:22.393 --> 03:05:25.306
TRAVIS: Well, if we are half a day's north of A5,

03:05:25.306 --> 03:05:27.714
and if this is 10 days,

03:05:29.472 --> 03:05:31.955
there are-- there's like a little
mountain peak in the middle

03:05:31.955 --> 03:05:34.386
of Allowak's Sanctuary.

03:05:34.386 --> 03:05:36.183
Or we could meet at the flow shift.

03:05:36.183 --> 03:05:38.094
That's kind of a halfway point between--

03:05:38.094 --> 03:05:38.927
LAURA: Flow shift?

03:05:38.927 --> 03:05:40.618
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's where the magma seems to--

03:05:40.618 --> 03:05:42.688
the lava seems to come up and go out.

03:05:42.688 --> 03:05:46.648
LIAM: Or there's that entrance where the mountains part

03:05:46.648 --> 03:05:49.898
and into Aeor, maybe before going in at the--

03:05:49.898 --> 03:05:51.667
at the edge of the lava river there?

03:05:51.667 --> 03:05:53.575
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's almost three-quarters of the way there,

03:05:53.575 --> 03:05:54.446
but not all the way.
TALIESIN: But that would mean

03:05:54.446 --> 03:05:59.013
he possibly would have to cross the Tomb Takers, though.

03:05:59.013 --> 03:06:01.460
Maybe it's best if we just stay with them

03:06:01.460 --> 03:06:02.852
until we either get ahead of them,

03:06:02.852 --> 03:06:05.885
or until he doesn't have to

03:06:07.360 --> 03:06:09.802
meet them halfway before he gets to us.

03:06:12.231 --> 03:06:15.231
TRAVIS: Yeah, if he's on the Eastern part.

03:06:17.008 --> 03:06:18.699
LAURA: Whelp, I don't know what to tell him.

03:06:18.699 --> 03:06:20.245
SAM: Well, tell him where <i>we</i> are.
TRAVIS: As we get closer

03:06:20.245 --> 03:06:22.799
to the flow shift we can decide if we--

03:06:22.799 --> 03:06:25.343
MARISHA: See how it plays out, yeah?
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

03:06:25.343 --> 03:06:26.418
Essek!

03:06:29.918 --> 03:06:31.534
Do you want to meet us?

03:06:31.534 --> 03:06:33.614
Things are dangerous.

03:06:33.614 --> 03:06:34.906
It's important.

03:06:37.375 --> 03:06:38.450
SAM: Tell him where we are.

03:06:38.450 --> 03:06:40.119
LAURA: I don't know how to tell him where we are.

03:06:40.119 --> 03:06:42.402
SAM: Tell them where we just left.

03:06:42.402 --> 03:06:44.552
We just left--
TALIESIN: South of the--

03:06:44.552 --> 03:06:46.260
LAURA: We just left...

03:06:47.302 --> 03:06:50.335
A-- A5, whatever that means.

03:06:50.335 --> 03:06:53.223
Meet you by the flow change?

03:06:53.223 --> 03:06:55.193
SAM: Moving north.
LAURA: Moving north!

03:06:55.193 --> 03:06:56.967
MATT: (laughs)

03:06:57.817 --> 03:07:00.550
LAURA: That one did not go as well, I don't think.

03:07:01.758 --> 03:07:03.180
TRAVIS: You need to step up your game.

03:07:03.180 --> 03:07:04.781
LAURA: Stop trying to tell me what to say, when I'm--

03:07:04.781 --> 03:07:06.976
don't ask me questions when I'm sending messages!

03:07:06.976 --> 03:07:08.393
It's very distracting, Veth.
SAM: I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry,

03:07:08.393 --> 03:07:10.319
but you stopped halfway through the message

03:07:10.319 --> 03:07:12.550
and it looked like your nose was bleeding.

03:07:12.550 --> 03:07:14.102
(laughter)

03:07:14.102 --> 03:07:15.092
I'm sorry.

03:07:15.092 --> 03:07:16.509
MATT: Essek responds:

03:07:17.772 --> 03:07:22.747
MATT: "It is fortuitous that it seems our paths...

03:07:24.629 --> 03:07:27.546
"unite?" he says with a question.

03:07:29.102 --> 03:07:32.852
"I currently oversee this outpost

03:07:33.844 --> 03:07:35.810
"and cannot...

03:07:35.810 --> 03:07:36.643
"leave,

03:07:38.927 --> 03:07:42.436
"but feel free to visit."

03:07:44.377 --> 03:07:46.337
LAURA: He oversees the outpost?

03:07:46.337 --> 03:07:48.212
TRAVIS: Is he being punished?

03:07:48.212 --> 03:07:50.853
Is it like a Siberian outpost where they, like,

03:07:50.853 --> 03:07:52.086
send somebody who's in trouble?

03:07:52.086 --> 03:07:54.044
TALIESIN: It's a Siberian outpost on the giant crater full

03:07:54.044 --> 03:07:55.665
of esoteric magic.

03:07:55.665 --> 03:07:58.209
That doesn't seem like that much of a punishment.

03:07:58.209 --> 03:08:01.045
LIAM: He might be organizing excavation or--

03:08:01.045 --> 03:08:04.271
MARISHA: Maybe he's tasked with something big.

03:08:04.271 --> 03:08:05.671
Seems like a pretty big charge.

03:08:05.671 --> 03:08:06.504
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:08:07.634 --> 03:08:08.764
LAURA: So he's not going to meet us,

03:08:08.764 --> 03:08:11.075
but we can go there, he says.

03:08:11.075 --> 03:08:12.716
TALIESIN: I guess next message just warn him

03:08:12.716 --> 03:08:16.356
that the Tomb Takers are coming,

03:08:16.356 --> 03:08:19.035
and that whoever they sent south is dead now.

03:08:19.035 --> 03:08:20.852
LAURA: I'll-- oh right.

03:08:21.823 --> 03:08:23.856
I'll tell him that tomorrow.

03:08:25.047 --> 03:08:25.880
TALIESIN: Fair.

03:08:25.880 --> 03:08:29.814
LAURA: Or tonight, depending on
what kind of spells we need today.

03:08:31.824 --> 03:08:32.657
MATT: All right.

03:08:32.657 --> 03:08:34.949
MARISHA: So are we going to continue
north following behind them?

03:08:34.949 --> 03:08:36.458
At least for today?

03:08:36.458 --> 03:08:38.016
MATT: (as Dagen) "It looks like we still got tracks on them,

03:08:38.016 --> 03:08:39.749
"so we can keep following."

03:08:39.749 --> 03:08:41.160
LAURA: Yeah, let's do it.

03:08:41.160 --> 03:08:42.152
MATT: "All righty."

03:08:43.345 --> 03:08:44.385
TRAVIS: Dagen, a question.

03:08:44.385 --> 03:08:45.593
MATT: "Yeah."
TRAVIS: Are you planning to go

03:08:45.593 --> 03:08:47.164
eastward around these peaks in the middle

03:08:47.164 --> 03:08:50.244
of Allowak's Sanctuary or a westerly direction?

03:08:50.244 --> 03:08:52.214
Are you going to hug the lava river?

03:08:52.214 --> 03:08:54.684
MATT: "Well, I mean, it depends on what their--

03:08:54.684 --> 03:08:58.227
"their footsteps are takin' us necessarily.

03:08:58.227 --> 03:09:01.204
"If they're smart, they're going to avoid Allowak."

03:09:01.204 --> 03:09:03.729
TRAVIS: Oh, yes, of course.

03:09:03.729 --> 03:09:06.346
LIAM: What's the danger of Allowak?

03:09:06.346 --> 03:09:07.721
MATT: "Well, it's a--

03:09:07.721 --> 03:09:11.723
"it's a whole massive Yeti community

03:09:11.723 --> 03:09:15.016
"that generally wants to keep itself unknown.

03:09:15.016 --> 03:09:19.349
"I mean, we have-- we have an in to a certain extent.

03:09:20.358 --> 03:09:22.176
"I don't know about if your friends do or not."

03:09:22.176 --> 03:09:23.409
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

03:09:23.409 --> 03:09:25.844
What if we got to Allowak sanctuary,

03:09:25.844 --> 03:09:27.610
the Yetis help us get there,

03:09:27.610 --> 03:09:30.424
like, to the next location even faster,

03:09:30.424 --> 03:09:32.890
because remember the Yetis were super helpful.

03:09:34.340 --> 03:09:35.849
MATT: "Now, mind you, I'm just saying,

03:09:35.849 --> 03:09:37.244
"putting this out there from my experience

03:09:37.244 --> 03:09:41.131
"with what I've heard and seen out there,

03:09:41.131 --> 03:09:44.231
"them helping us get here was
very, you know, very fortuitous

03:09:44.231 --> 03:09:48.648
"given how things were going south real fast for them.

03:09:50.015 --> 03:09:53.829
"I don't know if they necessarily have any benefit

03:09:53.829 --> 03:09:56.453
"to helping us necessarily, but if you're feeling confident

03:09:56.453 --> 03:10:00.945
"in convincing them otherwise, you're a better man than I."

03:10:02.438 --> 03:10:05.330
MARISHA: You think if the Tomb Takers head that way,

03:10:05.330 --> 03:10:06.894
that it'll slow them down?

03:10:06.894 --> 03:10:11.544
You think that could potentially be
our opportunity to surpass them?

03:10:13.334 --> 03:10:16.876
MATT: "Well, I mean if-- they're likely-- once again,

03:10:16.876 --> 03:10:18.203
"we'll see how the tracks take us.

03:10:18.203 --> 03:10:23.201
"They're likely to probably head around the river as opposed

03:10:23.201 --> 03:10:26.890
"to the sanctuary since the Yetis are very territorial

03:10:26.890 --> 03:10:29.806
"and don't want folks...

03:10:31.556 --> 03:10:33.897
"knowing the exact location.

03:10:35.276 --> 03:10:37.235
"So if they're liable to go through there

03:10:37.235 --> 03:10:38.536
"there's a chance they might get spotted

03:10:38.536 --> 03:10:42.123
"and a confrontation will ensue, which would slow them down.

03:10:43.290 --> 03:10:46.977
"But once again, they're your friends, you tell me.

03:10:46.977 --> 03:10:49.072
"Or we just continue to follow the tracks."

03:10:49.072 --> 03:10:50.638
TRAVIS: We continue to follow, yeah?

03:10:50.638 --> 03:10:52.520
LAURA: Let's just keep going.

03:10:52.520 --> 03:10:54.578
TRAVIS: Don't need to over complicate.

03:10:54.578 --> 03:10:55.787
MATT: "All righty.

03:10:58.038 --> 03:10:59.148
"Get behind me."

03:10:59.148 --> 03:11:01.373
And he goes ahead and leads you on the path there--

03:11:01.373 --> 03:11:03.592
TRAVIS: By the way, Vess DeRogna's dead! I'm just kidding.

03:11:03.592 --> 03:11:04.719
(laughter)

03:11:04.719 --> 03:11:06.969
MATT: "What?!"
LAURA: Keep wasting my spells.

03:11:06.969 --> 03:11:09.396
MATT: Who wants to roll for this day's travel?

03:11:09.396 --> 03:11:11.062
LIAM: It's Travis's turn.
MARISHA: Yeah, your turn.

03:11:11.062 --> 03:11:12.337
TRAVIS: Oh, boy.

03:11:16.015 --> 03:11:18.732
♪ You're cold as ice ♪

03:11:18.732 --> 03:11:19.615
14.

03:11:20.569 --> 03:11:23.235
MATT: 14, all righty.

03:11:24.727 --> 03:11:27.313
Go ahead and roll a d8 for me.

03:11:27.313 --> 03:11:29.045
TRAVIS: It's totally fine, you guys.

03:11:29.045 --> 03:11:29.878
It's fine.

03:11:31.011 --> 03:11:31.844
One.

03:11:32.884 --> 03:11:35.063
LIAM: Here it is.
MATT: One.

03:11:35.063 --> 03:11:36.174
TRAVIS: What the fuck.
TALIESIN: Don't do that.

03:11:36.174 --> 03:11:38.103
That's not cool.
TRAVIS: It's fine, it's fine.

03:11:38.103 --> 03:11:39.293
LIAM: I'm sure it's probably fine.

03:11:39.293 --> 03:11:41.451
MATT: It's fine, it's fine.

03:11:42.818 --> 03:11:43.659
So--

03:11:43.659 --> 03:11:45.589
TRAVIS: The word is pronounced unimpeded.

03:11:45.589 --> 03:11:50.172
(laughter)

03:11:50.172 --> 03:11:52.330
TALIESIN: He's going to 'pede us.

03:11:52.330 --> 03:11:54.192
MATT: You're going to get so 'peded!

03:11:54.192 --> 03:11:55.859
You don't even know!

03:11:56.911 --> 03:12:00.653
No one's ever been quite as 'peded
as you're all about to be.

03:12:02.290 --> 03:12:06.097
Continuing onward for roughly a little over half

03:12:06.097 --> 03:12:10.130
of the day's travel, clear skies--

03:12:10.130 --> 03:12:14.722
well, clear as in the means that
there isn't any immediate snowfall.

03:12:14.722 --> 03:12:16.182
Occasionally, you see breaks in it.

03:12:16.182 --> 03:12:18.612
You see a little bit of blue peek through.

03:12:18.612 --> 03:12:22.558
The gray skies still tend to rule the horizon line,

03:12:22.558 --> 03:12:26.673
but the light snow has given away to clear.

03:12:27.665 --> 03:12:29.719
The temperature actually rises a bit.

03:12:29.719 --> 03:12:32.343
It's a hint of comfort, which is nice.

03:12:32.343 --> 03:12:34.310
MARISHA: Good one
LIAM: Psych.

03:12:35.674 --> 03:12:37.333
TRAVIS: It's the Wild Mother.

03:12:37.333 --> 03:12:39.677
MATT: At a certain point, Dagen goes--

03:12:39.677 --> 03:12:42.842
(laughter)

03:12:42.842 --> 03:12:46.542
As Dagen is currently making his way up this portion--

03:12:46.542 --> 03:12:49.807
you can see the area you're in has like some broken,

03:12:49.807 --> 03:12:51.983
broken frozen pond areas where it looks like some moisture

03:12:51.983 --> 03:12:56.019
has frozen into solid spaces, and he brings himself

03:12:56.019 --> 03:12:59.477
to the top of the hill before stopping, and...

03:13:04.029 --> 03:13:04.862
"No."

03:13:06.661 --> 03:13:07.494
LAURA: What?

03:13:08.466 --> 03:13:10.683
MATT: "Y'all here that?"

03:13:10.683 --> 03:13:13.267
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Do we?
LIAM: Should we be concerned?

03:13:13.267 --> 03:13:14.210
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:13:14.210 --> 03:13:16.590
LIAM: Yeah, I'm listening.
TRAVIS: I assisted him.

03:13:16.590 --> 03:13:18.445
I was with you.

03:13:18.445 --> 03:13:21.945
LAURA: I guided, Guidance.
MARISHA: I listened so hard.

03:13:26.170 --> 03:13:27.003
TALIESIN: 28.

03:13:28.101 --> 03:13:29.789
MATT: You definitely hear it.

03:13:29.789 --> 03:13:31.024
There's a-- it's weird.

03:13:31.024 --> 03:13:34.932
It's this, at first sounds like a

03:13:34.932 --> 03:13:37.765
sourceless muffled grinding sound.

03:13:39.300 --> 03:13:43.300
TALIESIN: It's like a sourceless muffled grinding sound.

03:13:44.292 --> 03:13:45.884
MATT: It's very faint.

03:13:45.884 --> 03:13:48.284
SAM: SMGS? Oh no.

03:13:48.284 --> 03:13:49.117
MATT: And you--

03:13:49.117 --> 03:13:49.950
TALIESIN: Can we-- yeah, go ahead.

03:13:49.950 --> 03:13:52.622
MATT: You here on top of it in short bursts

03:13:52.622 --> 03:13:56.192
this odd, high-pitched trill.

03:13:56.192 --> 03:13:59.554
This like a (purring bursts).

03:13:59.554 --> 03:14:00.755
It's almost insect-like.

03:14:00.755 --> 03:14:02.922
It's weird and it's faint.

03:14:04.800 --> 03:14:07.727
And both are getting steadily louder.

03:14:07.727 --> 03:14:09.988
LAURA: Oh, are these those scary snow worms

03:14:09.988 --> 03:14:11.905
you were talking about?

03:14:13.141 --> 03:14:14.377
MATT: "Grab a weapon, because I think

03:14:14.377 --> 03:14:16.223
"that's exactly what it might be."

03:14:16.223 --> 03:14:17.191
LAURA: Oh god.

03:14:17.191 --> 03:14:18.909
MARISHA: Can we get on defense

03:14:18.909 --> 03:14:20.283
or something like that?
TRAVIS: Circle back to back.

03:14:20.283 --> 03:14:22.620
MATT: "Yeah, back to back is something I haven't--

03:14:22.620 --> 03:14:25.020
"whatever you do, stop moving."

03:14:27.941 --> 03:14:29.541
TRAVIS: You want to cast some ring of something shit.

03:14:29.541 --> 03:14:31.106
LAURA: I'm going to cast Spiritual Weapon--

03:14:31.106 --> 03:14:33.047
I mean, no, Spiritual Guardians.

03:14:33.047 --> 03:14:35.229
SAM: I'm going to cast Levitate.

03:14:35.229 --> 03:14:36.572
MATT: All right, you cast Levitate.

03:14:36.572 --> 03:14:39.789
You're going to cast Spirit Guardians.

03:14:39.789 --> 03:14:42.190
TALIESIN: I'm also going to put up Spirit Guardians as well.

03:14:42.190 --> 03:14:44.701
TRAVIS: Sword is out. Galas-var!
LAURA: 5th-level.

03:14:44.701 --> 03:14:47.125
MATT: Yep, Sheila's out.

03:14:47.125 --> 03:14:49.220
MARISHA: Patient Defense, can I do that?

03:14:49.220 --> 03:14:50.905
Or I'll just defend.
MATT: You can spend your action

03:14:50.905 --> 03:14:52.577
to dodge, if you want to.
MARISHA: Yeah, to dodge.

03:14:52.577 --> 03:14:53.654
MATT: As you all stand there

03:14:53.654 --> 03:14:55.877
with the hint of ice glittering.

03:14:55.877 --> 03:15:00.527
You watch as the surface in which elements of small snow

03:15:00.527 --> 03:15:05.527
and ice flecks start clattering across the surface.

03:15:05.866 --> 03:15:08.744
You begin to feel the vibration of the ground beneath you.

03:15:08.744 --> 03:15:13.717
Dagen just sits there and takes a big gulp and goes,

03:15:13.717 --> 03:15:16.515
"Unfortunately, I think I was right."

03:15:16.515 --> 03:15:17.872
(crashing)
(screaming)

03:15:17.872 --> 03:15:19.230
Out of the ground to the right of your group,

03:15:19.230 --> 03:15:22.811
you watch as a spray of white snow ice and dirt

03:15:22.811 --> 03:15:26.437
is thrown 20, 30, 40 feet in the air

03:15:26.437 --> 03:15:28.645
in this massive explosion.

03:15:28.645 --> 03:15:30.791
You all immediately recoil and glance up

03:15:30.791 --> 03:15:35.307
as you see this massive swollen white armored mass of flesh,

03:15:35.307 --> 03:15:39.157
as you see this massive swollen white armored mass of flesh,

03:15:39.157 --> 03:15:41.900
pinkish and red, poking through this

03:15:41.900 --> 03:15:45.327
white armored carcass-like exterior.

03:15:45.327 --> 03:15:48.762
As it rises up, the top curls back down,

03:15:48.762 --> 03:15:52.380
you see a singular angry burning eye in the middle

03:15:52.380 --> 03:15:55.523
of its faces as its jaw splits open.

03:15:55.523 --> 03:15:57.460
(shrill shrieking)

03:15:57.460 --> 03:15:59.056
(exclaiming)

03:15:59.056 --> 03:16:01.672
MATT: That weird trill sound--
TRAVIS: Oh no! He's close to me.

03:16:01.672 --> 03:16:03.077
MATT: -- strikes the air and your ears feel

03:16:03.077 --> 03:16:05.875
like they're about to burst for a moment.

03:16:05.875 --> 03:16:08.793
I need you all to roll initiative.
(cheering)

03:16:08.793 --> 03:16:10.315
TRAVIS: Hey, what the fuck was that, though?

03:16:10.315 --> 03:16:12.333
LIAM: Way to go, Travis.
SAM: That was incredible.

03:16:12.333 --> 03:16:14.861
LAURA: I like how we always get
fights when Travis is in charge.

03:16:14.861 --> 03:16:16.410
TRAVIS: You're welcome.
SAM: Guys, transform your

03:16:16.410 --> 03:16:18.610
gaming table into what you see here

03:16:18.610 --> 03:16:20.568
on the Critical Role with your

03:16:20.568 --> 03:16:22.241
friends at Dwarven Forge.
LAURA: "On the Critical Role."

03:16:22.241 --> 03:16:25.725
SAM: Check out their amazing stuff at dwarvenforge.com.

03:16:25.725 --> 03:16:27.936
They have ice stuff.
ASHLEY: Whoa.

03:16:27.936 --> 03:16:30.447
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: Forgen Dwarve, you say?

03:16:30.447 --> 03:16:32.776
MATT: Where would you guys like to be situated, I suppose?

03:16:32.776 --> 03:16:35.127
LIAM: Far away from the worm.

03:16:35.127 --> 03:16:36.451
SAM: I'm 20 feet in the air.
TRAVIS: Is that a frozen lake

03:16:36.451 --> 03:16:37.396
that we are near?

03:16:37.396 --> 03:16:40.906
MATT: That is patch of frozen moisture and water.

03:16:40.906 --> 03:16:43.332
It's not terribly large, but that's
just a corner of it there.

03:16:44.684 --> 03:16:47.380
TRAVIS: I guess-- are we in a--
we're back to back, so I guess.

03:16:47.380 --> 03:16:50.232
MATT: I'll place you guys here.

03:16:50.232 --> 03:16:51.065
TRAVIS: Dead middle's good.

03:16:51.065 --> 03:16:53.441
MATT: And you tell me if you want to change

03:16:53.441 --> 03:16:54.274
or shift any of this.

03:16:54.274 --> 03:16:55.107
I'm just telling you

03:16:55.107 --> 03:16:57.547
where you are currently, you know...

03:16:57.547 --> 03:16:59.970
TRAVIS: We could probably move 10 feet away from the water.

03:16:59.970 --> 03:17:01.502
Yeah? The frozen--
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

03:17:01.502 --> 03:17:03.079
MARISHA: I'm fine with that.
LAURA: (with a rising pitch) Do we?

03:17:03.079 --> 03:17:04.182
TRAVIS: (as Laura) "Do we?"
LAURA: Or do we want to be

03:17:04.182 --> 03:17:06.248
close to the water?

03:17:06.248 --> 03:17:08.148
(battle horn sounds)

03:17:08.148 --> 03:17:11.967
MATT: I'm saying as far as party arrangement goes.

03:17:13.247 --> 03:17:14.130
LAURA: I'm happy.

03:17:14.130 --> 03:17:15.699
LIAM: Back me up against that spike

03:17:15.699 --> 03:17:19.109
by Veth and Fjord more, please.

03:17:19.109 --> 03:17:20.884
Yes, thank you.
MATT: All right.

03:17:20.884 --> 03:17:23.009
SAM: Put me 20 feet in the air.

03:17:23.009 --> 03:17:25.679
MATT: That's right because you are levitating.

03:17:25.679 --> 03:17:27.029
SAM: <i>Levitato</i>.

03:17:28.919 --> 03:17:30.634
TRAVIS: Demi Levitato.
LIAM: Me and the village of Vo.

03:17:30.634 --> 03:17:33.754
TALIESIN: And we have two spells up already,

03:17:33.754 --> 03:17:35.796
two defensive spells.
LAURA: Yeah, we have two Spirit Guardians.

03:17:35.796 --> 03:17:37.551
MATT: Yes, you do. Both of them?

03:17:37.551 --> 03:17:38.442
LAURA: Yeah.

03:17:39.833 --> 03:17:40.904
SAM: King of the North.

03:17:40.904 --> 03:17:43.825
TALIESIN: They're both the same, pretty much.

03:17:43.825 --> 03:17:44.809
TRAVIS: King of the North.

03:17:44.809 --> 03:17:46.216
MATT: You guys do have separate radiuses.

03:17:46.216 --> 03:17:48.500
TALIESIN: Yeah, slightly separate.

03:17:52.487 --> 03:17:55.934
MATT: All right, anybody wish to be placed separately?

03:17:55.934 --> 03:17:58.592
TRAVIS: I don't think so...
LAURA: Nah, let's just--

03:17:58.592 --> 03:18:00.524
we were back to back.

03:18:00.524 --> 03:18:02.441
MATT: That's what you said.

03:18:03.275 --> 03:18:05.170
That'll put you about there.
SAM: Is Dagen in there?

03:18:05.170 --> 03:18:06.245
MATT: Dagen is.

03:18:10.470 --> 03:18:11.503
LAURA: Oh.
TALIESIN: Nope.

03:18:11.503 --> 03:18:12.568
SAM: That's not Dagen.

03:18:12.568 --> 03:18:15.433
LAURA: Oh my lord.
TRAVIS: What the fuck is that?

03:18:15.433 --> 03:18:18.717
LAURA: It's a purple worm.
TRAVIS: You're missing part of its mouth.

03:18:18.717 --> 03:18:20.184
LIAM: That ain't a purple worm.

03:18:20.184 --> 03:18:21.676
LAURA: Well, it is technically.

03:18:21.676 --> 03:18:23.951
TALIESIN: It is definitely one-eyed
and a purple people eater.

03:18:23.951 --> 03:18:26.516
TRAVIS: That thing is cool!

03:18:26.516 --> 03:18:28.233
LAURA: This is the thing we fought before, right?

03:18:28.233 --> 03:18:29.549
The kind of thing--
MATT: Nope.

03:18:29.549 --> 03:18:30.382
LAURA: Something different?

03:18:30.382 --> 03:18:31.215
MATT: Something different.

03:18:31.215 --> 03:18:33.105
ASHLEY: Ew, he's coming out of the ground.

03:18:33.105 --> 03:18:34.727
LIAM: Look, he's got homemade snow

03:18:34.727 --> 03:18:36.264
glued to his foot.
ASHLEY: That's so cool.

03:18:36.264 --> 03:18:38.692
MATT: All right, so since he did emerge

03:18:38.692 --> 03:18:40.378
into the Spirit Guardians that you've,

03:18:40.378 --> 03:18:43.951
oh shouldn't he be-- yeah, he'd be touching it there.

03:18:43.951 --> 03:18:45.697
He was in the radius, so.

03:18:45.697 --> 03:18:47.411
TALIESIN: Now if he walks into the radius,

03:18:47.411 --> 03:18:50.031
then he has to make a save.
MATT: And he starts his turn there.

03:18:50.031 --> 03:18:51.904
TALIESIN and LAURA: Yeah.

03:18:51.904 --> 03:18:53.525
MATT: Though you cast it before he emerged,

03:18:53.525 --> 03:18:55.864
so technically he would enter it now. So is it wisdom save?

03:18:55.864 --> 03:18:57.257
TALIESIN: It's a wisdom save.

03:18:57.257 --> 03:18:59.470
MATT: Wisdom, that is a failure.

03:18:59.470 --> 03:19:00.838
How much damage does it take?

03:19:00.838 --> 03:19:03.614
TALIESIN: That's a bunch of d8s.

03:19:03.614 --> 03:19:07.964
LAURA: And he-- is it the same resistance for mine?

03:19:07.964 --> 03:19:10.270
MATT: He is not quite in your radius yet.

03:19:10.270 --> 03:19:11.720
TALIESIN: So that's...

03:19:22.666 --> 03:19:24.715
TALIESIN: 20 points of radiant damage.

03:19:24.715 --> 03:19:26.365
MATT: 20 points, nice.

03:19:27.474 --> 03:19:28.307
Now...

03:19:34.760 --> 03:19:36.510
Initiative, 25 to 20.

03:19:36.510 --> 03:19:37.576
MARISHA: 23.

03:19:37.576 --> 03:19:39.060
MATT: 23.
SAM: 23!

03:19:39.060 --> 03:19:41.060
(impressed sounds)

03:19:44.789 --> 03:19:46.019
MATT: 20 to 15?

03:19:46.019 --> 03:19:47.267
LIAM: 18.

03:19:47.267 --> 03:19:48.334
MATT: 18.

03:19:50.266 --> 03:19:52.076
TRAVIS: 15.

03:19:52.076 --> 03:19:53.076
MATT: All right.

03:19:58.663 --> 03:20:00.243
15 to 10.

03:20:00.243 --> 03:20:02.443
ASHLEY: 13.
TALIESIN: 12.

03:20:05.792 --> 03:20:08.917
MATT: And Jester?

03:20:08.917 --> 03:20:10.356
LAURA: Oh, seven.

03:20:10.356 --> 03:20:11.531
MATT: All righty.

03:20:13.982 --> 03:20:16.649
Beau and Veth, you are up first.

03:20:17.569 --> 03:20:18.652
MARISHA: All right.

03:20:19.964 --> 03:20:22.106
SAM: Ladies first, so I'll go.

03:20:22.106 --> 03:20:23.377
MARISHA: Sure, go for it.

03:20:23.377 --> 03:20:28.033
SAM: I'll do-- I'll bonus action Brenatto's Voltaic Bolt,

03:20:28.033 --> 03:20:29.383
and I will

03:20:31.483 --> 03:20:33.508
hold my shot

03:20:34.924 --> 03:20:38.259
until it is in--
MARISHA: See if I get a Stunning Strike?

03:20:38.259 --> 03:20:42.571
SAM: -- melee combaty sort of whatever with an ally,

03:20:42.571 --> 03:20:43.798
so I can get sneak attack.

03:20:43.798 --> 03:20:46.357
MATT: Okay, fair enough.
ASHLEY: You're not going to give away your shot?

03:20:47.607 --> 03:20:50.665
SAM: I'm not going to throw it away.

03:20:50.665 --> 03:20:51.787
MATT: But give it away, give it away,

03:20:51.787 --> 03:20:53.218
give it away, give it away now.

03:20:53.218 --> 03:20:54.645
All right, so is that your turn?

03:20:54.645 --> 03:20:56.015
You're going to stay put?
SAM: Absolutely, yes.

03:20:56.015 --> 03:20:57.611
MATT: Floating in the air.

03:20:57.611 --> 03:21:00.288
SAM: Oh, and I'll
♪ rise up. ♪ Oh my god. ♪

03:21:00.288 --> 03:21:03.530
(laughter)

03:21:03.530 --> 03:21:04.552
MATT: Damn it.

03:21:05.880 --> 03:21:08.385
MARISHA: I love how mad at yourself you were.

03:21:08.385 --> 03:21:09.741
TRAVIS: "Oh god."
MARISHA: "Oh my god."

03:21:09.741 --> 03:21:10.603
(laughter)

03:21:10.603 --> 03:21:11.587
MATT: That was pretty bad.

03:21:11.587 --> 03:21:13.732
TRAVIS: Years, it's been years.

03:21:13.732 --> 03:21:15.800
MATT: All righty, that finishes your turn.

03:21:15.800 --> 03:21:17.556
SAM: That's it.
MATT: Beau, whatcha doing?

03:21:17.556 --> 03:21:20.201
MARISHA: Okay, I look at Veth, knowing what's happening,

03:21:20.201 --> 03:21:21.968
and knowing what she's waiting for, I'm going to run.

03:21:21.968 --> 03:21:24.398
I'm going to jump and I'm going to swing wide around

03:21:24.398 --> 03:21:28.618
to the other side of the wormy worm,

03:21:28.618 --> 03:21:31.479
if I can move around this--

03:21:31.479 --> 03:21:33.169
its backside a bit, I guess.
MATT: All right, over here?

03:21:33.169 --> 03:21:34.269
MARISHA: Whatever works.
MATT: You definitely have enough

03:21:34.269 --> 03:21:35.102
movement for that, yeah.

03:21:35.102 --> 03:21:36.002
MARISHA: Fine, yeah.

03:21:36.002 --> 03:21:40.078
Whatever-- does that give you what you need?

03:21:40.078 --> 03:21:41.300
SAM: As long as you're engaged,

03:21:41.300 --> 03:21:42.597
I think that gives me sneak attack.

03:21:42.597 --> 03:21:44.063
MATT: Yeah, so you can take your shot.

03:21:44.063 --> 03:21:45.621
SAM: I will take my shot.

03:21:46.559 --> 03:21:48.525
I am not going to take my shot

03:21:49.434 --> 03:21:52.159
because that was a 14?

03:21:52.159 --> 03:21:54.879
MATT: 14. As you're lifting up, you lift to the side

03:21:54.879 --> 03:21:57.074
and as soon as Beauregard moves around it,

03:21:57.074 --> 03:21:59.055
you see its head (clicking) in your direction.

03:21:59.055 --> 03:22:00.527
You (screams) and you fire,

03:22:00.527 --> 03:22:03.287
and it just glances off of its armored shell.

03:22:03.287 --> 03:22:04.472
No impact, unfortunately.

03:22:04.472 --> 03:22:06.607
MARISHA: Shit.
SAM: Oh, well.

03:22:06.607 --> 03:22:08.708
MATT: Beauregard.
MARISHA: I'm going to use that distraction,

03:22:08.708 --> 03:22:10.672
as it's looking at a looking at Veth,

03:22:10.672 --> 03:22:13.024
and I'm going to come up and I'm going to do two big

03:22:13.024 --> 03:22:16.000
sweeping, upward strikes with my staff.

03:22:16.000 --> 03:22:16.833
MATT: Go for it. Roll for an attack.

03:22:16.833 --> 03:22:18.855
LAURA: Just be like (grunting).

03:22:18.855 --> 03:22:20.880
MARISHA: (unsure grunting)

03:22:20.880 --> 03:22:23.230
SAM: (weak grunting)

03:22:24.440 --> 03:22:28.190
MARISHA: 26 and 20-- nope,

03:22:28.190 --> 03:22:30.290
yeah, 26 and 22.

03:22:30.290 --> 03:22:31.784
MATT: Both hit, go ahead and roll damage.

03:22:31.784 --> 03:22:33.121
MARISHA: Yeah, they weren't too bad.

03:22:33.121 --> 03:22:35.834
(dramatic background music)

03:22:35.834 --> 03:22:39.059
(singing along to background music)

03:22:39.059 --> 03:22:40.035
MARISHA: Those were both seven,

03:22:40.035 --> 03:22:44.595
so 14 plus another, plus eight for both of those,

03:22:44.595 --> 03:22:47.828
so 14 plus 16 is definitely 30.

03:22:49.280 --> 03:22:51.080
Yeah, 30 points.
MATT: So as you crack--

03:22:51.080 --> 03:22:52.567
MARISHA: And Stunning Strike on that first one.

03:22:52.567 --> 03:22:56.909
MATT: Okay, that is a--

03:22:59.408 --> 03:23:02.164
(laughs) it's a 17 still.

03:23:02.164 --> 03:23:05.481
MARISHA: Fuck, Stunning Strike again on the second one.

03:23:06.564 --> 03:23:11.314
MATT: Okay. Oh, much higher.

03:23:11.314 --> 03:23:13.030
MARISHA: Fuck!
MATT: Yeah.

03:23:14.166 --> 03:23:15.805
You also take 22 points of cold damage.

03:23:15.805 --> 03:23:17.217
MARISHA: Fuck!
TRAVIS: For hitting it?

03:23:17.217 --> 03:23:20.060
MATT: As you hit it with one strike the--

03:23:20.060 --> 03:23:21.193
you realize at that point,

03:23:21.193 --> 03:23:23.240
there is an aura of extremely cold frost

03:23:23.240 --> 03:23:26.057
similar to the elementals that you fought before,

03:23:26.057 --> 03:23:28.818
but even more intense, and as you strike it with a blow

03:23:28.818 --> 03:23:30.925
it bursts back in your face.

03:23:30.925 --> 03:23:32.614
(grunts) You angrily spin with the other hit,

03:23:32.614 --> 03:23:33.454
and it bursts back again,

03:23:33.454 --> 03:23:35.673
and all of a sudden you realize there's frost gathered

03:23:35.673 --> 03:23:37.622
around your shoulders and your jaw

03:23:37.622 --> 03:23:39.018
and your front of your hair and your brows.

03:23:39.018 --> 03:23:41.010
Your eyes you have to close for fear

03:23:41.010 --> 03:23:44.004
of the moisture in them freezing solid.

03:23:44.004 --> 03:23:46.039
It hurt.
TRAVIS: Whoa.

03:23:46.039 --> 03:23:47.182
MATT: You have your bonus action still.

03:23:47.182 --> 03:23:51.381
MARISHA: 22 points of cold damage?
MATT: Of cold damage.

03:23:51.381 --> 03:23:52.548
TRAVIS: Fuck a duck.

03:23:55.319 --> 03:23:56.706
I see that math happening.

03:23:56.706 --> 03:24:00.789
MARISHA: Yeah, if he got a 17 and then he rolled higher.

03:24:05.365 --> 03:24:10.232
SAM: (whistles background music)

03:24:12.977 --> 03:24:14.936
MARISHA: Do I feel like it was because I was hitting him,

03:24:14.936 --> 03:24:17.197
like in contact-- it was a melee contact?

03:24:17.197 --> 03:24:18.512
MATT: It did feel like that,

03:24:18.512 --> 03:24:21.310
or at least it was when you struck it,

03:24:21.310 --> 03:24:22.996
it blasted back into you.

03:24:22.996 --> 03:24:27.427
The cold seemed to react to the impact.

03:24:27.427 --> 03:24:29.849
TRAVIS: When you punched it,
the skin on your knuckles stayed there.

03:24:29.849 --> 03:24:31.215
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:24:31.215 --> 03:24:33.498
I'm going to do--

03:24:33.498 --> 03:24:36.953
is it an action to turn on my--

03:24:36.953 --> 03:24:38.731
I don't know if it is.

03:24:38.731 --> 03:24:39.973
TALIESIN: Feel like like it's a bonus action.

03:24:39.973 --> 03:24:42.137
MARISHA: "At the start of your turn,"
I can-- at the start of my turn.

03:24:42.137 --> 03:24:42.970
MATT: At the start of your turn, so you

03:24:42.970 --> 03:24:45.796
can't activate it this turn.
MARISHA: So I'm just going to Patient Defense.

03:24:45.796 --> 03:24:47.758
MATT: Okay, Patient Defense, you got it.

03:24:47.758 --> 03:24:51.090
Finishing Beau's go and Veth finished hers.

03:24:51.090 --> 03:24:53.658
Caleb, you're up; Fjord, you're on deck.

03:24:53.658 --> 03:24:57.337
LIAM: I pull out a pinch of iron powder and look to Yasha

03:24:57.337 --> 03:24:59.100
and just stretch my hands out.

03:24:59.100 --> 03:25:01.209
And the dust scatters in front of you.

03:25:01.209 --> 03:25:03.889
And she grows to twice her size.

03:25:03.889 --> 03:25:06.674
And I start to just slide around

03:25:06.674 --> 03:25:09.828
and behind that fragment of stone on the edge of the ice.

03:25:09.828 --> 03:25:13.701
MATT: That pushes Caduceus back a bit as well as shoving--

03:25:13.701 --> 03:25:15.301
LIAM: Attack of the 50-foot woman.

03:25:15.301 --> 03:25:17.801
LAURA: Oh shit, you already had one?!
MATT: Indeed.

03:25:19.264 --> 03:25:21.015
LIAM: And I want to get on the other side

03:25:21.015 --> 03:25:25.777
of that tallest stone to block myself from the worm.

03:25:25.777 --> 03:25:26.985
Yeah.
MATT: Over here, you mean?

03:25:26.985 --> 03:25:28.558
LIAM: Yeah, on the edge of the ice.

03:25:28.558 --> 03:25:29.391
MATT: Okay, you got it.

03:25:29.391 --> 03:25:30.452
LIAM: <i>Danke!</i>

03:25:30.452 --> 03:25:31.903
MATT: You are right against the edge where it begins to

03:25:31.903 --> 03:25:33.713
slip down under the sheet, so.

03:25:33.713 --> 03:25:37.696
MARISHA: Yasha. Yaas-sha.

03:25:37.696 --> 03:25:39.846
ASHLEY: Yaaas-sha.

03:25:41.190 --> 03:25:42.889
MATT: All righty, that finishes Caleb's go.

03:25:42.889 --> 03:25:44.285
Fjord, you're up.
LIAM: Look how big she is!

03:25:44.285 --> 03:25:46.636
TRAVIS: Awesome, I am going to use

03:25:46.636 --> 03:25:51.174
all 30 feet to run out to the side here in this direction.

03:25:51.174 --> 03:25:55.091
Kind of spread out the group just a titty bit.

03:25:57.713 --> 03:25:58.630
MATT: 30, you can get there.

03:25:58.630 --> 03:26:00.765
TRAVIS: Great, and I will--

03:26:00.765 --> 03:26:03.969
I'll have the runes on the Star Razor pulse,

03:26:03.969 --> 03:26:07.269
and I will cast Faerie Fire

03:26:07.269 --> 03:26:09.808
against this big-ass worm.

03:26:09.808 --> 03:26:11.591
MATT: You got it. Is that a dex save?

03:26:11.591 --> 03:26:14.850
TRAVIS: It is, yes.

03:26:14.850 --> 03:26:17.608
MATT: That is a fail, I'm pretty sure. It's a five.

03:26:17.608 --> 03:26:19.373
TRAVIS: 15, great.

03:26:19.373 --> 03:26:21.135
SAM: Does Faerie Fire stay with them,

03:26:21.135 --> 03:26:23.573
or is it the area that they're currently in?

03:26:23.573 --> 03:26:25.127
LIAM: No, stays with.
TRAVIS: Stays with them.

03:26:25.127 --> 03:26:26.325
It's concentration.

03:26:26.325 --> 03:26:27.913
A 20-foot cube, so I'll just put it

03:26:27.913 --> 03:26:30.500
so that the corner of it is on the worm

03:26:30.500 --> 03:26:32.559
and not on Beau or Yasha or Caduceus.

03:26:32.559 --> 03:26:33.898
LIAM: That means advantage for everyone's attacks, right?

03:26:33.898 --> 03:26:34.731
TRAVIS: It does.

03:26:34.731 --> 03:26:36.668
MARISHA: Fuck yeah.
LIAM: Game on.

03:26:36.668 --> 03:26:37.898
LAURA: We all get advantage?
MARISHA: Such a great spell.

03:26:37.898 --> 03:26:38.966
TRAVIS: Yeah, it can't go invisible.

03:26:38.966 --> 03:26:42.572
And it'll glow green.

03:26:42.572 --> 03:26:43.559
MATT: It'll glow green?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:26:43.559 --> 03:26:45.244
MATT: I will actually switch out--

03:26:45.244 --> 03:26:47.151
LAURA: Ooh!

03:26:47.151 --> 03:26:48.467
TRAVIS: Oh!

03:26:48.467 --> 03:26:49.972
SAM: Oh, for flair.

03:26:49.972 --> 03:26:51.849
MATT: Going to make it fun, because you said green.

03:26:51.849 --> 03:26:53.862
I'll let it be green, [inaudible] smaller.

03:26:53.862 --> 03:26:55.225
MARISHA: Eat it, eat it.

03:26:55.225 --> 03:26:56.739
TRAVIS: Or maybe it'll be pink.

03:26:56.739 --> 03:26:58.207
MATT: Maybe we'll pretend it's green.

03:26:58.207 --> 03:27:00.677
(laughter)

03:27:00.677 --> 03:27:03.589
It's D&amp;D, use your imagination.

03:27:03.589 --> 03:27:06.131
SAM: I think it'll have to [inaudible].

03:27:06.131 --> 03:27:08.832
MATT: Sorry, I broke immersion, guys, fuck.

03:27:08.832 --> 03:27:09.665
TRAVIS: That's it.

03:27:09.665 --> 03:27:12.356
MATT: So you watch as Fjord spins around,

03:27:12.356 --> 03:27:13.489
as he arcs his hand,

03:27:13.489 --> 03:27:16.700
all of a sudden there's this spray of weirdly

03:27:16.700 --> 03:27:19.403
glowing green globules that suddenly burst

03:27:19.403 --> 03:27:21.275
and adhere to the outside of this creature,

03:27:21.275 --> 03:27:22.703
and as it does they all light up around it,

03:27:22.703 --> 03:27:25.510
like this starscape of bright green energy

03:27:25.510 --> 03:27:27.648
that's clinging to its body.

03:27:27.648 --> 03:27:29.239
That finishes your turn?
TRAVIS: Yep.

03:27:29.239 --> 03:27:31.860
MATT: All righty, it's now its turn.

03:27:31.860 --> 03:27:35.178
At this point, as the magic sprays on it

03:27:35.178 --> 03:27:36.314
and it took the impact from behind,

03:27:36.314 --> 03:27:39.451
it seems nonplussed, but not distracted by it.

03:27:39.451 --> 03:27:41.898
Its jaw now begins to open wide

03:27:41.898 --> 03:27:43.268
in the three different places.

03:27:43.268 --> 03:27:46.698
Now you can see the toothy-lined interior of its open mouth

03:27:46.698 --> 03:27:49.522
and just, (shrieking)

03:27:49.522 --> 03:27:52.304
and the trill pierces the air around it.

03:27:52.304 --> 03:27:55.014
All of you, moreso when it arrived,

03:27:55.014 --> 03:27:58.865
you feel the scream just beat onto your eardrums

03:27:58.865 --> 03:27:59.698
and into your mind.

03:27:59.698 --> 03:28:01.585
I need everybody to make a wisdom saving throw, please.

03:28:01.585 --> 03:28:03.995
LIAM: No! Don't like that

03:28:03.995 --> 03:28:05.085
SAM: But we have advantage.

03:28:05.085 --> 03:28:07.835
LAURA: We all get advantage on it because we--

03:28:07.835 --> 03:28:10.210
SAM: Heroes' Feast?
LAURA: Yeah, we totally are awesome.

03:28:10.210 --> 03:28:11.742
ASHLEY: No advantage, we just are rolling.

03:28:11.742 --> 03:28:14.548
LIAM: Oh no.
LAURA: Oh, what's that, natural 20!

03:28:14.548 --> 03:28:17.339
MATT: Nice.
MARISHA: Oh, there's a lot of groans.

03:28:17.339 --> 03:28:18.439
TRAVIS: (groans)
TALIESIN: Oh no.

03:28:18.439 --> 03:28:19.401
MARISHA: Lot of groans.

03:28:19.401 --> 03:28:20.386
SAM: I'm going to fall 40 feet.

03:28:20.386 --> 03:28:21.219
TRAVIS: 13.

03:28:21.219 --> 03:28:22.770
MATT: 13, okay.

03:28:22.770 --> 03:28:25.420
LAURA: Natural 20 for a 30.
MATT: 30, great. Caleb?

03:28:25.420 --> 03:28:26.798
LIAM: 13.
MATT: 13.

03:28:26.798 --> 03:28:28.988
SAM: 14.
MATT: 14.

03:28:28.988 --> 03:28:30.506
ASHLEY: Eight.
MATT: Eight.

03:28:30.506 --> 03:28:31.664
TALIESIN: 13.
MATT: 13.

03:28:31.664 --> 03:28:34.458
MARISHA: 15.
LAURA: Oh no.

03:28:34.458 --> 03:28:36.154
What about Dagen?

03:28:36.154 --> 03:28:37.607
What did you-- you also rolled 15?

03:28:37.607 --> 03:28:38.728
TRAVIS: 13.

03:28:38.728 --> 03:28:40.160
LAURA: Everybody rolled low?

03:28:40.160 --> 03:28:41.432
MARISHA: Except for you.

03:28:41.432 --> 03:28:42.265
LAURA: Oh no.

03:28:42.265 --> 03:28:43.939
(laughter)

03:28:43.939 --> 03:28:45.498
TRAVIS: There's another 18 over here somewhere.

03:28:45.498 --> 03:28:47.502
MATT: Dagen failed as well.

03:28:47.502 --> 03:28:49.073
LAURA: Everybody failed?!

03:28:49.073 --> 03:28:52.271
MATT: Everybody failed except for you.

03:28:52.271 --> 03:28:56.006
MARISHA and SAM: Oh no.
(screaming)

03:28:56.006 --> 03:28:58.266
MARISHA: What does it mean?!
TALIESIN: Whatever high level spells you have,

03:28:58.266 --> 03:29:00.319
you better bust them out.

03:29:00.319 --> 03:29:02.307
MARISHA: If we have our brains.
SAM: Is it paralysis?

03:29:02.307 --> 03:29:03.864
Is it fright? What is it?

03:29:03.864 --> 03:29:06.422
MARISHA: Does he possess us?
Are we worm people now?

03:29:06.422 --> 03:29:09.211
TRAVIS: We're going to find out, oh no.

03:29:09.211 --> 03:29:13.180
MATT: You are all stunned for one minute.

03:29:13.180 --> 03:29:14.994
TRAVIS: One minute?!

03:29:14.994 --> 03:29:17.865
SAM: Oh no, you got to have some restoration or something.

03:29:17.865 --> 03:29:19.982
MARISHA: Oh no.

03:29:19.982 --> 03:29:22.466
SAM: Does that mean I fall out of the sky, Matthew?

03:29:22.466 --> 03:29:23.299
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: It does.

03:29:23.299 --> 03:29:25.994
All spells that are being concentrated on drop.

03:29:25.994 --> 03:29:27.927
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Fuck!

03:29:27.927 --> 03:29:29.996
MATT: So Yasha reverts.

03:29:29.996 --> 03:29:32.478
LIAM: You shrunk my barbarian.

03:29:32.478 --> 03:29:35.027
TRAVIS: Oh boy.
MARISHA: We lost that Faerie Fire?

03:29:35.027 --> 03:29:36.852
MATT: You plummet and take--

03:29:36.852 --> 03:29:38.578
MARISHA: Wait, is Faerie Fire concentration?

03:29:38.578 --> 03:29:39.765
TALIESIN: No.

03:29:39.765 --> 03:29:40.598
TRAVIS: It is.
MATT: It is, I believe.

03:29:40.598 --> 03:29:42.021
MARISHA: Oh, fuck.
ASHLEY: I just saw it, too,

03:29:42.021 --> 03:29:43.937
and I got out the d4.
MATT: You take 10 points of bludgeoning damage

03:29:43.937 --> 03:29:47.698
as you fall into the ground.
SAM: Not bad, actually.

03:29:47.698 --> 03:29:50.123
TALIESIN: Do you have anything?

03:29:51.146 --> 03:29:52.090
LAURA: I have a plan.

03:29:52.090 --> 03:29:53.956
MATT: And the Faerie Fire fades.
TALIESIN: You have a plan?

03:29:53.956 --> 03:29:55.827
SAM: Is it "Run"?

03:29:55.827 --> 03:29:57.320
LAURA: I'm just going to leave you guys and run away.

03:29:57.320 --> 03:29:58.663
LIAM: Byeeee!
LAURA: That's my plan.

03:29:58.663 --> 03:29:59.738
ASHLEY: Going to Aeor.

03:29:59.738 --> 03:30:02.877
LAURA: I'll slowly revive you guys over the next few days!

03:30:02.877 --> 03:30:05.252
Bye!
LIAM: (like Jester) I'm a Tomb Taker now.

03:30:06.965 --> 03:30:08.307
MARISHA: Lucien, wait up!

03:30:08.307 --> 03:30:10.032
LAURA: Essek, um!
MARISHA: Lucien!

03:30:10.987 --> 03:30:12.416
TALIESIN: Fuck, man.

03:30:12.416 --> 03:30:14.421
MATT: All of you just fall to the ground,

03:30:14.421 --> 03:30:17.573
clutching your head and you can't see it.

03:30:17.573 --> 03:30:21.392
It's just white, white hot, knife vision in your mind

03:30:21.392 --> 03:30:22.600
You can't even form thought.

03:30:22.600 --> 03:30:25.066
You are just frozen in place as your body is

03:30:25.066 --> 03:30:28.487
just hearing this high pitched screaming whine,

03:30:28.487 --> 03:30:30.935
and all thought and reaction is brought

03:30:30.935 --> 03:30:33.033
to a dull nothingness.

03:30:33.033 --> 03:30:33.866
TRAVIS: This is a good lesson.

03:30:33.866 --> 03:30:35.258
We really need protection against this.

03:30:35.258 --> 03:30:36.995
LIAM: I don't think there's ever been a moment

03:30:36.995 --> 03:30:39.416
in this show where the group has all but one

03:30:39.416 --> 03:30:40.705
has been whammied like that.

03:30:40.705 --> 03:30:42.475
MATT: Yeah, usually it's the other way,

03:30:42.475 --> 03:30:44.182
so I'm super happy right now.

03:30:44.182 --> 03:30:47.410
(laughter)

03:30:47.410 --> 03:30:49.447
Yasha, I need you to make constitution saving throw.

03:30:49.447 --> 03:30:53.268
LIAM: That's amazing.
ASHLEY: Okay, which one do I choose?

03:30:53.268 --> 03:30:55.262
I'll do this one.

03:30:55.262 --> 03:30:58.112
Oh, that was good, that was good.

03:30:58.112 --> 03:31:00.970
That would be a total of

03:31:00.970 --> 03:31:03.036
26.

03:31:03.934 --> 03:31:07.084
MATT: Yasha, as you shrink down clutching your head,

03:31:07.084 --> 03:31:08.634
you look up at the creature

03:31:08.634 --> 03:31:11.380
and not even realizing your friends around you,

03:31:11.380 --> 03:31:16.172
that pain sucked and was really uncalled for.

03:31:16.172 --> 03:31:19.080
And in the fury and anger within, you shrug off the effect

03:31:19.080 --> 03:31:19.913
and your eyes go bloodshot.

03:31:19.913 --> 03:31:21.760
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's go.
MATT: You are no longer stunned.

03:31:21.760 --> 03:31:23.280
It is your turn, it is your turn.

03:31:23.280 --> 03:31:25.505
ASHLEY: It's my turn?
MARISHA: Is that some barbarian shit?

03:31:25.505 --> 03:31:26.540
MATT: No, she just rolled really high.

03:31:26.540 --> 03:31:27.848
MARISHA: You just rolled high?
MATT: Yeah.

03:31:27.848 --> 03:31:29.509
ASHLEY: It my turn?
MATT: That's the end of your turn.

03:31:29.509 --> 03:31:30.417
ASHLEY: That's the end of my turn.

03:31:30.417 --> 03:31:32.092
Oh, because that's because we were stunned,

03:31:32.092 --> 03:31:33.086
and we all got shit.

03:31:33.086 --> 03:31:34.723
MARISHA: So we can shrug it off.
SAM: Oh, so we get a save

03:31:34.723 --> 03:31:36.492
every time it comes up.
MATT: Caduceus, it's your turn.

03:31:36.492 --> 03:31:38.297
MARISHA: I guess so, yeah.

03:31:38.297 --> 03:31:39.872
MATT: Go ahead and roll a constitution saving throw.

03:31:39.872 --> 03:31:41.099
TALIESIN: This is not going to go well.

03:31:41.099 --> 03:31:42.482
LIAM: Shrank my damn barbarian.

03:31:42.482 --> 03:31:43.832
TALIESIN: Not feeling it.

03:31:43.832 --> 03:31:45.244
SAM: Wasted spells.

03:31:45.244 --> 03:31:47.383
MARISHA: Goddamn it.
TRAVIS: ♪ GIF of the week! ♪

03:31:47.383 --> 03:31:50.686
TALIESIN: Constitution?
I don't suppose 11 is great.

03:31:50.686 --> 03:31:53.434
MATT: You are still lost in the haze.

03:31:53.434 --> 03:31:55.911
SAM: 11 is just what you need.

03:31:55.911 --> 03:31:57.076
MATT: Jester, it's your turn.

03:31:57.076 --> 03:31:59.925
LAURA: Oh shit, I'm going to look around.

03:31:59.925 --> 03:32:02.415
I'm going to run forward

03:32:02.415 --> 03:32:03.994
to the other side.
MATT: Also this drops.

03:32:03.994 --> 03:32:06.487
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, the other one's not gone,

03:32:06.487 --> 03:32:07.709
but that one is.
MATT: No, Jester keeps hers.

03:32:07.709 --> 03:32:10.892
LAURA: I'm going to run around
Dagen and get closer to the worm,

03:32:10.892 --> 03:32:13.391
LAURA: I'm going to run around
Dagen and get closer to the worm,

03:32:13.391 --> 03:32:16.438
so it's within my range of Spirit Guardians,

03:32:16.438 --> 03:32:18.391
but I want to stay at a distance, you know what I mean?

03:32:18.391 --> 03:32:19.518
MATT: How far away, like in front of Dagen?

03:32:19.518 --> 03:32:22.269
LAURA: Like, I need to be within 15 feet of it, but--

03:32:22.269 --> 03:32:23.102
LIAM: But that's it.

03:32:23.102 --> 03:32:24.922
LAURA: Yeah, I don't want to get closer than that.

03:32:24.922 --> 03:32:26.474
MATT: Correct, it's within your range there.

03:32:26.474 --> 03:32:28.201
LAURA: Okay, and then--

03:32:28.201 --> 03:32:29.845
TRAVIS: This is snow is awesome.

03:32:29.845 --> 03:32:30.678
ASHLEY: It's so cool.

03:32:30.678 --> 03:32:32.710
TRAVIS: The base of it, so rad.

03:32:32.710 --> 03:32:33.627
LAURA: And then--

03:32:35.356 --> 03:32:36.456
TALIESIN: Plan?

03:32:38.942 --> 03:32:39.792
LAURA: Yeah.

03:32:40.649 --> 03:32:44.575
I'm going to cast Polymorph on it.

03:32:44.575 --> 03:32:45.408
MATT: On it?

03:32:45.408 --> 03:32:46.466
MARISHA and LAURA: Yes.
MATT: Okay.

03:32:46.466 --> 03:32:47.299
MARISHA: Do it.

03:32:47.299 --> 03:32:50.558
LAURA: I'm going to try to turn it into

03:32:50.558 --> 03:32:55.558
something that can handle the cold weather.

03:32:56.169 --> 03:32:58.325
A snow bunny.

03:32:58.325 --> 03:33:00.075
MATT: A snow bunny, okay.

03:33:01.021 --> 03:33:02.883
What's the save on that. Is it wisdom?

03:33:02.883 --> 03:33:06.460
LAURA: Wisdom.
MATT: Wisdom, on a DC of?

03:33:06.460 --> 03:33:08.043
LAURA: 18.
MATT: 18.

03:33:10.303 --> 03:33:11.455
That's a fail.

03:33:11.455 --> 03:33:12.755
(sharp inhalations)

03:33:12.755 --> 03:33:14.083
MARISHA: Thank god.

03:33:14.083 --> 03:33:17.283
TRAVIS: Dude, dude.
MARISHA: Oh, thank god.

03:33:18.505 --> 03:33:19.338
SAM: Epic.

03:33:21.794 --> 03:33:24.103
TALIESIN: Make sure it's not in your fucking range.

03:33:24.103 --> 03:33:27.418
LAURA: Well, I can, the range is within my control.

03:33:27.418 --> 03:33:29.132
I get to say if it's a threat or not, so.

03:33:29.132 --> 03:33:30.034
MATT: We'll say that is a bunny.

03:33:30.034 --> 03:33:31.351
(laughter)

03:33:31.351 --> 03:33:33.993
MARISHA: Oh, buddy.
ASHLEY: Oh, it's a doggo!

03:33:35.465 --> 03:33:36.749
That looks like Henry.

03:33:36.749 --> 03:33:39.404
LAURA: And the guardians are not going to attack it,

03:33:39.404 --> 03:33:42.780
because it's not a threat.

03:33:43.888 --> 03:33:46.479
They attack only the things that I want them to attack.

03:33:46.479 --> 03:33:48.789
TALIESIN: That's true, you can designate.

03:33:48.789 --> 03:33:51.331
MATT: Just double checking that for my own.

03:33:51.331 --> 03:33:52.164
SAM: Sure, sure.

03:33:52.164 --> 03:33:56.017
TALIESIN: Now I'm rereading it. Now you made me paranoid.

03:33:56.017 --> 03:33:58.081
MATT: "When you cast the spell, you can designate it."

03:33:58.081 --> 03:33:59.710
LAURA: Then I'm going to back up,

03:33:59.710 --> 03:34:01.460
because it's at the start of their turn.

03:34:01.460 --> 03:34:04.177
MATT: That's true, okay, so you back up.

03:34:05.941 --> 03:34:10.357
So you moved here, one, two, three,

03:34:10.357 --> 03:34:13.199
five, six, I imagine.

03:34:13.199 --> 03:34:14.032
LIAM: Success.

03:34:15.202 --> 03:34:16.410
SAM: Sucks ass?

03:34:16.410 --> 03:34:18.035
LAURA: Sucks ass.

03:34:19.451 --> 03:34:21.759
MATT: All right, that finishes your turn?

03:34:23.416 --> 03:34:24.457
LAURA: And I'm going to go:

03:34:24.457 --> 03:34:29.365
Wake up, everyone! Wake up! It's a bunny!

03:34:30.591 --> 03:34:31.424
MATT: They don't notice anything.

03:34:31.424 --> 03:34:32.781
You guys have no idea what's happening.

03:34:32.781 --> 03:34:34.310
LAURA: Does it cancel the stunned affect?

03:34:34.310 --> 03:34:35.366
It doesn't cancel it if it--
MATT: No.

03:34:35.366 --> 03:34:36.199
LAURA: Oh god, okay.

03:34:36.199 --> 03:34:38.524
MATT: It's not like a spell it cast on you.

03:34:38.524 --> 03:34:42.657
TRAVIS: If that dog, bunny,
runs into that ring we're fucked.

03:34:42.657 --> 03:34:44.118
TALIESIN: Yeah, if the bunny runs
into the circle we're fucked.

03:34:44.118 --> 03:34:45.446
TRAVIS: You bought us a round at least.

03:34:45.446 --> 03:34:46.756
LAURA: Well, you know, I can, I mean,

03:34:46.756 --> 03:34:48.519
I can drop my Spirit Guardians.

03:34:48.519 --> 03:34:49.506
So maybe I'll just drop it.

03:34:49.506 --> 03:34:50.689
TRAVIS: On your turn, right?

03:34:50.689 --> 03:34:54.585
LAURA: But I mean, it's easy to just drop a spell.

03:34:54.585 --> 03:34:55.434
MATT: If you want to.
TALIESIN: You just hit yourself

03:34:55.434 --> 03:34:56.459
in the head hard enough.

03:34:56.459 --> 03:34:58.411
LAURA: I'm going to drop the spell, just in case.

03:34:58.411 --> 03:35:00.914
I don't want the bunny to fucking run into my--

03:35:00.914 --> 03:35:02.378
MARISHA: Look, it's a bunny. (expanding)

03:35:02.378 --> 03:35:04.704
(screaming)
MARISHA: Shit!

03:35:04.704 --> 03:35:08.104
MATT: Okay, all right.

03:35:08.104 --> 03:35:09.021
Beauregard.

03:35:10.522 --> 03:35:13.763
MARISHA: I'm going to save, right? It's all about that save.

03:35:13.763 --> 03:35:14.747
LIAM: Wisdom.

03:35:14.747 --> 03:35:15.734
TALIESIN: How long does Polymorph last?

03:35:15.734 --> 03:35:16.567
LAURA: An hour.

03:35:18.570 --> 03:35:19.820
MARISHA: Natural one.

03:35:21.372 --> 03:35:22.438
MATT: You remain stunned.

03:35:22.438 --> 03:35:24.786
It is not magic.
LAURA: It's only magic.

03:35:24.786 --> 03:35:28.523
MATT: Yeah, all right, that finishes your turn.

03:35:28.523 --> 03:35:30.218
Veth, I need you to make a constitution saving throw

03:35:30.218 --> 03:35:31.385
for me, please.

03:35:32.689 --> 03:35:34.288
SAM: 10.

03:35:34.288 --> 03:35:36.879
MATT: It's a ten? Okay, you remain stunned.

03:35:36.879 --> 03:35:39.593
Caleb, I need you to make a constitution saving throw.

03:35:39.593 --> 03:35:41.995
LIAM: Wisdom save, that is--
MATT: Constitution.

03:35:41.995 --> 03:35:44.094
LIAM: Constitution, that is a 19.

03:35:44.094 --> 03:35:46.072
MATT: 19, you fail.

03:35:46.072 --> 03:35:49.792
TRAVIS: Wow, fuck, oh no.

03:35:49.792 --> 03:35:52.095
MARISHA: Thank god we don't have to deal with this thing.

03:35:52.095 --> 03:35:52.928
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

03:35:52.928 --> 03:35:54.174
MATT: All right, so that brings us to Fjord.

03:35:54.174 --> 03:35:55.403
I need you to make a constitution saving throw.

03:35:55.403 --> 03:35:57.469
MARISHA: What do you have to do? Roll a 20?
TRAVIS: Nope.

03:35:57.469 --> 03:35:59.719
MATT: Okay, you remain stunned.
LIAM: Unless it tries to kill itself in shame.

03:36:02.005 --> 03:36:03.172
(high-pitched) I can't live like this. (poofing)

03:36:03.172 --> 03:36:04.621
MATT: If I could have...

03:36:07.430 --> 03:36:10.347
have Beau-- or no, you're actually.

03:36:14.357 --> 03:36:15.190
Huh.

03:36:18.278 --> 03:36:22.299
If I could have Yasha, and Caduceus, Jester, and Fjord

03:36:22.299 --> 03:36:23.715
all roll a d20 for me.

03:36:28.446 --> 03:36:30.113
TALIESIN: Nope.
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

03:36:31.270 --> 03:36:32.931
What, what it's right here!

03:36:32.931 --> 03:36:35.801
MATT: Whoever rolled the highest was going to be the target.

03:36:35.801 --> 03:36:36.634
SAM: Yes!

03:36:37.602 --> 03:36:40.269
ASHLEY: Definitely wasn't going to be me.

03:36:41.767 --> 03:36:44.064
TRAVIS: I feel like that's in some way appropriate.

03:36:44.064 --> 03:36:47.226
LAURA: It's still going to attack
as a bunny. It's going to attack?

03:36:47.226 --> 03:36:51.144
MATT: Of course, it doesn't--
LIAM: It's got terrible teeth!

03:36:51.144 --> 03:36:54.104
TRAVIS: It's so Holy Grail.
MARISHA: It's so Monty Python.

03:36:54.104 --> 03:36:56.140
MATT: It is not intelligent enough to acknowledge

03:36:56.140 --> 03:36:57.352
that it's a bunny right now.

03:36:57.352 --> 03:36:59.340
It's just wondering why everything is so much bigger

03:36:59.340 --> 03:37:02.330
and it's confused and it's still going with its instincts.

03:37:02.330 --> 03:37:03.431
MARISHA: You take that attack.

03:37:03.431 --> 03:37:06.273
TRAVIS: Should've made it
a baby seal, so they're (seal barking).

03:37:06.273 --> 03:37:07.574
MATT: It does have advantage on the attack,

03:37:07.574 --> 03:37:09.299
because you're stunned.

03:37:10.385 --> 03:37:12.644
That is a 17.

03:37:12.644 --> 03:37:13.721
TRAVIS: To hit?!
MATT: Yeah.

03:37:13.721 --> 03:37:15.029
TRAVIS: That's my AC.

03:37:15.029 --> 03:37:17.398
(laughter)

03:37:17.398 --> 03:37:20.902
TALIESIN: This is everything I wanted, right here.

03:37:20.902 --> 03:37:24.152
MATT: You take a point of piercing damage

03:37:24.152 --> 03:37:26.071
as it bites on you.

03:37:26.071 --> 03:37:28.580
TRAVIS: I'm never living that down.
MARISHA: First the snapping turtle,

03:37:28.580 --> 03:37:29.915
and now the bunny.
LIAM: This is a sequel

03:37:29.915 --> 03:37:32.377
to the snapping turtle.
MATT: That's right.

03:37:32.377 --> 03:37:35.735
It jumps through the snow. (hopping)

03:37:35.735 --> 03:37:39.217
TRAVIS: Fjord, to you want to go
to the Arbuckle Wilderness? (screaming) No!

03:37:39.217 --> 03:37:41.585
LAURA: Arbuckle Wilderness.

03:37:41.585 --> 03:37:43.534
MATT: That's hilarious.

03:37:43.534 --> 03:37:45.503
All right.
TRAVIS: In the 80s.

03:37:45.503 --> 03:37:46.470
Is that still around?
MATT: Wait.

03:37:46.747 --> 03:37:48.447
You have Star Razor up, don't you?

03:37:48.447 --> 03:37:49.422
TRAVIS: I do.

03:37:49.422 --> 03:37:50.255
Oh!

03:37:51.717 --> 03:37:53.102
MARISHA: (screams) No!

03:37:53.102 --> 03:37:55.153
LAURA: Does it automatically fight back?

03:37:55.153 --> 03:37:56.407
TRAVIS: Yeah, it does.

03:37:56.407 --> 03:37:58.082
SAM: Oh no.

03:37:58.082 --> 03:38:01.312
TRAVIS: It does. He takes--
SAM: He blasts back.

03:38:01.312 --> 03:38:03.016
SAM: Like 25 points of damage.

03:38:03.016 --> 03:38:03.957
MATT: It's not 25.

03:38:03.957 --> 03:38:06.352
TRAVIS: 1d12 radiant damage.

03:38:06.352 --> 03:38:08.150
LIAM: That rabbit's got two hit points at best.

03:38:08.150 --> 03:38:10.399
ASHLEY: Oh no, you don't...
MARISHA: Oh, it's a worm again.

03:38:10.399 --> 03:38:12.739
ASHLEY: You don't roll to hit?

03:38:12.739 --> 03:38:14.147
TRAVIS: Where's my d12?
ASHLEY: It just does it automatically?

03:38:14.147 --> 03:38:17.197
MARISHA: Of all people for the bunny to go after.

03:38:17.197 --> 03:38:18.130
LIAM: That's amazing.

03:38:19.507 --> 03:38:21.354
TRAVIS: One, I rolled a one.
LIAM: Well, I want to fight a worm.

03:38:21.354 --> 03:38:23.178
MATT: I know. It has <i>a</i> hit point.

03:38:23.178 --> 03:38:26.009
(groaning and screaming)
MATT: It's a snow bunny!

03:38:26.009 --> 03:38:26.842
MARISHA: Hit point of a kitten.

03:38:26.842 --> 03:38:28.892
SAM: Oh no!

03:38:28.892 --> 03:38:33.892
MATT: (crashing sound)
(cheering and laughter)

03:38:33.987 --> 03:38:36.612
LIAM: Meat's back on the menu, boys!

03:38:37.547 --> 03:38:39.388
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah!

03:38:39.388 --> 03:38:42.599
MARISHA: Oh no!
SAM: So now you've killed a bunny paralyzed.

03:38:42.599 --> 03:38:43.457
(laughter)

03:38:43.457 --> 03:38:46.189
MATT: Yasha, you are up and it's your turn.

03:38:46.189 --> 03:38:49.127
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm coming out of the--

03:38:49.127 --> 03:38:51.648
MATT: Looking at Fjord going, "No, no, no, no!"

03:38:51.648 --> 03:38:53.376
(explosion) (screaming)

03:38:53.376 --> 03:38:54.903
(laughter)

03:38:54.903 --> 03:38:58.292
MARISHA: Not me, not me! Shoo! Shoo!

03:38:58.292 --> 03:39:01.726
TRAVIS: Do I roll to s-- does it break the charm at all?

03:39:01.726 --> 03:39:03.337
MATT: No, it's not like that.

03:39:04.515 --> 03:39:07.637
LIAM: It bit your foot and your foot went (explosion).

03:39:07.637 --> 03:39:08.647
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

03:39:08.647 --> 03:39:12.277
Okay, so as I'm coming to, I'm getting so angry

03:39:12.277 --> 03:39:17.277
and now the worm is gone from my area

03:39:17.337 --> 03:39:20.558
so I will make my way over to--

03:39:20.558 --> 03:39:21.766
SAM, MARISHA, and ASHLEY: ♪ Making my way! ♪

03:39:21.766 --> 03:39:23.778
ASHLEY: ♪ Making my way to the worm. ♪

03:39:24.917 --> 03:39:27.422
Okay?
MATT: There? Anywhere else you want to be placed?

03:39:27.422 --> 03:39:28.938
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So flanking.

03:39:28.938 --> 03:39:30.731
Oh no. That doesn't work because it's--
MATT: There?

03:39:30.731 --> 03:39:31.847
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:39:31.847 --> 03:39:33.197
MATT: He's not really threatening you at the moment,

03:39:33.197 --> 03:39:34.207
so you don't get any flanking bonus.

03:39:34.207 --> 03:39:35.867
ASHLEY: No, no, that's fine. Okay, so.

03:39:35.867 --> 03:39:38.273
MATT: But you can attack recklessly
if you want to, for the advantage.

03:39:38.273 --> 03:39:41.336
ASHLEY: Yes, I would like rage.
LAURA: You were so proud of it, too

03:39:41.336 --> 03:39:42.169
ASHLEY: And--

03:39:43.929 --> 03:39:45.829
That's right, I never use reckless,

03:39:45.829 --> 03:39:47.177
I always forget about that.

03:39:47.177 --> 03:39:50.747
Okay, so raging and attacking.

03:39:50.747 --> 03:39:52.440
MATT: Raging and attacking, go for it.

03:39:52.440 --> 03:39:53.380
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:39:53.380 --> 03:39:54.785
LIAM: D&amp;D is so weird.

03:39:54.785 --> 03:39:56.938
Yasha went
(growing and shrinking noises)

03:39:56.938 --> 03:39:58.458
and the worm went
(shrinking and growing noises).

03:39:58.458 --> 03:39:59.291
ASHLEY: 18?

03:39:59.291 --> 03:40:01.191
MATT: It totally did!
(laughter)

03:40:01.191 --> 03:40:03.774
MARISHA: Yeah, within, like, six seconds.
LAURA: (yelling)

03:40:07.197 --> 03:40:08.627
LIAM: In six seconds or less.

03:40:08.627 --> 03:40:09.460
MATT: Yeah.

03:40:09.460 --> 03:40:12.901
If Lucien's group is watching from a distance,

03:40:12.901 --> 03:40:14.249
they're like, "What the fuck is happening?"

03:40:14.249 --> 03:40:17.630
TRAVIS: Dagen's just going like,
"I don't want to remember this either."

03:40:17.630 --> 03:40:18.676
(laughter)

03:40:18.676 --> 03:40:20.726
LIAM: "Take my memory away again."

03:40:20.726 --> 03:40:21.842
MATT: So Yasha?

03:40:21.842 --> 03:40:23.657
ASHLEY: Does that hit? 18?

03:40:23.657 --> 03:40:25.367
MATT: 18 does hit.

03:40:25.367 --> 03:40:26.880
ASHLEY: Okay, so,

03:40:29.701 --> 03:40:31.057
that's pretty good.

03:40:31.057 --> 03:40:35.307
Okay, that would be, hmm,

03:40:35.307 --> 03:40:37.817
29 points of damage for the first hit.

03:40:37.817 --> 03:40:38.957
MATT: Nice!

03:40:38.957 --> 03:40:40.360
ASHLEY: Let's see.

03:40:41.401 --> 03:40:42.547
TRAVIS: (laughs)

03:40:42.547 --> 03:40:45.717
Second hit.
LAURA: Real proud of that!

03:40:45.717 --> 03:40:48.327
ASHLEY: That would be-- That's a natural 18, so...

03:40:48.327 --> 03:40:49.504
MATT: Yeah, it definitely hits.

03:40:49.504 --> 03:40:50.770
TRAVIS: Put your sword away!

03:40:53.303 --> 03:40:54.511
TALIESIN: Yeah, this is bad.

03:40:54.511 --> 03:40:56.097
ASHLEY: Ooh, I'm going to reroll that.

03:40:57.687 --> 03:40:59.127
That's so much better.

03:40:59.127 --> 03:41:02.567
Okay, 18 points of damage for the second hit.

03:41:02.567 --> 03:41:04.847
MATT: Nice, and you actually take 18 points of cold damage

03:41:04.847 --> 03:41:06.867
from your two melee strikes against it.

03:41:06.867 --> 03:41:08.437
As you strike across it with the blade,

03:41:08.437 --> 03:41:10.967
once again, that weird cold aura seems to be pulsing

03:41:10.967 --> 03:41:12.627
from between the armor plates and it hits you

03:41:12.627 --> 03:41:14.807
and you feel your limbs go numb temporarily

03:41:14.807 --> 03:41:16.297
and you have to shake them off as you back away

03:41:16.297 --> 03:41:18.130
from the attack.
ASHLEY: Augh!

03:41:18.130 --> 03:41:21.564
MATT: Its essence seems to be
freezing on the inside as well.

03:41:21.564 --> 03:41:23.254
So that finishes your go, Yasha.

03:41:23.254 --> 03:41:25.658
Caduceus, constitution taking throw.

03:41:25.658 --> 03:41:27.487
SAM: Come on, Caduceus.

03:41:27.487 --> 03:41:28.320
MARISHA: Big money.

03:41:29.267 --> 03:41:30.647
TALIESIN: 14.
MARISHA: Fuck!

03:41:30.647 --> 03:41:32.277
MATT: No, sorry.

03:41:32.277 --> 03:41:34.270
Jester, it's your turn.

03:41:35.351 --> 03:41:36.764
LAURA: Polymorph!

03:41:36.764 --> 03:41:38.088
SAM: Oh my god!
TALIESIN: Thank you!

03:41:38.088 --> 03:41:39.405
TRAVIS: Let's go.
SAM: I love it.

03:41:42.940 --> 03:41:44.822
MATT: (shrinking sound)

03:41:44.822 --> 03:41:47.395
LAURA: But I'm not going to make it a bunny this time.

03:41:47.395 --> 03:41:49.817
MATT: What are you making it?

03:41:49.817 --> 03:41:51.624
LAURA: A turtle.

03:41:51.624 --> 03:41:52.972
TRAVIS: Give it some hit points, if you want.

03:41:52.972 --> 03:41:55.667
LAURA: Oh, right, because it's going to attack probably you,

03:41:55.667 --> 03:41:57.467
huh, again?

03:41:57.467 --> 03:41:59.522
TRAVIS: Make it a polar bear.
LAURA: No!

03:41:59.522 --> 03:42:01.181
MATT: What are you choosing?

03:42:01.181 --> 03:42:02.657
LAURA: (stammers)

03:42:02.657 --> 03:42:05.047
MATT: Going with turtle or something else?

03:42:05.047 --> 03:42:07.804
LAURA: Oh, not a walrus, it's going to hurt.

03:42:07.804 --> 03:42:08.637
TRAVIS: It's up to you.

03:42:08.637 --> 03:42:10.068
LIAM: Less than a giant worm.

03:42:10.068 --> 03:42:11.030
LAURA: A seal.

03:42:11.957 --> 03:42:12.827
MATT: I-- 'kay.

03:42:12.827 --> 03:42:14.277
SAM: Come on, where's your seal?

03:42:14.277 --> 03:42:16.418
MATT: I bought a package of turtles.

03:42:16.418 --> 03:42:17.756
LAURA: A turtle!

03:42:17.756 --> 03:42:19.094
MATT: So your seal--

03:42:19.094 --> 03:42:22.594
LAURA: I said a turtle!
TRAVIS: Not a snapping turtle.

03:42:22.594 --> 03:42:23.937
LAURA: No, it's a regular turtle.

03:42:23.937 --> 03:42:27.050
I said turtle originally. He tried to talk me out of it.

03:42:27.050 --> 03:42:28.603
TRAVIS: It likes Florida, it doesn't like this!

03:42:28.603 --> 03:42:30.913
MATT: If you want it to be a seal,
it'll just look like a turtle.

03:42:30.913 --> 03:42:32.825
LAURA: I want it to be a turtle, Matt!

03:42:32.825 --> 03:42:35.143
MARISHA: Snapping turtle!
TRAVIS: Not a snapping turtle!

03:42:35.143 --> 03:42:36.395
LAURA: It's not a snapping turtle.

03:42:36.395 --> 03:42:39.341
It's a nice, friendly, Galapagos Island,

03:42:39.341 --> 03:42:40.890
old turtle.
MATT: Tortoise.

03:42:40.890 --> 03:42:42.190
LAURA: A tortoise.

03:42:42.190 --> 03:42:43.737
MATT: All right, you've got it.

03:42:43.737 --> 03:42:47.817
LIAM: No seal, huh? What a failure.
TRAVIS: (laser buzzing)

03:42:47.817 --> 03:42:49.117
MATT: All right.

03:42:49.117 --> 03:42:51.687
LAURA: He looks like a tortoise.

03:42:51.687 --> 03:42:52.520
MATT: That is Jester's turn.

03:42:52.520 --> 03:42:54.467
LIAM: Oh, I love him.
TRAVIS: Why is he pointing at me?

03:42:54.467 --> 03:42:55.300
MARISHA: He knows.

03:42:55.300 --> 03:42:57.267
LIAM: Is that, like, a kid's toy turtle?

03:42:57.267 --> 03:42:59.375
LAURA: He's so cute.
LIAM: He is cute.

03:42:59.375 --> 03:43:02.017
MARISHA: Matt got, like, a bucket
of animals not too long ago.

03:43:02.017 --> 03:43:04.891
TRAVIS: (laughs) Sent to the house?
MATT: Yep.

03:43:04.891 --> 03:43:06.697
I'm like, they're Polymorphing into weird shit now,

03:43:06.697 --> 03:43:09.870
I'm just going to have a collection at the ready now.

03:43:09.870 --> 03:43:11.403
TALIESIN: Is the armor still up, by the way,

03:43:11.403 --> 03:43:13.961
is the armor still going to do damage?
SAM: This should be a game,

03:43:13.961 --> 03:43:16.237
like we should just try to stump Matt.
MATT: No! No.

03:43:16.237 --> 03:43:18.077
SAM: He's a platypus now, you got that one?

03:43:18.077 --> 03:43:20.786
TALIESIN: We should get in front of the fucking-- ah!

03:43:20.786 --> 03:43:21.897
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah.

03:43:21.897 --> 03:43:24.567
LIAM: I turn into an emu.

03:43:24.567 --> 03:43:26.686
TRAVIS: Somebody grapple that fucking turtle.

03:43:26.686 --> 03:43:28.712
MATT: Back to Amazon.

03:43:28.712 --> 03:43:32.477
I'm trying to order, like, way too many kids' toy packages.

03:43:32.477 --> 03:43:36.187
All right, that finishes Jester's go.

03:43:36.187 --> 03:43:38.887
Beau and Veth, roll constitution saving throws, please.

03:43:40.917 --> 03:43:42.628
MARISHA: Nope.
SAM: 14.

03:43:42.628 --> 03:43:44.937
MATT: Nope, both still stunned.
MARISHA: I rolled a four.

03:43:44.937 --> 03:43:45.770
SAM: Nice.

03:43:45.770 --> 03:43:48.147
TRAVIS: You guys, holy shit.

03:43:48.147 --> 03:43:49.107
LIAM: Wow.

03:43:49.107 --> 03:43:50.298
MATT: Caleb?
LIAM: Yeah.

03:43:51.490 --> 03:43:53.543
LIAM: Um, it's con?

03:43:54.627 --> 03:43:56.693
MATT: Constitution.
LIAM: Same as before-- oh wait.

03:43:59.891 --> 03:44:02.117
On con saves-- oh, I should have broken free last time.

03:44:02.117 --> 03:44:03.197
That's fine, I'll do it this time,

03:44:03.197 --> 03:44:05.147
because I get to add my proficiency

03:44:05.147 --> 03:44:06.657
because of my transmuter stone.

03:44:06.657 --> 03:44:09.399
So 19 plus five, 24.

03:44:09.399 --> 03:44:11.829
MATT: You don't have the
transmuter's stone as anything else?

03:44:11.829 --> 03:44:13.217
You have it just for the constitution bonus?

03:44:13.217 --> 03:44:15.237
LIAM: Just for the con, that's
how I always have it set to that.

03:44:15.237 --> 03:44:16.517
MATT: All righty, so then now you break free.

03:44:16.517 --> 03:44:17.987
LIAM: It was my brain fart last turn.

03:44:17.987 --> 03:44:20.010
I'll just let that go, but I'm back.
MATT: Got it, all right.

03:44:20.010 --> 03:44:21.123
You are no longer stunned.

03:44:21.123 --> 03:44:23.733
SAM: Woohoo! We got two casters up.

03:44:23.733 --> 03:44:28.037
MARISHA: DM, just to clarify, this is not included

03:44:28.037 --> 03:44:31.737
under a frightened or charmed ability, is it?

03:44:31.737 --> 03:44:32.570
MATT: Correct.

03:44:34.057 --> 03:44:34.890
Correct.

03:44:36.377 --> 03:44:37.622
MARISHA: You sure?

03:44:37.622 --> 03:44:39.327
TRAVIS: (imitating Marisha) Are you sure?

03:44:39.327 --> 03:44:41.437
MATT: It doesn't cause the frightened effect,

03:44:41.437 --> 03:44:42.477
doesn't cause the charmed effect.

03:44:42.477 --> 03:44:44.280
It literally just stuns you.
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay.

03:44:44.280 --> 03:44:46.387
TALIESIN: In an irritating electric net.

03:44:46.387 --> 03:44:48.025
TRAVIS: It's a monk, it's a monk worm.

03:44:48.025 --> 03:44:49.694
MATT: I can show you the sheet.

03:44:49.694 --> 03:44:51.659
SAM: Prove it.
TRAVIS: We believe you.

03:44:51.659 --> 03:44:53.737
MATT: Read The Explorer's Guide To Wildemount,

03:44:53.737 --> 03:44:54.814
that'll be the proof you need.

03:44:54.814 --> 03:44:57.057
SAM: No, I can't read that, there's spoilers in there.

03:44:57.057 --> 03:44:59.453
MATT: I told you what pages you can't
read, you can read the rest of it.

03:44:59.453 --> 03:45:02.170
SAM: I got to read the whole thing.
MATT: Fair enough, okay. Regardless.

03:45:02.170 --> 03:45:03.807
Caleb, you are now coming back to consciousness.

03:45:03.807 --> 03:45:05.827
All of a sudden you push out of the pain.

03:45:05.827 --> 03:45:07.306
You're up against the rock again.

03:45:07.306 --> 03:45:09.914
And you look around for the creature
and it's nowhere to be seen.

03:45:11.367 --> 03:45:12.837
LIAM: I can't do anything though, right?

03:45:12.837 --> 03:45:13.857
MATT: No, that's the end of your turn.

03:45:13.857 --> 03:45:16.291
But just, it's gone.

03:45:16.291 --> 03:45:18.349
It's fucking gone.
TRAVIS: But you see this-- (turtle noise)

03:45:18.349 --> 03:45:19.698
LIAM: Okay, there's Jester.

03:45:19.698 --> 03:45:21.846
MATT: No, he doesn't see anything.
That turtle's sunk in the snow.

03:45:21.846 --> 03:45:23.763
TRAVIS: (turtle noises)
(laughter)

03:45:23.763 --> 03:45:25.294
MATT: All right.

03:45:25.294 --> 03:45:29.097
That brings us to Fjord, constitution.

03:45:29.097 --> 03:45:29.930
TRAVIS: Nope.

03:45:29.930 --> 03:45:30.763
MATT: Okay.

03:45:33.627 --> 03:45:35.643
LAURA: No, no!

03:45:35.643 --> 03:45:38.222
Doesn't he want to roll again?

03:45:38.222 --> 03:45:39.927
MATT: Hmm?
LAURA: Doesn't he want to roll again?

03:45:39.927 --> 03:45:43.607
Isn't he stupid? To find out who he's attacking?

03:45:43.607 --> 03:45:44.997
MATT: This is what he was facing before.

03:45:44.997 --> 03:45:45.830
TALIESIN: It hurt, though.

03:45:45.830 --> 03:45:47.963
MATT: Sure, sure. Let's roll again. Why not?

03:45:47.963 --> 03:45:48.796
TALIESIN: I'm into it.

03:45:48.796 --> 03:45:52.441
TRAVIS: But I'm making-- (turtle sound) sounds.

03:45:53.291 --> 03:45:55.285
MARISHA: He hears the mating call.

03:45:55.285 --> 03:45:57.670
TRAVIS: (turtle noise)
MATT: Roll a d20 for me.

03:45:57.670 --> 03:45:59.330
TRAVIS: (turtle noise)

03:45:59.330 --> 03:46:00.350
LAURA: Four.

03:46:00.350 --> 03:46:02.116
MATT: Yeah, it's attacking Fjord.

03:46:02.116 --> 03:46:04.557
(laughter)

03:46:04.557 --> 03:46:05.937
If you rolled above a 10,

03:46:05.937 --> 03:46:08.637
I was going to say we'll go ahead
and have it attack somebody else.

03:46:08.637 --> 03:46:11.906
LAURA: Okay, hopefully it'll
have more hit points, a tortoise.

03:46:12.756 --> 03:46:14.907
How many hit points does a tortoise have?

03:46:14.907 --> 03:46:16.610
MATT: There is no specific...

03:46:24.067 --> 03:46:27.757
There is no bestiary input for turtle.

03:46:27.757 --> 03:46:30.657
So I'm just going to give it a standard plus three to hit.

03:46:32.647 --> 03:46:33.757
15?

03:46:33.757 --> 03:46:35.209
TRAVIS: Misses.

03:46:35.209 --> 03:46:38.257
(cheering)
TRAVIS: Hey, that's great!

03:46:38.257 --> 03:46:40.597
MARISHA: You dodged a turtle, good for you.

03:46:40.597 --> 03:46:42.373
TALIESIN: May we all dodge a turtle.

03:46:43.390 --> 03:46:45.614
MATT: It just, like, bit at your heel,

03:46:45.614 --> 03:46:48.167
but it couldn't get through the armor and you're like--

03:46:48.167 --> 03:46:50.316
All right, that finishes its turn.

03:46:50.316 --> 03:46:51.907
Yasha you're up. Caduceus. you're on deck.

03:46:51.907 --> 03:46:56.296
ASHLEY: Okay, what I will do now is--

03:46:58.829 --> 03:47:00.177
TRAVIS: Cut its head off.

03:47:00.177 --> 03:47:02.307
ASHLEY: Oh, shoot I forgot to do "rest."

03:47:02.307 --> 03:47:05.687
TALIESIN: Don't even fuck around, not funny.

03:47:05.687 --> 03:47:07.137
ASHLEY: Okay, so I would like to...

03:47:08.798 --> 03:47:11.687
sorry, this is on the fritz a little bit.

03:47:11.687 --> 03:47:12.520
Here we go.

03:47:12.520 --> 03:47:14.807
Okay, so I'm going to do a-- what is it called?

03:47:14.807 --> 03:47:18.200
Zealous Presence as a bonus action, battle cry.

03:47:19.277 --> 03:47:21.177
All of the creatures of my choice,

03:47:21.177 --> 03:47:24.178
not all of them, 10 of them, but that's enough,

03:47:25.970 --> 03:47:28.596
advantage on attack rolls and saving throws.

03:47:28.596 --> 03:47:31.376
TALIESIN: Hey, money money.
TRAVIS: Clutch!

03:47:31.376 --> 03:47:36.075
ASHLEY: And then I just--

03:47:37.007 --> 03:47:38.523
What are we doing, Jester?

03:47:38.523 --> 03:47:39.907
LAURA: Just don't hit him!

03:47:39.907 --> 03:47:42.292
ASHLEY: Should I pick him up and move him?

03:47:42.292 --> 03:47:43.522
LAURA: Flip him over!

03:47:43.522 --> 03:47:45.857
ASHLEY: Yeah, okay, so I'm going to go over

03:47:45.857 --> 03:47:49.950
and try to pick him up and put him on his back.

03:47:50.927 --> 03:47:55.027
MATT: Okay, so you move over.

03:47:55.027 --> 03:47:56.247
Make an athletics check.

03:47:56.247 --> 03:47:58.830
TALIESIN: You see a turtle in the
snow storm, it's lying on his back.

03:47:58.830 --> 03:48:01.121
You don't help it, why?

03:48:03.969 --> 03:48:05.367
ASHLEY: 22.

03:48:05.367 --> 03:48:07.257
MATT: You beat its six.

03:48:08.337 --> 03:48:10.427
Yeah, as part of your shove attack,

03:48:10.427 --> 03:48:14.027
you turn it onto his back in the snow and it's now--

03:48:14.027 --> 03:48:16.737
ASHLEY: Okay, and I'm going to
turn his head away from Fjord.

03:48:16.737 --> 03:48:19.032
I'm going to try to turn him on his shell.

03:48:19.032 --> 03:48:21.406
(laughter)

03:48:21.406 --> 03:48:22.727
MATT: There you go.

03:48:22.727 --> 03:48:24.467
ASHLEY: And then I'm going to give--

03:48:24.467 --> 03:48:26.607
I'm going to give him some scratches on his belly

03:48:26.607 --> 03:48:29.057
and just be like, what are we-- what are we doing?

03:48:29.897 --> 03:48:32.547
LAURA: I think we just let him sit there for a little bit.

03:48:34.959 --> 03:48:36.907
TRAVIS: I think the belly is a shell, right?

03:48:36.907 --> 03:48:38.474
ASHLEY: No.
MATT: Yeah.

03:48:38.474 --> 03:48:39.337
LAURA: He can feel it.
ASHLEY: It is?

03:48:39.337 --> 03:48:42.453
MATT: Yeah, it's a shell, but it has sensitivity.

03:48:42.453 --> 03:48:44.653
MARISHA: I don't know turtle life.

03:48:44.653 --> 03:48:45.993
MATT: Does that finish your turn, Yasha?

03:48:45.993 --> 03:48:47.887
ASHLEY: I just thought it was the top-- I'm done.

03:48:47.887 --> 03:48:50.430
MATT: Caduceus, make a constitution
saving throw with advantage.

03:48:52.700 --> 03:48:54.397
TALIESIN: 17?
MATT: Nope.

03:48:54.397 --> 03:48:56.037
TALIESIN: Jesus.
MATT: Sorry.

03:48:56.037 --> 03:48:57.537
LAURA: I would like to picture a turtle, though,

03:48:57.537 --> 03:48:59.437
with no shell on the bottom, just like--

03:49:00.880 --> 03:49:02.877
MATT: It would be Dagen, but he can't make his save.

03:49:02.877 --> 03:49:05.219
He keeps showing super low on his saving throw.

03:49:05.219 --> 03:49:06.905
TALIESIN: Even with advantage?
MATT: He has a decent bonus.

03:49:06.905 --> 03:49:08.971
Even with the advantage, he rolled a four and a five.

03:49:10.204 --> 03:49:11.545
Next is Jester.

03:49:13.587 --> 03:49:18.570
LAURA: I will go over and cast...

03:49:19.627 --> 03:49:21.443
that seems like--

03:49:23.293 --> 03:49:24.609
I'm just going to go over

03:49:24.609 --> 03:49:29.609
and help Yasha pet his belly until everybody wakes up.

03:49:29.767 --> 03:49:31.992
MATT: You've got it. There's now a dual turtle petting squad

03:49:31.992 --> 03:49:33.487
here in the middle of the snow.

03:49:33.487 --> 03:49:35.887
LAURA: Maybe it'll calm him down.

03:49:35.887 --> 03:49:37.720
Calm down.

03:49:38.580 --> 03:49:40.797
MATT: Roll animal handling.
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah.

03:49:42.498 --> 03:49:44.640
LAURA: Ooh, okay, okay, okay!

03:49:44.640 --> 03:49:46.106
TALIESIN: I have-- no, no.

03:49:48.467 --> 03:49:50.540
LAURA: Can I guidance myself?
MATT: Sure.

03:49:50.540 --> 03:49:52.106
Actually guidance is an action, so no.

03:49:52.106 --> 03:49:54.681
LAURA: Oh, okay, well, that's not going to work.

03:49:56.364 --> 03:49:57.206
10.

03:49:57.206 --> 03:49:58.039
MATT: 10.

03:49:59.289 --> 03:50:01.817
You don't think it's calming.

03:50:01.817 --> 03:50:02.650
LAURA: Okay.

03:50:02.650 --> 03:50:04.738
MATT: All right, that finishes Jester's go.

03:50:04.738 --> 03:50:05.797
That brings us to the top.

03:50:05.797 --> 03:50:08.302
Beau, Veth, make a constitution throw with advantage.

03:50:08.302 --> 03:50:09.602
MARISHA: With advantage, why?

03:50:09.602 --> 03:50:10.853
MATT: Because of Yasha's yell.

03:50:10.853 --> 03:50:11.717
MARISHA: (gasps)

03:50:11.717 --> 03:50:14.329
You did the thing?
ASHLEY: I did the thing.

03:50:14.329 --> 03:50:15.846
MARISHA: Oh my gosh, yes, yes!

03:50:15.846 --> 03:50:17.807
(excited noises)

03:50:17.807 --> 03:50:18.640
22!

03:50:18.640 --> 03:50:20.522
MARISHA: That's succeeds, you're free.

03:50:20.522 --> 03:50:23.285
ASHLEY: Yes!
MARISHA: I rolled a five and a 19.

03:50:23.285 --> 03:50:24.751
MATT: There you go, Beauregard.

03:50:24.751 --> 03:50:28.276
At the end of your turn, you are no longer stunned.

03:50:28.276 --> 03:50:29.617
All right.
SAM: Bit by bit.

03:50:30.720 --> 03:50:34.297
ASHLEY: You also are correct,
shells are just a part of their body.

03:50:34.297 --> 03:50:36.157
I trust you are correct.

03:50:36.157 --> 03:50:38.133
LIAM: Plus they like the pizza.

03:50:38.133 --> 03:50:39.207
SAM: That's true, they do.

03:50:39.207 --> 03:50:41.700
TALIESIN: They had an awkward adolescence as well.
MATT: This is important to know.

03:50:41.700 --> 03:50:43.427
MATT: All righty, Caleb.

03:50:43.427 --> 03:50:45.887
LIAM: I crush a bit of catmint in my hands

03:50:45.887 --> 03:50:48.467
and a spectral Frumpkin appears for a second.

03:50:48.467 --> 03:50:50.867
Then giant cat claw's there.

03:50:50.867 --> 03:50:53.807
And I will use it to fly through the air

03:50:53.807 --> 03:50:55.707
over towards the snow, beyond the turtle

03:50:55.707 --> 03:50:59.187
and drag a bunch of snow up and sort of cement it

03:50:59.187 --> 03:51:01.407
into position with snow.

03:51:01.407 --> 03:51:04.177
MATT: Okay, so you are covering the turtle with snow.

03:51:04.177 --> 03:51:05.564
LAURA: But don't-- make sure it can still breathe!

03:51:05.564 --> 03:51:06.807
MATT: Are you're traveling with the claw?

03:51:06.807 --> 03:51:08.927
LIAM: No, I'm just getting, I'm just cementing

03:51:08.927 --> 03:51:11.547
and I'm creating a little tidal wave

03:51:11.547 --> 03:51:13.327
of snow over his body to hold him place.

03:51:13.327 --> 03:51:15.458
TRAVIS: Little snow bank.

03:51:15.458 --> 03:51:18.913
LIAM: So he can't do any roly poly stuff to flip over.

03:51:18.913 --> 03:51:19.746
MATT: Fair enough.

03:51:19.746 --> 03:51:23.002
TRAVIS: Tune into Critical Role
for hard-hitting turtle violence.

03:51:23.002 --> 03:51:27.380
(laughter)

03:51:27.380 --> 03:51:30.763
SAM: Soft-hitting.
(laughter continues)

03:51:30.763 --> 03:51:31.826
TRAVIS: What are you guys fighting?

03:51:31.826 --> 03:51:34.687
MATT: It's now covered.
LAURA: Aww!

03:51:34.687 --> 03:51:37.859
SAM: We're burying turtles in snow.
LIAM: Ooh, that's a beauty, that one!

03:51:37.859 --> 03:51:40.064
TRAVIS: Do you have Epsom salt?
Just pour it on there.

03:51:40.064 --> 03:51:41.347
MATT: I have to get it from the back room.

03:51:41.347 --> 03:51:45.967
SAM: Oh man, I saw the sickest shit
on Critical Role last night.

03:51:45.967 --> 03:51:47.867
ASHLEY: Dude, drop the handle of whoever made it.

03:51:47.867 --> 03:51:50.380
LIAM: Caleb is such a killer.

03:51:51.339 --> 03:51:52.477
MATT: Is that your turn?

03:51:52.477 --> 03:51:54.785
The cat's claw remains out here.

03:51:54.785 --> 03:51:55.901
MARISHA: Oh, because you're stunned.

03:51:55.901 --> 03:51:58.651
LIAM: Aw, there he is, little cat claw.

03:51:58.651 --> 03:52:00.887
MATT: All right, that finishes your go, Caleb.

03:52:00.887 --> 03:52:03.177
Fjord, make a constitution save with advantage.

03:52:03.177 --> 03:52:04.010
TRAVIS: Oh!

03:52:05.435 --> 03:52:07.352
Nope.
MARISHA: No? What?

03:52:07.352 --> 03:52:08.985
No!
TRAVIS: Nope.

03:52:10.327 --> 03:52:12.377
MATT: All right.
TRAVIS: What, no!

03:52:12.377 --> 03:52:16.284
MATT: The turtle is going to attempt to get out of the snow,

03:52:16.284 --> 03:52:18.725
with its athletics check.

03:52:18.725 --> 03:52:20.366
Oh! Oh, it actually rolled pretty--

03:52:20.366 --> 03:52:21.599
LAURA: It got out of the snow?

03:52:21.599 --> 03:52:23.887
MATT: It got out of the snow.

03:52:23.887 --> 03:52:26.755
But the snow is still rough terrain for it.

03:52:26.755 --> 03:52:28.279
Not that it has to move.

03:52:28.279 --> 03:52:31.477
(laughter)

03:52:31.477 --> 03:52:33.220
TRAVIS: Persistent fucking turtle.

03:52:33.220 --> 03:52:35.423
LIAM: Fucking turtle worm.

03:52:35.423 --> 03:52:38.040
MARISHA: The snow is rough terrain.
TRAVIS: (turtle noise)

03:52:38.040 --> 03:52:40.473
MATT: I would like Jester, Fjord, and Yasha
to roll a d20 for me.

03:52:40.473 --> 03:52:43.656
MATT: I would like Jester, Fjord, and Yasha
to roll a d20 for me.

03:52:43.656 --> 03:52:44.531
ASHLEY: Okay.
LAURA: Okay.

03:52:44.531 --> 03:52:47.857
MATT: Since it was turned around to see how it goes after.

03:52:47.857 --> 03:52:50.239
TRAVIS: Two.
LAURA: Six.

03:52:50.239 --> 03:52:51.559
ASHLEY: I rolled a one.

03:52:51.559 --> 03:52:53.259
LAURA: (gasps) Me!

03:52:53.259 --> 03:52:54.928
MATT: It goes after Jester.

03:52:54.928 --> 03:52:57.804
LAURA: Oh, but I was rubbing your belly! I like you!

03:52:57.804 --> 03:52:59.954
LIAM: (turtle chomping)

03:53:01.177 --> 03:53:03.387
MATT: That is going to be a 14 to hit.

03:53:03.387 --> 03:53:04.730
LAURA: I pull my ankle back.

03:53:06.338 --> 03:53:07.171
MATT: Yep!

03:53:08.308 --> 03:53:09.862
SAM: Expertly dodged.

03:53:09.862 --> 03:53:12.612
(laughter)

03:53:14.201 --> 03:53:15.401
MATT: Yasha, it's your turn.

03:53:15.401 --> 03:53:16.245
LIAM: No, don't do it.

03:53:16.245 --> 03:53:20.887
ASHLEY: Okay, so I would like to now, at this point--
MATT: Riveting.

03:53:20.887 --> 03:53:22.995
(laughter)

03:53:22.995 --> 03:53:26.675
TRAVIS: This is the real show.
MATT: You got on the board for five minutes, buddy.

03:53:26.675 --> 03:53:27.875
TRAVIS: This is the real shit.
TALIESIN: Beautiful.

03:53:29.427 --> 03:53:31.480
ASHLEY: I'm going to pick up the turtle.

03:53:33.208 --> 03:53:37.531
And just walk it as far away--
LAURA: Oh, walk it down to the ice!

03:53:37.531 --> 03:53:40.057
ASHLEY: Oh yeah, I'll put him out on the ice.

03:53:40.057 --> 03:53:42.827
Just as far as I can walk.

03:53:42.827 --> 03:53:44.068
MATT: You pick up the turtle.

03:53:44.068 --> 03:53:45.480
TALIESIN: Hmm.

03:53:45.480 --> 03:53:46.764
LAURA: You think he'll fall through?
MARISHA: He'll be fine.

03:53:46.764 --> 03:53:49.058
TALIESIN: I assume everything is going to be terrible.

03:53:49.058 --> 03:53:50.514
TRAVIS: It's really cold out here.
ASHLEY: I know, I'm really nervous.

03:53:50.514 --> 03:53:51.563
TRAVIS: It's so fucking cold.

03:53:51.563 --> 03:53:53.596
MATT: Are you just dropping him onto the ice

03:53:53.596 --> 03:53:56.297
or you staying at the edge and sliding him?

03:53:56.297 --> 03:53:58.991
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, shuffleboard him.

03:53:58.991 --> 03:54:03.187
ASHLEY: Very gently, I'm going to lay him on the back.

03:54:03.187 --> 03:54:07.857
So he's a little slippery and then just push him away.

03:54:07.857 --> 03:54:10.247
MATT: Sure, so I'll consider it a grapple attack

03:54:10.247 --> 03:54:11.887
for the first one.

03:54:11.887 --> 03:54:13.205
Go ahead and make an athletics check for me,

03:54:13.205 --> 03:54:15.383
just to make sure you can grapple it.
SAM: You have a broom?

03:54:15.383 --> 03:54:18.102
MARISHA: Yeah, we're curling the turtle.

03:54:18.102 --> 03:54:21.072
LIAM: Yasha invented hockey. Canon.
MATT: Curtling.

03:54:23.597 --> 03:54:24.430
ASHLEY: 17.

03:54:24.430 --> 03:54:26.367
MATT: Yeah, you pick him up and move him over there

03:54:26.367 --> 03:54:29.694
and then you let him loose and he slides a little bit.

03:54:29.694 --> 03:54:34.344
(laughter)

03:54:35.179 --> 03:54:36.407
SAM: Saddest combat.

03:54:36.407 --> 03:54:37.957
ASHLEY: Okay, do we--

03:54:37.957 --> 03:54:40.137
MARISHA: This fight is ridiculous.
ASHLEY: Let me see if there's anything else I can do.

03:54:41.144 --> 03:54:41.977
TRAVIS: Let's spin him.

03:54:41.977 --> 03:54:43.457
We don't know which way he's facing.

03:54:43.457 --> 03:54:46.067
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll really just give him a good--

03:54:46.067 --> 03:54:49.540
MATT: Yeah, he's like-- I can't do that here.

03:54:49.540 --> 03:54:51.857
(laughter)

03:54:51.857 --> 03:54:53.615
MATT: That's as far as it can go.
(cheering)

03:54:53.615 --> 03:54:55.290
MATT: But imagine it's still going.

03:54:55.290 --> 03:54:57.937
LAURA: It really looks like, Matt, it looks like it's ice,

03:54:57.937 --> 03:54:59.272
so it's really fucking with us.

03:54:59.272 --> 03:55:00.530
MATT: Imagination.

03:55:03.317 --> 03:55:05.557
All right, Caduceus, make your saving throw

03:55:05.557 --> 03:55:07.297
not advantage because that is faded.

03:55:07.297 --> 03:55:09.714
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck.
ASHLEY: Come on.

03:55:11.037 --> 03:55:11.957
TALIESIN: 20.

03:55:11.957 --> 03:55:13.113
MATT: That'll do.

03:55:13.113 --> 03:55:14.567
(cheering)

03:55:14.567 --> 03:55:16.687
MATT: You are no longer stunned.

03:55:16.687 --> 03:55:18.617
MARISHA: Oh my goodness.

03:55:18.617 --> 03:55:20.757
MATT: That finishes your turn.
MARISHA: Wait, has Dagen been rolling?

03:55:20.757 --> 03:55:22.123
MATT: He has been, he's next.

03:55:22.123 --> 03:55:22.956
MARISHA: Okay.

03:55:23.957 --> 03:55:25.690
MATT: There we go, that does it.

03:55:25.690 --> 03:55:27.449
He breaks free of the stun as well.

03:55:29.927 --> 03:55:33.650
Angrily shakes it off in his chair.

03:55:35.347 --> 03:55:37.717
"All right, where the fuck is it?"

03:55:37.717 --> 03:55:40.907
ASHLEY: He's out on the ice. He's a turtle now.

03:55:40.907 --> 03:55:43.627
TALIESIN: Not for super long,
either, so we should probably--

03:55:43.627 --> 03:55:45.927
MATT: He looks really confused, goes, "Sure."

03:55:46.987 --> 03:55:48.340
That brings us to Jester.

03:55:50.932 --> 03:55:52.917
TALIESIN: Bless?

03:55:52.917 --> 03:55:53.997
LAURA: Do I have Bless?

03:55:53.997 --> 03:55:55.637
TALIESIN: I don't know, do you?

03:55:55.637 --> 03:55:57.220
LAURA: No.
TALIESIN: Oh, never mind.

03:56:02.077 --> 03:56:05.120
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to just go--

03:56:06.787 --> 03:56:09.007
I'm not going to waste a spell right now, hopefully.

03:56:09.007 --> 03:56:11.717
I'm just going to go out to the edge of the ice

03:56:11.717 --> 03:56:15.090
with Yasha and watch the turtle spin.

03:56:16.350 --> 03:56:17.300
SAM: Is that a metaphor?

03:56:19.317 --> 03:56:20.797
MATT: All stand there at the edge,

03:56:20.797 --> 03:56:22.367
looking at this poor little turtle,

03:56:22.367 --> 03:56:25.583
just doing slow 360s.

03:56:25.583 --> 03:56:27.116
TRAVIS: Yasha, you watching the turtle?

03:56:27.116 --> 03:56:30.787
ASHLEY: That's like one of those weird Scandinavian things,

03:56:30.787 --> 03:56:33.480
like you've planted too many potatoes.

03:56:35.755 --> 03:56:38.018
MATT: You spun too many turtles.

03:56:38.018 --> 03:56:42.118
All right, that finishes Jester's go. Beau and Veth.

03:56:42.118 --> 03:56:44.084
SAM: Oh, you're already free.
MARISHA: I'm good.

03:56:44.084 --> 03:56:44.917
MATT: Without advantage.

03:56:44.917 --> 03:56:45.750
SAM: Oh, without advantage?

03:56:45.750 --> 03:56:48.147
I will roll again.
MATT: Yeah, that's passed off.

03:56:48.147 --> 03:56:49.067
SAM: 13.

03:56:49.067 --> 03:56:49.986
MATT: No, you're still stunned.

03:56:49.986 --> 03:56:53.507
MARISHA: I walk over to the edge of the ice

03:56:53.507 --> 03:56:55.077
and join the other ladies

03:56:55.077 --> 03:56:57.650
in watching the turtle spin, I guess.

03:56:58.927 --> 03:57:00.377
I'll go on the far side of Caleb.

03:57:00.377 --> 03:57:03.316
The other side of Caleb, go that way, yeah.

03:57:03.316 --> 03:57:04.220
MATT: Get you about there.

03:57:05.367 --> 03:57:06.200
MARISHA: 'Sup?

03:57:08.564 --> 03:57:11.315
LAURA: We're just-- in case he turns back, we're prepared.

03:57:11.315 --> 03:57:12.857
MARISHA: It's a good idea.

03:57:12.857 --> 03:57:14.159
MATT: You got it, all right.

03:57:14.159 --> 03:57:16.617
That finishes their go. Caleb, whatcha doing?

03:57:16.617 --> 03:57:17.927
LIAM: Veth, you already did your--?

03:57:17.927 --> 03:57:19.335
SAM: I'm paralyzed still.

03:57:19.335 --> 03:57:21.397
LIAM: I just get a little more of that iron powder,

03:57:21.397 --> 03:57:24.497
but I crunch it down and try to shrink the turtle

03:57:24.497 --> 03:57:27.950
to tiny size, so that's a wisdom save.

03:57:27.950 --> 03:57:30.043
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: As a turtle.

03:57:30.043 --> 03:57:31.622
MARISHA: That won't hurt the turtle?

03:57:31.622 --> 03:57:34.177
LAURA: Oh, just so he won't fall
through the ice, that's good.

03:57:34.177 --> 03:57:35.377
MATT: It rolled a 17.

03:57:35.377 --> 03:57:36.367
LIAM: Failed.

03:57:36.367 --> 03:57:39.945
MATT: Well, and it's minus three, so definitely failed.

03:57:39.945 --> 03:57:41.902
I don't have a smaller turtle.

03:57:41.902 --> 03:57:43.182
TRAVIS: Matt?

03:57:43.182 --> 03:57:45.888
(laughter)

03:57:45.888 --> 03:57:48.336
SAM: You know--
MATT: Yeah?

03:57:48.336 --> 03:57:50.610
TRAVIS: Yeah?
MATT: Hey, Travis.

03:57:50.610 --> 03:57:52.802
LIAM: Do you have, like, a BB or--?

03:57:56.277 --> 03:57:58.081
SAM: Hey Matt, you know how when you're spinning--

03:57:58.081 --> 03:57:58.914
LIAM: The head of a mini?

03:57:58.914 --> 03:57:59.914
SAM: You know how when you're spinning

03:57:59.914 --> 03:58:02.014
and you bring your arms in and you go faster?

03:58:02.014 --> 03:58:03.827
Because the turtle's smaller,

03:58:03.827 --> 03:58:06.603
does it start to spin faster?
MATT: Oh yeah, it's spinning a lot quicker now.

03:58:06.603 --> 03:58:09.285
(whirring)

03:58:09.285 --> 03:58:12.277
Remember the tiny orb of death in the first campaign?

03:58:12.277 --> 03:58:13.886
It's like that, but with legs.

03:58:13.886 --> 03:58:16.411
(laughter)

03:58:16.411 --> 03:58:18.667
TRAVIS: (screams)

03:58:18.667 --> 03:58:19.917
MATT: I'm trying to--

03:58:19.917 --> 03:58:21.032
LIAM: It's only like this for a minute.

03:58:21.032 --> 03:58:22.773
TRAVIS: I love that you're searching for a smaller--

03:58:22.773 --> 03:58:23.673
MATT: Here.

03:58:23.673 --> 03:58:24.689
LIAM: Turtle for an hour,

03:58:24.689 --> 03:58:26.914
tiny turtle for a minute.
MATT: This piece of glitter

03:58:27.799 --> 03:58:28.649
is the turtle.

03:58:28.649 --> 03:58:32.657
(laughter)

03:58:32.657 --> 03:58:35.282
TRAVIS: That fucking shot is amazing!
MARISHA: Yeah!

03:58:35.282 --> 03:58:37.941
(laughter)

03:58:37.941 --> 03:58:39.716
MARISHA: Zoom in on that glitter.

03:58:39.716 --> 03:58:41.804
MATT: Epic confrontations, the high level rounds

03:58:41.804 --> 03:58:42.890
of Dungeons &amp; Dragons!
MARISHA: Yeah, there we go. Zoom in on

03:58:42.890 --> 03:58:47.018
that glitter with those PTZs. Yeah, yeah!

03:58:47.018 --> 03:58:49.127
SAM: Level 13 D&amp;D.

03:58:49.127 --> 03:58:51.210
MATT: Yeah, all right.

03:58:51.210 --> 03:58:55.837
So Fjord, go ahead and roll, man.

03:58:55.837 --> 03:58:56.670
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah.

03:58:56.670 --> 03:58:58.617
TALIESIN: Oh, wait, do I have a--

03:58:58.617 --> 03:58:59.987
MATT: That was Caleb's turn.

03:58:59.987 --> 03:59:02.017
TRAVIS: Hey, 24!

03:59:02.017 --> 03:59:04.600
(cheering)

03:59:05.757 --> 03:59:06.590
MATT: All righty.

03:59:06.590 --> 03:59:09.092
MARISHA: How far into the minute are we?
SAM: You guy could probably just pick me up and leave.

03:59:09.092 --> 03:59:11.117
MATT: We're six rounds into it now.
LAURA: I don't think you have to roll after Yasha.

03:59:11.117 --> 03:59:12.713
MARISHA: Six rounds in, okay.
LAURA: You probably should roll again,

03:59:12.713 --> 03:59:13.546
shouldn't you?

03:59:13.546 --> 03:59:14.897
TALIESIN: No, I'm fine, I just--

03:59:14.897 --> 03:59:16.022
MATT: It'll come back to his in a moment.

03:59:16.022 --> 03:59:16.855
LAURA: Okay.

03:59:18.467 --> 03:59:21.935
All right, so now it's the turtle's turn.

03:59:24.947 --> 03:59:26.367
Yeah, it gets up.

03:59:28.287 --> 03:59:29.403
TRAVIS: (laughs) Turn over the glitter.

03:59:29.403 --> 03:59:32.271
LIAM: Thank you for adjusting it for us.

03:59:32.271 --> 03:59:34.783
MARISHA: (laughs) He just flipped the glitter.

03:59:34.783 --> 03:59:37.582
MATT: I want Jester, Yasha, Caleb, and Beau

03:59:37.582 --> 03:59:39.356
to roll a d20, please.

03:59:39.356 --> 03:59:41.297
TRAVIS: I actually lost sight of it a little bit.

03:59:41.297 --> 03:59:42.130
MATT: It's on my hand.

03:59:42.130 --> 03:59:43.813
TRAVIS: Oh. (laughs)

03:59:43.813 --> 03:59:45.045
MARISHA: Oh shit.

03:59:45.045 --> 03:59:46.212
LAURA: Nine!

03:59:46.212 --> 03:59:47.685
MARISHA: Natural 20.

03:59:47.685 --> 03:59:51.021
SAM: Oh boy, Beau, he's going for you.
LAURA: Coming for you, Beau.

03:59:51.021 --> 03:59:52.800
LIAM: Better get that Patient Defense going.

03:59:52.800 --> 03:59:55.840
MARISHA: Oh boy. It's stuck to your finger.

03:59:57.817 --> 04:00:01.837
MATT: Oh wow! 20?

04:00:01.837 --> 04:00:03.455
MARISHA: Miss.

04:00:03.455 --> 04:00:04.646
TRAVIS: Trying to picture it.

04:00:07.157 --> 04:00:08.677
LIAM: Just put her foot back two inches.

04:00:08.677 --> 04:00:10.627
MARISHA: Yeah, I just pick it up.

04:00:10.627 --> 04:00:12.632
TRAVIS: We probably could just grab Veth.

04:00:12.632 --> 04:00:14.740
MATT: You're just hold it with your toe.
LAURA: Yeah, at this point.

04:00:14.740 --> 04:00:17.148
MATT: It can't quite get to you.
LAURA: Also you were also stunned, though..

04:00:17.148 --> 04:00:17.981
TRAVIS: Right, thank you.

04:00:17.981 --> 04:00:20.487
MATT: That brings us to Yasha.

04:00:20.487 --> 04:00:22.220
ASHLEY: It's already my turn, okay.

04:00:23.167 --> 04:00:25.747
What do I do, should we just go?
LAURA: Can we just pick up Veth

04:00:25.747 --> 04:00:27.004
and we'll just keep walking?
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:00:27.004 --> 04:00:27.927
LIAM: Jog on out of here?

04:00:27.927 --> 04:00:30.795
ASHLEY: I'm going to grab Veth.

04:00:30.795 --> 04:00:32.478
MARISHA: It's Polymorphed for an hour, right?

04:00:32.478 --> 04:00:33.461
LIAM and ASHLEY: Yeah.

04:00:33.461 --> 04:00:34.752
ASHLEY: Fireman's carry Veth,

04:00:34.752 --> 04:00:37.092
and then we'll start walking.

04:00:37.092 --> 04:00:38.066
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: Lets do it.

04:00:38.066 --> 04:00:40.172
MATT: For the sake of brevity--

04:00:40.172 --> 04:00:41.547
SAM: No, we want to play it out.

04:00:41.547 --> 04:00:45.857
MATT: This incredibly dangerous encounter--

04:00:47.077 --> 04:00:47.910
TRAVIS: Baby turtle.

04:00:49.017 --> 04:00:51.187
MATT: -- has ended in the climactic finish

04:00:52.447 --> 04:00:55.347
of you carrying your stunned halfling friend

04:00:57.557 --> 04:01:00.917
as Dagen goes, "All right, I don't know

04:01:00.917 --> 04:01:02.592
"what the fuck you people are,

04:01:02.592 --> 04:01:06.417
"but thanks. Let's go."

04:01:06.417 --> 04:01:11.100
As you all leave the slowly walking,

04:01:11.100 --> 04:01:13.200
angry turtle, it's slipping on ice.

04:01:14.777 --> 04:01:16.830
LAURA: You'll turn back, he'll be okay.

04:01:16.830 --> 04:01:19.277
LIAM: (squeaky voice) That's right, you better run!

04:01:19.277 --> 04:01:21.827
TALIESIN: We have made an enemy for life.

04:01:21.827 --> 04:01:23.959
TRAVIS: A dragon turtle and a purple worm.
LAURA: We make a lot of enemies.

04:01:23.959 --> 04:01:25.677
MATT: This has certainly been added with ferocity

04:01:25.677 --> 04:01:27.567
to the encounter list now because it has a

04:01:27.567 --> 04:01:28.564
double reason to hunt you,

04:01:28.564 --> 04:01:30.186
but we'll see what you guys roll in the future.

04:01:30.186 --> 04:01:31.618
LAURA: Oh no.
TALIESIN: Oh no.

04:01:31.618 --> 04:01:33.661
MARISHA: "Added with ferocity."
TRAVIS: As long as I'm not rolling,

04:01:33.661 --> 04:01:34.494
we should be fine.

04:01:34.494 --> 04:01:37.037
LAURA: Oh god!
MATT: It'll be fine.

04:01:37.037 --> 04:01:38.785
Just Polymorph him again next time.
TALIESIN: Modify Memory.

04:01:38.785 --> 04:01:40.276
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:01:41.119 --> 04:01:42.560
You never saw us, turtle,

04:01:42.560 --> 04:01:43.693
you never saw us.
MATT: Yeah, that was awesome.

04:01:43.693 --> 04:01:45.237
That was really well done.

04:01:45.237 --> 04:01:46.574
TRAVIS: Yeah, we would've been fucked otherwise.

04:01:46.574 --> 04:01:47.865
TALIESIN: It was the Tomb Takers.

04:01:47.865 --> 04:01:50.115
The Tomb Takers did that. Run!

04:01:51.827 --> 04:01:53.637
MATT: All righty, so.

04:01:53.637 --> 04:01:54.527
MARISHA: Wow.

04:01:54.527 --> 04:01:57.673
TRAVIS: Seven on one, one on worm.

04:01:58.637 --> 04:02:01.727
TALIESIN: That was clutch.
MATT: Continuing with as intense a speed,

04:02:01.727 --> 04:02:05.556
as you can with Dagen leading the charge,

04:02:05.556 --> 04:02:09.122
while weather is still good.

04:02:09.122 --> 04:02:12.055
You guys feel comfortable enough over the next hour or so

04:02:12.055 --> 04:02:13.929
that you've gotten a fair amount of distance

04:02:13.929 --> 04:02:16.404
before Dagen goes,

04:02:18.329 --> 04:02:20.737
"Not going to lie, that was--

04:02:22.087 --> 04:02:24.030
"it was pretty funny.

04:02:25.477 --> 04:02:28.634
"I've seen those beasts only once before, and

04:02:30.468 --> 04:02:33.624
"yeah, killed a lot of people.

04:02:33.624 --> 04:02:37.167
"I only got away because I-- well,

04:02:37.167 --> 04:02:39.159
"hid in the snow and didn't move."

04:02:39.159 --> 04:02:40.300
LAURA: Wow.

04:02:40.300 --> 04:02:41.725
MATT: "But, um,

04:02:42.809 --> 04:02:45.747
"I think turning it into a tiny turtle works well."

04:02:45.747 --> 04:02:46.737
LAURA: That's a good thing.

04:02:46.737 --> 04:02:47.828
MATT: "How long's that last?"

04:02:47.828 --> 04:02:49.121
LAURA: An hour.

04:02:49.121 --> 04:02:50.079
MATT: "How long's it been?"

04:02:50.079 --> 04:02:51.277
LAURA: (high-pitched) An hour.

04:02:51.277 --> 04:02:52.527
MATT: "Let's keep going."

04:02:54.857 --> 04:02:57.007
You continue on for the remainder of the day,

04:02:57.007 --> 04:03:02.007
your second day of travel, following the tracks northward.

04:03:02.017 --> 04:03:03.797
Now, if you are to continue on this path,

04:03:03.797 --> 04:03:05.987
you now choose whether to continue to follow the tracks,

04:03:05.987 --> 04:03:07.770
which are heading around the bend,

04:03:07.770 --> 04:03:09.647
avoiding Allowak's Sanctuary,

04:03:09.647 --> 04:03:11.417
going on the side of the fire river,

04:03:11.417 --> 04:03:15.839
or attempt to go through the realm of Allowak's Sanctuary

04:03:15.839 --> 04:03:19.117
and take a different path, possibly,

04:03:19.117 --> 04:03:20.297
based on what you were talking about.

04:03:20.297 --> 04:03:21.680
But it's your call.

04:03:23.247 --> 04:03:26.797
SAM: If we went through, would we get ahead of them?

04:03:26.797 --> 04:03:29.137
LAURA: Does it seem shorter to go through the sanctuary?

04:03:29.137 --> 04:03:31.114
TRAVIS: No, I don't think so.

04:03:31.114 --> 04:03:32.647
But again, it's just a map.

04:03:32.647 --> 04:03:36.007
LAURA: Again, yeah, the yetis might know a faster passage

04:03:37.217 --> 04:03:39.107
through the mountains or something.

04:03:39.107 --> 04:03:41.909
TALIESIN: I got a crazy idea. How's the weather?

04:03:41.909 --> 04:03:42.742
TRAVIS: Right now?

04:03:42.742 --> 04:03:43.967
MATT: Right now it's okay.

04:03:45.077 --> 04:03:46.517
TALIESIN: How many of us could fly?

04:03:46.517 --> 04:03:48.357
LIAM: Yeah, want to go over?

04:03:48.357 --> 04:03:50.190
TALIESIN: And just take an hour of flight,

04:03:51.445 --> 04:03:53.095
for as long as the weather holds.

04:03:54.237 --> 04:03:55.327
TRAVIS: We're making the move, huh?

04:03:55.327 --> 04:03:57.777
We're going to pass now?

04:03:57.777 --> 04:04:02.777
TALIESIN: I mean, it'll speed us up a bit.

04:04:03.437 --> 04:04:05.557
MARISHA: And we are for sure trying to go to A2?

04:04:05.557 --> 04:04:08.780
We're not going to try and sidetrack to A4; A2 is the goal.

04:04:09.687 --> 04:04:11.562
TALIESIN: I thought we were going to stop by

04:04:11.562 --> 04:04:15.044
to stop and talk to Essek.

04:04:15.044 --> 04:04:16.837
MARISHA: Essek is further.
LAURA: Essek is so far up.

04:04:16.837 --> 04:04:18.407
TALIESIN: Okay.

04:04:18.407 --> 04:04:21.517
MARISHA: A2 is still along the way,
unless we deviate completely.

04:04:21.517 --> 04:04:26.428
TRAVIS: Well, A2 is technically further away than Aeor is.

04:04:27.620 --> 04:04:29.682
I mean, by a little bit.

04:04:29.682 --> 04:04:32.177
And A2's on this side of the lava river,

04:04:32.177 --> 04:04:33.287
We wouldn't have to cross.

04:04:33.287 --> 04:04:35.247
TALIESIN: So maybe we don't cross, then.

04:04:35.247 --> 04:04:36.483
TRAVIS: If we want to go to A2.

04:04:36.483 --> 04:04:39.027
MARISHA: But we have to cross
the lava river eventually, right?

04:04:39.027 --> 04:04:40.577
TRAVIS: No, not to get to A2.

04:04:40.577 --> 04:04:41.843
MARISHA: Not to get to A2,

04:04:41.843 --> 04:04:45.077
but to get to Aeor, we would have to.

04:04:45.077 --> 04:04:47.427
So we're going to have to, one way or the other.

04:04:49.357 --> 04:04:51.872
TALIESIN: Just depends on where we want to go to first.

04:04:51.872 --> 04:04:54.539
MARISHA: It feels like it's between A2 and A4, right?

04:04:55.447 --> 04:04:58.550
TRAVIS: Yeah, the lava river literally splits A2 and Aeor.

04:04:59.937 --> 04:05:01.437
LAURA: Anybody want to flip a coin?

04:05:02.317 --> 04:05:03.442
SAM: I vote A2.

04:05:05.227 --> 04:05:06.597
TRAVIS: Is there a reason?

04:05:06.597 --> 04:05:07.783
SAM: That's where they're going.

04:05:07.783 --> 04:05:08.650
LIAM: That's where they're going.

04:05:08.650 --> 04:05:10.577
We could maybe try to beat them there

04:05:10.577 --> 04:05:12.857
and get what they're after, and--

04:05:12.857 --> 04:05:15.417
LAURA: Try to leave before they show up?

04:05:15.417 --> 04:05:17.987
MARISHA: If we go to A2, I don't see any point in going

04:05:17.987 --> 04:05:19.896
unless we try and beat them there.

04:05:19.896 --> 04:05:21.117
SAM: For sure.

04:05:21.117 --> 04:05:24.317
MARISHA: Or we deviate and we go to A4

04:05:24.317 --> 04:05:26.577
and we don't have competition.

04:05:26.577 --> 04:05:28.635
SAM: Do we know how big A4 is?

04:05:28.635 --> 04:05:31.707
Because like, if it's gigantic,

04:05:31.707 --> 04:05:34.310
we won't even know what to look for.

04:05:36.028 --> 04:05:37.602
TALIESIN: The only reason we'll know what to look for,

04:05:37.602 --> 04:05:39.460
is when they decide they have it.

04:05:43.727 --> 04:05:44.657
I could--

04:05:44.657 --> 04:05:47.463
TRAVIS: We can do it. We should also just

04:05:47.463 --> 04:05:49.817
see if we're being watched before we do it,

04:05:49.817 --> 04:05:52.427
because we make the move, they'll know.

04:05:52.427 --> 04:05:55.280
ASHLEY: But how do we know that they're not going to--

04:05:55.280 --> 04:05:57.015
We know that they're going to A2.

04:05:57.015 --> 04:05:59.177
TALIESIN: We want to make sure they're going to A2,

04:05:59.177 --> 04:06:01.077
We want to see if we're not being watched.

04:06:01.077 --> 04:06:02.527
What else do we need to know?

04:06:04.130 --> 04:06:06.257
LIAM: I feel like we should assume

04:06:06.257 --> 04:06:08.207
that we will be seen no matter what we do

04:06:08.207 --> 04:06:10.977
and we just book it.

04:06:10.977 --> 04:06:12.200
LAURA: Divine Intervention.

04:06:13.377 --> 04:06:14.230
MATT: Make the roll.

04:06:15.167 --> 04:06:16.337
SAM: This is it, this is the one.

04:06:16.337 --> 04:06:18.580
MATT: What is it you want from the intervention?

04:06:18.580 --> 04:06:20.528
LAURA: I want--
SAM: To win.

04:06:21.586 --> 04:06:23.003
LAURA: I want to know.

04:06:24.593 --> 04:06:27.558
TRAVIS: ♪ I want to know what love is ♪

04:06:27.558 --> 04:06:28.583
LAURA: I want to know

04:06:32.137 --> 04:06:35.970
if it's wiser to go to A4.

04:06:37.297 --> 04:06:40.660
If we'll find something to beat the Tomb Takers

04:06:40.660 --> 04:06:41.577
at their game.

04:06:47.067 --> 04:06:50.269
MARISHA: Come on, Traveler, you piece of shit.

04:06:50.269 --> 04:06:51.102
LAURA: Don't call him that!

04:06:51.102 --> 04:06:52.257
TRAVIS: Artagan.

04:06:52.257 --> 04:06:55.217
MARISHA: Sorry. Come on, Artagan, you piece of shit.

04:06:55.217 --> 04:06:57.810
LAURA: I'm looking for my percentile. Where is it?

04:06:57.810 --> 04:06:59.227
Here it is, okay.

04:07:03.627 --> 04:07:04.460
Nope!

04:07:06.768 --> 04:07:09.202
TALIESIN: Can we think of a third question?

04:07:09.202 --> 04:07:10.927
TRAVIS: Oh.
LAURA: Oh!

04:07:10.927 --> 04:07:12.535
SAM: Third question?
LAURA: Oh, communing.

04:07:12.535 --> 04:07:13.552
TALIESIN: Yeah.

04:07:13.552 --> 04:07:15.567
TRAVIS: Right. Should we head to A2?

04:07:15.567 --> 04:07:17.293
What would the second one be?

04:07:17.293 --> 04:07:18.787
TALIESIN: Are they going to A2?

04:07:18.787 --> 04:07:20.657
Are we being watched?

04:07:20.657 --> 04:07:25.323
MARISHA: Are there threshold crests

04:07:25.323 --> 04:07:26.948
at A4 or A2?

04:07:26.948 --> 04:07:31.493
Because we know Molly is going-- Lucien is going to A2.

04:07:31.493 --> 04:07:32.326
TALIESIN: Is there a threshold crest?

04:07:32.326 --> 04:07:34.936
LIAM: Remind me why we think A4 instead of

04:07:34.936 --> 04:07:37.067
Aeor itself?

04:07:37.067 --> 04:07:39.337
LAURA: Because I think Aeor is the final goal.

04:07:39.337 --> 04:07:42.007
LIAM: Wouldn't that be to alpha and then alpha

04:07:42.007 --> 04:07:43.397
and then Aeor being alpha?

04:07:43.397 --> 04:07:44.430
TRAVIS: A4 is further east,

04:07:44.430 --> 04:07:45.965
keep saying Aeor.
LAURA: Yeah, to alpha and alpha

04:07:45.965 --> 04:07:48.624
LIAM: Right. So why A4?

04:07:48.624 --> 04:07:51.254
LAURA: Because A4 might have another special--

04:07:51.254 --> 04:07:53.365
TRAVIS: No, it's under Foren,
it's further east from those two.

04:07:53.365 --> 04:07:56.007
Before Aeor and A2,

04:07:56.007 --> 04:07:57.357
are the one we're heading towards.

04:07:57.357 --> 04:07:59.497
MARISHA: Right.
TRAVIS: And A4 is, like, to the east.

04:08:01.161 --> 04:08:03.561
TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to roll a Commune.

04:08:06.747 --> 04:08:07.587
MATT: All righty.

04:08:07.587 --> 04:08:10.734
TALIESIN: I'm just going to dig myself a little hole

04:08:10.734 --> 04:08:12.475
in the snow.

04:08:14.934 --> 04:08:15.775
Breathe deep.

04:08:15.775 --> 04:08:19.538
And once it's taking hold:

04:08:22.928 --> 04:08:25.805
Are the Tomb Takers heading to A2?

04:08:27.735 --> 04:08:29.477
MATT: As you close your eyes, the cold seems

04:08:29.477 --> 04:08:32.235
to subside momentarily, and...

04:08:34.443 --> 04:08:36.884
as you exhale, you feel the warm breath

04:08:36.884 --> 04:08:40.477
almost drawn out of you, not in a suffocating way,

04:08:40.477 --> 04:08:43.357
but in a guided way.

04:08:43.357 --> 04:08:45.437
And the breath seems to draw you

04:08:45.437 --> 04:08:48.030
in a north-northwestern direction.

04:08:50.027 --> 04:08:51.477
TALIESIN: Have they been watching us?

04:08:53.707 --> 04:08:55.577
MATT: As you inhale once more

04:08:55.577 --> 04:08:59.993
the freezing cold air that you've been...

04:08:59.993 --> 04:09:02.051
accustomed to inhaling,

04:09:04.309 --> 04:09:06.842
begins to lose its cold temperature

04:09:06.842 --> 04:09:09.523
and become almost beachside warm.

04:09:11.427 --> 04:09:14.019
SAM: Is that a yes or a no?
LIAM: That's a yes.

04:09:14.019 --> 04:09:17.084
MARISHA: Wait, so both were warm?
MATT: Both were warm.

04:09:23.639 --> 04:09:26.067
TALIESIN: Does one of these threshold crests

04:09:26.067 --> 04:09:29.188
that they're looking for exist at A4?

04:09:31.537 --> 04:09:36.537
MATT: The air doesn't-- it reverts to a colder temperature

04:09:36.827 --> 04:09:39.690
but not the freezing temperature that hurts the lungs.

04:09:40.919 --> 04:09:44.307
TALIESIN: That was the wrong question, it's unclear.

04:09:44.307 --> 04:09:47.310
I don't necessarily know if they're collecting those or--?

04:09:48.977 --> 04:09:49.810
TRAVIS: Something else?
TALIESIN: It wasn't a

04:09:49.810 --> 04:09:51.767
yes or a no, it was just,

04:09:51.767 --> 04:09:53.067
it was the wrong question.

04:09:55.201 --> 04:09:58.637
I don't think they're collecting threshold crests.

04:09:58.637 --> 04:10:00.780
I think they're collecting things.

04:10:04.112 --> 04:10:06.637
I don't know, that's my thought.

04:10:09.397 --> 04:10:11.167
TRAVIS: We are being watched?

04:10:11.167 --> 04:10:12.000
TALIESIN: We are.

04:10:15.460 --> 04:10:17.147
TRAVIS: Do we--

04:10:17.147 --> 04:10:19.130
SAM: There's no way to protect against that?

04:10:21.217 --> 04:10:22.050
TALIESIN: Not that I can think of.

04:10:22.050 --> 04:10:23.383
LAURA: I mean, I have this on.
LIAM: It could be happening at any time

04:10:23.383 --> 04:10:25.258
and we don't know when.

04:10:25.258 --> 04:10:26.999
MARISHA: Those are the only three questions you get,

04:10:26.999 --> 04:10:28.112
it's not five?

04:10:29.837 --> 04:10:31.667
MATT: Five is Speak with Dead.

04:10:31.667 --> 04:10:34.147
TALIESIN: Five is Speak with Dead, three is speak with god.

04:10:34.147 --> 04:10:35.697
LAURA: Is it time to talk to...

04:10:36.757 --> 04:10:39.297
TALIESIN: One more day, I think.
LIAM: One more day.

04:10:39.297 --> 04:10:41.909
LAURA: Okay.
SAM: ♪ One more day! ♪

04:10:41.909 --> 04:10:44.577
MATT: All right.
TRAVIS: I could look...

04:10:44.577 --> 04:10:46.272
and see.
LAURA: Look and see what?

04:10:46.272 --> 04:10:49.944
TRAVIS: If something is successfully watching us, or you.

04:10:49.944 --> 04:10:52.385
Should I try that?
SAM: What, like See Invisibility?

04:10:52.385 --> 04:10:53.843
Sure, yeah.
TRAVIS: All right.

04:10:53.843 --> 04:10:57.626
I'll take the sword and I'll cast See Invisibility.

04:10:57.626 --> 04:10:59.621
MATT: Okay, glancing on the space around you,

04:10:59.621 --> 04:11:03.190
you do not see any sign of a similar scrying beacon.

04:11:04.997 --> 04:11:07.250
TRAVIS: It actually seems clear right now.

04:11:07.250 --> 04:11:09.287
TALIESIN: I think they probably poke in on us on occasion.

04:11:09.287 --> 04:11:11.657
LAURA: The same way that I do, yeah.

04:11:11.657 --> 04:11:13.507
TRAVIS: Be a good time to make a move then.

04:11:16.237 --> 04:11:20.356
TALIESIN: I think we need help, it's my feeling.

04:11:20.356 --> 04:11:21.606
LAURA: Talk to Essek?

04:11:21.606 --> 04:11:22.980
TALIESIN: It's my feeling, is we need help.

04:11:24.187 --> 04:11:26.417
TRAVIS: Essek is far away from A2.

04:11:28.123 --> 04:11:29.637
LIAM: Well, if they're going to A2

04:11:29.637 --> 04:11:34.087
and we could try to beat them there,

04:11:34.087 --> 04:11:36.407
figure out what it is they're after there,

04:11:36.407 --> 04:11:38.198
take it, once we do that,

04:11:38.198 --> 04:11:42.207
we are daring them to attack,

04:11:42.207 --> 04:11:45.377
but we could take whatever we find straight

04:11:45.377 --> 04:11:48.474
to Aeor, which is where Essek is, correct?

04:11:48.474 --> 04:11:50.417
He's on the edge of it.
TRAVIS: Yes.

04:11:52.936 --> 04:11:55.897
SAM: If we can do all that, that would be amazing.

04:11:55.897 --> 04:11:58.277
TALIESIN: Lucien may continue to play it as a game, too,

04:11:58.277 --> 04:11:59.607
and just see how many of these things

04:11:59.607 --> 04:12:01.807
that we'll get <i>for</i> him.

04:12:01.807 --> 04:12:02.797
LIAM: That's true.

04:12:02.797 --> 04:12:04.597
TALIESIN: As long as we're all taking it to the same place,

04:12:04.597 --> 04:12:07.647
I doubt it really even matters to him who has what,

04:12:07.647 --> 04:12:09.397
if it ends up where it needs to be.

04:12:10.627 --> 04:12:11.524
TRAVIS: Are we flying?

04:12:12.577 --> 04:12:13.497
SAM: Can we fly?

04:12:13.497 --> 04:12:15.572
MATT: Flying only lasts for 10 minutes.

04:12:16.913 --> 04:12:19.029
LIAM: Polymorph.
LAURA: Polymorph.

04:12:19.029 --> 04:12:20.804
MATT: Polymorph would help, yeah.

04:12:22.497 --> 04:12:23.630
LAURA: I mean.

04:12:24.807 --> 04:12:27.490
TALIESIN: If we're crossing the river.
LAURA: If we're crossing the river.

04:12:27.490 --> 04:12:29.617
TRAVIS: For A2 we don't need to cross.

04:12:29.617 --> 04:12:32.147
LIAM: But even if we aren't crossing the river,

04:12:32.147 --> 04:12:35.257
I thought the idea was to try to gain pace for a bit.

04:12:35.257 --> 04:12:37.217
Yeah, I could do that...
LAURA: Be fast.

04:12:37.217 --> 04:12:38.407
LIAM: -- a couple of times, too.

04:12:38.407 --> 04:12:41.874
We could fly, pause and re-up and...

04:12:41.874 --> 04:12:43.917
TALIESIN: As long as we don't want to
burn everything we have

04:12:43.917 --> 04:12:45.367
in case something happens.

04:12:46.787 --> 04:12:47.917
TRAVIS: Let's fly.

04:12:49.212 --> 04:12:50.045
MARISHA: Okay.

04:12:50.045 --> 04:12:51.880
TRAVIS: Who can do what, how are we doing it?

04:12:53.377 --> 04:12:57.477
LIAM: All right, this is the plan for now, for this moment?

04:12:57.477 --> 04:13:00.966
MARISHA: I guess we're going to A2,
trying to beat them there.

04:13:00.966 --> 04:13:01.799
LIAM: All right.

04:13:03.931 --> 04:13:04.957
(whoosh)

04:13:04.957 --> 04:13:06.157
Giant eagle.

04:13:07.124 --> 04:13:08.617
TRAVIS: And you can carry two?

04:13:08.617 --> 04:13:09.558
LIAM: Yeah.

04:13:12.726 --> 04:13:14.270
LAURA: If I Polymorph two people

04:13:15.427 --> 04:13:17.659
will we all be able to travel?

04:13:17.659 --> 04:13:20.147
SAM: We got to bring Dagen, too.
LAURA: Yeah.

04:13:20.147 --> 04:13:22.932
LAURA: You can carry two?
TRAVIS: Ah, Dagen!

04:13:22.932 --> 04:13:24.510
LAURA: That's okay, two, two, two.
TALIESIN: Two, two, two.

04:13:24.510 --> 04:13:25.343
That should work.

04:13:25.343 --> 04:13:28.451
LAURA: Okay, then I will use my...

04:13:28.451 --> 04:13:31.603
Ring of Spell-Splitting.

04:13:31.603 --> 04:13:32.603
MATT: All righty.

04:13:34.188 --> 04:13:36.377
LAURA: Do you want to be an eagle?
ASHLEY: Yeah!

04:13:36.377 --> 04:13:39.587
LAURA: I'm going to cast Polymorph on me and Yasha.

04:13:39.587 --> 04:13:42.617
MATT: All righty, and with that, you have three giant eagles

04:13:42.617 --> 04:13:44.617
at your disposal. Who's riding with who?

04:13:44.617 --> 04:13:46.785
LIAM: I start sidling up to Dagen.

04:13:46.785 --> 04:13:49.341
(eagle cry and wings flutter)

04:13:49.341 --> 04:13:51.447
TALIESIN: Yasha, do you mind?

04:13:51.447 --> 04:13:53.237
MATT: "Man, your tricks are all kinds of weird,

04:13:53.237 --> 04:13:54.494
"but I like your style."

04:13:54.494 --> 04:13:57.284
LIAM: And I grab his ride and then--

04:13:58.184 --> 04:14:00.901
MATT: (screams nervously) "Up! Up?"

04:14:02.507 --> 04:14:03.697
MARISHA: Just screaming "up."

04:14:03.697 --> 04:14:05.810
LAURA: Fjord and Veth, here we go!

04:14:06.987 --> 04:14:08.377
MATT: All righty.

04:14:08.377 --> 04:14:11.197
ASHLEY: (eagle cawing)

04:14:11.197 --> 04:14:12.275
MATT: And with that,

04:14:12.275 --> 04:14:16.750
the three eagles push into the light snow

04:14:16.750 --> 04:14:18.741
as the evening grows on.

04:14:18.741 --> 04:14:20.367
The final hour of your night's travel

04:14:20.367 --> 04:14:23.207
will be through the air,

04:14:23.207 --> 04:14:25.177
with the fading light probably helping you

04:14:25.177 --> 04:14:27.997
from possibly garnishing the attention

04:14:27.997 --> 04:14:29.950
of those you're supposed to be following.

04:14:31.087 --> 04:14:32.234
And we'll pick up from there next week.

04:14:32.234 --> 04:14:33.727
(oohing)

04:14:33.727 --> 04:14:35.337
MARISHA: Flying off into the sunset.

04:14:35.337 --> 04:14:36.812
TRAVIS: Good recovery, good recovery.

04:14:36.812 --> 04:14:38.359
Good turtle.

04:14:38.359 --> 04:14:40.522
ASHLEY: Oh man, that was so funny.

04:14:40.522 --> 04:14:41.994
MATT: Man, that was fucking hilarious.

04:14:41.994 --> 04:14:42.827
MARISHA: So funny.

04:14:42.827 --> 04:14:45.887
MATT: That was hilarious.
LAURA: We all got group stunned.

04:14:45.887 --> 04:14:47.979
MATT: I'm not going to lie, I was
a little worried when that happened.

04:14:47.979 --> 04:14:50.027
I was like, "Oh!"
ASHLEY: Uh-oh.

04:14:50.027 --> 04:14:53.079
MATT: Okay yeah, that was a full Ashley Johnson "uh-oh."

04:14:53.079 --> 04:14:55.329
(laughter)

04:14:56.277 --> 04:14:58.476
TALIESIN: Fucking Jester MVP in that shit.

04:14:58.476 --> 04:14:59.917
TRAVIS: Yeah!
TALIESIN: Fuck, man!

04:14:59.917 --> 04:15:03.757
MATT: Mind you, a part of me was--
I was excited for the carnage.

04:15:03.757 --> 04:15:04.590
LIAM: Me too.

04:15:04.590 --> 04:15:07.357
MATT: But that was fucking hilarious
and very clever, well done.

04:15:07.357 --> 04:15:09.023
TALIESIN: Oh god. I had a heart attack.

04:15:09.023 --> 04:15:11.312
LIAM: And just culminating in a piece of glitter on the map.

04:15:11.312 --> 04:15:12.927
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: (laughs)

04:15:12.927 --> 04:15:15.574
MARISHA: That he moved to attack me.

04:15:15.574 --> 04:15:18.156
LIAM: Oh, it flipped.
SAM: It flipped upside down for some reason.

04:15:18.156 --> 04:15:19.797
TALIESIN: I just feel like that's a metaphor for something,

04:15:19.797 --> 04:15:21.968
but I'm not sure what.
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah.

04:15:22.932 --> 04:15:24.247
MATT: I like to imagine he didn't have the movement

04:15:24.247 --> 04:15:26.797
to get to you, but because it was ice

04:15:26.797 --> 04:15:29.711
he just, like, coasted part of the way.

04:15:29.711 --> 04:15:31.669
And then-- (small stepping)

04:15:31.669 --> 04:15:32.502
Anyway.

04:15:32.502 --> 04:15:35.177
All right, well, we'll pick up from there not next week

04:15:35.177 --> 04:15:36.577
because we have Thanksgiving next week,

04:15:36.577 --> 04:15:40.152
but the week after that.

04:15:40.152 --> 04:15:40.993
All right then.

04:15:40.993 --> 04:15:43.987
Well, guys, have a wonderful time.

04:15:43.987 --> 04:15:44.867
We love you very much.

04:15:44.867 --> 04:15:46.947
And, is it Thursday yet?

04:15:46.947 --> 04:15:47.780
Good night!

04:15:47.780 --> 04:15:49.472
(cheering)

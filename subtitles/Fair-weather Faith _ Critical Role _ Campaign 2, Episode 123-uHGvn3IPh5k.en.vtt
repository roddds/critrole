MATT: Hello, everyone and welcome
to tonight's episode of Critical Role,

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:03.780
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.520
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.053
ALL: (discordant yelling) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.072
MATT: Before we get started tonight, we have--

00:00:14.072 --> 00:00:15.040
(laughter)

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.260
We have some announcements to get through

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.180
beginning with our two sponsors tonight.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.740
The first of which is

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.420
Petersen Games.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.020
For those who aren't familiar with their upcoming book,

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.410
they're doing their fifth edition, Cthulhu Mythos.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.050
Amazing source book for fifth edition

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.870
with all the fantastic cosmic horror

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:32.473
of the Cthulhu Mythos involved.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.993
This book is fucking gorgeous, the art is amazing.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.690
But it brings the epic horror of the Cthulhu Mythos

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.172
to fifth edition.

00:00:41.172 --> 00:00:44.233
With 400 pages. It's a weighty tome.

00:00:44.233 --> 00:00:48.500
Full hardcover color awesomeness.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.910
I should read but I'm so excited

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.990
to keep just talking about without looking at it.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.430
Designed by the legend himself, Sandy Petersen.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.055
The massive tome contains over 100

00:00:56.055 --> 00:00:57.830
Cthulhu Mythos monster stats,

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.854
26 great old one stats and outer gods stats

00:01:00.854 --> 00:01:03.500
to just wipe your party immediately.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.260
Four new playable races, new character options, professions,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.317
feats, rules for insanity and dreaming

00:01:09.317 --> 00:01:11.503
as well as dozens of detailed Mythos cults--

00:01:11.503 --> 00:01:12.510
MARISHA: Dreaming!
MATT: -- 40 new spells,

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.900
30 rituals, and our new metric rule set,

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.080
plus dozens of Mythos items and artifacts.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.870
There is so much in this book

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.620
and I can't get over the horrifying creature designs

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:25.920
and drawings in there.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.850
I love this book.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.380
So anyway, make sure to check out after the video

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.900
during the break for a bunch of information about this

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.470
and as a special offer to our audience right now,

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.770
if you use the code, criticalrole, one word

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.650
when checking out at petersengames.com,

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.240
you get $20 off the source book, which is awesome.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.670
So thanks, Petersen Games, for sponsoring us tonight.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.720
And go check them out at petersengames.com.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.260
(cheering)

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.060
I'm going to keep this one.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.640
And our second sponsor for tonight,

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.770
our friends at Tabletop Tycoon.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.360
Sam, if you don't mind.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.408
SAM: Are you imbalanced--
TRAVIS: Jesus.

00:01:58.408 --> 00:02:00.840
SAM: --stuck in the dice tray of life?

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.170
Does it feel like you're always rolling snake eyes?

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.750
Well, welcome to the self-help seminar

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.820
that will boost your luck forever.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.755
Hi, I'm Nathaniel "Nat" Twenty,

00:02:10.755 --> 00:02:15.070
a motivational speaker, guru, and sentient piece of plastic.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.480
This patented method will give you the tools

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.217
to uncock your dice and unlock the advantage within.

00:02:22.217 --> 00:02:23.050
MATT: Oh, no.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.287
SAM: My book, Dodeca-Heal Yourself--
LAURA: Oh my god!

00:02:26.287 --> 00:02:31.287
(laughter)

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.328
TRAVIS: It shouldn't look that good.

00:02:33.328 --> 00:02:38.328
(laughter continues)

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.540
SAM: Dodeca-Heal Yourself, the 20 sides to a better you

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.080
is only the beginning.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.740
Through my seminars, workshops,

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.350
and expensive one-on-one dice coaching sessions,

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.741
I will change your inspiration from a d4--

00:02:50.741 --> 00:02:52.274
MARISHA: Oh, I hate this guy.
SAM: --to a d10.

00:02:52.274 --> 00:02:53.870
(laughter)

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.180
And today, just for the people in this room

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.470
and the students watching my seminar at home,

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.320
I'm announcing a special sponsorship partnership

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.170
with Tabletop Tycoon and their forthcoming campaign

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.808
for their PolyHero Dice.

00:03:07.808 --> 00:03:09.240
(surprised noise)

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.450
Channel the divine with dice for clerics of all types

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.770
and bless your whole party

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.420
with new sets for warriors, rogues, and wizards.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.670
Each cleric set includes eight dice including hammer,

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.630
mace, and healing potions.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.050
Also available is a remastered Warrior Set

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.110
and the popular rogue and wizard dice sets

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.330
with some new fancy colors.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:30.673
Each set comes with two d20s

00:03:30.673 --> 00:03:32.820
and more colors and styles will be unlocked

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.770
as more support <i>rolls</i> in.

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.910
Now, to show you the power of the PolyHero Dice

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:39.880
and my system.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.822
I want you all to repeat this mantra after me.

00:03:42.822 --> 00:03:44.650
MATT: (resigned) Okay.
SAM: "I commit."

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:45.483
ALL: I commit.

00:03:45.483 --> 00:03:47.258
SAM: "I admit."
ALL: I admit.

00:03:47.258 --> 00:03:48.149
SAM: "I am fit."

00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:48.982
ALL: I am fit.

00:03:48.982 --> 00:03:49.955
SAM: "I will crit."

00:03:49.955 --> 00:03:50.910
ALL: I will crit.
(laughter)

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.550
SAM: Now grab your d20s and roll them
and show me what you got.

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.967
Tell me what you rolled.
LAURA: Can we roll with advantage?

00:03:56.967 --> 00:03:57.984
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

00:03:57.984 --> 00:03:59.063
(laughter)

00:03:59.063 --> 00:04:00.176
SAM: The system works.

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:02.741
LAURA: 19!

00:04:02.741 --> 00:04:04.780
SAM: 19, yes!

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.230
TRAVIS: We should be rolling shittier, you guys.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.480
LIAM: I got 11 and a one on my wizard hat and book.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.182
SAM: You need more seminars.

00:04:10.182 --> 00:04:11.701
(laughter)

00:04:11.701 --> 00:04:12.600
ASHLEY: 14!

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.928
SAM: 14's good!

00:04:13.928 --> 00:04:16.203
TALIESIN: Four. Yeah.
SAM: All right. Some work.

00:04:16.203 --> 00:04:19.980
MARISHA: I was going to roll the d2, but then you said d20.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:20.850
15?

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.200
SAM: Yes! Amazing! The system works. My--

00:04:26.108 --> 00:04:27.416
I mean, not for you guys.

00:04:27.416 --> 00:04:28.372
You two.

00:04:28.372 --> 00:04:30.270
(laughter)

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.590
You need my 10 course seminar.

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.800
Don't worry, I've already charged your credit cards.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.740
Until then, don't nat one in life,

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.130
be the one who makes crit happen.

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.920
If you unlock your inner advantage

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.430
and check out the PolyHero Dice and loads of add-ons

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.608
at bit.ly/CRTabletopTycoon,

00:04:46.608 --> 00:04:48.630
there's no telling how high you'll roll.

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.030
Remember, don't wait for a nat 20.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.532
One is already waiting for you.

00:04:53.532 --> 00:04:56.270
(uncomfortable laughter)

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.566
Matt, back to you.

00:04:57.566 --> 00:04:59.140
MATT: (laughs)

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.700
TRAVIS: Nathaniel, can you hold one fist up like this?

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.804
Can you go, "It's a me?"

00:05:03.804 --> 00:05:06.617
(laughter)

00:05:06.617 --> 00:05:08.670
SAM: It's a-me, Mario!

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.180
LIAM: Not since Taryon Darrington

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.504
has there been such a polarizing character.

00:05:12.504 --> 00:05:15.171
(laughter)

00:05:17.105 --> 00:05:18.146
MATT: Thank you, Sam.

00:05:19.743 --> 00:05:21.034
LAURA: I love it.

00:05:21.034 --> 00:05:23.675
It's so good.
ASHLEY: I love it. I love it.

00:05:23.675 --> 00:05:25.190
MATT: Thank you, Sam.
SAM: Thank you, Matt.

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.260
MATT: And thank you, Tabletop Tycoon.
TRAVIS: And we're sorry.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.310
MATT: We're really sorry.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.800
All right. Our last announcement for the night,

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.560
I reminded last week but also just so you guys know

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.520
we are now broadcasting
Critical Role on both-- and Talks Machina--

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.240
both on Twitch and the YouTube channels.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.230
You know, the YouTubes,
where the kids go to watch the stuff.

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:46.930
But the best place of course is still to participate

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.410
in the community and live experience

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.880
is here on our Twitch page and Twitch channel.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.180
So tonight's video will be available right away on Twitch,

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.800
and for channel subscribers, and this episode

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.350
will be uploaded to YouTube as VOD on Monday

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.023
at noon Pacific, per usual.

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.536
I think that's it.

00:06:03.536 --> 00:06:05.270
That being the case, let's go ahead and jump into

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.686
tonight's episode of...

00:06:07.686 --> 00:06:08.686
Critical Role.

00:06:08.686 --> 00:06:11.009
TRAVIS: We're gonna kill Caleb and Beau.

00:06:11.009 --> 00:06:13.009
(water bubbling)

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:15.609
(thunder rumbling)

00:06:18.154 --> 00:06:19.379
(explosion)

00:06:20.234 --> 00:06:21.348
? Role ?

00:06:21.348 --> 00:06:26.209
? Critical Role ?

00:06:26.209 --> 00:06:28.926
? Critical Role ?

00:06:28.926 --> 00:06:32.160
? Mighty Nein, Mighty Nein ?

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.839
? Roll the dice, roll the dice (dice, dice) ?

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:38.996
? The adventure begins ?

00:06:38.996 --> 00:06:41.149
? They were always beside you ?

00:06:41.149 --> 00:06:43.224
? Your nerdy best friends ?

00:06:43.224 --> 00:06:45.377
? And the DM to guide you ?

00:06:45.377 --> 00:06:49.711
? And they rise from the flames for the battles ahead ?

00:06:49.711 --> 00:06:53.715
? Villains beware 'cause you're about to be dead ?

00:06:53.715 --> 00:06:57.865
(heroic music)

00:06:57.865 --> 00:07:00.083
? They got magic and flair ?

00:07:00.083 --> 00:07:02.159
? They got falchions and cunning ?

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:04.218
? They don't see over there ?

00:07:04.218 --> 00:07:06.394
? There's a monster incoming ?

00:07:06.394 --> 00:07:08.411
? Inspiration is waiting ?

00:07:08.411 --> 00:07:10.590
? Rise up, don't think twice ?

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.265
? Put your fate in your hands ?

00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:14.315
? Take a chance, roll the dice ?

00:07:14.315 --> 00:07:16.088
? Roll the dice (Role) ?

00:07:16.088 --> 00:07:20.900
? Critical Role (roll the dice) ?

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.154
? Critical Role (roll the dice) ?

00:07:23.154 --> 00:07:25.222
? Can you answer the call? ?

00:07:25.222 --> 00:07:27.491
? Dig in deep in your soul ?

00:07:27.491 --> 00:07:29.579
? As the legend unfolds ?

00:07:29.579 --> 00:07:33.441
? Now it's your turn (your turn, your turn) ?

00:07:33.441 --> 00:07:37.874
? To roll ?

00:07:39.263 --> 00:07:42.713
(flames whooshing)

00:07:42.713 --> 00:07:45.279
(dragon roaring)

00:07:46.617 --> 00:07:48.854
MATT: And welcome back.

00:07:48.854 --> 00:07:51.610
So last we left off:

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:53.980
The Mighty Nein has been traveling

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:56.573
closer and closer to the ruins of Aeor.

00:07:57.474 --> 00:07:59.540
And along this path they found themselves

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:03.280
having to travel alongside the quarry they were following

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.941
as Lucien and the Tomb Takers hit them off

00:08:06.941 --> 00:08:09.420
and decided to keep each other close,

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:13.928
like you would with a proper untrusting enemy.

00:08:13.928 --> 00:08:16.390
Went through some conversations and some travel

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:19.940
and a couple of dangerous encounters along the way.

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:21.333
You've bonded a bit,

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:23.635
shared some things,

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:27.330
one of which involved requesting and persuading

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:30.340
Lucien to show the tome which began his journey

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:33.103
as the Nonagon long ago.

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:35.980
Both Caleb and Beauregard took point

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:37.750
to read through this book to ascertain information

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:40.161
and glean quite a bit about

00:08:40.161 --> 00:08:42.510
where a lot of this seemed to have begun.

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:46.590
Learned some information about Aeor, Cognouza,

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:50.173
and where these Somnovem may have come from.

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:54.124
But also seemed to find something

00:08:54.124 --> 00:08:57.130
far more sinister and unexplainable deeper into the book

00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:59.030
before it was snatched back by Lucien.

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:02.830
You've found yourselves lost in an ice fog

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:04.900
and lost a day of travel right on the cusp

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:06.710
of arriving at your destination

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:08.040
and took to one more night's rest

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.520
where you invited the Tomb Takers in to sleep.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.200
They found their quarters.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:16.424
You found yours and began to plot what to do

00:09:16.424 --> 00:09:18.710
in the near future for the safety of yourselves

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:22.323
and or halting the plot of Lucien the Nonagon.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.470
You all went to sleep.

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:26.940
In that night's rest,

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:30.160
Caleb and Beauregard began to see familiar patterns

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.840
that they had from the book they had read before.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:33.798
In that darkness,

00:09:33.798 --> 00:09:36.393
a single glowing red eye came to them,

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:39.630
bid them welcome along with a chorus

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:42.713
of hundreds of distant buzzing screams.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:46.570
You both shot awake and found on your person

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:50.500
a newly apparated red eye,

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:55.458
not unlike those upon Lucien and your friend Mollymauk.

00:09:56.589 --> 00:10:00.010
So as you return, you have both shot awake.

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:02.860
Caleb has disrobed a little bit to look for

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:03.870
and finding the eye

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:05.330
and the rest of you are starting to come to

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.050
in the midst of this chaos, this tension,

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:11.420
and look up to see this point of recognition

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:12.270
between the two of them.

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:15.905
And Fjord, who is awake through this, also taking in

00:10:15.905 --> 00:10:18.010
the repercussions or the connotations

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:20.085
of what has just transpired.

00:10:24.559 --> 00:10:26.040
LAURA: What's going on?

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:30.160
MARISHA: A really bad dream.

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:31.576
LAURA: Wake up!
SAM: Ah!

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:34.640
LAURA: Why are you naked?

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.694
LIAM: I'm not naked. I'm wearing pants.

00:10:36.694 --> 00:10:38.268
LAURA: Well...

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.513
TRAVIS: You better have a wizard's explanation for that

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:46.190
and for hers.

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:48.385
LAURA: Is it glowing? Is it glowing?

00:10:48.385 --> 00:10:50.051
MATT: It's not glowing.
LAURA: It's just like a red...

00:10:50.051 --> 00:10:52.573
MATT: Just like a red-- it looks almost like a tattoo.

00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:57.093
LIAM: And very obviously like Mollymauk's.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.844
MATT: Precisely like Mollymauk's.
LAURA: I'm going to

00:10:59.844 --> 00:11:01.035
crawl out of bed and run over

00:11:01.035 --> 00:11:03.040
and take Beau's hand and start looking at it.

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:05.163
MARISHA: I shove Caduceus awake.

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:08.090
LAURA: Does it feel raised?

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:11.376
Does it feel just fully flat, like it's...

00:11:11.376 --> 00:11:13.850
MATT: It has a texture that is different from the skin.

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:15.730
It feels smooth.

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:16.740
Like there is no...

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:21.710
There is no natural ridges that the skin would

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:23.111
maintain around it as well.

00:11:23.111 --> 00:11:26.964
It's just a perfectly smooth surface where the eye is.

00:11:26.964 --> 00:11:31.647
And do Beauregard or I feel

00:11:31.647 --> 00:11:34.555
or sense anything or hear anything?

00:11:34.555 --> 00:11:37.420
Or is there anything different other than the appearance?

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:38.795
MATT: Just the appearance.

00:11:39.803 --> 00:11:40.636
For now.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.113
LIAM: Just a little light reading.

00:11:46.113 --> 00:11:48.378
TRAVIS: You both woke up at the same time.

00:11:48.378 --> 00:11:51.950
Do you care to share what might've been happening

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:53.093
just before that?

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:58.926
MARISHA: I honestly can't remember
a whole lot, except for...

00:12:00.101 --> 00:12:01.051
the voices.

00:12:01.051 --> 00:12:03.012
Did you hear the voices?

00:12:03.012 --> 00:12:08.000
LIAM: A big red eye and thousands of voices.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.570
MARISHA: Welcoming us.

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:10.703
LAURA: <i>Welcoming</i> you?

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.152
MARISHA: Just whispers of welcome,
welcome, welcome, welcome.

00:12:15.152 --> 00:12:16.743
Just...

00:12:16.743 --> 00:12:17.959
endless...

00:12:19.276 --> 00:12:20.517
cacophony.

00:12:21.390 --> 00:12:24.340
LAURA: Can you hear it now? You can't hear it now?

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:26.060
MARISHA: Can I hear it now?

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:27.030
MATT: No.

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:29.880
SAM: Are you evil in some way?

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:30.840
LIAM: In some ways.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.533
SAM: Well, I mean more evil.

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:36.210
TALIESIN: If they were, would they tell you?

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:39.803
SAM: Can't you sense that? Don't
you have ways of sensing evil?

00:12:41.221 --> 00:12:42.404
TALIESIN: I mean...

00:12:43.737 --> 00:12:47.453
not just general iffiness.

00:12:47.453 --> 00:12:49.650
I mean, I don't know how to cast a spell

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:51.950
to see if someone's a little iffy.

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:54.299
I mean, if there's something crazy happening, sure.

00:12:54.299 --> 00:12:57.240
LAURA: I pull Beau's hand over and start touching her eye

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.810
over to Caleb's eye on his shoulder.

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:01.170
Is it doing anything?

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:02.068
LIAM: Not for me.

00:13:02.068 --> 00:13:04.390
SAM: I'm going to go into our little sack.

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:06.973
I have a little alchemical acid.

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:10.480
With your permission, Caleb,

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.090
can I just sort of try to etch it out,

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:15.903
if it's just on the surface?

00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:19.461
TRAVIS: Yes!

00:13:20.911 --> 00:13:22.352
I'm sorry, I'm just--
MARISHA: You go first.

00:13:22.352 --> 00:13:24.415
SAM: It might hurt. Actually, you know what?

00:13:24.415 --> 00:13:26.640
Maybe I should do it to Beau. It's going to hurt

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.763
and he's not really great with pain.

00:13:32.272 --> 00:13:34.695
MARISHA: I want to go on record and say
I don't think this is going to work.

00:13:34.695 --> 00:13:37.030
And I really would like you to not fuck up my hand.

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:40.773
This is what I do everything with.

00:13:40.773 --> 00:13:42.117
SAM: You're a hand model?
MARISHA: I punch people.

00:13:42.117 --> 00:13:43.092
SAM: Oh, I see. I see.
(laughter)

00:13:43.092 --> 00:13:44.730
TRAVIS: You smash that into things

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:46.651
that nobody else should be smashing their hand into.

00:13:46.651 --> 00:13:47.940
LAURA: Yeah. But if it's hurt, she won't

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:49.181
want to hit things with it.

00:13:49.181 --> 00:13:50.498
She'll try to protect it.
TRAVIS: It's so cool.

00:13:50.498 --> 00:13:52.506
You're going to hold it up, have a big scar

00:13:52.506 --> 00:13:54.455
and people will won't want to fuck with you.

00:13:54.455 --> 00:13:56.995
MARISHA: You can do a tiny portion, a tiny portion.

00:13:56.995 --> 00:13:58.360
SAM: Of course, of course.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.716
ASHLEY: Yeah, but what if this... hold on.

00:14:00.716 --> 00:14:04.464
What is this affects, you know...

00:14:04.464 --> 00:14:06.930
if we have to fight something and you're not fully,

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:08.560
you know, up to par?

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:09.718
MARISHA: I don't know.

00:14:09.718 --> 00:14:11.520
LAURA: Can I try to...

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:14.450
Can I try to heal it?
SAM: Sure.

00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:15.400
LAURA: See what happens?

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:19.233
I'm going to try to cast Greater Restoration on the eye.

00:14:19.233 --> 00:14:20.066
TRAVIS: Whoa.

00:14:20.066 --> 00:14:22.650
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and mark off the cost.

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:25.591
LAURA: Oh, right, wait. Diamond dust.

00:14:25.591 --> 00:14:26.520
TALIESIN: Diamond dust.

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:27.680
LAURA: Okay. Let me make sure I have it.

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.430
I know I have it.

00:14:31.212 --> 00:14:34.320
ASHLEY: In the meantime, I'm going
to grab Beau's hand and just start

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:35.913
just trying to rub it off.

00:14:36.839 --> 00:14:38.189
LAURA: (laughs)
ASHLEY: I know it's not going to do anything--

00:14:38.189 --> 00:14:39.322
LAURA: (clears throat)

00:14:39.322 --> 00:14:41.822
(laughter)

00:14:41.822 --> 00:14:43.318
ASHLEY: Just rub one out real quick.

00:14:43.318 --> 00:14:46.002
SAM: Rub one out real quick. Yeah.

00:14:46.002 --> 00:14:48.519
TRAVIS: I could use both hands. I only need one, though.

00:14:48.519 --> 00:14:49.938
ASHLEY: You can just do it in one hand real fast.

00:14:49.938 --> 00:14:52.110
TRAVIS: (DJ disc scratching sounds)
(laughter)

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:53.559
ASHLEY: Real quick.

00:14:53.559 --> 00:14:54.780
(laughter)

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:56.223
MARISHA: Speed of 50.

00:14:56.223 --> 00:14:58.870
(laughter)

00:14:58.870 --> 00:14:59.703
SAM: Haste.

00:14:59.703 --> 00:15:01.274
LIAM: Honestly don't even need the hands.

00:15:01.274 --> 00:15:03.448
(laughter)

00:15:03.448 --> 00:15:05.390
ASHLEY: [inaudible]

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:08.460
LAURA: I don't have dust. I have residuum

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:10.090
and I have a lot of diamonds.

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:12.143
MATT: Residuum can be used to replace it.

00:15:12.143 --> 00:15:13.417
LAURA: Yeah, I know.

00:15:13.417 --> 00:15:14.995
We don't have any way to just crush these diamonds

00:15:14.995 --> 00:15:16.053
real fast, do we?

00:15:16.939 --> 00:15:18.600
LIAM: I can do it in 10 minutes.

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.500
LAURA: Okay. Yeah. Maybe do that.

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:21.560
SAM: You can crush diamonds?

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:22.712
TRAVIS: Ah, this is great.

00:15:22.712 --> 00:15:23.920
SAM: --with your mind?
MARISHA: (laughs) I know!

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:26.269
TRAVIS: Who's having with fucked up dreams now?
MATT: With his thighs.

00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:28.840
(laughter)

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:30.930
LIAM: With my magic.

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:33.522
LAURA: Here, take one of the 500 gold diamonds

00:15:33.522 --> 00:15:35.390
and turn it into dust.

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:36.419
LIAM: All right. So I will--

00:15:36.419 --> 00:15:39.970
SAM: Will that hinder any other future spells?

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:41.940
LAURA: Well, I've got quite a few diamonds now.

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:43.215
SAM: Okay, okay.

00:15:43.215 --> 00:15:45.390
MATT: Yasha, try as you might,

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:47.090
you can feel the change,

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:49.530
or lack of texture that begins across the surface

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:50.670
of where the eye is placed.

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:54.230
As you rub and rub it's not reacting at all to the contact.

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:56.683
The skin's heating up around it,

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:00.010
but there is no friction heat generated

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:02.183
where the actual eye is on the hand.

00:16:04.644 --> 00:16:05.477
MARISHA: Oh.

00:16:05.477 --> 00:16:06.957
SAM: Should I try some acid?

00:16:06.957 --> 00:16:07.965
MARISHA: Well, let's--

00:16:07.965 --> 00:16:10.231
one thing at a time. Yeah?

00:16:10.231 --> 00:16:12.400
LAURA: Yeah. Let's wait a few minutes so Caleb can do--

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:13.890
Oh my god. What if you can't do spells

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:15.210
now that you have the eye?

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:16.480
LIAM: Well, that's a good test.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.600
LAURA: What if it cancels all the spells like

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:21.069
Lucien's stuff does? Oh no.

00:16:21.069 --> 00:16:23.018
LIAM: I lay out a bit of cloth and spend the next

00:16:23.018 --> 00:16:25.500
several minutes casting Fabricate,

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:29.810
which can change the shape of it into a fine powder.

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:32.720
MATT: You watch as he places out

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:37.160
the specific required ritual structure, takes the diamond,

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:40.934
sets it down in the center, and as he begins to weave,

00:16:42.159 --> 00:16:43.222
the spell is unabated.

00:16:43.222 --> 00:16:47.580
And you watch as it crumbles and transitions into dust.

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:50.458
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to gather up, you know...

00:16:50.458 --> 00:16:52.020
I'm going to separate into little fifths.

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:54.925
So I have 100 gold piles and I'm going to use one

00:16:54.925 --> 00:16:56.762
to do Greater Restoration.

00:16:56.762 --> 00:16:57.812
MATT: Okay.

00:16:58.729 --> 00:17:00.787
You watch as the dust burns away,

00:17:00.787 --> 00:17:03.800
and as it burns away with the faint

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:07.480
greenish-blue tint, the flames surround her hand

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:08.770
and as she reaches out and touches you,

00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:12.593
the flame transitions and blows across your chest and arm.

00:17:14.617 --> 00:17:15.926
The eye remains.

00:17:15.926 --> 00:17:17.453
TRAVIS: Whoa.
LAURA: Fuck. Fuck!

00:17:17.453 --> 00:17:19.160
TRAVIS: Whoa!

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.026
That was the big fix we had, and it didn't work!

00:17:22.026 --> 00:17:27.026
(laughter)

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:28.653
TRAVIS: Shit's real now.

00:17:30.631 --> 00:17:33.470
We just cut hand off, what do you think?

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:34.303
TALIESIN: Want to take a--

00:17:34.303 --> 00:17:36.150
LAURA: Well, we can't cut Caleb's shoulder off.

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:38.803
SAM: I will acid it. I'll acid it.

00:17:38.803 --> 00:17:40.500
MARISHA: This isn't--
LAURA: It's in this--

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:41.333
MARISHA: --going to work.

00:17:41.333 --> 00:17:42.862
But maybe it'll be a cool scar.

00:17:42.862 --> 00:17:44.390
Just--

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:47.050
SAM: Okay. Take a little acid--
TRAVIS: Little drop.

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:49.127
SAM: --pour it on a little cloth. I don't know.

00:17:49.127 --> 00:17:51.525
Is that going to eat the cloth?
I'm a scientist, I know how this works.

00:17:51.525 --> 00:17:52.960
TRAVIS: Dropper.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:54.659
MATT: Cloth isn't your friend in this, necessarily.

00:17:54.659 --> 00:17:56.033
SAM: All right. Forget the cloth.

00:17:56.033 --> 00:17:57.770
(laughter)

00:17:57.770 --> 00:18:00.167
SAM: I dribble the acid right just a little bit

00:18:00.167 --> 00:18:01.770
onto the--

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:04.630
oh, do you need something to bite down on?

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:06.925
What is that?
MARISHA: I don't know.

00:18:06.925 --> 00:18:08.450
TRAVIS: Ow, ow!

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:09.758
MARISHA: Sorry, Fjord, sorry!

00:18:09.758 --> 00:18:11.020
(laughter)

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:13.210
TRAVIS: Fuck!
SAM: Here, take a crossbow bolt.

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:14.043
MARISHA: Okay.

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:16.332
SAM: We'll heal you later.

00:18:16.332 --> 00:18:17.165
(laughter)

00:18:17.165 --> 00:18:18.430
MATT: You drop a little bit onto the eye?

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:19.263
SAM: Yes.

00:18:19.263 --> 00:18:20.096
MATT: Okay.

00:18:21.013 --> 00:18:24.087
Lands in the eye and you wince.

00:18:24.087 --> 00:18:25.554
LIAM: (high-pitched voice) Help me.

00:18:25.554 --> 00:18:27.095
MARISHA: (pained) Not too bad, actually.

00:18:27.095 --> 00:18:28.250
MATT: It's not burning.

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:29.983
LAURA: It's not burning?
MARISHA: What do you mean it's not burning?

00:18:29.983 --> 00:18:31.572
It's not burning through?
MATT: It's just resting on the eye.

00:18:31.572 --> 00:18:32.571
LAURA: (gasps)
LIAM: Ohhh.

00:18:32.571 --> 00:18:33.596
SAM: Oh, like a...

00:18:33.596 --> 00:18:35.549
MARISHA: Like a little mercury puddle?

00:18:35.549 --> 00:18:36.774
MATT: Yeah.
SAM: Like, a little mercury bubble?

00:18:36.774 --> 00:18:39.733
LAURA: Oh god, it won't even burn away.

00:18:39.733 --> 00:18:40.924
It's protected.
SAM: Whoa.

00:18:40.924 --> 00:18:43.058
It's, like, invincible?
TRAVIS: Oh, y'all are fucked!

00:18:43.058 --> 00:18:44.341
MARISHA: Oh no!

00:18:44.341 --> 00:18:45.875
TRAVIS: We got to kill Dracula to make that shit go away.

00:18:45.875 --> 00:18:48.960
LAURA: Ooh, so if we attack Lucien,
don't aim for the eyes.

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:51.810
SAM: I mean, can you just pour it back into my vial?

00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:53.847
MARISHA: Yeah. I mean, can--

00:18:55.947 --> 00:18:57.430
MATT: Roll a dexterity check.

00:18:57.430 --> 00:19:00.521
(laughter)

00:19:00.521 --> 00:19:02.037
SAM: (screams)

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:04.676
MATT: Don't roll a one.

00:19:04.676 --> 00:19:05.648
Don't roll a one!

00:19:05.648 --> 00:19:06.600
MARISHA: It's a straight dex check?

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:07.433
MATT: Yeah.

00:19:07.433 --> 00:19:09.710
MARISHA: Okay. Yeah. 16.

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:10.543
MATT: 16. All right.

00:19:10.543 --> 00:19:12.150
It does (sizzle) a little bit on the side.

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:15.380
And once it drifts off the eye it begins to burn the skin.

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:16.440
You get some back in the vial.

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:17.910
Some of it just spills off and you pull away

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:19.930
and it hits the ground and it burns for a second,

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:21.900
but you quickly neutralize it with whatever

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:22.733
you have available to neutral--

00:19:22.733 --> 00:19:23.920
If you have anything to neutralize acid

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:26.130
or it's just you screaming for the 10 minutes.
TRAVIS: Urine.

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:26.963
SAM: Nope.

00:19:26.963 --> 00:19:28.246
MATT: Nope. All right.
SAM: I have alcohol.

00:19:28.246 --> 00:19:29.079
MARISHA: Uh-uh.

00:19:29.079 --> 00:19:30.641
MATT: Okay. It's going to burn for a while.

00:19:30.641 --> 00:19:32.930
MARISHA: (groans) Okay.

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:34.400
SAM: I have oil. I don't know.

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.210
I should probably learn some chemistry.

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:37.850
MATT: You should probably have some base

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:39.198
if you're going to be carrying around vials of acid

00:19:39.198 --> 00:19:40.188
and play with it.

00:19:40.188 --> 00:19:42.582
SAM: Yeah. I'll get that next campaign.

00:19:42.582 --> 00:19:45.120
(laughter)

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:47.300
TALIESIN: We do have our daily Hail Marys

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:48.307
if we want to try that.

00:19:48.307 --> 00:19:51.880
LAURA: We can try but we haven't taken a long rest yet.

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:53.270
TALIESIN: Are we still not long rested?

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:54.236
MARISHA: Yeah. What time is it?

00:19:54.236 --> 00:19:56.620
MATT: No. This has not been a full long rest yet.

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:57.656
TALIESIN: Oh, okay.

00:19:57.656 --> 00:19:59.031
LAURA: We're going to have to go sleep again.

00:19:59.031 --> 00:19:59.864
TALIESIN: Oh, in that case.

00:19:59.864 --> 00:20:02.940
LIAM: Wee hours of the morning or night?

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:05.705
Because there were-- some time passed, right?

00:20:05.705 --> 00:20:08.598
MATT: Some time has passed, yeah. And you do have Keen Mind.

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:13.434
Which in this circumstance, sure.

00:20:13.434 --> 00:20:16.690
LIAM: And also, clocks in every room that mark--
MATT: That's true.

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:18.750
LIAM: -- the passing of time outside where we are.

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:20.239
MATT: I'll allow it, I'll allow it.

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:25.117
I would say it's about 3:30 in the morning at this point.

00:20:25.117 --> 00:20:26.492
And you went to bed...
LAURA: Of course it is.

00:20:26.492 --> 00:20:27.825
That's when possessions happen.

00:20:27.825 --> 00:20:29.341
MARISHA: True.
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:20:29.341 --> 00:20:30.174
LAURA: Sorry.

00:20:31.267 --> 00:20:33.300
TALIESIN: Just out of idle curiosity,

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:36.170
I'm going to try and cast Blindness on the eye

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:37.688
and not on Beau.

00:20:37.688 --> 00:20:38.600
SAM: Good. Clever.

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:39.951
LAURA: What are you casting?

00:20:39.951 --> 00:20:41.098
TRAVIS: Casting Blindness.
LAURA: Oh.

00:20:41.098 --> 00:20:42.800
TALIESIN: To see if it'll take a spell or not.

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.170
Like, I should be able to tell the difference

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:45.253
between a spell hitting and--

00:20:45.253 --> 00:20:46.878
TRAVIS: You're going to blind Beau.
MARISHA: I know.

00:20:46.878 --> 00:20:49.033
All this testing.

00:20:49.033 --> 00:20:50.030
TALIESIN: I'm not telling you, either.
MARISHA: Human testing.

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:50.863
MATT: Right. Okay.

00:20:52.581 --> 00:20:56.455
It is unable to grasp

00:20:56.455 --> 00:20:57.722
in the way this spell is designed.

00:20:57.722 --> 00:21:00.200
It reaches for the vision center of an individual.

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:03.820
Since you are not focusing on her vision center,

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:06.743
the spell just has no target and dissipates.

00:21:08.002 --> 00:21:09.938
TALIESIN: Nevermind. I was going to say

00:21:09.938 --> 00:21:11.246
if I'm really not concentrating,

00:21:11.246 --> 00:21:13.137
I would have that moment of "it didn't wor-- oh, sorry."

00:21:13.137 --> 00:21:15.560
MATT: Right, right. Fair enough. Good looking out.

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:18.151
LIAM: I mean, we would throw all the spaghetti at the wall.

00:21:18.151 --> 00:21:19.435
That's Vax.

00:21:19.435 --> 00:21:24.192
I will try Identify on Beau's hand.

00:21:24.192 --> 00:21:25.758
MARISHA: You want to Identify?
LAURA: It's because it's hard for you--

00:21:25.758 --> 00:21:26.924
LIAM: Yeah. It's hard, you know.

00:21:26.924 --> 00:21:28.657
I need both hands to do stuff.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, ten minutes like this.

00:21:28.657 --> 00:21:29.774
LIAM: I can't do this.

00:21:29.774 --> 00:21:30.607
LAURA: Cramp in your neck.

00:21:30.607 --> 00:21:31.810
TALIESIN: I would advise against that.

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:34.260
You might discover where it's been, and god only knows.

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:35.430
Sorry. Carry on.

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:38.080
MARISHA: Does anyone want to do my nails while we're just

00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:40.520
doing everything?

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:42.010
TALIESIN: Does any one have a file? Yeah.

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:43.630
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: Thanks.

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:45.773
LAURA: Take my paints out and I'll paint your nails.
ASHLEY: You're probably better.

00:21:45.773 --> 00:21:48.377
LAURA: Should I paint them red to match the eye?

00:21:48.377 --> 00:21:49.792
ASHLEY: Maybe make it disappear?

00:21:49.792 --> 00:21:50.625
MARISHA: It's kind of cool.

00:21:50.625 --> 00:21:52.170
SAM: Can you paint them with the magical paint?

00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:54.820
LAURA: I know, I thought about that, but I've noticed--

00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:57.959
you know, remember when I tried to paint a door in--

00:21:57.959 --> 00:21:59.640
Where were we?

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:00.790
It was real magical.

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:01.810
It didn't work.

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:04.680
I have a feeling this is beyond the paint's capabilities.

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:06.269
I could try.

00:22:06.269 --> 00:22:08.000
TRAVIS: Paint off the tips of her fingers.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.480
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah.

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:12.374
TALIESIN: I hate to even say this.

00:22:12.374 --> 00:22:14.615
Not to suggest this, but worst case scenario,

00:22:14.615 --> 00:22:15.920
we could always try and...

00:22:16.979 --> 00:22:17.812
LAURA: Cut it off?

00:22:17.812 --> 00:22:19.030
TALIESIN: And then grow it back.

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:20.213
LAURA: I mean, I do have--
SAM: What?!

00:22:20.213 --> 00:22:21.400
LAURA: That's true.

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:23.695
TALIESIN: Either of us could pull that off.
SAM: How do you grow it back?

00:22:23.695 --> 00:22:24.653
TRAVIS: Let's be honest,

00:22:24.653 --> 00:22:26.880
we know what's going to happen if we do that.

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:28.480
It's going to grow back with a red eye.

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:29.650
SAM: I don't know. Maybe it won't.

00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:31.670
That's actually kind of brilliant.

00:22:31.670 --> 00:22:33.230
LIAM: No one's cutting off my arm.
TRAVIS: Yasha?

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:35.096
SAM: Well, not your arm. We can start with Beau.

00:22:35.096 --> 00:22:36.041
LAURA: I mean, here's the thing.

00:22:36.041 --> 00:22:38.399
I feel like it's not based in her hand, you know?

00:22:38.399 --> 00:22:40.690
She had a dream, they had dreams.

00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:41.523
TALIESIN: I agree.
LAURA: They had dreams.

00:22:41.523 --> 00:22:42.506
It's in their brain.

00:22:42.506 --> 00:22:44.580
The only solution is to cut their heads off at this point.

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:45.463
TRAVIS: Yeah, dreams.

00:22:45.463 --> 00:22:46.904
Nothing but bad stuff happens from dreams.

00:22:46.904 --> 00:22:49.710
SAM: I'm just saying, it would be pretty amazing experiment

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:51.520
if we just tried it.

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:52.862
TALIESIN: I would need to do it tomorrow.

00:22:52.862 --> 00:22:53.695
LAURA: Shake your hand.

00:22:53.695 --> 00:22:55.980
It will help dry it off.
LIAM: You want to hack off Beauregard hand?

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:58.880
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm not consenting to any of that.

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:00.560
MATT: Caleb, did you cast Identify?

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:02.210
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, on Beauregard's hand.

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:04.220
MATT: Right. As soon as you release the spell,

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:06.849
usually what it does is it gives this faint

00:23:06.849 --> 00:23:11.256
coloration based on the aura and the structure

00:23:11.256 --> 00:23:15.150
of the school of magic that might've
enchanted the object scenario.

00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:18.825
You release the spell and in a brief second,

00:23:18.825 --> 00:23:22.029
akin to when Gandalf reaches for the ring,

00:23:23.204 --> 00:23:25.510
you see the red eye for a second and that's it.

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:27.090
No information.

00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:30.830
You just have a flashback to the dream you just had

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:32.230
and nothing more.

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:35.510
LIAM: Okay. So that's not going to work.

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:37.718
TRAVIS: What's not going to work?

00:23:37.718 --> 00:23:41.346
LIAM: I tried to understand what it is.

00:23:41.346 --> 00:23:43.188
Your cuticles are a mess, by the way.

00:23:46.773 --> 00:23:48.994
MARISHA: I'm in the fucking tundra. Fuck you, man.

00:23:50.094 --> 00:23:51.386
LIAM: You moisturize?

00:23:52.397 --> 00:23:54.497
ASHLEY: Do you?
LAURA: Is this what the eyes do?

00:23:54.497 --> 00:23:57.090
Makes you see every little detail about that person?

00:23:57.972 --> 00:23:59.197
LIAM: I already had that.

00:24:00.793 --> 00:24:02.651
MARISHA: So what did you see other than, like,

00:24:02.651 --> 00:24:04.700
busted-ass cuticles?

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:09.668
LIAM: I saw the big eye from your dream

00:24:09.668 --> 00:24:11.217
for a split second.

00:24:13.868 --> 00:24:15.593
Waiting for the other shoe to drop here.

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:20.483
MARISHA: You think we'll be able to get sleep again, ever?

00:24:21.718 --> 00:24:22.551
LIAM: That's interesting.

00:24:22.551 --> 00:24:25.264
LAURA: Oh no, that's why he doesn't sleep.

00:24:25.264 --> 00:24:27.131
He probably sees it all the time.

00:24:30.108 --> 00:24:31.360
SAM: Well, we should go back to sleep

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:33.231
and finish our long rest, anyway.

00:24:33.231 --> 00:24:37.340
Tomorrow won't be a problem for Caleb, but, Beau,

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:40.140
do you think maybe you should wrap that thing up?

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:42.420
MARISHA: I don't want him to know at all.

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:44.650
LAURA: What if-- he probably already knows.

00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:46.230
He's probably aware it's happened.

00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:47.648
MARISHA: He absolutely knows.

00:24:47.648 --> 00:24:48.961
TALIESIN: He probably can see through it.

00:24:50.241 --> 00:24:55.172
MARISHA: Oh, my-- shit. You're right.

00:24:55.172 --> 00:24:57.240
No, that's confirmed because we've seen that

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.930
with the others, right? That he can see through these eyes.

00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:02.520
LAURA: He can? He can see through them?

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:04.753
Oh my god. What if he tries to take control of them

00:25:04.753 --> 00:25:06.785
and he takes control of you two as well?

00:25:06.785 --> 00:25:08.940
TRAVIS: I don't know if he sees through those eyes

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:11.210
or if something is seeing through those eyes.

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:12.629
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:25:12.629 --> 00:25:15.245
SAM: Well, what if you guys start speaking in unison

00:25:15.245 --> 00:25:18.252
in that creepy way that he does sometimes?

00:25:18.252 --> 00:25:19.292
LIAM: It'll never happen.

00:25:19.292 --> 00:25:21.070
MARISHA: What am I thinking right now?

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:23.062
LIAM: You want to hit me in the nose.

00:25:23.062 --> 00:25:26.164
MARISHA: No. I was thinking about waffles.

00:25:26.164 --> 00:25:27.480
SAM: (laughs)

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:30.268
MARISHA: Now I kind of want to hit you in the nose.

00:25:30.268 --> 00:25:32.193
Yeah, waffles sounds great. Yeah.

00:25:32.193 --> 00:25:34.453
LIAM: (bell dinging)
MATT: (meows)

00:25:34.453 --> 00:25:35.434
TALIESIN: Get some sleep.

00:25:35.434 --> 00:25:38.648
LIAM: Gisela, go up and get--
bring down two plates of waffles.

00:25:38.648 --> 00:25:40.840
MATT: (meows affirmatively)

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.560
SAM: Beauregard, if you need a glove,

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:44.900
I have some gloves that you could borrow.

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:46.340
Do you have some?

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:48.306
MARISHA: I've got gloves, yeah.

00:25:48.306 --> 00:25:50.372
I've got my bracers, my wraps

00:25:50.372 --> 00:25:52.450
because, you know, I got to protect the wrists

00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:55.065
so I do the wraps. Then I do the bracers, and then I do

00:25:55.065 --> 00:25:59.622
my lightning gloves on top. So I'm covered.

00:25:59.622 --> 00:26:00.660
SAM: Oh, does it gets sweaty?

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:03.930
MARISHA: Yeah. You should smell it.
Do you want to smell the gloves?

00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:06.293
LAURA: I could smell her hands
when I was painting her nails.

00:26:06.293 --> 00:26:07.843
MATT: Smell the Glove. Great album.

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:10.980
SAM: That's pretty rank.
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:26:14.874 --> 00:26:15.734
TALIESIN: We should sleep.

00:26:15.734 --> 00:26:16.567
TRAVIS: (exhales)

00:26:17.901 --> 00:26:18.907
LAURA: Cats.

00:26:18.907 --> 00:26:20.504
ASHLEY: Oh.
MATT: (meows)

00:26:20.504 --> 00:26:21.923
They come back with waffles.
TRAVIS: Ah!

00:26:21.923 --> 00:26:24.356
(laughter)

00:26:25.409 --> 00:26:26.867
LAURA: Oh no.
MARISHA: Okay.

00:26:28.141 --> 00:26:29.732
LAURA: If you guys--

00:26:29.732 --> 00:26:31.950
Oh no. How are you going to sleep?

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:33.700
TRAVIS: It's going to be great.

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:34.533
MARISHA: Maybe--

00:26:35.428 --> 00:26:38.155
Maybe this is a good thing.

00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:41.253
SAM: Yeah? Go on.

00:26:43.621 --> 00:26:48.040
MARISHA: Maybe we'll get a
little bit more inside information

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:51.200
as we get into this and we'll have a little bit...

00:26:52.506 --> 00:26:54.550
LIAM: Yeah, we get closer to our enemies

00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:58.710
and if we go too far, it is up to you all

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:00.670
to keep us from going over the edge.

00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:02.010
LAURA: What if every time you go to sleep

00:27:02.010 --> 00:27:03.433
you get another eyeball?

00:27:04.465 --> 00:27:06.448
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

00:27:06.448 --> 00:27:08.129
(laughs)

00:27:08.129 --> 00:27:11.249
That would be fucked.

00:27:11.249 --> 00:27:13.167
I'm loving this.

00:27:13.167 --> 00:27:15.487
Oh man.

00:27:15.487 --> 00:27:20.487
TALIESIN: It's technically not a full rest yet, either.

00:27:20.515 --> 00:27:24.630
LIAM: Well, we just have to wait and see.
TRAVIS: Never sleep again.

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:27.780
LIAM: I'm going to go to sleep, is what I'm going to do.

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:29.160
TRAVIS: It's still my watch, right?

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:31.050
MATT: Yeah. It's almost over.

00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:31.883
TALIESIN: Back to sleep.

00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:35.173
MARISHA: I'm going to go to sleep, but I'm going to sleep

00:27:35.173 --> 00:27:39.520
with a pencil in hand on an open page of my notebook.

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.123
MATT: Actually, it was your first watch.

00:27:42.521 --> 00:27:44.240
It would be a little earlier in the morning then

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:46.441
because we never quite finished your first watch.

00:27:46.441 --> 00:27:47.400
TRAVIS: Yeah, I know I was the last.

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:48.233
MATT: Yeah.

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:50.913
LAURA: All right.

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:54.103
TRAVIS: Sweet dreams.

00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:56.143
MARISHA: Beat me to it.

00:27:57.505 --> 00:27:58.338
MATT: Okay.

00:27:58.338 --> 00:28:00.540
MARISHA: I'll try to go back to sleep.
LAURA: I'll take second watch.

00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:01.373
MATT: All right.

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:03.490
Who's taking third?

00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:05.150
ASHLEY: I'll take third.

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:08.610
MATT: Okay. Roll perception check for second watch.

00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:11.130
Your watch finishes without issue.

00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:12.398
LAURA: Without--
MATT: Additional issues.

00:28:12.398 --> 00:28:14.181
TRAVIS: I was going to say, according to what?

00:28:16.985 --> 00:28:18.930
LIAM: What did you do, Travis? What did you do?

00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:20.280
TRAVIS: Boy.

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:21.120
LAURA: Eight.

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:22.570
MATT: Eight. Okay.
TRAVIS: Not enough.

00:28:25.009 --> 00:28:26.630
MATT: Nothing catches your attention.

00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:28.726
You push through the boredom and then
eventually finish your watch.

00:28:28.726 --> 00:28:30.524
LAURA: (tongue lolling) (snoring)

00:28:30.524 --> 00:28:32.542
MATT: You're taking the last watch, you said?
ASHLEY: I'll take the last watch.

00:28:32.542 --> 00:28:33.990
MATT: Go ahead and roll a perception check for me.

00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:35.077
TRAVIS: Come on, Yasha.

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:38.180
ASHLEY: Okay.
TRAVIS: It comes down to you.

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:40.993
ASHLEY: 16.

00:28:42.851 --> 00:28:44.117
LIAM: Oh boy.

00:28:45.155 --> 00:28:47.409
ASHLEY: (laughs)

00:28:47.409 --> 00:28:49.847
MARISHA: Oh boy. Oh no.

00:28:49.847 --> 00:28:53.233
(laughter)

00:28:53.233 --> 00:28:55.242
TRAVIS: It's a special angle.

00:28:55.242 --> 00:28:57.405
ASHLEY: It's a very special angle.

00:28:57.405 --> 00:28:59.988
LIAM: It's a good color, too.
It just, like, draws your eyes.

00:28:59.988 --> 00:29:01.674
TRAVIS: Just like in Tossman's, man.

00:29:01.674 --> 00:29:04.250
(laughter)

00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:07.540
MATT: I'm just glad other people are
getting in the beam of focus now.

00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:09.510
Years of this shit, I'm just like, "Yeah.

00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:10.687
"Yeah, how's it feel?"

00:29:13.121 --> 00:29:13.954
ASHLEY: Yeah, 16.

00:29:13.954 --> 00:29:17.070
MATT: 16. Other than some general restlessness--

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:17.903
ASHLEY: Sorry, 15.

00:29:17.903 --> 00:29:19.653
MATT: 15. Oh, well, that changes everything.

00:29:19.653 --> 00:29:22.070
ASHLEY: Well, I figured.
MATT: No, good.

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:24.003
No, your watch finishes without issue.

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.970
You do manage to finish a full night's sleep.

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:31.940
You both as well, though not the most restful,

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:33.630
given the circumstances in which you had to

00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:36.960
force yourselves back into a semblance of slumber.

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:38.703
No continuation of the dream.

00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:41.550
You do manage to complete a long rest

00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:43.552
and all of you come to consciousness.

00:29:43.552 --> 00:29:44.385
MARISHA: Oh, okay.

00:29:44.385 --> 00:29:45.218
MATT: A little tense,

00:29:46.279 --> 00:29:49.860
but rested.

00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:52.124
LIAM: And everyone except for Veth and Caleb

00:29:52.124 --> 00:29:53.670
have the one point of exhaustion, right?

00:29:53.670 --> 00:29:54.837
MATT: Correct.
TALIESIN: And Beau.

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:57.438
SAM: No, not Beau.

00:29:57.438 --> 00:30:00.790
TALIESIN: Did a-- cast a spell, restoration.

00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:02.238
MATT: That's true. Yeah.

00:30:02.238 --> 00:30:03.415
You would not get--

00:30:03.415 --> 00:30:05.924
MARISHA: Wasn't a total waste. That's good.

00:30:05.924 --> 00:30:07.616
TALIESIN: [inaudible]. This is so scary.

00:30:07.616 --> 00:30:09.160
MATT: No, I mean, you always need one.

00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:15.054
ASHLEY: We have one level of exhaustion? Okay.

00:30:15.054 --> 00:30:16.840
LAURA: I always forget where it's at.

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:18.172
TRAVIS: It's under--
SAM: Conditions.

00:30:18.172 --> 00:30:20.260
MARISHA: At the very bottom.
TRAVIS: Right under your hit points.

00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:22.743
TALIESIN: Mine's at the top right, by hit points.

00:30:22.743 --> 00:30:25.268
ASHLEY: By armor class?
LAURA: Oh, conditions. Yes, yes, yes.

00:30:25.268 --> 00:30:26.459
SAM: Really?

00:30:32.815 --> 00:30:35.866
ASHLEY: Any dreams? Anything? You're okay?

00:30:35.866 --> 00:30:36.873
MARISHA: Not a lot of sleep,

00:30:36.873 --> 00:30:39.626
but not a lot of dreams either.

00:30:43.804 --> 00:30:45.140
TALIESIN: No new eyes?

00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:48.160
LAURA: I know. I'm looking at the back of Caleb's neck.

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:49.285
MARISHA: Anyhing new?

00:30:49.285 --> 00:30:50.532
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:30:50.532 --> 00:30:53.501
TRAVIS: Oh, holy shit. Come on.

00:30:53.501 --> 00:30:56.130
LAURA: I'm looking at his hands and the back of his neck,

00:30:56.130 --> 00:30:58.060
all the places.
MATT: Perception check.

00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:00.020
TRAVIS: What if it's a fucking timer?

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:01.480
We got to move fast, I bet.

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:04.360
MARISHA: 11, it's not good.

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:07.904
MATT: You don't see any changes or additions.
LAURA: 16.

00:31:07.904 --> 00:31:09.270
TALIESIN: Check your back really quickly,

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:10.827
if that's okay.
LAURA: 16.

00:31:10.827 --> 00:31:11.718
MATT: 16?

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:15.287
You don't see anything different beyond what

00:31:15.287 --> 00:31:17.300
you were shown in the middle of the evening.

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:18.650
TRAVIS: Check his scalp, like a--

00:31:19.905 --> 00:31:21.330
TALIESIN: Looks fine.

00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:23.763
MATT: No difference?

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.850
TRAVIS: What about the roof of his mouth? Check his taint.

00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:30.208
(laughter)

00:31:30.208 --> 00:31:32.760
LAURA: I'm nervous every time.

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:34.988
Maybe you have to look at the book again.

00:31:34.988 --> 00:31:37.954
LIAM: We've known each other for a long time, all of us.

00:31:37.954 --> 00:31:42.608
(laughter)

00:31:42.608 --> 00:31:44.607
TRAVIS: It's what friends do. Show me!

00:31:44.607 --> 00:31:45.690
(laughter)

00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:47.260
LIAM: Show me what you got!

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:49.927
(laughter)

00:31:51.431 --> 00:31:52.264
TALIESIN: Well.

00:31:52.264 --> 00:31:54.131
TRAVIS: Sun it for a little bit.

00:31:54.131 --> 00:31:56.660
TALIESIN: Just for-- what do you say?

00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:59.910
Get rid of the eyes or close down the--?

00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:04.730
LAURA: We can try again today for different things.

00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:08.005
I would still, again, try to bring Molly back into the body.

00:32:11.373 --> 00:32:13.190
SAM: This is Divine Intervention?

00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:14.352
LAURA: I mean, if I'm going to ask for something

00:32:14.352 --> 00:32:16.144
I'm going to ask for something amazing.

00:32:16.144 --> 00:32:19.618
TALIESIN: Well, I will say that

00:32:19.618 --> 00:32:22.165
the way, at least, the magic works for me is,

00:32:23.665 --> 00:32:26.470
it's got to be a conceivable way for it to happen.

00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:28.150
You can't quite--

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:28.983
LAURA: Oh, really?

00:32:28.983 --> 00:32:30.363
TALIESIN: Yeah. It's not a wish.

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:32.160
TALIESIN: It's more of a...

00:32:33.530 --> 00:32:34.990
LAURA: That you got to be able to do it?

00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:37.480
So it's something that Artagan actually

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:38.530
has to be able to do?

00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:42.660
TALIESIN: It can be impressive, but--

00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:47.510
So there's an entire possibility that could

00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:50.053
try and remove the eyes and it could not work.

00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:54.998
LAURA: Okay.

00:32:54.998 --> 00:32:56.013
Okay.

00:32:57.580 --> 00:32:58.610
TRAVIS: Are you going to do it?

00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:00.219
TALIESIN: Temple or eyes?

00:33:00.219 --> 00:33:04.093
LAURA: I'm going to try to get him to

00:33:04.093 --> 00:33:06.368
immediately bamf us to Essek.

00:33:09.136 --> 00:33:12.518
TRAVIS: Yeah? Is that what we want to do?

00:33:12.518 --> 00:33:14.800
LAURA: (laughs)

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:16.367
That's what I want to do.

00:33:16.367 --> 00:33:19.710
TALIESIN: We don't know if-- will divine teleportation

00:33:19.710 --> 00:33:22.145
be a problem?

00:33:22.145 --> 00:33:23.403
LAURA: What? Is that bad?

00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:26.469
LIAM: Well,

00:33:27.736 --> 00:33:31.932
we talked about either

00:33:31.932 --> 00:33:33.690
murdering them now--

00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:34.747
SAM: Or staying with them.

00:33:34.747 --> 00:33:37.347
LIAM: 'Til morning. Or staying with them to the very end.

00:33:38.411 --> 00:33:41.919
And if we go to Essek now they could skedaddle

00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:45.995
right off of this mortal coil to their destination.

00:33:45.995 --> 00:33:47.073
LAURA: Oh, you're right.

00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:50.480
LIAM: What about you reverse that?

00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:53.570
LAURA: Bring Essek here?
SAM: Bring Essek to us.

00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:54.403
LAURA: Right away?

00:33:55.702 --> 00:33:56.985
SAM: Yeah.
LIAM: Well, I'd rather that

00:33:56.985 --> 00:34:01.193
than the opposite. I don't want to lose them.

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:09.490
SAM: Yeah. That makes sense. That makes a lot of sense.

00:34:09.490 --> 00:34:11.406
TALIESIN: I'm going to go for closing the site,

00:34:11.406 --> 00:34:13.118
the secret entrance.

00:34:13.118 --> 00:34:14.140
SAM: Cool.

00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:15.190
TALIESIN: See what that does.

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:18.780
Nope.

00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:19.870
LAURA: I'm going to go for

00:34:19.870 --> 00:34:22.280
trying to make all of their relics disappear

00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:24.623
immediately.

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:27.512
SAM: Their relics?
MARISHA: That's kind of cool.

00:34:27.512 --> 00:34:28.670
LAURA: All of their threshold crests,

00:34:28.670 --> 00:34:30.280
all of the things they need.

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:33.030
I want the Traveler to steal them all.

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:34.180
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: I like that.

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:36.971
LAURA: Nope.

00:34:36.971 --> 00:34:38.953
(laughter)

00:34:38.953 --> 00:34:40.569
TALIESIN: It's good to remember that we can do this, though.

00:34:40.569 --> 00:34:41.402
LAURA: Yeah.

00:34:41.402 --> 00:34:44.194
LIAM: Is it once a day?
LAURA: Every day we can try for something really stupid.

00:34:44.194 --> 00:34:45.027
TALIESIN: Until it works.
LIAM: Right.

00:34:45.027 --> 00:34:46.735
TALIESIN: And then you have to take a week off.

00:34:46.735 --> 00:34:49.100
LIAM: Got it. Cool.

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:51.225
LAURA: But hey, if you're listening,

00:34:51.225 --> 00:34:53.017
you know, you could try that anytime you want.

00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:54.970
You could try it.

00:34:54.970 --> 00:34:55.886
TRAVIS: Who are you talking to?

00:34:55.886 --> 00:34:57.234
LAURA: I'm talking to the Traveler.

00:34:57.234 --> 00:34:58.267
TRAVIS: Oh, right, yep.

00:34:58.267 --> 00:34:59.525
You mean Artagan?

00:34:59.525 --> 00:35:00.483
LAURA: Yeah.

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:04.375
TALIESIN: Well.

00:35:04.375 --> 00:35:06.170
LIAM: We're going to have to face the music at some point.

00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:08.610
Should I invite them to breakfast?

00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:09.793
SAM: Yes.
TALIESIN: I think it's time for waffles.

00:35:09.793 --> 00:35:10.626
LAURA: Sure.

00:35:10.626 --> 00:35:12.484
LIAM: Okay. Pull out a copper wire

00:35:12.484 --> 00:35:14.808
and will deliver to Lucien:

00:35:14.808 --> 00:35:16.470
You might be able to hear me without this,

00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:18.823
but breakfast will be in 20 minutes.

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:23.473
MATT: Brief moment and then a response.

00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:26.993
"All right, then. See you there."

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:33.750
TRAVIS: I, for one, am very excited.

00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:37.591
This is unexpected development.

00:35:37.591 --> 00:35:39.551
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

00:35:39.551 --> 00:35:41.710
SAM: We're just acting like everything's fine, yeah?

00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:43.583
TRAVIS: Yeah.
LIAM: Well, <i>ja</i>.

00:35:43.583 --> 00:35:45.553
LAURA: You're not going to look at the book anymore, right?

00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:48.860
Caleb, you can't look at the book anymore.

00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:52.168
TRAVIS: Ooh boy, that seems like a given, but--

00:35:53.677 --> 00:35:56.000
LIAM: Yeah, that makes sense.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.223
LAURA: Caleb, you'll get possessed.
TALIESIN: That's a maybe.

00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:05.140
LIAM: Not necessarily, but I don't have to look at the book.

00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:07.480
I don't have to look at the book.

00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:10.373
ASHLEY: Yeah, but what if it gives you more information?

00:36:12.535 --> 00:36:16.783
LIAM: This is the razor's edge one can walk on.

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:19.978
Stay away from it completely--
ASHLEY: What if we all just looked at it a little bit?

00:36:19.978 --> 00:36:21.219
LIAM: -- or get even closer?

00:36:21.219 --> 00:36:22.885
TRAVIS: (laughs)

00:36:22.885 --> 00:36:26.259
We just tank the whole campaign right here.

00:36:26.259 --> 00:36:27.636
Let's all go ahead.
ASHLEY: We can all just

00:36:27.636 --> 00:36:29.879
look at it for a little bit amount of time

00:36:29.879 --> 00:36:34.048
and then we would have information.

00:36:34.048 --> 00:36:35.410
It's a bad idea. It's a bad idea.

00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:36.330
I know it's a bad idea,

00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:37.840
so I'm not going to continue.

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:39.810
TRAVIS: What if it's, like, a slowly spreading disease

00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:42.170
and as we rest tonight, there will be another eye,

00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:43.153
and then another?
LIAM: I would say--

00:36:43.153 --> 00:36:44.428
TALIESIN: Then you re-read the book.

00:36:44.428 --> 00:36:45.400
LIAM: -- for now--

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:46.772
ASHLEY: Yeah. Then you would read the book because you--

00:36:46.772 --> 00:36:47.605
LIAM: -- we do nothing.

00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:50.235
LIAM: We just give it 24 hours,

00:36:50.235 --> 00:36:52.982
we sleep on it.
TRAVIS: I am here for that plan.

00:36:52.982 --> 00:36:54.913
ASHLEY: (sighs)

00:36:54.913 --> 00:36:55.996
LIAM: Do you think?

00:36:55.996 --> 00:36:56.829
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:36:58.205 --> 00:37:01.530
I'm glad we're in this together.

00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:03.530
For better or for worse.

00:37:05.324 --> 00:37:08.777
LIAM: We said we would keep each other in check.

00:37:08.777 --> 00:37:11.504
MARISHA: I think that's about--

00:37:11.504 --> 00:37:14.082
Yep, I think that's about to be the thing.

00:37:14.082 --> 00:37:14.915
LIAM: Yeah.

00:37:16.846 --> 00:37:18.462
Look at this.

00:37:18.462 --> 00:37:20.086
Hold your fist up.

00:37:20.086 --> 00:37:21.306
MARISHA: Which one?

00:37:21.306 --> 00:37:22.177
LIAM: The one.

00:37:22.177 --> 00:37:23.978
TRAVIS: (laughs)

00:37:23.978 --> 00:37:27.373
LIAM: I yank down my clothes and I stand next to her,

00:37:27.373 --> 00:37:29.318
and make two eyes look around.

00:37:29.318 --> 00:37:31.607
(laughter)

00:37:31.607 --> 00:37:33.113
LAURA: Wow.

00:37:33.113 --> 00:37:36.122
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait, cross eyes, cross eyes.

00:37:36.122 --> 00:37:37.354
Yeah. (laughs)

00:37:37.354 --> 00:37:38.461
LIAM: Okay, that's actually pretty good.

00:37:38.461 --> 00:37:40.548
I'm going to draw it in my sketchbook.

00:37:40.548 --> 00:37:41.625
TRAVIS: I'm going down to breakfast.

00:37:41.625 --> 00:37:42.478
SAM: I'm coming.

00:37:42.478 --> 00:37:45.428
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah.

00:37:45.428 --> 00:37:47.071
MATT: All right, you guys go

00:37:47.071 --> 00:37:49.248
and make your way down to breakfast.

00:37:49.248 --> 00:37:51.237
You can see the Tomb Takers are already there,

00:37:51.237 --> 00:37:54.404
and have begun diving into their meal.

00:37:55.596 --> 00:37:56.700
As you all step into the chamber

00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:58.387
and take your places around the long table,

00:37:58.387 --> 00:38:00.382
Lucien, halfway into chewing,

00:38:00.382 --> 00:38:02.466
looks up slightly and goes,

00:38:04.282 --> 00:38:05.957
"Everyone sleep well?"

00:38:05.957 --> 00:38:08.199
LAURA: (groaning)
MARISHA: This guy.

00:38:08.199 --> 00:38:09.032
TALIESIN: Middly.

00:38:09.032 --> 00:38:10.171
(laughter)

00:38:10.171 --> 00:38:11.471
TRAVIS: Wondrous world.

00:38:11.471 --> 00:38:12.304
Down!

00:38:13.947 --> 00:38:16.801
MATT: "Good, good, we're so close today.

00:38:16.801 --> 00:38:19.797
"Just a bit more travel, we'll be there."

00:38:19.797 --> 00:38:21.505
TRAVIS: What do you think, a day more, less?

00:38:21.505 --> 00:38:24.469
LIAM: End of the day or tomorrow?

00:38:24.469 --> 00:38:25.608
MATT: "Early tomorrow,

00:38:25.608 --> 00:38:28.750
"should we not run into more terrible weather."

00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:31.929
TRAVIS: Nott. Veth.
ASHLEY: Did you sleep okay?

00:38:31.929 --> 00:38:33.128
LAURA: Yeah, did you have kitty dreams?

00:38:33.128 --> 00:38:35.761
Because sometimes when I roam,

00:38:35.761 --> 00:38:38.178
I have dreams like a cat afterwards.

00:38:39.245 --> 00:38:42.773
MATT: "I had some nice dreams, not too bad.

00:38:42.773 --> 00:38:44.272
"Some good decor.

00:38:44.272 --> 00:38:47.943
"Some fun stories around it.

00:38:47.943 --> 00:38:50.093
"Anyway, come, eat."

00:38:51.262 --> 00:38:52.773
TRAVIS: Om nom nom nom.

00:38:52.773 --> 00:38:56.223
MATT: So you guys have your breakfast.
SAM and ASHLEY: (eating noises)

00:38:56.223 --> 00:38:57.574
MATT: Unless you have anything else to discuss,

00:38:57.574 --> 00:38:58.959
you can go ahead and pick up your things and prepare

00:38:58.959 --> 00:39:02.323
for your hopefully final day's journey on to the ruins.

00:39:02.323 --> 00:39:04.644
SAM: All right, Ashley Johnson.

00:39:04.644 --> 00:39:06.310
TALIESIN: I believe in you.
ASHLEY: I'm the roll?

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:07.227
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah.

00:39:08.951 --> 00:39:10.397
LIAM: Bring that wisdom save power.

00:39:10.397 --> 00:39:11.314
TRAVIS: Let's go.

00:39:15.772 --> 00:39:17.438
ASHLEY: What am I adding?

00:39:17.438 --> 00:39:18.688
MATT: Nothing.

00:39:18.688 --> 00:39:20.104
ASHLEY: Just as-is?
MATT: Yeah.

00:39:20.104 --> 00:39:20.937
ASHLEY: 11.

00:39:21.892 --> 00:39:22.725
SAM: Okay.

00:39:22.725 --> 00:39:23.558
MARISHA: Did you roll a 10?

00:39:23.558 --> 00:39:24.834
LIAM: A 10 was a storm.

00:39:24.834 --> 00:39:25.760
SAM: 10 was bad.
LIAM: Yeah, 10 was bad.

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:27.691
SAM: I think we have eights that are bad.

00:39:27.691 --> 00:39:29.561
MATT: Roll another d8 for me, please.

00:39:29.561 --> 00:39:31.969
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm into it.
SAM: That's no good.

00:39:31.969 --> 00:39:33.375
ASHLEY: Okay.
TRAVIS: Encyclopedia Brown.

00:39:33.375 --> 00:39:38.117
ASHLEY: Use these new ones, I think this is an eight.

00:39:39.858 --> 00:39:41.363
Eight.

00:39:41.363 --> 00:39:42.196
MATT: You rolled an eight?

00:39:42.196 --> 00:39:43.029
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:39:43.029 --> 00:39:44.394
TALIESIN: Oh, oh no.

00:39:44.394 --> 00:39:46.811
TRAVIS: Please, I'm so happy.

00:39:49.783 --> 00:39:51.109
ASHLEY: Oh no, what'd I do?

00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:53.307
SAM: And so ends the story of the Mighty--

00:39:53.307 --> 00:39:55.316
(laughter)

00:39:55.316 --> 00:39:56.435
ASHLEY: Oh no.

00:39:56.435 --> 00:39:57.612
MATT: The day is clear.

00:39:57.612 --> 00:39:59.872
The weather is fine.

00:39:59.872 --> 00:40:02.789
The storm has blown past and you can see the blue sky

00:40:02.789 --> 00:40:05.645
now taking most of the air above you.

00:40:05.645 --> 00:40:08.836
The gray and dark snow

00:40:08.836 --> 00:40:12.076
seems to be pushing further to the west-northwest.

00:40:12.076 --> 00:40:15.541
With that, you gather your things, continue trekking onward.

00:40:15.541 --> 00:40:17.438
About four--

00:40:17.438 --> 00:40:18.271
ASHLEY: Oh boy.

00:40:18.271 --> 00:40:20.771
MATT: -- five hours into the journey,

00:40:24.153 --> 00:40:27.920
you hear this sound, this,

00:40:29.805 --> 00:40:33.654
(grunting) (whimpering).

00:40:33.654 --> 00:40:34.564
And you glance over in the direction

00:40:34.564 --> 00:40:37.688
you can see there's a pack of about seven wolves,

00:40:37.688 --> 00:40:41.172
running to a northern direction.

00:40:42.532 --> 00:40:44.281
TRAVIS and LAURA: Away from something?

00:40:44.281 --> 00:40:45.569
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:40:45.569 --> 00:40:47.382
MATT: They're running just a northern direction.

00:40:47.382 --> 00:40:48.321
TRAVIS: Across our path.

00:40:48.321 --> 00:40:49.476
MATT: Yeah.

00:40:49.476 --> 00:40:50.966
LAURA: What's behind them?

00:40:50.966 --> 00:40:52.351
What's running--

00:40:52.351 --> 00:40:54.033
MATT: Roll a perception check.

00:40:54.033 --> 00:40:55.657
TRAVIS: I'll assist you.
TALIESIN: Can I join in that?

00:40:55.657 --> 00:40:57.157
MATT: You can as well.

00:40:58.588 --> 00:41:03.063
LAURA: Ooh, two very good rolls there.

00:41:03.063 --> 00:41:04.563
LIAM: Doing the cake.

00:41:05.595 --> 00:41:09.707
LAURA: 20, I can add, five plus 18 is 23.

00:41:09.707 --> 00:41:10.861
MATT: 23, okay.
TALIESIN: 24.

00:41:10.861 --> 00:41:12.548
LAURA: Ooh, wow.

00:41:12.548 --> 00:41:13.935
MATT: As you guys follow that for a second,

00:41:13.935 --> 00:41:16.120
you're like, "Where are they rushing from?"

00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:17.563
And you glance up in the sky

00:41:17.563 --> 00:41:20.768
and you see this like glint in the air.

00:41:20.768 --> 00:41:23.393
TALIESIN: I tap Lucien and point.

00:41:27.147 --> 00:41:30.397
TRAVIS: Did we deal with rocs out here?
MATT: "You've got to be kidding me."

00:41:31.369 --> 00:41:32.334
MARISHA: "You got to be kidding me,"

00:41:32.334 --> 00:41:33.675
that what he just said?
MATT: (wings flapping)

00:41:33.675 --> 00:41:35.433
LAURA: Is he smiling? Is he smiling, what is it?

00:41:35.433 --> 00:41:36.661
LIAM: A roc.

00:41:36.661 --> 00:41:38.035
LAURA: Is it a dragon?

00:41:38.035 --> 00:41:43.035
MATT: You see, running in your direction loosely

00:41:43.444 --> 00:41:46.035
the beating wings of a massive white dragon.

00:41:46.035 --> 00:41:49.196
SAM: What?!
TRAVIS: Get the fuck out of here!

00:41:49.196 --> 00:41:50.831
LAURA: A fucking dragon!

00:41:50.831 --> 00:41:52.198
SAM: What?
MATT: What are you doing?

00:41:52.198 --> 00:41:53.994
MARISHA: You rolled a dragon into existence?
ASHLEY: I rolled a dragon.

00:41:53.994 --> 00:41:55.662
(laughter)

00:41:55.662 --> 00:41:56.859
MARISHA: What did you do?!
ASHLEY: I'm sorry!

00:41:56.859 --> 00:41:58.998
MATT: What are you doing, what are you doing?

00:41:58.998 --> 00:42:00.891
LAURA: How far away are we from the tower, really far?

00:42:00.891 --> 00:42:02.962
MATT: It's hard to see it at this distance, like gauging,

00:42:02.962 --> 00:42:04.585
because it's just blue sky and this shape.

00:42:04.585 --> 00:42:06.071
It's small, but it's coming quick.

00:42:06.071 --> 00:42:06.904
What are you doing?

00:42:06.904 --> 00:42:08.900
LAURA: We bury down in the snow.
SAM: Yes, yes.

00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:10.000
MARISHA: Are there some snowbanks

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.011
or is there any outcroppings?
MATT: Oh, no, it's a fresh snow overnight

00:42:12.011 --> 00:42:13.320
So there's snowbanks, definitely.

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:14.680
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, we'll shimmy down.

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:16.997
SAM: How far did we get from the house?

00:42:16.997 --> 00:42:17.947
Can we just run back into the house?
LAURA: That's what I'm saying.

00:42:17.947 --> 00:42:19.009
Is the tower close by?

00:42:19.009 --> 00:42:20.507
MATT: You guys have been traveling for four to five hours.

00:42:20.507 --> 00:42:21.340
SAM: Oh, fuck you.

00:42:21.340 --> 00:42:23.318
MATT: And it only lasts for--

00:42:23.318 --> 00:42:24.175
LAURA: 24 hours.

00:42:24.175 --> 00:42:25.066
MATT: 24, it does last 24 hours.

00:42:25.066 --> 00:42:26.743
TRAVIS: I can do Marine Layer but I think they have--

00:42:26.743 --> 00:42:27.605
they can see through anything, right?

00:42:27.605 --> 00:42:28.826
SAM: True sight, yeah, so we should just

00:42:28.826 --> 00:42:30.779
bury ourselves in the snow.
LAURA: Do the shimmy, shimmy down.

00:42:30.779 --> 00:42:32.450
ASHLEY: Start, yeah.
SAM: Shimmy shimmy shimmy.

00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:33.283
MATT: Okay.

00:42:33.283 --> 00:42:35.224
LAURA: I start wiggling, you know, like.
SAM: Do we have any Dust of whatever, or--?

00:42:35.224 --> 00:42:36.898
TRAVIS: We don't have that shit in this campaign!

00:42:36.898 --> 00:42:37.886
TALIESIN: Stealth.

00:42:37.886 --> 00:42:38.719
LAURA: What?

00:42:38.719 --> 00:42:40.200
TALIESIN: Stealth.
LAURA: And Pass Without a Trace.

00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:41.418
MATT: Okay.
SAM: Do that.

00:42:41.418 --> 00:42:42.748
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: All right.

00:42:42.748 --> 00:42:43.831
So Pass without a Trace.

00:42:43.831 --> 00:42:46.170
LAURA: I know I did two of those.

00:42:46.170 --> 00:42:48.172
SAM: Can Pass without a Trace work on all of us?

00:42:48.172 --> 00:42:50.128
LAURA: I'm looking, I'm looking, hold on.

00:42:50.128 --> 00:42:51.943
MARISHA: I think we have to be within 30 feet of Jester.

00:42:51.943 --> 00:42:53.826
MATT: You all have to be within 30 feet and

00:42:53.826 --> 00:42:55.465
is it anyone, a number?

00:42:55.465 --> 00:42:58.125
LAURA: I'm looking, I'm looking,
I don't know why it's not up.

00:42:58.125 --> 00:43:00.738
I thought it was a 3rd--

00:43:00.738 --> 00:43:01.704
MATT: Okay, Pass Without a Trace.

00:43:01.704 --> 00:43:03.287
LAURA: I always have it.

00:43:05.473 --> 00:43:07.502
MATT: "Each creature you choose within 30 feet of you."

00:43:07.502 --> 00:43:08.560
SAM: Wow.
LAURA: Okay, so yeah, anybody.

00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:09.393
Everybody.

00:43:09.393 --> 00:43:12.585
SAM: Lucien, Tomb Takers, get close.

00:43:12.585 --> 00:43:13.418
MATT: "Right."

00:43:13.418 --> 00:43:14.334
They all push inward.

00:43:14.334 --> 00:43:16.421
You guys all dive beneath the snowbank

00:43:16.421 --> 00:43:19.504
near this portion of rock that is pressed up

00:43:19.504 --> 00:43:21.416
out of the way where it's pushing the snow.

00:43:21.416 --> 00:43:23.582
As you guys all carefully get in there,

00:43:23.582 --> 00:43:25.230
I need everyone to make a stealth check.

00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:27.767
LAURA: Oh, it's a 2nd.
MARISHA: Okay.

00:43:27.767 --> 00:43:29.971
LIAM: That's a two, I rolled a two.

00:43:29.971 --> 00:43:31.237
Oh no, I didn't.
TRAVIS: Plus ten, right?

00:43:31.237 --> 00:43:32.162
LAURA: Plus ten.
LIAM: Seven.

00:43:32.162 --> 00:43:33.546
MARISHA: Super glad.

00:43:33.546 --> 00:43:35.275
TRAVIS: What?
LIAM: It's hard to read this die.

00:43:35.275 --> 00:43:36.271
LAURA: What am I going to roll?

00:43:36.271 --> 00:43:39.007
What am I rolling? Okay.

00:43:39.007 --> 00:43:40.075
MATT: This is plus 10 from you, right?

00:43:40.075 --> 00:43:40.908
LAURA: Yes.

00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:44.525
(whistling)

00:43:44.525 --> 00:43:46.682
SAM: Did we tangle with a white dragon already?

00:43:46.682 --> 00:43:47.554
LIAM: Yeah, Gelidon.

00:43:47.554 --> 00:43:48.919
MARISHA: Yeah.
LAURA: (gasps)

00:43:48.919 --> 00:43:50.454
SAM: Is this the same one? It's got to be.

00:43:50.454 --> 00:43:51.287
MATT: What you got?

00:43:51.287 --> 00:43:52.484
LAURA: I mean, we are in the same area.

00:43:52.484 --> 00:43:54.650
MARISHA: Yeah, we are. In the icy--
LAURA: Oh my god, this could be him.

00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:55.939
MARISHA: Yeah, 100%.
TRAVIS: 13.

00:43:55.939 --> 00:43:57.242
MATT: 13, with the plus 10?

00:43:57.242 --> 00:43:59.227
MARISHA: 100%.
SAM: Oh, that's rough.

00:43:59.227 --> 00:44:01.670
MARISHA: Huh? You want to fight him?

00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:02.794
LAURA: Thank god for the plus 10.
TRAVIS: I rolled a three.

00:44:02.794 --> 00:44:03.739
MARISHA: It's an ancient white dragon.

00:44:03.739 --> 00:44:04.572
LAURA: 34.

00:44:05.572 --> 00:44:06.823
MATT: 13 to a 34.

00:44:06.823 --> 00:44:07.943
LIAM: Wow.

00:44:07.943 --> 00:44:08.776
MATT: All righty.

00:44:08.776 --> 00:44:09.658
LIAM: 19.

00:44:09.658 --> 00:44:10.875
SAM: Ooh.

00:44:10.875 --> 00:44:11.958
MATT: Okay.

00:44:11.958 --> 00:44:12.928
SAM: 42.

00:44:12.928 --> 00:44:14.931
(laughter)
ASHLEY: Jeez Louise.

00:44:14.931 --> 00:44:16.860
TRAVIS: Is that the highest roll we've ever had, 42?

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:19.517
ASHLEY: Probably, how-- how?

00:44:19.517 --> 00:44:20.350
SAM: Because I got a plus 10.

00:44:20.350 --> 00:44:21.786
LAURA: Rogues, man.
LIAM: Rogues.

00:44:21.786 --> 00:44:22.822
ASHLEY: Natural 20.

00:44:22.822 --> 00:44:23.718
ALL: Ooh.

00:44:23.718 --> 00:44:24.551
MATT: Plus?
ASHLEY: With the new,

00:44:24.551 --> 00:44:28.470
plus two, three, 33 total.

00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:30.528
SAM: You unlocked the advantage within.

00:44:30.528 --> 00:44:31.749
MATT: Because of the natural 20

00:44:31.749 --> 00:44:34.090
that's two in your favor. Caduceus?

00:44:34.090 --> 00:44:35.039
TALIESIN: 22.

00:44:35.039 --> 00:44:37.145
MATT: 22.
ASHLEY: We made crit happen.

00:44:37.145 --> 00:44:38.251
No, but this is not a crit.

00:44:38.251 --> 00:44:39.288
MATT: Okay.

00:44:39.288 --> 00:44:40.448
MARISHA: 26.

00:44:40.448 --> 00:44:41.961
MATT: 26, that was-- Okay.

00:44:41.961 --> 00:44:44.020
You beat me to what I was going to say.

00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:46.869
I was going to say, you guys have, up until Beauregard,

00:44:46.869 --> 00:44:49.584
an even number of successes and failures--

00:44:49.584 --> 00:44:50.417
LAURA: Oh god.

00:44:50.417 --> 00:44:51.855
MATT: -- across you and the Tomb Takers.

00:44:51.855 --> 00:44:54.731
And then Beauregard is the deciding element.

00:44:54.731 --> 00:44:58.323
So as you all sit there quietly,

00:45:01.689 --> 00:45:04.945
(heavy impact)

00:45:04.945 --> 00:45:08.278
You hear this impact and scraping sound.

00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:14.147
It's not super nearby, maybe a couple hundred feet away.

00:45:15.956 --> 00:45:18.789
(stomping)

00:45:21.674 --> 00:45:25.396
(sniffing)

00:45:25.396 --> 00:45:28.332
"I can smell you."

00:45:28.332 --> 00:45:30.972
TRAVIS: (laughs)

00:45:30.972 --> 00:45:34.922
MATT: "I told you I had your scent."

00:45:34.922 --> 00:45:36.947
TRAVIS: (whispers) <i>Shit</i>.

00:45:36.947 --> 00:45:38.813
What did you fucking do?

00:45:38.813 --> 00:45:40.429
LAURA: Do you remember? No, we fucked up.

00:45:40.429 --> 00:45:42.753
TRAVIS: I know!
LAURA: Oh man, we pissed him off so bad.

00:45:42.753 --> 00:45:45.845
ASHLEY: Wait, how can he smell us?

00:45:45.845 --> 00:45:47.603
MARISHA: We've met before.

00:45:49.341 --> 00:45:51.298
ASHLEY: Have I met him before?
MARISHA: I don't think you were there.

00:45:51.298 --> 00:45:52.607
TRAVIS: We should move.

00:45:52.607 --> 00:45:54.706
We're all bunched up, we should move.

00:45:54.706 --> 00:45:57.725
MATT: You hear this heavy smashing swing sound

00:45:57.725 --> 00:45:59.846
and a bunch of snow just gets (whoosh)

00:45:59.846 --> 00:46:01.058
thrown up into the air

00:46:01.058 --> 00:46:04.894
causing this brief snow blind state.

00:46:04.894 --> 00:46:05.908
MARISHA: Aw, shit.

00:46:05.908 --> 00:46:07.963
MATT: And then it all comes to rest as you can see

00:46:07.963 --> 00:46:11.448
she's sweeping her tail through the snow banks around.

00:46:11.448 --> 00:46:12.281
SAM: Oh god.

00:46:12.281 --> 00:46:13.491
TRAVIS: We got to move.
MATT: Rocks and shit are (whoosh)

00:46:13.491 --> 00:46:14.907
LAURA: How are we going to move? Where are we going to go?

00:46:14.907 --> 00:46:17.554
LIAM: We're visible probably.

00:46:17.554 --> 00:46:18.505
TRAVIS: You guys.

00:46:18.505 --> 00:46:21.057
MARISHA: We're fighting this thing, aren't we?

00:46:21.057 --> 00:46:22.408
TRAVIS: Yeah, you got to move.

00:46:22.408 --> 00:46:25.277
SAM: Wait, ooh, maybe Lucien can kill it.

00:46:25.277 --> 00:46:26.936
TRAVIS: I'll kick us off.

00:46:26.936 --> 00:46:30.520
LIAM: Yeah, we've got two adventuring parties here.

00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:31.353
LAURA: Oh my god.

00:46:31.353 --> 00:46:32.914
ASHLEY: We got to move?

00:46:32.914 --> 00:46:35.714
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, move or you die.

00:46:35.714 --> 00:46:37.429
MARISHA: Are we running or are we fighting?

00:46:37.429 --> 00:46:39.130
TRAVIS: It's a fight, it is a fight.

00:46:39.130 --> 00:46:40.005
MARISHA: Okay.
TRAVIS: Move or you die.

00:46:40.005 --> 00:46:42.316
MATT: It's whatever you guys want to do.

00:46:42.316 --> 00:46:43.897
LIAM: We're not going to outrun--

00:46:43.897 --> 00:46:45.563
TRAVIS: No.
MARISHA: Yeah, we can't run in this snow.

00:46:45.563 --> 00:46:46.646
LIAM: We're in a field.

00:46:46.646 --> 00:46:47.904
LAURA: Can we see how close?

00:46:47.904 --> 00:46:48.929
MATT: Make a perception check

00:46:48.929 --> 00:46:51.062
with disadvantage because you guys are buried in snow

00:46:51.062 --> 00:46:53.223
and you're trying to peek though.

00:46:53.223 --> 00:46:55.598
LAURA: Oh, a natural 20 and

00:46:55.598 --> 00:46:56.822
12.

00:46:56.822 --> 00:46:58.488
No.

00:46:58.488 --> 00:46:59.526
13.

00:46:59.526 --> 00:47:02.268
MATT: 13, you're not able to get an angle.

00:47:02.268 --> 00:47:03.810
You're hidden.
TALIESIN: Is that with 10?

00:47:03.810 --> 00:47:05.084
LAURA: Huh?
TALIESIN: Is that with the 10?

00:47:05.084 --> 00:47:06.076
LAURA: That was a perception check.

00:47:06.076 --> 00:47:07.765
TALIESIN: Oh, perception.

00:47:07.765 --> 00:47:10.133
MATT: It's hard to tell.

00:47:10.133 --> 00:47:12.466
A couple of hundred feet off is what you're guessing.

00:47:13.918 --> 00:47:15.900
LAURA: Couple hundred feet off is still pretty far,

00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:18.012
but they they know that we're here, she knows.

00:47:18.012 --> 00:47:19.743
MARISHA: Yeah, if she knows we're here.

00:47:19.743 --> 00:47:21.439
MATT: (sniffing)

00:47:21.439 --> 00:47:25.104
"Where are you?"

00:47:25.104 --> 00:47:26.740
(sniffing)

00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:28.100
TRAVIS: Fuck it, I'm randy.

00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:30.033
I'm going to cast Fly on myself.

00:47:30.033 --> 00:47:32.280
LAURA: Oh my god.
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:34.030
TRAVIS: And I'm going to move (whooshing)

00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:37.744
away from where everybody is in the ground.

00:47:37.744 --> 00:47:39.819
MATT: Really?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:47:39.819 --> 00:47:41.316
MATT: All right.

00:47:41.316 --> 00:47:44.174
Fjord just takes off at what speed?

00:47:44.174 --> 00:47:45.092
TRAVIS: 60 feet.

00:47:45.092 --> 00:47:46.324
MATT: 60 feet.

00:47:46.324 --> 00:47:47.923
SAM: ? (vocalizes the background music) ?

00:47:47.923 --> 00:47:49.700
LAURA: Okay, so we're doing this.

00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:50.808
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:47:50.808 --> 00:47:53.313
TRAVIS: You guys are in analysis paralysis.

00:47:53.313 --> 00:47:55.494
This is happening.

00:47:55.494 --> 00:47:57.958
MARISHA: Lord have mercy.

00:47:57.958 --> 00:47:59.058
SAM: Fjord have mercy.

00:47:59.058 --> 00:48:00.891
TRAVIS: One Cone of Cold over in that ground where

00:48:00.891 --> 00:48:02.612
everybody's laying within 30 feet of each other,

00:48:02.612 --> 00:48:03.579
we're all hurting.

00:48:03.579 --> 00:48:06.190
LIAM: Yeah, I'll say once Fjord pops the bottle,

00:48:06.190 --> 00:48:08.002
Caleb will use those boots

00:48:08.002 --> 00:48:10.437
and start flying at a different angle.

00:48:10.437 --> 00:48:12.050
MARISHA: Yeah, if we're doing this, I'll bolt

00:48:12.050 --> 00:48:13.170
in an opposite direction.

00:48:13.170 --> 00:48:14.003
LIAM: Holy shit.

00:48:14.003 --> 00:48:15.285
TRAVIS: Let's go, let's go.
TALIESIN: Spread.

00:48:15.285 --> 00:48:16.919
MARISHA: All spread.

00:48:16.919 --> 00:48:18.800
MATT: Okay, I'm bringing up the--

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:20.579
LIAM: Bring out that dragon.

00:48:20.579 --> 00:48:22.300
That bad dragon.

00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:24.380
MARISHA: So, let's see.

00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:25.619
ASHLEY: I'll say-- you know.

00:48:25.619 --> 00:48:26.452
MARISHA: We super pissed it off.

00:48:26.452 --> 00:48:27.788
ASHLEY: Thought we needed a lil spice for today.

00:48:27.788 --> 00:48:29.205
LIAM: Literally true.

00:48:30.047 --> 00:48:30.880
TRAVIS: What's that?

00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:31.968
LIAM: It's literally true.

00:48:31.968 --> 00:48:34.218
(laughter)

00:48:37.109 --> 00:48:38.150
MATT: Okay.

00:48:39.026 --> 00:48:40.609
MARISHA: Did not write.

00:48:41.762 --> 00:48:43.728
ASHLEY: ? (vocalizes the previous background music) ?

00:48:43.728 --> 00:48:45.303
SAM: We've faced this thing before.

00:48:45.303 --> 00:48:46.212
LIAM: Yeah.
MARISHA: Yep.

00:48:46.212 --> 00:48:47.865
TRAVIS: And ran.

00:48:47.865 --> 00:48:50.633
LAURA: Stood in a bubble and screamed.

00:48:50.633 --> 00:48:52.747
LIAM: We ain't got time to make that bubble.

00:48:52.747 --> 00:48:53.580
That's a minute.

00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:56.342
MATT: So you dart off out of the snow.

00:48:56.342 --> 00:48:57.606
You guys see Fjord just take off

00:48:57.606 --> 00:49:00.361
like a bullet out of the space.
TRAVIS: I'll break to the right.

00:49:00.361 --> 00:49:01.567
MATT: Off of the right.

00:49:01.567 --> 00:49:02.876
Then you hear immediately,

00:49:02.876 --> 00:49:04.123
(snarling)

00:49:04.123 --> 00:49:05.123
"There!"

00:49:05.123 --> 00:49:06.373
(whooshing)

00:49:06.373 --> 00:49:07.783
LAURA: No!

00:49:07.783 --> 00:49:10.234
MATT: And the wings start taking off in Fjord's direction.

00:49:10.234 --> 00:49:11.683
SAM: As soon as I hear those wings whooshing,

00:49:11.683 --> 00:49:14.531
I'm going to pop out from hiding and fire.

00:49:14.531 --> 00:49:15.715
How far away?

00:49:15.715 --> 00:49:17.115
TRAVIS: Hundred feet.

00:49:17.115 --> 00:49:18.650
SAM: I'm going to fire.

00:49:18.650 --> 00:49:19.483
Okay.

00:49:19.483 --> 00:49:21.269
TRAVIS: Is that right, hundred feet?

00:49:21.269 --> 00:49:24.300
MATT: All right, so you're firing at the dragon?

00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:25.742
SAM: Yes.
MATT: All right.

00:49:25.742 --> 00:49:27.926
You pop out and go to shoot.

00:49:27.926 --> 00:49:29.453
SAM: Please work.

00:49:29.453 --> 00:49:30.286
Okay.

00:49:30.286 --> 00:49:31.607
It's a strong roll.

00:49:31.607 --> 00:49:33.182
27 to hit.

00:49:33.182 --> 00:49:34.856
MATT: That does hit.

00:49:34.856 --> 00:49:37.133
SAM: I should have said this before I fired.

00:49:37.133 --> 00:49:38.923
Sorry, I have the page up.

00:49:38.923 --> 00:49:41.165
I want to use a cataclysm bolt.

00:49:41.165 --> 00:49:42.704
MATT: Okay, okay.

00:49:42.704 --> 00:49:44.020
SAM: I don't know what that will do.

00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:45.236
I don't know.

00:49:45.236 --> 00:49:46.622
Never used one before.
LAURA: What's a cataclysm bolt?!

00:49:46.622 --> 00:49:47.610
SAM: I found three of them.

00:49:47.610 --> 00:49:49.114
I'm using one.

00:49:49.114 --> 00:49:50.304
MATT: They're in D&amp;D Beyond, if you look them up.

00:49:50.304 --> 00:49:51.922
SAM: No, no, I've got it but I had to roll--

00:49:51.922 --> 00:49:52.866
MATT: You have to roll to see what it does.

00:49:52.866 --> 00:49:53.893
SAM: -- what it does, right?

00:49:53.893 --> 00:49:57.480
Yeah, so first can I roll for damage and stuff?

00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:58.728
MATT: Yes, you do.
SAM: Okay.

00:49:58.728 --> 00:50:01.286
LIAM: Also, DM, I've already called it.
TALIESIN: You've done this to us.

00:50:01.286 --> 00:50:02.648
LIAM: Caleb is Stormrider Booting

00:50:02.648 --> 00:50:04.567
in an opposite angle from Fjord.

00:50:04.567 --> 00:50:06.486
MATT: Okay, you got it.

00:50:06.486 --> 00:50:09.544
I'm going to go ahead, after Sam's roll here,

00:50:09.544 --> 00:50:11.980
put down a battlefield because this is now become a battle.

00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:13.507
SAM: Oh boy.
LIAM: Oh my goodness.

00:50:13.507 --> 00:50:14.983
(laughter)
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

00:50:14.983 --> 00:50:17.501
LAURA: It could have not been a battle.

00:50:17.501 --> 00:50:18.334
LIAM: Could've.

00:50:18.334 --> 00:50:19.167
TRAVIS: No, it was a battle.

00:50:19.167 --> 00:50:20.400
LIAM: We have two adventuring parties.

00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:22.502
TRAVIS: Totally, we have numbers.

00:50:22.502 --> 00:50:24.597
He was smelling, there's nowhere to run.
LIAM: Yeah.

00:50:24.597 --> 00:50:27.039
TRAVIS: It's a fight and we were bunched up in the snow.

00:50:27.039 --> 00:50:29.281
SAM: That's 34 points.

00:50:30.116 --> 00:50:31.104
MATT: 34 points, all right.

00:50:31.104 --> 00:50:33.235
SAM: And then the cataclysm bolt--

00:50:33.235 --> 00:50:34.068
MATT: Yes.

00:50:34.068 --> 00:50:34.901
SAM: -- is--

00:50:34.901 --> 00:50:37.421
LIAM: Good leader move, good job, Fjord.

00:50:37.421 --> 00:50:39.787
SAM: Are you fucking kidding me?

00:50:39.787 --> 00:50:44.239
The bolt freezes around the target to cause ice damage.

00:50:44.239 --> 00:50:45.197
Fuck you!

00:50:45.197 --> 00:50:50.197
(laughter)

00:50:50.833 --> 00:50:51.981
LIAM: Oh man, you need to--

00:50:51.981 --> 00:50:53.073
MATT: Yeah, it's immunity to cold.

00:50:53.073 --> 00:50:54.895
TRAVIS: Oh no.

00:50:54.895 --> 00:50:56.726
Oh no!

00:50:56.726 --> 00:50:58.370
MATT: But you still do the original damage from the impact.

00:50:58.370 --> 00:50:59.203
LIAM: Wow.

00:50:59.203 --> 00:51:00.829
LAURA: And you did sneak attack, right?

00:51:00.829 --> 00:51:02.271
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
LIAM: Yeah.

00:51:02.271 --> 00:51:03.104
MATT: Okay.

00:51:03.104 --> 00:51:04.434
SAM: Oh no, wait, no I don't get a bonus action.

00:51:04.434 --> 00:51:05.274
This is a sneak attack round.

00:51:05.274 --> 00:51:06.787
MATT: Yeah, this is just jump out.

00:51:06.787 --> 00:51:08.130
So I'll be right back.

00:51:08.130 --> 00:51:11.544
SAM: Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, guys.
LAURA: Oh jeez.

00:51:11.544 --> 00:51:13.360
MARISHA: I found my notes for Gelidon.

00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:14.864
I wrote fucking nothing.

00:51:14.864 --> 00:51:17.357
SAM: This combat is brought to you by Dwarven Forge

00:51:17.357 --> 00:51:20.373
and by Fjord's horniness for battle.

00:51:20.373 --> 00:51:21.340
(laughter)

00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:23.125
SAM: Dwarven Forge is having a restock soon.

00:51:23.125 --> 00:51:25.400
Join the email list--
ALL: Ooh!

00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:28.198
SAM: -- to be alerted when your
long-awaited sets have returned

00:51:28.198 --> 00:51:30.179
or email DwarvenForge.com.

00:51:30.179 --> 00:51:32.076
MATT: You guys are hiding over here-ish.

00:51:32.076 --> 00:51:34.036
I'm just going to start throwing you in since that was the

00:51:34.036 --> 00:51:34.993
nature of everyone's

00:51:34.993 --> 00:51:37.704
quick process of leaping out

00:51:37.704 --> 00:51:39.216
and taking care of their business here.

00:51:39.216 --> 00:51:40.886
LAURA: Am I taking care of--
SAM: Taking care of business.

00:51:40.886 --> 00:51:43.749
We're all dropping deuces in the snow.

00:51:43.749 --> 00:51:45.038
LIAM: Yep, yep.

00:51:45.038 --> 00:51:47.131
SAM: (blows raspberry)

00:51:47.131 --> 00:51:47.964
LIAM: Motherf--

00:51:47.964 --> 00:51:49.162
MATT: All right, and then we have--

00:51:49.162 --> 00:51:50.653
MARISHA: Oh god.

00:51:50.653 --> 00:51:51.486
MATT: Hidden over here.

00:51:51.486 --> 00:51:56.292
SAM: ? (vocalizes the background music) ?

00:51:56.292 --> 00:51:57.125
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

00:51:57.971 --> 00:51:59.119
TRAVIS: It was on you.

00:51:59.119 --> 00:52:01.042
It was on all of us.

00:52:01.042 --> 00:52:02.234
LIAM: Good job, Ashley.

00:52:02.234 --> 00:52:04.137
LAURA: Oh my-- we're so clumped.

00:52:04.137 --> 00:52:05.447
TRAVIS: Yeah.
ASHLEY: I do my best.

00:52:05.447 --> 00:52:08.889
TRAVIS: He'd just take two steps, be closer and we'd be--

00:52:10.554 --> 00:52:14.147
MATT: Now Fjord, you took off this direction, you said?

00:52:14.147 --> 00:52:17.675
TRAVIS: Yeah, I went to the right, trying to draw his--

00:52:17.675 --> 00:52:19.747
if he was looking at
12 o'clock in our direction

00:52:19.747 --> 00:52:22.603
or slightly off, I just want him to turn 45 degrees.

00:52:22.603 --> 00:52:25.047
So radial out.

00:52:25.047 --> 00:52:27.377
MATT: And at fly speed, action to cast it,

00:52:27.377 --> 00:52:29.986
and then 60, so you would be--

00:52:29.986 --> 00:52:30.936
LIAM: Holy smokes.

00:52:30.936 --> 00:52:34.214
MATT: You would be right about here-ish.

00:52:34.214 --> 00:52:36.745
TRAVIS: And what direction is he in?

00:52:36.745 --> 00:52:37.578
MATT: She--

00:52:37.578 --> 00:52:38.976
TRAVIS: She, thank you.

00:52:38.976 --> 00:52:40.439
Gelidon, did we know that?

00:52:40.439 --> 00:52:41.272
ASHLEY: Gelidon?

00:52:41.272 --> 00:52:42.105
MATT: -- is about there.

00:52:42.105 --> 00:52:43.263
ASHLEY: Gelidon, she's a big girl.

00:52:43.263 --> 00:52:45.229
LAURA: Jeez.
SAM: Jeez.

00:52:45.229 --> 00:52:46.062
TALIESIN: Oh no.

00:52:47.145 --> 00:52:48.476
MATT: She's an ancient white dragon.

00:52:48.476 --> 00:52:49.951
LAURA: She's an ancient white dragon.

00:52:49.951 --> 00:52:52.203
MARISHA: She's an ancient?
LAURA: She's an ancient--

00:52:52.203 --> 00:52:53.518
she's Vorugal's--
LIAM: Vorugal level.

00:52:53.518 --> 00:52:56.011
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: (laughs)

00:52:56.011 --> 00:52:59.644
LIAM: And we have no goristro, no demon popping in here.

00:52:59.644 --> 00:53:01.654
MARISHA: No plan. We had a plan.
SAM: We have a Lucien, we have two extra eyes.

00:53:01.654 --> 00:53:02.562
MARISHA: Last time.

00:53:02.562 --> 00:53:03.395
LIAM and SAM: Yep.

00:53:03.395 --> 00:53:04.606
ASHLEY: Oh god.

00:53:04.606 --> 00:53:06.841
MATT: So I would like everyone to roll initiative, please.

00:53:06.841 --> 00:53:08.139
(laughter)
(groaning)

00:53:08.139 --> 00:53:09.134
LAURA: God.

00:53:09.134 --> 00:53:12.615
SAM: ? (vocalizes the background music) ?

00:53:12.615 --> 00:53:13.652
LIAM: Roll my wizard hat.

00:53:13.652 --> 00:53:14.577
SAM: Oh.
LIAM: Ugh.

00:53:14.577 --> 00:53:15.993
TALIESIN: Yes.
SAM: We're okay.

00:53:15.993 --> 00:53:16.909
TALIESIN: No.

00:53:16.909 --> 00:53:18.187
LIAM: That's terrible.
MARISHA: Mmkay.

00:53:18.187 --> 00:53:20.846
LAURA: I don't even want this number.

00:53:20.846 --> 00:53:21.763
LIAM: Are you high?

00:53:21.763 --> 00:53:24.036
LAURA: Yep.
LIAM: Yep. Hate that spot.

00:53:24.036 --> 00:53:26.403
That's for Beauregard.

00:53:26.403 --> 00:53:27.307
LAURA: That's not for the cleric.

00:53:27.307 --> 00:53:28.363
TRAVIS: (sharp breath)

00:53:28.363 --> 00:53:31.553
TALIESIN: I didn't have time to cast a fucking spell.

00:53:31.553 --> 00:53:32.927
MARISHA: No, we're--

00:53:32.927 --> 00:53:34.127
MATT: 25 to 20.

00:53:34.127 --> 00:53:35.052
SAM: 25!

00:53:35.052 --> 00:53:37.200
TRAVIS: Let's go!
MATT: All right.

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:38.432
MARISHA: 20.

00:53:38.432 --> 00:53:39.265
LAURA: 20.

00:53:39.265 --> 00:53:40.720
ASHLEY: 21 for me.

00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:42.281
(cheering)

00:53:42.281 --> 00:53:44.207
MATT: Veth then Yasha.

00:53:44.207 --> 00:53:46.964
Then Jester.

00:53:46.964 --> 00:53:48.607
MARISHA: Beau then Jester, I think.

00:53:48.607 --> 00:53:49.481
TRAVIS: Beau then Jester, yeah.

00:53:49.481 --> 00:53:51.910
MATT: I'm sorry, yeah, Beau then Jester.

00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:54.050
LAURA: Unless we want to do a--

00:53:54.050 --> 00:53:55.508
MARISHA: Tag team?

00:53:55.508 --> 00:53:57.487
LAURA: Yeah, a move.

00:53:57.487 --> 00:53:58.445
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:53:58.445 --> 00:53:59.933
A fastball special?

00:53:59.933 --> 00:54:00.933
LAURA: Yeah.

00:54:02.097 --> 00:54:04.234
MATT: All right.
LAURA: I could fastball special us.

00:54:04.234 --> 00:54:05.509
MARISHA: And get in--

00:54:06.688 --> 00:54:07.605
MATT: 20 to 15.

00:54:09.814 --> 00:54:11.934
TRAVIS: (chuckles)

00:54:11.934 --> 00:54:12.767
Cool.

00:54:14.767 --> 00:54:15.850
LIAM: Oh boy.

00:54:17.728 --> 00:54:18.844
MATT: 15 to 10.

00:54:18.844 --> 00:54:19.677
TRAVIS: 13.

00:54:21.175 --> 00:54:22.177
MARISHA: What?

00:54:23.494 --> 00:54:25.125
LAURA: (whispering) I could bamf us.

00:54:25.125 --> 00:54:27.202
TALIESIN: Crickets, crickets.

00:54:28.452 --> 00:54:31.092
MARISHA: (whispering) And get on him?

00:54:31.092 --> 00:54:31.925
That's cool.

00:54:31.925 --> 00:54:33.129
TALIESIN: This is so bad.

00:54:33.129 --> 00:54:34.265
LAURA: On to--

00:54:34.265 --> 00:54:35.363
MATT: 10 to five?

00:54:35.363 --> 00:54:36.379
TALIESIN: Nine.

00:54:36.379 --> 00:54:37.801
SAM: Oh.

00:54:37.801 --> 00:54:38.705
That's actually good.

00:54:38.705 --> 00:54:39.712
That's a good place for you.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:54:39.712 --> 00:54:40.868
SAM: Yeah, that's where we want you.

00:54:40.868 --> 00:54:43.962
LIAM: Also, Caleb is not with the group.

00:54:43.962 --> 00:54:45.329
LAURA: Where are you, what did you do?

00:54:45.329 --> 00:54:47.608
LIAM: He'll probably be on that--

00:54:47.608 --> 00:54:51.242
He would have taken the V direction away from Fjord.

00:54:51.242 --> 00:54:52.263
MATT: So you are up.

00:54:52.263 --> 00:54:53.798
LIAM: I would be on the side of the map.

00:54:53.798 --> 00:54:55.556
MATT: 60 feet, right?
LIAM: Mm-hm.

00:54:55.556 --> 00:54:57.723
MATT: Yeah, you are over here.

00:55:00.415 --> 00:55:01.968
Sure.

00:55:01.968 --> 00:55:02.801
All righty.

00:55:02.801 --> 00:55:03.782
SAM: What is that shirt?

00:55:03.782 --> 00:55:05.145
MATT: So now-- hmm?

00:55:05.145 --> 00:55:06.478
This here?
SAM: I love it.

00:55:06.478 --> 00:55:09.347
MATT: Yeah, it's from Into the Mother Lands.

00:55:09.347 --> 00:55:11.268
So top of the initiative round,

00:55:11.268 --> 00:55:12.888
we have Veth followed by Yasha.

00:55:12.888 --> 00:55:14.674
Veth, what are you doing?

00:55:14.674 --> 00:55:15.817
SAM: Same thing again.

00:55:15.817 --> 00:55:16.662
LIAM: Holy cow, I'm running to the bathroom.

00:55:16.662 --> 00:55:18.980
MATT: All right.
SAM: I'm going to bonus action--

00:55:18.980 --> 00:55:20.579
TRAVIS: (giggles)

00:55:20.579 --> 00:55:23.413
SAM: Bonus action, Voltaic Bolt.

00:55:23.413 --> 00:55:25.037
MATT: Okay.

00:55:25.037 --> 00:55:27.945
SAM: Juice up the old bolt.

00:55:27.945 --> 00:55:29.854
And then I will aim and fire again.

00:55:29.854 --> 00:55:30.687
MATT: Okay.

00:55:31.793 --> 00:55:33.671
SAM: Not as good, not as good, not as good.

00:55:33.671 --> 00:55:35.592
not as good, not as good.

00:55:35.592 --> 00:55:37.407
That's a 20.

00:55:37.407 --> 00:55:38.344
MATT: That's a 20?

00:55:38.344 --> 00:55:39.540
That just hits.

00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:40.974
SAM: Ooh!

00:55:40.974 --> 00:55:41.924
MARISHA: 20 just hits.

00:55:41.924 --> 00:55:44.216
SAM: Oh, but no sneak attack this time.

00:55:44.216 --> 00:55:45.120
MATT: Correct, because you're not hidden.

00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:46.639
SAM: Balls!

00:55:46.639 --> 00:55:47.696
Balls and anus.

00:55:47.696 --> 00:55:48.907
Shit.

00:55:48.907 --> 00:55:50.531
SAM: Well, I'll just do that damage then.

00:55:50.531 --> 00:55:52.198
I guess it's 1d6.

00:55:53.135 --> 00:55:56.803
Ooh, okay, 11 points plus the spell,

00:55:56.803 --> 00:55:58.911
which is three more d6.

00:55:58.911 --> 00:55:59.744
MATT: Okay.

00:56:01.968 --> 00:56:06.248
SAM: Ooh, another 13.

00:56:06.248 --> 00:56:07.731
MATT: Another 13, you got it.

00:56:07.731 --> 00:56:09.373
SAM: So wait, what did I say on the first one?

00:56:09.373 --> 00:56:10.873
It was--? What was it?

00:56:10.873 --> 00:56:12.137
TRAVIS: 20 just hits.

00:56:12.137 --> 00:56:15.021
SAM: No, no, no, I rolled a--

00:56:15.021 --> 00:56:16.968
Shit. What did I just roll?

00:56:16.968 --> 00:56:17.801
LAURA: I wasn't paying attention.

00:56:17.801 --> 00:56:18.634
SAM: I think it was 20.

00:56:18.634 --> 00:56:20.712
It was 13 plus whatever I said at the beginning

00:56:20.712 --> 00:56:22.790
which was another 10?

00:56:22.790 --> 00:56:24.080
No, fuck!

00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:26.389
I've forgotten what I rolled!

00:56:26.389 --> 00:56:27.656
MATT: You just told me 13 damage at one point.

00:56:27.656 --> 00:56:29.273
SAM: No, there was another roll before that,

00:56:29.273 --> 00:56:30.477
TALIESIN: Like 11 or something?

00:56:30.477 --> 00:56:31.743
SAM: Yeah, yeah, that's what it was.

00:56:31.743 --> 00:56:33.585
It was 11 plus 13. Thank you, thank you.

00:56:33.585 --> 00:56:35.771
TALIESIN: I have no idea how that happened.

00:56:35.771 --> 00:56:36.779
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: Yeah, I know.

00:56:36.779 --> 00:56:38.908
I'm looking at spells.

00:56:38.908 --> 00:56:40.826
SAM: And I guess I'll move.

00:56:40.826 --> 00:56:42.211
MATT: Where you want to move?

00:56:42.211 --> 00:56:45.789
SAM: Straight down the line of that ice bridge.

00:56:45.789 --> 00:56:46.622
MATT: Right here?

00:56:46.622 --> 00:56:47.455
SAM: Yeah.
MATT: All right.

00:56:47.455 --> 00:56:48.788
TALIESIN: You got a plan?

00:56:48.788 --> 00:56:50.563
MARISHA: No.
SAM: If I can get behind it,

00:56:50.563 --> 00:56:51.430
that would be cool.

00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:52.871
MATT: Speed of 30?

00:56:52.871 --> 00:56:54.805
SAM: 30.
MATT: 30, you can't quite get to it.

00:56:54.805 --> 00:56:55.897
SAM: Cool, that's good.

00:56:55.897 --> 00:56:57.965
MATT: All righty, that finishes that.

00:56:57.965 --> 00:57:00.005
Yasha, you're up. Beau, you're on deck.

00:57:00.005 --> 00:57:03.480
ASHLEY: Okay, I poof out of...

00:57:04.413 --> 00:57:05.249
the snow.

00:57:05.249 --> 00:57:06.313
MATT: You're right there.

00:57:06.313 --> 00:57:08.779
ASHLEY: Yes, and as I do and see her,

00:57:08.779 --> 00:57:11.729
I will let out a battle cry,

00:57:13.435 --> 00:57:14.685
which gives everyone advantage on

00:57:14.685 --> 00:57:17.436
attack rolls and saving throws.
TRAVIS: What's it sound like?

00:57:17.436 --> 00:57:18.277
ASHLEY: (lightly grunts)

00:57:18.277 --> 00:57:20.306
(laughter)

00:57:20.306 --> 00:57:21.713
TRAVIS: Like a dry fart, I like it.

00:57:21.713 --> 00:57:22.671
(<i>pah</i>)

00:57:22.671 --> 00:57:24.218
ASHLEY: I'm trying to be quiet so
she doesn't know where I am.

00:57:24.218 --> 00:57:27.225
MATT: Everyone within what distance to you?

00:57:27.225 --> 00:57:28.058
MARISHA: (whispering) Let me make sure.

00:57:28.058 --> 00:57:31.580
ASHLEY: 60 feet, up to 10 other creatures of your choice.

00:57:31.580 --> 00:57:34.168
MATT: Okay. Fjord, you would just barely be in range.

00:57:34.168 --> 00:57:35.422
TRAVIS: Mm.
LAURA: Sweet.

00:57:35.422 --> 00:57:36.775
MATT: So yeah, that's everybody.
TRAVIS: Thank you.

00:57:36.775 --> 00:57:38.674
MATT: Up to how many creatures?
ASHLEY: 10.

00:57:38.674 --> 00:57:41.817
MATT: 10, okay, so that's all of you seven,

00:57:41.817 --> 00:57:45.362
plus three of them, of the Tomb Takers if you want to.

00:57:45.362 --> 00:57:47.561
TALIESIN: Or 10 others or 10 creatures?

00:57:47.561 --> 00:57:50.217
ASHLEY: 10 creatures, 10 creatures total.

00:57:50.217 --> 00:57:51.608
TRAVIS: And what does it give us?

00:57:51.608 --> 00:57:54.708
ASHLEY: Advantage on attack rolls and saving throws.

00:57:54.708 --> 00:57:55.739
TRAVIS: Okay.
LAURA: That's great.

00:57:55.739 --> 00:57:56.998
TALIESIN: (sigh)

00:57:56.998 --> 00:57:58.839
LIAM: Attack rolls and saving throws.
SAM: That's amazing.

00:57:58.839 --> 00:57:59.959
LIAM: Yeah.
MARISHA: Is that your battle cry?

00:57:59.959 --> 00:58:02.021
ASHLEY: That's the battle cry.
TRAVIS: For one turn?

00:58:02.021 --> 00:58:03.454
ASHLEY: For one turn.
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:58:05.826 --> 00:58:08.175
ASHLEY: Do we want to help out the others?

00:58:08.175 --> 00:58:09.282
LAURA: Yeah.

00:58:09.282 --> 00:58:11.474
ASHLEY: Let's do Lucien.

00:58:14.751 --> 00:58:17.321
Who else is there? Otis, Tyffial--

00:58:17.321 --> 00:58:20.880
SAM: Cree.
ASHLEY: Let's do Cree and...

00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:22.038
one more.

00:58:25.728 --> 00:58:27.094
Tyffial, Tyffial.

00:58:27.094 --> 00:58:28.677
MATT: Okay, you got it.

00:58:30.793 --> 00:58:35.793
ASHLEY: Okay, and then as a bonus action,
I would like to rage.

00:58:35.812 --> 00:58:37.331
MATT: You got it.

00:58:37.331 --> 00:58:41.234
ASHLEY: And then-- oh no, wait,
Zealous Presence is a bonus action.

00:58:41.234 --> 00:58:43.659
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
MATT: So you would not be able to

00:58:43.659 --> 00:58:45.600
rage necessarily at the moment.

00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:47.183
ASHLEY: Okay, and then...

00:58:49.751 --> 00:58:52.201
Ah shit, I should've raged first.

00:58:52.201 --> 00:58:53.034
(pop)

00:58:53.034 --> 00:58:54.780
TALIESIN: You can still--

00:58:54.780 --> 00:58:58.780
you can burn your action to rage if you have to.

00:59:01.292 --> 00:59:02.137
LAURA: Can you?

00:59:02.137 --> 00:59:03.684
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's a bonus action you can just,

00:59:03.684 --> 00:59:05.442
you can use anything greater.

00:59:05.442 --> 00:59:08.911
It's action, movement, bonus action.

00:59:08.911 --> 00:59:11.207
So you can burn your movement or your action

00:59:11.207 --> 00:59:14.728
for bonus action, and you can burn your action for movement.

00:59:14.728 --> 00:59:16.182
LAURA: Oh, okay.

00:59:16.182 --> 00:59:17.015
TALIESIN: If you like.

00:59:17.015 --> 00:59:21.515
ASHLEY: Yeah, (clears throat) I'll do that.

00:59:22.519 --> 00:59:23.602
I'll do that.

00:59:25.891 --> 00:59:27.697
So I'm going to rage and--

00:59:27.697 --> 00:59:30.196
MATT: Instead of the shout, you mean?

00:59:30.196 --> 00:59:31.279
ASHLEY: No, as a...

00:59:32.289 --> 00:59:35.198
LAURA: Action?
ASHLEY: As an action.

00:59:35.198 --> 00:59:36.069
Can I do that?

00:59:36.069 --> 00:59:37.589
MATT: It doesn't-- you can't transfer necessarily

00:59:37.589 --> 00:59:38.612
a bonus action into an action.

00:59:38.612 --> 00:59:39.633
TALIESIN: Oh, you can't?

00:59:39.633 --> 00:59:40.967
MATT: No, that's a Pathfinder thing.

00:59:40.967 --> 00:59:42.541
TALIESIN: Oh, okay, never mind.

00:59:42.541 --> 00:59:44.074
ASHLEY: That's why it's kind of familiar.

00:59:44.074 --> 00:59:45.561
Okay, so,

00:59:45.561 --> 00:59:47.478
what I'll do then is...

00:59:50.023 --> 00:59:51.052
This is dumb.

00:59:51.052 --> 00:59:52.969
I'm going to run up to...

00:59:54.727 --> 00:59:56.323
TRAVIS: Best plans always are.

00:59:56.323 --> 00:59:57.443
ASHLEY: I'm going to run up to it.

00:59:57.443 --> 00:59:58.815
MATT: All right.

00:59:58.815 --> 00:59:59.984
LAURA: (laughs)

00:59:59.984 --> 01:00:02.002
ASHLEY: Can I get all the way?
MATT: 40, 45, 50?

01:00:02.002 --> 01:00:02.860
ASHLEY: Oh, no, I can't.

01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:04.994
Okay, so I'll stay behind that...

01:00:04.994 --> 01:00:06.152
SAM: Snowbank?
ASHLEY: Snowbank.

01:00:06.152 --> 01:00:07.476
MATT: Right there?
ASHLEY: Yep.

01:00:07.476 --> 01:00:08.694
MATT: You've got it.

01:00:09.544 --> 01:00:10.377
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:00:10.377 --> 01:00:12.577
MATT: Okay, that finishes your turn, Yasha.

01:00:12.577 --> 01:00:15.103
Beau, then Jester's on deck.

01:00:15.103 --> 01:00:15.943
LAURA: Beau?

01:00:15.943 --> 01:00:20.326
MARISHA: Okay, I am going to--

01:00:20.326 --> 01:00:24.048
let me make sure-- (mumbling)

01:00:25.043 --> 01:00:26.562
At the start of my turn.

01:00:26.562 --> 01:00:28.817
So at the start of my turn, I am going to go ahead

01:00:28.817 --> 01:00:30.630
and activate my Maelstrom Gloves.

01:00:30.630 --> 01:00:31.742
MATT: (whoosh)

01:00:31.742 --> 01:00:33.583
Sparks (boom) shoot through your fists.

01:00:33.583 --> 01:00:35.311
LAURA: And at the same time--
MARISHA: And then I look at Jess.

01:00:35.311 --> 01:00:36.487
LAURA: Since we're both going at the same time,

01:00:36.487 --> 01:00:39.654
I'm going to grab her hand and I'm going to--

01:00:40.849 --> 01:00:42.632
MARISHA: Here we go.
LAURA: -- Dimension Door us

01:00:42.632 --> 01:00:44.976
onto the back of the dragon.
SAM: Yes.

01:00:44.976 --> 01:00:45.809
MATT: Okay.

01:00:45.809 --> 01:00:47.983
TRAVIS: Oh, let's go, ladies!
MATT: Okay.

01:00:47.983 --> 01:00:49.383
SAM: Dimension Dooring to a dragon?

01:00:49.383 --> 01:00:53.602
That sounds like a terrible idea.
TRAVIS: That's what I'm talking about!

01:00:53.602 --> 01:00:56.119
LAURA: -- not in the dragon.
TRAVIS: That's what I'm talking about.

01:00:56.119 --> 01:00:57.424
MARISHA: Let's go.

01:00:58.593 --> 01:01:02.100
LIAM: It's that one spot on her back
that she can never quite--

01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:03.441
MARISHA: Mm-hm.
LIAM: -- scratch.

01:01:03.441 --> 01:01:05.057
TRAVIS: First step's always the hardest,
then you just go with it.

01:01:05.057 --> 01:01:07.252
TALIESIN: Have you seen weightlifters mess with each other

01:01:07.252 --> 01:01:08.638
by putting a sign on their back.

01:01:08.638 --> 01:01:10.758
Because they're all so muscly, they can't--

01:01:10.758 --> 01:01:11.894
MATT: There you go!

01:01:11.894 --> 01:01:12.986
So you both (whoosh)

01:01:12.986 --> 01:01:15.203
vanish and then (whoosh) onto the back of the dragon

01:01:15.203 --> 01:01:18.668
right as its wings are about to kick up.

01:01:18.668 --> 01:01:21.399
And as you both land you see the head turn

01:01:21.399 --> 01:01:23.462
to the side and you just catch the edge

01:01:23.462 --> 01:01:25.046
of the light blue cold eye

01:01:25.046 --> 01:01:28.294
look back over the shoulder at you both.

01:01:28.294 --> 01:01:29.127
What are you doing?

01:01:29.127 --> 01:01:31.870
MARISHA: So as we poof out of the Dimension Door

01:01:31.870 --> 01:01:33.950
I'm going to swing my staff above overhead

01:01:33.950 --> 01:01:36.001
and just come down out of the portal

01:01:36.001 --> 01:01:38.367
with a big slap to its head.
MATT: You got it.

01:01:38.367 --> 01:01:39.922
Go for it.

01:01:39.922 --> 01:01:42.697
MARISHA: A-pop pop

01:01:42.697 --> 01:01:43.778
with the staff.

01:01:43.778 --> 01:01:45.822
Ooh, one of those is a natural one.

01:01:45.822 --> 01:01:46.698
Super bad.

01:01:46.698 --> 01:01:48.705
Yeah, there's a 20 total.

01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:51.003
MATT: Okay, natural one misses 20 total just hits.

01:01:51.003 --> 01:01:53.303
MARISHA: Okay, so one hit there.

01:01:57.235 --> 01:01:59.360
Ugh, weak damage.

01:02:01.393 --> 01:02:03.154
Nine damage with my staff.

01:02:03.154 --> 01:02:04.408
MATT: All righty.

01:02:04.408 --> 01:02:05.612
MARISHA: Stunning Strike.

01:02:05.612 --> 01:02:06.445
MATT: Okay.

01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:11.717
MARISHA: I don't expect this thing to have low constitution.

01:02:16.850 --> 01:02:20.565
MATT: It's going to use a legendary save to save.

01:02:20.565 --> 01:02:21.475
TALIESIN: Hey!
MARISHA: Okay.

01:02:21.475 --> 01:02:22.372
TALIESIN: That's great.

01:02:22.372 --> 01:02:23.772
MATT: It rolled a natural one.

01:02:23.772 --> 01:02:25.939
(laughter)
MARISHA: Okay!

01:02:25.939 --> 01:02:28.006
MATT: Yeah, so used the save.
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, we're chalking 'em off.

01:02:28.006 --> 01:02:30.962
MARISHA: Yeah, we're chalking, yeah that's something.
TALIESIN: Already knocked one out, way to go.

01:02:30.962 --> 01:02:31.795
MARISHA: Okay.

01:02:34.305 --> 01:02:35.421
Bonus action, pop pop.

01:02:35.421 --> 01:02:36.724
MATT: Go for it.

01:02:36.724 --> 01:02:39.307
MARISHA: That's a d12, get outta here.

01:02:40.982 --> 01:02:45.982
Okay, that's a natural 19 on my first one for 29 total.

01:02:46.615 --> 01:02:47.965
MATT: 29 total, that hits.

01:02:47.965 --> 01:02:52.673
MARISHA: And then the other one
I'm pretty sure misses with...

01:02:52.673 --> 01:02:53.506
16.

01:02:54.715 --> 01:02:55.582
MATT: 16 misses.

01:02:55.582 --> 01:02:58.003
(panting)

01:02:58.003 --> 01:03:00.929
MARISHA: And that's-- okay, another nine damage.

01:03:00.929 --> 01:03:04.186
MATT: Another nine damage, you got it.

01:03:04.186 --> 01:03:06.389
MARISHA: First off, Extract Aspects.

01:03:06.389 --> 01:03:08.239
MATT: All righty.

01:03:08.239 --> 01:03:11.630
Which means it is marked by you as analyzed.

01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:14.246
And it is...

01:03:14.246 --> 01:03:16.810
immune to cold damage.

01:03:16.810 --> 01:03:18.284
MARISHA: That's it?
MATT: That's it.

01:03:18.284 --> 01:03:19.636
MARISHA: Okay, yep.
SAM: Okay, okay, okay.

01:03:19.636 --> 01:03:21.020
MARISHA: Immune to cold.
SAM: We can work with that.

01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:22.651
MARISHA: Immune to cold, everybody.

01:03:22.651 --> 01:03:23.980
TALIESIN: Just normal, is everything else?

01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:26.422
MARISHA: And then--
MATT: Seems to be.

01:03:26.422 --> 01:03:28.563
MARISHA: -- Stunning Strike again with that last pop pop.

01:03:28.563 --> 01:03:31.243
MATT: Okay, that does succeed.

01:03:32.798 --> 01:03:33.922
30.

01:03:33.922 --> 01:03:34.755
MARISHA: 30?

01:03:34.755 --> 01:03:36.156
MATT: Yeah.

01:03:36.156 --> 01:03:38.048
MARISHA: Great, good.

01:03:39.331 --> 01:03:41.818
That's my turn, I think.

01:03:41.818 --> 01:03:42.953
SAM: That's a lot.
MATT: And Jester, anything else

01:03:42.953 --> 01:03:43.786
in your turn or is that--

01:03:43.786 --> 01:03:45.825
LAURA: For my bonus, I'm going to just--

01:03:45.825 --> 01:03:50.825
are there any spikes sticking out of the back or anything?

01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:52.769
MATT: I mean, there are heavier scales.

01:03:52.769 --> 01:03:54.427
There aren't any giant spikes or anything.

01:03:54.427 --> 01:03:58.277
You can grab onto scale elements and parts of the skin.

01:03:58.277 --> 01:04:00.269
But that's what you got.

01:04:00.269 --> 01:04:02.390
LAURA: What about the wing?

01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:04.195
Is that a good thing to hold onto?

01:04:04.195 --> 01:04:05.168
MATT: You can certainly try.
LAURA: I want to use my bonus action

01:04:05.168 --> 01:04:08.043
to try to grab on and get as much of a hold,

01:04:08.043 --> 01:04:10.915
so it doesn't throw me off its back, as possible.

01:04:10.915 --> 01:04:14.343
MATT: Sure, okay, you do your best to grab ahold.

01:04:14.343 --> 01:04:15.427
That finishes your guys' turns?

01:04:15.427 --> 01:04:16.260
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:17.661
MATT: End of your turn, it's going to go ahead and use

01:04:17.661 --> 01:04:20.755
two of its legendary actions to do its wing attack

01:04:20.755 --> 01:04:22.197
where it begins to beat its wings.

01:04:22.197 --> 01:04:23.892
You watch it-- (whooshing)

01:04:23.892 --> 01:04:26.117
start swinging its wings causing all this wind and snow

01:04:26.117 --> 01:04:27.448
begin to swirl around it.

01:04:27.448 --> 01:04:29.638
All the rest of you watch as suddenly you can't see it.

01:04:29.638 --> 01:04:32.249
It's just caught in this giant torrent of air

01:04:32.249 --> 01:04:34.993
and soft powder snow that's been kicked up around it.

01:04:34.993 --> 01:04:36.380
You both are being battered with it.

01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:38.374
Your skin is starting to just freeze on impact.

01:04:38.374 --> 01:04:39.824
I need both of you--

01:04:39.824 --> 01:04:40.657
SAM: Uh-oh.

01:04:42.148 --> 01:04:45.777
MATT: Make a dexterity saving throw for me, please.

01:04:45.777 --> 01:04:47.951
MARISHA: And we got advantage on the, ooh, fuck!
LAURA: We do?

01:04:47.951 --> 01:04:51.006
And I got advantage on the other attacks.

01:04:51.006 --> 01:04:52.181
MATT: You did.

01:04:54.913 --> 01:04:55.830
MARISHA: I missed 'em.

01:04:55.830 --> 01:04:57.663
MATT: Got to remember that.

01:04:58.686 --> 01:05:00.913
MARISHA: Yeah, 29.

01:05:00.913 --> 01:05:02.080
MATT: 29, success.

01:05:04.622 --> 01:05:05.986
LAURA: 23.

01:05:05.986 --> 01:05:07.587
MATT: 23, failure.

01:05:07.587 --> 01:05:09.173
SAM: Oof.

01:05:09.173 --> 01:05:10.753
MATT: So you take--
LIAM: 23 failure?

01:05:10.753 --> 01:05:14.394
MATT: -- 16 points of bludgeoning damage,

01:05:14.394 --> 01:05:16.745
TRAVIS: One-six or six-zero?

01:05:16.745 --> 01:05:17.612
MATT: Hm?
TRAVIS: 16?

01:05:17.612 --> 01:05:19.655
MATT: 16 points of bludgeoning damage.

01:05:19.655 --> 01:05:20.488
LAURA: Okay.

01:05:20.488 --> 01:05:22.567
MATT: You take eight, Beauregard.
MARISHA: All right.

01:05:22.567 --> 01:05:24.600
LAURA: 23's a failure?!

01:05:25.850 --> 01:05:27.675
This is-- we're fucked.

01:05:27.675 --> 01:05:28.508
TRAVIS: Nuh-uh.

01:05:28.508 --> 01:05:30.257
LAURA: This is ancient.
SAM: No, <i>you're</i> fucked. You're fucked.

01:05:30.257 --> 01:05:33.444
MATT: Jester, you knocked prone
from the impact from failing your save,

01:05:33.444 --> 01:05:34.759
and (whooshing) tumble down

01:05:34.759 --> 01:05:37.519
and land prone onto the ground beneath the dragon.

01:05:37.519 --> 01:05:40.450
LIAM: It's okay, you're just by its tail.

01:05:40.450 --> 01:05:43.186
LAURA: So that bonus action was for naught?

01:05:43.186 --> 01:05:44.928
MATT: Because of the failed save, unfortunately, yes.

01:05:44.928 --> 01:05:46.440
You do manage to hold on, Beauregard.

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:48.239
MARISHA: Oh-okay.

01:05:48.239 --> 01:05:50.309
MATT: That finishes your turn.
LAURA: Cool.

01:05:50.309 --> 01:05:53.479
MATT: It is now Gelidon's turn.
TRAVIS: Oh, boy.

01:05:53.479 --> 01:05:54.312
MATT: Huh.

01:05:59.634 --> 01:06:04.634
Gelidon is going to go ahead and rush forward,

01:06:04.655 --> 01:06:06.803
right up to you, Yasha.

01:06:06.803 --> 01:06:08.616
Since you were right there in front of its vision

01:06:08.616 --> 01:06:10.878
after Jester pulls off the back.

01:06:10.878 --> 01:06:12.495
Beau's up on top.

01:06:12.495 --> 01:06:13.774
It's going to go ahead and stumble forward.

01:06:13.774 --> 01:06:15.819
And first it's going to use its frightful presence.

01:06:15.819 --> 01:06:18.619
So I need everybody, and I mean everybody,

01:06:18.619 --> 01:06:22.074
to go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw for me, please.

01:06:22.074 --> 01:06:23.422
MARISHA: With advantage?

01:06:23.422 --> 01:06:24.630
MATT: Yep.
LIAM: Yep, okay.

01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:25.686
With advantage.

01:06:25.686 --> 01:06:26.898
MARISHA: (laughs ruefully)

01:06:26.898 --> 01:06:28.481
I rolled two 11s.

01:06:29.679 --> 01:06:30.642
15.

01:06:30.642 --> 01:06:32.750
LIAM: This is a wisdom save?

01:06:32.750 --> 01:06:34.255
MATT: (laughs) What you got, Ashley?

01:06:34.255 --> 01:06:36.081
ASHLEY: I just rolled two natural 20s.

01:06:36.081 --> 01:06:37.635
(cheering)
MATT: That's amazing!

01:06:37.635 --> 01:06:39.595
ASHLEY: I mean, that's not, like, crazy helpful right now,

01:06:39.595 --> 01:06:40.428
but a little bit.

01:06:40.428 --> 01:06:42.361
LAURA: You really did wonders for her.

01:06:42.361 --> 01:06:44.459
SAM: I did, she's dodeca-healed herself.

01:06:44.459 --> 01:06:45.543
TRAVIS: Don't ever shave that mustache.

01:06:45.543 --> 01:06:46.977
(laughter)

01:06:46.977 --> 01:06:48.715
SAM: We do this with advantage, yes?

01:06:48.715 --> 01:06:50.199
LAURA: Yes.
SAM: 25.

01:06:50.199 --> 01:06:51.855
TRAVIS: 23.

01:06:51.855 --> 01:06:53.165
MATT: 23, success, success.

01:06:53.165 --> 01:06:54.621
LAURA: Wait, that was a success?

01:06:54.621 --> 01:06:55.594
26.

01:06:55.594 --> 01:06:56.427
MATT: Success.

01:06:56.427 --> 01:06:58.093
LIAM: 24.
MATT: Success.

01:06:58.093 --> 01:06:59.393
MATT: Yasha, success. Caduceus?

01:06:59.393 --> 01:07:00.592
TALIESIN: 20.

01:07:00.592 --> 01:07:01.425
MATT: Success.

01:07:01.425 --> 01:07:02.758
Beauregard, 15? Fail.

01:07:02.758 --> 01:07:04.471
You are frightened for the next minute.

01:07:04.471 --> 01:07:05.304
LAURA: No!
LIAM: On its back?

01:07:05.304 --> 01:07:06.137
MATT: On its back.

01:07:06.137 --> 01:07:07.968
MARISHA: (screaming)
MATT: And you're just screaming.

01:07:07.968 --> 01:07:10.027
(laughter)

01:07:10.027 --> 01:07:11.211
TRAVIS: Use the eye!

01:07:11.211 --> 01:07:14.074
LIAM: That's realistic, that's realistic.

01:07:14.074 --> 01:07:15.692
MARISHA: It's okay, I got this guys. I'm a monk.

01:07:15.692 --> 01:07:17.604
MATT: Tyffial is frightened.

01:07:17.604 --> 01:07:19.213
SAM: Wait, monks can be frightened?

01:07:19.213 --> 01:07:21.592
MARISHA: Monks can get rid of frightened for an action.

01:07:21.592 --> 01:07:23.922
ASHLEY: They also have advantage on saving throws.

01:07:23.922 --> 01:07:25.901
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm okay.
MATT: They do, you're right.

01:07:25.901 --> 01:07:27.359
Yeah, no so...

01:07:27.359 --> 01:07:29.234
LAURA: Sweet.

01:07:29.234 --> 01:07:31.863
MATT: Which I should've seen with the marks there.

01:07:32.763 --> 01:07:33.596
Yeah.

01:07:35.472 --> 01:07:37.771
That advantage made a difference to them, too.

01:07:37.771 --> 01:07:39.744
Natural 20. Oh yeah, so yeah,
none of the rest are frightened.

01:07:39.744 --> 01:07:41.385
It's just you, Beau.

01:07:41.385 --> 01:07:44.729
And it's going to unleash a round of attacks on you, Yasha,

01:07:44.729 --> 01:07:45.808
as part of that.

01:07:45.808 --> 01:07:47.107
So...

01:07:47.107 --> 01:07:48.407
ASHLEY: (squeals)

01:07:48.407 --> 01:07:50.523
MATT: Two bite attacks.

01:07:50.523 --> 01:07:53.075
I'm sorry, one bite attack and two with its claws.

01:07:53.075 --> 01:07:55.825
So the bite attack against you is...

01:07:57.339 --> 01:07:58.172
26 to hit.

01:07:59.158 --> 01:08:00.071
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:08:00.071 --> 01:08:01.071
MATT: All right.

01:08:02.244 --> 01:08:03.884
TALIESIN: Going to be a little more rough.

01:08:03.884 --> 01:08:05.571
ASHLEY: It's going to be a little rough, it's okay.

01:08:05.571 --> 01:08:06.404
MATT: That is

01:08:09.538 --> 01:08:12.045
22 points of piercing damage,

01:08:12.045 --> 01:08:13.997
but you are not raging yet, so--

01:08:13.997 --> 01:08:16.097
ASHLEY: I am not, that's right.

01:08:16.097 --> 01:08:16.930
Because I'm an idiot.

01:08:16.930 --> 01:08:17.884
LIAM: Those--

01:08:17.884 --> 01:08:19.654
Those random encounter tables--

01:08:19.654 --> 01:08:21.585
ASHLEY: Boy, oh boy, that would've been so smart to rage.

01:08:21.585 --> 01:08:23.405
MATT: Plus 14 points of cold damage

01:08:23.405 --> 01:08:26.704
as its teeth tear in your chest and pull you back.

01:08:26.704 --> 01:08:27.613
You manage to push away,

01:08:27.613 --> 01:08:30.065
but as it does, the blood that pours free (creaking)

01:08:30.065 --> 01:08:32.482
freezes in place. The cold impact of its teeth

01:08:32.482 --> 01:08:35.264
seems to freeze the wounds that left with them.

01:08:36.382 --> 01:08:37.215
Now it's going to go ahead

01:08:37.215 --> 01:08:38.240
and get two claw strikes against you.

01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:40.940
ASHLEY: So you said 16.

01:08:40.940 --> 01:08:41.896
MATT: And then 14 cold.

01:08:41.896 --> 01:08:42.750
ASHLEY: And then 14, okay.

01:08:42.750 --> 01:08:44.066
SAM: So you're now mind controlled

01:08:44.066 --> 01:08:46.837
because every fight you are mind controlled.

01:08:46.837 --> 01:08:47.670
MATT: 32 to hit.

01:08:47.670 --> 01:08:48.503
SAM: Yeah.

01:08:49.687 --> 01:08:51.695
MATT: So 32 to hit, which I believe hits.

01:08:51.695 --> 01:08:53.028
And a 26 to hit.

01:08:54.103 --> 01:08:55.292
ASHLEY: Oh yeah.

01:08:55.292 --> 01:08:56.407
TALIESIN: Oh no.

01:08:56.407 --> 01:08:57.981
MATT: So you take--

01:08:57.981 --> 01:08:59.263
LAURA: Uh-oh.

01:08:59.263 --> 01:09:01.783
MATT: 13 points of slashing damage.

01:09:01.783 --> 01:09:05.788
Ah, and 19 points of slashing damage.

01:09:05.788 --> 01:09:07.368
ASHLEY: So 14, 16, 13, 19.

01:09:07.368 --> 01:09:08.279
MATT: Correct.

01:09:08.279 --> 01:09:09.112
ASHLEY: Got it.

01:09:09.112 --> 01:09:10.918
(laughter)

01:09:10.918 --> 01:09:11.826
Fuck.

01:09:11.826 --> 01:09:15.069
TALIESIN: How are you?
MARISHA: That's just my banner.

01:09:15.069 --> 01:09:17.614
ASHLEY: Let me add all this.

01:09:17.614 --> 01:09:20.057
MATT: And that's its turn.
TRAVIS: Got to rage.

01:09:20.057 --> 01:09:23.057
ASHLEY: Yeah, that was stupid to not rage.

01:09:23.942 --> 01:09:24.775
MATT: You know what?

01:09:24.775 --> 01:09:25.699
No, it's not done yet.

01:09:25.699 --> 01:09:26.890
It came in and unleashed on you.

01:09:26.890 --> 01:09:29.047
And now it's going to go ahead and (whooshing)

01:09:29.047 --> 01:09:29.880
try and fly up.

01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:31.676
You do get an attack of opportunity against it.

01:09:31.676 --> 01:09:33.139
ASHLEY: Okay, let me take it.

01:09:33.139 --> 01:09:34.106
LAURA: Natural 20!

01:09:34.106 --> 01:09:35.689
ASHLEY: Come on.

01:09:35.689 --> 01:09:36.934
MATT: You do have an advantage because you do--

01:09:36.934 --> 01:09:37.767
TRAVIS: Did you do it?

01:09:37.767 --> 01:09:40.975
ASHLEY: Yes, I fucking just rolled a natural 20.

01:09:40.975 --> 01:09:43.867
MATT: All right, well, it does not take off
because you have Sentinel.

01:09:43.867 --> 01:09:44.942
SAM: It's in the book.

01:09:44.942 --> 01:09:46.490
(laughter)

01:09:46.490 --> 01:09:48.142
That's chapter three, what she just did.

01:09:48.142 --> 01:09:50.003
(laughter)

01:09:50.003 --> 01:09:53.086
ASHLEY: What is happening? Let's go to Vegas.

01:09:53.086 --> 01:09:54.069
Okay.

01:09:55.367 --> 01:09:56.705
What do I do?

01:09:56.705 --> 01:09:57.538
Okay, I know what to do.

01:09:57.538 --> 01:09:59.204
ASHLEY: Take your time, take your time.
ASHLEY: Sorry.

01:09:59.204 --> 01:10:02.405
SAM: Caduceus instinctually cancels the crit.
TRAVIS: Do you get a brutal critical?

01:10:02.405 --> 01:10:03.510
ASHLEY: Yes.

01:10:03.510 --> 01:10:05.666
TRAVIS: Okay, take your time with this.
Make sure you get all your dice.

01:10:05.666 --> 01:10:08.897
TALIESIN: Yeah, because there's a
ton of crazy shit that happens.

01:10:08.897 --> 01:10:10.006
SAM: A ton of crazy shit.

01:10:10.006 --> 01:10:13.415
ASHLEY: "You can roll two additional weapon damage dice

01:10:13.415 --> 01:10:15.048
"when determining the extra damage

01:10:15.048 --> 01:10:16.456
"for a critical hit with a melee attack."

01:10:16.456 --> 01:10:18.492
MATT: Correct, so you roll two addition d6s.
SAM: This is a melee attack, right?

01:10:18.492 --> 01:10:19.625
MATT: Yes.
SAM: This is not a magic thing

01:10:19.625 --> 01:10:22.017
where the 20s do things to, right?

01:10:22.017 --> 01:10:22.940
MATT: No, it's a melee attack.

01:10:22.940 --> 01:10:24.369
SAM: Butterflies aren't going to pop out of her sword?

01:10:24.369 --> 01:10:25.328
Okay, cool.

01:10:25.328 --> 01:10:26.245
LAURA: If only.

01:10:28.421 --> 01:10:29.521
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:10:31.759 --> 01:10:32.808
Okay, so that was 12.

01:10:32.808 --> 01:10:34.143
I'm going to do Savage Attacker

01:10:34.143 --> 01:10:36.802
just to see if I can get some higher.

01:10:36.802 --> 01:10:37.635
Way better.

01:10:37.635 --> 01:10:39.885
(laughter)

01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:44.576
I get two additional.

01:10:44.576 --> 01:10:45.884
LIAM: We're in rare form tonight.

01:10:45.884 --> 01:10:47.467
MATT: Mm-hmm.
TRAVIS: I know.

01:10:48.927 --> 01:10:50.602
LIAM: Ay yi yi.

01:10:50.602 --> 01:10:52.325
TRAVIS: I mean, look, we could've done
the thing where we conjured

01:10:52.325 --> 01:10:54.828
a fake wooly mammoth and had a T-Rex chase it,

01:10:54.828 --> 01:10:57.053
but it's an ancient dragon.

01:10:57.053 --> 01:10:58.782
MARISHA: (chuckles) Yeah.

01:10:58.782 --> 01:11:00.265
ASHLEY: I rolled 20.

01:11:00.265 --> 01:11:01.252
MATT: 20 damage, all right?

01:11:01.252 --> 01:11:06.252
ASHLEY: But that's plus,

01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:07.671
do I add all my stuff?

01:11:07.671 --> 01:11:09.637
MATT: You don't add your rage bonuses
because you're not raging.

01:11:09.637 --> 01:11:11.395
ASHLEY: Not the rage, but savage and radiant?

01:11:11.395 --> 01:11:13.481
MATT: You add your strength bonus.

01:11:13.481 --> 01:11:15.619
ASHLEY: Okay, so that would be--

01:11:15.619 --> 01:11:16.985
MATT: And you add the weapon bonus.

01:11:16.985 --> 01:11:18.008
ASHLEY: 24.

01:11:18.008 --> 01:11:19.823
TALIESIN: Do you do that before or after you double?

01:11:19.823 --> 01:11:21.206
ASHLEY: Yeah, do you do--
MATT: After you double.

01:11:21.206 --> 01:11:23.166
It's the dice doubled and then add the modifier.

01:11:23.166 --> 01:11:25.106
ASHLEY: Okay, so everything would be...

01:11:25.106 --> 01:11:26.914
TALIESIN: 40 plus?

01:11:29.506 --> 01:11:31.082
MATT: So you rolled 20.

01:11:31.082 --> 01:11:31.992
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:11:31.992 --> 01:11:33.259
MATT: So you double the 20 to 40.

01:11:33.259 --> 01:11:34.575
ASHLEY: 40.
MATT: And you add your strength

01:11:34.575 --> 01:11:35.891
modifier and your weapon modifier.

01:11:35.891 --> 01:11:40.108
ASHLEY: Okay, so 40, so 44 and plus

01:11:41.924 --> 01:11:42.876
MATT: One is it?
ASHLEY: Four.

01:11:42.876 --> 01:11:45.208
MATT: It should be just the magic bonus of the weapon,

01:11:45.208 --> 01:11:46.041
which is plus--

01:11:46.041 --> 01:11:47.998
ASHLEY: Oh yeah, okay.

01:11:47.998 --> 01:11:49.015
MATT: So, 45?

01:11:49.015 --> 01:11:50.080
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:53.804
MATT: 45 damage in one strike and holding it to the ground.

01:11:53.804 --> 01:11:55.106
So here's what happens.
MARISHA: Holy shit.

01:11:55.106 --> 01:11:56.556
MATT: It begins to take off (whoosh).

01:11:56.556 --> 01:11:59.341
And you just swing and strike with the blade

01:11:59.341 --> 01:12:02.498
as it carves through its foot, it (grunting).

01:12:02.498 --> 01:12:05.056
"You have a new scent."

01:12:06.677 --> 01:12:07.844
SAM: A new scent?

01:12:11.465 --> 01:12:12.486
TRAVIS: A new scent?

01:12:12.486 --> 01:12:14.054
ASHLEY: A new scent, I think because I'm new,

01:12:14.054 --> 01:12:16.298
because she hasn't met me yet.
MARISHA: She wasn't here before.

01:12:16.298 --> 01:12:18.907
MATT: You weren't there for the original Gelidon experience.

01:12:18.907 --> 01:12:21.372
And seems temporarily intrigued by you.

01:12:21.372 --> 01:12:23.283
The scattering ants that shot around,

01:12:23.283 --> 01:12:24.193
it's not too worried about.

01:12:24.193 --> 01:12:27.095
You're, it's briefly turning an eye to.

01:12:27.095 --> 01:12:27.928
That ends its turn.
SAM: Everybody loves

01:12:27.928 --> 01:12:29.722
fucking Yasha, Jesus!

01:12:29.722 --> 01:12:30.982
(laughter)

01:12:30.982 --> 01:12:32.109
MATT: That brings it to Lucien's turn.

01:12:32.109 --> 01:12:32.942
LAURA: It's that angel blood.

01:12:32.942 --> 01:12:34.328
TRAVIS: Lucien's up after the dragon?

01:12:34.328 --> 01:12:36.341
MATT: Yep.
LAURA: Come on, Lucien!

01:12:37.424 --> 01:12:40.951
ASHLEY: God, why didn't I rage?
MATT: Lucien in the snow just goes like.

01:12:40.951 --> 01:12:42.707
LIAM: Yeah, flex, show us your battle skills, dude.

01:12:42.707 --> 01:12:43.902
MATT: "You could've mentioned that you were being chased

01:12:43.902 --> 01:12:44.852
"by a dragon."

01:12:45.688 --> 01:12:46.696
TALIESIN: Who can remember?

01:12:46.696 --> 01:12:48.498
(laughter)

01:12:48.498 --> 01:12:50.100
TRAVIS: I mentioned the underwater--

01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:53.392
LAURA: What if Lucien comes up in one-punch kills it?

01:12:53.392 --> 01:12:54.260
SAM: That'd be awesome.
TRAVIS: (boom)

01:12:54.260 --> 01:12:55.873
TALIESIN: Then we'd know that we've made the right decision

01:12:55.873 --> 01:12:57.988
the entire time.
TRAVIS: Here's the lodestone, here you go.

01:12:57.988 --> 01:12:59.792
You got it. Go for it.

01:12:59.792 --> 01:13:00.625
LAURA: Bye!
TRAVIS: Thanks for the tattoos!

01:13:00.625 --> 01:13:02.327
MARISHA: We'll go wherever you want to go. Yeah.

01:13:02.327 --> 01:13:05.252
LIAM: We will lip sync with you all you like.

01:13:08.874 --> 01:13:10.540
MATT: Can't quite get to that point.

01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:11.866
ASHLEY: Why didn't I rage?

01:13:11.866 --> 01:13:13.728
SAM: Because you helped all of us.

01:13:13.728 --> 01:13:14.652
ASHLEY: (sighs)
MATT: It's true.

01:13:14.652 --> 01:13:15.976
SAM: You did the right choice.

01:13:15.976 --> 01:13:18.740
Sacrifice yourself for the greater good.

01:13:18.740 --> 01:13:19.627
TALIESIN: How many are you down?

01:13:19.627 --> 01:13:21.266
How many points are you down?

01:13:21.266 --> 01:13:22.274
ASHLEY: I'm not too bad.

01:13:22.274 --> 01:13:23.698
SAM: Yeah, you're fine.

01:13:23.698 --> 01:13:25.381
ASHLEY: Just 63.
SAM: You're surrounded by healers.

01:13:25.381 --> 01:13:27.306
TRAVIS: I did the math.
MARISHA: 63 points.

01:13:27.306 --> 01:13:28.139
LIAM: Oh wow.

01:13:28.139 --> 01:13:30.274
MATT: All right, so he's going to go ahead and pull

01:13:30.274 --> 01:13:31.903
both the scimitars out and as he does,

01:13:31.903 --> 01:13:33.922
run across the front of the clavicle

01:13:33.922 --> 01:13:35.870
and the other one's going to go ahead and,

01:13:35.870 --> 01:13:38.094
we'll just one at the moment, actually, is going to (whoosh)

01:13:38.094 --> 01:13:40.078
carve across and you see it (whoosh)

01:13:40.078 --> 01:13:42.969
ignite with this bright light

01:13:42.969 --> 01:13:44.493
similar to somebody you once knew.

01:13:44.493 --> 01:13:45.571
SAM: Still a blood hunter?

01:13:45.571 --> 01:13:46.852
MARISHA: Still a blood hunter.

01:13:46.852 --> 01:13:48.321
TRAVIS: Claret Order, they all are.

01:13:49.691 --> 01:13:51.829
MATT: Then...
TALIESIN: It's apparently still a thing.

01:13:51.829 --> 01:13:53.291
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:13:53.291 --> 01:13:55.139
LAURA: Oh my god.

01:13:55.139 --> 01:13:57.384
MATT: That's just, just not close enough to get

01:13:57.384 --> 01:14:01.220
into melee with it. So out of frustration,

01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:05.034
he's going to go ahead and hold his action,

01:14:05.034 --> 01:14:08.044
prep and attack for when he can get within range of it.

01:14:08.044 --> 01:14:09.084
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:14:09.084 --> 01:14:10.964
MATT: All right, that finishes Lucien's turn.

01:14:10.964 --> 01:14:12.367
Tyffial's going to go.

01:14:13.754 --> 01:14:14.587
LAURA: Have you gone yet?

01:14:14.587 --> 01:14:16.074
TRAVIS: No.

01:14:16.074 --> 01:14:19.734
MATT: Same thing: can't quite get into melee.

01:14:19.734 --> 01:14:21.861
Is going to go ahead and--

01:14:23.816 --> 01:14:26.004
you know what, he's going to
go ahead use his-- use her action

01:14:26.004 --> 01:14:28.127
to move off to the side here.

01:14:29.274 --> 01:14:31.574
And is going to action surge to go ahead

01:14:31.574 --> 01:14:34.751
after pulling this,

01:14:34.751 --> 01:14:39.751
this long-- this would be a rapier out.

01:14:39.834 --> 01:14:41.084
That has this dark gray,

01:14:41.084 --> 01:14:44.581
almost graphite metallic tinge to it.

01:14:44.581 --> 01:14:45.824
And as she pulls it out,

01:14:45.824 --> 01:14:49.486
you can see she runs this hook across the hand,

01:14:49.486 --> 01:14:51.204
and there's this little splash of blood across the blade,

01:14:51.204 --> 01:14:55.169
as it does, you watch it ignite with a very,

01:14:56.802 --> 01:14:58.674
this would be a black energy,

01:14:58.674 --> 01:15:00.514
almost like it has blackened tendrils,

01:15:00.514 --> 01:15:02.934
similar to what you've seen Fjord utilize

01:15:02.934 --> 01:15:03.767
or summon from magic,

01:15:03.767 --> 01:15:06.444
but it just pulses around the blade.

01:15:06.444 --> 01:15:08.454
And is going to go ahead and make

01:15:08.454 --> 01:15:11.694
attacks against the creature with advantage.

01:15:11.694 --> 01:15:12.527
SAM: Oh!

01:15:13.860 --> 01:15:15.393
MATT: Good thing you gave her advantage.

01:15:17.006 --> 01:15:17.924
SAM: This is Cree?

01:15:17.924 --> 01:15:18.852
MATT: This is Tyffial.

01:15:18.852 --> 01:15:19.685
SAM: Tyffial.

01:15:21.425 --> 01:15:23.734
MATT: One hits.

01:15:23.734 --> 01:15:27.607
Four plus.

01:15:28.955 --> 01:15:31.651
SAM: ? (sings with background music) ?

01:15:31.651 --> 01:15:33.984
MATT: 14 points of damage against Gelidon.

01:15:33.984 --> 01:15:37.212
This is a lot in here to be running at once.

01:15:37.212 --> 01:15:39.624
All right, so that finishes Tyffial's turn.

01:15:39.624 --> 01:15:40.784
Now it is Fjord's go.

01:15:40.784 --> 01:15:41.654
Fjord, what are you doing?

01:15:41.654 --> 01:15:43.554
TRAVIS: How far away is Lucien from--

01:15:43.554 --> 01:15:44.462
MATT: Actually, at the end Tyffial's turn,

01:15:44.462 --> 01:15:47.179
Lucien's going to go ahead and use legendary action.

01:15:47.179 --> 01:15:48.794
SAM: Lucien?
TRAVIS: Lucien or the dragon?

01:15:48.794 --> 01:15:52.034
MATT: Lucien, at the end of Tyffial's turn.
He's going to go ahead spend--

01:15:52.034 --> 01:15:54.418
TALIESIN: We're learning so much.
MATT: -- to tumble.

01:15:54.418 --> 01:15:55.974
MATT: You watch as he kicks off from the stone

01:15:55.974 --> 01:15:58.894
and tumbles in the snow and with his held action,

01:15:58.894 --> 01:16:02.480
manages to move half his movement up to the side and then

01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:04.881
swing across with the blade towards it.

01:16:05.964 --> 01:16:08.111
TRAVIS: That helps [inaudible].

01:16:08.111 --> 01:16:11.474
LIAM: Not just a remote control PC.
MATT: Definitely hits.

01:16:14.172 --> 01:16:16.038
With the branded blade there.

01:16:16.038 --> 01:16:16.871
LIAM: Wow.

01:16:20.084 --> 01:16:22.350
LAURA: Does this mean you guys
are going to get legendary actions?

01:16:22.350 --> 01:16:23.433
Cool!

01:16:23.433 --> 01:16:24.912
SAM: (laughs)

01:16:25.837 --> 01:16:27.572
MARISHA: That would be awesome.

01:16:27.572 --> 01:16:30.797
TALIESIN: What if there were
legendary actions that you didn't control?

01:16:31.634 --> 01:16:35.652
MATT: 22 points of damage against
Gelidon with the one strike.

01:16:35.652 --> 01:16:36.585
LAURA: How many?

01:16:36.585 --> 01:16:40.942
MATT: 22, and the second attack held action.

01:16:40.942 --> 01:16:42.839
Thanks to your advantage is a natural 20.

01:16:42.839 --> 01:16:43.714
LAURA: (cackles)

01:16:43.714 --> 01:16:46.207
TRAVIS: Boom, let's go.

01:16:47.332 --> 01:16:48.190
MATT: Woo!

01:16:51.567 --> 01:16:53.961
TRAVIS: Get it right, add 'em all up.
ASHLEY: Get it right.

01:16:53.961 --> 01:16:55.944
MATT: 34 points of damage on the second strike.

01:16:57.628 --> 01:16:59.684
LIAM: We're watching him dance like Baryshnikov, right now.

01:16:59.684 --> 01:17:02.174
MATT: Yeah, you see him dive into the snow,

01:17:02.174 --> 01:17:04.506
vanish for a second, appear out, strike,

01:17:04.506 --> 01:17:07.504
and with each strike, these burst waves,

01:17:07.504 --> 01:17:08.954
this faint light glow.

01:17:08.954 --> 01:17:10.684
It's different than what you recall on Molly.

01:17:10.684 --> 01:17:12.094
It was more of a radiant light.

01:17:12.094 --> 01:17:13.504
This has like a weird silver shimmer.

01:17:13.504 --> 01:17:15.324
And when it hits, there's this almost

01:17:15.324 --> 01:17:17.044
shockwave effect that happens

01:17:17.044 --> 01:17:21.184
and you see this wincing in the eyes

01:17:21.184 --> 01:17:23.636
of the dragon with each impact.

01:17:23.636 --> 01:17:26.533
That's going to finish Lucien's go on that.

01:17:26.533 --> 01:17:27.838
Fjord, now what are you doing?

01:17:28.963 --> 01:17:31.645
TRAVIS: The Star Razor is going to pulse blue

01:17:31.645 --> 01:17:35.791
and I will fly in towards the dragon.

01:17:35.791 --> 01:17:38.352
As I'm approaching,
once I'm within 30 feet,

01:17:38.352 --> 01:17:41.226
I will extend my hand and Hexblade's Curse.

01:17:41.226 --> 01:17:43.394
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: Against the dragon.

01:17:44.336 --> 01:17:46.554
MATT: Put you about about there.

01:17:46.554 --> 01:17:48.402
TRAVIS: That's only 30 feet from where I was?

01:17:48.402 --> 01:17:50.302
LAURA: Tight.
MATT: Well, that's 30 feet within it.

01:17:50.302 --> 01:17:51.364
TRAVIS: Oh, great, great.

01:17:51.364 --> 01:17:54.169
I'll use my full 60 feet to come around

01:17:54.169 --> 01:17:56.634
on the dragon's left side

01:17:56.634 --> 01:17:58.334
and is there a particular spot

01:17:58.334 --> 01:18:02.121
that I would be able to flank it with Lucien and/or Tyffial?

01:18:02.121 --> 01:18:03.196
MATT: Right there.

01:18:03.196 --> 01:18:05.911
TRAVIS: I'll stay right there within melee range.

01:18:05.911 --> 01:18:07.453
MATT: It is cursed.

01:18:07.453 --> 01:18:11.223
TRAVIS: And I will take two swipes with the Star Razor.

01:18:11.223 --> 01:18:12.189
MATT: Go for it.

01:18:12.189 --> 01:18:13.297
TRAVIS: With advantage.

01:18:17.114 --> 01:18:20.977
Oh, so close. That is 29 to hit.

01:18:21.864 --> 01:18:22.834
MATT: 29 does hit, yeah.

01:18:22.834 --> 01:18:25.674
TRAVIS: Okay, and the second one is--

01:18:26.634 --> 01:18:27.467
Come on, do it.

01:18:29.924 --> 01:18:30.757
Natural 20.

01:18:30.757 --> 01:18:33.506
MATT: Hell yeah, dude! Yeah, get it!

01:18:33.506 --> 01:18:34.833
LAURA: Natural 20s tonight!

01:18:34.833 --> 01:18:38.127
TRAVIS: I will pump a 5th-level Divine Smite in

01:18:38.127 --> 01:18:40.754
on the natural 20, but the first one just hit

01:18:40.754 --> 01:18:43.804
and it is a regular.

01:18:43.804 --> 01:18:47.129
Nine plus eight, 17 plus five is 22

01:18:47.129 --> 01:18:48.234
for the first one.

01:18:48.234 --> 01:18:49.409
MATT: Okay.

01:18:49.409 --> 01:18:51.659
TRAVIS: And the second one is

01:18:53.425 --> 01:18:56.708
eight plus eight is 16.

01:18:56.708 --> 01:18:58.254
SAM: It's because of that mantra.

01:18:58.254 --> 01:19:00.094
We all said that mantra.

01:19:00.094 --> 01:19:01.341
LAURA: Because I laughed during it,

01:19:01.341 --> 01:19:03.122
I didn't get a good roll.
TRAVIS: Five.

01:19:03.122 --> 01:19:05.914
SAM: That's right.
MATT: That paladin crit math.

01:19:05.914 --> 01:19:10.099
TRAVIS: 37, its Divine Smite is-- Help me!

01:19:10.099 --> 01:19:12.013
TALIESIN: (laughs)
LIAM: d8s.

01:19:12.013 --> 01:19:14.904
TRAVIS: Yeah, but it's only 4d8, right?

01:19:14.904 --> 01:19:18.564
Max 5d8 is if it's undead, right?

01:19:18.564 --> 01:19:20.264
MATT: Well, no, it should--

01:19:20.264 --> 01:19:22.635
LIAM: You can scale, right? ? It's been a while. ?

01:19:22.635 --> 01:19:23.468
MATT: Well, it's not undead.

01:19:23.468 --> 01:19:25.904
So you don't get the additional bonus one.

01:19:25.904 --> 01:19:26.737
TRAVIS: Right.

01:19:26.737 --> 01:19:27.934
MATT: But for the paladin,

01:19:27.934 --> 01:19:29.474
if it's a 5th-level spell you used, right?

01:19:29.474 --> 01:19:30.744
TRAVIS: It is.

01:19:30.744 --> 01:19:32.674
MATT: Then that brings it to, if I recall.

01:19:32.674 --> 01:19:34.334
LIAM: Raises depending on the spell level.

01:19:34.334 --> 01:19:35.756
MATT: Yeah, maximum of 5d8.

01:19:35.756 --> 01:19:37.174
So if you do 5th-level, it's 5d8.

01:19:37.174 --> 01:19:38.008
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:19:38.008 --> 01:19:38.841
SAM: Ooh!

01:19:40.767 --> 01:19:41.600
TRAVIS: Nice!

01:19:42.874 --> 01:19:45.024
30, 60.

01:19:45.024 --> 01:19:46.274
LIAM: Should be a big hit.

01:19:46.274 --> 01:19:48.104
TRAVIS: 65 points of damage,

01:19:50.152 --> 01:19:52.694
and because it's a crit, I roll one more

01:19:52.694 --> 01:19:56.041
damage dice on the--
LIAM: Pala, pala, pala, paladin, yo.

01:19:59.034 --> 01:20:00.484
TRAVIS: Plus four.

01:20:00.484 --> 01:20:01.804
MATT: All right, there you go.

01:20:01.804 --> 01:20:04.354
So that brings a total of 69 damage.

01:20:04.354 --> 01:20:06.009
SAM: Yeah!
MATT: Nice.

01:20:07.559 --> 01:20:09.511
SAM: (whispering) That's a sex thing.

01:20:09.511 --> 01:20:10.344
MATT: Do you finish your turn, Fjord?

01:20:11.611 --> 01:20:14.686
TRAVIS: That's 106 total; that's great.

01:20:14.686 --> 01:20:17.944
Yes, yes, he's cursed.

01:20:17.944 --> 01:20:19.034
MATT: Okay, you got it.

01:20:19.034 --> 01:20:20.930
MARISHA: Fjord and Yasha got this, we don't...

01:20:20.930 --> 01:20:24.611
TRAVIS: Does Divine Smite cancel out
a concentration Fly spell?

01:20:24.611 --> 01:20:26.074
MATT: No, it's not a concentration.

01:20:26.074 --> 01:20:26.907
TRAVIS: Okay, cool.

01:20:27.964 --> 01:20:30.644
MATT: All right, that finishes there. It is now Otis' turn.

01:20:30.644 --> 01:20:33.154
Otis is going to go ahead move.

01:20:33.154 --> 01:20:34.191
TRAVIS: Thank you, Yasha.

01:20:35.167 --> 01:20:36.794
MARISHA: Is Otis the halfling?
MATT: Yeah.

01:20:36.794 --> 01:20:40.311
SAM: Otis is the halfling I'm
perpetually trying to kill, yeah.

01:20:40.311 --> 01:20:42.274
MATT: Spend his turn running around the backside of it--

01:20:42.274 --> 01:20:44.114
LIAM: -- can blame it on the dragon.

01:20:44.114 --> 01:20:45.924
MATT: -- trying to essentially swarm around

01:20:45.924 --> 01:20:47.104
as you guys are swarming around.

01:20:47.104 --> 01:20:48.981
That's going to be Otis' turn.
MARISHA: Oh, shit!

01:20:48.981 --> 01:20:51.148
You were just in my way.
MATT: Zoran's going to go.

01:20:52.934 --> 01:20:54.595
SAM: Guys, I shot Otis in the face.

01:20:54.595 --> 01:20:56.710
MATT: Zoran's going to rush there.

01:20:56.710 --> 01:20:58.014
But he used his action to get there, too,

01:20:58.014 --> 01:20:58.847
to get into melee.

01:20:58.847 --> 01:21:01.078
But you watch as Otis rushes behind,

01:21:01.078 --> 01:21:03.878
you can see Otis ends up

01:21:03.878 --> 01:21:06.061
pulling a bolt out of the pack

01:21:06.061 --> 01:21:07.824
and has a crossbow ready.

01:21:07.824 --> 01:21:09.204
And on the crossbow, you can see,

01:21:09.204 --> 01:21:11.810
there's a little point on the handle.

01:21:11.810 --> 01:21:14.685
Like a thumbtack that he presses his thumb into

01:21:14.685 --> 01:21:17.044
and as he pulls back, all of a sudden, you see this

01:21:17.044 --> 01:21:18.878
purplish energy begin to

01:21:18.878 --> 01:21:20.439
pulse and scatter throughout the crossbow

01:21:20.439 --> 01:21:21.634
SAM: They're all blood hunters?

01:21:21.634 --> 01:21:24.127
TRAVIS: It's preview night, kids. It's preview night.

01:21:24.127 --> 01:21:26.096
MARISHA: Yeah, it is.

01:21:26.096 --> 01:21:28.159
LIAM: Now that guy cannot play video games.

01:21:28.159 --> 01:21:29.425
(laughter)

01:21:29.425 --> 01:21:30.970
TRAVIS: Ow, ow, ow, ow!

01:21:30.970 --> 01:21:32.354
MATT: He has to rest for a while after.

01:21:32.354 --> 01:21:33.814
TRAVIS: Press square rapidly.

01:21:33.814 --> 01:21:34.733
No.
LAURA: No.

01:21:34.733 --> 01:21:36.141
(laughter)

01:21:36.141 --> 01:21:37.129
TALIESIN: Remember he has advantage.

01:21:37.129 --> 01:21:38.137
MATT: Yeah.

01:21:38.137 --> 01:21:39.403
TALIESIN: Or does he have--
ASHLEY: Otis does not.

01:21:39.403 --> 01:21:40.811
TALIESIN: Otis does not, never mind.

01:21:40.811 --> 01:21:42.201
MATT: Otis did not attack.

01:21:42.201 --> 01:21:44.504
They both had to use their actions to get into place.

01:21:44.504 --> 01:21:45.337
TALIESIN: Oh, fair.

01:21:46.592 --> 01:21:48.209
MATT: But you see Zoran,

01:21:48.209 --> 01:21:50.974
it was in the pack, pulls out this large, two-handed hammer,

01:21:50.974 --> 01:21:53.792
this maul and runs around the side.

01:21:53.792 --> 01:21:56.214
As he does, you can see he runs his hand along the edge.

01:21:56.214 --> 01:21:58.764
There's these cheese grater-like spikes on one side

01:21:58.764 --> 01:22:02.547
and he goes (whooshing) you see this red spray across it,

01:22:02.547 --> 01:22:05.564
and wherever it sprays, flames emerge from it.

01:22:05.564 --> 01:22:08.444
Now it's this flaming head and handle of a maul

01:22:08.444 --> 01:22:09.719
as he runs up to the side of the dragon,

01:22:09.719 --> 01:22:12.935
just going (roaring) with this big roar.

01:22:12.935 --> 01:22:14.445
That's going to get them both there.

01:22:14.445 --> 01:22:17.039
Caduceus, you're up, with Cree on deck.

01:22:17.039 --> 01:22:20.924
TALIESIN: Okay, I can't see where I am.

01:22:20.924 --> 01:22:21.757
MATT: You're over here.

01:22:21.757 --> 01:22:22.773
TRAVIS: For the people--
TALIESIN: I'm over there.

01:22:22.773 --> 01:22:24.714
TRAVIS: Could you point again with your finger who is who?

01:22:24.714 --> 01:22:25.751
Is Zoran--?

01:22:25.751 --> 01:22:27.423
MATT: Zoran is over here.
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:22:27.423 --> 01:22:28.742
MATT: This is Otis.
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:22:28.742 --> 01:22:30.360
MATT: That's Tyffial. That's Lucien.

01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:32.285
TALIESIN: Who's standing next to me?

01:22:32.285 --> 01:22:33.734
MATT: Next to you is Cree.

01:22:33.734 --> 01:22:36.994
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to--

01:22:36.994 --> 01:22:38.644
I'm going to be dull for this round.

01:22:38.644 --> 01:22:41.689
I'm going to circle around

01:22:41.689 --> 01:22:44.894
to the other side of the block,

01:22:44.894 --> 01:22:47.134
still hiding from the dragon.

01:22:47.134 --> 01:22:49.425
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Sort of towards you.

01:22:49.425 --> 01:22:50.833
MATT: Around here?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:22:50.833 --> 01:22:51.983
MATT: Okay.

01:22:51.983 --> 01:22:55.114
TALIESIN: A little-- How close am I?

01:22:55.114 --> 01:22:56.520
Am I within 30 feet? Well, that doesn't--

01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:58.653
MATT: You are--

01:22:58.653 --> 01:22:59.486
You're not at--

01:22:59.486 --> 01:23:02.424
It is at about 35 or so feet from you at the moment.

01:23:02.424 --> 01:23:03.715
TALIESIN: Okay, for the moment.

01:23:03.715 --> 01:23:04.740
I've got some good shit coming up,

01:23:04.740 --> 01:23:06.576
but for the moment, I am just doing

01:23:06.576 --> 01:23:09.353
Protection from Energy: cold, just to--

01:23:09.353 --> 01:23:10.256
MATT: On yourself?

01:23:10.256 --> 01:23:11.756
TALIESIN: Just to prepare for some crazy shit.

01:23:11.756 --> 01:23:13.274
MATT: You got it, good call.

01:23:13.274 --> 01:23:15.334
TALIESIN: And take my bonus action,

01:23:15.334 --> 01:23:17.104
I suppose, to hide, if that's possible.

01:23:17.104 --> 01:23:18.344
MATT: You can't hide as a bonus action.

01:23:18.344 --> 01:23:19.724
That's a rogue thing, unfortunately.

01:23:19.724 --> 01:23:21.094
TALIESIN: That's all right, I don't know how that works.

01:23:21.094 --> 01:23:22.573
MATT: You crouch a little lower.

01:23:22.573 --> 01:23:23.512
TRAVIS: (laughs)

01:23:23.512 --> 01:23:26.395
TALIESIN: I'm still huge, so it's
just like an entire person.

01:23:26.395 --> 01:23:27.556
MATT: And you're just like--

01:23:27.556 --> 01:23:29.681
TALIESIN: As long as I have some cover,
I'll take some cover,

01:23:29.681 --> 01:23:31.084
whatever cover I can get from the dragon.
MATT: You have some cover...

01:23:31.084 --> 01:23:32.834
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm good.
MATT: For whatever purpose that may serve.

01:23:32.834 --> 01:23:33.761
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:23:33.761 --> 01:23:35.341
MATT: (laughs)

01:23:35.341 --> 01:23:38.895
All righty, and that brings us to Cree's go.

01:23:40.334 --> 01:23:44.177
Cree-- Juggling some stuff here; my apologies for the delay.

01:23:45.064 --> 01:23:46.730
There we go, there's Cree.

01:23:48.415 --> 01:23:52.204
TRAVIS: It's okay. You're only
a dragon and five other fighters.

01:23:53.294 --> 01:23:54.934
MATT: Cree, as you're all standing there

01:23:54.934 --> 01:23:57.356
in the center of the space attacking it.
MARISHA: He is an adventuring party.

01:23:57.356 --> 01:23:58.498
(laughter)

01:23:58.498 --> 01:23:59.652
MATT: Yeah.
MARISHA: And the dragon.

01:23:59.652 --> 01:24:02.317
TRAVIS: You're doing great. You're doing great.

01:24:02.317 --> 01:24:03.625
MATT: All right.

01:24:03.625 --> 01:24:05.644
LIAM: Two beings with legendary actions.

01:24:05.644 --> 01:24:07.584
ASHLEY: He's like a D&amp;D--

01:24:07.584 --> 01:24:09.176
TRAVIS: We did bring a goristro.

01:24:09.176 --> 01:24:11.509
LAURA: I know! Dude, we did. (laughs)

01:24:13.049 --> 01:24:15.537
ASHLEY: You're like Bobby Fischer over there, but for D&amp;D.

01:24:15.537 --> 01:24:18.433
Where you're playing the party and the dragon.

01:24:18.433 --> 01:24:19.266
That was dumb.

01:24:19.266 --> 01:24:20.823
TALIESIN: No, I was with you.

01:24:20.823 --> 01:24:22.572
ASHLEY: There was a better way to--
LIAM: Dragon fight.

01:24:22.572 --> 01:24:25.747
MATT: So you watch as Cree sneaks up beside you,

01:24:27.033 --> 01:24:32.033
off to the side, and goes, "Good
call to bring a shield from ice.

01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:34.124
I like to bring its enemy."

01:24:34.124 --> 01:24:35.524
And you see, she brings her hands down,

01:24:35.524 --> 01:24:37.565
that little bobble of red that's dangling her throat

01:24:37.565 --> 01:24:39.913
glows brightly. She brings her hands up

01:24:39.913 --> 01:24:41.664
(groans) and all of you in the center feel

01:24:41.664 --> 01:24:44.360
this sudden flash of warmth

01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:46.431
as this column of fire begins to

01:24:46.431 --> 01:24:50.781
(roaring) burn like a spiral around Gelidon.

01:24:50.781 --> 01:24:55.254
Gelidon (roars) pulls back as you watch this firestorm erupt

01:24:55.254 --> 01:24:56.533
around the dragon.

01:24:56.533 --> 01:24:58.891
MARISHA: (whimpering scream)

01:24:58.891 --> 01:24:59.724
SAM: Oh no.

01:24:59.724 --> 01:25:01.446
MARISHA: (yells)
(laughter)

01:25:01.446 --> 01:25:04.287
LIAM: Just got worse.
MARISHA: (crying) Just real bad.

01:25:04.287 --> 01:25:06.426
MATT: She fails her save.

01:25:06.426 --> 01:25:09.647
That's going to be 7d10 fire damage.

01:25:09.647 --> 01:25:11.188
TRAVIS: 7d10!

01:25:13.414 --> 01:25:14.247
LAURA: That's...

01:25:15.604 --> 01:25:17.184
SAM: To the dragon?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:25:17.184 --> 01:25:18.471
SAM: Fire?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:25:18.471 --> 01:25:19.612
SAM: Is that going to hurt Beau?

01:25:19.612 --> 01:25:21.869
LAURA: Is that Fire Storm?

01:25:21.869 --> 01:25:23.324
MATT: It is Fire Storm.

01:25:23.324 --> 01:25:24.804
It's doing a spiral column upward.

01:25:24.804 --> 01:25:26.724
TALIESIN: Oh, so all good.

01:25:26.724 --> 01:25:29.433
SAM: Is Beau okay?
MARISHA: Don't hit me, please.

01:25:29.433 --> 01:25:31.411
MATT: Beau, I need you to make a dexterity saving throw.

01:25:31.411 --> 01:25:34.905
MARISHA: Okay, this is considered evasion?

01:25:34.905 --> 01:25:36.970
TRAVIS: Use the ki point.
MATT: It would be.

01:25:38.028 --> 01:25:39.344
MARISHA: I do still have, I do still have--

01:25:39.344 --> 01:25:40.734
MATT: 49 points of fire damage to the dragon.

01:25:40.734 --> 01:25:41.567
MARISHA: -- advantage.

01:25:41.567 --> 01:25:42.514
TRAVIS: 49 point?
MATT: Yeah.

01:25:42.514 --> 01:25:43.534
LIAM: Hoo.

01:25:43.534 --> 01:25:45.254
MARISHA: Thank god I have advantage

01:25:45.254 --> 01:25:47.321
still, because one of those was natural one.

01:25:47.321 --> 01:25:49.190
MATT: Well, you would not have advantage--

01:25:49.190 --> 01:25:50.533
no, you would because it hasn't gone back to her.

01:25:50.533 --> 01:25:52.783
So yeah, you would.
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:25:52.783 --> 01:25:54.654
You said dex saving throw, right?

01:25:54.654 --> 01:25:55.487
MATT: Correct.

01:25:55.487 --> 01:25:56.664
MARISHA: 23?
LIAM: Cat on a hot tin roof.

01:25:56.664 --> 01:25:58.361
MATT: 23 is a success.
MARISHA: Great.

01:25:58.361 --> 01:26:02.066
MATT: So you take 24 points of fire damage.

01:26:02.066 --> 01:26:03.789
MARISHA: If it's success, I take no damage.

01:26:03.789 --> 01:26:05.474
MATT: Ah, but you have advantage-- I mean, you have evasion.

01:26:05.474 --> 01:26:08.824
So yeah, so you actually-- you
cling to the side of the dragon

01:26:08.824 --> 01:26:12.714
and the heat coasts over you. You feel it and it hurts,

01:26:12.714 --> 01:26:15.162
but not enough to actually leave damage on your body.

01:26:15.162 --> 01:26:17.634
Yeah, it's like a platformer. I
scale to one side of the dragon

01:26:17.634 --> 01:26:19.818
and then I scale to the other side of the dragon,

01:26:19.818 --> 01:26:21.841
as it columns up.

01:26:21.841 --> 01:26:23.294
MATT: Your little grip icon is

01:26:23.294 --> 01:26:25.866
getting slower and slower.
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:26:25.866 --> 01:26:26.991
MATT: Perfect, perfect.
LAURA: You can do one

01:26:26.991 --> 01:26:29.624
of those evasions per your turn?

01:26:29.624 --> 01:26:31.039
MATT: Just whenever she makes a save.

01:26:31.039 --> 01:26:32.986
It's just-- it's an ability.

01:26:32.986 --> 01:26:34.254
But only dexterity saves.

01:26:34.254 --> 01:26:35.574
LAURA: Okay, okay.

01:26:35.574 --> 01:26:39.274
MATT: That finishes that go for Cree.

01:26:39.274 --> 01:26:40.624
Caleb, you're up.

01:26:40.624 --> 01:26:42.183
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: With Veth on deck.

01:26:42.183 --> 01:26:43.864
LIAM: Couple of things, one Caleb is not in the air

01:26:43.864 --> 01:26:46.224
because those boots are only good for one turn.

01:26:46.224 --> 01:26:48.564
So if they're off and I'm in the air I crash.

01:26:48.564 --> 01:26:50.584
So I would have landed already.

01:26:50.584 --> 01:26:51.417
MATT: Okay.

01:26:51.417 --> 01:26:55.634
LIAM: And I think I'm not on that picture there.

01:26:55.634 --> 01:26:59.255
I'm going to start moving up the side of that map,

01:26:59.255 --> 01:27:02.374
but not right along the edge of it.

01:27:02.374 --> 01:27:03.582
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: Keeping in that arc?

01:27:03.582 --> 01:27:06.724
LIAM: Yeah, on the ground, though, in the snow.

01:27:06.724 --> 01:27:07.557
MATT: Okay.

01:27:07.557 --> 01:27:09.554
LIAM: Saying ? he's going for distance, ?

01:27:09.554 --> 01:27:13.319
? he's going for speed ? and I ?
will rub molasses down my hand.

01:27:13.319 --> 01:27:16.394
? He's all alone in that time of need ?

01:27:16.394 --> 01:27:19.184
and I will cast slow on Gelidon.

01:27:19.184 --> 01:27:20.354
MATT: Okay.

01:27:20.354 --> 01:27:22.054
LIAM: So wisdom save for Gelidon.

01:27:22.054 --> 01:27:23.990
MATT: Wisdom save from Gelidon.

01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:26.506
TRAVIS: [inaudible]

01:27:26.506 --> 01:27:28.454
MATT: That is an 18 exactly.

01:27:28.454 --> 01:27:30.302
LIAM: (groans) Okay.

01:27:30.302 --> 01:27:32.260
MATT: Good call, though.
LIAM: Yeah.

01:27:32.260 --> 01:27:33.901
MATT: All right, is that your turn?

01:27:33.901 --> 01:27:34.734
LIAM: Yeah, that's it.

01:27:34.734 --> 01:27:36.674
MATT: Veth, you're up. Yasha, you're on deck.

01:27:36.674 --> 01:27:38.964
Actually, at the end of your turn, Caleb,

01:27:38.964 --> 01:27:41.282
Gelidon, who's now been burned and angrily--

01:27:41.282 --> 01:27:44.025
is after the impact that left on the heavy back,

01:27:44.025 --> 01:27:45.254
since you're in that direction is going to go ahead

01:27:45.254 --> 01:27:48.935
and use one of its legendary actions to tail swipe you.

01:27:48.935 --> 01:27:49.768
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:27:49.768 --> 01:27:51.842
MARISHA: Could I get a Sentinel attack on him?

01:27:52.726 --> 01:27:53.894
MATT: You could, yeah.

01:27:53.894 --> 01:27:55.153
Yeah, if you still have a reaction.

01:27:55.153 --> 01:27:56.361
MARISHA: I do.

01:27:56.361 --> 01:27:57.856
MATT: That is a natural 20.

01:27:57.856 --> 01:28:00.026
TALIESIN: Am I within 30 feet?

01:28:00.026 --> 01:28:01.928
MATT: You are not. You are 35 feet.

01:28:01.928 --> 01:28:04.855
SAM: He read my book. <i>She</i> read my book.

01:28:04.855 --> 01:28:07.076
(laughter)

01:28:07.076 --> 01:28:09.271
MARISHA: Big negative for me.

01:28:09.271 --> 01:28:10.544
MATT: You missed?
MARISHA: Miss.

01:28:10.544 --> 01:28:12.774
TALIESIN: Even with the bonus, even with advantage?

01:28:12.774 --> 01:28:15.371
MARISHA: I'm technically frightened, so I have disadvantage,

01:28:15.371 --> 01:28:18.411
so it evens out and I rolled a three.

01:28:18.411 --> 01:28:19.244
MATT: Okay, that is--

01:28:19.244 --> 01:28:21.943
TRAVIS: Let's just see how Armor of Hexes works.

01:28:21.943 --> 01:28:25.103
MATT: -- 29 points of bludgeoning damage as the tail

01:28:25.103 --> 01:28:27.464
(whoosh) swings towards you like a tree trunk

01:28:27.464 --> 01:28:28.994
being sped in your direction.

01:28:28.994 --> 01:28:31.504
TRAVIS: So he is under my Hexblade's Curse.

01:28:31.504 --> 01:28:33.421
MATT: Correct.
TRAVIS: She, sorry. Thank you.

01:28:33.421 --> 01:28:37.482
So on an attack roll, I roll a d6 and a four or higher,

01:28:37.482 --> 01:28:40.805
she misses with a six.

01:28:40.805 --> 01:28:43.114
MATT: Did you just roll a six? Yeah, you did!

01:28:43.114 --> 01:28:46.206
You just quickly fly up out of the way.

01:28:46.206 --> 01:28:48.068
TRAVIS: There's a plan to this recipe, motherfucker.

01:28:48.068 --> 01:28:50.408
MATT: The tail still comes towards you

01:28:50.408 --> 01:28:52.684
and just at that point, you see the shadows

01:28:52.684 --> 01:28:54.928
from that faint shadow curse around,

01:28:54.928 --> 01:28:58.734
reach out like ropes and yank the tail just wide

01:28:58.734 --> 01:29:01.744
as you pull up underneath, it taps your toes

01:29:01.744 --> 01:29:03.094
and you can sense that would

01:29:03.094 --> 01:29:04.524
have been awful, had it impacted.

01:29:04.524 --> 01:29:06.364
LAURA: You just hear me from behind you laying

01:29:06.364 --> 01:29:07.910
in the snow go: Woo!

01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:11.075
(laughter)

01:29:11.075 --> 01:29:12.904
MATT: All right, Veth, now it's your go.

01:29:12.904 --> 01:29:16.562
SAM: Okay, I'll keep circling
in a counterclockwise direction.

01:29:17.620 --> 01:29:21.446
As I'm running, I'll cast another one of those spells,

01:29:21.446 --> 01:29:24.013
Voltaic Bolt. Charge up another one.

01:29:24.013 --> 01:29:24.846
MATT: You got it.

01:29:24.846 --> 01:29:28.765
SAM: And skid in the snow and fire off that bolt.

01:29:28.765 --> 01:29:32.551
MATT: (whoosh) Spraying up as you slide into home base,

01:29:32.551 --> 01:29:34.735
SAM: 24 to hit.
MATT: That hits.

01:29:36.252 --> 01:29:39.135
SAM: And since I get--

01:29:39.135 --> 01:29:42.437
wait, I'm attacking with advantage, right, still?

01:29:42.437 --> 01:29:43.579
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:29:43.579 --> 01:29:46.312
SAM: Okay. Well, still say same roll

01:29:46.312 --> 01:29:47.824
but I get sneak attack damage

01:29:47.824 --> 01:29:50.854
because she's engaged with my friends?

01:29:50.854 --> 01:29:51.877
MATT: You do.
SAM: Okay, cool.

01:29:51.877 --> 01:29:53.594
MATT: She's very engaged with your friends.

01:29:53.594 --> 01:29:56.172
She is swarmed by your friends.

01:29:56.172 --> 01:29:58.322
SAM: Okay, okay, okay.

01:30:06.870 --> 01:30:10.745
SAM: 35 plus another 14

01:30:10.745 --> 01:30:12.832
is 49 points of damage.

01:30:12.832 --> 01:30:14.248
MATT: Woo hoo!

01:30:15.184 --> 01:30:16.026
TALIESIN: Taking chunks.

01:30:16.026 --> 01:30:17.574
TRAVIS: Look at the lone mini out here

01:30:17.574 --> 01:30:18.747
in this camera angle.

01:30:18.747 --> 01:30:21.565
(laughter)
MATT: Yep. Yep.

01:30:21.565 --> 01:30:23.686
ASHLEY: That's a hero shot.
TALIESIN: That's a book cover.

01:30:23.686 --> 01:30:26.061
TRAVIS: (whoosh) (explosion sound)

01:30:26.061 --> 01:30:27.242
SAM: That's all I got.

01:30:27.242 --> 01:30:30.424
MATT: All righty. Finishing your go. Yasha, you're up.

01:30:30.424 --> 01:30:31.857
LIAM: Wow.
ASHLEY: Okay,

01:30:33.444 --> 01:30:36.676
I'm going to let out a scream of rage.

01:30:36.676 --> 01:30:37.851
TRAVIS: (growls)
SAM: Yeah!

01:30:38.908 --> 01:30:42.077
ASHLEY: And I'm going to take an attack.

01:30:42.077 --> 01:30:42.992
MATT: Do it.

01:30:45.409 --> 01:30:48.951
ASHLEY: Ooh, it's a natural 19.

01:30:48.951 --> 01:30:52.474
So plus nine, that's 28.

01:30:52.474 --> 01:30:53.724
MATT: That definitely hits.

01:30:53.724 --> 01:30:54.557
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:30:54.557 --> 01:30:56.516
SAM: You got us into this Yasha, get us out.

01:30:56.516 --> 01:30:58.886
ASHLEY: I'm going to do my bestest.

01:30:58.886 --> 01:31:02.391
TALIESIN: I feel Travis is really
dodging a lot of-- (laughs)

01:31:02.391 --> 01:31:03.666
a lot of blame here.
LAURA: I know!

01:31:03.666 --> 01:31:04.499
TALIESIN: I'm just saying.

01:31:04.499 --> 01:31:05.958
(laughter)

01:31:05.958 --> 01:31:08.472
TALIESIN: You keep smiling every time that happens.
TRAVIS: I'll take all of it.

01:31:08.472 --> 01:31:10.711
(laughter)

01:31:10.711 --> 01:31:12.669
TALIESIN: I'm going to try a brand new spell.

01:31:13.694 --> 01:31:15.974
ASHLEY: 29 for the first hit.

01:31:15.974 --> 01:31:16.944
MATT: Yeah, that definitely hits.

01:31:16.944 --> 01:31:18.638
ASHLEY: Yeah? Oh, no, that's the damage.

01:31:18.638 --> 01:31:20.281
MATT: That's the damage, I'm sorry, yeah.

01:31:20.281 --> 01:31:24.074
SAM: (pigeon coos) Should we start trying
to kill one of the Tomb Takers?

01:31:24.074 --> 01:31:25.506
TRAVIS: I knew you were going to ask that.

01:31:25.506 --> 01:31:26.740
(laughter)

01:31:26.740 --> 01:31:28.532
SAM: I mean, you're right back there. (coos)

01:31:28.532 --> 01:31:31.934
TRAVIS: I think we have slightly larger concerns.

01:31:31.934 --> 01:31:34.519
SAM: Yeah, but (coos) there's less of other people who could

01:31:34.519 --> 01:31:37.344
(coos) take care of the dragon. (coos)

01:31:37.344 --> 01:31:39.391
LIAM: They see everything. (coos)

01:31:40.776 --> 01:31:43.626
TRAVIS: Two of us are compromised, potentially. (coos)

01:31:43.626 --> 01:31:44.825
(laughter)

01:31:44.825 --> 01:31:46.575
ASHLEY: Okay, 15.

01:31:46.575 --> 01:31:49.299
MATT: 15 misses.
MARISHA: So many fucking pigeons right now!

01:31:49.299 --> 01:31:51.913
MATT: All right, that finishes your go.

01:31:51.913 --> 01:31:53.784
Beau and Jester, you are up.

01:31:53.784 --> 01:31:58.745
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to use
my action to Stillness of Mind.

01:31:58.745 --> 01:32:00.444
I'm going to take a little meditation moment

01:32:00.444 --> 01:32:01.834
on the top of this dragon.

01:32:01.834 --> 01:32:02.667
MATT: And get rid of frightened?

01:32:02.667 --> 01:32:04.934
MARISHA: And get rid of frightened.
MATT: You got it.

01:32:04.934 --> 01:32:08.464
MARISHA: Then I'm going to take my bonus action to pop pop

01:32:08.464 --> 01:32:09.535
and Flurry of Blows.

01:32:09.535 --> 01:32:12.384
MATT: Unfortunately, to make a bonus
attack with your bonus action,

01:32:12.384 --> 01:32:14.394
you have to make the attack action. It can't be separate.

01:32:14.394 --> 01:32:16.827
MARISHA: That's right. I can bonus attack tack, though--

01:32:16.827 --> 01:32:19.551
bonus action attack, right?

01:32:19.551 --> 01:32:20.944
MATT: It has to be technically part of the attack action

01:32:20.944 --> 01:32:22.544
to get the bonus offhand hit,

01:32:22.544 --> 01:32:26.018
I believe-- I will double check. I'm pretty sure.

01:32:26.018 --> 01:32:27.460
ASHLEY: Shit!
TRAVIS: What?

01:32:28.410 --> 01:32:31.025
ASHLEY: I have advantage on attack rolls.

01:32:32.175 --> 01:32:33.374
MATT: You do, go ahead and roll one more time.

01:32:33.374 --> 01:32:34.604
ASHLEY: Let me roll one more time, okay, sorry.

01:32:34.604 --> 01:32:36.300
TRAVIS: It was a 19.

01:32:36.300 --> 01:32:37.133
MATT: It's okay.

01:32:38.654 --> 01:32:39.724
ASHLEY: 24?

01:32:39.724 --> 01:32:41.705
MATT: 24 does hit. Go ahead and roll
damage for that second attack.

01:32:41.705 --> 01:32:42.538
ASHLEY: Okay.
SAM: Yes!

01:32:42.538 --> 01:32:44.144
ASHLEY: Fuck yes.

01:32:44.144 --> 01:32:45.954
MATT: Yeah, if you use the attack
action with an unarmed strike

01:32:45.954 --> 01:32:48.164
or monk weapon, you can make one
unarmed strike as a bonus action.

01:32:48.164 --> 01:32:51.231
So you have to make the attack action to get the bonus.

01:32:51.231 --> 01:32:54.304
TALIESIN: So you can keep the frightened, but no.

01:32:54.304 --> 01:32:55.584
MARISHA: I'm not keep that frightened.

01:32:55.584 --> 01:32:57.607
ASHLEY: 14.
MATT: 14 again? Misses.

01:32:57.607 --> 01:32:58.992
ASHLEY: No, 14 points of damage.
MATT: Oh, 14, yeah, I was like

01:32:58.992 --> 01:33:02.262
wait-- no, we hit it. 14 damage. You got it.

01:33:02.262 --> 01:33:03.528
All righty.

01:33:05.131 --> 01:33:09.756
MARISHA: I will, I guess, then,

01:33:11.064 --> 01:33:13.747
use my bonus action to Patient Defense?

01:33:13.747 --> 01:33:17.894
use my bonus action to Patient Defense?

01:33:17.894 --> 01:33:21.397
MATT: Okay, Patient Defense and Jester, what are you doing?

01:33:21.397 --> 01:33:22.624
SAM: When you're frightened, do you have--

01:33:22.624 --> 01:33:24.854
you just can't get any closer when you're frightened.

01:33:24.854 --> 01:33:26.421
MATT: And all of your attacks are at disadvantage

01:33:26.421 --> 01:33:28.444
while it's in visual sight.
SAM: But you don't have to run away, right?

01:33:28.444 --> 01:33:29.277
MATT: You can't get closer.

01:33:29.277 --> 01:33:30.404
SAM: You just can't get closer.
MATT: Yeah.

01:33:30.404 --> 01:33:31.574
SAM: And she's as close as they get.

01:33:31.574 --> 01:33:32.730
MATT: Yep!
SAM: Okay, cool.

01:33:32.730 --> 01:33:33.563
MATT: (laughs)

01:33:33.563 --> 01:33:36.072
MARISHA: But disadvantage on everything sucks.

01:33:36.072 --> 01:33:39.844
LAURA: I'm going to do the same thing that I saw Cree do

01:33:41.044 --> 01:33:43.067
and I'm going to sit up in the snow.

01:33:43.067 --> 01:33:44.822
SAM: Are you're going to cut yourself?

01:33:44.822 --> 01:33:47.355
LAURA: I'm going to just scratch
my arm really hard and then--

01:33:47.355 --> 01:33:49.213
(laughter)

01:33:49.213 --> 01:33:52.284
and then try to form my Fire Storm into a tornado as well

01:33:52.284 --> 01:33:56.784
and say: Um, duck, Beau! Take cover! (flames crackling)

01:33:56.784 --> 01:33:58.193
MATT: Okay, okay.

01:33:59.679 --> 01:34:01.228
MARISHA: Duck pull--
TRAVIS: (explosion)

01:34:01.228 --> 01:34:02.061
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah.

01:34:02.061 --> 01:34:04.404
(laughter)
MARISHA: Oh god!

01:34:04.404 --> 01:34:05.624
MATT: 18, what's your DC?

01:34:05.624 --> 01:34:06.457
LAURA: 18.

01:34:06.457 --> 01:34:07.774
MATT: Makes the save, so it takes half damage.

01:34:07.774 --> 01:34:08.804
Still hits, though.

01:34:08.804 --> 01:34:11.220
Beau, go ahead and make a dexterity saving throw.

01:34:11.220 --> 01:34:13.384
MARISHA: That's just a straight one, right?

01:34:13.384 --> 01:34:14.514
MATT: Correct, no longer with disadvantage.

01:34:14.514 --> 01:34:16.397
MARISHA: Everything's done? Oh, that's okay, that's okay.

01:34:16.397 --> 01:34:17.534
20 total.

01:34:17.534 --> 01:34:18.609
MATT: I think you succeed, yeah.
LAURA: Good, good.

01:34:18.609 --> 01:34:21.579
MATT: So half fire damage to Gelidon and you from this.

01:34:21.579 --> 01:34:22.545
MARISHA: And me?

01:34:22.545 --> 01:34:23.753
MATT: Correct.
LAURA: So it's instantly--

01:34:23.753 --> 01:34:25.101
MATT: Yes, you take nothing, that's right.

01:34:25.101 --> 01:34:26.574
LAURA: One, two, three, four, five--

01:34:26.574 --> 01:34:28.082
MATT: Rogues and monks, man.

01:34:28.082 --> 01:34:30.421
LAURA: -- six, seven.
SAM: Wow, is that a reaction

01:34:30.421 --> 01:34:31.254
or does that just happen?

01:34:31.254 --> 01:34:32.087
MATT: No, it just happens.

01:34:32.087 --> 01:34:34.214
MARISHA: It just happens.
MATT: You've got it, too, man.

01:34:34.214 --> 01:34:35.904
SAM: Oh, evasion because it's area attacks.

01:34:35.904 --> 01:34:37.388
MATT: Yeah.
SAM: I'm never near those.

01:34:37.388 --> 01:34:38.221
TRAVIS: She's digging around.
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:34:38.221 --> 01:34:39.054
SAM: Because I run.

01:34:39.054 --> 01:34:39.891
MATT: That's true.

01:34:39.891 --> 01:34:41.656
TRAVIS: It's like the sharpest cake ever.

01:34:41.656 --> 01:34:44.077
MATT: You have active evasion, just not being there.

01:34:45.439 --> 01:34:47.992
LAURA: 45 plus seven.

01:34:47.992 --> 01:34:49.820
MATT: That's 52.
LAURA: 52.

01:34:49.820 --> 01:34:52.004
MATT: Great, so half that would be--

01:34:52.004 --> 01:34:53.972
LAURA: 21
MATT: 26.

01:34:53.972 --> 01:34:56.370
LAURA: 26, that's better.

01:34:56.370 --> 01:34:58.785
MATT: 26 fire damage to Gelidon.

01:34:58.785 --> 01:34:59.654
You got it.
MARISHA: You just take it.

01:34:59.654 --> 01:35:00.487
MATT: All right, end of your turn,

01:35:00.487 --> 01:35:01.578
it's going to use its last two actions

01:35:01.578 --> 01:35:04.078
to do another wing attack.

01:35:04.078 --> 01:35:05.884
Now its wings are beating heavily and that snow and

01:35:05.884 --> 01:35:07.285
wind picks up rapidly.

01:35:07.285 --> 01:35:12.149
Everybody except for Jester and Veth needs to make a--

01:35:13.090 --> 01:35:13.932
TALIESIN: Everybody?

01:35:13.932 --> 01:35:14.960
MATT: Dexterity saving throw.

01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:16.154
SAM: Errybody.

01:35:16.154 --> 01:35:18.234
MATT: Oh, sorry and it goes over there, you're fine.

01:35:18.234 --> 01:35:20.396
LIAM: Are we still all at advantage from the Yasha move

01:35:20.396 --> 01:35:21.896
or was that a one round?

01:35:21.896 --> 01:35:23.467
TRAVIS: One round.
ASHLEY: Yeah, we're done.

01:35:23.467 --> 01:35:24.467
MATT: All right.

01:35:25.808 --> 01:35:28.305
SAM: That's such a cool feature.
TRAVIS: 18.

01:35:28.305 --> 01:35:29.674
MATT: 18, fail.

01:35:29.674 --> 01:35:32.764
You take 16 points of bludgeoning damage and fall prone.

01:35:32.764 --> 01:35:34.665
TRAVIS: Got it.

01:35:34.665 --> 01:35:38.449
MATT: So you, (whoosh, boof) onto the ground.

01:35:39.357 --> 01:35:41.099
Go ahead and make your concentration check for your Fly.

01:35:44.194 --> 01:35:45.327
You do not, you're fine.

01:35:45.327 --> 01:35:47.253
LIAM: I failed, but I will use ring of evasion

01:35:47.253 --> 01:35:48.086
to make it a success.
MATT: You're fine.

01:35:48.086 --> 01:35:49.402
You're way far way, actually.
LIAM: Way far away? Okay.

01:35:49.402 --> 01:35:52.035
MATT: Yeah, sorry, hard to see you when you're off the map.

01:35:53.194 --> 01:35:54.252
LIAM: My favored terrain.

01:35:54.252 --> 01:35:55.174
MATT: Yasha.

01:35:55.174 --> 01:35:56.994
ASHLEY: So I have a thing called Fanatical Focus.

01:35:56.994 --> 01:35:58.634
"If you fail a saving throw while you're raging

01:35:58.634 --> 01:36:00.054
"then you can reroll it"?

01:36:00.054 --> 01:36:00.887
MATT: Yeah, you can do that.

01:36:00.887 --> 01:36:01.784
ASHLEY: But you have to use the new one.

01:36:01.784 --> 01:36:03.634
Because I rolled
SAM: ? A little thing called fanatical ?

01:36:03.634 --> 01:36:04.476
ASHLEY: I rolled a 10 total

01:36:04.476 --> 01:36:05.800
and I think that might be too low.

01:36:05.800 --> 01:36:07.676
MATT: All right, go for it.
ASHLEY: I'm gonna try to do it again.

01:36:07.676 --> 01:36:09.354
TRAVIS: 25 on the concentration check.

01:36:09.354 --> 01:36:10.700
ASHLEY: That's not much better.

01:36:12.700 --> 01:36:14.273
That would be 13.

01:36:14.273 --> 01:36:16.494
MATT: Fail, 16 points of bludgeoning damage to you, halved

01:36:16.494 --> 01:36:18.889
because you're raging, but you are knocked prone.

01:36:20.431 --> 01:36:22.400
ASHLEY: Eight points?
MATT: Yeah, eight points to you total.

01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:23.233
ASHLEY: Okay, that's fine.

01:36:23.233 --> 01:36:24.604
TRAVIS: With War Caster, 25 on the concentration check.

01:36:24.604 --> 01:36:25.695
MATT: So, you maintain the spell,

01:36:25.695 --> 01:36:27.978
but you fall to the ground.

01:36:29.347 --> 01:36:30.180
Beauregard?

01:36:30.180 --> 01:36:31.804
MARISHA: Uh-huh? Oh, 27.

01:36:31.804 --> 01:36:33.112
MATT: 27? You succeed!

01:36:33.112 --> 01:36:34.044
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:36:34.044 --> 01:36:35.682
MATT: Hell yeah, all right.
MARISHA: Hang on.

01:36:35.682 --> 01:36:38.014
MATT: So you hang on. You take half the damage.

01:36:38.014 --> 01:36:40.881
So you would take eight points of bludgeoning damage.

01:36:40.881 --> 01:36:41.714
This is in the air.

01:36:41.714 --> 01:36:43.464
Well, actually this would be-- yeah,

01:36:43.464 --> 01:36:44.297
I guess that would count.

01:36:44.297 --> 01:36:46.684
Yeah, so you take none. Fucking-- All right.

01:36:46.684 --> 01:36:48.164
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:36:48.164 --> 01:36:50.328
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

01:36:50.328 --> 01:36:53.870
Otis fails and gets knocked prone.

01:36:53.870 --> 01:36:56.576
LIAM: Remember when Raishan cast Meteor Storm twice

01:36:56.576 --> 01:36:57.789
and I took no damage?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:36:57.789 --> 01:36:59.555
MATT: Tyffial succeeds.
LAURA: And everyone else was like--

01:36:59.555 --> 01:37:01.446
MARISHA: And we were all fucked up, yeah.

01:37:01.446 --> 01:37:03.587
MATT: Eight. Stays up.

01:37:03.587 --> 01:37:07.275
Lucien succeeds, takes eight.

01:37:09.264 --> 01:37:11.549
SAM: Otis, Otis is down. (coos)

01:37:11.549 --> 01:37:13.694
Smother him in the snow. (coos)

01:37:13.694 --> 01:37:15.102
LIAM: (laughs)

01:37:16.379 --> 01:37:18.299
LAURA: You're right there. You could totally do it yourself.

01:37:18.299 --> 01:37:20.086
SAM: I'm going that way.

01:37:20.086 --> 01:37:24.378
(laughter)

01:37:24.378 --> 01:37:26.044
MATT: Okay.

01:37:26.044 --> 01:37:28.652
SAM: There can be only one halfling.

01:37:28.652 --> 01:37:30.103
I feel the quickening.

01:37:30.103 --> 01:37:32.624
LIAM: Even got a crossbow, come on.

01:37:32.624 --> 01:37:33.457
SAM: I know.

01:37:35.094 --> 01:37:36.451
LIAM: Your shtick.

01:37:36.451 --> 01:37:38.151
SAM: Oh, my shtick.

01:37:38.151 --> 01:37:39.634
MATT: It is now the Gelidon's turn.

01:37:39.634 --> 01:37:42.835
Gelidon is going to attempt to fly upward.

01:37:42.835 --> 01:37:44.471
TRAVIS: Oh, boy.

01:37:44.471 --> 01:37:46.024
LAURA: Stop her.
MARISHA: Pop pop.

01:37:46.024 --> 01:37:47.174
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:37:47.174 --> 01:37:49.184
ASHLEY: Yeah, we get to--
MARISHA: The Sentinel thing.

01:37:49.184 --> 01:37:51.224
I'm on it, but you can. (cooing)

01:37:51.224 --> 01:37:52.299
MATT: You make an attack. You are prone,

01:37:52.299 --> 01:37:53.990
so you have disadvantage on the attack roll.

01:37:53.990 --> 01:37:54.981
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:37:54.981 --> 01:37:57.227
LAURA: But you don't have disadvantage.

01:37:57.227 --> 01:37:58.324
MATT: It's not moving out of her range

01:37:58.324 --> 01:37:59.504
because she's <i>on</i> it.

01:37:59.504 --> 01:38:01.491
TRAVIS: I'll try and do one as well, too.

01:38:01.491 --> 01:38:02.374
SAM: You can Sentinel?

01:38:02.374 --> 01:38:03.848
MATT: No, but he can make a reaction.

01:38:03.848 --> 01:38:05.364
There will be a lot of reaction attacks here.

01:38:05.364 --> 01:38:06.197
TRAVIS: But they're at disadvantage.

01:38:06.197 --> 01:38:08.214
MATT: But I'm going to go for Yasha's first.

01:38:08.214 --> 01:38:10.644
MARISHA: Come on, come on.

01:38:10.644 --> 01:38:11.477
Just straight up.

01:38:11.477 --> 01:38:13.164
Just straight up roll? No, disadvantage, you said.

01:38:13.164 --> 01:38:14.674
SAM: 20 sides to a better you.

01:38:14.674 --> 01:38:15.764
MATT: No, you have disadvantage on it

01:38:15.764 --> 01:38:17.194
because you are on the ground, you are prone.

01:38:17.194 --> 01:38:18.444
ASHLEY: 'Cause I'm laying down.
MATT: Yeah.

01:38:18.444 --> 01:38:20.394
ASHLEY: And I'm swinging.
TRAVIS: (whispering) Go reckless.

01:38:20.394 --> 01:38:24.416
ASHLEY: Fucking fuck! Sorry, I rolled a 20 and a one.

01:38:24.416 --> 01:38:27.275
(groaning)

01:38:27.275 --> 01:38:29.264
MATT: You swing wide on the ground and

01:38:29.264 --> 01:38:30.874
hit the snow next to it.

01:38:30.874 --> 01:38:32.682
ASHLEY: (frustrated noise)

01:38:32.682 --> 01:38:34.123
MARISHA: Shit.
LAURA: And Beau, Yasha.

01:38:35.824 --> 01:38:36.686
MATT: So, yeah.

01:38:36.686 --> 01:38:39.069
ASHLEY: At least I'm rolling semi-decent.

01:38:39.069 --> 01:38:40.510
MATT: You are, your are.

01:38:40.510 --> 01:38:42.462
ASHLEY: For the first time in I don't know how long.

01:38:42.462 --> 01:38:43.311
LIAM: After seven.
TRAVIS: Waking it up.

01:38:43.311 --> 01:38:44.377
MATT: Tyffial misses.

01:38:45.307 --> 01:38:47.573
Lucien hits!

01:38:51.341 --> 01:38:53.274
Double ones on damage dice, but still does

01:38:53.274 --> 01:38:54.282
four points of damage.

01:38:54.282 --> 01:38:55.674
TRAVIS: Reroll ones?

01:38:55.674 --> 01:38:57.198
MATT: No.

01:38:57.198 --> 01:39:01.304
And Zoran hits.

01:39:01.304 --> 01:39:02.898
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's go, Zoran.

01:39:02.898 --> 01:39:03.954
MARISHA: Does he have Sentinel?

01:39:03.954 --> 01:39:06.345
MATT: He does not.
MARISHA: Aww.

01:39:06.345 --> 01:39:08.827
Do you want him to have Sentinel?
TRAVIS: He's got cheese grater.

01:39:08.827 --> 01:39:10.668
MATT: 16 damage,

01:39:10.668 --> 01:39:14.151
and you, Fjord, with disadvantage

01:39:14.151 --> 01:39:15.964
because you are on the ground.

01:39:15.964 --> 01:39:17.036
TRAVIS: No, that's all right.

01:39:17.036 --> 01:39:21.405
Hey, oh, there's a natural 20 but no, 21.

01:39:21.405 --> 01:39:23.213
MATT: 21?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:39:23.213 --> 01:39:25.964
MATT: On the disadvantage?
TRAVIS: Yeah, it was eight plus 13.

01:39:25.964 --> 01:39:27.974
MATT: That still hits. 20 hits, roll damage.

01:39:27.974 --> 01:39:29.637
TRAVIS: Oh, great, oh great.

01:39:30.762 --> 01:39:31.845
ASHLEY: Let's go, Fjord.

01:39:33.503 --> 01:39:34.378
Keep her down.

01:39:34.378 --> 01:39:37.793
TRAVIS: 12 plus five, 17.

01:39:37.793 --> 01:39:42.793
MATT: 17 damage, nice. And she's going to fly into the sky.

01:39:43.088 --> 01:39:44.522
LAURA: Hold on, Beau.
ASHLEY: With Beau?

01:39:44.522 --> 01:39:46.436
MATT: With Beau on her back.

01:39:47.753 --> 01:39:50.794
LAURA: Are you okay that I did this to you? Sorry.

01:39:50.794 --> 01:39:52.619
MARISHA: No, it's great!
LAURA: Okay.

01:39:52.619 --> 01:39:53.485
LIAM: Oopsie.

01:39:54.343 --> 01:39:57.051
SAM: Every time we go on dragons, good things happen.

01:39:57.922 --> 01:40:02.302
MATT: She's going to go ahead and turning this way.

01:40:05.749 --> 01:40:08.334
SAM: Ooh, that looks like some sort of a cone attack.

01:40:08.334 --> 01:40:10.054
LAURA: This looks like it could be bad.

01:40:10.054 --> 01:40:13.777
SAM: Could be like a cone or something.

01:40:13.777 --> 01:40:15.914
TRAVIS: ? Gonna be a cone or something ?

01:40:15.914 --> 01:40:17.180
TALIESIN: How's this dragon?

01:40:17.180 --> 01:40:19.511
This dragon ain't looking rough, are they?
LAURA: No.

01:40:19.511 --> 01:40:21.477
MATT: She's looking hurt-ish.

01:40:21.477 --> 01:40:23.634
Starting to show some wear and tear.

01:40:23.634 --> 01:40:24.517
LIAM: Two thirds.

01:40:24.517 --> 01:40:25.726
LIAM: Two thirds of her hit points.
LAURA: Not even.

01:40:25.726 --> 01:40:27.015
I'd say we're at half.

01:40:27.015 --> 01:40:28.223
MATT: That's what I wanted.

01:40:28.223 --> 01:40:29.706
SAM: Oh, that's a cone.

01:40:29.706 --> 01:40:30.781
LAURA: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:40:30.781 --> 01:40:32.864
SAM: That's a corner of decimation.
LAURA: Am I in that,

01:40:32.864 --> 01:40:33.906
or am I out of it?
MATT: Yes, you are.

01:40:33.906 --> 01:40:36.008
LAURA: Balls.

01:40:36.008 --> 01:40:37.777
What if I took one step backwards?

01:40:41.538 --> 01:40:44.496
MATT: That'll be-- so I need Fjord, Jester

01:40:44.496 --> 01:40:49.071
to go ahead and make a constitution saving throw, please.

01:40:50.424 --> 01:40:52.480
SAM: And who were the other two in that?

01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:54.471
MATT: That's going to be Tyffial and Otis.

01:40:54.471 --> 01:40:57.524
LIAM: Yeah, we're going to get

01:40:57.524 --> 01:40:58.824
home-game Vaxed.

01:41:00.021 --> 01:41:02.073
LAURA: Constitutions saving throw.

01:41:02.073 --> 01:41:03.871
MARISHA: Home game Vaxed?.

01:41:05.079 --> 01:41:06.224
LIAM: Christmas game that I couldn't make.

01:41:06.224 --> 01:41:07.474
So I was just frozen on ice.

01:41:07.474 --> 01:41:10.164
MARISHA: That's right.

01:41:10.164 --> 01:41:12.930
TRAVIS: Constitution saving throw, 19.

01:41:12.930 --> 01:41:14.313
MATT: That's a failure.

01:41:14.313 --> 01:41:16.054
LAURA: 22.
MATT: Failure.

01:41:16.054 --> 01:41:17.694
SAM and LIAM: Ooh.
MARISHA: What?

01:41:17.694 --> 01:41:19.656
LAURA: I rolled a 19.

01:41:19.656 --> 01:41:20.842
MARISHA: Was that for constitution or for--?

01:41:20.842 --> 01:41:22.017
LAURA: Yes.

01:41:22.017 --> 01:41:23.918
MATT: Actually no, 22 just succeeds.

01:41:23.918 --> 01:41:25.484
LAURA: (cackles)

01:41:25.484 --> 01:41:26.317
LIAM: Fjord failed?

01:41:26.317 --> 01:41:28.384
MATT: Fjord fails. Fjord, you take 72 points of cold damage.

01:41:28.384 --> 01:41:29.517
TRAVIS: Seven-two, 72?

01:41:29.517 --> 01:41:30.821
MATT: Yeah, 72 points of cold damage.
SAM: Wait,

01:41:30.821 --> 01:41:32.704
are you immune to cold or something?

01:41:32.704 --> 01:41:35.252
TRAVIS: I am not, I only have a ring of <i>fire resistance</i>!

01:41:35.252 --> 01:41:37.398
(laughter)

01:41:37.398 --> 01:41:38.714
SAM: Goddamn it!

01:41:41.154 --> 01:41:42.154
TRAVIS: That's a big hit.

01:41:42.154 --> 01:41:44.664
LAURA: That's a big hit.

01:41:44.664 --> 01:41:47.217
MATT: Jester, you take half of that.

01:41:47.217 --> 01:41:48.175
MARISHA: How'd the others do?

01:41:48.175 --> 01:41:50.941
MATT: 36 and you are resistant to cold naturally,

01:41:50.941 --> 01:41:53.794
so that brings it down to 18.

01:41:53.794 --> 01:41:55.277
LAURA: Sweet.

01:41:55.277 --> 01:41:56.602
TALIESIN: Wow.
MARISHA: Did Otis get hit?

01:41:56.602 --> 01:41:58.554
MATT: Otis-- both of them actually succeeded on their saves.

01:41:58.554 --> 01:41:59.671
They both took half damage.

01:41:59.671 --> 01:42:01.594
SAM: Okay, okay.

01:42:01.594 --> 01:42:02.931
MARISHA: It's wearing him down.

01:42:02.931 --> 01:42:05.684
TRAVIS: (muffled) That'll change things.
LIAM: [inaudible]

01:42:05.684 --> 01:42:07.482
MATT: Continuing the rest of the flight movement--

01:42:07.482 --> 01:42:10.614
LAURA: Do be resistant to cold.
LIAM: Do be a tiefling resistant to ass.

01:42:10.614 --> 01:42:12.054
Don't be Fjord.
SAM: Are they like frozen

01:42:12.054 --> 01:42:13.521
in blocks of ice or anything or anything?

01:42:13.521 --> 01:42:15.627
MATT: No.
SAM: Okay, just hurts.

01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:19.408
MATT: It's over here.

01:42:19.408 --> 01:42:22.258
LAURA: (laughs)

01:42:24.954 --> 01:42:27.054
MATT: All right, that's Gelidon's turn.

01:42:28.544 --> 01:42:29.464
SAM: That's gnarly.

01:42:29.464 --> 01:42:30.884
MATT: As Gelidon flies back.

01:42:30.884 --> 01:42:32.715
LIAM: That's pretty bad.

01:42:32.715 --> 01:42:36.868
MATT: "Like gnats coming out of everywhere!"

01:42:36.868 --> 01:42:38.264
Unleashes a blast of cold energy,

01:42:38.264 --> 01:42:41.814
and then begins to fly back and is just staying

01:42:41.814 --> 01:42:45.692
in the air about 30 feet, 40 feet above.

01:42:45.692 --> 01:42:49.177
So that brings it to Lucien's go.

01:42:49.177 --> 01:42:51.001
TRAVIS: Sorry, dragon is how high in the air, you said?

01:42:51.001 --> 01:42:52.968
MATT: 35, 40 feet.
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:42:52.968 --> 01:42:56.134
SAM: She's right behind me, isn't she?

01:42:56.134 --> 01:42:59.754
LAURA: Did any of the Tomb Takers, were they

01:42:59.754 --> 01:43:01.154
in the blast zone as well?

01:43:01.154 --> 01:43:01.987
MATT: Two of them were.

01:43:01.987 --> 01:43:04.934
LAURA: Could I see-- did they take the damage?

01:43:04.934 --> 01:43:06.084
Did you already say that?

01:43:06.084 --> 01:43:07.683
MATT: They made the save. They winced,

01:43:07.683 --> 01:43:08.876
but they managed to weather it okay.

01:43:08.876 --> 01:43:10.680
LAURA: Okay.

01:43:10.680 --> 01:43:11.763
MATT: All right.

01:43:13.371 --> 01:43:15.714
Lucien sees this and goes,

01:43:15.714 --> 01:43:17.730
"That's certainly annoying."

01:43:17.730 --> 01:43:19.063
SAM: Oh.

01:43:19.063 --> 01:43:20.602
LAURA: ? Do something cool ?

01:43:20.602 --> 01:43:22.094
SAM: ? Something's happening ?

01:43:22.094 --> 01:43:23.432
MATT: That's there.

01:43:25.909 --> 01:43:27.106
He's going to duck behind there

01:43:27.106 --> 01:43:29.435
and try and stay out of view.

01:43:29.435 --> 01:43:31.043
Tyffial is going to do the same.

01:43:34.254 --> 01:43:37.000
SAM: Ooh, clumping, clumping. Not good.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.594
MATT: Is going to walk up against the side there

01:43:39.594 --> 01:43:41.433
and is trying to-- actually more in this space.

01:43:41.433 --> 01:43:42.466
TRAVIS: My Armor of Hexes.

01:43:42.466 --> 01:43:43.299
LAURA: Did you lose it?

01:43:43.299 --> 01:43:45.990
TRAVIS: I did. I rolled my Armor of Hexes, by the way.

01:43:45.990 --> 01:43:47.440
It was a two, so it hit.

01:43:47.440 --> 01:43:49.187
MATT: Okay, good call.

01:43:49.187 --> 01:43:50.624
Well, it wasn't an attack against you,

01:43:50.624 --> 01:43:52.174
it was a radial effect.

01:43:52.174 --> 01:43:53.915
TRAVIS: Oh great, nevermind.
MATT: So yeah.

01:43:53.915 --> 01:43:56.022
LAURA: Are you holding any kind of concentration spell?

01:43:56.022 --> 01:43:58.475
MATT: That finishes Lucien's turn and Tyffial's turn..

01:43:58.475 --> 01:43:59.308
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:43:59.308 --> 01:44:00.141
MATT: Fjord, you're up.

01:44:00.141 --> 01:44:02.732
TRAVIS: The fly spell, I have to
roll for the Fly spell again.

01:44:05.257 --> 01:44:06.884
That's a 16.

01:44:06.884 --> 01:44:08.000
MATT: To?

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:09.042
TRAVIS: Maintain my Fly spell

01:44:09.042 --> 01:44:10.004
even though I'm prone right now

01:44:10.004 --> 01:44:12.164
because he hit me again with the Cone of Cold.

01:44:12.164 --> 01:44:13.449
MATT: That's right, yeah, 16?

01:44:13.449 --> 01:44:15.294
No, that falls, Fly is gone.

01:44:15.294 --> 01:44:17.485
TRAVIS: Sweet, and I am--

01:44:17.485 --> 01:44:20.785
point to my prone body in the snow? Hi.

01:44:20.785 --> 01:44:22.401
I'll stand up.

01:44:22.401 --> 01:44:23.234
MATT: Okay.

01:44:27.254 --> 01:44:28.827
TRAVIS: Distance to him, ish?

01:44:29.882 --> 01:44:32.670
SAM: Her, her.
MATT: Gauging it to her-- (laughs)

01:44:32.670 --> 01:44:34.321
TALIESIN: It's a dragon, man.
TRAVIS: Sorry.

01:44:34.321 --> 01:44:36.482
MATT: 50, 60-ish feet from where you are at an angle.

01:44:36.482 --> 01:44:40.299
TRAVIS: I'll do three Hex-- Hexblade's Curses. Three--

01:44:40.299 --> 01:44:41.365
MATT: Eldritch Blasts?
TRAVIS: Thank you.

01:44:41.365 --> 01:44:42.814
LAURA: Her face looks like a Skeksis.
MATT: Go ahead and make the rolls.

01:44:42.814 --> 01:44:44.282
LIAM: Yeah.

01:44:44.282 --> 01:44:46.013
SAM: Her face looks like a sex scene?
MARISHA: Yeah, she does have a Skeksis face.

01:44:46.013 --> 01:44:47.467
SAM: What did you say?
LAURA: Skeksis.

01:44:47.467 --> 01:44:50.167
SAM: (laughs) Oh.
ASHLEY: Sexy Skeksis.

01:44:50.167 --> 01:44:51.716
TALIESIN: Sexy Skeksis.
TRAVIS: That's a natural 20.

01:44:51.716 --> 01:44:52.574
MATT: Yeah!

01:44:52.574 --> 01:44:53.407
TRAVIS: For the first one.

01:44:53.407 --> 01:44:54.390
MARISHA: That's going to be my Halloween costume.

01:44:54.390 --> 01:44:56.290
TRAVIS: Second one is--
MARISHA: Sexy sk--

01:44:56.290 --> 01:44:58.505
sexy Skeksis.

01:44:58.505 --> 01:44:59.530
TRAVIS: 17.

01:44:59.530 --> 01:45:01.780
MATT: 17 does not hit.
LIAM: (imitates Skeksis hum)

01:45:01.780 --> 01:45:03.581
Mm!

01:45:03.581 --> 01:45:04.814
TRAVIS: 24.

01:45:04.814 --> 01:45:06.435
MATT: Okay, yeah, so two hits one of which is a crit.

01:45:06.435 --> 01:45:08.250
Go ahead and roll the crit damage first.
LAURA: Nice!

01:45:08.250 --> 01:45:09.083
TALIESIN: Oh!

01:45:10.608 --> 01:45:12.049
SAM: Remember Halloween?

01:45:12.049 --> 01:45:12.882
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:45:12.882 --> 01:45:15.156
TRAVIS: 15, so 30 points of force damage

01:45:15.156 --> 01:45:16.739
on the first one.

01:45:16.739 --> 01:45:17.639
MATT: Okay.

01:45:17.639 --> 01:45:18.684
LIAM: Years ago.

01:45:20.458 --> 01:45:25.214
TRAVIS: Nine plus five, 14 points on the second one

01:45:25.214 --> 01:45:28.404
and the crit gets me an additional damage roll

01:45:28.404 --> 01:45:30.970
with whatever the hell it's called.

01:45:30.970 --> 01:45:33.995
At the bottom of the page. Savage attacks.

01:45:33.995 --> 01:45:34.828
SAM: Savage.

01:45:34.828 --> 01:45:37.000
MATT: It says attacks for savage attack, right?

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:38.554
TRAVIS: "When you score a critical hit, roll one

01:45:38.554 --> 01:45:41.671
"of the dice and additional time."
MATT: Yeah, just making sure it wasn't

01:45:41.671 --> 01:45:42.504
specifying weapon.

01:45:42.504 --> 01:45:44.630
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, it's a nine, so.

01:45:44.630 --> 01:45:46.363
MATT: Great. Another nine damage.

01:45:46.363 --> 01:45:47.564
All right, that finish your turn?
TRAVIS: And I will

01:45:47.564 --> 01:45:50.230
use my movement to--

01:45:52.797 --> 01:45:55.810
I'm going to track with it

01:45:55.810 --> 01:45:57.898
this way, away from the rest of the party.
MATT: Okay, you have 15 feet on that.

01:45:57.898 --> 01:45:59.197
TRAVIS: Oh, 15 right, yeah.

01:45:59.197 --> 01:46:00.297
MATT: You get to there, because you got up from prone.

01:46:00.297 --> 01:46:02.336
You rush off to the side. That finishes your turn?

01:46:02.336 --> 01:46:03.402
TRAVIS: It does.

01:46:03.402 --> 01:46:04.555
MATT: All right,

01:46:07.213 --> 01:46:08.570
Otis is going to get up.

01:46:10.620 --> 01:46:13.804
20, that's the most he can get

01:46:13.804 --> 01:46:15.244
with his prone state.

01:46:15.244 --> 01:46:18.823
He's going to go ahead and bonus action hide behind you.

01:46:18.823 --> 01:46:19.656
TRAVIS: Me?

01:46:19.656 --> 01:46:23.832
MATT: Yeah. Lightfoot halflings can do that.

01:46:23.832 --> 01:46:26.104
And so from your perspective,

01:46:26.104 --> 01:46:28.817
you see Otis run and then vanish.

01:46:29.858 --> 01:46:32.643
Almost like Fjord wiped to another door.

01:46:32.643 --> 01:46:34.629
TRAVIS: Veth, where'd he g-- (chokes)

01:46:34.629 --> 01:46:36.139
(laughter)

01:46:36.139 --> 01:46:39.284
SAM: No! I wanted to kill you.

01:46:39.284 --> 01:46:42.534
(laughter)

01:46:43.530 --> 01:46:46.006
MATT: All righty, that gets us to Zoran's go.

01:46:48.169 --> 01:46:49.810
MARISHA: So good.

01:46:49.810 --> 01:46:54.194
MATT: Four, then make an athletics check to climb up

01:46:54.194 --> 01:46:56.160
the side there offhand.
TRAVIS: Come on, Zoran.

01:46:56.160 --> 01:46:57.376
MATT: Yeah, succeeds.

01:46:58.365 --> 01:47:00.854
Leaps, maul in one hand,

01:47:00.854 --> 01:47:03.013
other arms grabs, uses the momentum

01:47:03.013 --> 01:47:06.484
to lift up and then lands on top.

01:47:06.484 --> 01:47:07.334
LAURA: Wow.

01:47:07.334 --> 01:47:09.017
TRAVIS: Let's go.
LIAM: Whoa.

01:47:09.017 --> 01:47:10.676
LAURA: Do it, Zoran

01:47:10.676 --> 01:47:12.967
LIAM: We've got a Chad. Here it comes.

01:47:12.967 --> 01:47:16.429
MATT: Kind of frustrated at the distance.

01:47:16.429 --> 01:47:17.885
TALIESIN: And the speed.

01:47:20.834 --> 01:47:22.354
MATT: Yeah, he can't--

01:47:22.354 --> 01:47:25.462
He doesn't have the range for him. Okay.

01:47:25.462 --> 01:47:27.605
SAM: Can't you throw something? Come on, man.

01:47:27.605 --> 01:47:28.954
MATT: (laughs)

01:47:28.954 --> 01:47:30.694
That brings us to Caduceus.

01:47:30.694 --> 01:47:31.844
TALIESIN: How far would I have to run to get

01:47:31.844 --> 01:47:33.970
within 60 feet of this?

01:47:35.104 --> 01:47:36.377
MATT: You aren't entirely certain.

01:47:38.934 --> 01:47:41.247
SAM: Depends on the hypotenuse.

01:47:41.247 --> 01:47:44.146
TALIESIN: Wow, okay, I think I'm going to--

01:47:44.146 --> 01:47:45.512
Wow, what am I going to do?

01:47:47.897 --> 01:47:49.605
I'm going to...

01:47:51.271 --> 01:47:54.357
pull to the left,

01:47:54.357 --> 01:47:56.004
away from the group a little bit more.

01:47:56.004 --> 01:47:59.429
Or I suppose my right. I'm so sorry, the map is odd.

01:47:59.429 --> 01:48:00.547
Yeah, towards me.

01:48:01.434 --> 01:48:03.474
Running forward while running also towards

01:48:03.474 --> 01:48:06.007
the edge of the map.
MATT: So about there.

01:48:06.007 --> 01:48:07.314
TALIESIN: Is that about 60?

01:48:07.314 --> 01:48:08.614
MATT: That's 30 feet there.

01:48:08.614 --> 01:48:10.675
You can try whatever you going to do and hope.

01:48:10.675 --> 01:48:12.525
We'll do the math when it goes.

01:48:18.264 --> 01:48:20.404
TALIESIN: Man, this is so risky.

01:48:20.404 --> 01:48:21.509
SAM: Those are the best ones.

01:48:21.509 --> 01:48:25.160
LAURA: Ah! Live it up, Caduceus!

01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:29.005
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and cast Harm.

01:48:29.005 --> 01:48:31.284
MATT: Harm, okay.

01:48:31.284 --> 01:48:33.706
TALIESIN: So it's a--
MATT: Constitution save?

01:48:33.706 --> 01:48:35.064
TALIESIN: Constitution save.

01:48:35.997 --> 01:48:37.346
MATT: 31.

01:48:37.346 --> 01:48:38.362
SAM: Oh!

01:48:38.362 --> 01:48:41.964
TALIESIN: Okay, so that's a save, but still takes--

01:48:41.964 --> 01:48:43.580
MATT: Still takes half.

01:48:43.580 --> 01:48:44.644
TALIESIN: Should I roll just half the dice

01:48:44.644 --> 01:48:47.624
or should I double it and roll the--

01:48:47.624 --> 01:48:49.558
LAURA: Roll it and half the damage.

01:48:49.558 --> 01:48:51.544
MATT: 'Cause you want to roll all the dice.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:48:51.544 --> 01:48:53.384
This is not going to be that great. It's okay.

01:48:53.384 --> 01:48:56.009
LAURA: At my angle, your dice are very sparkly.

01:48:56.009 --> 01:48:57.689
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah.

01:48:57.689 --> 01:49:02.689
(laughter)

01:49:02.794 --> 01:49:04.272
TALIESIN: My angle, too, to be fair.

01:49:04.272 --> 01:49:05.937
SAM: I think he just told you to fuck off.

01:49:05.937 --> 01:49:07.412
(laughter)

01:49:07.412 --> 01:49:09.515
TALIESIN: I'm doing math, man!

01:49:09.515 --> 01:49:12.265
This is 14d6.

01:49:12.265 --> 01:49:14.689
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah.
LAURA: Whoa!

01:49:14.689 --> 01:49:15.731
SAM: Why would they ever do that?!

01:49:15.731 --> 01:49:18.553
Why not just do like 10d8 or--
MARISHA: 3d12?

01:49:18.553 --> 01:49:21.327
SAM and MARISHA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Why do you never roll luck?

01:49:21.327 --> 01:49:23.244
Thank you.

01:49:23.244 --> 01:49:24.356
TRAVIS: I love it.
SAM: Shamed me.

01:49:24.356 --> 01:49:25.674
MATT: (laughs)

01:49:25.674 --> 01:49:27.500
TRAVIS: Is your mustache okay?

01:49:27.500 --> 01:49:28.424
SAM: Did it fall off?

01:49:28.424 --> 01:49:30.733
(laughter)

01:49:30.733 --> 01:49:31.852
MATT: I think you're good.

01:49:31.852 --> 01:49:33.786
MARISHA: Unfortunately--

01:49:35.319 --> 01:49:36.152
ASHLEY: It is moving.

01:49:36.152 --> 01:49:37.847
LAURA: Did you color your mustache?

01:49:37.847 --> 01:49:39.738
SAM: What?
LAURA: Did you color your mustache?

01:49:39.738 --> 01:49:41.914
SAM: No, that's just the color of my--

01:49:41.914 --> 01:49:43.534
LAURA: Why is your mustache so dark

01:49:43.534 --> 01:49:45.826
and then your beard was so not?

01:49:45.826 --> 01:49:47.631
SAM: I don't know!

01:49:47.631 --> 01:49:48.654
TRAVIS: It's real strange.

01:49:48.654 --> 01:49:51.037
SAM: I don't know! I have these weird

01:49:51.037 --> 01:49:52.184
patches of different--
TALIESIN: 48.

01:49:52.184 --> 01:49:55.411
MATT: 48.
TALIESIN: 48 points of

01:49:55.411 --> 01:49:56.544
necrotic damage.

01:49:56.544 --> 01:49:58.944
And that also lowers max health.

01:49:58.944 --> 01:50:00.164
MATT: Gotcha.
MARISHA: Oh!

01:50:00.164 --> 01:50:02.613
MATT: So half of 48 would be 24, so it's 24.

01:50:02.613 --> 01:50:03.471
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: Yeah.

01:50:03.471 --> 01:50:05.802
MARISHA: What level spell is that?

01:50:05.802 --> 01:50:07.586
TALIESIN: That's a sixth.

01:50:07.586 --> 01:50:09.064
MATT: Yeah, that's Harm.

01:50:09.064 --> 01:50:10.884
ASHLEY: How much does it lower the--?

01:50:10.884 --> 01:50:12.542
TALIESIN: However much damage you do--

01:50:12.542 --> 01:50:13.668
MATT: It lowers the maximum.
TALIESIN: It lowers.

01:50:13.668 --> 01:50:15.535
LAURA: Caduceus just did a Harm spell?

01:50:15.535 --> 01:50:16.763
MATT and TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:50:16.763 --> 01:50:18.688
LIAM: Desperate times, you know?

01:50:18.688 --> 01:50:20.204
MATT: All right, that finish your go?

01:50:20.204 --> 01:50:21.037
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:50:21.037 --> 01:50:22.062
MATT: At the end of Caduceus' turn, it's going to use a

01:50:22.062 --> 01:50:24.507
legendary action to tail strike you, Beauregard.

01:50:24.507 --> 01:50:25.474
Because you're the one there.

01:50:25.474 --> 01:50:27.074
So now it's trying to swat the gnat

01:50:27.074 --> 01:50:28.334
on its shoulders from behind.

01:50:28.334 --> 01:50:30.574
MARISHA: Sure. Patient Defense is up.

01:50:30.574 --> 01:50:32.798
MATT: So disadvantage on the attack.
MARISHA: At disadvantage,

01:50:32.798 --> 01:50:34.914
LAURA: Is it trying to do this to something?

01:50:34.914 --> 01:50:36.105
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:50:36.105 --> 01:50:37.884
LAURA: I imagine it looks really stupid.

01:50:37.884 --> 01:50:38.717
MARISHA: Really dumb.
SAM: Uh-huh.

01:50:38.717 --> 01:50:39.864
MATT: 21.

01:50:39.864 --> 01:50:41.742
MARISHA: 21 is my AC.

01:50:41.742 --> 01:50:44.171
MATT: It literally rolled two sevens plus 14.

01:50:44.171 --> 01:50:45.674
Oh sorry, plus-- yeah, plus 14.

01:50:45.674 --> 01:50:46.624
LIAM: Oh good, plus 14.

01:50:46.624 --> 01:50:49.832
MATT: So you take, for the tail strike--

01:50:57.537 --> 01:51:01.244
take 15 points of bludgeoning damage, as the tail

01:51:01.244 --> 01:51:03.205
cracks you across the back of the shoulders and the neck.

01:51:03.205 --> 01:51:05.577
You hear a slight snap of something,

01:51:05.577 --> 01:51:08.654
a tendon or muscle and you're just like (grunts).

01:51:08.654 --> 01:51:11.707
Holding on best you can, as winds just whipping around you.

01:51:11.707 --> 01:51:14.547
The cold is now causing your face and arms to go numb,

01:51:14.547 --> 01:51:16.897
your abs exposed, usually very good against the weather,

01:51:16.897 --> 01:51:18.017
right now are starting to fail.

01:51:18.017 --> 01:51:19.787
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.
LAURA: (giggles)

01:51:19.787 --> 01:51:22.065
MATT: Okay, that finishes--
TRAVIS: "Usually very good."

01:51:22.065 --> 01:51:25.481
(laughter)

01:51:25.481 --> 01:51:26.556
MARISHA: Yasha.
MATT: It's true.

01:51:26.556 --> 01:51:27.877
MARISHA: Hey, Yasha.
ASHLEY: Yeah?

01:51:27.877 --> 01:51:30.544
MARISHA: Look, I'm riding the dragon. Do you see me?

01:51:30.544 --> 01:51:31.975
Do you see me, Yasha?
ASHLEY: You look so good.

01:51:31.975 --> 01:51:33.802
MARISHA: Thanks, dude!

01:51:33.802 --> 01:51:35.756
SAM: You're quaking and crying with fear.

01:51:35.756 --> 01:51:37.796
MARISHA: (whimpering) Do I look cool, though?

01:51:37.796 --> 01:51:39.683
ASHLEY: You look so cool. You look so hot.

01:51:39.683 --> 01:51:40.766
MARISHA: (crying) Okay.

01:51:40.766 --> 01:51:41.797
LIAM: That was the inner monologue.

01:51:41.797 --> 01:51:44.311
We just heard (unintelligible screams).
MATT: Cree darts up next to you

01:51:44.311 --> 01:51:46.087
and goes,

01:51:46.087 --> 01:51:49.107
"I like your idea, full of surprises."

01:51:49.107 --> 01:51:51.807
Puts her hand up and clutches the red orb with the other

01:51:51.807 --> 01:51:54.008
hand and you watch as she casts Harm as well.

01:51:54.008 --> 01:51:55.817
LAURA: I think Cree likes you.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:51:55.817 --> 01:51:57.108
TALIESIN: I think Cree is trying to get us both killed.

01:51:57.108 --> 01:51:59.977
MATT: Succeeds on the save because of all its constitution.

01:51:59.977 --> 01:52:02.210
LAURA: She just keeps running up
next to you wherever you go.

01:52:02.210 --> 01:52:03.510
Like, leave-- stop it.

01:52:03.510 --> 01:52:05.754
TALIESIN: I'm a one-wolf wolf pack, come on.

01:52:05.754 --> 01:52:07.786
(laughter)

01:52:07.786 --> 01:52:09.046
TRAVIS: One wolf pack.
MARISHA: "I'm a one-wolf wolf pack."

01:52:09.046 --> 01:52:13.787
TALIESIN: There you go. That's not
my joke, but I'm proud of it.

01:52:13.787 --> 01:52:15.337
Can't take credit for that one.

01:52:16.715 --> 01:52:19.627
(scattered laughter)

01:52:19.627 --> 01:52:20.702
SAM: What happened to our battle music?

01:52:20.702 --> 01:52:23.132
MATT: Good roll-- oh, it did, it crashed, sorry.

01:52:23.132 --> 01:52:25.097
SAM: It crashed?
LAURA: I didn't even notice.

01:52:25.097 --> 01:52:26.482
MATT: Trying to do math! Shhh.
LIAM: ? (battle horn sound) ?

01:52:26.482 --> 01:52:28.103
SAM: ? (singing battle music) ?

01:52:28.103 --> 01:52:30.894
MATT: I'm doing math. Shut the fuck--
LAURA: He's moving-- he's mathing.

01:52:30.894 --> 01:52:32.026
ASHLEY: ? (battle horn sound) ?

01:52:32.026 --> 01:52:33.805
(laughter)

01:52:33.805 --> 01:52:35.064
TALIESIN: Not easy, is it?

01:52:36.487 --> 01:52:38.037
MATT: What, do you guys want me to just waive the damage?

01:52:38.037 --> 01:52:39.819
ALL: No, no, no, no, no, no!

01:52:39.819 --> 01:52:41.398
(laughter)

01:52:41.398 --> 01:52:44.052
TALIESIN: 14d6 is a lot.

01:52:44.052 --> 01:52:45.417
MARISHA: 14d6 <i>is</i> a lot.

01:52:45.417 --> 01:52:46.897
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: 56 points of damage

01:52:46.897 --> 01:52:51.897
to half would be 28.

01:52:52.107 --> 01:52:54.947
LIAM: This was a random roll on an encounter table.

01:52:54.947 --> 01:52:55.999
MATT: Yep! Yep.

01:52:55.999 --> 01:52:58.557
TRAVIS: Yep.
SAM: Ashley Johnson.

01:52:58.557 --> 01:53:01.317
MATT: All right, so with that, you can see now

01:53:01.317 --> 01:53:02.983
Gelidon's starting to look hurt.

01:53:02.983 --> 01:53:03.816
LAURA: Oh.
SAM: Okay.

01:53:03.816 --> 01:53:05.447
MATT: Like starting to show some wear and tear.

01:53:05.447 --> 01:53:06.969
LIAM: Oh yeah?
MATT: This dragon was not

01:53:06.969 --> 01:53:09.977
expecting to suddenly have an entire group

01:53:09.977 --> 01:53:12.857
of what is essentially 12 people leap from the snow

01:53:12.857 --> 01:53:14.310
and know what they're doing.

01:53:16.107 --> 01:53:17.757
SAM: She's going to bug out.
LIAM: Yeah.

01:53:17.757 --> 01:53:19.205
MARISHA: Sounds like it.

01:53:19.205 --> 01:53:21.207
MATT: That brings us to Caleb's turn.

01:53:21.207 --> 01:53:24.527
LIAM: Okay, I will move-- use all
of my movement to get closer

01:53:24.527 --> 01:53:27.567
to the dragon and I have very few spells that can reach

01:53:27.567 --> 01:53:30.437
that far and Fireball is bad for Beauregard's cuticles,

01:53:30.437 --> 01:53:33.544
so I will just try Slow again.

01:53:33.544 --> 01:53:35.697
It's 18 it has to beat for wisdom.

01:53:35.697 --> 01:53:36.530
MATT: For wisdom.

01:53:37.647 --> 01:53:39.797
That is a 20.

01:53:39.797 --> 01:53:40.757
LIAM: Oh, come on, man.

01:53:40.757 --> 01:53:42.088
MATT: I'm sorry!

01:53:42.088 --> 01:53:43.047
(laughter)

01:53:43.047 --> 01:53:46.005
Ancient dragons have a lot of saving throw bonuses.

01:53:46.005 --> 01:53:47.649
LIAM: I'm having a blast.
MATT: You guys are doing

01:53:47.649 --> 01:53:50.297
great on this with damage.

01:53:50.297 --> 01:53:51.788
All right.

01:53:51.788 --> 01:53:53.127
So that finishes your go, Caleb.

01:53:53.127 --> 01:53:55.177
Top is Veth. Yasha, you're on deck.

01:53:55.177 --> 01:53:57.007
SAM: Not much I can do.
MATT: Actually, at the end

01:53:57.007 --> 01:53:58.387
of Caleb's turn, it's going to go ahead and do another

01:53:58.387 --> 01:53:59.342
tail swipe against you, Beauregard.

01:53:59.342 --> 01:54:01.320
SAM: Sure, sure.
MARISHA: Patient Defense is still up.

01:54:02.867 --> 01:54:04.297
MATT: That is going to be...

01:54:06.687 --> 01:54:08.277
19, that misses.

01:54:08.277 --> 01:54:10.877
So the tail actually sweeps over and you,

01:54:10.877 --> 01:54:12.827
feeling it coming, you dodge out of the way

01:54:12.827 --> 01:54:14.517
and kick your foot up and actually

01:54:14.517 --> 01:54:17.007
parries it off to the side, your foot's a little sore

01:54:17.007 --> 01:54:18.637
and numb from the impact.

01:54:18.637 --> 01:54:20.327
Like you just hit your funny bone in your whole leg,

01:54:20.327 --> 01:54:22.977
but nevertheless, you've managed to kick the tail off

01:54:22.977 --> 01:54:24.367
from smashing you against its back.

01:54:24.367 --> 01:54:25.200
TRAVIS: It could just hit himself in the head.

01:54:25.200 --> 01:54:26.679
MARISHA: High five, bitch.
TRAVIS: Herself.

01:54:26.679 --> 01:54:27.779
(laughter)

01:54:27.779 --> 01:54:29.637
MATT: All right, now, Veth, what are you doing?

01:54:29.637 --> 01:54:32.097
SAM: I will run away and as I'm running away,

01:54:32.097 --> 01:54:34.789
I'll just fire behind me blind.

01:54:34.789 --> 01:54:36.587
MATT: (laughs) Go for it.

01:54:36.587 --> 01:54:37.840
SAM: See if I can hit.

01:54:38.967 --> 01:54:40.075
Natural 20.

01:54:40.075 --> 01:54:41.575
MARISHA: Oh ho ho!
MATT: Yeah!

01:54:42.534 --> 01:54:43.384
Yeah!

01:54:43.384 --> 01:54:44.627
(clapping)

01:54:44.627 --> 01:54:47.338
ASHLEY: Yes!
? (triumphant battle horn noises) ?

01:54:47.338 --> 01:54:49.372
(laughter)

01:54:49.372 --> 01:54:51.067
SAM: Whoa.

01:54:51.067 --> 01:54:54.038
MARISHA: Do you walk away slowly as you do it?

01:54:54.038 --> 01:54:55.788
A little slow mo?

01:54:57.139 --> 01:54:58.464
SAM: It's a good roll.

01:54:59.937 --> 01:55:02.099
36 doubled.

01:55:02.099 --> 01:55:03.290
LAURA: Whoa!
MATT: On the dice?

01:55:03.290 --> 01:55:05.157
SAM: No, 36-- yeah.

01:55:05.157 --> 01:55:06.987
MATT: Yeah, without the modifier bonus, so yeah,

01:55:06.987 --> 01:55:08.727
if it's just the dice, and that's 36,

01:55:08.727 --> 01:55:09.687
then double it, yeah.

01:55:09.687 --> 01:55:12.333
SAM: Okay, so that's 72 plus--

01:55:12.333 --> 01:55:13.374
LIAM: Plus the stuff.

01:55:13.374 --> 01:55:14.524
SAM: Wait, I'm sorry.

01:55:15.967 --> 01:55:18.377
It was slightly less than that.

01:55:18.377 --> 01:55:20.564
MATT: Okay.
SAM: Because one of these is--

01:55:20.564 --> 01:55:22.827
oh, wait, no, no, no, I haven't done the modifier yet.

01:55:22.827 --> 01:55:25.764
So then that's plus six, so it's 72 plus six is 78.

01:55:25.764 --> 01:55:26.597
MATT: 78.
LAURA: Wow.

01:55:26.597 --> 01:55:27.822
MARISHA: Whoa.
MATT: That's a rogue hit.

01:55:27.822 --> 01:55:28.837
TRAVIS: Damn.
TALIESIN: Oh.

01:55:28.837 --> 01:55:30.307
MATT: That's a rogue hit!

01:55:30.307 --> 01:55:31.477
Well done.
SAM: And it's a natural 20.

01:55:31.477 --> 01:55:32.447
So it shoots again.

01:55:32.447 --> 01:55:33.280
MATT: Yep.
LAURA: Whoa!

01:55:34.567 --> 01:55:35.617
SAM: 28 to hit.

01:55:35.617 --> 01:55:36.450
MATT: Yeah, it does damage--
MARISHA: Oh shit!

01:55:36.450 --> 01:55:38.627
MATT: -- so roll another d6 plus--

01:55:38.627 --> 01:55:41.557
SAM: Just a one plus six is seven more.

01:55:41.557 --> 01:55:44.237
MATT: All right, nice, seven more damage.

01:55:44.237 --> 01:55:46.477
That finishes your turn? Or you moved.

01:55:46.477 --> 01:55:49.569
SAM: Running away, I'm going to try to hide behind Fjord.

01:55:49.569 --> 01:55:51.902
(laughter)

01:55:51.902 --> 01:55:53.377
TRAVIS: Where are you-- (impact sounds, groan)

01:55:53.377 --> 01:55:54.927
MATT: You're a lightfoot halfling?

01:55:54.927 --> 01:55:56.387
SAM: Huh?
MATT: Are you a lightfoot halfling?

01:55:56.387 --> 01:55:57.377
SAM: Yes, I am.

01:55:57.377 --> 01:55:59.807
MATT: Okay, so you rush behind Fjord and you see Otis

01:55:59.807 --> 01:56:01.655
right there is like, (whispers) "Already taken."

01:56:01.655 --> 01:56:03.225
(laughter)
"Already taken."

01:56:03.225 --> 01:56:04.932
SAM: He's my friend! You go, you go!

01:56:04.932 --> 01:56:06.957
MATT: "No, it's (grumbles)."
(laughter)

01:56:06.957 --> 01:56:08.397
MATT: Roll a stealth check to see if you guys

01:56:08.397 --> 01:56:10.337
can Tetris-stack behind Fjord.

01:56:10.337 --> 01:56:12.691
LIAM: Fjord is a halfling clown car.

01:56:12.691 --> 01:56:13.649
(laughter)

01:56:13.649 --> 01:56:15.165
SAM: Is it-- what, stealth?

01:56:15.165 --> 01:56:16.534
Dexterity?
MATT: Yeah, to hide, yeah.

01:56:16.534 --> 01:56:17.727
SAM: So with advantage?

01:56:17.727 --> 01:56:20.052
MATT: Yeah. Because of your cloak.

01:56:20.052 --> 01:56:21.767
SAM: Okay, we're having a stealth off.

01:56:21.767 --> 01:56:23.677
MATT: Yep.
SAM: 29.

01:56:23.677 --> 01:56:26.489
MATT: You both manage to stack weirdly.

01:56:26.489 --> 01:56:28.376
(laughter)

01:56:28.376 --> 01:56:30.279
It's like I said, it's like the Japanese game show

01:56:30.279 --> 01:56:31.766
where they're having to cluster up

01:56:31.766 --> 01:56:33.317
to fit through the holes of Tetris.

01:56:33.317 --> 01:56:36.396
You're both forming behind Fjord, like a tree.

01:56:36.396 --> 01:56:38.004
SAM: Get your hands off my tits!

01:56:38.004 --> 01:56:40.517
(laughter)

01:56:40.517 --> 01:56:44.004
MATT: Okay, that finishes your go.

01:56:44.004 --> 01:56:45.005
At the end of your turn, it's going to use its last

01:56:45.005 --> 01:56:46.997
legendary action to try and hit you one more time.

01:56:46.997 --> 01:56:49.167
MARISHA: Okay, disadvantage still.
MATT: Mm-hmm.

01:56:52.047 --> 01:56:52.880
MATT: Natural one.

01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:55.257
MARISHA: Oh, oh, oh!
MATT: That stance is saving you.

01:56:55.257 --> 01:56:56.957
Don't forget, don't forget.

01:56:56.957 --> 01:56:58.017
MARISHA: What?
MATT: When something you've

01:56:58.017 --> 01:56:59.565
analyzed misses you with an attack--

01:56:59.565 --> 01:57:01.296
MARISHA: Oh, I can do my reaction!
MATT: You can-- you can.

01:57:01.296 --> 01:57:02.154
MARISHA: I'm going to do that!

01:57:02.154 --> 01:57:02.987
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: Right now.

01:57:02.987 --> 01:57:04.247
MATT: So technically, if you want
to spend two more ki points,

01:57:04.247 --> 01:57:06.617
you could've hit it twice in the interim.

01:57:06.617 --> 01:57:07.987
Don't forget, that's one of the main features.
MARISHA: I'm so distracted

01:57:07.987 --> 01:57:09.179
because it's a dragon.

01:57:09.179 --> 01:57:10.012
MATT: I know.

01:57:10.012 --> 01:57:11.003
MARISHA: Well, I'm going to hit it.

01:57:12.387 --> 01:57:13.477
Natural 20.

01:57:13.477 --> 01:57:14.675
TRAVIS: Yeah!
MATT: Hell, yeah.

01:57:14.675 --> 01:57:16.497
TALIESIN: What is happening?
MATT: Hell, yeah.

01:57:16.497 --> 01:57:18.287
ASHLEY: Bring her down.
MARISHA: Okay.

01:57:18.287 --> 01:57:19.402
Come on, come on.

01:57:19.402 --> 01:57:20.235
Big money.

01:57:20.235 --> 01:57:21.573
LAURA: This has to be the record for the most

01:57:21.573 --> 01:57:22.850
nat 20s in the game.
MARISHA: That's-- okay.

01:57:23.907 --> 01:57:25.467
SAM: Yeah.
MARISHA: What's 16 plus seven?

01:57:25.467 --> 01:57:27.637
Is 21.
MATT: 23.

01:57:27.637 --> 01:57:29.281
MARISHA: 23.

01:57:29.281 --> 01:57:30.837
TRAVIS: CRStats is on it.

01:57:30.837 --> 01:57:33.119
Can I spend a ki point to do another one for that last one?

01:57:33.119 --> 01:57:34.219
MATT: Yeah, you can, because you can spend--

01:57:34.219 --> 01:57:35.857
you can take additional reactions.

01:57:37.057 --> 01:57:38.557
The tail missed as you kicked it off.

01:57:38.557 --> 01:57:40.907
You actually kick it at one of its joints

01:57:40.907 --> 01:57:42.877
and you hear a bone crack.

01:57:42.877 --> 01:57:44.397
As the tail pulls back, there's a kink in it.

01:57:44.397 --> 01:57:45.707
You actually managed to damage the tail

01:57:45.707 --> 01:57:47.327
by kicking it off you last round.

01:57:47.327 --> 01:57:49.995
This round, you spend a ki point to do another reaction.

01:57:49.995 --> 01:57:52.407
It misses.
MARISHA: As a reaction, I see it coming,

01:57:52.407 --> 01:57:55.737
I'm going to try and brace my staff

01:57:55.737 --> 01:57:58.342
in a way that it'll crack over top of the staff.

01:57:58.342 --> 01:57:59.477
MATT: Go for it.

01:57:59.477 --> 01:58:01.647
MARISHA: Maybe, maybe? No, no,

01:58:01.647 --> 01:58:04.177
that's not as good as the last time, 16?

01:58:04.177 --> 01:58:05.320
MATT: 16 misses.

01:58:05.320 --> 01:58:06.764
MARISHA: 18, it would technically be 18,

01:58:06.764 --> 01:58:07.688
but sill misses.
MATT: 18 still misses.

01:58:07.688 --> 01:58:09.217
But, no, but good call, good call.

01:58:09.217 --> 01:58:10.317
MARISHA: Okay.
MATT: Yeah, don't forget,

01:58:10.317 --> 01:58:11.530
when you have something analyzed like that

01:58:11.530 --> 01:58:13.607
with Extract Aspects, you can do that when they miss you.

01:58:13.607 --> 01:58:15.917
All right, cool, then it's now Yasha's go.

01:58:15.917 --> 01:58:18.147
ASHLEY: Okay, so

01:58:18.147 --> 01:58:20.847
I'm prone.

01:58:20.847 --> 01:58:21.680
MATT: You are prone.

01:58:21.680 --> 01:58:23.747
ASHLEY: Okay, so I will get up.

01:58:23.747 --> 01:58:25.247
MATT: Okay, that's half your move.

01:58:27.267 --> 01:58:28.100
ASHLEY: How far?

01:58:28.987 --> 01:58:31.857
Would you guys mind moving the camera around so I can see?

01:58:31.857 --> 01:58:33.465
There we go.
TALIESIN: Hey.

01:58:33.465 --> 01:58:35.337
TRAVIS: Nice.

01:58:35.337 --> 01:58:36.850
ASHLEY: Oh, I can't get all the way over there, then.

01:58:36.850 --> 01:58:38.087
I mean, I can't even...

01:58:39.297 --> 01:58:40.130
Here's a question.

01:58:40.130 --> 01:58:40.963
MATT: Yes?

01:58:42.027 --> 01:58:43.527
ASHLEY: So if you use your movement

01:58:44.367 --> 01:58:47.127
and then if I were to, say, also

01:58:47.967 --> 01:58:52.827
fly, do you also get that extra movement once you--

01:58:52.827 --> 01:58:54.217
MATT: You would have to do that first.

01:58:54.217 --> 01:58:56.677
ASHLEY: That would be first, okay, okay, okay.

01:58:56.677 --> 01:58:58.167
Well, I can't reach him anyway, so this

01:58:58.167 --> 01:59:00.192
is a fun thing to happen-- her.

01:59:02.517 --> 01:59:05.177
SAM: Matt, can we just change it to a boy?

01:59:05.177 --> 01:59:06.877
MATT: No!
SAM: Because, really.

01:59:06.877 --> 01:59:07.920
MATT: No!
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:59:07.920 --> 01:59:09.758
TRAVIS: Sorry, sorry.
ASHLEY: I'm going to--

01:59:09.758 --> 01:59:12.000
MATT: She is the Nightmare in Ivory and you respect that.

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:12.833
ASHLEY: Yeah.
SAM: You're right, you're right.

01:59:12.833 --> 01:59:13.774
TRAVIS: The Nightmare in Ivory.

01:59:13.774 --> 01:59:15.467
MATT: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to run over

01:59:15.467 --> 01:59:18.287
as far as I can to get closer.

01:59:18.287 --> 01:59:19.134
MATT: Okay.
ASHLEY: Because--

01:59:19.134 --> 01:59:21.315
MATT: So you move-- So your movement normally is?

01:59:22.602 --> 01:59:24.343
ASHLEY: 50.
MATT: So you have five, 10,

01:59:24.343 --> 01:59:25.293
15, 20,

01:59:25.293 --> 01:59:27.105
25, that's as close as you can get on your move.

01:59:27.105 --> 01:59:29.596
You still have your action and your bonus, if you wanted.

01:59:33.397 --> 01:59:36.100
ASHLEY: I mean, I can't really do anything.

01:59:45.560 --> 01:59:47.271
(frustrated grunt)
LAURA: Lose your rage if you don't attack?

01:59:47.271 --> 01:59:48.496
TRAVIS: That's okay, she's got other rages.

01:59:48.496 --> 01:59:49.357
ASHLEY: I have other rages.
LAURA: Oh, okay.

01:59:49.357 --> 01:59:50.397
TRAVIS: Just make sure you don't go down.

01:59:50.397 --> 01:59:51.857
TALIESIN: Keep the rage up if you need to.

01:59:51.857 --> 01:59:53.407
ASHLEY: Yeah, um...

01:59:56.077 --> 01:59:56.910
(frustrated grunt)

01:59:56.910 --> 01:59:58.754
SAM: Use your spells.
ASHLEY: I'm just like standing out in the middle.

01:59:58.754 --> 02:00:00.512
ASHLEY: All my spells that I have?
SAM: Yeah, use your spells.

02:00:00.512 --> 02:00:02.667
(laughter)

02:00:02.667 --> 02:00:06.350
LAURA: Just throw something. That's
always worked for you before.

02:00:06.350 --> 02:00:09.533
SAM: You got two swords.
ASHLEY: I mean.

02:00:09.533 --> 02:00:11.147
I'll throw a fucking sword again.

02:00:11.147 --> 02:00:12.707
I can't, I mean--

02:00:12.707 --> 02:00:14.467
MARISHA: Also with me on the monster

02:00:14.467 --> 02:00:15.467
that you're throwing it towards.

02:00:15.467 --> 02:00:16.631
MATT: You know what?
ASHLEY: You know what, I'm--

02:00:16.631 --> 02:00:18.130
MATT: What are you going to do?
ASHLEY: You know what I'm going to do?

02:00:18.130 --> 02:00:19.309
I am going to--

02:00:19.309 --> 02:00:20.192
LIAM: (New York accent) What are you going to do?

02:00:20.192 --> 02:00:21.025
MATT: (laughs)

02:00:21.025 --> 02:00:23.100
SAM: (pigeon coo) Kill Otis.

02:00:25.317 --> 02:00:27.427
ASHLEY: I'm going to use Radiant Soul.

02:00:27.427 --> 02:00:29.427
So I'm going to bamf out my wings.

02:00:29.427 --> 02:00:32.382
(gasping)

02:00:32.382 --> 02:00:33.665
ASHLEY: And, uh...

02:00:36.363 --> 02:00:37.196
(sighs)

02:00:38.907 --> 02:00:41.240
(stammers, frustrated sigh)

02:00:41.240 --> 02:00:42.172
I want to hit it!

02:00:42.172 --> 02:00:43.682
(laughter)

02:00:43.682 --> 02:00:45.317
ASHLEY: But if I do that, I can't
throw the sword, obviously.

02:00:45.317 --> 02:00:46.454
MATT: Correct, it's an action to do that.

02:00:46.454 --> 02:00:47.540
TRAVIS: That's okay.
LAURA: That's okay.

02:00:47.540 --> 02:00:48.818
TRAVIS: It'll look real cool.
LAURA: This'll be cool.

02:00:48.818 --> 02:00:50.037
ASHLEY: I'm going to throw the sword.

02:00:50.037 --> 02:00:50.937
I don't want to use this.

02:00:50.937 --> 02:00:52.301
I don't want to use this yet.
TRAVIS: Are you sure? Are you sure?

02:00:52.301 --> 02:00:53.626
ASHLEY: I'm sure. I'm going to throw the sword.

02:00:53.626 --> 02:00:55.237
I'm going to throw the Skingorger.

02:00:55.237 --> 02:00:57.427
MATT: Okay, so you just--
ASHLEY: Just chuck it.

02:00:57.427 --> 02:00:59.587
MATT: Roll an attack with disadvantage.

02:00:59.587 --> 02:01:00.607
ASHLEY: Did I say it weird?
MATT: Yeah.

02:01:00.607 --> 02:01:01.787
ASHLEY: Roll with a disadvantage.
MATT: Disadvantage.

02:01:01.787 --> 02:01:02.620
ASHLEY: Of course.
MATT: You can reckless

02:01:02.620 --> 02:01:04.490
if you want to cancel it, but it's up to you.

02:01:04.490 --> 02:01:05.610
ASHLEY: This was cocked.

02:01:07.317 --> 02:01:09.217
Cocked again, I'm not going to roll that.

02:01:10.547 --> 02:01:11.380
Oh.

02:01:13.909 --> 02:01:17.354
That is amazing, because that's two ones.

02:01:17.354 --> 02:01:18.429
(laughter)

02:01:18.429 --> 02:01:19.679
TRAVIS: Oh my god.
MATT: Are you serious?

02:01:19.679 --> 02:01:20.960
ASHLEY: I'm dead serious.

02:01:21.877 --> 02:01:23.637
TALIESIN: Wow, it's going tonight.

02:01:23.637 --> 02:01:24.720
MATT: Beauregard.

02:01:24.720 --> 02:01:26.079
LAURA: Oh no!

02:01:26.079 --> 02:01:28.111
MARISHA: Oh.
ASHLEY: No! <i>No.</i>

02:01:28.111 --> 02:01:29.411
MATT: No, I'm not going to do that.

02:01:29.411 --> 02:01:31.224
I'm not going to do that, I'm kidding.

02:01:31.224 --> 02:01:32.195
(laughter)

02:01:32.195 --> 02:01:35.632
LIAM: Two ones?
MARISHA: I still have Patient Defense.

02:01:35.632 --> 02:01:39.157
MATT: No, you do, you do. It's double ones on that?

02:01:39.157 --> 02:01:40.482
I can't not do something with that;

02:01:40.482 --> 02:01:42.491
it's double ones on this.
TRAVIS: Yeah, you have to.

02:01:42.491 --> 02:01:44.206
LIAM: Got to.
ASHLEY: You have to?

02:01:44.206 --> 02:01:46.937
TRAVIS: On double ones.
ASHLEY: You do have to.

02:01:46.937 --> 02:01:50.087
MATT: Just roll two attack rolls again with disadvantage.

02:01:50.087 --> 02:01:54.697
TRAVIS: The perfect yin and yang
to your previous double 20s.

02:01:54.697 --> 02:01:56.157
ASHLEY: Where were you?!

02:01:56.157 --> 02:01:56.990
18.

02:01:58.111 --> 02:01:59.607
And a five.

02:01:59.607 --> 02:02:01.732
SAM: Plus something.
MATT: Plus.

02:02:01.732 --> 02:02:02.967
ASHLEY: What am I adding, I'm sorry?

02:02:02.967 --> 02:02:05.965
MATT: Adding your attack bonus.
ASHLEY: Oh, attack bonus, oh.

02:02:05.965 --> 02:02:07.087
For the disadvantage one?

02:02:07.087 --> 02:02:08.646
MATT: Yeah.

02:02:08.646 --> 02:02:10.054
ASHLEY: 13.
MATT: 13, yeah.

02:02:10.054 --> 02:02:13.967
So thankfully, Skingorger goes wide and Beauregard,

02:02:13.967 --> 02:02:17.257
you see it kind of-- you just

02:02:17.257 --> 02:02:19.757
parry out of the way as it arcs off

02:02:19.757 --> 02:02:22.607
and disappears into the snow somewhere in the distance.

02:02:22.607 --> 02:02:25.149
MARISHA: You just didn't want to go on a date, right?

02:02:25.149 --> 02:02:26.229
(laughter)

02:02:26.229 --> 02:02:27.905
ASHLEY: Yes, I do, I'm just trying

02:02:27.905 --> 02:02:30.687
to look cool like you.
TALIESIN: Would deflect

02:02:30.687 --> 02:02:31.697
have worked on that, by the way?

02:02:31.697 --> 02:02:34.455
LIAM: She's Godzilla yelling over it all.

02:02:34.455 --> 02:02:36.622
(yelling)

02:02:39.427 --> 02:02:40.397
MATT: If it had hit, maybe.

02:02:40.397 --> 02:02:41.907
ASHLEY: Okay.
MATT: It missed entirely.

02:02:41.907 --> 02:02:43.007
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, no, carry on.

02:02:43.007 --> 02:02:44.367
MATT: Technically, it would be a missile weapon,

02:02:44.367 --> 02:02:46.077
so if it did hit, she could've maybe caught the sword.

02:02:46.077 --> 02:02:47.183
TALIESIN: That would have been--
MATT: Which would have been fun.

02:02:47.183 --> 02:02:49.267
LAURA: Oh, that would have been so cool.

02:02:49.267 --> 02:02:50.100
TALIESIN: Good to know.

02:02:50.100 --> 02:02:51.672
MARISHA: True.
MATT: Yeah, but it didn't hit.

02:02:51.672 --> 02:02:53.497
MARISHA: Deflect Missiles, yeah.

02:02:53.497 --> 02:02:58.497
MATT: Okay, that finishes it.
Now, Beau and Jester, you are up.

02:02:58.727 --> 02:03:03.460
MARISHA: Okay, yeah, I am just going to pummel it some more.

02:03:04.632 --> 02:03:05.465
ASHLEY: (coughing)
SAM: Oh boy.

02:03:05.465 --> 02:03:08.067
ASHLEY: So weird. I'm not sick!

02:03:08.067 --> 02:03:09.469
(laughter)

02:03:09.469 --> 02:03:11.892
TRAVIS: Can't breathe liquid.
ASHLEY: I swallowed that weird.

02:03:11.892 --> 02:03:12.789
MARISHA: Pop pop.

02:03:14.037 --> 02:03:17.565
Okay, that first one is a 22.

02:03:17.565 --> 02:03:19.157
MATT: That hits.

02:03:19.157 --> 02:03:20.657
MARISHA: And you know what?

02:03:20.657 --> 02:03:22.917
I might as well Stunning Strike.

02:03:22.917 --> 02:03:25.357
MATT: Roll damage first.

02:03:25.357 --> 02:03:27.682
MARISHA: Lame, nine damage.

02:03:27.682 --> 02:03:28.807
MATT: Nine damage.

02:03:29.707 --> 02:03:30.967
Yeah, that is a--

02:03:30.967 --> 02:03:33.855
MARISHA: Probably not going to work.
MATT: 32.

02:03:33.855 --> 02:03:35.437
MARISHA: That sounds right.

02:03:35.437 --> 02:03:36.887
Sounds about right.

02:03:36.887 --> 02:03:37.887
MATT: Yeah.

02:03:37.887 --> 02:03:39.447
MARISHA: The second one is a 21 to hit.

02:03:39.447 --> 02:03:40.597
MATT: That hits as well.

02:03:42.917 --> 02:03:44.657
MARISHA: Lord have mercy. Okay,

02:03:44.657 --> 02:03:45.577
that's better.
SAM: You can make

02:03:45.577 --> 02:03:48.127
pull Otis around that thing and just prison shiv him.

02:03:48.127 --> 02:03:49.240
MARISHA: 14 damage.

02:03:50.247 --> 02:03:52.620
TRAVIS: While all nine eyes watch us do it.

02:03:55.767 --> 02:03:57.517
MARISHA: Stunning Strike, fuck it.
MATT: All righty.

02:03:57.517 --> 02:03:59.727
TRAVIS: The blood attacks us, we're like--

02:03:59.727 --> 02:04:01.861
MATT: That is a...

02:04:01.861 --> 02:04:03.577
34.

02:04:03.577 --> 02:04:04.790
MARISHA: Yeah, no, no, no.

02:04:04.790 --> 02:04:06.541
MATT: Rolled a 19, sorry.

02:04:09.147 --> 02:04:10.239
MARISHA: What else do I want to do here?

02:04:10.239 --> 02:04:13.894
Can I-- do I get the sense that she's

02:04:13.894 --> 02:04:16.567
rearing for another breath weapon?

02:04:16.567 --> 02:04:19.407
MATT: You get the sense she's
starting to shift into survival mode.

02:04:19.407 --> 02:04:24.277
She was caught off-guard, and is now

02:04:24.277 --> 02:04:26.920
gauging whether or not to fight or flight.

02:04:28.357 --> 02:04:29.347
MARISHA: Okay.
MATT: With your high passive

02:04:29.347 --> 02:04:31.837
instinct, I'd say, and your proximity to her,

02:04:31.837 --> 02:04:33.982
you can sense the breathing picking up.

02:04:33.982 --> 02:04:36.277
You can see the wounds and just the trajectory

02:04:36.277 --> 02:04:38.027
seems to be on that cusp, it could go either way.

02:04:38.027 --> 02:04:38.860
You're not sure.

02:04:38.860 --> 02:04:40.507
MARISHA: Okay, with that, I'm just

02:04:40.507 --> 02:04:42.950
going to bonus action, pop, pop.

02:04:44.477 --> 02:04:48.207
Those are both great, that is a natural 18 for the first one

02:04:48.207 --> 02:04:50.302
for 28 with my fists.
MATT: That hits.

02:04:50.302 --> 02:04:52.777
MARISHA: And then the next one was a 17 for 27.

02:04:52.777 --> 02:04:53.610
MATT: Go for it.

02:04:53.610 --> 02:04:58.027
MARISHA: So I want to do a Legolas and the horse,

02:04:58.027 --> 02:05:00.887
you know how he swooped around.

02:05:00.887 --> 02:05:04.077
So I want to take my staff

02:05:04.077 --> 02:05:06.597
and loop it around, I'm a loop around

02:05:06.597 --> 02:05:07.994
the front of her neck and I want to

02:05:07.994 --> 02:05:09.757
pop, pop, pop as I go by.

02:05:09.757 --> 02:05:12.579
MATT: Okay, go for it.
So you swing around the dragon's neck,

02:05:12.579 --> 02:05:14.917
kicking over and then grabbing onto the edge.

02:05:14.917 --> 02:05:17.767
You just impact twice underneath the throat area.

02:05:17.767 --> 02:05:19.999
MARISHA: And then throw myself back onto her back.

02:05:19.999 --> 02:05:20.990
MATT: Okay.

02:05:20.990 --> 02:05:24.097
MARISHA: And that damage is going to be...

02:05:25.210 --> 02:05:27.097
Oh, lord, that was horrible!

02:05:27.097 --> 02:05:30.457
A one and a two, so that's going to be seven damage

02:05:30.457 --> 02:05:32.233
for one and eight damage for the other.

02:05:32.233 --> 02:05:33.374
MATT: You got it.

02:05:33.374 --> 02:05:35.957
So you do manage to swing around, catch yourself.

02:05:35.957 --> 02:05:37.707
Doesn't quite do as much damage as you hope,

02:05:37.707 --> 02:05:39.287
but you manage to land back on the neck.

02:05:39.287 --> 02:05:40.297
No worries. Jester?

02:05:40.297 --> 02:05:42.803
MARISHA: It looked cool.
MATT: Did look cool.

02:05:42.803 --> 02:05:43.636
LAURA: Okay.

02:05:45.577 --> 02:05:50.357
I'm going to run forward.

02:05:50.357 --> 02:05:52.377
MATT: Full movement?
LAURA: But like--

02:05:52.377 --> 02:05:54.177
Yes, my full movement, I'm going to run

02:05:54.177 --> 02:05:55.937
towards that snowbank, like

02:05:55.937 --> 02:05:59.267
to the left of Fjord, you know?

02:05:59.267 --> 02:06:00.357
TRAVIS: Don't hide behind me.

02:06:00.357 --> 02:06:01.377
LAURA: No, no, no, no, no, yeah.

02:06:01.377 --> 02:06:03.577
Like, more hiding behind the spire, but like--

02:06:05.047 --> 02:06:07.537
Can I get past the snowbank or is that my--

02:06:07.537 --> 02:06:09.577
MATT: You can, but that will be
all of your movement to get there.

02:06:09.577 --> 02:06:11.007
LAURA: Can I see Fjord?

02:06:11.007 --> 02:06:13.040
MATT: You, from there,

02:06:14.717 --> 02:06:15.647
barely.

02:06:15.647 --> 02:06:17.617
TRAVIS: Yeah, I can see it.
MATT: Barely.

02:06:17.617 --> 02:06:20.747
He has three-quarters cover, but you have sight, yeah.

02:06:20.747 --> 02:06:21.580
LAURA: Okay.

02:06:23.357 --> 02:06:24.680
I'm going to--

02:06:27.577 --> 02:06:29.568
Only for you, Fjord--

02:06:29.568 --> 02:06:31.440
TALIESIN: Whoa.
SAM: What's happening?

02:06:31.440 --> 02:06:32.943
LAURA: (loud exhale)

02:06:32.943 --> 02:06:34.427
I'm going to cast Heal!

02:06:34.427 --> 02:06:36.179
SAM: Ah!
LAURA: At Fjord.

02:06:36.179 --> 02:06:38.429
(laughter)

02:06:39.460 --> 02:06:40.409
ASHLEY: What?

02:06:40.409 --> 02:06:43.184
LAURA: And you're going to regain 70 hit points!

02:06:43.184 --> 02:06:44.592
TRAVIS: What?!

02:06:44.592 --> 02:06:45.792
LAURA: I know.

02:06:45.792 --> 02:06:47.616
MATT: That day, her heart grew three sizes.

02:06:47.616 --> 02:06:48.947
(laughter)

02:06:48.947 --> 02:06:50.962
TRAVIS: She loves me.

02:06:50.962 --> 02:06:53.357
TALIESIN: Spell slot is gone.

02:06:53.357 --> 02:06:55.047
MARISHA: I like to imagine even Gelidon is like,

02:06:55.047 --> 02:06:56.440
"Oh shit."
LAURA: "Oh!"

02:06:56.440 --> 02:06:57.481
(laughter)

02:06:57.481 --> 02:06:59.094
MARISHA: Everyone on the battle field stops.

02:06:59.094 --> 02:07:02.223
MATT: Gelidon's like, "I wish I had
somebody to care for me like that."

02:07:02.223 --> 02:07:04.227
(laughter)

02:07:04.227 --> 02:07:05.766
TRAVIS: Wow!

02:07:05.766 --> 02:07:07.227
LAURA: (lip flapping)

02:07:07.227 --> 02:07:08.327
MATT: All righty.
TRAVIS: I am proud of you.

02:07:08.327 --> 02:07:09.847
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Feels good, doesn't it?

02:07:09.847 --> 02:07:12.157
TRAVIS: Healer.
LAURA: Def, whatever.

02:07:12.157 --> 02:07:13.577
(laughter)

02:07:13.577 --> 02:07:14.759
TRAVIS: Well, that softens it a bit.

02:07:14.759 --> 02:07:16.867
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: All right, there you go.

02:07:16.867 --> 02:07:18.527
That finishes your turn, Jester.

02:07:18.527 --> 02:07:20.497
It is now Gelidon's turn.

02:07:20.497 --> 02:07:22.367
Let's roll to see if--
LAURA: You're welcome.

02:07:22.367 --> 02:07:23.837
MATT: Breath weapon does not come back,

02:07:23.837 --> 02:07:26.938
which means proximity, now angrily,

02:07:26.938 --> 02:07:29.867
the claws are going to reach back for you,

02:07:29.867 --> 02:07:31.210
two attacks against you.

02:07:33.557 --> 02:07:35.457
With disadvantage because you have Patient Defense still?

02:07:35.457 --> 02:07:36.387
No, no, because you took your

02:07:36.387 --> 02:07:37.790
turn, right, okay.
MARISHA: I did, I did,

02:07:37.790 --> 02:07:40.290
I did Flurry of Blows instead.
MATT: That is age 23 to hit.

02:07:40.290 --> 02:07:41.431
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

02:07:41.431 --> 02:07:44.767
That hits.
SAM: What were you doing up there?

02:07:44.767 --> 02:07:47.337
MARISHA: Okay, probably up until now.

02:07:47.337 --> 02:07:48.497
LAURA: Yeah, this is going to be the one.

02:07:48.497 --> 02:07:49.330
MARISHA: This is going to be the one.

02:07:49.330 --> 02:07:51.607
MATT: 20 points of slashing damage from one claw.

02:07:51.607 --> 02:07:52.657
TALIESIN: Oh boy, here we go.

02:07:54.627 --> 02:07:56.957
MATT: That is a 25 to hit.

02:07:56.957 --> 02:07:57.790
MARISHA: Yep.

02:07:59.137 --> 02:07:59.970
MATT: You take

02:08:01.297 --> 02:08:02.130
another

02:08:03.077 --> 02:08:05.927
16 points of slashing damage.

02:08:05.927 --> 02:08:07.627
And what happens is the claw begins to pull

02:08:07.627 --> 02:08:08.997
and drag you off the side of the neck

02:08:08.997 --> 02:08:11.017
and as it does, the head pulls back

02:08:11.017 --> 02:08:14.197
and one thing you see is just the teeth in the mouth

02:08:14.197 --> 02:08:16.627
open up, these icicles in the back of the throat,

02:08:16.627 --> 02:08:18.947
you have this up close look of the inside

02:08:18.947 --> 02:08:20.817
of Gelidon's mouth and it is just this

02:08:20.817 --> 02:08:23.057
frozen hellscape with this dull blue glow

02:08:23.057 --> 02:08:24.427
at the very base of the gullet before

02:08:24.427 --> 02:08:27.117
it disappears in the darkness and that

02:08:28.087 --> 02:08:30.367
is going to be a 28 to hit.

02:08:30.367 --> 02:08:33.527
MARISHA: You just, last thing you hear is me go: Not again.

02:08:33.527 --> 02:08:35.050
SAM: You're going to get swallowed?

02:08:36.077 --> 02:08:37.747
Oh no!
LAURA: You're going to get swallowed?

02:08:37.747 --> 02:08:39.790
MARISHA: I don't know.
SAM: That changes things.

02:08:40.682 --> 02:08:41.990
MATT: That is going to be--
LAURA: The head can reach

02:08:41.990 --> 02:08:44.231
that far back?
MARISHA: Did you say it was--

02:08:44.231 --> 02:08:45.064
SAM: No, she used the claw.
MARISHA: Is it a bite?

02:08:45.064 --> 02:08:46.187
Was I grappled?

02:08:46.187 --> 02:08:47.177
MATT: No, no, you weren't grappled.

02:08:47.177 --> 02:08:48.167
MARISHA: I wasn't grappled.
MATT: No.

02:08:48.167 --> 02:08:50.224
MARISHA: Okay.
MATT: I'm narrating the attack.

02:08:50.224 --> 02:08:51.582
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay.

02:08:51.582 --> 02:08:53.543
MATT: That is--

02:08:53.543 --> 02:08:55.876
(laughs)

02:08:57.187 --> 02:08:59.260
17 points of piercing damage.

02:09:01.667 --> 02:09:02.500
Plus

02:09:05.167 --> 02:09:06.980
16 points of cold damage.

02:09:07.964 --> 02:09:09.887
TALIESIN: How you doin'?
TRAVIS: Where you at, where you at, where you at?

02:09:09.887 --> 02:09:11.137
SAM: But she's not swallowed.

02:09:11.137 --> 02:09:14.807
MATT: No, just, now you see her like

02:09:14.807 --> 02:09:17.027
chomped into Gelidon's mouth.

02:09:17.027 --> 02:09:19.835
You can see it crush into the sides of her body and leg.

02:09:19.835 --> 02:09:22.569
For a moment, all you can see is one arm and part of a leg

02:09:22.569 --> 02:09:24.867
and then as the teeth get pulled apart slightly,

02:09:24.867 --> 02:09:27.600
you see Beau like (grunting)
pushing out of the mouth

02:09:27.600 --> 02:09:29.467
and then managing to pull out of the side

02:09:29.467 --> 02:09:30.937
and is holding on to the side

02:09:30.937 --> 02:09:32.043
of Gelidon's head now.
MARISHA: I'm like, holding onto

02:09:32.043 --> 02:09:33.434
like, her nostril.

02:09:33.434 --> 02:09:35.457
MATT: There's blood all over her body.

02:09:35.457 --> 02:09:37.577
But the blood is now freezing to her

02:09:37.577 --> 02:09:41.694
from the sheer cold and proximity of Gelidon's mouth.

02:09:41.694 --> 02:09:43.043
MARISHA: I have 17 hit points left.
MATT: There's blood-cicles

02:09:43.043 --> 02:09:44.289
beginning to drop and freeze

02:09:44.289 --> 02:09:45.660
off the sides of her arm.
TRAVIS: 17?

02:09:45.660 --> 02:09:46.963
MARISHA: One-seven, yeah.

02:09:46.963 --> 02:09:48.596
MATT: "Blood-cicle." I haven't used that phrase ever.

02:09:48.596 --> 02:09:50.055
I like that.

02:09:51.224 --> 02:09:53.922
And Gelidon's going to fly 80 feet that way.

02:09:53.922 --> 02:09:56.077
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

02:09:56.077 --> 02:09:58.677
SAM: To escape, oh no.

02:09:58.677 --> 02:10:00.400
We need to go on hot pursuit.

02:10:01.317 --> 02:10:03.297
TALIESIN: You can--
MARISHA: It's okay.

02:10:03.297 --> 02:10:06.207
Do we want to go on, or what are we doing?

02:10:06.207 --> 02:10:09.287
TRAVIS: I mean, dragon going away, very good.

02:10:09.287 --> 02:10:11.786
Going away with you in its mouth, very bad.

02:10:11.786 --> 02:10:14.536
MATT: Lucien's turn, Lucien goes,

02:10:15.817 --> 02:10:17.862
"Well, that's a good turn of fate.

02:10:17.862 --> 02:10:19.197
"Let him have her."

02:10:19.197 --> 02:10:21.567
He goes and puts the swords

02:10:21.567 --> 02:10:24.327
onto the side and is considering this a done battle.

02:10:24.327 --> 02:10:26.394
TRAVIS: No, no, it is no, "Let her have her."

02:10:28.247 --> 02:10:30.087
MATT: "Then someone go catch her."

02:10:30.087 --> 02:10:31.387
ASHLEY: I'm going to start running.

02:10:32.597 --> 02:10:34.153
LIAM: Are we still in turn order?
MARISHA: Are we still in initiative order?

02:10:34.153 --> 02:10:36.937
MATT: We're still in initiative order here.

02:10:36.937 --> 02:10:39.077
With that, Lucien and Tyffial

02:10:39.077 --> 02:10:40.527
come out of their cover and begin to put

02:10:40.527 --> 02:10:44.487
as much distance between the dragon and them as they can.

02:10:44.487 --> 02:10:45.637
And so they're going to go ahead and start

02:10:45.637 --> 02:10:47.385
moving over this way.

02:10:47.385 --> 02:10:48.677
MARISHA: Fucking kill Otis.

02:10:48.677 --> 02:10:51.457
I got the dragon, you guys kill the Tomb Takers.

02:10:51.457 --> 02:10:53.159
SAM: I would love to kill Otis right now.

02:10:53.159 --> 02:10:54.535
MATT: Fjord, it's your turn.

02:10:56.093 --> 02:10:58.637
You can see the dragon is now quite a distance away

02:10:58.637 --> 02:11:02.132
with Beauregard bloody and nearly frozen to its side.

02:11:02.132 --> 02:11:04.937
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's a real thing.

02:11:07.549 --> 02:11:09.599
"-- at an incredible pace. When you can cast this spell,

02:11:09.599 --> 02:11:11.917
"as a bonus action on each of your turns,"

02:11:11.917 --> 02:11:14.468
So what does Expeditious Retreat do?

02:11:16.147 --> 02:11:17.427
LIAM: Speeds a person up.

02:11:17.427 --> 02:11:18.260
MATT: Yep.
LAURA: Yeah.

02:11:18.260 --> 02:11:19.907
SAM: It takes some sort of action

02:11:19.907 --> 02:11:21.357
or a bonus action to--

02:11:21.357 --> 02:11:22.821
MATT: It's a bonus action to cast, right?

02:11:22.821 --> 02:11:23.812
Or is it a reaction?
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah.

02:11:23.812 --> 02:11:25.797
I have Expeditious Retreat at 1st-level.

02:11:25.797 --> 02:11:28.677
So if my movement speed is 30 and I cast that

02:11:28.677 --> 02:11:31.964
as a bonus action, what does that get me, distance wise?

02:11:31.964 --> 02:11:33.505
LAURA: 60 feet.

02:11:33.505 --> 02:11:34.947
TRAVIS: It just doubles it like a dash?

02:11:34.947 --> 02:11:35.901
MATT: It says,

02:11:35.901 --> 02:11:37.837
well, it says, "When you cast the spell, and then as a bonus

02:11:37.837 --> 02:11:40.527
"action on each of your turns until the spell ends."

02:11:40.527 --> 02:11:41.360
Yeah, so it gives you dash.

02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:44.569
You get to move an additional 30 feet.

02:11:44.569 --> 02:11:45.587
TALIESIN: So you could do, if you--

02:11:45.587 --> 02:11:46.978
TRAVIS: So I could go 90 feet.

02:11:46.978 --> 02:11:49.267
MATT: You could go 90 feet in one turn, yeah.

02:11:49.267 --> 02:11:50.408
TRAVIS: I'll do that.

02:11:50.408 --> 02:11:51.241
MATT: Okay.

02:11:55.117 --> 02:11:58.440
That gets you just off the map this way.

02:11:59.287 --> 02:12:01.050
But that's all of your movement, action, and bonus action.

02:12:01.050 --> 02:12:03.334
TRAVIS: And about how far am I from--

02:12:04.617 --> 02:12:06.037
MATT: You're about 70 feet.

02:12:06.037 --> 02:12:07.748
TRAVIS: Wow.
SAM: About how far?

02:12:07.748 --> 02:12:09.757
TRAVIS: 70 feet away. Okay.

02:12:09.757 --> 02:12:11.967
That's, yeah, that's all my turn.
There's nothing else I can do.

02:12:11.967 --> 02:12:13.528
That's action and bonus action.
MATT: Yeah.

02:12:13.528 --> 02:12:17.397
TRAVIS: Okay.
MATT: Okay, that finishes Fjord's go. Caduceus.

02:12:17.397 --> 02:12:19.970
TALIESIN: Fuck, I'm not fast enough to get there.

02:12:21.620 --> 02:12:22.658
SAM: Believe in yourself.

02:12:22.658 --> 02:12:23.491
TALIESIN: (blows raspberry)

02:12:24.977 --> 02:12:26.947
I'm going to--
MATT: Ever so slightly this way

02:12:26.947 --> 02:12:28.039
as the battle is now

02:12:28.039 --> 02:12:29.457
shifting in that direction.

02:12:29.457 --> 02:12:31.770
SAM: You're off the volume.

02:12:32.665 --> 02:12:34.687
MARISHA: I do have options, just so everybody knows.

02:12:34.687 --> 02:12:36.417
TALIESIN: We do.
MARISHA: I have options.

02:12:36.417 --> 02:12:37.507
SAM: You have options?

02:12:37.507 --> 02:12:38.587
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:12:38.587 --> 02:12:42.144
TALIESIN: I'm going to run.

02:12:42.144 --> 02:12:44.227
I'm going to run in the direction of the dragon.

02:12:44.227 --> 02:12:45.060
MATT: Okay.

02:12:49.387 --> 02:12:51.867
TALIESIN: And--
TRAVIS: Oh, that's way better.

02:12:51.867 --> 02:12:55.367
TALIESIN: I assume I am nowhere near

02:12:55.367 --> 02:12:56.868
60 feet away.

02:12:59.597 --> 02:13:00.950
MATT: You're right on the cusp.

02:13:02.587 --> 02:13:04.410
Can try something, what do you want to try?

02:13:05.617 --> 02:13:06.887
TALIESIN: Fuck, if I try it and I fail,

02:13:06.887 --> 02:13:08.687
we're fucked, is the problem.

02:13:08.687 --> 02:13:09.647
MATT: Well.

02:13:09.647 --> 02:13:13.027
TALIESIN: I'm right on the cusp of 60 feet from Beau?

02:13:13.027 --> 02:13:13.947
MARISHA: Feel free to--

02:13:13.947 --> 02:13:15.827
MATT: From the dragon, Beau's a little further, Beau's--

02:13:15.827 --> 02:13:19.167
TALIESIN: Oh, then I'm going to fucking hold until I feel

02:13:19.167 --> 02:13:22.107
comfortable with the distance between me and Beau.

02:13:22.107 --> 02:13:23.575
MATT: Okay. What are you holding?

02:13:23.575 --> 02:13:25.287
TALIESIN: I'm going to hold Heal.

02:13:25.287 --> 02:13:26.807
MATT: Okay, you got it.

02:13:26.807 --> 02:13:27.977
MARISHA: Thank you.
MATT: All right.

02:13:27.977 --> 02:13:30.917
That finishes Caduceus' turn, Cree

02:13:30.917 --> 02:13:33.387
is going to go ahead and take a few steps back

02:13:33.387 --> 02:13:35.687
towards the others, but also is keeping an eye over there

02:13:35.687 --> 02:13:38.247
on the circumstances, like,

02:13:38.247 --> 02:13:41.737
you see keeping almost a bridge between the two groups.

02:13:41.737 --> 02:13:44.947
That finishes Cree's turn, Caleb.

02:13:44.947 --> 02:13:47.637
LIAM: I'm going to just start bolting towards Beauregard.

02:13:47.637 --> 02:13:49.567
I'll use all of my movement in a diagonal line,

02:13:49.567 --> 02:13:51.277
straight towards Gelidon.

02:13:51.277 --> 02:13:52.365
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: And as I do,

02:13:52.365 --> 02:13:54.687
I will rip the catmint out of my pouch

02:13:54.687 --> 02:13:57.657
and I will throw my hand in a hucking motion

02:13:57.657 --> 02:14:00.227
and a spectral Frumpkin goes spinning

02:14:00.227 --> 02:14:03.257
in an arc towards Gelidon, 120 feet

02:14:03.257 --> 02:14:05.497
and turns into a giant cat claw on the way

02:14:05.497 --> 02:14:09.447
and I would like to grapple Beauregard off of the dragon.

02:14:09.447 --> 02:14:11.590
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make an attack on that.

02:14:13.127 --> 02:14:15.477
LIAM: "A grasping hand can grasp

02:14:15.477 --> 02:14:18.007
"a huge or smaller creature within five feet of it.

02:14:18.007 --> 02:14:18.880
"If the target,"

02:14:20.357 --> 02:14:21.877
that's if she's an enemy though, right?

02:14:21.877 --> 02:14:23.547
If she goes with it--
MATT: Well, a target.

02:14:23.547 --> 02:14:25.527
She goes with it, but that's the question for her.

02:14:25.527 --> 02:14:26.360
LIAM: Okay.

02:14:26.360 --> 02:14:27.452
MATT: Do you go with it or do you fight to stay?

02:14:27.452 --> 02:14:29.437
LIAM: Do you want to be pulled off the dragon?

02:14:29.437 --> 02:14:33.117
MARISHA: I don't know what's happening, but yes.

02:14:33.117 --> 02:14:35.440
MATT: You just see this giant cat claw coming towards you.

02:14:35.440 --> 02:14:37.440
MARISHA: I have plans to jump on my turn.

02:14:39.127 --> 02:14:40.117
LIAM: Tell me what you want to do.

02:14:40.117 --> 02:14:42.587
I'm trying to, I'm going to try to envelop you in a hand.

02:14:42.587 --> 02:14:43.420
MARISHA: Try it.

02:14:44.477 --> 02:14:46.887
LIAM: Well, it's up to you if it's a roll or not.

02:14:46.887 --> 02:14:48.387
MATT: Are you allowing it to happen or are you fighting it?

02:14:48.387 --> 02:14:49.627
MARISHA: I'll allow it, yeah.

02:14:49.627 --> 02:14:53.487
MATT: Okay, so without issue, the cat's claw reaches up,

02:14:53.487 --> 02:14:56.737
wraps around Beauregard and pulls.

02:14:56.737 --> 02:14:58.987
When it pulls, you hear this snapping sound.

02:14:58.987 --> 02:15:01.607
The blood that is pouring down Gelidon's neck,

02:15:01.607 --> 02:15:03.567
which right now is mostly Beauregard's

02:15:03.567 --> 02:15:05.807
has frozen to Beauregard's hand and arm

02:15:05.807 --> 02:15:07.527
and was what was keeping her aloft.

02:15:07.527 --> 02:15:09.300
So as the cat's claw pulls,

02:15:10.137 --> 02:15:12.497
she pulls off and the actual ice breaks

02:15:12.497 --> 02:15:14.687
off of your hand, your blood has now left behind this

02:15:14.687 --> 02:15:18.207
print of frozen dark crimson on the side of its throat.

02:15:18.207 --> 02:15:20.557
But you are currently held

02:15:21.587 --> 02:15:22.597
by the claw.

02:15:22.597 --> 02:15:24.237
MARISHA: Okay.

02:15:24.237 --> 02:15:25.157
LIAM: And that's it, that's the end of my turn.

02:15:25.157 --> 02:15:26.157
MATT: That's your turn.
TALIESIN: You can't start

02:15:26.157 --> 02:15:27.597
pulling her back or--

02:15:27.597 --> 02:15:30.407
LIAM: I don't think so, I think on my next turn,

02:15:30.407 --> 02:15:31.894
I get 60 feet of movement on it.

02:15:31.894 --> 02:15:34.502
MATT: Exactly. That brings us to Veth,

02:15:34.502 --> 02:15:36.539
and Yasha's after that.

02:15:36.539 --> 02:15:40.527
SAM: I will say to Otis in Halfling:

02:15:40.527 --> 02:15:43.427
Come, help save my friend!

02:15:43.427 --> 02:15:48.367
And I will run 30 feet and then 60 feet.

02:15:48.367 --> 02:15:49.757
I think that brings me within range

02:15:49.757 --> 02:15:51.717
and I will fire a crossbow bolt.

02:15:51.717 --> 02:15:53.347
MATT: 60 feet.

02:15:53.347 --> 02:15:55.949
Okay, so yeah, you dash over there.

02:15:55.949 --> 02:15:57.644
What's your range on your crossbow?

02:15:57.644 --> 02:16:00.910
SAM: It's 30/120,

02:16:00.910 --> 02:16:03.097
but I have some feat that makes

02:16:03.097 --> 02:16:05.047
long range not impose a--
MATT: Sharpshooter, right?

02:16:05.047 --> 02:16:07.020
So yeah, you can go ahead and take the shot.

02:16:08.828 --> 02:16:11.311
LIAM: Take a shot.
SAM: Ooh, three.

02:16:12.447 --> 02:16:14.097
MATT: Goes wide.
SAM: Damn it.

02:16:14.097 --> 02:16:15.987
MATT: The open air, too much blue.

02:16:15.987 --> 02:16:18.267
and the chaos with Beauregard.

02:16:18.267 --> 02:16:21.141
You just shoot angrily and--

02:16:21.141 --> 02:16:23.167
SAM: I look to see if Otis is following.

02:16:23.167 --> 02:16:24.962
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

02:16:24.962 --> 02:16:27.407
SAM: A persuasion check.

02:16:27.407 --> 02:16:29.397
16

02:16:29.397 --> 02:16:32.457
plus three?! When did I get plus three on persuasion?

02:16:32.457 --> 02:16:34.277
TALIESIN: I hate to say this,

02:16:34.277 --> 02:16:36.557
but that's a skill roll, isn't it?

02:16:36.557 --> 02:16:38.109
SAM: But I'm not--
MATT: He doesn't have exhaustion.

02:16:38.109 --> 02:16:40.147
TALIESIN: Fuck yes, never mind.
MATT: He had the tea. Yeah.

02:16:40.147 --> 02:16:42.087
SAM: 19.
MATT: Okay.

02:16:42.087 --> 02:16:43.548
Otis seems to be paying attention.

02:16:43.548 --> 02:16:45.437
SAM: (gasping)
(laughter)

02:16:45.437 --> 02:16:47.837
It's not Otis' turn, but Otis is definitely looking at you.

02:16:47.837 --> 02:16:49.618
Like, you know, cloak over, like.

02:16:49.618 --> 02:16:51.047
(heavy breathing)

02:16:51.047 --> 02:16:52.167
SAM: Okay, okay.

02:16:52.167 --> 02:16:54.887
MATT: All right, that finishes your turn. Yasha, you're up.

02:16:54.887 --> 02:16:59.117
ASHLEY: Okay, so can I see Skingorger anywhere?

02:16:59.117 --> 02:17:00.457
MATT: You would have to go search, it is lost

02:17:00.457 --> 02:17:02.467
in a powdered snow in a distance.

02:17:02.467 --> 02:17:04.777
That would be an after-combat search.

02:17:04.777 --> 02:17:06.627
It'll take you a while to re-find it.

02:17:08.547 --> 02:17:10.988
ASHLEY: Okay. Well then.

02:17:13.905 --> 02:17:15.571
SAM: (grunt of exertion)

02:17:15.571 --> 02:17:16.894
ASHLEY: I'll just start running.

02:17:17.752 --> 02:17:19.967
LAURA: (laughs)

02:17:19.967 --> 02:17:22.810
ASHLEY: And because I don't think I was hit on this round.

02:17:25.291 --> 02:17:26.624
MATT: There you go, that's 50 feet there.

02:17:26.624 --> 02:17:28.242
ASHLEY: I will rage.

02:17:28.242 --> 02:17:29.692
MATT: Okay, bonus action to rage.

02:17:30.630 --> 02:17:32.030
ASHLEY: (frustrated growl)

02:17:33.600 --> 02:17:34.650
TALIESIN: (nervous noise)

02:17:35.678 --> 02:17:37.511
ASHLEY: I can't do anything!

02:17:39.337 --> 02:17:42.401
SAM: I Can't Do Anything: The Ashley Johnson Story.

02:17:42.401 --> 02:17:43.817
(laughter)

02:17:43.817 --> 02:17:45.917
ASHLEY: No, I don't want that to be my story!

02:17:45.917 --> 02:17:48.197
TALIESIN: Flying enemies.
MATT: Flying enemies are the bane

02:17:48.197 --> 02:17:49.947
of melee classes.
MARISHA: They're the worst.

02:17:49.947 --> 02:17:52.267
ASHLEY: I know, I'm just wondering if, oh, oh, oh.

02:17:52.267 --> 02:17:54.177
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

02:17:54.177 --> 02:17:56.107
LAURA: Yeah.

02:17:56.107 --> 02:17:58.916
ASHLEY: Okay, I have a large lance.

02:17:58.916 --> 02:18:00.097
MARISHA: Yes!
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:18:00.097 --> 02:18:04.717
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'm going to just going to try to chuck it.

02:18:04.717 --> 02:18:05.897
And reckless.
LIAM: Oh, I forgot

02:18:05.897 --> 02:18:07.546
about this lance here.

02:18:07.546 --> 02:18:09.126
(laughter)

02:18:09.126 --> 02:18:10.267
MATT: D&amp;D.

02:18:10.267 --> 02:18:13.765
(laughter)

02:18:13.765 --> 02:18:14.779
All right.

02:18:14.779 --> 02:18:16.580
SAM: This eight-foot barbed lance

02:18:16.580 --> 02:18:18.627
on my back.
ASHLEY: Whoa, what's this?

02:18:18.627 --> 02:18:20.767
(laughter)

02:18:20.767 --> 02:18:23.947
MARISHA: This has been in my inventory the whole time?

02:18:23.947 --> 02:18:25.521
LIAM: It was under those herbs.

02:18:25.521 --> 02:18:26.467
(laughter)

02:18:26.467 --> 02:18:29.317
SAM: I have a whole set of silverware, apparently,

02:18:29.317 --> 02:18:30.926
that I carry around with me wherever I--

02:18:30.926 --> 02:18:32.997
LAURA: That you stole?
MATT: Is it a lance or javelin?

02:18:32.997 --> 02:18:34.747
SAM: Ages ago, like four sets of silverware.

02:18:34.747 --> 02:18:37.707
ASHLEY: It says "large lance" would that not--

02:18:37.707 --> 02:18:40.653
If that doesn't work, I have another idea.
MATT: No, I'll allow it, I'll allow it.

02:18:40.653 --> 02:18:41.987
So you're doing reckless?

02:18:41.987 --> 02:18:42.820
ASHLEY: I'm doing reckless.

02:18:42.820 --> 02:18:44.467
MATT: So that'll make it a straight roll, as opposed

02:18:44.467 --> 02:18:47.027
to the disadvantage it would be.

02:18:47.027 --> 02:18:49.217
ASHLEY: 'Kay.
MARISHA: Yeah, Yasha!

02:18:49.217 --> 02:18:50.177
ASHLEY: Why not, why not, why not?

02:18:50.177 --> 02:18:51.617
TALIESIN: Either a 20 or a one at this point.

02:18:51.617 --> 02:18:52.747
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: Come on.

02:18:52.747 --> 02:18:54.137
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:18:54.137 --> 02:18:56.123
MARISHA: Is it a 20?
ASHLEY: It's a 17.

02:18:56.123 --> 02:18:58.537
MARISHA: Okay.
ASHLEY: Plus anything?

02:18:58.537 --> 02:19:00.307
MATT: Plus, whatever your attack bonus is.

02:19:00.307 --> 02:19:01.385
ASHLEY: Oh my attack bonus?

02:19:01.385 --> 02:19:02.587
MATT: Yeah, you still get your attack bonus.

02:19:02.587 --> 02:19:03.420
ASHLEY: Which is my--

02:19:05.466 --> 02:19:06.774
TRAVIS: Strength modifier.
ASHLEY: Strength modifier,

02:19:06.774 --> 02:19:07.977
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

02:19:07.977 --> 02:19:09.487
MATT: Okay, yeah, you hit.
ASHLEY: Okay, 21, 21.

02:19:09.487 --> 02:19:11.577
MATT: Yeah, it's tired night, you hit.

02:19:11.577 --> 02:19:12.933
ASHLEY: Okay.
MATT: So go ahead and roll damage for the lance.

02:19:12.933 --> 02:19:16.189
As you chuck it, as you run

02:19:16.189 --> 02:19:17.647
and just chuck it.

02:19:17.647 --> 02:19:19.047
You see it bending in the air

02:19:19.047 --> 02:19:20.831
as it goes wobbling.

02:19:20.831 --> 02:19:22.755
SAM: Like Revenge Of The Nerds?
MATT: Yeah.

02:19:22.755 --> 02:19:25.157
(laughter)

02:19:25.157 --> 02:19:27.257
ASHLEY: What do I roll for lance?

02:19:27.257 --> 02:19:28.090
MATT: That's right, because you don't have the lance--

02:19:28.090 --> 02:19:30.132
LIAM: Roll for lance.

02:19:30.132 --> 02:19:32.057
MATT: Go ahead and roll, I think if I saw it earlier

02:19:32.057 --> 02:19:35.687
it was a d12, but I'll double check that.

02:19:35.687 --> 02:19:36.976
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: d12.

02:19:36.976 --> 02:19:39.089
ASHLEY: d12, okay.
LAURA: Wow, lance is a big--

02:19:39.089 --> 02:19:41.479
MATT: I'll say do not add your strength modifier to it.

02:19:41.479 --> 02:19:44.483
Just your rage damage, just because you're not--

02:19:44.483 --> 02:19:45.424
MATT: Yeah.
TRAVIS: It's just a little bit

02:19:45.424 --> 02:19:47.077
of a weird circumstance, lances aren't necessarily

02:19:47.077 --> 02:19:49.247
meant to be thrown, but I'm allowing it and I'm just

02:19:49.247 --> 02:19:50.767
shifting that. So just roll the d12

02:19:50.767 --> 02:19:53.067
and then add your rage damage.

02:19:53.067 --> 02:19:53.900
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:19:55.537 --> 02:19:57.093
SAM: How do you want to do this?

02:19:57.093 --> 02:19:59.615
MARISHA: I hope so. How epic.

02:20:00.767 --> 02:20:02.857
ASHLEY: That would be seven.

02:20:02.857 --> 02:20:05.097
MATT: Seven damage.
LAURA: Woo-hoo!

02:20:05.097 --> 02:20:06.087
Worth it.
SAM: Damn!

02:20:06.087 --> 02:20:08.667
MATT: Awesome, so it just sticks into its chest

02:20:08.667 --> 02:20:10.757
and you see it now, it gets a good, like, two, three feet

02:20:10.757 --> 02:20:12.309
in and it's now just sticking out and the dragon.

02:20:12.309 --> 02:20:16.338
(growling) (roaring)

02:20:16.338 --> 02:20:17.521
(wings flapping)

02:20:17.521 --> 02:20:19.047
All right, does that finish your turn?

02:20:19.047 --> 02:20:21.686
ASHLEY: Do I get a second hit?

02:20:21.686 --> 02:20:22.835
TRAVIS: With what?

02:20:22.835 --> 02:20:24.607
MARISHA: With my other lance!

02:20:24.607 --> 02:20:26.475
LIAM: You just had an Olympic moment.

02:20:26.475 --> 02:20:27.383
ASHLEY: Oh, oh, hold on.

02:20:27.383 --> 02:20:29.158
I have the fire grenades.

02:20:30.447 --> 02:20:31.667
Can I try to just--

02:20:31.667 --> 02:20:34.117
MATT: I will-- nah, nah.

02:20:34.117 --> 02:20:35.197
(laughter)

02:20:35.197 --> 02:20:36.288
LIAM: Next round, Nydoorin.

02:20:36.288 --> 02:20:37.886
MATT: Next round, though.
ASHLEY: I just saw it after.

02:20:37.886 --> 02:20:39.197
MATT: No, good call.

02:20:39.197 --> 02:20:41.102
I appreciate the negotiation.

02:20:41.102 --> 02:20:42.235
TRAVIS: I throw my bag.

02:20:42.235 --> 02:20:43.151
(laughter)

02:20:43.151 --> 02:20:44.352
MATT: Fuck you, dragon!

02:20:44.352 --> 02:20:46.967
TRAVIS: (quick impacts)

02:20:46.967 --> 02:20:47.967
MATT: I love it.

02:20:47.967 --> 02:20:50.577
All right, that finishes Yasha's go.

02:20:50.577 --> 02:20:52.897
Beauregard and Jester, you guys are up.

02:20:52.897 --> 02:20:55.407
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to get purchase

02:20:55.407 --> 02:20:59.477
on the cat paw a little bit, surf it.

02:20:59.477 --> 02:21:04.477
And I enacted my Maelstrom Gloves at the top of this.

02:21:04.537 --> 02:21:06.737
MATT: Exactly, so you still have a 20-foot distance.

02:21:06.737 --> 02:21:08.378
MARISHA: While I'm at this 20-foot distance,

02:21:08.378 --> 02:21:11.620
I'm going to (punches) with my lightning.

02:21:12.747 --> 02:21:15.577
So for the lightning, yeah, those should both hit.

02:21:15.577 --> 02:21:18.767
That is a 20 for the first one and a 23 for the second.

02:21:18.767 --> 02:21:19.600
MATT: Both hit.

02:21:20.567 --> 02:21:21.400
MARISHA: Okay.

02:21:22.457 --> 02:21:25.137
SAM: You guys ever get that feeling when we're playing,

02:21:25.137 --> 02:21:26.827
where like, suddenly, you're like,

02:21:26.827 --> 02:21:28.935
"Ah, fuck, I hope this doesn't end."

02:21:29.863 --> 02:21:31.288
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:21:31.288 --> 02:21:33.384
MARISHA: All the time.
SAM: I just had one of those.

02:21:33.384 --> 02:21:36.427
MARISHA: Okay, that's okay, 12 for the first one.

02:21:36.427 --> 02:21:37.260
MATT: All right, 12 damage.

02:21:37.260 --> 02:21:39.439
MARISHA: And 10 for the second.

02:21:39.439 --> 02:21:40.455
MATT: 10 for the second, all righty.

02:21:40.455 --> 02:21:41.513
MARISHA: So 22 total.

02:21:47.217 --> 02:21:49.077
Yeah, pop, pop, why not?

02:21:49.077 --> 02:21:50.557
MATT: Go for it.
MARISHA: Why not?

02:21:50.557 --> 02:21:52.147
SAM: Wait, you can attack from there?

02:21:52.147 --> 02:21:54.306
LAURA: Yeah, she's got her--
MARISHA: I got my lightning gloves.

02:21:54.306 --> 02:21:56.077
MATT: She's shadow boxing

02:21:56.077 --> 02:21:59.470
and with each punch, a bolt of energy,
like electricity, goes (sparking)

02:21:59.470 --> 02:22:01.757
LAURA: Because she's Beau, Beau, Beau, Beau, Beau.

02:22:01.757 --> 02:22:03.427
MARISHA: Fuckin' Beau, fuckin' Beauregard,

02:22:03.427 --> 02:22:05.010
That's a fuckin' natural 20!

02:22:05.010 --> 02:22:07.247
MATT: Yeah!
TRAVIS: What?

02:22:07.247 --> 02:22:09.337
MARISHA: And a 17.
TRAVIS: That is a record.

02:22:09.337 --> 02:22:12.587
It's got to be.
MATT: You guys are rolling crazy in this.

02:22:12.587 --> 02:22:13.587
This is nuts.
MARISHA: So they both hit

02:22:13.587 --> 02:22:15.877
for the natural 20.

02:22:15.877 --> 02:22:18.157
That's good, that is a six on that roll.

02:22:18.157 --> 02:22:21.197
So 12 plus another six,

02:22:21.197 --> 02:22:23.557
so, 18 damage for the crit.

02:22:23.557 --> 02:22:24.577
MATT: Nice.

02:22:24.577 --> 02:22:26.868
MARISHA: And then for the other one,

02:22:26.868 --> 02:22:30.050
that's a seven. So that is 13 damage.

02:22:30.050 --> 02:22:31.150
MATT: You got it.
TRAVIS: This means you have

02:22:31.150 --> 02:22:32.766
to have the mustache forever.

02:22:32.766 --> 02:22:34.017
SAM: Oh no.
MATT: All right.

02:22:34.017 --> 02:22:35.437
MATT: That finish your turn?
LIAM: That's our lucky charm?

02:22:35.437 --> 02:22:36.971
MARISHA: And then--
LIAM: No deal.

02:22:36.971 --> 02:22:38.020
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:22:38.020 --> 02:22:42.016
MARISHA: How far away am I from Caduceus?

02:22:43.257 --> 02:22:45.607
MATT: You're probably a good 50 or so feet from him.

02:22:45.607 --> 02:22:48.387
55 now.
TALIESIN: Oh, 50 feet now?

02:22:48.387 --> 02:22:49.220
MATT: Now you would be, yeah.

02:22:49.220 --> 02:22:50.357
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm going to let loose.

02:22:50.357 --> 02:22:52.237
MATT: Since the claw pulled her away.

02:22:52.237 --> 02:22:54.197
TALIESIN: Yeah, it feels about right,
I'm letting loose then.

02:22:54.197 --> 02:22:55.257
MATT: Okay.

02:22:55.257 --> 02:22:56.744
TALIESIN: You go up 80.

02:22:56.744 --> 02:22:58.177
MARISHA: I go up 80.
SAM: 80?!

02:22:58.177 --> 02:22:59.527
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: I was going to drop out of this,

02:22:59.527 --> 02:23:01.477
but now I'm going to stay.
LAURA: His Heal's better than my Heal.

02:23:01.477 --> 02:23:03.177
TRAVIS: No, baby.
LIAM: It's because he practiced.

02:23:03.177 --> 02:23:04.627
TALIESIN: Don't let it ride too long.

02:23:06.087 --> 02:23:09.017
That was a big spell;
I don't have a lot left.

02:23:09.017 --> 02:23:10.091
I got lots of the little shit.
MARISHA: Let's kill

02:23:10.091 --> 02:23:11.116
an ancient dragon.
SAM: I love the guilt clerics.

02:23:11.116 --> 02:23:12.910
LIAM: You're fighting an ancient dragon.

02:23:12.910 --> 02:23:14.727
You're fighting an ancient dragon, that's what it's for.

02:23:15.682 --> 02:23:18.205
MATT: Caduceus, just confirming, 80 as opposed to 70?

02:23:18.205 --> 02:23:19.054
Because this spell heals 70.

02:23:19.054 --> 02:23:20.980
TALIESIN: I was out of 6th-level spells,

02:23:20.980 --> 02:23:23.063
so I had to burn my seventh.
MATT: Oh, so you put it up higher?

02:23:23.063 --> 02:23:24.646
You got it, okay.

02:23:26.299 --> 02:23:28.897
MARISHA: Thanks, dude, I won't die, I promise.

02:23:28.897 --> 02:23:30.471
MATT: Finish your turn?

02:23:30.471 --> 02:23:31.304
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.
MATT: Okay, as you're like,

02:23:31.304 --> 02:23:32.397
"Yeah, Caduceus!"

02:23:32.397 --> 02:23:33.947
Caduceus, you watch as the tail

02:23:34.847 --> 02:23:37.097
comes swinging around from behind Beauregard.

02:23:38.107 --> 02:23:39.972
That is going to a 28 to hit.

02:23:39.972 --> 02:23:42.544
TRAVIS: Please T-ball off her.

02:23:42.544 --> 02:23:43.519
MARISHA: Here we go!

02:23:43.519 --> 02:23:45.277
TALIESIN: Is it you or the hand that is--

02:23:45.277 --> 02:23:46.579
MARISHA: Well.
TALIESIN: Eh.

02:23:46.579 --> 02:23:48.367
LIAM: I mean, I have her grappled, but I think the fact that

02:23:48.367 --> 02:23:51.832
you stood up and surfed on that kind of fudges that.

02:23:51.832 --> 02:23:55.557
MATT: 24 points of bludgeoning damage

02:23:55.557 --> 02:23:59.870
and I would like you to make a strength saving throw.

02:24:01.137 --> 02:24:02.537
MARISHA: Sure it's not dex?

02:24:02.537 --> 02:24:04.087
MATT: I'm sure, this is about holding on.

02:24:04.087 --> 02:24:06.756
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MARISHA: That's a two.

02:24:06.756 --> 02:24:09.386
MATT: So you're going, "Thanks, Caduceus!"

02:24:09.386 --> 02:24:10.704
(laughter)

02:24:10.704 --> 02:24:12.567
And just gets baseball batted off.

02:24:12.567 --> 02:24:13.967
The cat's claw is just there and you just see

02:24:13.967 --> 02:24:17.148
this light blue blur. The streaks go (quick whoosh),

02:24:17.148 --> 02:24:21.291
and Beau is just like, full on, "Ya-hooey!" off the side.

02:24:21.291 --> 02:24:23.087
MARISHA: Which way am I getting flung?

02:24:23.087 --> 02:24:24.773
MATT: This way.
MARISHA: All right.

02:24:24.773 --> 02:24:25.606
MATT: And the tail swung.
LIAM: Hi, doggy,

02:24:25.606 --> 02:24:26.805
you're my favorite customer.

02:24:26.805 --> 02:24:28.492
(laughter)

02:24:28.492 --> 02:24:32.197
SAM: Can I do a reaction Feather Fall?

02:24:32.197 --> 02:24:34.714
MATT: You can.
SAM: I will do a reaction Feather Fall.

02:24:34.714 --> 02:24:37.477
MATT: So you (whoosh) and begin
gliding softly through the air

02:24:37.477 --> 02:24:39.017
at this odd angle.

02:24:39.017 --> 02:24:41.147
MARISHA: I guess I wouldn't get a chance

02:24:41.147 --> 02:24:43.667
to take my reaction on him, no, no, no.

02:24:43.667 --> 02:24:46.937
Because he hit me. Never mind.
MATT: No, no, no, no, no. Mm-mm.

02:24:46.937 --> 02:24:47.770
TRAVIS: That's fuckin'--

02:24:47.770 --> 02:24:50.597
MATT: So you're just like, your vision is blurred.

02:24:50.597 --> 02:24:53.357
The world is just this kaleidoscope of images

02:24:53.357 --> 02:24:56.700
and suddenly you just softly pillow land in soft snow.

02:24:57.537 --> 02:24:59.128
MARISHA: Just do a snow angel.

02:24:59.128 --> 02:25:01.724
MATT: (laughs)

02:25:01.724 --> 02:25:03.751
All right, that finishes--
MARISHA: And nod.

02:25:05.217 --> 02:25:06.297
MATT: -- your go. Jester.

02:25:06.297 --> 02:25:08.877
LAURA: I guess I'll run for it as much as I can.

02:25:08.877 --> 02:25:11.934
MATT: All righty, that puts you--

02:25:14.781 --> 02:25:18.387
30, that's as close as you can get there on one.
LAURA: Does it feel about 120 feet?

02:25:18.387 --> 02:25:19.577
MATT: You don't know.

02:25:22.040 --> 02:25:25.382
LAURA: I don't know, because Fjord ran 90.

02:25:28.157 --> 02:25:29.373
TALIESIN: I mean--

02:25:29.373 --> 02:25:31.187
MATT: It looks like it's a little far.

02:25:31.187 --> 02:25:32.450
LAURA: It seems far.

02:25:35.208 --> 02:25:36.183
I don't think I can do it.

02:25:36.183 --> 02:25:37.628
TRAVIS: It's right on the cusp.

02:25:38.837 --> 02:25:40.620
LAURA: We're not going to try to keep attacking this thing.

02:25:40.620 --> 02:25:42.620
TRAVIS: If it's going to leave, we're going to let it.

02:25:42.620 --> 02:25:45.478
ASHLEY: I summoned this bitch, we're going to end her!

02:25:45.478 --> 02:25:50.478
(laughter)

02:25:50.527 --> 02:25:51.977
MATT: I love you, Ashley Johnson.

02:25:53.707 --> 02:25:56.525
LAURA: Does she look like she's bleeding a lot?

02:25:56.525 --> 02:25:58.649
MATT: Looks like she's pretty damn hurt, yeah.

02:25:58.649 --> 02:26:00.545
LAURA: Really?

02:26:00.545 --> 02:26:02.972
TRAVIS: "Pretty damn hurt" ain't rough, though.

02:26:03.817 --> 02:26:06.292
MATT: You're not very familiar with dragon anatomy,

02:26:06.292 --> 02:26:08.300
you're not sure if it's, like, (lightly) pretty hurt,

02:26:08.300 --> 02:26:09.134
or like (intensely) pretty hurt,

02:26:09.134 --> 02:26:11.757
or like (seriously) pretty hurt.
LAURA: I'm going to try to Dimension Door inside of it.

02:26:11.757 --> 02:26:13.573
No, I'm just kidding.

02:26:14.497 --> 02:26:15.785
LIAM: Bye.
TRAVIS: Most of the blood

02:26:15.785 --> 02:26:17.477
on it is from other people.

02:26:17.477 --> 02:26:18.577
MATT: Some of it is, yeah.

02:26:24.117 --> 02:26:26.257
Whatchu doing, Jester?

02:26:26.257 --> 02:26:27.090
LAURA: I'm going to--

02:26:28.553 --> 02:26:31.327
(lip flapping)

02:26:31.327 --> 02:26:34.687
I'm going to take stock and look around

02:26:34.687 --> 02:26:37.427
and see if anybody else is around me that's hurt.

02:26:37.427 --> 02:26:39.722
MATT: Otis is looking a little hurt.

02:26:39.722 --> 02:26:40.555
SAM: Otis.

02:26:41.988 --> 02:26:44.007
TRAVIS: (whispers) This is your chance.

02:26:44.007 --> 02:26:45.727
SAM: Let me heal you, Otis.

02:26:45.727 --> 02:26:47.653
LAURA: I know, I know.
TRAVIS: Inflict Wounds!

02:26:47.653 --> 02:26:49.195
(laughter)

02:26:50.110 --> 02:26:51.297
MATT: Are you just taking stock?

02:26:51.297 --> 02:26:54.167
LAURA: I'm just going to stop running and take stock.

02:26:54.167 --> 02:26:55.707
MATT: It's now Gelidon's turn.

02:26:55.707 --> 02:26:58.857
Gelidon, now absolved of all the recent attacks,

02:26:58.857 --> 02:27:01.197
just goes into a full run or full fly,

02:27:01.197 --> 02:27:05.329
160 feet away and is just in full flight mode now.

02:27:05.329 --> 02:27:09.133
(flapping wings receding)

02:27:09.133 --> 02:27:11.801
ASHLEY: Yeah, you run!

02:27:11.801 --> 02:27:13.572
MATT: You hear the distant roar.

02:27:13.572 --> 02:27:14.555
(roaring)

02:27:14.555 --> 02:27:17.197
echo through the nearby valley

02:27:17.197 --> 02:27:19.437
and just watch the image of the white dragon

02:27:19.437 --> 02:27:21.190
begin to vanish into the horizon.

02:27:25.052 --> 02:27:26.052
And that's where we're going to take a break.

02:27:26.052 --> 02:27:27.287
ALL: Oh!

02:27:27.287 --> 02:27:28.767
ASHLEY: Oh my god, we haven't even taken a break yet.

02:27:28.767 --> 02:27:30.207
TALIESIN: Nope.
MATT: Nope.

02:27:30.207 --> 02:27:34.226
That was a full-on battle I wasn't expecting to happen.

02:27:34.226 --> 02:27:35.862
Look at you, yeah.

02:27:35.862 --> 02:27:37.687
TRAVIS: That was awesome.

02:27:37.687 --> 02:27:38.757
TALIESIN: Man.
LAURA: Oh my god.

02:27:38.757 --> 02:27:39.590
TALIESIN: I will admit I was--
LIAM: Nothing to show for it.

02:27:39.590 --> 02:27:40.841
TALIESIN: -- really hoping we were going to down that thing.

02:27:40.841 --> 02:27:42.129
TRAVIS: Ancient white dragon.
LAURA: I know, right?

02:27:42.129 --> 02:27:43.877
TALIESIN: We did okay.
TRAVIS: We got to see

02:27:43.877 --> 02:27:45.947
exactly what they can do.

02:27:45.947 --> 02:27:48.597
ASHLEY: That was a good practice.
TALIESIN: That was really helpful.

02:27:48.597 --> 02:27:49.952
MATT: Interesting intel came out of that.

02:27:49.952 --> 02:27:51.184
LIAM: Yeah, legendary action

02:27:51.184 --> 02:27:52.880
is no longer a surprise.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:27:52.880 --> 02:27:53.997
TRAVIS: Had the numbers.

02:27:53.997 --> 02:27:55.697
MATT: We'll be back here in a few minutes.

02:27:55.697 --> 02:27:57.994
We're going to take this break,
so we'll see you guys here shortly.

02:28:05.440 --> 02:28:07.685
Hi, I'm Sandy Peterson.

02:28:07.685 --> 02:28:10.569
I designed the "Call of Cthulhu" role-playing game

02:28:10.569 --> 02:28:13.390
and I have a long pedigree in role-playing.

02:28:13.390 --> 02:28:15.230
I've done lots of role-playing games.

02:28:15.230 --> 02:28:17.860
And in fact, lately I've created hundreds of pages

02:28:17.860 --> 02:28:21.580
of Cthulhu Mythos sourcebooks for 5e Fantasy.

02:28:21.580 --> 02:28:23.280
Now you can experience the dread

02:28:23.280 --> 02:28:25.250
of the mythos your fantasy game.

02:28:25.250 --> 02:28:27.780
We already have three complete

02:28:27.780 --> 02:28:30.080
Cthulhu Mythos campaigns for 5e.

02:28:30.080 --> 02:28:33.877
That's 12 hardcore volumes that you can order right now.

02:28:33.877 --> 02:28:37.550
"Ghoul Island," "Yig Snake Granddaddy," and "Dark worlds."

02:28:37.550 --> 02:28:41.690
Now, our new Cthulhu Mythos saga is titled "The Big Sleep."

02:28:41.690 --> 02:28:43.880
No, it's not a detective story,

02:28:43.880 --> 02:28:46.560
but it takes the classic adventure arc

02:28:46.560 --> 02:28:48.960
of fighting the big bad, and it supercharges it.

02:28:51.160 --> 02:28:54.447
Peterson Games' new Cthulhu Mythos saga,

02:28:54.447 --> 02:28:57.910
"The Big Sleep," is about the most slothful

02:28:57.910 --> 02:29:01.383
and gluttonous of the Great Old Ones, Tsathoggua.

02:29:02.230 --> 02:29:06.770
The world is plunged into a literal war for survival

02:29:06.770 --> 02:29:09.710
against the Sleeper himself.

02:29:09.710 --> 02:29:12.740
Will his ravenous appetite eat every single

02:29:12.740 --> 02:29:15.220
living thing on the face of the earth,

02:29:15.220 --> 02:29:17.360
or can he be stopped?

02:29:17.360 --> 02:29:21.360
Find out in "The Big Sleep," a four-volume campaign

02:29:21.360 --> 02:29:24.020
which will keep your players on their toes

02:29:24.020 --> 02:29:25.880
for months on end.

02:29:25.880 --> 02:29:29.520
Subscribe now and get fresh horror

02:29:29.520 --> 02:29:32.973

02:29:40.120 --> 02:29:42.230
Hey Critters, Laura Bailey here.

02:29:42.230 --> 02:29:44.623
Let's see what's up in the Critical Role shop.

02:29:46.770 --> 02:29:49.323
Oh my gosh, it's so amazing.

02:29:53.320 --> 02:29:55.620
Can you put donuts in this?

02:29:55.620 --> 02:29:57.913
I don't know, only one way to find out.

02:30:00.080 --> 02:30:01.500
Hey, look at these.

02:30:01.500 --> 02:30:02.663
They go on your face.

02:30:05.663 --> 02:30:07.887
The cuteness, it's overpowering.

02:30:10.930 --> 02:30:13.160
Darling, I recommend buying two.

02:30:13.160 --> 02:30:16.600
One for you, and another for you.

02:30:16.600 --> 02:30:17.463
Let's be honest.

02:30:19.510 --> 02:30:22.211
So click on over to the Critical Role shop.

02:30:22.211 --> 02:30:24.647
Don't worry, there's a few more minutes in the break.

02:30:24.647 --> 02:30:26.480
You've still got time.

02:30:31.823 --> 02:30:36.350
(grunting) Huh. Well, would you look at that?

02:30:36.350 --> 02:30:37.740
I think it worked.

02:30:37.740 --> 02:30:39.790
You were right, Pumat Number Three.

02:30:39.790 --> 02:30:42.690
All we had to do was invoke that subscription cantrip.

02:30:44.300 --> 02:30:45.250
Pumat Number Three?

02:30:48.210 --> 02:30:49.043
Oh boy.

02:30:49.043 --> 02:30:50.590
Ah, well hello there!

02:30:50.590 --> 02:30:52.030
I'm Pumat Prime.

02:30:52.030 --> 02:30:55.737
It's good to finally join you here in the prime dimension.

02:30:55.737 --> 02:31:00.737
I see this is the Twitch Prime realm, I think, and,

02:31:01.210 --> 02:31:04.450
oh, we're on the Critical Role channel, aren't we?

02:31:04.450 --> 02:31:08.330
Well, would you look at that, you got chat and everything.

02:31:08.330 --> 02:31:12.000
Respectfully, I was looking for the prime rib realm,

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.680
but this isn't too bad.

02:31:14.680 --> 02:31:16.900
You see, if you already have access

02:31:16.900 --> 02:31:18.870
to the Amazon Prime realm, you can get

02:31:18.870 --> 02:31:21.240
a free subscription to the channel of your choice

02:31:21.240 --> 02:31:22.830
in the Twitch Prime realm.

02:31:22.830 --> 02:31:25.660
The two realms have a pretty good working relationship

02:31:25.660 --> 02:31:28.160
after that peace treaty the Prime Minister signed

02:31:28.160 --> 02:31:29.740
a few years back.

02:31:29.740 --> 02:31:31.320
You just have to remember

02:31:31.320 --> 02:31:33.090
to renew your Twitch Prime subscription

02:31:33.090 --> 02:31:35.530
at the top of each month, respectfully.

02:31:35.530 --> 02:31:38.570
And hey, if you're already a subscriber,

02:31:38.570 --> 02:31:41.120
you can spread the joy by gifting a subscription

02:31:41.120 --> 02:31:43.850
using the Gift a Sub button.

02:31:43.850 --> 02:31:46.260
That is, assuming the empire hasn't sent

02:31:46.260 --> 02:31:48.210
the tax man to your shop here recently.

02:31:50.960 --> 02:31:52.300
All right, well, off to find

02:31:52.300 --> 02:31:54.660
that darn elusive prime rib realm.

02:31:54.660 --> 02:31:57.153
Who knew the prime dimension had so many pockets?

02:31:58.340 --> 02:31:59.173
Good luck.

02:32:02.284 --> 02:32:03.284
Pumat Three?

02:32:06.370 --> 02:32:07.520
Subscribe.

02:32:10.228 --> 02:32:11.228
Resubscribe.

02:32:13.290 --> 02:32:16.373
Brian Foster is not a cabbage.

02:44:59.534 --> 02:45:00.794
MATT: And welcome back.

02:45:00.794 --> 02:45:03.794
So, as you all stand there,

02:45:03.794 --> 02:45:05.624
spread about the snow,

02:45:05.624 --> 02:45:08.804
spattered with blood and rock,

02:45:08.804 --> 02:45:10.484
you can see the distant shape

02:45:10.484 --> 02:45:12.231
of Gelidon, the Nightmare in Ivory,

02:45:12.231 --> 02:45:13.844
(wings flapping)

02:45:13.844 --> 02:45:15.501
vanishing into the horizon

02:45:15.501 --> 02:45:17.384
of the gray and blue sky.

02:45:17.384 --> 02:45:20.284
Beauregard, you slowly pull yourself up

02:45:20.284 --> 02:45:21.524
from the soft snow,

02:45:21.524 --> 02:45:23.484
still not as hurt as you were earlier,

02:45:23.484 --> 02:45:24.524
but still just reeling

02:45:24.524 --> 02:45:27.874
from the final throes of that dragon battle.

02:45:27.874 --> 02:45:29.314
The rest of you take stock

02:45:29.314 --> 02:45:32.694
of the immediate end of the conflict,

02:45:32.694 --> 02:45:34.324
look around.

02:45:34.324 --> 02:45:35.157
What do you do?

02:45:35.157 --> 02:45:36.674
LIAM: Giant cat hand goes (whoosh)

02:45:38.434 --> 02:45:40.044
wiping snow off of your butt.

02:45:40.044 --> 02:45:41.821
MARISHA: Thank you, thank you.

02:45:41.821 --> 02:45:43.155
SAM: Just your butt.
LAURA: Just the butt.

02:45:43.155 --> 02:45:45.614
LIAM: All of it, all of it.
TALIESIN: Okay, that was pretty scary.

02:45:45.614 --> 02:45:46.830
Off of the Beau.

02:45:48.457 --> 02:45:51.015
SAM: Yasha, do you need help finding your little swordy?

02:45:51.015 --> 02:45:54.199
ASHLEY: (sighs) If you wouldn't mind.

02:45:54.199 --> 02:45:55.154
TALIESIN: I can help.

02:45:55.154 --> 02:45:56.989
Hold on. Detect Magic.

02:45:56.989 --> 02:45:58.865
ASHLEY: No, it's Skingorger.

02:45:58.865 --> 02:46:00.094
LAURA: Is it not magical?
TALIESIN: Still magical.

02:46:00.094 --> 02:46:02.277
ASHLEY: Skingorger is--
MATT: Skingorger's magical, yeah.

02:46:02.277 --> 02:46:04.464
TALIESIN: Yeah, they're all magical.
TALIESIN: Thank you.

02:46:04.464 --> 02:46:05.363
MATT: Okay.

02:46:05.363 --> 02:46:08.014
It doesn't take long.

02:46:08.014 --> 02:46:09.334
It is buried in the snow.

02:46:09.334 --> 02:46:11.127
The way it impacted and landed would've been

02:46:11.127 --> 02:46:12.134
very difficult to find.
TALIESIN: Ow.

02:46:12.134 --> 02:46:13.134
MATT: But you do manage to go ahead

02:46:13.134 --> 02:46:15.714
and metal-detect it out of the powder.

02:46:15.714 --> 02:46:17.724
ASHLEY: I definitely would not have found this without you,

02:46:17.724 --> 02:46:18.721
so thank you.

02:46:19.734 --> 02:46:21.814
TALIESIN: I needed to take my mind off

02:46:21.814 --> 02:46:23.324
things for a minute, if that's okay.

02:46:23.324 --> 02:46:24.354
The walk was nice.

02:46:27.064 --> 02:46:29.434
LIAM: We want to take a breather

02:46:29.434 --> 02:46:31.484
here for a little bit?

02:46:31.484 --> 02:46:33.334
TALIESIN: That'd be--
LIAM: No small task.

02:46:33.334 --> 02:46:34.167
TRAVIS: I think so.

02:46:34.167 --> 02:46:36.614
I think it's important to ask a question, though.

02:46:36.614 --> 02:46:39.104
"Just let her have her"?

02:46:39.104 --> 02:46:41.638
You were just going to let
the dragon go off with our friend?

02:46:41.638 --> 02:46:44.452
Is that the arrangement that we have?

02:46:44.452 --> 02:46:45.984
MATT: "Our arrangement didn't necessarily

02:46:45.984 --> 02:46:47.697
"involve having to save someone."

02:46:49.014 --> 02:46:50.554
TRAVIS: My goodness.

02:46:50.554 --> 02:46:51.674
I seem to have been operating

02:46:51.674 --> 02:46:54.094
under the wrong impression. (chuckles)

02:46:54.094 --> 02:46:55.524
Fair enough.

02:46:55.524 --> 02:46:56.857
MATT: "Don't act like you aren't working

02:46:56.857 --> 02:46:59.415
"towards our demise every night."

02:46:59.415 --> 02:47:02.599
LAURA: What? What are you talking about?

02:47:02.599 --> 02:47:04.424
TALIESIN: I mean.
MATT: (wheezes)

02:47:04.424 --> 02:47:08.117
"Look, we can play, and dance,

02:47:08.117 --> 02:47:11.944
"and continue this masquerade as long as we want,

02:47:11.944 --> 02:47:14.164
"but we've all got things to hide.

02:47:14.164 --> 02:47:15.594
"I'm just being honest.

02:47:15.594 --> 02:47:16.657
"No offense.

02:47:18.084 --> 02:47:19.228
"I have no reason to like you,

02:47:19.228 --> 02:47:20.911
"you've no reason to like me, either."

02:47:21.949 --> 02:47:23.404
MARISHA: Yeah, that's fair.
MATT: "Right, so?"

02:47:23.404 --> 02:47:24.604
LIAM: Yes.
MATT: "If it meant

02:47:24.604 --> 02:47:27.334
"our survival or yours,

02:47:27.334 --> 02:47:29.014
"I'm just going to make

02:47:29.014 --> 02:47:30.294
"a decision in the moment.

02:47:30.294 --> 02:47:31.694
"I hope you can respect that.

02:47:32.924 --> 02:47:34.424
"Would you've done the same for me?
MARISHA: I can.

02:47:37.092 --> 02:47:40.082
I guess it would've depended on the circumstance.

02:47:40.082 --> 02:47:41.504
LIAM: It's a little more complicated

02:47:41.504 --> 02:47:42.844
for us on our end, but--

02:47:42.844 --> 02:47:43.677
MARISHA: Exactly.

02:47:43.677 --> 02:47:45.394
LIAM: You're right, at least on surface level,

02:47:45.394 --> 02:47:46.427
we are not friends.

02:47:48.437 --> 02:47:50.364
MATT: "But we survived

02:47:50.364 --> 02:47:52.445
"a fucking white dragon.

02:47:52.445 --> 02:47:54.574
"Want ask you about that sometime.

02:47:54.574 --> 02:47:56.054
"It's not often they

02:47:56.054 --> 02:47:57.317
"seem to be familiar."

02:47:59.298 --> 02:48:01.384
LAURA: We make friends everywhere we go.

02:48:01.384 --> 02:48:03.004
MATT: "I can tell. You are just

02:48:03.004 --> 02:48:05.637
"a bunch of brightened stars in the sky."

02:48:08.024 --> 02:48:09.084
TRAVIS: Do we need to take a moment

02:48:09.084 --> 02:48:11.723
to collect ourselves before we (laughs)--

02:48:11.723 --> 02:48:14.144
LIAM: I would love to.
TRAVIS: -- start our day?

02:48:14.144 --> 02:48:15.744
LIAM: I would love to.

02:48:15.744 --> 02:48:16.974
TRAVIS: Well, we have been going for four hours,

02:48:16.974 --> 02:48:18.450
so it's all right.

02:48:18.450 --> 02:48:21.152
MATT: "You're a late riser."
LIAM: (sighs)

02:48:22.624 --> 02:48:23.504
MATT: "So we're taking a moment?"

02:48:23.504 --> 02:48:25.065
SAM: Yeah, I guess so.
LIAM: Yes, yes, please.

02:48:25.065 --> 02:48:26.864
MATT: "All right."

02:48:26.864 --> 02:48:28.984
So you guys take a short rest.

02:48:28.984 --> 02:48:30.734
MARISHA: Sure.
TRAVIS: I'll go over to Jester,

02:48:30.734 --> 02:48:32.897
and I'll give her a kiss.

02:48:32.897 --> 02:48:33.744
SAM: Oh!

02:48:33.744 --> 02:48:35.376
TRAVIS: Hey, thank you.

02:48:35.376 --> 02:48:36.209
SAM: Oh!

02:48:36.209 --> 02:48:39.182
LAURA: Oh well, you know, anything

02:48:40.462 --> 02:48:42.279
for my Fjord.

02:48:44.161 --> 02:48:46.085
TRAVIS: What? I'm mad for her.

02:48:47.034 --> 02:48:47.884
SAM: Where did that--?

02:48:49.203 --> 02:48:53.134
I-- re-- what--?

02:48:53.134 --> 02:48:54.649
TRAVIS: I just leave Veth stuck

02:48:54.649 --> 02:48:56.764
stammering in the snow.

02:48:56.764 --> 02:48:57.814
SAM: That's a thing now?

02:49:00.094 --> 02:49:00.927
Did you--?

02:49:02.447 --> 02:49:03.280
Have you--?

02:49:04.554 --> 02:49:06.542
Have you kissed him often?

02:49:09.014 --> 02:49:09.964
LAURA: No.

02:49:10.813 --> 02:49:13.148
That was the first time he ever kissed me.

02:49:13.148 --> 02:49:13.981
SAM: Just now?

02:49:13.981 --> 02:49:15.747
LAURA: Just then, you witnessed it.

02:49:15.747 --> 02:49:18.440
SAM: That was such a anticlimactic--

02:49:18.440 --> 02:49:19.923
LAURA: Apparently he's mad for me.

02:49:20.994 --> 02:49:22.444
SAM: And just said it like that?

02:49:22.444 --> 02:49:24.262
LAURA: Guess so, weird.
SAM: Matter-of-factly?

02:49:24.262 --> 02:49:26.274
LAURA: I know.

02:49:26.274 --> 02:49:28.039
SAM: Are you still mad for him?

02:49:32.204 --> 02:49:33.270
That's amazing.

02:49:33.270 --> 02:49:35.126
LAURA: Yeah, it's pretty great.

02:49:35.126 --> 02:49:38.199
SAM: Wow. Are you steadies?

02:49:38.199 --> 02:49:39.882
LAURA: I don't know!

02:49:39.882 --> 02:49:41.654
SAM: Well, you have to define it.

02:49:41.654 --> 02:49:43.413
LAURA: Why?
SAM: You have to be upfront

02:49:43.413 --> 02:49:45.834
with your feelings and with your status,

02:49:45.834 --> 02:49:47.632
or else someone else might come in,

02:49:47.632 --> 02:49:49.167
and try to sweep him off his feet.

02:49:49.167 --> 02:49:50.084
LAURA: Like you?

02:49:50.970 --> 02:49:53.791
SAM: I could if I wanted to.

02:49:53.791 --> 02:49:54.648
MARISHA: (laughs)

02:49:54.648 --> 02:49:56.490
LAURA: I have no doubt about that, Veth.

02:49:56.490 --> 02:49:59.614
(laughter)

02:49:59.614 --> 02:50:01.474
SAM: But I'm a married woman.

02:50:01.474 --> 02:50:04.004
And his--
TRAVIS: First gear, second gear, third gear.

02:50:04.004 --> 02:50:05.587
SAM: -- very lanky.

02:50:08.614 --> 02:50:10.804
That's amazing, exciting for you.

02:50:10.804 --> 02:50:11.984
LAURA: Yeah.

02:50:11.984 --> 02:50:13.537
SAM: Everyone's finding love.

02:50:16.933 --> 02:50:17.766
LAURA: Yeah.

02:50:21.334 --> 02:50:23.842
SAM: I'd like to think that it was my advice that did it.

02:50:24.954 --> 02:50:27.298
LAURA: It's all you.
SAM: Thank you.

02:50:27.298 --> 02:50:30.032
TRAVIS: How is Otis looking in all this?

02:50:31.264 --> 02:50:32.097
MATT: Hmm?

02:50:32.097 --> 02:50:32.938
TRAVIS: Otis.

02:50:32.938 --> 02:50:35.630
MATT: He's actually sitting maybe 10 feet from Lucien,

02:50:35.630 --> 02:50:37.204
just on the ground,

02:50:37.204 --> 02:50:39.204
looks like he's chewing on a piece of--

02:50:39.204 --> 02:50:41.697
could be tree bark, could be old jerky.

02:50:42.594 --> 02:50:44.403
It's hard to say. I mean, most of them are still clustered.

02:50:44.403 --> 02:50:45.828
They, much like you guys,

02:50:45.828 --> 02:50:47.420
keep to your own, they keep to their own.

02:50:48.344 --> 02:50:50.024
TRAVIS: Not going to lie.

02:50:50.024 --> 02:50:52.154
The first time we fought

02:50:52.154 --> 02:50:53.614
an ancient white dragon,

02:50:53.614 --> 02:50:55.484
pretty big for us.

02:50:55.484 --> 02:50:56.317
How about you?

02:50:57.484 --> 02:50:58.404
MATT: (as Lucien) "That was the first time

02:50:58.404 --> 02:51:01.369
"we've fought an ancient white dragon, correct?"

02:51:01.369 --> 02:51:03.001
The rest of them look at each other,

02:51:03.001 --> 02:51:04.569
(as Otis) "Yeah, I've never, never really

02:51:04.569 --> 02:51:06.508
"seen one up close or afar.

02:51:06.508 --> 02:51:08.474
"Never seen one, never seen one."

02:51:08.474 --> 02:51:11.879
TRAVIS: Yep, handled it well, handled it well.

02:51:11.879 --> 02:51:13.317
MATT: Zoran's just like,

02:51:14.841 --> 02:51:16.074
"Didn't keep flying off,

02:51:16.074 --> 02:51:17.261
"I would have fucking taken

02:51:17.261 --> 02:51:18.971
"his head off, I would."

02:51:20.049 --> 02:51:21.511
Puts his maul on the ground. (thumping)

02:51:21.511 --> 02:51:24.219
And it was still flaming, it like (sizzling)

02:51:24.219 --> 02:51:25.604
out in the snow.

02:51:25.604 --> 02:51:26.474
TRAVIS: It's very impressive.

02:51:26.474 --> 02:51:29.144
I can tell you, our friend, Yasha,

02:51:29.144 --> 02:51:30.274
was experiencing the same

02:51:30.274 --> 02:51:31.354
sort of frustration.

02:51:31.354 --> 02:51:34.607
Next time, we'll herd it towards you.

02:51:38.584 --> 02:51:40.072
ASHLEY: It's frustrating.

02:51:40.072 --> 02:51:41.538
MATT: (as Zoran) "Yeah."
ASHLEY: You get this close.

02:51:41.538 --> 02:51:42.579
MATT: "Yeah."

02:51:43.704 --> 02:51:45.117
Lucien, at this point, goes,

02:51:46.041 --> 02:51:49.079
"See this? This is why

02:51:49.079 --> 02:51:51.341
"it was good we worked together."

02:51:51.341 --> 02:51:52.941
"I mean, if we'd gone on our own--

02:51:53.894 --> 02:51:54.827
"Actually, we would have

02:51:54.827 --> 02:51:56.519
"probably not had a problem with the dragon,

02:51:56.519 --> 02:51:58.339
"but if you'd gone on your own,

02:51:58.339 --> 02:52:00.357
"that could have ended very differently.

02:52:01.771 --> 02:52:02.621
"Well done."

02:52:05.324 --> 02:52:06.646
LAURA: Thanks for not attacking us

02:52:06.646 --> 02:52:08.967
while she was also doing it.

02:52:09.897 --> 02:52:12.377
MATT: "You know, thank you for the same."

02:52:13.384 --> 02:52:14.217
LAURA: Yep.

02:52:15.294 --> 02:52:18.894
MATT: "So, when you're rested and ready,

02:52:18.894 --> 02:52:20.584
"shall we see if we can

02:52:20.584 --> 02:52:21.694
"finish out the day and--"

02:52:21.694 --> 02:52:22.527
SAM: Yes.

02:52:23.754 --> 02:52:26.664
MATT: "Certainly. Follow suit.

02:52:26.664 --> 02:52:28.207
"Keep your eyes peeled."

02:52:29.514 --> 02:52:30.554
And he continues walking

02:52:30.554 --> 02:52:31.914
and the rest of them follow suit,

02:52:31.914 --> 02:52:34.144
and continuing in the direction you were.

02:52:34.144 --> 02:52:35.134
TRAVIS: As we start moving,

02:52:35.134 --> 02:52:38.294
I'll walk up over next to Caleb,

02:52:38.294 --> 02:52:39.954
and as quietly as I can,

02:52:39.954 --> 02:52:41.364
but knowing that we're probably

02:52:41.364 --> 02:52:43.804
being listened to at any moment,

02:52:43.804 --> 02:52:46.031
just sort of side mouth say,

02:52:46.031 --> 02:52:49.851
"Any complications during that encounter?"

02:52:52.134 --> 02:52:54.180
LIAM: You mean new wrinkles?

02:52:54.180 --> 02:52:55.080
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

02:52:56.234 --> 02:52:59.847
LIAM: Nothing that I can ascertain as of yet.

02:53:03.375 --> 02:53:05.050
A lot on our plates as it is.

02:53:06.576 --> 02:53:07.751
TRAVIS: Very true.

02:53:10.209 --> 02:53:12.667
LIAM: All right, one foot in front of the other.

02:53:15.167 --> 02:53:16.100
MATT: Okay.

02:53:19.726 --> 02:53:23.510
Caduceus and, I'd say--

02:53:25.294 --> 02:53:28.414
yeah, just Caduceus. You glance.

02:53:28.414 --> 02:53:29.334
As everyone's getting to leave,

02:53:29.334 --> 02:53:30.194
you're holding up the back,

02:53:30.194 --> 02:53:31.684
and you glance behind you,

02:53:31.684 --> 02:53:34.784
see the faint shape of something

02:53:34.784 --> 02:53:36.534
moving through the snow behind you.

02:53:37.554 --> 02:53:39.181
Make a perception check.

02:53:39.181 --> 02:53:41.433
MARISHA: Is it Dagen?

02:53:41.433 --> 02:53:44.757
Oh boy, yeah.
TRAVIS: (laughs)

02:53:45.976 --> 02:53:49.294
TALIESIN: God, my eyesight's going. 22.

02:53:49.294 --> 02:53:51.064
MATT: 22, hard to make out the shape.

02:53:51.064 --> 02:53:52.624
It's low enough and consistent enough,

02:53:52.624 --> 02:53:54.034
and based on previous discussion,

02:53:54.034 --> 02:53:55.534
you gather it's probably Dagen

02:53:56.414 --> 02:53:57.424
trailing you guys,

02:53:57.424 --> 02:53:59.224
and trying to keep up best he can.

02:53:59.224 --> 02:54:00.240
TRAVIS: He's just going--

02:54:01.123 --> 02:54:02.254
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

02:54:02.254 --> 02:54:04.124
MATT: Yeah, you can imagine what he just witnessed.

02:54:04.124 --> 02:54:06.259
TRAVIS: Do I really want to get paid?

02:54:07.554 --> 02:54:08.397
TALIESIN: We, uh...

02:54:10.874 --> 02:54:12.564
We should have a conversation

02:54:14.494 --> 02:54:19.260
tonight about how things are going to go.

02:54:22.914 --> 02:54:25.052
Nothing scary or nothing,

02:54:25.052 --> 02:54:27.047
but I don't know.

02:54:28.374 --> 02:54:30.524
How are we going to prepare for what's coming?

02:54:36.544 --> 02:54:37.454
MARISHA: Feels less like something

02:54:37.454 --> 02:54:40.044
you prepare for and more like something

02:54:42.204 --> 02:54:46.729
you have caveats for,

02:54:46.729 --> 02:54:48.362
rip-cords.

02:54:50.664 --> 02:54:52.137
TRAVIS: What would those be?

02:54:53.684 --> 02:54:57.010
MARISHA: If Caleb and I turn on you, you kill us.

02:54:57.010 --> 02:54:59.382
TRAVIS: Oh, those kind of ripcords.

02:54:59.382 --> 02:55:01.157
LAURA: I have an idea.

02:55:02.164 --> 02:55:03.614
I don't know if it will work,

02:55:04.614 --> 02:55:09.064
but I feel like whatever it is

02:55:09.064 --> 02:55:12.274
that's put a mark on you,

02:55:12.274 --> 02:55:15.464
is pretty evil, right?

02:55:15.464 --> 02:55:16.687
It doesn't feel good.

02:55:19.514 --> 02:55:21.464
LIAM: Doesn't feel like anything as of yet.

02:55:25.124 --> 02:55:27.474
LAURA: I'm going to

02:55:31.816 --> 02:55:35.854
walk up next to Caleb and put my hand on his shoulder,

02:55:35.854 --> 02:55:36.777
where it is.

02:55:38.814 --> 02:55:41.017
Do you want me to try this or do you want--?

02:55:41.017 --> 02:55:42.643
LIAM: Yeah, I trust you.

02:55:43.927 --> 02:55:44.974
LAURA: And I'm going to try to cast

02:55:44.974 --> 02:55:47.357
Dispel Evil and Good.

02:55:48.824 --> 02:55:49.657
MATT: Okay.

02:56:00.704 --> 02:56:02.374
LAURA: "Protects you from creatures

02:56:02.374 --> 02:56:04.574
"beyond the material plane."

02:56:04.574 --> 02:56:06.374
And there's one called Dismissal,

02:56:06.374 --> 02:56:08.534
which can send a creature

02:56:08.534 --> 02:56:10.094
that has come from another plane away.

02:56:10.094 --> 02:56:12.178
MATT: Correct, yeah, I see it.
LAURA: So I'm wondering if it can

02:56:12.178 --> 02:56:13.417
do something like that.

02:56:14.924 --> 02:56:15.994
MATT: As you reach out,

02:56:15.994 --> 02:56:18.754
and you can see

02:56:18.754 --> 02:56:21.594
the faint divine glow around

02:56:21.594 --> 02:56:23.064
your Traveler's holy symbol

02:56:23.064 --> 02:56:25.204
begin to swell within your

02:56:25.204 --> 02:56:26.344
torso and shoulders,

02:56:26.344 --> 02:56:27.664
and then shoot to the hand

02:56:27.664 --> 02:56:29.854
onto his shoulder. You watch as Caleb,

02:56:29.854 --> 02:56:32.062
the right side of his arm just (vibration)

02:56:32.062 --> 02:56:33.194
pulses in this wave,

02:56:33.194 --> 02:56:35.127
this almost drifting foam bubble

02:56:35.127 --> 02:56:37.717
that (poof) disperses.

02:56:39.918 --> 02:56:42.112
LAURA: Did it feel like anything?

02:56:42.112 --> 02:56:44.044
LIAM: Did it feel like anything?

02:56:44.044 --> 02:56:46.079
MATT: Didn't feel like anything, necessarily.

02:56:47.605 --> 02:56:49.024
LIAM: It's pretty cold out here,

02:56:49.024 --> 02:56:51.144
but that's fine.

02:56:51.144 --> 02:56:52.764
And I just start--

02:56:52.764 --> 02:56:54.089
TALIESIN: Find out--
MARISHA: What they want.

02:56:54.089 --> 02:56:55.934
TALIESIN: Maybe we'll find out later.

02:56:55.934 --> 02:56:58.707
MARISHA: Yeah, are they watching?
TALIESIN: Let's get warm.

02:56:58.707 --> 02:57:00.974
MATT: They're not at the moment paying attention.

02:57:00.974 --> 02:57:02.374
They're all looking forward.

02:57:02.374 --> 02:57:03.544
MARISHA: Okay.

02:57:03.544 --> 02:57:04.727
LIAM: So itchy.

02:57:07.484 --> 02:57:08.848
MATT: It's still there.

02:57:08.848 --> 02:57:11.374
TRAVIS: (laughs)
MARISHA: (sighs)

02:57:11.374 --> 02:57:13.257
MATT: It's a good call, but unfortunately,

02:57:14.104 --> 02:57:14.984
little bit outside the realm

02:57:14.984 --> 02:57:17.224
of what that spell can affect.

02:57:17.224 --> 02:57:20.149
TALIESIN: Maybe we use--
MATT: Worth a shot.

02:57:20.149 --> 02:57:21.182
LAURA: It was a high level.

02:57:21.182 --> 02:57:24.274
Thought that it had a good chance. Guess not.

02:57:24.274 --> 02:57:25.107
LIAM: Don't kick yourself.

02:57:25.107 --> 02:57:27.414
TALIESIN: Instead of being tailed,

02:57:27.414 --> 02:57:32.384
maybe we should send somebody ahead.

02:57:32.384 --> 02:57:33.584
MARISHA: How do you mean?

02:57:33.584 --> 02:57:37.047
TALIESIN: Well, we don't want to say it out loud.

02:57:39.044 --> 02:57:40.394
If we had somebody we could

02:57:42.374 --> 02:57:44.894
send ahead to civilization to try

02:57:44.894 --> 02:57:45.944
and get the word out?

02:57:47.056 --> 02:57:50.174
If only one of us could get away

02:57:50.174 --> 02:57:51.024
for a little bit.

02:57:53.793 --> 02:57:56.368
TRAVIS: You mean in the open while we're walking?

02:57:56.368 --> 02:57:57.394
TALIESIN: Yeah, like somebody

02:57:57.394 --> 02:58:00.874
who really understood the terrain

02:58:00.874 --> 02:58:02.154
and knew how to move through it

02:58:02.154 --> 02:58:03.842
really quickly and...

02:58:03.842 --> 02:58:06.126
TRAVIS: Oh.
LAURA: Oh.

02:58:06.126 --> 02:58:07.855
TALIESIN: I'm not good at this, I don't know.

02:58:07.855 --> 02:58:08.688
SAM: No, no, we get it.

02:58:08.688 --> 02:58:09.569
TALIESIN: Oh, okay.
SAM: We get it, we get it.

02:58:09.569 --> 02:58:10.402
We got it, we got it.
TALIESIN: Really felt like

02:58:10.402 --> 02:58:12.302
I was missing the mark there.

02:58:12.302 --> 02:58:14.644
LAURA: Like I could (barely audible) polymorph them?

02:58:14.644 --> 02:58:15.904
TRAVIS: No, nope, nope.

02:58:15.904 --> 02:58:19.004
Like you could send word to him

02:58:20.664 --> 02:58:22.726
and say, "Go on ahead!"

02:58:24.143 --> 02:58:25.754
SAM: Where would we want--
LAURA: Send a message?

02:58:25.754 --> 02:58:30.754
SAM: Where would we want to see ahead of us?

02:58:31.076 --> 02:58:34.486
TALIESIN: Civilization, somewhere to maybe rally people.

02:58:35.334 --> 02:58:36.336
SAM: Civilization?
ASHLEY: Are you talking about--

02:58:36.336 --> 02:58:37.169
SAM: Is there civilization?

02:58:37.169 --> 02:58:38.494
ASHLEY: -- Dagen?
MARISHA: In Aeor?

02:58:38.494 --> 02:58:40.495
Is that what you're talking about?
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah.

02:58:40.495 --> 02:58:43.624
LAURA: The only thing that would be around there is Essek.

02:58:43.624 --> 02:58:44.546
TRAVIS: Yeah, there's nothing on the map

02:58:44.546 --> 02:58:46.837
between A2 and Aeor and

02:58:46.837 --> 02:58:48.189
their little entrances.
TALIESIN: Essek might-- maybe just seeing

02:58:48.189 --> 02:58:50.617
a person whose seen what we've seen

02:58:50.617 --> 02:58:53.127
might be enough to get them moving.

02:58:54.214 --> 02:58:56.227
LAURA: So send him to Essek?

02:58:56.227 --> 02:58:58.644
TALIESIN: I don't know. It might get Essek to move.

02:58:58.644 --> 02:59:01.634
LAURA: I feel like the only option there

02:59:01.634 --> 02:59:04.494
to get him fast is to polymorph him

02:59:04.494 --> 02:59:05.947
and try to send him ahead.

02:59:07.234 --> 02:59:08.874
I can't teleport him.

02:59:08.874 --> 02:59:10.792
TALIESIN: You can-- he can move fine.

02:59:11.864 --> 02:59:13.734
He's fast, the only reason I think he's going slow

02:59:13.734 --> 02:59:14.784
is 'cause we're slow.

02:59:18.394 --> 02:59:20.194
LAURA: I could polymorph him and he could get ahead.

02:59:20.194 --> 02:59:22.110
TALIESIN: You really want to polymorph him really bad.

02:59:22.110 --> 02:59:23.624
LAURA: Well, you know.
MATT: (laughs)

02:59:23.624 --> 02:59:25.474
TRAVIS: That might be a little obvi though.

02:59:25.474 --> 02:59:27.454
TALIESIN: Yeah, need to keep this quiet.

02:59:27.454 --> 02:59:29.734
TRAVIS: And I think he works exclusively

02:59:29.734 --> 02:59:33.902
for the Empire, right? No?

02:59:33.902 --> 02:59:35.604
LAURA: Who?

02:59:35.604 --> 02:59:37.984
TALIESIN: No, I don't think so.
LAURA: No.

02:59:37.984 --> 02:59:38.817
TRAVIS: For both--

02:59:38.817 --> 02:59:40.342
TALIESIN: Yeah.
TRAVIS: -- the Dynasty and the Empire?

02:59:40.342 --> 02:59:42.764
LAURA: Yeah, he's--
TALIESIN: Hardly matters right now,

02:59:42.764 --> 02:59:44.994
but yeah, I think both.

02:59:44.994 --> 02:59:49.174
TRAVIS: Just don't want to send
an Empire guy to a Dynasty outpost.

02:59:49.174 --> 02:59:50.224
It'll be like, "Bye."

02:59:51.904 --> 02:59:53.297
TALIESIN: We can send word ahead.

02:59:55.016 --> 02:59:56.099
TRAVIS: Just thinking out loud.

02:59:56.099 --> 02:59:57.334
TALIESIN: Keeping an eye on everything,

02:59:57.334 --> 02:59:59.084
making sure it doesn't look like--

03:00:00.259 --> 03:00:01.404
I'm trying to keep an eye out.

03:00:01.404 --> 03:00:02.627
I know that's impossible.

03:00:02.627 --> 03:00:04.917
MATT: I understand, okay.

03:00:06.154 --> 03:00:08.071
Do you guys continue on for the remainder of the day?

03:00:09.714 --> 03:00:10.644
LAURA: I can do it.

03:00:10.644 --> 03:00:12.804
MATT: All right.
LIAM: On a path with the inevitable.

03:00:12.804 --> 03:00:15.114
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: It's not a bad idea.

03:00:15.114 --> 03:00:17.874
MATT: Pushing forward, you continue on for the rest

03:00:17.874 --> 03:00:20.017
of your jaunt eastward.

03:00:21.644 --> 03:00:23.484
Eventually, the light of day

03:00:23.484 --> 03:00:24.547
begins to fade.

03:00:25.409 --> 03:00:27.708
LAURA: Can I, before we did all that?

03:00:27.708 --> 03:00:29.383
MATT: Yeah. That's what I was asking about.

03:00:29.383 --> 03:00:30.266
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:00:30.266 --> 03:00:33.800
Can I at least send a message back to Dagen?

03:00:33.800 --> 03:00:35.334
MATT: Sure.

03:00:35.334 --> 03:00:37.197
SAM: Do you have to make noise to send a message

03:00:37.197 --> 03:00:38.787
or is it telepathic?

03:00:41.564 --> 03:00:43.644
MATT: It says it's verbal components, right?

03:00:43.644 --> 03:00:45.534
LAURA: Yeah, I feel like...

03:00:45.534 --> 03:00:46.764
MATT: Don't think it's--

03:00:46.764 --> 03:00:47.994
LAURA: It's verbal.
MATT: I think it's spoken,

03:00:47.994 --> 03:00:49.536
it's verbal, it's part of the spell.

03:00:49.536 --> 03:00:52.864
SAM: Oh, okay.

03:00:52.864 --> 03:00:53.697
TALIESIN: We can...

03:00:55.044 --> 03:00:56.287
SAM: Bathroom break?

03:00:57.641 --> 03:00:58.609
LAURA: What? (giggles)

03:00:58.609 --> 03:00:59.698
SAM: Do you want to go?

03:00:59.698 --> 03:01:01.244
TRAVIS: You've been saying how much you need to--

03:01:01.244 --> 03:01:02.534
SAM: Go over there and pee,

03:01:02.534 --> 03:01:05.867
and then, away from us.
LAURA: Sure, I'll go pee.

03:01:05.867 --> 03:01:07.444
Okay, bye.
TALIESIN: We can just clump, but okay.

03:01:07.444 --> 03:01:09.684
TRAVIS: In the flat snowy tundra.

03:01:09.684 --> 03:01:11.504
LAURA: Okay, I'll go stand over here

03:01:11.504 --> 03:01:13.774
and sit down in the snow,

03:01:13.774 --> 03:01:15.207
so it looks like I'm peeing.

03:01:16.105 --> 03:01:18.754
LIAM: I cast Widogast's Web of Fire--

03:01:18.754 --> 03:01:21.294
Wall of Fire, not Widogast,

03:01:21.294 --> 03:01:22.127
just Wall of Fire,

03:01:22.127 --> 03:01:23.394
and make a curtain of fire,

03:01:23.394 --> 03:01:25.744
so that everyone doesn't have to watch Jester pee.

03:01:26.844 --> 03:01:27.677
MATT: Okay.

03:01:27.677 --> 03:01:29.732
LAURA: That's noticeable now, okay.

03:01:29.732 --> 03:01:31.282
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
LIAM: You're peeing, though.

03:01:31.282 --> 03:01:32.812
LAURA: Yeah, I'm totally peeing.

03:01:32.812 --> 03:01:34.359
MATT: The Tomb Takers do stop and turn,

03:01:34.359 --> 03:01:35.614
and there is like a brief reaction

03:01:35.614 --> 03:01:37.491
where from their perspective, forced perspective,

03:01:37.491 --> 03:01:39.480
it looks like you just incinerated one of your friends.

03:01:39.480 --> 03:01:40.695
(laughter)

03:01:40.695 --> 03:01:42.957
LIAM: Tinkle break, tinkle break.

03:01:42.957 --> 03:01:44.274
MATT: "It took a second, but I gathered."

03:01:44.274 --> 03:01:45.374
LIAM: Eyes forward, please.

03:01:47.414 --> 03:01:50.894
LAURA: I'll send a message to Dagen while I'm...

03:01:50.894 --> 03:01:53.194
I'm actually going to pee, just to make it look like

03:01:53.194 --> 03:01:54.557
I'm talking to myself while I'm peeing.

03:01:54.557 --> 03:01:55.390
MATT: You got it.

03:01:55.390 --> 03:01:57.327
LAURA: Just in case they're watching me.

03:01:57.327 --> 03:01:58.327
MATT: We have a history in D&amp;D

03:01:58.327 --> 03:02:00.506
of having characters talking to things
while they're using the bathroom,

03:02:00.506 --> 03:02:01.645
so it works out great.

03:02:01.645 --> 03:02:03.562
TRAVIS: Best conversations.

03:02:05.064 --> 03:02:06.524
LAURA: Because you travel a lot faster,

03:02:06.524 --> 03:02:08.634
we're wondering if you could get

03:02:08.634 --> 03:02:13.154
to the east side of Aeor

03:02:14.624 --> 03:02:16.324
to give a message?

03:02:16.324 --> 03:02:19.394
Give word ahead. Fuck.

03:02:19.394 --> 03:02:21.644
(laughter)

03:02:27.014 --> 03:02:30.442
MATT: (as Dagen) "Could you pay me before?

03:02:32.044 --> 03:02:34.054
"No disrespect,

03:02:34.054 --> 03:02:36.407
"but that was a dragon."

03:02:38.764 --> 03:02:42.084
LAURA: Right, do I remember how much we still owe him?

03:02:42.084 --> 03:02:44.704
MATT: You still owe him 2,000 gold

03:02:44.704 --> 03:02:46.514
upon arrival at Aeor.

03:02:47.774 --> 03:02:51.014
TALIESIN: Shit.
LAURA: 2,000 gold, right.

03:02:51.014 --> 03:02:53.347
MATT: He's become the $2 kid from "Better Off Dead".

03:02:54.744 --> 03:02:56.194
LAURA: Right, right, right, right.

03:02:57.304 --> 03:02:58.884
MATT: Much friendlier than him, but.

03:02:58.884 --> 03:03:00.934
LAURA: Okay, I'll finish peeing

03:03:00.934 --> 03:03:02.934
and catch up with the rest of the group.

03:03:04.367 --> 03:03:06.154
I don't have that much.

03:03:06.154 --> 03:03:08.254
SAM: Everything come out okay?

03:03:08.254 --> 03:03:10.095
LAURA: Yep, peed real good.

03:03:10.095 --> 03:03:13.002
TALIESIN: It's 200 platinum, right?
LAURA: It was an expensive pee though.

03:03:13.002 --> 03:03:15.677
MARISHA: I've got a hundred platinum I can toss.

03:03:15.677 --> 03:03:17.164
I toss a hundred platinum.

03:03:17.164 --> 03:03:18.464
LAURA: You guys got it covered?

03:03:19.594 --> 03:03:21.414
MARISHA: Should we hide it,

03:03:21.414 --> 03:03:22.914
and he can pick it up?

03:03:22.914 --> 03:03:24.584
LAURA: Yeah. That's what I imagined,

03:03:24.584 --> 03:03:25.864
we just drop it on the path,

03:03:25.864 --> 03:03:30.224
but with a note also to say like...

03:03:30.224 --> 03:03:31.124
To give to Essek maybe.

03:03:31.124 --> 03:03:32.444
TALIESIN: This is going to be really hard to do

03:03:32.444 --> 03:03:34.647
without being noticed, let's just...

03:03:34.647 --> 03:03:35.622
LAURA: We just going to try it.

03:03:35.622 --> 03:03:36.805
They're ahead of us.

03:03:36.805 --> 03:03:38.164
LAURA: They're not--
SAM: -- our team.

03:03:38.164 --> 03:03:40.537
LAURA: They said they were off ahead of us.

03:03:40.537 --> 03:03:42.228
We're just trailing them in the path now.

03:03:42.228 --> 03:03:43.969
MATT: Yeah.
MARISHA: I sleight of hand that shit.

03:03:43.969 --> 03:03:46.050
LIAM: Just put that red windshield scraper right down

03:03:46.050 --> 03:03:46.883
in the snow.
LAURA: Plus, I'm constantly drawing

03:03:46.883 --> 03:03:47.716
in my sketchbook,

03:03:47.716 --> 03:03:50.416
it's not like that's completely out of the ordinary.

03:03:50.416 --> 03:03:51.832
TALIESIN: All right.
LAURA: So in my sketchbook,

03:03:51.832 --> 03:03:53.414
I'm going to write a note to Essek

03:03:53.414 --> 03:03:57.881
to let him know everything that's going on and you know,

03:03:59.144 --> 03:04:02.284
and just say why we need his help,

03:04:02.284 --> 03:04:04.816
and what we're afraid--

03:04:04.816 --> 03:04:06.874
I don't know what the fuck I'm writing.

03:04:06.874 --> 03:04:07.707
MATT: (laughs)

03:04:07.707 --> 03:04:09.094
SAM: You're afraid?

03:04:09.094 --> 03:04:09.927
LAURA: We don't know want them

03:04:09.927 --> 03:04:12.784
to bring back the whole city area,

03:04:12.784 --> 03:04:15.754
the Cognouzum, and there's a demony thing

03:04:15.754 --> 03:04:17.594
that's out in the Astral Sea, and--

03:04:17.594 --> 03:04:19.174
SAM: You're giving him all the downlow.

03:04:19.174 --> 03:04:20.007
LAURA: I'm just giving it.

03:04:20.007 --> 03:04:23.256
I'm just rambling in words.
MATT: Okay.

03:04:23.256 --> 03:04:25.594
LAURA: And then, I'm going to rip it off

03:04:25.594 --> 03:04:27.534
and put it in a little pouch.

03:04:27.534 --> 03:04:28.384
MATT: Okay.

03:04:28.384 --> 03:04:31.051
MARISHA: Tell him to message you when he gets it.

03:04:32.801 --> 03:04:35.134
Essek. (chuckles)

03:04:35.134 --> 03:04:36.426
LAURA: Message me when you get this.

03:04:36.426 --> 03:04:37.534
SAM: (laughs)

03:04:37.534 --> 03:04:39.027
Okay, here, give me the stuff,

03:04:39.027 --> 03:04:41.764
I'll just set it somewhere.

03:04:41.764 --> 03:04:45.274
LAURA: I'm doing this all with a-sleight of hand

03:04:45.274 --> 03:04:46.634
so I can try to be subtle

03:04:46.634 --> 03:04:48.604
about putting it in a little baggy.

03:04:48.604 --> 03:04:51.443
MATT: Then go ahead and roll
sleight of hand for me, if you don't mind.

03:04:51.443 --> 03:04:52.443
LAURA: Sure.

03:04:58.726 --> 03:04:59.559
18!

03:05:00.766 --> 03:05:03.100
MATT: 18, nice.

03:05:05.924 --> 03:05:06.924
You drop the bag.

03:05:08.734 --> 03:05:09.824
Oh wait, I'm dropping the bag?

03:05:09.824 --> 03:05:11.384
I thought I was giving the--

03:05:11.384 --> 03:05:13.124
Sure, I'll drop the bag. (chuckles)

03:05:13.124 --> 03:05:14.384
SAM: You have the money, everyone?

03:05:14.384 --> 03:05:16.042
LAURA: I assume everybody gave me the money as well.

03:05:16.042 --> 03:05:17.208
MATT: Yeah.
LAURA: Okay.

03:05:17.208 --> 03:05:21.324
MATT: Okay. So you placed the note inside the bag?

03:05:21.324 --> 03:05:22.157
Are you handing it off to--

03:05:22.157 --> 03:05:23.490
Is that just you putting the note in there?

03:05:25.134 --> 03:05:26.645
LAURA: That was just going to be me
putting the note in the bag.

03:05:26.645 --> 03:05:28.202
MATT: Okay, okay, now, I'm clarifying,

03:05:28.202 --> 03:05:29.814
I'm not trying to put actions in your--

03:05:29.814 --> 03:05:30.664
LAURA: Okay, I was just putting

03:05:30.664 --> 03:05:31.891
the note in the bag, and then, I--

03:05:31.891 --> 03:05:32.933
MATT: You feel pretty solid.

03:05:32.933 --> 03:05:34.614
LAURA: Okay, okay.
MATT: It's a common action

03:05:34.614 --> 03:05:35.754
to put things in bags.

03:05:35.754 --> 03:05:37.804
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: (laughs)

03:05:37.804 --> 03:05:39.114
LIAM: Roll for bags.

03:05:39.114 --> 03:05:40.717
LAURA: Okay, cool, cool, cool.

03:05:40.717 --> 03:05:43.334
SAM: I'll grab the bag.

03:05:43.334 --> 03:05:44.604
LAURA: Okay.

03:05:44.604 --> 03:05:47.054
SAM: And the money pouch,

03:05:47.054 --> 03:05:49.164
and sleight of handily...

03:05:49.164 --> 03:05:50.294
LAURA: And you're low in the snow,

03:05:50.294 --> 03:05:51.647
so it's easier for you to do things

03:05:51.647 --> 03:05:53.434
without being noticed.
SAM: I think I had to stoop over

03:05:53.434 --> 03:05:55.634
and retie my boot.

03:05:55.634 --> 03:05:56.484
While I'm down there,

03:05:56.484 --> 03:05:58.654
just tuck it into the snow and--

03:05:58.654 --> 03:06:00.594
MATT: All right, sleight of hand check.

03:06:00.594 --> 03:06:02.520
SAM: Okay.

03:06:02.520 --> 03:06:05.044
Ooh, terrible, 18.

03:06:05.044 --> 03:06:06.709
Oh wait, no, I have--
MATT: You have Reliable Talent.

03:06:06.709 --> 03:06:08.103
SAM: Reliable Talent, 25.

03:06:08.103 --> 03:06:11.624
MATT: (laughs) "Ooh, terrible! 25."

03:06:11.624 --> 03:06:12.482
You feel pretty confident

03:06:12.482 --> 03:06:15.404
that you sufficiently hid that in the snow.

03:06:15.404 --> 03:06:17.845
ASHLEY: Is he going to find it?

03:06:17.845 --> 03:06:19.284
LAURA: It's Dagen, he can find everything.

03:06:19.284 --> 03:06:20.424
He's super tracky.

03:06:20.424 --> 03:06:21.354
TALIESIN: He's literally on our trail.

03:06:21.354 --> 03:06:24.464
SAM: Oh boy, did we just Fargo all the money?

03:06:24.464 --> 03:06:25.577
TALIESIN: We'll be fine.

03:06:25.577 --> 03:06:26.754
LIAM: (like Fargo) Oh yah.

03:06:26.754 --> 03:06:28.996
Campaign three party'll find that.

03:06:28.996 --> 03:06:29.962
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)

03:06:29.962 --> 03:06:30.795
MATT: All right.
MARISHA: Whoa!

03:06:30.795 --> 03:06:31.664
MATT: So you continue on.

03:06:31.664 --> 03:06:33.987
LIAM: The heck do you mean?
TRAVIS: With the windshield scraper.

03:06:35.374 --> 03:06:38.733
MARISHA: Who's Es-seek?
LAURA: Oh, he's rolling, he's rolling.

03:06:40.204 --> 03:06:42.204
MATT: You continue on for the rest of the day.

03:06:42.204 --> 03:06:43.444
SAM: To be clear--

03:06:43.444 --> 03:06:44.527
MATT: Yes.
SAM: Sleight of hand

03:06:44.527 --> 03:06:45.894
to make sure they weren't looking,

03:06:45.894 --> 03:06:47.344
but I wasn't trying to hide it

03:06:47.344 --> 03:06:48.969
so that no one would ever find it.

03:06:48.969 --> 03:06:50.074
MATT: No, I understand that.

03:06:50.074 --> 03:06:52.432
I understand that. That's just a cursory roll.

03:06:52.432 --> 03:06:54.022
SAM: Sure, sure, sure.

03:06:54.022 --> 03:06:55.105
TRAVIS: Sure, sure.

03:06:56.780 --> 03:06:57.934
ASHLEY: Sure, sure, sure.

03:06:57.934 --> 03:07:00.734
MATT: Dusk does come, and you watch

03:07:00.734 --> 03:07:04.704
as the Tomb Takers stop their progress.

03:07:04.704 --> 03:07:07.831
Turning around, Lucien goes,

03:07:07.831 --> 03:07:11.023
"All right, we're real close.

03:07:11.023 --> 03:07:15.211
"So the choice is either we push on,

03:07:15.211 --> 03:07:18.081
"and I'd say about maybe two, three hours more

03:07:18.081 --> 03:07:20.201
"we might make our destination,

03:07:20.201 --> 03:07:23.001
"or if you're wishing for one more night of comfort,

03:07:23.001 --> 03:07:25.191
"which isn't a bad thing either,

03:07:25.191 --> 03:07:27.134
"we can take that, too."

03:07:27.134 --> 03:07:28.214
LIAM: I think some in our group

03:07:28.214 --> 03:07:30.874
are feeling a little peaked.

03:07:30.874 --> 03:07:33.354
Better if we take it fresh.

03:07:33.354 --> 03:07:34.187
MATT: "Very well.

03:07:37.924 --> 03:07:42.484
"So you're the man with the mansion."

03:07:42.484 --> 03:07:44.374
LIAM: Sure, I just want to find a good spot.

03:07:44.374 --> 03:07:46.007
Oh, right here, okay.

03:07:46.007 --> 03:07:48.934
LAURA: (giggles)
LIAM: (whooshing)

03:07:48.934 --> 03:07:52.084
MATT: All right, with that, you all enter to scatter

03:07:52.084 --> 03:07:53.804
about your evening of rest.

03:07:53.804 --> 03:07:55.104
What would you like to do?

03:07:57.574 --> 03:07:59.484
TRAVIS: The same thing as last night?

03:07:59.484 --> 03:08:01.444
SAM: Anybody need any...

03:08:01.444 --> 03:08:03.144
Do we need to call anyone

03:08:03.144 --> 03:08:04.324
or send word anywhere?

03:08:04.324 --> 03:08:05.814
LAURA: When we get alone, I would send

03:08:05.814 --> 03:08:07.747
another message to Dagen to see if he got it.

03:08:07.747 --> 03:08:08.844
MATT: Yeah, to expedite this,

03:08:08.844 --> 03:08:11.287
we don't even have to role play again the same scenario.

03:08:11.287 --> 03:08:13.662
You guys all, they go to, what I assume is the same room

03:08:13.662 --> 03:08:14.774
that was prepared the night before.

03:08:14.774 --> 03:08:16.094
LAURA: You're checking to make sure

03:08:16.094 --> 03:08:17.624
we got no invisible orbs around us.

03:08:17.624 --> 03:08:19.544
TRAVIS: No, I'm not doing that.

03:08:19.544 --> 03:08:20.444
SAM: It's there.

03:08:20.444 --> 03:08:21.749
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:08:21.749 --> 03:08:24.114
LAURA: (sighs)

03:08:24.114 --> 03:08:27.487
ASHLEY: They're always listening to everything.

03:08:27.487 --> 03:08:30.804
TRAVIS: I mean, if we find it, and Yasha dispels it,

03:08:30.804 --> 03:08:32.275
it'll come right back.

03:08:32.275 --> 03:08:33.214
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:08:33.214 --> 03:08:34.954
TRAVIS: He did it three times in one night.

03:08:34.954 --> 03:08:35.787
That's a lot.

03:08:38.414 --> 03:08:39.634
MATT: But dinner is had,

03:08:39.634 --> 03:08:43.434
and then eventually you all separate to...

03:08:43.434 --> 03:08:44.504
They separate to their chambers,

03:08:44.504 --> 03:08:45.914
and you guys can separate to yours,

03:08:45.914 --> 03:08:47.454
or like you did the night before,

03:08:47.454 --> 03:08:48.795
all cluster in the one.

03:08:48.795 --> 03:08:50.153
What would you like to do?
TALIESIN: Let's cluster.

03:08:50.153 --> 03:08:51.294
TRAVIS: I think we're clustering.

03:08:51.294 --> 03:08:53.614
I'm obviously going to be doing

03:08:53.614 --> 03:08:55.950
sleep-monitoring on you two.

03:08:55.950 --> 03:08:57.716
SAM: Oh yeah.
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

03:08:58.808 --> 03:09:00.811
MARISHA: Sleep-monitoring, okay.

03:09:00.811 --> 03:09:03.719
TRAVIS: Or do we just keep you awake?

03:09:03.719 --> 03:09:05.134
LAURA: No, they need to sleep.

03:09:05.134 --> 03:09:07.684
MARISHA: I would like to sleep.
TALIESIN: Okay, yeah.

03:09:07.684 --> 03:09:11.668
MARISHA: I got frozen to the side of a dragon today.

03:09:11.668 --> 03:09:12.764
TRAVIS: Sure, sure, sure.

03:09:12.764 --> 03:09:13.904
We'll just see if you come out of it

03:09:13.904 --> 03:09:15.722
with a second merit badge or not.

03:09:15.722 --> 03:09:16.831
MARISHA: (sighs)

03:09:20.321 --> 03:09:22.661
MATT: Any other business to handle before you sleep tonight?

03:09:22.661 --> 03:09:24.214
SAM: Before we go to sleep,

03:09:24.214 --> 03:09:27.879
I'll just quietly go over to Jester and say:

03:09:27.879 --> 03:09:31.811
I have this, well, I have one extra of these.

03:09:31.811 --> 03:09:32.801
Got it a while back.

03:09:32.801 --> 03:09:34.831
It's supposed to make

03:09:34.831 --> 03:09:37.132
your sexual experience very--

03:09:37.132 --> 03:09:39.241
LAURA: Oh god.
SAM: -- sort of heightened.

03:09:39.241 --> 03:09:40.511
I haven't used it yet.

03:09:40.511 --> 03:09:42.721
I gave one to my husband,

03:09:42.721 --> 03:09:43.991
but I have it.

03:09:43.991 --> 03:09:48.011
I'm giving it to you, just in case.

03:09:48.011 --> 03:09:51.694
I want your first time to be memorable.

03:09:51.694 --> 03:09:53.874
It's tiger blood or something, so.

03:09:53.874 --> 03:09:56.007
LAURA: It's just a little vial?
SAM: It's oil, it's oil.

03:09:56.007 --> 03:09:57.490
I don't know, I think--
LAURA: Where do you put it?

03:09:57.490 --> 03:09:58.506
SAM: I think you're supposed to rub it

03:09:58.506 --> 03:10:00.674
on your bits or maybe drink it?

03:10:00.674 --> 03:10:03.499
I didn't really get instructions.

03:10:03.499 --> 03:10:05.335
LAURA: That's a big difference!

03:10:05.335 --> 03:10:06.644
Nott! Veth!

03:10:06.644 --> 03:10:08.584
SAM: You'll figure it out.

03:10:08.584 --> 03:10:09.557
MARISHA: Is Essek--

03:10:09.557 --> 03:10:11.757
LAURA: Is there any fine print on the bottle?

03:10:13.284 --> 03:10:16.024
SAM: DM, is there any instruction?

03:10:16.024 --> 03:10:17.049
LAURA: On the--

03:10:17.049 --> 03:10:18.840
MATT: There is not.

03:10:18.840 --> 03:10:19.974
SAM: I think it's for drinking.

03:10:19.974 --> 03:10:21.534
I wrote down "sex potion,"

03:10:21.534 --> 03:10:23.424
so that means drinking, I think.

03:10:23.424 --> 03:10:24.427
TRAVIS: Oh boy.
SAM: We'll see.

03:10:24.427 --> 03:10:26.634
LAURA: Great, seems safe.

03:10:26.634 --> 03:10:27.717
SAM: Okay.
LAURA: Thanks,

03:10:27.717 --> 03:10:32.307
I'm sure I'll need it. (whistles)

03:10:32.307 --> 03:10:33.224
MARISHA: Caduceus.

03:10:34.124 --> 03:10:35.294
LAURA: Thank you.

03:10:35.294 --> 03:10:36.464
SAM: You're welcome.

03:10:36.464 --> 03:10:38.237
MATT: So you can write--

03:10:38.237 --> 03:10:39.370
LAURA: Sex potion.
MATT: Sex potion

03:10:39.370 --> 03:10:41.829
in your inventory.

03:10:41.829 --> 03:10:43.956
SAM: I'm deleting it from mine.

03:10:43.956 --> 03:10:46.778
(laughter)

03:10:46.778 --> 03:10:50.133
MARISHA: Can this be used to our benefit?

03:10:50.133 --> 03:10:51.954
TRAVIS: What are you guys talking about?

03:10:51.954 --> 03:10:52.824
TALIESIN: I'm going to run a--

03:10:52.824 --> 03:10:55.047
I'm going to do a Commune before we sleep.

03:10:56.084 --> 03:10:57.127
MATT: Okay.

03:10:59.746 --> 03:11:01.134
TALIESIN: I was going to ask about Essek.

03:11:01.134 --> 03:11:04.729
Maybe the eyes, anything else?

03:11:04.729 --> 03:11:05.947
Dagen, maybe?

03:11:07.544 --> 03:11:09.454
LAURA: I'm going to send a message to Dagen.

03:11:09.454 --> 03:11:10.779
MATT: Okay.

03:11:10.779 --> 03:11:12.294
TALIESIN: Actually, hold on one second.

03:11:12.294 --> 03:11:13.127
LAURA: Oh.

03:11:13.127 --> 03:11:14.947
TALIESIN: I can find out if Dagen already got the money.

03:11:14.947 --> 03:11:15.955
LAURA: Oh, okay.

03:11:15.955 --> 03:11:16.962
MARISHA: But we might be able to use

03:11:16.962 --> 03:11:18.474
that third question, though.

03:11:18.474 --> 03:11:20.438
TALIESIN: Yeah. Oh.
MARISHA: For something bigger.

03:11:20.438 --> 03:11:21.271
TALIESIN: That's fair.
LAURA: Yeah,

03:11:21.271 --> 03:11:22.867
I'll just send a message to Dagen,

03:11:22.867 --> 03:11:24.111
Hey, did you find the pouch?

03:11:24.111 --> 03:11:25.234
Are you on your way?

03:11:25.234 --> 03:11:26.354
How's it going?

03:11:28.801 --> 03:11:31.801
You're not just going to take the money and run, right?

03:11:34.951 --> 03:11:36.961
MATT: "I received it, don't worry.

03:11:36.961 --> 03:11:39.247
"Note read, money here.

03:11:40.866 --> 03:11:44.701
"I mean, it's a long way back, so...

03:11:46.951 --> 03:11:48.564
"to your friend."

03:11:48.564 --> 03:11:49.414
SAM: Nice.

03:11:49.414 --> 03:11:51.397
MATT: That's what you heard.
LAURA: Such a good guy.

03:11:51.397 --> 03:11:52.730
ASHLEY: Such a good guy.

03:11:54.700 --> 03:11:56.454
MATT: All right, and you're going to Commune, you said?

03:11:56.454 --> 03:11:57.984
TALIESIN: Yeah, does anyone got a third question?

03:11:57.984 --> 03:11:59.214
TRAVIS: They're yes or no, right?

03:11:59.214 --> 03:12:00.047
TALIESIN: Yep.
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:12:02.784 --> 03:12:05.083
LAURA: Do you drink this potion or...

03:12:05.083 --> 03:12:07.704
(laughter)

03:12:07.704 --> 03:12:09.704
TALIESIN: I think it's topical.

03:12:09.704 --> 03:12:11.697
It looks topical, it's very viscous.

03:12:12.934 --> 03:12:15.224
TRAVIS: What are your questions so far?

03:12:15.224 --> 03:12:17.694
TALIESIN: Is Essek planning on helping us?

03:12:17.694 --> 03:12:20.384
Can the eyes on Beau and Caleb

03:12:20.384 --> 03:12:21.607
be used against us?

03:12:22.957 --> 03:12:25.510
LIAM: Do the Tomb Takers intend to,

03:12:28.177 --> 03:12:30.957
just confirm it, use us as some sort of sacrifice.

03:12:30.957 --> 03:12:31.790
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:12:32.977 --> 03:12:35.770
TALIESIN: See if it works, I'm going for it.

03:12:37.127 --> 03:12:39.886
MATT: Okay. Casting Commune.

03:12:42.877 --> 03:12:46.767
TALIESIN: Does Essek plan on helping us at the moment?

03:12:46.767 --> 03:12:51.728
MATT: As you return to the gentle mind palace of the--

03:12:51.728 --> 03:12:54.267
(laughs) the Wild Mother, if you will.

03:12:54.267 --> 03:12:58.007
TALIESIN: Mind forest.
MATT: Mind forest in this one.

03:12:58.007 --> 03:13:00.437
So what's the question, one more time, to clarify?

03:13:00.437 --> 03:13:02.057
What's the question, one more time to clarify?

03:13:02.057 --> 03:13:05.220
TALIESIN: At the moment, does Essek plan on helping us?

03:13:06.107 --> 03:13:11.107
MATT: You see this distant star that twinkles,

03:13:11.267 --> 03:13:14.457
and when it does, you feel a sense of safety

03:13:14.457 --> 03:13:17.158
and familiarity that would confirm a yes.

03:13:17.158 --> 03:13:17.991
LAURA: Aw!

03:13:19.877 --> 03:13:22.727
TALIESIN: Can the eyes that have marked

03:13:22.727 --> 03:13:25.380
Beau and Caleb be used against us?

03:13:27.677 --> 03:13:30.627
MATT: The gentle seaside fog thickens

03:13:30.627 --> 03:13:33.887
and you're left with a sense of uncertainty.

03:13:33.887 --> 03:13:34.720
TALIESIN: Okay.

03:13:34.720 --> 03:13:35.970
MATT: Not very clear.

03:13:38.417 --> 03:13:41.837
TALIESIN: Do the Tomb Takers plan on sacrificing any of us

03:13:41.837 --> 03:13:43.480
once we reach our destination?

03:13:46.207 --> 03:13:47.740
MATT: There's a pause,

03:13:49.207 --> 03:13:53.917
like even her vision is challenged,

03:13:53.917 --> 03:13:56.722
but the

03:13:58.249 --> 03:14:02.099
cold ocean breeze comes through back into the jungle space

03:14:02.099 --> 03:14:05.542
where you're sitting, to let you feel like the answer is no.

03:14:05.542 --> 03:14:06.550
TALIESIN: Kind of no.

03:14:08.797 --> 03:14:09.660
Interesting.

03:14:13.217 --> 03:14:14.117
TRAVIS: We're followers.

03:14:15.267 --> 03:14:17.367
TALIESIN: Maybe--
LAURA: Yeah.

03:14:17.367 --> 03:14:18.480
TALIESIN: Maybe we're vessels.

03:14:20.187 --> 03:14:21.247
That's what I got.

03:14:21.247 --> 03:14:22.850
LAURA: Can I try a Commune, too?

03:14:23.947 --> 03:14:24.780
MATT: Sure.

03:14:25.967 --> 03:14:28.087
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to spend 10 minutes

03:14:28.995 --> 03:14:30.580
(laughs) sending a message,

03:14:31.597 --> 03:14:33.337
setting up a bunch of little stuff

03:14:33.337 --> 03:14:36.827
and just being like: Hey, Artie, come here.

03:14:36.827 --> 03:14:39.680
I have some questions to ask you.

03:14:39.680 --> 03:14:40.707
MATT: As you glance over to your left

03:14:40.707 --> 03:14:42.127
as you're saying that absentmindedly,

03:14:42.127 --> 03:14:43.177
you look to your left and he's sitting

03:14:43.177 --> 03:14:44.756
on the floor next to you and goes,

03:14:44.756 --> 03:14:46.754
"Yes, Jester, what can I do for you?"

03:14:46.754 --> 03:14:48.177
And you all see him arrive as well.

03:14:48.177 --> 03:14:49.605
And you're like, what the fuck?

03:14:49.605 --> 03:14:50.915
Her Commune's a little more direct.

03:14:50.915 --> 03:14:52.329
(laughter)
LAURA: Look, look.

03:14:52.329 --> 03:14:55.157
Look at Beau's hand, look at Caleb's shoulder.

03:14:55.157 --> 03:14:57.747
MATT: "Right, that is very curious.

03:14:57.747 --> 03:14:59.903
LAURA: Do you think--
MATT: "And frightening."

03:14:59.903 --> 03:15:03.230
LAURA: That that's something that we can reverse?

03:15:04.475 --> 03:15:08.307
MATT: "Mm, I'm certain there's probably a way."

03:15:08.307 --> 03:15:10.400
LAURA: Is it something at our disposal now?

03:15:11.727 --> 03:15:13.368
MATT: "Probably not.

03:15:15.035 --> 03:15:17.523
"I mean, look at him.

03:15:17.523 --> 03:15:20.167
"I don't know where it's from. Hmm!"

03:15:21.334 --> 03:15:22.659
LAURA: It's from...

03:15:22.659 --> 03:15:24.647
It's from the Eyes of Nine, dude.

03:15:24.647 --> 03:15:25.767
MATT: "No, I figured that.

03:15:25.767 --> 03:15:28.577
"I'm just saying, I don't know the scenario

03:15:28.577 --> 03:15:29.962
"around its connection."

03:15:29.962 --> 03:15:32.532
(laughter)

03:15:32.532 --> 03:15:34.357
"I'm an Archfey, I'm not an omniscient being."

03:15:34.357 --> 03:15:35.797
LAURA: Oh, oh, okay, what do you think?

03:15:35.797 --> 03:15:37.027
What do you think?

03:15:37.027 --> 03:15:38.327
Is there a way--
MARISHA: Useless.

03:15:38.327 --> 03:15:40.177
TRAVIS: Yeah.
LAURA: Based on some, like,

03:15:40.177 --> 03:15:44.427
well, I don't know, knowledge that you have,

03:15:44.427 --> 03:15:46.787
do you think there's a way we could use

03:15:46.787 --> 03:15:49.920
these markings to our advantage?

03:15:56.217 --> 03:15:57.190
MATT: "Here's the thing.

03:15:58.673 --> 03:16:02.157
"I have been many places and seen many things,

03:16:02.157 --> 03:16:03.570
"terrible and wonderful.

03:16:04.407 --> 03:16:08.208
"This? This creeps me right out."

03:16:08.208 --> 03:16:09.207
TALIESIN: Thank you.

03:16:09.207 --> 03:16:12.537
MATT: "I, unfortunately, don't have much to add.

03:16:12.537 --> 03:16:14.197
"I'd like to, I will, and I'm watching

03:16:14.197 --> 03:16:16.537
"and I'm genuinely a little disturbed

03:16:16.537 --> 03:16:18.557
"and worried for all of you.

03:16:18.557 --> 03:16:22.065
"But, ah, this is weird."

03:16:22.065 --> 03:16:22.906
LAURA: This is weird.

03:16:22.906 --> 03:16:25.087
MATT: "Beyond my bailiwick, sorry."

03:16:25.087 --> 03:16:27.157
LAURA: Okay, well, we're heading into,

03:16:27.157 --> 03:16:29.527
you know, the butthole of it all.

03:16:29.527 --> 03:16:31.897
So, really have our back here

03:16:31.897 --> 03:16:34.067
because I don't know what Lucien is planning,

03:16:34.067 --> 03:16:36.185
but I think it's something really terrible.

03:16:36.185 --> 03:16:39.837
MATT: "(sighs) Well, if you can suss out

03:16:39.837 --> 03:16:42.287
"what it is he wants of you, that would be useful."

03:16:43.197 --> 03:16:44.030
LAURA: Yeah.

03:16:45.247 --> 03:16:46.647
MATT: "Wish I could be more help."

03:16:48.337 --> 03:16:49.607
LAURA: Thank you.

03:16:49.607 --> 03:16:51.030
MATT: "Yeah, I'll be watching."

03:16:53.477 --> 03:16:55.113
TRAVIS: Did you say the word bailiwick?

03:16:55.113 --> 03:16:55.946
MATT: Yeah.

03:16:57.934 --> 03:17:00.127
(laughter)

03:17:00.127 --> 03:17:01.227
Area of expertise.

03:17:01.227 --> 03:17:03.060
TRAVIS: I know what that word means.

03:17:03.060 --> 03:17:06.285
(laughter)

03:17:08.667 --> 03:17:12.167
MATT: You all blink in unison and he's gone.

03:17:12.167 --> 03:17:13.317
Like a forced blink.

03:17:13.317 --> 03:17:14.217
It's a little odd.

03:17:19.447 --> 03:17:20.280
TALIESIN: Huh.

03:17:24.172 --> 03:17:26.017
LAURA: Hmm.
TALIESIN: That's interesting.

03:17:26.017 --> 03:17:28.397
I don't know, I might have a...

03:17:28.397 --> 03:17:29.367
Might have a crazy idea.

03:17:29.367 --> 03:17:30.467
We'll see how it goes.

03:17:30.467 --> 03:17:33.193
LAURA: Why don't you tell us what the idea is, Caduceus?

03:17:33.193 --> 03:17:34.147
TALIESIN: I'm just worried.

03:17:34.147 --> 03:17:35.257
I feel like we're being,

03:17:35.257 --> 03:17:37.147
I'm not used to this level of nervousness.

03:17:37.147 --> 03:17:38.297
It's really getting to me.

03:17:38.297 --> 03:17:40.047
MARISHA: Do charades.
TRAVIS: Do you want me to look--

03:17:40.047 --> 03:17:42.715
LAURA: Or write it down and pass it around, because--

03:17:42.715 --> 03:17:43.867
TALIESIN: I'm terrible at charades,

03:17:43.867 --> 03:17:46.427
and my handwriting's really bad.

03:17:46.427 --> 03:17:49.120
But as half of you know.
MARISHA: Pictographs.

03:17:49.120 --> 03:17:51.240
SAM: <i>Mummenschanz.</i>
ASHLEY: Sounds like.

03:17:51.240 --> 03:17:52.877
TALIESIN: So, if we have to,

03:17:52.877 --> 03:17:57.527
can we take the thing we have and put it somewhere

03:17:57.527 --> 03:18:01.517
where it really can't be gotten to anytime soon on a...

03:18:01.517 --> 03:18:02.467
Just like a little.

03:18:03.367 --> 03:18:05.060
LIAM: I can send a thing on its way.

03:18:05.977 --> 03:18:07.640
TALIESIN: If we have to pretty quickly.

03:18:10.587 --> 03:18:12.437
LIAM: Yeah, yeah.

03:18:12.437 --> 03:18:13.767
If you want to give me

03:18:14.667 --> 03:18:17.660
either my amber back or the bag with the amber in it,

03:18:18.657 --> 03:18:20.030
I could very quickly.

03:18:21.487 --> 03:18:24.257
LAURA: At any moment do it?
LIAM: Yeah, mm-hmm.

03:18:24.257 --> 03:18:26.233
TRAVIS: Yeah. I'll give him his amber.

03:18:26.233 --> 03:18:28.617
MATT: You look down, and your bag of holding is missing.

03:18:28.617 --> 03:18:30.284
MARISHA: Wait, what? Wait, what?

03:18:31.167 --> 03:18:32.727
TRAVIS: Otis.
SAM: I'm sorry?

03:18:32.727 --> 03:18:34.087
TRAVIS: Otis.

03:18:34.087 --> 03:18:36.147
SAM: When he was behind you?

03:18:36.147 --> 03:18:38.080
MARISHA: Motherfucker.

03:18:38.080 --> 03:18:39.717
Motherfucker.
LAURA: Are they still

03:18:39.717 --> 03:18:41.097
in the tower?

03:18:41.097 --> 03:18:42.197
SAM: I should've killed that

03:18:42.197 --> 03:18:43.059
little fucker.
TALIESIN: They are.

03:18:43.059 --> 03:18:45.666
We can send some cats to take it back.

03:18:45.666 --> 03:18:46.617
SAM: Knock on their door.

03:18:46.617 --> 03:18:47.450
MARISHA: Oh, cats. The cats.

03:18:47.450 --> 03:18:48.816
LAURA: They might be out of the tower.
SAM: Let's go kill them.

03:18:48.816 --> 03:18:49.949
Get the cats to steal it back.
MARISHA: Get the cat to steal it.

03:18:49.949 --> 03:18:52.669
Get the cat to steal it back.

03:18:52.669 --> 03:18:53.877
SAM: Frumpkin's mission.
MARISHA: Get the cats, get the cats,

03:18:53.877 --> 03:18:57.387
get the cats, get the cats.
SAM: Frumpkin's Mission: Impossible.

03:18:57.387 --> 03:18:58.917
TRAVIS: They might not even be in the tower.

03:18:58.917 --> 03:19:00.477
LAURA: They might be gone.
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

03:19:00.477 --> 03:19:01.737
SAM: Let's go to their rooms.

03:19:01.737 --> 03:19:03.037
Wait, no.
MARISHA: Oh my god.

03:19:03.037 --> 03:19:04.421
SAM: Have the cats go look. (gasps)

03:19:04.421 --> 03:19:06.197
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:19:06.197 --> 03:19:08.244
We don't want another fucking Vess DeRogna situation.

03:19:08.244 --> 03:19:11.162
TRAVIS: I'll ring the rope.
SAM: Toto, Sprocket.

03:19:11.162 --> 03:19:13.581
(laughter)
MATT: (meowing)

03:19:13.581 --> 03:19:15.067
LAURA: Mittens.

03:19:15.067 --> 03:19:17.145
MARISHA: I'll get Mittens, Mittens is slow as fuck.

03:19:17.145 --> 03:19:19.372
TRAVIS: I'm running out of the room and shouting, "Down,"

03:19:19.372 --> 03:19:21.047
and going straight down to the bottom,

03:19:21.047 --> 03:19:22.437
just in case they left

03:19:22.437 --> 03:19:25.477
and heading out the door of the--

03:19:25.477 --> 03:19:27.460
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:19:29.987 --> 03:19:31.217
TRAVIS: 22.

03:19:31.217 --> 03:19:32.157
MATT: Shit.

03:19:32.157 --> 03:19:33.867
You open the door and you look outside

03:19:33.867 --> 03:19:35.467
and there is snowfall.

03:19:35.467 --> 03:19:37.927
Not enough to wipe out the fresher series

03:19:37.927 --> 03:19:39.445
of footprints that are leading away from the door of the--

03:19:39.445 --> 03:19:41.487
LAURA: They took it!
MARISHA: Son of a bitch!

03:19:41.487 --> 03:19:43.153
SAM: They Mighty Nein'd us!

03:19:43.153 --> 03:19:45.787
(laughter)

03:19:45.787 --> 03:19:47.587
MARISHA: They stole our idea.
LAURA: We should go.

03:19:47.587 --> 03:19:48.420
We could go.

03:19:48.420 --> 03:19:49.253
We just go after them, right now.

03:19:49.253 --> 03:19:50.767
TRAVIS: I shoot three Eldritch Blasts

03:19:50.767 --> 03:19:51.827
into the bottom of the tower,

03:19:51.827 --> 03:19:53.227
because nobody will be able to hear me anyway.

03:19:53.227 --> 03:19:54.087
I'm like (whooshing).

03:19:54.087 --> 03:19:55.197
Just setting off explosions.

03:19:55.197 --> 03:19:56.598
MATT: You hear (whooshing).

03:19:56.598 --> 03:19:59.257
These heavy impact sounds.
MARISHA: We rush downstairs.

03:19:59.257 --> 03:20:01.587
MATT: Y'all rush down and see Fjord at the base of the tower

03:20:01.587 --> 03:20:03.884
looking really frustrated.

03:20:03.884 --> 03:20:05.097
TRAVIS: Footprints!

03:20:05.097 --> 03:20:06.558
TALIESIN: So--
SAM: What's happening?

03:20:06.558 --> 03:20:08.267
They're gone.
MARISHA: They can't have been gone long, right?

03:20:08.267 --> 03:20:10.150
We've been in the room for 15 minutes.

03:20:10.150 --> 03:20:11.187
SAM: How long has it been?
ASHLEY: I'll go check

03:20:11.187 --> 03:20:12.317
in the room that they were in.

03:20:12.317 --> 03:20:14.517
MATT: All right, so right,
you go run in the room they were in?

03:20:14.517 --> 03:20:16.531
You rush in there and glance, it's empty.

03:20:16.531 --> 03:20:19.067
MARISHA: Fucking bitches!
LAURA: Just take off after them.

03:20:19.067 --> 03:20:19.900
Take off after them.

03:20:19.900 --> 03:20:22.177
MATT: After you guys ate and went to your respective rooms,

03:20:22.177 --> 03:20:25.117
it's probably been, I'd say from travel, sitting,

03:20:25.117 --> 03:20:26.507
resting and getting to a comfortable space,

03:20:26.507 --> 03:20:27.957
it's been about 30 or so minutes.

03:20:27.957 --> 03:20:30.777
LAURA: Did they eat with us before we went to our rooms?

03:20:30.777 --> 03:20:31.610
MATT: Hmm?

03:20:31.610 --> 03:20:32.443
LAURA: Did they eat with us before we went

03:20:32.443 --> 03:20:33.445
to our rooms or did--
MATT: They did.

03:20:33.445 --> 03:20:34.278
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay,

03:20:34.278 --> 03:20:37.297
so 30 minutes since we split off.

03:20:37.297 --> 03:20:38.917
LIAM: Now, Jester, we could do our thing.

03:20:38.917 --> 03:20:40.507
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: We could fly.

03:20:40.507 --> 03:20:41.358
LAURA: Yeah.

03:20:41.358 --> 03:20:43.374
LIAM: Like we always do.
LAURA: God dangit.

03:20:43.374 --> 03:20:44.790
We used so many spells

03:20:44.790 --> 03:20:46.482
from the fucking dragon.
LIAM: People are exhausted

03:20:46.482 --> 03:20:48.065
and slots are down.
SAM: I kill Fjord.

03:20:49.551 --> 03:20:51.409
(laughter)

03:20:51.409 --> 03:20:52.310
TALIESIN: That's the other thing, though,

03:20:52.310 --> 03:20:54.047
is they're not going to sleep.

03:20:54.047 --> 03:20:56.214
Which means if we sleep--
MARISHA: Oh, shit.

03:20:56.214 --> 03:20:58.155
LAURA: Yeah, we can't sleep.
TRAVIS: The squat betrays you.

03:20:58.155 --> 03:20:59.999
(laughter)

03:20:59.999 --> 03:21:00.947
MARISHA: Betrayed.

03:21:00.947 --> 03:21:03.297
TALIESIN: I mean, if we sleep and then fly to catch up.

03:21:04.298 --> 03:21:05.647
LAURA: No.
LIAM: They said we were

03:21:05.647 --> 03:21:07.851
three or four hours away.
LAURA: They're a few hours away.

03:21:07.851 --> 03:21:11.447
We could Polymorph ourselves and go after them right now.

03:21:11.447 --> 03:21:13.017
LIAM: We could beat them there now.

03:21:13.017 --> 03:21:14.230
SAM: Maybe.

03:21:15.547 --> 03:21:17.257
Do you guys have enough Polymorph to get us there?

03:21:17.257 --> 03:21:18.290
LIAM: We could. They didn't cover

03:21:18.290 --> 03:21:19.807
three hours of territory in a half hour.

03:21:19.807 --> 03:21:20.640
LAURA: We can get ahead of them

03:21:20.640 --> 03:21:22.748
if we Polymorph for an hour.
SAM: Unless they have some tricks

03:21:22.748 --> 03:21:24.407
that we don't know about?

03:21:24.407 --> 03:21:25.240
LAURA: They would've done it.

03:21:25.240 --> 03:21:26.467
TALIESIN: We also, now that we know they're gone,

03:21:26.467 --> 03:21:27.637
we can talk in here.

03:21:27.637 --> 03:21:30.096
TRAVIS: Go, whatever the fastest thing is, do it, now.

03:21:30.096 --> 03:21:31.887
LAURA: Polymorph.
LIAM: He's been, yeah.

03:21:31.887 --> 03:21:32.857
LAURA: Should we get ahead of them,

03:21:32.857 --> 03:21:34.543
Or should we drop on them?

03:21:34.543 --> 03:21:35.784
TRAVIS: On them.

03:21:35.784 --> 03:21:37.450
MARISHA: And fuck them up and kill them?

03:21:37.450 --> 03:21:39.577
TRAVIS: I just want the bag back.
MARISHA: Get the bag back?

03:21:39.577 --> 03:21:40.987
SAM: Wait, wait.

03:21:40.987 --> 03:21:42.347
LAURA: They've got all of our stuff.

03:21:42.347 --> 03:21:43.180
LIAM: Yeah, keep it--
SAM: I know,

03:21:43.180 --> 03:21:45.107
but, I would say go ahead of them.

03:21:45.107 --> 03:21:46.747
ASHLEY: Yeah, I was thinking that, too.

03:21:46.747 --> 03:21:47.667
TALIESIN: Cut them off at the pass.
LAURA: But we don't know

03:21:47.667 --> 03:21:49.877
where they're going to go exactly.

03:21:49.877 --> 03:21:52.830
ASHLEY: Is there a way we can follow them? No.

03:21:52.830 --> 03:21:54.877
SAM: We know the general vicinity they're going.

03:21:54.877 --> 03:21:57.250
We could catch up to them and follow them.

03:21:59.537 --> 03:22:02.127
If we demand that bag now, it's a fight.

03:22:02.127 --> 03:22:03.465
MARISHA: I have an idea.
SAM: It's a fight.

03:22:03.465 --> 03:22:05.084
TRAVIS: It could be. It could be.

03:22:05.084 --> 03:22:06.547
LIAM: It could be or we go along.

03:22:06.547 --> 03:22:08.427
We're not going to trail behind them

03:22:08.427 --> 03:22:09.987
without them knowing we're there.

03:22:09.987 --> 03:22:12.697
MARISHA: We might be able to find out that hidden entrance

03:22:12.697 --> 03:22:14.847
that they're talking about.

03:22:14.847 --> 03:22:16.997
LIAM: No to her, not to you.

03:22:16.997 --> 03:22:19.097
ASHLEY: If we were to get there before they did?

03:22:20.167 --> 03:22:21.207
TALIESIN: I don't have, I...

03:22:21.207 --> 03:22:22.607
Tomorrow I could have a spell for that,

03:22:22.607 --> 03:22:23.637
but I don't have it now.

03:22:23.637 --> 03:22:25.904
LAURA: Nope.
MARISHA: We could ask the Somnovem.

03:22:27.587 --> 03:22:28.520
SAM: Ask them what?

03:22:29.767 --> 03:22:31.377
MARISHA: Where it is.
SAM: You two could?

03:22:31.377 --> 03:22:32.667
Because you talk to them now?

03:22:32.667 --> 03:22:33.910
MARISHA: I could dream.

03:22:35.297 --> 03:22:37.177
LAURA: Yeah, but you don't know when in a dream.

03:22:37.177 --> 03:22:41.087
It could be, like, four hours into sleep when you dream.

03:22:41.087 --> 03:22:42.587
They'd already be there.

03:22:42.587 --> 03:22:43.867
MARISHA: We could move.

03:22:43.867 --> 03:22:45.487
You guys could carry me or something.

03:22:45.487 --> 03:22:47.480
I don't know, while we're moving.

03:22:48.815 --> 03:22:50.777
(laughter)

03:22:50.777 --> 03:22:52.427
ASHLEY: I can carry her.
LAURA: I mean, if we can do that,

03:22:52.427 --> 03:22:55.027
then why the fuck couldn't we heal that other time?

03:22:55.027 --> 03:22:55.860
TALIESIN: Yeah, you can't sleep.

03:22:55.860 --> 03:22:57.052
LAURA: You can't sleep while we're traveling.

03:22:57.052 --> 03:23:00.057
SAM: You can dream while we're carrying you.

03:23:00.057 --> 03:23:03.407
TRAVIS: We should get moving and
even see if we can see them.

03:23:03.407 --> 03:23:04.240
If not, we're flying

03:23:04.240 --> 03:23:07.057
towards the northwest corner of Aeor anyway, right?

03:23:07.057 --> 03:23:08.077
SAM: Yep.
MARISHA: I mean, this could be--

03:23:08.077 --> 03:23:09.399
LAURA: We should turn into giant owls

03:23:09.399 --> 03:23:11.577
or something, so that we have night vision.

03:23:11.577 --> 03:23:12.827
MATT: You do have a bead on tracks.

03:23:12.827 --> 03:23:14.227
So, if somebody wants to take point on that,

03:23:14.227 --> 03:23:15.447
you could continue to track.

03:23:15.447 --> 03:23:17.967
MARISHA: Who's got good survival?
TRAVIS: Not me.

03:23:17.967 --> 03:23:19.047
SAM: I've got investigation,

03:23:19.047 --> 03:23:21.087
but I don't know if it's that or survival.

03:23:21.087 --> 03:23:22.040
TALIESIN: Where are you at?
LAURA: Mine's plus five.

03:23:22.040 --> 03:23:23.517
ASHLEY: Plus five, yeah.
TALIESIN: Five as well.

03:23:23.517 --> 03:23:24.830
SAM: Survival to follow the tracks?

03:23:24.830 --> 03:23:26.957
LIAM: In the wilderness.
MATT: Survival to keep up

03:23:26.957 --> 03:23:29.767
with the tracks, or if you're looking for them,

03:23:29.767 --> 03:23:30.600
and to continue.

03:23:30.600 --> 03:23:33.117
Perception, if you are aware of where they are, to maintain.

03:23:33.117 --> 03:23:35.477
So even just finding tracks is more survival.

03:23:35.477 --> 03:23:37.227
But once you know where they are,

03:23:37.227 --> 03:23:39.043
then you can use either survival or perception, I'd say.

03:23:39.043 --> 03:23:41.407
LAURA: Oh, okay, so perception would be great.

03:23:41.407 --> 03:23:43.057
TALIESIN: Both of us are great.
LAURA: Yeah.

03:23:43.057 --> 03:23:43.997
MATT: Problem is, you have no light,

03:23:43.997 --> 03:23:45.277
and it is nighttime.
TRAVIS: I didn't even roll

03:23:45.277 --> 03:23:47.040
a perception check.
MATT: So rolls would be

03:23:47.040 --> 03:23:49.237
at disadvantage, just so you know.

03:23:49.237 --> 03:23:51.048
MARISHA: Unless we're like, eagles or some shit.

03:23:51.048 --> 03:23:53.422
MATT: Right. Unless you're a creature with night vision.

03:23:53.422 --> 03:23:55.817
LIAM: Or if you use a cantrip.
TALIESIN: Can I use your goggles?

03:23:55.817 --> 03:23:57.554
MARISHA: No.
SAM: Let us be seen.

03:23:57.554 --> 03:24:00.111
MARISHA: For what?
TALIESIN: Tracking.

03:24:00.111 --> 03:24:01.086
MARISHA: Are you tracking?

03:24:01.086 --> 03:24:02.870
TALIESIN: I mean, I could, if I could see.

03:24:02.870 --> 03:24:05.127
SAM: We should use light for as long as we can,

03:24:05.127 --> 03:24:08.218
and then ditch it when we feel like we're getting close?

03:24:08.218 --> 03:24:10.745
TRAVIS: They'll see us coming.
LAURA: How do we know if we're getting close?

03:24:10.745 --> 03:24:12.757
MARISHA: (laughs)

03:24:12.757 --> 03:24:14.031
TRAVIS: Yeah, they'll see us coming, we should--

03:24:14.031 --> 03:24:15.327
LAURA: We should just fuckin'--
We should be having

03:24:15.327 --> 03:24:16.777
this conversation while we're following.

03:24:16.777 --> 03:24:18.737
MATT: I assume you guys are moving, since you said that.

03:24:18.737 --> 03:24:21.207
So you guys are out in the middle of the freezing snow,

03:24:21.207 --> 03:24:23.385
tower door closed behind you.

03:24:23.385 --> 03:24:25.497
(whistling) It's cold as fuck,

03:24:25.497 --> 03:24:26.537
and you're already feeling

03:24:26.537 --> 03:24:29.287
the wind cutting through your thicker outfits.

03:24:29.287 --> 03:24:30.827
But you can keep going.

03:24:30.827 --> 03:24:32.377
SAM: Is it snowing?
MATT: It is snowing, yes.

03:24:32.377 --> 03:24:36.217
SAM: Okay, I'm going to take a long,
hard look at the prints,

03:24:36.217 --> 03:24:39.777
and try to remember how deep they are.

03:24:39.777 --> 03:24:42.667
So when we get closer and they're deeper, I'll--

03:24:42.667 --> 03:24:44.467
MATT: It's not a heavy snow, thankfully.

03:24:46.007 --> 03:24:48.867
With expediency, you could catch up,

03:24:48.867 --> 03:24:51.207
but within probably an hour or so,

03:24:51.207 --> 03:24:53.357
those prints are going to be real hard to find.

03:24:53.357 --> 03:24:55.557
SAM: Mm-hmm, okay.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:24:55.557 --> 03:24:57.447
Spin it up.

03:24:57.447 --> 03:24:58.947
MARISHA: Half with owls, half riding?

03:25:01.852 --> 03:25:03.964
SAM: Are we following tracks? We need to be on land.

03:25:03.964 --> 03:25:05.887
LIAM: Yeah.

03:25:05.887 --> 03:25:08.007
SAM: Or are you guys polymorphing into horses, or something?

03:25:08.007 --> 03:25:09.807
MARISHA: Right above the tracks.
LAURA: I was going to polymorph into owls

03:25:09.807 --> 03:25:10.947
and we can just fly above them,

03:25:10.947 --> 03:25:12.139
but it's up to you guys.

03:25:12.139 --> 03:25:13.096
TRAVIS: No, no, owls are great.

03:25:13.096 --> 03:25:15.221
Fly above the ground, so we can see the tracks.

03:25:16.337 --> 03:25:17.327
SAM: Okay.

03:25:17.327 --> 03:25:19.329
MARISHA: Still get a fly speed,
just fly low to the ground.

03:25:19.329 --> 03:25:20.677
LAURA: But if we can catch up

03:25:20.677 --> 03:25:21.667
to them without the owls,

03:25:21.667 --> 03:25:23.787
then we should save the spell slots.

03:25:23.787 --> 03:25:26.840
LIAM: Also, all perception and everything goes to owl stats,

03:25:27.697 --> 03:25:29.117
not your hero stats.

03:25:29.117 --> 03:25:31.387
LAURA: They'll see from us flying.

03:25:31.387 --> 03:25:32.675
They can use their eyes.

03:25:32.675 --> 03:25:33.757
LIAM: Yeah.

03:25:33.757 --> 03:25:34.590
LAURA: So.

03:25:34.590 --> 03:25:35.423
MATT: They still would need darkvision

03:25:35.423 --> 03:25:37.584
to be able to not roll with disadvantage.

03:25:37.584 --> 03:25:38.600
LAURA: Right.
LIAM: No.

03:25:39.567 --> 03:25:41.865
My perception will suck, but yours will be good.

03:25:41.865 --> 03:25:42.698
MARISHA: But mine will be fine.

03:25:42.698 --> 03:25:43.531
LIAM: But you need these guys.

03:25:43.531 --> 03:25:45.631
MARISHA: Yes.
TRAVIS: I have darkvision, too.

03:25:45.631 --> 03:25:46.567
ASHLEY: I have darkvision.

03:25:46.567 --> 03:25:48.337
SAM: Okay. Owl it up, then.

03:25:48.337 --> 03:25:49.707
MARISHA: Your perception's higher than mine, right?

03:25:49.707 --> 03:25:51.510
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.
MARISHA: I toss them to Caduceus.

03:25:51.510 --> 03:25:53.166
TALIESIN: Thank you, I love you.
TRAVIS: Thanks for healing me.

03:25:53.166 --> 03:25:55.107
(laughter)

03:25:55.107 --> 03:25:56.028
TALIESIN: Make my eyes look big.

03:25:56.028 --> 03:25:58.067
MARISHA: Caduceus is doing the perception checks.

03:25:58.067 --> 03:25:59.520
MATT: All righty.
LIAM: Right.

03:26:00.627 --> 03:26:02.128
MATT: So.

03:26:02.128 --> 03:26:03.957
LIAM: (whooshing) (hooting)

03:26:03.957 --> 03:26:05.495
MATT: You're going owl.
LIAM: Owl.

03:26:05.495 --> 03:26:07.417
TRAVIS: Otis, god.
MATT: Who else is going owl?

03:26:07.417 --> 03:26:08.467
SAM: I should've fucking killed--

03:26:08.467 --> 03:26:11.025
LAURA: I guess I'll turn myself and--
TRAVIS: I didn't even get a perception check.

03:26:11.025 --> 03:26:12.247
MATT: Passive perception,

03:26:12.247 --> 03:26:14.121
which is 12 for you, so.

03:26:14.121 --> 03:26:15.882
TRAVIS: You don't have to rub it in.

03:26:15.882 --> 03:26:20.032
LAURA: I'll turn me and Yasha into owls as well.

03:26:20.032 --> 03:26:22.127
MATT: All right, three night owls.

03:26:22.127 --> 03:26:23.077
Go for it.

03:26:23.077 --> 03:26:24.277
The rest of you jump on?

03:26:25.149 --> 03:26:26.417
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: So it's three night owls

03:26:26.417 --> 03:26:27.250
and four of you.

03:26:27.250 --> 03:26:28.707
Who's riding on who?

03:26:28.707 --> 03:26:29.540
SAM: I'm on Caleb.

03:26:31.057 --> 03:26:32.547
MARISHA: I'll be on Yasha.

03:26:32.547 --> 03:26:33.555
TALIESIN: I'll take Yasha as well.

03:26:33.555 --> 03:26:35.249
SAM: What?

03:26:35.249 --> 03:26:36.157
MATT: You already cast Fly.

03:26:36.157 --> 03:26:37.497
So who are you jumping on?

03:26:37.497 --> 03:26:38.748
TRAVIS: Whoever.

03:26:38.748 --> 03:26:39.581
Jester?
LAURA: Yeah.

03:26:39.581 --> 03:26:40.962
TALIESIN: Split up the clerics.

03:26:40.962 --> 03:26:41.795
LAURA: Yeah.

03:26:41.795 --> 03:26:43.177
MARISHA: Yeah, no, I'm just fucking with you.

03:26:43.177 --> 03:26:44.697
MATT: Okay.

03:26:44.697 --> 03:26:46.337
I would say probably travel with Veth on Caleb,

03:26:46.337 --> 03:26:48.667
just for a weight scenario,

03:26:48.667 --> 03:26:50.477
with the storm blowing in, because it is windy,

03:26:50.477 --> 03:26:51.514
so it's slowing you back a little bit.

03:26:51.514 --> 03:26:54.347
But you guys start looking.

03:26:54.347 --> 03:26:56.377
So for the first length of this,

03:26:56.377 --> 03:26:57.888
what's the speed, the fly speed?

03:26:57.888 --> 03:26:58.877
LAURA: I don't have anybody on me,

03:26:58.877 --> 03:27:00.527
so Fjord could be on me.

03:27:00.527 --> 03:27:02.339
MATT: Oh, sorry, I thought--

03:27:02.339 --> 03:27:05.097
LAURA: Veth is on Caleb, Caduceus--
SAM: Caduceus and Beau are on--

03:27:05.097 --> 03:27:08.827
MATT: Oh, both of you are on there.
LAURA: So Caduceus should be on Caleb.

03:27:08.827 --> 03:27:10.547
MATT: For the purposes of, well...

03:27:11.558 --> 03:27:13.184
You don't weigh too much.
SAM: I'll go on Yasha with Beau.

03:27:13.184 --> 03:27:14.867
Caduceus, you can go on Caleb solo.

03:27:14.867 --> 03:27:16.010
MATT: That'll work.
TALIESIN: That'll do.

03:27:16.010 --> 03:27:17.757
MATT: Just from a weight distribution, the wind blowing,

03:27:17.757 --> 03:27:19.117
it'll slow you down otherwise.

03:27:19.117 --> 03:27:20.227
TALIESIN: All right.

03:27:20.227 --> 03:27:21.387
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: (hooting)

03:27:21.387 --> 03:27:23.597
MATT: First length of this,
go ahead and make a perception check.

03:27:23.597 --> 03:27:26.397
Anybody who is watching this.

03:27:26.397 --> 03:27:27.588
You have darkvision?
TRAVIS: I do.

03:27:27.588 --> 03:27:29.007
MATT: Go ahead and roll perception check.

03:27:29.007 --> 03:27:30.207
Roll a perception check.

03:27:33.287 --> 03:27:34.120
TRAVIS: Natural 19,

03:27:34.120 --> 03:27:35.076
so, 22.
MATT: You can make one with

03:27:35.076 --> 03:27:35.909
disadvantage if you want to.

03:27:35.909 --> 03:27:37.287
MARISHA: Sure.
TALIESIN: 26.

03:27:37.287 --> 03:27:38.120
TRAVIS: 22.

03:27:38.997 --> 03:27:39.937
MATT: Nice.

03:27:39.937 --> 03:27:42.827
MARISHA: That's a natural one with that disadvantage.

03:27:42.827 --> 03:27:46.217
ASHLEY: Do I, mm.
SAM: No, you're--

03:27:46.217 --> 03:27:48.367
MATT: If you want to as eagles, you can.

03:27:48.367 --> 03:27:50.537
I'm generally, for this, I'm taking two people

03:27:50.537 --> 03:27:52.947
doing the check as the guiding part,

03:27:52.947 --> 03:27:54.487
rather than doing all rolls over and over again.

03:27:54.487 --> 03:27:55.737
LAURA: Yeah, that makes sense.

03:27:56.667 --> 03:27:57.621
MATT: So with that,

03:27:57.621 --> 03:28:00.747
Caduceus, you have a very solid bead on the tracks.

03:28:00.747 --> 03:28:02.137
They're starting to fade from the snowfall,

03:28:02.137 --> 03:28:03.557
but you know the direction they're going

03:28:03.557 --> 03:28:05.237
and keeping tabs on it.

03:28:05.237 --> 03:28:08.430
You guys continue following Caduceus' guidance.

03:28:09.897 --> 03:28:12.107
I take it, the eagle, or the owls

03:28:12.107 --> 03:28:14.207
are you trying to be stealthy in approach?

03:28:14.207 --> 03:28:15.987
LIAM: Yes.
LAURA: They're stealthy creatures.

03:28:15.987 --> 03:28:17.237
MATT: Indeed, so I would like to stealth checks

03:28:17.237 --> 03:28:18.637
from the three eagles, if you don't mind.

03:28:18.637 --> 03:28:19.470
LIAM: Okay.

03:28:20.997 --> 03:28:22.307
LAURA: Okay.

03:28:22.307 --> 03:28:23.140
LIAM: This one?

03:28:23.140 --> 03:28:26.087
MATT: All three of the owls. Brain.

03:28:26.087 --> 03:28:31.007
MARISHA: What if we just grab Otis with some claws,

03:28:31.007 --> 03:28:32.797
and just keep going?

03:28:32.797 --> 03:28:34.437
TRAVIS: If he hasn't handed it off.

03:28:34.437 --> 03:28:36.657
LAURA: What do we add to that, dexterity?

03:28:36.657 --> 03:28:38.628
TALIESIN: He's got one of attached
to him anyway, doesn't he?

03:28:38.628 --> 03:28:39.647
LAURA: F-F-four.

03:28:39.647 --> 03:28:40.907
MATT: Four, okay.

03:28:40.907 --> 03:28:42.114
TALIESIN: That wouldn't matter, he's got one on his back.

03:28:42.114 --> 03:28:42.947
LIAM: 13.
MATT: 13.

03:28:42.947 --> 03:28:43.780
ASHLEY: Nine.

03:28:43.780 --> 03:28:45.518
TALIESIN: He's carrying one anyway.

03:28:45.518 --> 03:28:47.101
MARISHA: A backpack?

03:28:47.101 --> 03:28:47.969
TALIESIN: One of the big things.

03:28:47.969 --> 03:28:49.924
LIAM: Plus four, stealth.
MARISHA: Oh, yeah.

03:28:49.924 --> 03:28:50.757
LIAM: Giant owl.

03:28:50.757 --> 03:28:52.514
MARISHA: That's true, just get--
LAURA: Plus four?

03:28:52.514 --> 03:28:54.357
ASHLEY: Plus four on top of--

03:28:54.357 --> 03:28:57.127
LIAM: Plus four to whatever you roll for giant owl.

03:28:57.127 --> 03:28:58.890
It's not Yasha's stats, it's giant owl stats.

03:28:58.890 --> 03:29:01.057
ASHLEY: Got it, so 10.
LIAM: And they have two skills,

03:29:01.057 --> 03:29:01.890
perception and stealth.

03:29:01.890 --> 03:29:03.487
MATT: They have a 60-foot speed in the air,

03:29:03.487 --> 03:29:05.677
so you guys will be able to keep up in twice the time,

03:29:05.677 --> 03:29:08.237
or in half the time.

03:29:08.237 --> 03:29:09.807
So for the first length of this,

03:29:09.807 --> 03:29:11.087
which is catching up

03:29:11.087 --> 03:29:13.747
to where they were when you guys started this journey,

03:29:13.747 --> 03:29:16.387
go ahead and roll another perception check

03:29:16.387 --> 03:29:19.677
for the two of you, and you with disadvantage, Beauregard,

03:29:19.677 --> 03:29:21.977
to see if you can maintain for the second leg.

03:29:22.917 --> 03:29:24.270
MARISHA: Oh wow.
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

03:29:25.366 --> 03:29:28.474
MATT: For a total of?
TALIESIN: 32.

03:29:28.474 --> 03:29:30.065
MARISHA: 19.
TRAVIS: 19.

03:29:30.065 --> 03:29:31.924
TALIESIN: Using my Guidance.

03:29:31.924 --> 03:29:36.924
MATT: Caduceus, you are the
eyes of this, through and through.

03:29:37.017 --> 03:29:39.808
You, about another 20 or so minutes into this,

03:29:39.808 --> 03:29:43.074
You, about another 20 or so minutes into this,

03:29:44.137 --> 03:29:48.920
begin to see them at a distance through the dark.

03:29:52.667 --> 03:29:54.727
TALIESIN: They're coming, right over there.

03:29:54.727 --> 03:29:56.394
We've got them.
MATT: I'd like the owls to make

03:29:56.394 --> 03:29:58.067
one more stealth check on approach here.

03:29:59.537 --> 03:30:02.387
MARISHA: Are we grabbing and going?
SAM: Do we have Locate Object?

03:30:04.237 --> 03:30:05.127
MARISHA: Caduceus has a point.

03:30:05.127 --> 03:30:06.727
If Otis has one on his backpack,

03:30:06.727 --> 03:30:08.557
we don't necessarily need the one that we got.

03:30:08.557 --> 03:30:09.627
We just need a threshold--

03:30:09.627 --> 03:30:12.337
SAM: Does Otis have one on his backpack?

03:30:12.337 --> 03:30:13.507
TALIESIN: Otis has got one on his back.

03:30:13.507 --> 03:30:14.967
LAURA: Not Otis.
SAM: No, the big guy.

03:30:14.967 --> 03:30:16.827
TALIESIN: The big guy.
LAURA: Zoran?

03:30:16.827 --> 03:30:18.532
MATT: Zoran has the big one on his back, yes.

03:30:18.532 --> 03:30:20.059
TRAVIS: Carrying a goliath away is different

03:30:20.059 --> 03:30:23.414
than carrying a halfling away.

03:30:23.414 --> 03:30:26.117
We could try and make a swipe for Otis and then negotiate,

03:30:26.117 --> 03:30:27.957
But if he doesn't have it, we don't have any leverage.

03:30:27.957 --> 03:30:28.987
LAURA: No.
MATT: So who's doing what?

03:30:28.987 --> 03:30:29.847
Locate what?
MARISHA: It just depends

03:30:29.847 --> 03:30:30.800
on who has what.

03:30:33.591 --> 03:30:36.944
He was asking if there was a
Locate Object spell anybody had.

03:30:36.944 --> 03:30:38.847
LAURA: I don't have it.
TALIESIN: Nope.

03:30:38.847 --> 03:30:39.680
Tomorrow.

03:30:39.680 --> 03:30:41.180
MATT: You'd have to make a good guess, then.

03:30:43.537 --> 03:30:46.427
LAURA: As we go, I'm going to try to swoop in

03:30:46.427 --> 03:30:48.457
and just grab the backpack off of--

03:30:48.457 --> 03:30:49.290
SAM: If you--

03:30:49.290 --> 03:30:51.264
Do we see it?

03:30:51.264 --> 03:30:53.287
MATT: See what?
LAURA: We can see Zoran walking.

03:30:53.287 --> 03:30:54.787
MATT: You can see Zoran walking with the pack.

03:30:54.787 --> 03:30:57.420
SAM: Oh, got it.
MATT: The heavy wrapping he has,

03:30:57.420 --> 03:31:00.857
this leather wrapping around the stone.

03:31:00.857 --> 03:31:03.407
MARISHA: We got three eagles, we can make one go for Otis,

03:31:03.407 --> 03:31:04.601
one go for the pack,

03:31:04.601 --> 03:31:07.188
and one go for the lightest person

03:31:07.188 --> 03:31:08.021
and the other lightest person.

03:31:08.021 --> 03:31:11.187
LIAM: We see individual, each of them in the group?

03:31:11.187 --> 03:31:12.020
MATT: You do, yes.

03:31:12.020 --> 03:31:13.617
LIAM: Okay, I'm going to go for Otis.

03:31:13.617 --> 03:31:18.037
LAURA: I rolled a 19 on stealth.
MATT: 19 on stealth, okay.

03:31:18.037 --> 03:31:19.728
LIAM: 13, again.
MATT: 13.

03:31:20.596 --> 03:31:22.207
ASHLEY: 10.
MATT: 10, okay.

03:31:22.207 --> 03:31:23.257
SAM: Oh boy.

03:31:23.257 --> 03:31:24.923
MARISHA: What do I have?

03:31:24.923 --> 03:31:27.541
LAURA: They're going to cancel us.
SAM: Maybe we should just talk.

03:31:27.541 --> 03:31:29.867
TRAVIS: Give him a chance to settle up.

03:31:29.867 --> 03:31:31.047
MARISHA: Well, let's grab him first,

03:31:31.047 --> 03:31:32.515
so we have negotiating leverage.

03:31:32.515 --> 03:31:34.096
TRAVIS: And fly straight up.

03:31:34.096 --> 03:31:35.446
LAURA: He'll just cancel our Polymorph.

03:31:35.446 --> 03:31:37.557
MATT: Go ahead and just put some perspective here

03:31:37.557 --> 03:31:38.917
on where they are situated.

03:31:38.917 --> 03:31:40.267
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's good.

03:31:40.267 --> 03:31:43.147
SAM: My butt's getting sweaty.

03:31:43.147 --> 03:31:45.397
TRAVIS: Zoran on the right. Who's second from the right?

03:31:46.857 --> 03:31:51.617
MATT: So they have Zoran, Lucien, Cree,

03:31:51.617 --> 03:31:53.580
Otis, and Tyffial right there.

03:31:54.947 --> 03:31:57.367
So, you all are swooping up.
SAM: That's a hard grab.

03:31:57.367 --> 03:31:59.017
That's a hard grab.

03:31:59.017 --> 03:32:01.433
MARISHA: Of who? Which one?
SAM: All of them.

03:32:01.433 --> 03:32:03.792
LAURA: All of them. it's a hard grab.

03:32:03.792 --> 03:32:05.867
SAM: Lucien can swipe out.

03:32:05.867 --> 03:32:07.817
They've got Cree there,

03:32:07.817 --> 03:32:08.931
They can pounce on us.

03:32:08.931 --> 03:32:09.764
ASHLEY: Yep.

03:32:12.577 --> 03:32:17.102
MATT: So we have Fjord on Caduceus.

03:32:18.494 --> 03:32:20.877
Caduceus and Veth, you said you're on Caleb?

03:32:20.877 --> 03:32:25.514
LIAM: I mean, giant owls do have 19 hit points.
SAM: I flopped, so I'm with Beau on Yasha.

03:32:25.514 --> 03:32:26.597
MATT: Gotcha.

03:32:26.597 --> 03:32:29.207
TALIESIN: How many of them are there?
LAURA: We should've turned ourselves into dragons.

03:32:29.207 --> 03:32:30.447
ASHLEY: Four.

03:32:30.447 --> 03:32:31.972
LIAM: Going to hit them out of the air like a piñata,

03:32:31.972 --> 03:32:33.457
just (explosion).

03:32:33.457 --> 03:32:35.707
SAM: As we get closer, I'm going to cast Mage Hand.

03:32:36.547 --> 03:32:39.047
MATT: Okay.
SAM: Just to have it up.

03:32:39.047 --> 03:32:40.627
LAURA: Wait, I thought.

03:32:40.627 --> 03:32:44.277
This is just going to go so great!
MARISHA: Can I ready--

03:32:44.277 --> 03:32:45.110
Who am I on?

03:32:45.110 --> 03:32:47.027
I'm on Yasha?
LAURA: You're on Yasha.

03:32:47.027 --> 03:32:47.860
Yeah, you are.

03:32:47.860 --> 03:32:49.487
MARISHA: Who are you grabbing?

03:32:49.487 --> 03:32:52.647
TRAVIS: I am also going to cast See Invisibility for an hour

03:32:52.647 --> 03:32:54.897
just 'cause who fucking knows?

03:32:54.897 --> 03:32:56.757
MATT: Okay, you got it.

03:32:56.757 --> 03:33:01.357
MARISHA: I'm going to just pull out my staff and ready it,

03:33:01.357 --> 03:33:04.337
so I can do some--
LAURA: Cool monk shit?

03:33:04.337 --> 03:33:06.157
MARISHA: Yeah.
(laughter)

03:33:06.157 --> 03:33:07.407
Yeah.

03:33:07.407 --> 03:33:09.467
Beat some heads from the air.

03:33:09.467 --> 03:33:10.300
MATT: Okay.

03:33:11.847 --> 03:33:13.697
TALIESIN: I'm readying a spell.
MARISHA: Joust.

03:33:13.697 --> 03:33:15.287
MATT: What are you readying?
TALIESIN: Command.

03:33:15.287 --> 03:33:16.547
LIAM: Oh, we should've been ostriches.

03:33:16.547 --> 03:33:17.771
MARISHA: You should have been ostriches.

03:33:17.771 --> 03:33:19.047
(laughter)

03:33:19.047 --> 03:33:20.918
I can have my joust moment.

03:33:20.918 --> 03:33:23.557
TRAVIS: Velociraptors.
(laughter)

03:33:23.557 --> 03:33:24.747
MATT: Perfect.

03:33:24.747 --> 03:33:25.890
Okay, you're holding Command?

03:33:25.890 --> 03:33:26.800
LIAM: Yasha's got a lance.

03:33:26.800 --> 03:33:28.642
MATT: For what?
MARISHA: Yeah. Fuck!

03:33:28.642 --> 03:33:31.517
TALIESIN: I'm going to go for Sleep.

03:33:31.517 --> 03:33:33.300
MATT: You're going for... Oh, to.

03:33:33.300 --> 03:33:34.575
TALIESIN: Can you do that, or no?

03:33:34.575 --> 03:33:35.677
MATT: Sleep is its own spell.

03:33:35.677 --> 03:33:36.727
TALIESIN: Oh, never mind then.

03:33:37.687 --> 03:33:41.007
MARISHA: It's its own thing.
LAURA: Halt, Prone.

03:33:41.007 --> 03:33:43.507
TALIESIN: Freeze, I'm going to go for Freeze.

03:33:43.507 --> 03:33:45.604
MATT: Okay, all right.

03:33:45.604 --> 03:33:46.447
Who's your target?

03:33:46.447 --> 03:33:47.667
TALIESIN: All of them.

03:33:47.667 --> 03:33:49.197
MATT: Oh yeah, high enough level.
LAURA: Ooh.

03:33:49.197 --> 03:33:50.030
MATT: Okay.

03:33:50.957 --> 03:33:52.817
All right, so you're doing that.

03:33:52.817 --> 03:33:54.407
You got your staff ready.

03:33:54.407 --> 03:33:56.797
You are casting See Invisibility right now.

03:33:56.797 --> 03:33:57.857
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.
LAURA: Otis is carrying it.

03:33:57.857 --> 03:33:59.749
SAM: Yeah.
MATT: Yasha, are you doing anything?

03:34:00.877 --> 03:34:04.817
ASHLEY: I am an owl, so I won't take anything out.

03:34:04.817 --> 03:34:06.241
MATT: Oh, fair enough. That's right.
ASHLEY: (laughs) I forgot.

03:34:06.241 --> 03:34:07.447
I was like, "I'm going to ready."

03:34:07.447 --> 03:34:08.717
I'm not going to do anything.
MATT: Veth has Mage Hand.

03:34:08.717 --> 03:34:11.127
MARISHA: Any type of swoops you
want to do, and I can (clicks).

03:34:11.127 --> 03:34:12.707
ASHLEY: Great.

03:34:12.707 --> 03:34:13.844
MARISHA: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:34:13.844 --> 03:34:15.117
MATT: All right.

03:34:15.117 --> 03:34:17.227
Veth, there is your Mage Hand.

03:34:17.227 --> 03:34:19.527
SAM: And from past experience,

03:34:19.527 --> 03:34:23.790
that backpack, the bag of holding, how heavy is it?

03:34:24.627 --> 03:34:25.467
Is it something a Mage Hand--

03:34:25.467 --> 03:34:27.057
MATT: The bag of holding is maybe like--

03:34:27.057 --> 03:34:29.020
SAM: Or, would the backpack that Otis has.

03:34:31.277 --> 03:34:32.977
MATT: You're referring to the big thing that Zoran has?

03:34:32.977 --> 03:34:34.107
LAURA: I'm going for the Zoran bag.

03:34:34.107 --> 03:34:36.037
SAM: No, the thing that Fjord lost.

03:34:36.037 --> 03:34:37.687
MATT: Oh, that is like a small satchel.

03:34:37.687 --> 03:34:38.520
It weighs--

03:34:38.520 --> 03:34:39.357
SAM: Oh, it wasn't our bag of holding, right?

03:34:39.357 --> 03:34:40.330
MATT: It was the bag of holding.

03:34:40.330 --> 03:34:41.663
SAM: It was, okay.
MATT: Bag of holding,

03:34:41.663 --> 03:34:44.297
it's a little--
SAM: How heavy is it?

03:34:44.297 --> 03:34:46.140
Or could a Mage Hand pick it up?

03:34:47.375 --> 03:34:48.767
MATT: That, a Mage Hand could probably pick up, yeah.

03:34:48.767 --> 03:34:50.247
SAM: Okay.

03:34:50.247 --> 03:34:51.080
Just good to know.

03:34:51.080 --> 03:34:52.676
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:34:52.676 --> 03:34:53.509
MATT: Okay.

03:34:55.347 --> 03:34:59.605
So you guys (whooshing)

03:34:59.605 --> 03:35:02.036
begin to swoop in.

03:35:02.036 --> 03:35:03.857
LAURA: (whooshing) All this planning.

03:35:03.857 --> 03:35:05.717
MATT: Are you guys all coming in at this direction at once,

03:35:05.717 --> 03:35:09.630
like in a giant squadron swoop line?

03:35:09.630 --> 03:35:10.937
LAURA: No.

03:35:10.937 --> 03:35:13.337
I'm going to veer off to the side

03:35:13.337 --> 03:35:16.297
and try to swoop in, but I'm on the other side

03:35:16.297 --> 03:35:17.427
because I'm going after Zoran,

03:35:17.427 --> 03:35:19.967
so I'm going to try to fly out wide and then swoop in.

03:35:19.967 --> 03:35:20.897
LIAM: If you stagger it though,

03:35:20.897 --> 03:35:23.287
the first will tip off before the other two hit.

03:35:23.287 --> 03:35:24.847
MARISHA: Got to be all at once,

03:35:24.847 --> 03:35:26.957
but I'm down for a three-pronged approach.

03:35:26.957 --> 03:35:27.790
LAURA: Okay.

03:35:27.790 --> 03:35:29.859
LIAM: Yeah, if--

03:35:29.859 --> 03:35:31.807
SAM: I'm going to hold a Mage Hand grab

03:35:31.807 --> 03:35:34.717
if we miss on the swoop.

03:35:34.717 --> 03:35:35.550
MATT: Okay.

03:35:36.737 --> 03:35:41.737
So you're going for Zoran this way.

03:35:42.487 --> 03:35:44.375
You are going for--

03:35:44.375 --> 03:35:47.247
SAM: Yasha, are you down to--
ASHLEY: Oh, yeah.

03:35:47.247 --> 03:35:48.147
SAM: Who's going for Otis?

03:35:48.147 --> 03:35:50.177
You are?
LIAM: I'm going to grab Otis,

03:35:50.177 --> 03:35:51.457
his whole person.

03:35:51.457 --> 03:35:53.467
TRAVIS: And you're dead middle, right?

03:35:53.467 --> 03:35:55.887
SAM: And you're going for Zoran.

03:35:55.887 --> 03:35:58.977
So we're just following up in the rear?

03:35:58.977 --> 03:36:00.537
Are we the second wave?

03:36:00.537 --> 03:36:01.507
LIAM: Don't be a second wave.

03:36:01.507 --> 03:36:02.567
If there's a first wave,

03:36:02.567 --> 03:36:03.767
then they'll go, "What?"

03:36:03.767 --> 03:36:04.767
and see the second wave.

03:36:04.767 --> 03:36:08.000
SAM: Sure, but we can't both go for Otis at the same time.

03:36:08.000 --> 03:36:08.833
We'll not make--
TRAVIS: There could be a second one,

03:36:08.833 --> 03:36:11.537
though, if they succeed on dexterity, right?

03:36:11.537 --> 03:36:12.798
First could miss, second could be successful.

03:36:12.798 --> 03:36:14.464
LAURA: Yeah, that's true.
SAM: Let's go for Otis.

03:36:14.464 --> 03:36:16.547
LAURA: Go in second.
SAM: We'll go for Otis second.

03:36:16.547 --> 03:36:17.937
MARISHA: Okay, yeah.

03:36:17.937 --> 03:36:19.860
MATT: Okay, so two for Otis.

03:36:20.877 --> 03:36:21.710
Okay.

03:36:23.057 --> 03:36:24.477
You all begin to dive in

03:36:24.477 --> 03:36:27.497
and as they're walking, Lucien stops.

03:36:27.497 --> 03:36:28.330
SAM: Oh no.

03:36:29.917 --> 03:36:33.827
MATT: Turns around--
TALIESIN: Are we within 30 feet?

03:36:33.827 --> 03:36:35.967
MATT: You would be now within 30 feet, yes.

03:36:35.967 --> 03:36:37.037
TALIESIN: Freeze.

03:36:37.037 --> 03:36:38.587
MATT: All right.

03:36:38.587 --> 03:36:40.077
MARISHA: Come on.
TALIESIN: All four of them.

03:36:40.077 --> 03:36:40.910
ASHLEY: Come on, come on, come on, come on.

03:36:40.910 --> 03:36:42.867
SAM: You can do that?
ASHLEY: Five, sorry.

03:36:42.867 --> 03:36:43.700
TALIESIN: Oh, there's five of them?

03:36:43.700 --> 03:36:45.297
TALIESIN: No, four.

03:36:45.297 --> 03:36:46.130
LAURA: Yeah, there's five.

03:36:46.130 --> 03:36:47.637
LIAM: Yeah, one's teeny.

03:36:47.637 --> 03:36:49.057
TALIESIN: Thank you.

03:36:49.057 --> 03:36:50.327
MATT: What's the-- is it a wisdom save?

03:36:50.327 --> 03:36:51.420
TALIESIN: Wisdom save 18.

03:36:52.407 --> 03:36:56.187
MATT: Tyffial is frozen, or at least stops in place.

03:36:56.187 --> 03:36:58.817
I'm going to mark these here with these.

03:36:58.817 --> 03:37:00.267
TALIESIN: Freeze implies don't move.

03:37:00.267 --> 03:37:02.257
MATT: Yeah, they just hold in place.

03:37:02.257 --> 03:37:03.787
Just--
SAM: They suddenly get cold.

03:37:03.787 --> 03:37:06.978
MATT: Yeah. Now they do.
(laughter)

03:37:06.978 --> 03:37:10.067
Tyffial, (grunts) stops in place there.

03:37:10.067 --> 03:37:10.900
Otis.

03:37:14.007 --> 03:37:15.264
SAM: Oh boy.

03:37:15.264 --> 03:37:17.186
Oh boy.
MATT: Fails.

03:37:17.186 --> 03:37:18.019
MARISHA: Yes.

03:37:18.019 --> 03:37:19.685
Yes! Otis Fails!
SAM: Otis fails?

03:37:19.685 --> 03:37:21.050
Otis sucks.

03:37:21.957 --> 03:37:23.677
MARISHA: If they get him--
LIAM: Lesser halfling.

03:37:23.677 --> 03:37:25.193
MARISHA: I say--
MATT: Lucien succeeds.

03:37:25.193 --> 03:37:27.869
MARISHA: We go mailbox batting.

03:37:27.869 --> 03:37:29.620
MATT: Cree succeeds.
ASHLEY: Hell yeah.

03:37:29.620 --> 03:37:30.645
TRAVIS: Cree succeeds.

03:37:30.645 --> 03:37:32.958
ASHLEY: You get in the feathers and I'll go.

03:37:32.958 --> 03:37:35.487
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

03:37:35.487 --> 03:37:36.877
MATT: Zoran succeeds.

03:37:36.877 --> 03:37:38.017
TALIESIN: Got two of them.

03:37:38.017 --> 03:37:38.980
TRAVIS: Yep.
LIAM: Yeah.

03:37:40.367 --> 03:37:41.497
One of the targets.

03:37:41.497 --> 03:37:43.497
TRAVIS: Let's hope it is where we think it is.

03:37:44.401 --> 03:37:46.647
MATT: And as you're all swooping in at this point,

03:37:46.647 --> 03:37:48.027
you see that two of them freeze,

03:37:48.027 --> 03:37:52.695
Lucien looks behind and he goes (tsking).

03:37:53.787 --> 03:37:55.487
There is a (whooshes), a wave.

03:37:55.487 --> 03:37:57.287
You suddenly, your vision goes dark.

03:38:00.355 --> 03:38:02.710
Your darkvision vanishes around you.

03:38:03.577 --> 03:38:05.717
You are riding which eagle?

03:38:05.717 --> 03:38:06.707
The center one?

03:38:06.707 --> 03:38:07.540
SAM: Caleb.

03:38:07.540 --> 03:38:08.373
MATT: Caleb.

03:38:08.373 --> 03:38:09.207
TALIESIN: I'm holding on for dear life, anyway.

03:38:09.207 --> 03:38:11.507
MATT: Caleb, you are (whooshes).

03:38:11.507 --> 03:38:13.307
Now Caleb.
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

03:38:13.307 --> 03:38:14.150
MATT: And also the spell--

03:38:14.150 --> 03:38:15.877
Well no, you had the twinned spell, so you're fine.

03:38:15.877 --> 03:38:19.457
So, both of you, suddenly, traveling at full speed,

03:38:19.457 --> 03:38:21.347
you're riding on Caleb in the middle of the air

03:38:21.347 --> 03:38:23.707
going 60 feet per round,

03:38:23.707 --> 03:38:26.907
both (whooshes).
MARISHA: Okay, let's go for Otis.

03:38:26.907 --> 03:38:29.517
MATT: And tumble into the snow.
(laughter)

03:38:29.517 --> 03:38:30.350
Right there.

03:38:31.857 --> 03:38:32.937
All right.

03:38:32.937 --> 03:38:34.087
While that's happening,

03:38:35.857 --> 03:38:39.837
what are you doing, Fjord, on the side here with--

03:38:39.837 --> 03:38:42.547
LAURA: I was going in to grab Zoran's bag.

03:38:42.547 --> 03:38:43.380
MATT: All right.

03:38:43.380 --> 03:38:45.547
I need you to go ahead and make either--

03:38:45.547 --> 03:38:47.208
This would be an athletics check

03:38:47.208 --> 03:38:50.907
with the strength of the eagle.

03:38:50.907 --> 03:38:54.710
LAURA: Strength check, then?
SAM: ? Let the eagle soar ?

03:38:57.750 --> 03:38:59.630
LAURA: ? N-N-N-Nineteen ?

03:38:59.630 --> 03:39:00.463
MATT: 19.

03:39:02.037 --> 03:39:02.870
He fails.

03:39:04.567 --> 03:39:07.267
He has a high strength roll, but he rolled really low.

03:39:07.267 --> 03:39:10.117
So you swoop down, (whooshes),

03:39:10.117 --> 03:39:15.117
and (whistles) swing up, currently grabbing (grunts).

03:39:15.257 --> 03:39:16.207
And you see him release it,

03:39:16.207 --> 03:39:17.637
he doesn't have the ability to hold it back,

03:39:17.637 --> 03:39:20.077
and you're now clutching with your eagle,

03:39:20.077 --> 03:39:22.675
or the owl claws from both sides--

03:39:22.675 --> 03:39:23.508
LAURA: What do I do with it?

03:39:23.508 --> 03:39:28.502
MATT: The large, blue, faintly
glowing threshold crest stone.

03:39:30.099 --> 03:39:31.425
Swooping off this way.
MARISHA: Go, go, go, get as far,

03:39:31.425 --> 03:39:33.207
go away, go. Get going.
LAURA: I'm just going.

03:39:33.207 --> 03:39:34.187
MATT: All right, so that was your action,

03:39:34.187 --> 03:39:35.117
so you can't double move,

03:39:35.117 --> 03:39:36.627
but that's as far as you can get by swooping in

03:39:36.627 --> 03:39:38.012
and grabbing it and picking up.

03:39:38.012 --> 03:39:40.047
That's your round.

03:39:40.047 --> 03:39:41.096
MARISHA: Oh shit.
MATT: The rest of you,

03:39:41.096 --> 03:39:42.607
what are you doing?

03:39:42.607 --> 03:39:44.817
ASHLEY: We're swooping down to Otis.

03:39:44.817 --> 03:39:46.804
MATT: To Otis?
ASHLEY: Just going to--

03:39:46.804 --> 03:39:48.194
MATT: All right, you have your Mage Hand.

03:39:48.194 --> 03:39:49.420
What were we going to do?

03:39:50.427 --> 03:39:53.827
SAM: Well, you were just going to grab Otis' body, correct?

03:39:53.827 --> 03:39:54.779
Or?
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:39:54.779 --> 03:39:56.707
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:39:56.707 --> 03:39:58.187
TALIESIN: There are two of your friends in the snow,

03:39:58.187 --> 03:39:59.737
I should point out.
SAM: Yeah, I know,

03:39:59.737 --> 03:40:03.945
but I don't know, do we have enough

03:40:03.945 --> 03:40:07.627
time to change directions and change our intent?

03:40:07.627 --> 03:40:09.527
MATT: If whoever's driving can, yeah.

03:40:09.527 --> 03:40:11.787
SAM: I mean, this is a dumb eagle over here.

03:40:11.787 --> 03:40:13.847
I don't know if-- (laughs)

03:40:13.847 --> 03:40:14.680
MATT: Well, no, if you...

03:40:14.680 --> 03:40:16.897
I mean, what are you going to do?

03:40:16.897 --> 03:40:17.730
What are you going to do?

03:40:17.730 --> 03:40:19.577
SAM: You're with me, Beau.
TRAVIS: We can negotiate.

03:40:21.427 --> 03:40:23.317
SAM: We're going to continue and grab Otis.

03:40:23.317 --> 03:40:25.083
MARISHA: Grab Otis?
SAM: Grab Otis.

03:40:25.083 --> 03:40:26.432
SAM: That's the plan. Stick to the plan.

03:40:26.432 --> 03:40:29.879
MARISHA: Who's down? Caleb and Caduceus?

03:40:29.879 --> 03:40:31.407
LIAM: In a heap in the snow.

03:40:31.407 --> 03:40:32.757
SAM: Caleb's got tricks.

03:40:32.757 --> 03:40:33.607
MATT: So you guys dart--
SAM: Right?

03:40:33.607 --> 03:40:35.362
MARISHA: Do you have tricks, Caleb, or do you need me?

03:40:35.362 --> 03:40:37.784
MATT: -- (whooshes) down towards Otis.

03:40:37.784 --> 03:40:39.947
Yasha, I need you to go ahead and make a strength check

03:40:39.947 --> 03:40:42.697
using the strength of the owl.

03:40:42.697 --> 03:40:43.789
ASHLEY: Okay, what's the strength of the owl?

03:40:43.789 --> 03:40:44.807
MATT: What's the modifier for that?

03:40:44.807 --> 03:40:45.768
LAURA: It's just a plus one for the owls.

03:40:45.768 --> 03:40:48.467
MATT: Plus one. So go ahead and
roll a d20 and add a plus one.

03:40:48.467 --> 03:40:49.300
ASHLEY: Come on.

03:40:50.716 --> 03:40:52.424
Oh no.
TRAVIS: What is it?

03:40:52.424 --> 03:40:54.533
ASHLEY: It's a two.

03:40:54.533 --> 03:40:56.987
So a total of three.

03:40:56.987 --> 03:40:59.047
MATT: You swoop down, as your claws reach out,

03:40:59.047 --> 03:41:01.647
Otis just (whooshes) vanishes into the snow.

03:41:01.647 --> 03:41:02.950
LAURA: But Otis is frozen.

03:41:03.787 --> 03:41:04.767
MARISHA: Yeah, he had Freeze on him.

03:41:04.767 --> 03:41:06.444
MATT: Oh, that's true, actually.

03:41:06.444 --> 03:41:08.547
TRAVIS: (gasps)

03:41:08.547 --> 03:41:10.617
MARISHA: Can he make a--?

03:41:10.617 --> 03:41:13.707
MATT: Well, "Freeze" was just a stop in place.

03:41:13.707 --> 03:41:15.637
TALIESIN: Six seconds.
MATT: Correct.

03:41:15.637 --> 03:41:18.067
The equivalent of--
LIAM: That's one round of combat,

03:41:18.067 --> 03:41:19.037
which we haven't finished yet.

03:41:19.037 --> 03:41:20.817
MATT: Yeah, the Halt.

03:41:20.817 --> 03:41:23.087
ASHLEY: So do I get advantage, or something?
MATT: Yeah, so it's the equivalent of a Halt.

03:41:23.087 --> 03:41:23.920
So yeah.

03:41:23.920 --> 03:41:26.657
So he just stays there, even with that low roll,

03:41:26.657 --> 03:41:28.177
because of the command, you pick him up.

03:41:28.177 --> 03:41:30.535
(sighing)
ASHLEY: Thank god.

03:41:30.535 --> 03:41:32.987
SAM: And then as soon as we grab him.

03:41:32.987 --> 03:41:36.727
I'm going to have that Mage Hand

03:41:36.727 --> 03:41:38.277
try to pull the bag off of him.

03:41:39.667 --> 03:41:40.500
MATT: Okay.

03:41:42.137 --> 03:41:43.842
I'll put that there, that's fine.

03:41:43.842 --> 03:41:47.110
It's having a hard time staying on.

03:41:47.110 --> 03:41:49.240
So the Mage Hand goes to pull the bag.

03:41:50.487 --> 03:41:51.937
Bag's not on him.
SAM: Damn it!

03:41:53.787 --> 03:41:56.023
And the Mage Hand will just give him a wet willy.

03:41:56.023 --> 03:41:59.727
LAURA: Of course Lucien has the bag.
MATT: (as Otis) (groaning)

03:41:59.727 --> 03:42:04.327
MATT: All right. So that's your go.

03:42:07.010 --> 03:42:09.010
SAM: (nervous laugh)

03:42:09.010 --> 03:42:11.867
TALIESIN: I think they're frozen till after my turn.

03:42:11.867 --> 03:42:13.082
MATT: Correct, but we're just keeping that in mind.

03:42:13.082 --> 03:42:14.349
TRAVIS: -- that he doesn't have the bag.

03:42:15.402 --> 03:42:17.338
SAM: We don't have the bag!

03:42:18.630 --> 03:42:22.237
MARISHA: Upon hearing that, I jump off of the eagle.

03:42:22.237 --> 03:42:23.647
I'm going to do a back flip,

03:42:23.647 --> 03:42:26.727
three-point landing off of the eagle,

03:42:26.727 --> 03:42:28.217
right in between...

03:42:31.417 --> 03:42:32.797
Right in between Cree

03:42:32.797 --> 03:42:36.797
and Zor, Zor,

03:42:36.797 --> 03:42:38.730
Zor man.
LAURA: Zoran?

03:42:38.730 --> 03:42:40.090
SAM: Zorgon!

03:42:40.090 --> 03:42:42.057
LAURA: Xhorhaus man.
TRAVIS: Zoran.

03:42:42.057 --> 03:42:45.847
SAM: I am Zorgon of Blackgerd.

03:42:45.847 --> 03:42:48.277
MATT: So you're going to land right here, in front Zoran?

03:42:48.277 --> 03:42:50.277
MARISHA: In between Zoran and Cree, if I could.

03:42:52.367 --> 03:42:54.097
MATT: Roll an acrobatics check

03:42:54.097 --> 03:42:57.137
to try and kick off and make the landing.

03:42:57.137 --> 03:42:58.268
MARISHA: Natural 20.

03:42:58.268 --> 03:43:00.807
(cheering)

03:43:00.807 --> 03:43:01.817
MATT: Right there between the two of them.

03:43:01.817 --> 03:43:03.027
LIAM: Monk shit.
MARISHA: Great.

03:43:03.027 --> 03:43:04.257
ASHLEY: Monk shit.

03:43:04.257 --> 03:43:06.007
MARISHA: Can I do anything else?

03:43:06.007 --> 03:43:07.924
MATT: Yeah, it's your land. What are you going to do?

03:43:09.267 --> 03:43:11.327
MARISHA: I'm going to turn around
and crack Cree in the face.

03:43:11.327 --> 03:43:12.747
TRAVIS: Wow.

03:43:12.747 --> 03:43:14.364
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: Ratchet it up a bit,

03:43:14.364 --> 03:43:15.897
Beauregard in character.

03:43:15.897 --> 03:43:17.947
MATT: Now, before you roll your attack,

03:43:17.947 --> 03:43:19.027
before you roll your attack.

03:43:19.027 --> 03:43:19.907
MARISHA: Uh-huh?

03:43:19.907 --> 03:43:21.586
ASHLEY: Dang it, I pulled the ribbon off.

03:43:21.586 --> 03:43:22.419
(laughter)

03:43:22.419 --> 03:43:24.970
I was so stressed, I'm like, twirling.

03:43:26.087 --> 03:43:30.207
MATT: Lucien's going to use
Blood Curse of the Eyeless on you.

03:43:30.207 --> 03:43:32.757
TRAVIS: Blood Curse of the--
TALIESIN: Two of those in one round?

03:43:33.937 --> 03:43:35.387
SAM: Legendary.

03:43:35.387 --> 03:43:36.627
MATT: One of them was an action,

03:43:36.627 --> 03:43:41.037
or him turning and doing a thing, not frozen in place.

03:43:41.037 --> 03:43:42.367
TALIESIN: Yeah, man.

03:43:42.367 --> 03:43:43.467
MATT: You guys weren't stealthy.

03:43:43.467 --> 03:43:46.857
They saw you coming and you swooped in.

03:43:46.857 --> 03:43:48.297
So he takes a little bit of damage on that,

03:43:48.297 --> 03:43:50.297
but all of your attacks are at disadvantage.

03:43:51.507 --> 03:43:52.340
MARISHA: Okay.

03:43:53.187 --> 03:43:54.963
TRAVIS: Remember, we can talk.

03:43:54.963 --> 03:43:55.796
We can talk.

03:43:55.796 --> 03:43:57.327
SAM: Yeah, well, we could.

03:43:57.327 --> 03:43:59.747
TRAVIS: We have a big bag of something now.

03:43:59.747 --> 03:44:03.119
MARISHA: We can, whenever anyone who talks starts talking.

03:44:03.119 --> 03:44:05.107
(laughter)

03:44:05.107 --> 03:44:05.940
ASHLEY: Until then.

03:44:05.940 --> 03:44:08.147
MARISHA: Until then, I'ma pop pop.

03:44:08.147 --> 03:44:09.217
Pop.

03:44:09.217 --> 03:44:10.457
Oh my god.

03:44:10.457 --> 03:44:12.677
One of those is another natural 20,

03:44:12.677 --> 03:44:16.487
but I rolled at disadvantage, which is still a natural 15,

03:44:16.487 --> 03:44:20.647
for, and this is my quarterstaff, so 27.

03:44:20.647 --> 03:44:23.406
MATT: 27, okay. That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

03:44:28.427 --> 03:44:29.667
MARISHA: That's good.

03:44:29.667 --> 03:44:30.990
14 damage.

03:44:32.037 --> 03:44:33.120
Stunning Strike.

03:44:34.163 --> 03:44:35.613
MATT: 14 damage, Stunning Strike.

03:44:38.547 --> 03:44:39.917
That is going to be a 12.

03:44:39.917 --> 03:44:41.512
So Cree fails.
MARISHA: Fails.

03:44:41.512 --> 03:44:42.803
She is stunned.

03:44:44.837 --> 03:44:46.797
I'm going to turn around now with my second attack

03:44:46.797 --> 03:44:51.797
and crack Zordsbjor.

03:44:52.427 --> 03:44:54.067
SAM: I am Zordge.
MATT: Disadvantage.

03:44:54.067 --> 03:44:57.035
MARISHA: Also a 27, I rolled a 17 and a 15.

03:44:57.035 --> 03:44:57.868
MATT: Okay.

03:44:57.868 --> 03:45:00.536
LIAM: Can Beau see anything? We're in pitch dark, right?

03:45:00.874 --> 03:45:02.054
MATT: Yes, you're in pitch dark.

03:45:02.054 --> 03:45:03.444
MARISHA: I'm rolling at disadvantage.

03:45:03.444 --> 03:45:05.097
LIAM: Yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

03:45:06.134 --> 03:45:07.504
That is 13 damage.

03:45:07.504 --> 03:45:08.669
LIAM: Because I was thinking about

03:45:08.669 --> 03:45:10.297
what the hell I want to do.
MARISHA: Stunning Strike.

03:45:12.374 --> 03:45:14.104
MATT: That is a 21.

03:45:14.104 --> 03:45:16.394
MARISHA: He saves.
MATT: Mm-hmm.

03:45:16.394 --> 03:45:17.719
MARISHA: Do I have--

03:45:17.719 --> 03:45:19.214
Who is that right directly in front of me?

03:45:19.214 --> 03:45:21.034
Is that Lucien?

03:45:21.034 --> 03:45:23.849
MATT: Yeah, there's Zoran, Cree, Lucien.

03:45:26.264 --> 03:45:27.814
You're five feet away from him, or like, sorry,

03:45:27.814 --> 03:45:30.638
10 feet away, so you'd have to move in if you wanted to.

03:45:30.638 --> 03:45:32.254
MARISHA: Do I still have move?

03:45:32.254 --> 03:45:34.216
MATT: Yeah.

03:45:34.216 --> 03:45:35.133
LAURA: Do it!

03:45:36.114 --> 03:45:37.314
MARISHA: I'll move in.
MATT: Okay.

03:45:40.234 --> 03:45:41.844
All righty.

03:45:41.844 --> 03:45:43.927
MARISHA: Flurry of Blows. See if I can stun him.

03:45:47.131 --> 03:45:49.184
That's not great.

03:45:49.184 --> 03:45:52.137
That is a 20--

03:45:53.704 --> 03:45:57.166
hang on, 14 plus 12.

03:45:57.166 --> 03:45:59.027
Oh, that's still 26.

03:45:59.027 --> 03:46:00.574
Disadvantage.

03:46:00.574 --> 03:46:01.604
MATT: Then that hits.
MARISHA: Okay.

03:46:01.604 --> 03:46:02.437
ASHLEY: Wow!

03:46:04.549 --> 03:46:07.367
MARISHA: Oh, come on.
LAURA: "That's not great. 26?

03:46:07.367 --> 03:46:09.014
"Does that hit?"

03:46:09.014 --> 03:46:10.814
MARISHA: Da da da da da da, okay--

03:46:10.814 --> 03:46:12.874
LAURA: You're an ancient dragon.

03:46:12.874 --> 03:46:14.776
MARISHA: 13 damage on the first.

03:46:14.776 --> 03:46:17.037
MATT: All righty.
MARISHA: Stunning Strike.

03:46:19.594 --> 03:46:21.424
He's probably got crazy constitution.

03:46:21.424 --> 03:46:23.864
MATT: Okay. No effect.

03:46:23.864 --> 03:46:24.697
MARISHA: Second one.

03:46:27.534 --> 03:46:30.150
27, another 15.
MATT: Damn!

03:46:31.740 --> 03:46:34.524
You guys are rolling real good this session.

03:46:34.524 --> 03:46:35.924
TRAVIS: It's wild.
MATT: That needs to stop.

03:46:35.924 --> 03:46:38.763
MARISHA: 11 points of damage.

03:46:38.763 --> 03:46:39.994
MATT: 11 points of damage, all righty.

03:46:39.994 --> 03:46:41.827
MARISHA: Stunning Strike.
MATT: Stunning Strike.

03:46:42.734 --> 03:46:45.224
No effect. You do Extract Aspects.

03:46:45.224 --> 03:46:47.154
MARISHA: I do.

03:46:47.154 --> 03:46:50.966
MATT: He has resistance to fire and necrotic damage.

03:46:50.966 --> 03:46:52.394
MARISHA: Fire.

03:46:52.394 --> 03:46:54.087
MATT: Immunity to psychic damage.

03:46:55.114 --> 03:46:57.405
MARISHA: Okay, hang on, that's resistance.

03:46:57.405 --> 03:46:59.288
Okay, fire and necrotic,

03:46:59.288 --> 03:47:01.452
and then immunity to psychic?

03:47:01.452 --> 03:47:02.285
MATT: Mm-hmm.

03:47:03.224 --> 03:47:07.865
And is immune to being charmed, frightened,

03:47:07.865 --> 03:47:08.784
or stunned.

03:47:08.784 --> 03:47:10.164
TRAVIS: Wow.

03:47:10.164 --> 03:47:12.637
MARISHA: Frightened or stunned.

03:47:13.634 --> 03:47:14.467
TRAVIS: That's good to know.

03:47:14.467 --> 03:47:17.442
MARISHA: Matt built this baddie--

03:47:17.442 --> 03:47:19.791
SAM: ? He built this baddie ?
MARISHA: -- with a monk.

03:47:21.253 --> 03:47:26.253
LIAM: ? For Beauregard ?
SAM: ? (harmonizing)

03:47:27.944 --> 03:47:28.777
MARISHA: Okay.

03:47:31.124 --> 03:47:35.694
So I, yeah, pop the two of them, come through,

03:47:35.694 --> 03:47:39.414
do a nice big like cross and a haymaker,

03:47:39.414 --> 03:47:41.264
I'm assuming he shrugs it off.

03:47:41.264 --> 03:47:44.773
MATT: Yep. Just like, (impacts)

03:47:44.773 --> 03:47:45.873
MARISHA: And then I just say:

03:47:47.704 --> 03:47:49.542
Were your beds not comfy enough?

03:47:49.542 --> 03:47:51.832
LAURA: (chuckles)

03:47:51.832 --> 03:47:55.249
MATT: He just gives you a tightened glare.

03:47:57.044 --> 03:47:57.877
All right.

03:47:59.904 --> 03:48:01.484
At this instance, we have to roll initiative.

03:48:01.484 --> 03:48:04.054
We've had the pseudo, not really a surprise round,

03:48:04.054 --> 03:48:05.469
reactionary round.
LIAM: Right.

03:48:05.469 --> 03:48:06.844
MATT: We do need initiative on this.

03:48:08.055 --> 03:48:10.419
SAM: ? (singing notes) ?

03:48:10.419 --> 03:48:13.794
MARISHA: Ooh! That's bad, I'm going to use my boots.

03:48:13.794 --> 03:48:15.214
LIAM: Rolled a one.
SAM: I did, too.

03:48:15.214 --> 03:48:16.094
LIAM: See ya later.

03:48:16.094 --> 03:48:18.368
MARISHA: I also rolled a one.
SAM: I did, too.

03:48:18.368 --> 03:48:19.724
Guys, we got three ones.

03:48:19.724 --> 03:48:21.487
LIAM: In fact, I'm going to the restroom.

03:48:21.487 --> 03:48:22.320
SAM: Uh-huh.

03:48:24.718 --> 03:48:28.014
? (sings with background music) ?

03:48:28.014 --> 03:48:30.097
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

03:48:32.124 --> 03:48:33.124
LAURA: Oh my god.

03:48:37.280 --> 03:48:38.944
MATT: Okay.

03:48:38.944 --> 03:48:40.819
So 25 to 20.

03:48:40.819 --> 03:48:41.777
TALIESIN: 21.

03:48:43.313 --> 03:48:44.146
MARISHA: Cad!

03:48:45.384 --> 03:48:47.047
TALIESIN: I got nothing, so.

03:48:47.047 --> 03:48:48.754
MATT: 20 to 15.

03:48:50.704 --> 03:48:52.217
LAURA: 17.
TRAVIS: 16.

03:48:53.584 --> 03:48:55.087
MATT: All right.

03:48:55.924 --> 03:48:58.957
What's your dexterity modifier, Caduceus?

03:49:00.154 --> 03:49:02.334
TALIESIN: My dex? Two.

03:49:02.334 --> 03:49:03.674
MATT: Got it, all right, cool.

03:49:03.674 --> 03:49:04.923
So what was it again?

03:49:04.923 --> 03:49:07.132
LAURA: 17.
MATT: 17, Jester. All righty.

03:49:07.132 --> 03:49:08.132
TRAVIS: And Fjord with 16.

03:49:10.784 --> 03:49:13.597
MATT: All right. 15 to 10?

03:49:15.830 --> 03:49:17.224
TRAVIS: Wow.
MATT: 10 to five.

03:49:17.224 --> 03:49:19.544
MARISHA: Nine.
ASHLEY: Eight.

03:49:19.544 --> 03:49:21.027
SAM: Six.

03:49:22.684 --> 03:49:24.394
MATT: On nine was Yasha?

03:49:24.394 --> 03:49:26.851
ASHLEY: I'm sorry, I'm 10.
MATT: Okay.

03:49:26.851 --> 03:49:28.246
TRAVIS: So Yasha, Beau.
MARISHA: Yasha, Beau.

03:49:28.246 --> 03:49:29.989
TRAVIS: Veth?
MARISHA: Veth.

03:49:29.989 --> 03:49:31.226
ASHLEY: I don't know why I just said eight, though.

03:49:31.226 --> 03:49:32.514
MATT: Beau, what were you? You were eight?

03:49:32.514 --> 03:49:34.654
MARISHA: Nine.
MATT: So you were nine.

03:49:34.654 --> 03:49:36.194
And then what were you, Veth?

03:49:36.194 --> 03:49:39.374
SAM: Six, and then Caleb's at the end with, like, four

03:49:39.374 --> 03:49:40.274
or something like that.

03:49:40.274 --> 03:49:41.757
MARISHA: He rolled a one.
SAM: Yeah.

03:49:42.624 --> 03:49:43.457
MATT: Okay.

03:49:48.659 --> 03:49:50.429
So Caleb is at the end, got you.

03:49:50.429 --> 03:49:51.262
LAURA: Fuck.

03:49:53.004 --> 03:49:54.864
MATT: All right.

03:49:54.864 --> 03:49:57.664
MARISHA: (Southern accent)
I hope someone can talk real purty.

03:49:58.604 --> 03:49:59.870
LAURA: (laughs)

03:49:59.870 --> 03:50:01.870
MATT: Lucien's up first.
MARISHA: After you punched three of them!

03:50:01.870 --> 03:50:03.603
TRAVIS: Lucien's up first.

03:50:04.926 --> 03:50:07.267
ASHLEY: ? (imitates background music) ?

03:50:07.267 --> 03:50:09.407
LAURA: Fix this!
MATT: Lucien, with that glare.

03:50:14.554 --> 03:50:16.414
I think a 30 hits you.

03:50:16.414 --> 03:50:18.374
Make a constitution saving throw for me.

03:50:18.374 --> 03:50:19.727
TRAVIS: 30. Shit.

03:50:20.961 --> 03:50:22.824
MARISHA: This is probably going to be really bad.

03:50:22.824 --> 03:50:23.657
Uh-oh.

03:50:24.924 --> 03:50:26.634
Uh-oh.
MATT: Mm-hmm?

03:50:26.634 --> 03:50:27.467
MARISHA: 10 total.

03:50:29.724 --> 03:50:31.084
MATT: As you all swoop around and gather,

03:50:31.084 --> 03:50:33.834
those who are nearby and can see, you watch as Lucien,

03:50:33.834 --> 03:50:36.524
after grinning with a glare,

03:50:36.524 --> 03:50:38.234
reaches out and grabs Beauregard

03:50:38.234 --> 03:50:41.134
by the throat and lifts her an inch or two off the ground.

03:50:43.104 --> 03:50:43.937
SAM: Oh boy.

03:50:43.937 --> 03:50:45.774
MARISHA: You watch as blood begins to pour from her eyes,

03:50:45.774 --> 03:50:48.364
her mouth, her ears, her nose.

03:50:48.364 --> 03:50:50.064
Your brain is filled with a searing pain

03:50:50.064 --> 03:50:52.147
you have never experienced in your life.

03:50:53.985 --> 03:50:54.818
SAM: Oh boy.

03:50:56.414 --> 03:50:57.287
That's not good.

03:50:58.754 --> 03:51:01.402
That's like an insta-death thing or something.

03:51:01.402 --> 03:51:02.452
TRAVIS: It's not great.

03:51:03.494 --> 03:51:06.217
ASHLEY: Better not be. I'll kill him.

03:51:07.984 --> 03:51:11.674
SAM: Oh man. That'd be weirdly poetic.

03:51:11.674 --> 03:51:13.334
LIAM: Kill your friend for your friend.

03:51:13.334 --> 03:51:14.167
TRAVIS: Lot of adding.

03:51:15.512 --> 03:51:16.382
Still more.

03:51:17.304 --> 03:51:19.264
MATT: You take 69 points of psychic damage.

03:51:19.264 --> 03:51:20.634
SAM: Nice.
MARISHA: Nice.

03:51:20.634 --> 03:51:21.775
ASHLEY: What is it again?

03:51:21.775 --> 03:51:25.074
TRAVIS: 69 points of psychic damage.
ASHLEY: Six-nine.

03:51:27.201 --> 03:51:29.381
MATT: And he, just holding you there, goes,

03:51:29.381 --> 03:51:31.431
"Is this really how you want this to go?"

03:51:33.534 --> 03:51:35.274
And just holds her up there.

03:51:35.274 --> 03:51:37.924
Your vision is just white, searing pain right now

03:51:37.924 --> 03:51:38.784
at the moment.

03:51:38.784 --> 03:51:40.784
The other hand, he pulls the sword out

03:51:40.784 --> 03:51:43.584
and runs the back of it across his stomach

03:51:43.584 --> 03:51:46.074
where the cloak is now open, the heavy fur exposing

03:51:46.074 --> 03:51:48.784
his midsection and the loose, low-cut shirt,

03:51:48.784 --> 03:51:50.384
and as it runs the blood, you can see the blade

03:51:50.384 --> 03:51:54.004
begin to shimmer with that same weird, glowing,

03:51:54.004 --> 03:51:57.744
iridescent coloration. (swooshing)

03:51:57.744 --> 03:51:59.154
That's going to end his turn

03:52:00.094 --> 03:52:02.414
as he begins to step back a bit,

03:52:02.414 --> 03:52:04.837
pulling you with him this direction,

03:52:06.224 --> 03:52:07.724
walking.

03:52:10.654 --> 03:52:12.264
That brings us to Cree's turn.

03:52:12.264 --> 03:52:14.254
Cree is stunned, can't do anything,

03:52:14.254 --> 03:52:17.254
and just stands there like (groans).

03:52:17.254 --> 03:52:19.724
Holding her middle of her chest where she took the impacts

03:52:19.724 --> 03:52:22.736
from you and is just trying to shake it off.

03:52:22.736 --> 03:52:23.569
Caduceus.

03:52:24.638 --> 03:52:27.194
TALIESIN: Does this last more than a round?

03:52:27.194 --> 03:52:28.687
MATT: What, the--
TALIESIN: Blindness.

03:52:31.634 --> 03:52:32.684
Am I still blind or am I not blind?

03:52:32.684 --> 03:52:34.524
MATT: Sorry, you are still blind.

03:52:34.524 --> 03:52:35.834
TALIESIN: Okay.

03:52:35.834 --> 03:52:38.687
MATT: I say blind. You're in pitch darkness.

03:52:38.687 --> 03:52:40.744
You see the faint glow of the--

03:52:40.744 --> 03:52:42.464
LIAM: Doesn't Caduceus have the goggles on?

03:52:42.464 --> 03:52:43.829
MATT: He does.

03:52:43.829 --> 03:52:46.534
TRAVIS: Did he dispel the goggles? Is that what it was?

03:52:46.534 --> 03:52:47.474
MATT: The goggles aren't working.

03:52:47.474 --> 03:52:48.774
LIAM: Ah, okay.

03:52:49.784 --> 03:52:51.244
TALIESIN: So it's not that I'm...

03:52:51.244 --> 03:52:52.354
It's just that the goggles aren't working anymore?

03:52:52.354 --> 03:52:53.414
MATT: Correct, it's just dark night.

03:52:53.414 --> 03:52:56.134
So you can still see faint shapes around you

03:52:56.134 --> 03:52:59.224
now that you're on the ground and getting up

03:52:59.224 --> 03:53:00.234
or as you're looking on the ground,

03:53:00.234 --> 03:53:02.832
but you are looking normal vision

03:53:02.832 --> 03:53:04.824
in pitch black and just the faint blue glow

03:53:04.824 --> 03:53:08.834
of the threshold crest being carried off

03:53:08.834 --> 03:53:10.177
by one of the owls.

03:53:11.464 --> 03:53:13.577
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to stand up then,

03:53:14.524 --> 03:53:17.521
light the staff so there's something to see.

03:53:17.521 --> 03:53:19.087
MATT: The staff does not light.

03:53:19.991 --> 03:53:22.144
SAM: The staff does not light.
MATT: The staff does not light.

03:53:22.144 --> 03:53:25.125
TALIESIN: So it's just nothing right now? Oh, that's okay.

03:53:25.125 --> 03:53:28.154
MARISHA: Well, he popped that spell on you, didn't he?

03:53:28.154 --> 03:53:30.204
TALIESIN: Yeah, so I guess I'm out at the moment.

03:53:31.704 --> 03:53:34.104
I'm going to stand up then.
LIAM: Did he target him?

03:53:34.104 --> 03:53:35.334
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MARISHA: Yes.

03:53:35.334 --> 03:53:36.684
LIAM: Beyond hitting us?

03:53:36.684 --> 03:53:38.854
TALIESIN: I was hoping that you'd notice that we were trying

03:53:38.854 --> 03:53:41.687
to just bring back a sense of balance.

03:53:45.834 --> 03:53:50.577
That's a respectable move considering,

03:53:52.322 --> 03:53:54.437
a violation of even tenuous trust.

03:53:56.414 --> 03:53:59.167
MATT: "Trust only goes so far. We got what we wanted."

03:54:02.194 --> 03:54:03.764
That finishes your go, Caduceus.

03:54:03.764 --> 03:54:07.897
It is now Otis' turn, who is trying to kick off of you.

03:54:07.897 --> 03:54:09.473
SAM: Make a fucking move.

03:54:09.473 --> 03:54:12.463
(laughter)

03:54:12.463 --> 03:54:14.014
TALIESIN: Fuck, man.

03:54:14.014 --> 03:54:15.294
MATT: All right.

03:54:15.294 --> 03:54:18.434
Otis is going to go ahead and use a bonus action

03:54:18.434 --> 03:54:21.104
to, once again, push his thumb into the crossbow

03:54:21.104 --> 03:54:23.816
that he pulls from the side. It's this big heavy crossbow.

03:54:23.816 --> 03:54:26.124
It fills with this crackling,

03:54:26.124 --> 03:54:29.124
purple-ish, electricity-like energy

03:54:29.124 --> 03:54:32.124
arcing across the front of the crossbow,

03:54:32.124 --> 03:54:34.451
and is going to try and kick off of you.

03:54:35.859 --> 03:54:37.035
Off of you,

03:54:37.035 --> 03:54:39.964
so make an athletics.

03:54:39.964 --> 03:54:42.557
SAM: With owl stats?
MATT: To hold on with owl stats.

03:54:43.424 --> 03:54:45.334
SAM: We might need some owl stats there.

03:54:45.334 --> 03:54:46.689
LAURA: Oh, yeah, no no, what?

03:54:46.689 --> 03:54:47.544
MATT: Well, it's plus one to strength,

03:54:47.544 --> 03:54:48.494
so just roll and add a plus one.

03:54:48.494 --> 03:54:49.567
ASHLEY: Okay.
LIAM: Yep.

03:54:52.734 --> 03:54:53.567
ASHLEY: 10.

03:54:55.460 --> 03:54:57.274
MATT: Kicks off, falls back,

03:54:57.274 --> 03:54:59.634
and lands in the snow.

03:54:59.634 --> 03:55:00.474
MARISHA: Piece of shit.

03:55:00.474 --> 03:55:03.947
MATT: And is going to start darting in this way,

03:55:05.497 --> 03:55:08.724
to cluster in, crossbow at the ready,

03:55:08.724 --> 03:55:10.957
now back towards Lucien.

03:55:12.891 --> 03:55:15.722
All right, that finishes Otis' go.

03:55:15.722 --> 03:55:18.224
TRAVIS: Question, did we take a short rest?

03:55:18.224 --> 03:55:19.584
An official short rest?
LAURA: Yeah.

03:55:19.584 --> 03:55:21.174
LIAM: We did at one point, yes.

03:55:21.174 --> 03:55:23.004
LAURA: We took a short rest after the dragon fight.

03:55:23.004 --> 03:55:26.014
MATT: Correct. Not in the tower, but after the dragon fight.

03:55:26.014 --> 03:55:27.394
MARISHA: Well, imagine in the tower,

03:55:27.394 --> 03:55:30.044
there's eating and all that stuff, too.

03:55:30.044 --> 03:55:32.887
MATT: Yeah, like, you got a short rest.

03:55:34.154 --> 03:55:36.547
It is now Jester. Fjord, you're on deck.

03:55:40.874 --> 03:55:43.237
LAURA: I mean, I was just flying.
MATT: Yeah.

03:55:44.147 --> 03:55:45.984
Which direction you going?

03:55:45.984 --> 03:55:49.947
LAURA: Going to keep flying out this way.

03:55:52.928 --> 03:55:55.304
MATT: All right, you've got Fjord in tow.

03:55:55.304 --> 03:55:57.764
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: What's your max distance you can go?

03:55:57.764 --> 03:55:59.314
MATT: 60 feet, right?
LAURA: 60 feet.

03:55:59.314 --> 03:56:00.944
MATT: If you double move, you can go even further.

03:56:00.944 --> 03:56:04.574
120, or, depends on if you're trying

03:56:04.574 --> 03:56:07.304
to just make distance, or--

03:56:07.304 --> 03:56:09.069
LAURA: I'm just trying to get it at a distance right now,

03:56:09.069 --> 03:56:11.004
but I'm not going to, like, abandon our friends.

03:56:11.004 --> 03:56:12.844
TRAVIS: No, distance is good, because if they close,

03:56:12.844 --> 03:56:14.269
then we're in range.
MARISHA: Yeah, then we're fucked.

03:56:14.269 --> 03:56:16.284
TRAVIS: We can talk.

03:56:16.284 --> 03:56:17.734
MATT: So what you doing? You going 60 feet?

03:56:17.734 --> 03:56:19.777
Or you're double moving to a full 120?

03:56:21.054 --> 03:56:23.044
Your call.
LAURA: Why you nodding?

03:56:23.044 --> 03:56:25.877
There's two options there.
TRAVIS: I would say 120.

03:56:25.877 --> 03:56:27.259
LAURA: Really?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:56:28.834 --> 03:56:31.084
Calmer heads can prevail. You're real close,

03:56:31.084 --> 03:56:32.334
that's a different story.

03:56:35.924 --> 03:56:36.949
SAM: Beau's going to die.

03:56:36.949 --> 03:56:39.544
TRAVIS: We have what they need.

03:56:39.544 --> 03:56:42.105
SAM: Oh, you do, you guys do. Yeah.

03:56:42.105 --> 03:56:43.434
MARISHA: We can still try and get out of here

03:56:43.434 --> 03:56:45.484
if we feel like we want to run.

03:56:45.484 --> 03:56:46.347
SAM: You can't.

03:56:47.439 --> 03:56:50.717
ASHLEY: Well, I can try to--
LAURA: 120 feet, I guess.

03:56:50.717 --> 03:56:51.575
TALIESIN: I don't know what's wrong with me.

03:56:51.575 --> 03:56:53.816
If I can't cast, I don't know what to do.

03:56:56.204 --> 03:56:57.224
MARISHA: Maybe it'll fade.

03:56:57.224 --> 03:56:58.552
LAURA: You fully can't cast anything?

03:56:58.552 --> 03:57:03.552
TALIESIN: Nope, I tried to cast a cantrip, nothing.

03:57:03.668 --> 03:57:05.054
LAURA: Like your staff doesn't work?

03:57:05.054 --> 03:57:05.887
TALIESIN: Nope.

03:57:07.534 --> 03:57:09.201
No heal, no nothing.

03:57:16.334 --> 03:57:17.744
SAM: Who's turn?

03:57:17.744 --> 03:57:20.584
MATT: That finishes your go. Fjord, you're up.

03:57:20.584 --> 03:57:22.944
TRAVIS: I will call out--
MATT: Are you going full

03:57:22.944 --> 03:57:23.777
double distance, you said?

03:57:23.777 --> 03:57:24.924
Or you--
LAURA: Yeah.

03:57:24.924 --> 03:57:27.571
MARISHA: Okay. Even further out.

03:57:28.464 --> 03:57:29.917
60 or so feet this way.

03:57:30.924 --> 03:57:35.017
TRAVIS: I will call out: Now who's taking things from whom?

03:57:36.094 --> 03:57:38.954
I assume if you need the rest of this,

03:57:38.954 --> 03:57:41.074
we should all settle down,

03:57:41.074 --> 03:57:45.014
and discuss what our options are as we near the end

03:57:45.014 --> 03:57:47.731
of our journey, wouldn't you agree?

03:57:49.024 --> 03:57:50.794
MATT: As a retort on your turn,

03:57:50.794 --> 03:57:54.141
you hear Lucien shout through the wind and the snow,

03:57:54.141 --> 03:57:57.314
"Take it if you like; there's more where that came from.

03:57:57.314 --> 03:57:59.564
"We'll just kill your friends and take a little more time

03:57:59.564 --> 03:58:01.122
"than we anticipated."

03:58:01.122 --> 03:58:02.964
TRAVIS: Do I believe him?

03:58:02.964 --> 03:58:05.424
MATT: At this distance,
make an insight check with disadvantage

03:58:05.424 --> 03:58:08.484
because you're just going off of a voice through the wind.

03:58:08.484 --> 03:58:10.604
You have no facial expressions, no physicality--

03:58:10.604 --> 03:58:12.164
TALIESIN: Can I take an insight check on that as well,

03:58:12.164 --> 03:58:13.443
since I'm right there?
MATT: I'll let you.

03:58:13.443 --> 03:58:15.133
TALIESIN: Thank you.
TRAVIS: It's only a 10.

03:58:15.133 --> 03:58:16.894
My insight sucks.
MATT: Yeah. Too far.

03:58:16.894 --> 03:58:17.727
Too difficult.

03:58:18.694 --> 03:58:20.462
TRAVIS: I do love a good bluff.

03:58:20.462 --> 03:58:22.134
MATT: I would say disadvantage
on you, too, for the same reason

03:58:22.134 --> 03:58:24.484
because it is in pitch black for you

03:58:24.484 --> 03:58:27.384
beyond the just faint bit of light that's making it's way.

03:58:29.854 --> 03:58:31.174
TALIESIN: Damn it!

03:58:31.174 --> 03:58:32.204
19.

03:58:32.204 --> 03:58:33.454
MATT: 19's still pretty good.

03:58:34.304 --> 03:58:35.455
You don't feel like he's bluffing.

03:58:35.455 --> 03:58:36.603
TALIESIN: Fuck.

03:58:36.603 --> 03:58:38.684
ASHLEY: (sighs)

03:58:38.684 --> 03:58:40.684
TALIESIN: I'm going to definitely put up my hands and

03:58:43.104 --> 03:58:47.024
just sort of try and be nice and chill.

03:58:47.024 --> 03:58:49.334
MATT: Okay. That finishes Fjord's go.

03:58:49.334 --> 03:58:50.234
LIAM: DM.
MATT: Yes.

03:58:50.234 --> 03:58:51.067
LIAM: Where did that come from?

03:58:51.067 --> 03:58:53.404
Did that come from him not being able to cast magic?

03:58:53.404 --> 03:58:56.094
Did that come from when we got zapped out of the air?

03:58:56.094 --> 03:58:57.794
Or did I miss when I ran to the bathroom

03:58:57.794 --> 03:58:59.431
an additional thing done to Caduceus?

03:58:59.431 --> 03:59:00.694
MARISHA: I think when you went to the bathroom,

03:59:00.694 --> 03:59:02.924
we got hit with a thing.
MATT: You guys were in the air,

03:59:02.924 --> 03:59:04.244
your spell vanished, you landed.

03:59:04.244 --> 03:59:05.581
LIAM: Right.

03:59:05.581 --> 03:59:08.455
MATT: Caduceus got up and tried to cast magic, didn't work.

03:59:08.455 --> 03:59:10.474
LIAM: So it was from getting hit out of the air?

03:59:10.474 --> 03:59:11.722
MATT: It seems so.
LIAM: Seems so.

03:59:11.722 --> 03:59:13.889
MATT: Something like that. You don't know.

03:59:15.993 --> 03:59:17.429
TALIESIN: The goggles stopped working.

03:59:17.429 --> 03:59:19.484
MATT: So it is now Zoran's turn.

03:59:19.484 --> 03:59:20.725
MARISHA: Oh.

03:59:23.862 --> 03:59:27.170
LAURA: You can just take magic from somebody?

03:59:27.170 --> 03:59:29.153
MARISHA: (sighs)

03:59:34.050 --> 03:59:36.217
MATT: Zoran's going to walk over.

03:59:39.091 --> 03:59:41.324
Run his hand across the outside of the mace,

03:59:41.324 --> 03:59:42.784
like it's a matchstick,

03:59:42.784 --> 03:59:45.730
but it's just tiny little splinter blades.

03:59:45.730 --> 03:59:47.524
(swooshes) Once again, his blood scatters across the snow

03:59:47.524 --> 03:59:51.499
and across the hammer head and as it does flame ignites.

03:59:52.734 --> 03:59:54.234
LAURA: So we can see everything now?

03:59:54.234 --> 03:59:56.264
MATT: Now you can see, there's flame,

03:59:56.264 --> 03:59:58.074
a little bit of glowing firelight in the area

03:59:58.074 --> 04:00:00.261
as he swings the maul,

04:00:00.261 --> 04:00:02.215
(swooshes) right into Beau's stomach.

04:00:02.215 --> 04:00:03.798
ASHLEY: Fuck.

04:00:05.797 --> 04:00:07.397
MATT: That is going to be

04:00:12.224 --> 04:00:14.554
18 to hit.
MARISHA: Miss.

04:00:14.554 --> 04:00:18.404
MATT: For the first swing, you actually pull up your legs

04:00:18.404 --> 04:00:20.794
almost putting them on Lucien's arm

04:00:20.794 --> 04:00:22.874
and the swing goes wide.

04:00:22.874 --> 04:00:25.524
As you kick back down, he angrily follows through

04:00:25.524 --> 04:00:26.577
with an upswing.

04:00:28.414 --> 04:00:29.566
Natural 20.

04:00:29.566 --> 04:00:32.134
SAM: (sighs)
TALIESIN: I can't cancel, can I?

04:00:32.134 --> 04:00:33.671
MATT: You can try.

04:00:33.671 --> 04:00:35.004
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and cancel it.

04:00:35.004 --> 04:00:35.837
MATT: No effect.

04:00:35.837 --> 04:00:37.954
TALIESIN: Really? It's a racial trait.

04:00:37.954 --> 04:00:40.334
You can't even--
LAURA: Fuck.

04:00:40.334 --> 04:00:41.859
LIAM: Where you at, Beau?

04:00:41.859 --> 04:00:43.335
MARISHA: I'm bad.
LIAM: Okay.

04:00:43.335 --> 04:00:45.757
LAURA: He just took all your magic away?

04:00:45.757 --> 04:00:46.857
How can he do that?

04:00:46.857 --> 04:00:48.024
TALIESIN: I don't know.
ASHLEY: How did he do that?

04:00:48.024 --> 04:00:50.335
SAM: Maybe it's just for a round?

04:00:50.335 --> 04:00:52.324
MARISHA: I'm hoping it's just for a round.

04:00:52.324 --> 04:00:55.024
TALIESIN: I'm definitely going to be enough.

04:00:55.024 --> 04:00:56.424
I'm going to be calling enough.

04:00:59.154 --> 04:01:01.406
LIAM: They don't want surrender. They want victory.

04:01:01.406 --> 04:01:03.577
LAURA: Well, yeah, they don't care.
They're going to kill us.

04:01:05.404 --> 04:01:07.774
MATT: Take 18 points of bludgeoning damage, Beauregard,

04:01:07.774 --> 04:01:12.133
and five points of fire damage from the impact of the maul.

04:01:13.057 --> 04:01:15.879
MARISHA: It's 22 total?
MATT: Correct.

04:01:16.754 --> 04:01:18.541
That finishes Zoran's turn.

04:01:18.541 --> 04:01:20.269
Yasha, you're up.

04:01:23.924 --> 04:01:26.824
LAURA: You have the power to dispel--

04:01:26.824 --> 04:01:28.124
ASHLEY: I do?
LAURA: Yeah, I don't have

04:01:28.124 --> 04:01:29.341
to do that, you can do it if you want.

04:01:29.341 --> 04:01:32.654
SAM: You have the power to dodeca-heal yourself.

04:01:32.654 --> 04:01:33.517
If you believe.

04:01:36.364 --> 04:01:37.197
ASHLEY: Okay.

04:01:38.794 --> 04:01:41.987
I'm going to dispel the eagle.
SAM: Oh.

04:01:42.998 --> 04:01:45.024
We're not going to go--
ASHLEY: Are you still on me?

04:01:45.024 --> 04:01:46.874
SAM: Yeah, but I can land.

04:01:46.874 --> 04:01:49.674
I thought we were going to go back and try to get Beau.

04:01:50.584 --> 04:01:52.457
LAURA: Yeah. Oh, that, too. Yeah. Yeah.

04:01:53.564 --> 04:01:55.319
ASHLEY: Oh yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:01:55.319 --> 04:01:57.344
Okay. Okay.

04:01:57.344 --> 04:01:59.626
The stats of the owl are so low.

04:01:59.626 --> 04:02:02.174
SAM: Well then, ditch it.

04:02:02.174 --> 04:02:04.675
Whatever you want.
ASHLEY: (sighs)

04:02:04.675 --> 04:02:07.225
Fuck, I didn't realize I was next.

04:02:07.225 --> 04:02:08.058
Okay. Okay.
LIAM: People are going to take

04:02:08.058 --> 04:02:10.394
a swipe at her, when you leave,

04:02:10.394 --> 04:02:11.364
if you grab her and go.

04:02:11.364 --> 04:02:12.347
TRAVIS: Do you guys even see

04:02:12.347 --> 04:02:13.638
the pouch on Lucien?
MATT: Well, forced movement

04:02:13.638 --> 04:02:15.330
is different from chosen movement.

04:02:15.330 --> 04:02:18.054
If you force something out of a range,

04:02:18.054 --> 04:02:21.004
it doesn't necessarily trigger an opportunity attack.

04:02:21.004 --> 04:02:22.894
It's when something actively moves out.

04:02:22.894 --> 04:02:24.504
LIAM: Okay.
TRAVIS: If the bag's not on Otis,

04:02:24.504 --> 04:02:26.544
and it's not in this big-ass bag that we have--

04:02:26.544 --> 04:02:29.321
SAM: It's definitely on Lucien.
TRAVIS: We should be able to see it.

04:02:29.321 --> 04:02:31.314
MARISHA: Lucien or Cree, which is why,

04:02:31.314 --> 04:02:33.354
because Cree is feels like their bag bitch

04:02:33.354 --> 04:02:34.317
a lot of times.

04:02:35.775 --> 04:02:37.314
LIAM: (sighs)

04:02:37.314 --> 04:02:38.524
ASHLEY: Okay.
MATT: What are you doing, Yasha?

04:02:38.524 --> 04:02:41.560
ASHLEY: I'm going to--

04:02:41.560 --> 04:02:43.727
TRAVIS: I need it for something.

04:02:45.281 --> 04:02:47.481
ASHLEY: I'm going to try to swoop down and grab Beau,

04:02:49.436 --> 04:02:50.814
out of that area.

04:02:50.814 --> 04:02:51.814
MATT: Okay.

04:02:51.814 --> 04:02:54.584
MARISHA: Is there anything I can on my end to try and

04:02:55.854 --> 04:02:58.737
grab and will this to happen?

04:02:58.737 --> 04:03:01.051
SAM: Make your shoulders more--
MATT: I will say because--

04:03:01.051 --> 04:03:02.474
MARISHA: Yeah, make little loops on my arms.

04:03:02.474 --> 04:03:04.204
MATT: -- because you cannot see in the darkness,

04:03:04.204 --> 04:03:06.054
you do not see the owl in the air,

04:03:06.054 --> 04:03:08.884
and you've taken so much unexpected damage in the past round

04:03:08.884 --> 04:03:11.664
that you are semi-dazed, so I will say, unfortunately,

04:03:11.664 --> 04:03:16.664
you cannot aid in this, but anything is possible.

04:03:17.324 --> 04:03:21.534
So as you turn as you can on a dime. (swooshes)

04:03:21.534 --> 04:03:24.156
As the owl then goes into a swoop,

04:03:24.156 --> 04:03:25.239
(swoops) striking down,

04:03:25.239 --> 04:03:27.444
I need you to go ahead and make a strength check.

04:03:27.444 --> 04:03:29.094
So roll a d20 and add one.

04:03:34.634 --> 04:03:37.877
ASHLEY: 14.
SAM: (groans)

04:03:40.164 --> 04:03:41.904
MATT: Lucien rolled low. He's not super strong,

04:03:41.904 --> 04:03:45.287
if you recall Molly's physical statistics.
TALIESIN: I do remember.

04:03:45.287 --> 04:03:47.774
MATT: (swooshes) You snatch Beauregard out of Lucien's hand

04:03:47.774 --> 04:03:50.514
and as you (swooshes) pull her away,

04:03:50.514 --> 04:03:55.514
this direction, for the rest of your 60 feet to about there.

04:04:00.254 --> 04:04:01.087
MARISHA: Okay.

04:04:02.424 --> 04:04:03.814
LAURA: Now we just got to get
Caleb and Caduceus out of there.

04:04:03.814 --> 04:04:06.044
ASHLEY: There's nothing else I can do as the owl right?

04:04:06.044 --> 04:04:07.124
I can't do my--
MATT: Your action was to

04:04:07.124 --> 04:04:08.464
pull her out.
ASHLEY: Okay.

04:04:08.464 --> 04:04:11.062
LAURA: That's a great action.
MARISHA: Thank you.

04:04:11.062 --> 04:04:12.645
Thank you.

04:04:15.434 --> 04:04:16.267
MATT: Okay.

04:04:17.554 --> 04:04:19.934
That brings us to Beauregard.

04:04:19.934 --> 04:04:23.224
You are now being held, semi rag-doll--

04:04:23.224 --> 04:04:24.654
MARISHA: Oh shit.
MATT: As you recover.

04:04:24.654 --> 04:04:27.484
MARISHA: It's me. Oh god.
TRAVIS: Do you have a potion?

04:04:27.484 --> 04:04:28.634
MARISHA: Yes, I do.

04:04:28.634 --> 04:04:32.277
I will drown this that's sitting right here.

04:04:34.934 --> 04:04:37.437
It's this plus a thing, right? Plus four?

04:04:39.024 --> 04:04:42.034
MATT: Yes. 4d4 plus four.

04:04:42.034 --> 04:04:43.634
MATT: You roll the dice and then add the number of dice

04:04:43.634 --> 04:04:45.879
that are in the potion.

04:04:46.914 --> 04:04:49.661
MARISHA: Oh, is that how it is?
MATT: Yep.

04:04:49.661 --> 04:04:52.277
MARISHA: How cool.
Oh, what a nice little trick.

04:04:53.334 --> 04:04:54.844
TRAVIS: How long have we had those potion bottles?

04:04:54.844 --> 04:04:57.982
MATT: Yeah, 2d2 plus two, 4d4 plus four. 8d8 plus eight.

04:04:57.982 --> 04:04:59.664
MARISHA: Okay. Okay. That gives me something.

04:04:59.664 --> 04:05:02.974
It's not a lot, but it's something.

04:05:02.974 --> 04:05:05.324
MATT: Okay. That your turn, Beauregard?

04:05:05.324 --> 04:05:06.574
MARISHA: Can I do anything else?

04:05:07.684 --> 04:05:08.934
MATT: I mean, if you have anything else to do,

04:05:08.934 --> 04:05:10.494
while you're being held by an owl.

04:05:10.494 --> 04:05:12.474
MARISHA: That was my action.
LAURA: Could you Patient Defense

04:05:12.474 --> 04:05:14.884
in the owl's grasp?
MARISHA: I guess I could.

04:05:14.884 --> 04:05:16.184
Could I do that?

04:05:16.184 --> 04:05:18.224
MATT: If you use a ki point to
bonus action it because used your action--

04:05:18.224 --> 04:05:19.654
MARISHA: Okay, yeah. I will do that.

04:05:19.654 --> 04:05:20.815
MATT: Or vice-versa.
MARISHA: I can do that?

04:05:20.815 --> 04:05:22.372
MATT: Yeah, you can do that, since we drink potions

04:05:22.372 --> 04:05:23.444
as bonus actions.

04:05:24.524 --> 04:05:27.494
MARISHA: I'll be on my guard as I hang limply

04:05:27.494 --> 04:05:30.854
in the arms of an owl.

04:05:30.854 --> 04:05:34.433
? In the arms of the angel ?

04:05:34.433 --> 04:05:36.685
TRAVIS: Go for the bag or something?

04:05:38.494 --> 04:05:39.784
ASHLEY: (exhales) What are you at?

04:05:39.784 --> 04:05:40.884
MARISHA: Clutch.
SAM: ? Fly away ?

04:05:40.884 --> 04:05:42.197
MARISHA: 27 hit points.

04:05:43.122 --> 04:05:44.694
ASHLEY: Yoikes.

04:05:44.694 --> 04:05:46.754
MARISHA: Yeah, I was down to 13.

04:05:46.754 --> 04:05:47.587
MATT: All right.

04:05:49.751 --> 04:05:51.084
Tyffial,

04:05:51.084 --> 04:05:54.224
she now watches Beauregard get pulled off, looks back,

04:05:54.224 --> 04:05:56.994
and now sees Caduceus and Caleb on the ground.

04:05:56.994 --> 04:05:58.624
Caleb still face down in the snow,

04:05:58.624 --> 04:06:00.592
just starting to get up off the ground.

04:06:00.592 --> 04:06:02.907
Caduceus hands up.

04:06:02.907 --> 04:06:05.974
Tyffial goes and pulls out the longsword.

04:06:08.787 --> 04:06:10.494
Runs it along her tongue and as it does you can see

04:06:10.494 --> 04:06:12.068
the red mark across it.

04:06:12.068 --> 04:06:13.151
LIAM: Oh boy.
MATT: And

04:06:13.151 --> 04:06:16.619
that same black, tendril energy

04:06:16.619 --> 04:06:17.757
swirls up it.

04:06:17.757 --> 04:06:19.924
Is going to go ahead and step forward.

04:06:19.924 --> 04:06:21.417
LIAM: Oh boy.
LAURA: Oh no.

04:06:22.784 --> 04:06:24.474
MATT: And stepping towards you, Caleb,

04:06:24.474 --> 04:06:27.664
you watch as the effect on the sword, vanishes.

04:06:27.664 --> 04:06:29.256
LIAM: The what of the sword?
MATT: The effect on the sword.

04:06:29.256 --> 04:06:31.598
LAURA: It's like a bubble around him.
MATT: "Shit."

04:06:31.598 --> 04:06:32.904
SAM: Ooh.

04:06:32.904 --> 04:06:35.654
MATT: And is still going to go ahead and strike towards you.

04:06:38.334 --> 04:06:39.594
11.

04:06:39.594 --> 04:06:41.464
LIAM: Does not hit.
MATT: Shitty roll.

04:06:41.464 --> 04:06:44.914
But can make three attacks so, yeah.

04:06:44.914 --> 04:06:46.874
The first one, (swooshes) you roll out of the way,

04:06:46.874 --> 04:06:48.464
and it (impact) into the ground.

04:06:48.464 --> 04:06:52.244
The second one is 22.
LIAM: And I saw just now,

04:06:52.244 --> 04:06:54.914
that the his sword (blows raspberry)
when he got close to me.

04:06:54.914 --> 04:06:56.364
MATT: Correct.
LIAM: So I'm not even going to burn

04:06:56.364 --> 04:06:58.074
a Shield, it hits.

04:06:58.074 --> 04:07:00.674
MATT: Okay. So you take

04:07:02.795 --> 04:07:04.878
nine points of slashing damage.

04:07:04.878 --> 04:07:07.014
And the third strike

04:07:07.014 --> 04:07:10.694
is a 15-- 16.
LIAM: Hits, yeah.

04:07:10.694 --> 04:07:11.787
MATT: Hits, all right.

04:07:13.984 --> 04:07:16.574
That is going to be 12 points of slashing damage.

04:07:16.574 --> 04:07:18.846
LIAM: Okay.
SAM: Lucien is immune to charm.

04:07:18.846 --> 04:07:20.584
Does that mean that they all are?

04:07:20.584 --> 04:07:22.434
Because they're all a hive mind?

04:07:22.434 --> 04:07:23.633
LIAM: Hard to know.

04:07:23.633 --> 04:07:25.350
LAURA: Probably. Who knows?

04:07:25.350 --> 04:07:27.554
MATT: That ends that go. Caleb, it's your turn.

04:07:27.554 --> 04:07:29.364
LIAM: Oh jeez. I'll get up.

04:07:34.419 --> 04:07:36.374
Ho, boy.
MARISHA: Yeah.

04:07:36.374 --> 04:07:39.064
LIAM: I will move back 15 feet,

04:07:39.064 --> 04:07:40.924
the half of my movement that is left.

04:07:40.924 --> 04:07:43.371
MATT: Okay, Tyffial does get an opportunity attack on you.

04:07:43.371 --> 04:07:44.734
Swinging once more double-handed

04:07:44.734 --> 04:07:47.187
on the longsword towards you for--

04:07:48.064 --> 04:07:49.914
That's going to be a 25 to hit.
LIAM: <i>Ja.</i>

04:07:51.544 --> 04:07:54.234
MATT: You take another 13 points of slashing damage

04:07:54.234 --> 04:07:56.544
as you back out of the range.

04:07:56.544 --> 04:07:58.641
LIAM: Okay, and for my action,

04:07:58.641 --> 04:08:01.714
I'm going to attempt to polymorph myself

04:08:01.714 --> 04:08:04.044
into a giant owl, no idea if I'm out of range

04:08:04.044 --> 04:08:05.354
of whatever this thing is.

04:08:05.354 --> 04:08:06.887
MATT: You finish casting the spell.

04:08:10.011 --> 04:08:12.061
You begin to cast the spell, I should say.

04:08:13.054 --> 04:08:15.587
SAM: What is that? What is going on right there?

04:08:17.244 --> 04:08:21.157
LIAM: He's checking range for Lucien's skullduggery.

04:08:23.144 --> 04:08:23.994
His shenanigans.

04:08:23.994 --> 04:08:25.442
MATT: The spell has no effect.

04:08:25.442 --> 04:08:27.164
LIAM: Not far enough back. Okay.

04:08:27.164 --> 04:08:29.084
SAM: So there's a bubble around Lucien?

04:08:29.084 --> 04:08:31.554
LIAM: Okay.

04:08:31.554 --> 04:08:34.704
MATT: Well, you maintain polymorph by swooping in,

04:08:34.704 --> 04:08:36.524
and swooping over,

04:08:36.524 --> 04:08:38.524
but anything that this way.

04:08:38.524 --> 04:08:40.334
LIAM: He hit an area.
LAURA: Yeah, he did an area.

04:08:40.334 --> 04:08:42.357
LIAM: An area. Non-magic field.

04:08:43.607 --> 04:08:45.244
SAM: Somewhere around there.

04:08:45.244 --> 04:08:47.834
TRAVIS: Where we were coming from because the sword lit up

04:08:47.834 --> 04:08:48.674
and then it went away

04:08:48.674 --> 04:08:50.928
as it went closer to Caleb.
LAURA: Yeah, so it's around you.

04:08:50.928 --> 04:08:51.761
It might be a 20-foot radius--
LIAM: Probably close, though--

04:08:51.761 --> 04:08:54.711
because he hit us in the air, and then we tumbled forwards.

04:08:54.711 --> 04:08:56.767
So, I'm going to guess that I'm close

04:08:56.767 --> 04:08:59.589
to the back of it.
LAURA: Oh, you backed up into it.

04:08:59.589 --> 04:09:00.692
LIAM: Oh, you're right.
LAURA: Yeah, you tumbled forward.

04:09:00.692 --> 04:09:02.624
You backed into the bubble.
LIAM: Sorry, fog of war.

04:09:02.624 --> 04:09:03.457
Too late.

04:09:05.664 --> 04:09:06.644
Next.

04:09:06.644 --> 04:09:08.624
MATT: Well, all right. So--

04:09:08.624 --> 04:09:11.134
Top of the round is Lucien.

04:09:11.134 --> 04:09:12.184
SAM: Wait, I never went.

04:09:13.264 --> 04:09:15.447
MARISHA: You didn't. Oh, you got jumped by Caleb.

04:09:16.284 --> 04:09:18.783
TRAVIS: No, that's right. Beau, Veth, Caleb.

04:09:18.783 --> 04:09:20.774
LIAM: (exhales)
MATT: Right, sorry, my bad.

04:09:20.774 --> 04:09:22.554
Veth, whatchu doing, buddy?

04:09:22.554 --> 04:09:24.029
SAM: (blows raspberry)

04:09:26.716 --> 04:09:27.949
Boy.
LAURA: I don't know!

04:09:27.949 --> 04:09:31.700
SAM: I'm going to grab a handful of buttons and throw them.

04:09:31.700 --> 04:09:32.904
MATT: Okay.

04:09:32.904 --> 04:09:37.034
SAM: And cast Brenatto's Hypnotic Pattern.

04:09:37.034 --> 04:09:38.663
I'm making that up.

04:09:38.663 --> 04:09:41.246
(laughter)

04:09:42.344 --> 04:09:46.984
I'm centering the spot, pretty close to where Lucien

04:09:46.984 --> 04:09:49.254
and Otis are, and it's any creature

04:09:50.654 --> 04:09:52.777
in a 30-foot cube.

04:09:56.064 --> 04:09:57.224
LIAM: We're about to get mangled.

04:09:57.224 --> 04:09:59.084
MATT: Okay.
SAM: With--

04:09:59.084 --> 04:10:00.354
MATT: Centered on Lucien?

04:10:00.354 --> 04:10:03.824
SAM: Well yeah, so that all five of them are in the cube.

04:10:03.824 --> 04:10:06.394
MATT: You got it.
SAM: So how ever far

04:10:06.394 --> 04:10:08.594
back I need to put that so it doesn't hit my two friends.

04:10:08.594 --> 04:10:10.314
SAM: Okay, you got it.

04:10:10.314 --> 04:10:12.974
You all watch as this cube of colors

04:10:12.974 --> 04:10:15.124
swirls like an oil slick,

04:10:15.124 --> 04:10:16.414
you can see the colors and rainbows,

04:10:16.414 --> 04:10:19.364
but it's just this rapid spiral in the middle of the air.

04:10:19.364 --> 04:10:22.654
Except for a odd conical shape,

04:10:22.654 --> 04:10:25.774
coming out from Lucien, right there.

04:10:25.774 --> 04:10:28.473
About, that big.

04:10:28.473 --> 04:10:30.684
LAURA: Wow, that's a big cone.
LIAM: Whoa.

04:10:30.684 --> 04:10:34.345
MATT: Where the colors just do not apparate.

04:10:34.345 --> 04:10:37.147
LIAM: Is that visible to all? That change in the pattern?

04:10:37.984 --> 04:10:40.634
MATT: All who is not in the middle of it.

04:10:40.634 --> 04:10:42.004
You guys, you both are on the ground,

04:10:42.004 --> 04:10:43.014
you see colors around you.

04:10:43.014 --> 04:10:44.614
LIAM: Okay.
MATT: But,

04:10:44.614 --> 04:10:47.724
from your perspective, it's hard to specify.

04:10:47.724 --> 04:10:49.065
LIAM: Okay.

04:10:49.065 --> 04:10:50.115
MATT: You know what,

04:10:50.115 --> 04:10:51.604
have both of you roll insight checks for me,

04:10:51.604 --> 04:10:52.504
if you don't mind.

04:10:54.275 --> 04:10:55.285
Well, you know what, intelligence,

04:10:55.285 --> 04:10:57.070
this would be intelligence,
this would be figuring out, sorry.

04:10:57.070 --> 04:10:58.204
My apologies.
LIAM: Just straight intelligence?

04:10:58.204 --> 04:10:59.820
MATT: Yep, roll a d20, add your intelligence modifier.

04:10:59.820 --> 04:11:01.084
LIAM: 24.
MATT: 24?

04:11:01.084 --> 04:11:02.874
TALIESIN: Nine.
MATT: Nine.

04:11:02.874 --> 04:11:06.301
It alludes you, but immediately
pick up exactly what this is.

04:11:06.301 --> 04:11:08.950
This is some sort of an anti-magic cone effect.

04:11:11.034 --> 04:11:14.385
So with that being the case, Lucien's going to go ahead--

04:11:14.385 --> 04:11:17.561
LIAM: I think about that as I get
hacked to pieces in this next round.

04:11:17.561 --> 04:11:20.310
MARISHA and LIAM: (laugh)

04:11:20.310 --> 04:11:22.287
ASHLEY: Which one is Lucien again?

04:11:22.287 --> 04:11:25.564
TALIESIN: Closest to us, bottom.
LIAM: There's a trio of baddies,

04:11:25.564 --> 04:11:26.754
and he's in that group.

04:11:26.754 --> 04:11:28.704
ASHLEY: He's in the trio?
LIAM: The medium-sized

04:11:28.704 --> 04:11:31.123
figure in the trio.
ASHLEY: Yeah, got it. Okay.

04:11:31.123 --> 04:11:33.282
ASHLEY: ? (imitates background music horn wail) ?

04:11:33.282 --> 04:11:35.644
MATT: All right, so that does come back.

04:11:35.644 --> 04:11:37.809
LAURA: Of course it does.

04:11:39.124 --> 04:11:40.174
TALIESIN: I hate all of this.

04:11:41.544 --> 04:11:44.021
LIAM: (like Caduceus) I got a bad feeling about this.

04:11:44.021 --> 04:11:45.104
MARISHA: Did he just walk up to Cad?

04:11:45.104 --> 04:11:48.184
Just walks up to Caduceus.
SAM: Did my spell have no effect

04:11:48.184 --> 04:11:49.847
on anybody?
MATT: Oh, sorry.

04:11:51.144 --> 04:11:53.177
Put it on those two there.

04:11:56.534 --> 04:11:57.367
LIAM: Oh boy, oh boy.

04:11:58.314 --> 04:12:00.237
MATT: You see Zoran, like,

04:12:01.984 --> 04:12:03.954
blinks his eyes momentarily.

04:12:03.954 --> 04:12:06.047
SAM: It's a 16 save.
MATT: Yes.

04:12:07.314 --> 04:12:08.544
Oh, but it's a charm effect.

04:12:08.544 --> 04:12:10.244
He has advantage against that.

04:12:11.496 --> 04:12:14.918
And he blinks it out and does not seem to be affected.

04:12:14.918 --> 04:12:17.534
MARISHA: Advantage to Zoran?

04:12:17.534 --> 04:12:18.367
SAM: Yeah.

04:12:19.494 --> 04:12:20.774
LAURA: Maybe they all have advantage on it,

04:12:20.774 --> 04:12:21.924
but they're not immune.

04:12:23.614 --> 04:12:25.727
MATT: None of them seem to be affected by it, unfortunately.

04:12:25.727 --> 04:12:27.752
SAM: Then, for my--

04:12:27.752 --> 04:12:30.844
do I see the pouch on Lucien?

04:12:30.844 --> 04:12:32.780
MATT: You would have to make a perception check

04:12:32.780 --> 04:12:34.134
to try and gage that.
SAM: Then I will use my

04:12:34.134 --> 04:12:35.884
bonus action to make a perception check

04:12:35.884 --> 04:12:37.684
or that's an action?

04:12:37.684 --> 04:12:39.804
MATT: For the sake of all that's going on right now,

04:12:39.804 --> 04:12:42.284
and with no light around you, snow falling

04:12:42.284 --> 04:12:44.584
and all this chaos, with just a little bit of firelight

04:12:44.584 --> 04:12:48.154
from the hammer, it's tough since you did cast a spell

04:12:48.154 --> 04:12:49.984
this turn, I'd say you have to wait till your next turn

04:12:49.984 --> 04:12:50.934
to try it.
SAM: Well, then I'll use

04:12:50.934 --> 04:12:53.194
a bonus action to just move Mage Hand

04:12:53.194 --> 04:12:55.487
to follow behind Lucien.

04:12:55.487 --> 04:12:56.824
MATT: Okay.

04:12:56.824 --> 04:12:58.794
Move it 30 feet?
SAM: Yeah.

04:12:58.794 --> 04:13:00.924
MATT: Okay, so not quite to him, but getting in that space.

04:13:00.924 --> 04:13:02.824
LAURA: Where is, when Lucien moves,

04:13:02.824 --> 04:13:05.171
does the cone stay where it was?

04:13:05.171 --> 04:13:07.704
MATT: You don't know, because the hypnotic pattern--

04:13:07.704 --> 04:13:09.704
SAM: I think it just happens instantly.

04:13:09.704 --> 04:13:10.938
MATT: Appears for a moment and then vanishes.

04:13:10.938 --> 04:13:11.771
So you don't know.

04:13:11.771 --> 04:13:13.874
LAURA: Okay.
SAM: ? (imitates music horn wail) ?

04:13:13.874 --> 04:13:16.188
We've heard the song
? too many times tonight. ?

04:13:16.188 --> 04:13:17.692
(laughter)

04:13:17.692 --> 04:13:21.150
LIAM: Two big combats in one episode, oh my god.

04:13:21.150 --> 04:13:23.374
MATT: He's going to walk up to you
with your hands up and be like--

04:13:23.374 --> 04:13:25.791
SAM: ? (sings with background music) ?

04:13:27.313 --> 04:13:29.484
MATT: "It's just business, friend.

04:13:29.484 --> 04:13:30.517
"My apologies,

04:13:31.794 --> 04:13:33.017
"but you didn't have to follow."

04:13:33.017 --> 04:13:34.431
LIAM: Oh no.
SAM: Oh god.

04:13:34.431 --> 04:13:35.490
MATT: And he puts his hand out towards you.

04:13:35.490 --> 04:13:38.739
LAURA: If Taliesin gets killed by his own character.

04:13:38.739 --> 04:13:41.864
MARISHA: Oh my god!

04:13:41.864 --> 04:13:44.007
MATT: That is a--

04:13:45.234 --> 04:13:46.974
LIAM: That is a man going down on himself.

04:13:46.974 --> 04:13:48.714
Oh my god.
MATT: 24 to hit?

04:13:48.714 --> 04:13:49.547
TALIESIN: Oh, that hits.

04:13:49.547 --> 04:13:50.884
MATT: Making constitution saving throw for me, please.

04:13:50.884 --> 04:13:53.454
MARISHA: He's doing the same shit
he did to you that you did to me.

04:13:53.454 --> 04:13:55.924
LIAM: Make the save, goddamn it!

04:13:55.924 --> 04:13:57.812
Gods damn it!

04:13:59.764 --> 04:14:01.964
TALIESIN: I'm literally starting to go blind.
LIAM: Make it.

04:14:01.964 --> 04:14:03.684
TALIESIN: 19.

04:14:03.684 --> 04:14:05.375
MATT: 19?
TALIESIN: Which is good for me.

04:14:06.314 --> 04:14:09.084
MATT: 19 succeeds.
TALIESIN: (sighs)

04:14:09.084 --> 04:14:10.998
MATT: So you take, instead--

04:14:10.998 --> 04:14:11.831
MARISHA: 19.

04:14:13.583 --> 04:14:15.261
LIAM: Back to the program.

04:14:15.261 --> 04:14:17.425
MATT: Oh, fuck me!

04:14:17.425 --> 04:14:18.837
Be glad you made the save.

04:14:19.984 --> 04:14:21.529
TALIESIN: I already am.

04:14:21.529 --> 04:14:24.112
(laughter)

04:14:31.429 --> 04:14:33.950
SAM: He's bluffing, he's got to be bluffing.

04:14:33.950 --> 04:14:35.834
TRAVIS: Get help.

04:14:35.834 --> 04:14:36.667
TALIESIN: Help!

04:14:37.824 --> 04:14:39.644
LAURA: Whose Hail Mary?

04:14:39.644 --> 04:14:40.740
TALIESIN: I have no Hail Mary.

04:14:40.740 --> 04:14:42.190
LIAM: -- has yet to go.

04:14:42.190 --> 04:14:44.084
LAURA: You have a Hail Mary.

04:14:44.084 --> 04:14:45.924
We have a Hail Mary.

04:14:45.924 --> 04:14:48.245
TALIESIN: Magic's not working.
LAURA: You don't know.

04:14:48.245 --> 04:14:49.764
MATT: Half of 77.

04:14:49.764 --> 04:14:50.597
LIAM: It's--

04:14:50.597 --> 04:14:52.264
LAURA: He just tried to do a spell on you.

04:14:54.664 --> 04:14:55.714
TRAVIS: 30.
SAM: 38.

04:14:55.714 --> 04:14:57.687
MATT: You take 38 points of psychic damage.

04:15:00.934 --> 04:15:03.654
TALIESIN: 38 points of psychic damage.

04:15:03.654 --> 04:15:04.487
Ow!

04:15:06.204 --> 04:15:07.037
Ow!

04:15:08.004 --> 04:15:10.424
MATT: You now just have blood pouring from your face,

04:15:10.424 --> 04:15:11.681
you nose, you eyes.

04:15:12.694 --> 04:15:15.064
That finishes Lucien's go.

04:15:15.064 --> 04:15:18.564
It's now Cree's turn, who is no longer stunned

04:15:18.564 --> 04:15:19.622
at the end of your turn, correct?

04:15:19.622 --> 04:15:23.687
MARISHA: So she cannot do, well, yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

04:15:24.604 --> 04:15:26.644
MATT: Since you patience defense and that ended, so,

04:15:26.644 --> 04:15:29.856
Cree can take a turn.
TRAVIS: Got to get out of that cone.

04:15:29.856 --> 04:15:34.194
LIAM: Yeah. The cone travels with Lucien.

04:15:34.194 --> 04:15:35.584
TRAVIS: It does?

04:15:35.584 --> 04:15:36.624
LAURA: Oh, it does?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

04:15:36.624 --> 04:15:38.714
LAURA: He's like a beholder?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

04:15:38.714 --> 04:15:39.547
LIAM: I believe so.

04:15:40.779 --> 04:15:43.234
Well, because, it doesn't make sense for it to stay fixed.

04:15:43.234 --> 04:15:46.051
A cone to stay fixed in the snow.
LAURA: I would just thinking

04:15:46.051 --> 04:15:48.542
it would drop or something, but.

04:15:49.744 --> 04:15:53.435
MATT: Cree is going to go ahead and cast

04:15:53.435 --> 04:15:55.785
Cure Wounds on Lucien.

04:15:58.601 --> 04:16:01.101
LIAM: (sighs)

04:16:02.584 --> 04:16:03.754
MATT: And he is healed up.

04:16:03.754 --> 04:16:05.888
LIAM: We're in a tight spot.

04:16:05.888 --> 04:16:07.888
SAM: This is not looking great.
TALIESIN: Help.

04:16:10.484 --> 04:16:12.727
MATT: Just going to go ahead and back around here.

04:16:13.974 --> 04:16:14.807
SAM: What do we do?

04:16:14.807 --> 04:16:16.377
Do we concentrate the fire--
MATT: Flanking to his back.

04:16:16.377 --> 04:16:17.637
SAM: -- on Lucien, do we talk?

04:16:19.024 --> 04:16:22.053
MARISHA: He doesn't seem to be interested in talking.
MATT: Caduceus,

04:16:22.053 --> 04:16:23.954
it's your turn.
LAURA: They just want to kill.

04:16:23.954 --> 04:16:25.444
LIAM: It's either--

04:16:25.444 --> 04:16:27.497
LAURA: Get away.
LIAM: Make a stand or flee.

04:16:28.584 --> 04:16:30.314
MARISHA: I mean, it feels like we got to run, right?

04:16:30.314 --> 04:16:32.664
SAM: Yeah, but, we can't,

04:16:32.664 --> 04:16:36.085
I guess, Ashley, you can throw Beau on--

04:16:36.085 --> 04:16:36.918
ASHLEY: I'm trying to see if I

04:16:36.918 --> 04:16:39.642
can grab another, that's what
I was going to try, but--

04:16:39.642 --> 04:16:42.504
SAM: Yeah.
ASHLEY: I think I could grab--

04:16:42.504 --> 04:16:43.607
SAM: Caleb?
ASHLEY: Caleb.

04:16:44.526 --> 04:16:48.134
LAURA: No. No. No. Don't fly in there. Don't fly in there.

04:16:48.134 --> 04:16:49.544
TALIESIN: Let's see.
ASHLEY: Is it my turn?

04:16:49.544 --> 04:16:50.894
TRAVIS: Shit.
TALIESIN: No, it's my turn,

04:16:50.894 --> 04:16:52.154
which really fucking sucks.

04:16:52.154 --> 04:16:54.168
MARISHA: Yeah, if you fly into that cone, you'll lose.

04:16:54.168 --> 04:16:56.444
TRAVIS: Fly around Lucien.

04:16:56.444 --> 04:16:57.751
MARISHA: So yeah, stay on Lucien's back.

04:16:57.751 --> 04:16:59.074
SAM: Lucien is looking at Caleb right now.

04:16:59.074 --> 04:17:01.114
LAURA: Yeah, Lucien's looking, the cone is on both of them

04:17:01.114 --> 04:17:02.714
right now, don't fly over there.

04:17:03.562 --> 04:17:04.395
LIAM: (sighs)

04:17:04.395 --> 04:17:05.461
ASHLEY: Okay.

04:17:05.461 --> 04:17:07.377
ASHLEY: Fuck.
TALIESIN: Fuck, man.

04:17:09.151 --> 04:17:12.439
LIAM: Caduceus didn't really understand the cone.

04:17:12.439 --> 04:17:13.897
ASHLEY: How did I get Beau if--

04:17:15.614 --> 04:17:17.347
SAM: We avoided the cone.

04:17:17.347 --> 04:17:18.724
MATT: You swooped down above,

04:17:18.724 --> 04:17:20.577
and grabbed her and took off.

04:17:21.784 --> 04:17:24.204
The cone, from what you could see, was this way,

04:17:24.204 --> 04:17:26.407
and you came down this way, over top of him.

04:17:27.524 --> 04:17:29.004
LIAM: And--
MATT: Beauregard was being held

04:17:29.004 --> 04:17:32.470
to the side, right here.
Or to this side it would

04:17:32.470 --> 04:17:34.594
be in the cone.
SAM: Well, I saw it.

04:17:34.594 --> 04:17:35.842
I cast my--

04:17:35.842 --> 04:17:39.514
MATT: I'll say you got very lucky
at the angle you swooped in on.

04:17:39.514 --> 04:17:41.024
SAM: I assume I saw it.
LIAM: Oh, he was talking about us

04:17:41.024 --> 04:17:42.133
being in the middle of it, right?

04:17:42.133 --> 04:17:42.966
LAURA: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

04:17:42.966 --> 04:17:43.864
LIAM: Cool.
TALIESIN: Getting out of a grapple

04:17:43.864 --> 04:17:44.697
is an action?

04:17:45.534 --> 04:17:47.744
MATT: You're not--
TALIESIN: I'm not grappled,

04:17:47.744 --> 04:17:48.608
what am I?

04:17:48.608 --> 04:17:49.441
MATT: You're not typically grappled,

04:17:49.441 --> 04:17:50.464
he's just holding your throat.

04:17:50.464 --> 04:17:52.134
He's not like holding you in place.

04:17:52.134 --> 04:17:54.944
He just grabbed you to do do a shit ton of psychic damage.

04:17:54.944 --> 04:17:58.174
He's holding on, but it's not a huge thing.

04:17:58.174 --> 04:18:03.174
TALIESIN: So I can try and run away?

04:18:03.312 --> 04:18:04.704
MATT: You can try.

04:18:04.704 --> 04:18:05.770
TALIESIN: (sighs)

04:18:05.770 --> 04:18:07.420
I'm going to--

04:18:07.420 --> 04:18:08.803
LIAM: It's just risking opportunity attack,

04:18:08.803 --> 04:18:10.464
but he doesn't have you grappled.

04:18:10.464 --> 04:18:11.947
TALIESIN: Yeah, so I'm going to--

04:18:12.903 --> 04:18:13.974
LIAM: Where you at?

04:18:13.974 --> 04:18:16.044
TALIESIN: I'm okay.
LIAM: Okay.

04:18:16.044 --> 04:18:17.874
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and, not for long,

04:18:17.874 --> 04:18:19.464
considering what happened there.

04:18:19.464 --> 04:18:22.024
I'm going to try and use, this is not a spell,

04:18:22.024 --> 04:18:23.934
but I have a thing where I can turn invisible,

04:18:23.934 --> 04:18:26.234
I'm going to try and do it as my bonus action.

04:18:27.204 --> 04:18:28.784
MATT: Okay. It does not happen.

04:18:28.784 --> 04:18:31.864
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to try run towards Caleb.

04:18:31.864 --> 04:18:32.924
MATT: At this proximity.

04:18:32.924 --> 04:18:36.204
At this proximity, with your ability to,

04:18:36.204 --> 04:18:38.214
your passive perception, you can see,

04:18:38.214 --> 04:18:40.124
while he's holding you and facing you,

04:18:40.124 --> 04:18:42.484
the red eye on this side of the chest,

04:18:42.484 --> 04:18:44.763
is currently glowing brighter than the others,

04:18:44.763 --> 04:18:45.814
who are all just faintly glowing.

04:18:45.814 --> 04:18:47.487
So there's one eye right here.

04:18:49.324 --> 04:18:50.357
TALIESIN: Okay.

04:18:53.644 --> 04:18:54.477
Okay.

04:18:54.477 --> 04:18:58.234
I'm just going to try and make a break towards Caleb.

04:18:58.234 --> 04:18:59.067
MATT: Towards Caleb?

04:19:00.344 --> 04:19:02.347
Okay. You run to Caleb.

04:19:06.954 --> 04:19:11.562
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and grab Caleb, and try and--

04:19:11.562 --> 04:19:12.512
fuck.

04:19:13.694 --> 04:19:15.224
LIAM: I'll do it.

04:19:15.224 --> 04:19:17.974
TALIESIN: Yeah. I'm going to grab Caleb, and I'm going to

04:19:18.954 --> 04:19:22.144
drag him as far as I can, with what little movement

04:19:22.144 --> 04:19:23.344
I have left.
MATT: Little movement

04:19:23.344 --> 04:19:24.601
you have left which direction?

04:19:24.601 --> 04:19:26.454
LIAM: (nervous noises)

04:19:26.454 --> 04:19:29.267
MATT: Liam?
ASHLEY: (laughs)

04:19:31.444 --> 04:19:34.034
TALIESIN: Is Caleb have a feeling about this?

04:19:34.034 --> 04:19:35.006
LIAM: No.
LAURA: (laughs) Just go

04:19:35.006 --> 04:19:37.740
whichever direction you want to go.

04:19:37.740 --> 04:19:39.964
MATT: Can't go away yet.
TALIESIN: Try to just.

04:19:39.964 --> 04:19:41.744
MATT: This way?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

04:19:41.744 --> 04:19:42.854
Just like to no, no,

04:19:42.854 --> 04:19:44.744
just like to the-- yeah, like--
MATT: This way?

04:19:44.744 --> 04:19:45.764
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah, like.

04:19:45.764 --> 04:19:47.114
MATT: That's as far as you can get, unfortunately.

04:19:47.114 --> 04:19:48.954
Because also pushing him and dragging him out the way

04:19:48.954 --> 04:19:51.094
in forced movement, it reduces

04:19:51.094 --> 04:19:53.654
your movement by half, so you moved 15 feet to get this way,

04:19:53.654 --> 04:19:55.388
and like maybe 10 feet--
TALIESIN: Okay.

04:19:55.388 --> 04:19:57.094
Couldn't quite angle it?

04:19:57.094 --> 04:19:58.394
MATT: That's as far as you can get.

04:19:58.394 --> 04:20:01.824
MATT: All right. I'm going to for Hail Mary,
I'm going to try and--

04:20:01.824 --> 04:20:02.744
MATT: Well, you have an action?

04:20:02.744 --> 04:20:03.577
TALIESIN: I do have an action.

04:20:03.577 --> 04:20:04.904
MATT: You could use your action to move

04:20:04.904 --> 04:20:06.475
and push you both further, it's up to you.

04:20:06.475 --> 04:20:08.808
TALIESIN: (exhales)

04:20:14.094 --> 04:20:16.894
LAURA: Are you out of it? I can't tell if you're out of it.

04:20:16.894 --> 04:20:20.817
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and cast Bless.

04:20:22.774 --> 04:20:24.607
MATT: Nothing happens.
TALIESIN: Fuck!

04:20:26.204 --> 04:20:29.924
MATT: When he walked towards you, he turned to face you

04:20:29.924 --> 04:20:32.817
at an angle where Caleb was behind you.

04:20:34.364 --> 04:20:35.917
LAURA: Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

04:20:36.209 --> 04:20:37.761
MATT: That finishes your turn, Caduceus?

04:20:37.761 --> 04:20:38.881
LAURA: Okay.

04:20:38.881 --> 04:20:40.531
TALIESIN: Fuck, I guess so.

04:20:40.531 --> 04:20:42.761
MATT: All right, it's Otis' go.

04:20:42.761 --> 04:20:44.200
Otis is over here.

04:20:44.200 --> 04:20:48.964
He's going to go ahead and getting the crossbow there,

04:20:48.964 --> 04:20:51.571
he's going to look over towards the eagle in the air--

04:20:51.571 --> 04:20:53.811
or the owl in the air

04:20:53.811 --> 04:20:54.971
and Eldritch Blast

04:20:55.961 --> 04:20:57.201
SAM: Eldritch Blast!

04:20:57.201 --> 04:20:59.020
MATT: Three of them towards you.

04:20:59.020 --> 04:21:02.155
SAM: Ugh. I <i>hate</i> Otis.

04:21:02.155 --> 04:21:05.731
(laughter)

04:21:05.731 --> 04:21:08.011
MATT: That is 20 to hit?

04:21:08.011 --> 04:21:08.844
ASHLEY: Yeah.

04:21:10.471 --> 04:21:11.304
MATT: 16?

04:21:11.304 --> 04:21:14.096
ASHLEY: No.
LIAM: My T-shirt is the game today.

04:21:14.096 --> 04:21:16.071
MATT: This is against the owl's AC.

04:21:16.071 --> 04:21:17.381
ASHLEY: Oh, I don't know the owl's AC.

04:21:17.381 --> 04:21:18.631
LAURA: It's 19.
MARISHA: Your T-shirt is all of us.

04:21:18.631 --> 04:21:20.579
LAURA: Oh, 17 is the owl's AC.

04:21:20.579 --> 04:21:21.591
MATT: So 16 did miss?

04:21:21.591 --> 04:21:22.649
ASHLEY: Okay.

04:21:22.649 --> 04:21:24.458
MATT: The other one, however, is a natural 20.

04:21:24.458 --> 04:21:25.291
LIAM: I do.

04:21:25.291 --> 04:21:26.467
ASHLEY: Okay.
TALIESIN: Did I make it harder?

04:21:26.467 --> 04:21:28.091
MARISHA: (giggles)
LIAM: No.

04:21:28.091 --> 04:21:28.924
No, I thought--
ASHLEY: Okay.

04:21:28.924 --> 04:21:30.126
MATT: From the two hits,

04:21:30.126 --> 04:21:32.587
you take seven points

04:21:32.587 --> 04:21:34.226
of force damage,

04:21:35.511 --> 04:21:38.644
and then 10 points of force damage.

04:21:39.491 --> 04:21:40.771
With each of these blasts,

04:21:40.771 --> 04:21:43.161
you feel this energy sucking you backward.

04:21:43.161 --> 04:21:45.674
With each hit, you're pulled 10 feet back.

04:21:45.674 --> 04:21:46.507
MARISHA: Son of a--

04:21:46.507 --> 04:21:47.752
SAM: Is that a thing?!
ASHLEY: Darn it.

04:21:47.752 --> 04:21:48.771
SAM: Is that a thing?

04:21:48.771 --> 04:21:49.989
LAURA: Fucking...

04:21:49.989 --> 04:21:52.192
MATT: It's an Eldritch Invocation.

04:21:52.192 --> 04:21:53.387
SAM: (sighs)

04:21:53.387 --> 04:21:55.341
You can tractor beam?

04:21:55.341 --> 04:21:56.521
LAURA: Yep.

04:21:56.521 --> 04:21:57.861
Yeah, there's a tractor beam.

04:21:57.861 --> 04:21:59.405
MATT: Because it was a cantrip, as a bonus action,

04:21:59.405 --> 04:22:01.391
he can attack with the Mystic Frenzy ability,

04:22:01.391 --> 04:22:02.401
which means he gets one more.

04:22:02.401 --> 04:22:04.892
After releasing the Eldritch Blast, goes

04:22:04.892 --> 04:22:05.912
(bow firing)

04:22:05.912 --> 04:22:09.066
and fires the crossbow as a bonus action towards you.

04:22:09.066 --> 04:22:10.258
LIAM: These bitches aren't playing around.

04:22:10.258 --> 04:22:11.763
MATT: That is a--

04:22:11.763 --> 04:22:12.596
LIAM: Goddamn it.

04:22:12.596 --> 04:22:14.093
ASHLEY: Did you already do the natural 20?

04:22:14.093 --> 04:22:14.991
MATT: Yes, I did.

04:22:14.991 --> 04:22:16.331
It didn't roll that great on the die.

04:22:16.331 --> 04:22:17.164
ASHLEY: Okay.

04:22:17.164 --> 04:22:18.521
MATT: It's Eldritch Blast, so just a d10.

04:22:18.521 --> 04:22:20.289
That is a 27 to hit.

04:22:20.289 --> 04:22:21.731
ASHLEY: Yeah.
LIAM: Mother bitch.

04:22:21.731 --> 04:22:23.272
MATT: You take

04:22:25.239 --> 04:22:27.391
11 points of piercing damage

04:22:27.391 --> 04:22:30.081
and six points of lightning damage.

04:22:30.081 --> 04:22:31.041
ASHLEY: Okay.

04:22:31.041 --> 04:22:33.808
MATT: So how many hit points?
LAURA: You're no longer a giant owl.

04:22:34.701 --> 04:22:35.663
MARISHA: Yeah, there's--

04:22:35.663 --> 04:22:37.751
LAURA: You would have turned after the...

04:22:38.621 --> 04:22:39.591
Well, yeah after that hit,

04:22:39.591 --> 04:22:40.424
you would have turned back into--

04:22:40.424 --> 04:22:41.805
LIAM: Goddamn it.

04:22:41.805 --> 04:22:43.801
MATT: You all-- You weren't that high up

04:22:43.801 --> 04:22:45.818
because you're pulled closer to the ground with each hit

04:22:45.818 --> 04:22:47.711
and you all fall and land in the snow,

04:22:47.711 --> 04:22:48.544
no longer an eagle.

04:22:48.544 --> 04:22:49.751
LIAM: Oh shit.

04:22:49.751 --> 04:22:52.651
Shit, we are in the shit.

04:22:52.651 --> 04:22:54.041
MARISHA: We got to get out of here.

04:22:54.041 --> 04:22:55.561
LIAM: We just lost another owl.

04:22:55.561 --> 04:22:56.394
LAURA: Yeah.

04:22:57.591 --> 04:22:58.629
MATT: That brings us to Jester's turn.

04:22:58.629 --> 04:23:00.823
MARISHA: Got to get out of here. Some way.
TRAVIS: Jester and Fjord.

04:23:00.823 --> 04:23:01.837
SAM: I got to get out of here.

04:23:01.837 --> 04:23:04.101
MARISHA: (laughs)

04:23:04.101 --> 04:23:05.131
LAURA: I--

04:23:05.131 --> 04:23:05.964
LIAM: Fuck!

04:23:07.231 --> 04:23:10.528
LAURA: Have a thing.
MARISHA: Do you have any--

04:23:10.528 --> 04:23:13.871
LAURA: But I am terrified to do it

04:23:13.871 --> 04:23:16.288
for fear of my other friends,

04:23:17.881 --> 04:23:21.104
and never mind because I

04:23:21.104 --> 04:23:25.419
? already did a 7th-level spell today ?

04:23:25.419 --> 04:23:26.599
MATT: Mm-hmm.

04:23:27.641 --> 04:23:28.781
TRAVIS: Is that me?

04:23:28.781 --> 04:23:31.701
LAURA: No, I did my 6th-level spell healing you.

04:23:31.701 --> 04:23:34.041
So this takes this out of commission.

04:23:34.041 --> 04:23:35.011
Never mind.
LIAM: How is this harder

04:23:35.011 --> 04:23:37.101
than the ancient dragon?

04:23:37.101 --> 04:23:37.934
MARISHA: It tracks.

04:23:37.934 --> 04:23:39.221
TALIESIN: You move too fast, man.

04:23:39.221 --> 04:23:40.321
TRAVIS: Same day? Yeah.

04:23:40.321 --> 04:23:41.154
MARISHA: Yeah, same day.

04:23:41.154 --> 04:23:43.161
LIAM: Same day.
TALIESIN: Fuck, man.

04:23:43.161 --> 04:23:45.931
LIAM: This is the Raishan fight after the Thordak fight.

04:23:45.931 --> 04:23:47.597
MARISHA: Oh my god. That's right.

04:23:47.597 --> 04:23:48.914
TALIESIN: Oh fuck.

04:23:50.021 --> 04:23:53.111
MARISHA: You don't have anything like an Expeditious Retreat

04:23:53.111 --> 04:23:53.944
in your back pocket?

04:23:53.944 --> 04:23:55.681
LIAM: I have some things, but--

04:23:55.681 --> 04:23:57.371
TRAVIS: Not in a non-magic cone.

04:23:57.371 --> 04:23:58.204
MARISHA: Right.

04:23:58.204 --> 04:23:59.951
LIAM: Everything I was going to do just changed

04:23:59.951 --> 04:24:03.658
when another owl fell out of the sky.

04:24:03.658 --> 04:24:04.941
LIAM: (sighs)

04:24:04.941 --> 04:24:06.108
LAURA: What do I--

04:24:08.331 --> 04:24:10.281
I can't cast spells as an owl.

04:24:10.281 --> 04:24:11.114
MATT: No.
LIAM: Nope.

04:24:12.391 --> 04:24:13.831
You can hoot, though.

04:24:13.831 --> 04:24:17.251
TRAVIS: You could drop it, I guess. Is that an action?

04:24:17.251 --> 04:24:18.551
MARISHA: Try and fly someone out?

04:24:19.551 --> 04:24:20.384
TALIESIN: Dropping it's--

04:24:20.384 --> 04:24:22.311
LIAM: No, dropping it's nothing.

04:24:22.311 --> 04:24:23.911
MATT: Dropping it doesn't take an action at all.

04:24:23.911 --> 04:24:26.581
You can move your eagle's move back 60 feet

04:24:26.581 --> 04:24:27.662
if you wanted to try and get back--
LIAM: Then drop it.

04:24:27.662 --> 04:24:29.378
- in the fray and then drop it, but that's up to you.

04:24:30.756 --> 04:24:33.591
LIAM: (exhales)

04:24:37.057 --> 04:24:38.624
SAM: Yeah, I mean, we can all run.

04:24:40.021 --> 04:24:40.991
MARISHA: Well, I mean, if you--

04:24:40.991 --> 04:24:42.274
SAM: Like, just run fast.

04:24:42.274 --> 04:24:43.761
MARISHA: Well, you said you have Expeditious--

04:24:43.761 --> 04:24:44.594
you have stuff, but you can't--

04:24:44.594 --> 04:24:47.061
LIAM: No, I do not have Expeditious. I mean, you don't know.

04:24:47.061 --> 04:24:49.061
No, I don't have that spell prepared.

04:24:49.061 --> 04:24:50.851
I had ideas, not Expeditious Retreat.

04:24:50.851 --> 04:24:52.421
MARISHA: Well, if you have ideas

04:24:52.421 --> 04:24:55.101
and we can get you out of the non-magical...

04:24:55.101 --> 04:24:56.684
Oh, no, never mind.

04:24:58.381 --> 04:24:59.661
SAM: You could run out of it.

04:24:59.661 --> 04:25:01.631
No, yes, maybe?

04:25:01.631 --> 04:25:02.671
LIAM: For how long?

04:25:02.671 --> 04:25:05.154
SAM: And then when you're out of it, do a spell.

04:25:06.461 --> 04:25:07.294
You know?
LIAM: Yes,

04:25:07.294 --> 04:25:09.364
that's the first part of any idea I have.

04:25:09.364 --> 04:25:12.421
Any idea I have starts with dragging Caduceus

04:25:12.421 --> 04:25:14.791
or me running out of the cone.

04:25:14.791 --> 04:25:16.241
That's the first part of anything.

04:25:16.241 --> 04:25:18.981
MATT: Well, Jester, Fjord, what are you guys doing?

04:25:18.981 --> 04:25:19.814
LAURA: Sorry.
MATT: (claps)

04:25:19.814 --> 04:25:20.647
LAURA: I'm sorry.

04:25:20.647 --> 04:25:21.701
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: Let's get this TPK going.

04:25:21.701 --> 04:25:22.582
Come on.
LAURA: Horrible.

04:25:22.582 --> 04:25:24.341
MARISHA: (laughs)

04:25:24.341 --> 04:25:26.388
SAM: Can we zoom in a little bit?

04:25:27.526 --> 04:25:28.789
LAURA: (laughs)
SAM: I can't see it.

04:25:28.789 --> 04:25:29.622
LIAM: Yeah, can we get a new angle on the screen?

04:25:29.622 --> 04:25:30.881
LAURA: I'm just so--

04:25:30.881 --> 04:25:32.309
MATT: Sorry, if I knew this would be this long,

04:25:32.309 --> 04:25:34.029
I would have just put another snow thing down

04:25:34.029 --> 04:25:34.967
just to have a better texture.

04:25:34.967 --> 04:25:37.341
So we're just getting tabletop here.

04:25:37.341 --> 04:25:38.701
SAM: It makes it creepier.

04:25:38.701 --> 04:25:39.534
LAURA: It's creepier--

04:25:39.534 --> 04:25:41.566
MATT: I guess it is night time. That's true.

04:25:41.566 --> 04:25:43.211
LAURA: I can't see shit.

04:25:43.211 --> 04:25:46.475
I guess I'm going to fly in 60 feet.

04:25:47.711 --> 04:25:49.191
MATT: All right.

04:25:49.191 --> 04:25:52.531
Around 60 feet gets you approximately

04:25:52.531 --> 04:25:54.186
back at this place on the battlefield.

04:25:54.186 --> 04:25:56.056
LIAM: You're still fucked up, right?

04:25:56.056 --> 04:25:57.071
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

04:25:57.071 --> 04:25:59.321
LAURA: Everybody's still fucked.

04:26:03.241 --> 04:26:04.074
ASHLEY: What if...

04:26:06.021 --> 04:26:08.041
What if we let them take it?

04:26:08.041 --> 04:26:09.831
TALIESIN: They're going to take it anyway.

04:26:09.831 --> 04:26:10.664
ASHLEY: And then--

04:26:10.664 --> 04:26:13.011
LIAM: Yeah, now they're having fun.

04:26:13.011 --> 04:26:14.071
LAURA: They're going to take it anyway.

04:26:14.071 --> 04:26:15.571
ASHLEY: We'll just go...

04:26:16.851 --> 04:26:19.518
LAURA: Now they're just here to kill.

04:26:22.001 --> 04:26:23.207
TRAVIS: What is that thing in the middle,

04:26:23.207 --> 04:26:24.931
the little clear thing?

04:26:24.931 --> 04:26:27.051
MATT: That's his hand.

04:26:27.051 --> 04:26:28.331
TRAVIS: Whose hand?
SAM: My hand.

04:26:28.331 --> 04:26:30.397
MATT: His magic hand. Mage hand.

04:26:30.397 --> 04:26:32.064
LAURA: I can't.

04:26:33.151 --> 04:26:38.151
If I dove in and tried to grab Beau,

04:26:38.481 --> 04:26:41.491
I wouldn't be able to get back out, right?

04:26:41.491 --> 04:26:43.158
That would get me--

04:26:44.491 --> 04:26:47.151
MARISHA: It seems like the people in the cone--
LAURA: I'd have to use another action.

04:26:47.151 --> 04:26:48.441
I'm just going to stay where I am

04:26:48.441 --> 04:26:51.599
and hopefully Fjord will do something.

04:26:51.599 --> 04:26:52.511
TRAVIS: (laughs)

04:26:52.511 --> 04:26:53.631
MATT: So you're not going to move any closer?

04:26:53.631 --> 04:26:54.622
You're going to stay where you are?

04:26:54.622 --> 04:26:56.581
LAURA: I flew in 60 feet.

04:26:56.581 --> 04:26:57.741
MATT: Right, but you still have your action,

04:26:57.741 --> 04:26:59.121
which you can use the dash and move more

04:26:59.121 --> 04:26:59.954
or you can stay put.

04:26:59.954 --> 04:27:01.825
LAURA: Right.

04:27:01.825 --> 04:27:05.271
MARISHA: You guys are still our only potential Hail Mary

04:27:05.271 --> 04:27:06.951
with the threshold crest.

04:27:06.951 --> 04:27:09.191
LAURA: I know, but I don't know what to do with it.

04:27:09.191 --> 04:27:11.271
MARISHA: Well, you just have to get out.

04:27:11.271 --> 04:27:12.651
LAURA: I know.

04:27:12.651 --> 04:27:13.535
MARISHA: So it might be...

04:27:13.535 --> 04:27:15.451
Yeah, I don't think that's a bad instinct

04:27:15.451 --> 04:27:16.284
is what I'm saying.

04:27:16.284 --> 04:27:17.956
LAURA: To stay?
MARISHA: Yeah.

04:27:17.956 --> 04:27:20.239
TRAVIS: I just don't know if you'd get out without us.

04:27:20.239 --> 04:27:22.516
LAURA: How far can you attack from?

04:27:22.516 --> 04:27:23.821
How close do you have to be?

04:27:23.821 --> 04:27:24.987
TRAVIS: To attack?
LAURA: Yeah.

04:27:24.987 --> 04:27:27.153
TRAVIS: I've got Eldritch Blast,
I can shoot from a mile away,

04:27:27.153 --> 04:27:28.941
but I'm just hitting people.

04:27:28.941 --> 04:27:30.121
LAURA: Well, try to hit some people,

04:27:30.121 --> 04:27:33.401
at least, so we're not just doing nothing.

04:27:33.401 --> 04:27:34.234
MATT: But are staying put or moving?

04:27:34.234 --> 04:27:35.921
LAURA: I'm staying where I am.

04:27:35.921 --> 04:27:37.501
MATT: Okay.

04:27:37.501 --> 04:27:39.301
TRAVIS: Yeah, but hitting people doesn't do anything.

04:27:39.301 --> 04:27:40.554
I need to move people.

04:27:41.831 --> 04:27:43.611
MATT: Make your choice, or we're
going to lose the rest of the round.

04:27:43.611 --> 04:27:44.481
Are you moving or are you staying?

04:27:44.481 --> 04:27:45.905
LAURA: I made my choice, I'm staying.
MATT: Okay, staying.

04:27:45.905 --> 04:27:49.031
All right, Fjord, what are you doing?

04:27:49.031 --> 04:27:51.028
TRAVIS: I'll take my 60 seconds to think.

04:27:51.028 --> 04:27:53.671
(laughter)

04:27:53.671 --> 04:27:54.988
MATT: On top of a two minutes that--

04:27:54.988 --> 04:27:55.821
LIAM: Yeah.

04:27:55.821 --> 04:27:56.654
TRAVIS: It wasn't my turn.

04:27:56.654 --> 04:27:58.126
(laughter)

04:27:58.126 --> 04:27:59.126
MATT: Respect.

04:27:59.126 --> 04:27:59.959
Respect.

04:28:01.233 --> 04:28:02.766
ASHLEY: (exhales)
LIAM: Fuck.

04:28:04.321 --> 04:28:05.391
LIAM: While he's thinking--
TRAVIS: Yeah.

04:28:05.391 --> 04:28:06.301
LIAM: What's the order?

04:28:06.301 --> 04:28:07.601
It's Fjord, then what, then what?

04:28:07.601 --> 04:28:08.456
Then who, then who?

04:28:08.456 --> 04:28:10.720
MATT: Fjord, Zoran,

04:28:10.720 --> 04:28:12.461
Yasha, Beau, Veth,

04:28:12.461 --> 04:28:13.344
Tyffial,

04:28:13.344 --> 04:28:15.421
then you, then Lucien.

04:28:15.421 --> 04:28:17.428
LIAM: So I can just chill and die.

04:28:17.428 --> 04:28:18.991
MARISHA: Fjord, then Zoran?

04:28:18.991 --> 04:28:20.741
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: Correct.

04:28:20.741 --> 04:28:21.691
LAURA: And where's Otis?

04:28:21.691 --> 04:28:23.721
Otis is after Caduceus?

04:28:23.721 --> 04:28:24.991
MATT: Otis is--

04:28:24.991 --> 04:28:27.231
No, Otis already went after Caduceus.

04:28:27.231 --> 04:28:29.275
Yeah.
LIAM: 2020 Fjord Zoran.

04:28:29.275 --> 04:28:31.321
MARISHA: (laughs)

04:28:31.321 --> 04:28:33.391
TRAVIS: Can you show me what a 30-foot distance is

04:28:33.391 --> 04:28:35.301
from where I am into the melee?

04:28:35.301 --> 04:28:36.384
SAM: He's immune to charm,

04:28:36.384 --> 04:28:38.344
but he's not immune to spells.
TRAVIS: Because I don't see any squares.

04:28:38.344 --> 04:28:40.575
SAM: But he does have legendary resistances, right?

04:28:40.575 --> 04:28:41.408
LIAM: Yeah.

04:28:41.408 --> 04:28:43.341
SAM: Which he hasn't used?
MATT: 30 feet's about there.

04:28:43.341 --> 04:28:45.571
SAM: Wait, no, he has legendary actions.
TRAVIS: Gotcha, okay.

04:28:45.571 --> 04:28:47.811
LIAM: We don't know if he has resistances or not.

04:28:47.811 --> 04:28:49.631
MARISHA: Well, he saved from--

04:28:49.631 --> 04:28:51.166
ASHLEY: That's how far the cone goes?

04:28:51.166 --> 04:28:53.143
MATT: No, that's 30 feet from where he is.

04:28:53.143 --> 04:28:53.976
MARISHA: No, I thinking I'm getting--

04:28:53.976 --> 04:28:55.445
MATT: You guy don't know how far the cone goes,

04:28:55.445 --> 04:28:57.391
you just know the shape of it.

04:28:57.391 --> 04:28:59.591
SAM: We saw him use a legendary action.

04:28:59.591 --> 04:29:00.424
MARISHA: Yeah.
LAURA: That was it?

04:29:00.424 --> 04:29:01.257
That was 30 feet?

04:29:01.257 --> 04:29:03.171
SAM: But not a legendary resistance.

04:29:03.171 --> 04:29:04.121
MARISHA: We haven't seen that yet.

04:29:04.121 --> 04:29:06.701
TRAVIS: I'm going to use my--
SAM: Fuck.

04:29:06.701 --> 04:29:07.534
MARISHA: I know.

04:29:07.534 --> 04:29:10.061
TRAVIS: I'm going to go in on foot 30 feet.

04:29:10.061 --> 04:29:10.894
No.

04:29:10.894 --> 04:29:14.061
No, 30 feet won't get me close enough.

04:29:15.239 --> 04:29:16.839
I'm going to...

04:29:18.978 --> 04:29:20.404
MATT: Do you want Jester to carry you both closer?

04:29:20.404 --> 04:29:22.454
LAURA: I can. I have movement.

04:29:22.454 --> 04:29:25.171
You can hee-yah me, if you want.

04:29:25.171 --> 04:29:27.211
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, you want to get me within 30 feet?

04:29:27.211 --> 04:29:28.481
LAURA: Sure.
TRAVIS: Do it.

04:29:28.481 --> 04:29:30.291
LAURA: We've got the move right after each other,

04:29:30.291 --> 04:29:31.124
so it makes sense.

04:29:31.124 --> 04:29:33.121
MATT: You can right there, if you
want to keep it not too close.

04:29:33.121 --> 04:29:34.281
TRAVIS: Sure.

04:29:34.281 --> 04:29:35.614
LAURA: Are you jumping off or are you just...

04:29:35.614 --> 04:29:37.441
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm getting off.

04:29:37.441 --> 04:29:39.191
MATT: All right, so you jump off about there.

04:29:39.191 --> 04:29:41.374
LAURA: Can I use the rest of my movement to back up?

04:29:43.421 --> 04:29:45.171
MATT: If you want to. (wings flapping)

04:29:46.031 --> 04:29:47.131
LAURA: Yep.
MATT: About there?

04:29:48.521 --> 04:29:49.361
LAURA: Sure.

04:29:49.361 --> 04:29:51.681
I just want to-- Yeah, I want to be far away from Lucien.

04:29:51.681 --> 04:29:52.514
MATT: Okay.

04:29:53.791 --> 04:29:57.911
TRAVIS: I'm going to use my bonus action

04:29:57.911 --> 04:30:01.031
to Channel Divinity, Fury of the Tides.

04:30:01.031 --> 04:30:03.061
I'm going to walk up to this side of Lucien

04:30:04.021 --> 04:30:07.311
and I'm going to take two swings at him with--

04:30:07.311 --> 04:30:09.469
MATT: That's not Lucien, that's Tyffial.

04:30:09.469 --> 04:30:11.341
Lucien's over here.
TRAVIS: Oh.

04:30:11.341 --> 04:30:12.741
Well, that changes shit.

04:30:12.741 --> 04:30:13.921
I saw a bright coat.

04:30:13.921 --> 04:30:15.521
I thought that was Moll-- Lucien.

04:30:15.521 --> 04:30:16.354
MATT: Sorry, there you go.

04:30:16.354 --> 04:30:18.161
There's the bright coat.

04:30:18.161 --> 04:30:20.428
TRAVIS Fuck, and he's-- Oh, fuck me.

04:30:20.428 --> 04:30:23.198
So the cone's facing this way?

04:30:23.198 --> 04:30:25.381
MATT: You assumed it was facing somewhere in the direction

04:30:25.381 --> 04:30:27.881
that he was facing when he came over towards Caduceus.

04:30:27.881 --> 04:30:29.346
LAURA: Yeah, wherever his eyes are.

04:30:29.346 --> 04:30:30.331
MARISHA: You all right?

04:30:30.331 --> 04:30:33.493
LIAM: As if real life wasn't giving me enough panic attacks.

04:30:33.493 --> 04:30:34.634
MARISHA: Oh man, this is awesome.
LIAM: But we had to

04:30:34.634 --> 04:30:36.689
come here to manufacture a faux panic attack.

04:30:36.689 --> 04:30:38.355
TRAVIS: I'm doing this. Doing this.
ASHLEY: I love it.

04:30:38.355 --> 04:30:39.188
MATT: You don't know.

04:30:39.188 --> 04:30:40.021
TALIESIN: This is real.

04:30:40.021 --> 04:30:43.311
I'm having a real panic attack.
SAM: You might be standing in it right now.

04:30:43.311 --> 04:30:44.851
TRAVIS: The only thing that gave you any indication

04:30:44.851 --> 04:30:46.331
was that Hypnotic Pattern,

04:30:46.331 --> 04:30:48.971
that one flash of energy gave you a momentary view

04:30:48.971 --> 04:30:50.601
of the area of negative space

04:30:50.601 --> 04:30:52.531
where the magic could not penetrate.

04:30:52.531 --> 04:30:54.781
Beyond that, it's guesswork.

04:30:57.351 --> 04:30:58.244
TRAVIS: Fuck!

04:30:59.255 --> 04:31:00.191
MARISHA: Need a Hail Mary.

04:31:00.191 --> 04:31:03.371
LIAM: Cut off the head of the snake.

04:31:03.371 --> 04:31:05.371
TRAVIS: Yeah. All right. I will--

04:31:06.959 --> 04:31:08.411
I'm going to cast--

04:31:09.601 --> 04:31:10.794
None of this is good.

04:31:11.741 --> 04:31:13.471
I'm going to cast Far Step

04:31:14.441 --> 04:31:16.191
with my bonus action.

04:31:16.191 --> 04:31:17.024
MATT: Okay.

04:31:17.024 --> 04:31:20.914
TRAVIS: I'm going to appear on the opposite side of Lucien.

04:31:22.121 --> 04:31:23.431
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: 60 feet.

04:31:23.431 --> 04:31:26.656
Yeah, I'll walk however close I need to bamf

04:31:26.656 --> 04:31:28.451
60 feet on the opposite side of Lucien.

04:31:28.451 --> 04:31:30.111
MATT: You're on the opposite side of Lucien.

04:31:30.111 --> 04:31:32.081
TRAVIS: And I am going to...

04:31:33.651 --> 04:31:37.913
Grapple or hit? Grapple or hit? Grapple or hit?

04:31:37.913 --> 04:31:39.663
LIAM: Where is that shit?

04:31:41.486 --> 04:31:42.319
MATT: What are you doing, buddy?

04:31:42.319 --> 04:31:45.381
TRAVIS: I'm going to hit. Two swings, Star Razor.

04:31:45.381 --> 04:31:46.472
MATT: Okay.

04:31:46.472 --> 04:31:47.761
He's going to go ahead and use his reaction

04:31:47.761 --> 04:31:50.344
to use Blood Curse of the Eyeless.

04:31:51.963 --> 04:31:53.361
He takes some damage on that.

04:31:53.361 --> 04:31:54.194
LIAM: There you are.

04:31:54.194 --> 04:31:56.191
MATT: And all of your attacks have disadvantage.

04:31:56.191 --> 04:31:58.441
TRAVIS: Boy, that is unfortunate.

04:32:01.771 --> 04:32:03.350
Six plus--

04:32:03.350 --> 04:32:04.183
13.

04:32:05.141 --> 04:32:06.251
That's 19 to hit?

04:32:06.251 --> 04:32:07.211
MATT: Misses.

04:32:07.211 --> 04:32:08.044
SAM: Damn it!

04:32:10.871 --> 04:32:12.501
TRAVIS: That is 11,

04:32:12.501 --> 04:32:14.161
24 to hit?

04:32:14.161 --> 04:32:15.521
MATT: 24 hits.

04:32:15.521 --> 04:32:16.354
TRAVIS: Okay.

04:32:16.354 --> 04:32:17.210
MARISHA: Lucien?

04:32:17.210 --> 04:32:18.605
MATT: Mm-hmm.

04:32:21.924 --> 04:32:24.271
TRAVIS: All right, that's good.

04:32:24.271 --> 04:32:26.611
Plus eight, 17.

04:32:26.611 --> 04:32:28.734
He's not cursed in any way.

04:32:30.671 --> 04:32:32.891
Yeah, 17 points

04:32:34.954 --> 04:32:35.881
of force damage.

04:32:35.881 --> 04:32:36.714
MATT: Okay.

04:32:39.021 --> 04:32:39.854
That's your attack?

04:32:39.854 --> 04:32:41.851
TRAVIS: That is my turn.

04:32:41.851 --> 04:32:42.684
MATT: Okay, end of your turn,

04:32:42.684 --> 04:32:45.501
he's going to use a legendary action to take a swing at you

04:32:45.501 --> 04:32:49.129
with one of his scimitars. (whooshing)

04:32:49.129 --> 04:32:50.129
Just like not even looking at you,

04:32:50.129 --> 04:32:51.227
just strikes behind.

04:32:51.227 --> 04:32:52.259
TALIESIN: Fuck, man.

04:32:53.425 --> 04:32:57.393
MATT: That is going to be a 20 to hit.

04:32:57.393 --> 04:32:59.218
TRAVIS: Hits.
MATT: That hits, okay.

04:32:59.218 --> 04:33:02.011
LIAM: My only plan is to Hail Mary.

04:33:02.011 --> 04:33:02.996
MATT: You take...

04:33:02.996 --> 04:33:05.521
LIAM: (sighing)

04:33:05.521 --> 04:33:07.431
MARISHA: Yours is, or isn't?

04:33:07.431 --> 04:33:08.871
MATT: 14 points of slashing damage

04:33:08.871 --> 04:33:11.239
and 10 points of psychic damage from the strike.

04:33:11.239 --> 04:33:12.072
TRAVIS: Okay.

04:33:12.072 --> 04:33:15.071
MATT: Also, as the slice cuts through your chest,

04:33:15.071 --> 04:33:18.811
you watch as the blood suddenly glows red in a symbol.

04:33:18.811 --> 04:33:21.441
This arcane symbol burns into your chest,

04:33:21.441 --> 04:33:22.461
beneath the armor.

04:33:22.461 --> 04:33:24.264
It glows through for a minute, and you're like, "Augh!"

04:33:24.264 --> 04:33:26.811
And you feel this searing sensation in your chest,

04:33:26.811 --> 04:33:28.441
and the glow is just staying there

04:33:28.441 --> 04:33:29.851
through the armor.

04:33:29.851 --> 04:33:33.221
You've been branded or marked in some way.

04:33:33.221 --> 04:33:35.368
TRAVIS: Cool.
SAM: Cool, cool.

04:33:35.368 --> 04:33:36.870
ASHLEY: Cool, cool, cool.

04:33:36.870 --> 04:33:38.394
TRAVIS: Good stuff.
SAM: Going great.

04:33:38.394 --> 04:33:40.280
MATT: So that's your turn, Fjord?
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

04:33:40.280 --> 04:33:41.460
MATT: All right.

04:33:41.460 --> 04:33:45.091
Zoran's going to go ahead and move over to here to flank.

04:33:45.091 --> 04:33:47.002
SAM: We're trying to just get out of here.

04:33:47.002 --> 04:33:48.301
MARISHA: We got to get the fuck out of here.

04:33:48.301 --> 04:33:49.919
SAM: Fjord can get out of here.
MATT: He has advantage against you because he's

04:33:49.919 --> 04:33:51.048
flanking with Lucien.

04:33:52.141 --> 04:33:52.974
SAM: Fjord can bamf.

04:33:52.974 --> 04:33:54.497
MATT: Yeah, that's 27.

04:33:54.497 --> 04:33:55.629
TRAVIS: Yeah, it hits.

04:33:55.629 --> 04:33:57.424
TALIESIN: Does he have night vision?

04:33:59.591 --> 04:34:00.531
MATT: He doesn't need it.

04:34:00.531 --> 04:34:01.871
TALIESIN: Fuck.

04:34:01.871 --> 04:34:03.041
Trying everything.

04:34:03.041 --> 04:34:04.051
MATT: I know, I know.

04:34:04.051 --> 04:34:05.034
TALIESIN: Trying fucking everything.

04:34:05.034 --> 04:34:07.831
MATT: The first one hits; the second one is a 19.

04:34:07.831 --> 04:34:08.721
TRAVIS: That is my armor class.

04:34:08.721 --> 04:34:10.071
MATT: So it does hit, all right.

04:34:10.071 --> 04:34:10.904
TALIESIN: Fuck.

04:34:12.801 --> 04:34:13.634
MATT: So you take

04:34:15.371 --> 04:34:17.191
11 points of bludgeoning damage,

04:34:17.191 --> 04:34:18.386
plus four points of fire.

04:34:18.386 --> 04:34:20.052
TRAVIS: Okay.

04:34:20.052 --> 04:34:23.549
MATT: And 13 points of bludgeoning damage,

04:34:23.549 --> 04:34:24.561
and two points of fire.

04:34:24.561 --> 04:34:25.831
TRAVIS: Okay.

04:34:25.831 --> 04:34:27.498
MATT: That's Zoran's go.

04:34:29.201 --> 04:34:31.191
He's going to action surge.

04:34:31.191 --> 04:34:34.857
LIAM: Is the battlefield still semi-illuminated by flame?

04:34:34.857 --> 04:34:36.021
MATT: Yes, a little bit, around them.

04:34:36.021 --> 04:34:37.829
LIAM: Okay.
TRAVIS: And my Star Razor--

04:34:37.829 --> 04:34:38.921
MATT: Zoran's going to action surge,

04:34:38.921 --> 04:34:40.961
and he's going to go ahead and strike

04:34:40.961 --> 04:34:43.864
against you two more times with advantage.

04:34:44.891 --> 04:34:45.724
That hits.

04:34:48.021 --> 04:34:49.271
And yeah, they both hit.

04:34:49.271 --> 04:34:50.974
TRAVIS: I forgot to roll d12s.

04:34:52.201 --> 04:34:53.639
He takes...

04:34:53.639 --> 04:34:54.564
Oh, it's nine.

04:34:54.564 --> 04:34:55.589
LIAM: This is FUBAR.

04:34:55.589 --> 04:34:57.881
TRAVIS: He takes 13 points of radiant damage.

04:34:57.881 --> 04:34:58.812
MATT: Good call.
MARISHA: Stay cool.

04:34:58.812 --> 04:34:59.645
Stay calm.
TRAVIS: In those first two.

04:34:59.645 --> 04:35:00.478
SAM: You got this.

04:35:00.478 --> 04:35:02.651
MARISHA: We got this.
TRAVIS: Oh.

04:35:02.651 --> 04:35:05.371
He takes 13 points of radiant damage.

04:35:05.371 --> 04:35:08.398
And I will teleport 15 feet away.

04:35:08.398 --> 04:35:09.451
MARISHA: Hell, yes.
MATT: Oh shit.

04:35:09.451 --> 04:35:10.421
MARISHA: Hell, yes.

04:35:10.421 --> 04:35:11.254
MATT: Where are you going?

04:35:11.254 --> 04:35:16.033
TRAVIS: I will make them chase me.

04:35:16.033 --> 04:35:16.866
MARISHA: Yasha, how fast are you?

04:35:16.866 --> 04:35:18.084
MATT: That way?
MARISHA: You're fast too, right?

04:35:18.084 --> 04:35:19.250
ASHLEY: I'm fast. 50 feet.

04:35:19.250 --> 04:35:21.211
SAM: Who took damage? Lucien?
MARISHA: We can help

04:35:21.211 --> 04:35:23.610
drag these slow pokes.
MATT: Okay.

04:35:23.610 --> 04:35:26.211
TRAVIS: So really, let's say those first two hit,

04:35:26.211 --> 04:35:27.821
because I would've teleported after the first one.

04:35:27.821 --> 04:35:30.121
So maybe the action surge you want to bring back,

04:35:30.121 --> 04:35:31.096
or do you want to have him come to me

04:35:31.096 --> 04:35:33.304
and use the action surge?

04:35:33.304 --> 04:35:34.631
MATT: I don't know if he has enough movement to do that.

04:35:34.631 --> 04:35:35.464
TRAVIS: Okay.

04:35:35.464 --> 04:35:37.783
MARISHA: (exhaling)

04:35:37.783 --> 04:35:38.781
MATT: Yeah, he would.
MARISHA: But, yeah. You can--

04:35:38.781 --> 04:35:39.871
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MARISHA: Maybe go--

04:35:39.871 --> 04:35:41.131
MATT: He's going to come in and do with a two.

04:35:41.131 --> 04:35:42.797
So those both still hit.
SAM: Did you deal damage to the big guy?

04:35:42.797 --> 04:35:44.516
MATT: So that's still nine points of bludgeoning.

04:35:44.516 --> 04:35:47.321
TALIESIN: They wouldn't have had advantage.

04:35:47.321 --> 04:35:49.321
MARISHA: Caleb or Caduceus, either/or.

04:35:49.321 --> 04:35:50.221
MATT: That's true.
TALIESIN: Thank you.

04:35:50.221 --> 04:35:52.221
MATT: So good call on that.

04:35:52.221 --> 04:35:53.641
Re-rolling those attacks.

04:35:53.641 --> 04:35:55.307
That hits.

04:35:55.307 --> 04:35:57.211
That is a 17,

04:35:57.211 --> 04:35:58.044
which I think misses.

04:35:58.044 --> 04:35:58.877
TRAVIS: It does miss.

04:35:58.877 --> 04:36:01.501
TALIESIN: (exhales) One less.
MATT: So you take

04:36:01.501 --> 04:36:02.741
15 points of bludgeoning damage,

04:36:02.741 --> 04:36:05.111
and one point of fire damage.

04:36:05.111 --> 04:36:08.361
TRAVIS: Cool, he takes another nine?

04:36:08.361 --> 04:36:09.851
Nine points of radiant damage.

04:36:09.851 --> 04:36:14.018
And I will teleport another 15 feet away from him.

04:36:17.659 --> 04:36:18.909
LAURA: That's tight.

04:36:20.141 --> 04:36:20.974
TRAVIS: Kind of tight.

04:36:20.974 --> 04:36:23.915
LIAM: (whispering) I don't know if
we're all going to get out of here.

04:36:23.915 --> 04:36:26.498
TRAVIS: I wanted Lucien's eye, though.

04:36:30.919 --> 04:36:33.134
MATT: Probably should specify that. I'm pretty sure the--

04:36:33.134 --> 04:36:34.101
TRAVIS: Is it only a one-time thing?

04:36:34.101 --> 04:36:36.074
MATT: I think the teleport away is like--

04:36:37.581 --> 04:36:39.151
TRAVIS: "In addition, whenever a creature within five feet

04:36:39.151 --> 04:36:40.101
"hits you with a melee attack,

04:36:40.101 --> 04:36:40.934
"the sword bursts--

04:36:40.934 --> 04:36:42.761
"1d12 radiant damage to the attacker--

04:36:42.761 --> 04:36:44.301
"You can use your reaction--"

04:36:44.301 --> 04:36:45.378
It only happens once.
MATT: Yeah, I was going to say.

04:36:45.378 --> 04:36:46.928
There's limitations. So you do it once.

04:36:48.231 --> 04:36:49.592
MARISHA: But we want to get them--

04:36:49.592 --> 04:36:51.975
MATT: All right, so that finishes Zoran's go.

04:36:51.975 --> 04:36:53.310
MARISHA: Because the cone is--

04:36:53.310 --> 04:36:55.227
MATT: Yasha, you're up, with Beau.

04:36:55.227 --> 04:36:56.849
MARISHA: -- that way.

04:36:56.849 --> 04:36:57.841
ASHLEY: (exhales)

04:36:57.841 --> 04:36:59.182
Okay.

04:36:59.182 --> 04:37:00.761
SAM: Does he have that fucking pouch or not?

04:37:00.761 --> 04:37:01.861
MARISHA: Is it Yasha and Beau at the same--?

04:37:01.861 --> 04:37:02.819
No, she goes first, right?

04:37:02.819 --> 04:37:03.911
MATT: Yeah, Yasha, you're up first.

04:37:03.911 --> 04:37:05.781
TRAVIS: Has everybody looked to see if it's on Lucien?

04:37:05.781 --> 04:37:08.641
SAM: I can't waste a whole action looking.

04:37:08.641 --> 04:37:09.949
ASHLEY: Okay, so we don't

04:37:09.949 --> 04:37:11.331
know where the cone--
TRAVIS: Would it be an action to see if

04:37:11.331 --> 04:37:14.011
the bag of holding is hanging off of Lucien anywhere?

04:37:14.011 --> 04:37:16.484
MATT: In this darkness and this chaos, yeah.

04:37:17.841 --> 04:37:18.674
I would--

04:37:21.074 --> 04:37:22.399
Well, continue.

04:37:22.399 --> 04:37:24.836
SAM: (laughs)

04:37:24.836 --> 04:37:27.760
TRAVIS: Listen, we'd love out of this fight, trust me.

04:37:27.760 --> 04:37:28.611
MATT: All right, Yasha.

04:37:28.611 --> 04:37:29.881
You're up.

04:37:29.881 --> 04:37:31.400
SAM: Oh boy.
LIAM: Yeah.

04:37:31.400 --> 04:37:32.491
SAM: Haven't gotten one of those in a while.
MARISHA: What was that?

04:37:32.491 --> 04:37:34.924
LAURA: Him going, "Get the fuck out
or you're all going to die."

04:37:34.924 --> 04:37:39.707
SAM: That's Matt being worried for us as friends. (laughs)

04:37:39.707 --> 04:37:41.711
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.

04:37:41.711 --> 04:37:44.421
MARISHA: The cone is basically his eye line.

04:37:44.421 --> 04:37:45.254
ASHLEY: His eye line.

04:37:45.254 --> 04:37:47.351
MARISHA: Yeah. It's wherever his eyeballs are facing.

04:37:47.351 --> 04:37:51.471
ASHLEY: But I wonder if I grab Caleb.

04:37:51.471 --> 04:37:52.304
MARISHA: Uh huh.
SAM: You can

04:37:52.304 --> 04:37:53.503
physically grab anything.

04:37:53.503 --> 04:37:55.121
It's just magic that's canceled.

04:37:55.121 --> 04:37:57.641
MARISHA: Yeah, and just drag his ass.

04:37:57.641 --> 04:37:59.601
ASHLEY: Are my--

04:37:59.601 --> 04:38:01.653
SAM: -- muscles magic?

04:38:01.653 --> 04:38:03.861
ASHLEY: They're very-- they're so magical.

04:38:07.343 --> 04:38:09.141
The wings.

04:38:09.141 --> 04:38:10.816
MATT: Yes?
ASHLEY: Is that magical

04:38:10.816 --> 04:38:12.411
or is that just a part of

04:38:13.464 --> 04:38:14.464
who I am?

04:38:16.391 --> 04:38:17.270
MATT: You don't know.

04:38:17.270 --> 04:38:19.391
That's something to find out.
TRAVIS: (laughs)

04:38:19.391 --> 04:38:20.612
MARISHA: The wings, is that what you're saying?

04:38:20.612 --> 04:38:21.445
ASHLEY: Yeah.

04:38:22.689 --> 04:38:24.903
Can (whooshing)

04:38:24.903 --> 04:38:27.901
MARISHA: I don't know.
SAM: How do they feel?

04:38:27.901 --> 04:38:28.734
ASHLEY: Okay.

04:38:30.411 --> 04:38:32.551
MARISHA: I guess if they go away, you still have your legs.

04:38:32.551 --> 04:38:33.541
ASHLEY: If they go away, they go way.

04:38:33.541 --> 04:38:34.754
MARISHA: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Okay.

04:38:36.381 --> 04:38:39.104
MATT: You would say they are built of divine energy,

04:38:40.221 --> 04:38:42.938
which might inform a little bit.

04:38:44.231 --> 04:38:45.064
TALIESIN: Shit.

04:38:45.905 --> 04:38:47.519
ASHLEY: That means, that's probably--
LAURA: You're magic.

04:38:47.519 --> 04:38:48.352
ASHLEY: Yeah.

04:38:48.352 --> 04:38:49.185
SAM: Oh boy.

04:38:49.185 --> 04:38:50.890
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

04:38:50.890 --> 04:38:52.271
How far am I?

04:38:52.271 --> 04:38:54.021
I'm so sorry, this is so stressful.

04:38:55.041 --> 04:38:57.513
How far am I

04:38:57.513 --> 04:38:58.437
to Caleb and Caduceus?

04:38:58.437 --> 04:39:00.164
MATT: You're about 30 feet from Caleb.

04:39:01.881 --> 04:39:03.547
ASHLEY: Okay.
LIAM: Fuck.

04:39:03.547 --> 04:39:06.426
ASHLEY: I am going to

04:39:07.381 --> 04:39:08.581
run over to Caleb.

04:39:08.581 --> 04:39:10.291
LIAM: (groans)
MATT: Okay.

04:39:10.291 --> 04:39:11.416
So that's 30 feet.

04:39:12.261 --> 04:39:13.241
ASHLEY: That's all I got so far.

04:39:13.241 --> 04:39:14.644
Give me a second.

04:39:14.644 --> 04:39:16.011
Okay, so from there--

04:39:16.961 --> 04:39:17.794
TALIESIN: Shit.

04:39:19.861 --> 04:39:21.871
ASHLEY: Ooh, I'm going to just bamf out my wings

04:39:21.871 --> 04:39:24.129
and try to grab them and fly away and see what happens.

04:39:24.129 --> 04:39:25.211
This is so stupid.

04:39:25.211 --> 04:39:26.401
LIAM: Where we are is no good.

04:39:26.401 --> 04:39:27.434
ASHLEY: Where we are is still no good

04:39:27.434 --> 04:39:28.491
because you already tried it.

04:39:28.491 --> 04:39:29.324
LIAM: Yep.

04:39:29.324 --> 04:39:30.157
ASHLEY: Okay.
SAM: Yep.

04:39:30.157 --> 04:39:31.823
LAURA: You might be just out of it now, though.

04:39:31.823 --> 04:39:33.241
You're five feet further.

04:39:33.241 --> 04:39:35.031
ASHLEY: I'm five feet further, so...

04:39:35.031 --> 04:39:36.381
LIAM: Yeah, you are, technically.

04:39:36.381 --> 04:39:37.441
MATT: So you spend an action--

04:39:37.441 --> 04:39:38.274
LIAM: A hair further.

04:39:38.274 --> 04:39:39.851
MATT: -- to do this, are you doing it or not?

04:39:40.691 --> 04:39:42.001
ASHLEY: No, you already--

04:39:42.001 --> 04:39:43.057
I feel like you gave me a clue.

04:39:43.057 --> 04:39:45.764
MATT: No, I was answering your question.

04:39:45.764 --> 04:39:46.651
ASHLEY: Ugh!

04:39:46.651 --> 04:39:47.861
LAURA: Just do it.
ASHLEY: This is so stressful.

04:39:47.861 --> 04:39:49.223
LAURA: Use some magic, just do it.
MATT: It's D&amp;D; make a choice.

04:39:49.223 --> 04:39:50.491
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:39:50.491 --> 04:39:51.324
It's all right.

04:39:51.324 --> 04:39:54.051
If it's a TPK, it is fucking amazing.

04:39:54.051 --> 04:39:56.397
ASHLEY: All right, the wings are coming out.

04:39:56.397 --> 04:39:57.230
MATT: (whoosh)

04:39:57.230 --> 04:39:58.201
LAURA: (gasps)

04:39:58.201 --> 04:40:01.331
MATT: They emerge, brightening the space around you.

04:40:01.331 --> 04:40:03.084
You appear to be on the outskirts

04:40:03.084 --> 04:40:04.481
of this area.
MARISHA: Oh my god.

04:40:04.481 --> 04:40:06.209
You are five feet in the clear.

04:40:06.209 --> 04:40:07.042
SAM: Yeah.

04:40:07.042 --> 04:40:08.121
MARISHA: Oh my god.

04:40:08.121 --> 04:40:09.111
MATT: And you have Caleb there.

04:40:09.111 --> 04:40:09.944
It's your action to do that.

04:40:09.944 --> 04:40:10.777
So you still have 20 feet of movement.

04:40:10.777 --> 04:40:11.971
Because you have flight,

04:40:11.971 --> 04:40:14.171
I'll say I'll add an additional 30 feet of movement

04:40:14.171 --> 04:40:15.479
with your wings, if you want to.

04:40:15.479 --> 04:40:16.801
So you have 50 feet a movement with your wings.

04:40:16.801 --> 04:40:18.991
ASHLEY: Okay, so I will grab him.

04:40:18.991 --> 04:40:20.825
I will grab Caleb and just

04:40:20.825 --> 04:40:21.658
(whoosh)

04:40:21.658 --> 04:40:25.081
towards this way,

04:40:25.081 --> 04:40:27.458
Jester, owl, and yeah.

04:40:27.458 --> 04:40:28.711
MATT: That will get you about there.

04:40:28.711 --> 04:40:31.176
ASHLEY: Okay, and still just floaties.

04:40:31.176 --> 04:40:32.911
Floaties with Caleb.

04:40:32.911 --> 04:40:34.344
MATT: Correct.
LIAM: Oh shit. That changes everything.

04:40:34.344 --> 04:40:35.402
ASHLEY: Does it? Is it bad?

04:40:35.402 --> 04:40:36.452
LIAM: It doesn't matter.

04:40:36.452 --> 04:40:37.924
MARISHA: We got this, we got this.

04:40:37.924 --> 04:40:39.644
Don't lose hope, man!

04:40:40.511 --> 04:40:42.141
LIAM: I just have to think of new ideas.

04:40:42.141 --> 04:40:43.271
SAM: Caduceus is a lost cause.

04:40:43.271 --> 04:40:44.285
Let's go.

04:40:44.285 --> 04:40:45.281
LAURA: No!
(laughter)

04:40:45.281 --> 04:40:46.114
LIAM: No, we did that already.

04:40:46.114 --> 04:40:47.394
SAM: Let's get out of here.
LIAM: That happened

04:40:47.394 --> 04:40:48.431
in episode 20-something.

04:40:48.431 --> 04:40:49.264
MATT: That's you right there.

04:40:49.264 --> 04:40:50.461
All right, that finishes Yasha's go.

04:40:50.461 --> 04:40:51.294
Beau, what are you doing?

04:40:51.294 --> 04:40:54.224
MARISHA: Okay, I am jogging over.

04:40:56.111 --> 04:40:57.777
SAM: Good, don't, don't--

04:40:57.777 --> 04:40:58.861
LAURA: Don't go t--

04:40:58.861 --> 04:41:00.218
SAM: Don't go too far away!

04:41:00.218 --> 04:41:01.591
MARISHA: I'm going to go get Caduceus.

04:41:01.591 --> 04:41:02.424
Calm down.

04:41:02.424 --> 04:41:03.361
TALIESIN: (whimpers)

04:41:03.361 --> 04:41:05.011
MARISHA: I am going to move--

04:41:05.011 --> 04:41:06.594
I just want to move

04:41:10.062 --> 04:41:12.601
over here in this pocket,

04:41:12.601 --> 04:41:13.601
like in this angle.

04:41:13.601 --> 04:41:16.361
Not too close. I want to be 30 feet away from--

04:41:17.231 --> 04:41:18.321
To go here-ish.

04:41:18.321 --> 04:41:19.154
Does that-- you see?

04:41:19.154 --> 04:41:20.241
MATT: Where, here?

04:41:20.241 --> 04:41:21.089
MARISHA: Yep, yep.

04:41:21.089 --> 04:41:21.922
Is that--?

04:41:21.922 --> 04:41:23.171
TALIESIN: You have six hit points.

04:41:23.171 --> 04:41:24.004
What are you doing?

04:41:24.004 --> 04:41:25.361
MARISHA: I don't have six hit points.

04:41:25.361 --> 04:41:26.194
Calm down.

04:41:26.194 --> 04:41:27.391
I'm going to go right here.

04:41:27.391 --> 04:41:28.982
LIAM: Nobody's calm.
MATT: Between them? Right there?

04:41:28.982 --> 04:41:30.048
MARISHA: Yes.
LIAM: Oh my god.

04:41:30.048 --> 04:41:31.763
LAURA: What?
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait.

04:41:31.763 --> 04:41:33.331
LAURA: Beau!
MARISHA: Wait a minute!

04:41:33.331 --> 04:41:34.164
I want to go back a little.

04:41:34.164 --> 04:41:36.305
Am I 30 feet away from

04:41:38.856 --> 04:41:39.689
Lucien?

04:41:39.689 --> 04:41:40.711
MATT: This is Tyffial.

04:41:40.711 --> 04:41:42.902
MARISHA: I know. I want to be--
MATT: No, you are more than 30 feet.

04:41:42.902 --> 04:41:44.627
MARISHA: I want to move here,

04:41:44.627 --> 04:41:46.031
beside Tyffial,

04:41:46.031 --> 04:41:48.921
and would that maybe put me within-ish 30 feet?

04:41:48.921 --> 04:41:49.993
MATT: Oh yeah, you'd be within

04:41:49.993 --> 04:41:51.691
30 feet over here.
MARISHA: That's what I want. That's what I want.

04:41:51.691 --> 04:41:52.601
MATT: Okay.

04:41:52.601 --> 04:41:55.961
MARISHA: And I want to take out my Belabor,

04:41:55.961 --> 04:41:59.071
aiming it towards Mollymauk,

04:41:59.071 --> 04:42:00.101
and I'm going to--

04:42:00.101 --> 04:42:02.011
MATT: Or Lucien.
MARISHA: Lucien, yeah.

04:42:02.011 --> 04:42:04.561
LIAM: Right, purple guy.
MARISHA: Purple guy.

04:42:04.561 --> 04:42:07.231
And I'm going to take my staff

04:42:07.231 --> 04:42:09.641
and I want to expend one of the charges

04:42:09.641 --> 04:42:11.181
to do my big--

04:42:11.181 --> 04:42:12.411
I don't know,

04:42:12.411 --> 04:42:15.031
spin it overhead as I gather energy

04:42:15.031 --> 04:42:18.089
and I'm going to sweep it in a big arc towards him,

04:42:18.089 --> 04:42:20.931
and I want to do my--

04:42:22.517 --> 04:42:23.801
And it doesn't have an ability.

04:42:23.801 --> 04:42:27.369
I want to send an arc towards Lucien.

04:42:27.369 --> 04:42:28.202
MATT: Okay.

04:42:28.202 --> 04:42:30.371
MARISHA: Anyone within five feet of him

04:42:30.371 --> 04:42:34.711
have to make a DC 15 strength saving throw.

04:42:34.711 --> 04:42:36.201
MATT: Okay.

04:42:36.201 --> 04:42:39.071
So Lucien and Cree will be hit by this.

04:42:39.071 --> 04:42:39.904
MARISHA: Great.

04:42:39.904 --> 04:42:40.991
MATT: All right, so Lucien

04:42:43.604 --> 04:42:46.000
does not succeed on the saving throw.

04:42:46.000 --> 04:42:48.441
He'll use a legendary resistance to succeed.

04:42:48.441 --> 04:42:49.601
MARISHA: He has them?

04:42:49.601 --> 04:42:50.434
LAURA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

04:42:50.434 --> 04:42:51.267
LAURA: Yeah.

04:42:51.267 --> 04:42:53.424
MATT: And then Cree makes her save.

04:42:54.291 --> 04:42:55.124
MARISHA: Okay.

04:42:55.124 --> 04:42:56.691
SAM: Is it one or three, or two?

04:42:56.691 --> 04:42:57.524
LAURA: Three.
MARISHA: Okay.

04:42:57.524 --> 04:43:00.881
TALIESIN: Gets them back with a short rest, I imagine.

04:43:00.881 --> 04:43:03.711
MARISHA: Well, they, I guess,

04:43:03.711 --> 04:43:06.671
they suffer half damage still of 3d8 force damage.

04:43:06.671 --> 04:43:07.504
MATT: Okay.

04:43:07.504 --> 04:43:08.770
TALIESIN: I think short rest brought back

04:43:08.770 --> 04:43:10.318
the legendary actions.

04:43:10.318 --> 04:43:12.178
TRAVIS: He only used one before anyway, so.

04:43:12.178 --> 04:43:14.186
TALIESIN: One or two? Yeah, he used one.

04:43:16.281 --> 04:43:17.464
MARISHA: Okay.

04:43:17.464 --> 04:43:18.324
What is that?

04:43:18.324 --> 04:43:20.301
A two, eight, nine, 10,

04:43:20.301 --> 04:43:21.271
16 force.

04:43:21.271 --> 04:43:22.104
No, sorry.

04:43:22.104 --> 04:43:25.326
That's 16 total, halved.

04:43:25.326 --> 04:43:26.841
So eight force damage.

04:43:26.841 --> 04:43:27.899
MATT: Eight to both. You got it.

04:43:27.899 --> 04:43:29.241
LIAM: So you're attacking Luci?

04:43:29.241 --> 04:43:31.111
MATT: Both get blasted back a little bit.

04:43:31.111 --> 04:43:32.551
MARISHA: I was trying to push them back 15 feet,

04:43:32.551 --> 04:43:33.384
and it didn't work.

04:43:33.384 --> 04:43:35.511
He failed and then saved,

04:43:35.511 --> 04:43:36.344
and then she saved.

04:43:36.344 --> 04:43:37.177
MATT: So that's your action.

04:43:37.177 --> 04:43:38.731
You moved about,

04:43:38.731 --> 04:43:40.121
from where you were, 15 feet.

04:43:40.121 --> 04:43:41.631
So you still have the rest of your movements.

04:43:41.631 --> 04:43:44.571
MARISHA: Can I do Step of the Wind, grab Caduceus,

04:43:44.571 --> 04:43:46.611
and start dragging his ass back?

04:43:46.611 --> 04:43:48.391
MATT: Sure, we'll say it's 20 feet to get to him.

04:43:48.391 --> 04:43:49.662
MARISHA: Yep.
MATT: So 15, 20,

04:43:49.662 --> 04:43:50.883
so that's 35 feet you've used.

04:43:50.883 --> 04:43:51.901
How much more movement do you have?

04:43:51.901 --> 04:43:53.573
MARISHA: And then, Step of the Wind for my bonus action.

04:43:53.573 --> 04:43:54.791
MATT: How much more movement do you have

04:43:54.791 --> 04:43:55.624
before Step of the Wind?

04:43:55.624 --> 04:43:56.801
MARISHA: Oh, well, I have 50 feet total.

04:43:56.801 --> 04:43:57.959
So 30.
MATT: All right. So 15 feet,

04:43:57.959 --> 04:43:59.499
you move him back that far,

04:43:59.499 --> 04:44:00.361
and then you can use Step of the Wind

04:44:00.361 --> 04:44:02.091
to move him another 25 feet.

04:44:02.091 --> 04:44:03.122
MARISHA: Let's do it.

04:44:03.122 --> 04:44:04.251
MATT: Okay, that'll get you about there.

04:44:04.251 --> 04:44:06.821
MARISHA: We're at least all together now.

04:44:06.821 --> 04:44:07.654
Yes?
SAM: That's good.

04:44:07.654 --> 04:44:09.031
LAURA: Okay, okay.
MATT: Okay.

04:44:09.031 --> 04:44:11.035
MARISHA: Now, that's--

04:44:11.035 --> 04:44:13.311
LAURA: Until he turns toward us. (laughs)

04:44:13.311 --> 04:44:14.891
MARISHA: That's it, but we're all together now.

04:44:14.891 --> 04:44:16.601
So whatever the fuck we need to do,

04:44:16.601 --> 04:44:18.481
if we need to bamf back to your house.

04:44:18.481 --> 04:44:20.531
MATT: Well, you're all together, except for Fjord.

04:44:20.531 --> 04:44:21.364
LIAM: Yeah, Fjord.

04:44:21.364 --> 04:44:22.896
LAURA: Fjord is on the there side of the field.

04:44:22.896 --> 04:44:23.836
MARISHA: Fuck!

04:44:23.836 --> 04:44:25.082
TRAVIS: Just do it.

04:44:25.082 --> 04:44:25.938
LIAM: (grunting)

04:44:25.938 --> 04:44:26.771
MARISHA: Fuck.

04:44:26.771 --> 04:44:27.604
TRAVIS: Do it.

04:44:29.151 --> 04:44:29.984
Numbers.

04:44:29.984 --> 04:44:31.271
Numbers game.
MARISHA: I'm done.

04:44:31.271 --> 04:44:32.420
I'm done. That's my turn.

04:44:32.420 --> 04:44:34.128
I've got everybody there.

04:44:34.128 --> 04:44:34.961
That's all I got.

04:44:34.961 --> 04:44:35.794
TALIESIN: Get everybody home.

04:44:35.794 --> 04:44:37.261
LAURA: We can't get everybody home.

04:44:37.261 --> 04:44:39.121
I don't have a 6th-level spell anymore.

04:44:39.121 --> 04:44:40.323
I can't do it.

04:44:40.323 --> 04:44:42.823
So the most we can get is six people out

04:44:43.681 --> 04:44:46.056
with Caduceus.

04:44:46.936 --> 04:44:48.686
SAM: Or we can just run.

04:44:50.761 --> 04:44:51.891
TRAVIS: If they don't chase.

04:44:51.891 --> 04:44:53.621
LAURA: They will chase, but.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

04:44:53.621 --> 04:44:55.905
LIAM: But we've got three people on foot.

04:44:55.905 --> 04:44:58.451
Even if we were to damn Fjord to die,

04:44:58.451 --> 04:45:00.401
we have three people on foot.

04:45:00.401 --> 04:45:02.861
LAURA: We can both polymorph somebody.

04:45:02.861 --> 04:45:04.521
Well, you can polymorph.
LIAM: You can't polymorph from--

04:45:04.521 --> 04:45:05.681
I can, one,

04:45:05.681 --> 04:45:08.011
me or one of them,

04:45:08.011 --> 04:45:08.871
to pick one of...

04:45:08.871 --> 04:45:09.761
Maybe.

04:45:09.761 --> 04:45:11.611
SAM: Me and Beau are super fast.

04:45:11.611 --> 04:45:14.361
MARISHA: I could honestly move at competitive speed

04:45:14.361 --> 04:45:15.311
towards the owls.

04:45:15.311 --> 04:45:16.647
I have 50 feet of movement.

04:45:16.647 --> 04:45:18.481
MATT: Well regardless, Veth, it's your turn.

04:45:18.481 --> 04:45:19.314
SAM: It's my turn!

04:45:19.314 --> 04:45:20.530
MATT: Yeah.
SAM: What happened to Caleb?

04:45:20.530 --> 04:45:22.141
LAURA: Caleb, is after you.
MATT: Caleb is last.

04:45:22.141 --> 04:45:23.666
SAM: Oh, really? Oh, that's right.

04:45:23.666 --> 04:45:24.640
It flipped last time.
MATT: Well, it's Tyffial,

04:45:24.640 --> 04:45:25.531
and then it's Caleb.

04:45:25.531 --> 04:45:26.364
SAM: Shit.

04:45:26.364 --> 04:45:27.197
Shit.

04:45:27.197 --> 04:45:28.030
LIAM: What's your wing speed?

04:45:28.030 --> 04:45:29.851
MARISHA: Do you have anything to Dimension Door?

04:45:29.851 --> 04:45:30.684
ASHLEY: But I have 50--

04:45:30.684 --> 04:45:32.361
MARISHA: Okay, okay.

04:45:32.361 --> 04:45:33.784
ASHLEY: If I'm on the ground,

04:45:35.051 --> 04:45:35.884
I have 50.

04:45:35.884 --> 04:45:38.218
SAM: I'm so useless in this fight.

04:45:38.218 --> 04:45:39.800
SAM: I can't move anyone, I can't heal anyone.

04:45:39.800 --> 04:45:40.633
MARISHA: He can still bamf.

04:45:40.633 --> 04:45:42.211
We just need to fucking go.

04:45:42.211 --> 04:45:43.201
SAM: Yeah, I can run,

04:45:43.201 --> 04:45:46.801
but as soon as he turns his head, we're fucked.

04:45:46.801 --> 04:45:48.231
Is it a concentration?

04:45:48.231 --> 04:45:50.811
Should I try to break his concentration by just hitting him?

04:45:50.811 --> 04:45:52.071
LAURA: Hit him in the head.

04:45:52.071 --> 04:45:53.681
Shoot him in the head.

04:45:53.681 --> 04:45:55.344
MARISHA: I don't think--
TALIESIN: I think we fucking run.

04:45:55.344 --> 04:45:56.291
MARISHA: I don't think you can break it.

04:45:56.291 --> 04:45:57.751
It's in his tattoo.

04:45:57.751 --> 04:45:59.601
SAM: Yeah, I don't know that, though.

04:45:59.601 --> 04:46:00.434
TALIESIN: I think we fucking run.

04:46:00.434 --> 04:46:02.921
TRAVIS: Yeah, I hit him once, and I don't think it broke it.

04:46:02.921 --> 04:46:03.754
SAM: You did hit him?

04:46:03.754 --> 04:46:05.261
TRAVIS: I did hit him, but--
ASHLEY: How did the word get out?

04:46:05.261 --> 04:46:07.871
MARISHA: I technically just hit him with 3d8.

04:46:07.871 --> 04:46:09.061
LAURA: Abilities.

04:46:09.061 --> 04:46:09.894
ASHLEY: Okay.

04:46:10.851 --> 04:46:13.271
TALIESIN: So yeah, I think we just fucking run.

04:46:13.271 --> 04:46:16.391
I will definitely be saying: Run, run, run.

04:46:16.391 --> 04:46:18.905
MATT: What you doing, Veth?

04:46:18.905 --> 04:46:20.651
SAM: I can still run after I try something.

04:46:20.651 --> 04:46:22.601
So I will do that.

04:46:22.601 --> 04:46:24.125
I will--

04:46:24.125 --> 04:46:26.151
He's got legendary resistances.

04:46:26.151 --> 04:46:27.827
Fuck!

04:46:27.827 --> 04:46:31.761
I'll try Phantasmal Force on Lucien.

04:46:31.761 --> 04:46:32.594
MATT: Okay.

04:46:36.093 --> 04:46:37.991
LAURA: He's immune to psychic damage.

04:46:37.991 --> 04:46:39.712
SAM: It's not damage.

04:46:39.712 --> 04:46:40.551
LAURA: Okay.

04:46:40.551 --> 04:46:41.651
TRAVIS: He can't be charmed.

04:46:41.651 --> 04:46:43.051
SAM: It's not a charm.

04:46:43.051 --> 04:46:44.431
LIAM: Tal, did you move yourself?

04:46:44.431 --> 04:46:45.411
You got pulled over?

04:46:45.411 --> 04:46:47.511
TALIESIN: I haven't moved myself yet.

04:46:47.511 --> 04:46:49.781
SAM: It's an illusion that is in his mind.

04:46:49.781 --> 04:46:51.491
TALIESIN: We're close enough.
SAM: It's not a charm.

04:46:51.491 --> 04:46:53.061
MATT: So he has to make an intelligence saving throw.

04:46:53.061 --> 04:46:54.605
SAM: Yes.

04:46:56.321 --> 04:46:57.851
MATT: That is a 12.

04:46:57.851 --> 04:46:59.051
SAM: 16.

04:46:59.051 --> 04:46:59.884
MATT: Yeah.

04:47:01.591 --> 04:47:02.651
SAM: Okay.
MATT: What are you doing?

04:47:02.651 --> 04:47:03.484
MARISHA: Oh my god.

04:47:03.484 --> 04:47:05.421
SAM: He sees Caleb,

04:47:05.421 --> 04:47:06.744
the real Caleb,

04:47:09.221 --> 04:47:10.761
the other way.

04:47:10.761 --> 04:47:12.277
TRAVIS: Towards Matt?

04:47:12.277 --> 04:47:14.647
SAM: Yeah, it's hard for me to gauge, but--

04:47:14.647 --> 04:47:15.481
MATT: This direction?

04:47:15.481 --> 04:47:18.741
SAM: If he's looking forward, turn him left.

04:47:18.741 --> 04:47:22.491
MATT: All right, so fake Caleb we'll say is here, right?

04:47:22.491 --> 04:47:23.901
SAM: Yeah, that's the real Caleb,

04:47:23.901 --> 04:47:26.291
and the real Caleb is doing this

04:47:26.291 --> 04:47:30.441
and getting ready to cast a fucking amazing spell at him.

04:47:30.441 --> 04:47:31.274
MATT: Okay.

04:47:32.651 --> 04:47:33.484
Okay.

04:47:35.391 --> 04:47:36.371
That's your action.

04:47:36.371 --> 04:47:37.891
SAM: Then I will run.

04:47:37.891 --> 04:47:38.724
MATT: Which way?

04:47:38.724 --> 04:47:39.721
SAM: Away.

04:47:39.721 --> 04:47:41.081
MATT: Just away from everyone?

04:47:41.081 --> 04:47:43.101
SAM: Yeah.
MATT: All right.

04:47:43.101 --> 04:47:44.517
LAURA: Yeah, that's a good direction to go.

04:47:44.517 --> 04:47:46.031
MATT: Bonus action run as well?

04:47:46.031 --> 04:47:47.042
SAM: Sure.

04:47:47.042 --> 04:47:48.361
ASHLEY: This is so stressful.

04:47:48.361 --> 04:47:49.476
MARISHA: Yeah, that's it.

04:47:49.476 --> 04:47:51.499
Let's do this.

04:47:53.061 --> 04:47:55.011
MATT: Okay, ending your turn,

04:47:55.011 --> 04:47:57.614
that brings us to Tyffial's turn.

04:47:58.791 --> 04:48:00.374
Tyffial is going to go ahead and turn

04:48:00.374 --> 04:48:02.728
and head up towards Caduceus.

04:48:02.728 --> 04:48:04.481
And seeing you all gather up closely,

04:48:04.481 --> 04:48:05.431
is going to go ahead and take

04:48:06.954 --> 04:48:08.061
bonus action

04:48:08.061 --> 04:48:10.720
to once again, strike the blade across.

04:48:10.720 --> 04:48:13.291
The black tendrils appear again.

04:48:13.291 --> 04:48:16.111
Is going to go ahead and make two strikes against you.

04:48:16.111 --> 04:48:17.481
That is a 19 to hit.

04:48:17.481 --> 04:48:19.589
TALIESIN: It misses and I'm using shield of retribution.

04:48:19.589 --> 04:48:20.422
MATT: Okay.

04:48:20.422 --> 04:48:21.255
SAM: Ooh!

04:48:21.255 --> 04:48:22.878
Okay.

04:48:22.878 --> 04:48:24.164
That was a snarky miss.

04:48:24.164 --> 04:48:26.671
TALIESIN: "Blast with arcane force--"

04:48:26.671 --> 04:48:29.221
MATT: He's the master of snarky misses.

04:48:30.241 --> 04:48:31.271
TALIESIN: So--

04:48:31.271 --> 04:48:33.432
MATT: Nobody gives reactionary fuck yous like Taliesin does.

04:48:33.432 --> 04:48:34.265
(laughter)

04:48:34.265 --> 04:48:35.170
MATT: It's my favorite thing.

04:48:35.170 --> 04:48:37.289
TALIESIN: Thank you.

04:48:37.289 --> 04:48:38.316
MATT: Except when it's canceling a crit that I got.

04:48:38.316 --> 04:48:42.361
TALIESIN: 14 points of force damage.

04:48:42.361 --> 04:48:43.221
MATT: 14 points of force damage.

04:48:43.221 --> 04:48:46.446
TALIESIN: And make a strength saving throw.

04:48:46.446 --> 04:48:47.279
SAM: Oh boy.

04:48:48.341 --> 04:48:49.821
MATT: Pretty strong, but didn't roll great.

04:48:49.821 --> 04:48:51.831
A 14?
TALIESIN: Nope.

04:48:51.831 --> 04:48:55.559
You get pushed 20 feet away from me.

04:48:55.559 --> 04:48:56.559
MARISHA: Great.

04:48:56.559 --> 04:48:57.631
LAURA: Okay, that's good. That's good.

04:48:57.631 --> 04:48:58.464
ASHLEY: Awesome.

04:48:58.464 --> 04:48:59.681
MATT: Okay.

04:48:59.681 --> 04:49:01.441
Tyffial (pained grunt)

04:49:01.441 --> 04:49:02.831
"Shit!"

04:49:02.831 --> 04:49:04.281
And takes one more step forward,

04:49:04.281 --> 04:49:06.101
but that's the extent of her movement this turn.

04:49:06.101 --> 04:49:07.251
That finishes--

04:49:07.251 --> 04:49:08.451
Caleb, you're up.
TALIESIN: Not my turn.

04:49:08.451 --> 04:49:09.351
That was a reaction.

04:49:09.351 --> 04:49:10.184
MATT: Yup.

04:49:10.184 --> 04:49:11.017
ASHLEY: Awesome.
SAM: Nice.

04:49:12.061 --> 04:49:13.081
LIAM: That was a reaction?

04:49:13.081 --> 04:49:14.801
TALIESIN: That was a reaction.

04:49:14.801 --> 04:49:16.871
SAM: Yeah.
MATT: Caleb, it's your turn.

04:49:16.871 --> 04:49:18.695
LAURA: He's going after you.

04:49:18.695 --> 04:49:21.412
TALIESIN: My turn is immediately after you.

04:49:21.412 --> 04:49:22.419
LIAM: Immediately after me?

04:49:22.419 --> 04:49:23.561
LAURA: You're immediately after Lucien.

04:49:23.561 --> 04:49:24.810
TALIESIN: No.
LAURA: Yes.

04:49:24.810 --> 04:49:26.491
TALIESIN: Yeah, immediately after Lucien.

04:49:26.491 --> 04:49:27.771
LAURA: Lucien goes after you.
MATT: It's Lucien,

04:49:27.771 --> 04:49:31.021
then it's Cree, and then it's Caduceus.

04:49:32.521 --> 04:49:34.284
LIAM: I--

04:49:34.284 --> 04:49:36.439
SAM: -- would like to rage.
LIAM: -- will turn--

04:49:36.439 --> 04:49:39.966
(chuckling)

04:49:39.966 --> 04:49:41.857
LIAM: -- Beauregard

04:49:43.458 --> 04:49:46.301
into a giant mammoth.

04:49:46.301 --> 04:49:47.134
SAM: Mammoth?

04:49:47.134 --> 04:49:49.341
LIAM: Yeah, with 126 hit points

04:49:49.341 --> 04:49:50.511
and a speed of 40 feet,

04:49:50.511 --> 04:49:52.351
which is the same as an owl.

04:49:52.351 --> 04:49:53.184
SAM: Okay, okay.

04:49:53.184 --> 04:49:55.206
And a lot of people can jump on.

04:49:55.206 --> 04:49:57.031
MARISHA: Sure.

04:49:57.031 --> 04:49:57.864
LIAM: That's what I'm doing.

04:49:57.864 --> 04:49:59.221
SAM: Okay.
MATT: Okay.

04:49:59.221 --> 04:50:00.601
SAM: What about you?

04:50:00.601 --> 04:50:03.131
LIAM: I'm in Yasha's arms.

04:50:03.131 --> 04:50:05.251
MARISHA: We're all together, except for Fjord.

04:50:05.251 --> 04:50:06.641
SAM: Fjord's fine.

04:50:06.641 --> 04:50:08.271
MARISHA: If we can continue to kite them,

04:50:08.271 --> 04:50:09.631
even if they follow us,

04:50:09.631 --> 04:50:12.604
if we can move, and then fight as we move,

04:50:13.501 --> 04:50:16.101
we might eventually be able to get away.

04:50:16.101 --> 04:50:17.751
LIAM: You have 126 hit points.

04:50:17.751 --> 04:50:18.751
MARISHA: Thank you.

04:50:20.771 --> 04:50:22.161
MATT: Okay.

04:50:22.161 --> 04:50:23.701
LIAM: How many did you have?

04:50:23.701 --> 04:50:25.021
MARISHA: 27.

04:50:25.021 --> 04:50:26.858
LIAM: Cool.
SAM: That helps.

04:50:26.858 --> 04:50:28.367
LAURA: As long as--

04:50:28.367 --> 04:50:29.751
Whatever.

04:50:29.751 --> 04:50:32.541
MATT: So Caleb, you're being held by Yasha.

04:50:32.541 --> 04:50:33.374
Cast a spell.

04:50:33.374 --> 04:50:34.349
LAURA: Turn and run.

04:50:34.349 --> 04:50:35.766
MATT: That's your turn.

04:50:37.281 --> 04:50:39.292
SAM: Yeah, he's going to look at Caleb, right?

04:50:39.292 --> 04:50:40.292
Right?
MATT: All right.

04:50:41.151 --> 04:50:42.911
MARISHA: He failed his save on it.

04:50:42.911 --> 04:50:44.881
LIAM: Yeah, he failed to save, so he believes it.

04:50:44.881 --> 04:50:45.714
MATT: He does.

04:50:53.381 --> 04:50:55.955
I'm going to roll to see which one he's most worried about.

04:50:55.955 --> 04:50:57.528
I mean, you guys are all clustered there.

04:50:57.528 --> 04:51:00.195
LIAM: (exhales)

04:51:01.291 --> 04:51:02.424
LIAM: Caleb is doing this.

04:51:03.501 --> 04:51:05.531
SAM: Yeah, he's doing Naruto shit.

04:51:05.531 --> 04:51:06.762
He's doing Naruto moves.

04:51:06.762 --> 04:51:07.996
MATT: (laughs)

04:51:07.996 --> 04:51:09.265
LIAM: Kamehameha!

04:51:09.265 --> 04:51:11.248
(laughter)

04:51:11.248 --> 04:51:12.901
SAM: The fire's starting in his hands.

04:51:12.901 --> 04:51:14.367
It looks bad.
LAURA: Not fire.

04:51:14.367 --> 04:51:15.958
SAM: No, not fire. Plasma.

04:51:15.958 --> 04:51:16.799
Plasma!
ASHLEY: Yeah, lightning.

04:51:16.799 --> 04:51:17.782
SAM: I don't know what that is.

04:51:17.782 --> 04:51:19.708
He's doing it, though. It's crazy.

04:51:19.708 --> 04:51:21.671
MATT: One to 10--

04:51:21.671 --> 04:51:22.901
TALIESIN: Fuck, man.

04:51:22.901 --> 04:51:26.117
MATT: -- he focuses on him.

04:51:27.041 --> 04:51:29.287
11 to 20, he focuses that way.

04:51:29.287 --> 04:51:30.564
ASHLEY: Ugh.

04:51:31.445 --> 04:51:32.744
SAM: I can't see it. No one can.

04:51:32.744 --> 04:51:34.324
MARISHA: We can't see it. Turn the camera!

04:51:34.324 --> 04:51:37.582
Turn the PTZ!

04:51:37.582 --> 04:51:38.415
MATT: It's an eight.

04:51:38.415 --> 04:51:40.081
(shouting)

04:51:40.081 --> 04:51:41.080
(laughter)

04:51:41.080 --> 04:51:42.248
MATT: Can you see that on the camera?

04:51:42.248 --> 04:51:43.731
ASHLEY: Yeah.
LAURA: We saw it, we saw it.

04:51:43.731 --> 04:51:44.749
MARISHA: (sighs)

04:51:44.749 --> 04:51:45.808
MATT: Oh god.
SAM: Oh god!

04:51:45.808 --> 04:51:48.475
(shouting)

04:51:53.511 --> 04:51:54.881
MATT: You see him still standing there.

04:51:54.881 --> 04:51:57.761
Not changing the direction that he's facing,

04:51:57.761 --> 04:52:00.314
but suddenly this Caleb vanishes.

04:52:01.291 --> 04:52:03.933
SAM: Oh, okay, that didn't go like I wanted it to.

04:52:03.933 --> 04:52:05.221
MARISHA: Well, he's magic.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

04:52:05.221 --> 04:52:06.101
MARISHA: Magic Caleb.

04:52:06.101 --> 04:52:07.651
MATT: Well, we'll note that this isn't an actual illusion.

04:52:07.651 --> 04:52:09.296
This is something he sees in his head, technically, right?

04:52:09.296 --> 04:52:10.129
MARISHA and SAM: Yeah.

04:52:10.129 --> 04:52:11.906
MATT: So, no. Actually, he still continues to focus

04:52:11.906 --> 04:52:13.291
over in that way as the spell continues to go.

04:52:13.291 --> 04:52:14.297
It wasn't an illusion you've placed;

04:52:14.297 --> 04:52:16.608
it's in his mind, it maintains.

04:52:16.608 --> 04:52:18.758
At least until he gets to try for a second.

04:52:19.948 --> 04:52:21.621
LAURA: (fake sobs) Gonna cry.

04:52:21.621 --> 04:52:23.904
MATT: So, he's going to go ahead and move up.

04:52:24.896 --> 04:52:25.984
Lucien goes,

04:52:27.229 --> 04:52:29.014
(sighs) "Claim the rest.

04:52:30.081 --> 04:52:31.139
"The wizard's mine."

04:52:32.059 --> 04:52:33.311
He's going to step forward.

04:52:33.311 --> 04:52:34.551
ASHLEY: Yes, go get him.

04:52:34.551 --> 04:52:36.820
MATT: The blades out, and is going to go into a full

04:52:36.820 --> 04:52:37.653
(swishing)

04:52:37.653 --> 04:52:39.102
whirlwind.

04:52:39.102 --> 04:52:44.102
Dervish strike force against this casting Caleb.

04:52:48.061 --> 04:52:49.651
Everything seems to go through him.

04:52:49.651 --> 04:52:51.625
No reaction, no effect.

04:52:53.311 --> 04:52:55.121
The jig is up from this point.

04:52:55.121 --> 04:52:58.044
But he's unhappy about that.

04:52:59.136 --> 04:53:00.091
MARISHA: We put some distance.
MATT: Lucien--

04:53:00.091 --> 04:53:02.649
MARISHA: We put some distance.
MATT: -- turns around.

04:53:02.649 --> 04:53:04.465
LIAM: ? Turn around ?

04:53:04.465 --> 04:53:07.571
ASHLEY: ? Every now and then I get a little bit scared ?

04:53:09.213 --> 04:53:10.281
MATT: Okay.

04:53:10.281 --> 04:53:12.131
That's makes it Cree's turn.

04:53:12.131 --> 04:53:14.561
ASHLEY: (sighs)

04:53:14.561 --> 04:53:16.097
MATT: Cree--
LIAM: Fuck.

04:53:19.230 --> 04:53:20.531
Have to go to the bathroom again.

04:53:20.531 --> 04:53:23.561
ASHLEY and TALIESIN: I know, I got
to go to the bathroom so bad.

04:53:23.561 --> 04:53:25.849
TALIESIN: Weird question,
ASHLEY: Just pounding the tea.

04:53:25.849 --> 04:53:27.561
TALIESIN: Just quick, weird question.

04:53:27.561 --> 04:53:28.721
MATT: Yeah?

04:53:28.721 --> 04:53:31.364
TALIESIN: Are all of his people now in his cone?

04:53:32.985 --> 04:53:34.321
MATT: No.

04:53:34.321 --> 04:53:35.154
TALIESIN: Okay.

04:53:36.481 --> 04:53:37.314
Just curious.

04:53:39.621 --> 04:53:40.521
MATT: Oddly, no.

04:53:40.521 --> 04:53:41.471
TALIESIN: Okay.

04:53:41.471 --> 04:53:43.271
MARISHA: They're special.

04:53:43.271 --> 04:53:44.771
SAM: Oh, they're a hive mind or something?

04:53:44.771 --> 04:53:45.711
Maybe they don't--

04:53:45.711 --> 04:53:46.544
MARISHA: They're not.
MATT: Well, no.

04:53:46.544 --> 04:53:47.851
They've been affected by it.

04:53:47.851 --> 04:53:48.684
SAM: Oh.

04:53:48.684 --> 04:53:50.061
MATT: But just--

04:53:50.061 --> 04:53:51.791
SAM: Right now, it's not working.

04:53:51.791 --> 04:53:53.934
MATT: Well, you don't know, you don't see any variation.

04:53:53.934 --> 04:53:55.260
You just see him walk off into the snow

04:53:55.260 --> 04:53:56.234
and turn around angrily.

04:53:56.234 --> 04:53:57.292
TALIESIN: I thought that there was, like,

04:53:57.292 --> 04:53:59.061
that they were lit up or something.

04:53:59.061 --> 04:54:01.068
MATT: Correct. The energy on Tyffial's sword

04:54:01.068 --> 04:54:03.301
has not vanished.
TALIESIN: Okay.

04:54:03.301 --> 04:54:04.490
MATT: Okay.

04:54:04.490 --> 04:54:05.751
That brings us to Cree,

04:54:05.751 --> 04:54:10.331
who is going to cast Slow on all of you.

04:54:10.331 --> 04:54:11.641
MARISHA: Bitch.

04:54:11.641 --> 04:54:13.251
SAM: Counterspell that. Wait!
TALIESIN: Wait.

04:54:13.251 --> 04:54:14.084
SAM: Caleb's here.

04:54:14.084 --> 04:54:15.327
Caleb's counterspelling it.

04:54:15.327 --> 04:54:16.418
LAURA: Counterspell it!

04:54:16.418 --> 04:54:17.569
(laughter)

04:54:17.569 --> 04:54:18.744
TRAVIS: Where is Cree?

04:54:18.744 --> 04:54:20.494
SAM: (German accent) I would like to Counterspell.

04:54:20.494 --> 04:54:22.159
MATT: (laughs)

04:54:22.159 --> 04:54:23.604
SAM: At 4th-level.
TRAVIS: Where's Cree?

04:54:23.604 --> 04:54:25.071
MATT: Cree's over there.

04:54:25.071 --> 04:54:26.481
TRAVIS: Next to me?

04:54:26.481 --> 04:54:27.314
MATT: Yes.

04:54:27.314 --> 04:54:29.716
SAM: I see the Slow and I would like to Counterspell.

04:54:29.716 --> 04:54:31.271
TRAVIS: Does that count as an action or a reaction?

04:54:31.271 --> 04:54:32.221
MATT: Counterspell?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

04:54:32.221 --> 04:54:33.111
MATT: It's a reaction.

04:54:33.111 --> 04:54:35.231
MATT: I have a Counterspell.

04:54:35.231 --> 04:54:37.221
LAURA: Will you still be able to do other things?

04:54:37.221 --> 04:54:38.370
TRAVIS: Yeah.
LAURA: Okay.

04:54:38.370 --> 04:54:39.462
TRAVIS: I'll Counterspell.

04:54:39.462 --> 04:54:41.201
Cause Caleb's not here.
MATT: Counterspell?

04:54:41.201 --> 04:54:43.193
What's the range on Counterspell?

04:54:43.193 --> 04:54:44.671
TRAVIS: 60 feet.

04:54:44.671 --> 04:54:45.662
MATT: 60 feet.
MARISHA: Yes, yes.

04:54:45.662 --> 04:54:47.151
TALIESIN: Oh shit.
MATT: Okay.

04:54:48.001 --> 04:54:50.593
Otis is going to Counterspell your Counterspell.

04:54:50.593 --> 04:54:51.693
LAURA: No, Caleb would--

04:54:51.693 --> 04:54:54.459
SAM: (German accent) Caleb would Counterspell the Counterspell.

04:54:54.459 --> 04:54:57.534
LAURA: Caleb!
(laughter)

04:54:57.534 --> 04:54:59.151
LAURA: What are we going to do?

04:54:59.151 --> 04:55:00.291
MATT: Which he would do.

04:55:00.291 --> 04:55:01.679
LAURA: He would totally do it.

04:55:01.679 --> 04:55:02.512
MATT: I don't, I want it--

04:55:02.512 --> 04:55:03.345
SAM: We should wait till it he gets back.

04:55:03.345 --> 04:55:04.481
MATT: I should wait till he gets back.
SAM: No, that's the worst!

04:55:04.481 --> 04:55:05.941
MATT: I know.

04:55:05.941 --> 04:55:07.610
SAM: Let's all go to the bathroom and get him.

04:55:07.610 --> 04:55:08.443
Wait.

04:55:08.443 --> 04:55:10.970
We need you! Get back here!

04:55:10.970 --> 04:55:13.244
LAURA: We need you to Counterspell.
MARISHA: Counterspell!

04:55:13.244 --> 04:55:15.903
TRAVIS: We got Counterspell and counterspell Counterspell.

04:55:15.903 --> 04:55:16.911
LIAM: Tell me what happened, tell me what happened.

04:55:16.911 --> 04:55:19.161
MATT: So Cree cast Slow on that group

04:55:19.161 --> 04:55:20.491
of all of you right there.

04:55:20.491 --> 04:55:22.424
LIAM: Right.
MATT: Fjord Counterspelled it.

04:55:22.424 --> 04:55:25.521
Otis counterspelled his Counterspell.
LIAM: I've been thinking Counterspell for a fucking hour,

04:55:25.521 --> 04:55:26.549
Counterspell!

04:55:26.549 --> 04:55:27.797
(laughter)

04:55:27.797 --> 04:55:28.940
TRAVIS: Is this a triple Counterspell?

04:55:28.940 --> 04:55:30.039
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: It is.

04:55:30.039 --> 04:55:33.191
LIAM: At a-- d-d-d--

04:55:33.191 --> 04:55:34.324
LAURA: (plinking)

04:55:34.324 --> 04:55:35.707
LIAM: Oh my gosh.
ASHLEY: You can't triple stamp another--

04:55:35.707 --> 04:55:37.787
LIAM: At 4th-level, at 4th-level.

04:55:37.787 --> 04:55:38.887
MATT: Slow fails.

04:55:38.887 --> 04:55:39.841
MARISHA: Yeah!

04:55:39.841 --> 04:55:42.490
MATT: The Counterspell from Fjord goes through.

04:55:42.490 --> 04:55:45.291
Otis' Counterspell is negated by you.

04:55:45.291 --> 04:55:46.131
LIAM: Ooh.

04:55:46.131 --> 04:55:48.127
MATT: That's some blue magic shit right there.

04:55:48.127 --> 04:55:50.774
LIAM: That is all I've been fucking thinking for an hour.

04:55:50.774 --> 04:55:52.798
MARISHA: I reek, I smell so bad.

04:55:52.798 --> 04:55:55.433
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm sweating.
MATT: Caduceus.

04:55:55.433 --> 04:55:56.281
It's your turn.

04:55:56.281 --> 04:55:57.994
TALIESIN: I'm getting on top of the mammoth.

04:55:58.903 --> 04:56:00.820
MATT: You get on top of the mammoth.

04:56:02.231 --> 04:56:03.064
SAM: Feels like we've been--

04:56:03.064 --> 04:56:04.992
remember when I said I didn't want it to end?

04:56:04.992 --> 04:56:06.243
I want it to end now.

04:56:06.243 --> 04:56:07.821
I want it to be over.
(laughter)

04:56:07.821 --> 04:56:08.904
You can stop.

04:56:10.794 --> 04:56:11.627
SAM: Please.

04:56:11.627 --> 04:56:13.129
LAURA: I think this might be one of the longest games

04:56:13.129 --> 04:56:14.937
we've ever played.
SAM: I'm going to barf.

04:56:14.937 --> 04:56:16.837
LAURA: I'm feeling I'm going to barf.

04:56:17.683 --> 04:56:18.516
TALIESIN: Everybody's--

04:56:18.516 --> 04:56:20.851
LIAM: He's already dead.

04:56:20.851 --> 04:56:21.814
TALIESIN: Yeah, I got--

04:56:23.241 --> 04:56:24.791
since I don't really have much I can do

04:56:24.791 --> 04:56:26.221
beyond getting on a mammoth.

04:56:26.221 --> 04:56:27.609
I'm just going to--

04:56:31.581 --> 04:56:33.981
Who's within 30 feet of me?

04:56:33.981 --> 04:56:35.271
LAURA: Pretty much all of us, except for Fjord.

04:56:35.271 --> 04:56:36.104
MATT: All of you except for Fjord.

04:56:36.104 --> 04:56:38.011
Oh and Veth, Veth is too far.

04:56:38.011 --> 04:56:39.034
TALIESIN: Okay,

04:56:40.451 --> 04:56:42.361
Just for shits and giggles.

04:56:42.361 --> 04:56:43.919
I'm going to...

04:56:47.002 --> 04:56:49.851
cast Bless on anybody who's--

04:56:49.851 --> 04:56:51.731
I'm going to cast four blesses

04:56:51.731 --> 04:56:53.711
basically on anybody who's moving.

04:56:53.711 --> 04:56:56.421
So Bless on the mammoth,

04:56:56.421 --> 04:56:57.431
Bless on Yasha.

04:56:57.431 --> 04:56:58.713
Who else is a--?

04:56:58.713 --> 04:57:00.401
LAURA: I'm a mover.

04:57:00.401 --> 04:57:01.604
TALIESIN: Bless on Jester.

04:57:03.591 --> 04:57:04.667
ASHLEY: That's a d4, right?

04:57:04.667 --> 04:57:06.851
TALIESIN: Yes, it's a d4 to saves and--

04:57:06.851 --> 04:57:08.091
MARISHA: Oh wait, did you just bless me?

04:57:08.091 --> 04:57:09.161
TALIESIN: And you.

04:57:09.161 --> 04:57:10.525
SAM: As the mammoth.
MARISHA: Oh, and me.

04:57:10.525 --> 04:57:12.316
As the movers?
TALIESIN: The movers.

04:57:12.316 --> 04:57:13.621
MATT: And who's the fourth one?

04:57:13.621 --> 04:57:15.379
TALIESIN: Beau. And it's--

04:57:15.379 --> 04:57:16.391
MATT: And yourself?

04:57:16.391 --> 04:57:17.881
TALIESIN: No.
SAM: Beau is the mammoth.

04:57:17.881 --> 04:57:20.591
MATT: We have Yasha, Jester, Beau, and who else?

04:57:20.591 --> 04:57:22.704
TALIESIN: Oh, Yasha, Jester, Beau and--

04:57:23.551 --> 04:57:25.401
SAM: It's either Caleb or me.

04:57:25.401 --> 04:57:26.489
Caleb's closer
MATT and TALIESIN: Not you.

04:57:26.489 --> 04:57:28.047
TALIESIN: You're not there, Caleb.
LAURA: You're too far.

04:57:28.047 --> 04:57:29.333
MATT: Caleb. All right, you got it.

04:57:29.333 --> 04:57:34.333
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's 1d4 for saving throws and--

04:57:34.333 --> 04:57:35.676
MARISHA: Blessed.
TALIESIN and MATT: Attack rolls.

04:57:35.676 --> 04:57:36.509
MATT: Yep.
LIAM: I feel blessed.

04:57:36.509 --> 04:57:37.904
MATT: All right that finishes your go, Caduceus.

04:57:37.904 --> 04:57:38.851
You're climbing onto the mammoth,

04:57:38.851 --> 04:57:39.734
holding onto the side of the fur.

04:57:39.734 --> 04:57:41.161
Just holding on for dear life.

04:57:41.161 --> 04:57:42.781
TALIESIN: I'm holding on.

04:57:42.781 --> 04:57:43.614
MATT: All right.

04:57:43.614 --> 04:57:45.081
It's Otis' turn.

04:57:45.081 --> 04:57:45.914
MARISHA: Got this.
MATT: Otis--

04:57:45.914 --> 04:57:46.997
SAM: Fuck you, Otis.
MATT: -- is going to go ahead

04:57:46.997 --> 04:57:51.004
and throw three Eldritch Blasts at you.

04:57:53.551 --> 04:57:54.851
LAURA: To try to pull you back.

04:57:56.041 --> 04:57:58.424
MATT: That is going to be a

04:57:58.424 --> 04:58:01.353
25 to hit.

04:58:01.353 --> 04:58:05.166
TALIESIN: It does.

04:58:05.166 --> 04:58:07.208
MATT: You take three points of force damage.

04:58:07.208 --> 04:58:08.041
TALIESIN: Oh shit.

04:58:08.041 --> 04:58:09.721
MATT: And get yanked off the mammoth.

04:58:09.721 --> 04:58:11.671
SAM: Ugh, this fucking guy.

04:58:11.671 --> 04:58:14.321
MATT: Next attack is 12.

04:58:14.321 --> 04:58:15.191
TALIESIN: Nope.

04:58:15.191 --> 04:58:17.831
MATT: And 13, he rolled a two and a three.

04:58:17.831 --> 04:58:18.664
TALIESIN: Nope.

04:58:18.664 --> 04:58:21.270
MATT: So yeah, that's it.

04:58:21.270 --> 04:58:22.621
And as a bonus action he's going to go ahead

04:58:22.621 --> 04:58:24.221
and shoot you with his crossbow.

04:58:25.061 --> 04:58:27.771
TALIESIN: That close?

04:58:27.771 --> 04:58:29.061
MATT: You're still 10 feet from him.

04:58:29.061 --> 04:58:30.480
You're not quite up against him.

04:58:30.480 --> 04:58:34.151
And that is going to miss, 14 to hit.

04:58:34.151 --> 04:58:36.881
TALIESIN: Is there anything I can do?

04:58:36.881 --> 04:58:38.960
TRAVIS: Is he that little mini that's right behind Caduceus?

04:58:38.960 --> 04:58:40.134
MATT: Yep.
TRAVIS: Wow.

04:58:40.134 --> 04:58:41.226
MATT: Little halfling.

04:58:41.226 --> 04:58:42.292
Jester, your go.

04:58:42.292 --> 04:58:43.694
TRAVIS: I lost him in the--

04:58:43.694 --> 04:58:48.504
LAURA: I'm going to fly forward, grab Caduceus.

04:58:52.101 --> 04:58:53.001
MATT: Grab Caduceus.

04:58:53.001 --> 04:58:54.701
LAURA: And fly towards Veth.

04:58:56.284 --> 04:58:57.501
MATT: This way.

04:58:57.501 --> 04:58:58.619
You got it.

04:58:58.619 --> 04:58:59.452
Okay.

04:58:59.452 --> 04:59:02.001
LAURA: Can I use-- was that my action, grabbing Caduceus?

04:59:02.001 --> 04:59:03.009
MATT: Correct.
LAURA: Okay.

04:59:03.009 --> 04:59:05.751
MATT: That gets you about there.

04:59:05.751 --> 04:59:07.417
ASHLEY: Where's Beau? Oh, she's the mammoth.

04:59:07.417 --> 04:59:09.383
LIAM: She's a may-moth.
ASHLEY: Panicked for a minute.

04:59:09.383 --> 04:59:10.216
MARISHA: (laughs)

04:59:10.216 --> 04:59:11.049
TALIESIN: Thank you.

04:59:11.049 --> 04:59:12.614
LIAM: The mammoth is blue.

04:59:15.221 --> 04:59:16.124
Obviously blue.

04:59:17.241 --> 04:59:18.074
MATT: So.
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

04:59:18.074 --> 04:59:19.591
Blue, blue mammoth.

04:59:19.591 --> 04:59:20.481
MATT: That brings us to--

04:59:20.481 --> 04:59:21.314
that's Jester's turn.

04:59:21.314 --> 04:59:22.257
Fjord, you're up.

04:59:22.257 --> 04:59:24.415
LIAM: Mammoth.

04:59:24.415 --> 04:59:27.281
TRAVIS: Can I see Lucien from where I am?

04:59:27.281 --> 04:59:29.184
I can, with darkvision 60 feet?
MATT: You can.

04:59:29.184 --> 04:59:31.567
Yeah.
TRAVIS: Just for my own edification,

04:59:31.567 --> 04:59:35.164
does he have any kind of a bag of holding around his person?

04:59:35.164 --> 04:59:35.997
Around his waist?

04:59:35.997 --> 04:59:36.913
I don't want to spend an action

04:59:36.913 --> 04:59:38.382
if that's what it'll take. I'll forego that.

04:59:38.382 --> 04:59:42.172
I'm just curious before I run for my fucking life.

04:59:42.172 --> 04:59:43.791
MATT: If you want to spend an--

04:59:43.791 --> 04:59:46.191
TRAVIS: Nah, I don't want to spend anything.

04:59:46.191 --> 04:59:47.252
LAURA: Bonus action?

04:59:47.252 --> 04:59:49.560
MATT: I will say at your passive perception,

04:59:49.560 --> 04:59:51.111
it's hard to tell,

04:59:51.111 --> 04:59:52.941
It's low light.
TRAVIS: Okay, that's fair.

04:59:52.941 --> 04:59:54.031
With my--
MATT: And you have a fire,

04:59:54.031 --> 04:59:55.421
a flaming war hammer in front of you.

04:59:55.421 --> 04:59:56.631
And so when you have that bright light

04:59:56.631 --> 04:59:59.511
versus a dark background,

04:59:59.511 --> 05:00:00.521
your eyes are adjusted

05:00:00.521 --> 05:00:01.891
and you don't make out much detail at this distance.

05:00:01.891 --> 05:00:02.724
TRAVIS: That's totally fair.

05:00:02.724 --> 05:00:07.211
I will use my bonus action to Far Step 60 feet

05:00:07.211 --> 05:00:10.141
towards the rest of the party.

05:00:10.141 --> 05:00:10.974
MATT: Okay.

05:00:10.974 --> 05:00:13.361
LAURA: Can you Far Step onto Beau?

05:00:13.361 --> 05:00:14.194
MARISHA: Yeah.

05:00:15.051 --> 05:00:16.121
LIAM: Onto a mammoth?

05:00:16.121 --> 05:00:17.121
TRAVIS: Is Beau the mammoth?

05:00:17.121 --> 05:00:18.930
LIAM and MARISHA: Yes.
TRAVIS: Yes, I can.

05:00:18.930 --> 05:00:20.579
MATT: (whooshes) Onto the mammoth.
ASHLEY: Awesome.

05:00:20.579 --> 05:00:21.477
MARISHA: Great.

05:00:21.477 --> 05:00:22.477
TRAVIS: Is there a reason I'm doing that

05:00:22.477 --> 05:00:24.704
and not running an additional 30 feet away?

05:00:26.251 --> 05:00:28.481
LAURA: No.
SAM: For love.

05:00:28.481 --> 05:00:29.341
MARISHA: I can sweep you up--
MATT: Well, you're there.

05:00:29.341 --> 05:00:30.174
MARISHA: -- on the way.

05:00:30.174 --> 05:00:31.541
TRAVIS: I'll just keep running 30 feet

05:00:31.541 --> 05:00:33.531
in the direction that everybody else is going.

05:00:33.531 --> 05:00:34.401
MATT: Okay.

05:00:34.401 --> 05:00:36.551
MARISHA: Yeah, get the fuck out of Dodge.

05:00:36.551 --> 05:00:37.384
MATT: You've got it.

05:00:37.384 --> 05:00:40.641
All right, that finishes your turn, Fjord.

05:00:40.641 --> 05:00:41.814
It's now Zoran's turn.

05:00:43.191 --> 05:00:48.031
He is going to go ahead and move up to the mammoth

05:00:48.031 --> 05:00:51.541
and take two swings with the giant flaming mall.

05:00:51.541 --> 05:00:52.981
MARISHA: Where's my mammoth's AC?

05:00:52.981 --> 05:00:53.991
LIAM: 126.

05:00:53.991 --> 05:00:54.832
MARISHA: AC?

05:00:54.832 --> 05:00:56.871
LIAM: Oh, AC?
MATT: I was like, Jesus Christ!

05:00:56.871 --> 05:00:57.961
LIAM: It's 126.

05:00:57.961 --> 05:00:59.071
(laughter)

05:00:59.071 --> 05:01:02.911
LIAM: It is 13.

05:01:02.911 --> 05:01:04.886
SAM: Ooh.
MATT: Hits.

05:01:04.886 --> 05:01:05.719
Hits.

05:01:05.719 --> 05:01:07.331
LIAM: Dat ass.
MARISHA: Great.

05:01:07.331 --> 05:01:08.747
MATT: So you take

05:01:10.664 --> 05:01:12.914
12 points of bludgeoning damage and five fire.

05:01:14.668 --> 05:01:17.414
And 10 points of bludgeoning damage, two fire.

05:01:18.281 --> 05:01:19.711
MARISHA: Okay, great.

05:01:19.711 --> 05:01:21.031
MATT: That finishes Zoran's turn.

05:01:21.031 --> 05:01:22.448
Yasha, you're up.

05:01:24.921 --> 05:01:25.754
ASHLEY: Okay.

05:01:25.754 --> 05:01:26.634
TALIESIN: What did I miss?

05:01:27.590 --> 05:01:31.001
ASHLEY: I'm going to keep flying us,

05:01:31.001 --> 05:01:31.834
MARISHA: Not much.

05:01:31.834 --> 05:01:34.791
ASHLEY: I can fly 30 feet, so that a-way.

05:01:34.791 --> 05:01:36.051
TALIESIN: Oh, good.
MATT: Here you go.

05:01:36.051 --> 05:01:38.211
That'll get you about there.

05:01:38.211 --> 05:01:39.371
That finishes Yasha's turn.

05:01:39.371 --> 05:01:40.231
Beau.

05:01:40.231 --> 05:01:41.064
ASHLEY: Oh!

05:01:43.351 --> 05:01:44.851
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

05:01:44.851 --> 05:01:46.021
Oh, I can't do it. I already did it today.

05:01:46.021 --> 05:01:47.391
Nevermind, good. Good to go.

05:01:47.391 --> 05:01:49.601
MARISHA: So Jester-- everyone's accounted for.

05:01:49.601 --> 05:01:53.461
Is everyone on a ride except for Fjord and Veth?

05:01:53.461 --> 05:01:54.311
SAM and LAURA: Mm-hmm.

05:01:54.311 --> 05:01:55.341
LIAM: Fjord's on you.

05:01:55.341 --> 05:01:56.855
LAURA: No.
MARISHA: Fjord forward ran past.

05:01:56.855 --> 05:01:57.780
LIAM: Ran past?
LAURA: Yeah.

05:01:57.780 --> 05:02:02.692
MARISHA: So I want to run forward.

05:02:02.692 --> 05:02:04.111
MATT: What's your movement as a mammoth?

05:02:04.111 --> 05:02:06.181
MARISHA: Apparently 40.
LIAM: 40 for movement, yeah.

05:02:06.181 --> 05:02:07.341
MATT: This way, this way?

05:02:07.341 --> 05:02:12.331
MARISHA: I want to run and can I, not harm,

05:02:12.331 --> 05:02:16.054
but scoop up was my tusks Fjord and Veth on the way?

05:02:17.051 --> 05:02:18.431
MATT: Fjord you can. You can't get to Veth.

05:02:18.431 --> 05:02:19.264
But I'll say--

05:02:19.264 --> 05:02:20.567
I'll let you do that.
TALIESIN: Veth is fast.

05:02:20.567 --> 05:02:21.808
SAM: I'm faster than you.
LAURA: Yeah.

05:02:21.808 --> 05:02:22.641
MATT: Yeah
MARISHA: Don't move them back.

05:02:22.641 --> 05:02:23.474
I want to move forward.

05:02:23.474 --> 05:02:24.958
MATT: No, I'm putting them on there

05:02:24.958 --> 05:02:26.488
and then moving you forward.

05:02:26.488 --> 05:02:28.451
TRAVIS: God, don't put us closer to the--

05:02:28.451 --> 05:02:29.961
TALIESIN:: Yeah, is that an action or is that a--

05:02:29.961 --> 05:02:30.861
MATT: That's your action to scoop them up.

05:02:30.861 --> 05:02:32.521
TALIESIN: Okay.

05:02:32.521 --> 05:02:33.617
MARISHA: As-- okay.

05:02:35.231 --> 05:02:36.631
As it--
MATT: It takes

05:02:36.631 --> 05:02:38.656
the coordination to get down and try and scoop them up,

05:02:38.656 --> 05:02:40.241
cause you're basically giving him

05:02:40.241 --> 05:02:41.431
forced movement onto your back.

05:02:41.431 --> 05:02:42.540
So you're placing him.

05:02:42.540 --> 05:02:44.161
MARISHA: I'll still get them further than what we will

05:02:44.161 --> 05:02:45.661
and then I'll move another 40.

05:02:47.661 --> 05:02:48.494
MATT: Well, it's your action to do that.

05:02:48.494 --> 05:02:49.327
So you moved.

05:02:49.327 --> 05:02:51.171
So that's as far as you can get right there.

05:02:52.421 --> 05:02:54.430
We'll say with the 40 feet--
LIAM: Scoop up is the action.

05:02:54.430 --> 05:02:56.391
MATT: Scooping him up is the action and you moved 40 feet.

05:02:56.391 --> 05:02:57.332
MARISHA: Yeah!
MATT: Yeah.

05:02:57.332 --> 05:02:58.931
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: Yeah, so you're good.

05:02:58.931 --> 05:03:00.173
Okay.
MARISHA: I still got him

05:03:00.173 --> 05:03:01.991
further away than what he was, correct?

05:03:01.991 --> 05:03:02.824
MATT: Yes.

05:03:02.824 --> 05:03:03.657
MARISHA: Okay.
MATT: Veth.

05:03:05.001 --> 05:03:10.001
SAM: Um, I'm going to shoot, but-- and then run.

05:03:11.296 --> 05:03:12.854
But who should I aim for?

05:03:15.621 --> 05:03:17.304
That Otis is a problem.

05:03:18.291 --> 05:03:19.991
LAURA: Yeah, because they've got distance.

05:03:21.526 --> 05:03:24.356
SAM: Um, the big guy can run, too, right?

05:03:25.281 --> 05:03:27.801
LAURA: It seemed like his movement was more than 30 feet.

05:03:27.801 --> 05:03:29.301
Cause Fjord went an extra 30 feet

05:03:29.301 --> 05:03:31.741
and then Zoran moved towards Beau

05:03:31.741 --> 05:03:33.561
and went farther than Fjord did.

05:03:33.561 --> 05:03:35.744
So maybe his movement is like 40 or...

05:03:39.241 --> 05:03:41.028
SAM: But I hate Otis.

05:03:41.028 --> 05:03:42.991
MARISHA: (laughs)

05:03:42.991 --> 05:03:44.425
MATT: Veth, what you doing?

05:03:44.425 --> 05:03:47.901
SAM: I'm loading my (whooshing) bola bolt.

05:03:47.901 --> 05:03:49.264
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: Yes.

05:03:50.101 --> 05:03:52.921
SAM: And I just got to figure out who I'm shooting it at.

05:03:52.921 --> 05:03:53.801
I hate Otis.

05:03:53.801 --> 05:03:54.811
I'm going to shoot it at Otis.

05:03:54.811 --> 05:03:55.644
TRAVIS: Caleb?
MATT: Okay, go for it.

05:03:55.644 --> 05:03:56.664
Roll for an attack.

05:03:58.111 --> 05:03:59.691
SAM: Um, where's my dice?

05:03:59.691 --> 05:04:02.451
My dice are gone. There they are.

05:04:02.451 --> 05:04:04.101
Uh.

05:04:04.101 --> 05:04:05.121
LIAM: Yeah.

05:04:05.121 --> 05:04:06.537
SAM: 25.

05:04:06.537 --> 05:04:08.041
MATT: 25 hits.

05:04:08.041 --> 05:04:09.591
SAM: So like no damage.

05:04:09.591 --> 05:04:11.149
LIAM: [inaudible]

05:04:11.149 --> 05:04:12.581
SAM: I'm just going to try wrap it around--

05:04:12.581 --> 05:04:14.664
MATT: You got it.
SAM: -- his fucking feet.

05:04:16.321 --> 05:04:17.154
LIAM: I've got it.

05:04:17.154 --> 05:04:20.631
MATT: Yeah, he (whooshing) gets knocked to the ground prone.

05:04:20.631 --> 05:04:21.908
MARISHA: Nice.
LAURA: Nice, nice.

05:04:21.908 --> 05:04:24.691
SAM: Okay, and then I'm going to run and dash.

05:04:24.691 --> 05:04:26.374
MATT: All right. (whooshing) You are off the board.

05:04:26.374 --> 05:04:27.851
You are--

05:04:27.851 --> 05:04:29.307
SAM: Bye, guys
MATT: -- 60 feet that way.

05:04:29.307 --> 05:04:30.411
MARISHA: Yeah, go.

05:04:30.411 --> 05:04:32.077
SAM: Catch up!
MARISHA: We're right behind you.

05:04:32.077 --> 05:04:32.910
MATT: All right.

05:04:34.631 --> 05:04:36.951
That brings us to Tyffial,

05:04:36.951 --> 05:04:40.401
who's going to go ahead and move

05:04:40.401 --> 05:04:43.904
and then run to just get up behind the mammoth

05:04:43.904 --> 05:04:46.881
and that's as much as she can do.

05:04:46.881 --> 05:04:49.821
But she is now engaged with the back of you.

05:04:49.821 --> 05:04:52.831
That brings us to Caleb.

05:04:52.831 --> 05:04:54.901
LIAM: Uh, it's on me?

05:04:54.901 --> 05:04:56.501
Can I see where Veth is?

05:04:56.501 --> 05:04:58.741
Probably not, like, we're running away from that fire.

05:04:58.741 --> 05:05:00.851
MATT: Yeah, you do not have darkvision.

05:05:00.851 --> 05:05:02.871
I'd say you're pretty hard pressed to see where Veth is.

05:05:02.871 --> 05:05:04.655
Maybe like cursory, like, you know

05:05:04.655 --> 05:05:05.982
you're not too far high up.

05:05:05.982 --> 05:05:08.001
I'd say you can look down and you can see her moving--

05:05:08.001 --> 05:05:09.471
SAM: You might hear (whimpering).
MATT: -- faintly.

05:05:09.471 --> 05:05:11.079
Yeah. I'd say it's more audio.

05:05:11.079 --> 05:05:14.141
LIAM: And I have a concentration spell on Beau.

05:05:14.141 --> 05:05:14.974
MATT: Mm-hmm.

05:05:14.974 --> 05:05:17.121
LIAM: But I can still see our enemies right now, right?

05:05:17.121 --> 05:05:17.954
MATT: Correct.

05:05:20.611 --> 05:05:23.121
LIAM: Hey, let's throw a Fireball at them.

05:05:23.121 --> 05:05:24.261
MATT: Sure.

05:05:24.261 --> 05:05:25.629
LIAM: I'm being carried.

05:05:27.876 --> 05:05:31.596
I will cast Fireball at a fifth level.

05:05:35.461 --> 05:05:36.294
Shit.

05:05:36.294 --> 05:05:37.351
SAM: Maybe we can beat them, guys.

05:05:37.351 --> 05:05:38.539
Should we stay and fight?

05:05:38.539 --> 05:05:40.531
(laughter)

05:05:40.531 --> 05:05:42.451
MATT: Sorry, I was--

05:05:42.451 --> 05:05:44.411
Where are you throwing it?

05:05:44.411 --> 05:05:45.271
LIAM: Um.

05:05:45.271 --> 05:05:46.104
ASHLEY: --bad idea.

05:05:46.104 --> 05:05:48.341
MARISHA: (laughs)

05:05:48.341 --> 05:05:52.651
LIAM: Is-- (stammering) what is Lucien doing?

05:05:52.651 --> 05:05:54.401
Lucien is staring <i>at</i> us?

05:05:54.401 --> 05:05:55.241
MATT: He's turned around and

05:05:55.241 --> 05:05:57.824
he's staring in your direction.

05:06:01.991 --> 05:06:03.474
LIAM: Taking my 60 seconds.

05:06:04.731 --> 05:06:05.564
Uh.

05:06:07.731 --> 05:06:08.814
I will.

05:06:12.138 --> 05:06:13.436
MATT: You shooting a fireball or--?

05:06:13.436 --> 05:06:18.436
LIAM: No, I will cast Disintegrate

05:06:18.678 --> 05:06:21.594
at Otis, who's on the ground.

05:06:21.594 --> 05:06:23.364
MATT: Okay, all righty.

05:06:25.071 --> 05:06:28.743
LIAM: So that is a dex save of 18.

05:06:28.743 --> 05:06:30.708
MARISHA: Mm. Mm.

05:06:30.708 --> 05:06:31.541
Mm-hmm.

05:06:32.831 --> 05:06:34.830
MATT: Natural 20.

05:06:34.830 --> 05:06:36.511
I'm not even joking.
TRAVIS: You've got to be--

05:06:36.511 --> 05:06:38.259
MATT: I get some this game, too, guys!

05:06:38.259 --> 05:06:40.111
TRAVIS: No, I know.
MATT: You can't get all the twenties.

05:06:40.111 --> 05:06:42.351
LAURA: Does he get disadvantage
because he's prone on the dex save?

05:06:42.351 --> 05:06:43.184
LIAM: Prone on the ground?

05:06:43.184 --> 05:06:46.077
MARISHA: Yeah, with his ankles tied up?

05:06:49.711 --> 05:06:51.481
MATT: Prone only affects attack rolls.

05:06:51.481 --> 05:06:53.201
It doesn't affect-- or--

05:06:53.201 --> 05:06:54.311
LIAM: Doesn't affect dex saves?

05:06:54.311 --> 05:06:55.251
MATT: Nope.

05:06:55.251 --> 05:06:56.891
LAURA: Well.
LIAM: Okay.

05:06:56.891 --> 05:06:58.251
Roll out of the way.

05:06:58.251 --> 05:06:59.451
There it is.

05:06:59.451 --> 05:07:02.461
I will continue to be carried by Angel Blood.

05:07:02.461 --> 05:07:03.580
MATT: Okay.

05:07:03.580 --> 05:07:04.461
LIAM: (exhales)

05:07:04.461 --> 05:07:05.984
MATT: Top the round is Lucien.

05:07:05.984 --> 05:07:07.482
LIAM: (exhales)

05:07:07.482 --> 05:07:11.408
MATT: Lucien's going to go ahead and move right there.

05:07:11.408 --> 05:07:13.491
LAURA: He's going to be able to--

05:07:14.535 --> 05:07:17.081
ASHLEY: (sighs)

05:07:17.081 --> 05:07:19.361
LAURA: I can't see distance because of the--

05:07:20.826 --> 05:07:23.294
MARISHA: Yeah, the distance is tough without a grid.

05:07:23.294 --> 05:07:24.421
MATT: I know, it--

05:07:24.421 --> 05:07:25.933
TRAVIS: Yeah, whatever--
LIAM: That's right on the edge.

05:07:25.933 --> 05:07:27.166
LAURA: It's fine, it's fine.

05:07:28.747 --> 05:07:29.647
TALIESIN: I personally feel like

05:07:29.647 --> 05:07:32.733
we should be considering-- have, like-- yeah.

05:07:32.733 --> 05:07:34.101
MARISHA: What?

05:07:34.101 --> 05:07:36.146
TALIESIN: That's a lot of movement right there.

05:07:38.967 --> 05:07:39.958
LIAM: (nervous grunt)

05:07:39.958 --> 05:07:40.941
MATT: About 30 feet.

05:07:40.941 --> 05:07:42.263
TRAVIS: And who's-- who's--
MATT: 35.

05:07:42.263 --> 05:07:44.307
TRAVIS: Who in their party is right up on us, that's--?

05:07:44.307 --> 05:07:46.921
MATT: That's Tyffial.
TRAVIS: Tyffial. And that's it?

05:07:46.921 --> 05:07:48.669
Is Otis real close, too?

05:07:48.669 --> 05:07:50.531
TALIESIN: Otis is down.

05:07:50.531 --> 05:07:52.040
ASHLEY: Okay.
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah.

05:07:52.040 --> 05:07:54.269
MATT: You are some lucky fuckers.

05:07:54.269 --> 05:07:55.111
ASHLEY: Oh!

05:07:55.111 --> 05:07:57.511
MATT: If I push it right to the edge--

05:07:57.511 --> 05:08:00.920
LIAM: Still doesn't get--
MATT: Oh, goddamn it, okay.

05:08:00.920 --> 05:08:02.678
LAURA: (laugh-sobbing)

05:08:03.578 --> 05:08:04.644
LIAM: Ugh.

05:08:06.658 --> 05:08:08.691
MATT: Okay, well then.

05:08:08.691 --> 05:08:10.241
That's going to be Lucien's turn.

05:08:13.516 --> 05:08:15.024
That brings us to--

05:08:17.990 --> 05:08:20.264
Cree's going to move over this way.

05:08:20.264 --> 05:08:21.614
LIAM: Agh, fuck.

05:08:21.614 --> 05:08:22.839
MATT: Cree's going to attempt to...

05:08:24.905 --> 05:08:26.446
cast Slow again.

05:08:26.446 --> 05:08:28.264
MARISHA: Oh.
ASHLEY: Bitch.

05:08:29.318 --> 05:08:30.151
(sighs)

05:08:30.151 --> 05:08:31.875
SAM: She's just doing her job, guys.

05:08:31.875 --> 05:08:33.425
ASHLEY: That's true, that's true, that's true.

05:08:33.425 --> 05:08:34.341
MATT: Okay.

05:08:35.992 --> 05:08:37.401
Keep it in range--

05:08:37.401 --> 05:08:40.226
If I could have--
LIAM: I just went.

05:08:40.226 --> 05:08:41.120
MATT: I need--
TALIESIN: Reaction.

05:08:41.120 --> 05:08:44.381
LIAM: Cue it up again.
MATT: I need the mammoth,

05:08:44.381 --> 05:08:46.204
I need the owl--

05:08:46.204 --> 05:08:47.416
LIAM: Uh, Counterspell.

05:08:47.416 --> 05:08:50.124
I just went, so I got a new reaction queued up.

05:08:50.124 --> 05:08:51.779
MATT: What's the range on Counterspell?

05:08:51.779 --> 05:08:52.644
LIAM: 60.

05:08:53.701 --> 05:08:57.130
SAM: (whispering) Oh, no. She knows where you are.

05:08:57.130 --> 05:08:59.786
MATT: You are too far to Counterspell.
LIAM: Oh, I am over there.

05:08:59.786 --> 05:09:01.803
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

05:09:01.803 --> 05:09:04.016
MATT: So if I can get a--

05:09:04.016 --> 05:09:05.778
MARISHA: What do I roll for the mammoth?

05:09:05.778 --> 05:09:07.678
MATT: Wisdom saving throw for the mammoth.

05:09:07.678 --> 05:09:08.651
Wisdom saving throw for the--

05:09:08.651 --> 05:09:09.803
LIAM: 126.

05:09:11.508 --> 05:09:13.316
TALIESIN: With a d4.
LIAM: Straight roll.

05:09:13.316 --> 05:09:14.918
LAURA: With a d4.

05:09:14.918 --> 05:09:15.751
MARISHA: Cause I am blessed,

05:09:15.751 --> 05:09:17.384
#blessed.
TRAVIS: Am I close enough?

05:09:17.384 --> 05:09:19.201
I have one more.

05:09:19.201 --> 05:09:20.501
TALIESIN: Oh!

05:09:20.501 --> 05:09:21.334
Can you--

05:09:21.334 --> 05:09:23.026
MATT: If you want to try it.

05:09:23.026 --> 05:09:24.729
TALIESIN: Take a look, where are you?

05:09:24.729 --> 05:09:25.902
TRAVIS: No, I'm going to hold it.

05:09:25.902 --> 05:09:27.377
MATT: You're on the mammoth.

05:09:27.377 --> 05:09:29.441
SAM: You're going to hold?
TALIESIN: Oh my god, you could--

05:09:29.441 --> 05:09:31.233
SAM: You're going to hold it, for what?

05:09:31.233 --> 05:09:33.261
He's got more.
TALIESIN: This is--

05:09:33.261 --> 05:09:34.489
TRAVIS: I'm going to hold it.

05:09:34.489 --> 05:09:35.447
MATT: Okay.

05:09:36.871 --> 05:09:38.401
MARISHA: What are you holding?
MATT: So.

05:09:38.401 --> 05:09:39.951
LAURA: 22 wisdom saving throw.

05:09:39.951 --> 05:09:41.267
MATT: 22 wisdom saving throw?

05:09:41.267 --> 05:09:43.889
You save.
LAURA: I've got a plus ten on my wisdom, so.

05:09:43.889 --> 05:09:47.302
MATT: No, as the owl.

05:09:47.302 --> 05:09:49.602
LAURA: (quietly) Oh, fuck me running.

05:09:51.009 --> 05:09:52.375
LIAM: Same roll.

05:09:53.611 --> 05:09:55.311
LIAM: So, 12.

05:09:55.311 --> 05:09:56.144
LAURA: Yeah.

05:09:56.144 --> 05:09:57.451
TALIESIN: With the d4?
LIAM: --plus ten.

05:09:57.451 --> 05:09:58.284
LAURA: Yeah.

05:09:58.284 --> 05:10:00.100
TALIESIN: Fuck.
MATT: That makes you slowed.

05:10:01.638 --> 05:10:02.471
TALIESIN: Shit.

05:10:03.311 --> 05:10:07.052
LAURA: Yeah, that's-- nine plus three is--

05:10:07.052 --> 05:10:08.494
12-- 13.

05:10:08.494 --> 05:10:10.321
Yeah, that's doesn't--
MARISHA: 14.

05:10:10.321 --> 05:10:11.637
MATT: Slowed.

05:10:14.601 --> 05:10:16.651
You guys are now moving at half speed.

05:10:18.601 --> 05:10:20.511
LIAM: Who all, the entire party?
MATT: That finishes Cree's turn.

05:10:20.511 --> 05:10:22.471
LAURA: No, just me and Beau.

05:10:22.471 --> 05:10:24.291
MATT: The two of you, and then I actually will ask

05:10:24.291 --> 05:10:25.401
for both Caduceus and Fjord

05:10:25.401 --> 05:10:27.851
since they were also in the same cube area.

05:10:27.851 --> 05:10:29.676
Wisdom save, wisdom save.

05:10:31.575 --> 05:10:32.725
LIAM: (quietly) Fuck.

05:10:34.381 --> 05:10:35.348
TRAVIS: 19.

05:10:35.348 --> 05:10:36.531
MATT: 19 is a success.

05:10:36.531 --> 05:10:38.197
TALIESIN: 26.
MATT: Success.

05:10:38.197 --> 05:10:40.841
So just-- just your rides.

05:10:40.841 --> 05:10:43.533
TALIESIN: Do I have anything to fucking--
TRAVIS: Did you say 46?

05:10:43.533 --> 05:10:45.471
MATT: No, 26.
TRAVIS: Oh.

05:10:45.471 --> 05:10:46.587
MATT: Caduceus.

05:10:48.418 --> 05:10:49.781
TALIESIN: So, yeah, there's--

05:10:49.781 --> 05:10:52.918
Lesser Restoration doesn't do shit for that, does it?

05:10:52.918 --> 05:10:54.318
SAM: No.
TALIESIN: Fuck.

05:10:55.863 --> 05:10:57.831
SAM: It's okay, we'll still-- we'll still make it.

05:10:57.831 --> 05:11:00.814
ASHLEY: This is a bit of a pickle.

05:11:00.814 --> 05:11:04.039
(laughter)

05:11:05.572 --> 05:11:06.630
LIAM: (sighs)

05:11:10.761 --> 05:11:12.161
MATT: What you got, Cad?

05:11:12.161 --> 05:11:13.711
TALIESIN: Is it my turn?
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

05:11:13.711 --> 05:11:15.177
MATT: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Oh, shit.

05:11:15.177 --> 05:11:16.413
MATT: So what are you doing?

05:11:16.413 --> 05:11:18.401
TALIESIN: I don't know, hold on.

05:11:18.401 --> 05:11:20.726
Uh, that's no good.

05:11:20.726 --> 05:11:23.531
MATT: Then Otis, and then Jester and Fjord on deck.

05:11:23.531 --> 05:11:28.531
LAURA: I have an easy set of actions in my plan, so.

05:11:28.871 --> 05:11:31.996
TALIESIN: I'm going to, 'cause I
don't know what else the fuck to do.

05:11:34.851 --> 05:11:36.229
ASHLEY: Are you still an owl?

05:11:36.229 --> 05:11:40.853
TALIESIN: I'm going to put a Guardian of Faith,

05:11:40.853 --> 05:11:42.278
right in f--

05:11:43.416 --> 05:11:46.791
right on top of the motherfucker
who's on top of us right now.

05:11:48.408 --> 05:11:51.941
MATT: Guardian of Faith right... there?

05:11:53.921 --> 05:11:54.912
TALIESIN: Yeah.

05:11:54.912 --> 05:11:56.767
MATT: Like whereabouts?

05:11:56.767 --> 05:11:59.371
TALIESIN: Right in front to block that person

05:11:59.371 --> 05:12:01.271
who's currently on top of the mammoth.

05:12:02.611 --> 05:12:03.591
MATT: To block <i>them</i>?

05:12:03.591 --> 05:12:05.451
TALIESIN: Yeah, like get in their way.

05:12:05.451 --> 05:12:06.331
MATT: They're right against it,

05:12:06.331 --> 05:12:08.331
so they need to be in an empty space.

05:12:08.331 --> 05:12:11.261
So it wouldn't be able to get between them.

05:12:11.261 --> 05:12:13.774
TALIESIN: Sure, but it'll get--

05:12:13.774 --> 05:12:15.431
they're in contact with it?

05:12:15.431 --> 05:12:16.264
MATT: Correct.

05:12:17.211 --> 05:12:19.628
TALIESIN: In fact, I'll say--
LAURA: That's a cool-ass==

05:12:20.468 --> 05:12:21.301
MATT: Yeah, it's fucking rad.

05:12:21.301 --> 05:12:23.431
TALIESIN: I'll say even 10 feet

05:12:23.431 --> 05:12:25.571
because it's got a little 10-foot radius.

05:12:25.571 --> 05:12:27.701
So I'll try and place it just at the 10-foot radius

05:12:27.701 --> 05:12:29.721
so that we can pass through and it'll,

05:12:29.721 --> 05:12:30.882
it'll get right in there.

05:12:30.882 --> 05:12:32.011
Like there'll be just,

05:12:32.011 --> 05:12:32.931
MATT: You can do that.

05:12:32.931 --> 05:12:35.461
TALIESIN: Yeah, is that-- like, literally between us

05:12:35.461 --> 05:12:37.168
and the rest of those bullshit motherfuckers,

05:12:37.168 --> 05:12:38.301
so they have to, you know--

05:12:38.301 --> 05:12:40.374
SAM: (whispering) Taliesin's cursing. It must be bad.
MATT: Over here you mean?

05:12:40.374 --> 05:12:41.216
TALIESIN: It's hard to--

05:12:42.651 --> 05:12:45.961
yeah, like, about here, yeah.

05:12:45.961 --> 05:12:46.927
MATT: Oh, over here you mean?

05:12:46.927 --> 05:12:50.051
LAURA: So when we run through it, it's blocking us?

05:12:50.051 --> 05:12:52.146
TALIESIN: Yeah, because we can walk
right through without a problem,

05:12:52.146 --> 05:12:53.981
but as long as he's within the 10-foot radius.

05:12:53.981 --> 05:12:54.971
MATT: So like here?

05:12:54.971 --> 05:12:57.203
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah. That way he gets hit right now.

05:12:57.203 --> 05:12:58.036
MATT: Got it, okay.

05:12:58.036 --> 05:13:02.052
TALIESIN: So he needs to make

05:13:02.052 --> 05:13:03.469
a dexterity saving throw.

05:13:03.469 --> 05:13:04.791
MATT: He has to be within 10 feet of it to do that?

05:13:04.791 --> 05:13:06.457
TALIESIN: Yep.
MATT: He's not within 10 feet.

05:13:06.457 --> 05:13:08.189
TALIESIN: Oh, I was trying to hit it so he was

05:13:08.189 --> 05:13:10.507
LIAM: You want it to be 10 feet from him.
MATT: Sorry.

05:13:10.507 --> 05:13:11.340
TALIESIN: Yeah.

05:13:11.340 --> 05:13:13.456
MATT: 10 feet from him would be here,

05:13:13.456 --> 05:13:15.206
to around here, this is the 10-foot radius.

05:13:15.206 --> 05:13:17.347
TALIESIN: In the front, so that if he has to run through it.

05:13:17.347 --> 05:13:18.180
MATT: So like up here?

05:13:18.180 --> 05:13:20.055
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: Okay, got it.

05:13:20.055 --> 05:13:21.972
TALIESIN: So dex saving throw.

05:13:24.473 --> 05:13:27.574
MATT: That is, it's a good roll.

05:13:29.451 --> 05:13:31.034
19.

05:13:31.034 --> 05:13:31.934
TALIESIN: Fuck.

05:13:31.934 --> 05:13:33.642
(laughter)

05:13:33.642 --> 05:13:35.891
LAURA: I like how we rolled so well during the

05:13:35.891 --> 05:13:37.441
dragon fight.
LIAM and MARISHA: Dragon fight.

05:13:37.441 --> 05:13:38.968
LAURA: We used up everything during that.

05:13:38.968 --> 05:13:40.981
TALIESIN: 10 points of radiant damage.

05:13:40.981 --> 05:13:42.781
MATT: 10 points radiant damage, got it.

05:13:42.781 --> 05:13:44.831
All right. Oh, you roll damage for that.
ASHLEY: (squeaky hand sounds)

05:13:44.831 --> 05:13:46.732
TALIESIN: No, it's just straight-up
10 points of radiant damage.

05:13:46.732 --> 05:13:47.957
MATT: Oh, just straight-up. Not even rolled.

05:13:47.957 --> 05:13:48.790
10 points, you got it.

05:13:48.790 --> 05:13:51.081
Okay, that finishes your action.

05:13:51.081 --> 05:13:52.764
You good there?
LAURA: Very nervous farts.

05:13:52.764 --> 05:13:54.280
(laughter)

05:13:54.280 --> 05:13:58.401
ASHLEY: Sorry for my farts.
TALIESIN: I mean, I got everybody.

05:13:58.401 --> 05:14:03.121
Yeah, I mean, yeah that's what I got.

05:14:03.121 --> 05:14:04.421
MATT: All right.

05:14:04.421 --> 05:14:06.346
Ending your turn, Otis stands up.

05:14:06.346 --> 05:14:08.601
He's going to go ahead and cast Eldritch Blast

05:14:08.601 --> 05:14:10.080
towards the mammoth.

05:14:10.080 --> 05:14:11.391
All three of them streak out

05:14:11.391 --> 05:14:13.881
and then (whooshes) vanish

05:14:13.881 --> 05:14:17.960
as they hit the anti-magic cone.

05:14:17.960 --> 05:14:20.099
LAURA: Yes!

05:14:20.099 --> 05:14:21.461
MATT: Otis gets fucking pissed

05:14:21.461 --> 05:14:23.731
and goes ahead and fires a bolt regardless

05:14:23.731 --> 05:14:26.924
at you, who created the creature.

05:14:28.011 --> 05:14:30.921
Is that, that's not concentration, right, the?

05:14:30.921 --> 05:14:31.754
TALIESIN: No.

05:14:33.191 --> 05:14:35.251
MATT: That is going to be a 20 to hit.

05:14:35.251 --> 05:14:36.211
TALIESIN: That's my AC.

05:14:36.211 --> 05:14:37.044
MATT: All right.

05:14:38.211 --> 05:14:39.541
LAURA: Good AC.

05:14:39.541 --> 05:14:43.851
MATT: You take nine points of piercing damage and that's it,

05:14:43.851 --> 05:14:46.161
because it does pass through the zone.

05:14:46.161 --> 05:14:47.711
TALIESIN: Whatever, all right.
MATT: All right.

05:14:47.711 --> 05:14:49.411
Cool, that finishes Otis' go.

05:14:49.411 --> 05:14:52.211
He's going to go ahead and move a little bit closer here.

05:14:52.211 --> 05:14:53.664
Try and keep pace.

05:14:54.697 --> 05:14:55.651
Jester, you're up.

05:14:55.651 --> 05:14:59.261
LAURA: I'm going to fly away with Caduceus in my claws.

05:14:59.261 --> 05:15:00.791
MATT: Okay, your flight speed was 60 normally?

05:15:00.791 --> 05:15:01.915
LAURA: 60.

05:15:01.915 --> 05:15:02.748
MATT: So it's only 30.

05:15:02.748 --> 05:15:04.034
You can double move to go 60.

05:15:04.034 --> 05:15:05.008
LAURA: That's what I'm going to do.

05:15:05.008 --> 05:15:06.091
MATT: You got it.

05:15:07.263 --> 05:15:09.159
SAM: That helps, that helps.

05:15:09.159 --> 05:15:10.733
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: And Caduceus is with me.

05:15:10.733 --> 05:15:14.219
MATT: Yes, now at the end of the turn,
make wisdom saving throw, please.

05:15:14.219 --> 05:15:16.421
LAURA: Oh, well, okay.

05:15:16.421 --> 05:15:18.211
MATT: With a d4 bonus.

05:15:18.211 --> 05:15:19.581
LAURA: Oh, right as an owl.

05:15:19.581 --> 05:15:22.107
MATT: Yeah. Well, d4 because of the Bless that's on you.

05:15:22.107 --> 05:15:23.808
LAURA: Right, right, right.

05:15:23.808 --> 05:15:26.171
That is 13 plus one is 14.

05:15:26.171 --> 05:15:27.231
MATT: 14 does not save.

05:15:27.231 --> 05:15:28.537
TALIESIN: Oh, that's unfortunate.

05:15:28.537 --> 05:15:29.966
MATT: Okay, Fjord.

05:15:31.701 --> 05:15:34.141
TRAVIS: I'm going to prepare to fire an Eldritch Blast

05:15:34.141 --> 05:15:37.851
and then look into the sky and I'll point a finger up

05:15:37.851 --> 05:15:39.431
and you'll hear the flapping

05:15:39.431 --> 05:15:42.631
of giant ancient white dragon wings

05:15:42.631 --> 05:15:45.881
as the dragon has returned to seek vengeance

05:15:45.881 --> 05:15:47.261
and (heavy impact)

05:15:47.261 --> 05:15:49.934
lands with Major Image.

05:15:49.934 --> 05:15:51.300
MARISHA: Come on.
LIAM: Yes.

05:15:51.300 --> 05:15:54.475
TRAVIS: Right over here, outside of the magic cone.

05:15:55.811 --> 05:15:56.644
MARISHA: Come on.

05:15:57.738 --> 05:15:59.161
MATT: (impact)

05:15:59.161 --> 05:16:00.801
SAM: Ooh, it's still got a little blood on it

05:16:00.801 --> 05:16:02.281
to make it look real.

05:16:02.281 --> 05:16:03.247
I like it, I like it.

05:16:03.247 --> 05:16:05.731
TRAVIS: Yeah, maybe, maybe even a little closer to us

05:16:05.731 --> 05:16:07.461
just to sort of--

05:16:07.461 --> 05:16:08.294
MARISHA: Push them away?

05:16:08.294 --> 05:16:10.969
TRAVIS: Yeah. Just to maybe, maybe go,

05:16:10.969 --> 05:16:12.881
it's not worth the chase.

05:16:12.881 --> 05:16:13.714
MATT: You've got it.

05:16:13.714 --> 05:16:16.271
TRAVIS: And that thing bellows and roars

05:16:16.271 --> 05:16:20.321
with misty snow and sleet shooting off of it

05:16:20.321 --> 05:16:23.911
as its wings unfurl all fucking scary as hell.

05:16:23.911 --> 05:16:25.561
MATT: Okay.

05:16:25.561 --> 05:16:29.177
It impacts. The snow bursts around it as it appears,

05:16:29.177 --> 05:16:31.993
and as it (roaring)

05:16:31.993 --> 05:16:35.971
roars into space, you can see the Tomb Takers, "Shit!"

05:16:35.971 --> 05:16:37.816
There is a definitely a visceral reaction

05:16:37.816 --> 05:16:39.281
to the unexpected arrival of this dragon

05:16:39.281 --> 05:16:42.481
in the middle of them gaining ground.

05:16:42.481 --> 05:16:43.441
That finish your turn?

05:16:43.441 --> 05:16:46.861
TRAVIS: I will use my 30 feet to keep coming.

05:16:46.861 --> 05:16:47.841
MATT: Well, you're on the back of the mammoth.

05:16:47.841 --> 05:16:49.082
TRAVIS: I will not do that.

05:16:49.082 --> 05:16:51.299
MATT: Okay. Unless you want to jump off and do it.

05:16:51.299 --> 05:16:52.731
TRAVIS: No, I'm good.
MATT: All righty.

05:16:52.731 --> 05:16:54.731
That brings us to Zoran's turn.

05:16:54.731 --> 05:16:55.564
Zoran.

05:16:56.461 --> 05:16:57.551
TRAVIS: We're all in it together.

05:16:57.551 --> 05:17:00.371
MATT: Just goes ahead and decides to back off.

05:17:00.371 --> 05:17:01.431
LAURA: Good, good, good, good, good.

05:17:01.431 --> 05:17:03.491
MARISHA: Yes.
MATT: Head this way.

05:17:03.491 --> 05:17:06.633
He's like, "Shit, shit, shit! Gah!"

05:17:06.633 --> 05:17:09.291
You see him wrestling with his frustration.

05:17:09.291 --> 05:17:10.491
That brings us to Yasha.

05:17:11.371 --> 05:17:12.204
ASHLEY: Yep.

05:17:12.204 --> 05:17:13.037
MATT: You just keep going?

05:17:13.037 --> 05:17:14.703
LIAM: ? Sail. ?
ASHLEY: Yep.

05:17:14.703 --> 05:17:16.110
ASHLEY: ? Sail ?

05:17:16.110 --> 05:17:17.161
MATT: Distance that way.

05:17:17.161 --> 05:17:17.994
We'll get to that later.

05:17:17.994 --> 05:17:19.416
ASHLEY: ? Come fly away ?

05:17:19.416 --> 05:17:20.911
? Come fly away ?

05:17:20.911 --> 05:17:23.141
MARISHA: Hang on, I've got to dismiss this pop-up ad.

05:17:23.141 --> 05:17:24.421
So I can search for a mammoth.

05:17:24.421 --> 05:17:27.261
Does mammoth have anything, like--

05:17:27.261 --> 05:17:29.386
LAURA: Hold on, let me, I will tell you what mammoth has.

05:17:29.386 --> 05:17:32.261
LIAM: Trample. What do you want besides running?

05:17:32.261 --> 05:17:33.451
MATT: 40-foot movement, right?

05:17:33.451 --> 05:17:35.001
LIAM: Yeah, 40 feet you can move.

05:17:35.001 --> 05:17:37.000
Just go.
TRAVIS: It's got a poop action.

05:17:37.000 --> 05:17:39.401
LAURA: Other than that, it's a trampling charge.

05:17:39.401 --> 05:17:41.241
MARISHA: Yeah, that's why I was asking if there's a trample

05:17:41.241 --> 05:17:42.511
or some sort of pushback.

05:17:42.511 --> 05:17:45.491
But nah, I'll just go 80 feet.

05:17:45.491 --> 05:17:46.741
LIAM: Yeah, it has to be in front of you.

05:17:46.741 --> 05:17:48.524
SAM: Mammoths also have Thunderwave.

05:17:48.524 --> 05:17:49.591
MATT: So you go 40 feet.

05:17:49.591 --> 05:17:54.081
You're slowed, so movement and action is only 40 feet.

05:17:54.081 --> 05:17:56.471
So you're like (slow footsteps).

05:17:56.471 --> 05:17:57.841
Make a another wisdom saving throw.

05:17:57.841 --> 05:18:01.191
MARISHA: Is that slow on the mammoth or is it on Beau?

05:18:01.191 --> 05:18:02.024
MATT: It's on Beau.

05:18:02.981 --> 05:18:03.814
LIAM: Beau, the mammoth.

05:18:03.814 --> 05:18:04.891
MARISHA: What am I doing?

05:18:04.891 --> 05:18:06.741
MATT: Wisdom saving throw at the end of your turn.

05:18:06.741 --> 05:18:11.211
LAURA: You would be able to go-- oh yeah, 40 feet fully.

05:18:11.211 --> 05:18:13.601
MARISHA: I'd be able to go faster as Beau even as I'm-- no.

05:18:13.601 --> 05:18:14.601
MATT: Okay, still slowed.

05:18:15.911 --> 05:18:16.744
Veth.

05:18:17.601 --> 05:18:19.988
SAM: Oh, I mean, I'm super far ahead.

05:18:19.988 --> 05:18:20.821
MATT: For the record,

05:18:20.821 --> 05:18:23.733
all of you guys also see this dragon land.

05:18:23.733 --> 05:18:25.333
SAM and LAURA: (fake screaming)

05:18:25.333 --> 05:18:27.049
(laughter)

05:18:27.049 --> 05:18:29.053
LAURA: Keep running!
LIAM: It just keeps getting worse!

05:18:29.053 --> 05:18:32.202
MATT: Yeah, yeah, you are shitting your pants on this.

05:18:32.202 --> 05:18:33.201
Because even though it was Fjord,

05:18:33.201 --> 05:18:35.481
like without any fair warning or plan,

05:18:35.481 --> 05:18:39.291
as far as most of you know, the dragon just returned.

05:18:39.291 --> 05:18:40.971
This is the worst day.

05:18:40.971 --> 05:18:43.011
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MARISHA: Make it really convincing.

05:18:43.011 --> 05:18:47.016
SAM: Aren't the bad guys within a hundred feet of me?

05:18:47.016 --> 05:18:49.041
MATT: It looks like most of them.

05:18:49.904 --> 05:18:50.921
SAM: Oh, most of them?

05:18:50.921 --> 05:18:52.151
MATT: Most of them, yeah.

05:18:52.151 --> 05:18:54.961
LIAM: Yeah, you've got one person like 20 feet away.

05:18:54.961 --> 05:18:57.391
25 feet away.
MARISHA: Yeah, you've got Tyffial.

05:18:57.391 --> 05:18:58.741
MATT: Tyffial's right there.

05:18:58.741 --> 05:19:03.341
There's Otis, there's Cree over there,
who has the Slow spell on everyone else.

05:19:03.341 --> 05:19:05.241
There's Zoran. Yeah, they're all pretty much

05:19:05.241 --> 05:19:06.101
within a hundred.

05:19:06.101 --> 05:19:07.596
TALIESIN: Oh!
LAURA: Oh, Cree's the one

05:19:07.596 --> 05:19:08.841
that did the Slow spell?

05:19:08.841 --> 05:19:09.791
TALIESIN: Good to know.

05:19:09.791 --> 05:19:12.131
SAM: Cree is-- is Cree within a hundred feet of,

05:19:12.131 --> 05:19:13.111
120 feet of me?

05:19:13.111 --> 05:19:15.034
LIAM: Within 120 feet of you, yeah.
MATT: Most likely, yeah.

05:19:15.034 --> 05:19:19.653
SAM: Okay, I will fire a crossbow bolt at Cree.

05:19:19.653 --> 05:19:20.551
18.

05:19:20.551 --> 05:19:22.226
MATT: 18 hits.
SAM: Okay.

05:19:22.226 --> 05:19:23.341
There's no sneak attack,

05:19:23.341 --> 05:19:24.571
but maybe this will

05:19:24.571 --> 05:19:27.226
force a concentration hit?
MATT: Yeah, 18 just hits.

05:19:27.226 --> 05:19:29.438
SAM: Six plus six is--

05:19:29.438 --> 05:19:30.465
LAURA: 12.

05:19:30.465 --> 05:19:32.017
SAM: Is 12, thank you.

05:19:32.017 --> 05:19:32.941
MATT: 12 points of damage.

05:19:32.941 --> 05:19:36.341
SAM: 12 points. Concentration check?

05:19:36.341 --> 05:19:38.371
Maybe? I don't know. Is Slow a concentration?

05:19:38.371 --> 05:19:40.117
I have no idea.
MARISHA: It is.

05:19:40.117 --> 05:19:40.950
I think it is.

05:19:40.950 --> 05:19:41.901
LIAM: It is a concentration.

05:19:41.901 --> 05:19:43.192
MATT: How many points did you do again?
SAM: 12 points.

05:19:43.192 --> 05:19:44.892
MATT: 12 points. Rolled an 11 on the same throw,

05:19:44.892 --> 05:19:48.259
I'm not even joking.

05:19:48.259 --> 05:19:50.331
Really low roll plus bonuses, one below.

05:19:50.331 --> 05:19:51.963
You are so fucking lucky.

05:19:51.963 --> 05:19:52.921
SAM: (cackles)

05:19:52.921 --> 05:19:53.949
MATT: Slow drops.

05:19:53.949 --> 05:19:54.782
LIAM: Oh.

05:19:56.451 --> 05:19:57.294
SAM: Then I run.

05:19:58.410 --> 05:20:01.361
? I run ?
LIAM: ? So far away ?

05:20:01.361 --> 05:20:02.661
MATT: We're--

05:20:02.661 --> 05:20:06.411
We're getting to a fulcrum.

05:20:06.411 --> 05:20:09.121
We'll see here who can make the rest of the way.

05:20:09.121 --> 05:20:10.761
And you would be, Caduceus.

05:20:10.761 --> 05:20:13.401
TALIESIN: I'm-- yeah.
MATT: Okay, put you here.

05:20:13.401 --> 05:20:14.234
MATT: All right.

05:20:16.081 --> 05:20:19.652
That brings us to Tyffial, who sees--

05:20:19.652 --> 05:20:21.521
who's going to go ahead and try and run around this way.

05:20:21.521 --> 05:20:23.501
TALIESIN: Still going to start at, starts his turn.

05:20:23.501 --> 05:20:24.334
MATT: Her turn, yeah.

05:20:24.334 --> 05:20:25.917
TALIESIN: So--

05:20:26.800 --> 05:20:30.061
All look like tiny little balls of death right now.

05:20:30.061 --> 05:20:31.311
So that's a--

05:20:31.311 --> 05:20:32.941
MATT: Dex save?
TALIESIN: Dex save.

05:20:32.941 --> 05:20:34.381
That's really-- they're rolling really bad

05:20:34.381 --> 05:20:35.271
at the last minute.

05:20:35.271 --> 05:20:36.962
That puts--
LAURA: Hey, so are we.

05:20:36.962 --> 05:20:39.101
MATT: Tyffial-- yeah, fair enough-- at six.

05:20:39.101 --> 05:20:41.281
TALIESIN: That's 20 points of radiant damage right there.

05:20:41.281 --> 05:20:43.472
TRAVIS: Home. Just go home.

05:20:43.472 --> 05:20:45.052
You don't need to come this way.

05:20:45.052 --> 05:20:46.235
MATT: Any other effects, or was that it?

05:20:46.235 --> 05:20:50.644
TALIESIN: Um, uh.

05:20:53.601 --> 05:20:54.984
Yep, no, you're--

05:20:56.261 --> 05:20:58.459
SAM: It's all because Ashley rolled an eight.

05:20:58.459 --> 05:20:59.292
TALIESIN: That's it.

05:20:59.292 --> 05:21:00.531
(laughter)

05:21:00.531 --> 05:21:02.541
But it's a big fucking thing, so.

05:21:02.541 --> 05:21:03.947
(laughter)

05:21:03.947 --> 05:21:06.921
MATT: Tyffial's going to, biding time

05:21:06.921 --> 05:21:08.513
in seeing Zoran and walk back,

05:21:08.513 --> 05:21:11.921
is going to go ahead and use the turn to run back this way.

05:21:11.921 --> 05:21:12.754
MARISHA: Okay.

05:21:12.754 --> 05:21:13.841
MATT: All right.
SAM: We're out.

05:21:13.841 --> 05:21:15.389
ASHLEY: Oops, my bad.

05:21:15.389 --> 05:21:16.781
TALIESIN: Maybe.

05:21:16.781 --> 05:21:19.431
MATT: Brings it to Caleb's go.

05:21:19.431 --> 05:21:21.101
LIAM: My go?

05:21:21.101 --> 05:21:22.651
SAM: Turns around and runs back in.

05:21:22.651 --> 05:21:23.821
LIAM: There's not much I can do.

05:21:23.821 --> 05:21:28.091
I am throwing a Fireball into the heart of their party.

05:21:28.091 --> 05:21:28.981
Past the dragon.

05:21:28.981 --> 05:21:31.531
I will aim it around where that mage hand is.

05:21:31.531 --> 05:21:34.568
So it gets Cree, Lucien.

05:21:34.568 --> 05:21:35.401
We will do it.

05:21:35.401 --> 05:21:36.421
MATT: Okay.

05:21:36.421 --> 05:21:37.254
MARISHA: Get Otis.

05:21:37.254 --> 05:21:40.796
MATT: As you fire the beam, you point out and go (whooshes).

05:21:40.796 --> 05:21:44.295
And the beam goes (sizzling) and just disappears.
LIAM: Beam? Fireball?

05:21:44.295 --> 05:21:47.986
MATT: Fireball. Fireball is you point.

05:21:47.986 --> 05:21:50.291
LIAM: Into his eyeball view?

05:21:50.291 --> 05:21:52.821
MATT: Correct. There is a--

05:21:52.821 --> 05:21:55.021
TALIESIN: It's not a drop from above?

05:21:55.021 --> 05:21:58.979
LIAM: No. It's a little mote that goes (zooming).

05:21:58.979 --> 05:22:01.212
MATT: Yeah, so you aim and the mote goes (whooshes).

05:22:01.212 --> 05:22:02.121
LIAM: Got it.

05:22:02.121 --> 05:22:04.351
MATT: So the mote just fizzles out in midair.

05:22:04.351 --> 05:22:05.184
LIAM: Got it.

05:22:05.184 --> 05:22:07.684
SAM: Okay, okay, okay. Worth it.

05:22:07.684 --> 05:22:09.931
LIAM: Bonus action, I will continue to be a little twig boy

05:22:09.931 --> 05:22:11.561
in the arms of a barbarian woman.

05:22:11.561 --> 05:22:12.674
MATT: You got it, okay.

05:22:12.674 --> 05:22:15.159
(chuckles)

05:22:15.159 --> 05:22:16.768
Top of this round.

05:22:16.768 --> 05:22:18.151
Lucien's going to go ahead and move forward.

05:22:18.151 --> 05:22:19.261
ASHLEY: Is a good boy.

05:22:20.301 --> 05:22:23.171
MATT: And as everyone's vanishing into the darkness,

05:22:23.171 --> 05:22:25.324
you can see him walk forward,

05:22:26.191 --> 05:22:30.601
looking over at the dragon, shakes his head.

05:22:30.601 --> 05:22:35.521
And goes, "Sometimes you're all a serious piece of shit,

05:22:35.521 --> 05:22:36.551
"you know that?"

05:22:36.551 --> 05:22:37.571
As he glances over,

05:22:37.571 --> 05:22:41.644
you watch as the dragon (whooshes) vanishes.

05:22:42.771 --> 05:22:44.161
However, at this point

05:22:44.161 --> 05:22:45.891
they're starting to back off

05:22:45.891 --> 05:22:47.241
and you get the sense right now

05:22:47.241 --> 05:22:51.544
that you've just barely scraped by,

05:22:53.361 --> 05:22:56.451
as you all go charging into the darkness in shadow

05:22:56.451 --> 05:23:01.451
of the freezing snow in cold, exhausted, shaken,

05:23:02.731 --> 05:23:06.491
and uncertain if they're going to continue pursuit,

05:23:06.491 --> 05:23:07.541
once they've rallied.

05:23:09.281 --> 05:23:11.158
We're going to go ahead and pick up next week.

05:23:11.158 --> 05:23:12.909
SAM: Oh.

05:23:12.909 --> 05:23:14.631
LIAM: Got our asses handed to us.

05:23:14.631 --> 05:23:17.665
LAURA: Yep. They have our Bag of Holding still.

05:23:17.665 --> 05:23:18.741
MATT: I didn't mean for this to go that long.

05:23:18.741 --> 05:23:20.011
Things worked out in a way.

05:23:20.011 --> 05:23:22.261
Thank you all for hanging with us for the length of this.

05:23:22.261 --> 05:23:23.617
SAM: Thank you, crew.

05:23:23.617 --> 05:23:26.215
MATT: Thank you, crew for hanging with us.

05:23:26.215 --> 05:23:28.421
MARISHA: What was that, a five and a half hour game?

05:23:28.421 --> 05:23:29.821
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: I don't know.

05:23:29.821 --> 05:23:31.353
ASHLEY: Like our home games back in the day.

05:23:31.353 --> 05:23:32.319
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

05:23:32.319 --> 05:23:33.269
MARISHA: Almost for, like, eight hours

05:23:33.269 --> 05:23:35.651
LAURA: That was almost a six hour game.
MARISHA: It might be a record.

05:23:35.651 --> 05:23:37.451
MATT: We'll see, with breaks and everything

05:23:37.451 --> 05:23:39.529
and it'll cut it down.

05:23:39.529 --> 05:23:42.851
But nevertheless, thank you for hanging with us.

05:23:42.851 --> 05:23:44.949
We'll see where this picks up next week.

05:23:44.949 --> 05:23:49.111
But-- get off this intense music for the ending here.

05:23:49.111 --> 05:23:51.773
MARISHA: No, it feels comforting.

05:23:51.773 --> 05:23:53.371
TRAVIS: I couldn't Counterspell the Slow,

05:23:53.371 --> 05:23:55.451
otherwise I wouldn't have been able to dragon.

05:23:55.451 --> 05:23:56.710
MATT: Yeah, it was a good call.

05:23:56.710 --> 05:23:58.741
MARISHA: It worked great. That was fucking clutch.

05:23:58.741 --> 05:24:00.648
LAURA: They backed off because of it.

05:24:00.648 --> 05:24:03.621
MATT: But nevertheless, thank you all for joining us.

05:24:03.621 --> 05:24:05.011
Thank you for hanging with us

05:24:05.011 --> 05:24:08.595
for this longer episode than I think any of us anticipated.

05:24:08.595 --> 05:24:09.541
We love you very much.

05:24:09.541 --> 05:24:10.929
And is it Thursday yet?

05:24:10.929 --> 05:24:11.802
Good night.
(whimpering)

05:24:11.802 --> 05:24:12.635
LAURA: Oh no.

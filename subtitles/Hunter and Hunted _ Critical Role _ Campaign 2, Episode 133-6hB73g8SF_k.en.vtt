00:00:00.547 --> 00:00:01.380
MATT: Hello everybody,

00:00:01.381 --> 00:00:02.974
and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role,

00:00:02.975 --> 00:00:04.609
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass
voice actors sit around

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:05.886
and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:05.887 --> 00:00:09.509
ALL: (hollering) We play
Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.626
MATT: Jesus.

00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:14.256
Before we jump into tonight's show,

00:00:14.257 --> 00:00:15.956
we do have some announcements
to get through,

00:00:15.957 --> 00:00:17.296
beginning with our
first of our sponsors,

00:00:17.297 --> 00:00:19.816
our friends at Hit Point Press, Sam.

00:00:19.817 --> 00:00:21.326
SAM: Okay, before I do the ad

00:00:21.327 --> 00:00:23.356
for Hit Point Press tonight,
some quick business.

00:00:23.357 --> 00:00:25.692
When I pitched the idea
for tonight's skit,

00:00:25.693 --> 00:00:27.754
our producers called
in our team of lawyers

00:00:27.755 --> 00:00:30.576
to make sure that it
was going to be okay.

00:00:30.577 --> 00:00:33.536
After debating it for
about 36 billable hours,

00:00:33.537 --> 00:00:35.696
the attorneys said, "Yes."

00:00:35.697 --> 00:00:37.696
On one condition.

00:00:37.697 --> 00:00:41.036
I am supposed to read a small
disclaimer at the beginning.

00:00:41.037 --> 00:00:42.256
(clears throat)

00:00:42.257 --> 00:00:44.126
Disclaimer: Tonight's advertisement,

00:00:44.127 --> 00:00:47.106
nor anything Sam ever says,
has been approved, vetted, read,

00:00:47.107 --> 00:00:48.786
or dictated by tonight's sponsor.

00:00:48.787 --> 00:00:50.046
Hit Point Press has no idea

00:00:50.047 --> 00:00:52.006
what Sam will say, do,
smear on his body,

00:00:52.007 --> 00:00:54.086
or consume through any orifice.

00:00:54.087 --> 00:00:56.096
Hit Point Press has
never met Sam Riegel.

00:00:56.097 --> 00:00:58.236
However, in our legal
opinion, if they did,

00:00:58.237 --> 00:00:59.776
they would ghost him.

00:00:59.777 --> 00:01:02.086
None of Critical Role's
advertisers condone any

00:01:02.087 --> 00:01:03.106
of the following:

00:01:03.107 --> 00:01:05.166
plant fornication, hair mutilation,

00:01:05.167 --> 00:01:08.226
consuming wine with yogurt,
surfer dudes,

00:01:08.227 --> 00:01:11.166
astronaut mockery,
mouth stuff, hand stuff,

00:01:11.167 --> 00:01:15.086
feet stuff, football blood,
or male presenting nipples.

00:01:15.087 --> 00:01:16.696
The following skit is not recommended

00:01:16.697 --> 00:01:19.946
for children under 17,
adults over 39, the elderly,

00:01:19.947 --> 00:01:22.896
Gen X-ers, Boomers, nerds,
jocks, band geeks, floaters,

00:01:22.897 --> 00:01:26.916
otakus, stoners, sportos,
motorheads, geeks, wastoids,

00:01:26.917 --> 00:01:29.246
dweebies, dickheads, or cats.

00:01:29.247 --> 00:01:31.456
Parental discretion is advised.

00:01:31.457 --> 00:01:33.346
Do not taunt Happy Fun Ball.

00:01:33.347 --> 00:01:35.656
Coastal flooding is in
effect until sundown.

00:01:35.657 --> 00:01:37.276
Check yourself before
you wreck yourself.

00:01:37.277 --> 00:01:38.197
All rights reserved.

00:01:38.198 --> 00:01:41.106
Okay, I'm ready for the skit.

00:01:41.107 --> 00:01:44.296
Go ahead, Ashley, get yourself ready.

00:01:44.297 --> 00:01:45.636
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:01:45.637 --> 00:01:50.637
SAM: And this is going to make
Hit Point Press so impressed.

00:01:51.177 --> 00:01:52.381
Ready?
LAURA: What?

00:01:52.382 --> 00:01:53.598
TALIESIN: Jesus.

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:54.470
SAM: Aim.

00:01:54.471 --> 00:01:56.620
LAURA: No, no.
ASHLEY: All right, here we go.

00:01:58.187 --> 00:01:59.377
MATT: (stuttering) No, what-- wait no,

00:01:59.378 --> 00:02:01.235
we are out of time for this.

00:02:01.236 --> 00:02:02.686
Sorry, Sam.

00:02:02.687 --> 00:02:05.256
SAM: Oh really? What? Why?

00:02:05.257 --> 00:02:08.114
MATT: Don't worry, I'll
read the copy for you.

00:02:08.115 --> 00:02:10.130
Ashley, put it down.

00:02:10.131 --> 00:02:13.156
(throat clear) So this episode is
sponsored by Big Bads,

00:02:13.157 --> 00:02:15.663
a monthly booklet by our
friends at Hit Point Press

00:02:15.664 --> 00:02:17.796
about boss monsters for fifth edition.

00:02:17.797 --> 00:02:20.526
The booklet includes details
about their backstory, tactics,

00:02:20.527 --> 00:02:22.656
stats, and more for great
monsters you can incorporate

00:02:22.657 --> 00:02:24.226
into any of your games.

00:02:24.227 --> 00:02:26.985
This month meet Captain Fulmini.

00:02:26.986 --> 00:02:29.370
She's a vampire pirate
who can harness the power

00:02:29.371 --> 00:02:32.903
of the high seas with an
unquenchable thirst for revenge.

00:02:32.904 --> 00:02:33.847
Arr!

00:02:33.848 --> 00:02:36.596
You can find out more and
sign up at bigbads.com,

00:02:36.597 --> 00:02:39.336
but move fast because you must
sign up at the end of April

00:02:39.337 --> 00:02:42.346
to receive the Captain
in all of her glory

00:02:42.347 --> 00:02:44.036
and get this in your rewards.

00:02:44.037 --> 00:02:46.946
So thank you so much to Hit Point Press

00:02:46.947 --> 00:02:49.111
and Jesus Christ,

00:02:49.112 --> 00:02:50.386
don't do that.
SAM: I feel like we had plenty

00:02:50.387 --> 00:02:51.586
of time to shoot an apple

00:02:51.587 --> 00:02:52.474
off my head.
MATT: No, we're real rushed.

00:02:52.474 --> 00:02:53.307
ASHLEY: Oh, for sure could have gotten it.

00:02:53.308 --> 00:02:54.466
MATT: Real, real rushed.

00:02:54.467 --> 00:02:56.116
We had to get through this,
a lot to talk about.

00:02:56.117 --> 00:02:57.306
Thank you, Sam.

00:02:57.307 --> 00:02:58.789
Thank you, Hit Point Press.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:59.623
(throat clear)

00:03:01.487 --> 00:03:04.147
Our second sponsor tonight is Starcane,

00:03:05.297 --> 00:03:07.366
sponsored by Penny Dragon Games

00:03:07.367 --> 00:03:08.416
and their newly launched campaign

00:03:08.417 --> 00:03:11.426
for Aizendore's Vault
of Tragic Treasure,

00:03:11.427 --> 00:03:14.746
which features two fifth edition
compatible books, STLs,

00:03:14.747 --> 00:03:16.243
and a lot more.

00:03:16.244 --> 00:03:17.546
Aizendore's Vault,

00:03:17.547 --> 00:03:18.756
I believe it's pronounced--

00:03:18.757 --> 00:03:20.316
Aizendore's Vault is
laden with magical items

00:03:20.317 --> 00:03:22.236
of the tragic variety to be used

00:03:22.237 --> 00:03:24.646
at one's own risk in your own games.

00:03:24.647 --> 00:03:26.075
They also have an original adventure,

00:03:26.076 --> 00:03:28.776
Order of Elemental Chaos
as part of their campaign,

00:03:28.777 --> 00:03:30.676
which features an item
from the Aizendore's Vault

00:03:30.677 --> 00:03:32.326
and introduces players
to the elemental planes

00:03:32.327 --> 00:03:35.236
of air, fire, water, and
earth before hurling them

00:03:35.237 --> 00:03:37.096
into the elemental chaos itself.

00:03:37.097 --> 00:03:39.446
And their first STL pack
for creature encounters

00:03:39.447 --> 00:03:40.697
in chapter one,
Plunder and Lightening, is free

00:03:42.217 --> 00:03:44.496
for all current campaign supporters.

00:03:44.497 --> 00:03:46.926
You can find everything and
more about the campaign now

00:03:46.927 --> 00:03:51.927
over at bit.ly, that's
bit.ly/crpennydragon

00:03:52.032 --> 00:03:54.506
and use code "critrole10," one word,

00:03:54.507 --> 00:03:56.646
in the pledge manager to
get $10 off your pledge

00:03:56.647 --> 00:03:59.136
of a hundred dollars or more.

00:03:59.137 --> 00:04:02.156
And our final sponsor for
the night, our friends

00:04:02.157 --> 00:04:03.357
at D&amp;D Beyond, who've been with us

00:04:03.358 --> 00:04:06.293
since the beginning of Campaign 2.
ALL: ♪ D&amp;D Beyond! ♪

00:04:06.294 --> 00:04:08.206
MATT: The official tool set of our show.

00:04:08.207 --> 00:04:10.206
An amazing online digital
tool for keeping all

00:04:10.207 --> 00:04:12.226
the information about your
campaigns, your characters,

00:04:12.227 --> 00:04:14.066
and everything in-between.

00:04:14.067 --> 00:04:15.366
You can get up to six
characters for free.

00:04:15.367 --> 00:04:16.716
With a subscription, there is no limits

00:04:16.717 --> 00:04:17.667
to how many characters.

00:04:17.668 --> 00:04:18.786
I have far too many in there

00:04:18.787 --> 00:04:20.236
that I'll never have a chance to play.

00:04:20.237 --> 00:04:21.686
Many of you know my pain.

00:04:21.687 --> 00:04:23.756
Anyway, they're awesome,
check them out if you haven't yet.

00:04:23.757 --> 00:04:24.657
Thank you so much.

00:04:25.697 --> 00:04:27.256
Marisha, you have an
announcement, I believe.

00:04:27.257 --> 00:04:28.666
MARISHA: I do.

00:04:28.667 --> 00:04:33.605
Thank you for joining us
live on Twitch and YouTube.

00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:37.206

00:04:40.407 --> 00:04:44.026
MATT: All right.
(laughter)

00:04:44.027 --> 00:04:45.671
MARISHA: And!
LAURA: There's more.

00:04:45.672 --> 00:04:48.004
MARISHA: Tomorrow,
(laughter)

00:04:48.005 --> 00:04:49.447
Almost, don't cut away.

00:04:50.667 --> 00:04:54.506
Join us for chill music and

the VOD will be available

00:05:03.057 --> 00:05:04.790
Sunday, April 11th.

00:05:05.937 --> 00:05:07.296
The vibes.

00:05:07.297 --> 00:05:08.836
Now you can cut away.

00:05:08.837 --> 00:05:10.713
MATT: There you go.

00:05:10.714 --> 00:05:12.446
And to finish up, I believe
we have some announcements

00:05:12.447 --> 00:05:14.736
from Laura Bailey.

00:05:14.737 --> 00:05:16.574
BAFTA Award-winning Laura Bailey.

00:05:17.487 --> 00:05:19.416
LAURA: I'm here to tell you
that our Critical Role--

00:05:19.417 --> 00:05:21.206
Why do I suck so bad at this?

00:05:21.207 --> 00:05:23.696
Our Critical Role version of Munchkin,

00:05:23.697 --> 00:05:25.656
featuring the Mighty Nein.

00:05:25.657 --> 00:05:27.356
I wish I had it to
hold up for you guys,

00:05:27.357 --> 00:05:28.586
but you can look at it online.

00:05:28.587 --> 00:05:31.383
It is available now from
our friends at The Op.

00:05:31.384 --> 00:05:34.786
Munchkin Critical Role is
a standalone 172-card game

00:05:34.787 --> 00:05:36.626
with art and imaginative aspects

00:05:36.627 --> 00:05:38.526
from both Munchkin and Critical Role

00:05:38.527 --> 00:05:42.066
with 160-- I'm bad--
custom illustrations

00:05:42.067 --> 00:05:47.067
from the incredible
Elena Muñoz and Tyler Hostettler.

00:05:47.237 --> 00:05:49.492
I said both those names perfectly.

00:05:49.493 --> 00:05:51.506
MATT: (laughs)
ASHLEY: Perfectly.

00:05:51.507 --> 00:05:52.936
LAURA: Seriously, the art,

00:05:52.937 --> 00:05:54.346
you've seen it all.
MATT: The art's incredible.

00:05:54.347 --> 00:05:55.438
LAURA: It's amazing.

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:57.226
LIAM: It's pretty, super pretty.

00:05:57.227 --> 00:06:01.906
LAURA: It's available now at local
game stores at the US, UK,

00:06:01.907 --> 00:06:04.996
and Australian Critical Role
shops online.

00:06:04.997 --> 00:06:07.950
And of course from
The Op's online shop as well.

00:06:08.827 --> 00:06:10.616
But wait, I have
something else to say.

00:06:10.617 --> 00:06:13.126
SAM: Oh! Oh, okay.
(laughter)

00:06:13.127 --> 00:06:15.826
LAURA: Our Vox Machina T-shirt, designed

00:06:15.827 --> 00:06:19.055
by Bryan Weiss, is available
in our Australian shop.

00:06:19.056 --> 00:06:22.271
(cheering)

00:06:22.272 --> 00:06:23.706
LAURA: That's it, that's what I got.

00:06:23.707 --> 00:06:24.856
MATT: Look at that, you did it in one.

00:06:24.857 --> 00:06:25.876
Well done, Laura.

00:06:25.877 --> 00:06:26.710
LAURA: Thanks.
TRAVIS: (clapping)

00:06:26.711 --> 00:06:29.153
MATT: Well done, proud of you.

00:06:30.087 --> 00:06:32.243
SAM: She gets applause for some reason.

00:06:32.244 --> 00:06:34.006
(laughter)

00:06:34.007 --> 00:06:36.830
SAM: We all did announcements,
she gets applause, okay.

00:06:37.952 --> 00:06:40.256
LAURA: Be at the end, Sam,
and you'll get them, too.

00:06:40.257 --> 00:06:42.396
MATT: Well, I believe that's
the end of our announcements.

00:06:42.397 --> 00:06:45.887
So let's go ahead and jump
into tonight's episode of

00:06:46.774 --> 00:06:49.827

(flames whooshing)

00:08:25.211 --> 00:08:26.543
MATT: Welcome back.

00:08:26.544 --> 00:08:30.056
So last we left off: The Mighty Nein

00:08:30.057 --> 00:08:32.346
have made their way back to Eiselcross,

00:08:32.347 --> 00:08:36.734
intent to catch up to or
cut off the Tomb Takers

00:08:36.735 --> 00:08:40.156
from their journey into the
depths of the Aeorian ruins.

00:08:40.157 --> 00:08:42.276
The great city of mages from

00:08:42.277 --> 00:08:44.666
before the Calamity
that lies long buried

00:08:44.667 --> 00:08:47.540
beneath the ice and
snow of the continent.

00:08:48.427 --> 00:08:51.552
You've convinced
Essek Thelyss, the shadowhand

00:08:51.553 --> 00:08:55.006
of the Kryn Dynasty to
accompany you along this journey.

00:08:55.007 --> 00:08:57.226
Upon finding the hidden
entrance the Tomb Takers

00:08:57.227 --> 00:08:58.620
had previously utilized,

00:08:59.827 --> 00:09:03.252
given to you by a
successful Divine Intervention,

00:09:03.253 --> 00:09:07.246
you discovered that other
strange magics were afoot nearby

00:09:07.247 --> 00:09:10.307
as necromantic energies
triggered or at least

00:09:11.247 --> 00:09:16.136
your presence uncovered
some undead frost giants.

00:09:16.137 --> 00:09:18.686
They attacked you
immediately, did some battle,

00:09:18.687 --> 00:09:21.410
but you managed to, aside from Jester,

00:09:21.411 --> 00:09:23.646
get through fairly unscathed

00:09:23.647 --> 00:09:25.487
and begin to delve within

00:09:26.637 --> 00:09:28.996
the subterranean ruins themselves,

00:09:28.997 --> 00:09:32.906
heading through the tightly
enclosed spaces, the ruined rock

00:09:32.907 --> 00:09:37.786
and frost, eventually
finding a collapsed pit.

00:09:37.787 --> 00:09:39.346
And at the base of it

00:09:39.347 --> 00:09:42.406
what looked to be a
long-forgotten, ruined courtyard

00:09:42.407 --> 00:09:45.178
and the first sign of this space,

00:09:45.179 --> 00:09:47.216
of the Aeorian civilization.

00:09:47.217 --> 00:09:51.496
Here, you messed around
with some brown mold.

00:09:51.497 --> 00:09:54.096
You accidentally collapsed a tower.

00:09:54.097 --> 00:09:58.626
You (laughs) began to
plot some possible means

00:09:58.627 --> 00:10:00.567
of setting some traps
for your quarry,

00:10:01.427 --> 00:10:04.926
and then found your way
up a nearby hallway,

00:10:04.927 --> 00:10:08.246
familiar to some of the
previous ruins you had come across.

00:10:08.247 --> 00:10:09.080
And as you took a moment

00:10:09.081 --> 00:10:11.430
to break near an intersection to rest,

00:10:12.387 --> 00:10:15.026
it was discovered a
creature that had been

00:10:15.027 --> 00:10:16.936
stirred by your presence crawling

00:10:16.937 --> 00:10:18.966
from the ceiling duct nearby

00:10:18.967 --> 00:10:23.768
dropping into the ground and
preparing to attack you all.

00:10:23.769 --> 00:10:26.776
So, first, let's go ahead and figure out

00:10:26.777 --> 00:10:28.446
where you all are placed.
SAM: Ooh.

00:10:28.447 --> 00:10:30.854
MATT: So looking here.

00:10:30.855 --> 00:10:32.844
Caduceus was right around this corner.

00:10:32.845 --> 00:10:33.753
TALIESIN: Yep.

00:10:34.897 --> 00:10:36.126
MATT: Jester, you were kind of--

00:10:36.127 --> 00:10:37.503
LAURA: I was like against the wall.

00:10:37.504 --> 00:10:38.891
MATT: Which one?

00:10:38.892 --> 00:10:41.109
LAURA: Sure, that one.
MATT: All righty.

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:42.525
SAM: (like Laura) Sure.
TRAVIS: I had shaken

00:10:42.526 --> 00:10:44.366
Jester out of her communion.

00:10:44.367 --> 00:10:45.327
MATT: Indeed.
LAURA: Oh, that's true,

00:10:45.327 --> 00:10:46.196
so you were right next to me.

00:10:46.197 --> 00:10:48.456
MATT: Fjord would be right there.

00:10:48.457 --> 00:10:49.663
LAURA: Communion. (laughs)

00:10:49.664 --> 00:10:51.721
TRAVIS: What is it called?
LAURA: Commune.

00:10:51.722 --> 00:10:53.396
TRAVIS: Eh, whatever.
MATT: It's close enough.

00:10:53.397 --> 00:10:54.726
Caleb, where would you be?

00:10:54.727 --> 00:10:56.536
LIAM: Not into the middle
of the intersection,

00:10:56.537 --> 00:10:58.035
but right on the edge of it.
ASHLEY: Put that wafer down.

00:10:58.036 --> 00:10:59.619
MATT: Like right there?

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:01.916
LIAM: Yeah, maybe a little
more towards the center.

00:11:01.917 --> 00:11:02.750
MATT: Right there?

00:11:02.751 --> 00:11:05.556
LIAM: And then back towards you, 10 feet.

00:11:05.557 --> 00:11:06.481
MATT: 10 feet, there?
LIAM: Yeah.

00:11:06.482 --> 00:11:07.706
MATT: You got it.

00:11:07.707 --> 00:11:09.067
Okay, Yasha?

00:11:09.907 --> 00:11:13.686
ASHLEY: Okay, let's stand
over by that other wall.

00:11:13.687 --> 00:11:15.161
The other just--

00:11:15.162 --> 00:11:17.380
MATT: Over here?
ASHLEY: Closer to you? No--

00:11:17.381 --> 00:11:18.239
MATT: This was the intersection

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.535
that nobody had crossed
yet except for Caduceus

00:11:20.536 --> 00:11:21.554
began to look into it.

00:11:21.555 --> 00:11:23.106
So whereabouts in here?

00:11:23.107 --> 00:11:24.406
ASHLEY: Yep, that's perfect.

00:11:24.407 --> 00:11:25.456
MATT: Sure, there we go.

00:11:25.457 --> 00:11:27.330
All righty, Beauregard?

00:11:27.331 --> 00:11:31.436
MARISHA: I'll be also with
the Team Caduceus party.

00:11:31.437 --> 00:11:33.146
MATT: Okay, over here?
MARISHA: Oh yeah.

00:11:33.147 --> 00:11:34.606
Yeah, I guess.

00:11:34.607 --> 00:11:36.081
MATT: All righty, Veth?

00:11:36.082 --> 00:11:38.856
SAM: I seem to remember
talking to Yasha.

00:11:38.857 --> 00:11:40.056
So near her.

00:11:40.057 --> 00:11:41.310
MATT: Sure, we'll put you right there.
TALIESIN: Wow, we are in a line,

00:11:41.311 --> 00:11:42.893
aren't we?
LAURA: Hmm.

00:11:42.894 --> 00:11:43.769
MATT: We'll put Essek--
LAURA: Well, we were

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:44.921
kind of clumped, so.

00:11:44.922 --> 00:11:46.737
MATT: Essek likely right there.
TALIESIN: It's a hallway.

00:11:46.738 --> 00:11:49.188
LIAM: Hallway. Classic hallway.

00:11:50.257 --> 00:11:51.816
MATT: Well.

00:11:51.817 --> 00:11:53.236
LAURA: Well.
SAM: Ooh.

00:11:53.237 --> 00:11:54.990
LAURA: Cool, cool, cool.

00:11:54.991 --> 00:11:56.906
SAM: Oh, wait, he came
from that direction?

00:11:56.907 --> 00:11:57.890
LAURA: Yes.
SAM: Goddamn it.

00:11:57.891 --> 00:11:59.626
MATT: Because Caduceus
looked back this way

00:11:59.627 --> 00:12:02.446
and then it dropped from the
ceiling right behind you.

00:12:02.447 --> 00:12:04.786
TALIESIN: In that case,
I curled around the wall.

00:12:04.787 --> 00:12:05.737
MATT: You curled around this way?

00:12:05.738 --> 00:12:07.086
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:12:07.087 --> 00:12:09.296
LIAM: And Matt--
MATT: Away from it then?

00:12:09.297 --> 00:12:10.546
You just noticed it and pointed it out.

00:12:10.547 --> 00:12:12.636
TALIESIN: Okay, then I haven't
gotten fucking anywhere yet.

00:12:12.637 --> 00:12:14.176
MATT: So we can get to that when we can.

00:12:14.177 --> 00:12:15.236
LIAM: Just out of curiosity.

00:12:15.237 --> 00:12:16.606
MATT: Yes.
LIAM: The halls we're in,

00:12:16.607 --> 00:12:19.186
is it stone or is it metal?

00:12:19.187 --> 00:12:21.006
MATT: Best that you can tell,

00:12:21.007 --> 00:12:23.396
it seems to be mostly
metallic on the sides.

00:12:23.397 --> 00:12:25.376
The floor seems to be made of stone.

00:12:25.377 --> 00:12:26.977
The ceiling appears to be metal,

00:12:28.197 --> 00:12:30.846
metal plates, some of
which are fallen and bent.

00:12:30.847 --> 00:12:33.286
Like a duct.
TRAVIS: Weird.

00:12:33.287 --> 00:12:35.346
MATT: Well, I need you all
to roll initiative.

00:12:35.347 --> 00:12:37.818
(yelling)
LAURA: That fast, that fast,

00:12:37.819 --> 00:12:39.069
that fast.
SAM: This combat brought

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:41.279
to you by Dwarven Forge, by the way.

00:12:42.547 --> 00:12:43.926
If you want to become a
master of battle maps

00:12:43.927 --> 00:12:45.666
like Matt Mercer, the best place
to cut your teeth

00:12:45.667 --> 00:12:47.791
is Dwarven Forge's starter sets,
which you can find

00:12:47.792 --> 00:12:50.319
at bit.ly/critroledf.
MATT: 25 to 20?

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:51.153
TALIESIN: 22.

00:12:51.154 --> 00:12:54.936
LAURA: 22, clerics first?!
TALIESIN: Whoa, clerics first?!

00:12:54.937 --> 00:12:57.646
SAM: 25 over here.
LAURA: Oh!

00:12:57.647 --> 00:13:00.996
SAM: Natural 20. Oh wait, does
that mean magic happens? No.

00:13:00.997 --> 00:13:02.636
MATT: Not for initiative.

00:13:02.637 --> 00:13:04.677
LAURA: What's your dexterity, Caduceus?

00:13:05.587 --> 00:13:06.787
TALIESIN: 14.

00:13:08.387 --> 00:13:09.426
LAURA: Okay.

00:13:09.427 --> 00:13:12.209
TRAVIS: Who's at the--?
SAM: (vocalizes)

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:13.276
LAURA: I have a higher dex than him.

00:13:13.277 --> 00:13:15.527
MATT: All right, so
Jester's going first.

00:13:15.528 --> 00:13:17.332
Got to write that down, all right.

00:13:18.287 --> 00:13:20.762
SAM: The trumpet is crazy.

00:13:20.763 --> 00:13:22.722
MATT: Isn't it?
SAM: Yeah, it's cool.

00:13:22.723 --> 00:13:25.146
MATT: All righty, 20 to 15?

00:13:25.147 --> 00:13:27.443
MARISHA: 18!
MATT: All righty.

00:13:27.444 --> 00:13:28.735
ASHLEY: It's like experimental jazz.

00:13:28.736 --> 00:13:30.235
MARISHA: Yeah.
LIAM: I like it.

00:13:30.236 --> 00:13:31.796
MATT: 15 to 10?
MARISHA: Like battle music.

00:13:31.797 --> 00:13:33.516
LIAM: 13.
TRAVIS: 10.

00:13:33.517 --> 00:13:34.350
MATT: All right.

00:13:34.351 --> 00:13:35.396
LAURA: What, that 13, 10?
SAM: There's the thing,

00:13:35.397 --> 00:13:38.625
man, there's no time signature.
No meter at all.

00:13:38.626 --> 00:13:40.944
ASHLEY: (snapping)
(laughter)

00:13:40.945 --> 00:13:42.076
MATT: Yasha?

00:13:42.077 --> 00:13:43.812
ASHLEY: Eight.
MATT: All righty.

00:13:43.813 --> 00:13:45.998
ASHLEY: That's with advantage.

00:13:45.999 --> 00:13:47.540
TRAVIS: Is it really?!
ASHLEY: Off to a great start.

00:13:47.541 --> 00:13:49.556
MATT: Oh, well, hopefully
it's the last of

00:13:49.557 --> 00:13:50.477
of the bad rolls.
ASHLEY: My initiative is always

00:13:50.478 --> 00:13:51.502
blah.
MATT: I know!

00:13:51.503 --> 00:13:52.677
Like, for both campaigns.

00:13:52.678 --> 00:13:53.511
ASHLEY: You know--

00:13:53.512 --> 00:13:56.098
LIAM: It's history of the show.

00:13:56.099 --> 00:13:58.636
TALIESIN: It's canon.
MATT: Well, Veth, you're top.

00:13:58.637 --> 00:14:01.326
As the creature (impact, growling)

00:14:01.327 --> 00:14:04.316
you see its thick,
viscous saliva slopping

00:14:04.317 --> 00:14:05.546
onto the ground and then freezing

00:14:05.547 --> 00:14:08.896
in crystalline structures as it hits.

00:14:08.897 --> 00:14:11.036
Its breath causing mist.

00:14:11.037 --> 00:14:13.507
SAM: I don't know if it can
take a swipe at me, but

00:14:14.947 --> 00:14:17.090
I will--
TRAVIS: One way to find out.

00:14:18.097 --> 00:14:20.226
SAM: I will bonus action disengage.

00:14:20.227 --> 00:14:21.826
MATT: All righty.

00:14:21.827 --> 00:14:23.324
SAM: And run away from it.

00:14:23.325 --> 00:14:24.890
MATT: Whereabouts are you running?

00:14:26.047 --> 00:14:28.448
SAM: Like 30 feet forward.

00:14:28.449 --> 00:14:29.376
MATT: All right.

00:14:30.727 --> 00:14:32.176
About there?
SAM: I still have

00:14:32.177 --> 00:14:34.156
a good shot at it?

00:14:34.157 --> 00:14:37.546
MATT: Yeah, as long as Beauregard
ducks, which she can do.

00:14:37.547 --> 00:14:40.521
SAM: And I will hold my action

00:14:40.522 --> 00:14:42.912
until someone engages it

00:14:42.913 --> 00:14:45.776
and one of my friends
goes into me<i>lee</i>.

00:14:45.777 --> 00:14:47.101
MATT: You got it.

00:14:47.102 --> 00:14:49.616
(laughter)
ASHLEY: M'lee.

00:14:49.617 --> 00:14:51.306
MATT: All right, finishing Veth's turn,

00:14:51.307 --> 00:14:54.240
we have Jester's up next
with Caduceus on deck.

00:14:55.497 --> 00:14:57.346
LAURA: Oh god, that's that fast.

00:14:57.347 --> 00:14:59.579
I don't want to be up early, no.
MATT: Yeah, you rolled a high initative.

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:01.440
SAM: It's 7:01pm, here we go.

00:15:01.441 --> 00:15:03.309
(laughter)

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:05.475
LAURA: You know what
would be a cool feature

00:15:05.476 --> 00:15:07.550
on D&amp;D Beyond is if you
could separate your spells

00:15:07.551 --> 00:15:10.087
into regular spells and
bonus action spells.

00:15:10.088 --> 00:15:10.957
ALL: You can.

00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:12.089
LAURA: Oh, you can? How?

00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:14.486
(laughter)

00:15:14.487 --> 00:15:17.714
MATT: This commercial for
D&amp;D Beyond brought to you by--

00:15:17.715 --> 00:15:18.548
LAURA: How?

00:15:18.549 --> 00:15:19.636
TALIESIN and LIAM: Go
into your actions--

00:15:19.637 --> 00:15:21.564
LIAM: -- in the upper left-hand
corner of that big box.

00:15:21.565 --> 00:15:22.726
LAURA: Oh, bonus actions?
SAM: Then bonus actions.

00:15:22.727 --> 00:15:25.436
LIAM: The tops are actions
then you scroll further down

00:15:25.437 --> 00:15:27.076
and it lists your bonus actions.

00:15:27.077 --> 00:15:29.236
LAURA: Oh, I have one
bonus action spell?

00:15:29.237 --> 00:15:32.466
Wow, go me, okay, okay.

00:15:32.467 --> 00:15:33.766
LIAM: That's one more than I have.

00:15:33.767 --> 00:15:37.726
LAURA: I'm going to Invoke Duplicity!

00:15:37.727 --> 00:15:39.856
MATT: All righty!
LAURA: I'm going to invoke

00:15:39.857 --> 00:15:42.625
my duplicate directly behind Randall!

00:15:42.626 --> 00:15:44.414
LIAM: The spells further down.
MARISHA and TRAVIS: (laugh)

00:15:44.415 --> 00:15:45.248
MATT: Behind--?

00:15:45.249 --> 00:15:46.606
LAURA: The monster.
MATT: Oh, the monster.

00:15:47.529 --> 00:15:49.916
SAM: Wait, [inaudible] reaction one?

00:15:49.917 --> 00:15:51.856
LIAM: It's listed under reactions.
LAURA: And--

00:15:51.857 --> 00:15:53.166
LIAM: So I have no bonus actions.

00:15:53.167 --> 00:15:55.782
LAURA: She's going to be
like (tongue waggling)

00:15:55.783 --> 00:15:56.896
because she can.

00:15:56.897 --> 00:15:57.730
MATT: All right.

00:15:57.731 --> 00:15:59.544
LAURA: She's going to
make a lot of noise.

00:15:59.545 --> 00:16:00.378
MATT: Okay.

00:16:00.379 --> 00:16:01.796
LAURA: To hopefully distract
them a little bit.

00:16:01.797 --> 00:16:03.800
And then for my bonus action,

00:16:05.487 --> 00:16:07.812
I'm going to cast

00:16:09.187 --> 00:16:10.969
Spiritual Weapon.

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:13.556
MATT: All righty.
LAURA: Right on top of him.

00:16:13.557 --> 00:16:15.026
MATT: All right, towards
the front, the side?

00:16:15.027 --> 00:16:16.077
Where do you want it?

00:16:16.927 --> 00:16:18.436
LAURA: Yes, right there.

00:16:18.437 --> 00:16:20.339
MATT: Right there, you got it.

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:22.236
LAURA: And I'm going to try to hit him.

00:16:22.237 --> 00:16:24.096
LIAM: Looks like he
just wants to hug you.

00:16:24.097 --> 00:16:25.129
LAURA: 29.

00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:27.047
MATT: That definitely hits.
TRAVIS: Beau.

00:16:28.577 --> 00:16:29.736
TALIESIN: We should save the big ones--

00:16:29.737 --> 00:16:33.411
LAURA: Nine points of
spiritual unicorn--

00:16:33.412 --> 00:16:35.552
no, lollipop damage.

00:16:35.553 --> 00:16:37.897
This just a little cute
lollipop, this is not

00:16:37.898 --> 00:16:40.006
the high level lollipop.
MATT: You got it, all righty.

00:16:40.007 --> 00:16:42.516
So as it appears (whooshing)
sheers itself down.

00:16:42.517 --> 00:16:44.086
It strikes the sides of its hide.

00:16:44.087 --> 00:16:46.776
You see it cuts through, a minor wound,

00:16:46.777 --> 00:16:50.036
but nevertheless, it shows some damage.

00:16:50.037 --> 00:16:52.456
It seems less interested in the noise

00:16:52.457 --> 00:16:55.306
of your duplicate at the moment

00:16:55.307 --> 00:16:57.696
as it's now focused on the group

00:16:57.697 --> 00:16:58.936
of individuals to its front,

00:16:58.937 --> 00:17:01.106
but we'll see what it
does in previous rounds.

00:17:01.107 --> 00:17:02.136
That finish your turn?

00:17:02.137 --> 00:17:04.656
Do you want to stay put,
or you going to move?

00:17:04.657 --> 00:17:06.772
LAURA: I don't know what's
around that corner,

00:17:06.773 --> 00:17:07.731
but I will try--

00:17:07.732 --> 00:17:10.516
Oh god, I'll maybe back up five feet.

00:17:10.517 --> 00:17:12.086
MATT: Five feet this way?
LAURA: Yeah.

00:17:12.087 --> 00:17:13.886
MATT: Okay, you are
backing up into this large

00:17:13.887 --> 00:17:15.916
broken board that catches your back

00:17:15.917 --> 00:17:17.206
as you back up into it.

00:17:17.207 --> 00:17:18.396
Is that where you want to be?

00:17:18.397 --> 00:17:20.062
LAURA: Sure.
MATT: Okay.

00:17:20.063 --> 00:17:20.963
That finishes your go.

00:17:20.964 --> 00:17:22.446
Caduceus, you're up.

00:17:22.447 --> 00:17:26.426
TALIESIN: I'm going to
cast Bless at 2nd-level.

00:17:26.427 --> 00:17:27.906
I'm going to throw it at you.

00:17:27.907 --> 00:17:28.740
MARISHA: Hell yeah.

00:17:28.741 --> 00:17:33.496
TALIESIN: Myself, you, and you, Sam.

00:17:33.497 --> 00:17:34.951
So that's that as well.
SAM: Oh, thank you.

00:17:34.952 --> 00:17:36.775
ASHLEY: I'll take it.

00:17:36.776 --> 00:17:39.556
SAM: And it does what, again?

00:17:39.557 --> 00:17:41.586
TALIESIN: d4 to saves, d4 to attacks.

00:17:41.587 --> 00:17:42.420
SAM: Cool, thank you.

00:17:42.421 --> 00:17:43.896
MATT: Sorry, let's just do Veth's to--

00:17:43.897 --> 00:17:46.056
TALIESIN: Wow.
MARISHA: 500 hours later.

00:17:46.057 --> 00:17:47.296
TALIESIN: Literally my signature move.

00:17:47.297 --> 00:17:50.523
LIAM: Smash cut to the end of Campaign 3.

00:17:50.524 --> 00:17:53.052
"What do I have as a bonus action?"

00:17:53.053 --> 00:17:55.943
MARISHA: Wait, so Beau, Veth, and who?

00:17:55.944 --> 00:17:57.259
TALIESIN: Yasha and myself.

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:58.446
MATT: So four people?

00:17:58.447 --> 00:18:01.436
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's level two,
so three plus one.

00:18:01.437 --> 00:18:03.056
MATT: You got it.

00:18:03.057 --> 00:18:06.376
TALIESIN: One for me so that I
don't lose it by getting hit.

00:18:06.377 --> 00:18:09.086
MATT: You got it, okay.

00:18:09.087 --> 00:18:14.063
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and--
Well, where am I going to do?

00:18:14.989 --> 00:18:19.136
I'm going to try and
back up around the corner.

00:18:19.137 --> 00:18:21.446
Do I see anything around the corner?

00:18:21.447 --> 00:18:22.280
MATT: If you want to go

00:18:22.281 --> 00:18:23.870
back around the corner
here, you'll know.

00:18:23.871 --> 00:18:25.566
TALIESIN: Yeah, let's take a look.

00:18:25.567 --> 00:18:26.726
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: That far.

00:18:26.727 --> 00:18:28.336
MATT: That far? You got it.

00:18:28.337 --> 00:18:31.076
As you glance in, it is collapsed

00:18:31.077 --> 00:18:33.874
and there is nowhere to go on that side.

00:18:33.875 --> 00:18:36.619
It is a enclosed pathway.

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:37.462
TALIESIN: Okay.
LAURA: That would have been

00:18:37.463 --> 00:18:38.893
a good place to be.

00:18:40.503 --> 00:18:45.080
TALIESIN: I will stay there
for the moment, then.

00:18:46.057 --> 00:18:47.287
MATT: Okay.

00:18:47.288 --> 00:18:48.121
TALIESIN: As long as it doesn't, yeah,

00:18:48.122 --> 00:18:49.626
as long as it's clear.

00:18:49.627 --> 00:18:51.386
MATT: All right, that
finishes your turn.

00:18:51.387 --> 00:18:53.047
The creature now goes.

00:18:53.048 --> 00:18:55.166
MARISHA: Aw.

00:18:55.167 --> 00:18:56.598
MATT: It rolled a natural 20
for initiative.

00:18:56.599 --> 00:18:58.158
(groaning)
TALIESIN: Wow, love it.

00:18:58.159 --> 00:18:59.286
MARISHA: No, I hate it.

00:18:59.287 --> 00:19:00.244
MATT: It's there on the ground.

00:19:00.245 --> 00:19:03.866
You can see now it has
six legs out of its body.

00:19:03.867 --> 00:19:05.966
These heavy, muscular,

00:19:05.967 --> 00:19:08.266
shorter, lizard-like limbs

00:19:08.267 --> 00:19:10.356
that are shorter, perspective-wise,

00:19:10.357 --> 00:19:11.596
but this is a massive beast.

00:19:11.597 --> 00:19:13.894
They are close to six to
eight feet long each.

00:19:13.895 --> 00:19:15.208
As it (growling).

00:19:15.209 --> 00:19:16.416
SAM: They're all left legs, though.

00:19:16.417 --> 00:19:17.910
MATT: Yeah, all of them.

00:19:17.911 --> 00:19:19.415
It runs in circles, it's weird.

00:19:20.727 --> 00:19:23.051
As it sees the scattering,
people beginning to back up

00:19:23.052 --> 00:19:24.686
and then people start
drifting off to the side,

00:19:24.687 --> 00:19:26.164
and Caduceus ducks around the corner,

00:19:26.165 --> 00:19:29.316
it adjusts itself up against the wall

00:19:29.317 --> 00:19:30.986
over here a bit.
LAURA: Does it step away

00:19:30.987 --> 00:19:33.526
from my duplicate?
MATT: It does.

00:19:33.527 --> 00:19:35.676
LAURA: Do I get an opportunity
attack on that then?

00:19:35.677 --> 00:19:38.418
MATT: From the duplicate?
LAURA: Yeah.

00:19:38.419 --> 00:19:40.686
MATT: I don't know if the
duplicate gets opportunity attacks.

00:19:40.687 --> 00:19:42.426
It's not considered
a creature, I don't think.

00:19:42.427 --> 00:19:43.786
LAURA: I guess that makes sense.

00:19:43.787 --> 00:19:45.145
MATT: Unfortunately.

00:19:46.353 --> 00:19:47.186
TRAVIS: Do you know?

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:50.535
LAURA: No.
SAM: Of course not.

00:19:50.536 --> 00:19:52.288
MATT: It'll go there, I think.

00:19:52.289 --> 00:19:54.706
As it backs up and clings to the wall,

00:19:54.707 --> 00:19:56.296
you see three of its legs dig

00:19:56.297 --> 00:19:57.316
into the sides of the metal.

00:19:57.317 --> 00:19:59.586
You hear (creaking metal)
creak into his grip

00:19:59.587 --> 00:20:01.333
as it holds it, the other
three holding it there.

00:20:01.334 --> 00:20:03.658
And it backs its head into its chest.

00:20:03.659 --> 00:20:04.492
SAM: Oh no.

00:20:04.493 --> 00:20:06.534
MATT: As it begins to inhale, you see

00:20:06.535 --> 00:20:08.406
crystals of ice begin to appear

00:20:08.407 --> 00:20:11.516
around the corners of its toothy maw.

00:20:11.517 --> 00:20:13.551
And as it suddenly--
LAURA: Take a shot.

00:20:13.552 --> 00:20:15.317
MATT: -- comes in with a pause and then

00:20:15.318 --> 00:20:16.767
(exhales)

00:20:16.768 --> 00:20:19.666
extends this blast of
bright white energy.

00:20:19.667 --> 00:20:22.146
As it coasts outward,

00:20:22.147 --> 00:20:25.370
it's an absolute-zero
flash freeze in a cone.

00:20:26.417 --> 00:20:27.480
SAM: A cone?

00:20:28.457 --> 00:20:29.764
But I ran away!

00:20:29.765 --> 00:20:31.766
LIAM: Soft serve, or--?

00:20:31.767 --> 00:20:33.246
MATT: Well, Essek made it out of it.

00:20:33.247 --> 00:20:35.566
MARISHA: Chocolate dipped?

00:20:35.567 --> 00:20:37.359
TALIESIN: Do I get partial cover or no?
MARISHA: Waffle?

00:20:38.227 --> 00:20:39.060
MATT: I will--

00:20:39.061 --> 00:20:41.076
TALIESIN: I was trying to
specifically get cover there.

00:20:41.077 --> 00:20:42.069
MATT: Yes, you do, so you will get a bonus

00:20:42.069 --> 00:20:43.057
to your saving throw.

00:20:43.057 --> 00:20:43.890
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:20:43.891 --> 00:20:46.680
MATT: So I need everybody

00:20:46.681 --> 00:20:50.430
to make a constitution saving throw.

00:20:50.431 --> 00:20:52.266
SAM: Dexterity?
MARISHA: It's not dex?

00:20:52.267 --> 00:20:53.482
MATT: It's not dex. It's constitution,

00:20:53.483 --> 00:20:55.116
so you do not get a bonus.
LIAM: That's cold.

00:20:55.117 --> 00:20:56.169
MATT: It's only to dex.
LAURA: Do I get advantage

00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:57.936
because I'm cold resistant?

00:20:57.937 --> 00:20:59.236
MARISHA: Ooh, yes, yes, yes.
MATT: No, you take half damage

00:20:59.237 --> 00:21:00.706
because of cold resistant.

00:21:00.707 --> 00:21:01.887
LAURA: Shit!
TALIESIN: You get a d4 on that.

00:21:01.888 --> 00:21:02.804
LAURA: Shit!
MARISHA: Ooh, yes.

00:21:02.805 --> 00:21:04.188
ASHLEY: Oh no.
SAM: What's going on over there?

00:21:04.189 --> 00:21:07.539
MATT: Okay, hold on a second,
hold onto those numbers.

00:21:11.417 --> 00:21:12.382
LIAM: I rolled real low.

00:21:12.383 --> 00:21:15.215
LAURA: Really low.
LIAM: Real low.

00:21:15.216 --> 00:21:16.784
TALIESIN: Added the d4? Added the d4?

00:21:16.785 --> 00:21:19.151
SAM: Oh, I didn't. Totally forgot.

00:21:19.152 --> 00:21:20.330
You just said it two seconds ago.

00:21:20.331 --> 00:21:21.976
TALIESIN: All three of
you got a d4 on it.

00:21:21.977 --> 00:21:23.947
MATT: Fjord, what'd you get?
TRAVIS: 15.

00:21:23.948 --> 00:21:25.651
MATT: 49 points of cold damage.

00:21:25.652 --> 00:21:26.659
MARISHA: 49?!

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:28.228
MATT: Yes.

00:21:28.229 --> 00:21:29.062
Jester?

00:21:29.063 --> 00:21:30.477
LAURA: Seven.

00:21:30.478 --> 00:21:33.536
MATT: 49 halved, so you take
24 points of cold damage

00:21:33.537 --> 00:21:35.046
and I need you to make a constitution--

00:21:35.047 --> 00:21:37.066
Oh no, you don't--
yeah, constitution check

00:21:37.067 --> 00:21:38.646
for your duplicate.

00:21:38.647 --> 00:21:39.676
LAURA: Oh, okay.

00:21:39.677 --> 00:21:41.297
LIAM: Nine.
LAURA: I get advantage because War Caster.

00:21:41.298 --> 00:21:42.831
MATT: 49 points of cold damage.

00:21:45.377 --> 00:21:47.516
TRAVIS: Shit, fuck.
LAURA: What do I add to it?

00:21:47.517 --> 00:21:49.286
My wisdom?
MATT: It's your constitution saving throw.

00:21:49.287 --> 00:21:50.398
LAURA: My constitution saving throw

00:21:50.399 --> 00:21:51.232
on this?
MATT: Correct.

00:21:51.233 --> 00:21:53.963
LAURA: 21.
MATT: 21? Not enough.

00:21:53.964 --> 00:21:55.822
LAURA: But I took half damage on the 40--?

00:21:55.823 --> 00:21:56.747
MATT: That's right, no, no.

00:21:56.748 --> 00:21:59.196
You took a half damage
and the damage you took--

00:21:59.197 --> 00:22:00.926
No, you're right, so it
would save, you're right.

00:22:00.927 --> 00:22:02.223
Yeah, it's half to half.
MARISHA: We don't have time for this asshole.

00:22:02.224 --> 00:22:03.575
SAM: Already?
MATT: All right, Veth?

00:22:03.576 --> 00:22:05.199
LIAM: I was still injured from the first fight.
SAM: 22.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.324
MATT: 22, all right. So you take half,

00:22:06.325 --> 00:22:08.013
you take 24 points of cold damage.

00:22:08.014 --> 00:22:09.299
SAM: Oh, and because it's an--

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:10.724
MARISHA: We're really busy, okay?
SAM: -- evade?

00:22:10.725 --> 00:22:12.592
Do I evade? No, dexterity.
MATT: That's dexterity--

00:22:12.593 --> 00:22:13.819
SAM: No, never mind.
MATT: So you just take it.

00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:15.041
LIAM: I asked for a short rest.
MATT: Yasha?

00:22:15.042 --> 00:22:16.541
LIAM: But no one wanted a short rest.
ASHLEY: 27.

00:22:16.542 --> 00:22:18.457
MATT: 27, so you take 24 points

00:22:18.458 --> 00:22:20.088
cold damage. Caduceus?

00:22:20.089 --> 00:22:21.180
TALIESIN: 19.

00:22:21.181 --> 00:22:22.014
MATT: 19, you take

00:22:22.015 --> 00:22:23.096
24 points of cold damage.
LIAM: I was injured

00:22:23.097 --> 00:22:24.379
from before this fight already, so.

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:25.770
MARISHA: 30 total.
LIAM: Single digits.

00:22:25.771 --> 00:22:26.607
MATT: 30 total?

00:22:26.608 --> 00:22:28.240
24 points of cold damage.

00:22:30.157 --> 00:22:31.446
ASHLEY: Brr!
LAURA: Woof.

00:22:31.447 --> 00:22:33.536
MATT: And with that,
it's going to go ahead

00:22:33.537 --> 00:22:37.896
and skitter up the wall and
begin to climb up its space.

00:22:37.897 --> 00:22:42.871
It is now upside down and over

00:22:42.872 --> 00:22:44.176
all of you right here.

00:22:44.177 --> 00:22:45.496
LIAM: Oh, that's not nice.
TALIESIN: Does anybody

00:22:45.497 --> 00:22:47.376
get an opportunity attack
from it moving that way?

00:22:47.377 --> 00:22:49.296
MATT: Nope, because the
ceiling up here takes it

00:22:49.297 --> 00:22:50.606
out of your five-foot range.

00:22:50.607 --> 00:22:52.336
It's about-- well, at its size?

00:22:52.337 --> 00:22:53.761
TALIESIN: Well, I mean,
it moved past Fjord,

00:22:53.762 --> 00:22:55.616
that was all I was--

00:22:55.617 --> 00:22:57.312
MATT: It wasn't quite
in melee with Fjord.

00:22:57.313 --> 00:22:59.136
MARISHA: Matt, did we
get an opportunity to

00:22:59.137 --> 00:23:00.169
finish our short rest,

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:02.356
or did this guy burst
into our short rest?

00:23:02.357 --> 00:23:03.606
MATT: This guy would have
burst into your short rest.

00:23:03.607 --> 00:23:05.620
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Okay.
LAURA: He did?

00:23:07.256 --> 00:23:08.701
TRAVIS: Yep.
SAM: Then you're dead.

00:23:08.702 --> 00:23:12.866
LAURA: I had already
marked off all my healing.

00:23:12.867 --> 00:23:15.316
Oh wait, no. We weren't
taking a short rest.

00:23:15.317 --> 00:23:17.006
We were only doing the ritual.

00:23:17.007 --> 00:23:18.522
MATT: That's right,
short rest you did before.

00:23:18.523 --> 00:23:19.359
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:20.926
MATT: Yeah.
MARISHA: So we're good?

00:23:20.927 --> 00:23:22.616
MATT: Yeah, you would have
taken your short rest before.

00:23:22.617 --> 00:23:24.503
This is just you doing
your stopping to Commune.

00:23:24.504 --> 00:23:26.446
You guys got that short rest
in the previous chamber.

00:23:26.447 --> 00:23:27.280
So you're fine.
TRAVIS: Communion?

00:23:27.281 --> 00:23:29.447
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay.
MATT: That is correct.

00:23:31.137 --> 00:23:35.486
So, I would say, yeah, it is not

00:23:35.487 --> 00:23:36.796
because it is a huge creature.

00:23:36.797 --> 00:23:37.816
It fills a lot of this chamber,

00:23:37.817 --> 00:23:38.727
even though it's up in the ceiling.

00:23:38.728 --> 00:23:42.686
So it's in, technically,
melee with everybody in that space

00:23:42.687 --> 00:23:44.726
in the center, but it did not
leave anybody's range.

00:23:44.727 --> 00:23:45.946
SAM: May I fire?

00:23:45.947 --> 00:23:48.043
MATT: You may.
SAM: Okay.

00:23:49.807 --> 00:23:50.956
Fuck.

00:23:50.957 --> 00:23:54.025
TALIESIN: Add a d4.
SAM: Oh, add a d4!

00:23:54.026 --> 00:23:56.322
SAM: One? Okay.
TALIESIN: Take it.

00:23:56.323 --> 00:23:59.036
SAM: 15.
MATT: 15, you fire

00:23:59.037 --> 00:24:00.846
and it actually hits
the side of its shoulder

00:24:00.847 --> 00:24:02.516
and just shears off into the stone.

00:24:02.517 --> 00:24:04.879
Its hide too hard and
the bolt goes wide.

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.547
SAM: I'm just too cold.

00:24:07.997 --> 00:24:10.106
MATT: All righty, that finishes its go.

00:24:10.107 --> 00:24:11.586
It is now Essek's turn.

00:24:11.587 --> 00:24:12.728
MARISHA: Oh!
LAURA: Yeah!

00:24:12.729 --> 00:24:14.729
MATT: Essek is extremely
unhappy about this.

00:24:16.247 --> 00:24:17.572
He is going to--

00:24:19.541 --> 00:24:23.672
SAM: Bum bum bum bum-ba-bum bum.

00:24:25.904 --> 00:24:28.586
♪ We are fighting in the hallway ♪

00:24:28.587 --> 00:24:30.740
MATT: Sorry, I should have
prepped for this beforehand.

00:24:33.927 --> 00:24:37.236
All right, he is going to
cast Magnify Gravity.

00:24:37.237 --> 00:24:39.560
SAM: Ooh, that's dunamancy shit.

00:24:40.517 --> 00:24:41.876
TALIESIN: Doing the 'mancy.
MATT: He's going to go ahead

00:24:41.877 --> 00:24:44.130
and look up and seeing
everyone get frozen goes,

00:24:44.131 --> 00:24:45.776
"This is not good." Puts his hand up,

00:24:45.777 --> 00:24:48.986
and as he closes his fist,
angrily clutching it

00:24:48.987 --> 00:24:51.466
in front of him,
you watch as the space just

00:24:51.467 --> 00:24:55.446
below the creature suddenly
creates this black sphere

00:24:55.447 --> 00:24:57.416
that engulfs part of
its head and shoulders.

00:24:57.417 --> 00:25:00.956
And as it does, you watch the
metal that it's holding on to

00:25:00.957 --> 00:25:04.566
begin to creak as it's
trying to pull it down

00:25:04.567 --> 00:25:06.496
probably onto some of you,
but getting it off

00:25:06.497 --> 00:25:08.147
of the ceiling, at the very least.

00:25:09.237 --> 00:25:10.356
So with that, the creature has

00:25:10.357 --> 00:25:12.946
to make a constitution saving throw.

00:25:12.947 --> 00:25:15.430
With a natural three, it does not succeed.

00:25:18.897 --> 00:25:21.897
SAM: Incoming monster.
LAURA: Uh-huh, uh-huh.

00:25:23.687 --> 00:25:27.016
MATT: Okay, it takes 19 points

00:25:27.017 --> 00:25:29.597
of force damage.
SAM: Okay, good.

00:25:31.227 --> 00:25:35.326
MATT: And its speed is
halved on its next turn.

00:25:35.327 --> 00:25:37.386
As it's currently unable to pull away.

00:25:37.387 --> 00:25:39.100
It's holding it in place.

00:25:40.587 --> 00:25:45.216
So Essek's, now they're locked
in place, going, "Take it down."

00:25:45.217 --> 00:25:46.236
And he's clutching it there.

00:25:46.237 --> 00:25:48.016
That finishes, and Essek
is going to go ahead

00:25:48.017 --> 00:25:52.266
and back up away from
here, finishing his go.

00:25:52.267 --> 00:25:53.716
Beau, you're up.
Caleb, you're on deck.

00:25:53.717 --> 00:25:58.296
MARISHA: Okay, I'm
going to do a wall run.

00:25:58.297 --> 00:25:59.893
I'm going to run up
the side of the wall,

00:25:59.894 --> 00:26:00.727
I'm going to back flip,

00:26:00.728 --> 00:26:02.916
I'm going to do a
two aerial kick-kick

00:26:02.917 --> 00:26:06.086
as I flip backwards.
SAM: Yes, yes.

00:26:06.087 --> 00:26:08.446
MARISHA: That's real good.
That's real good.

00:26:08.447 --> 00:26:12.036
That's a natural 19 on
the first one for 21,

00:26:12.037 --> 00:26:14.153
or sorry, 31.
MATT: That definitely hits, yeah.

00:26:14.154 --> 00:26:18.678
MARISHA: And then the second one is a 13,

00:26:18.679 --> 00:26:20.278
20, 25 total.

00:26:20.279 --> 00:26:23.340
MATT: Both hit. Go ahead and roll damage.

00:26:24.387 --> 00:26:25.410
MARISHA: Plus 14.

00:26:28.192 --> 00:26:32.623
Okay, 14, 18 plus seven is--

00:26:34.152 --> 00:26:34.985
what is that?

00:26:34.986 --> 00:26:39.985
26 total?

00:26:40.097 --> 00:26:40.947
MATT: 26 for both of them?

00:26:40.948 --> 00:26:42.137
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: You got it.

00:26:43.937 --> 00:26:46.891
Jump off the wall, crack, crack,
hitting the side of it,

00:26:46.892 --> 00:26:48.326
but it still holds itself firm.

00:26:48.327 --> 00:26:49.852
The gravity clutching it in place.

00:26:49.853 --> 00:26:51.680
And it's like (monster groans)

00:26:51.681 --> 00:26:53.506
MARISHA: And then we'll
go ahead and Flurry of Blows.

00:26:53.507 --> 00:26:55.156
MATT: Go for it.

00:26:55.157 --> 00:26:57.426
This is full on two foot combo here.

00:26:57.427 --> 00:27:00.800
MARISHA: Just, you know,
just feeling it.

00:27:03.517 --> 00:27:06.230
A-pop pop, that was another natural 19.

00:27:06.231 --> 00:27:07.272
TRAVIS: "A-pop pop."

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:10.905
MARISHA: So 31 and

00:27:13.361 --> 00:27:15.944
29 to hit.
MATT: Okay, both hit.

00:27:17.387 --> 00:27:20.675
SAM: Oh jesus.
MARISHA: (groans)

00:27:22.097 --> 00:27:26.156
Okay, so 13 damage for one

00:27:26.157 --> 00:27:29.126
and then 15 damage for the other.

00:27:29.127 --> 00:27:30.426
Rolled really good on all those.

00:27:30.427 --> 00:27:31.951
MATT: Nice, all right.

00:27:31.952 --> 00:27:33.506
MARISHA: And extract those aspects.

00:27:33.507 --> 00:27:37.746
MATT: Okay, you notice the creature

00:27:37.747 --> 00:27:39.868
as you're impacting its
body and land you can feel

00:27:39.869 --> 00:27:41.356
the energy that you expanded into

00:27:41.357 --> 00:27:42.557
and pulled back from it.

00:27:43.497 --> 00:27:46.746
Surprisingly to no one,
it is immune to cold,

00:27:46.747 --> 00:27:48.679
but it is vulnerable to fire.

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:49.959
SAM and TALIESIN: Vulnerable?

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:52.745
SAM: Vulnerable!
LAURA: Not bad.

00:27:52.746 --> 00:27:54.463
MARISHA: So I'm just going to
shout to the group:

00:27:54.464 --> 00:27:56.574
Hit it with fire! Caleb.

00:27:58.487 --> 00:27:59.956
SAM: Wow.

00:27:59.957 --> 00:28:02.667
MATT: All right, does that finish your turn?
TRAVIS: ♪ Don't think you have to ask him twice. ♪

00:28:02.668 --> 00:28:04.375
MATT: (laughs)

00:28:04.376 --> 00:28:05.538
MARISHA: Um.

00:28:05.539 --> 00:28:07.179
MATT: Do you want to move or stay put?

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:08.436
MARISHA: I will-- can I just,

00:28:08.437 --> 00:28:10.386
if it looks like he's going to crash,

00:28:10.387 --> 00:28:13.716
I just want to back up maybe five feet

00:28:13.717 --> 00:28:16.316
to not be directly under him.

00:28:16.317 --> 00:28:18.111
Yeah, that's fine.

00:28:18.112 --> 00:28:19.486
MATT: All right, you got it.

00:28:19.487 --> 00:28:20.886
All right, that finishes Beau's go.

00:28:20.887 --> 00:28:21.720
Caleb, you're up.

00:28:21.721 --> 00:28:24.506
LIAM: So Caleb is
completely crusted over,

00:28:24.507 --> 00:28:27.436
hypothermia, can barely move.

00:28:27.437 --> 00:28:32.437
Pulls out a cocoon in one hand

00:28:32.677 --> 00:28:35.368
and a string in the other

00:28:35.369 --> 00:28:37.376
and just waivers in place.

00:28:37.377 --> 00:28:38.856
It's on the ground now, right?

00:28:38.857 --> 00:28:41.336
MATT: No, it's still up
there, but it's being slowed

00:28:41.337 --> 00:28:42.257
by the Magnify Gravity.

00:28:42.258 --> 00:28:44.135
LIAM: It's up top?
MATT: Yeah.

00:28:44.997 --> 00:28:48.016
LIAM: Shoves the string away
and squeezes the cocoon,

00:28:48.017 --> 00:28:49.956
and you watch as his
shoulders broaden out

00:28:49.957 --> 00:28:53.586
and he grows and grows almost
as high as the hallway is.

00:28:53.587 --> 00:28:55.946
And there's a gigantic ape
in the hallway now.

00:28:55.947 --> 00:28:56.800
MATT: Oh, damn.

00:28:57.637 --> 00:28:59.773
SAM: Great ape.
LIAM: I had seven hit points.

00:28:59.774 --> 00:29:00.652
TRAVIS: Great ape.

00:29:01.857 --> 00:29:03.726
LAURA: Yeah, probably smart.

00:29:03.727 --> 00:29:07.977
SAM: Oh yes! Kong.
LAURA: Wow!

00:29:07.978 --> 00:29:10.006
MATT: Yeah.
LAURA: Kaiju battle!

00:29:10.007 --> 00:29:13.696
MATT: You are now
face to face with its toes.

00:29:13.697 --> 00:29:15.496
You're both yin-yanged in the middle

00:29:15.497 --> 00:29:17.576
of this chamber and you are
almost as tall as the ceiling.

00:29:17.577 --> 00:29:19.126
You're almost pressed against it.

00:29:19.127 --> 00:29:21.108
MARISHA: I had this black light poster.

00:29:21.109 --> 00:29:23.143
(laughter)

00:29:23.144 --> 00:29:24.287
MATT: All righty.

00:29:25.802 --> 00:29:27.066
LIAM: That's it, I'm not going to move.

00:29:27.067 --> 00:29:29.216
I'm going to stay right in his
face, and that was my action,

00:29:29.217 --> 00:29:30.296
so all done.
MATT: You got it.

00:29:30.297 --> 00:29:32.795
Great, so that finishes Caleb's go.

00:29:32.796 --> 00:29:34.358
Fjord, you're up.

00:29:34.359 --> 00:29:36.976
TRAVIS: I guess I'll hear
Beau call out, "Hit it with fire."

00:29:36.977 --> 00:29:39.995
and I will run up and take two swings

00:29:39.996 --> 00:29:41.706
with the Star Razor.

00:29:41.707 --> 00:29:43.096
MATT: All right.
TRAVIS: Now, can I get

00:29:43.097 --> 00:29:45.526
in a flanking position
with it with the gorilla

00:29:45.527 --> 00:29:48.496
on the other side for
advantage on my swings?

00:29:48.497 --> 00:29:51.336
MATT: It's tough right now.
You can get into melee with it,

00:29:51.337 --> 00:29:53.776
but you can't flank it
because it's on the ceiling.

00:29:53.777 --> 00:29:55.014
TRAVIS: Oh, right, yes.

00:29:55.015 --> 00:29:57.350
I mean, details, yes, two--

00:29:58.724 --> 00:30:00.906
MATT: You're striking up
like this to try to hit it.

00:30:00.907 --> 00:30:02.776
It's large enough that
even though the ceiling is

00:30:02.777 --> 00:30:06.003
about 15, 20 feet up there,
it's still within range.

00:30:06.004 --> 00:30:08.671
TRAVIS: Great! I will take two swings.

00:30:11.187 --> 00:30:12.337
First one is a

00:30:13.587 --> 00:30:15.416
29 to hit.
MATT: That hits.

00:30:15.417 --> 00:30:17.292
TRAVIS: Second one is a

00:30:21.037 --> 00:30:22.509
23 to hit.
MATT: Both hit.

00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:23.760
Go ahead and roll damage.

00:30:25.727 --> 00:30:26.670
TRAVIS: Fucking--

00:30:28.997 --> 00:30:30.537
Goddamn it.

00:30:30.538 --> 00:30:31.786
LAURA: What?
TRAVIS: I was going to use

00:30:31.787 --> 00:30:34.296
Searing Smite, but I have
to do it before I hit,

00:30:34.297 --> 00:30:35.776
whatever the fuck, who gives a shit.

00:30:35.777 --> 00:30:37.109
MATT: I'll let you do it,
if you want to do it. It's fine.

00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:38.575
TRAVIS: Yeah, I want
to use Searing Smite!

00:30:38.576 --> 00:30:40.266
(laughter)

00:30:40.267 --> 00:30:41.878
LAURA: You would since she called out.

00:30:41.879 --> 00:30:43.426
TRAVIS: But it's a bonus action.

00:30:43.427 --> 00:30:44.781
MARISHA: Yeah, we knew
what you were going for.

00:30:44.782 --> 00:30:47.305
TRAVIS: Fucking angled fuck.
MATT: It's fine, it's fine.

00:30:48.547 --> 00:30:49.916
ASHLEY: Always takes a
minute to get in the groove.

00:30:49.917 --> 00:30:51.356
MATT: Yeah, if it's in
your actions, it's fine.

00:30:51.357 --> 00:30:54.230
If it's the next person's turn then, yeah.

00:30:55.557 --> 00:30:59.683
TRAVIS: 14, 17-- 17 points of slashing damage.

00:30:59.684 --> 00:31:00.517
MATT: All right.

00:31:00.518 --> 00:31:05.245
TRAVIS: On the first one and
same thing, 17 again and

00:31:07.179 --> 00:31:12.179
Seven, 12.

00:31:14.577 --> 00:31:17.626
21 points of fire damage.

00:31:17.627 --> 00:31:20.186
MATT: 21 points of fire damage.

00:31:20.187 --> 00:31:23.646
That doubles to
42 points of fire damage.

00:31:23.647 --> 00:31:24.900
LAURA: That's awesome.

00:31:25.827 --> 00:31:28.783
TRAVIS: And he is on fire.
MATT: Okay!

00:31:28.784 --> 00:31:30.856
TRAVIS: At the start of
every one of his turns,

00:31:30.857 --> 00:31:34.506
if he doesn't take a
constitution save to put

00:31:34.507 --> 00:31:37.236
out the flames, they'll
take 1d6 fire damage.

00:31:37.237 --> 00:31:38.366
MATT: You got it.

00:31:38.367 --> 00:31:39.506
He is looking real rough.

00:31:39.507 --> 00:31:41.426
SAM: Ooh, already?
LAURA: Oh wow!

00:31:41.427 --> 00:31:42.844
MATT: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Fire.

00:31:42.845 --> 00:31:43.678
MARISHA: Good, fire.

00:31:43.679 --> 00:31:45.680
TRAVIS: Extract Aspects.

00:31:45.681 --> 00:31:47.286
MATT: All righty, that
finish your go, Fjord?

00:31:47.287 --> 00:31:49.306
TRAVIS: Yes.
MATT: Yasha, you're up.

00:31:49.307 --> 00:31:50.740
ASHLEY: Okay, so.

00:31:52.227 --> 00:31:56.230
Holy Avenger in my hands.
I will take some swipes.

00:31:57.157 --> 00:32:00.085
MATT: All righty, yeah,
you are within melee.

00:32:00.086 --> 00:32:02.396
ASHLEY: (growls)

00:32:02.397 --> 00:32:05.132
Okay, first did I? Don't, well,
hold on, hold on, hold on.

00:32:05.133 --> 00:32:06.148
TALIESIN: You'll add a d4 to that.
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.

00:32:06.149 --> 00:32:08.481
SAM: I love Ashley
after she takes a nap.

00:32:08.482 --> 00:32:10.349
ASHLEY: Oh, that's cocked.

00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:13.710
SAM: Just a little sillier.
(laughter)

00:32:17.167 --> 00:32:18.748
ASHLEY: 21?

00:32:18.749 --> 00:32:21.846
MATT: 21 hits.
ASHLEY: (exhales) Dang, okay, okay.

00:32:21.847 --> 00:32:23.764
Here we go, here we go.

00:32:26.567 --> 00:32:27.557
SAM: What are those things?
LAURA: Ooh!

00:32:27.557 --> 00:32:28.390
SAM: What just happened?

00:32:28.391 --> 00:32:29.730
ASHLEY: These are those little--

00:32:29.731 --> 00:32:30.961
LAURA: Oh, yeah, yeah.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:32:30.962 --> 00:32:32.263
SAM: Cool.
LAURA: Those are so cool.

00:32:32.264 --> 00:32:33.560
SAM: Shard dice.

00:32:35.708 --> 00:32:36.541
ASHLEY: Holy moly.

00:32:40.687 --> 00:32:42.786
Oh my god, my math is just so bad.

00:32:42.787 --> 00:32:45.536
Okay, okay, okay, that would be

00:32:45.537 --> 00:32:49.914
38 points of damage for the first hit.

00:32:49.915 --> 00:32:51.388
MATT: Okay, how do you want to do this?

00:32:51.389 --> 00:32:53.833
(cheering)
SAM: That was fast!

00:32:53.834 --> 00:32:54.779
ASHLEY: Okay!

00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:56.094
TRAVIS: That's usually not a good thing.

00:32:56.095 --> 00:32:56.961
TALIESIN: No.
ASHLEY: Yeah, I know.

00:32:56.962 --> 00:32:58.786
SAM: No, it was just an easy one.

00:32:58.787 --> 00:33:01.756
ASHLEY: All right,
so I'm going to stick the--

00:33:01.757 --> 00:33:03.620
since he's on the ceiling,

00:33:06.917 --> 00:33:10.326
I just want to somehow
get near his belly

00:33:10.327 --> 00:33:13.786
and just slice him all
the way down to the tail.

00:33:13.787 --> 00:33:15.816
MATT: Okay, well, the magnified gravity

00:33:15.817 --> 00:33:17.726
that Essek is currently holding on,

00:33:17.727 --> 00:33:20.636
you can see is drawing it
down off of its perch.

00:33:20.637 --> 00:33:22.636
And as it's holding onto the ceiling,

00:33:22.637 --> 00:33:25.166
trying to find a way to clamber away,

00:33:25.167 --> 00:33:27.146
itself extremely hurt and on fire

00:33:27.147 --> 00:33:31.203
and screeching at the sense
of the flames around it.

00:33:31.204 --> 00:33:34.376
The gravity pulls one half
of its legs off the ceiling,

00:33:34.377 --> 00:33:36.886
exposing its belly, and you
take that moment to just

00:33:36.887 --> 00:33:39.073
(slicing sound) right across,

00:33:39.074 --> 00:33:40.506
(wet thud) it's innards,

00:33:40.507 --> 00:33:44.728
this pale white colorless look
to its organs, just spill out

00:33:44.729 --> 00:33:47.086
and hit the ground and
immediately freeze over

00:33:47.087 --> 00:33:49.376
as they impact, the body (heavy impacts)

00:33:49.377 --> 00:33:50.297
onto the ground.

00:33:50.298 --> 00:33:52.190
SAM: Viscera.
MATT: Still in fire.

00:33:53.398 --> 00:33:54.958
Buh-bye.

00:33:54.959 --> 00:33:56.307
LAURA: Buh-buh-bye.

00:33:56.308 --> 00:33:58.098
TRAVIS: Buh-bye. (explosion)

00:33:58.099 --> 00:34:00.389
SAM: Super easy, guys.

00:34:00.390 --> 00:34:01.886
ASHLEY: Well yeah, that felt--

00:34:01.887 --> 00:34:03.858
TALIESIN: That was too easy.
ASHLEY: -- too easy?

00:34:03.859 --> 00:34:05.056
SAM: No, I missed.
MARISHA: There's got to

00:34:05.057 --> 00:34:06.490
be more of them or?

00:34:06.491 --> 00:34:07.887
MATT: All right, does that
finish your turn, Yasha?

00:34:07.888 --> 00:34:09.176
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think it's that one.

00:34:09.177 --> 00:34:12.446
MARISHA: Uh huh.
TRAVIS: Not just one cockroach.

00:34:12.447 --> 00:34:14.222
ASHLEY: Okay. Uh.

00:34:16.970 --> 00:34:18.206
ASHLEY: I'm going to rage.

00:34:18.207 --> 00:34:20.631
MATT: Okay. (laughs)
ASHLEY: Just in case.

00:34:20.632 --> 00:34:21.636
Because I didn't do it.

00:34:21.637 --> 00:34:24.056
MATT: You go into a rage.
TRAVIS: We are in initiative still?

00:34:24.057 --> 00:34:24.890
MATT: Yeah.

00:34:25.854 --> 00:34:28.054
Yasha's the end of the
initiative round, so.

00:34:29.087 --> 00:34:30.520
All right, that finish your turn?

00:34:32.795 --> 00:34:35.346
ASHLEY: I'm going to stab
him again, because I can!

00:34:35.347 --> 00:34:36.694
MATT: Go for it! Go for it.

00:34:36.695 --> 00:34:39.149
TRAVIS: Yeah, don't trust it!
MATT: Go for it.

00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:40.875
ASHLEY: This is too easy,
I don't understand.

00:34:40.876 --> 00:34:43.526
MATT: (laughs)

00:34:43.527 --> 00:34:45.686
ASHLEY: That hits, because
that's more than 21.

00:34:45.687 --> 00:34:47.260
MATT: Yeah, that'll hit.
LAURA: And he's also dead.

00:34:47.261 --> 00:34:48.937
ASHLEY: But he's also dead, so.

00:34:48.938 --> 00:34:50.499
TRAVIS: Is he?

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:51.457
MATT: Roll some damage.

00:34:51.457 --> 00:34:52.290
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:34:53.137 --> 00:34:57.802
That would be-- that's
10, 17, 18, 19, 20,

00:34:57.803 --> 00:34:58.797
28 points of damage.

00:34:58.797 --> 00:34:59.630
MATT: Okay.

00:34:59.631 --> 00:35:01.656
As it hits the ground and
gives out this death screech,

00:35:01.657 --> 00:35:02.940
this (shrieking)

00:35:04.612 --> 00:35:06.186
(choking)

00:35:06.187 --> 00:35:07.976
and just collapses as
you stab its body

00:35:07.977 --> 00:35:09.827
one more time and
pull out the blade.

00:35:10.807 --> 00:35:12.414
And you hear (shrieking)--

00:35:12.415 --> 00:35:13.248
(groaning)

00:35:13.249 --> 00:35:15.026
MATT: -- from further
down the hall this way,

00:35:15.027 --> 00:35:18.380
at the top of the
initiative order, crawling quickly.

00:35:19.267 --> 00:35:20.457
TRAVIS: Oh jeez.
ASHLEY: There we go.

00:35:20.458 --> 00:35:22.064
TRAVIS: I didn't like that sound.
LAURA: Yep.

00:35:22.065 --> 00:35:23.756
MATT: Another one screeches around.

00:35:23.757 --> 00:35:25.216
It looks like a partner of some kind.

00:35:25.217 --> 00:35:27.196
TRAVIS: Hall monitor, slow down.

00:35:27.197 --> 00:35:28.134
MATT: So.

00:35:28.135 --> 00:35:32.236
LAURA: Oh, partner, why you
got to say it like that, Matt?

00:35:32.237 --> 00:35:33.112
MATT: Hey, it attacked you first.

00:35:33.112 --> 00:35:33.953
ASHLEY: It's going to be mad.

00:35:33.954 --> 00:35:35.969
TRAVIS: And they have identical
tattoos on their arms.

00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:37.911
LIAM: Very prominent ring.
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

00:35:37.912 --> 00:35:39.319
TRAVIS: Eiselcross forever.

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:41.376
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:35:41.377 --> 00:35:43.506
LIAM: There's a wedding band
on the third hand.

00:35:43.507 --> 00:35:45.736
MATT: Veth, you're up first.

00:35:45.737 --> 00:35:48.856
SAM: Oh, but I don't even
see this thing yet, do I?

00:35:48.857 --> 00:35:50.836
MATT: No, you heard it,
and you turn around

00:35:50.837 --> 00:35:51.876
and you can see over your shoulder.

00:35:51.877 --> 00:35:55.006
It is now visible around the corner.

00:35:55.007 --> 00:35:58.420
SAM: Okay, but I wouldn't get
any sort of sneaky thing.

00:35:59.637 --> 00:36:00.787
LAURA: It might not see you.

00:36:04.438 --> 00:36:06.138
TRAVIS: (laughs)

00:36:06.139 --> 00:36:08.486
There's a big cone coming
out in about two seconds.

00:36:08.487 --> 00:36:10.187
SAM: You're totally right about that.

00:36:11.837 --> 00:36:13.287
I will--

00:36:14.607 --> 00:36:15.440
Did it see me?

00:36:15.441 --> 00:36:17.596
I don't know what it sees.

00:36:17.597 --> 00:36:18.816
(groans)

00:36:18.817 --> 00:36:21.146
It's going to blast us
with ice again, isn't it?

00:36:21.147 --> 00:36:22.936
I want to run away.

00:36:22.937 --> 00:36:25.426
All right, I will fire--

00:36:25.427 --> 00:36:27.196
Let's see here, I don't want
to use any of my spells.

00:36:27.197 --> 00:36:32.106
He's trying to soften us
for the later stuff.

00:36:32.107 --> 00:36:34.126
MARISHA: This is practice.

00:36:34.127 --> 00:36:35.816
About conservation of energy.

00:36:35.817 --> 00:36:36.956
SAM: Not going to fall for it.

00:36:36.957 --> 00:36:38.496
I'm not going to use my spells.

00:36:38.497 --> 00:36:43.136
I'm just going to fire
a simple crossbow bolt.

00:36:43.137 --> 00:36:44.536
MATT: Go for it, roll for an attack.

00:36:44.537 --> 00:36:45.816
SAM: Okay.

00:36:45.817 --> 00:36:47.426
No sneak attack, natural 20!

00:36:47.427 --> 00:36:48.956
That'll help.
TRAVIS: Yeah!

00:36:48.957 --> 00:36:51.136
SAM: That'll help.
MATT: Yeah.

00:36:51.137 --> 00:36:52.930
SAM: Two plus something.

00:36:53.977 --> 00:36:55.126
Eight points of damage,

00:36:55.127 --> 00:36:57.709
but it fires again automatically.
MATT: Indeed.

00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:59.586
SAM: For 22 to hit.

00:36:59.587 --> 00:37:01.196
MATT: That also hits.

00:37:01.197 --> 00:37:03.726
SAM: Another nine points of damage.

00:37:03.727 --> 00:37:05.166
MATT: Nice.

00:37:05.167 --> 00:37:07.580
SAM: And then, knowing what it can do,

00:37:09.217 --> 00:37:10.886
I'll fire a third time, bonus action.

00:37:10.887 --> 00:37:12.376
MATT: Go for it.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:37:12.377 --> 00:37:13.335
SAM: 23 to hit.

00:37:13.336 --> 00:37:14.799
MATT: That hits, roll damage.

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:17.890
SAM: Another 10 points of damage.

00:37:17.891 --> 00:37:19.266
MATT: Nice!

00:37:19.267 --> 00:37:21.996
SAM: And now I will use
my movement to go that way

00:37:21.997 --> 00:37:25.356
as far away as I can
and hide in the corner.

00:37:25.357 --> 00:37:26.647
MATT: You get up into the rubble here

00:37:26.648 --> 00:37:27.481
in the corner in this space.

00:37:27.482 --> 00:37:28.980
SAM: Put some rubble on top of me.

00:37:28.981 --> 00:37:30.936
MATT: Bury yourself like
Arnold in Predator.

00:37:30.937 --> 00:37:32.256
You got it.

00:37:32.257 --> 00:37:33.486
All righty, finishing Veth's go,

00:37:33.487 --> 00:37:35.666
next up is Jester,
with Caduceus on deck.

00:37:35.667 --> 00:37:37.307
LAURA: Okay. I'm going--

00:37:37.308 --> 00:37:39.786
MATT: You just barely--
You almost got crushed

00:37:39.787 --> 00:37:42.106
as it fell to the ground as Yasha sprays

00:37:42.107 --> 00:37:43.446
part of its innards across the way

00:37:43.447 --> 00:37:45.466
and a little bit (spits) across you.

00:37:45.467 --> 00:37:46.596
You feel the cold sensation.

00:37:46.597 --> 00:37:47.826
You hear the screech and look over

00:37:47.827 --> 00:37:49.186
as that creature just rounds the corner

00:37:49.187 --> 00:37:50.736
after dropping off of the wall.

00:37:50.737 --> 00:37:52.696
LAURA: Fuck!
MATT: What are you doing?

00:37:52.697 --> 00:37:54.286
LAURA: I'm going to send
my duplicate forward

00:37:54.287 --> 00:37:57.007
as far as she can go,
which is 30 feet.

00:37:57.008 --> 00:37:58.236
MATT: Right.

00:37:58.237 --> 00:38:00.518
LAURA: So probably just like, yeah.

00:38:00.519 --> 00:38:03.099
MATT: About there?
LAURA: That's good.

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:04.576
Me personally,

00:38:04.577 --> 00:38:08.496
I'm going to fire a Sacred-- no.

00:38:08.497 --> 00:38:11.306
A Toll the Dead at it.

00:38:11.307 --> 00:38:12.396
MATT: Okay.

00:38:12.397 --> 00:38:13.856
That is a constitution save or wisdom?

00:38:13.857 --> 00:38:15.656
LAURA: That is a wisdom save.

00:38:15.657 --> 00:38:16.577
MATT: Wisdom save.

00:38:16.578 --> 00:38:18.636
That is a 10 total.

00:38:18.637 --> 00:38:23.561
LAURA: Hoh-ha, that means it takes 3d12.

00:38:23.562 --> 00:38:24.946
MATT: It has not been wounded yet.

00:38:24.947 --> 00:38:26.186
LAURA: "This spell--

00:38:26.187 --> 00:38:28.686
"One die when you reach 5th level." What am I?

00:38:28.687 --> 00:38:29.756
I'm 11th--

00:38:29.757 --> 00:38:31.256
SAM: Didn't I wound it a bunch of times?

00:38:31.257 --> 00:38:32.686
MATT: Oh, no, what am
I saying? I'm dumb.

00:38:32.687 --> 00:38:33.520
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: Go ahead.

00:38:33.521 --> 00:38:34.756
LAURA: 3d12.

00:38:34.757 --> 00:38:37.002
MATT: My brain.

00:38:37.003 --> 00:38:39.956
LAURA: Which is here, here, and here.

00:38:39.957 --> 00:38:42.040
I never get to use my 12s.

00:38:43.337 --> 00:38:45.546
TRAVIS: Crack it out.
MATT: Don't know why I said that.

00:38:45.547 --> 00:38:48.184
LAURA: That's a 20, so.

00:38:48.185 --> 00:38:49.835
I'm like, "Ooh, 16!"

00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:51.987
MATT: (laughs) On a d12.

00:38:51.988 --> 00:38:56.569
LAURA: Nine plus 11 is 20,

00:38:56.570 --> 00:38:58.346
plus one is 22.

00:38:58.347 --> 00:39:00.766
MATT: 22 points of damage to it.

00:39:00.767 --> 00:39:03.496
LAURA: And a giant bell
envelops its head and dong!

00:39:03.497 --> 00:39:06.366
MATT: Rings inside of it like
a like a Looney Toons cartoon.

00:39:06.367 --> 00:39:08.206
It's like (snarling).

00:39:08.207 --> 00:39:12.516
LAURA: And then I am
going to duck behind,

00:39:12.517 --> 00:39:15.106
lay down on the ground
and duck underneath

00:39:15.107 --> 00:39:16.876
the body of its partner.

00:39:16.877 --> 00:39:18.976
Its dead lover.

00:39:18.977 --> 00:39:21.816
And try to block myself
from whatever cold blast

00:39:21.817 --> 00:39:23.204
it sends out.

00:39:23.205 --> 00:39:24.456
MATT: I would like you to
make an athletics check

00:39:24.457 --> 00:39:26.290
to see if you can push
under its massive, heavy frame.

00:39:30.587 --> 00:39:31.966
SAM: As you go down there you see,

00:39:31.967 --> 00:39:35.012
like, a pouch full of love letters

00:39:35.013 --> 00:39:37.236
that they've written to each other.

00:39:37.237 --> 00:39:38.746
And poetry.

00:39:38.747 --> 00:39:40.676
LAURA: That would be a nine.

00:39:40.677 --> 00:39:41.527
MATT: A nine.

00:39:41.528 --> 00:39:46.196
You are trying to move it, but
this is a massive creature,

00:39:46.197 --> 00:39:50.326
and you get an arm under it for now.

00:39:50.327 --> 00:39:51.516
LAURA: Okay.

00:39:51.517 --> 00:39:52.746
MATT: Okay.

00:39:52.747 --> 00:39:53.816
That finishes Jester's turn.

00:39:53.817 --> 00:39:56.282
Caduceus, you're up.
TRAVIS: (laughing) It's just a big ape.

00:39:56.283 --> 00:39:57.398
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:39:57.399 --> 00:40:00.217
MATT: I know. (laughs)

00:40:00.218 --> 00:40:02.885
(groaning)

00:40:06.727 --> 00:40:07.756
TALIESIN: How far would I have?

00:40:07.757 --> 00:40:09.146
Can I see the thing yet or no?

00:40:09.147 --> 00:40:10.446
MATT: Yes, you can.

00:40:10.447 --> 00:40:11.958
You have line of sight to it.

00:40:11.959 --> 00:40:16.959
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm just going to
take a basic as hell

00:40:17.967 --> 00:40:18.877
Sacred Flame at it.

00:40:18.877 --> 00:40:19.717
MATT: Sacred Flame?

00:40:19.718 --> 00:40:21.317
Wisdom or dex save?
TALIESIN: Dex save.

00:40:22.283 --> 00:40:23.730
MATT: Ooh, 18?

00:40:24.777 --> 00:40:25.610
TALIESIN: 18.

00:40:25.611 --> 00:40:27.126
MATT: 18, so it does make the save.

00:40:27.127 --> 00:40:27.960
TALIESIN: So--

00:40:31.697 --> 00:40:33.166
19 halved.

00:40:33.167 --> 00:40:34.000
MATT: All right.

00:40:34.001 --> 00:40:37.651
LAURA: You get to do damage even though

00:40:37.652 --> 00:40:38.647
he makes the save?

00:40:38.648 --> 00:40:40.215
MATT: Sacred Flame, I think,
is half damage or no damage?

00:40:40.216 --> 00:40:41.466
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's--

00:40:44.537 --> 00:40:46.356
Oh, wait, yeah, it's--

00:40:46.357 --> 00:40:48.126
LAURA: I think if they make the
save, you don't do anything.

00:40:48.127 --> 00:40:51.246
TALIESIN: Yep, never mind.
No damage at all, you're right.

00:40:51.247 --> 00:40:53.305
MATT: You got it.
SAM: The flannel's affecting you.

00:40:53.306 --> 00:40:54.247
MATT: (laughs)

00:40:54.248 --> 00:40:56.056
We're all a little fried at the moment.

00:40:56.057 --> 00:40:57.218
LAURA: I didn't know,
because grave clerics

00:40:57.219 --> 00:40:58.302
sometimes have cool things that--

00:40:58.303 --> 00:40:59.776
TALIESIN: Yeah, I have,
like, weird shit.

00:40:59.777 --> 00:41:02.026
I'm then going to back off
into the corner.

00:41:02.027 --> 00:41:04.016
The far corner, as far as I can.

00:41:04.017 --> 00:41:04.920
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:41:05.807 --> 00:41:06.826
MATT: The one space you would have

00:41:06.827 --> 00:41:09.036
is currently occupied by--
SAM: Get away from me!

00:41:09.037 --> 00:41:10.115
(laughter)

00:41:10.116 --> 00:41:12.297
Get away from me!

00:41:12.298 --> 00:41:14.509
This is my mound of rubble,
get your own!

00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:19.510
(laughter)

00:41:19.862 --> 00:41:21.626
MATT: All right.
TALIESIN: All right.

00:41:21.627 --> 00:41:23.994
SAM: Or use your body to block me, but--

00:41:25.971 --> 00:41:26.869
ASHLEY: "Get away from me!"

00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:29.528
MATT: You see as the creature
now scurries around.

00:41:29.529 --> 00:41:30.362
TRAVIS: "No!"

00:41:32.129 --> 00:41:34.396
MATT: (snarling)

00:41:34.397 --> 00:41:36.265
SAM: Oh no, it sees its lover down.
MATT: Skitters over.

00:41:36.266 --> 00:41:38.241
LAURA: Oh no.

00:41:38.242 --> 00:41:39.916
MATT: It is going to--

00:41:39.917 --> 00:41:41.917
Looking at the giant ape in front of it.

00:41:43.161 --> 00:41:44.346
(snarls)

00:41:44.347 --> 00:41:45.786
Unleash another.

00:41:45.787 --> 00:41:47.437
SAM: Oh boy, here we go, here we go.

00:41:48.657 --> 00:41:50.311
MATT: That gets everybody.

00:41:50.312 --> 00:41:51.951
LAURA: You know, the smarter move,
instead of burying myself,

00:41:51.952 --> 00:41:53.121
would've been to run away.

00:41:53.122 --> 00:41:55.602
SAM: (laughs)
LAURA: That would have been a smart--

00:41:55.603 --> 00:41:58.779
TRAVIS: ♪ Everybody, everybody,
everybody, everybody ♪

00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:01.230
TALIESIN: Everyone always
wants to hide under the bed.

00:42:01.231 --> 00:42:03.056
LAURA: Yeah.

00:42:03.057 --> 00:42:05.521
TALIESIN: I feel like you
should get a cover bonus.

00:42:05.522 --> 00:42:06.355
MATT: Yeah, I don't know.

00:42:06.356 --> 00:42:07.605
LAURA: I don't know.

00:42:10.267 --> 00:42:11.571
Oh, a constitution saving throw?

00:42:11.572 --> 00:42:13.686
MARISHA: Oh, we have
to save, right? Throw?

00:42:13.687 --> 00:42:15.119
TRAVIS: Yeah.
TALIESIN: You got a d4.

00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:16.326
MATT: Indeed, saving throw again.

00:42:16.327 --> 00:42:18.216
Constitution.
TRAVIS: New dice, new dice.

00:42:18.217 --> 00:42:19.831
LAURA: 17.
MARISHA: Okay, oh!

00:42:19.832 --> 00:42:22.531
TRAVIS: Natural 20 on the new dice.

00:42:22.532 --> 00:42:23.788
TALIESIN: Add a d4.
TRAVIS: 25.

00:42:23.789 --> 00:42:24.997
MATT: So 26 cold damage.

00:42:24.998 --> 00:42:25.831
TRAVIS: Okay.
MATT: What'd you get?

00:42:25.832 --> 00:42:28.040
LAURA: 17.
MATT: 17 just succeeds.

00:42:28.987 --> 00:42:30.641
26 cold damage.

00:42:30.642 --> 00:42:32.286
LAURA: 13, because half.

00:42:32.287 --> 00:42:33.120
MATT: Correct.

00:42:33.121 --> 00:42:34.396
LIAM: Seven.
MATT: Seven.

00:42:34.397 --> 00:42:36.226
That is 52 points of cold damage.

00:42:36.227 --> 00:42:38.527
TRAVIS: Fuck!
SAM: Ooh, are you okay?

00:42:38.528 --> 00:42:39.361
ASHLEY: 15?

00:42:39.361 --> 00:42:40.194
MATT: 15?

00:42:40.195 --> 00:42:41.946
52 points of cold damage.

00:42:41.947 --> 00:42:43.336
Yes.

00:42:43.337 --> 00:42:44.906
Beauregard.

00:42:44.907 --> 00:42:45.755
MARISHA: 31.

00:42:45.756 --> 00:42:46.936
MATT: 31.

00:42:46.937 --> 00:42:48.077
26 points of cold damage.
LIAM: I'd be a skid mark

00:42:48.078 --> 00:42:49.626
if I was a human right now.

00:42:49.627 --> 00:42:50.750
TALIESIN: Anyone hurting bad?

00:42:51.727 --> 00:42:53.141
LAURA: Caleb when he's not a gorilla.

00:42:53.142 --> 00:42:53.975
TALIESIN: Well, Caleb's a gorilla.

00:42:53.976 --> 00:42:55.498
MATT: It's going to go ahead
and use the rest of its movement

00:42:55.499 --> 00:42:58.000
to scurry back into
this space defensively.

00:42:59.427 --> 00:43:00.966
That's going to end its turn.

00:43:00.967 --> 00:43:03.976
Next up is Essek.

00:43:03.977 --> 00:43:06.127
Oh, Essek also, I need
to roll for him, too.

00:43:07.977 --> 00:43:12.975
He did not make his save.
He takes 52 points of cold damage.

00:43:12.976 --> 00:43:14.041
LAURA: 52 points?!

00:43:14.042 --> 00:43:16.086
LIAM: Baby boy.
MATT: Yeah.

00:43:16.087 --> 00:43:17.336
LAURA: We all took, oh.

00:43:17.337 --> 00:43:19.936
MATT: You succeeded on your save,
so you took half, which is 26.

00:43:19.937 --> 00:43:21.462
LAURA: God.
LIAM: Sure.

00:43:22.757 --> 00:43:24.816
MATT: Yeah, so he's-- yeah, he like--

00:43:24.817 --> 00:43:26.744
he's half hit points in one go.

00:43:26.745 --> 00:43:28.836
TRAVIS: Will you point
to him on the map?

00:43:28.837 --> 00:43:29.727
Got it.

00:43:29.728 --> 00:43:30.946
MATT: Yeah, but it's a 60-foot cone,

00:43:30.947 --> 00:43:32.731
this thing goes quite a ways.

00:43:32.732 --> 00:43:34.043
SAM: Near the ape.

00:43:35.527 --> 00:43:36.766
MATT: Angrily--

00:43:36.767 --> 00:43:37.687
SAM: What an angle.

00:43:37.687 --> 00:43:38.520
LAURA: That's cool.
TALIESIN: Love it.

00:43:38.521 --> 00:43:40.460
TRAVIS: That's a great angle!

00:43:40.461 --> 00:43:41.570
(laughter)

00:43:41.571 --> 00:43:43.270
MATT: (roaring)
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

00:43:43.271 --> 00:43:44.736
MATT: That's amazing.

00:43:44.737 --> 00:43:45.570
TALIESIN: That's everything
I ever wanted.

00:43:45.571 --> 00:43:47.626
TRAVIS: (roaring)

00:43:47.627 --> 00:43:50.656
Put a bone jaw in his hand.

00:43:50.657 --> 00:43:52.536
MATT: Could you make a
concentration check for me,

00:43:52.537 --> 00:43:54.606
Laura, if you don't mind?

00:43:54.607 --> 00:43:56.707
LAURA: Oh, with advantage
because of War Caster.

00:43:58.097 --> 00:44:00.186
16 plus my con save's a 20.

00:44:00.187 --> 00:44:01.546
So I'm fine.
MATT: Yeah, you're fine.

00:44:01.547 --> 00:44:02.380
Okay.

00:44:02.381 --> 00:44:04.176
LAURA: Thank you for the
reminder, I'm sorry, I forgot.

00:44:04.177 --> 00:44:05.010
MATT: It's all good.

00:44:06.197 --> 00:44:07.030
Let's see here.

00:44:13.597 --> 00:44:16.607
Okay, yeah, Essek is
going to go ahead and--

00:44:18.849 --> 00:44:20.476
Can just barely see out
of the corner there.

00:44:20.477 --> 00:44:21.726
Everyone's clustered in the middle

00:44:21.727 --> 00:44:24.090
and he's like, "I can't get free.

00:44:24.091 --> 00:44:26.629
"(sighs)" He's going
to go ahead and use a

00:44:27.616 --> 00:44:32.616
3rd-level Magic Missile
to just arc around at it.

00:44:32.944 --> 00:44:34.624
SAM: Interesting.

00:44:34.625 --> 00:44:36.836
The ol' Magic Missile.

00:44:36.837 --> 00:44:38.045
TALIESIN: Tried and true.

00:44:46.133 --> 00:44:47.189
MATT: Okay.

00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:51.526
SAM and TALIESIN:
♪ (sing with background music) ♪

00:44:51.527 --> 00:44:53.816
MATT: As all of these little
beams of force begin to appear

00:44:53.817 --> 00:44:55.396
at the ends of his fingers
and one in the palm,

00:44:55.397 --> 00:44:57.236
they gather into these small,

00:44:57.237 --> 00:44:59.346
condensed balls of
purple-blue energy

00:44:59.347 --> 00:45:02.026
before they all spiral out,
arcing through everyone

00:45:02.027 --> 00:45:04.506
like anime missiles,
through the nooks and crannies,

00:45:04.507 --> 00:45:06.956
and then exploding on
the side of the creature

00:45:06.957 --> 00:45:10.576
as it withdraws even
further into the hallway.

00:45:10.577 --> 00:45:13.626
And with that, Essek's
going to go ahead and run

00:45:13.627 --> 00:45:15.226
and put his back against the other wall

00:45:15.227 --> 00:45:18.186
on the opposite side, going (panting),

00:45:18.187 --> 00:45:19.836
and like dust some of the icicles

00:45:19.837 --> 00:45:22.606
that have gathered on
the edge of his mantle.

00:45:22.607 --> 00:45:23.966
Beauregard, you're up.
Caleb, you're on deck.

00:45:23.967 --> 00:45:25.053
MARISHA: Oh.

00:45:25.054 --> 00:45:25.887
Uh.

00:45:25.888 --> 00:45:27.106
Huh?

00:45:27.107 --> 00:45:29.066
Okay, where am I?

00:45:29.067 --> 00:45:31.546
MATT: You are over here
on the opposite side

00:45:31.547 --> 00:45:34.136
of the dead creature.

00:45:34.137 --> 00:45:37.810
MARISHA: I can get to
Randall, too, right?

00:45:38.877 --> 00:45:39.754
MATT: Likely, it depends.

00:45:39.755 --> 00:45:41.854
You want to go over
the body or around it?

00:45:44.997 --> 00:45:46.396
MARISHA: Over it.

00:45:46.397 --> 00:45:49.820
MATT: Okay, so using the
corpse as a stepping point,

00:45:50.707 --> 00:45:53.776
over, that'll put you
just enough movement

00:45:53.777 --> 00:45:54.610
to get up to where it is.

00:45:54.611 --> 00:45:56.926
LAURA: I imagine it was like a
vault, a one-handed vault over.

00:45:56.927 --> 00:45:58.626
Yeah. Something real cool.
MARISHA: You know.

00:45:58.627 --> 00:46:00.922
Like it's a Cadillac, but it's not.

00:46:00.923 --> 00:46:02.823
MATT: Yeah, you'll get
there, just enough.

00:46:03.657 --> 00:46:04.666
MARISHA: Pop pop.

00:46:04.667 --> 00:46:05.500
MATT: Go for it.

00:46:07.152 --> 00:46:08.260
SAM: Bob Bob.

00:46:09.257 --> 00:46:12.686
MARISHA: Ooh, my luck might be coming--

00:46:12.687 --> 00:46:13.520
Okay, okay.

00:46:13.521 --> 00:46:14.831
Oh wait, you're right, I have d4s.

00:46:14.832 --> 00:46:15.665
TALIESIN: d4s.

00:46:15.666 --> 00:46:20.436
MARISHA: Okay so that's 12,
12 plus seven is 19,

00:46:20.437 --> 00:46:21.988
plus--

00:46:21.989 --> 00:46:23.399
TALIESIN: Math.

00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:26.916
MARISHA: For the first one,
plus one, so 20 total?

00:46:26.917 --> 00:46:28.356
MATT: Actually, remind me, Caduceus.

00:46:28.357 --> 00:46:29.416
You took damage last--

00:46:29.417 --> 00:46:31.140
No, that's right, you were.

00:46:31.141 --> 00:46:31.974
TALIESIN: I'm all right.

00:46:31.974 --> 00:46:32.974
MARISHA: 20 and 21?

00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:35.968
MATT: 20 and 21 both hit.

00:46:35.968 --> 00:46:36.801
MARISHA: Okay.

00:46:38.107 --> 00:46:38.940
And--

00:46:38.941 --> 00:46:40.026
Oh no, my eye is twitching.

00:46:40.027 --> 00:46:40.860
Oh no.

00:46:42.867 --> 00:46:43.700
Shit.

00:46:45.267 --> 00:46:48.326
The first one is 13 points of damage

00:46:48.327 --> 00:46:50.887
and the next one is 15 points of damage.

00:46:51.721 --> 00:46:52.836
MATT: Nice, all right.

00:46:52.837 --> 00:46:54.426
Rushing around over
the body, using the momentum

00:46:54.427 --> 00:46:56.666
as you rushed down
into it, whack, whack!

00:46:56.667 --> 00:46:59.866
Both hits impact it and
you see it now, it,

00:46:59.867 --> 00:47:01.596
as you come towards it,
trying to defend itself,

00:47:01.597 --> 00:47:03.646
putting up its front legs
almost defensively

00:47:03.647 --> 00:47:05.386
with its claws out and
you just move around it

00:47:05.387 --> 00:47:06.586
and hit it twice.

00:47:06.587 --> 00:47:07.981
What else are you doing?

00:47:07.982 --> 00:47:09.032
That was your action.

00:47:10.897 --> 00:47:13.660
MARISHA: Man, I really
want to save my shit.

00:47:14.697 --> 00:47:19.224
I'm going to move to the side.

00:47:19.225 --> 00:47:22.083
Can I move this way around it?

00:47:22.084 --> 00:47:23.624
MATT: You are pretty much
at your movement

00:47:23.625 --> 00:47:25.291
to climb over it.
MARISHA: Oh, I've already done all that.

00:47:25.292 --> 00:47:26.637
You're right, you're right.

00:47:31.927 --> 00:47:33.286
I will do nothing.

00:47:33.287 --> 00:47:34.426
I will wait.

00:47:34.427 --> 00:47:35.877
MATT: Okay, bonus action nothing?

00:47:37.890 --> 00:47:40.388
MARISHA: I don't-- no, don't, no.

00:47:40.389 --> 00:47:41.222
TRAVIS: (giggles)

00:47:41.223 --> 00:47:42.896
MATT: You get a free one hit
for a bonus action.

00:47:42.897 --> 00:47:44.604
MARISHA: Oh, that's right,
I do. Yeah, I'll punch it.

00:47:44.605 --> 00:47:45.438
MATT: There you go.
MARISHA: I'm always used

00:47:45.439 --> 00:47:47.028
to spending ki points and stuff.

00:47:47.029 --> 00:47:48.394
MATT: Yeah, you just
get one instead of two.

00:47:48.395 --> 00:47:49.847
LIAM: Don't trust him, Marisha,
he's still fucking with you.

00:47:49.848 --> 00:47:51.736
MARISHA: I know, I know.

00:47:51.737 --> 00:47:54.616
He knows what he's doing.

00:47:54.617 --> 00:47:56.576
That hits, that's 28?

00:47:56.577 --> 00:47:57.410
MATT: 28 hits.

00:47:58.467 --> 00:48:00.283
And that's--

00:48:00.284 --> 00:48:02.786
MATT: Beauregard, this area's
also collapsed inward.

00:48:02.787 --> 00:48:03.786
MARISHA: Yeah.
LAURA: Well, there you go.

00:48:03.787 --> 00:48:04.960
MARISHA: Okay.
LAURA: Answers our question.

00:48:04.961 --> 00:48:06.275
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:48:06.276 --> 00:48:07.154
10 damage.

00:48:07.155 --> 00:48:08.676
MATT: 10 damage?

00:48:08.677 --> 00:48:09.607
All righty.

00:48:09.608 --> 00:48:11.006
Now that finishes you go?

00:48:11.007 --> 00:48:12.416
MARISHA: Yep.

00:48:12.417 --> 00:48:15.196
MATT: Capeleb.
LIAM: Capeleb, yes.

00:48:15.197 --> 00:48:18.536
So Capeleb just took this
giant blast of ice cold

00:48:18.537 --> 00:48:22.226
and he is a white giant ape
with auburn speckles

00:48:22.227 --> 00:48:24.096
all over him, and as soon as
he takes that blast

00:48:24.097 --> 00:48:27.406
and watches it skitter away,
he just (growling),

00:48:27.407 --> 00:48:30.116
watches it go, and I also
see Beauregard run up.

00:48:30.117 --> 00:48:33.156
So I'm going to arc slowly
in a circle around

00:48:33.157 --> 00:48:37.316
to the side of this tiny-ass,
motherfucking monster's face.

00:48:37.317 --> 00:48:42.317
I'm not going to use both hands,
I'm going to go (roaring grunts).

00:48:43.142 --> 00:48:45.376
MATT: Just going to
cartoon Popeye wind up?

00:48:45.377 --> 00:48:46.217
Hell yeah.

00:48:46.218 --> 00:48:47.626
(laughs)

00:48:47.627 --> 00:48:48.460
Go for it.

00:48:49.467 --> 00:48:51.507
LIAM: First attack is a--

00:48:52.915 --> 00:48:54.206
18 to hit.

00:48:54.207 --> 00:48:55.636
MATT: 18 hits.
Fjord, you're on deck.

00:48:55.637 --> 00:48:57.846
LIAM: Second is higher.

00:48:57.847 --> 00:48:58.680
25 to hit.

00:48:58.681 --> 00:48:59.970
MATT: Both hit, go ahead
and roll damage.

00:48:59.971 --> 00:49:00.804
LIAM: Okay.

00:49:03.097 --> 00:49:06.217
So the first one, first punch does--

00:49:07.275 --> 00:49:09.976
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:49:09.977 --> 00:49:11.656
LIAM: 25 for the first.

00:49:11.657 --> 00:49:13.156
MATT: Nice.

00:49:14.048 --> 00:49:15.896
LIAM: 10, 15.

00:49:15.897 --> 00:49:17.140
21 for the second.

00:49:21.846 --> 00:49:23.413
LAURA: That's so good.

00:49:24.438 --> 00:49:27.196
LIAM: And then I'm just
going to breathe hard in its face

00:49:27.197 --> 00:49:28.236
for the rest of my turn.

00:49:28.237 --> 00:49:31.246
MATT: As you heavily breathe,
it breathes back,

00:49:31.247 --> 00:49:33.576
the slobber extending with that same

00:49:33.577 --> 00:49:35.206
white-blue blood pouring of its mouth.

00:49:35.207 --> 00:49:37.236
It's looking pretty hurt.

00:49:37.237 --> 00:49:38.070
All right.

00:49:38.071 --> 00:49:39.316
That finishes your turn, Caleb.

00:49:39.317 --> 00:49:41.296
Fjord, you're up.
Yasha, you're on deck.

00:49:41.297 --> 00:49:43.647
TRAVIS: I will move up so
that I have a line of sight

00:49:44.597 --> 00:49:47.046
so I can see him, even if
it's only a square or two

00:49:47.047 --> 00:49:48.232
that is needed.

00:49:48.233 --> 00:49:49.596
MATT: You can get about
there and you can have

00:49:49.597 --> 00:49:50.906
a very clear view of it.

00:49:50.907 --> 00:49:54.096
As Beauregard is defensively
handling herself

00:49:54.097 --> 00:49:55.626
below it into the side,
the giant ape

00:49:55.627 --> 00:49:57.716
is just pummeling it
into the wall repeatedly.

00:49:57.717 --> 00:49:58.550
TRAVIS: Excellent.

00:49:58.551 --> 00:50:01.043
I will take the Glove of Blasting out

00:50:01.044 --> 00:50:03.346
that hasn't seen some action in a minute.

00:50:03.347 --> 00:50:04.180
LIAM: Throwback.

00:50:04.181 --> 00:50:09.180
TRAVIS: And I will fire
three rays of fire into its chest.

00:50:09.355 --> 00:50:10.188
MATT: Go for it.

00:50:10.188 --> 00:50:11.070
LAURA: Three!
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:50:11.071 --> 00:50:12.317
MATT: Roll for an attack on each.

00:50:13.283 --> 00:50:14.966
TRAVIS: That's 25 to hit.
MATT: That hits.

00:50:14.967 --> 00:50:17.396
TRAVIS: Second one is 16 to hit.

00:50:17.397 --> 00:50:18.576
MATT: 16 misses.

00:50:18.577 --> 00:50:21.684
TRAVIS: Okay, and the
third one is 22 to hit.

00:50:21.685 --> 00:50:24.283
MATT: Two of them hit,
so that's 4d6, I believe?

00:50:24.284 --> 00:50:25.616
TRAVIS: It's 2d6.

00:50:25.617 --> 00:50:26.584
MATT: Each hit.
TRAVIS: Yes.

00:50:26.585 --> 00:50:28.467
MATT: So two of them hit,
so it's 4d6 total.

00:50:29.697 --> 00:50:31.310
TRAVIS: That is six--

00:50:32.567 --> 00:50:34.492
And five.

00:50:34.493 --> 00:50:37.336
So 11, 11 points of fire damage.

00:50:37.337 --> 00:50:38.811
MATT: Doubled to 22.

00:50:38.812 --> 00:50:39.800
Fjord, how do you want to do this?

00:50:39.801 --> 00:50:41.865
ALL: Hey!

00:50:41.866 --> 00:50:45.078
TRAVIS: I'll just take the glove and go:

00:50:45.079 --> 00:50:46.622
(clicking) Pew pew!

00:50:46.623 --> 00:50:48.929
(laughter)

00:50:48.930 --> 00:50:49.780
LIAM: Two throwbacks.

00:50:50.749 --> 00:50:51.872
MATT: (laughs)

00:50:51.873 --> 00:50:52.806
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:50:52.807 --> 00:50:55.076
MATT: As you pull the glove
and the blasts go free,

00:50:55.077 --> 00:50:57.226
one of them just manages
to miss as it pulls back

00:50:57.227 --> 00:51:00.326
from the blow that the
giant ape Caleb had knocked into it.

00:51:00.327 --> 00:51:02.146
The other two impact
the side of its neck

00:51:02.147 --> 00:51:03.636
and the middle of
its belly, and as it does,

00:51:03.637 --> 00:51:05.796
the flames catch,
and it begins to shriek

00:51:05.797 --> 00:51:07.406
as you watch its flesh begin to burn.

00:51:07.407 --> 00:51:09.236
It backs up all the way into the corner,

00:51:09.237 --> 00:51:11.466
trying to look out and defend itself

00:51:11.467 --> 00:51:13.216
from the pain that it's feeling,

00:51:13.217 --> 00:51:15.066
but the flames are
too bright and it cannot see

00:51:15.067 --> 00:51:16.186
and you watch it thrash for a bit

00:51:16.187 --> 00:51:18.966
before it slowly just stops
moving in the flames,

00:51:18.967 --> 00:51:21.395
its body just burns in the far corner.

00:51:21.396 --> 00:51:22.229
TRAVIS: Yasha?

00:51:24.564 --> 00:51:25.796
ASHLEY: Well, it's dead.

00:51:25.797 --> 00:51:27.497
SAM: You better stab it again.
TRAVIS: That never stopped you before.

00:51:27.498 --> 00:51:28.741
ASHLEY: I'll fucking stab it.

00:51:28.742 --> 00:51:30.400
(laughter)

00:51:30.401 --> 00:51:33.956
SAM: Wait, last time you
stabbed, another one showed up.

00:51:33.957 --> 00:51:35.366
Maybe that's what did it.

00:51:35.367 --> 00:51:36.200
ASHLEY: Too late.

00:51:37.217 --> 00:51:38.927
Okay, that total would be--

00:51:42.067 --> 00:51:43.396
19.

00:51:43.397 --> 00:51:44.716
MATT: 19.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:51:44.717 --> 00:51:45.999
MATT: Okay.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:46.877
That hits.

00:51:46.877 --> 00:51:47.710
Roll damage.

00:51:48.707 --> 00:51:51.647
LIAM: It's me, the third creature
in this open relationship.

00:51:51.648 --> 00:51:54.476
(laughter)

00:51:54.477 --> 00:51:55.310
ASHLEY: How close am I?

00:51:55.311 --> 00:51:57.617
TRAVIS: Out comes its child,
like, "Mom, Dad?"

00:51:57.618 --> 00:51:58.612
(laughter)

00:51:58.613 --> 00:52:01.333
ASHLEY: Don't know where
I am on the map, there we go.

00:52:01.334 --> 00:52:03.120
MATT: We'll say you can get over there.

00:52:03.121 --> 00:52:05.566
ASHLEY: I'll just, like,
you know, since it's already dead,

00:52:05.567 --> 00:52:09.506
I'll just, like, poke it.

00:52:09.507 --> 00:52:11.166
MATT: Okay.

00:52:11.167 --> 00:52:12.556
You're poking through
the flames, by the way.

00:52:12.557 --> 00:52:14.726
Its body is engulfed
in fire at the moment.

00:52:14.727 --> 00:52:15.560
ASHLEY: Great.

00:52:15.561 --> 00:52:17.646
MATT: And you're like--
ASHLEY: Just half-heartedly.

00:52:17.647 --> 00:52:18.607
MATT: Okay.

00:52:18.607 --> 00:52:19.440
All right.

00:52:21.297 --> 00:52:22.686
ASHLEY: Let me--
TRAVIS: Add it up.

00:52:22.687 --> 00:52:23.520
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:52:23.521 --> 00:52:26.151
(laughter)

00:52:27.207 --> 00:52:28.650
TRAVIS: You roll it. You add it.

00:52:28.651 --> 00:52:30.209
SAM: Dead.
MARISHA: (like Ashley) Okay.

00:52:31.647 --> 00:52:34.036
ASHLEY: Let's go with 25.

00:52:34.037 --> 00:52:36.056
MATT: Sure.
(laughter)

00:52:36.057 --> 00:52:38.356
Okay, stabbing through
the crackling flames,

00:52:38.357 --> 00:52:40.836
its body just goes more and more limp

00:52:40.837 --> 00:52:42.400
as it eventually expires.

00:52:43.777 --> 00:52:46.130
All right, does that finish your turn?

00:52:46.131 --> 00:52:47.246
ASHLEY: Well.

00:52:47.247 --> 00:52:50.353
Maybe I better prep for,
you know, another one.

00:52:51.617 --> 00:52:53.544
TRAVIS: Oh, we're still in initiative?

00:52:53.545 --> 00:52:54.430
ASHLEY: We're still in initiative.

00:52:54.431 --> 00:52:55.776
TRAVIS: I was fucking around.

00:52:55.777 --> 00:52:56.693
SAM: Mean nothing.

00:53:00.367 --> 00:53:04.576
ASHLEY: I'm going to hold my
action, the rest of my turn,

00:53:04.577 --> 00:53:05.410
can you do that?

00:53:05.411 --> 00:53:07.354
MATT: Well, you've already
done your action to attack, so.

00:53:07.355 --> 00:53:09.626
ASHLEY: My second action, can I hold?

00:53:09.627 --> 00:53:10.876
MATT: Nah.
TRAVIS: Second breakfast?

00:53:10.877 --> 00:53:12.127
ASHLEY: Yeah, second breakfast?

00:53:13.537 --> 00:53:14.586
I'll stay.

00:53:14.587 --> 00:53:17.496
MATT: Okay, there is a
giant gorilla next to you.

00:53:17.497 --> 00:53:18.780
ASHLEY: I'll give him a little scritch.

00:53:18.781 --> 00:53:20.446
MATT: Okay.
(laughter)

00:53:20.447 --> 00:53:21.280
MATT: All right.

00:53:21.281 --> 00:53:23.300
Top of the combat round, back to Veth.

00:53:25.747 --> 00:53:28.276
As you and Caduceus quietly

00:53:28.277 --> 00:53:30.136
keep yourselves there and
engage the tension there,

00:53:30.137 --> 00:53:34.096
looking around the chamber, the silence,

00:53:34.097 --> 00:53:35.866
other than the crackling of the flames

00:53:35.867 --> 00:53:38.117
of the second creature
burning in the corner.

00:53:40.387 --> 00:53:41.490
Moment passes.

00:53:42.757 --> 00:53:43.590
A few more.

00:53:45.907 --> 00:53:49.446
You begin to loosen up a bit,
feeling that perhaps

00:53:49.447 --> 00:53:52.530
whatever this encounter
was has come to a close.

00:53:53.377 --> 00:53:55.430
LIAM: A fart like a Mack truck
comes out of the ape.

00:53:55.431 --> 00:53:56.282
LAURA: No.

00:53:56.283 --> 00:53:59.146
TRAVIS: Is there any brown mold
in this hallway?

00:53:59.147 --> 00:54:01.012
For the fire?

00:54:01.013 --> 00:54:02.072
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:54:02.073 --> 00:54:02.906
LAURA: Oh.

00:54:05.527 --> 00:54:06.968
TRAVIS: 18.

00:54:06.969 --> 00:54:09.611
LAURA: Oh, you sneaky, sneaky bastard.

00:54:09.612 --> 00:54:11.366
TRAVIS: 21.

00:54:11.367 --> 00:54:12.200
MATT: 21.

00:54:13.227 --> 00:54:16.826
There is a bunch of black mold
on the back edge

00:54:16.827 --> 00:54:19.736
of this hallway that
you can rapidly see now

00:54:19.737 --> 00:54:21.776
is shifting in towards the flames

00:54:21.777 --> 00:54:23.616
from the corners of the
wall, and you watch

00:54:23.617 --> 00:54:25.846
as it begins to move inward,
the fire that has

00:54:25.847 --> 00:54:29.186
engulfed the creature
begins to be snuffed out.

00:54:29.187 --> 00:54:31.879
Something is consuming the heat
from it as the mold expands.

00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:33.070
TRAVIS: Gotta move.

00:54:33.071 --> 00:54:33.904
SAM: Gotta move?

00:54:33.905 --> 00:54:37.186
This was supposed to
be our ambush point.

00:54:37.187 --> 00:54:38.117
TALIESIN: Later.

00:54:38.118 --> 00:54:39.436
SAM: Later!?
TALIESIN: Moving on.

00:54:39.437 --> 00:54:40.919
SAM: Moving on!?
LAURA: What, moving on?

00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:44.527
The more we fight, the more
we're going to just get hurt.

00:54:44.528 --> 00:54:45.786
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:54:45.787 --> 00:54:47.523
This is a crap ambush point, by the way.

00:54:47.524 --> 00:54:48.357
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:54:48.358 --> 00:54:50.906
SAM: Not this hallway, the big one
that we just came from.

00:54:50.907 --> 00:54:51.800
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:54:51.801 --> 00:54:53.336
We should at least
get out of this room

00:54:53.337 --> 00:54:56.097
while the the brown mold's
doing its thing.

00:54:56.098 --> 00:54:57.986
LAURA: This is a really
bad ambush place?

00:54:57.987 --> 00:54:59.016
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:54:59.017 --> 00:54:59.937
LAURA: Why?

00:54:59.938 --> 00:55:02.056
TRAVIS: Because it's a crossfire.

00:55:02.057 --> 00:55:03.516
LAURA: Oh.

00:55:03.517 --> 00:55:04.715
Okay.

00:55:04.716 --> 00:55:06.648
MARISHA: ♪ You'll get
caught up in the-- ♪

00:55:06.649 --> 00:55:07.906
MATT: ♪ Crossfire ♪

00:55:07.907 --> 00:55:08.940
All righty.

00:55:10.254 --> 00:55:13.098
SAM: ♪ You'll get caught up in the ♪

00:55:13.099 --> 00:55:13.999
MARISHA: Okay.

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.136
But there is another
big chamber that we moved out of.

00:55:16.137 --> 00:55:17.746
We're like-- this is
just the hall chamber.

00:55:17.747 --> 00:55:18.821
MATT: Correct.

00:55:18.822 --> 00:55:21.956
A number of minutes back that way

00:55:21.957 --> 00:55:24.346
is the large chamber
you guys had dropped into

00:55:24.347 --> 00:55:25.861
with the fallen tower, and--

00:55:25.862 --> 00:55:26.857
LIAM: That's where we had talked about--

00:55:26.857 --> 00:55:27.777
MATT: That's where you were discussing--

00:55:27.778 --> 00:55:29.446
LIAM: -- setting a sigil, land in.

00:55:29.447 --> 00:55:30.280
MARISHA: Right.

00:55:32.819 --> 00:55:34.006
TALIESIN: In my opinion,
we set the sigil

00:55:34.007 --> 00:55:36.696
and keep moving down to
see what this place is.

00:55:36.697 --> 00:55:38.615
We end up chasing them,
I don't want to be surprised.

00:55:38.616 --> 00:55:39.836
MARISHA: The sigil's the one--

00:55:39.837 --> 00:55:41.646
Jester said sigil's the one that we want

00:55:41.647 --> 00:55:43.026
to make sure we're there for.

00:55:43.027 --> 00:55:46.686
We could set the intuit charges
if we feel like

00:55:46.687 --> 00:55:49.716
we can continue to set
traps along the way.

00:55:49.717 --> 00:55:52.276
I feel like it almost starts
with intuit charges--

00:55:52.277 --> 00:55:53.700
Intuit? Inuit.

00:55:53.701 --> 00:55:55.284
MATT: No, intuit.
MARISHA: Intuit.

00:55:55.285 --> 00:55:57.276
LIAM: Not Inuit.
MARISHA: Definitely not that.

00:55:57.277 --> 00:55:58.110
Yeah, okay.

00:55:58.111 --> 00:56:01.710
Intuit charges, and then ending with,

00:56:02.957 --> 00:56:06.926
you know, the big thing that you have.

00:56:06.927 --> 00:56:08.877
I'm distracted now.
LAURA: Symbol.

00:56:08.878 --> 00:56:09.711
MARISHA: Symbol.

00:56:09.711 --> 00:56:10.695
MATT: (like Rafiki) Symbol.

00:56:10.696 --> 00:56:13.362
(laughter)

00:56:14.517 --> 00:56:15.459
TALIESIN: Reminded me of a thing.

00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:18.956
TRAVIS: Member of indigenous people of Northern
Canada, parts of Greenland, and Alaska. Yeah.

00:56:20.383 --> 00:56:21.561
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:56:21.562 --> 00:56:22.395
Yeah. (laughing)

00:56:22.396 --> 00:56:24.536
TRAVIS: I was pretty sure I knew it.

00:56:24.537 --> 00:56:25.370
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:56:28.537 --> 00:56:29.756
LAURA: Okay, so what do we do?

00:56:29.757 --> 00:56:31.860
We keep moving forward, or?

00:56:33.437 --> 00:56:36.256
And the brown mold is on its
way here. It's coming in.

00:56:36.257 --> 00:56:37.626
TALIESIN: Unless someone's got some ice.

00:56:37.627 --> 00:56:39.676
LIAM: For clarity, which
direction is the brown mold

00:56:39.677 --> 00:56:41.486
bleeding in from, from
where we came or from--

00:56:41.487 --> 00:56:43.636
MATT: No, the brown mold
was what he saw

00:56:43.637 --> 00:56:46.301
was actually piped up
in the corners here,

00:56:46.302 --> 00:56:49.476
and it just expanded to swoop into

00:56:49.477 --> 00:56:51.106
where the fire was.

00:56:51.107 --> 00:56:54.256
As you step back, it doesn't follow you,

00:56:54.257 --> 00:56:57.696
it just goes to where the
heat is of the flames.

00:56:57.697 --> 00:57:01.066
Now you've walked through
a decent, like, you know,

00:57:01.067 --> 00:57:04.386
beyond 10 feet from brown mold
and it didn't pursue

00:57:04.387 --> 00:57:05.948
or didn't do any damage to you.

00:57:05.949 --> 00:57:06.782
LAURA: Okay.

00:57:06.783 --> 00:57:08.466
MATT: That was what Essek
had burned that path

00:57:08.467 --> 00:57:10.066
into the initial chamber.

00:57:10.067 --> 00:57:12.466
And only when that flame happened

00:57:12.467 --> 00:57:14.366
did it actually
move to encompass it.

00:57:14.367 --> 00:57:16.366
So you gather, based on
the two interactions,

00:57:16.367 --> 00:57:20.036
that body heat doesn't cause it to move,

00:57:20.037 --> 00:57:22.496
it just causes it, if you get too close,

00:57:22.497 --> 00:57:24.786
to try and absorb your heat.

00:57:24.787 --> 00:57:26.856
It's open flame, extreme heat,

00:57:26.857 --> 00:57:29.702
that causes it to actually
expand towards it.

00:57:29.703 --> 00:57:30.536
TALIESIN: Ooh.

00:57:30.537 --> 00:57:31.996
LAURA: Okay, so we can just
back away from the fire

00:57:31.997 --> 00:57:32.877
and we'll be okay.

00:57:32.878 --> 00:57:34.026
SAM: Yeah.

00:57:34.027 --> 00:57:37.096
MATT: The fire is out now,
and the brown mold

00:57:37.097 --> 00:57:39.596
has expanded beneath and over the body,

00:57:39.597 --> 00:57:42.886
and you can see now it just looks like

00:57:42.887 --> 00:57:45.076
an awful moss man figure.

00:57:45.077 --> 00:57:47.660
It's just covered in dark fuzz.

00:57:48.889 --> 00:57:49.880
LAURA: All right.

00:57:50.877 --> 00:57:52.666
TRAVIS: Shall we see what's beyond this?

00:57:52.667 --> 00:57:54.806
SAM: I guess.

00:57:54.807 --> 00:57:56.226
TRAVIS: We'll just get a look,
and then if we're like,

00:57:56.227 --> 00:57:58.136
whoa, now it's getting real complicated,

00:57:58.137 --> 00:57:59.258
we can set the booby and keep moving.

00:57:59.259 --> 00:58:00.391
SAM: Okay, okay.

00:58:00.392 --> 00:58:03.358
LAURA: We can set the booby. Let's do it.

00:58:04.687 --> 00:58:05.885
SAM: Okay.
ASHLEY: I like that idea.

00:58:05.886 --> 00:58:08.058
LAURA: So we're going to
walk forward through the

00:58:08.059 --> 00:58:09.886
non-deady-endy hallway.

00:58:09.887 --> 00:58:10.757
MATT: All righty.

00:58:10.758 --> 00:58:12.056
LIAM: Once the group
clears out of the way,

00:58:12.057 --> 00:58:15.406
Capeleb's going to grab
the mate by the tail

00:58:15.407 --> 00:58:18.511
and drag it and shove it
in with its dead partner.

00:58:18.512 --> 00:58:19.512
MARISHA: That's a good idea.

00:58:19.513 --> 00:58:21.736
LIAM: In the side portion.
MATT: Okay, good call.

00:58:21.737 --> 00:58:23.596
LIAM: And as legs keep
spilling back out.

00:58:23.597 --> 00:58:25.289
He's like (grunts).

00:58:25.290 --> 00:58:27.881
(laughter)

00:58:27.882 --> 00:58:30.643
(groaning)

00:58:30.644 --> 00:58:31.856
TRAVIS: (groaning)

00:58:31.857 --> 00:58:32.930
ASHLEY: Stay in there.

00:58:32.931 --> 00:58:34.376
LIAM: Caleb, Caleb, Caleb!

00:58:34.377 --> 00:58:35.584
ASHLEY: He's good. He's in there.

00:58:35.585 --> 00:58:36.635
TALIESIN: Go to sleep.

00:58:38.177 --> 00:58:39.010
MATT: All righty.

00:58:39.011 --> 00:58:40.756
Could I have a marching order

00:58:40.757 --> 00:58:43.050
as you all continue onward?

00:58:44.605 --> 00:58:48.406
TRAVIS: Can we see brown mold
on our path ahead of us?

00:58:48.407 --> 00:58:51.226
Do we need Essek to--

00:58:51.227 --> 00:58:53.487
LAURA: Or just avoid it in 10-foot--

00:58:55.497 --> 00:58:57.303
MATT: He himself has gathered
his breath and goes,

00:58:57.304 --> 00:59:00.966
"I am willing to carve anything we see,

00:59:00.967 --> 00:59:02.796
"just point it out to me.

00:59:02.797 --> 00:59:03.777
"I have it at my disposal.

00:59:03.778 --> 00:59:06.886
"This is a very rudimentary--"

00:59:06.887 --> 00:59:09.098
SAM: You can say "cantrip,"
we understand magic.

00:59:09.099 --> 00:59:10.158
LAURA: Yeah.

00:59:10.159 --> 00:59:10.992
MATT: "Cantrip."

00:59:14.231 --> 00:59:17.544
LIAM: Capeleb walks over and palms
Essek's almost entire torso.

00:59:17.545 --> 00:59:18.378
(grunts)

00:59:18.379 --> 00:59:20.056
MATT: "(startled) Ah."

00:59:20.057 --> 00:59:21.247
LAURA: Oh, Caleb--

00:59:21.248 --> 00:59:22.234
MATT: "(startled groaning)"

00:59:22.235 --> 00:59:23.719
LIAM: He looks over at Caduceus.

00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:24.553
(grunts)

00:59:24.553 --> 00:59:25.480
MATT: "Whoa.

00:59:25.481 --> 00:59:27.596
"(shouting)"

00:59:27.597 --> 00:59:29.236
TALIESIN: I'm aware,
I'm just waiting for a moment

00:59:29.237 --> 00:59:30.816
where you're back to normal.

00:59:30.817 --> 00:59:32.918
It's just easier for me to do everybody.

00:59:32.919 --> 00:59:34.406
MATT: "If you don't--"

00:59:34.407 --> 00:59:36.364
LIAM: Holds out to Jester. (grunting)

00:59:36.365 --> 00:59:37.890
LAURA: Yes, I understand.

00:59:38.857 --> 00:59:39.981
Put him down, Caleb.

00:59:39.982 --> 00:59:41.328
MATT: Pats the finger, goes like,

00:59:41.329 --> 00:59:42.987
"You can put me down, Caleb, please.

00:59:43.845 --> 00:59:44.697
"(grunts)"

00:59:44.698 --> 00:59:45.719
TALIESIN: Well, that works, too.

00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:48.076
MATT: He's like clutching. "(moaning)"

00:59:48.077 --> 00:59:50.679
LAURA: He doesn't think
clearly when he's an animal.

00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:52.956
MATT: "Evidently!"

00:59:52.957 --> 00:59:55.265
MARISHA: You look really
cool up there, though.

00:59:55.266 --> 00:59:57.222
MATT: "Thanks?"
MARISHA: Yeah, it's a good look.

00:59:57.223 --> 00:59:59.246
TRAVIS: -- giant ape, this is great.
LAURA: Yeah.

00:59:59.247 --> 01:00:01.286
TALIESIN: Once we're somewhere else
where we can take 10 minutes,

01:00:01.287 --> 01:00:03.053
you can finally do that
and I can finally do

01:00:03.054 --> 01:00:05.426
what I need to do to
bring everybody up.

01:00:05.427 --> 01:00:06.496
MATT: All right.
TALIESIN: Whoever needs it.

01:00:06.497 --> 01:00:07.706
MATT: What's the marching order?

01:00:07.707 --> 01:00:10.696
There's about a 25-plus space here.

01:00:10.697 --> 01:00:12.536
So you can go as a group if you want to,

01:00:12.537 --> 01:00:14.266
or you can go in any sort of line

01:00:14.267 --> 01:00:16.142
up to like four in a row,
if you want to, your call.

01:00:16.143 --> 01:00:18.216
LAURA: I mean, I could try
to take another 10 minutes

01:00:18.217 --> 01:00:20.126
and do it right now.
MATT: You can.

01:00:20.127 --> 01:00:21.496
LAURA: In the little alcove over there.

01:00:21.497 --> 01:00:23.471
SAM: Try Commune to ask
some questions, is that right?

01:00:23.472 --> 01:00:24.546
LAURA: Yeah.

01:00:24.547 --> 01:00:25.846
SAM: Sure.

01:00:25.847 --> 01:00:28.716
LAURA: One of them was--

01:00:28.717 --> 01:00:30.136
SAM: Oh yeah, they were good, too.

01:00:30.137 --> 01:00:31.137
LAURA: Yeah, they were.

01:00:31.138 --> 01:00:33.546
Is there another doorway
in the courtyard?

01:00:33.547 --> 01:00:34.380
MARISHA: Right.

01:00:34.381 --> 01:00:36.836
LAURA: That leads to the Somnovem.

01:00:36.837 --> 01:00:37.670
MARISHA: Right.

01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:38.628
TALIESIN: Have they beaten
us here, I think was--

01:00:38.629 --> 01:00:40.506
LAURA: Have they already gotten here?

01:00:40.507 --> 01:00:42.814
MARISHA: And where they are,
right? Or if they're behind.

01:00:42.815 --> 01:00:45.186
LAURA: I can't ask that,
because it has to be yes or no.

01:00:45.187 --> 01:00:46.406
Have they already gotten here?

01:00:46.407 --> 01:00:50.386
And, depending on the answer
to the first question,

01:00:50.387 --> 01:00:52.483
is the Somnovem Ward straight ahead?

01:00:52.484 --> 01:00:54.666
TRAVIS: Are they within 12 hours of us?

01:00:54.667 --> 01:00:55.889
LAURA: Ooh.
MARISHA: That's a good one.

01:00:55.890 --> 01:00:58.304
LAURA: Okay, well that could be
the second, the other followup.

01:00:58.305 --> 01:00:59.546
TRAVIS: 24 hours.

01:00:59.547 --> 01:01:02.090
SAM: That could be in
front or behind us, though.

01:01:03.597 --> 01:01:05.026
TRAVIS: True.

01:01:05.027 --> 01:01:06.486
SAM: That doesn't help.

01:01:06.487 --> 01:01:07.320
LAURA: Hmm.

01:01:08.157 --> 01:01:09.686
TRAVIS: If they're no
in front of us, though.

01:01:09.687 --> 01:01:13.106
LAURA: I could also ask
if Ikithon is within--

01:01:13.107 --> 01:01:15.846
is following us here
too, if he's close by.

01:01:15.847 --> 01:01:17.102
SAM: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

01:01:17.103 --> 01:01:19.479
TALIESIN: Good questions.
SAM: You want to do your--

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:20.357
LAURA: I mean, I can try.

01:01:20.358 --> 01:01:22.096
Should we all like, bunker down

01:01:22.097 --> 01:01:23.356
in this little alcove on the other side

01:01:23.357 --> 01:01:24.946
away from the--
SAM: Sure.

01:01:24.947 --> 01:01:26.371
LAURA: -- moldies?
You were on that side,

01:01:26.372 --> 01:01:28.429
there was no mold there.
TRAVIS: We could go into the other room,

01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:31.248
someone stands guard with
you while you set up,

01:01:31.249 --> 01:01:32.896
and then we can still
explore at the same time,

01:01:32.897 --> 01:01:34.276
since it takes 10 minutes.

01:01:34.277 --> 01:01:35.466
SAM: That's fair.
LAURA: Sure.

01:01:35.467 --> 01:01:37.756
I just am afraid there's
going to be another giant monster

01:01:37.757 --> 01:01:39.233
once we walk down this
hallway, but sure.

01:01:39.234 --> 01:01:41.266
SAM: Someone will stay--
LAURA: Okay, yeah.

01:01:41.267 --> 01:01:42.100
You want to stay?

01:01:42.101 --> 01:01:44.856
All right, let's chill and they walk.

01:01:44.857 --> 01:01:45.757
TRAVIS: We move forward.

01:01:45.758 --> 01:01:48.146
MATT: All right, who's moving forward?

01:01:48.147 --> 01:01:50.180
TRAVIS: I think we're
following Grape Ape.

01:01:51.687 --> 01:01:53.686
SAM: But some people are
staying behind with Jester?

01:01:53.687 --> 01:01:54.911
LIAM: Yeah, you two are staying behind?

01:01:54.912 --> 01:01:56.306
TRAVIS: We're all going
into the next space.

01:01:56.307 --> 01:01:57.846
LIAM: Oh, I thought Jester
was talking about

01:01:57.847 --> 01:01:59.713
doing it right here.
LAURA: Yeah, I was saying--

01:01:59.714 --> 01:02:01.356
TRAVIS: Oh, sure, either one.

01:02:01.357 --> 01:02:02.686
LAURA: Yeah, that's what I was saying.

01:02:02.687 --> 01:02:03.520
MARISHA: Let's just wait 10 minutes.

01:02:03.521 --> 01:02:05.046
Anytime we wander off in the middle--

01:02:05.047 --> 01:02:05.960
TALIESIN: Let's wait 10 minutes,
because then

01:02:05.961 --> 01:02:07.056
I can also heal some people.

01:02:07.057 --> 01:02:09.486
LIAM: Yeah, it didn't go
so well on the fire plane.

01:02:09.487 --> 01:02:10.387
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:02:10.388 --> 01:02:12.939
LIAM: Just an extra
three minutes on the fire plane

01:02:12.940 --> 01:02:14.405
would've made a world of difference.
LAURA: It's so fast,

01:02:14.406 --> 01:02:15.664
I'm just going to do the ritual,

01:02:15.665 --> 01:02:17.036
and da-da-da, 10 minutes go by.

01:02:17.037 --> 01:02:19.216
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to
heal a bunch of people, too.

01:02:19.217 --> 01:02:20.384
ASHLEY: Da-da-da-da.

01:02:21.434 --> 01:02:23.256
TALIESIN: Who needs healing really badly?

01:02:23.257 --> 01:02:25.931
MATT: "If you do not mind." (chuckles)

01:02:25.932 --> 01:02:27.026
SAM: I wouldn't say no, but--

01:02:27.027 --> 01:02:28.766
LAURA: I mean, I could
use some, if you want to

01:02:28.767 --> 01:02:31.086
throw it on me while I'm--

01:02:31.087 --> 01:02:32.007
TRAVIS: I need some.

01:02:32.008 --> 01:02:34.487
TALIESIN: Four, one, two, three, four--

01:02:34.488 --> 01:02:35.566
SAM: And Essek?

01:02:35.567 --> 01:02:36.756
TALIESIN: Five, Essek's in there.

01:02:36.757 --> 01:02:37.590
MATT: "Mm-hmm."

01:02:37.591 --> 01:02:39.216
TALIESIN: Well, I'll wait
for you and I'll do you

01:02:39.217 --> 01:02:41.321
special later, because you've got--

01:02:41.322 --> 01:02:42.177
ASHLEY: Oh, wow.

01:02:42.178 --> 01:02:44.436
TALIESIN: And I'll get myself,
so okay, that's one, two, three,

01:02:44.437 --> 01:02:47.746
four, five, six,
so you're fine, I assume.

01:02:47.747 --> 01:02:48.580
Or--

01:02:48.581 --> 01:02:51.474
ASHLEY: I mean, technically,
I could be okay.

01:02:51.475 --> 01:02:52.308
TALIESIN: Okay.

01:02:52.309 --> 01:02:53.846
We'll work on you too later.

01:02:53.847 --> 01:02:55.346
Okay, so everyone takes--

01:02:55.347 --> 01:02:56.804
LIAM: If we take a short rest,
I'll drop it now.

01:02:56.805 --> 01:02:58.136
LAURA: That takes an hour.
LIAM: I know, I know.

01:02:58.137 --> 01:02:59.396
TALIESIN: That's pretty good.

01:02:59.397 --> 01:03:00.230
LIAM: If we did, I would.
LAURA: Right.

01:03:00.231 --> 01:03:01.686
LIAM: Because I can't
use any magic right now.

01:03:01.687 --> 01:03:03.336
I'm just a big dummy.
LAURA: Right.

01:03:03.337 --> 01:03:06.496
TALIESIN: That's 23 points to--
I rolled real well.

01:03:06.497 --> 01:03:07.696
To--
TRAVIS: Thank you.

01:03:07.697 --> 01:03:09.146
LIAM: Still smarter than Grog.

01:03:09.147 --> 01:03:11.006
TALIESIN: Everyone--

01:03:11.007 --> 01:03:13.331
MATT: "Much appreciated, Mr. Clay."

01:03:13.332 --> 01:03:14.165
TALIESIN: Any time.

01:03:14.166 --> 01:03:17.053
Just trying to pick
everybody up a little.

01:03:17.054 --> 01:03:18.519
SAM: Thank you, Mr. Clay.

01:03:20.337 --> 01:03:21.725
TALIESIN: In this together.

01:03:22.767 --> 01:03:23.999
MATT: All right. And you're Communing

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.020
and who's keeping watch?

01:03:26.021 --> 01:03:27.226
ASHLEY: I can keep watch.

01:03:27.227 --> 01:03:30.066
MATT: Okay, well whoever
wants to roll for perception,

01:03:30.067 --> 01:03:31.856
go for it.
TALIESIN: I can't because I'm casting.

01:03:31.857 --> 01:03:33.474
MATT: Well, it's over a 10-minute period.
TALIESIN: Oh.

01:03:33.475 --> 01:03:34.871
MATT: How long is your casting for that?
TALIESIN: 10 minute.

01:03:34.872 --> 01:03:36.212
MATT: Oh yeah, so you're casting,
so you can't.

01:03:36.213 --> 01:03:37.523
So somebody else has to.

01:03:37.524 --> 01:03:38.646
TRAVIS: Beau, you want to?

01:03:38.647 --> 01:03:39.676
Does your perception suck?

01:03:39.677 --> 01:03:41.376
MARISHA: It's not great, but I can.

01:03:41.377 --> 01:03:43.476
I'll assist you.
TRAVIS: Great.

01:03:43.477 --> 01:03:45.016
SAM: Yasha said she was going--

01:03:45.017 --> 01:03:46.033
MARISHA: Oh, Yasha--

01:03:46.034 --> 01:03:47.356
MATT: Well then, Yasha,
you go, and then you go.

01:03:47.357 --> 01:03:48.613
ASHLEY: No, you just rolled.

01:03:48.614 --> 01:03:50.587
MATT: He rolled once.
TRAVIS: I rolled once.

01:03:50.588 --> 01:03:52.030
ASHLEY: And then I roll once.
MATT: Yeah.

01:03:53.317 --> 01:03:55.203
ASHLEY: Hopefully you
did better than I did.

01:03:55.204 --> 01:03:57.358
TRAVIS: 16.
ASHLEY: Yeah, 16 for me, too.

01:03:57.359 --> 01:03:58.956
MATT: Oh.

01:03:58.957 --> 01:03:59.790
All right.

01:03:59.791 --> 01:04:02.396
As two of your compatriots are finishing

01:04:02.397 --> 01:04:07.397
their short-term rituals,
glancing around the space,

01:04:07.417 --> 01:04:11.957
you can hear that very faint
sound of the brown mold--

01:04:13.257 --> 01:04:14.286
shifting.

01:04:14.287 --> 01:04:17.336
You glance over. It's not
moving closer or expanding.

01:04:17.337 --> 01:04:21.246
It's just continuing its
covering of the body,

01:04:21.247 --> 01:04:23.153
including the one you threw over there.

01:04:23.154 --> 01:04:24.262
LAURA: That's great.

01:04:25.447 --> 01:04:26.642
But it stays put.

01:04:27.747 --> 01:04:30.646
You don't hear anything else.

01:04:30.647 --> 01:04:33.656
You feel pretty
comfortable and confident

01:04:33.657 --> 01:04:36.752
that at the moment, things are still.

01:04:39.357 --> 01:04:41.286
You are attempting a--

01:04:41.287 --> 01:04:42.616
LAURA: Commune.
MATT: Commune.

01:04:42.617 --> 01:04:43.450
All righty.

01:04:44.427 --> 01:04:46.656
So as you finish your ritual,
you sit there quietly

01:04:46.657 --> 01:04:47.966
with your eyes closed, and once again,

01:04:47.967 --> 01:04:49.907
hear the gentle voice in your ear.

01:04:50.767 --> 01:04:51.600
Left ear.

01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:54.405
(as the Traveler) "Yes, my dear."

01:04:54.406 --> 01:04:56.870
LAURA: (gasps) I'm so glad you're here!

01:04:57.877 --> 01:04:58.966
Okay, I have some questions for you.

01:04:58.967 --> 01:05:01.816
If you can just take a little
gander around, all right?

01:05:01.817 --> 01:05:03.226
MATT: "I'll do my best."

01:05:03.227 --> 01:05:04.716
LAURA: Can you float into the courtyard

01:05:04.717 --> 01:05:07.526
and see if there's any other entryways

01:05:07.527 --> 01:05:10.236
that we missed back there
that could potentially

01:05:10.237 --> 01:05:11.070
lead to the Somnovem?

01:05:11.071 --> 01:05:12.846
Or that do lead to the Somnovem Ward,

01:05:12.847 --> 01:05:14.465
because you know, you're all-knowing.

01:05:14.466 --> 01:05:16.366
MATT: "I'm confused as
to what you're asking.

01:05:16.367 --> 01:05:17.200
"What is your question?"

01:05:17.201 --> 01:05:18.496
LAURA: Back in the courtyard?

01:05:18.497 --> 01:05:21.036
You know, the icy room with
all of the black, the brown--

01:05:21.037 --> 01:05:22.326
MATT: "Right, yes, yes."

01:05:22.327 --> 01:05:25.036
LAURA: Were there any other,
like, hallways, entrances

01:05:25.037 --> 01:05:27.736
that we missed that led
to the Somnovem Ward?

01:05:27.737 --> 01:05:28.570
MATT: "In that chamber?

01:05:28.571 --> 01:05:32.286
"No, that seemed pretty standard
fare of one way to go."

01:05:32.287 --> 01:05:33.499
LAURA: Okay, okay, that's good.

01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:35.329
Because we didn't explore it completely.

01:05:35.330 --> 01:05:36.562
MATT: "No, no, of course not."

01:05:36.563 --> 01:05:37.396
LAURA: Okay.

01:05:37.397 --> 01:05:38.716
I have a second question for you.

01:05:38.717 --> 01:05:40.666
MATT: "Mm-hmm."

01:05:40.667 --> 01:05:42.010
LAURA: The Tomb Takers.

01:05:43.347 --> 01:05:45.675
MATT: "Oh yes, those strange folk, go on."

01:05:48.477 --> 01:05:49.777
LAURA: Are they--

01:05:54.107 --> 01:05:56.685
Less than a day behind us?

01:06:02.627 --> 01:06:04.176
MATT: "Seems about right, yeah."

01:06:04.177 --> 01:06:05.634
LAURA: (quietly) Fuck.

01:06:05.635 --> 01:06:07.416
SAM: Less than a day.

01:06:07.417 --> 01:06:08.486
Could mean one minute.

01:06:08.487 --> 01:06:09.689
MARISHA: Way to combo that question.

01:06:09.690 --> 01:06:11.626
That was good.

01:06:11.627 --> 01:06:12.876
Yeah, it was good.

01:06:12.877 --> 01:06:15.536
MATT: "They are eager beavers, them."

01:06:15.537 --> 01:06:16.992
LAURA: They suck.

01:06:16.993 --> 01:06:18.246
MATT: "(chuckles)"

01:06:18.247 --> 01:06:20.489
LAURA: And we're doing
all the killing for them.

01:06:23.827 --> 01:06:25.436
Last question.

01:06:25.437 --> 01:06:27.199
What do you think?
This is not a question for you.

01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:28.596
This is a question for them.

01:06:28.597 --> 01:06:29.822
MATT: "I'll just wait."

01:06:29.823 --> 01:06:31.830
You can just hear the
voice in your ear again.

01:06:32.867 --> 01:06:35.726
LAURA: Should I ask him about Ikithon?

01:06:35.727 --> 01:06:39.706
Or should I ask him about, like,

01:06:39.707 --> 01:06:43.033
how far deeper is the
Somnovem Ward sort of shit?

01:06:43.034 --> 01:06:44.333
TRAVIS: That's not a yes or no.

01:06:44.334 --> 01:06:46.978
LAURA: Yeah, I could try to
frame it like yes or no, though.

01:06:46.979 --> 01:06:47.857
TALIESIN: I think Ikithon's the way--

01:06:47.858 --> 01:06:49.516
I think we're going to hit
where we're going to hit

01:06:49.517 --> 01:06:51.747
and knowing that we're,
you know, we're moving.

01:06:51.748 --> 01:06:52.883
LIAM: (grunts)

01:06:52.884 --> 01:06:53.903
LAURA: Ikithon?

01:06:53.904 --> 01:06:56.176
LIAM: (grunts)
(grunting)

01:06:56.177 --> 01:06:57.542
He's an ape.

01:06:57.543 --> 01:06:58.781
(laughter)

01:06:58.782 --> 01:07:00.082
MATT: "Apparently."

01:07:02.017 --> 01:07:02.850
TRAVIS: You.

01:07:02.851 --> 01:07:05.610
MATT: Make a
perception check. (laughing)

01:07:07.127 --> 01:07:07.960
LIAM: 21.

01:07:09.287 --> 01:07:10.120
MATT: 21.

01:07:13.307 --> 01:07:16.006
Oh man, it's hard to do whispers here.

01:07:16.007 --> 01:07:16.999
SAM: Text it.

01:07:17.912 --> 01:07:19.223
LAURA and MATT: (laugh)

01:07:19.224 --> 01:07:20.616
MATT: I'm doing that.

01:07:20.617 --> 01:07:23.268
SAM: Text it, but use
Siri to dictate it.

01:07:23.269 --> 01:07:26.036
(laughter)

01:07:26.037 --> 01:07:28.805
LIAM: Did I spot giant banana?

01:07:28.806 --> 01:07:29.897
Yes or no?

01:07:31.406 --> 01:07:32.629
TRAVIS: Brendan Fraser.

01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:33.630
MATT: All right.

01:07:38.787 --> 01:07:40.703
LAURA: How should I phrase this?

01:07:41.839 --> 01:07:45.036
Ikithon is following us, yeah?

01:07:45.037 --> 01:07:48.087
So is he...

01:07:50.077 --> 01:07:51.712
also...

01:07:53.257 --> 01:07:55.183
(squeaking)

01:07:55.184 --> 01:07:56.636
(laughter)

01:07:56.637 --> 01:07:57.726
MATT: "I'm sorry, I didn't get that.

01:07:57.727 --> 01:07:59.093
"What was the question?"

01:07:59.094 --> 01:08:00.749
TALIESIN: You mumbled your question.

01:08:00.750 --> 01:08:02.541
(laughter)

01:08:02.542 --> 01:08:04.096
LAURA: You know how when
you had an essay due

01:08:04.097 --> 01:08:05.316
and you didn't know
how to spell something,

01:08:05.317 --> 01:08:06.806
so you'd write in
cursive sloppily

01:08:06.807 --> 01:08:08.851
and hope that they thought
that you knew how to spell it?

01:08:08.852 --> 01:08:10.779
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Nope.

01:08:10.780 --> 01:08:12.171
SAM: Nope, not at all.

01:08:12.172 --> 01:08:13.005
LAURA: Oh.

01:08:13.006 --> 01:08:14.660
TRAVIS: That's smart, though.

01:08:14.661 --> 01:08:16.666
Everything else is in
plain text except for--

01:08:16.667 --> 01:08:17.942
LAURA: La-la-la-la.

01:08:19.067 --> 01:08:21.086
LAURA: Trent Ikithon and crew.

01:08:21.087 --> 01:08:22.027
MATT: "Mm-hmm."

01:08:22.028 --> 01:08:23.687
LAURA: Are they...

01:08:24.927 --> 01:08:29.111
like, going to catch up
to the Tomb Takers and us

01:08:29.112 --> 01:08:33.536
in the next 24 hours or so?

01:08:33.537 --> 01:08:35.112
That's a terrible question.

01:08:37.355 --> 01:08:38.545
MATT: "Um..."

01:08:38.546 --> 01:08:39.870
(laughter)

01:08:39.871 --> 01:08:41.444
LAURA: What do you think,
what do you think?

01:08:41.445 --> 01:08:43.826
I mean, you can see them, I'm sure.

01:08:43.827 --> 01:08:45.844
Wherever they are.

01:08:45.845 --> 01:08:47.566
MATT: "What, do you think
I'm a god or something?"

01:08:47.567 --> 01:08:50.376
LAURA: Well, you have so many powers.

01:08:50.377 --> 01:08:51.730
Like, I know you can play around--

01:08:51.731 --> 01:08:55.516
MATT: "I do, you're not
wrong, but-- (sighs)

01:08:55.517 --> 01:08:57.857
"Pieces are moving at
different speeds, my darling.

01:08:57.858 --> 01:08:58.908
"It's, um...

01:08:59.769 --> 01:09:02.416
"I mean, they certainly
seem intent on you,

01:09:02.417 --> 01:09:05.489
"but I don't see them
quite hot on your heels."

01:09:05.490 --> 01:09:06.746
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:09:06.747 --> 01:09:09.746
Well, that's good to know too, okay.

01:09:09.747 --> 01:09:10.580
Cool.

01:09:11.977 --> 01:09:13.225
Do you want to hang out
with us for a while?

01:09:13.226 --> 01:09:14.059
We're just going to be--

01:09:14.060 --> 01:09:15.766
MATT: "No, I'll just keep
an eye from a distance."

01:09:15.767 --> 01:09:18.116
You just keep hearing
the voice whispering.

01:09:18.117 --> 01:09:19.546
As it does.

01:09:19.547 --> 01:09:20.380
LAURA: All right.

01:09:20.381 --> 01:09:23.706
Feel free to save us
if we all start to die.

01:09:23.707 --> 01:09:25.396
MATT: "I will, don't worry."

01:09:25.397 --> 01:09:26.676
LAURA: Okay.

01:09:26.677 --> 01:09:28.476
We're fine, you guys, we're safe.

01:09:28.477 --> 01:09:30.008
Artie's got our back.

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:34.189
SAM: So they're almost here.

01:09:34.190 --> 01:09:36.249
LAURA: He said they were within a day.

01:09:36.250 --> 01:09:37.200
SAM: Which could mean--

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:38.100
LAURA: It could mean, like,

01:09:38.101 --> 01:09:39.148
two hours from now.
SAM: Moments.

01:09:39.149 --> 01:09:41.937
LAURA: It could mean, you know,
it could mean

01:09:41.938 --> 01:09:43.529
if we went to sleep
right now, we could all

01:09:43.530 --> 01:09:44.746
get a full night's rest.

01:09:44.747 --> 01:09:45.889
SAM: Should we radio the guards?

01:09:45.890 --> 01:09:47.009
Just make sure they answer.

01:09:47.010 --> 01:09:48.759
What if they're all dead?
TRAVIS: Sure.

01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:50.425
MARISHA: That's a good idea.
ASHLEY: That is a good idea.

01:09:50.426 --> 01:09:52.199
SAM: Oh, Essek has the stone, right?

01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:53.720
MATT: He pulls the stone out.

01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:57.489
"This is Shadowhand.
I am inquiring as to--"

01:09:57.490 --> 01:09:58.323
TRAVIS: Ooh!

01:09:58.324 --> 01:10:00.019
MATT: "The exterior perimeter."
SAM: Shadowhand to Woodchuck.

01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:02.319
Shadowhand to Woodchuck.
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:03.319
TRAVIS: Woodchuck.

01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:06.969
MATT: "They haven't seen anything yet.

01:10:06.970 --> 01:10:08.529
"They are keeping a very close watch,

01:10:08.530 --> 01:10:11.089
"but it seems to be
clear at the moment."

01:10:11.090 --> 01:10:12.597
TRAVIS: Should've given
them a code word.

01:10:12.598 --> 01:10:14.422
That's not the rangers.

01:10:14.423 --> 01:10:15.516
SAM: Mmm.

01:10:15.517 --> 01:10:16.599
LAURA: Ooh.

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:18.555
SAM: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

01:10:19.571 --> 01:10:21.226
MATT: "I don't think it's that deep."

01:10:21.227 --> 01:10:23.122
TRAVIS: (laughs)

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:24.913
LAURA: All right.

01:10:24.914 --> 01:10:26.018
TALIESIN: Keep heading down.

01:10:26.019 --> 01:10:28.030
LAURA: I guess so.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:10:28.031 --> 01:10:30.161
TRAVIS: Want to set the booby,
you want to keep heading down?

01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:33.059
TALIESIN: Say let's set the booby,
then keep heading down.

01:10:33.060 --> 01:10:34.611
ASHLEY: How many boobies do we have?

01:10:34.612 --> 01:10:37.329
TALIESIN: Just one.
LAURA: Just the one booby.

01:10:37.330 --> 01:10:39.509
SAM: Oh, we found out that
we just have one booby?

01:10:39.510 --> 01:10:41.419
I thought it was two?
TRAVIS: Well, Jester has one--

01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:42.789
LAURA: I have one booby.

01:10:42.790 --> 01:10:44.330
TRAVIS: -- thing, one charge.
SAM: Don't we have,

01:10:44.331 --> 01:10:47.029
as a group, we have more
than one booby, right?

01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:48.976
LAURA: Yes, but--
TRAVIS: There are three or four here.

01:10:48.977 --> 01:10:50.717
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: If you set off one booby,

01:10:50.718 --> 01:10:52.042
though, correct me if I'm wrong.

01:10:52.043 --> 01:10:53.969
I'm an ape, this is Liam talking.

01:10:53.970 --> 01:10:56.039
One booby could potentially knock out,

01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:58.879
you know, like a hunk of
somebody's total hit points.

01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:01.634
But if it's the only booby going off,

01:11:01.635 --> 01:11:03.800
then they'll just use
some hit dice and refill.

01:11:03.801 --> 01:11:05.009
Wouldn't you want to chain them so

01:11:05.010 --> 01:11:09.459
that they could potentially
max out over their totals?

01:11:09.460 --> 01:11:12.289
LAURA: Yeah, I think all of the
boobies in the same area

01:11:12.290 --> 01:11:15.829
is the best plan, rather than
little by little.

01:11:15.830 --> 01:11:17.237
MARISHA: So is that all of the boobies,

01:11:17.238 --> 01:11:19.895
including us ambushing?

01:11:19.896 --> 01:11:21.689
LAURA: Yes, I think so.
MARISHA: Boobs then ambush?

01:11:21.690 --> 01:11:24.028
LAURA: I think all the boobies we hide.

01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:27.534
ASHLEY: Okay.
LAURA: But that's just me.

01:11:27.535 --> 01:11:29.299
MARISHA: Are we scouting
forward a little bit more?

01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:30.955
TALIESIN: I would scout forward a little.

01:11:30.956 --> 01:11:32.954
TRAVIS: Let's do it. Let's keep going.
ASHLEY: I think we should.

01:11:32.955 --> 01:11:34.712
MATT: "Very well. Lead on."

01:11:34.713 --> 01:11:37.359
What is the order?

01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:38.489
SAM: Alphabetical.

01:11:38.490 --> 01:11:39.400
MATT: Okay.

01:11:39.401 --> 01:11:42.059
(laughter)

01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:42.893
MATT: Ape.

01:11:42.894 --> 01:11:44.609
LIAM: Capeleb with Essek
on his shoulders still,

01:11:44.610 --> 01:11:46.279
unless Essek wanted to hop off.

01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:49.919
MATT: No, Essek has given
into his fate at the moment.

01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:50.883
TRAVIS: Jane.

01:11:50.884 --> 01:11:52.825
LAURA: Beau.
MARISHA: Beau.

01:11:52.826 --> 01:11:54.309
MATT: (laughs)

01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:57.560
Beau, Caduceus.

01:11:59.341 --> 01:12:00.174
LAURA: Fjord.

01:12:00.175 --> 01:12:01.609
MATT: Fjord,

01:12:01.610 --> 01:12:05.101
Jester, Veth, and Yasha.

01:12:05.102 --> 01:12:06.327
I remembered my letters!

01:12:06.328 --> 01:12:07.517
(cheering)

01:12:07.518 --> 01:12:09.078
LAURA: I think this is a
good order, honestly.

01:12:09.079 --> 01:12:11.390
MARISHA: Yeah, it's actually not bad.

01:12:11.391 --> 01:12:13.089
MATT: All righty.

01:12:13.090 --> 01:12:14.030
LAURA: Minus the traps

01:12:14.031 --> 01:12:16.279
that Capeleb is definitely
not going to find.

01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:18.699
MATT: Well, we'll get to that.
LIAM: Well, Essek's there.

01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:21.609
MATT: All right.

01:12:21.610 --> 01:12:23.949
So continuing down the extended hall,

01:12:23.950 --> 01:12:26.289
you can see some of the little pockets

01:12:26.290 --> 01:12:27.369
in the sides where some of these

01:12:27.370 --> 01:12:28.499
creatures had been traveling.

01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:32.318
There's little gaps in the
wall, like side ducting,

01:12:32.319 --> 01:12:33.949
where you can see it's broken

01:12:33.950 --> 01:12:36.589
and their space has been
pushed through by where they move.

01:12:36.590 --> 01:12:40.459
But the hallway continues and
then begins into an incline.

01:12:40.460 --> 01:12:41.293
TRAVIS: Hmm.

01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:47.790
MATT: About 150 or so feet
in from this intersection.

01:12:47.930 --> 01:12:50.299
LIAM: I'll add in, too,
Capeleb-- this is not

01:12:50.300 --> 01:12:52.099
the dumbest Caleb has
ever been as an animal.

01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:55.524
So I'm going slow.
He's going like-- (ape grunting)

01:12:55.525 --> 01:12:57.159
LAURA: Apes are very smart.

01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:59.219
LIAM: Yeah. He's going
real slow and putting a

01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:01.169
toe out and feeling,
and waiting a second,

01:13:01.170 --> 01:13:04.159
and then going because
he is scared of blowing up.

01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:06.459
MATT: Essek has maneuvered behind to keep

01:13:06.460 --> 01:13:10.385
any sort of blast radius
between-- with ape between.

01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:14.439
Progressing towards where
it begins to incline,

01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:16.909
you can see the incline was not natural.

01:13:16.910 --> 01:13:21.359
The metallic ceiling above
seems to have crinkled upward.

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:24.729
Like what was once a
straight path has been shoved

01:13:24.730 --> 01:13:26.169
and bent into an upward angle.

01:13:26.170 --> 01:13:28.809
And as it continues
upward, it is uneven.

01:13:28.810 --> 01:13:30.569
The impact and damage of the city seems

01:13:30.570 --> 01:13:32.799
to have completely offset what
was once a straight path,

01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:36.039
but it continues at about
a 45-degree angle upward.

01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:39.259
The frost and ice making it a
somewhat precarious climb.

01:13:39.260 --> 01:13:41.379
Though you can use the rubble and bits

01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:44.454
of exposed materials
to try and aid you up.

01:13:44.455 --> 01:13:46.849
But it is a bit of a climb.

01:13:46.850 --> 01:13:48.839
Do you continue to try and climb up?

01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:49.673
LAURA: Yeah.

01:13:49.674 --> 01:13:51.991
MATT: I would like everyone to
make an athletics check, please.

01:13:51.992 --> 01:13:52.825
LIAM: (ape grunting)

01:13:52.826 --> 01:13:55.157
Capeleb can take another
rider or two, probably.

01:13:55.158 --> 01:13:57.129
MARISHA: I'm assuming I'm
not still blessed, right?

01:13:57.130 --> 01:13:59.099
Oh, oh, that's--

01:13:59.100 --> 01:13:59.960
TRAVIS: 11.

01:13:59.961 --> 01:14:01.160
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, Bless is over.

01:14:02.030 --> 01:14:03.804
MATT: All right.
MARISHA: Athletics?

01:14:03.805 --> 01:14:05.329
TALIESIN: Give myself
some Guidance, though.

01:14:05.330 --> 01:14:07.132
MATT: All right. So 11?

01:14:07.133 --> 01:14:10.099
LAURA: I did not give
myself Guidance. So six.

01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:11.050
MATT: Six.

01:14:13.237 --> 01:14:14.070
LIAM: 20.

01:14:14.070 --> 01:14:14.903
MATT: 20?

01:14:14.904 --> 01:14:16.989
SAM: 20 also over here.

01:14:16.990 --> 01:14:18.622
MATT: For athletics? Nice.
SAM: Yeah.

01:14:18.623 --> 01:14:20.669
TALIESIN: It has to be
athletics, not acrobatics?

01:14:20.670 --> 01:14:22.619
MATT: Yes, for this.
TALIESIN: Okay.

01:14:22.620 --> 01:14:24.019
ASHLEY: 18.

01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:25.079
MATT: 18. Nice.

01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:27.109
Yeah, this is a very, very,

01:14:27.110 --> 01:14:29.832
very smooth, icy, slick surface.

01:14:29.833 --> 01:14:31.725
Acrobatics will not help you.

01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:35.369
Beauregard.
MARISHA: 19.

01:14:35.370 --> 01:14:36.883
MATT: 19. All right.

01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:43.559
This is a bit of a challenge
and most of you managed

01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:47.529
to begin to make the
climb, as hard as it is,

01:14:47.530 --> 01:14:49.943
leaping from section
of exposed rubble

01:14:49.944 --> 01:14:53.589
to heavy metal bars
that are bent outward

01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:55.319
and using those to get ahead.

01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:57.339
Those that rolled lower than a 15,

01:14:57.340 --> 01:14:59.649
you do stumble back
as you lose your grip

01:14:59.650 --> 01:15:01.429
and lose about 30 or 40 feet upward

01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:03.880
and do take a little
bit of impact damage.

01:15:08.930 --> 01:15:10.802
12 points of bludgeoning damage.
TRAVIS: That's not nothing.

01:15:10.803 --> 01:15:12.553
MATT: For those of you that
low rolled lower than a 15.

01:15:12.554 --> 01:15:14.329
LIAM: Soften, soften.
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

01:15:15.850 --> 01:15:17.209
LAURA: Yep. Yep.

01:15:17.210 --> 01:15:19.129
LIAM: Death by a thousand cuts.

01:15:19.130 --> 01:15:21.769
MATT: Everyone who failed,
I need you to roll again.

01:15:21.770 --> 01:15:24.089
MARISHA: Oh shit, y'all.

01:15:24.090 --> 01:15:24.923
TALIESIN: Okay.

01:15:26.290 --> 01:15:27.540
LAURA: Guidance.

01:15:29.510 --> 01:15:31.019
TRAVIS: 25.

01:15:31.020 --> 01:15:32.370
MATT: 25, all righty.

01:15:36.291 --> 01:15:37.870
LAURA: Oh! 15.

01:15:37.871 --> 01:15:39.404
MATT: 15, all righty.

01:15:40.863 --> 01:15:42.312
And who else failed?

01:15:42.313 --> 01:15:43.200
TALIESIN: 12.

01:15:43.201 --> 01:15:44.409
MATT: 12.

01:15:44.410 --> 01:15:45.449
MARISHA: Cad...

01:15:45.450 --> 01:15:46.360
TALIESIN: Bad at this.

01:15:46.361 --> 01:15:49.439
MATT: Two of you managed to,
working in tandem,

01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:50.380
get up there a bit.

01:15:50.381 --> 01:15:52.199
And as you get towards
the rest of the group,

01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:53.649
most of the way up to
where you can see

01:15:53.650 --> 01:15:56.349
it begins to turn off
and open the hallway.

01:15:56.350 --> 01:15:58.509
This is like a 200-foot
climb at this angle,

01:15:58.510 --> 01:16:02.169
just this ice-filled,
broken, awkward chamber.

01:16:02.170 --> 01:16:05.344
Caduceus, you slide back again.

01:16:05.345 --> 01:16:06.245
You don't fall,

01:16:06.246 --> 01:16:07.649
don't go back quite
as much this time

01:16:07.650 --> 01:16:09.489
as you've navigated this
now for a second time.

01:16:09.490 --> 01:16:12.239
But you do take four points
of bludgeoning damage.

01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:13.289
Not too bad.
TALIESIN: Ow.

01:16:13.290 --> 01:16:16.739
LIAM: Caleb's going to dodge
people and hop down and just

01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:18.379
scoop him up and put him
over his other shoulder.

01:16:18.380 --> 01:16:19.213
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Thank you.

01:16:19.214 --> 01:16:20.945
MATT: Essek's going to, actually,
as you begin moving down,

01:16:20.946 --> 01:16:22.859
Essek's going to be like, "Go ahead,"

01:16:22.860 --> 01:16:26.231
and just leaps off and is
hovering above the ice,

01:16:26.232 --> 01:16:27.823
unaffected by the slickness.

01:16:27.824 --> 01:16:30.491
LIAM: (ape grunting)

01:16:31.830 --> 01:16:34.343
MATT: Go ahead and make your check
for me please with your ape.

01:16:36.570 --> 01:16:38.649
LIAM: 18.
MATT: 18.

01:16:38.650 --> 01:16:41.529
With that, the whole group
manages to get to the very top

01:16:41.530 --> 01:16:45.759
of this incline where it
begins to even out slightly,

01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:48.852
still at a faint incline,
but no longer at that full,

01:16:48.853 --> 01:16:51.510
challenging upward climb.

01:16:52.632 --> 01:16:53.919
MARISHA: While I'm moving ahead,

01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:57.009
can I just have an eye out for

01:16:57.010 --> 01:17:01.759
any other signs of whoever
moved through here last?

01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:05.069
I know it was the
Tomb Takers and Vess, but--

01:17:05.070 --> 01:17:06.030
MATT: Sure, make a perception check.

01:17:06.031 --> 01:17:09.129
MARISHA: Any signs of activity.
MATT: You have your goggles back on?

01:17:09.130 --> 01:17:12.029
MARISHA: I think I got my
goggles back from Veth, yeah.

01:17:12.030 --> 01:17:14.529
MATT: Yeah, and for
those who do not have

01:17:14.530 --> 01:17:16.689
darkvision, there should
be a light source

01:17:16.690 --> 01:17:19.244
or you are having
a much harder time.

01:17:19.245 --> 01:17:20.739
TRAVIS: ♪ My sword is out ♪

01:17:20.740 --> 01:17:21.573
MARISHA: 16.

01:17:22.967 --> 01:17:24.017
16.

01:17:24.018 --> 01:17:25.559
MATT: 16.
MARISHA: It's okay.

01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:29.319
MATT: Hard pressed to see
much in here with the angle.

01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:31.189
There isn't, like, fresh snow.

01:17:31.190 --> 01:17:33.609
So you would imagine
you could probably

01:17:33.610 --> 01:17:35.069
take a moment and really inspect,

01:17:35.070 --> 01:17:37.109
but at the at the
challenge of this space,

01:17:37.110 --> 01:17:39.159
it's really difficult to
track anything like that.

01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:42.339
But once you get to a more smooth
area, you can have a look.

01:17:42.340 --> 01:17:43.490
MARISHA: Yeah, okay.

01:17:44.650 --> 01:17:46.699
MATT: So cresting at the
end of this hallway,

01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:49.379
you can see there's a
collapsed gap in the hall

01:17:49.380 --> 01:17:53.509
before it opens up
into another lightless chamber

01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:55.719
ahead of you about a 15--

01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:58.079
like 12- to 15-foot gap
where it just drops

01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:03.063
about 20 or so feet before
it comes to a gradual close.

01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:06.113
Like a miniature chasm.

01:18:07.367 --> 01:18:08.959
MARISHA: 20 feet?

01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:10.631
MATT: About 12 to 15 feet across.

01:18:10.632 --> 01:18:11.465
MARISHA: Oh, 12 to 15?

01:18:11.466 --> 01:18:13.836
MATT: Not too bad.
For most people.

01:18:16.276 --> 01:18:18.479
MARISHA: Can we see to
the other side?

01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:19.919
MATT: With the light
source you can have,

01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:21.509
and then you can see that it drops off

01:18:21.510 --> 01:18:23.843
and opens up into a
chamber with no light.

01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:26.769
MARISHA: And how deep is the chasm?

01:18:26.770 --> 01:18:27.750
MATT: That's about 20 or so feet.

01:18:27.751 --> 01:18:28.890
MARISHA: Okay, so it's not--

01:18:28.891 --> 01:18:31.290
MATT: It's not deadly or
anything. It's just annoying.

01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:34.873
MARISHA: Okay.

01:18:36.510 --> 01:18:38.510
TALIESIN: "Not deadly"
is code for "deadly."

01:18:41.060 --> 01:18:44.049
MARISHA: So you want me to
take a look on the other side?

01:18:44.050 --> 01:18:46.339
SAM: What is it, 15--
It's a 15-foot jump?

01:18:46.340 --> 01:18:48.680
MATT: Yeah, about 12 to 15 feet.
MARISHA: I can do that.

01:18:48.681 --> 01:18:51.365
SAM: We could make,
like, a human bridge.

01:18:51.366 --> 01:18:53.357
TRAVIS: (laughs)
MARISHA: Hmm.

01:18:53.358 --> 01:18:54.892
We could.

01:18:54.893 --> 01:18:57.229
LAURA: Or Beau can hold onto
some rope and jump across.

01:18:57.230 --> 01:18:58.556
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:18:58.557 --> 01:18:59.515
SAM: Okay.

01:18:59.515 --> 01:19:00.406
Yeah, go.

01:19:00.407 --> 01:19:03.189
MARISHA: Okay. I'll drop some
of the hemp ropes that I have,

01:19:03.190 --> 01:19:07.601
take one end, take a nice
running-- and then--

01:19:07.602 --> 01:19:08.879
MATT: Go ahead and make an
athletics check for me.

01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:10.030
MARISHA: Okay.

01:19:10.898 --> 01:19:12.121
SAM: Banana peel!

01:19:13.340 --> 01:19:15.033
MATT: This negates the
challenge of this--

01:19:15.034 --> 01:19:17.279
MARISHA: ♪ A natural 20! ♪

01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:18.113
MATT: Without issue.

01:19:18.114 --> 01:19:21.877
Even with the slickness
of the floor here,

01:19:21.878 --> 01:19:23.014
you don't even leap across,

01:19:23.015 --> 01:19:25.666
you jump off the wall
and find yourself

01:19:25.667 --> 01:19:28.239
wall running on the
opposite side without issue.

01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:31.053
MARISHA: That's a good idea.
That's exactly what I do.

01:19:31.054 --> 01:19:32.549
(laughter)

01:19:32.550 --> 01:19:34.169
MATT: Natural 20,
I'll spruce that up a bit.

01:19:34.170 --> 01:19:35.636
I'll throw some spice in.

01:19:37.870 --> 01:19:38.711
Easy enough to do.

01:19:38.712 --> 01:19:40.579
And the only one who
would have a challenge

01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:42.729
using the rope would be
you in your ape form,

01:19:42.730 --> 01:19:44.453
but in ape form,
you can practically

01:19:44.454 --> 01:19:46.735
step across it almost.
LIAM: I can leap it. It's 20 feet across?

01:19:46.736 --> 01:19:49.498
MATT: No, it's 12 to 15 feet. You can--

01:19:49.499 --> 01:19:51.469
LIAM: Yeah, with a 10-foot
run, I can clear it.

01:19:51.470 --> 01:19:52.303
MATT: Super easy.

01:19:52.304 --> 01:19:53.809
LIAM: Yeah.

01:19:53.810 --> 01:19:54.643
MATT: So.

01:19:54.644 --> 01:19:56.544
LIAM: (ape grunts)

01:19:56.545 --> 01:19:58.279
SAM: So are we all going across?

01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:00.359
Or no, you're going to
scout it out first.

01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:04.061
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll do a
quick, goggles-on visual pass

01:20:04.062 --> 01:20:05.895
now that I'm on this
side, that I'm closer.

01:20:05.896 --> 01:20:07.918
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: He won't know what hit him.

01:20:07.919 --> 01:20:09.393
MARISHA: Anything--? Okay.

01:20:10.570 --> 01:20:11.769
MATT: Once across this gap--

01:20:11.770 --> 01:20:12.909
SAM and ASHLEY: Oh boy.

01:20:12.910 --> 01:20:16.465
MATT: -- the hallway
levels out slightly and ends.

01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:21.399
And opens into an
incredibly massive chamber,

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:24.729
challenging to gauge
in size because there

01:20:24.730 --> 01:20:26.149
is a limit to your darkvision,

01:20:26.150 --> 01:20:28.213
but there is some light in here.

01:20:29.530 --> 01:20:32.500
It's hard to tell distance.
These little specks.

01:20:33.725 --> 01:20:36.021
A thousand feet across? More?

01:20:36.022 --> 01:20:37.279
SAM: Whoa.

01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:40.386
MATT: This is a
gargantuan cavern network

01:20:40.387 --> 01:20:43.027
that you're within,
or a massive space beneath.

01:20:43.028 --> 01:20:45.309
LAURA: (whispering) That's
where it disappeared.

01:20:45.310 --> 01:20:49.663
MATT: You can see, filling this
space below where you stand,

01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:57.840
a network of glimpses of a
sprawling, broken cityscape,

01:20:57.910 --> 01:21:00.759
faintly lit by a smattering
of still-glowing luminescent,

01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:03.349
blue and blue-green lights.

01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:06.243
Like a rolling field of
fireflies laying still.

01:21:07.430 --> 01:21:08.909
You can make out pockets of shapes

01:21:08.910 --> 01:21:10.371
like structures and towers,

01:21:10.372 --> 01:21:13.865
some leaning, some fallen into
what appear to be streets.

01:21:15.690 --> 01:21:18.429
You get the sense that
this is the entrance

01:21:18.430 --> 01:21:20.758
to the Praesidis Ward

01:21:20.759 --> 01:21:24.509
and beyond, part of this
long-buried necropolis

01:21:24.510 --> 01:21:25.510
that is Aeor.

01:21:26.889 --> 01:21:28.723
MARISHA: Praesidis Ward. Okay.

01:21:34.650 --> 01:21:39.133
Do I see anything that I
can anchor this rope to?

01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:44.748
MATT: There are weird
damaged bits of the wall

01:21:44.749 --> 01:21:48.009
and heavy stones you can
definitely affix this to.

01:21:48.010 --> 01:21:49.528
MARISHA: Okay. I'll tie it off.

01:21:49.529 --> 01:21:50.362
MATT: Okay.

01:21:51.390 --> 01:21:53.006
With that help, one by one,

01:21:53.007 --> 01:21:55.406
you guys can make your way
across the gap without major issue.

01:21:55.407 --> 01:21:56.924
LAURA: What's at the bottom of the gap

01:21:56.925 --> 01:21:59.239
if we look down?
Anything we can see?

01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:02.949
MATT: No, it looks like
when it bent downward,

01:22:02.950 --> 01:22:05.509
it snapped open and
left this gap below

01:22:05.510 --> 01:22:08.379
that eventually comes to
an end, like the actual--

01:22:08.380 --> 01:22:12.789
the base foundation of this
hallway then cracked open

01:22:12.790 --> 01:22:14.035
and left this gap.

01:22:14.036 --> 01:22:15.203
MARISHA: Okay.

01:22:18.011 --> 01:22:19.609
SAM: Yeah, then we'll follow.

01:22:19.610 --> 01:22:21.832
MATT: All right.
You guys are all across,

01:22:21.833 --> 01:22:24.339
and you see what
Beauregard had just seen.

01:22:24.340 --> 01:22:25.599
Just a faint outline.

01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:27.659
I mean, it's hard to see
with the light of the sword

01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:29.219
that close by to adjust,

01:22:29.220 --> 01:22:31.209
but if you darken it ever so
slightly and those who cannot

01:22:31.210 --> 01:22:33.219
see in the dark let their eyes adjust.

01:22:33.220 --> 01:22:37.373
You can see this massive, rolling,

01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:41.919
unnaturally scattered city.

01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:43.899
Mostly in shadow, with just those little

01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:47.549
points of blue and blue-green
light thrown about.

01:22:47.550 --> 01:22:50.419
LIAM: Is the blue-green light
similar or identical

01:22:50.420 --> 01:22:52.319
to what was thrown off
by the bubbles of people

01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:54.102
we found in the other Aeor ruins?

01:22:54.103 --> 01:22:55.003
MATT: The blue-green, no.

01:22:55.003 --> 01:22:55.836
LIAM: No?

01:22:55.837 --> 01:22:58.239
MATT: The blue could very well be.

01:22:58.240 --> 01:22:59.361
LIAM: Okay.

01:22:59.362 --> 01:23:03.079
MATT: And you see
hundreds throughout here

01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:04.633
and just enough light,

01:23:05.910 --> 01:23:08.379
just enough light pollution
from these sources,

01:23:08.380 --> 01:23:11.833
to just basically outline
the somewhat jagged,

01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:15.363
cragulous ceiling of
this chamber as well.

01:23:17.214 --> 01:23:19.929
But you see a whole
section of the city below.

01:23:19.930 --> 01:23:24.209
SAM: And the hallway that
opened out into this space,

01:23:24.210 --> 01:23:27.059
how wide and big is that opening?

01:23:27.060 --> 01:23:29.258
MATT: It's about 25 feet across
and about 20 feet tall.

01:23:29.259 --> 01:23:30.092
SAM: Okay.

01:23:31.330 --> 01:23:32.993
Is this a better ambush point?

01:23:32.994 --> 01:23:34.899
MARISHA: I don't know.

01:23:34.900 --> 01:23:36.839
SAM: Or fill back where we were?

01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:38.590
TALIESIN: Certainly a
better place to hide.

01:23:40.650 --> 01:23:41.839
MARISHA: Well, let's go check it out.

01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:43.188
There might be
more opportunities for...

01:23:43.189 --> 01:23:44.892
SAM: The whole thing?!

01:23:44.893 --> 01:23:45.859
MARISHA: I don't know.

01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:48.079
TALIESIN: Let's see what it's about.

01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:50.719
SAM: I'm just worried that
they're going to be on our six.

01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:52.459
I guess we have a radio, right?

01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:54.029
TALIESIN: We do.

01:23:54.030 --> 01:23:54.863
SAM: Okay.

01:23:54.864 --> 01:23:57.839
How long does it take to
set the intuit charge?

01:23:57.840 --> 01:23:59.339
LIAM: A minute if it's successful.

01:23:59.340 --> 01:24:01.459
I'll double check that,
but I think that's what it is.

01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:02.300
TRAVIS: There was a caveat.

01:24:02.301 --> 01:24:03.779
It has to be a 20 arcane.

01:24:03.780 --> 01:24:06.269
LIAM: Yeah. It's got to
be me-- Well, you have a

01:24:06.270 --> 01:24:09.553
high arcana, too, right?
TRAVIS: Otherwise it becomes inert for 24 hours.

01:24:10.418 --> 01:24:11.979
MARISHA: I have an okay arcana.

01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:14.079
LIAM: Yeah. One minute,
spend one minute,

01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:18.022
make a DC 20 intelligence arcana check.
SAM: So if they radioed us right now,

01:24:18.023 --> 01:24:21.249
we could run back and set them probably.

01:24:21.250 --> 01:24:23.239
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Hmm.

01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:24.740
LAURA: Maybe.
TRAVIS: Not at this point.

01:24:26.290 --> 01:24:27.414
That would be the--

01:24:27.415 --> 01:24:29.829
TALIESIN: We're pretty sure
they're not hot on our trail.

01:24:29.830 --> 01:24:31.778
That was why we did the
Commune in the first place.

01:24:31.779 --> 01:24:33.682
LIAM: But it's less than-- you asked

01:24:33.683 --> 01:24:34.782
less than a certain amount of time.

01:24:34.783 --> 01:24:36.265
SAM: Less than a day.
LIAM: Could be 20 minutes,

01:24:36.266 --> 01:24:38.369
or it could be 23 hours.

01:24:38.370 --> 01:24:41.389
We're also assuming we're
absolutely going to--

01:24:41.390 --> 01:24:42.223
(ape grunting)

01:24:42.224 --> 01:24:46.406
-hear from our spies,
but they could get iced.

01:24:46.407 --> 01:24:47.790
MARISHA: A hundred percent, yeah.

01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:55.718
LIAM: And picking--

01:24:55.719 --> 01:24:59.310
(whooshing) Sorry, I had an
idea and I had to share it.

01:24:59.311 --> 01:25:02.223
Oh. Caleb immediately sits
down on the ground, exhausted.

01:25:04.630 --> 01:25:06.188
Maybe if we move past this point

01:25:06.189 --> 01:25:11.187
and we tried to set
the boobies past here,

01:25:11.188 --> 01:25:13.899
there's so many different
directions they can run

01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:16.989
and scatter where things
are a little more contained.

01:25:16.990 --> 01:25:19.809
Behind us is maybe is worth considering.

01:25:19.810 --> 01:25:21.659
Could we take a break?

01:25:21.660 --> 01:25:23.469
SAM: Like a short rest?

01:25:23.470 --> 01:25:24.769
LIAM: I'm not doing very well.

01:25:24.770 --> 01:25:25.918
SAM: Oh no.
LAURA: Oh, that's right.

01:25:25.919 --> 01:25:28.544
He was really injured
before he turned into an ape.

01:25:30.850 --> 01:25:31.780
SAM: Sure.

01:25:31.781 --> 01:25:33.468
TRAVIS: ♪ Got to pick some
cover with some distance ♪

01:25:33.469 --> 01:25:34.773
♪ and a vantage point. ♪

01:25:34.774 --> 01:25:37.069
So let's go in further, and
then take that short rest.

01:25:37.070 --> 01:25:37.911
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:25:37.912 --> 01:25:39.569
TRAVIS: Because we're just
at the mouth of this thing.

01:25:39.570 --> 01:25:40.403
TALIESIN: I'm right on you.

01:25:40.404 --> 01:25:41.435
I'm going to stay right towards you.

01:25:41.436 --> 01:25:44.216
If anything looks
sketchy, I'm going to--

01:25:44.217 --> 01:25:45.599
LIAM: Maybe I'll walk
by you for a while.

01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:47.139
TALIESIN: Yeah. That's not a bad idea.

01:25:47.140 --> 01:25:49.372
MARISHA: Let's move through here.

01:25:49.373 --> 01:25:51.759
Very quietly, very stealthy.

01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:54.119
We don't want to get into
another fight and ideally

01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:56.843
we want to leave behind
some monsters for them.

01:26:00.220 --> 01:26:01.603
SAM: Yeah, sure.

01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:04.435
Leave only footprints.

01:26:04.436 --> 01:26:06.318
Take only memories.

01:26:06.319 --> 01:26:07.374
TRAVIS: Ooh. Wow.

01:26:07.375 --> 01:26:09.251
TALIESIN: Actually, don't leave footprints.
MARISHA: That's deep.

01:26:09.252 --> 01:26:10.897
Did you write that?
SAM: I did.

01:26:10.898 --> 01:26:12.647
MARISHA: Wow.
SAM: Yeah.

01:26:12.648 --> 01:26:14.139
But also don't leave footprints.

01:26:14.140 --> 01:26:15.936
TALIESIN: And if you leave memories,
then people are going

01:26:15.937 --> 01:26:17.019
to talk about you.

01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:17.853
SAM: That's true.

01:26:18.913 --> 01:26:20.609
TALIESIN: I mean, that's--

01:26:20.610 --> 01:26:21.443
LAURA: Let's see.

01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:23.879
ASHLEY: Quite profound.

01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:24.760
MATT: So what's the plan?

01:26:24.761 --> 01:26:27.759
LAURA: The healing kit only
stabilizes somebody that's down?

01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:28.925
It doesn't heal any?
MATT: Correct.

01:26:28.926 --> 01:26:30.508
You can take a feat to actually heal

01:26:30.509 --> 01:26:31.999
hit points with the healing kit.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.669
LAURA: I see. Okay.

01:26:34.670 --> 01:26:35.939
SAM: So yeah, I guess we'll just go

01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:37.569
into the city and look around?

01:26:37.570 --> 01:26:39.060
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: It's big!

01:26:39.061 --> 01:26:40.234
MATT: It's very big.

01:26:40.235 --> 01:26:42.249
You can begin the
process, if you want to.

01:26:42.250 --> 01:26:44.932
MARISHA: Walk down the
main thoroughfare.

01:26:44.933 --> 01:26:46.539
TRAVIS: How high is the ceiling of this

01:26:46.540 --> 01:26:48.693
giant, thousand-foot cavern?

01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:52.509
MATT: Just at a glance,
you'd say at places

01:26:52.510 --> 01:26:56.628
it's anywhere from 60
to a hundred more feet tall.

01:26:56.629 --> 01:26:58.467
TRAVIS: Yeah, fucker's big.

01:26:58.468 --> 01:27:00.199
And if it's a thousand feet deep,

01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:01.579
roughly how wide?

01:27:01.580 --> 01:27:03.529
MATT: You don't even
know how deep it is.

01:27:03.530 --> 01:27:04.699
You're guessing.

01:27:04.700 --> 01:27:07.129
Because right now, with
just the very faint bit

01:27:07.130 --> 01:27:08.899
of light that you can see,

01:27:08.900 --> 01:27:12.379
it's very hard to really
get depth perception

01:27:12.380 --> 01:27:13.213
in this space.

01:27:13.214 --> 01:27:15.937
TALIESIN: Let's find a
house to hide in, maybe,

01:27:15.938 --> 01:27:17.247
and stay off the main road.

01:27:17.248 --> 01:27:18.081
LIAM: Yeah.
MARISHA: We could do

01:27:18.082 --> 01:27:19.188
something like that. Find a house,

01:27:19.189 --> 01:27:21.030
and then always have a scouting party

01:27:21.031 --> 01:27:22.593
if we don't want to send everybody in.

01:27:22.594 --> 01:27:24.626
LIAM: And I don't think
we should go too far.

01:27:24.627 --> 01:27:27.839
The deeper in we get, it's
two people trying to sync up

01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:30.389
inside of Rexxentrum.

01:27:30.390 --> 01:27:31.396
LAURA: They could pass right by us

01:27:31.397 --> 01:27:32.920
and we wouldn't even know.
LIAM: Correct.

01:27:32.921 --> 01:27:34.446
TRAVIS: Yeah, you've lost
all advantage at that point.

01:27:34.447 --> 01:27:35.280
LIAM: Correct.

01:27:35.281 --> 01:27:37.149
TRAVIS: You got two people
in a maze instead of one

01:27:37.150 --> 01:27:38.140
looking down on the other.

01:27:38.140 --> 01:27:39.050
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

01:27:39.051 --> 01:27:40.399
MARISHA: Okay. Is there a house?

01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:42.049
If we start coming in,

01:27:42.050 --> 01:27:44.766
is there even a guard post,
or a house or something?

01:27:44.767 --> 01:27:45.929
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:27:45.930 --> 01:27:47.378
MARISHA: All right.
TALIESIN: I'll join you in that.

01:27:47.379 --> 01:27:48.788
MARISHA: Thank you, Caddy!

01:27:48.789 --> 01:27:50.169
MATT: Caduceus does not have darkvision.

01:27:50.170 --> 01:27:51.003
TALIESIN: I don't have darkvision.

01:27:51.004 --> 01:27:53.173
MATT: So you have
a disadvantage on this.

01:27:53.174 --> 01:27:54.849
MARISHA: ♪ I rolled a natural one. ♪

01:27:54.850 --> 01:27:57.009
TALIESIN: I rolled a 21.

01:27:57.010 --> 01:27:59.770
MATT: Nice. Well, thank goodness!

01:27:59.771 --> 01:28:02.603
LAURA: Those lights. He's used
to seeing firefly lights.

01:28:02.604 --> 01:28:03.829
MARISHA: Mm, mm.

01:28:03.830 --> 01:28:05.819
TALIESIN: I've been letting it
adjust over the last few minutes.

01:28:05.820 --> 01:28:08.339
I know how darkvision works.

01:28:08.340 --> 01:28:12.909
MATT: Beginning to pass this
threshold into this ward.

01:28:12.910 --> 01:28:15.349
Beyond this tunnel, you can
see there are walls around

01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:17.969
that once probably surrounded this ward.

01:28:17.970 --> 01:28:19.809
Though many of them have fallen in or

01:28:19.810 --> 01:28:23.167
themselves have had
things fall into them,

01:28:23.168 --> 01:28:25.659
but not more than 30 or so feet inward,

01:28:25.660 --> 01:28:26.879
you can see the beginning of what

01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:28.509
may have been a neighborhood.

01:28:28.510 --> 01:28:32.089
There are a dozen or so buildings
within this first section,

01:28:32.090 --> 01:28:34.499
though most of them are fully collapsed.

01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:38.829
You can see this edge
probably took the brunt

01:28:38.830 --> 01:28:40.129
of the impact of the city,

01:28:40.130 --> 01:28:42.709
and the city was built
to withstand a lot.

01:28:42.710 --> 01:28:45.559
So the fact that even
this much is standing,

01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:47.069
and isn't just a complete mess

01:28:47.070 --> 01:28:48.929
is a testament to its
original construction

01:28:48.930 --> 01:28:51.339
and/or protective wards at the time.

01:28:51.340 --> 01:28:55.769
But even so, out of these
immediate vicinity structures,

01:28:55.770 --> 01:28:57.999
you only see two that
haven't completely collapsed

01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:59.799
that have any sort of
interior that you could

01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:01.449
probably walk into with cover.

01:29:01.450 --> 01:29:03.569
TALIESIN: How do they look?

01:29:03.570 --> 01:29:07.979
MATT: Dubious. But you see one
that's a smaller building.

01:29:07.980 --> 01:29:10.279
Maybe singular story,
may have a second story

01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:12.159
that sheared off or fell.

01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:15.039
The other one is
most of a second story,

01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:18.247
but even that, you can only
see the wall is partial.

01:29:18.248 --> 01:29:22.231
They have open windows and
one doorway is currently closed.

01:29:22.232 --> 01:29:23.488
The doors still affixed. The other,

01:29:23.489 --> 01:29:24.897
the door's been blown out.

01:29:24.898 --> 01:29:26.542
TALIESIN: Door it is.

01:29:26.543 --> 01:29:31.543
Are there any signs of
previous life? Are there any?

01:29:31.620 --> 01:29:33.771
MATT: After looking out
around, you look down

01:29:33.772 --> 01:29:35.989
and on the ground,
amongst the broken stone

01:29:35.990 --> 01:29:38.545
and brick and shattered glass,

01:29:38.546 --> 01:29:41.828
you can begin to see bodies.

01:29:41.829 --> 01:29:46.829
You see skeletal bodies,
long mummified.

01:29:46.930 --> 01:29:51.930
Many crushed in some
degree, others incinerated.

01:29:52.047 --> 01:29:56.171
It looks like the
long-forgotten aftermath

01:29:56.172 --> 01:29:57.462
of a cataclysm.

01:29:57.463 --> 01:30:00.219
TALIESIN: Eyes of the Grave?

01:30:00.220 --> 01:30:01.053
MATT: Okay.

01:30:01.054 --> 01:30:03.421
LAURA: Oh yeah. Oh, right.

01:30:03.422 --> 01:30:05.572
Do you have to Speak to Dead prepared?

01:30:05.573 --> 01:30:06.636
TALIESIN: I can do that, too,

01:30:06.637 --> 01:30:09.801
but at the moment,
I'm doing a 60-foot sweep

01:30:09.802 --> 01:30:11.593
for undead activity.
TRAVIS: There's three undead giants outside.

01:30:11.594 --> 01:30:13.366
LAURA: Yeah.

01:30:13.367 --> 01:30:16.079
MATT: As you extend your
consciousness into that space

01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:17.783
between life and death,

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:24.459
you breathe a sigh of relief,
not sensing anything untoward

01:30:24.460 --> 01:30:26.239
in between that space.

01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:28.206
TRAVIS: Good thinking, though.

01:30:28.207 --> 01:30:29.373
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:30:31.390 --> 01:30:34.019
Yeah. Let's scoot
everybody into this place.

01:30:34.020 --> 01:30:37.727
Give it a little look through
and make sure it's clean and

01:30:39.127 --> 01:30:40.589
nothing's nesting in it.

01:30:40.590 --> 01:30:41.759
MATT: Okay.

01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:43.099
LIAM: Caleb is going to,

01:30:43.100 --> 01:30:44.509
with a bit of phosphorus in his hand,

01:30:44.510 --> 01:30:46.899
taking a half beat longer than normal,

01:30:46.900 --> 01:30:49.929
cast Dancing Lights
and bring globules out.

01:30:49.930 --> 01:30:53.619
But for once they're
roughly the same color

01:30:53.620 --> 01:30:55.899
as the blue that we can
see in the distance.

01:30:55.900 --> 01:30:56.733
MATT: Okay.

01:30:56.733 --> 01:30:57.640
LIAM: So still glowing, but--

01:30:57.641 --> 01:30:59.569
MATT: Right. But matching the coloration.

01:30:59.570 --> 01:31:04.231
Okay. Fair enough. You all
follow towards this structure?

01:31:04.232 --> 01:31:05.884
LIAM: Yeah.
LAURA: Yes.

01:31:05.885 --> 01:31:06.759
MATT: All right.

01:31:06.759 --> 01:31:07.592
MARISHA: Quietly.

01:31:07.593 --> 01:31:10.155
MATT: You approach the outside
of it. It's, you know,

01:31:10.156 --> 01:31:11.729
for the parts that are still standing

01:31:11.730 --> 01:31:13.963
and aren't completely scuffed or

01:31:15.086 --> 01:31:19.942
left to absolute ruin, well-made.

01:31:19.943 --> 01:31:23.923
The arch of the door has
fine-carved filigree around it.

01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:26.297
It gives you a glimpse
that you can imagine

01:31:26.298 --> 01:31:28.639
one day, this was a very beautiful city.

01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:30.389
A lot of thought and
effort went into just

01:31:30.390 --> 01:31:33.759
the small details to beautify
some of these structures.

01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:38.604
And this is a shameful
contrast juxtaposition between

01:31:38.605 --> 01:31:41.779
the care that was
obviously put into this

01:31:41.780 --> 01:31:44.399
and the complete destruction that it now

01:31:44.400 --> 01:31:46.999
lays surrounded by and is part of.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.413
The door is very fine wood.

01:31:50.580 --> 01:31:52.179
But as you approach, you can see

01:31:52.180 --> 01:31:54.309
that it's mostly off one of the hinges.

01:31:54.310 --> 01:31:56.503
And while it still stands, not by much.

01:31:58.610 --> 01:32:00.839
TALIESIN: Does anybody know
how to mend, out of curiosity?

01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:02.745
LAURA: I do. I have Mending.

01:32:02.746 --> 01:32:05.450
TALIESIN: Let's fix this joint
just so this thing doesn't

01:32:05.451 --> 01:32:07.593
rattle and cause a problem,
maybe. I'll hold it up.

01:32:07.594 --> 01:32:09.159
LAURA: I ready a cantrip.

01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:11.010
MATT: Okay. You heard
this faint (creaking).

01:32:11.011 --> 01:32:13.559
As it does, the metal seems
to pull out against itself.

01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:17.180
And the broken hinge
re-tethers, pulls the door,

01:32:17.181 --> 01:32:18.509
shifts right into place.

01:32:18.510 --> 01:32:20.311
LAURA: Good thinking!

01:32:20.312 --> 01:32:21.791
TALIESIN: I've always wanted
to learn how to do that.

01:32:21.792 --> 01:32:23.392
I just don't have the--

01:32:23.393 --> 01:32:24.385
LAURA: I could teach you!

01:32:24.386 --> 01:32:26.608
TALIESIN: I'd love that because
my fingers hate that spell.

01:32:26.609 --> 01:32:28.208
I don't know. It never works right.

01:32:28.209 --> 01:32:29.911
LIAM: Just take a pottery class.

01:32:29.912 --> 01:32:32.073
TALIESIN: You know, I've been
thinking about it so much.

01:32:32.074 --> 01:32:33.974
LAURA: We'll take a pottery class
when all of this is over.

01:32:33.975 --> 01:32:35.949
TALIESIN: There's an
annex that's over in--

01:32:35.950 --> 01:32:38.669
I've been meaning to--

01:32:38.670 --> 01:32:41.089
SAM: Is there anything in this house?

01:32:41.090 --> 01:32:42.612
I will look around.
MATT: Pull the door open

01:32:42.613 --> 01:32:43.799
and you begin to look around.

01:32:43.800 --> 01:32:45.679
Go ahead and make a
perception or investigation check.

01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:48.299
Your choice.
SAM: Investigation.

01:32:48.300 --> 01:32:50.039
23.

01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:53.100
MATT: 23, okay. As you
carefully make your way in

01:32:53.960 --> 01:32:56.360
looking around the space
and beginning to inspect.

01:32:57.230 --> 01:33:00.169
Indeed. Most of the second floor
fell inward because

01:33:00.170 --> 01:33:02.289
you see there was a staircase
that would spiral upward,

01:33:02.290 --> 01:33:05.189
but the staircase is
partially broken and fallen.

01:33:05.190 --> 01:33:06.889
You can see the space
where it went up is now

01:33:06.890 --> 01:33:10.709
filled with heavy wooden
support bars that are

01:33:10.710 --> 01:33:14.079
just jammed ram-shod down
from the upper floor.

01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:16.289
The interior here has
furniture scattered about.

01:33:16.290 --> 01:33:17.839
And once again, it gives a
glimpse of what may have

01:33:17.840 --> 01:33:21.384
been a nice family space.

01:33:21.385 --> 01:33:25.439
You could see what looked
to be planters and

01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:27.369
tables with decor on them

01:33:27.370 --> 01:33:28.829
that have tipped over and shattered.

01:33:28.830 --> 01:33:31.009
There's shards of pottery on the ground.

01:33:31.010 --> 01:33:35.909
And you can see a number
of skeletal bodies

01:33:35.910 --> 01:33:38.739
that are scattered amongst the rubble.

01:33:38.740 --> 01:33:40.510
One does catch your attention,

01:33:41.570 --> 01:33:46.249
a little different from
the other corpses,

01:33:46.250 --> 01:33:48.460
similar to one that you had encountered

01:33:50.521 --> 01:33:51.749
in one of the previous ruins.

01:33:51.750 --> 01:33:54.920
It looks humanoid,
but you can see it pulled apart.

01:33:54.921 --> 01:33:57.849
And at first glance, it's not
mummified like the others.

01:33:57.850 --> 01:34:02.684
It's metallic with
intricate scrolling on it.

01:34:02.685 --> 01:34:04.179
Where the joints would be,

01:34:04.180 --> 01:34:08.739
you see a striated, dark material,

01:34:08.740 --> 01:34:11.159
like a rubber-ish,
and it's just pulled apart,

01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:15.669
and half of the upper floor collapse

01:34:15.670 --> 01:34:18.219
has pinned and pulled it in twine.

01:34:18.220 --> 01:34:19.759
You can see the head partially exposed.

01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:23.659
And it looks like a human-sized head,
but the features--

01:34:23.660 --> 01:34:25.879
it is a metallic smooth helmet

01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:27.729
with features carved into it.

01:34:27.730 --> 01:34:29.358
Sockets where eyes would be.

01:34:29.359 --> 01:34:31.709
And a jaw that is pulled off.

01:34:31.710 --> 01:34:33.534
SAM: Cool.
LIAM: Robits, y'all, robits.

01:34:33.535 --> 01:34:38.459
SAM: Can I fish around in that
body for some shiny objects?

01:34:38.460 --> 01:34:39.784
MATT: Sure.
SAM: For some gears,

01:34:39.785 --> 01:34:42.516
or some cool tech.

01:34:42.517 --> 01:34:43.350
MATT: Go for it.

01:34:43.351 --> 01:34:45.469
Go ahead and make an
investigation check for that one.

01:34:45.470 --> 01:34:47.399
SAM: Oh, even better. 28.

01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:49.769
MATT: 28. It's easy enough to pull apart

01:34:49.770 --> 01:34:52.615
the body, the upper area where

01:34:52.616 --> 01:34:54.709
the metallic chest cavity would be.

01:34:54.710 --> 01:34:56.649
It's partially already pried apart

01:34:56.650 --> 01:34:57.799
from how it was destroyed.

01:34:57.800 --> 01:34:59.379
And as you pick it off,

01:34:59.380 --> 01:35:01.619
you can see in the center
of it, amongst all the--

01:35:01.620 --> 01:35:04.689
it is an odd, odd combination

01:35:04.690 --> 01:35:07.559
of arcane tethers and runic,

01:35:08.784 --> 01:35:13.466
circular-affixed creations
that you're not--

01:35:13.467 --> 01:35:14.879
you don't fully understand.

01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:16.809
But a lot of it seems pulled and broken.

01:35:16.810 --> 01:35:20.851
In the middle of it there is
a small orb. A smooth orb.

01:35:20.852 --> 01:35:22.802
That just sits. It's untouched.

01:35:24.081 --> 01:35:26.389
SAM: Like where the heart would be -ish?

01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:27.477
MATT: Yeah.

01:35:27.478 --> 01:35:30.029
SAM: Okay. I'm going to try to take that.

01:35:30.030 --> 01:35:32.229
MATT: Okay.
ASHLEY: Underneath the ribs?

01:35:32.230 --> 01:35:33.979
MATT: Yeah. When you pulled
the chest plate off

01:35:33.980 --> 01:35:34.970
you can see it within there.

01:35:34.970 --> 01:35:35.860
LIAM: Yeah.

01:35:35.861 --> 01:35:37.980
MATT: So you go ahead and pull down and

01:35:37.981 --> 01:35:39.199
it doesn't take too much.

01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:41.529
You see that this chest plate
that was on front

01:35:41.530 --> 01:35:43.769
was what was partially
holding it in place.

01:35:43.770 --> 01:35:47.894
And the other half of its
exterior secure cavity

01:35:47.895 --> 01:35:48.893
is now left open.

01:35:48.894 --> 01:35:51.922
So you, with a little bit
of pulling and twisting,

01:35:51.923 --> 01:35:53.671
(sucking gasp) pull it free.

01:35:53.672 --> 01:35:55.389
There's just a little smooth crystal.

01:35:55.390 --> 01:35:57.749
Doesn't seem to have any color to it.

01:35:57.750 --> 01:36:01.489
It's opaque, a cloudy, opaque color,

01:36:01.490 --> 01:36:02.779
white, I guess, if anything,

01:36:02.780 --> 01:36:05.749
but just looks like a smooth sphere.

01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:06.809
SAM: Caleb, when you feel better,

01:36:06.810 --> 01:36:09.369
maybe you could identify this for me?

01:36:09.370 --> 01:36:12.999
LIAM: Okay. Well, if
we stop for a while,

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.259
I can do that, certainly.

01:36:14.260 --> 01:36:15.892
TALIESIN: I think this
is the place to take

01:36:15.893 --> 01:36:18.058
just a little while to rest

01:36:18.059 --> 01:36:20.313
and get you back to--
LIAM: Before we go any deeper?

01:36:20.314 --> 01:36:21.482
LAURA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Before we go any deeper.

01:36:21.483 --> 01:36:26.483
ASHLEY: Wait, Caduceus, remember
you asked me for a skull head?

01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:29.096
Do you think that would work with this?

01:36:29.097 --> 01:36:32.419
TALIESIN: Well, that one
doesn't seem to have a jaw,

01:36:32.420 --> 01:36:34.119
which is definitely a bit of a problem.

01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:35.710
LAURA: Right, and it
doesn't have a soul,

01:36:35.711 --> 01:36:36.926
potentially, either.

01:36:36.927 --> 01:36:38.119
TALIESIN: Well, I mean, who knows?

01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:39.519
LAURA: I don't know how
these things work.

01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:40.802
TALIESIN: I don't know either.

01:36:40.803 --> 01:36:41.985
SAM: Don't be judgemental!

01:36:41.986 --> 01:36:45.904
TALIESIN: I would not say no to taking it with us.
LAURA: I don't know, do robots have souls?

01:36:45.905 --> 01:36:47.805
SAM: What's a robit?

01:36:47.806 --> 01:36:49.151
LAURA: I mean, that's a good point.

01:36:49.152 --> 01:36:51.854
ASHLEY: Oh, this is the-- I got it.

01:36:51.855 --> 01:36:54.061
TALIESIN and ASHLEY: This
is the Schwarzenegger.

01:36:54.062 --> 01:36:56.005
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:36:56.006 --> 01:36:58.529
I would not say no to taking it, though.

01:36:58.530 --> 01:36:59.829
SAM: The whole body?

01:36:59.830 --> 01:37:01.054
LIAM: The heart.

01:37:01.055 --> 01:37:02.589
LAURA: How would we carry it?

01:37:02.590 --> 01:37:04.691
TALIESIN: It's true. We don't really--
LAURA: We don't have a bag

01:37:04.692 --> 01:37:05.592
TALIESIN: -- way to carry.

01:37:05.592 --> 01:37:06.425
LIAM: We do.

01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:12.647
MARISHA: Would you want to still
do the talky thing with another?

01:37:12.648 --> 01:37:15.569
TALIESIN: I can't do the talky
thing right now, I don't think.

01:37:15.570 --> 01:37:16.809
TRAVIS: Is everyone inside the building?

01:37:16.810 --> 01:37:17.859
TALIESIN: Thought I'd taken--

01:37:17.860 --> 01:37:19.609
MATT: Everyone I believe, unless you--

01:37:19.610 --> 01:37:23.018
TRAVIS: I will leave the
building and look outside.

01:37:23.019 --> 01:37:23.927
SAM: Fjord, no!

01:37:23.928 --> 01:37:25.260
LAURA: No, I was
thinking that was smart.

01:37:25.261 --> 01:37:27.561
We should keep an eye on the
outside of the building.

01:37:27.562 --> 01:37:30.212
TRAVIS: Just a sentry from
the direction we came.

01:37:30.213 --> 01:37:32.477
MATT: Okay. All right.
So you're keeping watch?

01:37:32.478 --> 01:37:34.259
LAURA: I'm going to give him
Guidance on the way out,

01:37:34.260 --> 01:37:38.919
so that any-- I guess
for the next minute,

01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:41.569
if you do a perception check,
you'll get an advantage.

01:37:41.570 --> 01:37:43.569
MATT: All right. So everyone
is taking a short rest, then?

01:37:43.570 --> 01:37:44.403
LIAM: Yes, please.

01:37:44.404 --> 01:37:48.109
TRAVIS: Oh, well, I'm going to
take a short rest as well.

01:37:48.110 --> 01:37:49.734
MATT: Yeah, well, you can take a short rest
while keeping an eye out.

01:37:49.735 --> 01:37:51.579
TRAVIS: Great!

01:37:51.580 --> 01:37:53.478
MARISHA: Yeah, okay.
LIAM: What've we got?

01:37:53.479 --> 01:37:54.930
MATT: Essek's going to use
the last of his hit dice.

01:37:54.931 --> 01:37:56.639
LIAM: Hit dice it is.

01:37:56.640 --> 01:37:58.940
SAM: We're doing this?
We're doing a reals, a real--

01:37:58.941 --> 01:37:59.979
LAURA: I guess so. Another.

01:37:59.980 --> 01:38:01.227
TALIESIN: If you want to--
SAM: Wow.

01:38:01.228 --> 01:38:02.077
LAURA: We're waiting an hour?

01:38:02.078 --> 01:38:04.031
MARISHA: Okay. Yeah, I know.

01:38:04.032 --> 01:38:05.189
Hoo, hoo, hoo!

01:38:05.190 --> 01:38:07.530
LAURA: I wish I had a place that's--

01:38:08.486 --> 01:38:13.486
MATT: Okay. Essek's hit dice are spent.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:15.059
MARISHA: For Essek?

01:38:15.060 --> 01:38:16.699
LAURA: It sucks because if I could take,

01:38:16.700 --> 01:38:18.269
you know, if we could set the trap,

01:38:18.270 --> 01:38:19.779
and then I could try
to get the long rest

01:38:19.780 --> 01:38:21.639
I would get a 7th-level spell back.

01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:23.409
This glyph is a 7th-level spell.

01:38:23.410 --> 01:38:25.339
So it's like, I can do it,

01:38:25.340 --> 01:38:28.849
but I also won't have a
big spell for a big fight.

01:38:28.850 --> 01:38:30.729
If I can set it now and try to sleep.

01:38:30.730 --> 01:38:31.570
MARISHA: And sleep?

01:38:31.571 --> 01:38:34.383
LAURA: So if we can find
that ambush point stat,

01:38:35.450 --> 01:38:39.053
then, you know, we could
potentially be in a better place.

01:38:42.162 --> 01:38:43.752
LIAM: Need higher rolls.

01:38:43.753 --> 01:38:44.586
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:49.329
LAURA: I know, it's just these
high level spells will come

01:38:49.330 --> 01:38:52.729
in handy in a big fight. Potentially.

01:38:52.730 --> 01:38:55.889
MARISHA: Well, we're going to need
to rest at some point, right?

01:38:55.890 --> 01:38:59.363
I'm down with us just
continuing to stay fresh.

01:39:01.420 --> 01:39:05.136
ASHLEY: Yeah. I think it's smart.

01:39:05.137 --> 01:39:06.103
MARISHA: Okay. Hang on, wait on me.

01:39:06.104 --> 01:39:08.810
LIAM: I've used all my
hit dice and I am not at full.

01:39:08.811 --> 01:39:09.752
SAM: Oh no.

01:39:10.670 --> 01:39:11.989
TALIESIN: Where are you at?

01:39:11.990 --> 01:39:13.519
LIAM: 55 of 87.

01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:14.353
SAM: Oof!

01:39:14.354 --> 01:39:18.829
LAURA: Like, what's the
point of continuing on

01:39:18.830 --> 01:39:22.679
and just finding more monsters
and a potential ambush point

01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:23.949
when we know we can find something

01:39:23.950 --> 01:39:26.100
in a place that we've
already been through?

01:39:27.388 --> 01:39:28.788
LIAM: That would be my thinking.

01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:32.917
TRAVIS: Yeah. We definitely
don't want to fight in here.

01:39:32.918 --> 01:39:33.999
LAURA: No.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.512
TRAVIS: We were in a-- yeah.

01:39:36.513 --> 01:39:38.739
LIAM: Be good to know what
we might be fleeing toward.

01:39:38.740 --> 01:39:39.859
TALIESIN: That was my thinking.

01:39:39.860 --> 01:39:40.899
LIAM: But--

01:39:40.900 --> 01:39:42.569
TALIESIN: With my last
question: what are those

01:39:42.570 --> 01:39:43.929
blue and green lights, though?

01:39:43.930 --> 01:39:46.759
LAURA: Like, Fjord, you fought
a lot of people in your time

01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:48.094
at sea, right?

01:39:48.095 --> 01:39:50.009
TRAVIS: Oh, loads of people.

01:39:50.010 --> 01:39:51.139
LAURA: No, but I mean, didn't

01:39:51.140 --> 01:39:52.890
they teach you, like,
combat maneuvers and stuff?

01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:56.480
When you were, like, I don't know.

01:39:56.481 --> 01:39:59.054
TRAVIS: It's like ship warfare. I mean,
line of sight is everything.

01:39:59.055 --> 01:40:01.569
LAURA: So what would be the best
ambush point, in your opinion?

01:40:01.570 --> 01:40:04.269
TRAVIS: Not here. Anywhere
that you can see them

01:40:04.270 --> 01:40:05.726
before they can see you in some way.

01:40:05.727 --> 01:40:09.429
Or that you can take cover
until they reach your position.

01:40:09.430 --> 01:40:11.989
I mean, that's the basic point of it.

01:40:11.990 --> 01:40:13.922
I mean, if we're in this
giant thousand-foot

01:40:13.923 --> 01:40:16.263
by thousand-foot cavern
and we're in a city,

01:40:18.590 --> 01:40:20.438
no one has the advantage.

01:40:20.439 --> 01:40:22.872
Except those that can fly.
LAURA: The best point still,

01:40:22.873 --> 01:40:24.429
from everything that we've seen so far,

01:40:24.430 --> 01:40:28.132
is that initial cavern
fall down into the ground.

01:40:28.133 --> 01:40:29.629
TRAVIS: Unless there's a
feature of this cavern

01:40:29.630 --> 01:40:31.199
that we can find somehow quickly

01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:33.129
in the next, I don't know, hour or so.

01:40:33.130 --> 01:40:35.709
Assuming that they don't
come and aren't radioed.

01:40:35.710 --> 01:40:37.549
Otherwise, we'd need to
find some sort of feature

01:40:37.550 --> 01:40:39.219
beyond this cavern to make a--

01:40:39.220 --> 01:40:40.659
LAURA: Which I don't
think is smart to keep

01:40:40.660 --> 01:40:42.245
wasting time like that.
LIAM: No.

01:40:42.246 --> 01:40:44.569
LAURA: I think we should
just go and set it up there.

01:40:44.570 --> 01:40:46.209
TRAVIS: Unless your
plan is to fly overhead

01:40:46.210 --> 01:40:47.710
and see if there's
anything that jumps out

01:40:47.711 --> 01:40:48.985
from a bird's eye view.

01:40:48.986 --> 01:40:51.009
LAURA: But there could also
be something that "jumps out"

01:40:51.010 --> 01:40:52.479
at a bird's eye view.

01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:53.953
TRAVIS: I mean--
LIAM: Yeah.

01:40:53.954 --> 01:40:55.244
TRAVIS: It's a risk either way.

01:40:55.245 --> 01:40:56.801
LIAM: I mean, the only
thing I would think to do,

01:40:56.802 --> 01:41:00.679
maybe, is to send Frumpkin
just on a little walk.

01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:02.149
TALIESIN: That's a good idea.
LIAM: And see further in,

01:41:02.150 --> 01:41:04.701
but that's about all
I'd really want to do.

01:41:04.702 --> 01:41:07.976
MARISHA: Well. And to your point,

01:41:07.977 --> 01:41:11.209
with this big, sprawling cityscape

01:41:11.210 --> 01:41:14.669
in the dark, if we are in a bad position

01:41:14.670 --> 01:41:16.160
and we do need to retreat

01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:19.389
coming here and trying to hide, I mean,

01:41:19.390 --> 01:41:23.467
it would then turn into a
little game of hide and seek.

01:41:23.468 --> 01:41:25.899
TRAVIS: These buildings suck. They suck.

01:41:25.900 --> 01:41:28.529
MARISHA: But we fight them
there and can flee here.

01:41:28.530 --> 01:41:31.209
Maybe we can even find a
good hiding spot here.

01:41:31.210 --> 01:41:32.809
If shit really starts hitting the fan.

01:41:32.810 --> 01:41:35.059
LAURA: This building right here,
this is a great hiding spot.

01:41:35.060 --> 01:41:38.529
MARISHA: I mean, we could make
this like our fallback Alamo.

01:41:38.530 --> 01:41:40.419
TRAVIS: Why are we hiding?

01:41:40.420 --> 01:41:41.479
LAURA: In case we start to die

01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:43.821
and we don't want to run away fully?

01:41:43.822 --> 01:41:45.319
(laughs)

01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:47.893
In case we're carrying
dead bodies and fleeing?

01:41:49.163 --> 01:41:50.629
TRAVIS: Are we fleeing?

01:41:50.630 --> 01:41:53.089
MARISHA: Well, just if
we need to go to here.

01:41:53.090 --> 01:41:56.762
If we needed to run back and, you know,

01:41:56.763 --> 01:41:58.539
find a pullback spot.

01:41:58.540 --> 01:42:00.825
LIAM: We're going to murder-lize them.

01:42:00.826 --> 01:42:01.659
We're going to destroy them.

01:42:01.660 --> 01:42:03.489
But if things go south on us,

01:42:03.490 --> 01:42:08.490
as they are wont to do, I think,

01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:10.019
please think this out with me.

01:42:10.020 --> 01:42:13.527
But as you said earlier,

01:42:13.528 --> 01:42:16.393
a sigil high up out of view

01:42:16.394 --> 01:42:18.709
where the rope is, they are hurt,

01:42:18.710 --> 01:42:23.009
they fall land in a
circle of intuit charges,

01:42:23.010 --> 01:42:25.419
take secondary damage almost instantly,

01:42:25.420 --> 01:42:29.009
and we are waiting in
that salamander chamber.

01:42:29.010 --> 01:42:30.279
LAURA: Can I ask a question?

01:42:30.280 --> 01:42:32.627
Based on the travels that we had before,

01:42:32.628 --> 01:42:35.702
that, you know how
there was a little crevice

01:42:35.703 --> 01:42:38.999
that led to the ledge that
went down the initial--

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:39.955
MATT: Correct.
LAURA: -- the crawlspace

01:42:39.955 --> 01:42:40.788
that led to the--

01:42:40.789 --> 01:42:44.709
How long was that
crawlspace? Like 15 feet?

01:42:44.710 --> 01:42:48.202
MATT: If I recall, it was
maybe about 25 or 30 feet?

01:42:48.203 --> 01:42:49.818
TRAVIS: A couple of bodies' lengths?
MATT: Yeah.

01:42:49.819 --> 01:42:52.426
LAURA: So yeah. So if we put the sigil

01:42:52.427 --> 01:42:55.934
on the edge of the crawl space

01:42:55.935 --> 01:42:58.379
when you're first looking down.

01:42:58.380 --> 01:43:00.919
And what sets it off is somebody looking out.

01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:05.679
It would hit, I mean, it would
hit whoever was up there,

01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:07.309
or whoever first took it down,

01:43:07.310 --> 01:43:09.849
and then anybody waiting
up top would also be hit

01:43:09.850 --> 01:43:11.593
because it's a 60-foot radius.

01:43:12.780 --> 01:43:14.139
TRAVIS: You know,
there's always a chance,

01:43:14.140 --> 01:43:16.397
even though they've been here before,

01:43:16.398 --> 01:43:18.880
they're smart and send one person ahead

01:43:18.881 --> 01:43:20.233
just to see if anything's changed?

01:43:20.234 --> 01:43:21.067
LAURA: Sure. But they could wait

01:43:21.068 --> 01:43:22.589
on the outside of that crawl space.

01:43:22.590 --> 01:43:23.709
They would still be hit.

01:43:23.710 --> 01:43:25.775
TRAVIS: Totally.
LAURA: Even if it was one at a time--

01:43:25.776 --> 01:43:27.829
TRAVIS: They just won't fall, and
they just won't hit the stack

01:43:27.830 --> 01:43:29.963
to empty the charges and
that will all be rendered--

01:43:29.964 --> 01:43:32.687
LIAM: And just one
more thing to remember

01:43:32.688 --> 01:43:35.828
about the intuit charges is
they will go off once someone

01:43:35.829 --> 01:43:39.343
comes within 60 feet, so they
need to be spaced properly.

01:43:39.344 --> 01:43:40.916
LAURA: Right.
MARISHA: Right.

01:43:43.015 --> 01:43:43.848
MARISHA: Okay.

01:43:43.849 --> 01:43:47.454
So there's the plan of putting the sigil

01:43:47.455 --> 01:43:49.847
on the edge of the crawlspace.

01:43:49.848 --> 01:43:51.174
LAURA: That was just an option.

01:43:51.175 --> 01:43:53.004
The other one would be,
like, they could put it

01:43:53.005 --> 01:43:55.747
right down as soon as they
come down on the ground.

01:43:55.748 --> 01:43:57.572
MARISHA: Right, because if
we put-- there was the idea

01:43:57.573 --> 01:44:00.364
of floating the intuit charges.

01:44:00.365 --> 01:44:02.744
TRAVIS: Sidebar, what do we
think they're looking for?

01:44:02.745 --> 01:44:05.114
Not that I don't love talking
about this booby trap.

01:44:05.115 --> 01:44:06.474
What do we think they're
looking for when they get here?

01:44:06.475 --> 01:44:07.570
Where are they going?

01:44:07.571 --> 01:44:08.584
Have we figured that out yet?

01:44:08.585 --> 01:44:10.457
LIAM: They have a place to cross over.

01:44:10.458 --> 01:44:12.363
TRAVIS: And we haven't figured
that out where that is?

01:44:12.364 --> 01:44:13.197
ALL: No.

01:44:13.198 --> 01:44:14.324
TRAVIS: We don't know if
it's left, straight, right?

01:44:14.325 --> 01:44:17.094
Why aren't we trying to
fly above this thing

01:44:17.095 --> 01:44:17.928
and see something?

01:44:17.929 --> 01:44:20.514
Because we're afraid of
something jumping out?

01:44:20.515 --> 01:44:22.294
We're going to have to
take risk at some point.

01:44:22.295 --> 01:44:24.354
TALIESIN: I'd say flight
is the way-- I agree.

01:44:24.355 --> 01:44:26.954
TRAVIS: I would fly, but
I've done it already.

01:44:26.955 --> 01:44:29.014
SAM: Flying to just around <i>this</i> area?

01:44:29.015 --> 01:44:29.848
This is not--

01:44:29.849 --> 01:44:31.264
TRAVIS: It's a massive space
with a bunch of cities--

01:44:31.265 --> 01:44:33.344
SAM: This isn't where we're going.
TRAVIS: There's got to be something that jumps out.

01:44:33.345 --> 01:44:34.439
MARISHA: Well, we--
TRAVIS: A door, a wall.

01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:36.364
A well, a hole, or something.

01:44:36.365 --> 01:44:38.524
MARISHA: I'm assuming that
we have to cut through here

01:44:38.525 --> 01:44:41.314
in order to get to the empty blank space

01:44:41.315 --> 01:44:42.759
where they're trying to get to.

01:44:42.760 --> 01:44:44.172
SAM: We can look--

01:44:44.173 --> 01:44:45.534
sorry, Fjord, are we looking around

01:44:45.535 --> 01:44:47.274
for an ambush point in this city?

01:44:47.275 --> 01:44:50.024
Or are we looking for
the Somnovem place?

01:44:50.025 --> 01:44:53.054
TRAVIS: Anything, features, where
else they might be coming from,

01:44:53.055 --> 01:44:55.144
where they might go to,
things that we could utilize.

01:44:55.145 --> 01:44:57.372
If we know which direction
they're going to head in,

01:44:57.373 --> 01:44:59.144
then we can check to see if
there is another choke point

01:44:59.145 --> 01:45:01.774
that's not the one in the beginning.

01:45:01.775 --> 01:45:03.344
LAURA: It's spending time exploring.

01:45:03.345 --> 01:45:04.744
That's the only thing, we're spending

01:45:04.745 --> 01:45:05.725
all this time exploring.

01:45:05.726 --> 01:45:08.214
If we can set the sigil, set the trap,

01:45:08.215 --> 01:45:13.214
maybe take a long rest,
and hopefully, you know,

01:45:13.215 --> 01:45:16.524
get our stuff back in that eight hours

01:45:16.525 --> 01:45:18.784
before they get here,
then we'll be fresh.

01:45:18.785 --> 01:45:20.444
Or we can spend all the time looking

01:45:20.445 --> 01:45:24.508
for another ambush point, and
definitely won't be fresh.

01:45:26.222 --> 01:45:27.504
MARISHA: I think we're all
on the same page.

01:45:27.505 --> 01:45:29.694
LIAM: There could be
seven different exits

01:45:29.695 --> 01:45:32.314
from this chamber that
the city is inside of.

01:45:32.315 --> 01:45:35.234
So we might not find <i>the</i> way,
there could be many options.

01:45:35.235 --> 01:45:39.574
We could turn my cat into
some sort of-- like a bat

01:45:39.575 --> 01:45:42.384
or some kind of flying creature
to just do a circle

01:45:42.385 --> 01:45:45.814
to get the lay of the land here,
or one of us could do it.

01:45:45.815 --> 01:45:47.414
ASHLEY: Yeah, I gladly can do it.

01:45:47.415 --> 01:45:50.934
I just want to make sure we
all know what we're doing.

01:45:50.935 --> 01:45:53.254
LIAM: I'm curious what these
blue and green things are.

01:45:53.255 --> 01:45:54.411
I think we should--

01:45:54.412 --> 01:45:55.417
MARISHA: I don't know.

01:45:55.418 --> 01:45:56.644
LAURA: I don't think we should-- yeah.

01:45:56.645 --> 01:45:58.284
LIAM: I'm not saying we all go over,

01:45:58.285 --> 01:46:02.004
but I think sending my cat to
take a look is not a bad idea.

01:46:02.005 --> 01:46:03.070
TALIESIN: I think having a cat
just take a look.

01:46:03.071 --> 01:46:05.000
ASHLEY: He could check the lights and--

01:46:05.001 --> 01:46:06.224
LAURA: And then somebody fly up--

01:46:06.225 --> 01:46:09.217
ASHLEY: I can do a look around.

01:46:09.218 --> 01:46:10.574
TALIESIN: All right.
SAM: You can fly for 10 minutes?

01:46:10.575 --> 01:46:12.434
One minute?
ASHLEY: I can fly for one minute.

01:46:12.435 --> 01:46:13.450
LAURA: Great.
SAM: Okay.

01:46:13.451 --> 01:46:15.566
ASHLEY: So I can-- sure I
can see a lot in a minute.

01:46:15.567 --> 01:46:17.664
MARISHA: Are you sure you
don't want to save that

01:46:17.665 --> 01:46:19.244
in case shit hits the fan?

01:46:19.245 --> 01:46:20.994
ASHLEY: I mean, the
reason I like saving it

01:46:20.995 --> 01:46:24.348
is because when I do it,
you can do extra damage.

01:46:24.349 --> 01:46:25.185
LAURA: Then don't use it.

01:46:25.186 --> 01:46:26.674
ASHLEY: But--
MARISHA: Yeah, save it, save it.

01:46:26.675 --> 01:46:29.416
ASHLEY: But I mean,
it's also, it takes--

01:46:30.441 --> 01:46:33.606
it takes an action to do it, so.

01:46:33.607 --> 01:46:34.684
TRAVIS: No, save it.
LAURA: Save it.

01:46:34.685 --> 01:46:36.414
It's only for a minute, you're not
going to be able to explore.

01:46:36.415 --> 01:46:38.154
I have no more Polymorphs, I've used up

01:46:38.155 --> 01:46:39.075
all my 4th-level spells.

01:46:39.076 --> 01:46:41.644
LIAM: One safe way to do
it-- are you prepared

01:46:41.645 --> 01:46:43.194
to make yourself invisible right now?

01:46:43.195 --> 01:46:44.754
SAM: Sure, I can just run around.

01:46:44.755 --> 01:46:47.374
LIAM: No, I could make you
fly while you're invisible.

01:46:47.375 --> 01:46:48.208
SAM: Okay, or that.

01:46:48.209 --> 01:46:50.154
LIAM: You could quietly
fly all over the place.

01:46:50.155 --> 01:46:52.734
You're the person who is the quietest.

01:46:52.735 --> 01:46:54.407
MARISHA: I'd honestly trust
that more than your cat.

01:46:54.408 --> 01:46:56.054
No offense.
LAURA: Yeah.

01:46:56.055 --> 01:46:57.845
Plus Nott can put on the goggles,

01:46:57.846 --> 01:46:59.837
get good perception.
LIAM: Absolutely.

01:46:59.838 --> 01:47:03.134
SAM: I'm not the most perceptive person.
LAURA: Well, you're better than the cat.

01:47:03.135 --> 01:47:03.968
Let's be honest.

01:47:03.969 --> 01:47:05.273
SAM: Okay, if anyone can
boost my perception--

01:47:05.274 --> 01:47:06.604
LIAM: Aren't you great at investigating?

01:47:06.605 --> 01:47:07.754
SAM: Investigating.

01:47:07.755 --> 01:47:08.615
LIAM: That's what you're doing.

01:47:08.616 --> 01:47:11.214
SAM: No, I'm perceiving from the sky.

01:47:11.215 --> 01:47:13.314
ASHLEY: Are we resting here
or we're going to keep going?

01:47:13.315 --> 01:47:14.974
LAURA: We don't know.
ASHLEY: We don't know yet.

01:47:14.975 --> 01:47:17.194
MATT: It's an hour-long short rest,
so this conversation,

01:47:17.195 --> 01:47:18.795
I'm assuming, is happening
during that hour.

01:47:18.796 --> 01:47:21.264
There's still time of the hour.

01:47:21.265 --> 01:47:22.098
MARISHA: Okay.

01:47:22.099 --> 01:47:24.954
SAM: Our most perceptive
person is Caduceus.

01:47:24.955 --> 01:47:26.374
ASHLEY: I'm pretty perceptive.

01:47:26.375 --> 01:47:29.684
SAM: I can probably make him-- or Yasha.

01:47:29.685 --> 01:47:30.535
Either one.

01:47:30.536 --> 01:47:33.874
I can turn them invisible
and you can make them fly.

01:47:33.875 --> 01:47:35.194
LIAM: Who can be--

01:47:35.195 --> 01:47:36.924
LAURA: Quiet?
LIAM: Quiet also.

01:47:36.925 --> 01:47:39.064
MARISHA: Right, which is why
we couldn't even just have

01:47:39.065 --> 01:47:41.659
like a stealth duo go
out and normal scout--

01:47:41.660 --> 01:47:43.488
LAURA: No, we need a fly.

01:47:43.489 --> 01:47:44.881
SAM: I'll touch--
LIAM: Fly, for the big picture.

01:47:44.882 --> 01:47:46.524
SAM: I'll touch Yasha,
I'll make her invisible.

01:47:46.525 --> 01:47:48.306
You touch her, make her fly,
then she can

01:47:48.307 --> 01:47:49.422
go all over the place.
LAURA: Be quiet as fuck, Yasha,

01:47:49.423 --> 01:47:50.256
go find something.

01:47:50.257 --> 01:47:51.441
TRAVIS: We need a drone,
we need a drone.

01:47:51.442 --> 01:47:54.674
ASHLEY: We all know that
I am very quiet.

01:47:54.675 --> 01:47:57.169
History has--
LIAM: Are you?

01:47:57.170 --> 01:47:58.740
SAM: Or Caduceus, how's your stealth?

01:47:58.741 --> 01:48:00.677
ASHLEY: Pretty quiet.

01:48:00.678 --> 01:48:02.359
(laughter)

01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:03.544
TALIESIN: (uncertain noises)

01:48:03.545 --> 01:48:07.794
SAM: So it's either me and you
get total great stealth,

01:48:07.795 --> 01:48:08.628
but lousy perception.

01:48:08.629 --> 01:48:09.844
LIAM: You're pretty good stealth, right?

01:48:09.845 --> 01:48:11.374
MARISHA: My perception's okay.

01:48:11.375 --> 01:48:13.034
My investigation's better.

01:48:13.035 --> 01:48:16.530
My perception's okay and
my stealth is plus 10.

01:48:16.531 --> 01:48:18.804
ASHLEY: Perception is plus 10?
MARISHA: No, my stealth is.

01:48:18.805 --> 01:48:20.294
LIAM: That's great.
MARISHA: Perception plus four.

01:48:20.295 --> 01:48:21.128
TALIESIN: I vote cat.

01:48:21.129 --> 01:48:22.476
Does anybody else have a--
LAURA: No.

01:48:22.477 --> 01:48:23.421
TALIESIN: Never mind.

01:48:23.421 --> 01:48:24.379
LIAM: The cat can't see.

01:48:24.380 --> 01:48:26.464
The cat's supposed to go look
at a light and that's it.

01:48:26.465 --> 01:48:28.390
ASHLEY: One.
LAURA: Fuck.

01:48:28.391 --> 01:48:30.074
What's your stealth, Yasha?

01:48:30.075 --> 01:48:31.414
ASHLEY: Plus three.

01:48:31.415 --> 01:48:32.665
LAURA: And your perception is--?

01:48:33.875 --> 01:48:34.708
ASHLEY: Plus five.

01:48:34.709 --> 01:48:36.953
LAURA: Oh.
TRAVIS: Wow!

01:48:36.954 --> 01:48:38.700
Way better than me.

01:48:38.701 --> 01:48:39.954
SAM: What about Beau?
LIAM: Yeah.

01:48:39.955 --> 01:48:42.384
SAM: She's got pretty good
perception, pretty good stealth.

01:48:42.385 --> 01:48:43.538
LIAM: She got a Bless.

01:48:44.575 --> 01:48:45.684
LAURA: Yeah.

01:48:45.685 --> 01:48:47.524
TALIESIN: I'm a 10-five, 10 perception.

01:48:47.525 --> 01:48:50.324
LAURA: Oh, well then Caduceus is--
SAM: Oh, that's fucking amazing.

01:48:50.325 --> 01:48:51.524
That's even better.

01:48:51.525 --> 01:48:53.676
MARISHA: 10 perception, five stealth?
TALIESIN: Yeah, all right.

01:48:53.677 --> 01:48:54.659
SAM: That's pretty good.

01:48:54.660 --> 01:48:56.244
TRAVIS: What the fuck
are you talking about?

01:48:56.245 --> 01:48:57.534
Are you nuts?

01:48:57.535 --> 01:48:59.017
That's amazing!

01:48:59.018 --> 01:49:01.626
ASHLEY: Get out there, go.
LAURA: Let's get Caduceus out, fly around.

01:49:01.627 --> 01:49:04.354
TRAVIS: I'm at a three and
a one over here. (laughs)

01:49:04.355 --> 01:49:05.188
Or two.

01:49:05.188 --> 01:49:06.165
TALIESIN: This is what
I'm good at, apparently.

01:49:06.166 --> 01:49:07.394
All right, I'll take a look around.

01:49:07.395 --> 01:49:09.381
SAM: All right, I will make you--
TALIESIN: I'll need the goggles.

01:49:09.382 --> 01:49:11.059
ASHLEY: ♪ Look around now ♪
MARISHA: All right.

01:49:11.060 --> 01:49:12.734
I toss you the goggles.
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

01:49:12.735 --> 01:49:14.444
SAM: I will make you invisible.

01:49:14.445 --> 01:49:16.924
MARISHA: Don't stretch out the
elastic, like, adjust it a little,

01:49:16.925 --> 01:49:18.334
your head's a lot-- aww.

01:49:18.335 --> 01:49:20.684
MATT: I recommend casting the
Fly spell before Invisibility,

01:49:20.685 --> 01:49:21.846
since you have to see the target.

01:49:21.847 --> 01:49:23.311
SAM: Sure.

01:49:23.312 --> 01:49:25.614
LAURA: Okay, wait, and
then before Invisibility,

01:49:25.615 --> 01:49:30.615
I'll waste a spell as well
and cast Owl's Wisdom on you.

01:49:30.778 --> 01:49:31.625
TALIESIN: Thank you.

01:49:31.626 --> 01:49:32.664
That gives me--

01:49:32.665 --> 01:49:35.573
SAM: In every campaign,
we need at least one flying cow.

01:49:35.574 --> 01:49:37.554
(laughter)

01:49:37.555 --> 01:49:38.934
LAURA: Oh wait, perception, yeah.

01:49:38.935 --> 01:49:40.635
Advantage on any perception check.

01:49:41.935 --> 01:49:43.417
TALIESIN: All right.
MATT: Okay.

01:49:43.418 --> 01:49:44.415
LIAM: Okay.

01:49:44.416 --> 01:49:45.744
You're flying, you're invisible.

01:49:45.745 --> 01:49:46.578
You're fabulous.

01:49:46.578 --> 01:49:47.485
SAM: You've done Fly?
LIAM: Yes.

01:49:47.486 --> 01:49:48.866
SAM: I'm casting Invisibility.

01:49:48.867 --> 01:49:52.204
I will touch you in a
sort of a creepy way.

01:49:52.205 --> 01:49:54.455
TALIESIN: I will make some sound
and some light if things go wrong.

01:49:54.456 --> 01:49:56.304
TRAVIS: My sword is glowing,
so when you want to come back,

01:49:56.305 --> 01:49:57.374
that's where we are.

01:49:57.375 --> 01:49:58.208
TALIESIN: So.

01:49:58.209 --> 01:50:00.564
SAM: Wait, I want to
do this Caleb style.

01:50:00.565 --> 01:50:03.774
I take out an eyelash
and some gum arabic

01:50:03.775 --> 01:50:07.214
and smash them together
in my palms and spit in it,

01:50:07.215 --> 01:50:10.594
that's just for flavor,
and smash it on your head.

01:50:10.595 --> 01:50:12.302
Okay, you're now invisible.

01:50:13.145 --> 01:50:14.694
LAURA: I'm going to
do this Jester style.

01:50:14.695 --> 01:50:16.574
I'm going to take out my paint brush

01:50:16.575 --> 01:50:18.757
and I'm going to paint
another mustache on you.

01:50:18.758 --> 01:50:20.115
Sorry, Veth.

01:50:20.116 --> 01:50:21.171
There you go.

01:50:21.172 --> 01:50:23.601
LIAM: I cast Fly at 3rd-level.

01:50:23.602 --> 01:50:27.376
(laughter)

01:50:27.377 --> 01:50:28.984
MATT: Okay.
SAM: Perfect.

01:50:28.985 --> 01:50:31.974
MATT: Now Caduceus, your eyes
adjust to the darkvision.

01:50:31.975 --> 01:50:36.094
As you adjust to the mash
that was placed on your body

01:50:36.095 --> 01:50:39.537
by Veth, as you begin to shimmer and vanish,

01:50:39.538 --> 01:50:41.656
you can still see your
form, but you can see

01:50:41.657 --> 01:50:44.064
the somewhat translucent
energy over it

01:50:44.065 --> 01:50:45.894
as you begin to also
lift off the ground

01:50:45.895 --> 01:50:49.434
in an uncomfortable way that
you're not fully used to.

01:50:49.435 --> 01:50:52.274
TALIESIN: Like the first time
in a flight harness.

01:50:52.275 --> 01:50:54.224
MATT: Yeah, you start drifting
a little bit to one side

01:50:54.225 --> 01:50:55.504
and catch yourself, but nevertheless,

01:50:55.505 --> 01:50:58.314
you can fly invisibly
while feeling quite wise.

01:50:58.315 --> 01:50:59.648
TALIESIN: All right, let's--

01:51:00.635 --> 01:51:04.084
I'm going to head out and
start seeing if I can find--

01:51:04.085 --> 01:51:06.364
get a lay of the land,
see if I can find

01:51:06.365 --> 01:51:08.864
any of those strange
blue and green glowing lights.

01:51:08.865 --> 01:51:11.456
Not get too close,
but get a sense of them.

01:51:11.457 --> 01:51:13.279
LAURA: And look for the
entrance to the Somnovem ward.

01:51:13.280 --> 01:51:15.504
TALIESIN: Any entrances or--
SAM: And also ambush points.

01:51:15.505 --> 01:51:16.954
Choke points.

01:51:16.955 --> 01:51:18.666
TALIESIN: I don't know what
any of that is, but sure.

01:51:18.667 --> 01:51:20.272
ASHLEY: And also any snacks.
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:51:20.273 --> 01:51:21.455
TALIESIN: I know what that is.

01:51:21.456 --> 01:51:23.538
If I see snacks,
I will identify them immediately.

01:51:23.539 --> 01:51:24.954
TRAVIS: You see the Concession Ward.

01:51:24.955 --> 01:51:27.754
LAURA: Any silk robes,
any kimonos, grab 'em.

01:51:27.755 --> 01:51:30.116
TALIESIN: Silk robes.
MARISHA: Food Court Ward.

01:51:30.117 --> 01:51:32.344
TRAVIS: Oh, Panda Express, no way.
(laughter)

01:51:32.345 --> 01:51:33.978
TALIESIN: K.B. Toy store.
ASHLEY: Oh, my favorite!

01:51:33.979 --> 01:51:35.304
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: Ooh, they have Sbarro's.

01:51:35.305 --> 01:51:36.376
TRAVIS: Orange Julius!

01:51:36.377 --> 01:51:38.183
TALIESIN: Sharper Image massage
chairs so we can all get a quick--

01:51:38.184 --> 01:51:39.768
SAM: Ooh, I love those.

01:51:40.920 --> 01:51:43.494
MARISHA: 20 bucks for a
15 minute massage? Hell yeah.

01:51:43.495 --> 01:51:46.004
TALIESIN: Worst mall ever. All right.

01:51:46.005 --> 01:51:49.328
MATT: As you take off
into the air above,

01:51:51.275 --> 01:51:54.584
it's astonishing, one,
to be able to see clearly around you

01:51:54.585 --> 01:51:55.525
the neighborhood structure.

01:51:55.526 --> 01:51:57.424
You can actually see the--

01:51:57.425 --> 01:52:00.454
how the streets are arranged and almost

01:52:00.455 --> 01:52:02.034
like a capillary system
at this distance,

01:52:02.035 --> 01:52:03.544
as you pull up,
you can see what was once

01:52:03.545 --> 01:52:06.184
the close buildings
becomes what was once

01:52:06.185 --> 01:52:07.678
the thrum of a living city.

01:52:08.675 --> 01:52:11.754
All sorts of odd structures
fallen and collapsed,

01:52:11.755 --> 01:52:13.804
vehicles that are broken.

01:52:13.805 --> 01:52:15.204
The first thing that
catches your attention

01:52:15.205 --> 01:52:17.645
and the first source of a light

01:52:17.646 --> 01:52:22.437
is a pale blue light and
two green lights

01:52:22.438 --> 01:52:24.924
from within some sort of
larger circular structure,

01:52:24.925 --> 01:52:26.454
much larger than
everything else nearby.

01:52:26.455 --> 01:52:29.044
It's a few hundred feet
away from the building

01:52:29.045 --> 01:52:31.124
where everyone else is resting.

01:52:31.125 --> 01:52:33.808
Go ahead and make a perception
check for me, with advantage.

01:52:36.195 --> 01:52:37.336
TALIESIN: 25.

01:52:39.065 --> 01:52:40.739
MATT: You coast up and above it,

01:52:40.740 --> 01:52:42.372
and quickly you can make out

01:52:42.373 --> 01:52:46.390
this was some kind of amphitheater.

01:52:46.391 --> 01:52:47.224
MARISHA: Oh.

01:52:47.225 --> 01:52:50.974
MATT: You can see
a seating arrangement

01:52:50.975 --> 01:52:52.104
that descends towards the center.

01:52:52.105 --> 01:52:55.584
You can see what was
a raised dais in the center

01:52:55.585 --> 01:52:58.174
with podiums and seating spaces,

01:52:58.175 --> 01:53:00.484
though it is now partially fallen in

01:53:00.485 --> 01:53:02.144
and the podium in the center is now

01:53:02.145 --> 01:53:04.128
at an odd angle and cracked.

01:53:05.495 --> 01:53:07.244
You can see in the middle of that space

01:53:07.245 --> 01:53:11.724
is a very bright blue glow,
and that bluish-green glow

01:53:11.725 --> 01:53:13.634
you can see scattered on two different

01:53:13.635 --> 01:53:15.297
points on the ground.

01:53:15.298 --> 01:53:16.964
Do you want to get closer?

01:53:16.965 --> 01:53:19.924
TALIESIN: Let's get a little closer,
see what I can see from above.

01:53:19.925 --> 01:53:21.584
MATT: Make a stealth check.
LIAM: I'm imagining you--

01:53:21.585 --> 01:53:23.061
MATT: With advantage
because you are invisible.

01:53:23.062 --> 01:53:25.376
LIAM: -- as a firbolg owl man right now.

01:53:29.365 --> 01:53:30.198
TALIESIN: 22.

01:53:30.198 --> 01:53:31.031
MATT: 22.

01:53:33.575 --> 01:53:36.314
Silently, you coast through the air,

01:53:36.315 --> 01:53:40.423
the musty, long-left-still atmosphere

01:53:41.265 --> 01:53:42.774
catching your sinuses.

01:53:42.775 --> 01:53:45.524
As you push closer and
closer to the light,

01:53:45.525 --> 01:53:47.574
you get a glimpse down.

01:53:47.575 --> 01:53:51.514
There's this-- the pale,
greenish-blue light

01:53:51.515 --> 01:53:56.515
looks to be remaining light sources,

01:53:56.665 --> 01:53:59.434
like magical lanterns that
once lit portions of the city.

01:53:59.435 --> 01:54:01.794
Who knows if their
magic has faded over time.

01:54:01.795 --> 01:54:05.504
They don't brightly light a space here.

01:54:05.505 --> 01:54:09.394
It's almost like it's at the end of its

01:54:09.395 --> 01:54:11.944
long-held arcane lifespan,

01:54:11.945 --> 01:54:16.264
just giving this very dull, barely there

01:54:16.265 --> 01:54:18.298
outline to everything around it.

01:54:20.415 --> 01:54:23.364
The blue light is much brighter, and sit--

01:54:23.365 --> 01:54:24.305
TALIESIN: Oh, those are the green ones.

01:54:24.306 --> 01:54:28.386
MATT: That was the green-blue,
teal-turquoise lights.

01:54:28.387 --> 01:54:30.104
The blue light is much brighter and is

01:54:30.105 --> 01:54:33.944
right next to where that
podium is in the central dais.

01:54:33.945 --> 01:54:36.534
As you coast closer to that space,

01:54:36.535 --> 01:54:40.450
you can see now in this
colosseum, this amphitheater,

01:54:41.755 --> 01:54:45.084
numerous corpses, hundreds of them.

01:54:45.085 --> 01:54:48.310
This space was full when
the cataclysm came.

01:54:48.311 --> 01:54:49.804
ASHLEY: Oh.

01:54:49.805 --> 01:54:52.654
MATT: You can just see
hundreds upon hundreds

01:54:52.655 --> 01:54:55.278
of mummified bodies
thrown to the ground.

01:54:56.925 --> 01:54:58.134
Some that have fallen to the rubble,

01:54:58.135 --> 01:55:02.164
some that were struck down by
something upon their impact.

01:55:02.165 --> 01:55:05.804
But it is just this still ghost

01:55:05.805 --> 01:55:08.274
of what must've been
momentarily a chaotic scene

01:55:08.275 --> 01:55:10.294
as a populous attempted to run screaming

01:55:10.295 --> 01:55:14.514
before they were silenced
and left to drop where they stood.

01:55:14.515 --> 01:55:17.784
In the middle, you see
that bright blue light

01:55:17.785 --> 01:55:20.104
is a glowing dome, just like the one

01:55:20.105 --> 01:55:22.134
that you encountered in the ruins

01:55:22.135 --> 01:55:23.814
previously in Eiselcross.

01:55:23.815 --> 01:55:24.648
SAM: Frozen?

01:55:24.649 --> 01:55:26.394
LIAM: Like insects
frozen in amber, yeah.

01:55:26.395 --> 01:55:29.314
MATT: You aren't close
enough to get any details

01:55:29.315 --> 01:55:31.294
from the interior, you'd
have to get pretty close

01:55:31.295 --> 01:55:34.124
to that dome and inspect it,
but you could try, if you like.

01:55:34.125 --> 01:55:36.106
TALIESIN: Questions just for fun.

01:55:36.107 --> 01:55:37.947
Does Eyes of the Grave count as a spell?

01:55:37.948 --> 01:55:42.084
So if I bounce it, will I
lose flight or invisibility?

01:55:42.085 --> 01:55:43.684
MATT: Eyes of the Grave is
an ability, it is not a spell.

01:55:43.685 --> 01:55:45.403
TALIESIN: So I can just
use that and that's fine.

01:55:45.404 --> 01:55:46.237
MATT: Mm-hmm.

01:55:46.237 --> 01:55:47.070
TRAVIS: And it's your spell--

01:55:47.071 --> 01:55:49.281
TALIESIN: Just going to give it a little--

01:55:49.282 --> 01:55:52.154
I'm just going to see
if any of this stuff is iffy

01:55:52.155 --> 01:55:53.344
that I can see.
MATT: Okay.

01:55:53.345 --> 01:55:54.874
You get down within a
space where you feel like

01:55:54.875 --> 01:55:56.884
you're getting a comfortable vicinity

01:55:56.885 --> 01:55:59.338
around where you're intending to travel.

01:56:00.915 --> 01:56:01.748
Nothing.

01:56:04.795 --> 01:56:06.634
TALIESIN: Everything's quiet?

01:56:06.635 --> 01:56:07.468
MATT: Mm-hmm.

01:56:07.469 --> 01:56:08.630
TALIESIN: Nothing moving?

01:56:09.755 --> 01:56:11.464
Above me as well?

01:56:11.465 --> 01:56:13.404
MATT: Above you as well.

01:56:13.405 --> 01:56:16.244
TALIESIN: Just get a little
closer, not too close,

01:56:16.245 --> 01:56:18.564
but I want to see how--
I want to inch closer

01:56:18.565 --> 01:56:20.044
until I can get some kind of idea

01:56:20.045 --> 01:56:22.024
of what might be inside this blue dome.

01:56:22.025 --> 01:56:24.974
How close would I have to get
to actually see inside of it?

01:56:24.975 --> 01:56:26.554
MATT: You have to get right next to it.

01:56:26.555 --> 01:56:27.388
TALIESIN: Oh.

01:56:27.389 --> 01:56:29.832
MATT: Or like, at least
within five or so feet.

01:56:32.865 --> 01:56:33.775
TALIESIN: Mm.

01:56:33.776 --> 01:56:35.744
I'll slowly edge towards it to see.

01:56:35.745 --> 01:56:38.204
Nothing happened last time we saw one.

01:56:38.205 --> 01:56:40.414
I'll slowly edge towards it.
MATT: Okay.

01:56:40.415 --> 01:56:41.618
Make a perception check.

01:56:46.045 --> 01:56:46.878
TALIESIN: 28.

01:56:48.755 --> 01:56:49.588
MATT: Okay.

01:56:51.175 --> 01:56:53.317
That's pretty high.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:56:55.105 --> 01:56:57.080
MATT: Looking at the
interior of this dome,

01:56:57.081 --> 01:56:59.654
you can just make out
the shapes beyond,

01:56:59.655 --> 01:57:03.104
a singular humanoid figure.

01:57:03.105 --> 01:57:06.684
As your eyes begin to clarify
between the patterns,

01:57:06.685 --> 01:57:09.364
the still shifting patterns,

01:57:09.365 --> 01:57:11.914
like the rainbow light that
dances across an oil slick,

01:57:11.915 --> 01:57:14.894
the blue still shifts and slightly moves

01:57:14.895 --> 01:57:17.588
in its own magically-sealed dome.

01:57:18.445 --> 01:57:22.004
Glancing within this, you see

01:57:22.005 --> 01:57:25.658
a human woman in a powerful stance.

01:57:26.645 --> 01:57:30.064
Arms out in front, looks like
they are in the midst

01:57:30.065 --> 01:57:32.384
of some sort of incantation, mouth open,

01:57:32.385 --> 01:57:34.214
shouting and intent.

01:57:34.215 --> 01:57:35.685
Very, very--

01:57:37.585 --> 01:57:39.104
officious look to her.

01:57:39.105 --> 01:57:43.074
She is dressed in a multilayered,
prestigious looking cloak

01:57:43.075 --> 01:57:46.235
and mantle with details
and tethers and tassels

01:57:47.225 --> 01:57:49.764
decorated to appear of great import.

01:57:49.765 --> 01:57:52.164
Her hands in the midst of pressing

01:57:52.165 --> 01:57:56.444
the spell outward, shouting, and locked

01:57:56.445 --> 01:57:59.945
in whatever moment she last had.

01:58:01.195 --> 01:58:03.904
TALIESIN: Weird technical
question, as I back up from this.

01:58:03.905 --> 01:58:05.674
I see where she's facing and I see

01:58:05.675 --> 01:58:08.124
where she seems to be
concentrating her attention

01:58:08.125 --> 01:58:11.324
to whatever spell she was going to cast.

01:58:11.325 --> 01:58:15.188
Can I tell, looking at
the crowd, what they were afraid of?

01:58:16.085 --> 01:58:18.697
Like, can I tell from the crowd
what, like, where their--

01:58:18.698 --> 01:58:20.684
MATT: Make an investigation
check for me.

01:58:20.685 --> 01:58:21.844
TALIESIN: Mother--

01:58:21.845 --> 01:58:23.634
MATT: This is sussing out patterns.

01:58:23.635 --> 01:58:25.851
This is straight up investigation.
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's fair.

01:58:25.852 --> 01:58:28.596
TRAVIS: The woman inside that
bubble looks preserved or--

01:58:28.597 --> 01:58:29.644
MATT: What's what?

01:58:29.645 --> 01:58:31.414
TRAVIS: Does her form in
that bubble look preserved,

01:58:31.415 --> 01:58:32.854
the silhouette, or--

01:58:32.855 --> 01:58:35.554
MATT: From what he can
tell, it's preserved.

01:58:35.555 --> 01:58:37.475
Not like anything else around.

01:58:37.476 --> 01:58:38.939
LIAM: Stasis.
TALIESIN: 15.

01:58:38.940 --> 01:58:39.865
MATT: 15?

01:58:39.866 --> 01:58:41.954
TALIESIN: So it's just like trying
to get a read of the crowd.

01:58:41.955 --> 01:58:43.904
MATT: Right.
TALIESIN: What were they running from?

01:58:43.905 --> 01:58:46.654
MATT: The crowd is a bit
scattered, directionally.

01:58:46.655 --> 01:58:50.754
It looks like there was just chaos.

01:58:50.755 --> 01:58:52.594
Pandemonium.

01:58:52.595 --> 01:58:55.104
You do not get the sense
that they were running

01:58:55.105 --> 01:58:56.898
from this central figure.

01:58:58.335 --> 01:59:00.517
TALIESIN: Or that they
were facing, like--

01:59:01.585 --> 01:59:03.964
what I was hoping for was,
did it seem like she was

01:59:03.965 --> 01:59:07.114
confronting something
or confronting them?

01:59:07.115 --> 01:59:08.234
If that makes sense.

01:59:08.235 --> 01:59:10.964
It's hard to tell, I know.
MATT: It's hard to tell.

01:59:10.965 --> 01:59:11.798
It really is.

01:59:11.799 --> 01:59:13.774
TALIESIN: Man, I rolled a 15.
MATT: I know.

01:59:13.775 --> 01:59:14.608
TALIESIN: So hard.

01:59:14.609 --> 01:59:15.874
MATT: With your perception,
what you do gather

01:59:15.875 --> 01:59:20.314
is next to where the
dome is, you can see,

01:59:20.315 --> 01:59:23.244
like, there are bodies that have slumped

01:59:23.245 --> 01:59:25.254
over the edge of the dais and fallen,

01:59:25.255 --> 01:59:27.354
like just legs left up there,
but the rest of the body

01:59:27.355 --> 01:59:29.224
just rotted and fell to the ground.

01:59:29.225 --> 01:59:32.364
You do see another one of those

01:59:32.365 --> 01:59:35.127
mostly metallic humanoid figures.

01:59:35.128 --> 01:59:35.961
TALIESIN: Mm.

01:59:35.962 --> 01:59:37.374
MATT: This one much more intact.

01:59:37.375 --> 01:59:38.654
Though it looks like one of its legs

01:59:38.655 --> 01:59:40.826
is heavily damaged and shredded.

01:59:42.065 --> 01:59:44.694
You can see its chest is partially
pulled open in the front,

01:59:44.695 --> 01:59:47.414
but its head is intact to its shoulders,

01:59:47.415 --> 01:59:50.554
its arms are intact, and it looks like

01:59:50.555 --> 01:59:53.840
it has some decoration to it.

01:59:55.115 --> 01:59:58.064
Something that connects the decoration

01:59:58.065 --> 01:59:59.334
between the figure in the dome

01:59:59.335 --> 02:00:03.024
and this particular mechanical being.

02:00:03.025 --> 02:00:04.534
TALIESIN: Huh.

02:00:04.535 --> 02:00:07.001
Well, I'm going to pull back
for a little while now,

02:00:07.002 --> 02:00:10.874
and I'm going to try and
just do a lazy sweep

02:00:10.875 --> 02:00:13.884
to see if there's anything
that appears to be an exit

02:00:13.885 --> 02:00:17.034
from this city or any
other important building.

02:00:17.035 --> 02:00:18.704
I know how much time I have.

02:00:18.705 --> 02:00:19.734
MATT: Okay.

02:00:19.735 --> 02:00:20.851
You began to coast around.

02:00:20.852 --> 02:00:22.714
The Fly lasts for how long?

02:00:22.715 --> 02:00:24.456
LIAM: An hour.
MATT: An hour, okay.

02:00:24.457 --> 02:00:26.674
Invisibility lasts for
an hour as well, I believe?

02:00:26.675 --> 02:00:27.815
And her spell last for an hour.

02:00:27.816 --> 02:00:29.184
LIAM: No, sorry, 10 minutes.

02:00:29.185 --> 02:00:30.411
MATT: I was going to say,
10 minutes, then.

02:00:30.412 --> 02:00:32.584
So you've been here--

02:00:32.585 --> 02:00:34.154
You've been out there for
about six or so minutes.

02:00:34.155 --> 02:00:34.988
So you--

02:00:34.989 --> 02:00:36.344
TALIESIN: Do I start to feel it go, or--?

02:00:36.345 --> 02:00:38.374
MATT: No, but you're quietly counting,

02:00:38.375 --> 02:00:40.904
and knowing that you only
have 10 minutes, you're--

02:00:40.905 --> 02:00:43.064
make an intelligence check for me.

02:00:43.065 --> 02:00:44.371
Which, by the way.

02:00:45.815 --> 02:00:48.424
Fly is-- 2nd-level spell, 2nd-level spell,

02:00:48.425 --> 02:00:49.946
Fly is a 3rd-level.
LIAM: 3rd-level spell.

02:00:49.947 --> 02:00:50.888
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

02:00:50.889 --> 02:00:52.664
All right, just checking.

02:00:52.665 --> 02:00:54.306
TALIESIN: 10.
LIAM: Great.

02:00:55.355 --> 02:00:56.713
MATT: 10, all righty.

02:00:58.058 --> 02:00:59.444
TALIESIN: 10's great for me.

02:00:59.445 --> 02:01:02.424
MATT: You probably have about
four more minutes of this.

02:01:02.425 --> 02:01:07.425
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to take a
lazy way back to the house.

02:01:07.945 --> 02:01:10.174
So I'm just going to sort of--
I'm not going to head back

02:01:10.175 --> 02:01:11.714
the way I did, I'm just going to

02:01:11.715 --> 02:01:13.894
try and take a new path
and keep an eye out

02:01:13.895 --> 02:01:15.734
for anything unusual, anything--

02:01:15.735 --> 02:01:16.884
MATT: Okay.

02:01:16.885 --> 02:01:19.324
Glancing through, there
are hallways and such

02:01:19.325 --> 02:01:23.404
that exit from the
middle of this amphitheater,

02:01:23.405 --> 02:01:25.865
themselves also lined with bodies.

02:01:27.715 --> 02:01:30.644
Eventually you find your way
back to the main thoroughfare

02:01:30.645 --> 02:01:32.614
on the exterior that leads
back to where the rest

02:01:32.615 --> 02:01:35.694
of your team awaits, and you
can glide above and head back.

02:01:35.695 --> 02:01:36.807
Is there anything else you want to do

02:01:36.808 --> 02:01:38.284
with these final minutes, or--?

02:01:38.285 --> 02:01:41.994
TALIESIN: Yeah, I want to go--
First of all, does it seem like

02:01:41.995 --> 02:01:43.524
there are tracks on
the main thoroughfare

02:01:43.525 --> 02:01:45.775
from things that have
been moving through it?

02:01:46.755 --> 02:01:48.144
MATT: You'd have to get
real close and inspect.

02:01:48.145 --> 02:01:49.810
TALIESIN: I'm going to get
real close and inspect.

02:01:49.811 --> 02:01:52.714
MATT: Go ahead and make a
perception or investigation check.

02:01:52.715 --> 02:01:54.104
TALIESIN: Why you even ask is beyond me.

02:01:54.105 --> 02:01:55.294
24.

02:01:55.295 --> 02:01:56.128
MATT: 24.

02:01:57.565 --> 02:01:59.494
There are some tracks.

02:01:59.495 --> 02:02:00.755
You can see

02:02:02.925 --> 02:02:06.458
what looks to be old,
old humanoid footprints.

02:02:08.135 --> 02:02:10.404
You know, one thing you do notice,

02:02:10.405 --> 02:02:12.604
and you guys have been
here a little bit,

02:02:12.605 --> 02:02:14.714
but you're noticing it more
the further in you go,

02:02:14.715 --> 02:02:16.994
the cold seems to dissipate compared

02:02:16.995 --> 02:02:21.144
to where it was previously,
like the ruin itself

02:02:21.145 --> 02:02:23.944
has a warmer atmosphere.
MARISHA: Central heat?

02:02:23.945 --> 02:02:25.254
MATT: Kind of.

02:02:25.255 --> 02:02:29.004
Or at least, whatever cold
temperatures beset Eiselcross

02:02:29.005 --> 02:02:31.114
don't pierce quite as
deep as this ruin is.

02:02:31.115 --> 02:02:34.054
You're uncertain as to
which is the cause for this,

02:02:34.055 --> 02:02:36.255
but where the entire arrival here

02:02:36.256 --> 02:02:38.430
was dusted with frost and ice,

02:02:38.431 --> 02:02:43.431
this subzero winterscape.

02:02:43.595 --> 02:02:46.374
This ruin, the ice is slowly dissipating

02:02:46.375 --> 02:02:47.874
the further in you go,
and this amphitheater

02:02:47.875 --> 02:02:51.984
only has a coldish energy to it,
but no real ice.

02:02:51.985 --> 02:02:54.335
So it's easier for you
to see these footprints,

02:02:55.955 --> 02:02:59.614
but unable to tell how recent
they would be, necessarily.

02:02:59.615 --> 02:03:01.414
There are--
TALIESIN: Inhuman ones.

02:03:01.415 --> 02:03:02.964
MATT: There are a few inhuman ones.

02:03:02.965 --> 02:03:04.334
TALIESIN: Monstery looking things?
MATT: Yeah.

02:03:04.335 --> 02:03:06.794
But you're uncertain how old they are.

02:03:06.795 --> 02:03:08.374
You've encountered
creatures, so you know

02:03:08.375 --> 02:03:11.364
other creatures live here,
whether they be Aeorian

02:03:11.365 --> 02:03:16.084
in original origin or not,
but you're uncertain.

02:03:16.085 --> 02:03:20.474
TALIESIN: I'm going to gently take
a path off the main thoroughfare,

02:03:20.475 --> 02:03:24.044
looking through--
I'm going to take my path

02:03:24.045 --> 02:03:26.134
back to the house off
the main thoroughfare

02:03:26.135 --> 02:03:30.544
just at roof level, just to sort of see

02:03:30.545 --> 02:03:33.154
what this place looks like

02:03:33.155 --> 02:03:35.190
from just a bird's eye view, not a--

02:03:35.191 --> 02:03:37.444
LAURA: Did you get a high vantage point, too?

02:03:37.445 --> 02:03:38.355
Like--
TALIESIN: I did.

02:03:38.356 --> 02:03:39.801
LAURA: You already went high up?

02:03:39.802 --> 02:03:40.844
Okay.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:03:40.845 --> 02:03:43.319
MATT: And you guys saw some of
the neighborhoods in this space,

02:03:43.320 --> 02:03:46.234
and there are larger,
officious looking buildings.

02:03:46.235 --> 02:03:49.824
Some that are still intact,
many that are fallen in.

02:03:49.825 --> 02:03:53.444
Even at this distance,
even with your great perception,

02:03:53.445 --> 02:03:55.764
the only light that you can
go by beyond the darkvision's

02:03:55.765 --> 02:03:59.094
60-foot radius is whatever
very faint light is emanated

02:03:59.095 --> 02:04:01.244
from these blue and blue-green
dots around there.

02:04:01.245 --> 02:04:03.504
So you can just make out basic shapes.

02:04:03.505 --> 02:04:04.804
You can't get a full lay of this

02:04:04.805 --> 02:04:06.678
mostly dark terrain, unfortunately.

02:04:07.795 --> 02:04:10.684
But you take in the shape
and you get a basic idea

02:04:10.685 --> 02:04:13.624
of what this looks like,
and to your credit

02:04:13.625 --> 02:04:15.414
and the high perception
rate, you gather,

02:04:15.415 --> 02:04:18.094
getting a better perspective
for the depth,

02:04:18.095 --> 02:04:19.427
this is probably about
a hundred, I'm sorry,

02:04:19.428 --> 02:04:21.974
1,500 to close 2000 feet across

02:04:21.975 --> 02:04:24.488
before this chamber's other wall comes to a close.

02:04:25.805 --> 02:04:27.120
TALIESIN: And I haven't
seen any exits other than

02:04:27.121 --> 02:04:29.484
the one we got through in the chamber?
MATT: Mm-mm.

02:04:29.485 --> 02:04:31.094
You can't even see the
other wall, either.

02:04:31.095 --> 02:04:32.134
You can't see any other exits,

02:04:32.135 --> 02:04:33.664
because all you can see
is a neighborhood.

02:04:33.665 --> 02:04:36.154
You are too far away from any
side to see where it ends.

02:04:36.155 --> 02:04:38.634
If this is the end of it,
if it continues on,

02:04:38.635 --> 02:04:40.684
you just know that
that's where you think

02:04:40.685 --> 02:04:42.964
the next sign of a wall may be.

02:04:42.965 --> 02:04:44.084
TALIESIN: Gotcha.

02:04:44.085 --> 02:04:46.274
All right, I'm just
going to take a careful look

02:04:46.275 --> 02:04:48.198
through that neighborhood and through the--
SAM: ♪ Takin' a look! ♪

02:04:48.199 --> 02:04:49.547
TALIESIN: -- back alleys and then head home.

02:04:49.548 --> 02:04:51.364
MATT: Okay. You're getting close.

02:04:55.975 --> 02:04:59.664
You are cruising back
towards where your friends

02:04:59.665 --> 02:05:02.338
are awaiting you,
and as you are drifting,

02:05:03.755 --> 02:05:05.604
you fall the last 15 feet.

02:05:05.605 --> 02:05:08.904
You did not quite time the
end of the spell properly.

02:05:08.905 --> 02:05:10.444
TALIESIN: Is the flight
or the invisibility?

02:05:10.445 --> 02:05:11.278
MATT: The flight.

02:05:12.407 --> 02:05:14.504
TRAVIS: That was that old
intelligence 10 roll.

02:05:14.505 --> 02:05:15.755
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: Unfortunately.

02:05:17.562 --> 02:05:18.495
TRAVIS: You're good, you're good,
tuck and roll.

02:05:18.496 --> 02:05:20.654
MATT: You take two points
of bludgeoning damage.

02:05:20.655 --> 02:05:22.294
It's a small fall.
TALIESIN: Ankles, knees, hips.

02:05:22.295 --> 02:05:24.804
MATT: But you like go from
this graceful (whooshing)

02:05:24.805 --> 02:05:26.644
to (grunting) onto the ground

02:05:26.645 --> 02:05:28.674
and catch yourself a bit.

02:05:28.675 --> 02:05:31.134
TALIESIN: Put my back towards
the wall, look around to see

02:05:31.135 --> 02:05:33.444
if anything was irritated by that.

02:05:33.445 --> 02:05:34.508
MATT: Perception check.

02:05:36.576 --> 02:05:37.575
TALIESIN: 26.

02:05:37.575 --> 02:05:38.408
MATT: 26.

02:05:40.405 --> 02:05:41.944
Nothing.

02:05:41.945 --> 02:05:42.778
You think.

02:05:44.215 --> 02:05:45.535
TALIESIN: I'm going to--

02:05:46.775 --> 02:05:48.125
I'm still invisible, right?

02:05:49.005 --> 02:05:49.838
MATT: You are still invisible, yes.

02:05:49.839 --> 02:05:52.204
TALIESIN: I'm going to very gently
make my way back to the house.

02:05:52.205 --> 02:05:54.224
MATT: Make a stealth check
for me, please.

02:05:54.225 --> 02:05:55.058
With advantage.

02:05:58.435 --> 02:05:59.375
TALIESIN: Goddamn.

02:05:59.376 --> 02:06:01.757
Where are these rolls when I'm fighting?

02:06:01.758 --> 02:06:02.591
22.

02:06:02.591 --> 02:06:03.538
MATT: 22, okay.

02:06:04.455 --> 02:06:06.384
Gingerly, you make your way
through the streets,

02:06:06.385 --> 02:06:09.284
avoiding loose rubble and anything

02:06:09.285 --> 02:06:11.124
that might give away your location

02:06:11.125 --> 02:06:13.174
if tumbled into or passed.

02:06:13.175 --> 02:06:15.064
Quietly, you eventually approach Fjord,

02:06:15.065 --> 02:06:16.865
who's keeping watch on the exterior,

02:06:17.825 --> 02:06:19.975
and you meet up with
the rest of your team.

02:06:21.425 --> 02:06:22.444
TALIEISN: See anything?

02:06:22.445 --> 02:06:24.539
TRAVIS: (startled noise)

02:06:24.540 --> 02:06:26.265
TALIESIN: Shouldn't do that,
we're trying to be stealthy.

02:06:27.556 --> 02:06:29.284
TRAVIS: Caduceus?

02:06:29.285 --> 02:06:30.135
TALIESIN: Hmm?

02:06:30.136 --> 02:06:31.434
TRAVIS: You're still invisible.

02:06:31.435 --> 02:06:32.268
TALIEISN: Oh, yeah.

02:06:32.269 --> 02:06:34.408
I mean, it seems like
the smart thing to do.

02:06:35.325 --> 02:06:36.975
TRAVIS: Can you drop your invisibility?

02:06:37.915 --> 02:06:39.084
TALIESIN: I don't know, actually.

02:06:39.085 --> 02:06:39.918
I'm not sure if I can.

02:06:39.919 --> 02:06:41.794
TRAVIS: Caduceus is back.

02:06:41.795 --> 02:06:43.608
TALIESIN: I don't know
if I want to find out.

02:06:45.145 --> 02:06:46.229
I think I'll just enjoy
this for a little while.

02:06:46.230 --> 02:06:47.734
SAM: What'd you find out?

02:06:47.735 --> 02:06:48.735
TALIESIN: Well, and I--

02:06:48.736 --> 02:06:50.085
LAURA: We say, as the door opens.

02:06:50.086 --> 02:06:51.543
MATT: Mm-hmm. (creaking)

02:06:51.544 --> 02:06:52.959
TALIESIN: (lip trilling)

02:06:52.960 --> 02:06:54.224
And that's what I saw.

02:06:54.225 --> 02:06:56.264
SAM: So--
LAURA: Wow, we need that lady.

02:06:56.265 --> 02:06:57.504
She sounds powerful.

02:06:57.505 --> 02:06:58.714
TRAVIS: We've seen
that blue dome before,

02:06:58.715 --> 02:07:02.004
but did we try to dispel it,
or cure it, or break it, or--?

02:07:02.005 --> 02:07:03.902
LAURA: I don't think
we tried to dispel it.

02:07:03.903 --> 02:07:04.855
SAM: I think we tried
to hit it, didn't we?

02:07:04.856 --> 02:07:07.654
MARISHA: You tried to
with your Judge, right?

02:07:07.655 --> 02:07:08.595
Magician's Judge?

02:07:08.596 --> 02:07:11.134
LAURA: Oh, that's right.
SAM: (mumbled) Magician's Judge.

02:07:11.135 --> 02:07:13.674
ASHLEY: I can't remember if
we tried to dispel it or not.

02:07:13.675 --> 02:07:15.614
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right.
LAURA: Oh, it's solid.

02:07:15.615 --> 02:07:18.404
MARISHA: And the people that
we saw in the bubble before,

02:07:18.405 --> 02:07:21.944
were they also wearing
fancy robes and looked nice?

02:07:21.945 --> 02:07:23.864
And looked powerful?
LAURA: They looked mid-run.

02:07:23.865 --> 02:07:24.865
They didn't look like they were like--

02:07:24.865 --> 02:07:25.698
MARISHA: Yeah, they were running.

02:07:25.698 --> 02:07:26.531
MATT: They were running, it looked like.

02:07:26.532 --> 02:07:28.069
LAURA: Somebody else cast
it on them or something.

02:07:28.070 --> 02:07:28.903
TRAVIS: Oh, that's true, yeah.

02:07:28.904 --> 02:07:33.397
LIAM: It's probably just
whoever is within the radius.

02:07:33.398 --> 02:07:34.235
TRAVIS: It's not like,

02:07:34.236 --> 02:07:37.334
"I'm going to jump forward
2000 years in time" bubble.

02:07:37.335 --> 02:07:39.284
Somebody else shot a (foomph).
LIAM: It's just a quick

02:07:39.285 --> 02:07:42.454
emergency action from a
high-level caster, probably.

02:07:42.455 --> 02:07:44.304
MARISHA: Unless this is some
sort of weird side effect

02:07:44.305 --> 02:07:48.074
of the beacon that we
assume was maybe here

02:07:48.075 --> 02:07:51.784
vanishing, keeping them in
some sort of protective stasis

02:07:51.785 --> 02:07:53.054
for those that are consecuted?

02:07:53.055 --> 02:07:55.541
LAURA: Guys, I know this is
really important to talk about,

02:07:55.542 --> 02:07:56.949
but we also--

02:07:56.950 --> 02:07:58.282
SAM: Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this?

02:07:58.283 --> 02:07:59.830
What's this?
LAURA: Because I'm doing secretive.

02:07:59.831 --> 02:08:01.344
SAM: Oh, okay.

02:08:01.345 --> 02:08:04.554
LAURA: We also need to
eat a Heroes' Feast.

02:08:04.555 --> 02:08:05.388
MARISHA: Oh yeah.

02:08:05.388 --> 02:08:06.315
TALIESIN: So.
MARISHA: Okay.

02:08:06.316 --> 02:08:07.814
LAURA: It takes an hour to consume!

02:08:07.815 --> 02:08:09.364
MARISHA: I have a plan.
TRAVIS: And lasts how long?

02:08:09.365 --> 02:08:11.094
LAURA: 24 hours.

02:08:11.095 --> 02:08:12.404
TRAVIS: Okay.
MARISHA: Can I pitch my plan?

02:08:12.405 --> 02:08:13.238
LAURA: Okay.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:08:13.239 --> 02:08:15.524
LAURA: Yes.
MARISHA: Okay.

02:08:15.525 --> 02:08:16.925
SAM: Before you pitch:

02:08:17.875 --> 02:08:19.782
Caduceus, wherever you are in the room,

02:08:19.783 --> 02:08:22.244
you saw no exits of the city?

02:08:22.245 --> 02:08:23.534
TALIESIN: No.

02:08:23.535 --> 02:08:25.954
SAM: Okay. No good ambush points?

02:08:25.955 --> 02:08:27.084
TALIESIN: I don't know
what that would be.

02:08:27.085 --> 02:08:29.118
TRAVIS: You made it to the
other end of the cavern?

02:08:30.275 --> 02:08:31.744
TALIESIN: There wasn't enough time,

02:08:31.745 --> 02:08:34.704
but I saw where the cavern ended.

02:08:34.705 --> 02:08:37.974
I just couldn't get a
good look at it, but--

02:08:37.975 --> 02:08:40.084
SAM: Okay, what's your pitch?
What's your pitch?

02:08:40.085 --> 02:08:43.104
MARISHA: Okay, we know Caduceus is--
not-- you're Caduceus.

02:08:43.105 --> 02:08:44.274
Oh lord.

02:08:44.275 --> 02:08:47.524
We know Lucien's end game, and that is

02:08:47.525 --> 02:08:49.034
to get to wherever he's going.

02:08:49.035 --> 02:08:51.954
We don't know much more past this point

02:08:51.955 --> 02:08:53.894
of the direction of how to get there.

02:08:53.895 --> 02:08:57.324
We put the intuit charges up under

02:08:57.325 --> 02:08:58.654
to where they're floating.

02:08:58.655 --> 02:09:03.655
Have that ambush point in the
chamber that we talked about.

02:09:03.705 --> 02:09:07.144
Your sigil on the ground,
hopefully intuit charges poof,

02:09:07.145 --> 02:09:10.374
they fall, hit your sigil, we ambush.

02:09:10.375 --> 02:09:13.804
We have this spot here
as our fallback place.

02:09:13.805 --> 02:09:16.204
If we, things were starting to go bad,

02:09:16.205 --> 02:09:17.524
we can just keep pulling back,

02:09:17.525 --> 02:09:20.294
maybe even keeping them at the distance,

02:09:20.295 --> 02:09:23.344
kiting them, fighting them
at a distance as much as we can,

02:09:23.345 --> 02:09:25.594
we can fall back here, try and hide,

02:09:25.595 --> 02:09:27.054
and hopefully they don't see us,

02:09:27.055 --> 02:09:29.754
and then maybe we can reverse the tides

02:09:29.755 --> 02:09:32.564
to where if they decide to keep moving,

02:09:32.565 --> 02:09:35.165
then we can be the ones that
are following for once.

02:09:36.455 --> 02:09:38.604
LIAM: There's one technical issue.

02:09:38.605 --> 02:09:41.454
The charges do not float any higher

02:09:41.455 --> 02:09:42.844
than three feet off the ground.

02:09:42.845 --> 02:09:45.204
So they can't float over the lip.

02:09:45.205 --> 02:09:48.194
They'd have to be in that passage

02:09:48.195 --> 02:09:51.634
or what I was thinking was
at the bottom of the fall.

02:09:51.635 --> 02:09:54.774
LAURA: Oh yeah, at the very bottom
of the fall, that's good.

02:09:54.775 --> 02:09:58.024
So we put the sigil up top,
hopefully they fall.

02:09:58.025 --> 02:10:01.034
I could also put the sigil
halfway down the chamber

02:10:01.035 --> 02:10:03.784
so maybe it'll hit
a couple of them as it hits.

02:10:03.785 --> 02:10:05.084
MARISHA: Because you said it's 60 feet

02:10:05.085 --> 02:10:07.134
and it makes them incapacitated?

02:10:07.135 --> 02:10:08.474
LAURA: The one I would do, yes.

02:10:08.475 --> 02:10:10.064
MARISHA: So then they could hopefully fall.

02:10:10.065 --> 02:10:10.898
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: Take the

02:10:10.899 --> 02:10:12.310
full blast of the intuit charges.

02:10:12.311 --> 02:10:13.144
TRAVIS: Pain, right?

02:10:13.145 --> 02:10:14.233
LAURA: Pain is what I was going to use, yes.

02:10:14.234 --> 02:10:15.514
TRAVIS: And it would incapacitate them?

02:10:15.515 --> 02:10:19.904
LAURA: Yes. It incapacitates
them in excruciating pain.

02:10:19.905 --> 02:10:22.652
TRAVIS: Intuit stuns
them as well, right?

02:10:22.653 --> 02:10:24.834
MARISHA: And does a bunch of
psychic damage, right?

02:10:24.835 --> 02:10:26.238
TRAVIS: 10d10.
MARISHA: Okay.

02:10:26.239 --> 02:10:28.824
LAURA: And intuit charges
only hit the people

02:10:28.825 --> 02:10:30.334
that we want it to hit, it doesn't hit

02:10:30.335 --> 02:10:32.004
everybody within the radius?

02:10:32.005 --> 02:10:34.684
LIAM: It's psychic damage to
anyone within 60 feet.

02:10:34.685 --> 02:10:35.877
So we need to be out.

02:10:35.878 --> 02:10:37.654
SAM: I think it's within 300 feet.

02:10:37.655 --> 02:10:39.301
MATT: It's within 300 feet.

02:10:39.302 --> 02:10:40.594
LIAM: Right, yeah.

02:10:40.595 --> 02:10:42.399
TRAVIS: Yeah, the only
thing on the fallback,

02:10:42.400 --> 02:10:44.938
and just as long as
we're cognizant of it.

02:10:45.775 --> 02:10:47.894
Fleeing to this fallback
point means going up

02:10:47.895 --> 02:10:50.854
that 150-foot incline that has
a bunch of slippery checks

02:10:50.855 --> 02:10:54.054
and then jumping over a
15-foot chasm that some people

02:10:54.055 --> 02:10:57.388
may or may not do, just as
long as we're cool with that.

02:10:58.315 --> 02:11:00.104
MARISHA: You're not wrong.

02:11:00.105 --> 02:11:04.204
TRAVIS: I mean, we can also
use that T-junction as a--

02:11:04.205 --> 02:11:05.814
you know, as a fallback point.

02:11:05.815 --> 02:11:07.144
You can throw a bunch of the--

02:11:07.145 --> 02:11:08.454
people that like to
get up close and bang

02:11:08.455 --> 02:11:09.694
aren't going to have
to have a lot of fun,

02:11:09.695 --> 02:11:12.214
but people that can shoot
down a hallway can.

02:11:12.215 --> 02:11:14.704
You just have to stay away.
MARISHA: Away.

02:11:14.705 --> 02:11:17.474
LIAM: Matt, I have a
question, out of character.

02:11:17.475 --> 02:11:19.624
So I had Globe of Invulnerability

02:11:19.625 --> 02:11:20.954
before I ever got Allura's staff.

02:11:20.955 --> 02:11:22.444
Now I also have it.

02:11:22.445 --> 02:11:25.494
Would I know enough from
the spell and the staff

02:11:25.495 --> 02:11:27.644
and the intuit charges, which
I've studied for a while,

02:11:27.645 --> 02:11:31.894
if the effect of the charge
would be powerful enough

02:11:31.895 --> 02:11:34.154
to break through the protective shell

02:11:34.155 --> 02:11:36.594
of the Globe of Invulnerability?

02:11:36.595 --> 02:11:38.784
MATT: Make an arcana check for me.

02:11:38.785 --> 02:11:40.858
SAM: I have one more ambush pitch.

02:11:42.665 --> 02:11:43.933
LAURA: You do?

02:11:43.934 --> 02:11:44.767
LIAM: 18.

02:11:47.785 --> 02:11:50.754
MATT: It's an
Aeorian-sourced technology,

02:11:50.755 --> 02:11:54.258
which is beyond most
of your understanding.

02:11:56.245 --> 02:11:58.454
It is not a spell that it's emitting,

02:11:58.455 --> 02:12:01.634
though it is magical in nature.

02:12:01.635 --> 02:12:03.382
It's a gamble.
LIAM: Right.

02:12:04.912 --> 02:12:08.174
TRAVIS: Before we do your pitch,
just a point of clarification.

02:12:08.175 --> 02:12:12.004
We should really walk 300 feet
to the bottom of that tunnel,

02:12:12.005 --> 02:12:14.004
because I think it's
farther back than we think.

02:12:14.005 --> 02:12:16.694
That room was only what,
a hundred feet wide?

02:12:16.695 --> 02:12:18.174
MATT: Approximately, yeah.

02:12:18.175 --> 02:12:19.955
TRAVIS: So you're going to have to add--

02:12:22.065 --> 02:12:25.074
Yeah, 200 and 250 feet away
from that where it's not going to--

02:12:25.075 --> 02:12:28.334
TALIESIN: Which means going in to
attack them is going to be very hard.

02:12:28.335 --> 02:12:30.374
LAURA: That's why, like
the glyph, we won't even

02:12:30.375 --> 02:12:31.674
be able to take advantage of the fact

02:12:31.675 --> 02:12:33.314
that they're incapacitated.

02:12:33.315 --> 02:12:37.134
SAM: So wait, from the bottom drop point--

02:12:37.135 --> 02:12:38.754
TRAVIS: You'll get a little bit of the intuit--

02:12:38.755 --> 02:12:42.344
to like that T-intersection,
how far is that?

02:12:42.345 --> 02:12:45.084
MATT: That's about, I'd say 250 feet.

02:12:45.085 --> 02:12:45.918
SAM: Okay.

02:12:45.919 --> 02:12:49.554
And then that drop point
is the center of the room?

02:12:49.555 --> 02:12:50.388
MATT: Correct.

02:12:50.389 --> 02:12:52.425
TALIESIN: What if we
were in the mansion?

02:12:53.345 --> 02:12:54.704
SAM: That's fair.

02:12:54.705 --> 02:12:57.563
We wouldn't know what's
going on outside, though.

02:12:57.564 --> 02:12:59.174
LIAM: Or the dome.
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:12:59.175 --> 02:13:02.133
TALIESIN: Will the dome protect
us from the psychic damage?

02:13:02.134 --> 02:13:03.025
TRAVIS: Arcane Gate.

02:13:03.026 --> 02:13:04.108
SAM: It will.

02:13:05.195 --> 02:13:07.085
LIAM: I think so.
LAURA: Yeah.

02:13:07.086 --> 02:13:08.905
LIAM: It stops everything.
LAURA: You could do the--

02:13:08.906 --> 02:13:09.739
Oh my gosh!

02:13:09.739 --> 02:13:10.572
We could do that.

02:13:10.573 --> 02:13:12.345
You have the Arcane Gate.
MATT: Make an arcana check.

02:13:12.346 --> 02:13:13.225
LAURA: He has the Arcane Gate.

02:13:13.226 --> 02:13:14.910
So we could set the intuit charges,

02:13:14.911 --> 02:13:16.774
put the Arcane Gate right there,

02:13:16.775 --> 02:13:20.254
and then after it hits,
then we bamf in 300 feet.

02:13:20.255 --> 02:13:21.205
MARISHA: That's cool, too.

02:13:21.206 --> 02:13:22.437
LAURA: And just all run
through the door.

02:13:22.438 --> 02:13:23.604
TALIESIN: That's way better.

02:13:23.605 --> 02:13:24.711
MARISHA: That is cool, too.

02:13:24.712 --> 02:13:26.434
LAURA: If you have it available.
LIAM: 26.

02:13:26.435 --> 02:13:28.074
TALIESIN: We need a long rest anyway.

02:13:28.075 --> 02:13:29.354
LAURA: If we get a long rest.

02:13:29.355 --> 02:13:30.188
I don't know if we're going to.

02:13:30.189 --> 02:13:33.864
MATT: Once again, you
don't understand much

02:13:33.865 --> 02:13:36.694
of the basis of the creation
of these Aeorian devices.

02:13:36.695 --> 02:13:38.464
It is beyond any of your study,

02:13:38.465 --> 02:13:41.104
beyond just the bits
and pieces that you've seen and

02:13:41.105 --> 02:13:41.938
put together.

02:13:44.605 --> 02:13:47.204
It's very, very powerful
what these devices do,

02:13:47.205 --> 02:13:50.018
and the dome is a
powerful spell for its level.

02:13:51.945 --> 02:13:53.284
You're uncertain.

02:13:53.285 --> 02:13:54.814
LIAM: Mm-hmm.
MATT: So it's a gamble.

02:13:54.815 --> 02:13:55.874
LIAM: I was thinking the doors, too.

02:13:55.875 --> 02:13:57.184
I think the magic doors
is the way to go.

02:13:57.185 --> 02:13:59.063
MARISHA: The door's a good idea.

02:13:59.064 --> 02:13:59.897
TALIESIN: That was a great idea.

02:13:59.898 --> 02:14:01.818
TRAVIS: I'll have to do it
as soon as they hit it.

02:14:03.055 --> 02:14:04.045
Can't leave it up.

02:14:04.046 --> 02:14:05.944
LAURA: Okay, well yeah,
as soon as they hit it.

02:14:05.945 --> 02:14:07.864
TALIESIN: We'll know when it gets hit.

02:14:07.865 --> 02:14:10.094
LAURA: Will you be able
to see 300 feet away?

02:14:10.095 --> 02:14:11.760
TRAVIS: Depends if--
LAURA: Or you could hear.

02:14:11.761 --> 02:14:15.214
TRAVIS: Just depends if there's
line of sight from that point.

02:14:15.215 --> 02:14:16.394
If it turns at all, then no.

02:14:16.395 --> 02:14:19.774
But if we hear it go off or
something, it's like, ah!

02:14:19.775 --> 02:14:20.725
We run up.

02:14:20.726 --> 02:14:22.565
MATT: This hallway, it--

02:14:22.566 --> 02:14:24.984
it is in places like,
as I described before,

02:14:24.985 --> 02:14:28.354
parts are collapsed in and
there are bars halfway through.

02:14:28.355 --> 02:14:30.044
It would take a high
perception check to be able

02:14:30.045 --> 02:14:31.069
to get line of sight through it.

02:14:31.070 --> 02:14:33.964
It is a straight hall,
but a lot of it's been--

02:14:33.965 --> 02:14:36.884
a lot of it's been shoved off
its axis from the impact,

02:14:36.885 --> 02:14:38.424
it's heavily damaged.

02:14:38.425 --> 02:14:40.964
So I just will say,
you can go back and check,

02:14:40.965 --> 02:14:44.244
but it's a challenging,
challenging view.

02:14:44.245 --> 02:14:47.404
And even then, you do not have,
there's no light source,

02:14:47.405 --> 02:14:49.504
and you do not have the ability

02:14:49.505 --> 02:14:50.855
to see beyond 60 feet of darkvision, so.

02:14:50.856 --> 02:14:52.106
TRAVIS: That's right.

02:14:56.405 --> 02:14:58.514
That you can see. That's true.

02:14:58.515 --> 02:15:00.584
MARISHA: Unless we put
the intuit charges--

02:15:00.585 --> 02:15:02.414
TRAVIS: That would cancel that out.
I need to be able to see it.

02:15:02.415 --> 02:15:03.488
MARISHA: Up top, higher.

02:15:05.035 --> 02:15:06.635
TRAVIS: Like a balloon on the ceiling.

02:15:08.505 --> 02:15:10.684
TALIESIN: Could always just
tape them to the wall.

02:15:10.685 --> 02:15:12.085
MARISHA: Yeah, like almost--

02:15:13.705 --> 02:15:15.207
TRAVIS: Or we can just keep exploring.

02:15:15.208 --> 02:15:18.875
LIAM: I really want them to
go off within moments of each other

02:15:19.995 --> 02:15:21.028
to drop people.

02:15:22.685 --> 02:15:24.854
LAURA: The more we explore,
the more time we waste,

02:15:24.855 --> 02:15:25.924
the less we'll be able to rest.

02:15:25.925 --> 02:15:28.041
That's my only thing that I'm saying.

02:15:28.042 --> 02:15:29.158
TRAVIS: No, I'm with you.

02:15:30.005 --> 02:15:31.948
MARISHA: Because I would
love a Heroes' Feast.

02:15:33.055 --> 02:15:35.064
LAURA: I mean, we definitely
need to do that before.

02:15:35.065 --> 02:15:37.229
TRAVIS: Less than 12 hours
is what we have? Right?

02:15:37.230 --> 02:15:39.854
LAURA: Less than 24 is all we know.

02:15:39.855 --> 02:15:41.244
MARISHA: I mean, we could get interrupted

02:15:41.245 --> 02:15:43.369
in the middle of our night's rest.
LAURA: Again.

02:15:43.370 --> 02:15:45.085
TRAVIS: I'd love to keep looking,
but that room is huge.

02:15:45.086 --> 02:15:47.148
1000 by 1000 is nuts.
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

02:15:48.205 --> 02:15:51.194
LIAM: I think the traps
should take precedence.

02:15:51.195 --> 02:15:52.424
LAURA: Yeah.

02:15:52.425 --> 02:15:53.912
LIAM: To the Heroes' Feast,
is what I'm saying.

02:15:53.913 --> 02:15:54.987
LAURA and LIAM: Yeah.

02:15:54.988 --> 02:15:57.194
LAURA: Lay the traps,
eat the feast, go to sleep.

02:15:57.195 --> 02:15:59.654
SAM: Once the traps are
set, they just last?

02:15:59.655 --> 02:16:00.488
TRAVIS: 24 hours.

02:16:00.489 --> 02:16:01.893
SAM: 24 hours, that's pretty good.

02:16:01.894 --> 02:16:02.968
LAURA: What about the intuit charge?

02:16:02.969 --> 02:16:05.904
TRAVIS: And hers stays up, her--
LAURA: Mine is indefinite.

02:16:05.905 --> 02:16:07.084
It stays until it's triggered.

02:16:07.085 --> 02:16:09.784
SAM: The intuit charge stays for--

02:16:09.785 --> 02:16:11.231
LIAM: 24 hours, I think.
I'm going to check.

02:16:11.232 --> 02:16:12.581
LAURA: I don't think it's 24 hours.

02:16:12.582 --> 02:16:14.394
LIAM: Well, I'm going to read it.
SAM: It's 24--

02:16:14.395 --> 02:16:15.228
Wait.

02:16:17.035 --> 02:16:18.384
TALIESIN: You've made us nervous.

02:16:18.385 --> 02:16:20.839
Well done, Matt.
TRAVIS: Who's nervous?

02:16:20.840 --> 02:16:22.914
TALIESIN: Made us so nervous.

02:16:22.915 --> 02:16:24.824
MARISHA: I keep catching
myself like holding my breath.

02:16:24.825 --> 02:16:25.675
SAM: It's just armed.

02:16:25.676 --> 02:16:27.314
LIAM: Arms itself in one minute.

02:16:27.315 --> 02:16:28.765
Oh, in one minute.
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

02:16:30.125 --> 02:16:31.284
So you can get away from it.

02:16:31.285 --> 02:16:32.779
MATT: Hmm.

02:16:32.780 --> 02:16:34.054
SAM: It doesn't say how long.

02:16:34.055 --> 02:16:35.894
LIAM: Doesn't say anything about the--

02:16:35.895 --> 02:16:37.134
SAM: But it lasts.

02:16:37.135 --> 02:16:38.154
It could be indefinite.

02:16:38.155 --> 02:16:39.075
LAURA: Until it's triggered?

02:16:39.076 --> 02:16:40.524
MARISHA: Well, it's
proximity-based, right?

02:16:40.525 --> 02:16:41.525
Or until you trigger it?

02:16:41.526 --> 02:16:43.524
MATT: You can choose either to
have it remote detonation,

02:16:43.525 --> 02:16:45.314
in which case, it's within an hour.

02:16:45.315 --> 02:16:48.044
MARISHA: Okay.
MATT: Or proximity-based.

02:16:48.045 --> 02:16:50.114
LIAM: There's no, nothing's
mentioned on it.

02:16:50.115 --> 02:16:55.115
MATT: Proximity-based, it becomes
a marked mine until it's set off.

02:16:56.195 --> 02:16:58.425
SAM: That's pretty good.
ASHLEY: That is pretty good.

02:17:00.718 --> 02:17:03.196
MARISHA: What do we think?
Time's a-ticking.

02:17:03.197 --> 02:17:06.494
LAURA: If somebody gets within
60 feet of it, it sets it off,

02:17:06.495 --> 02:17:10.474
but the charge hits
everybody within 300 feet?

02:17:10.475 --> 02:17:12.124
TRAVIS: Yes.
LIAM: Yeah.

02:17:12.125 --> 02:17:13.144
LAURA: Cool.

02:17:13.145 --> 02:17:15.414
LIAM: But if we set them
at the bottom of the rope

02:17:15.415 --> 02:17:17.124
and they're falling,
they're going to get hit with it

02:17:17.125 --> 02:17:20.724
when they're up,
so it's not a straight line.

02:17:20.725 --> 02:17:22.594
Just factor that into your thinking.

02:17:22.595 --> 02:17:23.954
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

02:17:23.955 --> 02:17:25.464
LIAM: We should go
explore the rest of that,

02:17:25.465 --> 02:17:26.824
because we're putting all our eggs

02:17:26.825 --> 02:17:28.264
into this chamber basket, yeah?

02:17:28.265 --> 02:17:29.744
So we should know it fully.

02:17:29.745 --> 02:17:31.074
LAURA: Yeah, let's go back.

02:17:31.075 --> 02:17:32.934
MATT: All right. So you guys
are going to trek back

02:17:32.935 --> 02:17:34.964
and begin to plot out
what you wish to do.

02:17:34.965 --> 02:17:36.224
LIAM and MARISHA: Yeah.

02:17:36.225 --> 02:17:38.482
MATT: All right.
Well, I'll go ahead and

02:17:38.483 --> 02:17:40.403
bring the map out here
once we take a break.

02:17:40.404 --> 02:17:41.669
MARISHA: Yeah!

02:17:41.670 --> 02:17:42.862
Great time.
TALIESIN: Okay.

02:17:42.863 --> 02:17:44.184
It has been a while.
MATT: We've been going for

02:17:44.185 --> 02:17:46.084
a couple hours here.
LIAM: ♪ It's been a while! ♪

02:17:46.085 --> 02:17:47.474
MARISHA: Jeez louise.

02:17:47.475 --> 02:17:48.734
MATT: So we're going to
take a break here.

02:17:48.735 --> 02:17:49.568
We'll come back.

02:17:49.569 --> 02:17:52.044
We'll give you guys
some better examples

02:17:52.045 --> 02:17:54.634
of what you're working with, and then

02:17:54.635 --> 02:17:56.514
we'll see what you guys plan to do.

02:17:56.515 --> 02:17:58.465
So we'll see you here in a few minutes.

02:17:59.261 --> 02:18:04.261
(dramatic music)
(fire crackling)

02:18:04.928 --> 02:18:06.928
NARRATOR: Dwarvenite.

02:18:07.803 --> 02:18:11.636
The most precious substance among Dwarven smiths.

02:18:13.533 --> 02:18:17.250
Able to absorb the very spirit of the craftsman.

02:18:23.806 --> 02:18:27.723
Thus infused, it becomes nearly indestructible.

02:18:31.263 --> 02:18:34.726
Able to forge heirlooms that will last for generations.

02:18:37.004 --> 02:18:39.004
(yells)

02:18:45.468 --> 02:18:46.801
Pure Dwarvenite.

02:18:48.440 --> 02:18:53.282
Now you can get your hands on this legendary substance

02:18:53.283 --> 02:18:55.610
with the new Dungeon of Doom.

02:18:57.576 --> 02:19:00.326
Available now at dwarvenforge.com

02:19:07.455 --> 02:19:10.705
(light ethereal music)

02:19:39.145 --> 02:19:42.425
(whimsical adventure music)

02:19:42.426 --> 02:19:45.093
(keys clacking)

02:19:46.577 --> 02:19:50.244
(whimsical adventure music)

02:20:07.743 --> 02:20:09.872
LAURA: Hey, Critters, Laura Bailey here.

02:20:09.873 --> 02:20:12.246
Let's see what's up in the Critical Role shop.

02:20:14.153 --> 02:20:16.931
Oh my gosh, it's so amazing.

02:20:16.932 --> 02:20:19.515
(bright music)

02:20:20.653 --> 02:20:22.172
I mean, the Traveler always says,

02:20:22.173 --> 02:20:24.266
impulse purchases are a good decision.

02:20:27.133 --> 02:20:29.132
Can you put donuts in this?

02:20:29.133 --> 02:20:30.700
Only one way to find out.

02:20:32.713 --> 02:20:34.632
This is a lot of stuff, you guys.

02:20:34.633 --> 02:20:37.286
We have so many cool things right now.

02:20:39.293 --> 02:20:42.512
So click on over to the Critical Role shop. (laughs)

02:20:42.513 --> 02:20:44.341
Don't worry, there's a few more minutes in the break.

02:20:44.342 --> 02:20:45.925
You still got time.

02:20:48.213 --> 02:20:49.536
Subscribe.

02:20:51.013 --> 02:20:52.856
Or don't subscribe.

02:20:54.633 --> 02:20:56.836
Hmm, that's not a question.

02:20:59.133 --> 02:21:01.612
Whether it is nobler in the mind to ponder

02:21:01.613 --> 02:21:05.676
the pros and more pros of Twitch or Twitch Prime,

02:21:07.093 --> 02:21:10.242
or to take hands and gift new subs to Critters

02:21:10.243 --> 02:21:12.106
who find they can't afford them.

02:21:14.063 --> 02:21:15.026
To play.

02:21:17.943 --> 02:21:18.776
To sleep.

02:21:20.883 --> 02:21:21.716
No more.

02:21:23.213 --> 02:21:26.022
And by a sleep, to say, the cast and crew

02:21:26.023 --> 02:21:28.012
of Critical Role might find their naps

02:21:28.013 --> 02:21:31.322
around their hectic schedule of a live broadcast

02:21:31.323 --> 02:21:33.782
that we have brought for your consumption,

02:21:33.783 --> 02:21:36.446
both Critter and fan alike.

02:21:39.083 --> 02:21:42.196
To play, or sleep.

02:21:43.635 --> 02:21:45.522
(scoffs)

02:21:45.523 --> 02:21:49.396
No sleep, but just to stream.

02:21:51.103 --> 02:21:52.746
Aye, there's the rub.

02:21:53.883 --> 02:21:58.866
For with your subscription, what streams may come.

02:22:02.265 --> 02:22:05.282
Oh man, oh man, oh man, that is a fucking tagline.

02:22:05.283 --> 02:22:06.764
Do we got that?

02:22:06.765 --> 02:22:10.916
Ooh, that is Twitch poetry. (grunts)

02:22:12.113 --> 02:22:16.092
Oh, anyway, subscribe to Critical Role.

02:22:16.093 --> 02:22:18.212
Use Twitch Prime to subscribe.

02:22:18.213 --> 02:22:19.836
Gift some subscriptions.

02:22:20.773 --> 02:22:21.606
You got it.

02:22:24.243 --> 02:22:25.592
Hmm.

02:22:25.593 --> 02:22:29.426
Wrong soliloquy for the skull, but that's fucking good.

02:22:30.340 --> 02:22:33.840
(bright orchestral music)

02:34:26.388 --> 02:34:28.302
MATT: And welcome back.

02:34:28.303 --> 02:34:31.117
So last we left off,

02:34:31.118 --> 02:34:35.089
you were plotting and
planning what to do.

02:34:35.090 --> 02:34:36.272
You guys are going to head back

02:34:36.273 --> 02:34:38.354
and work out the space
from where you landed.

02:34:38.355 --> 02:34:39.188
LAURA: Yes.

02:34:39.189 --> 02:34:43.716
MATT: So you make your way
out of the city of Aeor,

02:34:43.717 --> 02:34:46.967
the Praesidis Ward,
back to the tunnel.

02:34:48.304 --> 02:34:49.578
LAURA: Oh yeah.
MATT: If you want to,

02:34:49.579 --> 02:34:51.088
like, there are bits of rubble

02:34:51.089 --> 02:34:52.388
and such you can take from the city

02:34:52.389 --> 02:34:55.410
and put across the gap--
SAM: Oh, to make it a bridge?

02:34:55.411 --> 02:34:57.562
MATT: -- and just make a bridge
to make it easier to get back.

02:34:57.563 --> 02:34:59.505
TALIESIN: Yeah, sure.
SAM: Sure.

02:34:59.506 --> 02:35:02.146
MATT: So you don't have to
do the rope thing every time.

02:35:02.147 --> 02:35:03.314
LAURA: Ooh, you know what would be good,

02:35:03.315 --> 02:35:05.306
if we do end up running away

02:35:05.307 --> 02:35:07.977
from whatever happens and
we have to hide in the city?

02:35:07.978 --> 02:35:10.768
When we run away, you should make, like,

02:35:10.769 --> 02:35:13.279
a thin ice bridge that looks like thick

02:35:13.280 --> 02:35:14.332
so that when they step on it,

02:35:14.333 --> 02:35:16.481
they fall down or something.

02:35:16.482 --> 02:35:19.643
Or I could do Stone Shape
really, really thin.

02:35:19.644 --> 02:35:21.357
Sexy, okay, let's keep going.

02:35:21.358 --> 02:35:22.191
(laughter)

02:35:22.192 --> 02:35:24.848
MATT: Okay, all right.

02:35:24.849 --> 02:35:28.672
There is the decline,
the icy decline down the hall.

02:35:28.673 --> 02:35:29.659
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

02:35:29.660 --> 02:35:32.054
MATT: How are you planning
to make your way down there?

02:35:32.055 --> 02:35:35.262
TRAVIS: On our butts, like
down a slippery driveway.

02:35:35.263 --> 02:35:36.570
LAURA: Like when you're on
the black diamond

02:35:36.571 --> 02:35:38.159
and you were scared.
TRAVIS: Oh, we do have a rope.

02:35:38.160 --> 02:35:40.608
LIAM: You rope it and you just--
MARISHA: Yeah, repel down?

02:35:40.609 --> 02:35:41.817
Yeah, so on the way back,

02:35:41.818 --> 02:35:44.664
I'll scoop up the rope, or I'll do--

02:35:44.665 --> 02:35:46.306
we'll do the other thing the other way,

02:35:46.307 --> 02:35:47.140
get everybody across--

02:35:47.141 --> 02:35:49.770
TRAVIS: We'll knot my 50 feet to it.

02:35:49.771 --> 02:35:51.703
MATT: Yeah, as long as you
have a three lengths of rope,

02:35:51.704 --> 02:35:52.955
I think you'll be able to do this.

02:35:52.956 --> 02:35:54.773
So you both have rope?
Somebody else have rope?

02:35:54.774 --> 02:35:56.339
LAURA: And Beau will
be the last one down,

02:35:56.340 --> 02:35:57.401
because you have Slow Fall

02:35:57.402 --> 02:35:59.116
so you can get down really easy, right?

02:35:59.117 --> 02:35:59.950
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:35:59.951 --> 02:36:01.883
MATT: Okay, so between the three of you,

02:36:01.884 --> 02:36:04.343
you manage to knot them together.
TALIESIN: Will make escaping easier, too.

02:36:04.344 --> 02:36:05.434
MARISHA: Uh-huh.
MATT: So with that,

02:36:05.435 --> 02:36:07.955
you won't be required to make
a check to descend down this.

02:36:07.956 --> 02:36:10.138
Slowly, you make your way to the base,

02:36:10.139 --> 02:36:14.696
back to the intersection where
the bodies of the salamanders

02:36:14.697 --> 02:36:16.737
in the fight earlier still remain

02:36:16.738 --> 02:36:17.738
covered in mold.
SAM: (sneezes)

02:36:17.739 --> 02:36:20.147
ALL: Bless you.

02:36:20.148 --> 02:36:22.925
MATT: Until eventually
you return to the chamber

02:36:22.926 --> 02:36:23.925
where you previously were,

02:36:23.926 --> 02:36:25.765
which I have set the map down here.

02:36:25.766 --> 02:36:28.456
You can see the entrance way that leads

02:36:28.457 --> 02:36:31.319
into the distant hallway
is on this far end.

02:36:31.320 --> 02:36:33.212
This is about where you land

02:36:33.213 --> 02:36:36.778
from the above open

02:36:36.779 --> 02:36:38.261
pit, if you will.

02:36:38.262 --> 02:36:39.756
This is the collapsed tower

02:36:39.757 --> 02:36:40.937
and some of the other rubble around.

02:36:40.938 --> 02:36:43.828
Anywhere where you've seen this
little bit of darker fuzz,

02:36:43.829 --> 02:36:45.924
is where the brown mold is.

02:36:45.925 --> 02:36:46.849
LAURA: Oh.

02:36:46.850 --> 02:36:49.285
MATT: This little 20-foot
space was carved out

02:36:49.286 --> 02:36:51.787
by Essek to help you guys get through.

02:36:51.788 --> 02:36:53.979
LAURA: Oh shit, okay, okay, okay.
SAM: Have we gotten a sense--

02:36:53.980 --> 02:36:57.123
for like, do we have to
touch it to get that effect?

02:36:57.124 --> 02:36:59.014
Be like within five feet of it?

02:36:59.015 --> 02:37:02.002
MATT: You get the sense
within the five or 10 feet,

02:37:02.003 --> 02:37:03.475
it seems to hurt you.
SAM: Okay.

02:37:03.476 --> 02:37:07.050
MATT: So as long as you stay
right in the middle of this room,

02:37:07.051 --> 02:37:07.948
you should be okay.

02:37:07.949 --> 02:37:09.214
SAM: Okay.

02:37:10.750 --> 02:37:13.042
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: So what's the plan?

02:37:14.318 --> 02:37:16.852
SAM: Well, let's set our charges and--

02:37:16.853 --> 02:37:18.816
LAURA: Yeah, somehow-- okay.

02:37:18.817 --> 02:37:21.966
I-- are we making the--
are we putting the glyph--

02:37:21.967 --> 02:37:23.269
LIAM: We have to put the glyph first.

02:37:23.270 --> 02:37:24.103
MARISHA: Yes.
LAURA: The symbol--

02:37:24.104 --> 02:37:26.356
Yeah, that has to be
up the tunnel right?

02:37:26.357 --> 02:37:27.977
LIAM: Because it's too
dangerous down here,

02:37:27.978 --> 02:37:29.540
we can't move around--
LAURA: So it has to be somewhere

02:37:29.541 --> 02:37:32.176
where they don't see it.

02:37:32.177 --> 02:37:34.634
Because Lucien will probably
be able to see anything

02:37:34.635 --> 02:37:35.950
if it's within eyesight.

02:37:35.951 --> 02:37:38.581
So I'm thinking I'll put it on
the underside of the doorway

02:37:38.582 --> 02:37:40.274
that door that was sticking out.

02:37:40.275 --> 02:37:41.108
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: That is

02:37:41.109 --> 02:37:42.823
higher than the mouth of the tunnel,

02:37:42.824 --> 02:37:45.449
so it can trigger a little sooner.

02:37:45.450 --> 02:37:47.816
Meaning less people
could be in the tunnel.

02:37:48.841 --> 02:37:51.668
LAURA: Oh right, oh well,
yeah, that's the other place

02:37:51.669 --> 02:37:54.341
I could put it is right
on the underside lip

02:37:54.342 --> 02:37:57.814
of the entrance into this cavern.

02:37:57.815 --> 02:38:00.069
So anybody that passes within like

02:38:00.070 --> 02:38:03.135
15 feet of it or
20 feet of it or whatever,

02:38:03.136 --> 02:38:06.731
will set it off and then
it'll have a 60-foot radius

02:38:06.732 --> 02:38:09.140
hopefully to cause them to fall.

02:38:09.141 --> 02:38:10.227
If they're--
MARISHA: But hopefully we want them

02:38:10.228 --> 02:38:12.475
to be climbing down,
because if they're still

02:38:12.476 --> 02:38:14.025
hanging out on that lip,
they won't fall,

02:38:14.026 --> 02:38:15.148
they'll be just be--
LAURA: Correct.

02:38:15.149 --> 02:38:15.982
MARISHA: -- incapacitated.

02:38:15.983 --> 02:38:18.787
LAURA: If they're
incapacitated on a rope,

02:38:18.788 --> 02:38:20.657
can they hang onto that rope?

02:38:22.074 --> 02:38:23.231
MATT: We'll find out.

02:38:23.232 --> 02:38:26.136
It would be hard,
but it's possible.

02:38:26.137 --> 02:38:27.519
LAURA: Okay.
TRAVIS: Some rolls?

02:38:27.520 --> 02:38:28.831
LIAM: So is it better than--
MATT: Yeah, there would be

02:38:28.832 --> 02:38:30.390
some rolls involved likely.

02:38:30.391 --> 02:38:32.073
LIAM: -- better than,
instead of the door then

02:38:32.074 --> 02:38:33.906
you're talking about
down here to the curve,

02:38:33.907 --> 02:38:34.974
underneath the cavern.

02:38:34.975 --> 02:38:35.808
LAURA: Yeah, so like--
LIAM: Yeah, because

02:38:35.809 --> 02:38:37.641
the more of them will have
a chance to come down.

02:38:37.642 --> 02:38:38.790
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: Yeah.

02:38:38.791 --> 02:38:39.624
TRAVIS: Load the chamber.

02:38:39.625 --> 02:38:43.659
ASHLEY: How tall is the
entrance to the ceiling?

02:38:43.660 --> 02:38:46.044
MATT: It's about 70 or so feet,
maybe a little higher than that.

02:38:46.045 --> 02:38:48.532
You couldn't quite see the bottom,

02:38:48.533 --> 02:38:50.479
when you were at the top
with 60 foot darkvision,

02:38:50.480 --> 02:38:52.186
you could see some of
the shapes of things

02:38:52.187 --> 02:38:53.020
that were poking up,

02:38:53.021 --> 02:38:54.358
but you could not
actually see the floor.

02:38:54.359 --> 02:38:55.657
So it's about 70,

02:38:55.658 --> 02:38:56.796
a little over 70 feet.
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:38:56.797 --> 02:38:57.630
LAURA: Okay.

02:38:57.631 --> 02:38:58.941
TRAVIS: Yeah, so if they're
climbing down the rope,

02:38:58.942 --> 02:39:01.298
they get 20 feet down. (snaps fingers)

02:39:01.299 --> 02:39:02.165
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

02:39:02.166 --> 02:39:03.262
LAURA: Okay.
TRAVIS: Ish.

02:39:03.263 --> 02:39:04.829
LIAM: Okay, now that's that,

02:39:04.830 --> 02:39:05.937
which we will do first.

02:39:05.938 --> 02:39:08.471
Down here, in this chamber,

02:39:09.852 --> 02:39:13.876
we need to have it so that
these charges need to be--

02:39:13.877 --> 02:39:17.685
well, we will put the
door to the mansion,

02:39:18.920 --> 02:39:20.847
which will be like our staging grounds,

02:39:20.848 --> 02:39:25.483
inside the hallway with
these dead lizards in them.

02:39:25.484 --> 02:39:27.389
SAM: And you will somehow
know that these--

02:39:27.390 --> 02:39:29.661
MATT: (knocks on table)
SAM: -- intuit charges have gone off.

02:39:29.662 --> 02:39:30.620
TRAVIS: There, right?

02:39:30.621 --> 02:39:32.434
MATT: That's the
entranceway, that's where

02:39:32.435 --> 02:39:34.695
the somewhat bent archway
that had the text across it.

02:39:34.696 --> 02:39:36.244
LAURA: You could put
the, you could put--

02:39:36.245 --> 02:39:38.394
so the wire.

02:39:38.395 --> 02:39:42.277
LIAM: Yeah, if we are able to rest here,

02:39:42.278 --> 02:39:44.921
in the morning, I can-- (groans)

02:39:44.922 --> 02:39:46.558
(sighs)

02:39:46.559 --> 02:39:48.267
LAURA: Oh right, because
that's not prepared today?

02:39:48.268 --> 02:39:52.078
LIAM: It's not-- I don't have that
and if we set the charges,

02:39:52.079 --> 02:39:53.137
MARISHA: You can't cross back.
LIAM: Then I can't go in there

02:39:53.138 --> 02:39:54.654
to do anything.
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:39:54.655 --> 02:39:57.489
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay,
if you set the charges--

02:39:57.490 --> 02:40:00.795
Okay, so if the mansion is
in the inside of the tunnel?

02:40:00.796 --> 02:40:01.741
LIAM: Yeah.
LAURA: Right?

02:40:01.742 --> 02:40:04.886
And the charges are set on the far side,

02:40:05.744 --> 02:40:08.767
like within 60 feet of
the center of the chamber

02:40:08.768 --> 02:40:10.085
where they drop, right?

02:40:10.086 --> 02:40:13.657
But it's not within
60 feet-- oh, it-- right?

02:40:13.658 --> 02:40:15.613
LIAM: The charges should be
on the edges of the chamber

02:40:15.614 --> 02:40:17.116
where there is cover for them

02:40:17.117 --> 02:40:19.521
so that they can't be seen
floating off of the ground.

02:40:19.522 --> 02:40:20.962
So the far end is not that good

02:40:20.963 --> 02:40:22.572
because that's wide open over there.

02:40:22.573 --> 02:40:23.512
TRAVIS: True.
LIAM: It would be spotted,

02:40:23.513 --> 02:40:27.128
the best is to put
one of these busy sides,

02:40:27.129 --> 02:40:28.906
and two on the other.

02:40:28.907 --> 02:40:30.437
They'll still, if--

02:40:30.438 --> 02:40:33.138
and the charges themselves
are hard to set, so.

02:40:34.787 --> 02:40:36.716
LAURA: We have to set them--
MARISHA: Okay.

02:40:36.717 --> 02:40:38.331
LAURA: Hopefully run away.

02:40:38.332 --> 02:40:39.536
LIAM: The moment we set the charges,

02:40:39.537 --> 02:40:41.425
we are done with this chamber until--

02:40:41.426 --> 02:40:43.436
TRAVIS: Correct.
LIAM: -- our friends set it off.

02:40:43.437 --> 02:40:45.225
LAURA: Okay, unless the charges are not

02:40:45.226 --> 02:40:46.704
within 60 feet of the tunnel door,

02:40:46.705 --> 02:40:49.878
then you could just step right
outside the tunnel door,

02:40:49.879 --> 02:40:54.091
spider climb your way up,
and put the line

02:40:54.092 --> 02:40:55.271
across the top of the chamber,

02:40:55.272 --> 02:40:58.587
because the top of the
chamber is like 70 feet up.

02:40:58.588 --> 02:41:00.003
TRAVIS: What?

02:41:00.004 --> 02:41:03.340
LIAM: She's saying that, if I can--

02:41:03.341 --> 02:41:06.199
SAM: That would be highly risky.
LIAM: Who has Spider Climb?

02:41:06.200 --> 02:41:07.515
TRAVIS: Don't look at me.
LIAM: You have spider climb?

02:41:07.516 --> 02:41:09.487
SAM: I do.
LIAM: You could cast it on me?

02:41:09.488 --> 02:41:10.321
SAM: No.

02:41:10.322 --> 02:41:12.085
I think I can only cast it on myself.

02:41:12.086 --> 02:41:13.878
LIAM: And that does not work because--

02:41:13.879 --> 02:41:15.799
ASHLEY: I could try to hold you.

02:41:15.800 --> 02:41:17.132
TRAVIS: For one minute.

02:41:17.133 --> 02:41:19.186
LAURA: I don't think,
or you could cast

02:41:19.187 --> 02:41:21.036
fly on yourself and fly up.

02:41:21.037 --> 02:41:22.720
SAM: Oh wait, no,
I can cast it on you.

02:41:22.721 --> 02:41:24.403
I could cast it on you.
LIAM: Okay.

02:41:24.404 --> 02:41:27.049
Which means that I could

02:41:27.050 --> 02:41:29.717
fiddle my way up and Alarm is--

02:41:30.591 --> 02:41:32.552
This is an if--
The alarm is a bonus

02:41:32.553 --> 02:41:33.855
that we don't know if
we're going to get,

02:41:33.856 --> 02:41:36.627
because it depends on if
we can rest for the night.

02:41:37.844 --> 02:41:39.042
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.
LIAM: One second.

02:41:39.043 --> 02:41:41.959
Alarm-- I don't even need
a spell slot, it's low level.

02:41:41.960 --> 02:41:45.675
But if I can climb up the
far end of the chamber

02:41:45.676 --> 02:41:48.062
like you're talking about,
and you can make it

02:41:48.063 --> 02:41:51.022
so that the sigil is
not going to hurt me?

02:41:53.538 --> 02:41:54.587
TRAVIS: No.
LAURA: I don't know

02:41:54.588 --> 02:41:56.870
how fancy of a trigger I can put on this thing.
MATT: No, the--

02:41:56.871 --> 02:41:58.320
SAM: Wait--
MATT: -- the sigil? Hmm.

02:41:58.321 --> 02:42:01.823
LAURA: I think I can
make it a trigger for--

02:42:01.824 --> 02:42:05.510
SAM: Regardless of
whether this Alarm spell--

02:42:05.511 --> 02:42:07.998
MATT: "Or according to a
creature's physical characteristics,

02:42:07.999 --> 02:42:10.696
"like weight or height
or physical kind."

02:42:10.697 --> 02:42:11.650
LAURA: Right, but I can't--

02:42:11.651 --> 02:42:14.195
TALIESIN: I'm losing joy for the alarm.

02:42:14.196 --> 02:42:15.291
MATT: "You can also specify creatures

02:42:15.292 --> 02:42:16.615
"that don't trigger the glyph."

02:42:16.616 --> 02:42:19.286
LAURA: Oh! Specifically that doesn't--
MATT: Such as those that--

02:42:19.287 --> 02:42:20.667
MATT: Yeah, or have a certain password

02:42:20.668 --> 02:42:21.758
that he could say as he passes it.

02:42:21.759 --> 02:42:23.486
LAURA: Okay, great. Oh, I love it!

02:42:23.487 --> 02:42:26.138
LIAM: So I could, if
all goes well in there

02:42:26.139 --> 02:42:29.301
a ways out I could
(footsteps) up the side--

02:42:30.851 --> 02:42:32.682
we have to really look at the math

02:42:32.683 --> 02:42:36.781
of if that far wall is away
from hiding spots with charges,

02:42:36.782 --> 02:42:39.497
go up, set the alarm,

02:42:39.498 --> 02:42:42.094
deedle-leedle-lee-lee come back down,

02:42:42.095 --> 02:42:47.095
then I would have to hang out
outside the door to our tower.

02:42:47.374 --> 02:42:49.344
And if they trigger the alarm,

02:42:49.345 --> 02:42:51.945
it will go ding in my head as it does.

02:42:54.926 --> 02:42:58.561
But that means like,
no one can really go to--

02:42:58.562 --> 02:42:59.575
how do we go to sleep?

02:42:59.576 --> 02:43:00.891
TRAVIS: I only need a short rest.

02:43:00.892 --> 02:43:02.056
LAURA: I need to sleep.

02:43:02.057 --> 02:43:03.853
TRAVIS: And I don't really
even need a short rest.

02:43:03.854 --> 02:43:06.396
MARISHA: I am one with Fjord;
I don't necessarily need--

02:43:06.397 --> 02:43:08.517
LAURA: We all sleep right
inside the door to the tower.

02:43:08.518 --> 02:43:10.769
SAM: If the alarm doesn't
work or whatever,

02:43:10.770 --> 02:43:13.923
how do we know that the
intuit charges have gone off?

02:43:13.924 --> 02:43:15.936
LAURA: That's the thing.

02:43:15.937 --> 02:43:18.863
TRAVIS: They play Yankee Doodle Dandy
when they go off.

02:43:18.864 --> 02:43:20.217
(laughter)
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:43:20.218 --> 02:43:22.033
TRAVIS: ♪ I'm a Yankee Doodle Da-- ♪

02:43:22.034 --> 02:43:24.705
MATT: Like those cake candles
start singing as they burn?

02:43:24.706 --> 02:43:26.678
LIAM: There is a-- there is
another kind of alarm.

02:43:26.679 --> 02:43:28.951
TALIESIN: I'm also going to
say there will be screaming.

02:43:28.952 --> 02:43:30.924
LIAM: Yeah, that's the other kind of alarm.
TALIESIN: There will be--

02:43:30.925 --> 02:43:32.690
LAURA: You can't hear
through the doorway.

02:43:32.691 --> 02:43:33.782
SAM: We're going to be
in another dimension.

02:43:33.783 --> 02:43:35.354
LIAM: No, but the door can be open

02:43:35.355 --> 02:43:37.160
and we can hang out outside the door.

02:43:37.161 --> 02:43:39.602
SAM: But then we'll be in the
path of the intuit charge.

02:43:39.603 --> 02:43:41.127
LAURA: Or we can leave the door open

02:43:41.128 --> 02:43:45.440
and like, say, the minute we
hear a noise, we shut the door.

02:43:45.441 --> 02:43:47.599
So we know if that glyph goes off,

02:43:47.600 --> 02:43:50.183
somebody makes a noise, and then

02:43:50.184 --> 02:43:51.596
we shut the door because it'll set--

02:43:51.597 --> 02:43:52.620
MATT: If you're readying the door

02:43:52.621 --> 02:43:55.128
as a readied action to slam it shut,

02:43:55.129 --> 02:43:57.470
for when you hear or
see a certain thing,

02:43:57.471 --> 02:43:58.381
there's a pretty good chance

02:43:58.382 --> 02:44:01.048
you can close it before
anything gets through.

02:44:01.049 --> 02:44:02.423
LIAM: It just means that--

02:44:02.424 --> 02:44:04.756
SAM: Yeah, we'll hear the glyph go off,

02:44:04.757 --> 02:44:08.002
but we won't know if the
intuit charges have gone off.

02:44:09.035 --> 02:44:10.651
LAURA: No.
MATT: Correct.

02:44:12.564 --> 02:44:16.370
LAURA: We'd have to wait
basically 10 seconds

02:44:16.371 --> 02:44:17.691
and then open the door.

02:44:17.692 --> 02:44:18.949
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:44:18.950 --> 02:44:21.406
LIAM: Well, that's not even a guarantee.

02:44:21.407 --> 02:44:23.661
TRAVIS: Or put them at
the same distance--

02:44:23.662 --> 02:44:25.920
SAM: Here's just a thing,
here's a thing.

02:44:25.921 --> 02:44:28.383
LIAM: Yeah, yeah.
SAM: What if we leave Frumpkin out?

02:44:28.384 --> 02:44:30.069
LIAM: Mm-hmm.
MARISHA: Oh, yeah.

02:44:30.070 --> 02:44:32.927
SAM: And we'll-- out of the mansion.

02:44:32.928 --> 02:44:35.462
When the intuit charges go off--
LIAM: He's gone.

02:44:35.463 --> 02:44:37.272
SAM: And you would feel that?

02:44:38.751 --> 02:44:39.777
You would know that?

02:44:39.778 --> 02:44:42.350
LIAM: I don't think I've ever felt that.

02:44:42.351 --> 02:44:43.751
TRAVIS: Could you see
through from Frumpkin's eyes

02:44:43.752 --> 02:44:44.585
if you're in the mansion

02:44:44.586 --> 02:44:46.310
and he's outside and the door's closed.
LIAM: Yes.

02:44:46.311 --> 02:44:47.960
MARISHA: Could he be a bat?
SAM: Oh, then you can do that.

02:44:47.961 --> 02:44:48.794
LIAM: Oh, I don't know,

02:44:48.795 --> 02:44:50.629
but not probably not to another plane.

02:44:50.630 --> 02:44:52.163
MATT: Probably not to
another plane, unfortunately.

02:44:52.164 --> 02:44:55.580
LAURA: Okay, okay, what if we find--

02:44:55.581 --> 02:44:57.785
Fuck me running.

02:44:57.786 --> 02:44:58.860
TRAVIS: What's up?

02:44:58.861 --> 02:45:00.215
LIAM: And I would say--
LAURA: Nothing.

02:45:00.216 --> 02:45:02.710
LIAM: I could just go into a trance

02:45:02.711 --> 02:45:04.702
and just be looking
through Frumpkin's eyes,

02:45:04.703 --> 02:45:06.340
but we all know that we have--

02:45:06.341 --> 02:45:08.419
Our skills have outgrown Frumpkin,

02:45:08.420 --> 02:45:10.177
and Lucien will see Frumpkin

02:45:10.178 --> 02:45:12.037
if he is there.
SAM: I think I've got it.

02:45:13.381 --> 02:45:18.048
You don't have to be in
the mansion, or sorry, tower,

02:45:18.049 --> 02:45:19.309
when we are. Do you have to be

02:45:19.310 --> 02:45:20.694
in there with us?
LIAM: No, that's the dome

02:45:20.695 --> 02:45:22.235
is like that.
SAM: You make the tower.

02:45:22.236 --> 02:45:23.819
LIAM: Yeah.
SAM: Right?

02:45:23.820 --> 02:45:26.370
We all go in the tower,
we go to sleep,

02:45:26.371 --> 02:45:28.000
We have a grand old time.

02:45:28.001 --> 02:45:31.383
You stay out of the tower,

02:45:31.384 --> 02:45:33.582
farther away, 300 feet away,

02:45:33.583 --> 02:45:36.557
when you hear/see those
into intuit charges go

02:45:36.558 --> 02:45:38.023
ba-boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,

02:45:38.024 --> 02:45:41.277
you drop the tower,
we're all out, boom, it's on.

02:45:41.278 --> 02:45:43.071
LIAM: How will I see that happen?

02:45:43.072 --> 02:45:45.800
SAM: You'll have to keep your keen ear.

02:45:45.801 --> 02:45:48.066
Or you can have Frumpkin!
You could have Frumpkin!

02:45:48.067 --> 02:45:50.459
Because you'll be on the
same plane as he is.

02:45:50.460 --> 02:45:53.135
You'll be 300 feet away,
Frumpkin will be in the room.

02:45:53.136 --> 02:45:55.110
LAURA: What if another
salamander creature comes out

02:45:55.111 --> 02:45:55.977
and attacks Caleb

02:45:55.977 --> 02:45:56.866
and kills him?!
SAM: Caleb will be fine!

02:45:56.867 --> 02:45:58.172
He's the strongest among us.

02:45:58.173 --> 02:46:00.506
LIAM: Well, I could do the-- hmm.

02:46:00.507 --> 02:46:03.942
I could do the dome where I am sitting.

02:46:03.943 --> 02:46:05.525
LAURA: (gasps)
LIAM: And

02:46:05.526 --> 02:46:09.017
Frumpkin sits at the entrance here.

02:46:09.018 --> 02:46:09.926
LAURA: Yeah!
LIAM: But he's not

02:46:09.927 --> 02:46:12.233
Sherlock Holmes, but he would
be able to see people falling

02:46:12.234 --> 02:46:13.286
in the middle of the cavern.
SAM: Sure!

02:46:13.287 --> 02:46:17.281
And then you just instantly
dispel the mansion-- the tower.

02:46:17.282 --> 02:46:19.481
LIAM: It's true.
SAM: We're out, we're on attack.

02:46:19.482 --> 02:46:22.202
MARISHA: But you need a full
night's rest, right? For sure.

02:46:22.203 --> 02:46:23.660
LIAM: Uh.
LAURA: Not as much--

02:46:23.661 --> 02:46:26.493
LIAM: Unless someone wants
to heal me up before bed,

02:46:26.494 --> 02:46:29.361
before you go to bed because
I'm not at full right now.

02:46:30.398 --> 02:46:32.299
LAURA: But do you have
a lot of spells left?

02:46:32.300 --> 02:46:34.082
LIAM: Well, I used arcane recovery

02:46:34.083 --> 02:46:35.423
when we took the short rest--

02:46:35.424 --> 02:46:37.161
LAURA: Okay, that's good.
LIAM: -- so I got some back.

02:46:37.162 --> 02:46:39.440
I have used one third and
one fourth, currently.

02:46:39.441 --> 02:46:40.855
Which is not bad.
LAURA: Not bad.

02:46:40.856 --> 02:46:43.142
SAM: Also, I could stay
out with you also.

02:46:43.143 --> 02:46:47.079
I don't need to be in the tower.

02:46:47.080 --> 02:46:48.707
MARISHA: Is there any reason then why

02:46:48.708 --> 02:46:50.786
any of us need to be in
the tower at that point?

02:46:50.787 --> 02:46:52.612
SAM: Because it's closer.

02:46:52.613 --> 02:46:53.513
MARISHA: Oh, because it's closer.

02:46:53.514 --> 02:46:55.661
Oh, and then we're like,
"Gah, SEAL team, go!"

02:46:55.662 --> 02:46:57.110
SAM: The attack's on!
MARISHA: All right.

02:46:57.111 --> 02:46:59.821
SAM: But I can be far away
because I can just run real fast.

02:46:59.822 --> 02:47:00.987
MARISHA: Okay.
TRAVIS: It'll take us about

02:47:00.988 --> 02:47:04.266
15 seconds to close the distance
if we're 300 feet away.

02:47:05.215 --> 02:47:07.014
MARISHA: Okay.
TRAVIS: We really don't--

02:47:07.015 --> 02:47:08.969
I mean, it's whatever.

02:47:08.970 --> 02:47:12.324
TALIESIN: You're a lot of damage,
but yeah, that's--

02:47:12.325 --> 02:47:15.412
TRAVIS: If they are stunned
or whatever, that's 10 rounds.

02:47:15.413 --> 02:47:16.246
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:47:17.306 --> 02:47:18.812
MARISHA: Right.

02:47:18.813 --> 02:47:20.384
LAURA: While we're all
talking about this, Caleb,

02:47:20.385 --> 02:47:22.718
will you turn some of
these diamonds into dust?

02:47:22.719 --> 02:47:24.378
LIAM: That will take me
a little bit of time,

02:47:24.379 --> 02:47:25.765
but yeah, I can do that.
LAURA: Okay.

02:47:25.766 --> 02:47:27.031
TALIESIN: Well, let's--

02:47:27.032 --> 02:47:29.410
LIAM: Oh, but that's more
slots that we'll burn.

02:47:29.411 --> 02:47:31.035
MARISHA: Huh?

02:47:31.036 --> 02:47:33.768
LAURA: We need it. What do we do?

02:47:33.769 --> 02:47:36.117
SAM: What do you need?
You need dusty diamonds?

02:47:36.118 --> 02:47:37.350
LIAM: I could definitely do it.

02:47:37.351 --> 02:47:38.454
SAM: For what?

02:47:38.455 --> 02:47:41.591
LAURA: Okay, how much
diamond dust do I have?

02:47:41.592 --> 02:47:45.312
I have 200 Gs worth of
opals, we need to--

02:47:45.313 --> 02:47:47.121
MARISHA: I know.
MATT: I'm getting butterflies y'all.

02:47:47.122 --> 02:47:48.097
LIAM: Yeah.

02:47:48.097 --> 02:47:49.055
SAM: One more crazy idea,

02:47:49.056 --> 02:47:51.653
I'm just going to throw it out there
because why not?

02:47:51.654 --> 02:47:54.758
You know the tunnel that we
crawled through before the rope?

02:47:54.759 --> 02:47:56.883
You know the tunnel that we
crawled through before the rope?

02:47:56.884 --> 02:47:57.859
LIAM: Mm-hmm.
TRAVIS: At the top?

02:47:57.860 --> 02:47:59.657
SAM: Yeah, like right at the lip there.

02:47:59.658 --> 02:48:00.519
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:48:00.520 --> 02:48:03.303
SAM: What if I just smeared a
bunch of my sovereign glue on it,

02:48:03.304 --> 02:48:05.929
so while they're waiting for
the next person to go down,

02:48:05.930 --> 02:48:07.951
they're like, "Oh fuck,
I'm stuck here forever!"

02:48:07.952 --> 02:48:09.959
I don't know.
TRAVIS: Put sovereign glue on the rope.

02:48:09.960 --> 02:48:13.370
SAM: Yeah. Well, they have
to touch it for a minute.

02:48:13.371 --> 02:48:14.852
TRAVIS: Oh, I got you.
SAM: So it would have to be

02:48:14.853 --> 02:48:16.950
while they're waiting for
their friend to go down.

02:48:16.951 --> 02:48:18.643
LAURA: And then they'd have
to chop their own hand off

02:48:18.644 --> 02:48:20.769
in order to get down.

02:48:20.770 --> 02:48:21.603
You could put it, like,

02:48:21.604 --> 02:48:23.260
smear it to where their
whole belly get stuck.

02:48:23.261 --> 02:48:24.415
SAM: Oh yeah!

02:48:24.416 --> 02:48:26.203
TALIESIN: Wouldn't they know?

02:48:26.204 --> 02:48:27.357
SAM: It would have to be a hand, though,

02:48:27.358 --> 02:48:28.652
because if it's their clothes,

02:48:28.653 --> 02:48:30.102
they could just take off their clothes.

02:48:30.103 --> 02:48:33.568
TALIESIN: So weird question is:

02:48:33.569 --> 02:48:36.244
Is there a way to put some oil
down where they would drop, too,

02:48:36.245 --> 02:48:38.447
so that we could light that
up when they hit the ground?

02:48:38.448 --> 02:48:41.177
MARISHA: Or put the sovereign glue
where they might fall.

02:48:41.178 --> 02:48:43.539
LAURA: And then light it up,
they're stuck there,

02:48:43.540 --> 02:48:45.355
also the stuff comes and get them.

02:48:45.356 --> 02:48:46.856
MARISHA: Yeah!
TALIESIN: It takes a minute.

02:48:46.857 --> 02:48:49.871
SAM: Oh, and we have
wolverines and we let those go

02:48:49.872 --> 02:48:51.499
and they attack, because we--

02:48:51.500 --> 02:48:53.866
MATT: This the most
Divinity: Original Sin 2

02:48:53.867 --> 02:48:56.785
setup for an encounter and I love it.

02:48:56.786 --> 02:48:57.619
I love it.

02:48:57.620 --> 02:49:00.859
TALIESIN: The fire would've cracked
the bowl, was all I was thinking.

02:49:00.860 --> 02:49:03.093
MARISHA: How much glue do you have?

02:49:03.094 --> 02:49:04.723
SAM: Not a lot.
MARISHA: Nah.

02:49:04.724 --> 02:49:06.381
LAURA: But a little glue--
MARISHA: If it was a lot.

02:49:06.382 --> 02:49:07.215
LAURA: -- and some oil,

02:49:07.216 --> 02:49:08.938
but oil at the bottom is really smart.

02:49:08.939 --> 02:49:10.676
That would catch and we
can set them on fire.

02:49:10.677 --> 02:49:12.216
SAM: I could also just
put a fluffernutter down there.

02:49:12.217 --> 02:49:14.219
LIAM: I just had the most
frustrating thought.

02:49:14.220 --> 02:49:16.183
We're going to spend
the next hour throwing

02:49:16.184 --> 02:49:19.139
around cockamamie bullshit
ideas, set it in place,

02:49:19.140 --> 02:49:21.276
they're going to crawl out,
and Matt's going to go,

02:49:21.277 --> 02:49:22.267
"And that's where we'll end things."

02:49:22.267 --> 02:49:23.100
MARISHA: Yeah!

02:49:23.101 --> 02:49:24.574
SAM: That's why we got to
get this going.

02:49:24.575 --> 02:49:26.532
All right, let's launch
the plan, let's go.

02:49:26.533 --> 02:49:27.565
This is it.
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay.

02:49:27.566 --> 02:49:28.588
Grind some diamonds.

02:49:28.589 --> 02:49:32.961
LAURA: I'm just going to use
the residuum dust, too, yeah,

02:49:32.962 --> 02:49:33.795
because, I mean, what else?

02:49:33.796 --> 02:49:35.398
TALIESIN: I've got some diamonds
if you need some diamonds.

02:49:35.399 --> 02:49:38.211
LAURA: Okay, 200 Gs of residuum dust,

02:49:38.212 --> 02:49:40.161
so I need

02:49:40.162 --> 02:49:43.752
600 diamonds--

02:49:43.753 --> 02:49:44.835
600 gold worth of--

02:49:44.836 --> 02:49:47.782
Oh, I already have 400 gold
worth of diamond dust!

02:49:47.783 --> 02:49:51.173
400 diamond dust,
so I need-- That's 400--

02:49:51.174 --> 02:49:52.707
200--
LIAM: Oh boy.

02:49:53.707 --> 02:49:56.409
SAM: We have residuum, too.

02:49:56.410 --> 02:49:58.192
LAURA: Do you have a hundred diamonds--

02:49:58.193 --> 02:49:59.892
a hundred gold diamond?

02:49:59.893 --> 02:50:02.145
SAM: What? (laughs)

02:50:02.146 --> 02:50:03.470
LAURA: I have a 300 gold diamond.

02:50:03.471 --> 02:50:04.836
Okay, I'll take that.
MARISHA: 100 gold diamonds.

02:50:04.837 --> 02:50:07.073
TALIESIN: I have 150 gold
diamond, if you want.

02:50:08.273 --> 02:50:09.504
LAURA: No.
TALIESIN: Aight.

02:50:09.505 --> 02:50:10.868
SAM: We have residuum.

02:50:10.869 --> 02:50:12.189
LAURA: We have residuum,
but we only have

02:50:12.190 --> 02:50:14.119
200 gold worth of residuum.

02:50:14.120 --> 02:50:15.312
TALIESIN: It's better to use diamonds.

02:50:15.313 --> 02:50:17.896
LAURA: 400 gold worth of diamond dust,

02:50:17.897 --> 02:50:19.538
and then I still need another diamond.

02:50:19.539 --> 02:50:22.521
So I need to you to turn
one diamond, this diamond,

02:50:22.522 --> 02:50:24.535
Caleb, into dust.

02:50:24.536 --> 02:50:26.041
LIAM: We don't have any other dust

02:50:26.042 --> 02:50:28.142
or residuum or anything like that.

02:50:28.143 --> 02:50:30.275
LAURA: This is everything in my--

02:50:30.276 --> 02:50:31.683
TALIESIN: How much residuum would--

02:50:31.684 --> 02:50:33.597
LAURA: 200 gold worth of residuum.

02:50:33.598 --> 02:50:35.115
TALIESIN: I have 200 gold
worth of residuum--

02:50:35.116 --> 02:50:37.076
SAM: There, we don't
need any diamond dust.

02:50:37.077 --> 02:50:38.434
LAURA: Great, but we do need to turn

02:50:38.435 --> 02:50:40.584
these 200 gold worth of opals into dust.

02:50:40.585 --> 02:50:41.880
SAM: That fucking--

02:50:41.881 --> 02:50:43.887
(laughter)

02:50:43.888 --> 02:50:46.377
LAURA: I could just crush them with my--

02:50:46.378 --> 02:50:47.680
Like, I could try to crush them,

02:50:47.681 --> 02:50:50.346
opal's way softer than diamonds.

02:50:50.347 --> 02:50:51.606
MATT: They are, do you want to try it?

02:50:51.607 --> 02:50:53.226
SAM: What about Yasha?
Yasha could do it.

02:50:53.227 --> 02:50:54.417
LAURA: But I don't want
to do it, like, fast,

02:50:54.418 --> 02:50:55.635
because I don't want it to spread apart.

02:50:55.636 --> 02:50:57.180
So I'm going to put it
down on a little thing

02:50:57.181 --> 02:50:59.502
and I'm going to sit
and just like (grunting)

02:50:59.503 --> 02:51:02.802
and have Yasha maybe
hammer down onto my axe

02:51:02.803 --> 02:51:04.290
which is sitting on top of the opals.

02:51:04.291 --> 02:51:05.781
ASHLEY: Okay.
SAM: Oh, like a garlic?

02:51:05.782 --> 02:51:06.615
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah!

02:51:06.616 --> 02:51:07.955
ASHLEY: Like the flat of the--

02:51:07.956 --> 02:51:09.143
LAURA: Like you do garlic.

02:51:09.144 --> 02:51:11.556
Okay, I'm taking all of this
stuff out of my inventory.

02:51:11.557 --> 02:51:14.604
LIAM: If it totally goes wrong
and fucked, I can fix it,

02:51:14.605 --> 02:51:17.518
but let's see if we
can save my reserves.

02:51:17.519 --> 02:51:18.856
ASHLEY: Let's see if we can save it.

02:51:18.857 --> 02:51:19.690
LAURA: Okay.
ASHLEY: Yep.

02:51:19.691 --> 02:51:21.147
MATT: Okay.

02:51:21.148 --> 02:51:25.656
Placing it beneath Jester's axe,
using what to crush it?

02:51:27.219 --> 02:51:28.052
LAURA: Oh.

02:51:28.994 --> 02:51:31.312
You choose what you want to
hammer on top of the axe.

02:51:31.313 --> 02:51:32.146
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:51:33.130 --> 02:51:34.720
MATT: Does anybody have a hammer?

02:51:34.721 --> 02:51:37.186
ASHLEY: I am going to take--
TRAVIS: I do.

02:51:37.187 --> 02:51:38.214
LAURA: You do?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:51:38.215 --> 02:51:39.384
LAURA: Okay, yeah.
TALIESIN: Oh, we got a hammer.

02:51:39.385 --> 02:51:40.483
MATT: What kind of hammer?
ASHLEY: We have a hammer?

02:51:40.484 --> 02:51:42.146
TRAVIS: I have a climbing hammer.

02:51:42.147 --> 02:51:43.420
ASHLEY: There you go.
TRAVIS: Hammer and my

02:51:43.421 --> 02:51:44.254
pitons.
LAURA: That seems like

02:51:44.254 --> 02:51:45.087
a little teeny hammer.

02:51:45.088 --> 02:51:46.757
MATT: That's a tiny hammer.
I don't know if that's really--

02:51:46.758 --> 02:51:47.607
TRAVIS: It's a hammer.

02:51:47.607 --> 02:51:48.584
LIAM: Are you saying you can't

02:51:48.585 --> 02:51:50.190
put that gem right here and just flex?

02:51:50.191 --> 02:51:52.513
MARISHA: Aw, you beat-- yeah.
ASHLEY: I could try.

02:51:52.514 --> 02:51:53.347
Let me try it.

02:51:53.348 --> 02:51:55.045
LAURA: I don't want to
lose the dust, Yasha.

02:51:55.046 --> 02:51:56.748
ASHLEY: Okay, I won't, I promise.

02:51:56.749 --> 02:51:57.709
I'm going to try.
MARISHA: Do it.

02:51:57.710 --> 02:51:59.054
MATT: Roll a strength check.

02:51:59.055 --> 02:51:59.888
ASHLEY: This is so stupid.

02:51:59.888 --> 02:52:00.821
TALIESIN: I'm not guiding that.
MARISHA: Come on, babe,

02:52:00.822 --> 02:52:02.303
this is the hottest you've ever been.

02:52:02.304 --> 02:52:04.943
LIAM: Maybe thighs is the way to go.

02:52:06.819 --> 02:52:09.290
MARISHA: She's got really strong thighs.

02:52:09.291 --> 02:52:11.863
LAURA: (cackles)
ASHLEY: Okay, this is

02:52:13.888 --> 02:52:15.071
26.

02:52:16.444 --> 02:52:17.876
MATT: Strength check?
ASHLEY: Wait, that doesn't make any sense,

02:52:17.877 --> 02:52:19.402
I'm really sorry.
MATT: It's okay.

02:52:19.403 --> 02:52:21.435
ASHLEY: Math. 24.

02:52:21.436 --> 02:52:23.107
Nope, still wrong.

02:52:23.108 --> 02:52:25.719
23. Jeez louise.

02:52:25.720 --> 02:52:27.162
Sorry, I'm so tired.

02:52:27.163 --> 02:52:28.163
TALIESIN: We're all--

02:52:28.164 --> 02:52:29.247
ASHLEY: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Today.

02:52:30.903 --> 02:52:32.486
MATT: That's fantastic.

02:52:33.554 --> 02:52:34.644
LAURA: It doesn't work.

02:52:34.645 --> 02:52:37.228
(laughter)

02:52:38.147 --> 02:52:42.275
MATT: As you squeeze, you do
manage to crack the opal,

02:52:42.276 --> 02:52:43.943
which is impressive.

02:52:45.040 --> 02:52:46.973
You don't quite turn it to dust.

02:52:46.974 --> 02:52:48.484
ASHLEY: Well, you know, we got started.

02:52:48.485 --> 02:52:49.318
LAURA: Yeah, that's great.

02:52:49.319 --> 02:52:50.825
ASHLEY: Got it started, babe.
MATT: That is impressive.

02:52:50.826 --> 02:52:53.978
ASHLEY: I cracked it
between my-- this part.

02:52:53.979 --> 02:52:55.011
MARISHA: You need to stop,

02:52:55.012 --> 02:52:57.830
we're not a good place.
TALIESIN: You get to say it: It's looking pretty rough.

02:52:57.831 --> 02:52:59.435
LAURA: It is looking really rough.

02:52:59.436 --> 02:53:00.484
ASHLEY: We'll put it under your-- Yeah.

02:53:00.485 --> 02:53:02.503
LAURA: Now I'm going to
try the garlic paste.

02:53:02.504 --> 02:53:03.576
What?

02:53:03.577 --> 02:53:06.110
TALIESIN: All right. d4.

02:53:06.111 --> 02:53:09.435
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to--

02:53:09.436 --> 02:53:10.294
ASHLEY: You're strong.

02:53:10.295 --> 02:53:11.987
LAURA: Put-- Oh!

02:53:11.988 --> 02:53:13.025
Here's what I'm going to do.

02:53:13.026 --> 02:53:14.287
MATT: Mm-hmm.

02:53:14.288 --> 02:53:15.784
LAURA: I'm going to
put it on the ground.

02:53:15.785 --> 02:53:16.618
MATT: Mm-hmm.
LAURA: I'm going to take my

02:53:16.619 --> 02:53:18.565
round shield on top of it,

02:53:18.566 --> 02:53:21.995
and I'm going to put all my
weight and be like (grunting).

02:53:21.996 --> 02:53:23.100
MATT: Okay.

02:53:23.101 --> 02:53:26.144
LAURA: Also, I'm going to
hammer it first with my axe,

02:53:26.145 --> 02:53:27.752
the blunt end of my axe.

02:53:27.753 --> 02:53:29.286
MATT: Okay, make a strength check.
LAURA: I'm going to do all of the things.

02:53:29.287 --> 02:53:30.536
MATT: All right, make a strength check.

02:53:30.537 --> 02:53:32.076
(laughter)

02:53:32.077 --> 02:53:34.581
LAURA: With a d4.
TALIESIN: With a d4.

02:53:34.582 --> 02:53:37.289
MATT: You are in this middle
of the metallic hallway or--

02:53:37.290 --> 02:53:40.358
LAURA: No! No, of course not, Matthew!

02:53:40.359 --> 02:53:42.218
MATT: No, I'm asking:
Where are you doing it?

02:53:42.219 --> 02:53:44.785
LAURA: I'm going to do this--

02:53:45.635 --> 02:53:47.351
I don't want it to be loud.

02:53:48.385 --> 02:53:50.852
I'm going to try to do it with just my--

02:53:50.853 --> 02:53:52.110
Fuck me running.

02:53:52.111 --> 02:53:54.440
I'm not going to use my shield--
I'm not going to hammer.

02:53:54.441 --> 02:53:56.794
I'm going to try do with
just my shield first,

02:53:56.795 --> 02:53:58.377
so it doesn't make noise.

02:53:58.378 --> 02:54:00.503
MATT: Okay. Make a strength check.

02:54:01.386 --> 02:54:02.368
MARISHA: If we're going to summon it--

02:54:02.369 --> 02:54:04.334
LIAM: Come on muscles, get it.

02:54:04.335 --> 02:54:05.168
TALIESIN: I don't know.

02:54:05.169 --> 02:54:06.668
LAURA: Motherfuck.

02:54:07.582 --> 02:54:08.710
TALIESIN: With the d4?

02:54:08.711 --> 02:54:10.218
LIAM: Is that the good kind of "motherfuck"?
LAURA: That was with the d4?

02:54:10.219 --> 02:54:11.160
I got 11.

02:54:11.161 --> 02:54:14.725
MATT: 11, so you put the
shield down and you sit on it,

02:54:15.673 --> 02:54:16.854
it gives way.

02:54:16.855 --> 02:54:18.558
LAURA: Oh.
MATT: The rest of you watch it go--

02:54:18.559 --> 02:54:19.392
(high-pitched firing off)

02:54:19.393 --> 02:54:20.876
(laughter)

02:54:20.877 --> 02:54:22.463
Just fire off.

02:54:22.464 --> 02:54:24.808
TRAVIS: I got it, I got it, I got it!

02:54:24.809 --> 02:54:26.191
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:54:26.192 --> 02:54:29.637
LIAM: See, aren't you glad
we didn't set the intuit charges?

02:54:29.638 --> 02:54:31.371
TRAVIS: 20, 17 plus three.

02:54:31.372 --> 02:54:33.179
MATT: You do. You eye it as it fires off

02:54:33.180 --> 02:54:34.563
and you manage to find out

02:54:34.564 --> 02:54:37.380
exactly where it'd come
to rest. It is not lost.

02:54:37.381 --> 02:54:38.713
LAURA: Thank god.

02:54:38.714 --> 02:54:39.916
MARISHA: Do you have an alchemy kit?

02:54:39.917 --> 02:54:42.170
LAURA: --s. Thank gods.

02:54:42.171 --> 02:54:43.270
MARISHA: You might have a mortar and--

02:54:43.271 --> 02:54:44.934
Does anyone have a mortar and pestle?

02:54:44.935 --> 02:54:49.193
SAM: I had an alchemy kit
before our stuff was stolen.

02:54:49.194 --> 02:54:50.760
MARISHA: Mm-mm.

02:54:50.761 --> 02:54:52.152
SAM: Unless I carry it on me?

02:54:52.153 --> 02:54:57.107
MATT: Nah, not to be stealthy. (laughs)

02:54:57.108 --> 02:54:58.374
LIAM: Just give me the fucking stone.

02:54:58.375 --> 02:55:00.634
MARISHA: I've got a
jeweler's kit that's got a file,

02:55:00.635 --> 02:55:01.901
but it's going to to take a minute

02:55:01.902 --> 02:55:02.744
for me to sit there and file it.

02:55:02.744 --> 02:55:03.737
MATT: Yeah, that'll take a while.

02:55:03.738 --> 02:55:05.284
LIAM: Take me five seconds to do.

02:55:05.285 --> 02:55:06.981
LAURA: Here.
MARISHA: Sorry, Caleb.

02:55:06.982 --> 02:55:09.635
LAURA: Here, here, here, here.

02:55:09.636 --> 02:55:12.812
MATT: ♪ Transmutation specialist! ♪

02:55:12.813 --> 02:55:15.190
TRAVIS and LIAM: (screechy grinding)

02:55:15.191 --> 02:55:17.096
TRAVIS: Broken Xerox. (groaning)

02:55:17.097 --> 02:55:19.519
MATT: Immediately (poof)
and it is opal dust.

02:55:19.520 --> 02:55:20.470
TALIESIN: Somewhere in Exandria,

02:55:20.471 --> 02:55:21.876
there's just a YouTube channel

02:55:21.877 --> 02:55:24.562
of people just taking
gems going (humming).

02:55:24.563 --> 02:55:26.028
Just like this in ASMR.

02:55:26.029 --> 02:55:27.111
TRAVIS: Oh, it's so relaxing.

02:55:27.112 --> 02:55:27.945
TALIESIN: Today, we're going to be doing

02:55:27.946 --> 02:55:30.075
a baseball-sized opal.
LIAM: Here's your tapioca powder, enjoy.

02:55:30.076 --> 02:55:31.425
MARISHA: Full hydraulic press channel.

02:55:31.426 --> 02:55:32.884
LAURA: I also need--

02:55:32.885 --> 02:55:34.725
MATT: (posh accent) "I spent at
least three hours last night

02:55:34.726 --> 02:55:36.732
"lost on ScryTube for like--"

02:55:36.733 --> 02:55:39.122
LIAM: 4th-level slot is gone.
MATT: "-- this incredible new channel."

02:55:39.123 --> 02:55:40.106
SAM: Okay, okay.

02:55:40.107 --> 02:55:42.138
LIAM: Ugh!
SAM: It's worth it, it's worth it.

02:55:42.139 --> 02:55:43.030
MARISHA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: I'd watch.

02:55:43.031 --> 02:55:45.614
MARISHA: Get ScryTube Premium, no ads.

02:55:45.615 --> 02:55:46.769
MATT: Nobody pays for that.
TRAVIS: I don't know what was said,

02:55:46.770 --> 02:55:49.196
but when they get down in this room,

02:55:49.197 --> 02:55:50.806
everything from the center of the room

02:55:50.807 --> 02:55:54.594
to the wall is toast for
the anti-magic cone.

02:55:54.595 --> 02:55:56.008
SAM: It's toast, what do you mean?

02:55:56.009 --> 02:55:58.927
TRAVIS: If he looks at you
all the way to the wall

02:55:58.928 --> 02:56:00.593
in a cone, you are in it.

02:56:00.594 --> 02:56:01.499
TALIESIN: Yep.

02:56:01.500 --> 02:56:03.080
LAURA: Yeah, so we have to avoid him.

02:56:03.081 --> 02:56:04.757
TRAVIS: The only advantage
to fighting outside

02:56:04.758 --> 02:56:06.386
would be that you have
unlimited distance.

02:56:06.387 --> 02:56:09.044
It is limited in here.
That's the biggest weak point.

02:56:09.045 --> 02:56:09.878
TALIESIN: Yep.
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

02:56:09.878 --> 02:56:10.801
LAURA: Yeah.

02:56:10.802 --> 02:56:13.435
But we also can set our arcane--

02:56:13.436 --> 02:56:17.519
We haven't done that yet,
the arcane magic things.

02:56:17.520 --> 02:56:18.403
MARISHA: That happens--

02:56:18.404 --> 02:56:19.986
LIAM: Those are for chucking
out during the fight.

02:56:19.987 --> 02:56:20.987
MARISHA: In the top of the fight,

02:56:20.988 --> 02:56:22.540
that's the first thing that happens.

02:56:22.541 --> 02:56:25.062
SAM: So if a fight goes down,
we have to get in that room

02:56:25.063 --> 02:56:26.879
and spread out.
LIAM: It's like Faerie Fire

02:56:26.880 --> 02:56:27.722
for his cone.

02:56:27.723 --> 02:56:29.742
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll put up
that gate at the entrance

02:56:29.743 --> 02:56:32.357
that is to the hallway and
put it at the other door

02:56:32.358 --> 02:56:34.403
at the other end so you
can hop back and forth.

02:56:34.404 --> 02:56:36.640
MARISHA: Yes.

02:56:36.641 --> 02:56:38.619
SAM: All right, is it
time to set the charges?

02:56:38.620 --> 02:56:39.486
LAURA and TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:56:39.486 --> 02:56:40.319
LIAM: What--

02:56:40.319 --> 02:56:41.268
LAURA: I'm going to go set the glyph.

02:56:41.269 --> 02:56:42.308
MARISHA: Glyph first.
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

02:56:42.309 --> 02:56:43.659
SAM: Whew. How do you get up there?

02:56:43.660 --> 02:56:45.579
LAURA: That's a good
question, Nott. Veth.

02:56:45.580 --> 02:56:47.518
Shit, I'm so sorry I
keep doing that! I'm so sorry!

02:56:47.519 --> 02:56:51.693
SAM: You can call me either.
It's fine, I don't care.

02:56:51.694 --> 02:56:55.361
Doesn't know my name.
We've been best friends for a year now.

02:56:56.252 --> 02:56:57.243
LAURA: Sorry.
TRAVIS: What about that detective agency?

02:56:57.244 --> 02:56:59.433
SAM: Do you want to just
climb up and do it?

02:56:59.434 --> 02:57:00.870
Isn't there a rope?

02:57:00.871 --> 02:57:02.332
LAURA: There isn't a rope
that comes all the way.

02:57:02.333 --> 02:57:03.957
Does it go all the way to the ground?

02:57:03.958 --> 02:57:05.503
MATT: Yeah, the rope goes
all the way to the ground.

02:57:05.504 --> 02:57:06.827
LAURA: Oh, but it's icy, isn't it?

02:57:06.828 --> 02:57:08.718
MATT: It has a layer of frost on it

02:57:08.719 --> 02:57:10.133
because it's been in this cold chamber.

02:57:10.134 --> 02:57:11.469
LIAM: What if you climb up the rope

02:57:11.470 --> 02:57:14.028
and a bunch of us just take
the bottom and walk it out

02:57:14.029 --> 02:57:16.886
as far as we can to try
to pull you closer to--

02:57:16.887 --> 02:57:17.891
MARISHA: That's a fun idea.

02:57:17.892 --> 02:57:18.875
LIAM: -- the ceiling?
TALIESIN: I actually like that.

02:57:18.876 --> 02:57:22.234
LAURA: I don't want to
accidentally pull off the rope

02:57:22.235 --> 02:57:24.459
and it comes--

02:57:24.460 --> 02:57:26.438
I'll just climb up the rope.

02:57:26.439 --> 02:57:27.688
SAM: Just climb up the rope.

02:57:27.689 --> 02:57:28.522
LIAM: Okay.
SAM: Yeah.

02:57:28.522 --> 02:57:29.496
ASHLEY: You'll be fine.

02:57:29.497 --> 02:57:30.935
MARISHA: We can always
guide you if you need it.

02:57:30.936 --> 02:57:32.872
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, thank you.

02:57:32.873 --> 02:57:35.978
MATT: Make an athletics check for me.

02:57:35.979 --> 02:57:37.303
LAURA: I'm scared of my dice.

02:57:37.304 --> 02:57:38.137
TRAVIS: Up the rope!

02:57:38.138 --> 02:57:39.774
LAURA: This isn't a good place to be.

02:57:39.775 --> 02:57:42.273
It's not good to be
scared of your own dice.

02:57:42.274 --> 02:57:44.239
MARISHA: Upper body strength.

02:57:44.240 --> 02:57:45.082
LAURA: Cool.

02:57:45.083 --> 02:57:46.794
TRAVIS: See? The dice
can feel your fear.

02:57:46.795 --> 02:57:48.114
LAURA: They can!

02:57:48.115 --> 02:57:49.667
TRAVIS: Giving them too much.

02:57:49.668 --> 02:57:51.943
LAURA: What is this, an acrobatics?
MATT: Athletics.

02:57:51.944 --> 02:57:54.413
LAURA: (laughs)

02:57:54.414 --> 02:57:55.247
10.

02:57:55.248 --> 02:57:57.744
TRAVIS: You're not even going to--

02:57:57.745 --> 02:57:58.875
SAM: A slippery rope.

02:57:58.876 --> 02:58:00.816
LAURA: Okay, who can cast Fly?

02:58:00.817 --> 02:58:02.591
Because this is a really slippery rope.

02:58:02.592 --> 02:58:03.934
MATT: So Jester gets about 10 feet up

02:58:03.935 --> 02:58:06.003
and you watch she's climbing it fine

02:58:06.004 --> 02:58:07.027
and you're feeling good. You're like,

02:58:07.028 --> 02:58:08.241
"Hell yeah, this rope is great."

02:58:08.242 --> 02:58:11.747
You guys are watching
her just stay in one spot.

02:58:11.748 --> 02:58:12.633
TRAVIS: The running man?

02:58:12.634 --> 02:58:15.076
MATT: Yep. She slides
as much as she climbs

02:58:15.077 --> 02:58:17.123
and is just staying at one height.

02:58:17.124 --> 02:58:17.957
TALIESIN: -- nightmare.

02:58:17.957 --> 02:58:18.790
(laughter)

02:58:18.791 --> 02:58:20.208
LAURA: This is really hard.

02:58:20.209 --> 02:58:21.125
LIAM: How much time do you need

02:58:21.126 --> 02:58:22.455
to cast it when you're there?

02:58:22.456 --> 02:58:23.751
LAURA: Let me find out.
MATT: One minute.

02:58:23.752 --> 02:58:25.201
LIAM: One minute.
LAURA: A minute.

02:58:25.202 --> 02:58:26.566
MARISHA: I like the little
groove you had going there.

02:58:26.567 --> 02:58:28.115
SAM: I can do it, I can get her up.

02:58:28.116 --> 02:58:29.672
LIAM: Okay, I was going to--

02:58:29.673 --> 02:58:32.416
SAM: I will levitate you straight up.

02:58:32.417 --> 02:58:33.259
ASHLEY: There we go.

02:58:33.260 --> 02:58:34.936
SAM: My spells are
less important than yours.

02:58:34.937 --> 02:58:36.026
TRAVIS: That have a range?

02:58:36.027 --> 02:58:37.133
MATT: In this instance,
it can be really important.

02:58:37.134 --> 02:58:39.984
LAURA: Let's make sure that
I'm in the exact right place.

02:58:39.985 --> 02:58:42.006
LIAM: Oh, I could do
that too with the staff

02:58:42.007 --> 02:58:44.391
which would recharge
even if I wasn't sleeping.

02:58:44.392 --> 02:58:45.364
SAM: Do that, then.

02:58:45.365 --> 02:58:46.602
LIAM: Yeah.

02:58:46.603 --> 02:58:47.957
SAM: You can do Levitate?

02:58:47.958 --> 02:58:49.561
LIAM: With Allura's staff, I can.

02:58:49.562 --> 02:58:50.909
SAM: Do it.

02:58:50.910 --> 02:58:51.743
LAURA: Okay.

02:58:51.744 --> 02:58:55.008
TALIESIN: Allura's Swiss army staff.

02:58:55.009 --> 02:58:56.035
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to get--

02:58:56.036 --> 02:58:56.869
MATT: By the way, have you been rolling

02:58:56.870 --> 02:58:59.155
for how many charges have come back?

02:58:59.156 --> 02:59:00.560
LIAM: Every day?
MATT: Yeah.

02:59:00.561 --> 02:59:02.951
LIAM: I haven't used it.
Yes, I have been.

02:59:02.952 --> 02:59:05.583
When I did, the last time
I rolled to refill it

02:59:05.584 --> 02:59:07.414
it did go to max.

02:59:07.415 --> 02:59:08.963
MATT: Okay.

02:59:08.964 --> 02:59:12.003
LIAM: And the last time I used
it was in the murder spree.

02:59:12.004 --> 02:59:12.837
MATT: Correct.
LIAM: In the sanitorium.

02:59:12.838 --> 02:59:14.502
MATT: Just double checking.
LIAM: It's been a couple of days.

02:59:14.503 --> 02:59:16.960
LAURA: Just crazy that it's
only been a couple of days.

02:59:16.961 --> 02:59:18.060
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: Mm-hmm.

02:59:18.061 --> 02:59:19.331
LAURA: It's been a busy few days.

02:59:19.332 --> 02:59:21.884
SAM: Okay, float her, come on,
we got to do this.

02:59:21.885 --> 02:59:23.377
I want to kill something tonight.

02:59:23.378 --> 02:59:26.514
MATT: And with that, as Caleb
holds the staff in front

02:59:26.515 --> 02:59:29.960
and guides it upward,
you feel yourself lifted up

02:59:29.961 --> 02:59:33.328
from within, some
sort of invisible energy

02:59:33.329 --> 02:59:36.265
almost seems to grab you
within the chest and lift you up.

02:59:36.266 --> 02:59:38.594
LAURA: Ooh, I feel like
it's grabbing my boobs.

02:59:38.595 --> 02:59:40.678
LIAM: That's not intentional!

02:59:41.828 --> 02:59:43.681
MATT: Inside.
(laughter)

02:59:43.682 --> 02:59:44.789
ASHLEY: The panic.
SAM: Must be Allura.

02:59:44.790 --> 02:59:46.171
MATT: But... sure.

02:59:46.172 --> 02:59:47.122
LIAM: No, no, no!

02:59:47.123 --> 02:59:48.441
ASHLEY: No, that's a total accident!

02:59:48.442 --> 02:59:50.906
TALIESIN: Henry Crabgrass
is going, "Hey."

02:59:50.907 --> 02:59:52.026
(laughter)

02:59:52.027 --> 02:59:53.869
MATT: (as Henry Crabgrass)
"I'm not okay with this."

02:59:53.870 --> 02:59:58.870
(laughter)

02:59:59.287 --> 03:00:00.736
TALIESIN: Sorry.

03:00:00.737 --> 03:00:03.466
MATT: "Now you were
supposed to be the one!

03:00:03.467 --> 03:00:05.139
"How could you do this to me?"

03:00:05.140 --> 03:00:10.140
As you begin to drift
upwards, eventually.

03:00:10.168 --> 03:00:11.076
ASHLEY: I miss him.

03:00:11.077 --> 03:00:13.700
MATT: Aw. Well, he's
out there somewhere.

03:00:13.701 --> 03:00:15.173
(laughter)

03:00:15.174 --> 03:00:16.894
You drift up towards the top

03:00:16.895 --> 03:00:20.372
and find yourself now
right within the base

03:00:20.373 --> 03:00:22.623
of that cavernous pit.

03:00:22.624 --> 03:00:26.881
LAURA: Okay, I'm going
to reach around (laughs)

03:00:26.882 --> 03:00:29.239
the edge of the lip

03:00:29.240 --> 03:00:30.793
of the cavern where it opens up.

03:00:30.794 --> 03:00:31.964
MATT: Mm-hmm.

03:00:31.965 --> 03:00:33.226
LAURA: And I'm going to try to find--

03:00:33.227 --> 03:00:35.025
Is it rocky, is it uneven?

03:00:35.026 --> 03:00:35.996
MATT: Yeah.

03:00:35.997 --> 03:00:38.525
LAURA: So I'm going to
go behind a rock that's

03:00:38.526 --> 03:00:41.426
dipped down, right, to where
it's hidden from the entrance?

03:00:41.427 --> 03:00:42.726
MATT: Easy enough to
find one there, yeah.

03:00:42.727 --> 03:00:46.463
LAURA: Okay, and I'm
going to cast the glyph

03:00:46.464 --> 03:00:47.517
I'll make it nice and small.

03:00:47.518 --> 03:00:48.410
MATT: So Symbol, the spell.

03:00:48.411 --> 03:00:50.746
LAURA: The Symbol, yes,
it's called Symbol.

03:00:50.747 --> 03:00:53.431
LIAM: What does the glyph look like?

03:00:53.432 --> 03:00:55.476
LAURA: Take a wild guess.

03:00:55.477 --> 03:00:56.836
LIAM: Is it a jagged dick?

03:00:56.837 --> 03:00:58.835
LAURA: (laughs) Doesn't
have to be jagged.

03:00:58.836 --> 03:01:00.226
It's nice and--
LIAM: But for pain!

03:01:00.227 --> 03:01:01.852
LAURA: Oh, right, that's true.

03:01:02.964 --> 03:01:03.849
MARISHA: Oh.

03:01:03.850 --> 03:01:06.186
LAURA: No, it was going to be nice.
MATT: That's some Bad Dragon shit.

03:01:06.187 --> 03:01:09.678
LAURA: It's a nice, smooth,
pretty, bubbly dick.

03:01:09.679 --> 03:01:10.570
MATT: All righty.

03:01:10.570 --> 03:01:11.486
MARISHA: -- American Horror Story--

03:01:11.487 --> 03:01:12.951
LIAM: It's going in,
but it's not coming out.

03:01:12.952 --> 03:01:14.892
LAURA: It's bubblegum pink
while I'm drawing it,

03:01:14.893 --> 03:01:17.517
but it's going to disappear
as soon as I'm done.

03:01:17.518 --> 03:01:19.873
(laughter)

03:01:19.874 --> 03:01:20.707
LAURA: What?
MARISHA: That's a Bad Dragon--

03:01:20.708 --> 03:01:22.081
TALIESIN: Nothing, carry on.

03:01:22.082 --> 03:01:25.388
MATT: Yep. (lip pop) All righty.

03:01:25.389 --> 03:01:28.246
LIAM: Yes, guys we know about
Bad Dragon. We have for years.

03:01:28.247 --> 03:01:30.384
(laughter)

03:01:30.385 --> 03:01:33.699
TRAVIS: "We have for years."
ASHLEY: We all have our own collection.

03:01:33.700 --> 03:01:35.190
MATT: We have a licensing deal coming up. Shh.
MARISHA: Bubble gum pink,

03:01:35.191 --> 03:01:36.928
with little purple swirls.

03:01:38.286 --> 03:01:41.052
TRAVIS: (telephone ring) What, who? Oh.

03:01:41.053 --> 03:01:43.646
MATT: [Inaudible] bed.
LAURA: Oh my god.

03:01:43.647 --> 03:01:45.223
MARISHA: Who would
take that sponsorship?

03:01:45.224 --> 03:01:47.242
ASHLEY: Make a Thordak--

03:01:47.243 --> 03:01:50.531
MATT: The Conclave deal?
Anyway, sorry. Sorry.

03:01:50.532 --> 03:01:51.689
Anyway.

03:01:51.690 --> 03:01:55.240
ASHLEY: I don't hate it, don't hate it.

03:01:55.241 --> 03:01:57.811
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.
MATT: So Jester?

03:01:57.812 --> 03:01:58.645
LAURA: Yes.

03:01:58.646 --> 03:01:59.800
MATT: You take the minute,

03:01:59.801 --> 03:02:02.197
which thankfully
there's no check required,

03:02:02.198 --> 03:02:04.032
because you are gently levitating

03:02:04.033 --> 03:02:06.897
for the process of casting
this minute-long spell.

03:02:06.898 --> 03:02:10.733
You finish your dick Symbol
on the back of this rock

03:02:10.734 --> 03:02:13.215
and it becomes mostly
invisible, facing outward

03:02:13.216 --> 03:02:16.015
from anyone who is or would be
transitioning down.

03:02:16.016 --> 03:02:17.901
So you are triggering it on what?

03:02:17.902 --> 03:02:21.345
LAURA: I'm triggering it
on anybody coming within--

03:02:21.346 --> 03:02:23.539
How wide is the opening here?

03:02:23.540 --> 03:02:25.525
MATT: Above is about 20 feet radius.

03:02:25.526 --> 03:02:27.503
And the rope is mostly
in the middle, so yeah.

03:02:27.504 --> 03:02:32.184
LAURA: Okay, so anybody
coming within 20 feet of it.

03:02:32.185 --> 03:02:35.293
MATT: Okay, got it. 20-foot radius.

03:02:35.294 --> 03:02:36.502
TALIESIN: No way past.

03:02:36.503 --> 03:02:37.937
LAURA: Right, they can't get past it.

03:02:37.938 --> 03:02:39.412
MATT: You got it.

03:02:39.413 --> 03:02:41.229
LAURA: And the trigger, yeah,

03:02:41.230 --> 03:02:44.140
so the trigger will be anybody
coming within range of it,

03:02:44.141 --> 03:02:46.208
but I will set a password on it.

03:02:46.209 --> 03:02:47.042
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: So that

03:02:47.043 --> 03:02:50.470
if we have to, you know,
if Caleb us to do the thing,

03:02:50.471 --> 03:02:52.379
so the password will be

03:02:56.567 --> 03:02:57.550
dick.

03:02:57.551 --> 03:02:58.685
(laughter)

03:02:58.686 --> 03:02:59.891
SAM: Good password.

03:02:59.892 --> 03:03:01.214
MATT: Would never have guessed.

03:03:01.215 --> 03:03:02.839
(laughter)
SAM: Very original!

03:03:02.840 --> 03:03:05.917
MATT: You're are full of
surprises, Ms. Bailey.

03:03:05.918 --> 03:03:07.784
LIAM: Know to get into Jester's iPhone.

03:03:07.785 --> 03:03:09.819
(laughter)

03:03:09.820 --> 03:03:10.728
MATT: Jester, nothing,

03:03:10.729 --> 03:03:13.033
it's how to get into Laura's--
LAURA: The password is 6969.

03:03:13.034 --> 03:03:15.867
(laughter)

03:03:17.072 --> 03:03:18.842
SAM: Her dog's name was Dick.

03:03:18.843 --> 03:03:21.235
(laughter)

03:03:21.236 --> 03:03:23.334
ASHLEY: Wait, did you say dick or thick?

03:03:24.467 --> 03:03:26.111
The second one?

03:03:26.112 --> 03:03:28.167
LAURA: No, I said dick.
ASHLEY: You said dick, okay.

03:03:28.168 --> 03:03:30.584
I really thought you said thick, sorry.

03:03:30.585 --> 03:03:32.703
(laughter)

03:03:32.704 --> 03:03:34.929
MATT: Benefit of the doubt.
That's so sweet.

03:03:34.930 --> 03:03:37.237
That's good friendship there.

03:03:37.238 --> 03:03:38.580
All right, so the password is "dick"

03:03:38.581 --> 03:03:39.814
for someone to not set the symbol off.

03:03:39.815 --> 03:03:40.880
TRAVIS: I'm glad we got that cleared up.

03:03:40.881 --> 03:03:42.494
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:03:42.495 --> 03:03:43.852
And it's--

03:03:43.853 --> 03:03:46.156
MATT: And what is the Symbol for?
LAURA: I'm setting it to be pain.

03:03:46.157 --> 03:03:47.015
MATT: Pain.

03:03:47.016 --> 03:03:48.988
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: Symbol of pain.

03:03:48.989 --> 03:03:50.571
SAM: Somebody send Yasha to go up there.

03:03:50.572 --> 03:03:51.508
SAM and ASHLEY: Thick.

03:03:51.509 --> 03:03:52.883
SAM: (explosion)
ASHLEY: Thick, it's okay!

03:03:52.884 --> 03:03:54.297
MATT: You got it.
SAM: (yell of pain)

03:03:54.298 --> 03:03:55.612
TRAVIS: Thick. (stammering) (explosion)

03:03:55.613 --> 03:03:56.446
MATT: Symbol of pain.

03:03:56.447 --> 03:03:59.107
LAURA: The password is "thick dick."

03:03:59.108 --> 03:04:00.465
And it's, yes, pain.

03:04:00.466 --> 03:04:01.303
MATT: Symbol of pain, got it.

03:04:01.303 --> 03:04:02.144
LIAM: Is that what it is?

03:04:02.145 --> 03:04:03.542
TALIESIN: Actually,
"thick dick" is not bad.

03:04:03.543 --> 03:04:05.005
LAURA: Well, you'll just
have to say it's all

03:04:05.006 --> 03:04:06.496
just in case, because you don't know.
LIAM: No, don't give me

03:04:06.497 --> 03:04:08.137
random things because
I'll blow myself up!

03:04:08.138 --> 03:04:09.951
SAM: Stick with the plan,
stick with the plan.

03:04:09.952 --> 03:04:11.677
LIAM: What is the password?

03:04:11.678 --> 03:04:13.076
SAM: It's dick.
LAURA: If you say thick dick

03:04:13.077 --> 03:04:14.967
you'll say the password, regardless.

03:04:14.968 --> 03:04:17.724
You'll definitely have password.

03:04:17.725 --> 03:04:19.036
Just say them both.

03:04:19.037 --> 03:04:21.050
SAM: We'll be fine.
Just keep going with the plan.

03:04:21.051 --> 03:04:22.081
I want to kill something.

03:04:22.082 --> 03:04:22.923
LAURA: Okay.

03:04:22.924 --> 03:04:24.204
MARISHA: (laughs)

03:04:24.205 --> 03:04:27.422
LAURA: So pain, then I'm
going to say: Hey, it's set.

03:04:27.423 --> 03:04:30.399
Please let me come back
down now, thank you.

03:04:30.400 --> 03:04:31.233
SAM: Oh.

03:04:31.234 --> 03:04:33.379
LAURA: I'm just floating.

03:04:33.380 --> 03:04:35.563
SAM: Can you levitate her down?

03:04:35.564 --> 03:04:37.195
LAURA: What, you just going
to make me fly up here

03:04:37.196 --> 03:04:38.087
all night? What's happening?

03:04:38.088 --> 03:04:40.226
LIAM: Sorry, I was thinking
about the password conundrum.

03:04:40.227 --> 03:04:41.592
Come on down.

03:04:41.593 --> 03:04:44.630
MATT: You slowly drift
back down onto your feet.

03:04:44.631 --> 03:04:46.530
MARISHA: Maybe if you say,
"dick thick dick,"

03:04:46.531 --> 03:04:47.364
just in case.

03:04:47.365 --> 03:04:48.846
LIAM: You are making
it worse, Beauregard.

03:04:48.847 --> 03:04:50.576
LAURA: It's dick, it's dick.
It's dick, Caleb.

03:04:50.577 --> 03:04:53.745
LIAM: Thank you. I need
everything in its place,

03:04:53.746 --> 03:04:55.521
and a place for every dick.

03:04:55.522 --> 03:04:58.409
ASHLEY: She was far away, so
I couldn't hear, you know?

03:04:58.410 --> 03:05:00.685
MARISHA: The echo, it's a
little echoey in this chamber,

03:05:00.686 --> 03:05:03.432
LAURA: Sorry. And I'm going to
keep it down just in case

03:05:03.433 --> 03:05:04.574
I'm not shouting "dick."

03:05:04.575 --> 03:05:07.731
I'm saying it quietly, just adamantly.

03:05:07.732 --> 03:05:08.686
MATT: You got it.

03:05:08.687 --> 03:05:10.518
TRAVIS: Quick pick a big thick dick to lick.
LAURA: Okay, so.

03:05:10.519 --> 03:05:13.429
Now that we have that
part taken care of,

03:05:13.430 --> 03:05:14.351
next step is--

03:05:14.352 --> 03:05:16.029
SAM: Intuit charges.

03:05:16.030 --> 03:05:16.863
LAURA: Yes.

03:05:16.864 --> 03:05:19.102
SAM: But first the tower?

03:05:19.103 --> 03:05:20.860
LAURA: And-- oh!
MARISHA: And the doors.

03:05:20.861 --> 03:05:22.517
LAURA: And amidst all of this stuff--

03:05:22.518 --> 03:05:25.067
Well, that will go up late.

03:05:25.068 --> 03:05:26.185
TRAVIS: That's moment of, yeah.

03:05:26.186 --> 03:05:27.189
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

03:05:27.190 --> 03:05:30.060
LAURA: We also need to
do a Heroes' Feast.

03:05:30.061 --> 03:05:31.887
LIAM: Well, you can
do that in the tower.

03:05:31.888 --> 03:05:34.028
LAURA: Yes, so you can
still come into the tower,

03:05:34.029 --> 03:05:36.157
we can leave the door
open just in casies,

03:05:36.158 --> 03:05:38.936
or we can have the feast
right outside of the tower?

03:05:38.937 --> 03:05:41.662
Because I thought you
weren't coming in the tower.

03:05:43.813 --> 03:05:44.987
MARISHA: You can eat and
then go to your post.

03:05:44.988 --> 03:05:46.370
LIAM: I can eat and go, <i>ja</i>.
LAURA: Yes.

03:05:46.371 --> 03:05:47.289
All right, cool.

03:05:47.290 --> 03:05:48.396
MARISHA: Yeah, dine and dash.

03:05:48.397 --> 03:05:49.522
LAURA: All right.
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

03:05:50.986 --> 03:05:52.731
TALIESIN: All right.

03:05:52.732 --> 03:05:53.839
SAM: It's going to be great.
TALIESIN: Let's have some food.

03:05:53.840 --> 03:05:56.559
LAURA: All right, who's
setting the charges?

03:05:56.560 --> 03:05:58.243
SAM: Essek, Caleb.

03:05:59.243 --> 03:06:00.076
TRAVIS and LAURA: Beau!
LIAM: Beauregard.

03:06:00.077 --> 03:06:01.333
LAURA: Oh, right.
SAM: Beau!

03:06:01.334 --> 03:06:04.912
MARISHA: And if you
could help me out, Jess.

03:06:04.913 --> 03:06:06.128
And Caduceus.

03:06:06.129 --> 03:06:08.061
A little bit of moral support.
LAURA: Oh man, I really hope we get to sleep,

03:06:08.062 --> 03:06:10.905
because all my spells
are gone, you guys.

03:06:10.906 --> 03:06:14.543
LAURA: Okay, yes, I'm going
to give you Enhance Ability.

03:06:14.544 --> 03:06:15.377
MARISHA: Thank you.

03:06:15.378 --> 03:06:18.347
LAURA: And I'm going to
give you-- what is arcana?

03:06:18.348 --> 03:06:20.115
Is intelligence?
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:06:21.707 --> 03:06:25.623
LAURA: Which means I'm
giving you Fox's Cunning.

03:06:26.878 --> 03:06:28.954
I'm going to draw
a beautiful little fox

03:06:28.955 --> 03:06:30.952
on your bicep right here.

03:06:30.953 --> 03:06:32.686
MARISHA: Aww, it's kind of cute.

03:06:32.687 --> 03:06:34.474
I like that. Could be a good tattoo.

03:06:34.475 --> 03:06:35.666
ASHLEY: Yeah, it would be a good tattoo.

03:06:36.723 --> 03:06:39.390
MARISHA: Okay. Are you blessing me, too?

03:06:40.673 --> 03:06:41.506
Thank you.

03:06:41.507 --> 03:06:42.664
LAURA: That's Guidance.

03:06:42.665 --> 03:06:44.837
MARISHA: Guidance.
TALIESIN: Guidance, yeah. d4.

03:06:44.838 --> 03:06:46.194
MATT: For one minute.

03:06:46.195 --> 03:06:47.118
SAM and MARISHA: One minute.

03:06:47.119 --> 03:06:50.042
MATT: "Are we to take these?
Where are we to set them up?"

03:06:50.043 --> 03:06:51.400
"Following your order."
LIAM: Let's do two

03:06:51.401 --> 03:06:53.533
over in the remnants of this tower

03:06:53.534 --> 03:06:56.529
and the rubble a bit away from it,

03:06:56.530 --> 03:07:00.543
and I will do one straight across.

03:07:00.544 --> 03:07:02.209
LAURA: The goal is to be within 60 feet

03:07:02.210 --> 03:07:03.746
of the middle of the room,

03:07:03.747 --> 03:07:06.565
but not 60 feet within the tunnel.

03:07:06.566 --> 03:07:07.673
MATT: "All right."

03:07:07.674 --> 03:07:11.754
Essek takes his
Frost Ray and clears out.

03:07:11.755 --> 03:07:12.588
SAM: Nice.

03:07:12.589 --> 03:07:14.442
MATT: A bunch of the--
SAM: Nice.

03:07:14.443 --> 03:07:15.803
MATT: Because if he has
to go back to set this,

03:07:15.804 --> 03:07:17.670
he's not about to set off

03:07:17.671 --> 03:07:21.013
a bunch of angry mold in his path.

03:07:21.014 --> 03:07:22.267
With that, he comes over

03:07:22.268 --> 03:07:25.469
and prepares to set his up over there.

03:07:25.470 --> 03:07:26.431
MARISHA: Okay.

03:07:26.432 --> 03:07:28.648
Is that within 60 feet?
Is that within 60 feet of the drop?

03:07:28.649 --> 03:07:30.757
TRAVIS: Off the center? Yeah.

03:07:32.143 --> 03:07:33.716
MATT: Yeah, 60 feet's about there.

03:07:33.717 --> 03:07:34.550
MARISHA: All right. Okay, okay.

03:07:34.551 --> 03:07:36.035
TRAVIS: If he stands in
the middle of the cave,

03:07:36.036 --> 03:07:37.477
everybody's fucked to the wall.

03:07:37.478 --> 03:07:39.060
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.
TRAVIS: In the cone of antimagic.

03:07:39.061 --> 03:07:40.465
MATT: All right, and then?

03:07:40.466 --> 03:07:41.977
LIAM: Before we do that,

03:07:41.978 --> 03:07:43.411
and we're going to
call out to each other

03:07:43.412 --> 03:07:44.983
when we're going to do this or whisper.

03:07:44.984 --> 03:07:46.013
MARISHA: Uh-huh.
LIAM: Stage whisper.

03:07:46.014 --> 03:07:49.424
I'm going to cast
Fortune's Favor on myself.

03:07:49.425 --> 03:07:51.470
MATT: Essek, of course,
casts it on himself as well.

03:07:51.471 --> 03:07:52.928
LIAM: Another slot gone.

03:07:52.929 --> 03:07:54.302
LAURA: Smart.
ASHLEY: Good, good.

03:07:54.303 --> 03:07:56.593
MARISHA: I really hope we get to sleep.

03:07:56.594 --> 03:07:58.001
Oh my god.

03:07:59.102 --> 03:08:01.452
LAURA: Otherwise, it's
going to be physical.

03:08:01.453 --> 03:08:02.286
MARISHA: (unsure sounds)

03:08:02.287 --> 03:08:04.262
MATT: Caleb, you said
you're climbing up here.

03:08:04.263 --> 03:08:05.835
LIAM: Oh, yeah, mm-hmm.

03:08:05.836 --> 03:08:07.454
LAURA: Amidst the rubble, but like--
LIAM: Amidst the rubble.

03:08:07.455 --> 03:08:08.630
LAURA: -- hidden as much as possible.

03:08:08.631 --> 03:08:10.411
LIAM: Yeah, and there's a
crack between the cavern

03:08:10.412 --> 03:08:13.180
and that wall that Caleb's
standing on so in there, <i>ja</i>.

03:08:13.181 --> 03:08:14.546
MATT: All right.
LIAM: So that it does not break.

03:08:14.547 --> 03:08:15.779
MATT: So that'll put
you right about there.

03:08:15.780 --> 03:08:17.775
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.
MATT: As you're setting it in that space.

03:08:17.776 --> 03:08:18.925
LAURA: And Beau, where are you?

03:08:18.926 --> 03:08:20.958
MARISHA: I'll do the-- oh god,

03:08:20.959 --> 03:08:23.722
I've got a bad view. Adjacent to--

03:08:23.723 --> 03:08:25.176
LAURA: Well, make sure it's not 60 feet

03:08:25.177 --> 03:08:26.173
within the tunnel entrance.

03:08:26.174 --> 03:08:27.688
MARISHA: But not-- yes.

03:08:27.689 --> 03:08:28.522
MATT: Over here?

03:08:28.523 --> 03:08:29.678
LAURA: So maybe on the opposite side.

03:08:29.679 --> 03:08:30.824
MATT: Opposite side?

03:08:30.825 --> 03:08:32.584
MARISHA: Oh, right because
we don't want to get hit.

03:08:32.585 --> 03:08:35.235
I did a Taliesin, I hit the monitor.

03:08:35.236 --> 03:08:36.744
TALIESIN: Wow.
MATT: So over here?

03:08:36.745 --> 03:08:39.454
MARISHA: So yeah,
maybe pocket it over here.

03:08:39.455 --> 03:08:41.355
MATT: Okay. Essek--
ASHLEY: You got called out!

03:08:42.347 --> 03:08:46.232
MATT: Essek will have to
burn away the the mold over there,

03:08:46.233 --> 03:08:47.255
because that's right in the
middle of a bunch of mold.

03:08:47.256 --> 03:08:49.124
TALIESIN: I feel like the mold hurts us

03:08:49.125 --> 03:08:51.149
more than it helps us
in this terrain, anyway.

03:08:51.150 --> 03:08:52.041
TRAVIS: Yeah, get rid of it.

03:08:52.042 --> 03:08:53.656
MATT: All right, so Essek goes and

03:08:53.657 --> 03:08:56.498
does a full clearing of this here,

03:08:57.420 --> 03:08:59.469
to make it a clean space
for you to work with.

03:08:59.470 --> 03:09:00.644
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:09:00.645 --> 03:09:02.816
It's just something for
us to get shoved into.

03:09:02.817 --> 03:09:04.330
LIAM: (like Henry Crabgrass)
Hey, buddy, ask first.

03:09:04.331 --> 03:09:05.315
SAM: Should I--

03:09:05.316 --> 03:09:08.682
Should I also bury a fluffernutter
somewhere around here?

03:09:08.683 --> 03:09:09.765
MARISHA: Like, right in
the center or something?

03:09:09.766 --> 03:09:12.915
SAM: Yeah. In case a fireball
goes off or something.

03:09:12.916 --> 03:09:13.969
LAURA: Ooh, yeah, we can like--

03:09:13.970 --> 03:09:16.359
Do we have any oil?
We can put oil in the middle.

03:09:16.360 --> 03:09:18.246
TRAVIS: We have one minute
to do this thing, you guys--

03:09:18.247 --> 03:09:20.170
MATT: Caleb, what level was the spell

03:09:20.171 --> 03:09:21.890
you cast to turn it into--?

03:09:21.891 --> 03:09:23.108
LIAM: Oh, that's 4th-level.

03:09:23.109 --> 03:09:24.942
MATT: 4th-level.
Go ahead and roll a d20 for me.

03:09:24.943 --> 03:09:25.776
LIAM: Okay.

03:09:26.789 --> 03:09:28.434
That is a two.

03:09:28.435 --> 03:09:30.150
MATT: Okay, you're fine.
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:09:30.151 --> 03:09:32.887
LAURA: Oh, Matt, do I need
to roll a d20 for my Symbol?

03:09:32.888 --> 03:09:35.490
MATT: Yes, you do. I keep
having to remember this stuff.

03:09:35.491 --> 03:09:38.076
So yeah, any spell 3rd-level or higher,

03:09:38.077 --> 03:09:39.242
just keep it in mind.

03:09:39.243 --> 03:09:40.076
LIAM: 3rd-level or higher?

03:09:40.077 --> 03:09:41.279
MATT: 3rd-level or higher for this.

03:09:41.280 --> 03:09:42.141
LAURA: Five.

03:09:42.141 --> 03:09:43.141
MATT: You're fine.

03:09:44.559 --> 03:09:46.367
LAURA: It's just a one or a 20, right?

03:09:46.368 --> 03:09:47.483
MATT: No.

03:09:47.484 --> 03:09:48.978
LAURA: Oh, we don't know what it is?

03:09:48.979 --> 03:09:51.410
MATT: Now you're in
Aeor proper. Shit get weirder.

03:09:51.411 --> 03:09:52.353
LAURA: Oh fuck.

03:09:52.354 --> 03:09:54.063
LIAM: Now it's weird.

03:09:54.064 --> 03:09:55.486
TRAVIS: Don't let it scare you.

03:09:55.487 --> 03:09:57.785
TALIESIN: Don't let it
spook you, we got a plan.

03:09:57.786 --> 03:09:58.619
MARISHA: We got a plan.

03:09:58.620 --> 03:10:00.168
TALIESIN: If we have to, we'll throw

03:10:00.169 --> 03:10:03.387
a fluffernutter, so that's the--

03:10:03.388 --> 03:10:05.264
MATT: So what are you doing?

03:10:05.265 --> 03:10:06.314
LIAM: Well, if we're going to do that,

03:10:06.315 --> 03:10:08.166
we need to do it before
we set the charges.

03:10:08.167 --> 03:10:10.508
MARISHA: Yes, and before I get--
LIAM: And it needs to be--

03:10:10.509 --> 03:10:14.759
Lucien can see.
It needs to be well concealed.

03:10:16.178 --> 03:10:17.461
SAM: Yeah, I'm confident.

03:10:17.462 --> 03:10:21.112
Yeah, I'll go to the middle
and I'll bury a bomb,

03:10:21.113 --> 03:10:23.159
loosely in the snow.

03:10:23.160 --> 03:10:23.993
Is it snow?

03:10:23.994 --> 03:10:25.055
No, it's not snow. We're not outside.

03:10:25.056 --> 03:10:26.344
MATT: It's ice and rubble.

03:10:26.345 --> 03:10:27.254
SAM: Ice and rubble.

03:10:27.255 --> 03:10:28.685
LIAM: So put a pile
with a little bit of--

03:10:28.686 --> 03:10:31.460
SAM: Yeah, rubble around.

03:10:31.461 --> 03:10:32.607
LIAM: And what sets it off?

03:10:32.608 --> 03:10:33.631
Us firing on it?

03:10:33.632 --> 03:10:35.856
SAM: You would have to set
it off with a Fireball.

03:10:35.857 --> 03:10:37.482
LIAM: I'm going to be
very far away, but--

03:10:37.483 --> 03:10:38.648
LAURA: Yeah, Fireball.

03:10:38.649 --> 03:10:39.990
TALIESIN: Well, remember the, yeah.

03:10:39.991 --> 03:10:41.256
ASHLEY: The intuits, I mean--
TALIESIN: Fire and Lucien

03:10:41.257 --> 03:10:42.547
don't necessarily--

03:10:42.548 --> 03:10:43.714
ASHLEY: Plus if the charges go--

03:10:43.715 --> 03:10:44.780
SAM: Is he immune to fire?

03:10:44.781 --> 03:10:46.324
TALIESIN: He gets-- it's half damage.

03:10:46.325 --> 03:10:47.309
LIAM: But he's got friends.

03:10:47.309 --> 03:10:48.270
MARISHA: I know, it's hard not to think

03:10:48.271 --> 03:10:50.752
about them like grenades.
SAM: It's just a maybe.

03:10:50.753 --> 03:10:52.476
LAURA: Nott, get out of
there after you do it

03:10:52.477 --> 03:10:53.667
as fast as you can.

03:10:53.668 --> 03:10:54.501
MATT: You doing it, Nott?

03:10:54.502 --> 03:10:56.060
MARISHA: We'll hear it go boom.

03:10:56.061 --> 03:11:00.146
SAM: Trying to make it look
very, very, very inconspicuous.

03:11:00.147 --> 03:11:00.980
MATT: Okay.

03:11:01.502 --> 03:11:04.501
MATT: This is a camouflaging-type scenario here;

03:11:04.502 --> 03:11:05.950
this would be a survival check for me.

03:11:05.951 --> 03:11:07.851
SAM: Survival check?
MATT: Correct.

03:11:07.852 --> 03:11:08.856
MARISHA: You're good at that.

03:11:08.857 --> 03:11:10.670
LAURA: Just put a plank of wood over it or something.

03:11:10.671 --> 03:11:12.745
SAM: I was thinking sleight of hand or something.

03:11:13.928 --> 03:11:15.201
MATT: Sleight of hand is being able to grab something

03:11:15.202 --> 03:11:18.121
without seeing. This is taking the space around you

03:11:18.122 --> 03:11:20.031
and carefully hiding something.

03:11:20.032 --> 03:11:21.481
SAM: Beauregard, come check my work.

03:11:21.482 --> 03:11:22.806
Oh wait, someone come check my work.

03:11:22.807 --> 03:11:24.431
LAURA: I have a plus five survival, I can --

03:11:24.432 --> 03:11:25.265
TRAVIS: Do you want me to come check your work?

03:11:25.266 --> 03:11:26.281
SAM: Someone come check my work.

03:11:26.282 --> 03:11:28.082
TRAVIS: I'll make sure it looks-- to a stranger's eyes.

03:11:28.083 --> 03:11:29.162
LAURA: Yeah, Fjord's good at checking.

03:11:29.163 --> 03:11:30.437
LIAM: Where you at?
MARISHA: Fjord's good at this.

03:11:30.438 --> 03:11:32.089
LIAM: Okay. Five, five.

03:11:32.090 --> 03:11:33.272
SAM: Anyone.
ASHLEY: Are we all five?

03:11:33.273 --> 03:11:35.611
MARISHA: Not as good as him.

03:11:35.612 --> 03:11:37.601
SAM: Yeah, that's a four.

03:11:37.602 --> 03:11:38.626
TRAVIS: I'm assisting you.

03:11:38.627 --> 03:11:39.826
SAM: Okay, what does that mean?

03:11:39.827 --> 03:11:41.298
MATT: Roll with advantage.

03:11:41.299 --> 03:11:42.476
MARISHA: Come on, come on bish.

03:11:42.477 --> 03:11:44.571
SAM: Oh, better. 11.

03:11:44.572 --> 03:11:46.811
MATT: Okay, you have hidden it

03:11:46.812 --> 03:11:48.631
somewhere in this space, you believe.

03:11:48.632 --> 03:11:49.939
LAURA: But Fjord is right there, can't you see

03:11:49.940 --> 03:11:52.019
that it's not hidden very well?

03:11:53.052 --> 03:11:54.352
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:11:56.372 --> 03:11:58.295
LIAM: Person who we don't want to perceive it--

03:11:58.296 --> 03:12:00.431
TRAVIS: 13.
LIAM: -- can see God.

03:12:00.432 --> 03:12:01.661
MATT: 13?

03:12:01.662 --> 03:12:02.911
I mean, it's not the best job,

03:12:02.912 --> 03:12:06.632
but it looks like some of the rubble around it.

03:12:06.633 --> 03:12:08.232
TRAVIS: Do you mind if I just

03:12:08.233 --> 03:12:10.911
take some of this loose ice and snow

03:12:10.912 --> 03:12:13.381
and maybe just cover up the brown of the barrel

03:12:13.382 --> 03:12:15.482
a little bit?
SAM: We could ditch this idea entirely.

03:12:15.483 --> 03:12:17.526
LAURA: Hide it behind some of the tower rubble,

03:12:17.527 --> 03:12:19.601
like hide it against the tower.

03:12:19.602 --> 03:12:20.933
Way easier to hide it over there.

03:12:20.934 --> 03:12:21.767
SAM: Okay.

03:12:21.768 --> 03:12:23.471
TALIESIN: The whole point is they're incapacitated

03:12:23.472 --> 03:12:24.581
on top of it, though.

03:12:24.582 --> 03:12:26.889
LAURA: Sure, but if-- sure.

03:12:29.052 --> 03:12:29.885
SAM: Ditch the idea.

03:12:29.886 --> 03:12:31.264
TRAVIS: Ditch it, take it back.
SAM: Ditching the idea.

03:12:31.265 --> 03:12:32.098
MATT: Okay.

03:12:32.099 --> 03:12:33.853
SAM: Not worth the risk.
TALIESIN: We're so good at this.

03:12:33.854 --> 03:12:35.061
MATT: (laughs)

03:12:35.062 --> 03:12:37.319
LIAM: So everyone except for Essek,

03:12:37.320 --> 03:12:39.141
you and I and Beauregard,

03:12:39.142 --> 03:12:42.325
please enter the hallway, salamander hall, now.

03:12:42.326 --> 03:12:43.183
MATT: All right.
TALIESIN: All right.

03:12:43.184 --> 03:12:44.851
MARISHA: Salamander Hall.
MATT: Everyone else is moving

03:12:44.852 --> 03:12:46.431
way over to the salamander hallway

03:12:46.432 --> 03:12:48.091
where the intersection is.

03:12:48.092 --> 03:12:48.972
Got it.

03:12:48.973 --> 03:12:51.581
You all shift over there while the three of you,

03:12:51.582 --> 03:12:54.911
of which Beauregard only has eyeline with Caleb

03:12:54.912 --> 03:12:57.241
and Caleb only has an eyeline to Essek.

03:12:57.242 --> 03:13:01.241
You're all clutching one of these three intuit charges,

03:13:01.242 --> 03:13:03.031
looking over the intricate designs

03:13:03.032 --> 03:13:04.231
that are scrolled into it.
MARISHA: So we'll follow you.

03:13:04.232 --> 03:13:07.181
LIAM: I'm going to to call <i>eins, zwei, drei,</i>

03:13:07.182 --> 03:13:11.281
and then you do it and if it doesn't work, take it with you.

03:13:11.282 --> 03:13:12.556
MARISHA: Do we go on <i>drei</i> or do we go

03:13:12.557 --> 03:13:15.128
on the imaginary four?
LIAM: You go on <i>drei</i>.

03:13:15.129 --> 03:13:16.653
<i>Eins, zwei</i>--

03:13:16.654 --> 03:13:17.494
MARISHA and LIAM: <i>Drei</i>.

03:13:17.494 --> 03:13:18.327
MARISHA: Okay.

03:13:18.328 --> 03:13:19.510
MATT: All right.
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

03:13:20.482 --> 03:13:21.452
Okay. Here we go.

03:13:21.453 --> 03:13:23.891
MARISHA: Oh shit, okay!

03:13:23.892 --> 03:13:24.921
LAURA: You get advantage.

03:13:24.922 --> 03:13:26.211
MARISHA: I get advantage and a d4.
TRAVIS: You've been studying

03:13:26.212 --> 03:13:28.105
your whole life for this.

03:13:28.106 --> 03:13:32.576
LIAM: <i>Eins, zwei, drei</i>.

03:13:32.577 --> 03:13:34.535
MATT: You all at once press into it.

03:13:35.489 --> 03:13:36.701
MARISHA: Thank god.

03:13:36.702 --> 03:13:39.231
MATT: He's going to go ahead and take his re-roll.

03:13:39.232 --> 03:13:40.202
SAM: Re-roll?

03:13:40.203 --> 03:13:42.305
LAURA: Oh yeah, because he did a Fortune's Favor.

03:13:43.702 --> 03:13:45.331
LIAM: 27.

03:13:45.332 --> 03:13:46.322
SAM: Ooh, pretty good.

03:13:46.323 --> 03:13:47.501
MATT: 22.

03:13:47.502 --> 03:13:48.560
MARISHA: 22.

03:13:48.561 --> 03:13:50.418
(cheering)

03:13:50.419 --> 03:13:52.951
MARISHA: That advantage was everything!

03:13:52.952 --> 03:13:56.201
MATT: At once, you all together, click, release

03:13:56.202 --> 03:13:58.411
and set down and they all drift to the ground.

03:13:58.412 --> 03:14:00.962
And at first there's a moment of like, "Did it work?"

03:14:02.002 --> 03:14:04.901
Then you watch as all of the various grooves throughout

03:14:04.902 --> 03:14:08.511
the different moving plates pulse with a dull blue-green

03:14:08.512 --> 03:14:11.401
light, a one time, a second time

03:14:11.402 --> 03:14:13.561
and it begins to lift off the ground.

03:14:13.562 --> 03:14:15.527
"All right, move. Everyone move!"

03:14:15.528 --> 03:14:16.673
LIAM: ♪ Hup hup hey ho hey ho hi ♪

03:14:16.674 --> 03:14:20.681
MATT: You all begin to run rapidly out this way.

03:14:20.682 --> 03:14:23.601
Essek gliding through the ruin.

03:14:23.602 --> 03:14:24.684
Caleb rushing.

03:14:24.685 --> 03:14:27.250
Caleb, I'm going to need you to go ahead and--

03:14:27.251 --> 03:14:28.323
LIAM: You fucker.

03:14:28.324 --> 03:14:31.291
MATT: You're up a bunch of rocks and ruin, dude!

03:14:31.292 --> 03:14:32.535
LIAM: Still a fucker. What do you want?

03:14:32.536 --> 03:14:35.685
(laughter)

03:14:35.686 --> 03:14:37.831
MATT: Make an athletics or acrobatics check, your choice.

03:14:37.832 --> 03:14:39.211
LIAM: Athletics or acrobatics?

03:14:39.212 --> 03:14:40.901
Those are my strong suits.
MATT: I know.

03:14:40.902 --> 03:14:43.428
LIAM: Acrobatics. Oh, good, five.

03:14:43.429 --> 03:14:44.971
LAURA: Did you use your Fortune's Favor already?

03:14:44.972 --> 03:14:45.813
LIAM: No.

03:14:48.468 --> 03:14:49.721
13.

03:14:49.722 --> 03:14:54.721
MATT: 13, you stumble a bit and hit a loose rock,

03:14:54.722 --> 03:14:57.041
fall, but manage to go into your tumble

03:14:57.042 --> 03:14:59.910
and catch back on the ground and keep running.

03:14:59.911 --> 03:15:00.744
MARISHA: Yo.

03:15:00.745 --> 03:15:02.078
MATT: You slow down a little bit.
TRAVIS: He's throwing

03:15:02.079 --> 03:15:04.942
the grenade, it falls down behind him.

03:15:04.943 --> 03:15:06.311
MATT: It slows you down a bit and the other two,

03:15:06.312 --> 03:15:08.528
as you get up, are like, "Come on, come on, come on."

03:15:08.529 --> 03:15:11.391
And you catch up to them at about the 20 or so second mark

03:15:11.392 --> 03:15:13.041
cause you did take a bit of a tumble

03:15:13.042 --> 03:15:16.891
but, now you have another 30 seconds before these set

03:15:16.892 --> 03:15:18.951
and you feel like you can make the distance without issue.

03:15:18.952 --> 03:15:20.883
MARISHA: Faster. Go. Move.

03:15:20.884 --> 03:15:24.221
MATT: As the three of you immediately exit the chamber

03:15:24.222 --> 03:15:26.171
looking behind, you watch as all three at once,

03:15:26.172 --> 03:15:28.912
just a slight half second from each other, go

03:15:28.913 --> 03:15:31.351
(arcane whirring)

03:15:31.352 --> 03:15:34.961
and then just gently, quietly floating.

03:15:34.962 --> 03:15:36.291
MARISHA: Oh my god.

03:15:36.292 --> 03:15:39.514
LIAM: Now, full disclosure, for the (stammering) Inuit--

03:15:39.515 --> 03:15:41.559
MATT: Intuit charge.
LIAM: Damn it, intuit charge.

03:15:41.560 --> 03:15:42.721
MARISHA: I fucked everyone up.

03:15:42.722 --> 03:15:44.816
MATT: Yeah, Marisha set you on a dark path.

03:15:44.817 --> 03:15:47.421
LIAM: I rolled both dice at the same time thinking advantage

03:15:47.422 --> 03:15:49.191
when it's supposed to be one and then you can

03:15:49.192 --> 03:15:51.171
choose the other one, but both those dice--

03:15:51.172 --> 03:15:53.501
so if you want to fudge about what I just did,

03:15:53.502 --> 03:15:56.051
but both my rolls were high.

03:15:56.052 --> 03:15:57.871
So if I had gone with either one of those.

03:15:57.872 --> 03:15:59.541
It was supposed to be one roll,

03:15:59.542 --> 03:16:01.201
and then Fortune's Favor is if you're like,

03:16:01.202 --> 03:16:02.921
"Shit, I didn't do it," re-roll.

03:16:02.922 --> 03:16:05.601
I just went (boom), but they were both really high.

03:16:05.602 --> 03:16:07.845
So if you want me to fall down there, I will.

03:16:08.712 --> 03:16:10.211
MATT: Wait, so...

03:16:10.212 --> 03:16:11.045
TRAVIS: He rolled two dice

03:16:11.046 --> 03:16:12.521
for the set intuit charge--
LIAM: On the roll for the--

03:16:12.522 --> 03:16:13.462
TRAVIS: -- instead of one.
MATT: Oh, got you.

03:16:13.462 --> 03:16:14.295
LIAM: -- intuit charge,

03:16:14.296 --> 03:16:17.131
I rolled two d20s at one time.
LAURA: But both were super high.

03:16:17.132 --> 03:16:20.531
Neither one was low.
LIAM: Thinking, "I'm rolling at advantage."

03:16:20.532 --> 03:16:22.691
MATT: If you did that, then you would have tumbled.

03:16:22.692 --> 03:16:24.001
LIAM: Well, let's tumble, then.

03:16:24.002 --> 03:16:27.471
MATT: Okay. So Caleb tumbles a bit and gets his foot

03:16:27.472 --> 03:16:30.481
lodged in some of the rocks there.

03:16:30.482 --> 03:16:33.111
MARISHA: You-- Oh shit!

03:16:33.112 --> 03:16:33.972
SAM: Go get him!

03:16:33.973 --> 03:16:38.527
MARISHA: Okay. Can I see this happen
as I'm power walking by?

03:16:38.528 --> 03:16:41.061
LAURA: "Power walking." (laughs)

03:16:41.062 --> 03:16:44.701
LIAM: I will ignite the boots I have

03:16:44.702 --> 03:16:45.931
and fly the fuck out of there.

03:16:45.932 --> 03:16:48.047
SAM: Oh.
MATT: Okay.

03:16:48.048 --> 03:16:50.001
So as Essek and Beauregard turn around

03:16:50.002 --> 03:16:52.757
and notice that he's stuck, you go ahead and

03:16:52.758 --> 03:16:53.811
charge them and, as you do,

03:16:53.812 --> 03:16:55.341
for a moment, you're about to turn and go help him

03:16:55.342 --> 03:16:58.649
before he just like Cannonball of the X-Men, just

03:16:58.650 --> 03:17:00.349
(roaring sound)

03:17:00.350 --> 03:17:03.103
takes off and charges past both of you,

03:17:03.942 --> 03:17:06.321
into the chamber before, catching onto your feet.

03:17:06.322 --> 03:17:08.029
And now he's ahead of both of you.

03:17:08.030 --> 03:17:11.248
MARISHA: (stammer) Let's go. Essek, let's go.

03:17:11.249 --> 03:17:12.082
Okay, come on.

03:17:12.083 --> 03:17:13.821
MATT: "It was interesting. Indeed."

03:17:13.822 --> 03:17:15.891
And he floats quickly alongside you as you all--

03:17:15.892 --> 03:17:20.461
He's a little slower, but nevertheless you all manage to

03:17:20.462 --> 03:17:21.832
convene with the rest of the group.

03:17:21.833 --> 03:17:23.471
Thank you for being honest about that.

03:17:23.472 --> 03:17:25.791
LIAM: I wasn't sure. I was like, what do I do? What do I do?

03:17:25.792 --> 03:17:27.921
MATT: No worries.
ASHLEY: (laughs) It must be nice.

03:17:27.922 --> 03:17:29.231
MATT: All right.

03:17:29.232 --> 03:17:31.501
So you all gather.

03:17:31.502 --> 03:17:34.685
The charges set, the Symbol's set.

03:17:35.862 --> 03:17:38.181
You are all now at the intersection.

03:17:38.182 --> 03:17:39.771
What do you do?

03:17:39.772 --> 03:17:42.330
LIAM: Burn another fucking spell slot, apparently.

03:17:44.122 --> 03:17:45.768
LAURA: We need to do Heroes' Feast.

03:17:45.769 --> 03:17:47.141
SAM: And the tower?

03:17:47.142 --> 03:17:48.471
LIAM: Well, you mean, I might as well do tower

03:17:48.472 --> 03:17:51.321
because another creature could come.

03:17:51.322 --> 03:17:53.251
So it's better that we have the door to shut.

03:17:53.252 --> 03:17:54.561
LAURA: Yeah.

03:17:54.562 --> 03:17:55.395
LIAM: Hold on.

03:17:56.372 --> 03:17:58.862
Frumpkin, white.
MATT: (meows)

03:17:58.863 --> 03:18:00.246
LIAM: A cat is here.

03:18:01.332 --> 03:18:05.181
So will you sit just within the hallway here?

03:18:05.182 --> 03:18:07.241
And if you hear anything or see anything,

03:18:07.242 --> 03:18:08.075
please come let me know.

03:18:08.076 --> 03:18:10.661
I'm going to leave the door to the tower open over here.

03:18:10.662 --> 03:18:13.071
So you just come over to me

03:18:13.072 --> 03:18:15.101
and let me know if you see anything, okay.

03:18:15.102 --> 03:18:17.781
If I'm inside, you might not be able to talk to me.

03:18:17.782 --> 03:18:18.762
Things get weird.

03:18:18.763 --> 03:18:21.535
TALIESIN: Weird question, does the
cat know how to shut the door?

03:18:22.542 --> 03:18:24.080
LIAM: Well, he does not have opposable thumbs.

03:18:24.081 --> 03:18:26.283
TALIESIN: No, I mean, just--

03:18:26.284 --> 03:18:28.551
LIAM: Well, he could try.

03:18:28.552 --> 03:18:30.576
TALIESIN: Just curious.
MATT: (uncertain meow)

03:18:30.577 --> 03:18:32.322
ASHLEY: He could lift with his tail.

03:18:32.323 --> 03:18:34.891
LAURA: Let's make the tower so I can set up this feast.

03:18:34.892 --> 03:18:37.061
TRAVIS: We should also tell the rangers outside

03:18:37.062 --> 03:18:40.331
that if the coast is clear to make sure there aren't

03:18:40.332 --> 03:18:42.041
any tracks leading into the entrance

03:18:42.042 --> 03:18:44.401
to the crawl space, just in case we were messy.

03:18:44.402 --> 03:18:45.521
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:18:45.522 --> 03:18:48.072
TRAVIS: Especially if they're good at covering up tracks.

03:18:49.082 --> 03:18:51.911
MARISHA: Especially after we murdered some giants.

03:18:51.912 --> 03:18:54.072
So I'm sure we left a trace.

03:18:54.073 --> 03:18:54.906
MATT: Yeah.

03:18:55.742 --> 03:18:57.103
You tried to cover--

03:18:57.104 --> 03:18:58.191
MARISHA: We did a little, right?

03:18:58.192 --> 03:19:00.871
MATT: Yeah. Essek goes ahead and relays the message

03:19:00.872 --> 03:19:03.821
and, "They're going to do what they can."

03:19:03.822 --> 03:19:06.091
LAURA: Okay. Tower?

03:19:06.092 --> 03:19:10.641
LIAM: Yeah. I shove the wand into some loose rubble,

03:19:10.642 --> 03:19:12.041
in front of a section of the wall

03:19:12.042 --> 03:19:13.921
and lay out the bits of glass

03:19:13.922 --> 03:19:17.491
and, in moments, just laid within the wall,

03:19:17.492 --> 03:19:19.505
like I've cut a rectangle in the wall.

03:19:21.382 --> 03:19:22.640
MATT: "Impressive."

03:19:24.552 --> 03:19:26.601
LIAM: Come inside, you should see it.

03:19:26.602 --> 03:19:27.911
MATT: "But of course."

03:19:27.912 --> 03:19:32.131
LAURA: I go inside and immediately
start casting Heroes' Feast.

03:19:32.132 --> 03:19:33.831
MATT: All right. Roll me a d20 please.

03:19:33.832 --> 03:19:34.792
LIAM: Yeah.

03:19:34.793 --> 03:19:36.931
LAURA: Does it count if you're in--

03:19:36.932 --> 03:19:38.051
MARISHA: A pocket dimension?
LIAM: Ten.

03:19:38.052 --> 03:19:38.885
MATT: Okay. You're fine.

03:19:38.886 --> 03:19:40.341
LAURA: If I'm in the pocket dimension,

03:19:40.342 --> 03:19:44.051
do I still have to roll the d20 for the Heroes' Feast?

03:19:44.052 --> 03:19:45.461
MATT: You'll find out.

03:19:45.462 --> 03:19:46.781
LAURA: I cast Heroes' Feast.

03:19:46.782 --> 03:19:47.615
MATT: Within the tower?

03:19:47.616 --> 03:19:48.631
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: You're fine.

03:19:48.632 --> 03:19:50.339
LAURA: (sigh of relief) Okay, good.

03:19:50.340 --> 03:19:51.640
TALIESIN: Good to know.

03:19:52.582 --> 03:19:56.161
LAURA: Okay. That uses the jeweled chalice

03:19:56.162 --> 03:19:57.901
that we bought.
LIAM: So tense.

03:19:57.902 --> 03:20:00.571
LAURA: Oh, I do, I have two jewel chalices, look at that.

03:20:00.572 --> 03:20:02.131
MATT: All right, how long does it take to cast?

03:20:02.132 --> 03:20:02.965
LAURA: 10 minutes.

03:20:02.966 --> 03:20:04.241
MATT: 10 minutes to cast, all righty.

03:20:04.242 --> 03:20:05.311
And then it's an hour to eat?

03:20:05.312 --> 03:20:06.995
LAURA: Yes.
MATT: You got it, all right--

03:20:06.996 --> 03:20:10.563
SAM: While she's casting, I'm going
to stick my head out of the--

03:20:10.564 --> 03:20:12.571
is anyone out of the tower?

03:20:12.572 --> 03:20:13.405
TRAVIS: I'm out.

03:20:13.405 --> 03:20:14.238
SAM: You're out?

03:20:14.238 --> 03:20:15.071
Okay, good.

03:20:16.352 --> 03:20:17.851
MATT: Okay, you're keeping watch?

03:20:17.852 --> 03:20:18.881
TRAVIS: Yeah. I'm full up.

03:20:18.882 --> 03:20:20.761
I mean, I'll take a short rest whenever it's available,

03:20:20.762 --> 03:20:22.451
but that's all I need for now.

03:20:22.452 --> 03:20:24.081
TALIESIN: You got to eat the Heroes' Feast, though, but --

03:20:24.082 --> 03:20:24.915
TRAVIS: Yes.

03:20:24.916 --> 03:20:26.531
MARISHA: I can also be on sentry duty.

03:20:26.532 --> 03:20:29.388
I have full hit points and full ki points, so.

03:20:29.389 --> 03:20:31.281
SAM: Well, we just need one person out there.

03:20:31.282 --> 03:20:32.115
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah,

03:20:32.116 --> 03:20:34.671
I'm just saying I can trade off with you, maybe.

03:20:34.672 --> 03:20:37.131
TRAVIS: You want the hallway or the roof?

03:20:37.132 --> 03:20:39.461
You're more perceptive than I am, right?

03:20:39.462 --> 03:20:41.331
MARISHA: I have a plus four to my perception.

03:20:41.332 --> 03:20:43.123
I have a really high passive perception.

03:20:43.124 --> 03:20:44.501
TRAVIS: I just asked about your perception.

03:20:44.502 --> 03:20:45.365
It's okay.

03:20:45.366 --> 03:20:47.001
(laughs)

03:20:47.002 --> 03:20:48.502
We're actually about the same.

03:20:49.522 --> 03:20:50.781
We'll trade off.

03:20:50.782 --> 03:20:53.121
MARISHA: Okay.
MATT: All right.

03:20:53.122 --> 03:20:55.261
So as this is happening, Essek walks

03:20:55.262 --> 03:20:56.862
into the tower and looks around.

03:20:59.212 --> 03:21:02.035
"This is quite impressive.

03:21:02.902 --> 03:21:04.295
"Is this of your own design?"

03:21:05.720 --> 03:21:10.191
LIAM: Yeah, I've spent several months tinkering on it.

03:21:10.192 --> 03:21:13.321
It's for these chuckleheads.

03:21:13.322 --> 03:21:16.831
Look though, this is your influence.

03:21:16.832 --> 03:21:20.192
Pointing at the stained glass window devoted to Dunamancy.

03:21:21.662 --> 03:21:24.149
MATT: "Happy to contribute to an otherwise

03:21:25.592 --> 03:21:27.515
"prominent Zemnian influence.

03:21:28.712 --> 03:21:29.545
"But,

03:21:30.482 --> 03:21:31.701
"truth be told,

03:21:31.702 --> 03:21:35.151
"the better elements of Zemnian architecture."

03:21:35.152 --> 03:21:39.805
LIAM: In the best of all choices, there would be less,

03:21:41.012 --> 03:21:43.025
less walls between us in general.

03:21:44.922 --> 03:21:46.715
Some day, some century, maybe.

03:21:48.002 --> 03:21:48.835
MATT: "Maybe."

03:21:50.442 --> 03:21:53.169
LIAM: Thank you for coming with us this far.

03:21:53.170 --> 03:21:54.970
We could all very well die tomorrow.

03:21:55.994 --> 03:21:58.144
MATT: "Well, isn't that the truth of every day, though?"

03:21:59.722 --> 03:22:00.555
LIAM: Hmm.

03:22:01.472 --> 03:22:02.813
All right, well.

03:22:02.814 --> 03:22:04.525
LAURA: Essek, what's your favorite food?

03:22:05.442 --> 03:22:06.275
MATT: "Me?"

03:22:06.275 --> 03:22:07.108
LAURA: Yeah!

03:22:08.753 --> 03:22:10.891
MATT: "I don't believe anyone's
ever asked me that question."

03:22:10.892 --> 03:22:13.473
SAM: You seem like a crepe person.

03:22:13.474 --> 03:22:14.307
LAURA: Ooh.

03:22:15.792 --> 03:22:17.562
MATT: "Interestingly enough, I'm...

03:22:20.314 --> 03:22:22.214
"and I hope this does not sound strange,

03:22:23.732 --> 03:22:25.795
"I'm a fan of simple soups.

03:22:27.192 --> 03:22:29.026
"Stews."

03:22:29.027 --> 03:22:30.371
LAURA: Really?

03:22:30.372 --> 03:22:31.541
Stews?

03:22:31.542 --> 03:22:33.071
Okay.

03:22:33.072 --> 03:22:35.525
Like beef stew?

03:22:37.055 --> 03:22:40.525
MATT: "Robust inclusion of all
sorts of flavors and herbs, yes."

03:22:41.632 --> 03:22:43.881
LAURA: Okay, sure.

03:22:43.882 --> 03:22:44.991
TALIESIN: That sounds nice.
LAURA: Doesn't really go

03:22:44.992 --> 03:22:47.349
with the cakes and the waffles,

03:22:47.350 --> 03:22:49.382
but sure.
SAM: Soup and cake?

03:22:49.383 --> 03:22:51.217
LAURA: Yeah, it could be stew.
SAM: ♪ Cake'in' my way ♪

03:22:51.218 --> 03:22:53.792
LAURA: In--! (laughs)

03:22:53.793 --> 03:22:55.451
In bread bowls.

03:22:55.452 --> 03:22:56.285
MARISHA: Oh, hell yeah.

03:22:56.286 --> 03:22:58.391
LAURA: Stews for everyone.

03:22:58.392 --> 03:23:00.782
Oh, nice deep red wines

03:23:00.783 --> 03:23:01.857
to go with stews.
LIAM: So you like a good crock pot.

03:23:01.858 --> 03:23:03.212
LAURA: That sounds wonderful.

03:23:03.213 --> 03:23:04.046
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:23:04.047 --> 03:23:05.301
Now we know what to get him for Christmas.

03:23:05.302 --> 03:23:06.811
LAURA: Nice crispy bugs.

03:23:06.812 --> 03:23:09.871
ASHLEY: There we go, a little bit of spice, flavor.

03:23:09.872 --> 03:23:12.231
LAURA: Veggie cous cous

03:23:12.232 --> 03:23:14.731
and some veggie dishes.
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm already there.

03:23:14.732 --> 03:23:15.565
Excellent.

03:23:15.566 --> 03:23:17.353
LAURA: Roasted carrots. Yum.

03:23:17.354 --> 03:23:18.187
MARISHA: Mm.

03:23:19.145 --> 03:23:21.208
TALIESIN: Veggie stew goes great.
LAURA: Fjord?

03:23:21.209 --> 03:23:23.500
TRAVIS: Stew's good.
LAURA: Stew's good?

03:23:25.642 --> 03:23:27.461
TALIESIN: Clam chowder.
SAM: Some fish for him.

03:23:27.462 --> 03:23:28.943
LAURA: Some calamari.

03:23:28.944 --> 03:23:32.371
(laughter)

03:23:32.372 --> 03:23:33.731
SAM: Got some rosé, I'm fine.

03:23:33.732 --> 03:23:35.595
LAURA: Okay. And Caleb?

03:23:36.804 --> 03:23:39.883
LIAM: Oh, um, spaetzies.

03:23:39.884 --> 03:23:40.717
LAURA: I don't know what <i>spaetzies</i> are.

03:23:40.718 --> 03:23:42.511
LIAM: <i>Spaetzles</i>, uh...
SAM: <i>Spaetzle.</i>

03:23:42.512 --> 03:23:44.565
LIAM: It's Zemnian, it's a noodle--

03:23:46.761 --> 03:23:48.790
SAM: It's like a doughy noodle.
LIAM: Noodles, yeah.

03:23:48.791 --> 03:23:50.340
SAM: Like a--

03:23:50.341 --> 03:23:52.306
LIAM: Zemnian.
SAM: -- German--

03:23:52.307 --> 03:23:53.905
LIAM: What?
SAM: Sorry.

03:23:55.572 --> 03:23:58.751
LAURA: Doughy noodles. I'm going to really try to--

03:23:58.752 --> 03:24:00.045
LIAM: You know you could just go with a good schnitzel.

03:24:00.046 --> 03:24:01.361
SAM: Like a German gnocchi.

03:24:01.362 --> 03:24:02.981
LAURA: Yes, I do a good schnitzel.

03:24:02.982 --> 03:24:05.161
Definitely, that's what it will be then.

03:24:05.162 --> 03:24:06.032
LIAM: That's a different thing.

03:24:06.033 --> 03:24:08.271
That is like a breaded cutlet of chicken.

03:24:08.272 --> 03:24:10.301
LAURA: Oh, okay, yeah, I could do that.

03:24:10.302 --> 03:24:11.368
LIAM: Okay.

03:24:11.369 --> 03:24:14.001
MARISHA: (laughs)

03:24:14.002 --> 03:24:15.529
LAURA: Schnitzel it is.

03:24:15.530 --> 03:24:16.363
TRAVIS: If you're doing breaded chicken,

03:24:16.364 --> 03:24:17.562
I mean, I'll take a fish and chips

03:24:17.563 --> 03:24:19.411
if we're breading, like if we're frying.

03:24:19.412 --> 03:24:20.623
LIAM: Oh, you're into role play.

03:24:20.624 --> 03:24:22.063
LAURA: I'll make you a fish and chips.

03:24:22.064 --> 03:24:24.911
I'm just going to make it like the biggest fucking feast.

03:24:24.912 --> 03:24:27.451
Everybody's favorite food.

03:24:27.452 --> 03:24:29.931
Enough for everybody else to try.

03:24:29.932 --> 03:24:30.765
You know what I mean?

03:24:30.766 --> 03:24:32.302
Like giant family style.

03:24:32.303 --> 03:24:35.451
LIAM: It's like Sizzler, all you
can eat, 50 different things.

03:24:35.452 --> 03:24:36.521
LAURA: Yes.

03:24:36.522 --> 03:24:37.355
SAM: Weird buffet.

03:24:37.355 --> 03:24:38.188
LAURA: Complete--

03:24:38.189 --> 03:24:39.941
Oh yeah, totally gross buffet.

03:24:39.942 --> 03:24:43.181
None of it goes together, but it all looks really lovely.

03:24:43.182 --> 03:24:44.781
Because it's on really beautiful,

03:24:44.782 --> 03:24:47.539
like a tea party sort of plates.

03:24:47.540 --> 03:24:49.082
Different levels.
SAM: Pizza. Some sushi.

03:24:49.083 --> 03:24:50.957
TRAVIS: Can you also make some Zantac 75?
LAURA: Yeah.

03:24:50.958 --> 03:24:53.271
LIAM: Some mandarin oranges in a bowl.

03:24:53.272 --> 03:24:55.192
SAM: Corn.

03:24:55.193 --> 03:24:58.946
MATT: "Are you alright with me looking around?

03:24:58.947 --> 03:25:01.095
"I'm just curious to see the space."

03:25:03.732 --> 03:25:05.198
LAURA: Just be back in 10 minutes, Essek,

03:25:05.199 --> 03:25:06.916
'cause this takes an hour to eat.

03:25:06.917 --> 03:25:08.331
SAM: And don't go on the 8th floor.

03:25:08.332 --> 03:25:10.631
MATT: "I don't see any stairs. Is there a particular--"

03:25:10.632 --> 03:25:12.080
MARISHA: Oh, just--
SAM: Up!

03:25:12.081 --> 03:25:13.402
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:25:13.403 --> 03:25:14.761
MATT: "Up!

03:25:14.762 --> 03:25:15.595
"Whoa."

03:25:15.596 --> 03:25:18.625
MARISHA: You have to say it like that every time, though.

03:25:19.562 --> 03:25:21.621
MATT: "Magic is a very specific--"

03:25:21.622 --> 03:25:24.248
MARISHA: A hundred percent.

03:25:24.249 --> 03:25:26.411
MATT: And as he drifts up through the center,

03:25:26.412 --> 03:25:27.625
looking around,

03:25:28.792 --> 03:25:31.792
nodding with a slight smile to the side of his face.

03:25:34.222 --> 03:25:35.841
But yeah, so.

03:25:35.842 --> 03:25:37.981
LIAM: Who's doing sentry right now?

03:25:37.982 --> 03:25:38.815
SAM: Fjord's outside.

03:25:38.816 --> 03:25:41.634
LIAM: So sentry means getting ready to slam the door shut,

03:25:41.635 --> 03:25:42.804
if you hear--

03:25:42.805 --> 03:25:44.321
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.
TRAVIS: "Ow!"

03:25:44.322 --> 03:25:45.155
LIAM: Okay.

03:25:46.102 --> 03:25:48.751
All right, if that's the case, I will follow up, too.

03:25:48.752 --> 03:25:49.821
I'm not going to take long,

03:25:49.822 --> 03:25:52.601
but I'll give him the highlights of the place.

03:25:52.602 --> 03:25:53.660
MATT: All right.

03:25:58.222 --> 03:26:01.321
Have you rearranged the space since last time you--

03:26:01.322 --> 03:26:02.451
made an architectural change?
LIAM: Oh, yeah.

03:26:02.452 --> 03:26:03.285
All the--

03:26:03.286 --> 03:26:05.031
LAURA: Not the hot tub, leave the hot tub.

03:26:05.032 --> 03:26:07.587
LIAM: It folds into the closets.
LAURA: Okay.

03:26:09.682 --> 03:26:11.940
LIAM: This place follows logic and reason.

03:26:13.380 --> 03:26:14.305
TRAVIS: Design.

03:26:15.852 --> 03:26:18.380
Intentional design.

03:26:19.322 --> 03:26:21.957
MARISHA: That was the better version, let's be real.

03:26:23.955 --> 03:26:26.901
LIAM: We enlarged-- I'm sorry, go ahead.

03:26:26.902 --> 03:26:28.721
MATT: "Continuing this path, it would not be long

03:26:28.722 --> 03:26:32.085
"until you are creating your own permanent demi-plane."

03:26:34.616 --> 03:26:36.878
LIAM: Do you fuck with that at all?

03:26:36.879 --> 03:26:38.181
LAURA: (laughs)

03:26:38.182 --> 03:26:39.921
LAURA: "Do you fuck with that?"

03:26:39.922 --> 03:26:44.318
MATT: "I would like to eventually...
fuck with demi-planes, yes.

03:26:44.319 --> 03:26:48.965
"But I'm still expanding my research."

03:26:50.605 --> 03:26:51.831
LIAM: Here.

03:26:51.832 --> 03:26:55.101
We are pressed for time, so let me show you one room

03:26:55.102 --> 03:26:57.764
in particular that you would appreciate.

03:26:57.765 --> 03:26:58.873
MATT: "Please, lead on."

03:26:59.792 --> 03:27:00.824
LIAM: You don't have to say "up."

03:27:00.825 --> 03:27:03.151
You just have to think it.

03:27:03.152 --> 03:27:04.452
MATT: "It is fun to say, though."

03:27:05.798 --> 03:27:06.688
LIAM: It's true.

03:27:07.642 --> 03:27:08.475
Up.

03:27:08.475 --> 03:27:09.308
MATT: "Up."

03:27:10.512 --> 03:27:12.261
LIAM: So we'll just continue to spiral up

03:27:12.262 --> 03:27:17.121
and pass by library, bed chambers, more bed chambers.

03:27:17.122 --> 03:27:18.571
This is where we eat.

03:27:18.572 --> 03:27:19.622
There's lots of pies.

03:27:21.347 --> 03:27:23.571
This area is complicated.

03:27:23.572 --> 03:27:27.891
And then I will mutter my few words of Zemnian

03:27:27.892 --> 03:27:29.891
to the entrance to the ninth floor

03:27:29.892 --> 03:27:33.951
and float him up into the chamber full of stars

03:27:33.952 --> 03:27:36.785
and possibility and illusion.

03:27:38.047 --> 03:27:40.703
MATT: "Ah, indeed, I see the inspiration for this chamber

03:27:40.704 --> 03:27:44.395
"is strongly worn on your sleeve.

03:27:50.142 --> 03:27:52.725
"Already a quick student of Dunamancy, are you?"

03:27:54.892 --> 03:27:58.057
LIAM: I have taken your lessons to heart.

03:28:01.702 --> 03:28:04.009
MATT: "You spoke once of intent,

03:28:06.002 --> 03:28:08.220
"lot of fortunes have changed since.

03:28:11.562 --> 03:28:12.675
"What is your goal?

03:28:14.712 --> 03:28:15.787
"Ultimately?"

03:28:26.372 --> 03:28:29.055
LIAM: I think my priorities have mostly shifted

03:28:30.442 --> 03:28:33.975
since we last spoke about things like this.

03:28:37.252 --> 03:28:40.052
I think what's going on right now is more important than

03:28:42.212 --> 03:28:44.383
my petty, earthly grievances.

03:28:49.172 --> 03:28:54.172
Still very much fascinated with and attracted to

03:28:56.072 --> 03:28:59.529
ability and skill.

03:28:59.530 --> 03:29:03.785
And it's not fashionable to say, but to power.

03:29:06.462 --> 03:29:09.295
Who doesn't feel the tug of such a thing?

03:29:11.235 --> 03:29:12.068
But, uh--

03:29:14.244 --> 03:29:15.481
yeah, I said it knowing what your reaction

03:29:15.482 --> 03:29:16.831
was going to be.

03:29:16.832 --> 03:29:19.015
I see you outside.

03:29:19.016 --> 03:29:21.674
(laughs)

03:29:24.780 --> 03:29:25.904
But it doesn't matter.

03:29:25.905 --> 03:29:27.645
There are bigger things than you and I.

03:29:31.102 --> 03:29:32.652
MATT: "I think that's the key.

03:29:37.502 --> 03:29:40.531
"The pursuit of magic, in the ways that we know it,

03:29:40.532 --> 03:29:42.991
"in the ways that we've been disparately,

03:29:42.992 --> 03:29:45.375
"but in some ways similarly raised and studied.

03:29:47.552 --> 03:29:52.405
"At a certain point, it becomes about the self.

03:29:54.232 --> 03:29:58.907
"It becomes about what <i>I</i> can do.

03:30:05.282 --> 03:30:09.662
"And it's impressive that you've deviated

03:30:10.762 --> 03:30:11.915
"at your skill level.

03:30:13.002 --> 03:30:14.052
"I just hope it holds."

03:30:15.132 --> 03:30:16.482
LIAM: That's the key, isn't it?

03:30:18.842 --> 03:30:20.511
Because if you were to put the very thing

03:30:20.512 --> 03:30:22.811
that I have wondered about for so many years in front of me,

03:30:22.812 --> 03:30:25.125
I'm really not sure what my reaction would be.

03:30:26.512 --> 03:30:27.812
MATT: "You're still very young."

03:30:31.502 --> 03:30:33.571
LIAM: You've been around a while longer.

03:30:33.572 --> 03:30:34.405
MATT: "A bit.

03:30:35.732 --> 03:30:40.640
"I know what pursuits of

03:30:42.073 --> 03:30:44.414
"the mysteries of magic can bring.

03:30:46.412 --> 03:30:47.245
"Good and bad.

03:30:49.562 --> 03:30:52.031
"The fact that you can acknowledge this path gives me hope,

03:30:52.032 --> 03:30:52.865
"but...

03:30:55.862 --> 03:30:56.695
"well..."

03:31:01.165 --> 03:31:04.765
LIAM: The one thing that has stayed true though, is that I--

03:31:08.022 --> 03:31:12.062
well, I carry a lot of sins, like you do.

03:31:12.063 --> 03:31:13.855
MATT: "Not anywhere like I do."

03:31:16.242 --> 03:31:17.192
LIAM: Don't be so sure.

03:31:19.392 --> 03:31:21.642
MATT: Looks down to catch your attention.

03:31:22.902 --> 03:31:25.115
"I'm pretty sure, young man."

03:31:28.375 --> 03:31:30.242
LIAM: I will take you at your word.

03:31:37.102 --> 03:31:41.193
Everything that I worked for for so many years was to

03:31:43.993 --> 03:31:45.401
atone.

03:31:49.152 --> 03:31:50.252
And I still want that.

03:31:51.852 --> 03:31:55.632
I'm just questioning if there is only one

03:31:57.072 --> 03:31:58.405
path to that atonement.

03:32:02.804 --> 03:32:03.637
I don't

03:32:05.712 --> 03:32:08.070
fool myself into thinking that I will

03:32:11.002 --> 03:32:12.941
absolve myself of those things.

03:32:12.942 --> 03:32:17.535
But I think-- I think that if I do enough,

03:32:20.122 --> 03:32:21.922
I can at least carry it more easily.

03:32:22.882 --> 03:32:24.082
Do you know what I mean?

03:32:26.250 --> 03:32:27.525
MATT: "I think I do.

03:32:32.816 --> 03:32:33.649
"Well."

03:32:35.875 --> 03:32:38.442
LIAM: You know what a bunch of wizards in one place is?

03:32:41.012 --> 03:32:42.025
Fucking trouble.

03:32:43.194 --> 03:32:44.794
MATT: "(lightly laughs)"

03:32:48.062 --> 03:32:51.091
MATT: "Well, if nature and history has taught us anything,

03:32:51.092 --> 03:32:54.568
"eventually, it's just one left."

03:32:58.416 --> 03:33:00.824
LIAM: Come on, let's go down.

03:33:01.955 --> 03:33:03.881
LAURA: I shout up: food's ready!

03:33:03.882 --> 03:33:06.451
MATT: (laughs)

03:33:06.452 --> 03:33:09.611
You all come to the majestic spread that Jester

03:33:09.612 --> 03:33:11.931
has magically produced for you.

03:33:11.932 --> 03:33:13.761
All manner of flavors and scents.

03:33:13.762 --> 03:33:17.775
An odd mixture of all kinds of delicacies.

03:33:19.092 --> 03:33:20.821
MARISHA: Everything's fried!

03:33:20.822 --> 03:33:22.221
LAURA: Not everything, no, no, no, no, no,

03:33:22.222 --> 03:33:24.651
there's veggies, there's veggies and stew.

03:33:24.652 --> 03:33:25.602
It's not all fried.
TALIESIN: I'm up for fried food,

03:33:25.603 --> 03:33:26.711
it's just fried veggies.

03:33:26.712 --> 03:33:27.545
It's great.

03:33:27.546 --> 03:33:29.752
MARISHA: What I love is all fried.

03:33:29.753 --> 03:33:31.352
(laughter)

03:33:31.353 --> 03:33:32.501
MARISHA: This is great.

03:33:32.502 --> 03:33:34.251
LAURA: There's lots of desserts, too.

03:33:34.252 --> 03:33:36.091
MATT: "This is actually quite delicious, thank you."

03:33:36.092 --> 03:33:36.925
LAURA: You're welcome.

03:33:36.926 --> 03:33:38.138
MARISHA: Deep fried Oreos.

03:33:39.289 --> 03:33:40.515
LAURA: Oh so good!

03:33:42.669 --> 03:33:44.700
ASHLEY AND MARISHA: Deep fried Twinkies.

03:33:44.701 --> 03:33:48.048
SAM: I'll eat fast and then go tell Fjord.

03:33:48.049 --> 03:33:50.001
Why don't you go in and eat?

03:33:50.002 --> 03:33:51.461
LAURA: Yeah. Because it only lasts for an hour

03:33:51.462 --> 03:33:52.584
and everybody has to eat in an hour.

03:33:52.585 --> 03:33:53.671
So you guys have to come in and eat.

03:33:53.672 --> 03:33:54.781
We can just do it with the door open.

03:33:54.782 --> 03:33:56.301
SAM: Swap.
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:33:56.302 --> 03:33:58.011
MARISHA: Okay, yeah.
MATT: All right.

03:33:58.012 --> 03:34:00.061
LIAM: Total buffet style, Sizzler.

03:34:00.062 --> 03:34:03.075
MATT: Your meal is quickly received.

03:34:04.622 --> 03:34:06.991
The hour of conversation and enjoyment of it

03:34:06.992 --> 03:34:09.001
comes to a conclusion.

03:34:09.002 --> 03:34:10.311
Seemingly uneventful.

03:34:10.312 --> 03:34:12.661
LAURA: Sprinkle's gorging himself.

03:34:12.662 --> 03:34:13.495
MATT: Oh yes.

03:34:13.495 --> 03:34:14.482
Desperately hungry.

03:34:14.483 --> 03:34:17.011
SAM: First meal in months.

03:34:17.012 --> 03:34:18.575
MARISHA: Since the last Heroes' Feast.

03:34:19.412 --> 03:34:22.511
LAURA: So at the end of it, if we, you know,

03:34:22.512 --> 03:34:24.831
aren't dead by the end of the meal.

03:34:24.832 --> 03:34:25.672
MARISHA: Great.

03:34:25.673 --> 03:34:28.301
LAURA: Everybody gets two d10 additional hit points.

03:34:28.302 --> 03:34:29.543
MARISHA: Oh yeah, that's right.

03:34:29.544 --> 03:34:32.181
LAURA: And the maximum also increases by two d10,

03:34:32.182 --> 03:34:33.791
so you can get healed beyond--

03:34:33.792 --> 03:34:34.625
MARISHA: Above that.

03:34:34.626 --> 03:34:36.241
Do you roll for that or do we roll individually?

03:34:36.242 --> 03:34:39.293
LAURA: I think I'll roll the d10s, I imagine.

03:34:39.294 --> 03:34:41.611
And everybody just gets it?
LIAM: I roll so good though, okay.

03:34:41.612 --> 03:34:43.781
LAURA: I mean, unless-- how do you want to do it?

03:34:43.782 --> 03:34:47.591
Do you want everybody to roll individual or me to roll it?

03:34:47.592 --> 03:34:49.121
MATT: Actually, you should roll for this.

03:34:49.122 --> 03:34:50.641
And everybody gets that amount.

03:34:50.642 --> 03:34:51.951
That's the best way to do it.

03:34:51.952 --> 03:34:53.431
LAURA: Okay I'm sorry, cause I usually--

03:34:53.432 --> 03:34:57.185
MARISHA: Roll fucking big.
MATT: That's okay.

03:34:58.150 --> 03:35:00.851
LAURA: (rolls tongue)

03:35:00.852 --> 03:35:02.605
MARISHA: Big money.

03:35:02.606 --> 03:35:04.497
No.

03:35:04.498 --> 03:35:05.452
LIAM: Two? Is it two?

03:35:05.453 --> 03:35:06.818
Is it three?
LAURA: It's two.

03:35:06.819 --> 03:35:08.559
(laughter)

03:35:08.560 --> 03:35:09.851
TRAVIS: Wait, like, one and a one?

03:35:09.852 --> 03:35:10.822
MARISHA: You rolled two ones?

03:35:10.823 --> 03:35:13.052
MATT: Oh, Laura, but you know what?

03:35:13.053 --> 03:35:14.185
TRAVIS: Did you really?

03:35:14.186 --> 03:35:15.055
You rolled two ones?

03:35:15.056 --> 03:35:16.244
MARISHA: Holy shit.

03:35:16.245 --> 03:35:19.341
LAURA: Beebee, I rolled two ones.

03:35:19.342 --> 03:35:21.631
LIAM: Man, the 14 I rolled is so much better than two.

03:35:21.632 --> 03:35:22.701
MATT: Hey, you know what though?

03:35:22.702 --> 03:35:23.535
MARISHA: Two.

03:35:23.536 --> 03:35:25.219
MATT: How many times does it come
down to one or two hit points?

03:35:25.220 --> 03:35:27.911
SAM: That's true.
MARISHA: Yeah, true, we'll take it.

03:35:27.912 --> 03:35:29.711
LAURA AND MARISHA: It could have been 20.

03:35:29.712 --> 03:35:31.311
MATT: It could have been.

03:35:31.312 --> 03:35:33.521
But at least everyone's also immune to poison,

03:35:33.522 --> 03:35:35.371
they're immune to fear.

03:35:35.372 --> 03:35:36.901
LAURA: I'm sorry.

03:35:36.902 --> 03:35:38.380
MARISHA: Immune to fear is huge because

03:35:38.381 --> 03:35:40.341
didn't he pull that shit on us a decent amount

03:35:40.342 --> 03:35:42.021
when we fought him last, Lucien?

03:35:42.022 --> 03:35:44.511
TALIESIN: Immunity to poison--

03:35:44.512 --> 03:35:49.512
SAM: We 10 more HP, higher modifier, something?

03:35:49.912 --> 03:35:50.745
What is it?

03:35:51.823 --> 03:35:54.521
No, no, no, but you said your hit point max goes up?

03:35:54.522 --> 03:35:55.355
Oh, by two.

03:35:55.356 --> 03:35:57.202
LAURA: By two!
SAM: Oh, okay.

03:35:58.313 --> 03:36:00.405
MATT: Damn it, Sam!

03:36:00.406 --> 03:36:01.976
Just talked her from the edge.

03:36:01.977 --> 03:36:02.984
ASHLEY: Two hit points.

03:36:02.985 --> 03:36:04.861
We have immunity to poison and fear.

03:36:04.862 --> 03:36:05.695
MARISHA: Which is huge.

03:36:05.696 --> 03:36:07.450
ASHLEY: That's great.
LAURA: And you get--

03:36:07.451 --> 03:36:08.974
(heavy sigh)

03:36:08.975 --> 03:36:12.111
You get advantage on
wisdom saving throws.

03:36:12.112 --> 03:36:13.509
ASHLEY: That's huge.
LAURA: Which is good.

03:36:13.510 --> 03:36:15.655
MATT: That's incredible.

03:36:17.007 --> 03:36:19.801
All right.
MARISHA: On wisdom.

03:36:19.802 --> 03:36:22.615
LAURA: What a fucking joke!

03:36:22.616 --> 03:36:26.511
LIAM: No, it's not, wisdom advantage is huge.

03:36:26.512 --> 03:36:28.544
MARISHA: That's honestly the most important part.

03:36:28.545 --> 03:36:31.108
MATT: Yeah, the hit points is
just like a side bonus.

03:36:31.109 --> 03:36:33.621
MARISHA: They're the croutons
on top of this salad.

03:36:33.622 --> 03:36:35.791
LIAM: Plus you won a BAFTA.

03:36:35.792 --> 03:36:37.841
MARISHA and ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:36:37.842 --> 03:36:38.675
MATT: You're fine.

03:36:38.676 --> 03:36:40.119
SAM: Weeks ago.

03:36:40.120 --> 03:36:42.037
MARISHA: Max made us margies.

03:36:44.116 --> 03:36:45.090
MATT: All right.
MARISHA: Weeks ago.

03:36:45.091 --> 03:36:47.905
LIAM: Win a BAFTA every week or shut the fuck up.

03:36:47.906 --> 03:36:49.989
(laughter)

03:36:53.022 --> 03:36:54.101
MATT: All right.

03:36:54.102 --> 03:36:56.221
So the meals are complete.

03:36:56.222 --> 03:37:00.225
You take the boons of the divine meal you've received.

03:37:01.062 --> 03:37:01.942
What now?

03:37:01.943 --> 03:37:04.321
LAURA: I immediately lay down
like a Sumo wrestler

03:37:04.322 --> 03:37:05.431
and try to go to sleep.

03:37:05.432 --> 03:37:06.956
LIAM: Ooh.
TALIESIN: Take a nap.

03:37:06.957 --> 03:37:08.301
TRAVIS: We'll open the door again.

03:37:08.302 --> 03:37:09.411
MATT: Okay, door is open.

03:37:09.412 --> 03:37:10.521
MARISHA: I'll be on rotation with Fjord.

03:37:10.522 --> 03:37:12.431
TRAVIS: But do we hear anything?

03:37:12.432 --> 03:37:13.851
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:37:13.852 --> 03:37:16.013
TRAVIS: Assist or roll as well?

03:37:16.014 --> 03:37:18.061
LIAM: I need to-- yeah.

03:37:18.062 --> 03:37:22.201
I need to set the dome up
300 feet away from

03:37:22.202 --> 03:37:23.938
inuit charges immediately.

03:37:23.939 --> 03:37:24.951
TRAVIS: Great, go.
MARISHA: I'll roll, I'll roll.

03:37:24.952 --> 03:37:26.391
LIAM: But I don't want to
wander off by myself.

03:37:26.392 --> 03:37:28.392
SAM: I will go with you.
LIAM: Okay.

03:37:31.096 --> 03:37:34.081
MARISHA: Oh god, I hope you rolled
something better than I did.

03:37:34.082 --> 03:37:34.915
TRAVIS: 19.

03:37:34.916 --> 03:37:37.511
MARISHA: Okay, good. I rolled a nine.

03:37:37.512 --> 03:37:38.751
MATT: Okay.

03:37:38.752 --> 03:37:41.471
The two of you, walking the perimeter of the nearby hallway

03:37:41.472 --> 03:37:42.925
around this intersection.

03:37:45.922 --> 03:37:47.031
It feels pretty safe.

03:37:47.032 --> 03:37:48.351
You don't hear any additional noise,

03:37:48.352 --> 03:37:49.661
anything that catches your attention.

03:37:49.662 --> 03:37:54.015
It's as still as you
expected, or hoped, at least.

03:37:54.016 --> 03:37:54.849
MARISHA: Okay.

03:37:54.850 --> 03:37:57.001
SAM: We're walking towards
the Praesidis Ward.

03:37:57.002 --> 03:37:58.910
LIAM: Yes.
MATT: How far back?

03:38:00.032 --> 03:38:04.681
LIAM: So we know that from
the places where we set those charges

03:38:04.682 --> 03:38:07.491
that it's at least 70 feet to the arch.

03:38:07.492 --> 03:38:10.781
So we can then game out that
we need another 230 feet

03:38:10.782 --> 03:38:13.281
and with Keen Mind,
I think that we could hold hands

03:38:13.282 --> 03:38:16.181
and take steps and go one, two, three

03:38:16.182 --> 03:38:20.451
and figure out the max for what
300 feet would be in this.

03:38:20.452 --> 03:38:23.811
MATT: It would be
partially up the incline.

03:38:23.812 --> 03:38:25.281
LIAM: That's fine.

03:38:25.282 --> 03:38:28.251
And so I will go an extra 15 feet.

03:38:28.252 --> 03:38:30.185
SAM: To the top of the incline.

03:38:31.472 --> 03:38:33.171
LIAM: As close to the bottom as I can be

03:38:33.172 --> 03:38:36.059
while being outside of 300 feet.

03:38:36.060 --> 03:38:39.431
SAM: I don't think we want to
sit on incline, we'll slide down.

03:38:39.432 --> 03:38:41.848
MATT: Yeah. It's a pretty harsh angle.

03:38:42.782 --> 03:38:44.511
LIAM: The further back we go, though.

03:38:44.512 --> 03:38:47.331
SAM: I know, but how are
we going to stay here?

03:38:47.332 --> 03:38:49.498
We're on a slope. It's 45 degrees.

03:38:49.499 --> 03:38:51.141
MATT: There is rubble and stuff there.

03:38:51.142 --> 03:38:52.461
There's maybe a place that you could--

03:38:52.462 --> 03:38:55.081
the two of you could
maybe just try and sit

03:38:55.082 --> 03:38:57.171
and make it work, but it's
going to be precarious.

03:38:57.172 --> 03:38:59.321
LIAM: Well, I also have to
cast the damn spell.

03:38:59.322 --> 03:39:00.511
SAM: Okay. Go for it.

03:39:00.512 --> 03:39:02.131
If we can find a spot.

03:39:02.132 --> 03:39:03.432
MARISHA: How long is the incline?

03:39:04.942 --> 03:39:05.892
TRAVIS: About 20.

03:39:05.893 --> 03:39:07.971
MARISHA: It's long, right?
MATT: It's pretty long.

03:39:07.972 --> 03:39:10.388
LIAM: I don't want to go
an extra hundred feet away.

03:39:10.389 --> 03:39:11.538
We'll never make it.

03:39:11.539 --> 03:39:13.776
SAM: Try to dig out a spot.

03:39:13.777 --> 03:39:16.321
LIAM: Ritually cast the hut here.

03:39:16.322 --> 03:39:17.931
MATT: Just two of you, one of you being a halfling,

03:39:17.932 --> 03:39:18.819
I think that'll--

03:39:20.092 --> 03:39:21.002
Make a perception check.

03:39:21.003 --> 03:39:23.621
LIAM: We've slept on top of
each other before;

03:39:23.622 --> 03:39:24.455
we're not even going to sleep.

03:39:24.456 --> 03:39:27.371
18 plus-- 27.

03:39:27.372 --> 03:39:30.591
MATT: Yeah, following the rope
that's still dangling there

03:39:30.592 --> 03:39:33.851
as an aid, you can easily
find a bit of broken rubble

03:39:33.852 --> 03:39:35.871
that can support your weight together.

03:39:35.872 --> 03:39:37.331
It's not the most comfortable space,

03:39:37.332 --> 03:39:40.251
but you can definitely
sit and feel like you can

03:39:40.252 --> 03:39:42.598
at least not slide down
and possibly set up the dome.

03:39:42.599 --> 03:39:45.081
LIAM: And I actually take the
rope and just, not knot it,

03:39:45.082 --> 03:39:46.851
but give it like a one circle around

03:39:46.852 --> 03:39:48.149
so that it's like a little,

03:39:48.150 --> 03:39:51.351
just a little bit of holding
me in place while I cast.

03:39:51.352 --> 03:39:53.551
So I will take the time to cast the dome

03:39:53.552 --> 03:39:55.032
and I will release Frumpkin

03:39:56.342 --> 03:40:01.342
and then make him appear
here and tell him again:

03:40:01.450 --> 03:40:06.450
Okay, so I'm going to go inside

03:40:07.202 --> 03:40:11.051
your mind and I need you to go
sit in the same exact place

03:40:11.052 --> 03:40:12.611
and I will be watching.

03:40:12.612 --> 03:40:14.595
Okay.
MATT: (meows)

03:40:15.507 --> 03:40:17.561
LIAM: If all goes well,

03:40:17.562 --> 03:40:20.191
there's going to be a bit of an eruption

03:40:20.192 --> 03:40:24.899
and when that happens, you're
going to go home for a bit.

03:40:24.900 --> 03:40:25.832
MATT: (meows)

03:40:25.832 --> 03:40:26.665
LIAM: Okay.

03:40:27.522 --> 03:40:29.468
Take this before you go.

03:40:29.469 --> 03:40:30.941
MATT: (purring)

03:40:30.942 --> 03:40:33.625
LIAM: All right. Thank you and I'm sorry.

03:40:35.643 --> 03:40:37.078
Okay. Off you go.

03:40:37.079 --> 03:40:38.204
MATT: (meows)

03:40:38.205 --> 03:40:39.761
He darts off and heads down the hall.

03:40:39.762 --> 03:40:43.113
LIAM: Place my hand on Veth's shoulder and

03:40:43.114 --> 03:40:45.979
I am blind and deaf

03:40:45.980 --> 03:40:47.491
and I am the cat.

03:40:47.492 --> 03:40:49.931
MATT: As you're looking through
the eyes of Frumpkin,

03:40:49.932 --> 03:40:53.171
you follow as he trucks
down past the entranceway

03:40:53.172 --> 03:40:55.361
to the tower, past the intersection

03:40:55.362 --> 03:40:58.431
and then once more to
the archway that leads

03:40:58.432 --> 03:41:01.011
into the entrance tunnel
where the traps have been set,

03:41:01.012 --> 03:41:02.517
but not within the radius.

03:41:02.518 --> 03:41:03.351
SAM: Yeah.
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

03:41:04.972 --> 03:41:07.601
I can't hear anything,
but I say: So, you know,

03:41:07.602 --> 03:41:10.031
don't let anything eat us or kill us.

03:41:10.032 --> 03:41:11.365
SAM: Sure, sure.
LIAM: Okay.

03:41:13.495 --> 03:41:15.661
SAM: Give him a little
squeeze on his arms.

03:41:15.662 --> 03:41:18.371
MATT: All right, and so are you setting up the dome?

03:41:18.372 --> 03:41:19.812
LIAM: I did that already.
MATT: Okay. Sorry, you did that already.

03:41:19.813 --> 03:41:21.011
LIAM: Yep.
MATT: So the dome is set up

03:41:21.012 --> 03:41:22.103
and you are just maintaining concentration.

03:41:22.104 --> 03:41:23.461
LIAM: Yeah.

03:41:23.462 --> 03:41:24.295
MATT: All right.

03:41:26.269 --> 03:41:27.145
And so you wait.

03:41:29.512 --> 03:41:32.751
You all are sleeping, except for you two?

03:41:32.752 --> 03:41:34.645
MARISHA: We'll trade off unless
anybody else needs to sleep?

03:41:34.646 --> 03:41:36.069
TRAVIS: Beau and I outside, listening.
ASHLEY: If you want to come

03:41:36.070 --> 03:41:37.421
get me at any point.

03:41:37.422 --> 03:41:38.921
MARISHA: Okay.

03:41:38.922 --> 03:41:39.755
ASHLEY: I'll try to get--

03:41:41.553 --> 03:41:44.241
I want to try to get some sleep
in because I'm pretty low.

03:41:44.242 --> 03:41:45.641
MARISHA: Get some sleep.

03:41:45.642 --> 03:41:48.281
ASHLEY: But wake me up,
when you're done.

03:41:48.282 --> 03:41:49.115
MARISHA: Okay.

03:41:49.116 --> 03:41:52.008
I give Yasha a little kiss and a little tap.

03:41:52.009 --> 03:41:53.141
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah.
MARISHA: (kiss noise)

03:41:53.142 --> 03:41:55.271
Get some rest.
ASHLEY: Give her a little slappies.

03:41:55.272 --> 03:41:58.381
Not a slappies, just
little tappies on the tush.

03:41:58.382 --> 03:42:00.589
MARISHA: Whatever you want.
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:42:00.590 --> 03:42:02.031
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:42:02.032 --> 03:42:03.351
MATT: All righty.

03:42:03.352 --> 03:42:05.017
LIAM: But aren't you sleeping?

03:42:05.018 --> 03:42:05.851
LAURA: I'm trying to.

03:42:05.852 --> 03:42:08.056
ASHLEY: Yeah, wake me up when you're tired.

MATT: As you all are napping,

03:42:15.695 --> 03:42:18.571
there's the far edge of the tower.

03:42:18.572 --> 03:42:21.571
Essek is, as opposed to
laying down and sleeping,

03:42:21.572 --> 03:42:26.572
is sitting in a
cross-legged, meditative way.

03:42:26.742 --> 03:42:29.741
Just gently floating about
a foot above the ground

03:42:29.742 --> 03:42:33.795
and in his reverie-type
sleep, is concentrating.

03:42:35.672 --> 03:42:37.589
MARISHA: I don't levitate when I meditate.

03:42:38.837 --> 03:42:40.492
I wonder if he could teach me that.

03:42:41.448 --> 03:42:42.785
MATT: You'll have to ask him later.

03:42:44.102 --> 03:42:46.125

03:42:56.152 --> 03:42:58.330

03:43:07.032 --> 03:43:08.609
The door is shut, right?

03:43:11.699 --> 03:43:13.601
ASHLEY: I thought it was open? |
LIAM: The door should be shut.

03:43:13.602 --> 03:43:14.435
TALIESIN: The door is shut, yeah.

03:43:14.436 --> 03:43:17.901
LIAM: Because I'm the one
opening it after the-- if it's not.

03:43:17.902 --> 03:43:20.922
MARISHA: Do you need to rest though,
can you rest while watching?

03:43:20.923 --> 03:43:22.451
LIAM: No, no.
LAURA: He doesn't get to rest.

03:43:22.452 --> 03:43:24.171
LIAM: I'm not going to be--
This is the gamble.

03:43:24.172 --> 03:43:26.271
I'm not going to be at full at all.

03:43:26.272 --> 03:43:27.814
LAURA: But everybody else
has to be in the tower.

03:43:27.815 --> 03:43:29.821
LIAM: In fact, I'm not
even at full hit points.

03:43:29.822 --> 03:43:31.831
MATT: Essek does get a
full rest because as an elf,

03:43:31.832 --> 03:43:35.036
he only needs four hours
for a full night's sleep.

03:43:35.037 --> 03:43:35.878
ASHLEY: That's so cool.

03:43:35.879 --> 03:43:37.201
LAURA: Seriously?

03:43:37.202 --> 03:43:38.819
MATT: Yeah.

03:43:38.820 --> 03:43:40.655

MARISHA: Oh, hmm.

03:43:48.785 --> 03:43:50.858
MATT: That's universally how elves are.

03:43:50.859 --> 03:43:54.024
(pretentiously) Mm, oh, mm.

03:43:54.025 --> 03:43:56.271
LIAM: So the door is shut?

03:43:56.272 --> 03:43:57.105
MARISHA: Sure, sure.

03:43:57.106 --> 03:43:58.571
LIAM: Okay, as you were.

03:43:58.572 --> 03:44:00.651
MATT: The rest of you are
in there, resting, sleeping.

03:44:00.652 --> 03:44:02.791
LAURA: Okay, so that's why
you were counting the hours.

03:44:02.792 --> 03:44:03.941
Because Essek got a full night's sleep

03:44:03.942 --> 03:44:05.776
and then we're going to
wake up at six hours

03:44:05.777 --> 03:44:07.415
and not get a full night's sleep.

03:44:11.872 --> 03:44:13.354
MATT: But at hour five--

03:44:13.355 --> 03:44:14.871

03:44:14.872 --> 03:44:15.946
Yeah.

03:44:15.947 --> 03:44:18.426
MATT: Essek, who's walking around,

03:44:18.427 --> 03:44:20.913
not even walking, drifting
through the tower,

03:44:23.402 --> 03:44:26.031
pulls the stone out and looks about

03:44:26.032 --> 03:44:28.432
the quiet space as the
rest of you are sleeping.

03:44:34.822 --> 03:44:36.081
All right, is anybody still up?

03:44:36.082 --> 03:44:37.203
Everyone else still sleeping?

03:44:37.204 --> 03:44:39.941
MARISHA: I imagine Fjord
and I probably fell asleep

03:44:39.942 --> 03:44:43.001
by the door and are
nodding off, in and out.

03:44:43.002 --> 03:44:44.455
MATT: Essek drifts over to you, Fjord.

03:44:47.120 --> 03:44:47.953
"Fjord,

to let them rest longer?"

TRAVIS: As long as we can.

03:46:07.582 --> 03:46:09.771
MATT: Did Caleb set his alarm?

03:46:09.772 --> 03:46:10.871
MARISHA: Uh-uh.
LIAM: No.

03:46:10.872 --> 03:46:12.408
I'd have to go
to sleep and wake up

03:46:12.409 --> 03:46:15.651
and we gave up on me resting,
so there's no alarm.

03:46:15.652 --> 03:46:19.541
It's just my cat looking
for a Tetsuo explosion.

03:46:19.542 --> 03:46:21.031
MARISHA: Should we open the door?

03:46:30.332 --> 03:46:32.121
and close to where you are resting

03:46:32.122 --> 03:46:33.421
and where you were setting up there

03:46:33.422 --> 03:46:35.205
and just crosses his arms.

you and Essek remain conscious,

03:47:05.615 --> 03:47:09.698
just locked in eye contact, waiting,

03:47:10.665 --> 03:47:13.108
occasionally looking out
over the rest of the troupe.

03:47:21.945 --> 03:47:26.945
You're now well into your
fifth hour of Frumpkin,

03:47:27.123 --> 03:47:30.794
concentrating, and you're tired.

03:47:30.795 --> 03:47:33.734
It's a lot of monotonous staring

03:47:33.735 --> 03:47:38.398
into a still, dark room
with no light source

03:47:38.399 --> 03:47:42.042
with a cat that cannot really
see well in this space.

03:47:42.985 --> 03:47:45.974
I would like you to make a
constitution saving throw for me.

03:47:45.975 --> 03:47:47.365
LIAM: Constitution saving throw, and

03:47:48.664 --> 03:47:50.030
I'm not roll-- I'm about to do that.

03:47:50.031 --> 03:47:51.994
I'm not relying on Frumpkin, really,

03:47:51.995 --> 03:47:53.943
to see or hear well.

03:47:55.062 --> 03:47:56.664
If my vision goes (swishing),

03:47:56.665 --> 03:47:57.984

MATT: Yes, I agree.

03:47:58.819 --> 03:48:00.504

MARISHA: Shit.
MATT: 10, okay.

03:48:09.462 --> 03:48:13.784
In the long time, in the
stillness, in the quiet,

03:48:13.785 --> 03:48:17.818
you're trying to resist nodding off,

03:48:18.935 --> 03:48:19.822
and you do so.

03:48:19.823 --> 03:48:21.504
SAM: (sigh of relief)

03:48:21.505 --> 03:48:22.528
MATT: 10 was the DC.

03:48:27.276 --> 03:48:29.826
(whoosh) There's a flash above.

03:48:31.888 --> 03:48:34.283
SAM: She doesn't see me fall asleep?

03:48:34.284 --> 03:48:35.839
MARISHA: No, he said you didn't.
SAM: You didn't fall asleep.

03:48:35.840 --> 03:48:37.514
MARISHA: You saved.
MATT: No, you didn't, you saved.

03:48:37.515 --> 03:48:39.798
10 was the DC, you succeeded.

03:48:40.905 --> 03:48:43.848
Frumpkin suddenly glances up.

03:48:47.304 --> 03:48:48.137
(thud)

03:48:49.635 --> 03:48:53.882
You see three little lights (whooshing).

03:48:53.883 --> 03:48:55.256
And then you lose
connection with Frumpkin.

03:48:55.257 --> 03:48:56.944
SAM: (gasps)

03:48:56.945 --> 03:48:58.564
LIAM: It's happening.

03:48:58.565 --> 03:49:01.237
MATT: Now let me make some
rolls here on my own.

03:49:01.238 --> 03:49:03.774
SAM: Oh, oh, oh!

03:49:03.775 --> 03:49:04.864
LIAM: We're frozen in time,

03:49:04.865 --> 03:49:07.852
but that means that you
guys are getting shat out

03:49:07.853 --> 03:49:09.594
the side of a stone wall.

03:49:09.595 --> 03:49:10.428
MARISHA: Huh?

03:49:10.429 --> 03:49:11.815
SAM and TALIESIN: We got a short rest.

03:49:11.816 --> 03:49:12.790
SAM: Yeah.
MATT: Got a short rest.

03:49:12.791 --> 03:49:14.097
MARISHA: Well.
MATT: Not a full rest.

03:49:14.098 --> 03:49:15.305
MARISHA: Got a short rest.
TALIESIN: Take my short rest.

03:49:15.306 --> 03:49:16.813
MATT: I rolled to see
how close they were,

03:49:16.814 --> 03:49:19.634
and they were a lot closer, sorry.

03:49:19.635 --> 03:49:21.024
ASHLEY: I have a question.

03:49:21.025 --> 03:49:24.044
So if we've already done one short rest,

03:49:24.045 --> 03:49:25.728
and I used all my hit dice--

03:49:25.729 --> 03:49:26.736
LIAM: You can't use them again.

03:49:26.737 --> 03:49:27.845
ASHLEY: You can't reuse them, right?

03:49:27.846 --> 03:49:29.217
MATT: Correct.
ASHLEY: If we do another short rest? Okay.

03:49:29.218 --> 03:49:30.944
MATT: Until you can take a long rest, yeah.

03:49:30.945 --> 03:49:31.778
ASHLEY: Cool.

03:49:31.779 --> 03:49:35.271
MATT: Now, DC is 18?

03:49:36.245 --> 03:49:37.078
LAURA: On?

03:49:37.079 --> 03:49:39.123
MATT: On your Symbol.

03:49:41.435 --> 03:49:42.827
LAURA: Yeah, 18.

03:49:42.828 --> 03:49:43.870
MATT: Okay.

03:49:56.985 --> 03:49:58.517
LAURA: Does a Heroes' Feast
bring you back up to

03:49:58.518 --> 03:49:59.884
full hit points?

03:50:01.615 --> 03:50:03.337
I don't think it does.

03:50:03.338 --> 03:50:04.994
MATT: I don't believe so.

03:50:04.995 --> 03:50:06.934
TALIESIN: But you gain the hit points

03:50:06.935 --> 03:50:08.861
that the temporary hit, so you gain two.

03:50:08.862 --> 03:50:10.034
LAURA: Two hit points.

03:50:10.035 --> 03:50:10.868
SAM: Yeah, we're fine now.

03:50:10.869 --> 03:50:12.593
LIAM: We got this.
LAURA: Yep.

03:50:13.747 --> 03:50:15.565
ASHLEY: It's as if I had
a full night's rest.

03:50:16.865 --> 03:50:18.464
MATT: See, now, those--

03:50:18.465 --> 03:50:19.298
Sorry, I'm going to do

03:50:19.299 --> 03:50:21.734
some interesting
behind-the-scenes rolls here.

03:50:21.735 --> 03:50:24.224
Be patient, I apologize.

03:50:24.225 --> 03:50:25.058
SAM: It's on.

03:50:25.059 --> 03:50:26.514
LIAM: Let's play 'til 4:00am.
TALIESIN: I hate all of this.

03:50:26.515 --> 03:50:28.057
SAM: It's on!

ASHLEY: I woke up now, I'm ready.

03:50:32.565 --> 03:50:35.314
MATT: (laughs)

03:50:35.315 --> 03:50:36.914
SAM: Are you laughing at your rolls?

03:50:36.915 --> 03:50:38.234
ASHLEY: Is it a good laugh,
or is it a bad laugh?

03:50:38.235 --> 03:50:39.284
MATT: You'll find out.

03:50:39.285 --> 03:50:40.622
SAM: He's mad cackling.

03:50:40.623 --> 03:50:41.712
MATT: (laughs)

03:50:41.713 --> 03:50:43.624
This shit got really interesting.

03:50:43.625 --> 03:50:44.458
Okay.

03:50:47.655 --> 03:50:49.390
LIAM: The bones tell me nothing.

03:50:50.294 --> 03:50:52.024
MARISHA: (laughs)

03:50:52.025 --> 03:50:54.210
SAM: As long as Otis is
dead, doesn't matter.

03:50:54.211 --> 03:50:55.744
LIAM: (laughs)

03:50:55.745 --> 03:50:57.764
MARISHA: He's the real big bad.

03:50:57.765 --> 03:51:00.355
LAURA: The intuit charges
do how much damage?

03:51:00.356 --> 03:51:01.716
TRAVIS and LIAM: 10d10.

03:51:01.717 --> 03:51:03.167
LAURA: That's great.
ASHLEY: 10d10?!

03:51:03.168 --> 03:51:06.458
LIAM: So that's 30d10
that just happened.

03:51:11.015 --> 03:51:11.995
SAM: Of psychic.

03:51:11.995 --> 03:51:12.945
LIAM: Psychic.

03:51:12.946 --> 03:51:14.924
SAM: So we hope that works.

03:51:14.925 --> 03:51:17.198
LIAM: That does nothing to Lucien.

03:51:17.199 --> 03:51:18.032
SAM: Yeah.

03:51:18.033 --> 03:51:19.810
MARISHA: (exhales)

03:51:19.811 --> 03:51:21.898
TALIESIN: Just trying
to thin out his posse.

03:51:23.095 --> 03:51:25.827
LIAM: That's an average of
150 hit points of damage

03:51:25.828 --> 03:51:27.804
to anyone who is not
invulnerable to psychic damage.

03:51:27.805 --> 03:51:28.934
SAM: Even if they're--

03:51:28.935 --> 03:51:31.344
TALIESIN: And that's not
counting if they fall.

03:51:31.345 --> 03:51:33.771
LAURA: Yeah, so they could
take fall damage, too.

03:51:33.772 --> 03:51:34.994
SAM: But if they're resistant to it,

03:51:34.995 --> 03:51:37.874
that's still 25 points.
MATT: So

03:51:37.875 --> 03:51:41.582
if I could have Beauregard and Caleb

03:51:41.583 --> 03:51:44.464
roll 10d10 for me.

03:51:44.465 --> 03:51:45.298
LAURA: Oh!

03:51:45.299 --> 03:51:46.380
MARISHA: We're rolling?
MATT: For each of the

03:51:46.381 --> 03:51:48.744
intuit charges that you set.

03:51:48.745 --> 03:51:51.609
MARISHA: Okay, 10d10,
okay. Okay, okay, okay.

03:51:51.610 --> 03:51:52.860
SAM: Those are all d6s.

03:51:56.002 --> 03:51:58.344
Those are all d6s.

03:51:58.345 --> 03:52:00.510
LIAM: Oh, thank you. I'm just terrified.

03:52:00.511 --> 03:52:02.003
MATT: (laughs)
LIAM: I'm just terrified.

03:52:03.545 --> 03:52:04.535
TALIESIN: Throw you one, I mean.

03:52:04.536 --> 03:52:05.914
LIAM: I've got plenty.

03:52:05.915 --> 03:52:06.931
MARISHA: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

03:52:06.932 --> 03:52:08.264
Where'd my--?

03:52:08.265 --> 03:52:10.424
LAURA: This is why you have
giant hoards like I do.

03:52:10.425 --> 03:52:11.876
TALIESIN: Underneath that weird--

03:52:11.877 --> 03:52:12.792
SAM: I have one d10.

03:52:12.792 --> 03:52:13.625
MARISHA: Is this a d10?

03:52:13.626 --> 03:52:14.704
No, good, good, good,

03:52:14.705 --> 03:52:16.024
just what I needed, five.

03:52:16.025 --> 03:52:18.374
LAURA: Obviously, my giant
hoards do nothing, though,

03:52:18.375 --> 03:52:21.850
for my quality rolls.
MARISHA: Oh, okay, okay, okay.

03:52:23.025 --> 03:52:24.914
Hang on, hang on.

03:52:24.915 --> 03:52:25.748
That would be 20.

03:52:25.749 --> 03:52:26.974
SAM: I've been using
the same set of dice

03:52:26.975 --> 03:52:29.254
for three years.

03:52:29.255 --> 03:52:32.054
LAURA: Maybe campaign 3, I'll
just have one set of dice.

03:52:32.055 --> 03:52:33.794
SAM: That's not true.

03:52:33.795 --> 03:52:35.176
TALIESIN: You're a liar.

03:52:36.125 --> 03:52:37.164
ASHLEY: That'd be hard.

03:52:37.165 --> 03:52:39.214
TALIESIN: You might start over fresh, maybe.

03:52:39.215 --> 03:52:41.784
LAURA: Maybe, yeah, like, I'll have new.

03:52:41.785 --> 03:52:43.237
LIAM: 55 for me.

03:52:43.238 --> 03:52:44.238
SAM: Ooh, nice.

03:52:46.091 --> 03:52:48.853
MARISHA: Another (exhales)

03:52:48.854 --> 03:52:53.845
20, five, plus-- shoot, okay.

03:52:55.125 --> 03:52:56.573
Not too bad for me.

03:52:58.335 --> 03:52:59.168
66.

03:52:59.169 --> 03:53:00.774
SAM: Whoa.
LIAM: High, that's high.

03:53:00.775 --> 03:53:01.968
MATT: That's really high.

03:53:02.887 --> 03:53:06.412
MARISHA: I rolled three 10s, yeah.

03:53:06.413 --> 03:53:07.621
LIAM: (exhales)

03:53:11.863 --> 03:53:12.696
MARISHA: (exhales)

03:53:13.629 --> 03:53:14.563
(laughing sigh)

03:53:17.765 --> 03:53:22.324
MATT: So you lost
connection to Frumpkin.

03:53:22.325 --> 03:53:23.185
What happens now?

03:53:23.185 --> 03:53:24.060
LIAM: I count.

03:53:24.061 --> 03:53:28.875
<i>Eins, zwei, drei, vier, fünf.</i>

03:53:28.876 --> 03:53:31.171
And I release the tower.

03:53:32.664 --> 03:53:34.114
MATT: (whooshing)

03:53:34.115 --> 03:53:36.144
All of you who are still unconscious

03:53:36.145 --> 03:53:39.824
are knocked out of your deep sleep

03:53:39.825 --> 03:53:42.094
into the somewhat cold interior,

03:53:42.095 --> 03:53:45.774
the non-comfortable
center of this tunnel.

03:53:45.775 --> 03:53:47.154
For a moment, you're discombobulated

03:53:47.155 --> 03:53:51.448
as you begin to realize
where you are and why.

03:53:52.965 --> 03:53:54.904
Essek and Fjord are both conscious.

03:53:54.905 --> 03:53:56.128
Essek looks over at you.

03:53:57.405 --> 03:53:58.490
"It's go time."

03:54:01.765 --> 03:54:04.494
LAURA: Did the intuit
charges already go off?

03:54:04.495 --> 03:54:05.724
LIAM: Yep, rolled for them all.

03:54:05.725 --> 03:54:06.558
MATT: You assume.

03:54:06.559 --> 03:54:07.988
TRAVIS: It was earlier than we wanted.

03:54:08.875 --> 03:54:09.708
Now's the time.

03:54:11.155 --> 03:54:12.135
LAURA: What do we see?

03:54:12.136 --> 03:54:13.688
What do we see?

03:54:13.689 --> 03:54:15.144
MATT: You don't see anything right now.

03:54:15.145 --> 03:54:17.483
There is no light down the tunnel.

03:54:20.071 --> 03:54:21.934
SAM: I'm going to--

03:54:21.935 --> 03:54:22.984
MATT: Do you want to
make a perception check?

03:54:22.985 --> 03:54:24.725
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

03:54:24.726 --> 03:54:28.794
SAM: I'm going to cast a spell
on Caleb, Intellect Fortress,

03:54:28.795 --> 03:54:31.124
and I'm going to start
running full speed, dash.

03:54:31.125 --> 03:54:33.344
MATT: Okay, I need you to
make an acrobatics check

03:54:33.345 --> 03:54:35.354
as you are now running
down part of a decline

03:54:35.355 --> 03:54:37.354
covered in ice and frost.

03:54:37.355 --> 03:54:38.644
TRAVIS: 19 for perception.

03:54:38.645 --> 03:54:40.464
SAM: Acrobatics, you said?

03:54:40.465 --> 03:54:42.524
Oh, 20.

03:54:42.525 --> 03:54:45.144
MATT: Yeah, you're more
sliding down at this point.

03:54:45.145 --> 03:54:47.924
SAM: Also, that spell
is a 3rd-level spell.

03:54:47.925 --> 03:54:50.304
MATT: Indeed, so roll
another d20 for me.

03:54:50.305 --> 03:54:51.145
SAM: 12.

03:54:51.146 --> 03:54:53.145
MATT: Okay, you're fine.
SAM: Okay.

03:54:56.765 --> 03:54:58.804
LIAM: I'm not-- I'm just using the rope

03:54:58.805 --> 03:55:01.144
to try to go down,

03:55:01.145 --> 03:55:03.504
but I'm not running, or
bolting, or anything.

03:55:03.505 --> 03:55:06.293
MATT: No worries, no worries at all.

03:55:06.294 --> 03:55:07.630
All right.

03:55:07.631 --> 03:55:09.220
MARISHA: Fjord rolled perception.

03:55:10.425 --> 03:55:11.361
MATT: What'd you get? You said 19?

03:55:11.361 --> 03:55:12.194
TRAVIS: 19.

03:55:12.195 --> 03:55:13.692
MATT: Anybody else? One
other person can roll,

03:55:13.693 --> 03:55:15.059
or can give him advantage.

03:55:15.060 --> 03:55:16.384
TALIESIN: I'll give you advantage.

03:55:16.385 --> 03:55:17.255
TRAVIS: Are you sure?

03:55:17.256 --> 03:55:20.094
TALIESIN: Yeah, I can't see.
I don't have darkvision.

03:55:20.095 --> 03:55:21.681
TRAVIS: Oh, 21.

03:55:23.525 --> 03:55:25.004
18, natural 18.

03:55:25.005 --> 03:55:25.838
MATT: Nice.

03:55:28.475 --> 03:55:32.058
So you don't see anything,

03:55:33.225 --> 03:55:35.481
but what you hear is a voice going,

03:55:37.022 --> 03:55:40.634
"Fuck. <i>Fuck</i>."

03:55:40.635 --> 03:55:41.600
SAM: Ooh.

03:55:41.601 --> 03:55:43.394
TRAVIS: We recognize the voice?

03:55:43.395 --> 03:55:44.824
MATT: Sounds very much like Lucien.

03:55:44.825 --> 03:55:46.151
SAM: Yeah.

03:55:46.152 --> 03:55:47.478
TRAVIS: Lucien's down here?

03:55:48.315 --> 03:55:49.434
MATT: You don't know where it came from.

03:55:49.435 --> 03:55:51.512
It's echo-y and in the distance.

03:55:54.058 --> 03:55:55.322
What do you do?

03:55:56.592 --> 03:55:58.184
You all waiting for them to come to you?

03:55:58.185 --> 03:55:59.814
LAURA: No, let's give them shit.
MATT: No.

03:55:59.815 --> 03:56:00.795
MARISHA: It's go time, right?

03:56:00.796 --> 03:56:01.948
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: Go time?

03:56:01.949 --> 03:56:02.936
SAM: What about the thing?
LIAM: Gotta light it up.

03:56:02.937 --> 03:56:04.574
LAURA: Send the blasts down into the--

03:56:04.575 --> 03:56:05.505
LIAM: We never decided

03:56:05.505 --> 03:56:06.505
to give those--
SAM: ARG, what is it?

03:56:06.506 --> 03:56:08.104
LIAM: We never decided to
give those to anybody else.

03:56:08.105 --> 03:56:11.134
MARISHA: Oh, we got-- well, we talked

03:56:11.135 --> 03:56:13.274
about how you were
going to teach us that,

03:56:13.275 --> 03:56:14.524
which I assume we did.
LIAM: And we never did it.

03:56:14.525 --> 03:56:15.861
LAURA: We know we said we were
going to do it over Heroes'--

03:56:15.862 --> 03:56:17.528
MARISHA: Over Heroes' Feast, yeah.

03:56:17.529 --> 03:56:19.844
LAURA: But we didn't say it
out loud while we were--

03:56:19.845 --> 03:56:22.445
LIAM: We said it ahead of
time, we didn't say it during.

03:56:23.545 --> 03:56:27.844
MATT: Well, as you all
begin to make your way,

03:56:27.845 --> 03:56:32.444
and it is a bit of a
quick run to the edge,

03:56:32.445 --> 03:56:34.384
glancing over inside
the chamber, there--

03:56:34.385 --> 03:56:36.784
does anyone want to have a light source

03:56:36.785 --> 03:56:39.163
for those who cannot see in the dark?

03:56:39.164 --> 03:56:41.054
LAURA: We've got 60 feet darkvision.

03:56:41.055 --> 03:56:42.364
TRAVIS: 60 feet as well,

03:56:42.365 --> 03:56:43.546
which is to the middle of the room.

03:56:43.547 --> 03:56:45.154
LAURA: Yeah, that's to
the middle of the room.

03:56:45.155 --> 03:56:46.616
MATT: Who does not have darkvision?

03:56:46.617 --> 03:56:48.794
MARISHA: I've got my goggles.

03:56:48.795 --> 03:56:50.010
MATT: All right. That's half the group

03:56:50.011 --> 03:56:51.158
who can't see right now.

03:56:51.159 --> 03:56:54.063
LIAM: Matt, I don't know how
fast things are moving here.

03:56:54.064 --> 03:56:56.314
Have Veth and Caleb
come anywhere near the group

03:56:56.315 --> 03:56:57.974
in the way this is timing out?

03:56:57.975 --> 03:56:59.744
Or is it like slow motion?

03:56:59.745 --> 03:57:00.685
MATT: You've got a little ways to go.

03:57:00.686 --> 03:57:03.644
Like-- also, to be fair,

03:57:03.645 --> 03:57:05.574
the rest of the group is pretty quick,

03:57:05.575 --> 03:57:06.934
at least half of it,

03:57:06.935 --> 03:57:08.684
but you're moving in tandem,

03:57:08.685 --> 03:57:10.031
so you're about 100 feet
behind the rest of the group.

03:57:10.032 --> 03:57:12.244
LIAM: Well, we would fall down
in this hallway, running,

03:57:12.245 --> 03:57:15.020
so I'm going to bring up
globules of light while we move

03:57:15.021 --> 03:57:15.854
so that we don't.
MATT: Okay.

03:57:15.855 --> 03:57:17.657
So the both of you
running with the light?

03:57:17.658 --> 03:57:19.914
MARISHA: How long does it last?
LAURA: Is your sword out?

03:57:19.915 --> 03:57:20.748
TRAVIS: Not yet.

03:57:20.748 --> 03:57:21.581
MARISHA: That's a good question.

03:57:23.125 --> 03:57:24.154
Was about to say, 'til it's done,

03:57:24.155 --> 03:57:25.404
but I don't know if that's true.

03:57:25.405 --> 03:57:26.238
LAURA: If they're stunned,

03:57:26.239 --> 03:57:28.414
if they're in pain,
it only lasts for a minute.

03:57:28.415 --> 03:57:29.248
MARISHA: Let's go.

03:57:29.249 --> 03:57:30.547
LAURA: I fucking go in there.
MARISHA: I move.

03:57:30.548 --> 03:57:32.130
LIAM: Yeah.
MARISHA: As soon as Beau's ass

03:57:32.131 --> 03:57:33.304
hits the ground.
TALIESIN: An hour.

03:57:33.305 --> 03:57:34.806
MARISHA: Oh, then let's do it.

03:57:34.807 --> 03:57:35.695
TRAVIS: If I get to the doorway

03:57:35.696 --> 03:57:37.814
and I have 60-feet darkvision,

03:57:37.815 --> 03:57:40.727
if I can see him,
or even a semblance of--

03:57:40.728 --> 03:57:42.014
MATT: So Fjord, you get
to the doorway there.

03:57:42.015 --> 03:57:43.814
MARISHA: I give off light, okay.

03:57:43.815 --> 03:57:45.598
MATT: Here's what you see.
TALIESIN: Yeah, you give off...

03:57:47.073 --> 03:57:48.574
30 feet.

03:57:48.575 --> 03:57:50.634
MARISHA: Beau has Holy Weapon on her.

03:57:50.635 --> 03:57:51.468
LAURA: Okay.

03:57:51.469 --> 03:57:53.576
TALIESIN: So we have 30 feet of light.
ASHLEY: Yes.

03:57:55.381 --> 03:57:57.964
(gasping)

03:58:01.115 --> 03:58:01.948
MARISHA: Who dat?

03:58:01.949 --> 03:58:03.189
ASHLEY: Who are they?

03:58:03.190 --> 03:58:04.289
Who's standing?
LIAM: Oh, it's Lucien.

03:58:04.290 --> 03:58:05.123
LAURA: Two of them are standing,

03:58:05.124 --> 03:58:06.313
and three of them have fallen.

03:58:06.314 --> 03:58:07.574
MATT: Beauregard gets there quickly

03:58:07.575 --> 03:58:08.485
because she's pretty fast.

03:58:08.486 --> 03:58:10.485
She gets to it before anybody else does.

03:58:12.705 --> 03:58:15.344
Everyone else gets up into the space.

03:58:15.345 --> 03:58:16.674
TALIESIN: I'm in the back.

03:58:16.675 --> 03:58:17.525
MATT: Right.

03:58:17.526 --> 03:58:19.004
TALIESIN: Because I have
a concentration spell up.

03:58:19.005 --> 03:58:20.068
LAURA: Can I see?

03:58:23.075 --> 03:58:25.614
ASHLEY: I have my sword out also.

03:58:25.615 --> 03:58:27.280
MATT: Okay.
ASHLEY: Yep.

03:58:27.281 --> 03:58:28.364
MATT: But you have darkvision, right?

03:58:28.365 --> 03:58:29.313
ASHLEY: Yes.

03:58:29.314 --> 03:58:31.024
MATT: Right, Essek is
a little bit behind.

03:58:31.025 --> 03:58:33.398
He's not as quick either.

03:58:34.425 --> 03:58:35.951
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm not in the room yet.

03:58:35.952 --> 03:58:38.844
LAURA: And we would spread out
as fast as possible.

03:58:38.845 --> 03:58:40.574
MATT: Do you spread out
as fast as possible?

03:58:40.575 --> 03:58:42.584
TRAVIS: I would send Eldritch Blast

03:58:42.585 --> 03:58:44.113
towards anyone just to kick off

03:58:44.114 --> 03:58:45.705
initiative as soon as they hit.
LAURA: I would send Guiding Bolt

03:58:45.706 --> 03:58:48.555
towards anyone in the center of the room.
TRAVIS: To max out this minute.

03:58:48.556 --> 03:58:50.174
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's time
to light shit up.

03:58:50.175 --> 03:58:53.044
MARISHA: I smash my fists together,

03:58:53.045 --> 03:58:56.445
and light up my lightning gloves.

03:58:57.515 --> 03:59:00.734
MATT: Okay, well, for
those who are currently

03:59:00.735 --> 03:59:02.571
in the combat right now.

03:59:02.572 --> 03:59:03.405
MARISHA: Ho.

03:59:03.406 --> 03:59:04.574
MATT: Let's go ahead
and roll initiative.

03:59:04.575 --> 03:59:06.294
TRAVIS: Are we fighting tonight?

03:59:06.295 --> 03:59:07.718
MATT: No.
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:59:07.719 --> 03:59:08.984
MATT: But we're going to do something

03:59:08.985 --> 03:59:10.434
that's going to set the stage here.

03:59:10.435 --> 03:59:11.614
LAURA: Okay.

03:59:11.615 --> 03:59:15.272
MATT: This first round
will set the stage, so.

03:59:15.273 --> 03:59:16.938
SAM: (cackles)
MARISHA: Initiative?

03:59:16.939 --> 03:59:18.583
MATT: Correct.

03:59:18.584 --> 03:59:21.557
MARISHA: Mm. Mm-mm-mm, okay, okay.

03:59:21.558 --> 03:59:22.867
LAURA: Oh my god.

03:59:22.868 --> 03:59:24.375
TRAVIS: All right, that's
the best initiative

03:59:24.376 --> 03:59:25.559
I've had in months.

03:59:27.239 --> 03:59:30.156
MARISHA: (whispered counting)

03:59:31.135 --> 03:59:32.594
Yeah, yeah, I'm going to stick.

03:59:32.595 --> 03:59:34.088
LAURA: Oh, cool angle.

03:59:35.759 --> 03:59:37.382
ASHLEY: Ooh!

03:59:37.383 --> 03:59:39.644
SAM: (vocalizing)
MATT: All right.

03:59:39.645 --> 03:59:41.944
Those who rolled, 25 to 20?

03:59:41.945 --> 03:59:42.805
LAURA: 22.

03:59:42.806 --> 03:59:43.947
MARISHA: 23.

03:59:43.948 --> 03:59:45.867
MATT: All right, see what we got.

03:59:45.868 --> 03:59:47.127
TRAVIS: Beau and Jess.

03:59:47.128 --> 03:59:48.123
MARISHA: Beau, Jess.

03:59:48.124 --> 03:59:49.510
SAM: Beaujest.

03:59:56.632 --> 03:59:57.775
MATT: 20 to 15?

03:59:57.776 --> 03:59:58.658
TRAVIS: 18.
TALIESIN: 15.

03:59:58.659 --> 03:59:59.951
ASHLEY: 15 for me as well.

03:59:59.952 --> 04:00:00.785
SAM: Whoa.

04:00:02.790 --> 04:00:05.374
LAURA: Fjord, Caduceus.
MARISHA: Ford, Cad, Yasha?

04:00:05.375 --> 04:00:06.494
Or Yasha--?

04:00:06.495 --> 04:00:07.695
LAURA: What's your dexterity?

04:00:08.875 --> 04:00:11.254
TALIESIN: My dex is 14.

04:00:11.255 --> 04:00:12.447
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll go before you.

04:00:12.448 --> 04:00:13.512
TALIESIN: Okay.

04:00:13.513 --> 04:00:15.344
MARISHA: Fjord, Yasha, Cad?

04:00:15.345 --> 04:00:17.814
TRAVIS: Fjord, Yasha, Caduceus.

04:00:17.815 --> 04:00:19.294
MATT: Okay, and then
the rest of the group

04:00:19.295 --> 04:00:20.514
is catching up currently.

04:00:20.515 --> 04:00:21.505
SAM: Mm-hmm.

04:00:21.506 --> 04:00:22.964
MATT: All right, so as
you guys are running,

04:00:22.965 --> 04:00:24.824
and then, actually--

04:00:24.825 --> 04:00:27.848
Aw, shit, Essek rolled really bad.

04:00:29.360 --> 04:00:30.883
Okay.

04:00:30.884 --> 04:00:31.964
MARISHA: Essek is in there?

04:00:31.965 --> 04:00:33.584
MATT: He's in there,
but his initiative--

04:00:33.585 --> 04:00:34.418
MARISHA: Somewhere?

04:00:34.419 --> 04:00:36.054
MATT: He's behind you with Caduceus.

04:00:36.055 --> 04:00:36.888
MARISHA: Okay.

04:00:38.205 --> 04:00:39.038
MATT: So, top of the round,

04:00:39.039 --> 04:00:40.574
as you get into the space,

04:00:40.575 --> 04:00:41.925
those who can see

04:00:42.817 --> 04:00:44.907
see

04:00:44.908 --> 04:00:46.867
Tyffial,

04:00:46.868 --> 04:00:48.126
Otis,

04:00:49.905 --> 04:00:54.896
and Zoran face down on the ground,

04:00:56.055 --> 04:00:56.945
not moving.

04:00:56.946 --> 04:00:59.311
SAM: Yeah!

04:01:01.715 --> 04:01:05.098
MATT: You see, just having
descended from the rope,

04:01:06.445 --> 04:01:11.164
Cree, who, while very bloodied,

04:01:11.165 --> 04:01:13.584
seems to be partially recovered,

04:01:13.585 --> 04:01:14.668
shaking it out,

04:01:15.885 --> 04:01:19.204
and an untouched Lucien,

04:01:19.205 --> 04:01:21.824
who are both in the process

04:01:21.825 --> 04:01:26.224
of frustratingly looking
at the space around them,

04:01:26.225 --> 04:01:29.164
and grabbing two large sacks,

04:01:29.165 --> 04:01:33.274
like large backpacks,
holding them to themselves

04:01:33.275 --> 04:01:34.804
before they look up,

04:01:34.805 --> 04:01:35.755
and as you guys rush in,

04:01:35.756 --> 04:01:37.812
Lucien goes,

04:01:37.813 --> 04:01:42.121
"Well, that's a real
dickish thing to do!"

04:01:44.325 --> 04:01:46.174
First up is Beauregard.

04:01:46.175 --> 04:01:47.008
What do you do?

04:01:47.009 --> 04:01:49.184
MARISHA: (exhales) Okay, I'm
going to reach in my pocket,

04:01:49.185 --> 04:01:51.524
I'm going to pull out that
Arcane Field Generator,

04:01:51.525 --> 04:01:53.474
and I'm going to (heavy clicking),

04:01:53.475 --> 04:01:57.374
and give it a little kiss,
and toss it in.

04:01:57.375 --> 04:01:58.568
MATT: Okay.

04:01:58.569 --> 04:02:01.294
(whooshing) As you throw it, you can see

04:02:01.295 --> 04:02:03.314
Lucien, who's holding the pack,

04:02:03.315 --> 04:02:05.084
backs to defend himself

04:02:05.085 --> 04:02:08.084
from whatever it is,
and as you throw it,

04:02:08.085 --> 04:02:11.484
this wave of electrifying arcane energy

04:02:11.485 --> 04:02:13.674
fills the chamber around them,

04:02:13.675 --> 04:02:17.064
and sets in place these little drift,

04:02:17.065 --> 04:02:18.834
soft spheres of light,

04:02:18.835 --> 04:02:21.944
like someone blew a dandelion,

04:02:21.945 --> 04:02:24.204
and all the pieces just held in place,

04:02:24.205 --> 04:02:26.964
slightly gyrating with this faint glow,

04:02:26.965 --> 04:02:29.615
and it fills the area except for--

04:02:32.685 --> 04:02:35.304
SAM: (buzzing)
MATT: -- right here.

04:02:35.305 --> 04:02:38.124
MARISHA: Great, great, great, great, great.

04:02:38.125 --> 04:02:41.524
Okay, I can still move, yeah?

04:02:41.525 --> 04:02:43.494
MATT: You can still move, yeah.

04:02:43.495 --> 04:02:44.904
MARISHA: Where's Lucien?

04:02:44.905 --> 04:02:45.994
MATT: Right there.
MARISHA: He's with those--

04:02:45.995 --> 04:02:47.273
Dead center?

04:02:47.274 --> 04:02:50.092
Oh, yeah, yeah.
SAM: Where my fluffernutter would've been.

04:02:50.093 --> 04:02:51.176
MARISHA: Whew, okay.

04:02:53.445 --> 04:02:55.474
This wall's fairly scalable for, like,

04:02:55.475 --> 04:02:57.664
a monk that can run up walls, yeah?

04:02:57.665 --> 04:02:58.568
MATT: Meaning this here?

04:02:58.569 --> 04:03:00.044
MARISHA: Yeah, this piece of rubble,

04:03:00.045 --> 04:03:00.878
rubble, rubble, yeah.

04:03:00.878 --> 04:03:01.765
SAM: Asking for a friend.

04:03:01.765 --> 04:03:02.598
MATT: Yeah, give it a shot.

04:03:02.599 --> 04:03:04.264
I mean, it's a wall
that's mostly fallen,

04:03:04.265 --> 04:03:06.374
and broken, and who knows

04:03:06.375 --> 04:03:09.164
if it can hold something.

04:03:09.165 --> 04:03:11.174
MARISHA: Yeah, but I can wall climb.

04:03:11.175 --> 04:03:14.284
I am going to haul ass,

04:03:14.285 --> 04:03:16.634
and start doing exactly
what we talked about,

04:03:16.635 --> 04:03:17.984
and I'm going to start spreading out,

04:03:17.985 --> 04:03:20.524
and I know I have a
better shot of making it

04:03:20.525 --> 04:03:22.454
to this side than probably
some of my teammates,

04:03:22.455 --> 04:03:23.288
so I want to try--

04:03:23.288 --> 04:03:24.121
MATT: Try and run up the wall,

04:03:24.122 --> 04:03:26.011
and jump over here, you mean?

04:03:26.012 --> 04:03:26.845
Or over where?

04:03:26.846 --> 04:03:29.664
MARISHA: Yep, yeah, yeah,
can I find that, like,

04:03:29.665 --> 04:03:31.325
a pocket--

04:03:32.195 --> 04:03:34.084
My laser's not great.

04:03:34.085 --> 04:03:35.614
Yeah, around that way.

04:03:35.615 --> 04:03:37.118
MATT: Yeah, and then where
do you want to land?

04:03:38.835 --> 04:03:39.832
On top of the wall you want to land?

04:03:39.832 --> 04:03:40.725
MARISHA: No, no, no,

04:03:40.726 --> 04:03:42.290
but, like, in a pocket

04:03:42.291 --> 04:03:43.848
on the other side of the wall.
MATT: On the side over here, you mean?

04:03:43.849 --> 04:03:44.682
MARISHA: Yes.

04:03:44.682 --> 04:03:45.573
MATT: Okay.

04:03:45.574 --> 04:03:47.149
MARISHA: 55 feet of movement.

04:03:47.150 --> 04:03:47.983
SAM: Fitty-five.

04:03:47.983 --> 04:03:48.925
MARISHA: Fitty-five.
MATT: You can wall climb.

04:03:48.926 --> 04:03:50.211
You just run up, tch, tch, tch,

04:03:50.212 --> 04:03:51.754
and you jump down behind?

04:03:51.755 --> 04:03:55.004
MARISHA: Yep, was that 50-ish, 55?

04:03:55.005 --> 04:03:55.838
MATT: Yeah, we'll say.

04:03:55.838 --> 04:03:56.671
Make a constitution check,

04:03:56.672 --> 04:03:58.644
because there is a patch
of brown mold there

04:03:58.645 --> 04:03:59.615
that nobody cleared.

04:03:59.616 --> 04:04:00.782
MARISHA: That's fine.

04:04:03.265 --> 04:04:06.015
Well, that could've been fine.
That could've been fine.

04:04:09.324 --> 04:04:10.511
13.

04:04:10.512 --> 04:04:12.814
MATT: 13.
MARISHA: It's not good, is it?

04:04:12.815 --> 04:04:13.854
MATT: You take--

04:04:13.855 --> 04:04:15.104
MARISHA: To check?

04:04:15.105 --> 04:04:16.404
Do I want to burn this?

04:04:16.405 --> 04:04:17.434
No, I don't.

04:04:17.435 --> 04:04:18.268
Give it to me.

04:04:19.455 --> 04:04:22.554
MATT: Okay, so you're
taking it, correct?

04:04:22.555 --> 04:04:24.224
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.
MATT: All right.

04:04:24.225 --> 04:04:25.477
You take 19 points of cold damage.

04:04:25.478 --> 04:04:26.674
SAM: Ooh.
MARISHA: Okay.

04:04:26.675 --> 04:04:29.204
MATT: As the brown mold
is now siphoning the heat

04:04:29.205 --> 04:04:30.364
out of your body as you land.

04:04:30.365 --> 04:04:31.603
MARISHA: Whatever, I'm good.

04:04:31.604 --> 04:04:33.554
MATT: But the room is
now filled with energy.

04:04:33.555 --> 04:04:34.525
That finishes your go.

04:04:34.525 --> 04:04:35.425
Jester, you're up.

04:04:36.295 --> 04:04:41.295
LAURA: I'm going to cast
(blows raspberries) Guiding Bolt

04:04:41.405 --> 04:04:44.344
at 1st-level right at Lucien.

04:04:44.345 --> 04:04:45.178
MATT: Go for it.

04:04:45.179 --> 04:04:47.928
Roll for an attack on that.
SAM: Pew!

04:04:49.937 --> 04:04:52.407
LAURA: That is a 24.

04:04:52.408 --> 04:04:54.174
Does it hit?
MATT: 24, that definitely hits.

04:04:54.175 --> 04:04:57.298
LAURA: So that's 4d6 radiant damage.

04:04:58.775 --> 04:04:59.645
TALIESIN: I'm holding you up?

04:04:59.646 --> 04:05:01.795
MARISHA: Yeah, you're holding me up.

04:05:01.796 --> 04:05:04.894
LAURA: (counting)
15 points of radiant damage,

04:05:04.895 --> 04:05:08.954
and the next attack has
advantage against him.

04:05:08.955 --> 04:05:09.788
SAM: Ooh, nice.

04:05:09.789 --> 04:05:11.214
MATT: All righty.

04:05:11.215 --> 04:05:12.764
LAURA: And I'm going to use my movement

04:05:12.765 --> 04:05:14.814
to back up into the hallway.

04:05:14.815 --> 04:05:15.908
MATT: So you just get--
LAURA: Out of the--

04:05:15.909 --> 04:05:17.233
MATT: -- the fuck out of
the radius, all right.

04:05:17.234 --> 04:05:18.591
So you are back up in the hall,

04:05:18.592 --> 04:05:19.982
and you can hear the footsteps,

04:05:19.983 --> 04:05:24.914
approaching behind, of Caleb
and Nott a little ways down.

04:05:24.915 --> 04:05:25.924
All right, that finishes.

04:05:25.925 --> 04:05:26.994
LIAM: While I'm running,

04:05:26.995 --> 04:05:31.554
I'm going to cast Globe
of Invulnerability.

04:05:31.555 --> 04:05:32.812
MATT: On yourself?
LIAM: On myself.

04:05:32.813 --> 04:05:34.304
MATT: You got it, all right.
LIAM: While running.

04:05:34.305 --> 04:05:35.844
MATT: So as you're running,
you go ahead and--

04:05:35.845 --> 04:05:38.503
Explain what that looks like.

04:05:38.504 --> 04:05:39.674
Because you're running into darkness right now.

04:05:39.675 --> 04:05:40.814
There's no light source ahead of you.

04:05:40.815 --> 04:05:43.854
LIAM: Well, there were globules,

04:05:43.855 --> 04:05:48.618
but as soon as I cast the words,

04:05:51.565 --> 04:05:53.444
a very pale, pale blue,

04:05:53.445 --> 04:05:56.154
crystal clear sphere just goes voof,

04:05:56.155 --> 04:05:57.614
and is on both side--

04:05:57.615 --> 04:05:58.844
Well, you're ahead of me, probably,

04:05:58.845 --> 04:06:01.958
so it goes out 10 feet
in each direction?

04:06:03.065 --> 04:06:03.930
MATT: I think it's a 10-foot radius.

04:06:03.931 --> 04:06:05.028
LIAM: 10-foot radius,

04:06:05.029 --> 04:06:09.344
so it's almost like a
large crystal bubble,

04:06:09.345 --> 04:06:10.934
like in The Explorers.

04:06:10.935 --> 04:06:13.456
SAM: Oh, yeah.
MATT: Very cool, all right.

04:06:13.457 --> 04:06:16.082
SAM: Contemporary movie
that we all know and love.

04:06:16.083 --> 04:06:18.074
MATT: Some of us were in.
SAM: You guys know.

04:06:18.075 --> 04:06:18.975
MATT: Technically.

04:06:18.976 --> 04:06:21.414
TALIESIN: Some of us were in it, thank you.
SAM: Oh, that's right, you were in it.

04:06:21.415 --> 04:06:23.534
MATT: All right, it is now Lucien's turn.

04:06:23.535 --> 04:06:24.368
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

04:06:24.369 --> 04:06:25.604
TALIESIN: Nickel on my--

04:06:25.605 --> 04:06:29.164
MATT: Lucien, at the start of his turn, shifts.

04:06:29.165 --> 04:06:31.683
SAM: Was your name Amadeus or something? No.

04:06:31.684 --> 04:06:33.101
TALIESIN: Ludwig.
MATT: The path that way,

04:06:34.075 --> 04:06:36.154
so it now encompasses the
whole front part of the room,

04:06:36.155 --> 04:06:36.988
and you can see it.

04:06:36.989 --> 04:06:39.414
Like, you now see that this
is a very helpful endeavor

04:06:39.415 --> 04:06:40.574
to see where this cone is facing

04:06:40.575 --> 04:06:42.784
as he shifts the eye
(squishing) into place,

04:06:42.785 --> 04:06:44.224
and he (groans) picks the thing up,

04:06:44.225 --> 04:06:47.736
and goes, "Well, this really
fucks up my plans a bit.

04:06:49.927 --> 04:06:51.304
"(sighs)

04:06:51.305 --> 04:06:53.568
"But well played.
I cannot lie, well played.

04:06:55.105 --> 04:06:57.874
"Cree, take care of this."

04:06:57.875 --> 04:06:59.374
SAM: Take care of this?

04:06:59.375 --> 04:07:00.808
MARISHA: He's going to try and bounce.

04:07:00.809 --> 04:07:03.850
MATT: It's now Fjord's turn.

04:07:03.851 --> 04:07:05.659
SAM: Not going to heal
his friends or anything?

04:07:05.660 --> 04:07:07.164
MARISHA: He doesn't
give a fuck about them.

04:07:07.165 --> 04:07:09.291
SAM: But they're his friends!

04:07:09.292 --> 04:07:10.814
MARISHA: (scoffs)

04:07:10.815 --> 04:07:13.323
TRAVIS: I'm going to run 30 feet into--

04:07:13.324 --> 04:07:14.872
MATT: Actually, and he will move.

04:07:14.873 --> 04:07:18.048
He was going to move back about there,

04:07:19.015 --> 04:07:23.423
and keep that at about
that radius there.

04:07:23.424 --> 04:07:26.841
and keep that at about
that radius there.

04:07:28.098 --> 04:07:29.138
Yeah, about there.

04:07:29.139 --> 04:07:32.564
TRAVIS: So that cone is covering
all of his downed people?

04:07:32.565 --> 04:07:33.398
MATT: Yep.

04:07:36.575 --> 04:07:37.575
ASHLEY: That's smart.

04:07:38.645 --> 04:07:39.478
TRAVIS: That is smart.

04:07:42.750 --> 04:07:45.083
MATT: So, Fjord, what you doing?

04:07:45.996 --> 04:07:48.163
SAM: Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.

04:07:49.603 --> 04:07:52.886
TRAVIS: (sighs heavily)

04:08:01.745 --> 04:08:04.205
Yeah, who is--

04:08:05.299 --> 04:08:06.132
Man.

04:08:08.157 --> 04:08:09.374
Who is that?

04:08:10.245 --> 04:08:13.948
MATT: That's Zoran, and he
would be outside the cone.

04:08:18.525 --> 04:08:20.087
TRAVIS: Take what you're given.

04:08:20.088 --> 04:08:22.744
I will run up to the
edge, straight forward,

04:08:22.745 --> 04:08:24.958
towards the cone, stopping short of it.

04:08:25.915 --> 04:08:26.748
MATT: All right.

04:08:27.675 --> 04:08:29.254
TRAVIS: The gate is
worthless at this point,

04:08:29.255 --> 04:08:32.114
because, if he looks at
the other side, it's gone,

04:08:32.115 --> 04:08:35.055
and it's a spell that's wasted.

04:08:35.056 --> 04:08:39.724
With my bonus action,
I will cast Far Step,

04:08:39.725 --> 04:08:44.725
and I will jump over the cone

04:08:45.185 --> 04:08:47.064
to where Zoran is on the other side.

04:08:47.065 --> 04:08:48.330
MATT: All right, so there?
MARISHA: That's cool.

04:08:48.331 --> 04:08:49.488
LIAM: Good to know.

04:08:49.489 --> 04:08:53.624
TRAVIS: And I will fucking swing
away at Zoran on the ground

04:08:53.625 --> 04:08:54.964
with advantage on my attacks

04:08:54.965 --> 04:08:55.798
because he's prone.
MARISHA: Come on.

04:08:55.798 --> 04:08:56.631
SAM: Ooh.

04:08:58.025 --> 04:08:59.482
MATT: All right.
LIAM: That's cold.

04:08:59.483 --> 04:09:01.041
SAM: Savage.
TRAVIS: Does that sound right?

04:09:01.042 --> 04:09:02.976
MARISHA: Get rid of those death saves.

04:09:02.977 --> 04:09:04.734
MATT: So you're just striking into him?

04:09:04.735 --> 04:09:05.568
Go for it.

04:09:05.568 --> 04:09:06.445
All right, so you go ahead

04:09:06.446 --> 04:09:08.666
and roll attack twice with advantage.

04:09:08.667 --> 04:09:09.500
MARISHA: Come on, come on.

04:09:09.501 --> 04:09:12.325
SAM: He's going to kill Zoran
worse than he killed those rangers.

04:09:12.326 --> 04:09:13.195
(laughter)

04:09:13.196 --> 04:09:15.437
MATT: Go, roll attack twice with advantage.

04:09:19.635 --> 04:09:22.194
TRAVIS: Yeah, I can't shoot a spell out into it.

04:09:22.195 --> 04:09:24.112
It'll get canceled out.

04:09:27.802 --> 04:09:28.635
Plus.

04:09:30.475 --> 04:09:32.704
That's 30 to hit.

04:09:32.705 --> 04:09:35.555
MATT: That's a hit, it's an auto-crit,
he loses two death saves.

04:09:38.205 --> 04:09:39.396
TRAVIS: Oh.
MARISHA AND TALIESIN: Yeah.

04:09:39.397 --> 04:09:40.670
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Okay.

04:09:40.671 --> 04:09:41.961
MARISHA: Shaving off death saves.

04:09:41.962 --> 04:09:43.864
TRAVIS: Do I need to roll damage?

04:09:43.865 --> 04:09:44.924
MATT: You don't. You just hit,

04:09:44.925 --> 04:09:45.885
and it takes off death saves,

04:09:45.886 --> 04:09:47.666
so you roll a second
attack with advantage.

04:09:47.667 --> 04:09:49.457
MARISHA: And you kill him.
LAURA: And you'll kill him kill him.

04:09:49.458 --> 04:09:50.833
MARISHA: (whispers) Kill him.

04:09:50.834 --> 04:09:54.050
SAM: (whispers) Murder, murder.

04:09:54.051 --> 04:09:56.028
LIAM: ♪ Agony ♪

04:09:57.300 --> 04:09:58.594
TALIESIN: I think I know
what he's thinking.

04:09:58.595 --> 04:10:01.254
TRAVIS: Yeah, how much space did I burn

04:10:01.255 --> 04:10:05.424
from the entrance to
the tip of the field,

04:10:05.425 --> 04:10:07.084
the anti-magic cone?

04:10:07.085 --> 04:10:07.918
MATT: From there to here?

04:10:07.919 --> 04:10:09.254
TRAVIS: Yeah.

04:10:09.255 --> 04:10:11.034
Oh, no, from where I
was stationed to the--

04:10:11.035 --> 04:10:11.868
MATT: Right.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

04:10:11.869 --> 04:10:12.956
MATT: To where you are now?

04:10:12.957 --> 04:10:14.554
TRAVIS: No, no, from
where I first started,

04:10:14.555 --> 04:10:16.935
the entrance to the tunnel
to the tip of the--

04:10:16.936 --> 04:10:18.234
LAURA: That was, like, 15 feet?

04:10:18.235 --> 04:10:20.635
MATT: That was about 20-- hold on,

04:10:23.755 --> 04:10:24.588
25 feet.

04:10:25.525 --> 04:10:26.358
TRAVIS: It was 25 feet?

04:10:26.358 --> 04:10:27.191
MATT: Yes.
TRAVIS: Okay.

04:10:27.192 --> 04:10:28.604
I only have 30 feet,
so I can't get there.

04:10:28.605 --> 04:10:30.714
I'm going to smoke this motherfucker.

04:10:30.715 --> 04:10:32.632
MATT: All right, go for it.

04:10:33.975 --> 04:10:34.808
TRAVIS: That's cocked.

04:10:35.905 --> 04:10:37.338
Yeah, that's 28.

04:10:39.055 --> 04:10:40.262
MATT: How do you want to do this?

04:10:40.263 --> 04:10:41.374
SAM: (cackles)

04:10:41.375 --> 04:10:45.114
MATT: He is face down on
the ground, and is out.

04:10:45.115 --> 04:10:47.034
The first strike is, you carve into him.

04:10:47.035 --> 04:10:48.924
The body just gives in.

04:10:48.925 --> 04:10:50.044
TRAVIS: I'll look up at Lucien,

04:10:50.045 --> 04:10:51.015
I'll take the Star Razor,

04:10:51.016 --> 04:10:52.889
I'll shove it in his neck, and turn it.

04:10:52.890 --> 04:10:54.414
SAM: (groans)

04:10:54.415 --> 04:10:56.944
MATT: The head just
dislodges a few inches.

04:10:56.945 --> 04:10:58.845
TRAVIS: No way out of
this fight, my friend.

04:11:01.198 --> 04:11:02.281
MATT: "Apparently.

04:11:03.637 --> 04:11:04.470
"Well."

04:11:05.305 --> 04:11:06.138
That finish your turn?

04:11:06.139 --> 04:11:07.237
TRAVIS: It does.

04:11:07.238 --> 04:11:08.071
MATT: At the end of your
turn, he's going to use

04:11:08.072 --> 04:11:09.486
two of his legendary actions

04:11:09.487 --> 04:11:10.818
to shift focus.

04:11:14.495 --> 04:11:15.534
TRAVIS: Look over here.

04:11:15.535 --> 04:11:16.704
MATT: Shifts it that way.

04:11:16.705 --> 04:11:18.738
MARISHA: Yeah, that's a
good call, good idea.

04:11:19.925 --> 04:11:22.175
MATT: Finishing your turn,
it is now Cree's turn.

04:11:24.457 --> 04:11:25.522
(as Lucian) "Yes, well."

04:11:25.523 --> 04:11:28.364
TRAVIS: Two legendaries a turn, okay.

04:11:28.365 --> 04:11:30.420
MATT: "I guess there's only
one thing left to do."

04:11:30.421 --> 04:11:31.446
MARISHA: Mmm.

04:11:33.365 --> 04:11:37.528
MATT: Cree goes ahead and
picks up her backpack,

04:11:38.605 --> 04:11:39.438
darts over.

04:11:40.671 --> 04:11:41.764
LAURA: You're going to try a
Dimension Door, aren't you?

04:11:41.765 --> 04:11:43.814
MARISHA: Absolutely, absolutely.

04:11:43.815 --> 04:11:46.724
MATT: Takes her cloak, this
deep red, furred cloak,

04:11:46.725 --> 04:11:50.879
wraps it around Lucien, and
both of them (whoosh) vanish.

04:11:50.880 --> 04:11:52.055
LAURA: Of course.
TALIESIN: Wait.

04:11:53.525 --> 04:11:54.664
Can you--
SAM: He can't Counterspell.

04:11:54.665 --> 04:11:55.954
He's in the cone.

04:11:55.955 --> 04:11:58.024
TALIESIN: Yeah, oh, he's in the cone?

04:11:58.025 --> 04:11:59.675
SAM: Fjord is in the cone right now.

04:12:00.865 --> 04:12:02.041
MATT: Yeah.
MARISHA: Are you thinking of Essek?

04:12:02.042 --> 04:12:03.336
TALIESIN: Essek-- can Essek?

04:12:03.337 --> 04:12:05.019
MARISHA: Essek's not close enough.
MATT: It's a 60-foot range.

04:12:05.020 --> 04:12:07.074
TALIESIN: Fuck.
SAM: Super far away.

04:12:07.075 --> 04:12:09.394
TRAVIS: Matt, you are fucking smart.

04:12:09.395 --> 04:12:11.108
SAM: Well, we're not bad.

04:12:11.945 --> 04:12:13.285
TRAVIS: No, I know.

04:12:13.286 --> 04:12:15.318
MATT: (zooming noises)

04:12:15.319 --> 04:12:17.565
TRAVIS: Legendaries to shift the focus.

04:12:17.566 --> 04:12:19.384
God, I thought I got close enough.

04:12:19.385 --> 04:12:20.285
TALIESIN: You did so well.

04:12:20.286 --> 04:12:22.622
TRAVIS: I was doing my best Sam Riegel.

04:12:22.623 --> 04:12:23.777
SAM: (laughs)
TALIESIN: You did so well.

04:12:23.778 --> 04:12:24.993
SAM: You did great.
TRAVIS: I was trying to--

04:12:24.994 --> 04:12:26.777
SAM: You did great.

04:12:28.003 --> 04:12:29.084
MATT: Technically, we
are out of initiative

04:12:29.085 --> 04:12:31.554
as everybody else on the
field is unconscious

04:12:31.555 --> 04:12:33.544
that would be considered
your enemies here.

04:12:33.545 --> 04:12:35.114
LAURA: Then we slice them.

04:12:35.115 --> 04:12:36.458
MARISHA: Yeah, we clear them.

04:12:37.645 --> 04:12:39.774
MATT: All right, as you both catch up.
MARISHA: Beau's right there.

04:12:39.775 --> 04:12:41.324
SAM: We don't hear-- as we're running,

04:12:41.325 --> 04:12:44.154
we don't hear anyone apparate behind us

04:12:44.155 --> 04:12:45.481
or anything, right?
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, no shit, yeah.

04:12:45.482 --> 04:12:47.684
TALIESIN: Oh, but, but,
but, wait, wait, wait.

04:12:47.685 --> 04:12:48.864
Oh, no, you're not
close enough, are you?

04:12:48.865 --> 04:12:49.698
Nevermind.

04:12:49.699 --> 04:12:52.555
TRAVIS: Do you need to see with
Dimension Door or your don't?

04:12:52.556 --> 04:12:54.911
MATT: You do not have to see.

04:12:54.912 --> 04:12:55.745
You don't even have to know.

04:12:55.745 --> 04:12:56.578
You can just imagine it,

04:12:56.579 --> 04:12:58.188
which can put you in the walls and shit,

04:12:58.189 --> 04:12:59.022
but they've been here before.

04:12:59.023 --> 04:13:00.144
TALIESIN: You were in the cone?

04:13:00.145 --> 04:13:00.978
MARISHA: I was in the cone.

04:13:00.979 --> 04:13:02.262
LAURA: They're 500 feet.

04:13:02.263 --> 04:13:03.304
MATT: Yeah.
LAURA: So they're not far.

04:13:03.305 --> 04:13:04.371
They can't be <i>that</i> far away.

04:13:04.372 --> 04:13:05.205
MARISHA: They can't be that far.

04:13:05.205 --> 04:13:06.163
MATT: They're not <i>that</i> far.

04:13:06.163 --> 04:13:06.996
TALIESIN: Couldn't have done it anyway.

04:13:06.997 --> 04:13:08.394
SAM: No, but we--
TRAVIS: They know where they're--

04:13:08.395 --> 04:13:10.501
SAM: Caleb and me don't know,

04:13:10.502 --> 04:13:13.462
because we're the only two with Message.

04:13:13.463 --> 04:13:15.184
LAURA: We could <i>not</i> spend
the time to smoke these guys,

04:13:15.185 --> 04:13:17.967
and we could just run around
and start chasing them.

04:13:17.968 --> 04:13:20.274
LIAM: They would've
jumped in our direction.

04:13:20.275 --> 04:13:21.904
They didn't know we were there,
or what was going on.

04:13:21.905 --> 04:13:23.209
They're probably--
TRAVIS: I am going to smoke

04:13:23.210 --> 04:13:24.153
these people.

04:13:24.154 --> 04:13:27.264
MARISHA: I am also going to
absolutely smoke these people.

04:13:27.265 --> 04:13:30.474
Beau's right there, she's
going to start chucking away

04:13:30.475 --> 04:13:32.004
on whoever--
TALIESIN: Grab a head.

04:13:32.005 --> 04:13:33.874
MATT: Out of initiative
above this moment.

04:13:33.875 --> 04:13:36.134
LIAM: We don't run into them, running in?

04:13:36.135 --> 04:13:37.264
MATT: No, you do not.

04:13:37.265 --> 04:13:38.215
You catch up to everybody else,

04:13:38.216 --> 04:13:40.050
and you, Fjord, Jester.

04:13:40.051 --> 04:13:41.373
TALIESIN: Heads off.

04:13:41.374 --> 04:13:42.337
MATT: Otis and Tyffial.

04:13:42.338 --> 04:13:44.344
SAM: Wait, wait!

04:13:44.345 --> 04:13:46.301
Leave Otis for me.

04:13:46.302 --> 04:13:47.394
(laughter)

04:13:47.395 --> 04:13:50.064
MARISHA: I'm about to, like,
break Otis's neck,

04:13:50.065 --> 04:13:50.898
and then I--

04:13:52.040 --> 04:13:53.884
LAURA: (laughs)

04:13:53.885 --> 04:13:55.289
SAM: Crossbow in the mouth.

04:13:55.290 --> 04:13:57.773
(laughter)

04:13:57.774 --> 04:13:59.024
Thunk.

04:13:59.025 --> 04:14:00.414
LIAM: Where are the rest,
where are the rest?

04:14:00.415 --> 04:14:01.248
MATT: Done.

04:14:01.249 --> 04:14:02.824
MARISHA: They Dimension Door'ed
that way.

04:14:02.825 --> 04:14:04.327
LIAM: We know they want that way?

04:14:04.328 --> 04:14:05.161
How do you know which way they went?

04:14:05.162 --> 04:14:06.826
TRAVIS: We're assuming.
MARISHA: Well, we're assuming.

04:14:06.827 --> 04:14:07.660
They could've--

04:14:07.660 --> 04:14:08.657
LAURA: They're going to the Somnovem ward.

04:14:08.657 --> 04:14:09.490
ASHLEY: I'm going to give them

04:14:09.490 --> 04:14:10.323
a quick check.
LIAM: Then we need to go?

04:14:10.323 --> 04:14:11.156
ASHLEY: Check their body,

04:14:11.157 --> 04:14:12.954
see-- do they have anything?
MARISHA: Check everything.

04:14:12.955 --> 04:14:14.794
LIAM: We don't have time for that.

04:14:14.795 --> 04:14:16.654
ASHLEY: Well, I don't know if they have our bag.

04:14:16.655 --> 04:14:18.320
SAM: Yeah, our shit!
ASHLEY: Our shit!

04:14:18.321 --> 04:14:19.623
SAM: Otis had our shit,
let's dig through.

04:14:19.624 --> 04:14:20.893
MARISHA: Yeah, do they have our bag?

04:14:20.894 --> 04:14:21.934
SAM: (rifling noises)

04:14:21.935 --> 04:14:24.014
MATT: Make an investigation check.
SAM: I'll check Otis, you check--

04:14:24.015 --> 04:14:25.847
MARISHA: Investigation check?
ASHLEY: Okay.

04:14:25.848 --> 04:14:27.624
MARISHA: Can I assist Yash?

04:14:27.625 --> 04:14:28.714
SAM: There's three bodies, right?

04:14:28.715 --> 04:14:29.685
Check somebody else.
LAURA: We're rolling investigation,

04:14:29.686 --> 04:14:31.014
why wouldn't you do it?

04:14:31.015 --> 04:14:33.244
MARISHA: Because I just
tried to snap his neck,

04:14:33.245 --> 04:14:34.434
unless I can do something else.

04:14:34.435 --> 04:14:36.114
LAURA: You just dropped him, so.

04:14:36.115 --> 04:14:36.948
SAM: Yeah, do whatever.
LAURA: Beau can do it,

04:14:36.949 --> 04:14:38.112
you can do it.

04:14:38.113 --> 04:14:39.538
MARISHA: Okay, okay, we'll all
investigate, all of us.

04:14:39.539 --> 04:14:40.769
TRAVIS: 18.

04:14:42.903 --> 04:14:43.736
SAM: 23.

04:14:43.736 --> 04:14:44.569
LIAM: I'm staying at the entrance.

04:14:44.570 --> 04:14:46.274
LAURA: I'm staying at the entrance.

04:14:46.275 --> 04:14:47.108
I'm not going in there.

04:14:47.109 --> 04:14:48.154
MARISHA: 20 total.

04:14:48.155 --> 04:14:51.874
MATT: Okay, beyond their supplies,

04:14:51.875 --> 04:14:53.154
Bag of Holding is not on them.

04:14:53.155 --> 04:14:54.135
MARISHA: Son of a bitch!

04:14:54.136 --> 04:14:55.816
LAURA: Let's go, let's go!
TRAVIS: Time to go.

04:14:55.817 --> 04:14:57.154
SAM: Anything else useful?

04:14:57.155 --> 04:14:58.438
MARISHA: Anything useful?

04:14:59.404 --> 04:15:01.034
MATT: Not really, other than their weapons,

04:15:01.035 --> 04:15:02.484
which could be useful,
if you want to grab them.

04:15:02.485 --> 04:15:03.318
MARISHA: Why not?

04:15:03.319 --> 04:15:04.684
Fine, we grab their weapons.

04:15:04.685 --> 04:15:05.854
Anything?

04:15:05.855 --> 04:15:07.014
Nothing else, nothing?

04:15:07.015 --> 04:15:08.594
TALIESIN: Detect Magic.

04:15:08.595 --> 04:15:10.445
Are any of those weapons interesting?

04:15:11.345 --> 04:15:12.819
LAURA: As we're running, we have to go.

04:15:12.820 --> 04:15:14.153
LIAM: We have to go.

04:15:18.405 --> 04:15:19.624
MATT: Zoran's maul.

04:15:19.625 --> 04:15:21.054
TALIESIN: Let's grab that.

04:15:21.055 --> 04:15:23.434
MATT: Otis's crossbow, a light crossbow.

04:15:23.435 --> 04:15:24.425
MARISHA: Okay.

04:15:24.426 --> 04:15:27.282
MATT: And Tyffial's longsword
all emit a magical aura.

04:15:27.283 --> 04:15:28.269
MARISHA: All right, we grab their weapons.

04:15:28.270 --> 04:15:29.934
TALIESIN: Grab the weapons--
TRAVIS: We're running.

04:15:29.935 --> 04:15:30.893
MARISHA: Yeah, we run.

04:15:30.894 --> 04:15:33.008
MATT: All right, as you begin
running down the hallway,

04:15:34.775 --> 04:15:36.833
a voice creeps into...

04:15:38.716 --> 04:15:39.992
both of your heads.

04:15:39.993 --> 04:15:41.226
TALIESIN: Fuck.
SAM: Oh.

04:15:44.585 --> 04:15:49.514
MATT: "I'm not going to lie,
that was inspired, well thought out.

04:15:49.515 --> 04:15:51.016
"More than I expected.

04:15:52.455 --> 04:15:53.655
"You're brave.

04:15:55.015 --> 04:15:59.234
"But you've also shown to be
more of a thorn in my side

04:15:59.235 --> 04:16:01.134
"than I ever gave you credit for.

04:16:01.135 --> 04:16:02.638
"That's not going to fly.

04:16:03.495 --> 04:16:08.476
"But I'm excited for you to
see my handiwork soon enough."

04:16:10.963 --> 04:16:13.304
(rumbling)

04:16:13.305 --> 04:16:15.628
You hear this rumbling sound ahead.

04:16:18.635 --> 04:16:21.994
As the hallway ahead of you begins to shake.

04:16:21.995 --> 04:16:22.828
SAM: ♪ Shakin' my way ♪

04:16:22.829 --> 04:16:24.060
MARISHA: He's collapsing the tunnel.

04:16:24.061 --> 04:16:25.185
He's collapsing the tunnel!

04:16:25.186 --> 04:16:27.505
MATT: (rumbling)

04:16:27.506 --> 04:16:29.824
(crashing)
MARISHA: Don't--

04:16:29.825 --> 04:16:32.424
MATT: Bits of rock and stone
are beginning to fall.

04:16:32.425 --> 04:16:34.104
Do you continue forward,
or do you head back?

04:16:34.105 --> 04:16:35.764
LIAM: This is this?

04:16:35.765 --> 04:16:37.984
MATT: You guys are just now
hitting the intersection.

04:16:37.985 --> 04:16:39.064
MARISHA: There's no way.

04:16:39.065 --> 04:16:40.035
TALIESIN: No.

04:16:40.036 --> 04:16:41.918
SAM: No way what?
TRAVIS: Gotta go forward.

04:16:41.919 --> 04:16:43.534
That's game over if that's shut off.

04:16:43.535 --> 04:16:44.564
We got nothing else.

04:16:44.565 --> 04:16:47.698
MARISHA: Can everyone-- haul ass!

04:16:48.825 --> 04:16:49.786
SAM: Oh my god, if we
get trapped in here.

04:16:49.787 --> 04:16:51.940
LAURA: We're going to get buried,
we're going to get buried.

04:16:51.941 --> 04:16:53.823
TRAVIS: Otherwise, we lose.
MARISHA: I don't want to die.

04:16:53.824 --> 04:16:55.804
Some of us are fast, some aren't.

04:16:55.805 --> 04:16:57.644
SAM: You can Dimension Door.

04:16:57.645 --> 04:16:58.478
MARISHA: Yeah.

04:16:59.655 --> 04:17:01.834
TRAVIS: Nope, because nobody got a full rest.

04:17:01.835 --> 04:17:04.684
LAURA: I've got one
5th-level spell left, that's it.

04:17:04.685 --> 04:17:05.518
MARISHA: Fuck.

04:17:05.519 --> 04:17:06.554
LAURA: I can Dimension Door one time,

04:17:06.555 --> 04:17:08.240
and then everything's
wiped on the highs.

04:17:08.241 --> 04:17:09.994
TRAVIS: The full rest fucked us.

04:17:09.995 --> 04:17:11.254
LIAM: You got any fours?

04:17:11.255 --> 04:17:12.088
LAURA: Nope.

04:17:13.095 --> 04:17:14.694
TRAVIS: We can't go in
there without, like--

04:17:14.695 --> 04:17:17.560
TALIESIN: No, this is
what broke us last time.

04:17:17.561 --> 04:17:19.076
LAURA: We got to stop.

04:17:19.077 --> 04:17:20.876
TALIESIN: We have to regroup.

04:17:20.877 --> 04:17:22.226
We have to assume this is not something

04:17:22.227 --> 04:17:23.794
that's going to happen
immediately and regroup.

04:17:23.795 --> 04:17:26.834
MARISHA: We did okay, the trap
technically worked, and--

04:17:26.835 --> 04:17:27.874
SAM: Should we get out of here?

04:17:27.875 --> 04:17:29.634
Crawl up the rope?

04:17:29.635 --> 04:17:31.384
I feel like we're going
to get buried in here.

04:17:31.385 --> 04:17:33.044
MARISHA: We can try and
go down the center,

04:17:33.045 --> 04:17:34.144
and cut them off that way.

04:17:34.145 --> 04:17:36.884
LAURA: If we back up a little bit,
does the rumbling stop?

04:17:36.885 --> 04:17:40.224
Like, how far does the
ceiling collapse to?

04:17:40.225 --> 04:17:41.714
MATT: Well, if you stop and--

04:17:41.715 --> 04:17:42.764
Are you not moving forward?

04:17:42.765 --> 04:17:43.598
LAURA: We're not going to move forward

04:17:43.599 --> 04:17:44.982
if the ceiling's collapsing.

04:17:44.983 --> 04:17:46.998
MATT: Okay, the ceiling
around you isn't collapsing.

04:17:48.055 --> 04:17:49.547
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MATT: But the hall above,

04:17:49.548 --> 04:17:50.638
you're seeing parts-- (crumbling)

04:17:50.639 --> 04:17:53.454
TRAVIS: It's 200 feet of hallway,
and shit's moving, and falling,

04:17:53.455 --> 04:17:55.384
and we don't have spells.

04:17:55.385 --> 04:17:56.984
MARISHA: It's not the way to die.

04:17:56.985 --> 04:17:58.874
TRAVIS: 200-plus feet, yeah.

04:17:58.875 --> 04:18:01.051
LIAM: And having to climb
up, and climb walls.

04:18:01.052 --> 04:18:02.744
TALIESIN: At the very least,
we have to wait for it

04:18:02.745 --> 04:18:05.014
to stop falling and re--

04:18:05.015 --> 04:18:07.074
MATT: About a minute goes by

04:18:07.075 --> 04:18:08.895
before the shaking stops--

04:18:09.730 --> 04:18:14.264
MATT: -- localized around
the hall before you,

04:18:14.265 --> 04:18:16.294
some sort of magical quake.

04:18:16.295 --> 04:18:17.506
SAM: ♪ Quakin' my way ♪
MARISHA: Yeah.

04:18:17.507 --> 04:18:19.464
MATT: As it subsides and
the dust begins to settle,

04:18:19.465 --> 04:18:23.564
the hallway is not entirely collapsed,

04:18:23.565 --> 04:18:26.124
but there is definitely a lot
of fallen debris in the way

04:18:26.125 --> 04:18:27.975
that will probably have to be cleared

04:18:28.925 --> 04:18:30.724
before there's any chance
of moving forward,

04:18:30.725 --> 04:18:33.114
and you're not certain how
much of it has fallen in,

04:18:33.115 --> 04:18:35.444
not without a proper inspection.

04:18:35.445 --> 04:18:37.284
But as that dust begins to settle a bit,

04:18:37.285 --> 04:18:39.634
and you all take a deep breath,

04:18:39.635 --> 04:18:41.844
the voice comes back once more.

04:18:41.845 --> 04:18:42.895
MARISHA: This asshole.

04:18:44.755 --> 04:18:46.254
MATT: "Just putting a bit
of space between us.

04:18:46.255 --> 04:18:47.674
"You understand.

04:18:47.675 --> 04:18:49.534
"I've got important work to do.

04:18:49.535 --> 04:18:52.068
"But please, come along.

04:18:53.345 --> 04:18:57.068
"Hate for no one to see the
product of our hard work."

04:19:00.005 --> 04:19:02.474
And as you stand there,
in the middle of the hall,

04:19:02.475 --> 04:19:07.268
taking in this
partial victory, partial loss,

04:19:08.485 --> 04:19:12.625
in the quiet silence
and darkness of Aeor.

04:19:13.933 --> 04:19:16.204
And we're going to
end tonight's game there.

04:19:16.205 --> 04:19:17.584
LIAM: So frustrating.

04:19:17.585 --> 04:19:18.418
SAM: Frustrating?

04:19:18.419 --> 04:19:21.177
It was a success, a rousing success.

04:19:21.178 --> 04:19:23.551
MATT: That was a rousing success.

04:19:23.552 --> 04:19:25.509
LAURA: Only two of them now.
TRAVIS: Plus a massive failure.

04:19:25.510 --> 04:19:26.744
SAM: Failure?!
MARISHA: No!

04:19:26.745 --> 04:19:29.014
LAURA: We got three kills.
SAM: We killed three of them.

04:19:29.015 --> 04:19:30.606
TRAVIS: Yeah, they were expendable,

04:19:30.607 --> 04:19:32.272
they were expendable.
MARISHA: Yeah, but we went in--

04:19:32.273 --> 04:19:34.430
ASHLEY: That's still
three less to fight.

04:19:34.431 --> 04:19:36.480
MARISHA: Three less to deal with.
SAM: Huge, huge.

04:19:36.481 --> 04:19:38.624
MARISHA: This was not going
to be the Lucien fight.

04:19:38.625 --> 04:19:40.484
Uh-uh, this was not going
to be the Lucien fight.

04:19:40.485 --> 04:19:44.574
We knew that this was only
to pick off a few fuckers,

04:19:44.575 --> 04:19:46.113
which we did.

04:19:46.114 --> 04:19:46.947
LAURA: Yeah.
ASHLEY: We did.

04:19:46.948 --> 04:19:49.669
MARISHA: Come on, Travis, you
got to take the victories.

04:19:49.670 --> 04:19:51.269
TRAVIS: How do you get a long rest

04:19:51.270 --> 04:19:52.434
before we catch up to him

04:19:52.435 --> 04:19:53.268
before he does anything?
LAURA: We don't.

04:19:53.268 --> 04:19:54.101
TRAVIS: We don't.

04:19:54.102 --> 04:19:55.607
MARISHA: Oh, I'm not talking about the long rest.

04:19:55.608 --> 04:19:57.824
TRAVIS: That's a failure,
that is a failure.

04:19:57.825 --> 04:20:00.025
I mean, we're going to
play it out anyway, but.

04:20:00.895 --> 04:20:03.284
LAURA: We're going in the same
way we went against him before,

04:20:03.285 --> 04:20:04.118
but now, there's--

04:20:04.119 --> 04:20:06.694
TRAVIS: Almost worse?
LAURA: -- only two of them.

04:20:06.695 --> 04:20:08.591
TRAVIS: If we can find them, catch up.

04:20:08.592 --> 04:20:10.384
LAURA: Sure, if we can
find them, catch up,

04:20:10.385 --> 04:20:11.611
then, maybe, we can take them.
LIAM: Run through whatever

04:20:11.612 --> 04:20:13.661
is down here with them.

04:20:13.662 --> 04:20:15.186
MATT: The good news is,

04:20:16.143 --> 04:20:17.284
whatever--

04:20:17.285 --> 04:20:19.384
whatever is living in this ruin,

04:20:19.385 --> 04:20:21.464
for the time being, they're
getting to them first.

04:20:21.465 --> 04:20:23.704
MARISHA: It's their problem now, yeah.

04:20:23.705 --> 04:20:25.274
MATT: There are a lot
of factors at work here

04:20:25.275 --> 04:20:27.564
that could work against
you and work for you,

04:20:27.565 --> 04:20:30.234
but it depends on what
you use at your disposal,

04:20:30.235 --> 04:20:32.964
and what choices you
make as we go forward.

04:20:32.965 --> 04:20:35.479
Don't think you're out
of the game on this.

04:20:35.480 --> 04:20:36.784
MARISHA: Mm-mm.

04:20:36.785 --> 04:20:38.524
LIAM: Frustrating.

04:20:38.525 --> 04:20:39.754
LAURA: But three down.

04:20:39.755 --> 04:20:40.588
TALIESIN: Three down.

04:20:40.589 --> 04:20:42.374
MARISHA: Three down is
something not to sneeze at.

04:20:42.375 --> 04:20:43.375
ASHLEY: Three down's good.

04:20:45.055 --> 04:20:47.285
TALIESIN: I'm calling it a win.

04:20:47.286 --> 04:20:48.694
SAM: I am, too.

04:20:48.695 --> 04:20:49.826
TALIESIN: That's a B-minus.

04:20:49.827 --> 04:20:51.791
SAM: Otis dead.

04:20:51.792 --> 04:20:53.084
MARISHA: Otis is dead.

04:20:53.085 --> 04:20:54.863
LAURA: We're eight against two.

04:20:55.845 --> 04:20:58.640
TALIESIN: We're not grounded,
and we're not going to Disneyland.

04:20:58.641 --> 04:20:59.684
MARISHA: (laughs)

04:20:59.685 --> 04:21:01.178
LIAM: Yeah.
TRAVIS: We'll see.

04:21:01.179 --> 04:21:02.535
LIAM: Until he brings this city.

04:21:02.536 --> 04:21:03.554
LAURA: Sure.

04:21:03.555 --> 04:21:05.777
MATT: We'll find out.

04:21:05.778 --> 04:21:08.726
At the very least, you know he's
only 500 feet ahead of you,

04:21:08.727 --> 04:21:09.560
for now.

04:21:10.931 --> 04:21:12.724
So we'll pick up there next week.

04:21:12.725 --> 04:21:14.084
Thank you all for joining us.

04:21:14.085 --> 04:21:14.925
We love you very much,

04:21:14.926 --> 04:21:17.039
and is it Thursday yet?
Good night.

04:21:17.040 --> 04:21:17.873
MARISHA: This asshole.

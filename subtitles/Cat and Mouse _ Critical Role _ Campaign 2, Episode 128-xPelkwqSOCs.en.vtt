MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to
tonight's episode of Critical Role,

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.950
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.129
and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:09.220
ALL: (discordant yelling) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:10.970
MATT: Like that.
(high-pitched laughter)

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:11.803
Whoa.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.950
Daffy Duck over there.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.930
So before we jump into tonight's episode,

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.250
we do have some announcements to get through,

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.440
beginning with the first of two sponsors, Hit Point Press.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.273
Sam.

00:00:21.273 --> 00:00:23.210
SAM: Today's sponsor is our friends at Hit Point Press

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.810
with an important rebranding

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.180
and launch of their site.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.060
To celebrate the new launch,

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.920
for the month of March,

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.750

and free packs of their animated spells.

That's free random animated spell cards free.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.580
This promotion is live now

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.560

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:48.850
Quantities are limited,

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.320
so their advice to you, don't miss this deal.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.830
And speaking of good advice,

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.810
we've got someone with us who gives amazing advice.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.488
As we know, Gale was a sitcom icon

00:01:02.488 --> 00:01:04.340
and movie mainstay of the 1980s,

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.800
but as it turns out, since then,

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.100
she has been writing one

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.220
of the most successful advice columns in America,

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.810
so thanks to Hit Point Press,

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.760
Gale is here to answer some fan letters.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.035
ASHLEY: Hello!

00:01:17.035 --> 00:01:17.868
(laughter)

00:01:17.868 --> 00:01:19.332
MATT: Oh wow.

00:01:19.332 --> 00:01:22.360
SAM: I'm going to read this first letter right here.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.220
Gale, my ex-boyfriend started dating my sister.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.920
How should I handle it?

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.423
ASHLEY: First off, boyfriend?

00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:32.730
Ugh, grody to the max.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.820
Do you, like, kiss and rub cooties

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.900
on each others' stinky bods?

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.010
Ugh, barf in my mouth.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.630
My advice, let your dumb sister have that dumb dork,

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.920
and while they're frenching in your dad's Geo Prizm,

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.221
just slingshot a (laughs)

00:01:48.221 --> 00:01:49.112
(laughter)

00:01:49.112 --> 00:01:53.142
flaming bag of dog poo into that nasty love nest,

00:01:53.142 --> 00:01:55.010
and walk away from those losers

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.322
knowing you just caused maximum carnage.

00:01:58.322 --> 00:01:59.532
As if!

00:01:59.532 --> 00:02:01.210
(laughter)

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.543
SAM: Thank you, Gale. That was great advice.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.130
We have another letter here.

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.830
Dear Gale, I have gophers in my lawn.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.200
How do I get rid of them?

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.120
ASHLEY: Aw, easy sleazy.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.690
Smack those gophies in the mouth!

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.180
Let 'em know that's your dirt, baby,

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.000
and if they don't like it, gag 'em with a spoon.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.820
Ha-ha-ha-ha (blows raspberry)

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.920
(laughter)

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.080
SAM: And one more letter from fans.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.530
You can send these in to our P.O. box whenever.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.530
This one says: Dear Gale,

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.880
My boss gave a promotion to someone else

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.530
less qualified than me.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:39.790
Do I say something?

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.795
ASHLEY: Man, don't know why you'd be bummed out

00:02:41.795 --> 00:02:44.693
about some dumb work thing, but whatevs.

00:02:44.693 --> 00:02:47.880
You know what, when I'm down in the dumper,

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.520
I grab a six pack of RC,

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.310
pop a box of Runts,

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.811
and laugh my butt off at the movie "Amadeus."

00:02:55.811 --> 00:02:56.882
(laughter)

00:02:56.882 --> 00:02:59.810
That wigged out piano dude kills me,

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.710
the way Mozart always mad goofing,

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.710
driving Salieri to plot the young prodigy's downfall

00:03:08.212 --> 00:03:11.180
until, ultimately, Salieri realizes

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.290
that, in destroying his mortal enemy,

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.170
he's actually depriving the world

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.858
of an unwritten <i>oeuvre</i>

00:03:18.858 --> 00:03:20.387
(laughter)

00:03:20.387 --> 00:03:25.387
of unparalleled musical genius. Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

00:03:25.498 --> 00:03:27.723
Old-timey people are so weird.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.700
Anyway, the best advice I can give you is

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.580
go to hitpointpress.com,

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.250
check out their new site, and let them know what you think,

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.833
and don't forget that promo, gag me with a spoon.

00:03:47.036 --> 00:03:48.391
SAM: Thank you, Gale,

00:03:48.391 --> 00:03:49.500
and thank you, Hit Point Press.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.856
Matt, back to you.

00:03:50.856 --> 00:03:52.510
MATT: Ho, ho, ho.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.830
Yes, thank you, Hit Point Press,

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.343
for allowing all of that to transpire.

00:03:58.455 --> 00:03:59.405
Oh, I'm in pain.

00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:00.413
TRAVIS: <i>Oeuvre</i>.

00:04:00.413 --> 00:04:03.080
(laughter)

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:05.523
MATT: Okay.

00:04:05.523 --> 00:04:06.540
TRAVIS: Goofin' hard.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.170
MATT: (clears throat)

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.637
And thank you to our second sponsor

00:04:09.637 --> 00:04:10.470

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.600
and "Congrats, Australia," oh no.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.310
MATT: That's the spectrum we've created.

(dragon roaring)

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.440
MATT: Welcome back.

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.243
So last we left off:

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:40.660
The Mighty Nein, after gathering some elements

00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:43.240
from their allies and preparing

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:46.750
for the journey back to the ruins of Aeor

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:50.930
in hopes of cutting off and ending the slow climb

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:52.780
the Tomb Takers are making towards the center

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:54.530
of some part of the ruin, it seems,

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.780
you wanted to try and protect yourselves

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:02.840
from the ever-prying vision of Lucien,

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:07.840
and as such, reached out to Astrid, Volstrucker,

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:10.070
from Caleb's past,

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:12.190
and requested if there was any opportunity

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:14.580
to acquire more of these devices,

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:16.990
these magical items, these amulets

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:19.823
that could protect from divination.

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:24.140
Astrid was able to locate where they were kept,

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:25.290
though it was beyond her realm

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:26.840
to grab at the moment,

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.890
as they were currently being held

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:30.870
in a basement on the grounds

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.493
of the Vergesson Sanatorium.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.820
Now, traveling to the outskirts

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:39.100
of the Pearlbow Wilderness

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.230
on the outside of the sanatorium,

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:43.740
you encroached upon it and made a plan.

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:45.463
Dividing into two groups,

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:49.150
two groups that were curiously named,

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:53.230
one of which made their way into the far distant structure,

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:56.273
while the other waited on the out-squirts, out-squirts,

00:09:56.273 --> 00:09:58.323
the out-squirts of the forest, guys.

00:09:58.323 --> 00:09:59.950
TRAVIS: I got the out-squirts.

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:02.709
LAURA: Yeah, I think all of us do, right?
MATT: We've all, yeah.

00:10:02.709 --> 00:10:03.809
TALIESIN: It's a problem.
MARISHA: Oh no.

00:10:03.809 --> 00:10:07.500
MATT: As that group began to
make their way through the basement,

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.423
encountering guards that they then crushed,

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.120
searching about, and eventually getting into the basement,

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:18.063
where a magical barrier prevented their continuation.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:21.000
Jumping magically to the other side,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.690
Jester and Veth grabbed their quarry,

00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:28.680
a container that seemed to hold exactly what they seek,

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:32.163
and upon returning to the interior of this basement chamber,

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.210
as they were about to leave,

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:38.390
giving the call to the rest of their group

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:39.663
that it was time to go,

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:43.160
the teleportation didn't function.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.833
The spell seemed to dissipate,

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:48.380
and as the three of them,

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:51.040
Jester, Veth, and Caleb, looked back up the staircase,

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:53.770
the only exit from the room from which they came,

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:58.020
they were met with the face of Trent Ikithon.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:59.060
Meanwhile.

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:00.074
SAM and LAURA: Oh!

00:11:00.074 --> 00:11:01.599
TRAVIS: Meanwhile?
LAURA: Ooh!

00:11:02.442 --> 00:11:03.275
Shit!
MATT: Beauregard

00:11:03.275 --> 00:11:06.520
has been on top of the tower,

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:10.760
keeping an eye out as more and more guards swarm inward

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.040
towards this location,

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.850
and the rest of the group remains hidden

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:19.360
by a fog cloud in the nearby forest,

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.380
trying to acquire the last member of their troupe

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:24.440
before, themselves, evacuating the premises.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.740
TRAVIS: Real humid in the trees.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:26.573
MATT: Yeah.

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:30.940
And so, as the three of you,

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:34.773
Caleb, Veth, and Jester, look up

00:11:35.856 --> 00:11:38.450
the barely lit staircase,

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:40.553
stepping down comfortably,

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:45.736
you see the sallow, jaundiced face

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:49.053
of Master Trent Ikithon.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.340
LIAM: DM?

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:53.173
MATT: Yes?

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.303
LIAM: Looking at Veth and Jester,

00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:59.620
Caleb takes Allura's staff,

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.450
and grinds it through phosphorous in his hand,

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:03.623
and casts Wall of Fire between them.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.420
MATT: Casts Wall of Fire between them?

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:07.253
LIAM: Yeah.

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:08.993
MATT: Okay.

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:13.130
SAM: Between us and Trent.

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:14.710
LIAM: Between us and Trent,

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:17.010
damage side facing Trent.

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:18.650
MATT: Okay.

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:19.798
LIAM: There is just enough room for that.

00:12:19.798 --> 00:12:21.346
SAM: Is Trent in the room with us?

00:12:21.346 --> 00:12:23.800
LAURA: He's coming down the steps.
MATT: He's coming down the staircase now.

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.893
LIAM: So it would be sheer against me.

00:12:25.893 --> 00:12:28.310
LAURA: And then we'd be up against the barrier.

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:31.560
LIAM: And radiating out, damage side toward Trent.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.840
MATT: So as he looks to you, and says, "Interesting,"

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.770
your first reaction is to create this Wall of Fire.

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:38.929
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: Well, I guess let's roll initiative, guys.

00:12:38.929 --> 00:12:41.340
(laughter)

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:42.650
Okay!

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:44.623
SAM: Oh no, oh no.

00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:47.420
TRAVIS: Just the three of them, or everybody?

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:48.490
MATT: Just the three of them right now.

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:50.380
TALIESIN: Okay, thank god.
SAM: You got a 20?

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:51.213
SAM: One.

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:57.004
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: That's not a good start.

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:00.603
MATT: So 25 to 20.

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:03.237
MARISHA: Oh, yikes.

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:05.430
MATT: 20 to 15.

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:06.450
LIAM: 19.

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:08.076
SAM: Ooh!
LAURA: That's good.

00:13:08.076 --> 00:13:09.409
LIAM: Or, 21, sorry.

00:13:11.525 --> 00:13:13.295
TRAVIS: It's okay, get it out, get it out.

00:13:13.295 --> 00:13:15.051
MATT: 15 to 10.
SAM: 18 over here.

00:13:15.051 --> 00:13:17.563
TRAVIS: Get a little arm shake. There you go.

00:13:17.563 --> 00:13:19.882
ASHLEY: I don't know why I wore a turtleneck.

00:13:19.882 --> 00:13:21.980
It's a little hot.

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:24.250
MATT: And Jester, what'd you get?

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:25.273
Five, okay.

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:27.123
MARISHA: Not in it.

00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:35.770
MATT: So as the wall of fire (flames whooshing).

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:39.460
LAURA: That's a big wall.
MATT: Immediately fills

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:45.030
the chamber (flames whooshing).

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:47.560
Trent goes first because he rolled pretty damn high

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:49.293
on his initiative there.

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:55.090
And the wall (flames whooshing)

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:56.358
disappears.

00:13:56.358 --> 00:13:57.829
SAM: Okay, okay, okay.
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.

00:13:57.829 --> 00:13:59.360
Okay, okay, okay.
TRAVIS: You got to use your things.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:01.520
They were pretty.
MATT: Yeah.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:02.833
LIAM: Did we hear him speak?

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:07.500
MATT: You couldn't hear it through the (flames roaring)

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.450
of the flames around you,

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:14.180
but you assume, as you've seen happening before,

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:16.911
many times before, that the wall has been dispelled.

00:14:16.911 --> 00:14:18.150
LIAM: Okay.

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:21.110
MATT: As he continues to nonchalantly walk down the stairs

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:22.706
in your direction, the flames

00:14:22.706 --> 00:14:25.450
(flames whooshing) vanishing around him,

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:28.433
as he comes into the very, very top of the chamber,

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:35.016
"I am quite curious as to what brings you here."

00:14:35.016 --> 00:14:38.250
"I am quite curious as to what brings you here."

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:40.930
LIAM: I don't know if we're still in the order,

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:43.913
but I throw Fire Bolt at him.

00:14:43.913 --> 00:14:45.163
SAM: Oh god.
MATT: Okay.

00:14:45.163 --> 00:14:48.010
LIAM: As soon as the wall is down.

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:49.120
I'm not done.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.000
MATT: Okay, so, yeah,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.280
so, that would be his turn was dispelling,

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.370
and then walking down.

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:54.430
You take your turn.

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:56.550
Go ahead and roll an attack on him.

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:57.910
LIAM: Yeah, Fire Bolt.

00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:59.166
SAM: Maybe we should talk.

00:14:59.166 --> 00:15:00.550
(laughter)

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:02.010
I think we should maybe talk.

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:03.560
He seems like he wants to talk.

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:06.593
No?

00:15:06.593 --> 00:15:07.860
LIAM: But does a 17 hit?

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:08.710
MATT: 17 does not hit.

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:10.250
LIAM: Does not hit, okay.

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:11.427
Smashes into the wall behind him.

00:15:11.427 --> 00:15:13.020
MATT: So as the bolt goes flying,

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:14.777
you can see, like, you react out,

00:15:14.777 --> 00:15:16.740
and as you fling it forward,

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:18.950
he puts a hand up for a second,

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:20.650
and it seems like it should impact,

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:22.210
and then it just glides off to the side

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:25.423
and hits the stone staircase behind him before dissipating.

00:15:28.291 --> 00:15:29.440
SAM: Oh god.

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.733
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

00:15:30.733 --> 00:15:31.900
MATT: Are you staying put?

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:35.181
LIAM: Yes.
MATT: You are all there.

00:15:36.372 --> 00:15:39.696
LIAM: I will back into Jester and Veth.

00:15:39.696 --> 00:15:41.637
MATT: Okay, so the three of you are clustered there.

00:15:41.637 --> 00:15:43.700
(footsteps)

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:44.540
SAM: My turn?

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:46.139
MATT: Now it is Veth's turn.

00:15:46.139 --> 00:15:47.484
SAM: I will--

00:15:47.484 --> 00:15:49.710
I will watch Caleb's two spells

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:53.255
just get totally bungholed by this guy.

00:15:53.255 --> 00:15:54.930
(laughs)

00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:57.740
And I'll be like: Taste my magic!

00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:58.965
(laughter)

00:15:58.965 --> 00:15:59.923
TRAVIS: Good call out.

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:05.100
SAM: And I will cast Phantasmal Force on him.

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:06.540
MATT: Okay.

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:07.373
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah.

00:16:07.373 --> 00:16:09.513
SAM: Because I'm a high-level magic user!

00:16:09.513 --> 00:16:10.900
MATT: It's true.

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:12.300
What's the spell DC?

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.780
SAM: 16 intelligence.

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:15.340
MATT: And it's intelligence saving throw?

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:16.173
SAM: Yes.

00:16:16.173 --> 00:16:17.480
MATT: You got it.

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.313
TRAVIS: Modifier.

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:20.760
LAURA: No, did he roll a one?
TRAVIS: Say it!

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:21.674
MATT: Natural 20.

00:16:21.674 --> 00:16:23.139
(groaning)

00:16:23.139 --> 00:16:24.524
LAURA: That was not a critical fail.

00:16:24.524 --> 00:16:26.900
(laughter)

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:28.900
MATT: His eyes just shift over to you.

00:16:31.267 --> 00:16:33.847
LAURA: Oh no, my heart is beating [inaudible].

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:36.940
SAM: Bonus action, hide.

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:38.613
MATT: Behind?

00:16:38.613 --> 00:16:39.543
SAM: Caleb.

00:16:39.543 --> 00:16:40.516
MATT: Yep, which you can do.
(laughter)

00:16:40.516 --> 00:16:41.690
LIAM: She can as a halfling.
MATT: Which you can do.

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:43.736
Roll a stealth check.
TRAVIS: Steal some stuff.

00:16:43.736 --> 00:16:46.540
(laughter)

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:48.480
SAM: Stealth. Ooh.

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.313
TALIESIN: It's a lot.

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:52.690
SAM: Oh wow, 24.

00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:54.732
MATT: 24, okay.

00:16:54.732 --> 00:16:57.640
You feel like you've--

00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:01.181
you might be hidden behind Caleb, perhaps.

00:17:01.181 --> 00:17:02.621
SAM: They'll never find me here.

00:17:02.621 --> 00:17:06.011
(laughter)

00:17:06.011 --> 00:17:09.364
MATT: But you get the sense he knows
where you might loosely be.

00:17:09.364 --> 00:17:11.780
(laughter)

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:13.230
Jester, what are you doing?

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:18.890
LAURA: I am going to reach down,

00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:20.483
and grab Veth's shoulder,

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:26.190
and reach forward and grab the back of Caleb,

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:30.870
and I'm just going to try to Word of Recall again.

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:32.493
My last big spell.

00:17:33.492 --> 00:17:34.325
MATT: Okay.

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:40.520
SAM: He tasted my magic.

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:52.531
TRAVIS: I'd look, but I believe you.

00:17:52.531 --> 00:17:53.840
LAURA: Was that a Counterspell?

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:55.015
MATT: It was a Counterspell.

00:17:55.015 --> 00:17:56.150
LIAM: Counterspell, to you.

00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:57.700
You have to say Counterspell so I can Counterspell you.

00:17:57.700 --> 00:17:58.828
MATT: Right, I'm getting to it.

00:17:58.828 --> 00:17:59.661
LAURA: Oh god.

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:02.360
MATT: All right, so, at what level do you Counterspell?

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:03.193
LIAM: Third.

00:18:03.193 --> 00:18:04.467
MATT: 3rd-level? Go ahead and roll.

00:18:04.467 --> 00:18:05.692
SAM: Oh boy.
LAURA: Oh no, he rolled a 20.

00:18:05.692 --> 00:18:08.181
Did you roll a 20 again?
TRAVIS: He did.

00:18:08.181 --> 00:18:09.339
LIAM: I rolled a natural 20.

00:18:09.339 --> 00:18:11.908
(shouting)
MARISHA: No way!

00:18:11.908 --> 00:18:13.274
SAM: What happens now?!

00:18:13.274 --> 00:18:14.232
MARISHA: What happens?!

00:18:14.232 --> 00:18:16.211
SAM: I think we broke Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:18:16.211 --> 00:18:17.232
We've broken it.

00:18:17.232 --> 00:18:18.065
LAURA: It's broken?

00:18:18.065 --> 00:18:19.402
MARISHA: Oh no, we have to restart the game.

00:18:19.402 --> 00:18:20.827
(laughter)

00:18:20.827 --> 00:18:23.874
MATT: Pull it out and blow on it?
ASHLEY: Let's just [inaudible] and start over.

00:18:23.874 --> 00:18:25.124
SAM: What happens?
ASHLEY: Better choices.

00:18:26.582 --> 00:18:27.572
LAURA: What happens?

00:18:27.572 --> 00:18:29.500
MATT: So natural 20.

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:31.750
He rolled a natural 20 to Counterspell yours.

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:32.583
Interesting.

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:36.696
TRAVIS: What is the ruling on it?

00:18:36.696 --> 00:18:38.045
LIAM: What's the protocol?

00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:40.403
MATT: So.

00:18:42.035 --> 00:18:43.190
TALIESIN: The Counterspell--

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:44.800
MATT: Order of operations here.

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:45.633
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:18:45.633 --> 00:18:47.440
MATT: As he steps down,

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.600
you attempt to cast a spell, and it dissipates.

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:50.860
He looks over.

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:53.390
You begin to make your incantation,

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:54.240
grabbing your friends,

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.690
begin to finish casting the spell

00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:58.170
as the energy begins to gather around

00:18:58.170 --> 00:18:59.880
and this green cloak of the Traveler begins

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:02.993
to swoosh around to grab all three of you,

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:05.750
and Trent, looking over at you as this is happening,

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:08.940
he goes, "Now, this is extremely rude.

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:11.470
"I'm just asking some questions.

00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:12.830
"This wasn't expected,"

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:13.780
and as he puts his hand up,

00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:15.570
you see this blur in the air,

00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:20.130
the striking spear of unraveling arcana

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:21.980
just jutting from his hand

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:23.610
that's reaching towards the spell

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:26.190
as you react and (whooshing) counter with your own.

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:28.310
As they both hit, it's like two waves

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:29.260
of similar energy hitting,

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:32.470
and then canceling out, nothing, absence.

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:35.220
Everything that he released fails,

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:38.310
and as the cloak begins to swirl around to grab both of you,

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:43.185
he goes "(clicks tongue) Good luck."

00:19:43.185 --> 00:19:44.510
LIAM: You taught me well.

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:49.284
MATT: Is the last thing you say before

00:19:49.284 --> 00:19:50.117
(whooshing)

00:19:50.117 --> 00:19:51.816
(relieved yelling)

00:19:51.816 --> 00:19:53.291
MARISHA: Oh shit!

00:19:55.389 --> 00:19:59.070
TRAVIS: Holy buttholes.

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:00.540
Holy shit.

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:02.400
Tell me you took a picture of that dice, homie.

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.580
LIAM: Yeah, I got to send it around.

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:04.413
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:06.509
LIAM: Oh my god.

00:20:06.509 --> 00:20:07.928
MARISHA: Feel like I've been doing calisthenics.

00:20:07.928 --> 00:20:09.410
LIAM: It was actually a three, guys.

00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:11.160
(laughter)

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:12.376
SAM: We've been lying about the dice rolls

00:20:12.376 --> 00:20:13.395
for, like, years.
MATT: That's wild.

00:20:13.395 --> 00:20:14.320
Yeah.

00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:15.970
TRAVIS: That's wild.

00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:17.640
MATT: Legitimately, on this dice,

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:20.067
rolled two 20s in a row,

00:20:20.067 --> 00:20:21.580
and then you rolled a 20.

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:22.988
That's fucking crazy.

00:20:22.988 --> 00:20:24.220
TRAVIS: Yeah, save it for the annals of history.

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:27.563
LIAM: Oh my god.

00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:30.546
I can feel the roots of my hair.

00:20:30.546 --> 00:20:31.391
(laughter)

00:20:31.391 --> 00:20:32.225
MARISHA: I was about to say,

00:20:32.225 --> 00:20:34.057
Laura, your hair looks very bed-tossed

00:20:34.057 --> 00:20:35.791
and amazing right now.

00:20:35.791 --> 00:20:37.064
LAURA: Yanking it.

00:20:37.064 --> 00:20:38.690
Oh my god.

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:40.860
SAM: Whoa.
TALIESIN: Oh man.

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:42.980
SAM: That butt-clenching combat was powered

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:43.813
by Dwarven Forge,

00:20:43.813 --> 00:20:44.985
by the way.
LAURA: We have to do Nicodranas.

00:20:44.985 --> 00:20:47.870
We're on the balcony of Veth's apartment.

00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:49.448
SAM: Oh, is that where he sent us?

00:20:49.448 --> 00:20:50.380
MATT: Well, we'll get to that.

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:51.213
LIAM: Yeah, we'll get to that.

00:20:51.213 --> 00:20:52.427
MATT: Because you're one half of the equation.

00:20:52.427 --> 00:20:55.580
LAURA: Yes. I just want to say,
the minute that we bamfed out,

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:58.610
the minute we landed, I want to send a Sending spell to them

00:20:58.610 --> 00:20:59.740
to let them know we bamfed.

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:01.307
But however that happens.

00:21:01.307 --> 00:21:03.060
MATT: But there's been a moment,

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:04.410
as this element has happened.

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:09.280
So while the three of you currently sit

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:11.810
in the edge of the forest, lost in the cloud,

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:13.670
you are on the top of the tower.

00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:15.280
What are you doing, Beauregard?

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:16.460
MARISHA: We technically entered the game

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:17.640
with me sliding down,

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:18.870
and I was by the trap door

00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:20.080
that Jester had painted.
MATT: That's correct,

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:20.970
you are right, you are right.

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:23.680
MARISHA: And I was looking in that direction,

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:28.680
prepping my sprint to dart towards the fog cloud.

00:21:30.182 --> 00:21:31.015
MATT: Okay.

00:21:31.015 --> 00:21:32.230
MARISHA: Do I see any guards?

00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:33.270
Are they pretty distracted?

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:36.240
Do I have a pretty good, straight B line before I?

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:37.090
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:38.073
MARISHA: Before I bounce?

00:21:39.532 --> 00:21:40.365
Whew.

00:21:41.827 --> 00:21:45.530
Oh my god, okay, 15 total.

00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:46.853
MATT: 15 total, okay.

00:21:48.290 --> 00:21:49.870
You can glance forward

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:53.270
and see amongst the dense forest floor in front of you,

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:55.870
there's a very localized fog cloud.

00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:58.370
You have a pretty clear idea of what's there.

00:21:58.370 --> 00:22:00.330
There is a fence in your way,

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:04.140
but it should be a simple attempt to leap over it.

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:07.860
You will likely, if you're sprinting,

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:08.990
will not be able to do it stealthily,

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:10.640
which means it may draw attention

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:13.420
depending on if they're still preoccupied

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:14.750
with the giant illusory dragon,

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:16.900
which is still roaring and clawing at the gate.

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:18.590
MARISHA: Which I'm sort of banking on.

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:22.230
MATT: So yeah, do you dart across?

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:25.378
MARISHA: I sprint, I haul ass.

00:22:25.378 --> 00:22:28.767
TRAVIS: It's 25 feet from the tower to the gate, right?

00:22:28.767 --> 00:22:30.070
MARISHA: It's not far.
TRAVIS: And another 25

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:30.903
from the gate to the trees.
TALIESIN: And we're watching,

00:22:30.903 --> 00:22:34.486
going to drop the second that she hits the wall.

00:22:34.486 --> 00:22:35.970
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:37.603
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: I'm going for it.

00:22:37.603 --> 00:22:38.469
TALIESIN: We're all together?

00:22:38.469 --> 00:22:40.080
MATT: You dart, you rush up at the side.

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:41.580
As you leap to try and make your way

00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:43.780
over the high iron fence,

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:45.390
go ahead and make an acrobatics check

00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:48.583
to see if you can manage to scale it without issue.

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:52.559
MARISHA: 22.

00:22:52.559 --> 00:22:54.010
MATT: 22, yeah.

00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:55.910
Utilizing foot plants against the sides

00:22:55.910 --> 00:22:57.700
of the somewhat rusted iron exterior,

00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:59.110
you can get just enough traction,

00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:01.620
using dope monk shit, just darting up the side,

00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:03.230
grabbing, and spin over the top

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:06.375
as you do this slow motion handstand over

00:23:06.375 --> 00:23:07.400
(whooshing)

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:10.766
looking the pointed tops of it.
MARISHA: Very long Lara Croft.

00:23:10.766 --> 00:23:11.730
MATT: Yeah.
MARISHA: Yes.

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:13.585
MATT: As I call them, poodle 'palers.

00:23:13.585 --> 00:23:15.205
The pointed tops of--

00:23:15.205 --> 00:23:16.038
TRAVIS: Is that what they're called?

00:23:16.038 --> 00:23:17.696
MATT: That's what my mom called them.

00:23:17.696 --> 00:23:19.230
(laughter)

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:20.410
It's fucked up.

00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:21.243
My mom's dark.

00:23:22.505 --> 00:23:23.338
TRAVIS: A little bit.

00:23:23.338 --> 00:23:24.190
MATT: (laughs)

00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:25.270
MARISHA: Your mom is dark.

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:26.133
MATT: She's dark.

00:23:26.133 --> 00:23:27.090
MARISHA: It's the best.
LIAM: I understand

00:23:27.090 --> 00:23:28.590
that half of your personality.

00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:31.500
MATT: Foomph, you land on the opposite side

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:32.940
and go rushing in towards the fog

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:34.870
just as you hear voices go,

00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:37.990
"Don't, it's an illusion, go, go!"

00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:40.957
And you can see probably about a dozen or so guards rushing

00:23:40.957 --> 00:23:41.810
towards the front of the building.

00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:42.990
One of them glances over,

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:45.130
and sees you land, and points,

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:46.490
and starts yelling as well,

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:49.010
but they're a good 50, 60 feet from you.

00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:50.020
TRAVIS: As soon as they see her drop

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:51.320
on our side of the fence,

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.643
I'll drop the Marine Layer.

00:23:53.643 --> 00:23:54.476
MARISHA: Caduceus!

00:23:54.476 --> 00:23:56.273
TRAVIS: With her running towards it.

00:23:56.273 --> 00:23:57.680
MARISHA: (grunts)

00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:58.763
TRAVIS: Do, do, do.

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:01.013
MATT: Okay.

00:24:02.141 --> 00:24:03.470
(whooshing)

00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:04.303
You vanish.

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:08.110
LIAM: (vomiting noises)

00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:10.280
(laughter)

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:11.500
TRAVIS: How many texts?

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:12.780
How many texts?

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:13.628
SAM: A lot of texts.

00:24:13.628 --> 00:24:14.736
TRAVIS: 137?

00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:17.500
LIAM: All week, all week, all week, all week, all week.

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.633
TALIESIN: Well, that went off without a hitch.

00:24:19.633 --> 00:24:20.466
That's exactly--

00:24:20.466 --> 00:24:22.130
We have no idea what happened in there,

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:24.670
but, from our end, perfection.

00:24:24.670 --> 00:24:25.789
TRAVIS: Well, we'll see.
ASHLEY: Yeah, we did pretty good.

00:24:25.789 --> 00:24:28.016
TRAVIS: We'll see.
TALIESIN: It was very solid.

00:24:28.016 --> 00:24:29.820
MARISHA: I super murdered a guy.

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:30.653
ASHLEY: You did?

00:24:30.653 --> 00:24:32.700
MARISHA: Yeah, it was like,

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:34.480
I don't know if I want to ever do that again.

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:35.520
TALIESIN: Kind of par for the course.

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:36.353
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:24:36.353 --> 00:24:39.030
ASHLEY: Sometimes, you need to do what,
you know, you have to do.

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:39.863
TALIESIN: Things happen.

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:42.380
MARISHA: Do we know if the others are here?

00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:45.053
LAURA: I'm going to send a message to Fjord.

00:24:47.195 --> 00:24:49.335
Get out of there, Fjord, Fjord,

00:24:49.335 --> 00:24:50.486
we're in Nicodranas.

00:24:50.486 --> 00:24:53.987
Tell Caduceus to send you to Nicodranas.

00:24:53.987 --> 00:24:55.440
TRAVIS: Oh shit, I just got a message

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.470
saying that they're in Nicodranas.

00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:59.140
They had to leave.

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:00.300
Are we in Nicodranas?

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:01.460
LIAM: I guess that's what you heard.

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:02.293
TALIESIN: We're at the lighthouse, right?

00:25:02.293 --> 00:25:03.126
MATT: Yep.

00:25:03.126 --> 00:25:05.280
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're fine.
LAURA: Yeah, that's all I got back.

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:06.867
LIAM: (as Travis) "I guess we're in Nicodranas."

00:25:06.867 --> 00:25:08.305
(laughter)

00:25:08.305 --> 00:25:09.760
I don't get sent a lot of messages,

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:11.048
I forgot you could reply.

00:25:11.048 --> 00:25:12.960
(laughter)

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.560
TALIESIN: I was actually really expecting the,

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:16.410
"Oh no, ah, ah!"

00:25:18.085 --> 00:25:19.860
MARISHA: When your mom thinks she's hung up the phone.

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:20.693
MATT: Right.

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:24.810
TRAVIS: There's no macaroni.
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:26.100
MATT: With the adrenaline still pumping

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:28.360
in your ears and your eyes,

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:31.963
you can have the immediate scent of fresh sea spray,

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.927
catches you, and you glance around,

00:25:34.927 --> 00:25:36.010
you can see the ocean splashing

00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:39.180
onto the rocks below as you're on the outside cusp

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:42.570
of the Wild Mother Lighthouse

00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:45.593
overlooking the harbor of Nicodranas.

00:25:46.872 --> 00:25:47.705
TALIESIN: (exhaling)

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:51.176
TRAVIS: Right.
TALIESIN: Well, that was a lot.

00:25:51.176 --> 00:25:53.560
TRAVIS: They made it out, so did we.

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:54.930
One, two, three, four.

00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:56.970
ASHLEY: Wait, were we all meeting here?

00:25:56.970 --> 00:25:58.317
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:25:58.317 --> 00:25:59.830
ASHLEY: And they left before us?

00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:02.490
TRAVIS: But I think they went somewhere else in Nicodranas.

00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:04.844
TALIESIN: Two different teleportations.

00:26:04.844 --> 00:26:06.070
We can't have the same one.

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:09.440
MARISHA: Isn't Jester's connected to the chateau?

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:10.490
Should we head there?

00:26:12.338 --> 00:26:15.897
TALIESIN: Oh, it's connected to,
yeah, Veth's house, if I recall.

00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:20.260
TRAVIS: Is there any way anyone could follow us from that?

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:21.170
TALIESIN: Yes.

00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:22.836
TRAVIS: Oh, really?
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

00:26:22.836 --> 00:26:25.320
We should probably get cloaked as quickly as possible,

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:26.690
so let's move.

00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:28.749
TRAVIS: Which means we have to find them, okay.

00:26:28.749 --> 00:26:29.978
Veth's place?

00:26:29.978 --> 00:26:30.842
Veth's, yes?

00:26:30.842 --> 00:26:31.750
MARISHA: Sure, Veth's.

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:32.583
LAURA: While that's happening,

00:26:32.583 --> 00:26:36.760
as soon as we land, and I send the message,

00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:41.160
I'm going to start digging out the necklaces from the room.

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:44.040
MATT: Right, so, as you three arrive,

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:47.060
which was marked inside Veth's Nicodranas abode.

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:48.180
LAURA: Yeah, up on the balcony.

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:49.840
MATT: Mm-hmm, so you're still on the balcony,

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:51.420
the warm air hits you,

00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:53.420
a nice little change from the colder region

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:55.723
on the northern side of the Dwendalian Empire,

00:26:56.770 --> 00:26:58.800
the tension still crisp,

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:01.410
and you can see Caleb on the verge

00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:03.260
of hyperventilating in the midst of that chaos.

00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:04.093
LIAM: Yep.

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:07.020
I see Jester rooting in the bag,

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:07.867
and I stop her for a second,

00:27:07.867 --> 00:27:11.730
and Caleb pulls them both into a very fierce hug,

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:12.563
and says:

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:14.870
I'm sorry.

00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:16.580
Thank you, I'm sorry.

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:18.170
SAM: No, no, no, no sorries.

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:20.340
I'm sorry that I got a little greedy at the end.

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:21.600
That was probably on me.

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.450
It was my fault. I shouldn't've--

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:24.677
LIAM: It was dangerous to go in there.

00:27:24.677 --> 00:27:28.010
MATT: Veth's voice, as she's talking to you,

00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:30.450
almost seems to echo and fade

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:32.880
as a voice fills your mind.

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:33.713
SAM: Oh.

00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:38.573
MATT: (as Trent) "Now, Bren, that was uncalled for.

00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:41.483
"Conversation.

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:45.961
"See, now I'm worried."

00:27:49.623 --> 00:27:50.456
LIAM: Is that the end of it?

00:27:50.456 --> 00:27:52.373
MATT: That's the end of it.

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:56.190
LIAM: You can sit and cool off.

00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:58.440
I don't know if I'm ready to talk to you yet.

00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:05.070
LAURA: Oh okay, well, we can go down.

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:06.380
If you want to be up on the balcony--

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:07.930
LIAM: Sorry.

00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:09.680
SAM: I'll just sit here then, I guess.

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:13.826
LIAM: He was talking to me, like you do.

00:28:13.826 --> 00:28:14.726
LAURA: Oh.

00:28:14.726 --> 00:28:16.400
LIAM: I think.

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:17.350
Let's get these on.

00:28:18.261 --> 00:28:19.180
LAURA: Veth, put it on.

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:21.712
SAM: What is? Oh, oh, whoa, we stole them.

00:28:21.712 --> 00:28:23.042
This is why we did it!

00:28:23.042 --> 00:28:24.043
Oh, yes!

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:26.074
You know, I don't really like it.

00:28:26.074 --> 00:28:27.532
It doesn't go with my--
LAURA: No, put it on!

00:28:27.532 --> 00:28:28.661
SAM: Well, I mean, it's just a little tacky.

00:28:28.661 --> 00:28:30.078
LAURA: Put it on.
SAM: All right, fine.

00:28:32.059 --> 00:28:32.950
MATT: All right.
LIAM: Yes.

00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:33.810
LAURA: How many did we get?

00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:35.780
How many are in the box?

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:37.713
MATT: Inside the box, there are 12.

00:28:37.713 --> 00:28:38.790
LAURA: Ooh!
TRAVIS: Oh.

00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:39.830
LAURA: That's great.

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:41.935
SAM: I can use them like earrings!

00:28:41.935 --> 00:28:43.900
LIAM: (exhales)

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:45.421
These stack.

00:28:45.421 --> 00:28:46.254
(laughter)

00:28:46.254 --> 00:28:48.395
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Double can't see me.

00:28:48.395 --> 00:28:51.800
MATT: But you do have to attune to them to be functional.

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:52.633
LIAM: Yeah, yeah.
SAM: Oh no.

00:28:52.633 --> 00:28:53.466
LAURA: You do?

00:28:53.466 --> 00:28:55.180
LIAM: Yes.
TRAVIS: Half hour.

00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:56.013
LIAM: Yep.

00:28:56.013 --> 00:28:57.579
MATT: So you have to take a short rest to attune,

00:28:57.579 --> 00:29:00.144
and you have to choose what you un-attune to have it on.

00:29:00.144 --> 00:29:01.230
SAM: Aw.

00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:03.544
LIAM: I'm un-attuning the Ring of Evasion. (fake sobbing)

00:29:03.544 --> 00:29:04.377
SAM: What?

00:29:04.377 --> 00:29:05.593
(grumbling)

00:29:05.593 --> 00:29:06.426
No!

00:29:06.426 --> 00:29:07.259
TRAVIS: Go for that ring,

00:29:07.259 --> 00:29:08.746
but think carefully.
SAM: I like everything that I have.

00:29:08.746 --> 00:29:09.796
LAURA: I'm not attuned to it.

00:29:09.796 --> 00:29:11.920
TRAVIS: Don't fucking say that.

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:12.890
LAURA: You're not even here.

00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:15.170
I'm talking to Fjord in my brain.

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:16.663
SAM: What is the item called?

00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:22.910
MATT: It's called Amulet of Protection
Against... Detection and--

00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:24.150
LIAM: Yeah, just search "amulet of."

00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:24.983
SAM: Got it.

00:29:26.737 --> 00:29:27.638
Got it.

00:29:27.638 --> 00:29:28.471
LIAM: Got it.

00:29:28.471 --> 00:29:29.304
TRAVIS: Amulet of Pooping.

00:29:29.304 --> 00:29:30.629
LIAM: We're on a mission from God.

00:29:30.629 --> 00:29:32.470
LAURA: Can you send--

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:33.856
Do you think they know to meet us here?

00:29:33.856 --> 00:29:35.613
Should we have them meet us at the Chateau?

00:29:37.757 --> 00:29:40.160
LIAM: I think they probably know here.

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:40.993
Your mother is famous.
LAURA: I wonder

00:29:40.993 --> 00:29:42.930
if he's scrying on us right now.

00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:45.760
Oh, what if he's scrying on us right now?

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:46.593
LIAM: Are you able to--

00:29:46.593 --> 00:29:48.360
LAURA: We should just get really close to Caleb.

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:49.450
Get really close to Caleb.

00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:52.856
LIAM: Are you able to talk to our friends anymore

00:29:52.856 --> 00:29:53.689
out of this house?
LAURA: Hold on, let me see

00:29:53.689 --> 00:29:55.528
how many spells I have left.

00:29:55.528 --> 00:29:56.710
LIAM: Maybe we should just leave.

00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:58.290
SAM: Can I just peek in the curtain?

00:29:58.290 --> 00:29:59.230
Is anyone home?

00:29:59.230 --> 00:30:00.670
Because we're on the balcony?

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:02.760
MATT: You are on the balcony, yes.

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:04.010
So you look inside.

00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:04.843
LAURA: It's a big balcony.

00:30:04.843 --> 00:30:06.710
MATT: From as brightly lit as the exterior is,

00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:08.560
the inside looks very dark by comparison,

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:10.753
even just having to adjust your eyes to it,

00:30:10.753 --> 00:30:13.410
but on the inside, you can see the furniture as you left it.

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:16.053
You don't currently see anybody moving on the inside.

00:30:16.063 --> 00:30:18.062
SAM: (grunts) It's locked.

00:30:18.062 --> 00:30:19.855
I'll try to pick my own lock.

00:30:19.855 --> 00:30:21.194
MATT: (laughs)

00:30:21.194 --> 00:30:24.774
Go ahead and roll. Use your thieves' tools.

00:30:24.774 --> 00:30:25.932
SAM: 21.

00:30:25.932 --> 00:30:26.807
MATT: Yeah.
SAM: (clicking)

00:30:27.784 --> 00:30:29.627
MATT: You go ahead and find your way in.

00:30:29.627 --> 00:30:30.468
(creaking)

00:30:30.468 --> 00:30:31.874
SAM: Check for traps.

00:30:31.874 --> 00:30:33.024
TRAVIS: You got to break into--
MATT: Go ahead and make

00:30:33.024 --> 00:30:34.350
an investigation check.

00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:35.683
TRAVIS: If you haven't broken into your own place,

00:30:35.683 --> 00:30:38.134
you're missing out.
SAM: Okay, yeah, 23.

00:30:38.134 --> 00:30:39.064
MATT: 23.

00:30:39.064 --> 00:30:41.342
It does not appear to be trapped.

00:30:41.342 --> 00:30:43.454
SAM: I've got to talk to Yeza about that, it's a risk.

00:30:43.454 --> 00:30:44.870
He should put traps.

00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:46.704
MATT: (laughs)

00:30:46.704 --> 00:30:47.654
But yeah, it does not appear

00:30:47.654 --> 00:30:49.257
that anybody's home at the moment.

00:30:51.634 --> 00:30:54.359
As you all step inside,

00:30:54.359 --> 00:30:55.567
Caleb, a voice

00:30:57.209 --> 00:31:00.046
of Trent once more finds its way into your mind.

00:31:04.044 --> 00:31:08.314
"If you wanted anything, all you had to do was ask.

00:31:09.864 --> 00:31:11.377
"This was unnecessary.

00:31:12.474 --> 00:31:16.490
"And now I have to explain this to the rest of the Assembly.

00:31:19.054 --> 00:31:20.654
"You don't know what you've done."

00:31:24.214 --> 00:31:27.117
LIAM: I am aware of the strings that are attached.

00:31:29.142 --> 00:31:30.742
Go off and tell your tales.

00:31:32.851 --> 00:31:33.708
(exhales)

00:31:33.708 --> 00:31:35.414
LAURA: Is he talking to you still?

00:31:35.414 --> 00:31:36.247
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

00:31:38.454 --> 00:31:40.094
LAURA: Is he using all of the 25 words?

00:31:40.094 --> 00:31:43.106
He's really wasting some spells there.

00:31:43.106 --> 00:31:45.350
LIAM: I think I've forgotten how to count

00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:46.817
and I have the Keen Mind feat.

00:31:46.817 --> 00:31:49.044
TRAVIS and LAURA: (laughing)

00:31:49.044 --> 00:31:51.414
LAURA: Do you want me to send him a message back?

00:31:51.414 --> 00:31:52.247
LIAM: No!

00:31:53.244 --> 00:31:54.534
No.

00:31:54.534 --> 00:31:57.414
I want this to start working.

00:31:57.414 --> 00:31:59.267
LAURA: Well, yours was already attuned.

00:32:00.137 --> 00:32:02.014
Yours is working just fine.

00:32:02.014 --> 00:32:03.944
Oh, your heart or your necklace?

00:32:03.944 --> 00:32:04.834
LIAM: Yes.

00:32:04.834 --> 00:32:06.604
It takes time, it takes time.

00:32:06.604 --> 00:32:07.924
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: To turn it back on.

00:32:07.924 --> 00:32:09.374
SAM: There wasn't much in the icebox,

00:32:09.374 --> 00:32:11.667
but there's some baby carrots and hummus.

00:32:11.667 --> 00:32:12.664
LAURA: Ooh!

00:32:12.664 --> 00:32:16.082
SAM: And Yeza had some warm Pabst.

00:32:17.854 --> 00:32:20.954
LIAM: I start to absentmindedly eat a baby carrot.

00:32:22.494 --> 00:32:23.834
LAURA: So, you guys.

00:32:24.835 --> 00:32:26.076
I, um--

00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:30.794
(laughter)

00:32:30.794 --> 00:32:31.760
LAURA: I didn't know we were going

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.600
to be murdering everyone in there.

00:32:35.214 --> 00:32:39.129
SAM: Yeah, I sort of felt badly about it as well.

00:32:39.129 --> 00:32:41.271
LAURA: I think things escalated very quickly.

00:32:42.374 --> 00:32:44.704
SAM: It wasn't just the killing, but we were

00:32:44.704 --> 00:32:48.084
really savage about it and crushing their bodies

00:32:48.084 --> 00:32:52.654
and sort of, you know, defiling them as we went.

00:32:52.654 --> 00:32:54.064
LAURA: Yeah.

00:32:54.064 --> 00:32:55.153
SAM: But they're bad people, right?

00:32:55.153 --> 00:32:56.859
LAURA: They're bad people, they did horrible things, Caleb.

00:32:56.859 --> 00:32:59.014
They deserve it, obviously.

00:32:59.014 --> 00:33:03.334
LIAM: I regret that we did not flesh out that step

00:33:03.334 --> 00:33:08.144
of our endeavor before we embarked, but I--

00:33:12.849 --> 00:33:14.397
There are bad people in that building.

00:33:15.334 --> 00:33:18.547
I was not about to risk your lives, taking too much time.

00:33:19.754 --> 00:33:22.344
The very thing I was afraid of happening did

00:33:23.884 --> 00:33:26.634
and I am shocked the three of us are standing here now.

00:33:27.874 --> 00:33:32.690
That said, I hope you and they can forgive me.

00:33:34.444 --> 00:33:36.034
SAM: Of course we can forgive you.

00:33:36.034 --> 00:33:38.384
It's just ourselves, you know?

00:33:38.384 --> 00:33:39.634
LAURA: Yeah.

00:33:39.634 --> 00:33:41.684
SAM: Do we even know if our friends are okay?

00:33:41.684 --> 00:33:43.214
Did they respond to the message?

00:33:43.214 --> 00:33:44.964
LAURA: I heard Fjord talking.

00:33:44.964 --> 00:33:46.544
I don't think he realized he could,

00:33:46.544 --> 00:33:48.574
but he was saying, "Oh, they made it.

00:33:48.574 --> 00:33:50.454
"We made it."

00:33:50.454 --> 00:33:51.597
SAM: He said we made it?

00:33:52.564 --> 00:33:53.884
Why would he say that to them?
LAURA: I think he asked if we were--

00:33:53.884 --> 00:33:55.444
SAM: Why would he say that out loud to his friends?

00:33:55.444 --> 00:33:57.454
LAURA: He said, "Are we in Nicodranas?"

00:33:57.454 --> 00:33:58.527
SAM: Oh, okay, okay.

00:33:58.527 --> 00:34:01.194
LIAM: But he didn't say where they were?

00:34:01.194 --> 00:34:02.027
LAURA: No.

00:34:03.254 --> 00:34:04.384
He didn't.

00:34:04.384 --> 00:34:06.531
SAM: Where is Caduceus'--

00:34:06.531 --> 00:34:08.394
LAURA: Caduceus' was over at the--

00:34:09.564 --> 00:34:11.204
How much should we say out loud?

00:34:11.204 --> 00:34:13.654
Because Trent could be scrying on us right now.

00:34:13.654 --> 00:34:14.594
LIAM: Let's just--

00:34:15.664 --> 00:34:16.694
Why don't we take a walk?

00:34:16.694 --> 00:34:18.194
LAURA: Spell it in baby carrots.

00:34:18.194 --> 00:34:19.638
Just sort of--

00:34:19.638 --> 00:34:21.796
LAURA: That's a long thing to--
LIAM: I think you can see baby carrots.

00:34:21.796 --> 00:34:23.784
SAM: Write it in the hummus.

00:34:23.784 --> 00:34:25.242
LAURA: He could still see that.

00:34:28.324 --> 00:34:30.134
LIAM: Yeah, I don't think baby carrots are immune

00:34:30.134 --> 00:34:31.334
to that spell.
LAURA: Oh, tell you what.

00:34:31.334 --> 00:34:32.687
You--

00:34:32.687 --> 00:34:33.747
No, that won't work.

00:34:33.747 --> 00:34:36.271
TALIESIN: Everyone knows you can only scry on adult carrots.

00:34:36.271 --> 00:34:37.364
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:34:37.364 --> 00:34:38.513
LAURA: I got nothing.

00:34:38.513 --> 00:34:40.019
We'll do it after we can talk--
LIAM: I cast Locate Carrots.

00:34:40.019 --> 00:34:41.534
LAURA: -- after, you know, an hour.

00:34:41.534 --> 00:34:44.274
After an hour, but oh my gosh!

00:34:44.274 --> 00:34:45.890
You should definitely tell your family

00:34:45.890 --> 00:34:47.574
not to come back here!

00:34:47.574 --> 00:34:49.340
SAM: How? I don't know where they are.

00:34:50.501 --> 00:34:53.304
LAURA: I'll send a message. (laughs)

00:34:53.304 --> 00:34:54.864
SAM: To them, but not our friends.

00:34:54.864 --> 00:34:55.963
But yeah, sure, go ahead.

00:34:55.963 --> 00:34:58.044
LAURA: I already sent a message to our friends.

00:34:58.044 --> 00:34:59.954
LIAM: Jester, today, how many more times can you do this?

00:34:59.954 --> 00:35:00.787
LAURA: Just one time.

00:35:00.787 --> 00:35:03.045
LIAM: Just one time?
SAM: Maybe, I mean--

00:35:04.574 --> 00:35:05.920
LAURA: Two times.
SAM: Okay, okay.

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:07.471
LAURA: But if things go to shit--
SAM: Then send, yes, please.

00:35:07.471 --> 00:35:08.484
LAURA: -- this is all my spells.

00:35:08.484 --> 00:35:09.594
SAM: No, no, no, if it's two times,

00:35:09.594 --> 00:35:11.234
then yes, please tell my family.

00:35:11.234 --> 00:35:12.274
LAURA: Okay.
LIAM: I feel like I'm reliving

00:35:12.274 --> 00:35:14.148
our first visit to this place.
LAURA: I'm going to send a message to Yeza.

00:35:14.148 --> 00:35:15.104
MATT: All right.

00:35:15.104 --> 00:35:16.924
LAURA: And say--
SAM: Yes.

00:35:16.924 --> 00:35:17.757
LAURA: Hey!

00:35:20.184 --> 00:35:23.584
You and the boy should not come home.

00:35:23.584 --> 00:35:25.107
I'm just letting him know!

00:35:29.234 --> 00:35:30.887
It's dangerous.

00:35:31.794 --> 00:35:33.814
TRAVIS: I'm not counting, sorry.
LAURA: I know.

00:35:33.814 --> 00:35:34.745
LIAM: Ooh, make this one long.

00:35:34.745 --> 00:35:35.979
Make this one real long.

00:35:37.974 --> 00:35:40.654
LAURA: Avoid it for a while, we'll contact you soon.

00:35:40.654 --> 00:35:42.664
Go to my momma.

00:35:42.664 --> 00:35:44.452
SAM: You're doing the spooky voice.

00:35:44.452 --> 00:35:47.152
You're scaring my husband.

00:35:47.152 --> 00:35:48.965
LAURA: I don't know why I did the spooky voice.
MATT: The first thing you hear is--

00:35:48.965 --> 00:35:51.484
MATT: (yelping)

00:35:51.484 --> 00:35:52.957
"Oh, hi.

00:35:54.964 --> 00:35:55.977
"We're in the market.

00:35:57.093 --> 00:35:58.504
"Do you guys want sandwiches?

00:35:58.504 --> 00:35:59.844
"Wait.

00:35:59.844 --> 00:36:02.007
"Not to go home?

00:36:02.847 --> 00:36:03.888
"What? I don't--

00:36:05.221 --> 00:36:06.092
"Oh no."

00:36:06.092 --> 00:36:08.634
And that's the last bit you hear.

00:36:08.634 --> 00:36:10.538
LAURA: I wonder if he heard to go to--

00:36:10.538 --> 00:36:11.371
Oh no.

00:36:11.371 --> 00:36:13.854
SAM: They're in the market, you said?

00:36:13.854 --> 00:36:15.724
LAURA: Well, I don't want to say it out loud!

00:36:15.724 --> 00:36:16.871
SAM: Oh, then you didn't tell me.

00:36:16.871 --> 00:36:17.704
LAURA: No.
SAM: Where are they?

00:36:17.704 --> 00:36:19.794
LAURA: They're shopping.

00:36:19.794 --> 00:36:21.769
SAM: Oh, at the market?

00:36:21.769 --> 00:36:22.602
LAURA: Yeah.

00:36:22.602 --> 00:36:23.435
SAM: Okay.

00:36:23.435 --> 00:36:26.594
(laughter)

00:36:26.594 --> 00:36:29.164
SAM: Well, I can go there and get them.

00:36:29.164 --> 00:36:30.239
LAURA: Wait an hour!

00:36:31.294 --> 00:36:33.210
SAM: Oh, because they can track our location?

00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:35.054
LAURA: Yes, they can see you.

00:36:35.054 --> 00:36:36.494
He can be watching us right now.

00:36:36.494 --> 00:36:39.944
Anything we say will give him a clue as to where we are.

00:36:39.944 --> 00:36:41.394
SAM: You mean, where we are...

00:36:43.204 --> 00:36:45.112
LAURA: In--
SAM: In Emon?

00:36:45.112 --> 00:36:47.254
LAURA: In Emon!
SAM: Where we are?

00:36:47.254 --> 00:36:49.264
LAURA: Over in Tal'Dorei.

00:36:49.264 --> 00:36:50.741
SAM: I love it here.
LAURA: Yup.

00:36:50.741 --> 00:36:52.790
SAM: Capital city.
LAURA: It sure is nice in this city.

00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:56.844
LIAM: Just a nice, temperate 68 degrees.

00:36:56.844 --> 00:36:57.677
SAM: Mm-hm.

00:36:57.677 --> 00:36:59.957
MATT: The rest of you, you were making your way towards--

00:36:59.957 --> 00:37:00.906
SAM: ♪ Making my way ♪

00:37:00.906 --> 00:37:01.739
ALL: ♪ Making my way ♪

00:37:01.739 --> 00:37:02.994
We were making our way towards Veth's.

00:37:02.994 --> 00:37:03.941
MATT: Yes.

00:37:03.941 --> 00:37:06.004
TALIESIN: Briskly.

00:37:06.004 --> 00:37:08.094
MATT: At a brisk pace with them in the process

00:37:08.094 --> 00:37:10.228
of trying to attune to these necklaces

00:37:10.228 --> 00:37:11.664
and then taking a breather from this,

00:37:11.664 --> 00:37:13.704
at around this time, you all begin to arrive

00:37:13.704 --> 00:37:16.687
at the exterior door of the chambers.

00:37:19.003 --> 00:37:21.387
ASHLEY: (knocking on wood)
LAURA: (gasps)

00:37:22.821 --> 00:37:25.214
Who is it?

00:37:25.214 --> 00:37:26.771
MARISHA: The Boogeyman? What?

00:37:26.771 --> 00:37:29.824
LAURA: Okay, good, it's them. Come in!

00:37:29.824 --> 00:37:31.455
SAM: Oh, you're okay!

00:37:31.455 --> 00:37:32.741
MARISHA and ASHLEY: You're okay.

00:37:32.741 --> 00:37:34.754
SAM: Did anyone die or get hurt?

00:37:34.754 --> 00:37:36.734
TRAVIS: No, we were just hanging out in the trees.

00:37:36.734 --> 00:37:37.846
I made a dragon.
LAURA: Necklace.

00:37:37.846 --> 00:37:39.487
Necklace for you, necklace for Yasha,

00:37:39.487 --> 00:37:40.695
necklace for you. Put it on,

00:37:40.695 --> 00:37:42.212
attune to it, let's sit here an hour,

00:37:42.212 --> 00:37:44.082
don't say anything about our location.

00:37:44.082 --> 00:37:45.084
LIAM: You have to meld with it,

00:37:45.084 --> 00:37:46.164
I'm sorry.
MARISHA: Oh man!

00:37:46.164 --> 00:37:47.524
TRAVIS: How many of these did you get?

00:37:47.524 --> 00:37:48.504
LAURA and SAM: So many.

00:37:48.504 --> 00:37:50.794
LAURA: You guys, Trent showed up.

00:37:50.794 --> 00:37:51.894
TRAVIS: What do you mean?

00:37:51.894 --> 00:37:53.284
<i>Trent</i> showed up?

00:37:53.284 --> 00:37:55.304
MARISHA: I saw him walking in.

00:37:55.304 --> 00:37:56.164
TALIESIN: Whoa.

00:37:56.164 --> 00:37:57.154
SAM: Why didn't you tell us?

00:37:57.154 --> 00:37:58.676
Oh, you don't have--
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:37:58.676 --> 00:38:00.425
SAM: -- Message, like me and Caleb and Yasha.
LAURA: You really should learn

00:38:00.425 --> 00:38:02.967
how to do that, Beau, it's super useful.

00:38:03.925 --> 00:38:05.964
ASHLEY: I can tell you how.

00:38:05.964 --> 00:38:06.797
MARISHA: Okay.

00:38:06.797 --> 00:38:09.647
ASHLEY: I think I can only do it with her, but--

00:38:09.647 --> 00:38:10.480
MARISHA: Anyway.

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:11.824
TRAVIS: So he showed up,

00:38:11.824 --> 00:38:13.944
because he was walking and then he disappeared,

00:38:13.944 --> 00:38:16.444
and we just thought he left.

00:38:16.444 --> 00:38:18.214
What happened?

00:38:18.214 --> 00:38:19.764
SAM: It was real touch and go.

00:38:19.764 --> 00:38:21.297
We got the items.

00:38:22.844 --> 00:38:23.884
LAURA: And also some other things.

00:38:23.884 --> 00:38:25.374
SAM: We got some other stuff.

00:38:25.374 --> 00:38:28.264
And then he showed up and was like--

00:38:28.264 --> 00:38:31.614
there was a little sorcerer-on-wizard-on-sorcerer battle.

00:38:31.614 --> 00:38:32.734
Is he a wizard or a sorcerer?

00:38:32.734 --> 00:38:34.454
I don't know, he's a wizard.
LIAM: He is one of

00:38:34.454 --> 00:38:36.054
the most powerful wizards on the continent.

00:38:36.054 --> 00:38:38.604
SAM: Wizard-on-wizard shit, it was crazy.

00:38:38.604 --> 00:38:40.444
And we almost died, but Jester got us

00:38:40.444 --> 00:38:41.664
out of there lickety-split.

00:38:41.664 --> 00:38:44.294
TRAVIS: Did he try to kill you?

00:38:44.294 --> 00:38:45.127
Eviscerate you?

00:38:45.127 --> 00:38:46.474
Tear you limb from limb?

00:38:46.474 --> 00:38:47.676
LIAM: No.
LAURA: More try to talk to us.

00:38:47.676 --> 00:38:48.509
SAM: He just talked.

00:38:48.509 --> 00:38:49.974
LIAM: Honestly, we were a little trigger-happy.

00:38:49.974 --> 00:38:53.822
I was a little trigger-happy for five minutes or so.

00:38:53.822 --> 00:38:55.574
ASHLEY: It's a stressful situation

00:38:55.574 --> 00:38:58.494
in a place that stresses you out and--

00:38:58.494 --> 00:39:00.094
TALIESIN: You going to be all right, Caleb?

00:39:01.084 --> 00:39:02.684
LIAM: Y-y-yes.

00:39:02.684 --> 00:39:05.874
SAM: There were some casualties on the excursion.

00:39:05.874 --> 00:39:06.804
TRAVIS: Casualties?

00:39:06.804 --> 00:39:08.114
LIAM: I killed a few people.

00:39:08.114 --> 00:39:09.844
SAM: We killed a few people.

00:39:09.844 --> 00:39:11.522
I did as well.

00:39:11.522 --> 00:39:14.980
LIAM: You might not have if I had not led the way.

00:39:17.144 --> 00:39:19.294
I take responsibility for it.

00:39:19.294 --> 00:39:20.153
SAM: It's okay.

00:39:20.153 --> 00:39:21.186
LAURA: They were bad people.
SAM: They were bad guys.

00:39:21.186 --> 00:39:22.255
LAURA and SAM: They were bad guys.

00:39:22.255 --> 00:39:25.092
We had to do what we had to do, for the betterment of--

00:39:26.874 --> 00:39:28.249
MARISHA: I mean, I sort of killed a guy, too,

00:39:28.249 --> 00:39:30.054
and I wasn't with you, so there's that.

00:39:30.054 --> 00:39:31.212
LAURA: Oh, you did?
TRAVIS: You killed a guy?

00:39:31.212 --> 00:39:33.074
MARISHA: Yeah, it was real brutal.

00:39:33.074 --> 00:39:34.554
TRAVIS: But you were up on the tower.

00:39:34.554 --> 00:39:35.644
Oh, someone was up there?

00:39:35.644 --> 00:39:38.170
MARISHA: Uh-huh and didn't see him.
TRAVIS: Did you give him the quick neck snap?

00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:39.003
MARISHA: Nope.

00:39:39.003 --> 00:39:40.224
LIAM: Beat me to it.
TRAVIS: Did you give him the old

00:39:40.224 --> 00:39:42.024
shove off the tower, quick death?

00:39:42.024 --> 00:39:42.948
MARISHA: Thought about it.

00:39:42.948 --> 00:39:45.269
SAM: A garrote around the--?

00:39:45.269 --> 00:39:47.191
MARISHA: I think I should buy one. Yeah.

00:39:47.191 --> 00:39:48.648
TRAVIS: Did you punch him in the solar plexus

00:39:48.648 --> 00:39:50.874
and cause his heart to explode?

00:39:50.874 --> 00:39:53.654
MARISHA: Oh fuck, I can do that and I didn't.

00:39:53.654 --> 00:39:54.934
No, I-- mm.

00:39:54.934 --> 00:39:56.421
TRAVIS: Which way did you go?

00:39:56.421 --> 00:39:58.121
MARISHA: You know those vials of acid

00:39:58.121 --> 00:39:59.629
you gave me a long time ago?

00:39:59.629 --> 00:40:01.129
SAM: Yeah, they're a low-grade acid, yeah.

00:40:01.129 --> 00:40:03.454
MARISHA: He was kind of--

00:40:03.454 --> 00:40:06.824
like an open-mouthed snorer, type of a thing,

00:40:06.824 --> 00:40:09.894
so I just-- (clicking)

00:40:09.894 --> 00:40:12.212
LAURA: You fed him the poisons?

00:40:12.212 --> 00:40:14.337
The slow acid?

00:40:14.337 --> 00:40:16.357
TRAVIS: In his mouth?
TALIESIN: Wow, I was really hoping that visual

00:40:16.357 --> 00:40:19.155
wasn't going to be true.
TRAVIS: You put the acid in his mouth?

00:40:19.155 --> 00:40:20.713
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: And then you snapped his neck

00:40:20.713 --> 00:40:22.246
to mercy kill him?

00:40:22.246 --> 00:40:24.420
MARISHA: I did after about 60 seconds

00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:26.964
because he wasn't dead yet.

00:40:26.964 --> 00:40:30.284
SAM: That acid is good for taking rust off of a blade

00:40:30.284 --> 00:40:32.434
after four or five days of soaking.

00:40:32.434 --> 00:40:35.677
TRAVIS: You poured CLR in his mouth and let him suffer?

00:40:35.677 --> 00:40:36.510
LAURA: Oh!

00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:38.434
MARISHA: Apparently good for killing guards, too.

00:40:39.287 --> 00:40:41.511
LIAM: I walk up to Beauregard and I'm not looking,

00:40:41.511 --> 00:40:43.604
I'm just thousand-yard staring at the ground,

00:40:43.604 --> 00:40:45.133
but I just sort of pat her on the shoulder.

00:40:45.133 --> 00:40:46.674
LAURA: (gasps)

00:40:46.674 --> 00:40:48.634
Oh my god, what if you two got

00:40:48.634 --> 00:40:50.897
real murder-happy because of your eyes?

00:40:52.484 --> 00:40:54.894
MARISHA: I didn't want to kill him, he just woke up

00:40:54.894 --> 00:40:56.894
and I didn't see him and he happened to be there.

00:40:56.894 --> 00:40:58.594
TRAVIS: He was sleeping?!

00:40:58.594 --> 00:41:00.854
MARISHA: I didn't kill him until he started to wake up

00:41:00.854 --> 00:41:02.956
and I felt the tower shake!

00:41:02.956 --> 00:41:05.392
It was the tower shaking that woke him up.

00:41:05.392 --> 00:41:07.034
TRAVIS: All right, all right, all right.

00:41:07.034 --> 00:41:08.204
Everybody made it out.

00:41:08.204 --> 00:41:09.037
LAURA: We made it.

00:41:09.037 --> 00:41:09.870
Everything's okay.

00:41:11.434 --> 00:41:12.304
We're going to get Trent.

00:41:12.304 --> 00:41:13.974
We'll go back, we'll get him.

00:41:13.974 --> 00:41:16.174
Just not now.

00:41:16.174 --> 00:41:18.524
MATT: About this time, a familiar voice

00:41:18.524 --> 00:41:21.074
creeps back into your mind.
SAM: Oh my god, this guy.

00:41:23.664 --> 00:41:27.997
MATT: "Traces of dunamancy left in his wake.

00:41:29.834 --> 00:41:33.101
"I have my theories on where you might have learned this."

00:41:37.728 --> 00:41:39.645
LIAM: Well, now we're both double-dealing.

00:41:43.221 --> 00:41:47.457
MATT: "Why do you run, as opposed to talk?

00:41:50.354 --> 00:41:54.057
"If you're worried about DeRogna, well,

00:41:57.294 --> 00:41:59.087
"she's not much of a worry anymore."

00:42:07.714 --> 00:42:10.174
LIAM: In every barrel of apples, there is one

00:42:10.174 --> 00:42:11.517
with a rotten worm in it.

00:42:14.124 --> 00:42:15.764
I am that worm.

00:42:15.764 --> 00:42:18.274
SAM: You guys, he's probably talking to Trent right now.

00:42:18.274 --> 00:42:20.491
ASHLEY: I was going to say.
MARISHA: He's talking to Trent?

00:42:20.491 --> 00:42:23.234
SAM: Yeah, he's been doing this all afternoon.

00:42:23.234 --> 00:42:25.087
TALIESIN: Maybe we need to go somewhere safe.

00:42:34.746 --> 00:42:35.996
SAM: What is that?

00:42:38.814 --> 00:42:39.847
LAURA: What did he say?

00:42:39.847 --> 00:42:41.744
LIAM: Caleb's not having a good time, guys.

00:42:41.744 --> 00:42:43.661
LAURA: What did he say?

00:42:47.133 --> 00:42:49.633
LIAM: I think he has implied--

00:42:54.874 --> 00:42:56.911
I'm a little worried for Essek.

00:42:58.236 --> 00:42:59.474
SAM: For Essek?

00:42:59.474 --> 00:43:00.467
LIAM: Yes.
SAM: How?

00:43:01.994 --> 00:43:05.397
I mean, Essek's half a world away.

00:43:06.884 --> 00:43:07.875
MARISHA: Do we need to go somewhere?

00:43:07.875 --> 00:43:08.916
SAM: Surrounded by troops.

00:43:08.916 --> 00:43:10.282
LIAM: I have--

00:43:12.844 --> 00:43:13.677
Essek--

00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:20.370
I have learned some of their magic

00:43:20.487 --> 00:43:21.328
in Kryn,

00:43:21.328 --> 00:43:25.954
and I have since reverse-engineered a little more of it

00:43:27.754 --> 00:43:31.754
and I may have used some

00:43:31.754 --> 00:43:33.079
in Vergesson.

00:43:35.370 --> 00:43:38.354
And now I think he has connected the dots.

00:43:38.354 --> 00:43:42.271
LAURA: He can tell what kind of magic you used?

00:43:46.831 --> 00:43:49.114
LIAM: He's the most dangerous man that I

00:43:51.504 --> 00:43:53.767
think exists in the Empire, Jester.

00:43:58.628 --> 00:44:00.194
LAURA: Why does the most powerful guy have to be

00:44:00.194 --> 00:44:02.194
such a shithead?

00:44:02.194 --> 00:44:04.367
Why can't he be a nice powerful guy?

00:44:04.367 --> 00:44:05.417
TRAVIS: Very good point.

00:44:08.349 --> 00:44:10.499
TALIESIN: Why bother being powerful if you're nice?

00:44:12.079 --> 00:44:13.884
LAURA: Think of all the people you could help.

00:44:13.884 --> 00:44:17.244
TRAVIS: I don't think I used See Invisibility today.

00:44:17.244 --> 00:44:18.634
Should I?

00:44:18.634 --> 00:44:19.467
LIAM: Yes.
LAURA: Yeah.

00:44:19.467 --> 00:44:21.064
MARISHA: Maybe while we attune to these?

00:44:21.064 --> 00:44:21.897
TRAVIS: Right.

00:44:21.897 --> 00:44:24.624
Do we want to be in the house where your husband

00:44:24.624 --> 00:44:25.994
and child live?
LIAM: No, we do not.

00:44:25.994 --> 00:44:29.984
TALIESIN: We had an alternative suggestion that we mimed.

00:44:29.984 --> 00:44:30.944
Did you get the mime

00:44:30.944 --> 00:44:32.351
that I was giving?
LAURA: I did, I got where you were miming.

00:44:32.351 --> 00:44:33.542
TALIESIN: I love miming.

00:44:33.542 --> 00:44:34.450
LAURA: Yeah.

00:44:34.450 --> 00:44:36.295
MARISHA: So where is it?

00:44:36.295 --> 00:44:37.274
TALIESIN: Well.
LAURA: Well, after we attune,

00:44:37.274 --> 00:44:39.471
so we'll sit here for another hour, that's the only thing.

00:44:39.471 --> 00:44:41.077
TALIESIN: Or do we go there and then attune?

00:44:42.294 --> 00:44:45.054
LIAM: I think somewhere remote or somewhere unimportant

00:44:45.054 --> 00:44:46.424
is a better place for us to go be

00:44:46.424 --> 00:44:48.024
right now.
TALIESIN: So if something happens

00:44:48.024 --> 00:44:50.144
and we're not here, we could be there,

00:44:50.144 --> 00:44:51.764
which would be a lot safer.

00:44:51.764 --> 00:44:52.597
LAURA: We should see if they're

00:44:52.597 --> 00:44:54.016
scrying on us right now, though.

00:44:54.016 --> 00:44:55.007
TRAVIS: Okay.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:44:55.007 --> 00:44:56.457
TRAVIS: I'll summon the sword.

00:44:57.337 --> 00:44:58.564
Have it pulse.

00:44:58.564 --> 00:45:00.266
Cast See Invisibility.

00:45:00.266 --> 00:45:01.565
LAURA: I guide you.
MATT: Make a perception check for me.

00:45:01.565 --> 00:45:03.846
LAURA: I'm going to guide him so that he can see better.

00:45:03.846 --> 00:45:04.679
TRAVIS: Thank you.

00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:10.864
Natural 20.

00:45:10.864 --> 00:45:11.973
(gasping)

00:45:11.973 --> 00:45:13.380
LIAM: ♪ Yeah! ♪

00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:14.630
MATT: Damn.
TALIESIN: You can see space and time.

00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:16.656
MARISHA: When is the other shoe going to drop?
LAURA: Hey, you guys remember the last game

00:45:16.656 --> 00:45:19.154
we had, where we all rolled really well

00:45:19.154 --> 00:45:21.364
for the first half, and then it turned to shit?

00:45:21.364 --> 00:45:22.624
MARISHA: Yes, I do.

00:45:22.624 --> 00:45:23.499
LAURA: Cool.
TALIESIN: Top load.

00:45:23.499 --> 00:45:24.507
MARISHA: That's kind of what I keep thinking about.

00:45:24.507 --> 00:45:27.104
TRAVIS: Plus three, plus two, so 25.

00:45:27.104 --> 00:45:28.514
MATT: 25.

00:45:28.514 --> 00:45:32.034
As you all sit there in the darkly lit interior

00:45:32.034 --> 00:45:35.004
of the Brenatto abode here in Nicodranas,

00:45:35.004 --> 00:45:39.194
you summon the sword, focus the magical energies

00:45:39.194 --> 00:45:41.564
from it to instill your vision and glance up

00:45:41.564 --> 00:45:43.474
right in the center of the room, to see there,

00:45:43.474 --> 00:45:45.854
looking straight down upon the space,

00:45:45.854 --> 00:45:50.724
a glowing arcane sphere, a node of vision

00:45:50.724 --> 00:45:53.222
from afar, locked into your location.

00:45:53.222 --> 00:45:54.372
LIAM: Balls.

00:45:54.372 --> 00:45:55.205
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:45:56.334 --> 00:45:58.274
TALIESIN: Let's do this.
TRAVIS: Right there.

00:45:58.274 --> 00:46:00.165
SAM: Man.
LAURA: I can dispel it.

00:46:02.033 --> 00:46:03.349
SAM: It'll just come back.
LIAM: I can dispel it.

00:46:03.349 --> 00:46:04.182
LAURA: Huh?

00:46:05.514 --> 00:46:07.084
SAM: It'll just come back again.

00:46:07.084 --> 00:46:08.334
Damn it.

00:46:08.334 --> 00:46:09.384
They know where they live.

00:46:09.384 --> 00:46:10.634
TALIESIN: Let's go where we're going to go.

00:46:10.634 --> 00:46:11.944
LAURA: They got to move.

00:46:11.944 --> 00:46:12.934
LIAM: I do dispel it.
SAM: He just closed

00:46:12.934 --> 00:46:13.814
on this place.

00:46:13.814 --> 00:46:14.647
LAURA: They got to move.

00:46:14.647 --> 00:46:17.310
SAM: They just, I mean--
LAURA: I know it's shit, but--

00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:19.209
SAM: It's been like a month and a half.

00:46:19.209 --> 00:46:20.628
MATT: What level?

00:46:20.628 --> 00:46:21.989
LIAM: 3rd.

00:46:21.989 --> 00:46:22.822
MATT: 3rd?

00:46:22.822 --> 00:46:26.137
Go ahead and roll a d20 and add your intelligence modifier.

00:46:26.137 --> 00:46:27.644
LAURA: What are you trying to do?
LIAM: Add what now?

00:46:27.644 --> 00:46:28.486
MATT: Your intelligence modifier.

00:46:28.486 --> 00:46:29.386
LIAM: Oh, okay, 15.

00:46:29.386 --> 00:46:30.277
MATT: 15's enough.

00:46:30.277 --> 00:46:31.861
LIAM: Okay.
TRAVIS: The pay stubs.

00:46:31.861 --> 00:46:33.606
MATT: As you're glancing up, Fjord,

00:46:33.606 --> 00:46:36.594
you watch as Caleb brushes his hand through the air

00:46:36.594 --> 00:46:39.324
and the orb dissipates and is gone.

00:46:39.324 --> 00:46:40.444
TRAVIS: Got it.

00:46:40.444 --> 00:46:43.762
TALIESIN: You know, while we're clear, tower?

00:46:44.696 --> 00:46:46.479
LAURA: Yeah, we can go to Yussa.

00:46:46.479 --> 00:46:48.764
TALIESIN: Right, right now.
SAM: Are you okay?

00:46:50.174 --> 00:46:51.674
Which part are you not okay with?

00:46:51.674 --> 00:46:53.684
The Trent talking to you part?

00:46:53.684 --> 00:46:55.194
Or the killing people part?

00:46:55.194 --> 00:46:58.287
Or the endangering Essek part?

00:46:58.287 --> 00:46:59.236
TRAVIS: That's a fair question.

00:46:59.236 --> 00:47:02.156
SAM: For the endangering my family part or--?

00:47:02.156 --> 00:47:04.944
TRAVIS: (cackles)

00:47:04.944 --> 00:47:05.854
SAM: Listen.

00:47:05.854 --> 00:47:08.584
Listen, bubby, come here, come here, bring it in.

00:47:08.584 --> 00:47:09.994
This was a win!

00:47:09.994 --> 00:47:13.204
We got the things that we need to save the fucking world!

00:47:13.204 --> 00:47:14.754
This is good!

00:47:14.754 --> 00:47:15.919
LAURA: Yeah.

00:47:15.919 --> 00:47:18.194
Essek is already on-board, you know?

00:47:18.194 --> 00:47:19.834
And he knew what he signed up for when

00:47:19.834 --> 00:47:22.251
he got involved in all of this.

00:47:22.251 --> 00:47:24.414
I can send him a message and tell him to be aware,

00:47:24.414 --> 00:47:28.257
but you're not responsible for that.

00:47:30.514 --> 00:47:32.414
We did what we went in there to do.

00:47:32.414 --> 00:47:35.904
LIAM: But I am responsible for your family.

00:47:39.695 --> 00:47:41.196
And yours.

00:47:41.196 --> 00:47:42.137
And you.

00:47:46.194 --> 00:47:47.386
And I worry

00:47:49.348 --> 00:47:54.281
that I am the very thing he told me I was.

00:47:56.204 --> 00:47:57.262
MARISHA: Not yet.

00:48:02.334 --> 00:48:03.167
Not yet.

00:48:04.114 --> 00:48:05.834
TRAVIS: And you did good.

00:48:05.834 --> 00:48:06.934
We got what we needed.

00:48:10.424 --> 00:48:12.924
LAURA: Those guys probably tortured a lot of people,

00:48:12.924 --> 00:48:14.367
you know what I mean?

00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:19.014
TRAVIS: They probably had kids. We should move.

00:48:19.014 --> 00:48:20.684
We really should get going.
TALIESIN: Can we process and move

00:48:20.684 --> 00:48:21.774
at the same time?
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

00:48:21.774 --> 00:48:24.438
TALIESIN: I think walking will help.
LIAM: Yeah, walk and talk.

00:48:24.438 --> 00:48:25.560
TALIESIN: Walk and process.

00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:26.393
LAURA: Yeah.

00:48:26.393 --> 00:48:27.604
LIAM: Oh, that doesn't rhyme as well, though.

00:48:27.604 --> 00:48:28.437
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:48:28.437 --> 00:48:29.494
LIAM: Let's talk.

00:48:29.494 --> 00:48:31.664
LAURA: And your perception stays up for an hour.

00:48:31.664 --> 00:48:34.173
Your See Invisibility.
TRAVIS: I will keep it up.

00:48:34.173 --> 00:48:35.406
If I need to roll another one.

00:48:35.406 --> 00:48:36.898
Yeah, for an hour, yeah.
MARISHA: Process and progress?

00:48:36.898 --> 00:48:38.109
LAURA: Do I have the-- let me see.

00:48:38.109 --> 00:48:38.942
Oh.

00:48:39.874 --> 00:48:44.314
TRAVIS: As we're leaving the premises,
does another orb reappear?

00:48:44.314 --> 00:48:46.402
MATT: You do not see another one appear.

00:48:46.402 --> 00:48:47.737
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:48:47.737 --> 00:48:48.570
So far, so good.

00:48:50.364 --> 00:48:52.944
MATT: All right, where are you off to?

00:48:52.944 --> 00:48:55.410
SAM: Are we just going to walk around for a while?
TALIESIN: No.

00:48:55.410 --> 00:48:56.394
LIAM: The beach?

00:48:56.394 --> 00:48:57.525
TALIESIN: Tower.

00:48:57.525 --> 00:48:58.853
LAURA: I mean, we could go to Yussa's tower.

00:48:58.853 --> 00:48:59.953
TALIESIN: Go to Yussa's tower,

00:48:59.953 --> 00:49:01.234
we'll be safe there.
MARISHA: Beach walk to the tower.

00:49:01.234 --> 00:49:02.794
That sounds nice.

00:49:02.794 --> 00:49:04.904
TALIESIN: Tower will be safe.

00:49:04.904 --> 00:49:07.094
SAM: I've got to go to the market at some point.

00:49:07.094 --> 00:49:09.974
LAURA: Although, Yussa might be real super pissed at us

00:49:11.834 --> 00:49:13.824
for bringing it there.
LIAM: Yeah.

00:49:13.824 --> 00:49:16.994
TALIESIN: Well, we've done a lot of,
honestly, sketchy things

00:49:16.994 --> 00:49:20.404
in the last day, but let's remind ourselves that

00:49:24.308 --> 00:49:25.824
it's worth getting a few people pissed off

00:49:25.824 --> 00:49:29.244
because there's something bad coming and we need to stop it.

00:49:29.244 --> 00:49:30.077
TRAVIS: I'm with you.
LIAM: We could do that,

00:49:30.077 --> 00:49:32.004
but I worry that bringing that to his doorstep

00:49:32.004 --> 00:49:35.107
might just end that relationship.

00:49:38.524 --> 00:49:40.014
LAURA: We could walk around the marketplace

00:49:40.014 --> 00:49:43.564
until we find your family, tell them not to go home.

00:49:43.564 --> 00:49:45.034
SAM: Yep.

00:49:45.034 --> 00:49:47.394
TRAVIS: Does our casual walking count as a short rest?

00:49:47.394 --> 00:49:48.599
MARISHA: Yeah. Does our--

00:49:48.599 --> 00:49:49.841
TRAVIS: Or do we need to sit and--

00:49:49.841 --> 00:49:52.944
MATT: No, a short rest is you have to sit,

00:49:52.944 --> 00:49:54.554
tend to your exhaustion,

00:49:54.554 --> 00:49:55.594
drink water.
TRAVIS: Beach.

00:49:55.594 --> 00:49:56.427
TALIESIN: Beach.
MATT: You know,

00:49:56.427 --> 00:49:59.134
it's generally a sitting circumstance.

00:49:59.134 --> 00:50:00.024
TALIESIN: Beach.
LAURA: I'll help look for

00:50:00.024 --> 00:50:01.219
your family in the market

00:50:01.219 --> 00:50:02.747
if you want.
MARISHA: De-stress and stroll.

00:50:02.747 --> 00:50:06.294
TALIESIN: (gasps) So good.
SAM: After or the same time?

00:50:06.294 --> 00:50:07.294
LAURA: Same time?

00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:09.073
TALIESIN: Yes.

00:50:09.073 --> 00:50:10.896
ASHLEY: Where do we tell them to go, though?

00:50:10.896 --> 00:50:11.762
If they can't--

00:50:11.762 --> 00:50:13.157
TRAVIS: Do we want to fight on a beach?

00:50:13.157 --> 00:50:14.612
LAURA: Tell them to go back to my mom's house?
TRAVIS: I really don't.

00:50:14.612 --> 00:50:16.041
TALIESIN: Beach is, at least we can see things

00:50:16.041 --> 00:50:17.415
coming from every direction.

00:50:17.415 --> 00:50:19.791
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's true.
LAURA: They'll probably--

00:50:19.791 --> 00:50:22.341
Oh god, it'll probably lead back to her eventually.

00:50:23.494 --> 00:50:25.884
I was talking about, (groans)

00:50:25.884 --> 00:50:27.984
I talked about the Ruby of the Sea!

00:50:27.984 --> 00:50:29.567
SAM: To whom? When?

00:50:30.834 --> 00:50:32.294
LAURA: To what's his name?

00:50:32.294 --> 00:50:33.632
SAM: Trent?
LAURA: No!

00:50:33.632 --> 00:50:34.773
SAM: Yussa?
TRAVIS: Joshua?

00:50:34.773 --> 00:50:36.064
Whatever his name was?
LAURA: The guy.

00:50:36.064 --> 00:50:37.046
The guy that I charmed.

00:50:37.046 --> 00:50:38.144
SAM: The guard that you were charming?

00:50:38.144 --> 00:50:40.484
You were telling him details of your personal life?

00:50:40.484 --> 00:50:42.044
LAURA: I don't know what I was, he just--

00:50:42.044 --> 00:50:44.194
he was looking at me with these puppy dog eyes

00:50:44.194 --> 00:50:45.704
and I just started talking.

00:50:45.704 --> 00:50:47.454
TRAVIS: He was looking at you with puppy dog eyes?

00:50:47.454 --> 00:50:49.924
LAURA: Oh my god, Fjord, he loved me so much.

00:50:49.924 --> 00:50:51.754
LIAM: Okay, so maybe we need to give

00:50:51.754 --> 00:50:54.350
three of these medallions to your mother and your family.

00:50:54.350 --> 00:50:55.408
SAM: Sure, that's three.
MARISHA: I mean, to be fair,

00:50:55.408 --> 00:50:57.764
everyone knows our connection to Nicodranas,

00:50:57.764 --> 00:50:59.444
they already know our connection.

00:50:59.444 --> 00:51:01.344
Anyone who would want to hurt us already knows

00:51:01.344 --> 00:51:03.384
your mother is Marion.
LAURA: That's true, that's true,

00:51:03.384 --> 00:51:05.814
that's true, Trent already knows all those things.

00:51:05.814 --> 00:51:07.764
LIAM: But maybe they need to take a vacation right now,

00:51:07.764 --> 00:51:10.721
with these medallions.
LAURA: Oh my god, my mom.

00:51:10.721 --> 00:51:12.484
(gasping)
MARISHA: Vacation could be good.

00:51:12.484 --> 00:51:14.594
LIAM: Yeah.
LAURA: Oh my god, my mom.

00:51:14.594 --> 00:51:15.427
SAM: What?

00:51:15.427 --> 00:51:16.921
LAURA: I know where we can send her!

00:51:16.921 --> 00:51:19.138
SAM: (gasps) To The Gentleman?

00:51:20.834 --> 00:51:21.819
Parent Trap?

00:51:21.819 --> 00:51:22.652
LAURA: Yeah!

00:51:22.652 --> 00:51:24.184
SAM: Sorry, guys, you have to stay

00:51:24.184 --> 00:51:25.854
together for your own safety!

00:51:25.854 --> 00:51:27.664
TALIESIN: I feel like we've done enough damage today.

00:51:27.664 --> 00:51:32.244
(laughter)

00:51:32.244 --> 00:51:33.304
LAURA: Perfect.

00:51:33.304 --> 00:51:35.964
LIAM: Well, I'm kind of into it, but that's Liam.

00:51:35.964 --> 00:51:39.497
TRAVIS: What if she asks why she has to leave?

00:51:39.497 --> 00:51:40.514
LAURA: We have to tell her.
SAM: Tell her she's in danger

00:51:40.514 --> 00:51:41.614
because of us, I mean.

00:51:41.614 --> 00:51:42.884
TALIESIN: Yeah, the truth.

00:51:42.884 --> 00:51:44.428
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:51:44.428 --> 00:51:45.936
LIAM: And then, if we

00:51:45.936 --> 00:51:50.134
f-f-fail in our pursuits, it won't matter anyway.

00:51:50.134 --> 00:51:50.967
For anyone.

00:51:55.858 --> 00:51:57.614
TRAVIS: Well.

00:51:57.614 --> 00:52:00.284
MARISHA: So, how many of these medallions we have?

00:52:00.284 --> 00:52:01.117
LAURA: 12.

00:52:02.384 --> 00:52:03.407
MARISHA: Eight for us.

00:52:04.404 --> 00:52:05.974
One for your mom.
LAURA: One for Essek.

00:52:05.974 --> 00:52:06.807
LIAM: One for Essek.
SAM: Eight for us?

00:52:06.807 --> 00:52:08.554
MARISHA: Sorry, seven for us.

00:52:08.554 --> 00:52:09.951
LIAM: Well, there's nine of us.

00:52:09.951 --> 00:52:11.734
LAURA: (laughs)

00:52:11.734 --> 00:52:12.567
MARISHA: How many?

00:52:12.567 --> 00:52:13.734
How many?

00:52:13.734 --> 00:52:16.344
SAM: We need seven at least, we should keep a couple handy.

00:52:16.344 --> 00:52:18.381
TALIESIN: If we have a few, we can
bring more people with us.

00:52:18.381 --> 00:52:20.256
MARISHA: Exactly.
SAM: We can give one to,

00:52:20.256 --> 00:52:21.727
I mean, your mom,

00:52:21.727 --> 00:52:23.524
my husband, maybe my son if--

00:52:23.524 --> 00:52:24.357
LIAM: Yes, your son.

00:52:24.357 --> 00:52:26.404
Those three for sure, then we have two spares.

00:52:26.404 --> 00:52:29.124
One for Essek, one for miscellaneous.

00:52:29.124 --> 00:52:30.304
LAURA: Okay.

00:52:30.304 --> 00:52:32.344
TRAVIS: Just on the off-chance that we don't get the chance

00:52:32.344 --> 00:52:33.994
to short rest, are we sure we want the beach?

00:52:33.994 --> 00:52:35.014
I know we talked about it,

00:52:35.014 --> 00:52:38.294
but line of sight is so key in a fight.

00:52:38.294 --> 00:52:40.004
TALIESIN: What is better than line of sight

00:52:40.004 --> 00:52:41.694
than a beach?
TRAVIS: Something with walls.

00:52:41.694 --> 00:52:43.064
SAM: We don't even need seven of them,

00:52:43.064 --> 00:52:44.257
we only need six.

00:52:45.994 --> 00:52:47.164
We already have one.
LIAM: Oh, yeah, because we had one.

00:52:47.164 --> 00:52:48.283
Yeah, so three extra.

00:52:48.283 --> 00:52:49.216
MARISHA: That's true, that's true.
TALIESIN: Best just to have

00:52:49.216 --> 00:52:50.057
a few extra, though.

00:52:50.057 --> 00:52:51.854
That means more people we can bring with us.

00:52:51.854 --> 00:52:53.184
SAM: Sure.

00:52:53.184 --> 00:52:55.014
ASHLEY: Wait, there's 12 total?
SAM: Dagen.

00:52:55.014 --> 00:52:56.204
LAURA: Mm-hmm.
ASHLEY: Plus, we have six.

00:52:56.204 --> 00:52:59.214
LIAM: Now 13, including the one that Caleb originally

00:52:59.214 --> 00:53:01.214
has had since the start of the campaign.

00:53:02.224 --> 00:53:04.240
SAM: Okay, so we're going to the beach?

00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:05.131
TRAVIS: Do we want to go to the beach?

00:53:05.131 --> 00:53:07.094
Do we want to have something that has some cover?

00:53:07.094 --> 00:53:07.927
TALIESIN: Do you have an idea?

00:53:07.927 --> 00:53:10.874
MARISHA: There's the cliffs with the woods.

00:53:10.874 --> 00:53:11.974
We could do the cliff side.

00:53:11.974 --> 00:53:12.807
TALIESIN: Cliffs is just an

00:53:12.807 --> 00:53:14.394
opportunity to fall off.
LAURA: Water on one side.

00:53:14.394 --> 00:53:15.604
Cliffs on another.

00:53:15.604 --> 00:53:16.724
MARISHA: I don't think they're going to jump us

00:53:16.724 --> 00:53:17.557
on the beach, you guys.

00:53:17.557 --> 00:53:18.695
SAM: Who's they?
LIAM: We could find

00:53:18.695 --> 00:53:20.732
a Zuma Beach situation.
SAM: They're 1000 miles away.

00:53:20.732 --> 00:53:24.294
TALIESIN: So were we, an hour ago.
LAURA: He can teleport, just like we can.

00:53:24.294 --> 00:53:26.404
TALIESIN: And they have that ability.

00:53:26.404 --> 00:53:28.028
SAM: Not all of them.

00:53:28.028 --> 00:53:29.977
LAURA: But he can, and he can bring

00:53:29.977 --> 00:53:31.310
how many people?

00:53:32.994 --> 00:53:35.984
MARISHA: I say we go to the beach,
put our back to the water.

00:53:35.984 --> 00:53:36.817
SAM: Okay.

00:53:38.584 --> 00:53:39.784
You don't like it, Fjord?

00:53:39.784 --> 00:53:41.264
TRAVIS: I wouldn't put the President on the beach

00:53:41.264 --> 00:53:42.224
with his back to the water.

00:53:42.224 --> 00:53:43.204
SAM: Who's the President?
TRAVIS: Put him in a building

00:53:43.204 --> 00:53:44.504
with walls.
SAM: Are you just scared

00:53:44.504 --> 00:53:46.234
of getting close to Uk'otoa?

00:53:46.234 --> 00:53:47.394
TRAVIS: Well, these are wizards, right?

00:53:47.394 --> 00:53:48.574
Line of sight.

00:53:48.574 --> 00:53:51.484
MARISHA: But they just came from
a basement with a bunch of walls.

00:53:51.484 --> 00:53:52.317
If they teleported there,

00:53:52.317 --> 00:53:53.504
that would suck.
SAM: My god, we can't even decide

00:53:53.504 --> 00:53:55.034
where to sit for an hour.

00:53:55.034 --> 00:53:56.494
LIAM: Honestly, I think maybe--
SAM: We suck at this.

00:53:56.494 --> 00:53:57.334
LIAM: The reverse might be true,

00:53:57.334 --> 00:53:59.454
Fjord, because if we can see in all directions,

00:53:59.454 --> 00:54:01.097
at least we can see something coming.

00:54:01.097 --> 00:54:01.930
TRAVIS: Okay.
LIAM: These people that we're

00:54:01.930 --> 00:54:04.044
dealing with can just show up next to you.

00:54:04.044 --> 00:54:05.294
TRAVIS: It's true.

00:54:05.294 --> 00:54:06.534
TALIESIN: Room to scatter.

00:54:06.534 --> 00:54:07.367
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:54:08.404 --> 00:54:10.404
LIAM: I need to feel the sand under my feet.

00:54:11.423 --> 00:54:12.794
SAM: (whispering) Uk'otoa.

00:54:12.794 --> 00:54:13.921
MARISHA: To the beach!

00:54:13.921 --> 00:54:14.844
SAM: To the beach!

00:54:14.844 --> 00:54:17.094
MATT: All right, so you're
heading to the shore side beaches.

00:54:17.094 --> 00:54:18.764
MARISHA: Ooh, can we pick up some of those,

00:54:18.764 --> 00:54:22.824
some cocktails along the way, some of those coconuts?

00:54:22.824 --> 00:54:24.294
I'm sure there's got to be a kiosk, right?

00:54:24.294 --> 00:54:26.426
LIAM: It's time for a pub crawl!

00:54:26.426 --> 00:54:28.324
MARISHA: Just while we're walking!

00:54:28.324 --> 00:54:30.054
MATT: With the right questions asked

00:54:30.054 --> 00:54:31.674
and enough money paid, you know,

00:54:31.674 --> 00:54:36.644
I'd say for about five silver a pop,

00:54:36.644 --> 00:54:39.614
you can ask any of the nearby tavern keeps to try

00:54:39.614 --> 00:54:40.834
and put together some sort--
MARISHA: Do it to-go?

00:54:40.834 --> 00:54:42.864
MATT: -- of a drink for you like that, yeah.

00:54:42.864 --> 00:54:44.564
MARISHA: Yeah, I order a little to-go round.

00:54:44.564 --> 00:54:45.464
MATT: Okay, there you go.

00:54:45.464 --> 00:54:47.484
MARISHA: Just while we're walking, to unwind.

00:54:47.484 --> 00:54:48.734
It's important.

00:54:51.094 --> 00:54:51.927
MATT: All righty.

00:54:53.074 --> 00:54:55.427
SAM: Do we pass the market walking there or no?

00:54:56.894 --> 00:54:59.264
MATT: The market would probably be on the western side.

00:54:59.264 --> 00:55:01.534
It's a little bit out of the way from a direct line,

00:55:01.534 --> 00:55:03.603
but you can go ahead and pass through if you'd like.

00:55:03.603 --> 00:55:05.810
LAURA: You can try sending a message
if it's within 100 feet.

00:55:05.810 --> 00:55:09.006
TALIESIN: Can you hold a concentration spell
through a short rest or no?

00:55:09.006 --> 00:55:11.493
MATT: Only if it has a duration longer than an hour.

00:55:11.493 --> 00:55:13.109
TALIESIN: But at the end of that hour, it's okay.

00:55:13.109 --> 00:55:17.834
I can take a short rest while concentrating on a spell?

00:55:17.834 --> 00:55:18.814
MATT: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:55:18.814 --> 00:55:22.284
MATT: If the spell has an hour duration,

00:55:22.284 --> 00:55:24.054
it'll last for as long as the short rest is.

00:55:24.054 --> 00:55:24.887
TALIESIN: Perfect.

00:55:27.284 --> 00:55:30.764
SAM: Do I see my family in the marketplace?

00:55:30.764 --> 00:55:32.124
MATT: Okay, make a perception check.

00:55:32.124 --> 00:55:33.484
SAM: Oh, I'm good at this.

00:55:33.484 --> 00:55:34.317
Are you with me?

00:55:34.317 --> 00:55:35.954
LIAM: I'm going to assist.
LAURA: Guidance.

00:55:35.954 --> 00:55:37.746
MATT: Okay.

00:55:37.746 --> 00:55:39.961
TRAVIS: "Do I see my family?" (spell casting)

00:55:39.961 --> 00:55:41.657
SAM: Ooh, I think that's good.

00:55:41.657 --> 00:55:42.542
Guidance is another four?

00:55:42.542 --> 00:55:44.262
TRAVIS: Buff, buff, buff! (laughs)
SAM: Ooh!

00:55:44.262 --> 00:55:45.414
22!

00:55:45.414 --> 00:55:47.114
MATT: Nice!

00:55:47.114 --> 00:55:50.654
You see by one of the exterior fountains,

00:55:50.654 --> 00:55:53.654
underneath this shaded archway,

00:55:53.654 --> 00:55:56.661
flowers and a little bit of ivy on the edges of it,

00:55:56.661 --> 00:55:58.844
and you've been to this fountain before in the marketplace,

00:55:58.844 --> 00:56:00.724
it's a beautiful, little central area.

00:56:00.724 --> 00:56:03.484
On the side, you can see a little boy with a little boat,

00:56:03.484 --> 00:56:04.494
floating in the water,

00:56:04.494 --> 00:56:06.124
and he's tugging on it on a string and you see him,

00:56:06.124 --> 00:56:07.724
he is wearing a big hat,

00:56:08.894 --> 00:56:10.194
a hat that you've never seen him wear before,

00:56:10.194 --> 00:56:13.131
but looking at the physical behavior,

00:56:13.131 --> 00:56:14.264
you can already tell that it's Luc.

00:56:14.264 --> 00:56:16.864
And about three feet from it, you can see another man

00:56:16.864 --> 00:56:18.674
that looks about Yeza's build, comes up

00:56:18.674 --> 00:56:21.064
and just starts talking to him

00:56:21.064 --> 00:56:23.394
and ushering him away from the fountain.

00:56:23.394 --> 00:56:25.374
SAM: Okay, so without getting too close,

00:56:25.374 --> 00:56:29.245
I will send a message to Yeza.

00:56:29.245 --> 00:56:30.094
Yeza!

00:56:30.944 --> 00:56:32.374
It's me, I can see you.

00:56:32.374 --> 00:56:33.714
I'm glad you're okay.

00:56:33.714 --> 00:56:34.874
MATT: He stands up straight.

00:56:34.874 --> 00:56:37.937
SAM: Turn. Behind you, like five o'clock.

00:56:40.236 --> 00:56:41.069
MATT: (panting)

00:56:41.069 --> 00:56:43.394
SAM: But don't look at me!
MATT: "Oh."

00:56:43.394 --> 00:56:45.328
SAM: New spell.

00:56:45.328 --> 00:56:46.228
MATT: "Can I talk back?

00:56:47.076 --> 00:56:49.414
"Like the other one?"
SAM: You can reply to this message, yes.

00:56:49.414 --> 00:56:50.247
New spell.

00:56:51.324 --> 00:56:55.234
All right, so you can't go home, it's been compromised.

00:56:55.234 --> 00:56:56.214
MATT: "Oh."

00:56:56.214 --> 00:56:57.324
SAM: And I can't tell you where to go,

00:56:57.324 --> 00:56:59.124
in case they're watching.

00:56:59.124 --> 00:57:00.684
New spell.

00:57:00.684 --> 00:57:04.977
You go to the place where Bluud works.

00:57:05.871 --> 00:57:09.012
MATT: "The big, furry, horned guy?"

00:57:10.324 --> 00:57:11.864
SAM: Yes. (laughs)

00:57:11.864 --> 00:57:14.054
You can reply to this message.

00:57:14.054 --> 00:57:15.354
MATT: "Okay.

00:57:15.354 --> 00:57:18.604
"I'll go ahead and gather up Luc and we'll head there.

00:57:18.604 --> 00:57:19.594
"Everything all right?"

00:57:19.594 --> 00:57:20.904
SAM: Everything's fine.

00:57:20.904 --> 00:57:23.634
Just the house, we might have to move.

00:57:23.634 --> 00:57:25.305
Don't look at me!

00:57:25.305 --> 00:57:28.424
(laughter)

00:57:28.424 --> 00:57:29.424
It's too suspicious.

00:57:32.124 --> 00:57:33.784
Also, you need to restock the icebox,

00:57:33.784 --> 00:57:35.064
but we're going to burn the house anyway.

00:57:35.064 --> 00:57:37.217
Doesn't matter, just go to Bluud's.

00:57:37.217 --> 00:57:39.644
(laughter)

00:57:39.644 --> 00:57:42.439
MATT: "One thing at a time, I'll go to Bluud's.

00:57:42.439 --> 00:57:43.804
"Are we going to meet you there?"

00:57:43.804 --> 00:57:46.914
SAM: I will meet you there when
it's safe, which will be today.

00:57:46.914 --> 00:57:47.964
Very shortly.

00:57:47.964 --> 00:57:48.797
MATT: "Okay."

00:57:49.674 --> 00:57:50.507
SAM: Oh!

00:57:51.804 --> 00:57:52.637
I love you.

00:57:53.798 --> 00:57:54.815
MATT: "I love you, too."

00:57:57.140 --> 00:58:01.234
And he goes ahead and grabs Luc and picks up his stuff.

00:58:01.234 --> 00:58:03.294
Doesn't point you out, because he knows that chaos

00:58:03.294 --> 00:58:04.884
will ensue, and he starts talking to Luc

00:58:04.884 --> 00:58:06.104
and takes his hand and they both

00:58:06.104 --> 00:58:08.644
begin circling a wide arc out of the middle

00:58:08.644 --> 00:58:10.944
of this side of the marketplace.

00:58:10.944 --> 00:58:12.657
TRAVIS: Any orbs circling above?

00:58:14.068 --> 00:58:15.844
MATT: At this point, make a perception check.

00:58:15.844 --> 00:58:18.494
You're towards the very end of its duration, I'd say.

00:58:20.482 --> 00:58:23.099
LAURA: If you tell me you're looking, I can help you.

00:58:25.129 --> 00:58:27.324
TRAVIS: 19, 20 total.
MATT: 20, nice.

00:58:27.324 --> 00:58:28.607
You don't see anything.

00:58:30.224 --> 00:58:31.549
TRAVIS: Clear.
LAURA: Okay.

00:58:32.516 --> 00:58:33.349
SAM: Okay.

00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:34.264
MATT: And now you head to the beach?

00:58:34.264 --> 00:58:35.097
LAURA: Yeah.

00:58:35.097 --> 00:58:36.684
MATT: Now, how far outside of town are you going to?

00:58:36.684 --> 00:58:37.517
Are you just going to the beach

00:58:37.517 --> 00:58:38.932
at the south side of Nicodranas?

00:58:38.932 --> 00:58:41.614
There's some areas that aren't directly

00:58:41.614 --> 00:58:44.694
on the dockside landscape that are a open beach,

00:58:44.694 --> 00:58:47.594
but they're a little bit out of the city and to the south.

00:58:48.744 --> 00:58:50.824
Is that where you're heading?

00:58:50.824 --> 00:58:52.576
LAURA: How long of a walk is that?

00:58:52.576 --> 00:58:53.934
MATT: From where you are in the marketplace,

00:58:53.934 --> 00:58:55.712
about 20 minutes or so.

00:58:55.712 --> 00:58:57.144
LAURA: Yeah?

00:58:57.144 --> 00:58:58.274
Yeah.

00:58:58.274 --> 00:58:59.107
MATT: Okay.

00:58:59.107 --> 00:59:01.294
LAURA: If there's a nice, little location

00:59:01.294 --> 00:59:03.674
that's up against the cliffs, you know.

00:59:05.250 --> 00:59:06.083
That's got--

00:59:06.083 --> 00:59:08.296
MATT: Okay. 25, 30 minutes.
LAURA: Okay.

00:59:09.264 --> 00:59:10.594
MATT: But you all eventually make your way

00:59:10.594 --> 00:59:14.914
to the sandy edge of the shore in this space.

00:59:14.914 --> 00:59:17.174
You can see these heavier rocks,

00:59:17.174 --> 00:59:21.814
familiar as to where a previous meditation was taken

00:59:21.814 --> 00:59:23.917
not but a year or more before.

00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:27.146
You can hear the waves crashing.

00:59:27.146 --> 00:59:29.835
(waves crashing)

00:59:29.835 --> 00:59:30.801
TRAVIS: Pretty good.

00:59:30.801 --> 00:59:34.344
MATT: Wind blows in a nice breeze, good temperature.

00:59:34.344 --> 00:59:38.444
A welcome disparity between the location to the north,

00:59:38.444 --> 00:59:41.197
where you had previously been and plan to return.

00:59:42.314 --> 00:59:45.334
But it's just you and one beachcomber,

00:59:45.334 --> 00:59:49.114
this older fellow with deeply tanned, leathered skin,

00:59:49.114 --> 00:59:51.404
walking by in faint clothing.

00:59:51.404 --> 00:59:52.894
It looks like he's poking through with a stick

00:59:52.894 --> 00:59:54.154
and he has a little bag on his side

00:59:54.154 --> 00:59:55.524
and he's just picking up

00:59:55.524 --> 00:59:57.114
bits of things that have washed up on the shore

00:59:57.114 --> 00:59:58.944
and looking them over and putting them in the bag,

00:59:58.944 --> 01:00:00.855
and he looks over at the rest of you.

01:00:00.855 --> 01:00:02.001
"Hey."

01:00:03.714 --> 01:00:04.904
SAM: Metal detector guy?

01:00:04.904 --> 01:00:07.216
MATT: Keeps walking, yep.

01:00:07.216 --> 01:00:08.366
TRAVIS: Kill him!

01:00:08.366 --> 01:00:09.391
MATT: (laughs) Roll initiative.

01:00:09.391 --> 01:00:13.141
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a minute to--
LIAM: I'll do it, too.

01:00:13.141 --> 01:00:14.344
TALIESIN: Are we staying here?

01:00:14.344 --> 01:00:15.424
SAM: Yes, this is our short rest.

01:00:15.424 --> 01:00:17.974
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a minute and Conjure Celestial.

01:00:19.214 --> 01:00:20.872
MATT: Okay?
TRAVIS AND LIAM: Oh?

01:00:20.872 --> 01:00:23.036
SAM: Aroo?

01:00:23.036 --> 01:00:24.358
LIAM: (mimics Scooby-Doo)

01:00:26.142 --> 01:00:28.133
TALIESIN: A couatl, is that what they're called?

01:00:29.151 --> 01:00:30.109
TRAVIS: Quetzalcoatl?

01:00:30.109 --> 01:00:31.064
TALIESIN: C-O-U-A-T-L?

01:00:31.064 --> 01:00:32.208
I don't know how to pronounce that.

01:00:32.208 --> 01:00:33.541
MATT: Yeah, couatl.
TALIESIN: Couatl.

01:00:33.541 --> 01:00:34.707
LIAM: Quetzalcoatl.

01:00:34.707 --> 01:00:36.304
TALIESIN: It's like a little serpent dragon.

01:00:36.304 --> 01:00:38.238
I say little.

01:00:38.238 --> 01:00:39.338
ASHLEY: Like those little--

01:00:39.338 --> 01:00:40.434
TALIESIN: It's bigger than that.

01:00:40.434 --> 01:00:41.464
ASHLEY: Smiley?

01:00:41.464 --> 01:00:43.164
LIAM: Feather-winged serpent?

01:00:43.164 --> 01:00:44.604
TALIESIN: It's a winged serpent.

01:00:44.604 --> 01:00:47.577
It's also invisible to scrying, which is nice.

01:00:47.577 --> 01:00:50.182
LIAM: Ooh!
ASHLEY: Ooh.

01:00:50.182 --> 01:00:51.015
TALIESIN: So.

01:00:51.015 --> 01:00:52.192
LIAM: Sassy, I like it.

01:00:52.192 --> 01:00:55.244
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's got some, and I'm just going to tell it

01:00:55.244 --> 01:00:57.844
to quietly play in the water until

01:00:57.844 --> 01:01:00.151
someone hostile comes towards us,

01:01:00.151 --> 01:01:01.084
and then defend us.
MATT: Okay.

01:01:01.084 --> 01:01:02.626
As you all settle in there,

01:01:02.626 --> 01:01:04.521
once again, Caleb able to find some of the sand

01:01:04.521 --> 01:01:05.354
between your toes if you pull

01:01:05.354 --> 01:01:06.412
your boots off a bit.
LIAM: Yeah, I pull the

01:01:06.412 --> 01:01:07.547
leaden boots off, yeah.
MATT: Yeah.

01:01:08.694 --> 01:01:10.844
As some of you aren't paying too much attention,

01:01:10.844 --> 01:01:13.714
suddenly you hear this faint crackle in the air

01:01:13.714 --> 01:01:16.484
and you glance over as Caduceus finishes the smile

01:01:16.484 --> 01:01:20.214
and it seems like a slow-moving lightning bolt

01:01:20.214 --> 01:01:22.164
(electricity) crackles through the air,

01:01:22.164 --> 01:01:26.294
and as it does, it forms into this large, elemental serpent

01:01:26.294 --> 01:01:28.414
that then scoots around

01:01:28.414 --> 01:01:30.134
in the air, directly around Caduceus,

01:01:30.134 --> 01:01:32.914
before he guides with his hand over towards the ocean.

01:01:32.914 --> 01:01:35.074
You watch as it dives

01:01:35.074 --> 01:01:38.504
into the water and just stays there,

01:01:38.504 --> 01:01:40.136
coasting through the shallow waves.

01:01:40.136 --> 01:01:41.172
TALIESIN: Having a little fun.

01:01:41.172 --> 01:01:43.924
Just, I said have fun until something happens.

01:01:43.924 --> 01:01:44.757
MATT: It's not going to argue.

01:01:44.757 --> 01:01:47.287
LAURA: Can I try, while we're resting--

01:01:48.834 --> 01:01:52.384
I want to try Divine Intervention

01:01:52.384 --> 01:01:53.674
with The Traveler.
MATT: Okay.

01:01:53.674 --> 01:01:55.174
What are you attempting to do?

01:01:56.004 --> 01:01:59.391
LAURA: Well, I want to see if it works
to see if I can ask him.

01:01:59.391 --> 01:02:00.724
MATT: Depends.

01:02:00.724 --> 01:02:03.581
Go ahead and try it and see if it'll function, roll for it.

01:02:03.581 --> 01:02:05.531
LIAM: Trickster domain!

01:02:09.404 --> 01:02:10.844
LAURA: Oh god, no.

01:02:10.844 --> 01:02:12.774
(laughter)

01:02:12.774 --> 01:02:13.883
99.

01:02:13.883 --> 01:02:15.917
(laughter)

01:02:15.917 --> 01:02:17.157
SAM: Your god dies.

01:02:18.416 --> 01:02:19.249
TRAVIS: (pained grunt)

01:02:21.104 --> 01:02:21.937
LAURA: So no.

01:02:23.221 --> 01:02:25.547
MATT: Get a of hint of what you were attempting to ask?

01:02:25.547 --> 01:02:27.394
LAURA: I was going to help him-- ask for some help

01:02:27.394 --> 01:02:29.844
with Modify Memory.

01:02:29.844 --> 01:02:30.677
MATT: Gotcha.

01:02:31.824 --> 01:02:34.752
As you reach out to grasp his attention, he's like,

01:02:36.464 --> 01:02:39.216
"I'm sorry, it's a bit of interference at the moment."

01:02:39.216 --> 01:02:40.049
LAURA: Yeah.

01:02:41.785 --> 01:02:43.261
MATT: "A bit predisposed,

01:02:43.261 --> 01:02:45.324
"but next time."

01:02:45.324 --> 01:02:47.554
LAURA: You don't want to hang with us on the beach?

01:02:47.554 --> 01:02:48.929
MATT: "Leave a message. Beep!"

01:02:48.929 --> 01:02:50.486
LAURA: Oh, he's--

01:02:50.486 --> 01:02:52.119
SAM: What's he doing? What is he doing?

01:02:52.119 --> 01:02:53.274
LAURA: He left me-- What?

01:02:53.274 --> 01:02:54.843
SAM: What was he up to?

01:02:54.843 --> 01:02:57.268
LAURA: I don't know. He's predisposed.
He's probably, you know.

01:02:57.268 --> 01:02:59.034
SAM: That sounds intriguing.

01:02:59.034 --> 01:03:01.274
LAURA: Strangling some people, I don't know.

01:03:01.274 --> 01:03:03.767
SAM: Jeez, does he do that?
LAURA: He does some freaky shit.

01:03:05.104 --> 01:03:06.794
SAM: You seem proud of that.

01:03:09.334 --> 01:03:11.346
MATT: All right.
So what's everyone doing?

01:03:11.346 --> 01:03:12.179
Is everyone--

01:03:12.179 --> 01:03:13.012
TRAVIS: Sitting, attuning.
SAM: Resting.

01:03:13.012 --> 01:03:14.694
MATT: Resting and attuning.

01:03:14.694 --> 01:03:16.969
TRAVIS: And I am using the rest of,

01:03:16.969 --> 01:03:20.484
what, like 20 minutes left of this hour?

01:03:20.484 --> 01:03:21.784
MATT: All right.
TRAVIS: To try and

01:03:22.984 --> 01:03:25.144
just keep an eye out for orbs or anything.

01:03:25.144 --> 01:03:27.001
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: That catches the eye.

01:03:27.001 --> 01:03:28.034
MATT: You got it.

01:03:28.034 --> 01:03:33.034
LIAM: Caleb is very much in shellshocked mode,

01:03:33.321 --> 01:03:35.464
similar to how he was at the beginning of the campaign

01:03:35.464 --> 01:03:38.174
in a way that he hasn't been in a long time,

01:03:38.174 --> 01:03:41.164
and he just plants himself next to Veth on the ground,

01:03:41.164 --> 01:03:42.484
and is just staring out at the water

01:03:42.484 --> 01:03:44.524
while he mashes his toes,

01:03:44.524 --> 01:03:46.647
scritches his toes in the sand, slowly.

01:03:47.654 --> 01:03:49.434
SAM: I'll just hug,

01:03:49.434 --> 01:03:53.207
hug, or stay close to cuddling distance, for Caleb.

01:03:55.204 --> 01:03:56.654
MATT: Anyone else doing anything during this rest?

01:03:56.654 --> 01:03:58.167
Or we'll move from there?

01:04:00.134 --> 01:04:03.914
ASHLEY: I'm going to walk just along the coast,

01:04:03.914 --> 01:04:07.737
away from everybody, and--

01:04:12.577 --> 01:04:17.052
Hey, uh, Storm Lord,

01:04:18.722 --> 01:04:20.861
it's me, Yasha,

01:04:22.314 --> 01:04:24.664
your old, uh, pal.

01:04:24.664 --> 01:04:25.497
Um--

01:04:28.634 --> 01:04:29.467
I--

01:04:33.754 --> 01:04:35.104
We're in a bit of a pickle.

01:04:36.184 --> 01:04:37.017
Um--

01:04:40.854 --> 01:04:42.414
I just, I-I-I--

01:04:42.414 --> 01:04:45.544
Well, for starters, I went on a date with Beau.

01:04:45.544 --> 01:04:47.004
I don't need to tell you these things.

01:04:47.004 --> 01:04:47.837
Um--

01:04:50.774 --> 01:04:52.347
I think I need your help.

01:04:55.304 --> 01:04:56.137
Um--

01:04:58.944 --> 01:04:59.997
I--

01:05:02.644 --> 01:05:03.617
That dream.

01:05:05.044 --> 01:05:05.877
Um--

01:05:08.124 --> 01:05:09.564
I want to be able to

01:05:11.574 --> 01:05:13.464
help my friends, and I-I think

01:05:13.464 --> 01:05:15.994
I-I've given away one of my swords

01:05:15.994 --> 01:05:17.394
to this woman named Kima,

01:05:17.394 --> 01:05:18.734
but she gave me one

01:05:20.284 --> 01:05:21.764
that seems very cool.

01:05:21.764 --> 01:05:22.597
Um--

01:05:27.044 --> 01:05:28.584
I don't know what I'm trying to say.

01:05:28.584 --> 01:05:29.447
I just,

01:05:34.424 --> 01:05:36.524
I don't know if you have a purpose for me,

01:05:36.524 --> 01:05:37.357
but--

01:05:42.024 --> 01:05:43.797
I would like to be your--

01:05:45.734 --> 01:05:47.384
I would like to be your champion.

01:05:54.294 --> 01:05:58.104
Anyway, um, I'm not used to being able

01:05:58.104 --> 01:06:00.174
to have conversations like this with you,

01:06:00.174 --> 01:06:01.844
this is very different than how Jester

01:06:01.844 --> 01:06:04.707
or Caduceus talks, but--

01:06:09.514 --> 01:06:10.631
Please, I--

01:06:12.972 --> 01:06:15.864
I would like to be the avatar of the Storm Lord,

01:06:18.424 --> 01:06:19.937
whatever that even means.

01:06:27.367 --> 01:06:30.337
I'll walk back to the group.

01:06:33.124 --> 01:06:37.424
LAURA: Did it seem like Yasha was having a talk?

01:06:37.424 --> 01:06:40.314
Could I see that she was chatting to somebody

01:06:40.314 --> 01:06:41.214
that wasn't there?

01:06:43.044 --> 01:06:46.284
MATT: At your passive perception, I'd say likely not,

01:06:46.284 --> 01:06:48.664
but you did watch her walk a little ways off

01:06:48.664 --> 01:06:50.338
and just take a little time on her own.

01:06:50.338 --> 01:06:52.604
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: Before returning.

01:06:52.604 --> 01:06:57.604
LAURA: I'll stop with my French braiding of Fjord's hair.

01:06:59.404 --> 01:07:01.902
I'll finish this in a minute.

01:07:01.902 --> 01:07:04.174
TRAVIS: But how did you--

01:07:04.174 --> 01:07:06.974
LAURA: I'll tie it off with a little piece of leather.

01:07:06.974 --> 01:07:09.891
TRAVIS: It feels like it's going to hurt.

01:07:11.174 --> 01:07:12.884
LAURA: I'll walk up to Yasha.

01:07:12.884 --> 01:07:13.717
MATT: Okay.

01:07:14.924 --> 01:07:15.757
ASHLEY: Hi.

01:07:17.024 --> 01:07:18.884
LAURA: What were you talking about?

01:07:18.884 --> 01:07:19.897
Is everything okay?

01:07:21.634 --> 01:07:22.634
ASHLEY: Everything's okay.

01:07:22.634 --> 01:07:23.527
I just--

01:07:25.724 --> 01:07:27.742
I don't know how you communicate

01:07:27.742 --> 01:07:30.734
with your god,

01:07:30.734 --> 01:07:32.174
and Caduceus with his,

01:07:32.174 --> 01:07:33.127
and I-I--

01:07:35.174 --> 01:07:38.404
I figure we're going to need all the help we can get.

01:07:38.404 --> 01:07:43.234
And I don't know-- I tried to communicate.

01:07:43.234 --> 01:07:45.304
You have such a different relationship,

01:07:45.304 --> 01:07:48.478
but I tried to communicate with the Storm Lord.

01:07:48.478 --> 01:07:50.464
LAURA: Oh. Oh!

01:07:50.464 --> 01:07:54.042
ASHLEY: And just say, "Hey, I'm here if you need me."

01:07:54.042 --> 01:07:55.654
Is that what I do?

01:07:55.654 --> 01:07:58.300
LAURA: I mean, I don't know how
it works with everybody else.

01:07:58.300 --> 01:08:00.244
Caduceus and Fjord, they talk to the Wild Mother

01:08:00.244 --> 01:08:02.364
completely different than obviously I talked to Artie,

01:08:02.364 --> 01:08:03.987
but, um,

01:08:05.993 --> 01:08:08.757
I may be able to help you.

01:08:10.475 --> 01:08:11.666
I have this--

01:08:15.474 --> 01:08:17.014
Okay, look.

01:08:17.014 --> 01:08:18.614
I don't know if this is going to work.

01:08:18.614 --> 01:08:20.054
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:08:20.054 --> 01:08:22.232
LAURA: But, here, sit down with me, sit down with me.

01:08:22.232 --> 01:08:23.169
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:08:23.169 --> 01:08:26.156
LAURA: And I sit cross-legged in front of Yasha.

01:08:26.156 --> 01:08:29.123
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll sit cross-legged in front of her.

01:08:29.123 --> 01:08:31.474
LAURA: And, I don't know,

01:08:31.474 --> 01:08:34.464
this might be like a little jumpstart.

01:08:34.464 --> 01:08:37.834
I mean, if you really want to
dedicate yourself to the Storm Lord,

01:08:37.834 --> 01:08:39.184
is that what you're asking?

01:08:41.334 --> 01:08:42.167
ASHLEY: Yes. I--

01:08:44.424 --> 01:08:46.524
I mean, he quite literally saved my life.

01:08:46.524 --> 01:08:48.474
I think it's only appropriate that I

01:08:50.594 --> 01:08:52.804
act as a champion for him.

01:08:52.804 --> 01:08:53.936
LAURA: Okay.

01:08:53.936 --> 01:08:58.310
I'm going to try to cast.

01:08:58.310 --> 01:09:00.360
I'm going to do Ceremony.

01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:01.364
SAM: Whoa.

01:09:01.364 --> 01:09:02.197
ASHLEY: What is that?

01:09:02.197 --> 01:09:05.344
LAURA: So I'm going to put my hands out

01:09:05.344 --> 01:09:07.387
and hold my hands in front of you,

01:09:08.454 --> 01:09:10.074
and close your eyes.

01:09:10.074 --> 01:09:11.684
ASHLEY: Okay.
LAURA: I've never done this before,

01:09:11.684 --> 01:09:14.070
but I feel like this is going to work.

01:09:14.070 --> 01:09:14.903
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:09:17.751 --> 01:09:22.307
LAURA: And I'm going to do Ceremony: Dedication.

01:09:23.303 --> 01:09:24.136
SAM: Whoa.

01:09:25.444 --> 01:09:28.477
LAURA: And I'm going to say:

01:09:28.477 --> 01:09:30.054
I know you're a little busy, Artie,

01:09:30.054 --> 01:09:34.847
so if you could just maybe help send a little power my way.

01:09:38.404 --> 01:09:41.337
And I'm going to say: Oh, Storm Lord.

01:09:42.244 --> 01:09:43.484
ASHLEY: Should I repeat after you?

01:09:43.484 --> 01:09:44.714
LAURA: Oh yeah, that's good.

01:09:46.154 --> 01:09:47.694
ASHLEY: Oh, Storm Lord.

01:09:49.521 --> 01:09:53.304
LAURA: Yasha is here for <i>you</i>!

01:09:54.431 --> 01:09:56.464
ASHLEY: Yasha is here for you.

01:09:56.464 --> 01:09:57.297
That's me.

01:09:57.297 --> 01:09:58.745
LAURA: Oh god, you're repeating me!

01:09:58.745 --> 01:10:00.344
ASHLEY: Well, I could be saying--
LAURA: No, yeah, that's good.

01:10:00.344 --> 01:10:02.519
That's good.
ASHLEY: Yes. I am here for you.

01:10:04.744 --> 01:10:07.734
LAURA: I want to be dedicated to <i>you</i>!

01:10:07.734 --> 01:10:09.894
ASHLEY: I want to be dedicated to you.

01:10:09.894 --> 01:10:11.754
LAURA: Make me your <i>champion</i>!

01:10:11.754 --> 01:10:13.094
ASHLEY: Make me your champion!

01:10:13.094 --> 01:10:16.334
LAURA: Bless me with your <i>dedication</i>!

01:10:16.334 --> 01:10:17.167
ASHLEY: What did you say?

01:10:17.167 --> 01:10:18.000
LAURA: Bless me with your dedication.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.174
ASHLEY: Bless me with your dedication!

01:10:20.174 --> 01:10:23.054
LAURA: And I'll bless you with mine.

01:10:23.054 --> 01:10:25.134
ASHLEY: And I will bless you with mine.

01:10:25.134 --> 01:10:26.524
LAURA: Yeah, that's good.

01:10:26.524 --> 01:10:30.634
And I'm going to send my power into her hands.

01:10:30.634 --> 01:10:32.594
And cast Dedication.

01:10:32.594 --> 01:10:33.944
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: Which is

01:10:33.944 --> 01:10:35.434
not quite the same thing,

01:10:35.434 --> 01:10:37.664
but I thought it would be a good starting off point,

01:10:37.664 --> 01:10:40.930
and it's, you are--

01:10:40.930 --> 01:10:45.930
I'm giving you the power to be
dedicated to your god's service.

01:10:46.034 --> 01:10:50.374
So it's technically for the next 24 hours,

01:10:50.374 --> 01:10:52.624
whenever you make a saving throw,

01:10:52.624 --> 01:10:54.344
you roll a d4 and add that number,

01:10:54.344 --> 01:10:55.926
it gives you a boost.

01:10:55.926 --> 01:10:57.214
ASHLEY: What?

01:10:57.214 --> 01:11:02.054
LAURA: But I thought it could give you that connection

01:11:02.054 --> 01:11:04.414
that maybe he'll be able to hear you and see you

01:11:04.414 --> 01:11:06.494
a little bit stronger right now.

01:11:06.494 --> 01:11:08.684
ASHLEY: Jester, thank you so much.

01:11:08.684 --> 01:11:10.554
This is such a great way to learn.

01:11:10.554 --> 01:11:11.564
LAURA: Yeah.

01:11:11.564 --> 01:11:14.264
ASHLEY: I mean, I don't think
I'm going to be besties with him

01:11:14.264 --> 01:11:16.227
like you are with Artagan.

01:11:16.227 --> 01:11:18.208
LAURA: You don't know, you don't know.
ASHLEY: Who knows?

01:11:18.208 --> 01:11:19.162
I'd be up for it.

01:11:19.162 --> 01:11:20.431
LAURA: Maybe he needs a bestie.

01:11:20.431 --> 01:11:22.204
ASHLEY: Maybe he does.

01:11:22.204 --> 01:11:24.174
I think I would be a really good bestie to him

01:11:24.174 --> 01:11:25.529
if he really wanted it.

01:11:25.529 --> 01:11:27.031
LAURA: And he can probably hear you saying all of it now,

01:11:27.031 --> 01:11:27.864
because you're dedicated.

01:11:27.864 --> 01:11:28.697
ASHLEY: Yes.

01:11:28.697 --> 01:11:30.004
If you need just a best friend,

01:11:30.004 --> 01:11:31.771
someone to talk to, I'm here.

01:11:36.644 --> 01:11:39.894
I'm going to, in the sand, just take my finger

01:11:39.894 --> 01:11:42.757
and make a little lightning bolt.

01:11:44.336 --> 01:11:45.305
MATT: Okay.

01:11:45.305 --> 01:11:46.515
LAURA: That's beautiful.

01:11:46.515 --> 01:11:48.157
ASHLEY: Thank you.
LAURA: You're an artiste.

01:11:48.157 --> 01:11:50.764
ASHLEY: The last time I-I-I think I prayed to him,

01:11:50.764 --> 01:11:54.294
I drew a dick, because that's what you did,

01:11:54.294 --> 01:11:57.997
and then I realized maybe I should draw his symbol.

01:11:57.997 --> 01:11:59.944
LAURA: Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense, too.

01:11:59.944 --> 01:12:02.649
ASHLEY: He probably doesn't want a dick drawing.
LAURA: I'll draw

01:12:02.649 --> 01:12:04.540
a dick with lightning shooting out of it.

01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:06.526
Just to give it a little extra.

01:12:06.526 --> 01:12:07.875
ASHLEY: A little flair. Yeah.

01:12:07.875 --> 01:12:12.154
LAURA: And Yasha, (whispering) just so you know,

01:12:12.154 --> 01:12:14.464
I'm available for other ceremonies, too,

01:12:14.464 --> 01:12:17.094
if you ever wanted to do any.

01:12:17.094 --> 01:12:20.285
ASHLEY: Oh, what on earth do you mean?

01:12:21.414 --> 01:12:22.644
LAURA: I don't know how everything went.

01:12:22.644 --> 01:12:25.254
We haven't talked, but I'm letting you know,

01:12:25.254 --> 01:12:26.374
if it went really well,

01:12:26.374 --> 01:12:28.167
and things keep going really well,

01:12:28.167 --> 01:12:29.194
I'm here for you.

01:12:29.194 --> 01:12:30.587
ASHLEY: Thank you, Jester.

01:12:32.674 --> 01:12:34.184
Things went really well.

01:12:34.184 --> 01:12:35.387
Just side note.

01:12:36.344 --> 01:12:39.764
A very wise friend once told me that to kiss and tell

01:12:39.764 --> 01:12:41.257
would be very uncouth.

01:12:42.424 --> 01:12:46.464
So, um, I'll just keep it inside.

01:12:46.464 --> 01:12:47.297
LAURA: Okay.
ASHLEY: Maybe one day

01:12:47.297 --> 01:12:49.446
we'll talk about it, I don't know.

01:12:49.446 --> 01:12:50.704
Thank you, Jester.

01:12:54.154 --> 01:12:57.244
MATT: As you continue your rest here, at a certain point,

01:12:57.244 --> 01:12:58.994
once you have a moment to yourself,

01:12:59.974 --> 01:13:01.274
you glance over to the side

01:13:01.274 --> 01:13:03.344
and you can see Artie's sitting there,

01:13:03.344 --> 01:13:05.407
his feet in the sand as well,

01:13:06.764 --> 01:13:08.884
looks to be, himself, looking up.

01:13:08.884 --> 01:13:10.564
Eyes closed, sunbathing for a moment,

01:13:10.564 --> 01:13:12.537
and without opening his eyes, just goes,

01:13:13.534 --> 01:13:15.164
"I did the best I could.

01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:19.994
"I don't really have a extensive relationship

01:13:19.994 --> 01:13:21.722
"with the actual pantheon."

01:13:21.722 --> 01:13:23.211
LAURA: Oh yeah.

01:13:23.211 --> 01:13:25.814
But you have a better way of communicating with them

01:13:25.814 --> 01:13:27.030
than we do, right?

01:13:27.030 --> 01:13:30.144
MATT: "Well, I've only really interfaced with one,

01:13:30.144 --> 01:13:31.234
"and you were present for that,

01:13:31.234 --> 01:13:33.824
"and it didn't really go my way.

01:13:33.824 --> 01:13:38.824
"But the very least, I let a little,

01:13:38.944 --> 01:13:39.874
"I don't know what you would call it,

01:13:39.874 --> 01:13:44.874
"a divine spotlight on our friends.

01:13:44.894 --> 01:13:46.274
"Hopefully it's enough."

01:13:46.274 --> 01:13:48.647
LAURA: I lean over and I just pull his eyelid open.

01:13:49.774 --> 01:13:50.607
Hi.

01:13:52.794 --> 01:13:55.554
Do you want a coconut alcoholic beverage?

01:13:55.554 --> 01:13:56.819
Beau bought a few.

01:13:56.819 --> 01:13:58.912
MATT: "Please."

01:13:58.912 --> 01:14:00.866
LAURA: Beau, B-Beau, B-Beau, Beau.

01:14:00.866 --> 01:14:01.744
MARISHA: Yeah?

01:14:01.744 --> 01:14:03.114
LAURA: Do you have any extra coconut drinks?

01:14:03.114 --> 01:14:05.124
I just offered one to Artagan.

01:14:05.124 --> 01:14:06.304
The Traveler, to the Traveler.

01:14:06.304 --> 01:14:07.754
MARISHA: I bought two extras to go.

01:14:09.914 --> 01:14:10.747
MATT: Hmm.

01:14:11.674 --> 01:14:15.304
As you're holding them up to Jester,

01:14:15.304 --> 01:14:17.664
you look over to where she's looking towards Artagan,

01:14:17.664 --> 01:14:19.234
there's nobody there,

01:14:19.234 --> 01:14:22.124
look back and one of your drinks has gone,

01:14:22.124 --> 01:14:23.794
within an instant, like you glanced away

01:14:23.794 --> 01:14:24.674
and then you look over

01:14:24.674 --> 01:14:25.764
and look behind her

01:14:25.764 --> 01:14:27.744
and you can see the green cloak billowing.

01:14:27.744 --> 01:14:30.213
Like this epic shot of the wind

01:14:30.213 --> 01:14:32.370
just blowing the cloak as it

01:14:32.370 --> 01:14:35.384
flaps the hood up, the sea shoreline underneath it,

01:14:35.384 --> 01:14:39.414
the distant horizon as the sun's coming down in the sky,

01:14:39.414 --> 01:14:41.113
and you just see this little--

01:14:41.113 --> 01:14:42.769
(slurping)

01:14:42.769 --> 01:14:45.674
straw start slurping, before it

01:14:45.674 --> 01:14:47.194
(whooshing)

01:14:47.194 --> 01:14:48.444
disappears into the wind.

01:14:49.984 --> 01:14:52.489
MARISHA: He'll never not be unsettling, just a little bit.

01:14:52.489 --> 01:14:54.774
LAURA: He's the best, isn't he just the best?

01:14:54.774 --> 01:14:56.094
ASHLEY: He's growing on me, I will say that.

01:14:56.094 --> 01:14:57.524
He's growing on me.
MARISHA: Yeah, he's growing on me.

01:14:57.524 --> 01:15:00.004
LAURA: I am hoping if we give
him enough alcoholic beverages,

01:15:00.004 --> 01:15:03.584
someday he's going to help me with that Divine Intervention.

01:15:03.584 --> 01:15:05.044
He'll be there in that moment

01:15:05.044 --> 01:15:07.244
that really, really, really counts, you know?

01:15:07.244 --> 01:15:08.897
TRAVIS: Hammered.

01:15:08.897 --> 01:15:11.054
LAURA: Wasted, just totally drunk.

01:15:11.054 --> 01:15:13.054
MARISHA: I mean, some of Nott's best moments

01:15:13.054 --> 01:15:14.954
were when she was trashed.

01:15:14.954 --> 01:15:16.024
LAURA: That's not true, Nott.

01:15:16.024 --> 01:15:17.104
SAM: It is true.

01:15:17.104 --> 01:15:18.949
LAURA: Your best moments are when you're sober and present.

01:15:18.949 --> 01:15:20.454
SAM: I'm worthless without alcohol.

01:15:20.454 --> 01:15:21.982
Thank you for pointing that out.

01:15:21.982 --> 01:15:26.389
(laughter)

01:15:26.389 --> 01:15:27.222
I'm just kidding.

01:15:27.222 --> 01:15:29.617
MARISHA: You're Veth now, it's fine.
SAM: I'm fucking with you.

01:15:29.617 --> 01:15:31.184
I don't really have a taste for it anymore.

01:15:31.184 --> 01:15:33.692
It's good, it's good. It's just I like the sweeter stuff.

01:15:33.692 --> 01:15:35.164
MARISHA: Sure. Yeah.

01:15:35.164 --> 01:15:36.814
Little dessert cocktails.

01:15:36.814 --> 01:15:38.188
SAM: Yeah! Some sherry.

01:15:38.188 --> 01:15:40.461
ASHLEY: With the fruit and the flowers,

01:15:40.461 --> 01:15:41.801
and the umbrellas and stuff.

01:15:41.801 --> 01:15:43.419
SAM: Yeah, white wine spritzer.

01:15:44.302 --> 01:15:46.834
LIAM: White wine spritzer.

01:15:46.834 --> 01:15:48.250
LAURA: Oh, he's off.

01:15:48.250 --> 01:15:50.224
SAM: Oh no. Oh god, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:15:50.224 --> 01:15:52.482
I didn't mean to say a vaguely German word.

01:15:52.482 --> 01:15:53.625
(laughter)

01:15:53.625 --> 01:15:54.460
TRAVIS: Spritzer.

01:15:56.177 --> 01:15:57.095
LIAM: Wolf Blitzer.

01:15:57.095 --> 01:15:59.164
TRAVIS: No Z's. No Z's.

01:15:59.164 --> 01:16:00.294
SAM: Oh no.

01:16:00.294 --> 01:16:02.786
Spritzer means something in Zemnian.

01:16:02.786 --> 01:16:05.867
It means patricide, oh no!

01:16:08.524 --> 01:16:09.357
MATT: All right.

01:16:09.357 --> 01:16:12.464
LAURA: I'll finish braiding Fjord's hair,
once all that's done.

01:16:12.464 --> 01:16:13.479
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: Ah!

01:16:13.479 --> 01:16:15.964
LAURA: It's a nice, cute little French braid

01:16:15.964 --> 01:16:17.374
up where your man bun is,

01:16:17.374 --> 01:16:19.794
and then it just ties up.

01:16:19.794 --> 01:16:22.917
So it still is very masculine.
TRAVIS: You keep it out of my face?

01:16:22.917 --> 01:16:24.699
LAURA: Yeah. But now, yeah.

01:16:24.699 --> 01:16:26.457
ASHLEY: It looks really good.

01:16:27.384 --> 01:16:28.217
TRAVIS: Nice.
MATT: All right.

01:16:28.217 --> 01:16:29.354
With your attunement complete,

01:16:29.354 --> 01:16:31.697
your short rest coming to an end,

01:16:33.484 --> 01:16:34.317
what's next?

01:16:35.374 --> 01:16:36.664
SAM: What <i>is</i> next?

01:16:36.664 --> 01:16:38.399
Now we can talk, freely.

01:16:38.399 --> 01:16:39.840
LAURA: Now we can really talk, right?
TALIESIN: Pat the couatl.

01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:42.943
SAM: So these things protects us from all scrying?

01:16:42.943 --> 01:16:44.670
LAURA: I don't know. I haven't--

01:16:44.670 --> 01:16:48.231
TRAVIS: Divination, Scrying, so.

01:16:48.231 --> 01:16:49.680
SAM: Fucking awesome.
LIAM: Unless

01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:54.125
Lucien is of demigod status,

01:16:54.125 --> 01:16:56.721
which doesn't seem entirely impossible,

01:16:57.719 --> 01:16:59.634
we should be fine.

01:16:59.634 --> 01:17:00.467
SAM: This is great.

01:17:00.467 --> 01:17:01.334
TRAVIS: In theory.

01:17:01.334 --> 01:17:02.634
LIAM: In theory.

01:17:02.634 --> 01:17:04.204
SAM: I got these other things,

01:17:04.204 --> 01:17:06.309
I got these vials of--
LAURA: Oh man!

01:17:06.309 --> 01:17:09.644
SAM: -- were they vials or crystals?
LAURA: Crystals or something.

01:17:09.644 --> 01:17:10.764
MATT: Crystals.

01:17:10.764 --> 01:17:13.012
SAM: Crystals in something, or just hanging out?

01:17:13.012 --> 01:17:14.714
MATT: They're just a loose cluster of crystals.

01:17:14.714 --> 01:17:16.169
SAM: A loose cluster of crystals.

01:17:16.169 --> 01:17:20.044
MATT: As you pull them out, you recognize them immediately,

01:17:20.044 --> 01:17:21.911
and your forearms begin to itch.

01:17:21.911 --> 01:17:25.564
MARISHA: Oh, shit.

01:17:25.564 --> 01:17:27.554
LAURA: Is it the bad stuff?

01:17:27.554 --> 01:17:30.254
LIAM: He holds up and you see all the little

01:17:30.254 --> 01:17:34.284
semi-invisible lines on his arms.

01:17:34.284 --> 01:17:36.701
TRAVIS: Those were what they put in your arms?

01:17:36.701 --> 01:17:37.644
LIAM: (whispering) Yeah.

01:17:37.644 --> 01:17:39.044
LAURA: To make you more powerful.

01:17:40.074 --> 01:17:42.464
SAM: Are they that residuum stuff?

01:17:42.464 --> 01:17:45.855
LIAM: Yeah, but you'll notice my friends, uh--

01:17:46.838 --> 01:17:48.379
"my friends."

01:17:50.364 --> 01:17:53.364
They're tattooed up.

01:17:53.364 --> 01:17:54.197
SAM: They're what?

01:17:54.197 --> 01:17:55.564
LIAM: This is where he did his work.

01:17:55.564 --> 01:17:59.237
It was primarily on our arms,

01:18:00.254 --> 01:18:03.794
because of somatics.

01:18:03.794 --> 01:18:04.627
But, um--

01:18:06.714 --> 01:18:11.714
I left before whatever his plan was could be

01:18:12.430 --> 01:18:14.880
completed, and they did not.

01:18:16.824 --> 01:18:17.917
So these--

01:18:21.734 --> 01:18:23.142
somehow led to that.

01:18:29.504 --> 01:18:31.534
SAM: Do you have some in you right now?

01:18:31.534 --> 01:18:32.367
LIAM: No.

01:18:34.294 --> 01:18:36.421
I can still feel them though.

01:18:36.421 --> 01:18:37.254
A little bit.

01:18:37.254 --> 01:18:38.354
LAURA: How many did we get?

01:18:39.624 --> 01:18:43.184
MATT: It was a quick grab, probably two handfuls worth.

01:18:43.184 --> 01:18:45.815
TRAVIS: And they are green residuum?

01:18:45.815 --> 01:18:48.094
MATT: Like a green-blue coloration,

01:18:48.094 --> 01:18:51.494
you're not entirely certain what material they're made of.

01:18:51.494 --> 01:18:53.334
TRAVIS: Green-blue.

01:18:53.334 --> 01:18:56.187
LIAM: I always imagine them as rough hewn little rubies.

01:18:57.624 --> 01:18:59.831
Almost just a little jagged shards.
LAURA: Can we Identify it for sure?

01:18:59.831 --> 01:19:00.944
MARISHA: Yeah. Yeah.

01:19:00.944 --> 01:19:02.304
I pick one up and just look at it.

01:19:02.304 --> 01:19:06.194
Do I get any type of recognizing the stone in any way,

01:19:06.194 --> 01:19:08.071
history-wise?

01:19:09.556 --> 01:19:11.775
MATT: Make a general intelligence check.

01:19:13.224 --> 01:19:14.057
MARISHA: Okay.

01:19:15.244 --> 01:19:18.694
Ooh, that was a natural 19.

01:19:18.694 --> 01:19:20.404
So 23.

01:19:20.404 --> 01:19:21.237
MATT: 23.

01:19:22.494 --> 01:19:24.774
It's no natural stone that you've come across,

01:19:24.774 --> 01:19:28.334
and you're not deeply versed

01:19:28.334 --> 01:19:29.914
in the ways of natural gemstone,

01:19:29.914 --> 01:19:31.864
beyond the ones that you've encountered in your lifetime,

01:19:31.864 --> 01:19:33.834
but something about this coloration,

01:19:33.834 --> 01:19:35.474
and when you hold it up to the light in front of you

01:19:35.474 --> 01:19:39.234
with just the horizon and the cloudless light

01:19:39.234 --> 01:19:41.064
finding its way behind the side,

01:19:41.064 --> 01:19:43.204
it looks ever so loosely refracting through its color,

01:19:43.204 --> 01:19:45.294
you can see the imperfections in the center of it,

01:19:45.294 --> 01:19:49.487
but it does have a weird, almost

01:19:49.487 --> 01:19:53.384
unnatural pattern within the depth of the crystal.

01:19:53.384 --> 01:19:55.454
You get the sense it's probably, to certain degree,

01:19:55.454 --> 01:19:58.275
synthetic, from magical origins.

01:19:59.904 --> 01:20:01.004
Make an arcana check.

01:20:02.704 --> 01:20:03.911
TRAVIS: Come on, big stat, big stat for you.

01:20:03.911 --> 01:20:05.552
MARISHA: Yep, you know me.

01:20:05.552 --> 01:20:07.244
Know my magic.

01:20:07.244 --> 01:20:10.687
Rolled a 14, so 18 total.

01:20:11.534 --> 01:20:12.974
MATT: 18.

01:20:12.974 --> 01:20:14.377
TRAVIS: You got a +4 in arcana?!

01:20:14.377 --> 01:20:15.643
MARISHA: I do.

01:20:15.643 --> 01:20:17.494
It's because it's my intelligence.

01:20:17.494 --> 01:20:19.586
Yeah, just my base intelligence.

01:20:22.494 --> 01:20:25.427
MATT: It has similarities to the...

01:20:26.719 --> 01:20:30.164
the top of the tripod setup

01:20:30.164 --> 01:20:32.974
that you saw in Yussa's tower,

01:20:32.974 --> 01:20:37.544
that Jester used when she was attempting to scry,

01:20:37.544 --> 01:20:38.844
not that long before.

01:20:38.844 --> 01:20:42.094
So you get the sense it has some sort of amplification,

01:20:42.094 --> 01:20:45.434
which means it does have elements of residuum in it,

01:20:45.434 --> 01:20:46.954
which gives it that greenish tint

01:20:46.954 --> 01:20:48.094
when the light goes through it,

01:20:48.094 --> 01:20:49.754
but it's not pure residuum,

01:20:49.754 --> 01:20:52.684
it's almost like it's a--

01:20:52.684 --> 01:20:55.548
MARISHA: Battery, almost.
LIAM: It's crystal meth.

01:20:55.548 --> 01:20:56.381
MATT: More or less, yeah.

01:20:56.381 --> 01:21:01.301
It's a heavily refined and...

01:21:01.301 --> 01:21:02.917
cobbled element

01:21:02.917 --> 01:21:06.190
based in some way with residuum and something else.

01:21:08.414 --> 01:21:09.764
ASHLEY: How many vials are there?

01:21:09.764 --> 01:21:11.804
SAM: Well, they're shards, crystal shards,

01:21:11.804 --> 01:21:15.784
and there's, I don't know, 18, 20, 16?

01:21:15.784 --> 01:21:20.184
MATT: We'll say 22 shards of differing sizes.

01:21:20.184 --> 01:21:22.543
Two quick Veth hand grabs full.

01:21:22.543 --> 01:21:23.408
SAM: What do we do with these?

01:21:23.408 --> 01:21:26.494
MARISHA: Should you grind them down? Get the residuum out of it?

01:21:26.494 --> 01:21:27.478
Utilize it as a component?

01:21:27.478 --> 01:21:30.394
SAM: Probably, but they might be more valuable as-is.

01:21:30.394 --> 01:21:33.174
LAURA: Yeah, we could potentially use them

01:21:33.174 --> 01:21:37.877
like Orly gave us all of these.

01:21:38.734 --> 01:21:41.024
We could make tattoos out of them as well.

01:21:41.024 --> 01:21:42.290
LIAM: Please, no.

01:21:44.590 --> 01:21:45.598
LAURA: We don't have to.

01:21:45.598 --> 01:21:49.407
LIAM: I would like to keep at least one of them as evidence.

01:21:50.442 --> 01:21:52.821
LAURA: Oh yeah, that's smart.

01:21:52.821 --> 01:21:53.654
TALIESIN: Very smart.

01:21:53.654 --> 01:21:57.447
ASHLEY: He would put these things into your system?

01:21:59.694 --> 01:22:00.527
LIAM: Yes.

01:22:00.527 --> 01:22:02.304
We would spend a night--

01:22:03.374 --> 01:22:05.324
They're not always there, but he would,

01:22:06.754 --> 01:22:10.847
sometimes on our own, sometimes the three of us together,

01:22:12.624 --> 01:22:14.984
he would insert them into incisions he made,

01:22:14.984 --> 01:22:19.114
and it was a lot to tolerate them being there,

01:22:19.114 --> 01:22:23.077
and then we would try to cast,

01:22:24.114 --> 01:22:25.681
to see the difference.

01:22:28.044 --> 01:22:30.739
It was quite painful,

01:22:31.994 --> 01:22:33.337
but we did it gladly.

01:22:35.184 --> 01:22:38.497
For the greater good.

01:22:39.934 --> 01:22:42.897
TRAVIS: Evidence to show whom?

01:22:48.594 --> 01:22:51.014
LIAM: I would like to think that someone in the government,

01:22:51.014 --> 01:22:55.534
or outside of it, would care that this has been done to me

01:22:55.534 --> 01:22:57.477
and others like me,

01:22:58.454 --> 01:23:01.567
and likely is still being done to children.

01:23:02.974 --> 01:23:04.265
Like we were.

01:23:05.596 --> 01:23:06.987
MARISHA: I'm sure of it.

01:23:08.214 --> 01:23:09.540
LIAM: I would hope, anyway.

01:23:09.540 --> 01:23:11.734
LAURA: The Cobalt Soul, maybe?

01:23:11.734 --> 01:23:13.167
MARISHA: We could start there.

01:23:14.224 --> 01:23:18.124
TRAVIS: Doesn't the Cerberus Assembly
dictate governmental matters

01:23:18.124 --> 01:23:20.082
in the Empire?

01:23:21.764 --> 01:23:24.234
LIAM: Well, it's a negotiation between them and the king.

01:23:24.234 --> 01:23:26.804
They advise him and he makes the decisions.

01:23:26.804 --> 01:23:28.690
That's the official story.

01:23:30.901 --> 01:23:33.309
You know, we've talked a lot about

01:23:35.434 --> 01:23:38.284
the people who run our country

01:23:38.284 --> 01:23:42.964
and maybe it could be salvaged,

01:23:42.964 --> 01:23:45.231
maybe there is a way to improve it.

01:23:47.284 --> 01:23:48.634
Maybe there isn't.

01:23:49.584 --> 01:23:52.914
SAM: Well, Yussa might like to look at these,

01:23:52.914 --> 01:23:54.227
if we go visit him,

01:23:55.164 --> 01:23:57.104
but we should keep some as evidence,

01:23:57.104 --> 01:24:00.757
and we can't be seen now, so we can go see your mom.

01:24:03.104 --> 01:24:04.544
LIAM: Yeah, we should actually do that right away.

01:24:04.544 --> 01:24:06.546
We should make sure that the three of them are safe

01:24:06.546 --> 01:24:10.444
and figure out where we are going to send them.

01:24:10.444 --> 01:24:13.044
LAURA: I think we should send them to The Gentleman.

01:24:13.044 --> 01:24:13.877
(giggles knowingly)

01:24:13.877 --> 01:24:17.580
For reasons outside of just, you know,

01:24:17.580 --> 01:24:20.238
obviously, they'll fall back in love.

01:24:21.694 --> 01:24:25.814
He's used to keeping things very secret, very safe.

01:24:25.814 --> 01:24:27.564
SAM: He's great with kids, I'm sure.

01:24:27.564 --> 01:24:28.944
LAURA: Yeah. Obviously.

01:24:28.944 --> 01:24:31.004
LIAM: And no one knows about them other than you.

01:24:31.004 --> 01:24:33.754
TALIESIN: Well, there is a problem.

01:24:33.754 --> 01:24:35.864
One other person knows about him.

01:24:35.864 --> 01:24:36.884
LIAM: Cree.
MARISHA: Cree.

01:24:36.884 --> 01:24:37.717
TALIESIN: Oh, Cree.

01:24:37.717 --> 01:24:39.484
I was talking about The Gentleman.

01:24:39.484 --> 01:24:41.554
LAURA: Oh, yeah, The Gentleman is where

01:24:41.554 --> 01:24:42.387
we were going to send them.

01:24:42.387 --> 01:24:44.244
TALIESIN: There's one other person who knows about him.

01:24:44.244 --> 01:24:45.077
LAURA: Who?

01:24:46.334 --> 01:24:47.584
TALIESIN: Eyes of Nine.

01:24:47.584 --> 01:24:48.574
All of them.
LAURA: Yeah.

01:24:48.574 --> 01:24:49.444
MARISHA: Right, Cree.
LAURA: Yeah.

01:24:49.444 --> 01:24:50.277
TALIESIN: Cree knows.

01:24:50.277 --> 01:24:51.719
My brain, what just happened?

01:24:51.719 --> 01:24:53.144
(laughter)

01:24:53.144 --> 01:24:55.319
TRAVIS: Whoa.
TALIESIN: I'm getting feedback.

01:24:56.414 --> 01:24:57.247
TALIESIN: Wow.
MATT: I was like,

01:24:57.247 --> 01:24:59.276
"Wow, he's leaning into
the role play for low intelligence."

01:24:59.276 --> 01:25:00.854
(laughter)

01:25:00.854 --> 01:25:01.804
TALIESIN: Sleep deprivation.

01:25:01.804 --> 01:25:03.254
TRAVIS: Who else knows about them?

01:25:03.254 --> 01:25:07.274
LAURA: Don't ever give Caduceus
those coconut drinks, ever again.

01:25:08.314 --> 01:25:09.804
TALIESIN: They are liquored, aren't they?

01:25:09.804 --> 01:25:13.762
MARISHA: Oh, I might've accidentally
switched up your virgin one.

01:25:13.762 --> 01:25:14.950
I'm sorry.

01:25:14.950 --> 01:25:16.994
SAM: Yeah, but just because they know about The Gentleman

01:25:16.994 --> 01:25:20.394
doesn't necessarily mean they know

01:25:20.394 --> 01:25:23.254
that that we're sending some of our family

01:25:23.254 --> 01:25:26.574
to go to be with The Gentlemen for safety,

01:25:26.574 --> 01:25:29.034
because we're worried that the Empire might track them down.

01:25:29.034 --> 01:25:31.854
TALIESIN: The only ally we have
that they really know about, though,

01:25:31.854 --> 01:25:35.571
or one of the few, it's the only reason I bring it up.

01:25:35.571 --> 01:25:38.764
SAM: I mean, I think they're in Eiselcross

01:25:38.764 --> 01:25:40.084
doing their Eiselcross thing.

01:25:40.084 --> 01:25:41.344
I don't think they're--

01:25:41.344 --> 01:25:42.424
TALIESIN: That's fair.

01:25:42.424 --> 01:25:45.910
TRAVIS: Plus you said Trent wanted to talk.

01:25:45.910 --> 01:25:48.654
It wasn't like he was trying to kill you outright.

01:25:48.654 --> 01:25:49.954
Though it seemed that way.

01:25:52.071 --> 01:25:53.676
What does he want?

01:25:53.676 --> 01:25:55.532
LIAM: I have theories, only.

01:25:57.034 --> 01:25:58.824
Maybe it just as he says,

01:25:58.824 --> 01:26:00.574
maybe he wants me as a successor,

01:26:00.574 --> 01:26:02.174
but I find that--

01:26:04.241 --> 01:26:05.504
It's what I'm scared is the case,

01:26:05.504 --> 01:26:07.507
but I find that hard to believe.

01:26:09.334 --> 01:26:14.281
Part of me wonders if there is not some similarity between

01:26:14.281 --> 01:26:16.139
Part of me wonders if there is not some similarity between

01:26:16.139 --> 01:26:18.109
my old teacher and Halas.

01:26:21.544 --> 01:26:25.844
TRAVIS: Yes, definitely picking up
that vibe from both of them.

01:26:25.844 --> 01:26:26.987
LIAM: He's old.

01:26:28.124 --> 01:26:30.344
MARISHA: You're a valuable asset now.

01:26:30.344 --> 01:26:35.344
Especially if he knows that you know magic that he doesn't

01:26:35.434 --> 01:26:37.428
in the dunamancy realm.

01:26:37.428 --> 01:26:40.314
TRAVIS: And that you've survived where Vess DeRogna hasn't.

01:26:40.314 --> 01:26:41.964
MARISHA: Yeah.
LAURA: Wow.

01:26:41.964 --> 01:26:46.384
MARISHA: No one feels good about the one that got away.

01:26:46.384 --> 01:26:51.264
LIAM: And all of this discussion of them,

01:26:51.264 --> 01:26:55.744
their colluding with people on the inside of the Dynasty,

01:26:55.744 --> 01:27:00.454
and their research and knowledge of the Luxon,

01:27:00.454 --> 01:27:05.439
and maybe he means for me to be a vessel.

01:27:05.439 --> 01:27:06.572
and maybe he means for me to be a vessel.

01:27:08.954 --> 01:27:09.787
LAURA: Maybe.

01:27:10.944 --> 01:27:12.224
LIAM: Stray idea.

01:27:12.224 --> 01:27:14.814
TALIESIN: I'd want to know why you would take that risk,

01:27:14.814 --> 01:27:17.094
to go there and get what we got.

01:27:17.094 --> 01:27:19.512
I mean, if I was in his position.

01:27:19.512 --> 01:27:21.274
That's a big red flag.

01:27:21.274 --> 01:27:22.604
LIAM: Why <i>I</i> would go there?

01:27:22.604 --> 01:27:23.547
TALIESIN: Well.

01:27:23.547 --> 01:27:24.434
SAM: Or anyone.

01:27:24.434 --> 01:27:26.144
TRAVIS: He knows how dangerous it was for you.

01:27:26.144 --> 01:27:27.044
He knows it's a risk.

01:27:27.044 --> 01:27:28.864
Why risk it? Why do you need it so badly?

01:27:28.864 --> 01:27:30.034
And what did you need it for?

01:27:30.034 --> 01:27:31.994
TALIESIN: Thank you.
LAURA: I bet he's so curious.

01:27:31.994 --> 01:27:32.827
TALIESIN: I'd be.

01:27:34.184 --> 01:27:35.284
MARISHA: If he keeps hitting you up

01:27:35.284 --> 01:27:36.531
and he keeps sending you messages,

01:27:36.531 --> 01:27:38.694
that feels like he's real pissed.

01:27:40.044 --> 01:27:42.671
LAURA: I mean, I can always send him another message.

01:27:42.671 --> 01:27:44.961
See what he wants to say.

01:27:44.961 --> 01:27:46.670
In 25 words or less.

01:27:50.227 --> 01:27:52.785
TRAVIS: You can't backtrace a message spell, right?

01:27:52.785 --> 01:27:54.643
I don't know these things.
MATT: Not that you're aware of.

01:27:54.643 --> 01:27:55.476
Make an arcana check.

01:27:55.476 --> 01:27:56.809
TRAVIS: You're asking the sailor?

01:27:56.809 --> 01:27:58.161
Cool.

01:27:58.161 --> 01:27:59.061
Plus two.

01:27:59.061 --> 01:28:00.169
Natural one!

01:28:00.169 --> 01:28:02.108
Are you fucking kidding me?!

01:28:02.108 --> 01:28:04.328
LIAM: ♪ Who lives in a pineapple under the sea? ♪

01:28:04.328 --> 01:28:08.585
(laughter)

01:28:08.585 --> 01:28:09.808
TRAVIS: Fair.

01:28:09.808 --> 01:28:10.913
Accurate.

01:28:10.913 --> 01:28:11.914
MATT: You got no idea.

01:28:11.914 --> 01:28:13.824
TRAVIS: Nope!
LIAM: Oh boy.

01:28:13.824 --> 01:28:15.024
ASHLEY: Wait, I'm sorry.

01:28:15.024 --> 01:28:16.907
Probably you all know this,

01:28:18.924 --> 01:28:20.124
and I'm sorry for bringing this up,

01:28:20.124 --> 01:28:23.064
but when you would put that into your system,

01:28:23.064 --> 01:28:25.444
would it make you stronger?

01:28:25.444 --> 01:28:27.437
Is that essentially what it does?

01:28:28.544 --> 01:28:32.502
LIAM: For-for-for the duration of its, you know,

01:28:32.502 --> 01:28:35.054
its entry into my person.

01:28:35.054 --> 01:28:38.442
It was not terribly long for me.

01:28:40.424 --> 01:28:42.654
LAURA: And they would remove it, or it would dissolve?

01:28:42.654 --> 01:28:44.704
LIAM: No, they would remove it,

01:28:44.704 --> 01:28:47.694
and replace on another day.

01:28:47.694 --> 01:28:49.654
SAM: I'm not suggesting this at all,

01:28:49.654 --> 01:28:52.414
but going up against Lucien,

01:28:52.414 --> 01:28:55.670
would it maybe give you an advantage in the fight?

01:28:57.204 --> 01:28:58.037
LAURA: No.

01:28:59.234 --> 01:29:02.947
LIAM: Respectfully, those are not coming anywhere near

01:29:04.564 --> 01:29:06.070
my person again.

01:29:08.194 --> 01:29:10.094
SAM: Of course, yeah, of course.

01:29:15.576 --> 01:29:18.234
LIAM: Let's go find your family.
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:29:18.234 --> 01:29:19.067
SAM: All right.

01:29:20.464 --> 01:29:21.898
TRAVIS: Close shave.

01:29:21.898 --> 01:29:23.094
MATT: Okay.

01:29:23.094 --> 01:29:24.764
You gather your things,

01:29:24.764 --> 01:29:29.404
abscond from the beach and head back into Nicodranas proper.

01:29:29.404 --> 01:29:32.226
You're bee lining to where within the city?

01:29:32.226 --> 01:29:33.370
LAURA: The chateau.

01:29:33.370 --> 01:29:35.120
MATT: All right, so the Lavish Chateau.

01:29:36.334 --> 01:29:39.234
You head into the open doorways,

01:29:39.234 --> 01:29:42.217
the entryway just left in its casual,

01:29:42.217 --> 01:29:45.492
anyone-may-enter presentation,

01:29:45.492 --> 01:29:47.784
the welcoming warm inside

01:29:47.784 --> 01:29:50.654
where the gentle smells of incense and perfumes

01:29:50.654 --> 01:29:52.664
greets your nostrils.

01:29:52.664 --> 01:29:54.834
Stepping within, you can see some of the lanterns

01:29:54.834 --> 01:29:55.667
set on the tables,

01:29:55.667 --> 01:29:58.624
with a soft glow to light the darkened interior.

01:29:58.624 --> 01:29:59.544
You can see the staircase

01:29:59.544 --> 01:30:00.894
that leads up to the next floor,

01:30:00.894 --> 01:30:03.384
and there to the left you can see the wide bar,

01:30:03.384 --> 01:30:05.714
where I would say right now,

01:30:05.714 --> 01:30:08.277
Carlos would be currently at.

01:30:09.784 --> 01:30:13.144
There are, it looks to be about eight patrons,

01:30:13.144 --> 01:30:14.414
scattered amongst the tables.

01:30:14.414 --> 01:30:15.683
What do you want to do?

01:30:15.683 --> 01:30:16.958
LAURA: I'm going to go--

01:30:18.044 --> 01:30:20.178
Did I see Bluud?

01:30:20.178 --> 01:30:22.000
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:30:25.114 --> 01:30:25.947
TRAVIS: Peck.

01:30:27.214 --> 01:30:29.374
LAURA: 22.

01:30:29.374 --> 01:30:31.871
MATT: Glancing across the room, you do not see Bluud.

01:30:31.871 --> 01:30:33.604
You do not have to roll very high

01:30:33.604 --> 01:30:34.634
to notice that a minotaur

01:30:34.634 --> 01:30:37.367
is not currently present in the room.

01:30:37.367 --> 01:30:39.887
But not down here on the base floor, though.

01:30:39.887 --> 01:30:42.074
LAURA: I'm going to head upstairs.

01:30:42.074 --> 01:30:43.421
MATT: Okay. Everyone else following?

01:30:43.947 --> 01:30:45.113
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

01:30:45.113 --> 01:30:46.714
SAM: Is that okay?
LAURA: Yeah.

01:30:46.714 --> 01:30:48.577
TALIESIN: Any of the customers checking us out

01:30:48.577 --> 01:30:49.410
as we go upstairs?

01:30:49.410 --> 01:30:50.243
Are we getting any--?

01:30:50.243 --> 01:30:51.234
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:30:53.597 --> 01:30:56.197
TALIESIN: That's a natural 20 plus--

01:30:56.197 --> 01:30:58.097
TRAVIS: Wow!
TALIESIN: 30, 30.

01:30:58.097 --> 01:30:59.087
30's what we got.

01:30:59.087 --> 01:31:00.795
ASHLEY: Whoa!
MATT: A 30.

01:31:02.662 --> 01:31:05.587
I mean, most of the people at the central tables

01:31:05.587 --> 01:31:07.917
are all in the process of having made conversations

01:31:07.917 --> 01:31:10.477
and you're an eclectic bunch as you walk through,

01:31:10.477 --> 01:31:12.117
as people notice as you pass by.

01:31:12.117 --> 01:31:14.697
Some individuals may recognize you

01:31:14.697 --> 01:31:16.557
who have been patrons of the establishment

01:31:16.557 --> 01:31:18.324
for a protracted period of time.

01:31:22.129 --> 01:31:23.697
I hate that I can't whisper from this distance

01:31:23.697 --> 01:31:25.180
and I look forward to--
TALIESIN: You can text.

01:31:25.180 --> 01:31:26.107
SAM: Just FaceTime!

01:31:26.107 --> 01:31:27.212
TALIESIN: Text, just text.

01:31:27.212 --> 01:31:29.217
(laughter)

01:31:29.217 --> 01:31:30.243
TALIESIN: Text.
MARISHA: Hey, you have

01:31:30.243 --> 01:31:31.697
your ear pods in, right?
SAM: Just hold up your phone.

01:31:31.697 --> 01:31:35.287
TRAVIS: This whisper is brought to you by Dwarven Forge!

01:31:35.287 --> 01:31:37.087
LIAM: You mean like how I FaceTimed all of you

01:31:37.087 --> 01:31:38.757
from my butt this morning?

01:31:38.757 --> 01:31:39.957
TALIESIN: That was amazing.
SAM and TRAVIS: Twice!

01:31:39.957 --> 01:31:41.657
LIAM: Twice in five minutes.

01:31:41.657 --> 01:31:43.707
TRAVIS: We jumped on to have a conversation with your butt,

01:31:43.707 --> 01:31:45.757
but your butt wasn't there.

01:31:45.757 --> 01:31:47.497
TALIESIN: This is what we used to do at the home table.

01:31:47.497 --> 01:31:49.834
LIAM: He's more of the silent but deadly type.

01:31:49.834 --> 01:31:54.235
(laughter)

01:31:54.235 --> 01:31:55.907
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

01:31:55.907 --> 01:31:56.740
SAM: Yep.

01:31:56.740 --> 01:31:57.573
TALIESIN: Don't mean for it to get

01:31:57.573 --> 01:31:58.881
quiet while this happens.
SAM: We've regressed in technology

01:31:58.881 --> 01:32:02.127
to writing letters to each other at the table.

01:32:02.127 --> 01:32:03.568
MATT: Yep.
LIAM: Caw caw!

01:32:06.009 --> 01:32:07.027
LAURA: I want to know!
MATT: That still took too long

01:32:07.027 --> 01:32:08.057
for my liking.

01:32:08.057 --> 01:32:09.097
LIAM: Yeah, I miss the whispers.

01:32:09.097 --> 01:32:10.597
I miss people. I miss hugs.

01:32:10.597 --> 01:32:12.150
MATT: Yeah. I miss you guys.
LAURA: I miss-- yeah.

01:32:12.150 --> 01:32:13.941
SAM: Nah, this is fine.
ASHLEY: Me, too.

01:32:13.941 --> 01:32:14.774
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:32:14.774 --> 01:32:17.577
MATT: But yeah, as you head up the stairs

01:32:17.577 --> 01:32:19.417
there at the next landing outside of the door,

01:32:19.417 --> 01:32:23.227
you do see Bluud is currently there, sitting,

01:32:23.227 --> 01:32:25.437
finishing the crust end

01:32:25.437 --> 01:32:27.867
of a heavy sandwich and has a small plate,

01:32:27.867 --> 01:32:31.557
daintily placed on his massive lap.

01:32:31.557 --> 01:32:34.442
As you begin to step up the heavy wooden stairs,

01:32:34.442 --> 01:32:36.470
Bluud begins to sit up for a bit.

01:32:36.470 --> 01:32:37.303
"Oh.

01:32:38.678 --> 01:32:40.579
"Can I help you, Jester?"

01:32:40.579 --> 01:32:41.837
LAURA: Is Mama inside?

01:32:42.845 --> 01:32:43.984
MATT: "She's taking a nap."

01:32:43.984 --> 01:32:46.190
LAURA: Did Yeza and Luc show up?

01:32:46.190 --> 01:32:47.227
MATT: "Mm-hmm."

01:32:47.227 --> 01:32:48.869
LAURA: Are they staying in one of the other rooms?

01:32:48.869 --> 01:32:50.197
MATT: "They're down this way."

01:32:50.197 --> 01:32:53.377
And he points to one of the other guest rooms

01:32:53.377 --> 01:32:54.907
towards the end of the hallway,

01:32:54.907 --> 01:32:56.387
just next to the bathroom

01:32:56.387 --> 01:33:00.737
which has a new bathtub installed in it.

01:33:00.737 --> 01:33:02.860
TALIESIN: Another quick question, friend.

01:33:03.884 --> 01:33:05.457
Who are those two over there?

01:33:05.457 --> 01:33:07.737
They're giving me the heebie-jeebies.

01:33:07.737 --> 01:33:08.820
Over by the door.

01:33:09.738 --> 01:33:11.770
MATT: "I don't know. Should I go talk to them?"

01:33:13.796 --> 01:33:16.427
TALIESIN: I'm trying to keep it low-key, but

01:33:16.427 --> 01:33:17.877
we're probably being followed

01:33:17.877 --> 01:33:21.059
and they're giving me a weird vibe.

01:33:21.059 --> 01:33:22.457
MATT: "Fair enough."

01:33:22.457 --> 01:33:23.290
TALIESIN: Thank you.

01:33:24.479 --> 01:33:25.320
LAURA: Bluud?

01:33:25.320 --> 01:33:27.125
SAM: (yelps)

01:33:27.125 --> 01:33:30.037
LAURA: When he says we're being followed,

01:33:30.037 --> 01:33:33.597
things could get real hairy, real soon.

01:33:33.597 --> 01:33:36.087
So it might be smart to shut down

01:33:36.087 --> 01:33:37.600
the downstairs for a while.

01:33:39.185 --> 01:33:40.610
MATT: "I don't understand."

01:33:43.964 --> 01:33:44.864
LAURA: It could be bad.

01:33:50.037 --> 01:33:51.497
MATT: "How long?"

01:33:51.497 --> 01:33:53.057
LAURA: I don't know.

01:33:53.057 --> 01:33:54.897
But we should clear it out at least for the day

01:33:54.897 --> 01:33:57.225
so nobody wanders in.

01:33:59.446 --> 01:34:00.279
MATT: "Hmm.

01:34:01.917 --> 01:34:03.197
"I'll go talk to Carlos

01:34:03.197 --> 01:34:05.450
"after I see what's up with these strangers."

01:34:07.392 --> 01:34:09.892
Makes his way down the stairs to the bottom floor.

01:34:11.527 --> 01:34:12.657
I mean, your mom's chamber door is there.

01:34:12.657 --> 01:34:14.450
It's not locked, necessarily.

01:34:15.857 --> 01:34:17.007
LAURA: Do you guys mind if I go in?

01:34:17.007 --> 01:34:19.077
She's sleeping, I'll just get her up.

01:34:19.077 --> 01:34:20.043
TALIESIN: That works fine.

01:34:20.043 --> 01:34:21.918
I want to keep this in eyeshot.
SAM: My peeps, too.

01:34:21.918 --> 01:34:23.417
TRAVIS: Does someone need to go with--?

01:34:23.417 --> 01:34:25.548
He seems very capable.

01:34:25.548 --> 01:34:26.852
SAM: You should go.
LAURA: If you want to go make sure

01:34:26.852 --> 01:34:29.177
Bluud says the right things, sure.

01:34:29.177 --> 01:34:30.266
TRAVIS: I'll tag along with Bluud,

01:34:30.266 --> 01:34:32.117
but I'll use Mask of Many Faces

01:34:32.117 --> 01:34:33.447
to change my appearance.

01:34:33.447 --> 01:34:35.707
MATT: Into?
TALIESIN: I'm going to give you Resistance just in case.

01:34:35.707 --> 01:34:37.997
TRAVIS: Great. Humanoid.

01:34:37.997 --> 01:34:40.047
Shoulder length, black hair, black beard.

01:34:42.577 --> 01:34:44.247
Look like I work here.

01:34:44.247 --> 01:34:45.137
MATT: Okay.

01:34:45.137 --> 01:34:46.560
TRAVIS: Low-middle security type.

01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:47.678
MATT: And you're just hanging to his side,

01:34:47.678 --> 01:34:49.727
or keeping back or helping him with--

01:34:49.727 --> 01:34:50.877
TRAVIS: Actually, yeah.
MATT: What are doing?

01:34:50.877 --> 01:34:52.897
TRAVIS: I'll stay within earshot, but I'll

01:34:52.897 --> 01:34:56.237
look like I'm busing tables or wiping things down,

01:34:56.237 --> 01:34:57.337
but just keeping--

01:34:57.337 --> 01:34:58.170
MATT: Okay.

01:34:58.170 --> 01:35:00.037
TALIESIN: I'm going to shift into my human form too

01:35:00.037 --> 01:35:03.047
while I'm out of sight, just so I can walk down

01:35:03.047 --> 01:35:05.797
and keep an eye on things from a long distance.

01:35:05.797 --> 01:35:06.880
MATT: Okay. You got it.

01:35:07.737 --> 01:35:09.547
You go ahead and (door creaks) make your way

01:35:09.547 --> 01:35:11.371
into your mom's room and there you can see

01:35:11.371 --> 01:35:15.777
the doors are closed to the outside balcony,

01:35:15.777 --> 01:35:17.967
a window is open and a little bit of a breeze

01:35:17.967 --> 01:35:19.097
is blowing through the silks

01:35:19.097 --> 01:35:23.097
hanging from her bed. They sway ever so gently

01:35:23.097 --> 01:35:24.777
and you can see her with a book

01:35:24.777 --> 01:35:27.207
still partially open across her chest and shoulder

01:35:27.207 --> 01:35:30.024
as she's curled up for a midday nap.

01:35:30.024 --> 01:35:31.987
LAURA: I'll go and lay down in bed next to her

01:35:31.987 --> 01:35:34.143
and lay my head on her shoulder.

01:35:35.267 --> 01:35:38.887
MATT: Doesn't wake her, but she instinctively goes

01:35:38.887 --> 01:35:41.674
and grabs you and pulls you in for a cuddle

01:35:41.674 --> 01:35:45.185
while she-- (sighs)

01:35:46.652 --> 01:35:47.485
LAURA: Mama?

01:35:51.317 --> 01:35:53.167
MATT: Her eyes flutter open a little bit.

01:35:56.503 --> 01:35:57.336
LAURA: Hi.

01:36:00.260 --> 01:36:01.593
MATT: "Just a second.

01:36:03.187 --> 01:36:04.551
"My Sapphire?"

01:36:04.551 --> 01:36:06.647
LAURA: I missed you.
MATT: "My Sapphire!"

01:36:06.647 --> 01:36:08.877
And her eyes shoot wide open and she just gives you

01:36:08.877 --> 01:36:11.757
a big, big hug and pulls you in closely.

01:36:11.757 --> 01:36:13.777
"Oh," the book crushes a little bit

01:36:13.777 --> 01:36:15.477
before it tumbles off to the side.

01:36:16.397 --> 01:36:17.887
Pulls you away and looks at your face,

01:36:17.887 --> 01:36:20.247
her thumbs right there on your cheeks.

01:36:20.247 --> 01:36:22.507
"I didn't know you were going to visit today."

01:36:22.507 --> 01:36:25.220
LAURA: I didn't either. (laughs)

01:36:27.081 --> 01:36:28.252
MATT: "But it's good to see you."

01:36:28.252 --> 01:36:29.085
LAURA: You, too.

01:36:30.101 --> 01:36:32.459
MATT: "Everything okay? Are you safe?"

01:36:32.459 --> 01:36:34.134
LAURA: Yes, everything is--

01:36:38.977 --> 01:36:40.458
Everything's not okay.

01:36:45.627 --> 01:36:47.190
Mama, I have to tell you.

01:36:50.284 --> 01:36:51.976
I'm going to pull out the one of the necklaces.

01:36:51.976 --> 01:36:53.587
I want you to wear this, okay?

01:36:53.587 --> 01:36:54.590
Don't take it off.

01:36:55.690 --> 01:36:57.397
MATT: "What is this for?"

01:36:57.397 --> 01:36:58.417
LAURA: It will keep you safe.

01:36:58.417 --> 01:37:03.039
It will keep people from being able to spy on you for now.

01:37:03.039 --> 01:37:04.839
MATT: Her eyes dart towards the window.

01:37:05.697 --> 01:37:07.640
LAURA: It's okay, just wear it.

01:37:09.897 --> 01:37:12.597
MATT: She puts it on, holds it for a second, looks at you.

01:37:14.597 --> 01:37:16.590
"Jester, I hate seeing you like this.

01:37:17.617 --> 01:37:18.660
"What's going on?"

01:37:18.660 --> 01:37:19.685
LAURA: I don't know--

01:37:25.367 --> 01:37:27.567
There's a lot of bad things going on right now.

01:37:27.567 --> 01:37:30.977
A lot of them, in a lot of different ways.

01:37:30.977 --> 01:37:31.810
But--

01:37:35.507 --> 01:37:38.000
You could be in danger here.

01:37:40.717 --> 01:37:42.457
There's some really awful people,

01:37:42.457 --> 01:37:44.397
some really powerful, awful people

01:37:44.397 --> 01:37:46.517
that are coming after us

01:37:46.517 --> 01:37:48.870
and they know that I'm connected to you.

01:37:49.737 --> 01:37:50.790
And it scares me and

01:37:52.087 --> 01:37:55.230
I know how hard it is for you to leave.

01:37:57.117 --> 01:37:58.267
But I think you should.

01:37:59.217 --> 01:38:00.127
At least for a while,

01:38:00.127 --> 01:38:01.777
I'll let you know when it's safe.

01:38:09.007 --> 01:38:12.127
MATT: "Jester, I--

01:38:13.437 --> 01:38:14.317
"It's difficult for me

01:38:14.317 --> 01:38:16.515
"to think I could be safer anywhere else."

01:38:16.515 --> 01:38:18.332
LAURA: I know.

01:38:18.332 --> 01:38:20.997
MATT: "I've been here most of my life.

01:38:20.997 --> 01:38:22.517
"Everyone here knows me."

01:38:22.517 --> 01:38:23.417
LAURA: I know.

01:38:23.417 --> 01:38:25.587
MATT: "If anyone wanted to come and harm me,

01:38:25.587 --> 01:38:30.187
"they'd have to go through a lot of very powerful people

01:38:30.187 --> 01:38:31.587
"here in Nicodranas."

01:38:31.587 --> 01:38:33.097
LAURA: They wouldn't have to do any of that.

01:38:33.097 --> 01:38:36.145
They could just literally appear next to you.

01:38:38.597 --> 01:38:40.510
They're really powerful people, Mama.

01:38:41.387 --> 01:38:44.373
More than anything we've ever come across.

01:38:47.927 --> 01:38:51.000
MATT: Her eyes dart back towards the window again.

01:38:52.537 --> 01:38:53.620
And back to you.

01:38:56.103 --> 01:39:00.457
And you can see that familiar look of shock

01:39:00.457 --> 01:39:02.810
and anxiety in her face.

01:39:04.416 --> 01:39:07.780
(sighs) "I don't even know where I'd go."

01:39:09.757 --> 01:39:12.477
LAURA: Look. (laughs)

01:39:12.477 --> 01:39:14.747
This is so stupid and you're going to think

01:39:14.747 --> 01:39:16.540
I'm trying to do something here.

01:39:17.547 --> 01:39:18.990
But I think you'd be safe--

01:39:20.527 --> 01:39:22.577
I think you'd be safe with The Gentleman.

01:39:23.677 --> 01:39:25.277
I think you'd be safe with Papa.

01:39:26.797 --> 01:39:29.197
I know, I know, and I haven't even asked him,

01:39:29.197 --> 01:39:30.577
I haven't talked to him at all,

01:39:30.577 --> 01:39:34.327
but he has an underground safe house.

01:39:34.327 --> 01:39:36.587
He's secret, nobody knows about it.

01:39:36.587 --> 01:39:38.437
It's the safest place I can think of.

01:39:44.223 --> 01:39:45.056
MATT: "Um."

01:39:47.507 --> 01:39:50.777
LAURA: W-w-we'll probably be staying here tonight, I think.

01:39:50.777 --> 01:39:52.637
I don't know, I haven't talked to everyone, but--

01:39:52.637 --> 01:39:54.467
MATT: "Okay, I can have rooms prepared.

01:39:54.467 --> 01:39:56.307
"I need some time to--"

01:39:56.307 --> 01:39:57.140
LAURA: I know.

01:39:59.667 --> 01:40:01.067
MATT: "I need some time to think."

01:40:03.771 --> 01:40:05.787
And she cups your face again and just gives you

01:40:05.787 --> 01:40:09.218
a little kiss in the nose and-- (sighs)

01:40:10.825 --> 01:40:12.408
"What have you done?"

01:40:13.897 --> 01:40:14.730
LAURA: I'm sorry.

01:40:17.296 --> 01:40:19.489
MATT: "I'm not angry, I just--

01:40:20.557 --> 01:40:22.997
"Just worry about you."

01:40:22.997 --> 01:40:23.830
LAURA: Yeah.

01:40:28.804 --> 01:40:30.660
I just want to keep you safe, okay?

01:40:32.677 --> 01:40:35.727
MATT: "That's all I've ever wanted, was to keep you safe."

01:40:36.924 --> 01:40:39.157
LAURA: I'm growing up. Now it's my turn.

01:40:39.157 --> 01:40:41.019
MATT: "Oh, don't tell me that; you'll make me cry."

01:40:41.019 --> 01:40:43.102
LAURA: (laughs)

01:40:46.659 --> 01:40:48.867
MATT: (sighs)

01:40:48.867 --> 01:40:49.740
LAURA: I love you.

01:40:50.866 --> 01:40:52.270
MATT: "I love you, too."

01:40:54.046 --> 01:40:55.907
LAURA: I'm going to go talk to everyone

01:40:55.907 --> 01:40:57.930
and see what the plan is, okay?

01:40:59.377 --> 01:41:00.210
MATT: "Okay."

01:41:08.147 --> 01:41:10.017
She grabs the book and closes it and goes,

01:41:10.017 --> 01:41:13.727
"I will finish this some other time." (laughs)

01:41:13.727 --> 01:41:15.777
She puts it on the edge of her bed stand.

01:41:20.917 --> 01:41:25.280
LAURA: If you want to get some things together.

01:41:26.253 --> 01:41:29.118
MATT: "Yeah, yeah, I would like to do that, yes.

01:41:31.827 --> 01:41:35.468
"Have Bluud fetch me one of

01:41:35.468 --> 01:41:37.747
"our finest wines for the journey."

01:41:37.747 --> 01:41:39.057
LAURA: Of course.

01:41:39.057 --> 01:41:40.898
MATT: "I don't think I can make it sober."

01:41:40.898 --> 01:41:42.039
LAURA: (laughs)

01:41:47.477 --> 01:41:49.520
MATT: "You are growing up."
LAURA: I hold onto her hands.

01:41:50.877 --> 01:41:54.440
MATT: "You are growing up, aren't you?"

01:41:54.440 --> 01:41:56.790
LAURA: Too fast! (laughs)

01:41:59.954 --> 01:42:00.787
MATT: "But--

01:42:01.778 --> 01:42:04.232
"More proud than I could ever think.

01:42:08.354 --> 01:42:09.795
"And maybe there'll be a day

01:42:09.795 --> 01:42:13.178
"where there won't be people chasing you."

01:42:14.247 --> 01:42:15.947
LAURA: That would be wonderful.

01:42:15.947 --> 01:42:18.797
We found this wonderful little island.

01:42:18.797 --> 01:42:19.937
Maybe at the end of everything

01:42:19.937 --> 01:42:24.230
we can go there and have a happy tropical home.

01:42:25.907 --> 01:42:27.845
MATT: "I look forward to you showing me one day."

01:42:27.845 --> 01:42:28.695
LAURA: I will.

01:42:30.077 --> 01:42:32.037
I'll be back, I'm just going to talk to everyone,

01:42:32.037 --> 01:42:33.287
figure out the plan, okay?

01:42:33.287 --> 01:42:34.777
MATT: "Okay."
LAURA: Okay.

01:42:34.777 --> 01:42:35.777
MATT: While this is happening--

01:42:35.777 --> 01:42:37.783
SAM: I've gone to see Yeza.

01:42:37.783 --> 01:42:40.160
MATT: So you make your way to the chamber on the side.

01:42:41.157 --> 01:42:44.897
SAM: Probably had a very similar conversation.

01:42:44.897 --> 01:42:47.662
And that is why you must always wear these.

01:42:47.662 --> 01:42:50.917
(laughter)

01:42:50.917 --> 01:42:52.651
LIAM: That made me want to DeNiro cry.

01:42:52.651 --> 01:42:54.112
(laughter)

01:42:54.112 --> 01:42:56.062
LIAM: (sobbing)

01:42:56.062 --> 01:42:57.953
MATT: "Well, I just-- I'm--"

01:42:59.674 --> 01:43:00.507
SAM: It's--

01:43:02.501 --> 01:43:03.334
I've--

01:43:05.485 --> 01:43:08.176
I've done real bad, Yeza.

01:43:08.176 --> 01:43:09.802
I've messed up, you know?

01:43:09.802 --> 01:43:11.508
MATT: "W-w-what did you do? What's going on?"

01:43:11.508 --> 01:43:13.309
SAM: Well, it's not just what I've done,

01:43:13.309 --> 01:43:15.177
it's-- I've brought danger to you

01:43:15.177 --> 01:43:17.277
and that's inexcusable.

01:43:17.277 --> 01:43:20.117
I thought that I could do both, you know?

01:43:20.117 --> 01:43:22.607
That I could have a fun life of adventure

01:43:22.607 --> 01:43:26.257
and also have a family, but I can't.

01:43:26.257 --> 01:43:28.157
I can't do both, so--

01:43:30.497 --> 01:43:32.030
MATT: "Look, you haven't brought danger to us."

01:43:32.030 --> 01:43:33.872
SAM: I have!
MATT: "Danger has

01:43:33.872 --> 01:43:35.527
"been finding its way into our lives

01:43:35.527 --> 01:43:36.980
"before you did any of this."

01:43:38.407 --> 01:43:40.757
SAM: But this danger I brought.

01:43:40.757 --> 01:43:44.967
And it's unforgivable and I know that you'll forgive me

01:43:44.967 --> 01:43:49.517
for it and you're stupid for doing so,

01:43:49.517 --> 01:43:52.277
because it's really-- it's unforgivable.

01:43:52.277 --> 01:43:53.420
MATT: He just kisses you.

01:43:54.997 --> 01:43:56.790
SAM: I mean, that's pretty nice.

01:43:57.827 --> 01:43:58.660
MATT: "Veth.

01:44:01.657 --> 01:44:04.137
"I mean, I'm not going to lie,

01:44:04.137 --> 01:44:07.327
"I have spent so much of my life

01:44:07.327 --> 01:44:09.377
"just trying to--

01:44:11.444 --> 01:44:13.819
"trying to be something for you.

01:44:13.819 --> 01:44:18.501
"To start a business, to try and

01:44:18.501 --> 01:44:20.985
"focus on my work and,

01:44:20.985 --> 01:44:23.925
"you know, make you proud.

01:44:23.925 --> 01:44:24.910
"In the long run,

01:44:27.187 --> 01:44:29.470
"I mean, it got us ransacked.

01:44:31.177 --> 01:44:35.760
"It got you killed just from being near.

01:44:37.417 --> 01:44:40.060
"Then you came back and then the Assembly got involved,

01:44:40.060 --> 01:44:42.213
"I mean, how much danger has

01:44:44.347 --> 01:44:47.237
"the choices I've made brought into our life?

01:44:47.237 --> 01:44:49.042
"I carry that guilt with me, too.

01:44:50.627 --> 01:44:51.460
"But...

01:44:54.377 --> 01:44:55.830
"since you've gone off and

01:44:57.997 --> 01:44:59.647
"met your

01:45:01.439 --> 01:45:04.314
"really impressive and intimidating friends,

01:45:05.417 --> 01:45:07.527
"I've had a lot of time to spend with Luc.

01:45:07.527 --> 01:45:11.227
"And I never thought myself as a stay-at-home dad, but--"

01:45:11.227 --> 01:45:12.297
SAM: You're really good at it.

01:45:12.297 --> 01:45:13.347
MATT: "I kind of really like it."

01:45:13.347 --> 01:45:16.607
SAM: And you're fantastic with children,

01:45:16.607 --> 01:45:18.657
you're fantastic with me,

01:45:18.657 --> 01:45:23.020
but it's just not fair anymore, so,

01:45:24.587 --> 01:45:26.967
what I'd like to do very much,

01:45:26.967 --> 01:45:28.370
if it's okay with you,

01:45:29.537 --> 01:45:32.507
I'd like to fix this

01:45:32.507 --> 01:45:37.507
and help end the immediate threat.

01:45:39.757 --> 01:45:42.748
And then I want to come home

01:45:42.748 --> 01:45:45.303
and just be with you and the boy.

01:45:47.227 --> 01:45:52.205
And if I can do that, if I can manage to do that,

01:45:53.047 --> 01:45:55.197
I will not go away again

01:45:55.197 --> 01:45:58.817
and I will not bring danger anymore.

01:45:58.817 --> 01:46:01.937
We'll find some way to have adventures together,

01:46:01.937 --> 01:46:06.937
and we'll have adventures together at home,

01:46:07.137 --> 01:46:09.977
wherever we decide to make our home.

01:46:09.977 --> 01:46:14.467
But unfortunately, I have to fix this.

01:46:14.467 --> 01:46:15.650
Or help fix it.

01:46:16.887 --> 01:46:19.140
And then that's it, all right?

01:46:19.997 --> 01:46:23.657
Can you hold on just a few more weeks?

01:46:23.657 --> 01:46:25.237
MATT: "I'll hold on as long as you need me to.

01:46:25.237 --> 01:46:27.697
"I know what you're doing is important.

01:46:27.697 --> 01:46:30.122
"Not just important to the world, but I mean--"

01:46:32.600 --> 01:46:34.247
And he grabs both your hands and pulls you in

01:46:34.247 --> 01:46:36.497
and puts his forehead against yours and says,

01:46:38.927 --> 01:46:41.017
"I know you can't see yourself,

01:46:41.017 --> 01:46:43.747
"but I've watched you glow

01:46:43.747 --> 01:46:46.857
"and smile in ways I've never seen

01:46:47.967 --> 01:46:50.350
"since you've met these people.

01:46:51.247 --> 01:46:53.710
"Since you've gone out and

01:46:56.057 --> 01:46:59.067
"struck down dangerous beasts

01:46:59.067 --> 01:47:04.067
"and swindled those who deserve to be taken down.

01:47:06.387 --> 01:47:08.047
"Every story you come back with

01:47:08.047 --> 01:47:11.607
"fills me with a burst of anxiety and worry,

01:47:11.607 --> 01:47:14.510
"but also a pride that I can't express.

01:47:15.917 --> 01:47:20.537
"Part of what's really been an unexpected joy for me

01:47:20.537 --> 01:47:23.257
"is realizing that so many years of trying

01:47:23.257 --> 01:47:26.830
"to be the man of the house--

01:47:28.737 --> 01:47:31.905
"I'm much better being the support of it.

01:47:33.657 --> 01:47:35.800
"I could never do the things you do."

01:47:37.957 --> 01:47:41.430
SAM: I didn't think I could either, so.

01:47:43.367 --> 01:47:45.647
I'd be very curious to see what you could do,

01:47:45.647 --> 01:47:47.400
and what we could do together.

01:47:51.347 --> 01:47:54.900
You're right, I feel much better about myself these days.

01:47:55.937 --> 01:48:00.160
And I feel like I'm almost happy with myself.

01:48:02.677 --> 01:48:04.940
But if I can just get that last step,

01:48:07.157 --> 01:48:09.700
we'll have a great time and a great life together.

01:48:10.767 --> 01:48:12.797
So thank you for waiting for me

01:48:14.257 --> 01:48:18.790
and for keeping the boy happy.

01:48:20.747 --> 01:48:24.177
I mean, he seems like he doesn't know what's going on,

01:48:24.177 --> 01:48:26.407
which is great. Keep it that way.

01:48:26.407 --> 01:48:28.387
MATT: "I'm deflecting left and right."

01:48:28.387 --> 01:48:30.578
SAM: You're really great at that.

01:48:32.727 --> 01:48:33.907
Anyway.

01:48:33.907 --> 01:48:35.717
I think we have a plan, we're going to move you

01:48:35.717 --> 01:48:37.650
to a place that's safe.

01:48:38.817 --> 01:48:40.987
Heads up, it's weird.

01:48:40.987 --> 01:48:42.087
It's a weird place.

01:48:42.087 --> 01:48:43.447
Wait, you've been there!

01:48:43.447 --> 01:48:45.597
Oh, we just took you there recently, actually.

01:48:45.597 --> 01:48:46.790
You waited outside.

01:48:48.379 --> 01:48:49.212
TRAVIS: That's right.

01:48:49.212 --> 01:48:50.707
SAM: We're going back again.

01:48:50.707 --> 01:48:54.107
It's a nasty, seedy bar,

01:48:54.107 --> 01:48:56.617
but-- it's also run by a criminal,

01:48:56.617 --> 01:49:00.317
but it's really, it's very safe.

01:49:00.317 --> 01:49:01.617
We think?

01:49:01.617 --> 01:49:03.807
We think it's very safe.
MATT: "We're taking Luc?!"

01:49:03.807 --> 01:49:06.017
SAM: You're going to live there.

01:49:06.017 --> 01:49:08.157
In this bar, I guess.

01:49:08.157 --> 01:49:11.507
But you know, this is a bar too, right?

01:49:11.507 --> 01:49:12.340
So.

01:49:12.340 --> 01:49:13.173
MATT: "Okay."

01:49:14.567 --> 01:49:15.770
SAM: Just for a little bit.

01:49:18.875 --> 01:49:22.277
I gave you that thousand gold a while ago.

01:49:22.277 --> 01:49:23.637
Is it back at the house?

01:49:23.637 --> 01:49:25.127
Should I just go get it?

01:49:25.127 --> 01:49:26.370
MATT: "Maybe, yeah."
SAM: Okay.

01:49:26.370 --> 01:49:27.862
MATT: "I don't carry that kind of change

01:49:27.862 --> 01:49:28.927
"with me on the streets."
SAM: Okay, yeah.

01:49:28.927 --> 01:49:30.427
I'll go, just give me a list

01:49:30.427 --> 01:49:32.225
of what you need from the house, I'll go get it.

01:49:32.225 --> 01:49:33.827
MATT: "Okay, I'll put together a list."
SAM: I'll pack it up.

01:49:33.827 --> 01:49:35.617
We'll go stay at this seedy bar

01:49:35.617 --> 01:49:37.997
for just a couple weeks.

01:49:37.997 --> 01:49:40.007
MATT: "Okay."
SAM: And then I'll come home

01:49:40.007 --> 01:49:43.760
and we'll figure out what the next step is together.

01:49:46.607 --> 01:49:48.957
MATT: "Look, I've been dragged
through the tunnels under Exandria.

01:49:48.957 --> 01:49:52.597
"I've seen the heights and depths of Xhorhas,

01:49:52.597 --> 01:49:56.177
"I've no reason to believe

01:49:56.177 --> 01:49:57.947
"that spending a little time in a seedy bar is

01:49:57.947 --> 01:49:59.037
"going to be anything stranger

01:49:59.037 --> 01:50:00.937
"than this past year has brought to us.

01:50:03.055 --> 01:50:05.166
"I'm excited to have you back.

01:50:05.166 --> 01:50:07.250
"I know you have to do this, but please,

01:50:09.027 --> 01:50:10.510
"please be safe.

01:50:11.937 --> 01:50:13.717
"You don't have to be the hero.

01:50:13.717 --> 01:50:15.220
"Not for me, you already are."

01:50:19.347 --> 01:50:20.180
SAM: I know.

01:50:21.507 --> 01:50:22.857
I will do my best.

01:50:22.857 --> 01:50:25.730
No. I promise you, I'll be safe.

01:50:26.587 --> 01:50:28.077
I'll come home.

01:50:28.077 --> 01:50:29.450
MATT: "I'll hold you to that."

01:50:31.544 --> 01:50:33.064
(yelps) And he ducks out of the way

01:50:33.064 --> 01:50:35.919
as a stick rod flies by--
SAM: Nice!

01:50:35.919 --> 01:50:37.697
and Luc's like, "Oh!

01:50:37.697 --> 01:50:38.530
"Sorry!"

01:50:38.530 --> 01:50:41.087
SAM: No, it was a good sneak up! Good stealthing!

01:50:41.087 --> 01:50:42.557
Good stuff.

01:50:42.557 --> 01:50:43.777
MATT: "You promised you were going to tell me

01:50:43.777 --> 01:50:46.467
"about the craziest thing that you killed?"

01:50:46.467 --> 01:50:49.032
SAM: Well, there's been a few new ones since then.

01:50:49.032 --> 01:50:49.865
MATT: "What?"

01:50:51.977 --> 01:50:55.687
SAM: Oh boy, I mean, there's baby monsters.

01:50:55.687 --> 01:50:57.377
Baby monsters was pretty--

01:50:57.377 --> 01:51:00.837
baby monster was probably pretty bad.

01:51:00.837 --> 01:51:01.767
Pretty gross.

01:51:01.767 --> 01:51:04.337
It wasn't a real baby; it just looked like a baby,

01:51:04.337 --> 01:51:05.627
but it was big.

01:51:05.627 --> 01:51:07.704
Had these razor-sharp teeth.

01:51:07.704 --> 01:51:09.217
And it was going to kill all my friends

01:51:09.217 --> 01:51:11.707
until I jumped in front of it

01:51:11.707 --> 01:51:14.360
and sacrificed my body to protect them!

01:51:15.637 --> 01:51:17.477
MATT: "Wow!"

01:51:17.477 --> 01:51:20.190
As this conversation's happening,

01:51:22.127 --> 01:51:25.827
Yasha, Caleb, Beau, what are you guys doing?

01:51:25.827 --> 01:51:28.009
MARISHA: I guess we're waiting outside for these guys.

01:51:28.009 --> 01:51:29.362
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MATT: So you're just hanging

01:51:29.362 --> 01:51:30.617
in the hallway upstairs?

01:51:30.617 --> 01:51:32.027
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:51:32.027 --> 01:51:36.037
LIAM: I trailed her to her home. To Veth.

01:51:36.037 --> 01:51:37.529
SAM: Oh, I'm here

01:51:37.529 --> 01:51:38.407
at the Chateau.
LIAM: They're here?

01:51:38.407 --> 01:51:39.877
Then I trailed you to their room

01:51:39.877 --> 01:51:41.027
and I'm waiting outside the door.

01:51:41.027 --> 01:51:42.597
MATT: Okay. Got it.

01:51:42.597 --> 01:51:43.657
All right.

01:51:43.657 --> 01:51:44.717
MARISHA: So we're awkwardly waiting

01:51:44.717 --> 01:51:47.047
outside of people's doors.
MATT: On the second floor, yeah.

01:51:47.047 --> 01:51:48.697
MARISHA: Being pretty useful.

01:51:48.697 --> 01:51:50.607
MATT: For a handful of minutes

01:51:50.607 --> 01:51:52.597
as these conversations are happening.

01:51:52.597 --> 01:51:54.055
MARISHA: Yasha and I just make out

01:51:54.055 --> 01:51:56.402
in between people walking by.

01:51:56.402 --> 01:51:57.739
ASHLEY: Just ping pong down the hallway.

01:51:57.739 --> 01:51:59.181
MATT: Right.
MARISHA: Just making out.

01:51:59.181 --> 01:52:00.724
MATT: Right.

01:52:00.724 --> 01:52:02.187
The horny teenager,

01:52:02.187 --> 01:52:03.897
not wasting any moment.
MARISHA: For sure.

01:52:03.897 --> 01:52:05.235
MATT: Yeah, I got it.
ASHLEY: Messing up

01:52:05.235 --> 01:52:07.650
all the picture frames
SAM: What about this weird staircase?

01:52:07.650 --> 01:52:08.858
We'll be safe here.

01:52:08.858 --> 01:52:10.087
ASHLEY: Staircase will be fun!

01:52:10.087 --> 01:52:11.817
MARISHA: Go under there!
ASHLEY: Let's try it.

01:52:11.817 --> 01:52:13.817
It's kind of uncomfortable, but it's kind of fun!

01:52:13.817 --> 01:52:15.217
MARISHA: Yeah, no one's in here

01:52:15.217 --> 01:52:17.417
until after the ball team leaves, it's fine.

01:52:18.977 --> 01:52:20.392
MATT: That poor teachers' lounge, man.

01:52:20.392 --> 01:52:22.374
MARISHA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Oh no.

01:52:22.374 --> 01:52:24.487
LIAM: If this has wound down,

01:52:24.487 --> 01:52:25.477
then when you open the door,

01:52:25.477 --> 01:52:29.687
you find Caleb standing really at attention

01:52:29.687 --> 01:52:31.970
with two books in his arms and he says:

01:52:31.970 --> 01:52:33.537
Ah,

01:52:33.537 --> 01:52:36.147
good evening, Mr. Brenatto.
SAM: Oh, hi!

01:52:36.147 --> 01:52:38.797
LIAM: I'm here to speak to young Master Brenatto.

01:52:38.797 --> 01:52:39.630
Is he at home?

01:52:39.630 --> 01:52:42.930
SAM: Oh! He's here, if you can find him!

01:52:44.807 --> 01:52:46.935
MATT: At which point you hear--
LIAM: Hello?

01:52:46.935 --> 01:52:49.507
MATT: (thumping)

01:52:49.507 --> 01:52:50.747
LIAM: What was that sound?
MATT: With your perception,

01:52:50.747 --> 01:52:53.867
you easily see this halfling boy

01:52:54.707 --> 01:52:57.357
jump over the bed, almost like a 70s action movie

01:52:57.357 --> 01:53:00.227
sliding over the car hood, just jumps over the bed,

01:53:00.227 --> 01:53:01.967
folds with it and then ducks underneath the bed

01:53:01.967 --> 01:53:03.397
and is quietly sitting there

01:53:03.397 --> 01:53:06.147
with this little toy crossbow there,

01:53:06.147 --> 01:53:07.617
waiting in shadow.

01:53:07.617 --> 01:53:11.040
LIAM: Careful, I do not have my Ring of Evasion on anymore.

01:53:12.057 --> 01:53:14.597
Mortal peril around you.

01:53:14.597 --> 01:53:15.607
I've come looking for you.

01:53:15.607 --> 01:53:17.382
May I borrow you for a word?

01:53:18.417 --> 01:53:19.787
MATT: "Dang it, I thought he couldn't see me."

01:53:19.787 --> 01:53:22.467
SAM: He's a wizard, he can see through walls.

01:53:22.467 --> 01:53:23.560
MATT: "That's unfair."

01:53:23.560 --> 01:53:24.944
SAM: Yeah.

01:53:24.944 --> 01:53:26.047
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:53:26.047 --> 01:53:28.477
LIAM: But pertinent to our conversation.

01:53:28.477 --> 01:53:31.307
I go and I kneel down in front of him.

01:53:31.307 --> 01:53:32.140
Listen to me.

01:53:33.727 --> 01:53:34.967
We are going to borrow your mother

01:53:34.967 --> 01:53:36.770
for a little bit longer.

01:53:38.177 --> 01:53:40.937
But I have a bit of homework for you.

01:53:40.937 --> 01:53:41.910
If that's okay?

01:53:43.937 --> 01:53:45.737
I hope this is not too presumptuous,

01:53:45.737 --> 01:53:48.967
but I have taken it upon myself to bring you a gift.

01:53:48.967 --> 01:53:50.775
This book is

01:53:51.792 --> 01:53:54.417
a collection of Zemnian fairy tales.

01:53:54.417 --> 01:53:55.667
SAM: Oh, not the creepy one.

01:53:55.667 --> 01:53:56.947
LIAM: Well, only some of them are creepy.

01:53:56.947 --> 01:53:58.067
Some of them are quite joyful.

01:53:58.067 --> 01:53:59.667
MATT: "Cool!"

01:53:59.667 --> 01:54:00.500
LIAM: I thought you would like them.

01:54:00.500 --> 01:54:01.484
TRAVIS: "Quite joyful."

01:54:03.001 --> 01:54:03.834
SAM: Zemnian joy.

01:54:03.834 --> 01:54:05.772
LIAM: I was raised on these.

01:54:05.772 --> 01:54:07.467
MARISHA: You get food.
LIAM: So that will pass the time

01:54:07.467 --> 01:54:09.317
in the place that you're going to be.

01:54:10.427 --> 01:54:12.367
Your mother will tell you.

01:54:12.367 --> 01:54:15.170
But this book is--

01:54:16.217 --> 01:54:18.027
it's probably a little too old for you,

01:54:18.027 --> 01:54:19.877
maybe in a year or two or three

01:54:19.877 --> 01:54:20.710
you will be ready for it--

01:54:20.710 --> 01:54:22.735
SAM: Tusk Love.
LIAM: But this is the book

01:54:24.027 --> 01:54:25.752
that I first started--

01:54:25.752 --> 01:54:27.493
(laughter)

01:54:27.493 --> 01:54:29.818
LIAM: -- to understand magic.

01:54:33.447 --> 01:54:34.280
MATT: "Mom, can I?"

01:54:36.117 --> 01:54:38.387
SAM: I mean, of course!

01:54:38.387 --> 01:54:39.845
MATT: Yeza's like--

01:54:42.417 --> 01:54:44.384
SAM: I'll leave it-- we'll leave it--

01:54:46.527 --> 01:54:49.520
When Yeza says it's appropriate,

01:54:50.547 --> 01:54:53.072
then you may take a peek.
MATT: "Exactly. Indeed."

01:54:53.072 --> 01:54:54.507
LIAM: I hand it down to Yeza, too, and say: Yes,

01:54:54.507 --> 01:54:55.807
this is in your father's care

01:54:55.807 --> 01:54:58.400
and when he deems you ready--

01:54:59.981 --> 01:55:01.927
MATT: Yeza leans in and takes the book and goes,

01:55:01.927 --> 01:55:06.137
"Then once you've earned the ability by being a good boy

01:55:06.137 --> 01:55:07.597
"and keeping your things clean

01:55:07.597 --> 01:55:11.717
"and not shooting me in the rear end

01:55:11.717 --> 01:55:14.797
"when I'm not paying attention or trying to get work done,

01:55:14.797 --> 01:55:17.677
"then maybe in time you can look at this magic book."

01:55:17.677 --> 01:55:19.577
LIAM: And then I really laser in on the boy

01:55:19.577 --> 01:55:21.140
and say: Yes, that is right.

01:55:22.197 --> 01:55:25.777
Your mother and father are very skilled individuals

01:55:25.777 --> 01:55:28.360
and a credit to the Empire.

01:55:29.317 --> 01:55:31.200
And you have a lot of potential.

01:55:33.297 --> 01:55:34.397
Just like your mother.

01:55:37.177 --> 01:55:39.090
So what I want you to do is study.

01:55:40.667 --> 01:55:41.680
And one day,

01:55:43.537 --> 01:55:45.792
if you like, if it's okay with you--

01:55:45.792 --> 01:55:47.280
looking at the father--

01:55:48.607 --> 01:55:49.850
If you want to learn,

01:55:52.327 --> 01:55:53.977
I hope you will come and find me.

01:55:56.767 --> 01:55:58.067
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

01:56:01.670 --> 01:56:02.570
LIAM: Where's the one?

01:56:05.867 --> 01:56:06.700
18.

01:56:06.700 --> 01:56:07.533
MATT: 18.

01:56:08.697 --> 01:56:10.877
For as much as he is an easily distracted child,

01:56:10.877 --> 01:56:13.607
he is entirely honed in on what you're saying

01:56:13.607 --> 01:56:15.100
and just nodding.

01:56:16.407 --> 01:56:17.240
"Okay."

01:56:18.347 --> 01:56:19.527
LIAM: And the first thing I will teach you

01:56:19.527 --> 01:56:22.317
is how to see little scamps like you

01:56:22.317 --> 01:56:24.000
the way I found you today.

01:56:24.947 --> 01:56:25.780
MATT: "Okay."

01:56:28.437 --> 01:56:31.107
LIAM: You be a good boy, you listen to your father.

01:56:31.107 --> 01:56:32.657
Your mother will join you soon.

01:56:34.407 --> 01:56:35.240
MATT: "Okay."

01:56:37.007 --> 01:56:38.157
LIAM: You're a family of the Empire,

01:56:38.157 --> 01:56:39.977
we have to keep you together.

01:56:39.977 --> 01:56:41.027
That is what matters.

01:56:45.826 --> 01:56:46.897
(laughter)

01:56:46.897 --> 01:56:49.476
MATT: Now he starts getting a little fiddly.

01:56:49.476 --> 01:56:50.917
SAM: Go hide, go hide!

01:56:50.917 --> 01:56:52.177
MATT: "Ah!" And he jumps off the bed again.

01:56:52.177 --> 01:56:53.160
LIAM: Where did he go?

01:56:54.047 --> 01:56:55.867
SAM: He's just too good.

01:56:55.867 --> 01:56:58.207
LIAM: Oh well. Hopefully I imparted my wisdom.

01:56:58.207 --> 01:57:00.437
MATT: You can hear him giggling under the bed.

01:57:00.437 --> 01:57:01.760
LIAM: I will see you someday!

01:57:04.777 --> 01:57:06.157
MATT: All right.
SAM: All right.

01:57:06.157 --> 01:57:07.787
LIAM: Then the act drops and I'm a heap again

01:57:07.787 --> 01:57:09.147
and I walk away from the room.

01:57:09.147 --> 01:57:10.467
MATT: Fair enough.

01:57:10.467 --> 01:57:11.347
While this is transpiring,

01:57:11.347 --> 01:57:14.837
the two of you have carefully coasted downstairs

01:57:14.837 --> 01:57:18.150
behind Bluud, blending into the environment.

01:57:21.437 --> 01:57:23.317
You're looking like you're helping bus tables

01:57:23.317 --> 01:57:26.510
which, as you're doing that,

01:57:27.487 --> 01:57:31.030
Carlos from behind the bar glances over and goes--

01:57:35.037 --> 01:57:37.707
puts it down and starts walking over towards you.

01:57:37.707 --> 01:57:38.551
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

01:57:38.551 --> 01:57:39.909
MATT: (laughs)

01:57:42.357 --> 01:57:43.846
Which--

01:57:43.846 --> 01:57:44.744
Hang on, there we go.

01:57:46.497 --> 01:57:48.355
"Hey, excuse me.

01:57:50.237 --> 01:57:51.697
"Who are you?"

01:57:51.697 --> 01:57:54.497
TRAVIS: Oh, I'm new. I'm new here.

01:57:54.497 --> 01:57:55.617
I'm just sort of--

01:57:55.617 --> 01:57:58.057
MATT: "I'm responsible for
all the hires of the establishment,

01:57:58.057 --> 01:57:59.087
"I have not met you before.

01:57:59.087 --> 01:58:00.157
"If you are going--"

01:58:00.157 --> 01:58:01.905
TRAVIS: Right, right.
MATT: "I need you to leave."

01:58:01.905 --> 01:58:03.457
(laughter)

01:58:03.457 --> 01:58:05.307
SAM: Just some weirdo who started busing tables.

01:58:05.307 --> 01:58:06.780
MATT: Yeah, this dude just walks in

01:58:06.780 --> 01:58:08.918
and he starts cleaning tables and taking shit.

01:58:08.918 --> 01:58:11.110
LIAM: Did you even fill out the application?

01:58:11.110 --> 01:58:12.750
TRAVIS: Are you hiring?

01:58:12.750 --> 01:58:14.791
(laughter)

01:58:14.791 --> 01:58:15.624
MATT: "What?

01:58:16.677 --> 01:58:19.034
"Not anymore, you can't just walk into an establishment

01:58:19.034 --> 01:58:20.637
"and start pretending like you work there!

01:58:20.637 --> 01:58:22.903
"Who do you think you are, Steven Spielberg?"

01:58:22.903 --> 01:58:24.414
(laughter)

01:58:24.414 --> 01:58:26.136
TALIESIN: Deep cut. Well done.
MARISHA: Deep cut, yeah.

01:58:26.136 --> 01:58:27.962
ASHLEY: Deep cut.
MARISHA: Good story.

01:58:27.962 --> 01:58:30.795
TRAVIS: Yeah. How did I get in here?

01:58:30.795 --> 01:58:33.940
And I'll just start walking the way I came from.

01:58:33.940 --> 01:58:35.605
MATT: (scoffs)

01:58:35.605 --> 01:58:36.955
"The nerve of some people!"

01:58:38.364 --> 01:58:39.623
(laughter)

01:58:39.623 --> 01:58:41.742
LAURA: (laughs) Back towards the stairs?

01:58:41.742 --> 01:58:43.118
MATT: You head back to the stairs, or you head out?

01:58:43.118 --> 01:58:44.360
TRAVIS: Yep, I'm totally fucked.

01:58:45.247 --> 01:58:47.504
MATT: As you head to the stairs, he goes, "Ah, ah, ah!

01:58:50.137 --> 01:58:52.957
"The front door?"
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah.

01:58:52.957 --> 01:58:57.492
Get turned around so easily. (clears throat)

01:58:57.492 --> 01:59:00.454
I start walking towards the exit.

01:59:00.454 --> 01:59:02.287
MATT: All right, as you start walking that way,

01:59:02.287 --> 01:59:05.597
are you finding a seat?

01:59:05.597 --> 01:59:07.371
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm trying to stay

01:59:07.371 --> 01:59:08.871
within maybe hearing distance,

01:59:08.871 --> 01:59:11.877
but definitely keeping a watch on everything.

01:59:11.877 --> 01:59:12.710
MATT: Okay.

01:59:14.197 --> 01:59:15.587
Now, as this is happening,

01:59:15.587 --> 01:59:18.027
Bluud is walking through the tables,

01:59:18.027 --> 01:59:19.877
getting an eye on everybody.

01:59:19.877 --> 01:59:21.390
Glancing back at you.

01:59:23.057 --> 01:59:27.597
Subtly walking around and walks towards the outside edge.

01:59:27.597 --> 01:59:29.497
And there's the main exit doorway,

01:59:29.497 --> 01:59:31.547
which you are being ushered towards

01:59:31.547 --> 01:59:34.767
as you see Bluud arcing around the side of it.

01:59:34.767 --> 01:59:37.260
And there's two individuals sitting,

01:59:38.107 --> 01:59:40.697
hoods up a little bit, tossed scarf around the side.

01:59:40.697 --> 01:59:42.090
You can see them both.

01:59:44.441 --> 01:59:45.274
From what you can tell, the light in here,

01:59:45.274 --> 01:59:46.736
nobody you recognize.

01:59:46.736 --> 01:59:50.777
They're both just-- have two drinks on the table,

01:59:50.777 --> 01:59:53.837
arms crossed and they're just settling there quietly,

01:59:53.837 --> 01:59:55.157
occasionally talking to each other

01:59:55.157 --> 01:59:57.840
and as Bluud approaches they glance up and look at him.

01:59:59.509 --> 02:00:00.650
Bluud leans in.

02:00:01.887 --> 02:00:03.687
Make a perception check.

02:00:03.687 --> 02:00:04.787
Both of you, actually.

02:00:07.607 --> 02:00:08.440
TALIESIN: 19.

02:00:09.427 --> 02:00:11.558
TRAVIS: 20 flat.

02:00:12.507 --> 02:00:14.777
MATT: With the 20 and your proximity to the door,

02:00:14.777 --> 02:00:17.297
you can just make out some of the conversation

02:00:17.297 --> 02:00:19.305
as you're making that way.

02:00:19.305 --> 02:00:20.420
Bluud leans in, says,

02:00:21.790 --> 02:00:23.757
"Haven't seen you round here before.

02:00:25.757 --> 02:00:27.897
"What's your business?"

02:00:27.897 --> 02:00:28.947
And one of them goes,

02:00:30.087 --> 02:00:32.540
"Oh, we're just passing through.

02:00:34.267 --> 02:00:39.180
"This is a place of drinking and sitting, right?"

02:00:40.160 --> 02:00:43.187
Bluud goes, "Yeah, but some of my patrons

02:00:43.187 --> 02:00:46.447
"don't take kindly to your stares.

02:00:46.447 --> 02:00:50.047
"So I ask again, do you have any particular business

02:00:50.047 --> 02:00:52.267
"or do you need to find drinks elsewhere?

02:00:52.267 --> 02:00:55.247
"We have patrons all over, we don't need to

02:00:57.997 --> 02:01:02.577
"take kindly to people who unsettle our usual clientele."

02:01:02.577 --> 02:01:06.407
TRAVIS: Do I recognize that accent from those two gentlemen?

02:01:06.407 --> 02:01:11.407
MATT: It sounds loosely Marquesian, maybe?

02:01:12.187 --> 02:01:13.537
Make an intelligence check.

02:01:15.667 --> 02:01:19.057
Actually, no, sorry, this would be insight.

02:01:19.057 --> 02:01:20.167
TRAVIS: That's a natural 20.

02:01:20.167 --> 02:01:21.501
SAM: Whoa!
LAURA: What?

02:01:21.501 --> 02:01:22.859
TRAVIS: For a 22.
ASHLEY: My god!

02:01:22.859 --> 02:01:24.439
MATT: For a 22.
SAM: Marquesian?

02:01:24.439 --> 02:01:25.369
MARISHA: What is happening?

02:01:31.967 --> 02:01:33.217
MATT: You have a little bit of experience

02:01:33.217 --> 02:01:35.717
with Marquesian and Marquesian-adjacent

02:01:35.717 --> 02:01:40.550
dialects and accents, as there is a strong

02:01:40.550 --> 02:01:41.949
element of that throughout

02:01:41.949 --> 02:01:43.167
the history of the Menagerie Coast

02:01:43.167 --> 02:01:44.837
and the cultural sharing of that space.

02:01:44.837 --> 02:01:47.237
And there are traders that do travel occasionally

02:01:47.237 --> 02:01:49.467
to and from Marquet that make their way

02:01:49.467 --> 02:01:51.507
to Port Damali growing up.

02:01:51.507 --> 02:01:52.687
This is a weird accent.

02:01:52.687 --> 02:01:55.447
It's Marquesian, but it's a little off.

02:01:55.447 --> 02:01:56.280
TRAVIS: Hmm.

02:01:59.058 --> 02:02:00.077
LIAM: Interesting.

02:02:01.077 --> 02:02:02.857
MATT: As Bluud begins to muscle in, arms on the table,

02:02:02.857 --> 02:02:06.700
and goes, "I'm going to ask you both to leave."

02:02:08.747 --> 02:02:10.890
And they both look at each other and one goes,

02:02:12.767 --> 02:02:14.317
"But we just want another drink."

02:02:16.477 --> 02:02:19.120
And Bluud leans up and goes,

02:02:19.120 --> 02:02:21.327
"Well, sorry to bother you.

02:02:21.327 --> 02:02:23.127
"Enjoy the rest of your day."

02:02:23.127 --> 02:02:27.330
And begins to make his way back to the stairs.

02:02:28.186 --> 02:02:29.107
SAM: Uh-oh.

02:02:29.107 --> 02:02:32.167
MATT: As you see Carlos over there going, "Go on!"

02:02:32.167 --> 02:02:33.000
TRAVIS: Sorry.
MATT: "Shoo!"

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:36.625
TRAVIS: Yeah, you sure you don't need any extra?

02:02:36.625 --> 02:02:39.987
(laughter)

02:02:39.987 --> 02:02:42.777
MATT: "Look, you already made a bad impression.

02:02:42.777 --> 02:02:44.052
"And I hate to have to make a scene

02:02:44.052 --> 02:02:45.377
"in front of all of my customers,

02:02:45.377 --> 02:02:48.277
"but this is a fine establishment, so."

02:02:48.277 --> 02:02:50.077
TRAVIS: The proper channels? All right.

02:02:50.077 --> 02:02:50.910
MATT: "Yes."

02:02:50.910 --> 02:02:52.690
TRAVIS: I appreciate your time, thank you.

02:02:54.227 --> 02:02:55.060
Good day.

02:02:55.060 --> 02:02:56.540
I don't have a hat.

02:02:56.540 --> 02:03:00.006
(laughter)

02:03:01.727 --> 02:03:05.691
TRAVIS: And I'll go to the door and just sort of--

02:03:05.691 --> 02:03:07.807
(laughter)

02:03:07.807 --> 02:03:08.947
ASHLEY: How nice outside.

02:03:08.947 --> 02:03:10.837
TRAVIS: Look at the weather.

02:03:10.837 --> 02:03:12.687
Turn around and see if I can make eye contact

02:03:12.687 --> 02:03:13.990
with Caduceus at all.

02:03:15.297 --> 02:03:16.647
MATT: It's a little hot, when you step out

02:03:16.647 --> 02:03:18.617
into the blaring the light of day,

02:03:18.617 --> 02:03:21.407
the light adjustment hit you kind of hard.

02:03:21.407 --> 02:03:23.327
You glance back into the interior

02:03:23.327 --> 02:03:25.298
while out in the daylight and it's very dark in there.

02:03:25.298 --> 02:03:26.131
TRAVIS: Fuck!

02:03:26.300 --> 02:03:27.809
TRAVIS: Dark bridge at 60 feet.

02:03:27.809 --> 02:03:29.960
(laughter)

02:03:29.960 --> 02:03:30.830
Cool.

02:03:30.830 --> 02:03:33.960
TALIESIN: I didn't see what they said,
but I saw them do the fingers.

02:03:33.960 --> 02:03:36.055
MATT: With your perception roll,

02:03:36.055 --> 02:03:39.520
you saw the change in physicality

02:03:39.520 --> 02:03:40.560
and you saw something.

02:03:40.560 --> 02:03:44.130
And you are very familiar with subtle, magical gestures,

02:03:44.130 --> 02:03:48.370
and while this itself was not implicitly a spell.

02:03:48.370 --> 02:03:51.350
This was a very practiced,

02:03:52.500 --> 02:03:53.840
nonchalant gesture

02:03:53.840 --> 02:03:57.406
that seemed to carry some sort of arcane connotation to it.

02:04:01.020 --> 02:04:04.310
SAM: I love Johnny bus boy Appleseed,

02:04:04.310 --> 02:04:08.769
who just goes around busing tables in various restaurants.

02:04:08.769 --> 02:04:10.560
(laughter)

02:04:10.560 --> 02:04:12.010
MATT: One day someone will--

02:04:12.010 --> 02:04:14.594
(laughter)

02:04:14.594 --> 02:04:15.777
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll--

02:04:15.777 --> 02:04:17.806
MATT: Just hear Incredible Hulk--
TALIESIN: Wherever there are sections to be bused--

02:04:17.806 --> 02:04:19.529
MATT: -- TV show music as he leaves.
TALIESIN: -- he's there.

02:04:19.529 --> 02:04:21.014
TRAVIS: ♪ (hums Jurassic Park theme tune) ♪

02:04:22.164 --> 02:04:24.370
SAM: Some say he still buses today.

02:04:24.370 --> 02:04:28.360
(laughter)

02:04:28.360 --> 02:04:30.230
TRAVIS: I'll make my way out of the doorway,

02:04:30.230 --> 02:04:32.550
and just out of sight around the corner.

02:04:32.550 --> 02:04:34.170
And I'll just shift back into my form

02:04:34.170 --> 02:04:35.003
and I'll--

02:04:36.252 --> 02:04:38.510
I'll stay just outside of the entrance.

02:04:38.510 --> 02:04:39.518
MATT: Okay, all right.

02:04:39.518 --> 02:04:42.130
So you sit back up against the edge there.

02:04:42.130 --> 02:04:42.963
You've got it.

02:04:43.950 --> 02:04:45.460
All right. Caduceus.

02:04:45.460 --> 02:04:47.800
You watch them both sitting.

02:04:47.800 --> 02:04:50.030
TALIESIN: They're not looking at me, though, are they?

02:04:50.030 --> 02:04:51.680
MATT: At the moment? No.

02:04:51.680 --> 02:04:53.110
But you also don't look like yourself either.

02:04:53.110 --> 02:04:54.210
TALIESIN: Yeah, just checking.

02:04:56.300 --> 02:04:59.527
MATT: They're both looking towards the stairs.

02:04:59.527 --> 02:05:02.290
At no point are

02:05:02.290 --> 02:05:05.770
both of them not trained in the direction of the staircase.

02:05:05.770 --> 02:05:07.060
Occasionally, one'll glance off

02:05:07.060 --> 02:05:09.450
and take in the surroundings.

02:05:09.450 --> 02:05:10.926
But they seem to be,

02:05:10.926 --> 02:05:15.033
for as casual as the clientele are here, they are focused.

02:05:16.240 --> 02:05:17.600
TALIESIN: And I can tell they definitely did

02:05:17.600 --> 02:05:20.270
some sort of magicky thingy.

02:05:20.270 --> 02:05:21.278
MATT: It seems to be.

02:05:21.278 --> 02:05:23.830
Bluud was getting very much in that

02:05:23.830 --> 02:05:25.660
"I don't want to have to throw you out physically,

02:05:25.660 --> 02:05:27.470
"but I'm about to" physicality,

02:05:27.470 --> 02:05:28.480
leaning over the table.

02:05:28.480 --> 02:05:31.063
And immediately after that gesture stood up,

02:05:32.040 --> 02:05:33.596
nodded and walked away.

02:05:33.596 --> 02:05:35.254
TALIESIN: I'm going to--

02:05:36.487 --> 02:05:39.060
I don't even think I got a drink, did I?

02:05:39.060 --> 02:05:40.260
MATT: No, you just sat down.

02:05:42.558 --> 02:05:45.050
TALIESIN: I think I'm just nonchalantly
going to walk back upstairs.

02:05:45.050 --> 02:05:45.883
MATT: Okay.

02:05:47.210 --> 02:05:49.490
MARISHA: Once he walks up and I see him

02:05:49.490 --> 02:05:50.323
out of the corner of the eye,

02:05:50.323 --> 02:05:54.863
I stop: Oh, it's Caduceus. What's up?
ASHLEY: Hey!

02:05:54.863 --> 02:05:57.040
MARISHA: What's up?
TALIESIN: We've got a problem downstairs.

02:05:57.040 --> 02:05:58.237
ASHLEY: What's wrong?

02:05:58.237 --> 02:06:01.653
TALIESIN: There's two guys down by the front door.

02:06:02.920 --> 02:06:03.950
MARISHA: Weird guys?

02:06:03.950 --> 02:06:05.280
TALIESIN: Yeah, they've got magic

02:06:05.280 --> 02:06:08.153
and they are waiting for us to come downstairs.

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:10.080
MARISHA: Weird guys with magic.

02:06:10.080 --> 02:06:11.520
TALIESIN: Weird guys with magic by the door

02:06:11.520 --> 02:06:14.562
and they are getting some bad vibes.

02:06:14.562 --> 02:06:16.340
ASHLEY: Should we just take care of it right now?

02:06:16.340 --> 02:06:18.040
TALIESIN: I am thinking--

02:06:19.430 --> 02:06:21.063
We're all kind of exhausted.

02:06:22.560 --> 02:06:26.093
I'm just thinking maybe we just shouldn't go downstairs.

02:06:29.660 --> 02:06:32.473
Fjord is outside, too, it's kind of complicated.

02:06:33.330 --> 02:06:34.890
I'm really not sure what to do about it,

02:06:34.890 --> 02:06:36.330
he tried to

02:06:37.770 --> 02:06:38.603
bus the table.

02:06:38.603 --> 02:06:40.343
I'm not entirely sure what happened.

02:06:41.578 --> 02:06:42.656
He kind of got thrown out.

02:06:42.656 --> 02:06:45.040
ASHLEY: Was he trying to be undercover by busing?

02:06:45.040 --> 02:06:46.748
TALIESIN: Yeah, it was not a--

02:06:46.748 --> 02:06:48.940
It was a bad call.

02:06:48.940 --> 02:06:50.596
(laughter)

02:06:50.596 --> 02:06:51.429
Really.

02:06:51.429 --> 02:06:56.065
(laughter)

02:06:56.065 --> 02:06:57.162
(laughter)

02:06:57.162 --> 02:06:58.628
TRAVIS: You're not wrong.

02:06:59.672 --> 02:07:00.863
TALIESIN: Kind of in an establishment

02:07:00.863 --> 02:07:03.100
it's the least inconspicuous thing you can do.

02:07:04.734 --> 02:07:07.396
It's the one person everyone recognizes, really,

02:07:07.396 --> 02:07:10.200
but he's learning.

02:07:10.200 --> 02:07:11.533
Aren't we all?
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:07:11.533 --> 02:07:16.115
(laughter)

02:07:16.115 --> 02:07:19.790
(laughter)

02:07:19.790 --> 02:07:21.530
TALIESIN: We should form some kind of plan

02:07:21.530 --> 02:07:22.480
because there are definitely

02:07:22.480 --> 02:07:24.243
people waiting for us downstairs.

02:07:25.090 --> 02:07:28.950
MARISHA: Do you think that they're related to the Assembly?

02:07:28.950 --> 02:07:30.500
TALIESIN: I've got a little bit of magic left,

02:07:30.500 --> 02:07:32.133
I've got some Hold Person.

02:07:33.265 --> 02:07:37.140
If we want to get at them from the front door,

02:07:37.140 --> 02:07:38.770
if we can get down there without using the stairs,

02:07:38.770 --> 02:07:41.660
we can just find out who they are and what they want.

02:07:41.660 --> 02:07:44.420
MARISHA: You didn't get any good visuals

02:07:44.420 --> 02:07:46.160
on what they look like, what they were wearing?

02:07:46.160 --> 02:07:48.613
TALIESIN: Well, what I saw was--

02:07:50.050 --> 02:07:51.615
You didn't actually give me a good--

02:07:51.615 --> 02:07:53.440
MATT: Right, fair enough.
TALIESIN: Guys in cloaks?

02:07:54.370 --> 02:07:56.673
MATT: Two gentlemen in cloaks.

02:07:57.588 --> 02:08:00.790
With heavy scarves around the shoulders

02:08:00.790 --> 02:08:02.460
with a hood that seems to be

02:08:02.460 --> 02:08:04.250
of a similar material to the scarf.

02:08:04.250 --> 02:08:09.198
Wearing casual, baggy, sleeveless, tunic-type attire.

02:08:09.198 --> 02:08:10.114
Wearing casual, baggy, sleeveless, tunic-type attire

02:08:10.114 --> 02:08:11.190
that's belted in the center

02:08:11.190 --> 02:08:13.540
with some baggier pants,

02:08:13.540 --> 02:08:17.790
and some knee-high boots with some tie straps

02:08:17.790 --> 02:08:19.160
around the top of it.

02:08:19.160 --> 02:08:20.860
They're both similar attire,

02:08:20.860 --> 02:08:22.180
but the designs and patterns,

02:08:22.180 --> 02:08:25.123
and wearing is not uniform, if you will.

02:08:26.580 --> 02:08:29.640
But they're nobody you recognize, necessarily.

02:08:29.640 --> 02:08:32.240
MARISHA: Doesn't sound like anybody from the Empire.

02:08:32.240 --> 02:08:34.090
TALIESIN: Well, it's not like we haven't

02:08:34.090 --> 02:08:36.210
pissed off an awful lot of people.

02:08:36.210 --> 02:08:38.010
MARISHA: Where are they sitting?

02:08:38.010 --> 02:08:41.170
TALIESIN: Right by the front door on the right side of it.

02:08:41.170 --> 02:08:42.530
If we're facing the front door,

02:08:42.530 --> 02:08:43.920
they're on the right side.

02:08:43.920 --> 02:08:45.050
MARISHA: Is there a way where I can

02:08:45.050 --> 02:08:48.111
get down low and just peek around the stairs, get a visual.

02:08:48.111 --> 02:08:49.161
MATT: Make a stealth check.

02:08:52.642 --> 02:08:54.233
MARISHA: That's okay. 18.

02:08:55.169 --> 02:08:57.090
MATT: 18, okay.

02:08:57.090 --> 02:09:00.880
You glance down, spider crawl down to the edge

02:09:00.880 --> 02:09:04.540
where the base part of the second floor

02:09:04.540 --> 02:09:06.370
and the opening at the top of the rail

02:09:06.370 --> 02:09:08.450
begins to peer down into the main area.

02:09:08.450 --> 02:09:09.813
And you peek in there.

02:09:10.790 --> 02:09:14.230
You can make out, based on what he's specified,

02:09:14.230 --> 02:09:15.440
the direction of the individuals,

02:09:15.440 --> 02:09:17.150
though they're a bit far to make out too many details.

02:09:17.150 --> 02:09:18.727
You can make perception check if you'd like to see.

02:09:18.727 --> 02:09:20.370
MARISHA: Are they talking?

02:09:20.370 --> 02:09:22.217
MATT: You'll find out.
LAURA: Or are they looking straight at you.

02:09:22.217 --> 02:09:23.652
MARISHA: At me.

02:09:23.652 --> 02:09:24.760
Oh yikes.

02:09:24.760 --> 02:09:26.280
Eight.

02:09:26.280 --> 02:09:27.610
MATT: Hard to see in here

02:09:29.210 --> 02:09:31.250
any specifics from this distance.

02:09:31.250 --> 02:09:32.083
Yeah.

02:09:34.960 --> 02:09:38.440
TALIESIN: I feel like we've burned ourselves out a bit.

02:09:38.440 --> 02:09:40.320
My thought is to come around the back

02:09:40.320 --> 02:09:42.790
and maybe try and have a contained conversation.

02:09:42.790 --> 02:09:45.550
I'd rather know who's trying to keep track than

02:09:46.620 --> 02:09:47.770
squash it at this point.

02:09:47.770 --> 02:09:50.230
Honestly, if they wanted to tell somebody where we were

02:09:50.230 --> 02:09:51.730
they've probably already done so.

02:09:54.160 --> 02:09:56.910
MARISHA: I really hope that this isn't related to

02:09:57.926 --> 02:10:00.020
a third party

02:10:00.020 --> 02:10:03.695
separate situation that we've pissed off along the way.

02:10:03.695 --> 02:10:05.050
It's just something else to deal with.

02:10:05.050 --> 02:10:07.170
TALIESIN: It feels inevitable, though, at this point

02:10:07.170 --> 02:10:08.420
that there's just not nearly

02:10:08.420 --> 02:10:10.530
enough moving parts to our current situation.

02:10:10.530 --> 02:10:11.550
MARISHA: Absolutely, and we should

02:10:11.550 --> 02:10:13.290
just add more layers to the cake of complication.

02:10:13.290 --> 02:10:14.930
TALIESIN: Do we owe somebody money or something,

02:10:14.930 --> 02:10:16.360
was it something about the boat?

02:10:16.360 --> 02:10:17.480
I'm not sure.

02:10:17.480 --> 02:10:19.020
MARISHA: Probably.

02:10:19.020 --> 02:10:20.930
You said they were wearing different,

02:10:20.930 --> 02:10:23.403
would I recognize where they came from?

02:10:24.640 --> 02:10:26.678
We didn't catch Marquesian, did we?

02:10:26.678 --> 02:10:27.511
TALIESIN: No.

02:10:27.511 --> 02:10:30.460
MATT: Especially not at your perception check.

02:10:30.460 --> 02:10:31.990
ASHLEY: I mean, they know we we're here,

02:10:31.990 --> 02:10:34.860
we could just go down there and--

02:10:34.860 --> 02:10:36.430
TALIESIN: That's why I was thinking we could go around.

02:10:36.430 --> 02:10:37.465
ASHLEY: Go around.

02:10:37.465 --> 02:10:38.910
TALIESIN: Have a little bit of a surprise,

02:10:38.910 --> 02:10:39.743
"Hey friends."

02:10:39.743 --> 02:10:42.420
So it doesn't have to be a thing, but

02:10:43.590 --> 02:10:44.503
let's have a talk.

02:10:45.860 --> 02:10:47.895
MATT: About this moment you both emerge.

02:10:47.895 --> 02:10:51.230
MARISHA: I was about to say let's alert the others.

02:10:51.230 --> 02:10:52.270
Hey.

02:10:52.270 --> 02:10:54.079
Perfect timing.

02:10:54.079 --> 02:10:55.380
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:10:55.380 --> 02:10:57.820
MARISHA: Fjord got kicked out of his disguise.
LAURA: Wait, what?

02:10:57.820 --> 02:11:00.153
MARISHA: Well, he got kicked out in his disguise,

02:11:00.153 --> 02:11:01.510
because of his disguise.
TALIESIN: It was a terrible disguise.

02:11:01.510 --> 02:11:02.594
LAURA: So where is he now?

02:11:02.594 --> 02:11:03.560
TALIESIN: Outside.

02:11:03.560 --> 02:11:04.501
LAURA: He's outside?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:11:04.501 --> 02:11:05.680
ASHLEY: I think they just were looking at him,

02:11:05.680 --> 02:11:07.720
and then they were like, "Who's this busboy,

02:11:07.720 --> 02:11:10.290
"he's not here-- he's never been here before."

02:11:10.290 --> 02:11:11.190
LAURA: He was a busboy?

02:11:12.124 --> 02:11:15.378
TALIESIN: More of a server.
ASHLEY: More of a server?

02:11:15.378 --> 02:11:16.797
TALIESIN: It was class.

02:11:16.797 --> 02:11:19.590
He had a thing so it was very serious.

02:11:19.590 --> 02:11:22.017
You don't want to go down
and get into it with one of the--

02:11:22.017 --> 02:11:23.210
ASHLEY: Oh.

02:11:23.210 --> 02:11:24.215
MARISHA: Beyond that.
TALIESIN: Not without an apron.

02:11:24.215 --> 02:11:25.048
If he had given himself an apron.

02:11:25.048 --> 02:11:27.873
LAURA: Can I look over the side of the--

02:11:27.873 --> 02:11:29.480
MARISHA: (stammering) Go ahead, go, wait.

02:11:29.480 --> 02:11:30.577
TALIESIN: No, no, no.

02:11:30.577 --> 02:11:32.585
LAURA: Wait, what?
TALIESIN: They're looking at the stairs.

02:11:32.585 --> 02:11:34.316
LAURA: They say, as I walk over to the stairs

02:11:34.316 --> 02:11:35.900
and get pulled back.

02:11:35.900 --> 02:11:37.077
SAM: How many of them are there?

02:11:37.077 --> 02:11:38.970
TALIESIN: Two, they are magic users.

02:11:38.970 --> 02:11:40.260
SAM: Let's just go fuck them up.

02:11:40.260 --> 02:11:42.796
TALIESIN: Let's not fuck anybody up right now.

02:11:42.796 --> 02:11:45.860
(laughter)

02:11:45.860 --> 02:11:46.960
SAM: I'll call out my son.

02:11:48.375 --> 02:11:50.191
LAURA: What is happening? What?

02:11:50.191 --> 02:11:52.468
TALIESIN: We are not starting a fight in your mom's house.

02:11:52.468 --> 02:11:54.050
LAURA: So wait. There's still people downstairs,

02:11:54.050 --> 02:11:55.920
Bluud didn't close the bar down.

02:11:55.920 --> 02:12:00.913
TALIESIN: He seemed to get
enchanted into leaving them alone.

02:12:00.913 --> 02:12:01.746
ASHLEY: Oh.

02:12:02.850 --> 02:12:04.060
TALIESIN: That's the vibe I got.

02:12:04.060 --> 02:12:06.828
He was in their face and then suddenly everything was fine.

02:12:06.828 --> 02:12:07.920
LAURA: I'm going to turn myself--

02:12:07.920 --> 02:12:09.430
I'm going to back up against the wall

02:12:09.430 --> 02:12:11.060
and turn myself invisible.

02:12:11.060 --> 02:12:12.660
MATT: Okay.
SAM: Oh, I'll do the same.

02:12:13.690 --> 02:12:14.770
LAURA: And just after I do that

02:12:14.770 --> 02:12:17.820
I'm going to walk over to the edge and look over.

02:12:17.820 --> 02:12:19.480
TALIESIN: I think if we can get outside

02:12:19.480 --> 02:12:20.570
and come around the front door,

02:12:20.570 --> 02:12:22.690
maybe we can talk to these people.

02:12:22.690 --> 02:12:25.783
Without having to start anything in your mom's house.

02:12:26.740 --> 02:12:28.930
LIAM: I don't know where you are, if your mother is ready.

02:12:28.930 --> 02:12:30.555
Do you think she'd be ready to go out the back

02:12:30.555 --> 02:12:32.420
and we could just leave?

02:12:32.420 --> 02:12:35.080
SAM: Oh, you mean without causing a ruckus?

02:12:35.080 --> 02:12:36.983
TALIESIN: It's a shame. I'd like to know
who's messing with us.

02:12:36.983 --> 02:12:38.040
MARISHA: I would, too.

02:12:38.040 --> 02:12:40.030
SAM: How can we get out of here that fast?

02:12:40.030 --> 02:12:41.683
Can you teleport 10 people?

02:12:42.600 --> 02:12:44.830
LIAM: Not today.

02:12:44.830 --> 02:12:46.120
SAM: Then we got to get rid of these people,

02:12:46.120 --> 02:12:47.440
or find a new place to sleep.

02:12:47.440 --> 02:12:48.872
TALIESIN: Yeah, we can't sleep here.

02:12:48.872 --> 02:12:50.493
MARISHA: I didn't get into--
LIAM: Card tricks.

02:12:50.493 --> 02:12:51.842
(laughter)

02:12:51.842 --> 02:12:53.515
MARISHA: -- any scuffles.
SAM: Huh, what?

02:12:53.515 --> 02:12:55.370
MARISHA: I didn't get into any scuffles,

02:12:55.370 --> 02:12:56.590
I am actually pretty great.

02:12:56.590 --> 02:12:58.400
So is Yasha.
TALIESIN: I'm pretty medium.

02:12:58.400 --> 02:13:01.490
LAURA: Yeah, my invisibility only lasts for six seconds,

02:13:01.490 --> 02:13:04.120
so I'm literally just walking up to the edge

02:13:04.120 --> 02:13:06.680
of the banister and looking over as fast as I can.

02:13:06.680 --> 02:13:09.203
And looking down, and seeing what I can see.

02:13:09.203 --> 02:13:10.036
MATT: Okay.

02:13:10.036 --> 02:13:13.190
LAURA: I want to see if Bluud is at least talking to Carlos,

02:13:13.190 --> 02:13:16.170
and I want to get a look at the people

02:13:16.170 --> 02:13:17.333
that are looking at us.

02:13:18.750 --> 02:13:21.432
MATT: Bluud, right now, is not talking to Carlos,

02:13:21.432 --> 02:13:23.300
and is actually now heading back up the stairs.

02:13:23.300 --> 02:13:24.223
LAURA: What the fuck?!

02:13:25.341 --> 02:13:27.886
What about the two dudes watching us?

02:13:27.886 --> 02:13:29.389
Are they just staring up the stairs?

02:13:29.389 --> 02:13:30.340
MATT: Yep, they're just watching.

02:13:30.340 --> 02:13:32.170
LAURA: Can they see me invisible?

02:13:32.170 --> 02:13:33.470
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:13:34.530 --> 02:13:36.321
SAM: Very fast one.

02:13:36.321 --> 02:13:37.751
TALIESIN: Do something crude.

02:13:37.751 --> 02:13:38.662
LAURA: 11.

02:13:38.662 --> 02:13:40.437
MATT: 11, hard to tell.

02:13:40.437 --> 02:13:42.867
LAURA: I don't know what this was, but.

02:13:42.867 --> 02:13:45.210
TALIESIN: That would make me
do something if I were watching.

02:13:45.210 --> 02:13:47.060
LAURA: I back up.
LIAM: Invisible panic.

02:13:47.060 --> 02:13:48.170
ASHLEY: They would've seen that.

02:13:48.170 --> 02:13:50.903
SAM: Why don't we get Fjord back in here?

02:13:52.820 --> 02:13:54.710
By the way, I'm over here, guys.

02:13:54.710 --> 02:13:55.780
I'll be invisible,

02:13:55.780 --> 02:13:57.250
I'll just go down there and hang out

02:13:57.250 --> 02:13:58.820
in case shit goes down.

02:13:58.820 --> 02:14:01.660
But you, or Fjord or Jester

02:14:01.660 --> 02:14:03.390
can go talk to these gentle folk,

02:14:03.390 --> 02:14:05.510
and try to usher them along their merry way.

02:14:05.510 --> 02:14:06.810
And if it doesn't go well,

02:14:07.730 --> 02:14:08.750
shit goes down.

02:14:08.750 --> 02:14:09.960
MARISHA: All right, how about this?

02:14:09.960 --> 02:14:11.640
Is there a window on the side

02:14:11.640 --> 02:14:14.373
that I can scale down go around and get Fjord?

02:14:15.806 --> 02:14:17.450
SAM: I could just message him.

02:14:17.450 --> 02:14:19.640
MATT: Up the staircase there is a small window,

02:14:19.640 --> 02:14:22.020
that's on the upper left-hand side of the wall

02:14:22.020 --> 02:14:24.670
that it hugs along this side,

02:14:24.670 --> 02:14:26.260
or there is the window in the balcony

02:14:26.260 --> 02:14:28.220
in the Ruby of the Sea's room. In Marion's room.

02:14:28.220 --> 02:14:30.686
LIAM: Do you want to talk to Fjord?
Is that what you're wondering?

02:14:30.686 --> 02:14:31.770
MARISHA: I just figure we might as well

02:14:31.770 --> 02:14:33.920
have people flanking the situation.

02:14:33.920 --> 02:14:35.620
I can go around and meet up with Fjord,

02:14:35.620 --> 02:14:38.860
we can man the front, come in that way,

02:14:38.860 --> 02:14:40.820
if you guys want to come around this way.

02:14:40.820 --> 02:14:42.611
LIAM: Just in case, I mean,

02:14:42.611 --> 02:14:44.044
I pray we don't start a fight

02:14:44.044 --> 02:14:45.505
in the middle of Jester's home.
LAURA: Please, let's not.

02:14:45.505 --> 02:14:46.355
TALIESIN: Hopefully not.

02:14:46.355 --> 02:14:48.807
LAURA: We really-- It was rough in there, okay?

02:14:48.807 --> 02:14:49.706
MARISHA: I don't want to start a fight,

02:14:49.706 --> 02:14:52.170
but I do want to know who is following us.

02:14:52.170 --> 02:14:55.310
If there's another third party group,

02:14:55.310 --> 02:14:57.110
or entity, or someone else who wants us dead,

02:14:57.110 --> 02:14:58.050
I'd kind of like to know.

02:14:58.050 --> 02:15:00.741
LIAM: I would recommend that

02:15:00.741 --> 02:15:02.149
Fjord and Caduceus go talk to them,

02:15:02.149 --> 02:15:05.260
because, between his insight

02:15:05.260 --> 02:15:06.810
and this one's silver tongue,

02:15:06.810 --> 02:15:10.510
I think maybe we can have the best chance of learning.

02:15:10.510 --> 02:15:12.893
MARISHA: Let me go get Fjord.

02:15:14.050 --> 02:15:16.680
TALIESIN: You can sit by the door in case things get weird.

02:15:16.680 --> 02:15:17.513
MARISHA: Exactly.

02:15:17.513 --> 02:15:18.645
LAURA: Can you send a message to Fjord

02:15:18.645 --> 02:15:20.910
and let him know that Beau's coming?

02:15:20.910 --> 02:15:23.320
SAM: I can't, I will lose my Invisibility,

02:15:23.320 --> 02:15:24.380
but he can.
LAURA: Okay.

02:15:24.380 --> 02:15:26.530
LIAM: I pull out the wire.

02:15:26.530 --> 02:15:27.820
I hear that you are a busboy,

02:15:27.820 --> 02:15:28.690
I don't know what that means,

02:15:28.690 --> 02:15:30.943
but we are sending Beauregard out to talk to you.

02:15:32.170 --> 02:15:34.380
TRAVIS: Sounds good, the two people at the table

02:15:34.380 --> 02:15:38.700
had Marquesian-ish accents, they charmed Bluud.

02:15:40.420 --> 02:15:41.253
TALIESIN: What?

02:15:41.253 --> 02:15:43.300
LIAM: I relay that to the group,

02:15:43.300 --> 02:15:45.800
he said something about the people downstairs.

02:15:45.800 --> 02:15:50.300
Marquesian accents and they charmed your minotaur friend.

02:15:50.300 --> 02:15:51.840
LAURA: Does that sound like anything

02:15:51.840 --> 02:15:53.440
that would sound familiar to us?

02:15:54.850 --> 02:15:56.330
MATT: You've come across many

02:15:56.330 --> 02:15:58.890
different people of Marquesian background,

02:15:58.890 --> 02:16:01.730
doesn't strike anything directly.

02:16:01.730 --> 02:16:03.613
You'd probably have to get closer and converse with them,

02:16:03.613 --> 02:16:05.780
before you'd able to pick up anything like that.

02:16:05.780 --> 02:16:08.200
MARISHA: All right, give me two minutes

02:16:08.200 --> 02:16:11.875
and then we can walk up on them at the same time.

02:16:11.875 --> 02:16:12.708
LIAM: Sarsaparilla.

02:16:12.708 --> 02:16:14.694
TALIESIN: I'm going to open with talking.

02:16:14.694 --> 02:16:16.890
MARISHA: Open with talking.
TALIESIN: All right.

02:16:16.890 --> 02:16:18.740
MARISHA: I'm going to slink out one of the side windows,

02:16:18.740 --> 02:16:21.590
slide down, loop around, and grab Fjord.

02:16:21.590 --> 02:16:23.430
MATT: Okay, easy enough to do that

02:16:23.430 --> 02:16:25.520
with your crazy monk skills.

02:16:25.520 --> 02:16:27.390
But yeah, you manage to scale down the wall,

02:16:27.390 --> 02:16:31.850
drop down into the outside pseudo-alleyway,

02:16:31.850 --> 02:16:33.960
and then scoot around to find Fjord waiting

02:16:33.960 --> 02:16:35.693
on the outside of the front.

02:16:35.693 --> 02:16:36.948
TRAVIS: I got kicked out.

02:16:36.948 --> 02:16:38.980
MARISHA: I heard. Sorry, man.

02:16:38.980 --> 02:16:40.180
That's rough, buddy.

02:16:40.180 --> 02:16:41.550
TRAVIS: I was very polite.

02:16:41.550 --> 02:16:42.383
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:16:43.390 --> 02:16:45.610
It wasn't a bad idea, it really wasn't.

02:16:45.610 --> 02:16:48.898
TRAVIS: I know it doesn't really count, but I feel rejected.

02:16:49.930 --> 02:16:50.920
MARISHA: Well, you were

02:16:52.370 --> 02:16:54.162
in, you know, a few ways.

02:16:54.162 --> 02:16:54.995
TRAVIS: I can make it--

02:16:54.995 --> 02:16:56.645
Carlos and I, we'll come to an understanding.

02:16:56.645 --> 02:16:57.478
MARISHA: It's fine.

02:16:58.436 --> 02:17:03.050
So the rest of the group wants you to be the front man,

02:17:03.050 --> 02:17:04.960
the face, maybe talk to these--

02:17:04.960 --> 02:17:06.320
TRAVIS: Sorry, what, I was still thinking about Carlos,

02:17:06.320 --> 02:17:07.230
what'd you say?

02:17:07.230 --> 02:17:09.300
MARISHA: Wow, I've never seen you so dejected

02:17:09.300 --> 02:17:11.000
about this whole situation.

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:12.710
Wow, it really messed you up.

02:17:12.710 --> 02:17:13.620
TRAVIS: Slap me.

02:17:13.620 --> 02:17:14.970
MARISHA: Pop!

02:17:14.970 --> 02:17:18.700
Ooh sorry, I didn't have to go so hard.

02:17:18.700 --> 02:17:20.234
MATT: Nose is a little to the left.

02:17:20.234 --> 02:17:22.630
TRAVIS: Yeah. It's good.

02:17:22.630 --> 02:17:23.960
What was the plan?

02:17:23.960 --> 02:17:25.330
MARISHA: They want you to talk to these guys,

02:17:25.330 --> 02:17:26.340
they want you to be the face.

02:17:26.340 --> 02:17:27.950
TRAVIS: Yes, I'm down.
MARISHA: Okay.

02:17:27.950 --> 02:17:29.557
TRAVIS: Who else is in the room?

02:17:29.557 --> 02:17:32.314
MARISHA: I don't think-- I think-- well.

02:17:32.314 --> 02:17:33.640
the guy who kicked you out,

02:17:33.640 --> 02:17:34.500
Carlos.

02:17:34.500 --> 02:17:35.817
TRAVIS: No, of our group?

02:17:35.817 --> 02:17:37.260
What, just you and me?

02:17:37.260 --> 02:17:40.370
MARISHA: No, they're going to flank, we're going to--

02:17:40.370 --> 02:17:41.958
TRAVIS: Oh, converge?
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

02:17:41.958 --> 02:17:43.257
TRAVIS: Yeah!
MARISHA: Come out of the shadows.

02:17:43.257 --> 02:17:44.748
TRAVIS: I like it.
MARISHA: Cut 'em off.

02:17:44.748 --> 02:17:47.170
TRAVIS: Do we have a go word, or are we just going now?

02:17:47.170 --> 02:17:48.560
MARISHA: Apparently it was sarsaparilla,

02:17:48.560 --> 02:17:51.860
but I don't know if I'm waiting for that cue.

02:17:51.860 --> 02:17:56.183
Because they keep separating people who can't send messages.

02:17:56.183 --> 02:17:57.850
TRAVIS: Yeah, we can't send anything.

02:17:57.850 --> 02:18:00.280
MARISHA: I can't send shit, this keeps happening.

02:18:00.280 --> 02:18:01.521
I keep pointing it out and it just keeps happening.

02:18:01.521 --> 02:18:03.180
TRAVIS: Do you want to count to 20 and then we go?

02:18:03.180 --> 02:18:04.013
MARISHA: Sure.

02:18:04.013 --> 02:18:07.051
TRAVIS: One, two, three, four.

02:18:07.051 --> 02:18:09.254
SAM: I'm going to start making my way down the stairs.

02:18:09.254 --> 02:18:10.522
MARISHA, LIAM, ASHLEY, LAURA: ♪ Making my way downstairs. ♪

02:18:10.522 --> 02:18:11.820
SAM: Uh-huh.

02:18:11.820 --> 02:18:12.653
Hiding.

02:18:14.300 --> 02:18:17.830
LAURA: I'm going to cast Disguise Self.

02:18:17.830 --> 02:18:18.930
SAM: 34.

02:18:18.930 --> 02:18:20.480
MATT: 34, all right.

02:18:20.480 --> 02:18:21.530
LAURA: And I'm going to

02:18:23.470 --> 02:18:26.388
look like my mom.

02:18:26.388 --> 02:18:27.268
MATT: Okay.

02:18:27.268 --> 02:18:28.670
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:18:28.670 --> 02:18:29.503
TALIESIN: All right.

02:18:29.503 --> 02:18:33.030
LAURA: In her casual, coming down, midday,

02:18:33.030 --> 02:18:34.863
you know, attire.

02:18:36.670 --> 02:18:37.503
MATT: All right.

02:18:39.025 --> 02:18:40.690
So you're stealthing down; what'd you roll?

02:18:40.690 --> 02:18:41.523
SAM: 34.

02:18:41.523 --> 02:18:43.170
MATT: 34, all right.

02:18:43.170 --> 02:18:44.740
Ever so quietly.

02:18:44.740 --> 02:18:47.343
And you begin to stroll down as Marion

02:18:47.343 --> 02:18:49.705
A handful of the patrons, "Oh!"

02:18:49.705 --> 02:18:50.813
and whisper at each other.

02:18:50.813 --> 02:18:52.740
And straighten up in their seats,

02:18:52.740 --> 02:18:56.433
and give a nod as you make your way down the stairs.

02:18:58.985 --> 02:19:00.402
MARISHA: 18.

02:19:00.402 --> 02:19:02.398
MARISHA and TRAVIS: 19, 20.

02:19:02.398 --> 02:19:03.239
All good.

02:19:04.156 --> 02:19:05.052
We go in.
MATT: All right,

02:19:05.052 --> 02:19:07.770
you both enter the chamber.

02:19:07.770 --> 02:19:10.023
As you're walking down, you're stealthing in there.

02:19:10.023 --> 02:19:12.056
What are the rest of you doing?
TALIESIN: I'm walking down as well.

02:19:12.056 --> 02:19:13.781
MATT: Okay.
ASHLEY: I'm walking down.

02:19:13.781 --> 02:19:14.976
LIAM: I'm staying at the top of the stairs,

02:19:14.976 --> 02:19:18.353
out of view, just listening because I'm fucking tapped.

02:19:19.878 --> 02:19:20.711
MATT: Okay.

02:19:22.550 --> 02:19:26.793
As both of you enter from that side--

02:19:28.010 --> 02:19:29.550
And you were just looking like yourself, right?

02:19:29.550 --> 02:19:31.370
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.
MARISHA: Same.

02:19:31.370 --> 02:19:35.270
MATT: Both of the figures stand up.

02:19:35.270 --> 02:19:36.390
TRAVIS: Stand up from their chairs?

02:19:36.390 --> 02:19:37.223
MATT: Mm-hmm.

02:19:38.870 --> 02:19:39.703
MARISHA: I just

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:42.380
clench my fists,

02:19:42.380 --> 02:19:43.213
go on guard.

02:19:43.213 --> 02:19:44.493
TALIESIN: I'm going to walk down.

02:19:46.008 --> 02:19:47.350
What are they drinking?

02:19:48.470 --> 02:19:50.880
MATT: You don't see, just two--

02:19:52.370 --> 02:19:55.052
It's like clay mugs of some kind.

02:19:55.052 --> 02:19:57.152
TALIESIN: All right, I'm going to walk down and--

02:19:58.560 --> 02:19:59.393
May I?

02:20:00.620 --> 02:20:02.420
MATT: As you're approaching,

02:20:02.420 --> 02:20:04.330
because they've stood up as these two entered

02:20:04.330 --> 02:20:06.200
and over that space.

02:20:06.200 --> 02:20:07.600
And so as you guys are all walking in

02:20:07.600 --> 02:20:09.300
you can see them both standing up.

02:20:10.930 --> 02:20:15.132
They both began heading towards the door.

02:20:15.132 --> 02:20:16.825
MARISHA: I step in front of the door.
TALIESIN: Thaumaturgy.

02:20:16.825 --> 02:20:18.960
LIAM: (whispering) Yes.
TALIESIN: Doors shut.

02:20:18.960 --> 02:20:21.570
MARISHA: I reach behind me, click, click.

02:20:21.570 --> 02:20:22.940
Just lock the door.

02:20:22.940 --> 02:20:24.373
TALIESIN: Just want a conversation.

02:20:26.500 --> 02:20:27.890
We are very--

02:20:31.060 --> 02:20:32.680
Anything I say is going to be threatening,

02:20:32.680 --> 02:20:33.968
it's been a lot today,

02:20:33.968 --> 02:20:36.660
and I'm frankly tired of hurting people.

02:20:36.660 --> 02:20:38.177
MATT: Some of the other patrons are like,

02:20:38.177 --> 02:20:39.488
"What's what's going on?

02:20:39.488 --> 02:20:40.870
And start talking.

02:20:40.870 --> 02:20:42.460
"What's going on?"

02:20:42.460 --> 02:20:45.852
And Carlos is like, "May I ask why the door is closed?"

02:20:45.852 --> 02:20:47.613
LAURA: (like Marion) Carlos, dear.

02:20:48.810 --> 02:20:50.243
Don't worry about it.

02:20:51.240 --> 02:20:53.380
Come, I need to talk to you.

02:20:53.380 --> 02:20:54.213
It's important.

02:20:56.744 --> 02:20:59.344
MATT: Make a deception check with advantage.

02:21:00.744 --> 02:21:02.385
LAURA: Ooh, okay.

02:21:02.385 --> 02:21:03.463
SAM: So many dice.

02:21:03.463 --> 02:21:06.550
LAURA: I know, I was looking for my advantage dice.

02:21:06.550 --> 02:21:09.483
Oh, oh! Ho, ho, ho, ha, ho, hih!

02:21:09.483 --> 02:21:10.966
Mmkay.
MATT: That was a ride.

02:21:12.750 --> 02:21:13.583
LAURA: 25.

02:21:14.710 --> 02:21:16.000
MATT: He's looking confused over there,

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.890
but begins to walk with you.

02:21:18.890 --> 02:21:20.035
TALIESIN: Can I get you a drink?

02:21:20.035 --> 02:21:21.820
Do you need a refill?

02:21:21.820 --> 02:21:23.150
MATT: "No drink,"

02:21:23.150 --> 02:21:25.280
and the other one looks to the other figure,

02:21:25.280 --> 02:21:27.590
you see that they're different heights.

02:21:27.590 --> 02:21:29.990
And the smaller one just leans forward and goes,

02:21:31.457 --> 02:21:35.961
"Look, there is no conflict to be had here.

02:21:37.615 --> 02:21:42.240
"We are just trying to convey message to Bren."

02:21:42.240 --> 02:21:43.073
TRAVIS: To Bren?

02:21:43.073 --> 02:21:45.630
MATT: And it's this point you recognize the voice.

02:21:45.630 --> 02:21:47.210
Speaking in a

02:21:48.084 --> 02:21:50.417
Dwendalian Zemnian accent.

02:21:50.417 --> 02:21:51.250
LIAM: There it is.

02:21:51.250 --> 02:21:52.403
MATT: A female voice.

02:21:53.650 --> 02:21:56.639
Something you've heard before at a dinner table.

02:21:56.639 --> 02:21:58.000
LAURA: (gasps)

02:21:58.000 --> 02:21:58.833
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

02:22:03.430 --> 02:22:06.410
MATT: "We have been dispatched to

02:22:08.850 --> 02:22:10.163
"cut you all off.

02:22:13.970 --> 02:22:14.880
"We are here to

02:22:16.245 --> 02:22:18.920
"let you know in the short time we have

02:22:18.920 --> 02:22:20.853
"that you need to go."

02:22:23.547 --> 02:22:24.380
TRAVIS: Where?

02:22:24.380 --> 02:22:26.360
MATT: "<i>Anywhere</i> but here.

02:22:28.389 --> 02:22:31.640
"If there's anyone important to you,

02:22:31.640 --> 02:22:33.415
"leave with them."

02:22:35.514 --> 02:22:36.870
They both look a little nervous,

02:22:36.870 --> 02:22:37.790
and the other one, the bigger one

02:22:37.790 --> 02:22:39.570
is looking a little impatient.

02:22:39.570 --> 02:22:40.403
"(frustrated grunt)"

02:22:43.370 --> 02:22:44.750
The smaller one goes,

02:22:47.835 --> 02:22:48.960
"Trent is...

02:22:53.325 --> 02:22:54.816
"frustrated.

02:22:57.270 --> 02:22:58.270
"And

02:22:59.410 --> 02:23:00.780
"beyond this

02:23:03.820 --> 02:23:05.163
"brief little straying,

02:23:06.430 --> 02:23:08.320
"it's the most we can help you with

02:23:08.320 --> 02:23:10.570
"without putting ourselves in too much danger.

02:23:11.820 --> 02:23:12.770
"We were never here.

02:23:15.110 --> 02:23:17.000
"And I hope we don't meet again."

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.080
TRAVIS: You weren't sent by Trent?

02:23:19.080 --> 02:23:19.913
MATT: "We were.

02:23:21.140 --> 02:23:23.303
"But we haven't arrived yet."

02:23:24.959 --> 02:23:27.922
TRAVIS: Understood. Just Nicodranas?

02:23:27.922 --> 02:23:29.133
Or is he coming here?

02:23:30.217 --> 02:23:31.400
MATT: "Oh, he has a

02:23:32.538 --> 02:23:34.723
"conversation to deal with,

02:23:34.723 --> 02:23:36.402
"a break-in at the sanatorium

02:23:37.260 --> 02:23:39.890
"to explain away what was done

02:23:39.890 --> 02:23:41.640
"without drawing too much suspicion."

02:23:43.355 --> 02:23:44.980
TRAVIS: You know, it was odd.

02:23:46.170 --> 02:23:48.310
It was on your advice that we

02:23:48.310 --> 02:23:51.320
made the attempt that we did at the time that we did.

02:23:51.320 --> 02:23:52.503
Yet, there he was.

02:23:54.590 --> 02:23:56.140
MATT: "I don't know what went wrong.

02:23:58.830 --> 02:24:01.513
"I didn't set you up, if that's what you're insinuating."

02:24:02.620 --> 02:24:03.710
TRAVIS: Do I believe her?

02:24:03.710 --> 02:24:04.910
MATT: Make an insight check.

02:24:07.450 --> 02:24:09.850
TALIESIN: I'll take that as well since I'm sitting there.

02:24:09.850 --> 02:24:10.856
TRAVIS: It's a 16.

02:24:10.856 --> 02:24:12.460
MATT: 16.

02:24:12.460 --> 02:24:13.703
TALIESIN: 20.
MATT: 20.

02:24:16.190 --> 02:24:18.970
Through the illusion, which is its own unique layer

02:24:18.970 --> 02:24:22.550
of adjusting to the circumstance.

02:24:22.550 --> 02:24:24.210
It's a little hard to tell,

02:24:24.210 --> 02:24:28.640
but it sounds like there is

02:24:28.640 --> 02:24:31.146
a ring of truth to what she's saying.

02:24:32.520 --> 02:24:33.420
TRAVIS: You came here,

02:24:35.307 --> 02:24:36.140
in this place.

02:24:37.970 --> 02:24:39.440
MATT: "One of the surviving guards

02:24:39.440 --> 02:24:44.110
"had said there was a connection with those that broke-in.

02:24:44.110 --> 02:24:45.860
"And so it was assumed this would be

02:24:46.910 --> 02:24:49.643
"a likely place of arrival."

02:24:51.138 --> 02:24:52.913
TALIESIN: We do appreciate the warning.

02:24:55.190 --> 02:24:56.745
Would you be willing to let us,

02:24:56.745 --> 02:24:59.030
I don't know if we can even do this right now,

02:24:59.030 --> 02:25:02.110
but if we can wipe us ourselves from your mind

02:25:02.110 --> 02:25:04.210
would you be willing to let us do that?

02:25:04.210 --> 02:25:05.960
MATT: At this point, you see the other one steps back,

02:25:05.960 --> 02:25:08.552
and goes, "I apologize, no."

02:25:09.400 --> 02:25:11.493
TALIESIN: Just a precaution for you, to be honest.

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:14.560
MATT: "There's nothing you could wipe from our minds

02:25:14.560 --> 02:25:18.910
"that would absolve us of anything."

02:25:18.910 --> 02:25:20.830
TALIESIN: We never saw them come in.

02:25:20.830 --> 02:25:22.500
TRAVIS: I understand your apprehension.

02:25:22.500 --> 02:25:24.520
You, your motivation,

02:25:24.520 --> 02:25:26.750
the one that sounds like Astrid, I understand.

02:25:26.750 --> 02:25:31.263
You, however, why are you helping us?

02:25:32.117 --> 02:25:33.425
MATT: "I'm not helping you.

02:25:34.522 --> 02:25:35.463
"I'm helping him,"

02:25:35.463 --> 02:25:38.977
and she just gestures up towards the rest of the building.

02:25:41.340 --> 02:25:42.600
TALIESIN: For what it's worth,

02:25:44.400 --> 02:25:45.580
his intentions are good,

02:25:45.580 --> 02:25:48.950
and if things were different,

02:25:50.170 --> 02:25:52.551
we would be asking for your help.

02:25:52.551 --> 02:25:53.790
MATT: (as Astrid) "But they aren't different,

02:25:53.790 --> 02:25:55.680
"and our intentions are not good.

02:25:55.680 --> 02:25:57.300
"So you have to go."

02:25:57.300 --> 02:25:58.133
TALIESIN: Thank you.

02:26:00.215 --> 02:26:04.090
MATT: They both begin to muscle their way past you, Beau,

02:26:04.090 --> 02:26:05.340
to try and open the door.

02:26:07.856 --> 02:26:11.110
MARISHA: I shoulder check them a little bit as I step aside.

02:26:11.110 --> 02:26:13.230
TALIESIN: I'm going to just head upstairs.

02:26:13.230 --> 02:26:15.710
MATT: Okay, they exit out the front.

02:26:15.710 --> 02:26:17.920
SAM: I'll trail them in my invisible form.

02:26:17.920 --> 02:26:19.410
Just to see which way they go.

02:26:19.410 --> 02:26:20.759
MARISHA: Yes.
MATT: Okay.

02:26:20.759 --> 02:26:21.592
MARISHA: Get it.

02:26:21.592 --> 02:26:23.440
SAM: Keeping distance.

02:26:23.440 --> 02:26:24.350
MATT: Fair enough.

02:26:24.350 --> 02:26:26.513
TALIESIN: Gather everyone, we have to leave right now.

02:26:27.560 --> 02:26:29.010
We go right now.

02:26:29.010 --> 02:26:30.464
LIAM: Yes, okay.

02:26:30.464 --> 02:26:31.713
MARISHA: I look at--

02:26:31.713 --> 02:26:35.657
LIAM: I go and collect Veth's family.

02:26:36.510 --> 02:26:39.730
LAURA: I finish telling Carlos some bullshit about

02:26:41.130 --> 02:26:44.080
the bathroom decor that I'm wanting,

02:26:44.080 --> 02:26:46.863
and I make my exit as well.

02:26:49.580 --> 02:26:52.873
MATT: "We will do our best to make
these arrangements for you.

02:26:54.754 --> 02:26:56.629
"I mean, we just had it redone.

02:26:59.410 --> 02:27:00.388
"We'll take care of it."

02:27:00.388 --> 02:27:02.115
LAURA: Carlos.
MATT: "Don't worry."

02:27:02.115 --> 02:27:02.948
LAURA: I--

02:27:06.470 --> 02:27:08.413
Maybe we should close up tonight,

02:27:10.030 --> 02:27:13.093
I'm feeling tired,
I don't want to entertain.

02:27:17.740 --> 02:27:18.573
MATT: "As you wish."

02:27:21.520 --> 02:27:23.960
He seems a bit confused by

02:27:23.960 --> 02:27:25.610
a lot of what's happened in here.

02:27:26.502 --> 02:27:28.227
And just kind of--

02:27:29.370 --> 02:27:31.290
He seems unsettled,

02:27:31.290 --> 02:27:33.490
but begins to go through the motions of

02:27:34.830 --> 02:27:35.990
cleaning off spaces and talking

02:27:35.990 --> 02:27:37.170
to some of the patrons at the tables.

02:27:37.170 --> 02:27:39.570
Letting them know that they'll be shuttering up.

02:27:42.630 --> 02:27:44.480
You guys are gathering your things.

02:27:44.480 --> 02:27:47.153
Your mother is still packing in the room.

02:27:49.470 --> 02:27:52.180
They have whatever's on them and they had the market.

02:27:52.180 --> 02:27:53.400
All the rest of their main things

02:27:53.400 --> 02:27:55.650
are still at your house, including the money.

02:27:58.080 --> 02:28:00.773
But you are currently following the two of them.

02:28:02.950 --> 02:28:07.073
As they exit, they make their way through the Opal Archways.

02:28:08.390 --> 02:28:12.340
You can see heading in a northwestern direction

02:28:12.340 --> 02:28:14.813
to a familiar district.

02:28:17.010 --> 02:28:17.843
Actually,

02:28:19.200 --> 02:28:20.850
I don't know if you were present for the event,

02:28:20.850 --> 02:28:22.393
the party that took place.

02:28:23.690 --> 02:28:24.523
SAM: The party?

02:28:24.523 --> 02:28:26.189
MATT: Yeah, were you--
SAM: Yeah, I was there.

02:28:26.189 --> 02:28:27.447
MATT: You were there?
SAM: Yeah.

02:28:27.447 --> 02:28:29.453
MATT: I was trying to remember which--
part of members of the group were dist--

02:28:29.453 --> 02:28:31.100
SAM: I locked somebody on a balcony.

02:28:31.100 --> 02:28:32.003
MATT: Yes, you did.

02:28:33.258 --> 02:28:34.091
TRAVIS: True Sight.

02:28:34.091 --> 02:28:35.835
MATT: Yeah, not that--
MARISHA: Saw magic fish.

02:28:35.835 --> 02:28:36.668
MATT: Yes.
MARISHA: That's right.

02:28:36.668 --> 02:28:39.360
MATT: Not that house, but that same region.

02:28:39.360 --> 02:28:42.810
There is one building that looks somewhat officious,

02:28:42.810 --> 02:28:46.330
but also quite elegant.

02:28:46.330 --> 02:28:48.970
And they both head to that area,

02:28:48.970 --> 02:28:50.520
and as they step through an alley

02:28:50.520 --> 02:28:52.630
you watch as the illusions fade.

02:28:52.630 --> 02:28:55.910
And it's back to Astrid and Eadwulf.

02:28:55.910 --> 02:29:00.740
Though their attire is still a similar presentation

02:29:00.740 --> 02:29:04.440
as to what you saw in the Lavish Chateau.

02:29:04.440 --> 02:29:06.620
As they begin to approach the exterior of this

02:29:06.620 --> 02:29:08.190
you see the door open.

02:29:08.190 --> 02:29:11.170
And another individual,

02:29:11.170 --> 02:29:13.230
though wearing a similar attire,

02:29:13.230 --> 02:29:16.790
but having the same volstrucker tattoos across their arms.

02:29:16.790 --> 02:29:20.633
It looks to be an older woman.

02:29:22.970 --> 02:29:24.150
Looks to be half-elf,

02:29:24.150 --> 02:29:27.393
possibly in her late 40s or so.

02:29:28.440 --> 02:29:30.953
And to the right of her,

02:29:31.930 --> 02:29:35.120
a familiar, red-robed

02:29:36.070 --> 02:29:37.320
Trent Ikithon.

02:29:37.320 --> 02:29:38.638
SAM: Oh shit.
ASHLEY: He's here.

02:29:38.638 --> 02:29:40.360
LIAM: Fuck.

02:29:40.360 --> 02:29:43.205
MARISHA: All of our suspicious,

02:29:43.205 --> 02:29:45.531
neurotic beliefs

02:29:45.531 --> 02:29:46.707
were real.

02:29:46.707 --> 02:29:48.540
SAM: And we're three blocks away.

02:29:48.540 --> 02:29:49.373
MATT: Three blocks away.

02:29:49.373 --> 02:29:51.006
SAM: Oh!
MATT: Or, yeah, about a--

02:29:51.006 --> 02:29:52.440
TALIESIN: It's not paranoid if
they're really looking for us.

02:29:52.440 --> 02:29:53.969
MARISHA: We're not paranoid.

02:29:53.969 --> 02:29:54.802
LAURA: What was it?

02:29:54.802 --> 02:29:56.543
SAM: Trent is three blocks away.
MARISHA: Trent is here!

02:29:56.543 --> 02:29:57.610
LIAM: -- safe house or something

02:29:57.610 --> 02:29:59.650
three blocks from the Chateau.

02:29:59.650 --> 02:30:02.740
MARISHA: Wait, who's the other woman, also an older member?

02:30:02.740 --> 02:30:04.400
MATT: You've never seen this woman.

02:30:04.400 --> 02:30:05.380
MARISHA: Never seen this woman.

02:30:05.380 --> 02:30:08.046
TRAVIS: Another volstrucker, female elf.

02:30:09.912 --> 02:30:13.070
MATT: And you see as they come bolting out of the structure,

02:30:13.070 --> 02:30:15.920
you can see some other members

02:30:15.920 --> 02:30:19.220
of Concordian guard following
behind hurriedly, looking confused.

02:30:20.430 --> 02:30:24.220
As he just rushes by and heads towards the gate,

02:30:24.220 --> 02:30:25.770
raises his hand, the gates open.

02:30:25.770 --> 02:30:28.370
And you see the two of them approach and give a bow,

02:30:28.370 --> 02:30:31.773
and they begin having a conversation rather rapidly.

02:30:31.773 --> 02:30:32.930
SAM: Okay.

02:30:32.930 --> 02:30:33.860
I will--

02:30:35.600 --> 02:30:37.330
MATT: You're still in the alley.

02:30:37.330 --> 02:30:38.530
They just left the alley to head in

02:30:38.530 --> 02:30:40.830
towards the front courtyard,

02:30:40.830 --> 02:30:42.030
fenced-off area at the front

02:30:42.030 --> 02:30:43.820
of this larger, officious structure.

02:30:43.820 --> 02:30:44.950
SAM: Okay.

02:30:44.950 --> 02:30:46.820
I'll go back a block,

02:30:46.820 --> 02:30:48.370
getting away from them.

02:30:48.370 --> 02:30:49.203
MATT: Okay.

02:30:53.010 --> 02:30:56.310
SAM: I'll just run back as fast as I can.

02:30:56.310 --> 02:30:57.143
MATT: Okay.

02:30:58.190 --> 02:31:01.660
TALIESIN: I assume we're already
halfway out the door at this point.

02:31:01.660 --> 02:31:02.988
TRAVIS: With who?

02:31:02.988 --> 02:31:05.170
TALIESIN: Everybody.
TRAVIS: Everybody.

02:31:05.170 --> 02:31:07.130
MARISHA: We've got a split up.

02:31:07.130 --> 02:31:09.130
TALIESIN: What if we meet at the tower? Meet at the tower.

02:31:09.130 --> 02:31:11.596
TRAVIS: Anyone in that building in five minutes

02:31:11.596 --> 02:31:14.963
is dead or tortured. Everybody has to come.

02:31:16.180 --> 02:31:18.360
Okay, so we're heading to Yussa's,

02:31:18.360 --> 02:31:20.820
taking different ways to get there.

02:31:20.820 --> 02:31:22.874
As soon as I get back:

02:31:22.874 --> 02:31:25.840
Trent's here, he's going to be here in three minutes.

02:31:25.840 --> 02:31:27.060
We have to go now.

02:31:27.060 --> 02:31:28.580
Everybody out.

02:31:28.580 --> 02:31:30.010
TALIESIN: Can you message?

02:31:30.010 --> 02:31:30.843
LAURA: To who?

02:31:30.843 --> 02:31:31.950
TALIESIN: People.

02:31:31.950 --> 02:31:33.538
LIAM: Sending, Message, Message.

02:31:33.538 --> 02:31:35.699
LAURA: I have one Sending left.

02:31:35.699 --> 02:31:36.630
Who am I sending a message to?

02:31:36.630 --> 02:31:39.423
TALIESIN: Just so we have one with both groups.

02:31:40.810 --> 02:31:42.802
MARISHA: Splitting up the people who can message each other.

02:31:42.802 --> 02:31:44.735
LAURA: I'm just grabbing mom's stuff,

02:31:44.735 --> 02:31:45.987
and grabbing her bags.

02:31:45.987 --> 02:31:48.467
And we have to go, we have to go <i>now.</i>

02:31:49.340 --> 02:31:50.173
MATT: "All right."

02:31:51.439 --> 02:31:53.631
Are you guys exiting through the front?

02:31:54.570 --> 02:31:55.887
TALIESIN: If there's a back, let's take it.

02:31:55.887 --> 02:31:56.970
MATT: There is a back.

02:31:56.970 --> 02:32:00.210
LAURA: Yeah, let's go down back.

02:32:00.210 --> 02:32:02.400
MATT: Scooting by, rushing past, Carlos is like--

02:32:02.400 --> 02:32:04.280
you can see now most patrons are in the process

02:32:04.280 --> 02:32:05.280
of leaving at this point.

02:32:05.280 --> 02:32:07.880
And Carlos and Bluud are both closing the doors,

02:32:07.880 --> 02:32:11.065
and it looks like--
LAURA: Leave now, run, go.

02:32:11.065 --> 02:32:11.939
MATT: (as Carlos) What?

02:32:11.939 --> 02:32:13.460
LAURA: <i>Go</i>.

02:32:13.460 --> 02:32:14.730
MATT: (as Carlos) "What is going on?"

02:32:14.730 --> 02:32:17.540
MARISHA: Just to listen to her and go, please.

02:32:17.540 --> 02:32:18.620
We don't have time to explain;

02:32:18.620 --> 02:32:20.110
you'll be dead before we do.

02:32:20.110 --> 02:32:20.950
MATT: "Fine."

02:32:20.950 --> 02:32:21.900
LIAM: The building is compromised,

02:32:21.900 --> 02:32:23.200
you will hear from us in the coming days.

02:32:23.200 --> 02:32:24.310
Go, please.

02:32:24.310 --> 02:32:26.060
MATT: (as Carlos) "All right, let me finish closing."

02:32:27.220 --> 02:32:30.510
All right, you guys head out through the back door,

02:32:30.510 --> 02:32:31.593
out into the street.

02:32:33.140 --> 02:32:35.998
I would like you all to make a stealth check, please.

02:32:37.013 --> 02:32:37.963
TALIESIN: Not my best.

02:32:39.030 --> 02:32:39.863
MATT: With?

02:32:41.390 --> 02:32:43.733
A mother, a father, and a child.

02:32:44.590 --> 02:32:45.753
MARISHA: We got to split up.

02:32:47.010 --> 02:32:48.383
MATT: All right, so we have?

02:32:50.653 --> 02:32:51.486
TRAVIS: Two.

02:32:52.602 --> 02:32:53.933
LAURA: 16.

02:32:53.933 --> 02:32:54.939
LIAM: 17.

02:32:54.939 --> 02:32:56.151
SAM: 34-- 33.

02:32:56.151 --> 02:32:58.317
LAURA: I'm going to give the Blessing Of The Trickster

02:32:58.317 --> 02:33:00.570
to my mother, to try to help her stealth.

02:33:00.570 --> 02:33:01.890
MATT: Okay.

02:33:01.890 --> 02:33:05.540
MARISHA: This is where our luck fails us.

02:33:05.540 --> 02:33:07.180
ASHLEY: Seven.

02:33:07.180 --> 02:33:08.830
TALIESIN: 20.

02:33:08.830 --> 02:33:10.496
MARISHA: 26.
SAM: Shut up, Marisha.

02:33:11.333 --> 02:33:12.458
ASHLEY: Okay, two of us rolled low.

02:33:12.458 --> 02:33:13.740
LIAM: Damn it, Ray.

02:33:13.740 --> 02:33:18.610
MATT: All right, you are now darting through the streets,

02:33:18.610 --> 02:33:21.360
holding onto the hands of the stragglers,

02:33:21.360 --> 02:33:22.670
pushing through alleyways.

02:33:22.670 --> 02:33:24.470
And darting through individuals that

02:33:25.340 --> 02:33:27.980
seem to just watch you as you brush past their shoulders,

02:33:27.980 --> 02:33:29.703
abruptly confused.

02:33:30.679 --> 02:33:33.383
SAM: I just whisper to Luc: Remember what we practiced?

02:33:33.383 --> 02:33:34.632
MATT: "Yeah, yeah."
SAM: Do that.

02:33:34.632 --> 02:33:35.465
MATT: "Okay."

02:33:36.820 --> 02:33:39.580
Until eventually you work your way towards Tidepeak Tower.

02:33:39.580 --> 02:33:41.870
You can see the peak of it coming closer

02:33:41.870 --> 02:33:43.133
and closer into view.

02:33:43.970 --> 02:33:47.628
The sounds of the streets of Nicodranas begin to fade,

02:33:47.628 --> 02:33:49.790
until once again the sound of your heartbeat,

02:33:49.790 --> 02:33:51.980
in your throat, and in your ears.

02:33:51.980 --> 02:33:55.093
Your eyes crisp, looking around constantly paranoid

02:33:55.093 --> 02:33:58.310
just seeing any sort of familiar sight of the volstrucker

02:33:58.310 --> 02:34:01.910
and/or Master Ikithon himself.

02:34:01.910 --> 02:34:04.510
As you make your way closer and closer to the tower.

02:34:05.440 --> 02:34:06.434
That's where we're going to take a break.

02:34:06.434 --> 02:34:07.313
(groaning)

02:34:07.313 --> 02:34:09.653
LIAM: Oh my god.
SAM: Oh, you bastard.

02:34:09.653 --> 02:34:10.853
TALIESIN: (groans)

02:34:10.853 --> 02:34:12.177
SAM: It just won't stop.

02:34:12.177 --> 02:34:14.710
MARISHA: It just won't stop!
LIAM: We've been playing this for years,

02:34:14.710 --> 02:34:16.203
it's make-believe.

02:34:17.080 --> 02:34:19.380
I am so scared!

02:34:19.380 --> 02:34:22.440
TALIESIN: My cardiovascular disagrees.

02:34:22.440 --> 02:34:23.273
ASHLEY: Me, too.

02:34:23.273 --> 02:34:24.680
LIAM: This is what I've worried about

02:34:24.680 --> 02:34:27.190
since the first day we set foot in Nicodranas,

02:34:27.190 --> 02:34:28.329
and it is happening.

02:34:28.329 --> 02:34:31.600
MARISHA: Yeah. Yeah.

02:34:31.600 --> 02:34:33.822
TALIESIN: At least they can't magically track us.

02:34:33.822 --> 02:34:34.770
LIAM: (scared noise)

02:34:34.770 --> 02:34:38.070
LAURA: Yeah. Yeah. We have, well--

02:34:38.070 --> 02:34:40.730
Was it long enough? Was it an hour?

02:34:40.730 --> 02:34:43.730
Did they have long enough the the necklaces that they--

02:34:43.730 --> 02:34:45.466
SAM: Well, they don't know who they are.

02:34:45.466 --> 02:34:46.650
MATT: For who? As far as?

02:34:46.650 --> 02:34:48.250
SAM: Family members.

02:34:48.250 --> 02:34:49.195
MATT: Your family members, no.

02:34:49.195 --> 02:34:50.028
LIAM: The Brenattos.
LAURA: Okay.

02:34:50.028 --> 02:34:51.608
Cool, cool, cool.

02:34:51.608 --> 02:34:53.028
SAM: I don't know if they know who they are.

02:34:53.028 --> 02:34:54.055
They might not know who they are.

02:34:54.055 --> 02:34:55.446
TALIESIN: Well, we'll see.
MARISHA: They know who they are.

02:34:55.446 --> 02:34:58.548
LIAM: They know, because Astrid and Eadwulf

02:34:58.548 --> 02:35:02.170
said that they talked to the guard left behind in Vergesson

02:35:02.170 --> 02:35:05.013
who linked us to here.

02:35:05.990 --> 02:35:07.362
TRAVIS: Oh my gosh, let's go to a break;
I got to pee so bad.

02:35:07.362 --> 02:35:08.670
TALIESIN: Break!
MATT: Yes.

02:35:08.670 --> 02:35:09.969
We'll go to a break; we'll be back in a few minutes.

02:35:09.969 --> 02:35:11.398
We'll see you guys shortly.
LIAM: Oh.

02:35:11.398 --> 02:35:12.231
Shit.

02:35:12.954 --> 02:35:14.834
Hello, everyone, I'm Todd Kenreck,

02:35:14.834 --> 02:35:17.884
and I'm very excited for a new live play show

02:35:17.884 --> 02:35:20.954
that my friend B. Dave Walters is dungeon mastering.

02:35:20.954 --> 02:35:24.174
I spoke to him about how this is kind of unique.

02:35:24.174 --> 02:35:27.184
It is going to be a trans-media series

02:35:27.184 --> 02:35:29.314
in the sense that the events of the show are going

02:35:29.314 --> 02:35:31.984
to directly affect the video game "Idol Champions,"

02:35:31.984 --> 02:35:36.334
and vice versa, not just a voting component,

02:35:36.334 --> 02:35:38.544
but literally the actions the players take

02:35:38.544 --> 02:35:40.134
on both sides of the screen

02:35:40.134 --> 02:35:41.734
are going to connect

02:35:41.734 --> 02:35:43.134
and affect how it all plays out.

02:35:43.134 --> 02:35:44.754
Should be pretty interesting.

02:35:44.754 --> 02:35:46.054
We've been working hard on it.

02:35:46.054 --> 02:35:49.014
Every week, we're going to have an opportunity

02:35:49.014 --> 02:35:50.754
to vote on some things,

02:35:50.754 --> 02:35:54.524
and pending how some other in-game events shake out

02:35:54.524 --> 02:35:55.964
will affect the stream itself.

02:35:55.964 --> 02:35:59.684
Things from, literally, certain items

02:35:59.684 --> 02:36:01.774
some of the cast will get to possess,

02:36:01.774 --> 02:36:03.914
certain characters that may or may not show up,

02:36:03.914 --> 02:36:05.404
the names of certain characters

02:36:05.404 --> 02:36:07.474
that may or may not show up,

02:36:07.474 --> 02:36:10.394
the intensity of some of the enemies that we will fight

02:36:10.394 --> 02:36:12.784
on the stream, or they will fight on the stream,

02:36:12.784 --> 02:36:14.454
all are gonna be dictated by the audience.

02:36:14.454 --> 02:36:17.074
I think they know I'm specially qualified for this,

02:36:17.074 --> 02:36:19.414
because, if the audience votes, like,

02:36:19.414 --> 02:36:21.244
rocks fall and everybody dies,

02:36:21.244 --> 02:36:23.104
everyone knows I will do it.

02:36:23.104 --> 02:36:26.844
Yeah, it should be a great thing, hopefully.

02:36:26.844 --> 02:36:28.724
You can catch this brand new show

02:36:28.724 --> 02:36:30.394
from 4:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.

02:36:30.394 --> 02:36:33.374
on Codename Entertainment's very own Twitch channel

02:36:33.374 --> 02:36:34.634
every Monday.

02:36:34.634 --> 02:36:36.542
Thank you so much for watching.

02:36:36.542 --> 02:36:37.375
(eerie music)

02:36:37.375 --> 02:36:39.792
(logo bangs)

02:36:42.154 --> 02:36:44.774
Marisha, tell us about your thought process

02:36:44.774 --> 02:36:47.424
behind planning this date,

02:36:47.424 --> 02:36:50.744
and what it was like receiving Caleb's help

02:36:50.744 --> 02:36:51.937
in executing it.

02:36:52.784 --> 02:36:55.904
You know, much like many of Ashley and I's first dates,

02:36:55.904 --> 02:36:57.144
they were narrated by Liam.

02:36:57.144 --> 02:36:59.644
(woman laugh)

02:37:00.833 --> 02:37:02.944
Did he narrate your proposal too?

02:37:02.944 --> 02:37:05.448
Yes, he was there in the booth next to us

02:37:05.448 --> 02:37:07.598
at the Mexican restaurant we like to go to.

02:37:09.684 --> 02:37:11.814
At this point, he will attempt to hold hands with her,

02:37:11.814 --> 02:37:13.754
and she will say, mm-mm, too early.

02:37:13.754 --> 02:37:16.904
(women laugh)

02:37:16.904 --> 02:37:17.911
Too soon.

02:37:17.911 --> 02:37:19.254
Too soon.

02:37:19.254 --> 02:37:21.744
He will then cower away into the bathroom for 25 minutes,

02:37:21.744 --> 02:37:23.257
and slap himself.

02:37:24.814 --> 02:37:26.064
Slap himself?

02:37:31.361 --> 02:37:35.111
(whimsical orchestral music)

02:37:35.971 --> 02:37:38.971
(typewriter clicks)

02:37:41.431 --> 02:37:43.848
(bell dings)

02:38:01.211 --> 02:38:03.254
Hey, critters, Laura Bailey here.

02:38:03.254 --> 02:38:06.192
Let's see what's up in the Critical Role shop.

02:38:06.192 --> 02:38:08.524
(bees buzz)

02:38:08.524 --> 02:38:10.654
Oh my gosh, it's so amazing.

02:38:13.427 --> 02:38:15.094
I mean, the traveler always says

02:38:15.094 --> 02:38:17.427
impulse purchases are a good decision.

02:38:19.964 --> 02:38:22.317
Go ahead, darling, treat yourself.

02:38:25.954 --> 02:38:28.307
The cuteness, it's overpowering.

02:38:32.064 --> 02:38:34.127
It's so cute, I can't handle it.

02:38:35.560 --> 02:38:36.393
(mouse clicks)

02:38:36.393 --> 02:38:38.397
So click on over to the Critical Role shop.

02:38:39.364 --> 02:38:41.274
Don't worry, there's a few more minutes in the break.

02:38:41.274 --> 02:38:42.327
You still got time.

02:38:45.494 --> 02:38:50.117
Subscribe, or don't subscribe.

02:38:51.964 --> 02:38:54.067
Oh, that's not a question.

02:38:56.384 --> 02:38:58.284
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind

02:38:58.284 --> 02:39:02.957
to ponder the pros and more pros of Twitch or Twitch Prime,

02:39:04.334 --> 02:39:06.974
or to take hands and gift new subs

02:39:06.974 --> 02:39:09.407
to critters who find they can't afford them.

02:39:11.334 --> 02:39:16.334
To play, to sleep, no more.

02:39:20.524 --> 02:39:23.284
And by asleep, to say the cast and crew

02:39:23.284 --> 02:39:25.284
of Critical Role might find their naps

02:39:25.284 --> 02:39:28.584
around the hectic schedule of a live broadcast

02:39:28.584 --> 02:39:31.044
that we have brought for your consumption,

02:39:31.044 --> 02:39:33.687
both critter and fan alike.

02:39:36.334 --> 02:39:39.447
To play or sleep.

02:39:41.056 --> 02:39:42.764
(Liam huffs)

02:39:42.764 --> 02:39:46.657
No sleep, but just to stream.

02:39:48.354 --> 02:39:49.997
Ay, there's the rub,

02:39:51.134 --> 02:39:53.454
for with your subscription,

02:39:53.454 --> 02:39:55.597
what streams may come.

02:39:59.784 --> 02:40:00.914
Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man,

02:40:00.914 --> 02:40:02.524
that is a fucking tagline.

02:40:02.524 --> 02:40:04.119
Do we got that?

02:40:04.119 --> 02:40:06.577
Oh, that is Twitch poetry.

02:40:07.971 --> 02:40:09.344
(Liam grunts)

02:40:09.344 --> 02:40:13.344
Oh, anyway, subscribe to Critical Role.

02:40:13.344 --> 02:40:15.444
Use Twitch Prime to subscribe.

02:40:15.444 --> 02:40:17.097
Gift some subscriptions.

02:40:18.083 --> 02:40:19.000
You got it.

02:40:21.483 --> 02:40:22.884
Hm.

02:40:22.884 --> 02:40:24.244
Wrong soliloquy for the skull,

02:40:24.244 --> 02:40:27.585
but that's fucking good.

02:40:27.585 --> 02:40:31.002
(lively classical music)

02:51:59.274 --> 02:52:00.894
MATT: And welcome back.

02:52:00.894 --> 02:52:04.794
So as you all are rushing through the streets,

02:52:04.794 --> 02:52:08.097
worried of being in pursuit of Master Trent Ikithon

02:52:08.097 --> 02:52:09.704
of the Cerberus Assembly,

02:52:09.704 --> 02:52:14.664
your semi-inconspicuous crew is pushing past street

02:52:14.664 --> 02:52:19.184
after cobblestone street, pushing into the Open Quay,

02:52:19.184 --> 02:52:21.843
or "key," or however else you want to pronounce it.

02:52:21.843 --> 02:52:23.017
SAM and MARISHA: The k-huay.
MATT: Remember that again?

02:52:23.017 --> 02:52:25.931
SAM: The quay.

02:52:25.931 --> 02:52:27.524
ASHLEY: The out-squirts of the--

02:52:27.524 --> 02:52:28.552
MATT: Exactly.
MARISHA: The out-squirts?

02:52:28.552 --> 02:52:31.784
MATT: You begin to approach Tidepeak Tower now,

02:52:31.784 --> 02:52:33.824
still standing high above.

02:52:33.824 --> 02:52:35.924
You watch, as you get closer and closer,

02:52:35.924 --> 02:52:38.274
the shape itself seems to adjust with your proximity,

02:52:38.274 --> 02:52:41.601
and as you get closer, it is impossibly tall.

02:52:41.601 --> 02:52:42.574
LAURA: Are we all still together?

02:52:42.574 --> 02:52:43.734
We didn't split up, right?

02:52:43.734 --> 02:52:44.754
LIAM: We didn't work it out.
MATT: You didn't.

02:52:44.754 --> 02:52:48.004
LAURA: Okay, then I am going to send my last message

02:52:48.004 --> 02:52:51.117
of the day to Wensforth.

02:52:51.117 --> 02:52:51.950
MATT: Wensforth, okay.

02:52:51.950 --> 02:52:55.514
LAURA: And say: Hey, it's us.

02:52:55.514 --> 02:52:57.194
Open the door, we're coming to the tower.

02:52:57.194 --> 02:52:58.027
We're at the bottom.

02:52:58.027 --> 02:52:59.925
Come and open the door, please, really fast.

02:52:59.925 --> 02:53:01.570
We're here. Thank you!

02:53:03.974 --> 02:53:05.374
MATT: "Oh, okay.

02:53:05.374 --> 02:53:06.949
"Give me just a moment."

02:53:06.949 --> 02:53:08.994
LAURA: (nervous vocalizing)

02:53:08.994 --> 02:53:10.004
I'm saying that as we're running up,

02:53:10.004 --> 02:53:11.204
so hopefully, as we approach,

02:53:11.204 --> 02:53:12.147
the door will be--

02:53:12.147 --> 02:53:12.980
MATT: Right.
TALIESIN: Pass Without a Trace,

02:53:12.980 --> 02:53:13.991
Pass Without a Trace?

02:53:13.991 --> 02:53:16.154
LAURA: ♪ I don't have any more Pass Without a Trace. ♪

02:53:16.154 --> 02:53:16.987
TALIESIN: That's fair.

02:53:18.074 --> 02:53:19.614
MATT: As you all approach

02:53:19.614 --> 02:53:21.294
and get to the base of the tower.

02:53:21.294 --> 02:53:22.684
You impatiently look around,

02:53:22.684 --> 02:53:25.094
and there are some vendors that are

02:53:25.094 --> 02:53:28.664
watching this group rush into the middle

02:53:28.664 --> 02:53:30.514
of this open space around the tower.

02:53:30.514 --> 02:53:33.655
Anybody approaching Tidepeak Tower,

02:53:33.655 --> 02:53:35.637
it's a rare enough circumstance

02:53:35.637 --> 02:53:37.364
where people tend to be a little nosy,

02:53:37.364 --> 02:53:39.187
so some people are just looking over,

02:53:40.177 --> 02:53:41.304
and as you notice them,

02:53:41.304 --> 02:53:43.534
and glance about to where they are,

02:53:43.534 --> 02:53:44.784
you look back to the tower,

02:53:44.784 --> 02:53:48.171
and the door is there where it was not previously.

02:53:48.171 --> 02:53:49.004
SAM: Oh, yes.

02:53:50.176 --> 02:53:51.842
MATT: At which point, the door

02:53:51.842 --> 02:53:54.214
opens up, and you can see the goblin face

02:53:54.214 --> 02:53:55.914
of Wensforth poking through.

02:53:56.904 --> 02:53:58.281
"Come on in, come on in."

02:53:58.281 --> 02:54:00.052
SAM: Out of the way.
LAURA: Run, run, run, run.

02:54:00.052 --> 02:54:01.319
LIAM: Yes, and also, please

02:54:01.319 --> 02:54:02.954
remove the door as soon as we're in.

02:54:02.954 --> 02:54:05.054
MATT: "Oh, course, course."

02:54:05.054 --> 02:54:06.831
As you all step inside, he's kind of,

02:54:06.831 --> 02:54:11.831
"Oh, oh. Oh! Milady." Gives a bow to Marion.

02:54:11.913 --> 02:54:13.134
He's just looking in.

02:54:13.134 --> 02:54:15.604
Because you are carrying the Ruby of the Sea

02:54:15.604 --> 02:54:16.437
through the streets with you,

02:54:16.437 --> 02:54:17.334
which, in its own right--
LAURA: Yeah, it's probably noticeable.

02:54:17.334 --> 02:54:19.024
MATT: A lot of people are,

02:54:19.024 --> 02:54:20.357
"Whoa, is that--?"

02:54:21.224 --> 02:54:22.724
LIAM: That's quite a thing for Marion.

02:54:22.724 --> 02:54:24.364
MATT: Which, at this point, you do notice,

02:54:24.364 --> 02:54:26.963
as she comes in, she is shaking.

02:54:26.963 --> 02:54:28.406
MARISHA: Aww, sweetie.

02:54:28.406 --> 02:54:31.242
MATT: There is sweat pouring down her face,

02:54:31.242 --> 02:54:34.027
and her complexion is much paler.

02:54:34.027 --> 02:54:35.043
LAURA: Just look at me, Mama.

02:54:35.043 --> 02:54:36.704
Just look at me, okay?
MATT: (panicked breathing)

02:54:36.704 --> 02:54:38.054
TALIESIN: Would you like some help?

02:54:39.384 --> 02:54:40.414
Magical help?

02:54:40.414 --> 02:54:41.444
MATT: "Certainly."

02:54:41.444 --> 02:54:43.464
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Calm Emotions.

02:54:43.464 --> 02:54:44.630
Should help.

02:54:45.560 --> 02:54:48.655
MATT: (sighs, exhales)

02:54:48.655 --> 02:54:51.247
And it does. It actually does have
a very positive effect on her,

02:54:51.247 --> 02:54:53.034
and she immediately slumps

02:54:53.034 --> 02:54:56.974
into one of the nearby sofa-like arrangements

02:54:56.974 --> 02:54:58.994
in this bottom floor of Tidepeak Tower,

02:54:58.994 --> 02:55:03.514
and looks like she'd been through a marathon,

02:55:03.514 --> 02:55:04.864
is just exhausted.

02:55:04.864 --> 02:55:08.324
She's still clutching your hand tightly,

02:55:08.324 --> 02:55:09.912
and then, eventually, looks up at you

02:55:09.912 --> 02:55:11.354
with a soft smile, and goes,

02:55:14.451 --> 02:55:15.842
"I did it."

02:55:15.842 --> 02:55:16.964
LAURA: You did it.

02:55:16.964 --> 02:55:18.345
MATT: "Where are we?"

02:55:18.345 --> 02:55:21.519
LAURA: We're in a tower!

02:55:21.519 --> 02:55:23.011
A magical tower.

02:55:24.242 --> 02:55:25.075
Yussa!

02:55:26.164 --> 02:55:29.535
MATT: At which point, Wensforth,

02:55:29.535 --> 02:55:30.493
let me see here.

02:55:32.804 --> 02:55:37.420
Says, "So can I ask you

02:55:37.420 --> 02:55:39.674
"what your business is here with the master?"

02:55:39.674 --> 02:55:42.024
LAURA: We would desperately like

02:55:42.024 --> 02:55:46.457
for Yussa to help us transport somewhere.

02:55:48.414 --> 02:55:49.264
MATT: "Okay."

02:55:49.264 --> 02:55:51.799
LIAM: It is actually quite tense, so,

02:55:51.799 --> 02:55:54.982
if he's doing something, it is really worth interrupting.

02:55:55.877 --> 02:55:57.052
MATT: "I understand that.

02:55:59.894 --> 02:56:02.341
"He's not reachable at the moment."

02:56:03.224 --> 02:56:04.057
LAURA: Is he in the ball?

02:56:04.057 --> 02:56:05.061
MARISHA: He didn't go back in the ball, did he?

02:56:05.061 --> 02:56:06.681
MATT: "No, no, no.

02:56:09.834 --> 02:56:11.794
"After your previous conversation,

02:56:11.794 --> 02:56:15.994
"he was going to go on sort of a,

02:56:15.994 --> 02:56:20.674
"as he put it, an information-gathering excursion

02:56:20.674 --> 02:56:23.304
"into the astral plane."

02:56:23.304 --> 02:56:24.174
SAM: Oh, wow.

02:56:24.174 --> 02:56:25.584
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

02:56:25.584 --> 02:56:27.392
MATT: "So..." And you see him going up the stairs,

02:56:27.392 --> 02:56:30.214
and giving a "follow me" motion.

02:56:30.214 --> 02:56:33.454
SAM: Does he have a teleportation circle we can use?

02:56:33.454 --> 02:56:35.079
MARISHA: But Caleb, do you still have

02:56:35.079 --> 02:56:36.403
enough energy?
LIAM: No.

02:56:37.569 --> 02:56:38.504
MARISHA: That's the problem.

02:56:38.504 --> 02:56:40.026
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

02:56:40.026 --> 02:56:42.974
SAM: Wensforth, we don't want to endanger you,

02:56:42.974 --> 02:56:47.545
but is this place safe, magically speaking?

02:56:49.388 --> 02:56:50.471
MATT: "I think so."

02:56:51.494 --> 02:56:54.914
TALIESIN: We have somebody who's-- I mean,

02:56:54.914 --> 02:56:58.754
we need to tell him what we're running from.

02:56:58.754 --> 02:57:00.914
LIAM: Is there any chance you have the ability

02:57:00.914 --> 02:57:03.274
to work the circle at the top of the tower?

02:57:03.274 --> 02:57:06.424
MATT: "Oh, (chuckles) any sort of magic I know

02:57:06.424 --> 02:57:09.714
"is extremely rudimentary, sorry."

02:57:09.714 --> 02:57:12.754
LAURA: What about the amplification circle?

02:57:12.754 --> 02:57:13.787
Do you have that?

02:57:15.051 --> 02:57:16.767
MATT: "I could probably access that.

02:57:17.874 --> 02:57:19.824
"Let me see if I can wake up the master."

02:57:20.841 --> 02:57:24.674
And he goes and starts heading up the stairs, arcing up.

02:57:26.844 --> 02:57:27.677
Do you follow?

02:57:27.677 --> 02:57:28.534
LIAM: Yes.
TALIESIN: Yes.

02:57:28.534 --> 02:57:30.164
MATT: Okay, heading up to the secondary floor,

02:57:30.164 --> 02:57:33.119
you come to his first base laboratory,

02:57:33.119 --> 02:57:35.444
where you had previously spent some time with him,

02:57:35.444 --> 02:57:37.124
and where the ball of Halas,

02:57:37.124 --> 02:57:39.504
the Folding Halls sphere, the Happy Fun Ball,

02:57:39.504 --> 02:57:41.347
is up on the counter right there.

02:57:42.654 --> 02:57:43.624
Curtains are closed,

02:57:43.624 --> 02:57:46.404
and you can see there's some general incense

02:57:46.404 --> 02:57:48.588
that has burned off.

02:57:48.588 --> 02:57:53.034
The vaporous scent of it is fading over time,

02:57:53.034 --> 02:57:54.214
but in the middle of this chamber,

02:57:54.214 --> 02:57:56.545
you can see a lot of the tables

02:57:56.545 --> 02:57:58.674
and shelving elements have been pushed to the sides.

02:57:58.674 --> 02:58:03.674
In the middle, there is a comfortable, reclined chair,

02:58:03.754 --> 02:58:05.534
and there, laying in it,

02:58:05.534 --> 02:58:07.994
hands folded in the front, lying back,

02:58:07.994 --> 02:58:10.957
eyes closed, is Yussa.

02:58:12.044 --> 02:58:15.894
And Wensforth goes up to him,

02:58:15.894 --> 02:58:17.837
grabs the arm, shakes.

02:58:18.984 --> 02:58:19.817
"Master.

02:58:21.845 --> 02:58:25.495
"Master, we've got company.

02:58:28.184 --> 02:58:29.017
"Master?"

02:58:30.111 --> 02:58:31.236
MARISHA: (like Wensforth) Master.

02:58:33.869 --> 02:58:35.264
MATT: "I don't know how to wake him up.

02:58:35.264 --> 02:58:36.884
"I'm sorry.

02:58:36.884 --> 02:58:40.614
"He's been here for about a day on his journey."

02:58:40.614 --> 02:58:43.144
TALIESIN: Can we get ahold of anybody else from here?

02:58:43.144 --> 02:58:48.144
Can we contact, I don't know, Allura?

02:58:48.351 --> 02:58:51.927
LAURA: I have no spells to contact anyone, okay?

02:58:51.927 --> 02:58:52.827
I'm out, I'm out.

02:58:52.827 --> 02:58:54.207
TALIESIN: Or even, is there an object?

02:58:54.207 --> 02:58:56.474
We were talking with a mirror, if I recall.

02:58:56.474 --> 02:58:57.784
LAURA: That was Allura's mirror.

02:58:57.784 --> 02:58:58.902
TALIESIN: She took it back?

02:58:58.902 --> 02:59:00.723
LAURA: Do you have any magic left, Fjord?

02:59:00.723 --> 02:59:01.957
TRAVIS: I have all my magic.

02:59:03.034 --> 02:59:04.257
SAM: He can hit things.

02:59:05.372 --> 02:59:06.948
TRAVIS: I can look like a busboy.

02:59:06.948 --> 02:59:11.124
(laughter)

02:59:11.124 --> 02:59:12.464
SAM: We can just stay here

02:59:12.464 --> 02:59:14.464
and hope that we're...

02:59:15.747 --> 02:59:16.747
safe?

02:59:18.004 --> 02:59:21.117
LAURA: I'm going to cast Command on Yussa.

02:59:22.086 --> 02:59:22.919
SAM: Oh.
MATT: Okay.

02:59:22.919 --> 02:59:24.585
LAURA: I'm going to touch him and I'm going to cast Command,

02:59:24.585 --> 02:59:27.502
and I'm just going to say: Wake up!

02:59:30.744 --> 02:59:32.294
MATT: No effect.

02:59:32.294 --> 02:59:34.364
MARISHA: (sighs)

02:59:34.364 --> 02:59:37.444
MATT: Whatever influence he seems to be under,

02:59:37.444 --> 02:59:38.994
it is extremely powerful,

02:59:38.994 --> 02:59:41.849
and the will of his mind seems

02:59:41.849 --> 02:59:44.244
to be beyond the contact

02:59:44.244 --> 02:59:46.642
of such a rudimentary spell.

02:59:46.642 --> 02:59:48.494
SAM: Should I electrocute him?

02:59:48.494 --> 02:59:53.494
TALIESIN: I think that may be a dangerous path to walk up.

02:59:54.354 --> 02:59:55.644
TRAVIS: Well, unless anyone has any idea

02:59:55.644 --> 02:59:57.689
of how to contact someone outside of here,

02:59:57.689 --> 02:59:58.864
or to get us out,

02:59:58.864 --> 03:00:01.114
we should probably try to fortify this place.

03:00:02.494 --> 03:00:06.114
Yes? Or move.
SAM: No door, so.

03:00:06.114 --> 03:00:07.704
TRAVIS: With a bunch of wizards coming, though.

03:00:07.704 --> 03:00:09.744
I bet they could make one.

03:00:09.744 --> 03:00:10.584
MATT: "Who's coming?"

03:00:10.584 --> 03:00:11.844
LIAM: Wensforth.

03:00:11.844 --> 03:00:12.944
MATT: "Yeah?"

03:00:12.944 --> 03:00:13.934
LIAM: Some of the worst people

03:00:13.934 --> 03:00:17.784
from the Dwendalian Empire are on our tail,

03:00:17.784 --> 03:00:19.440
and they may come here.

03:00:20.667 --> 03:00:22.094
MATT: "Yussa doesn't like that.

03:00:22.094 --> 03:00:23.944
"He hates when politics gets involved."

03:00:24.924 --> 03:00:26.984
LIAM: I beg your forgiveness.

03:00:26.984 --> 03:00:28.484
Is there anything in this tower

03:00:28.484 --> 03:00:30.097
that can help us defend it?

03:00:34.404 --> 03:00:37.162
MATT: "I mean, most of its defenses are tied to

03:00:37.162 --> 03:00:38.974
"the master here."

03:00:38.974 --> 03:00:40.924
LIAM: Is there any room that is off-limits?

03:00:42.164 --> 03:00:45.774
MATT: "Oh, there are a couple that are off-limits,

03:00:45.774 --> 03:00:48.717
"but to everyone but the master."

03:00:50.404 --> 03:00:51.604
MARISHA: Maybe we should leave.

03:00:52.564 --> 03:00:54.664
SAM: Wait, we've been in some of these rooms.

03:00:54.664 --> 03:00:56.454
We've seen magical items

03:00:56.454 --> 03:00:59.054
and artifacts in his study, right?

03:00:59.054 --> 03:01:00.577
Should we at least peruse?

03:01:02.834 --> 03:01:04.074
See if there's something there?

03:01:04.074 --> 03:01:06.532
TALIESIN: Just see if there's
something to get us out of here.

03:01:07.374 --> 03:01:09.054
SAM: Are we in his study now?

03:01:09.054 --> 03:01:09.887
MATT: You're in the study, yeah.

03:01:09.887 --> 03:01:11.624
He's still lying in the middle of the chamber.

03:01:11.624 --> 03:01:13.834
SAM: Let's just do a quick look-see.

03:01:13.834 --> 03:01:15.484
LIAM: We'll scan the room for anything

03:01:15.484 --> 03:01:16.558
that looks--
SAM: As will I.

03:01:16.558 --> 03:01:18.544
LIAM: -- like it could remotely get us out of here.

03:01:18.544 --> 03:01:19.524
SAM: Or help defend.

03:01:19.524 --> 03:01:20.537
TALIESIN: I'm going to give you a

03:01:20.537 --> 03:01:22.434
d4 on that, too.
LIAM: Looking at artifacts, objects.

03:01:22.434 --> 03:01:23.267
MATT: Okay,

03:01:23.267 --> 03:01:28.004
so this is perception or investigation?

03:01:28.004 --> 03:01:28.837
LIAM: Investigation.

03:01:28.837 --> 03:01:29.670
MATT: All right.

03:01:31.384 --> 03:01:32.264
LIAM: You're giving me what, Caduceus?

03:01:32.264 --> 03:01:34.774
TALIESIN: I'm giving you a d4.
LIAM: d4.

03:01:34.774 --> 03:01:35.607
Good.

03:01:37.624 --> 03:01:39.777
Investigation, eight--

03:01:42.154 --> 03:01:42.987
32.

03:01:42.987 --> 03:01:44.867
SAM: Ooh, oh, whoa.

03:01:45.874 --> 03:01:47.974
MATT: All right, and you're helping, you said?

03:01:49.104 --> 03:01:50.774
SAM: If he gives me a task to look for,

03:01:50.774 --> 03:01:51.764
I can look for something,

03:01:51.764 --> 03:01:52.664
but I don't know--

03:01:52.664 --> 03:01:54.704
MATT: I'll say, for the purposes of that roll,

03:01:54.704 --> 03:01:55.694
you wouldn't be the only one

03:01:55.694 --> 03:01:57.424
searching throughout the chambers,

03:01:57.424 --> 03:01:58.802
but all of you begin

03:01:58.802 --> 03:02:01.464
to go through, and Wensforth begins

03:02:01.464 --> 03:02:04.474
to kind of, "Careful with that!

03:02:04.474 --> 03:02:07.292
"Oh, well, there's sort of--

03:02:08.164 --> 03:02:11.704
"Oh, this is a sticky situation.

03:02:12.795 --> 03:02:13.844
"Mm."

03:02:13.844 --> 03:02:14.677
SAM: It's going to be fine.

03:02:14.677 --> 03:02:17.044
Maybe you should calm his emotions.

03:02:17.044 --> 03:02:20.874
TALIESIN: Actually, that would give you an excuse

03:02:20.874 --> 03:02:23.034
of how you guys weren't involved,

03:02:23.034 --> 03:02:26.314
because we gave you a whammy,

03:02:26.314 --> 03:02:29.604
so then you would have a very true story

03:02:29.604 --> 03:02:31.024
of how things went down.

03:02:31.024 --> 03:02:32.564
MATT: "What's a whammy?"

03:02:32.564 --> 03:02:34.744
TALIESIN: I'm just going to make you feel a little better

03:02:34.744 --> 03:02:36.494
about what's happening right now.

03:02:36.494 --> 03:02:37.854
MATT: "Okay."

03:02:37.854 --> 03:02:39.184
TALIESIN: Calm Emotions.

03:02:39.184 --> 03:02:40.707
MATT: "Ooh, that's much nicer.

03:02:42.044 --> 03:02:42.877
"Okay."

03:02:45.724 --> 03:02:47.682
TALIESIN: So yeah, if you can think of anything

03:02:47.682 --> 03:02:50.194
that might help. Honestly, even if touching something

03:02:50.194 --> 03:02:51.184
would trigger an alarm

03:02:51.184 --> 03:02:52.554
that would wake him up, maybe?

03:02:52.554 --> 03:02:53.387
I don't know.

03:02:53.387 --> 03:02:54.474
MATT: "Well, you haven't been too specific.

03:02:54.474 --> 03:02:56.377
"Are you just trying to defend the tower,

03:02:56.377 --> 03:02:58.744
"or are you trying to go somewhere?"

03:02:58.744 --> 03:03:00.984
LAURA: Well, ultimately, we need to get out of here.

03:03:00.984 --> 03:03:02.344
LIAM: Yes, best case scenario.
TRAVIS: Out of than Nicodranas.

03:03:02.344 --> 03:03:05.014
LAURA: Yes
SAM: First priority, get out,

03:03:05.014 --> 03:03:07.954
and if we can't find anything that can do that, then defend.

03:03:07.954 --> 03:03:09.434
MATT: "Uh."

03:03:09.434 --> 03:03:12.574
And with your investigation roll,

03:03:12.574 --> 03:03:14.335
he begins to help you go through some elements,

03:03:14.335 --> 03:03:18.074
and you get the sense that, for one thing,

03:03:18.074 --> 03:03:21.087
a lot of the text in a lot of the books here,

03:03:22.354 --> 03:03:23.804
everything seems to be empty,

03:03:25.304 --> 03:03:27.414
just blank pages, but the books are all old,

03:03:27.414 --> 03:03:28.274
and you get the sense

03:03:28.274 --> 03:03:33.014
that a lot of this is hidden intentionally.

03:03:33.014 --> 03:03:36.044
But Wensforth gets an idea.

03:03:36.044 --> 03:03:38.775
He goes, "I remember one thing I was cataloging

03:03:38.775 --> 03:03:41.370
"maybe, like, five years ago.

03:03:41.370 --> 03:03:42.782
"Might've been used, though.

03:03:42.782 --> 03:03:44.443
"Here, see if you can help me look for it."

03:03:44.443 --> 03:03:45.276
LIAM: Of course, of course.

03:03:45.276 --> 03:03:46.414
MATT: And you head up to one of the side,

03:03:46.414 --> 03:03:48.064
additional towers. It comes at an odd angle.

03:03:48.064 --> 03:03:49.064
It's like a spiral staircase

03:03:49.064 --> 03:03:50.224
that gets wider, and then shorter,

03:03:50.224 --> 03:03:51.057
then wider, and shorter,

03:03:51.057 --> 03:03:52.324
like you're climbing at an odd angle,

03:03:52.324 --> 03:03:53.754
and then up for a bit,

03:03:53.754 --> 03:03:56.504
that you don't recall seeing from the outside.

03:03:56.504 --> 03:03:58.734
And as you head up into this area,

03:03:58.734 --> 03:04:00.894
it's like a musty attic.

03:04:00.894 --> 03:04:03.974
There are sheets, and tapestries,

03:04:03.974 --> 03:04:08.974
and blankets that all smell of old dust and mothballs,

03:04:09.084 --> 03:04:12.244
and pulling through some of the areas there,

03:04:12.244 --> 03:04:15.254
you can see there's a glass case

03:04:15.254 --> 03:04:18.717
that has a little metallic emblem.

03:04:20.294 --> 03:04:22.113
Make a history check for me.

03:04:22.113 --> 03:04:23.129
SAM: Come on, Caleb.

03:04:24.364 --> 03:04:26.534
LIAM: Nah, not as good as anything I've done tonight.

03:04:26.534 --> 03:04:27.933
15.
MATT: 15?

03:04:27.933 --> 03:04:29.617
You do not recognize the emblem at all,

03:04:31.124 --> 03:04:34.924
but within this glass case next to the emblem,

03:04:34.924 --> 03:04:39.554
you see a cylindrical, silver,

03:04:39.554 --> 03:04:42.504
or at least polished metal case about that long.

03:04:42.504 --> 03:04:45.284
Looks almost like a cigar, if you will.

03:04:45.284 --> 03:04:48.224
And he goes, "Ah, this was a gift to the master

03:04:48.224 --> 03:04:50.182
"from the Pansophical.

03:04:55.554 --> 03:04:57.462
"I think it might help."

03:04:58.534 --> 03:05:01.204
(glass shattering) He just throws it on the ground.

03:05:01.204 --> 03:05:03.434
The glass case shatters open,

03:05:03.434 --> 03:05:05.584
the emblem scatters across the ground in the middle,

03:05:05.584 --> 03:05:08.891
then rolls and stops against some of the broken glass,

03:05:08.891 --> 03:05:09.724
and he, "Ah."

03:05:11.599 --> 03:05:12.432
LIAM: Do you have any knowledge

03:05:12.432 --> 03:05:13.794
of what this is?
MATT: "You did that."

03:05:13.794 --> 03:05:15.799
LIAM: Yes, yes, it was all me.

03:05:15.799 --> 03:05:17.122
MATT: "Maybe."

03:05:17.122 --> 03:05:18.064
Hands it to you.

03:05:18.064 --> 03:05:19.496
LIAM: Can you tell me anything about it?

03:05:19.496 --> 03:05:20.630
Or is it up to me?

03:05:20.630 --> 03:05:21.874
MATT: "I know it was given to him

03:05:21.874 --> 03:05:24.407
"by someone who jumped from place to place.

03:05:25.434 --> 03:05:29.204
"The master said it was sort of an emergency."

03:05:29.204 --> 03:05:30.554
LIAM: Think we have 10 minutes?

03:05:31.814 --> 03:05:32.888
SAM: Maybe.

03:05:32.888 --> 03:05:33.721
LAURA: You can try.

03:05:33.721 --> 03:05:34.662
SAM: Can you just look at it

03:05:34.662 --> 03:05:35.674
and see if you glean anything

03:05:35.674 --> 03:05:36.944
just from first sight?

03:05:36.944 --> 03:05:38.124
LIAM: Eh.

03:05:38.124 --> 03:05:40.514
MATT: It's a metal case, but you do see

03:05:40.514 --> 03:05:41.347
it has a--

03:05:41.347 --> 03:05:42.524
LIAM: Is it a scroll case?

03:05:42.524 --> 03:05:43.357
MARISHA: Scroll?

03:05:43.357 --> 03:05:45.104
MATT: It looks too small for a scroll case,

03:05:45.104 --> 03:05:46.654
but you see, it's not a solid cylinder.

03:05:46.654 --> 03:05:48.304
When you pick it up, you can see lines along the edges

03:05:48.304 --> 03:05:51.114
that do make you believe that it could be opened.

03:05:51.114 --> 03:05:52.374
LIAM: Okay.

03:05:52.374 --> 03:05:53.207
SAM: Let's open it.

03:05:54.214 --> 03:05:55.047
LIAM: No time.

03:05:55.984 --> 03:05:57.564
MATT: You don't quite see where to open it.

03:05:57.564 --> 03:05:59.842
LIAM: Oh, I see, I see, I see, I see.

03:05:59.842 --> 03:06:01.817
SAM: Give it to me.
MATT: Make an investigation check,

03:06:01.817 --> 03:06:03.007
or you can do it, either one.

03:06:03.007 --> 03:06:03.840
TALIESIN: d4.

03:06:03.840 --> 03:06:06.257
LIAM: (fake crying)

03:06:08.084 --> 03:06:09.034
15 again.

03:06:09.034 --> 03:06:09.867
MATT: 15.

03:06:11.144 --> 03:06:12.704
You have no idea how this works.

03:06:12.704 --> 03:06:13.850
SAM: Gimme.
LIAM: You two, come.

03:06:13.850 --> 03:06:14.867
SAM: Gimme!

03:06:14.867 --> 03:06:18.444
All right, I will try to see

03:06:18.444 --> 03:06:20.974
if I can use some thieves' tools

03:06:20.974 --> 03:06:22.344
to find an edge,

03:06:22.344 --> 03:06:24.918
and pry a side, or see if I can--

03:06:24.918 --> 03:06:27.964
MARISHA: I backseat driver over Veth's shoulder,

03:06:27.964 --> 03:06:29.044
and give her advantage.

03:06:29.044 --> 03:06:31.409
MATT: Okay, if you're helping have advantage

03:06:31.409 --> 03:06:33.092
on the investigation check, the DC is higher

03:06:33.092 --> 03:06:34.572
since this is another attempt, but go for it.

03:06:34.572 --> 03:06:36.515
SAM: Can you also bless me or something?

03:06:36.515 --> 03:06:37.864
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm giving you Bless.

03:06:37.864 --> 03:06:39.155
LAURA: Guidance.
MATT: Or Guidance.

03:06:39.155 --> 03:06:40.988
TALIESIN: Guidance.
SAM: Guidanced.

03:06:42.874 --> 03:06:44.540
What am I doing? Investigation?

03:06:44.540 --> 03:06:46.274
TRAVIS: With advantage.
LIAM: And advantage with Bless.

03:06:46.274 --> 03:06:48.564
SAM: Mm-hmm, 29.

03:06:48.564 --> 03:06:49.944
MATT: 29.

03:06:49.944 --> 03:06:52.224
The two sides of it, you realize,

03:06:52.224 --> 03:06:55.904
have these very faint little pinhole buttons,

03:06:55.904 --> 03:06:57.814
and as you discover them,

03:06:57.814 --> 03:06:59.374
you push in both, and it (clicking)

03:06:59.374 --> 03:07:01.584
snaps open, and on the inside,

03:07:01.584 --> 03:07:05.353
you see a piece of vellum that is wound very tightly

03:07:05.353 --> 03:07:09.606
in a very, very compact scroll of some kind.

03:07:10.534 --> 03:07:12.084
SAM: I'll unfurl it?

03:07:12.084 --> 03:07:13.067
MARISHA: A baby scroll.

03:07:14.234 --> 03:07:15.347
LIAM: Caleb leans over.

03:07:16.564 --> 03:07:21.564
MATT: As you unfurl, it's-- what languages do you speak?

03:07:21.854 --> 03:07:24.464
SAM: Just Goblin and Halfling.

03:07:24.464 --> 03:07:27.014
MATT: Okay, yeah, so you do not recognize the language.

03:07:29.364 --> 03:07:31.164
LIAM: Sylvan, Celestial?

03:07:31.164 --> 03:07:32.180
MATT: Nope.
MARISHA: Deep Speech,

03:07:32.180 --> 03:07:34.234
Undercommon, Halfling, Dwarvish.

03:07:34.234 --> 03:07:35.743
MATT: Nope.
SAM: Thieves' Cant.

03:07:35.743 --> 03:07:37.174
ASHLEY: Abyssal, Celestial.

03:07:37.174 --> 03:07:38.007
MATT: Nope.

03:07:38.007 --> 03:07:39.924
TALIESIN: Elvish, Giant, and Sylvan.

03:07:39.924 --> 03:07:40.757
MATT: Nope.

03:07:40.757 --> 03:07:41.590
LAURA: Infernal?

03:07:41.590 --> 03:07:42.474
MATT: Nope.

03:07:42.474 --> 03:07:43.891
SAM: Fjord, come on.

03:07:46.232 --> 03:07:47.065
TRAVIS: Nuh-uh.

03:07:47.065 --> 03:07:48.614
(laughter)

03:07:48.614 --> 03:07:49.447
LIAM: Shit.
SAM: You never learned

03:07:49.447 --> 03:07:50.280
a second language?

03:07:50.280 --> 03:07:52.364
LIAM: I sit down and start working on Comprehend Languages,

03:07:52.364 --> 03:07:54.767
which will take me 10 to do.

03:07:55.744 --> 03:07:56.936
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: Yeah.

03:07:57.924 --> 03:07:59.556
MATT: All right.

03:07:59.556 --> 03:08:00.974
LIAM: I might pass.

03:08:00.974 --> 03:08:03.494
MATT: As you're unrolling it still, it is very long.

03:08:03.494 --> 03:08:04.704
Like, the text continues,

03:08:04.704 --> 03:08:08.197
and as you reach this lengthy,

03:08:08.197 --> 03:08:09.644
three-and-a-half-foot element,

03:08:09.644 --> 03:08:13.194
it comes to an end, something falls out of the final bit,

03:08:13.194 --> 03:08:15.354
a long metal rod that (clanging)

03:08:15.354 --> 03:08:16.187
hits the ground,

03:08:16.187 --> 03:08:21.187
and has this gentle, fiery,

03:08:21.819 --> 03:08:24.097
reddish ember glow to it.

03:08:24.097 --> 03:08:25.297
MARISHA: Is it a tuning fork?

03:08:27.724 --> 03:08:29.637
SAM: Do you know how to use this, Caleb?

03:08:30.954 --> 03:08:34.294
LIAM: I'm busy making sure that I can read it,

03:08:34.294 --> 03:08:37.324
but I have a suspicion, and it doesn't seem fun.

03:08:37.324 --> 03:08:39.164
LAURA: I'm just going to show it to my mom,

03:08:39.164 --> 03:08:41.287
and see if she knows the language.

03:08:42.493 --> 03:08:45.084
Do you know what it says?

03:08:45.084 --> 03:08:47.944
MATT: "I, unfortunately, do not know this.

03:08:47.944 --> 03:08:49.374
"It's very nice handwriting."

03:08:49.374 --> 03:08:50.963
LAURA: It is very beautiful, yeah.

03:08:50.963 --> 03:08:54.864
SAM: Bluud, Bluud, what languages do you speak?

03:08:54.864 --> 03:08:55.697
Is Bluud with us?

03:08:55.697 --> 03:08:56.783
MATT: No, he did not come with you.

03:08:56.783 --> 03:08:58.064
(laughter)

03:08:58.064 --> 03:08:59.644
TALIESIN: Is there a window in this tower?

03:08:59.644 --> 03:09:01.294
LIAM: Luc, what does it say?

03:09:01.294 --> 03:09:03.354
MATT: There are numerous windows in this tower.

03:09:03.354 --> 03:09:04.224
SAM: 3P0.

03:09:04.224 --> 03:09:05.994
MATT: The room that you're in right now, no.

03:09:05.994 --> 03:09:07.434
It is like a compact attic,

03:09:07.434 --> 03:09:08.794
and by the way, the fact that you guys are all in there,

03:09:08.794 --> 03:09:12.327
except for you, it's pretty cramped in that space,

03:09:13.214 --> 03:09:14.974
but now that you found what you're looking for,

03:09:14.974 --> 03:09:16.844
it seems possibly, or something that might help,

03:09:16.844 --> 03:09:19.324
you can bring it back down into the main laboratory.

03:09:19.324 --> 03:09:22.604
LAURA: I'm going to just hover over Yussa,

03:09:22.604 --> 03:09:26.004
and keep poking him in the most annoying sort of ways,

03:09:26.004 --> 03:09:27.644
like, try to tickle him under his armpits,

03:09:27.644 --> 03:09:29.874
anything to try to wake him up.

03:09:29.874 --> 03:09:31.904
MATT: Okay, does not seem to be reacting.

03:09:31.904 --> 03:09:33.244
LAURA: I'm just going to keep going.

03:09:33.244 --> 03:09:35.252
SAM: Draw a dick on his face.

03:09:35.252 --> 03:09:37.604
LAURA: Well, I don't think that will wake him up,

03:09:37.604 --> 03:09:39.619
you know, but it'll be really funny.

03:09:41.797 --> 03:09:44.580
MATT: Okay, so

03:09:45.797 --> 03:09:48.663
as you finish your Comprehend Languages,

03:09:48.663 --> 03:09:50.564
you get it immediately as Draconic,

03:09:50.564 --> 03:09:51.914
or a variation of Draconic,

03:09:53.084 --> 03:09:55.654
and it is a spell scroll.

03:09:55.654 --> 03:09:57.288
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: It is a Plane Shift spell scroll.

03:09:57.288 --> 03:09:58.754
LIAM: Plane Shift, that's what I thought,

03:09:58.754 --> 03:10:00.954
and this tuning fork, I think,

03:10:00.954 --> 03:10:02.654
is going to take us someplace hot,

03:10:03.714 --> 03:10:05.367
but not quite as hot as this place,

03:10:05.367 --> 03:10:09.004
so who wants to go to Hell, or the Plane of Fire,

03:10:09.004 --> 03:10:10.945
or I'm not entirely sure.

03:10:10.945 --> 03:10:12.754
SAM: Can it take all of us?

03:10:12.754 --> 03:10:15.744
Can you tell by the scroll if it can take...

03:10:15.744 --> 03:10:17.424
There's more than 10 of us here.

03:10:17.424 --> 03:10:19.334
TRAVIS: And if we rest, someone can get us back?

03:10:19.334 --> 03:10:20.954
MARISHA: Yeah, that's an excellent point.

03:10:20.954 --> 03:10:22.821
We are with Yeza.
TALIESIN: We have the tuning forks, right?

03:10:22.821 --> 03:10:23.764
LAURA: We do have-- yeah,

03:10:23.764 --> 03:10:26.504
we have a thing tuned to this plane.

03:10:26.504 --> 03:10:31.504
SAM: We have 10 people, not including Bluud.

03:10:31.569 --> 03:10:32.402
LAURA: Bluud isn't with us.

03:10:32.402 --> 03:10:34.235
SAM: Carlos.
LAURA: Bluud ran, they ran.

03:10:34.235 --> 03:10:35.143
SAM: They ran?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:10:35.143 --> 03:10:37.408
SAM: So it's just 10 of us.
LIAM: It's just three plus us.

03:10:37.408 --> 03:10:38.358
SAM: That's 10.
MATT: Correct.

03:10:38.358 --> 03:10:39.384
SAM: We're the Mighty 10.

03:10:39.384 --> 03:10:41.128
MATT: "You and up to eight willing creatures."

03:10:41.128 --> 03:10:43.795
(groaning)

03:10:46.074 --> 03:10:47.624
MARISHA: I mean, yeah, is it a good idea

03:10:47.624 --> 03:10:50.464
to take Luc into the Plane of Fire, too?

03:10:50.464 --> 03:10:53.154
LAURA: Well, we're not going to
leave Luc here at this tower.

03:10:53.154 --> 03:10:54.504
MARISHA: That's what I'm saying,

03:10:54.504 --> 03:10:57.344
so we would be taking him someplace hot,

03:10:57.344 --> 03:10:59.057
and potentially very deadly.

03:11:02.284 --> 03:11:03.387
Wensforth.

03:11:03.387 --> 03:11:04.964
SAM: We're not going to leave him here alone.

03:11:04.964 --> 03:11:06.704
MARISHA: I'm not suggesting that at all.

03:11:06.704 --> 03:11:09.164
I'm suggesting we have to find another solution

03:11:09.164 --> 03:11:11.927
that's not teleporting to a plane made of flame.

03:11:12.954 --> 03:11:16.004
SAM: Can two of us go elsewhere?

03:11:16.004 --> 03:11:19.364
LAURA: Who was it that gave this to you?

03:11:19.364 --> 03:11:21.264
MATT: (as Wensforth) "It wasn't given to me in particular.

03:11:21.264 --> 03:11:22.614
"It was given to the master."

03:11:24.641 --> 03:11:27.319
MARISHA: Wensforth--
MATT: "It was the Pansophical, I think."

03:11:27.319 --> 03:11:29.694
TRAVIS: The priorities are the family members, right?

03:11:29.694 --> 03:11:34.454
Your husband and son, your mother, that's key.

03:11:34.454 --> 03:11:36.208
There are so many of us that can change our appearances,

03:11:36.208 --> 03:11:37.144
we can't be scryed on,

03:11:37.144 --> 03:11:38.114
we should split and scatter,

03:11:38.114 --> 03:11:39.574
and the family should be taken care of.

03:11:39.574 --> 03:11:41.044
MARISHA: I agree.

03:11:41.044 --> 03:11:45.244
Wensforth, is there an entrance to the sewer from here?

03:11:45.244 --> 03:11:46.374
Or nearby?

03:11:46.374 --> 03:11:50.364
Because we've actually had pretty extensive journeys

03:11:50.364 --> 03:11:52.214
in the sewer beneath Nicodranas.

03:11:52.214 --> 03:11:53.794
MATT: "I mean, likely.

03:11:53.794 --> 03:11:54.714
"I haven't been to it."

03:11:54.714 --> 03:11:56.684
MARISHA: No secret access in this tower?

03:11:56.684 --> 03:11:59.364
MATT: "No, why would we go in the sewer?"

03:11:59.364 --> 03:12:00.197
MARISHA: Fair.

03:12:00.861 --> 03:12:02.683
TRAVIS: Do you have a shitter?

03:12:02.683 --> 03:12:04.394
(chuckling)

03:12:04.394 --> 03:12:06.135
MATT: "I mean, yeah."

03:12:07.571 --> 03:12:09.094
ASHLEY: Is it just like, an open--?

03:12:10.191 --> 03:12:12.341
MATT: "No!"
SAM: You have to poop onto the ground?

03:12:12.341 --> 03:12:15.951
MARISHA: We got in last time by
taking a gate through the docks.

03:12:15.951 --> 03:12:19.571
Maybe trying to travel underground and getting out of city.

03:12:19.571 --> 03:12:21.741
SAM: Who's fast and--

03:12:21.741 --> 03:12:23.749
you and Fjord are pretty fast.

03:12:26.411 --> 03:12:28.001
Are you fast? You're fast.

03:12:28.001 --> 03:12:29.901
You're a fast runner.

03:12:29.901 --> 03:12:31.511
TALIESIN: Not quiet, though.

03:12:31.511 --> 03:12:33.074
SAM: No.
ASHLEY: 50 feet.

03:12:34.741 --> 03:12:35.574
And also--

03:12:35.574 --> 03:12:38.731
SAM: I don't know, but I'm just trying to think.

03:12:38.731 --> 03:12:40.951
We would need Caleb to come to this other plane

03:12:40.951 --> 03:12:42.101
to get us back.

03:12:42.101 --> 03:12:44.331
And I want to stay with my family.

03:12:44.331 --> 03:12:45.164
TALIESIN: That's a day.

03:12:45.164 --> 03:12:47.376
We would have to be there for a day.
MARISHA: We would have to sleep there.

03:12:47.376 --> 03:12:49.051
LIAM: I-I-I have an idea.

03:12:49.051 --> 03:12:49.884
SAM: What is it?

03:12:53.331 --> 03:12:57.014
LIAM: You all walk away from here and I wait outside.

03:12:58.261 --> 03:12:59.241
SAM: To talk?

03:12:59.241 --> 03:13:00.074
MARISHA: Why?

03:13:00.074 --> 03:13:03.194
TALIESIN: That seems like a terrible idea.
MARISHA: We went through--

03:13:03.194 --> 03:13:04.701
LIAM: What's the other idea you have?

03:13:04.701 --> 03:13:06.631
SAM: We split up.
MARISHA: Take the sewers.

03:13:06.631 --> 03:13:09.101
Get out of town, you know?

03:13:09.101 --> 03:13:11.931
Get out of town on foot,

03:13:11.931 --> 03:13:13.901
the old fashioned way.

03:13:13.901 --> 03:13:16.161
LAURA: Caleb, if they take you--

03:13:16.161 --> 03:13:17.374
SAM: What do we do?

03:13:17.374 --> 03:13:20.482
LAURA: We can't even get back to Eiselcross without you.

03:13:22.651 --> 03:13:25.016
SAM: Unless Yussa wakes up.

03:13:25.016 --> 03:13:26.341
But even if we got there,

03:13:26.341 --> 03:13:27.991
we can't do anything without Caleb.

03:13:27.991 --> 03:13:30.468
He's our--
TRAVIS: It's true.

03:13:30.468 --> 03:13:32.531
It's a noble thought.

03:13:32.531 --> 03:13:33.931
But we literally--

03:13:36.581 --> 03:13:41.467
LIAM: Maybe I convince them that they are needed.

03:13:42.901 --> 03:13:44.201
Maybe I convince them

03:13:44.201 --> 03:13:48.142
that there is something bigger than their petty grievances.

03:13:51.461 --> 03:13:54.836
SAM: And, what? They walk away
and say, "Okay, you're right"?

03:13:58.391 --> 03:14:01.873
LIAM: Maybe I trade your, um,

03:14:03.401 --> 03:14:04.948
safety for

03:14:08.491 --> 03:14:10.861
my obedience?

03:14:10.861 --> 03:14:13.771
TALIESIN: There is no safety without you.

03:14:13.771 --> 03:14:14.981
One week.

03:14:14.981 --> 03:14:15.814
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:14:16.731 --> 03:14:18.551
MARISHA: If they take you away,

03:14:18.551 --> 03:14:21.731
it means the next thing we're doing is a jail break.

03:14:21.731 --> 03:14:24.901
LAURA: Who knows how long that will take.
TRAVIS: That's super hard.

03:14:24.901 --> 03:14:26.791
I appreciate the notion.

03:14:26.791 --> 03:14:29.499
LIAM: They could send you. They could send you.

03:14:31.761 --> 03:14:35.821
TRAVIS: Or kill us, or pick us off one at a time.

03:14:35.821 --> 03:14:37.032
MARISHA: I don't think we're there yet.

03:14:37.032 --> 03:14:39.373
LIAM: I don't know what the other solution is yet.

03:14:39.373 --> 03:14:42.351
SAM: The other solution is four of you go to the sewers.

03:14:42.351 --> 03:14:44.471
TRAVIS: Yep. I'm one.

03:14:44.471 --> 03:14:45.991
You're two.
MARISHA: I'll go.

03:14:45.991 --> 03:14:48.071
TRAVIS: Who's three and four?
SAM: Or just three.

03:14:48.071 --> 03:14:49.811
ASHLEY: I can go.
TRAVIS: We have message spells.

03:14:49.811 --> 03:14:51.901
You can reach out and find us later. We'll disappear.

03:14:51.901 --> 03:14:53.261
I'm from the Menagerie Coast.

03:14:53.261 --> 03:14:54.541
I can get us on a ship.

03:14:54.541 --> 03:14:55.374
No problem.

03:14:55.374 --> 03:14:57.651
Go to Port Damali, whatever we need to do to hide out.

03:14:57.651 --> 03:14:59.148
Just make sure the family members are taken care of.

03:14:59.148 --> 03:15:02.141
You with your mother, you with your husband and your son.

03:15:02.141 --> 03:15:04.391
TALIESIN: I'll go wherever I'm needed.

03:15:04.391 --> 03:15:06.361
MARISHA: We can smuggle them out.

03:15:06.361 --> 03:15:08.851
If you guys want to stay here.

03:15:08.851 --> 03:15:11.941
Is that more or less your suggestion?

03:15:11.941 --> 03:15:13.721
TRAVIS: Yeah. Use the spell.

03:15:13.721 --> 03:15:15.271
They don't want us. They want you.

03:15:15.271 --> 03:15:19.831
And they want your mother and your family to squeeze.

03:15:19.831 --> 03:15:21.614
TALIESIN: And they can't find us.

03:15:21.614 --> 03:15:22.814
SAM: If we--

03:15:23.931 --> 03:15:28.600
If we go with us and Jester, we won't have a healer.

03:15:28.600 --> 03:15:30.600
MARISHA: (laughs)
SAM: Just kidding.

03:15:30.600 --> 03:15:33.341
(laughter)

03:15:33.341 --> 03:15:35.541
TALIESIN: I'll also say, how long have we been here?

03:15:36.510 --> 03:15:37.936
LIAM: Probably 20 minutes at this point.

03:15:37.936 --> 03:15:39.211
TALIESIN: Let's say 40 more minutes,

03:15:39.211 --> 03:15:41.119
and they will have attuned.

03:15:42.071 --> 03:15:44.211
Since they haven't really been doing anything.

03:15:44.211 --> 03:15:46.271
LIAM: They might know where
we are right this moment, though.

03:15:46.271 --> 03:15:47.351
SAM: They might be outside.

03:15:47.351 --> 03:15:48.701
Are there windows?

03:15:48.701 --> 03:15:49.534
TRAVIS: That is fair.

03:15:49.534 --> 03:15:51.511
Is there any way to see outside of this tree?

03:15:51.511 --> 03:15:54.251
Arcane means would be preferred,

03:15:54.251 --> 03:15:55.831
rather than sticking my head through a window.

03:15:55.831 --> 03:15:58.521
MATT: "Um, well,

03:15:58.521 --> 03:16:01.371
"the windows generally can be shifted by the master,

03:16:01.371 --> 03:16:02.947
"but he's not here."
SAM: Oh no!

03:16:02.947 --> 03:16:04.459
MATT: "But there are windows you can look through."

03:16:04.459 --> 03:16:06.591
TRAVIS: You don't have a spoon
you can look into and see outside,

03:16:06.591 --> 03:16:08.754
on a rotating, 180-degree axis?

03:16:08.754 --> 03:16:09.771
SAM: That'd be a cool item.

03:16:09.771 --> 03:16:11.711
MARISHA: That is a really cool item.

03:16:11.711 --> 03:16:14.851
MATT: "I don't, but I'll ask the master when he comes back."

03:16:14.851 --> 03:16:17.061
TALIESIN: I have a terrible idea.

03:16:17.061 --> 03:16:18.321
MARISHA: It better be a good, terrible idea.

03:16:18.321 --> 03:16:19.793
SAM: Blow up the tower?

03:16:19.793 --> 03:16:21.061
MATT: "What--"
TALIESIN: We can hide them

03:16:21.061 --> 03:16:23.751
in the one place we know they won't be able to find them.

03:16:23.751 --> 03:16:25.276
SAM: In the ball?

03:16:25.276 --> 03:16:26.321
TALIESIN: (sighs)

03:16:26.321 --> 03:16:27.344
Just for a little while.

03:16:27.344 --> 03:16:29.261
MARISHA: Caduceus!
SAM: Wait!

03:16:29.261 --> 03:16:30.221
Wait!

03:16:30.221 --> 03:16:32.191
What if some of us went in the ball,

03:16:32.191 --> 03:16:34.061
and then we could carry it as an object

03:16:34.061 --> 03:16:36.790
through this plane-shifting thing.

03:16:36.790 --> 03:16:38.601
TRAVIS: (laughs) That's actually--

03:16:38.601 --> 03:16:40.391
Both of those are good ideas.

03:16:40.391 --> 03:16:43.178
SAM: I don't remember how to get out of the ball.

03:16:43.178 --> 03:16:44.571
MARISHA: And the problem is, is that--

03:16:44.571 --> 03:16:46.643
TRAVIS: You had to make it to an exit.
SAM: Is there time-bending stuff?

03:16:46.643 --> 03:16:47.900
MARISHA: The time-bending stuff.
SAM: Ooh, yeah.

03:16:47.900 --> 03:16:50.571
ASHLEY: Yeah, but you go in the ball
and can't, like, two years pass?

03:16:50.571 --> 03:16:52.230
MARISHA: Weeks. It could be weeks.

03:16:52.230 --> 03:16:55.806
MATT: Well, if you're in the ball, time passes quickly.

03:16:56.801 --> 03:16:58.568
ASHLEY: Time-- it feels normal to you.

03:16:58.568 --> 03:16:59.611
How it's passing?

03:16:59.611 --> 03:17:01.021
MATT: Correct.

03:17:01.021 --> 03:17:02.541
If you're out of the ball, it goes quick.

03:17:02.541 --> 03:17:04.861
So a person who's clutching the ball
and trying to hide it out,

03:17:04.861 --> 03:17:07.041
in this theoretical circumstance,

03:17:07.041 --> 03:17:10.051
for them, what would have been 30 minutes

03:17:10.051 --> 03:17:12.786
could be, like, 30 seconds to a minute--

03:17:12.786 --> 03:17:14.971
MARISHA: Eight hours? Oh.
MATT: -- for whoever's in there.

03:17:14.971 --> 03:17:17.251
LAURA: So really only a couple people
need to go in the ball,

03:17:17.251 --> 03:17:20.208
so that we can carry those people through to the next thing.

03:17:20.208 --> 03:17:22.581
And then we can get those people out of the ball?

03:17:22.581 --> 03:17:24.809
Do we know how to get people out of the ball?

03:17:24.809 --> 03:17:25.881
MATT: You know how to get out from the inside,

03:17:25.881 --> 03:17:27.881
so somebody would have to,

03:17:27.881 --> 03:17:29.561
would either have a spell to get them out,

03:17:29.561 --> 03:17:32.872
or to find one of the exits that you're aware of.

03:17:32.872 --> 03:17:34.721
SAM: Oof!

03:17:34.721 --> 03:17:36.261
TRAVIS: Yeah, it drops you in the study.

03:17:36.261 --> 03:17:39.121
And then it's a thing.

03:17:39.121 --> 03:17:41.224
Right?
SAM: You can't just get out.

03:17:41.224 --> 03:17:44.471
ASHLEY: Is the happy fun ball safer
than going to the fire plane?

03:17:44.471 --> 03:17:47.069
LAURA: Well, we don't know if it's
a fire plane, it could be--

03:17:47.069 --> 03:17:49.170
it could be the fey realm, it could be any plane.

03:17:49.170 --> 03:17:50.931
SAM: Dalen's Closet.
TRAVIS: I love little, shiny things that are red.

03:17:50.931 --> 03:17:52.864
LIAM: Does the scroll

03:17:52.864 --> 03:17:56.801
indicate where the tuning fork is?

03:17:56.801 --> 03:17:57.801
MATT: No.
LIAM: No?

03:17:57.801 --> 03:17:59.101
MATT: The scroll's just a spell.

03:17:59.101 --> 03:18:00.911
LIAM: And the turning fork, is the tuning fork.

03:18:00.911 --> 03:18:02.871
MATT: Yes.
LIAM: Sweet.

03:18:02.871 --> 03:18:04.070
MARISHA: You were going to try--

03:18:04.070 --> 03:18:05.829
identifying it would take too long?

03:18:05.829 --> 03:18:07.681
LIAM: Take me 10 minutes.

03:18:07.681 --> 03:18:08.941
MARISHA: Try and identify it.

03:18:08.941 --> 03:18:10.531
TALIESIN: Roll it.

03:18:10.531 --> 03:18:11.795
TRAVIS: I'll go to one of the windows.

03:18:11.795 --> 03:18:14.461
(fart noise)
ASHLEY: Sorry.

03:18:14.461 --> 03:18:15.498
SAM: Is that a nervous hand fart?

03:18:15.498 --> 03:18:18.063
ASHLEY: That's something I do when I get nervous.

03:18:18.063 --> 03:18:20.374
LAURA: I think we should just get out of here.

03:18:20.374 --> 03:18:21.761
I think we're giving it too much time,

03:18:21.761 --> 03:18:23.654
and they're going to figure out how to get into this tower.

03:18:23.654 --> 03:18:24.487
LIAM: I do, too.

03:18:24.487 --> 03:18:26.558
TALIESIN: It's going to be hard to get into here, but yeah,

03:18:26.558 --> 03:18:28.581
let's wait till we know that they know where we are.

03:18:28.581 --> 03:18:30.171
TRAVIS: Quick question, is the tuning fork instantaneous,

03:18:30.171 --> 03:18:31.451
if you read the scroll?

03:18:31.451 --> 03:18:32.818
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:18:32.818 --> 03:18:34.934
That's the fallback.
ASHLEY and MARISHA: Yeah.

03:18:34.934 --> 03:18:37.951
TRAVIS: If they breach this tower, you motherfuckers run.

03:18:37.951 --> 03:18:38.784
No questions.
LAURA: Well, we have to be able to

03:18:38.784 --> 03:18:40.041
read the scroll. Right?

03:18:40.041 --> 03:18:41.461
LIAM: I can read the scroll.

03:18:41.461 --> 03:18:43.301
SAM: For the next hour.
LAURA: Oh, okay.

03:18:43.301 --> 03:18:44.631
TALIESIN: We're good.
TRAVIS: Let's check the window

03:18:44.631 --> 03:18:46.811
and everything else we were saying we were doing.

03:18:46.811 --> 03:18:47.644
SAM: Oh shit.
MATT: Okay.

03:18:47.644 --> 03:18:49.665
So make a perception check as you glance out the window.

03:18:49.665 --> 03:18:50.498
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:18:50.498 --> 03:18:51.754
LIAM: And I begin to identify the tuning fork.

03:18:51.754 --> 03:18:53.951
TRAVIS: Caduceus, as well. Yes, please.
TALIESIN: Yep.

03:18:53.951 --> 03:18:54.891
MATT: Okay. Taking--

03:18:54.891 --> 03:18:57.581
MARISHA: So family would go in the ball, right?

03:18:57.581 --> 03:19:00.281
TALIESIN: 19.
LAURA: Or, no, family wouldn't go in the ball

03:19:00.281 --> 03:19:01.821
because they-- whoever's <i>in</i> the ball

03:19:01.821 --> 03:19:03.731
has to know how to get <i>out</i> of the ball.

03:19:03.731 --> 03:19:05.331
So we wouldn't want the family to be in there.

03:19:05.331 --> 03:19:09.171
The family would travel with Caleb and the tuning fork.

03:19:09.171 --> 03:19:10.411
And then--
LIAM: Yes.

03:19:10.411 --> 03:19:12.791
MARISHA: And hopefully this tuning fork takes us nowhere bad

03:19:12.791 --> 03:19:14.136
that might kill the family.
LAURA: Correct.

03:19:14.136 --> 03:19:15.201
SAM: If anyone goes in the ball,

03:19:15.201 --> 03:19:19.131
it has to be the most well-rested individuals.

03:19:19.131 --> 03:19:21.281
Who can get out safely.

03:19:21.281 --> 03:19:22.778
MARISHA: But that's also bananas

03:19:22.778 --> 03:19:24.731
because you might need the most well-rested people

03:19:24.731 --> 03:19:26.621
to defend in whatever plane this is.

03:19:26.621 --> 03:19:28.961
LAURA: I feel like the exhausted people go in the ball

03:19:28.961 --> 03:19:30.831
and they just sit down and rest,

03:19:30.831 --> 03:19:31.881
because it's going to be weeks.

03:19:31.881 --> 03:19:33.151
MARISHA: An eight-hour rest.

03:19:33.151 --> 03:19:35.919
SAM: Unless a golem comes and kills you in the ball.

03:19:35.919 --> 03:19:38.293
LIAM: Well, I can't go in the ball.
MATT: Man, this is a pickle.

03:19:38.293 --> 03:19:39.751
(laughter)

03:19:39.751 --> 03:19:42.721
LIAM: Caleb can't go in the ball
because Caleb needs to cast the spell.

03:19:42.721 --> 03:19:43.554
TALIESIN: Yeah.
LAURA: Yeah.

03:19:43.554 --> 03:19:46.741
LIAM: I think you, Beauregard,

03:19:46.741 --> 03:19:48.921
has the most history

03:19:48.921 --> 03:19:52.791
and access to knowledge of arcane shit,

03:19:52.791 --> 03:19:53.624
other than Caleb.

03:19:53.624 --> 03:19:55.511
TALIESIN: Without actually being arcane,

03:19:55.511 --> 03:19:57.561
which is a disadvantage in there.

03:19:58.491 --> 03:20:01.421
MARISHA: But I'm fresh.

03:20:01.421 --> 03:20:02.921
Figure out where this tuning fork goes.

03:20:02.921 --> 03:20:05.011
LIAM: You should go in with the families to protect them,

03:20:05.011 --> 03:20:06.781
and to have the knowledge to get out

03:20:06.781 --> 03:20:10.381
if Caleb can't be there to lend his advice

03:20:10.381 --> 03:20:11.301
for magical bullshit.

03:20:11.301 --> 03:20:13.689
LAURA: I don't want the families to go in the ball!

03:20:13.689 --> 03:20:16.741
The families can't go in the ball!

03:20:16.741 --> 03:20:19.771
MARISHA: Figure out where this tuning fork goes!
SAM: Your mom hasn't even been out of her house--

03:20:19.771 --> 03:20:21.321
TALIESIN: Keep figuring out where we're going.

03:20:21.321 --> 03:20:22.277
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:20:22.277 --> 03:20:23.110
TALIESIN: What do we see by the way?

03:20:23.110 --> 03:20:25.041
MATT: Well, you glance out from the edge of the window.

03:20:25.041 --> 03:20:26.641
You look down into the courtyard.

03:20:26.641 --> 03:20:28.731
This one perspective of the courtyard,

03:20:28.731 --> 03:20:31.221
a little bit south

03:20:31.221 --> 03:20:32.821
of where you came towards the tower,

03:20:32.821 --> 03:20:34.051
but you can make out the alley

03:20:34.051 --> 03:20:35.801
that you poked through to get here.

03:20:37.925 --> 03:20:40.624
Nothing that resembles the individuals that you--

03:20:41.671 --> 03:20:43.862
TRAVIS: Worried about?
MATT: Are worried about at the moment.

03:20:45.341 --> 03:20:48.847
SAM: Are there other individuals--?
MATT: But you do hear--

03:20:48.847 --> 03:20:51.014
(banging)

03:20:52.161 --> 03:20:53.581
SAM: What was that?

03:20:53.581 --> 03:20:55.514
TALIESIN: That's the door.
LAURA: Somebody's at the door.

03:20:55.514 --> 03:20:57.180
SAM: Okay.
LAURA: We just need to go.

03:20:57.180 --> 03:20:58.013
We just need to go.

03:20:58.013 --> 03:20:59.301
I'll go in the ball.

03:20:59.301 --> 03:21:00.134
SAM: We're doing the ball?

03:21:00.134 --> 03:21:02.581
Or we're doing this splitskies go in the sewers?

03:21:02.581 --> 03:21:03.931
ASHLEY: Or do we just talk to them?

03:21:03.931 --> 03:21:05.889
LAURA: Nope.
ASHLEY: No, we're not talking to them.

03:21:05.889 --> 03:21:07.136
(laughter)

03:21:07.136 --> 03:21:09.517
Just throwing it out there, just in case.

03:21:09.517 --> 03:21:11.192
TRAVIS: No, we ain't talking, we ain't talking.

03:21:11.192 --> 03:21:12.188
LIAM: Who's going in the ball?

03:21:12.188 --> 03:21:13.724
LAURA: I'll go in the ball.
SAM: We're doing the ball?

03:21:13.724 --> 03:21:14.620
LIAM: Yeah.

03:21:14.620 --> 03:21:16.051
LAURA: Mama is not going in the ball. Be safe.

03:21:16.051 --> 03:21:17.861
I don't remember how to get that on the ball, but--

03:21:17.861 --> 03:21:20.231
TALIESIN: We need someone who knows
how to get out of the ball.

03:21:20.231 --> 03:21:21.831
MARISHA: Well, everyone who's been in the ball

03:21:21.831 --> 03:21:23.661
knows how to get out of the ball, right?

03:21:23.661 --> 03:21:25.011
MATT: You hear from downstairs

03:21:25.011 --> 03:21:26.849
the voice of Wensforth go,

03:21:27.921 --> 03:21:30.211
"Who is it?"

03:21:30.211 --> 03:21:31.861
MARISHA: Fucking Wensforth.

03:21:31.861 --> 03:21:33.671
LIAM: Beauregard.
TALIESIN: Don't let them in.

03:21:33.671 --> 03:21:36.021
LIAM: Don't worry about fighting. These people can fight.

03:21:36.021 --> 03:21:39.491
I need your mind inside the ball. You have to go in.

03:21:41.021 --> 03:21:42.971
MARISHA: I think the exhausted people should go in, man.

03:21:42.971 --> 03:21:44.791
Everyone who's been in the ball knows how to get out.

03:21:44.791 --> 03:21:48.111
Especially if you just stay in the study and rest.

03:21:48.111 --> 03:21:50.931
LIAM: You're not the only one who is somewhat rested.

03:21:50.931 --> 03:21:52.862
I need your mind in there.

03:21:55.201 --> 03:21:57.271
MARISHA: Eight people can go in this teleport spell.

03:21:57.271 --> 03:21:58.931
No more people need to go in the ball

03:21:58.931 --> 03:21:59.951
then needs to go into the ball,

03:21:59.951 --> 03:22:01.468
as long as we have people who know how to get them out.

03:22:01.468 --> 03:22:03.851
TALIESIN: Was it the dragon room? Is that how we got out?

03:22:03.851 --> 03:22:05.751
SAM: Oh my god.
TRAVIS: That was one time.

03:22:05.751 --> 03:22:07.051
TALIESIN: There's no dragon anymore.

03:22:07.051 --> 03:22:08.101
TRAVIS: Nope.

03:22:08.101 --> 03:22:11.029
SAM: Maybe?
TALIESIN: Probably.

03:22:11.029 --> 03:22:12.991
MARISHA: All right, all right, I'll go in the ball.

03:22:12.991 --> 03:22:14.689
TALIESIN: Oh, this is such a bad idea.

03:22:14.689 --> 03:22:17.094
LIAM: We just need to move now.
SAM: This whole day is a bad idea.

03:22:17.094 --> 03:22:19.552
ASHLEY: Who all's going in the ball?

03:22:19.552 --> 03:22:20.385
You're going in the ball.

03:22:20.385 --> 03:22:21.441
TRAVIS: If you go in the ball,

03:22:21.441 --> 03:22:23.180
you'll get dropped in the study. There's one room.

03:22:23.180 --> 03:22:24.897
It's just the dragon exit. That's it.

03:22:24.897 --> 03:22:26.701
MARISHA: That's the way out.
TRAVIS: It's just one room.

03:22:26.701 --> 03:22:27.651
ASHLEY: There's one way out?
TRAVIS: You just have to remember

03:22:27.651 --> 03:22:29.051
which one goes to the drag--

03:22:29.051 --> 03:22:30.801
here, take the map! Who's going in?

03:22:32.391 --> 03:22:33.626
I've got the map.

03:22:33.626 --> 03:22:34.876
SAM: Are you going in? Where are you going?

03:22:34.876 --> 03:22:36.994
ASHLEY: I'll go in with Beau.
MARISHA: All right.

03:22:36.994 --> 03:22:38.721
SAM: Oh, you guys are just going to fucking make out.

03:22:38.721 --> 03:22:41.529
ASHLEY: Yeah, obviously, but it's fine!

03:22:41.529 --> 03:22:43.141
TRAVIS: You need at least one magic person

03:22:43.141 --> 03:22:44.891
to charge those glyphs in the dragon exit room.

03:22:44.891 --> 03:22:46.511
ASHLEY: That's not me.
TALIESIN: Oh.

03:22:46.511 --> 03:22:47.344
LAURA: Fuck.
SAM: Duecy.

03:22:47.344 --> 03:22:48.492
LAURA: I'll go!
TALIESIN: Are you sure?

03:22:48.492 --> 03:22:49.531
LAURA: I'll go.

03:22:49.531 --> 03:22:51.261
SAM: You don't have any magic!

03:22:51.261 --> 03:22:53.231
LAURA: It's going to be days in there!
ASHLEY: She can rest.

03:22:53.231 --> 03:22:54.371
SAM: Okay.

03:22:54.371 --> 03:22:57.371
MATT: At this point, you hear Wensforth saying,

03:22:57.371 --> 03:23:01.251
"I understand. But the master's not currently available.

03:23:01.251 --> 03:23:03.091
"Can I take a message?"

03:23:03.091 --> 03:23:05.591
LAURA: We have to open up the fucking ball.

03:23:05.591 --> 03:23:06.641
SAM: How we do that?

03:23:06.641 --> 03:23:08.061
LIAM: I open it.

03:23:08.061 --> 03:23:10.251
TALIESIN: We're going to give you one day.

03:23:10.251 --> 03:23:11.291
If you're not out in one day.

03:23:11.291 --> 03:23:13.581
SAM: If it's one day for us,
is it like a week for them?

03:23:13.581 --> 03:23:15.247
Or is it the opposite?
MARISHA: What is it, Matt?

03:23:15.247 --> 03:23:17.071
Will you explain that again?

03:23:17.071 --> 03:23:18.331
MATT: The time dilation,

03:23:18.331 --> 03:23:21.991
time goes by quicker when you're inside the sphere

03:23:21.991 --> 03:23:23.121
than it does outside.

03:23:23.121 --> 03:23:27.249
SAM: So if it's a day outside, how long is it inside?

03:23:27.249 --> 03:23:28.211
MATT: It can be many, many days.

03:23:28.211 --> 03:23:29.044
SAM: Okay.

03:23:30.075 --> 03:23:33.801
So can bring them back in 30 minutes,

03:23:33.801 --> 03:23:35.325
and maybe that's a whole day.

03:23:35.325 --> 03:23:36.893
MARISHA: On the inside, it could be many more days.
MATT: Correct.

03:23:36.893 --> 03:23:38.193
LIAM: Long time passes on the outside,

03:23:38.193 --> 03:23:39.376
while less time passes--
MATT: The times you've

03:23:39.376 --> 03:23:40.617
been there, you've been like,

03:23:40.617 --> 03:23:42.122
oh, I've been here for like a day or so.

03:23:42.122 --> 03:23:43.794
Then you left and everyone's like,
you've been gone for two weeks.

03:23:43.794 --> 03:23:47.051
LAURA: Oh, that's the reverse of what I'm thinking.

03:23:47.051 --> 03:23:49.382
MARISHA: That's bad.
LAURA: Oh, then I'm useless in there

03:23:49.382 --> 03:23:51.301
because I've got no spells, I shouldn't go.

03:23:51.301 --> 03:23:52.961
TALIESIN: We need someone magical.

03:23:52.961 --> 03:23:54.627
LIAM: I thought it was the other way around.
So then we can't do that.

03:23:54.627 --> 03:23:56.081
TRAVIS: We could just, teleport and scatter.

03:23:56.081 --> 03:23:57.998
MARISHA: Because then we'd be fucked in there for weeks.

03:23:57.998 --> 03:23:59.641
And then we miss everything.

03:23:59.641 --> 03:24:00.828
MATT: Well, no, no, no.

03:24:00.828 --> 03:24:02.611
No. Sorry to clarify this.

03:24:02.611 --> 03:24:04.251
I feel like there's miscommunication.

03:24:04.251 --> 03:24:06.771
Time passes faster when you're in the ball.

03:24:06.771 --> 03:24:08.431
Meaning, in the real world.

03:24:08.431 --> 03:24:11.211
So what should be like an hour,

03:24:11.211 --> 03:24:14.581
or a couple of hours inside the ball,

03:24:14.581 --> 03:24:16.581
is a day outside of it approximately.

03:24:16.581 --> 03:24:18.081
I've looked the math again.
MARISHA: Right.

03:24:18.081 --> 03:24:20.414
MATT: So whoever's outside of it--

03:24:23.031 --> 03:24:25.071
the people inside the sphere, time goes by quicker.

03:24:25.071 --> 03:24:27.521
So in theory, you could get a short rest,

03:24:27.521 --> 03:24:29.921
or a long rest in the inside of the sphere,

03:24:29.921 --> 03:24:31.634
for an hour outside of it.

03:24:32.511 --> 03:24:34.711
ASHLEY: And I don't think anybody would.

03:24:34.711 --> 03:24:35.931
If you were inside,

03:24:35.931 --> 03:24:39.121
I don't think you would miss what's going on outside

03:24:39.121 --> 03:24:41.671
because we could bamf you out.

03:24:41.671 --> 03:24:43.561
LAURA: It's the opposite of what you're saying, Matt.

03:24:43.561 --> 03:24:46.281
SAM: If an hour goes by outside,

03:24:46.281 --> 03:24:48.284
how many hours go by inside?

03:24:48.284 --> 03:24:49.900
ASHLEY: Could be days.
MATT: No!

03:24:49.900 --> 03:24:51.103
Many more.
SAM: Okay.

03:24:51.103 --> 03:24:52.294
MATT: That's what I'm saying. Yeah.

03:24:52.294 --> 03:24:54.021
TRAVIS: So a long rest inside the ball.

03:24:54.021 --> 03:24:56.591
MATT: Yes, time is going faster inside the ball.

03:24:56.591 --> 03:24:57.424
TALIESIN: Gotcha.

03:24:57.424 --> 03:24:59.351
MATT: So-- sorry.

03:24:59.351 --> 03:25:00.801
Time is going fast--

03:25:00.801 --> 03:25:03.451
It's just one of those weird things to describe.

03:25:03.451 --> 03:25:06.501
Because the way the architecture

03:25:06.501 --> 03:25:08.081
on the inside of the sphere is currently set,

03:25:08.081 --> 03:25:09.971
and nobody's found the device that controls

03:25:09.971 --> 03:25:11.724
the passage of time in there,

03:25:13.031 --> 03:25:16.681
currently it's set to accelerate the passage

03:25:16.681 --> 03:25:17.991
for anybody inside the sphere.

03:25:17.991 --> 03:25:20.321
That's why Halas basically wanted to skip through history.

03:25:20.321 --> 03:25:21.531
LAURA: Right.
MATT: For a period of time,

03:25:21.531 --> 03:25:23.981
if he wanted to keep it in that forward momentum.

03:25:24.961 --> 03:25:26.431
LAURA: You would get--
MARISHA: -- a short rest.

03:25:26.431 --> 03:25:28.141
LAURA: Yeah. It would be like an hour inside the ball

03:25:28.141 --> 03:25:29.711
would be a day outside of the ball.

03:25:29.711 --> 03:25:32.674
So whoever goes in is not going to be able to--

03:25:32.674 --> 03:25:33.616
MATT: Correct. Sorry.
TRAVIS: If you take a long rest

03:25:33.616 --> 03:25:35.366
in the ball, it'll be days outside.

03:25:35.366 --> 03:25:37.751
MARISHA: Because I remember Yasha thought we were dead

03:25:37.751 --> 03:25:40.051
because we went inside the ball for, like, two days.

03:25:40.051 --> 03:25:42.021
And she was like, you were gone for a week.

03:25:42.021 --> 03:25:43.051
MATT: Correct. Sorry.

03:25:43.051 --> 03:25:44.191
I was thinking of the idea of--

03:25:44.191 --> 03:25:48.011
if you're using the ball to try and get people

03:25:48.011 --> 03:25:49.051
out of harm's way.

03:25:49.051 --> 03:25:51.381
As long as people are outside, necessarily,

03:25:51.381 --> 03:25:52.441
they can help them out.

03:25:52.441 --> 03:25:54.571
But it depends on how quickly the people on the inside

03:25:54.571 --> 03:25:55.822
can make their way to the exit.

03:25:55.822 --> 03:25:57.871
TALIESIN: How many spells do we
need to activate the dragon room?

03:25:57.871 --> 03:25:59.631
LIAM: If you can go into the ball,

03:25:59.631 --> 03:26:01.991
and beeline for the exit--
TRAVIS: Two.

03:26:01.991 --> 03:26:03.171
TALIESIN: Any level?
LIAM: You don't rest.

03:26:03.171 --> 03:26:05.344
You go as quick as you can to the exit.

03:26:06.219 --> 03:26:08.314
That means that a day or so will pass for us.

03:26:08.314 --> 03:26:09.811
TRAVIS: I just used Eldritch Blast on both of them,

03:26:09.811 --> 03:26:11.425
and they charged up and it fed to the middle.

03:26:11.425 --> 03:26:13.533
LAURA: You should go, Fjord, you remember how to do it.
LIAM: Yeah?

03:26:13.533 --> 03:26:14.641
LAURA: Fjord should go.

03:26:14.641 --> 03:26:16.291
MARISHA: Okay, and then you guys are going to go

03:26:16.291 --> 03:26:19.171
to fuck-all and rest for a day?

03:26:19.171 --> 03:26:20.004
SAM: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Yes.

03:26:20.004 --> 03:26:21.239
TRAVIS: I've got the map. I'll go in with you.

03:26:21.239 --> 03:26:22.480
LIAM: Yes.
TRAVIS: You three.

03:26:22.480 --> 03:26:23.313
TRAVIS: Okay.
MARISHA: Okay.

03:26:23.313 --> 03:26:24.771
And we're taking the family members?

03:26:24.771 --> 03:26:25.801
LAURA: No.
SAM: No!

03:26:25.801 --> 03:26:26.634
LAURA: They're staying out.

03:26:26.634 --> 03:26:29.961
SAM: Do not take my son into that ball!

03:26:29.961 --> 03:26:32.571
TRAVIS: Put us in the ball!
MARISHA: Better hope the ball

03:26:32.571 --> 03:26:35.063
isn't as bad as wherever we're going.
LAURA: He's been opening the ball the whole

03:26:35.063 --> 03:26:37.279
fucking time this whole conversation is happening.

03:26:37.279 --> 03:26:38.954
SAM: Ball, or hell?
MARISHA: I mean, yeah, yeah.

03:26:38.954 --> 03:26:41.501
LIAM: So it's you three and four, right?

03:26:41.501 --> 03:26:43.383
Jester, Fjord, Beau, and Yasha going in?

03:26:43.383 --> 03:26:44.397
Is that it?
ASHLEY: Only two need to go in.

03:26:44.397 --> 03:26:45.781
MATT: You hear,

03:26:45.781 --> 03:26:47.501
"Excuse me! I'm sorry. You have to go!

03:26:47.501 --> 03:26:48.531
"You can't come in here!"

03:26:48.531 --> 03:26:49.521
LIAM: I'm opening it.

03:26:49.521 --> 03:26:50.851
I'm retracing my steps with the operation of the ball.

03:26:50.851 --> 03:26:53.111
SAM: I'll send a quick message to Wensforth saying,

03:26:53.111 --> 03:26:54.761
Wensforth, thank you so much for this.

03:26:54.761 --> 03:26:57.451
We will make this up to you.

03:26:57.451 --> 03:26:58.911
And then, I guess we go.

03:26:58.911 --> 03:27:01.228
MATT: Make an investigation check.

03:27:01.228 --> 03:27:02.799
LAURA: (stressed yell)

03:27:04.341 --> 03:27:06.394
LIAM: That is a 24.

03:27:07.981 --> 03:27:09.104
MATT: 24.

03:27:11.821 --> 03:27:12.871
MATT: Actually, you would have advantage on this,

03:27:12.871 --> 03:27:14.591
because you had done this before.

03:27:14.591 --> 03:27:16.021
LIAM: Yeah.
SAM: Oh, this is the ball.

03:27:16.021 --> 03:27:17.091
LIAM: Less, less.

03:27:17.091 --> 03:27:18.251
LAURA: -- but I'm guiding you.

03:27:18.251 --> 03:27:19.489
LIAM: Guiding me?

03:27:19.489 --> 03:27:21.341
Well, if I'm allowed the Guidance,

03:27:21.341 --> 03:27:23.911
the highest roll will be 27.

03:27:23.911 --> 03:27:25.211
MATT: 27. Okay.

03:27:25.211 --> 03:27:27.453
Normally you have to say that in advance.

03:27:29.121 --> 03:27:30.911
Because you trace the elements here,

03:27:30.911 --> 03:27:33.551
and there are multiple solutions to this in some degree,

03:27:33.551 --> 03:27:34.384
but the one that you know,

03:27:34.384 --> 03:27:36.581
that at least will bring you to a familiar space.

03:27:36.581 --> 03:27:38.731
You go ahead and start shifting the things.

03:27:40.041 --> 03:27:43.184
Eventually the ball clicks in and at that point,

03:27:44.951 --> 03:27:48.431
and you would know that it is a radial thing,

03:27:48.431 --> 03:27:49.341
from what happened before.

03:27:49.341 --> 03:27:51.391
So for those who are not going into the sphere,

03:27:51.391 --> 03:27:53.235
you would know as he's doing this to step back.

03:27:53.235 --> 03:27:54.068
SAM: Oh.

03:27:54.068 --> 03:27:56.010
LIAM: Do <i>I</i> need to step back from it?

03:27:56.010 --> 03:27:57.781
MATT: Well, step-- whoever--

03:27:57.781 --> 03:28:00.141
it's a radius around the sphere.

03:28:00.141 --> 03:28:01.401
TRAVIS: Hand me that fucking thing.

03:28:01.401 --> 03:28:02.841
LIAM: I toss it to Fjord and say:

03:28:02.841 --> 03:28:06.251
Turn that dial on the end and then press in on the bottom.

03:28:06.251 --> 03:28:07.373
TRAVIS: Ready?
LAURA: Be safe.

03:28:07.373 --> 03:28:09.331
MARISHA: Us three, right?
TALIESIN: Boom, boom, boom.

03:28:09.331 --> 03:28:10.361
ASHLEY: Them two?
MARISHA: All right.

03:28:10.361 --> 03:28:12.081
SAM: Luc, watch this.
TALIESIN: One, two, three.

03:28:12.081 --> 03:28:14.301
LIAM: Yeah.
MARISHA: You.

03:28:14.301 --> 03:28:15.521
TRAVIS: (crushing)

03:28:15.521 --> 03:28:16.571
Just us.
LAURA: Bye.

03:28:16.571 --> 03:28:17.751
ASHLEY: Us three. Us three?
LIAM: Yes.

03:28:17.751 --> 03:28:19.181
ASHLEY: Okay.
TALIESIN: All right.

03:28:19.181 --> 03:28:20.999
Do it, open the--
TRAVIS: I did it.

03:28:20.999 --> 03:28:22.242
TALIESIN: Open the door. Open the door.

03:28:22.242 --> 03:28:23.901
LAURA: I grab the ball, I'm holding onto the ball.

03:28:23.901 --> 03:28:25.443
SAM: The ball? Oh yeah.

03:28:25.443 --> 03:28:28.441
LIAM: I will use the scroll
instantaneously to open the gate.

03:28:28.441 --> 03:28:29.961
ASHLEY: (sighs)
MATT: Okay.

03:28:29.961 --> 03:28:31.851
It is a six-second casting time.

03:28:31.851 --> 03:28:33.681
LIAM: Okay.

03:28:33.681 --> 03:28:34.981
MARISHA: Oh my god!

03:28:34.981 --> 03:28:37.201
SAM: I think I can steal a few things from the room.

03:28:37.201 --> 03:28:39.971
MATT: So as you complete the final bit of the puzzle,

03:28:39.971 --> 03:28:41.771
it clicks in.

03:28:41.771 --> 03:28:42.841
The light brightens up.

03:28:42.841 --> 03:28:45.561
And there is a sudden flash,

03:28:45.561 --> 03:28:47.761
and everyone who was in the proximity of Fjord,

03:28:47.761 --> 03:28:49.471
who had chosen to go into the sphere,

03:28:49.471 --> 03:28:52.350
are gone and the ball just-- (clanging)

03:28:52.350 --> 03:28:53.533
onto the ground.
LAURA: I run over and grab the ball.

03:28:53.533 --> 03:28:54.516
I'm holding onto the ball.

03:28:54.516 --> 03:28:56.431
MATT: All right.

03:28:56.431 --> 03:28:58.591
And you are currently going through the scroll?

03:28:58.591 --> 03:28:59.640
LIAM: Yes.
MATT: Reading and reading it.

03:28:59.640 --> 03:29:00.473
As you're reading it,

03:29:00.473 --> 03:29:03.321
the fork is heating up, and heating up, and heating up.

03:29:03.321 --> 03:29:05.481
And it almost begins to burn your hand,

03:29:05.481 --> 03:29:07.631
as you're pulling it down.

03:29:07.631 --> 03:29:09.421
But it's a pain you're familiar with.

03:29:09.421 --> 03:29:11.231
And as you go to complete the spell,

03:29:11.231 --> 03:29:14.121
the door entryway opens up,

03:29:14.121 --> 03:29:16.071
and you see there, darting in,

03:29:17.101 --> 03:29:18.434
you see Astrid,

03:29:19.541 --> 03:29:21.391
who looks over and kind of, hand out.

03:29:24.981 --> 03:29:28.591
You know the presence here.

03:29:28.591 --> 03:29:32.992
This is the at-the-ready for a Counterspell.

03:29:36.801 --> 03:29:38.077
You finish reading.

03:29:39.251 --> 03:29:40.894
The rod begins to glow brightly.

03:29:42.481 --> 03:29:43.314
And--

03:29:44.564 --> 03:29:46.711
(whooshing)

03:29:46.711 --> 03:29:49.241
All of you feel yourselves being pulled from this reality,

03:29:49.241 --> 03:29:51.216
as her hand goes limp.

03:29:51.216 --> 03:29:53.241
TALIESIN: (sighs)

03:29:53.241 --> 03:29:55.576
SAM: She let us go.

03:29:55.576 --> 03:29:56.504
TRAVIS: Again.

03:29:56.504 --> 03:29:58.754
SAM: It's like Rolf in Sound Of Music.

03:29:58.754 --> 03:30:02.729
(laughter)

03:30:07.851 --> 03:30:10.221
MATT: And, because that's a fun cutting point,

03:30:10.221 --> 03:30:11.684
I'll go ahead and leave it there for tonight.

03:30:11.684 --> 03:30:13.543
SAM: No, Matt, no!
MARISHA: No, where are we?!

03:30:13.543 --> 03:30:14.470
MATT: (laughs)

03:30:14.470 --> 03:30:17.373
MARISHA: Where are we all?

03:30:17.373 --> 03:30:18.358
LIAM: Find out in a week?

03:30:18.358 --> 03:30:19.951
MATT: Yeah.
TALIESIN: I know where <i>you</i> are!

03:30:19.951 --> 03:30:21.761
TRAVIS: We'll figure it out live. Cool.

03:30:21.761 --> 03:30:23.594
MATT: Yeah, good to figure it out as we go.

03:30:23.594 --> 03:30:25.341
LIAM: Yeah, it's better to find out live.
MATT: That's what I figured.

03:30:25.341 --> 03:30:26.576
I was like, I could keep going,

03:30:26.576 --> 03:30:29.262
but I think we're right around the three-hour mark.

03:30:29.262 --> 03:30:31.082
LIAM: Oh, that's cool!
MATT: And I think

03:30:31.082 --> 03:30:33.903
it's a fun beat to pick up on next time.

03:30:33.903 --> 03:30:34.771
LIAM: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

03:30:34.771 --> 03:30:36.591
SAM: My bowels!
MARISHA: I know!

03:30:36.591 --> 03:30:39.066
My back is hurting from clenching.

03:30:39.066 --> 03:30:41.001
TALIESIN: We've been ran our butts off today.

03:30:41.001 --> 03:30:42.274
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:30:42.274 --> 03:30:45.732
LIAM: So intense from start to finish.
ASHLEY: This was high octane.

03:30:45.732 --> 03:30:46.741
(laughter)

03:30:46.741 --> 03:30:48.501
LAURA: That was such a fun idea.

03:30:48.501 --> 03:30:49.541
I hope it pays off.

03:30:49.541 --> 03:30:53.774
TALIESIN: I hope we don't lose three members of the party

03:30:53.774 --> 03:30:55.641
to the astral plane.
MATT: I'm not going to lie,

03:30:55.641 --> 03:30:57.031
it's pretty fucking clever.

03:30:57.031 --> 03:30:59.291
I was like, huh.

03:30:59.291 --> 03:31:01.281
We'll see how it pans out.

03:31:01.281 --> 03:31:02.941
MARISHA: Sorry, not to get too in the weeds

03:31:02.941 --> 03:31:04.601
about that time-passage thing.

03:31:04.601 --> 03:31:05.434
MATT: Oh! No, no, no.

03:31:05.434 --> 03:31:07.217
MARISHA: Wanted to make sure we weren't going to get fucked.

03:31:07.217 --> 03:31:09.676
MATT: It's important, yeah.
LIAM: That was out of story.

03:31:09.676 --> 03:31:11.274
MATT: That was entirely out of story.

03:31:11.274 --> 03:31:12.631
TALIESIN: I'd like to think we were all arguing

03:31:12.631 --> 03:31:14.291
amongst ourselves like, no time moves fast.

03:31:14.291 --> 03:31:15.491
Don't remember time moves fast?

03:31:15.491 --> 03:31:17.651
MATT: Yeah. I feel like we were arguing the same thing.

03:31:17.651 --> 03:31:21.027
And then, because we kept arguing about the same thing,

03:31:21.027 --> 03:31:23.511
I felt like I was explaining it wrong.

03:31:23.511 --> 03:31:25.661
And it turns out I ended up explaining it wrong

03:31:25.661 --> 03:31:26.961
while trying to re-explain it.

03:31:26.961 --> 03:31:29.304
Yeah. Anyway, we got there eventually
and that's what matters.

03:31:29.304 --> 03:31:32.504
LIAM: (stoner voice) If you think about it,
is time even real?

03:31:32.504 --> 03:31:33.876
MARISHA: It's a construct, man.

03:31:33.876 --> 03:31:35.291
Just like this golem over here

03:31:35.291 --> 03:31:38.256
that's about to eat our face.

03:31:38.256 --> 03:31:40.936
MATT: This all started with one errant fireball.

03:31:40.936 --> 03:31:43.886
(laughs)
LIAM: (sighs)

03:31:45.353 --> 03:31:46.736
MATT: Man, wow.

03:31:46.736 --> 03:31:48.431
TALIESIN: So you guys just book towards the exit now,

03:31:48.431 --> 03:31:49.947
and it should be more or less fine.

03:31:49.947 --> 03:31:51.830
MARISHA: Theoretically.
SAM: Sure, yeah.

03:31:51.830 --> 03:31:53.971
LIAM: That shit probably moves around.

03:31:53.971 --> 03:31:56.004
MARISHA: Yeah.
ASHLEY: There's a lot I didn't get to see.

03:31:56.004 --> 03:31:58.011
TRAVIS: I've really wanted to see the crystal mines.

03:31:58.011 --> 03:31:59.727
Maybe one stop wouldn't hurt.

03:31:59.727 --> 03:32:01.497
(laughter)

03:32:01.497 --> 03:32:02.471
MATT: So to clarify,

03:32:02.471 --> 03:32:04.071
to clarify the notes here so we have it,

03:32:04.071 --> 03:32:06.144
who went into the happy fun ball?

03:32:06.144 --> 03:32:07.265
TRAVIS: Beau. Yasha.

03:32:07.265 --> 03:32:08.161
SAM: Beau. Yasha, Fjord.

03:32:08.161 --> 03:32:09.551
LIAM: It's that fish date.

03:32:09.551 --> 03:32:10.491
MATT: You got it.
LIAM: Part two.

03:32:10.491 --> 03:32:11.511
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:32:11.511 --> 03:32:14.461
MATT: And then everyone else traveled to wherever it seems

03:32:14.461 --> 03:32:16.231
that rod is attuned to.

03:32:16.231 --> 03:32:17.451
All righty.

03:32:18.451 --> 03:32:20.751
Child and mother and Yeza in tow.

03:32:20.751 --> 03:32:22.491
LIAM: Rock and roll.
MATT: Fantastic.

03:32:22.491 --> 03:32:25.333
Well, we'll pick up from there next episode.

03:32:25.333 --> 03:32:27.434
(laughs)

03:32:27.434 --> 03:32:29.041
Thank you all for joining us.

03:32:29.041 --> 03:32:30.161
We love you very much.

03:32:30.161 --> 03:32:31.621
And is it Thursday yet?

03:32:31.621 --> 03:32:33.037
Good night.

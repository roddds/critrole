MATT: Hello, everyone,

00:00:00.983 --> 00:00:02.670
and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role,

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:04.040
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.809
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:08.392
ALL: (discordant yelling) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.046
TRAVIS: She yelled so loud at you. (laughs)

00:00:12.046 --> 00:00:14.170
MATT: I'm not used to not hearing Travis

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:15.787
blasting my face from this side.

00:00:15.787 --> 00:00:17.876
(laughter)

00:00:17.876 --> 00:00:19.458
SAM: What did she say?

00:00:19.458 --> 00:00:20.928
LAURA: I can't say it again!

00:00:20.928 --> 00:00:21.880
(laughter)

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:22.800
MATT: Okay.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.200
Well, regardless, thank you for joining us.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.530
Before we jump into tonight's episode,

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.520
we do have some sponsors and announcements to get through.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.580
The first of our sponsors tonight

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.400
of which is Twisted Taverns.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.233
Sam.

00:00:35.233 --> 00:00:36.770
SAM: Oh, hi there, folks.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.740
Welcome to the Old Shackle. Pull up a stool.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.660
You guys having a good time tonight?

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.076
Don't think I've seen you here before.

00:00:43.076 --> 00:00:44.100
(laughter)

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.870
Anyway, can I tell you our specials?

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.840
Tonight's house special is called Eldermancy,

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.250
and their ongoing campaign

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.350
called The Seeker's Guide to Twisted Taverns.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.900
A fifth edition book that contains

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.180
an extensive range of pre-made themed taverns

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.710
populated with exciting NPCs, quest hooks, menus,

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.690
and other fun elements to engage your players.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.210
Oh, what's that? You're closing out, ma'am?

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.410
Be right with you.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.340
Where was I? Oh yes.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.770
Eldermancy.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.200
Eldermancy. Yes, I'm saying it right.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.150
Cool.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.350
From the Arcane Wizard's Watering Hole

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.000
staffed entirely by animated objects,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.070
to The Underwater Drunken Treasure,

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.170
you'll have everything you need

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.660
to run the most fantastical adventures.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.100
Now, they didn't ask me to,

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.990
but I've created a signature cocktail

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.980
called the Eldermancy using the letters of their name.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.760
I'll make one for you right now.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.890
You can learn at home, and it's on the house.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.710
First, you take elderberry liquor.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.460
Just an ounce.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.810
Great. Next, lemon juice.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.650
Preferably freshly squeezed, but this'll work.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.780
And dry vermouth, just a splash.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.613
Okay. Good.

00:01:54.613 --> 00:01:57.000
Well, that was more than a splash, but whatever.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.840
Espresso. Now we're up to the E of Elde.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.380
This is espresso.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.560
MATT: No!
TRAVIS: Whoa, bro.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.920
SAM: R is rum.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.570
I got some light rum right here.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.163
Let's say a shot.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.280
M, mezcal tequila.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.570
Let's say two shots.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.340
MATT: What?!
LAURA: Oh god, Sam.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.320
SAM: Absinthe.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.700
Let's see three shots. Why not?

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.779
TALIESIN: Wow.
MARISHA: How much room is left?

00:02:21.779 --> 00:02:23.710
SAM: There we go.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:24.810
Newcastle Brown Ale.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.610
That's the N of Eldermancy.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:29.640
Let's just do a bunch.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.410
Sure. Cool.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.053
Cherry for garnish.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.790
They didn't give me a spoon, so there you go.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:36.623
(laughter)

00:02:36.623 --> 00:02:39.100
The Y will be yogurt.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.948
ALL: No!

00:02:40.948 --> 00:02:43.038
MATT: No! No!

00:02:43.038 --> 00:02:44.378
TRAVIS: You cannot!

00:02:44.378 --> 00:02:46.330
You may not do that!

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.163
SAM: Shake it, shake it.

00:02:47.163 --> 00:02:49.346
ALL: No!

00:02:49.346 --> 00:02:51.362
TRAVIS: No!
SAM: Shake it, shake it up.

00:02:51.362 --> 00:02:52.429
Shake it nice.
TRAVIS: Stop it!

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:54.612
SAM: You got to get the yogurt around.
LAURA: It's exploding!

00:02:54.612 --> 00:02:56.520
LIAM: Get behind me Satan, stop!

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.197
SAM: And here's your drink.
ASHLEY: Get that outta here.

00:02:58.197 --> 00:02:59.940
SAM: You don't seem interested in it?

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.560
No problem. I'll drink it for ya.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.243
ALL: No.

00:03:03.243 --> 00:03:04.779
TRAVIS: Don't do it. Don't do it!

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:06.050
ALL: No!

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.390
LAURA: Sam, stop it! Stop drinking now!

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.319
SAM: That is real absinthe, guys.

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.200
(laughter)

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.808
You said that it was fake!

00:03:14.808 --> 00:03:16.891
(laughter)

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:20.818
That is real!

00:03:20.818 --> 00:03:21.897
(laughter)

00:03:21.897 --> 00:03:23.548
TRAVIS: The crew is ready!

00:03:23.548 --> 00:03:25.131
(laughter)

00:03:25.131 --> 00:03:26.181
SAM: Oh boy!

00:03:26.181 --> 00:03:28.382
(laughter)

00:03:28.382 --> 00:03:30.101
I'm drinking absinthe and coffee!

00:03:30.101 --> 00:03:32.242
(laughter)

00:03:32.242 --> 00:03:35.337
And yogurt!
(laughter)

00:03:35.337 --> 00:03:36.774
Oh boy!
TALIESIN: Yogurt.

00:03:36.774 --> 00:03:37.990
LAURA: Do not drink any more.
LIAM: Oh, stop.

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.114
SAM: I got to commit to the bit!

00:03:39.114 --> 00:03:41.812
LAURA: No, you don't.
TRAVIS: No, no, no.

00:03:41.812 --> 00:03:43.910
ASHLEY: I'm a little curious about it.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.537
SAM: It actually kind of tastes okay.

00:03:45.537 --> 00:03:47.895
TRAVIS: No, that's just the shock.

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.180
SAM: Anyway!

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.000
Head on over to the campaign now

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.550
and check everything out at twistedtaverns.com.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:59.383
Oh!

00:03:59.383 --> 00:04:02.120
(laughter)

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.360
And thanks for supporting the show.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.193
Matt, back to you.

00:04:06.193 --> 00:04:08.660
MARISHA: You can actively see it hitting his bloodstream.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.784
MATT: Yeah. It's like a hot pepper afterburn.

00:04:10.784 --> 00:04:13.120
SAM: It's real, guys!

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.723
MARISHA: Yeah, we did a cocktail tutorial show.
SAM: I know, but I thought they were going to put in

00:04:16.723 --> 00:04:18.697
colored water or something!

00:04:18.697 --> 00:04:20.029
MARISHA: Do we have time for that?

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:21.665
(laughter)

00:04:21.665 --> 00:04:23.698
LIAM: I remember when we thought that

00:04:23.698 --> 00:04:27.047
whipped cream in red wine was the absolute worst.

00:04:27.047 --> 00:04:28.509
TRAVIS: Glug, glug, glug, glug!
SAM: Yogurt and absinthe

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:30.072
might be worse!

00:04:30.072 --> 00:04:31.170
MATT: Oh wow!

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.962
TALIESIN: There are so many
conflicting ingredients happening.

00:04:33.962 --> 00:04:35.182
TRAVIS: All over the table.

00:04:35.182 --> 00:04:36.260
(laughter)

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.150
SAM: I got to play with this smell tonight.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.340
MATT: It's like when you used to make suicides

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.500
by going to all different sodas at the soda thing.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.040
But if you really hate yourself.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.450
TRAVIS: Long live.
TALIESIN: The lemon and the yogurt

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.975
are just going to curdle
before it hits your fucking stomach.

00:04:48.975 --> 00:04:50.809
SAM: Mixes with the brown ale.

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:52.800
MATT: Oh god!

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.110
Well, thank you, Sam?
SAM: Sure.

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.670
MATT: And thank you Twisted Taverns.

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.870
And give a shout out to our friends at D&amp;D Beyond,

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.490
the official tool set of our show.

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.910
D&amp;D Beyond just added another digital tool.

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.420
So now you can share your dice results

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.100
with everyone in your campaign as it's happening,

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.100
so everyone can be connected in the app.

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:15.020
Still recovering from that.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.250
While you're playing together, which is awesome.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.850
Head on over to D&amp;D Beyond to check it out yourself.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.611
You all right, Sam?
SAM: Yeah.

00:05:23.611 --> 00:05:27.607
(laughter)

00:05:27.607 --> 00:05:30.387
TRAVIS: Do we have an EpiPen in the wings?

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.070
I know we have a defibrillator.

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.140
I'm just making sure we got our bases covered. (laughs)

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.070
LIAM: On top of it all, you look like you're starring

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.308
in a gritty "Sonic the Hedgehog" reboot.

00:05:40.308 --> 00:05:43.271
(laughter)

00:05:43.271 --> 00:05:46.062
TRAVIS: You look like Doctor Eggman and Sonic! (laughs)

00:05:46.062 --> 00:05:47.812
MATT: Look out, Ben Schwartz, he's coming for you!

00:05:47.812 --> 00:05:50.062
(laughter)

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.350
Well, thank you all for joining us live

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:55.952

Thankfully, that's the end of it all.

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:10.663
We get to close out or announcements now.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:13.993
So without further ado,

00:06:13.993 --> 00:06:18.490

(flames whooshing)

00:07:53.776 --> 00:07:56.309
(dragon roaring)

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:58.790
MATT: And welcome back.

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:03.898
We're still recovering from Sam's shenanigans.

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:09.700
Last we left off: The Mighty Nein,

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.650
upon traversing a majority of their journey

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:15.700
across Eiselcross to reach the ruins of Aeor

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:18.190
on the cusp of their final day of travel

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:20.920
alongside the Tomb Takers and Lucien,

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.950
the original pilot, it seems, of Mollymauk's body

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:26.533
before you met him.

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:31.050
You encountered a final challenge in the wilderness

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:35.610
as the ancient white dragon Gelidon, the Nightmare in Ivory,

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:37.630
had come across your scent, and

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:39.270
swooped down for vengeance,

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:43.210
recognizing those who had not too long before

00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:47.003
encroached upon her lair and stole from her hoard.

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:51.350
After a battle in which Gelidon was unexpecting

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:53.830
the sheer veracity of the response

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:57.830
and the volume of trained and experienced individuals

00:08:57.830 --> 00:08:59.260
that were counter assaulting,

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:03.030
fled within an inch of her life.

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:05.200
And you were all left successful

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.723
in fighting off this dangerous entity.

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:10.483
Continuing your trek into the night.

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:13.333
As the sunlight vanished,

00:09:13.333 --> 00:09:16.230
and you found yourselves on one final evening of rest,

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:18.360
you made your way into Caleb's tower,

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.450
and upon plotting out what you were to do

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:22.100
in the days to come,

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.140
realized that the Bag of Holding

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:25.210
that Fjord had been carrying

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:27.410
was no longer on his person,

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:29.010
realizing it had been taken by Otis

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:31.870
in the middle of the fray with this white dragon.

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:32.960
In searching for the whereabouts

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.330
they had already left the tower

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.880
and had made their way into the dark snowy evening.

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:40.860
You all gave chase and managed to catch up to them

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:44.760
a little ways past where you had set up for the evening,

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.460
and a battle took place that very quickly turned

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:48.723
in their favor.

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:52.260
Scrambling to gain some ground

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.780
and eventually just escape with your lives,

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.183
you manage to begin to outrun them.

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:00.670
Not with the Bag of Holding you lost,

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:02.800
but at least one of the two threshold crests

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.200
that had been recovered,

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.550
that, as far as you knew, they required

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:09.300
to complete whatever it was they were attempting to do

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.470
in the ruins of Aeor.

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:15.730
So as we return, you are all charging away

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:16.890
freshly from the fray,

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:21.180
just barely ahead of those that chase you.

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.960
You can still see flashes of light behind you

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:26.070
as various bits of arcane flashes

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:27.730
start making their way in your direction,

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:31.260
too wide in the shadow to make purchase on your bodies

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:32.890
with the short time in which those of you

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:35.710
who are magically enhanced with your travel speeds

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:39.550
to continue in a somewhat northeastern direction,

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:41.020
northward direction.

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:42.377
What do you do?

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:46.940
SAM: Who's an animal right now?

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:48.782
LAURA: I am. I'm carrying Caduceus.

00:10:48.782 --> 00:10:49.830
SAM: What kind of animal?

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:52.620
LAURA: I'm a giant owl.

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:54.562
SAM: Okay.
MARISHA: I'm a man-mmoth.

00:10:54.562 --> 00:10:55.771
LAURA: A man-mmoth?
MARISHA: A man-mmoth.

00:10:55.771 --> 00:10:56.604
SAM: You're a man-mmoth?

00:10:56.604 --> 00:10:58.862
MARISHA: I'm a man-mmoth, and I've got Fjord.

00:10:58.862 --> 00:11:00.950
I'm nervous.

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:01.783
SAM: And I'm on foot.

00:11:01.783 --> 00:11:02.880
Yasha, are you on foot?

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:03.870
LIAM: I can't remember.

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:05.440
ASHLEY: I am--

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.956
No. I am a--

00:11:06.956 --> 00:11:08.097
SAM: No!

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:09.910
ASHLEY: Standby.

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:10.850
LAURA: Are you something?

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:12.250
ASHLEY: I feel like I'm something.

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:14.323
SAM: And what about you, Cay?

00:11:14.323 --> 00:11:16.496
LIAM: I can't remember where Caleb was placed.

00:11:16.496 --> 00:11:18.293
SAM: ♪ (imitates horn) ♪

00:11:18.293 --> 00:11:20.980
TRAVIS: If we want, I can do the Marine Layer thing

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:25.070
and give us a big cloud of fog.

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:27.580
It's in the middle of the night.
SAM: Does it follow you or does it--?

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:28.527
TRAVIS: It does. Yeah.

00:11:28.527 --> 00:11:31.030
LAURA: Well, wouldn't they be able to follow the fog, then?

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:32.690
TRAVIS: I mean, it's pitch dark outside,

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:36.267
so at least it might hide us if they are going overhead.

00:11:36.267 --> 00:11:37.100
SAM: Sure. Sure.

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:37.933
Yeah, let's do it.
LAURA: Oh, that's true.

00:11:37.933 --> 00:11:40.350
TRAVIS: If they start flying or running, but again,

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:42.400
anyone within five feet can see perfectly.

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:44.945
Anyone outside of five feet can't see shit.

00:11:44.945 --> 00:11:45.930
LAURA: Oh, then no. Don't do it.

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:47.360
TRAVIS: We'd have to hold hands or whatever.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.770
LAURA: We'd be flying blind.

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:51.778
LIAM: They see everything.

00:11:51.778 --> 00:11:52.980
TRAVIS: Oh, right.

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:55.450
LIAM: Everything.
TRAVIS: Magic eyes. Right.

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:56.930
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Bless

00:11:56.930 --> 00:12:01.105
on anybody who's making speed right now who's near me.

00:12:01.105 --> 00:12:02.480
So who would that?

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.295
That would be one, two.

00:12:04.295 --> 00:12:05.510
MATT: Well, you have a mammoth.

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:06.740
TALIESIN: Have a mammoth.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:08.350
MATT: You have an eagle.

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:09.850
TALIESIN: An owl.
MATT: Or an owl, sorry.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.549
TALIESIN: I feel like there was an eagle.

00:12:12.549 --> 00:12:14.873
LAURA: I don't know what Caleb was.

00:12:14.873 --> 00:12:15.810
LIAM: I wouldn't have been able

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:18.770
to turn Beauregard into a mammoth if I was an eagle.

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:20.070
MATT: Yeah, no, you, you had lost your form

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:21.620
at the beginning of the combat.

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:25.180
LAURA: So Beau, all of us are on people, right?

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:27.823
LIAM: We're all in a clump fleeing.

00:12:27.823 --> 00:12:30.326
ASHLEY: I bamfed out my wings and I grabbed Caleb.

00:12:30.326 --> 00:12:31.670
LAURA: That's what it is. You're flying.

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:32.503
LIAM: That's what it was
ASHLEY: Yes.

00:12:32.503 --> 00:12:33.886
SAM: But how long does that--

00:12:33.886 --> 00:12:35.620
(as Veth) How long does that last?

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:36.920
LAURA: Like a minute.
ASHLEY: A minute!

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.120
MATT: One minute.
SAM: Okay.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.810
LAURA: Oh shit.
MATT: (laughs)

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:42.270
LIAM: Do we want to all take to the air?

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:43.913
TALIESIN: Run. Run!
SAM: Yes!

00:12:43.913 --> 00:12:44.755
Can we do that?

00:12:44.755 --> 00:12:45.588
LAURA: Can we do that?

00:12:45.588 --> 00:12:47.450
MATT: You can hear shouting not far from you,

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:49.240
echoing across and cutting through

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.800
the sound of wind and snow,

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.370
blasting into your face as you go.

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:54.377
You hear the familiar voice go,

00:12:54.377 --> 00:12:56.023
(as Lucien) "Run all you like!

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:59.140
"We'll be right behind ya."

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:01.111
LIAM: Drop me.
TRAVIS: Gotta go. Gotta go.

00:13:01.111 --> 00:13:02.138
ASHLEY: What?
LIAM: Drop me.

00:13:02.138 --> 00:13:03.290
ASHLEY: What do you mean?

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:04.910
LIAM: Do it!

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:05.800
ASHLEY: Fuck!

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.880
LIAM: And I will turn into a giant eagle,

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.620
which means that Beauregard will turn back into Beauregard

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:13.773
with Fjord sitting on her, and I will grab them both.

00:13:13.773 --> 00:13:15.280
MATT: They both (thud) into the snow

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.330
and right as you collapse and slide,

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:19.160
two claws should wrap around

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.140
and lift you out of the snow,

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:22.425
your faces filled with ice and sleet.

00:13:22.425 --> 00:13:24.623
TRAVIS: (muffled cry)

00:13:24.623 --> 00:13:25.764
(flapping sounds)

00:13:25.764 --> 00:13:26.890
So now you've picked them both up,

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:28.716
so you're handling both of them.

00:13:28.716 --> 00:13:31.530
You're still flying for the next short period of time.

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:33.130
You are carrying in one claw--?

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:34.110
LAURA: I'm carrying Caduceus.

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:35.443
MATT: The stone and Caduceus in the other,

00:13:35.443 --> 00:13:36.790
and you're just running.

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:37.623
SAM: Yep.

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:42.770
TALIESIN: We may have to ditch the fucking stone.

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:44.180
SAM: No.

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:45.707
LAURA: No, we're not going to ditch the stone!

00:13:45.707 --> 00:13:47.030
They're going to find the stone!

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:48.917
TALIESIN: We got to deal with these two.

00:13:48.917 --> 00:13:50.850
LAURA: I'm an eagle.
SAM: I'm fast, I'm fast! I can run!

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:52.808
LAURA: Can I fly forward

00:13:52.808 --> 00:13:56.430
and give the stone to Fjord?

00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:57.510
Who's carrying Fjord?

00:13:57.510 --> 00:13:58.870
How heavy is the stone?

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:00.150
MATT: Currently Fjord and Beauregard

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:02.930
are being held by Caleb's eagle form.

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:04.140
The stone's pretty heavy.

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:08.880
In its solid form it weighs about 80 to 100 pounds.

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:10.640
TRAVIS: Oh shit!
LAURA: Oh, it's like another person.

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.170
MATT: Yeah.

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:14.880
LAURA: Well yeah, but Yasha is about to stop flying.

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.913
So she'll be on foot just like you.

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:19.900
SAM: Yep.

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:21.660
Maybe you should drop Beau.

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:23.960
Drop Beau and take the stone!

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.163
Beau's super fast.

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:27.270
MARISHA: I am super fast.

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:29.550
LAURA: I don't know how long I have
left on my Polymorph either.

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:33.210
'Cause I was an owl before the fight.

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:34.043
MATT: Correct, you guys have traveled

00:14:34.043 --> 00:14:35.110
for a little over a half an hour,

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:36.638
so you have maybe 20 more minutes.

00:14:36.638 --> 00:14:37.740
TRAVIS: How's your constitution?

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:39.773
It's cold as fuck out here, by the way.

00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:44.049
MARISHA: You know, it's average.

00:14:44.049 --> 00:14:46.166
It's fair.
SAM: I thought you were immune to the cold.

00:14:46.166 --> 00:14:47.520
MARISHA: I'm not.

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.660
I've got low hit points, but I can run real fast.

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:51.290
TRAVIS: That's important to remember.

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:55.614
Low hit points is no good. We can't drop you.

00:14:55.614 --> 00:14:57.650
MATT: So we have an eagle and an owl

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:01.583
clutching three members of the group,

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:06.750
and currently you and Veth, Yasha,

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:09.040
who are unaccounted for in the flight pattern.

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:10.300
And you're fairly small and light,

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:11.948
but you're just dashing--

00:15:11.948 --> 00:15:13.128
♪ Dashing through the snow ♪

00:15:13.128 --> 00:15:15.090
LAURA: (laughs)

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:17.290
MATT: -- at a pretty decent pace.

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:18.123
Kind of hard to see.

00:15:18.123 --> 00:15:18.990
From your guys' perspective

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:19.950
it's almost just like Bugs Bunny

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:21.243
just curling through the snow.

00:15:21.243 --> 00:15:23.385
It's just this little (whirring).

00:15:23.385 --> 00:15:24.970
SAM: I mean, I can run and I can hide,

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:28.821
but you're slow and big.
ASHLEY: I can get pretty far.

00:15:28.821 --> 00:15:30.563
SAM: Yeah? Okay, fly. Go!

00:15:30.563 --> 00:15:32.770
MATT: And you are giving off light, just to mention.

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:33.900
As part of these wings,

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.430
out from you there is this faint glow around you,

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:38.480
and so you are this beacon

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.170
that is flying through the sky.

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:41.003
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:46.683
One minute. Okay.

00:15:46.683 --> 00:15:50.250
So I'm going to get a little closer to the ground.

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:51.083
MATT: Okay.

00:15:51.083 --> 00:15:53.380
ASHLEY: And bring them back in

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:54.672
and just start booking it.

00:15:54.672 --> 00:15:56.230
MATT: Okay. You got it.

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:57.860
So you have a pretty good run speed.

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:02.842
ASHLEY: Yeah. I'm 50 feet walking speed.

00:16:02.842 --> 00:16:04.110
SAM: Oh shit!
MATT: So if you're dashing,

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:06.493
you can go a 100 a round.
SAM: That's faster than me!

00:16:06.493 --> 00:16:07.326
ASHLEY: Oh, really?

00:16:07.326 --> 00:16:09.460
SAM: I'm 90 per round, if I need to.

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:10.960
MATT: With your bonus action dash.

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.980
LAURA: They can pretty much keep up.

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:15.790
MATT: Yeah, you guys can keep up with--

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:17.340
Well, what's your flying speed?

00:16:18.523 --> 00:16:20.000
TRAVIS: 60?
LIAM: No, that's the eagle.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.690
LAURA: Yeah, I'm 60 as an owl as well.

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:24.070
MATT: Yeah, so they can't quite keep up.

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:25.340
They're falling a little behind,

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:27.860
but if you're keeping on this path,

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:30.023
you could hope that it's enough.

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:32.450
What are you doing?

00:16:33.528 --> 00:16:34.900
SAM: Yeah?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:35.760
Anybody else glowing?

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:36.593
Anything else glowing?

00:16:36.593 --> 00:16:38.050
My sword is gone.

00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:39.400
Your wings are going to disappear.

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.000
Anybody else have shit that glows?

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.110
TALIESIN: We're leaving a trail in the snow.

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:45.038
TRAVIS: Right.
SAM: Can you carry me?

00:16:45.038 --> 00:16:46.420
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:47.560
SAM: Can she carry me?

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.060
MATT: Yeah. I'll allow it.

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:50.060
SAM: I'm jumping on!

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:51.100
ASHLEY: Come on.

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:53.677
SAM: This is not how I thought our date would go.

00:16:53.677 --> 00:16:56.260
(laughter)

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:57.150
ASHLEY: Works for me.

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:58.590
This'll be more than enough date.

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:00.330
TALIESIN: I'm casting--

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:02.310
How close are we right now?

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:03.450
MATT: You guys are clustered together,

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:05.830
though of the speed of which you all flying

00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:07.375
and you're just dangling currently

00:17:07.375 --> 00:17:09.947
from Jester's grasp.
LAURA: Are you an eagle?

00:17:09.947 --> 00:17:11.172
MATT: You could see that Yasha,

00:17:11.172 --> 00:17:14.070
holding Veth on her shoulders,

00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:16.200
is starting to slightly fall behind,

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.100
just ever inchingly.
TALIESIN: We losing them.

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:22.300
I'm going to cast Bless then really quickly on--

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.750
And who else is--?

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:27.450
We have two,

00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:29.243
you two are birds right now?

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:31.930
You and Liam?

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:36.810
You two and yeah, and Yasha.

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:38.203
TRAVIS: Who's on foot?

00:17:38.203 --> 00:17:40.750
LAURA: Yasha and Veth.
TRAVIS: Right behind Yasha,

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:44.790
right as we pass, I'll cast at 1st-level Create Water,

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:45.940
which is a 30-foot cube

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:49.270
that'll just start snowing above where she's running through

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:52.233
and drop fresh snow, fresh pow.

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:55.960
MATT: You see as it begins to slowly, softly hit the ground

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.610
and then cover the path

00:17:57.610 --> 00:17:58.930
and the tracks that are being left behind

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:01.408
for that one point in space.

00:18:01.408 --> 00:18:03.496
While that's happening,

00:18:03.496 --> 00:18:06.970
you see these three arcs of crackling eldritch energy

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:09.580
flashing out from the darkness in the distance.

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:11.623
The first one misses.

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:18.045
Second one would be 16 against you, Jester.

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:20.910
LAURA: I mean, is that against my AC?

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:23.010
MATT: It's against the AC of the owl form.

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:24.538
LAURA: The owl.

00:18:24.538 --> 00:18:26.357
17!

00:18:26.357 --> 00:18:27.710
MATT: All righty.

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:29.503
You just dart out of the way.

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:33.440
LAURA: Whoa, owls are way harder to hit than eagles, though!

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.100
Good to know!

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:36.297
TRAVIS: Damn.

00:18:36.297 --> 00:18:39.085
MATT: And that is a 20 to hit.

00:18:39.085 --> 00:18:40.145
LAURA: Me still?
MATT: Yes.

00:18:40.145 --> 00:18:42.178
LIAM: (laughs)

00:18:43.042 --> 00:18:44.365
TRAVIS: Are you glowing?
LAURA: That hits me, then.

00:18:44.365 --> 00:18:45.540
MATT: Okay.

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:48.510
You take four points of force damage

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:51.620
and this strange force tugs you back,

00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:53.510
almost like you had a hook pulled around you

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:54.960
and pulls you back 10 feet.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:56.310
You rear up for a second,

00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:57.650
like the wind shoves against you,

00:18:57.650 --> 00:18:59.630
and you continue to push forward.

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:01.090
A minor setback.

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:03.350
LAURA: So now I'm basically even with Yasha?

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:05.160
MATT: At the moment, yes.
LAURA: Okay.

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.118
LIAM: What is all the terrain around us right now

00:19:07.118 --> 00:19:08.320
that we're escaping through?

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.210
MATT: It is open snow.
LIAM: Flat?

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:15.210
MATT: You have a visual range of only maybe 30 to 60 feet

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:18.420
before the snow and the gentle fog

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:19.770
just completely consumes.

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:22.940
And from what you can see around you, it is just flat snow.

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:25.030
TRAVIS: Hunter's moon or moonless night?

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:27.487
MATT: You see no light in the sky.

00:19:27.487 --> 00:19:29.760
You don't know what the placement of the moon would be,

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:33.730
but the snowstorm, or at least this cloud cover above

00:19:33.730 --> 00:19:36.125
has cut cutoff all possible glow from the sky.

00:19:36.125 --> 00:19:36.966
TRAVIS: Pretty dim.

00:19:36.966 --> 00:19:39.378
We just need distance.
TALIESIN: Are you with me?

00:19:39.378 --> 00:19:41.400
MARISHA: I'm being carried by Caleb.

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:42.233
TALIESIN: Okay, no.

00:19:43.259 --> 00:19:44.940
LAURA: Ugh.
MATT: You just keep pushing on?

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:48.110
SAM: Yeah, we've gone for only a few seconds, right?

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:49.560
LAURA: I mean, we've gone for like a minute

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.727
because Yasha dropped, right?

00:19:51.727 --> 00:19:54.180
MATT: Well, she dropped early, but I'm just gathering,

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:56.020
are you guys changing anything in preparation

00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:58.840
or are you just all pushing ahead?

00:19:58.840 --> 00:19:59.680
TRAVIS: Should we turn?

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:04.040
MARISHA: Yeah, especially if you snowed over, yeah.

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:05.650
LAURA: But I don't know where--

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:07.210
I figured we should head towards--

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:08.366
I can't talk.

00:20:08.366 --> 00:20:09.380
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:10.420
MATT: Yep.
SAM: You just go

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:11.493
and we'll follow.

00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:13.243
Probably.

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:16.054
TRAVIS: Yeah, if you start banking off in a direction,

00:20:16.054 --> 00:20:17.512
we'll follow.
LAURA: I'll bank,

00:20:17.512 --> 00:20:19.160
but I don't know which direction I'm going.

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:21.325
TRAVIS: Doesn't matter.
MATT: Pick one.

00:20:21.325 --> 00:20:22.857
LAURA: I'm going to bank right!

00:20:22.857 --> 00:20:24.020
SAM: Banking right?

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:25.820
MATT: Okay. So she begins to bank right.

00:20:28.011 --> 00:20:30.256
Yasha, roll a perception check for me.

00:20:30.256 --> 00:20:31.089
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:20:32.463 --> 00:20:34.120
SAM: Do I get to look as well or no?

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.390
MATT: Yeah, you would as well 'cause you're both glancing.

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:36.810
SAM: I'm terrible at perception.

00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:37.643
LIAM: The stress of last week

00:20:37.643 --> 00:20:38.476
has just shown up again.
SAM: 10.

00:20:38.476 --> 00:20:39.682
MATT: And this would be--
ASHLEY: 22.

00:20:39.682 --> 00:20:41.010
MATT: This would be with disadvantage

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:43.411
because there's the middle of the storm.

00:20:43.411 --> 00:20:45.227
ASHLEY: Disadvantage? So roll again?

00:20:45.227 --> 00:20:47.315
MATT: Yeah, you have darkvision, but there is--

00:20:47.315 --> 00:20:49.260
there's not heavy, but there's enough snowfall

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:53.320
and very little light that it's a challenging roll.

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:54.270
ASHLEY: 22.
SAM: Nice!

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:55.446
MATT: 22 again? All right.

00:20:55.446 --> 00:20:56.718
SAM: 10.
MATT: 10? Yeah.

00:20:56.718 --> 00:20:58.920
So while you are lost in the elements, Yasha,

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:00.480
you are keeping a bead on Jester

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:02.690
and as soon as you see the form of the owl above

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:03.900
you shift off to the right.

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:06.310
You just skid off and follow that path.

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:09.194
You, make a perception check for me as well.

00:21:09.194 --> 00:21:10.370
LIAM: Should be good.

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:11.203
SAM: As soon as she banked--

00:21:11.203 --> 00:21:13.077
MATT: You're closer without much of an issue, so.

00:21:13.077 --> 00:21:13.993
LAURA: Can I hoot?

00:21:15.203 --> 00:21:16.890
To catch his attention.

00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:17.751
MATT: If you want to.

00:21:17.751 --> 00:21:18.584
LAURA: (hooting)

00:21:18.584 --> 00:21:20.262
LIAM: 19.
SAM: Too loud!

00:21:20.262 --> 00:21:22.104
MATT: So all following Jester's path,

00:21:22.104 --> 00:21:23.417
you go ahead and scoot to the right

00:21:23.417 --> 00:21:25.586
and continue pushing in that direction.

00:21:25.586 --> 00:21:27.767
LAURA: I sc-hoot to the right. (laughs)

00:21:27.767 --> 00:21:31.410
SAM: As we turn right, I'm going to cast Silent Image

00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:35.320
60 feet to the left of where we made the turn

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:37.860
and I'm just going to make the image

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:42.168
of a halfling

00:21:42.168 --> 00:21:46.260
Veth-type person just hiding in the snow

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:47.950
and peeking up.

00:21:47.950 --> 00:21:50.740
And it'll last for 10 minutes at that spot.

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:51.573
MATT: Okay.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.550
Got it. Okay.

00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:55.383
You do that.

00:21:56.537 --> 00:21:57.626
ASHLEY: Give her a pat.

00:21:57.626 --> 00:21:59.996
Good idea, good idea, good idea.

00:21:59.996 --> 00:22:01.992
SAM: (imitating baby crying)

00:22:01.992 --> 00:22:04.575
(laughter)

00:22:05.465 --> 00:22:07.140
TRAVIS: How far away were you from where

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:09.240
that thing was conjured?

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:13.220
SAM: When we turned, it can go 60 feet out the other way.

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:14.540
MATT: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Do you want me to douse

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:16.040
you with Faerie Fire?

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.140
The fake you?

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:18.940
SAM: Oh, I mean, you do you.

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:21.110
I can't talk to you, right?

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:22.550
TRAVIS: Would kind of sell it.

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:23.383
I'll do it.

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:25.330
No, I won't.

00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:26.283
Because I'd have to get the sword out.

00:22:26.283 --> 00:22:28.020
SAM: Cool, cool, cool.

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:29.110
MATT: Okay.

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:30.720
So continuing on in that direction,

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:33.470
you push on for another minute or so.

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:34.650
At this distance and with the snow

00:22:34.650 --> 00:22:36.380
you have no idea whether or not

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:38.440
the Tomb Takers are on your trail or not.

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.620
You left one distraction in an illusion,

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:43.703
but you've pushed on for a little bit of time.

00:22:43.703 --> 00:22:45.650
Do you continue to push on in that direction?

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:49.693
SAM: Should we serpentine?
TRAVIS: Serpentine!

00:22:49.693 --> 00:22:51.650
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Bank, bank.

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:55.110
LAURA: The problem is-- how long have we been flying now?

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:57.990
MATT: Since you left the combat, about maybe two minutes.

00:22:57.990 --> 00:22:59.015
LAURA: Oh, that's it.

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:02.453
I can't talk!

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:07.202
MATT: These are the early moments of rapid decision making

00:23:07.202 --> 00:23:10.560
that'll reveal what the next long trek will be.

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.130
So that's why I'm asking if there's anything else,

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:14.930
or are you sound with your current trajectory and plan

00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:15.763
and just pushing on?

00:23:15.763 --> 00:23:17.223
LAURA: I think we keep going.

00:23:17.223 --> 00:23:18.970
SAM: As we're going, I will--

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:21.270
Who's human? Not you two.

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:22.550
Who's a person?

00:23:22.550 --> 00:23:25.150
Okay. I'll Message.

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:26.920
And you're up on a bird or something?

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:27.790
TRAVIS: I'm with Caleb.

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:28.970
MARISHA: Yeah, we're being carried by Caleb.

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:31.037
SAM: I'll message Fjord

00:23:31.037 --> 00:23:34.727
from atop my Yasha platform and say:

00:23:34.727 --> 00:23:36.827
Where are we going? Where we headed?

00:23:37.688 --> 00:23:39.660
TRAVIS: Just go as far as you can, straight ahead.

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:40.893
Distance is key.

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:44.183
Just keep going.

00:23:44.183 --> 00:23:45.620
SAM: Okay.

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:47.750
Just keep going as fast as you can.

00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:48.583
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.

00:23:48.583 --> 00:23:49.470
Eyes behind us. Anything?

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:50.660
You see anything back there?

00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:51.573
SAM: I'm looking!

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:54.390
MATT: Make a perception check with disadvantage.

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:55.720
SAM: Uh-huh.

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:56.865
Six.

00:23:58.040 --> 00:23:59.600
MATT: Looks clear.

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:00.810
Except from all the snow.

00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:01.880
SAM: We're easy.

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:04.400
TALIESIN: I'm going to see if I can see anybody on our tail.

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.270
MATT: Disadvantage as well.

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:06.103
TALIESIN: All right.

00:24:07.305 --> 00:24:08.323
I want to be useful.

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:15.700
27.

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:16.533
MATT: With disadvantage?

00:24:16.533 --> 00:24:18.234
TALIESIN: I've rolled a 17 and a 19.

00:24:18.234 --> 00:24:20.150
MATT: Woo!
TRAVIS: You bad motherfucker.

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.329
MATT: That's pretty slick.

00:24:23.329 --> 00:24:24.657
ASHLEY: Higher perception, though.

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:32.140
MATT: Even with that high roll, it's hard to make out much,

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:37.140
but you swear you see a glimmer of light,

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:42.103
like something flashing, maybe about 200 feet behind you.

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:44.723
TALIESIN: They're still on our tail.

00:24:44.723 --> 00:24:45.690
They're still on our tail.

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:47.640
TRAVIS: Something to know,

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:49.740
because we were moving from A2 to Aeor,

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:52.180
we crossed the lava river, we were going east

00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:54.910
because we turned north, right?

00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:55.960
When we were fleeing?

00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:58.460
MATT: Yeah, you guys went northward.

00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:01.570
TRAVIS: There is a mountain range somewhere ahead of us.

00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:02.560
MARISHA: Head for the mountains?
LIAM: I was about to say, I'm--

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:03.560
MATT: Well, you were heading northward

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:05.320
and now Jester's turned right,

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:07.400
which means you're now heading eastward.

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:09.250
TRAVIS: Northeast, right? Like 45.

00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:11.260
Or did we do a hard 90?

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:12.600
I mean, sorry, 45.

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:14.179
TALIESIN: Gentle.

00:25:14.179 --> 00:25:15.012
TRAVIS: 45.

00:25:15.997 --> 00:25:18.750
SAM: Did you do a hard turn or a--

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:20.786
LAURA: Like a this.
TRAVIS: Well, a bank is like 45.

00:25:20.786 --> 00:25:22.085
LAURA: Like a bank.

00:25:22.085 --> 00:25:23.319
I didn't go like this.

00:25:23.319 --> 00:25:25.055
I went like this.
MATT: Yeah, Jester,

00:25:25.055 --> 00:25:26.387
roll a survival check for me.

00:25:26.387 --> 00:25:28.167
LAURA: Cool.
SAM: Cool, cool, cool.

00:25:28.167 --> 00:25:29.000
LAURA: That works.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.527
MATT: With the wisdom of your owl.

00:25:30.527 --> 00:25:32.343
LIAM: And Caleb is looking for--

00:25:32.343 --> 00:25:35.017
eagle is looking for mountain ranges.
LAURA: Owls are so wise, you guys.

00:25:35.017 --> 00:25:36.477
SAM: They know how many licks it takes

00:25:36.477 --> 00:25:38.533
to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop.

00:25:38.533 --> 00:25:39.566
LAURA: (laughs)

00:25:39.566 --> 00:25:40.582
(squeakily) Four.

00:25:40.582 --> 00:25:42.548
MATT: All right, we'll find out where
you're going when we get there.

00:25:42.548 --> 00:25:43.493
TRAVIS: Cool, cool, cool, cool.

00:25:43.493 --> 00:25:44.837
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm just going.

00:25:44.837 --> 00:25:45.670
SAM: Eat rats.

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:48.231
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)

00:25:48.231 --> 00:25:49.325
LIAM: What's your carry situation?

00:25:49.325 --> 00:25:52.843
LAURA: Are we-- wait, are we exhausted still?

00:25:54.197 --> 00:25:55.247
MATT: Yes.
LIAM: Most, yeah.

00:25:59.487 --> 00:26:00.597
LAURA: Okay, it's not worse, then.

00:26:00.597 --> 00:26:02.097
MATT: All right, although, interesting point of order,

00:26:02.097 --> 00:26:04.297
you are not in your actual physical form.

00:26:04.297 --> 00:26:05.757
When you're Polymorphed, I would say

00:26:05.757 --> 00:26:07.526
you do not suffer the exhaustion element,

00:26:07.526 --> 00:26:09.467
but you are still bound to whatever the physical attributes

00:26:09.467 --> 00:26:10.300
are of that creature.

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:11.912
LAURA: Okay.
TALIESIN: Damn.

00:26:11.912 --> 00:26:13.901
LIAM: Jester Owl, who are you carrying again, you got--

00:26:13.901 --> 00:26:14.942
LAURA: I've got Caduceus.

00:26:14.942 --> 00:26:16.842
LIAM: And the bag?
LAURA: And the bag.

00:26:16.842 --> 00:26:18.367
LIAM: In a claw?

00:26:18.367 --> 00:26:19.917
LAURA: Yes, yeah the bag--

00:26:19.917 --> 00:26:21.766
MATT: It's leather wrapped with straps over it.

00:26:21.766 --> 00:26:24.393
LIAM: Okay, so Caduceus and a bag.

00:26:24.393 --> 00:26:26.737
LAURA: Yeah, although I think Caduceus was--

00:26:26.737 --> 00:26:28.403
TRAVIS: They're trying to shoot
for the bag, not Jester.

00:26:28.403 --> 00:26:29.670
TALIESIN: I was on your back.
LAURA: Yeah.

00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:31.537
TALIESIN: So I think you might have one empty claw.

00:26:33.467 --> 00:26:35.740
MARISHA: Should we hand off the bag just in case?

00:26:38.227 --> 00:26:39.995
Kind of keep trading it?

00:26:39.995 --> 00:26:41.487
I don't know.

00:26:41.487 --> 00:26:42.745
TALIESIN: We got to pick up the runners.

00:26:42.745 --> 00:26:44.312
TRAVIS: You know what we could do?

00:26:44.312 --> 00:26:45.997
Drop that bitch in the lava river.

00:26:45.997 --> 00:26:47.467
LAURA: Yeah, I want to. That would be great.

00:26:47.467 --> 00:26:49.233
LIAM: I wanted to smash it on the rocks.

00:26:49.233 --> 00:26:50.677
MARISHA: Let's do it.

00:26:50.677 --> 00:26:52.397
How far away are we from the lava?

00:26:52.397 --> 00:26:53.230
TRAVIS: A bit.

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:54.652
MATT: You're about three days travel.

00:26:54.652 --> 00:26:56.665
MARISHA: Oh.
SAM: (laughs)

00:26:56.665 --> 00:26:59.797
TRAVIS: That's what they're tracking.
That's what they want.

00:26:59.797 --> 00:27:01.147
LAURA: They also have our blood.

00:27:02.057 --> 00:27:04.747
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, that's a bitch, too.

00:27:04.747 --> 00:27:07.466
LIAM: But if we could find a-- I'm a bird.

00:27:07.466 --> 00:27:12.274
(laughter)

00:27:12.274 --> 00:27:13.808
I'm not-- I'm going to keep it to myself.

00:27:13.808 --> 00:27:14.641
LAURA: That's the worst.

00:27:14.641 --> 00:27:16.567
LIAM: I going to keep it to myself.

00:27:16.567 --> 00:27:18.755
TALIESIN: Could have had a text thread
any time in the last week.

00:27:18.755 --> 00:27:20.312
(laughter)

00:27:20.312 --> 00:27:22.104
MATT: You continue on--
LIAM: I'm looking for mountain range.

00:27:22.104 --> 00:27:23.757
MARISHA: I was about to say the same thing.

00:27:23.757 --> 00:27:26.299
Can I scan the horizon? Do I see any type of--

00:27:26.299 --> 00:27:28.032
MATT: Both of you make perception checks with disadvantage.

00:27:28.032 --> 00:27:29.327
MARISHA: Okay, disadvantage.
LIAM: I guess a straight roll

00:27:29.327 --> 00:27:32.517
for me because giant eagle is at advantage for keen sight.

00:27:32.517 --> 00:27:33.697
MATT: This isn't about--

00:27:33.697 --> 00:27:34.530
MARISHA: Wow.

00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:36.913
MATT: Oh yeah, keen sight gives advantage regardless.

00:27:36.913 --> 00:27:39.197
So yeah, I'll say standard roll.
LIAM: Standard roll.

00:27:39.197 --> 00:27:43.217
MARISHA: A natural 20 and a two for six total.

00:27:43.217 --> 00:27:44.777
MATT: Sorry.

00:27:44.777 --> 00:27:47.597
LIAM: 19.
MATT: 19, okay.

00:27:47.597 --> 00:27:49.113
Where you are now,

00:27:49.113 --> 00:27:52.197
you see no signs of any mountain range anywhere.

00:27:52.197 --> 00:27:54.217
It is just snowy fields.

00:27:54.217 --> 00:27:58.390
And once again, that visual range is definitely cut off

00:27:58.390 --> 00:28:00.137
about 60 to 100 feet out

00:28:00.137 --> 00:28:02.737
from any visibility because of the current snowfall.

00:28:04.317 --> 00:28:06.484
But you keep pushing on,

00:28:06.484 --> 00:28:08.497
move on for the next two to three minutes.

00:28:08.497 --> 00:28:09.627
TRAVIS: Probably should turn--

00:28:09.627 --> 00:28:10.507
MATT: Five minutes.

00:28:10.507 --> 00:28:12.537
TRAVIS: Especially if we're potentially going east.

00:28:12.537 --> 00:28:14.474
We're going the direction they want to go.

00:28:14.474 --> 00:28:16.598
LAURA: Well, call it out, because we're just going.

00:28:16.598 --> 00:28:18.017
MARISHA: Is there a way--
LIAM: I'm fastest, too,

00:28:18.017 --> 00:28:19.356
so just yank my feathers, man.

00:28:19.356 --> 00:28:21.997
MARISHA: I shout to Fjord, is there a way to intersect

00:28:21.997 --> 00:28:24.297
with the lava river up ahead?

00:28:24.297 --> 00:28:26.987
TRAVIS: No, we're essentially be needing to do an about-face

00:28:26.987 --> 00:28:29.158
at this point, almost.

00:28:29.158 --> 00:28:31.672
Yeah, I'll just pull Caleb's feathers and say,

00:28:31.672 --> 00:28:34.827
"We need to turn left, follow us!"

00:28:34.827 --> 00:28:37.670
SAM: Are we falling behind or are you guys waiting for us?

00:28:38.997 --> 00:28:41.322
MATT: You guys are a little bit behind.

00:28:41.322 --> 00:28:42.837
You see them just catch--

00:28:42.837 --> 00:28:46.989
LAURA: If I pick up Yasha holding Veth.

00:28:47.987 --> 00:28:49.469
SAM: It only counts as one person, right?

00:28:49.469 --> 00:28:53.551
LAURA: Well, how much is it going to slow me down?

00:28:53.551 --> 00:28:55.034
MATT: Only one way to find out.

00:28:55.034 --> 00:28:56.927
LAURA: I'm going to pick them up because I don't want them

00:28:56.927 --> 00:28:59.117
to keep making a path in the snow.

00:28:59.117 --> 00:29:02.237
MATT: Okay, so you go ahead and you pick up Yasha

00:29:02.237 --> 00:29:06.837
with Veth on her back, with Caduceus on your back

00:29:06.837 --> 00:29:09.437
and clutching this weighty stone.

00:29:09.437 --> 00:29:11.110
It is slowing you down,

00:29:13.037 --> 00:29:15.927
but you are not making trails in the snow.

00:29:15.927 --> 00:29:18.177
Choice is yours which is more important.

00:29:18.177 --> 00:29:20.057
TRAVIS: Two options are to make for the lava river,

00:29:20.057 --> 00:29:22.177
try and destroy the stone which is three days away

00:29:22.177 --> 00:29:23.647
and a little perilous.

00:29:23.647 --> 00:29:25.668
The other is drop the stone.

00:29:25.668 --> 00:29:27.037
They stop following us.

00:29:27.037 --> 00:29:29.938
We go ahead to Aeor and we set up an ambush.

00:29:32.007 --> 00:29:33.807
Okay, then we go for the lava river.

00:29:34.837 --> 00:29:36.267
SAM: Three days away?

00:29:36.267 --> 00:29:37.577
TRAVIS: It's a long way away.

00:29:38.447 --> 00:29:40.095
SAM: It seems like we should go to Aeor.
ASHLEY: There's got to be--

00:29:40.095 --> 00:29:42.487
TALIESIN: Aeor is--
ASHLEY: Yeah, I feel like (mumbles).

00:29:42.487 --> 00:29:45.765
TRAVIS: I mean, we wouldn't stop moving
and neither would they.

00:29:45.765 --> 00:29:49.597
SAM: But they may not continue to chase us after a day.

00:29:49.597 --> 00:29:51.350
TALIESIN: Are they still following?
TRAVIS: We are closer than the next

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:53.292
MATT: Make a perception check.
TRAVIS: -- site on the map.

00:29:53.292 --> 00:29:55.217
MARISHA: Yeah, they would have to cut across the map

00:29:55.217 --> 00:29:57.697
to A5 or whatever.

00:29:57.697 --> 00:29:58.530
TALIESIN: 17?

00:29:58.530 --> 00:29:59.513
MARISHA: I think he's right.
MATT: You can't tell.

00:29:59.513 --> 00:30:01.337
MARISHA: I think we drop this bitch.

00:30:01.337 --> 00:30:03.406
SAM: In the lava river.
LIAM: That's three days away.

00:30:03.406 --> 00:30:04.937
TALIESIN: Drop it now and we hope they don't find it.

00:30:04.937 --> 00:30:07.037
LAURA: Mm-mm.
MARISHA: But, it's either that

00:30:07.037 --> 00:30:09.112
or we try to ambush some bitches

00:30:09.112 --> 00:30:12.051
in, like, two days, or we take that time that's been

00:30:12.051 --> 00:30:14.750
granted to us by dropping this and planning.
TRAVIS: You can strategize as a player.

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:17.857
SAM: But-- (pigeon coos) how do we get to the lava?

00:30:17.857 --> 00:30:19.177
We have to sleep at some point.

00:30:19.177 --> 00:30:20.917
ASHLEY: What if I just try to destroy it?

00:30:20.917 --> 00:30:23.227
SAM: She could try-- she's super strong.

00:30:23.227 --> 00:30:25.012
She could destroy it.

00:30:25.012 --> 00:30:27.047
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:30:27.047 --> 00:30:28.347
ASHLEY: My bare hands.

00:30:28.347 --> 00:30:29.738
LIAM: Or Magician's Judge.

00:30:29.738 --> 00:30:31.407
MARISHA: Or we tele--
TRAVIS: What do you think? Call it out.

00:30:31.407 --> 00:30:33.649
MARISHA: Or we don't drop it--
LAURA: I don't think we should drop it.

00:30:33.649 --> 00:30:35.477
MARISHA: In the winter.
LAURA: They've got Locate Object.

00:30:35.477 --> 00:30:36.310
TRAVIS: Sure.

00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:38.743
TALIESIN: How much is it slowing us down?

00:30:38.743 --> 00:30:40.637
MATT: She's at half speed right now clutching everyone.

00:30:40.637 --> 00:30:42.537
TALIESIN: Oh shit, yeah you're at half speed.

00:30:42.537 --> 00:30:44.497
LAURA: Yeah, I'm real slow.

00:30:44.497 --> 00:30:46.639
MARISHA: Can anyone teleport this bitch away?

00:30:46.639 --> 00:30:47.789
LAURA: Can I--

00:30:47.789 --> 00:30:48.982
Can I toss it?
SAM: Jester?

00:30:48.982 --> 00:30:51.299
LAURA: Can I toss the--
MARISHA: No!

00:30:51.299 --> 00:30:53.240
LAURA: Can I toss-- no, that's dumb.

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:54.887
TRAVIS: What?

00:30:54.887 --> 00:30:57.007
TALIESIN: I'd say keep the bag.

00:30:57.007 --> 00:30:58.697
MARISHA: Try and hand it off, hand off the bag.

00:30:58.697 --> 00:31:00.565
TRAVIS: If you hold the bag, they'll catch us,

00:31:00.565 --> 00:31:01.727
and then we're also in jeopardy.

00:31:01.727 --> 00:31:03.596
If you drop the bag they stop chasing us,

00:31:03.596 --> 00:31:05.275
we gain distance, we heal up,

00:31:05.275 --> 00:31:06.814
there's another fight to be had.

00:31:06.814 --> 00:31:09.114
If we try and make the lava river, they'll catch us.

00:31:10.337 --> 00:31:12.927
LAURA: I absolutely refuse to drop the stone.

00:31:12.927 --> 00:31:14.319
TRAVIS: What if they catch us?

00:31:19.797 --> 00:31:21.789
SAM: They can't catch us, we're fast.

00:31:21.789 --> 00:31:24.936
TALIESIN: And Caleb's carrying Fjord and Beau.
TRAVIS: She's not.

00:31:24.936 --> 00:31:26.217
LAURA: Yeah, he's carrying the light ones.

00:31:26.217 --> 00:31:28.589
I'm carrying all the heavy things right now.

00:31:28.589 --> 00:31:30.075
And he's got a faster distance.

00:31:30.075 --> 00:31:31.767
TALIESIN: Let's put Veth on Caleb.

00:31:31.767 --> 00:31:34.084
Let's do a little switch-a-roo.
LAURA: Let's put Yasha on Caleb.

00:31:34.084 --> 00:31:35.459
MARISHA: Yeah, let's redistribute weight.

00:31:35.459 --> 00:31:37.420
Let's redistribute weight real quick.

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:38.977
SAM: So you're going to fly up next to each other

00:31:38.977 --> 00:31:40.102
and do a pass off?
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:31:40.102 --> 00:31:41.586
TRAVIS: Do you want to land for a second?
SAM: Okay.

00:31:41.586 --> 00:31:44.469
LAURA: I'm going to-- (hooting)

00:31:44.469 --> 00:31:46.980
LIAM: (eagle screech)
and try to-- Yasha, try to--

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:49.477
I'm going to try to get above Caleb
and drop Yasha on Caleb's back.

00:31:49.477 --> 00:31:53.447
MATT: This is some mid-air refueling mechanism here.

00:31:53.447 --> 00:31:55.517
This is kind of awesome, okay, okay.

00:31:55.517 --> 00:31:56.894
MARISHA: So, and then you have the stone?

00:31:56.894 --> 00:31:57.727
LAURA: I have the stone.

00:31:57.727 --> 00:32:00.067
MARISHA: Then why don't I try, while you do that,

00:32:00.067 --> 00:32:03.877
and I can jump to you, because you'll get weighed down

00:32:03.877 --> 00:32:05.058
if you have the stone, will you?

00:32:05.058 --> 00:32:06.724
LAURA: That's true, yeah. Let's switch off--

00:32:06.724 --> 00:32:09.267
MARISHA: Yasha-- let's trade Yasha and Beau.

00:32:09.267 --> 00:32:12.565
TRAVIS: Can somebody shrink the stone? Is that a spell?

00:32:12.565 --> 00:32:13.781
SAM: Maybe.
TRAVIS: Miniaturizing something?

00:32:13.781 --> 00:32:15.647
LAURA: We have spells, but we're both animals.

00:32:15.647 --> 00:32:16.480
TRAVIS: You're animals.

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:18.027
MATT: Yeah, it's a problem.

00:32:18.917 --> 00:32:20.057
SAM: Yeah, let's do the switch-a-roo.

00:32:20.057 --> 00:32:21.188
ASHLEY: You're being held by Caleb.

00:32:21.188 --> 00:32:22.412
MARISHA: Yeah, we're going to tradesies.

00:32:22.412 --> 00:32:25.147
ASHLEY: So you would go over,
and then Veth and I would go over to

00:32:26.207 --> 00:32:28.024
Owl Caleb.
LAURA: No, I keep Veth.

00:32:28.024 --> 00:32:30.274
I keep Veth, I keep the stone.
TRAVIS: We're going to try this

00:32:30.274 --> 00:32:32.974
and we're going to end up dropping
the fucking thing anyway.

00:32:32.974 --> 00:32:34.480
SAM: I've got Feather Fall.

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:38.030
MARISHA: So do I, kind of.
LAURA: I keep Veth.

00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:38.863
SAM: We'll be okay.

00:32:38.863 --> 00:32:40.787
LAURA: Honestly, I think I keep Veth and the stone,

00:32:40.787 --> 00:32:42.327
and you just go over to Caleb.

00:32:42.327 --> 00:32:43.675
You stay with Caleb, too,

00:32:43.675 --> 00:32:45.788
because Caleb has a faster flying speed,

00:32:45.788 --> 00:32:47.801
so if he gets halved he's still going faster

00:32:47.801 --> 00:32:49.892
than I am halved.
SAM: Who else is on you? Fjord?

00:32:49.892 --> 00:32:51.375
MARISHA: Yeah.
LAURA: No, I've got Caduceus.

00:32:51.375 --> 00:32:54.041
MARISHA: Caleb has Fjord.
SAM: Okay, so you can hold the stone, right?

00:32:54.041 --> 00:32:55.737
TALIESIN: It's a 100 pound stone.

00:32:55.737 --> 00:32:57.045
SAM: Yeah, but you're a big cow man.

00:32:57.045 --> 00:33:00.567
TALIESIN: Yeah, but weirdly--
well, actually hold on, hold on.

00:33:00.567 --> 00:33:01.624
There's a thing.

00:33:01.624 --> 00:33:03.054
SAM: I can't hold it, it weighs more than me.

00:33:03.054 --> 00:33:06.784
LAURA: I've got a claw. I'm holding the stone in a claw.
SAM: Sure, okay, okay, okay.

00:33:06.784 --> 00:33:09.647
TALIESIN: I technically count as
large for my carrying capacity

00:33:09.647 --> 00:33:10.567
and what I can--

00:33:10.567 --> 00:33:11.937
LAURA: Don't tell him you count as large.

00:33:11.937 --> 00:33:13.227
That's going to make me even slower.

00:33:13.227 --> 00:33:14.985
TALIESIN: No, it's my

00:33:14.985 --> 00:33:16.832
carrying capacity.
MATT: He's pretty thin, though.

00:33:16.832 --> 00:33:18.981
It's less about carrying capacity as in

00:33:18.981 --> 00:33:20.402
holding it on your back.

00:33:20.402 --> 00:33:22.469
This would be you carrying it on your person,

00:33:22.469 --> 00:33:24.310
because you're holding it with
your arms while you're being--

00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:25.477
TALIESIN: Holding-- yeah, it's not doable.

00:33:25.477 --> 00:33:26.937
Yeah, nevermind.
MATT: Yeah.

00:33:26.937 --> 00:33:28.542
So you could try it.

00:33:30.057 --> 00:33:31.123
LAURA: Jump, Yasha.

00:33:31.123 --> 00:33:32.235
MARISHA: Let's see what happens.
LAURA: Actually,

00:33:32.235 --> 00:33:33.127
you don't even have to jump.

00:33:33.127 --> 00:33:35.057
I've got Yasha in a claw.
MATT: Yep.

00:33:35.057 --> 00:33:36.250
LAURA: Hold onto my leg.

00:33:37.288 --> 00:33:39.383
SAM: I can't understand your hooting.

00:33:39.383 --> 00:33:40.900
(laughter)

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:43.974
TRAVIS: A point of clarification, how high are you flying?

00:33:43.974 --> 00:33:45.237
How high is this?

00:33:45.237 --> 00:33:46.920
SAM: A thousand feet.
TRAVIS: I know.

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:48.537
(laughter)

00:33:48.537 --> 00:33:50.919
Are we at 40, or are we at 60, or are we at 20?

00:33:50.919 --> 00:33:52.617
SAM: 40 feet up, right now.
SAM: Let's say a thousand.

00:33:52.617 --> 00:33:53.927
MATT: You're not going to want to go too high,

00:33:53.927 --> 00:33:55.949
because you start getting into the heavier winds

00:33:55.949 --> 00:33:58.079
and the clouds themselves.

00:33:58.079 --> 00:34:00.602
LAURA: We're below the clouds and the heavy winds.

00:34:00.602 --> 00:34:04.745
TRAVIS: I was just doing it for fall--

00:34:04.745 --> 00:34:05.665
ASHLEY: Caduceus!

00:34:05.665 --> 00:34:07.167
MATT: I mean, you could push up
into the clouds if you want to,

00:34:07.167 --> 00:34:08.667
it'd be harder for you to be seen,

00:34:08.667 --> 00:34:11.317
but it gets a lot colder in there, too.

00:34:11.317 --> 00:34:13.433
SAM: Do you need a shove?
ASHLEY: She keeps hooting at me.

00:34:13.433 --> 00:34:14.513
What are we doing?

00:34:14.513 --> 00:34:15.621
SAM: That's because we're switching places.

00:34:15.621 --> 00:34:17.977
LAURA: I'm just going to get above Caleb and

00:34:17.977 --> 00:34:21.740
try to drop Yasha onto Caleb, as gently as possible.

00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:23.090
Fly, fly, set.

00:34:23.997 --> 00:34:25.210
SAM: Good luck, Yasha!

00:34:25.210 --> 00:34:27.685
MATT: All right, you are paratrooper

00:34:27.685 --> 00:34:30.045
dropped out--
TRAVIS: Terminal velocity.

00:34:30.045 --> 00:34:31.672
LAURA: No, subtler than that.

00:34:31.672 --> 00:34:32.657
I'm going to try to get closer.

00:34:32.657 --> 00:34:34.617
I don't want her to have to paratroop.

00:34:34.617 --> 00:34:35.917
MATT: No matter how close you--
TRAVIS: It happened.

00:34:35.917 --> 00:34:37.363
MATT: If you want to get real close,

00:34:37.363 --> 00:34:38.260
then we're going to have to make some rolls

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:39.931
to make sure you guys don't collide,

00:34:39.931 --> 00:34:41.722
so we're doing this from a safe distance.

00:34:41.722 --> 00:34:43.187
Jester pulls a little bit ahead,

00:34:43.187 --> 00:34:44.448
TALIESIN: Paratrooper baby.

00:34:44.448 --> 00:34:46.147
SAM: This is like Mission Impossible stuff.

00:34:46.147 --> 00:34:47.697
MATT: This is a combination of two things.

00:34:47.697 --> 00:34:50.372
(jumbled singing and flying noises)

00:34:50.372 --> 00:34:53.197
MATT: So Jester, in your owl form, you can roll

00:34:53.197 --> 00:34:57.157
either an intelligence check or a dexterity check.

00:34:57.157 --> 00:34:59.977
One of which being able to calculate the actual angle

00:34:59.977 --> 00:35:04.421
of dropping and the distance that she'll drop, as an owl,

00:35:04.421 --> 00:35:07.088
or just winging it, pardon the pun,

00:35:07.088 --> 00:35:08.867
and actually just hoping you're really good

00:35:08.867 --> 00:35:09.700
with your trajectory.

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:10.533
Your choice.

00:35:13.543 --> 00:35:14.924
TALIESIN: I'm going to drop the saves

00:35:14.924 --> 00:35:17.347
and I'm going to throw Guidance into you before we--

00:35:17.347 --> 00:35:19.541
LAURA: Okay, oh killer!

00:35:19.541 --> 00:35:21.248
I'm going to roll for dexterity.
TRAVIS: Bad choice of words.

00:35:21.248 --> 00:35:23.987
MATT: Okay, so roll, add the owl's dexterity modifier

00:35:23.987 --> 00:35:25.332
and then add a d4.
TRAVIS: "Killer!"

00:35:25.332 --> 00:35:28.040
(laughter)

00:35:29.961 --> 00:35:32.917
LIAM: No.
ASHLEY: She's looking at it for a long time.

00:35:32.917 --> 00:35:34.637
TALIESIN: You rolled a one, didn't you?

00:35:34.637 --> 00:35:35.824
TRAVIS: Did you really?

00:35:35.824 --> 00:35:37.242
Did you really?

00:35:37.242 --> 00:35:38.991
Did you?

00:35:38.991 --> 00:35:40.915
LIAM: That's just right.

00:35:40.915 --> 00:35:43.017
That's just right!

00:35:43.017 --> 00:35:46.442
MATT: So, the two eagles-- (whooshing)

00:35:46.442 --> 00:35:48.142
The snow is is pretty much--

00:35:48.142 --> 00:35:50.487
Like, everyone, your faces are absolutely numb.

00:35:50.487 --> 00:35:53.197
You can't even feel your nose or your ears right now

00:35:53.197 --> 00:35:54.954
from just the frost that's building up on you.

00:35:54.954 --> 00:35:56.524
LAURA: Sorry.
MATT: All areas of you hair

00:35:56.524 --> 00:35:58.997
are starting to freeze over at the edges.

00:35:58.997 --> 00:36:00.677
And Yasha, as you look down

00:36:00.677 --> 00:36:04.309
you can see being brought over Caleb as the eagle

00:36:04.309 --> 00:36:06.168
and you are dropped, and suddenly Caleb's eagle

00:36:06.168 --> 00:36:08.207
just goes (whooshing) out from under you,

00:36:08.207 --> 00:36:10.799
and you just plummet about 40 or so feet

00:36:10.799 --> 00:36:13.127
before (thudding) turning into-- you can see

00:36:13.127 --> 00:36:16.637
the gentle shape of Yasha's outline in the soft snow below

00:36:16.637 --> 00:36:19.807
as you all of a sudden just overshoot where she is.

00:36:19.807 --> 00:36:22.717
TRAVIS: Create Water spell on Yasha, hide her impact.

00:36:22.717 --> 00:36:24.347
LAURA: I stop, I stop, I stop.

00:36:24.347 --> 00:36:25.915
MARISHA: Just go, just go.

00:36:25.915 --> 00:36:28.336
SAM: And Feather Fa-- ah, nope.

00:36:28.336 --> 00:36:31.437
(laughter)

00:36:31.437 --> 00:36:34.805
LAURA: You could have done that before I--

00:36:34.805 --> 00:36:36.031
SAM: I got some snow in my eyes.
LIAM: That would've made her

00:36:36.031 --> 00:36:37.967
slowly, you would've been like (whooshing).

00:36:37.967 --> 00:36:39.377
MATT: So who's going back for Yasha?

00:36:39.377 --> 00:36:40.647
LAURA: I'm going back for Yasha.

00:36:40.647 --> 00:36:42.213
ASHLEY: Fresh pow, fresh pow.
MATT: Turn back around.

00:36:42.213 --> 00:36:43.921
LAURA: Actually, <i>you</i> go back for Yasha, pick her up.

00:36:43.921 --> 00:36:44.897
LIAM: Do I have passengers?

00:36:44.897 --> 00:36:47.020
I lost track of who was jumping where, what your plan--

00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:48.852
MATT: You are holding Beau and Fjord.

00:36:48.852 --> 00:36:50.052
LAURA: That's the whole fucking point.

00:36:50.052 --> 00:36:54.978
ASHLEY: I'm just sitting up, very
confused why she let go of me.

00:36:54.978 --> 00:36:55.811
Wha--?

00:36:56.669 --> 00:36:59.202
Okay, I'll just start booking it.

00:36:59.202 --> 00:37:00.512
MATT: All right you start booking it,

00:37:00.512 --> 00:37:02.577
and right as Jester comes around you swoop

00:37:02.577 --> 00:37:04.047
and grab Yasha once again.

00:37:04.047 --> 00:37:05.408
ASHLEY: What the fuck?!

00:37:05.408 --> 00:37:07.057
(laughter)

00:37:07.057 --> 00:37:08.806
SAM: Yasha, what happened?

00:37:08.806 --> 00:37:10.321
ASHLEY: I don't know!
TALIESIN: Are we being followed?

00:37:10.321 --> 00:37:13.100
SAM: She hooted and then she ditched you.
MATT: Make a perception check with disadvantage.

00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:14.698
LIAM: I love that you're scolding me into saving her

00:37:14.698 --> 00:37:15.687
while you're saving her.

00:37:15.687 --> 00:37:17.467
LAURA: I went and got her, but--
MATT: Hard to see.

00:37:17.467 --> 00:37:18.792
LAURA: -- you should've gotten her.

00:37:19.717 --> 00:37:20.864
MATT: So are you going to try this again or--

00:37:20.864 --> 00:37:22.637
SAM: Yes!
LAURA: Yeah, and I love that

00:37:22.637 --> 00:37:23.970
Caleb could've just picked her up, but instead--

00:37:23.970 --> 00:37:26.044
TRAVIS: Do you want to land to do this?

00:37:26.044 --> 00:37:29.524
We're on the ground already!
MATT: Yasha, Yasha.

00:37:29.524 --> 00:37:31.667
ASHLEY: No, we have to do it now.
LAURA: We have to keep going.

00:37:31.667 --> 00:37:33.125
MATT: You do take five points of bludgeoning damage

00:37:33.125 --> 00:37:35.377
from hitting some of the hard ground beneath the snow,

00:37:35.377 --> 00:37:36.677
which was thick, but not thick--
LAURA: This is going to be the one.

00:37:36.677 --> 00:37:39.180
TRAVIS: Did you pick her up and take off again?

00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:40.409
MARISHA: Doing this shit out of spite?

00:37:40.409 --> 00:37:42.493
LAURA: We're going slower obviously at this moment in time--

00:37:42.493 --> 00:37:45.267
TRAVIS: This is just arrogance.
LAURA: --so it's going to be easier to get her onto Caleb.

00:37:45.267 --> 00:37:47.609
MATT: So try it now again, if you want to.

00:37:47.609 --> 00:37:49.317
MARISHA: Come on, we're basically gods.

00:37:49.317 --> 00:37:50.996
SAM: This time I have Feather Fall ready.

00:37:50.996 --> 00:37:53.150
LAURA: I still have Guidance because I never used it.

00:37:55.257 --> 00:37:56.437
TALIESIN: Really, again?

00:37:56.437 --> 00:37:58.037
LAURA: It wasn't a one.

00:37:58.037 --> 00:37:58.870
Hold on.

00:38:02.037 --> 00:38:02.870
TRAVIS: That's a one.

00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:04.617
LAURA: Oh no, it's a two, thank you.

00:38:04.617 --> 00:38:07.248
Five plus two is seven.

00:38:07.248 --> 00:38:09.284
SAM: (groans)
ASHLEY: Even better.

00:38:09.284 --> 00:38:11.037
SAM: Feather Fall!

00:38:11.037 --> 00:38:12.495
MATT: Yasha is dropped.

00:38:12.495 --> 00:38:14.986
This time, Caleb, you under shoot

00:38:14.986 --> 00:38:18.659
and just watch her below, but you are falling gently.

00:38:18.659 --> 00:38:22.287
And very very gently, which Caleb if you want to,

00:38:22.287 --> 00:38:23.400
with the use of the Feather Fall,

00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:25.524
which does slow her decent significantly,

00:38:25.524 --> 00:38:27.117
that will give you enough time

00:38:27.117 --> 00:38:28.498
to try and scoop up under her.

00:38:28.498 --> 00:38:30.530
ASHLEY: I don't want to do this anymore!

00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:33.049
(laughter)

00:38:33.049 --> 00:38:35.858
Please somebody just carry me or I'll run!

00:38:35.858 --> 00:38:38.347
MATT: And right as you say that, the Caleb eagle

00:38:38.347 --> 00:38:40.577
picks you up, almost knocks the wind out of you.

00:38:40.577 --> 00:38:43.907
ASHLEY: Okay, well could've been a little bit more gentle,

00:38:43.907 --> 00:38:45.137
but that's fine.

00:38:45.137 --> 00:38:46.267
LIAM: Now I got three, right?

00:38:46.267 --> 00:38:47.127
LAURA: Yeah, you've got three.

00:38:47.127 --> 00:38:49.606
LIAM: Clawing these two, and bird rider.

00:38:49.606 --> 00:38:51.087
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: So how are you doing?

00:38:51.087 --> 00:38:52.677
You all right?

00:38:52.677 --> 00:38:53.510
LIAM: Feel great.

00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:54.687
MARISHA: Okay. (laughs)

00:38:54.687 --> 00:38:55.754
MATT: All right.
TALIESIN: Full speed.

00:38:55.754 --> 00:38:56.587
SAM: Full speed?

00:38:56.587 --> 00:38:58.637
MATT: So you are now with who?

00:38:58.637 --> 00:38:59.517
You are you're with--

00:38:59.517 --> 00:39:01.891
LIAM: I apparently am holding these two assholes

00:39:01.891 --> 00:39:03.536
and Yasha riding.
MATT: And Yasha.

00:39:03.536 --> 00:39:04.369
You are slowing.

00:39:04.369 --> 00:39:06.377
SAM: (groans)

00:39:06.377 --> 00:39:09.609
LIAM: Now I'm 80 normally, so am I half that?

00:39:09.609 --> 00:39:10.907
MATT: Currently you are moving 40 per move.

00:39:10.907 --> 00:39:12.107
You can go 80 in a turn.

00:39:13.177 --> 00:39:14.576
ASHLEY: I can run faster than this.

00:39:14.576 --> 00:39:16.626
MARISHA: So can I!
TRAVIS: Guys,

00:39:16.626 --> 00:39:18.112
the math is right there.

00:39:18.112 --> 00:39:19.170
What the fuck?

00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:20.767
MATT: The good news is, for the time that you're traveling

00:39:20.767 --> 00:39:21.857
you're not leaving tracks, I guess.

00:39:21.857 --> 00:39:23.989
MARISHA: Yeah, not leaving tracks is good.

00:39:23.989 --> 00:39:26.889
SAM: Just drop her, just drop her!

00:39:26.889 --> 00:39:27.730
Again.

00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:30.417
MARISHA: How much distance have we cleared?

00:39:30.417 --> 00:39:33.237
MATT: You've been going for, I'll say at this point,

00:39:33.237 --> 00:39:35.308
close to 10 minutes since the battle,

00:39:35.308 --> 00:39:36.982
so you've gotten a fair distance.

00:39:36.982 --> 00:39:39.547
You're not entirely certain how well they're traveling.

00:39:39.547 --> 00:39:40.557
You've traveled with them

00:39:40.557 --> 00:39:42.237
on the pace of you traveling as a group,

00:39:42.237 --> 00:39:44.592
which can only move as fast as the slowest person.

00:39:44.592 --> 00:39:47.007
You're uncertain how quick their ability is

00:39:47.007 --> 00:39:50.536
to traverse this terrain, comparison to what you're doing.

00:39:50.536 --> 00:39:51.817
You do not know.
TRAVIS: Who's perceptive?

00:39:51.817 --> 00:39:52.697
TALIESIN: I am.
SAM: Him.

00:39:52.697 --> 00:39:55.410
Hey, Beauregard, how fast can you move in a turn, 120?

00:39:56.874 --> 00:39:58.599
MARISHA: I can run-- what is it,

00:39:59.499 --> 00:40:01.332
150 feet or something like that.

00:40:01.332 --> 00:40:02.911
LAURA: What, why are we fucking-- get off.

00:40:02.911 --> 00:40:04.620
SAM: Yeah, why don't we drop Beau?

00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:06.787
MARISHA: I mentioned that earlier, but it's because

00:40:06.787 --> 00:40:08.077
I have low HP.
LAURA: Who cares, it's fine.

00:40:08.077 --> 00:40:10.047
MARISHA: But as long as you all keep your eyes on me

00:40:10.047 --> 00:40:11.166
I should be fine.

00:40:11.166 --> 00:40:13.167
SAM: Yeah, drop Beau.
TALIESIN: Hold on.

00:40:13.167 --> 00:40:14.136
TRAVIS: Where's my health potion?

00:40:14.136 --> 00:40:15.795
TALIESIN: Who are you-- you're--

00:40:15.795 --> 00:40:16.807
MARISHA: I'm with Caleb.

00:40:16.807 --> 00:40:18.677
TALIESIN: Okay, damn it, I need to touch for--

00:40:18.677 --> 00:40:19.972
MARISHA: Wait, we're together now?

00:40:19.972 --> 00:40:21.439
TRAVIS: Can you drink a fucking health potion?

00:40:21.439 --> 00:40:23.047
MARISHA: Here's the thing. I can--

00:40:23.047 --> 00:40:24.880
if you can drop a heal into me,

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:27.481
honestly if I'm on the ground I don't think--

00:40:27.481 --> 00:40:29.467
because I have Water Walk, does that mean

00:40:29.467 --> 00:40:31.827
I could run across the snow and not leave footprints?

00:40:31.827 --> 00:40:32.660
MATT: That is not true.

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:34.357
MARISHA: Oh come on, it's water!
MATT: Snow and water

00:40:34.357 --> 00:40:36.319
do not have the exact same--

00:40:36.319 --> 00:40:37.817
LAURA: Bummer.
MATT: -- element there.

00:40:37.817 --> 00:40:40.309
MARISHA: They don't have the same chemical make-up?

00:40:41.557 --> 00:40:42.390
MATT: They don't have the same

00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:43.606
structure.
TRAVIS: What a face.

00:40:43.606 --> 00:40:45.907
MATT: It's the difference between a

00:40:45.907 --> 00:40:47.677
liquid and a solid here.
MARISHA: That's fair.

00:40:47.677 --> 00:40:48.510
No, that's fair.

00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:50.897
MATT: Surface tension is a whole thing, nah.

00:40:50.897 --> 00:40:53.748
TALIESIN: I can technically run
across ice without leaving a track,

00:40:53.748 --> 00:40:55.337
so that's pretty cool.
MARISHA: I just want to feel like Legolas.

00:40:55.337 --> 00:40:57.087
LIAM: Caleb for the last two minutes has been saying

00:40:57.087 --> 00:41:00.327
"We should destroy it, we should destroy it!"

00:41:00.327 --> 00:41:02.267
but everyone just hears-- (screeching)

00:41:02.267 --> 00:41:03.400
LAURA: Stop yelling!

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:04.768
(screeching continues)

00:41:04.768 --> 00:41:07.025
MARISHA: The birds seems so over-taxed.

00:41:07.025 --> 00:41:08.547
I think they're in a lot of pain.

00:41:08.547 --> 00:41:09.707
MATT: Yeah, well the good news is,

00:41:09.707 --> 00:41:11.607
and you pick up on this as soon as he started screaming,

00:41:11.607 --> 00:41:13.339
is if they had lost you for a while,

00:41:13.339 --> 00:41:16.197
the screams of the various large birds in the sky

00:41:16.197 --> 00:41:17.897
might give them something to follow.

00:41:17.897 --> 00:41:19.203
LAURA: Oh.
MARISHA: Son of a bitch.

00:41:19.203 --> 00:41:20.307
Just drop me, dude.

00:41:20.307 --> 00:41:22.387
SAM: Shut the fuck up.
ASHLEY: I reach out

00:41:22.387 --> 00:41:26.329
to Beau and cast Healing Hands.

00:41:26.329 --> 00:41:27.162
MATT: Okay.

00:41:27.162 --> 00:41:29.067
ASHLEY: So you restore 13 points.

00:41:29.067 --> 00:41:30.500
MARISHA: Great, I'll take it.

00:41:32.067 --> 00:41:32.990
MATT: Awesome.

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:36.057
TALIESIN: And I'll throw a bonus
Healing Word at you at level two.

00:41:36.057 --> 00:41:37.830
MATT: What's the distance on Healing Word?

00:41:39.197 --> 00:41:40.030
TALIESIN: 60 feet.

00:41:41.307 --> 00:41:42.667
MATT: Yeah, you're staying close enough.

00:41:42.667 --> 00:41:45.027
You're staying clustered, I'd say you can do that.

00:41:45.027 --> 00:41:46.517
TALIESIN: It aint much, but you know, it's--

00:41:46.517 --> 00:41:47.700
MATT: It all helps.
TALIESIN: Hey!

00:41:48.927 --> 00:41:51.317
12, you first.
MARISHA: So wait, what was that?

00:41:51.317 --> 00:41:52.457
13 from you?

00:41:52.457 --> 00:41:53.539
TALIESIN: And then 12 from me.
SAM: (belches)

00:41:53.539 --> 00:41:55.195
MATT: 12 from Caduceus, so 25 total.

00:41:55.195 --> 00:41:56.028
MARISHA: Great.

00:41:56.028 --> 00:41:58.398
LAURA: So terrible, Sam.

00:41:58.398 --> 00:41:59.952
TRAVIS: Your mustache is falling out.

00:41:59.952 --> 00:42:02.957
SAM: What I don't understand is--
MATT: It's curling up.

00:42:02.957 --> 00:42:06.330
SAM: -- they didn't have to get real espresso.

00:42:08.889 --> 00:42:10.397
It could've been anything.

00:42:10.397 --> 00:42:13.305
TALIESIN: You could've sent a more specific email.
ASHLEY: This is why our crew is the best.

00:42:13.305 --> 00:42:15.613
MATT: Yeah, our channel is committed to quality

00:42:15.613 --> 00:42:17.747
and legitimacy, Sam. You should know this by now.

00:42:17.747 --> 00:42:19.247
TRAVIS: You get what you ask for.
SAM: It could have been anything.

00:42:19.247 --> 00:42:21.345
It's an opaque cup.

00:42:22.239 --> 00:42:23.389
It could have been water.

00:42:23.389 --> 00:42:26.340
TRAVIS: You could have written hot sauce and water,

00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:29.252
and Scope mouthwash.
TALIESIN: Did you put

00:42:29.252 --> 00:42:30.838
"(water)" next to everything?

00:42:30.838 --> 00:42:32.304
SAM: I didn't.
TALIESIN: Well, there--

00:42:32.304 --> 00:42:33.577
MARISHA: Are you shaming the crew for

00:42:33.577 --> 00:42:35.291
following directions?
SAM: No, they're great.

00:42:35.291 --> 00:42:37.012
They're the best fucking crew in show business.

00:42:37.012 --> 00:42:39.496
(laughter)

00:42:39.496 --> 00:42:40.829
TRAVIS: So say we all.

00:42:41.687 --> 00:42:42.520
MATT: So.

00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:44.711
(laughter)

00:42:44.711 --> 00:42:46.737
Caleb is slowing down to half speed,

00:42:46.737 --> 00:42:47.917
clutching this crew.

00:42:47.917 --> 00:42:49.657
You've been healed a little bit.

00:42:49.657 --> 00:42:51.537
You're uncertain if you're being tailed still.

00:42:51.537 --> 00:42:52.370
What are you doing?

00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:54.739
TRAVIS: We tried to hit the shit
out of that lodestone previously

00:42:54.739 --> 00:42:57.940
with blades, magical weapons. It doesn't do much.

00:42:57.940 --> 00:43:00.127
MARISHA: Can anyone magically teleport it away?

00:43:00.127 --> 00:43:02.167
TRAVIS: I don't think so.
LAURA: No, not right now.

00:43:02.167 --> 00:43:04.259
MARISHA: Not right now, after we get away?
MATT: With a rest--

00:43:04.259 --> 00:43:05.858
MATT: With a rest I think you have an option or--

00:43:05.858 --> 00:43:09.286
MARISHA: Because it's three days to the lava or we sleep.
LAURA: Sure, with a rest we got a fuck ton of stuff to do.

00:43:09.286 --> 00:43:11.337
LIAM: We could do all kinds of stuff if we could rest.

00:43:11.337 --> 00:43:14.043
LAURA: We just have to get somewhere we can rest.

00:43:14.043 --> 00:43:15.444
TRAVIS: I don't think we're resting.

00:43:15.444 --> 00:43:17.634
A rest is an illusion, because they'll keep going.

00:43:17.634 --> 00:43:19.180
LAURA: They don't sleep!

00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:20.957
They don't have to rest!
TRAVIS: Yeah, they don't sleep.

00:43:20.957 --> 00:43:22.321
LAURA: Whatever we do, they're going to catch up.

00:43:22.321 --> 00:43:24.437
MARISHA: Even if we lose them, it could give us time.

00:43:24.437 --> 00:43:25.803
TALIESIN: We're never going to lose them.

00:43:25.803 --> 00:43:27.031
LAURA: They have our blood!

00:43:27.031 --> 00:43:29.281
TRAVIS: They found us after we had a day advantage,

00:43:29.281 --> 00:43:33.148
in a snow storm, hidden, outside, and covered in snow.

00:43:33.148 --> 00:43:35.467
They are locked onto us, or something in us.

00:43:35.467 --> 00:43:36.787
TALIESIN: Yeah, there's no running away.

00:43:36.787 --> 00:43:38.587
ASHLEY: How far are we from Aeor?

00:43:40.068 --> 00:43:43.057
TRAVIS: I'm guessing a day and a half?

00:43:43.057 --> 00:43:46.137
MATT: No, you were going to reach it the next day,

00:43:46.137 --> 00:43:49.897
like mid-day is what you were told, so--

00:43:50.981 --> 00:43:52.152
SAM: We can bank around.

00:43:52.152 --> 00:43:53.947
MATT: You're probably a number of hours away

00:43:53.947 --> 00:43:57.484
from where you think, based on the map, where Aeor would be,

00:43:57.484 --> 00:44:00.667
though you have no previous experience in the area.

00:44:00.667 --> 00:44:03.107
You're not quite sure what you're looking for.

00:44:03.107 --> 00:44:03.940
You don't know.

00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:05.620
TRAVIS: And it's in the middle of the night.
MATT: Yeah.

00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:07.601
ASHLEY: And is Essek around that area?

00:44:07.601 --> 00:44:09.175
TRAVIS: He's on the other side of the city from us.

00:44:09.175 --> 00:44:10.990
ASHLEY: That's right.
TRAVIS: So he's as far as he could be.

00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:13.048
ASHLEY: Fuck.
SAM: Oh no.

00:44:13.048 --> 00:44:15.130
Home Alone moment.

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:16.611
Dagen!

00:44:16.611 --> 00:44:17.608
TALIESIN: Dagen's--

00:44:17.608 --> 00:44:18.541
LAURA: Dagen's gone-- no, we already

00:44:18.541 --> 00:44:20.213
sent Dagen on the way.
MATT: You sent him ahead.

00:44:20.213 --> 00:44:21.786
SAM: Okay, okay, okay.

00:44:21.786 --> 00:44:22.952
TRAVIS: (high-pitched) Kevin!

00:44:22.952 --> 00:44:25.394
TALIESIN: That's more of a grandpa moment.
MATT: Yeah, you sent him ahead.

00:44:25.394 --> 00:44:26.477
SAM: Okay, okay.

00:44:28.087 --> 00:44:29.897
LAURA: I like to imagine that Artagan

00:44:29.897 --> 00:44:31.760
is just flying behind us laughing.

00:44:32.877 --> 00:44:34.443
MATT: He's probably laughing pretty hard.
TRAVIS: Who's got high perception

00:44:34.443 --> 00:44:36.484
that can make a check besides Caduceus?

00:44:36.484 --> 00:44:37.457
TALIESIN: Going to keep looking.

00:44:37.457 --> 00:44:38.515
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:44:38.515 --> 00:44:40.098
TALIESIN: Actually, hold on.
MARISHA: I have passive perception.

00:44:40.098 --> 00:44:41.600
TRAVIS: Look for that flash, man.

00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:43.631
TALIESIN: Can I do a thing?
MARISHA: Keep scanning I guess, but--

00:44:43.631 --> 00:44:45.056
TRAVIS: I'll assist you.

00:44:46.567 --> 00:44:48.337
TALIESIN: Yeah, I can actually add a d4 to that, too,

00:44:48.337 --> 00:44:50.551
since I can just sort of give myself a little boost

00:44:50.551 --> 00:44:52.367
when I'm looking and peer.

00:44:52.367 --> 00:44:53.200
MATT: Sure.

00:44:58.787 --> 00:44:59.887
TALIESIN: 18.

00:44:59.887 --> 00:45:00.720
MATT: 18?

00:45:01.753 --> 00:45:03.770
Still is hard to see but from what you can tell

00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:05.657
you don't see any signs of being followed,

00:45:05.657 --> 00:45:09.117
but it is still thick with snow in the sky around you.

00:45:09.117 --> 00:45:10.967
TALIESIN: Hard to see. I don't trust my eyes yet.

00:45:10.967 --> 00:45:12.437
TRAVIS: Fair.

00:45:12.437 --> 00:45:14.983
TALIESIN: Do we want to veer a little?

00:45:14.983 --> 00:45:16.008
TRAVIS: Which way?

00:45:16.008 --> 00:45:17.958
TALIESIN: Just-- (sighs)

00:45:17.958 --> 00:45:19.917
LAURA: If you want to go somewhere, just pull me.

00:45:19.917 --> 00:45:20.797
TALIESIN: It's all the same.

00:45:20.797 --> 00:45:22.926
LAURA: Just yell it out because I'm just flying.

00:45:22.926 --> 00:45:24.732
TRAVIS: Do you want to head towards the mountain line

00:45:24.732 --> 00:45:26.777
or do you want to head towards Aeor?

00:45:26.777 --> 00:45:29.027
Because we're heading in that direction.

00:45:31.061 --> 00:45:32.079
Mountains on the left.

00:45:32.079 --> 00:45:35.218
Aeor-ish on the right, depending on how hard we turned

00:45:35.218 --> 00:45:38.167
in the middle of the night, which we have no idea of.

00:45:38.167 --> 00:45:41.197
TALIESIN: My heart says Aeor, my gut says mountains.

00:45:41.197 --> 00:45:43.337
I'm not sure what to pick.

00:45:43.337 --> 00:45:45.027
Are you running down there?

00:45:45.027 --> 00:45:46.576
MARISHA: I don't know. I don't know if you dropped me.

00:45:46.576 --> 00:45:47.632
LAURA: No, he hasn't dropped you.

00:45:47.632 --> 00:45:50.780
LIAM: If you yell at me I'll do anything you want.

00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:52.192
TALIESIN: Because if you run you're
going to have to jump a lot.

00:45:52.192 --> 00:45:53.737
SAM: Just like in real life.

00:45:53.737 --> 00:45:54.570
MARISHA: Jump a lot?

00:45:54.570 --> 00:45:56.237
TALIESIN: Leave less tracks.
MARISHA: Leave less tracks?

00:45:57.752 --> 00:45:59.058
I technically do that.

00:45:59.058 --> 00:46:00.793
SAM: Run like a deer.

00:46:02.547 --> 00:46:05.387
MARISHA: Well, okay, I'm conversing with Fjord

00:46:05.387 --> 00:46:07.710
as I know we can talk, and those who can talk.

00:46:10.197 --> 00:46:12.337
MARISHA: We got to rest in one option or another.

00:46:12.337 --> 00:46:15.277
Either three days to the lava flow or a day

00:46:15.277 --> 00:46:17.457
to get this thing teleported away.

00:46:17.457 --> 00:46:18.897
There's got to be resting somewhere.

00:46:18.897 --> 00:46:19.897
We just got to figure out

00:46:19.897 --> 00:46:22.008
where we're going to hide ourselves.
TRAVIS: I would take the second.

00:46:22.008 --> 00:46:25.742
I would rest and teleport it away, than three days.

00:46:25.742 --> 00:46:27.408
SAM: If we can do that.
MARISHA: Then let's--

00:46:27.408 --> 00:46:29.977
TRAVIS: Send them-- if it's gone--
MARISHA: Then lets get to the mountains.

00:46:29.977 --> 00:46:31.197
MARISHA: If we can get to--
TRAVIS: If we send them

00:46:31.197 --> 00:46:32.517
to another location,

00:46:32.517 --> 00:46:34.616
which buys us a couple weeks potentially,

00:46:34.616 --> 00:46:36.802
but that three day thing they'll catch us.

00:46:36.802 --> 00:46:37.935
MARISHA: Then let's go to the mountains.

00:46:37.935 --> 00:46:39.660
If we can get to the top of the mountains,

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:41.397
because we haven't seen the Tomb Takers

00:46:41.397 --> 00:46:42.817
fly yet really, right?

00:46:42.817 --> 00:46:43.650
TRAVIS: Haven't <i>seen</i> them.

00:46:43.650 --> 00:46:45.314
MATT: You have not seen them.
MARISHA: Haven't <i>seen</i> them.

00:46:45.314 --> 00:46:46.412
MARISHA: If we get to the top of the mountains

00:46:46.412 --> 00:46:48.727
we might be able to--
TRAVIS: They have a mage.

00:46:48.727 --> 00:46:50.929
MARISHA: Get a day ahead of us.
TRAVIS: Otis is a mage, right?

00:46:50.929 --> 00:46:52.315
LAURA: Otis?
MATT: Otis seems to be

00:46:52.315 --> 00:46:54.537
some practitioner of magic.

00:46:54.537 --> 00:46:55.887
SAM: They have a blood hunter.

00:46:56.787 --> 00:46:57.627
LAURA: Yeah.

00:46:57.627 --> 00:47:01.253
MARISHA: Otis was the one that was
throwing the Eldritch Blasts

00:47:01.253 --> 00:47:02.087
and shit right?
MATT: Correct.

00:47:02.087 --> 00:47:05.449
TRAVIS: Otis is the fucking bitch that picked my pocket.

00:47:05.449 --> 00:47:06.932
MATT: Yep.
LAURA: Yeah, Otis sucks.

00:47:06.932 --> 00:47:08.527
Otis is the one you tried to kill

00:47:08.527 --> 00:47:09.687
and then you didn't see--

00:47:09.687 --> 00:47:12.597
SAM: Otis sucks. Otis is a female, correct?

00:47:12.597 --> 00:47:14.547
MATT: Otis actually goes by all pronouns.

00:47:14.547 --> 00:47:16.964
SAM: Oh, I did not know that, okay.
TRAVIS: Halfling.

00:47:16.964 --> 00:47:17.927
TALIESIN: All of the above.

00:47:17.927 --> 00:47:19.760
SAM: I still fucking hate Otis.

00:47:20.697 --> 00:47:23.537
MATT: Hey, all pronouns are viable and your hate is earned

00:47:23.537 --> 00:47:25.517
because Otis is terrible.

00:47:25.517 --> 00:47:26.350
SAM: Sure.

00:47:26.350 --> 00:47:28.158
They are the worst.
TALIESIN: They are the worst.

00:47:30.267 --> 00:47:32.394
TALIESIN: Yeah, there's no good answer here.

00:47:32.394 --> 00:47:33.831
MARISHA: Then let's go for the mountains.

00:47:33.831 --> 00:47:35.472
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure.
MARISHA: Right?

00:47:35.472 --> 00:47:38.009
That feels right, so we got to rest.

00:47:38.009 --> 00:47:40.203
TALIESIN: Nice, we get as far as we can before we--

00:47:40.203 --> 00:47:41.596
TRAVIS: As long as we do have a

00:47:41.596 --> 00:47:43.500
"get this thing out of here permanently" spell.

00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:46.486
LIAM: Buy a little bit of time
to try some things to this shit--

00:47:46.486 --> 00:47:48.018
TRAVIS: For sure.
LIAM: --while they can't quite reach us.

00:47:48.018 --> 00:47:50.577
LAURA: If it's been 10 minutes my Polymorph is out.

00:47:50.577 --> 00:47:52.588
MATT: You're getting real close to
the end of your Polymorph now.

00:47:52.588 --> 00:47:54.487
Are you pushing in the direction of the mountain range,

00:47:54.487 --> 00:47:56.147
so you're now curving northward?

00:47:56.147 --> 00:47:57.704
Okay.
TRAVIS: Bearing slightly left, yeah.

00:47:57.704 --> 00:47:59.007
Okay.
MARISHA: Then how about this?

00:47:59.007 --> 00:48:01.637
Drop me and let's fucking haul ass

00:48:01.637 --> 00:48:03.247
for the last 10 minutes of your all's Polymorph.

00:48:03.247 --> 00:48:04.364
LIAM: Until we reach the mountains.

00:48:04.364 --> 00:48:06.897
TRAVIS: And drop down to what, 15 feet above the deck,

00:48:06.897 --> 00:48:07.997
just flying low?

00:48:07.997 --> 00:48:09.919
LAURA: Yeah, for the last 10 minutes.

00:48:09.919 --> 00:48:11.967
MARISHA: For the last 10 minutes and go as fast as we can.

00:48:11.967 --> 00:48:12.927
MATT: Okay, all right.

00:48:12.927 --> 00:48:14.709
So in doing that, you drop Beauregard

00:48:14.709 --> 00:48:17.648
but you can go a 100 feet a round,
150 with a ki point.

00:48:17.648 --> 00:48:19.321
But remember you have a limited number of ki points.

00:48:19.321 --> 00:48:21.287
MARISHA: I do have limited number of ki points.

00:48:21.287 --> 00:48:23.754
I still have a decent amount.

00:48:23.754 --> 00:48:24.707
Here's what I'm going to do.

00:48:24.707 --> 00:48:29.125
Every other round, let's see it's every six seconds or so.

00:48:29.125 --> 00:48:32.466
Let me see how many ki points I have left.

00:48:33.577 --> 00:48:34.410
MATT: You'll eventually--

00:48:34.410 --> 00:48:36.489
they'll have to catch up to you regardless.

00:48:36.489 --> 00:48:37.727
MARISHA: Because it's Step of the Wind

00:48:37.727 --> 00:48:39.467
where also my jump speed doubles,

00:48:39.467 --> 00:48:40.765
so I am going to do

00:48:40.765 --> 00:48:42.447
the deer lover shit.
MATT: So yeah.

00:48:42.447 --> 00:48:44.507
Okay, so after you drop Beauregard

00:48:45.377 --> 00:48:47.197
it's like watching this sudden...

00:48:48.337 --> 00:48:51.102
grinding jet ski only, instead of water, it's on snow.

00:48:51.102 --> 00:48:53.031
Just-- (grinding, boof)

00:48:53.031 --> 00:48:54.946
(grinding, boof)

00:48:54.946 --> 00:48:55.829
(grinding, boof)
TRAVIS: Dope.

00:48:55.829 --> 00:48:58.557
MATT: And it's just leaving these
sprays and trails and then nothing.

00:48:58.557 --> 00:49:00.795
These long paths, these arcs.

00:49:00.795 --> 00:49:02.687
Yeah, full on arms out Naruto run.

00:49:02.687 --> 00:49:05.867
LIAM: I'm thinking Crouching Tiger, Chow Yun-Fat, just arc.

00:49:05.867 --> 00:49:08.637
MATT: Yeah, just darting to and from.

00:49:08.637 --> 00:49:12.697
And keeping it at a faint zigzag but way ahead of you.

00:49:12.697 --> 00:49:15.050
Once again, dope monk shit.

00:49:16.758 --> 00:49:18.597
You lose your Polymorph-- or you feel yourself

00:49:18.597 --> 00:49:19.630
coming to the end of the Polymorph

00:49:19.630 --> 00:49:23.307
and right as you come out of your form,

00:49:23.307 --> 00:49:25.894
Fjord, you go ahead and feel yourself being dropped.

00:49:25.894 --> 00:49:27.188
Caduceus, you feel yourself losing that--

00:49:27.188 --> 00:49:28.021
LAURA: Oh wait,

00:49:28.021 --> 00:49:29.805
Fjord is not on me.
LIAM: I have Fjord.

00:49:29.805 --> 00:49:30.638
MATT: Oh right, sorry.

00:49:30.638 --> 00:49:32.594
LAURA: And I would have known my
Polymorph was coming to an end

00:49:32.594 --> 00:49:35.008
at least a little bit, so I
would have been lower to the ground.

00:49:35.008 --> 00:49:36.883
MATT: Right, yeah. You would have gotten down.

00:49:36.883 --> 00:49:38.457
You would have a moment to cast it,

00:49:38.457 --> 00:49:39.797
if you wanted to land, and then go ahead

00:49:39.797 --> 00:49:42.247
and pick back up and take off with everyone else.

00:49:43.797 --> 00:49:44.927
LAURA: Hold on, let me look at something.

00:49:44.927 --> 00:49:45.760
MATT: Okay.

00:49:46.807 --> 00:49:49.097
LAURA: Yeah, that's really the most useful thing

00:49:49.097 --> 00:49:50.327
that's going to happen, so yeah.

00:49:50.327 --> 00:49:51.160
MATT: Okay, so with that--

00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:53.349
LAURA: But I'm going to-- instead of turning into an owl

00:49:53.349 --> 00:49:54.587
this time, I'm going to turn into an eagle

00:49:54.587 --> 00:49:56.404
because their speed is more than an owl's.

00:49:56.404 --> 00:49:57.237
MATT: Got it.

00:49:57.237 --> 00:49:59.561
LAURA: So an eagle can go 80 feet

00:49:59.561 --> 00:50:01.594
per round.
MATT: Okay, you got it.

00:50:01.594 --> 00:50:03.457
So now with you taking on your eagle form,

00:50:03.457 --> 00:50:06.230
you pick up Caduceus.

00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:07.882
TALIESIN: All right, I was taking that moment of sitting

00:50:07.882 --> 00:50:09.959
to watch and see if anyone's following us.

00:50:09.959 --> 00:50:12.220
TRAVIS: I'll assist you.
MATT: You got it.

00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:14.029
TALIESIN: I was just keeping an eye open.

00:50:14.029 --> 00:50:16.126
LAURA: And their strength is higher than an owl.
TALIESIN: No.

00:50:16.126 --> 00:50:17.433
MATT: Good to know.

00:50:18.483 --> 00:50:19.882
TALIESIN: I don't see anything.

00:50:19.882 --> 00:50:21.400
MATT: But you continue to push on.

00:50:22.517 --> 00:50:26.057
You have about, I'd say roughly--

00:50:26.057 --> 00:50:27.290
LIAM: Five or 10, I mean I--

00:50:29.114 --> 00:50:30.597
LAURA: No, no, no, because I only had 20 minutes left

00:50:30.597 --> 00:50:31.430
on the Polymorph.
MATT: Correct.

00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:32.997
So you'd have another 40 minutes or so to go.

00:50:32.997 --> 00:50:34.513
LIAM: Right, I went fresh in the battle.

00:50:34.513 --> 00:50:35.491
MATT: Exactly.
LIAM: Oh right, yep.

00:50:36.017 --> 00:50:38.507
MATT: So you guys manage to cruise on ahead for a bit.

00:50:38.507 --> 00:50:39.847
Go ahead and make another roll for me

00:50:39.847 --> 00:50:41.227
as you guys are pushing on in that direction.

00:50:41.227 --> 00:50:42.757
LIAM: I'll look too, I've got Keen Sight.

00:50:42.757 --> 00:50:45.047
MATT: Okay, go for it.

00:50:45.047 --> 00:50:47.007
LIAM: Is it still snowy as shit, though?

00:50:47.007 --> 00:50:49.117
MATT: Yeah.
LIAM: All right, so a straight roll.

00:50:49.117 --> 00:50:51.177
TALIESIN: Nope.
LIAM: 17.

00:50:51.177 --> 00:50:52.597
LAURA: I'm going to be, instead of a blue eagle

00:50:52.597 --> 00:50:53.777
like I normally am,

00:50:53.777 --> 00:50:55.287
I'm going to turn into a black eagle

00:50:55.287 --> 00:50:57.507
so I blend in with the night time a little better.

00:50:57.507 --> 00:50:59.157
MATT: Okay, you got it.

00:50:59.157 --> 00:50:59.990
SAM: Nice.

00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:01.407
LAURA: Thanks.

00:51:01.407 --> 00:51:04.137
MATT: Pushing on for about another 10 or so minutes,

00:51:04.137 --> 00:51:08.657
20 or so minutes, you do not see any signs

00:51:08.657 --> 00:51:10.387
of anything immediately around you

00:51:10.387 --> 00:51:12.427
that catches your attention.

00:51:12.427 --> 00:51:14.847
You have no idea whether you've lost them

00:51:14.847 --> 00:51:15.777
or they're tracking you,

00:51:15.777 --> 00:51:19.437
but you do not see them keeping pace.

00:51:19.437 --> 00:51:22.017
There are no signs of them nearby.

00:51:22.017 --> 00:51:24.747
The snow and the storm has lessened

00:51:24.747 --> 00:51:27.527
in its intensity slightly,

00:51:27.527 --> 00:51:28.790
but it is still present.

00:51:30.557 --> 00:51:31.957
But you continue to push on.

00:51:35.387 --> 00:51:37.637
It'll take you guys a little bit

00:51:37.637 --> 00:51:39.440
to get towards the mountain range.

00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:40.587
LAURA: How long?

00:51:40.587 --> 00:51:42.767
MATT: I'd say about another hour and a half

00:51:43.697 --> 00:51:45.657
to get up into the mountain range itself.

00:51:45.657 --> 00:51:47.830
LAURA: Up into the mountains?

00:51:47.830 --> 00:51:51.317
I've got one more spell that I can use for Polymorph,

00:51:51.317 --> 00:51:52.680
so I can keep flying.

00:51:54.017 --> 00:51:55.901
TRAVIS: Yeah, max them out and then we walk

00:51:55.901 --> 00:51:57.459
and we keep going, and we keep going.

00:51:57.459 --> 00:51:58.517
LIAM: I've got two more in me.

00:51:58.517 --> 00:52:01.287
LAURA: Okay, so when we can get up
into the-- we can get above.

00:52:01.287 --> 00:52:03.820
We'll pick Beau up once we get close to the mountains

00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:05.014
so we can get height.

00:52:05.014 --> 00:52:07.107
So it will take them much longer

00:52:07.107 --> 00:52:08.297
to trek through the mountains.

00:52:08.297 --> 00:52:11.177
Get to like a peak, something that would be

00:52:11.177 --> 00:52:12.967
very hard for them to get to.

00:52:12.967 --> 00:52:15.160
MATT: Okay. All right.

00:52:16.257 --> 00:52:17.797
In juggling these spell slots

00:52:17.797 --> 00:52:19.877
and pushing through cold and freezing,

00:52:19.877 --> 00:52:23.207
I need everybody, including the eagles,

00:52:23.207 --> 00:52:25.634
to go ahead and make a constitution saving throw.

00:52:25.634 --> 00:52:27.147
LIAM: Also, on one of the landings

00:52:27.147 --> 00:52:28.897
where we would have done crossovers

00:52:29.988 --> 00:52:31.537
Caleb would have fallen out of eagle just for a moment

00:52:31.537 --> 00:52:33.947
to say once we reach high ground,

00:52:33.947 --> 00:52:36.237
if we do reach high ground, it might not work,

00:52:36.237 --> 00:52:39.047
but I want to try to lift that stone

00:52:39.047 --> 00:52:42.057
as far into the sky as I can and then drag it back down

00:52:42.057 --> 00:52:44.317
and nose dive it into the face of the mountain.

00:52:44.317 --> 00:52:45.937
TRAVIS: Ooh, sure.

00:52:45.937 --> 00:52:47.400
LIAM: But I will have to do it,

00:52:48.597 --> 00:52:50.187
I will just barely make it to the mountain.

00:52:50.187 --> 00:52:51.719
So it'll be the last thing I do before I'm done.

00:52:51.719 --> 00:52:53.637
LAURA: We could lose it, we could lose the stone.

00:52:53.637 --> 00:52:55.310
TRAVIS: He controls where it goes.

00:52:55.310 --> 00:52:56.617
LIAM: I'm going to fly it down to the ground,

00:52:56.617 --> 00:52:57.517
I'm going to be right next to it,

00:52:57.517 --> 00:52:59.969
I'm not going to huck it into the distance.

00:52:59.969 --> 00:53:00.802
I'm going to bring it up

00:53:00.802 --> 00:53:02.677
and then I'm going to dive, myself included,

00:53:02.677 --> 00:53:05.970
towards-- Near you all; I'm not going to fly away from you.

00:53:05.970 --> 00:53:08.287
I'm going to try to dash it into the rocks.

00:53:08.287 --> 00:53:10.097
MATT: So constitution saving throws.

00:53:10.097 --> 00:53:11.248
LAURA: Yes.
TRAVIS: 21.

00:53:11.248 --> 00:53:12.081
MATT: 21.

00:53:13.137 --> 00:53:15.097
LIAM: And this is bird stats, right?

00:53:15.097 --> 00:53:15.930
MATT: Yep.

00:53:17.087 --> 00:53:18.490
LIAM: ♪ Bird stats. ♪
MATT: Jester?

00:53:18.490 --> 00:53:21.257
LAURA: ♪ Five! ♪
Oh, wait, bird stats.

00:53:21.257 --> 00:53:23.210
I'm sure it's just as good.

00:53:26.976 --> 00:53:29.254
(laughter)

00:53:29.254 --> 00:53:30.162
♪ Three! ♪

00:53:30.162 --> 00:53:32.598
TRAVIS: Stop rolling in that damn cake.

00:53:32.598 --> 00:53:34.057
LIAM: The cake is a lie.

00:53:34.057 --> 00:53:36.225
MATT: So both of you suffer a point of exhaustion.

00:53:36.225 --> 00:53:38.337
LAURA: Great.
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck.

00:53:38.337 --> 00:53:39.960
MATT: In this form.

00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:41.097
LAURA: Okay. Okay.
MATT: It doesn't do much

00:53:41.097 --> 00:53:42.647
for you right now, other than

00:53:42.647 --> 00:53:45.117
fuck up ability checks at the moment.

00:53:45.117 --> 00:53:46.017
TRAVIS: The second one will be speed.

00:53:46.017 --> 00:53:47.867
MATT: But the second one's going to slow your speeds.

00:53:47.867 --> 00:53:49.496
We'll see when we get to that.

00:53:49.496 --> 00:53:50.329
SAM: Five.

00:53:50.329 --> 00:53:51.817
MATT: Point of exhaustion to you.

00:53:51.817 --> 00:53:54.287
ASHLEY: 16.
MATT: You're fine.

00:53:54.287 --> 00:53:55.977
TALIESIN: 19.
MATT: You're fine.

00:53:55.977 --> 00:53:57.577
MARISHA: 15.
MATT: You're fine.

00:53:57.577 --> 00:53:59.630
MARISHA: Oh, whoa, okay.

00:54:00.897 --> 00:54:05.457
MATT: Continuing on for the next final casting of slots

00:54:05.457 --> 00:54:08.007
where you're saying for the
final leg of this Polymorph spell,

00:54:08.007 --> 00:54:10.977
you begin to just see the faint shape,

00:54:10.977 --> 00:54:12.927
that odd moment

00:54:12.927 --> 00:54:14.857
where your eyes have adjusted to the darkness

00:54:14.857 --> 00:54:15.977
and what little bit of light

00:54:15.977 --> 00:54:17.437
peeks through the cloud cover above,

00:54:17.437 --> 00:54:20.027
you can just barely make out the ragged shape

00:54:20.027 --> 00:54:21.437
of the mountain range in the distance,

00:54:21.437 --> 00:54:24.277
just beyond the hints of snow and gray

00:54:24.277 --> 00:54:26.517
that fill in everything ahead of you.

00:54:26.517 --> 00:54:28.237
Pushing still, your body's going numb,

00:54:28.237 --> 00:54:30.717
your muscles are locking up cold,

00:54:30.717 --> 00:54:34.257
you're shivering heavily involuntarily across the board

00:54:34.257 --> 00:54:36.997
and you keep pushing on into these twilight hours

00:54:36.997 --> 00:54:39.160
trying to reach some semblance of safety.

00:54:40.437 --> 00:54:43.197
For this final leg, and the last use of these spell slots,

00:54:43.197 --> 00:54:45.697
one more constitution saving throw from everybody.

00:54:46.587 --> 00:54:48.707
LAURA: I'm scared of all my dice right now.

00:54:48.707 --> 00:54:50.170
MARISHA: Oof.
SAM: Oof.

00:54:51.596 --> 00:54:52.567
TALIESIN: (unhappy noise)

00:54:52.567 --> 00:54:54.720
MARISHA: Oh no, lots of bad noises.

00:54:57.027 --> 00:54:58.357
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.
TRAVIS: 14.

00:54:58.357 --> 00:55:00.106
MATT: 14, you're fine.

00:55:00.106 --> 00:55:00.939
TRAVIS: Oof.

00:55:02.037 --> 00:55:03.217
LAURA: 12.

00:55:03.217 --> 00:55:05.107
MATT: 12, you just barely make it.

00:55:05.107 --> 00:55:06.615
LAURA: Oh my god!

00:55:06.615 --> 00:55:07.854
MATT: It was a DC of 12.

00:55:07.854 --> 00:55:09.210
LIAM: 14.
MATT: 14, you're fine.

00:55:10.737 --> 00:55:11.737
SAM: Seven.
MATT: Seven,

00:55:11.737 --> 00:55:13.577
another point of exhaustion.

00:55:13.577 --> 00:55:15.887
ASHLEY: 25.
MATT: You're fine.

00:55:15.887 --> 00:55:18.147
TALIESIN: Six.
MATT: Point of exhaustion.

00:55:18.147 --> 00:55:19.819
MARISHA: Nine.
MATT: Point of exhaustion.

00:55:19.819 --> 00:55:21.667
TRAVIS: (retching)

00:55:21.667 --> 00:55:23.077
MATT: Your bodies are locking up

00:55:23.077 --> 00:55:24.517
and some of you are beginning to--

00:55:24.517 --> 00:55:26.000
you feel your head beginning to want to sleep

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:29.867
you feel your head beginning to want to sleep

00:55:29.867 --> 00:55:33.427
and being this cold and the sensation of wanting to sleep

00:55:33.427 --> 00:55:35.374
is a bad combination.

00:55:35.374 --> 00:55:38.617
TRAVIS and LIAM: (laugh)

00:55:38.617 --> 00:55:40.627
MATT: The snow begins to let up a little bit

00:55:41.547 --> 00:55:42.707
but it's still cold and windy

00:55:42.707 --> 00:55:44.187
and the further you begin to climb

00:55:44.187 --> 00:55:46.527
along the base of this mountain range,

00:55:46.527 --> 00:55:48.027
the wind does buffet you a bit

00:55:48.027 --> 00:55:49.927
and the eagles are having to fight

00:55:49.927 --> 00:55:51.837
a little bit to keep together.

00:55:51.837 --> 00:55:53.190
The entire group as one.

00:55:54.387 --> 00:55:57.880
But you do begin to climb and climb and climb.

00:55:58.797 --> 00:56:00.907
And I believe the person with the final ability

00:56:00.907 --> 00:56:03.457
to hold out is you, am I correct?

00:56:03.457 --> 00:56:06.224
LAURA: No, he'll be an eagle longer than I will.

00:56:06.224 --> 00:56:07.057
MATT: That's what I'm saying.

00:56:07.057 --> 00:56:08.527
You're the last person--

00:56:08.527 --> 00:56:09.397
Sorry, you're the person

00:56:09.397 --> 00:56:13.120
who has the last bit to give before you stop.

00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:13.953
LAURA: Yeah.

00:56:13.953 --> 00:56:16.103
MATT: And you sense in the final moments there,

00:56:16.957 --> 00:56:19.247
your spell about to fade and you desperately seek

00:56:19.247 --> 00:56:21.787
for some sort of safer ground to land.

00:56:21.787 --> 00:56:23.567
If you could roll a perception check for me

00:56:23.567 --> 00:56:24.530
with disadvantage.

00:56:24.530 --> 00:56:25.857
LAURA: With disadvantage.

00:56:25.857 --> 00:56:27.137
MATT: But you have an advantage because you're an eagle,

00:56:27.137 --> 00:56:28.772
so it would be just a single roll.

00:56:28.772 --> 00:56:30.475
TRAVIS: Maybe outside the cake.

00:56:30.475 --> 00:56:32.247
LAURA: I did, I did, I rolled my last one

00:56:32.247 --> 00:56:33.547
outside of the cake, okay?

00:56:34.467 --> 00:56:36.057
SAM: It's just superstition, guys,

00:56:36.057 --> 00:56:37.867
that has nothing to do with it.

00:56:38.717 --> 00:56:41.883
LAURA: Oh god, I thought that was a 20, but it's so not.

00:56:44.011 --> 00:56:45.400
LIAM: (like Gollum) What is it?

00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:48.143
LAURA: Hold on. What do I add to it?

00:56:48.143 --> 00:56:50.219
MATT: You add your wisdom modifier of eagle form.

00:56:50.219 --> 00:56:51.745
LAURA: 10.

00:56:51.745 --> 00:56:53.386
MATT: Okay, you find--

00:56:53.386 --> 00:56:54.937
LAURA: Did you guide me?

00:56:54.937 --> 00:56:56.245
TALIESIN: I didn't know what you were doing.

00:56:56.245 --> 00:56:58.867
(laughter)

00:56:58.867 --> 00:57:00.997
MATT: So you guys watch as Jester's eagle form

00:57:00.997 --> 00:57:03.767
begins to dart down towards

00:57:03.767 --> 00:57:06.087
some portion of the mountain range

00:57:06.087 --> 00:57:08.100
and instinctually you follow.

00:57:09.307 --> 00:57:11.237
TALIESIN: Does it look good to me?

00:57:11.237 --> 00:57:12.807
MATT: It seems sudden.

00:57:12.807 --> 00:57:14.512
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:57:14.512 --> 00:57:15.471
MATT: You go ahead and dart down

00:57:15.471 --> 00:57:17.897
and find a pocket of the mountain

00:57:17.897 --> 00:57:20.127
where you can see enough snow has built up

00:57:20.127 --> 00:57:23.907
to where it's not just jagged rock that pushes past the ice.

00:57:23.907 --> 00:57:26.397
And with that, you land and your form drops

00:57:26.397 --> 00:57:28.867
and the payload of the rest of your group

00:57:28.867 --> 00:57:31.280
that you were carrying also hits the soft snow.

00:57:33.177 --> 00:57:34.310
TALIESIN: Perception check.

00:57:35.287 --> 00:57:37.246
I am so nervous about everything right now.

00:57:37.246 --> 00:57:39.417
Does this a fuck up level two exhaustion?

00:57:39.417 --> 00:57:41.358
It's been so long since I've been level two exhausted.

00:57:41.358 --> 00:57:42.387
MATT: Yeah, you have disadvantage on it.

00:57:42.387 --> 00:57:44.022
TALIESIN: I have disadvantage on this, but anything else

00:57:44.022 --> 00:57:45.377
that I have to worry about right now?
MATT: Your speed is halved.

00:57:45.377 --> 00:57:46.577
TALIESIN: Speed is halved, okay.

00:57:49.917 --> 00:57:52.317
That didn't go that badly.

00:57:52.317 --> 00:57:53.990
20.

00:57:53.990 --> 00:57:55.442
MATT: 20.

00:57:55.442 --> 00:57:59.457
This area you're on is thin

00:57:59.457 --> 00:58:01.267
and looking, as soon as you all land,

00:58:01.267 --> 00:58:03.337
you can see just to be on the peripheral

00:58:03.337 --> 00:58:05.563
about 10 feet one direction and 15 feet the other

00:58:05.563 --> 00:58:06.817
it just drops off.

00:58:06.817 --> 00:58:09.077
You're not sure how stark that drop is

00:58:09.077 --> 00:58:11.165
just from where you're currently standing.

00:58:11.165 --> 00:58:15.777
But you have about a 15- to 20-foot ridge here

00:58:15.777 --> 00:58:18.567
before the mountain cliff continues to face upward.

00:58:18.567 --> 00:58:19.977
And behind you, there's a slight spike

00:58:19.977 --> 00:58:22.207
and then it drops off from where you guys were approaching.

00:58:22.207 --> 00:58:24.647
But you can touch a semblance

00:58:24.647 --> 00:58:26.567
of harder packed ground beneath you,

00:58:26.567 --> 00:58:28.967
whether that's just compressed snow into ice

00:58:28.967 --> 00:58:31.217
or if it's actual dirt, you're uncertain.

00:58:31.217 --> 00:58:33.079
SAM: This is good, they can't get us here.

00:58:33.079 --> 00:58:35.847
LAURA: Is this a bad place? You're still an eagle, right?

00:58:37.067 --> 00:58:39.054
Do you see somewhere that's better than this?

00:58:39.054 --> 00:58:40.197
TALIESIN: Let's be quiet.

00:58:40.197 --> 00:58:41.867
We've got like 10 more minutes of eagle.

00:58:41.867 --> 00:58:42.717
LAURA: Of Caleb.

00:58:42.717 --> 00:58:44.997
TALIESIN: Let's see if Caleb can
find something a little higher,

00:58:44.997 --> 00:58:46.518
and if he can, he can come grab us.

00:58:46.518 --> 00:58:48.647
LIAM: I was actually 40 minutes ahead of Jester.

00:58:48.647 --> 00:58:50.947
MATT: Yeah, so you have another 40 minutes.

00:58:50.947 --> 00:58:54.437
LIAM: He'll just leave his cargo and I will go up

00:58:54.437 --> 00:58:55.917
and try to find something wider.

00:58:55.917 --> 00:58:58.037
He's also looking for something where he can

00:58:58.037 --> 00:59:00.857
dash down the gem without losing it,

00:59:00.857 --> 00:59:02.237
ping-ponging down the mountain side.

00:59:02.237 --> 00:59:05.377
So he wants a better place for his friends

00:59:05.377 --> 00:59:07.087
and more room to work.

00:59:07.087 --> 00:59:09.647
MATT: Okay, make a perception check for me.

00:59:09.647 --> 00:59:11.087
LIAM: Still snowy as hell, yes?

00:59:11.087 --> 00:59:12.585
MATT: Yep.
LIAM: Okay, so straight roll.

00:59:12.585 --> 00:59:13.957
MATT: It's a little lessened, but it's still enough

00:59:13.957 --> 00:59:15.979
to where it's going to obscure your vision.

00:59:15.979 --> 00:59:18.867
LIAM: 15.
MATT: 15, okay.

00:59:18.867 --> 00:59:21.347
You climb for about 10, 12 or so minutes

00:59:21.347 --> 00:59:23.477
and you find one space that's a little more open.

00:59:23.477 --> 00:59:26.467
It's like a bowl arrangement within the side,

00:59:26.467 --> 00:59:28.247
like a little jutting platform

00:59:28.247 --> 00:59:30.387
that arcs into this bowl shape

00:59:30.387 --> 00:59:32.017
that's filled with snow.

00:59:32.017 --> 00:59:34.627
You're not sure what the depth would be,

00:59:34.627 --> 00:59:36.137
or if it is a safe space,

00:59:36.137 --> 00:59:38.747
but it looks like it has a broader area to work with

00:59:38.747 --> 00:59:40.767
before it begins to descend on the two slopes

00:59:40.767 --> 00:59:44.427
that carry down to a heavy descent into the valley below.

00:59:44.427 --> 00:59:45.627
LIAM: Bowl of snow.
MATT: Yeah.

00:59:46.561 --> 00:59:48.985
LIAM: (heavy exhale)

00:59:50.737 --> 00:59:51.777
LIAM: I could ferry people.

00:59:51.777 --> 00:59:52.610
LAURA: Yeah.

00:59:54.537 --> 00:59:56.817
LIAM: Yeah, I'm going to just beeline back

00:59:56.817 --> 01:00:01.157
and start taking people two at a time to that place.

01:00:01.157 --> 01:00:02.797
TRAVIS: And you left us down there when you dropped off.

01:00:02.797 --> 01:00:06.007
Yeah, I will say to Beau first, because she be loud:

01:00:06.007 --> 01:00:09.417
(whispering) Stay quiet, because avalanches are a bitch.

01:00:09.417 --> 01:00:11.167
TALIESIN: (whispering) I've got an idea.
TRAVIS: (whispering) Okay.

01:00:11.167 --> 01:00:13.968
MARISHA: I just hide my bottle rockets.

01:00:13.968 --> 01:00:15.377
(laughter)

01:00:15.377 --> 01:00:16.827
MATT: She was ready to celebrate.

01:00:17.767 --> 01:00:19.577
TALIESIN: I'm whispering, this is why I'm being loud,

01:00:19.577 --> 01:00:21.097
but I want to be heard.

01:00:21.097 --> 01:00:23.273
We could bury the stone here--
SAM: Whisper!

01:00:23.273 --> 01:00:24.757
LAURA: No!
SAM: Whisper, what are you--

01:00:24.757 --> 01:00:26.467
TALIESIN: -- and come back for it in the morning.

01:00:26.467 --> 01:00:29.127
That way if they are looking for it, they won't find us

01:00:29.127 --> 01:00:30.727
and they won't know where it is.

01:00:31.907 --> 01:00:35.057
SAM: You mean like bury the stone somewhere where we're not.

01:00:35.057 --> 01:00:36.627
TALIESIN: Here.
SAM: Yeah.

01:00:36.627 --> 01:00:38.697
TALIESIN: Till we come back to get it tomorrow morning.

01:00:38.697 --> 01:00:40.447
MATT: That, in theory, would work

01:00:40.447 --> 01:00:42.347
because they can see the stone,

01:00:42.347 --> 01:00:44.877
but if it's in snow, they won't know where.

01:00:44.877 --> 01:00:46.357
Unless they use Locate Object.

01:00:46.357 --> 01:00:48.967
TALIESIN: And even then it'll be--
SAM: Super hard to get.

01:00:48.967 --> 01:00:50.707
TALIESIN: And not where we are.

01:00:50.707 --> 01:00:51.897
TRAVIS: Right, and they know where we are.

01:00:51.897 --> 01:00:54.437
and if they find us, we won't have it.

01:00:54.437 --> 01:00:55.777
LAURA: Okay.

01:00:55.777 --> 01:00:57.317
TALIESIN: Come back for it in the morning.

01:00:57.317 --> 01:00:59.597
LAURA: Caleb will remember this location.

01:00:59.597 --> 01:01:00.447
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:01:00.447 --> 01:01:02.487
SAM: But he's not Caleb right now;

01:01:02.487 --> 01:01:05.570
he doesn't remember things as well.

01:01:07.287 --> 01:01:08.397
TALIESIN: He'll remember this.

01:01:08.397 --> 01:01:09.962
SAM: Oh, you know what?

01:01:09.962 --> 01:01:12.330
I'm going to take out a button and put it down,

01:01:13.807 --> 01:01:17.237
so I'll recognize this spot if we come by it again.

01:01:17.237 --> 01:01:18.887
LAURA: I mean, I guess we have Locate Object.

01:01:18.887 --> 01:01:20.827
We'll know, generally.

01:01:20.827 --> 01:01:22.737
TALIESIN: Locate Object only works when you're--

01:01:22.737 --> 01:01:24.147
LAURA: Within 1,000 feet.

01:01:24.147 --> 01:01:25.737
TALIESIN: I think it's a good plan.

01:01:25.737 --> 01:01:26.787
LAURA: Okay.

01:01:26.787 --> 01:01:28.266
MARISHA: X marks the spot.

01:01:28.266 --> 01:01:30.727
TRAVIS: That better be a fucking magic button.

01:01:30.727 --> 01:01:33.507
ASHLEY: How high up are we on this mountain?

01:01:33.507 --> 01:01:35.077
MATT: You're not certain.

01:01:35.077 --> 01:01:37.207
You've had very limited visibility

01:01:37.207 --> 01:01:38.982
and just going along with where the eagles are taking you.

01:01:38.982 --> 01:01:41.187
LAURA: I don't think it's smart to leave it out.

01:01:41.187 --> 01:01:43.027
I just...

01:01:43.027 --> 01:01:45.117
TALIESIN: It's not like they can't just take it from us

01:01:45.117 --> 01:01:46.090
if they find us.

01:01:47.097 --> 01:01:48.387
SAM: We can bury it.

01:01:48.387 --> 01:01:50.047
TALIESIN: This way, at least.

01:01:50.047 --> 01:01:51.777
TRAVIS: That is the end chess move, right?

01:01:51.777 --> 01:01:54.027
If they get to the stone and we are there,

01:01:54.027 --> 01:01:55.667
they will kill us.

01:01:55.667 --> 01:01:58.287
Or it'll be a fight and people will die.

01:01:58.287 --> 01:02:00.487
At least if they get the stone, we have time to rest

01:02:00.487 --> 01:02:01.920
and fight another day.

01:02:01.920 --> 01:02:03.497
SAM: Before bedtime,

01:02:03.497 --> 01:02:05.077
Caleb might be able to come back here

01:02:05.077 --> 01:02:08.047
and put his strand of thread around it or something.

01:02:08.047 --> 01:02:09.272
TALIESIN: I don't think we should.

01:02:09.272 --> 01:02:11.967
I think we should just leave it be,

01:02:11.967 --> 01:02:12.800
I think we just leave it be.

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:14.027
TRAVIS: They could see that magic, yeah.

01:02:14.027 --> 01:02:15.707
TALIESIN: That magic will glow.

01:02:15.707 --> 01:02:17.697
ASHLEY: We could also try to destroy it.

01:02:17.697 --> 01:02:18.937
TALIESIN: Tomorrow.
ASHLEY: Tomorrow?

01:02:18.937 --> 01:02:20.007
TALIESIN: There's not enough of us

01:02:20.007 --> 01:02:22.687
and if we make noise, they're going to find us.

01:02:22.687 --> 01:02:25.457
TRAVIS: Caleb did say he wanted to try and...

01:02:25.457 --> 01:02:27.277
But barring that.

01:02:27.277 --> 01:02:29.847
TALIESIN: I think that's a beacon.

01:02:29.847 --> 01:02:32.447
TRAVIS: Might be, unless it glows.

01:02:32.447 --> 01:02:33.767
TALIESIN: I say bury it.

01:02:33.767 --> 01:02:35.007
I'm going to start burying it

01:02:35.007 --> 01:02:37.307
just because I'm cold and cranky.

01:02:37.307 --> 01:02:38.467
MATT: Okay.

01:02:38.467 --> 01:02:39.833
TALIESIN: Until someone tells me not to.

01:02:39.833 --> 01:02:41.787
TRAVIS: We'll wait until Caleb drops out of--

01:02:41.787 --> 01:02:43.117
he did explicitly say--

01:02:43.117 --> 01:02:44.577
LIAM: Well, this is a conversation that you guys were having

01:02:44.577 --> 01:02:46.771
while he was making his first run.

01:02:46.771 --> 01:02:47.604
MATT: Correct.

01:02:47.604 --> 01:02:49.484
Around this time, Caleb returns in eagle form

01:02:49.484 --> 01:02:51.507
and begins grabbing and ferrying people

01:02:51.507 --> 01:02:52.730
to a higher platform.

01:02:54.277 --> 01:02:56.897
As I'm going to take you for a second

01:02:56.897 --> 01:02:59.007
and explain to you what I'm planning to do with the stone,

01:02:59.007 --> 01:03:01.205
which you can understand because I speak eagle.

01:03:01.205 --> 01:03:03.290
LIAM: (cawing) Hurry it up.

01:03:03.290 --> 01:03:05.411
TRAVIS: You do, that's right. They can understand you.

01:03:05.411 --> 01:03:06.257
TALIESIN: I'm going to just do this

01:03:06.257 --> 01:03:08.019
unless you really have a problem with it,

01:03:08.019 --> 01:03:09.547
I think this is the best course of action,

01:03:09.547 --> 01:03:10.847
we can try again tomorrow.

01:03:12.327 --> 01:03:14.118
LIAM: He screeches--
LAURA: Screeches quietly.

01:03:14.118 --> 01:03:17.543
LIAM: -- and it's, "WTF, mate,"

01:03:17.543 --> 01:03:21.687
and then he grabs Yasha and Veth and flies off.

01:03:21.687 --> 01:03:22.817
MATT: Okay.

01:03:22.817 --> 01:03:26.140
MARISHA: I'm standing behind with Caduceus.

01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:29.376
LAURA: I'm going to cast Cure Wounds on you, Beau.

01:03:29.376 --> 01:03:30.700
Just while I'm standing next to you,

01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:32.460
I'm just going to reach over and pat your back.

01:03:34.147 --> 01:03:34.980
MARISHA: Thank you.

01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:36.547
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:03:36.547 --> 01:03:37.397
That feels nice.

01:03:37.397 --> 01:03:38.477
TALIESIN: Is this a crazy idea?

01:03:38.477 --> 01:03:41.307
MAIRSHA: No, I don't think it's crazy.

01:03:41.307 --> 01:03:43.647
I'm a little lost right now.

01:03:43.647 --> 01:03:45.177
TALIESIN: I'm really cold.

01:03:45.177 --> 01:03:46.737
MARISHA: It's hard to tell what's a good idea

01:03:46.737 --> 01:03:48.507
and what's a bad idea right now.

01:03:48.507 --> 01:03:49.877
TALIESIN: I think we'd bring the bag with us

01:03:49.877 --> 01:03:51.330
or keep the bag here as well?

01:03:52.917 --> 01:03:54.267
The bag of weird stuff.

01:03:54.267 --> 01:03:55.827
TRAVIS: Oh, I'd get rid of the fucking bag.

01:03:55.827 --> 01:03:58.867
LAURA: 17 points, Beau.

01:03:58.867 --> 01:03:59.742
MATT: Make sure there's nothing else in it.

01:03:59.742 --> 01:04:01.063
ASHLEY: See what else is in the bag.

01:04:01.063 --> 01:04:01.896
TRAVIS: We haven't looked.

01:04:01.896 --> 01:04:04.607
MARISHA: Yeah, what's in the bag?
LIAM: What's in the bag?

01:04:04.607 --> 01:04:06.707
LAURA: We should look in the bag while we're waiting.

01:04:06.707 --> 01:04:08.499
MARISHA: Okay.
LAURA: Let's look in the bag while Caleb's

01:04:08.499 --> 01:04:09.889
flying the other people up.
TALIESIN: Just in case it's something dangerous.

01:04:09.889 --> 01:04:11.525
TRAVIS: Turn it upside-down and shake it.

01:04:11.525 --> 01:04:13.227
LAURA: Try to get as much out of it as we can.

01:04:13.227 --> 01:04:16.477
MATT: Okay, as you turn the bag under,

01:04:16.477 --> 01:04:17.894
you shake it out a bit

01:04:17.894 --> 01:04:20.957
and you see the giant stone, of course, falls out

01:04:20.957 --> 01:04:22.287
and it's about this big around.

01:04:22.287 --> 01:04:23.617
LAURA: Jesus, it's a big stone.

01:04:23.617 --> 01:04:24.840
MATT: Yeah, it's heavy.

01:04:26.337 --> 01:04:30.107
Out of it you can see come a section of rope,

01:04:30.107 --> 01:04:32.487
some climbing tools, general materials,

01:04:32.487 --> 01:04:37.437
and four of these somewhat

01:04:39.745 --> 01:04:41.486
pyramid-like smaller shapes,

01:04:41.486 --> 01:04:45.657
these odd devices, similar to the one you found earlier

01:04:45.657 --> 01:04:46.827
in one of the ruins.

01:04:46.827 --> 01:04:47.784
TRAVIS: Intuit.

01:04:47.784 --> 01:04:51.342
SAM: Oh, four of them?
TRAVIS: Those bad fucking mamajamas.

01:04:51.342 --> 01:04:53.497
SAM: Why don't we set some of those?

01:04:53.497 --> 01:04:55.057
LAURA: We can set it here.
TRAVIS: Yes!

01:04:55.057 --> 01:04:56.297
SAM: Around the rock.

01:04:56.297 --> 01:04:58.617
TRAVIS: Yeah, I mean, I'll wait till the eagle comes back,

01:04:58.617 --> 01:05:00.998
but fuck yes, we lay a trap.

01:05:00.998 --> 01:05:02.247
SAM: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Fuck yes.

01:05:02.247 --> 01:05:04.177
Five perimeter charges.

01:05:04.177 --> 01:05:05.397
SAM: Not just perimeter charges.

01:05:05.397 --> 01:05:08.777
If it's on like a large rock,

01:05:08.777 --> 01:05:10.567
we could set them around the rock and just...

01:05:10.567 --> 01:05:11.400
MARISHA: Blast the whole thing off.

01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:14.310
TRAVIS: The area surface is like 300 feet radial.

01:05:15.757 --> 01:05:17.020
LIAM: It's psychic damage.

01:05:17.897 --> 01:05:19.620
TRAVIS: But times five.
SAM: Well, still.

01:05:19.620 --> 01:05:21.177
LIAM: It would be really deadly to them, though,

01:05:21.177 --> 01:05:22.357
if five of them go off at one time.

01:05:22.357 --> 01:05:24.837
MARISHA: Except for Lucien, who's immune to psychic.

01:05:24.837 --> 01:05:26.498
TRAVIS: That's okay, I'd rather face one than five.

01:05:26.498 --> 01:05:29.074
MARISHA: He is immune to psychic.
LIAM: We don't know about the Tomb Takers.

01:05:29.074 --> 01:05:29.907
TRAVIS: Yeah, we don't know about that.

01:05:29.907 --> 01:05:32.697
I would assume it's not the same for them.

01:05:32.697 --> 01:05:33.584
MARISHA: Yeah, it's probably not the same for them.

01:05:33.584 --> 01:05:35.583
SAM: It's still good, it's still a good call.

01:05:35.583 --> 01:05:37.206
LAURA: And we can turn it off when we get it back,

01:05:37.206 --> 01:05:39.067
and if anything happens we can pick it back up?

01:05:39.067 --> 01:05:40.167
TRAVIS: You pie chart that shit,

01:05:40.167 --> 01:05:41.977
so that you get a little bit of overflow

01:05:41.977 --> 01:05:43.237
from all of the five.

01:05:43.237 --> 01:05:45.737
LAURA: We can pick them back up if they don't go off?

01:05:45.737 --> 01:05:46.570
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:05:46.570 --> 01:05:47.648
SAM: I don't know about that.

01:05:47.648 --> 01:05:48.587
TRAVIS: You can.

01:05:48.587 --> 01:05:49.457
SAM: Yeah?

01:05:49.457 --> 01:05:51.227
MARISHA: We did it before, I think.

01:05:51.227 --> 01:05:52.890
TRAVIS: We didn't.

01:05:52.890 --> 01:05:53.847
MARISHA: We haven't?

01:05:53.847 --> 01:05:55.509
Oh, what if we set at the top of the--

01:05:55.509 --> 01:05:57.047
TRAVIS: You can put the pin back in essentially.

01:05:57.047 --> 01:05:58.897
MARISHA: When we were going down? Okay.

01:05:58.897 --> 01:05:59.987
TRAVIS: You activate it mentally,

01:05:59.987 --> 01:06:02.483
or if somebody comes within range of it.
LAURA: He used a Guardian.

01:06:02.483 --> 01:06:04.333
MARISHA: Oh, okay.
TALIESIN: It was a Guardian.

01:06:05.987 --> 01:06:08.977
Just for shits and giggles, now I'm going to--

01:06:08.977 --> 01:06:10.049
No, never mind, I'm going to wait.

01:06:10.049 --> 01:06:11.730
LAURA: Are they magical charges?

01:06:13.831 --> 01:06:14.664
TRAVIS: I think so.

01:06:14.664 --> 01:06:17.097
LAURA: All Lucian has to do is look at it

01:06:17.097 --> 01:06:19.130
and they'll all be disabled.

01:06:21.977 --> 01:06:23.087
TRAVIS: That's a good point.

01:06:23.087 --> 01:06:26.217
MARISHA: I have a feeling that from what I've--

01:06:26.217 --> 01:06:28.991
Okay, DM.
MATT: Mm-hmm?

01:06:30.237 --> 01:06:32.027
MARISHA: Because I want to be fair about this.

01:06:32.027 --> 01:06:36.447
From what Beau has seen and seeing the pulses of eyes

01:06:37.567 --> 01:06:39.727
when he does certain magic

01:06:39.727 --> 01:06:43.577
and seeing how it'll move around.

01:06:43.577 --> 01:06:46.567
Does Beau have any insight into

01:06:46.567 --> 01:06:48.547
if he would be able to do that all the time

01:06:48.547 --> 01:06:51.427
or could she deduce if she thinks

01:06:51.427 --> 01:06:52.537
that that's an activation?

01:06:52.537 --> 01:06:54.557
MATT: At your proximity and maybe

01:06:54.557 --> 01:06:56.987
Caduceus' passive perception as well

01:06:56.987 --> 01:07:00.117
and Caleb during that final encounter, it's an odd--

01:07:00.117 --> 01:07:02.357
and now that you have a moment to think about it,

01:07:02.357 --> 01:07:04.097
there's an odd nightmarish element

01:07:04.097 --> 01:07:08.317
to Lucian's physical eyes.

01:07:08.317 --> 01:07:12.367
When that one would flash in the conical space

01:07:12.367 --> 01:07:16.787
of magic was dissipated and left inert.

01:07:16.787 --> 01:07:20.164
When he turned, the eye that it originated from

01:07:20.164 --> 01:07:21.387
(fleshy bubbling)

01:07:21.387 --> 01:07:25.527
slid across the body to maintain its position

01:07:25.527 --> 01:07:27.772
where it was originally set before it, then

01:07:27.772 --> 01:07:30.540
(whoosh) shifted back a short time after.

01:07:31.409 --> 01:07:33.090
TRAVIS: Cool. That's great.

01:07:33.090 --> 01:07:34.799
LAURA: What the fu--

01:07:34.799 --> 01:07:35.799
TRAVIS: It's cool.

01:07:39.123 --> 01:07:42.546
LAURA: What the hell, Matt?
MATT: Caleb's returned--

01:07:42.546 --> 01:07:44.250
Caleb's returned to grab the next group.

01:07:44.250 --> 01:07:45.977
TRAVIS: When we dumped out all this stuff,

01:07:45.977 --> 01:07:48.637
the rope, the four intuit charges,

01:07:48.637 --> 01:07:50.097
I'm just going to feel around for anything

01:07:50.097 --> 01:07:51.737
that's fucking invisible.

01:07:51.737 --> 01:07:53.147
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:07:53.147 --> 01:07:54.637
TALIESIN: Detect Magic.

01:07:54.637 --> 01:07:56.537
TRAVIS: That would probably help-- natural 20!

01:07:57.561 --> 01:07:59.207
For a total of, I don't know.

01:07:59.207 --> 01:08:00.794
MATT: Not bad.

01:08:00.794 --> 01:08:02.037
You feel pretty confident

01:08:02.037 --> 01:08:03.437
that you do not see anything hidden.

01:08:03.437 --> 01:08:06.327
That the contents of the bag that you have

01:08:06.327 --> 01:08:07.197
are all that's there.

01:08:07.197 --> 01:08:09.827
What you do ascertain from this is this bag

01:08:09.827 --> 01:08:11.777
wouldn't be a catch-all bag.

01:08:11.777 --> 01:08:15.427
This bag was largely and had to be fitted

01:08:15.427 --> 01:08:19.717
for the size of this particular stone.

01:08:19.717 --> 01:08:21.547
They would have had probably multiples of these

01:08:21.547 --> 01:08:23.437
if they were going to collect others.

01:08:23.437 --> 01:08:24.447
So, you gather this--

01:08:24.447 --> 01:08:27.550
you don't have all of their materials, but you have some.

01:08:28.917 --> 01:08:31.177
And magical, the stone itself

01:08:31.177 --> 01:08:33.427
gives a very, very strong magical essence.

01:08:33.427 --> 01:08:36.227
It's almost like blinding at this proximity.

01:08:36.227 --> 01:08:38.907
And then the intuit charges as well

01:08:38.907 --> 01:08:40.987
give off a pretty strong magical essence,

01:08:40.987 --> 01:08:41.927
but nothing about the tools.

01:08:41.927 --> 01:08:45.637
TALIESIN: I say we just leave one of
the charges next to the stone

01:08:45.637 --> 01:08:47.342
buried as best we can and hope

01:08:47.342 --> 01:08:49.507
that the magical essence blinds.

01:08:49.507 --> 01:08:51.022
TRAVIS: Yeah, takes over the glow of the other one.

01:08:51.022 --> 01:08:52.217
TALIESIN: Let's keep three.

01:08:52.217 --> 01:08:53.597
TRAVIS: Maybe, like, right under it?

01:08:53.597 --> 01:08:54.430
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:08:55.854 --> 01:08:57.037
LIAM: There's also a trick to arming them.

01:08:57.037 --> 01:08:58.697
They take one minute to arm

01:08:58.697 --> 01:09:00.437
and then you have one minute to get away from it.

01:09:00.437 --> 01:09:03.767
So, not one person can't arm and arm another,

01:09:03.767 --> 01:09:06.106
and arm another.
TALIESIN: We're just going to do one.

01:09:06.106 --> 01:09:08.037
LAURA: And put it right underneath the stone?

01:09:08.037 --> 01:09:09.097
TALIESIN: Right underneath the stone.

01:09:09.097 --> 01:09:10.805
TRAVIS: Could do two.

01:09:10.805 --> 01:09:13.550
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm not against doing more than one.

01:09:14.637 --> 01:09:17.317
Because once again, we can just undo them,

01:09:17.317 --> 01:09:18.578
if they don't go.

01:09:18.578 --> 01:09:20.417
TRAVIS: We could do like three if they're all together

01:09:20.417 --> 01:09:21.447
under that big ass rock.

01:09:21.447 --> 01:09:23.147
I think you still get the same,

01:09:23.147 --> 01:09:24.769
you only see the glow.

01:09:24.769 --> 01:09:27.307
TALIESIN: I'm testing that theory right now.

01:09:27.307 --> 01:09:28.947
How blinding is this?

01:09:28.947 --> 01:09:32.617
How hard is it to see if I smoosh them together?

01:09:32.617 --> 01:09:34.107
MATT: Close up you can see the distance,

01:09:34.107 --> 01:09:36.537
standing back about, you can only really get back

01:09:36.537 --> 01:09:38.727
about 15 or so feet before you get uncomfortably close

01:09:38.727 --> 01:09:39.820
to any of the edges.

01:09:40.985 --> 01:09:42.667
And it begins to blend a little bit.

01:09:42.667 --> 01:09:43.877
TALIESIN: I think it's a good plan.

01:09:43.877 --> 01:09:46.457
ASHLEY: When we get the stone in the morning,

01:09:46.457 --> 01:09:49.787
that'll-- it won't go off?

01:09:49.787 --> 01:09:50.620
SAM: It will.

01:09:52.387 --> 01:09:55.167
ASHLEY: Or are we just leaving it?
TRAVIS: When we get to, I think it--

01:09:55.167 --> 01:09:56.097
SAM: It will go off.

01:09:56.097 --> 01:09:57.327
TRAVIS: Yeah, it will.

01:09:57.327 --> 01:09:58.537
Well, we can turn it off.

01:09:58.537 --> 01:10:01.237
SAM: No, you can set the conditions
for it to explode, correct?

01:10:01.237 --> 01:10:03.966
MATT: You can set the conditions to explode.

01:10:03.966 --> 01:10:05.777
It either detonates when you tell it

01:10:05.777 --> 01:10:07.277
as the person who sets it.

01:10:07.277 --> 01:10:09.660
It's like a mental link--
LIAM: You have to have eyes on it.

01:10:09.660 --> 01:10:10.676
MATT: -- or proximity.

01:10:10.676 --> 01:10:12.747
If it's set to proximity,

01:10:12.747 --> 01:10:15.107
then there's no way to disable it

01:10:15.107 --> 01:10:16.465
other than it detonating.

01:10:16.465 --> 01:10:19.180
LAURA: Oh, then I don't think we should do that.

01:10:20.397 --> 01:10:22.137
TRAVIS: That's different.

01:10:22.137 --> 01:10:25.203
LIAM: They're also hard to arm.
TRAVIS: Are they?

01:10:25.203 --> 01:10:27.787
LIAM: It's not everybody can do it guaranteed.

01:10:27.787 --> 01:10:29.535
It's a very high arcana check.

01:10:29.535 --> 01:10:30.977
TRAVIS: Oh, balls.
LAURA: Well then, no.

01:10:30.977 --> 01:10:32.487
SAM: We could leave them.

01:10:32.487 --> 01:10:35.203
We could leave one armed with a mental fuse,

01:10:35.203 --> 01:10:38.519
We could leave one armed with a mental fuse,

01:10:38.519 --> 01:10:40.587
like you have to think about it to set it off

01:10:40.587 --> 01:10:43.420
and then also leave the--
MARISHA: Yeah, the Alarm?

01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:44.983
SAM: The Alarm around it.
LIAM: It'll have to be one of you two.

01:10:44.983 --> 01:10:48.937
I can't do it because I'm an eagle, I can't do it.

01:10:48.937 --> 01:10:51.037
TALIESIN: We're all-- our ability checks suck right now.

01:10:51.037 --> 01:10:51.870
We're going to fuck it up.

01:10:51.870 --> 01:10:53.717
SAM: I can do it.
TALIESIN: I can't feel my fingers.

01:10:53.717 --> 01:10:55.347
SAM: I've got magic fingers.

01:10:55.347 --> 01:10:57.637
TRAVIS: If we get the rest-- if the original plan

01:10:57.637 --> 01:11:00.827
was to take the rest and just get rid of the stone.

01:11:00.827 --> 01:11:02.517
Teleport the stone away.

01:11:02.517 --> 01:11:05.187
Because then it sends them three days,

01:11:05.187 --> 01:11:07.297
if there weren't mountains between Aeor

01:11:07.297 --> 01:11:09.947
and whatever that A4 dot is.

01:11:09.947 --> 01:11:11.067
But there are mountains there.

01:11:11.067 --> 01:11:13.277
TALIESIN: So, let's just leave it here overnight.

01:11:13.277 --> 01:11:15.257
Let's not do any tricky traps.

01:11:15.257 --> 01:11:16.997
Let's just bury it and then come back

01:11:16.997 --> 01:11:17.871
to get it in the morning

01:11:17.871 --> 01:11:19.747
and just know that this giant magical beacon

01:11:19.747 --> 01:11:21.517
isn't giving away our position.

01:11:21.517 --> 01:11:22.547
TRAVIS: Pray to fuck they don't find it.

01:11:22.547 --> 01:11:25.544
TALIESIN: So I'm just going to
finish putting the snow over it.

01:11:25.544 --> 01:11:27.200
And as soon as Caleb comes back

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:28.957
we'll just bed down for the fucking night.

01:11:28.957 --> 01:11:30.277
MATT: Okay, you put it beneath

01:11:30.277 --> 01:11:32.207
about a foot and a half to two feet of snow

01:11:32.207 --> 01:11:34.574
and you'll hope that it's enough.

01:11:34.574 --> 01:11:35.967
One by one, you carry the rest of the group

01:11:35.967 --> 01:11:38.107
to the upper precipice that you located earlier

01:11:38.107 --> 01:11:40.407
and you all find yourselves in a more comfortable space

01:11:40.407 --> 01:11:42.987
than the one that you originally found.

01:11:42.987 --> 01:11:44.277
It does, towards the center of it,

01:11:44.277 --> 01:11:46.587
get to about six, seven feet deep

01:11:46.587 --> 01:11:49.047
of relatively soft snow at the top

01:11:49.047 --> 01:11:50.610
to packed ice below.

01:11:51.977 --> 01:11:53.517
So if you want to move to the center,

01:11:53.517 --> 01:11:55.007
you're going to have to melt some materials there

01:11:55.007 --> 01:11:56.547
or you can camp a little further out

01:11:56.547 --> 01:11:57.997
from where that bowl is on the ledge.

01:11:57.997 --> 01:12:01.657
LIAM: I could probably spend five, 10, 15 minutes

01:12:01.657 --> 01:12:03.927
melting snow just with fire in my hands.

01:12:03.927 --> 01:12:06.377
MATT: Okay, it will cause light.
TRAVIS: It is light.

01:12:06.377 --> 01:12:08.220
I have Destroy Water.

01:12:09.131 --> 01:12:11.067
LAURA: Oh!
MARISHA: That's cool.

01:12:11.067 --> 01:12:14.057
TRAVIS: It's my last 1st-level spell without a rest.

01:12:14.057 --> 01:12:16.867
But it's only a 30-foot cube

01:12:16.867 --> 01:12:19.071
MATT: 30-foot cube. Well, you can give it a shot.

01:12:19.071 --> 01:12:20.167
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll do that.

01:12:20.167 --> 01:12:21.362
MARISHA: The dome is also 30-foot right?

01:12:21.362 --> 01:12:23.647
MATT: You watch as a section in the center

01:12:23.647 --> 01:12:26.057
of the bowl of that platform suddenly is hollowed out.

01:12:26.057 --> 01:12:28.707
There is a region there of ice and snow

01:12:28.707 --> 01:12:31.167
that is now just an open space.

01:12:31.167 --> 01:12:35.377
It's more than enough, ample space for the hut.

01:12:35.377 --> 01:12:37.495
SAM: Are we doing the hut, the dome?

01:12:37.495 --> 01:12:39.487
TALIESIN: And then I'm going to help bury it in the snow.

01:12:39.487 --> 01:12:41.967
TRAVIS: Sorry, for clarification, it's 10 gallons of water

01:12:41.967 --> 01:12:44.877
that I can destroy or 30-foot cube of fog.

01:12:44.877 --> 01:12:47.255
So, probably a little less.
MATT: Got it.

01:12:47.255 --> 01:12:48.140
TRAVIS: Just to be fair.

01:12:48.140 --> 01:12:51.537
MATT: That's way less, but you can carve out a small space.

01:12:53.067 --> 01:12:54.087
Good clarification, though.

01:12:54.087 --> 01:12:55.634
TALIESIN: We'll keep moving snow.

01:12:55.634 --> 01:12:57.675
MARISHA and ASHLEY: Yeah.
MARISHA: We'll bury it and be good.

01:12:57.675 --> 01:13:01.537
LAURA: I'm cold resistant, so I'll help to dig.

01:13:01.537 --> 01:13:03.351
MATT: Fair enough.

01:13:03.351 --> 01:13:04.184
For the sake of brevity,

01:13:04.184 --> 01:13:08.347
you eventually build a sizable functional camping space

01:13:08.347 --> 01:13:10.807
for a night of not the most comfortable rest,

01:13:10.807 --> 01:13:12.437
but functional rest.

01:13:12.437 --> 01:13:14.057
You take the time to build your hut?

01:13:14.057 --> 01:13:14.890
LIAM: Yeah.

01:13:14.890 --> 01:13:16.667
As a ritual and it's warm inside.

01:13:16.667 --> 01:13:17.707
MATT: Yep.

01:13:17.707 --> 01:13:20.022
TALIESIN: And I'm going to literally,

01:13:20.022 --> 01:13:22.347
just going to be snow on the top.

01:13:22.347 --> 01:13:25.124
We're vanishing the damn-- I assume it's white.

01:13:25.124 --> 01:13:27.090
MATT: Well, he can change the color.

01:13:27.090 --> 01:13:29.347
SAM: It's yellow now!

01:13:29.347 --> 01:13:31.027
TALIESIN: It's going to be...

01:13:31.027 --> 01:13:33.747
MATT: So you all eventually curl up inside

01:13:33.747 --> 01:13:34.937
the interior of the dome.

01:13:34.937 --> 01:13:37.037
A much desired reprieve

01:13:37.037 --> 01:13:38.627
from the freezing temperatures of the night

01:13:38.627 --> 01:13:40.717
that have been stalking you the entirety of this trip

01:13:40.717 --> 01:13:42.650
once you left the tower.

01:13:44.077 --> 01:13:47.327
And you begin to find yourselves trying to sleep.

01:13:47.327 --> 01:13:48.857
Anyone taking watch?

01:13:48.857 --> 01:13:50.067
SAM: I'll take first watch.

01:13:50.067 --> 01:13:50.900
MATT: All right.

01:13:50.900 --> 01:13:52.337
TRAVIS: I need the short rest at least.

01:13:52.337 --> 01:13:53.637
MATT: Perception check for me.

01:13:54.517 --> 01:13:55.897
LAURA: I'm going to give them Guidance.

01:13:55.897 --> 01:13:58.881
I'm going to give you Guidance before I go to sleep.

01:13:58.881 --> 01:14:00.314
SAM: What does that mean?
MATT: Guidance lasts a minute.

01:14:00.314 --> 01:14:01.380
This is a watch over the whole thing.

01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:02.737
It would not work for this.
LAURA: Just kidding!

01:14:02.737 --> 01:14:05.220
MATT: What was that?
TRAVIS: Can I activate a short rest?

01:14:05.220 --> 01:14:07.062
MATT: You will, yeah.

01:14:07.062 --> 01:14:08.467
SAM: Eight.
MARISHA: Can I do that, too?

01:14:08.467 --> 01:14:10.014
MATT: Seems pretty solid.
LIAM: 23.

01:14:10.014 --> 01:14:11.577
MATT: Yeah, you take a short rest.

01:14:11.577 --> 01:14:12.410
Okay.

01:14:13.311 --> 01:14:14.557
TRAVIS: I'm going to recover some hit dice.

01:14:14.557 --> 01:14:18.359
MATT: Okay, the snow lessens progressively
throughout the night,

01:14:18.359 --> 01:14:20.157
which bodes well for journeying

01:14:20.157 --> 01:14:24.177
and bodes for any sort of traversing

01:14:24.177 --> 01:14:26.147
of Eiselcross in general.

01:14:26.147 --> 01:14:30.177
That does not bode well for guarding and covering tracks,

01:14:30.177 --> 01:14:32.267
but we'll see if that continues.

01:14:32.267 --> 01:14:33.307
But you finish your first watch.

01:14:33.307 --> 01:14:35.057
Who's taking second?

01:14:35.057 --> 01:14:36.127
MARISHA: I'll take second.

01:14:36.127 --> 01:14:37.152
MATT: All righty.

01:14:39.148 --> 01:14:40.448
Roll perception.

01:14:42.074 --> 01:14:43.219
With disadvantage.

01:14:43.219 --> 01:14:46.307
MARISHA: With disadvantage, that was an 18.

01:14:46.307 --> 01:14:48.837
Let's see how much more terribly I do.

01:14:48.837 --> 01:14:53.187
Much more terribly, eight total.

01:14:53.187 --> 01:14:54.387
MATT: Keeping the best look you can,

01:14:54.387 --> 01:14:56.194
but you're all really tired

01:14:56.194 --> 01:14:57.857
and on the edge of frostbitten

01:14:58.717 --> 01:15:00.569
and you're starting to nod off as you--

01:15:00.569 --> 01:15:03.987
MARISHA: In between. I'm trying to stay up.

01:15:03.987 --> 01:15:06.967
MATT: And then, final watch?

01:15:06.967 --> 01:15:08.655
ASHLEY: I'll take it, I'll take it.

01:15:08.655 --> 01:15:11.297
MATT: Okay, Yasha, perception check with disadvantage.

01:15:11.297 --> 01:15:13.797
LAURA: I said it, too, so I was waking up.

01:15:13.797 --> 01:15:14.780
MATT: Okay, Jester as well.

01:15:14.780 --> 01:15:17.727
MARISHA: Beau just subconsciously falls over

01:15:17.727 --> 01:15:20.337
and lands her head on Yasha's shoulder--

01:15:20.337 --> 01:15:22.043
ASHLEY: I give her some pats.
MARISHA: -- in her sleep.

01:15:23.197 --> 01:15:24.030
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:15:25.869 --> 01:15:26.786
Roll again.

01:15:28.454 --> 01:15:29.962
LAURA: 13.

01:15:29.962 --> 01:15:31.120
MATT: Okay.

01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:31.986
ASHLEY: 16.

01:15:31.986 --> 01:15:33.453
MATT: 16, okay.

01:15:34.458 --> 01:15:36.167
TRAVIS: I heal 62.

01:15:36.167 --> 01:15:38.067
MATT: It's tough when you've gotten used to the tower.

01:15:38.067 --> 01:15:40.687
A lot of this long, hard day's journey

01:15:40.687 --> 01:15:42.817
through the frozen nightmarish landscape,

01:15:42.817 --> 01:15:46.952
this far north to find yourself in a comfortable warm bed.

01:15:48.857 --> 01:15:50.987
But nothing catches your attention

01:15:50.987 --> 01:15:52.537
up on the side of the mountain.

01:15:54.177 --> 01:15:56.394
Eventually, towards the end of your watch,

01:15:56.394 --> 01:15:58.487
light begins to finally break through.

01:15:58.487 --> 01:16:00.937
The cloud cover remains, but it's not as dense.

01:16:00.937 --> 01:16:03.307
The storm seems to have mostly passed.

01:16:03.307 --> 01:16:05.167
And just a very, very light snow

01:16:05.167 --> 01:16:07.687
is now falling across the mountainside.

01:16:07.687 --> 01:16:11.047
You can see now the slight shift to gray

01:16:11.047 --> 01:16:13.767
to lighter gray, to eventually the vision

01:16:13.767 --> 01:16:17.180
of just the endless white escape out below.

01:16:17.180 --> 01:16:19.447
The soft snow has covered everything to sight

01:16:19.447 --> 01:16:21.777
and it's odd, it's like standing in the middle

01:16:21.777 --> 01:16:22.610
of a white cyc.

01:16:22.610 --> 01:16:24.437
It's just, you see the edge of the mountain

01:16:24.437 --> 01:16:28.667
and then below it's just white and then above faint gray.

01:16:28.667 --> 01:16:32.260
It's a little discombobulating, but oddly beautiful.

01:16:33.967 --> 01:16:35.097
But you all come to consciousness.

01:16:35.097 --> 01:16:36.697
You can complete your long rest.

01:16:37.917 --> 01:16:39.877
MARISHA: We also have a point of exhaustion, right?

01:16:39.877 --> 01:16:41.607
MATT: Yes, although the long rest should get rid

01:16:41.607 --> 01:16:42.677
of one point of exhaustion.

01:16:42.677 --> 01:16:44.547
MARISHA: Recovers one point, right?

01:16:44.547 --> 01:16:45.380
MATT: It should.

01:16:45.380 --> 01:16:46.667
Keep tabs on that on your own.

01:16:46.667 --> 01:16:48.107
MARISHA: Okay.
LIAM: I'm even stevens

01:16:48.107 --> 01:16:50.457
because we had that tea.

01:16:50.457 --> 01:16:52.777
MARISHA: We had the tea. The tea saved our ass.

01:16:52.777 --> 01:16:54.567
MATT: Correct, but remember any points that you gained

01:16:54.567 --> 01:16:57.237
while you were in creature form would not carry over.

01:16:57.237 --> 01:17:00.455
LAURA: Yeah, so I'm good to go now, too.

01:17:01.787 --> 01:17:04.625
MATT: So the dome drops and the warm comfort

01:17:04.625 --> 01:17:06.777
of the interior is immediately met

01:17:06.777 --> 01:17:08.687
with the harsh cold morning.

01:17:08.687 --> 01:17:10.362
Not as cold in the deepest parts of the night

01:17:10.362 --> 01:17:12.367
in which you were pushing against the elements,

01:17:12.367 --> 01:17:14.800
but cold enough to waken you,

01:17:15.637 --> 01:17:17.667
and once again, set in the reality

01:17:17.667 --> 01:17:21.027
of where you are and what has happened.

01:17:21.027 --> 01:17:22.135
What do you do?

01:17:22.135 --> 01:17:25.568
LAURA: I'm going to immediately
cast Locate Object on that--

01:17:27.102 --> 01:17:28.551
TALIESIN: Are we close enough to--

01:17:28.551 --> 01:17:29.887
LAURA: Within 1,000 feet, I'm assuming

01:17:29.887 --> 01:17:32.607
we're within 1,000 feet of it. How far away were we?

01:17:32.607 --> 01:17:34.167
I would know.

01:17:34.167 --> 01:17:36.554
MATT: I'd you're maybe about 600, 700 feet from it.

01:17:36.554 --> 01:17:38.667
LAURA: So I'm going to cast it and see

01:17:38.667 --> 01:17:42.400
if I can sense it around us.

01:17:44.947 --> 01:17:47.397
MATT: You finish casting your spell and concentrate.

01:17:49.085 --> 01:17:52.997
You close your eyes and you feel the thread of the Traveler

01:17:52.997 --> 01:17:54.414
reach through you.

01:17:57.120 --> 01:17:59.887
(bong) There it is. You sense it on the ledge below.

01:18:01.340 --> 01:18:02.198
MARISHA: I hate it.

01:18:03.472 --> 01:18:04.951
TRAVIS: The taint smear.

01:18:04.951 --> 01:18:06.126
MARISHA: I know.

01:18:06.126 --> 01:18:07.076
Goddamn it.

01:18:07.076 --> 01:18:09.148
TRAVIS: Fucking track mark.

01:18:09.148 --> 01:18:11.148
ASHLEY: We all just go silent.

01:18:12.514 --> 01:18:14.347
MATT: Every time it adds about three or four weeks

01:18:14.347 --> 01:18:15.180
to my lifespan, guys.

01:18:15.180 --> 01:18:16.447
So, I'm just...

01:18:16.447 --> 01:18:18.147
MARISHA: And removes about three to four from ours.

01:18:18.147 --> 01:18:20.370
MATT: I am the Colin Robinson of this troupe.

01:18:20.370 --> 01:18:22.217
I just eat the energy.

01:18:22.217 --> 01:18:26.407
SAM: You're 68 years old and you just look amazing.

01:18:26.407 --> 01:18:27.253
LAURA: I'm going to grab Caleb.

01:18:27.253 --> 01:18:29.407
MATT: I've been his apprentice for awhile.

01:18:29.407 --> 01:18:31.207
LAURA: I'm going to grab Caleb and pull his head up

01:18:31.207 --> 01:18:32.540
and out of the--

01:18:32.540 --> 01:18:33.947
Oh wait, the dome is done?

01:18:33.947 --> 01:18:35.577
LIAM: Well, it will be, if you pulled my head up and out.

01:18:35.577 --> 01:18:37.407
LAURA: You can get your head out, and keep your body in.

01:18:37.407 --> 01:18:38.817
LIAM: I don't think so.

01:18:38.817 --> 01:18:41.297
MATT: To get your long rest

01:18:41.297 --> 01:18:43.738
because the dome lasts for eight hours, correct?

01:18:43.738 --> 01:18:45.777
And you took a watch and then say,

01:18:45.777 --> 01:18:47.787
give it about six full hours of rest to get your long rest.

01:18:47.787 --> 01:18:48.620
By the time you'd wake up

01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:51.277
the dome would vanish that moment, so.

01:18:51.277 --> 01:18:53.957
TALIESIN: But anyone who didn't wake up.

01:18:53.957 --> 01:18:55.657
Anyone who didn't take a--

01:18:55.657 --> 01:18:56.490
Oh yeah, no, never mind.

01:18:56.490 --> 01:19:00.537
MATT: Yeah, the last watch, which was Jester and Yasha,

01:19:00.537 --> 01:19:02.557
you both would have completed your long rest

01:19:02.557 --> 01:19:04.001
before the watch finished.

01:19:04.001 --> 01:19:04.834
LAURA: Great.

01:19:06.134 --> 01:19:07.424
Caleb, Caleb, Caleb.

01:19:07.424 --> 01:19:08.704
And I'm going to point.

01:19:08.704 --> 01:19:12.874
I'm going to, like, stand directly behind him

01:19:12.874 --> 01:19:16.837
and point my finger to the dot where the orb is.

01:19:18.094 --> 01:19:19.254
LIAM: Yeah.
LAURA: That's where it is.

01:19:19.254 --> 01:19:20.649
Don't forget that spot, okay?

01:19:20.649 --> 01:19:21.984
LIAM: Okay.
LAURA: You see where I'm pointing?

01:19:21.984 --> 01:19:24.161
LIAM: Yeah, your arm's over my shoulder pointing like that.

01:19:24.161 --> 01:19:24.994
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: I'm looking down.

01:19:24.994 --> 01:19:26.466
Yeah, okay. I have it.
LAURA: Look down at my finger.

01:19:26.466 --> 01:19:28.132
That's where it is.
LIAM: Yeah. Right there.

01:19:28.132 --> 01:19:29.431
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: So we have options.

01:19:29.431 --> 01:19:31.031
What do we want to do?

01:19:31.031 --> 01:19:33.634
Try to destroy it, try to send it somewhere.

01:19:33.634 --> 01:19:34.704
LAURA: Try to send it.

01:19:34.704 --> 01:19:36.464
I think we should send it far away from here

01:19:36.464 --> 01:19:38.064
somewhere where they won't be able to get to it,

01:19:38.064 --> 01:19:39.327
they won't have any idea.

01:19:40.734 --> 01:19:45.034
MARISHA: Unless anyone has any
super-duper, uber magical tricks

01:19:45.034 --> 01:19:47.384
up their sleeves, I don't see anybody destroying this

01:19:47.384 --> 01:19:50.764
with the weapons that we have here.

01:19:50.764 --> 01:19:52.624
SAM: I mean, we can fly it up.

01:19:52.624 --> 01:19:53.872
Are we all awake?

01:19:53.872 --> 01:19:56.654
MARISHA: I just want to point out
that it fell out of the sky

01:19:56.654 --> 01:19:59.987
2000 years ago as an entire city collapsed.

01:20:01.260 --> 01:20:02.684
And it seems great.

01:20:02.684 --> 01:20:03.754
It seems fine.
LIAM: Well, it was encased

01:20:03.754 --> 01:20:05.073
within buildings.

01:20:05.073 --> 01:20:06.896
MARISHA: It was, I'm not--

01:20:06.896 --> 01:20:08.504
I'm not knocking it: give it a try.

01:20:08.504 --> 01:20:10.644
LIAM: Well, the only reason I'm hesitant to do it is

01:20:10.644 --> 01:20:12.834
because of what you said earlier.

01:20:12.834 --> 01:20:15.749
You got me spooked with an idea of an avalanche here.

01:20:15.749 --> 01:20:16.962
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

01:20:16.962 --> 01:20:18.312
LAURA: Oh yeah, that would suck.

01:20:20.024 --> 01:20:21.234
Why don't we just tell teleport it?

01:20:21.234 --> 01:20:24.452
We can send it to Allura.

01:20:24.452 --> 01:20:27.559
SAM: Can we do that? Can we teleport non-living things?

01:20:27.559 --> 01:20:29.434
LIAM: Mm-hmm.
MATT: You can.

01:20:29.434 --> 01:20:31.064
LAURA: We could send it to--

01:20:31.064 --> 01:20:33.602
SAM: That library in Zadash that we always go to.

01:20:33.602 --> 01:20:35.564
MATT: You can use Teleport to cast it directly.

01:20:35.564 --> 01:20:36.804
You can carry it with you

01:20:36.804 --> 01:20:38.614
while stepping onto a teleportation circle

01:20:38.614 --> 01:20:40.764
and it will probably travel with you.
TRAVIS: Now, it end up

01:20:40.764 --> 01:20:43.604
in somebody's living room because of where we are.

01:20:43.604 --> 01:20:46.454
But we get rid of that thing, we buy time.

01:20:46.454 --> 01:20:49.253
LIAM: Actually--
MATT: If you carry it with you,

01:20:49.253 --> 01:20:50.594
you'll at least travel

01:20:50.594 --> 01:20:53.584
wherever it ends up going if things get weird.

01:20:53.584 --> 01:20:54.964
If you send it as a separate teleport,

01:20:54.964 --> 01:20:56.354
you'll have no idea where it landed

01:20:56.354 --> 01:20:58.514
unless you were to follow up with any sort of scry spell.

01:20:58.514 --> 01:21:01.584
LAURA: We could teleport and then just try to get back here.

01:21:01.584 --> 01:21:03.574
LIAM: One thing we could do is try to send it to your house

01:21:03.574 --> 01:21:04.565
or to your house

01:21:04.565 --> 01:21:06.735
and then talk to the people-- well--
SAM: It's pronounced

01:21:06.735 --> 01:21:08.398
Xhorhaus.
LIAM: Xhorhaus.

01:21:08.398 --> 01:21:09.581
MARISHA: ♪ Xhorhaus ♪

01:21:09.581 --> 01:21:11.491
TRAVIS: ♪ In the middle of Xhorhaus. ♪

01:21:11.491 --> 01:21:13.334
LAURA: I'm not running the risk that--
LIAM: -- to go to Nicodranas.

01:21:13.334 --> 01:21:15.324
LAURA: I'm not running the risk that the Tomb Takers

01:21:15.324 --> 01:21:18.484
would show up and, no.

01:21:18.484 --> 01:21:19.937
SAM: My kid's right down the street.

01:21:19.937 --> 01:21:21.522
No thanks.
TRAVIS: What about the Cobalt Soul?

01:21:21.522 --> 01:21:24.156
MARISHA: I think the Cobalt Soul, to be totally honest.

01:21:24.156 --> 01:21:25.684
TALIESIN: That's the way to go.

01:21:25.684 --> 01:21:26.584
MARISHA: We could let them know.
SAM: You've been talking

01:21:26.584 --> 01:21:29.367
to the ones in Zadash or Rexxentrum?
TRAVIS: Neutral agency.

01:21:29.367 --> 01:21:31.724
MARISHA: We've been talking to Yudala Fon;

01:21:31.724 --> 01:21:34.167
they're located in Rexxentrum.

01:21:34.167 --> 01:21:37.414
Or I could also hit up any of the people we know

01:21:37.414 --> 01:21:39.536
in Zadash and get it even a little bit further away.

01:21:39.536 --> 01:21:41.274
SAM: Yeah. Maybe we don't want it in Rexxentrum.

01:21:41.274 --> 01:21:42.384
Because there's baddies there.

01:21:42.384 --> 01:21:44.075
LIAM: Yeah, that's--

01:21:44.075 --> 01:21:46.441
Are we 100% certain we're done with it, too,

01:21:46.441 --> 01:21:47.574
because where we send it is--

01:21:47.574 --> 01:21:50.634
SAM: Just devil's advocate,
we can keep it as a bargaining chip

01:21:50.634 --> 01:21:52.394
in case one of us gets nabbed or something.

01:21:52.394 --> 01:21:55.204
MARISHA: We tried that and it didn't work.

01:21:55.204 --> 01:21:57.964
LAURA: We get rid of it because, here's the thing.

01:21:57.964 --> 01:21:59.664
If it comes down to it

01:22:00.804 --> 01:22:03.664
and it means, you know, they'll kill Yasha

01:22:03.664 --> 01:22:05.244
if we don't give it back,

01:22:05.244 --> 01:22:08.684
we're going to give it back, we're going to get Yasha.

01:22:08.684 --> 01:22:11.074
And then the whole world will be destroyed.

01:22:11.074 --> 01:22:12.984
SAM: But if we don't have it,

01:22:12.984 --> 01:22:14.284
then we can't
LAURA: Then we won't have that option.

01:22:14.284 --> 01:22:17.344
SAM: But if we can't-- then Yasha dies in your scenario.

01:22:17.344 --> 01:22:18.361
LAURA: Everybody dies.
SAM: Why would you

01:22:18.361 --> 01:22:20.528
kill Yasha hypothetically?

01:22:21.784 --> 01:22:24.134
TRAVIS: When we know that they at least need three

01:22:24.134 --> 01:22:24.974
of these lodestones

01:22:24.974 --> 01:22:27.464
assuming that there's only a single one at Aeor,

01:22:27.464 --> 01:22:30.714
ours, theirs, and the one that obviously will be there.

01:22:30.714 --> 01:22:33.054
Unless the apparatus they all need is multiples

01:22:33.054 --> 01:22:34.364
and there's just more waiting.

01:22:34.364 --> 01:22:37.384
If we get rid of it, they have to go--

01:22:37.384 --> 01:22:40.674
again, not a very specific map-- at least five days,

01:22:40.674 --> 01:22:42.994
maybe a week or more away.

01:22:42.994 --> 01:22:45.224
And we can plan, maybe meet up with Essek,

01:22:45.224 --> 01:22:46.349
come up with an idea,

01:22:46.349 --> 01:22:49.107
recruit the Dynasty into this if we need to,

01:22:49.107 --> 01:22:51.464
contact the Cobalt Soul.

01:22:51.464 --> 01:22:52.857
Time is what we need.

01:22:54.114 --> 01:22:56.024
They can keep coming after us, but they won't.

01:22:56.024 --> 01:22:57.547
They <i>need</i> another stone.

01:22:59.684 --> 01:23:01.724
MARISHA: Yeah. I agree with that.

01:23:01.724 --> 01:23:02.557
SAM: Okay.

01:23:04.714 --> 01:23:07.370
MARISHA: Who's the headmaster at Zadash?

01:23:07.370 --> 01:23:10.497
MATT: Zadash would be High Curator Loman Turray.

01:23:10.497 --> 01:23:11.738
MARISHA: Loman Turray.

01:23:13.334 --> 01:23:16.827
Have I had much interactions with them?

01:23:18.274 --> 01:23:20.614
MATT: You've seen them and met them before in the past,

01:23:20.614 --> 01:23:22.724
but not in recent times.

01:23:22.724 --> 01:23:24.924
Most of your interaction has been with Zeenoth

01:23:24.924 --> 01:23:29.224
or Dairon and then Yudala Fon when you went to Rexxentrum.

01:23:29.224 --> 01:23:31.056
You know all of them, you've had interactions in the past.

01:23:31.056 --> 01:23:33.528
They know you, they know of you, you imagine.

01:23:33.528 --> 01:23:35.419
MARISHA: What was it, Torrie? Is that what you said?

01:23:35.419 --> 01:23:36.252
MATT: Turray.
MARISHA: Turray?

01:23:36.252 --> 01:23:37.882
MATT: Loman Turray.

01:23:37.882 --> 01:23:39.532
TRAVIS: Why would they only need three?

01:23:41.244 --> 01:23:43.044
LAURA: Why do you think they need three?

01:23:43.044 --> 01:23:44.554
TRAVIS: Well, they got the one from A5.

01:23:44.554 --> 01:23:47.284
We have A2. Assuming there's another one at Aeor,

01:23:47.284 --> 01:23:48.174
that would be three.

01:23:48.174 --> 01:23:49.724
MARISHA: Triangulation.

01:23:49.724 --> 01:23:51.144
LAURA: What if there's not another one at Aeor?

01:23:51.144 --> 01:23:52.652
What if they only needed two?

01:23:52.652 --> 01:23:54.284
LIAM: I thought it was that they needed two.

01:23:54.284 --> 01:23:56.734
MARISHA: I think there's something bigger at Aeor.

01:23:56.734 --> 01:23:59.274
TRAVIS: Whatever it is, they need two on their person.

01:23:59.274 --> 01:24:01.274
And A4 is a distance away

01:24:01.274 --> 01:24:03.334
and A? is double the distance.

01:24:03.334 --> 01:24:08.334
LIAM: What if the two are like
key cards and the door is there?

01:24:08.335 --> 01:24:09.568
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

01:24:09.568 --> 01:24:10.971
MARISHA: It's something like that.

01:24:12.342 --> 01:24:14.592
(laughter)

01:24:16.475 --> 01:24:18.192
MATT: So what's the plan?

01:24:18.192 --> 01:24:19.742
(laughter)
MARISHA: Lord.

01:24:19.742 --> 01:24:20.592
Jesus Christ!

01:24:20.592 --> 01:24:22.475
TRAVIS: A pound just to get a drink.

01:24:23.616 --> 01:24:25.694
MATT: How does that thing not weigh 700 pounds

01:24:25.694 --> 01:24:28.704
with the amount of paper and tape
that's put on it at this point?

01:24:28.704 --> 01:24:29.844
TALIESIN: Practically a fire hazard.

01:24:29.844 --> 01:24:31.678
TRAVIS: Small maple growing out of the front.

01:24:31.678 --> 01:24:33.255
(laughter)
ASHLEY: Wow.

01:24:33.255 --> 01:24:34.088
TALIESIN: Oh.

01:24:35.154 --> 01:24:35.987
ASHLEY: That's beautiful.

01:24:35.987 --> 01:24:37.574
LAURA: That's his elven picture.

01:24:37.574 --> 01:24:39.344
I'm a fan of that one.

01:24:39.344 --> 01:24:40.868
You did look like an elf in that picture.

01:24:40.868 --> 01:24:42.205
TALIESIN: You do.
MARISHA: It's true.

01:24:42.205 --> 01:24:43.851
MATT: I was young once.

01:24:43.851 --> 01:24:45.284
(laughter)

01:24:45.284 --> 01:24:46.117
TRAVIS: Send it.

01:24:46.117 --> 01:24:47.016
MATT: Weight of the world wasn't--

01:24:47.016 --> 01:24:48.540
TRAVIS: Let's send this fucking thing.
MATT: -- weighing on me.

01:24:48.540 --> 01:24:51.674
MARISHA: Are we sending it to Zadash, where I arguably

01:24:51.674 --> 01:24:56.614
haven't been as recently informing that branch, you know?

01:24:56.614 --> 01:24:57.972
haven't been as recently informing that branch, you know?

01:24:57.972 --> 01:25:00.024
Or we can send it to Yudala Fon,

01:25:00.024 --> 01:25:02.064
who has been actively helping us

01:25:02.064 --> 01:25:03.801
and is a little bit more aware?

01:25:03.801 --> 01:25:05.404
TALIESIN: Send it to the experts.

01:25:05.404 --> 01:25:06.237
MARISHA: Rexxentrum?

01:25:06.237 --> 01:25:07.192
TALIESIN: Send it to the experts.

01:25:07.192 --> 01:25:09.200
ASHLEY: We don't need to keep it for any reason?

01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:10.108
TALIESIN: No.
TRAVIS: What's that?

01:25:10.108 --> 01:25:12.004
ASHLEY: We don't need to keep it for any reason?

01:25:12.004 --> 01:25:15.014
TALIESIN: Only if we want to summon an evil city of eyeball.

01:25:15.014 --> 01:25:15.947
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're not trying to summon the city.

01:25:15.947 --> 01:25:17.734
LAURA: We're saying we're sending it to Rexxentrum,

01:25:17.734 --> 01:25:20.704
but it could end up in the middle of the Lucidian Ocean.

01:25:20.704 --> 01:25:22.287
MARISHA: It could, but I think we need to

01:25:22.287 --> 01:25:25.270
at least give Yudala a heads-up that it's coming,

01:25:25.270 --> 01:25:26.520
and then if it doesn't show up,

01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:27.844
then they know it's a problem.

01:25:27.844 --> 01:25:29.574
TRAVIS: Yeah. It won't end up where we're sending it.

01:25:29.574 --> 01:25:31.461
It's fine. We just want it out of here.

01:25:31.461 --> 01:25:32.574
LAURA: What if it shows up--

01:25:32.574 --> 01:25:34.474
LIAM: If we try to send it to a circle

01:25:34.474 --> 01:25:37.294
or to one of the places where I have a keepsake from

01:25:37.294 --> 01:25:40.324
it will probably arrive. Probably.

01:25:40.324 --> 01:25:41.824
If we wing it, then it's a--

01:25:41.824 --> 01:25:43.314
MARISHA: Well, I was thinking about
the circle in Rexxentrum.

01:25:43.314 --> 01:25:45.254
LIAM: I understand.
MARISHA: Yeah, okay, okay, okay.

01:25:45.254 --> 01:25:47.304
TRAVIS: What are you rolling your eyes at?

01:25:47.304 --> 01:25:50.184
LAURA: We just know nothing about the magic of this place.

01:25:50.184 --> 01:25:51.884
We say we know what's going to happen.

01:25:51.884 --> 01:25:53.884
We have no idea what's going to happen.

01:25:53.884 --> 01:25:56.024
We could say we're sending it away.

01:25:56.024 --> 01:25:59.356
And then it just teleports over to Aeor,

01:25:59.356 --> 01:26:00.280
you know what I mean?

01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:03.114
We don't know what's going to happen to it.

01:26:03.114 --> 01:26:06.217
TALIESIN: I mean, the other option is it gets carried over.

01:26:07.294 --> 01:26:09.664
LIAM: And we know wherever it goes.

01:26:09.664 --> 01:26:12.784
TALIESIN: I'll roll a die on this one.

01:26:12.784 --> 01:26:14.901
Literally, actually, yes.

01:26:14.901 --> 01:26:16.774
TRAVIS: If it does end up in the Lucidian Ocean,

01:26:16.774 --> 01:26:18.044
that's good for us.

01:26:18.044 --> 01:26:19.764
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: I agree.

01:26:19.764 --> 01:26:22.517
Anything feels better than here.

01:26:23.644 --> 01:26:24.514
TALIESIN: Burn it.
LIAM: Right.

01:26:24.514 --> 01:26:25.754
They want to stay in the area.

01:26:25.754 --> 01:26:29.154
They will go to a relatively close-by location

01:26:29.154 --> 01:26:29.987
to get another one.

01:26:29.987 --> 01:26:31.094
They're not going to go--

01:26:31.094 --> 01:26:33.974
SAM: They may have already turned and gone to A5.

01:26:33.974 --> 01:26:35.767
MARISHA: They probably have.

01:26:35.767 --> 01:26:36.764
Well.
LAURA: Well,

01:26:36.764 --> 01:26:39.374
I guess, worst case scenario, I will scry on it

01:26:39.374 --> 01:26:40.504
to see where it ends up.

01:26:40.504 --> 01:26:42.854
TRAVIS: Can you scry on one of them to see where they are?

01:26:42.854 --> 01:26:43.824
TALIESIN: Let's not poke them.

01:26:43.824 --> 01:26:47.517
LAURA: I tried that before; they are
real good at blocking me.

01:26:48.764 --> 01:26:50.998
TRAVIS: All of them? Maybe Zoran?

01:26:52.664 --> 01:26:55.004
TALIESIN: Let's wait till we've handled this.

01:26:55.004 --> 01:26:57.440
SAM: You can scry on our bag? No, you can't do that.

01:26:57.440 --> 01:27:00.104
LIAM: You want to send us somewhere totally obscure,

01:27:00.104 --> 01:27:01.714
I could send it to Rumblecusp.

01:27:02.754 --> 01:27:04.204
TALIESIN: I like putting it in the hands of someone

01:27:04.204 --> 01:27:06.774
who might be able to figure out what it is while we're busy.

01:27:06.774 --> 01:27:07.764
LIAM: Okay.

01:27:07.764 --> 01:27:09.264
TRAVIS: Do it.

01:27:09.264 --> 01:27:12.001
MARISHA: Let's message Yudala.

01:27:12.001 --> 01:27:14.194
Can we message Yudala?
LAURA: I'm going to send a message to Yudala.

01:27:14.194 --> 01:27:15.479
MATT: All right, what are you saying?

01:27:15.479 --> 01:27:18.236
TRAVIS: (sighs) Jester hates this plan.

01:27:18.236 --> 01:27:22.044
LAURA: Yudala, we're probably sending you

01:27:22.044 --> 01:27:23.857
something really important.

01:27:24.964 --> 01:27:26.602
Hope it shows up.

01:27:29.534 --> 01:27:32.425
Keep it secret, safe.

01:27:32.425 --> 01:27:34.043
(laughter)

01:27:34.043 --> 01:27:35.343
Shit!

01:27:35.343 --> 01:27:36.409
TRAVIS: You got 10 more.

01:27:36.409 --> 01:27:39.087
LAURA: I could have said keep it safe, shit.

01:27:39.087 --> 01:27:40.521
TALIESIN: I could have said keep it safe, shit.

01:27:40.521 --> 01:27:41.954
LAURA: I fumbled, fucking balls.

01:27:41.954 --> 01:27:43.182
TALIESIN: And out.
TRAVIS: That's it.

01:27:43.182 --> 01:27:46.684
(laughter)

01:27:46.684 --> 01:27:47.734
MATT: That's all of them.

01:27:48.646 --> 01:27:49.662
LAURA: Goddamn it.

01:27:49.662 --> 01:27:51.874
(laughter)

01:27:51.874 --> 01:27:54.687
MATT: The response comes through from Yudala Fon.

01:27:54.687 --> 01:27:56.937
(laughter)

01:27:57.984 --> 01:28:01.826
"Do not to worry. Your message was still received."

01:28:01.826 --> 01:28:03.074
(laughter)

01:28:03.074 --> 01:28:04.739
MARISHA: She thinks we lost service.

01:28:04.739 --> 01:28:07.335
(laughter)

01:28:07.335 --> 01:28:09.288
TRAVIS: Fucking disconnected, fucking bitch.

01:28:09.288 --> 01:28:10.954
MARISHA: Don't worry, we got it.
TALIESIN: You're breaking up.

01:28:10.954 --> 01:28:12.484
SAM: I can hear you.

01:28:12.484 --> 01:28:13.725
I can hear you.

01:28:13.725 --> 01:28:15.975
I-- ugh. Forget it.
(laughter)

01:28:18.094 --> 01:28:19.637
MATT: "We will keep an eye out.

01:28:20.484 --> 01:28:23.304
"Thank you for the heads-up."

01:28:24.727 --> 01:28:27.905
TALIESIN: I am looking around again because I'm paranoid.

01:28:27.905 --> 01:28:29.444
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:28:29.444 --> 01:28:30.277
LAURA: Someday.

01:28:30.277 --> 01:28:32.194
TALIESIN: 16.
MATT: 16.

01:28:33.074 --> 01:28:34.404
Nothing catches your eye once again.

01:28:34.404 --> 01:28:36.104
It does help in the morning light

01:28:36.104 --> 01:28:38.564
that is a white scape around you.

01:28:38.564 --> 01:28:40.774
So any variation in color would be probably

01:28:40.774 --> 01:28:43.221
little easy to see, and the moment, you do not see anything.

01:28:43.221 --> 01:28:44.544
TALIESIN: Right. I'm going to keep--

01:28:47.564 --> 01:28:49.984
not all the time, but, you know, every now and then.

01:28:49.984 --> 01:28:51.328
MATT: Okay.

01:28:51.328 --> 01:28:52.828
MARISHA: All right.

01:28:54.079 --> 01:28:56.414
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Let's do this.

01:28:56.414 --> 01:28:59.934
LIAM: So we're going back down to where it was.

01:28:59.934 --> 01:29:01.474
Yeah, we're going to send it from there.

01:29:01.474 --> 01:29:05.714
So I will use just my transmutater's ability

01:29:05.714 --> 01:29:07.644
to become an eagle, not use a spell slot,

01:29:07.644 --> 01:29:10.174
and ferry the group there.

01:29:10.174 --> 01:29:11.007
MATT: Okay.

01:29:12.234 --> 01:29:15.664
LIAM: Then I will look for a spare loose stone on the ground

01:29:16.514 --> 01:29:18.373
on this little peak where we've buried it.

01:29:18.373 --> 01:29:19.704
And I will keep that.

01:29:19.704 --> 01:29:20.884
MATT: All right.

01:29:20.884 --> 01:29:21.717
SAM: There's a button.

01:29:21.717 --> 01:29:22.804
MATT: Make an investigation check for me.

01:29:22.804 --> 01:29:23.637
LIAM: Okay.

01:29:24.634 --> 01:29:26.984
MARISHA: A native button to this mountain range

01:29:26.984 --> 01:29:27.817
(laughter)

01:29:27.817 --> 01:29:29.258
LIAM: 25.
MATT: 25.

01:29:29.258 --> 01:29:30.424
You-- it takes a little bit of time

01:29:30.424 --> 01:29:31.847
and your fingers get a little numb in the process

01:29:31.847 --> 01:29:33.384
but you do manage to cobble a stone

01:29:33.384 --> 01:29:36.564
from underneath the mass amounts of ice and snow.

01:29:36.564 --> 01:29:38.874
LIAM: Okay. I fold it up in a bit of parchment

01:29:38.874 --> 01:29:41.064
and write a description of our location

01:29:41.064 --> 01:29:43.694
and I add it to a little pouch where I have a turtle,

01:29:43.694 --> 01:29:46.434
some underwear from Veth, et cetera.

01:29:46.434 --> 01:29:47.267
Then--

01:29:47.267 --> 01:29:51.134
TRAVIS: (laughs)

01:29:51.134 --> 01:29:53.066
SAM: Can I swap those out, actually?

01:29:53.066 --> 01:29:54.531
TRAVIS: Your ingredients are <i>what</i>?

01:29:54.531 --> 01:29:55.364
(laughter)

01:29:55.364 --> 01:29:57.225
No one else? Okay.
(laughter)

01:29:57.225 --> 01:29:58.766
LAURA: Veth gave it to him long time ago.

01:29:58.766 --> 01:30:00.254
TRAVIS: I'm still--

01:30:00.254 --> 01:30:03.637
LIAM: These are the key to getting into Veth's bedroom.

01:30:03.637 --> 01:30:04.803
(laughter)

01:30:04.803 --> 01:30:08.681
TRAVIS: A turtle and Veth's underpants.

01:30:08.681 --> 01:30:10.814
LIAM: And with some help from my friends

01:30:10.814 --> 01:30:13.484
we will get the massive stone out

01:30:13.484 --> 01:30:16.584
in the center of this little cliff face that we are on.

01:30:16.584 --> 01:30:17.854
And I will take the time

01:30:17.854 --> 01:30:20.834
to draw a chalk circle actually around it.

01:30:20.834 --> 01:30:22.634
I'm not going to burn a higher slot.

01:30:22.634 --> 01:30:23.784
I'll use a fifth level.

01:30:25.184 --> 01:30:26.224
We sure?

01:30:26.224 --> 01:30:27.057
We good?

01:30:27.057 --> 01:30:27.890
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:30:27.890 --> 01:30:28.723
LIAM: They got the message?

01:30:28.723 --> 01:30:30.348
MARISHA: Sure, as I--
LAURA: They got the message.

01:30:30.348 --> 01:30:31.460
MARISHA: --can be.
LIAM: Okay.

01:30:31.460 --> 01:30:33.264
TRAVIS: Jester, are you good with this?

01:30:33.264 --> 01:30:35.534
LAURA: I hate this, but they don't really see an option

01:30:35.534 --> 01:30:37.508
except for all of us go with it.

01:30:37.508 --> 01:30:38.341
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:30:39.864 --> 01:30:41.781
MATT: Just so you're aware, Caleb.

01:30:41.781 --> 01:30:42.614
LIAM: Yeah.

01:30:44.704 --> 01:30:48.085
TRAVIS: The five guys with eyes
are standing over behind him.

01:30:48.085 --> 01:30:49.654
MATT: The teleportation circle allows creatures

01:30:49.654 --> 01:30:51.892
to pass through it and what they're carrying.

01:30:51.892 --> 01:30:54.484
The spell Teleport allows you to send an object.

01:30:54.484 --> 01:30:56.934
So, if you want to use the lower level one you can,

01:30:56.934 --> 01:30:59.054
but a creature would have to ferry it through.

01:30:59.054 --> 01:31:01.574
LIAM: No, no, no.
MATT: Otherwise, it would be the--

01:31:01.574 --> 01:31:02.834
the higher Teleport.
LIAM: Okay, well,

01:31:02.834 --> 01:31:05.584
Caleb's not a dummy like me, so--

01:31:07.214 --> 01:31:08.047
LIAM: Hold on.

01:31:09.384 --> 01:31:11.844
No tower tonight. Sorry, ladies.

01:31:11.844 --> 01:31:14.044
MARISHA: Just buckle it in Sprinkle.

01:31:15.484 --> 01:31:17.414
TALIESIN: What's wrong with me?

01:31:17.414 --> 01:31:20.214
LAURA: It's 80 pounds. It will just squish him.

01:31:20.214 --> 01:31:22.117
We'll just send a dead--
TRAVIS: He'll be fine.

01:31:22.117 --> 01:31:23.547
(laughter)

01:31:23.547 --> 01:31:25.344
TALIESIN: He's seen worse.

01:31:25.344 --> 01:31:29.006
MARISHA: Just a Sprinkle-wrapped gift.

01:31:29.006 --> 01:31:30.647
TRAVIS: (high-pitched voice) Let this be it.

01:31:32.334 --> 01:31:34.205
LIAM: Well--
TRAVIS: (high-pitched voice) Oh, sweet death.

01:31:34.205 --> 01:31:37.072
LIAM: Hold on a second, then.
This complicates things a bit.

01:31:37.072 --> 01:31:38.374
TALIESIN: --on the other side.

01:31:38.374 --> 01:31:41.244
LIAM: We know that the nature of this place

01:31:41.244 --> 01:31:43.174
affects teleportation.

01:31:43.174 --> 01:31:46.394
The way to get a 100% lock without these shenanigans

01:31:46.394 --> 01:31:48.204
is either a teleportation circle,

01:31:49.294 --> 01:31:53.064
which we need to go through to use, or an object.

01:31:53.064 --> 01:31:56.199
I have no object from there.

01:31:57.934 --> 01:31:58.767
See what I'm saying?

01:31:58.767 --> 01:32:01.254
So our chances of success go down.

01:32:01.254 --> 01:32:02.937
TRAVIS: No books, no papers?
LAURA: What do you have an object--

01:32:02.937 --> 01:32:05.545
ASHLEY: Wait, wait. I have--

01:32:07.227 --> 01:32:08.074
it can be anything?

01:32:08.074 --> 01:32:09.174
LIAM: Anything, yeah, if you have it.

01:32:09.174 --> 01:32:12.064
ASHLEY: I have my Rexxentrum stein with my name on it.

01:32:12.064 --> 01:32:12.897
Will that work?

01:32:12.897 --> 01:32:15.514
SAM: Does it have to be a thing from the place

01:32:15.514 --> 01:32:18.087
like the actual building that we're sending it to?

01:32:18.087 --> 01:32:19.729
MARISHA: Or the city? Yeah.

01:32:19.729 --> 01:32:21.104
LIAM: I don't know.

01:32:21.104 --> 01:32:22.354
MATT: If it's the city in general,

01:32:22.354 --> 01:32:23.764
it will arrive at the city--

01:32:23.764 --> 01:32:25.654
LIAM: Somewhere.
MATT: -- somewhere in the city.

01:32:25.654 --> 01:32:28.434
You're trying to send it directly to the library,

01:32:28.434 --> 01:32:29.424
then you need something

01:32:29.424 --> 01:32:30.684
from the library.
TRAVIS: Any books or pages

01:32:30.684 --> 01:32:32.774
out of any of those books?

01:32:32.774 --> 01:32:35.443
MARISHA: The clothes I'm wearing are from Rexxentrum.

01:32:35.443 --> 01:32:36.537
I--
SAM: From the library.

01:32:36.537 --> 01:32:39.864
MARISHA: --geared, yeah, I geared up from the-- yeah.

01:32:39.864 --> 01:32:41.272
LIAM: So it would just drop into

01:32:42.914 --> 01:32:43.997
the dorm.

01:32:45.064 --> 01:32:46.524
LAURA: Potentially.
LIAM: Or some room.

01:32:46.524 --> 01:32:48.474
MARISHA: It would still make it to the library.

01:32:48.474 --> 01:32:49.307
LIAM: Yeah.

01:32:49.307 --> 01:32:52.265
MARISHA: So, can I borrow a dagger?

01:32:52.265 --> 01:32:53.098
TRAVIS: Sun's out, abs out.

01:32:53.098 --> 01:32:55.304
SAM: Sure, I've got an extra rusty one.

01:32:55.304 --> 01:32:57.437
MARISHA: I just rip off a piece.

01:32:57.437 --> 01:32:58.741
TRAVIS: What about the nice one you have?

01:32:58.741 --> 01:33:00.566
SAM: Shut up! It's mine.

01:33:00.566 --> 01:33:03.034
TALIESIN: It's a good name for a pub, The Rusty Dagger.

01:33:03.034 --> 01:33:04.269
SAM: Get away from it.

01:33:04.269 --> 01:33:06.504
TRAVIS: (laughs)

01:33:06.504 --> 01:33:07.512
SAM: Don't touch it.
LIAM: Maybe when we all retire.

01:33:07.512 --> 01:33:08.895
TALIESIN: We should start a juice bar.
MARISHA: Feels like a place

01:33:08.895 --> 01:33:10.262
that would have drag brunch.

01:33:10.262 --> 01:33:13.314
LAURA: Can I insight check Veth to see if she's joking

01:33:13.314 --> 01:33:16.504
or if she's seriously, like, a shithead about that dagger?

01:33:16.504 --> 01:33:18.044
MATT: Sure. Go for it.

01:33:18.044 --> 01:33:20.817
LIAM: I heard The Rusty Dagger does
really good absinthe and yogurt--

01:33:20.817 --> 01:33:22.350
(laughter)

01:33:22.350 --> 01:33:23.183
- smoothies.

01:33:23.183 --> 01:33:25.868
(laughter)

01:33:25.868 --> 01:33:28.018
SAM: (disgust noises)

01:33:28.018 --> 01:33:29.644
LAURA: 22.

01:33:29.644 --> 01:33:31.619
TALIESIN: Right there.
SAM: Did you say 22?

01:33:33.344 --> 01:33:35.774
LAURA: You're not trying to deceive me right now.

01:33:35.774 --> 01:33:37.257
SAM: It's my dagger.

01:33:37.257 --> 01:33:38.573
(laughter)

01:33:38.573 --> 01:33:40.776
MATT: She really likes her dagger.

01:33:40.776 --> 01:33:43.550
LAURA: So she seemed serious about being like,

01:33:43.550 --> 01:33:44.724
"Shut up, it's mine"?

01:33:44.724 --> 01:33:46.014
MATT: I mean--
SAM: I super-duper

01:33:46.014 --> 01:33:47.894
don't know anything about this dagger.

01:33:47.894 --> 01:33:49.674
Only that I need it.

01:33:49.674 --> 01:33:54.204
MATT: Yeah. And to be fair,
it's not like there isn't a history

01:33:54.204 --> 01:33:57.724
of Veth grabbing things greedily.

01:33:57.724 --> 01:33:59.234
It's a little odd.

01:33:59.234 --> 01:34:00.444
You pick up it's a little odd.

01:34:00.444 --> 01:34:01.277
LAURA: Okay.

01:34:01.277 --> 01:34:03.690
LIAM: And who do we want to get it to again?

01:34:03.690 --> 01:34:04.884
MARISHA: Yudala Fon.
LIAM: Yudala Fon.

01:34:04.884 --> 01:34:07.044
I will also get out a little bit of molasses

01:34:07.044 --> 01:34:09.224
and stick some parchment to the side of it

01:34:09.224 --> 01:34:11.344
and say, "Care of Yudala Fon."
TRAVIS: Nice.

01:34:11.344 --> 01:34:12.361
LIAM: Right on the side of it.

01:34:12.361 --> 01:34:13.194
MATT: All righty.

01:34:13.194 --> 01:34:15.304
MARISHA: So I take a piece of the lining

01:34:15.304 --> 01:34:17.204
on the inside of my long coat

01:34:17.204 --> 01:34:20.444
and I just rip off a chunk of it and wrap it

01:34:20.444 --> 01:34:21.354
in the lining.

01:34:21.354 --> 01:34:22.441
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: A little--

01:34:22.441 --> 01:34:25.034
tie a bow over top of the letter.

01:34:25.034 --> 01:34:26.004
Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

01:34:26.004 --> 01:34:26.837
You got it.

01:34:28.154 --> 01:34:28.987
All right.

01:34:28.987 --> 01:34:30.904
LAURA: Oh god.

01:34:30.904 --> 01:34:31.737
LIAM: I take it.

01:34:31.737 --> 01:34:33.434
SAM: Should we stand back or anything?
LIAM: And keep it.

01:34:33.434 --> 01:34:34.267
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:34:34.267 --> 01:34:36.020
MARISHA: Oh.
LIAM: I need to use it.

01:34:36.020 --> 01:34:37.161
It can't go.

01:34:38.064 --> 01:34:39.984
MARISHA: That was one of my best bows.

01:34:39.984 --> 01:34:41.924
LIAM: In fact, I might've just been able to hold the side

01:34:41.924 --> 01:34:43.634
of your fabric and--

01:34:43.634 --> 01:34:45.034
MARISHA: Well, what the fuck, man?

01:34:45.034 --> 01:34:46.092
Lead with that.
LIAM: Well, you just did it.

01:34:46.092 --> 01:34:47.835
You just did it. Couldn't stop you.

01:34:47.835 --> 01:34:49.104
I can't stop you doing anything.

01:34:49.104 --> 01:34:51.748
MARISHA: You're not wrong.
LAURA: Let's just fucking go.

01:34:51.748 --> 01:34:52.581
Come on.

01:34:54.874 --> 01:34:56.295
TALIESIN: Backing up.

01:34:56.295 --> 01:34:57.128
LIAM: (whoosh)

01:34:57.128 --> 01:34:59.664
MATT: All right, as you release

01:35:00.594 --> 01:35:04.494
the spell, the arcane equations around the stone,

01:35:04.494 --> 01:35:06.642
I would like you to roll a d100 for me, please.

01:35:06.642 --> 01:35:07.967
LIAM: Yes.
TRAVIS: Let's go, fam.

01:35:07.967 --> 01:35:10.178
MARISHA: Come on.
TRAVIS: No fucking butterflies. (claps)

01:35:10.178 --> 01:35:12.864
LAURA: Oh my god, what if it
explodes and all of us go flying

01:35:12.864 --> 01:35:14.394
off the mountain right now?

01:35:14.394 --> 01:35:15.227
TRAVIS: I'm here for it.

01:35:15.227 --> 01:35:17.034
LAURA: I don't know what all these things are.

01:35:18.454 --> 01:35:20.204
LIAM: Okay, middle of the road.
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:35:20.204 --> 01:35:21.094
LAURA: Butterflies.

01:35:21.094 --> 01:35:21.954
LIAM: 53.

01:35:21.954 --> 01:35:22.944
LAURA and MARISHA: Butterflies?

01:35:22.944 --> 01:35:24.784
MATT: 53.

01:35:24.784 --> 01:35:25.776
MATT: Okay.

01:35:25.776 --> 01:35:27.653
MARISHA: ♪ Butterflies are free to fly. ♪

01:35:27.653 --> 01:35:28.842
LAURA: At least it's not a one.

01:35:28.842 --> 01:35:31.097
LIAM: ♪ I can fly twice as high ♪

01:35:31.097 --> 01:35:32.255
MARISHA: ♪ Take a look ♪

01:35:32.255 --> 01:35:34.192
TRAVIS: He's rolling something.
SAM and MARISHA: ♪ It's in a book ♪

01:35:34.192 --> 01:35:35.812
SAM: ♪ It's Mica Burton ♪

01:35:35.812 --> 01:35:37.003
(laughter)

01:35:37.003 --> 01:35:38.978
LAURA: ♪ It's Mica Burton! ♪

01:35:38.978 --> 01:35:39.950
MATT: All right.

01:35:39.950 --> 01:35:43.007
LIAM: That's actually the verbal for the spell.

01:35:43.007 --> 01:35:44.913
MARISHA: Yeah.
(laughter)

01:35:46.604 --> 01:35:49.174
MATT: Sorry. Just double checking this scenario here.

01:35:49.174 --> 01:35:51.349
SAM: Double checking. That doesn't sound right.

01:35:51.349 --> 01:35:52.357
TALIESIN: I hate all of this.

01:35:52.357 --> 01:35:55.275
LIAM: Oh, we're all newts!
TRAVIS: That's not "you all become mountain goats"?

01:35:55.275 --> 01:35:56.475
(laughter)

01:35:56.475 --> 01:35:57.583
MATT: Roll...

01:35:57.583 --> 01:35:58.714
SAM: Oh, shit.

01:35:58.714 --> 01:36:00.389
LAURA: Who roll, who roll?

01:36:00.389 --> 01:36:01.454
MATT: Roll another d10.

01:36:01.454 --> 01:36:02.737
LIAM: Yeah, d10.

01:36:02.737 --> 01:36:04.226
MARISHA: This is how we got a dragon.

01:36:04.226 --> 01:36:06.554
SAM: (laughs)

01:36:06.554 --> 01:36:07.387
LIAM: Single d10?

01:36:07.387 --> 01:36:08.583
MATT: Sorry, sorry, a--

01:36:10.104 --> 01:36:11.834
SAM: This is like a quantity role.

01:36:11.834 --> 01:36:14.287
This is how many somethings appear.

01:36:15.234 --> 01:36:17.100
MATT: No, roll a d10 and another d10.

01:36:17.100 --> 01:36:18.576
SAM: (laughs) Now I don't know what is.

01:36:18.576 --> 01:36:21.126
MATT: Correct, but separately.
MARISHA: Separately?

01:36:21.974 --> 01:36:24.124
LIAM: Oh, two. Two.

01:36:24.124 --> 01:36:25.543
TRAVIS: Or 10 and two.

01:36:25.543 --> 01:36:26.994
LAURA: Like a 10 and a two.
LIAM: Oh, yeah, 10 and two.

01:36:26.994 --> 01:36:27.984
MATT: Okay. Got it.

01:36:27.984 --> 01:36:28.817
TALIESIN: Like driving.

01:36:30.738 --> 01:36:32.396
MATT: (poof) It vanishes.

01:36:34.066 --> 01:36:35.046
The stone is gone.

01:36:35.046 --> 01:36:37.046
LIAM: (sighs)

01:36:38.154 --> 01:36:40.859
SAM: Don't you take a drink, you motherfucker.

01:36:40.859 --> 01:36:42.064
Where did it go?

01:36:42.064 --> 01:36:44.509
TRAVIS: It's not going to reappear in 12 hours, is it?

01:36:44.509 --> 01:36:45.749
10 and two?

01:36:45.749 --> 01:36:47.904
LAURA: I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to--

01:36:47.904 --> 01:36:50.879
TALIESIN: Into a realm where you cannot harm her.

01:36:51.907 --> 01:36:53.457
SAM: Detect--

01:36:53.457 --> 01:36:55.294
Locate Object--

01:36:55.294 --> 01:36:56.549
Scry on it? Scry on it!

01:36:56.549 --> 01:36:58.084
Can you scry on it?

01:36:58.084 --> 01:36:59.714
TRAVIS: Is it instantaneous?

01:36:59.714 --> 01:37:00.845
LIAM: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:37:02.094 --> 01:37:03.354
SAM: Well done, Caleb.

01:37:03.354 --> 01:37:05.754
TALIESIN: It could be literally anywhere.

01:37:05.754 --> 01:37:08.294
SAM: No, well done, you got rid of it.

01:37:08.294 --> 01:37:10.534
We're safer now for it.

01:37:10.534 --> 01:37:12.192
TRAVIS: Use that tracking number, folks.

01:37:12.192 --> 01:37:14.244
(laughter)

01:37:14.244 --> 01:37:16.994
SAM: Says it delivered-- (laughs) on time.

01:37:16.994 --> 01:37:18.444
TRAVIS: Says "front porch."

01:37:18.444 --> 01:37:21.804
TALIESIN: Might as well being shipped from the Ukraine.

01:37:21.804 --> 01:37:23.354
MATT: So what's the plan?

01:37:23.354 --> 01:37:25.184
TRAVIS: I think we're going to scry on it, maybe.

01:37:25.184 --> 01:37:27.417
MATT: You can scry on a person or a location.

01:37:27.417 --> 01:37:28.394
An object--

01:37:28.394 --> 01:37:29.844
SAM: Well, we can scry the location

01:37:29.844 --> 01:37:31.224
where it was supposed to arrive.

01:37:31.224 --> 01:37:33.484
MARISHA: Or just message Yudala again

01:37:33.484 --> 01:37:36.029
and be like, will you message when you get it?

01:37:36.029 --> 01:37:38.502
LIAM: Search the library. We believe it to be there.

01:37:38.502 --> 01:37:40.454
MARISHA: Sure, sure.
LIAM: Turn the whole place upside down.

01:37:40.454 --> 01:37:42.517
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

01:37:43.459 --> 01:37:45.890
It is not here, so it must be there?

01:37:45.890 --> 01:37:47.274
I don't know.

01:37:47.274 --> 01:37:48.364
SAM: Then we get a message back:

01:37:48.364 --> 01:37:50.637
"Oh my god, it crushed Yudala!"

01:37:50.637 --> 01:37:51.628
(laughter)

01:37:51.628 --> 01:37:54.191
LIAM: "It fused with her!"

01:37:54.191 --> 01:37:55.853
TRAVIS: "It fused."

01:37:55.853 --> 01:37:57.034
MATT: All right.

01:37:57.034 --> 01:37:58.964
LAURA: I mean, I can send a message right now

01:37:58.964 --> 01:38:01.044
or I can try to save some spells

01:38:01.044 --> 01:38:03.395
in case we run into Lucien today. (empty chuckle)

01:38:03.395 --> 01:38:05.944
LIAM: We could also wait like five minutes

01:38:05.944 --> 01:38:07.644
or 10 minutes to wait.

01:38:07.644 --> 01:38:10.174
LAURA: Maybe somebody will find it.
LIAM: For things to happen.

01:38:10.174 --> 01:38:12.254
TRAVIS: What did you roll, dude?

01:38:12.254 --> 01:38:14.337
SAM: Should we wait 12 minutes?

01:38:16.154 --> 01:38:18.231
MARISHA: 12 minutes isn't bad.

01:38:18.231 --> 01:38:19.847
TALIESIN: Since I'm sitting here.

01:38:19.847 --> 01:38:21.754
LAURA: Now where are we going, now that we don't have it?

01:38:21.754 --> 01:38:22.744
What are we doing now?

01:38:22.744 --> 01:38:24.703
SAM: Oh god, that's great question. (laughs)
TALIESIN: 18

01:38:24.703 --> 01:38:26.214
MATT: 18.
LIAM: We could just go.

01:38:27.284 --> 01:38:28.934
MATT: You do see something--

01:38:28.934 --> 01:38:30.417
TRAVIS: What?
MATT: -- towards the base of the mountain.

01:38:30.417 --> 01:38:32.604
SAM: Oh, fuck you.
MATT: Small dark shape that sticks

01:38:32.604 --> 01:38:34.594
out from against the rest of the white.

01:38:34.594 --> 01:38:36.495
MARISHA: A small dark shape?
MATT: Yeah.

01:38:36.495 --> 01:38:39.020
TALIESIN: How big?
MATT: It's hard to see at this distance.

01:38:39.020 --> 01:38:41.567
You just barely rolled high enough to see something.

01:38:41.567 --> 01:38:43.138
LAURA: Is it moving?

01:38:43.138 --> 01:38:44.334
TALIESIN: Is it moving?

01:38:45.974 --> 01:38:46.981
MATT: It's hard to tell this distance.

01:38:46.981 --> 01:38:48.314
You have to take a minute to watch it.

01:38:48.314 --> 01:38:50.924
TRAVIS: It could also be an animal.
TALIESIN: (shushing)

01:38:50.924 --> 01:38:52.100
LAURA: We all get down.

01:38:53.124 --> 01:38:54.207
MARISHA: Okay, yeah.

01:38:55.824 --> 01:38:57.490
SAM: What are we hiding--?
MARISHA: Crouch, just crouch.

01:38:57.490 --> 01:38:59.893
LIAM: (whispering) We don't know. It could be them.

01:38:59.893 --> 01:39:01.201
It could be the stone.

01:39:01.201 --> 01:39:02.657
MARISHA: It could be the stone.

01:39:02.657 --> 01:39:04.071
LIAM: I just sent it to the bottom of the mountain.

01:39:04.071 --> 01:39:06.644
MARISHA: Yeah, in which I'd be very upset.

01:39:06.644 --> 01:39:07.996
MATT: It's moving slightly.

01:39:07.996 --> 01:39:10.241
LAURA: What is it?
MARISHA, SAM, and TRAVIS: It's not the stone.

01:39:10.241 --> 01:39:11.074
TRAVIS: We're good.

01:39:11.074 --> 01:39:12.941
SAM: Unless we made a--
LIAM: I brought it to life!

01:39:12.941 --> 01:39:15.219
TRAVIS: -- snow leopard or a mountain goat,
whatever. It's fine.

01:39:15.219 --> 01:39:16.785
TALIESIN: -- at all, or is it unrecognizable?

01:39:16.785 --> 01:39:18.264
MATT: It's hard to see at this distance.

01:39:18.264 --> 01:39:20.302
You'll have to spend a moment and really focus.

01:39:20.302 --> 01:39:21.542
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm spending that moment.

01:39:21.542 --> 01:39:22.908
LAURA: I'm going to Guide him.

01:39:22.908 --> 01:39:23.912
I've seen him looking, I'm Guiding him.

01:39:23.912 --> 01:39:25.284
MATT: Yeah, like towards the base of the mountain.

01:39:25.284 --> 01:39:27.276
TALIESIN: I don't think--
MATT: Little ways off to the side.

01:39:27.276 --> 01:39:28.754
LAURA: Or you're already Guiding yourself?

01:39:28.754 --> 01:39:30.884
TRAVIS: Have we done a horizon check to see--

01:39:30.884 --> 01:39:33.004
because if we're up on this mountain top,

01:39:33.004 --> 01:39:35.494
Aeor is in the valley below.

01:39:35.494 --> 01:39:37.754
Is there any way-fucking-out-there,

01:39:37.754 --> 01:39:40.014
like obvious thing?

01:39:40.014 --> 01:39:41.356
MATT: Roll a perception check.

01:39:41.356 --> 01:39:45.051
LAURA: Can I lay down on the ground and try to figure out

01:39:45.051 --> 01:39:46.043
where Caduceus is looking and see

01:39:46.043 --> 01:39:47.794
if I can see, too?
MATT: Sure.

01:39:47.794 --> 01:39:49.624
SAM: I'm going to feel the ground for vibrations.
TRAVIS: I know it's mostly underground,

01:39:49.624 --> 01:39:52.664
but just in case there's like a thing.

01:39:52.664 --> 01:39:54.604
16.

01:39:54.604 --> 01:39:56.554
MATT: 16, okay.

01:39:56.554 --> 01:39:59.094
Looking down into the valley, you can see there are slight

01:39:59.094 --> 01:40:01.504
you know, raises and hills

01:40:01.504 --> 01:40:04.004
and shifts in the topography-- the valley goes out--

01:40:04.004 --> 01:40:06.054
But it's odd because it's such,

01:40:06.054 --> 01:40:08.422
such a bleach white color for so far that it--

01:40:08.422 --> 01:40:10.124
that distance and perspective gets weird.

01:40:10.124 --> 01:40:10.957
TRAVIS: No texture.

01:40:10.957 --> 01:40:13.054
MATT: Yeah, at some point just becomes a white

01:40:13.054 --> 01:40:15.024
and occasionally you see things breaking it

01:40:15.024 --> 01:40:16.740
and some variations in color.

01:40:16.740 --> 01:40:18.790
To the far left,

01:40:18.790 --> 01:40:22.425
you can see a slight drop, almost like,

01:40:22.425 --> 01:40:25.274
like a faint sinkhole that seems to fill

01:40:25.274 --> 01:40:28.454
this entire valley area, but you can just make it out.

01:40:28.454 --> 01:40:29.674
It's miles off.

01:40:29.674 --> 01:40:30.795
TRAVIS: The great valley.

01:40:30.795 --> 01:40:33.050
(laughter)

01:40:33.050 --> 01:40:35.194
LAURA: Great Valley.

01:40:35.194 --> 01:40:36.224
I rolled 25.

01:40:36.224 --> 01:40:37.654
MATT: 25.

01:40:37.654 --> 01:40:39.780
TALIESIN: Oh, going for another round.

01:40:41.179 --> 01:40:42.145
Hey!

01:40:43.270 --> 01:40:44.103
22.

01:40:44.103 --> 01:40:45.349
MATT: 22.
SAM: Yahtzee.

01:40:45.349 --> 01:40:46.182
LAURA: Did you Guide yourself?

01:40:46.182 --> 01:40:48.194
MATT: It's hard to make out the details.

01:40:48.194 --> 01:40:50.874
But you do see what looks to be now, a couple of shapes.

01:40:50.874 --> 01:40:52.574
You glance down and you see five shapes.

01:40:52.574 --> 01:40:54.224
LAURA: (gasps) It's them. It's them.
LIAM: No.

01:40:54.224 --> 01:40:55.492
MARISHA: That son of a bitch.

01:40:55.492 --> 01:40:56.921
SAM: Is it-- it's five?

01:40:56.921 --> 01:40:58.319
MARISHA: (whispering) Yes.
LAURA: (whispering) They're here.

01:40:58.319 --> 01:40:59.724
SAM AND ASHLEY: Fuck.

01:40:59.724 --> 01:41:01.684
TALIESIN: Are they heading towards us or they are heading--

01:41:01.684 --> 01:41:06.044
MATT: They're a little ways off to the western side.

01:41:06.044 --> 01:41:08.694
TRAVIS: High ground, below us.

01:41:08.694 --> 01:41:10.734
Lots of snow on this cliff face.

01:41:10.734 --> 01:41:13.184
MARISHA: Ooh, ooh, ooh, yes.

01:41:13.184 --> 01:41:14.559
Let's Mulan them.

01:41:15.741 --> 01:41:16.824
MATT: (rumble)

01:41:16.824 --> 01:41:19.674
You hear this explosion.

01:41:19.674 --> 01:41:20.857
And you guys watch as

01:41:20.857 --> 01:41:23.698
something gets thrown.
MARISHA: They're Mulan'ing us.

01:41:23.698 --> 01:41:25.559
SAM: They're Mulan'ing us?

01:41:25.559 --> 01:41:27.944
MARISHA: Yeah, the avalanche!
LAURA: Polymorph.

01:41:27.944 --> 01:41:29.597
SAM: I just saw it, yes. Yes.

01:41:29.597 --> 01:41:31.718
LAURA: I Polymorph--
(laughter)

01:41:31.718 --> 01:41:32.551
I Polymorph me--

01:41:32.551 --> 01:41:34.497
MATT: The hillside's coming down in an avalanche.

01:41:34.497 --> 01:41:38.362
LAURA: I Polymorph me and Yasha!
MATT: They threw an explosive and it rocked

01:41:38.362 --> 01:41:40.054
the bottom of this mountain and the snow is beginning

01:41:40.054 --> 01:41:42.439
to swoop through. What are you doing?

01:41:42.439 --> 01:41:43.884
TRAVIS: From above us?
LAURA: I Polymorph me and Yasha

01:41:43.884 --> 01:41:45.024
LAURA: And I pick up Fjord--
MATT: From below you guys.

01:41:45.024 --> 01:41:46.704
LAURA: -- and Caduceus.

01:41:46.704 --> 01:41:48.370
MARISHA: Wait, is it coming down? Is it coming down?

01:41:48.370 --> 01:41:51.571
MATT: You don't know, you just hear
the shaking and the explosion sound.

01:41:51.571 --> 01:41:52.704
SAM: Do we still have the dome up?

01:41:52.704 --> 01:41:54.845
The dome's gone.
TALIESIN: No, no, no. That was long gone.

01:41:54.845 --> 01:41:56.724
We've got two Polymorphs.

01:41:56.724 --> 01:41:58.774
LIAM: I'll go eagle and nudge my head underneath Veth,

01:41:58.774 --> 01:41:59.894
so that she's riding up top.

01:41:59.894 --> 01:42:02.074
ASHLEY: Okay, I grab Beau.

01:42:02.074 --> 01:42:03.582
LAURA: Go! We fly.

01:42:03.582 --> 01:42:04.744
ASHLEY: That's it, everybody on?

01:42:04.744 --> 01:42:07.644
MARISHA: Does it look like
the snow is starting to billow up?

01:42:07.644 --> 01:42:10.324
To where it'll give us a little bit of cover?

01:42:10.324 --> 01:42:11.157
TRAVIS: What about above us?

01:42:11.157 --> 01:42:12.874
I'll just look up at the cliff face above us.

01:42:12.874 --> 01:42:14.084
Because we're not at the top, right?

01:42:14.084 --> 01:42:15.064
MARISHA: Right.

01:42:15.064 --> 01:42:16.080
TRAVIS: Is shit coming down?

01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:18.296
LAURA: Yeah, shit's coming down on us, right?

01:42:18.296 --> 01:42:19.850
TRAVIS: Is there a cloud growing off the mountain?

01:42:19.850 --> 01:42:21.434
MATT: There is a very faint cloud beginning--

01:42:21.434 --> 01:42:23.684
TRAVIS: Yeah, we gotta go.
LAURA: Yeah, we're flying, we're flying.

01:42:23.684 --> 01:42:25.082
We're flying away.

01:42:25.082 --> 01:42:26.444
TALIESIN: Full speed.

01:42:26.444 --> 01:42:27.702
MATT: Okay.

01:42:27.702 --> 01:42:30.467
So, we have two eagles, three eagles? What's the deal?

01:42:30.467 --> 01:42:32.542
LAURA: We have two eagles, three eagles.

01:42:32.542 --> 01:42:33.525
MATT: Three eagles.

01:42:33.525 --> 01:42:35.074
LIAM: Tree eagles.
MATT: You guys carry up

01:42:35.074 --> 01:42:38.764
into the air and you watch as elements of the mountain--

01:42:38.764 --> 01:42:41.192
not a whole massive, you know

01:42:41.192 --> 01:42:42.844
the entire mountain side, but the one side

01:42:42.844 --> 01:42:45.724
where you guys were on begins to coast down.

01:42:45.724 --> 01:42:46.994
You're not sure what the source of it was.

01:42:46.994 --> 01:42:48.794
You're not sure what caused the explosion.

01:42:48.794 --> 01:42:50.917
All you know is that had you stuck around

01:42:50.917 --> 01:42:52.604
that would have been very bad.

01:42:52.604 --> 01:42:54.916
TRAVIS: I'll send three Eldritch Blasts into the side

01:42:54.916 --> 01:42:56.458
of the mountain below where we were standing,

01:42:56.458 --> 01:42:59.200
just to send the rest of it down to them as a thank you.

01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:00.183
MATT: Okay.

01:43:00.183 --> 01:43:02.583
As you all take off and you launch the Eldritch Blasts,

01:43:02.583 --> 01:43:04.016
and they do not reach at this point,

01:43:04.016 --> 01:43:06.084
because you guys have taken up
and left, away from the mountain.

01:43:06.084 --> 01:43:10.174
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, I'm going to
chuck one of the alchemicer--

01:43:10.174 --> 01:43:12.567
alchemical fire grenades?
TRAVIS: We're over 120 feet away

01:43:12.567 --> 01:43:14.421
if my Eldritch Blasts didn't hit.

01:43:14.421 --> 01:43:15.977
SAM: I'm going to drop a penny on them.

01:43:15.977 --> 01:43:17.067
(laughter)

01:43:17.067 --> 01:43:18.743
TALIESIN: Let's just move.

01:43:18.743 --> 01:43:19.576
MARISHA: Right through your skull.

01:43:19.576 --> 01:43:22.458
TALIESIN: Are we heading towards civilization?
ASHLEY: Oh wait, I'm an eagle anyway.

01:43:22.458 --> 01:43:24.569
LIAM: Boy, that'd be cool, if we killed one with a penny.

01:43:24.569 --> 01:43:26.714
TALIESIN: Heading towards civilization?

01:43:26.714 --> 01:43:28.164
LAURA: What do you mean by civilization?

01:43:28.164 --> 01:43:29.878
Like Aeor, Essek, what?

01:43:29.878 --> 01:43:30.994
MARISHA: Fuck you, Otis.
TALIESIN: Essek.

01:43:30.994 --> 01:43:33.229
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: Otis!

01:43:33.229 --> 01:43:35.392
LAURA: I assume we're heading towards Essek.

01:43:35.392 --> 01:43:36.225
TALIESIN: Full speed.
TRAVIS: I mean, like,

01:43:36.225 --> 01:43:38.664
the two options would be we could try to find

01:43:38.664 --> 01:43:41.583
that little entrance that they
were talking about at the northwest corner.

01:43:41.583 --> 01:43:44.524
See if we could identify it, and any troops
that were around to give them a heads-up,

01:43:44.524 --> 01:43:46.751
or we can go for Essek. That's kind of it.

01:43:46.751 --> 01:43:48.601
TALIESIN: I say we go, we're--

01:43:48.601 --> 01:43:51.126
what are we-- we're not up to this yet.

01:43:51.126 --> 01:43:55.185
LAURA: I think if we can get to Essek,
we at least can get protection.

01:43:55.185 --> 01:43:57.026
Like they won't be able to just ambush us.

01:43:57.026 --> 01:43:58.542
They'll have a whole--
LIAM: We won't be on our own.

01:43:58.542 --> 01:43:59.833
LAURA: --group of people.

01:44:00.908 --> 01:44:02.176
MATT: Okay.

01:44:02.176 --> 01:44:04.449
So with that--
SAM: That makes sense, yeah.

01:44:04.449 --> 01:44:07.107
MATT: You begin to make your way towards this valley

01:44:07.107 --> 01:44:11.182
in an east-southeast direction, with the intent

01:44:11.182 --> 01:44:15.207
of finding your way towards the Shadowhand, Essek Thelyss.

01:44:16.191 --> 01:44:18.415
As you can look down below and see the dark shapes

01:44:18.415 --> 01:44:20.831
vanish one by one from sight,

01:44:22.081 --> 01:44:24.347
looking towards the path.

01:44:26.323 --> 01:44:27.589
We're going to take a break.
MARISHA: (sighs)

01:44:27.589 --> 01:44:29.155
MATT: We'll be back here in a few minutes to pick up

01:44:29.155 --> 01:44:32.396
from this leg at the journey and see what happens next.

01:44:34.913 --> 01:44:37.988
Let's hope Sam finishes off his
delightful cocktail in the interim.

01:44:37.988 --> 01:44:39.929
LAURA: (dry heave)
TRAVIS: Or not.

01:44:39.929 --> 01:44:41.204
TALIESIN: Or it finishes him off.

01:44:41.204 --> 01:44:42.095
MATT: That too, yeah.

01:44:42.095 --> 01:44:44.414
But nevertheless, see you in a few minutes.

01:44:44.918 --> 01:44:45.751
Sam.

01:44:45.751 --> 01:44:46.584
Yes.

01:44:46.584 --> 01:44:49.078
Hey, before you have to rush off

01:44:49.078 --> 01:44:53.007
for your audition for "The Gangs of Newark."

01:44:53.007 --> 01:44:55.257
(laughing)

01:44:58.058 --> 01:44:59.868
That was tailored for Liam.

01:44:59.868 --> 01:45:03.068
I know, I was looking at Liam when I said it.

01:45:03.068 --> 01:45:06.251
I grew up 20 minutes from Newark, New Jersey.

01:45:09.338 --> 01:45:11.318
Oh man. I love it.

01:45:11.318 --> 01:45:13.692
You look like Daniel Day Blew-it.

01:45:13.692 --> 01:45:15.328
(laughing)

01:45:15.328 --> 01:45:16.541
Keep 'em coming.

01:45:19.928 --> 01:45:21.441
I'm Ron Burgundy?

01:45:21.441 --> 01:45:23.691
(laughing)

01:45:25.518 --> 01:45:27.018
Oh man.

01:45:27.018 --> 01:45:31.328
Sam, you've discussed this a little bit before online,

01:45:31.328 --> 01:45:36.328
but why the staunch refusal to use Halfling Luck?

01:45:36.748 --> 01:45:39.718
Is it because, you know, your respect

01:45:39.718 --> 01:45:42.688
for the natural one, or is it just funnier not to use it?

01:45:42.688 --> 01:45:43.838
What's going on there?

01:45:43.838 --> 01:45:45.738
Yes, yes, tell us, Tiny Stark.

01:45:45.738 --> 01:45:46.571
Tell us.

01:45:46.571 --> 01:45:47.518
(laughing)

01:45:47.518 --> 01:45:49.131
Tiny Stark is great!

01:45:49.982 --> 01:45:54.982
Oh man, this is great.

01:45:55.818 --> 01:45:57.898
Hey Critters, Laura Bailey here.

01:45:57.898 --> 01:46:00.281
Let's see what's up in the Critical Role shop.

01:46:02.428 --> 01:46:05.281
Oh my gosh, it's so amazing.

01:46:08.798 --> 01:46:10.891
It's so cute. I can't handle it.

01:46:14.108 --> 01:46:15.528
I mean, the Traveler always says

01:46:15.528 --> 01:46:17.861
impulse purchases are a good decision.

01:46:20.378 --> 01:46:21.828
Hey, look at these.

01:46:21.828 --> 01:46:22.878
They go on your face.

01:46:25.913 --> 01:46:28.580
The cuteness, it's overpowering.

01:46:31.258 --> 01:46:33.508
Darling, I recommend buying two.

01:46:33.508 --> 01:46:36.843
One for you, and another for you.

01:46:36.843 --> 01:46:38.176
Let's be honest.

01:46:39.878 --> 01:46:42.425
So click on over to the Critical Role shop.

01:46:42.425 --> 01:46:44.958
Don't worry, there's a few more minutes in the break.

01:46:44.958 --> 01:46:46.058
You've still got time.

01:46:52.078 --> 01:46:54.278
Like a symphony playing to an empty theater,

01:46:54.278 --> 01:46:57.688
Critical Role dines alone without its audience.

01:46:57.688 --> 01:47:01.958
Yes, that validating and most enthusiastic congregation

01:47:01.958 --> 01:47:05.498
on the other side of the fourth wall.

01:47:05.498 --> 01:47:07.908
And what is this fourth wall,

01:47:07.908 --> 01:47:10.518
separating the viewer from the creator?

01:47:10.518 --> 01:47:13.378
A portal to an often-sought point of connection

01:47:13.378 --> 01:47:16.601
or the Twitch Subscription Zone.

01:47:17.668 --> 01:47:20.328
On the rare occasion that you miss the live bacchanal

01:47:20.328 --> 01:47:24.208
boasted by the ragtag group of thespians on Thursday night,

01:47:24.208 --> 01:47:26.478
you may always view the show on demand

01:47:26.478 --> 01:47:31.168
in the shadowland known as the Twitch Subscription Zone.

01:47:31.168 --> 01:47:33.518
Picture if you will, the necessary pieces

01:47:33.518 --> 01:47:36.498
to complete a jigsaw puzzle, but it's up to you

01:47:36.498 --> 01:47:39.008
to choose how it will be solved.

01:47:39.008 --> 01:47:42.498
You could of course subscribe with your debt rectangle,

01:47:42.498 --> 01:47:45.618
but many more divergent paths lie before you.

01:47:45.618 --> 01:47:47.113
Perhaps you've found yourself in possession

01:47:47.113 --> 01:47:50.051
of an Amazon Prime account.

01:47:51.098 --> 01:47:52.708
You would then wake up to discover

01:47:52.708 --> 01:47:54.898
a free Twitch subscription each month

01:47:54.898 --> 01:47:57.108
for a channel of your choosing.

01:47:57.108 --> 01:47:59.728
But this artifact demands renewal, for you must

01:47:59.728 --> 01:48:03.401
resubscribe each month to quench its unyielding thirst.

01:48:04.358 --> 01:48:06.348
One need not walk alone.

01:48:06.348 --> 01:48:08.158
Those who have already found their way

01:48:08.158 --> 01:48:10.448
can illuminate the path for others

01:48:10.448 --> 01:48:13.251
via the Gift a Sub button on Twitch.

01:48:14.568 --> 01:48:17.378
Critical Role is humbled by your subscription

01:48:17.378 --> 01:48:18.918
and wishes to thank you from behind

01:48:18.918 --> 01:48:22.358
the thin veil of this fourth wall.

01:48:22.358 --> 01:48:25.978
We hope you enjoy our content as much as we enjoy making it.

01:48:25.978 --> 01:48:28.838
And so ends another meandering digression,

01:48:28.838 --> 01:48:32.518
a complicated parody promo down an indistinct highway

01:48:32.518 --> 01:48:36.511
to the region we call the Twitch Subscription Zone.

01:48:45.306 --> 01:48:46.889
You will subscribe.

01:48:48.258 --> 01:48:51.078
Twitch Prime subscribe.

01:48:51.078 --> 01:48:52.661
Gift subscribe.

01:48:54.586 --> 01:48:55.931
Subscribe.

02:02:05.701 --> 02:02:07.401
MATT: And welcome back.

02:02:07.401 --> 02:02:10.481
So.
(laughter)

02:02:10.481 --> 02:02:15.481
You are all coasting over this frozen valley below you,

02:02:15.538 --> 02:02:18.211
hundreds of feet off the ground,

02:02:18.211 --> 02:02:19.877
absolving yourself from

02:02:19.877 --> 02:02:24.061
the proximity of the Tomb Takers giving chase.

02:02:24.061 --> 02:02:25.841
Through the night, you kept enough distance

02:02:25.841 --> 02:02:28.061
and managed to shrug them off enough

02:02:28.061 --> 02:02:29.761
to allow yourself a long rest, but they seem

02:02:29.761 --> 02:02:32.811
to have still managed to keep somewhat of a bead on you.

02:02:32.811 --> 02:02:37.694
But you have banished the coveted stone away to somewhere.

02:02:37.694 --> 02:02:40.877
But you have banished the coveted stone away to somewhere.

02:02:42.626 --> 02:02:44.585
TRAVIS: Jesus.
TALIESIN: (snorts)

02:02:44.585 --> 02:02:46.181
TRAVIS: Dick weed.
MATT: But you continue traveling.

02:02:46.181 --> 02:02:47.722
Where are you going? Where are you heading?

02:02:47.722 --> 02:02:49.958
SAM: We were heading to Essek, correct?

02:02:49.958 --> 02:02:50.851
MARISHA: Essek.
LAURA: Yeah, that's where

02:02:50.851 --> 02:02:52.501
we're trying to get to.

02:02:52.501 --> 02:02:55.014
SAM: Just throwing this out there, as we fly.

02:02:57.205 --> 02:02:59.081
Are we going about this incorrectly?

02:02:59.081 --> 02:03:00.311
I'm just throwing it out there.

02:03:00.311 --> 02:03:01.251
TALIESIN: Probably.
SAM: I think this is a bad idea,

02:03:01.251 --> 02:03:05.831
but they've been stalking us, hunting us,

02:03:05.831 --> 02:03:08.881
chasing us down, ambushing us.

02:03:08.881 --> 02:03:11.321
Should we do the same to them?

02:03:11.321 --> 02:03:12.851
TALIESIN: No.
SAM: Track them

02:03:12.851 --> 02:03:14.491
in the dead of night.
TALIESIN: No.

02:03:14.491 --> 02:03:18.051
SAM: Spring on them when they're least expecting it.

02:03:18.051 --> 02:03:18.977
TALIESIN: No.
ASHLEY: But I think

02:03:18.977 --> 02:03:20.451
they're always expecting it.
SAM: Kill Otis.

02:03:20.451 --> 02:03:21.542
TALIESIN: Well.

02:03:21.542 --> 02:03:23.181
MARISHA: I mean, yes to kill Otis.

02:03:23.181 --> 02:03:25.834
LIAM: (eagle noise)
MARISHA: But I don't know

02:03:25.834 --> 02:03:27.639
about all the other-
SAM: Pick them off one at a time.

02:03:27.639 --> 02:03:29.191
LIAM AND LAURA: (eagle noises)

02:03:29.191 --> 02:03:30.024
ASHLEY: (eagle noise)
(laughter)

02:03:30.024 --> 02:03:30.857
SAM: Oh.

02:03:32.001 --> 02:03:32.932
No?

02:03:32.932 --> 02:03:34.141
TALIESIN: No.
TRAVIS: Oh, we're flying, right?

02:03:34.141 --> 02:03:35.761
(yells) It's a great idea, Veth!

02:03:35.761 --> 02:03:37.680
(laughter)
ASHLEY: Oh, that's right,

02:03:37.680 --> 02:03:39.645
I forgot about that. (squawks)

02:03:39.645 --> 02:03:40.790
MARISHA: (wind blowing)

02:03:40.790 --> 02:03:44.969
LIAM: (yelling) Should we stealth in?
TRAVIS: (cheeks flapping)

02:03:44.969 --> 02:03:46.985
SAM: All right, all right, we'll table it, we'll table it.

02:03:46.985 --> 02:03:47.832
(laughter)

02:03:47.832 --> 02:03:48.798
To Essek!

02:03:49.791 --> 02:03:50.754
MATT: Okay.

02:03:53.351 --> 02:03:58.351
At this distance up, it's odd, you can see this

02:03:58.796 --> 02:04:01.541
frost-covered, jagged landscape below you

02:04:01.541 --> 02:04:03.491
that fits this valley. The mountain range

02:04:03.491 --> 02:04:06.561
you can see in the distance that curves around

02:04:06.561 --> 02:04:09.941
and wraps approximately 70% of this valley

02:04:09.941 --> 02:04:12.091
before opening westward towards the rest

02:04:12.091 --> 02:04:14.351
of the Eiselcross open ice fields

02:04:14.351 --> 02:04:16.481
that you've already traversed.

02:04:16.481 --> 02:04:18.901
Below, you can see the topography's odd and strange,

02:04:18.901 --> 02:04:22.161
and I guess whoever's keeping an eye on it

02:04:22.161 --> 02:04:23.151
would like to make a perception check

02:04:23.151 --> 02:04:25.051
to see if they can make out details.

02:04:25.051 --> 02:04:26.551
TRAVIS: I'll assist you.

02:04:26.551 --> 02:04:29.835
TALIESIN: Please, actually.
SAM: "I'll assist you."

02:04:29.835 --> 02:04:31.400
TALIESIN: That does help.

02:04:31.400 --> 02:04:32.826
MATT: You sounded like a witness protection

02:04:32.826 --> 02:04:33.701
voice modulator there.
TALIESIN: Oh, thank god.

02:04:33.701 --> 02:04:35.381
I got a 14.

02:04:35.381 --> 02:04:37.164
MATT: What was that?
TALIESIN: I got a 14.

02:04:38.491 --> 02:04:39.716
MATT: 14.

02:04:41.371 --> 02:04:43.141
You circle around for a bit and you can see

02:04:43.141 --> 02:04:47.221
there are ice spires that protrude from areas of this,

02:04:47.221 --> 02:04:50.321
some of them unnaturally so, where it'll be flat

02:04:50.321 --> 02:04:52.511
and then occasionally there's just a spike that you imagine

02:04:52.511 --> 02:04:55.701
probably thrusts 50, 60 feet out of the open space.

02:04:55.701 --> 02:04:57.061
Some of you see clusters of them.

02:04:57.061 --> 02:04:59.461
Occasionally, you can see discoloration beneath the ice,

02:04:59.461 --> 02:05:02.341
where the white and faint element of blue

02:05:02.341 --> 02:05:05.051
that refracts from the atmosphere shifts into

02:05:05.051 --> 02:05:08.431
almost darker coloration and then continues back into ice.

02:05:08.431 --> 02:05:12.821
This definitely is not natural in some ways.

02:05:12.821 --> 02:05:17.191
And if this is to be where the ruins of Aeor rest,

02:05:17.191 --> 02:05:20.261
you can definitely see why this would eventually draw

02:05:20.261 --> 02:05:22.961
the attention in people who travel to this region.

02:05:24.921 --> 02:05:28.671
But you find towards the end of the duration

02:05:28.671 --> 02:05:31.921
of your Polymorph, the first attempt begins

02:05:31.921 --> 02:05:34.891
to come to a close and you're

02:05:34.891 --> 02:05:38.001
over the center of this open valley.

02:05:38.001 --> 02:05:40.531
Would you like to continue with another spell slot

02:05:40.531 --> 02:05:42.164
to maintain your Polymorph?

02:05:43.571 --> 02:05:46.111
LAURA: Well, we should probably
land so we can talk for a second.

02:05:46.111 --> 02:05:47.191
MATT: Okay.

02:05:47.191 --> 02:05:49.021
TALIESIN: Let's land and walk for a second.

02:05:49.021 --> 02:05:52.121
LIAM: Warily on the ground here in this very strange place.

02:05:52.121 --> 02:05:52.954
MATT: Okay.

02:05:52.954 --> 02:05:53.787
LAURA: Yeah.

02:05:54.871 --> 02:05:56.991
MATT: So you all step down into the middle of this ice

02:05:56.991 --> 02:05:58.801
and as you hit, the ground is hard.

02:05:58.801 --> 02:06:01.471
There is a soft snow from the night before,

02:06:01.471 --> 02:06:03.141
but it's not as thick as where you had found it

02:06:03.141 --> 02:06:05.801
over the nearby mountain range and you can find areas

02:06:05.801 --> 02:06:08.454
where your foot finds ice and slides a bit.

02:06:10.137 --> 02:06:11.501
But you're comfortable, it's not

02:06:11.501 --> 02:06:13.151
super treacherous or anything.

02:06:13.151 --> 02:06:15.531
And you can see some of the odd spires

02:06:15.531 --> 02:06:18.141
and things that break out in the distance,

02:06:18.141 --> 02:06:21.241
100, 300, 500 feet off in different directions.

02:06:21.241 --> 02:06:22.111
LIAM: 500 feet.

02:06:22.111 --> 02:06:23.781
LAURA: I--
MARISHA: Does this, oh, go ahead.

02:06:23.781 --> 02:06:24.614
LAURA: Sorry.

02:06:24.614 --> 02:06:27.251
I can't Polymorph two of us again.

02:06:27.251 --> 02:06:29.858
I can only Polymorph one of us.

02:06:29.858 --> 02:06:33.433
So we're going to be in the same situation

02:06:33.433 --> 02:06:34.564
we were last night.

02:06:38.728 --> 02:06:39.881
LIAM: Well.

02:06:39.881 --> 02:06:41.930
SAM: We could go on foot.

02:06:41.930 --> 02:06:43.084
TALIESIN: We have a head start.

02:06:43.084 --> 02:06:46.744
MARISHA: And I'm good to get in my daily jog.

02:06:48.731 --> 02:06:53.304
SAM: When the Tomb Takers just tried to ambush us,

02:06:54.521 --> 02:06:57.764
how long had the stone been gone for?

02:07:01.169 --> 02:07:03.302
MARISHA: You mean just now at the base of the mountain?
LIAM: It's how long ago we teleported it away.

02:07:03.302 --> 02:07:04.785
SAM: Yeah, we teleported it away,

02:07:04.785 --> 02:07:06.931
and then was it five minutes later?

02:07:06.931 --> 02:07:08.011
An hour later?
MATT: It was pretty close,

02:07:08.011 --> 02:07:09.701
about 10 or so minutes.

02:07:09.701 --> 02:07:11.081
SAM: Okay.

02:07:11.081 --> 02:07:14.771
So we're not aware if they're tracking us or the stone.

02:07:14.771 --> 02:07:16.861
LAURA: They're tracking us. They have our blood.

02:07:16.861 --> 02:07:20.396
They're blood mages. That's what their power is.

02:07:21.251 --> 02:07:22.551
SAM: Cool.

02:07:22.551 --> 02:07:24.771
TRAVIS: They had been, at least, we think.

02:07:24.771 --> 02:07:26.881
SAM: They don't know whether we have the stone or not,

02:07:26.881 --> 02:07:28.221
is what I'm thinking.
LAURA: Probably not.

02:07:28.221 --> 02:07:29.341
SAM: Okay.
TALIESIN: I mean,

02:07:29.341 --> 02:07:30.611
to be fair, if we keep mentioning

02:07:30.611 --> 02:07:32.681
that we don't, they'll eventually know.

02:07:32.681 --> 02:07:33.861
SAM: Oh.
LIAM: Right.

02:07:33.861 --> 02:07:34.819
LAURA: Oh, right.
SAM: Oh, shit.

02:07:34.819 --> 02:07:36.151
LAURA: They're probably Scrying on us right now.

02:07:36.151 --> 02:07:37.261
SAM: We do have the stone.

02:07:37.261 --> 02:07:39.254
It's just hidden.
LIAM: They do it pretty often.

02:07:41.158 --> 02:07:44.034
In which direction in this bowl that we're in is Essek's--

02:07:44.034 --> 02:07:45.544
TALIESIN: I can't with that mustache.

02:07:46.791 --> 02:07:48.593
LIAM: -- base of operations?

02:07:48.593 --> 02:07:50.511
MATT: Do you have recollection of that?

02:07:50.511 --> 02:07:51.344
TRAVIS: Northwest.

02:07:52.601 --> 02:07:53.956
Oh, Essek's?
MATT: Essek's.

02:07:53.956 --> 02:07:56.482
TRAVIS: The far east side of Aeor.

02:07:56.482 --> 02:07:57.981
LIAM: And we're dead center?

02:07:57.981 --> 02:07:58.851
MATT: You are dead center.

02:07:58.851 --> 02:08:01.121
LIAM: And I know where north is, so I can point towards

02:08:01.121 --> 02:08:04.184
where east would be, so that's where we want to head.

02:08:06.341 --> 02:08:08.441
TRAVIS: I guess that's a fair question.

02:08:08.441 --> 02:08:09.874
Do I have the map anymore?

02:08:11.891 --> 02:08:16.891
MATT: If you were keeping it within your bag,

02:08:17.111 --> 02:08:19.141
which you likely were, probably not.

02:08:19.141 --> 02:08:20.451
LIAM: Well, also, if they've talked

02:08:20.451 --> 02:08:22.651
about it in the last month, which they have,

02:08:23.751 --> 02:08:26.511
again, Liam remembers nothing, but Caleb does.

02:08:26.511 --> 02:08:28.991
TRAVIS: I think I showed you the map at some point, so.

02:08:28.991 --> 02:08:30.816
TALIESIN: I'd say it's in there.

02:08:30.816 --> 02:08:34.381
MATT: Yeah, you have the information with Caleb's Keen Mind.
LIAM: We would've talked about the direction, where it was.

02:08:34.381 --> 02:08:35.541
TRAVIS: I remember that off-hand.

02:08:35.541 --> 02:08:38.141
LIAM: My character with a 20 intelligence will remember.

02:08:39.271 --> 02:08:42.244
I can't throw fire either.

02:08:42.244 --> 02:08:43.410
SAM: Oh no!
MATT: Okay.

02:08:43.410 --> 02:08:45.341
MATT: (laughs)

02:08:45.341 --> 02:08:47.924
LIAM: Well, perhaps we should make distance, then.

02:08:49.071 --> 02:08:52.151
They maybe have given up on us already.
TRAVIS: That little bastard.

02:08:52.151 --> 02:08:53.021
SAM: I hope so.
LIAM: If we're lucky,

02:08:53.021 --> 02:08:55.111
but if not, we should move.

02:08:55.111 --> 02:08:57.461
TALIESIN: We should keep moving.
Let's move in that direction.

02:08:57.461 --> 02:08:59.681
LIAM: (sighs) Don't let them close the distance,

02:08:59.681 --> 02:09:00.661
if they're following.

02:09:00.661 --> 02:09:02.711
TRAVIS: Agreed.
LAURA: So even if we're flying

02:09:02.711 --> 02:09:03.971
slower, we're still flying.

02:09:03.971 --> 02:09:06.521
LIAM: You want to load up and fly or do you want to walk?

02:09:06.521 --> 02:09:07.564
LAURA: Either way.

02:09:08.818 --> 02:09:10.911
TRAVIS: Just in a bit we could lower our altitude

02:09:10.911 --> 02:09:13.441
just for, you know, shit's sake.

02:09:13.441 --> 02:09:15.194
LAURA: Oh, we're not flying, we're walking now.

02:09:15.194 --> 02:09:16.152
TRAVIS: Oh, great!

02:09:16.152 --> 02:09:16.985
LAURA: Yeah.

02:09:16.985 --> 02:09:18.821
Like I said, we don't have the ability

02:09:18.821 --> 02:09:22.186
to Polymorph three of us. It's only two people, so.

02:09:22.186 --> 02:09:24.411
LIAM: Do you mind if we at least keep moving east on foot

02:09:24.411 --> 02:09:27.531
until we get near one of these spires to take a look at it?

02:09:27.531 --> 02:09:28.364
TALIESIN: Sure.

02:09:29.501 --> 02:09:31.371
We are walking through this whole conversation.

02:09:31.371 --> 02:09:32.411
MATT: Indeed.
LAURA: Yes, yes, yes, yes.

02:09:32.411 --> 02:09:33.811
LIAM: It's a walk and talk.
TALIESIN: Walk and talk.

02:09:33.811 --> 02:09:36.851
MARISHA: I'm assuming that where we are fits

02:09:36.851 --> 02:09:39.851
with the writings from the explorer and journal

02:09:39.851 --> 02:09:44.710
that we read from the pages of this massive anomaly.

02:09:44.710 --> 02:09:45.963
Does this feel like it--
MATT: It certainly seems

02:09:45.963 --> 02:09:49.241
like an anomaly. The coloration of this valley definitely,

02:09:49.241 --> 02:09:52.051
and the topography of it seems odd enough,

02:09:52.051 --> 02:09:53.751
based on the rest of Eiselcross

02:09:53.751 --> 02:09:55.507
that you've encountered in this time

02:09:55.507 --> 02:09:59.041
that you've been here, that it it just feels different.

02:09:59.041 --> 02:10:01.251
The coloration is different, the way the ice settles,

02:10:01.251 --> 02:10:04.164
the way these odd shapes protrude.

02:10:09.504 --> 02:10:12.431
Caduceus, Caleb, and Beauregard,

02:10:12.431 --> 02:10:17.431
with your passive perceptions, now that you rest on here

02:10:17.711 --> 02:10:19.321
and look about, you feel like

02:10:19.321 --> 02:10:22.394
this valley is at a very faint angle, too.

02:10:24.581 --> 02:10:26.048
ASHLEY: Oh.

02:10:26.048 --> 02:10:29.031
MATT: As you're walking, you feel--
MARISHA: And you said that the snow was harder?

02:10:29.031 --> 02:10:30.499
MATT: Yeah.
LAURA: Is this a ruin?

02:10:30.499 --> 02:10:31.686
(cell phone chime)

02:10:31.686 --> 02:10:34.241
LAURA: Oops.
MARISHA: I think we're standing

02:10:34.241 --> 02:10:36.521
on top of a plate.

02:10:36.521 --> 02:10:37.451
SAM: A plate?

02:10:37.451 --> 02:10:39.181
TALIESIN: We are.
SAM: What does that mean?

02:10:39.181 --> 02:10:41.991
MARISHA: If a piece of the city fell out of the sky.

02:10:41.991 --> 02:10:42.824
LIAM: On an angle.

02:10:42.824 --> 02:10:46.991
MARISHA: And fell at an angle, and this ground feels harder

02:10:48.131 --> 02:10:50.881
than the six feet of snow we've been trudging through.

02:10:50.881 --> 02:10:52.051
SAM: This is Aeor.

02:10:52.051 --> 02:10:53.743
MARISHA: Yeah, we're on Aeor.
TALIEISN: Right on top of it.

02:10:53.743 --> 02:10:55.353
MARISHA: It's one of the chunks.

02:10:55.353 --> 02:10:58.611
LIAM: Also, you know, when you drop a stone

02:10:58.611 --> 02:11:01.036
into a bucket or a pond

02:11:01.036 --> 02:11:03.921
and it goes down and a little bloop flies up

02:11:03.921 --> 02:11:07.571
out of the water, maybe that's what this is.

02:11:07.571 --> 02:11:08.404
SAM: The mountains?

02:11:08.404 --> 02:11:09.461
LIAM AND TALIESIN: The spires.

02:11:09.461 --> 02:11:10.835
SAM: Oh.
LIAM: Maybe.

02:11:10.835 --> 02:11:11.961
MARISHA: Because do they look like ice?

02:11:11.961 --> 02:11:13.339
Is that what you're saying?

02:11:13.339 --> 02:11:14.981
LAURA: They were going (swoosh).

02:11:14.981 --> 02:11:16.411
LIAM: Well--
MATT: You walk far enough

02:11:16.411 --> 02:11:19.171
to get to the closest spire in the direction

02:11:19.171 --> 02:11:21.551
you're traveling, which only takes about five,

02:11:21.551 --> 02:11:22.971
six minutes on foot to get towards,

02:11:22.971 --> 02:11:25.729
and this one probably rises about 15,

02:11:25.729 --> 02:11:28.961
20 feet, not terribly high, but it is wide.

02:11:28.961 --> 02:11:32.291
It's about maybe 10 feet at its base.

02:11:32.291 --> 02:11:37.291
And it has a natural craggy ice exterior

02:11:37.291 --> 02:11:40.144
before it comes to a gradual, slightly shifted point.

02:11:41.451 --> 02:11:44.861
And there are some small outcroppings

02:11:44.861 --> 02:11:47.571
where you can see it has a natural feel to it.

02:11:47.571 --> 02:11:51.351
LIAM: Does it share the same slight angle as the ground

02:11:51.351 --> 02:11:54.519
we're walking on? Or does it go straight to the sky?

02:11:54.519 --> 02:11:55.521
MATT: No, it's at an angle.

02:11:55.521 --> 02:11:56.354
LIAM: Yeah.

02:11:57.981 --> 02:11:59.151
TALIEISN: It--

02:11:59.151 --> 02:12:00.551
TRAVIS: That's just great.

02:12:01.941 --> 02:12:03.156
TALIESIN: Is there anything inside of it

02:12:03.156 --> 02:12:06.191
or is it possible to see directly through it?

02:12:06.191 --> 02:12:08.186
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:12:08.186 --> 02:12:10.271
I mean, it's pretty opaque, but if you want to go

02:12:10.271 --> 02:12:11.691
and approach and wipe away--

02:12:11.691 --> 02:12:13.421
TALIEISN: I'm just trying to shine a light through it,

02:12:13.421 --> 02:12:15.204
like an iPhone.

02:12:15.204 --> 02:12:16.661
LAURA: (laughs)

02:12:16.661 --> 02:12:18.211
Let me pull out my cell phone.

02:12:20.781 --> 02:12:22.971
TALIESIN: Boy, this is so embarrassing.

02:12:22.971 --> 02:12:24.191
I can't wait to-- 20.
SAM: Caduceus is the kind

02:12:24.191 --> 02:12:26.621
of person who would have his iPhone flashlight on

02:12:26.621 --> 02:12:28.160
for a long time.

02:12:28.160 --> 02:12:28.993
MATT: Yep.
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:12:28.993 --> 02:12:30.318
SAM: And just be like--
LAURA: (laughs)

02:12:30.318 --> 02:12:31.928
ASHLEY: It's his iPad flashlight.
TALIESIN: The battery keeps running out,

02:12:31.928 --> 02:12:32.999
I don't know why.

02:12:32.999 --> 02:12:34.479
(laughter)

02:12:34.479 --> 02:12:35.681
TALIESIN: I have to start bringing my glasses to this.

02:12:35.681 --> 02:12:38.351
That's terrible. I hate getting old.

02:12:38.351 --> 02:12:39.861
MATT: The ice that the spire's constructed

02:12:39.861 --> 02:12:43.281
of itself is mostly opaque.

02:12:43.281 --> 02:12:45.691
It is not smooth, clear glass like ice.

02:12:45.691 --> 02:12:49.331
It has heavy texture and a lot of imperfection

02:12:49.331 --> 02:12:52.211
throughout its surface, so you cannot see deep into it,

02:12:52.211 --> 02:12:53.784
maybe just about an inch or so.

02:12:54.721 --> 02:12:55.781
You can't make out any detail.

02:12:55.781 --> 02:12:57.891
You can't really tell if it's natural or not,

02:12:57.891 --> 02:13:02.851
but nevertheless, it does seem consistent and oddly matches

02:13:04.731 --> 02:13:07.891
a lot of the ground topography surrounding as well.

02:13:07.891 --> 02:13:10.111
SAM: Mysterious icy pillar?

02:13:10.111 --> 02:13:12.731
I mean, I feel like we spend a few hours here, right?

02:13:12.731 --> 02:13:14.783
(laughter)

02:13:14.783 --> 02:13:16.058
MATT: That's on brand.

02:13:16.058 --> 02:13:18.784
MARISHA: There's no Dagen here to tell us not to.

02:13:18.784 --> 02:13:20.086
TRAVIS: Oh, Dagen, jeez.

02:13:20.086 --> 02:13:21.591
SAM: Dagen!
LAURA: He's probably made it

02:13:21.591 --> 02:13:22.541
to Essek by now.

02:13:22.541 --> 02:13:23.651
TALIESIN: We keep walking.

02:13:23.651 --> 02:13:25.294
MATT: All right.
SAM: We could talk to him.

02:13:25.294 --> 02:13:26.235
MATT: So it's a bit of a journey.

02:13:26.235 --> 02:13:29.322
I would like someone to go ahead and roll a d20 for me.

02:13:29.322 --> 02:13:30.538
LAURA: I'll do it!
TRAVIS: Where are we? Where are we?

02:13:30.538 --> 02:13:31.963
SAM: Oh.
ASHLEY: I think I did last--

02:13:31.963 --> 02:13:33.037
with the dragon?
SAM: I agree.

02:13:33.037 --> 02:13:34.255
MARISHA: You were last, yeah.

02:13:34.255 --> 02:13:35.730
TALIESIN: Good, I've been rolling real well.

02:13:35.730 --> 02:13:36.691
This will be funny.

02:13:36.691 --> 02:13:38.631
Actually, let's use the ice die, this will be fun.

02:13:38.631 --> 02:13:39.464
Ice die.

02:13:40.767 --> 02:13:41.821
TRAVIS: (blows raspberry)

02:13:41.821 --> 02:13:43.161
TALIESIN: What does a 14 mean?
(laughter)

02:13:43.161 --> 02:13:45.151
Thank you, I'm not Sam.

02:13:45.151 --> 02:13:46.164
MATT: 14.

02:13:47.201 --> 02:13:50.241
Go ahead-- no, wait, that's wrong.

02:13:50.241 --> 02:13:52.397
LIAM: Roll a d6, then a d8

02:13:52.397 --> 02:13:53.911
and 2d20s.
TRAVIS: Give me giants.

02:13:53.911 --> 02:13:56.841
SAM: (laughs) And then a d3?
MATT: We've already done that one, actually.

02:13:56.841 --> 02:13:57.871
Roll again, 'cause we've already got

02:13:57.871 --> 02:13:59.511
that encounter and I forgot to change it.

02:13:59.511 --> 02:14:01.701
SAM: Oh, shit.
MATT: Sorry.

02:14:01.701 --> 02:14:02.827
TALIESIN: 12!

02:14:02.827 --> 02:14:03.660
MATT: 12.

02:14:03.660 --> 02:14:05.222
LIAM: Gelidon erupts from the ground.

02:14:05.222 --> 02:14:06.738
(laughter)

02:14:06.738 --> 02:14:07.979
SAM: (roaring)

02:14:07.979 --> 02:14:09.841
TRAVIS: Mecha Gelidon.

02:14:09.841 --> 02:14:10.724
MATT: Yeah.

02:14:10.724 --> 02:14:12.304
LIAM: (screeching)

02:14:12.304 --> 02:14:13.615
TRAVIS: Shit!

02:14:13.615 --> 02:14:14.951
MATT: (laser firing)

02:14:14.951 --> 02:14:16.346
MARISHA: It's been 12 hours!
MATT: (explosion)

02:14:16.346 --> 02:14:18.384
(laughter)

02:14:18.384 --> 02:14:19.582
TALIESIN: (yelling)

02:14:19.582 --> 02:14:21.096
MATT: She's got a Vulcan cannon in the front.

02:14:21.096 --> 02:14:23.381
TALIESIN: I still have a point of
exhaustion, for god's sake.

02:14:23.381 --> 02:14:25.001
MATT: No, relatively clear.

02:14:25.001 --> 02:14:26.141
The weather begins to clear up a bit,

02:14:26.141 --> 02:14:28.681
the clouds break, and for the first time in a short time,

02:14:28.681 --> 02:14:30.581
you see the blue sky above and it as welcome.

02:14:30.581 --> 02:14:32.151
It does warm a bit as the sunlight begins

02:14:32.151 --> 02:14:34.541
to come through and at least the day seems

02:14:34.541 --> 02:14:38.731
to be a little more welcoming to your journey eastward.

02:14:38.731 --> 02:14:40.841
Heading in the southeastern direction

02:14:40.841 --> 02:14:43.748
from where you were standing towards where you believe Essek

02:14:43.748 --> 02:14:48.444
had said he was currently residing, an outpost of some kind,

02:14:49.431 --> 02:14:52.964
who's keeping visual eyesight for this?

02:14:54.301 --> 02:14:55.351
TRAVIS: The high perception kids.

02:14:55.351 --> 02:14:57.011
LIAM: I'll keep an eye out, yeah.

02:14:57.011 --> 02:14:57.969
Do we want to give word--
TALIESIN: High perception,

02:14:57.969 --> 02:14:59.811
LIAM: -- that we're on our way?
TALIESIN: -- but I'm exhausted.

02:14:59.811 --> 02:15:02.371
LAURA: Oh, then I can look.

02:15:02.371 --> 02:15:03.687
TALIESIN: Okay.
LAURA: Mine's decent.

02:15:03.687 --> 02:15:05.560
MATT: Okay, so then I would have Caleb and Jester

02:15:05.560 --> 02:15:07.294
go ahead and roll perception checks, please.

02:15:10.295 --> 02:15:12.209
LAURA: (laughs)

02:15:12.209 --> 02:15:14.000
TRAVIS: Fucking what?

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:15.532
Damn it. What is it?
LIAM: What'd you get?

02:15:15.532 --> 02:15:17.902
LAURA: It wasn't the cake, you guys, it wasn't the cake.

02:15:17.902 --> 02:15:19.211
LIAM: You get a one?
LAURA: Yeah. (laughs)

02:15:19.211 --> 02:15:20.061
LIAM: Well, I rolled a 25.

02:15:20.061 --> 02:15:22.271
LAURA: I'm going to put this over here.

02:15:22.271 --> 02:15:24.771
MATT: You rolled a 25?
LIAM: Yeah.

02:15:24.771 --> 02:15:25.688
MATT: Okay.

02:15:27.435 --> 02:15:30.591
As you continue to traverse

02:15:30.591 --> 02:15:32.271
this frost-covered, jagged landscape,

02:15:32.271 --> 02:15:34.891
this odd valley of death

02:15:34.891 --> 02:15:36.374
nestled within these alien mountains

02:15:36.374 --> 02:15:39.151
that surround the outskirts--
TRAVIS: Yeah, it really is.

02:15:39.151 --> 02:15:40.009
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:15:40.009 --> 02:15:41.335
MATT: You have a hard time seeing anything

02:15:41.335 --> 02:15:42.593
that resembles an outpost.

02:15:43.801 --> 02:15:47.561
You notice about a mile off from where you currently

02:15:47.561 --> 02:15:50.271
are walking, you see a heavier cluster

02:15:50.271 --> 02:15:53.961
of these crooked ice spires, maybe about seven,

02:15:53.961 --> 02:15:56.071
eight of them, though one of them seems a bit smaller,

02:15:56.071 --> 02:15:59.414
that are all in this centralized area,

02:16:02.141 --> 02:16:05.571
oddly glacial ice, just jutting out.

02:16:05.571 --> 02:16:09.071
You swear you see a handful of smaller humanoid creatures

02:16:09.071 --> 02:16:10.319
rapidly move from one chunk

02:16:10.319 --> 02:16:11.951
of the terrain to the next.

02:16:11.951 --> 02:16:13.181
LIAM: And the ice spires, are they leaning

02:16:13.181 --> 02:16:15.194
like pick-up sticks in a way?

02:16:15.194 --> 02:16:16.800
MATT: They seem to be at odd angles.

02:16:16.800 --> 02:16:17.633
LIAM: Okay.

02:16:17.633 --> 02:16:19.461
MATT: From your current perspective.

02:16:19.461 --> 02:16:21.181
You're not close enough to make out any specifics.

02:16:21.181 --> 02:16:23.628
LIAM: Mile off from where we are, you said?
MATT: Yeah.

02:16:23.628 --> 02:16:25.704
TALIESIN: Not quite Fortress of Solitude stones.

02:16:26.571 --> 02:16:27.901
LIAM: I don't know if that's what we want,

02:16:27.901 --> 02:16:31.636
but there is some sort of a grouping of persons,

02:16:31.636 --> 02:16:33.021
a mile off in that direction.

02:16:33.021 --> 02:16:35.631
LAURA: Did they seem like they noticed us?

02:16:35.631 --> 02:16:37.284
LIAM: That's far, I don't know.

02:16:38.201 --> 02:16:39.811
SAM: Is it them?

02:16:39.811 --> 02:16:41.321
LIAM: I don't know.

02:16:41.321 --> 02:16:43.871
LAURA: Should I send a message to Essek?

02:16:43.871 --> 02:16:44.801
LIAM: Couldn't hurt.

02:16:44.801 --> 02:16:46.419
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:16:46.419 --> 02:16:47.929
LAURA: Where should I say we are?

02:16:47.929 --> 02:16:48.762
LIAM: Well.

02:16:50.141 --> 02:16:51.689
SAM: En route?
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)

02:16:51.689 --> 02:16:52.697
LIAM: Say we're en route

02:16:52.697 --> 02:16:54.262
and ask what we should be looking for.
MARISHA: Say we're 10 minutes away.

02:16:54.262 --> 02:16:55.451
SAM: Wait, should we

02:16:55.451 --> 02:16:57.811
See Invisibility and, you know,

02:16:57.811 --> 02:16:59.948
see if they're looking at us right now?

02:17:01.581 --> 02:17:02.814
Can you do that, Fjordy?

02:17:02.814 --> 02:17:04.421
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm, do we want to?

02:17:04.421 --> 02:17:06.671
LIAM: (sighs) Why don't we just talk to the boss?

02:17:07.724 --> 02:17:08.764
LAURA: Sure.

02:17:08.764 --> 02:17:11.443
TRAVIS: Sure, I'll summon the sword.

02:17:11.443 --> 02:17:12.493
MATT: All right.

02:17:12.493 --> 02:17:13.911
TRAVIS: See Invisibility.

02:17:13.911 --> 02:17:16.144
MATT: Glancing around the space, make a perception check.

02:17:18.782 --> 02:17:19.615
TRAVIS: That's cocked.

02:17:21.151 --> 02:17:22.781
Natural 20.
SAM: (gasps)

02:17:22.781 --> 02:17:23.706
TRAVIS: For a 23.

02:17:23.706 --> 02:17:24.847
MATT: 23.

02:17:24.847 --> 02:17:28.593
Looking about the space, no sign of any sort

02:17:28.593 --> 02:17:32.101
of arcane point of visualization.

02:17:32.101 --> 02:17:33.201
You feel pretty clear.

02:17:33.201 --> 02:17:34.611
TRAVIS: Good to go.

02:17:34.611 --> 02:17:36.111
LAURA: Okay.

02:17:36.111 --> 02:17:37.719
I'll send a message to Essek.

02:17:40.861 --> 02:17:43.031
Okay, we're en route.

02:17:44.421 --> 02:17:46.951
We're in the middle of a bunch of spires.

02:17:46.951 --> 02:17:48.651
What should we be looking for?

02:17:48.651 --> 02:17:50.102
How do we find you?

02:17:53.948 --> 02:17:56.198
(laughter)

02:17:58.784 --> 02:18:00.939
LIAM: You could wrap it up early.

02:18:00.939 --> 02:18:01.772
SAM: No!

02:18:04.491 --> 02:18:06.260
LAURA: Gee whiz.

02:18:06.260 --> 02:18:08.510
(laughter)

02:18:10.751 --> 02:18:12.922
You are great!

02:18:12.922 --> 02:18:15.091
(laughter)

02:18:15.091 --> 02:18:17.061
(clapping)

02:18:17.061 --> 02:18:18.423
LIAM: You're right.

02:18:18.423 --> 02:18:20.804
TRAVIS: I'm glad we weighed that out that heavily.

02:18:20.804 --> 02:18:21.791
SAM: Worth it!

02:18:21.791 --> 02:18:22.851
TALIESIN: That was perfect.

02:18:22.851 --> 02:18:24.938
MATT: You get a response.

02:18:24.938 --> 02:18:25.938
TRAVIS: (laughs)

02:18:25.938 --> 02:18:30.938
MATT: "Well, thank you for your kind words.

02:18:30.961 --> 02:18:31.794
"Good.

02:18:33.451 --> 02:18:38.249
"Look for the larger-spired clusters.

02:18:40.821 --> 02:18:42.079
"Be mindful.

02:18:43.104 --> 02:18:44.307
"No weapons out."

02:18:45.181 --> 02:18:46.789
SAM: Oh. Oh!

02:18:46.789 --> 02:18:48.095
Oh.

02:18:48.095 --> 02:18:49.341
MATT: That's it.
LAURA: Good to know.

02:18:49.341 --> 02:18:52.251
He said be mindful, no weapons out.

02:18:52.251 --> 02:18:54.324
Large clusters of spires.

02:18:55.311 --> 02:18:58.521
SAM: But Beau's body is a weapon.

02:18:58.521 --> 02:18:59.806
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:18:59.806 --> 02:19:00.891
(laughter)

02:19:00.891 --> 02:19:02.611
Damn straight.

02:19:02.611 --> 02:19:05.661
LIAM: Think of the magical echoing pauses that he listens to.

02:19:05.661 --> 02:19:07.071
"Gee whiz."

02:19:07.071 --> 02:19:08.291
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)

02:19:08.291 --> 02:19:09.706
LIAM: "You are

02:19:10.707 --> 02:19:12.136
"s-great."

02:19:12.136 --> 02:19:14.716
(laughter)

02:19:14.716 --> 02:19:17.833
MATT: Also, Jester, if you could roll a d20 for me, please.

02:19:17.833 --> 02:19:19.867
TRAVIS: 'Cause you used magic.

02:19:19.867 --> 02:19:21.238
LAURA: What?
SAM: Oh, maybe.

02:19:21.238 --> 02:19:22.964
LAURA: No.
SAM: Something else?

02:19:24.231 --> 02:19:26.201
MATT: Sorry, a d100, not a d20.

02:19:26.201 --> 02:19:27.034
TALIESIN: Oh, we're going there.

02:19:27.034 --> 02:19:29.758
LAURA: I don't have a d100, do I roll two percentiles?

02:19:29.758 --> 02:19:32.041
MATT: You roll two percentile dice, is the d100.

02:19:32.041 --> 02:19:33.221
TALIESIN: Okay, good to know.
LAURA: One percentile,

02:19:33.221 --> 02:19:34.131
one not percentile.
SAM: Oh, maybe 'cause

02:19:34.131 --> 02:19:36.039
we're getting closer, it's just always?

02:19:36.039 --> 02:19:37.184
LAURA: Do I know what I'm doing?
MARISHA: It's magic?

02:19:37.184 --> 02:19:38.334
MATT: Mm-hmm.

02:19:40.631 --> 02:19:42.851
LIAM: Always be casting.

02:19:42.851 --> 02:19:46.495
LAURA: I rolled a 10 and a seven, so 17.

02:19:46.495 --> 02:19:47.328
MATT: Okay.

02:19:48.711 --> 02:19:49.721
I'm sorry, misread my rule there.

02:19:49.721 --> 02:19:51.471
Do roll a d20 for me.

02:19:52.671 --> 02:19:54.348
I had it right, and then I second guessed myself.

02:19:54.348 --> 02:19:55.181
That happens all the time.

02:19:55.181 --> 02:19:56.761
TRAVIS: That felt gnarly, 17 felt gnarly.

02:19:56.761 --> 02:19:57.594
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:19:57.594 --> 02:19:59.661
LAURA: Wouldn't it be funny if
I had rolled a 17 on the 20 too?

02:19:59.661 --> 02:20:01.361
But I didn't, I rolled a five.

02:20:01.361 --> 02:20:04.143
MATT: Okay, you're fine.
(laughter)

02:20:04.143 --> 02:20:04.976
LAURA: Okay.

02:20:06.781 --> 02:20:07.911
SAM: We okay?

02:20:07.911 --> 02:20:08.927
MATT: You're fine.

02:20:11.149 --> 02:20:12.698
TRAVIS: (squelching)

02:20:12.698 --> 02:20:13.831
MARISHA: Is it--?
TRAVIS: (squelching)

02:20:13.831 --> 02:20:15.854
MARISHA: Yeah, that was weird. (laughs)

02:20:15.854 --> 02:20:17.731
LAURA: That was very strange. (laughs)

02:20:17.731 --> 02:20:19.531
TRAVIS: I got so many over here now.

02:20:19.531 --> 02:20:20.869
TALIESIN: Weapons not out and keep walking,

02:20:20.869 --> 02:20:21.749
I guess.
LAURA: Okay.

02:20:21.749 --> 02:20:23.891
LIAM: Yeah.
TRAVIS: I could just juggle these fuckers.

02:20:26.021 --> 02:20:27.644
MATT: You jaunt on for a bit longer,

02:20:28.551 --> 02:20:33.551
and as you get closer, you begin to see figures moving

02:20:33.891 --> 02:20:36.421
between the various towers and such.

02:20:36.421 --> 02:20:39.581
And then, they all of a sudden scatter and it's quiet.

02:20:39.581 --> 02:20:41.737
SAM: These aren't the same ones that he saw before, right?

02:20:41.737 --> 02:20:42.651
MATT: It's the same location.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:20:42.651 --> 02:20:43.761
SAM: Oh, okay.
MATT: Yeah.

02:20:43.761 --> 02:20:46.741
But you see some movement and then you see none.

02:20:46.741 --> 02:20:50.181
And then, as you approach closer and closer still, nothing.

02:20:50.181 --> 02:20:51.471
TRAVIS: Skies?

02:20:51.471 --> 02:20:52.487
MATT: Sky's clear.

02:20:53.541 --> 02:20:55.261
MARISHA: Does this look like the cluster

02:20:55.261 --> 02:20:58.249
of spires Essek could've been referencing?

02:20:58.249 --> 02:20:59.781
MATT: This is the one that Caleb saw

02:20:59.781 --> 02:21:00.951
earlier.
LIAM: Yeah.

02:21:00.951 --> 02:21:01.881
That was confirmation.

02:21:01.881 --> 02:21:04.601
I'm going to pull out and hold up the medallion.

02:21:04.601 --> 02:21:06.071
MARISHA: I hold my hands up.

02:21:07.901 --> 02:21:08.871
SAM: The medallion of--

02:21:08.871 --> 02:21:10.261
LIAM: The sign of the queen.

02:21:10.261 --> 02:21:11.131
SAM: The Bright Queen.

02:21:11.131 --> 02:21:11.964
Oh, that's a good idea.
LIAM: Yeah,

02:21:11.964 --> 02:21:14.064
that we all have.
SAM: Yeah, I'll whip out mine, too.

02:21:14.064 --> 02:21:16.645
TRAVIS:I don't have mine anymore. (whimpers)

02:21:16.645 --> 02:21:18.651
LAURA: Oh, you don't have anything anymore, Fjord.

02:21:18.651 --> 02:21:19.881
TALIESIN: You didn't keep it on your person?

02:21:19.881 --> 02:21:22.562
You put it in the bag?
LAURA: Are you at least wearing your ring?

02:21:22.562 --> 02:21:23.395
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:21:23.395 --> 02:21:24.769
Yeah, yeah, I'm attuned to it.
MARISHA: I technically don't

02:21:24.769 --> 02:21:26.986
have mine either. I gave it to Dairon.

02:21:26.986 --> 02:21:28.281
LIAM: As long as some of us have it, should be good.

02:21:28.281 --> 02:21:29.635
TALIESIN: As long as a few of us,

02:21:29.635 --> 02:21:30.941
we're all right.
MARISHA: Yeah, we're together.

02:21:30.941 --> 02:21:31.774
LAURA: We're fine.

02:21:31.774 --> 02:21:32.854
MARISHA: We got plus-ones.

02:21:32.854 --> 02:21:36.028
MATT: You get within a few hundred feet of--

02:21:37.761 --> 02:21:41.924
pardon me, the outskirts of this spire cluster

02:21:41.924 --> 02:21:43.801
before you see (popping) out of the snow

02:21:43.801 --> 02:21:46.551
in several different locations, a bunch of archers

02:21:46.551 --> 02:21:49.791
and crossbowmen, just (crashing) in the space.

02:21:49.791 --> 02:21:51.871
They shout something in Undercommon.

02:21:51.871 --> 02:21:52.850
Anybody here speak Undercommon?

02:21:52.850 --> 02:21:53.934
MARISHA: I do.

02:21:53.934 --> 02:21:56.811
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: You hear, "Halt!

02:21:56.811 --> 02:21:58.616
"What's your business?"

02:21:58.616 --> 02:22:00.142
TRAVIS: Be nice.

02:22:00.142 --> 02:22:01.492
MARISHA: I'll be nice, I'll be nice, I'll be nice.

02:22:01.492 --> 02:22:04.249
I respond in Undercommon.

02:22:04.249 --> 02:22:09.027
We're friends of the Dynasty, looking for Essek Thelon.

02:22:09.027 --> 02:22:09.976
LIAM: Thelyss.
MARISHA: Thelyss!

02:22:09.976 --> 02:22:11.476
(laughter)

02:22:11.476 --> 02:22:12.416
I didn't say Thelon,

02:22:12.416 --> 02:22:13.324
I said Thelyss in-game.
TRAVIS: It's Undercommon,

02:22:13.324 --> 02:22:14.881
it's all like-- (harsh noises)

02:22:14.881 --> 02:22:18.205
MARISHA: Sorry, my accent sucks.

02:22:18.205 --> 02:22:20.321
MATT: You see one of them approaches,

02:22:20.321 --> 02:22:24.531
and you can see now, there's heavy white-furred cloaks

02:22:24.531 --> 02:22:26.831
that blend in really well with the snowy surroundings,

02:22:26.831 --> 02:22:28.521
but right beneath it, as the arms come out,

02:22:28.521 --> 02:22:31.991
the armor is very familiar aspects

02:22:31.991 --> 02:22:34.521
of the Aurora Watch, almost organic,

02:22:34.521 --> 02:22:36.711
tight metallic armor that you've seen before.

02:22:36.711 --> 02:22:40.711
The chitinous, insect-like designs, but with heavy fur

02:22:40.711 --> 02:22:42.381
at the various edges to help keep it warm.

02:22:42.381 --> 02:22:43.214
TRAVIS: Sick.
LAURA: Ooh, cool.

02:22:43.214 --> 02:22:44.638
MATT: As they approach, the crossbow up,

02:22:44.638 --> 02:22:46.381
the one looks forward and glances at the symbols

02:22:46.381 --> 02:22:48.714
you're holding up from about 50 feet away and goes,

02:22:50.021 --> 02:22:52.201
"They're friends, they're friends."

02:22:52.201 --> 02:22:54.831
Everyone puts their weapons down, mostly.

02:22:54.831 --> 02:22:56.241
They're still holding them there,

02:22:56.241 --> 02:22:58.431
but they're definitely more relaxed.

02:22:58.431 --> 02:23:02.151
And the one that's towards you all goes, "Follow me."

02:23:02.151 --> 02:23:04.191
And they all still keep a circle around you,

02:23:04.191 --> 02:23:07.001
but it's less aggressive and guarding

02:23:07.001 --> 02:23:09.811
and more just traveling with you.

02:23:09.811 --> 02:23:11.888
As you begin to make your way, you can see on the side

02:23:11.888 --> 02:23:15.546
of one of these spires, a door opens.

02:23:15.546 --> 02:23:16.379
ALL: (gasping)

02:23:16.379 --> 02:23:19.321
MATT: And from the inside, you can see this warm,

02:23:19.321 --> 02:23:23.601
constructed interior and immediately you begin to suss out

02:23:23.601 --> 02:23:27.141
that these spires are some sort of illusory construct,

02:23:27.141 --> 02:23:29.361
that there is actually a small outpost here

02:23:29.361 --> 02:23:31.241
that is completely masqueraded with magic.

02:23:31.241 --> 02:23:32.492
LIAM: Oh.
MARISHA: Cool!

02:23:32.492 --> 02:23:34.033
LAURA: That is so awesome!

02:23:34.033 --> 02:23:35.291
MATT: But as the door opens, you see

02:23:35.291 --> 02:23:36.954
a figure just drift out.

02:23:36.954 --> 02:23:37.787
LAURA and ASHLEY: (gasping)

02:23:37.787 --> 02:23:40.001
MATT: You see the familiar

02:23:41.231 --> 02:23:43.954
white, short hair,

02:23:45.211 --> 02:23:50.211
odd grin, and now a heavy white-fur collared

02:23:50.681 --> 02:23:53.631
long, purple-black cloak,

02:23:53.631 --> 02:23:57.125
as the Shadowhand, Essek Thelyss drifts towards you.

02:23:57.125 --> 02:23:58.864
LAURA: I run over and hug him!

02:23:58.864 --> 02:24:00.310
MATT: (Essek stammering)

02:24:00.310 --> 02:24:01.755
LAURA: It's so good to see you!

02:24:01.755 --> 02:24:03.388
MATT: "Ah--" And everyone stops and

02:24:03.388 --> 02:24:04.986
gives a curious head turn.

02:24:04.986 --> 02:24:05.819
"Ahem."

02:24:05.819 --> 02:24:06.991
LAURA: Oh, sorry.

02:24:06.991 --> 02:24:09.816
MATT: "It is good to see you as well, Jester."

02:24:09.816 --> 02:24:10.649
LAURA: Yes.

02:24:10.649 --> 02:24:12.571
MATT: "Mighty Nein, I am happy to see

02:24:12.571 --> 02:24:16.118
"that you traveled safely across these lands."

02:24:16.118 --> 02:24:17.801
TALIESIN: Mm.

02:24:17.801 --> 02:24:20.301
MATT: "Well, do come in, we have
much to discuss, I imagine."

02:24:20.301 --> 02:24:22.201
SAM: Yes.
TALIESIN: (sighs)

02:24:22.201 --> 02:24:23.401
LIAM: In private, hopefully.

02:24:24.311 --> 02:24:25.513
MATT: And glances out and puts a hand up

02:24:25.513 --> 02:24:26.691
to the rest of everybody and they begin

02:24:26.691 --> 02:24:28.701
to scatter and go about their business.

02:24:28.701 --> 02:24:30.981
You hear a couple of whistles go, this odd,

02:24:30.981 --> 02:24:33.331
metallic whistle-- (whistles)

02:24:33.331 --> 02:24:34.941
around and as it does, some of the doors begin

02:24:34.941 --> 02:24:36.661
to open and people begin going about their business.

02:24:36.661 --> 02:24:39.501
And in an instant, this quiet, desolate space,

02:24:39.501 --> 02:24:40.861
you begin to see other doors open

02:24:40.861 --> 02:24:43.038
and this becomes a bustling outpost again.

02:24:43.038 --> 02:24:44.571
MARISHA: Wow.
MATT: Where about a dozen

02:24:44.571 --> 02:24:48.021
to 14 or so people begin carrying materials back and forth.

02:24:48.021 --> 02:24:50.731
You can see people are in the process of building weapons

02:24:50.731 --> 02:24:53.361
and there's a hidden forge beneath an overhang

02:24:53.361 --> 02:24:55.151
that you couldn't see from the outside,

02:24:55.151 --> 02:24:56.491
but once you come around the opposite edge,

02:24:56.491 --> 02:24:59.081
you can see it's just a camouflaged tent top.

02:24:59.081 --> 02:25:00.901
And on the inside, you can see they're starting to get

02:25:00.901 --> 02:25:03.901
the bellows going and the flames starting to rise once more.

02:25:05.091 --> 02:25:07.561
But Essek leads you into the chambers

02:25:07.561 --> 02:25:10.461
where he emerged, and as you step inside,

02:25:10.461 --> 02:25:14.581
it is thankfully much warmer upon your approach.

02:25:14.581 --> 02:25:15.414
Relatively well lit.

02:25:15.414 --> 02:25:18.451
You can see a number of tables set out,

02:25:18.451 --> 02:25:21.211
heavy crates piled up with materials

02:25:21.211 --> 02:25:23.691
and supplies of some kind, a number

02:25:23.691 --> 02:25:26.041
of other Aurora's Watch soldiers surrounding you,

02:25:26.041 --> 02:25:29.501
chairs and other individuals that look over

02:25:29.501 --> 02:25:33.421
and give a nod as you enter, accompanied by Essek.

02:25:33.421 --> 02:25:35.511
You all step inside, the door is closed

02:25:35.511 --> 02:25:36.541
by one of the soldiers who

02:25:36.541 --> 02:25:39.201
just keeps post there, arms crossed.

02:25:39.201 --> 02:25:41.481
Essek spins around at the central table,

02:25:41.481 --> 02:25:44.731
and then glides down onto one of the nearby stools

02:25:44.731 --> 02:25:47.081
before looking you all over, his cloak throws back

02:25:47.081 --> 02:25:49.431
over his shoulders a bit, revealing his mantle.

02:25:50.481 --> 02:25:53.725
"So, friends, what brings you to Aeor?"

02:25:53.725 --> 02:25:54.991
LAURA: (overwhelmed laugh)
TALIESIN: (deep exhaling)

02:25:54.991 --> 02:25:57.374
TRAVIS: Anything that See Invisibility would pick up

02:25:57.374 --> 02:25:59.321
in this room that is not as it appears?

02:26:00.621 --> 02:26:01.454
MATT: Actually, yeah.

02:26:01.454 --> 02:26:02.601
Make a perception check for me.

02:26:02.601 --> 02:26:04.516
See if you catch anything.

02:26:05.991 --> 02:26:07.301
TRAVIS: 16.

02:26:07.301 --> 02:26:08.581
MATT: 16.

02:26:08.581 --> 02:26:12.921
You do see two soldiers that are currently cloaked

02:26:12.921 --> 02:26:17.271
through some sort of magic, that have heavy crossbows,

02:26:17.271 --> 02:26:19.651
that are in two different corners of the chamber.

02:26:19.651 --> 02:26:22.131
They're not up and ready, but they're just keeping watch.

02:26:22.131 --> 02:26:23.131
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:26:25.081 --> 02:26:28.461
TALIESIN: We have quite a bit to explain.

02:26:28.461 --> 02:26:31.541
Do we want to do this privately or privately-privately?

02:26:31.541 --> 02:26:33.874
There's a lot that's been happening.

02:26:36.491 --> 02:26:38.201
We are in desperate need of help.

02:26:38.201 --> 02:26:39.451
MATT: You see, he gives a glance

02:26:39.451 --> 02:26:41.901
throughout the room and says, "Anything you can say to me,

02:26:41.901 --> 02:26:44.051
"you can say to our friends in this chamber."

02:26:45.541 --> 02:26:47.261
MARISHA: And I'm assuming this chamber

02:26:47.261 --> 02:26:51.051
is pretty well protected from spies?

02:26:51.051 --> 02:26:52.301
Scrying magic?

02:26:52.301 --> 02:26:54.000
Anything that can see in?
MATT: "I certainly hope so."

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:58.401
SAM: Do you have anything like hot cocoa

02:26:58.401 --> 02:27:01.041
or an espresso with absinthe in it

02:27:01.041 --> 02:27:02.641
or anything at all?
TALIESIN: Hot water's all we need.

02:27:02.641 --> 02:27:04.041
I still have hot cocoa.

02:27:04.041 --> 02:27:05.450
LAURA: (gasps) Oh!

02:27:05.450 --> 02:27:06.741
Do you have hot water, Essek?

02:27:06.741 --> 02:27:08.191
We can make cocoa!

02:27:08.191 --> 02:27:10.029
MATT: "That can be procured, yes."

02:27:10.029 --> 02:27:11.057
And he goes and looks over,

02:27:11.057 --> 02:27:13.068
one of the other soldiers has already left.

02:27:13.068 --> 02:27:15.821
And at the mention of hot cocoa being present, you can see

02:27:15.821 --> 02:27:17.501
a number of the soldiers' (swooshing)

02:27:17.501 --> 02:27:20.191
head turn to you.
(laughter)

02:27:20.191 --> 02:27:22.079
You've suddenly become the prettiest belle at the ball.

02:27:22.079 --> 02:27:23.354
(laughter)

02:27:23.354 --> 02:27:25.466
MARISHA: (low voice) Got any extras?
TALIESIN: Yeah, we good.

02:27:25.466 --> 02:27:27.259
I've got enough to make a couple pots.

02:27:27.259 --> 02:27:28.864
SAM: Great, great.

02:27:29.731 --> 02:27:30.847
MATT: Make an insight check for me.

02:27:30.847 --> 02:27:33.041
TALIESIN: Oh, disadvantage.

02:27:33.041 --> 02:27:33.874
MATT: Yep.

02:27:33.874 --> 02:27:35.495
TALIESIN: Hate it all.

02:27:35.495 --> 02:27:36.881
(blowing raspberries)

02:27:36.881 --> 02:27:38.121
13.
(laughter)

02:27:38.121 --> 02:27:41.239
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: That's not <i>horrible</i>.

02:27:44.227 --> 02:27:45.603
MARISHA: (laughs)

02:27:45.603 --> 02:27:46.603
TALIESIN: No.

02:27:48.124 --> 02:27:49.881
You can't--

02:27:49.881 --> 02:27:51.681
Do you have magic that would let you

02:27:52.911 --> 02:27:54.711
see a picture in somebody's mind?

02:27:54.711 --> 02:27:57.121
Like if I had seen something and wanted to show you,

02:27:57.121 --> 02:28:00.011
but couldn't draw very well and just wanted you

02:28:00.011 --> 02:28:02.575
to just see it, is there a thing?

02:28:02.575 --> 02:28:04.041
LAURA: I can draw really well.

02:28:04.041 --> 02:28:07.211
MATT: "I would be able to on the morrow,

02:28:07.211 --> 02:28:09.851
"but at the moment I do not have the capability.

02:28:09.851 --> 02:28:11.286
"My apologies."

02:28:11.286 --> 02:28:12.971
TALIESIN: The thing we saw.

02:28:12.971 --> 02:28:14.351
LAURA: Which one?
SAM: What thing?

02:28:14.351 --> 02:28:15.891
The city?
TALIESIN: The city.

02:28:15.891 --> 02:28:18.411
SAM: Oh, wow, we're going way back for this story.

02:28:18.411 --> 02:28:20.721
TALIESIN: I feel like we need to impress

02:28:20.721 --> 02:28:22.251
the gravity of this situation.

02:28:22.251 --> 02:28:23.442
SAM: What if he already knows?

02:28:23.442 --> 02:28:25.661
MARISHA: That's what I was to say. (sighs)

02:28:25.661 --> 02:28:29.317
LIAM: First, our story is very complicated.

02:28:29.317 --> 02:28:31.421
Why don't you catch us up on what you're doing here?

02:28:31.421 --> 02:28:32.865
<i>How</i> you're doing?

02:28:32.865 --> 02:28:34.541
MATT: "Very well, actually.

02:28:34.541 --> 02:28:36.029
"Walk with me, if you would then."

02:28:36.029 --> 02:28:37.421
MARISHA: Ooh, a walk and talk.
MATT: "If you don't mind."

02:28:37.421 --> 02:28:38.347
And he gives a nod.

02:28:38.347 --> 02:28:39.686
TRAVIS: Isn't there one piece of

02:28:39.686 --> 02:28:40.951
information we should share, though,

02:28:40.951 --> 02:28:43.551
before we sort of catch up on the leisurely?

02:28:43.551 --> 02:28:44.911
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: So good.

02:28:44.911 --> 02:28:47.441
TRAVIS: You know, just in case they try to identify people

02:28:47.441 --> 02:28:49.791
instead of going, if you see these people,

02:28:49.791 --> 02:28:52.206
fuck them up as fast as you can.

02:28:52.206 --> 02:28:53.214
LAURA: Yeah, there's a group.

02:28:53.214 --> 02:28:55.441
TALIESIN: We're being pursued.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:28:55.441 --> 02:28:56.751
MATT: "By whom?"

02:28:56.751 --> 02:28:57.721
TRAVIS: A group of five.

02:28:57.721 --> 02:28:58.810
TALIESIN: Called the Tomb Takers.

02:28:58.810 --> 02:28:59.741
LAURA: Have you heard of them?

02:28:59.741 --> 02:29:01.811
SAM: Did Essek ever meet Mollymauk?

02:29:01.811 --> 02:29:02.811
No.
MARISHA: I don't think so.

02:29:02.811 --> 02:29:03.644
LIAM: No.

02:29:03.644 --> 02:29:05.711
MATT: "I cannot say I'm familiar with this group."

02:29:05.711 --> 02:29:07.324
LAURA: Have you heard of The Nonagon?

02:29:08.541 --> 02:29:09.374
MATT: "No."

02:29:09.374 --> 02:29:11.331
LAURA: Have you heard of the--

02:29:11.331 --> 02:29:13.164
SAM: Somnovum?
LAURA: Somnovum?

02:29:14.619 --> 02:29:16.153
MATT: "I do not believe so."

02:29:16.153 --> 02:29:17.386
SAM and ASHLEY and MARISHA: Insight check!

02:29:17.386 --> 02:29:18.411
SAM: Insight check!

02:29:18.411 --> 02:29:20.322
MATT: Okay!
(laughter)

02:29:20.322 --> 02:29:23.941
MARISHA: We all yelled it. (laughs)

02:29:23.941 --> 02:29:26.151
Okay.
LAURA: Freeze frame. (laughs)

02:29:26.151 --> 02:29:27.776
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

02:29:27.776 --> 02:29:29.524
SAM: 17.

02:29:29.524 --> 02:29:30.646
LIAM: 25.

02:29:30.646 --> 02:29:32.908
SAM: Oh, shit.
MARISHA: 20 total.

02:29:32.908 --> 02:29:34.968
MATT: (laughs) Everyone just goes in on that.

02:29:34.968 --> 02:29:36.493
(laughter)
TRAVIS: Swords out.

02:29:36.493 --> 02:29:38.411
(laughter)

02:29:38.411 --> 02:29:39.481
MATT: And are you rolling?

02:29:39.481 --> 02:29:41.147
TALIESIN: I rolled a one, I'm shutting the fuck up.
MATT: All right, fair enough.

02:29:41.147 --> 02:29:42.216
LIAM: 25, 25.

02:29:43.231 --> 02:29:44.839
MATT: He seems to be on the level.

02:29:44.839 --> 02:29:46.189
He seems to be--

02:29:46.189 --> 02:29:48.461
His curiosity is certainly piqued as to what dragged you

02:29:48.461 --> 02:29:51.511
out in the middle of here, but he did not seem to react

02:29:51.511 --> 02:29:55.837
in some odd or guarded way when you mentioned the phrase.

02:29:55.837 --> 02:29:57.091
TRAVIS: Oh, we are learned.
MARISHA: He's good.

02:29:57.091 --> 02:29:58.961
LAURA: Yeah, what are you doing out here, Essek?

02:29:58.961 --> 02:30:02.611
Don't you know all the horrible things that happened here?

02:30:02.611 --> 02:30:03.921
TALIESIN: If anybody sees them, though,

02:30:03.921 --> 02:30:06.441
they should report before they even engage.

02:30:06.441 --> 02:30:08.721
LAURA: They're led by a guy who's purple and he's covered

02:30:08.721 --> 02:30:10.671
in eyeballs and he's got horns like mine, okay?

02:30:10.671 --> 02:30:13.181
And then, there's like four other people with him.

02:30:13.181 --> 02:30:16.201
One's a cat, one's a halfling,

02:30:16.201 --> 02:30:19.151
one's a big guy, one's-- I don't-- an elf.

02:30:19.151 --> 02:30:21.551
SAM: I'll cast Silent Image and just sort of

02:30:21.551 --> 02:30:24.020
make these people sort of morph into each other.

02:30:24.020 --> 02:30:25.393
MATT: You see Essek raises a finger

02:30:25.393 --> 02:30:27.061
and points towards one of the soldiers,

02:30:27.061 --> 02:30:29.571
who approaches and begins to listen intently.

02:30:29.571 --> 02:30:31.031
LAURA: They are really dangerous.

02:30:31.031 --> 02:30:32.411
They can destroy magic.

02:30:32.411 --> 02:30:35.221
They almost killed all of us.

02:30:35.221 --> 02:30:36.841
TALIESIN: We fought a dragon, and the dragon

02:30:36.841 --> 02:30:39.491
was an easier fight than these people.

02:30:39.491 --> 02:30:40.324
It was a lot.
MATT: You see

02:30:40.324 --> 02:30:42.191
the soldier that Essek called over is not quite

02:30:42.191 --> 02:30:43.491
as armored as some of the other ones

02:30:43.491 --> 02:30:46.061
and has a longer robe and you can see they begin

02:30:46.061 --> 02:30:49.041
to create-- match an illusion to the one

02:30:49.041 --> 02:30:52.386
that's being created here, and the descriptions that

02:30:52.386 --> 02:30:54.591
you're giving as they see crafting visuals of this.

02:30:54.591 --> 02:30:58.251
And Essek gives him a nod and says, "Tell the others."

02:30:58.251 --> 02:31:00.011
And he leaves and you get the sense that he's going

02:31:00.011 --> 02:31:01.911
to inform the rest of the guard at the outpost

02:31:01.911 --> 02:31:02.891
of these people.
TRAVIS: We relay the ability

02:31:02.891 --> 02:31:03.871
to dispel magic,

02:31:03.871 --> 02:31:05.911
all the--
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:31:05.911 --> 02:31:08.501
TALIESIN: And there's enough cocoa that as long as one cup

02:31:08.501 --> 02:31:10.471
gets around to each of these when you're done boiling it,

02:31:10.471 --> 02:31:12.321
whatever's left, feel free to spread around,

02:31:12.321 --> 02:31:14.490
there should be at least 12 cups left.

02:31:14.490 --> 02:31:16.116
Thank you, thank you.
(laughter)

02:31:16.116 --> 02:31:17.699
MATT: "To be rationed!

02:31:19.291 --> 02:31:21.704
"Well, thank you for the heads up on that.

02:31:23.251 --> 02:31:25.001
"Come walk with me for a bit, we can catch up a bit.

02:31:25.001 --> 02:31:29.091
"I'm sorry you are being pursued by these individuals.

02:31:29.091 --> 02:31:31.341
"We shall keep an eye out, I promise you that.

02:31:32.601 --> 02:31:33.891
"I will show you around the outpost."

02:31:33.891 --> 02:31:37.081
And he rises and begins to head towards the door.

02:31:37.081 --> 02:31:38.661
The door opens on its own.

02:31:38.661 --> 02:31:39.794
And do you guys follow?

02:31:39.794 --> 02:31:41.161
LIAM: Yeah.
TALIESIN: (muffled) Oh hell yeah.

02:31:41.161 --> 02:31:42.191
MATT: Okay.

02:31:42.191 --> 02:31:43.621
You head out into the central,

02:31:43.621 --> 02:31:45.141
what would be a thoroughfare. Now that you can see

02:31:45.141 --> 02:31:46.801
this is an outpost and now you're in the middle of it,

02:31:46.801 --> 02:31:48.821
you can see the spires are arranged to create

02:31:48.821 --> 02:31:51.221
a central roadway that passes,

02:31:51.221 --> 02:31:54.738
this curved cluster, where the the main

02:31:54.738 --> 02:31:57.471
back-and-forth between these buildings

02:31:57.471 --> 02:32:00.394
essentially, can be relatively easy and kept.

02:32:01.985 --> 02:32:02.818
And now that you're closer too,

02:32:02.818 --> 02:32:04.261
you can see more of the soldiers that have

02:32:04.261 --> 02:32:05.611
the heavy white cloaks and hoods up,

02:32:05.611 --> 02:32:07.751
that are on top of these spires at different platforms,

02:32:07.751 --> 02:32:10.221
that have heavy ballista-like bolts

02:32:10.221 --> 02:32:13.301
and defensive position weapons that are affixed to it

02:32:13.301 --> 02:32:14.641
that you could not see from a distance

02:32:14.641 --> 02:32:16.501
and are very well hidden, but are definitely capable

02:32:16.501 --> 02:32:19.331
of taking some very dangerous things down,

02:32:19.331 --> 02:32:21.674
should they wander too close to this location.

02:32:22.670 --> 02:32:24.131
Essek, as you guys get close

02:32:24.131 --> 02:32:26.461
and there aren't anybody around, he goes,

02:32:26.461 --> 02:32:28.121
"Apologies, just if we're going to talk a bit,

02:32:28.121 --> 02:32:30.214
"perhaps we should be a little more private.

02:32:31.741 --> 02:32:34.631
"So come, I will show you where my chambers are

02:32:34.631 --> 02:32:36.871
"and, not far from that, perhaps where you might

02:32:36.871 --> 02:32:38.365
"wish to stay for the night."

02:32:38.365 --> 02:32:39.557
LAURA: Oh, wonderful.
TALIESIN: Thank you.

02:32:39.557 --> 02:32:40.390
SAM: Yes.

02:32:40.390 --> 02:32:42.891
MATT: And as he approaches, on the far northern end,

02:32:42.891 --> 02:32:45.301
a door opens and you can see there's a guard out there

02:32:45.301 --> 02:32:48.811
that nods and you are all escorted in.

02:32:48.811 --> 02:32:51.674
This room is small, but comfortable.

02:32:52.781 --> 02:32:54.661
Looking at it, you can see that it seems newer,

02:32:54.661 --> 02:32:55.652
or at least fresher.

02:32:55.652 --> 02:32:58.706
The accoutrements, the decorations of it don't have

02:32:58.706 --> 02:33:02.739
that look of being weathered for a long period of time.

02:33:02.739 --> 02:33:04.989
And as the door closes, you see Essek

02:33:06.106 --> 02:33:08.801
gives a glance and nudges his fingers a bit

02:33:08.801 --> 02:33:10.601
in a direction and looks to you all.

02:33:11.441 --> 02:33:13.241
"All right, the door is silent.

02:33:13.241 --> 02:33:14.451
"No one can hear us through here."

02:33:14.451 --> 02:33:15.371
TRAVIS: Just a moment.

02:33:15.371 --> 02:33:16.321
I'll look around the room.

02:33:16.321 --> 02:33:18.701
And did I see any other invisible sentries

02:33:18.701 --> 02:33:21.071
as we were making our way through all of that?

02:33:21.071 --> 02:33:22.371
Just to get an idea of how many people

02:33:22.371 --> 02:33:25.151
might be cloaked or hidden throughout this entire--

02:33:25.151 --> 02:33:27.621
MATT: Right, you did not see any other invisible sentries.

02:33:27.621 --> 02:33:29.551
The only ones that you saw were in that central chamber.

02:33:29.551 --> 02:33:30.384
TRAVIS: Got it.

02:33:31.759 --> 02:33:32.611
MATT: And you can see there's a lot of things

02:33:32.611 --> 02:33:34.521
being guarded in there, from what you could tell,

02:33:34.521 --> 02:33:36.361
so you're not quite certain if there

02:33:36.361 --> 02:33:37.904
are other ones around, you didn't see any.

02:33:37.904 --> 02:33:39.631
And a lot of them are still cloaked in the sense

02:33:39.631 --> 02:33:43.533
of just keeping visually camouflaged to the environment.

02:33:43.533 --> 02:33:45.591
TRAVIS: Okay, and the room is clear, no orbs?

02:33:45.591 --> 02:33:46.424
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:33:46.424 --> 02:33:48.711
LAURA: We're in Essek's chambers now?

02:33:48.711 --> 02:33:49.544
MATT: You are.

02:33:50.521 --> 02:33:51.584
TRAVIS: Ah, great, 19.

02:33:54.204 --> 02:33:56.420
MATT: Looking around, you don't see anything.

02:33:56.420 --> 02:33:57.253
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:33:59.387 --> 02:34:01.161
MATT: "(sighs)

02:34:01.161 --> 02:34:02.820
"My apologies for that

02:34:06.619 --> 02:34:08.544
"not deception, but--"

02:34:10.874 --> 02:34:12.404
You see he's looking a bit nervous.

02:34:12.404 --> 02:34:15.247
He goes, "You asked me what I'm doing here.

02:34:16.604 --> 02:34:19.067
"I requested this outpost.

02:34:20.244 --> 02:34:22.874
"I needed to be as far away from any sort

02:34:22.874 --> 02:34:26.639
"of central politics after the negotiation."

02:34:26.639 --> 02:34:27.472

02:34:28.376 --> 02:34:29.209
MATT: "Well--"

02:34:30.184 --> 02:34:31.067
SAM: The guilt?

02:34:32.114 --> 02:34:35.602
MATT: "Well, partially, but more so the fact that

"if I am a dangling thread of communication

"at least a dozen assassins out looking for me

"on their regard."
TALIESIN: On both sides, probably.

02:34:52.604 --> 02:34:54.574
MATT: "Hmm?"
LIAM: From our side?

02:34:54.574 --> 02:34:56.044
MATT: "I can only assume so."

02:34:56.044 --> 02:34:58.180
LIAM: Does anyone from yours suspect?

02:35:00.334 --> 02:35:01.217

MATT: "I'm learning as we go,

SAM: So you don't have a specific mission or timetable here?

02:36:09.374 --> 02:36:12.974
It's just to guard, protect, and acquire

02:36:12.974 --> 02:36:16.774
arcane materials?

LIAM: I fear your day-to-day might be

02:36:26.044 --> 02:36:30.564
a little more interesting than you had bargained for soon.

02:36:30.564 --> 02:36:32.667
One question before we dive into--

02:36:33.684 --> 02:36:34.737
there is so much.

02:36:36.244 --> 02:36:37.077
We...

02:36:39.104 --> 02:36:41.364
in recent past have tried

02:36:41.364 --> 02:36:44.534
to send something away from this region.

02:36:44.534 --> 02:36:47.114
I tried to send something

02:36:48.154 --> 02:36:51.727
out of the frozen north.

02:36:53.604 --> 02:36:57.019
We don't know if it reached its destination.

02:36:57.019 --> 02:36:59.162
MATT: "Via translocation?"

02:36:59.162 --> 02:37:00.287
LIAM: Correct.

02:37:03.344 --> 02:37:06.374
Do you have any experience doing such here?

02:37:06.374 --> 02:37:08.598
MATT: "I have. I've been to and from

02:37:08.598 --> 02:37:10.806
"elements of the Dynasty

"It's challenging.

"What were your means of sending this object?"

02:37:20.614 --> 02:37:23.264
LIAM: Well, I had a physical article

02:37:23.264 --> 02:37:26.534
from the location I was trying to send our--

02:37:26.534 --> 02:37:28.614
MATT: "But it was not via circle?"

02:37:28.614 --> 02:37:29.807
LIAM: No.

02:37:29.807 --> 02:37:30.840
More powerful.

02:37:30.840 --> 02:37:31.840
SAM: Not via circle.

02:37:31.840 --> 02:37:32.807
LIAM: Not via circle.

02:37:33.794 --> 02:37:35.137
SAM: Circles are the best?

02:37:36.894 --> 02:37:38.994
MATT: "The magics around here are very strange.

02:37:41.704 --> 02:37:44.704
"Especially at the proximity to these ruins.

02:37:44.704 --> 02:37:49.194
"Any sort of magical incantation has an opportunity to

02:37:52.544 --> 02:37:54.707
"create unexpected consequences.

"But one of the elements that is most affected,

"especially in Eiselcross,

"is translocation, teleportation.

02:38:06.004 --> 02:38:08.534
"What I've learned is the use of a circle

02:38:08.534 --> 02:38:10.894
"having a specific anchor rune

"so the moving away from Aeor seems to be

02:38:18.144 --> 02:38:20.917
"largely unaffected, or at least the safest route.

"Anything beyond that has an increased

"chance of going awry."

02:38:30.674 --> 02:38:32.974
LIAM: So if we were to step away via circle,

02:38:33.874 --> 02:38:36.254
everything is fine, but trying to step back--

02:38:36.254 --> 02:38:39.384
MATT: "As far as I know, yes. I make no extreme guarantees,

"but I have not seen a problem.

SAM: How did you get back?

02:38:47.414 --> 02:38:50.071
You said you went home a few times.

02:38:50.071 --> 02:38:51.204
MATT: "Mm-hmm."

02:38:51.204 --> 02:38:52.574
SAM: How did you return?

02:38:52.574 --> 02:38:55.417
MATT: "The same way I've brought to you around Exandria.

02:39:19.854 --> 02:39:24.854
"underwent some physical stress."

02:39:26.184 --> 02:39:27.734
SAM: Did it like rearrange your body parts

02:39:27.734 --> 02:39:29.867
and put your butt on your front or something?

02:39:30.804 --> 02:39:33.994
MATT: "It might have had it completed its attempts, maybe."

02:39:33.994 --> 02:39:35.514
SAM: Oh shit.
LAURA: Ooh.

02:39:35.514 --> 02:39:38.364
MATT: "But let's just say it can be quite painful

"and the timetable of challenge,

"it could outweigh the dangerous journey here."

02:39:55.906 --> 02:39:58.998
LIAM: Good to know, though,
if we need to beat a hasty retreat,

02:39:58.998 --> 02:40:00.126
we can do so.

02:40:00.126 --> 02:40:03.292
LAURA: Potentially.
LIAM: Coming back is more difficult.

02:40:04.194 --> 02:40:06.544
MATT: "But it is a dangerous place for anyone

02:40:06.544 --> 02:40:09.477
"of intense magical practitioning.

"The proximity of these ruins just makes things

"difficult to prepare for."

02:40:17.904 --> 02:40:21.046
TALIESIN: Is that true of even the most basic magics

02:40:21.046 --> 02:40:21.964
or is it--?

02:40:21.964 --> 02:40:25.054
MATT: "Basic magics can seem to get past

LAURA: Wow.

02:40:40.004 --> 02:40:41.474
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

02:40:41.474 --> 02:40:42.803
LIAM: Okay, understood.

02:40:42.803 --> 02:40:43.636
MARISHA: Through a prism.

02:40:45.524 --> 02:40:48.477
TRAVIS: Well, that allays our most immediate concern.

02:40:50.124 --> 02:40:53.399
MARISHA: Can I get a bead on Essek,

02:40:53.399 --> 02:40:55.849
on if he's, like,

02:40:56.742 --> 02:40:59.314
a little twitchy, a little nervous?

02:40:59.314 --> 02:41:01.144
He mentioned the assassin thing,

02:41:01.144 --> 02:41:03.134
but can I sense if

02:41:05.384 --> 02:41:07.554
there is something he's not letting onto?

02:41:07.554 --> 02:41:08.754
MATT: Make an insight check.

02:41:11.806 --> 02:41:13.434
TRAVIS: Let's go, wisdom!

02:41:13.434 --> 02:41:15.244
MARISHA: That's really good.

02:41:15.244 --> 02:41:17.984
That is really good, 28 total.

02:41:17.984 --> 02:41:18.854
MATT: 28?
TRAVIS: Jesus.

02:41:18.854 --> 02:41:21.474
MARISHA: Yeah, I rolled a natural 19.

02:41:21.474 --> 02:41:23.297
MATT: He seems definitely nervous.

02:41:24.504 --> 02:41:26.627
His nerves both-- you can see him;

02:41:26.627 --> 02:41:28.786
he's instinctually looking over his shoulder

02:41:28.786 --> 02:41:30.084
around him, in a way a person

02:41:30.084 --> 02:41:32.114
who is constantly expecting anything

02:41:32.114 --> 02:41:33.264
to jump out at them is.

02:41:34.344 --> 02:41:37.184
But on top of that, there's also an additional layer.

02:41:37.184 --> 02:41:38.137
With that roll?

02:41:42.393 --> 02:41:43.754
I have no other better way to say it,

02:41:43.754 --> 02:41:44.647
there is shame.

02:41:47.122 --> 02:41:49.004
MARISHA: Shame.

02:41:49.004 --> 02:41:50.824
MATT: He's having a hard time making direct eye contact

02:41:50.824 --> 02:41:52.274
with any of you for too long.

02:41:54.844 --> 02:41:56.928
MARISHA: Wow.
TRAVIS: He kept us in the dark a lot.

02:42:00.814 --> 02:42:04.277
MATT: "Since the Dynasty became aware of--

02:42:06.204 --> 02:42:08.404

02:44:21.964 --> 02:44:24.897
MATT: "So think of the possibilities--"
SAM: Wait, what?

02:44:24.897 --> 02:44:28.511
MATT: "-- of if Aeor at the time--"
LAURA: That's where the Nonagon is.

02:44:28.511 --> 02:44:32.323
MATT: "was unlocking the possibilities of dunamancy

02:44:32.323 --> 02:44:35.214
"before we even began to develop it ourselves.

02:44:35.214 --> 02:44:38.754
"That would be an immense boon to the Dynasty."

02:44:38.754 --> 02:44:39.587
SAM: What, I mean--
LAURA: Yeah!

02:44:39.587 --> 02:44:41.287
SAM: We've seen some of the ruins,

02:44:42.554 --> 02:44:46.737
and it seems like a very alien sort of society.

02:44:48.184 --> 02:44:51.066
Did we see any evidence of Luxon or fate stuff?

02:44:51.066 --> 02:44:54.294
Did we see any evidence of Luxon or fate stuff?

02:44:54.294 --> 02:44:56.604
TRAVIS: We don't know Luxon well enough, I don't think.

02:44:56.604 --> 02:44:57.547
MATT: You didn't encounter anything

02:44:57.547 --> 02:44:58.994
that caught your eye in that way.

02:44:58.994 --> 02:45:01.834
SAM: What evidence did you see, Essek?

02:45:03.259 --> 02:45:04.714
MATT: "Similar symbols," and you see

02:45:04.714 --> 02:45:06.604
he rolls his fingers and you see the--

02:45:06.604 --> 02:45:08.764
He sends a very simple Minor Illusion

02:45:08.764 --> 02:45:11.639
of the dodecahedron, the beacon.

02:45:11.639 --> 02:45:12.855
SAM: Counterspell.

02:45:12.855 --> 02:45:14.620
(laughter)

02:45:14.620 --> 02:45:16.954
MATT: "Well, that's not very sportsmanlike!"

02:45:19.194 --> 02:45:20.174
-of the beacon there.

02:45:20.174 --> 02:45:23.252
He says, "There has been some writing

02:45:23.252 --> 02:45:27.474
"that we've uncovered that is of a beacon's design.

02:45:27.474 --> 02:45:32.104
"As well as discussions of magic in similar realms

02:45:32.104 --> 02:45:35.574
"of what we-- I, myself, study."

02:45:35.574 --> 02:45:38.534
SAM: The beacon's design? As in these things

02:45:38.534 --> 02:45:42.179
were made by man?

02:45:43.234 --> 02:45:45.117
I thought they were gifted by a god or something.

02:45:45.117 --> 02:45:47.614
MATT: "I do not believe that they are made

02:45:47.614 --> 02:45:50.152
"by anyone but the Luxon.

02:45:50.152 --> 02:45:51.244
"They are of the Luxon.

02:45:51.244 --> 02:45:54.004
"But they've been around since the Luxon's

02:45:54.004 --> 02:45:56.554
"been in Exandria, which is the beginning.

02:45:56.554 --> 02:45:59.094
"So it is possible that there may be one

02:45:59.094 --> 02:46:02.124
"or more beacons that they uncovered long before we did.

02:46:02.124 --> 02:46:05.224
"And if that's the case, that brings the Dynasty

02:46:05.224 --> 02:46:08.707
"that much closer to bringing the Luxon together.

02:46:09.764 --> 02:46:11.994
"So this is very much important.

02:46:11.994 --> 02:46:13.744
"And these are only recent findings."

02:46:16.834 --> 02:46:17.677
TRAVIS: Oh, Essek.

02:46:20.294 --> 02:46:23.174
We have so much to catch you up on.

02:46:23.174 --> 02:46:24.214
LIAM: Where to even begin?

02:46:24.214 --> 02:46:28.149
Does it start with "we were fucking about on a volcano," or?

02:46:29.738 --> 02:46:32.654
MARISHA: It's also, like, where does it potentially connect

02:46:32.654 --> 02:46:34.406
and where does it not?

02:46:34.406 --> 02:46:35.744
LAURA: Yeah.

02:46:35.744 --> 02:46:37.364
SAM: I guess we as a group have to decide,

02:46:37.364 --> 02:46:40.974
are we just going to spill all the beans?

02:46:40.974 --> 02:46:42.514
LIAM: Well, something--
SAM: We love this guy, right?

02:46:42.514 --> 02:46:43.744
He's great.

02:46:43.744 --> 02:46:45.854
Even though he's done shitty things, just like us.

02:46:45.854 --> 02:46:46.854
MATT: He's done some real shitty things.

02:46:46.854 --> 02:46:48.744
SAM: But we have too, it's okay.

02:46:48.744 --> 02:46:50.394
TALIESIN: There's no one here who hasn't.

02:46:51.484 --> 02:46:52.364
There's no one here who isn't

02:46:52.364 --> 02:46:54.584
a little embarrassed by something.

02:46:54.584 --> 02:46:56.716
LIAM: Regardless--
MATT: War crimes? Ehh.

02:46:56.716 --> 02:46:59.324
LIAM: Regardless, something is going to happen here,

02:46:59.324 --> 02:47:01.806
potentially soon, something large.

02:47:01.806 --> 02:47:03.790
TRAVIS: Your sabbatical is over.

02:47:05.894 --> 02:47:09.407
LAURA: So a long time ago, before the city crashed,

02:47:10.844 --> 02:47:13.494
there was this group called the Somnovem,

02:47:13.494 --> 02:47:16.344
and they were, like,

02:47:16.344 --> 02:47:18.527
they thought they were smarter than everyone else, right?

02:47:18.527 --> 02:47:19.914
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: Mm-hmm.

02:47:19.914 --> 02:47:21.704
LAURA: And they figured out what was happening

02:47:21.704 --> 02:47:24.544
and they decided to save their section of the city.

02:47:24.544 --> 02:47:27.334
They said they were going to send it away to make it safe.

02:47:27.334 --> 02:47:29.067
SAM: The Cognouza Ward.

02:47:29.067 --> 02:47:29.900
LAURA: Yes.

02:47:29.900 --> 02:47:31.597
MATT: "I've read of such a place."

02:47:32.854 --> 02:47:34.644
LAURA: So they succeeded,

02:47:34.644 --> 02:47:36.374
but what they ended up doing was sending

02:47:36.374 --> 02:47:39.767
that portion of the city to the Astral Sea.

02:47:41.104 --> 02:47:41.937
I think.

02:47:43.974 --> 02:47:48.974
And this city has been there for a thousand years

02:47:50.574 --> 02:47:54.034
becoming something completely different.

02:47:54.034 --> 02:47:56.019
It's alive.

02:47:57.200 --> 02:47:58.134
It's tortured.

02:47:58.134 --> 02:48:01.654
It's just pure hatred and evil and

02:48:03.504 --> 02:48:06.974
has no desire but to devour everything.

02:48:06.974 --> 02:48:08.534
LIAM: We've seen it.

02:48:08.534 --> 02:48:09.781
All of us, in visions.

02:48:09.781 --> 02:48:11.064
TALIESIN: It's seen us.

02:48:11.064 --> 02:48:13.304
MARISHA: This whole time, I am deeply staring

02:48:13.304 --> 02:48:16.334
at every twitch that happens in his face.

02:48:16.334 --> 02:48:18.106
TRAVIS: Not very subtly.

02:48:18.106 --> 02:48:20.654
(chuckles)

02:48:20.654 --> 02:48:22.562
MARISHA: (laughs)

02:48:24.474 --> 02:48:25.674
MATT: Make an insight check.

02:48:26.694 --> 02:48:27.587
As we progress.

02:48:29.004 --> 02:48:31.446
MARISHA: That's an 18 so 27.

02:48:31.446 --> 02:48:32.279
MATT: Okay.

02:48:34.084 --> 02:48:35.584
He's listening intently still.

02:48:36.564 --> 02:48:40.779
LAURA: There's a group of people, the Tomb Takers,

02:48:43.124 --> 02:48:46.534
who desire to bring this portion of the city

02:48:46.534 --> 02:48:48.527
back to Exandria.

02:48:49.599 --> 02:48:50.549
MATT: "For what purpose?"

02:48:53.944 --> 02:48:55.302
TALIESIN: They've been driven mad.

02:48:55.302 --> 02:48:56.150
TRAVIS: They want to join.

02:48:56.150 --> 02:48:58.684
TALIESIN: They want to bring the madness.

02:48:58.684 --> 02:49:00.094
It's just madness.

02:49:00.094 --> 02:49:00.927
LAURA: Power?

02:49:04.861 --> 02:49:08.527
The voices, the voices can reach you.

02:49:10.144 --> 02:49:12.254
I don't know as well as Beau and Caleb

02:49:12.254 --> 02:49:13.591
what that is like, but--

02:49:16.874 --> 02:49:18.492
TALIESIN: Are we going to put everything on the table?

02:49:18.492 --> 02:49:19.775
TRAVIS: Not that part.

02:49:24.154 --> 02:49:27.224
LIAM: Our understanding of this is rudimentary at best,

02:49:28.154 --> 02:49:33.109
but these Tomb Takers, this purple one we have mentioned,

02:49:34.476 --> 02:49:39.442
believes that he can achieve all his dreams

02:49:40.684 --> 02:49:45.194
if he brings this city of dreamers
back into the world, we think.

02:49:45.194 --> 02:49:47.414
Anyway, we have been at odds with them

02:49:47.414 --> 02:49:50.014
for the past few weeks

02:49:50.014 --> 02:49:53.138
here in Eiselcross, running around.

02:49:54.314 --> 02:49:57.507
LAURA: They're seeking large crests.

02:49:59.134 --> 02:50:01.314
That's one of the things we sent away.

02:50:01.314 --> 02:50:03.112
LIAM: These large gems that we believe were part

02:50:03.112 --> 02:50:06.114
of the construction of the city of Aeor.

02:50:06.114 --> 02:50:07.517
MATT: "Threshold crests, you mean?"

02:50:07.517 --> 02:50:08.851
TALIESIN: Yes.
LIAM: Our best guess is that

02:50:08.851 --> 02:50:11.434
they will be used to somehow--

02:50:11.434 --> 02:50:13.634
SAM: Bring the city back.
LIAM: -- open a door, <i>ja</i>.

02:50:15.054 --> 02:50:18.337
LAURA: Have you heard anything about the Nine Eyes?

02:50:21.227 --> 02:50:24.694
MATT: "I do not, but if from what you say of this,

02:50:26.974 --> 02:50:31.974
"this city of dreams is a malevolent force

02:50:32.184 --> 02:50:34.134
"and they seek to bring it back? That is--

02:50:38.114 --> 02:50:40.220
"that is a dire warning."

02:50:41.596 --> 02:50:43.477
And so you're reading him on this.

02:50:46.044 --> 02:50:47.224
He's intently listening

02:50:48.094 --> 02:50:51.624
and seems to be genuinely disturbed

02:50:51.624 --> 02:50:54.029
by the information that he's received.

02:50:54.029 --> 02:50:55.057
MARISHA: Okay.

02:50:55.057 --> 02:50:56.804
MATT: He's taking it in, he's very controlled.

02:50:56.804 --> 02:50:59.204
Like he's used to listening and, you know.

02:50:59.204 --> 02:51:01.774
His demeanor since you met him has been very constructed.

02:51:01.774 --> 02:51:03.627
It is very much an element that he

02:51:03.627 --> 02:51:04.974
instinctually puts forward.

02:51:04.974 --> 02:51:06.164
But even in that space you could see him

02:51:06.164 --> 02:51:07.884
being very contemplative

02:51:07.884 --> 02:51:10.957
and trying to just take it all in and nod.

02:51:13.974 --> 02:51:15.164
TALIESIN: We wouldn't have brought this to you

02:51:15.164 --> 02:51:16.657
if we didn't have to, and--

02:51:19.874 --> 02:51:21.874
not for a lack of trust, you are a friend,

02:51:21.874 --> 02:51:24.394
but we understand how these sorts

02:51:24.394 --> 02:51:26.674
of problems weigh on you particularly and--

02:51:26.674 --> 02:51:27.774
MATT: He puts his hand up.

02:51:27.774 --> 02:51:30.627
"I've spent so much of my life focused on myself,

02:51:31.834 --> 02:51:34.707
"my climb, all of my selfish needs.

02:51:35.624 --> 02:51:38.014
"I've never really been trusted and so I did not trust.

02:51:38.014 --> 02:51:41.137
"And I never let anyone close.

02:51:46.634 --> 02:51:50.604
"I have been clouded in my judgment many times

02:51:50.604 --> 02:51:52.121
"for a lot of my life.

02:51:57.855 --> 02:52:01.888
"When I-- when you gave me trust,

02:52:04.934 --> 02:52:09.327
"it gave me a perspective that was so agonizingly striking.

02:52:15.154 --> 02:52:18.264
"So easy to see that I refused to acknowledge it

02:52:18.264 --> 02:52:19.807
"at first, even.

02:52:26.259 --> 02:52:28.152
"I would be lying if I said that

02:52:31.954 --> 02:52:36.764
"our paths crossing hasn't shaken me

02:52:36.764 --> 02:52:38.330
"to the core.

02:52:40.124 --> 02:52:41.354
"And I'm appreciative."

02:52:42.324 --> 02:52:44.444
LIAM: I'll insight check that.

02:52:44.444 --> 02:52:45.277
MATT: Go for it.

02:52:48.163 --> 02:52:48.996
LIAM: (pop)

02:52:48.996 --> 02:52:50.464
(laughter)

02:52:50.464 --> 02:52:51.297
MATT: Hard to read.

02:52:55.757 --> 02:52:57.874
"And I'm thankful for this perspective,

02:52:59.734 --> 02:53:02.447
"but you do not owe me trust for what I've done."

02:53:02.447 --> 02:53:04.524
MARISHA: No, we definitely don't.

02:53:04.524 --> 02:53:09.154
And we still don't really trust you.

02:53:09.154 --> 02:53:10.094
MATT: "Good."

02:53:10.094 --> 02:53:11.268
LIAM: But maybe.

02:53:12.144 --> 02:53:13.104
MARISHA: Jester does.

02:53:13.104 --> 02:53:14.734
LIAM: We have a chance for you to do something good

02:53:14.734 --> 02:53:15.567
for your home.

02:53:17.584 --> 02:53:19.314
Instead of hurt it.

02:53:19.314 --> 02:53:21.014
Something is going to happen here.

02:53:22.037 --> 02:53:23.004
We don't know what.

02:53:24.754 --> 02:53:26.647
Something almost definitely bad.

02:53:29.204 --> 02:53:32.654
Do you want to aid us here with these people coming

02:53:32.654 --> 02:53:34.204
to do what they're going to do?

02:53:39.904 --> 02:53:40.974
MATT: "Whether or not I help you,

02:53:40.974 --> 02:53:43.524
"there is a reckoning that will find me soon enough.

02:53:44.408 --> 02:53:46.246
"I know that--

02:53:47.837 --> 02:53:49.854
"I know that I exist on borrowed time.

02:53:51.396 --> 02:53:53.364
"And my short-sightedness has had

02:53:53.364 --> 02:53:56.022
"far-reaching impacts

02:53:56.022 --> 02:53:58.414
"that my selfishness prevented me from seeing.

02:54:04.507 --> 02:54:07.641
"So whatever I can do with the time that I do have,

02:54:10.574 --> 02:54:11.407
"I will try.

02:54:12.554 --> 02:54:14.784
"I am responsible for the people at this outpost,

02:54:14.784 --> 02:54:16.747
"but I also wish to help

02:54:18.204 --> 02:54:20.354
"in whatever way I can."

02:54:20.354 --> 02:54:23.604
LAURA: If we succeed and we all, you know,

02:54:23.604 --> 02:54:26.888
destroy the Tomb Takers and Essek helps us

02:54:26.888 --> 02:54:29.515
and the world is saved,

02:54:29.515 --> 02:54:33.384
maybe we can take Essek with us and use that spell

02:54:33.384 --> 02:54:36.112
that you used on Veth and then we can change Essek

02:54:36.112 --> 02:54:38.412
into something else so that the assassins can't find him

02:54:38.412 --> 02:54:40.677
and he'll live safely wherever he goes.

02:54:43.337 --> 02:54:45.587
LIAM: That won't really help with the inside.

02:54:46.834 --> 02:54:48.864
MATT: You see him smile and he's--

02:54:48.864 --> 02:54:50.664
since you've been here Essek's still,

02:54:51.522 --> 02:54:55.584
while challenged to hold eye contact with most of you

02:54:55.584 --> 02:54:58.455
<i>cannot</i> make eye contact with Caleb.

02:55:00.934 --> 02:55:04.277
But as Caleb says that, the head sinks a bit with a nod.

02:55:07.834 --> 02:55:11.340
"I appreciate the insinuation.

02:55:16.394 --> 02:55:17.227
"Anyway.

02:55:23.614 --> 02:55:24.714
"What can I do to help?

02:55:26.484 --> 02:55:28.294
"Who did-- who else knows this?

02:55:28.294 --> 02:55:29.127
"What's--?"

02:55:30.334 --> 02:55:31.704
TRAVIS: You.

02:55:31.704 --> 02:55:33.724
You know this.

02:55:33.724 --> 02:55:36.144
Some members within the Cobalt Soul, but not enough.

02:55:36.144 --> 02:55:37.487
TALIESIN: We had--

02:55:38.564 --> 02:55:42.907
we originally came here in the company of-- well.

02:55:44.434 --> 02:55:45.414
Oh boy.

02:55:45.414 --> 02:55:47.014
TRAVIS: Oh, has Dagen arrived?

02:55:47.014 --> 02:55:48.684
SAM: Oh shit.
LAURA: Oh my god.

02:55:48.684 --> 02:55:51.064
SAM: Hey, you should tell your guards

02:55:51.064 --> 02:55:52.744
if he hasn't already arrived,

02:55:52.744 --> 02:55:56.457
if a man comes in on wheels, don't kill him.

02:55:57.363 --> 02:55:58.337
MATT: "Very well, I'll let--"

02:55:58.337 --> 02:56:00.787
At that point you start hearing some loud whistles outside

02:56:01.794 --> 02:56:05.339
and all of a sudden you hear some other shouts.

02:56:05.339 --> 02:56:06.172
LIAM: Ow!

02:56:06.172 --> 02:56:08.622
SAM: Hey, we just killed a guy on wheels!

02:56:09.516 --> 02:56:12.954
MATT: Essek leans forward--
LIAM: Missed it by that much.

02:56:12.954 --> 02:56:15.604
MATT: -- and the door opens on its own

02:56:15.604 --> 02:56:18.924
and he rushes out. "Oh no."

02:56:18.924 --> 02:56:21.324
And you see him glide out into the open space.

02:56:21.324 --> 02:56:23.300
TRAVIS: We're going right after.
MARISHA: Hey, what's going on? Hey!

02:56:23.300 --> 02:56:24.632
LAURA: Are you going to-- Beau?

02:56:24.632 --> 02:56:26.034
SAM: I'm going to quickly finish my hot cocoa.

02:56:26.034 --> 02:56:28.030
TRAVIS: You hope it's Dagen. Let's go.

02:56:28.030 --> 02:56:31.344
TALIESIN: We haven't gotten our hot cocoa yet.
MARISHA: I don't know yet.

02:56:31.344 --> 02:56:33.904
MATT: You all dart out and in the middle of the street,

02:56:33.904 --> 02:56:35.104
you can see there's a number of guards

02:56:35.104 --> 02:56:36.504
that have their weapons up

02:56:36.504 --> 02:56:41.124
and there off to the side, you see Dagen there,

02:56:41.124 --> 02:56:44.174
cloak up, an Aurora Watch soldier in his lap

02:56:44.174 --> 02:56:46.694
with his arm around the back of the shoulder

02:56:46.694 --> 02:56:48.464
and he's just holding up this letter and saying,

02:56:48.464 --> 02:56:52.208
"I told you I was sent here by a friend."

02:56:52.208 --> 02:56:53.214
TRAVIS: Don't shoot, don't shoot!

02:56:53.214 --> 02:56:55.484
He's with us. Sorry!

02:56:55.484 --> 02:56:58.244
Sorry, communication.

02:56:58.244 --> 02:57:00.890
MATT: Essek puts his hands up as well and says,

02:57:00.890 --> 02:57:03.554
"Let the man go, it's all right."

02:57:03.554 --> 02:57:05.324
One of the other soldiers goes,

02:57:05.324 --> 02:57:07.674
"Lot of strange figures coming in today."

02:57:09.324 --> 02:57:10.564
And Dagen lets go of the guard

02:57:10.564 --> 02:57:11.824
and gives them a shove off to the side.

02:57:11.824 --> 02:57:14.044
He stumbles a bit and rights himself and goes,

02:57:15.354 --> 02:57:19.224
"All right, you all need to tighten up the outside here

02:57:19.224 --> 02:57:21.454
"'cause if it wasn't hard for me to get in here,

02:57:21.454 --> 02:57:23.544
"it's not going to be hard for others."

02:57:23.544 --> 02:57:25.304
You see some of the other Aurora Watch

02:57:25.304 --> 02:57:28.104
get a little like frustrated at the connotation.

02:57:28.104 --> 02:57:29.286
SAM: Essek?
TALIESIN: He's not wrong.

02:57:29.286 --> 02:57:32.234
SAM: I don't expect this to happen, but if a yeti

02:57:32.234 --> 02:57:34.764
named Gestaf shows up, also let him through.

02:57:34.764 --> 02:57:36.604
Just throwing that out there.

02:57:36.604 --> 02:57:38.744
MATT: Four or five of the guards turn their heads at once

02:57:38.744 --> 02:57:39.577
and Essek goes,

02:57:42.054 --> 02:57:44.444
"Be mindful of the yetis as well, but--"

02:57:44.444 --> 02:57:46.824
SAM: Any yeti's probably okay. Okay?

02:57:46.824 --> 02:57:47.893
MATT: "Do not listen."

02:57:47.893 --> 02:57:50.060
(laughter)

02:57:51.274 --> 02:57:55.234
Dagen goes, "Well, I came here to deliver a letter,

02:57:55.234 --> 02:57:57.294
"but it seems you beat me here."

02:57:57.294 --> 02:58:00.094
TALIESIN: Things got difficult.
LAURA: Messy.

02:58:00.094 --> 02:58:01.764
MARISHA: Glad to see you alive.

02:58:01.764 --> 02:58:03.837
MATT: "Fair enough. You as well, you as well.

02:58:04.704 --> 02:58:06.652
"I take it you're the individual?

02:58:06.652 --> 02:58:08.744
"I'm Dagen Underthorn.

02:58:09.704 --> 02:58:10.954
"Only been through here a few times,

02:58:10.954 --> 02:58:12.454
"but I don't think we have met."

02:58:13.494 --> 02:58:14.624
Some of the soldiers look around

02:58:14.624 --> 02:58:17.714
and Essek goes, "Well, pleasure to make your acquaintance.

02:58:17.714 --> 02:58:20.137
"Mutual friends makes us friends for now.

02:58:22.334 --> 02:58:24.334
TRAVIS: Dagen, because you were behind us,

02:58:24.334 --> 02:58:26.924
did you manage to keep an eye on,

02:58:26.924 --> 02:58:29.504
I don't know, the five members of the party

02:58:29.504 --> 02:58:30.977
that was in hot pursuit?

02:58:32.534 --> 02:58:34.471
MATT: "I went on the path you told me."

02:58:34.471 --> 02:58:35.526
TRAVIS: Yeah, no, that's true.

02:58:35.526 --> 02:58:37.104
MATT: "Bit of a snow storm. I had to keep my nose

02:58:37.104 --> 02:58:39.874
"to the grindstone to get out here in time.

02:58:39.874 --> 02:58:42.044
"So no, sorry."

02:58:42.044 --> 02:58:44.044
TRAVIS: Essek, as a bit of warning,

02:58:44.044 --> 02:58:47.074
the northwestern corner of Aeor

02:58:47.074 --> 02:58:49.044
this group that we've told you is on their way,

02:58:49.044 --> 02:58:51.444
they're meaning to exploit a hidden entrance

02:58:51.444 --> 02:58:53.294
into the city, northwestern corner.

02:58:53.294 --> 02:58:54.584
I-- we don't know where it is,

02:58:54.584 --> 02:58:56.414
but if you have a scouting party

02:58:56.414 --> 02:58:59.374
or a perimeter guard that might stock up

02:58:59.374 --> 02:59:03.036
or see about that area it could be of benefit.

02:59:03.036 --> 02:59:05.354
MATT: "I'll task a crew to go ahead and look for it.

02:59:05.354 --> 02:59:07.754
"I do not recall at least within my knowledge

02:59:07.754 --> 02:59:09.584
"of such a place, but I'm certain there are

02:59:09.584 --> 02:59:13.034
"many hidden entrances to the ruins all over the place.

02:59:13.034 --> 02:59:14.034
"I'll do my best."

02:59:14.034 --> 02:59:16.604
TRAVIS: We should have a week by our estimates,

02:59:16.604 --> 02:59:18.927
but we've been wrong before.

02:59:19.834 --> 02:59:21.204
TALIESIN: They are very creative.

02:59:21.204 --> 02:59:23.054
SAM: And do you have detailed maps

02:59:23.054 --> 02:59:24.829
that we could take a look at

02:59:24.829 --> 02:59:26.684
about, you know, once you get down

02:59:26.684 --> 02:59:29.159
into Aeor, where the ruins--

02:59:29.159 --> 02:59:30.374
TALIESIN: What's down there?

02:59:30.374 --> 02:59:32.104
SAM: Huh? Yeah.

02:59:32.104 --> 02:59:33.724
TALIESIN: We don't know what's down there.

02:59:33.724 --> 02:59:36.135
MATT: "Well, there's quite a bit down there.

02:59:37.834 --> 02:59:42.574
"I've only been in myself a bit, but we can go over that.

02:59:42.574 --> 02:59:45.174
"I take it this individual is indeed a friend

02:59:45.174 --> 02:59:46.767
"or at least under your employ?"

02:59:47.672 --> 02:59:48.505
LAURA: Yes.

02:59:48.505 --> 02:59:49.338
TRAVIS: Very much so.
SAM: Oh, Dagen? Yes.

02:59:49.338 --> 02:59:50.171
LAURA: Yes, yes.

02:59:50.171 --> 02:59:52.254
MATT: "And you are to be staying how long?"

02:59:52.254 --> 02:59:55.647
And Dagen goes, "Well, I was just here to relay a message.

02:59:59.774 --> 03:00:01.197
"I can head back."

03:00:02.774 --> 03:00:05.177
TALIESIN: You know who we're expecting, so.

03:00:06.084 --> 03:00:08.264
If you want to stay and help with that, we would be--

03:00:08.264 --> 03:00:09.694
TRAVIS: You know, Essek--
MATT: "Yeah, if you're paying enough."

03:00:09.694 --> 03:00:11.964
TRAVIS: -- he's a fantastic hand.

03:00:11.964 --> 03:00:13.844
He is, however, quite expensive,

03:00:13.844 --> 03:00:16.094
but I assure you, for the Dynasty,

03:00:16.094 --> 03:00:18.174
it would be an investment well-spent.

03:00:18.174 --> 03:00:19.844
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

03:00:19.844 --> 03:00:21.032
TRAVIS: I'm good at those.

03:00:21.032 --> 03:00:22.207
MARISHA: Come on, come on.

03:00:22.207 --> 03:00:23.165
TRAVIS: 19.

03:00:23.165 --> 03:00:24.246
MARISHA and LIAM: Yeah.

03:00:24.246 --> 03:00:25.394
MATT: Your total's 19 or you rolled--

03:00:25.394 --> 03:00:27.442
TRAVIS: Total of 19.
MATT: Total 19.

03:00:27.442 --> 03:00:29.084
Essek scratches his chin and looks over

03:00:29.084 --> 03:00:31.284
to one of the more well-armored individuals.

03:00:34.534 --> 03:00:35.654
"Speak with this individual,

03:00:35.654 --> 03:00:38.187
"this Mr. Underthorn, and

03:00:39.684 --> 03:00:42.414
"test his skills a bit, see if perhaps there is

03:00:42.414 --> 03:00:46.644
"use for another mercenary on the payroll.

03:00:46.644 --> 03:00:48.744
"I take it to you are not affiliated

03:00:48.744 --> 03:00:52.747
"with any specific political interests?"

03:00:53.744 --> 03:00:55.254
And gives a really tight,

03:00:55.254 --> 03:00:57.627
intense look onto Dagen and Dagen goes,

03:00:59.094 --> 03:01:02.470
"Look, friend, I roll wherever they pay me."

03:01:04.414 --> 03:01:05.767
ASHLEY: He's the best.

03:01:05.767 --> 03:01:06.600
MATT: "Very well."

03:01:07.651 --> 03:01:10.607
You watch the other more--

03:01:11.444 --> 03:01:12.954
you can already tell this is one

03:01:12.954 --> 03:01:14.524
of the local captains or somebody

03:01:14.524 --> 03:01:17.154
of some authority here that ends up taking Dagen off

03:01:17.154 --> 03:01:19.184
and they begin discussing.

03:01:19.184 --> 03:01:21.626
Essek turns back to you, the rest of you.

03:01:23.614 --> 03:01:28.544
"So yes, there is a matter of looking into these ruins.

03:01:28.544 --> 03:01:31.939
"You say you have some time

03:01:31.939 --> 03:01:34.319
"before these individuals come and chase you down?"

03:01:34.319 --> 03:01:36.584
LAURA: Hopefully. I think they're probably going to go

03:01:36.584 --> 03:01:39.003
to another ruin first.

03:01:39.003 --> 03:01:40.019
TRAVIS: We can share what we know.

03:01:40.019 --> 03:01:44.195
Your brain will be of extreme use in this situation.

03:01:44.195 --> 03:01:45.504
TALIESIN: Extreme.
MATT: "Very well."

03:01:45.504 --> 03:01:47.724
LIAM: We'll tell you about our--
MARISHA: Can we get back--

03:01:47.724 --> 03:01:49.094
LIAM: You go ahead, Beauregard.

03:01:49.094 --> 03:01:51.034
MARISHA: Just wanted to get out of the thoroughfare,

03:01:51.034 --> 03:01:52.624
get back into a quiet spot.

03:01:52.624 --> 03:01:53.874
MATT: "Indeed. Follow me."

03:01:53.874 --> 03:01:55.461
MARISHA: Thank you.

03:01:55.461 --> 03:01:58.211
MATT: You all head back into his chambers, the door closes.

03:01:59.606 --> 03:02:01.174
LAURA: Caleb?
LIAM: Yes?

03:02:01.174 --> 03:02:02.552
TALIESIN: Also say there's-- oh.

03:02:02.552 --> 03:02:05.634
LAURA: Caleb, you should get naked.

03:02:05.634 --> 03:02:07.244
TRAVIS: What?
LIAM: To do what?

03:02:07.244 --> 03:02:08.344
LAURA: You should show him.

03:02:09.276 --> 03:02:11.374
SAM: Oh.
LIAM: Oh.

03:02:11.374 --> 03:02:12.251
TRAVIS: You're talking about--

03:02:12.251 --> 03:02:13.864
TALIESIN: Do we know about your diary, by the way?

03:02:13.864 --> 03:02:15.704
SAM: His dick.

03:02:15.704 --> 03:02:16.804
TALIESIN: Do we know that you--?

03:02:17.765 --> 03:02:18.619
MARISHA: You all?

03:02:18.619 --> 03:02:21.424
LIAM: This is a very small room.

03:02:21.424 --> 03:02:22.424
LAURA: We've all seen it.

03:02:23.649 --> 03:02:24.482
(laughter)

03:02:24.482 --> 03:02:25.799
SAM: It's above average.

03:02:27.574 --> 03:02:29.254
TRAVIS: What are we talking about?

03:02:29.254 --> 03:02:30.394
LIAM: I'm losing track.

03:02:30.394 --> 03:02:31.614
MATT: "What's are we talking about?!?"

03:02:31.614 --> 03:02:32.921
TALIESIN: It's entirely-- well.

03:02:32.921 --> 03:02:34.593
MARISHA: Let's reset.
LAURA: This is important.

03:02:34.593 --> 03:02:35.917
MARISHA: Let's reset.

03:02:35.917 --> 03:02:37.976
TRAVIS: Beau can show hers, too.

03:02:37.976 --> 03:02:39.385
(laughter)

03:02:39.385 --> 03:02:42.203
LIAM: Let's return, let's return to

03:02:43.046 --> 03:02:46.964
the purple one.
MARISHA: Let's reset.

03:02:46.964 --> 03:02:47.797
TALIESIN: Okay.

03:02:48.784 --> 03:02:52.634
LIAM: So this individual goes by the name of Lucien.

03:02:52.634 --> 03:02:55.804
We traveled with him in the past.

03:02:55.804 --> 03:02:57.754
He was a different person at that time.

03:02:58.644 --> 03:02:59.477
Hard to explain.

03:03:00.754 --> 03:03:01.587
LAURA: It's almost like,

03:03:01.587 --> 03:03:05.044
it's almost like the beacons, right?

03:03:05.044 --> 03:03:07.014
SAM: Oh, oh yes.

03:03:07.014 --> 03:03:09.315
One's soul can jump from one body to another.

03:03:09.315 --> 03:03:10.990
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: There's always been a

03:03:10.990 --> 03:03:15.062
striking resemblance, but something bastardized about it.

03:03:17.284 --> 03:03:20.137
Doesn't feel as charming or as warm or as welcoming.

03:03:24.574 --> 03:03:26.182
LIAM: This individual--

03:03:26.182 --> 03:03:27.614
there are so many things to talk about.

03:03:27.614 --> 03:03:29.834
One, he makes all things magical

03:03:29.834 --> 03:03:31.767
wilt like a flower in flame.

03:03:32.634 --> 03:03:34.014
You need to be very careful.

03:03:34.014 --> 03:03:37.404
You need to stay spaced out when you are dealing with

03:03:37.404 --> 03:03:39.664
he and his cohorts if you run into them.

03:03:39.664 --> 03:03:40.745
Do not clump up.

03:03:41.999 --> 03:03:44.567
TALIESIN: He can see through illusions. He can--

03:03:44.567 --> 03:03:46.774
LIAM: He can see just about anything.

03:03:46.774 --> 03:03:48.314
TALIESIN: He doesn't sleep.

03:03:48.314 --> 03:03:49.737
LAURA: He doesn't sleep!

03:03:51.046 --> 03:03:52.781
MARISHA: He drained the life force out of me.

03:03:52.781 --> 03:03:54.714
LAURA: He says he dreams while he's awake.

03:03:56.064 --> 03:04:00.294
TALIESIN: He blinded many of us.

03:04:00.294 --> 03:04:03.914
LIAM: So we've been-- oh, go ahead.

03:04:03.914 --> 03:04:05.422
TRAVIS: We relay all the effects.

03:04:05.422 --> 03:04:06.323
TALIESIN: Yeah, the damage.
MATT: Right, right.

03:04:06.323 --> 03:04:07.156
TALIESIN: Et cetera.

03:04:07.156 --> 03:04:08.982
MATT: He's getting those noticeably more and more

03:04:08.982 --> 03:04:11.774
anxious with each progressive element

03:04:11.774 --> 03:04:15.351
you stack onto the description of this dangerous entity.

03:04:15.351 --> 03:04:17.411
TRAVIS: Telepathically communicated.

03:04:17.411 --> 03:04:18.686
MARISHA: Giving a description.

03:04:18.686 --> 03:04:20.079
MATT: "And this individual--"

03:04:20.079 --> 03:04:21.757
MARISHA: He had a John Deere hat,

03:04:21.757 --> 03:04:25.764
and red Ford, red Ford pickup.

03:04:25.764 --> 03:04:27.095
TRAVIS: All right, Kentucky.

03:04:27.095 --> 03:04:29.711
(laughter)

03:04:29.711 --> 03:04:31.774
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: "And this Lucien,

03:04:31.774 --> 03:04:36.774
"this Lucien is just a pawn in releasing

03:04:38.774 --> 03:04:42.037
"this Aeorian Somnovem?"

03:04:42.037 --> 03:04:43.770
TALIESIN: He calls himself the Nonagon.

03:04:44.954 --> 03:04:47.294
SAM: Connected to the Somnovem somehow,

03:04:47.294 --> 03:04:48.844
empowered by them

03:04:48.844 --> 03:04:53.834
and also granted powers

03:04:53.834 --> 03:04:55.994
by the knowledge of them

03:04:55.994 --> 03:05:00.481
that manifest in eyes tattooed across his body that have--

03:05:00.481 --> 03:05:03.501
MATT: "And you feel confident that this is not beyond you?

03:05:03.501 --> 03:05:05.584
"Or us?"

03:05:05.584 --> 03:05:07.434
LAURA: Oh, no.
MARISHA: Oh, no, it's beyond us.

03:05:07.434 --> 03:05:08.750
LAURA: That's why we're here.
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:05:08.750 --> 03:05:10.684
LAURA: We need your help.
TALIESIN: No idea.

03:05:10.684 --> 03:05:13.217
MATT: "I do not know if I can offer enough help--

03:05:13.217 --> 03:05:14.900
LAURA: You're so strong, Essek.

03:05:14.900 --> 03:05:16.058
SAM: The strongest.
LAURA: You're so powerful.

03:05:16.058 --> 03:05:19.384
TRAVIS: No, to be clear, you are as fucked as we are.

03:05:19.384 --> 03:05:20.654
Let's let's be clear:

03:05:20.654 --> 03:05:24.994
numbers help, preparation helps, distance helps.

03:05:24.994 --> 03:05:27.664
SAM: And the element of--

03:05:27.664 --> 03:05:29.294
we're on defense now, right?

03:05:29.294 --> 03:05:31.224
If we get into Aeor,

03:05:31.224 --> 03:05:33.974
possibly even find their secret entrance,

03:05:33.974 --> 03:05:38.974
we could set up some sort of perimeter or defensive--

03:05:39.354 --> 03:05:42.052
MATT: "Do you know where they're going within the ruins?"

03:05:42.052 --> 03:05:43.934
SAM: No.
LAURA: I assume they're going to where--

03:05:43.934 --> 03:05:45.774
what was it called?

03:05:45.774 --> 03:05:46.904
The city area.

03:05:46.904 --> 03:05:49.074
SAM: Oh, well that area is gone.

03:05:49.074 --> 03:05:50.420
LAURA: Yeah, but generally.

03:05:50.420 --> 03:05:53.909
SAM: What would have been the Cognouza Ward?

03:05:53.909 --> 03:05:56.366
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: They needed two lodestones.

03:05:56.366 --> 03:06:01.114
Two of which we've recovered
from previous archeological sites.

03:06:01.114 --> 03:06:03.244
We got rid of one, so they're going to receive

03:06:03.244 --> 03:06:06.324
a second now from another on a map. I could show you,

03:06:06.324 --> 03:06:08.244
they took ours.

03:06:08.244 --> 03:06:09.984
LAURA: They took a lot of our stuff.

03:06:09.984 --> 03:06:11.764
They stole our bags.

03:06:11.764 --> 03:06:14.054
TRAVIS: We're assuming they need at least the two,

03:06:14.054 --> 03:06:16.264
possibly a third located here or more

03:06:16.264 --> 03:06:19.524
to summon this living city.

03:06:19.524 --> 03:06:22.132
MARISHA: You have--
MATT: "Well, two-- hmm.

03:06:24.204 --> 03:06:26.167
"Threshold crests are--

03:06:27.824 --> 03:06:31.144
"There is a ritualistic binding

03:06:31.144 --> 03:06:34.287
"of such objects to a location.

03:06:35.584 --> 03:06:38.897
"They are rare and they are generally relics from long ago.

03:06:40.744 --> 03:06:42.794
"Those that exist still have largely been broken

03:06:42.794 --> 03:06:45.254
"and separated across Exandria,

03:06:45.254 --> 03:06:50.113
"but to have ones that were originally within Aeor

03:06:50.113 --> 03:06:53.584
"were it meant to translocate the city throughout Exandria."

03:06:56.542 --> 03:06:57.750
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

03:06:59.064 --> 03:07:01.655
MATT: "But they must be bound to something

03:07:01.655 --> 03:07:02.605
"to bring it through.

03:07:02.605 --> 03:07:04.694
"It is not used to open a portal or a doorway

03:07:04.694 --> 03:07:05.527
"of some kind."

03:07:05.527 --> 03:07:07.422
LIAM: You're saying there's a physical structure or--

03:07:07.422 --> 03:07:08.824
MATT: "Meaning if they are going to use these

03:07:08.824 --> 03:07:10.094
"to bring this city back,

03:07:10.094 --> 03:07:13.244
"they have to bring these stones to the city first."

03:07:13.244 --> 03:07:14.077
LAURA: Okay.

03:07:15.077 --> 03:07:16.747
MATT: "And that means if they are trying to bring

03:07:16.747 --> 03:07:18.357
"these stones to the city,

03:07:18.357 --> 03:07:21.117
"they're looking for something within these ruins

"that'll bring them to it.

03:07:22.917 --> 03:07:27.917
"It could be where this other district is no longer

03:07:28.137 --> 03:07:29.877
"or it could be something else in the ruins

03:07:29.877 --> 03:07:32.097
"that is just a powerful means of traversing

"to the astral plane like you say.

"If we do not have this information,

"we're shooting in the dark."

03:07:37.917 --> 03:07:40.377
SAM: Do you have anyone

03:07:40.377 --> 03:07:42.687
on your side that has done extensive

03:07:42.687 --> 03:07:44.457
explorations of the ruins?

03:07:44.457 --> 03:07:46.917
MATT: "Extensive means but a portion.

03:07:46.917 --> 03:07:48.337
"I'm telling you there are miles

03:07:48.337 --> 03:07:50.760
"and miles and miles of ruins below us

"and only but a small percentage

"has been even remotely charted."

03:07:55.597 --> 03:07:56.747
TRAVIS: I got what you said the first time,

03:07:56.747 --> 03:07:58.147
I just want to make sure that Veth has it.

03:07:58.147 --> 03:08:01.507
You're saying that it sounds as if they are trying

03:08:01.507 --> 03:08:03.547
to take themselves to the city rather than

03:08:03.547 --> 03:08:05.267
bringing the city here?

03:08:05.267 --> 03:08:07.073
LIAM: Correct, they want to carry--

03:08:07.073 --> 03:08:08.807
MATT: "To take the stones to it,

03:08:08.807 --> 03:08:10.557
"to then use the stones to bring it back.

03:08:10.557 --> 03:08:12.037
"If that is their ultimate purpose.

03:08:12.037 --> 03:08:14.127
"The stones cannot open a doorway.

03:08:14.127 --> 03:08:17.787
"They can just anchor something and pull it through.

03:08:17.787 --> 03:08:20.257
"Such cities like Syngorn in Tal'Dorei

03:08:20.257 --> 03:08:22.347
"use this to traverse the planes.

03:08:22.347 --> 03:08:26.287
"In a similar way, this would have to take the stones

03:08:26.287 --> 03:08:28.970
"to the city to bring it back."

03:08:29.957 --> 03:08:31.790
MARISHA: And you don't know--

03:08:31.790 --> 03:08:33.647
TRAVIS: How the fuck do you get to the Astral Sea?

03:08:33.647 --> 03:08:36.377
MARISHA: Well, we did.
TALIESIN: We've done it.

03:08:36.377 --> 03:08:38.287
TRAVIS: On purpose?

03:08:38.287 --> 03:08:39.187
TALIESIN: Kind of.
SAM: No.

03:08:39.187 --> 03:08:41.217
TALIESIN: We've sent things there on purpose.
SAM: We walked through a mouth and got there.

03:08:41.217 --> 03:08:42.781
TRAVIS: Yeah, accidentally.

03:08:42.781 --> 03:08:47.457
TALIESIN: We banished a creature to the Astral Sea.

03:08:47.457 --> 03:08:48.907
MARISHA: But Lucien's--
TRAVIS: Randomly.

03:08:48.907 --> 03:08:52.717
LAURA: I have the ability to shift to another plane.

03:08:52.717 --> 03:08:54.039
MATT: "And I'm certain there are a number

03:08:54.039 --> 03:08:56.537
"of locations within these ruins

03:08:56.537 --> 03:08:58.807
"that at least at one point did the same purpose.

03:08:58.807 --> 03:09:02.037
"It's just finding one or numerous

03:09:02.037 --> 03:09:04.144
"of these specific locations within the ruins

03:09:04.144 --> 03:09:05.947
"that are still capable of doing this."

03:09:05.947 --> 03:09:07.647
LIAM: Which means we can either dig around here

03:09:07.647 --> 03:09:08.580
'til we find one,

03:09:08.580 --> 03:09:13.580
or you can bring us to a random location

03:09:13.837 --> 03:09:15.542
in a very random--
LAURA: In the Astral Sea?

03:09:15.542 --> 03:09:16.958
LIAM: Yes.

03:09:16.958 --> 03:09:19.657
LAURA: That seems very bad.

03:09:19.657 --> 03:09:20.490
MATT: "I--

03:09:23.417 --> 03:09:26.607
"I feel like we need more information or we need more help,

03:09:27.837 --> 03:09:30.102
"more knowledgeable individuals."

03:09:30.102 --> 03:09:31.858
LAURA: Who would know something about it?

03:09:31.858 --> 03:09:33.067
SAM: You know who would know something about it?

03:09:33.067 --> 03:09:35.157
MATT: "I cannot go back to the Dynasty.

03:09:35.157 --> 03:09:38.049
"And I, respectfully, for the time being,

03:09:38.049 --> 03:09:39.757
"can say that there are--

03:09:44.327 --> 03:09:48.890
"I'm worried that my influence is limited."

03:09:49.787 --> 03:09:50.620
TRAVIS: Sure.

03:09:53.807 --> 03:09:57.560
SAM: You're getting boxed out by the Bright Queen?

03:09:59.177 --> 03:10:00.010
MATT: "Well,

03:10:02.317 --> 03:10:03.417
"there are rumors

"within the Dynasty that someone

"has been working with the Empire from within.

"and some previous studies and connections

"has me on the list of possible inquiries.

"And of all those on that list,

"the only one I know to truly be

"the one they're seeking for is myself, so."

03:10:40.007 --> 03:10:41.507
TRAVIS: Well, if we do this right,

03:10:41.507 --> 03:10:43.490
you might get in better standing.

03:10:44.775 --> 03:10:46.167
SAM: You could be a hero.

03:10:47.757 --> 03:10:49.657
TRAVIS: That's little consolation, I'm sorry.

03:10:49.657 --> 03:10:51.887
You've a shit situation.

03:10:51.887 --> 03:10:52.997
MATT: "I put myself here.

03:10:52.997 --> 03:10:55.727
"There is no one to blame but myself,

"but I appreciate that."

03:10:58.577 --> 03:11:00.272
TRAVIS: What were you going to say?

03:11:00.272 --> 03:11:01.864
LAURA: Oh, I was going to say we could ask Vess,

03:11:01.864 --> 03:11:03.517
but she got taken.

03:11:03.517 --> 03:11:08.033
SAM: Yes, but there might be someone else

03:11:09.916 --> 03:11:11.059
on the--

03:11:11.059 --> 03:11:12.109
TALIESIN: Tal'Dorei Council.

03:11:14.537 --> 03:11:18.377
SAM: -- on the Empire side that we're not thinking of.

03:11:18.377 --> 03:11:20.927
I don't think Vess confided in anyone, but--

03:11:20.927 --> 03:11:22.587
MARISHA: Where did we put Halas' body?

03:11:22.587 --> 03:11:24.917
Is he also in the Bag of Holding?

03:11:24.917 --> 03:11:28.747
LAURA: No.
LIAM: Halas is in the Folding Halls,

03:11:28.747 --> 03:11:30.137
MATT: Correct.
LIAM: In the prison.

03:11:30.137 --> 03:11:31.577
MATT: I accidentally forgot that part

03:11:31.577 --> 03:11:34.047
and we briefly roleplayed incinerating the body,

03:11:34.047 --> 03:11:38.557
but going back into the actual lore elements,

03:11:38.557 --> 03:11:39.777
the body was left in the halls.

03:11:39.777 --> 03:11:41.217
LIAM: We dumped him in the prison there.

03:11:41.217 --> 03:11:42.050
LAURA: Yeah.

03:11:42.929 --> 03:11:44.257
MARISHA: And we left him there, right?

03:11:44.257 --> 03:11:48.154
LIAM: Where Nott died.

03:11:48.154 --> 03:11:48.987
Briefly.

03:11:48.987 --> 03:11:51.097
TALIESIN: We have the Cobalt Soul, we have Allura.

03:11:51.097 --> 03:11:53.263
SAM: If these Luxon Beacons

03:11:53.263 --> 03:11:57.367
are somehow related to the city,

03:11:57.367 --> 03:12:00.917
to the Somnovum, then it stands to reason

03:12:00.917 --> 03:12:05.337
that the folks in the Empire who have done the most study

03:12:05.337 --> 03:12:09.147
of the Luxon Beacons might know something

03:12:09.147 --> 03:12:13.737
about this place and where to find them here.

03:12:13.737 --> 03:12:14.699
I'm talking about like--

03:12:14.699 --> 03:12:15.887
LAURA and MARISHA: Trent?!
SAM: Trent.

03:12:15.887 --> 03:12:16.720
Yeah.

03:12:16.720 --> 03:12:19.187
MARISHA: You want us to go to the worst people?

03:12:19.187 --> 03:12:22.667
SAM: No, I want us to go to the people who know him closest.

03:12:22.667 --> 03:12:25.897
TRAVIS: Yep.
SAM: Eadwulf and Astrid.

03:12:25.897 --> 03:12:27.597
MATT: There is a very visceral reaction

03:12:27.597 --> 03:12:31.547
when you mentioned Trent in Essek's face.

03:12:31.547 --> 03:12:33.037
Kind of a--

03:12:33.037 --> 03:12:34.207
TALIESIN: We know.

03:12:34.207 --> 03:12:36.306
LAURA: Yeah, he's the worst, isn't he?

03:12:36.306 --> 03:12:37.830
SAM: I mean, unless you were--

03:12:37.830 --> 03:12:39.621
are you friends with him or something?

03:12:39.621 --> 03:12:40.454
LIAM: What are your dealings with him?

03:12:40.454 --> 03:12:42.507
MATT: "We have had dealings, yes."

03:12:42.507 --> 03:12:45.265
SAM: Like back channels?
MARISHA: Ey, it was Trent?!

03:12:45.265 --> 03:12:46.220
SAM: Back channels?

03:12:46.220 --> 03:12:48.367
MARISHA: It was Trent!

03:12:48.367 --> 03:12:51.097
SAM: I mean, I figured it out, but for Fjord's benefit,

03:12:51.097 --> 03:12:53.497
can you just explain your relationship to Trent?

03:12:55.167 --> 03:12:59.337
MATT: "Briefly, Ludinus was my main contact

03:12:59.337 --> 03:13:00.957
"in the delivery of the beacon

03:13:00.957 --> 03:13:03.630
"and the sharing of information.

03:13:04.737 --> 03:13:08.477
"But at times in which Ludinus was not available,

03:13:08.477 --> 03:13:13.420
"Trent was sent as his envoy."
MARISHA: Motherfucker.

03:13:16.357 --> 03:13:18.127
MATT: "If you think I'm not worth trusting,

03:13:18.127 --> 03:13:21.947
"do <i>not</i> trust any one of the Assembly,

03:13:21.947 --> 03:13:25.107
"but definitely not Ikithon."

03:13:25.107 --> 03:13:26.957
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, we're with you on that one.

03:13:28.757 --> 03:13:30.697
SAM: Ludinus is still alive, correct?

03:13:30.697 --> 03:13:32.196
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: Trent is still alive.

03:13:32.196 --> 03:13:33.029
LAURA: Yeah.

03:13:34.005 --> 03:13:35.480
MATT: "Is anyone not alive?"

03:13:36.872 --> 03:13:38.887
SAM: I mean...

03:13:38.887 --> 03:13:40.147
LAURA: Oh, should I have not told him?

03:13:40.147 --> 03:13:41.780
TALIESIN: No, we need to, that's important--

03:13:41.780 --> 03:13:44.254
SAM: I think it's okay because Ludinus and Vess

03:13:44.254 --> 03:13:46.639
hated each other.
MATT: "What's happened to Vess DeRogna?"

03:13:46.639 --> 03:13:48.997
TRAVIS: Vess DeRogna was killed by Lucien,

03:13:48.997 --> 03:13:50.313
by himself--

03:13:50.313 --> 03:13:52.617
MARISHA: Sort of on our watch.
TRAVIS: -- with barely lifting a finger.

03:13:52.617 --> 03:13:54.227
TALIESIN: While we slept.
LAURA: Yeah.

03:13:54.227 --> 03:13:57.733
MARISHA: It happened real fast.
LAURA: He snuck into her room while we were--

03:13:57.733 --> 03:13:58.566
LIAM: Havin' bacon.

03:13:58.566 --> 03:14:00.740
MATT: You see him getting real nervous now.

03:14:00.740 --> 03:14:01.598
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah, shit's bad.

03:14:01.598 --> 03:14:02.431
MATT: "So--"

03:14:02.431 --> 03:14:04.097
TALIESIN: We had her body until he stole it.

03:14:04.097 --> 03:14:06.674
SAM: We're here now, so you can't get out of this.

03:14:06.674 --> 03:14:08.059
MATT: "I apologize."
SAM: They're coming for you now.

03:14:08.059 --> 03:14:10.000
TRAVIS: We're, like, six shots of tequila in.
MATT: "My nerves--

03:14:10.000 --> 03:14:12.400
"So is that cocoa done?"

03:14:13.694 --> 03:14:15.597
SAM: It feels like a long time for the cocoa.

03:14:15.597 --> 03:14:17.742
MATT: "Could I please-- do you have any cocoa?"

03:14:17.742 --> 03:14:19.157
TRAVIS: (laughs)

03:14:19.157 --> 03:14:20.265
TALIESIN: Do I? God, it's been a while.

03:14:20.265 --> 03:14:21.707
MARISHA: You want some whiskey in that cocoa?

03:14:21.707 --> 03:14:22.797
MATT: "Certainly."

03:14:22.797 --> 03:14:23.839
MARISHA: Okay, I take out--

03:14:23.839 --> 03:14:25.827
TALIESIN: Actually, has the cocoa been delivered yet?

03:14:25.827 --> 03:14:26.897
MATT: You can go and check outside.

03:14:26.897 --> 03:14:28.017
TALIESIN: I'll go find, yeah.

03:14:28.017 --> 03:14:29.327
TRAVIS: Somebody's knocking on the silent door.

03:14:29.327 --> 03:14:30.867
MATT: Right, we'll say, for the sake, at that point

03:14:30.867 --> 03:14:32.572
someone's like, "Cocoa?"

03:14:32.572 --> 03:14:33.538
"Thanks."

03:14:33.538 --> 03:14:35.389
TRAVIS: I've been out here for 20 minutes!

03:14:35.389 --> 03:14:36.880
MATT: Essek goes, "So--

03:14:39.827 --> 03:14:41.187
"so you were traveling with a member

03:14:41.187 --> 03:14:44.667
"of the Assembly, who was then killed in your presence,

03:14:44.667 --> 03:14:47.687
"whose body you lost, who was last known to be

03:14:47.687 --> 03:14:49.954
"in your proximity?"
LIAM: We had it for awhile.

03:14:49.954 --> 03:14:53.257
MATT: "And you've then come to me."

03:14:53.257 --> 03:14:54.090
TALIESIN: We're aware.

03:14:55.177 --> 03:14:56.010
MATT: (sighs)

03:14:56.010 --> 03:14:59.818
LAURA: But we left a real good note that said she was--

03:15:02.667 --> 03:15:04.587
MATT: He starts looking around the room real nervously,

03:15:04.587 --> 03:15:05.665
like glancing about, you see him put

03:15:05.665 --> 03:15:07.447
his hand across the way, his eyes flash for a second,

03:15:07.447 --> 03:15:08.538
he's just glancing around.

03:15:08.538 --> 03:15:09.655
LAURA: Do you see any little orbs?

03:15:09.655 --> 03:15:11.407
Because Lucien spies on us a lot.

03:15:11.407 --> 03:15:13.257
TRAVIS: I've done that already, we're okay.

03:15:15.082 --> 03:15:15.915
We've been doing it--

03:15:15.915 --> 03:15:17.292
TALIESIN: She was part of the cult.

03:15:17.292 --> 03:15:19.297
MATT: He just chugs the whiskey chocolate.

03:15:19.297 --> 03:15:21.997
TALIESIN: She was also part of the Nonagon cult.

03:15:21.997 --> 03:15:24.147
TRAVIS: And she is with Lucien now.

03:15:24.147 --> 03:15:26.587
LIAM: I mean, Essek, you already said that you are nervous

03:15:26.587 --> 03:15:28.307
that threads are going to lead back to you.

03:15:28.307 --> 03:15:30.500
In for a penny, in for a pound.

03:15:32.771 --> 03:15:36.020
LAURA: (gasps) Essek, do you have--

03:15:36.877 --> 03:15:38.677
do you have any knowledge with the beacons?

03:15:38.677 --> 03:15:40.907
Is there any way to pull a soul

03:15:40.907 --> 03:15:43.710
out of the body that's been sent into it?

03:15:46.014 --> 03:15:47.923
MATT: "In what way?"

03:15:47.923 --> 03:15:50.987
LAURA: You know how the beacon keeps the souls

03:15:50.987 --> 03:15:52.275
and then when the people that are born

03:15:52.275 --> 03:15:53.973
it gets sent into someone else, right?

03:15:53.973 --> 03:15:55.057
MATT: "Yes."

03:15:55.057 --> 03:15:57.626
LAURA: Is there a way to pull that soul back out?

03:16:00.227 --> 03:16:01.785
MATT: "I mean, only through--

03:16:01.785 --> 03:16:06.502
"such magic is very powerful resurrection types.

03:16:09.562 --> 03:16:11.685
"Far from my understanding.

03:16:13.347 --> 03:16:14.727
"Why?"

03:16:14.727 --> 03:16:19.407
LAURA: Well, Lucien said that he became the Nonagon.

03:16:21.252 --> 03:16:23.377
He read a book

03:16:24.337 --> 03:16:28.834
and it opened up this pathway in his mind.

03:16:28.834 --> 03:16:32.427
And the Nonagon overtook him, right?

03:16:32.427 --> 03:16:37.427
He was killed and born again as our friend, Molly,

03:16:37.987 --> 03:16:39.932
who was with us for a while.

03:16:41.047 --> 03:16:45.967
Molly died and then Lucien's fellow Tomb Takers found him

03:16:45.967 --> 03:16:46.957
and brought him back to life.

03:16:46.957 --> 03:16:49.247
I know, it's very complicated.

03:16:49.247 --> 03:16:53.402
But they brought the soul back into the body.

03:16:55.537 --> 03:16:58.457
If we can get it back out, then he'll lose his power.

03:16:58.457 --> 03:17:02.173
Then they'll have to find someone else to be the Nonagon.

03:17:04.237 --> 03:17:05.070
I don't know.

03:17:06.307 --> 03:17:08.177
MATT: "So you're asking if it's possible to pull the soul

03:17:08.177 --> 03:17:09.797
"out of Lucien?"

03:17:09.797 --> 03:17:10.630
LAURA: Yes.

03:17:11.977 --> 03:17:14.727
MATT: "Not any way that I know,
beyond the old fashioned way."

03:17:18.077 --> 03:17:23.077
TRAVIS: Or pulling the soul out of

03:17:23.827 --> 03:17:25.687
just the form, if it's still somewhat

03:17:25.687 --> 03:17:27.577
dormant inside of Lucien,

03:17:27.577 --> 03:17:29.490
not him, but someone else.

03:17:31.627 --> 03:17:33.293
MATT: "It's possible."
LAURA: What if when we kill Lucien

03:17:33.293 --> 03:17:34.697
we have to have a beacon right by it

03:17:34.697 --> 03:17:36.627
so the soul gets sucked into the beacon

03:17:36.627 --> 03:17:38.244
and then he'll be trapped in there.

03:17:38.244 --> 03:17:39.669
MATT: "Well, the beacon only pulls souls

03:17:39.669 --> 03:17:41.101
"that have been consecuted."

03:17:41.101 --> 03:17:41.934
LAURA: Oh.

03:17:43.897 --> 03:17:44.757
MARISHA: We don't know.

03:17:44.757 --> 03:17:45.590
TRAVIS: Could have been.

03:17:45.590 --> 03:17:47.170
MARISHA: He could have been, we don't know.

03:17:47.170 --> 03:17:49.035
LIAM: I wonder, we've been--

03:17:49.035 --> 03:17:50.447
TRAVIS: That bitch has been around a long time.

03:17:50.447 --> 03:17:53.093
LIAM: We've been talking a long time about these,

03:17:54.457 --> 03:17:56.837
all of these people in the city, these voices,

03:17:56.837 --> 03:17:59.884
millions of voices and--

03:18:01.460 --> 03:18:03.360
MARISHA: Yeah.
LIAM: And as we traverse these ruins,

03:18:03.360 --> 03:18:08.167
we've also seen many people frozen in some sort of

03:18:09.337 --> 03:18:13.232
stasis like Vess in my little ball of amber.

03:18:14.517 --> 03:18:17.557
And that there are many similarities between

03:18:17.557 --> 03:18:20.777
the architecture and the structures that we have seen

03:18:20.777 --> 03:18:24.207
in the geometric, the mathematical

03:18:26.437 --> 03:18:28.477
qualities of your artifacts.

03:18:28.477 --> 03:18:30.927
I wonder if, if these beacons

03:18:30.927 --> 03:18:34.697
are some sort of device that either

03:18:37.547 --> 03:18:39.630
saved the people of Aeor in that terrible moment

03:18:39.630 --> 03:18:43.488
saved the people of Aeor in that terrible moment

03:18:45.177 --> 03:18:49.807
and they are now living in consecuted people today?

03:18:49.807 --> 03:18:54.580
Or these millions of voices crying out in the Astral Sea?

03:18:57.299 --> 03:19:00.882
MARISHA: Uh-huh.
TALIESIN: Have homes that they're coming to.

03:19:00.882 --> 03:19:04.112
They're going to bring the city back

03:19:05.277 --> 03:19:06.497
alive and mad.

03:19:06.497 --> 03:19:10.487
LIAM: If these beacons are of an earlier time

03:19:11.477 --> 03:19:15.317
and they are very advanced, obviously far more advanced

03:19:15.317 --> 03:19:17.460
than we are, from all that time ago,

03:19:19.477 --> 03:19:22.570
maybe there was some sort of fail-safe for their people.

03:19:25.357 --> 03:19:26.657
And then they were dug up.

03:19:29.427 --> 03:19:30.910
And the Dynasty rose.

03:19:33.294 --> 03:19:36.057
MATT: "It is an interesting idea, though I would

03:19:36.057 --> 03:19:38.897
"caution to keep it close to the chest.

03:19:38.897 --> 03:19:41.587
"Such conversations might be considered sacrilege

03:19:41.587 --> 03:19:43.927
"in some circles of the Dynasty.

03:19:43.927 --> 03:19:44.760
"So just."

03:19:46.687 --> 03:19:48.129
LIAM: What do you think?

03:19:52.817 --> 03:19:54.177
MATT: "I mean, there are a great many mysteries

03:19:54.177 --> 03:19:57.260
"still with these beacons in the beginning.

03:19:58.787 --> 03:20:00.170
"There is too much,

03:20:01.597 --> 03:20:03.857
"too much showing the Luxon's presence

03:20:03.857 --> 03:20:06.347
"for me to deny any sort of connotation or connection

03:20:06.347 --> 03:20:08.767
"though I do not necessarily buy into

03:20:08.767 --> 03:20:10.207
"the ideas of its divinity

03:20:11.287 --> 03:20:13.920
"or at least the religious constructs around it.

03:20:16.149 --> 03:20:16.982
"I would--

03:20:22.860 --> 03:20:23.990
"But I do know

03:20:26.114 --> 03:20:30.167
"that there are many powerful sites within these ruins.

03:20:32.069 --> 03:20:33.402
"And I'd be curious to see

03:20:34.797 --> 03:20:36.907
"what a beacon could accomplish in these spaces,"

03:20:36.907 --> 03:20:37.996
and he, for the first time really

03:20:37.996 --> 03:20:40.319
starts making the eye contact with you and says,

03:20:42.077 --> 03:20:43.777
"If such an object were to be found

03:20:45.457 --> 03:20:48.657
"and channeled and unlocked in ways

03:20:48.657 --> 03:20:52.487
"that we have not even possibly considered

03:20:55.297 --> 03:20:57.947
"think of the possibilities of how we could manipulate

03:21:00.727 --> 03:21:02.437
"the fabric of time.

03:21:05.101 --> 03:21:06.701
"Not just forwards."

03:21:09.283 --> 03:21:10.207
LIAM: What was that last bit?

03:21:10.207 --> 03:21:11.718
MATT: "Not just forwards.

03:21:16.757 --> 03:21:17.777
"The ability to

03:21:20.937 --> 03:21:22.460
"perhaps undo mistakes.

03:21:31.357 --> 03:21:32.427
"But regardless,

03:21:37.467 --> 03:21:40.117
"you likely have the eyes of the Assembly upon you

03:21:40.117 --> 03:21:42.797
"and whether or not you meant to,

03:21:42.797 --> 03:21:45.200
"have brought them uncomfortably close to myself.

03:21:55.177 --> 03:21:56.447
"Is it possible to put some distance

03:21:56.447 --> 03:21:57.800
"between us for just a time?"

03:22:00.257 --> 03:22:01.110
MARISHA: How much time?

03:22:02.017 --> 03:22:03.637
MATT: "As much time as you need to prepare for whatever

03:22:03.637 --> 03:22:07.367
"it is you're doing, and for myself to prepare for

03:22:07.367 --> 03:22:09.847
"what I could possibly help with."

03:22:09.847 --> 03:22:12.277
SAM: You want us to go somewhere or?

03:22:12.277 --> 03:22:13.510
MATT: "Or I could leave."

03:22:15.167 --> 03:22:16.915
TRAVIS: Are you talking about this outpost

03:22:16.915 --> 03:22:18.947
or just a different section of it?

03:22:18.947 --> 03:22:19.780
MATT: "I don't know."

03:22:21.137 --> 03:22:23.457
SAM: You can have your space, if that's what you need.

03:22:23.457 --> 03:22:24.290
TALIESIN: I understand.

03:22:25.419 --> 03:22:27.637
We're going to have to make some very uncomfortable--

03:22:27.637 --> 03:22:30.067
MATT: "I just-- if we are going to go into these ruins,

03:22:30.067 --> 03:22:33.987
"I feel like we should not be close together

03:22:33.987 --> 03:22:36.117
"until we're ready to delve.

03:22:36.117 --> 03:22:40.110
"Because any time we spend between in proximity

03:22:41.847 --> 03:22:45.517
"means that either one of us
is drawing danger to the other."

03:22:47.676 --> 03:22:49.592
TALIESIN: How dangerous would it be to
make our home out here?

03:22:49.592 --> 03:22:54.017
TALIESIN: How dangerous would it be to
make our home out here?

03:22:57.705 --> 03:23:00.377
LIAM: Well, I can't make that home.

03:23:00.377 --> 03:23:02.047
TALIESIN: Okay.
LIAM: Today.

03:23:02.047 --> 03:23:05.427
But maybe we access some provisions,

03:23:05.427 --> 03:23:07.194
restock our supplies, and--

03:23:08.267 --> 03:23:10.967
MARISHA: Maybe at least sleep a night?
LIAM: Part our ways?

03:23:10.967 --> 03:23:12.467
Is that what you would prefer?

03:23:15.927 --> 03:23:17.217
MATT: "I should not leave this outpost

03:23:17.217 --> 03:23:20.780
"I have responsibilities here and people that rely on me."

03:23:24.927 --> 03:23:26.287
MARISHA: Can we stay for the night?

03:23:26.287 --> 03:23:28.437
MATT: "Oh yes, of course, of course,
you can stay for the night.

03:23:28.437 --> 03:23:30.968
"I apologize, I'm just--"

03:23:34.347 --> 03:23:35.666
And he looks genuinely mournful.

03:23:35.666 --> 03:23:36.732
He's like, "I apologize,

03:23:36.732 --> 03:23:38.490
"I am genuinely happy to see you."

03:23:40.977 --> 03:23:42.360
TALIESIN: I wouldn't be.

03:23:44.097 --> 03:23:44.930
MATT: "I just,

03:23:46.937 --> 03:23:48.760
"I worry we bring a lot of,

03:23:50.820 --> 03:23:52.678
"a lot of danger upon each other.

03:23:55.067 --> 03:23:58.068
"So I have no reservations with helping you.

03:23:58.068 --> 03:24:01.560
"And I'm happy to go into these ruins at your side.

03:24:05.326 --> 03:24:10.174
"But until we cross that threshold, we are both targets."

03:24:10.174 --> 03:24:11.297
TRAVIS: Oh, that's fine, we'd been living

03:24:11.297 --> 03:24:13.007
in a constant state of fear and death

03:24:13.007 --> 03:24:15.187
for, I don't know, as long as I can remember.

03:24:15.187 --> 03:24:18.657
Before you leave, though, on your side in the Dynasty,

03:24:18.657 --> 03:24:19.807
if it's not the Bright Queen,

03:24:19.807 --> 03:24:23.997
I would ask one or two contacts that perhaps you do trust

03:24:23.997 --> 03:24:26.657
or do have some credit with?

03:24:26.657 --> 03:24:28.187
It would be nice to be able to answer

03:24:28.187 --> 03:24:29.807
some of these questions.

03:24:29.807 --> 03:24:31.240
I think we'll be making a list of people

03:24:31.240 --> 03:24:35.450
that we'll be checking in with before we delve, as you say.

03:24:37.897 --> 03:24:40.443
MATT: "I fear my brother is stationed in Bazzoxan.

03:24:40.443 --> 03:24:42.572
"It's too far from Rosohna."

03:24:45.558 --> 03:24:47.104
SAM: Brother?

03:24:47.104 --> 03:24:48.757
Did we know you had a brother?

03:24:48.757 --> 03:24:49.590
LIAM: Yes, we did.

03:24:49.590 --> 03:24:50.423
SAM: We did?

03:24:51.747 --> 03:24:53.127
TRAVIS: Do now.

03:24:53.127 --> 03:24:56.208
MATT: "But I don't know of much help he would be in.

03:24:56.208 --> 03:24:59.687
"He's too far from such places."

03:24:59.687 --> 03:25:02.267
TRAVIS: And if they're not immediately available,

03:25:02.267 --> 03:25:06.887
at least someone that we can use as a resource for--

03:25:06.887 --> 03:25:10.260
MATT: "Starguide Uraya, Uraya Hythenos, perhaps.

03:25:11.637 --> 03:25:13.727
"A goblin friend of mine, I believe they spoke to you

03:25:13.727 --> 03:25:16.947
"when I was unable to reach out that day."

03:25:16.947 --> 03:25:17.780
LAURA: Oh, yes.

03:25:18.617 --> 03:25:22.627
MATT: "They have returned to Rosohna to deliver reports.

03:25:22.627 --> 03:25:24.577
"Asking around, they would be somebody I trust,

03:25:24.577 --> 03:25:25.728
"one of the few."

03:25:25.728 --> 03:25:26.561
LAURA: Okay.

03:25:29.787 --> 03:25:31.897
MATT: "This is good cocoa, thank you."

03:25:35.017 --> 03:25:35.850
TRAVIS: It's poisoned.

03:25:38.757 --> 03:25:42.020
LAURA: I sprinkled the dust of deliciousness into that.

03:25:43.567 --> 03:25:45.810
SAM: And I put sovereign glue in it.

03:25:47.070 --> 03:25:48.470
TRAVIS: And absinthe.

03:25:48.470 --> 03:25:49.697
And yogurt.

03:25:49.697 --> 03:25:51.546
SAM: (gagging)

03:25:53.057 --> 03:25:58.057
TRAVIS: It's a lot, I know, especially all in one sitting,

03:25:58.327 --> 03:26:00.117
but look at it this way,

03:26:00.117 --> 03:26:02.260
it'll take your mind off things for a bit.

03:26:03.202 --> 03:26:07.412
One terrible danger totally replaced by another eminent one.

03:26:09.293 --> 03:26:10.126
MATT: "You're,

03:26:12.266 --> 03:26:15.544
"you certainly carve a unique destiny, don't you?

03:26:21.977 --> 03:26:22.940
"I apologize.

03:26:26.187 --> 03:26:28.917
"My mind is a complicated swim these days.

03:26:30.347 --> 03:26:31.500
"I'm sorry for a lot.

03:26:32.617 --> 03:26:33.450
"A lot.

03:26:36.007 --> 03:26:37.602
"And do as you will.

03:26:37.602 --> 03:26:40.252
"I cannot tell you what to do."

03:26:42.103 --> 03:26:45.167
LAURA: We'll give some distance.

03:26:45.167 --> 03:26:47.767
MATT: "But when you're ready, come find me, I'll be here.

03:26:50.127 --> 03:26:50.960
"Maybe,

03:26:52.947 --> 03:26:54.447
"gather what resources you can,

03:26:55.557 --> 03:26:57.290
"other friends, perhaps.

03:26:59.887 --> 03:27:03.347
"If we're going to trek into the heart

03:27:03.347 --> 03:27:06.317
"of these ruins in hopes of waylaying

03:27:06.317 --> 03:27:08.197
"or stopping this Nonagon

03:27:09.997 --> 03:27:13.147
"and bringing this nightmare over

03:27:14.987 --> 03:27:16.670
"we're going to need all the help we can get."

03:27:23.767 --> 03:27:25.067
SAM: Thank you, Essek.

03:27:29.677 --> 03:27:30.510
MATT: "Thank you."

03:27:32.461 --> 03:27:35.810
SAM: Let's head out and figure our next move.

03:27:39.827 --> 03:27:40.727
MARISHA: Okay.

03:27:40.727 --> 03:27:42.837
MATT: "Well, that has been a pleasurable experience.

03:27:42.837 --> 03:27:44.247
"Thank you so much for coming by."

03:27:44.247 --> 03:27:46.795
The door opens up and the guard on the other side turns.

03:27:47.828 --> 03:27:50.117
"But yes, please take of our provisions,

03:27:50.117 --> 03:27:53.837
"rest for the night, and continue your journey as necessary.

03:27:53.837 --> 03:27:56.687
"Should you need anything else, you know where to find me."

03:27:58.337 --> 03:27:59.315
LAURA: Bye.
MARISHA: Thank you.

03:27:59.315 --> 03:28:00.173
TALIESIN: Thank you, thank you.

03:28:02.177 --> 03:28:03.487
MATT: The door closes behind you--

03:28:03.487 --> 03:28:04.937
LIAM: Nope, I catch him by the forearm,

03:28:04.937 --> 03:28:07.637
last one out, and say: Just breathe.

03:28:09.505 --> 03:28:11.105
MATT: (exhales)
LIAM: Just...

03:28:12.585 --> 03:28:15.668
breathe that fresh air,

03:28:15.668 --> 03:28:17.285
mindful of the people about.

03:28:20.347 --> 03:28:21.180
Time.

03:28:24.617 --> 03:28:25.450
Time.

03:28:28.337 --> 03:28:29.845
Not weeks, not years.

03:28:32.747 --> 03:28:33.740
It takes time.

03:28:38.847 --> 03:28:39.680
MATT: "Indeed."

03:28:47.527 --> 03:28:49.992
You all are escorted and given a space

03:28:49.992 --> 03:28:51.937
that is comfortable.

03:28:51.937 --> 03:28:53.897
It looks like since you've arrived, there has been

03:28:53.897 --> 03:28:55.387
expectation of you staying for a bit

03:28:55.387 --> 03:28:56.837
and they've cleared out what may have been

03:28:56.837 --> 03:28:59.850
just a general storage chamber or a simple barracks,

03:29:00.817 --> 03:29:04.197
but it is outfitted as comfortably as such a place can be.

03:29:04.197 --> 03:29:07.757
There are some heavier furs, blankets, some pillows

03:29:07.757 --> 03:29:09.327
that have been thrown together it's not--

03:29:09.327 --> 03:29:10.207
TRAVIS: That's not bad.

03:29:10.207 --> 03:29:12.817
MATT: Yeah, it is by no means terrible.

03:29:12.817 --> 03:29:14.247
It's no tower.

03:29:14.247 --> 03:29:18.057
It's no tower, but it is certainly better

03:29:18.057 --> 03:29:21.999
than the middle of the snow and under a rocky overhang.

03:29:21.999 --> 03:29:23.757
TRAVIS: For a GI, that's not bad.

03:29:25.926 --> 03:29:28.742
MATT: You guys are left to your devices in the chamber.

03:29:28.742 --> 03:29:30.125
MARISHA: Are we more or less alone?

03:29:30.125 --> 03:29:31.737
MATT: More or less.
MARISHA: Other people?

03:29:31.737 --> 03:29:34.067
TRAVIS: I think my vision has dropped, yes?

03:29:34.067 --> 03:29:35.507
MATT: At this point, I'd say yeah.

03:29:35.507 --> 03:29:38.157
LIAM: How big of room were we given?

03:29:38.157 --> 03:29:40.330
MATT: I'd say it's about 15 by 20 feet.

03:29:40.330 --> 03:29:41.438
LIAM: 15 by 20 feet, okay.

03:29:41.438 --> 03:29:42.593
MATT: Not terribly large.

03:29:44.857 --> 03:29:45.857
TRAVIS: Well, that was fun.

03:29:45.857 --> 03:29:47.837
It was like validation, you know,

03:29:47.837 --> 03:29:51.557
seeing someone's expression relay the horribleness

03:29:51.557 --> 03:29:53.435
of the past few days for us.

03:29:53.435 --> 03:29:55.143
MARISHA: Yeah, you're not wrong there.
TALIESIN: I feel seen.

03:29:55.143 --> 03:29:55.976
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Yeah.

03:29:55.976 --> 03:29:58.271
TRAVIS: (laughs) "I feel seen."

03:29:58.271 --> 03:29:59.117
TALIESIN: It's been a week or two.

03:29:59.117 --> 03:30:02.187
SAM: We have some assets now, we have Essek,

03:30:02.187 --> 03:30:06.507
we have Dagen, we have Essek's people if we

03:30:06.507 --> 03:30:07.887
want to call on them.

03:30:07.887 --> 03:30:08.977
MARISHA: I don't know about that.

03:30:08.977 --> 03:30:10.860
TALIESIN: How about the Cobalt Soul?
LAURA: Who else do we know that can help?

03:30:10.860 --> 03:30:12.351
TRAVIS: I was making a list.

03:30:12.351 --> 03:30:15.437
Trent: not, that's not no, but--

03:30:15.437 --> 03:30:16.270
MARISHA: Yussa?

03:30:16.270 --> 03:30:17.487
SAM: Yussa maybe.
TRAVIS: Yep.

03:30:17.487 --> 03:30:19.927
LAURA: I mean, if we appeal to Yussa in a way that says,

03:30:19.927 --> 03:30:21.587
you know, he can find some really

03:30:21.587 --> 03:30:23.277
wonderful old relics, I mean,

03:30:23.277 --> 03:30:25.617
that's what he's obsessed with, right?

03:30:25.617 --> 03:30:26.450
SAM: Sure, but is he--

03:30:26.450 --> 03:30:28.182
LAURA: I bet he would know some shit about this.

03:30:28.182 --> 03:30:30.257
TRAVIS: I mean, what about, what about the--

03:30:30.257 --> 03:30:33.107
the blonde-- Allura?

03:30:33.107 --> 03:30:35.455
I mean, she was there, she's clever.

03:30:35.455 --> 03:30:36.288
LIAM: And would care.

03:30:36.288 --> 03:30:38.647
I feel like Yussa, while very knowledgeable

03:30:38.647 --> 03:30:40.297
and certainly worth talking to, is maybe

03:30:40.297 --> 03:30:43.617
in more of a Netflix and chill mode in Nicodranas.

03:30:43.617 --> 03:30:47.940
You know, he seems contented to just study and stay safe.

03:30:49.075 --> 03:30:52.757
Allura on the other hand strikes me as--

03:30:52.757 --> 03:30:54.567
SAM: She's got her own responsibilities

03:30:54.567 --> 03:30:57.997
on the Tal'Dorei Council with six, seven,

03:30:57.997 --> 03:30:59.825
eight other members of the Council?

03:30:59.825 --> 03:31:01.887
I'm not quite sure the numbers.

03:31:01.887 --> 03:31:02.727
LIAM: Yeah, but her intentions--

03:31:02.727 --> 03:31:04.937
LAURA: Do we still have the mirror?
LIAM: -- are in the right place.

03:31:04.937 --> 03:31:05.937
SAM: Oh.

03:31:05.937 --> 03:31:08.317
LAURA: The mirror that we used to talk to her.

03:31:08.317 --> 03:31:10.000
LIAM: Oh my gosh, I haven't thought of that in ages.

03:31:10.000 --> 03:31:10.836
SAM: It's probably in the bag.

03:31:10.836 --> 03:31:12.484
MARISHA: Probably in the bag yeah.

03:31:12.484 --> 03:31:14.807
LAURA: Well, I have my own, I've got my haversack.

03:31:14.807 --> 03:31:16.987
So if it was something on my person

03:31:16.987 --> 03:31:18.357
then it would not be in the bag.

03:31:18.357 --> 03:31:20.927
MATT: Well, is it written down in your collection of items?

03:31:20.927 --> 03:31:22.617
SAM: She doesn't write anything down.

03:31:22.617 --> 03:31:24.827
She draws a bunch of dick pictures all over.

03:31:24.827 --> 03:31:26.677
MATT: Wow, those are some empty pockets.

03:31:26.677 --> 03:31:28.060
LAURA: (laughs)

03:31:29.305 --> 03:31:30.707
I don't know. Let me look.

03:31:30.707 --> 03:31:31.977
TALIESIN: It's just a bag of fucks.

03:31:31.977 --> 03:31:35.047
MATT: If it's not written down in your items or equipment,

03:31:35.047 --> 03:31:36.627
then it either was in the Bag of Holding

03:31:36.627 --> 03:31:38.787
or it was returned to Allura when you guys had--

03:31:38.787 --> 03:31:40.241
LAURA: It was returned to Allura.
MATT: I'm pretty sure

03:31:40.241 --> 03:31:43.141
it was returned because it was a borrowed item.

03:31:43.141 --> 03:31:44.387
It wasn't a gift.

03:31:44.387 --> 03:31:45.497
TALIESIN: I have some weird-ass stuff.

03:31:45.497 --> 03:31:48.917
LAURA: I got a fuckton of chuckle
dust and oops-stones though.

03:31:48.917 --> 03:31:52.212
MATT: Hell yeah. Look out, Lucien!

03:31:52.212 --> 03:31:53.900
TALIESIN: A bunch of diamonds.

03:31:53.900 --> 03:31:55.625
MATT: (laughs)
SAM: Oops!

03:31:56.837 --> 03:32:00.470
I'm keen on reaching out to Eadwulf and Astrid.

03:32:01.867 --> 03:32:03.985
LIAM: This is very complicated.

03:32:03.985 --> 03:32:04.818
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:32:04.818 --> 03:32:06.347
SAM: They were looking for a reason--

03:32:06.347 --> 03:32:09.727
well, Astrid was looking for a reason to jump ship,

03:32:09.727 --> 03:32:11.357
looking for a way to help.

03:32:11.357 --> 03:32:13.267
This is the way she can help.

03:32:13.267 --> 03:32:15.480
She must have knowledge, being close to him.

03:32:16.797 --> 03:32:17.890
LIAM: Well, it is worth--

03:32:21.487 --> 03:32:23.680
SAM: She almost left with you that night.

03:32:24.957 --> 03:32:27.167
MARISHA: She just feels below the pay grade

03:32:27.167 --> 03:32:29.644
that I'm interested in, personally.

03:32:29.644 --> 03:32:32.247
SAM: She has access to stuff.

03:32:32.247 --> 03:32:35.267
Maps, research, books.

03:32:35.267 --> 03:32:37.085
MARISHA: Yeah, so do I.

03:32:37.085 --> 03:32:38.417
SAM: But not now.

03:32:38.417 --> 03:32:39.817
You're not near a library.

03:32:39.817 --> 03:32:41.437
She's in the belly of the beast.

03:32:41.437 --> 03:32:42.867
She can walk up to the office

03:32:42.867 --> 03:32:44.927
and grab anything we need her to.

03:32:44.927 --> 03:32:46.727
LIAM: And the Assembly--
LAURA: And do what with it?

03:32:46.727 --> 03:32:47.590
MARISHA: Exactly.

03:32:47.590 --> 03:32:51.497
LIAM: -- has their own studies and information

03:32:51.497 --> 03:32:53.862
that are not privy to the Cobalt Soul.

03:32:53.862 --> 03:32:56.027
MARISHA: Yeah, but it doesn't mean they're our allies

03:32:56.027 --> 03:32:58.387
and that she's just going to walk in and check

03:32:58.387 --> 03:33:03.087
out the most rare artifact known to the Empire.

03:33:03.087 --> 03:33:07.080
LIAM: Which-- where are our other super trustworthy allies?

03:33:07.927 --> 03:33:09.717
SAM: We don't have any.

03:33:09.717 --> 03:33:11.575
LIAM: No, we don't great options.
TALIESIN: Other people in trouble

03:33:11.575 --> 03:33:12.683
are thinking about us

03:33:12.683 --> 03:33:15.037
and going "Well, we can't trust them to handle this."

03:33:15.037 --> 03:33:16.587
I mean, we're definitely in that position.

03:33:16.587 --> 03:33:17.947
TRAVIS: They are right.

03:33:17.947 --> 03:33:18.780
TALIESIN: They're right.

03:33:18.780 --> 03:33:20.987
SAM: The Gentleman can tell us about Cree,

03:33:20.987 --> 03:33:22.607
but we already asked him about Cree

03:33:22.607 --> 03:33:24.520
and he didn't give us much, right?

03:33:24.520 --> 03:33:25.776
TALIESIN: It's above his pay grade.

03:33:25.776 --> 03:33:27.687
SAM: Yussa's super knowledgeable,

03:33:27.687 --> 03:33:29.717
but doesn't seem to want to do anything.

03:33:29.717 --> 03:33:31.557
Allura's got her own responsibilities.

03:33:31.557 --> 03:33:33.757
We have no idea if she'll want to get involved.

03:33:33.757 --> 03:33:36.597
LAURA: I think we should talk to Yussa.
SAM: Astrid wants to help you.

03:33:36.597 --> 03:33:38.401
We were at that dinner.

03:33:38.401 --> 03:33:40.210
TRAVIS: Yussa's good.

03:33:40.210 --> 03:33:41.357
LAURA: We should really try Yussa.

03:33:41.357 --> 03:33:44.617
SAM: I do like the idea of speaking with Astrid and

03:33:45.467 --> 03:33:46.547
not the other one.

03:33:46.547 --> 03:33:48.397
TALIESIN: There's no reason why we can't explore

03:33:48.397 --> 03:33:50.407
a lot of options. We're just going to sit here

03:33:50.407 --> 03:33:53.107
and have a day to relax, we might as well

03:33:53.107 --> 03:33:54.587
call everybody we can.

03:33:54.587 --> 03:33:55.867
TRAVIS: Agreed.

03:33:55.867 --> 03:33:57.317
LIAM: Well, before we even choose

03:33:58.277 --> 03:33:59.577
who we're going to talk to

03:34:00.497 --> 03:34:02.197
how are we going to talk to them?

03:34:02.197 --> 03:34:03.647
SAM: I think we have to leave and come back.

03:34:03.647 --> 03:34:05.227
LIAM: Because we can leave and then

03:34:05.227 --> 03:34:08.210
we can dance around any place we'd like.

03:34:09.117 --> 03:34:10.680
Coming back is the difficulty.

03:34:11.717 --> 03:34:13.140
Not impossible, but--

03:34:14.754 --> 03:34:16.497
I don't know. Essek says that--

03:34:16.497 --> 03:34:17.417
LAURA: He's done it.

03:34:17.417 --> 03:34:18.784
LIAM: He's done it.

03:34:18.784 --> 03:34:20.450
He said you might go a little off course.

03:34:21.507 --> 03:34:22.340
SAM: That's not so bad.

03:34:22.340 --> 03:34:23.867
LIAM: I just don't want to steer us straight inside

03:34:23.867 --> 03:34:26.027
of a mountain's side.

03:34:26.027 --> 03:34:28.465
SAM: With your magic, we'll be fine.

03:34:28.465 --> 03:34:29.590
LAURA: You're so powerful, Caleb.

03:34:29.590 --> 03:34:31.277
SAM: You're so powerful!

03:34:31.277 --> 03:34:34.727
LAURA: Just give, you know, get something from here

03:34:34.727 --> 03:34:36.292
so we have something from here.

03:34:36.292 --> 03:34:37.512
SAM: Yep, yep.

03:34:37.512 --> 03:34:40.972
LAURA: I'll Guide you, he'll Bless you, we'll be set.

03:34:41.877 --> 03:34:44.427
TRAVIS: Maybe some of us should stay while the others go.

03:34:46.837 --> 03:34:49.567
SAM: Shut your fucking mouth, that's stupid.

03:34:49.567 --> 03:34:50.667
TALIESIN: How does that help any?

03:34:50.667 --> 03:34:55.665
(laughter)

03:34:57.747 --> 03:34:58.837
SAM: We're a team.

03:34:58.837 --> 03:35:01.827
LIAM: Yes, but all of the pieces on the chessboard

03:35:01.827 --> 03:35:02.967
are very dangerous.

03:35:02.967 --> 03:35:05.207
I don't like the idea of us splitting up, Veth.

03:35:05.207 --> 03:35:06.046
TALIESIN: No.

03:35:06.046 --> 03:35:06.879
SAM: No.

03:35:06.879 --> 03:35:09.595
We're the Mighty Nein; there's nine of us, you know?

03:35:09.595 --> 03:35:10.428
LAURA: (giggles)

03:35:10.428 --> 03:35:11.261
TALIESIN: There's--

03:35:12.177 --> 03:35:15.237
LIAM: Well, why don't we start in Nicodranas,

03:35:15.237 --> 03:35:20.237
because that is a very low stress first meeting?

03:35:21.737 --> 03:35:26.117
Going to Trent, or to Astrid, or Eadwulf--

03:35:26.117 --> 03:35:29.197
and Astrid and Eadwulf most likely lead to Trent anyway,

03:35:29.197 --> 03:35:30.030
or might.

03:35:31.097 --> 03:35:32.187
That's harder.

03:35:32.187 --> 03:35:36.617
But a little tea and yogurt with Yussa

03:35:36.617 --> 03:35:39.390
and maybe we find out a little useful information.

03:35:40.447 --> 03:35:41.422
LAURA: God, we need to--

03:35:41.422 --> 03:35:43.117
how soon do we need to be back here?

03:35:43.117 --> 03:35:45.607
Like, we really need to pay attention to it because--

03:35:45.607 --> 03:35:48.067
LIAM: We're guessing a week, but that's a guess.

03:35:48.067 --> 03:35:49.783
TRAVIS: And you're guessing that, you know,

03:35:49.783 --> 03:35:50.758
when we try to come back

03:35:50.758 --> 03:35:53.180
it doesn't put us three days away.

03:35:54.157 --> 03:35:57.257
SAM: Oh shit, if we're going to Nicodranas

03:35:58.677 --> 03:36:01.170
I <i>have</i> to bring a present for my kid.

03:36:02.067 --> 03:36:04.557
Is there anything around here?

03:36:04.557 --> 03:36:06.747
Or like, did we get anything?

03:36:06.747 --> 03:36:09.675
Is there anything I can steal around here?

03:36:09.675 --> 03:36:11.783
LAURA: What about one of those little intuit--

03:36:11.783 --> 03:36:13.008
LIAM: Intuit charges?
LAURA: Yeah.

03:36:13.008 --> 03:36:14.677
MARISHA: Oh my god.

03:36:14.677 --> 03:36:17.490
(laughter)

03:36:17.490 --> 03:36:18.473
MATT: "Wow, Mom, thank you!"

03:36:18.473 --> 03:36:21.448
Smash cut to outside street, everyone just drops dead.

03:36:22.657 --> 03:36:24.637
TALIESIN: Cut to the cover of Akira.

03:36:24.637 --> 03:36:29.515
ASHLEY: I have a small clay doggy from Thaydeen's.

03:36:29.515 --> 03:36:30.578
SAM: Who's Nadine?

03:36:30.578 --> 03:36:31.411
ASHLEY: Thaydeen.

03:36:31.411 --> 03:36:32.249
SAM: Who's Thaydeen?

03:36:32.249 --> 03:36:35.052
ASHLEY: Thaydeen is where we got all the amazing--

03:36:35.052 --> 03:36:36.956
SAM: Oh is that the oops-stones place?
LIAM: Joke shop.

03:36:36.956 --> 03:36:38.014
TRAVIS: The emporium?

03:36:38.014 --> 03:36:39.797
ASHLEY: It's just this little clay doggy.

03:36:39.797 --> 03:36:41.107
SAM: It's just a clay doggy?

03:36:41.107 --> 03:36:41.940
Does it do anything?

03:36:41.940 --> 03:36:44.268
ASHLEY: I bought two of them.
SAM: Great!

03:36:44.268 --> 03:36:46.298
ASHLEY: It could do something, I don't know.

03:36:46.298 --> 03:36:47.530
SAM: Gimme! One.

03:36:47.530 --> 03:36:48.549
ASHLEY: Just one?

03:36:48.549 --> 03:36:49.860
Just take them both.
SAM: Okay.

03:36:49.860 --> 03:36:50.693
ASHLEY: I don't need them.

03:36:50.693 --> 03:36:52.198
LIAM: Bring him some snowballs.

03:36:52.198 --> 03:36:53.720
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

03:36:53.720 --> 03:36:54.847
SAM: They might melt.

03:36:54.847 --> 03:36:56.907
LIAM: They will melt.
LAURA: Yeah, but not instantly.

03:36:56.907 --> 03:36:58.782
SAM: Fjord, could you make a snowball

03:36:58.782 --> 03:37:01.065
last a little bit longer?

03:37:02.117 --> 03:37:03.757
TRAVIS: I don't think so, unfortunately.

03:37:03.757 --> 03:37:05.737
SAM: You melted 30 feet of snow,

03:37:05.737 --> 03:37:08.050
you can't make a snowball fucking last an hour?

03:37:08.050 --> 03:37:08.889
Jesus.

03:37:08.889 --> 03:37:11.127
(laughter)

03:37:11.127 --> 03:37:12.487
MATT: What use <i>are</i> you?

03:37:12.487 --> 03:37:13.561
TRAVIS: I'm not sure.

03:37:13.561 --> 03:37:15.987
(laughter)

03:37:15.987 --> 03:37:18.545
TRAVIS: I could add some snow to it.

03:37:18.545 --> 03:37:20.917
It wouldn't last longer.

03:37:20.917 --> 03:37:22.847
SAM: No, it's fine, it's fine.

03:37:22.847 --> 03:37:25.477
I'll do it with my first--

03:37:25.477 --> 03:37:27.287
my cantrip, Shape Water.

03:37:27.287 --> 03:37:29.667
It's the easiest fucking spell I know.

03:37:29.667 --> 03:37:32.057
I can make a snowball and make it last an hour.

03:37:32.057 --> 03:37:33.076
Fuck you.

03:37:33.076 --> 03:37:38.076
(laughter)

03:37:38.276 --> 03:37:39.401
TRAVIS: I though we were really--

03:37:39.401 --> 03:37:40.732
TALIESIN: It's the most passive-aggressive snowball.

03:37:40.732 --> 03:37:42.331
TRAVIS: -- taking strides

03:37:43.245 --> 03:37:44.860
in this relationship.

03:37:44.860 --> 03:37:46.573
LAURA: The most one-sided argument.

03:37:46.573 --> 03:37:49.606
(laughter)

03:37:49.606 --> 03:37:52.805
TRAVIS: Fjord just questions himself for the next hour.

03:37:52.805 --> 03:37:55.213
Takes one point of psychic damage.

03:37:59.207 --> 03:38:00.957
TALIESIN: I've got some thoughts.

03:38:00.957 --> 03:38:03.147
Do we want to know where the entrance is,

03:38:03.147 --> 03:38:05.490
the second entrance, or do we want it closed?

03:38:06.800 --> 03:38:07.990
What would be better?

03:38:07.990 --> 03:38:08.823
SAM: Oh.

03:38:09.757 --> 03:38:11.687
Are you going to ask your god?

03:38:11.687 --> 03:38:13.785
TALIESIN: We both have one shot today.

03:38:13.785 --> 03:38:15.450
LAURA: Oh, yeah.

03:38:16.900 --> 03:38:17.942
TALIESIN: Do we want to know where it is

03:38:17.942 --> 03:38:21.747
or do we want to know that it's buried?

03:38:21.747 --> 03:38:24.617
TRAVIS: Yeah, hidden feels like even if they go looking

03:38:24.617 --> 03:38:27.367
for it, there's a chance they might not find it.

03:38:27.367 --> 03:38:29.987
So buried at least redirects them

03:38:29.987 --> 03:38:31.680
potentially closer to us?

03:38:32.801 --> 03:38:33.634
MARISHA: I like it.

03:38:34.587 --> 03:38:36.037
TALIESIN: That's what I'm asking for.

03:38:37.177 --> 03:38:38.010
LIAM: If it gets buried,

03:38:38.010 --> 03:38:39.527
but we still don't know where it is--

03:38:39.527 --> 03:38:40.585
TALIESIN: We may not,

03:38:40.585 --> 03:38:43.326
unless there's a rock slide that happens

03:38:43.326 --> 03:38:45.307
that alerts everybody to where it is.

03:38:45.307 --> 03:38:48.477
TRAVIS: He's got an eye for that. Anti rock slide.

03:38:48.477 --> 03:38:51.957
TALIESIN: But this may-- this is just closing off a--

03:38:51.957 --> 03:38:53.007
LIAM: Counter rock slide.

03:38:53.957 --> 03:38:56.837
LAURA: What if that entrance is the one that leads

03:38:56.837 --> 03:39:00.167
to the place that they have to take the crests?

03:39:00.167 --> 03:39:01.000
I mean--

03:39:01.997 --> 03:39:03.467
TALIESIN: They're going to be stuck there for a while

03:39:03.467 --> 03:39:05.782
getting through there then, making a ruckus.

03:39:08.441 --> 03:39:09.691
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:39:09.691 --> 03:39:10.524
TALIESIN: What do you think?

03:39:10.524 --> 03:39:12.981
Know where it is or close it?

03:39:12.981 --> 03:39:14.350
I'm so out of my depth.

03:39:14.350 --> 03:39:16.061
LAURA: I think know where it is is good.

03:39:16.061 --> 03:39:18.181
TALIESIN: I do too.
TRAVIS: This is the Hail Mary, the oner?

03:39:18.181 --> 03:39:20.321
LAURA: Yeah, we'll see if it works.

03:39:20.321 --> 03:39:22.471
LIAM: I'm worried it gets buried, they have all the time

03:39:22.471 --> 03:39:23.431
in the world to dig it out,

03:39:23.431 --> 03:39:25.031
and we still have no clue where it is.

03:39:25.031 --> 03:39:26.831
SAM: If we know where it is, we can lay a trap.

03:39:26.831 --> 03:39:29.331
TALIESIN: This is why I surround myself with smart people.

03:39:30.442 --> 03:39:31.591
Oh.

03:39:31.591 --> 03:39:32.601
SAM: Oh boy.

03:39:32.601 --> 03:39:33.434
TALIESIN: All right.

03:39:35.625 --> 03:39:37.224
I would love--

03:39:37.224 --> 03:39:40.721
LIAM: Gods above, please help us.

03:39:40.721 --> 03:39:42.171
LAURA: God standing right next to me--

03:39:42.171 --> 03:39:44.198
TALIESIN: Can you show us--
LAURA: -- please help us.

03:39:44.198 --> 03:39:45.031
TALIESIN: Do you want to go first

03:39:45.031 --> 03:39:47.083
or should I?
TRAVIS: Ah!

03:39:47.083 --> 03:39:48.628
LAURA: Sure. Hey, Arty!
TRAVIS: Don't do that.

03:39:48.628 --> 03:39:49.461
LAURA: Are you here?

03:39:49.461 --> 03:39:50.294
SAM: Arty?

03:39:51.551 --> 03:39:53.451
LAURA: All right, I got a question for you.

03:39:54.549 --> 03:39:56.799
(laughter)

03:39:57.731 --> 03:39:59.231
98.

03:39:59.231 --> 03:40:02.384
I think that is above my level,

03:40:02.384 --> 03:40:04.471
a little bit.
MATT: You hear a voice go,

03:40:04.471 --> 03:40:05.731
"I'm sorry, I wasn't paying attention.

03:40:05.731 --> 03:40:06.658
"What's going on?"

03:40:06.658 --> 03:40:09.191
LAURA: Oh, nothing. How's your day going?

03:40:09.191 --> 03:40:10.121
MATT: "Splendid, actually.

03:40:10.121 --> 03:40:11.861
"Been spending a bit of it quite out

03:40:11.861 --> 03:40:13.931
in the south side of Port Damali,

03:40:13.931 --> 03:40:15.641
having a Mai Tai, it's delightful.

03:40:15.641 --> 03:40:17.731
MARISHA: Oh, fuck you.
LIAM: Oh, man.

03:40:17.731 --> 03:40:19.474
MARISHA: That sounds so good.
LAURA: Hey, can you teleport

03:40:19.474 --> 03:40:21.849
in here real super easy?

03:40:26.391 --> 03:40:28.261
MATT: You don't hear anything, you glance to your left,

03:40:28.261 --> 03:40:31.291
and you see Artagan is sitting there right next to you,

03:40:31.291 --> 03:40:34.561
holding this awesome glass tropical drink.

03:40:34.561 --> 03:40:36.301
LIAM: So jealous.
LAURA: Gimme a sip!

03:40:36.301 --> 03:40:38.641
No, just kidding, I don't care about that.

03:40:38.641 --> 03:40:39.474
MATT: "Yeah, you do."

03:40:40.441 --> 03:40:43.321
LAURA: How did you get here super easy?

03:40:43.321 --> 03:40:44.381
MATT: "Because I can."

03:40:44.381 --> 03:40:47.482
LAURA: No, but if you can teleport in,

03:40:47.482 --> 03:40:50.071
you know it's, like, super hard to do here?

03:40:50.071 --> 03:40:51.246
MATT: "Is it?"

03:40:51.246 --> 03:40:54.033
(laughter)

03:40:54.033 --> 03:40:56.501
LAURA: Can you teleport all of us in later,

03:40:56.501 --> 03:40:57.988
if we teleport out?

03:40:59.801 --> 03:41:02.218
MATT: "I don't-- I-- can you?"

03:41:05.337 --> 03:41:07.431
TRAVIS: (slurping)
(laughter)

03:41:07.431 --> 03:41:08.264
MATT: He's still holding it out. He's like,

03:41:08.264 --> 03:41:09.154
"I thought you wanted a sip."

03:41:09.154 --> 03:41:10.198
LAURA: I would.

03:41:10.198 --> 03:41:11.031
MATT: "Here."

03:41:12.739 --> 03:41:14.641
LAURA: I don't even like alcohol.

03:41:14.641 --> 03:41:16.161
MATT: "Then don't drink it!" He takes it back

03:41:16.161 --> 03:41:17.941
before you get a sip out.

03:41:17.941 --> 03:41:20.831
LAURA: I'm just saying if you could teleport in,

03:41:20.831 --> 03:41:23.491
then why can't you just teleport us all in later?

03:41:23.491 --> 03:41:26.754
MATT: "It's not that I'm teleporting, I'm just here."

03:41:28.701 --> 03:41:32.013
LAURA: Well, I don't understand.

03:41:32.013 --> 03:41:33.746
MATT: "Yeah, well, that's all right."

03:41:33.746 --> 03:41:34.579
TALIESIN: I get it.

03:41:34.579 --> 03:41:37.511
MATT: "It's a little intense to really grasp

03:41:37.511 --> 03:41:40.471
"the concept of such fey powers.

03:41:40.471 --> 03:41:43.668
"I don't use magic to transport."

03:41:43.668 --> 03:41:44.891
LAURA: You don't?!

03:41:44.891 --> 03:41:46.337
MATT: "No, I'm just here now."

03:41:47.875 --> 03:41:49.017
LIAM: It's just fabulous.

03:41:51.561 --> 03:41:53.771
MATT: "You're the magic ones, silly mortals."

03:41:53.771 --> 03:41:55.911
TRAVIS: Your hair looks good, given the humidity.

03:41:55.911 --> 03:41:56.744
MATT: "Oh, thank you.

03:41:56.744 --> 03:41:59.902
"Oh, the moisture does nothing to me."

03:41:59.902 --> 03:42:00.781
LAURA: (laughs)

03:42:00.781 --> 03:42:02.439
MATT: "Spend enough of your life around odd,

03:42:02.439 --> 03:42:03.621
"swimming waterfalls,

03:42:03.621 --> 03:42:05.961
"it just keeps it coifed regardless."

03:42:05.961 --> 03:42:07.041
LIAM: Have you ever straightened it out?

03:42:07.041 --> 03:42:08.581
How long is it?

03:42:08.581 --> 03:42:10.001
MATT: "I don't know, actually."

03:42:10.001 --> 03:42:11.541
LAURA: Ooh, you should do it, try it right now.

03:42:11.541 --> 03:42:12.632
MATT: "Oh, but I like the volume."

03:42:12.632 --> 03:42:13.657
(laughter)

03:42:13.657 --> 03:42:16.729
LAURA: It could go right back, can't it?

03:42:16.729 --> 03:42:17.679
MATT: "Now I'm curious."

03:42:17.679 --> 03:42:19.651
TALIESIN: This is the best failed divine intervention ever.

03:42:19.651 --> 03:42:20.661
MATT: Yep.
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:42:20.661 --> 03:42:22.851
TRAVIS: He's just hanging around, you're like, "Cool."

03:42:22.851 --> 03:42:25.121
MATT: He snaps his fingers and the hair goes (whoomph)

03:42:25.121 --> 03:42:27.491
and falls into this long straight streak

03:42:27.491 --> 03:42:28.571
that goes down to his ankles.
SAM: Ugh.

03:42:28.571 --> 03:42:30.068
MATT: He goes, "Oh."

03:42:30.068 --> 03:42:31.297
LIAM: All right, Axl Rose.

03:42:31.297 --> 03:42:33.091
LAURA: That is impressive.

03:42:33.091 --> 03:42:34.931
MATT: "It looks terrible."

03:42:34.931 --> 03:42:36.031
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: He snaps again,

03:42:36.031 --> 03:42:37.851
(poof) it pops back up. He goes,

03:42:37.851 --> 03:42:38.959
"Ah, well, it was worth a shot.

03:42:38.959 --> 03:42:40.551
"Now we know, don't we?

03:42:40.551 --> 03:42:43.312
"Anyway, sorry, I was mid-conversation with someone.

03:42:43.312 --> 03:42:44.779
"Do let me know if you need anything."

03:42:44.779 --> 03:42:45.612
LAURA: Yeah.

03:42:45.612 --> 03:42:46.862
MATT: "It's chilly around here.

03:42:46.862 --> 03:42:47.840
"Stay warm, friends."

03:42:47.840 --> 03:42:49.921
(whooshing) And he's gone.

03:42:49.921 --> 03:42:50.762
TALIESIN: I like him.

03:42:50.762 --> 03:42:53.168
LIAM: Welcome to the jungle, we've got fun and games.

03:42:53.168 --> 03:42:56.891
(laughter)

03:42:56.891 --> 03:42:58.961
TALIESIN: I will give a quick prayer to the Wild Mother to--

03:42:58.961 --> 03:43:01.231
TRAVIS: Let's go, Wild Mother!
TALIESIN: -- reveal the location

03:43:01.231 --> 03:43:02.641
of the hidden fortress.

03:43:02.641 --> 03:43:04.761
LIAM: Everybody take a knee.

03:43:04.761 --> 03:43:05.594
TRAVIS: Gather up.

03:43:05.594 --> 03:43:07.361
LAURA: Did you succeed, did you succeed?

03:43:07.361 --> 03:43:09.911
TALIESIN: So just double checking,

03:43:09.911 --> 03:43:12.834
I need a 00 or a 01.

03:43:14.251 --> 03:43:18.301
And then I need-- if there's a 01,

03:43:18.301 --> 03:43:20.241
I then need a three or lower.

03:43:20.241 --> 03:43:22.837
Or if there's two zeros, I just need anything else, right?

03:43:22.837 --> 03:43:23.951
TRAVIS: What the fuck did you just say?

03:43:23.951 --> 03:43:25.341
MATT: I don't, none of that.

03:43:25.341 --> 03:43:27.881
You need to roll, either--

03:43:27.881 --> 03:43:30.321
okay, so you have the 00.

03:43:30.321 --> 03:43:31.154
TALIESIN: Yes.

03:43:31.154 --> 03:43:32.237
MATT: You get that?
TALIESIN: I did.

03:43:32.237 --> 03:43:33.139
MATT: And what's the other number?

03:43:33.139 --> 03:43:34.171
TALIESIN: Three.

03:43:34.171 --> 03:43:35.468
MATT: That's a three, that's a success.

03:43:35.468 --> 03:43:38.463
(cheering)

03:43:38.463 --> 03:43:40.181
TALIESIN: I was trying not to get my own hopes up.

03:43:40.181 --> 03:43:41.014
MATT: Fair enough.

03:43:41.014 --> 03:43:41.847
That's a success.

03:43:41.847 --> 03:43:43.119
MARISHA: In case it was 103?

03:43:43.119 --> 03:43:44.001
TALIESIN: I was just staring at them.

03:43:44.001 --> 03:43:45.261
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah.

03:43:45.261 --> 03:43:46.865
TALIESIN: My eyes are starting to fail me,

03:43:46.865 --> 03:43:49.011
'cause I'm getting old and I don't remember how math works.

03:43:49.011 --> 03:43:50.178
TRAVIS: The hell you said.

03:43:50.178 --> 03:43:52.311
MATT: So you all watch as Caduceus sits there and you go,

03:43:52.311 --> 03:43:54.731
"Well, Caduceus, yeah, go Wild Mother!"

03:43:54.731 --> 03:43:56.231
And he goes, "Okay."

03:43:56.231 --> 03:43:57.064
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:43:57.064 --> 03:43:58.218
MATT: (explosion)

03:43:58.218 --> 03:43:59.051
(laughter)

03:43:59.051 --> 03:44:00.921
MATT: All of a sudden, his hair blows back,

03:44:00.921 --> 03:44:03.382
his eyes just go bright white,

03:44:03.382 --> 03:44:05.824
and starts lifting up like Highlander for a second.

03:44:05.824 --> 03:44:06.724
He goes (whooshing).

03:44:06.724 --> 03:44:11.408
You swear you can hear voices go (angelic singing).

03:44:11.408 --> 03:44:13.001
The wind in the room begins to pick up.

03:44:13.001 --> 03:44:15.022
TRAVIS: I reach over, try and grab
him-- it's like lightning hits.

03:44:15.022 --> 03:44:17.011
(laughter)

03:44:17.011 --> 03:44:18.982
LIAM: Yes, Caduceus, there is a Santa Claus.

03:44:18.982 --> 03:44:19.815
(laughter)

03:44:19.815 --> 03:44:21.462
TALIESIN: My hair is terrible.

03:44:21.462 --> 03:44:23.711
(laughter)

03:44:23.711 --> 03:44:25.461
MATT: Twice in two minutes, two people.

03:44:26.301 --> 03:44:28.971
So in that moment, all of a sudden you feel

03:44:28.971 --> 03:44:31.201
like your consciousness is plucked from your mind

03:44:31.201 --> 03:44:32.751
for a moment and stretched,

03:44:32.751 --> 03:44:36.111
like someone just streaked paint across a wall,

03:44:36.111 --> 03:44:37.361
but it's your mind.

03:44:37.361 --> 03:44:39.191
And as it does, you, all of a sudden,

03:44:39.191 --> 03:44:43.211
can see the entire size of this valley,

03:44:43.211 --> 03:44:46.471
the somewhat oval, oblong shape

03:44:46.471 --> 03:44:48.651
of this odd, discolored ice sheet

03:44:48.651 --> 03:44:51.411
that fills the entirety of this valley.

03:44:51.411 --> 03:44:53.841
You feel yourself punch downward

03:44:53.841 --> 03:44:56.371
towards the Northwestern edge of it.

03:44:56.371 --> 03:45:01.201
And there you can see a very, very clear image

03:45:01.201 --> 03:45:03.471
of this ice shelf that begins to push out,

03:45:03.471 --> 03:45:05.191
like two different glaciers

03:45:05.191 --> 03:45:06.261
have been pressed against each other,

03:45:06.261 --> 03:45:08.581
and one's pushed the other up at this odd cliff.

03:45:08.581 --> 03:45:11.311
And along the cliff, you can see broken ruins,

03:45:11.311 --> 03:45:13.411
sets of stairs that have pushed through the ice.

03:45:13.411 --> 03:45:14.851
You can see fallen columns,

03:45:14.851 --> 03:45:18.771
and you can see just massive amounts of of broken stone

03:45:18.771 --> 03:45:21.391
and ice, and hoarfrost,

03:45:21.391 --> 03:45:23.091
and it is a scattering bit.

03:45:23.091 --> 03:45:26.271
And you can see behind one of these rock shelves

03:45:26.271 --> 03:45:29.841
there is a carved tunnel,

03:45:29.841 --> 03:45:32.521
where some of the snow and the rock has collapsed inward.

03:45:32.521 --> 03:45:35.241
A small sinkhole that has opened a pathway

03:45:35.241 --> 03:45:36.841
that is not visible from the outside,

03:45:36.841 --> 03:45:38.581
but from behind and within,

03:45:38.581 --> 03:45:41.821
it seems to descend inward and you (whooshing),

03:45:41.821 --> 03:45:42.701
pull back into yourself.

03:45:42.701 --> 03:45:43.992
Right as your feet touch the ground,

03:45:43.992 --> 03:45:47.831
the wind stops, the strange divine channeling

03:45:47.831 --> 03:45:50.451
that you've never quite seen as intensely as that

03:45:50.451 --> 03:45:53.501
from Caduceus, leaves him there somewhat breathless.

03:45:53.501 --> 03:45:56.271
And you have burned, seared into your mind

03:45:56.271 --> 03:45:58.157
exactly where that entrance is.

03:45:58.157 --> 03:45:59.388
LIAM: Damn.
MARISHA: Amazing.

03:45:59.388 --> 03:46:00.221
LAURA: (clapping)
SAM: Wow.

03:46:00.221 --> 03:46:02.237
ASHLEY: That is awesome.

03:46:04.261 --> 03:46:06.061
TALIESIN: Okay, so I now know where that is.

03:46:07.381 --> 03:46:09.293
Can I get a piece of paper or something?

03:46:09.293 --> 03:46:11.241
MARISHA: Recite everything, write it down.

03:46:11.241 --> 03:46:12.971
TALIESIN: I'm just going to write and talk, writing--

03:46:12.971 --> 03:46:15.011
MATT: Yeah.
TALIESIN: The oval columns,

03:46:15.011 --> 03:46:16.502
the shelf, hidden underneath.
LAURA: I'm going to be just trying

03:46:16.502 --> 03:46:18.185
to draw it as he's saying it.

03:46:18.185 --> 03:46:20.301
SAM: Amazing.
MATT: There you go.

03:46:20.301 --> 03:46:22.941
TRAVIS: Caduceus, you have an eye
that's appeared on your cheek.

03:46:22.941 --> 03:46:25.881
LAURA: Yeah.
(laughter)

03:46:25.881 --> 03:46:27.191
TALIESIN: Really?
TRAVIS: No.

03:46:27.191 --> 03:46:29.589
SAM: It's the letter I.

03:46:29.589 --> 03:46:30.761
MARISHA: Oh, sorry, that was some ink.

03:46:30.761 --> 03:46:31.754
I got excited.

03:46:32.596 --> 03:46:34.362
TRAVIS: You're perfect without it.

03:46:34.362 --> 03:46:35.801
TALIESIN: I'm going to remember you said that.

03:46:35.801 --> 03:46:37.661
It's going to come back to haunt you one day.

03:46:37.661 --> 03:46:38.874
You will not expect it.

03:46:40.201 --> 03:46:41.034
I have siblings.

03:46:41.034 --> 03:46:43.257
I know how to get my revenge when I need to.

03:46:43.257 --> 03:46:44.391
TRAVIS: Is that a threat from Caduceus?

03:46:44.391 --> 03:46:45.439
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.
(laughter)

03:46:45.439 --> 03:46:47.581
MARISHA: He said "shit" earlier.

03:46:47.581 --> 03:46:49.437
SAM: Whoa.
TRAVIS: He did. It's taking a toll.

03:46:49.437 --> 03:46:50.277
MARISHA: I know.

03:46:50.277 --> 03:46:51.465
He's been with us for too long.
LAURA: You said "shit" earlier?

03:46:51.465 --> 03:46:52.699
TRAVIS: You gave me this brooch.

03:46:52.699 --> 03:46:54.521
You would never damage this brooch.

03:46:54.521 --> 03:46:55.933
TALIESIN: No, the brooch will be fine.

03:46:55.933 --> 03:46:58.183
(laughter)

03:46:59.441 --> 03:47:01.411
TALIESIN: I love you like family.

03:47:01.411 --> 03:47:03.564
TRAVIS: Oh, that's not comforting.
TALIESIN: You're in such trouble.

03:47:03.564 --> 03:47:05.291
(laughter)

03:47:05.291 --> 03:47:06.671
SAM: That was incredible.

03:47:06.671 --> 03:47:09.396
TALIESIN: I've never, that was--
ASHLEY: That was very cool.

03:47:09.396 --> 03:47:10.229
TALIESIN: That was a lot.

03:47:10.229 --> 03:47:11.062
MARISHA: That was awesome.

03:47:11.062 --> 03:47:14.031
SAM: Do you feel more spiritually connected and centered?

03:47:14.031 --> 03:47:16.481
TALIESIN: I mean, I feel a little better in that direction.

03:47:17.371 --> 03:47:18.251
It's been rough out here.

03:47:18.251 --> 03:47:22.514
I'm not going to pretend it hasn't. Yeah, my--

03:47:22.514 --> 03:47:24.161
LIAM: She knew you were in need.

03:47:24.161 --> 03:47:25.352
TALIESIN: Oh, this is terrible.

03:47:25.352 --> 03:47:26.832
MATT: Need to cut that track.

03:47:27.781 --> 03:47:30.351
TALIESIN: I'll need to fix this, but--

03:47:30.351 --> 03:47:32.810
LAURA: Oh, it looks great.

03:47:32.810 --> 03:47:34.698
SAM: Yeah.
TALIESIN: I'll take your word for it.

03:47:34.698 --> 03:47:37.316
LAURA: I'm going to pull out my brush from my haversack

03:47:37.316 --> 03:47:39.871
and start fixing Caduceus.

03:47:39.871 --> 03:47:41.375
TALIESIN: Oh, that feels really good.

03:47:41.375 --> 03:47:42.231
LAURA: Yeah.

03:47:42.231 --> 03:47:44.499
TALIESIN: So, now that we know that--

03:47:44.499 --> 03:47:45.831
(groaning)

03:47:45.831 --> 03:47:47.901
LAURA: Oh no, wake up, wake up, wake up.

03:47:47.901 --> 03:47:48.819
Keep talking.

03:47:48.819 --> 03:47:51.731
SAM: Is that information that we want to act on now?

03:47:51.731 --> 03:47:54.361
Or we should leave, go get allies,

03:47:54.361 --> 03:47:56.041
and come back and set up camp there

03:47:56.041 --> 03:47:58.191
and wait for them to arrive, and--

03:47:58.191 --> 03:48:01.078
TALIESIN: We could let them know where it is

03:48:01.078 --> 03:48:03.562
and then they can start patrolling.

03:48:03.562 --> 03:48:05.984
Or we could go set up a line.

03:48:06.951 --> 03:48:08.801
So we'll know when they enter.

03:48:08.801 --> 03:48:09.772
LAURA: Does it stay?
MARISHA: I don't think

03:48:09.772 --> 03:48:11.331
it lasts that long.
LAURA: Over many days?

03:48:11.331 --> 03:48:12.164
LIAM: What are we talking about?

03:48:12.164 --> 03:48:13.295
SAM: Alarm.
TRAVIS: Your silver thread.

03:48:13.295 --> 03:48:14.434
LIAM: Alarm...

03:48:16.071 --> 03:48:17.253
LAURA: We could set a ward.

03:48:17.253 --> 03:48:19.055
TALIESIN: We could set a ward.

03:48:19.055 --> 03:48:21.455
I've never made a ward before.
SAM: Or our bombs.

03:48:21.455 --> 03:48:22.921
We have a bunch of bombs.

03:48:22.921 --> 03:48:23.891
TALIESIN: A ward and a bomb.

03:48:23.891 --> 03:48:25.880
LIAM: No.
TALIESIN: Bomb Ward.

03:48:25.880 --> 03:48:30.093
TRAVIS: The Kryn are just patrolling. (explosion)

03:48:30.093 --> 03:48:32.684
SAM: I found it, sir, ah!

03:48:32.684 --> 03:48:34.696
TALIESIN: Perhaps, maybe not--
MARISHA: We should have picked one. Oh no!

03:48:34.696 --> 03:48:36.175
MATT: This little snow bunny's out there.

03:48:36.175 --> 03:48:39.508
(laughter)

03:48:39.508 --> 03:48:41.501
TALIESIN: (squeaky death noises)
(laughter)

03:48:41.501 --> 03:48:43.993
MARISHA: Just psychic damage.
TRAVIS: Massive detonation,

03:48:43.993 --> 03:48:46.191
one dead bunny.
TALIESIN: What did it see before it died?

03:48:46.191 --> 03:48:48.091
What did the bunny see?

03:48:48.091 --> 03:48:51.202
What was so terrible to it that it couldn't live?

03:48:51.202 --> 03:48:54.991
(laughter)

03:48:54.991 --> 03:48:55.824
LIAM: Did we just skip

03:48:55.824 --> 03:48:57.811
ourselves a trip back to the Empire?
TALIESIN: The rabbit version of Watchmen.

03:48:57.811 --> 03:48:59.661
SAM: No, we still have to go to the Empire.

03:48:59.661 --> 03:49:03.261
We still need, we still need allies.

03:49:03.261 --> 03:49:04.094
What are we going to do?

03:49:04.094 --> 03:49:06.151
Just sit there for two weeks waiting for them?

03:49:06.151 --> 03:49:07.535
We need more information.

03:49:07.535 --> 03:49:10.382
(laughter)

03:49:10.382 --> 03:49:11.215
TRAVIS: Well--

03:49:12.531 --> 03:49:16.526
LAURA: Your mustache!
(laughter)

03:49:17.771 --> 03:49:19.051
TALIESIN: Just don't look; that's what the rest of us do.

03:49:19.051 --> 03:49:21.074
SAM: I love it when a woman I respect

03:49:21.074 --> 03:49:22.893
laughs at me for no reason.

03:49:22.893 --> 03:49:27.860
(laughter)

03:49:29.211 --> 03:49:31.593
TRAVIS: Oh shit!
SAM: It's the greatest.

03:49:31.593 --> 03:49:36.576
(laughter)

03:49:39.988 --> 03:49:41.681
MATT: To be fair, it's something about the mustache

03:49:41.681 --> 03:49:44.268
and just your smile combination that's very, like--

03:49:44.268 --> 03:49:45.501
(laughter)

03:49:45.501 --> 03:49:48.460
I don't know, Pringles guy or Monopoly dude.

03:49:48.460 --> 03:49:51.271
It just has a very cartoony shape.
LIAM: 1930's cartoon villain.

03:49:51.271 --> 03:49:52.871
MATT: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Planters Peanut guy.

03:49:52.871 --> 03:49:54.287
MATT: Yeah.

03:49:54.287 --> 03:49:56.145
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's hard. Like, with--

03:49:56.145 --> 03:49:58.401
It's hard to know who of these sources:

03:49:58.401 --> 03:50:01.251
Trent, Ludinus, Bright Queen, Yussa, Astrid,

03:50:01.251 --> 03:50:03.961
like, who might actually trigger on any of these things.

03:50:03.961 --> 03:50:08.961
So we should try to have as many convos as we can.

03:50:09.021 --> 03:50:10.991
MARISHA: I don't hate the idea of starting with Yussa,

03:50:10.991 --> 03:50:14.641
because Yussa has contacts with Allura,

03:50:14.641 --> 03:50:17.131
and Yussa also has the happy fun ball,

03:50:17.131 --> 03:50:19.141
which has Halas still in it.

03:50:19.141 --> 03:50:21.705
So we can kill three birds with one stone.

03:50:21.705 --> 03:50:22.538
LAURA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Mm!

03:50:23.881 --> 03:50:25.331
LIAM: Trying to get to Halas is

03:50:25.331 --> 03:50:27.358
a very unpredictable gambit, though.

03:50:27.358 --> 03:50:28.371
LAURA: Yeah, that would be a thing.

03:50:28.371 --> 03:50:29.681
MARISHA: But he is also technically

03:50:29.681 --> 03:50:31.839
the only living person that we know--

03:50:31.839 --> 03:50:33.805
"living"-- from that time.

03:50:33.805 --> 03:50:36.251
LAURA: Yeah, but the time is so different in the ball.

03:50:36.251 --> 03:50:38.790
Remember? How much time.
LIAM: Yeah, that's the thing.

03:50:38.790 --> 03:50:40.813
LAURA: We could go in the ball and come out--

03:50:40.813 --> 03:50:42.453
TRAVIS: It's over.
LAURA: Lucien will have already

03:50:42.453 --> 03:50:45.175
brought the city back.

03:50:45.175 --> 03:50:46.081
MARISHA: What's over?

03:50:46.081 --> 03:50:47.931
TRAVIS: No, it could be over if we go into the ball.

03:50:47.931 --> 03:50:48.801
MARISHA: Oh yeah.

03:50:48.801 --> 03:50:50.251
TRAVIS: Time passes too quick, it's over.

03:50:50.251 --> 03:50:51.751
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:50:51.751 --> 03:50:54.421
TALIESIN: Just Planet of the Apes at that point.

03:50:54.421 --> 03:50:56.281
LAURA: But at this point, it's been so long.

03:50:56.281 --> 03:50:58.851
Maybe Yussa has some knowledge about the ball.

03:50:58.851 --> 03:51:01.051
You know, it had that ability to change

03:51:01.051 --> 03:51:02.281
the passage of time within it,

03:51:02.281 --> 03:51:06.342
so maybe he knows how to fix it.

03:51:06.342 --> 03:51:07.781
LIAM: We would be asking him questions, anyway,

03:51:07.781 --> 03:51:09.161
so we could ask about that.
LAURA: Yeah.

03:51:09.161 --> 03:51:10.891
MARISHA: Yussa wasn't interested in getting involved

03:51:10.891 --> 03:51:12.917
in any type of politics or the war.

03:51:12.917 --> 03:51:14.050
LAURA: This isn't about politics.

03:51:14.050 --> 03:51:15.453
MARISHA: But this is different.

03:51:15.453 --> 03:51:17.651
LAURA: Yeah.

03:51:17.651 --> 03:51:18.894
TALIESIN: This is ancient magic.
LAURA: Plus,

03:51:18.894 --> 03:51:20.771
there's lots of shit for him to find.

03:51:20.771 --> 03:51:22.409
I think he might like it.

03:51:22.409 --> 03:51:23.751
TRAVIS: I think so, too.

03:51:25.092 --> 03:51:26.478
MARISHA: It's the best feeling I have.

03:51:26.478 --> 03:51:29.091
TRAVIS: And then we threaten.
TALIESIN: I like it.

03:51:29.091 --> 03:51:33.849
LAURA: Should we scry on Lucien, or one of them?

03:51:33.849 --> 03:51:35.671
TRAVIS: I would like it.

03:51:35.671 --> 03:51:37.137
TALIESIN: I got a better idea.

03:51:37.137 --> 03:51:39.048
Well, I mean, what do you want to know?

03:51:39.048 --> 03:51:40.511
TRAVIS: I just want us to look at Zoran,

03:51:40.511 --> 03:51:41.771
or see if we're able to

03:51:41.771 --> 03:51:43.431
watch someone else besides Lucien

03:51:43.431 --> 03:51:45.776
who's good at shooting the eye out of the sky.

03:51:45.776 --> 03:51:47.051
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

03:51:47.051 --> 03:51:49.301
TALIESIN: What do you want to know if they're doing, though?

03:51:49.301 --> 03:51:50.151
TRAVIS: Where they're going.

03:51:50.151 --> 03:51:51.551
What direction they're heading.

03:51:51.551 --> 03:51:54.009
Are they all together? That sort of stuff.

03:51:54.009 --> 03:51:55.964
LAURA: Are you going to ask the Wild Mother again?

03:51:57.326 --> 03:51:58.202
Oh, right.

03:51:58.202 --> 03:52:00.446
TALIESIN: I mean, got some yes or no questions I can--

03:52:00.446 --> 03:52:02.411
LAURA: That's true, that's true.

03:52:02.411 --> 03:52:04.544
Oh yeah, I could do that, too.
TRAVIS: We're on the VIP list today.

03:52:04.544 --> 03:52:05.711
LAURA: Could bring him back.

03:52:07.241 --> 03:52:10.914
But I kind of want to Scry before I do that.

03:52:12.311 --> 03:52:15.801
TALIESIN: My worry about scrying is if we get that close,

03:52:15.801 --> 03:52:17.781
they can look back and know where we are.

03:52:17.781 --> 03:52:20.811
LAURA: Well, I'm wearing this wonderful pendant

03:52:20.811 --> 03:52:22.401
that keeps them from scrying on me.

03:52:22.401 --> 03:52:25.641
So if I get far enough away from all of you

03:52:25.641 --> 03:52:27.951
then they won't be able to see anything but snow.

03:52:27.951 --> 03:52:29.101
TRAVIS: Yeah, and frankly--
LAURA: Or anything.

03:52:29.101 --> 03:52:31.681
TRAVIS: We're the most protected we've been in a while,

03:52:31.681 --> 03:52:32.871
here in this place.

03:52:32.871 --> 03:52:34.111
And I don't even think they're coming here,

03:52:34.111 --> 03:52:37.137
they're going to the spot you found.

03:52:37.137 --> 03:52:40.071
LIAM: There's at least a hundred highly-trained people

03:52:40.071 --> 03:52:41.311
surrounding us right now.

03:52:41.311 --> 03:52:42.577
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:52:43.777 --> 03:52:44.921
LIAM: I am for it.

03:52:44.921 --> 03:52:47.794
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to go outside, away from everyone.

03:52:49.611 --> 03:52:54.596
And get down and Scry.

03:52:54.596 --> 03:52:56.371
(laughs)
MATT: Okay.

03:52:56.371 --> 03:52:57.661
TRAVIS: Well, not away from everyone.

03:52:57.661 --> 03:53:01.391
The last time that happened, Vess DeRogna was assassinated.

03:53:01.391 --> 03:53:02.631
Can I come with you?

03:53:02.631 --> 03:53:04.541
LAURA: No, 'cause they'll see you, Fjord.

03:53:04.541 --> 03:53:05.491
TRAVIS: That's okay.

03:53:07.040 --> 03:53:07.873
LAURA: Okay.

03:53:09.575 --> 03:53:12.834
MATT: Okay. So you set up your Scry ritual,

03:53:12.834 --> 03:53:14.647
finalize your glyphs,

03:53:14.647 --> 03:53:17.531
and who's your target?
LAURA: Lots of runes, so many runes, so many.

03:53:17.531 --> 03:53:18.681
Oh gosh, this is magic.

03:53:18.681 --> 03:53:19.711
This might be hard to do.

03:53:19.711 --> 03:53:20.854
We'll find out.

03:53:22.901 --> 03:53:23.901
MATT: Who's your target?

03:53:25.091 --> 03:53:26.809
LAURA: Zoran.
MATT: Zoran.

03:53:28.011 --> 03:53:29.674
Sorry, give me just a second.

03:53:29.674 --> 03:53:30.931
TRAVIS: ♪ (dial tones) ♪

03:53:30.931 --> 03:53:34.461
We're sorry, your scry cannot be completed as dialed.

03:53:34.461 --> 03:53:35.294
MATT: Possibly.

03:53:36.941 --> 03:53:38.361
TRAVIS: Please check your runes and try again.

03:53:38.361 --> 03:53:40.314
MATT: Of course it's the last one I find, okay.

03:53:47.241 --> 03:53:48.741
Definitely didn't make his save.

03:53:51.080 --> 03:53:52.411
So you close your eyes again.

03:53:52.411 --> 03:53:54.786
You hear a voice in your mind go,

03:53:54.786 --> 03:53:56.869
(as Artagan) "Oh, right, no worries."

03:53:56.869 --> 03:53:59.603
And for a brief second, you hear a drink being set down,

03:53:59.603 --> 03:54:00.761
and then you feel yourself

03:54:00.761 --> 03:54:04.101
being lifted out of your physical self,

03:54:04.101 --> 03:54:05.131
through the cold winds,

03:54:05.131 --> 03:54:08.314
eyes still closed, and a voice goes,

03:54:08.314 --> 03:54:10.451
"Hey, open them."

03:54:10.451 --> 03:54:11.721
You open your eyes,

03:54:11.721 --> 03:54:14.204
and there you are, peering over Zoran's shoulder.

03:54:15.631 --> 03:54:17.873
There's no snow, but you hear the sound,

03:54:17.873 --> 03:54:20.469
the crunch of footfalls on snow.

03:54:20.469 --> 03:54:22.044
LAURA: Damn it, I should have Guided myself

03:54:22.044 --> 03:54:23.314
before we did this!

03:54:24.221 --> 03:54:25.244
Every time!

03:54:27.049 --> 03:54:28.019
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:54:28.019 --> 03:54:30.925
TRAVIS: She talks to herself a lot when she does this.

03:54:30.925 --> 03:54:31.995
LAURA: Fuck!

03:54:31.995 --> 03:54:32.828
TRAVIS: Oh?

03:54:34.547 --> 03:54:36.076
(imitates lightsaber hum)

03:54:36.076 --> 03:54:36.909
LAURA: God--!

03:54:38.169 --> 03:54:40.785
It was like, (squeaking) boom.

03:54:40.785 --> 03:54:42.110
It went from 20 to two.

03:54:42.110 --> 03:54:42.943
MATT: Aww.

03:54:42.943 --> 03:54:44.561
LAURA: I know.

03:54:44.561 --> 03:54:46.024
Seven perception.

03:54:47.571 --> 03:54:50.361
MATT: I mean, in the blurred space around

03:54:50.361 --> 03:54:52.536
you can see other figures walking around Zoran,

03:54:52.536 --> 03:54:53.536
LAURA: Sure.
MATT: You can't make out details,

03:54:53.536 --> 03:54:55.121
but you gather who they are.

03:54:55.121 --> 03:54:57.651
You see him walking in snow and you see a dark shape

03:54:57.651 --> 03:54:59.621
to the right hand side

03:54:59.621 --> 03:55:01.961
that is some sort of shift in topography,

03:55:01.961 --> 03:55:03.711
but that's all you can make out in the space.

03:55:03.711 --> 03:55:05.541
LAURA: I can't hear anybody talking?

03:55:05.541 --> 03:55:06.551
Why would they be talking?

03:55:06.551 --> 03:55:08.081
MATT: There isn't a lot of conversation at the moment.

03:55:08.081 --> 03:55:10.154
Just trudging through the snow.

03:55:11.841 --> 03:55:13.761
Make a survival check.

03:55:13.761 --> 03:55:16.151
Based on the position of the light in the sky,

03:55:16.151 --> 03:55:17.361
because it is a clear sky today

03:55:17.361 --> 03:55:20.977
because of the roll that was made earlier, that does mean--

03:55:20.977 --> 03:55:23.181
TRAVIS: It's not like you can see
a particular Bag of Holding

03:55:23.181 --> 03:55:24.881
on his hip or anything, right?

03:55:24.881 --> 03:55:26.015
MATT: Not with that perception roll.

03:55:26.015 --> 03:55:27.140
TRAVIS: Fucking balls.

03:55:27.140 --> 03:55:28.264
LAURA: With this one, though.

03:55:29.181 --> 03:55:30.134
21?

03:55:31.091 --> 03:55:32.431
Oh, this is a survival check.

03:55:32.431 --> 03:55:34.061
MATT: Correct.

03:55:34.061 --> 03:55:35.139
LAURA: 21.

03:55:35.139 --> 03:55:36.364
MATT: (laughs) There you go.

03:55:38.311 --> 03:55:40.121
You gather they're traveling

03:55:40.121 --> 03:55:44.331
in a western to northwest direction,

03:55:44.331 --> 03:55:46.131
based on the placement of the light,

03:55:46.991 --> 03:55:50.321
and surmising where you last saw them

03:55:50.321 --> 03:55:52.941
and that dark shape, that might be the mountain range

03:55:52.941 --> 03:55:56.301
that you guys were at, which makes you think

03:55:56.301 --> 03:55:58.898
they're traveling away from Aeor.

03:55:58.898 --> 03:56:02.225
LAURA: Oh, yeah, they're heading to a ruin.

03:56:02.225 --> 03:56:03.654
Who are you talking to?

03:56:05.680 --> 03:56:06.551
MATT: You're asking--?

03:56:06.551 --> 03:56:10.674
LAURA: Arty, who he's talking to on the Menagerie Coast.

03:56:13.933 --> 03:56:14.766
MATT: "Oh, I'm sorry.

03:56:14.766 --> 03:56:17.821
"This is your Scry. I left you there.

03:56:17.821 --> 03:56:19.565
"I went back to my conversation."

03:56:19.565 --> 03:56:20.961
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

03:56:20.961 --> 03:56:22.561
MATT: "I'm not here to hold your hand the entire time.

03:56:22.561 --> 03:56:24.724
"I just show you the way."

03:56:24.724 --> 03:56:26.974
LAURA: (gurgling)

03:56:27.821 --> 03:56:29.281
Okay, that's all I'm getting.

03:56:29.281 --> 03:56:30.551
I rolled real shitty.

03:56:30.551 --> 03:56:32.931
I can't see anything, it's snowy.

03:56:32.931 --> 03:56:34.791
MATT: "Well, I'm sorry. I tried."

03:56:34.791 --> 03:56:35.821
LAURA: No, you helped a lot.

03:56:35.821 --> 03:56:37.621
You helped a lot.

03:56:37.621 --> 03:56:38.996
MATT: "Thank you."
LAURA: Okay.

03:56:38.996 --> 03:56:42.211
MATT: (laughs) He pulls you back into yourself.

03:56:42.211 --> 03:56:44.021
LAURA: They're heading away from us, I think.

03:56:44.021 --> 03:56:45.791
TRAVIS: Which direction?

03:56:45.791 --> 03:56:48.121
LAURA: It felt like they were going

03:56:48.121 --> 03:56:49.901
I don't know, like north, northwest

03:56:49.901 --> 03:56:50.991
based on where the sun was?

03:56:50.991 --> 03:56:51.824
Did I say that right?

03:56:51.824 --> 03:56:52.657
MATT: Yeah.
LAURA: Yeah.

03:56:52.657 --> 03:56:54.083
MATT: Approximately.

03:56:54.083 --> 03:56:58.621
SAM: That's good.
TRAVIS: That's back towards A2, though.

03:56:58.621 --> 03:56:59.454
LAURA: I dunno.

03:56:59.454 --> 03:57:01.351
It just felt like they weren't heading towards us.

03:57:01.351 --> 03:57:02.921
I don't know where the other ruins are.

03:57:02.921 --> 03:57:05.311
TALIESIN: Maybe they know ruins that we don't.

03:57:05.311 --> 03:57:06.886
TRAVIS: Maybe. They should have been heading

03:57:06.886 --> 03:57:08.911
south or southeast.

03:57:08.911 --> 03:57:10.728
TALIESIN: Well, here's the question.

03:57:10.728 --> 03:57:12.274
What do we want to ask?

03:57:14.348 --> 03:57:16.331
MARISHA: Wasn't there another ruin, though,

03:57:16.331 --> 03:57:18.921
that was on that northwest side?

03:57:18.921 --> 03:57:19.754
TRAVIS: That is A2.

03:57:19.754 --> 03:57:21.404
MARISHA: A2, that is A2, okay.

03:57:21.404 --> 03:57:23.403
SAM: Could there have been more than one

03:57:23.403 --> 03:57:25.403
threshold crest there?

03:57:26.493 --> 03:57:28.368
TRAVIS: Potentially.

03:57:28.368 --> 03:57:30.031
ASHLEY: Did we go to the question mark one?

03:57:30.031 --> 03:57:32.021
TRAVIS: We didn't. That's the far eastern.

03:57:32.021 --> 03:57:32.874
ASHLEY: That's far, far.

03:57:32.874 --> 03:57:35.528
TRAVIS: A4 is the closest that hasn't been visited,

03:57:35.528 --> 03:57:36.731
as far as we know.

03:57:36.731 --> 03:57:40.172
We assume they had A5 and we got A2.

03:57:40.172 --> 03:57:41.205
MATT: Do keep in mind too--
LAURA: Well, it's good to know that

03:57:41.205 --> 03:57:42.531
they're not coming here.

03:57:42.531 --> 03:57:45.651
MATT: It's only been a handful of hours since you saw them.

03:57:45.651 --> 03:57:46.951
LAURA: Right.
MATT: Also.

03:57:46.951 --> 03:57:47.784
So.

03:57:48.867 --> 03:57:49.700
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:57:49.700 --> 03:57:51.561
SAM: They might just be walking around--

03:57:51.561 --> 03:57:52.471
TRAVIS: Coming down the mountain.

03:57:52.471 --> 03:57:53.504
SAM: -- something, yeah.

03:57:56.851 --> 03:57:58.301
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a minute to sit

03:57:58.301 --> 03:57:59.891
and ask a couple questions.

03:57:59.891 --> 03:58:02.541
After that wonderful, wonderful moment,

03:58:02.541 --> 03:58:04.961
I figure I'm just going to roll it.

03:58:10.231 --> 03:58:11.424
The Tomb Takers,

03:58:14.051 --> 03:58:17.001
are they heading to find another threshold crest in a ruin?

03:58:18.641 --> 03:58:22.599
MATT: The cold temperature shifts into a

03:58:22.599 --> 03:58:25.341
warm, if stale, air. Confirming,

03:58:25.341 --> 03:58:27.381
though still with the apprehension

03:58:27.381 --> 03:58:32.381
of the dangers that this direction eventually holds.

03:58:36.261 --> 03:58:37.344
TALIESIN: Would you be able to tell me

03:58:37.344 --> 03:58:38.827
if they had acquired one?

03:58:41.791 --> 03:58:44.321
MATT: The temperature doesn't change, remains warm,

03:58:44.321 --> 03:58:45.666
though still stale.

03:58:50.384 --> 03:58:51.751
TALIESIN: Are they headed towards a ruin

03:58:51.751 --> 03:58:53.442
that we do not know of?

03:58:56.641 --> 03:59:00.151
MATT: The temperature lessens,

03:59:00.151 --> 03:59:04.161
not to cold, but just a standard room temperature.

03:59:04.161 --> 03:59:05.829
A non-committal unknown.

03:59:10.801 --> 03:59:12.051
TALIESIN: I'll check in every day.

03:59:12.051 --> 03:59:13.901
And I'll know when they've found one.

03:59:16.721 --> 03:59:17.554
TRAVIS: That's handy.

03:59:17.554 --> 03:59:18.387
TALIESIN: That'll--

03:59:19.770 --> 03:59:20.745
Every day.

03:59:24.441 --> 03:59:26.644
That at least I can offer.

03:59:30.491 --> 03:59:32.321
Oh, it's nice to be warm.

03:59:32.321 --> 03:59:33.154
Oh!

03:59:35.891 --> 03:59:37.551
LAURA: Should we leave tonight?

03:59:37.551 --> 03:59:38.384
LIAM: We could.

03:59:41.541 --> 03:59:43.751
TRAVIS: It has been a number of nights

03:59:43.751 --> 03:59:45.751
since we had a (clicks)

03:59:45.751 --> 03:59:48.391
super chill, stress-free rest.

03:59:48.391 --> 03:59:50.431
MARISHA: That Mai Tai looks real good.

03:59:50.431 --> 03:59:52.601
I know a good place to get one in Nicodranas.

03:59:52.601 --> 03:59:54.404
TALIESIN: Time is definitely of the essence.

03:59:55.581 --> 03:59:57.064
MARISHA: Time for a Mai Tai, though.

04:00:02.051 --> 04:00:03.209
Yeah.

04:00:03.209 --> 04:00:04.342
TALIESIN: Okay, okay.

04:00:05.841 --> 04:00:06.674
Sure.

04:00:09.481 --> 04:00:11.821
The safe way to travel would be with a circle.

04:00:11.821 --> 04:00:13.931
LIAM: Correct, to Yussa's tower.

04:00:13.931 --> 04:00:16.134
LAURA: Okay, are we going now?

04:00:17.361 --> 04:00:18.601
LIAM: Sure, we could sleep there tonight

04:00:18.601 --> 04:00:21.104
instead of in this frigid dump.

04:00:22.361 --> 04:00:24.211
LAURA: Should we tell Essek we're leaving?

04:00:25.081 --> 04:00:26.666
Tell him where the entrance is?

04:00:26.666 --> 04:00:28.691
TALIESIN: Do we have maybe a-- maybe not directly.

04:00:28.691 --> 04:00:31.462
Is there someone we can leave word with?

04:00:31.462 --> 04:00:32.379
TRAVIS: I would--

04:00:33.298 --> 04:00:35.898
LAURA: Tell him nothing.
TRAVIS: I would keep the circle close.

04:00:35.898 --> 04:00:36.898
TALIESIN: Hmm.

04:00:38.591 --> 04:00:40.701
MARISHA: Should we pay up Dagen?

04:00:42.011 --> 04:00:42.982
LAURA: Oh, he's already been paid.

04:00:42.982 --> 04:00:44.595
TRAVIS: That tab's covered, yo.

04:00:44.595 --> 04:00:45.428
MARISHA: Oh, wait, did they--?

04:00:45.428 --> 04:00:47.654
LAURA: Yeah. No, we paid it

04:00:47.654 --> 04:00:50.061
MATT: Yeah, you left it behind when you were--

04:00:50.061 --> 04:00:51.191
TALIESIN: That's actually a good idea,

04:00:51.191 --> 04:00:52.711
let's let Dagen know what we're doing

04:00:52.711 --> 04:00:53.781
and where we're going so that

04:00:53.781 --> 04:00:56.351
if there are questions, he can answer them.

04:00:56.351 --> 04:00:58.221
LIAM: As for Essek, it seems like the faster

04:00:58.221 --> 04:00:59.681
we got out of Dodge, the--

04:00:59.681 --> 04:01:01.881
TALIESIN: Better it is.
LIAM: -- more comfortable he would feel.

04:01:01.881 --> 04:01:03.191
MARISHA: Yeah, he was pretty on edge.

04:01:03.191 --> 04:01:05.461
TALIESIN: If anyone asks, we've left word,

04:01:05.461 --> 04:01:07.841
but we don't have to bother anybody with it.

04:01:07.841 --> 04:01:10.039
MARISHA: You think anyone at this outpost has a map

04:01:10.039 --> 04:01:12.082
of the ruins before we bounce?

04:01:14.451 --> 04:01:15.991
SAM: They're not going to give it to us

04:01:15.991 --> 04:01:18.266
without Essek turning it over.

04:01:19.838 --> 04:01:20.671
TRAVIS: He's already gone.

04:01:20.671 --> 04:01:23.551
MATT: You got the sense that the map to the ruins

04:01:23.551 --> 04:01:25.371
goes with Essek, in the sense of

04:01:25.371 --> 04:01:26.981
they're not just going to give a copy

04:01:26.981 --> 04:01:31.270
of all their work to a central agent.

04:01:31.270 --> 04:01:33.951
SAM: When we get back we can take it.

04:01:33.951 --> 04:01:35.161
Yeah.

04:01:35.161 --> 04:01:37.851
TALIESIN: I feel comfortable knowing what I know.

04:01:37.851 --> 04:01:40.644
LAURA: Okay, I think we just go.

04:01:40.644 --> 04:01:43.041
SAM: Yeah.
TALIESIN: I think we just go.

04:01:43.041 --> 04:01:44.669
LIAM: So that we make a good impression with Yussa,

04:01:44.669 --> 04:01:46.528
would you like to send word?
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:01:46.528 --> 04:01:50.754
Definitely. I'll send a message to his assistant.

04:01:53.001 --> 04:01:54.464
SAM: Whose name is?

04:01:55.683 --> 04:01:56.673
MARISHA: He's a goblin.

04:01:56.673 --> 04:01:57.898
LAURA: Gentleman goblin.

04:01:57.898 --> 04:01:59.564
MARISHA: Gentleman goblin.

04:01:59.564 --> 04:02:01.411
Awesome pinstriped suit.

04:02:01.411 --> 04:02:03.521
His name is--

04:02:03.521 --> 04:02:04.938
SAM: I'm looking.

04:02:07.106 --> 04:02:08.974
MATT: Starts with a W.

04:02:08.974 --> 04:02:10.849
MARISHA: Winsworth.

04:02:10.849 --> 04:02:12.399
MATT: Close enough.
MARISHA: Werthers.

04:02:12.399 --> 04:02:14.294
MATT: (laughs)
MARISHA: Wellington?

04:02:14.294 --> 04:02:16.501
LIAM: Worthington.
MARISHA: Worthington!

04:02:16.501 --> 04:02:17.833
LAURA: No.
SAM: That's not right.

04:02:17.833 --> 04:02:19.441
ASHLEY: Whippersnapper? Whippy?

04:02:19.441 --> 04:02:20.824
LAURA: Wow.
MARISHA: Wimbleton.

04:02:20.824 --> 04:02:21.923
LAURA: Just a lot of dicks.

04:02:21.923 --> 04:02:23.448
There's just a lot of dicks.

04:02:23.448 --> 04:02:25.611
(laughter)

04:02:25.611 --> 04:02:27.341
LIAM: Wilbur.
MATT: Equal note taker,

04:02:27.341 --> 04:02:28.265
just of a different kind.

04:02:28.265 --> 04:02:29.971
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: Wensforth.

04:02:29.971 --> 04:02:31.220
MARISHA and LIAM: Wensworth!

04:02:31.220 --> 04:02:32.128
MATT: Forth.
LIAM: Wensforth.

04:02:32.128 --> 04:02:34.403
(laughter)
MARISHA: Wensforth!

04:02:34.403 --> 04:02:35.444
TRAVIS: Jesus.

04:02:37.740 --> 04:02:39.015
MATT: But yes, you can send a note to him.

04:02:39.015 --> 04:02:40.464
LAURA: I'm going to send a message.

04:02:41.313 --> 04:02:44.588
Wens... what'd he say?

04:02:44.588 --> 04:02:45.463
TRAVIS: Wensforth?

04:02:45.463 --> 04:02:49.651
LAURA: Wensforth! Long time no talk.

04:02:49.651 --> 04:02:51.401
We're coming by.

04:02:51.401 --> 04:02:53.864
Things are pretty dire.

04:02:55.211 --> 04:02:56.634
We'll be there soon.

04:03:01.731 --> 04:03:03.831
Gotta talk to Yussa.

04:03:05.121 --> 04:03:06.771
It's important.

04:03:06.771 --> 04:03:08.349
See ya.

04:03:08.349 --> 04:03:10.374
SAM: Nice.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

04:03:10.374 --> 04:03:11.690
SAM: Every word.
MATT: "Oh, good to know.

04:03:11.690 --> 04:03:13.744
"I'll let the master know right away."

04:03:14.806 --> 04:03:15.639
That's it.

04:03:15.639 --> 04:03:18.469
TALIESIN: Got to use the whole spell, can't waste.

04:03:18.469 --> 04:03:19.501
SAM: No, you can't waste.

04:03:19.501 --> 04:03:21.374
LIAM: Every part of the buffalo.
TALIESIN: Every part.

04:03:22.274 --> 04:03:27.274
MATT: If you want to, you catch up briefly with Dagen,

04:03:27.401 --> 04:03:29.991
who already is in the middle of telling tales

04:03:29.991 --> 04:03:32.901
and laughing with some of the Aurora Watch soldiers.

04:03:32.901 --> 04:03:33.791
They're sharing a drink

04:03:33.791 --> 04:03:35.011
in one of the smaller mess areas,

04:03:35.011 --> 04:03:36.651
as he turns over to the rest of you before you leave

04:03:36.651 --> 04:03:37.642
and just goes,

04:03:39.634 --> 04:03:43.293
"Well, what you all up to?

04:03:43.293 --> 04:03:44.568
"Anything in particular?"

04:03:46.281 --> 04:03:48.405
MARISHA: I think we'll cross paths again,

04:03:48.405 --> 04:03:50.446
but we've got to go.

04:03:51.644 --> 04:03:53.741
MATT: "All right, well. take care of yourselves."

04:03:53.741 --> 04:03:55.781
MARISHA: Think you're going to stick around here?

04:03:55.781 --> 04:03:57.631
MATT: "Oh, at least until the work dries up.

04:03:57.631 --> 04:04:00.281
"I don't feel like trekking all the way back to Balenpost.

04:04:00.281 --> 04:04:04.121
"or really enter the semblance of society

04:04:04.121 --> 04:04:06.631
"without any sort of means of making some cash.

04:04:06.631 --> 04:04:11.131
"And well, to be honest, I'm kind of okay

04:04:11.131 --> 04:04:15.228
"without running into giant ancient white dragons."

04:04:15.228 --> 04:04:16.061
TRAVIS: (laughs)

04:04:16.061 --> 04:04:17.361
TALIESIN: Oh.
MARISHA: Sorry about that.

04:04:17.361 --> 04:04:19.401
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: "Didn't bother me none.

04:04:19.401 --> 04:04:24.401
"You're just kind of a beacon of danger."

04:04:24.761 --> 04:04:27.851
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

04:04:27.851 --> 04:04:30.281
If you're still here in, like, a week,

04:04:30.281 --> 04:04:32.271
we could probably use you again.

04:04:32.271 --> 04:04:35.031
MATT: "Well, if I'm still around, come find me.

04:04:35.031 --> 04:04:36.819
"Will say, danger or not,

04:04:38.581 --> 04:04:40.931
"y'all been at least a fun batch to be following."

04:04:41.991 --> 04:04:45.896
MARISHA: Dagen, I have an interesting,
sort of personal question.

04:04:45.896 --> 04:04:49.586
MATT: "Well, I have probably a very disappointing,

04:04:49.586 --> 04:04:52.028
"slightly watered down answer."

04:04:53.721 --> 04:04:56.271
MARISHA: You've got to make some good coin doing all this.

04:04:58.341 --> 04:04:59.824
Where do you want to retire?

04:05:02.041 --> 04:05:03.864
You could be a pretty well-off man.

04:05:05.171 --> 04:05:07.981
Move to some small town on the beach somewhere,

04:05:07.981 --> 04:05:09.914
be comfortable the rest of your days.

04:05:11.241 --> 04:05:12.783
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

04:05:17.741 --> 04:05:19.641
MARISHA: Sparkly dice, sometimes hard to see.

04:05:20.971 --> 04:05:21.804
Persuasion?

04:05:21.804 --> 04:05:23.111
MATT: Yeah.
MARISHA: 15.

04:05:23.111 --> 04:05:25.252
MATT: 15? He goes,

04:05:29.594 --> 04:05:31.835
"Yeah. I got my eyes on a little place.

04:05:33.318 --> 04:05:35.260
"You ever been to Shamal Bay?"

04:05:36.551 --> 04:05:39.130
MARISHA: Is that in-- Do I know where that is?

04:05:39.130 --> 04:05:40.081
MATT: It's in Marquet.

04:05:40.081 --> 04:05:41.131
MARISHA: Is that in Marquet?

04:05:42.311 --> 04:05:44.348
MATT: "It's called the Bay of Gifts.

04:05:44.348 --> 04:05:49.071
"It's got some real good sunlight."

04:05:49.071 --> 04:05:51.721
MARISHA: I've heard of that place.

04:05:51.721 --> 04:05:55.794
MATT: "Well, it ain't cheap, but I got a plan."

04:05:57.011 --> 04:05:59.941
MARISHA: Good for you, man. Good for you.

04:05:59.941 --> 04:06:00.978
MATT: "How about you?"

04:06:03.041 --> 04:06:06.241
MARISHA: Oh, I might have some retirement property.

04:06:06.241 --> 04:06:08.980
There's actually a bar named after me.

04:06:08.980 --> 04:06:10.878
Are you familiar with Rumblecusp?

04:06:12.501 --> 04:06:13.334
MATT: "You don't got to shit me,

04:06:13.334 --> 04:06:15.820
"you're young, you got plenty of time to figure it out."

04:06:15.820 --> 04:06:18.070
(laughter)

04:06:18.921 --> 04:06:22.761
MARISHA: Okay, that's fair.

04:06:22.761 --> 04:06:25.481
Thanks, Dagen, for all your help.

04:06:25.481 --> 04:06:26.597
TRAVIS: Validation.

04:06:27.491 --> 04:06:28.901
LIAM: Thanks, Dad-gen.

04:06:28.901 --> 04:06:30.368
(laughter)

04:06:30.368 --> 04:06:31.433
TRAVIS: "You're funny."

04:06:31.433 --> 04:06:33.881
MARISHA: Yeah. "You're cute."

04:06:33.881 --> 04:06:35.621
MATT: "Stay safe, y'all.

04:06:35.621 --> 04:06:36.591
"See you round back."

04:06:36.591 --> 04:06:39.581
TALIESIN: Slip him really quickly
the last of the hot cocoa balls,

04:06:39.581 --> 04:06:43.214
give him a pat. It's good to make friends. Stay safe.

04:06:44.061 --> 04:06:46.321
LAURA: I give him a kiss on the cheek.

04:06:46.321 --> 04:06:47.487
MATT: "Oh."

04:06:47.487 --> 04:06:49.996
LAURA: You're worth every penny.

04:06:49.996 --> 04:06:52.705
MATT: "Get outta here."

04:06:52.705 --> 04:06:54.678
(laughter)

04:06:54.678 --> 04:06:56.859
Gives you a nod, and takes one of the cocoa balls.

04:06:58.329 --> 04:07:01.341
TALIESIN: It's gotta-- hot water.
MATT: (gagging)

04:07:01.341 --> 04:07:03.491
TALIESIN: I would actually, if you got--
or whiskey, anything.

04:07:03.491 --> 04:07:04.400
MATT: "Oh!"

04:07:04.400 --> 04:07:06.725
His teeth are just caked with powdered chocolate.

04:07:06.725 --> 04:07:07.748
(laughter)

04:07:07.748 --> 04:07:09.546
TALIESIN: Oh, this is bringing back some bad memories.

04:07:09.546 --> 04:07:11.341
(laughter)

04:07:11.341 --> 04:07:12.561
MATT: "I got it. It's all good."

04:07:12.561 --> 04:07:14.809
TALIESIN: It's going to foam, okay.
MATT: "Yeah (gurgling)."

04:07:14.809 --> 04:07:17.650
He's just drinking.
TALIESIN: That's the marshmallow, oh boy.

04:07:17.650 --> 04:07:19.554
MATT: (foaming) Oh no!

04:07:19.554 --> 04:07:22.287
(laughter)

04:07:22.287 --> 04:07:24.620
MARISHA: We just left him with another problem.

04:07:24.620 --> 04:07:28.294
TALIESIN: Oh, that's going to burn.
(laughter)

04:07:28.294 --> 04:07:29.977
MATT: You have your things gathered.

04:07:31.461 --> 04:07:32.411
To Nicodranas?

04:07:32.411 --> 04:07:35.381
LIAM: First, I will spend, while they're--

04:07:35.381 --> 04:07:36.981
I'll spend five or 10 minutes looking for

04:07:36.981 --> 04:07:38.741
just another stone from the ground.

04:07:38.741 --> 04:07:42.011
I don't know if it's all ice, or if there's anything else.

04:07:42.011 --> 04:07:43.361
MATT: It's easy enough to find the stone

04:07:43.361 --> 04:07:46.441
from any of the nearby structures built within, yep.

04:07:46.441 --> 04:07:47.661
LIAM: Okay, so I'll do the same thing.

04:07:47.661 --> 04:07:49.481
I'm going to wrap it in parchment

04:07:49.481 --> 04:07:51.971
and label it as this outpost,

04:07:51.971 --> 04:07:56.971
and then why don't we go back to our quarters,

04:07:57.231 --> 04:08:00.931
where I can draw on the ground in privacy?

04:08:00.931 --> 04:08:01.764
MATT: Easy enough.

04:08:01.764 --> 04:08:04.971
LIAM: I will draw the circle for Yussa's tower.

04:08:04.971 --> 04:08:05.951
MATT: Okay.

04:08:05.951 --> 04:08:09.071
As Caleb finishes, the familiar scribing on the ground,

04:08:09.071 --> 04:08:10.586
you see the faint glow begin to connect

04:08:10.586 --> 04:08:11.521
(whooshes)

04:08:11.521 --> 04:08:12.481
as it spirals outward,

04:08:12.481 --> 04:08:14.271
and then, all at once, (whooshes),

04:08:14.271 --> 04:08:19.121
flashes across as one connected web of arcane design.

04:08:19.121 --> 04:08:20.111
And you know what to do.

04:08:20.111 --> 04:08:21.661
One by one, (whizzing),

04:08:21.661 --> 04:08:23.311
you all jump into the circle,

04:08:23.311 --> 04:08:26.881
feeling yourself carried somewhere between space and time,

04:08:26.881 --> 04:08:29.811
and thrust towards your destination.

04:08:29.811 --> 04:08:32.531
We're going to go ahead and end tonight's episode there.

04:08:32.531 --> 04:08:34.625
You also do level up, because you've--

04:08:34.625 --> 04:08:36.302
(yelling)

04:08:36.302 --> 04:08:39.677
MATT: Because you've you've traversed across Eiselcross,

04:08:39.677 --> 04:08:41.311
survived an encounter with--

04:08:41.311 --> 04:08:42.144
MARISHA: A dragon?

04:08:42.144 --> 04:08:43.661
MATT: With the dragon,

04:08:43.661 --> 04:08:46.384
with the first real encounter with the Tomb Takers and--

04:08:46.384 --> 04:08:48.725
LIAM and ASHLEY: Dungeons &amp; Dwagons.

04:08:48.725 --> 04:08:50.571
MATT: Hit what I would consider a milestone in that regard.

04:08:50.571 --> 04:08:52.578
So you all level up.

04:08:52.578 --> 04:08:54.644
LAURA: Should we roll hit points now?
MATT: Let's go ahead and roll hit points now.

04:08:54.644 --> 04:08:56.381
LIAM: Whoa.

04:08:56.381 --> 04:09:00.449
I <i>might</i> pass a hundred hit points.

04:09:00.449 --> 04:09:01.665
Might.
TALIESIN: Don't dream.

04:09:01.665 --> 04:09:02.966
TRAVIS: Could be.
LIAM: Might not, though.

04:09:02.966 --> 04:09:05.321
TRAVIS: Could be.
(laughter)

04:09:05.321 --> 04:09:08.044
SAM: What happens now?

04:09:08.044 --> 04:09:09.061
MATT: I get to update everyone's--

04:09:09.061 --> 04:09:09.894
MARISHA: Monks are d8, right?

04:09:09.894 --> 04:09:10.880
LIAM: Just barely.

04:09:10.880 --> 04:09:14.638
LAURA: ♪ Level 14. ♪
LIAM: Just barely.

04:09:14.638 --> 04:09:15.888
TALIESIN: Eh! Okay.
MARISHA: Right?

04:09:16.795 --> 04:09:18.291
MATT: Level 14.
LIAM: Rolled a two.

04:09:18.291 --> 04:09:19.431
TRAVIS: I'll have to have figure out which one.

04:09:19.431 --> 04:09:22.821
TALIESIN: I rolled a two, but
that gets me, with my con modifier,

04:09:22.821 --> 04:09:25.310
just to 101 hit points.

04:09:25.310 --> 04:09:27.152
MATT: Yeah!
LIAM: Oh, happy day!

04:09:27.152 --> 04:09:29.371
ASHLEY: Yeah.
SAM: Sweet.

04:09:29.371 --> 04:09:31.391
LAURA: So when we roll it, we just add it to this roll,

04:09:31.391 --> 04:09:32.961
the HP number that's on here already?

04:09:32.961 --> 04:09:34.102
SAM: Yeah.
MATT: Correct, just the number you roll,

04:09:34.102 --> 04:09:35.954
it should add your constitution modifier automatically.

04:09:35.954 --> 04:09:38.151
MARISHA: Oh, ho ho ho! Oh!

04:09:38.151 --> 04:09:42.006
TALIESIN: What do we get at level 14?
What does a cleric get?

04:09:42.006 --> 04:09:44.163
It's just more spell slots, if I recall.

04:09:44.163 --> 04:09:45.437
LAURA: I think so? I don't know.

04:09:45.437 --> 04:09:47.262
TALIESIN: I'll look.
MARISHA: It's plus your con, right?

04:09:47.262 --> 04:09:48.511
Plus your con?
MATT: Well, it adds it automatically.

04:09:48.511 --> 04:09:49.419
You just put the die number in there.

04:09:49.419 --> 04:09:51.625
TALIESIN: I'll take a look.
LAURA: (gasps) I rolled six.

04:09:51.625 --> 04:09:54.402
MATT: Nice. So what's your total there?

04:09:54.402 --> 04:09:57.951
LAURA: 78 plus six is 84.

04:09:57.951 --> 04:10:00.224
Hold on, I will let you know.

04:10:04.481 --> 04:10:06.171
My total is 126 now.

04:10:06.171 --> 04:10:07.004
MATT: Gotcha.

04:10:07.004 --> 04:10:08.085
SAM: I just rolled an eight.

04:10:08.085 --> 04:10:12.235
MARISHA: So did I, yes!

04:10:15.574 --> 04:10:18.141
SAM: Ooh, man.
ASHLEY: Ooh!

04:10:18.141 --> 04:10:19.901
SAM and LAURA: What'd you get?

04:10:19.901 --> 04:10:21.342
ASHLEY: I rolled a 12.

04:10:21.342 --> 04:10:22.175
SAM: Whoa!

04:10:23.240 --> 04:10:24.351
MATT: What's that put you at, Yasha?

04:10:24.351 --> 04:10:25.844
ASHLEY: Okay, let's see, let's see, let's see.

04:10:25.844 --> 04:10:27.811
Yeah. Okay, let's add the--

04:10:29.249 --> 04:10:31.416
(humming)

04:10:35.357 --> 04:10:36.281
MATT: Let's just do your rolls,

04:10:36.281 --> 04:10:38.981
and let me know what your final HP total is.

04:10:38.981 --> 04:10:42.214
MARISHA: My HP is now at 117.

04:10:42.214 --> 04:10:43.739
MATT: 117, nice.

04:10:43.739 --> 04:10:44.731
MARISHA: I rolled an eight.

04:10:46.701 --> 04:10:48.792
ASHLEY: 154.
MATT: Some good rolls this level.

04:10:48.792 --> 04:10:51.092
SAM: 154?!

04:10:51.092 --> 04:10:51.925
MARISHA: Nice.

04:10:51.925 --> 04:10:52.991
TRAVIS: I'll have to let you know.

04:10:52.991 --> 04:10:56.361
I got to figure out which one I want to level up.

04:10:56.361 --> 04:10:57.361
MATT: Okay, you can do that.

04:10:57.361 --> 04:10:59.431
TRAVIS: Okay.
MATT: Up to you.

04:10:59.431 --> 04:11:01.151
SAM: I'm at 98.

04:11:01.151 --> 04:11:02.544
MATT: Look at you.

04:11:04.698 --> 04:11:05.531
LAURA: Wait a minute.

04:11:05.531 --> 04:11:07.081
I thought we got another spell.

04:11:09.461 --> 04:11:10.294
SAM: I'm looking.
MATT: You may not've.

04:11:10.294 --> 04:11:12.461
TRAVIS: I could do an eight and a 10,

04:11:12.461 --> 04:11:13.911
let you know which one it is.

04:11:13.911 --> 04:11:15.901
MATT: Yeah, sure, let's do that.

04:11:15.901 --> 04:11:16.734
TRAVIS: Reroll one.

04:11:16.734 --> 04:11:18.681
SAM: Ooh, I can learn a new spell.

04:11:18.681 --> 04:11:20.591
TRAVIS: It's either five or eight.

04:11:20.591 --> 04:11:21.561
MATT: Five for which one?

04:11:21.561 --> 04:11:24.251
TRAVIS: I would be five if I do a warlock,

04:11:24.251 --> 04:11:26.961
and eight if I do a paladin level.

04:11:26.961 --> 04:11:28.709
MATT: Gotcha, okay. I have that marked here.

04:11:28.709 --> 04:11:31.361
SAM: So many cool spells.

04:11:31.361 --> 04:11:33.077
I can learn Tiny Hut!

04:11:33.077 --> 04:11:34.298
MATT: Caduceus, what's yours?

04:11:34.298 --> 04:11:35.741
TALIESIN: 121.

04:11:35.741 --> 04:11:37.151
MATT: 121, all righty.

04:11:37.151 --> 04:11:39.159
LAURA: Oh, we get two--

04:11:39.159 --> 04:11:41.059
MATT: Okay, well,

04:11:41.059 --> 04:11:42.851
we'll go ahead and update that next time.

04:11:42.851 --> 04:11:45.262
MARISHA: Wait, is this-- is this, wait.

04:11:45.262 --> 04:11:46.928
LIAM: Wait.
TALIESIN: Wait.

04:11:46.928 --> 04:11:48.061
MATT: Well, we'll do it--

04:11:48.061 --> 04:11:49.531
We'll do it in a second.

04:11:49.531 --> 04:11:50.699
We'll let these nice folks go.

04:11:50.699 --> 04:11:51.532
LAURA: Oh gosh.

04:11:51.532 --> 04:11:54.782
SAM: No, they need to watch us
choose our spells and abilities.

04:11:54.782 --> 04:11:57.493
MATT: Sit here for the next 40 minutes, deciding on--

04:11:57.493 --> 04:11:58.409
LAURA: Wait a minute.

04:11:58.409 --> 04:12:01.243
SAM: What's better? Major Image, or Magic Circle?

04:12:01.243 --> 04:12:02.401
(laughter)

04:12:02.401 --> 04:12:03.541
TALIESIN: Major Image, moving on.

04:12:03.541 --> 04:12:05.373
MATT: I guess you'll find out.

04:12:05.373 --> 04:12:08.181
Anyway, thank you all so much for joining us.

04:12:08.181 --> 04:12:09.231
We love you very much.

04:12:09.231 --> 04:12:11.021
And is it Thursday yet?

04:12:11.021 --> 04:12:11.901
Good night.

04:12:11.901 --> 04:12:12.736
TRAVIS: Yeah!

MATT: Hello, everyone.

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.774
And welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role,

00:00:02.774 --> 00:00:04.688
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around

00:00:04.688 --> 00:00:05.903
and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:05.903 --> 00:00:08.484
ALL: (discordant yelling) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:08.484 --> 00:00:09.364
LIAM: It's good.

00:00:09.364 --> 00:00:10.672
MATT: Damn it, Liam. (laughs)

00:00:10.672 --> 00:00:12.846
(laughter)

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:14.080
Before we get started tonight,

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.314
we do have some announcements to get through,

00:00:15.314 --> 00:00:18.055
beginning with the first of our two sponsors tonight.

00:00:18.055 --> 00:00:19.232

00:00:19.232 --> 00:00:20.065
Sam.

00:00:20.065 --> 00:00:21.823
SAM: This episode is sponsored by Ravensburger

00:00:21.823 --> 00:00:25.520
and their brand new title "Pusheen Purrfect Pick"!

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.691
An adorable game about--
MATT and MARISHA: Pusheen!

00:00:28.691 --> 00:00:32.722
SAM: -- Planning a purrfect weekend
with Pusheen and her friends

00:00:32.722 --> 00:00:33.744
as a special--

00:00:33.744 --> 00:00:34.917
Am I saying it wrong?

00:00:34.917 --> 00:00:36.857
MARISHA: You're great. <i>Pu</i>sheen.
SAM: <i>Pu</i>sheen?

00:00:36.857 --> 00:00:38.100
MARISHA: Yeah!
SAM: Sorry.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.921
And as a special surprise treat even to him,

00:00:41.921 --> 00:00:44.179
Travis is going to read tonight's ad!

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:47.806
Travis, you'll find an envelope at your table with a copy.

00:00:47.806 --> 00:00:52.713
So rip that bad boy open and read about cats!

00:00:52.713 --> 00:00:53.894
TRAVIS: You fucking--

00:00:53.894 --> 00:00:56.631
(laughter)

00:00:56.631 --> 00:00:58.301
ASHLEY: His favorite!

00:00:58.301 --> 00:00:59.229
TRAVIS: There's no cat hair in it, right?

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:01.806
SAM: There's no cat hair in that envelope.

00:01:01.806 --> 00:01:03.954
(laughter)

00:01:03.954 --> 00:01:04.869
TRAVIS: Pusheen.

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:05.702
(laughter)

00:01:05.702 --> 00:01:08.236
SAM: Just the bolded parts.

00:01:08.236 --> 00:01:09.069
TRAVIS: Oh.

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:11.771
(laughter)

00:01:11.771 --> 00:01:15.317
From Ravensburger, a new game for us cat lovers!

00:01:15.317 --> 00:01:17.529
(laughter)

00:01:17.529 --> 00:01:19.660
Everyone's favorite tabby, Pusheen,

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.921
will crawl up your leg, bringing cat-errific moments

00:01:22.921 --> 00:01:25.047
for your whole feline family.

00:01:25.047 --> 00:01:25.905
(gags)

00:01:27.505 --> 00:01:28.549
SAM: There's more!
TRAVIS: There's more.

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:29.826
SAM: There's several paragraphs!

00:01:29.826 --> 00:01:32.885
TRAVIS: The double sided board game--

00:01:32.885 --> 00:01:33.718
I can feel it.

00:01:33.718 --> 00:01:36.131
Lets you play in the park or Pusheen's house.

00:01:36.131 --> 00:01:38.237
(stammering)

00:01:38.237 --> 00:01:39.374
How do you say the name?

00:01:39.374 --> 00:01:40.266
SAM: Pu<i>sheen</i>?

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:42.789
TRAVIS: Move Pusheen around the
board to gather items and friends

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:45.549
and turn them in for meow--

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:46.926
Meow-gical.

00:01:46.926 --> 00:01:48.507
Meow-gical?

00:01:48.507 --> 00:01:52.145
Meow-gical snapshots of weekend fun.

00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:53.425
Yes, this game makes me feel like

00:01:53.425 --> 00:01:56.078
I'm picking up a snuggly long-hair

00:01:56.078 --> 00:02:00.798
and rubbing my nose up and down his fuzzy belly?

00:02:00.798 --> 00:02:03.417
His thick dander filling my nostrils and heart

00:02:03.417 --> 00:02:04.679
with nine lives of love.

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:07.664
(laughter)

00:02:07.664 --> 00:02:10.021
SAM: Good start, Travis, but you're not done yet!

00:02:10.021 --> 00:02:11.851
There's some special surprises waiting for you

00:02:11.851 --> 00:02:13.816
in the box under your table!

00:02:13.816 --> 00:02:16.019
Go ahead and dump it out, Travis!
TRAVIS: No, there's not.

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:17.810
(laughter)

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.000
Is there?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.833
Goddamn it!

00:02:19.833 --> 00:02:22.083
(laughter)

00:02:23.061 --> 00:02:23.995
Is it this?

00:02:23.995 --> 00:02:24.828
SAM: Uh-huh!

00:02:24.828 --> 00:02:26.160
Let's see what we got for you!

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.660
LAURA: There better not be real cat hair in that.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.537
SAM: Maybe!
LAURA: You'll kill him.

00:02:29.537 --> 00:02:32.052
(laughter)

00:02:32.052 --> 00:02:34.933
SAM: Inside, you'll find fuzzy cat toys,

00:02:34.933 --> 00:02:36.628
and more great things!

00:02:36.628 --> 00:02:37.461
Hairballs!

00:02:38.313 --> 00:02:39.512
A bottle!

00:02:39.512 --> 00:02:41.359
TRAVIS: Does this say "anal gland secretion"?!

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:43.304
SAM: It does say "anal gland secretion"!

00:02:43.304 --> 00:02:48.063
And you'll also find a bottle of pure cat saliva in there.

00:02:48.063 --> 00:02:48.896
TRAVIS: Oh wow!

00:02:48.896 --> 00:02:51.292
Everything a kitty kisser like me

00:02:51.292 --> 00:02:54.450
could possibly want from whiskers to tail!

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.907
The game is for two to five players, ages eight and up.

00:02:57.907 --> 00:03:00.807
It includes this pleasantly squishy

00:03:00.807 --> 00:03:04.047
Pusheen game piece.

00:03:04.047 --> 00:03:05.594
Is this it?
SAM: I don't know!

00:03:05.594 --> 00:03:07.085
(laughter)
TRAVIS: Is this it?

00:03:07.085 --> 00:03:07.918
Is this it?

00:03:07.918 --> 00:03:10.918
Goddamn it! Is this it?

00:03:10.918 --> 00:03:12.056
SAM: I don't know!
TRAVIS: (yells)

00:03:12.056 --> 00:03:13.778
(laughter)

00:03:13.778 --> 00:03:15.525
SAM: But those are actual hairballs.

00:03:15.525 --> 00:03:16.358
LAURA: No!

00:03:19.551 --> 00:03:20.860
TRAVIS: These are not.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.856
LAURA: Don't really kill my husband.

00:03:22.856 --> 00:03:24.090
TRAVIS: Are there?

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.890
SAM: Pusheen-- I'll wrap it up for you.
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.209
SAM: Pusheen is--

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.193
Pusheen is available at Amazon, Barnes and Noble,

00:03:29.193 --> 00:03:30.852

00:03:30.852 --> 00:03:33.693

00:03:43.074 --> 00:03:44.908
MATT: Thank you, Sam. (laughs)

00:03:44.908 --> 00:03:46.514
And thank you, Ravensburger.

00:03:46.514 --> 00:03:48.210
You okay, Travis?
TRAVIS: Yeah!

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:49.043
LIAM: Boy.

00:03:49.043 --> 00:03:50.831
I wore the shirt on the right night.

00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:52.775
MATT: Yeah, apparently.
SAM: Yeah, you did.

00:03:52.775 --> 00:03:54.885
Cat-themed night.
ASHLEY: It's the best shirt.

00:03:54.885 --> 00:03:55.800
MATT: Yeah.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.339
All right, our second sponsor for the night

00:03:58.339 --> 00:04:00.267
are our friends at D&amp;D Beyond.

00:04:00.267 --> 00:04:01.437
Since the beginning of this campaign,

00:04:01.437 --> 00:04:03.152
they've been with us along for the ride.

00:04:03.152 --> 00:04:04.220
And thank you.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:05.238
Those who haven't had a chance yet,

00:04:05.238 --> 00:04:06.329
they are the official tool set

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.031
of Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th Edition.

00:04:09.031 --> 00:04:11.318
They make it way easier for you to DM your game,

00:04:11.318 --> 00:04:12.539
keep track of all your campaign stuff,

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:15.181
keep track of your characters, items, the whole deal.

00:04:21.195 --> 00:04:22.154
There we go.

00:04:23.061 --> 00:04:24.207
Few other announcements.

00:04:24.207 --> 00:04:26.196
Oh, first we wanted to thank you all for joining us

00:04:26.196 --> 00:04:27.543
here live with our Twitch chat,

00:04:27.543 --> 00:04:29.492
as well as on our YouTube live channel.

00:04:29.492 --> 00:04:33.812
However, our community moderated experience and chat

00:04:33.812 --> 00:04:35.884
is here at home on Twitch.

00:04:35.884 --> 00:04:40.092
So come and join us wherever your preference lies.

00:04:40.092 --> 00:04:41.231
SAM: Don't spill that, Travis.

00:04:41.231 --> 00:04:43.851
MATT: Also, we have another cool announcement.

00:04:43.851 --> 00:04:45.615
You get to discover the backstory

00:04:45.615 --> 00:04:50.275
of our very own gentle barbarian, Yasha,

00:04:50.275 --> 00:04:52.097
in the newly-announced

00:04:52.097 --> 00:04:55.212
Mighty Nein Origins--Yasha Nydoorin.

00:04:55.212 --> 00:04:56.214
(cheering)

00:04:56.214 --> 00:04:57.827
It's our next graphic novel by Dark Horse!

00:04:57.827 --> 00:05:00.537
SAM: She doesn't even know her origins!

00:05:00.537 --> 00:05:02.620
Is this a spoiler to you?

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:04.758
ASHLEY: Could be!

00:05:04.758 --> 00:05:07.008
(laughter)

00:05:08.053 --> 00:05:10.116
MATT: It's fun.
ASHLEY: I am very, very, very,

00:05:10.116 --> 00:05:11.926
very, very excited.

00:05:11.926 --> 00:05:12.761
MATT: Indeed.

00:05:12.761 --> 00:05:14.417
The graphic novel features writing

00:05:14.417 --> 00:05:16.556
by the amazing Cecil Castellucci,

00:05:16.556 --> 00:05:19.773
art by William Kirkby, and lettering by Ariana Maher,

00:05:19.773 --> 00:05:22.877
as well as the narrative that was created

00:05:22.877 --> 00:05:25.740
between myself and the wonderful Ashley Johnson.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:26.573
ASHLEY: Eyy!

00:05:28.735 --> 00:05:32.250
MATT: Expect Mighty Nein Origins--Yasha

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.036
to hit shelves in September.

00:05:34.036 --> 00:05:35.944
You can pre-order at local comic stores

00:05:35.944 --> 00:05:38.584
and bookstores right now.

00:05:38.584 --> 00:05:42.994
And tomorrow marks our six-year anniversary

00:05:42.994 --> 00:05:45.628
of doing this crazy shit online!

00:05:45.628 --> 00:05:47.624
MARISHA: That's right!
ASHLEY: God. Wow.

00:05:47.624 --> 00:05:48.680
MATT: We started streaming six years.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.759
MARISHA: Years!

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:51.037
MATT: Six years.

00:05:51.037 --> 00:05:52.835
You couldn't tell because we we've all aged 12

00:05:52.835 --> 00:05:55.997
in that time period, but it's been six.

00:05:55.997 --> 00:05:58.110
ASHLEY: No, none of us have aged except Marisha.

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:59.068
MATT: That's true.

00:05:59.068 --> 00:06:00.982
MARISHA: As people keep telling us.

00:06:00.982 --> 00:06:02.806
LIAM: We just let her catch up.

00:06:02.806 --> 00:06:04.373
(laughter)

00:06:04.373 --> 00:06:07.238
LAURA: It gets exponential in just a few years, Marisha.

00:06:07.238 --> 00:06:08.688
Get ready.
MARISHA: Give it six months.

00:06:08.688 --> 00:06:11.530
(laughter)

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.148
MATT: But it's been an absolutely incredible ride

00:06:14.148 --> 00:06:16.665
doing this weirdness with all of you.

00:06:16.665 --> 00:06:18.646
And onto six more.

00:06:18.646 --> 00:06:19.583
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

00:06:19.583 --> 00:06:20.416
(laughs)

00:06:20.416 --> 00:06:21.865
MARISHA: Let's make it a baker's dozen!

00:06:21.865 --> 00:06:23.168
MATT: Indeed.
ASHLEY: Yeah!

00:06:23.168 --> 00:06:26.461
MATT: Thank you all so much
for joining us for this craziness

00:06:26.461 --> 00:06:29.210
and all the wild things we have coming as well.

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.952
So six years in and it still feels like it's just beginning.

00:06:32.952 --> 00:06:34.585
Oh god.

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:38.791
Anyway, I think that's the end of our announcements.

00:06:38.791 --> 00:06:41.346
So tonight, let's go ahead and jump into

00:06:41.346 --> 00:06:44.487

(dragon roaring)

00:08:22.134 --> 00:08:24.383
MATT: And welcome back.
TRAVIS: There was no topping that first one.

00:08:24.383 --> 00:08:25.633
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Got to leave that.

00:08:25.633 --> 00:08:27.300
MATT: So last we left off:

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.651
The Mighty Nein, gathering some information

00:08:29.651 --> 00:08:31.719
and some final supplies and bits

00:08:31.719 --> 00:08:36.719
of preparation for their journey up north to Eiselcross.

00:08:37.358 --> 00:08:40.125
You reached out to Astrid in hopes of acquiring

00:08:40.125 --> 00:08:42.821
some of these cloaking amulets,

00:08:42.821 --> 00:08:44.627
one of which you've had for the entirety

00:08:44.627 --> 00:08:46.584
of your run in this campaign.

00:08:46.584 --> 00:08:48.735
Information was gathered and you were told

00:08:48.735 --> 00:08:50.591
they resided beneath one of the structures

00:08:50.591 --> 00:08:52.820
at the Vergesson Sanatorium,

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:57.820
where you went to break into it, separating into two troops.

00:08:58.696 --> 00:09:01.377
It went a little tits up.

00:09:01.377 --> 00:09:05.670
And with a brief encounter with Master Trent Ikithon

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:07.078
And with a brief encounter with Master Trent Ikithon

00:09:07.078 --> 00:09:10.172
realizing that it was you who broke in,

00:09:10.172 --> 00:09:11.821
a bit confused,

00:09:11.821 --> 00:09:16.659
you still managed to catch him off guard and escape,

00:09:16.659 --> 00:09:18.517
but not before he had acquired some information

00:09:18.517 --> 00:09:22.304
and some very curious interest in what it is you're doing

00:09:22.304 --> 00:09:26.304
and why you're being so dang secretive about it.

00:09:28.182 --> 00:09:32.780
You jaunt back to Nicodranas to visit your families,

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:36.767
caught up a bit and then begin to realize that

00:09:36.767 --> 00:09:39.576
you were indeed still being pursued.

00:09:39.576 --> 00:09:42.185
After Astrid and Eadwulf seem to have come

00:09:42.185 --> 00:09:43.534
at the behest of Trent,

00:09:43.534 --> 00:09:48.040
but warned you of his particular coming very soon.

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:52.025
You gathered the Ruby of the Sea, Marion,

00:09:52.025 --> 00:09:56.295
as well as your family, Veth, both Yeza and Luc,

00:09:56.295 --> 00:10:00.768
and immediately fled from the Lavish Chateau.

00:10:00.768 --> 00:10:02.147
Having it closed behind you,

00:10:02.147 --> 00:10:03.973
rushing to Tidepeak Tower

00:10:03.973 --> 00:10:06.527
where you learned that the mage, Yussa,

00:10:06.527 --> 00:10:08.793
is currently on his own expedition.

00:10:08.793 --> 00:10:12.357
Astrally projecting himself into the astral plane

00:10:12.357 --> 00:10:14.624
in search of information to help you in your endeavors,

00:10:14.624 --> 00:10:17.828
but as such, he is unreachable.

00:10:17.828 --> 00:10:21.810
As you begin to look about for some means of escape,

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:26.810
you notice that Trent has come to the tower

00:10:27.232 --> 00:10:29.163
and followed you here.

00:10:29.163 --> 00:10:32.171
In a rush, you hatched a plan,

00:10:32.171 --> 00:10:36.671
where some of you took the Folding Halls of Halas,

00:10:37.564 --> 00:10:39.797
the Happy Fun Ball as you call it,

00:10:39.797 --> 00:10:42.272
and decided to trek into that sphere

00:10:42.272 --> 00:10:45.598
with Caleb setting most of the puzzle to completion

00:10:45.598 --> 00:10:47.968
and then handing it to Fjord to finish,

00:10:47.968 --> 00:10:51.170
in which Fjord, Yasha, and Beauregard

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:52.872
stayed within the radius as it was triggered,

00:10:52.872 --> 00:10:55.885
and within a flash, they were gone,

00:10:55.885 --> 00:10:59.110
sealed within The Folding Halls.

00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:01.384
The rest of you took to a singular scroll

00:11:01.384 --> 00:11:05.371
that was gifted to Yussa at some point in the past.

00:11:05.371 --> 00:11:08.359
Reading it you realized it was a Plane Shift scroll,

00:11:08.359 --> 00:11:13.110
and contained with it one singular rod that was attuned.

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:15.427
To where? You're not certain.

00:11:15.427 --> 00:11:18.318
It was warm to the touch.

00:11:18.318 --> 00:11:21.276
As the door opened and you began to
read the spell to escape,

00:11:21.276 --> 00:11:25.316
the first person to reach you was Astrid, who

00:11:26.899 --> 00:11:30.566
did not interfere with the completion of your spell.

00:11:30.566 --> 00:11:35.566
At which point you, the rest of you, with families in tow,

00:11:35.845 --> 00:11:38.710
vanished to where this may carry you.

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:43.664
So let's begin with Team Happy Fun Ball, shall we?

00:11:43.664 --> 00:11:45.322
TRAVIS: But I want to know where they're going!

00:11:45.322 --> 00:11:46.155
MARISHA: Me, too!
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:11:46.155 --> 00:11:47.519
MATT: We'll find out.
LIAM: Boy, we're in a pickle.

00:11:47.519 --> 00:11:48.908
(laughter)

00:11:48.908 --> 00:11:50.458
MARISHA: We're in a bit of a pickle.
ASHLEY: Boy, oh boy!

00:11:50.458 --> 00:11:52.336
TRAVIS: Inside of an astral dreadnought.

00:11:52.336 --> 00:11:54.981
MARISHA: Team Happy Fun Ball has a fun ring to it though.

00:11:54.981 --> 00:11:56.037
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:11:56.037 --> 00:12:00.869
MATT: So the three of you, Fjord, Beau, Yasha.

00:12:00.869 --> 00:12:02.293
There's a brief moment where you feel

00:12:02.293 --> 00:12:03.850
like time itself stretches,

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:06.207
your body has suddenly become this immaterial,

00:12:06.207 --> 00:12:07.182
being funneled through

00:12:07.182 --> 00:12:09.691
what feels like a tiny hole.

00:12:09.691 --> 00:12:12.388
It's not painful, just an odd stretch

00:12:12.388 --> 00:12:15.007
and then return.

00:12:15.007 --> 00:12:15.840
It's been a while since you've

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:16.999
felt that in particular.
LAURA: ♪ It's been a while ♪

00:12:16.999 --> 00:12:18.911
MATT: As soon as I said it, I knew it was coming.

00:12:18.911 --> 00:12:21.370
Gotta strike that phrase from my vernacular.

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:22.453
LIAM: That's kind of impossible.

00:12:22.453 --> 00:12:23.870
MATT: I know, I know.

00:12:25.535 --> 00:12:28.055
And as you take a moment to assess your surroundings,

00:12:28.055 --> 00:12:30.925
you're all standing in the middle of a

00:12:30.925 --> 00:12:35.030
circular stone chamber, about 30 feet in diameter,

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:38.613
about 15 feet high to the recessed ceiling.

00:12:41.187 --> 00:12:42.181
Looking around and you can see

00:12:42.181 --> 00:12:44.263
there are four colored tapestries

00:12:44.263 --> 00:12:46.781
hanging at different parts of the chamber.

00:12:46.781 --> 00:12:48.732
This is a familiar room.

00:12:48.732 --> 00:12:53.563
This is where you had first entered the Happy Fun Ball.

00:12:53.563 --> 00:12:57.278
Although you did not trek into this chamber,

00:12:57.278 --> 00:12:58.111
I don't believe.

00:12:58.111 --> 00:12:59.273
ASHLEY: I don't think I did.

00:12:59.273 --> 00:13:00.936
MATT: So this is all fresh to you.

00:13:00.936 --> 00:13:04.715
But nevertheless, there is a blue tapestry,

00:13:04.715 --> 00:13:06.706
there is a black tapestry, a green tapestry,

00:13:06.706 --> 00:13:08.781
and a red tapestry.

00:13:08.781 --> 00:13:11.359
And they are all beautifully filigreed

00:13:11.359 --> 00:13:15.109
and embroidered with gold thread and designs.

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:18.970
What would you like to do?

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:20.002
MARISHA: Okay.

00:13:20.002 --> 00:13:23.733
We know that we got to go to the dragon chamber, right?

00:13:23.733 --> 00:13:24.566
From here?

00:13:24.566 --> 00:13:26.127
TRAVIS: No, not yet.

00:13:26.127 --> 00:13:27.042
We go to the study.

00:13:27.042 --> 00:13:28.286
MARISHA: From here to the study.

00:13:28.286 --> 00:13:30.320
From the study to the dragon chamber.

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.271
TRAVIS: So you know, (laughs)

00:13:32.271 --> 00:13:34.021
this place is fucked.

00:13:35.499 --> 00:13:40.101
ASHLEY: I feel like I was in here for the dreadnought.

00:13:40.101 --> 00:13:40.934
TRAVIS: Yes!

00:13:40.934 --> 00:13:43.692
MATT: You've been in here, but this particular room

00:13:43.692 --> 00:13:45.125
you have not.
ASHLEY: This area, yeah.

00:13:45.125 --> 00:13:46.132
TRAVIS: Do you remember that--

00:13:46.132 --> 00:13:47.476
ASHLEY: I remember it was very weird.

00:13:47.476 --> 00:13:51.671
TRAVIS: It's made to attack magic users.

00:13:51.671 --> 00:13:53.696
ASHLEY: Well--
TRAVIS: I mean, everything,

00:13:53.696 --> 00:13:56.271
but specifically wizards.

00:13:56.271 --> 00:14:00.402
ASHLEY: Okay. So it's a good thing we're all here then.

00:14:00.402 --> 00:14:01.935
TRAVIS: You need some magic to get through, though,

00:14:01.935 --> 00:14:03.490
which is why I came.

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:06.734
If I remember, but first, is there anything about this room

00:14:06.734 --> 00:14:07.964
from the last time that we were in here

00:14:07.964 --> 00:14:09.723
that seems different?

00:14:09.723 --> 00:14:11.164
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:14:11.164 --> 00:14:12.997
LIAM: I love this so much.

00:14:15.116 --> 00:14:16.924
TRAVIS: 14-- 17.

00:14:16.924 --> 00:14:17.757
MATT: 17.

00:14:18.951 --> 00:14:20.047
No, it looks--

00:14:20.047 --> 00:14:22.407
Well, no, what you do notice is when you first arrived here

00:14:22.407 --> 00:14:25.415
there were two bodies on the ground.

00:14:25.415 --> 00:14:28.996
Two other individuals that had passed away

00:14:28.996 --> 00:14:31.597
by some means you couldn't quite pinpoint,

00:14:31.597 --> 00:14:34.007
but the corpses are gone.

00:14:34.007 --> 00:14:35.454
TRAVIS: Yussa's been through here.

00:14:35.454 --> 00:14:38.300
He said he came back in, did some more studying.

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:40.204
He said he updated his map, but we don't have that.

00:14:40.204 --> 00:14:41.460
We have the old one.

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:43.976
We went through the red--

00:14:43.976 --> 00:14:45.658
MARISHA: The red one goes to the study, right?

00:14:45.658 --> 00:14:48.411
TRAVIS: Yes, but if I remember correctly,

00:14:48.411 --> 00:14:52.386
we had to pick a lock on the other side of it.

00:14:52.386 --> 00:14:53.219
MARISHA: Okay.

00:14:53.219 --> 00:14:55.242
There should be a door behind it, right?

00:14:55.242 --> 00:14:56.075
TRAVIS: There should be.

00:14:56.075 --> 00:14:58.817
And then everything lit on fire, which should be fun,

00:14:58.817 --> 00:15:01.067
because that's so our forte.

00:15:02.679 --> 00:15:03.979
MARISHA: Where's Caleb when you need him?

00:15:03.979 --> 00:15:04.812
TRAVIS: Not here.

00:15:04.812 --> 00:15:06.493
MARISHA: Okay.
ASHLEY: We can do this, we can do this.

00:15:06.493 --> 00:15:07.535
TRAVIS: We got this! No problem.

00:15:07.535 --> 00:15:09.037
ASHLEY: We just think like Caleb

00:15:09.037 --> 00:15:10.764
and we can do it.

00:15:10.764 --> 00:15:11.725
TRAVIS: Fire, fire, fire.

00:15:11.725 --> 00:15:13.528
MARISHA: And just-- oh, go ahead.

00:15:13.528 --> 00:15:15.556
ASHLEY: Is there anything on the tapestries?

00:15:15.556 --> 00:15:17.787
Like designs and things?

00:15:17.787 --> 00:15:19.657
MATT: Elaborate embroidery

00:15:19.657 --> 00:15:24.368
that just seems to be a sequence of unique designs.

00:15:24.368 --> 00:15:27.297
No specific imagery or iconography,

00:15:27.297 --> 00:15:32.297
just beautiful shapes, symmetrical.

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:33.663
Nothing you recognize.

00:15:35.699 --> 00:15:36.919
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:15:36.919 --> 00:15:38.928
TRAVIS: Let's look behind the red one.

00:15:40.502 --> 00:15:41.835
Beginner's luck.

00:15:44.171 --> 00:15:45.289
MATT: I need you-- No, I'm kidding.

00:15:45.289 --> 00:15:46.751
(laughter)

00:15:46.751 --> 00:15:48.075
ASHLEY: You die instantly.

00:15:48.075 --> 00:15:51.992
MATT: As you peek behind ever so carefully, eyes peeled,

00:15:51.992 --> 00:15:54.891
intense, ready to leap at whatever may come at you--

00:15:54.891 --> 00:15:56.974
like that, ready to jump.

00:15:57.972 --> 00:15:59.196
TRAVIS: Did you go all the way down? (laughs)

00:15:59.196 --> 00:16:00.795
(laughter)

00:16:00.795 --> 00:16:01.914
TRAVIS: ♪ Drop it like it's hot ♪

00:16:01.914 --> 00:16:03.093
♪ Drop it like it's hot ♪

00:16:03.093 --> 00:16:05.646
MATT: There is indeed a doorway.

00:16:05.646 --> 00:16:07.063
But it is closed.

00:16:08.286 --> 00:16:10.113
ASHLEY: Okay. There's a door.

00:16:10.113 --> 00:16:10.965
I'll try the door.

00:16:10.965 --> 00:16:12.751
MARISHA: Does it look locked?

00:16:12.751 --> 00:16:13.847
(stammering)

00:16:13.847 --> 00:16:15.118
MATT: As you ask this question and she reaches

00:16:15.118 --> 00:16:16.874
and grabs towards the handle and--

00:16:16.874 --> 00:16:19.508
ASHLEY: Probably should have checked it for traps.

00:16:19.508 --> 00:16:20.518
TRAVIS: Can you check it for traps?

00:16:20.518 --> 00:16:23.028
ASHLEY: Nope!
TRAVIS: Me neither. You?

00:16:23.028 --> 00:16:24.678
MARISHA: I mean, I can look at it and

00:16:24.678 --> 00:16:27.111
try and deduce what I know.

00:16:27.111 --> 00:16:29.040
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's show that
we've learned from our friends.

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:30.089
Let's check it for traps.

00:16:30.089 --> 00:16:31.219
ASHLEY: I'm going to check it for traps.

00:16:31.219 --> 00:16:33.096
MARISHA: Okay. I'll--

00:16:33.096 --> 00:16:34.596
TRAVIS: Assist?
MARISHA: Assist!

00:16:35.527 --> 00:16:36.876
TRAVIS: I will be the foreman.

00:16:36.876 --> 00:16:38.253
MATT: All right, it's an investigation check.

00:16:38.253 --> 00:16:40.501
Go ahead and look over to see if you recognize any traps.

00:16:40.501 --> 00:16:43.482
MARISHA: Fucking middle management.

00:16:43.482 --> 00:16:47.976
ASHLEY: Ooh, that's a natural 19 plus investigation.

00:16:47.976 --> 00:16:49.122
25.

00:16:49.122 --> 00:16:50.668
LAURA: Six? You have a six for investigation?

00:16:50.668 --> 00:16:51.766
ASHLEY: I have a six.

00:16:51.766 --> 00:16:54.472
Guys, we've been sleeping on my snooping.

00:16:54.472 --> 00:16:56.478
(laughter)

00:16:56.478 --> 00:16:57.395
MATT: All righty.

00:16:58.722 --> 00:17:01.198
While it is indeed locked as you get close

00:17:01.198 --> 00:17:03.895
and inspect it and that little

00:17:03.895 --> 00:17:06.711
slight grapple you put onto

00:17:06.711 --> 00:17:10.855
this odd looped knob pulley device,

00:17:10.855 --> 00:17:12.203
as you get close

00:17:12.203 --> 00:17:16.369
you can just faintly make out

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:17.846
in the wood around it,

00:17:17.846 --> 00:17:21.356
and even the stone setting to the right of it,

00:17:21.356 --> 00:17:25.851
these ever so smooth parts of the stone

00:17:25.851 --> 00:17:28.410
where it looks like whatever sort of dust

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:33.296
may just be faintly gathering in areas does not settle.

00:17:33.296 --> 00:17:35.243
And it is patterned, which leads you to believe

00:17:35.243 --> 00:17:37.967
that there's something magical

00:17:37.967 --> 00:17:40.834
about this lock.

00:17:42.464 --> 00:17:45.831
MARISHA: Last time, Twiggy picked this lock.

00:17:45.831 --> 00:17:46.729
TRAVIS: Yup.

00:17:46.729 --> 00:17:49.408
MARISHA: I think, and it filled the chamber with fire.

00:17:49.408 --> 00:17:50.700
TRAVIS: Yup.
ASHLEY: Oh.

00:17:53.263 --> 00:17:56.050
MARISHA: Do we have anything to potentially disarm this?

00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:58.855
I have thieves tools, believe it or not.

00:17:58.855 --> 00:18:01.018
TRAVIS: She has Dispel Magic.

00:18:01.018 --> 00:18:03.564
ASHLEY: I don't.
SAM: Does she?

00:18:03.564 --> 00:18:04.397
MARISHA: You traded out

00:18:04.397 --> 00:18:06.905
Magician's Judge!
ASHLEY: Kima took Magician's Judge

00:18:06.905 --> 00:18:07.795
instead of Skingorger.

00:18:07.795 --> 00:18:10.247
TRAVIS: Fucking nipples on a horse.

00:18:10.247 --> 00:18:11.913
That is unfortunate.

00:18:11.913 --> 00:18:15.198
ASHLEY: Oh, I realized it after the transaction

00:18:15.198 --> 00:18:18.301
that I probably should have just not given her an option

00:18:18.301 --> 00:18:20.822
and should have just given her Skingorger.

00:18:20.822 --> 00:18:23.175
Trust me, I've been thinking about it.

00:18:23.175 --> 00:18:24.175
TRAVIS: Cool, cool, cool.

00:18:24.175 --> 00:18:25.311
We're fine.

00:18:25.311 --> 00:18:27.522
I have cold stuff in case it gets real hot.

00:18:27.522 --> 00:18:29.106
Might work. Might not.

00:18:29.106 --> 00:18:30.977
MARISHA: Oh yeah, do you still have that ring?

00:18:30.977 --> 00:18:31.810
Well, it doesn't matter.

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:32.986
TRAVIS: No! Jester has it!

00:18:32.986 --> 00:18:34.016
MARISHA: Shit!
ASHLEY: Oh no!

00:18:34.016 --> 00:18:35.853
(laughter)
TRAVIS: Fuck!

00:18:35.853 --> 00:18:38.211
The one time!

00:18:38.211 --> 00:18:40.497
LIAM: We were just whispering about it!

00:18:40.497 --> 00:18:41.330
(laughter)

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:42.226
TRAVIS: You!

00:18:42.226 --> 00:18:44.483
(laughter)

00:18:44.483 --> 00:18:45.434
TRAVIS: That's all right, we're about to put

00:18:45.434 --> 00:18:46.860
two new bodies in this bitch.

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:48.850
(laughter)

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:51.293
TRAVIS: (clears throat)

00:18:51.293 --> 00:18:52.549
MARISHA: All right.

00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:53.482
TRAVIS: Come on, thieves tools.

00:18:53.482 --> 00:18:54.593
MARISHA: We should just do this, right?

00:18:54.593 --> 00:18:55.927
And just be prepared?

00:18:55.927 --> 00:18:57.378
TRAVIS: I'll turn my back to the door.

00:18:57.378 --> 00:18:59.909
LAURA: It's been five hours outside already.

00:18:59.909 --> 00:19:01.628
MARISHA: I know, right?

00:19:01.628 --> 00:19:02.461
Okay.

00:19:03.926 --> 00:19:06.695
I put on my goggles just as safety.

00:19:06.695 --> 00:19:07.862
ASHLEY: Inspiration.

00:19:09.602 --> 00:19:10.965
I can't do Inspiration.
MATT: No.

00:19:10.965 --> 00:19:11.798
MARISHA: Oh.

00:19:11.798 --> 00:19:13.414
I thought it was a fancy Barbarian thing.

00:19:13.414 --> 00:19:15.693
MATT: You can be inspirational if you'd like.

00:19:15.693 --> 00:19:17.632
ASHLEY: You're amazing.

00:19:17.632 --> 00:19:19.134
You're so good at this.

00:19:19.134 --> 00:19:20.357
MARISHA: Keep talking.

00:19:20.357 --> 00:19:22.328
ASHLEY: I can't wait to see you open the door.

00:19:22.328 --> 00:19:23.161
MARISHA: Keep going.

00:19:23.161 --> 00:19:23.994
MATT: No mechanical benefit,

00:19:23.994 --> 00:19:25.323
but go ahead and make your roll.

00:19:25.323 --> 00:19:26.281
MARISHA: Just straight?

00:19:26.281 --> 00:19:28.660
MATT: Now, are you proficient in thieves tools?

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:29.810
MARISHA: No.

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:31.602
MATT: Then it's just the dexterity modifier bonus.

00:19:31.602 --> 00:19:32.909
So go ahead and roll a d20.

00:19:32.909 --> 00:19:34.659
TRAVIS: Better you than me.

00:19:35.568 --> 00:19:37.846
MARISHA: 19 total. Rolled a 14.

00:19:37.846 --> 00:19:40.177
MATT: 19 total?
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:19:40.177 --> 00:19:41.700
MATT: As you get down carefully

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:44.842
with Yasha's words cheering you on,

00:19:44.842 --> 00:19:46.659
Fjord watching at a distance,

00:19:46.659 --> 00:19:48.659
you place the tools in.

00:19:49.962 --> 00:19:50.795
(clicks)

00:19:52.517 --> 00:19:55.067
It's not going. The tumblers aren't going.

00:19:57.185 --> 00:19:58.807
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:19:58.807 --> 00:20:01.895
What are the little bits on the side again that we saw?

00:20:01.895 --> 00:20:04.211
MATT: You just see this very, very faint,

00:20:04.211 --> 00:20:05.157
difficult to see pattern

00:20:05.157 --> 00:20:07.101
in both the wood and the stone to the side of it

00:20:07.101 --> 00:20:08.101
that almost forms a circle

00:20:08.101 --> 00:20:11.539
around where the door clicks into place.

00:20:11.539 --> 00:20:13.653
ASHLEY: What if it's a little code?

00:20:13.653 --> 00:20:15.439
TRAVIS: Can you move it?

00:20:15.439 --> 00:20:16.693
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:20:16.693 --> 00:20:18.523
Yeah. Let me try moving.

00:20:18.523 --> 00:20:21.329
Does it look like I can press in on anything?

00:20:21.329 --> 00:20:23.155
MATT: It's just a very, very faint difference in texture

00:20:23.155 --> 00:20:24.863
from the rest of the surrounding material,

00:20:24.863 --> 00:20:27.625
which leads you to believe that it's either

00:20:27.625 --> 00:20:31.378
resistant to dust or just seems to be

00:20:31.378 --> 00:20:34.545
of a slightly different mock material.

00:20:39.146 --> 00:20:41.942
ASHLEY: Maybe I'll try to twist it or something.

00:20:41.942 --> 00:20:42.775
MATT: Okay.

00:20:42.775 --> 00:20:46.804
As you titty twist the portion of the wall there,

00:20:46.804 --> 00:20:49.313
it doesn't quite react.

00:20:49.313 --> 00:20:51.365
ASHLEY: It's not the way to do it.

00:20:51.365 --> 00:20:52.198
Okay.

00:20:54.225 --> 00:20:55.955
Guys, what if we're just stuck in here forever?

00:20:55.955 --> 00:20:58.918
TRAVIS: You want to try and pick the lock again?

00:20:58.918 --> 00:21:03.918
I have a piton or some climbing material and some daggers?

00:21:04.188 --> 00:21:06.465
MARISHA: I can try.

00:21:06.465 --> 00:21:09.357
I feel right on the cusp of if I push any further,

00:21:09.357 --> 00:21:11.899
this thing is going to snap inside the lock or something.

00:21:11.899 --> 00:21:12.777
I don't know.

00:21:12.777 --> 00:21:14.093
TRAVIS: Okay, do you want to use my

00:21:14.093 --> 00:21:16.459
climbing materials? (laughs)

00:21:18.019 --> 00:21:19.320
MARISHA: Let me see what I can do.

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.418
Can I try again?

00:21:20.418 --> 00:21:24.064
DC's going to be harder and the 19 didn't make it.

00:21:24.064 --> 00:21:25.624
MATT: If you want to take a little bit of time here,

00:21:25.624 --> 00:21:27.374
you can try it again.

00:21:29.735 --> 00:21:30.568
MARISHA: All right.

00:21:30.568 --> 00:21:31.501
TRAVIS: Oh boy.

00:21:32.572 --> 00:21:34.644
MARISHA: I'm going to fuck this up.

00:21:34.644 --> 00:21:35.477
I'm going to do great.

00:21:35.477 --> 00:21:37.216
TRAVIS: My dex mod is zero, so.

00:21:37.216 --> 00:21:38.843
LIAM: I sent you here on purpose.

00:21:38.843 --> 00:21:41.505
MATT: (laughs)

00:21:41.505 --> 00:21:44.588
Caleb's plan is coming to fruition.

00:21:45.629 --> 00:21:47.662
MARISHA: It's worse.

00:21:47.662 --> 00:21:48.495
17.

00:21:53.723 --> 00:21:57.223
MATT: This time as you push to the same point,

00:21:58.217 --> 00:22:01.749
either it's rusted or there's something about this tumbler,

00:22:01.749 --> 00:22:04.452
the fourth click in that's just not going.

00:22:04.452 --> 00:22:07.893
And as you get frustrated and push past it,

00:22:07.893 --> 00:22:10.121
you watch as those little symbols--

00:22:10.121 --> 00:22:10.954
MARISHA: Uh-oh.

00:22:12.225 --> 00:22:14.700
MATT: And in a flash of white--
MARISHA: I just try and quickly say:

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:15.949
Get down!
MATT: I need all of you

00:22:15.949 --> 00:22:17.299
to make a dexterity saving throw.

00:22:17.299 --> 00:22:18.132
TRAVIS: Cool.

00:22:22.046 --> 00:22:23.400
17.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.169
SAM: Wait, Caduceus didn't go with them?

00:22:25.169 --> 00:22:26.213
LIAM: No.
MARISHA: Mm-mm.

00:22:26.213 --> 00:22:28.045
TRAVIS: No, you took both healers, you selfish fuck.

00:22:28.045 --> 00:22:29.420
SAM: Why?
MARISHA: 18.

00:22:30.514 --> 00:22:31.802
ASHLEY: 22.

00:22:31.802 --> 00:22:33.232
MATT: Great. All successes.

00:22:33.232 --> 00:22:34.899
That's good for you.

00:22:37.432 --> 00:22:38.322
MARISHA: Evasion.

00:22:38.322 --> 00:22:40.081
LIAM: So zero for you, right, Beau?

00:22:40.081 --> 00:22:40.914
MATT: Indeed.

00:22:43.599 --> 00:22:47.074
25 points of fire damage reduced to half

00:22:47.074 --> 00:22:49.104
for those of you who succeeded, and then none for you.

00:22:49.104 --> 00:22:50.527
TRAVIS: So 13 or 12?

00:22:50.527 --> 00:22:52.194
MATT: That'd be 12.
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:22:52.194 --> 00:22:55.174
MATT: As the room fills with burning fire

00:22:55.174 --> 00:22:56.959
and as you all recoil from it

00:22:56.959 --> 00:22:59.832
and it finally fades away for a second,

00:22:59.832 --> 00:23:03.831
you all are just dwelling in the pain and the flash heat

00:23:03.831 --> 00:23:07.053
and the searing light that your eyes have to refocus from,

00:23:07.053 --> 00:23:09.053
you look around and all the tapestries

00:23:09.053 --> 00:23:13.120
flapped to a calm state, unscathed by the flames.

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.731
The chamber as it was.

00:23:15.731 --> 00:23:16.839
TRAVIS: So take a break for a minute

00:23:16.839 --> 00:23:19.322
and let a week pass outside.

00:23:20.317 --> 00:23:22.652
One of these other tapestries goes to a dining hall,

00:23:22.652 --> 00:23:24.406
and then absolutely the direction

00:23:24.406 --> 00:23:25.575
we don't want to go on the map,

00:23:25.575 --> 00:23:27.064
and then there are two other tapestries

00:23:27.064 --> 00:23:29.164
that are completely uncharted.

00:23:29.164 --> 00:23:30.870
No idea where those go!

00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:33.694
So we can always roll the fucking dice and just die.

00:23:33.694 --> 00:23:36.180
ASHLEY: Well, now that the--

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:37.293
No, no, no. That doesn't make any sense.

00:23:37.293 --> 00:23:39.322
I was going to say now that the magic went poof,

00:23:39.322 --> 00:23:41.351
but that's just what it does if you've tinkered with it.

00:23:41.351 --> 00:23:42.554
TRAVIS: Yup.
ASHLEY: It's not like it's gone.

00:23:42.554 --> 00:23:43.387
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:23:44.904 --> 00:23:46.811
MARISHA: The green tapestry we tried the first time

00:23:46.811 --> 00:23:49.052
we were in here, and it has poison fog behind it.

00:23:49.052 --> 00:23:50.567
TRAVIS: Cool. Cool.

00:23:50.567 --> 00:23:52.362
ASHLEY: You're immune to poison, right?

00:23:52.362 --> 00:23:54.976
MARISHA: I am--

00:23:54.976 --> 00:23:56.354
ASHLEY: It doesn't help us, but.
MATT: Are you trained in arcana?

00:23:56.354 --> 00:23:57.425
MARISHA: Resistant.

00:23:57.425 --> 00:23:58.631
No, I am immune to poison.

00:23:58.631 --> 00:23:59.590
I am immune to poison.

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:00.548
MATT: Beauregard.
MARISHA: Yeah?

00:24:00.548 --> 00:24:01.963
MATT: Are you trained in arcana?

00:24:01.963 --> 00:24:03.055
MARISHA: I'm not trained, no.

00:24:03.055 --> 00:24:06.274
LIAM: Always kills it though, with arcana.

00:24:06.274 --> 00:24:08.581
MARISHA: Because I'm smartses.

00:24:08.581 --> 00:24:10.058
Can I still roll for it?

00:24:10.058 --> 00:24:12.891
MATT: Go ahead and roll arcana for me.

00:24:14.414 --> 00:24:15.247
MARISHA: 14.

00:24:15.247 --> 00:24:16.496
Nope. 15.

00:24:16.496 --> 00:24:17.913
MATT: 15.
LIAM: Plus four.

00:24:19.777 --> 00:24:21.402
MATT: You don't understand enough about the nature

00:24:21.402 --> 00:24:25.110
of certain magic entrapments or

00:24:26.685 --> 00:24:29.176
glyphs, such as the one you just encountered.

00:24:29.176 --> 00:24:30.563
There's something that's just outside

00:24:30.563 --> 00:24:33.230
of your peripheral that you can't quite understand.

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:34.063
ASHLEY: I'm going to give it a look-see

00:24:34.063 --> 00:24:37.940
and see if maybe I can tell.

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:39.522
MARISHA: "Go into the ball," he said.

00:24:39.522 --> 00:24:41.663
"I need you in there," he said.

00:24:41.663 --> 00:24:45.425
"Your knowledge of the arcane," he said.

00:24:45.425 --> 00:24:46.968
ASHLEY: It's all magical, I think.

00:24:46.968 --> 00:24:48.578
Everything in here.

00:24:48.578 --> 00:24:50.522
MATT: All right. This does take time for both of you

00:24:50.522 --> 00:24:52.454
to sit here and concentrate in this space

00:24:52.454 --> 00:24:54.537
and try and pore over it.

00:24:55.457 --> 00:24:56.290
ASHLEY: Fuck.

00:24:57.667 --> 00:24:59.502
MATT: What's the plan?

00:24:59.502 --> 00:25:01.082
TRAVIS: Who said there's a fucking plan!

00:25:01.082 --> 00:25:02.980
(laughter)
ASHLEY: Okay. Okay.

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:04.214
TRAVIS: What plan?!
MARISHA: It felt like this lock

00:25:04.214 --> 00:25:05.983
was a little rusted on the inside.

00:25:05.983 --> 00:25:07.520
I do have a little bit of oil.

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:11.500
Maybe I can try and oil down my tools and try it again?

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:13.438
I don't know if that is a real fucking thing.

00:25:13.438 --> 00:25:16.156
TRAVIS: We were hitting things
later on this journey with cold,

00:25:16.156 --> 00:25:18.769
so I could try and cold the door a little bit.

00:25:18.769 --> 00:25:20.411
MARISHA: That feels like it would make it worse.

00:25:20.411 --> 00:25:21.328
ASHLEY: I have--

00:25:22.426 --> 00:25:24.481
That's not going to help, actually.

00:25:24.481 --> 00:25:25.905
LIAM: Fucking doors.

00:25:25.905 --> 00:25:27.485
MATT: Always.

00:25:27.485 --> 00:25:28.323
TALIESIN: Oh man.

00:25:28.323 --> 00:25:31.206
ASHLEY: I know, I was thinking. I can--

00:25:32.496 --> 00:25:34.096
We can obviously try to break through the door,

00:25:34.096 --> 00:25:39.096
but that's probably not going to happen.

00:25:43.003 --> 00:25:44.341
Give it another go.

00:25:44.341 --> 00:25:45.277
Put a little oil on there

00:25:45.277 --> 00:25:46.450
and see if it's slippy.

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:47.283
MARISHA: One more go.

00:25:47.283 --> 00:25:49.259
If that doesn't work, maybe we can freeze it,

00:25:49.259 --> 00:25:51.135
see if that negates the fire trap.

00:25:51.135 --> 00:25:52.526
TRAVIS: I mean, yeah.

00:25:52.526 --> 00:25:54.011
This is it, basically.

00:25:54.011 --> 00:25:56.548
MARISHA: I'm going to oil my tools a little.

00:25:56.548 --> 00:25:58.526
ASHLEY: Are we just going to be
hanging out in this little room?

00:25:58.526 --> 00:25:59.874
TRAVIS: Yeah, or we can try two other doors

00:25:59.874 --> 00:26:02.686
that have never been opened before.
MARISHA: Put oil on the lock.

00:26:02.686 --> 00:26:03.777
Rub it in.

00:26:03.777 --> 00:26:05.881
MATT: Make another check.

00:26:05.881 --> 00:26:09.381
MARISHA: Son of a bitch.
Just give me a natural 20 or something.

00:26:11.855 --> 00:26:13.855
It's just getting worse.

00:26:15.188 --> 00:26:16.203
10 total.

00:26:16.203 --> 00:26:17.120
MATT: 10 total.

00:26:18.231 --> 00:26:19.817
There's a confidence that comes with

00:26:19.817 --> 00:26:22.575
how easily it makes its way past the previous barriers

00:26:22.575 --> 00:26:23.815
now that the oil has been applied,

00:26:23.815 --> 00:26:26.242
and you're like, "All right, this is the one."

00:26:26.242 --> 00:26:28.575
And you feel it catch on the tumbler that's been a problem

00:26:28.575 --> 00:26:30.318
and you're like, "Yes, this is it!"

00:26:30.318 --> 00:26:32.780
And you twist, you hold it with the edge

00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:34.669
with your other hand and begin to pull up

00:26:34.669 --> 00:26:37.142
and you feel it give--

00:26:37.142 --> 00:26:38.501
(snapping)

00:26:38.501 --> 00:26:40.023
SAM: Oh no.

00:26:40.023 --> 00:26:42.095
MATT: You can go ahead and delete your thieves tools.

00:26:42.095 --> 00:26:43.796
(groaning)

00:26:43.796 --> 00:26:44.629
LIAM: Brutal.

00:26:45.869 --> 00:26:48.144
MARISHA: Someone else try it.
Fuck this door.

00:26:48.144 --> 00:26:51.090
TRAVIS: Yeah, sure! I got three daggers and a piton.

00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:53.149
Is that how you say that? A pi-ton, pitt-on?

00:26:53.149 --> 00:26:54.251
MATT: I've said pi-ton and got shit for it,

00:26:54.251 --> 00:26:55.119
because I don't know how it's pronounced.

00:26:55.119 --> 00:26:56.839
I think it's pitt-on.

00:26:56.839 --> 00:26:58.861
TRAVIS: What's smaller?

00:26:58.861 --> 00:26:59.713
Let's try a dagger.

00:26:59.713 --> 00:27:00.546
I'll try a dagger.

00:27:00.546 --> 00:27:03.350
I have a zero dex modifier, so this will be awesome.

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:05.776
What's your dex mod, Ashley?

00:27:05.776 --> 00:27:07.281
ASHLEY: +3, so I can--

00:27:07.281 --> 00:27:09.686
TRAVIS: You want to try with one of these daggers?

00:27:09.686 --> 00:27:10.519
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:27:11.355 --> 00:27:12.188
Yes.

00:27:15.296 --> 00:27:16.643
MATT: So you're trying to pick it with a dagger.

00:27:16.643 --> 00:27:17.896
LAURA: If you've got a natural 20 right now.

00:27:17.896 --> 00:27:18.729
TRAVIS: Nope.

00:27:18.729 --> 00:27:20.303
ASHLEY: I was going to say if you did get a natural 20

00:27:20.303 --> 00:27:21.931
let's just go with your roll.

00:27:21.931 --> 00:27:23.102
TRAVIS: Nope.
MATT: So you're trying to pick

00:27:23.102 --> 00:27:24.196
with the dagger?

00:27:24.196 --> 00:27:25.170
TRAVIS: She is.

00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:26.306
MATT: Okay.

00:27:26.306 --> 00:27:27.683
TRAVIS: I'm just warming this bitch up.

00:27:27.683 --> 00:27:29.933
(laughter)

00:27:32.062 --> 00:27:35.119
ASHLEY: Wait, advantage on dex
against effects that you can--

00:27:35.119 --> 00:27:37.045
MATT: That's savings throws against, like, explosions.

00:27:37.045 --> 00:27:38.044
ASHLEY: That's saving throw?

00:27:38.044 --> 00:27:39.065
That's fine.

00:27:39.065 --> 00:27:40.554
That would be 13 total.

00:27:40.554 --> 00:27:41.854
MATT: Yeah.

00:27:41.854 --> 00:27:43.396
You can only get the blade partially in

00:27:43.396 --> 00:27:46.286
because the broken tool is jammed in the lock

00:27:46.286 --> 00:27:48.657
and the lock is currently non-functional.

00:27:48.657 --> 00:27:50.307
MARISHA: That's what I was afraid of.

00:27:50.307 --> 00:27:55.227
MATT: This door will not be unlocked through normal means.

00:27:55.227 --> 00:27:57.764
ASHLEY: I'm going to just start pounding at the door.

00:27:57.764 --> 00:28:01.707
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make a strength check.

00:28:01.707 --> 00:28:03.634
Is this raging or not?

00:28:03.634 --> 00:28:04.467
ASHLEY: Raging.
MATT: All right.

00:28:04.467 --> 00:28:06.967
So you do get advantage on it.

00:28:10.445 --> 00:28:12.775
ASHLEY: Okay! Even better.

00:28:12.775 --> 00:28:14.108
That would be--

00:28:17.042 --> 00:28:18.458
22.

00:28:18.458 --> 00:28:19.291
MATT: 22.

00:28:20.431 --> 00:28:22.442
In that moment of frustration as you all stand there

00:28:22.442 --> 00:28:24.840
glancing around the space, you hear--

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:26.595
(banging)

00:28:26.595 --> 00:28:28.015
You glance over and see Yasha

00:28:28.015 --> 00:28:31.687
is just rage kicking this door once, twice,

00:28:31.687 --> 00:28:34.020
again, and again, and again.

00:28:35.643 --> 00:28:39.762
And you think what bad things can happen

00:28:39.762 --> 00:28:42.512
when rage-kicking a trapped door.

00:28:43.384 --> 00:28:45.213
And as you begin to go in

00:28:45.213 --> 00:28:48.596
to try and say something to stop her

00:28:48.596 --> 00:28:50.623
or prevent the circumstance--
TRAVIS: I wasn't trying to stop her.

00:28:50.623 --> 00:28:52.542
MATT: -- her fury and strength still pushing into it,

00:28:52.542 --> 00:28:56.858
you watch as the wood begins to give.

00:28:56.858 --> 00:28:59.372
And with one final kick,

00:29:00.232 --> 00:29:04.357
the door slams open, breaking off of

00:29:04.357 --> 00:29:07.354
the grip that the handle once had.

00:29:07.354 --> 00:29:11.937
It opens up and you can see before it the open doorway.

00:29:13.213 --> 00:29:14.046
So

00:29:15.282 --> 00:29:17.807
this hallway before you,

00:29:20.107 --> 00:29:23.275
due to the nature of this broken door,

00:29:23.275 --> 00:29:26.080
is drifting away from you.

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:26.930
MARISHA: Go! Go, go!

00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:28.763
TRAVIS: Run, run, run!
ASHLEY: Run!

00:29:29.614 --> 00:29:31.478
MATT: All right, so you all start running in.

00:29:31.478 --> 00:29:33.585
I need you all to make an athletics check for me

00:29:33.585 --> 00:29:36.195
to leap as the connection between this chamber,

00:29:36.195 --> 00:29:40.204
this egress, and the hallway is been severed

00:29:40.204 --> 00:29:42.007
and it is drifting.

00:29:42.007 --> 00:29:43.141
LAURA: What was the name of the ball?

00:29:43.141 --> 00:29:45.295
It was Mage's Bane or something?

00:29:45.295 --> 00:29:46.941
MATT: Mage's Bane.
LAURA: Mage's Bane?

00:29:46.941 --> 00:29:48.500
TRAVIS: 20 flat. 14.

00:29:49.478 --> 00:29:50.311
20.

00:29:51.441 --> 00:29:52.905
MARISHA: 26.

00:29:52.905 --> 00:29:54.445
ASHLEY: 15.

00:29:54.445 --> 00:29:55.716
MATT: And yours again?
TRAVIS: 20.

00:29:55.716 --> 00:29:56.915
MATT: 20?

00:29:56.915 --> 00:30:00.350
Okay, you all quickly run and leap

00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:02.480
into this black void space.

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:04.920
The in-between where these various pockets

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:07.274
of mage-crafted dimensions

00:30:07.274 --> 00:30:09.306
are tenuously tethered to each other.

00:30:09.306 --> 00:30:12.103
This tether now broken.

00:30:12.103 --> 00:30:14.640
In that space as you leap and you see

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:16.774
the edge of this hallway beginning to pull away

00:30:16.774 --> 00:30:20.378
and the stone beginning to break and bend

00:30:20.378 --> 00:30:22.961
at the edges where it unravels,

00:30:23.913 --> 00:30:26.638
you feel like you might just fall up or fall down

00:30:26.638 --> 00:30:27.471
or to the side.

00:30:27.471 --> 00:30:28.831
Suddenly, there's that moment

00:30:28.831 --> 00:30:33.164
where gravity and direction doesn't make much sense.

00:30:35.155 --> 00:30:36.901
Beauregard, you land.

00:30:36.901 --> 00:30:39.309
Fjord, you land and you feel the bricks give way

00:30:39.309 --> 00:30:40.997
and you just continue to push forward.

00:30:40.997 --> 00:30:45.939
Yasha, you catch the lip of it and you feel it give way.

00:30:45.939 --> 00:30:48.546
It's like stepping on the edge of a water bed,

00:30:48.546 --> 00:30:50.826
where it just gives underneath your weight

00:30:50.826 --> 00:30:54.816
and you begin to lose yourself, your balance begins to shift

00:30:54.816 --> 00:30:56.572
and you reach out and grab the side of the wall

00:30:56.572 --> 00:30:57.953
and that begins to give as well.

00:30:57.953 --> 00:31:01.454
You've made the leap, but the actual tunnel is collapsing.

00:31:01.454 --> 00:31:02.287
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:31:05.352 --> 00:31:08.019
I am going to cast Radiant Soul.

00:31:09.132 --> 00:31:13.512
Bamf out my wings and try to find some--

00:31:13.512 --> 00:31:16.197
Just fly through the hallway.
MATT: All right.

00:31:16.197 --> 00:31:18.720
You guys watch as the Yasha begins to tumble backward

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:21.536
into the space and then,

00:31:21.536 --> 00:31:22.744
the glowing, white-feathered wings

00:31:22.744 --> 00:31:25.422
erupt from behind her shoulders.

00:31:25.422 --> 00:31:29.261
And with that, you pick up your momentum

00:31:29.261 --> 00:31:30.849
to pursue the path that your friends

00:31:30.849 --> 00:31:32.029
are currently there waiting.

00:31:32.029 --> 00:31:33.165
And she gains on you.

00:31:33.165 --> 00:31:36.400
This does enable you to continue through this hallway

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:38.817
before it entirely collapses.

00:31:39.922 --> 00:31:41.834
As you all push past,

00:31:41.834 --> 00:31:43.825
you come towards the edge of the doorway

00:31:43.825 --> 00:31:47.323
into the familiar hexagonal chamber.

00:31:47.323 --> 00:31:49.148
It is at a heavy side angle to the left.

00:31:49.148 --> 00:31:50.704
Everything is this odd side.

00:31:50.704 --> 00:31:53.991
It's like coming into a room from the wrong element,

00:31:53.991 --> 00:31:56.360
but as soon as you come through that space

00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:59.383
you shift and then gravity rights itself

00:31:59.383 --> 00:32:02.022
into the orientation of this room.

00:32:02.022 --> 00:32:05.273
You see in this chamber the familiar study,

00:32:05.273 --> 00:32:09.253
where the large portrait of Halas would be,

00:32:09.253 --> 00:32:12.420
but apparently has been taken down.

00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:16.929
You can see the various book cases are currently emptied

00:32:16.929 --> 00:32:18.936
and the desk drawers are partially ajar,

00:32:18.936 --> 00:32:22.263
and themselves also without contents.

00:32:22.263 --> 00:32:24.210
Indeed, this place has been ransacked.

00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:26.935
TRAVIS: Oh, that removes temptation!

00:32:26.935 --> 00:32:28.132
MARISHA: Yeah. Yeah, it does.

00:32:28.132 --> 00:32:30.713
ASHLEY: Well, we got through, ha-ha.

00:32:30.713 --> 00:32:33.590
MATT: Except for a handful of books

00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:35.153
that remain on the bookshelves.

00:32:35.153 --> 00:32:37.710
Three in particular scattered amongst the room.

00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:41.646
And there is the stained glass up above,

00:32:41.646 --> 00:32:43.532
the heavy right side bookshelves,

00:32:43.532 --> 00:32:44.759
where you can still see

00:32:44.759 --> 00:32:47.885
the wide network of the various outer and inner planes,

00:32:47.885 --> 00:32:50.539
all interwoven and plotted out

00:32:50.539 --> 00:32:54.625
and the familiar small red gem amongst them.

00:32:54.625 --> 00:32:56.763
TRAVIS: I can hear what you're thinking.

00:32:56.763 --> 00:32:57.600
MARISHA: I didn't say shit.

00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.630
TRAVIS: You can go look at the books real fast.

00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:02.587
Because it's probably been a month already.

00:33:02.587 --> 00:33:04.419
MARISHA: Oh, that's not what I was thinking!

00:33:04.419 --> 00:33:05.514
ASHLEY: I'll assist.

00:33:05.514 --> 00:33:08.233
TRAVIS: What were you thinking?
ASHLEY: You want to give a browsies.

00:33:08.233 --> 00:33:11.447
MARISHA: Oh, no, I was just wondering.

00:33:11.447 --> 00:33:13.447
Going to poke some gems.

00:33:14.424 --> 00:33:16.529
TRAVIS: Some other gems?

00:33:16.529 --> 00:33:17.551
ASHLEY: Wait, what are the gems?

00:33:17.551 --> 00:33:18.973
The gems were something?

00:33:18.973 --> 00:33:20.564
TRAVIS: So on that stained glass window,

00:33:20.564 --> 00:33:22.455
if we touch the red one in the middle

00:33:22.455 --> 00:33:26.121
it'll send us to the next place we need to go immediately.

00:33:26.121 --> 00:33:29.986
But do you want us to look at the three books or we just go?

00:33:29.986 --> 00:33:30.819
ASHLEY: Let's look at the three books.

00:33:30.819 --> 00:33:32.481
MARISHA: All right, let's look at the three books.

00:33:32.481 --> 00:33:33.377
ASHLEY: We'll do it fast.

00:33:33.377 --> 00:33:34.508
Let's all pick up a book.

00:33:34.508 --> 00:33:36.291
TRAVIS: (yelling) Don't touch a book!

00:33:36.291 --> 00:33:37.374
ASHLEY: Okay, okay!

00:33:39.307 --> 00:33:41.068
MARISHA: I'll take this one over here.

00:33:41.068 --> 00:33:42.084
TRAVIS: Just look, don't touch!

00:33:42.084 --> 00:33:43.179
MARISHA: I'm just looking!

00:33:43.179 --> 00:33:46.132
MATT: Okay, so there's one closest to you,

00:33:46.132 --> 00:33:47.644
which is to the right of you

00:33:47.644 --> 00:33:49.669
as you head towards the upward area

00:33:49.669 --> 00:33:51.052
to where the stained glass is.

00:33:51.052 --> 00:33:52.732
There's one that's on the far left side

00:33:52.732 --> 00:33:54.656
in one of the smaller bookshelves

00:33:54.656 --> 00:33:55.768
resting to the right

00:33:55.768 --> 00:33:58.039
underneath where the portrait used to be.

00:33:58.039 --> 00:34:00.186
And there's one on the very, very far end that you can

00:34:00.186 --> 00:34:02.118
just barely make--
TRAVIS: Okay. We'll all take a book.

00:34:02.118 --> 00:34:03.159
MARISHA: Okay. Okay.
TRAVIS: Fine.

00:34:03.159 --> 00:34:04.554
We split up. One, one, one.

00:34:04.554 --> 00:34:05.387
LIAM: Shit.

00:34:05.387 --> 00:34:07.443
MATT: Okay. Who's going to which one?

00:34:07.443 --> 00:34:10.282
MARISHA: I'll take the one by the portrait.

00:34:10.282 --> 00:34:11.704
TRAVIS: I'll take the one far away.

00:34:11.704 --> 00:34:14.872
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll go far left cubby corner.

00:34:14.872 --> 00:34:15.705
MATT: Okay.

00:34:15.705 --> 00:34:16.726
TRAVIS: Also! Also!

00:34:16.726 --> 00:34:19.592
Remember, the furniture here can turn into shit.

00:34:19.592 --> 00:34:21.200
So if it moves, you fuck it up

00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:23.288
and then you go to the stained glass window immediately

00:34:23.288 --> 00:34:24.961
and touch the red.

00:34:24.961 --> 00:34:25.814
ASHLEY: Touch the red stone.

00:34:25.814 --> 00:34:26.906
TRAVIS: Yeah. I point out

00:34:26.906 --> 00:34:28.416
the red stone in the stained glass window

00:34:28.416 --> 00:34:31.002
that hasn't changed, right?

00:34:31.002 --> 00:34:31.860
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:34.369
TRAVIS: Fucking Mercer!

00:34:34.369 --> 00:34:36.546
(laughter)

00:34:36.546 --> 00:34:37.379
19!

00:34:39.183 --> 00:34:40.641
MATT: Looks pretty much the same as you recall.

00:34:40.641 --> 00:34:41.474
TRAVIS: God.

00:34:43.222 --> 00:34:44.055
MARISHA: "Pretty much the same--"
MATT: All right.

00:34:44.055 --> 00:34:46.012
So who's doing what with which book?

00:34:46.012 --> 00:34:48.126
MARISHA: I just want to read the spine.

00:34:48.126 --> 00:34:50.121
MATT: You read the spine and there is no title on it.

00:34:50.121 --> 00:34:52.389
There is a chain wrapped around it, though.

00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:54.598
A blacked chain that's around the binding.

00:34:54.598 --> 00:34:55.450
TRAVIS: Dicks.

00:34:55.450 --> 00:34:56.571
MARISHA: It's got a chain?

00:34:57.683 --> 00:34:59.563
TRAVIS: You have a chain around yours?

00:34:59.563 --> 00:35:01.623
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Don't touch it.

00:35:01.623 --> 00:35:03.129
ASHLEY: Do you have a chain around yours?

00:35:03.129 --> 00:35:04.203
TRAVIS: Do I?

00:35:04.203 --> 00:35:06.823
MATT: Not wrapped around it, but where the--

00:35:06.823 --> 00:35:08.293
Not on the spine, but on the inside,

00:35:08.293 --> 00:35:10.643
you can see there's some sort of a locking mechanism

00:35:10.643 --> 00:35:11.763
that closes the book

00:35:11.763 --> 00:35:13.383
that is locked to the back wall.

00:35:13.383 --> 00:35:15.773
It is fixed to the back of the bookcase.

00:35:15.773 --> 00:35:17.970
TRAVIS: Oh, it's locked to the actual thing?

00:35:17.970 --> 00:35:20.513
MATT: Mm-hmm.
TRAVIS: Mine's locked.

00:35:20.513 --> 00:35:21.476
It's stuck to it.

00:35:21.476 --> 00:35:23.553
MARISHA: Like a diary?
TRAVIS: What?

00:35:23.553 --> 00:35:24.761
MARISHA: Like a diary?
TRAVIS: I don't know.

00:35:24.761 --> 00:35:26.485
It doesn't have anything on the outside, just got a lock.

00:35:26.485 --> 00:35:27.318
MARISHA: Oh.

00:35:27.318 --> 00:35:29.185
ASHLEY: Should we just take them
and then look at them later?

00:35:29.185 --> 00:35:30.018
TRAVIS: Mine's locked!
ASHLEY: Or are they actually

00:35:30.018 --> 00:35:31.443
connected to the thing?

00:35:31.443 --> 00:35:33.071
TRAVIS: What's yours look like?

00:35:33.071 --> 00:35:36.673
MARISHA: Does yours have any chains or locks or lockets?

00:35:36.673 --> 00:35:38.030
ASHLEY: Mine's ready to go.

00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:38.863
And what is it?

00:35:38.863 --> 00:35:40.430
Is it chained?

00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:41.263
I don't touch it.

00:35:41.263 --> 00:35:42.453
MATT: It doesn't appear to be chained.

00:35:42.453 --> 00:35:45.696
ASHLEY: I'll check the spine to see if I can see anything.

00:35:46.863 --> 00:35:48.313
MATT: What languages do you know?

00:35:49.983 --> 00:35:52.703
ASHLEY: Abyssal, Celestial, and Common.

00:35:52.703 --> 00:35:54.243
MATT: You do not recognize the text

00:35:54.243 --> 00:35:55.713
on the spine of this book.

00:35:55.713 --> 00:35:56.593
ASHLEY: It says something!

00:35:56.593 --> 00:35:58.253
It says something, but I can't read it.

00:35:58.253 --> 00:35:59.493
TRAVIS: Yeah, I mean, look.

00:35:59.493 --> 00:36:02.395
If a super powerful wizard like Yussa came in here

00:36:02.395 --> 00:36:05.543
and took everything except these three,

00:36:05.543 --> 00:36:06.964
there's a reason.

00:36:06.964 --> 00:36:09.133
ASHLEY: Yeah, but what if Caleb could use them?

00:36:09.133 --> 00:36:10.343
TRAVIS: I want to give it to Caleb, too,

00:36:10.343 --> 00:36:12.303
but also I want the three of us

00:36:12.303 --> 00:36:13.726
to be able to go back to Caleb.

00:36:13.726 --> 00:36:15.473
ASHLEY: Fair, fair, fair, fair, fair.

00:36:15.473 --> 00:36:17.242
MARISHA: Okay, let's go.
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:36:17.242 --> 00:36:18.183
ASHLEY: You're just going to leave them?

00:36:18.183 --> 00:36:19.016
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:36:19.016 --> 00:36:20.523
ASHLEY: We're not even going to know what they are?

00:36:20.523 --> 00:36:22.728
TRAVIS: We just got-- We barely--
ASHLEY: I hate this.

00:36:22.728 --> 00:36:24.320
TRAVIS: -- escaped Trent twice.

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:25.753
I'm not fucking around with death books.

00:36:25.753 --> 00:36:27.643
ASHLEY: Can you at least just look at the spine of this one

00:36:27.643 --> 00:36:29.413
to see if any of you can read it?

00:36:29.413 --> 00:36:30.533
TRAVIS: I read Orcish and Common.

00:36:30.533 --> 00:36:31.993
I'm pretty sure it's not in Orcish.

00:36:31.993 --> 00:36:34.526
MARISHA: I read Deep Speech and Undercommon.

00:36:35.733 --> 00:36:36.983
MATT: None of you can recognize the text

00:36:36.983 --> 00:36:38.423
from the spine of this book.
ASHLEY: Goddamn it.

00:36:38.423 --> 00:36:39.256
Let's go.

00:36:40.153 --> 00:36:41.873
Does yours say anything?

00:36:41.873 --> 00:36:42.706
MATT: No.
TRAVIS: No.

00:36:42.706 --> 00:36:43.733
It's just got a lock.

00:36:43.733 --> 00:36:47.223
MARISHA: Being a Cobalt Soul Monk who can speak languages,

00:36:47.223 --> 00:36:50.683
can I deduce what the language might be

00:36:50.683 --> 00:36:52.258
even though I can't read it?

00:36:54.035 --> 00:36:54.868
MATT: You have that monk ability

00:36:54.868 --> 00:36:57.163
where you can understand languages,

00:36:57.163 --> 00:36:58.343
but not read them, correct?

00:36:58.343 --> 00:37:02.653
MARISHA: Yeah, I can speak them, but I can't read it.

00:37:02.653 --> 00:37:05.263
MATT: Yeah, if you don't have
this particular language chosen,

00:37:05.263 --> 00:37:06.963
then you would not unfortunately.

00:37:06.963 --> 00:37:10.434
You recognize the script looks somewhat Elvish in nature.

00:37:11.853 --> 00:37:13.893
It looks like an older form of Elvish or Sylvan,

00:37:13.893 --> 00:37:15.563
but it's not something that you're familiar with.

00:37:15.563 --> 00:37:17.253
TRAVIS: To be fair, mine is attached, is yours?

00:37:17.253 --> 00:37:19.492
Can you pick it up and bring it with you?

00:37:19.492 --> 00:37:20.325
MARISHA: I think so.
TRAVIS: Or is it chained

00:37:20.325 --> 00:37:21.273
to the furniture?

00:37:21.273 --> 00:37:22.323
MARISHA: I'm going to reach out

00:37:23.511 --> 00:37:24.694
and touch it.

00:37:26.373 --> 00:37:27.423
MATT: You touch the book.

00:37:28.383 --> 00:37:29.743
MARISHA: Can I pull it off the shelf?

00:37:29.743 --> 00:37:30.576
MATT: You can.

00:37:30.576 --> 00:37:31.409
Or you try to.

00:37:31.409 --> 00:37:33.283
As you pull-- (crunches)

00:37:33.283 --> 00:37:34.116
It's tethered.

00:37:34.116 --> 00:37:34.993
There is a chain on the back end.

00:37:34.993 --> 00:37:38.907
And as you tug it, you hear something else in the chamber.

00:37:38.907 --> 00:37:41.162
(gently rumbles)
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:37:41.162 --> 00:37:42.055
TRAVIS: Gotta go.
ASHLEY: Gotta go.

00:37:42.055 --> 00:37:44.100
TRAVIS: Gotta go.
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:44.933
TRAVIS: We run, we run.

00:37:44.933 --> 00:37:45.993
MARISHA: What's happening?
TRAVIS: We run.

00:37:45.993 --> 00:37:48.193
MATT: One of the bookshelves on the opposite right side,

00:37:48.193 --> 00:37:50.973
right where you are standing, Ashley, begins to shift

00:37:52.205 --> 00:37:53.363
into the floor, and behind it,

00:37:53.363 --> 00:37:55.678
you can see revealed what was hidden behind it,

00:37:55.678 --> 00:37:57.413
a humanoid shape

00:37:57.413 --> 00:38:01.043
made of carved brown clay--

00:38:01.043 --> 00:38:05.493
MARISHA: Oh, oh god.
MATT: About nine feet tall.

00:38:05.493 --> 00:38:07.373
And as it slowly descends past,

00:38:07.373 --> 00:38:09.613
its head goes towards you,

00:38:09.613 --> 00:38:11.043
and its eyes flash.

00:38:11.043 --> 00:38:12.997
MARISHA: Let's go.
ASHLEY: Go, go, go, go, go, go.

00:38:12.997 --> 00:38:14.593
TRAVIS: Yeah, got to go, got to go, got to go.

00:38:14.593 --> 00:38:15.426
MATT: All right.

00:38:15.426 --> 00:38:18.373
So you all rush up towards the--

00:38:18.373 --> 00:38:19.373
TRAVIS: I'd pick you up and fly,

00:38:19.373 --> 00:38:21.798
but you can run up walls and shit, and you have wings.

00:38:21.798 --> 00:38:23.593
MARISHA: I'm good.
TRAVIS: I'm like-- (yells)

00:38:23.593 --> 00:38:24.552
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

00:38:24.552 --> 00:38:27.178
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll just-- with what-- I mean--

00:38:27.178 --> 00:38:28.888
MATT: The wings would have probably dropped by this point

00:38:28.888 --> 00:38:30.716
they only last for about a minute.
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:38:30.716 --> 00:38:32.446
MATT: But you run pretty quick.
ASHLEY: Yes.

00:38:32.446 --> 00:38:36.033
MATT: So as you all dart up to above these bookshelves

00:38:36.033 --> 00:38:37.233
to get to that stained glass,

00:38:37.233 --> 00:38:40.103
you begin to hear-- (stomps)

00:38:40.103 --> 00:38:42.143
This bookshelf, as it's lowering,

00:38:42.143 --> 00:38:43.933
is lowering too slow for this creature.

00:38:43.933 --> 00:38:45.716
And you can see the wood splintering.

00:38:46.563 --> 00:38:48.343
And bits of wood and splinters

00:38:48.343 --> 00:38:50.643
are scattering across the stone floor.

00:38:50.643 --> 00:38:53.600
You all get to the top, and the stained glass is there.

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:55.249
TRAVIS: It's right here. Touch it at the same.

00:38:55.249 --> 00:38:57.282
One, two, three. Boop!

00:38:57.282 --> 00:38:59.483
MATT: As you all touch it, suddenly-- (crashes)

00:38:59.483 --> 00:39:02.513
the stained glass shatters into a thousand pieces,

00:39:02.513 --> 00:39:05.943
revealing this black space star-filled void in front of you.

00:39:05.943 --> 00:39:08.043
And with that, this-- (inhaling)

00:39:08.043 --> 00:39:12.283
This horrendous sucking sound fills your ears

00:39:12.283 --> 00:39:15.353
as you feel yourself suddenly dragged into it.

00:39:15.353 --> 00:39:18.623
This force of gravity just plucks and pulls all of you

00:39:18.623 --> 00:39:20.673
into this black, vacuous void.

00:39:20.673 --> 00:39:23.413
You have no ability to withstand it, and you just give in

00:39:23.413 --> 00:39:27.016
as you are plunged into nothing, into space, into void.

00:39:27.923 --> 00:39:31.033
With that, as the glass around you dissipates,

00:39:31.033 --> 00:39:33.853
you see it reform behind you,

00:39:33.853 --> 00:39:37.083
and the stained glass just fades away into nowhere.

00:39:37.083 --> 00:39:39.693
And then suddenly, you're falling.

00:39:39.693 --> 00:39:40.763
You're falling.

00:39:40.763 --> 00:39:42.263
You're falling, and you look down below,

00:39:42.263 --> 00:39:45.083
and you can see stone rushing towards you

00:39:45.083 --> 00:39:49.808
as you all, in a flash of light, plummet approximately...

00:39:51.095 --> 00:39:53.882
30 feet out of the air

00:39:53.882 --> 00:39:54.923
onto a stone floor.

00:39:54.923 --> 00:39:57.562
I need you all to make an acrobatics check for me, please.

00:39:57.562 --> 00:40:00.078
MARISHA: Slow Fall as well.

00:40:00.078 --> 00:40:01.119
ASHLEY: Ooh!

00:40:01.119 --> 00:40:02.294
Natural 20.

00:40:03.873 --> 00:40:06.082
TRAVIS: Five.
MARISHA: Natural 1.

00:40:06.082 --> 00:40:08.053
SAM: But don't you have monk shit?

00:40:08.053 --> 00:40:09.976
MARISHA: Yeah, it's fine.
MATT: Not for everything.

00:40:10.853 --> 00:40:12.553
MARISHA: I have Slow Fall.

00:40:13.483 --> 00:40:14.878
MATT: You do have Slow Fall, that's right.

00:40:14.878 --> 00:40:17.113
MARISHA: Yeah, I negate fall damage.

00:40:17.113 --> 00:40:20.623
MATT: Yeah, well, it would be 13
points of bludgeoning damage.

00:40:20.623 --> 00:40:21.623
You take half,

00:40:21.623 --> 00:40:24.413
so that's six points of bludgeoning damage to you.

00:40:24.413 --> 00:40:26.403
ASHLEY: Six points?
MATT: Yep. 13 to you, Fjord,

00:40:26.403 --> 00:40:28.703
and you take, I'm pretty sure, none

00:40:28.703 --> 00:40:30.583
because I'm wrong, she does have dope monk shit.

00:40:30.583 --> 00:40:31.416
I totally forgot.

00:40:31.416 --> 00:40:33.696
TRAVIS: My sailor's ability to take full damage.

00:40:33.696 --> 00:40:36.343
(laughter)

00:40:36.343 --> 00:40:39.153
TALIESIN: Fuck up your superhero fall and it's like, "Ah!"

00:40:39.153 --> 00:40:40.603
MARISHA: Ah, man.
TALIESIN: Yeah, don't look good.

00:40:40.603 --> 00:40:42.143
MARISHA: It's not a great three-point landing.

00:40:42.143 --> 00:40:43.543
Not going to lie.

00:40:43.543 --> 00:40:45.076
MATT: But you all look around the space,

00:40:45.076 --> 00:40:47.023
and you are now getting up in this chamber

00:40:47.023 --> 00:40:48.803
that is familiar to two of you.

00:40:48.803 --> 00:40:50.813
It is a Y-shaped chamber

00:40:50.813 --> 00:40:53.013
with these two wide ridges

00:40:53.013 --> 00:40:54.643
on this side,

00:40:54.643 --> 00:40:57.393
and you're in the left-hand side, in the middle area.

00:40:57.393 --> 00:41:00.601
And on the far, far end, you can see a pedestal of some kind

00:41:00.601 --> 00:41:02.903
with an orb affixed to it.

00:41:02.903 --> 00:41:06.003
This was where the dragon was previously encountered.

00:41:06.003 --> 00:41:08.213
You can see the grooves that run along the ground

00:41:08.213 --> 00:41:10.503
that splinter off into the two other sides of the chamber.

00:41:10.503 --> 00:41:11.873
TRAVIS: Any carcass?

00:41:11.873 --> 00:41:12.943
MATT: No carcass.
TRAVIS: They cleaned.

00:41:12.943 --> 00:41:13.813
This is our way out.

00:41:13.813 --> 00:41:17.103
That pedestal will form at the end of either of those halls.

00:41:17.103 --> 00:41:20.753
We have to charge those sigils with cold energy.

00:41:20.753 --> 00:41:22.263
I have that.
ASHLEY: You do.

00:41:22.263 --> 00:41:25.023
TRAVIS: And then it should present us a way out of here.

00:41:26.433 --> 00:41:27.772
ASHLEY: Okay.
TRAVIS: Ready to go?

00:41:27.772 --> 00:41:28.755
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MARISHA: Ready.

00:41:28.755 --> 00:41:29.893
TRAVIS: Anything in this room that's different

00:41:29.893 --> 00:41:31.133
or that catches our eye?

00:41:31.133 --> 00:41:33.883
MATT: Make a perception check.
TRAVIS: Any locked fucking books?

00:41:35.035 --> 00:41:36.093
Ooh, 18.

00:41:36.093 --> 00:41:37.623
These are good perception checks.

00:41:37.623 --> 00:41:38.913
MATT: Good.

00:41:38.913 --> 00:41:40.076
Nothing at the moment.

00:41:41.433 --> 00:41:43.303
TRAVIS: I'm going to do this quickly.

00:41:43.303 --> 00:41:47.613
I will cast Armor of Agathys on myself--

00:41:47.613 --> 00:41:48.446
MATT: All right.

00:41:48.446 --> 00:41:50.811
TRAVIS: At 1st-level for this.

00:41:51.713 --> 00:41:53.943
And I will run down to either of the two.

00:41:53.943 --> 00:41:55.763
Let's say left first--
MATT: Okay.

00:41:55.763 --> 00:41:56.883
TRAVIS: At the split and find that--

00:41:56.883 --> 00:41:57.716
MATT: So you head to the left side

00:41:57.716 --> 00:41:58.783
and there, you see this is right there,

00:41:58.783 --> 00:42:00.443
as you approach and step within its space,

00:42:00.443 --> 00:42:03.013
the ice energy that's gathered around your torso

00:42:03.013 --> 00:42:05.433
begins to break off in chunks,

00:42:05.433 --> 00:42:07.793
and it all begins to form into the sigil.

00:42:07.793 --> 00:42:09.243
It glows, and you watch

00:42:09.243 --> 00:42:12.013
as the groove in the ground begins to alight

00:42:12.013 --> 00:42:13.896
with crackling arcane energy.

00:42:15.083 --> 00:42:17.563
It hits the center point and then reflects,

00:42:17.563 --> 00:42:18.473
bending off,

00:42:18.473 --> 00:42:20.403
heading towards the far end of the chamber.

00:42:20.403 --> 00:42:22.613
And you both see that sphere on the opposite end

00:42:22.613 --> 00:42:25.463
begin to faintly glow on top the pedestal.

00:42:25.463 --> 00:42:26.923
ASHLEY: Is that-- that's supposed to happen?

00:42:26.923 --> 00:42:27.944
This is normal?
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

00:42:27.944 --> 00:42:28.883
MARISHA: That's normal, that's good.

00:42:28.883 --> 00:42:30.591
TRAVIS: I start running back towards
the middle, and I'm like,

00:42:30.591 --> 00:42:32.593
(pants) one more.

00:42:32.593 --> 00:42:33.793
I head down the other way.

00:42:33.793 --> 00:42:34.753
MATT: All right, as you're doing that,

00:42:34.753 --> 00:42:36.353
you begin to hear, both of you,

00:42:36.353 --> 00:42:38.311
this distant shattering sound.

00:42:41.683 --> 00:42:44.053
And this faint tearing noise.

00:42:44.053 --> 00:42:47.431
As you glance above, you see in the stone ceiling

00:42:47.431 --> 00:42:52.431
this line tears open into a black starscape.

00:42:53.162 --> 00:42:54.452
MARISHA: Mm, go fast.

00:42:54.452 --> 00:42:55.580
TRAVIS: I'm going fast.
MATT: All right.

00:42:55.580 --> 00:42:59.487
ASHLEY: I take out the Holy Avenger to be ready,

00:42:59.487 --> 00:43:00.713
just in case.
MATT: Okay.

00:43:00.713 --> 00:43:03.283
It is unattuned, so it just acts as a standard greatsword,

00:43:03.283 --> 00:43:04.546
just so you know.

00:43:05.433 --> 00:43:07.022
All right, you rush to the other side,

00:43:07.022 --> 00:43:08.973
and there's the secondary crystal there waiting for you

00:43:08.973 --> 00:43:11.415
with the glyphs around the base of it. What do you do?

00:43:11.415 --> 00:43:13.636
TRAVIS: I run up-- (mumbles)

00:43:13.636 --> 00:43:14.984
and I headbutt it.

00:43:17.623 --> 00:43:18.456
Yep.

00:43:21.223 --> 00:43:22.056
Nothing?

00:43:23.963 --> 00:43:25.116
MATT: What are you trying to do here?

00:43:25.116 --> 00:43:26.553
MARISHA: Armor of Agathys.
TRAVIS: Armor of Agathys.

00:43:26.553 --> 00:43:28.186
MATT: You've cast it once, and it's gone.

00:43:28.186 --> 00:43:29.603
LAURA: You need to cast it again.
TRAVIS: Armor of Agathys,

00:43:29.603 --> 00:43:31.033
1st-level again.

00:43:31.033 --> 00:43:32.576
LIAM: But I like that you did headbutt it first.

00:43:32.576 --> 00:43:34.140
TRAVIS: Ow!

00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:34.973
Fuck!
(laughing)

00:43:34.973 --> 00:43:36.993
MATT: As the singular trickle of blood

00:43:36.993 --> 00:43:38.472
drips down your forehead--

00:43:38.472 --> 00:43:39.783
(laughter)

00:43:39.783 --> 00:43:40.878
LIAM: It's pretty stressful.

00:43:40.878 --> 00:43:43.898
TRAVIS: It needs blood magic, this one. (yells)

00:43:43.898 --> 00:43:45.333
MATT: And you can't cast it at 1st-level.

00:43:45.333 --> 00:43:47.422
You always cast at max level as a warlock.

00:43:47.422 --> 00:43:48.793
TRAVIS: Fuck!

00:43:48.793 --> 00:43:50.045
MATT: I mean, it's fine.

00:43:50.045 --> 00:43:51.353
It doesn't matter.
TRAVIS: That's not true.

00:43:51.353 --> 00:43:52.563
MATT: You only get spell slots as it is, yeah.

00:43:52.563 --> 00:43:55.933
TRAVIS: I get three 1st-level slots
and three five-level slots.

00:43:55.933 --> 00:43:57.493
MATT: No, you don't.

00:43:57.493 --> 00:43:59.463
TRAVIS: According to D&amp;D Beyond, I do.

00:44:01.473 --> 00:44:03.033
MATT: Oh, wait, no, as a paladin, that's right.

00:44:03.033 --> 00:44:05.575
I'm sorry, I miss-- so yeah, you can cast both ways.

00:44:05.575 --> 00:44:06.691
You are correct, you can do that.

00:44:06.691 --> 00:44:07.787
I'm sorry, I forgot that for a moment.

00:44:07.787 --> 00:44:10.203
It's been a while, that's on me.

00:44:10.203 --> 00:44:11.580
Travis got a gotcha moment on me.

00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:12.413
Well done.

00:44:12.413 --> 00:44:14.529
(buzzing noise)

00:44:14.529 --> 00:44:15.362
LIAM: Uh-oh.

00:44:15.362 --> 00:44:17.203
LAURA: What is that?
ASHLEY: What is that?

00:44:17.203 --> 00:44:18.036
A cat toy?
MARISHA: He's coming.

00:44:18.036 --> 00:44:20.543
LIAM: The chamber is collapsing.
MARISHA: He's coming!

00:44:20.543 --> 00:44:21.376
LAURA: What is it?

00:44:21.376 --> 00:44:22.380
TALIESIN: It sounds like a tiny--

00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:23.888
SAM: Is it your vibrator?

00:44:23.888 --> 00:44:25.233
MATT: That's Travis's personal massager.

00:44:25.233 --> 00:44:27.323
TRAVIS: It's on the electric side, I think.

00:44:27.323 --> 00:44:28.754
LIAM: Oh, jeez, don't die.

00:44:28.754 --> 00:44:30.573
SAM: Is that a live wire?
MARISHA: What was that?

00:44:30.573 --> 00:44:32.503
TRAVIS: Something's spinning up over here.

00:44:32.503 --> 00:44:33.336
MATT: Interesting.

00:44:33.336 --> 00:44:35.375
SAM: Spinning up?
TRAVIS: Is there a motor

00:44:35.375 --> 00:44:36.913
for your fog machine?

00:44:36.913 --> 00:44:37.953
MATT: I don't have a--

00:44:37.953 --> 00:44:39.293
I haven't used it in a while.

00:44:39.293 --> 00:44:41.303
TRAVIS: It sounds like it's for the fog machine.

00:44:41.303 --> 00:44:42.511
MATT: It might have been something that accidentally

00:44:42.511 --> 00:44:44.453
got enclosed there.

00:44:44.453 --> 00:44:46.112
Wow, interesting.

00:44:46.112 --> 00:44:47.753
MARISHA: Do we need to unplug it?

00:44:47.753 --> 00:44:49.731
MATT: No, I think we're okay.

00:44:49.731 --> 00:44:50.920
TRAVIS: We should, it's spinning up.

00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:51.993
MATT: Is it? Okay.

00:44:51.993 --> 00:44:53.323
SAM: It's spinning?

00:44:53.323 --> 00:44:54.853
TRAVIS: Yeah, something, whatever's doing it.

00:44:54.853 --> 00:44:56.573
MARISHA: Hang on, can we have a TD?

00:44:56.573 --> 00:44:57.662
Sorry, can we have Jerry?

00:44:57.662 --> 00:44:58.949
MATT: I got it, I got it.

00:44:58.949 --> 00:45:00.383
TRAVIS: You get it?

00:45:00.383 --> 00:45:01.383
MATT: I turned it off up here.

00:45:01.383 --> 00:45:03.232
It looks like it was plugged to the thing. (laughs)

00:45:03.232 --> 00:45:04.373
TRAVIS: Oh, gotcha, nice.

00:45:05.582 --> 00:45:07.841
MATT: Welcome to the live experience.
ASHLEY: Just to add to the full stress--

00:45:07.841 --> 00:45:09.220
MATT: Yeah.
MARISHA: Woo!

00:45:09.220 --> 00:45:10.053
ASHLEY: Of the thing.

00:45:10.053 --> 00:45:11.052
TRAVIS: We'll edit that out.

00:45:11.052 --> 00:45:11.885
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:45:11.885 --> 00:45:13.530
(laughter)

00:45:13.530 --> 00:45:14.363
MATT: Oops.

00:45:14.363 --> 00:45:16.533
TRAVIS: Don't fuck with electrical whirring things.

00:45:18.283 --> 00:45:21.283
MATT: So as you cast Armor of Agathys a second time

00:45:21.283 --> 00:45:22.223
at the next crystal,

00:45:22.223 --> 00:45:25.043
as the blood trickles down your face,

00:45:25.043 --> 00:45:27.863
that, too, breaks off and is pulled into the crystal.

00:45:27.863 --> 00:45:29.453
That glows, and then you watch

00:45:29.453 --> 00:45:32.073
as the route meets the secondary one.

00:45:32.073 --> 00:45:33.843
At this point you both, looking up,

00:45:33.843 --> 00:45:36.333
you can see something float by

00:45:36.333 --> 00:45:39.246
before it begins to descend rapidly in your direction.

00:45:40.315 --> 00:45:41.456
What do you do?
MARISHA: Did he follow us,

00:45:41.456 --> 00:45:43.201
that big golem thing?

00:45:43.201 --> 00:45:44.998
TRAVIS: I'm running. I'm running, I'm running to you.

00:45:44.998 --> 00:45:45.831
We need to get out of here.

00:45:45.831 --> 00:45:47.933
ASHLEY: Okay, okay. Come on, come on!
TRAVIS: That sphere, touch it.

00:45:47.933 --> 00:45:49.381
ASHLEY: Just ready to go, just in case.

00:45:49.381 --> 00:45:51.181
MARISHA: Backing up towards the pedestal.

00:45:51.181 --> 00:45:53.023
MATT: Okay, Fjord begins to approach

00:45:53.023 --> 00:45:56.963
right as it falls down to the ground

00:45:56.963 --> 00:45:58.773
and slams down onto its legs,

00:45:58.773 --> 00:45:59.633
the ground, the stone,

00:45:59.633 --> 00:46:02.363
seems to crack slightly under its weight.

00:46:02.363 --> 00:46:05.726
Go ahead and make a general dexterity check for me.

00:46:07.483 --> 00:46:08.888
TRAVIS: That's just mean.

00:46:08.888 --> 00:46:11.578
SAM: (vocalizing battle music)

00:46:11.578 --> 00:46:12.469
TRAVIS: Four.

00:46:12.469 --> 00:46:16.028
MATT: It drops and cuts you off from the other two.

00:46:16.028 --> 00:46:18.798
TRAVIS: Cool. That's fun.
ASHLEY: I scream out: Hey!

00:46:19.654 --> 00:46:20.829
Come here!

00:46:22.253 --> 00:46:23.703
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

00:46:31.033 --> 00:46:33.595
ASHLEY: Oh, minus two for intimidation, okay.

00:46:33.595 --> 00:46:34.713
MATT: You can use your strength for it.

00:46:34.713 --> 00:46:35.546
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.

00:46:35.546 --> 00:46:37.473
MATT: I'll say for purposes of that, it makes sense.

00:46:37.473 --> 00:46:38.843
ASHLEY: 13 total.

00:46:38.843 --> 00:46:40.303
MATT: 13 total.

00:46:40.303 --> 00:46:43.496
It stays locked onto Fjord.

00:46:44.853 --> 00:46:45.686
TRAVIS: That's okay.

00:46:45.686 --> 00:46:48.093
MATT: And I would like you all to roll initiative.

00:46:48.093 --> 00:46:50.516
We don't have to go into a battlefield for this.

00:46:50.516 --> 00:46:51.653
Since we only have three players,

00:46:51.653 --> 00:46:53.353
we're going to play this one more theater of the mind.

00:46:53.353 --> 00:46:55.394
MARISHA: Theater of the mind!

00:46:55.394 --> 00:46:56.652
TRAVIS: Hey, there's the natural 20.
SAM: This battlefield

00:46:56.652 --> 00:46:59.480
was not brought to you by Dwarven Forge.

00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:01.155
They had nothing to do with it.

00:47:01.155 --> 00:47:02.993
MATT: (chuckles)

00:47:02.993 --> 00:47:05.033
MARISHA: I'm going to use my boots.

00:47:05.033 --> 00:47:06.536
It's boots time.
MATT: Oh, wow.

00:47:08.503 --> 00:47:11.006
All right, so 25 to 20.

00:47:12.323 --> 00:47:15.024
MARISHA: Sorry, 22.

00:47:15.024 --> 00:47:16.220
TRAVIS: 20.

00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:17.366
MATT: Ooh, nice.

00:47:19.853 --> 00:47:21.113
ASHLEY: 18, sorry.

00:47:21.113 --> 00:47:22.558
MATT: Oh, wow, look at this.

00:47:22.558 --> 00:47:24.473
MARISHA: Hell yes.

00:47:24.473 --> 00:47:25.306
MATT: Okay.

00:47:26.433 --> 00:47:29.123
So as it now stands up after impacting the ground,

00:47:29.123 --> 00:47:30.493
rising its form,

00:47:30.493 --> 00:47:32.153
you can see where its forearms widen

00:47:32.153 --> 00:47:34.103
to these massive battering ram-like fists

00:47:34.103 --> 00:47:36.613
made of some sort of a hardened clay.

00:47:36.613 --> 00:47:37.773
Looking straight towards you,

00:47:37.773 --> 00:47:39.903
it has a somewhat featureless face

00:47:39.903 --> 00:47:41.251
other than a bump of a nose

00:47:41.251 --> 00:47:44.253
and these burning yellow eyes

00:47:44.253 --> 00:47:45.403
that are looking right towards you

00:47:45.403 --> 00:47:47.593
as it glances towards you.

00:47:47.593 --> 00:47:49.143
However, Beauregard, you're up first.

00:47:49.143 --> 00:47:50.203
What are you doing?

00:47:50.203 --> 00:47:51.973
MARISHA: My goodness gracious.

00:47:51.973 --> 00:47:54.925
Clay pipes ♪ are about to burst. ♪

00:47:54.925 --> 00:47:56.550
SAM: Great band: Clay Pipes.
TRAVIS: If this is some anti-magic shit,

00:47:56.550 --> 00:47:57.383
this could be bad.

00:47:59.672 --> 00:48:01.369
MARISHA: I feel like constructs can't be stunned,

00:48:01.369 --> 00:48:02.903
but I don't know if it is a construct.

00:48:02.903 --> 00:48:03.736
Okay, you know what?

00:48:03.736 --> 00:48:06.883
I'm going to run up and pop, pop,

00:48:06.883 --> 00:48:08.673
I'm going to take my staff out,

00:48:08.673 --> 00:48:11.583
and I'm going to go for the knees.

00:48:11.583 --> 00:48:13.003
MATT: Okay.

00:48:13.003 --> 00:48:14.469
MARISHA: Oh.

00:48:14.469 --> 00:48:17.163
TRAVIS: Run.
MARISHA: That was really bad.

00:48:17.163 --> 00:48:19.363
Run? I want to make sure you get by first.

00:48:19.363 --> 00:48:22.143
TRAVIS: I have jumping around shit for days.

00:48:22.143 --> 00:48:23.883
Run!

00:48:23.883 --> 00:48:26.773
MARISHA: Did I move? How much movement did I use?

00:48:26.773 --> 00:48:27.698
MATT: I'll say five feet,

00:48:27.698 --> 00:48:29.147
because you guys were waiting for Fjord--

00:48:29.147 --> 00:48:29.980
TRAVIS: Just go!
MATT: -- to get there, and it

00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:31.213
divided between the two of you.

00:48:31.213 --> 00:48:34.403
So you were backing up a little bit into the hallway.

00:48:34.403 --> 00:48:37.161
So it'd be about five feet to get back to where you were.

00:48:37.161 --> 00:48:40.086
MARISHA: Okay. First hit is--

00:48:41.886 --> 00:48:43.563
shit.

00:48:43.563 --> 00:48:44.833
18.

00:48:44.833 --> 00:48:45.903
MATT: 18 hits.

00:48:45.903 --> 00:48:46.926
MARISHA: Stunning Strike.

00:48:48.113 --> 00:48:49.113
MATT: Roll damage first.

00:48:50.066 --> 00:48:51.391
LAURA: (laughs)

00:48:51.391 --> 00:48:52.491
MARISHA: I guess.

00:48:53.491 --> 00:48:54.324
Okay.

00:48:56.529 --> 00:48:58.161
My brain. 12.

00:48:58.161 --> 00:49:01.036
MATT: 12 points of damage, all righty. Stunning strike.

00:49:02.873 --> 00:49:04.553
That is an eight.

00:49:04.553 --> 00:49:06.396
MARISHA: He is stunned.
MATT: Yes, he is.

00:49:07.593 --> 00:49:09.156
MARISHA: And then second damage.

00:49:11.293 --> 00:49:14.453
Great, nine damage.

00:49:14.453 --> 00:49:15.526
MATT: Nine damage, yeah.

00:49:16.633 --> 00:49:19.415
So as you pummel him twice from behind--

00:49:19.415 --> 00:49:20.853
TRAVIS: Okay!
MARISHA: Not too bad.

00:49:20.853 --> 00:49:22.943
(laughter)

00:49:22.943 --> 00:49:24.623
MATT: Your fist actually finds a portion

00:49:24.623 --> 00:49:26.003
of the hardened clay armor that cracks.

00:49:26.003 --> 00:49:26.836
As it breaks through,

00:49:26.836 --> 00:49:29.163
you hit something softer on the inside.

00:49:29.163 --> 00:49:30.853
And as it does, you watch from its side

00:49:30.853 --> 00:49:32.073
as it brings its fist back,

00:49:32.073 --> 00:49:34.723
locks up into place,

00:49:34.723 --> 00:49:36.103
and it's just holding position,

00:49:36.103 --> 00:49:38.133
the eyes, the energy flickering

00:49:38.133 --> 00:49:39.443
as it's not moving.

00:49:39.443 --> 00:49:41.303
MARISHA: Right in the sciatic nerve, okay.

00:49:41.303 --> 00:49:44.643
And I'm going to bolt to the thing.

00:49:44.643 --> 00:49:46.173
MATT: All right, as you see it locked up

00:49:46.173 --> 00:49:47.703
and freezing in place,

00:49:47.703 --> 00:49:49.143
you hear this slight whine sound,

00:49:49.143 --> 00:49:52.936
like this echoing (screeching whine) inside of it.

00:49:53.943 --> 00:49:57.023
You rush back and dart towards the far end of the chamber

00:49:57.023 --> 00:50:00.023
where the now brightly glowing sphere is.

00:50:00.023 --> 00:50:01.714
That finishes your go?
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:50:01.714 --> 00:50:04.283
How far away am I from the sphere now?

00:50:04.283 --> 00:50:05.703
MATT: Oh no, you are--

00:50:05.703 --> 00:50:07.773
It is a 60 foot tunnel, and you were--

00:50:07.773 --> 00:50:09.926
So you're almost there.
MARISHA: Okay.

00:50:10.923 --> 00:50:12.773
TRAVIS: I'll hear the whining sound,

00:50:12.773 --> 00:50:15.053
and it locked up in this position,

00:50:15.053 --> 00:50:18.413
and I will not do magic stuff and just--

00:50:19.693 --> 00:50:21.923
(laughter)

00:50:21.923 --> 00:50:23.563
TRAVIS: Walk around it

00:50:23.563 --> 00:50:25.793
and try and bolt physically,

00:50:25.793 --> 00:50:27.963
without using magic, past it.

00:50:27.963 --> 00:50:29.373
MATT: Okay.
ASHLEY: Nothing to see here.

00:50:29.373 --> 00:50:31.773
TRAVIS: Any swipes up my back?

00:50:31.773 --> 00:50:32.606
MATT: None.

00:50:32.606 --> 00:50:33.853
TRAVIS: Ooh, okay.

00:50:33.853 --> 00:50:37.608
I will double that and try and move all the way to the--

00:50:37.608 --> 00:50:38.441
MARISHA: Hell yes.

00:50:38.441 --> 00:50:40.743
TRAVIS: As far as I can for 60 total feet.

00:50:40.743 --> 00:50:42.333
MATT: Right, so you don't quite get there.

00:50:42.333 --> 00:50:43.523
You're about 10 feet away

00:50:43.523 --> 00:50:44.553
because you had to move around it

00:50:44.553 --> 00:50:45.593
and then go down the length

00:50:45.593 --> 00:50:48.280
of the 60-foot run to that point.

00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:50.180
MARISHA: But we're pretty close together now?

00:50:51.043 --> 00:50:52.403
MATT: Well, it comes to Yasha's turn.

00:50:52.403 --> 00:50:55.073
Yasha is right about there as well.

00:50:55.073 --> 00:50:57.043
So what are you doing for your turn?

00:50:57.043 --> 00:51:00.333
ASHLEY: I am going to slowly back up.

00:51:00.333 --> 00:51:02.695
Not slowly, fast rather.

00:51:02.695 --> 00:51:04.063
(laughter)

00:51:04.063 --> 00:51:06.876
ASHLEY: A fast backwards run, which doesn't make any sense.

00:51:06.876 --> 00:51:08.243
And just keeping my eye on him,

00:51:08.243 --> 00:51:10.443
and trying to get back to the sphere.

00:51:10.443 --> 00:51:11.651
MATT: Okay, cool.
SAM: Is that your gun?

00:51:11.651 --> 00:51:14.030
MATT: If you use your action and your movement--

00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:15.758
ASHLEY: That's the hilt of my sword.

00:51:15.758 --> 00:51:17.633
I know, that did look like--

00:51:17.633 --> 00:51:18.743
Yeah.

00:51:18.743 --> 00:51:20.106
MATT: Stay back!

00:51:20.106 --> 00:51:22.683
TRAVIS: It's tiny.
ASHLEY: (laughs)

00:51:22.683 --> 00:51:24.823
MATT: So yeah, if you use your action and your movement,

00:51:24.823 --> 00:51:25.878
you can get there without an issue.

00:51:25.878 --> 00:51:26.711
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:51:26.711 --> 00:51:27.544
MATT: So you rush over there,

00:51:27.544 --> 00:51:29.043
and you can see now

00:51:29.043 --> 00:51:31.203
this spherical placed-in crystal

00:51:31.203 --> 00:51:32.263
that matches the other ones,

00:51:32.263 --> 00:51:33.453
but is a bit larger and has a bunch

00:51:33.453 --> 00:51:34.903
of runes and signs around it.

00:51:36.893 --> 00:51:37.763
That's your turn.

00:51:37.763 --> 00:51:39.423
Is there anything else you want to do,

00:51:39.423 --> 00:51:40.704
or just wait for them?

00:51:41.954 --> 00:51:43.233
ASHLEY: I'mma rage just in case.

00:51:43.233 --> 00:51:44.303
MATT: Sure, go in there.

00:51:44.303 --> 00:51:45.983
Go to a waiting rage.

00:51:45.983 --> 00:51:47.753
TRAVIS: Go in there, go in that cave.

00:51:47.753 --> 00:51:48.630
ASHLEY: Yes.

00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:49.463
MATT: You got it.

00:51:49.463 --> 00:51:51.093
MARISHA: Raging in the cave.
TRAVIS: I like where you're at. Stay there.

00:51:51.093 --> 00:51:53.043
ASHLEY: Yeah, just in case.

00:51:53.043 --> 00:51:54.403
MATT: Okay.

00:51:54.403 --> 00:51:55.403
ASHLEY: Learned my lesson.

00:51:57.963 --> 00:51:59.492
MATT: The entity is stunned.

00:51:59.492 --> 00:52:03.083
So it stays there until the end of your next turn.

00:52:04.151 --> 00:52:04.984
Beauregard?

00:52:07.153 --> 00:52:08.363
MARISHA: All right, we ready?

00:52:08.363 --> 00:52:09.196
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:52:09.196 --> 00:52:11.243
MARISHA: Let's do the--
ASHLEY: We do the thing?

00:52:11.243 --> 00:52:12.453
Touch it again?

00:52:12.453 --> 00:52:13.513
TRAVIS: Yeah, the big, glowing sphere?

00:52:13.513 --> 00:52:14.533
Touch it, boof.

00:52:14.533 --> 00:52:15.366
MARISHA: Let's do it.

00:52:15.366 --> 00:52:16.373
I run up.
TRAVIS: Pop the pedestal.

00:52:16.373 --> 00:52:17.593
MARISHA: Touch the sphere.

00:52:17.593 --> 00:52:19.593
MATT: Beau just (whoosh)

00:52:20.583 --> 00:52:21.786
Appears to atomize.

00:52:23.693 --> 00:52:24.543
ASHLEY: No!
TRAVIS: Yep!

00:52:24.543 --> 00:52:26.325
ASHLEY: Go, let's go.
TRAVIS: Me, too.

00:52:26.325 --> 00:52:28.140
(laughter)

00:52:28.140 --> 00:52:32.016
MATT: (whooshing) The three of you vanish.

00:52:34.683 --> 00:52:36.971
And now we move to the other group.

00:52:36.971 --> 00:52:39.873
TRAVIS: Oh jesus, those pauses are killer.

00:52:39.873 --> 00:52:40.706
LAURA: How long was that?

00:52:40.706 --> 00:52:42.137
How long was that?

00:52:42.137 --> 00:52:43.030
TRAVIS: It was a while.

00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:44.008
LIAM: It felt like 45 minutes.

00:52:44.008 --> 00:52:46.304
LAURA: It was almost an hour.
LIAM: Almost an hour.

00:52:47.783 --> 00:52:49.025
MATT: We'll find out.
TALIESIN: We're level 15 now, right?

00:52:49.025 --> 00:52:51.033
SAM: Yeah.
(laughter)

00:52:51.033 --> 00:52:53.375
LIAM: I got four more eyes.

00:52:53.375 --> 00:52:54.758
TRAVIS: (laughs)

00:52:57.673 --> 00:52:58.673
MATT: The rest of you--

00:53:01.522 --> 00:53:02.355
LAURA: Oh no.

00:53:02.355 --> 00:53:03.188
SAM: Oh no.

00:53:04.693 --> 00:53:09.246
MATT: -- arrive in a shaded cavern,

00:53:10.413 --> 00:53:13.601
lit by numerous, nebulous sources of firelight.

00:53:14.673 --> 00:53:16.723
Glancing about, you see a tall, rocky ceiling

00:53:16.723 --> 00:53:19.723
that reaches above you, porous and black,

00:53:19.723 --> 00:53:22.283
as a number of chain lanterns hang

00:53:22.283 --> 00:53:25.216
to cast some additional light within the inside.

00:53:26.473 --> 00:53:28.803
The air smells of sulfur and charcoal,

00:53:28.803 --> 00:53:32.403
and it is uncomfortably hot in here.

00:53:32.403 --> 00:53:34.153
You immediately break into a sweat.

00:53:35.043 --> 00:53:37.803
As your eyes begin to adjust to the darkness in here

00:53:37.803 --> 00:53:39.843
with the bits of pinpoint light,

00:53:39.843 --> 00:53:42.333
you can see some of that glow in here,

00:53:42.333 --> 00:53:43.393
some of the source is,

00:53:43.393 --> 00:53:46.713
instead of just being a small fire or lantern,

00:53:46.713 --> 00:53:50.743
there is a pouring river of molten rock

00:53:50.743 --> 00:53:53.703
that is slowly snaking its way through the chamber.

00:53:53.703 --> 00:53:54.859
SAM: ♪ Snaking it's way ♪

00:53:54.859 --> 00:53:59.767
(laughter)

00:54:02.912 --> 00:54:04.775
TRAVIS: (laughs) What an asshole.

00:54:04.775 --> 00:54:07.893
(laughter)

00:54:07.893 --> 00:54:10.231
MATT: I take my 7d6 sneak attack damage.

00:54:10.231 --> 00:54:15.163
(laughter)

00:54:18.333 --> 00:54:22.763
MATT: And as you all take in this quiet surrounding

00:54:22.763 --> 00:54:24.016
in this space around you,

00:54:27.183 --> 00:54:31.383
Caleb and Caduceus,

00:54:31.383 --> 00:54:33.293
and Jester as well, I'd say,

00:54:33.293 --> 00:54:36.063
you can see elements of furniture

00:54:36.923 --> 00:54:38.473
not far from you.

00:54:38.473 --> 00:54:42.603
To your left, you can see some tables and a shelf unit

00:54:42.603 --> 00:54:46.053
and some scattering of instruments and a chair

00:54:46.913 --> 00:54:50.326
in the middle of this hellscape of a chamber,

00:54:52.423 --> 00:54:53.563
but here you are.

00:54:53.563 --> 00:54:56.163
LAURA: Does it look like old furniture,

00:54:56.163 --> 00:54:59.655
or does it look like it's in use?

00:54:59.655 --> 00:55:02.163
MATT: You can certainly go check if you'd like.

00:55:02.163 --> 00:55:04.913
LIAM: From our current vantage point,

00:55:04.913 --> 00:55:07.583
are there any tunnels out, doors out,

00:55:07.583 --> 00:55:10.563
any way out of the chamber that we're in that we can see?

00:55:10.563 --> 00:55:12.183
MATT: Make a perception check.
LIAM: Okay.

00:55:12.183 --> 00:55:13.422
LAURA: I'm going to just walk up.

00:55:13.422 --> 00:55:14.255
I'm not going to touch anything,

00:55:14.255 --> 00:55:17.910
I'm just going to look at the couch or whatever.

00:55:18.751 --> 00:55:19.584
LIAM: (lip pop)

00:55:19.584 --> 00:55:20.584
MATT: One?
LIAM: Yep.

00:55:21.533 --> 00:55:23.123
MATT: The light in here's a little dark,

00:55:23.123 --> 00:55:26.083
and there's a lot of odd tricks that it's playing on you

00:55:26.083 --> 00:55:30.274
with the variations between shadow and bright, burning rock.

00:55:31.113 --> 00:55:32.273
You probably have to take a little more time

00:55:32.273 --> 00:55:33.353
to figure that out.

00:55:33.353 --> 00:55:36.013
As you look into the furniture nearby,

00:55:36.013 --> 00:55:39.183
there is a faint dusting of soot across it,

00:55:39.183 --> 00:55:40.743
but it all is fairly made

00:55:40.743 --> 00:55:44.833
and looks like it's very well-crafted,

00:55:44.833 --> 00:55:47.996
was probably either made by some great artisan somewhere.

00:55:50.013 --> 00:55:52.253
SAM: Not giant size or anything?

00:55:52.253 --> 00:55:53.696
MATT: No, normal person size.

00:55:56.003 --> 00:55:59.635
You do see a cluster of notebooks

00:55:59.635 --> 00:56:01.423
on the base part of one of the shelves.

00:56:01.423 --> 00:56:02.963
And the shelves are mostly empty

00:56:02.963 --> 00:56:05.974
except for a handful of these notebooks piled in there.

00:56:05.974 --> 00:56:07.263
LAURA: Hop, hop, hop.

00:56:07.263 --> 00:56:09.493
Can I look at one of the notebooks?

00:56:09.493 --> 00:56:11.788
LIAM: Careful over there.
MATT: Sure.

00:56:13.743 --> 00:56:14.576
The first thing you notice

00:56:14.576 --> 00:56:16.423
as you pick it up and look through it,

00:56:16.423 --> 00:56:18.553
it's not made of normal paper.

00:56:18.553 --> 00:56:21.863
The pages in this are

00:56:21.863 --> 00:56:25.076
like a flexible, fireproof, enchanted silk.

00:56:25.076 --> 00:56:26.603
LAURA: Wow!

00:56:26.603 --> 00:56:27.803
MATT: And they're cold to the touch,

00:56:27.803 --> 00:56:29.653
unnaturally so versus everything else in this chamber,

00:56:29.653 --> 00:56:33.543
which has a very warm, almost hot temperature to it.

00:56:33.543 --> 00:56:35.083
Even as you get up off the ground,

00:56:35.083 --> 00:56:39.233
the ground almost burns your hands just touching it.

00:56:39.233 --> 00:56:40.743
And the air is thick and heavy.

00:56:40.743 --> 00:56:43.913
And even just breathing in here is a little uncomfortable.

00:56:43.913 --> 00:56:45.613
If you breathe in too much, too quickly,

00:56:45.613 --> 00:56:47.293
the heat begins to actually

00:56:47.293 --> 00:56:49.443
scald the inside of your lungs a little bit.

00:56:50.723 --> 00:56:52.073
What languages do you know?

00:56:53.883 --> 00:56:55.713
LAURA: Infernal and Common.

00:56:55.713 --> 00:56:57.373
MATT: Okay, what were you saying, Caduceus?

00:56:57.373 --> 00:56:59.483
TALIESIN: I was just going to throw a Detect Magic up,

00:56:59.483 --> 00:57:02.926
just to see if any of this stuff is do-not-touch.

00:57:05.003 --> 00:57:07.473
MATT: You don't recognize anything magical

00:57:07.473 --> 00:57:08.913
in this space here, necessarily.

00:57:08.913 --> 00:57:09.746
TALIESIN: Oh, okay.

00:57:11.323 --> 00:57:14.293
MATT: Maybe some faint elements of some of the instruments,

00:57:14.293 --> 00:57:15.660
but you haven't gotten a good look at them.

00:57:15.660 --> 00:57:17.693
And it's a faint aura on them.

00:57:17.693 --> 00:57:18.526
TALIESIN: All right.

00:57:21.818 --> 00:57:24.743
LAURA: I assume I don't understand any of the words.

00:57:24.743 --> 00:57:25.893
MATT: You do, actually.
LAURA: Oh!

00:57:25.893 --> 00:57:27.133
MATT: But we'll get to that in a moment

00:57:27.133 --> 00:57:28.823
because, right now, the rest of you

00:57:28.823 --> 00:57:31.433
are taking in the space.

00:57:31.433 --> 00:57:36.193
Marion is like, "So, where are we?"

00:57:36.193 --> 00:57:38.103
LIAM: Well, we don't exactly know.

00:57:38.103 --> 00:57:42.743
But the plan is, we are just going to check this area,

00:57:42.743 --> 00:57:43.576
make sure it's safe,

00:57:43.576 --> 00:57:47.923
and hopefully stay put until the others join us,

00:57:47.923 --> 00:57:49.073
and then we will leave.

00:57:50.598 --> 00:57:52.253
I don't know what your daughter is doing.

00:57:52.253 --> 00:57:53.433
But when she is done,

00:57:53.433 --> 00:57:56.473
I can throw up sort of a protective barrier for all of us,

00:57:56.473 --> 00:57:58.713
and we can spend most of our time in there.

00:57:58.713 --> 00:58:01.726
And it'll be far more comfortable than this is.

00:58:02.883 --> 00:58:03.813
LAURA: It's okay, Mama.

00:58:03.813 --> 00:58:08.453
I'm just looking to see if this says who owns this place.

00:58:08.453 --> 00:58:09.843
MATT: "Very well."

00:58:09.843 --> 00:58:13.098
You hear another voice go, (as Luc) "Whoa, cool."

00:58:13.098 --> 00:58:14.613
SAM: It is cool, it is cool.

00:58:14.613 --> 00:58:16.833
But this is a field trip

00:58:16.833 --> 00:58:20.453
like when you go to a museum and can't touch anything.

00:58:20.453 --> 00:58:22.713
So we should just look with our eyes,

00:58:22.713 --> 00:58:23.623
but not with our hands.

00:58:23.623 --> 00:58:25.193
MATT: "Is that lava?"

00:58:25.193 --> 00:58:27.373
SAM: It's real lava, yeah.

00:58:27.373 --> 00:58:30.295
Yeah, don't touch.
MATT: "No."

00:58:30.295 --> 00:58:31.386
SAM: No.

00:58:31.386 --> 00:58:33.143
MATT: Yeza grabs his shoulders from behind

00:58:33.143 --> 00:58:35.093
and just pulls him close.

00:58:35.093 --> 00:58:36.386
(as Yeza) "Honey?"
SAM: Uh-huh?

00:58:37.743 --> 00:58:39.163
MATT: "How long are we going to be here?"

00:58:39.163 --> 00:58:43.390
SAM: Well, a day, a night?

00:58:43.390 --> 00:58:45.243
We might have to spend the night here,

00:58:45.243 --> 00:58:48.383
but that's only so that the magic users can rest up.

00:58:48.383 --> 00:58:50.983
And then we'll be off to a much safer place.

00:58:50.983 --> 00:58:53.293
So far, pretty safe, though.

00:58:53.293 --> 00:58:54.985
Nobody's here, right?
MATT: "Right.

00:58:56.285 --> 00:58:57.601
"If, uh--

00:58:59.293 --> 00:59:01.953
"If you see anything strange, just let us know.

00:59:01.953 --> 00:59:03.994
"And if you

00:59:05.128 --> 00:59:08.343
"notice the damp parts of my trousers,

00:59:08.343 --> 00:59:09.835
"don't tell anyone."

00:59:11.078 --> 00:59:12.610
SAM: You know what, here.

00:59:12.610 --> 00:59:13.623
Here, take this.

00:59:13.623 --> 00:59:15.575
MATT: "It's actually drying off pretty quickly in here."

00:59:15.575 --> 00:59:17.063
SAM: Take this.
MATT: "This is beneficial."

00:59:17.063 --> 00:59:19.403
SAM: Take this scepter, just hold onto it for me.

00:59:19.403 --> 00:59:20.702
I don't need it right now.

00:59:20.702 --> 00:59:21.833
MATT: "Um?"

00:59:21.833 --> 00:59:24.583
SAM: Just hold onto it for a while, and it might--

00:59:24.583 --> 00:59:26.423
Just in case, just hold onto it

00:59:26.423 --> 00:59:28.173
and sort of get a feel for it

00:59:28.173 --> 00:59:31.383
for about an hour, just in case.

00:59:31.383 --> 00:59:32.216
MATT: "Okay.

00:59:34.023 --> 00:59:35.196
"All right."

00:59:36.562 --> 00:59:38.113
SAM: Yeah, protects you.

00:59:38.113 --> 00:59:40.573
TALIESIN: Is there anything moving on the horizon,

00:59:40.573 --> 00:59:42.823
anything strange?
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:59:44.837 --> 00:59:46.162
TALIESIN: Just rolled the one I can't read well

00:59:46.162 --> 00:59:47.188
because that's funny.

00:59:48.153 --> 00:59:50.063
16.

00:59:50.063 --> 00:59:54.073
MATT: 16. There are flickers of firelight

00:59:54.073 --> 00:59:56.921
dancing across the ceiling, refracting through them,

00:59:56.921 --> 01:00:01.273
that give variations in visibility in the chamber.

01:00:01.273 --> 01:00:04.223
There are rocks and boulders

01:00:04.223 --> 01:00:05.693
and elements that peak

01:00:05.693 --> 01:00:07.313
at different edges of the walls

01:00:07.313 --> 01:00:11.033
and some obscure elements of the lava flow

01:00:11.033 --> 01:00:12.423
in the far corner.

01:00:12.423 --> 01:00:13.693
And the lanterns themselves

01:00:13.693 --> 01:00:15.173
have a flickering to them as well.

01:00:15.173 --> 01:00:19.223
You do see across, either all the way

01:00:19.223 --> 01:00:21.103
around the southern exterior

01:00:21.103 --> 01:00:24.363
of where this pool seems to descend beneath the ground

01:00:24.363 --> 01:00:25.573
or across it directly,

01:00:25.573 --> 01:00:27.963
you can see an opening that progresses

01:00:27.963 --> 01:00:29.096
out of this chamber.

01:00:31.153 --> 01:00:31.986
TALIESIN: Huh.

01:00:36.293 --> 01:00:39.153
LIAM: So we can get out.

01:00:39.153 --> 01:00:40.206
Things can get in.

01:00:42.913 --> 01:00:43.746
TALIESIN: I mean.

01:00:44.646 --> 01:00:48.123
LIAM: How big is that passage that he found?

01:00:48.123 --> 01:00:50.283
MATT: It's about 10 feet across or so,

01:00:50.283 --> 01:00:52.513
and maybe about eight feet tall.

01:00:52.513 --> 01:00:54.053
It's not perfectly carved.

01:00:54.053 --> 01:00:56.003
It looks naturally formed

01:00:56.003 --> 01:00:57.223
like a lava tube of some kind,

01:00:57.223 --> 01:00:59.883
like air over time jettisoned out

01:00:59.883 --> 01:01:01.996
and created this escape.

01:01:03.943 --> 01:01:05.093
TALIESIN: I may have something.

01:01:05.963 --> 01:01:07.156
LIAM: I have ideas as well.

01:01:09.073 --> 01:01:10.773
MATT: Now while you're discussing that,

01:01:10.773 --> 01:01:12.573
you're looking through this element.

01:01:13.743 --> 01:01:15.303
It is written in Infernal.

01:01:15.303 --> 01:01:16.993
And even at just a quick glance,

01:01:16.993 --> 01:01:21.393
it talks a lot about connections between planes.

01:01:21.393 --> 01:01:25.393
It discusses the odd network

01:01:25.393 --> 01:01:29.576
of locations and overlapping realms,

01:01:29.576 --> 01:01:31.743
existences.

01:01:31.743 --> 01:01:36.603
It seems, as opposed to any long-form explanatory book,

01:01:36.603 --> 01:01:37.853
it is a bunch of notes.

01:01:37.853 --> 01:01:40.163
So it has a shorthand feel to it.

01:01:40.163 --> 01:01:42.633
You're having a hard time making sense of it all

01:01:42.633 --> 01:01:44.843
since it seems to be notes written to the reader

01:01:44.843 --> 01:01:48.416
for later conjecture.

01:01:50.563 --> 01:01:51.693
You can take more time and read it,

01:01:51.693 --> 01:01:53.243
but it'll take time to read it.

01:01:55.103 --> 01:01:57.011
LAURA: What are we doing?

01:01:57.011 --> 01:02:01.312
LIAM: We are just getting an idea of our safety here.

01:02:01.312 --> 01:02:03.143
Are you all right over there?

01:02:03.143 --> 01:02:04.526
LAURA: I'm okay, I'm just reading about

01:02:04.526 --> 01:02:06.523
all the different planes.

01:02:06.523 --> 01:02:08.583
I'm going to put down the Happy Fun Ball.

01:02:08.583 --> 01:02:11.433
I'm going to pull out my pen

01:02:11.433 --> 01:02:14.656
and start making additional notes in the notebook.

01:02:15.743 --> 01:02:17.085
MATT: Okay.
SAM: Just make sure the fun ball

01:02:17.085 --> 01:02:18.443
doesn't roll away or anything.

01:02:18.443 --> 01:02:19.276
LAURA: Yeah, I've got it.

01:02:19.276 --> 01:02:21.523
I'm standing, and the fun ball's between my feet.

01:02:21.523 --> 01:02:22.767
You know, when you hold it between your--

01:02:22.767 --> 01:02:24.376
SAM: Maybe put a rock or something.

01:02:24.376 --> 01:02:25.973
LAURA: I'm just holding it between my feet.

01:02:25.973 --> 01:02:27.953
MATT: Teleport out into the lava.

01:02:27.953 --> 01:02:30.122
TALIESIN: How big is this hallway opening?

01:02:30.122 --> 01:02:31.673
Is it standard door size?

01:02:31.673 --> 01:02:33.153
LIAM: Or is it tall, cavernous?

01:02:33.153 --> 01:02:35.087
MATT: Eight feet tall, about 10 feet wide.

01:02:35.087 --> 01:02:37.273
It's higher on one side than the other,

01:02:37.273 --> 01:02:38.743
so it's about seven foot on one

01:02:38.743 --> 01:02:39.713
and eight and a half on the other.

01:02:39.713 --> 01:02:41.233
It's lopsided and natural.

01:02:41.233 --> 01:02:43.723
TALIESIN: I could burn a lot of magic and seal it shut.

01:02:43.723 --> 01:02:47.783
LAURA: If I flip through the stuff,

01:02:47.783 --> 01:02:49.773
can I find specific planes?

01:02:49.773 --> 01:02:51.933
Is there a page dedicated to each plane?

01:02:51.933 --> 01:02:52.766
Or is it like--

01:02:52.766 --> 01:02:54.083
MATT: If you want to take-- I mean,

01:02:54.083 --> 01:02:57.963
flipping through, it's still investigation.

01:02:57.963 --> 01:02:59.233
If you want to roll an investigation check

01:02:59.233 --> 01:03:00.813
to see if you're looking for anything specific.

01:03:00.813 --> 01:03:02.973
LIAM: The dome's radius is high enough to block,

01:03:02.973 --> 01:03:03.812
to touch the ceiling.

01:03:03.812 --> 01:03:05.629
LAURA: Hey, Traveler, check this out. I'm Guiding.

01:03:09.668 --> 01:03:11.373
TALIESIN: So the dome would seal it anyway?

01:03:11.373 --> 01:03:12.763
LIAM: Yeah.

01:03:12.763 --> 01:03:16.083
TALIESIN: Do we wait for them to bamf out before dome?

01:03:16.083 --> 01:03:17.403
LAURA: 23.

01:03:17.403 --> 01:03:19.243
MATT: 23, okay.

01:03:19.243 --> 01:03:20.793
LAURA: Yeah, we definitely should.

01:03:22.763 --> 01:03:24.443
TALIESIN: I'd say put it up,

01:03:24.443 --> 01:03:26.476
and when they come out, they come out.

01:03:27.843 --> 01:03:29.373
LIAM: Dome is--

01:03:29.373 --> 01:03:30.633
I just need a little bit of time,

01:03:30.633 --> 01:03:34.633
but it's a pretty limitless resource if we're safe.

01:03:34.633 --> 01:03:38.196
TALIESIN: I will keep an eye in this direction.

01:03:39.293 --> 01:03:42.109
And if anything moves, I'll--

01:03:42.109 --> 01:03:43.753
I don't know what I'll do.

01:03:43.753 --> 01:03:45.147
LAURA: Just tell them Halas--

01:03:45.147 --> 01:03:46.592
Yussa sent us.

01:03:46.592 --> 01:03:49.083
Don't mention Halas.

01:03:49.083 --> 01:03:51.083
SAM: Should I go look outside the cavern,

01:03:51.083 --> 01:03:52.973
just to get a sense of where we are

01:03:52.973 --> 01:03:56.213
and if things are coming towards us or anything?

01:03:56.213 --> 01:03:57.593
LIAM: You can while I begin.

01:03:57.593 --> 01:04:01.463
I will walk over to where Caduceus is

01:04:01.463 --> 01:04:04.786
and first pat him on the back and say:

01:04:06.761 --> 01:04:10.053
I'm scared for us, but this was an excellent idea.

01:04:10.053 --> 01:04:11.719
TALIESIN: Thank you. It was kind of last minute.

01:04:11.719 --> 01:04:14.283
I'm already finding some breaks in my logic.

01:04:14.283 --> 01:04:15.183
But thank you.
LIAM: No, no.

01:04:15.183 --> 01:04:16.343
Don't sell yourself short.

01:04:16.343 --> 01:04:17.193
Thank you.

01:04:17.193 --> 01:04:19.193
And Caleb will sit and begin to--

01:04:19.193 --> 01:04:21.583
he pulls out his book and begins to ritual cast the dome

01:04:21.583 --> 01:04:22.763
where the chamber is.

01:04:22.763 --> 01:04:24.243
It has a radius of 10 feet.

01:04:24.243 --> 01:04:28.743
So if the archway of this cavern or passage

01:04:28.743 --> 01:04:29.883
is seven or eight feet,

01:04:29.883 --> 01:04:33.243
the dome could act like a cork in a bottle.

01:04:33.243 --> 01:04:36.893
And even if you take too long-- please don't take too long--

01:04:36.893 --> 01:04:38.833
you can still come back in.

01:04:38.833 --> 01:04:39.824
TALIESIN: Is anyone hurt, by the way?

01:04:39.824 --> 01:04:40.995
SAM: So you're going to do it now?

01:04:40.995 --> 01:04:41.878
LIAM: I will begin.

01:04:41.878 --> 01:04:43.573
It's going to take me 10 or 11 minutes.

01:04:44.593 --> 01:04:46.023
SAM: Why don't I just go peek out

01:04:46.023 --> 01:04:48.773
and get a sense of where we are

01:04:48.773 --> 01:04:51.183
or if we're in immediate danger or anything?

01:04:51.183 --> 01:04:52.853
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>, be careful.
SAM: Okay.

01:04:52.853 --> 01:04:54.315
LAURA: We're not in immediate danger.

01:04:54.315 --> 01:04:55.515
Everything's fine, Mama.

01:04:56.803 --> 01:04:59.348
MATT: "This certainly feels like immediate danger."

01:04:59.348 --> 01:05:00.733
LAURA: No, no, no, no.

01:05:00.733 --> 01:05:03.183
We're just visiting somebody's house, that's all.

01:05:05.313 --> 01:05:07.133
SAM: They left the heat on.

01:05:07.133 --> 01:05:08.273
It's fine.

01:05:08.273 --> 01:05:09.383
TALIESIN: Guidance or Resistance?

01:05:09.383 --> 01:05:10.283
I'm trying to decide.

01:05:10.283 --> 01:05:11.952
Do you want to be safe from things,

01:05:11.952 --> 01:05:12.973
or do you want to be better at things?

01:05:12.973 --> 01:05:14.213
SAM: Better.

01:05:14.213 --> 01:05:15.046
TALIESIN: Guidance it is.

01:05:15.046 --> 01:05:16.433
SAM: Okay.

01:05:16.433 --> 01:05:20.506
So I'll sneak, sneak and stealth, stealth and sneak.

01:05:21.668 --> 01:05:23.273
TALIESIN: I give Veth a little--

01:05:23.273 --> 01:05:25.073
LAURA: I would, but I'm in the middle

01:05:25.073 --> 01:05:26.235
of perception checking--
TALIESIN: Doing things, oh.

01:05:26.235 --> 01:05:28.232
LAURA: I wouldn't be--
TALIESIN: Never mind. Carry on.

01:05:28.232 --> 01:05:30.115
SAM: I'm going to just go over to the mouth of the cave,

01:05:30.115 --> 01:05:33.203
Matthew, and just peek out stealthily.

01:05:33.203 --> 01:05:35.686
MATT: All right. Well, go ahead and roll stealth check to--

01:05:38.313 --> 01:05:39.146
SAM: 30.

01:05:40.653 --> 01:05:41.633
MATT: Okay.

01:05:41.633 --> 01:05:43.313
That's pretty stealthy.

01:05:43.313 --> 01:05:45.756
As you make your way through the tunnel,

01:05:47.933 --> 01:05:49.941
it is fairly lightless

01:05:49.941 --> 01:05:54.415
for about 120 or so feet.

01:05:54.415 --> 01:05:55.598
SAM: Oh, that's long.

01:05:55.598 --> 01:05:59.988
MATT: It curls, waves back and forth.

01:06:01.333 --> 01:06:02.733
You're lost in the darkness at this point.

01:06:02.733 --> 01:06:03.938
You're having to feel your way around.

01:06:03.938 --> 01:06:06.081
SAM: So there's no mouth of it?

01:06:07.779 --> 01:06:09.183
MATT: Of this tunnel, not yet.

01:06:09.183 --> 01:06:10.163
SAM: Oh, it just keeps going.

01:06:10.163 --> 01:06:12.213
MATT: It just keeps going for the time being.

01:06:12.213 --> 01:06:13.046
LAURA: Oh.

01:06:14.003 --> 01:06:14.836
MATT: Do you keep going?

01:06:14.836 --> 01:06:16.413
SAM: No, (laughs) no.

01:06:16.413 --> 01:06:19.201
Once I get about 120 feet, I'll turn back.

01:06:19.201 --> 01:06:20.543
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:06:20.543 --> 01:06:22.763
SAM: Oh boy.
MATT: With disadvantage.

01:06:22.763 --> 01:06:25.173
SAM: Disadvantage.
MATT: Because you're in pitch black.

01:06:25.173 --> 01:06:26.681
TALIESIN: You can add a d4 to it.

01:06:26.681 --> 01:06:27.514
SAM: Oh.

01:06:31.693 --> 01:06:32.706
Pretty good.

01:06:33.571 --> 01:06:34.746
19.

01:06:36.443 --> 01:06:37.556
For me, that's good.

01:06:40.573 --> 01:06:41.833
MATT: It's been fairly dark,

01:06:41.833 --> 01:06:43.283
and that fear is creeping into your mind

01:06:43.283 --> 01:06:45.600
of, "This could be an endless oubliette

01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:47.790
"of lightless death,

01:06:47.790 --> 01:06:49.353
"and I could just vanish on my own."

01:06:49.353 --> 01:06:50.553
And right as that thought hits you,

01:06:50.553 --> 01:06:54.013
you can see just the very faintest bit of light

01:06:54.013 --> 01:06:55.483
reflecting off the far wall

01:06:55.483 --> 01:06:57.213
before it curves around the corner,

01:06:57.213 --> 01:07:00.161
the first change you've seen in this black expanse.

01:07:00.161 --> 01:07:01.313
LAURA: Don't trust it.

01:07:01.313 --> 01:07:02.146
Don't trust it.

01:07:02.146 --> 01:07:05.043
It's like-- did you ever see The Descent,

01:07:05.043 --> 01:07:06.733
where it feels like you see a light,

01:07:06.733 --> 01:07:07.793
but then you're in a cavern,

01:07:07.793 --> 01:07:09.253
and it's a trick of your eyes,

01:07:09.253 --> 01:07:11.303
and then you end up trapped down forever?

01:07:11.303 --> 01:07:13.203
SAM: You know what?
LIAM: Thanks, little boy.

01:07:13.203 --> 01:07:15.523
SAM: I never saw The Descent, so I'll keep going.

01:07:15.523 --> 01:07:17.427
MATT: Okay.

01:07:17.427 --> 01:07:18.787
MARISHA: It's so good.
ASHLEY and TALIESIN: It's really good.

01:07:18.787 --> 01:07:19.620
MARISHA: You've got to watch it.

01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:20.461
SAM: I'll just peek around.

01:07:20.461 --> 01:07:22.503
MATT: Original UK version, not the shitty American ending.

01:07:22.503 --> 01:07:23.870
MARISHA: Watch the British version.

01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:25.661
LIAM: Watch The Descent.

01:07:25.661 --> 01:07:26.494
MATT: Yeah.

01:07:28.123 --> 01:07:29.583
You continue down this tunnel,

01:07:29.583 --> 01:07:32.216
and the light gets brighter and brighter.

01:07:33.073 --> 01:07:35.763
And then eventually you see an end, an opening,

01:07:35.763 --> 01:07:38.306
an orange-ish haze beyond it.

01:07:40.293 --> 01:07:45.043
SAM: Like the cave, the tunnel ends in just pure orange?

01:07:45.043 --> 01:07:46.559
Or it opens out to something?

01:07:46.559 --> 01:07:47.989
MATT: It ends,

01:07:47.989 --> 01:07:49.573
and just at this distance,

01:07:49.573 --> 01:07:50.863
you see just an orange haze.

01:07:50.863 --> 01:07:52.193
You'd have to walk to the end

01:07:52.193 --> 01:07:54.646
to really look out to where it's going.

01:07:55.483 --> 01:07:56.766
SAM: Boy, that's dangerous.

01:07:59.013 --> 01:08:01.233
I have to walk out of the cave to see?

01:08:01.233 --> 01:08:02.942
MATT: Or much closer to the entrance.

01:08:02.942 --> 01:08:04.843
SAM: How far from me?

01:08:04.843 --> 01:08:07.123
MATT: Say 40, 50 feet.

01:08:07.123 --> 01:08:08.353
SAM: Oh my god, it's so far.

01:08:08.353 --> 01:08:10.883
That's so fucking far. (laughs)

01:08:10.883 --> 01:08:12.846
I'm like 200 feet away from these people now.

01:08:12.846 --> 01:08:14.468
TRAVIS: I feel like someone in this campaign

01:08:14.468 --> 01:08:16.668
stepped out and got instantly squished

01:08:17.641 --> 01:08:19.698
in one of these scenarios before.
LAURA: Hmm, who was it?

01:08:19.698 --> 01:08:20.684
SAM: I don't remember.

01:08:20.684 --> 01:08:23.494
MARISHA: I don't know. It happened so quick.
TRAVIS: Smaller character, smaller.

01:08:23.494 --> 01:08:25.252
MARISHA: Barely remember his name.

01:08:25.252 --> 01:08:26.381
Splat?

01:08:26.381 --> 01:08:27.214
Splurt.

01:08:30.053 --> 01:08:32.873
SAM: I will turn around and go back.

01:08:32.873 --> 01:08:33.706
MATT: Okay.

01:08:34.633 --> 01:08:36.233
You trace your way back.
SAM: Yes.

01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:39.107
Hey, hey.

01:08:39.107 --> 01:08:42.193
There's an end to this tunnel.

01:08:42.193 --> 01:08:43.151
LIAM: Okay, okay.

01:08:43.151 --> 01:08:44.101
SAM: It's 200 feet away.

01:08:44.101 --> 01:08:45.813
I'm not really good in the dark.

01:08:45.813 --> 01:08:48.463
I think I should use the buddy system.

01:08:48.463 --> 01:08:49.640
There's no traps or anything.

01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:51.220
Does someone want to come and just check it out

01:08:51.220 --> 01:08:52.993
with me one more time?

01:08:52.993 --> 01:08:54.723
LAURA: I'll come with you as soon as I get done looking

01:08:54.723 --> 01:08:56.260
at this journal that I'm busy looking at.

01:08:56.260 --> 01:08:57.583
SAM: Oh, okay.

01:08:57.583 --> 01:08:58.954
Seems weird, but sure.

01:09:00.045 --> 01:09:02.083
Hey, have you ever seen "The Descent"?

01:09:02.083 --> 01:09:04.458
LAURA: Oh my gosh, it's so scary.

01:09:04.458 --> 01:09:05.291
SAM: I haven't.

01:09:05.291 --> 01:09:08.189
LAURA: Super claustrophobic.
SAM: Anyway, what'd you find?

01:09:08.189 --> 01:09:10.273
LAURA: I don't know.

01:09:10.273 --> 01:09:11.736
I rolled a 23, though.

01:09:13.563 --> 01:09:14.403
MATT: You did.

01:09:14.403 --> 01:09:17.246
And as you're glancing through,

01:09:19.693 --> 01:09:22.683
there are maps of the cosmic planes

01:09:22.683 --> 01:09:24.803
meshed with equations half built

01:09:24.803 --> 01:09:26.493
that you don't really understand,

01:09:26.493 --> 01:09:27.653
small notes in the margins

01:09:27.653 --> 01:09:31.073
about people and places within each of these locations,

01:09:31.073 --> 01:09:33.996
pontification on balance an imbalance between them.

01:09:35.407 --> 01:09:36.473
LAURA: Oh, I'm going to write,

01:09:36.473 --> 01:09:38.653
"This plane made me have to poop."

01:09:38.653 --> 01:09:41.203
MATT: There you go.
TRAVIS: (laughs)

01:09:41.203 --> 01:09:42.915
MATT: Make a dexterity check for me.

01:09:42.915 --> 01:09:44.434
LAURA: (laughs) What?

01:09:44.434 --> 01:09:47.246
LIAM: This world was a gift.

01:09:47.246 --> 01:09:49.783
This is an Airbnb in hell or wherever.

01:09:49.783 --> 01:09:51.003
MARISHA: Or a fire plane or something.

01:09:51.003 --> 01:09:51.994
LAURA: Nine.

01:09:53.773 --> 01:09:56.653
MATT: You're having a hard time matching this handwriting.

01:09:56.653 --> 01:09:57.486
LAURA: That's okay.

01:09:57.486 --> 01:10:00.543
MATT: But it gets the point across.
LAURA: Yeah. (laughs)

01:10:00.543 --> 01:10:02.923
MATT: The theories on a pattern of change

01:10:02.923 --> 01:10:05.093
begin to peek through in some of the notes.

01:10:05.093 --> 01:10:08.613
A slow shift in the structure between the planes,

01:10:08.613 --> 01:10:10.303
and a possible sudden shift

01:10:10.303 --> 01:10:12.523
in the cosmic tapestry down the road.

01:10:12.523 --> 01:10:13.703
And you can see a lot of these notes,

01:10:13.703 --> 01:10:16.173
there's a combination of worry and excitement

01:10:16.173 --> 01:10:17.513
gleaned from them.

01:10:17.513 --> 01:10:19.883
This person is just pontificating

01:10:19.883 --> 01:10:23.113
about possible cosmic events down the road

01:10:23.113 --> 01:10:25.023
that could be catastrophic

01:10:25.023 --> 01:10:27.513
or very exciting and unique,

01:10:27.513 --> 01:10:28.866
remaking of the cosmos.

01:10:31.103 --> 01:10:32.403
But they're all theories.

01:10:32.403 --> 01:10:33.236
LAURA: Okay.

01:10:34.082 --> 01:10:35.765
Hey, Caleb?
LIAM: Yes?

01:10:35.765 --> 01:10:38.223
LAURA: When you get done-- oh, can you read Infernal?

01:10:38.223 --> 01:10:39.873
Oh, you can if you give it some time.

01:10:39.873 --> 01:10:41.063
When you get done with your dome,

01:10:41.063 --> 01:10:42.423
you should totally look at this book

01:10:42.423 --> 01:10:43.598
because I think you would really like it.

01:10:43.598 --> 01:10:45.143
It's about all these different planes

01:10:45.143 --> 01:10:46.561
and mathematical equations.

01:10:46.561 --> 01:10:47.511
LIAM: I'm about to lose my place.

01:10:47.511 --> 01:10:49.552
LAURA: No, no, oh. Just keep working, then.
LIAM: Okay.

01:10:50.513 --> 01:10:52.593
LAURA: Don't let me distract you.

01:10:52.593 --> 01:10:53.933
LIAM: You're not very distracting.

01:10:53.933 --> 01:10:55.316
LAURA: Okay.

01:10:55.316 --> 01:10:57.149
So it's about astral planes

01:10:57.149 --> 01:10:59.513
and like different kinds of cosmic lineups,

01:10:59.513 --> 01:11:00.346
and stuff like that.

01:11:00.346 --> 01:11:01.823
It's really-- anyway, I'm just going to put it

01:11:01.823 --> 01:11:03.033
right next to you.

01:11:03.033 --> 01:11:05.133
I'm going to go sneak down the tunnel with Veth.

01:11:05.133 --> 01:11:08.143
So if you need anything, we'll just be really close.

01:11:08.143 --> 01:11:08.976
Okay.

01:11:13.295 --> 01:11:15.513
(laughter)

01:11:15.513 --> 01:11:17.403
MATT: So you finished thumbing through?

01:11:17.403 --> 01:11:18.713
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

01:11:18.713 --> 01:11:21.163
LAURA: I figured Caleb probably knows better

01:11:21.163 --> 01:11:22.533
than I do on that stuff.

01:11:22.533 --> 01:11:24.143
MATT: Okay.

01:11:24.143 --> 01:11:25.093
What do you do now?

01:11:25.942 --> 01:11:27.543
SAM: Want to come investigate with me?

01:11:27.543 --> 01:11:28.376
LAURA: Yeah.

01:11:28.376 --> 01:11:32.563
SAM: Okay, but I got a little lost
on the way, so I don't know.

01:11:32.563 --> 01:11:34.603
LAURA: It's like a straight line.

01:11:34.603 --> 01:11:37.143
SAM: Well, it winds a little, it's dark,

01:11:37.143 --> 01:11:38.776
I can't see in the dark.

01:11:39.973 --> 01:11:41.153
LAURA: Okay.

01:11:41.153 --> 01:11:42.223
SAM: I'm going to hold your hand.

01:11:42.223 --> 01:11:43.373
LAURA: Okay, hold my hand, but just know

01:11:43.373 --> 01:11:45.733
I'm, like, almost completely useless right now.

01:11:45.733 --> 01:11:47.044
SAM: You can see in the dark, right?

01:11:47.044 --> 01:11:48.526
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: That's all I need.

01:11:48.526 --> 01:11:49.413
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: Okay.

01:11:49.413 --> 01:11:50.246
LAURA: Oh, Caleb!

01:11:50.246 --> 01:11:52.373
If you find anything about the Fey realm or anything,

01:11:52.373 --> 01:11:53.743
when you're looking at the different planes,

01:11:53.743 --> 01:11:55.383
let me know, because I would love to know more

01:11:55.383 --> 01:11:57.223
about the Fey realm or the astral plane,

01:11:57.223 --> 01:11:58.503
I think that's a really important one.

01:11:58.503 --> 01:12:00.756
LIAM: Fey realm, astral plane, carry the two,

01:12:01.773 --> 01:12:05.143
radius is 8.5 feet.

01:12:05.143 --> 01:12:06.193
Do you want my Driftglobe?

01:12:06.193 --> 01:12:07.406
Shit, I'm starting over.

01:12:07.406 --> 01:12:08.453
(laughter)

01:12:08.453 --> 01:12:09.603
SAM: What's a Driftglobe?

01:12:09.603 --> 01:12:11.563
TALIESIN: So you want the Driftglobe.

01:12:11.563 --> 01:12:12.643
LIAM: It floats, it's light.

01:12:12.643 --> 01:12:13.476
SAM: You have it?

01:12:13.476 --> 01:12:14.473
TALIESIN: Yes.
LIAM: Yeah.

01:12:14.473 --> 01:12:16.793
SAM: It wasn't stolen with all our other stuff?

01:12:16.793 --> 01:12:18.252
LIAM: No, I carry it on my person at all times.

01:12:18.252 --> 01:12:19.363
SAM: Great, I'll take it.

01:12:19.363 --> 01:12:22.030
LIAM: Careful, don't--

01:12:22.030 --> 01:12:24.505
You can just do light or you can do daylight.

01:12:24.505 --> 01:12:26.171
We don't want daylight.
SAM: I don't want daylight.

01:12:26.171 --> 01:12:28.086
TALIESIN: You're both healed up, right, you're good?

01:12:28.086 --> 01:12:29.586
LAURA: I'm good.
LIAM: I'm okay.

01:12:29.586 --> 01:12:31.110
TALIESIN: Are you sure you don't-- want a little kick?

01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:32.483
Want a little kick?

01:12:32.483 --> 01:12:33.453
SAM: I'm okay, probably.

01:12:33.453 --> 01:12:35.663
TALIESIN: Okay, one more, one more, one more.

01:12:35.663 --> 01:12:36.674
SAM: Thank you.

01:12:36.674 --> 01:12:37.663
TALIESIN: There you go.

01:12:37.663 --> 01:12:38.496
MATT: Okay.

01:12:38.496 --> 01:12:40.063
While you guys are going into the tunnel, Caduceus,

01:12:40.063 --> 01:12:40.896
what're you doing?

01:12:40.896 --> 01:12:43.843
TALIESIN: I'm just keeping an eye out while Caleb--

01:12:43.843 --> 01:12:46.633
I'm keeping an eye out for anything suspicious.

01:12:46.633 --> 01:12:48.046
This place is weird.

01:12:49.043 --> 01:12:49.876
MATT: Okay.

01:12:50.823 --> 01:12:53.156
As you're sitting there keeping an eye out,

01:12:54.113 --> 01:12:55.980
little Luc creeps up next to you,

01:12:55.980 --> 01:12:57.680
and follows your eye line.

01:13:00.843 --> 01:13:02.043
TALIESIN: See anything?

01:13:03.813 --> 01:13:04.646
MATT: "Yeah."

01:13:04.646 --> 01:13:05.493
TALIESIN: What do you see?

01:13:06.493 --> 01:13:08.353
MATT: "I dunno."

01:13:08.353 --> 01:13:10.636
TALIESIN: Me neither, it's worrisome.

01:13:11.523 --> 01:13:12.356
MATT: "Yeah."

01:13:12.356 --> 01:13:13.313
TALIESIN: What do you smell?

01:13:15.233 --> 01:13:16.490
MATT: "It smells like farts."

01:13:16.490 --> 01:13:19.886
(laughter)

01:13:19.886 --> 01:13:20.719
TALIESIN: It does.

01:13:20.719 --> 01:13:22.123
TRAVIS: (laughs)

01:13:22.123 --> 01:13:23.389
MATT: "Is that you?"

01:13:24.392 --> 01:13:26.430
TALIESIN: I mean probably, yeah.

01:13:26.430 --> 01:13:27.321
MATT: "Cool."

01:13:27.321 --> 01:13:28.578
TALIESIN: Yeah. Thank you.

01:13:28.578 --> 01:13:30.286
(laughter)

01:13:30.286 --> 01:13:31.903
MATT: "I like your face."

01:13:31.903 --> 01:13:32.963
TALIESIN: Oh, thank you.

01:13:32.963 --> 01:13:34.453
I like how tall you are.

01:13:34.453 --> 01:13:35.561
It's nice.

01:13:39.043 --> 01:13:40.303
What do you hear?

01:13:42.513 --> 01:13:43.604
MATT: "Farts."

01:13:43.604 --> 01:13:45.883
(laughter)

01:13:45.883 --> 01:13:49.031
TALIESIN: Try and just listen for
one at a time, that's the trick.

01:13:49.031 --> 01:13:50.647
LAURA: (laughs)

01:13:53.833 --> 01:13:55.088
I gently let one go.

01:13:55.088 --> 01:13:57.971
(laughter)

01:13:57.971 --> 01:14:00.189
MATT: He starts laughing.
(laughter)

01:14:00.189 --> 01:14:01.360
SAM: Uncle Duce-y.
TALIESIN: Don't go far.

01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:03.788
ASHLEY: Gently.
TALIESIN: Gently.

01:14:03.788 --> 01:14:04.796
TRAVIS: Don't force it.

01:14:04.796 --> 01:14:06.394
(laughter)

01:14:06.394 --> 01:14:07.500
LIAM: Just like--
TALIESIN: Like playing the flute.

01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:09.023
LIAM: Barely shivering queef.
TALIESIN: Can't blow too hard.

01:14:09.023 --> 01:14:11.393
(laughter)

01:14:11.393 --> 01:14:13.183
MATT: All righty, now, as the two of you make your way

01:14:13.183 --> 01:14:14.899
down the tunnel--
LIAM: ♪ Makin' my way ♪

01:14:14.899 --> 01:14:16.823
LAURA: We're sneaking.
SAM: We're sneaking.

01:14:16.823 --> 01:14:18.443
MATT: Stealth check on both of you, then, please.

01:14:18.443 --> 01:14:22.153
LAURA: Okay, and also, I'm going to Guide myself.

01:14:22.153 --> 01:14:24.193
I'm going to Guide-- oh, wait.

01:14:24.193 --> 01:14:26.063
Can I Blessing of the Trickster-- you don't need it,

01:14:26.063 --> 01:14:27.203
you've got advantage anyway.

01:14:27.203 --> 01:14:29.253
SAM: I'm okay.
LAURA: I'm going to Guide myself.

01:14:30.113 --> 01:14:31.343
MATT: Okay.

01:14:31.343 --> 01:14:32.633
TALIESIN: You've got Guidance.

01:14:32.633 --> 01:14:33.466
SAM: I do.

01:14:36.163 --> 01:14:37.188
32.

01:14:39.673 --> 01:14:40.633
LAURA: 19.

01:14:40.633 --> 01:14:43.003
MATT: Okay, you quietly make your way

01:14:43.003 --> 01:14:44.603
towards the edge of this tunnel.

01:14:44.603 --> 01:14:46.193
You're not using the Driftglobe at the moment, right?

01:14:46.193 --> 01:14:47.343
SAM: No.
MATT: Because that would break the stealth.

01:14:47.343 --> 01:14:49.471
SAM: That seems foolhardy.

01:14:49.471 --> 01:14:52.603
MATT: As you approach the opening, the mouth of this,

01:14:52.603 --> 01:14:54.469
you begin to...

01:14:55.853 --> 01:14:58.069
carefully crystallize your vision on

01:14:58.069 --> 01:14:59.433
what was just this orange haze.

01:14:59.433 --> 01:15:01.483
As you look out into this...

01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:04.816
endless badlands

01:15:04.816 --> 01:15:09.386
of broken, burning land and black rock,

01:15:10.273 --> 01:15:13.333
distant mountains that are set aflame,

01:15:13.333 --> 01:15:16.945
the sky horizon that is burning orange and red.

01:15:16.945 --> 01:15:18.973
You can see distant tornadoes of flame,

01:15:18.973 --> 01:15:21.623
just tearing through the landscape

01:15:21.623 --> 01:15:23.883
and jutting bits of glass, like rock

01:15:23.883 --> 01:15:26.973
that seems to be poking from beneath the ground

01:15:26.973 --> 01:15:31.903
and causing these beautiful, if dangerous, jagged gardens

01:15:33.283 --> 01:15:34.929
of melted sand.

01:15:35.823 --> 01:15:37.443
On the far, far distant horizons,

01:15:37.443 --> 01:15:39.606
you can see black clouds of ash,

01:15:40.463 --> 01:15:42.423
and the temperature on the inside of the tunnel is hot.

01:15:42.423 --> 01:15:45.123
It is even hotter outside.

01:15:45.123 --> 01:15:47.253
Even just inhaling causes you to cough

01:15:47.253 --> 01:15:49.468
a little bit from the heat.

01:15:49.468 --> 01:15:50.653
LAURA: (coughs)

01:15:51.503 --> 01:15:53.066
SAM: Any signs of life out there?

01:15:54.233 --> 01:15:56.043
MATT: Not in the sense that you're used to.

01:15:56.043 --> 01:15:57.173
There's a lot of things moving around,

01:15:57.173 --> 01:16:00.993
but it all appears to be strangely weather patterns,

01:16:00.993 --> 01:16:05.221
and fire, and clouds, and dust.

01:16:05.221 --> 01:16:06.518
LAURA: This is awful.

01:16:06.518 --> 01:16:08.099
SAM: Yeah, this place sucks.

01:16:08.099 --> 01:16:09.086
LAURA: Yeah.

01:16:09.086 --> 01:16:12.783
SAM: Just so-- along the immediate sort of area

01:16:12.783 --> 01:16:15.823
of like where someone might walk into the cave,

01:16:15.823 --> 01:16:19.943
is there any signs of footprints or tracks of any kind?

01:16:19.943 --> 01:16:22.174
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception or investigation check.

01:16:22.174 --> 01:16:24.743
LAURA: Ooh, can I give you advantage?

01:16:24.743 --> 01:16:25.933
Because, can I help?

01:16:25.933 --> 01:16:27.882
MATT: Sure, definitely.
SAM: Can she just roll?

01:16:27.882 --> 01:16:30.655
LAURA: No, no, you do it, you double double.

01:16:30.655 --> 01:16:33.423
SAM: Investigation? Natural 20.

01:16:33.423 --> 01:16:34.896
MATT: Damn, for a total of--?

01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:40.961
SAM: If I use Caduceus' whatever, that's...

01:16:42.336 --> 01:16:43.294
35.

01:16:44.238 --> 01:16:45.479
TRAVIS: Jesus.

01:16:45.479 --> 01:16:49.233
MATT: You do see footprints, you see a number of sets

01:16:49.233 --> 01:16:50.999
of footprints that are--

01:16:52.499 --> 01:16:54.474
that would be faded,

01:16:54.474 --> 01:16:56.583
leading just outside of the cave,

01:16:56.583 --> 01:16:59.703
and once they begin to open to the ashy exterior,

01:16:59.703 --> 01:17:02.523
they are buried, just a bunch of soot and dust

01:17:02.523 --> 01:17:05.053
has filled it, but you see all manner of

01:17:05.053 --> 01:17:07.473
humanoid footprints going in and out.

01:17:07.473 --> 01:17:09.663
SAM: I can't tell how old they are?

01:17:09.663 --> 01:17:11.413
MATT: With that roll? Yeah, you would.

01:17:12.953 --> 01:17:16.031
Probably a year or more.

01:17:16.031 --> 01:17:17.548
You gather.
LAURA: Wow.

01:17:18.739 --> 01:17:21.405
I just kneel down next to Veth,

01:17:21.405 --> 01:17:23.110
and like look at her and say:

01:17:23.110 --> 01:17:24.583
You're really good at that.

01:17:24.583 --> 01:17:28.323
SAM: The light is just perfect, it's this orange glow.

01:17:28.323 --> 01:17:29.353
I can see everything right.

01:17:29.353 --> 01:17:31.753
LAURA: You should seriously, like, if we save the world

01:17:31.753 --> 01:17:33.783
and we end up not dying over everything,

01:17:33.783 --> 01:17:35.213
and Yeza's okay with it,

01:17:35.213 --> 01:17:37.223
we should seriously think about opening up

01:17:37.223 --> 01:17:38.803
a detective agency.

01:17:38.803 --> 01:17:41.183
SAM: I've thought about that a lot, actually.

01:17:41.183 --> 01:17:42.424
LAURA: Right?
SAM: Yes.

01:17:42.424 --> 01:17:45.799
I have some other ideas, but yes,

01:17:45.799 --> 01:17:47.053
that sounds--

01:17:47.053 --> 01:17:48.543
We could crack some case.

01:17:48.543 --> 01:17:50.393
LAURA: I mean, you're a natural.

01:17:50.393 --> 01:17:55.381
SAM: Your instincts are second to none.

01:17:55.381 --> 01:17:56.329
LAURA: Thank you so much.

01:17:56.329 --> 01:17:57.479
SAM: <i>And</i> we're a good team,

01:17:57.479 --> 01:18:00.513
because you can, when we have to interrogate someone--

01:18:00.513 --> 01:18:02.180
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: You can turn on the charm.

01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:04.013
You can woo them with your wiles.

01:18:04.013 --> 01:18:06.963
LAURA: I can make them totally
fall in love with me with spells.

01:18:06.963 --> 01:18:10.083
SAM: Do you think we would investigate like-- because most

01:18:10.083 --> 01:18:13.103
sort of private-for-hire sort of detectives

01:18:13.103 --> 01:18:15.953
investigate like, "Oh, I think she's cheating on me."

01:18:15.953 --> 01:18:17.363
That sort of, like, boring stuff.

01:18:17.363 --> 01:18:18.463
Are you interested in that?

01:18:18.463 --> 01:18:20.903
LAURA: I mean, I like the
high profile cases, you know what I mean?

01:18:20.903 --> 01:18:22.368
SAM: I agree.
LAURA: Yeah.

01:18:22.368 --> 01:18:25.931
SAM: I don't want to just be, like, tracking some guy--

01:18:25.931 --> 01:18:26.906
LAURA: Murder.

01:18:26.906 --> 01:18:29.191
SAM: And catching him fondling some person.

01:18:29.191 --> 01:18:31.627
LAURA: Yeah, no, awful, boring.
SAM: I don't care about that.

01:18:31.627 --> 01:18:32.460
LAURA: Murder.
SAM: Murder.

01:18:32.460 --> 01:18:34.223
LAURA: Espionage.
SAM: Kidnap.

01:18:34.223 --> 01:18:35.773
LAURA: Grand theft...

01:18:35.773 --> 01:18:36.898
SAM: Carriage.

01:18:36.898 --> 01:18:38.714
LAURA: Yeah.
(laughter)

01:18:38.714 --> 01:18:40.399
SAM: Yeah.
LAURA: Definitely.

01:18:40.399 --> 01:18:41.543
SAM: All right.
(laughter)

01:18:41.543 --> 01:18:44.290
MATT: (raspy voice) "By what will
do you disturb the sanctum?"

01:18:44.290 --> 01:18:48.033
SAM: Oh, fucking shit!
(laughter)

01:18:48.033 --> 01:18:49.533
MATT: At this point, you realize your conversation may have

01:18:49.533 --> 01:18:51.663
gotten a bit loud, and this voice emerges

01:18:51.663 --> 01:18:52.583
from the space around you,

01:18:52.583 --> 01:18:54.923
sounding like a roaring, crackling fire,

01:18:54.923 --> 01:18:58.043
and a dense wind filled with sand and dust battering

01:18:58.043 --> 01:18:59.647
the side of a rock-filled valley.

01:18:59.647 --> 01:19:01.826
LAURA: What did you say?

01:19:01.826 --> 01:19:05.097
MATT: "The sanctum must be cleansed."

01:19:05.097 --> 01:19:07.780
LAURA: No, no, no. (stammering)

01:19:07.780 --> 01:19:09.963
Yussa sent us, Yussa sent us, Yussa sent us.

01:19:09.963 --> 01:19:11.638
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:19:11.638 --> 01:19:14.053
(laughter)

01:19:14.053 --> 01:19:15.856
SAM: We are great detectives.

01:19:15.856 --> 01:19:19.775
(laughter)

01:19:19.775 --> 01:19:21.388
LAURA: Okay.
TALIESIN: Hardy Boys.

01:19:21.388 --> 01:19:23.954
LAURA: Twenty...

01:19:23.954 --> 01:19:26.483
24.

01:19:26.483 --> 01:19:30.583
MATT: 24, as you're both on the cusp of this cavern,

01:19:30.583 --> 01:19:32.671
looking out of this expanse and investigating

01:19:32.671 --> 01:19:34.703
the walkway out, and having this conversation,

01:19:34.703 --> 01:19:36.933
you hear the voice and you glance up,

01:19:36.933 --> 01:19:40.343
and there, standing right above the lip of this,

01:19:40.343 --> 01:19:41.543
and you now can see behind you

01:19:41.543 --> 01:19:43.473
this massive, blackened mountain,

01:19:43.473 --> 01:19:46.256
this volcanic mass of rock

01:19:46.256 --> 01:19:49.322
in which various long tendrils

01:19:49.322 --> 01:19:52.203
of glowing, orange lava are pouring down the sides.

01:19:52.203 --> 01:19:56.563
You see clasped over the side, a massive semi-humanoid,

01:19:56.563 --> 01:20:01.563
almost feminine figure made of just roiling flame.

01:20:01.693 --> 01:20:04.633
This entire torso, just burning ember,

01:20:04.633 --> 01:20:06.503
and bright light, and fire.

01:20:06.503 --> 01:20:09.203
The head itself, the hair, the swirling mass

01:20:09.203 --> 01:20:12.996
of spiraling flame, the eyes, these burning cinders.

01:20:14.903 --> 01:20:17.333
"The sanctum must be cleansed."

01:20:17.333 --> 01:20:20.713
And it dives, curling over on the inside.

01:20:20.713 --> 01:20:22.463
This is a large entity that

01:20:23.853 --> 01:20:26.203
darts into the tunnel like a reverse backdraft.

01:20:27.073 --> 01:20:27.906
SAM: Past us?

01:20:27.906 --> 01:20:31.403
LAURA: It didn't respond to my "Yussa sent us"?

01:20:31.403 --> 01:20:33.090
MATT: At the moment, it did not.

01:20:33.090 --> 01:20:34.216
LAURA: Yeah. Oh no.

01:20:34.216 --> 01:20:36.193
We should take off, yeah, at full sprint.

01:20:36.193 --> 01:20:37.207
SAM: Oh, shit.

01:20:37.207 --> 01:20:38.365
LAURA: (yelling)

01:20:38.365 --> 01:20:40.720
We found someone!

01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:42.202
MATT: As you guys are rushing past the fall,

01:20:42.202 --> 01:20:44.929
you can see like the light source of this flaming entity

01:20:44.929 --> 01:20:47.303
just vanishing. It is much quicker than both of you.

01:20:47.303 --> 01:20:48.743
LAURA: (screaming)
SAM: Even at a full,

01:20:48.743 --> 01:20:50.833
dash-y run, I can't--?

01:20:50.833 --> 01:20:54.174
MATT: At a full, dash run, you can go how fast in a turn?

01:20:54.174 --> 01:20:56.925
SAM: 30, 30, 30, so 90 if I use my action.

01:20:56.925 --> 01:20:59.633
LAURA: I can go 60 on a turn.

01:20:59.633 --> 01:21:00.893
MATT: You cannot keep up with this entity.

01:21:00.893 --> 01:21:02.218
SAM and LAURA: Oh.

01:21:03.783 --> 01:21:06.253
MATT: As it darts around, the rest of you are sitting there

01:21:06.253 --> 01:21:10.543
waiting and you hear these faint voices,

01:21:10.543 --> 01:21:14.233
and shouting-- or conversation from the far end,

01:21:14.233 --> 01:21:18.713
echoing down the hallway, and you hear, sourceless, echoing

01:21:18.713 --> 01:21:21.023
through the tunnel, the same phrasing,

01:21:21.023 --> 01:21:25.883
the same, "By what will do you disturb the sanctum?"

01:21:25.883 --> 01:21:27.143
LIAM: Oh dear.

01:21:27.143 --> 01:21:31.243
SAM: If I've run a whole round, can I cast Message then?

01:21:31.243 --> 01:21:33.699
MATT: "The sanctum must be cleansed."

01:21:33.699 --> 01:21:35.543
LIAM: Marion, Yeza, Luc, please back up

01:21:35.543 --> 01:21:37.297
to the end of the cavern, please.

01:21:37.297 --> 01:21:39.363
MATT: And they all start beginning to back up,

01:21:39.363 --> 01:21:41.533
Marion takes Luc and Yeza, and both of them

01:21:41.533 --> 01:21:42.903
pull them back towards

01:21:42.903 --> 01:21:45.363
the shelving unit on the far side,

01:21:45.363 --> 01:21:46.943
and there's a little space behind it,

01:21:46.943 --> 01:21:48.333
that they begin to shuffle in towards.

01:21:48.333 --> 01:21:50.285
LIAM: Yeah, duck down behind that furniture, thank you.

01:21:50.285 --> 01:21:52.556
Oh, we ready?

01:21:53.813 --> 01:21:54.703
MATT: What are you doing?

01:21:54.703 --> 01:21:57.803
SAM: I'm just casting Message, as I run, to Caleb

01:21:57.803 --> 01:22:02.070
saying: Fire creature incoming, get ready, get to safety!

01:22:03.370 --> 01:22:06.053
LAURA: I'm going to just be shouting as I'm running down

01:22:06.053 --> 01:22:09.198
going: We mean no harm, we're just friends,

01:22:09.198 --> 01:22:11.295
we're just visiting!

01:22:11.295 --> 01:22:13.533
LIAM: I'm going to not shove hard,

01:22:13.533 --> 01:22:15.116
but just scooch Caduceus away from me,

01:22:15.116 --> 01:22:18.483
so that we split away from the entrance of that cavern,

01:22:18.483 --> 01:22:20.236
going to the sides.
MATT: Okay.

01:22:21.303 --> 01:22:23.714
Let me go ahead and arrange--

01:22:23.714 --> 01:22:25.639
(shouting)

01:22:25.639 --> 01:22:27.056
MARISHA: Oh, shit.
SAM: Oh no.

01:22:27.056 --> 01:22:28.961
ASHLEY: Oh shit, this is bad.

01:22:28.961 --> 01:22:30.720
LAURA: Oops, that was probably my fault.

01:22:30.720 --> 01:22:32.923
LIAM: Jester and Nott were in the in-between space

01:22:32.923 --> 01:22:35.723
from Beetlejuice, where the sand worms live,

01:22:35.723 --> 01:22:36.993
going like, "What do you want to do this weekend?"

01:22:36.993 --> 01:22:38.593
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:22:38.593 --> 01:22:41.673
SAM: This hellish combat brought to you by Dwarven Forge's

01:22:41.673 --> 01:22:44.263
exclusive build of the month for March is available now,

01:22:44.263 --> 01:22:46.283
each build includes a custom encounter.

01:22:46.283 --> 01:22:47.810
A bonus gift card.
ALL: Oh!

01:22:47.810 --> 01:22:49.793
SAM: And of course, Dwarven Forge's hand-sculpted

01:22:49.793 --> 01:22:50.943
and hand-painted terrain.

01:22:50.943 --> 01:22:52.583
Delve into the sea cave of secrets at

01:22:52.583 --> 01:22:55.013
bit.ly/dwarvenforgecr.
TRAVIS: Wow.

01:22:55.013 --> 01:22:56.438
Holy shit, Matt.
SAM: Whoa.

01:22:56.438 --> 01:22:57.271
MATT: Marion.

01:22:57.271 --> 01:22:58.461
TRAVIS: What the fuck, man?
MATT: Luc.

01:22:58.461 --> 01:23:01.983
LAURA: This is gorgeous.
MATT: And Yeza.

01:23:01.983 --> 01:23:03.879
SAM: The lava is so cool.

01:23:03.879 --> 01:23:06.293
TRAVIS: Dude, it's cooling in the pool.

01:23:06.293 --> 01:23:09.951
MARISHA: Wow, that looks awesome.

01:23:09.951 --> 01:23:11.723
MATT: So Caduceus and Caleb,

01:23:11.723 --> 01:23:12.556
whereabouts are you?

01:23:12.556 --> 01:23:14.689
If this is the exit you found,

01:23:14.689 --> 01:23:16.913
and this is the little study area there?

01:23:16.913 --> 01:23:19.723
LIAM: Is there a safe way away
from the exit into the chamber,

01:23:19.723 --> 01:23:22.768
or is it all locked off from lava flow?

01:23:22.768 --> 01:23:23.983
MATT: It's around here.

01:23:23.983 --> 01:23:25.673
LIAM: Okay.
MATT: Very thin bridge.

01:23:25.673 --> 01:23:27.203
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

01:23:27.203 --> 01:23:29.483
LIAM: Well then, since I just
said what I said about Caduceus,

01:23:29.483 --> 01:23:31.823
I'll say that I'm still in harm's way

01:23:31.823 --> 01:23:33.614
by the exit.

01:23:34.697 --> 01:23:35.897
MATT: Over here?

01:23:35.897 --> 01:23:38.823
LIAM: Well, I pushed Caduceus out of harm's way in the door,

01:23:38.823 --> 01:23:40.143
so no.

01:23:40.143 --> 01:23:41.473
Shoot.

01:23:41.473 --> 01:23:43.689
LIAM: I mean, you tell me, but I thought--

01:23:43.689 --> 01:23:45.905
This is not going to work at all.

01:23:45.905 --> 01:23:47.883
I would have been right at the arch.

01:23:47.883 --> 01:23:49.453
That's where I was casting the dome.

01:23:49.453 --> 01:23:50.295
MATT: Correct, yeah.

01:23:50.295 --> 01:23:52.293
So you would have been--
LIAM: Let's say I'm still there

01:23:52.293 --> 01:23:54.383
and I pushed Caduceus out of the way to safety.

01:23:54.383 --> 01:23:57.073
TALIESIN: So I'm--
MATT: Which way do you push Caduceus?

01:23:57.073 --> 01:23:58.456
TALIESIN: Away from the lava.

01:23:58.456 --> 01:24:00.763
LIAM: Away, sideways.
MATT: Here?

01:24:00.763 --> 01:24:01.788
LIAM: No.

01:24:01.788 --> 01:24:03.061
LAURA: Just across the bridge, yeah.

01:24:03.061 --> 01:24:04.727
LIAM: Behind Caleb, yeah, yep.

01:24:04.727 --> 01:24:06.163
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: Yeah, that's it.

01:24:06.163 --> 01:24:08.603
MATT: I will ask you to make an acrobatics check,

01:24:08.603 --> 01:24:10.603
Caduceus, as this is a rapid attempt

01:24:10.603 --> 01:24:12.723
to move past a very thin channel

01:24:12.723 --> 01:24:13.903
that when you're taking your time

01:24:13.903 --> 01:24:16.206
is not too difficult, but in a rush?

01:24:19.113 --> 01:24:20.378
TALIESIN: No, I don't have time to give myself anything.

01:24:20.378 --> 01:24:22.113
MATT: It's not terribly difficult, but--

01:24:22.113 --> 01:24:24.247
TALIESIN: Acrobatics check, where's my acrobatics?

01:24:24.247 --> 01:24:25.380
That's 13.

01:24:25.380 --> 01:24:26.703
MATT: 13'll do it.

01:24:26.703 --> 01:24:27.733
So you manage to push past

01:24:27.733 --> 01:24:30.613
and put yourself on that end, and the heat is just burning.

01:24:30.613 --> 01:24:32.223
And it does cool a little bit, once it seems to hit

01:24:32.223 --> 01:24:34.703
that bottom pool area, but nevertheless,

01:24:34.703 --> 01:24:37.728
it is dangerous.

01:24:37.728 --> 01:24:41.024
I would like everyone to roll initiative.

01:24:41.024 --> 01:24:42.356
TRAVIS: Oh, boy.

01:24:43.233 --> 01:24:44.883
MATT: You haven't seen this creature arrive yet.

01:24:44.883 --> 01:24:46.273
You're not entirely certain what it looks like,

01:24:46.273 --> 01:24:50.235
but we will get to that likely shortly.

01:24:50.235 --> 01:24:51.660
TALIESIN: Well, that sucks.

01:24:53.333 --> 01:24:54.166
MATT: All right.

01:24:57.388 --> 01:24:59.003
That's okay, it rolls a natural one,

01:24:59.003 --> 01:25:01.076
so it's going last probably.

01:25:01.076 --> 01:25:02.009
TRAVIS: (southern drawl) Last.

01:25:02.009 --> 01:25:03.425
MATT: 25 to 20.

01:25:05.303 --> 01:25:07.145
20 to 15?

01:25:07.145 --> 01:25:09.363
TRAVIS: Come on, guys!

01:25:09.363 --> 01:25:10.493
MATT: Hey, if this was the one roll to roll poorly,

01:25:10.493 --> 01:25:11.709
I guess this is the one.

01:25:11.709 --> 01:25:12.999
15 to 10.

01:25:14.183 --> 01:25:15.750
TRAVIS: Wow.
MATT: What?!

01:25:15.750 --> 01:25:17.413
TRAVIS: Has that ever happened before?

01:25:17.413 --> 01:25:19.833
Sub-tens only?

01:25:19.833 --> 01:25:21.266
MARISHA: Wow.

01:25:21.266 --> 01:25:23.153
LAURA: We're losers.
TRAVIS: Really?

01:25:23.153 --> 01:25:25.483
MATT: Your NPCs are going before you are!

01:25:25.483 --> 01:25:26.316
LIAM: Nine.

01:25:26.316 --> 01:25:28.193
MARISHA: No!
LAURA: Nine!

01:25:28.193 --> 01:25:30.429
TRAVIS: Your son is going to hit it before you do.

01:25:30.429 --> 01:25:33.872
(laughter)

01:25:33.872 --> 01:25:36.083
MARISHA: Your four-year-old is faster than you.

01:25:36.083 --> 01:25:38.453
SAM: I also rolled a natural one.

01:25:38.453 --> 01:25:39.993
MATT: Okay, well, all right.

01:25:39.993 --> 01:25:42.715
So coming around on this, we have nine.

01:25:42.715 --> 01:25:44.356
TALIESIN: Four.
MARISHA: (arrow vibrating)

01:25:44.356 --> 01:25:45.239
LAURA: Nine.

01:25:45.239 --> 01:25:47.163
MATT: Okay, Jester--
TRAVIS: Wow.

01:25:47.163 --> 01:25:48.293
That's amazing.
LAURA: Oh my god.

01:25:48.293 --> 01:25:51.406
SAM: I rolled a one for a total of six, I guess.

01:25:51.406 --> 01:25:53.543
MATT: So you're going simultaneously with this creature.

01:25:53.543 --> 01:25:54.376
SAM: Okay.

01:25:54.376 --> 01:25:55.551
MATT: And your dex is?

01:25:57.423 --> 01:25:58.693
SAM: 20.

01:25:58.693 --> 01:26:01.333
MATT: Man, go ahead and roll a d20 for me,

01:26:01.333 --> 01:26:03.051
see who goes first.
SAM: Oh, boy.

01:26:03.051 --> 01:26:04.178
Just a 12.

01:26:04.178 --> 01:26:05.394
MATT: It's going before you do.

01:26:05.394 --> 01:26:06.623
SAM: Oh, man.

01:26:06.623 --> 01:26:08.723
MATT: All right, then we have-- and Caduceus, you are what?

01:26:08.723 --> 01:26:09.703
TALIESIN: Four.
MATT: Four, so you are

01:26:09.703 --> 01:26:11.381
actually going last.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:26:14.634 --> 01:26:17.563
LAURA: Oh god.
MATT: All right, so.

01:26:17.563 --> 01:26:22.563
For Marion, Luc, and Yeza's turn,

01:26:22.570 --> 01:26:25.463
they go ahead and push Luc behind this bookcase.

01:26:26.918 --> 01:26:29.143
Yeza's going to go ahead and dart behind this one

01:26:29.143 --> 01:26:30.833
to try and hide as well.

01:26:30.833 --> 01:26:33.174
And Marion's going to go ahead and

01:26:33.174 --> 01:26:36.082
go behind with Luc.

01:26:36.082 --> 01:26:38.123
And they're just trying to stay out of the way

01:26:38.123 --> 01:26:40.873
while keeping an eyeline on you best they can.

01:26:40.873 --> 01:26:42.413
That brings us to Caleb.

01:26:42.413 --> 01:26:43.363
What are you doing?

01:26:44.573 --> 01:26:46.393
LIAM: Do I see this threat coming yet?

01:26:46.393 --> 01:26:47.553
Or do I just hear it?
MATT: I will say,

01:26:47.553 --> 01:26:49.893
because the tunnel snakes a little bit

01:26:49.893 --> 01:26:51.873
and all you see is this pitch-black darkness,

01:26:51.873 --> 01:26:55.573
and suddenly bright light beginning to brighten

01:26:55.573 --> 01:26:56.963
and come your direction.

01:26:56.963 --> 01:26:59.938
Once again, it's like a column of fire

01:26:59.938 --> 01:27:02.337
or a freight train

01:27:02.337 --> 01:27:03.873
about to come around the corner.

01:27:03.873 --> 01:27:04.706
It's just this--

01:27:04.706 --> 01:27:06.543
LIAM: Do I feel heat coming as well?

01:27:06.543 --> 01:27:07.443
MATT: You might soon.

01:27:07.443 --> 01:27:09.793
But you see the light first.
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:27:09.793 --> 01:27:13.834
I am going to

01:27:13.834 --> 01:27:15.767
check something real quick.

01:27:17.183 --> 01:27:18.791
MARISHA: Map looks great.

01:27:18.791 --> 01:27:20.423
TALIESIN: Map's gorgeous.

01:27:20.423 --> 01:27:22.773
ASHLEY: It is so cool.

01:27:22.773 --> 01:27:23.606
MARISHA: Looks great on camera.

01:27:23.606 --> 01:27:25.412
ASHLEY: Look at the little waterfall on the left!

01:27:25.412 --> 01:27:26.290
MARISHA: Isn't it awesome?

01:27:26.290 --> 01:27:27.415
TRAVIS: Your maps suck.
SAM: It'll be the last thing

01:27:27.415 --> 01:27:28.864
you see.
MATT: Thanks. Keep me humble.

01:27:28.864 --> 01:27:30.913
MARISHA: (laughs) Keeping us humble, yeah.

01:27:30.913 --> 01:27:34.643
LIAM: Okay, I'm going to raise up Allura's staff

01:27:34.643 --> 01:27:36.153
and point it down the chamber,

01:27:36.153 --> 01:27:38.723
and I am going to fire off Cone of Cold.

01:27:38.723 --> 01:27:39.973
SAM: Yes!

01:27:39.973 --> 01:27:41.923
LIAM: Down that hallway.

01:27:41.923 --> 01:27:44.343
MATT: Okay, so you're holding it until you see something?

01:27:44.343 --> 01:27:45.923
LIAM: If I see-- well,

01:27:45.923 --> 01:27:47.613
I feel like something hot is coming.

01:27:47.613 --> 01:27:49.253
So yeah, I'll say--

01:27:49.253 --> 01:27:50.713
MATT: You don't see a target yet is why.

01:27:50.713 --> 01:27:53.123
If you release it now, it may or may not hit.

01:27:53.123 --> 01:27:55.403
LIAM: But the hallway is lit up, right?

01:27:55.403 --> 01:27:56.803
MATT: Like, around the corner.
LIAM: I'll wait till I see it.

01:27:56.803 --> 01:27:57.636
I'll wait till I see it.
MATT: Okay.

01:27:57.636 --> 01:27:59.076
So you're holding Cone of Cold until it arrives?
LIAM: Yeah.

01:27:59.076 --> 01:28:00.813
MATT: You got it.
TRAVIS: That's a fair bet that'll do well.

01:28:00.813 --> 01:28:03.246
MATT: Okay, so as you're holding the staff in front,

01:28:04.863 --> 01:28:06.893
what little bit of moisture your presence has brought

01:28:06.893 --> 01:28:11.893
begins to gather and crystallize in this vibrating

01:28:11.953 --> 01:28:15.155
burst of bluish-white ice energy at the edge of the staff.

01:28:15.155 --> 01:28:16.983
And you're just holding it, and you can feel it.

01:28:16.983 --> 01:28:18.303
It's fighting to be released,

01:28:18.303 --> 01:28:20.113
and you're having to hold the staff.

01:28:20.113 --> 01:28:21.693
You're still not used to controlling it,

01:28:21.693 --> 01:28:23.623
and it's a little bit of a tug of war with the power

01:28:23.623 --> 01:28:25.945
that's being held at the tip of it.

01:28:25.945 --> 01:28:27.079
SAM: Easy, Betsy.

01:28:27.079 --> 01:28:28.300
MATT: And you're staying put?

01:28:28.300 --> 01:28:29.603
TRAVIS: (whinnys)

01:28:29.603 --> 01:28:31.143
LIAM: Yeah.

01:28:31.143 --> 01:28:32.533
MATT: Okay, that finishes your go.

01:28:32.533 --> 01:28:34.284
Jester, you're up.
LIAM: Come on, Allie.

01:28:34.284 --> 01:28:36.446
LAURA: Okay.

01:28:44.090 --> 01:28:44.923
Okay.

01:28:44.923 --> 01:28:46.547
TRAVIS: How we doing? How we doing?

01:28:46.547 --> 01:28:49.144
LAURA: Well, I got two options here.

01:28:51.013 --> 01:28:54.436
I can try to play nice or I can try to play mean.

01:28:55.706 --> 01:28:57.573
And I don't know--

01:28:57.573 --> 01:28:59.282
SAM: We're in hell.

01:28:59.282 --> 01:29:02.564
LAURA: -- ♪ which way I want to go. ♪

01:29:02.564 --> 01:29:04.106
SAM: ♪ Which way ♪

01:29:05.913 --> 01:29:08.053
LAURA: Fuck it, I'm going to try it.

01:29:08.053 --> 01:29:09.653
I'm going to try-- wait, hold on.

01:29:11.493 --> 01:29:12.403
I'm just going to say--

01:29:12.403 --> 01:29:13.883
I'm just going to see if-- because I don't know.

01:29:13.883 --> 01:29:16.753
I haven't done this one enough to know if

01:29:16.753 --> 01:29:21.098
they get advantage if you're in combat on Modify Memory.

01:29:21.980 --> 01:29:23.163
MATT: You're going to try Modify Memory?

01:29:23.163 --> 01:29:23.996
LAURA: Yeah.

01:29:35.943 --> 01:29:38.143
MATT: Okay, yeah, we can totally give it a shot.

01:29:40.033 --> 01:29:41.193
All right.

01:29:41.193 --> 01:29:42.953
It's a wisdom saving throw?
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

01:29:42.953 --> 01:29:43.969
MATT: All righty.

01:29:49.413 --> 01:29:50.388
17?

01:29:50.388 --> 01:29:51.793
LAURA: 18.

01:29:51.793 --> 01:29:53.533
MATT: Okay, what do you do?

01:29:53.533 --> 01:29:56.774
LAURA: I'm going to modify this creature's memory

01:29:56.774 --> 01:29:58.482
to think that...

01:30:02.891 --> 01:30:06.271
it knew we were coming and that we're friendly.

01:30:08.463 --> 01:30:10.680
That it received word ahead of time.

01:30:24.873 --> 01:30:29.873
MATT: Says, "you must speak to the creature to describe

01:30:29.943 --> 01:30:31.443
"how its memories are affected."

01:30:33.733 --> 01:30:34.566
LAURA: Okay.

01:30:41.173 --> 01:30:44.263
MATT: It's a full minute of concentration to do it, so.

01:30:44.263 --> 01:30:47.296
It is charmed by you for the time period.

01:30:48.684 --> 01:30:51.016
LAURA: Oh, wait. It's one action casting time.

01:30:51.016 --> 01:30:53.953
It's a concentration up to a minute of--

01:30:53.953 --> 01:30:54.983
MATT: Correct. "While the charm lasts,

01:30:54.983 --> 01:30:57.363
"you can affect the target's memory of an event

01:30:57.363 --> 01:30:59.657
"that it experienced in the last 24 hours."
LAURA: Okay.

01:30:59.657 --> 01:31:01.243
MATT: "And lasted no more than 10 minutes.

01:31:01.243 --> 01:31:02.683
"You must speak to the target to describe

01:31:02.683 --> 01:31:04.036
"how its memory is altered.

01:31:05.033 --> 01:31:08.953
And "if the spell ends before you finish describing

01:31:08.953 --> 01:31:12.023
"the modified memories, the
creature's memory isn't altered."

01:31:12.023 --> 01:31:15.493
LAURA: Okay. It's a hard thing to use in combat, then.

01:31:15.493 --> 01:31:18.653
MATT: Yeah, it's not really a combat spell, generally.

01:31:18.653 --> 01:31:19.486
LAURA: Yeah.

01:31:19.486 --> 01:31:20.535
MATT: But situationally,

01:31:20.535 --> 01:31:21.603
it can be doable.

01:31:21.603 --> 01:31:22.896
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: So.

01:31:25.343 --> 01:31:27.223
As you finish casting the spell,

01:31:27.223 --> 01:31:29.103
and you're pretty confident that it took hold,

01:31:29.103 --> 01:31:31.313
it slows its traction, but it's--

01:31:31.313 --> 01:31:32.390
It's charmed by you.

01:31:33.763 --> 01:31:35.896
But it's still working towards its goal.

01:31:37.693 --> 01:31:39.343
So what are you shouting?

01:31:39.343 --> 01:31:41.290
LAURA: Don't you remember that you got word

01:31:43.263 --> 01:31:45.553
three hours ago that we were going to be here?

01:31:45.553 --> 01:31:48.583
We're the best of friends! We're friends with the people

01:31:48.583 --> 01:31:52.232
that live here, which could be you.

01:31:52.232 --> 01:31:56.103
(laughter)

01:31:56.103 --> 01:31:57.553
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: That took less than

01:31:57.553 --> 01:31:59.323
six seconds to say, right?

01:31:59.323 --> 01:32:01.148
MATT: Yeah, I'll allow it, sure, sure.

01:32:01.148 --> 01:32:02.293
TRAVIS: Totally.

01:32:02.293 --> 01:32:04.573
MATT: In a very rapid, Jester rambling kind of way, totally.

01:32:04.573 --> 01:32:05.543
It makes complete sense.

01:32:05.543 --> 01:32:07.366
MARISHA: We got a code when we booked.

01:32:08.331 --> 01:32:09.547
(laughter)
MARISHA: Do you not see it?

01:32:09.547 --> 01:32:11.797
LIAM: Your B-take will be a little faster, it's fine.

01:32:11.797 --> 01:32:13.913
MATT: Okay. Oh, and if you are fighting the creature

01:32:13.913 --> 01:32:15.103
it has advantage in the saving throw.

01:32:15.103 --> 01:32:16.903
LAURA: Oh, see, that's why I was asking.

01:32:16.903 --> 01:32:17.926
I couldn't remember.
MATT: Sorry.

01:32:17.926 --> 01:32:18.873
I double-checked that.

01:32:18.873 --> 01:32:21.648
So that is a natural 20.

01:32:21.648 --> 01:32:23.113
SAM: Ugh.
MARISHA: No!

01:32:23.113 --> 01:32:24.123
MATT: I am so sorry.

01:32:24.123 --> 01:32:24.956
LAURA: I wouldn't have done it

01:32:24.956 --> 01:32:25.983
if it would've had advantage on it.

01:32:25.983 --> 01:32:27.313
That's okay.
MATT: It's at the top of the spell.

01:32:27.313 --> 01:32:29.165
I just looked up and saw that, I'm sorry.

01:32:29.165 --> 01:32:29.998
LAURA: That's okay.

01:32:29.998 --> 01:32:31.203
LIAM: Shit happens.

01:32:31.203 --> 01:32:33.203
MATT: Oh, that would have been really interesting, too.

01:32:33.203 --> 01:32:34.128
LAURA: No, it's all good.

01:32:34.128 --> 01:32:35.990
MATT: Well, you have another 5th-level spell, so.

01:32:35.990 --> 01:32:37.477
You can always try it again if you--

01:32:37.477 --> 01:32:39.293
(laughter)

01:32:39.293 --> 01:32:41.133
It slows for a moment as you start shouting this,

01:32:41.133 --> 01:32:43.073
and it seems to nudge its way forward

01:32:43.073 --> 01:32:44.356
and pick up pace.
TRAVIS: Priceline?

01:32:44.356 --> 01:32:45.606
SAM: Does Expedia exist any more?

01:32:45.606 --> 01:32:47.173
MATT: All right, that finishes it.

01:32:47.173 --> 01:32:50.836
To-- finish your turn? It's now its turn.

01:32:52.253 --> 01:32:54.263
Since it went before Veth.

01:32:54.263 --> 01:32:57.795
The creature, the brightness suddenly lights up the interior

01:32:57.795 --> 01:32:59.823
of the hallway like a rolling fireball.

01:32:59.823 --> 01:33:02.543
These flaming, curling horns

01:33:02.543 --> 01:33:06.033
leading it as it darts through

01:33:06.033 --> 01:33:09.133
just into range as you release the spell.

01:33:09.133 --> 01:33:11.450
This blast of freezing cold energy

01:33:11.450 --> 01:33:14.343
immediately flash-freezes the inside of this

01:33:14.343 --> 01:33:16.943
entire hallway, and blasts into this creature.

01:33:16.943 --> 01:33:19.093
Is it a constitution saving throw, correct?

01:33:21.503 --> 01:33:22.823
LIAM: It is--
MATT: 14.

01:33:22.823 --> 01:33:25.273
I do not believe it makes it based on the item.

01:33:25.273 --> 01:33:27.183
The DC of the--
LIAM: That's 30--

01:33:27.183 --> 01:33:30.213
The DC-- is the staff different than me?

01:33:30.213 --> 01:33:31.046
Hold on.

01:33:33.913 --> 01:33:34.821
MATT: It may not specify.

01:33:34.821 --> 01:33:37.061
If it does not specify, then it'd be your spell DC.

01:33:38.473 --> 01:33:42.406
LIAM: Well, my DC is--

01:33:43.363 --> 01:33:44.656
MATT: I'm pretty sure a 14 doesn't make it.

01:33:44.656 --> 01:33:46.031
So just go ahead and roll damage.

01:33:46.031 --> 01:33:47.214
LIAM: So 38 points.

01:33:47.214 --> 01:33:48.383
MATT: 38 points of cold damage.

01:33:48.383 --> 01:33:50.353
You got it.
LIAM: And I rolled a five,

01:33:50.353 --> 01:33:52.643
so the staff, which is now out of charges,

01:33:52.643 --> 01:33:55.303
did not lose all of its great powers.

01:33:55.303 --> 01:33:56.136
MATT: Great.

01:33:56.136 --> 01:33:57.626
LIAM: Because if it rolls a one, it does.

01:33:58.663 --> 01:33:59.883
MATT: You got it, so (explosion).

01:33:59.883 --> 01:34:02.633
It goes off, immediately the whole wall just flash-freezes

01:34:02.633 --> 01:34:04.912
and the creature pushes through it.

01:34:04.912 --> 01:34:06.943
You can see its flames burn brighter for a second.

01:34:06.943 --> 01:34:10.213
Almost angrily pushing off the freezing cold.

01:34:10.213 --> 01:34:11.903
And at the same time, all the ice that's gathered

01:34:11.903 --> 01:34:16.373
on the walls immediately turns to vapor, instantaneously

01:34:16.373 --> 01:34:18.593
burned away, but it took a hit.

01:34:18.593 --> 01:34:21.623
With that, it's going to go ahead and continue its movement.

01:34:21.623 --> 01:34:23.363
LIAM: And I'm right in the path.

01:34:23.363 --> 01:34:24.453
MATT: Yes, you are.

01:34:24.453 --> 01:34:26.283
TALIESIN: That is not a humanoid, is it?

01:34:26.283 --> 01:34:28.267
LAURA: Nope.
MATT: Nope.

01:34:28.267 --> 01:34:29.433
It rushes past you.

01:34:29.433 --> 01:34:31.160
ASHLEY: Big girl.

01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:32.680
TRAVIS: It's a big girl.
LIAM: Yeah.

01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:33.546
MATT: Igniting you,

01:34:33.546 --> 01:34:35.154
so you are now on fire.
SAM: Oh no.

01:34:35.154 --> 01:34:35.987
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

01:34:35.987 --> 01:34:37.613
MATT: We'll go ahead and put that right there.

01:34:37.613 --> 01:34:39.123
So you are burning.
SAM: What?

01:34:39.123 --> 01:34:41.843
MARISHA: That is a really cool fire elemental mini.

01:34:41.843 --> 01:34:43.133
TRAVIS: This whole thing is cool.

01:34:43.133 --> 01:34:44.733
MARISHA: Yeah, this is so sick.

01:34:44.733 --> 01:34:46.093
MATT: Stay right there, since you're the one

01:34:46.093 --> 01:34:48.246
that's immediately there and just blasted it.

01:34:49.973 --> 01:34:54.606
Angrily, it whooshes around

01:34:54.606 --> 01:34:56.106
and is going to go ahead and do

01:34:56.106 --> 01:34:57.823
two touch attacks against you as it rakes

01:34:57.823 --> 01:35:00.550
its flaming claws down towards you angrily, saying,

01:35:00.550 --> 01:35:03.673
"The sanctum must be cleansed."

01:35:03.673 --> 01:35:05.623
MATT: Jesus Christ, natural 20.

01:35:05.623 --> 01:35:06.456
TALIESIN: Cancel.

01:35:07.463 --> 01:35:08.523
MATT: Which you can do.

01:35:08.523 --> 01:35:09.356
TRAVIS: Cancel!

01:35:10.904 --> 01:35:12.404
MATT: It still hits, though.
LIAM: Yeah.

01:35:13.433 --> 01:35:16.413
MATT: And that'll be a 14 to hit.

01:35:16.413 --> 01:35:17.675
LIAM: Does not hit.
LAURA: Which, for Caleb,

01:35:17.675 --> 01:35:18.833
is like a crit, really.

01:35:18.833 --> 01:35:19.692
MATT: Yeah, that's pretty fair. Huh?
LAURA: Any hit.

01:35:19.692 --> 01:35:20.525
LIAM: It doesn't hit.

01:35:20.525 --> 01:35:21.512
MATT: It doesn't hit, all righty.

01:35:24.333 --> 01:35:27.130
So the one hit does hit you. It is not a crit.

01:35:27.130 --> 01:35:30.053
You're close enough for that.
LIAM: What was your roll?

01:35:30.053 --> 01:35:31.119
MATT: It was a natural 20.

01:35:31.119 --> 01:35:32.835
LIAM: Oh, it's still 20, okay.

01:35:35.111 --> 01:35:36.796
But I can do Shield for that.

01:35:38.053 --> 01:35:39.499
So I will.

01:35:39.499 --> 01:35:40.332
MATT: You're going to do a Shield for that?
LIAM: Yeah.

01:35:40.332 --> 01:35:41.423
MATT: Okay.

01:35:41.423 --> 01:35:43.223
LIAM: That'll get me over 20.

01:35:43.223 --> 01:35:44.056
MATT: It will, yeah.

01:35:44.056 --> 01:35:45.483
LIAM: Will the 20 still hit, though?

01:35:45.483 --> 01:35:48.320
MATT: It was a natural 20, so its bonuses go on top of that.

01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:49.643
LIAM: Oh, okay.

01:35:49.643 --> 01:35:51.511
MATT: So you can do a Shield if you want to, if you feel it.

01:35:51.511 --> 01:35:54.504
LIAM: If I understand how the rules work now, then no.

01:35:54.504 --> 01:35:55.803
(laughter)

01:35:55.803 --> 01:35:57.213
TRAVIS: If I play D&amp;D now.

01:35:57.213 --> 01:35:58.313
LIAM: Burn me. Nurn me, baby.

01:35:58.313 --> 01:35:59.404
MATT: Okay, you got it.

01:35:59.404 --> 01:36:00.895
TRAVIS: Make it burn.
MARISHA: If you cancel the crit,

01:36:00.895 --> 01:36:03.115
it doesn't get to roll double dice. Is that what it is?

01:36:03.115 --> 01:36:03.948
TALIESIN: It's just a normal hit,

01:36:03.948 --> 01:36:05.603
it's not a crit hit.
MARISHA: Cool.

01:36:05.603 --> 01:36:07.213
MATT: 22 points of fire damage to you.

01:36:07.213 --> 01:36:09.803
LIAM: Okay.
MATT: And you are already ignited.

01:36:09.803 --> 01:36:11.813
So you're okay.

01:36:11.813 --> 01:36:15.333
As it stands there going (snarling), parts of its body

01:36:15.333 --> 01:36:18.324
are flickering and swirling,

01:36:18.324 --> 01:36:21.007
and even the molten rock

01:36:21.007 --> 01:36:22.983
beneath it, you can see the parts that are

01:36:22.983 --> 01:36:24.733
starting to darken and cool right below it

01:36:24.733 --> 01:36:26.083
are starting to brighten and heat up

01:36:26.083 --> 01:36:27.276
just with its proximity.

01:36:28.883 --> 01:36:31.135
That's going to end its go. It is now Veth,

01:36:31.135 --> 01:36:33.663
then Caduceus following up after that.

01:36:33.663 --> 01:36:37.103
SAM: I will run to hopefully get it within my sight

01:36:37.103 --> 01:36:38.088
MATT: At this point, yeah.

01:36:38.088 --> 01:36:40.783
With your 30 movement, you can get to about

01:36:40.783 --> 01:36:43.833
there and see it up against Caleb.

01:36:43.833 --> 01:36:46.513
SAM: Is it within five feet of Caleb?

01:36:46.513 --> 01:36:47.346
MATT: It is.

01:36:47.346 --> 01:36:48.973
SAM: It's engaged with Caleb, all right.

01:36:48.973 --> 01:36:53.413
And so, when we were robbed, would you think that I would

01:36:53.413 --> 01:36:56.036
have my Cataclysm Bolts on me?

01:36:57.223 --> 01:36:59.740
MATT: Likely you wouldn't have kept them in the--

01:36:59.740 --> 01:37:00.623
LIAM: You want to be able to draw them.

01:37:00.623 --> 01:37:02.023
SAM: Yeah, I'd probably have them on me.

01:37:02.023 --> 01:37:02.856
MATT: Yeah.

01:37:02.856 --> 01:37:03.858
SAM: So I still have two of those.

01:37:03.858 --> 01:37:06.903
MATT: You do.
SAM: But Caleb is right there.

01:37:06.903 --> 01:37:08.713
So maybe I don't want to use one of those,

01:37:08.713 --> 01:37:12.346
because if it's the wrong one,

01:37:12.346 --> 01:37:14.220
it could really kill him.

01:37:16.649 --> 01:37:18.673
So I'll just fire a regular shot.

01:37:18.673 --> 01:37:20.183
I'll fire a regular--
MATT: Go for it.

01:37:20.183 --> 01:37:22.473
SAM: -- Boltblaster shot.

01:37:22.473 --> 01:37:24.113
15 plus things.

01:37:24.113 --> 01:37:26.203
So probably 25-- 26 to hit.

01:37:26.203 --> 01:37:27.363
MATT: That does hit, yeah.

01:37:27.363 --> 01:37:29.943
SAM: Because this creature is engaged,

01:37:29.943 --> 01:37:31.373
do I get my sneak attack?

01:37:31.373 --> 01:37:32.536
MATT: You do.
SAM: Okay.

01:37:36.963 --> 01:37:39.713
LAURA: I love that we still ask that question at this point.

01:37:40.973 --> 01:37:41.958
MATT: Hey, it's always good to check.

01:37:41.958 --> 01:37:42.866
LAURA: Six years.

01:37:42.866 --> 01:37:44.342
MARISHA: Yeah.
LAURA: (laughs)

01:37:44.342 --> 01:37:45.892
SAM: 40 points of damage.

01:37:45.892 --> 01:37:47.692
MATT: 40 points of damage. Slick!

01:37:49.213 --> 01:37:52.813
Right, so it's raking into Caleb. Caleb now in flames,

01:37:52.813 --> 01:37:55.971
which is still within his expertise.

01:37:55.971 --> 01:37:58.372
You rush around the corner, see that and fire at once.

01:37:58.372 --> 01:38:00.733
It strikes it in the middle of the torso area.

01:38:00.733 --> 01:38:02.543
And you see as it impacts,

01:38:02.543 --> 01:38:05.673
a portion within its flames darkens for a second,

01:38:05.673 --> 01:38:08.003
the flames go a blue-green angrily,

01:38:08.003 --> 01:38:09.653
like it's reacting to the impact.

01:38:10.943 --> 01:38:13.193
SAM: It looks like it took a hit?

01:38:13.193 --> 01:38:15.226
MATT: Took a hit, yeah.
SAM: Okay, okay.

01:38:18.563 --> 01:38:20.733
How far away am I now from it?

01:38:20.733 --> 01:38:22.548
MATT: You are 25 feet from it.

01:38:24.393 --> 01:38:26.146
You've used your movement and your action.

01:38:28.123 --> 01:38:29.603
SAM: It's probably going to like blast through

01:38:29.603 --> 01:38:32.353
the fucking thing.

01:38:32.353 --> 01:38:33.503
All right, I'll just fire again.

01:38:33.503 --> 01:38:36.203
I'll fire again, I got to get this thing down.

01:38:36.203 --> 01:38:37.873
That's a two, that probably misses.

01:38:37.873 --> 01:38:39.411
MATT: Well, a total of?
SAM: 13.

01:38:39.411 --> 01:38:41.113
MATT: 13 misses, yeah.

01:38:41.113 --> 01:38:43.313
So the first shot hits, second one, you get a little excited

01:38:43.313 --> 01:38:46.163
and fire again and it dodges to the side.

01:38:47.938 --> 01:38:49.893
That finishes your go. Caduceus, you're up.

01:38:49.893 --> 01:38:51.093
TALIESIN: Really, wow, okay.

01:38:51.093 --> 01:38:52.463
MATT: NPCs on deck.

01:38:52.463 --> 01:38:53.693
TALIESIN: I don't really know what to do.

01:38:53.693 --> 01:38:56.263
So I'm just going to cast Spirit Guardians

01:38:57.433 --> 01:38:58.266
because I'm just going to--

01:38:58.266 --> 01:38:59.232
MATT: At the top of your turn, by the way,

01:38:59.232 --> 01:39:01.453
just the proximity

01:39:01.453 --> 01:39:03.513
of being in its space within a certain range,

01:39:03.513 --> 01:39:04.873
you take seven points of fire damage.

01:39:04.873 --> 01:39:06.498
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to--

01:39:06.498 --> 01:39:08.514
Okay, seven points of fire damage.

01:39:08.514 --> 01:39:10.403
How close am I to it right now?

01:39:10.403 --> 01:39:12.163
MATT: You're about 10 feet from it.

01:39:12.163 --> 01:39:14.613
TALIESIN: Okay, well that's good because that means that.

01:39:16.046 --> 01:39:17.346
Where'd it go, where's my--?

01:39:20.763 --> 01:39:23.463
Shit, no, I can't do that, I'm sorry, I lost my place

01:39:23.463 --> 01:39:25.687
because I'm panic monkey.

01:39:26.604 --> 01:39:28.883
MARISHA: Do those tiles light up, or is it just--

01:39:28.883 --> 01:39:29.799
MATT: They do when you can get

01:39:29.799 --> 01:39:31.140
all the electrical connections

01:39:31.140 --> 01:39:32.583
to work and you aren't rushing

01:39:32.583 --> 01:39:33.903
to get it done before tonight.

01:39:33.903 --> 01:39:35.613
So a lot of this was supposed to light up from underneath.

01:39:35.613 --> 01:39:37.773
But I'm having issues with the electronics of it.

01:39:37.773 --> 01:39:39.161
So we're making it work.

01:39:39.161 --> 01:39:40.636
LIAM: Still looks fucking amazing.

01:39:40.636 --> 01:39:41.783
MATT: Making it work.

01:39:41.783 --> 01:39:42.616
SAM: Yawn.

01:39:42.616 --> 01:39:43.449
TRAVIS: ♪ Making it work ♪

01:39:43.449 --> 01:39:46.303
(laughter)

01:39:46.303 --> 01:39:47.433
MATT: Yeah, nothing like having it work

01:39:47.433 --> 01:39:48.428
and then setting up all the tiles

01:39:48.428 --> 01:39:50.023
and then plugging it in and realizing some of these tiles

01:39:50.023 --> 01:39:51.293
now aren't working for some reason.

01:39:51.293 --> 01:39:53.113
I only have 20 minutes before we start filming.

01:39:53.113 --> 01:39:56.363
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Spirit Guardians.

01:39:56.363 --> 01:39:57.313
MATT: Spirit Guardians, all right.

01:39:57.313 --> 01:40:00.043
TALIESIN: Which gives me 15 feet of coverage

01:40:00.043 --> 01:40:03.759
of little insects and

01:40:05.868 --> 01:40:08.253
god only knows what can survive this heat.

01:40:08.253 --> 01:40:09.863
MATT: All righty.
SAM: Nice.

01:40:09.863 --> 01:40:10.696
TALIESIN: Let's see.

01:40:13.763 --> 01:40:15.113
And I'm going to back up.

01:40:16.533 --> 01:40:20.773
I'm going to back up to leave it, so I'm 15--

01:40:20.773 --> 01:40:22.873
I want it to just be on the edge of my spirit guardian

01:40:22.873 --> 01:40:26.213
so that I'm out of that 10-foot range.

01:40:26.213 --> 01:40:28.588
If I get the feeling that that's the--

01:40:28.588 --> 01:40:29.754
back out of the heat a little bit.

01:40:29.754 --> 01:40:31.379
MATT: Okay. As you back out of the heat,

01:40:31.379 --> 01:40:33.547
it does get an attack of opportunity on you.

01:40:33.547 --> 01:40:34.803
TALIESIN: Oh, it does? Okay.

01:40:34.803 --> 01:40:36.653
MATT: You realize now it has a reach of 10.

01:40:38.053 --> 01:40:40.143
That is 24 to hit.

01:40:40.143 --> 01:40:42.984
TALIESIN: You know, it hits.

01:40:45.553 --> 01:40:47.036
MATT: Ooh, that's not good.

01:40:47.036 --> 01:40:48.723
TALIESIN: That's not funny.

01:40:48.723 --> 01:40:49.556
MATT: Sorry.

01:40:54.513 --> 01:40:56.193
36 points of fire damage to you.

01:40:56.193 --> 01:40:58.493
TALIESIN: Cool.
MATT: And you are on fire.

01:41:00.117 --> 01:41:03.801
LAURA: ♪ Ca-duceus is on fire ♪

01:41:04.773 --> 01:41:06.939
MATT: You have begun to just burst into flame,

01:41:06.939 --> 01:41:08.733
and the flames are swirling up your shoulders

01:41:08.733 --> 01:41:10.482
and around you, and both you and Caleb are now

01:41:10.482 --> 01:41:11.757
burning alive.

01:41:13.454 --> 01:41:15.123
MARISHA: (laughs) Are burning alive.

01:41:15.123 --> 01:41:16.781
TALIESIN: Okay, cool, all right. I'm good.

01:41:16.781 --> 01:41:17.621
MATT: Okay.

01:41:17.621 --> 01:41:18.762
SAM: Yeah, Happy Fun Ball sounds great.

01:41:18.762 --> 01:41:19.623
MATT: Was that your concentration check?

01:41:19.623 --> 01:41:20.863
TALIESIN: Yeah, yeah.
MATT: You got it.

01:41:20.863 --> 01:41:22.553
All right, that finishes your go.

01:41:22.553 --> 01:41:24.344
Top, the NPCs.

01:41:25.811 --> 01:41:28.603
Luc is going to go ahead and fire

01:41:28.603 --> 01:41:30.143
his crossbow at the creature.
SAM: Yes!

01:41:30.143 --> 01:41:32.213
TRAVIS: Let's go, Luc!
MARISHA: Come on.

01:41:32.213 --> 01:41:33.221
TRAVIS: First blood!

01:41:34.363 --> 01:41:36.533
MATT: It just goes wide and actually burns

01:41:36.533 --> 01:41:39.073
partway through the air because it is a wooden dowel.

01:41:39.073 --> 01:41:41.973
And the heat in the chamber causes it to catch fire.

01:41:41.973 --> 01:41:44.462
He hides behind and looks to Dad and he goes,

01:41:44.462 --> 01:41:46.819
(whispering) "That was so cool."

01:41:46.819 --> 01:41:48.370
Yeza's like, "What are you doing?!"

01:41:48.370 --> 01:41:49.203
"Helping Mom."

01:41:49.203 --> 01:41:51.936
"Shh." He just holds him, pulls him in.

01:41:53.133 --> 01:41:54.880
Marion, kind of nervous, looks on the side.

01:41:54.880 --> 01:41:56.078
You're a bad influence.

01:41:56.078 --> 01:41:57.861
(laughter)

01:41:57.861 --> 01:41:59.393
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:41:59.393 --> 01:42:01.584
MATT: Caleb, you're up. Jester, you're on deck.

01:42:01.584 --> 01:42:03.113
ASHLEY: She's probably so scared.

01:42:03.113 --> 01:42:05.063
LIAM: For my action, I'm going to use

01:42:05.063 --> 01:42:06.754
the cantrip Control Flames

01:42:06.754 --> 01:42:08.743
to put out the flames all over my body.

01:42:08.743 --> 01:42:09.833
MATT: Great. Well, at the top of the round

01:42:09.833 --> 01:42:11.613
you do take--
LIAM: Okay.

01:42:11.613 --> 01:42:12.983
MATT: -- eight points of fire damage--
LIAM: Understood.

01:42:12.983 --> 01:42:14.483
MATT: -- from being on fire.
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

01:42:16.173 --> 01:42:19.860
So I hope, I think that Control Flames would put me out.

01:42:19.860 --> 01:42:22.463
MATT: Control Flames, yes, I would
say that would be the same.

01:42:22.463 --> 01:42:25.443
LIAM: And then, so that was my action.

01:42:25.443 --> 01:42:28.533
I will use my Stormrider Boots,

01:42:28.533 --> 01:42:30.433
which are just part of my movement.

01:42:30.433 --> 01:42:33.683
They'll fire up and I'm going to fly away

01:42:33.683 --> 01:42:37.493
from her into the library, and plunk down

01:42:37.493 --> 01:42:39.766
by where I see Marion is.

01:42:43.073 --> 01:42:45.153
MATT: 60 feet, right?
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

01:42:45.153 --> 01:42:46.757
It's 90 feet, actually.
MATT: 90 feet.

01:42:46.757 --> 01:42:48.203
And, yeah, you can plunk down right over here

01:42:48.203 --> 01:42:49.553
if you want to.
TALIESIN: Oh, shit.

01:42:51.343 --> 01:42:52.273
LIAM: I actually won't do that.

01:42:52.273 --> 01:42:54.303
I'll go in the middle of the library.

01:42:54.303 --> 01:42:56.177
MATT: Like right here?
LIAM: <i>Ja, ja</i>.

01:42:56.177 --> 01:42:58.243
I don't want to go too far away.

01:42:58.243 --> 01:43:00.743
And our tall, 50-foot woman

01:43:00.743 --> 01:43:03.883
would take 2d8 lightning damage as I passed by.

01:43:03.883 --> 01:43:06.333
MATT: All right, so as you dart by

01:43:06.333 --> 01:43:08.043
like a human lightning bolt, cannon-balling

01:43:08.043 --> 01:43:12.043
across the chamber, behind you, arcing past,

01:43:12.043 --> 01:43:14.003
you strike the side of its body and torso.

01:43:14.003 --> 01:43:15.613
And this energy mixes with the fire

01:43:15.613 --> 01:43:17.723
and causes this weird purple lightning (crackling)

01:43:17.723 --> 01:43:21.263
through its body. It (pained, raspy gasping)

01:43:21.263 --> 01:43:22.878
How much damage?
LIAM: 10 points lightning damage.

01:43:22.878 --> 01:43:24.169
MATT: 10 points, great.

01:43:25.933 --> 01:43:27.921
All righty, that finishes your go, Caleb?
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

01:43:27.921 --> 01:43:29.133
MATT: Jester, you're up.

01:43:29.133 --> 01:43:32.203
LAURA: Okay, so nice didn't work.

01:43:32.203 --> 01:43:34.593
So I'm going to move forward to where I can see her.

01:43:34.593 --> 01:43:37.359
MATT: You can get right next to--

01:43:40.663 --> 01:43:43.743
a little bit behind Veth, so.

01:43:43.743 --> 01:43:46.816
LAURA: Okay, and I'm going to--

01:43:48.459 --> 01:43:51.013
This is what I got. Cast Guiding Bolt.

01:43:51.013 --> 01:43:52.373
SAM: Sure.
LAURA: At 5th-level.

01:43:52.373 --> 01:43:53.683
MATT: At 5th-level, all righty.

01:43:53.683 --> 01:43:55.166
Go ahead and roll for an attack.

01:43:55.565 --> 01:43:56.949
LAURA: Oh my god.

01:43:56.949 --> 01:43:58.089
17.

01:43:58.089 --> 01:43:59.470
MATT: 17 just hits.

01:43:59.470 --> 01:44:01.420
(relieved exclaiming)

01:44:03.189 --> 01:44:04.098
LAURA: How many is this?

01:44:04.098 --> 01:44:06.064
8d6.

01:44:10.491 --> 01:44:11.324
Ooh!

01:44:11.324 --> 01:44:12.389
(giggling)

01:44:12.389 --> 01:44:14.269
This is so good!

01:44:14.269 --> 01:44:15.767
Oh my gosh!

01:44:15.767 --> 01:44:17.109
18.

01:44:17.109 --> 01:44:18.132
28.

01:44:19.039 --> 01:44:20.659
33.

01:44:20.659 --> 01:44:21.809
34!

01:44:21.809 --> 01:44:24.096
MARISHA: Looks like you're just
shoving your hand through a cake.

01:44:24.096 --> 01:44:26.346
(laughing)
LAURA: (eating noises)

01:44:27.329 --> 01:44:29.528
34 points of radiant damage.

01:44:29.528 --> 01:44:30.772
MATT: And the next attack against it has advantage.

01:44:30.772 --> 01:44:33.329
LAURA: Has advantage.
SAM: Hey, that's great!

01:44:33.329 --> 01:44:35.719
MATT: As it strikes, this burst of radiant energy

01:44:35.719 --> 01:44:36.919
blasted from the inside

01:44:36.919 --> 01:44:38.909
and you watch as its form quivers,

01:44:38.909 --> 01:44:40.029
like a flame that's briefly

01:44:40.029 --> 01:44:41.869
partially blown out by a strong wind.

01:44:41.869 --> 01:44:44.619
As it does, you see its body seems to

01:44:44.619 --> 01:44:47.089
briefly break apart into three separate parts,

01:44:47.089 --> 01:44:50.759
and then reform into the one whole (low growling),

01:44:50.759 --> 01:44:52.679
but you see the sparkle is still residing around it

01:44:52.679 --> 01:44:55.649
and giving even a brighter, more contrasting light

01:44:55.649 --> 01:44:58.785
against the fire light.
LAURA: Almost like a pink flame?

01:44:58.785 --> 01:45:00.165
Just, like, a little bit?

01:45:00.165 --> 01:45:02.039
MATT: Just a little bit, a little pink flame.

01:45:02.039 --> 01:45:03.748
You got it.

01:45:03.748 --> 01:45:05.604
All right, does that finish your turn, Jester?

01:45:05.604 --> 01:45:06.749
LAURA: Uh, mm-hmm!

01:45:06.749 --> 01:45:07.679
MATT: All righty.
TRAVIS: Just got this

01:45:07.679 --> 01:45:09.385
colored pine cone she throws.
LAURA: Yeah!

01:45:09.385 --> 01:45:12.599
MATT: It is now the creature's turn, so is it a wisdom save?

01:45:12.599 --> 01:45:14.929
TALIESIN: Spirit Guardians I don't think is--

01:45:14.929 --> 01:45:16.252
It's a wisdom save.

01:45:17.229 --> 01:45:18.549
MATT: That is an 11.

01:45:18.549 --> 01:45:19.382
TALIESIN: Nope.

01:45:20.249 --> 01:45:21.499
It ain't much, but--

01:45:22.779 --> 01:45:24.737
It ain't much, but that's not bad.

01:45:26.199 --> 01:45:28.111
That's 10 points of radiant damage.

01:45:28.111 --> 01:45:31.189
MATT: 10 points radiant damage, all right.

01:45:31.189 --> 01:45:35.431
It's flickering and starting to dematerialize in some ways

01:45:35.431 --> 01:45:36.959
before holding itself together.

01:45:38.399 --> 01:45:40.289
Its movement is halved, right?

01:45:40.289 --> 01:45:41.138
While it's in the radius?

01:45:41.138 --> 01:45:42.588
TALIESIN: While it's in the radius, yeah.

01:45:42.588 --> 01:45:46.130
MATT: It's just going to shift a little bit this way.

01:45:47.459 --> 01:45:49.222
Kind of can only get that far.

01:45:51.169 --> 01:45:52.444
I'll say about there.

01:45:53.919 --> 01:45:55.639
Kind of looking around and noticing

01:45:55.639 --> 01:45:57.109
everyone in the chamber around.

01:45:57.109 --> 01:45:58.069
You see it go--

01:45:59.419 --> 01:46:00.469
It begins to curl down,

01:46:00.469 --> 01:46:03.669
and as it does its arms clutch inward.

01:46:03.669 --> 01:46:06.009
The flames begin to darken

01:46:06.009 --> 01:46:07.859
and you see at the center of its core

01:46:08.999 --> 01:46:12.192
the light gets brighter and brighter as this spinning core.

01:46:14.833 --> 01:46:16.416
(explosion)

01:46:16.416 --> 01:46:18.822
As it releases an inferno in the space around it.

01:46:18.822 --> 01:46:20.383
SAM: Oh my god.
LAURA: Oh no!

01:46:20.383 --> 01:46:21.410
SAM: It's gonna kill my kid.

01:46:21.410 --> 01:46:24.186
LAURA: Is that the babies and Mama?

01:46:24.186 --> 01:46:26.539
MATT: It's a 50 foot radius, so we'll see.

01:46:26.539 --> 01:46:28.369
SAM: Oh boy.
MATT: It gets both of you.

01:46:28.369 --> 01:46:30.078
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MARISHA: I mean, yes.

01:46:30.078 --> 01:46:32.429
SAM: Oh god.
MARISHA: No!

01:46:32.429 --> 01:46:34.299
SAM: Oh man.
MATT: It just misses Marion

01:46:34.299 --> 01:46:36.579
and it does give some cover to--

01:46:36.579 --> 01:46:37.412
No, I'm sorry.

01:46:37.412 --> 01:46:40.759
It just misses Yeza and it does give cover,

01:46:40.759 --> 01:46:42.699
but it <i>would</i> still catch them.

01:46:45.309 --> 01:46:46.417
SAM: Oh no.

01:46:47.609 --> 01:46:48.902
Oh god.

01:46:50.259 --> 01:46:52.147
Matt's out here killing kids.

01:46:52.147 --> 01:46:54.480
TRAVIS: (laughs)

01:46:55.722 --> 01:46:58.019
TRAVIS: Yeza-- they'll roll to save, right?

01:46:58.019 --> 01:46:58.852
SAM: Uh-huh.

01:46:59.889 --> 01:47:01.039
TALIESIN: That's a lot of dice.

01:47:01.879 --> 01:47:04.283
ASHLEY: Yeah, he's picking up a lot of dice.

01:47:04.283 --> 01:47:06.869
TALIESIN: Hope you can pack some healing spells.

01:47:06.869 --> 01:47:08.719
LAURA: I've got no spells!

01:47:08.719 --> 01:47:09.856
TALIESIN: You're out?

01:47:09.856 --> 01:47:12.189
LAURA: That was it! I've got one 1st-level!

01:47:12.189 --> 01:47:13.839
I don't have anything!

01:47:13.839 --> 01:47:14.999
You got Revivify.

01:47:14.999 --> 01:47:17.092
TALIESIN: Yeah, but I might be toast.

01:47:18.579 --> 01:47:21.453
MATT: 39 points of fire damage to everybody.

01:47:21.453 --> 01:47:24.056
I need everybody to make a dexterity saving throw.

01:47:24.056 --> 01:47:26.539
SAM: Us, too, in the hallway?
LAURA: Me and Veth too?

01:47:26.539 --> 01:47:27.372
We're in the hallway.

01:47:27.372 --> 01:47:29.038
Did it get us?
MATT: Yeah, it got you guys, too,

01:47:29.038 --> 01:47:30.143
because you're right within the radius.

01:47:30.143 --> 01:47:32.618
ASHLEY: 39 points of damage?
LIAM: 18.

01:47:32.618 --> 01:47:33.558
TALIESIN: Dex saving?

01:47:33.558 --> 01:47:34.499
ASHLEY: Oh boy.

01:47:36.699 --> 01:47:37.822
TALIESIN: Maybe.
LIAM: If I fail, I'm out.

01:47:37.822 --> 01:47:39.889
ASHLEY: How many hit points does Luc have?

01:47:39.889 --> 01:47:41.209
LAURA: Not that many.

01:47:41.209 --> 01:47:42.479
MARISHA: There's no way.

01:47:42.479 --> 01:47:44.137
LAURA: Think about when we started what our--
MARISHA: Exactly.

01:47:44.137 --> 01:47:45.709
TRAVIS: Say that again, Liam.
If you fail, what?

01:47:45.709 --> 01:47:46.879
LIAM: If I fail this save, I'm going down.

01:47:46.879 --> 01:47:48.218
18?
MARISHA: You start with--

01:47:48.218 --> 01:47:50.211
ASHLEY: Nothing.
MARISHA: Like, 10 hit points.

01:47:50.211 --> 01:47:51.252
MATT: You need a 19.

01:47:51.252 --> 01:47:52.629
LIAM: It's a 19?

01:47:52.629 --> 01:47:53.949
Caleb's down.

01:47:53.949 --> 01:47:56.179
MARISHA: Oh fuck, you guys!

01:47:56.179 --> 01:47:57.012
ASHLEY: Wait, you're out?

01:47:57.012 --> 01:47:58.079
SAM: This is bad.
MARISHA: Fuck!

01:47:58.079 --> 01:47:59.639
ASHLEY: Oh no.
SAM: This is real bad.

01:47:59.639 --> 01:48:01.491
LAURA: Genuinely, all of us might--
MATT: Caduceus?

01:48:01.491 --> 01:48:02.349
TALIESIN: 16.

01:48:02.349 --> 01:48:05.614
LAURA: Was it 49 points?
MATT: 39 points of fire damage.

01:48:05.614 --> 01:48:06.632
LAURA: 39 or 49?

01:48:06.632 --> 01:48:08.469
SAM: 16.
MATT: 16?

01:48:08.469 --> 01:48:10.752
39 points of fire damage, you take half.

01:48:10.752 --> 01:48:11.949
SAM: Because of Evasion or whatever?

01:48:11.949 --> 01:48:12.782
MATT: Because of Evasion, yes.

01:48:12.782 --> 01:48:15.449
So that would be 19, I think.

01:48:15.449 --> 01:48:16.369
And then Jester?

01:48:16.369 --> 01:48:17.321
LAURA: 16. I failed.

01:48:17.321 --> 01:48:18.919
MATT: 39 points of fire damage.

01:48:18.919 --> 01:48:20.102
TALIESIN: Okay.

01:48:23.139 --> 01:48:23.972
MATT: Marion rolls it.

01:48:23.972 --> 01:48:25.319
I'm rolling natural 20s like a fucking--

01:48:25.319 --> 01:48:26.299
Marion rolls a natural 20

01:48:26.299 --> 01:48:27.819
and she is naturally half resistant.

01:48:27.819 --> 01:48:28.999
She only takes half of that.

01:48:28.999 --> 01:48:30.022
So Marion's up.

01:48:36.799 --> 01:48:40.539
They both have advantage because
they're behind the side there.

01:48:40.539 --> 01:48:44.962
Luc does roll a 20 total because he's got a dexterous mom.

01:48:46.579 --> 01:48:47.982
So it does not--

01:48:52.888 --> 01:48:53.721
TRAVIS: 19.

01:48:53.721 --> 01:48:55.854
ASHLEY: Oh boy.
MATT: Not even with that.

01:48:55.854 --> 01:48:58.153
You hear Marion scream.

01:48:58.153 --> 01:48:59.261
SAM: Oh god.

01:49:05.259 --> 01:49:07.150
MATT: That brings us to...

01:49:07.150 --> 01:49:08.108
Veth.

01:49:09.509 --> 01:49:10.342
SAM: All right.

01:49:10.342 --> 01:49:13.509
How far away am I from across the room there?

01:49:13.509 --> 01:49:18.332
MATT: You are approximately 90-ish so, 100 feet.

01:49:20.579 --> 01:49:22.659
SAM: I will--

01:49:22.659 --> 01:49:24.025
MARISHA: Took a gamble.

01:49:25.147 --> 01:49:26.488
Where to send them.

01:49:26.488 --> 01:49:29.300
SAM: I will run as--

01:49:29.300 --> 01:49:30.312
Oh boy.

01:49:33.909 --> 01:49:35.719
Is there a clear shot across the lava?

01:49:35.719 --> 01:49:37.482
Like, if I hopped on some rocks?

01:49:38.374 --> 01:49:41.219
MATT: There's a clear shot, if you roll properly.

01:49:41.219 --> 01:49:42.269
SAM: Yeah.

01:49:44.227 --> 01:49:47.477
I will clear shot across the lava using--

01:49:48.311 --> 01:49:50.299
Ah, shit. I've got to get this thing down.

01:49:50.299 --> 01:49:51.899
It's going to keep attacking us.

01:49:54.672 --> 01:49:56.413
LAURA: (whispering) Did you go down?

01:50:01.513 --> 01:50:02.571
SAM: I've got to get there.

01:50:02.571 --> 01:50:04.135
I have a couple rounds.

01:50:05.609 --> 01:50:06.442
MATT: My apologies.

01:50:06.442 --> 01:50:08.969
There is one more facet of this ability.

01:50:08.969 --> 01:50:09.939
SAM: Of this ability?

01:50:09.939 --> 01:50:11.979
MATT: When it unleashes the inferno,

01:50:11.979 --> 01:50:15.302
it tears itself apart as part of the explosion.

01:50:17.339 --> 01:50:19.219
SAM: And is gone forever?

01:50:19.219 --> 01:50:21.678
LAURA: Oh, it's small-- oh.
SAM: Oh!

01:50:23.099 --> 01:50:24.349
TRAVIS: It's worse.

01:50:24.349 --> 01:50:26.748
(laughs)

01:50:26.748 --> 01:50:28.656
ASHLEY: My apologies, it's actually worse for you all--

01:50:28.656 --> 01:50:30.699
TRAVIS: Oh fuck! (laughs)
ASHLEY: -- than originally thought.

01:50:30.699 --> 01:50:32.701
TRAVIS: (laughs)

01:50:32.701 --> 01:50:34.992
LAURA: I thought Matt was taking mercy on us for a second

01:50:34.992 --> 01:50:38.184
and going, "Oh, I forgot, I actually just killed him."

01:50:38.184 --> 01:50:39.585
MARISHA: Yah.

01:50:39.585 --> 01:50:40.418
LIAM: How do I get out of here?

01:50:40.418 --> 01:50:42.047
TRAVIS: Got to stop letting him wear pajama pants.

01:50:42.047 --> 01:50:44.663
MATT: So as you rush across the way--

01:50:44.663 --> 01:50:45.764
MARISHA: I've tried, I can't.

01:50:45.764 --> 01:50:47.522
MATT: -- you start running and you can see

01:50:47.522 --> 01:50:48.974
out of the corner of your eye

01:50:48.974 --> 01:50:52.437
it dissipates into these three smaller elementals.

01:50:53.379 --> 01:50:54.939
SAM: It's not engaged with anyone right now?

01:50:54.939 --> 01:50:55.939
MATT: At the moment, no.

01:50:57.588 --> 01:50:59.838
TRAVIS: (laughs)

01:51:01.910 --> 01:51:03.349
SAM: I'm trying to get some--

01:51:03.349 --> 01:51:04.182
Fuck.

01:51:07.029 --> 01:51:08.029
Ay-yi-yi.

01:51:08.029 --> 01:51:10.726
Let me look at these fucking Cataclysm Bolts again.

01:51:10.726 --> 01:51:11.823
That doesn't do much.
MARISHA: Donald Glover in that

01:51:11.823 --> 01:51:15.229
Community gif, walking with the pizza

01:51:15.229 --> 01:51:17.009
and everything's on fire.

01:51:17.009 --> 01:51:18.899
SAM: And become restrained.

01:51:18.899 --> 01:51:21.111
When you're restrained you can still attack though, right?

01:51:21.111 --> 01:51:23.087
MATT: Yeah, you just have disadvantage on it.

01:51:23.087 --> 01:51:25.509
LAURA: Yeza and Luc are both down, right?

01:51:25.509 --> 01:51:27.297
Or is it just Luc is down?

01:51:27.297 --> 01:51:29.209
MATT: You don't know.
SAM: Caleb's down.

01:51:29.209 --> 01:51:32.350
MATT: All you did was hear Marion scream.

01:51:34.207 --> 01:51:37.567
MARISHA: (quietly) I mean, yeah. He's down.

01:51:37.567 --> 01:51:38.599
SAM: I've got to get over there,

01:51:38.599 --> 01:51:40.614
but we've got to kill these fucking things!

01:51:40.614 --> 01:51:41.447
LAURA: We've got to kill them

01:51:41.447 --> 01:51:43.822
or else they're just going to kill us more.

01:51:45.799 --> 01:51:46.759
SAM: Then I will--

01:51:46.759 --> 01:51:48.299
Ah, shit.

01:51:52.062 --> 01:51:54.642
I've got to kill these fucking things.

01:51:56.905 --> 01:51:57.738
Okay.

01:51:58.889 --> 01:52:01.210
And I need Sneak Attack.

01:52:01.210 --> 01:52:02.426
I'll, um--

01:52:03.743 --> 01:52:05.649
I'll take the movement back.

01:52:05.649 --> 01:52:09.329
I'll bonus action hide I guess at the edge of the--

01:52:09.329 --> 01:52:10.289
MATT: Edge of here?

01:52:10.289 --> 01:52:11.397
SAM: Yeah.

01:52:13.229 --> 01:52:14.269
That's a--

01:52:16.069 --> 01:52:18.262
Oh, wait, I get advantage on hiding.

01:52:19.109 --> 01:52:21.069
That's 29 to hide.

01:52:21.069 --> 01:52:22.759
MATT: Okay. You may or may not be hidden.

01:52:22.759 --> 01:52:24.179
You just dart behind a wall,

01:52:24.179 --> 01:52:25.699
so you're probably going to have to

01:52:25.699 --> 01:52:27.409
change up your position a bit to come out of hiding,

01:52:27.409 --> 01:52:28.859
which looks like you can probably climb

01:52:28.859 --> 01:52:30.059
a little bit of this wall to do so.

01:52:30.059 --> 01:52:31.739
SAM: Sure. I'll do that.

01:52:31.739 --> 01:52:32.572
MATT: Okay.

01:52:32.572 --> 01:52:35.019
So you scramble up the side of this rock wall

01:52:35.019 --> 01:52:37.709
and peer out from the above part.

01:52:37.709 --> 01:52:40.219
SAM: And I'll load a Cataclysm Bolt.

01:52:40.219 --> 01:52:41.379
MATT: Okay.

01:52:41.379 --> 01:52:43.069
SAM: And fire it at the--

01:52:43.069 --> 01:52:44.979
They're all within, like, five feet of each other?

01:52:44.979 --> 01:52:47.649
MATT: Yes. They just split in the same space.

01:52:47.649 --> 01:52:49.409
SAM: I have a one in three chance,

01:52:49.409 --> 01:52:53.629
so I'll load a Cataclysm Bolt and
shoot it right at the lead guy.

01:52:53.629 --> 01:52:55.679
MATT: The one closest to you? Okay.

01:52:55.679 --> 01:52:58.129
LAURA: Is it advantage on any of them? (laughs)

01:52:58.129 --> 01:52:59.389
MATT: Right now they all have advantage on them

01:52:59.389 --> 01:53:00.779
because of your Guiding Bolt.

01:53:00.779 --> 01:53:03.509
SAM: Oh! Then I don't need to hide at all!

01:53:03.509 --> 01:53:05.491
LAURA: Because you instantly get--

01:53:05.491 --> 01:53:06.499
SAM: Because I would get Sneak Attack.

01:53:06.499 --> 01:53:08.999
So I'll just dash out there.

01:53:08.999 --> 01:53:10.432
LIAM: Because they're lit up from Jester's magic.

01:53:10.432 --> 01:53:11.919
MATT: So you dash out to there?

01:53:11.919 --> 01:53:14.059
SAM: Yeah. And fire as I go.

01:53:14.059 --> 01:53:16.166
LAURA: Come on.
MATT: Okay.

01:53:16.166 --> 01:53:17.132
LIAM: Come on, mama.

01:53:17.132 --> 01:53:18.111
SAM: Natural 20.

01:53:18.111 --> 01:53:19.889
(exclaiming)
TRAVIS: Come on!

01:53:19.889 --> 01:53:22.777
ASHLEY: That's a mad mama!
TRAVIS: Come the fuck on!

01:53:22.777 --> 01:53:24.799
ASHLEY: "Don't you touch my kid!"

01:53:24.799 --> 01:53:26.899
MATT: All right, so that doubles the dice for the--

01:53:26.899 --> 01:53:28.445
SAM: The lead.
MATT: Yep.

01:53:29.319 --> 01:53:31.852
SAM: So they're not that great, but.

01:53:32.840 --> 01:53:33.673
Eight.

01:53:35.412 --> 01:53:36.245
12.

01:53:37.129 --> 01:53:37.962
19.

01:53:39.099 --> 01:53:40.459
23.

01:53:40.459 --> 01:53:43.842
So 23 doubled is 46,

01:53:43.842 --> 01:53:48.575
plus six is 52 on the lead.

01:53:48.575 --> 01:53:50.919
Plus I have to roll to see

01:53:50.919 --> 01:53:53.289
what kind of Cataclysm Bolt this is.

01:53:53.289 --> 01:53:54.679
MATT: Indeed.
SAM: And I want it to be

01:53:54.679 --> 01:53:55.932
a three or a four.

01:53:56.894 --> 01:53:59.819
Fuck, it's a fucking one!

01:53:59.819 --> 01:54:01.619
LAURA: Which is fire damage?
SAM: Yeah.

01:54:03.095 --> 01:54:04.839
MARISHA: Oh fuck!

01:54:04.839 --> 01:54:07.779
MATT: That's the problem with the chaos of their type.

01:54:07.779 --> 01:54:10.139
LAURA: Does that mean they're immune completely?

01:54:10.139 --> 01:54:12.269
SAM: This is just extra damage on top.

01:54:12.269 --> 01:54:13.102
LAURA: Oh, okay!

01:54:13.102 --> 01:54:15.079
SAM: If it had been ice damage,

01:54:15.079 --> 01:54:18.149
it would have hurt all three of them with--

01:54:18.149 --> 01:54:19.639
and restrained them all.

01:54:19.639 --> 01:54:21.459
MATT: Yeah, which is unfortunate.

01:54:21.459 --> 01:54:25.829
However, the one you shot, the sheer fury

01:54:25.829 --> 01:54:29.219
of what you briefly imagine in your head

01:54:29.219 --> 01:54:30.609
may have transpired,

01:54:30.609 --> 01:54:33.119
while you were not there to see, necessarily,

01:54:33.119 --> 01:54:37.529
the moment of the dodging of it,

01:54:37.529 --> 01:54:40.649
realization of the blast wave,

01:54:40.649 --> 01:54:43.309
thinking of the proximity of your family,

01:54:43.309 --> 01:54:45.419
and then hearing Marion scream,

01:54:45.419 --> 01:54:47.902
everything just goes quiet for a second.

01:54:48.989 --> 01:54:53.349
You have that (pulsing heartbeat) moment,

01:54:53.349 --> 01:54:58.019
and as you were just

01:54:58.019 --> 01:54:59.949
phasing out of reality at this moment,

01:54:59.949 --> 01:55:02.009
your eyes go a bit blurry and the body takes over.

01:55:02.009 --> 01:55:04.079
And without even thinking, you just load the bolt,

01:55:04.079 --> 01:55:06.992
rush out to the side, fire it.

01:55:08.279 --> 01:55:09.899
Not even looking at the creature that you shot at

01:55:09.899 --> 01:55:12.959
as it strikes it and you hear an echo of a scream

01:55:12.959 --> 01:55:17.202
in your periphery as the impact causes it to dissipate.

01:55:20.519 --> 01:55:21.489
So that's your--

01:55:22.379 --> 01:55:24.120
SAM: And then I'll bonus action continue across.

01:55:24.120 --> 01:55:25.129
LAURA: Don't you get to fire it again

01:55:25.129 --> 01:55:26.319
because you got a natural 20?

01:55:26.319 --> 01:55:27.719
MATT: You do.
SAM: Oh, it fires again

01:55:27.719 --> 01:55:29.132
by itself actually.

01:55:30.659 --> 01:55:32.469
That's a 24?

01:55:32.469 --> 01:55:34.169
MATT: Well, you have advantage on the next shot, too,

01:55:34.169 --> 01:55:35.952
because all three of them are glowing.

01:55:36.979 --> 01:55:39.187
SAM: What does that mean? So I roll again?

01:55:40.169 --> 01:55:41.489
MATT: Because of your Guiding Bold and it split,

01:55:41.489 --> 01:55:42.939
technically that I'd say the magic would--

01:55:42.939 --> 01:55:43.772
SAM: Natural 20!

01:55:43.772 --> 01:55:47.520
(exclaiming and cheering)
TRAVIS: Let's go!

01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:48.850
MATT: This is crazy! All right.

01:55:48.850 --> 01:55:50.186
All right. Go ahead and roll--

01:55:50.186 --> 01:55:52.365
SAM: But this is not Sneak Attack?

01:55:52.365 --> 01:55:53.859
MATT: You can only Sneak Attack once per round, yeah.

01:55:53.859 --> 01:55:56.839
SAM: So it's just 1d6, which is three

01:55:56.839 --> 01:56:00.339
so that's doubled to six, plus six is 12 damage.

01:56:00.339 --> 01:56:02.299
And then I will roll another d6

01:56:02.299 --> 01:56:03.928
to see if this Cataclysm Bolt--

01:56:03.928 --> 01:56:04.962
MARISHA: Come on, ice!

01:56:07.029 --> 01:56:09.609
SAM: Two. It's another fucking fire one.

01:56:09.609 --> 01:56:11.269
(laughing)

01:56:11.269 --> 01:56:13.289
Goddamn it!

01:56:13.289 --> 01:56:14.758
TRAVIS: Two 20s in a row.

01:56:14.758 --> 01:56:16.719
LIAM: Pluses and minuses.
LAURA: It's pretty great.

01:56:16.719 --> 01:56:20.502
MATT: So as that one sinks another one (gasping growl),

01:56:20.502 --> 01:56:23.286
It took a little hit, but still standing.

01:56:23.286 --> 01:56:26.089
And you have your bonus action still.

01:56:26.089 --> 01:56:30.179
SAM: Yeah. I could fire again,
but I'm out of Cataclysm Bolts.

01:56:30.179 --> 01:56:31.669
So I will--

01:56:32.669 --> 01:56:35.589
Is it more important to try to--

01:56:35.589 --> 01:56:38.249
These guys have more than six more hit points, right?

01:56:38.249 --> 01:56:39.082
LIAM: Yeah.

01:56:39.082 --> 01:56:40.729
SAM: I'm going to keep dashing across.

01:56:40.729 --> 01:56:43.409
MATT: Okay. Make an acrobatics or athletics check.

01:56:43.409 --> 01:56:44.629
Your call.

01:56:44.629 --> 01:56:46.099
SAM: I will do acrobatics.

01:56:46.099 --> 01:56:48.179
That's a 17.

01:56:48.179 --> 01:56:49.959
MATT: 17.

01:56:49.959 --> 01:56:51.379
It gets a little dicey.

01:56:51.379 --> 01:56:53.119
Partway through, as you leap from this rock

01:56:53.119 --> 01:56:56.009
to the center part and catch yourself at the last minute,

01:56:56.009 --> 01:56:56.975
almost tumbling in.

01:56:56.975 --> 01:56:58.039
And the heat at this point,

01:56:58.039 --> 01:57:00.789
at this proximity is singeing you.

01:57:00.789 --> 01:57:02.336
You're wincing instinctually

01:57:02.336 --> 01:57:05.079
as you can feel your skin beginning to cook,

01:57:05.079 --> 01:57:06.659
and you take that final little bit

01:57:06.659 --> 01:57:09.029
and then leap off to catch the edge.

01:57:09.029 --> 01:57:10.739
As you hit it, your foot almost slips,

01:57:10.739 --> 01:57:13.999
but you manage to stop yourself and land on the other side.

01:57:13.999 --> 01:57:15.649
No additional issue.

01:57:15.649 --> 01:57:16.779
But that's the end of your movement there,

01:57:16.779 --> 01:57:18.422
getting that leap across.

01:57:19.569 --> 01:57:22.324
That finishes your go, Veth.

01:57:22.324 --> 01:57:23.309
MATT: Caduceus, you're up.

01:57:23.309 --> 01:57:25.959
TALIESIN: So would I have to make a roll

01:57:25.959 --> 01:57:29.139
if I just gently wanted to get to the other side

01:57:29.139 --> 01:57:30.725
back towards the door?

01:57:32.049 --> 01:57:33.309
MATT: Around the door that way?

01:57:33.309 --> 01:57:35.889
TALIESIN: The way that I came out when I got shoved.

01:57:35.889 --> 01:57:38.802
I just want to make my way back to the hallway.

01:57:39.669 --> 01:57:40.706
MATT: You would have to make another roll, yeah.

01:57:40.706 --> 01:57:42.979
Because it's still a rapid moving across

01:57:42.979 --> 01:57:44.179
a really tiny bridge of lava.

01:57:44.179 --> 01:57:45.524
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm just going to--

01:57:45.524 --> 01:57:47.449
MATT: You do take three points of fire damage

01:57:47.449 --> 01:57:49.179
because you're still on fire.

01:57:49.179 --> 01:57:52.582
TALIESIN: So what I'm going to do-- this is my plan.

01:57:53.449 --> 01:57:55.509
I can see-- who can I see?

01:57:55.509 --> 01:57:56.782
I can see--

01:57:58.629 --> 01:58:02.096
From my vantage point, I know where everybody is basically.

01:58:02.096 --> 01:58:03.099
MATT: Everyone but Jester,

01:58:03.099 --> 01:58:05.289
but you saw the bolt streak out from the hallway

01:58:05.289 --> 01:58:06.579
and you're familiar with her Guiding Bolt,

01:58:06.579 --> 01:58:08.429
so you assume she's right over there.

01:58:10.779 --> 01:58:11.669
TALIESIN: So--

01:58:15.792 --> 01:58:20.488
With Liam down, is Liam within 30 feet--

01:58:20.488 --> 01:58:21.389
LAURA: Who's Liam?

01:58:21.389 --> 01:58:22.972
TALIESIN: I know, my brain-- is Caleb--

01:58:24.009 --> 01:58:26.379
SAM: Who's Caleb? His name is Ren.

01:58:26.379 --> 01:58:28.859
SAM: Yep. Is Ben within--

01:58:28.859 --> 01:58:29.692
You're welcome.

01:58:29.692 --> 01:58:30.883
(laughing)

01:58:30.883 --> 01:58:32.099
TALIESIN: There we are.

01:58:32.099 --> 01:58:35.699
MATT: Caleb you saw drop across the room

01:58:35.699 --> 01:58:36.799
quite a distance from you.

01:58:36.799 --> 01:58:39.439
TALIESIN: Okay, but is he within 30 feet of everybody

01:58:39.439 --> 01:58:41.119
where I think everybody else is?

01:58:41.119 --> 01:58:42.259
MATT: It's possible.

01:58:42.259 --> 01:58:45.859
TALIESIN: Okay. I want to try and get a 30 foot--

01:58:45.859 --> 01:58:47.659
They're within 60 feet of me easily.

01:58:49.059 --> 01:58:50.250
MATT: Easily?

01:58:52.902 --> 01:58:54.549
MATT: Veth is within about 50 or so feet.

01:58:54.549 --> 01:58:56.499
Caleb's maybe around 65 feet.

01:58:57.919 --> 01:58:59.590
TALIESIN: Caleb's about 65?

01:59:02.359 --> 01:59:03.549
Oh, wouldn't matter because I need to drop--

01:59:03.549 --> 01:59:06.039
I'm going to try drop--
MATT: Yes, 65 feet.

01:59:06.039 --> 01:59:08.609
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and drop a sphere that gets--

01:59:08.609 --> 01:59:10.869
the sphere center can be 60 feet away from me.

01:59:10.869 --> 01:59:11.702
MATT: Then yeah, you can do that.

01:59:11.702 --> 01:59:14.479
TALIESIN: So I want to try and get everybody that I know

01:59:14.479 --> 01:59:15.949
that is in that corner of the room,

01:59:15.949 --> 01:59:17.069
definitely want to get Caleb,

01:59:17.069 --> 01:59:18.949
but I want to try and make sure that that sphere

01:59:18.949 --> 01:59:22.319
drops to where I think everybody's hiding.

01:59:22.319 --> 01:59:23.399
MATT: Okay. You got it.

01:59:23.399 --> 01:59:24.232
What are you dropping?

01:59:24.232 --> 01:59:27.509
TALIESIN: Mass Cure Wounds at 5th-level.

01:59:27.509 --> 01:59:29.209
So who's out?

01:59:29.209 --> 01:59:30.549
TALIESIN: You get 29 hit points.

01:59:30.549 --> 01:59:31.559
LIAM: Whoa.

01:59:31.559 --> 01:59:32.869
SAM: You can hit how many?

01:59:32.869 --> 01:59:35.199
TALIESIN: I can hit up to six people
within that 30 foot sphere,

01:59:35.199 --> 01:59:37.196
even if I can't see them.
LAURA: So Luc and Yeza?

01:59:37.196 --> 01:59:40.259
TALIESIN: If they're dead, they get 29 hit points,

01:59:40.259 --> 01:59:41.819
or if they're unconscious they get 29 hit points.

01:59:41.819 --> 01:59:42.879
If they're not unconscious,

01:59:42.879 --> 01:59:45.579
anyone who's not unconscious, on the other hand, gets--

01:59:51.299 --> 01:59:52.589
14 hit points.

01:59:52.589 --> 01:59:54.339
MATT: Marion heals 14 hit points.

01:59:54.339 --> 01:59:55.519
You got it. All right.

01:59:55.519 --> 01:59:56.659
And Caleb, you got that much.

01:59:56.659 --> 01:59:58.049
You are conscious now on the ground.

01:59:58.049 --> 01:59:59.632
SAM: So I got healed, too?

02:00:00.669 --> 02:00:01.502
TALIESIN: If you're in that--

02:00:01.502 --> 02:00:03.659
MATT: Yeah, he would be. Or she would be, sorry.

02:00:03.659 --> 02:00:05.375
SAM: 14 hit points?
MATT and TALIESIN: 14 hit points.

02:00:05.375 --> 02:00:07.039
SAM: Wow. That was awesome!
TALIESIN: I'm still on fire,

02:00:07.039 --> 02:00:07.899
but that's fine.

02:00:07.899 --> 02:00:08.879
TRAVIS: That's a huge turn.

02:00:08.879 --> 02:00:09.712
SAM: Yeah.
MARISHA: That is.

02:00:09.712 --> 02:00:10.545
LIAM: Yes, it is.

02:00:11.439 --> 02:00:12.272
LAURA: Wow, healers!

02:00:12.272 --> 02:00:14.959
TALIESIN: I'm just going to try and stay in the corner.

02:00:14.959 --> 02:00:16.186
MATT: Both of them are outside of the radius

02:00:16.186 --> 02:00:18.099
of your Spirit Guardians, just so you're aware.

02:00:18.099 --> 02:00:19.489
Make a concentration check for me by the way,

02:00:19.489 --> 02:00:20.322
because you did take the fire damage.

02:00:20.322 --> 02:00:21.539
TALIESIN: I did take the fire damage.

02:00:21.539 --> 02:00:23.169
That's true, although,

02:00:23.169 --> 02:00:25.309
I can't imagine it would go that poorly.

02:00:25.309 --> 02:00:26.469
No. I'm fine.

02:00:26.469 --> 02:00:27.559
MATT: Okay.

02:00:27.559 --> 02:00:28.392
They're both currently outside of the range

02:00:28.392 --> 02:00:29.912
of your Spirit Guardians in that corner.

02:00:32.249 --> 02:00:35.109
TALIESIN: You know, is there any safe way

02:00:35.109 --> 02:00:36.859
to get them just in the cusp of it?

02:00:38.329 --> 02:00:39.549
MATT: Yeah, if you want to jump on that little rock

02:00:39.549 --> 02:00:40.499
in the middle of the lava.

02:00:40.499 --> 02:00:41.609
TALIESIN: Hell no!

02:00:41.609 --> 02:00:43.339
MATT: (laughs)

02:00:43.339 --> 02:00:45.749
You can safely maybe get one of them within the radius.

02:00:45.749 --> 02:00:46.582
Just barely.

02:00:46.582 --> 02:00:47.415
If you want to get them both,

02:00:47.415 --> 02:00:48.665
you're probably going to have to engage with one of them.

02:00:48.665 --> 02:00:49.929
TALIESIN: You know, I'm feeling a little iffy,

02:00:49.929 --> 02:00:52.459
so if they try and get at me, they're going to--

02:00:52.459 --> 02:00:56.739
They probably have range, don't they, these little fucks.

02:00:56.739 --> 02:00:59.659
I'm going to just step so that one--

02:00:59.659 --> 02:01:00.849
and I'm going to hug the wall.

02:01:00.849 --> 02:01:02.039
MATT: All right, that'll get you about--

02:01:02.039 --> 02:01:03.109
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm staying on the wall!

02:01:03.109 --> 02:01:04.534
No, no, no. Yeah.

02:01:04.534 --> 02:01:06.369
I'm going to hug the wall to my--

02:01:06.369 --> 02:01:07.699
I don't have my laser.

02:01:07.699 --> 02:01:08.774
Yes, I do.

02:01:09.979 --> 02:01:11.578
Yeah. Just hug the wall.
MATT: You can get there

02:01:11.578 --> 02:01:12.689
and get it within the range.

02:01:12.689 --> 02:01:15.020
That's just barely getting it.

02:01:15.020 --> 02:01:16.839
TALIESIN: That will do it. I just want some distance.

02:01:16.839 --> 02:01:18.502
I want to encourage it to leave.

02:01:18.502 --> 02:01:19.409
MATT: Understood.

02:01:19.409 --> 02:01:20.909
It's a 15 foot distance.

02:01:20.909 --> 02:01:23.379
You can keep distance, but you have to get close enough.

02:01:23.379 --> 02:01:24.949
TALIESIN: Yeah, because if I go down, everything's fucked.

02:01:24.949 --> 02:01:25.782
MATT: Fair enough.

02:01:25.782 --> 02:01:27.409
All right. That finishes your go.

02:01:27.409 --> 02:01:28.671
Top of the round.

02:01:28.671 --> 02:01:29.929
TRAVIS: Kill her.

02:01:30.899 --> 02:01:34.024
MATT: Marion just shouts out,

02:01:34.024 --> 02:01:35.979
"Jester!

02:01:35.979 --> 02:01:38.359
"Somebody!"

02:01:38.359 --> 02:01:39.550
SAM: Oh boy.

02:01:41.447 --> 02:01:46.447
MATT: Yeza pokes from behind here, looks, and just runs.

02:01:46.695 --> 02:01:47.628
MARISHA: (gasps)

02:01:47.628 --> 02:01:48.524
Uh-oh!

02:01:51.549 --> 02:01:52.574
MATT: Caleb.

02:01:53.509 --> 02:01:54.342
Your go.
LIAM: Okay.

02:01:54.342 --> 02:01:56.899
So I'll use half of my movement to pull myself to standing.

02:01:56.899 --> 02:01:59.979
I obviously heard Marion scream.

02:01:59.979 --> 02:02:02.379
I heard little feet running.

02:02:02.379 --> 02:02:04.989
I don't hear or see Luc anywhere.

02:02:04.989 --> 02:02:07.079
Probably. I don't have much left.

02:02:07.079 --> 02:02:12.079
I will smear molasses along my hands

02:02:12.229 --> 02:02:16.878
and try to cast Slow on the two...

02:02:16.878 --> 02:02:17.961
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: -- creatures.

02:02:17.961 --> 02:02:21.699
Wisdom save against 18, spell save.

02:02:21.699 --> 02:02:22.789
MATT: One of them got a natural 20.

02:02:22.789 --> 02:02:24.601
I don't know why I'm rolling so many 20s today.

02:02:24.601 --> 02:02:25.809
That's insane.

02:02:28.109 --> 02:02:30.749
The other one got a 16.

02:02:30.749 --> 02:02:32.204
Which I think failed. Yeah.
LIAM: Fails.

02:02:33.069 --> 02:02:35.357
MATT: So that one is slowed.

02:02:39.079 --> 02:02:40.900
That one there, we'll say.

02:02:40.900 --> 02:02:42.007
Put on its head.

02:02:42.007 --> 02:02:43.257
A little crown.

02:02:44.269 --> 02:02:47.124
LIAM: And I will use my movement to--

02:02:47.124 --> 02:02:48.397
MATT: You got 15 more feet.

02:02:48.397 --> 02:02:50.372
LIAM: (exhales)

02:02:52.190 --> 02:02:53.259
LIAM: I'm going to move away.

02:02:53.259 --> 02:02:55.089
I'm going to move--

02:02:55.089 --> 02:02:56.229
Where am I?

02:02:56.229 --> 02:02:57.389
MATT: Right there.

02:02:57.389 --> 02:02:59.469
LIAM: Yeah, I'm going to move back towards that bookshelf.

02:02:59.469 --> 02:03:01.229
Not right to where Marion and Yeza are,

02:03:01.229 --> 02:03:03.069
but that other bookshelf.

02:03:03.069 --> 02:03:03.910
MATT: There?
LIAM: Yeah.

02:03:03.910 --> 02:03:05.169
We'll say right there.

02:03:05.169 --> 02:03:06.049
If that's as far aways as I can get.

02:03:06.049 --> 02:03:06.889
MATT: That's as far as you can get.

02:03:06.889 --> 02:03:08.369
LIAM: Yeah. That's the end of my turn.

02:03:08.369 --> 02:03:09.899
MATT: Okay. Got it.

02:03:09.899 --> 02:03:11.324
Jester, you're up.

02:03:11.324 --> 02:03:13.656
LAURA: I'm going to come up to--

02:03:14.633 --> 02:03:16.779
through the doorway for the first time,

02:03:16.779 --> 02:03:18.929
fully take in the room and just shout:

02:03:19.829 --> 02:03:20.995
It's okay, Mama!

02:03:20.995 --> 02:03:22.829
It's going to be okay!

02:03:22.829 --> 02:03:25.537
And I'm going to cast...

02:03:27.204 --> 02:03:28.637
Guiding Bolt

02:03:28.637 --> 02:03:33.270
at the one that's within

02:03:33.270 --> 02:03:35.670
Caduceus' Spirit Guardians.

02:03:35.670 --> 02:03:36.864
MATT: Okay. Go for it.

02:03:37.893 --> 02:03:39.169
Roll for the attack.

02:03:39.169 --> 02:03:42.669
SAM: Did they take any Spirit
Guardian damage this last time?

02:03:42.669 --> 02:03:43.502
TALIESIN: Top of the round,

02:03:43.502 --> 02:03:45.279
one of them takes Spirit Guardian damage,

02:03:45.279 --> 02:03:46.495
which is not much.

02:03:46.495 --> 02:03:48.369
LAURA: I don't think it hits. 14?

02:03:48.369 --> 02:03:49.603
MATT: 14 just hits.

02:03:49.603 --> 02:03:50.949
LAURA: (gasps) Oh my gosh!

02:03:50.949 --> 02:03:54.062
MATT: Their smaller forms, the ACs are diminished.

02:03:55.389 --> 02:03:56.572
That's twice, you've barely hit them.

02:03:56.572 --> 02:03:58.959
That's really [inaudible].

02:03:58.959 --> 02:04:00.009
LAURA: That's not as good.

02:04:01.769 --> 02:04:03.525
10 points of radiant damage.

02:04:03.525 --> 02:04:04.549
MATT: 10 points of radiant damage,

02:04:04.549 --> 02:04:09.549
and next attack on this one has advantage.

02:04:10.878 --> 02:04:11.936
That's fine right there.

02:04:11.936 --> 02:04:13.052
TALIESIN: I may be fucked.

02:04:15.169 --> 02:04:16.689
MATT: We'll do that. That'll go.

02:04:16.689 --> 02:04:17.522
Okay.

02:04:17.522 --> 02:04:19.049
TALIESIN: Not pleased with this.

02:04:19.049 --> 02:04:20.107
MATT: You still have 10 more feet of movement

02:04:20.107 --> 02:04:22.319
or you want to stay where you're put near the arch there?

02:04:24.419 --> 02:04:25.669
LAURA: I think I'm going to--

02:04:27.646 --> 02:04:30.109
I'm going to stay right there.

02:04:30.109 --> 02:04:31.329
I don't know what else I can do.

02:04:31.329 --> 02:04:32.842
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: Actually!

02:04:34.725 --> 02:04:37.879
I'm going to walk up to the edge of that lip

02:04:37.879 --> 02:04:40.229
right next to the lava, yeah, right about there,

02:04:42.769 --> 02:04:45.659
and just growl at the creatures

02:04:45.659 --> 02:04:47.569
to try to get them to come over to me.

02:04:47.569 --> 02:04:48.835
MATT: You've got it. All right.

02:04:48.835 --> 02:04:52.499
LAURA: Oh, oh! Sure, bonus action.

02:04:52.499 --> 02:04:56.949
I'm going to pull my stupid hand axe off my side

02:04:56.949 --> 02:04:58.819
and be like, (yells).

02:04:58.819 --> 02:05:01.089
First time I'm going to fucking use it in forever.

02:05:01.089 --> 02:05:02.322
MATT: So you're just holding your hand axe at the ready?

02:05:02.322 --> 02:05:05.409
LAURA: I'm just hold my hand axe, ready to attack fire!

02:05:05.409 --> 02:05:07.159
MATT: Hell yeah. You got it.

02:05:07.159 --> 02:05:09.199
TALIESIN: How good is your--

02:05:09.199 --> 02:05:10.390
what's your--

02:05:11.716 --> 02:05:13.619
LAURA: It's just a hand axe +1.

02:05:13.619 --> 02:05:14.452
TALIESIN: Hand axe +1, okay.

02:05:14.452 --> 02:05:16.189
MATT: That is magical. That'll help.

02:05:16.189 --> 02:05:17.022
All right. Finishing your turn.

02:05:17.022 --> 02:05:18.659
It's now their turn.

02:05:18.659 --> 02:05:20.402
The one that's in your sphere,

02:05:21.579 --> 02:05:24.222
that is an eight so it does not save.

02:05:26.639 --> 02:05:28.039
TALIESIN: Nine points.

02:05:28.039 --> 02:05:30.299
MARISHA: Kill it!
MATT: Nine points of radiant damage.

02:05:30.299 --> 02:05:32.179
And it gets struck and you can see it starting to flicker

02:05:32.179 --> 02:05:33.959
in its own right, but it's held up.

02:05:33.959 --> 02:05:35.292
The other one is slowed.

02:05:36.899 --> 02:05:39.969
This one is going to go ahead and close in on you, Caduceus.

02:05:39.969 --> 02:05:41.319
TALIESIN: Half speed.
LIAM: Half speed.

02:05:41.319 --> 02:05:42.419
MATT: Yep.

02:05:42.419 --> 02:05:44.269
It doesn't need to worry about that.

02:05:44.269 --> 02:05:48.119
It has a pretty decent speed even when halved.

02:05:48.119 --> 02:05:49.719
So it does close in on you.

02:05:49.719 --> 02:05:52.459
The other one that's slowed is half speed.

02:05:52.459 --> 02:05:57.177
And it's going to go ahead and move in towards Veth.

02:05:58.104 --> 02:06:00.006
Because it is slowed it does not get its multi attack.

02:06:00.006 --> 02:06:01.897
It only gets one attack.

02:06:03.149 --> 02:06:05.149
So the one that's against you, Caduceus,

02:06:06.469 --> 02:06:09.249
that is a 21 to hit.

02:06:09.249 --> 02:06:10.654
TALIESIN: Fuck.

02:06:10.654 --> 02:06:11.869
MATT: Is that a hit?
TALIESIN: Yep.

02:06:11.869 --> 02:06:12.977
MATT: Okay.

02:06:14.333 --> 02:06:17.546
You take seven points of fire damage.

02:06:18.519 --> 02:06:19.944
And 17, does that hit?

02:06:20.789 --> 02:06:22.121
TALIESIN: Ah! That's great.

02:06:22.121 --> 02:06:24.269
No, that does not, which also means

02:06:24.269 --> 02:06:26.859
that activates my Shield of Retribution.

02:06:26.859 --> 02:06:27.692
MATT: All righty.

02:06:27.692 --> 02:06:30.909
TALIESIN: So that's--

02:06:31.819 --> 02:06:34.052
Come on. (groans)

02:06:36.039 --> 02:06:39.564
10 points of force damage.

02:06:39.564 --> 02:06:40.449
MATT: Okay.

02:06:40.449 --> 02:06:43.049
TALIESIN: And it has to make a strength saving throw.

02:06:44.339 --> 02:06:46.314
MATT: Which would be an 11.

02:06:46.314 --> 02:06:49.059
TALIESIN: So it gets pushed 20 feet away from me,

02:06:50.199 --> 02:06:53.559
which also means it now takes more damage from leaving--

02:06:53.559 --> 02:06:55.579
does it take damage from leaving as well?

02:06:55.579 --> 02:06:56.779
MATT: No, I think it's when it enters

02:06:56.779 --> 02:06:57.809
or when it starts its turn.

02:06:57.809 --> 02:06:59.045
TALIESIN: Okay.

02:06:59.045 --> 02:07:00.419
MATT: But it does get shoved back,

02:07:00.419 --> 02:07:02.849
the flash of arcane energy blasting it backward.

02:07:02.849 --> 02:07:05.549
It hits the wall and curls back into its form.

02:07:07.572 --> 02:07:09.312
And the one that's going up against you, Veth,

02:07:10.659 --> 02:07:12.119
natural one.

02:07:12.119 --> 02:07:13.559
SAM: Miss.

02:07:13.559 --> 02:07:16.079
MATT: The Slow spell causes it to just

02:07:16.079 --> 02:07:18.759
go towards you and you just easily sidestep,

02:07:18.759 --> 02:07:20.159
but you're still not even focused on it.

02:07:20.159 --> 02:07:22.209
You're absentmindedly like Neo

02:07:22.209 --> 02:07:24.319
when he's parrying at the end of The Matrix.

02:07:24.319 --> 02:07:26.692
You're just not even focused on it at the moment.

02:07:27.739 --> 02:07:29.209
Okay. That finishes their go.

02:07:29.209 --> 02:07:30.042
Veth, you're up.

02:07:31.099 --> 02:07:33.209
SAM: Oh, this guy's on me now?

02:07:33.209 --> 02:07:34.042
MATT: Yeah.

02:07:37.699 --> 02:07:39.999
Does not get any reactions because it is slowed.

02:07:39.999 --> 02:07:40.832
SAM: Oh, great.

02:07:40.832 --> 02:07:42.629
Well then, I'll keep going.

02:07:42.629 --> 02:07:46.722
I'll go to see if my son is still there.

02:07:49.149 --> 02:07:49.982
MATT: You come around the corner

02:07:49.982 --> 02:07:53.759
and you can see Marion is holding Luc,

02:07:53.759 --> 02:07:58.759
who is currently lying still in her arms,

02:07:59.001 --> 02:08:00.701
skin badly burned.

02:08:00.701 --> 02:08:03.532
SAM: So Caduceus' heal did not affect--?

02:08:04.629 --> 02:08:05.739
MATT: Apparently it did not.

02:08:05.739 --> 02:08:06.749
TALIESIN: Really?

02:08:06.749 --> 02:08:07.582
MATT: Yeah.
MARISHA: Why?

02:08:07.582 --> 02:08:08.999
LAURA: Because his damage was so great

02:08:08.999 --> 02:08:11.382
that it knocked him immediately,

02:08:11.382 --> 02:08:12.690
so the heal didn't do anything.
MARISHA: No.

02:08:12.690 --> 02:08:14.739
MATT: If you take damage beyond a certain threshold

02:08:14.739 --> 02:08:15.689
in a single hit.

02:08:15.689 --> 02:08:17.582
TALIESIN: So we're going to need
to fix this when this is done.

02:08:17.582 --> 02:08:19.423
SAM: So he's unrevivable?
MARISHA: He's dead dead.

02:08:19.423 --> 02:08:21.317
LAURA: Well, he's Revivifiable.

02:08:21.317 --> 02:08:23.009
SAM: He's unhealable.
TALIESIN: I can do it when it's quiet.

02:08:23.009 --> 02:08:26.026
MATT: He is currently not moving, not breathing.

02:08:26.026 --> 02:08:27.759
SAM: Oh my god.

02:08:27.759 --> 02:08:29.351
MATT: So that's your movement.

02:08:32.409 --> 02:08:33.592
SAM: That's not good.

02:08:35.509 --> 02:08:39.139
I will just rage scream and I will fire

02:08:39.139 --> 02:08:43.829
at the one that's glowing with radiant damage, I guess.

02:08:43.829 --> 02:08:44.662
MATT: Okay.

02:08:49.626 --> 02:08:50.997
SAM: With advantage, right?
MATT: Mm-hm.

02:08:50.997 --> 02:08:52.949
SAM: So 29.

02:08:52.949 --> 02:08:55.199
MATT: That definitely hits, and you get Sneak Attack damage.

02:08:57.889 --> 02:08:59.575
SAM: This game sucks.

02:08:59.575 --> 02:09:01.833
ASHLEY: That's why Luc ran over to...

02:09:03.916 --> 02:09:04.749
Marion.

02:09:08.244 --> 02:09:09.410
Oh boy.

02:09:12.483 --> 02:09:14.229
SAM: 37 points of damage?

02:09:14.229 --> 02:09:15.544
MATT: 37 points.

02:09:17.319 --> 02:09:19.059
That one flickers out.

02:09:19.059 --> 02:09:21.439
MARISHA: Okay.
SAM: And I will continue

02:09:21.439 --> 02:09:24.439
to rage scream and shoot my bonus shot

02:09:24.439 --> 02:09:26.359
at that one closer to me.

02:09:26.359 --> 02:09:27.309
MATT: Go for it.

02:09:27.309 --> 02:09:29.009
SAM: That's a 23 to hit?

02:09:29.009 --> 02:09:29.949
MATT: That definitely hits.

02:09:29.949 --> 02:09:31.939
SAM: Just one of these.

02:09:31.939 --> 02:09:33.502
Eight points of damage.

02:09:34.519 --> 02:09:36.959
MATT: All right. It takes the hit.

02:09:36.959 --> 02:09:38.689
The first hit this one's really taken,

02:09:38.689 --> 02:09:41.429
and just still-- (growling)

02:09:41.429 --> 02:09:44.139
flickering and angrily its fire swirling in its space

02:09:44.139 --> 02:09:45.369
and it's still hungry.

02:09:45.369 --> 02:09:48.759
SAM: And I'll just, sort of, whatever movement I have left

02:09:48.759 --> 02:09:53.759
I'll just crouch down and grab my son.

02:09:54.219 --> 02:09:55.819
Or touch him.

02:09:55.819 --> 02:09:56.894
MATT: Caduceus.

02:09:59.693 --> 02:10:01.201
TALIESIN: I'm going to--

02:10:03.399 --> 02:10:07.529
I'm going to walk towards the one that's still standing.

02:10:07.529 --> 02:10:09.704
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Get it just in my--

02:10:09.704 --> 02:10:11.149
within the range of my bullshit

02:10:11.149 --> 02:10:13.099
and I'm, again, still trying to stay safe

02:10:13.099 --> 02:10:15.059
from any floor lava.

02:10:15.059 --> 02:10:16.539
MATT: Just about there.

02:10:16.539 --> 02:10:18.409
TALIESIN: And I'm just-- I don't have a lot,

02:10:18.409 --> 02:10:19.379
so I'm just going to do--

02:10:19.379 --> 02:10:22.109
I want to keep some shit because this is getting bad.

02:10:22.109 --> 02:10:25.159
So I'm going to do Sacred Flame.

02:10:25.159 --> 02:10:26.609
MATT: Okay. Wisdom save or dex save?

02:10:26.609 --> 02:10:28.205
TALIESIN: That's a dex save.

02:10:29.059 --> 02:10:30.489
MATT: That is a 12.

02:10:30.489 --> 02:10:31.722
TALIESIN: That does not save.

02:10:32.859 --> 02:10:33.899
So that's--

02:10:42.489 --> 02:10:43.322
12.

02:10:45.089 --> 02:10:47.129
17 points of radiant damage.

02:10:47.129 --> 02:10:47.962
MATT: All righty.

02:10:49.349 --> 02:10:50.182
Takes the hit.

02:10:50.182 --> 02:10:53.204
It's looking a little hurt.

02:10:53.204 --> 02:10:56.019
TALIESIN: And as a bonus action

02:10:56.019 --> 02:10:58.109
I'm going to drink a potion because ow.

02:10:58.109 --> 02:11:01.184
MATT: Oh, and you did take two points of fire damage

02:11:01.184 --> 02:11:02.519
at the top of the round because you're still on fire,

02:11:02.519 --> 02:11:04.319
and make a concentration check for me.

02:11:06.971 --> 02:11:09.819
TALIESIN: (relieved laughing)

02:11:09.819 --> 02:11:11.299
Good.

02:11:11.299 --> 02:11:13.739
Thank god for advantage. That would have been bad.

02:11:14.669 --> 02:11:19.578
I'm going to take a potion with my bonus action,

02:11:19.578 --> 02:11:20.589
if that's okay.

02:11:20.589 --> 02:11:22.251
MATT: Go for it.

02:11:22.251 --> 02:11:24.001
TALIESIN: It's not a lot, but I'll take it.

02:11:30.010 --> 02:11:31.349
I'll take that nine points.

02:11:31.349 --> 02:11:32.182
MATT: All right.

02:11:32.182 --> 02:11:33.829
Caleb.

02:11:33.829 --> 02:11:36.459
LIAM: I have nothing that can affect this thing.

02:11:36.459 --> 02:11:38.062
I'm completely tapped.

02:11:39.159 --> 02:11:42.349
So I am going to move--

02:11:42.349 --> 02:11:45.269
SAM: The staff can't do anything?
LIAM: It's empty.

02:11:45.269 --> 02:11:47.357
Where is Veth right now?

02:11:47.357 --> 02:11:49.119
MATT: Veth is 10 feet to your right.

02:11:49.119 --> 02:11:51.769
LIAM: Okay. I'm going to move and stand in front of Veth.

02:11:52.779 --> 02:11:56.219
I'm going to use a bonus action to take this potion myself,

02:11:56.219 --> 02:11:58.969
because Luc can't be helped by a potion.

02:11:58.969 --> 02:12:02.222
And I'm going to take the Dodge as an action, yeah.

02:12:03.679 --> 02:12:05.649
And I can help if we survive this.

02:12:05.649 --> 02:12:06.482
Five--

02:12:07.696 --> 02:12:11.639
(quietly) Nine, 10, 13, 17.

02:12:11.639 --> 02:12:13.639
Okay. That's the end of my turn.

02:12:13.639 --> 02:12:14.472
MATT: Okay.

02:12:15.499 --> 02:12:16.574
Jester.

02:12:18.399 --> 02:12:21.715
LAURA: I am going to

02:12:21.715 --> 02:12:23.848
try to engage it in melee,

02:12:23.848 --> 02:12:25.749
so that if it attacks anything, it attacks me.

02:12:25.749 --> 02:12:29.629
So I'm going to run over and try to jump over the river

02:12:29.629 --> 02:12:32.789
and come down with my axe on top of it.

02:12:32.789 --> 02:12:34.069
MATT: Acrobatics or athletics check.

02:12:34.069 --> 02:12:38.409
Your choice to try and leap across the lava.

02:12:38.409 --> 02:12:40.004
TALIESIN: Don't fall in, please.

02:12:40.004 --> 02:12:41.304
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

02:12:44.199 --> 02:12:45.479
LAURA: Nine?

02:12:45.479 --> 02:12:48.339
MARISHA: Oh, Jester.
SAM: Oh god.

02:12:48.339 --> 02:12:50.432
MARISHA: Oh no.
SAM: Oh god.

02:12:54.249 --> 02:12:56.809
MATT: Run, leap, get to that center rock

02:12:56.809 --> 02:12:59.399
and you just slightly overshot.

02:12:59.399 --> 02:13:01.429
You try and correct yourself and jump

02:13:02.969 --> 02:13:05.109
and you land short.

02:13:05.109 --> 02:13:07.308
Your leg's-- (hissing)

02:13:07.308 --> 02:13:09.469
into the very edge of it.

02:13:09.469 --> 02:13:11.542
You scream out instinctively in pain.

02:13:14.536 --> 02:13:15.999
TALIESIN: Oh no.

02:13:15.999 --> 02:13:17.769
ASHLEY: Oh god, I'm getting--

02:13:17.769 --> 02:13:18.602
SAM: Oh boy.

02:13:19.451 --> 02:13:21.209
MARISHA: I don't know if I'm hot or cold.

02:13:21.209 --> 02:13:22.859
ASHLEY: Me, too.
MARISHA: I'm in a cold sweat.

02:13:26.999 --> 02:13:27.832
MATT: Okay.

02:13:30.549 --> 02:13:32.069
LAURA: Lava does a whole lot.

02:13:32.069 --> 02:13:33.609
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Yes.

02:13:33.609 --> 02:13:34.834
LAURA: Like, over 100, do you think?

02:13:34.834 --> 02:13:37.019
TRAVIS: Like 10d10 or something like that.

02:13:37.019 --> 02:13:37.852
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:13:37.852 --> 02:13:39.632
You've got to get out of it.

02:13:39.632 --> 02:13:40.708
TRAVIS: Falling in--

02:13:40.708 --> 02:13:42.909
LAURA: That was a jump, so that's not my--

02:13:42.909 --> 02:13:43.742
That was my movement.

02:13:43.742 --> 02:13:44.979
Was that my full movement? That's not my full movement?

02:13:44.979 --> 02:13:46.469
ASHLEY: Are you down at all?

02:13:46.469 --> 02:13:48.439
LAURA: I'm down some, but I've still got

02:13:48.439 --> 02:13:49.659
a good amount of hit points.

02:13:49.659 --> 02:13:51.509
So it depends on how much lava does.

02:13:51.509 --> 02:13:52.896
MATT: Here we go.
MARISHA: Gonna be one us.

02:13:52.896 --> 02:13:55.416
One of us a campaign, got to fall in lava, right?

02:13:55.416 --> 02:13:56.491
SAM: Mm-hmm.

02:13:59.106 --> 02:14:00.989
TRAVIS: How many is it?

02:14:00.989 --> 02:14:02.319
LAURA: 20d10, I'm fucked.
MARISHA: He's picking up

02:14:02.319 --> 02:14:03.579
so many dice!
TALIESIN: How many diamonds

02:14:03.579 --> 02:14:06.269
am I going to have to burn if we survive this?

02:14:06.269 --> 02:14:07.649
LIAM: I can do one.

02:14:07.649 --> 02:14:09.379
MATT: You're not submerged in it.

02:14:09.379 --> 02:14:10.306
LAURA: Right, right, right.

02:14:10.306 --> 02:14:12.139
I'm on the edge of it.

02:14:12.139 --> 02:14:14.742
MATT: So it's not the worst it could be.

02:14:16.289 --> 02:14:17.149
Unless you stay in it.

02:14:17.149 --> 02:14:18.609
TRAVIS: What are you rolling?

02:14:18.609 --> 02:14:19.442
MATT: 5d10.

02:14:19.442 --> 02:14:20.296
TRAVIS: 5d10.
TALIESIN: Oh, okay!

02:14:20.296 --> 02:14:21.129
MARISHA: 5d10.

02:14:21.129 --> 02:14:22.269
MATT: Because you just fell into it.

02:14:22.269 --> 02:14:23.102
LAURA: Okay!

02:14:27.486 --> 02:14:28.719
TRAVIS: That's not a great face.

02:14:31.459 --> 02:14:32.691
MATT: 41 points of fire damage.

02:14:32.691 --> 02:14:34.192
TALIESIN: That's pretty fucking bad.

02:14:34.192 --> 02:14:35.279
SAM: That's a good roll.
LIAM: High roll.

02:14:35.279 --> 02:14:36.945
LAURA: Cool, cool, cool.
MATT: I rolled really well on that.

02:14:36.945 --> 02:14:39.111
LAURA: Yeah, you did. Yeah, you really, really did.

02:14:39.961 --> 02:14:41.355
MARISHA: Almost max.

02:14:41.355 --> 02:14:42.269
LAURA: Do I have any movement left?

02:14:42.269 --> 02:14:44.999
Can I get out of the lava with that?

02:14:44.999 --> 02:14:46.069
MATT: With that--

02:14:47.159 --> 02:14:48.342
LAURA: That was just a jump.

02:14:48.342 --> 02:14:49.359
MATT: That was a jump.

02:14:49.359 --> 02:14:50.569
I'd say, because you just fell in

02:14:50.569 --> 02:14:52.519
you've managed to get yourself one step out,

02:14:52.519 --> 02:14:55.065
but that's as far as you can get right there

02:14:55.065 --> 02:14:56.799
and you are on fire because you fell in the lava.

02:14:56.799 --> 02:14:57.632
LAURA: Right, right.

02:14:57.632 --> 02:14:59.712
Cool. Tight.

02:14:59.712 --> 02:15:01.215
TALIESIN: Do I have fucking anything?

02:15:04.339 --> 02:15:05.964
LAURA: Cool. Then--

02:15:07.009 --> 02:15:09.399
I can't get close enough to do any melee,

02:15:09.399 --> 02:15:11.599
so I'm just going to use--

02:15:11.599 --> 02:15:13.543
MATT: If you wanted to tumble out this direction,

02:15:13.543 --> 02:15:14.517
because you were going for the melee

02:15:14.517 --> 02:15:16.369
I could let you stumble out into melee with it

02:15:16.369 --> 02:15:18.629
because it's either adjacent or to the side.

02:15:18.629 --> 02:15:20.809
Since that was your intent, I'll let you do that.

02:15:20.809 --> 02:15:21.642
LAURA: Okay.

02:15:22.969 --> 02:15:23.802
Cool.

02:15:24.989 --> 02:15:26.639
I'll do more damage with my cantrips,

02:15:26.639 --> 02:15:28.289
so I'm going to stay next to it,

02:15:28.289 --> 02:15:31.069
but I'm going to do a Sacred Flame up on it.

02:15:31.069 --> 02:15:31.902
MATT: Okay.

02:15:33.359 --> 02:15:35.248
That is going to be a 14.

02:15:35.248 --> 02:15:36.463
LAURA: Okay.

02:15:36.463 --> 02:15:38.363
Okay, okay.

02:15:40.865 --> 02:15:41.698
A d8.

02:15:46.052 --> 02:15:49.289
17 points of radiant damage?

02:15:49.289 --> 02:15:50.122
MATT: Nice.

02:15:51.259 --> 02:15:52.319
It's looking real tough.

02:15:52.319 --> 02:15:54.479
As you strike it, the flames burn around it.

02:15:54.479 --> 02:15:57.759
The radiance mingling with the actual elemental fire inside

02:15:57.759 --> 02:15:59.879
and you could see it having to reform itself

02:15:59.879 --> 02:16:01.325
and fall and then reform.

02:16:01.325 --> 02:16:04.343
It's having a difficult time keeping itself corporeal.

02:16:04.343 --> 02:16:06.496
LAURA: And I'm just looking at it real angry and I say:

02:16:06.496 --> 02:16:07.686
Fight me!

02:16:08.599 --> 02:16:09.669
MATT: Okay.

02:16:09.669 --> 02:16:11.849
Finishing your go, it's its turn.

02:16:11.849 --> 02:16:13.569
Top of the round.

02:16:13.569 --> 02:16:17.189
It has to make a wisdom save against your Spirit Guardians.

02:16:17.189 --> 02:16:18.362
That is going to be a seven.

02:16:18.362 --> 02:16:20.242
TALIESIN: That does not save.

02:16:21.289 --> 02:16:22.789
That's a--

02:16:22.789 --> 02:16:25.322
That's the wrong die, that would've really sucked.

02:16:28.179 --> 02:16:29.189
10--

02:16:30.370 --> 02:16:31.979
15.
MARISHA: Kill it.

02:16:31.979 --> 02:16:32.865
MATT: How do you want to do this?

02:16:32.865 --> 02:16:35.219
(cheering)
TRAVIS: Yes!

02:16:35.219 --> 02:16:37.209
TALIESIN: I'm having a really bad time.

02:16:37.209 --> 02:16:38.112
I breathe deep.

02:16:39.539 --> 02:16:41.139
And I just start stepping towards it

02:16:41.139 --> 02:16:44.359
and the circle starts--

02:16:44.359 --> 02:16:48.389
the insects start plowing into it like in The Mummy

02:16:48.389 --> 02:16:50.302
and it's just beetles trying to devour it.

02:16:50.302 --> 02:16:51.999
They're burning up as they go,

02:16:51.999 --> 02:16:52.989
but they just keep going.

02:16:52.989 --> 02:16:55.019
The circle is just dissipating into it.

02:16:55.019 --> 02:16:57.152
MATT: As you watch the cloud

02:16:57.152 --> 02:16:59.659
of beetles and insects swarm it,

02:16:59.659 --> 02:17:02.449
you see them burning and popping, these flashes of light,

02:17:02.449 --> 02:17:03.769
but the more that pour into it,

02:17:03.769 --> 02:17:07.279
the darker the flame gets, the more it begins to suffocate

02:17:07.279 --> 02:17:09.419
the source of its own life fire.

02:17:09.419 --> 02:17:11.799
As it begins to slightly sigh out

02:17:11.799 --> 02:17:13.625
this horrible wheezing death cry.

02:17:13.625 --> 02:17:16.429
(raspy howling)

02:17:16.429 --> 02:17:19.159
You watch as all the light grows dark,

02:17:19.159 --> 02:17:21.439
the cloud fully encompassing and smothering it

02:17:21.439 --> 02:17:23.749
before they eventually dissipate,

02:17:23.749 --> 02:17:25.149
leaving nothing but a pile of ash

02:17:25.149 --> 02:17:27.299
and a couple of stones where it once stood.

02:17:31.919 --> 02:17:34.679
As you all sit in this moment,

02:17:34.679 --> 02:17:39.449
this moment of quiet, intense

02:17:42.689 --> 02:17:44.009
realization,

02:17:45.741 --> 02:17:46.574
We're going to take a break.

02:17:46.574 --> 02:17:48.269
SAM and TALIESIN: Ugh.

02:17:48.269 --> 02:17:49.119
MATT: Back here in a few minutes

02:17:49.119 --> 02:17:50.982
to pick up at the end of this battle.

02:17:52.769 --> 02:17:53.602
Oh boy!

02:17:54.461 --> 02:17:56.222
See you guys here in a few minutes.

02:17:58.077 --> 02:18:01.410
(mellow cheerful music)

02:19:09.054 --> 02:19:11.804
(dramatic music)

02:19:13.686 --> 02:19:15.686
Narrator: Dwarvenite.

02:19:16.345 --> 02:19:20.357
The most precious substance among Dwarven smiths.

02:19:22.284 --> 02:19:27.108
Able to absorb the very spirit of the craftsman.

02:19:32.381 --> 02:19:37.617
Thus infused, it becomes nearly indestructible,

02:19:39.619 --> 02:19:43.937
able to forge heirlooms that will last for generations.

02:19:45.595 --> 02:19:47.659
(grunting)

02:19:47.659 --> 02:19:50.242
(metal clinks)

02:19:54.085 --> 02:19:57.009
Pure Dwarvenite.

02:19:57.034 --> 02:20:02.034
Now you can get your hands on this legendary substance,

02:20:02.044 --> 02:20:06.137
with the new Dungeon of Doom.

02:20:06.162 --> 02:20:12.477
Available now at dwarvenforge.com.

02:20:15.881 --> 02:20:18.654
I wasn't lying when I just blue-screened.

02:20:18.654 --> 02:20:20.854
Oh no.
(laughter)

02:20:20.854 --> 02:20:23.674
Dani, we should be apologizing to you.

02:20:23.674 --> 02:20:25.024
Let's be honest.

02:20:25.024 --> 02:20:27.984
The story was so dense, I'm so sorry.

02:20:27.984 --> 02:20:30.831
That was so bad that it kicked Ashley off our Zoom call?

02:20:30.831 --> 02:20:31.823
It did!
Yeah, apparently.

02:20:31.823 --> 02:20:34.842
Ashley's gone and she's next.

02:20:34.842 --> 02:20:38.220
Oh no!
(laughter)

02:20:38.220 --> 02:20:41.664
Should we stop for technical difficulties to get her back?

02:20:41.664 --> 02:20:42.497
I mean we can probably vamp --

02:20:42.497 --> 02:20:44.860
It jettisoned her out of this timeline.

02:20:44.860 --> 02:20:46.414
I don't know.

02:20:46.414 --> 02:20:48.304
She doesn't have to witness her own shame.

02:20:48.304 --> 02:20:49.274
This is her best timeline.

02:20:49.274 --> 02:20:53.184
I want her to witness her own shame. There's a joy in it.

02:20:53.184 --> 02:20:54.134
Yeah.

02:20:54.134 --> 02:20:56.801
(playful music)

02:21:11.280 --> 02:21:14.197
(mysterious music)

02:21:16.309 --> 02:21:19.309
(typewriter noises)

02:21:41.364 --> 02:21:43.474
Hey, Critters, Laura Bailey here.

02:21:43.474 --> 02:21:45.877
Let's see what's up in the Critical Role shop.

02:21:48.264 --> 02:21:50.894
Oh my gosh. It's so amazing.

02:21:53.657 --> 02:21:56.424
I mean, the Traveler always says impulse purchases

02:21:56.424 --> 02:21:57.647
are a good decision.

02:21:59.834 --> 02:22:02.067
Go ahead darling, treat yourself.

02:22:06.054 --> 02:22:08.611
The cuteness! It's overpowering.

02:22:12.264 --> 02:22:14.357
It's so cute. I can't handle it.

02:22:16.404 --> 02:22:18.946
So click on over to the Critical Role Shop.

02:22:18.946 --> 02:22:21.154
Don't worry, there's a few more minutes in the break.

02:22:21.154 --> 02:22:22.254
You've still got time.

02:22:27.537 --> 02:22:29.287
(grunting)

02:22:29.287 --> 02:22:34.287
Huh (laughs) would you look at that? I think it worked.

02:22:34.624 --> 02:22:36.541
You were right, Pumat Number Three.

02:22:36.541 --> 02:22:39.554
All we had to do was invoke that Subscription Cantrip.

02:22:40.721 --> 02:22:42.027
Pumat Number Three?

02:22:45.094 --> 02:22:45.927
Oh boy.

02:22:45.927 --> 02:22:47.464
Well, hello there!

02:22:47.464 --> 02:22:48.954
I am Pumat Prime.

02:22:48.954 --> 02:22:52.954
It's good to finally join you here in the prime dimension.

02:22:52.954 --> 02:22:56.974
I see this as the Twitch Prime realm, I think?

02:22:56.974 --> 02:23:01.431
And oh, we're on the Critical Role channel, aren't we!

02:23:01.431 --> 02:23:05.204
Would you look at that, you got chat and everything.

02:23:05.204 --> 02:23:08.874
Respectfully, I was looking for the prime rib realm,

02:23:08.874 --> 02:23:11.564
but eh, this isn't too bad.

02:23:11.564 --> 02:23:13.804
You see, if you already have access

02:23:13.804 --> 02:23:16.874
to the Amazon Prime realm, you can get a free subscription

02:23:16.874 --> 02:23:19.724
to the channel of your choice in the Twitch Prime realm.

02:23:19.724 --> 02:23:22.554
The two realms have a pretty good working relationship

02:23:22.554 --> 02:23:25.054
after that peace treaty the prime minister signed

02:23:25.054 --> 02:23:26.654
a few years back.

02:23:26.654 --> 02:23:29.284
You just have to remember to renew your Twitch

02:23:29.284 --> 02:23:32.414
Prime subscription to the top of each month, respectfully.

02:23:32.414 --> 02:23:35.120
And hey, if you're already a subscriber

02:23:35.120 --> 02:23:37.994
you can spread the joy by gifting a subscription

02:23:37.994 --> 02:23:40.744
using the Gift A Sub button,

02:23:40.744 --> 02:23:43.834
that is assuming the Empire hasn't sent the tax man

02:23:43.834 --> 02:23:45.443
to your shop here recently.

02:23:45.443 --> 02:23:47.844
(nervous laughter)

02:23:47.844 --> 02:23:49.184
All right, well, off to find

02:23:49.184 --> 02:23:51.534
that darn elusive prime rib realm.

02:23:51.534 --> 02:23:54.043
Who knew the prime dimension had so many pockets?

02:23:54.043 --> 02:23:55.947
(smacks lips) Good luck!

02:23:58.508 --> 02:24:03.238
Pumat Three?

02:24:03.238 --> 02:24:06.889
[Voiceover] Subscribe.

02:24:06.889 --> 02:24:07.889
Resubscribe.

02:24:10.184 --> 02:24:13.687
Brian Foster is not a cabbage.

02:37:31.368 --> 02:37:33.168
MATT: And welcome back.

02:37:33.168 --> 02:37:36.988
So, as we left off,

02:37:36.988 --> 02:37:41.238
the group that currently resides in this odd sanctum,

02:37:41.238 --> 02:37:46.098
in this realm of flame and ash and blackened cloud

02:37:47.958 --> 02:37:51.728
accidentally called a guardian of the sanctum

02:37:52.948 --> 02:37:55.871
and some collateral damage has come to light.

02:37:57.348 --> 02:38:02.348
So, in that tense moment, what do you do?

02:38:02.628 --> 02:38:04.768
SAM: Jester, Caduceus, somebody,

02:38:04.768 --> 02:38:06.928
I need help now!
TALIESIN: I run over.

02:38:06.928 --> 02:38:08.778
LAURA: I try running over and I fall down

02:38:08.778 --> 02:38:12.209
because my feet are burned to crispies.

02:38:12.209 --> 02:38:14.098
SAM: Someone!
TALIESIN: I see what's happening.

02:38:14.098 --> 02:38:15.901
I'm going to immediately stabilize.

02:38:17.048 --> 02:38:19.578
And then I'm going to pull out a diamond.

02:38:19.578 --> 02:38:21.368
MATT: Stabilize in what way?

02:38:21.368 --> 02:38:22.918
TALIESIN: Hold the...

02:38:22.918 --> 02:38:23.958
Stop the...

02:38:24.971 --> 02:38:27.068
MATT: The timer?
TALIESIN: Yeah, stop the timer.

02:38:27.068 --> 02:38:27.901
SAM: What's it called?

02:38:27.901 --> 02:38:29.788
LAURA: Gentle Repose.
TALIESIN: Gentle Repose.

02:38:29.788 --> 02:38:30.838
Pull out the diamond.

02:38:32.008 --> 02:38:33.488
SAM: Can you do this?

02:38:33.488 --> 02:38:34.321
TALIESIN: (shushes)

02:38:35.998 --> 02:38:39.698
TALIESIN: I start the spell and just--

02:38:39.698 --> 02:38:42.813
the insects pour out and just start to cover.

02:38:42.813 --> 02:38:46.048
And the molds and the fungus just start to cover

02:38:46.048 --> 02:38:48.761
and I'm just going to sit.

02:38:49.748 --> 02:38:52.348
MATT: How do you call the Wild Mother to aid you in this?

02:39:00.084 --> 02:39:01.167
TALIESIN: Wild Mother,

02:39:03.538 --> 02:39:06.205
it is not yet time for this one.

02:39:07.698 --> 02:39:09.621
His destiny has not been fulfilled.

02:39:10.538 --> 02:39:12.011
His time here is not over.

02:39:13.498 --> 02:39:17.141
I beg you, let him have another breath.

02:39:27.954 --> 02:39:29.131
MATT: (rolls die)

02:39:29.131 --> 02:39:29.964
LAURA: (gasps)

02:39:36.018 --> 02:39:37.018
MATT: As you finish your

02:39:38.688 --> 02:39:41.461
final moment of prayer in that sentence,

02:39:42.824 --> 02:39:46.736
the breath that's still in your lungs exhales.

02:39:50.798 --> 02:39:53.328
As it leaves your mouth,

02:39:53.328 --> 02:39:57.226
you hope that breath finds its way into this child.

02:39:59.338 --> 02:40:03.041
The buzz of the insects fades.

02:40:05.178 --> 02:40:10.141
The moss and fungus begins to gray and crumble.

02:40:15.458 --> 02:40:16.501
And you just feel.

02:40:18.948 --> 02:40:20.251
Feel for anything.

02:40:28.378 --> 02:40:30.711
And you feel his chest rise.

02:40:32.218 --> 02:40:33.051
And fall.

02:40:36.018 --> 02:40:39.248
And as the moss and fungus

02:40:39.248 --> 02:40:43.828
that began to encase his burned skin,

02:40:43.828 --> 02:40:47.998
causing Yeza to instinctually begin to grow nervous,

02:40:47.998 --> 02:40:50.928
but then stop as he trusts in the process,

02:40:50.928 --> 02:40:52.938
as it grays and crumbles away

02:40:52.938 --> 02:40:55.601
you can see the skin restored.

02:41:00.538 --> 02:41:01.441
His eyes open.

02:41:10.243 --> 02:41:11.301
"Mom?"

02:41:12.358 --> 02:41:14.798
SAM: (sigh of relief)

02:41:14.798 --> 02:41:19.798
I just hold him and kiss his eyes and kiss his nose.

02:41:21.738 --> 02:41:23.856
TALIESIN: I put Cure Wounds and back up.

02:41:23.856 --> 02:41:26.098
SAM: (stammers) You're okay?

02:41:26.098 --> 02:41:27.051
Are you in pain?

02:41:28.458 --> 02:41:32.231
MATT: "Yeah, I heard a loud whooshing sound.

02:41:37.559 --> 02:41:39.858
"I'm not strong like you, Mom."

02:41:39.858 --> 02:41:40.818
SAM: What are you talking about?

02:41:40.818 --> 02:41:42.068
Of course you're strong!

02:41:48.478 --> 02:41:50.348
Can you move your little fingers?

02:41:50.348 --> 02:41:51.208
Can you stand up?

02:41:51.208 --> 02:41:52.201
Are you okay?

02:41:54.728 --> 02:41:56.958
Just move your legs, move your feet.

02:41:56.958 --> 02:41:59.395
TALIESIN: I would keep it very gentle for a while.

02:41:59.395 --> 02:42:00.848
SAM: Of course.

02:42:00.848 --> 02:42:03.018
MATT: You see him-- he's moving his fingers and legs.

02:42:03.018 --> 02:42:06.318
There is a stiffness to them, and you see--

02:42:08.098 --> 02:42:10.828
The magic of life restoration

02:42:12.118 --> 02:42:14.838
takes a little bit to get there.

02:42:14.838 --> 02:42:15.978
SAM: I'm so sorry.

02:42:15.978 --> 02:42:18.541
I-- I'm so sorry, Luc.

02:42:21.358 --> 02:42:22.191
I'm so sorry.

02:42:22.191 --> 02:42:24.461
I'm just going to keep holding him.

02:42:25.484 --> 02:42:26.803
MATT: He's just holds you and goes,

02:42:26.803 --> 02:42:28.588
"It's okay, Mom.

02:42:28.588 --> 02:42:29.421
"It's okay.

02:42:33.018 --> 02:42:34.385
"You did save me."

02:42:39.808 --> 02:42:42.799
Marion just pulls you close and,

02:42:44.616 --> 02:42:45.691
"Can I help you?"

02:42:45.691 --> 02:42:48.068
LAURA: Oh, I'm fine, Mama.

02:42:48.068 --> 02:42:51.778
MATT: And she gets down and starts going towards your boots

02:42:51.778 --> 02:42:54.728
and goes through the satchel

02:42:54.728 --> 02:42:55.958
that she had thrown together

02:42:55.958 --> 02:42:57.648
and begins taking out some ointments

02:42:57.648 --> 02:43:00.579
and begins to tend to your feet.

02:43:00.579 --> 02:43:01.558
LAURA: Thank you.

02:43:01.558 --> 02:43:04.683
It's really-- seriously, it's okay.

02:43:04.683 --> 02:43:06.039
I'll get it fixed.

02:43:07.768 --> 02:43:11.181
I reach up and grab Caduceus' hand.

02:43:12.113 --> 02:43:13.871
TALIESIN: Hey.

02:43:13.871 --> 02:43:15.218
I'm sitting down.

02:43:15.218 --> 02:43:16.051
LAURA: You.

02:43:17.918 --> 02:43:19.048
You did so good.

02:43:21.216 --> 02:43:25.058
TALIESIN: I think a nap would be nice.

02:43:25.058 --> 02:43:27.058
MATT: You feel a hand grasp your other hand.

02:43:27.968 --> 02:43:31.128
You look over to the opposite side of Jester,

02:43:31.128 --> 02:43:35.328
and looking directly into your eyes,

02:43:35.328 --> 02:43:39.348
tears now drying against his cheeks

02:43:39.348 --> 02:43:43.804
in the heated interior of this chamber, Yeza goes,

02:43:47.035 --> 02:43:48.301
"Thank you.

02:43:51.775 --> 02:43:55.035
"I don't think I can ever express my gratitude."

02:43:59.826 --> 02:44:02.076
TALIESIN: It's all in a day's work.

02:44:07.009 --> 02:44:08.548
It's worth or everything and more.

02:44:08.548 --> 02:44:09.562
Oh, I'm tired.

02:44:09.562 --> 02:44:11.645
(coughs)

02:44:13.285 --> 02:44:16.144
MATT: He squeezes your hand and nods.

02:44:16.144 --> 02:44:19.118
TALIESIN: You've got-- you've--

02:44:19.118 --> 02:44:20.888
It's all good.
MATT: Wipes the snot from his nose

02:44:20.888 --> 02:44:23.044
and goes and joins you,

02:44:23.044 --> 02:44:25.588
just putting his arms around both you and Luc

02:44:25.588 --> 02:44:27.568
and just all three of you sit there

02:44:27.568 --> 02:44:30.701
and hold each other.

02:44:36.128 --> 02:44:37.461
SAM: Are you hurt, too?

02:44:39.399 --> 02:44:42.119
MATT: "I-- I'm okay."

02:44:45.648 --> 02:44:48.111
SAM: That was unexpected.

02:44:49.688 --> 02:44:50.521
MATT: "Yeah."

02:44:53.028 --> 02:44:54.431
SAM: And horrible.

02:44:58.478 --> 02:44:59.311
Um.

02:45:00.978 --> 02:45:01.811
I...

02:45:04.328 --> 02:45:07.028
Wow, I-I-I don't know what to say other than

02:45:08.452 --> 02:45:10.998
I'm so happy that you're okay.

02:45:10.998 --> 02:45:11.831
Both of you.

02:45:13.108 --> 02:45:13.941
MATT: "Me, too."

02:45:13.941 --> 02:45:16.871
And he puts his fingers through Luc's hair.

02:45:26.498 --> 02:45:31.498
"Whoever these people are that are putting us through this."

02:45:38.092 --> 02:45:39.908
He looks over at the rest of you and goes,

02:45:39.908 --> 02:45:42.275
"This is the Assembly again, isn't it?"

02:45:45.078 --> 02:45:45.911
SAM: Yeah.

02:45:51.825 --> 02:45:55.625
MATT: "They've been a shadow over this family for too long."

02:46:06.108 --> 02:46:08.611
He reaches out and takes the necklace he's holding.

02:46:10.378 --> 02:46:12.478
Takes Luc's head and holds it there,

02:46:12.478 --> 02:46:15.548
and you can see Luc--

02:46:15.548 --> 02:46:18.548
the brave face is fading a bit and he's just

02:46:20.338 --> 02:46:23.548
leaning into the proximity and the comfort

02:46:23.548 --> 02:46:25.898
as he processes what he's been through.

02:46:28.801 --> 02:46:30.068
As Yeza clutches the necklace

02:46:30.068 --> 02:46:32.135
and looks at you and says, "These--

02:46:34.135 --> 02:46:37.218
"Once we're out of whatever this hellscape is,

02:46:37.218 --> 02:46:40.698
"these will keep us safe from them, right?"

02:46:40.698 --> 02:46:41.588
SAM: Yes.

02:46:41.588 --> 02:46:42.941
Once we get out of here,

02:46:44.448 --> 02:46:47.301
they can't see us anymore or follow us.

02:46:52.308 --> 02:46:54.050
MATT: "Will you make them pay for this?"

02:46:59.488 --> 02:47:00.756
SAM: They'll pay.

02:47:04.438 --> 02:47:05.579
MATT: "Good.

02:47:10.812 --> 02:47:13.451
"I love you."

02:47:13.451 --> 02:47:14.871
SAM: I love you, too.

02:47:16.718 --> 02:47:18.719
And Luc,

02:47:21.048 --> 02:47:23.348
as much ice cream as you want

02:47:23.348 --> 02:47:25.488
as soon as we're free and clear.

02:47:25.488 --> 02:47:27.658
MATT: (as Yeza) "Yeah."
SAM: Like, all of it

02:47:27.658 --> 02:47:31.028
until you throw up and then we'll just get you more.

02:47:31.028 --> 02:47:34.208
MATT: You can see Luc, his eyes were closed,

02:47:34.208 --> 02:47:36.838
head against your sternum

02:47:36.838 --> 02:47:39.251
and immediately, "Really!"

02:47:39.251 --> 02:47:41.078
SAM: Yeah, yeah. Any flavor.

02:47:41.078 --> 02:47:43.158
MATT: He looks to Yeza waiting for the father to weigh in

02:47:43.158 --> 02:47:47.141
and Yeza goes, "Yeah, sure.

02:47:48.748 --> 02:47:52.718
"You've got to not hold yourself back

02:47:52.718 --> 02:47:54.352
"from enjoying the moments."

02:47:54.352 --> 02:47:55.185
SAM: Mm-hmm.

02:47:57.458 --> 02:47:58.291
MATT: "Right?"

02:48:01.768 --> 02:48:02.804
And Luc nods.

02:48:04.008 --> 02:48:04.841
"Right.

02:48:08.381 --> 02:48:09.848
"Did you get them?"

02:48:10.778 --> 02:48:11.791
SAM: Oh yeah, we did.

02:48:12.748 --> 02:48:17.471
Yeah. Whatever that thing was, it's gone.

02:48:18.330 --> 02:48:19.280
MATT: "I knew you would."

02:48:21.766 --> 02:48:23.066
And he just starts crying.

02:48:24.998 --> 02:48:25.831
SAM: Me, too.

02:48:32.828 --> 02:48:36.798
LIAM: I think during all of those low conversations

02:48:36.798 --> 02:48:38.251
in this quiet cavern,

02:48:39.518 --> 02:48:44.381
Caleb would be feeling pretty fucking shameful,

02:48:46.408 --> 02:48:48.208
particularly after hearing most of that

02:48:48.208 --> 02:48:52.628
and has already wandered to the entrance to this chamber

02:48:52.628 --> 02:48:56.308
and sends Frumpkin off about 90 feet down,

02:48:56.308 --> 02:48:58.128
just to listen for me.

02:48:58.128 --> 02:49:01.028
And he just goes about putting the dome up

02:49:01.028 --> 02:49:03.608
in the mouth of the tunnel

02:49:03.608 --> 02:49:06.675
to make the cork that he started earlier.

02:49:06.675 --> 02:49:07.508
MATT: Okay.

02:49:14.018 --> 02:49:16.068
It seems like you're in a somewhat safe space

02:49:16.068 --> 02:49:18.518
now that whatever was the guardian of the sanctum

02:49:20.478 --> 02:49:22.228
is no longer a threat.

02:49:22.228 --> 02:49:23.618
You can take the time to rest

02:49:23.618 --> 02:49:25.998
and go about any other business or conversation you'd like

02:49:25.998 --> 02:49:29.738
while you await your time-stretched allies

02:49:29.738 --> 02:49:31.403
to return from their venture.

02:49:31.403 --> 02:49:32.901
TALIESIN: Who's hurt bad?

02:49:35.543 --> 02:49:37.121
LAURA: I'm hurt pretty bad.

02:49:39.118 --> 02:49:40.628
SAM: You're not on fire anymore, right?

02:49:40.628 --> 02:49:42.228
LAURA: I put my feet out,

02:49:42.228 --> 02:49:45.251
but a couple of my toes are gone.

02:49:46.158 --> 02:49:48.168
TALIESIN: Veth, how are you doing?

02:49:48.168 --> 02:49:49.668
SAM: You already healed me pretty well.

02:49:49.668 --> 02:49:51.638
TALIESIN: Okay. I'm going to--

02:49:51.638 --> 02:49:53.463
One, two,

02:49:55.296 --> 02:49:57.162
three, four, five, six.

02:49:57.162 --> 02:49:58.548
Okay, so I'm just going to sit

02:49:58.548 --> 02:50:00.738
and just start casting Prayer of Healing

02:50:00.738 --> 02:50:03.928
after Prayer of Healing for the next,

02:50:03.928 --> 02:50:04.858
I'm just going to meditate

02:50:04.858 --> 02:50:07.549
and slowly everybody's going to get a little better.

02:50:07.549 --> 02:50:08.382
MATT: Okay.

02:50:12.938 --> 02:50:14.998
TALIESIN: 20 for the first round.

02:50:14.998 --> 02:50:16.748
Everyone gets 20 heals, 20 points,

02:50:16.748 --> 02:50:18.271
including all the NPCs.

02:50:19.628 --> 02:50:20.655
Except Veth.

02:50:20.655 --> 02:50:22.196
LAURA: What's an NPC?

02:50:23.229 --> 02:50:25.478
LIAM: What was the total on that?

02:50:25.478 --> 02:50:28.478
TALIESIN: Normal people communicating.

02:50:28.478 --> 02:50:29.311
20.

02:50:29.311 --> 02:50:30.538
And then the next round

02:50:33.508 --> 02:50:34.431
is 13.

02:50:36.888 --> 02:50:39.478
LAURA: After Caleb finishes the dome--

02:50:40.448 --> 02:50:42.563
TALIESIN: I'll keep doing this for a bit.

02:50:42.563 --> 02:50:45.076
LAURA: I'm going to go over to Caleb.

02:50:47.028 --> 02:50:48.011
You should rest.

02:50:49.608 --> 02:50:50.441
LIAM: Oh.

02:50:52.493 --> 02:50:53.326
Yeah.

02:50:56.588 --> 02:51:00.978
Before that, would you help me with something?

02:51:00.978 --> 02:51:01.978
LAURA: Of course.

02:51:03.458 --> 02:51:06.738
LIAM: And he pulls out the collar

02:51:06.738 --> 02:51:08.538
that he's been working on privately.

02:51:10.688 --> 02:51:14.208
I have been tinkering with this for quite some time

02:51:14.208 --> 02:51:17.538
and I'm having trouble with it.

02:51:17.538 --> 02:51:19.778
It might need more than one set of hands.

02:51:19.778 --> 02:51:24.153
Every time I try to insert this,

02:51:24.153 --> 02:51:26.111
I mess it up.

02:51:27.978 --> 02:51:31.978
If I hold the collar itself,

02:51:31.978 --> 02:51:34.808
would you try to get it into--

02:51:34.808 --> 02:51:38.468
the casing is here and there was a ridge along the edge,

02:51:38.468 --> 02:51:41.268
but you have to be very careful with that

02:51:41.268 --> 02:51:43.578
because it could shatter and I only have one.

02:51:43.578 --> 02:51:45.638
And I need this so that--

02:51:47.808 --> 02:51:49.081
Anyway.
LAURA: So that what?

02:51:51.338 --> 02:51:54.188
This looks like a collar you put around someone's neck.

02:51:54.188 --> 02:51:55.378
LIAM: It is.

02:51:55.378 --> 02:51:57.801
LAURA: So who do you plan on putting this collar on?

02:52:02.728 --> 02:52:04.821
LIAM: My old teacher.

02:52:11.738 --> 02:52:14.561
LAURA: Wow. That would be really cool.

02:52:16.777 --> 02:52:20.208
I don't know if it's really his style, but...

02:52:20.208 --> 02:52:21.579
LIAM: It will be soon.

02:52:24.258 --> 02:52:26.901
I can't let what happened in here be for nothing.

02:52:30.348 --> 02:52:33.338
It's time for him to be silenced.

02:52:33.338 --> 02:52:34.171
LAURA: Yeah.

02:52:35.878 --> 02:52:38.711
LIAM: So I will hold it,

02:52:39.748 --> 02:52:41.318
and if you could try to--

02:52:44.008 --> 02:52:44.841
Careful.

02:52:48.398 --> 02:52:51.028
LAURA: I guess I will try to put it in.

02:52:51.028 --> 02:52:51.861
MATT: Okay.

02:52:53.968 --> 02:52:56.388
LAURA: Can I cast Guidance on myself

02:52:56.388 --> 02:52:58.288
as I'm trying to do this?
MATT: You can.

02:52:59.368 --> 02:53:01.418
Go ahead and attempt a dexterity check.

02:53:02.650 --> 02:53:04.338
LAURA: (high-pitched scared noises)

02:53:04.338 --> 02:53:06.505
LIAM: Wait, wait, wait.

02:53:06.505 --> 02:53:07.728
Set it down, set it down.

02:53:11.298 --> 02:53:12.778
Okay.

02:53:12.778 --> 02:53:14.948
I pull out one of the pearls

02:53:14.948 --> 02:53:18.636
that I purchased in Rexxentrum

02:53:18.636 --> 02:53:21.111
and I place it against your forehead

02:53:21.111 --> 02:53:22.898
and my free hand begins to trace

02:53:23.878 --> 02:53:25.798
geometric patterns around it.

02:53:25.798 --> 02:53:27.511
And you see those in your mind.

02:53:30.038 --> 02:53:32.188
Okay. Now we try.

02:53:32.188 --> 02:53:33.021
LAURA: Okay.

02:53:38.548 --> 02:53:39.848
Which one? (chuckles)

02:53:45.468 --> 02:53:47.051
That's pretty good.

02:53:49.485 --> 02:53:51.652
That first one was better.

02:53:54.288 --> 02:53:56.111
I'm looking for my fours!

02:53:59.858 --> 02:54:00.741
Dexterity?

02:54:05.528 --> 02:54:06.361
23.

02:54:08.708 --> 02:54:12.918
MATT: Now, you've worked quite a bit on this device

02:54:12.918 --> 02:54:14.988
and it's confounded you in certain places,

02:54:14.988 --> 02:54:17.218
but you've eventually managed to maneuver past

02:54:17.218 --> 02:54:18.128
some of these challenges.

02:54:18.128 --> 02:54:20.815
LAURA: Ooh, and I can use my jeweler's--

02:54:22.195 --> 02:54:24.262
I don't have jeweler's tools. (laughs)

02:54:24.262 --> 02:54:26.641
(laughter)
LIAM: As you were.

02:54:29.008 --> 02:54:29.841
LAURA: Cool.
MATT: If you had them,

02:54:29.841 --> 02:54:31.661
you could've!
LAURA: I could've!

02:54:33.058 --> 02:54:37.138
MATT: But the placement is so sensitive in this

02:54:37.138 --> 02:54:38.028
without breaking it,

02:54:38.028 --> 02:54:40.078
and there's times you've gotten close,

02:54:40.078 --> 02:54:41.948
but you've not trusted yourself and you've pulled away.

02:54:41.948 --> 02:54:44.187
It's been this constant struggle of

02:54:44.187 --> 02:54:45.587
you've got one shot at this.

02:54:46.468 --> 02:54:48.598
As you carefully look inside,

02:54:48.598 --> 02:54:52.418
your painterly touch, the artistic dexterity

02:54:52.418 --> 02:54:54.848
that you've relied on for most of your life

02:54:54.848 --> 02:54:56.208
comes in extremely handy

02:54:56.208 --> 02:55:01.208
as you expertly place this red gem into the gap.

02:55:02.148 --> 02:55:03.868
As it slides into place,

02:55:03.868 --> 02:55:08.858
you maneuver it to connect all the various converging lines

02:55:08.858 --> 02:55:10.718
of arcane channeling.

02:55:10.718 --> 02:55:13.876
And as it does, the red gem

02:55:13.876 --> 02:55:16.417
(pulse) begins to glow red.

02:55:16.417 --> 02:55:19.078
As it does, you watch as these tiny little bits

02:55:19.078 --> 02:55:23.278
of dull filigree along the outer rim of this claw

02:55:23.278 --> 02:55:25.638
begin to glow that same red color,

02:55:25.638 --> 02:55:28.843
and it hums faintly with arcane energy.

02:55:28.843 --> 02:55:30.323
LAURA: Is it supposed to do that?

02:55:30.323 --> 02:55:31.406
Is that good?

02:55:33.262 --> 02:55:34.095
LIAM: Yeah.

02:55:35.648 --> 02:55:36.552
LAURA: Go, team!

02:55:36.552 --> 02:55:38.802
(giggling)

02:55:40.318 --> 02:55:41.151
LIAM: Thank you.

02:55:41.151 --> 02:55:42.018
LAURA: Of course, yeah.

02:55:43.398 --> 02:55:45.958
LIAM: I am going to need more time with it.

02:55:45.958 --> 02:55:47.698
LAURA: Now you just have to convince him to put it on!

02:55:47.698 --> 02:55:51.986
LIAM: It's like the tenth time that
I've tried to do that, thank you.

02:55:51.986 --> 02:55:53.403
LAURA: You're welcome.

02:55:54.966 --> 02:55:55.966
LIAM: Thank you.

02:56:00.458 --> 02:56:04.931
LAURA: Don't blame yourself for any of this.

02:56:06.608 --> 02:56:11.340
I know it's kind of what you're prone to do, Caleb, but

02:56:14.798 --> 02:56:16.331
this is on all of us.

02:56:18.718 --> 02:56:19.788
We're a family now.

02:56:19.788 --> 02:56:21.301
This is what we do.

02:56:23.998 --> 02:56:25.690
And we're going to make it better.

02:56:28.618 --> 02:56:29.908
LIAM: Reaches his hand out and just sort of

02:56:29.908 --> 02:56:32.108
squeezes the back of her hand on the ground.

02:56:34.788 --> 02:56:37.221
Yeah, I'll keep trying to remind myself of that.

02:56:39.105 --> 02:56:40.288
LAURA: Get some sleep.

02:56:40.288 --> 02:56:43.388
Your dome only stays up for a few hours.

02:56:43.388 --> 02:56:44.325
Take advantage of it.

02:56:44.325 --> 02:56:45.158
LIAM: Okay.

02:56:46.278 --> 02:56:48.988
MATT: At this point you hear the footsteps approach

02:56:48.988 --> 02:56:53.988
of Marion Lavorre, who's been on the periphery,

02:56:55.488 --> 02:56:57.238
listening to part of this and goes,

02:57:00.175 --> 02:57:04.901
"I've been around a bit longer than most of you really.

02:57:07.088 --> 02:57:08.531
"And I've met many people.

02:57:10.728 --> 02:57:13.664
"Some good, some very bad.

02:57:15.648 --> 02:57:17.598
"If there's one thing I've come to know,

02:57:20.248 --> 02:57:21.358
"the good people

02:57:24.288 --> 02:57:29.098
"are easy to be misled to think they're at fault

02:57:30.628 --> 02:57:34.318
"for the things that bad people used to victimize them.

02:57:39.788 --> 02:57:41.188
"It's how they stay in power.

02:57:45.558 --> 02:57:48.258
"If they convince us that we are responsible for

02:57:49.538 --> 02:57:54.231
"every terrible thing that comes upon us, they're absolved.

02:58:00.345 --> 02:58:01.495
"Blame's a tricky thing.

02:58:02.758 --> 02:58:06.539
"And sure, we all have our own guilts that we keep.

02:58:06.539 --> 02:58:08.391
"The gods know I have mine.

02:58:10.168 --> 02:58:15.168
"But I've been told enough times in my life

02:58:18.628 --> 02:58:23.628
"that I am responsible for the bad things that befall me.

02:58:26.313 --> 02:58:28.058
"It's taken me this long to know

02:58:29.228 --> 02:58:30.613
"that that's not true."

02:58:37.488 --> 02:58:41.618
LIAM: Caleb bites his tongue

02:58:42.698 --> 02:58:46.831
and doesn't try to explain or reason away or sidestep.

02:58:47.968 --> 02:58:52.813
and just listens, which is something for him.

02:59:02.086 --> 02:59:04.236
MATT: "We're here now together

02:59:05.960 --> 02:59:10.493
"because you all kept us safe.

02:59:12.708 --> 02:59:14.151
"And if you hadn't done this,

02:59:15.978 --> 02:59:18.178
"who knows how much worse it could have been.

02:59:23.348 --> 02:59:24.181
"So

02:59:26.922 --> 02:59:29.522
"don't forget to focus on the good things you do."

02:59:36.418 --> 02:59:38.458
She puts her hands on your shoulders, Jester,

02:59:38.458 --> 02:59:41.719
and gives a little squeeze and leans against you.

02:59:43.648 --> 02:59:45.818
"This is much more comfortable space to be sitting.

02:59:45.818 --> 02:59:47.758
"Do you mind if we all move into this dome?"

02:59:47.758 --> 02:59:48.778
LIAM: Yes, please.

02:59:48.778 --> 02:59:50.988
MATT: "Of course. (whistles)"
LIAM: It is hot.

02:59:50.988 --> 02:59:52.108
MATT: She gives a notification

02:59:52.108 --> 02:59:55.848
and eventually all of you meander over to the dome.

02:59:55.848 --> 02:59:58.638
Because for each hour spent in this space

02:59:58.638 --> 03:00:01.548
there are progressive constitutional roles to be had,

03:00:01.548 --> 03:00:02.928
but within the dome you don't have to worry about.

03:00:02.928 --> 03:00:04.178
SAM: Oh wow!

03:00:04.178 --> 03:00:06.428
TALIESIN: 37 more hit points to everyone involved as well.

03:00:06.428 --> 03:00:08.888
TRAVIS: Penalty spent in this place, which is the--

03:00:10.899 --> 03:00:13.248
MATT: You can roll an arcana check if you'd like to.

03:00:13.248 --> 03:00:14.588
Anybody can roll and arcana check

03:00:14.588 --> 03:00:16.461
to see if they can figure out where you are.

03:00:17.398 --> 03:00:18.448
TALIESIN: I'll take that bet.

03:00:20.348 --> 03:00:21.548
LIAM: I gotchu, boo.

03:00:22.688 --> 03:00:23.699
30.

03:00:23.699 --> 03:00:25.318
(laughs)

03:00:25.318 --> 03:00:27.541
LAURA: Not as good as my seven, but I guess it'll do.

03:00:27.541 --> 03:00:28.491
TALIESIN: It'll do.

03:00:28.491 --> 03:00:29.608
MATT: Between the two of you.

03:00:30.728 --> 03:00:33.148
Based on the topography that was explained

03:00:33.148 --> 03:00:35.508
beyond this space, the creatures,

03:00:35.508 --> 03:00:36.341
and if you thumb through,

03:00:36.341 --> 03:00:37.174
if you want to thumb through more of the book

03:00:37.174 --> 03:00:38.048
there's more information in there,

03:00:38.048 --> 03:00:38.938
but you got that this is probably

03:00:38.938 --> 03:00:40.338
the Elemental Plane of Fire.

03:00:41.468 --> 03:00:44.988
LIAM: He will spend 20 minutes finally returning to that.

03:00:44.988 --> 03:00:46.538
MATT: Okay. Roll an investigation check.

03:00:46.538 --> 03:00:48.898
LIAM: He'll Comprehend Languages.

03:00:48.898 --> 03:00:49.931
10 minutes later.

03:00:52.548 --> 03:00:53.498
Guidance.

03:00:53.498 --> 03:00:54.998
And it was what kind of check?

03:00:56.348 --> 03:00:57.378
MATT: Investigation.

03:00:57.378 --> 03:01:00.068
LIAM: Oh, okay. Well, good thing investigation is high.

03:01:00.068 --> 03:01:00.901
20.

03:01:00.901 --> 03:01:01.917
MATT: 20. Okay.

03:01:04.318 --> 03:01:06.888
You fall along the same lines

03:01:06.888 --> 03:01:08.851
that Jester had uncovered before.

03:01:09.798 --> 03:01:10.631
Spending more time with it,

03:01:10.631 --> 03:01:12.758
you do finally find a signature of the writer,

03:01:12.758 --> 03:01:15.968
and it says Planerider Ryn.

03:01:15.968 --> 03:01:17.270
LIAM: Ryn?

03:01:17.270 --> 03:01:19.225
LAURA: Planerider? That's so cool!

03:01:19.225 --> 03:01:21.025
TRAVIS: Why does it sound familiar, though?

03:01:21.025 --> 03:01:24.118
MATT: And a symbol not unlike the emblem

03:01:24.118 --> 03:01:26.998
that was encased in glass alongside the scroll

03:01:26.998 --> 03:01:27.948
that sent you here.

03:01:28.828 --> 03:01:30.978
Like an oblong, pointed oval

03:01:30.978 --> 03:01:33.708
with an eye in the center of it.

03:01:33.708 --> 03:01:34.788
MARISHA: Ryn.

03:01:34.788 --> 03:01:36.018
ASHLEY: Ryn?

03:01:36.018 --> 03:01:37.568
MATT: Ryn. R-Y-N.

03:01:37.568 --> 03:01:39.228
MARISHA: R-Y-N.

03:01:39.228 --> 03:01:41.908
LAURA: I got the Y correct.

03:01:41.908 --> 03:01:44.878
MARISHA: I spelled it W-R-E-N.

03:01:44.878 --> 03:01:46.838
Super wrong.

03:01:46.838 --> 03:01:49.885
ASHLEY: Well, I spelled it R-I-N, so I think I was way off.

03:01:49.885 --> 03:01:50.844
(laughter)

03:01:50.844 --> 03:01:52.263
TALIESIN: Planerider Ryan?

03:01:52.263 --> 03:01:55.058
(laughter)

03:01:55.058 --> 03:01:57.688
TALIESIN: Sounds like an off-brand Silver Surfer.

03:01:57.688 --> 03:01:58.688
MATT: In your reading...

03:02:00.038 --> 03:02:02.068
It's interesting, the book's scattered,

03:02:02.068 --> 03:02:03.708
a lot of it's just pontification

03:02:03.708 --> 03:02:08.056
and has a sense of wonder, a sense of curiosity.

03:02:08.056 --> 03:02:12.138
This person-- it reads very much like a science nerd

03:02:12.138 --> 03:02:14.511
really into their trade.

03:02:15.628 --> 03:02:17.398
And you can't help but get excited along with them

03:02:17.398 --> 03:02:18.438
to a certain degree.

03:02:18.438 --> 03:02:21.868
LIAM: He's theorizing about possible disaster, right?

03:02:21.868 --> 03:02:22.701
Wasn't that what you went on?

03:02:22.701 --> 03:02:25.628
MATT: Possible change that could spell disaster or balance?

03:02:25.628 --> 03:02:27.026
Who knows?
LIAM: Okay.

03:02:27.026 --> 03:02:29.568
MATT: Not unlike the--

03:02:29.568 --> 03:02:33.098
For instance, an example theory of the magnetic poles

03:02:33.098 --> 03:02:34.963
suddenly flipping earth.

03:02:34.963 --> 03:02:37.828
There's some sort of something strange

03:02:37.828 --> 03:02:42.188
and you do pick up some of the odd reading that eludes,

03:02:42.188 --> 03:02:46.288
as they note, "I continue to find an aberration in my data

03:02:46.288 --> 03:02:47.808
"pertaining to Exandria.

03:02:47.808 --> 03:02:50.968
"A cyclical, months long, slow surge

03:02:50.968 --> 03:02:52.408
"in low-level magical interference

03:02:52.408 --> 03:02:55.168
"that then recedes just as slowly.

03:02:55.168 --> 03:02:59.098
"Something that tangles my readings and upsets my analysis.

03:02:59.098 --> 03:03:01.568
"It is too faint to identify the arcane nature at source,

03:03:01.568 --> 03:03:03.148
"but I worry if this pertains

03:03:03.148 --> 03:03:05.341
"to the shifting between the veils.

03:03:07.058 --> 03:03:09.668
"Could be something very interesting.

03:03:09.668 --> 03:03:11.018
"Something very frightening.

03:03:11.948 --> 03:03:12.781
"Very wonderful.

03:03:15.538 --> 03:03:16.788
"More tests are required."

03:03:19.438 --> 03:03:21.638
But these are just musings of an individual.

03:03:24.328 --> 03:03:28.851
So you have time to rest within this sanctum.

03:03:29.818 --> 03:03:31.980
LAURA: I'm going to make sure the Happy Fun Ball

03:03:31.980 --> 03:03:36.488
is in a nice safe place so that if they come out of it,

03:03:36.488 --> 03:03:39.148
they're not going to bamf into lava.

03:03:39.148 --> 03:03:41.241
MATT: Good call, good call.

03:03:43.458 --> 03:03:44.291
All right.

03:03:44.291 --> 03:03:45.465
TRAVIS: Hey, we're here-- (screaming)

03:03:45.465 --> 03:03:48.615
(laughter)
TRAVIS: (quiet screaming)

03:03:48.615 --> 03:03:52.398
LIAM: I would summon Frumpkin and send Frumpkin to Luc

03:03:52.398 --> 03:03:56.341
to purr like crazy and just cuddle up.

03:03:57.268 --> 03:04:00.858
And then if we are sleeping, if we're resting,

03:04:00.858 --> 03:04:03.798
then I would curve away from the group

03:04:03.798 --> 03:04:08.118
with my back towards the side of the dome to "go to sleep",

03:04:08.118 --> 03:04:13.118
but I would actually tinker with and examine the collar

03:04:13.558 --> 03:04:15.958
for probably an hour, examining it and trying to

03:04:17.278 --> 03:04:18.858
get my brain wrapped around it further.

03:04:18.858 --> 03:04:20.228
And then pass out.

03:04:20.228 --> 03:04:21.061
MATT: Okay.

03:04:21.061 --> 03:04:22.328
You all taking a long rest?

03:04:22.328 --> 03:04:24.778
LAURA: I'm going to schnuggle with my mama.

03:04:24.778 --> 03:04:27.041
MATT: Okay. She happily accepts.

03:04:28.148 --> 03:04:32.876
And Luc thoroughly enjoys the cat play.

03:04:35.180 --> 03:04:37.348
LAURA: Give me the sleep!

03:04:37.348 --> 03:04:42.248
MATT: As everyone's going to bed and going to sleep,

03:04:42.248 --> 03:04:45.193
Yeza curling up next to you,

03:04:45.193 --> 03:04:47.548
just Luc is sleeping between the two of you,

03:04:47.548 --> 03:04:50.821
once it's quiet, just says,

03:04:52.925 --> 03:04:53.925
"Are you all right?"

03:04:55.278 --> 03:04:56.111
SAM: Me?

03:04:57.898 --> 03:04:58.801
I'm fine.

03:05:02.738 --> 03:05:03.888
No, I'm not.

03:05:03.888 --> 03:05:08.888
I mean, this is the worst thing that could've ever happened.

03:05:09.558 --> 03:05:10.671
And I did it.

03:05:15.178 --> 03:05:16.011
It's--

03:05:18.828 --> 03:05:19.661
You know, I--

03:05:21.438 --> 03:05:24.328
These people are wonderful.

03:05:24.328 --> 03:05:27.111
I feel like they're my family, too, you know?

03:05:28.528 --> 03:05:31.928
But it also feels like if I try to keep one family safe,

03:05:31.928 --> 03:05:33.421
I'm endangering the other.

03:05:35.808 --> 03:05:37.558
I don't know what to do about that.

03:05:44.805 --> 03:05:48.088
MATT: "We only talked in kind of vague platitudes

03:05:48.088 --> 03:05:50.395
"because I trust, but

03:05:54.138 --> 03:05:57.813
"what is it that all of you are doing next?

03:05:57.813 --> 03:05:59.379
"what is it that all of you are doing next?

03:06:00.708 --> 03:06:05.288
"What's the big thing that you can do and then stop?

03:06:05.288 --> 03:06:07.258
"You keep talking about stopping and coming home.

03:06:07.258 --> 03:06:08.241
"What's the line?"

03:06:10.608 --> 03:06:12.301
SAM: There's a force that's coming.

03:06:15.218 --> 03:06:19.208
Coming from some other place to...

03:06:21.738 --> 03:06:24.298
We don't know what it's going to do.

03:06:24.298 --> 03:06:27.641
It could affect the world.

03:06:30.058 --> 03:06:31.758
We've been trying to stop it, but,

03:06:34.878 --> 03:06:39.801
I mean, we've made a lot of enemies as we've gone.

03:06:43.613 --> 03:06:45.821
SAM: And some allies too, but

03:06:48.721 --> 03:06:50.437
there's just no balance.

03:06:52.395 --> 03:06:54.378
There's no way to

03:06:57.378 --> 03:07:00.069
protect the Empire, but also

03:07:01.053 --> 03:07:04.195
make sure that the Dynasty is okay.

03:07:04.195 --> 03:07:08.885
And there's no way to guard against this oncoming force

03:07:08.885 --> 03:07:11.010
while still--
MATT: (sighs)

03:07:11.010 --> 03:07:13.575
SAM: -- making sure that the people that we love are safe.

03:07:13.575 --> 03:07:14.935
There's no way to do it all.

03:07:14.935 --> 03:07:17.265
We can't; we can't do everything.

03:07:17.265 --> 03:07:19.185
MATT: "You can't, nobody can.

03:07:20.958 --> 03:07:24.719
"Don't put all that responsibility on your shoulders."

03:07:24.719 --> 03:07:27.576
SAM: Right, well, we didn't mean to.

03:07:29.605 --> 03:07:30.865
We started this whole thing

03:07:30.865 --> 03:07:34.723
just trying to find

03:07:34.723 --> 03:07:37.531
our place in the world, you know?

03:07:38.365 --> 03:07:40.328
Where we fit into it all.

03:07:42.245 --> 03:07:44.545
All of us were just trying to find a way home,

03:07:46.755 --> 03:07:50.865
and now we've been dragged into this

03:07:54.050 --> 03:07:57.385
story that's not ours, but it is.

03:07:57.385 --> 03:07:58.953
MATT: "But it is, though.

03:08:01.945 --> 03:08:05.858
"Terrible things have happened to many people, us included,

03:08:07.737 --> 03:08:09.845
"but you still found your way back to us.

03:08:11.155 --> 03:08:15.018
"You went across battlefields and saved me from

03:08:16.401 --> 03:08:19.985
"gods knows what sort of interrogations awaited me

03:08:19.985 --> 03:08:23.840
"and worse, if you hadn't spoken in my favor.

03:08:25.635 --> 03:08:26.635
"We found a new home.

03:08:31.435 --> 03:08:35.215
"I mean, look at you, I can't
express how proud of you I am."

03:08:35.215 --> 03:08:37.045
SAM: I just killed our son.

03:08:37.045 --> 03:08:38.668
MATT: "<i>You</i> did not.

03:08:41.735 --> 03:08:43.398
"That <i>thing</i> did,

03:08:44.316 --> 03:08:46.775
"and you stopped it from killing anybody else.

03:08:46.775 --> 03:08:49.878
"Then your friends saved his life.

"There are many circumstances that you just said

"that are beyond your control, and you feel like

"for all the bad things that happen throughout it?

"That's unfair to you. That's unfair to everybody.

03:09:08.852 --> 03:09:11.328
"Are you trying to do what you think is best?"

03:09:13.945 --> 03:09:15.435
SAM: Of course.

03:09:15.435 --> 03:09:17.678
MATT: "Then what else is there to do?

03:09:18.615 --> 03:09:20.705
"This force you're talking about,

03:09:20.705 --> 03:09:24.185
"is it a danger to me, to Luc, to us?"

03:09:24.185 --> 03:09:25.779
SAM: Yes.

03:09:25.779 --> 03:09:28.108
MATT: "Do you think you and your friends can stop it?"

03:09:30.705 --> 03:09:31.538
SAM: No.

03:09:32.855 --> 03:09:34.455
MATT: "Do you think anybody else can?"

03:09:35.945 --> 03:09:36.778
SAM: No.

03:09:39.128 --> 03:09:41.161
I think someone has to try.

03:09:43.145 --> 03:09:45.245
MATT: "Do you think they can do it without you?"

03:10:00.875 --> 03:10:01.965
SAM: I can't save--

03:10:05.745 --> 03:10:08.288
I can't be in both places at the same time.

03:10:09.235 --> 03:10:10.393
MATT: "I know.

03:10:16.022 --> 03:10:18.030
"But if stopping this is protecting us

03:10:18.030 --> 03:10:21.896
"But if stopping this is protecting us

"and you might all be the only chance all of us have,

"then there is no other choice."

03:10:40.165 --> 03:10:42.965
"You just have to make sure you come back when it's over.

03:10:45.055 --> 03:10:47.015
"Maybe then that'll be it."

03:10:50.575 --> 03:10:53.041
SAM: Maybe,

03:10:53.041 --> 03:10:55.157
or maybe I won't come home.

03:10:56.840 --> 03:10:59.248
Part of me just thinks that maybe

03:11:01.215 --> 03:11:05.248
I should keep you safe, as safe as I can.

03:11:06.755 --> 03:11:08.930
And even if it means

03:11:10.979 --> 03:11:13.621
they have a harder time of it, it's worth it.

03:11:17.105 --> 03:11:18.715
We don't have to discuss this now,

03:11:18.715 --> 03:11:20.178
we don't have to decide.

03:11:21.535 --> 03:11:22.768
Maybe it'll go away.

03:11:26.645 --> 03:11:29.215
All I know is we made it through this day

03:11:30.765 --> 03:11:34.557
and as long as we've been--

03:11:34.557 --> 03:11:36.823
as long as I've been with these people,

03:11:37.735 --> 03:11:39.665
it's been our number one goal

03:11:39.665 --> 03:11:41.515
is just make it through the day.

03:11:41.515 --> 03:11:44.398
And we did, one more time.

03:11:46.365 --> 03:11:50.208
So we'll wake up again tomorrow and

03:11:52.584 --> 03:11:57.513
see what new shit happens,

03:11:57.513 --> 03:11:59.225
see what new shit happens,

03:11:59.225 --> 03:12:04.088
deal with it, and try to go to sleep again tomorrow night.

03:12:07.553 --> 03:12:10.305
I'm so sorry to drag you into this.

03:12:10.305 --> 03:12:12.428
I'm so happy that you're alive.

03:12:15.748 --> 03:12:20.518
MATT: "Veth, I'm sorry I dragged you into this.

03:12:26.825 --> 03:12:29.405
"You can't carry the weight of being the protagonist

03:12:29.405 --> 03:12:34.405
"but then make the admission that so much of the story

03:12:34.435 --> 03:12:36.905
"is beyond your control.

03:12:36.905 --> 03:12:38.995
"You didn't get involved in a war

03:12:38.995 --> 03:12:40.895
"because you believed in one side or the other,

03:12:40.895 --> 03:12:43.348
"You got involved because <i>I</i> got involved.

03:12:45.415 --> 03:12:48.528
"Because <i>I</i> worked with the Assembly.

03:12:52.275 --> 03:12:55.275
"So if anyone's going to carry that weight, let us share it.

03:13:00.345 --> 03:13:01.178
"Okay?"

03:13:02.975 --> 03:13:04.195
SAM: Okay.

03:13:04.195 --> 03:13:05.495
MATT: "Whatever you want to do."

03:13:08.085 --> 03:13:09.285
SAM: We'll decide together.

03:13:10.315 --> 03:13:11.408
MATT: "We decide together.

03:13:13.795 --> 03:13:14.948
"Okay?"
SAM: Okay.

03:13:16.435 --> 03:13:17.745
MATT: "Love you."

03:13:17.745 --> 03:13:18.578
SAM: I love you.

03:13:24.445 --> 03:13:29.445
MATT: Curls up until eventually,

03:13:29.724 --> 03:13:31.165
him--

03:13:31.165 --> 03:13:32.875
Luc's been asleep, a little restless,

03:13:32.875 --> 03:13:34.848
but eventually finds himself to rest.

03:13:41.925 --> 03:13:43.755
You all find a night's sleep.

03:13:43.755 --> 03:13:46.305
LAURA: A little restless because I am pretty worried

03:13:46.305 --> 03:13:48.243
about the three that have not returned.

03:13:48.243 --> 03:13:49.326
MATT: Mm-hmm.

03:13:52.125 --> 03:13:54.535
SAM: Would you ask the ball?

03:13:54.535 --> 03:13:55.785
See if they can hear you.

03:13:58.753 --> 03:14:00.015
LAURA: I'm just going to, oh, I can't,

03:14:00.015 --> 03:14:01.995
it's got to be somewhere safe.

03:14:01.995 --> 03:14:04.115
The ball's got to be somewhere safe.
SAM: Just shake it.

03:14:04.115 --> 03:14:05.745
(laughter)

03:14:05.745 --> 03:14:07.945
TRAVIS: (clattering)

03:14:07.945 --> 03:14:09.118
MATT: It's been roughly,

03:14:11.195 --> 03:14:13.195
we'll say through the full night's rest,

03:14:14.055 --> 03:14:17.685
six to eight hours rest, it's been about nine hours

03:14:17.685 --> 03:14:19.775
and they haven't returned.

03:14:19.775 --> 03:14:21.137
LAURA: So we wake up and they're still not here?

03:14:21.137 --> 03:14:23.162
MATT: You wake up and they still haven't returned.

03:14:25.155 --> 03:14:27.865
LIAM: Caleb will just throw up another dome

03:14:28.775 --> 03:14:30.215
as soon as the first one was done.

03:14:30.215 --> 03:14:31.245
This is our home base.

03:14:31.245 --> 03:14:32.255
SAM: We're just waiting here?

03:14:32.255 --> 03:14:33.495
LIAM: Yes.
LAURA: We have to.

03:14:33.495 --> 03:14:34.875
LIAM: Yeah, we're not going out there,

03:14:34.875 --> 03:14:35.708
there's probably more--

03:14:35.708 --> 03:14:36.541
SAM: Not going out there,

03:14:36.541 --> 03:14:38.952
but can't you teleport us back?

03:14:38.952 --> 03:14:39.785
LIAM: Oh, we can go home. Yes, yes, yes.

03:14:39.785 --> 03:14:41.538
SAM: Yes, take the ball, go home.

03:14:42.465 --> 03:14:43.955
TRAVIS: It's really nice where you guys are. (laughs)

03:14:43.955 --> 03:14:45.524
TALIESIN: Where are we going to go?

03:14:45.524 --> 03:14:47.256
LAURA: We're going to go to Zadash.

03:14:47.256 --> 03:14:48.645
MARISHA: I always wanted to go to the Plane of Fire.

03:14:48.645 --> 03:14:49.731
LIAM: Guys, we're in the dome forever.

03:14:49.731 --> 03:14:51.488
LAURA: That's where my dad is.

03:14:51.488 --> 03:14:53.895
TALIESIN: It's what?
LAURA: It's where my dad is.

03:14:53.895 --> 03:14:54.899
That's where we've got to leave.

03:14:54.899 --> 03:14:57.357
SAM: Zadash, Zadash, Zadash.
TALIESIN: Zadash? Zadash.

03:14:57.357 --> 03:14:59.115
SAM: Do you want to steal any books before we go?

03:14:59.115 --> 03:15:02.151
TALIESIN: I honestly would say take them.

03:15:03.058 --> 03:15:05.878
LIAM: I'm good, I'm full up.

03:15:07.635 --> 03:15:08.468
Thank you.

03:15:10.195 --> 03:15:12.195
TALIESIN: How's your foot?

03:15:12.195 --> 03:15:16.538
LAURA: Oh, I've still got only eight toes.

03:15:18.745 --> 03:15:20.175
TALIESIN: How bad is it?

03:15:20.175 --> 03:15:22.173
SAM: Do tieflings have 10 normally?

03:15:23.335 --> 03:15:24.501
MATT: It's fairly healed.

03:15:24.501 --> 03:15:26.655
The magic helped tremendously,

03:15:26.655 --> 03:15:28.707
but there will be some lasting damage.

03:15:28.707 --> 03:15:32.155
Not enough to impact your balance too badly.

03:15:32.155 --> 03:15:34.836
LAURA: Yeah, it's fine. They're little nubbins.

03:15:34.836 --> 03:15:36.785
TALIESIN: We'll take care of that a little later.

03:15:36.785 --> 03:15:40.105
LIAM: Yeah, if we are all alive in a few weeks

03:15:40.105 --> 03:15:42.415
and have some time to breathe,

03:15:42.415 --> 03:15:44.085
you and I will go and get some clay

03:15:44.085 --> 03:15:45.445
and we'll fix your toes right up.

03:15:45.445 --> 03:15:47.255
LAURA: You'll make me some new magic toes!

03:15:47.255 --> 03:15:48.865
LIAM: Yes, magic toes.

03:15:48.865 --> 03:15:51.395
TALIESIN: I can do that if we get a good night's sleep.

03:15:51.395 --> 03:15:52.475
If nothing happens tomorrow,

03:15:52.475 --> 03:15:54.555
I can also just make that happen.

03:15:54.555 --> 03:15:58.365
SAM: Wait, no, she can paint herself toes.

03:15:58.365 --> 03:16:00.965
LAURA: I can't paint living things,

03:16:00.965 --> 03:16:02.645
so they'd be dead toes on me.

03:16:02.645 --> 03:16:04.661
SAM: That would be kind of cool.

03:16:04.661 --> 03:16:05.979
TALIESIN: (uncertain noise)
LAURA: It could be neat.

03:16:05.979 --> 03:16:06.929
TALIESIN: I don't know.

03:16:06.929 --> 03:16:09.328
SAM: Porcelain toes.
LAURA: I can make them fun shapes.

03:16:10.175 --> 03:16:11.992
SAM: You can have one really long toe.

03:16:11.992 --> 03:16:14.242
(laughter)

03:16:15.214 --> 03:16:16.931
That looks like a dick.
LAURA: Yeah!

03:16:18.135 --> 03:16:20.735
I don't know if I want a dick on my foot.

03:16:20.735 --> 03:16:22.235
LIAM: You could be a Bond villain.

03:16:23.192 --> 03:16:24.525
MATT: So what's the plan?

03:16:24.525 --> 03:16:25.405
SAM: Pack a toe.

03:16:25.405 --> 03:16:27.506
LAURA: We're going to--
LIAM: Get the hell out of here.

03:16:27.506 --> 03:16:28.756
LAURA: Go to Zadash?

03:16:29.925 --> 03:16:31.765
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: I'm going to

03:16:33.895 --> 03:16:35.995
grab the Happy Fun Ball and hold on to it.

03:16:37.245 --> 03:16:40.445
Gee whiz, what if they pop out while we're teleporting?

03:16:40.445 --> 03:16:41.945
What do you think will happen?

03:16:43.355 --> 03:16:44.605
The odds are pretty slim.

03:16:46.323 --> 03:16:47.936
Be an interesting twist.

03:16:47.936 --> 03:16:49.068
LAURA: Okay.

03:16:49.068 --> 03:16:50.636
MATT: Ever seen "The Fly"?

03:16:50.636 --> 03:16:53.961
(laughter)

03:16:53.961 --> 03:16:55.344
ASHLEY: Yes.

03:16:56.968 --> 03:17:01.218
LAURA: I guess-- well, that's a weird time travel thing.

03:17:02.205 --> 03:17:04.027
How would that work?

03:17:04.027 --> 03:17:06.221
SAM: Only one way to find out.

03:17:06.221 --> 03:17:08.765
LAURA: I could try sending them a message.

03:17:08.765 --> 03:17:11.865
Technically it works across planes.

03:17:11.865 --> 03:17:14.085
But we've already been with them

03:17:14.085 --> 03:17:15.615
and they didn't get a message.

03:17:15.615 --> 03:17:16.824
How does that work, Matthew?

03:17:16.824 --> 03:17:18.177
TRAVIS: So if you'd sent the message and it was like,

03:17:18.177 --> 03:17:19.231
(fast gibberish)

03:17:19.231 --> 03:17:21.794
(laughter)

03:17:21.794 --> 03:17:23.835
LIAM: All you would hear is (squeaks).

03:17:23.835 --> 03:17:26.277
TALIESIN: Might be like when your cell phone comes back into

03:17:26.277 --> 03:17:29.877
service and it's just (pinging).

03:17:30.890 --> 03:17:31.940
LAURA: Yeah, that's weird.

03:17:36.165 --> 03:17:37.975
I would try.

03:17:37.975 --> 03:17:40.235
I don't have the knowledge that we already saw them.

03:17:40.235 --> 03:17:43.345
I would try to message Fjord.

03:17:43.345 --> 03:17:44.628
MATT: Okay, go for it.

03:17:45.628 --> 03:17:48.568
LAURA: Fjord, are you guys okay?

03:17:49.795 --> 03:17:51.305
Did you make it through that first room

03:17:51.305 --> 03:17:54.675
and the second room? Are you in the dragon room?

03:17:54.675 --> 03:17:56.541
What's taking so long? We're here.

03:17:56.541 --> 03:17:58.585
We almost--
SAM: 25 words.

03:17:58.585 --> 03:18:01.715
MATT: As you are standing there with Yasha and Beauregard

03:18:01.715 --> 03:18:03.525
with the golem looming behind you

03:18:03.525 --> 03:18:04.775
about to break out of its stun,

03:18:04.775 --> 03:18:06.265
and your hands, you're all agreeing to go ahead

03:18:06.265 --> 03:18:08.555
and place your hand down onto the glowing crystal.

03:18:08.555 --> 03:18:12.031
You hear this at super speed in your head.

03:18:12.031 --> 03:18:14.430
(fast gibberish)

03:18:14.430 --> 03:18:17.451
TRAVIS: Uh-- (clears throat)

03:18:17.451 --> 03:18:19.085
ASHLEY: Are you okay? Do you need a tissue?

03:18:19.085 --> 03:18:20.178
TRAVIS: We got to go!

03:18:21.085 --> 03:18:21.918
MATT: You hear

03:18:21.918 --> 03:18:26.818
(slowed-down) "We got

03:18:26.818 --> 03:18:31.560
"to

03:18:31.560 --> 03:18:34.276
"go!"

03:18:34.276 --> 03:18:36.526
(laughter)

03:18:37.484 --> 03:18:41.259
TRAVIS: (drawn-out, inaudible words)

03:18:41.259 --> 03:18:45.675
TRAVIS: (drawn-out, inaudible words)

03:18:45.675 --> 03:18:47.371
MATT: Passion of the scout.

03:18:47.371 --> 03:18:48.204
TALIESIN: All these poor people

03:18:48.204 --> 03:18:50.532
have no idea what's going on right now.

03:18:50.532 --> 03:18:53.792
MATT: I know, beautiful.
MARISHA: That's a deep inside joke.

03:18:53.792 --> 03:18:56.274
TRAVIS: (drawn-out, inaudible words)
MATT: All right.

03:18:56.274 --> 03:18:59.992
So you do hear that back and forth.

03:18:59.992 --> 03:19:01.127
LAURA: What happened?

03:19:01.127 --> 03:19:03.460
MATT: You heard that.
LAURA: That's what I heard?

03:19:04.738 --> 03:19:07.393
They are being tortured.

03:19:07.393 --> 03:19:09.589
(laughter)

03:19:09.589 --> 03:19:10.422
SAM: Oh no!

03:19:10.422 --> 03:19:12.355
LIAM: They're dying, R2!

03:19:12.355 --> 03:19:14.518
(laughter)

03:19:14.518 --> 03:19:16.818
SAM: Oh no!

03:19:16.818 --> 03:19:18.695
LAURA: I don't know what to do.

03:19:18.695 --> 03:19:20.187
SAM: Should we go in after them?

03:19:20.187 --> 03:19:22.312
LAURA: I don't know.

03:19:22.312 --> 03:19:23.210
SAM: Caleb?

03:19:23.210 --> 03:19:26.625
LIAM: Well, I-- (sighs)

03:19:26.625 --> 03:19:28.455
I think we should get out of here.

03:19:28.455 --> 03:19:30.938
SAM: Yes, yes, yes, yes, let's get out of here first.

03:19:32.685 --> 03:19:35.645
LAURA: I'm so afraid because I know where they actually are.

03:19:35.645 --> 03:19:38.028
What if they bamf out while we're teleporting?

03:19:38.028 --> 03:19:38.961
I'm so scared.

03:19:38.961 --> 03:19:41.675
LIAM: We'll be quicker and leaner without them.

03:19:41.675 --> 03:19:43.787
A brand new fighting force.

03:19:43.787 --> 03:19:45.161
LAURA: Oh no!

03:19:46.035 --> 03:19:49.014
MARISHA: Like throwing a Slurpee out a car window, just--

03:19:49.014 --> 03:19:52.431
TRAVIS: Oh my god! Holy shit!

03:19:52.431 --> 03:19:56.623
(laughter)

03:19:58.024 --> 03:20:00.124
TRAVIS: (screaming)

03:20:01.052 --> 03:20:03.355
LIAM: Eight billion tiny beads of liquid.

03:20:03.355 --> 03:20:06.009
TRAVIS: How did you get to that imagery so fast?

03:20:06.009 --> 03:20:07.085
MARISHA: I don't know.
TRAVIS: What the fuck

03:20:07.085 --> 03:20:08.945
is wrong with you?

03:20:08.945 --> 03:20:09.778
Oh my god!

03:20:09.778 --> 03:20:11.258
SAM: It's definitely something she's done.

03:20:11.258 --> 03:20:14.322
(laughter)

03:20:14.322 --> 03:20:15.628
TRAVIS: Oh man.

03:20:17.875 --> 03:20:19.488
Wow.
MATT: So what's going on?

03:20:24.192 --> 03:20:25.657
LAURA: Are we going? Are we staying?

03:20:25.657 --> 03:20:26.751
SAM: We have to get out of here.

03:20:26.751 --> 03:20:28.815
Let's get out of here.

03:20:28.815 --> 03:20:29.786
LIAM: Yeah, we should go.

03:20:29.786 --> 03:20:32.036
SAM: It'll only take a moment.

03:20:34.685 --> 03:20:36.635
LIAM: Is the scroll that we have,

03:20:36.635 --> 03:20:38.342
was a one-time thing to get here?
MATT: Yes.

03:20:38.342 --> 03:20:41.125
LIAM: You're Plane Shifting us.

03:20:41.125 --> 03:20:41.958
LAURA: I am?!

03:20:43.025 --> 03:20:44.996
LIAM: Yeah, you are.
LAURA: You can't just teleport us?

03:20:44.996 --> 03:20:46.255
TRAVIS: (laughs)

03:20:46.255 --> 03:20:49.363
LIAM: Teleport does not go across the planes.

03:20:49.363 --> 03:20:50.880
SAM: You know how?
LIAM: That's what Dimension--

03:20:50.880 --> 03:20:52.385
LAURA: I mean, yeah, I got to prepare it.

03:20:52.385 --> 03:20:54.945
It's still morning, I would have known that.

03:20:54.945 --> 03:20:56.394
LIAM: We're all groggy.

03:20:56.394 --> 03:20:58.555
MATT: This would have been probably a conversation

03:20:58.555 --> 03:21:00.787
before you left, I'll allow it.

03:21:00.787 --> 03:21:02.895
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

03:21:03.939 --> 03:21:05.905
MATT: You did have a rod attuned to Exandria.

03:21:05.905 --> 03:21:07.285
LAURA: Yes.
LIAM: Yes.

03:21:08.285 --> 03:21:09.975
MATT: Choose a location of preference.

03:21:09.975 --> 03:21:12.090
TALIESIN: Does it burn the rod, or does it not burn the rod?

03:21:12.090 --> 03:21:13.243
MATT: It does not burn the rod.

03:21:14.835 --> 03:21:17.768
LAURA: I choose

03:21:19.301 --> 03:21:21.245
my dad's room.

03:21:21.245 --> 03:21:22.645
SAM: Oh.

03:21:22.645 --> 03:21:24.348
MATT: Okay.
SAM: Like his bedroom?

03:21:24.348 --> 03:21:25.950
LAURA: Yeah, why not?
LIAM: I love that you and I were

03:21:25.950 --> 03:21:27.652
both waiting for the other one to do it.

03:21:27.652 --> 03:21:28.982
And we're like, "You going to go?

03:21:28.982 --> 03:21:30.858
"You going to go, you going to go, you going to go?"

03:21:30.858 --> 03:21:33.125
LAURA: I thought like, why are we taking so long?

03:21:33.125 --> 03:21:36.233
MATT: Weirdest game of magic chicken I've ever seen.

03:21:38.515 --> 03:21:39.631
Okay.

03:21:39.631 --> 03:21:41.198
LAURA: My bad. (laughs)

03:21:42.512 --> 03:21:43.862
MATT: Let me just double check.

03:21:52.915 --> 03:21:56.415
Okay, it can't be quite that specific.

03:21:56.415 --> 03:21:59.815
LAURA: Oh, (laughs) okay.

03:21:59.815 --> 03:22:01.205
MATT: You can say, like, Zadash

03:22:01.205 --> 03:22:04.602
or if you said the Evening Nip, maybe?

03:22:04.602 --> 03:22:06.215
LAURA: The Evening Nip, maybe.

03:22:06.215 --> 03:22:08.775
MATT: Okay, there you go.

03:22:08.775 --> 03:22:10.635
So as you gather up your troop

03:22:10.635 --> 03:22:14.675
and begin your incantation,

03:22:14.675 --> 03:22:18.205
clutching the rod that is attuned to Exandria.

03:22:18.205 --> 03:22:21.485
LAURA: Let me just-- can we just double check?

03:22:21.485 --> 03:22:22.725
SAM: That you have the rod?

03:22:22.725 --> 03:22:24.040
LAURA: No, no, no, no, we have that.

03:22:24.040 --> 03:22:26.715
SAM: Okay.
LAURA: That's fine, but--

03:22:31.215 --> 03:22:33.835
You and eight willing creatures.

03:22:33.835 --> 03:22:36.705
MARISHA: Right, so realistically you need to go.

03:22:36.705 --> 03:22:37.538
SAM: Oh yeah, no, we're good.

03:22:37.538 --> 03:22:39.121
LAURA: No, no, yeah, we're fine.

03:22:39.121 --> 03:22:41.133
MATT: As long as nobody comes out of the ball.

03:22:41.133 --> 03:22:43.107
LAURA: Yeah, that's right, we've got to go now.

03:22:43.107 --> 03:22:46.102
(overlapping voices)
MATT: They are--

03:22:46.102 --> 03:22:47.947
LAURA: -- about to go. We've got to go now.

03:22:47.947 --> 03:22:49.145
LIAM: You broke the door.

03:22:49.145 --> 03:22:50.143
SAM: Let's go, let's go, let's go!

03:22:50.143 --> 03:22:50.976
TRAVIS: Go!

03:22:52.164 --> 03:22:53.581
LAURA: Okay, let's go.

03:22:56.655 --> 03:22:58.675
MATT: Okay, so, you doing it?

03:22:58.675 --> 03:22:59.508
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: All right.

03:22:59.508 --> 03:23:01.125
MARISHA: Why'd he roll?

03:23:01.125 --> 03:23:02.859
TALIESIN: Because we took too long.
TRAVIS: We're going to get left there.

03:23:02.859 --> 03:23:03.907
MARISHA: Holy shit.

03:23:03.907 --> 03:23:05.755
MATT: (laughs)

03:23:05.755 --> 03:23:09.125
MATT: As you focus on your friends, concentrate on the rod,

03:23:09.125 --> 03:23:10.915
concentrate on Exandria, concentrate on the Evening Nip.

03:23:10.915 --> 03:23:14.325
Think of your father, think of the Zadash, the streets.

03:23:14.325 --> 03:23:17.625
There is this sudden gathering of green cloth

03:23:17.625 --> 03:23:20.258
There is this sudden gathering of green cloth

03:23:20.258 --> 03:23:23.405
that encircles you like a curtain.

03:23:23.405 --> 03:23:26.175
And as it spins around and then unfurls,

03:23:26.175 --> 03:23:27.957
you here (as Artagan) "Ta da!"

03:23:27.957 --> 03:23:29.702
(laughter)

03:23:29.702 --> 03:23:32.285
MATT: And you are standing in an alleyway

03:23:33.345 --> 03:23:37.338
on the streets of Zadash in the middle of a rainy morning.

03:23:38.845 --> 03:23:42.465
Glancing about, you take a moment

03:23:42.465 --> 03:23:45.349
and then you understand you're a few
blocks away from the Evening Nip.

03:23:45.349 --> 03:23:47.485
Not too-- (metal clanging) a flash of light,

03:23:47.485 --> 03:23:49.012
a heavy metal sound and then

03:23:50.301 --> 03:23:52.925
Yasha, Beauregard, and Fjord all arrive.

03:23:52.925 --> 03:23:54.035
TALIESIN: Well, that could have gone poorly.

03:23:54.035 --> 03:23:56.415
ASHLEY: Oh my god, you guys.

03:23:56.415 --> 03:23:58.705
TRAVIS: Shut the ball, shut the
ball, shut it! Can you shut it?

03:23:58.705 --> 03:24:00.018
SAM: You can turn it off? How do you, what?

03:24:00.018 --> 03:24:01.334
TRAVIS: (frantic babbling)

03:24:01.334 --> 03:24:02.694
Is it shut?
LAURA: Can you shut it?

03:24:02.694 --> 03:24:04.065
MARISHA: We don't want it to come after us!

03:24:04.065 --> 03:24:06.096
SAM: It? What?

03:24:06.096 --> 03:24:07.553
MARISHA: Clay meanie.

03:24:09.105 --> 03:24:11.365
TRAVIS: There was a golem, we touched a book in the library

03:24:11.365 --> 03:24:14.650
and of course a fucking golem came out after it, Beau!

03:24:14.650 --> 03:24:15.735
MARISHA: (indignant sputtering)

03:24:15.735 --> 03:24:17.195
We tried, we tried--

03:24:17.195 --> 03:24:18.915
TALIESIN: Do you have the haversack or something?

03:24:18.915 --> 03:24:20.195
MARISHA: We all agreed to look at the books!

03:24:20.195 --> 03:24:22.157
ASHLEY: We did, we all looked at the books for Caleb.

03:24:22.157 --> 03:24:24.080
MATT: You do know the stun has faded at this point?

03:24:24.080 --> 03:24:24.930
MARISHA: Huh?
MATT: You do know that the stun

03:24:24.930 --> 03:24:27.947
has faded at this point?
MARISHA: Yeah, stun will have faded. Yeah.

03:24:27.947 --> 03:24:29.905
LAURA: Can we close the ball?
SAM: Can it follow you?

03:24:29.905 --> 03:24:34.855
MARISHA: It followed us through
the stained glass window, so.

03:24:34.855 --> 03:24:38.116
LIAM: Can Happy Fun fit in the haversack or is it too big?

03:24:38.116 --> 03:24:40.173
MATT: It's a bit big for that, unfortunately.
SAM: Wait, if it comes out in the haversack

03:24:40.173 --> 03:24:41.845
it will explode the haversack!

03:24:41.845 --> 03:24:43.759
LAURA: Close the ball.

03:24:43.759 --> 03:24:44.892
LIAM: (high-pitched beeping sound)

03:24:44.892 --> 03:24:46.742
MATT: Okay, make an intelligence check for me.

03:24:46.742 --> 03:24:49.225
ASHLEY: (laughs)
TRAVIS: (alarm noises)

03:24:49.225 --> 03:24:50.318
LIAM: Viper armed.

03:24:50.318 --> 03:24:52.435
LAURA: Guidance.
(laughter)

03:24:52.435 --> 03:24:54.035
LIAM: You said it before it went down.

03:24:57.095 --> 03:24:59.245
Intelligence check?
MATT: Yes.

03:24:59.245 --> 03:25:00.115
LIAM: 15.

03:25:00.115 --> 03:25:01.735
MATT: 15, okay.

03:25:01.735 --> 03:25:05.365
You just offset one of the slight elements

03:25:05.365 --> 03:25:06.805
of the outside disc and as it does,

03:25:06.805 --> 03:25:10.815
you watch as two outer shell portion's rims

03:25:10.815 --> 03:25:12.055
(whirring).

03:25:12.055 --> 03:25:15.815
You watch as the surface of it suddenly jumbles itself

03:25:15.815 --> 03:25:19.992
like a multi-faceted Rubik's cube, it like (whirring)

03:25:19.992 --> 03:25:21.555
rearranges itself into this odd shape

03:25:21.555 --> 03:25:24.255
before fitting back into a sphere.

03:25:24.255 --> 03:25:28.605
Not looking like any of the previous arrangements

03:25:28.605 --> 03:25:30.155
that you saw on it previously.

03:25:30.155 --> 03:25:33.308
TRAVIS: Good. Oh, the rod took
you to Rexxentrum, that's nice.

03:25:34.165 --> 03:25:36.608
ASHLEY: Boy, we have had a time.

03:25:37.985 --> 03:25:39.485
My goodness.

03:25:39.485 --> 03:25:42.685
SAM: Are you okay?
LIAM: Went pretty smoothly for us.

03:25:42.685 --> 03:25:43.575
MARISHA: Really?

03:25:43.575 --> 03:25:44.408
TALIESIN: No.
LIAM: No.

03:25:44.408 --> 03:25:46.555
TRAVIS: Forgot we didn't have anybody that could pick locks.

03:25:46.555 --> 03:25:47.722
That was the hardest part.

03:25:47.722 --> 03:25:48.785
TALIESIN: Aw, I knew--

03:25:48.785 --> 03:25:50.755
LAURA: That's what took you so long.

03:25:50.755 --> 03:25:53.022
MARISHA: Yasha ended up beating down a door.

03:25:53.022 --> 03:25:54.045
TRAVIS: Beast mode.
TALIESIN: You can do that?

03:25:54.045 --> 03:25:55.135
MARISHA: But then that meant

03:25:55.135 --> 03:25:59.218
that we ejected the pod and then one hallway

03:25:59.218 --> 03:26:00.457
tore off.
MATT: By the way,

03:26:00.457 --> 03:26:01.965
you can cross out that connection on the map,

03:26:01.965 --> 03:26:03.425
by the way, between those two chambers.

03:26:03.425 --> 03:26:05.625
SAM: Oh no.
LAURA: It's gone-skies.

03:26:05.625 --> 03:26:09.172
TRAVIS: Which one? The one with the tapestry and the study?

03:26:09.172 --> 03:26:11.213
MATT: Yep.
LIAM: -- entry room to, yeah.

03:26:11.213 --> 03:26:13.475
LAURA: So if you bamf into that entry room now

03:26:13.475 --> 03:26:14.825
you could be stuck there forever.

03:26:14.825 --> 03:26:15.695
because you won't be able to get out.

03:26:15.695 --> 03:26:18.167
MATT: There's possibly, based on the map, another way.

03:26:18.167 --> 03:26:19.661
LAURA: Oh right, other doors.
ASHLEY: My bad.

03:26:19.661 --> 03:26:21.965
MATT: It's just many other steps.

03:26:21.965 --> 03:26:23.715
TRAVIS: That was all we had left.

03:26:23.715 --> 03:26:27.025
MATT: I mean, got you where you needed to go.

03:26:27.025 --> 03:26:28.416
TALIESIN: It worked.

03:26:29.427 --> 03:26:30.855
MATT: It's at this point, Caduceus, you notice

03:26:30.855 --> 03:26:33.515
at the end of the hallway, on the edge of the road

03:26:33.515 --> 03:26:35.215
where it enters the main street.

03:26:35.215 --> 03:26:37.985
You see like an 11-year-old kid

03:26:37.985 --> 03:26:41.845
wearing this little hood,

03:26:41.845 --> 03:26:42.695
scarf element there,

03:26:42.695 --> 03:26:45.375
who's just standing there holding a basket, going--

03:26:48.355 --> 03:26:49.580
TALIESIN: I turn human.

03:26:51.037 --> 03:26:52.795
MATT: "(gasps)" And he just runs.

03:26:52.795 --> 03:26:54.345
SAM: No witnesses!

03:26:54.345 --> 03:26:56.595
(laughter)

03:26:57.455 --> 03:26:58.755
LIAM: (fire roaring)

03:27:00.176 --> 03:27:02.738
LIAM: I'll take my coat off and cover up the Happy Fun Ball.

03:27:03.815 --> 03:27:05.385
I need a private place

03:27:05.385 --> 03:27:08.165
so I can put this into the Vault of Amber.

03:27:08.165 --> 03:27:10.575
LAURA: How big is it? Would it fit in the haversack?

03:27:10.575 --> 03:27:11.930
MATT: It's about that large.
LAURA: So no.

03:27:11.930 --> 03:27:13.348
MATT: It's like a large basketball.

03:27:14.945 --> 03:27:17.051
MARISHA: Looks like we're-- Zadash?

03:27:17.051 --> 03:27:19.096
LAURA: Let's get down to my father's--

03:27:19.096 --> 03:27:21.315
TALIESIN: Let's just get inside and take care of it.

03:27:21.315 --> 03:27:22.915
LAURA: We're really close to the Nip.

03:27:24.995 --> 03:27:26.605
LIAM: All right.
MARISHA: Yeah, probably a good call

03:27:26.605 --> 03:27:29.078
to not send the families in there, by the way.

03:27:30.425 --> 03:27:31.900
SAM: Could have been bad for them?

03:27:31.900 --> 03:27:34.065
ASHLEY: Oof!
TRAVIS: Yeah, boy.

03:27:34.065 --> 03:27:37.805
ASHLEY: I mean, we just could have gotten lost.

03:27:37.805 --> 03:27:40.267
MARISHA: We sort of triggered this clay golem.

03:27:40.267 --> 03:27:41.100
TRAVIS: Somebody could have gotten hurt.

03:27:41.100 --> 03:27:43.928
MARISHA: It wasn't too bad. We were able to actually--

03:27:43.928 --> 03:27:45.478
MATT: (as Luc) "I died."

03:27:45.478 --> 03:27:46.314
ASHLEY: Hmm?

03:27:46.314 --> 03:27:48.682
MATT: And Yeza goes like, "Shh."

03:27:48.682 --> 03:27:50.035
TALIESIN: That happened.

03:27:50.035 --> 03:27:51.928
SAM: Sort of a family tradition now.

03:27:54.165 --> 03:27:56.325
TRAVIS: Is that an expression in your family?

03:27:56.325 --> 03:27:57.355
SAM: No.

03:27:57.355 --> 03:27:58.745
LAURA: He died.

03:27:58.745 --> 03:28:03.695
SAM: But Caduceus saved him.

03:28:03.695 --> 03:28:05.775
TALIESIN: I still have pain, right-- It was a lot.

03:28:05.775 --> 03:28:07.979
But it was good.

03:28:07.979 --> 03:28:09.495
LAURA: I'll just go up and start massaging

03:28:09.495 --> 03:28:10.862
the back of Caduceus' neck.
TALIESIN: Oh man,

03:28:10.862 --> 03:28:12.635
I'm going to kneel down for that, okay.

03:28:12.635 --> 03:28:15.395
MARISHA: Where did the tuning fork take you?

03:28:15.395 --> 03:28:18.575
SAM: To this very fiery place and it was horrible

03:28:18.575 --> 03:28:20.585
and we barely escaped with our lives.

03:28:20.585 --> 03:28:22.075
But we're all together again.

03:28:22.075 --> 03:28:24.550
So it's good.

03:28:25.745 --> 03:28:28.745
TRAVIS: Oh.
TALIESIN: We took the notebooks, right?

03:28:28.745 --> 03:28:29.755
SAM: No?

03:28:29.755 --> 03:28:30.815
LAURA: No, we did.

03:28:30.815 --> 03:28:32.485
SAM: One, all, some?

03:28:32.485 --> 03:28:33.318
LAURA: Oh wait, no, we didn't.

03:28:33.318 --> 03:28:34.151
SAM: No, I don't think we did.

03:28:34.151 --> 03:28:36.235
TALIESIN: I thought we had a discussion
about taking the notebooks.

03:28:36.235 --> 03:28:38.953
LAURA: And he said he left it.
MARISHA: He said he didn't want them.

03:28:38.953 --> 03:28:39.786
MATT: Yeah.

03:28:39.786 --> 03:28:41.125
TALIESIN: Ah, all right.

03:28:41.125 --> 03:28:42.320
LAURA: Well, we took the one.

03:28:42.320 --> 03:28:44.074
TALIESIN: All right.

03:28:44.074 --> 03:28:46.235
SAM: Did you take the one?
LAURA: Yeah.

03:28:46.235 --> 03:28:47.705
TALIESIN: Everyone knows, if you see books in a room,

03:28:47.705 --> 03:28:48.705
you always take them.

03:28:48.705 --> 03:28:49.848
ASHLEY: Well, that's what--

03:28:49.848 --> 03:28:51.960
TRAVIS: (hesitated babbling)

03:28:51.960 --> 03:28:53.605
SAM: To the Nip!
TRAVIS: To the Nip!

03:28:53.605 --> 03:28:55.215
LIAM: It's like the old saying,

03:28:55.215 --> 03:28:57.915
I killed my whole family, I threw them under a bridge.

03:28:59.405 --> 03:29:00.622
TRAVIS: Is that the saying?

03:29:01.765 --> 03:29:03.785
MARISHA: That's classic.

03:29:03.785 --> 03:29:05.167
Ooh, it's been a while since I heard that.

03:29:05.167 --> 03:29:06.845
TRAVIS: To the Leaky Nip!

03:29:06.845 --> 03:29:09.035
MATT: As you guys go walking, Luc comes over

03:29:09.035 --> 03:29:12.295
and grabs Caduceus' pinky

03:29:13.225 --> 03:29:14.245
and just walks along side,

03:29:14.245 --> 03:29:15.460
holding your pinky, and looks up at you,

03:29:15.460 --> 03:29:17.468
just goes like, "You're really cool."

03:29:18.355 --> 03:29:19.569
TALIESIN: You smell like farts.

03:29:19.569 --> 03:29:21.819
(laughter)

03:29:22.975 --> 03:29:24.992
MATT: You swear, you hear a little (high-pitched fart).

03:29:26.375 --> 03:29:28.185
MARISHA: A little halfling toot.

03:29:28.185 --> 03:29:29.456
LIAM: Yeah.

03:29:29.456 --> 03:29:30.956
MARISHA: It's higher pitched.
LIAM: Hummingbird.

03:29:32.025 --> 03:29:34.905
ASHLEY: It's like a little bit
of air coming out of a balloon.

03:29:34.905 --> 03:29:36.755
MATT: You walk for a little bit before you stop

03:29:36.755 --> 03:29:38.885
and look back and you see back in the alleyway.

03:29:38.885 --> 03:29:41.820
Marion's (heavy breathing).

03:29:41.820 --> 03:29:45.830
LAURA: Mama. Oh my gosh, oh my gosh.

03:29:45.830 --> 03:29:47.516
SAM: Oh yes, oh.

03:29:47.516 --> 03:29:51.382
MATT: "(hesitant stammering)"

03:29:51.382 --> 03:29:53.390
ASHLEY: We're the worst.
LAURA: Oh, here.

03:29:54.895 --> 03:29:55.905
Fjord.
TRAVIS: Yes?

03:29:55.905 --> 03:29:56.738
LAURA: Help Mama.

03:29:56.738 --> 03:29:58.113
TRAVIS: Yeah, of course, Marion,

03:29:58.113 --> 03:29:59.595
please come take my hand.

03:29:59.595 --> 03:30:02.398
LAURA: I'm going to go off by myself for just a moment.

03:30:04.545 --> 03:30:06.078
TRAVIS: Come with me. It'll be fine.

03:30:07.285 --> 03:30:09.080
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

03:30:09.080 --> 03:30:10.539
MARISHA: Come on, Fjord.

03:30:11.947 --> 03:30:13.515
TRAVIS: Ooh, 18 plus--

03:30:13.515 --> 03:30:14.535
SAM: Natural one.

03:30:14.535 --> 03:30:16.858
TRAVIS: -- a lot. Scroll up, you bastard.

03:30:18.345 --> 03:30:19.178
23.

03:30:20.205 --> 03:30:21.162
MATT: She looks at you.

03:30:24.387 --> 03:30:28.429
"(breathless) Well, if you insist."

03:30:28.429 --> 03:30:30.382
LAURA: Don't flirt with him, Mama.

03:30:30.382 --> 03:30:31.495
TRAVIS: Jester, what?

03:30:31.495 --> 03:30:32.861
LAURA: Nothing.

03:30:32.861 --> 03:30:35.915
(laughter)

03:30:35.915 --> 03:30:37.856
MATT: She takes a deep breath--
SAM: ♪ Jester's mom-- ♪

03:30:37.856 --> 03:30:39.831
MATT: -- and closes her eyes,
SAM: ♪ -- has got it going on. ♪

03:30:39.831 --> 03:30:44.195
squeezes your hand and begins to slowly walk along with you

03:30:44.195 --> 03:30:46.135
and trying to control her breath

03:30:46.135 --> 03:30:49.602
and slowly you guide her outside of the alleyway

03:30:49.602 --> 03:30:52.351
and slowly you guide her outside of the alleyway

03:30:52.351 --> 03:30:55.282
into the open cobblestone streets of Zadash.

03:30:56.482 --> 03:30:58.225
And she's holding her eyes closed tight

03:30:58.225 --> 03:31:00.678
and just letting you guide her.

03:31:03.255 --> 03:31:05.055
LAURA: I'm going to fall back behind them

03:31:06.065 --> 03:31:09.262
and watch and make sure she's doing okay,

03:31:09.262 --> 03:31:13.461
but I'm going to send a message to my dad.

03:31:13.461 --> 03:31:14.845
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: Who I never

03:31:14.845 --> 03:31:17.525
checked with to make sure any of this was okay.

03:31:17.525 --> 03:31:18.358
TRAVIS: When do you ever?

03:31:18.358 --> 03:31:19.248
LAURA: Yeah, well.

03:31:20.445 --> 03:31:23.325
LIAM: We're coming over. Could be there soon.

03:31:23.325 --> 03:31:28.038
LAURA: Hey, dad. Crazy stuff happened.

03:31:29.475 --> 03:31:32.719
So Mama and Veth's family

03:31:32.719 --> 03:31:35.005
are going to come stay with you for a while.

03:31:35.005 --> 03:31:38.755
Super important they need to be kept safe.

03:31:39.988 --> 03:31:40.821
Help.

03:31:44.715 --> 03:31:46.298
MATT: There's a pause

03:31:50.165 --> 03:31:51.939
and eventually you're worried

03:31:51.939 --> 03:31:53.605
maybe he didn't hear it.

03:31:57.585 --> 03:31:59.178
Then you get a response.

03:32:01.473 --> 03:32:02.314
"Oh.

03:32:04.856 --> 03:32:05.981
"Boy.

03:32:09.821 --> 03:32:14.805
"Well-- (sighs)"

03:32:15.875 --> 03:32:16.768
And that's it.

03:32:16.768 --> 03:32:18.851
(laughter)

03:32:20.575 --> 03:32:23.995
MATT: As you all make your way to the entrance

03:32:23.995 --> 03:32:28.075
to the Evening Nip, you enter the familiar shaded interior.

03:32:28.075 --> 03:32:29.625
As you lead Marion to the door,

03:32:29.625 --> 03:32:31.075
she puts her hand up and touches it

03:32:31.075 --> 03:32:34.357
and "(breathes deeply)."

03:32:34.357 --> 03:32:36.575
At which point she turns around and opens her eyes finally

03:32:36.575 --> 03:32:39.375
to look at the surrounding buildings

03:32:39.375 --> 03:32:42.045
and the walls and the people in the streets

03:32:42.045 --> 03:32:45.245
and she just goes, "Wow.

03:32:50.190 --> 03:32:51.315
"I've never been here.

03:32:54.315 --> 03:32:55.395
"Thank you."

03:32:55.395 --> 03:32:57.845
TRAVIS: Your daughter's been to some incredible places.

03:33:00.809 --> 03:33:01.950
MATT: "(sighs)

03:33:05.375 --> 03:33:06.208
"(sigh of relief)

03:33:07.066 --> 03:33:08.137
"(sigh of wonder)"

03:33:08.137 --> 03:33:09.715
LAURA: I'll come up on the other side and hold her hand

03:33:09.715 --> 03:33:10.988
as we go in.

03:33:13.165 --> 03:33:15.791
It's going to be quite an adventure.

03:33:18.392 --> 03:33:20.705
MATT: And you see her nerves have shifted.

03:33:20.705 --> 03:33:25.605
At once time, it was a oncoming panic attack

03:33:25.605 --> 03:33:30.605
has now transitioned into a nervous butterflies

03:33:30.755 --> 03:33:35.755
meets jumble of emotions as you approach.

03:33:35.845 --> 03:33:40.217
And you see the familiar head of the-- "(grunts)"

03:33:44.165 --> 03:33:45.375
"Can I help you?"

03:33:45.375 --> 03:33:48.165
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, what's the--?
LIAM: Password.

03:33:48.165 --> 03:33:49.215
MARISHA: We come bearing gifts.

03:33:49.215 --> 03:33:51.865
SAM: Or we come with great gifts or something like that.

03:33:52.865 --> 03:33:55.065
Many gifts, many gifts.

03:33:55.065 --> 03:33:56.155
MATT: "You've got to work on that."

03:33:56.155 --> 03:33:57.465
MARISHA: We offer many gifts?

03:33:57.465 --> 03:33:59.143
SAM: Yeah, something like that.

03:33:59.143 --> 03:34:00.325
We've been here, like, six times.

03:34:00.325 --> 03:34:01.158
LAURA: Come on.

03:34:03.435 --> 03:34:04.894
MATT: "I will cut you."

03:34:04.894 --> 03:34:08.269
(laughter)

03:34:08.269 --> 03:34:09.965
MATT: Turning to the trap door,

03:34:09.965 --> 03:34:12.075
you descend the stairs where you hear

03:34:13.005 --> 03:34:16.955
conversation shifting, the familiar (creak) of wood

03:34:16.955 --> 03:34:21.045
scraping across ground and furniture being shifted.

03:34:21.045 --> 03:34:22.495
There's a big hustle and bustle.

03:34:22.495 --> 03:34:24.605
And as you step down, you can see a bunch of people

03:34:24.605 --> 03:34:27.545
are in the process of cleaning and arranging things.

03:34:27.545 --> 03:34:29.505
As you see the back of The Gentleman,

03:34:29.505 --> 03:34:30.965
he turns around and goes--

03:34:32.889 --> 03:34:34.347
"(nervous, breathy chuckle)"

03:34:36.055 --> 03:34:38.168
Trains his eyes immediately on Marion.

03:34:44.303 --> 03:34:45.136
"Welcome."

03:34:47.563 --> 03:34:48.667
That's where we'll finish the night's game.

03:34:48.667 --> 03:34:52.446
(groaning)
MARISHA: Oh my goodness.

03:34:52.446 --> 03:34:55.371
TRAVIS: (claps, laughs)

03:34:56.301 --> 03:34:57.834
No, you didn't!

03:34:57.834 --> 03:35:00.084
(laughter)

03:35:01.161 --> 03:35:02.495
ASHLEY: "Parent Trap"!
MARISHA: "Parent Trap"!

03:35:02.495 --> 03:35:04.278
MATT: You totally Parent Trapped them,

03:35:04.278 --> 03:35:05.578
I can't believe this shit.

03:35:07.048 --> 03:35:08.365
(laughter)

03:35:08.365 --> 03:35:09.485
LIAM: So anyway the world's ending,

03:35:09.485 --> 03:35:11.870
you got to have her in.

03:35:11.870 --> 03:35:14.612
Da-da da, da-da da!

03:35:16.623 --> 03:35:19.655
MATT: ♪ Complicated weave of things. ♪

03:35:19.655 --> 03:35:22.360
MARISHA: Oh my goodness gracious, what an episode.

03:35:22.360 --> 03:35:23.655
TALIESIN: That was rough.
ASHLEY: Oh god.

03:35:23.655 --> 03:35:26.455
MATT: That was rough. I'm so sorry.

03:35:26.455 --> 03:35:27.975
LIAM: God, all the last game, I was like,

03:35:27.975 --> 03:35:31.145
this game is not letting up.

03:35:31.145 --> 03:35:34.090
Whew, we made it, let's get to the other side.

03:35:34.090 --> 03:35:35.498
(impact sound)
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:35:35.498 --> 03:35:38.315
SAM: That was all same day, right?

03:35:38.315 --> 03:35:39.235
LIAM: Yeah.
MARISHA: Yes!

03:35:39.235 --> 03:35:41.965
SAM: We've been playing this day for three episodes.

03:35:41.965 --> 03:35:45.145
MATT: You've had two very long days nearly back to back.

03:35:45.145 --> 03:35:46.253
MARISHA: Wow.

03:35:46.253 --> 03:35:48.835
LAURA: And you guys didn't get to sleep.

03:35:48.835 --> 03:35:50.135
MATT: No, you have not rested.

03:35:51.185 --> 03:35:52.475
TRAVIS: Don't need it.

03:35:52.475 --> 03:35:53.658
MARISHA: Yeah, still actually doing okay.

03:35:53.658 --> 03:35:54.835
TALIESIN: Actually, yeah. I was going to say,

03:35:54.835 --> 03:35:58.575
because it's still the same day, so they're fine.

03:35:58.575 --> 03:35:59.925
MATT: Honestly, if there was a side of the group

03:35:59.925 --> 03:36:02.165
to not get a full night's rest,

03:36:02.165 --> 03:36:03.595
you three are probably the best choices.

03:36:03.595 --> 03:36:04.745
MARISHA: Still our team, yeah.

03:36:05.633 --> 03:36:07.457
TALIESIN: They're actually not going to suffer any

03:36:07.457 --> 03:36:10.357
consequences for several hours because they didn't--

03:36:10.357 --> 03:36:11.802
MARISHA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:36:11.802 --> 03:36:13.225
MATT: Yeah.

03:36:13.225 --> 03:36:14.615
TALIESIN: Wow, time travel's weird.

03:36:14.615 --> 03:36:15.448
MATT: Yeah, it is.

03:36:16.325 --> 03:36:17.985
Why did I put that in there?

03:36:17.985 --> 03:36:20.415
ASHLEY: That was rough.
TALIESIN: I can't believe that worked.

03:36:20.415 --> 03:36:25.087
SAM: Thank you, guys. Thank you
three for being silent spectators

03:36:25.087 --> 03:36:27.325
for two and a half hours tonight.

03:36:27.325 --> 03:36:28.715
MATT: Yeah, thank you for being patient.

03:36:28.715 --> 03:36:31.147
MARISHA: We had an hour long date, it's fine.

03:36:31.147 --> 03:36:33.346
It all balances out.

03:36:33.346 --> 03:36:38.346
SAM: I think we owe Travis his
own solo episode at this point.

03:36:38.400 --> 03:36:39.341
TRAVIS: What?
MATT: Want to go shopping

03:36:39.341 --> 03:36:40.874
for three hours, Travis?
TRAVIS: No.

03:36:40.874 --> 03:36:42.289
MATT: (cackles)

03:36:42.289 --> 03:36:43.754
TRAVIS: Apparently not any good at that, either.

03:36:43.754 --> 03:36:45.680
(laughter)

03:36:45.680 --> 03:36:47.308
TALIESIN: You're going to get your own cat familiar.

03:36:47.308 --> 03:36:49.425
MATT: Well, we've had some great Fjord spotlights,

03:36:49.425 --> 03:36:51.305
and maybe more for everyone as we go forward.

03:36:51.305 --> 03:36:53.651
So they're fun.
MARISHA: Quest for Vandran!

03:36:54.515 --> 03:36:55.975
Regardless.
TRAVIS: We got to go

03:36:57.325 --> 03:36:58.218
to that dude's place.

03:36:58.218 --> 03:36:59.051
LAURA: Yes, yes.

03:36:59.051 --> 03:37:01.007
SAM: Oh jesus!
LIAM: That's next, yeah.

03:37:01.007 --> 03:37:03.768
MARISHA: You can't say that we're not productive in a day.

03:37:03.768 --> 03:37:04.985
TALIESIN: A lot got done.
MARISHA: We get a lot done.

03:37:04.985 --> 03:37:07.318
SAM: A side quest on aside quest on a side quest.

03:37:08.635 --> 03:37:09.468
TALIESIN: Just stacking.

03:37:09.468 --> 03:37:10.305
TRAVIS: We don't make it easy on ourselves.

03:37:10.305 --> 03:37:11.200
MATT: No, you do not.

03:37:11.200 --> 03:37:12.545
(laughter)

03:37:12.545 --> 03:37:13.425
No, you do not.

03:37:13.425 --> 03:37:16.547
TRAVIS: We'll sneak in and (crunch) (explosion)

03:37:16.547 --> 03:37:19.195
(scared yelling, explosions)

03:37:19.195 --> 03:37:22.010
(laughter)

03:37:22.010 --> 03:37:26.220
MARISHA: It's okay, we just
got to bamf out of here. (poofing)

03:37:26.220 --> 03:37:27.398
ASHLEY: Oh god.

03:37:27.398 --> 03:37:28.725
MATT: Oh boy.

03:37:28.725 --> 03:37:31.555
But that's why I love this game.

03:37:31.555 --> 03:37:34.535
All righty, well, have a wonderful night.

03:37:34.535 --> 03:37:35.845
We love you all very much.

03:37:35.845 --> 03:37:38.665
Thank you for joining us, and is it Thursday yet?

03:37:38.665 --> 03:37:39.498
Good night.

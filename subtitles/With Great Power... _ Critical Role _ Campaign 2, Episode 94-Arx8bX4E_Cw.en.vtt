00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.310
MATT: Hello, everyone and welcome to

2
00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:02.540
tonight's episode of Critical Role

3
00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:03.800
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

4
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.588
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

5
00:00:05.588 --> 00:00:09.780
TRAVIS: (hollering) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

6
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:10.980
MATT: Before we get into tonight's session,

7
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.870
we do have a few announcements to get through,

8
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.290
beginning with the first of our two sponsors,

9
00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.500
beginning tonight with Skillshare.

10
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.510
Sam, if you don't mind.

11
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.250
SAM: Back this week is Skillshare,

12
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.640
an online learning community with tens-- nope,

13
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.170
with thousands of classes on creative

14
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.360
and entrepreneurial skills for the curious mind.

15
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.930
Premium membership gives you unlimited access

16
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.290
on classes from everything from personal productivity

17
00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.190
to art, animation, photography.

18
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.480
Skillshare is affordable, with annual subscriptions

19
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.500
starting as low as 10 bucks a month.

20
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.170
And there's a special on for you Critters,

21
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.948
two month premium membership free--

22
00:00:45.948 --> 00:00:47.959
MARISHA: (echoing) Free, free, free!
SAM: For the first,

23
00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:50.002
for the first 500 people who sign up now

24
00:00:50.002 --> 00:00:54.280
at skl.sh/critcalrole2.

25
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.550
I don't know why, it just is.

26
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:56.660
TRAVIS: The word two or the number two?

27
00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.768
SAM: The number two, it's on the screen.

28
00:00:58.768 --> 00:01:00.508
Now, I checked out their classes

29
00:01:00.508 --> 00:01:02.560
and I noticed they don't have any classes

30
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.350
on the one skill that I'm best at,

31
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.387
being a corporate shill. So tonight,

32
00:01:07.387 --> 00:01:08.530
(laughter)

33
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.160
tonight, I'd like to offer a class called

34
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.261
Online Advertising 101 with Professor Sam Riegel.

35
00:01:14.261 --> 00:01:16.510
(laughter)

36
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.540
(exaggerated posh accent) Greetings, class.

37
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.977
In this seminar-- I don't know how to hold a pipe--

38
00:01:20.977 --> 00:01:22.120
(laughter)

39
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.010
in this seminar, you'll learn the fundamentals

40
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.800
of satisfying sponsorships of tabletop

41
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.394
RPG streaming shows.
TRAVIS: (British accent) Harry Potter.

42
00:01:29.394 --> 00:01:31.120
(laughter)

43
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.710
SAM: There are many ways to do an ad,

44
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.060
but to be a shill for your sponsor,

45
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.820
you must master the pinnacles of the form:

46
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.460
raunchy poems, cheap costumes and fake movie scripts

47
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.688
featuring '90s sitcom icon, Gale.

48
00:01:44.688 --> 00:01:46.970
Lesson one--
LAURA: Fake?

49
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.880
SAM: When brainstorming, always begin with the MATT system.

50
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.040
That's M-A-T-T, it's a mnemonic, a ma-nom-i-conic.

51
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.290
(laughter)

52
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.920
M stands for music.

53
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.260
Buy a cheap rhyming dictionary

54
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.830
and compose a masterpiece like this one:

55
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.480
♪ Pull up a deck chair, pluck out your ear hair, ♪

56
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.118
♪ soil your underwear, Skillshare. ♪

57
00:02:11.118 --> 00:02:11.951
LAURA: Woo!

58
00:02:11.951 --> 00:02:13.060
TRAVIS: Wow!

59
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.710
SAM: That song cost them $700,000.

60
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.960
(laughter)

61
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.060
A of the MATT system stands for accents.

62
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.540
Foreigners love being made fun of.

63
00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.790
For beginners, try Italian.

64
00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.309
TALIESIN: Oh no.
SAM: (terrible Italian accent) Eh, I'm-a from Italy.

65
00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:32.660
I own a Vespa and eat-a the gelato.

66
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.210
I love-a the Skillshare.

67
00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.363
<i>Bon giorno.</i>

68
00:02:35.363 --> 00:02:37.270
TRAVIS: Oh.
ASHLEY: No.

69
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.863
LAURA: That was better than a lot of your other accents.

70
00:02:38.863 --> 00:02:41.580
MARISHA: That was actually pretty good.
TRAVIS: Video game on the fly.

71
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.160
SAM: T of the MATT system stands for-- oh shit, uh, shit,

72
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.920
I--
LAURA: What?

73
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.944
SAM: Uh, shit.

74
00:02:49.944 --> 00:02:51.500
LIAM: Are you missing a prop?
SAM: I was supposed to have a prop.

75
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.000
LAURA: A prop of what?
SAM: I forgot it.

76
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.997
LIAM: Max, Max!
MARISHA: You're supposed to

77
00:02:55.997 --> 00:02:57.900
keep going!
SAM: I'm just going to keep going.

78
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.270
I'm just going to fake it, I'm going to fake it.

79
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.100
LAURA: T stands for what?
SAM: T stands for terrible food.

80
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.260
When in doubt, just be gross like this,

81
00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.340
what was supposed to be a cup of beer and ranch dressing.

82
00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.180
LAURA: Maybe it is.
ASHLEY: Oh thank god it's not here.

83
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.280
SAM: Skillshare.
MATT: That was

84
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.130
so much better, please forget things.

85
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.470
SAM: And the last T of the MATT system is time.

86
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.537
People love long advertisements.

87
00:03:22.537 --> 00:03:25.971
(laughter)

88
00:03:25.971 --> 00:03:28.310
The audience tunes in to find out what will happen after

89
00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.800
their favorite character tricked a witch with a cupcake,

90
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.740
but you, the shill, must stall as long as you can

91
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.600
with ad copy that seems to go on forever, like this one.

92
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.360
Well, that's lesson one.

93
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.240
Future lessons will cover how to piss off

94
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.219
the crew with technical requests, how to--

95
00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:47.499
(laughter)

96
00:03:47.499 --> 00:03:49.130
how to deal with an irate sponsor

97
00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.220
who hates your underwear song, and how to make

98
00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.400
Laura Bailey regret sitting next to you for two years.

99
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.761
Until then, Skillshare.

100
00:03:57.761 --> 00:03:59.180
(applause)

101
00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.013
MATT: Yes.

102
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.400
That was one of the finer--

103
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.590
SAM: I didn't get to drink the beer

104
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.550
and the ranch dressing.
MATT: (sarcastically) Oh no.

105
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:08.383
We're so sad.

106
00:04:08.383 --> 00:04:09.730
TRAVIS: What that would have looked like?

107
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.778
LIAM: That was like seeing Little Women again.

108
00:04:11.778 --> 00:04:14.393
(laughter)

109
00:04:14.393 --> 00:04:15.600
MATT: There you go.

110
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.580
Thank you, Sam, and thank you, Skillshare.

111
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:20.690
For your patience.

112
00:04:21.904 --> 00:04:23.530
(laughs) Our second sponsor tonight

113
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:24.760
are our returning friends for all of

114
00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.340
campaign two of Critical Role, D&amp;D Beyond.

115
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.245
ALL: ♪ D&amp;D Beyond! ♪

116
00:04:29.245 --> 00:04:31.920
MATT: An amazing online tool for digitally keeping track

117
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.790
of your campaigns and/or D&amp;D characters

118
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.410
and all sorts of rules and content.

119
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:36.950
They are amazing, if you haven't checked them out,

120
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.680
you can go ahead and do so at dndbeyond,

121
00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.787
that's D-N-D beyond.link/criticalrole.

122
00:04:43.787 --> 00:04:46.702
ASHLEY: ♪ You got your perfect warlock. ♪
MATT: That one.

123
00:04:46.702 --> 00:04:49.248
Thank you, Ashley, for your support on that one.

124
00:04:49.248 --> 00:04:51.248
(laughter)

125
00:04:51.248 --> 00:04:53.293
TRAVIS: The spirit moving ya, it's moving ya.

126
00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:56.360
Got to let it move through you.

127
00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.032
MATT: You got to let it carry.

128
00:04:58.032 --> 00:05:00.650
TALIESIN: Yeah.
LAURA: Yes.

129
00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:01.483
MATT: It is.

130
00:05:01.483 --> 00:05:04.877
SAM: It's the lyric and I love that tune even more.

131
00:05:04.877 --> 00:05:06.178
MATT: It is.

132
00:05:06.178 --> 00:05:07.011
So,

133
00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:09.580
next up, we announced today,

134
00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.790
as part of uploading our new Handbooker Helper

135
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.670
for the Monsterhearts 2 game.

136
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.300
MARISHA: Out of the blue.
MATT: Yep, out of the blue.

137
00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.133
That's what we do.

138
00:05:18.133 --> 00:05:19.350
For those not familiar, Monsterhearts is

139
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.690
a great game system that deals with the

140
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.380
angsty teenage experience but you're also secretly monsters.

141
00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.840
It's really fun, it's a really unique form

142
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.290
of really narrative-heavy role playing game.

143
00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.500
We put up our new Handbooker Helper about it

144
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.280
and we are doing a Valentine's Day one-shot that'll be

145
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.940
coming out next Friday for you guys to check out.

146
00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:38.773
Super excited about it.

147
00:05:38.773 --> 00:05:40.950
At 7:00 p.m. here on our Twitch channel and then

148
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.820
it'll be available on our YouTube shortly thereafter,

149
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.110
but for those of you who are either staying in

150
00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:49.370
for Valentine's Day or want to go ahead

151
00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.030
and check it out after the weekend or thereafter.

152
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:52.670
Looking forward to it, it's going to be a lot of fun.

153
00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:55.061
I'm the Master of Ceremonies for it, the MC,

154
00:05:55.061 --> 00:05:57.320
and we have a wonderful cast that includes right here,

155
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.600
our wonderful Taliesin Jaffe and Ashley Johnson.

156
00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.030
Joining us, we have our longtime friend and amazing person

157
00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.560
Erika Ishii.
MARISHA: Yeah!

158
00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.920
MATT: And joining, for the first time,

159
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.770
the Critical Role family, our friend Ally Beardsley.

160
00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:10.090
They are an amazing role player you may know

161
00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:12.850
from Dimension 20 as well as CollegeHumor.

162
00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:14.860
They are fantastic and we're so happy to have them aboard,

163
00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.420
so check that out next week at 7:00 p.m.

164
00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.620
on our Twitch channel here on Critical Role.

165
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:22.710
Marisha, you have an announcement.

166
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.180
MARISHA: Speaking of content, if you want more of

167
00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.640
Sam aimlessly talking into microphones,

168
00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.320
you need to watch All Work No Play. Liam is there, too.

169
00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.880
TRAVIS: We need to take that math course.

170
00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.900
MARISHA: Yeah, I do need to take that.

171
00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.958
I'm an independent creator, not a corporate shill, so.

172
00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.260
(laughter)

173
00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.050
MARISHA: Sorry I don't have a polished language.

174
00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.097
I produce art.

175
00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:51.510
Like All Work No Play!
SAM: Oh!

176
00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:53.750
MARISHA: So yes, the first episode is

177
00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:55.770
available right now on YouTube.

178
00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:58.545
It's Sam and Liam made chainsaw art?
ASHLEY: It's so good!

179
00:06:58.545 --> 00:06:59.640
TRAVIS: Shit is so funny.

180
00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.590
LIAM: I had the same reaction watching it

181
00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.490
that I did with our earliest podcast episodes,

182
00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.730
where when we did it, I'm like, "This is not that good."

183
00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:08.277
And then I watch it and I'm like,

184
00:07:08.277 --> 00:07:09.440
"Hey, this is pretty good."
MARISHA: It's good!

185
00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.988
(laughter)

186
00:07:10.988 --> 00:07:14.510
MARISHA: Well, Julie Nathanson really steals the show.

187
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:16.360
She kind of makes it.
TALIESIN: Definitely carries it.

188
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.172
LIAM: Her muscles, anyway.
MARISHA: Linda Hamilton arms.

189
00:07:18.172 --> 00:07:19.820
LAURA: Fucking arms, right?
ASHLEY: Yeah.

190
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.400
MARISHA: Her in that purple tank top?

191
00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.080
LAURA: Oh my god.
ASHLEY: I immediately

192
00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.205
started doing push ups

193
00:07:25.205 --> 00:07:26.686
while watching the episode.

194
00:07:26.686 --> 00:07:29.743
LIAM: Sarah Connor level--
ASHLEY: Sarah Connor level, yeah.

195
00:07:29.743 --> 00:07:30.910
TRAVIS: And then pull ups.

196
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:35.540
MARISHA: Before I objectify my good friend Julie Nathanson,

197
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:37.630
yeah, you should catch it right now

198
00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:39.340
and the next episode will air

199
00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:42.935
Tuesday, February 18th at 4:00 p.m.

200
00:07:42.935 --> 00:07:44.532
LAURA: Ooh.
SAM: That's not this upcoming Tuesday--

201
00:07:44.532 --> 00:07:45.365
MARISHA: Not this Tuesday.

202
00:07:45.365 --> 00:07:46.790
SAM: The next one.
MARISHA: Next Tuesday.

203
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:48.454
SAM: That's right.
MATT: Gotcha. Cool.

204
00:07:48.454 --> 00:07:49.287
SAM: Thanks, Marish.

205
00:07:49.287 --> 00:07:50.780
LIAM: Was that your Italian accent?

206
00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:52.870
MARISHA: Couldn't you tell?

207
00:07:54.052 --> 00:07:55.370
TRAVIS and MATT: Oh hello.

208
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:56.810
(laughter)

209
00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.630
MATT: Five years later, still fresh off the noggin.

210
00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:00.840
TALIESIN: What's going on over there?

211
00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.470
I'm a little worried about Italy now.

212
00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:04.400
It's like, everybody okay?

213
00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:07.290
I don't know, what sounds so weird?

214
00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:09.492
LIAM: A-next-a Tuesday.

215
00:08:09.492 --> 00:08:11.024
MATT: (Mario accent) Let's-a go.

216
00:08:11.024 --> 00:08:12.245
All right, moving on.

217
00:08:12.245 --> 00:08:13.935
(laughter)

218
00:08:13.935 --> 00:08:15.320
MATT: Laura! Laura, you've got some announcements, too.

219
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.810
LAURA: Woo, I do.
TALIESIN: Oh man.

220
00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:20.340
LAURA: First of all, we got new stuff in our stores,

221
00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:22.270
the US shop and the UK shop.

222
00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:25.230
Let's cut to this fabulous--
SAM: Cut to?

223
00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:26.063
Oh.
LAURA: Keychain.

224
00:08:26.063 --> 00:08:27.130
Yeah, I think they've got it on

225
00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:28.310
the table so that you can get a better shot.

226
00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:29.650
TALIESIN: Oh, look at that.

227
00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:32.020
(oohing)
LAURA: I don't know if it's on the, I don't know.

228
00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:34.000
But yeah, it's this beautiful, and it spins.

229
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:34.833
MARISHA: Yeah, do the demonstration.

230
00:08:34.833 --> 00:08:36.340
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to take it, I'm going to pull it out.

231
00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:37.173
TALIESIN: Take it, take it.

232
00:08:37.173 --> 00:08:38.580
SAM: Cut to the other camera.

233
00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.550
TALIESIN: There you go.
LAURA: I'm going to take it.

234
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:42.650
Look, ooh.
SAM: Okay.

235
00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:45.803
LAURA: It spins.
ALL: Whoa.

236
00:08:45.803 --> 00:08:47.230
LAURA: Oh, this one isn't--
TRAVIS: Spinners, y'all.

237
00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:48.780
LAURA: Hold on, I'm not doing it very well. There.

238
00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:50.446
SAM: You're blocking it with your thumb.
LAURA: Shut up!

239
00:08:50.446 --> 00:08:54.150
Anyway, it spins and it's got this fabulous copper finish.

240
00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:55.588
Anyway, I like it.

241
00:08:55.588 --> 00:08:58.440
(laughter)

242
00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.314
ASHLEY: Good sale.
TALIESIN: Wow.

243
00:08:59.314 --> 00:09:01.611
MATT: There you go, there you go.

244
00:09:01.611 --> 00:09:02.960
LAURA: There it is.

245
00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.240
SAM: It's copper style.
LAURA: It's copper style, yeah.

246
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.884
ASHLEY: It's copper.
LAURA: ♪ Do-do do do-do do doo! ♪

247
00:09:09.884 --> 00:09:11.526
(cheering)

248
00:09:11.526 --> 00:09:12.700
LAURA: ♪ Do doo! ♪

249
00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.870
This is-- wait, where's the logo? There it is.

250
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:19.418
This is called Bailey's Dice Bag of Hoarding.

251
00:09:20.506 --> 00:09:22.060
MARISHA: It's the size of your head.

252
00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:23.850
LAURA: Dee dee.
TRAVIS: It's bigger.

253
00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:26.940
LAURA: Yeah, so this was a bag that was inspired by

254
00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.550
the bags made for several of us.

255
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:31.110
I don't know if she's made everyone a bag,

256
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:32.870
but only the ones that she really loves.

257
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:35.340
Chrissy Ahrens, I hope I'm saying your last name right.

258
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:40.340
She's on Twitter at @marajade33082 and she's wonderful.

259
00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:42.720
She does custom bags and everything, so.

260
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.400
Other people do custom bags as well.

261
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.880
But ours--
SAM: Now we do custom bags.

262
00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:47.340
LAURA: Well, ours is not custom.
SAM: Well.

263
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:49.040
LAURA: But it's beautiful and it's got

264
00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.770
these fabulous lining-- anyway.

265
00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:52.980
MARISHA: Oh yeah, the lining is super cute.

266
00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:54.090
LIAM: With the Wendy doodles.
LAURA: The Wendy doodles.

267
00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:55.590
ASHLEY: With the thing in the
middle that you can hold it, too.

268
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:57.160
LAURA: Yeah, and it's got a wonderful bag,

269
00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.360
oh hold on, look at this.

270
00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.370
And it'll hold lots and lots of dice.

271
00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:04.530
I know because I put everything from my dice bag in here

272
00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:05.571
to make sure--
TRAVIS: That looks super durable.

273
00:10:05.571 --> 00:10:07.922
Can I use that for all my hardware needs at home?

274
00:10:07.922 --> 00:10:08.764
SAM: Oh, that's right.

275
00:10:08.764 --> 00:10:10.190
(laughter)

276
00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:12.030
SAM: Fellas, you could keep nails in there.

277
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:13.790
LAURA: It's got a super sturdy bottom, though,

278
00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:16.330
so it won't lose its shape.
SAM: Screws and nails.

279
00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:18.710
LAURA: Anyway, I love it.

280
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:19.590
Check it out.

281
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:23.130
And also, for anybody that's going to C2E2,

282
00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:25.430
people have been asking me if our merch is going to be there

283
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:27.110
and we are not going to be selling it personally,

284
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:31.500
but a lot of our stuff will be at the C2E2 merch booth,

285
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.200
so you can go there and get some--

286
00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.720
SAM: At the C2E2 merch booth?

287
00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.060
LAURA: Did I say that right?
TRAVIS: Yeah.

288
00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:37.060
SAM: Is that right?
LAURA: Yeah.

289
00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:38.430
It's at the C2E2 merch booth.
SAM: Okay.

290
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:40.030
TRAVIS: Actual convention merch.
LAURA: Yeah.

291
00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:42.747
MATT: You instill Laura with insecurity on camera.
SAM: No, I just never heard of such a thing.

292
00:10:42.747 --> 00:10:43.580
LAURA: Yeah, it's pretty cool.

293
00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:44.670
SAM: There's a merch booth there? Cool.

294
00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:46.220
LAURA: Yeah, they sell the con stuff,

295
00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:47.920
but they are also going to sell our stuff.

296
00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.937
MARISHA: Have their big booth where you can go--
SAM: I don't go to cons.

297
00:10:50.937 --> 00:10:52.890
LAURA: Shut up.
SAM: I don't know things.

298
00:10:54.007 --> 00:10:54.890
LAURA: I'm debating.

299
00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:56.890
I don't know whether to keep it in my custom bag

300
00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:00.350
or pour some in-- maybe I'll just put the ones that are

301
00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:02.870
in my other bag in this one.
MARISHA: You have plenty.

302
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:04.870
TALIESIN: You can get smaller dice bags--
TRAVIS: Did you hear that?

303
00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:05.820
Someone beside me,

304
00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.230
speaking truth, slinging it.
LAURA: What'd you say, Marisha?

305
00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:09.220
TRAVIS: You don't have to fill it up.

306
00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:11.020
MARISHA: Nothing, I didn't say anything, it was Travis.

307
00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:12.934
Travis said everything.

308
00:11:12.934 --> 00:11:14.192
It was Travis.
TRAVIS: Hide quickly, the laser beams.

309
00:11:14.192 --> 00:11:16.240
SAM: Matt, I think it's back to you, brother.

310
00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.980
MATT: I think it might be.

311
00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:21.380
Thank you, Laura.
LAURA: Thank you, Matt.

312
00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:24.250
MATT: And I believe that marks the end

313
00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:27.250
of all of our announcements and as such,

314
00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:28.330

(dragon roaring)

352
00:13:09.908 --> 00:13:11.852
MATT: You guys were so late on the draw that time.

353
00:13:11.852 --> 00:13:13.531
TALIESIN: (groans)

354
00:13:13.531 --> 00:13:14.855
MATT: Welcome back.

355
00:13:14.855 --> 00:13:18.780
So last we left off,

356
00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:23.500
The Mighty Nein, in discovering that the curse

357
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:27.460
that still holds Nott in her goblinoid form

358
00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:30.670
after her initial transformation years ago remained

359
00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:35.520
and apparently was still held by the same magical woman

360
00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:38.480
that had originally imposed this curse upon her.

361
00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.298
You traveled your way through Kamordah,

362
00:13:40.298 --> 00:13:45.298
had a tense experience meeting the Lionett family,

363
00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:48.660
who also has attachments to this entity, who

364
00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:51.970
you came to discover was named as Isharnai the Prism Sage,

365
00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:55.740
who lived to the northern forest marshlands

366
00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:59.980
amongst the bases around Mount Mentiri.

367
00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:03.441
You traversed this dangerous landscape,

368
00:14:03.441 --> 00:14:05.399
dealing with various pockets

369
00:14:05.399 --> 00:14:09.360
of unleashed acidic moisture

370
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:14.360
and steam bursting forth from the geothermal ground itself.

371
00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:18.620
You lost a few horses and let the others wander.

372
00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:19.560
You made your way through swamps

373
00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.820
and got lost, got exhausted,

374
00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:24.140
dealt with fighting a few gorefeather harpies,

375
00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:25.270
and then eventually found your way

376
00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:27.810
to the base of Mount Mentiri, to the exterior

377
00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:31.382
of the abode of Isharnai just as the sun set.

378
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:35.240
Upon looking around, you eventually discovered

379
00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.690
this creature invisible on the roof

380
00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:39.830
watching you all as you were

381
00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:43.720
just investigating her homestead,

382
00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.450
after which you had some conversations with her,

383
00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:49.590
discovered that she could offer many things,

384
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:51.280
just like she has in the past,

385
00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.930
in exchange for a touch of your own fortune.

386
00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:55.660
Seemed to thrive on misery

387
00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:58.050
for those who ask for too much.

388
00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:02.650
After some very emotional conversations

389
00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:06.530
and thoughts about what some of you are willing to sacrifice

390
00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:10.130
to trade for this curse that still remained on Nott,

391
00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:16.870
Jester bamboozled her,

392
00:15:17.046 --> 00:15:19.540
and me,

393
00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:23.130
through a clutch combination of Dust of Deliciousness,

394
00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:24.310
a random magical item I made up

395
00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:26.294
and gave you back in episode 30--

396
00:15:26.294 --> 00:15:27.835
(laughter)

397
00:15:27.835 --> 00:15:30.820
MATT: -- and used it to modify the memory of her,

398
00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:33.980
to convince this crone-type creature

399
00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:35.190
that she had such an amazing time

400
00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:38.740
and you guys bonded so quickly and in this time,

401
00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:42.690
she just was happy to release it for your companionship.

402
00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:45.750
And you left, walked outside into the dark night

403
00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:48.630
as you were all tired and wondering what happened,

404
00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:52.320
to have Jester go, "Go, we have to go, now."

405
00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.270
As you all were quickly ushered off

406
00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:58.020
this somewhat moss-covered darkened hut,

407
00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:00.700
the dull interior candlelit glow

408
00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:04.160
that pours through the partially ajar doorway.

409
00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:08.230
You all spearhead downward, back into the swampy valley

410
00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:11.410
that awaits you as night has just begun.

411
00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:14.490
And that is where we left off.

412
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:17.400
As Jester is quickly ushering you

413
00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.370
down into the darkness, what do you do?

414
00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:20.650
SAM: Quick, quickly.
LIAM: Why, why are we--

415
00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:23.553
SAM: Cast Find the Path.
LAURA: Oh.

416
00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:25.510
I don't have that prepared.

417
00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:27.008
SAM: Okay, great.

418
00:16:27.008 --> 00:16:28.123
TALIESIN: What's Find the Path?

419
00:16:28.123 --> 00:16:30.659
LAURA: It's a spell so I can find a path.

420
00:16:30.659 --> 00:16:32.610
But I thought, you know, she'd be dead and we

421
00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:36.140
wouldn't have to be hurrying or anything like that, so.

422
00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:39.200
Caleb, Caleb, just teleport us away from here.

423
00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:43.300
LIAM: Oh, I, uh, oh.
MARISHA: What happened, though?

424
00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:44.490
What happened?
TRAVIS: What do you mean, "Oh"?

425
00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:45.860
LAURA: You are saying this as we're walking,

426
00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:47.690
right, we're going through the brambles now.

427
00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:51.026
MARISHA: Hang on though, because wait, though, what?

428
00:16:51.026 --> 00:16:52.183
LAURA: Wait, what?
SAM: Oh yeah.

429
00:16:52.183 --> 00:16:53.196
What happened?

430
00:16:53.196 --> 00:16:54.154
Are we okay?

431
00:16:54.154 --> 00:16:55.090
ASHLEY: Kill her or anything?
SAM: What happened?

432
00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:57.100
LAURA: Everything's fine.
SAM: Did you give up something?

433
00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:01.623
LAURA: Something, yeah, like real sprecial.

434
00:17:01.623 --> 00:17:04.142
(laughter)

435
00:17:04.142 --> 00:17:05.644
ASHLEY: A real sprecial?
LAURA: Yeah, it's a real sprecial.

436
00:17:05.644 --> 00:17:07.518
ASHLEY: What's a sprecial?

437
00:17:07.518 --> 00:17:10.530
SAM: Sprinkle's name.
LIAM: It's an Indian dish.

438
00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:11.600
Shpretzies are the best.

439
00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:13.590
MARISHA: You made shpretzle out of Sprinkle?

440
00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:16.140
LAURA: No, Sprinkle's fine, look.
MARISHA: Oh.

441
00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:18.192
ASHLEY: What's a sprecial?

442
00:17:18.192 --> 00:17:19.472
(giggling)

443
00:17:19.472 --> 00:17:21.205
MATT: (sighs)

444
00:17:21.205 --> 00:17:23.934
MARISHA: He has no hair, Jester.
LAURA: What?

445
00:17:23.934 --> 00:17:25.260
I'm going to get some food out

446
00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:28.398
and just feed Sprinkle as we talk.

447
00:17:28.398 --> 00:17:30.660
(laughter)

448
00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:33.140
LAURA: He's eating, it's, he's fine.

449
00:17:34.134 --> 00:17:36.898
LIAM: (gagging)
LAURA: It's like beef jerky, it's fine.

450
00:17:36.898 --> 00:17:38.000
TRAVIS: Peanut allergy.
MARISHA: So dry.

451
00:17:39.038 --> 00:17:40.455
It won't go down.

452
00:17:41.582 --> 00:17:42.856
LIAM: This is a show about a weasel.

453
00:17:42.856 --> 00:17:45.106
(laughter)

454
00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.040
SAM: Wait, are we in danger?

455
00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.320
Do we need to run?

456
00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.720
TALIESIN: We are moving apace, aren't we?

457
00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:51.850
Yeah, we are moving apace.
MATT: You are.

458
00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:56.630
LAURA: I maybe, I'd rather not say this right now.

459
00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:58.620
Like, you know, I gave away something

460
00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:00.880
really special and shit's fine, it's fine.

461
00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:04.576
We should just go because I don't want to, like--

462
00:18:04.576 --> 00:18:05.409
MARISHA: Is Nott good, though?

463
00:18:05.409 --> 00:18:06.490
LIAM: Yeah, are we taken care of here, or--

464
00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:07.940
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, everything's fine.

465
00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:10.440
Nott, your curse is broken.
MARISHA: Is my brother good?

466
00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:12.710
LAURA: What do you mean?

467
00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:15.725
She said she-- What did--?
MARISHA: I don't know,

468
00:18:15.725 --> 00:18:17.627
I had some questions.
LAURA: You didn't make a deal, did you?

469
00:18:17.627 --> 00:18:18.460
MARISHA: No.

470
00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:20.420
LAURA: Then your brother's fine.

471
00:18:21.295 --> 00:18:23.093
Right?

472
00:18:23.093 --> 00:18:24.070
TRAVIS: What, what do you mean?

473
00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:25.050
What do you mean your brother?

474
00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:27.610
MARISHA: No, just keep going.
TRAVIS: Okay, so we need to go.

475
00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:30.170
It's fine, Nott is good.
LAURA: Go, get walking.

476
00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:34.330
TRAVIS: And Caleb, you said "oh"
earlier to the teleport request?

477
00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:36.680
LIAM: No, I do not have that ready.

478
00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.370
TALIESIN: Wait, oh.

479
00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:40.000
Okay, oh.
LAURA: Can you,

480
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:40.990
do you have Find the Path,

481
00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:43.280
can you find us a path?
TALIESIN: No, I can definitely--

482
00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:44.860
TRAVIS: I thought you found the path before.

483
00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:47.800
LAURA: I did but, you know, I prepare some spells at

484
00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:50.380
the beginning of the day and I didn't prepare that one.

485
00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.010
TALIESIN: Keep an eye on things behind us.

486
00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:53.870
SAM: Yeah, I'm going to look behind us.

487
00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:56.110
MATT: Perception check, both of you.
LAURA: Because I thought we would be fighting and so

488
00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:59.081
I prepared, like, a heal spell instead.

489
00:18:59.081 --> 00:19:00.350
Because, you know, I heal.
TALIESIN: 22.

490
00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:02.150
LIAM: We have a certain way of doing things.

491
00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:03.990
Normally we raze things to the ground,

492
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:07.560
so I did not think that we would need to escape in a hurry.

493
00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:09.540
TRAVIS: Yep, no, that's true.
LIAM: So.

494
00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:10.980
TRAVIS: Yep.
LIAM: I came prepared

495
00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:13.800
to fuck shit up, but I cannot get us out.

496
00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:14.820
TRAVIS: Yeah, you know,

497
00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:17.570
act as if, basically, we just walk like,

498
00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:20.280
you know, you traded something that she loved--

499
00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:21.760
LAURA: I did.
TRAVIS: And Nott's fine

500
00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.542
and we're going to make our way out
of here like we did before.

501
00:19:23.542 --> 00:19:26.420
LAURA: Yeah, we're walking away confidently and happily

502
00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:28.220
and knowing that--
LIAM: The deal is closed.

503
00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:30.509
Why do we need to rush, though?

504
00:19:30.509 --> 00:19:32.318
LAURA: Well, um--

505
00:19:32.318 --> 00:19:33.660
MATT: (hooting)

506
00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:36.310
You hear the nocturnal creatures are starting to come out.

507
00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:39.990
The night has definitely claimed the dense forest

508
00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:42.260
as you guys feel the ground beneath you at this point

509
00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:43.940
beginning to turn a little softer,

510
00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:46.310
then the moisture of the swamp approaching.

511
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:48.220
You do not see anything immediately behind you

512
00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:50.050
beyond just the occasional dark shadow

513
00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:52.940
of some sort of nocturnal flight bird or predator

514
00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:55.550
finding its way out for an early evening bite.

515
00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:58.930
LAURA: The thing that I gave her, you know,

516
00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:03.480
I've never actually given before or used, so--

517
00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:04.410
SAM: What did you give her?

518
00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:07.460
LAURA: I gave her--
MARISHA: Did you kiss her?

519
00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:09.450
LAURA: Yeah, I gave her a real big smooch

520
00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:12.005
and she loved it. She was like, "Oh my god."
TRAVIS: We don't believe you, Jester.

521
00:20:12.005 --> 00:20:13.955
Will you tell us what you gave her, please?

522
00:20:13.955 --> 00:20:15.390
TALIESIN: I hadn't even gotten to that.

523
00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:17.460
LAURA: I gave her a cupcake.

524
00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:19.243
My last one, I gave her my last cupcake.
TRAVIS: What did you really give her?

525
00:20:19.243 --> 00:20:20.710
LAURA: I gave her a cupcake.

526
00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:21.980
SAM and ASHLEY: That was enough?

527
00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:23.105
LAURA: Yep, yeah.

528
00:20:23.105 --> 00:20:24.821
TRAVIS: How could a cupcake possibly be enough?

529
00:20:24.821 --> 00:20:26.290
SAM: I don't feel any different.

530
00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:28.224
You're telling me that--
TRAVIS: Nott was prepared to give war.

531
00:20:28.224 --> 00:20:29.573
SAM: -- the curse has been lifted on me?

532
00:20:29.573 --> 00:20:30.480
Do I look different?

533
00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:33.300
LAURA: I was in the room and the whole room went dark

534
00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:36.670
and she waved her hand and she said the curse was broken.

535
00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:39.820
The whole room went really, like,

536
00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:41.670
magically dark, you know what I mean?

537
00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:44.938
And I believed her.

538
00:20:44.938 --> 00:20:46.090
SAM: You believe her?

539
00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:46.923
LAURA: Yeah.

540
00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:49.990
Yeah.
SAM: Well, thank you.

541
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:52.390
LIAM: Well, I suppose if it's not true,

542
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:53.790
we could always double back?

543
00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:56.680
LAURA: What?
TALIESIN: That's fair.

544
00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:58.250
LAURA: Why don't we just make the hut or something--

545
00:20:58.250 --> 00:20:59.730
TRAVIS: Oh, finish the job? Yeah.

546
00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:00.830
It doesn't seem like a deal

547
00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:02.530
would be concluded with a cupcake.

548
00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:05.760
Maybe we should take care of this ourselves.

549
00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:08.043
TALIESIN: Well, let's, let's--

550
00:21:08.893 --> 00:21:10.142
LAURA: You don't trust me?

551
00:21:10.142 --> 00:21:11.230
SAM: I trust you.
TRAVIS: No, I trust you,

552
00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:13.837
I just don't believe--
LAURA: You just don't believe me?

553
00:21:13.837 --> 00:21:15.710
You don't believe me that I would know the difference

554
00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:18.110
if a curse was broken and a deal was made?

555
00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:20.080
TRAVIS: How would she break a curse that's been

556
00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:23.130
hanging over Nott for years over a cupcake?

557
00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:25.113
ASHLEY: What flavor was the cupcake?

558
00:21:25.113 --> 00:21:26.800
LAURA: It was blueberry.

559
00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:29.202
TALIESIN: I mean, I'll do a lot for a blueberry cupcake.
ASHLEY: Okay.

560
00:21:29.202 --> 00:21:31.650
TRAVIS: It's been a minute since
you've gotten any new cupcakes.

561
00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:34.083
How old was that cupcake?

562
00:21:34.083 --> 00:21:36.565
LAURA: It was pretty old.

563
00:21:36.565 --> 00:21:37.623
TRAVIS: What are we missing?

564
00:21:37.623 --> 00:21:41.200
LAURA: The frosting was, like, real stale.

565
00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.630
I tasted it.
LIAM: To be fair,

566
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:45.080
she probably eats, you know, earthworms and--

567
00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:47.070
LAURA: Exactly.
LIAM: Fungus and stuff.

568
00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:48.555
SAM: This is all very confusing.

569
00:21:48.555 --> 00:21:51.470
LAURA: Plus it had some of that stuff that Pumat gave us.

570
00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:53.400
SAM: We need to get somewhere safe so we can talk this out.

571
00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:54.860
MARISHA: Wait, what was that last part?

572
00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:57.205
LAURA: You know, that stuff?
TALIESIN: No.

573
00:21:57.205 --> 00:22:01.100
LAURA: The dust that, remember, we talked about and makes

574
00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:02.749
food taste really good.
TALIESIN: Oh. Oh!

575
00:22:02.749 --> 00:22:03.810
Oh that, oh that.
LAURA: Yeah.

576
00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:05.990
TALIESIN: Oh that, oh.
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

577
00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:06.980
TALIESIN: Oh.
TRAVIS: What about it?

578
00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:09.400
LAURA: It made it taste good.

579
00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:11.295
LIAM: Pretty damn good.
LAURA: Can I look behind us?

580
00:22:11.295 --> 00:22:13.660
Is anything following us?
MATT: Make a perception check.

581
00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:15.735
TALIESIN: I'll join you. I'm going to keep doing this.

582
00:22:15.735 --> 00:22:17.380
LAURA: I don't care, I'm going to look anyway again.

583
00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:18.213
TALIESIN: 27.

584
00:22:18.213 --> 00:22:19.900
LAURA: Ooh, you saw way more than me.

585
00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:21.020
17.

586
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:23.440
MATT: For the time being, no.

587
00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:25.660
You don't notice anything behind you.

588
00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:29.420
The air is cold and the mist is rising in the swamp

589
00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:31.040
as you guys begin to now hit

590
00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:33.450
the elements of the mud and water

591
00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:35.777
that you're now ankle deep and you can hear the

592
00:22:35.777 --> 00:22:36.901
(squelching).

593
00:22:36.901 --> 00:22:38.138
LAURA: You guys, this is probably dangerous

594
00:22:38.138 --> 00:22:40.063
to traverse in the night.

595
00:22:40.063 --> 00:22:42.327
SAM: Should we go in the hut

596
00:22:42.327 --> 00:22:44.580
and just camouflage ourselves?

597
00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:46.300
TRAVIS: Well, it's soggy.
MARISHA: Maybe.

598
00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:47.770
TRAVIS: I don't really know if there's--

599
00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:50.040
MARISHA: Why don't we find solid ground first?

600
00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:52.520
TALIESIN: Let's find somewhere to put the hut,

601
00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:53.710
maybe off the beaten track

602
00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:56.005
MARISHA: We need to do the ritual for Nott.

603
00:22:56.005 --> 00:22:58.700
LIAM: Oh, oh boy.

604
00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:00.532
It has been a week, you guys.
MARISHA: Do you have stuff?

605
00:23:00.532 --> 00:23:02.320
Do we need to start collecting clay?

606
00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.090
LIAM: Yeah.
SAM: Wait, not that ritual.

607
00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:07.080
LAURA: No, no, no. What?
LIAM: She is talking about Nott's ritual, but--

608
00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:09.060
LAURA: No, let's-- that takes, like, an hour.

609
00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:10.977
LIAM: We do that at home, I think. Right?

610
00:23:10.977 --> 00:23:13.149
LAURA: Let's make the hut.
SAM: Not while we're running, no.

611
00:23:13.149 --> 00:23:15.500
MARISHA: What if it's not broken?

612
00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:17.141
LAURA: It's broken, Beau.

613
00:23:17.141 --> 00:23:19.017
MARISHA: How, though?

614
00:23:19.017 --> 00:23:21.590
LAURA: I'll tell you if we get the hut up, okay?

615
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:23.360
I'll talk to you guys in the hut, Beau.

616
00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.737
LIAM: Well, let's a bit of dry ground if we're able to.

617
00:23:25.737 --> 00:23:27.748
TRAVIS: Sure, yeah, okay.
LIAM: 10 to 15 feet.

618
00:23:27.748 --> 00:23:30.290
LAURA: Can we search around for solid ground?
MATT: Make a survival check.

619
00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:31.831
SAM: Survival.

620
00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:34.850
TRAVIS: ♪ You're a survivor ♪
LAURA: Just me?

621
00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:38.050
Did anybody give me Guidance?

622
00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:41.560
Any advantage because people are also, ooh.

623
00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:45.180
20--

624
00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:49.030
what is that, 23 plus a d4.

625
00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:51.970
MATT: Damn, Jester.
LAURA: 26.

626
00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:54.170
MATT: 26, okay.
TALIESIN: That was one hell of a roll.

627
00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:59.170
MATT: All right, you go ahead and it takes you about an hour

628
00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:01.380
because you either have to get
really far off the beaten path

629
00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:02.920
or you have to push forward and you're like,

630
00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:06.200
going forward, there's a chance you might find--

631
00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:08.470
it's easier to find things that break the surface when

632
00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:11.741
it's not as shallow, but also, you're off the beaten path

633
00:24:11.741 --> 00:24:14.020
and you know where you've traveled and the safest,

634
00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.180
or at least the most immediate, distance

635
00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:17.690
between where you are and where you're going.

636
00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:19.040
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: It takes about an hour

637
00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.730
before you find a patch of land that is

638
00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:25.080
mostly above water and can probably fit the dome in it.

639
00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:27.860
There is one issue is a quarter of it would be

640
00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:32.280
filled with part of a fallen, rotted trunk of a tree,

641
00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:34.130
which means you'll have to be pretty
tight in there when you sleep,

642
00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:35.680
but it's doable.

643
00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:37.997
LAURA: We'll squish in.
SAM: The dome would be around the tree trunk?

644
00:24:37.997 --> 00:24:39.370
MATT: Yes.
LAURA: That's fine.

645
00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:40.950
MATT: Unless one of you want to sleep in the water.

646
00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:43.382
MARISHA: Nope.
TRAVIS: Hollowed out tree trunk or solid?

647
00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:47.180
LIAM: Is it a fun straw into our home?

648
00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:49.520
LAURA: No, because the dome would go through the hut,

649
00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:51.270
right? Go through the trunk, anyway.

650
00:24:53.669 --> 00:24:55.640
MATT: The trunk would be inside the dome

651
00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:58.770
as far as getting enough ground that is open

652
00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:02.340
and not under water and under the actual

653
00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:05.720
marsh water, but it is not hollow

654
00:25:06.598 --> 00:25:07.931
and it is rotted.

655
00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:10.160
You go to inspect it and you pull it

656
00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:12.349
and the jagged parts

657
00:25:12.349 --> 00:25:14.983
peel off softly.
LAURA: Can we just move the trunk?

658
00:25:14.983 --> 00:25:16.500
MATT: It's rooted in the ground.

659
00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:17.360
You can try and move it up if you

660
00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.660
want to try and tear the trunk out.

661
00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:19.510
SAM: Just sleep around it.

662
00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:21.460
It'll be uncomfortable but safe.

663
00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:22.810
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: How long does it take

664
00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:24.800
for you to cast it as a ritual?

665
00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:26.976
LIAM: 11 minutes as a ritual.

666
00:25:26.976 --> 00:25:29.510
MARISHA: Should we try and push the trunk for 11 minutes?

667
00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:31.850
LAURA: Yeah, for 11 minutes, we'll try to move it.

668
00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:33.980
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make a-- who's helming this?

669
00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:35.870
MARISHA: I help the girls.
MATT: Oh, the girls are doing it?

670
00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:36.703
LAURA: and ASHLEY: Yeah.

671
00:25:36.703 --> 00:25:37.670
MARISHA: You two are strength-based.

672
00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:39.345
MATT: Yeah, so both you guys make
strength checks for me, please.

673
00:25:39.345 --> 00:25:41.148
ASHLEY: Okay.
MARISHA: And I am

674
00:25:41.148 --> 00:25:43.023
there for emotional support.
LAURA: Guidance.

675
00:25:43.023 --> 00:25:44.023
TALIESIN: I'm watching,

676
00:25:44.023 --> 00:25:46.006
I'm watching for anything.

677
00:25:46.006 --> 00:25:47.006
ASHLEY: Natural 20.

678
00:25:47.006 --> 00:25:48.773
LAURA: Oh shit.
ALL: Whoa!

679
00:25:48.773 --> 00:25:53.180
LAURA: And I got a 27.
MATT: Woo!

680
00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:55.080
SAM: Wow.
MATT: Damn.

681
00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:57.072
TALIESIN: 20 on perception, too, just keeping an eye on--

682
00:25:57.072 --> 00:25:59.939
MATT: Fair enough.
SAM: She's the splinter maker.

683
00:26:01.033 --> 00:26:03.520
MATT: As Jester and Yasha

684
00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:06.150
reach, both getting their fingers into the ground,

685
00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:08.840
and it's easy to get a grip because the soft earth

686
00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.740
gives way to your fingers as you push

687
00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:14.510
and find a heavy handhold on these deeply sunken roots.

688
00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:16.310
You both count to three and then lift (grunting)

689
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:18.620
at once and you hear (cracking)

690
00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:20.050
as it tears up out of the ground.

691
00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:22.150
Some of the roots splinter and break

692
00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:24.230
and some pull up right out of the soft earth

693
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:26.711
as you both lift and give it a shove and it

694
00:26:26.711 --> 00:26:29.070
(splashing)

695
00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:30.187
TRAVIS: Damn.

696
00:26:30.187 --> 00:26:32.010
MATT: It floats out over the water and sinks halfway

697
00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:35.400
before it finds enough soot and muck underneath

698
00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:39.096
to come to rest.
TRAVIS: ♪ She's a brick-- ♪

699
00:26:39.096 --> 00:26:40.081
TRAVIS and MARISHA: ♪ --house ♪

700
00:26:40.081 --> 00:26:41.280
MATT: The mist has come in quickly in this space,

701
00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:43.380
which, by the way, if you could, Caduceus,

702
00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:44.810
roll again because it would be disadvantage

703
00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:45.730
with the heavy mist around you.

704
00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:49.113
TALIESIN: Oh, that's fine.
LIAM: Salamanders and aphids go (fluttering).

705
00:26:49.113 --> 00:26:52.750
TALIESIN: That's even higher, so 20 is still the roll.

706
00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:54.180
MATT: The splash hits. You're about maybe--

707
00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:55.840
that took no time, you guys took maybe

708
00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:57.570
two minutes to get that thing out of the way.

709
00:26:57.570 --> 00:26:59.420
So you're still partially into this.

710
00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:02.200
Right as you guys are, you know,

711
00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:04.740
getting excited about that, you see something,

712
00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:05.731
a shape in the mist.

713
00:27:05.731 --> 00:27:07.630
LAURA: What does it look like? What's the shape look like?

714
00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:08.830
MATT: Looks like a--
TALIESIN: There.

715
00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:10.240
MATT: Kind of like a person.

716
00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.298
MARISHA: Is it a ghost?

717
00:27:11.298 --> 00:27:12.980
LAURA: Person, it looks like a person?
SAM: A person?

718
00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:15.020
LAURA: It looks just like a person?

719
00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:17.060
MATT: Then there's three more.

720
00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:18.235
MARISHA: Oh, it's a ghost.
ASHLEY: Floating?

721
00:27:18.235 --> 00:27:19.620
LAURA: How far away?

722
00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:21.350
MATT: They're just shapes in the
mist that you can barely make out.

723
00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:22.240
And you guys can't even see,

724
00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:24.410
you're the one who's pointing originally.

725
00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:26.150
Jester, you can just make it out a little bit.

726
00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:28.557
SAM: Cast faster, cast faster, cast faster.

727
00:27:28.557 --> 00:27:30.810
LIAM: (squawking)

728
00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:33.060
Six minutes, five minutes, I don't know.

729
00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:35.070
MATT: You see a shape come out of the water--

730
00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:36.340
ASHLEY: Oh!
MATT: Not too far

731
00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:39.230
from where you are, on the edge of where

732
00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:41.050
the trunk of the tree had hit the edge,

733
00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:43.470
you see a shape, a person rise up out of it.

734
00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:44.750
LAURA: Can we get their attention?

735
00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:47.300
MARISHA: Move closer and start prepping.

736
00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:49.390
Caduceus, tell us what these are.

737
00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:51.117
TALIESIN: Quickly checking, I'm checking,

738
00:27:51.117 --> 00:27:52.130
I'm doing the-- are they undead?

739
00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:54.510
I'm doing the--
MATT: You're doing which one?

740
00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:56.920
TALIESIN: The Eyes of the Grave.
MATT: Eyes of the Grave.

741
00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:00.070
What's the range on that?
TALIESIN: Range on that is 60 feet.

742
00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:03.250
I know the location of any undead within 60 feet that isn't

743
00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:05.700
behind total cover.
MATT: Okay, cool.

744
00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:07.770
You got about 15 that suddenly

745
00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:08.760
show up--
LAURA: And it's undead?

746
00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:10.210
MATT: -- immediately around you as undead.

747
00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:12.890
LAURA: I'm going to Turn Undead.
You going to do the same thing?

748
00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:14.360
TALIESIN: You first, or do you want to--?

749
00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:16.148
MATT: Well first, let's go ahead and roll initiative.

750
00:28:16.148 --> 00:28:18.138
(cheering)

751
00:28:18.138 --> 00:28:20.416
TRAVIS: Oh, I should've known.

752
00:28:20.416 --> 00:28:22.307
Not going to leave us high and dry.

753
00:28:22.307 --> 00:28:23.757
LAURA: No, we caught a bite.

754
00:28:23.757 --> 00:28:25.581
TRAVIS: My body's happy!

755
00:28:25.581 --> 00:28:28.273
MARISHA: Last week was just a sample fight.

756
00:28:28.273 --> 00:28:30.398
It barely counted.
MATT: You charged right into

757
00:28:30.398 --> 00:28:32.670
the depths of the swamp right as the night kicks in

758
00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:35.077

762
00:28:37.576 --> 00:28:38.790
What're we going to do, camp outside of her hut?

763
00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:40.765
ASHLEY: Yeah, we can't.

764
00:28:40.765 --> 00:28:42.326
It must be done.
LIAM: Here comes the mist.

765
00:28:42.326 --> 00:28:44.162
TRAVIS: Not a good initiative, not good at all.

835
00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:51.170
begin see these shapes move and shift,

836
00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:53.840
you see the one that comes out of the water nearby,

837
00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:57.200
right over on that side near Jester and Yasha,

838
00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:00.730
the trunk that has floated out in that direction,

839
00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:01.710
you see it rise up and go--

840
00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:03.060
LAURA: That's a scary one.
MATT: And you see

841
00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:06.020
they're humanoid, though largely their flesh is

842
00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:10.660
bloated and sloughing off their body in places,

843
00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:14.900
swollen and green, just this

844
00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:17.310
horrible toxic zombie-type persona

845
00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:19.430
and it looks like it will move really slow.

846
00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:22.159

LAURA: No!

00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:28.955
faster than any sort of zombie you've seen in your time.

00:31:34.088 --> 00:31:34.929
LIAM: I rolled shit.

853
00:31:34.929 --> 00:31:35.770
ASHLEY: I did, too.
LAURA: I rolled shit.

854
00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:37.311
MARISHA: I rolled average.
Matt: (cackling)

855
00:31:37.311 --> 00:31:38.350
LAURA: He's rolling really well.

856
00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:40.090
MATT: Natural 20.
TRAVIS: Oh!

857
00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:41.310
That's the opposite of what I rolled.

858
00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:43.480
MATT: All right, so 25 to 20?

859
00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:46.610
ASHLEY: 20.
LAURA: Oh shit!

860
00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:47.730
MATT: Yasha is going with them.

861
00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:50.540
LAURA: Yasha!
SAM: Ashley Johnson.

862
00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:52.742
ASHLEY: I'm doing slo-mo on the smoke.

863
00:31:52.742 --> 00:31:54.940
(laughter)

864
00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:56.015
MATT: All righty.

865
00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:58.141
20 to 15?

866
00:31:58.141 --> 00:31:59.041
MARISHA: 15.
TALIESIN: 16.

867
00:31:59.041 --> 00:31:59.964
SAM: 18.

868
00:31:59.964 --> 00:32:01.090
MATT: Oh, shit.
LAURA: I've got to write this stuff down.

869
00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:02.360
MATT: All right.
TRAVIS: Nott.

870
00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:05.740
MATT: Nott. You said 16-- oh, Caduceus got 16?

871
00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:07.220
Then Beau, all right.

872
00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:08.790
15 to 10?

873
00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:09.623
LIAM: 12.

874
00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:14.673
MATT: Ten to five?

875
00:32:14.673 --> 00:32:16.030
LAURA: Eight.

876
00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:18.155
SAM: Is this all the same day?
MATT: Yeah.

877
00:32:18.155 --> 00:32:19.530
SAM: Oh, I guess it won't affect us too much,

878
00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:21.130
but we're all exhausted, so--
MATT: Yes, you all have a point--

879
00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:23.500
well, most of you have a point of exhaustion.

880
00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:26.388
TRAVIS: I rolled a one.
MATT: All right, Fjord's up there.

881
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:28.263
Okay.
TRAVIS: I basically

882
00:32:28.263 --> 00:32:29.590
didn't even notice anything. (laughs)

883
00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:30.490
MATT: So--
TRAVIS: What're you guys

884
00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:31.580
getting all excited for?
MATT: Yasha,

885
00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:33.280
what's your dexterity?

886
00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:36.770
ASHLEY: My dexterity is 15.
MATT: I'll let you go first, then.

887
00:32:36.770 --> 00:32:37.810
SAM: Oh.
ASHLEY: Okay.

888
00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:40.773
LAURA: Ooh!
ASHLEY: Um, okay, so,

889
00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:45.330
who's nearest?
TRAVIS: Who's nearest?

890
00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:46.990
MATT: You have these two that are almost equidistant.

891
00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:48.390
This one is probably closest to you there.

892
00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:51.050
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to go over there.

893
00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:54.230
I would like to rage.
TRAVIS: (Grog voice) Yes, you would!

894
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:56.800
MATT: All righty, drawing which blade?

895
00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:59.770
LAURA: Your witch blade!
ASHLEY: My...

896
00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:03.300
Skingorger.
MATT: You got it.

897
00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:06.110
(whoosh) You charge through, sploosh, sploosh.

898
00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:09.660
Now, in this space, your movement is--

899
00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:11.400
LAURA: Halved. Of course.
MATT: --halved because you are in

900
00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:14.240
pretty heavy swamp around the space of where you guys

901
00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:16.580
are currently located.
ASHLEY: Okay.

902
00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:17.633
MATT: But you get there without an issue.

903
00:33:17.633 --> 00:33:18.700
You rush into the first one

904
00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:20.010
and it's there in front of you.

905
00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:22.980
Now, as opposed to just an undead

906
00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:24.520
and a zombie that's falling apart,

907
00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:25.960
and you've encountered a number of those in spaces,

908
00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:27.870
this reminds you of some of the zombies

909
00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:29.820
that you've seen in elements of Xhorhas

910
00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:34.010
that are usually curse-based husk zombies

911
00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:36.230
or they're created by nergaliids,

912
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:37.960
similar in ways to the ones that

913
00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:40.200
showed up at the carnival when you first--

914
00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.340
LAURA: Oh.
MATT: --met up with these people.

915
00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:45.532
They are faster, their fingers are bladed--

916
00:33:45.532 --> 00:33:46.365
LAURA: (gasps)

917
00:33:46.365 --> 00:33:48.020
MATT: --and they're, all around, a little more

918
00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:50.110
volatile than your standard lumbering undead.

919
00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:51.550
But nevertheless, in that moment

920
00:33:51.550 --> 00:33:53.110
of recognition, your blade is out.

921
00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:54.360
What are you doing?
ASHLEY: Okay.

922
00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:55.850
I'm going to attack.
MATT: All right.

923
00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:58.450
ASHLEY: Go for the head.
MARISHA: Yeah.

924
00:33:58.450 --> 00:33:59.283
ASHLEY: Yeah!

925
00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:03.950
That would be a 28 to hit.

926
00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:05.595
MATT: That'll hit.
ASHLEY: Okay.

927
00:34:05.595 --> 00:34:06.795
MARISHA: Because it's so rusted.

928
00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:09.285
That's what you have to be careful about.

929
00:34:09.285 --> 00:34:12.670
It's not the blade.
TRAVIS: That shot is a bitch, too.

930
00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:15.340
It hurts. It's like two days, you got to rub it.

931
00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:17.310
ASHLEY: I'm going to roll those again because of--

932
00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:22.567
yeah, I'm going to take that hit.

933
00:34:24.978 --> 00:34:28.200
12, 13... 23 for the first hit.

934
00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:29.730
MATT: 23 points of damage?
ASHLEY: Yep.

935
00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:30.590
MATT: Nice.

936
00:34:31.870 --> 00:34:33.770
You hack through, carving through,

937
00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:35.670
and you see its body open up a bit.

938
00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:39.230
As it does, as opposed to the black coagulated blood,

939
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:40.990
almost like moss pours out

940
00:34:40.990 --> 00:34:42.370
with the wound as it opens up.

941
00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:45.010
The arm splinters a bit but holds in place

942
00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:47.800
and then like (groans).
ASHLEY: Oh, that's gross.

943
00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:49.255
Okay, second hit.

944
00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:51.980
Oh, same, 28.
MATT: That'll do.

945
00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:54.122
Roll damage a second time.
ASHLEY: Okay.

946
00:34:59.246 --> 00:35:00.500
Going to roll again.

947
00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:02.088
Okay, same.

948
00:35:02.088 --> 00:35:04.671
(counting)

949
00:35:05.593 --> 00:35:06.442
(panting)

950
00:35:06.442 --> 00:35:07.858
12 points of damage.

951
00:35:07.858 --> 00:35:09.294
MATT: 12 points of damage.

952
00:35:09.294 --> 00:35:10.710
SAM: Nice!

953
00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:12.190
MATT: Second strike carves through

954
00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:14.860
and jams partway in its torso and gets stuck

955
00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:16.590
and the creature (gasps) bows for a second

956
00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:18.390
like it's about to collapse and then

957
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:20.490
(low gasp) back up at you with the blade

958
00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:22.560
still stuck in its torso.

959
00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:25.270
As you pull it back, it lurches forward towards you.

960
00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:26.710
Now, they're all going to go.

961
00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:28.010
SAM: Oh.
LIAM: Hey, Matt.

962
00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:30.120
Before you go forward, can we add my Resident Echo

963
00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:31.400
to the map?
MATT: Oh, good call,

964
00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:33.420
because you do still have him.
LAURA: How long does he last?

965
00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:34.504
MATT: Eight hours.
LAURA: Tight!

966
00:35:34.504 --> 00:35:35.802
MATT: Where would you like him to go?

967
00:35:35.802 --> 00:35:38.043
LIAM: I would've had him be a lookout,

968
00:35:38.043 --> 00:35:41.240
so I don't think he would be right with us.

969
00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:42.300
LIAM: Right there?
LIAM: Oh, there he is.

970
00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:44.363
It's the nega-Caleb.
MATT: Yep.

971
00:35:45.927 --> 00:35:48.870
LIAM: Could I put him standing under this tree?

972
00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:50.920
MATT: Sure.
LAURA: Because he doesn't have to

973
00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:53.780
worry about swampies.
MATT: You got it.

974
00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:56.220
Okay, cool.

975
00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:57.420
So now it's their turn.

976
00:35:59.948 --> 00:36:01.793
(whooshing)

977
00:36:01.793 --> 00:36:03.410
(squeaking)

978
00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:04.560
LAURA: Oh god, they're so fast.

979
00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:05.650
MATT: They are very fast.

980
00:36:05.650 --> 00:36:06.880
Even with their reduced movement,

981
00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:09.620
they are much quicker than any zombie you've encountered.

982
00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:11.780
Although, you've encountered these once a long time ago.

983
00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:13.600
TALIESIN: A long time ago.
MATT: These are--

984
00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:15.180
MARISHA: It's like when they remove frames

985
00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:16.640
in a horror film and they just--

986
00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:17.580
TRAVIS: Oh god.
MARISHA: You know?

987
00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:18.730
LAURA: Yeah.
(hissing)

988
00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:21.235
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
LAURA: Oh, I hate that shit.

989
00:36:21.235 --> 00:36:23.345
That's like, I have nightmares like that.

990
00:36:23.345 --> 00:36:26.350
ASHLEY: For clarification?
MATT: Yes?

991
00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:29.235
ASHLEY: I rolled savage attack on both of those,

992
00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:32.430
Savage Attacker, but the second,

993
00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:35.220
that second one that I rolled, I rolled the same

994
00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:38.037
both times. I just realized, I was like,

995
00:36:38.037 --> 00:36:39.608
"I think I can only use that once per turn."

996
00:36:39.608 --> 00:36:40.441
MATT: That's all good.
ASHLEY: Sorry.

997
00:36:40.441 --> 00:36:41.280
But thank you for being honest.

998
00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:44.030
ASHLEY: Just so later, people
aren't like, "You did it wrong."

999
00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:45.478
SAM: Oh, they'll still do that.

1000
00:36:45.478 --> 00:36:46.894
ASHLEY: I know I did.

1001
00:36:46.894 --> 00:36:48.477
LAURA: I know, I'm letting you know I know.

1002
00:36:48.477 --> 00:36:50.380
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm letting you know I know.

1003
00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:51.890
I realized.
LIAM: It's a side rule.

1004
00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:53.880
It's a Fred Savage attack, it's not the same thing.

1005
00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:56.888
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Fred Savage attack.
ASHLEY: Yep, yep.

1006
00:36:56.888 --> 00:36:59.100
MATT: The one that you've jammed the blade in

1007
00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:02.575
and it's nearly dead, it goes, (gasps) looks at you

1008
00:37:02.575 --> 00:37:05.805
and you watch as its chest pulses and inflates,

1009
00:37:05.805 --> 00:37:08.570
(explosion) it bursts into a spray of toxic,

1010
00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:09.964
visceral liquid--

1011
00:37:09.964 --> 00:37:11.080
SAM: Ugh.
MATT: Go ahead

1012
00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:12.180
and make a constitution saving throw--

1013
00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:14.162
LAURA: Oh my god.
ASHLEY: Sheesh.

1014
00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:16.493
ASHLEY: Constitution?
MATT: Yeah, constitution saving throw, please.

1015
00:37:16.493 --> 00:37:18.304
MARISHA: We've got poppers?
TRAVIS: That changes things.

1016
00:37:18.304 --> 00:37:19.820
ASHLEY: Ew.

1017
00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:21.911
ASHLEY: Seven, I mean ten.

1018
00:37:21.911 --> 00:37:25.161
MATT: Ten, that is still a failure, you

1019
00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:29.841
take 18 points of poison damage.

1020
00:37:29.841 --> 00:37:32.280
ASHLEY: Oh! Goodness!
TRAVIS: One eight?

1021
00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:33.113
MATT: Yes.

1022
00:37:33.113 --> 00:37:35.530
As it explodes, it is destroyed, but you are

1023
00:37:35.530 --> 00:37:37.820
coated in this horrible poisonous liquid

1024
00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:39.590
that like scars the flesh a bit

1025
00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:41.140
and it's all in your eyes and your mouth

1026
00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:43.354
and it burns and it's awful.

1027
00:37:43.354 --> 00:37:45.400
TRAVIS: Doesn't happen to hurt
the gentleman next to him, does it?

1028
00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:46.233
MATT: He doesn't seem affected by it.

1029
00:37:46.233 --> 00:37:47.550
He's going to attack you twice.

1030
00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:50.510
LAURA: Oh my god.

1031
00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:52.370
MATT: Oh, shit.
LAURA: No, don't--

1032
00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:54.580
MATT: Two 18s, literally, in a row.

1033
00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:56.410
ASHLEY: That hits.

1034
00:37:56.410 --> 00:37:59.180
MATT: Yeah, so that'll be a 23 each.

1035
00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:00.930
All right, you take--

1036
00:38:05.310 --> 00:38:06.810
TALIESIN: Turn Undead might be bad, then.

1037
00:38:06.810 --> 00:38:08.440
MATT: 17 points of bludgeoning damage.

1038
00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:12.210
You are raging, so that is halved to eight,

1039
00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:13.870
I believe, eight points of bludgeoning damage to you.

1040
00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:15.130
ASHLEY: 'Kay.

1041
00:38:15.130 --> 00:38:16.560
MATT: All right, that's two attacks on you,

1042
00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:18.510
Jester.
LAURA: Me?

1043
00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:20.290
MATT: That's four attacks on you from two of them.

1044
00:38:20.290 --> 00:38:21.880
LAURA: Little old me?
MATT: Yep!

1045
00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:22.713
There are two of them that are

1046
00:38:22.713 --> 00:38:24.566
currently rushed in towards you.

1047
00:38:24.566 --> 00:38:26.560
TALIESIN: -- for you, then.
LAURA: Okay.

1048
00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:29.830
MATT: All right, natural one misses, that's cocked.

1049
00:38:29.830 --> 00:38:31.850
They rolled really bad.

1050
00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:35.733
The highest one is a 15. What's your armor class?

1051
00:38:35.733 --> 00:38:36.566
LAURA: 18.
MATT: Yeah.

1052
00:38:36.566 --> 00:38:37.650
They just rush in and strike close with

1053
00:38:37.650 --> 00:38:39.570
their fingers are clawing and you're holding up your shield

1054
00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:41.360
and you're like one gets close to you

1055
00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:43.036
and you bash it away and it backs up again.

1056
00:38:43.036 --> 00:38:44.211
(growling)

1057
00:38:44.211 --> 00:38:47.500
They double back and go in for the assault a second time.

1058
00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:48.810
Caduceus, you have one that rushed up to you

1059
00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:52.360
and it's going to attack you twice.

1060
00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:53.660
Oh, twice in a row.

1061
00:38:54.690 --> 00:38:56.780
13 and a 13s.
TALIESIN: No, and I'm going to use

1062
00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:59.080
Shield of Retribution.
MATT: Okay, go for it.

1063
00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:00.472
TALIESIN: Misses with a melee attack.

1064
00:39:00.472 --> 00:39:02.320
I can just block them with arcane force.

1065
00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:04.530
They suffer 4d6 force damage

1066
00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:10.180
and they also have to move 20 feet away from me.

1067
00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:11.350
ASHLEY: Tight.

1068
00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:13.664
SAM: Shield of Retri-busch.
LAURA: Whoa.

1069
00:39:13.664 --> 00:39:18.110
Those dice are beautiful.
TALIESIN: 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

1070
00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:19.270
MATT: 19 points.
TALIESIN: 19 points

1071
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:20.920
of force damage and 20 feet back.

1072
00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:22.560
MATT: It runs towards you, leaps in the air,

1073
00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:24.130
and as it goes to strike with both claws,

1074
00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:26.120
you hold the shield up, take the blow,

1075
00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:28.699
and shove it off as a blast of energy (firing).

1076
00:39:28.699 --> 00:39:30.770
Fires it, throwing it back 20 feet.

1077
00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:32.792
It (crashing) lands and then,

1078
00:39:32.792 --> 00:39:35.630
(squelching) jumps up with an unexpected speed

1079
00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:37.770
and is getting ready to come back next round.

1080
00:39:37.770 --> 00:39:38.890
ASHLEY: Whoa!

1081
00:39:38.890 --> 00:39:41.350
MATT: These two are going to go after your echo, Caleb.

1082
00:39:41.350 --> 00:39:42.870
TRAVIS: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
MATT: It's four strikes

1083
00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:46.002
against it, the first two--
LIAM: He's a tank, he'll be fine.

1084
00:39:46.002 --> 00:39:47.450
(laughter)

1085
00:39:47.450 --> 00:39:48.680
MATT: 13 and a 14?

1086
00:39:49.830 --> 00:39:52.285
LIAM: No. No!

1087
00:39:52.285 --> 00:39:53.280
(laughter)

1088
00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:54.750
TRAVIS: They don't hit!
TALIESIN: Hey!

1089
00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:57.330
MATT: But it doesn't have Mage Armor on it.

1090
00:39:57.330 --> 00:39:58.659
LIAM: I don't have Mage Armor on.

1091
00:39:58.659 --> 00:40:00.340
I have elven chain and--
MATT: That's true.

1092
00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:02.860
Yeah, there you go, so both those miss.

1093
00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:04.476
LIAM: First time for everything.

1094
00:40:04.476 --> 00:40:05.570
(laughter)

1095
00:40:05.570 --> 00:40:07.014
TRAVIS: Whoosh, whoosh, really?

1096
00:40:07.014 --> 00:40:07.847
(laughter)

1097
00:40:07.847 --> 00:40:08.680
MATT: And two more strikes against you.

1098
00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:10.450
MATT: Just a mime going--

1099
00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:11.283
(laughter)

1100
00:40:11.283 --> 00:40:14.495
MATT: That's 21 and 21.
LIAM: Oh yeah, those hit.

1101
00:40:14.495 --> 00:40:15.930
(laughter)

1102
00:40:15.930 --> 00:40:16.763
He's gone.

1103
00:40:17.608 --> 00:40:18.610
SAM: Are those against your shadow or--

1104
00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:21.631
LIAM: He's a confetti filled balloon, guys.

1105
00:40:21.631 --> 00:40:22.964
(laughter)

1106
00:40:22.964 --> 00:40:25.564
MARISHA: He took them all.
MATT: 13 points of bludgeoning damage.

1107
00:40:26.931 --> 00:40:28.793
Oh. No, he's still up.

1108
00:40:28.793 --> 00:40:30.040
That's from both of them?

1109
00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:31.915
MATT: Yeah, one of them missed two
attacks, the other one hit twice but

1110
00:40:31.915 --> 00:40:34.198
didn't roll super high in the damage.
LIAM: Oh.

1111
00:40:34.198 --> 00:40:36.220
LAURA: Are you low on health already?

1112
00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:37.730
TRAVIS: No.
MARISHA: No, it's his echo.

1113
00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:40.420
It's his shadow.
LAURA: Oh!

1114
00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:43.663
LIAM: Yeah, it's-- I've never
used this spell, sorry.

1115
00:40:43.663 --> 00:40:44.683
MATT: It's all good.

1116
00:40:44.683 --> 00:40:46.480
That's going to be four attacks--
LIAM: It's still up!

1117
00:40:47.444 --> 00:40:48.277
MATT: There you go.

1118
00:40:48.277 --> 00:40:49.929
(laughter)
(clapping)

1119
00:40:49.929 --> 00:40:52.410
Congratulations!
TRAVIS: Take it, man.

1120
00:40:52.410 --> 00:40:55.000
MATT: That's four strikes against you, Fjord.

1121
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.013
TRAVIS: Yep.
MARISHA: Oh, shit.

1122
00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:59.574
MATT: Ooh.

1123
00:40:59.574 --> 00:41:01.142
TRAVIS: That's a good sound.

1124
00:41:01.142 --> 00:41:03.399
That's what you want to hear.
LAURA: Yeah.

1125
00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:07.310
MATT: A seven, an eleven,

1126
00:41:08.564 --> 00:41:09.940
a 17, and a 19.

1127
00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:11.450
TRAVIS: 17 and 19 hits, the last two don't.

1128
00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:12.760
MATT: Okay.

1129
00:41:14.427 --> 00:41:16.768
That is 14 points of
bludgeoning damage to you.

1130
00:41:16.768 --> 00:41:17.609
TRAVIS: Okay.

1131
00:41:17.609 --> 00:41:19.750
MATT: As both of them go
just raking towards you,

1132
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:22.970
bashing into you, trying
desperately to get through,

1133
00:41:22.970 --> 00:41:25.210
and then the other tries coming through

1134
00:41:25.210 --> 00:41:28.330
and they slash into your
torso and the side of your head

1135
00:41:28.330 --> 00:41:29.490
and you like (grunts) go forward.

1136
00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:31.210
You can feel the warmth as the blood

1137
00:41:31.210 --> 00:41:32.700
is pouring through the scalp already

1138
00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:34.670
from where it slashed
the back of your head.

1139
00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:37.730
That is going to finish that one there.

1140
00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:39.870
There is now one against you,
Caleb, with two strikes.

1141
00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:42.390
TRAVIS: The 14 points of damage were
the last two strikes combined?

1142
00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:43.223
MATT: Yes.
TRAVIS: Okay, gotcha.

1143
00:41:43.223 --> 00:41:44.890
Make sure we're not actually--

1144
00:41:44.890 --> 00:41:45.915
MATT: That's two strikes against you, Caleb,

1145
00:41:45.915 --> 00:41:48.200
from the one that managed to
squeeze through to get to you.

1146
00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:50.300
Ooh.

1147
00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:53.020
That is a 23 and a natural 20.

1148
00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:55.230
LIAM: Those both seem to
hit for some reason.

1149
00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:57.230
TALIESIN: Cancel the natural 20.
LIAM: Oh.

1150
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:58.063
SAM: Yes.

1151
00:41:58.063 --> 00:41:59.552
MATT: Did you use your
reaction to do your shield?

1152
00:41:59.552 --> 00:42:00.385
TALIESIN: Oh, I don't know if that--

1153
00:42:00.385 --> 00:42:02.380
I don't know if the shield
counts as a reaction, hold on.

1154
00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:04.707
MATT: Does it say under the--
TALIESIN: Yeah, it will say it.

1155
00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:07.601
Yeah, it's my reaction, fuck, sorry.

1156
00:42:07.601 --> 00:42:08.434
(groaning)

1157
00:42:08.434 --> 00:42:10.600
LIAM: Bring it on.
MATT: All right.

1158
00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:12.007
That is a--

1159
00:42:12.007 --> 00:42:14.457
LAURA: How many times a day do you get that?
TALIESIN: Once.

1160
00:42:14.457 --> 00:42:16.130
MATT: Seven points of
slashing damage to you, Caleb.

1161
00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:18.437
LIAM: Yeah, okay.
MATT: Then the crit.

1162
00:42:18.437 --> 00:42:20.410
TALIESIN: I don't think I did, it wasn't marked.

1163
00:42:20.410 --> 00:42:23.135
MATT: 10, 13 points of
slashing damage on that one.

1164
00:42:23.135 --> 00:42:25.317
LIAM: (high-pitched noise)

1165
00:42:25.317 --> 00:42:27.230
SAM: That's not bad.
MATT: Not too bad.

1166
00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:29.860
Two attacks against you, Beauregard.
MARISHA: Yeah.

1167
00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:31.760
MATT: This is the last of their run.

1168
00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:34.560
That is going to be a 13--
MARISHA: Miss.

1169
00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:36.518
MATT: And a 20.
MARISHA: 20 hits.

1170
00:42:36.518 --> 00:42:38.359
MATT: 20 hits, you take...

1171
00:42:39.452 --> 00:42:42.777
seven points of slashing damage.
MARISHA: Okay, that's fine.

1172
00:42:42.777 --> 00:42:45.260
MATT: That is the rest of their turn.

1173
00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:47.103
Next up comes Nott.
Nott, what're you doing?

1174
00:42:47.103 --> 00:42:48.989
SAM: That was a lot of attacks.
MATT: Yeah.

1175
00:42:48.989 --> 00:42:50.678
You go from just a couple
of shadows in the mist

1176
00:42:50.678 --> 00:42:53.799
to suddenly being swarmed
by this horrible-- (groaning)

1177
00:42:53.799 --> 00:42:55.900
LAURA: Instant chaos.
MATT: Sound of sucking,

1178
00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:59.020
terrible undead voices
and you're just swarmed.

1179
00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:01.290
You hear an explosion and
a scream off to the side,

1180
00:43:01.290 --> 00:43:03.990
your friends are being assailed
by them, what're you doing?

1181
00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:05.190
SAM: I feel like--
LAURA: Can I just--

1182
00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:07.520
there's one over here that we didn't move.
SAM: Oh, there is one over there.

1183
00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:09.997
MATT: Oh, thank you, thank you for that.

1184
00:43:09.997 --> 00:43:12.460
LIAM: (high-pitched voice) Kill, kill, kill.
TRAVIS: That's not an undead,

1185
00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:13.968
that's just an observer.

1186
00:43:13.968 --> 00:43:14.917
(laughter)

1187
00:43:14.917 --> 00:43:16.667
TALIESIN: "Hey, what're
y'all doing over-- oh."

1188
00:43:16.667 --> 00:43:18.608
MARISHA: The Gentleman? What are you doing here?

1189
00:43:18.608 --> 00:43:20.158
MATT: And actually, these guys couldn't
attack but they can still at least

1190
00:43:20.158 --> 00:43:22.069
get up in the mix. Which
they would anyway with

1191
00:43:22.069 --> 00:43:23.660
their dash action, so there we go.

1192
00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:25.685
LIAM: Jeepers.
MATT: Actually, this one would probably

1193
00:43:25.685 --> 00:43:27.480
get behind Ashley there, so we'll go with that.

1194
00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:28.860
MARISHA: Jinkies.
MATT: Mmkay.

1195
00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:30.910
So, what're you doing, Nott?

1196
00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:32.130
SAM: She's right next to me, huh?

1197
00:43:32.130 --> 00:43:33.332
LAURA: I'm sorry, I fucked that up for you.

1198
00:43:33.332 --> 00:43:35.040
SAM: No, that's fine, it's fine.

1199
00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:37.860
I feel like Yasha's okay, I feel like

1200
00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:40.550
Jester's going to do some magic shit.

1201
00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:45.070
Fjord I don't really care
about. Beau-- Beau's fine.

1202
00:43:45.070 --> 00:43:47.070
MARISHA: I'll be fine.
SAM: I got to protect Caleb.

1203
00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:49.740
I will shoot the one engaged with Caleb.

1204
00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:50.860
MATT: Right here?
SAM: Yes.

1205
00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:52.710
MATT: Go for it. Roll for an attack.

1206
00:43:53.843 --> 00:43:55.327
SAM: Four. (laughs)

1207
00:43:55.327 --> 00:43:57.602
Plus 10! So 14.

1208
00:43:57.602 --> 00:43:58.850
MATT: That hits.
SAM: Hey!

1209
00:43:58.850 --> 00:44:00.930
MATT: They are very easy to hit.

1210
00:44:00.930 --> 00:44:04.330
They don't try and dodge,
they don't have any armor.

1211
00:44:04.330 --> 00:44:05.870
LAURA: Whoa, that was a good roll.

1212
00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:08.370
SAM: Yes it was. 20...

1213
00:44:08.370 --> 00:44:09.840
32 plus 6,

1214
00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:13.530
38, 38 points of damage.

1215
00:44:13.530 --> 00:44:15.643
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: 38 points of damage.

1216
00:44:15.643 --> 00:44:17.059
(chuckles)

1217
00:44:17.059 --> 00:44:18.942
It is done.

1218
00:44:18.942 --> 00:44:21.520
SAM: Ooh! Does it explode or is it okay?

1219
00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:22.972
MATT: As you strike it

1220
00:44:22.972 --> 00:44:25.200
in the back of its head, it

1221
00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:26.530
falls forward onto its knees

1222
00:44:26.530 --> 00:44:28.825
and then its body (squelching)--

1223
00:44:28.825 --> 00:44:30.213
(groaning)

1224
00:44:30.213 --> 00:44:32.788
MATT: Bursts. I need Beauregard, Caleb, and Fjord

1225
00:44:32.788 --> 00:44:35.772
to all make constitution saving throws, please.

1226
00:44:38.757 --> 00:44:41.297
MARISHA: No, it's going to happen.
LIAM: ♪ This is how we do it ♪

1227
00:44:41.297 --> 00:44:42.622
MARISHA: It's okay.

1228
00:44:42.622 --> 00:44:43.697
TRAVIS: 24.

1229
00:44:43.697 --> 00:44:45.800
MATT: 24, success, you take 12
points of poison damage.

1230
00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:47.280
TRAVIS: Oof.
MARISHA: 20.

1231
00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:49.240
MATT: 12 points of poison damage.

1232
00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:50.195
Caleb?

1233

LIAM: (mumbling)

1234
00:44:53.527 --> 00:44:55.960
TALIESIN: I got some distance.
MARISHA: I'm-- does my--

1235

LIAM: 18.
MATT: 18. 12 points of poison damage.

1236
00:44:58.084 --> 00:45:00.817
MARISHA: Does my immunity to poison change anything?
MATT: Huh?

1237
00:45:00.817 --> 00:45:02.825
MARISHA: My immunity to poison change anything or--

1238
00:45:02.825 --> 00:45:05.690
MATT: Immune to the condition
or is it-- this is your--

1239
00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:08.781
LIAM: Monk shit.
MARISHA: My monk shit.

1240
00:45:08.781 --> 00:45:12.390
MATT: I'll double check here but I'm
pretty sure-- this might do nothing to you.

1241
00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:15.280
I'm just going to double check real fast here with your--

1242
00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:16.930
SAM: Monks have a lot of shit.

1243
00:45:16.930 --> 00:45:18.988
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: Yeah, monks are pretty great.

1244
00:45:18.988 --> 00:45:19.830
MARISHA: They're awesome.

1245
00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:21.750
MATT: Immune to disease and poison.

1246
00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:23.090
Yeah, nothing.

1247
00:45:23.090 --> 00:45:24.313
It hits you and you just--

1248
00:45:24.313 --> 00:45:25.480
(splashing) (clicks tongue)

1249
00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:26.690
LIAM: Glisten.
MATT: Nothing.

1250
00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:28.850
TRAVIS: Your friends are dying.
MARISHA: Ooh, look at my guns.

1251
00:45:28.850 --> 00:45:30.708
They look good now.

1252
00:45:30.708 --> 00:45:31.740
(laughter)

1253
00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:34.975
TALIESIN: Huh, interesting.
LIAM: You are as thin as Gandhi.

1254
00:45:34.975 --> 00:45:36.730
MARISHA: Fuck you.
SAM: And then I will--

1255
00:45:36.730 --> 00:45:40.120
that one's within melee of
me, so I will disengage--

1256
00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:40.953
MATT: All righty.

1257
00:45:40.953 --> 00:45:44.011
SAM: Oh boy, there's nowhere to run,
we're surrounded, but I'll-- I'll--

1258
00:45:45.354 --> 00:45:46.595
I'll just run away.

1259
00:45:46.595 --> 00:45:50.800
MATT: Okay, your movement is 35?
SAM: Yeah.

1260
00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:52.140
Yeah, I'll run back that way, yeah.

1261
00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:54.997
MATT: 20, 25, 30, that's about
as far as you can get.

1262
00:45:54.997 --> 00:45:56.863
SAM: That seems good.

1263
00:45:56.863 --> 00:45:58.347
MATT: Actually no, you were on the point there,

1264
00:45:58.347 --> 00:46:00.010
so you can actually get a little further if you want to,

1265
00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:02.020
over this way, just because you were on the--

1266
00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:02.853
SAM: Yeah, it's all good.

1267
00:46:02.853 --> 00:46:03.860
MATT: You were on the section
that didn't have any swamp

1268
00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:04.693
and then you moved into the swamp.

1269
00:46:04.693 --> 00:46:06.240
SAM: There's a guy over there,
I didn't see him.

1270
00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:07.883
MATT: Well you do now.
SAM: Oh, shit!

1271
00:46:07.883 --> 00:46:09.650
(laughter)

1272
00:46:09.650 --> 00:46:10.510
Okay, that's it.
MATT: All right.

1273
00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:12.133
Caduceus, you're up, Beau, you're on deck.

1274
00:46:12.133 --> 00:46:14.450
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Bless at fourth level.

1275
00:46:14.450 --> 00:46:17.310
MATT: Ooh!
TALIESIN: On everyone but Beau.

1276
00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:18.582
MATT: Damn, boy.

1277
00:46:18.582 --> 00:46:19.910
TRAVIS: (laughs)

1278
00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:22.498
TALIESIN: Everyone gets an extra
d4 to attacks and saves.

1279
00:46:22.498 --> 00:46:25.206
MARISHA: I'm flattered that everyone--
LIAM: It's confidence.

1280
00:46:25.206 --> 00:46:27.310
MARISHA: Has-- yeah, that much confidence in me.

1281
00:46:27.310 --> 00:46:29.030
TALIESIN: So yeah, if you have to roll a save

1282
00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:31.450
or if you roll an attack,
you can add a d4 to it.

1283
00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:34.557
SAM: #blessed.

1284
00:46:36.373 --> 00:46:37.860
On me as well, or--

1285
00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:39.020
TALIESIN: Yep.
SAM: Oh okay, cool.

1286
00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:41.350
TALIESIN: Everyone's got a d--
LAURA: Wait, on me as well?

1287
00:46:41.350 --> 00:46:42.183
TALIESIN: On you as well.

1288
00:46:42.183 --> 00:46:43.833
SAM and LIAM: "On little ol' me?"

1289
00:46:43.833 --> 00:46:46.890
TALIESIN: Even-- yeah, everybody.

1290
00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:48.180
MATT: All righty, that's your action.

1291
00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:49.780
TALIESIN: That's my action, I'm like-- this is

1292
00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:51.290
where I am right now, oh boy.

1293
00:46:51.290 --> 00:46:53.560
Am I not engaged with any of them?

1294
00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:55.680
MATT: You were and then you blasted
them back with your shield,

1295
00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:58.100
so you are not currently engaged
with anything in combat.

1296
00:46:58.100 --> 00:47:01.370
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to
break off from the group a bit.

1297
00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:02.303
MATT: Okay.

1298
00:47:02.303 --> 00:47:06.025
TALIESIN: Because I have just figured
out that this grouping is a disaster.

1299
00:47:06.025 --> 00:47:07.125
TRAVIS: (laughs)

1300
00:47:07.125 --> 00:47:08.910
TALIESIN: And I'm going to try
and get to the other side

1301
00:47:08.910 --> 00:47:11.557
of this trunk over here,
if that's okay.

1302
00:47:11.557 --> 00:47:14.320
MATT: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30,
that's as far as you--

1303
00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:15.820
TALIESIN: On the other side of it, if possible.

1304
00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:18.330
LAURA: How long does Bless last?
TALIESIN: Until I lose concentration.

1305
00:47:18.330 --> 00:47:20.750
MATT: I'd say because you were in there,
I'll give you another block,

1306
00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:23.055
but that's as far as you can get.

1307
00:47:23.055 --> 00:47:23.888
Oh, the other side?

1308
00:47:23.888 --> 00:47:24.913
TALIESIN: Oh, there's no way to
get through there, yeah.

1309
00:47:24.913 --> 00:47:27.238
MATT: That's also rough terrain
because it's a bunch of bunching,

1310
00:47:27.238 --> 00:47:28.987
so I can get you about there.
TALIESIN: I'm getting in there--

1311
00:47:28.987 --> 00:47:32.062
MATT: And you are partially
enveloped by a bush.

1312
00:47:32.062 --> 00:47:33.203
(laughing)

1313
00:47:33.203 --> 00:47:34.661
MATT: There you go.
You're good, you're good.

1314
00:47:34.661 --> 00:47:36.061
TALIESIN: There we go.
MATT: Or there, too.

1315
00:47:36.061 --> 00:47:37.975
That works fine, sure, wherever
you want to go, Caduceus.

1316
00:47:37.975 --> 00:47:39.970
TALIESIN: That's where-- I'm
trying to back up against that.

1317
00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:41.853
MATT: All right.
TALIESIN: There we go, if that's real stuff.

1318
00:47:41.853 --> 00:47:43.990
MATT: There you go.
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

1319
00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:46.720
Yeah, that's-- I don't think I have
a bonus action so yeah, that's--

1320
00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:48.727
MATT: Beauregard, you're up.
MARISHA: All right.

1321
00:47:48.727 --> 00:47:52.600
MATT: Caleb, you're on deck.
MARISHA: I have zombie Jesus here.

1322
00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:54.260
Zombie Jesus?
MATT: (chuckles) Sure.

1323
00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:56.100
MARISHA: And then that guy?
MATT: Yes.

1324
00:47:56.100 --> 00:48:00.590
MARISHA: I'm going to
elbow the guy behind me

1325
00:48:00.590 --> 00:48:04.531
and then give a nice roundhouse
to the guy up front, I don't know.

1326
00:48:04.531 --> 00:48:06.031
MATT: Go for it. So one attack to each?

1327
00:48:06.031 --> 00:48:08.670
MARISHA: One to each.
MATT: You got it.

1328
00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:10.075
MARISHA: Wow, wow, that's real bad.

1329
00:48:10.075 --> 00:48:12.633
LIAM: Bad rolls.
MARISHA: Real bad. 13 and a 15.

1330
00:48:12.633 --> 00:48:15.720
MATT: Both hit.
MARISHA: Wow!

1331
00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:18.240
Anyone can hit these guys.
SAM: Yeah.

1332
00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:19.725
LAURA: What'd you roll?
MARISHA: Awesome!

1333
00:48:19.725 --> 00:48:22.198
MARISHA: I rolled a three and a five
and I still hit both of them.

1334
00:48:22.198 --> 00:48:24.010
LAURA: Wow.
ASHLEY: What was the total?

1335
00:48:24.010 --> 00:48:26.536
MARISHA: Pop pop. 13 and 15.
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.

1336
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.558
MARISHA: That's going to be
eight to the guy in the back--

1337
00:48:31.558 --> 00:48:33.608
MATT: All righty.
MARISHA: 10 to the guy in the front.

1338
00:48:33.608 --> 00:48:36.241
LIAM: (along with background music)
♪ Bum bum ba dip a dup ah ♪

1339
00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:40.520
MARISHA: Still standing?

1340
00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:44.370
MATT: What was the second damage? It was--
MARISHA: Ten. Eight and ten.

1341
00:48:44.370 --> 00:48:45.740
MATT: Yeah, those still standing, no issue.

1342
00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:48.244
They both take hits, and they're like-- (growls)

1343
00:48:48.244 --> 00:48:50.450
It doesn't seem to be that much of an impact on them.

1344
00:48:50.450 --> 00:48:52.007
TALIESIN: Oh, no I've got a bunch of--

1345
00:48:52.007 --> 00:48:54.003
MATT: (sneezes) Pardon me.
MARISHA: Bless you.

1346
00:48:54.003 --> 00:48:56.169
MATT: (sneezes)
LAURA: Bless you!

1347
00:48:56.169 --> 00:48:57.326
MATT: (sneezes)

1348
00:48:57.326 --> 00:48:58.829
(cheering)

1349
00:48:58.829 --> 00:49:01.262
SAM: A triple sneezer?
MATT: They're usually triple sneezes.

1350
00:49:01.262 --> 00:49:02.160
MARISHA: So wait, my--

1351
00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:04.427
TRAVIS: Got a triple sneeze.
MARISHA: What doesn't seem to-- okay.

1352
00:49:04.427 --> 00:49:06.093
(laughter)

1353
00:49:06.093 --> 00:49:06.926
ASHLEY: Lucky.

1354
00:49:06.926 --> 00:49:08.100
(laughter)

1355
00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:10.640
LAURA: Why don't you brag about it?

1356
00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:13.532
MARISHA: Flurry of Blows.
MATT: Flurry of Blows? All right.

1357
00:49:13.532 --> 00:49:16.032
MARISHA: Same thing, one each.
MATT: Pop pop, you got it.

1358
00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:20.288
MARISHA: Both hit with a 15 and a 17?
MATT: Yep.

1359
00:49:20.288 --> 00:49:21.970
MARISHA: Oh, those are better.

1360
00:49:21.970 --> 00:49:24.230
18 to the guy in the back.
MATT: Nice.

1361
00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:28.280
MARISHA: And-- nope, sorry,
sorry, let me rethink that.

1362
00:49:29.410 --> 00:49:32.500
14 to the guy in the back.
MATT: 14 to the guy in the back.

1363
00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:34.140
MARISHA: That's eight plus six, right?

1364
00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:36.298
SAM: Correct.
MARISHA: Yes. And then--

1365
00:49:36.298 --> 00:49:39.406
SAM: To zombie Jesus?
MARISHA: To zombie Jesus, and then...

1366
00:49:41.081 --> 00:49:43.720
12 to the guy in the front.
MATT: All righty.

1367
00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:45.910
Crack crack, you hit them both again.

1368
00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:47.700
They both-- (grunt) bow back

1369
00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:49.590
and they're looking hurt but they're

1370
00:49:49.590 --> 00:49:52.010
still standing angrily,
growling, on each side of you.

1371
00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:54.350
You do, however, get your
Extract Aspects on them.

1372
00:49:54.350 --> 00:49:58.060
They are, surprisingly, immune
to poison and being poisoned.

1373
00:49:58.060 --> 00:49:59.167
SAM: Makes sense.

1374
00:49:59.167 --> 00:50:00.909
MARISHA: That's not surprising.
MATT: I know.

1375
00:50:00.909 --> 00:50:03.859
MARISHA: They're immune to the
shit that they throw on us.

1376
00:50:03.859 --> 00:50:06.200
"They're immune to poison," I say to everybody.

1377
00:50:07.142 --> 00:50:09.240
LAURA: Tell me what to do, Sam.
MARISHA: All right, that's my turn.

1378
00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:11.431
MATT: You got it, Beau. Caleb, you're up.
Jester, you're on deck.

1379
00:50:11.431 --> 00:50:16.431
LIAM: So the nega-Widogast pulls his
hands apart and a giant fireball

1380
00:50:16.435 --> 00:50:19.635
opens up in his hands and
he chucks it...

1381
00:50:19.635 --> 00:50:21.559
over to here.

1382
00:50:21.559 --> 00:50:22.976
MATT: All righty.

1383
00:50:24.175 --> 00:50:26.110
LIAM: Over in this direction
so that we can hopefully

1384
00:50:26.110 --> 00:50:29.645
catch himself and these two
buddies and this one here.

1385
00:50:29.645 --> 00:50:30.970
MATT: Yeah, you can get all three of those.

1386
00:50:30.970 --> 00:50:32.167
LIAM: And himself.
MATT: And himself!

1387
00:50:32.167 --> 00:50:34.020
LIAM: He will disappear.
SAM: It's a fireball?

1388
00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:35.850
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage on that.

1389
00:50:35.850 --> 00:50:37.820
LIAM: Now, where's that thing, where did it go?

1390
00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:39.200
There it is.

1391
00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:41.216
MATT: Okay, that's a fail.

1392
00:50:41.216 --> 00:50:44.410
LIAM: I am Werner Herzog and you are listening

1393
00:50:44.410 --> 00:50:46.010
to Critical Role.

1394
00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:48.340
That, I got to re-roll
it because it was--

1395
00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:50.507
these dice, I can't do it.

1396
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:56.750
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

1397
00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:57.601
Here we go.

1398
00:50:59.510 --> 00:51:00.981
11, 13,

1399
00:51:00.981 --> 00:51:02.700
17, 21,

1400
00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:03.640
27,

1401
00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:04.580
33,

1402
00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:07.580
34.

1403
00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:11.600
Plus the-- plus the-- plus the-- plus the--

1404
00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:13.138
TRAVIS: Just shift your position.

1405
00:51:13.138 --> 00:51:14.288
LIAM: Plus the,

1406
00:51:14.288 --> 00:51:17.270
ASHLEY: (laughs)

1407
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:19.370
LIAM: 34.
MATT: 34 points of damage?

1408
00:51:19.370 --> 00:51:20.703
LIAM: Yeah, high rolls.

1409
00:51:20.703 --> 00:51:23.460
MATT: That's actually really good.

1410
00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:24.902
The two, so yeah.

1411
00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:28.790
Caleb-- the echo Caleb-- releases it

1412
00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:31.830
and scatters into shadow and is gone

1413
00:51:31.830 --> 00:51:33.970
as the flaming blast lights up the space around you

1414
00:51:33.970 --> 00:51:34.870
in the middle of this dark

1415
00:51:34.870 --> 00:51:37.170
barely moonlit center of the swamp.

1416
00:51:37.170 --> 00:51:39.640
As the zombies take the flame

1417
00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:40.770
and scramble for a minute,

1418
00:51:40.770 --> 00:51:42.830
caught off guard by the blast,

1419
00:51:42.830 --> 00:51:44.980
they all get back to their place.

1420
00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:46.960
This one here looks hurt,

1421
00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:49.378
the other two are almost destroyed.

1422
00:51:49.378 --> 00:51:51.890
Whatever flesh that was soggy and green

1423
00:51:51.890 --> 00:51:54.520
is now black and crispy, they've lost most of

1424
00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:55.829
their facial features and they're just like

1425
00:51:55.829 --> 00:51:57.980
(gasping) but they're still standing.

1426
00:51:57.980 --> 00:52:00.820
LIAM: And also, Caleb turns into a giant ape.

1427
00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:02.140
MATT: Oh, okay, that works, too.

1428
00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:03.307
SAM: Oh, okay.

1429
00:52:04.943 --> 00:52:06.493
TRAVIS: Turn into what, a giant ape?
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

1430
00:52:06.493 --> 00:52:07.976
TRAVIS: Woo!
TALIESIN: We're monkeying around.

1431
00:52:11.330 --> 00:52:12.340
MATT: All right.

1432
00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:15.272
So with that, you are now a blessed monkey.

1433
00:52:16.610 --> 00:52:18.020
TRAVIS: #Blessed.
MATT: Yes.

1434
00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:21.520
MATT: And you get shunted out to this space

1435
00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:22.730
since you cannot occupy the space

1436
00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:23.920
the rest of your group is there.

1437
00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:25.910
And you're a giant monkey, that's your action.

1438
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:26.743
All righty.

1439
00:52:27.852 --> 00:52:29.307
Is that your turn, are you going to stay there?

1440
00:52:29.307 --> 00:52:30.220
LIAM: (affirmative grunt)

1441
00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:31.350
MATT: (chuckles) You got it.

1442
00:52:31.350 --> 00:52:32.500
Jester, you're up. Fjord, you're on deck.

1443
00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:33.410
LAURA: Okay.

1444
00:52:34.270 --> 00:52:36.800
I am going to--
SAM: This is it.

1445
00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:37.633
LAURA: I know.

1446
00:52:37.633 --> 00:52:38.580
I'm going to reach into my bag

1447
00:52:38.580 --> 00:52:42.030
and pull out the diamond that Caleb gave me

1448
00:52:42.030 --> 00:52:45.380
that I used to Incite Greed and I'm going to hold it

1449
00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:49.580
high in the air and I'm going to cast Incite Greed.

1450
00:52:49.580 --> 00:52:51.250
MATT: Okay.
SAM: Incite Greed.

1451
00:52:51.250 --> 00:52:54.650
LAURA: Any creature that I choose within 30 feet of me,

1452
00:52:54.650 --> 00:52:56.460
which should be all of them except for that skeleton

1453
00:52:56.460 --> 00:52:59.280
and this guy over here, has to make a

1454
00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:00.713
wisdom saving throw.

1455
00:53:00.713 --> 00:53:01.546
MATT: Correct.

1456
00:53:02.530 --> 00:53:05.330
Those two on the outside are exempt.

1457
00:53:05.330 --> 00:53:07.613
That guy there--

1458
00:53:07.613 --> 00:53:08.960
Failure.

1459
00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:10.150
Two next to Fjord--

1460
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:13.580
16.
LAURA: Fail.

1461
00:53:13.580 --> 00:53:14.413
MATT: Fail.

1462
00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:18.665
17.
LAURA: Fail. Ah, 17 he needs, 17.

1463
00:53:18.665 --> 00:53:19.650
MATT: This guy does succeed.

1464
00:53:19.650 --> 00:53:20.720
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: There's nothing.

1465
00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:22.280
He's fine on that.

1466
00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:24.115
The one next to Beau--

1467
00:53:24.115 --> 00:53:25.380
Fail.

1468
00:53:25.380 --> 00:53:28.553
The two next to Yasha, fail.

1469
00:53:28.553 --> 00:53:29.740
Fa-- no, he succeeds.

1470
00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:31.170
He rolled an 18.
LAURA: Okay.

1471
00:53:32.050 --> 00:53:33.190
MATT: They have a penalty, though,

1472
00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:34.620
but they're still rolling pretty high.

1473
00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:37.530
This guy, this guy, and those two are unaffected.

1474
00:53:37.530 --> 00:53:39.984
The two that are next to you, Jester.

1475
00:53:39.984 --> 00:53:42.300
Fail and fail.

1476
00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:44.030
SAM: What?
TRAVIS: What happens?

1477
00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:47.360
LAURA: They have to use their entire turn

1478
00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:49.870
to do nothing but move towards me.

1479
00:53:49.870 --> 00:53:51.300
If they are within five feet of me,

1480
00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:53.110
it can't do anything but stare greedily

1481
00:53:53.110 --> 00:53:54.400
at the gem that I'm holding up.

1482
00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:56.100
SAM: Whoa!
LAURA: They all want this gem

1483
00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:58.000
very badly.
MATT: And that's concentration?

1484
00:53:59.396 --> 00:54:00.379
LAURA: It is.

1485
00:54:01.279 --> 00:54:02.112
MATT: All righty.

1486
00:54:03.325 --> 00:54:07.020
LAURA: And at the end of their turn, they get to make

1487
00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:08.820
a wisdom save again.
MATT: You got it.

1488
00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:09.830
Okay, good to know, Jester.

1489
00:54:09.830 --> 00:54:10.780
SAM: Wow.
MATT: Thank you.

1490
00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:12.080
Fjord, you're up.

1491
00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:13.338
TRAVIS: That's, that's amazing.

1492
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:16.810
LAURA: If you guys hurt them, it ends the charm effect;

1493
00:54:16.810 --> 00:54:18.460
it's like a charm, so only attack

1494
00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:19.880
the ones that aren't charmed right now.

1495
00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:21.480
TRAVIS: Got it.
SAM: Wow.

1496
00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:25.130
TRAVIS: Can I use my bonus action to put my Hexblade's Curse

1497
00:54:25.130 --> 00:54:28.330
on this individual over here that has

1498
00:54:28.330 --> 00:54:31.781
the very large-- that, yes.
MATT: You got it.

1499
00:54:31.781 --> 00:54:34.470
TRAVIS: And I will take two swings with

1500
00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:37.270
the Star Razor at that unaffected--

1501
00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:39.540
MATT: Right there?
TRAVIS: -- gentleman, yes.

1502
00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:41.211
MATT: Go for it.

1503
00:54:41.211 --> 00:54:42.619
Two strikes at that one?
TRAVIS: Yes.

1504
00:54:42.619 --> 00:54:43.452
MATT: All righty.

1505
00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:48.440
TRAVIS: And I'll use the word to make it glow.

1506
00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:50.840
MATT: So the runes light up, the blade gives off

1507
00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:53.560
this bright, radiant light

1508
00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:56.450
that emanates from the edge and you swing.

1509
00:54:56.450 --> 00:54:58.220
TRAVIS: 27.
MATT: That hits.

1510
00:54:58.220 --> 00:55:00.290
TRAVIS: Second one is--
SAM: Woo, c'mon Fjordy.

1511
00:55:00.290 --> 00:55:02.270
TRAVIS: Wow. 28 to hit.

1512
00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:04.716
MATT: Both hit. Go and roll damage on that one.

1513
00:55:04.716 --> 00:55:09.046
TRAVIS: Good, I didn't even
roll the fucking plus-- whatever.

1514
00:55:09.046 --> 00:55:11.213
10. Been a minute.

1515
00:55:13.478 --> 00:55:17.240
11 points of damage and 19.

1516
00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:21.410
So, 29 points of slashing damage.

1517
00:55:21.410 --> 00:55:22.960
MATT: 29 to the one that was unwounded

1518
00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:25.464
right there.
TRAVIS: Yes, unaffected.

1519
00:55:25.464 --> 00:55:27.700
MATT: (slashing) Both strikes carve through.

1520
00:55:27.700 --> 00:55:30.070
Where the blade carves into its flesh, it opens up

1521
00:55:30.070 --> 00:55:32.410
and you can see the radiant energy sears through.

1522
00:55:32.410 --> 00:55:35.530
There's no roughness to it, it just

1523
00:55:35.530 --> 00:55:37.470
burns straight through, like

1524
00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:40.551
an incise laser had carved.

1525
00:55:40.551 --> 00:55:42.400
SAM: Nice.
MATT: It's still standing,

1526
00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:45.150
though really, really badly hurt and barely holding on.

1527
00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:48.930
That's your action and your bonus.

1528
00:55:48.930 --> 00:55:50.970
TRAVIS: And my bonus was the Hexblade's Curse.

1529
00:55:50.970 --> 00:55:52.300
MATT: You going to move or stay put?

1530
00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:53.220
TRAVIS: Yes, I stay put.
MATT: All right.

1531
00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:55.137
Top of the round. Yasha, you're up next.
ASHLEY: Okay.

1532
00:55:55.137 --> 00:55:56.820
MATT: You are currently surrounded,

1533
00:55:56.820 --> 00:55:58.970
though one of them who's behind you,

1534
00:55:58.970 --> 00:56:02.128
went from (growling) to--

1535
00:56:02.128 --> 00:56:03.690
and just staring over towards Jester,

1536
00:56:03.690 --> 00:56:04.880
while the one that's immediately in front of you

1537
00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:06.060
is still thrashing towards you.

1538
00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:07.370
ASHLEY: Okay, since he's distracted,

1539
00:56:07.370 --> 00:56:08.702
I'm going to go for the one in front of me.
LAURA: ♪ Come to me ♪

ASHLEY: Okay.

00:56:15.411 --> 00:56:17.702
MARISHA: Butterflies.

1544
00:56:17.702 --> 00:56:20.080
ASHLEY: First hit, I'll take that.

1545
00:56:21.650 --> 00:56:22.660
(counting)

1546
00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:24.260
21.

ASHLEY: 21 points of damage.

MARISHA: Oh look, a deer.

MATT: Second strike.
ASHLEY: Second hit.

1550
00:56:29.555 --> 00:56:30.800
(sighs) It's going to explode on me.

1551
00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:33.090
SAM: Zombie deer.
MARISHA: A zombie deer.

1552
00:56:33.090 --> 00:56:34.840
TRAVIS: The deer's like (snarling).
ASHLEY: 12.

1553
00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:36.087
MATT: Also hits.
ASHLEY: It does?

1554
00:56:36.087 --> 00:56:38.463
LAURA: What?! 12 still hits?
ASHLEY: Yeah!

1555
00:56:38.463 --> 00:56:40.690
MATT: They don't have a great armor class.
SAM: These guys suck.

1556
00:56:40.690 --> 00:56:41.840
ASHLEY: Okay.
TRAVIS: Shut up!

1557
00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:43.830
ASHLEY: I'm going to try rolling this again since I didn't

1558
00:56:43.830 --> 00:56:45.870
on the last one.
MATT: Go for it.

1559
00:56:45.870 --> 00:56:48.663
ASHLEY: That's same, okay, so five--

1560
00:56:50.930 --> 00:56:53.100
12 points of damage.
MATT: 12 points of damage.

1561
00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:55.110
All right, you attack twice, as it (slicing)

1562
00:56:55.110 --> 00:56:56.410
and then (grunts) carve upward

1563
00:56:56.410 --> 00:56:58.520
and you actually carve through the face

1564
00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:00.265
and the head splits a bit

1565
00:57:00.265 --> 00:57:02.210
but one of the eyes looks back to you

1566
00:57:02.210 --> 00:57:04.230
and it's shambling towards you,

1567
00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:06.380
like the second T2 reference,

1568
00:57:06.380 --> 00:57:09.236
like the T-1000 split open coming in your direction.

1569
00:57:09.236 --> 00:57:10.569
LAURA: Oh, yes.

1570
00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:13.750
MATT: You still have your bonus and your movement

1571
00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:15.693
if you want to do anything or are you going to stay put?

1572
00:57:15.693 --> 00:57:17.220
TRAVIS: (groaning)

1573
00:57:17.220 --> 00:57:18.780
ASHLEY: Okay.

1574
00:57:19.836 --> 00:57:21.776
(inhales)

1575
00:57:21.776 --> 00:57:23.920
Oh, you know what I'm going to do?

1576
00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:25.470
MATT: Whatcha going to do?

1577
00:57:25.470 --> 00:57:27.110
ASHLEY: Is--

1578
00:57:27.110 --> 00:57:29.081
TRAVIS: Whatcha going to do with all this--

1579
00:57:29.081 --> 00:57:31.182
SAM: (laughs)
ASHLEY: Okay.

1580
00:57:31.182 --> 00:57:32.015
MATT: I thought you were going to say,

SAM: Ooh yeah.

1585
00:57:39.091 --> 00:57:41.820
ASHLEY: It's a bonus action, this is for everybody.

1586
00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:44.980
I'll unleash a battle cry and up to 10 other creatures,

1587
00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:48.270
all of you guys, you gain advantage

1588
00:57:48.270 --> 00:57:49.931

1589
00:57:49.931 --> 00:57:51.599
MARISHA and LAURA: Oh!
MATT: For the next round, right?

1590
00:57:51.599 --> 00:57:52.590
ASHLEY: Until the start of

1591
00:57:52.590 --> 00:57:53.600

MATT: Right.

1592
00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:54.880
Oh, so the start of your next turn.

1593
00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:56.239
ASHLEY: 'Til the start of my next turn.

1594

LAURA: Awesome!
ASHLEY: This round--

1595
00:57:57.659 --> 00:57:58.880
MATT: You strike twice, the guy doesn't go down

1596
00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:00.170
and starts lumbering towards you angrily.

1597
00:58:00.170 --> 00:58:03.430
You just go (roars) and you give out

1598
00:58:03.430 --> 00:58:05.840
this piercing fallen angel scream

1599
00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:08.170
that echoes through the middle of this swamp.

1600
00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:11.260
You guys hear this, as the echo

1601
00:58:11.260 --> 00:58:14.726
(echoing), you hear (thunder rumbling).

1602
00:58:14.726 --> 00:58:15.834
LAURA: Oh shit.

1603
00:58:15.834 --> 00:58:19.310
MATT: A stormless sky, yet you hear thunder rolling

1604
00:58:19.310 --> 00:58:21.669
and a flash in the distance as the Stormlord's

1605
00:58:21.669 --> 00:58:23.152
power empowers you and your friends.

1606
00:58:23.152 --> 00:58:24.685
ASHLEY: That's so much cooler than
I thought it was going to be.

1607
00:58:24.685 --> 00:58:26.940
It's within 60 feet.
MATT: That's all of them.

1608
00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:28.660
ASHLEY: That's everybody? Okay, great.

1609
00:58:28.660 --> 00:58:31.510
MATT: Finished your go?
ASHLEY: That'll be my go.

1610
00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:33.448
MATT: All right, it's their turn.
TALIESIN: That's real good.

1611
00:58:33.448 --> 00:58:34.970
MATT: This guy's just going to run right over

1612
00:58:34.970 --> 00:58:37.674
to Jester and this guy's going to stay put.

1613
00:58:37.674 --> 00:58:39.490
ASHLEY: I forgot about that.

1614
00:58:39.490 --> 00:58:42.140
MATT: This guy's going to-- I think, yeah,

1615
00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:45.430
this guy moves in and tries to push past.

1616
00:58:45.430 --> 00:58:47.730
LAURA: Oh my god, this is terrifying.

1617
00:58:47.730 --> 00:58:48.670
MATT: That's as far as they can

1618
00:58:48.670 --> 00:58:50.573
get there.
LAURA: Like the visual.

1619
00:58:51.732 --> 00:58:53.890
TALIESIN: That one's unaffected.
LAURA: No, he's not affected

1620
00:58:53.890 --> 00:58:55.490
but the next, yeah, that guy is.

1621
00:58:56.560 --> 00:58:58.180
SAM: Do we get attacks of opportunity?

1622
00:58:58.180 --> 00:59:00.140
MATT: Fjord does.
LAURA: That guy was affected.

1623
00:59:00.140 --> 00:59:01.950
TRAVIS: But we can hold it if we want to.

1624
00:59:01.950 --> 00:59:02.783
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: Yeah.

1625
00:59:02.783 --> 00:59:03.880
TRAVIS: Okay.
LIAM: If you hit one--

1626
00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:05.110
MATT: Correct.
LIAM: It doesn't break on all,

1627
00:59:05.110 --> 00:59:06.040
does it?
LAURA: No.

1628
00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:06.873
MATT: It just breaks on the one.

1629
00:59:06.873 --> 00:59:08.470
So you're not giving an attack of opportunity?

1630
00:59:09.342 --> 00:59:10.592
TRAVIS: I'm going to listen to--

1631
00:59:10.592 --> 00:59:12.474
MATT: One, two, three, four.

1632
00:59:12.474 --> 00:59:13.757
Yeah, can get right there.

1633
00:59:13.757 --> 00:59:16.000
LAURA: What about that little guy over by the tree?

1634
00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:17.100
MATT: Right here?
LAURA: Yeah.

1635
00:59:18.673 --> 00:59:20.363
SAM: (whimpers)

1636
00:59:20.363 --> 00:59:23.480
MATT: That's as far as he gets there.

1637
00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:25.020
All right, so they all move forward.

1638
00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:25.930
All of a sudden--
SAM: Those two are unaffected?

1639
00:59:25.930 --> 00:59:27.320
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: Those two are unaffected

1640
00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:29.175
and that, so three of them are unaffected currently.

1641
00:59:29.175 --> 00:59:31.140
So Jester, you watch them all swarm

1642
00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:35.910
and you hear this whole chorus of (groans).

1643
00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:38.260
You look around you and they're all

1644
00:59:38.260 --> 00:59:40.860
glaring in your direction, some with both eyes,

1645
00:59:40.860 --> 00:59:43.480
some with the one eye they have, some with no eyes

1646
00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:44.960
but the very force that holds them together

1647
00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:48.420
through necrotic, arcane, terrible magic

1648
00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:50.530
that rocks into this swamp is still looking

1649
00:59:50.530 --> 00:59:53.210
right in your direction and it's not fun.

1650
00:59:53.210 --> 00:59:54.260
LAURA: Help.

1651
00:59:54.260 --> 00:59:56.470
MATT: The one that's still upon you that's pulled apart

1652
00:59:56.470 --> 00:59:58.229
is going to go ahead and strike you twice, Yasha.

1653
00:59:58.229 --> 00:59:59.674
ASHLEY: Okay.

1654
00:59:59.674 --> 01:00:02.915
MATT: Ah, natural one and an 18.

1655
01:00:02.915 --> 01:00:03.748
ASHLEY: That hits.

1656
01:00:03.748 --> 01:00:06.230
MATT: All right, so you do take

1657
01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:08.240
five points of slashing damage, reduced to two

1658
01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:09.431
because you're raging.

1659
01:00:09.431 --> 01:00:10.264
ASHLEY: Tight.

1660
01:00:10.264 --> 01:00:12.430
MATT: Fjord, two attacks against you.

1661
01:00:12.430 --> 01:00:13.446
TRAVIS: All right.

1662
01:00:13.446 --> 01:00:16.413
MATT: And this one's going to move in a bit to about there,

1663
01:00:16.413 --> 01:00:19.170
fill the gap between the three of you and

1664
01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:23.560
yep, it's going to take two strikes against you.

1665
01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:24.621
TRAVIS: All right.

1666
01:00:25.764 --> 01:00:27.760
MATT: That's cocked, there.

1667
01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:28.660
Okay, there we go.

1668
01:00:30.006 --> 01:00:32.564
An eight and a 21.

1669
01:00:32.564 --> 01:00:34.146
TRAVIS: 21 hits.

1670
01:00:34.146 --> 01:00:36.340
MATT: Cocked on that one.

1671
01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:38.650
Ooh, eight points of slashing damage on that one.

1672
01:00:38.650 --> 01:00:41.580
TRAVIS: And he will take seven
points of radiant damage as the

1673
01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:44.770
sword bursts with radiant energy each time I'm struck.

1674
01:00:45.850 --> 01:00:49.390
MATT: As it hits him, he rushes past.

1675
01:00:49.390 --> 01:00:53.030
The impact of that radiant energy burns up the back

1676
01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:55.160
and you see the neck snap from

1677
01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:57.090
the tendons that are no longer holding it up,

1678
01:00:57.090 --> 01:00:59.960
its head (creaking) dangles there

1679
01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:02.331
and the mouth goes (growls).

1680
01:01:02.331 --> 01:01:04.910
ASHLEY: Oh my--
MATT: It's hanging on by a thread.

1681
01:01:04.910 --> 01:01:07.783
ASHLEY: That's so cool.
MARISHA: Yeah.

1682
01:01:07.783 --> 01:01:10.778
MATT: Then this one here is going to rush over to you, Nott.

1683
01:01:10.778 --> 01:01:12.444
SAM: (screaming)
MATT: Around the corner and make two strikes

1684
01:01:12.444 --> 01:01:14.156
against you.
SAM: No!

1685
01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:16.450
MATT: Oh shit.

1686
01:01:16.450 --> 01:01:18.007
LAURA: Shit.

1687
01:01:18.007 --> 01:01:20.267
MATT: 20 and a natural 20.

1688
01:01:20.267 --> 01:01:21.401
(groaning)

1689
01:01:21.401 --> 01:01:22.567
SAM: Both hit.
ASHLEY: Dang.

1690
01:01:22.567 --> 01:01:24.890
TALIESIN: I can counter the natural 20 on that one,

1691
01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:26.530
though, because now I have a reaction.

1692
01:01:26.530 --> 01:01:28.780
TRAVIS: New turn.
MATT: You do,

1693
01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:29.730
now you do, yes.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1694
01:01:29.730 --> 01:01:31.450
So no natural, no crit on you.

1695
01:01:31.450 --> 01:01:33.139
SAM: Okay.
TRAVIS: Gimme a snap.

1696
01:01:33.139 --> 01:01:33.972
(snapping)

1697
01:01:33.972 --> 01:01:35.570
MATT: Technically, you would have got your

1698
01:01:35.570 --> 01:01:38.743
reaction back because you got your turn--

1699
01:01:38.743 --> 01:01:40.200
TRAVIS: It was in the same turn, the last time.

1700
01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:41.651
MATT: No, you're right, you're right.

1701
01:01:41.651 --> 01:01:42.634
TALIESIN: We cool.

1702
01:01:42.634 --> 01:01:43.488
MATT: Yeah yeah, I was making sure.

1703
01:01:43.488 --> 01:01:45.426
Anyway, it's fine, you can do it.

1704
01:01:45.426 --> 01:01:46.370
(laughter)

1705
01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:47.336
MATT: So it's just two damage.

1706
01:01:47.336 --> 01:01:48.620
TALIESIN: Lemme mark that.

1707
01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:49.540
MATT: That is

1708
01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:55.500
11 points of slashing damage to you, Nott.

1709
01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:57.133
SAM: For both or the first?

1710
01:01:57.133 --> 01:01:58.240
MATT: For both.

1711
01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:00.190
SAM: Oh, okay.
MATT: Not as much

1712
01:02:00.190 --> 01:02:04.450
because the crit got canceled by Caduceus there.

1713
01:02:04.450 --> 01:02:05.880
That finishes their turn.

1714
01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:07.320
That brings us to Nott, you're up.

1715
01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:09.050
Caduceus, you're on deck.
SAM: Oh boy.

1716
01:02:09.050 --> 01:02:12.590
I'm stuck in front of this fellow, I don't like it.

1717
01:02:14.487 --> 01:02:16.160
Well, I can't do what I wanted to do,

1718
01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:20.360
so I will say: Fjord, cover your eyes!

1719
01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:23.520
And I will fire through the one in front of me at the one

1720
01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:25.687
engaged with Fjord.
MATT: Okay.

1721
01:02:29.284 --> 01:02:30.617
What'd you roll?
SAM: 15.

1722
01:02:30.617 --> 01:02:32.820
MATT: 15, that'll hit, go to roll damage.

1723
01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:35.810
As it shoots through, not only are you pushing past Fjord

1724
01:02:35.810 --> 01:02:37.000
but you're also waiting for a moment

1725
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.690
where the giant gorilla that's slamming towards it

1726
01:02:39.690 --> 01:02:42.120
brings the fists up and you streak past

1727
01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:43.590
and still manage to hit the creature.

1728
01:02:43.590 --> 01:02:44.840
SAM: Like a million points.

1729
01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:46.590
LAURA: Oh my god.

1730
01:02:46.590 --> 01:02:48.501
MATT: It had one hit point.

1731
01:02:48.501 --> 01:02:49.993
You hit it.

1732
01:02:49.993 --> 01:02:51.814
LAURA: What a waste of all those amazing rolls.
SAM: I know.

1733
01:02:51.814 --> 01:02:54.530
MATT: And he collapses and falls into the swamp, unmoving.

1734
01:02:55.634 --> 01:02:57.744
Then his body swells.
ALL: Ugh!

1735
01:02:57.744 --> 01:02:59.914
MATT: It explodes and poison all around you.

1736
01:02:59.914 --> 01:03:01.590
I need Beauregard, I need gorilla man,

1737
01:03:01.590 --> 01:03:03.080
and I need Fjord to go ahead and make--

1738
01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:04.790
TALIESIN: Not Beau.
MARISHA: I'm good.

1739
01:03:04.790 --> 01:03:05.770
MATT: Oh, not Beau because you're fine.

1740
01:03:05.770 --> 01:03:09.200
TALIESIN: With advantage and a d4.
MATT: Yep.

1741
01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:11.480
TRAVIS: Oh, with advantage?
TALIESIN: With advantage and a d4.

1742
01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:14.007
TRAVIS: Way better.

1743
01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:17.373
25.

1744
01:03:17.373 --> 01:03:18.790
MATT: 25, nice.

1745
01:03:18.790 --> 01:03:21.220
You take eight points of poison damage.

1746
01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:22.470
TRAVIS: Okay.
LIAM: 20.

1747
01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:25.610
MATT: You take eight points of poison damage.

1748
01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:29.170
There you go.

1749
01:03:29.170 --> 01:03:31.250
SAM: Climbing is an action?

1750
01:03:31.250 --> 01:03:32.525
Or is it a movement?

1751
01:03:32.525 --> 01:03:33.925
MATT: You can climb

1752
01:03:33.925 --> 01:03:37.110
a certain amount with half. Your movement is very minimized,

1753
01:03:37.110 --> 01:03:38.726
but you can attempt it.

1754
01:03:38.726 --> 01:03:39.559
SAM: Hm.

1755
01:03:40.990 --> 01:03:43.056
Ah-hmm, ah-hmm.

1756
01:03:43.056 --> 01:03:43.889
(laughter)

1757
01:03:43.889 --> 01:03:46.070
SAM: I will disengage with the one in front of me.

1758
01:03:46.070 --> 01:03:48.890
MATT: Okay.
SAM: And I will run and

1759
01:03:48.890 --> 01:03:51.539
slide under, between

1760
01:03:51.539 --> 01:03:53.730
Capeleb's

1761
01:03:55.310 --> 01:03:57.380
legs, between his legs just to--

1762
01:03:57.380 --> 01:03:59.570
ASHLEY: Capeleb?
SAM and LAURA: Capeleb.

1763
01:03:59.570 --> 01:04:00.820
MATT: Just rush through and come to the other side,

1764
01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:02.030
you mean?
SAM: Yeah.

1765
01:04:02.030 --> 01:04:03.330
MATT: Yeah, that's doable.

1766
01:04:03.330 --> 01:04:05.000
You run and you slide

1767
01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.500
and because it's all slick marshland,

1768
01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:07.900
it Slip 'N Slides you

1769
01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:10.310
through the gorilla's legs and out the other side.

1770
01:04:10.310 --> 01:04:11.970
You catch yourself and look up.

1771
01:04:11.970 --> 01:04:13.055
SAM: Ooh, I went over a rock.

1772
01:04:13.055 --> 01:04:15.574
MATT: Yep. You almost got, looking up,
foreheaded by the monkey wang.

1773
01:04:15.574 --> 01:04:17.688
(laughter)

1774
01:04:17.688 --> 01:04:19.229
MATT: All righty, that finishes Nott's--
LAURA: Did they all make saving throws

1775
01:04:19.229 --> 01:04:21.470
at the end of their turn to see if they broke the--

1776
01:04:21.470 --> 01:04:23.340
MATT: We should do that now.
LAURA: Yeah.

1777
01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:25.260
MATT: All right, so those,

1778
01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:28.095
him?

1779
01:04:28.095 --> 01:04:28.928
Fail.

1780
01:04:28.928 --> 01:04:30.130
Him?

1781
01:04:30.130 --> 01:04:30.963
Fail.

1782
01:04:30.963 --> 01:04:32.220
Him?

1783
01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:33.053
Fail.

1784
01:04:33.053 --> 01:04:34.300
Him?

1785
01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:35.133
Fail.

1786
01:04:35.133 --> 01:04:36.567
Him?

1787
01:04:36.567 --> 01:04:37.734
That's cocked.

1788
01:04:38.730 --> 01:04:40.090
Succeed.
SAM: Oh!

1789
01:04:40.090 --> 01:04:40.923
MATT: He is free.

1790
01:04:40.923 --> 01:04:43.270
I'm going to mark that just so I have it.

1791
01:04:44.447 --> 01:04:45.555
That one?

1792
01:04:45.555 --> 01:04:47.240
MARISHA: Very patriarchal society--
MATT: Fail.

1793
01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:48.350
That one?
MARISHA: Of zombies.

1794
01:04:48.350 --> 01:04:50.080
MATT: Fail.
LAURA: Wow.

1795
01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:50.913
TRAVIS: What?

1796
01:04:50.913 --> 01:04:51.860
SAM: They really like your diamond.

1797
01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:53.700
MATT: They <i>really</i> like that diamond.

1798
01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:55.740
They have a shitty wisdom saving throw.

1799
01:04:55.740 --> 01:04:56.720
LIAM: What about this one?

1800
01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:58.110
SAM: Yeah, I don't think Matt can see that one.

1801
01:04:58.110 --> 01:04:59.090
LIAM: Do you see this one behind the tree?

1802
01:04:59.090 --> 01:05:01.330
MATT: Oh shit, yeah, I'm blocking my own self.

1803
01:05:01.330 --> 01:05:03.680
He would have gone--
TRAVIS: I was blocking myself.

1804
01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:04.513
MATT: As well.

1805
01:05:04.513 --> 01:05:05.920
Just to mark that off there, Caduceus,

1806
01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:07.390
you do have two attacks on you from the one

1807
01:05:07.390 --> 01:05:08.550
that you blasted back last round that

1808
01:05:08.550 --> 01:05:09.770
did catch up, thank you for the reminder.

1809
01:05:09.770 --> 01:05:11.630
I was blocking with my own terrain.

1810
01:05:11.630 --> 01:05:13.227
SAM: Too much terrain.

1811
01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:17.200
MATT: That is a-- cocked that one-- 23 and a 20.

1812
01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:20.010
TALIESIN: Those hit.
MATT: All right.

1813
01:05:20.010 --> 01:05:24.375
You take 12 points of slashing damage.

1814
01:05:24.375 --> 01:05:25.910
As the one that you blasted back now

1815
01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:27.680
scoots towards you really low to the ground

1816
01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:29.740
and as it comes up, it rakes you twice upward

1817
01:05:29.740 --> 01:05:32.036
with these rising claw strikes.

1818
01:05:32.036 --> 01:05:34.930
TRAVIS: For Pete's sake.
ASHLEY: Aw, for Pete's sake.

1819
01:05:34.930 --> 01:05:37.510
TALIESIN: How am I-- I'm in contact with, oh my god,

1820
01:05:37.510 --> 01:05:38.900
I've got a lot of them around me, don't I?

1821
01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:40.294
MATT: Yeah. A lot of them just rushed past you

1822
01:05:40.294 --> 01:05:42.040
and are staring at Jester, but one of them did

1823
01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:43.660
manage to come--
TALIESIN: One of them,

1824
01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:44.860
I'm engaged with one.

1825
01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:46.580
MATT: Correct.
TALIESIN: Okay.

1826
01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:47.620
MATT: All right, so that brings us to the end

1827
01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:48.710
of Nott's turn, Caduceus, you're up.

1828
01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:49.760
Beau, you're on deck.

1829
01:05:51.299 --> 01:05:54.750
TALIESIN: I'm trying to take a look at what's going on.

1830
01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:57.158
First thing I'm going to do is I'm going to

1831
01:05:57.158 --> 01:05:58.613
take my movement.

1832
01:05:58.613 --> 01:06:02.080
I'm actually, yeah, I'm going to take my movement,

1833
01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:05.090
I'm going to come as far out this way as I can.

1834
01:06:07.450 --> 01:06:08.600
MATT: That's as far as you can get to there,

1835
01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:09.900
next to the floating stump.

1836
01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:11.270
You're up to waist-high in water.

1837
01:06:11.270 --> 01:06:12.330
TALIESIN: Cool, cool, cool.
MATT: That one that just

1838
01:06:12.330 --> 01:06:15.237
attacked you does get attack of opportunity against you.

1839
01:06:15.237 --> 01:06:18.590
And rolls a natural one, so it goes to strike towards you

1840
01:06:18.590 --> 01:06:21.660
and just slips and then falls into the water

1841
01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:23.760
and spends the rest of the the next round of actions

1842
01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:26.020
just trying to get out of the muck.

1843
01:06:26.020 --> 01:06:27.827
What're you doing?

1844
01:06:27.827 --> 01:06:29.085
TALIESIN: Are we doing a thing?

1845
01:06:29.085 --> 01:06:31.123
LAURA: We can do the thing, mm hm.

1846
01:06:31.123 --> 01:06:33.140
SAM: What's the thing?
TALIESIN: I'm going to hold

1847
01:06:33.140 --> 01:06:35.230
Turn Undead and I'm going to wait for

1848
01:06:35.230 --> 01:06:37.046
Jester's signal.

1849
01:06:37.046 --> 01:06:38.737
MATT: Okay, you got it.

1850
01:06:38.737 --> 01:06:40.700
You're holding Turn Undead as an action.

1851
01:06:40.700 --> 01:06:42.100
That finishes your go.

1852
01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:43.883
That brings us to Beauregard.

1853
01:06:43.883 --> 01:06:44.920
MARISHA: Do I see

1854
01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:47.210
any of this signaling happening?

1855
01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:51.300
MATT: Right now, you are--
MARISHA: Do I have any clue, huh?

1856
01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:53.130
MATT: They haven't made a signal
towards you, so probably not.

1857
01:06:53.130 --> 01:06:54.640
MARISHA: All right.
LAURA: We were standing next to each other.

1858
01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:58.060
MARISHA: The zombie Jesus and the guy who was next to me,

1859
01:06:58.060 --> 01:06:59.630
I'm just going to keep whaling on them.

1860
01:06:59.630 --> 01:07:00.811
MATT: Go for it.

1861
01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:04.248
MARISHA: And I have an advantage on attack rolls?

1862
01:07:04.248 --> 01:07:06.416
MATT: You do, yep.

1863
01:07:06.416 --> 01:07:07.949
MARISHA: Okay, first one.

1864
01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:10.850
21.
MATT: That hits.

1865
01:07:10.850 --> 01:07:13.600
MARISHA: Second one, ooh, 13.

1866
01:07:15.070 --> 01:07:15.903
MATT: Both hit.

1867
01:07:15.903 --> 01:07:17.820
MARISHA: I rolled a natural one and a three.

1868
01:07:17.820 --> 01:07:19.270
MATT: Natural one misses automatically.

1869
01:07:19.270 --> 01:07:21.523
LAURA: No, but that was--
MARISHA: No, with advantage.

1870
01:07:21.523 --> 01:07:22.954
MATT: Oh with advantage, Right, yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah.

1871
01:07:22.954 --> 01:07:24.037
So both hit.

1872
01:07:25.850 --> 01:07:27.230
Yeah, one to each.
MATT: Go for it.

1873
01:07:27.230 --> 01:07:28.520
MARISHA: First one, wait, did you say something

1874
01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:30.090
about advantage on attack rolls?

1875
01:07:30.090 --> 01:07:31.490
MATT: Yep.
ASHLEY: Yep.

1876
01:07:31.490 --> 01:07:33.540
MARISHA: So wait, you get to re-roll it if you don't--

1877
01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:35.020
MATT: No, attack rolls, not damage.

1878
01:07:35.898 --> 01:07:37.010
MARISHA: Oh, okay.

1879
01:07:37.010 --> 01:07:38.570
Not damage, not damage.
MATT: Correct.

1880
01:07:38.570 --> 01:07:40.230
ASHLEY: Attack rolls and saving throws.

1881
01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:42.500
MARISHA: And saving throws.
TALIESIN: You don't really need--

1882
01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:45.475
MARISHA: Okay, 11 to zombie Jesus.

1883
01:07:45.475 --> 01:07:47.520
MATT: Zombie Jesus falls--

1884
01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:49.076
SAM: Zombie Jesus!
LAURA: Oh!

1885
01:07:49.076 --> 01:07:50.410
MATT: And the other one, how much?

1886
01:07:50.410 --> 01:07:51.823
SAM: Can't be killed.
LIAM: Don't worry, he'll rise again.

1887
01:07:51.823 --> 01:07:53.797
SAM: Oh okay, you're right.
MARISHA: And the other one is nine.

1888
01:07:53.797 --> 01:07:56.210
LAURA: Don't let zombie Jesus fall because he'll knock the--

1889
01:07:56.210 --> 01:07:57.736
TRAVIS: We got three days, we got three days.

1890
01:07:57.736 --> 01:07:58.686
LAURA: The other ones aren't affected by

1891
01:07:58.686 --> 01:07:59.927
the poison, so it's fine.

1892
01:07:59.927 --> 01:08:01.080
They don't take damage.
TALIESIN: They don't take damage.

1893
01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:02.710
LAURA: Okay, good.
TALIESIN: Burn themselves.

1894
01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:06.460
MATT: Both of those, you punch, and as you hit them,

1895
01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:09.627
like piñatas filled with toxic juice, they both

1896
01:08:09.627 --> 01:08:10.730
(laughter)
MATT: (explosions)

1897
01:08:10.730 --> 01:08:14.400
Explode, scattering venomous liquid

1898
01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:16.120
across the field around all of you.

1899
01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:17.930
MARISHA: Just for a second, it goes slow motion

1900
01:08:17.930 --> 01:08:22.598
and Beau just like, Flashdance bathes--
LAURA: In the poison.

1901
01:08:22.598 --> 01:08:23.664
MARISHA: In the goop.
TALIESIN: With your friends

1902
01:08:23.664 --> 01:08:24.630
behind you screaming in pain.

1903
01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:26.930
MARISHA: Yeah. Yes.
MATT: That's amazing.

1904
01:08:26.930 --> 01:08:29.150
Very metal, very metal.

1905
01:08:29.150 --> 01:08:32.310
To that, I need Jester

1906
01:08:32.310 --> 01:08:35.700
and you, monkey man, to make

1907
01:08:35.700 --> 01:08:37.290
a constitution saving throw

1908
01:08:37.290 --> 01:08:39.622
with advantage, as of Yasha's epic scream--

1909
01:08:39.622 --> 01:08:41.580
TALIESIN: I asked her how to
make a constitution saving throw

1910
01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:44.440
because I was attacked and I have a spell up, but I--

1911
01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:45.490
LAURA: Oh, yeah.
TALIESIN: Just rolled a 20,

1912
01:08:45.490 --> 01:08:46.920
everything's fine.
SAM: What should you do,

1913
01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:49.681
throw this diamond and make them chase it away?
LAURA: 19.

1914
01:08:49.681 --> 01:08:51.200
MATT: 19? Okay.

1915
01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:52.310
Oh, shit, okay.

1916
01:08:52.310 --> 01:08:53.170
That is

1917
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:56.730
20 points--
LAURA: Oh wait, I would add

1918
01:08:56.730 --> 01:08:57.880
a d4 to that?

1919
01:08:57.880 --> 01:08:59.700
No, that's just for--
TALIESIN: Saving throws.

1920
01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:02.480
LAURA: Yeah, so I would've added a d4.

1921
01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:03.830
Oh, so what'd I say, 19?

1922
01:09:03.830 --> 01:09:05.170
20.
MATT: So 10 points of damage.

1923
01:09:05.170 --> 01:09:07.227
Go ahead and make a constitution check

1924
01:09:07.227 --> 01:09:08.510
or a constitution saving throw

1925
01:09:08.510 --> 01:09:09.400
to see if you maintain your spell.

1926
01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:10.910
TALIESIN: Constitution saving throw also has advantage

1927
01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:11.743
and a d4.
MATT: Yep.

1928
01:09:11.743 --> 01:09:13.243
Yes it does.
ASHLEY: Yep.

1929
01:09:15.190 --> 01:09:17.162
LAURA: Okay.
TALIESIN: Ooh. Ooh!

1930
01:09:17.162 --> 01:09:18.012
LAURA: Ooh!

1931
01:09:18.012 --> 01:09:20.278
17 plus three, 20.

1932
01:09:20.278 --> 01:09:22.310
MATT: Okay, so you maintain concentration on your spells.

1933
01:09:22.310 --> 01:09:24.820
The other blast, I'm going to need Nott--

1934
01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:26.210
just Nott to make a constitution throw.

1935
01:09:26.210 --> 01:09:27.170
LIAM: I need to roll as well.

1936
01:09:27.170 --> 01:09:28.180
MATT: Yeah, oh, sorry.
LIAM: 21.

1937
01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:29.300
MATT: 21, so that's another 10 points

1938
01:09:29.300 --> 01:09:30.270
of poison damage to your monkey.

1939
01:09:30.270 --> 01:09:32.200
TALIESIN: And you also have advantage with a d4.

1940
01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:34.410
LAURA: Oh yeah, you get advantage--
TALIESIN: And a d4 added.

1941
01:09:34.410 --> 01:09:36.743
SAM: Oh, that's slightly better.
LAURA: Still bad.

1942
01:09:36.743 --> 01:09:38.660
SAM: Constitu--
SAM: Yep.

1943
01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:40.462
TALIESIN: You've got your d4.
SAM: Plus a d4.

1944
01:09:40.462 --> 01:09:41.790
Not real good.

1945
01:09:41.790 --> 01:09:44.680
Right now I'm at a nine and now I'm at an 11.

1946
01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:46.070
MATT: That's still a fail.

1947
01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:47.860
You take 16 points of poison damage.

1948
01:09:47.860 --> 01:09:50.580
SAM: I'm going to use uncanny something?

1949
01:09:50.580 --> 01:09:52.040
No, it's an area affect.

1950
01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:54.407
MATT: Yes, constitution save is
not a dexterity saving throw.

1951
01:09:54.407 --> 01:09:55.760
SAM: Evas--?
MATT: Actually, no, it's not.

1952
01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:57.624
It's for half damage, right?

1953
01:09:57.624 --> 01:09:59.631
SAM: Evasion?
MATT: Lemme check, lemme check.

1954
01:09:59.631 --> 01:10:01.547
TALIESIN: Dancing between the raindrops.

1955
01:10:01.547 --> 01:10:03.734
MATT: Kind of, yeah.

1956
01:10:03.734 --> 01:10:06.575
Double check the wording on the rogue ability here.

1957
01:10:06.575 --> 01:10:08.516
LAURA: Maybe you can duck underwater for a second.

1958
01:10:08.516 --> 01:10:09.550
SAM: Sure.

1959
01:10:09.550 --> 01:10:10.510
No no, I can't--
LAURA: You're little.

1960
01:10:10.510 --> 01:10:12.280
SAM: I don't like that.
LAURA: Well, you could.

1961
01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:13.940
MATT: Dexterity saving throws.

1962
01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:15.320
it's constitution, so it is unaffected

1963
01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:16.710
by evasion, unfortunately.

1964
01:10:16.710 --> 01:10:19.400
SAM: 16 points.
MATT: 16 points of poison damage to you.

1965
01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:20.233
All righty.

1966
01:10:20.233 --> 01:10:21.130
TALIESIN: Does your ring make it so that

1967
01:10:21.130 --> 01:10:22.613
you can run full speed on a--

1968
01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:24.970
SAM: I have been running full speed--

1969
01:10:24.970 --> 01:10:26.150
TALIESIN: Okay.
SAM: But I don't know if

1970
01:10:26.150 --> 01:10:27.410
that's because of the ring or just because

1971
01:10:27.410 --> 01:10:29.087
I'm awesome.
TALIESIN: Oh, that's fair.

1972
01:10:29.087 --> 01:10:29.920
MATT: Well, because of the ring, you don't

1973
01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:31.400
have to worry about the terrain.

1974
01:10:32.242 --> 01:10:33.230
SAM: I'm going to go possum.

1975
01:10:33.230 --> 01:10:35.140
TALIESIN: I'm drinking chai.

1976
01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:39.260
MATT: That is now from Caduceus', now Beau's turn, to Caleb.

1977
01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:40.190
Caleb, you're up, Jester, you're on deck.

1978
01:10:40.190 --> 01:10:42.420
LIAM: This is a whole crowd of them still staring at Jester

1979
01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:44.950
and this one in red is the one that is active.

1980
01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:46.410
MATT: This one in red and this one

1981
01:10:46.410 --> 01:10:49.072
and the one that's still attacking Yasha over there,

1982
01:10:49.072 --> 01:10:50.550
those are the three that are currently unaffected.

1983
01:10:50.550 --> 01:10:52.149
LIAM: All right. Where the monkey is looking,

1984
01:10:52.149 --> 01:10:54.150
he can see this one who is red and turns over

1985
01:10:54.150 --> 01:10:57.620
and sees it snarling at Jester.

1986
01:10:57.620 --> 01:10:59.060
He is a monkey, he goes forward

1987
01:10:59.060 --> 01:11:00.400
and pounds it into the ground.

1988
01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:02.070
LAURA: Ugh, but then--
MATT: He'll have to move over here

1989
01:11:02.070 --> 01:11:02.953
to make space for it.

1990
01:11:02.953 --> 01:11:05.040
LAURA: Maybe throw him away from me?

1991
01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:07.003
MATT: Go for it, make the attacks.

1992
01:11:07.003 --> 01:11:09.420
SAM: (whispering) Can I see your spell?

1993
01:11:11.456 --> 01:11:14.089
LAURA: I keep having to make concentration--

1994
01:11:14.089 --> 01:11:15.089
LIAM: Lemme see.
SAM: Where is it?

1995
01:11:15.089 --> 01:11:16.955
LIAM: What's his intelligence? Hold on a second.

1996
01:11:16.955 --> 01:11:18.230
His intelligence is seven,

1997
01:11:18.230 --> 01:11:19.680
that is exactly what he does.

1998
01:11:21.839 --> 01:11:23.889
Okay, so that's 3d10. This is--

1999
01:11:24.790 --> 01:11:26.470
TALIESIN: Who's fucked?

2000
01:11:26.470 --> 01:11:29.790
Okay, just checking, just checking who's fucked.

2001
01:11:29.790 --> 01:11:32.190
LIAM: The first is a 24.

2002
01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:35.281
MATT: 24 to hit? All right, that hits.

2003
01:11:35.281 --> 01:11:36.114
LIAM: And then--

2004
01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:39.100
24.

2005
01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:40.100
MATT: Both hit.
LIAM: Yeah.

2006
01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:46.970
MATT: Is that the attacks or the damage?

2007
01:11:46.970 --> 01:11:48.000
LIAM: That's the damage.

2008
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.840
MATT: Both hits?
LIAM: I should

2009
01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:51.640
probably roll to hit.

2010
01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:52.670
And it's an advantage for him, yes?

2011
01:11:52.670 --> 01:11:54.220
MATT: Correct.
TALIESIN: With a d4.

2012
01:11:54.220 --> 01:11:56.340
LIAM: With a d4, so--
MATT: The first one is?

2013
01:11:56.340 --> 01:11:59.170
LIAM: 10, 10, 10 is 19--
MATT: That hits.

2014
01:11:59.170 --> 01:12:01.242
LIAM: Plus a four, okay.
MARISHA: Wait.

2015
01:12:01.242 --> 01:12:02.291
That's a 20.
LIAM: That's a 20.

2016
01:12:02.291 --> 01:12:04.890
Yeah, one's a, oh no, that's not, an advantage.

2017
01:12:04.890 --> 01:12:07.430
MARISHA: Yeah, that's a 20.
LIAM: (sighs) Got distracted.

2018
01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:08.580
MARISHA: Yep. No, you're good.

2019
01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:09.929
MATT: It's fine. Roll the second attack to see if

2020
01:12:09.929 --> 01:12:11.234
it hits.
LIAM: Okay.

2021
01:12:13.130 --> 01:12:15.310
That is only a

2022
01:12:15.310 --> 01:12:17.240
11 plus two is 13.

2023
01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:18.900
MATT: Both hit, all damage is there.

2024
01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:21.660
Even without the critical hit, that was enough to kill it.

2025
01:12:21.660 --> 01:12:23.800
LIAM: Okay.
SAM: Yeah.

2026
01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:25.990
MATT: That one explodes once more.

2027
01:12:25.990 --> 01:12:29.520
This time as it does, it sprays an upward geyser

2028
01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:32.760
of greenish-brackish liquid and it

2029
01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:35.630
rains down on the immediate vicinity around where it was.

2030
01:12:35.630 --> 01:12:40.080
I need Jester and yourself to go ahead,

2031
01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:42.240
and Yasha, to make constitution saving throws, please.

2032
01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:44.064
TALIESIN: With a d4.

2033
01:12:45.690 --> 01:12:46.730
MATT: Oh, shit.

2034
01:12:46.730 --> 01:12:48.320
LIAM: And this gets a d4 to this as well.

2035
01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:50.310
TALIESIN: Yep.

2036
01:12:51.610 --> 01:12:53.213
MATT: Yasha.
ASHLEY: 12.

2037
01:12:53.213 --> 01:12:55.310
MATT: 12, you just barely make it, that is,

2038
01:12:55.310 --> 01:12:56.540
you take 10 points of poison damage.

2039
01:12:56.540 --> 01:12:58.400
ASHLEY: Okay.
LAURA: 10.

2040
01:12:58.400 --> 01:12:59.750
MATT: 20 points of poison damage to you, Jester,

2041
01:12:59.750 --> 01:13:00.827
and I need you to go ahead and make

2042
01:13:00.827 --> 01:13:03.118
a constitution saving throw with advantage.

2043
01:13:03.118 --> 01:13:04.573
TALIESIN: And a d4.
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

2044
01:13:04.573 --> 01:13:05.406
LIAM: 18.

2045
01:13:05.406 --> 01:13:07.360
MATT: 18. You take 10 points of poison damage.

2046
01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:08.193
LAURA: Yep.

2047
01:13:10.116 --> 01:13:10.949
TALIESIN: Oh, that's nice.
LAURA: Yeah, that's good.

2048
01:13:10.949 --> 01:13:12.190
TALIESIN: That's nice.

2049
01:13:12.190 --> 01:13:16.420
LAURA: I rolled 19 plus three, so 22.

2050
01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:18.650
MATT: Yeah, so you still manage
to maintain your concentration.

2051
01:13:18.650 --> 01:13:20.470
SAM: Yes.
MATT: Yeah, you're fine.

2052
01:13:20.470 --> 01:13:22.930
All righty, that finish your turn, Caleb?

2053
01:13:22.930 --> 01:13:24.400
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: All right.

2054
01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:27.950
Also, I think because you took the damage,

2055
01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:30.230
you took 10 points of damage?
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

2056
01:13:30.230 --> 01:13:32.760
MATT: I'm trying to think.
You still have to make concentration checks for the--

2057
01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:33.740
LIAM: Oh, for the--
MATT: Polymorph form.

2058
01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:34.573
LIAM: Okay.
MATT: Just make

2059
01:13:34.573 --> 01:13:35.981
a couple for me, real fast.

2060
01:13:35.981 --> 01:13:38.720
TALIESIN: With advantage and a d4.
LIAM: It's already an advantage because I'm--

2061
01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:40.864
MATT: Correct.
LIAM: -- War Caster.

2062
01:13:41.730 --> 01:13:44.130
SAM: War Caster.
LIAM: 16.

2063
01:13:44.130 --> 01:13:44.963
MATT: You're fine.
LIAM: Yeah.

2064
01:13:44.963 --> 01:13:47.018
MATT: Roll one more time?
ASHLEY: Warkäste?

2065
01:13:47.018 --> 01:13:50.440
SAM: Yeah, he's Shakäste's brother, Warkäste.

2066
01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:53.245
LIAM: 13 plus-- 20.
MATT: You're fine.

2067
01:13:53.245 --> 01:13:55.380
Just making sure that we were keeping track as we go.

2068
01:13:55.380 --> 01:13:56.871
All right, cool. Finishes with Caleb's go.

2069
01:13:56.871 --> 01:13:58.483
Jester, you're up, Fjord, you're on deck.

2070
01:13:58.483 --> 01:14:00.326
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to,

2071
01:14:01.970 --> 01:14:04.159
I'm going to Dimension Door.

2072
01:14:04.159 --> 01:14:05.460
SAM: (gasps) Oh.
MATT: Okay.

2073
01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:06.510
SAM: This is new.
LAURA: I'm going to

2074
01:14:06.510 --> 01:14:10.240
Dimension Door right here,

2075
01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:12.550
next to Caduceus.
SAM: Okay.

2076
01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:15.879
MATT: Boof, right next to him.
LAURA: And I'm going to say:

2077
01:14:15.879 --> 01:14:18.115
This is a signal!
TALIESIN: Got it.

2078
01:14:18.115 --> 01:14:19.237
(laughter)

2079
01:14:19.237 --> 01:14:21.385
MATT: All right, and you release Turn Undead.

2080
01:14:21.385 --> 01:14:23.350
TALIESIN: Turn Undead.
MATT: All righty.

2081
01:14:23.350 --> 01:14:25.590
TALIESIN: Which-- yeah.

2082
01:14:25.590 --> 01:14:26.423
MATT: Just checking--
TALIESIN: Depending on

2083
01:14:26.423 --> 01:14:27.720
what level they are at--
MATT: That's what I'm saying,

2084
01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:30.053
depending on the level here.

2085
01:14:31.675 --> 01:14:34.820
All right.
TALIESIN: Second or lower, I believe.

2086
01:14:34.820 --> 01:14:36.887
Yep, second or lower.
MATT: Okay.

2087
01:14:38.710 --> 01:14:39.840
Here we go.

2088
01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:41.370
That's everybody in that radius.

2089
01:14:41.370 --> 01:14:42.680
TALIESIN: Yep, 30 feet.

2090
01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:48.610
MATT: Oh, (laughs) 17.
TALIESIN: That one?

2091
01:14:48.610 --> 01:14:49.820
Oh, uh.
MATT: The DC in this is

2092
01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:51.170
17?
LAURA: Is 17?

2093
01:14:51.170 --> 01:14:53.531
TALIESIN: I believe it's 17.
MATT: Wow, he succeeds.

2094
01:14:53.531 --> 01:14:55.690
LAURA: Wow.
TALIESIN: I think,

2095
01:14:55.690 --> 01:14:56.523
it's my spell, it's my

2096
01:14:56.523 --> 01:14:57.570
spell DC, right?
MATT: Correct.

2097
01:14:57.570 --> 01:14:59.270
TALIESIN: Yeah, 17.
MATT: Pop.

2098
01:14:59.270 --> 01:15:00.250
SAM: Ooh!
LAURA: Yes.

2099
01:15:00.250 --> 01:15:01.806
MATT: Turns to--
SAM: Pop pop.

2100
01:15:01.806 --> 01:15:05.100
MATT: The poison splashes, then it turns to dust.

2101
01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:08.456
That one over there, same.
LAURA: Pop.

2102
01:15:08.456 --> 01:15:11.580
MATT: As Caduceus focuses and releases

2103
01:15:11.580 --> 01:15:15.100
this energy outward, as opposed to a shockwave blast,

2104
01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:16.800
the energy just all the sudden drifts up

2105
01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:20.360
off the ground like firelight sparkles lift,

2106
01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:22.900
and then bursts like a thousand tiny fireworks

2107
01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:24.780
across the way and as they come (popping)

2108
01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:26.560
around the undead, it goes around you guys

2109
01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:29.620
and it's just like this warm wave that passes by.

2110
01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:32.610
As it explodes near them, you watch it explode,

2111
01:15:32.610 --> 01:15:35.490
their body scatters outward and then turns to ash.

2112
01:15:35.490 --> 01:15:36.610
But the poison still splatters.

2113
01:15:36.610 --> 01:15:37.601
SAM: Ugh.
MATT: That one there?

2114
01:15:37.601 --> 01:15:39.581
LAURA: That's okay, they're all clumped together,

2115
01:15:39.581 --> 01:15:43.230
they're away from--
MATT: Fail! Psh.

2116
01:15:43.230 --> 01:15:44.063
That one.

2117
01:15:46.060 --> 01:15:47.742
Psh.
ASHLEY: Yes.

2118
01:15:49.450 --> 01:15:51.650
TALIESIN: Turn down for what?
SAM: Boop ba doop a doo.

2119
01:15:52.579 --> 01:15:56.446
MARISHA: Beau three-point lands in the rain pool and like--

2120
01:15:56.446 --> 01:15:58.263
TALIESIN: This is how it's done.
MARISHA: Music video moment.

2121
01:15:58.263 --> 01:16:00.160
TRAVIS: Tim Robbins in Shawshank.

2122
01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:01.590
MARISHA: Yes, yeah.
LAURA: Oh,

2123
01:16:01.590 --> 01:16:03.090
I was thinking like Tom Holland

2124
01:16:03.090 --> 01:16:04.354
dancing to Rihanna.
MARISHA: Tom Holland.

2125
01:16:04.354 --> 01:16:06.808
TALIESIN: Okay, sorry, you guys get--
MARISHA: On Fallon, yeah.

2126
01:16:06.808 --> 01:16:08.502
MATT: Yasha and Caleb, I need you to make another

2127
01:16:08.502 --> 01:16:09.860
constitution saving throw with advantage.

2128
01:16:09.860 --> 01:16:11.720
TALIESIN: Add a d4.
ASHLEY: Or like Step Up, Step Up 2,

2129
01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:13.650
or Step Up 3D where they did the dance in the rain.

2130
01:16:13.650 --> 01:16:15.100
MARISHA: Uh-huh.
LAURA: Step Up, Step Up 2--

2131
01:16:15.100 --> 01:16:17.740
MARISHA: Basically, any dance sequence with a rain pool.

2132
01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:21.039
TALIESIN: With advantage and a d4.

2133
01:16:21.039 --> 01:16:24.410
ASHLEY: Oh, same, okay, so.
TALIESIN: Jesus, you're fine.

2134
01:16:24.410 --> 01:16:26.520
ASHLEY: Oh yeah, okay.
TALIESIN: Oh lord, oh lord.

2135
01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:28.744
Just say the number out loud.

2136
01:16:28.744 --> 01:16:30.613
ASHLEY: (humming)

2137
01:16:30.613 --> 01:16:32.321
29.
MATT: Eight points of poison damage.

2138
01:16:32.321 --> 01:16:33.462
ASHLEY: Okay.
LIAM: 15.

2139
01:16:33.462 --> 01:16:36.000
MATT: 15. Eight points of poison damage.

2140
01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:37.240
All righty.

2141
01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:41.613
So one, one shmeasel skeleton left?

2142
01:16:41.613 --> 01:16:43.380
MATT: One skeleton left, or the,

2143
01:16:43.380 --> 01:16:47.110
the lasting husk zombie.

2144
01:16:47.110 --> 01:16:49.538
MATT: My Syrinscape crashed. That's okay.

2145
01:16:49.538 --> 01:16:50.779
That's okay, it's easy enough to get

2146
01:16:50.779 --> 01:16:53.806
back into battle stuff, you know how it goes.

2147
01:16:53.806 --> 01:16:57.143
All righty, that finishes.
TALIESIN and ASHLEY: Doo da doo ba doo.

2148
01:16:57.143 --> 01:16:58.628
MATT: Oh no, yeah, that was your action.

2149
01:16:58.628 --> 01:16:59.670
SAM: There's only one left?

2150
01:16:59.670 --> 01:17:01.730
MATT: There is one left at the moment.

2151
01:17:01.730 --> 01:17:02.910
LAURA: Can I--
TALIESIN: Turn Undead, man.

2152
01:17:02.910 --> 01:17:05.730
LAURA: For my bonus action--
MATT: Mm?

2153
01:17:05.730 --> 01:17:07.210
LAURA: For my bonus action--

2154
01:17:07.210 --> 01:17:09.159
LIAM: That's the cleric thing.
LAURA: Oh wait, no.

2155
01:17:09.159 --> 01:17:10.580
Nevermind.
TALIESIN: Because you did the spell.

2156
01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:11.766
LAURA: I did the spell, so--
TALIESIN: That was a good call, though.

2157
01:17:11.766 --> 01:17:13.720
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2158
01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:15.900
MATT: All right, that finishes your go.

2159
01:17:15.900 --> 01:17:18.020
Fjord.
TRAVIS: I'll rush over and take

2160
01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:20.630
the last remaining undead piece of shit,

2161
01:17:20.630 --> 01:17:22.750
two swings.
MATT: Go up for it.

2162
01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:26.640
TRAVIS: That's crap, 15.
MATT: 15 hits.

2163
01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:30.498
TRAVIS: All right. Second one is a 21.

2164
01:17:30.498 --> 01:17:31.340
MATT: Hits.

2165
01:17:31.340 --> 01:17:33.050
ASHLEY: Yes.
TRAVIS: All right, all right.

2166
01:17:34.460 --> 01:17:36.451
TRAVIS: It was high. 19.

2167
01:17:37.410 --> 01:17:39.940
21 points of slashing damage in the first one.

2168
01:17:39.940 --> 01:17:41.230
MATT: Nice.
TRAVIS: And

2169
01:17:42.150 --> 01:17:43.657
11 plus,

2170
01:17:45.130 --> 01:17:47.470
13 points of slashing damage on the second one.

2171
01:17:47.470 --> 01:17:48.550
MATT: You're adding the d4 to those?

2172
01:17:48.550 --> 01:17:49.800
TRAVIS: Yes.
MATT: For the attack

2173
01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:51.170
or the damage?
TRAVIS: For the damage.

2174
01:17:51.170 --> 01:17:52.710
MATT: They should be in it for the attack,

2175
01:17:52.710 --> 01:17:54.570
not the damage.
TRAVIS: Right, my fault.

2176
01:17:54.570 --> 01:17:56.970
So 11 points on the second one

2177
01:17:56.970 --> 01:17:59.694
and only 18 points on the first one.

2178
01:17:59.694 --> 01:18:01.077
MATT: You got it.

2179
01:18:01.077 --> 01:18:03.380
As you rush up, (footsteps, slicing)

2180
01:18:03.380 --> 01:18:04.985
strike once in the midsection

2181
01:18:04.985 --> 01:18:06.940
(groans) and that holds him in place,

2182
01:18:06.940 --> 01:18:08.780
like the impact caused its back to seize,

2183
01:18:08.780 --> 01:18:11.020
the second strike, carves back through its leg

2184
01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:12.550
and its leg folds and splinters,

2185
01:18:12.550 --> 01:18:14.968
the bone breaking in two pieces.

2186
01:18:14.968 --> 01:18:17.030
(squelching) The head (stretching)

2187
01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:18.510
bends backwards in an unhealthy way

2188
01:18:18.510 --> 01:18:20.310
and the tongue (growls) lolls open.

2189
01:18:20.310 --> 01:18:21.607
Still standing and it's real angry.

2190
01:18:21.607 --> 01:18:25.197
TRAVIS: I should have rolled those with advantage.
MARISHA: He's still standing?

2191
01:18:25.197 --> 01:18:26.277
LAURA: You didn't what?
TRAVIS: I didn't roll them

2192
01:18:26.277 --> 01:18:27.880
with advantage.
LAURA: You should roll to see if

2193
01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:30.340
you get a natural 20 on either of those.

2194
01:18:30.340 --> 01:18:31.370
LIAM: It's true.
TALIESIN: Yeah,

2195
01:18:31.370 --> 01:18:33.240
just do two more rolls.

2196
01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:35.700
LAURA: Two rolls to see if they're 20.

2197
01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:37.260
TRAVIS: Nope.
MATT: Okay, good to know.

2198
01:18:37.260 --> 01:18:40.060
All right, Yasha, you're up.

2199
01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:44.130
ASHLEY: Okay, well, I don't think I can get over there.

2200
01:18:44.130 --> 01:18:45.040
Can I get over there?

2201
01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:47.210
MATT: You can certainly try.
ASHLEY: I can try.

2202
01:18:47.210 --> 01:18:49.120
MARISHA: You can make it.

2203
01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:52.020
MATT: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25,

2204
01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:53.150
30,

2205
01:18:53.150 --> 01:18:54.170
35, 40.

2206
01:18:54.170 --> 01:18:55.785
Yeah, you can.
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.

2207
01:18:55.785 --> 01:19:00.018
All right, so I take a swing.

2208
01:19:01.266 --> 01:19:03.040
Big ol' swing,

2209
01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:06.273
that's cocked, that's cocked again.

2210
01:19:06.273 --> 01:19:07.394
Ooh.

2211
01:19:07.394 --> 01:19:08.940
Good thing I have advantage.

2212
01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:09.930
Oh wait.
MATT: You do not have

2213
01:19:09.930 --> 01:19:10.910
advantage anymore, unless you want--

2214
01:19:10.910 --> 01:19:12.820
ASHLEY: That was a natural one.
MATT: Oh.

2215
01:19:12.820 --> 01:19:14.029
Yeah, you did not call it--
ASHLEY: Unless I what?

2216
01:19:14.029 --> 01:19:17.050
MATT: You didn't call Reckless Attacks before--

2217
01:19:17.050 --> 01:19:18.490
ASHLEY: Oh yeah, no, no-no-no.
MATT: The first one misses.

2218
01:19:18.490 --> 01:19:21.600
You go forward and as you go to swing, your foot catches

2219
01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:24.640
one of the swamp roots and you almost fly into it.

2220
01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:26.750
You get your blade up in time before you stumble into

2221
01:19:26.750 --> 01:19:28.960
its flayed body and it manages to

2222
01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:30.890
block you with its weight.

2223
01:19:30.890 --> 01:19:32.170
As you catch yourself again,

2224
01:19:32.170 --> 01:19:34.060
its head, just partially pulled back,

2225
01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:35.990
is like (chomping) biting over

2226
01:19:35.990 --> 01:19:37.415
the edge of the blade as you retract

2227
01:19:37.415 --> 01:19:38.914
and get yourself in the right position.

2228
01:19:38.914 --> 01:19:40.110
Second attack.
ASHLEY: Okay.

2229
01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:42.800
TALIESIN: You have a d4 on that, too.
ASHLEY: I do?

2230
01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:44.050
Okay, let's see.

2231
01:19:46.207 --> 01:19:49.333
ASHLEY: I mean, if I don't mess up the rolls.

2232
01:19:49.333 --> 01:19:50.166
Okay.

2233
01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:53.830
19.
MATT: 19 damage or 19 to hit?

2234
01:19:53.830 --> 01:19:55.060
ASHLEY: 19 to hit.
MATT: 19 does hit,

2235
01:19:55.060 --> 01:19:58.090
go ahead and roll damage.

2236
01:19:58.090 --> 01:20:02.472
ASHLEY: Eight, nine, 16.

2237
01:20:02.472 --> 01:20:03.370
MATT: 16 points of damage.

2238
01:20:03.370 --> 01:20:05.703
ASHLEY: 16 points of damage.

2239
01:20:07.786 --> 01:20:10.970
MATT: You stab it with the
second strike and actually bisect it.

2240
01:20:10.970 --> 01:20:13.800
Its torso falls to the ground and the legs

2241
01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:15.500
crumple into place and you're waiting for it

2242
01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:16.890
to explode.
TRAVIS: Wait for it.

2243
01:20:16.890 --> 01:20:18.610
MATT: Instead, the legs get back up

2244
01:20:18.610 --> 01:20:21.500
and the torso climbs up onto its legs.

2245
01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:23.460
SAM: What, it's still alive?

2246
01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:25.130
MATT: It was the one that made its Undead Fortitude

2247
01:20:25.130 --> 01:20:27.020
save for this entire fucking fight.

2248
01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:28.695
MARISHA: Fucking die.

2249
01:20:28.695 --> 01:20:31.183
MATT: It remains at one hit point.
TRAVIS: Don't take it personally.

2250
01:20:31.183 --> 01:20:32.041
ASHLEY: (groaning)

2251
01:20:32.041 --> 01:20:32.949
MATT: All right.
ASHLEY: Okay.

2252
01:20:32.949 --> 01:20:36.560
MATT: That finishes your turn, I believe.

2253
01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:37.900
ASHLEY: Can I try, yeah.

2254
01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:38.860
I can't do anything else.
TRAVIS: I healed 14 points

2255
01:20:38.860 --> 01:20:40.320
because the Hexblade's Curse

2256
01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:41.200
target died.
MATT: Ooh, it did.

2257
01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:42.258
Call that.

2258
01:20:42.258 --> 01:20:43.845
You hear additional moans come rushing--

2259
01:20:43.845 --> 01:20:45.610
LAURA: No!
MARISHA: You are lying.

2260
01:20:46.710 --> 01:20:48.249
LAURA: We just, what do we do?

2261
01:20:48.249 --> 01:20:49.090
How do we get out of here?

2262
01:20:49.090 --> 01:20:50.032
MATT: From where you guys were over in the space,

2263
01:20:50.032 --> 01:20:52.640
these guys rush in here--

2264
01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:54.510
LAURA: They're just going to keep coming.

2265
01:20:54.510 --> 01:20:56.040
SAM: Should we run?
MATT: These two--

2266
01:20:56.040 --> 01:20:57.350
LAURA: I feel like that's the only--

2267
01:20:57.350 --> 01:20:59.520
LIAM: I'd have to start over.

2268
01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:00.640
MATT: This time,

2269
01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:02.410
as all of them have been falling and fighting,

2270
01:21:02.410 --> 01:21:04.050
these all rush forward and as they're

2271
01:21:04.050 --> 01:21:06.040
getting towards you, and they're rushing quickly,

2272
01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:07.270
as they're getting near your bodies,

2273
01:21:07.270 --> 01:21:08.482
you watch their bodies swell

2274
01:21:08.482 --> 01:21:11.830
(sucking) psh, pop pop pop.

2275
01:21:11.830 --> 01:21:14.440
They're not even going into combat, they're just--

2276
01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:16.060
LAURA: Exploding?
MATT: Detonating around you.

2277
01:21:16.060 --> 01:21:18.170
TALIESIN: If they were within 30 feet when I would've,

2278
01:21:18.170 --> 01:21:19.400
when it hit that, would that have been a--

2279
01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:21.470
MATT: They were out of the range and just rushed in

2280
01:21:21.470 --> 01:21:22.630
because you guys moved, you guys moved

2281
01:21:22.630 --> 01:21:24.840
to the outside that realm.

2282
01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:27.740
So I need Caduceus--
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

2283
01:21:27.740 --> 01:21:30.730
MATT: -- and Jester to go make-- this is going to be here.

2284
01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:33.660
Caduceus, you make two saving throws

2285
01:21:33.660 --> 01:21:35.400
for me.
TALIESIN: Okay.

2286
01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:36.450
They don't have advantage anymore.

2287
01:21:36.450 --> 01:21:37.490
MATT: No.
ASHLEY: No more advantage.

2288
01:21:37.490 --> 01:21:40.322
TALIESIN: Okay, that's all right, I got a d4.

2289
01:21:40.322 --> 01:21:41.155
Constitution saving throw?

2290
01:21:42.246 --> 01:21:44.030
25.

2291
01:21:44.030 --> 01:21:45.920
MATT: Okay, eight points of poison damage.

2292
01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:49.087
That's, and Jester, if you don't mind.

2293
01:21:54.450 --> 01:21:58.330
LAURA: 12.
MATT: Eight points of poison damage.

2294
01:21:58.330 --> 01:22:00.010
Second one against you, Caduceus.

2295
01:22:00.010 --> 01:22:01.210
Go ahead and roll again.

2296
01:22:02.206 --> 01:22:04.268
LAURA: It's going to add up real fast.
ASHLEY: Are we just going to keep going?

2297
01:22:04.268 --> 01:22:05.588
LAURA: Yeah.

2298
01:22:05.588 --> 01:22:07.920
TALIESIN: (sighs) 20.
MATT: 20?

2299
01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:09.590
Eight points of poison damage.

2300
01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:11.015
Jester.

2301
01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:14.265
LAURA: Mm, that's better.

2302
01:22:14.265 --> 01:22:15.798
I definitely saved.

2303
01:22:15.798 --> 01:22:19.270
MATT: Okay, that would be 10 points of poison damage.

2304
01:22:19.270 --> 01:22:21.310
And Caduceus?
TALIESIN: Oh, I was.

2305
01:22:21.310 --> 01:22:22.580
MATT: Oh no, you're on against the third one.

2306
01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:24.680
TALIESIN: I was doing a--
MATT: Sorry.

2307
01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:25.800
Jester, make another roll.
TALIESIN: I was rolling to maintain concentration.

2308
01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:27.300
LAURA: Another one?
MATT: You made two, right?

2309
01:22:27.300 --> 01:22:28.550
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: Sorry, then you're fine.

2310
01:22:28.550 --> 01:22:30.220
LAURA: Oh, I'm okay?

2311
01:22:30.220 --> 01:22:31.860
MATT: Those are all the ones you guys have to worry about.

2312
01:22:31.860 --> 01:22:34.450
TALIESIN: Then I rolled to maintain concentration and rolled

2313
01:22:34.450 --> 01:22:35.750
a 25.
MATT: Okay.

2314
01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:36.900
Good, good on you.

2315
01:22:37.810 --> 01:22:38.700
Nott.
SAM: Yeah.

2316
01:22:38.700 --> 01:22:39.940
MATT: Twice for me, if you don't mind.

2317
01:22:39.940 --> 01:22:42.271
SAM: Sure.

2318
01:22:42.271 --> 01:22:43.810
LAURA: Oh shit!
SAM: Do we have the advantage?

2319
01:22:43.810 --> 01:22:45.110
LAURA and MATT: No.

2320
01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:48.090
SAM: Then, one was a--
LAURA: You should just

2321
01:22:48.090 --> 01:22:50.290
roll again because they hit each other, it was a thing.

2322
01:22:50.290 --> 01:22:52.040
TALIESIN: And then, plus a d4.
LAURA: One was a 20, it shouldn't.

2323
01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:53.740
SAM: Well, now those are terrible.

2324
01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:56.160
Thanks, Laura.
LAURA: Oh sorry, well.

2325
01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:57.250
SAM: Doesn't matter.

2326
01:22:57.250 --> 01:23:00.070
It's single digits.
MATT: 14 points of poison damage.

2327
01:23:00.070 --> 01:23:01.520
LAURA: Sorry.
SAM: Cool.

2328
01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:02.970
Can I evade one of them?

2329
01:23:02.970 --> 01:23:05.150
MATT: Nope, it is not a dexterity-based.

2330
01:23:05.150 --> 01:23:08.030
Oh, doing your Uncanny Dodge, you mean?

2331
01:23:08.030 --> 01:23:08.863
SAM: Sure.
MATT: Evasion's only against

2332
01:23:08.863 --> 01:23:10.980
dexterity saving throws, unfortunately,

2333
01:23:10.980 --> 01:23:13.570
and Evade, I think, has to be in--

2334
01:23:13.570 --> 01:23:16.216
SAM: It's fine.
LIAM: They're both duds.

2335
01:23:16.216 --> 01:23:18.360
MATT: Well, Evade is against an attack.

2336
01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:20.720
This technically doesn't count
as an attack, so it's not an--

2337
01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:23.330
SAM: I'll just take it, it's fine.

2338
01:23:23.330 --> 01:23:25.090
MATT: Uncanny Dodge, it hits you with an attack,

2339
01:23:25.090 --> 01:23:27.200
so it is not a hit or attack, so you take,

2340
01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:31.672
for the second one, I totally forgot, actually.

2341
01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:38.150
Oof, 19 points of poison damage.

2342
01:23:38.150 --> 01:23:39.191
SAM: Ouchies.

2343
01:23:40.151 --> 01:23:42.020
MATT: (explosions)

2344
01:23:42.020 --> 01:23:46.030
MATT: The one that's currently between Yasha and Fjord

2345
01:23:46.030 --> 01:23:49.450
is going to strike twice, once at each of you.

2346
01:23:49.450 --> 01:23:50.680
ASHLEY: Okay.
MATT: Against you, Fjord.

2347
01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:53.550
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.
MATT: That's going to be a 14.

2348
01:23:53.550 --> 01:23:56.170
TRAVIS: It'll miss.
MATT: Yasha, that is a 16.

2349
01:23:56.170 --> 01:23:57.750
ASHLEY: No.
MATT: It strikes out

2350
01:23:57.750 --> 01:23:59.150
and both you guys just managed to push it away.

2351
01:23:59.150 --> 01:24:01.170
It's barely holding on, its body, its upper torso

2352
01:24:01.170 --> 01:24:03.340
runs or its upper torso just climbs up

2353
01:24:03.340 --> 01:24:05.590
its legs, leaps, and scrambles towards Yasha.

2354
01:24:05.590 --> 01:24:06.880
The legs just stand there on its own,

2355
01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:08.890
using its own body as a catapult.

2356
01:24:08.890 --> 01:24:10.930
You push it off onto Fjord and Fjord, you catch it

2357
01:24:10.930 --> 01:24:13.979
and like, "Ah!" You throw it back on the ground.

2358
01:24:13.979 --> 01:24:15.037
That's their turn.

2359
01:24:15.037 --> 01:24:17.850
TRAVIS: Have some dignity in death.
MATT: Nott, you're up.

2360
01:24:17.850 --> 01:24:20.094
SAM: I mean, are they going to keep coming?

2361
01:24:20.094 --> 01:24:20.927
Should we run?

2362
01:24:20.927 --> 01:24:21.935
MATT: Do you want to take your action to look around?

2363
01:24:21.935 --> 01:24:24.510
SAM: No, I'll shoot the one between Yasha and Fjord.

2364
01:24:24.510 --> 01:24:26.500
MATT: Go for it.
SAM: Just take it off the,

2365
01:24:26.500 --> 01:24:28.370
24.
MATT: That hits.

2366
01:24:28.370 --> 01:24:31.490
SAM: A million points of damage.
MATT: It, yeah.

2367
01:24:31.490 --> 01:24:33.423
We'll see if it makes its,

2368
01:24:33.423 --> 01:24:36.040
it does not make its Undead Fortitude save.

2369
01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:37.410
I need Yasha and Fjord to make

2370
01:24:37.410 --> 01:24:38.771
another constitution saving throw.

2371
01:24:38.771 --> 01:24:40.900
Without advantage.
TRAVIS: With advantage?

2372
01:24:40.900 --> 01:24:43.497
MATT: Without advantage.
TRAVIS: Without advantage.

2373
01:24:43.497 --> 01:24:44.955
TALIESIN: Let's stop killing--

2374
01:24:44.955 --> 01:24:46.780
TRAVIS: Hoo, 21.

2375
01:24:46.780 --> 01:24:47.800
LAURA: We need to run away.

2376
01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:49.200
TALIESIN: We also have to stop--
ASHLEY: 20 total.

2377
01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:50.280
TALIESIN: If they're next to people.

2378
01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:51.759
MATT: Seven points of poison damage to each of you.

2379
01:24:51.759 --> 01:24:54.065
ASHLEY: Okay.

2380
01:24:54.065 --> 01:24:55.120
MATT: Okay.

2381
01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:56.210
What're you guys doing?

2382
01:24:56.210 --> 01:24:58.820
TRAVIS: Fucking moving--
LAURA: We, how,

2383
01:24:58.820 --> 01:25:01.620
where do we go?

2384
01:25:01.620 --> 01:25:03.760
Keep moving through it or try to get back to the--

2385
01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:05.710
TALIESIN: I'm going to do a
Detect Undead really quickly again.

2386
01:25:05.710 --> 01:25:07.190
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: 60 feet.

2387
01:25:07.190 --> 01:25:08.023
MATT: 60 feet.

2388
01:25:08.023 --> 01:25:10.740
In that radius, you sense no other undead

2389
01:25:10.740 --> 01:25:11.940
in your immediate vicinity.

2390
01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:13.230
TALIESIN: So there's nothing in 60 feet.

2391
01:25:13.230 --> 01:25:14.978
MATT: Nothing yet.
MARISHA: Do this now?

2392
01:25:14.978 --> 01:25:16.220
LIAM: (grunting)

2393
01:25:16.220 --> 01:25:17.212
MARISHA: Do you want to build--

2394
01:25:17.212 --> 01:25:18.740
TALIESIN: That will last for a little while, so.

2395
01:25:18.740 --> 01:25:19.920
LAURA: Oh, that will last for awhile?

2396
01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:21.010
TALIESIN: There's nothing around us right now.

2397
01:25:21.010 --> 01:25:23.090
MATT: It lasts for how long?
TALIESIN: Let me tell you.

2398
01:25:23.090 --> 01:25:24.620
ASHLEY: How many points of damage did we just take?

2399
01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:26.110
TRAVIS: Seven.
ASHLEY: Seven, okay.

2400
01:25:26.110 --> 01:25:27.310
LAURA: Turn Undead lasts for a minute.

2401
01:25:27.310 --> 01:25:29.900
TALIESIN: This is, oh awesome, Turn Undead is also still up.

2402
01:25:29.900 --> 01:25:31.250
MATT: Is Turn Undead concentration, though?

2403
01:25:31.250 --> 01:25:33.360
TALIESIN: Uh, no.
LAURA: No.

2404
01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:34.710
TALIESIN: Hold on, I'm looking.

2405
01:25:36.130 --> 01:25:38.640
Eyes of the Grave is until the end of my next turn.

2406
01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:40.740
MATT: Okay, so it stays up for the next round.

2407
01:25:41.940 --> 01:25:43.840
TALIESIN: Then second, if anything comes

2408
01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:45.780
within the next round, I get an instant warning.

2409
01:25:45.780 --> 01:25:46.870
Turn Undead is--
LAURA: It doesn't

2410
01:25:46.870 --> 01:25:48.610
say anything about concentration on here-

2411
01:25:48.610 --> 01:25:51.390
MATT: No, I don't think Turn Undead is--

2412
01:25:51.390 --> 01:25:52.765
TALIESIN: Concentration.

2413
01:25:54.031 --> 01:25:54.972
MATT: No, it is turned for one minute,

2414
01:25:54.972 --> 01:25:56.220
it doesn't last for a minute, meaning if

2415
01:25:56.220 --> 01:25:58.478
they're turned, they are. That's what I thought.

2416
01:25:58.478 --> 01:26:00.108
It's an instant move and it can,

2417
01:26:00.108 --> 01:26:01.160
the fear that you put in them

2418
01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:02.510
can last a minute.
LAURA: Okay.

2419
01:26:03.610 --> 01:26:05.730
SAM: Does that mean you can't detect things right now?

2420
01:26:05.730 --> 01:26:07.870
TALIESIN: There is nothing--
MATT: Immediately around you.

2421
01:26:07.870 --> 01:26:10.300
TALIESIN: Immediately around us.
MATT: What are you guys doing?

2422
01:26:10.300 --> 01:26:13.060
You're all covered in gunk, your body is--

2423
01:26:13.060 --> 01:26:14.950
LAURA: We should heal.
MATT: -- burning from the poison

2424
01:26:14.950 --> 01:26:16.950
that's now seeped into the outside of your

2425
01:26:16.950 --> 01:26:19.801
exposed flesh and begun to found its way into your armor.

2426
01:26:19.801 --> 01:26:22.195
TALIESIN: Be better to save mass heals
for when someone goes down

2427
01:26:22.195 --> 01:26:26.707
so it gets them up and heals everybody, I think.

2428
01:26:26.707 --> 01:26:28.000
LAURA: What?
TRAVIS: It's quiet, we're here.

2429
01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:29.840
Should we just try and put the hut back up?

2430
01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:31.110
If something comes, we run.

2431
01:26:31.110 --> 01:26:32.677
SAM: Capeleb is--
MARISHA: 11 minutes

2432
01:26:32.677 --> 01:26:35.460
and then the other half of us stand watch.

2433
01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:40.710
Apeleb, Capeleb?
LAURA: They're not going to

2434
01:26:40.710 --> 01:26:43.160
stay away for 11 minutes, but--

2435
01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:46.250
TALIESIN: I am keeping a very sharp eye out for anything.

2436
01:26:46.250 --> 01:26:47.930
SAM: We should just keep going.
TRAVIS: All right.

2437
01:26:47.930 --> 01:26:49.050
Let's keep going.
MATT: Up to you guys.

2438
01:26:49.050 --> 01:26:50.080
You guys are still going?

2439
01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:51.050
LAURA: Try to get out of the mist.

2440
01:26:51.050 --> 01:26:53.410
Did the mist cover the whole forest?

2441
01:26:53.410 --> 01:26:55.540
MATT: Yes.
LAURA: We don't know.

2442
01:26:55.540 --> 01:26:57.440
MATT: Since you began to enter the forest,

2443
01:26:57.440 --> 01:26:59.420
the mist was slowly hanging around

2444
01:26:59.420 --> 01:27:02.120
the hut anyway, the house, it's just been getting thicker

2445
01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:04.735
as the night progresses and the temperature drops.

2446
01:27:04.735 --> 01:27:05.568
LAURA: We got to hut it.

2447
01:27:05.568 --> 01:27:07.540
There's no escaping it.

2448
01:27:07.540 --> 01:27:09.860
SAM: Well, we just keep walking through the night, no?

2449
01:27:09.860 --> 01:27:11.370
TALIESIN: With exhaustion already?

2450
01:27:11.370 --> 01:27:13.160
I think we're just going to make more noise.

2451
01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:14.680
TRAVIS: We should chance it for the 10 minutes for the hut.

2452
01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:16.620
TALIESIN: Let's do 10 minutes.
SAM: Okay.

2453
01:27:16.620 --> 01:27:20.070
I'll jump up and down and start signaling to Caleb.

2454
01:27:20.070 --> 01:27:22.030
LAURA: And I'm going to keep Turn Undead prepped for,

2455
01:27:22.030 --> 01:27:23.990
if anything comes near us, I'm going to immediately

2456
01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:25.817
cast Turn Undead.
MATT: Okay.

2457
01:27:25.817 --> 01:27:29.050
TALIESIN: If I see a feather move in the forest,

2458
01:27:29.050 --> 01:27:30.600
I'm going to immediately do Detect.

2459
01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:32.920
SAM: Magic.
MATT: Okay, you got it.

2460
01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:35.410
You guys--
MARISHA: You, smart person.

2461
01:27:35.410 --> 01:27:37.230
LIAM: Gorilla goes (shrinking).

2462
01:27:37.230 --> 01:27:39.930
You know, I can understand everything that you're saying.

2463
01:27:39.930 --> 01:27:42.510
MARISHA: Oh, we didn't have to talk to you like idiots?

2464
01:27:42.510 --> 01:27:43.590
LIAM: No.
MARISHA: Oh.

2465
01:27:43.590 --> 01:27:45.200
MATT: Okay, so--
MARISHA: You should have told us that.

2466
01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:47.010
TALIESIN: Shh.
MATT: You go back to

2467
01:27:47.010 --> 01:27:48.320
that little patch of land you had

2468
01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:49.610
situated in the middle of this battle

2469
01:27:49.610 --> 01:27:51.890
and you begin the 10 minute process

2470
01:27:51.890 --> 01:27:54.550
of preparing this ritual a second time.

2471
01:27:54.550 --> 01:27:56.660
Who, I would say all of you guys,

2472
01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:00.630
everyone make a stealth check.

2473
01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:04.550
LAURA: Oh, it's that fucking trunk probably attracted--

2474
01:28:04.550 --> 01:28:07.570
MATT: The trunk sound is what you think attracted them.

2475
01:28:07.570 --> 01:28:08.780
They weren't drawn to you

2476
01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:11.940
until they heard the loud crack and the splash in the water.

2477
01:28:11.940 --> 01:28:15.072
LAURA: Oh, I'm getting myself a d4 as well.

2478
01:28:15.072 --> 01:28:16.272
MARISHA: 21.

2479
01:28:16.272 --> 01:28:18.660
TRAVIS: Eight.
LIAM: 15.

2480
01:28:18.660 --> 01:28:20.100
SAM: 29.

2481
01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:20.933
LAURA: 19.

2482
01:28:21.790 --> 01:28:22.870
TALIESIN: 18.
ASHLEY: Nine.

2483
01:28:22.870 --> 01:28:24.690
SAM: Wait, these are--
TRAVIS: Stealth.

2484
01:28:24.690 --> 01:28:26.520
SAM: At disadvantage.
TALIESIN: At disadvantage for--

2485
01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:27.442
MATT: Yes.

2486
01:28:27.442 --> 01:28:28.672
LAURA: Oh, against anyone that's exhausted.

2487
01:28:28.672 --> 01:28:30.970
MATT: For anybody who has exhaustion.

2488
01:28:30.970 --> 01:28:33.587
TRAVIS: Eight still.
SAM: And mine is a natural one.

2489
01:28:35.060 --> 01:28:36.221
MATT: Oh, your first one was a natural one?

2490
01:28:36.221 --> 01:28:38.146
SAM: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

2491
01:28:38.146 --> 01:28:40.740
Did you have a point of exhaustion from last game?

2492
01:28:40.740 --> 01:28:41.670
ASHLEY: I don't think I do.

2493
01:28:41.670 --> 01:28:43.572
LAURA: No, you weren't exhausted.
MATT: Okay.

2494
01:28:43.572 --> 01:28:46.822
SAM: But I do have Reliable Talent?
ASHLEY: It does say

2495
01:28:46.822 --> 01:28:48.560
condition is exhaustion.
MATT: Oh, you do.

2496
01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:49.910
So yeah, so you roll again.

2497
01:28:49.910 --> 01:28:51.770
So yeah, that would be a 10 plus whatever

2498
01:28:51.770 --> 01:28:53.210
bonus you have.
SAM: 23.

2499
01:28:53.210 --> 01:28:54.940
MATT: 23.
ASHLEY: It's still nine.

2500
01:28:54.940 --> 01:28:55.773
TALIESIN: Yeah.

2501
01:28:56.955 --> 01:28:59.410
MARISHA: Yeah, um.

2502
01:28:59.410 --> 01:29:01.250
What're these, stealth?

2503
01:29:01.250 --> 01:29:02.600
MATT: So what is it?
ASHLEY: Nine still.

2504
01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:04.325
MATT: Nine still?
MARISHA: 17.

2505
01:29:04.325 --> 01:29:05.666
MATT: 17, okay.

2506
01:29:06.870 --> 01:29:10.180
You guys begin guarding the space and keeping

2507
01:29:10.180 --> 01:29:13.410
a look out, you two in particular being ready and watchful.

2508
01:29:13.410 --> 01:29:15.831
About five or so minutes into this casting,

2509
01:29:15.831 --> 01:29:17.870
you begin to see a few more shapes

2510
01:29:17.870 --> 01:29:19.570
emerging from the mist,

2511
01:29:19.570 --> 01:29:22.570
seemingly still drawn from the nearby sound of battle.

2512
01:29:22.570 --> 01:29:24.860
They look a little confused, meaning that

2513
01:29:24.860 --> 01:29:26.390
they're not coming directly, bee-lining at you,

2514
01:29:26.390 --> 01:29:29.980
but the sounds of combat that recently happened here,

2515
01:29:29.980 --> 01:29:31.530
they've been moving in that direction

2516
01:29:31.530 --> 01:29:33.470
and you guys haven't moved away from your position,

2517
01:29:33.470 --> 01:29:35.720
so they're just now catching up to you.

2518
01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:37.910
They're about, I'd say at this point,

2519
01:29:37.910 --> 01:29:40.247
you can clock them at about 50 feet from you.

2520
01:29:40.247 --> 01:29:44.245
TRAVIS: I will cast Major Image

2521
01:29:44.245 --> 01:29:49.245
and put a giant, thrashing young blue dragon

2522
01:29:49.260 --> 01:29:53.350
120 feet in that direction.
MATT: Okay.

2523
01:29:53.350 --> 01:29:55.010
As you guys see this and you're beginning to prep yourself,

2524
01:29:55.010 --> 01:29:58.870
all of a sudden you hear this (roars),

2525
01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:01.090
the cracking and breaking of trees.

2526
01:30:01.090 --> 01:30:05.840
You glance over and you see a fucking young blue dragon

2527
01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:08.920
just land in the middle of this swamp and begin growling,

2528
01:30:08.920 --> 01:30:11.290
its mouth crackling with electrical energy.

2529
01:30:11.290 --> 01:30:13.100
And you watch as these undead,

2530
01:30:13.100 --> 01:30:15.291
immediately their heads turn (growls)

2531
01:30:15.291 --> 01:30:16.300
and begin running in that direction.

2532
01:30:16.300 --> 01:30:18.122
LAURA: He's back, he's back.

2533
01:30:18.122 --> 01:30:18.955
TRAVIS: No--
LAURA: He's back to--

2534
01:30:18.955 --> 01:30:20.248
TRAVIS: It's me, it's me, I did, I did it,

2535
01:30:20.248 --> 01:30:23.670
I did, (rolls tongue) that's me.

2536
01:30:23.670 --> 01:30:24.759
MATT: How long can that last?

2537
01:30:24.759 --> 01:30:26.653
(laughter)

2538
01:30:26.653 --> 01:30:28.336
ASHLEY: That's amazing!
TRAVIS: 10 minutes.

2539
01:30:28.336 --> 01:30:29.252
MATT: 10 minutes.

2540
01:30:29.252 --> 01:30:31.078
TRAVIS: Ah.
MATT: Okay.

2541
01:30:31.078 --> 01:30:33.210
You, then, sit there and wait and watch

2542
01:30:33.210 --> 01:30:36.817
as the loud noise that that Major Image is creating,

2543
01:30:38.010 --> 01:30:38.843
two more,

2544
01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:41.930
six more,

2545
01:30:41.930 --> 01:30:43.255
a dozen more,

2546
01:30:44.310 --> 01:30:46.240
you eventually, probably, in the period of time

2547
01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:47.480
it takes for you to finish this ritual,

2548
01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:51.090
watch somewhere between 40 to 50 more of these undead

2549
01:30:51.090 --> 01:30:52.970
come out of the mists from different places,

2550
01:30:52.970 --> 01:30:54.660
the shadows just rushing through,

2551
01:30:54.660 --> 01:30:58.950
once again at a sprinting speed for a zombie-like creature

2552
01:30:58.950 --> 01:31:00.750
in the direction of this dragon,

2553
01:31:00.750 --> 01:31:02.260
as thrashing around as they're just

2554
01:31:02.260 --> 01:31:04.980
walking in and out of its space, not intelligent enough

2555
01:31:04.980 --> 01:31:06.700
to really discern that it's an illusion and just

2556
01:31:06.700 --> 01:31:08.780
confused and frustrated that it's not having any effect.

2557
01:31:08.780 --> 01:31:10.490
Some of them are popping and exploding

2558
01:31:10.490 --> 01:31:12.440
in the hopes of taking this down,

2559
01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:13.940
this thing that doesn't exist.

2560
01:31:15.510 --> 01:31:18.480
But it's a large, large group of them now.

2561
01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:21.210
Probably about 30 or so are just there, nestled around

2562
01:31:21.210 --> 01:31:24.120
this dragon illusion.

2563
01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:26.820
As you finish creating the dome. (poofing)

2564
01:31:26.820 --> 01:31:29.870
LIAM: It is a green and brown mottled color

2565
01:31:29.870 --> 01:31:32.210
and it is less moist inside than out,

2566
01:31:32.210 --> 01:31:35.006
except for the ground.
MATT: Okay.

2567
01:31:35.006 --> 01:31:36.790
You guys all step inside?
LAURA: Yeah.

2568
01:31:36.790 --> 01:31:39.370
TRAVIS: I will drop it and step inside.

2569
01:31:39.370 --> 01:31:41.728
LAURA: Drop it?!
MATT: Okay.

2570
01:31:41.728 --> 01:31:42.561
LAURA: They're all going to

2571
01:31:42.561 --> 01:31:44.671
just come out and, like--
MARISHA: Yeah, they're

2572
01:31:44.671 --> 01:31:45.604
just going to pound this.
TALIESIN: Well, here's the thing.

2573
01:31:45.604 --> 01:31:47.696
We're going to give it some time.
LAURA: Well, they're not going to see us,

2574
01:31:47.696 --> 01:31:48.529
they can't hear us.

2575
01:31:48.529 --> 01:31:51.181
TALIESIN: If they come back, we can just Turn Undead

2576
01:31:51.181 --> 01:31:52.287
and just keep Turning Undead until

2577
01:31:52.287 --> 01:31:53.962
they all go away.

2578
01:31:53.962 --> 01:31:55.600
LAURA: Okay.

2579
01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:58.318
TALIESIN: I can still do that, you can still do that.

2580
01:31:58.318 --> 01:31:59.790
We'll be fine.

2581
01:31:59.790 --> 01:32:03.660
I don't think the group will get through the thing.

2582
01:32:03.660 --> 01:32:05.310
LAURA: And they can hear through the--

2583
01:32:06.290 --> 01:32:07.160
LIAM: Yeah.
LAURA: Dome?

2584
01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:08.630
Okay.
TRAVIS: Yeah, so we should just be

2585
01:32:08.630 --> 01:32:11.160
quiet as possible for awhile.

2586
01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:14.120
LIAM: Caleb is picking little
insects out of the damaged tree

2587
01:32:14.120 --> 01:32:16.570
that was pulled up and is just feeding them to Frumpkin.

2588
01:32:16.570 --> 01:32:19.770
MATT: There's plenty.
LAURA: Oh, I take after and I start

2589
01:32:19.770 --> 01:32:22.002
doing that for Sprinkle, too.
MATT: Okay.

2590
01:32:22.002 --> 01:32:23.890
You stop yourself a couple times

2591
01:32:23.890 --> 01:32:25.210
before feeding it to Sprinkle because

2592
01:32:25.210 --> 01:32:29.000
the toxic poison that was thrown all around this area

2593
01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:29.892
where you guys are planning to sleep--

2594
01:32:29.892 --> 01:32:31.691
TRAVIS: No no, she gives it to Sprinkle.

2595
01:32:31.691 --> 01:32:33.452
(laughter)

2596
01:32:33.452 --> 01:32:34.767
LIAM: Go to sleep, go to sleep.

2597
01:32:34.767 --> 01:32:36.590
(laughter)

2598
01:32:36.590 --> 01:32:38.097
MATT: Shh, shh.

2599
01:32:38.097 --> 01:32:40.090
(laughter)

2600
01:32:40.090 --> 01:32:41.781
TRAVIS: (as Sprinkle) I welcome it.

2601
01:32:41.781 --> 01:32:43.489
TALIESIN: Just to help everybody heal overnight,

2602
01:32:43.489 --> 01:32:44.750
I'm going to take a few minutes to do

2603
01:32:44.750 --> 01:32:47.520
a Prayer of Healing.
MATT: Okay.

2604
01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:51.585
LAURA: We all are very, very, very quiet until, you know,

2605
01:32:51.585 --> 01:32:54.910
hopefully the zombies start to, like (popping).

2606
01:32:54.910 --> 01:32:55.743
MATT: Yep.

2607
01:32:55.743 --> 01:32:57.390
As you all get quiet and rest

2608
01:32:57.390 --> 01:32:59.940
and begin setting up your space here and you're doing what?

2609
01:32:59.940 --> 01:33:02.640
TALIESIN: A Prayer of Healing for
25 hit points to everybody.

2610
01:33:02.640 --> 01:33:03.473
MATT: How long does it take to cast?

2611
01:33:03.473 --> 01:33:04.970
TALIESIN: 10 minutes.

2612
01:33:04.970 --> 01:33:05.803
MATT: 10 minutes?

2613
01:33:05.803 --> 01:33:07.240
Okay.
ASHLEY: 25 points, okay.

2614
01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:09.720
MATT: So the illusion drops before you finish

2615
01:33:09.720 --> 01:33:11.180
casting your prayer.
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.

2616
01:33:11.180 --> 01:33:12.317
MARISHA: (sneezing)
LIAM: <i>Gesundheit</i>.

2617
01:33:12.317 --> 01:33:15.058
MATT: As you're quietly muttering the incantation,

2618
01:33:15.058 --> 01:33:16.400
I would like you to make a--

2619
01:33:17.413 --> 01:33:18.246
MARISHA: (sneezing)

2620
01:33:18.246 --> 01:33:19.079
MATT: Bless you.

2621
01:33:19.079 --> 01:33:21.153
Just a general stealth check for me.

2622
01:33:21.153 --> 01:33:22.482
TALIESIN: All right.

2623
01:33:22.482 --> 01:33:24.827
(chuckling)

2624
01:33:24.827 --> 01:33:26.018
LAURA: I don't think I can do that.

2625
01:33:26.018 --> 01:33:28.675
Can I guide him in this moment?

2626
01:33:31.930 --> 01:33:33.130
LAURA: I feel like--
MATT: You can

2627
01:33:33.130 --> 01:33:35.590
Blessing of the Trickster with him, if you want to.

2628
01:33:35.590 --> 01:33:37.500
TALIESIN: What does that give me?
LAURA: Advantage.

2629
01:33:37.500 --> 01:33:39.250
TALIESIN: Oh, so it's just a straight roll,

2630
01:33:39.250 --> 01:33:40.910
I don't have disadvantage.

2631
01:33:40.910 --> 01:33:42.910
That's cool, that helps.

2632
01:33:45.060 --> 01:33:47.390
16.
MATT: 16, okay.

2633
01:33:47.390 --> 01:33:49.130
You manage to speak the incantation

2634
01:33:49.130 --> 01:33:52.610
loud enough that it manages to maintain the spell,

2635
01:33:52.610 --> 01:33:54.722
but not enough to draw the attention.

2636
01:33:54.722 --> 01:33:56.450
In that little bit of crossover time,

2637
01:33:56.450 --> 01:33:58.100
you watch the dragon that's just

2638
01:33:58.100 --> 01:33:59.780
thrashing and growling and making noise

2639
01:33:59.780 --> 01:34:04.097
in the middle of the swamp here suddenly (pops) vanish.

2640
01:34:05.588 --> 01:34:06.504
And right as you're getting towards

2641
01:34:06.504 --> 01:34:07.726
the end of your spell, you begin to see

2642
01:34:07.726 --> 01:34:08.950
some of the shapes wandering

2643
01:34:08.950 --> 01:34:10.950
from where that cluster of zombies were.

2644
01:34:12.890 --> 01:34:15.640
Right as you finish the healing effect, it flashes,

2645
01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:17.300
and it heals you all for how much?

2646
01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:18.520
TALIESIN: Everybody for 25 hit points.

2647
01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:21.830
MATT: 25 hit points to all of you.
TRAVIS: Thank you, sir.

2648
01:34:21.830 --> 01:34:23.613
I say quietly.

2649
01:34:23.613 --> 01:34:26.150
MATT: (laughs) But the light does not emerge because

2650
01:34:26.150 --> 01:34:29.670
the dome manages to remain obfuscating the interior.

2651
01:34:29.670 --> 01:34:31.950
But you all watch quietly and tensely as,

2652
01:34:31.950 --> 01:34:34.850
over the next hour or so, they just

2653
01:34:34.850 --> 01:34:37.540
begin to scatter out a bit.

2654
01:34:37.540 --> 01:34:39.620
And others that you didn't notice

2655
01:34:39.620 --> 01:34:41.640
walk through the mist behind you.

2656
01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:44.946
Night here is a very dangerous thing.

2657
01:34:44.946 --> 01:34:46.930
TRAVIS: Wow.
MATT: At least in

2658
01:34:46.930 --> 01:34:48.630
this particular part of the swamp.

2659
01:34:49.761 --> 01:34:52.580
SAM: What did this place used to be?

2660
01:34:52.580 --> 01:34:54.780
Why are there so many dead people here?

2661
01:34:54.780 --> 01:34:56.354
LAURA: We're whispering all of this.

2662
01:34:56.354 --> 01:34:58.310
Nothing above a teeny, tiny whisper.

2663
01:34:58.310 --> 01:34:59.520
MATT: Both of you guys can make history checks

2664
01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:00.620
if you want to.
MARISHA: Would I know?

2665
01:35:00.620 --> 01:35:01.805
MATT: You might, make a history check.

2666
01:35:01.805 --> 01:35:03.098
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MARISHA: Okay.

2667
01:35:03.098 --> 01:35:04.130
MATT: The two Empire kids might.

2668
01:35:04.130 --> 01:35:07.622
MARISHA: Would I know being close, nearby, raised here?

2669
01:35:07.622 --> 01:35:09.683
MATT: That's what this roll's for.

2670
01:35:09.683 --> 01:35:11.300
MARISHA: Oh wait, I don't have advantage.

2671
01:35:11.300 --> 01:35:12.808
SAM: Nope.
MATT: I'll say because you lived here,

2672
01:35:12.808 --> 01:35:13.691
close to here, sure.

2673
01:35:13.691 --> 01:35:15.240
Roll advantage.
MARISHA: They were both,

2674
01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:16.590
but I'm also exhausted, so I'll take

2675
01:35:16.590 --> 01:35:18.930
the lower of the two, which is 15.

2676
01:35:18.930 --> 01:35:20.470
MATT: 15, okay.
LIAM: 18.

2677
01:35:20.470 --> 01:35:22.270
MARISHA: Wait, 15 is what I rolled.

2678
01:35:22.270 --> 01:35:24.170
With a history check, it's--

2679
01:35:24.170 --> 01:35:26.050
LIAM: 7,000.
MARISHA: 23.

2680
01:35:26.050 --> 01:35:27.220
MATT: 23, okay.
LAURA: Ooh.

2681
01:35:28.950 --> 01:35:30.530
MATT: During the time of the Julous Dominion--

2682
01:35:30.530 --> 01:35:32.170
LAURA: Beau knows.
MATT: During the time

2683
01:35:32.170 --> 01:35:34.070
of the Julous Dominion, before the Dwendalian Empire

2684
01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:37.240
and the Julous Dominion had their fight,

2685
01:35:37.240 --> 01:35:39.190
there were certain sects of people

2686
01:35:39.190 --> 01:35:41.540
that lived in what is now the Truscan Vale

2687
01:35:41.540 --> 01:35:44.620
and around these mountains that had built

2688
01:35:44.620 --> 01:35:47.972
an entire colony based around this,

2689
01:35:49.210 --> 01:35:51.560
what they proclaimed to be a god-like creature

2690
01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:53.060
that existed in this mountain.

2691
01:35:54.250 --> 01:35:56.940
They referred to it as the Twilight Phoenix

2692
01:35:56.940 --> 01:36:00.390
and they would burn effigies to it.

2693
01:36:00.390 --> 01:36:02.170
They have this longstanding belief that

2694
01:36:02.170 --> 01:36:03.970
this mountain was its home

2695
01:36:03.970 --> 01:36:07.303
or its what it became when it eventually laid to rest.

2696
01:36:07.303 --> 01:36:09.080
And that's why they explain all the geothermal activity

2697
01:36:09.080 --> 01:36:12.433
around here they say is just a remnant of it.

2698
01:36:12.433 --> 01:36:15.483
TRAVIS: We did see a purple firebird down in that

2699
01:36:15.483 --> 01:36:18.150
temple of Uk'otoa.
SAM: (whispering) Uk'otoa.

2700
01:36:18.150 --> 01:36:20.440
MATT: But the people that worshiped this--

2701
01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:25.367
The people that worshiped this entity around this area

2702
01:36:27.060 --> 01:36:30.220
also made a lot of enemies and the Julous Dominion,

2703
01:36:30.220 --> 01:36:33.440
though they were within its terrain, at some point,

2704
01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:37.750
they were hunted down and killed in their homeland,

2705
01:36:37.750 --> 01:36:42.542
pretty much just wiped out around the base of Mount Mentiri.

2706
01:36:44.060 --> 01:36:45.670
LAURA: I have a question.
TRAVIS: Yes.

2707
01:36:46.930 --> 01:36:49.320
LAURA: When you were seeing that vision of Uk'otoa.

2708
01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:50.450
ALL: (whispering) Uk'otoa.

2709
01:36:50.450 --> 01:36:54.340
LAURA: And he showed you something
in the mountains or something,

2710
01:36:54.340 --> 01:36:56.380
like, a location, are we near that?

2711
01:36:56.380 --> 01:36:57.360
TRAVIS: No.
LAURA: Would you know?

2712
01:36:57.360 --> 01:36:58.520
TRAVIS: Yes.
LAURA: Okay.

2713
01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:02.090
TRAVIS: No, it's more, it's closer to the Menagerie Coast

2714
01:37:02.090 --> 01:37:04.220
and east and inland just a little bit,

2715
01:37:04.220 --> 01:37:05.450
before you get to the gate that

2716
01:37:05.450 --> 01:37:07.992
leads to the Empire, if I remember correctly.

2717
01:37:07.992 --> 01:37:09.660
MATT: You are correct.
LAURA: Okay.

2718
01:37:09.660 --> 01:37:13.468
TRAVIS: <i>I</i> remembered correctly?
MATT: You did, Mr. Stone!

2719
01:37:13.468 --> 01:37:14.784
TALIESIN: What?

2720
01:37:14.784 --> 01:37:16.383
Right.
LIAM: Ice cold.

2721
01:37:16.383 --> 01:37:17.216
TALIESIN: What?

2722
01:37:18.249 --> 01:37:19.299
Uh.

2723
01:37:19.299 --> 01:37:21.370
MATT: You--
MARISHA: What.

2724
01:37:21.370 --> 01:37:23.011
TALIESIN: Right.

2725
01:37:23.011 --> 01:37:24.851
MATT: Uh.

2726
01:37:24.851 --> 01:37:27.549
LIAM: Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch.

2727
01:37:27.549 --> 01:37:29.838
MATT: It's always a good D&amp;D game when Peaches comes up.

2728
01:37:29.838 --> 01:37:31.884
MARISHA: -- callin' me. All the time.

2729
01:37:31.884 --> 01:37:32.991
TALIESIN: Ignore all that.
MATT: So--

2730
01:37:32.991 --> 01:37:34.332
LIAM: Fuck your mountain and your phoenix.

2731
01:37:34.332 --> 01:37:36.160
MATT: Yeah, I know. Lore?

2732
01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:37.856
TALIESIN: Lore.
MATT: Peaches.

2733
01:37:37.856 --> 01:37:39.698
(laughter)

2734
01:37:39.698 --> 01:37:40.962
MATT: I'm not complaining.
TRAVIS: It's true, right?

2735
01:37:40.962 --> 01:37:43.530
We saw tapestries in that temple.

2736
01:37:43.530 --> 01:37:45.980
One was a purple--
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2737
01:37:47.354 --> 01:37:49.020
MARISHA: Does that sound about right?
SAM: A steel trap your memory is!

2738
01:37:49.020 --> 01:37:53.653
MARISHA: Is there a roll to see if that sounds relatable?

2739
01:37:54.723 --> 01:37:56.540
Can I roll for relatability?

2740
01:37:56.540 --> 01:37:58.570
MATT: No, your history check was, you don't have

2741
01:37:58.570 --> 01:37:59.850
anything that directly connects to those two,

2742
01:37:59.850 --> 01:38:01.370
but there was a mention of phoenix

2743
01:38:01.370 --> 01:38:04.513
and this was a historical phoenix in this region.

2744
01:38:04.513 --> 01:38:05.354
If it even existed.

2745
01:38:05.354 --> 01:38:07.315
Like I said, there were a lot of entities

2746
01:38:07.315 --> 01:38:10.500
that were worshiped that were just landmarks,

2747
01:38:10.500 --> 01:38:12.133
that were just, you know,

2748
01:38:13.518 --> 01:38:17.640
giving a persona and a divine essence

2749
01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:20.990
to what is essentially a landmass or a natural phenomenon.

2750
01:38:20.990 --> 01:38:23.115
This is not an uncommon thing.

2751
01:38:23.970 --> 01:38:26.243
But it could be, who knows?

2752
01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:29.020
MARISHA: Especially, then, if the worshipers

2753
01:38:29.020 --> 01:38:31.770
were hunted down and eradicated.

2754
01:38:31.770 --> 01:38:34.550
TRAVIS: Yeah, I mean, if you really want to get crazy,

2755
01:38:34.550 --> 01:38:36.642
Uk'otoa had three temples,

2756
01:38:36.642 --> 01:38:39.988
then I'm sure the other two entities might also have--

2757
01:38:39.988 --> 01:38:43.080
MARISHA: Three temples.
TRAVIS: Right.

2758
01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:44.313
Don't know if there were, you know,

2759
01:38:44.313 --> 01:38:46.977
forgotten to time temples around here, do you?

2760
01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:50.212
MARISHA: Well, I know that this was also

2761
01:38:50.212 --> 01:38:53.200
a big battleground of the pre-Calamity--

2762
01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:55.516
SAM: She's whispering, that's how she whispers.

2763
01:38:55.516 --> 01:38:58.120
MARISHA: I'm whispering, yeah, very, yeah.

2764
01:38:58.120 --> 01:39:02.280
Do I know of any weird temples around, like ruined temples

2765
01:39:03.250 --> 01:39:05.800
around these parts that would fit that description?

2766
01:39:06.728 --> 01:39:09.580
MATT: No, based on the history check you rolled, not really,

2767
01:39:09.580 --> 01:39:12.907
none that you know of.
MARISHA: Hmm.

2768
01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:19.000
But I know that Pride's Call is not far from here

2769
01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:21.502
and that's where they found the other beacon,

2770
01:39:21.502 --> 01:39:23.790
it's just north of here.
TRAVIS: Right.

2771
01:39:23.790 --> 01:39:27.757
MATT: Yeah, on the other side of this mountain range.

2772
01:39:27.757 --> 01:39:29.347
TRAVIS: Not that this isn't the most comfortable place

2773
01:39:29.347 --> 01:39:32.188
we've ever been in, but now that we're in here,

2774
01:39:33.950 --> 01:39:36.300
Jester, do you mind telling us--

2775
01:39:36.300 --> 01:39:38.370
SAM: Oh, yes.
TRAVIS: What actually happened?

2776
01:39:38.370 --> 01:39:40.070
SAM: What the fuck happened in there?

2777
01:39:41.511 --> 01:39:44.260
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

2778
01:39:44.260 --> 01:39:46.310
As I'm talking, I'm just going to be watching

2779
01:39:46.310 --> 01:39:48.840
from the direction we came and see if anything's

2780
01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:51.230
coming out of the mist towards us or anything.

2781
01:39:51.230 --> 01:39:52.063
MATT: You got it.

2782
01:39:53.590 --> 01:39:54.423
LAURA: Well,

2783
01:39:56.480 --> 01:40:01.367
okay, so, do you remember when I told you guys that

2784
01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:06.080
I could maybe do some, like, spells

2785
01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:09.990
that would maybe affect people's memories and stuff?

2786
01:40:09.990 --> 01:40:11.470
TALIESIN: No.
SAM: Don't remember that, but--

2787
01:40:11.470 --> 01:40:14.905
TALIESIN: Wow, you're real good.
LAURA: I, well, (laughs) no.

2788
01:40:14.905 --> 01:40:16.150
(laughter)

2789
01:40:16.150 --> 01:40:19.540
LAURA: I told you, I don't know, was I around everyone?

2790
01:40:19.540 --> 01:40:21.784
We were talking about it with Essek, right?

2791
01:40:21.784 --> 01:40:22.934
LIAM: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Huh.

2792
01:40:22.934 --> 01:40:24.583
LAURA: Anyway,

2793
01:40:24.583 --> 01:40:26.980
yes, so I--

2794
01:40:26.980 --> 01:40:31.030
I sort of altered her memory,

2795
01:40:31.030 --> 01:40:34.950
just a little, to where she was like, "Oh my gosh, Jester!"

2796
01:40:34.950 --> 01:40:37.010
I made her think that she, like, really liked me

2797
01:40:37.010 --> 01:40:39.040
and that we had a really amazing time hanging out,

2798
01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:41.620
like, we braided each other's hair and, you know,

2799
01:40:41.620 --> 01:40:43.540
she just took an immediate liking to me,

2800
01:40:43.540 --> 01:40:45.800
maybe she saw a little bit of herself in me,

2801
01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:47.300
I don't know, you know.

2802
01:40:47.300 --> 01:40:48.482
And so,

2803
01:40:49.780 --> 01:40:51.750
and then she was like,

2804
01:40:51.750 --> 01:40:53.570
"Oh my gosh, I just like you so much.

2805
01:40:53.570 --> 01:40:54.930
"What can I do to make you happy?"

2806
01:40:54.930 --> 01:40:56.440
And I was like, "Oh change, you know,

2807
01:40:56.440 --> 01:40:58.360
"help Nott out and change that."

2808
01:40:58.360 --> 01:40:59.702
And she did.

2809
01:40:59.702 --> 01:41:01.710
SAM: And it just worked?

2810
01:41:01.710 --> 01:41:02.615
LAURA: Well--

2811
01:41:02.615 --> 01:41:04.720
SAM: Did she realize what you had done?

2812
01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:07.090
LAURA: No, but she did seem a little confused at the end.

2813
01:41:07.090 --> 01:41:08.240
And you know what?

2814
01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:09.730
I don't know if that's normal because

2815
01:41:09.730 --> 01:41:12.570
I've never done this before, but just in case,

2816
01:41:12.570 --> 01:41:15.150
possibly, that it's not normal, I just thought

2817
01:41:15.150 --> 01:41:17.358
maybe it would be smart to leave.

2818
01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:20.090
TRAVIS: Sure.
LAURA: But, you know--

2819
01:41:20.090 --> 01:41:22.360
SAM: That's incredible--
LAURA: If it did work

2820
01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:25.390
and if does stick, then, you know, I have a really cool,

2821
01:41:25.390 --> 01:41:27.780
powerful good friend who likes cupcakes a lot.

2822
01:41:27.780 --> 01:41:29.480
I'm going to send her some, for sure.

2823
01:41:30.900 --> 01:41:31.981
SAM: Seems only fair.

2824
01:41:31.981 --> 01:41:33.668
TRAVIS: That's very resourceful, Jester.

2825
01:41:34.610 --> 01:41:36.630
TALIESIN: Wow.
SAM: Amazing.

2826
01:41:36.630 --> 01:41:37.610
LAURA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Wow.

2827
01:41:37.610 --> 01:41:40.235
TRAVIS: Were you nervous at all?

2828
01:41:40.235 --> 01:41:43.190
LAURA: Oh, well, of course.

2829
01:41:43.190 --> 01:41:45.000
She's really scary looking, right?

2830
01:41:47.468 --> 01:41:48.780
LIAM: You seem a little nervous now.

2831
01:41:48.780 --> 01:41:51.370
LAURA: Well yeah, because what if she comes after us?

2832
01:41:51.370 --> 01:41:54.200
SAM: I mean, all of us were nervous speaking with her.

2833
01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:56.990
At least, I was, I don't know about you,

2834
01:41:56.990 --> 01:41:58.950
that witch.
TRAVIS: If it didn't work,

2835
01:41:58.950 --> 01:42:00.500
what were you going to do then?

2836
01:42:02.107 --> 01:42:03.725
LAURA: Ooh,

2837
01:42:03.725 --> 01:42:05.120
like, run?

2838
01:42:06.430 --> 01:42:08.179
Maybe like--

2839
01:42:08.179 --> 01:42:09.050
TALIESIN: No.

2840
01:42:09.050 --> 01:42:11.860
LAURA: Dimension Door out of there, if I could,

2841
01:42:11.860 --> 01:42:16.185
or like-- (uncertain sound)

2842
01:42:16.185 --> 01:42:17.850
TRAVIS: We would've thrown down.

2843
01:42:17.850 --> 01:42:19.690
LAURA: It would've been a throw down probably

2844
01:42:19.690 --> 01:42:21.650
or maybe, no, she probably would have been

2845
01:42:21.650 --> 01:42:23.300
real pissed if she'd have figured it out.

2846
01:42:23.300 --> 01:42:24.710
It would've turned into a fight.

2847
01:42:24.710 --> 01:42:25.970
Who knows, she might've killed me.

2848
01:42:25.970 --> 01:42:29.170
LIAM: Anyway, thank you for getting the job done.

2849
01:42:29.170 --> 01:42:30.740
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: Yes, I mean,

2850
01:42:31.950 --> 01:42:36.200
I don't really feel any different, but I guess I am, now.

2851
01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:39.110
LAURA: I believe that she broke it.

2852
01:42:39.110 --> 01:42:44.110
It really was, like, super creepy magic stuff that she did,

2853
01:42:44.210 --> 01:42:46.100
so I think she broke it.

2854
01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:48.153
SAM: But

2855
01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:54.520
that's just, I mean, I have so many questions.

2856
01:42:56.755 --> 01:42:57.823
So if that's true,

2857
01:42:57.823 --> 01:43:00.950
then I could just change back whenever, I guess.

2858
01:43:00.950 --> 01:43:02.000
LAURA: I think so.

2859
01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.180
LIAM: Yeah, we would

2860
01:43:04.180 --> 01:43:06.060
go again.
SAM: That's great.

2861
01:43:06.060 --> 01:43:09.360
But what about Beauregard?

2862
01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:10.568
What about you?

2863
01:43:12.470 --> 01:43:13.560
MARISHA: What about me?

2864
01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:18.310
SAM: Well, I mean, didn't she affect your family somehow?

2865
01:43:20.140 --> 01:43:22.640
LAURA: I mean, here's the thing:

2866
01:43:24.244 --> 01:43:26.110
if she realizes

2867
01:43:26.110 --> 01:43:29.590
that, you know, I did something,

2868
01:43:30.460 --> 01:43:31.970
then it's possible.

2869
01:43:34.150 --> 01:43:37.090
SAM: But I mean, even if she doesn't realize,

2870
01:43:37.090 --> 01:43:39.030
it still could affect Beauregard, right?

2871
01:43:39.030 --> 01:43:43.000
Because you have this, your father did something with her?

2872
01:43:44.090 --> 01:43:46.280
MARISHA: Don't worry about me or mine.

2873
01:43:48.270 --> 01:43:49.470
SAM: Don't worry about you?

2874
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:53.670
But--
TALIESIN: I think it's possible

2875
01:43:53.670 --> 01:43:55.440
that if we killed her, the next day

2876
01:43:55.440 --> 01:43:57.540
all of your father's grapes would've died.

2877
01:43:58.438 --> 01:43:59.571
MARISHA: (snorting)

2878
01:43:59.571 --> 01:44:01.530
TALIESIN: Honestly.
TRAVIS: You know, it's true.

2879
01:44:01.530 --> 01:44:03.527
Or worse.
TALIESIN: That's probably what would have happened.

2880
01:44:03.527 --> 01:44:04.730
SAM: But you're not worried

2881
01:44:04.730 --> 01:44:07.540
about your family or your safety or anything?

2882
01:44:09.090 --> 01:44:10.700
TALIESIN: About what?

2883
01:44:10.700 --> 01:44:13.520
SAM: She said that there's a price to be paid, right?

2884
01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:14.900
A price to be paid

2885
01:44:16.810 --> 01:44:19.658
for what your father got.

2886
01:44:21.600 --> 01:44:22.455
TRAVIS: Right.

2887
01:44:22.455 --> 01:44:24.120
What're you driving at?
TALIESIN: I don't understand

2888
01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:26.160
what you're--
SAM: Aren't you worried about

2889
01:44:26.160 --> 01:44:28.209
anything befalling--
MARISHA: Yeah.

2890
01:44:28.209 --> 01:44:29.812
Yeah.

2891
01:44:29.812 --> 01:44:32.040
It doesn't matter, don't worry about it.

2892
01:44:32.040 --> 01:44:33.273
LAURA: Should we have killed her?

2893
01:44:33.273 --> 01:44:35.806
MARISHA: No, not at all.

2894
01:44:37.110 --> 01:44:38.980
TALIESIN: I don't think it's a price on

2895
01:44:38.980 --> 01:44:40.980
the family, I think it's a price on him.

2896
01:44:42.190 --> 01:44:44.420
LAURA: It's a price on everyone.
SAM: Maybe?

2897
01:44:44.420 --> 01:44:45.530
TALIESIN: Well, I mean, if you're going to

2898
01:44:45.530 --> 01:44:47.500
"maybe" things, you can maybe anything.

2899
01:44:47.500 --> 01:44:49.570
Maybe there is no price.

2900
01:44:49.570 --> 01:44:51.840
Maybe it's a price on everyone who works there,

2901
01:44:51.840 --> 01:44:53.400
maybe it's no price at all,

2902
01:44:53.400 --> 01:44:55.290
maybe it's just 10 bottles of wine.

2903
01:44:56.930 --> 01:44:59.460
Maybes are not useful.
TRAVIS: That deal was made

2904
01:44:59.460 --> 01:45:02.850
so long ago, I would be afraid it would unroot quite a bit.

2905
01:45:03.990 --> 01:45:07.270
TALIESIN: Maybe you're the price, maybe--

2906
01:45:07.270 --> 01:45:09.478
MARISHA: I thought I was.

2907
01:45:09.478 --> 01:45:11.650
LAURA: I'm glad you're not.

2908
01:45:11.650 --> 01:45:13.040
Because you're still here.

2909
01:45:14.090 --> 01:45:17.140
TALIESIN: Maybe it was his fear and not

2910
01:45:17.140 --> 01:45:19.490
being able to--
LAURA: Oh.

2911
01:45:19.490 --> 01:45:21.760
Ooh, that's deep.
TALIESIN: Thank you.

2912
01:45:21.760 --> 01:45:23.330
SAM: Wait, what was it?

2913
01:45:24.930 --> 01:45:26.840
His fear was the price?
LAURA: Yeah.

2914
01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:30.590
Like what if he made his entire life so miserable

2915
01:45:30.590 --> 01:45:33.340
because he was seeking this rich goal

2916
01:45:33.340 --> 01:45:37.060
that he ended up making himself miserable and Beau miserable

2917
01:45:37.060 --> 01:45:38.660
and all these people around him miserable

2918
01:45:38.660 --> 01:45:40.240
and that's what she was feeding off of,

2919
01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:41.990
that's the price that he paid?

2920
01:45:41.990 --> 01:45:44.420
He didn't get to live a happy life with his wife;

2921
01:45:44.420 --> 01:45:47.703
he lived a very sad-- sad life.

2922
01:45:47.703 --> 01:45:49.945
TALIESIN: And drove his daughter away.

2923
01:45:49.945 --> 01:45:51.953
MARISHA: And now he has a son.

2924
01:45:51.953 --> 01:45:53.278
LAURA: He'll do the same thing.

2925
01:45:54.198 --> 01:45:56.270
MARISHA: Maybe.

2926
01:45:56.270 --> 01:45:58.780
Or maybe the price has been paid.

2927
01:45:58.780 --> 01:46:01.180
LIAM: What's done is done; you can't turn back time.

2928
01:46:02.060 --> 01:46:03.580
TRAVIS: True, and it doesn't seem like it's something

2929
01:46:03.580 --> 01:46:07.550
that gets fulfilled, it just seems to keep going.

2930
01:46:07.550 --> 01:46:09.780
MARISHA: Is it?
LAURA: I don't know.

2931
01:46:09.780 --> 01:46:10.613
TALIESIN: I like having you here.

2932
01:46:10.613 --> 01:46:13.020
TRAVIS: She said, "The more, the better."

2933
01:46:13.020 --> 01:46:14.370
MARISHA: Yeah.

2934
01:46:15.362 --> 01:46:16.195
LAURA: What do you feel like?

2935
01:46:16.195 --> 01:46:18.870
Do you feel like your life is being siphoned away?

2936
01:46:18.870 --> 01:46:21.100
Do you feel happier right now?

2937
01:46:21.100 --> 01:46:23.250
SAM: Happier?
LAURA: Yeah.

2938
01:46:23.250 --> 01:46:25.240
Do you feel like somebody's sucking your life force?

2939
01:46:25.240 --> 01:46:26.730
TALIESIN: I feel like there's a--
SAM: I don't feel

2940
01:46:26.730 --> 01:46:28.310
that someone's sucking my life force.

2941
01:46:28.310 --> 01:46:30.310
MARISHA: I think it was a different deal.

2942
01:46:30.310 --> 01:46:32.240
TALIESIN: There's a maximum level of happiness

2943
01:46:32.240 --> 01:46:34.820
possible when you're ankle-deep in swamp.

2944
01:46:34.820 --> 01:46:38.890
I think this is lowering the baseline at the moment.

2945
01:46:39.815 --> 01:46:40.850
LAURA: Hey, hey, hey--

2946
01:46:40.850 --> 01:46:44.290
SAM: Honestly, I feel guilty right now.

2947
01:46:44.290 --> 01:46:45.610
LAURA: Guilty, why?
SAM: Because--

2948
01:46:45.610 --> 01:46:47.050
LIAM: Why?
SAM: Because

2949
01:46:47.050 --> 01:46:49.290
we all went in there, well I don't know, I mean,

2950
01:46:49.290 --> 01:46:51.810
you said that you had offered to

2951
01:46:52.950 --> 01:46:56.840
go away from us and live a life of solitude

2952
01:46:56.840 --> 01:47:00.320
in order to take this curse off of me.

2953
01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:01.153
I mean, that was

2954
01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:05.340
very brave of you and--

2955
01:47:05.340 --> 01:47:07.006
LAURA: And very not okay.

2956
01:47:07.006 --> 01:47:08.760
SAM: I mean, it was amazing.

2957
01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:09.940
TRAVIS: No, I don't think it was.

2958
01:47:09.940 --> 01:47:12.370
TALIESIN: I disagree with that entirely.

2959
01:47:12.370 --> 01:47:13.203
SAM: What are you talking about?

2960
01:47:13.203 --> 01:47:14.900
It was a sacrifice for her friend.

2961
01:47:14.900 --> 01:47:16.160
LAURA: It would have been a sacrifice

2962
01:47:16.160 --> 01:47:18.250
for her and for everyone else.

2963
01:47:18.250 --> 01:47:20.391
Beau, you wouldn't just have just been--
SAM: For her mostly, though.

2964
01:47:20.391 --> 01:47:23.599
LAURA: --making yourself miserable. We would've been--

2965
01:47:23.599 --> 01:47:25.382
TRAVIS: We would've been miserable.

2966
01:47:25.382 --> 01:47:26.732
LAURA: We would've been so sad.
SAM: But she would've been

2967
01:47:26.732 --> 01:47:28.210
even more so.
ASHLEY: I mean,

2968
01:47:28.210 --> 01:47:31.140
we still would've lost a friend in the end, so.

2969
01:47:32.120 --> 01:47:36.100
TRAVIS: I think the hag pushed
us to a lot of ultimate decisions.

2970
01:47:36.100 --> 01:47:38.500
Beau was ready to move away from everything,

2971
01:47:38.500 --> 01:47:40.380
you were ready to entertain war between nations.

2972
01:47:40.380 --> 01:47:41.213
SAM: I know, that's what I'm saying!

2973
01:47:41.213 --> 01:47:44.661
That-- the thing that I-- I was a coward.

2974
01:47:44.661 --> 01:47:46.541
LAURA: Whisper.
SAM: (quieter) I was a coward.

2975
01:47:46.541 --> 01:47:47.742
MATT: (groaning)

2976
01:47:47.742 --> 01:47:48.980
SAM: Sorry, sorry.

2977
01:47:48.980 --> 01:47:49.930
MATT: You all get quiet for a minute

2978
01:47:49.930 --> 01:47:52.303
and you watch as two of these zombies

2979
01:47:52.303 --> 01:47:55.180
come lumbering through the swamp, wading.

2980
01:47:55.180 --> 01:47:56.470
MARISHA: I open the door to the hut

2981
01:47:56.470 --> 01:47:59.160
and I just throw one of my ball bearings.

2982
01:47:59.160 --> 01:48:00.390
LAURA: There's no door.
LIAM: No, there is no door.

2983
01:48:00.390 --> 01:48:01.910
MARISHA: Oh, I just reach through and I go

2984
01:48:01.910 --> 01:48:04.130
and toss a ball bearing.

2985
01:48:04.130 --> 01:48:05.610
TRAVIS: It's the South, there's a screen door.

2986
01:48:05.610 --> 01:48:06.610
MARISHA: Yeah, whatever.

2987
01:48:06.610 --> 01:48:09.595
MATT: They're both (groaning) and one of them finds the hut

2988
01:48:09.595 --> 01:48:12.245
and is scraping against the exterior.

2989
01:48:13.470 --> 01:48:14.303
(splashing)

2990
01:48:14.303 --> 01:48:18.824
They both-- (gasp) and (splashing footsteps).

2991
01:48:18.824 --> 01:48:22.227
MARISHA: Can't deal with any distractions right now.

2992
01:48:22.227 --> 01:48:24.910
LAURA: Hey Caleb, can anybody scry on us in the hut?

2993
01:48:26.180 --> 01:48:27.560
LIAM: Well, we are packed pretty tightly

2994
01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:30.080
and no one can scry on me, so probably

2995
01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:31.747
not at the moment.
LAURA: Okay.

2996
01:48:33.340 --> 01:48:34.565
Just making sure.

2997
01:48:37.601 --> 01:48:39.326
MARISHA: What?
LIAM: Don't go.

2998
01:48:41.910 --> 01:48:44.410
MARISHA: Well, I mean, this isn't
going to last forever, right?

2999
01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:47.120
So if--
TALIESIN: That doesn't mean

3000
01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:48.820
you pull the pin on it.

3001
01:48:48.820 --> 01:48:50.400
LIAM: Follow your own advice.

3002
01:48:52.330 --> 01:48:53.163
Don't go.

3003
01:48:56.370 --> 01:48:59.960
TALIESIN: I know you think you're done, I understand.

3004
01:49:01.042 --> 01:49:02.600
You're not done yet.

3005
01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:04.140
MARISHA: How do you know?

3006
01:49:04.140 --> 01:49:07.180
TALIESIN: I know things.
MARISHA: Okay.

3007
01:49:08.030 --> 01:49:10.000
That's not an answer, you know that.

3008
01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:11.870
TRAVIS: All right, I'll answer it: you're young,

3009
01:49:11.870 --> 01:49:15.320
you're full of life, you hook up with anything that moves.

3010
01:49:15.320 --> 01:49:17.870
You haven't even begun to live your life.

3011
01:49:18.810 --> 01:49:21.180
I'm this much older than you and you're ready to quit

3012
01:49:21.180 --> 01:49:23.870
and move on from everything that's good in your world?

3013
01:49:27.140 --> 01:49:28.320
TALIESIN: There's a greatness in you that

3014
01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:31.300
you've maybe known three months.

3015
01:49:32.340 --> 01:49:33.740
This is just the beginning.

3016
01:49:34.890 --> 01:49:38.370
TRAVIS: To think that you've peaked is insane.

3017
01:49:38.370 --> 01:49:39.840
MARISHA: Well, what are you going to do?

3018
01:49:40.700 --> 01:49:41.700
What are your goals?

3019
01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:45.775
TRAVIS: To stay with my friends,

3020
01:49:45.775 --> 01:49:48.080
to see what happens, to watch over you.

3021
01:49:48.080 --> 01:49:52.440
You've watched over me as I've explored my past.

3022
01:49:52.440 --> 01:49:55.120
The least I can do is return the favor.

3023
01:49:55.120 --> 01:49:57.940
I'm invested now, I want to see peace between these nations,

3024
01:49:57.940 --> 01:50:02.940
I want to see what this green-cloaked figure is

3025
01:50:02.981 --> 01:50:05.378
that Jester keeps talking to--
LAURA: His name is the Traveler.

3026
01:50:05.378 --> 01:50:06.986
TRAVIS: I want to see Nott get back what she wants--

3027
01:50:06.986 --> 01:50:07.819
LAURA: His name is the Traveler.
TRAVIS: Yes, the Traveler.

3028
01:50:07.819 --> 01:50:10.130
LAURA: His name's the Traveler and he's really awesome.
TRAVIS: All right, it's fine.

3029
01:50:10.130 --> 01:50:11.880
TALIESIN: We owe it to each other.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

3030
01:50:12.900 --> 01:50:14.160
Nott doesn't seem to care about me,

3031
01:50:14.160 --> 01:50:15.850
but I care about her, it's okay.

3032
01:50:15.850 --> 01:50:18.311
SAM: I care about you, Fjord.
TRAVIS: Tell me again.

3033
01:50:18.311 --> 01:50:22.130
(laughter)

3034
01:50:22.130 --> 01:50:25.270
SAM: I care about you, Fjord. I care about all of you.

3035
01:50:27.010 --> 01:50:29.460
You all would've sacrificed so much for me.

3036
01:50:29.460 --> 01:50:33.190
You did, you risked your life in there.

3037
01:50:33.190 --> 01:50:35.080
She could've seen through your little spell

3038
01:50:35.080 --> 01:50:37.810
and taken off your cute little head.

3039
01:50:37.810 --> 01:50:41.070
LAURA: Well, she would've taken
off my cute little hands faster.

3040
01:50:42.110 --> 01:50:44.730
SAM: That's bad, too.

3041
01:50:44.730 --> 01:50:47.530
MARISHA: We would have come running in at the first yelp.

3042
01:50:48.660 --> 01:50:50.210
LAURA: If you could.

3043
01:50:50.210 --> 01:50:52.043
TALIESIN: We're not done until we've saved each other.
LAURA: I don't know what's

3044
01:50:52.043 --> 01:50:53.210
going on in that hut, you guys.

3045
01:50:53.210 --> 01:50:56.890
TRAVIS: And why would we have
come running in at the first yelp?

3046
01:50:56.890 --> 01:51:01.120
Your delts are crazy.
MARISHA: Thank you.

3047
01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:03.290
TRAVIS: Why would we have come running in?

3048
01:51:03.290 --> 01:51:05.280
MARISHA: Because we care about each other.

3049
01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:06.800
TRAVIS: Oh, fucking shit, we do?

3050
01:51:06.800 --> 01:51:09.514
Amazing, does that apply to you as well?

3051
01:51:09.514 --> 01:51:11.473
MARISHA: (mumbling) I don't know.
TRAVIS: Oh, I think it does.

3052
01:51:11.473 --> 01:51:14.520
(laughter)

3053
01:51:14.520 --> 01:51:15.750
TRAVIS: Don't do that again.

3054
01:51:18.610 --> 01:51:20.410
Don't you care what happens to Nott?

3055
01:51:22.808 --> 01:51:25.420
LIAM: Don't do that again.
MARISHA: I guess.

3056
01:51:25.420 --> 01:51:26.920
TRAVIS: Jester?
MARISHA: I guess.

3057
01:51:26.920 --> 01:51:27.940
TRAVIS: Yasha.
MARISHA: Okay.

3058
01:51:27.940 --> 01:51:29.160
TRAVIS: This one.
MARISHA: Yeah.

3059
01:51:29.160 --> 01:51:30.827
TRAVIS: Most of all.
MARISHA: Bleh.

3060
01:51:34.864 --> 01:51:37.610
TALIESIN: I love you guys.

3061
01:51:37.610 --> 01:51:39.102
TRAVIS: We did really good.

3062
01:51:40.099 --> 01:51:42.790
That was crazy, you should've seen her up there on the roof.

3063
01:51:42.790 --> 01:51:45.231
Bitch had four elbows.

3064
01:51:45.231 --> 01:51:46.880
It's not normal.

3065
01:51:46.880 --> 01:51:51.240
I saw it, like, literally, I have to do a poop check.

3066
01:51:51.240 --> 01:51:53.326
I want to do it here but we're all trapped in this bubble.

3067
01:51:53.326 --> 01:51:55.540
LAURA: Nott still has poop on her leg from--

3068
01:51:57.145 --> 01:51:58.425
SAM: What was that from, again?

3069
01:51:58.425 --> 01:51:59.700
(laughter)

3070
01:51:59.700 --> 01:52:01.110
LAURA: From seeing the hag.
SAM: Oh.

3071
01:52:01.110 --> 01:52:02.960
TRAVIS: Yep. I don't want to look.

3072
01:52:02.960 --> 01:52:05.331
I don't want to break the seal and we'll all be fucked.

3073
01:52:05.331 --> 01:52:07.581
(laughter)

3074
01:52:10.228 --> 01:52:11.920
LIAM: Anyway, we just got this one back,

3075
01:52:11.920 --> 01:52:13.220
we don't need to lose one.

3076
01:52:15.190 --> 01:52:16.070
Nobody goes.

3077
01:52:18.310 --> 01:52:19.143
MARISHA: Okay.

3078
01:52:23.570 --> 01:52:24.620
Okay.

3079
01:52:24.620 --> 01:52:26.160
LAURA: Good.

3080
01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:29.700
MARISHA: Do you think my brother's destined

3081
01:52:29.700 --> 01:52:32.220
for a life of misery, though?

3082
01:52:32.220 --> 01:52:34.590
LAURA: Well, maybe you can break him from that.

3083
01:52:35.832 --> 01:52:37.140
MARISHA: Maybe there are other ways.

3084
01:52:37.140 --> 01:52:39.007
SAM: Like how? Do you want to kidnap him?

3085
01:52:39.007 --> 01:52:40.982
LAURA: No, but--
MARISHA: Maybe?

3086
01:52:40.982 --> 01:52:42.660
SAM: I was kind of thinking about it.

3087
01:52:42.660 --> 01:52:43.876
MARISHA: That's not a bad idea.
TRAVIS: Wait.

3088
01:52:43.876 --> 01:52:45.250
Did you say kidnap him?
MARISHA: Yeah,

3089
01:52:45.250 --> 01:52:46.430
what if we just suddenly take him?

3090
01:52:46.430 --> 01:52:48.920
SAM: Beauregard said something interesting.

3091
01:52:48.920 --> 01:52:51.760
She said, "Oh Luc and my brother," what is his name?

3092
01:52:51.760 --> 01:52:53.690
JT? TJ?
MARISHA: TJ.

3093
01:52:53.690 --> 01:52:54.800
SAM: TJ.
MARISHA: Thoreau, Jr.

3094
01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:56.700
My dad's got an ego.

3095
01:52:56.700 --> 01:52:58.300
SAM: Luc and TJ could be friends.

3096
01:52:58.300 --> 01:53:00.950
What if just went back and kidnapped your brother

3097
01:53:00.950 --> 01:53:02.250
and took him to live--
LAURA: (gasps) What if we

3098
01:53:02.250 --> 01:53:06.933
go up there, I Dimension Door in, I snag him up, bamf out--

3099
01:53:06.933 --> 01:53:10.933
TALIESIN: Maybe TJ is going to reach an age

3100
01:53:10.933 --> 01:53:13.930
and he'll reach out and you'll be there to get him out of

3101
01:53:13.930 --> 01:53:15.010
a bad situation.
LAURA: It's true.

3102
01:53:15.010 --> 01:53:18.040
Nothing makes siblings connect faster

3103
01:53:18.040 --> 01:53:20.250
than shitty parents.
MARISHA: That's true.

3104
01:53:21.530 --> 01:53:25.540
Plus, I have a good way of talking with angsty teens, so.

3105
01:53:26.720 --> 01:53:29.772
SAM: Just have to wait 10 years.

3106
01:53:29.772 --> 01:53:32.395
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.
SAM: Really connect.

3107
01:53:32.395 --> 01:53:35.960
ASHLEY: And he's probably safer
there than, you know, taking--

3108
01:53:35.960 --> 01:53:38.463
we can't take a baby on the road with us, you know?

3109
01:53:38.463 --> 01:53:40.280
TRAVIS: We barely took care of Kiri.
LIAM: He's with his mother.

3110
01:53:40.280 --> 01:53:41.390
LAURA: Kiri turned out great, okay?

3111
01:53:41.390 --> 01:53:43.500
MARISHA: He's behind shatterproof glass.

3112
01:53:43.500 --> 01:53:44.720
SAM: Is your mother

3113
01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:46.223
caring at all?
TRAVIS: She's walking around with a dagger,

3114
01:53:46.223 --> 01:53:48.502
telling people to go fuck themselves.

3115
01:53:50.410 --> 01:53:52.490
MARISHA: She's caring when she--

3116
01:53:53.900 --> 01:53:56.920
she's caring, yeah. She cares.

3117
01:53:56.920 --> 01:54:00.060
LAURA: I bet when your dad isn't around, your mom's cool.

3118
01:54:01.370 --> 01:54:05.513
MARISHA: That's kind of exactly it, yeah.

3119
01:54:07.810 --> 01:54:10.840
SAM: What if when your mom's not around, is that okay?

3120
01:54:13.978 --> 01:54:15.630
MARISHA: I think it's a little different.

3121
01:54:17.180 --> 01:54:20.740
If you're talking about yourself, it is 100% different

3122
01:54:20.740 --> 01:54:23.640
and do not fucking compare yourself to my parents.

3123
01:54:23.640 --> 01:54:25.770
SAM: Well, I'm totally absent right now.

3124
01:54:25.770 --> 01:54:27.920
MARISHA: But there's a difference between

3125
01:54:27.920 --> 01:54:30.750
pursuing the things that make you happy

3126
01:54:30.750 --> 01:54:33.340
and showing that and being an example to your kids

3127
01:54:33.340 --> 01:54:35.190
and then just totally fucking being

3128
01:54:35.190 --> 01:54:38.090
so self absorbed in your own damage that you

3129
01:54:38.090 --> 01:54:41.734
just transfer all of that and neglect them.

3130
01:54:41.734 --> 01:54:43.620
TRAVIS: That's very well put, actually.

3131
01:54:43.620 --> 01:54:45.036
TALIESIN: That's really well put.

3132
01:54:45.036 --> 01:54:46.752
ASHLEY: What were your parents like?

3133
01:54:46.752 --> 01:54:49.538
What was your mom's name?

3134
01:54:49.538 --> 01:54:51.630
(laughter)

3135
01:54:51.630 --> 01:54:52.463
TALIESIN: Wow.

3136
01:54:52.463 --> 01:54:57.110
(laughter)

3137
01:54:57.110 --> 01:54:58.710
TRAVIS: Chef's kiss.

3138
01:54:58.710 --> 01:55:01.420
SAM: I had lovely parents.
ASHLEY: Yeah?

3139
01:55:01.420 --> 01:55:03.195
SAM: Ashley was her name.

3140
01:55:03.195 --> 01:55:04.410
(laughter)

3141
01:55:04.410 --> 01:55:06.460
MATT: Everyone write that down.

3142
01:55:06.460 --> 01:55:08.877
SAM: It was easy to remember.

3143
01:55:09.725 --> 01:55:11.660
TRAVIS: And your father?
SAM: Travis.

3144
01:55:11.660 --> 01:55:15.245
(laughter)

3145
01:55:15.245 --> 01:55:16.640
ASHLEY: Wow, they sound, those are the most--

3146
01:55:16.640 --> 01:55:18.556
TRAVIS: Canon.
ASHLEY: Those are great names.

3147
01:55:18.556 --> 01:55:20.800
LAURA: Those are really good names.
TRAVIS: Strong, strong names.

3148
01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:22.420
Warriors' names.

3149
01:55:22.420 --> 01:55:24.110
SAM: I had three older brothers who

3150
01:55:24.110 --> 01:55:26.600
I didn't get along with too well,

3151
01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:29.790
but my parents were loving and kind and--

3152
01:55:29.790 --> 01:55:31.950
TALIESIN: My parents would take long trips.

3153
01:55:34.080 --> 01:55:35.990
SAM: Wait, yeah? Okay.

3154
01:55:35.990 --> 01:55:38.770
How did you cope with that?
TALIESIN: Very well.

3155
01:55:38.770 --> 01:55:41.110
We had a close family

3156
01:55:41.110 --> 01:55:44.500
and pilgrimages and leaving home to

3157
01:55:46.590 --> 01:55:50.420
check in on other people was pretty common.

3158
01:55:50.420 --> 01:55:52.770
They'd be gone months at a time sometimes.

3159
01:55:52.770 --> 01:55:55.030
ASHLEY: Your parents?
TALIESIN: And my aunt.

3160
01:55:55.030 --> 01:55:58.060
Not all at once, obviously, but yes.

3161
01:55:58.060 --> 01:55:59.500
Eventually, every now and then,

3162
01:55:59.500 --> 01:56:02.800
some of my siblings would go, too.

3163
01:56:02.800 --> 01:56:06.820
I would've eventually gone for things longer than two weeks

3164
01:56:06.820 --> 01:56:09.180
to get supplies, but--
SAM: Was it lonely?

3165
01:56:09.180 --> 01:56:10.990
Did you miss them?
TALIESIN: Well,

3166
01:56:10.990 --> 01:56:12.790
I missed them, but it wasn't lonely.

3167
01:56:13.880 --> 01:56:15.280
SAM: How did you know that they still

3168
01:56:15.280 --> 01:56:16.830
loved you while they were gone?

3169
01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:23.012
TALIESIN: Absence isn't the opposite of love.

3170
01:56:24.730 --> 01:56:28.560
Plenty of ways to show someone you don't love them

3171
01:56:28.560 --> 01:56:30.400
that don't involve not being there.

3172
01:56:31.570 --> 01:56:34.070
Being off and doing good work was important.

3173
01:56:35.430 --> 01:56:37.730
That's what we did as a family.

3174
01:56:41.870 --> 01:56:43.570
They were being their best selves.

3175
01:56:44.990 --> 01:56:49.750
LAURA: My dad wasn't around and
he was off doing good work and--

3176
01:56:49.750 --> 01:56:50.583
SAM and MARISHA: Well...

3177
01:56:50.583 --> 01:56:53.020
TALIESIN: Sure.
SAM: He was doing work.

3178
01:56:54.010 --> 01:56:54.843
LAURA: But--
MARISHA: He was

3179
01:56:54.843 --> 01:56:56.860
very successful at the work he did, no doubt.

3180
01:56:57.918 --> 01:57:00.460
LAURA: Yeah. And you know what, though?

3181
01:57:00.460 --> 01:57:04.490
My mom always told me if he could be here, he would,

3182
01:57:04.490 --> 01:57:08.290
and that if he knew me, he would love the shit out of me.

3183
01:57:08.290 --> 01:57:10.870
She didn't say it exactly like that, but.

3184
01:57:12.050 --> 01:57:13.660
You know, your husband is telling

3185
01:57:13.660 --> 01:57:15.860
your son how much you love him.

3186
01:57:18.780 --> 01:57:20.488
SAM: But I--
LAURA: He knows.

3187
01:57:23.340 --> 01:57:26.880
SAM: But I could be there. I can, as soon as we want.

3188
01:57:27.880 --> 01:57:30.200
LAURA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: That's true of anything.

3189
01:57:30.200 --> 01:57:31.300
That's true right now.

3190
01:57:32.660 --> 01:57:34.230
LAURA: You could have been there this whole time, though.

3191
01:57:34.230 --> 01:57:35.530
TALIESIN: That's true a month ago.

3192
01:57:37.950 --> 01:57:41.845
LAURA: It's pretty obvious that
Yeza would accept you as you are.

3193
01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:47.580
MARISHA: You're also making boatloads of cash,

3194
01:57:47.580 --> 01:57:51.400
which can totally go towards a great scholarship

3195
01:57:51.400 --> 01:57:53.353
and a retirement fund, you know?

3196
01:57:53.353 --> 01:57:54.803
TRAVIS: Braces are not cheap these days.

3197
01:57:54.803 --> 01:57:57.270
MARISHA: Absolutely.
LAURA: Fjord knows.

3198
01:57:57.270 --> 01:57:58.508
You don't want--

3199
01:57:58.508 --> 01:58:00.200
(laughter)

3200
01:58:00.200 --> 01:58:02.030
LAURA: You don't want Luc filing down his own teeth.

3201
01:58:02.030 --> 01:58:03.360
That shit hurts.

3202
01:58:03.360 --> 01:58:04.560
SAM: No, I don't.
TRAVIS: True that.

3203
01:58:05.530 --> 01:58:08.660
LAURA: They look good, though, they're looking real good.

3204
01:58:08.660 --> 01:58:10.130
TRAVIS: Thanks, Jester.
SAM: But what if I--

3205
01:58:10.130 --> 01:58:13.470
what if when I change, if I-- when I change back,

3206
01:58:13.470 --> 01:58:18.420
what if I don't want to stay with you guys?

3207
01:58:19.780 --> 01:58:21.210
LAURA: Then you don't have to.
TALIESIN: You don't have to,

3208
01:58:21.210 --> 01:58:22.670
that's okay, but just make sure

3209
01:58:22.670 --> 01:58:24.810
you're doing it for the right reasons.

3210
01:58:24.810 --> 01:58:26.840
TRAVIS: It's important that you know that we want you to,

3211
01:58:26.840 --> 01:58:29.900
but your decision matters the most.

3212
01:58:29.900 --> 01:58:32.290
LAURA: And if you don't stay with us,

3213
01:58:35.210 --> 01:58:36.500
we'll know you love us.

3214
01:58:42.310 --> 01:58:43.143
SAM: Mm-hmm.

3215
01:58:45.650 --> 01:58:49.210
ASHLEY: Does thinking about going back home and having

3216
01:58:50.460 --> 01:58:54.260
a family life, is that an exciting thought to you?

3217
01:58:57.979 --> 01:58:59.162
SAM: (sighs) Yes and no.

3218
01:58:59.162 --> 01:59:02.560
I mean, yes, of course, I want to be with my family.

3219
01:59:04.780 --> 01:59:07.840
They need me, I need to be with them and

3220
01:59:11.160 --> 01:59:12.990
it's all I've wanted for so long but

3221
01:59:15.150 --> 01:59:16.970
just to go back and to be

3222
01:59:20.580 --> 01:59:22.800
a supporting player in my story

3223
01:59:25.360 --> 01:59:30.360
doesn't seem-- I don't know how I would feel about that.

3224
01:59:30.530 --> 01:59:34.870
I mean, we've had so many amazing adventures together.

3225
01:59:34.870 --> 01:59:36.270
You tried to kill me.

3226
01:59:37.233 --> 01:59:40.182
And that's crazy, that's exciting.

3227
01:59:40.182 --> 01:59:42.360
ASHLEY: Nott, I didn't...
SAM: Well, I mean--

3228
01:59:42.360 --> 01:59:44.270
TALIESIN: You've tried to kill me a couple times.

3229
01:59:44.270 --> 01:59:45.900
SAM: I almost did kill you.
ASHLEY: No, you've tried to kill,

3230
01:59:45.900 --> 01:59:48.200
you've actually, you've--

3231
01:59:48.200 --> 01:59:49.900
I think you stabbed me a few times.

3232
01:59:49.900 --> 01:59:52.470
SAM: Oh, I'm sure, yes.
MARISHA: Beau has shot me in the ass.

3233
01:59:52.470 --> 01:59:55.389
Sorry, Nott has shot Beau in the ass.

3234
01:59:55.389 --> 01:59:56.880
(laughter)

3235
01:59:56.880 --> 01:59:59.580
LAURA: You're Beau.
MARISHA: I'm Beau.

3236
01:59:59.580 --> 02:00:03.430
I'm exhausted, literally.
MATT: Literally.

3237
02:00:03.430 --> 02:00:04.992
SAM: (shushes)
MARISHA: Sorry.

3238
02:00:04.992 --> 02:00:06.857
MATT: (zombie groaning)

3239
02:00:06.857 --> 02:00:08.741
LAURA: Shh shh shh.

3240
02:00:08.741 --> 02:00:10.886
MARISHA: I throw another ball bearing.

3241
02:00:10.886 --> 02:00:12.382
MATT: (chuckling)
TRAVIS: (groaning)

3242
02:00:12.382 --> 02:00:13.590
ALL: (laughter)

3243
02:00:13.590 --> 02:00:14.841
MATT: (gulps)

3244
02:00:14.841 --> 02:00:15.991
(choking)

3245
02:00:15.991 --> 02:00:17.051
TRAVIS: (explosion sound)

3246
02:00:17.051 --> 02:00:19.575
ALL: (laughter)

3247
02:00:19.575 --> 02:00:20.950
TRAVIS: Shit.

3248
02:00:20.950 --> 02:00:22.733
We went about that the wrong way before.

3249
02:00:22.733 --> 02:00:24.530
(laughter)

3250
02:00:24.530 --> 02:00:27.435
SAM: I just don't know how, I don't know how to manage it.

3251
02:00:27.435 --> 02:00:29.341
MARISHA: Not knowing the Heimlich, the most deadly thing.

3252
02:00:29.341 --> 02:00:30.174
(laughter)

3253
02:00:30.174 --> 02:00:32.240
SAM: I do want to be with them,
of course I want to be with them,

3254
02:00:32.240 --> 02:00:34.410
and I'm worried that when I get to

3255
02:00:34.410 --> 02:00:36.980
be with them again, I won't want to leave.

3256
02:00:36.980 --> 02:00:39.830
And if I do, I'll feel shitty about it.

3257
02:00:39.830 --> 02:00:42.840
And when I'm with you, I'll feel great,

3258
02:00:42.840 --> 02:00:44.940
but I'll also feel a little bit shitty

3259
02:00:44.940 --> 02:00:47.720
and when I'm with them, I'll feel great

3260
02:00:47.720 --> 02:00:49.450
but also a little bit shitty.

3261
02:00:49.450 --> 02:00:53.365
And I'm not brave enough to do either.

3262
02:00:53.365 --> 02:00:57.152
TALIESIN: I think-- I've been
thinking this for a while, Nott.

3263
02:00:58.820 --> 02:01:03.120
There is a truth to the idea that you could've gone back

3264
02:01:03.120 --> 02:01:04.933
at any time.
SAM: Mm-hmm.

3265
02:01:06.680 --> 02:01:08.905
TALIESIN: Have you ever really

3266
02:01:08.905 --> 02:01:12.071
taken some sober quiet time

3267
02:01:12.071 --> 02:01:15.045
to think about what it is that you actually want

3268
02:01:15.045 --> 02:01:16.506
and not what you think you should want?

3269
02:01:16.506 --> 02:01:17.620
LAURA: (gasps)

3270
02:01:18.620 --> 02:01:21.584
SAM: Sober's not my thing, really.

3271
02:01:21.584 --> 02:01:24.560
LAURA: Well--
TALIESIN: If it's possible to just sit

3272
02:01:24.560 --> 02:01:28.025
and really try and clear your mind and

3273
02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.091
figure out what it is

3274
02:01:33.967 --> 02:01:35.942
that would bring you the most peace.

3275
02:01:35.942 --> 02:01:38.420
SAM: I've never really been religious or anything,

3276
02:01:38.420 --> 02:01:40.390
but do you think I should sit and--

3277
02:01:40.390 --> 02:01:41.280
LAURA: Pray to the Traveler?

3278
02:01:41.280 --> 02:01:44.880
Definitely.
TALIESIN: I was going to suggest

3279
02:01:44.880 --> 02:01:47.430
maybe some quiet meditation, but.

3280
02:01:47.430 --> 02:01:48.670
SAM: Is that something you can do

3281
02:01:48.670 --> 02:01:51.830
without believing in some god thing?

3282
02:01:51.830 --> 02:01:54.390
LAURA: To just sit and be quiet?
TALIESIN: Only have to believe in quiet.

3283
02:01:54.390 --> 02:01:56.757
MARISHA: I could teach you that.
SAM: Oh yeah?

3284
02:01:56.757 --> 02:01:58.490
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: I mean, I--

3285
02:01:58.490 --> 02:02:00.675
MARISHA: It's like monk 101 shit.

3286
02:02:02.707 --> 02:02:06.130
SAM: A Skillshare class?
MARISHA: Yeah.

3287
02:02:06.130 --> 02:02:07.210
It's 75 gold.
TALIESIN: You only

3288
02:02:07.210 --> 02:02:08.566
have to believe in yourself.

3289
02:02:08.566 --> 02:02:09.699
(laughter)

3290
02:02:09.699 --> 02:02:11.927
MARISHA: It's a subscription service.

3291
02:02:11.927 --> 02:02:14.210
LIAM: I thought monk 101 was horse ass-slapping.

3292
02:02:14.210 --> 02:02:16.770
MARISHA: That's another Skillshare course.

3293
02:02:16.770 --> 02:02:18.973
ASHLEY: You learn a lot in 101.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3294
02:02:18.973 --> 02:02:21.455
TRAVIS: Yeah. That first year's a bitch.

3295
02:02:21.455 --> 02:02:22.888
Backpack's super heavy.

3296
02:02:22.888 --> 02:02:24.520
(laughter)

3297
02:02:24.520 --> 02:02:25.865
TRAVIS: Fucking Cobalt--

3298
02:02:25.865 --> 02:02:26.698
(laughter)

3299
02:02:26.698 --> 02:02:27.739
TRAVIS: -class load.

3300
02:02:28.715 --> 02:02:30.198
MARISHA: Let's jog a mile first.

3301
02:02:30.198 --> 02:02:31.380
(laughter)

3302
02:02:31.380 --> 02:02:33.380
SAM: All right, maybe if we have some time.

3303
02:02:33.380 --> 02:02:35.500
I mean, we're in the swamp of doom here, we can't--

3304
02:02:35.500 --> 02:02:38.340
LIAM: We're also pressed like
sardines because we don't have,

3305
02:02:38.340 --> 02:02:39.850
oh no, we cleared it, we cleared it--

3306
02:02:39.850 --> 02:02:42.513
MATT: You cleared it; you got space.
MARISHA: We could do this right now.

3307
02:02:42.513 --> 02:02:44.570
LAURA: But we're really close because we're whispering, so.

3308
02:02:44.570 --> 02:02:46.490
MARISHA: Meditation is about

3309
02:02:46.490 --> 02:02:49.348
blocking out everything around you

3310
02:02:49.348 --> 02:02:52.281
and your head and just...

3311
02:02:53.690 --> 02:02:54.760
SAM: All right.
LAURA: I can help.

3312
02:02:54.760 --> 02:02:56.440
I'll just, yeah, I'll just poke.

3313
02:02:56.440 --> 02:02:57.990
I'll just poke Nott the whole time.

3314
02:02:57.990 --> 02:03:00.390
MARISHA: That's high level meditation, that's like--

3315
02:03:00.390 --> 02:03:02.540
TALIESIN: She's not ready for that.
MARISHA: --a challenge.

3316
02:03:02.540 --> 02:03:04.350
SAM: Should I get drunk first or--

3317
02:03:04.350 --> 02:03:05.775
MARISHA: No.
LAURA: No, no.

3318
02:03:05.775 --> 02:03:08.840
MARISHA: You really shouldn't--
TALIESIN: That will make it hard.

3319
02:03:08.840 --> 02:03:12.420
MARISHA: I appreciate that sentiment
and I know where you're going,

3320
02:03:12.420 --> 02:03:14.440
but no.
LIAM: Maybe you should

3321
02:03:15.280 --> 02:03:20.280
skip that flask for a few days and think about it.

3322
02:03:20.680 --> 02:03:21.920
LAURA: What is it considered?

3323
02:03:21.920 --> 02:03:25.936
Does it make you wise when you are meditating?

3324
02:03:25.936 --> 02:03:27.400
SAM: Do you want to try it with me?

3325
02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:30.760
MARISHA: Am I about to lead the group in a group meditation?

3326
02:03:30.760 --> 02:03:33.460
TRAVIS: Fuck yes, let's do that.
MARISHA: All right, all right.

3327
02:03:33.460 --> 02:03:34.892
Who wants to meditate?
SAM: I do.

3328
02:03:34.892 --> 02:03:36.433
TRAVIS: I'm ready. I'm always down.

3329
02:03:36.433 --> 02:03:38.733
LIAM: It's a yoga class in a zombie field.

3330
02:03:38.733 --> 02:03:39.661
TRAVIS: This is a first.

3331
02:03:39.661 --> 02:03:40.544
(laughter)

3332
02:03:40.544 --> 02:03:41.520
This is a first.
MATT: Which, mind you,

3333
02:03:41.520 --> 02:03:44.820
the space in here is very much like a sleepover.

3334
02:03:44.820 --> 02:03:47.680
You're all are Tetris-ed in this interior space.

3335
02:03:47.680 --> 02:03:49.350
TALIESIN: I'll also say that we all are exhausted,

3336
02:03:49.350 --> 02:03:50.332
so this is going to be really hard.

3337
02:03:50.332 --> 02:03:51.398
MARISHA: Yeah, everyone's just going to fall asleep.

3338
02:03:51.398 --> 02:03:52.231
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3339
02:03:52.231 --> 02:03:53.720
ALL: (laughter)
TRAVIS: (mimics falling)

3340
02:03:55.120 --> 02:03:56.875
LAURA: But I'm going to-- wait, before we do this.

3341
02:03:56.875 --> 02:03:58.830
SAM: Do we need a word?
MARISHA: What? No.

3342
02:03:58.830 --> 02:04:00.877
SAM: Like a chanting word?

3343
02:04:00.877 --> 02:04:01.710
Don't you have a--
MARISHA: That's a

3344
02:04:01.710 --> 02:04:03.000
monkey chant, that's different.

3345
02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:04.754
SAM: A monkey chant?
MARISHA: Yeah.

3346
02:04:04.754 --> 02:04:06.020
LIAM: (gorilla grunt)

3347
02:04:06.020 --> 02:04:07.029
TALIESIN: Good callback.

3348
02:04:07.029 --> 02:04:09.950
TRAVIS: Like a monk apostrophe Y or a monkey chant?

3349
02:04:09.950 --> 02:04:14.950
MARISHA: No, like a monkey, but I
appreciate that as well, yeah.

3350
02:04:14.950 --> 02:04:17.860
SAM: But isn't there-- I've heard or read or whatever,

3351
02:04:17.860 --> 02:04:19.420
don't you have to say a word

3352
02:04:19.420 --> 02:04:20.520
over and over to lull yourself--

3353
02:04:20.520 --> 02:04:22.190
ASHLEY: I think that's called something else.

3354
02:04:22.190 --> 02:04:24.430
TALIESIN: That's something else.
MARISHA: I mean, there's many ways

3355
02:04:24.430 --> 02:04:27.912
of meditation. There's no real right way.

3356
02:04:27.912 --> 02:04:30.810
It depends on what works best

3357
02:04:30.810 --> 02:04:32.750
for you and your inner peace.

3358
02:04:32.750 --> 02:04:34.440
SAM: All right, take us through it.

3359
02:04:34.440 --> 02:04:37.520
LAURA: I'm going to-- hold on, before we do this,

3360
02:04:38.360 --> 02:04:43.320
I'm going to cast Enhance Ability at third level

3361
02:04:45.410 --> 02:04:46.460
on Nott.

3362
02:04:47.690 --> 02:04:48.911
TALIESIN: Guidance.

3363
02:04:48.911 --> 02:04:51.040
TRAVIS and MARISHA: (laughter)

3364
02:04:51.040 --> 02:04:53.890
LAURA: And also myself because the
whole time we're doing this,

3365
02:04:53.890 --> 02:04:58.020
I'm keeping an eye out for anything coming through the mist.

3366
02:04:58.020 --> 02:04:59.620
MATT: Okay.
ASHLEY: I'm watching as well.

3367
02:04:59.620 --> 02:05:01.790
MATT: Enhance Ability on which ability?

3368
02:05:01.790 --> 02:05:03.910
LAURA: Owl's Wisdom.
MATT: Okay, you got it.

3369
02:05:03.910 --> 02:05:05.340
MARISHA: Fucking Thaddeus.

3370
02:05:05.340 --> 02:05:06.915
MATT: Make a perception check.

3371
02:05:08.844 --> 02:05:10.879
LAURA: Advantage.
MATT: Mm-hmm.

3372
02:05:13.040 --> 02:05:14.212
LAURA: Guide me.

3373
02:05:15.290 --> 02:05:18.075
Ooh hoo! That's good.

3374
02:05:20.840 --> 02:05:22.130
25.

3375
02:05:22.130 --> 02:05:25.160
MATT: 25, you're keeping watch on them.

3376
02:05:25.160 --> 02:05:29.700
The heavy cluster of these undead that had found you.

3377
02:05:29.700 --> 02:05:32.350
It's taken a long time, like the past hour and a half or so

3378
02:05:32.350 --> 02:05:33.700
that you guys have been waiting and talking

3379
02:05:33.700 --> 02:05:36.780
and catching up a bit. They've been slowly dissipating.

3380
02:05:36.780 --> 02:05:39.005
There's maybe a handful that are visible

3381
02:05:39.005 --> 02:05:41.153
about maybe a hundred feet away or more

3382
02:05:41.153 --> 02:05:43.500
and even then, just barely through the mist

3383
02:05:43.500 --> 02:05:45.110
and only because you rolled so high.

3384
02:05:45.110 --> 02:05:46.540
But you don't see any immediate danger,

3385
02:05:46.540 --> 02:05:47.890
you haven't drawn any immediate attention,

3386
02:05:47.890 --> 02:05:49.540
and for the time being, you feel safe.

3387
02:05:51.160 --> 02:05:52.810
Are you going to guide them through a meditation?

3388
02:05:53.750 --> 02:05:56.340
MARISHA: Everyone lay on your back.
LAURA: Oh, we're laying down?

3389
02:05:56.340 --> 02:05:57.833
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going this way.

3390
02:05:57.833 --> 02:05:59.487
I'm going to do, yeah.
LAURA: I'm going to sit.

3391
02:05:59.487 --> 02:06:00.470
I'm going to sit so I can keep watch.

3392
02:06:00.470 --> 02:06:02.670
SAM: Close eyes, open eyes?
MARISHA: Close your eyes.

3393
02:06:04.330 --> 02:06:06.500
Just being to focus on your breathing.

3394
02:06:06.500 --> 02:06:07.980
LAURA: I feel itchy.
MARISHA: No, don't,

3395
02:06:07.980 --> 02:06:10.330
you push it out--
SAM: You are the worst.

3396
02:06:10.330 --> 02:06:11.505
MARISHA: --of your brain.

3397
02:06:12.500 --> 02:06:16.910
Try not to move, try not to touch anything.

3398
02:06:17.990 --> 02:06:21.530
Just try to release.
LIAM: I am thinking

3399
02:06:21.530 --> 02:06:23.830
so many things now--
MARISHA: Stop, shut up, Caleb.

3400
02:06:23.830 --> 02:06:26.435
God fucking, all right.

3401
02:06:26.435 --> 02:06:27.702
TRAVIS: (zombie groan)

3402
02:06:27.702 --> 02:06:29.230
MARISHA: (sighing)

3403
02:06:29.230 --> 02:06:32.015
(loudly) Ignore the fucking undead, okay?
ALL: (shushing)

3404
02:06:32.015 --> 02:06:33.680
MARISHA: Sorry, sorry.
LAURA: Ball bearing.

3405
02:06:33.680 --> 02:06:36.332
SAM: This is the perfect place to meditate.

3406
02:06:37.990 --> 02:06:39.300
TRAVIS: I don't know what it looks like,

3407
02:06:39.300 --> 02:06:42.210
but even with my eyes closed, this is so great.

3408
02:06:43.244 --> 02:06:44.420
LIAM: You see it from 500 feet

3409
02:06:44.420 --> 02:06:47.182
and there's just-- they're closing in--

3410
02:06:47.182 --> 02:06:48.144
(laughter)

3411
02:06:48.144 --> 02:06:50.814
LIAM: --on this little glass ball.

3412
02:06:50.814 --> 02:06:53.520
MATT: This is the weirdest 28 Days
Later reboot I've ever seen.

3413
02:06:53.520 --> 02:06:55.614
TRAVIS: Just laying on the ground.

3414
02:06:55.614 --> 02:06:56.730
(groaning)

3415
02:06:56.730 --> 02:06:57.980
MATT: We'll say--
LIAM: Namaste.

3416
02:06:57.980 --> 02:06:58.880
MARISHA: And I lead them through

3417
02:06:58.880 --> 02:07:00.540
a guided meditation.
MATT: You do.

3418
02:07:00.540 --> 02:07:02.000
And you know what?

3419
02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.170
Who here doesn't have a point of exhaustion?

3420
02:07:05.670 --> 02:07:07.310
MARISHA: Doesn't?
LIAM: Does not, right?

3421
02:07:07.310 --> 02:07:08.468
ASHLEY: I do.
LAURA: You do.

3422
02:07:08.468 --> 02:07:09.758
MATT: All right.
ASHLEY: I don't know

3423
02:07:09.758 --> 02:07:10.750
where it came from, though.
MATT: Caleb and Jester,

3424
02:07:10.750 --> 02:07:12.583
it is a very nice guided meditation.

3425
02:07:12.583 --> 02:07:16.220
It is weirdly calming for you, very challenging for you

3426
02:07:16.220 --> 02:07:18.000
for the continuous amount of information

3427
02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:18.833
that's going through your head,

3428
02:07:18.833 --> 02:07:21.210
but you do find a few moments of clarity.

3429
02:07:21.210 --> 02:07:22.920
You finish the meditation, you both

3430
02:07:22.920 --> 02:07:25.270
open your eyes, and that was really peaceful.

3431
02:07:25.270 --> 02:07:26.645
Everyone else is dead asleep.

3432
02:07:26.645 --> 02:07:28.240
(laughter)

3433
02:07:28.240 --> 02:07:29.998
TRAVIS: I'm okay with that.
TALIESIN: I'm all right with that.

3434
02:07:29.998 --> 02:07:31.980
MARISHA: (sighs) Did your spirit animal come to you?

3435
02:07:31.980 --> 02:07:34.700
Did you have a vision, did you--?

3436
02:07:34.700 --> 02:07:36.290
TRAVIS: Who you talking to? We're all fucking out.

3437
02:07:36.290 --> 02:07:37.666
MARISHA: I was talking to them.
LAURA: Are you awake? Are you awake?

3438
02:07:37.666 --> 02:07:41.160
MARISHA: Well, I guided the meditation,
so I'm assuming I am. (laughs)

3439
02:07:41.160 --> 02:07:42.510
MATT: Yeah.
TRAVIS: It's a marsh, I was out.

3440
02:07:42.510 --> 02:07:44.420
MARISHA: Yep.
MATT: Yep. (laughs)

3441
02:07:44.420 --> 02:07:45.350
TRAVIS: Tickles.

3442
02:07:45.350 --> 02:07:47.720
MATT: Because you know this space well, you weren't--

3443
02:07:47.720 --> 02:07:49.470
you weren't taken by the meditation to put you to sleep.

3444
02:07:49.470 --> 02:07:50.792
TRAVIS: Sha-ka!

3445
02:07:50.792 --> 02:07:52.220
(laughter)

3446
02:07:52.220 --> 02:07:53.483
SAM: Nice cover.

3447
02:07:53.483 --> 02:07:54.997
(laughter)

3448
02:07:54.997 --> 02:07:57.241
SAM: What was that sound supposed to be?

3449
02:07:57.241 --> 02:07:59.090
TRAVIS: (laughs) Like how to tickle.

3450
02:07:59.090 --> 02:08:01.740
MATT: The meditation, successful, was nice.

3451
02:08:01.740 --> 02:08:04.680
Eventually, you find yourselves to a comfortable rest

3452
02:08:04.680 --> 02:08:06.440
for the night within the safety of this dome,

3453
02:08:06.440 --> 02:08:09.180
hopefully for the length of time that it remains

3454
02:08:09.180 --> 02:08:10.910
as it is an eight hour dome and you spent the first

3455
02:08:10.910 --> 02:08:13.671
two hours of it talking and going through this meditation.

3456
02:08:13.671 --> 02:08:16.040
LAURA: Oh Jesus.
MATT: But that should be fine.

3457
02:08:16.880 --> 02:08:18.470
As you find yourselves asleep in

3458
02:08:18.470 --> 02:08:20.480
the middle of the darkened mist-covered--

3459
02:08:20.480 --> 02:08:21.350
LAURA: Wait.
MATT: --swamp...

3460
02:08:21.350 --> 02:08:23.040
LAURA: One last thing.
MATT: Yes?

3461
02:08:23.040 --> 02:08:28.040
LAURA: As we're going to sleep, I
just want to apologize, Caleb.

3462
02:08:28.134 --> 02:08:31.130
I mean, I just want you to know that

3463
02:08:31.130 --> 02:08:33.590
I would never use anything to modify a memory

3464
02:08:33.590 --> 02:08:36.690
on you or Yasha or anyone that...

3465
02:08:39.500 --> 02:08:40.333
that we know.

3466
02:08:40.333 --> 02:08:44.185
You know, I know what it means.

3467
02:08:47.010 --> 02:08:47.843
LIAM: Well...

3468
02:08:52.452 --> 02:08:55.530
it's a tricky thing and it's all about

3469
02:08:55.530 --> 02:08:58.027
what you do with it, really.
LAURA: Yeah.

3470
02:08:59.060 --> 02:09:02.790
LIAM: And you did a good thing.
LAURA: Yeah.

3471
02:09:02.790 --> 02:09:05.490
LIAM: You made her happier.
LAURA: I think so.

3472
02:09:05.490 --> 02:09:09.550
LIAM: And it sounds like you made your new friend

3473
02:09:09.550 --> 02:09:10.816
happier as well.

3474
02:09:11.833 --> 02:09:14.216
LAURA: (laughs) Yeah.

3475
02:09:14.216 --> 02:09:16.786
(gentle music)

3476
02:09:18.210 --> 02:09:19.754
Okay.

3477
02:09:19.754 --> 02:09:21.290
I just wanted to make sure.

3478
02:09:24.820 --> 02:09:27.640
LIAM: Good night, Jester.
LAURA: Good night, Caleb.

3479
02:09:27.640 --> 02:09:29.740
(gentle music)

3480
02:09:29.740 --> 02:09:33.212
MATT: Under the dull moonlight against the

3481
02:09:33.212 --> 02:09:36.638
now relatively still marsh waters that rest around here,

3482
02:09:36.638 --> 02:09:40.327
the darkened dome visible,

3483
02:09:41.520 --> 02:09:43.510
you all find a night's rest.

3484
02:09:43.510 --> 02:09:44.549
We're going to go take a break.

3485
02:09:44.549 --> 02:09:45.524
(whooping)

3486
02:09:45.524 --> 02:09:47.200
TRAVIS: Long rest, baby, you gimme dat.

3487
02:09:47.200 --> 02:09:48.730
MATT: You did, you got yourself a long rest.

3488
02:09:48.730 --> 02:09:52.460
I, I think, knocked over-- there it is,

3489
02:09:52.460 --> 02:09:54.230
my information sheet for the giveaway tonight.

3490
02:09:54.230 --> 02:09:57.294
We have our giveaway tonight

3491
02:09:57.294 --> 02:10:00.930
from our friends at Wyrmwood Gaming.

3492
02:10:00.930 --> 02:10:02.930
We're giving away the Valentine's Day Vault,

3493
02:10:02.930 --> 02:10:04.540
which includes a custom transcription,

3494
02:10:04.540 --> 02:10:07.317
transcwiption, in Quenya Elvish.

3495
02:10:08.322 --> 02:10:09.422
So we got, I guess, two of these

3496
02:10:09.422 --> 02:10:11.090
to give away on that, which is kind of rad.

3497
02:10:12.140 --> 02:10:13.830
You can order it now until February 8th,

3498
02:10:13.830 --> 02:10:16.580
so very soon, little window, at wyrmwoodgaming.com

3499
02:10:16.580 --> 02:10:18.670
to receive it by Valentine's Day if you're looking to

3500
02:10:18.670 --> 02:10:20.730
give one of these to a present and a special someone.

3501
02:10:20.730 --> 02:10:23.460
So you got two days to get it in time.

3502
02:10:23.460 --> 02:10:24.600
The keyword.

02:10:24.600 --> 02:10:26.760
Remember, you can only enter it once in chat.

3504
02:10:26.760 --> 02:10:28.970
Entering it more than once will disqualify you guys.

3505
02:10:30.084 --> 02:10:33.280
Once again, it's for US and Canada only, excluding Quebec

3506
02:10:33.280 --> 02:10:37.058
because of challenging laws.
TRAVIS: Hey.

3507
02:10:37.058 --> 02:10:39.149
MATT: But yeah, the word tonight is cupcake.

3508
02:10:39.149 --> 02:10:40.681
(laughter)

3509
02:10:40.681 --> 02:10:44.020
MARISHA: There you go.
MATT: C-U-P-C-A-K-E, cupcake.

3510
02:10:44.020 --> 02:10:46.240

(bluesy guitar music)

3553
02:13:38.260 --> 02:13:40.700
BRIAN (V.O.): Last time on Talks Machina.

3554
02:13:40.700 --> 02:13:43.510
BRIAN: "We saw your face journeys, but can you talk about

3555
02:13:43.510 --> 02:13:46.380
"your train of thought as Laura Bailey

3556
02:13:46.380 --> 02:13:50.070
"once again proved she is the bestest at haggling?"

3557
02:13:50.070 --> 02:13:52.123
ASHLEY: It took awhile to realize what she was doing,

3558
02:13:52.123 --> 02:13:53.680
but then when we did, we were like, "There's no way"--

3559
02:13:53.680 --> 02:13:55.980
TALIESIN: I didn't-- I genuinely
didn't know what she was doing

3560
02:13:55.980 --> 02:13:58.060
until the-- so I was like, "Is this a bit?

3561
02:13:58.060 --> 02:13:59.940
"Are you just doing a bit, is this?"

3562
02:13:59.940 --> 02:14:02.490
Ah yeah, and then, that spell--

3563
02:14:02.490 --> 02:14:03.323
BRIAN: Did you think she was

3564
02:14:03.323 --> 02:14:05.350
going to really give up her hands?

3565
02:14:05.350 --> 02:14:06.370
I thought she was going to give up her hands--

3566
02:14:06.370 --> 02:14:07.760
ASHLEY: For a second, I was like--
BRIAN: I was like, "She must have

3567
02:14:07.760 --> 02:14:10.340
"some spell where she could grow them back?"

3568
02:14:10.340 --> 02:14:15.080
ASHLEY: Jester does shit that
you're like, "How did you even?

3569
02:14:15.080 --> 02:14:17.490
"You're so impulsive and you do things..."

3570
02:14:17.490 --> 02:14:19.840
Like, it wouldn't have surprised me if she did it.

3571
02:14:19.840 --> 02:14:21.890
TALIESIN: It was so, it was so clutch, too.

3572
02:14:21.890 --> 02:14:23.860
It was so fucking crazy.
ASHLEY: It was so cool.

3573
02:14:23.860 --> 02:14:25.990
BRIAN: She's playing some long cons this campaign for sure.

3574
02:14:25.990 --> 02:14:26.870
ASHLEY: Yes.

3575
02:14:27.950 --> 02:14:29.840
TALIESIN: Every now and then you
see somebody in one of these games

3576
02:14:29.840 --> 02:14:31.920
just do something so off the fucking wall.

3577
02:14:31.920 --> 02:14:33.350
And it was so off the fucking wall.

3578
02:14:33.350 --> 02:14:38.350
ASHLEY: And she used Modify Memory in such a positive way,

3579
02:14:38.940 --> 02:14:42.020
which is what was so cool. It was just so delightful,

3580
02:14:42.020 --> 02:14:44.220
and then just, like, now the hag is like,

3581
02:14:44.220 --> 02:14:46.460
"Oh, I got a buddy now and I wonder where she is.

3582
02:14:46.460 --> 02:14:47.760
"I just want to hang out with her."

3583
02:14:47.760 --> 02:14:48.593
I mean, who knows?

3584
02:14:48.593 --> 02:14:49.426
Maybe in the future, it won't--

3585
02:14:49.426 --> 02:14:50.984
TALIESIN: That's going to come back to haunt us.
ASHLEY: It's going to come back.

3586
02:14:50.984 --> 02:14:52.447
BRIAN: Yeah, because Matt--
TALIESIN: That's come back to haunt us.

3587
02:14:52.447 --> 02:14:54.530
BRIAN: Matt even did one of those, you know,

3588
02:14:54.530 --> 02:14:57.010
things where he says, "Yeah," but, you know,

3589
02:14:57.010 --> 02:14:59.630
and he's smiling while he does it that makes me think--

3590
02:14:59.630 --> 02:15:01.120
ASHLEY: But in the moment.
BRIAN: "Oof."

3591
02:15:01.120 --> 02:15:03.420
But in the moment, yeah, it was incredible

3592
02:15:03.420 --> 02:15:05.690
to see that's what she chose to do

3593
02:15:05.690 --> 02:15:08.790
instead of, yeah, it was baffling.

3594
02:15:08.790 --> 02:15:10.250
Instead of--
ASHLEY: Ugh, it was so good!

3595
02:15:10.250 --> 02:15:12.540
BRIAN: You do often see Modify Memory used

3596
02:15:12.540 --> 02:15:14.450
not that way and I thought that, yeah.

3597
02:15:14.450 --> 02:15:15.390
ASHLEY: Yeah.
BRIAN: Yeah, yeah.

3598
02:15:15.390 --> 02:15:16.900
You're right, yeah.
ASHLEY: It was so good

3599
02:15:16.900 --> 02:15:20.370
and the cupcake, it was just like, ah, it was so good.

3600
02:15:20.370 --> 02:15:22.770
TALIESIN: It was a-- perfect. It was perfect.

3601
02:15:22.770 --> 02:15:27.500
BRIAN: As people went in and out of
Isharnai's cabin-- how'd I do?

3602
02:15:27.500 --> 02:15:29.810
DANI: Good, right.
BRIAN: I'm awesome.

3603
02:15:29.810 --> 02:15:30.920
You looked like you had a plan

3604
02:15:30.920 --> 02:15:33.118
but you didn't get to act on it.

3605
02:15:33.118 --> 02:15:35.920
TALIESIN: The best I came up with,
I came up with the idea of

3606
02:15:37.170 --> 02:15:42.170
Clay was thinking of offering to never go home again.

3607
02:15:42.360 --> 02:15:43.950
ASHLEY: Oh.

3608
02:15:43.950 --> 02:15:44.970
BRIAN: Whoa.

3609
02:15:44.970 --> 02:15:47.020
TALIESIN: So still save everything.

3610
02:15:47.020 --> 02:15:48.250
DANI: Yeah, but just never see it.

3611
02:15:48.250 --> 02:15:50.460
TALIESIN: But just be like, "I agree to never,

3612
02:15:51.855 --> 02:15:54.330
"that once it's up, it's fine."

3613
02:15:54.330 --> 02:15:57.270
That's rough.
BRIAN: That's rough, buddy.

3614
02:15:57.270 --> 02:16:01.090
TALIESIN: Didn't have to do it, so.
BRIAN: Goddamn.

3615
02:16:01.090 --> 02:16:03.860
"How did it feel for Yasha to be told

3616
02:16:03.860 --> 02:16:07.210
"she was already too miserable to make a bargain with?

3617
02:16:07.210 --> 02:16:09.740
"Does Yasha agree that she is the bottom of the barrel

3618
02:16:09.740 --> 02:16:12.270
"or has she found some happiness with her friends?"

3619
02:16:12.270 --> 02:16:14.907
ASHLEY: I think she would agree with that

3620
02:16:16.875 --> 02:16:19.370
and I think it was almost good for her to hear that,

3621
02:16:19.370 --> 02:16:22.837
of like, "You're the bottom of the barrel right now."

3622
02:16:24.536 --> 02:16:27.240
(inhales) I do think she's slowly

3623
02:16:27.240 --> 02:16:31.370
finding happiness with her friends

3624
02:16:31.370 --> 02:16:32.790
and sort of getting comfortable

3625
02:16:32.790 --> 02:16:34.480
with those relationships again.

3626
02:16:34.480 --> 02:16:38.210
I think the conversation with Caleb

3627
02:16:39.810 --> 02:16:41.080
was nice to, I mean,

3628
02:16:43.520 --> 02:16:44.450
to sort of have

3629
02:16:46.460 --> 02:16:47.860
a companion in

3630
02:16:49.470 --> 02:16:50.340
misery.

3631
02:16:50.340 --> 02:16:52.090
BRIAN: "When communing with the Wildmother,

3632
02:16:52.090 --> 02:16:53.770
"Caduceus received confirmation that

3633
02:16:53.770 --> 02:16:56.370
"his family indeed is at the menagerie.

3634
02:16:56.370 --> 02:17:00.400
"However, Matt described this
response having less intensity.

3635
02:17:00.400 --> 02:17:02.220
"How did Caduceus interpret this?"

3636
02:17:02.220 --> 02:17:05.010
TALIESIN: Not all of them are there.
BRIAN: Okay.

3637
02:17:05.010 --> 02:17:06.250
Just--
TALIESIN: That was his immediate

3638
02:17:06.250 --> 02:17:09.562
thought is it's just one or two of them, not everybody.

3639
02:17:11.050 --> 02:17:12.502
Probably one, but.

3640
02:17:14.410 --> 02:17:17.160
But that was how I interpreted it, anyway.

3641
02:17:17.160 --> 02:17:19.800
BRIAN: And how did he feel about this news?

3642
02:17:21.850 --> 02:17:24.550
TALIESIN: Relieved and also
embarrassed that he bothered to ask.

3643
02:17:24.550 --> 02:17:26.080
It was one of those things where you shouldn't ask.

3644
02:17:26.080 --> 02:17:27.845
This is not the sort of thing you ask.

3645
02:17:27.845 --> 02:17:31.150
That's a sign of cowardice.

3646
02:17:31.150 --> 02:17:32.950
BRIAN: "Yasha made up her mind very quickly

3647
02:17:32.950 --> 02:17:35.070
"to enter the hag's home to make a deal.

3648
02:17:35.070 --> 02:17:37.500
"What was her thought process while listening to

3649
02:17:37.500 --> 02:17:41.070
"Beau speak about the deal she wanted to make?"

3650
02:17:41.070 --> 02:17:44.078
ASHLEY: I didn't necessarily see
it as one-upping each other,

3651
02:17:44.078 --> 02:17:46.030
but I get that, but I think all of us were like,

3652
02:17:46.030 --> 02:17:47.820
"No, I'm not going to let you do that.

3653
02:17:47.820 --> 02:17:50.850
"I can give up something, you can't,

3654
02:17:50.850 --> 02:17:53.773
"but I can because you're more important."

3655
02:17:55.100 --> 02:17:57.864
But I think it was just sort of--

3656
02:17:57.864 --> 02:17:58.822
HENRY: (barking)

3657
02:17:58.822 --> 02:18:00.780
ASHLEY: Oh!
BRIAN: It's Marisha!

3658
02:18:00.780 --> 02:18:04.780
ASHLEY: Speaking of!
BRIAN: He's excited to see Marisha.

3659
02:18:04.780 --> 02:18:06.953
MARISHA: I was going to--
ASHLEY: It was a slow walk.

3660
02:18:06.953 --> 02:18:08.050
MARISHA: -- stealthily--
BRIAN: You can't

3661
02:18:08.050 --> 02:18:10.810
sneak out stealthily from that dog.

3662
02:18:10.810 --> 02:18:12.290
ASHLEY: You rolled low on that stealth.

3663
02:18:12.290 --> 02:18:14.220
BRIAN: Yeah, that was a natural one.

3664
02:18:14.220 --> 02:18:15.240
DANI: A natural one.

3665
02:18:15.240 --> 02:18:18.120
BRIAN: "What do you make of Jester leaning into

3666
02:18:18.120 --> 02:18:21.850
"the more serious side of the Trickery domain as this was

3667
02:18:21.850 --> 02:18:26.320
"a masterful display of subterfuge against a powerful being

3668
02:18:26.320 --> 02:18:28.950
"rather than just one of her innocent pranks?"

3669
02:18:28.950 --> 02:18:30.550
TALIESIN: I feel like the innocent pranks are already

3670
02:18:30.550 --> 02:18:32.560
covering for the masterful subterfuge.

3671
02:18:32.560 --> 02:18:34.760
I think it's all a grand scheme, personally.

3672
02:18:34.760 --> 02:18:38.020
ASHLEY: Yeah, I feel like-- I mean, we don't

3673
02:18:38.020 --> 02:18:40.500
fully know what happened in there yet.

3674
02:18:40.500 --> 02:18:42.270
TALIESIN: No, we actually, the characters have no--

3675
02:18:42.270 --> 02:18:43.103
ASHLEY: The characters don't.

3676
02:18:43.103 --> 02:18:44.730
TALIESIN: She literally just, she just ran out of there

3677
02:18:44.730 --> 02:18:46.780
like somebody running out of 7-11

3678
02:18:46.780 --> 02:18:47.890
going, "Don't ask questions."

3679
02:18:47.890 --> 02:18:48.740
ASHLEY: Start the car.
TALIESIN: Start the car.

3680
02:18:48.740 --> 02:18:50.820
Let's go, we're going right now, right now.

3681
02:18:50.820 --> 02:18:52.082
Don't ask.
ASHLEY: No, we're not leaving.

3682
02:18:52.082 --> 02:18:53.689
TALIESIN: Don't look back.
BRIAN: No, we're not leaving him, no.

3683
02:18:53.689 --> 02:18:54.522
TALIESIN: Oh Henry.

3684
02:18:54.522 --> 02:18:55.355
ASHLEY: Henry.

3685
02:18:55.355 --> 02:18:57.145
TALIESIN: Henry?
BRIAN: He's, I feel like--

3686
02:18:57.145 --> 02:18:58.261
TALIESIN: Don't go over there, that's something special.

3687
02:18:58.261 --> 02:18:59.930
BRIAN: There's a cop hiding somewhere in here.

3688
02:18:59.930 --> 02:19:01.420
He's been trying to sniff him out for me.

3689
02:19:01.420 --> 02:19:02.290
I trained him to sniff out cops.

3690
02:19:02.290 --> 02:19:03.980
TALIESIN: There's a cop hiding in all of us.

3691
02:19:03.980 --> 02:19:04.813
ASHLEY: Sit.
TALIESIN: Truly,

3692
02:19:04.813 --> 02:19:05.990
when you think about it.
BRIAN: That's true.

3693
02:19:05.990 --> 02:19:07.854
ASHLEY: Sit, thank you.
BRIAN: The Cop Inside Me?

3694
02:19:07.854 --> 02:19:11.066
I read that book.
TALIESIN: Changed my life.

3695
02:19:11.066 --> 02:19:13.816
(dramatic music)

3696
02:19:16.141 --> 02:19:16.974
(cheering)

3697
02:19:16.974 --> 02:19:18.240
(whooping)

3698
02:19:18.240 --> 02:19:21.490
SAM: Yeah, we did it, yeah!
DANI: Sam Riegel,

3699
02:19:21.490 --> 02:19:23.640
you just won the Super Bowl, what're you going to do now?

3700
02:19:23.640 --> 02:19:26.770
SAM: I'm subscribing to Critical Role, yeah!

3701
02:19:26.770 --> 02:19:29.440
DANI: Beautiful, and that's--
SAM: It's about perseverance,

3702
02:19:29.440 --> 02:19:31.070
like remembering to resubscribe

3703
02:19:31.070 --> 02:19:33.082
with Twitch Prime every month,

3704
02:19:33.082 --> 02:19:34.107
yeah, ho ho ho ho.
DANI: Yes!

3705
02:19:34.107 --> 02:19:35.323
Well, could you--
SAM: Have done it

3706
02:19:35.323 --> 02:19:36.280
without my teammates?

3707
02:19:36.280 --> 02:19:37.995
Come on, no way!

3708
02:19:37.995 --> 02:19:39.300
And they couldn't have done it without the

3709
02:19:39.300 --> 02:19:42.490
Twitch subscriptions that I gave them, right, guys?

3710
02:19:42.490 --> 02:19:45.002
Yeah!
DANI: Okay, Sam, but what about--

3711
02:19:45.002 --> 02:19:47.730
SAM: What about what inspires me, you mean?

3712
02:19:47.730 --> 02:19:49.770
Well, Yee-Haw Game Ranch really does.

3713
02:19:49.770 --> 02:19:53.080
I mean, watching that dehydrated piece of string cheese

3714
02:19:53.080 --> 02:19:55.310
Brian Foster every couple weeks

3715
02:19:55.310 --> 02:19:57.690
really gets me pumped for the big game. (laughs)

3716
02:19:57.690 --> 02:19:59.290
DANI: Sam, hold on, we have to--

3717
02:19:59.290 --> 02:20:00.262
(air horn blowing)

3718
02:20:00.262 --> 02:20:01.487
SAM: You can't believe it?

3719
02:20:01.487 --> 02:20:02.750
You can't believe it, is that what you said?

3720
02:20:02.750 --> 02:20:05.430
Well, it's true because every Yee-Haw VOD

3721
02:20:05.430 --> 02:20:07.660
is instantly available as soon as

3722
02:20:07.660 --> 02:20:09.348
you subscribe. It's amazing.

3723
02:20:09.348 --> 02:20:10.645
DANI: Sam!
SAM: We did it, guys.

3724
02:20:10.645 --> 02:20:12.435
DANI: Sam!
SAM: Yeah, yeah!

3725
02:20:12.435 --> 02:20:13.443
DANI: Sam!
SAM: Yeah!

3726
02:20:13.443 --> 02:20:14.650
What? Sorry.
DANI: Just say,

3727
02:20:14.650 --> 02:20:16.120
"I'm going to Disneyland."

3728
02:20:16.120 --> 02:20:18.230
You're doing a commercial for Disneyland.

3729
02:20:18.230 --> 02:20:19.063
SAM: Oh.

3730
02:20:20.020 --> 02:20:21.601
Uh.

3731
02:20:21.601 --> 02:20:22.930
(squirting)

3732
02:20:22.930 --> 02:20:24.358
What's a Disneyland?

3733
02:20:24.358 --> 02:20:26.363
(explosion)
(dramatic music)

3734
02:20:26.363 --> 02:20:27.246
(whistle blowing)

3735
02:20:27.246 --> 02:20:30.840
(dramatic music)

3736
02:20:30.840 --> 02:20:32.620
SAM: I don't know, I got to be honest with you--

3737
02:20:32.620 --> 02:20:34.850
DANI: Oh!
SAM: I got hit in the head

3738
02:20:34.850 --> 02:20:37.180
pretty hard out there.
DANI: Oh my god.

3739
02:20:37.180 --> 02:20:40.211
SAM: Woo, uh, I'm not good at sports.

3740
02:20:40.211 --> 02:20:42.725
(thudding)
(crowd groaning)

3741
02:20:42.725 --> 02:20:43.891
(whooshing)

3742
02:20:43.891 --> 02:20:46.055
(cheering)

3743
02:20:46.055 --> 02:20:48.805
(fire whooshing)

3744
02:20:50.138 --> 02:20:54.938
(dramatic music)

3745
02:34:32.702 --> 02:34:33.535
MATT: And welcome back.

3746
02:34:33.535 --> 02:34:35.420
All righty, so we have our two winners

3747
02:34:35.420 --> 02:34:38.230
for the two pieces in our Wyrmwood giveaway

3748
02:34:38.230 --> 02:34:41.330
of these Valentine's Day inscripted bits.

3749
02:34:41.330 --> 02:34:45.120
The winners are thintheveil.
ALL: Ooh.

3750
02:34:45.120 --> 02:34:47.100
MATT: Congratulations, thintheveil.

3751
02:34:47.100 --> 02:34:50.304
And gamerjasmania.
SAM: Ooh!

3752
02:34:50.304 --> 02:34:52.890
MATT: Congratulations to the both of you.

3753
02:34:52.890 --> 02:34:55.311
We'll get those pieces sent out to you ASAP.

3754
02:34:55.311 --> 02:34:56.760
(paper rustling)

3755
02:34:56.760 --> 02:34:58.502
All righty.

3756
02:34:59.560 --> 02:35:02.985
So, Mighty Nein,

3757
02:35:02.985 --> 02:35:05.601
after a long rest is acquired,

3758
02:35:05.601 --> 02:35:07.570
the points of exhaustion of which those of you who

3759
02:35:07.570 --> 02:35:10.710
still maintain them, if you had just one, goes away.

3760
02:35:10.710 --> 02:35:13.540
I believe you all just have one point each.

3761
02:35:13.540 --> 02:35:17.410
But you awaken just as the dome vanishes.

3762
02:35:17.410 --> 02:35:19.890
You're awakened because as soon as it does,

3763
02:35:19.890 --> 02:35:24.890
the warm, comfortable interior and the not-as-terrible smell

3764
02:35:25.860 --> 02:35:28.240
suddenly vanishes and you find yourself

3765
02:35:28.240 --> 02:35:30.470
immediately exposed to the elements of the swamp

3766
02:35:30.470 --> 02:35:32.450
and (gasps) you all wake up as

3767
02:35:32.450 --> 02:35:35.190
the cold air and the mist, still burning off

3768
02:35:35.190 --> 02:35:39.773
in the early morning around you, greets you to the day.

3769
02:35:40.660 --> 02:35:42.820
LIAM: Early to bed, early to rise.
TALIESIN: Detect Undead.

3770
02:35:42.820 --> 02:35:43.653
MATT: Okay.

3771
02:35:45.596 --> 02:35:47.662
None.

3772
02:35:47.662 --> 02:35:48.662
LAURA: Oh.
TALIESIN: We're good.

3773
02:35:49.976 --> 02:35:51.300
MATT: For the time being, at least.

3774
02:35:51.300 --> 02:35:52.133
TALIESIN: Pa-pa-pa-pow.

3775
02:35:53.009 --> 02:35:54.727
(laughter)

3776
02:35:54.727 --> 02:35:57.150
LAURA: We should get out of here.
TALIESIN: We should get out of here.

3777
02:35:57.150 --> 02:35:58.466
LAURA: Caleb?
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>?

3778
02:35:58.466 --> 02:35:59.810
LAURA: I'm picking my spells.

3779
02:35:59.810 --> 02:36:02.990
Can you teleport us out or do I need to Find the Path?

3780
02:36:02.990 --> 02:36:05.990
LIAM: I think so, but I don't know that I can draw

3781
02:36:05.990 --> 02:36:08.620
upon the ground here.
TRAVIS: Oh, right.

3782
02:36:09.733 --> 02:36:12.095
TALIESIN: Maybe finding the path.
LIAM: So we may need to walk a little bit.

3783
02:36:12.095 --> 02:36:12.953
LAURA: Hold on.

3784
02:36:12.953 --> 02:36:14.411
Lemme see, hold on.

3785
02:36:14.411 --> 02:36:15.919
SAM: Wait, you could--
LAURA: Don't I have a shape--

3786
02:36:15.919 --> 02:36:19.960
SAM: You could paint a ground.

3787
02:36:19.960 --> 02:36:22.460
LAURA: I could paint a ground on the shitty ground?

3788
02:36:22.460 --> 02:36:24.011
SAM: You could paint a--
LAURA: Hold on, hold on, hold on.

3789
02:36:24.011 --> 02:36:26.670
SAM: -- breakdancing cardboard piece?

3790
02:36:28.158 --> 02:36:29.971
You know what I mean?
TALIESIN: I do.

3791
02:36:29.971 --> 02:36:32.546
LAURA: How much space do you need to make the circle?

3792
02:36:32.546 --> 02:36:34.871
LIAM: A 10-foot-diameter circle.

3793
02:36:34.871 --> 02:36:36.617
SAM: Big breakdance.

3794
02:36:36.617 --> 02:36:39.920
LAURA: Well, I could Stone Shape a couple times.

3795
02:36:39.920 --> 02:36:41.761
TALIESIN: Or we could just walk.

3796
02:36:41.761 --> 02:36:43.919
LAURA: Or we just walk out.

3797
02:36:43.919 --> 02:36:45.210
TALIESIN: We walked in.

3798
02:36:47.590 --> 02:36:52.590
LAURA: Maybe we walk until we get
to ground that you can draw on.

3799
02:36:52.680 --> 02:36:54.718
LIAM: Where do we want to go, again?

3800
02:36:54.718 --> 02:36:55.551
LAURA: I don't know.

3801
02:36:55.551 --> 02:36:57.334
MARISHA: I guess back the way we came?

3802
02:36:57.334 --> 02:36:58.191
LIAM: Well.

3803
02:36:58.191 --> 02:37:00.317
MARISHA: Do you think our horses are still alive?

3804
02:37:00.317 --> 02:37:03.130
LAURA: (gasps)
MARISHA: How do you think WCG there is doing?

3805
02:37:03.130 --> 02:37:04.360
LAURA: No, we sent them home, remember?

3806
02:37:04.360 --> 02:37:06.296
MARISHA: I know, but do you think they made it?

3807
02:37:06.296 --> 02:37:08.127
LAURA: No.
MARISHA: No, me neither.

3808
02:37:08.127 --> 02:37:09.962
(laughter)

3809
02:37:09.962 --> 02:37:12.649
TRAVIS: Not a fucking chance.

3810
02:37:12.649 --> 02:37:16.600
"Oh, I'll just stay under this tree at night." (growls)

3811
02:37:16.600 --> 02:37:17.433
MARISHA: (laughs)

3812
02:37:17.433 --> 02:37:19.340
LIAM: Well, they were disguised as moorbounders

3813
02:37:19.340 --> 02:37:21.290
dancing around like horses.
TRAVIS: Oh yes, that's true.

3814
02:37:21.290 --> 02:37:22.190
MATT: Yep.
MARISHA: For how long?

3815
02:37:22.190 --> 02:37:24.442
SAM: An hour or something.

3816
02:37:24.442 --> 02:37:26.192
LIAM: No, it was eight hours. Seeming.
MATT: Eight hours.

3817
02:37:26.192 --> 02:37:27.306
MARISHA: Eight hours?
MATT: Yep.

3818
02:37:27.306 --> 02:37:28.480
Seeming lasts a while.

3819
02:37:28.480 --> 02:37:29.405
No, not concentration.

3820
02:37:29.405 --> 02:37:30.238
TALIESIN: We could head that way and

3821
02:37:30.238 --> 02:37:32.260
see if there's anything left. (laughs)

3822
02:37:32.260 --> 02:37:33.535
MARISHA: Summons a scrap.

3823
02:37:33.535 --> 02:37:34.670
LAURA: They were--

3824
02:37:34.670 --> 02:37:36.210
ASHLEY: Or they got killed when they got into town

3825
02:37:36.210 --> 02:37:37.627
because they were like, "Ahh!"

3826
02:37:37.627 --> 02:37:39.140
(laughter)

3827
02:37:39.140 --> 02:37:41.184
TRAVIS: They made it all the way back.

3828
02:37:41.184 --> 02:37:43.260
(laughter)
TALIESIN: Hey!

3829
02:37:43.260 --> 02:37:44.214
LAURA: Oh no!

3830
02:37:44.214 --> 02:37:45.047
(laughter)

3831
02:37:45.047 --> 02:37:46.200
LAURA: That is so true.
SAM: Slay the beasts!

3832
02:37:46.200 --> 02:37:47.972
TRAVIS: Also, fair.

3833
02:37:47.972 --> 02:37:49.049
(laughter)

3834
02:37:49.049 --> 02:37:51.190
LIAM: Buttercup?!

3835
02:37:51.190 --> 02:37:53.532
LAURA: Oh no.
ASHLEY: It's okay.

3836
02:37:53.532 --> 02:37:55.307
TRAVIS: All right, let's move, take advantage of the light.

3837
02:37:55.307 --> 02:37:57.132
ASHLEY: They're beasts of the wild; they'll be fine.

3838
02:37:58.035 --> 02:37:59.720
SAM: Do we have to move quietly?

3839
02:37:59.720 --> 02:38:02.730
Or just go as fast as we fucking can?

3840
02:38:02.730 --> 02:38:05.230
MARISHA: Kind of want that to be the reality.

3841
02:38:05.230 --> 02:38:06.504
(laughter)

3842
02:38:06.504 --> 02:38:07.810
MARISHA: Just because it's so funny.

3843
02:38:07.810 --> 02:38:12.358
TRAVIS: Are we casting your path-locating
spell or just taking it?

3844
02:38:12.358 --> 02:38:15.460
LAURA: I mean, I guess I can prepare it.

3845
02:38:15.460 --> 02:38:17.030
Give me a second.

3846
02:38:17.030 --> 02:38:18.230
MATT: If you continue to traverse here,

3847
02:38:18.230 --> 02:38:20.260
we will begin doing a skill challenge.

3848
02:38:21.210 --> 02:38:22.690
SAM and TALIESIN: Oh, that's right.

3849
02:38:22.690 --> 02:38:23.880
MATT: If you're walking the rest of this path--

3850
02:38:23.880 --> 02:38:25.370
LAURA: That's why I was saying we should teleport.

3851
02:38:25.370 --> 02:38:27.680
TRAVIS: Can't draw it.
MATT: It's up to you.

3852
02:38:27.680 --> 02:38:30.320
Find the Path will help reduce the number

3853
02:38:30.320 --> 02:38:32.360
of successes required to make your way out.

3854
02:38:32.360 --> 02:38:33.440
LIAM: We are done with your family?

3855
02:38:33.440 --> 02:38:35.353
You don't need-- that's it for now?

3856
02:38:35.353 --> 02:38:36.400
MARISHA: Yep.

3857
02:38:36.400 --> 02:38:37.900
SAM: You don't need to go back?

3858
02:38:37.900 --> 02:38:39.483
MARISHA: For? I have no answers.

3859
02:38:39.483 --> 02:38:40.700
SAM: To kidnap your brother?

3860
02:38:40.700 --> 02:38:43.210
MARISHA: Not, I can't, not yet, I don't think.

3861
02:38:43.210 --> 02:38:47.493
I have nothing else to report, I don't think.

3862
02:38:50.433 --> 02:38:52.710
SAM: Okay, it's done.
MARISHA: Nothing I can't send in

3863
02:38:52.710 --> 02:38:55.060
a message through Jes.
LAURA: I can send a message.

3864
02:38:57.010 --> 02:38:58.190
TRAVIS: She was gesturing to you, so yeah.

3865
02:38:58.190 --> 02:38:59.023
LIAM: Yeah.

3866
02:39:00.320 --> 02:39:01.461
LAURA: Oh.

3867
02:39:01.461 --> 02:39:03.685
SAM: By the way--
LAURA: Then yeah, I could send a message.

3868
02:39:03.685 --> 02:39:05.626
SAM: That meditation stuff,

3869
02:39:05.626 --> 02:39:08.290
I mean, it felt a lot like sleep.

3870
02:39:08.290 --> 02:39:09.897
MARISHA: Yeah, you fell asleep.

3871
02:39:09.897 --> 02:39:11.693
(laughter)

3872
02:39:11.693 --> 02:39:13.420
TRAVIS: I didn't, I stayed awake.

3873
02:39:13.420 --> 02:39:15.040
MARISHA: We'll try again when we're--
LAURA: No, you fell asleep.

3874
02:39:15.040 --> 02:39:17.580
MARISHA: -- not so tapped.
SAM: Okay.

3875
02:39:17.580 --> 02:39:18.630
MARISHA: Yeah.

3876
02:39:19.505 --> 02:39:21.330
LAURA: Maybe for the time being,

3877
02:39:21.330 --> 02:39:22.830
you just practice being sober.

3878
02:39:25.510 --> 02:39:27.010
SAM: Okay.
MARISHA: How has that been?

3879
02:39:28.150 --> 02:39:30.290
Because I know you were doing all right

3880
02:39:30.290 --> 02:39:33.310
and then-- but I don't know if that's how--

3881
02:39:33.310 --> 02:39:36.310
SAM: I've been sneaking a lot of booze.

3882
02:39:36.310 --> 02:39:38.093
MARISHA: We've noticed.

3883
02:39:38.093 --> 02:39:38.990
SAM: Okay, okay.

3884
02:39:38.990 --> 02:39:40.744
I mean--
MARISHA: No, we know.

3885
02:39:40.744 --> 02:39:42.142
SAM: Cool, I mean--
MARISHA: Yeah.

3886
02:39:42.142 --> 02:39:43.700
SAM: It's been going great, then.

3887
02:39:44.601 --> 02:39:45.434
TALIESIN: (laughs)

3888
02:39:45.434 --> 02:39:46.710
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.
LIAM: We can often tell

3889
02:39:46.710 --> 02:39:48.260
because you get a little aggro.

3890
02:39:49.780 --> 02:39:51.500
SAM: What the fuck did you just say?!

3891
02:39:51.500 --> 02:39:52.591
I'm just kidding.

3892
02:39:52.591 --> 02:39:53.934
(laughter)

3893
02:39:53.934 --> 02:39:57.320
TRAVIS: Is it something you want us
to help remind you with or no?

3894
02:39:57.320 --> 02:39:58.920
SAM: No, I like to drink.
TRAVIS: Right.

3895
02:39:59.881 --> 02:40:01.550
MARISHA: Do you want us to help you with that?

3896
02:40:01.550 --> 02:40:04.220
SAM: But if I'm aiming for this meditation thing,

3897
02:40:04.220 --> 02:40:07.580
then I will do my best, so yes, if you catch me

3898
02:40:07.580 --> 02:40:09.570
taking a little nip, why don't--

3899
02:40:09.570 --> 02:40:13.372
Yasha, why don't you knock it out of my hand?

3900
02:40:14.740 --> 02:40:16.173
ASHLEY: Are you sure?

3901
02:40:16.173 --> 02:40:17.006
SAM: Yep.

3902
02:40:17.006 --> 02:40:19.600
MARISHA: Yasha's the only one with permission?

3903
02:40:19.600 --> 02:40:20.790
SAM: Yeah, yeah.

3904
02:40:20.790 --> 02:40:23.820
MARISHA: What if she doesn't notice and the rest of us do?

3905
02:40:23.820 --> 02:40:26.026
Are we allowed to tell her?
SAM: You can tell Yasha.

3906
02:40:26.026 --> 02:40:26.893
LAURA: Oh.

3907
02:40:26.893 --> 02:40:30.510
ASHLEY: Are you stopping entirely or are you

3908
02:40:30.510 --> 02:40:32.156
doing a taper thing?
TRAVIS: No, don't ask for clarification.

3909
02:40:32.156 --> 02:40:33.190
Wider is better.

3910
02:40:33.190 --> 02:40:35.190
Broad, broad.

3911
02:40:35.190 --> 02:40:37.320
ASHLEY: Any time you take a nip,
I knock it out of your hand?

3912
02:40:37.320 --> 02:40:39.390
SAM: Go ahead, I give you permission.

3913
02:40:39.390 --> 02:40:42.400
ASHLEY: What about if we go to a
tavern or something and you want

3914
02:40:42.400 --> 02:40:44.233
something to drink?
LAURA: Nope, nope. Knock it out.

3915
02:40:44.233 --> 02:40:46.366
SAM: Wait, taverns, too?

3916
02:40:46.366 --> 02:40:47.792
LAURA: Anywhere.

3917
02:40:47.792 --> 02:40:49.540
SAM: Oh shit.
LAURA: Booze is booze is booze.

3918
02:40:49.540 --> 02:40:50.881
SAM: All right.

3919
02:40:50.881 --> 02:40:53.656
LAURA: But a lot of taverns have decent milk.

3920
02:40:54.510 --> 02:40:57.470
SAM: I've seen the lumpy shit that you drink.

3921
02:40:57.470 --> 02:41:00.430
It's like stew, it's like dairy stew.

3922
02:41:00.430 --> 02:41:02.580
LAURA: I have a lot of--
ASHLEY: You could have some tea.

3923
02:41:02.580 --> 02:41:06.240
LAURA: I also have some dust of deliciousness left.

3924
02:41:06.240 --> 02:41:10.447
SAM: Okay, so you can make the curdled milk taste

3925
02:41:10.447 --> 02:41:11.638
like a cupcake?

3926
02:41:11.638 --> 02:41:12.680
LAURA: Yeah.

3927
02:41:12.680 --> 02:41:14.280
TALIESIN: Like butter.
SAM: All right. (laughs)

3928
02:41:14.280 --> 02:41:16.061
LIAM: New England clam chowder.

3929
02:41:16.061 --> 02:41:18.089
(groaning, gagging)
TRAVIS: All right.

3930
02:41:18.089 --> 02:41:19.966
(laughter)

3931
02:41:19.966 --> 02:41:24.317
SAM: A nice of shot of New England clam chowder.

3932
02:41:24.317 --> 02:41:26.840
TRAVIS: (gagging)

3933
02:41:26.840 --> 02:41:28.365
SAM: With tequila.

3934
02:41:29.210 --> 02:41:32.001
Beer and ranch dressing.
LIAM: That sounds good.

3935
02:41:32.001 --> 02:41:33.400
(laughter)

3936
02:41:33.400 --> 02:41:35.500
MATT: You saved yourself and you saved us all.

3937
02:41:37.022 --> 02:41:37.855
So what's the plan?

3938
02:41:37.855 --> 02:41:40.050
Are you guys traversing the way back?

3939
02:41:40.050 --> 02:41:42.630
LAURA: No, I am going to use Stone Shape.

3940
02:41:44.339 --> 02:41:45.172
MATT: Okay.

3941
02:41:45.172 --> 02:41:46.005
LAURA: I'm going to look for

3942
02:41:46.005 --> 02:41:50.360
a patch of ground that is, you know, good

3943
02:41:50.360 --> 02:41:53.410
and I'm going to make it nice and flat and

3944
02:41:54.280 --> 02:41:55.788
drawable for Caleb.

3945
02:41:55.788 --> 02:41:56.621
MATT: Okay.

3946
02:41:56.621 --> 02:41:58.380
Yeah, you can definitely do that with that spell.

3947
02:41:58.380 --> 02:41:59.440
You take a little bit of time,

3948
02:41:59.440 --> 02:42:02.080
keeping an eye out as well, setting up

3949
02:42:02.080 --> 02:42:05.020
this stone flatland platform

3950
02:42:05.020 --> 02:42:09.190
large enough to contain this circle of teleportation.

3951
02:42:10.600 --> 02:42:11.590
Easily enough, it's available to you.

3952
02:42:11.590 --> 02:42:14.690
You can begin the inscribing on the ground.

3953
02:42:14.690 --> 02:42:15.740
LIAM: Destination?

3954
02:42:17.570 --> 02:42:20.840
Anywhere, East or West?
LAURA: Where do you want to go?

3955
02:42:20.840 --> 02:42:22.650
LIAM: I don't care.
TRAVIS: The Menagerie.

3956
02:42:22.650 --> 02:42:25.010
Close to the Menagerie.

3957
02:42:25.010 --> 02:42:27.801
LAURA: Well, we can go to Yussa's.

3958
02:42:27.801 --> 02:42:28.664
LIAM: Mm hm.

3959
02:42:28.664 --> 02:42:30.200
Do you want to give him a heads up this time?

3960
02:42:30.200 --> 02:42:32.380
We could actually be responsible, for once.

3961
02:42:32.380 --> 02:42:34.330
SAM: Is that, weren't we going to--

3962
02:42:36.340 --> 02:42:38.080
LAURA: Caduceus.
SAM: To Caduceus'?

3963
02:42:38.080 --> 02:42:40.670
TALIESIN: That would be on the way,
that would be the way to do it.

3964
02:42:40.670 --> 02:42:42.570
SAM: On the way, well, I mean,

3965
02:42:42.570 --> 02:42:44.145
we're over here.

3966
02:42:44.145 --> 02:42:44.992
MARISHA: But I don't know if--

3967
02:42:44.992 --> 02:42:47.450
SAM: Menagerie is here and Yussa's over here, so--

3968
02:42:47.450 --> 02:42:49.540
MARISHA: But what he's saying I don't know if Caleb

3969
02:42:49.540 --> 02:42:53.293
knows any other closer teleportation circles past that.

3970
02:42:53.293 --> 02:42:58.280
SAM: But we can go to Rosohna and ask Essek to take us there

3971
02:42:58.280 --> 02:43:01.471
TALIESIN: Or we can get the ship.

3972
02:43:01.471 --> 02:43:02.737
LAURA: And go to your place

3973
02:43:02.737 --> 02:43:04.690
and then go do the meetup.
TALIESIN: Go to my place and then to yours.

3974
02:43:04.690 --> 02:43:05.523
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3975
02:43:05.523 --> 02:43:07.450
SAM: That's a lot of seafaring.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

3976
02:43:07.450 --> 02:43:09.963
SAM: That's three weeks of seafaring.
MARISHA: That sounds fucking awesome.

3977
02:43:09.963 --> 02:43:11.029
TALIESIN: That sounds great.
LAURA: We haven't been on a boat

3978
02:43:11.029 --> 02:43:12.204
in a long time, you guys.
SAM: We're just going to

3979
02:43:12.204 --> 02:43:13.630
go on a sail for three weeks?

3980
02:43:13.630 --> 02:43:14.600
Don't we have shit to do?

3981
02:43:14.600 --> 02:43:16.785
Don't you want to--
ASHLEY: Wait, but isn't the con coming up?

3982
02:43:16.785 --> 02:43:18.423
LAURA: I'm going to send a message

3983
02:43:18.423 --> 02:43:20.310
to Orly and see where they are.

3984
02:43:20.310 --> 02:43:22.020
SAM: You're right, but we'd be going down there.

3985
02:43:22.020 --> 02:43:23.303
ASHLEY: We'd be going down there anyway.

3986
02:43:23.303 --> 02:43:25.440
MARISHA: We did tell Orly to stay, right?

3987
02:43:25.440 --> 02:43:26.448
TALIESIN: We did.

3988
02:43:26.448 --> 02:43:28.323
MATT: You told Orly to hang around, I believe.

3989
02:43:28.323 --> 02:43:29.770
MARISHA: We were like: Hey Orly, don't go.

3990
02:43:29.770 --> 02:43:30.980
LIAM: Stay.
LAURA: We did?

3991
02:43:30.980 --> 02:43:31.900
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.
MARISHA: I think so.

3992
02:43:31.900 --> 02:43:33.670
LAURA: Okay nevermind, I'm not
going to send him a message, then.

3993
02:43:33.670 --> 02:43:36.477
MARISHA: Well, I mean, you could.

3994
02:43:36.477 --> 02:43:37.802
TRAVIS: We're right here, right?

3995
02:43:37.802 --> 02:43:38.667
SAM: Just to clarify--

3996
02:43:38.667 --> 02:43:41.460
MATT: Actually, north of Kamordah,
you're more up there, yeah.

3997
02:43:41.460 --> 02:43:42.930
TRAVIS: Okay, and the Menagerie's here?

3998
02:43:42.930 --> 02:43:46.538
LAURA: Yeah, but Nicodranas is down further, yeah.

3999
02:43:48.370 --> 02:43:52.310
SAM: And just so I'm clear, we, who right now

4000
02:43:52.310 --> 02:43:55.110
are near another destination that we had--

4001
02:43:55.110 --> 02:43:56.630
LAURA: Which is what?
SAM: Pride's Call.

4002
02:43:56.630 --> 02:43:58.860
There was another item on the to-do list.

4003
02:43:58.860 --> 02:44:00.766
MARISHA: No no no--
SAM: We are going to,

4004
02:44:00.766 --> 02:44:04.600
sure, sure, sure, but we're going to choose not to do that

4005
02:44:04.600 --> 02:44:05.680
and instead--
MARISHA: Well, we don't--

4006
02:44:05.680 --> 02:44:09.250
SAM: -- decide to go on a three week-long boat trip

4007
02:44:09.250 --> 02:44:11.300
to a place that we can get to in one day?

4008
02:44:11.300 --> 02:44:13.580
MARISHA: Well, we decided we
weren't going to do Pride's Call

4009
02:44:13.580 --> 02:44:15.210
because we decided we didn't need to--

4010
02:44:15.210 --> 02:44:18.620
SAM: That's fine, but even going to Caduceus' family,

4011
02:44:18.620 --> 02:44:20.160
we could get there in a day and a half

4012
02:44:20.160 --> 02:44:22.272
versus three weeks of boat trip.

4013
02:44:22.272 --> 02:44:23.840
TRAVIS: You mean, if we traverse all these mountains

4014
02:44:23.840 --> 02:44:24.673
and come down this way?

4015
02:44:24.673 --> 02:44:26.673
SAM: No, if we teleport

4016
02:44:26.673 --> 02:44:29.120
back to Xhorhas and ask Essek to just take us there.

4017
02:44:29.120 --> 02:44:31.730
MARISHA: Yeah, that's assuming
a lot from Essek, though, right?

4018
02:44:31.730 --> 02:44:33.700
TALIESIN: I don't know

4019
02:44:33.700 --> 02:44:35.500
if I want to keep burning favors.

4020
02:44:35.500 --> 02:44:37.180
I'm happy to just take the journey,

4021
02:44:37.180 --> 02:44:38.450
I'm a believer in the journey.
SAM: He's our best bud.

4022
02:44:38.450 --> 02:44:40.170
LAURA: I can send him a message

4023
02:44:40.170 --> 02:44:41.830
and ask him if he can do it.
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's ask him.

4024
02:44:41.830 --> 02:44:44.778
I mean, we did help him

4025
02:44:44.778 --> 02:44:47.580
make an incredibly powerful spell.

4026
02:44:47.580 --> 02:44:48.490
Seems to be--
TALIESIN: I'm okay.

4027
02:44:48.490 --> 02:44:51.350
I'm personally happy getting on a boat.

4028
02:44:51.350 --> 02:44:53.200
I think that sounds like a lot of fun.

4029
02:44:54.700 --> 02:44:58.560
LAURA: Either way, Orly's going to have to meet us.

4030
02:44:58.560 --> 02:45:01.010
That boat is going to take three weeks.

4031
02:45:01.010 --> 02:45:01.843
TRAVIS: Yeah, the boat's pretty slow.

4032
02:45:01.843 --> 02:45:03.290
LAURA: To get to the other place.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4033
02:45:03.290 --> 02:45:06.690
MARISHA: Okay, why don't we ask Essek first?

4034
02:45:06.690 --> 02:45:09.010
That's always the first step, right, asking?

4035
02:45:09.010 --> 02:45:10.293
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah? All right.

4036
02:45:10.293 --> 02:45:11.550
TRAVIS: (laughs) Something to put

4037
02:45:11.550 --> 02:45:12.540
into practice every time.
LAURA: I'm going to

4038
02:45:12.540 --> 02:45:13.740
send a message to Essek.

4039
02:45:18.950 --> 02:45:23.340
Question: if we needed to teleport somewhere,

4040
02:45:24.600 --> 02:45:27.260
would you be able to do it because you love us now?

4041
02:45:30.030 --> 02:45:32.630
Or is still, like,

4042
02:45:34.180 --> 02:45:35.013
not cool?

4043
02:45:37.073 --> 02:45:38.039
Ish.
TRAVIS: It's hard to count words.

4044
02:45:38.039 --> 02:45:39.690
My ADD goes crazy.

4045
02:45:39.690 --> 02:45:43.668
MATT: "Well, that depends on where are you going."

4046
02:45:43.668 --> 02:45:44.709
LAURA: Fuck.

4047
02:45:45.767 --> 02:45:48.591
MATT: "If it is a place I don't know,

4048
02:45:48.591 --> 02:45:50.360
"there is significant risk.

4049
02:45:50.360 --> 02:45:52.022
"But possible."

4050
02:45:54.830 --> 02:45:56.520
TRAVIS: We did this before, when we were chasing Obann.

4051
02:45:56.520 --> 02:45:57.353
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4052
02:45:57.353 --> 02:45:59.730
TRAVIS: We just fell through a bunch of fucking trees.

4053
02:45:59.730 --> 02:46:01.038
LAURA: That's risky.

4054
02:46:01.038 --> 02:46:02.988
MARISHA: But I'm into it.

4055
02:46:02.988 --> 02:46:03.829
Right?

4056
02:46:03.829 --> 02:46:04.879
We're into it?

4057
02:46:04.879 --> 02:46:06.254
TALIESIN: I mean--
MARISHA: What do we want to do?

4058
02:46:06.254 --> 02:46:07.320
TRAVIS: It's a great idea.

4059
02:46:07.320 --> 02:46:09.590
I think it's actually the fastest way to do it.

4060
02:46:09.590 --> 02:46:13.550
LAURA: And then we do the stuff for Caduceus.

4061
02:46:13.550 --> 02:46:15.270
TALIESIN: And then--
LAURA: We can teleport to

4062
02:46:15.270 --> 02:46:16.960
Nicodranas.
TALIESIN: And then we take a boat ride

4063
02:46:16.960 --> 02:46:18.210
for three weeks.
LAURA: And then we take a boat.

4064
02:46:18.210 --> 02:46:19.426
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4065
02:46:19.426 --> 02:46:22.320
LAURA: Well, not for three weeks, just for a couple weeks.

4066
02:46:22.320 --> 02:46:24.150
We go deal with the negotiation

4067
02:46:24.150 --> 02:46:25.700
and then we go to Traveler Con.

4068
02:46:27.180 --> 02:46:28.851
MARISHA: Are you wanting to take a boat because--

4069
02:46:28.851 --> 02:46:30.293
TALIESIN: I was excited on a boat.

4070
02:46:30.293 --> 02:46:31.860
MARISHA: Are you excited about the boat because

4071
02:46:31.860 --> 02:46:33.920
it was going to stall for another three weeks?

4072
02:46:33.920 --> 02:46:35.095
TALIESIN: I don't know.

4073
02:46:35.095 --> 02:46:36.278
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

4074
02:46:37.890 --> 02:46:40.704
TRAVIS: Caduceus, you're very honest, normally.

4075
02:46:40.704 --> 02:46:42.740
MARISHA: I think he honestly doesn't know.

4076
02:46:42.740 --> 02:46:44.556
TALIESIN: I don't know.

4077
02:46:44.556 --> 02:46:46.540
LAURA: We could go to Nicodranas,

4078
02:46:46.540 --> 02:46:49.420
get on the boat, go do the negotiation,

4079
02:46:49.420 --> 02:46:53.180
go to Traveler Con, and then go do the stuff for your family

4080
02:46:53.180 --> 02:46:56.140
if you want to delay.
TALIESIN: There is the negotiation.

4081
02:46:57.760 --> 02:46:59.450
No.
LAURA: We have to be on the boat.

4082
02:46:59.450 --> 02:47:02.450
TALIESIN: No, let's do this, all right.

4083
02:47:02.450 --> 02:47:03.733
TRAVIS: Fuck yes, let's do this.

4084
02:47:03.733 --> 02:47:04.566
LAURA: Really?

4085
02:47:06.560 --> 02:47:07.901
TALIESIN: Sure.

4086
02:47:07.901 --> 02:47:08.920
LAURA: Okay.

4087
02:47:08.920 --> 02:47:11.300
How much time until Traveler Con?

4088
02:47:11.300 --> 02:47:16.300
MATT: It's about, I think, four weeks, four to five weeks

4089
02:47:16.320 --> 02:47:18.770
at this point, somewhere in that neighborhood.

4090
02:47:18.770 --> 02:47:21.920
The negotiation--
MARISHA: It hasn't changed or it's--

4091
02:47:21.920 --> 02:47:23.240
LAURA: I mean, it's only been a couple days.

4092
02:47:23.240 --> 02:47:24.710
Every time I ask, it's like a day.

4093
02:47:24.710 --> 02:47:25.754
MATT: Yeah.
MARISHA: It's always a day.

4094
02:47:25.754 --> 02:47:27.153
MATT: Yeah, it's between four and five weeks, I think.

4095
02:47:27.153 --> 02:47:28.677
TRAVIS: People come and go so quickly.

4096
02:47:28.677 --> 02:47:30.940
TALIESIN: I have everything I need for--

4097
02:47:30.940 --> 02:47:32.480
I don't necessarily know what I need to do,

4098
02:47:32.480 --> 02:47:35.160
but I've got everything I need for--

4099
02:47:35.160 --> 02:47:37.080
MATT: You have completed the visions

4100
02:47:37.080 --> 02:47:40.160
that brought you to Kravaraad

4101
02:47:41.100 --> 02:47:44.640
and you have the materials that you recall in the visions

4102
02:47:44.640 --> 02:47:46.080
that you required for the next stage,

4103
02:47:46.080 --> 02:47:47.763
but that's all you know.

4104
02:47:49.080 --> 02:47:50.596
TALIESIN: Okay, yeah.

4105
02:47:52.080 --> 02:47:53.480
LAURA: You want to try it?
TALIESIN: Sure.

4106
02:47:56.378 --> 02:47:59.024
LAURA: All right, let's go to Xhorhas.

4107
02:47:59.024 --> 02:48:01.100
LIAM: (chalk scratching)

4108
02:48:01.100 --> 02:48:02.680
Ready?
LAURA: Yeah.

4109
02:48:02.680 --> 02:48:06.958
LIAM: (whooshing)

4110
02:48:06.958 --> 02:48:09.212
LAURA: Oh, we didn't tell them.

4111
02:48:09.212 --> 02:48:10.604
SAM: Ah, shit.

4112
02:48:10.604 --> 02:48:12.590
(laughter)

4113
02:48:12.590 --> 02:48:14.856
MARISHA: We told the one person without the other.

4114
02:48:14.856 --> 02:48:16.082
TALIESIN: We talked about it.

4115
02:48:16.082 --> 02:48:18.058
LAURA: We talked about it.
LIAM: That's a step in the right direction.

4116
02:48:18.058 --> 02:48:19.015
TALIESIN: Ugh.

4117
02:48:19.015 --> 02:48:22.216
MATT: Baby steps, guys, baby steps.

4118
02:48:22.216 --> 02:48:23.524
TALIESIN: We're the worst.

4119
02:48:23.524 --> 02:48:25.407
MARISHA: We're incapable of changing our actions.

4120
02:48:25.407 --> 02:48:27.224
LIAM: We wanted to care.

4121
02:48:27.224 --> 02:48:28.489
MATT: Eh, really?

4122
02:48:28.489 --> 02:48:29.680
LAURA: (laughs)

4123
02:48:29.680 --> 02:48:31.540
TALIESIN: We are the worst house guests.

4124
02:48:32.470 --> 02:48:33.303
MATT: All right.

4125
02:48:34.980 --> 02:48:37.000
You all immediately return,

4126
02:48:39.310 --> 02:48:42.495
there we go, to the Lucid Bastion basement.

4127
02:48:42.495 --> 02:48:43.578
(rapid whooshing)

4128
02:48:43.578 --> 02:48:45.760
All arriving in the familiar basement,

4129
02:48:45.760 --> 02:48:50.760
the posted Aurora Watch spin around just to check,

4130
02:48:51.130 --> 02:48:53.777
that brief moment of (grunts)

4131
02:48:53.777 --> 02:48:55.415
(sighing)

4132
02:48:55.415 --> 02:48:57.090
and they go back to their post.

4133
02:48:57.090 --> 02:48:59.790
You walk the familiar crystal-walled halls,

4134
02:49:01.300 --> 02:49:03.380
head nods of recognition, though it is bustling,

4135
02:49:03.380 --> 02:49:05.970
you can tell that there is an energy here,

4136
02:49:05.970 --> 02:49:09.560
probably due to the current

4137
02:49:09.560 --> 02:49:10.940
holding of any sort of conflict.

4138
02:49:10.940 --> 02:49:12.780
A lot of people are figuring out what to do,

4139
02:49:12.780 --> 02:49:14.270
what to watch for, and what to be careful of

4140
02:49:14.270 --> 02:49:16.120
in that time period as well as preparations for

4141
02:49:16.120 --> 02:49:19.030
this seafront negotiation of which,

4142
02:49:19.030 --> 02:49:21.690
while the leaders will not be physically present,

4143
02:49:21.690 --> 02:49:22.940
there will be a lot at stake

4144
02:49:22.940 --> 02:49:24.790
and on the table for this discussion.

4145
02:49:26.100 --> 02:49:29.280
You make your way into the open Gallimaufry,

4146
02:49:29.280 --> 02:49:32.010
heading your way towards the neighborhood

4147
02:49:32.010 --> 02:49:37.010
where the Xhorhaus resides. The tree greets you,

4148
02:49:37.370 --> 02:49:40.090
still glowing in the eternal night that is the city.

4149
02:49:41.860 --> 02:49:45.750
You approach the door, (bell ringing),

4150
02:49:45.750 --> 02:49:49.600
it opens, and your home is as you left it.

4151
02:49:49.600 --> 02:49:51.350
LAURA: I'm going to go wash all this poison-y

4152
02:49:51.350 --> 02:49:53.650
swamp nastiness off of me.

4153
02:49:53.650 --> 02:49:56.350
SAM: It just occurred to me, we have a lot of money.

4154
02:49:57.390 --> 02:49:59.300
Should we hire someone to take care of

4155
02:49:59.300 --> 02:50:00.880
the house while we're not here?

4156
02:50:00.880 --> 02:50:02.610
LAURA: Well we did, but they up and left.

4157
02:50:02.610 --> 02:50:04.640
I don't even know where she went.

4158
02:50:04.640 --> 02:50:06.073
SAM: She wasn't really hired.

4159
02:50:06.073 --> 02:50:08.110
MARISHA: Dairon? She's an Expositor

4160
02:50:08.110 --> 02:50:09.915
of the Cobalt Reserve.
LAURA: I don't know

4161
02:50:09.915 --> 02:50:11.850
what you're talking about, I'm going to go take a bath.

4162
02:50:14.350 --> 02:50:16.548
SAM: Should we hire--
TRAVIS: No, I don't really care.

4163
02:50:16.548 --> 02:50:17.530
I think it's quite nice now.

4164
02:50:17.530 --> 02:50:19.870
SAM: But there's never any food here when we get back,

4165
02:50:19.870 --> 02:50:21.003
we have to go shopping.

4166
02:50:21.003 --> 02:50:22.103
TRAVIS: That's what Caduceus is for.

4167
02:50:22.103 --> 02:50:23.455
SAM: I guess so, but--

4168
02:50:23.455 --> 02:50:25.013
MARISHA: Caduceus, can we heat up the hot tub?

4169
02:50:26.155 --> 02:50:27.676
TALIESIN: Yeah, oh, I can--
LAURA: We emptied the hot tub.

4170
02:50:27.676 --> 02:50:29.100
We have to fill up the hot tub.

4171
02:50:29.100 --> 02:50:31.990
SAM: Our servant could do that for us.

4172
02:50:31.990 --> 02:50:32.823
TRAVIS: Caduceus, could I have a

4173
02:50:32.823 --> 02:50:34.664
mushroom and moss sandwich, please?

4174
02:50:34.664 --> 02:50:35.497
SAM: (laughs)

4175
02:50:35.497 --> 02:50:37.367
TALIESIN: I can do all of these things.

4176
02:50:37.367 --> 02:50:38.271
MATT: (chuckles)

4177
02:50:38.271 --> 02:50:39.910
LIAM: It's still relatively early in the day, right?

4178
02:50:39.910 --> 02:50:40.910
We woke up--

4179
02:50:40.910 --> 02:50:42.220
SAM: 7 a.m.

4180
02:50:42.220 --> 02:50:43.120
LIAM: Put some stone on the ground--

4181
02:50:43.120 --> 02:50:45.010
MATT: You did, but you traveled a
bit, so you lost a bit of time.

4182
02:50:45.010 --> 02:50:47.852
LIAM: Okay.
MATT: By the time you guys had

4183
02:50:47.852 --> 02:50:49.584
come to and set yourself up

4184
02:50:49.584 --> 02:50:52.810
and so, I'd say you would have left around probably nine.

4185
02:50:52.810 --> 02:50:54.733
LIAM: Okay.
MATT: To have gotten your full rest

4186
02:50:54.733 --> 02:50:57.200
from the time you did actually sleep.

4187
02:50:57.200 --> 02:50:59.230
Getting here, I'd say it's close to midday.

4188
02:50:59.230 --> 02:51:01.110
Though, once again, middle of the night.

4189
02:51:01.110 --> 02:51:04.120
LIAM: Right.
MATT: Here in Rosohna most of the time.

4190
02:51:04.120 --> 02:51:05.650
You're looking around noon.

4191
02:51:05.650 --> 02:51:06.483
LIAM: Okay.

4192
02:51:08.870 --> 02:51:11.560
MATT: You begin to prepare--
TALIESIN: Go prepare the hot tub

4193
02:51:11.560 --> 02:51:12.690
and I'm going to make some sandwiches

4194
02:51:12.690 --> 02:51:14.136
for everybody.
MATT: Okay, there you go.

4195
02:51:14.136 --> 02:51:16.830
A proper moment of downtime. (laughs)

4196
02:51:16.830 --> 02:51:18.180
TALIESIN: Crusts cut off, I assume.

4197
02:51:20.100 --> 02:51:21.470
TRAVIS: What?
SAM: Crust cut off?

4198
02:51:21.470 --> 02:51:22.990
TRAVIS: No, that's where all the nutrients are, right?

4199
02:51:22.990 --> 02:51:25.300
You said it's all in the crust.

4200
02:51:25.300 --> 02:51:28.000
TALIESIN: I was just assuming you were going to be picky.

4201
02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:29.270
TRAVIS: No!
TALIESIN: Oh, all right.

4202
02:51:29.270 --> 02:51:30.990
ASHLEY: Wait, what kind of sandwich is this?

4203
02:51:30.990 --> 02:51:32.423
TRAVIS: Mushroom and moss.

4204
02:51:32.423 --> 02:51:33.664
ASHLEY: Mushroom and moss?
TALIESIN: It's an M&amp;M.

4205
02:51:33.664 --> 02:51:34.497
TRAVIS: Caduceus special.

4206
02:51:34.497 --> 02:51:37.140
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm working on it.

4207
02:51:37.140 --> 02:51:38.690
Tiny triangles, tiny triangles.

4208
02:51:39.552 --> 02:51:40.785
TRAVIS: That's very sweet.

4209
02:51:40.785 --> 02:51:42.450
TALIESIN: Like tea sandwiches.

4210
02:51:42.450 --> 02:51:43.630
TRAVIS: Oh, (laughs) yeah.

4211
02:51:44.710 --> 02:51:46.268
(laughter)

4212
02:51:46.268 --> 02:51:47.464
TRAVIS: I thought it was multi-tiered.

4213
02:51:47.464 --> 02:51:48.761
MARISHA: So cute.

4214
02:51:48.761 --> 02:51:50.080
(laughter)

4215
02:51:50.080 --> 02:51:51.520
TRAVIS: More cucumber!

4216
02:51:51.520 --> 02:51:52.490
MATT: While you're making sandwiches,

4217
02:51:52.490 --> 02:51:54.630
you guys have the afternoon here in Rosohna.

4218
02:51:54.630 --> 02:51:56.360
Is there anything you want to accomplish while you're

4219
02:51:56.360 --> 02:51:58.560
in the city, anything you're looking for, or--?

4220
02:52:00.250 --> 02:52:02.751
LIAM: Yeah, I want to go shopping.

4221
02:52:02.751 --> 02:52:03.762
LAURA: (laughs)

4222
02:52:03.762 --> 02:52:05.400
LIAM: I have an errand to run.
MATT: Okay.

4223
02:52:05.400 --> 02:52:07.580
LIAM: That is, I want to ask around town

4224
02:52:08.700 --> 02:52:10.950
and find a magical shop.

4225
02:52:12.430 --> 02:52:13.655
Scrolls.

4226
02:52:13.655 --> 02:52:15.000
MATT: Oh, scrolls in particular.

4227
02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:16.383
LIAM: Yes.

4228
02:52:16.383 --> 02:52:17.732
MATT: You do know,

4229
02:52:17.732 --> 02:52:19.510
there are a couple of small magical shops,

4230
02:52:19.510 --> 02:52:22.190
if there is a place to go to get that sort of knowledge.

4231
02:52:23.680 --> 02:52:25.670
You can try, first, the Marble Tomes Conservatory

4232
02:52:25.670 --> 02:52:26.840
or you can try and look for a place

4233
02:52:26.840 --> 02:52:29.957
that's more off the beaten path.

4234
02:52:29.957 --> 02:52:30.790
Your call.

4235
02:52:30.790 --> 02:52:33.180
LIAM: I will go to the Marble Tome Conservatory.

4236
02:52:33.180 --> 02:52:34.730
MATT: Okay, you do know that place.

4237
02:52:36.365 --> 02:52:37.700
It is a little more controlled, you know,

4238
02:52:37.700 --> 02:52:40.100
it's definitely more of an established location.

4239
02:52:41.310 --> 02:52:43.620
So who knows?
LIAM: I can't remember,

4240
02:52:43.620 --> 02:52:45.786
Caleb does but I can't,

4241
02:52:45.786 --> 02:52:50.340
is that a shop or more of a library?

4242
02:52:50.340 --> 02:52:52.940
MATT: It is a library in a place of learning,

4243
02:52:53.910 --> 02:52:55.630
that is where Professor Waccoh is,

4244
02:52:55.630 --> 02:52:57.100
but it's also where you have the Enchanter Yun

4245
02:52:57.100 --> 02:52:59.087
that made her bracers was.
LIAM: Okay.

4246
02:52:59.087 --> 02:53:00.590
MATT: You have a rapport there.

4247
02:53:00.590 --> 02:53:04.430
LIAM: Okay.
MATT: But it is more of a place of learning.

4248
02:53:04.430 --> 02:53:05.910
It's up to you, if you think the rapport that you have--

4249
02:53:05.910 --> 02:53:07.403
LIAM: I'll look for the shop, I'll look for the shop.

4250
02:53:07.403 --> 02:53:09.169
I'm going to go bargain--
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4251
02:53:09.169 --> 02:53:10.500
LIAM: Bargain bin.
TRAVIS: Yeah!

4252
02:53:10.500 --> 02:53:11.952
LIAM: Diving.
MATT: Make an investigation check

4253
02:53:11.952 --> 02:53:14.287
with disadvantage.
TRAVIS: Come on baby, let's go.

4254
02:53:14.287 --> 02:53:16.805
MARISHA: $5 DVDs.
TRAVIS: Yep.

4255
02:53:16.805 --> 02:53:19.250
LIAM: I will say that--
MATT: Actually--

4256
02:53:19.250 --> 02:53:21.670
LIAM: I was about to drop a Fortune's Favor on myself before

4257
02:53:21.670 --> 02:53:23.380
heading out the door.
MATT: You can do that.

4258
02:53:23.380 --> 02:53:26.480
We're going to make it, just situationally here--

4259
02:53:28.430 --> 02:53:30.596
TRAVIS: We're property owners.
MATT: Persuasion with disadvantage.

4260
02:53:30.596 --> 02:53:31.620
LIAM: Persuasion with disadvantage.

4261
02:53:31.620 --> 02:53:34.222
MATT: Because it's less about discovering the information.

4262
02:53:34.222 --> 02:53:35.588
The DC's lower.

4263
02:53:37.060 --> 02:53:40.708
But because you are a lone human in the middle of Rosohna,

4264
02:53:41.687 --> 02:53:43.350
it is a little more challenging to get information

4265
02:53:43.350 --> 02:53:44.860
out of people that don't have a rapport with you.

4266
02:53:44.860 --> 02:53:45.835
Go ahead and roll.

4267
02:53:45.835 --> 02:53:46.762
LIAM: I took out my lil

4268
02:53:46.762 --> 02:53:47.948
(package crinkling)

4269
02:53:47.948 --> 02:53:49.510
dingle dangle.
MATT: You do.

4270
02:53:50.380 --> 02:53:52.540
And in some places--
LIAM: So with Fortune's Favor,

4271
02:53:52.540 --> 02:53:54.250
it's a straight roll.
MATT: Correct.

4272
02:53:54.250 --> 02:53:57.272
LIAM: Persuasion, you said?
MATT: Correct.

4273
02:53:57.272 --> 02:53:59.972
MARISHA and LIAM: (laughs)

4274
02:53:59.972 --> 02:54:01.063
I'm sorry.
LIAM: Bink.

4275
02:54:01.063 --> 02:54:02.563
SAM: Aww.

4276
02:54:02.563 --> 02:54:04.900
MATT: You spend the better part of the next two hours

4277
02:54:04.900 --> 02:54:07.310
of people sending you, like, "Oh yeah,

4278
02:54:07.310 --> 02:54:08.960
"go down this road and find this."

4279
02:54:08.960 --> 02:54:09.950
And you get there and there's nothing there

4280
02:54:09.950 --> 02:54:12.050
and this one goes like, "Oh, gave you wrong directions.

4281
02:54:12.050 --> 02:54:14.000
"You want to go down this corner around there."

4282
02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:16.620
And it takes you awhile, in your earnestness,

4283
02:54:16.620 --> 02:54:19.100
to realize you've been fucked with.

4284
02:54:19.100 --> 02:54:20.900
And you've just lost a couple hours

4285
02:54:20.900 --> 02:54:22.930
and you've been even further lost

4286
02:54:22.930 --> 02:54:26.160
and you found spaces you've never been to.

4287
02:54:26.160 --> 02:54:29.100
You do come across a very large

4288
02:54:29.100 --> 02:54:32.320
hedge maze-like garden on the edge of the Gallimaufry,

4289
02:54:32.320 --> 02:54:34.610
it's the only thing of interest you come across,

4290
02:54:34.610 --> 02:54:36.193
but it is beautiful.

4291
02:54:37.820 --> 02:54:40.520
You see an elderly lizardfolk who's out there

4292
02:54:40.520 --> 02:54:42.020
tending to the garden.

4293
02:54:43.110 --> 02:54:45.880
That's it, that's the only thing of interest you run into.

4294
02:54:45.880 --> 02:54:49.470
LIAM: Job well done, Caleb Widogast.

4295
02:54:49.470 --> 02:54:52.500
I Keen Mind follow the trail I took to get to this spot

4296
02:54:52.500 --> 02:54:54.430
back home.
MATT: Okay, you got it.

4297
02:54:54.430 --> 02:54:55.580
LIAM: Good times.

4298
02:54:55.580 --> 02:54:57.188
MATT: Sorry, buddy. (laughs)

4299
02:54:57.188 --> 02:54:59.240
Anybody else, anything you want to

4300
02:54:59.240 --> 02:55:00.380
accomplish while they're in the city?

4301
02:55:00.380 --> 02:55:03.263
TALIESIN: I'm making a really
nice tub. It's going to be--

4302
02:55:03.263 --> 02:55:04.220
MATT: There you go, some herbs--

4303
02:55:04.220 --> 02:55:05.778
ASHLEY: Flowers in it.
MATT: Get in a good soak. There you go.

4304
02:55:05.778 --> 02:55:07.502
TALIESIN: Candles, the whole deal.

4305
02:55:07.502 --> 02:55:09.830
SAM: I'm going to wander to the Corona District.

4306
02:55:09.830 --> 02:55:13.040
MATT: Ah, yes.
SAM: And see if I can find

4307
02:55:13.040 --> 02:55:14.673
a servant for hire.

4308
02:55:15.573 --> 02:55:16.598
MATT: Okay.

4309
02:55:18.457 --> 02:55:21.800
You have a much better time than Caleb did.

4310
02:55:21.800 --> 02:55:22.860
Yeah, there is work to be had.

4311
02:55:22.860 --> 02:55:24.208
You go into there and you can see

4312
02:55:24.208 --> 02:55:26.700
there are a lot of individuals that are

4313
02:55:26.700 --> 02:55:28.550
hanging out in front of taverns.

4314
02:55:28.550 --> 02:55:29.910
Some of them look relaxing
but some of them

4315
02:55:29.910 --> 02:55:32.131
when you get close with that looking eye,

4316
02:55:32.131 --> 02:55:34.472
like, "Hey, you looking to hire?

4317
02:55:34.472 --> 02:55:36.340
"You got any building work,
you building anything?"

4318
02:55:36.340 --> 02:55:37.320
SAM: Maybe.
MATT: "Imagine I can help ya."

4319
02:55:37.320 --> 02:55:39.420
SAM: Maybe, what's your skill set?

4320
02:55:39.420 --> 02:55:42.273
MATT: Somebody else is like, "Ah, don't
listen to him, he's full of shit.

4321
02:55:42.273 --> 02:55:44.623
"Me and Joey over here, we can
totally get you covered, don't worry."

4322
02:55:44.623 --> 02:55:46.739
SAM: You and Joey, eh?
MATT: "Yeah."

4323
02:55:46.739 --> 02:55:48.497
SAM: What's your skillset?
I'm looking for--

4324
02:55:48.497 --> 02:55:49.960
MATT: "Joedek, but we call him Joey."

4325
02:55:49.960 --> 02:55:52.685
SAM: In home care, home care.

4326
02:55:52.685 --> 02:55:56.668
MATT: "Yeah, no. We care about many
homes, they're great, is that right?

4327
02:55:56.668 --> 02:55:59.340
And he's like, "Yep."
SAM: Oh boy.

4328
02:55:59.340 --> 02:56:00.265
TRAVIS: Yep.

4329
02:56:00.265 --> 02:56:02.830
SAM: More of like a butler sort
of a thing, I think not.

4330
02:56:02.830 --> 02:56:04.130
MATT: He changes his posture.

4331
02:56:04.130 --> 02:56:05.360
"Of course, we can help you in

4332
02:56:05.360 --> 02:56:06.930
"whatever you require,
isn't that right?"

4333
02:56:06.930 --> 02:56:08.305
The guy's, "Yep."

4334
02:56:09.413 --> 02:56:10.504
SAM: Hm.

4335
02:56:10.504 --> 02:56:13.070
TRAVIS: Perfect.
SAM: Ah, no thank you.

4336
02:56:13.070 --> 02:56:14.711
I'll just keep perusing.

4337
02:56:14.711 --> 02:56:16.194
MATT: "Ah, you son of a bitch!"

4338
02:56:16.194 --> 02:56:19.127
And he's just screaming at you from behind. (laughs)

4339
02:56:21.060 --> 02:56:24.790
There isn't a housekeeping service necessarily,

4340
02:56:26.170 --> 02:56:30.270
but I'll say, in asking around, you do come across

4341
02:56:32.670 --> 02:56:37.540
this really, really sweet, young, bright-eyed

4342
02:56:37.540 --> 02:56:41.370
drow girl who has her...

4343
02:56:42.320 --> 02:56:46.160
her platinum-white hair goes to a purple tint

4344
02:56:46.160 --> 02:56:50.370
at the tips and she keeps
it very well kept in the back

4345
02:56:50.370 --> 02:56:53.620
and tied in two places, she's dressed in

4346
02:56:53.620 --> 02:56:56.930
nice, standard clothing
and you catch her brooming

4347
02:56:56.930 --> 02:57:00.540
on the exterior of a small livery.

4348
02:57:02.170 --> 02:57:04.180
And immediately you catch the attention

4349
02:57:04.180 --> 02:57:06.940
of somebody that looks,
you know, non-threatening,

4350
02:57:06.940 --> 02:57:09.040
non-aggressive, and, apparently, is clean.

4351
02:57:10.650 --> 02:57:12.670
SAM: Hello there, young miss.

4352
02:57:13.540 --> 02:57:16.280
Do you work here?
MATT: "I do."

4353
02:57:16.280 --> 02:57:21.180
SAM: Oh, and your job is to
keep things clean and orderly?

4354
02:57:21.180 --> 02:57:23.670
MATT: "That is one of my jobs, yes."

4355
02:57:23.670 --> 02:57:27.130
SAM: Oh, I'm looking for me--
for my friends and I are

4356
02:57:27.130 --> 02:57:32.130
looking for someone to help us
with our home when we travel.

4357
02:57:32.200 --> 02:57:35.920
Would you be available to
moonlight in that sort of a job

4358
02:57:35.920 --> 02:57:39.770
or are you, you know, on
salary here or something?

4359
02:57:39.770 --> 02:57:44.310
MATT: "No, I am-- well now, what
are you paying, perhaps?"

4360
02:57:45.860 --> 02:57:47.137
SAM: Oh boy.

4361
02:57:48.770 --> 02:57:50.780
What do you make here per day?

4362
02:57:52.540 --> 02:57:55.623
MATT: "Well, my standard rate comes to about...

4363
02:57:57.148 --> 02:58:00.006
"one gold five silver."

4364
02:58:00.006 --> 02:58:01.610
SAM: That sounds fine to me.

4365
02:58:01.610 --> 02:58:03.701
MATT: "Per day?"
SAM: Sure.

4366
02:58:03.701 --> 02:58:06.085
LAURA: (laughs)

4367
02:58:06.085 --> 02:58:07.473
SAM: Sure.

4368
02:58:07.473 --> 02:58:08.464
LIAM: (coughing)

4369
02:58:08.464 --> 02:58:09.920
SAM: Sounds good to me.

4370
02:58:09.920 --> 02:58:11.745
TRAVIS: Should be better being
that close to Laura.

4371
02:58:11.745 --> 02:58:15.145
SAM: Is there a monthly rate
or is just every day--

4372
02:58:15.145 --> 02:58:19.143
MATT: "This is for an extended engagement--?"

4373
02:58:19.143 --> 02:58:22.430
SAM: Yes, we sometimes travel
for long periods of time.

4374
02:58:22.430 --> 02:58:25.530
And we need to be able to
trust you, can we trust you?

4375
02:58:25.530 --> 02:58:27.820
MATT: "Can you trust me?"
SAM: Insight check.

4376
02:58:27.820 --> 02:58:29.460
MATT: Go for it.

4377
02:58:29.460 --> 02:58:31.540
She gives you these very waifish

4378
02:58:31.540 --> 02:58:33.870
doe-like eyes and this soft smile.

4379
02:58:33.870 --> 02:58:36.657
SAM: 21.
MATT: 21.

4380
02:58:36.657 --> 02:58:37.990
SAM: I get a whisper?
TALIESIN: That's right, get up.

4381
02:58:37.990 --> 02:58:39.030
SAM: I get a whisper out of this.

4382
02:58:39.030 --> 02:58:40.771
TRAVIS: You notice the hilts of
two daggers poking out of her--

4383
02:58:40.771 --> 02:58:42.812
MARISHA: Yeah, no shit.
(laughter)

4384
02:58:42.812 --> 02:58:44.945
LIAM: It's the Inevitable End.

4385
02:58:44.945 --> 02:58:46.203
TALIESIN: Braces, bracers?

4386
02:58:46.203 --> 02:58:48.561
TRAVIS: This whisper is
brought to you by Skillshare.

4387
02:58:49.811 --> 02:58:51.210
ASHLEY: Or did I get those?
MARISHA: I've got those bracers.

4388
02:58:51.210 --> 02:58:52.960
TRAVIS: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Wait, you have them?

4389
02:58:52.960 --> 02:58:54.501
ASHLEY: Do you use them?

4390
02:58:54.501 --> 02:58:56.877
LIAM: Nope, because you
have to have no armor on.

4391
02:58:56.877 --> 02:58:58.130
ASHLEY: Oh, right.
TALIESIN: And you're wearing?

4392
02:58:58.130 --> 02:58:59.822
LIAM: My Frodo armor.

4393
02:58:59.822 --> 02:59:03.214
SAM: I like you, I like
the cut of your jib.

4394
02:59:03.214 --> 02:59:06.190
What's your name, child?
MATT: "Vidalla."

4395
02:59:06.190 --> 02:59:08.440
SAM: Vidalla is beautiful.
LAURA: I don't trust her at all.

4396
02:59:08.440 --> 02:59:09.973
SAM: Unquestionably beautiful.

4397
02:59:09.973 --> 02:59:12.006
MARISHA: She's going to
fucking rob us blind.

4398
02:59:12.006 --> 02:59:13.847
TRAVIS: What do we have in there?
ASHLEY: As soon as we leave.

4399
02:59:13.847 --> 02:59:14.680
TRAVIS: A hot tub and a tree.

4400
02:59:14.680 --> 02:59:16.240
SAM: How about this, because I know that

4401
02:59:16.240 --> 02:59:19.110
my friends would not appreciate me

4402
02:59:19.110 --> 02:59:23.110
hiring someone without
at least a negotiation.

4403
02:59:23.977 --> 02:59:27.582
Would you do it for one gold,
four silver per day?

4404
02:59:28.850 --> 02:59:31.540
MATT: "If that's what would
you prefer, of course.

4405
02:59:31.540 --> 02:59:33.323
"You were talking about
a monthly rate, right?"

4406
02:59:33.323 --> 02:59:34.289
SAM: Yes.

4407
02:59:36.340 --> 02:59:37.580
MATT: "We could go for the daily rate,

4408
02:59:37.580 --> 02:59:39.760
"if it is something you're more preferring.

4409
02:59:39.760 --> 02:59:42.430
"For a monthly rate, we
could do it for, let's say

4410
02:59:43.930 --> 02:59:45.618
"40 gold for the month?"

4411
02:59:45.618 --> 02:59:46.451
LAURA: Oh--

4412
02:59:47.996 --> 02:59:49.530
SAM: I think that works.

4413
02:59:49.530 --> 02:59:52.720
Sure, yeah, that sounds
great, let's do it.

4414
02:59:52.720 --> 02:59:53.553
But you know what?

4415
02:59:53.553 --> 02:59:56.490
I can't hire you without
introducing you to my friends,

4416
02:59:56.490 --> 02:59:58.440
so could you walk across town with me?

4417
02:59:58.440 --> 03:00:01.170
I'm a stranger and I'm a goblin.

4418
03:00:01.170 --> 03:00:02.003
(laughter)

4419
03:00:02.003 --> 03:00:03.470
MATT: "Certainly."

4420
03:00:03.470 --> 03:00:06.160
Goes out and sets the
broom back inside and goes,

4421
03:00:06.160 --> 03:00:07.660
"Detta!

4422
03:00:07.660 --> 03:00:09.410
"I'm taking my lunch!"

4423
03:00:10.300 --> 03:00:11.838
TRAVIS: Totally different.
MATT: "Whenever."

4424
03:00:11.838 --> 03:00:13.349
TRAVIS: (laughing)

4425
03:00:13.349 --> 03:00:15.016
SAM: What was that? Okay.

4426
03:00:16.630 --> 03:00:18.640
Follow me.
MATT: "Of course."

4427
03:00:18.640 --> 03:00:20.768
SAM: All right, I'll walk her back to our place.

4428
03:00:20.768 --> 03:00:22.485
TRAVIS: Promotion!
LAURA: I'm going to go--

4429
03:00:22.485 --> 03:00:24.243
LIAM: This is the beginning
of the movie Parasite.

4430
03:00:24.243 --> 03:00:25.204
(laughter)

4431
03:00:25.204 --> 03:00:27.260
LAURA: Oh my god.
MARISHA: Did you watch it?

4432
03:00:27.260 --> 03:00:30.190
TRAVIS: Oh yes--
MARISHA: It's so good.

4433
03:00:30.190 --> 03:00:31.950
MATT: Best movie of last year.
ASHLEY: It's so good.

4434
03:00:31.950 --> 03:00:35.050
MATT: Anyway, continue.
LAURA: I'm going to go upstairs

4435
03:00:35.050 --> 03:00:36.583
to the tree.
MATT: Okay.

4436
03:00:36.583 --> 03:00:38.540
LAURA: To where we have all of our--

4437
03:00:39.730 --> 03:00:43.040
TALIESIN: Shrines.
LAURA: Shrines, yes, thank you.

4438
03:00:44.531 --> 03:00:47.047
And I'm going to cast

4439
03:00:47.047 --> 03:00:48.722
Word of Recall.

4440
03:00:50.060 --> 03:00:52.037
TRAVIS: Where are all these
fucking spells coming from?

4441
03:00:52.037 --> 03:00:53.730
TALIESIN: Oh.
LIAM: The massive Cleric list.

4442
03:00:53.730 --> 03:00:55.047
TRAVIS: Shit.

4443
03:00:55.047 --> 03:00:59.690
LAURA: I'm going to cast Word
of Recall on the little shrine

4444
03:00:59.690 --> 03:01:01.531
I've made to the Traveler.

4445
03:01:01.531 --> 03:01:02.547
MATT: Okay.

4446
03:01:06.320 --> 03:01:07.978
MATT: Hold on, I'm pulling it up.

4447
03:01:09.323 --> 03:01:10.748
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, well I have--

4448
03:01:13.700 --> 03:01:15.070
MATT: Ah, you designate the sanctuary.

4449
03:01:15.070 --> 03:01:16.730
LAURA: Yes.
MATT: Gotcha, okay.

4450
03:01:18.300 --> 03:01:19.775
You have now--

4451
03:01:20.775 --> 03:01:23.125
as you complete the spell,

4452
03:01:23.125 --> 03:01:25.260
you can see the tree itself suddenly

4453
03:01:25.260 --> 03:01:27.740
begins to drop some of its leaves.

4454
03:01:28.610 --> 03:01:31.950
These green leaves slowly drift down

4455
03:01:31.950 --> 03:01:35.541
and as they hit the ground,
a green little light

4456
03:01:35.541 --> 03:01:38.070
(poofing) under each one.

4457
03:01:38.960 --> 03:01:41.027
Eventually they all scatter (whoosh)

4458
03:01:41.027 --> 03:01:43.660
from a breeze that seems
to come from nowhere

4459
03:01:43.660 --> 03:01:46.694
and you sense the familiar
presence of the Traveler

4460
03:01:46.694 --> 03:01:50.732
smiling upon this particular land.

4461
03:01:50.732 --> 03:01:52.332
LAURA: Awesome.
TRAVIS: Shit.

4462
03:01:53.800 --> 03:01:55.480
MATT: Awesome.

4463
03:01:55.480 --> 03:01:57.910
Anybody else doing anything?

4464
03:01:57.910 --> 03:01:59.990
You don't have to, you can just wait

4465
03:01:59.990 --> 03:02:02.020
if you're not particularly
going to do something.

4466
03:02:02.020 --> 03:02:06.940
TALIESIN: Oh, you have the +2 Bracers
of Defense, you took them?

4467
03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:11.243
MARISHA: Those were +2?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4468
03:02:12.316 --> 03:02:14.970
MATT: The ones you have are +2 already.
MARISHA: Oh yeah, mine are the exact same.

4469
03:02:14.970 --> 03:02:16.240
TALIESIN: Okay.

4470
03:02:16.240 --> 03:02:19.257
ASHLEY: Yeah, maybe I can sell these or something.

4471
03:02:20.450 --> 03:02:22.658
I'll figure it out.

4472
03:02:22.658 --> 03:02:24.333
TALIESIN: That thing where you order something online

4473
03:02:24.333 --> 03:02:27.647
and immediately see something
just slightly better after that.

4474
03:02:27.647 --> 03:02:29.587
ASHLEY: Like at a better price.
LAURA and TALIESIN: Yeah.

4475
03:02:29.587 --> 03:02:32.570
TALIESIN: It's like $8 cheaper
and it comes with another option.

4476
03:02:32.570 --> 03:02:35.080
LAURA: But you can only wear
them if you're not wearing armor.

4477
03:02:35.080 --> 03:02:36.850
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, medium armor.

4478
03:02:36.850 --> 03:02:39.073
MATT: Yeah, you got armor on.

4479
03:02:39.073 --> 03:02:40.308
TALIESIN: Yeah, you can't be wearing armor.

4480
03:02:40.308 --> 03:02:42.930
ASHLEY: Oh yeah, because it ups your armor class.

4481
03:02:42.930 --> 03:02:45.830
TALIESIN: No shield, no armor.
TRAVIS: Got it.

4482
03:02:45.830 --> 03:02:48.020
TALIESIN: Can you, Nott?
MATT: Nott has armor.

4483
03:02:48.020 --> 03:02:49.335
TALIESIN: Nott has armor, nevermind.

4484
03:02:49.335 --> 03:02:51.927
LAURA: Everybody's got armor now.

4485
03:02:51.927 --> 03:02:55.860
ASHLEY: Jester, can I play with Sprinkle for a little bit?

4486
03:02:56.739 --> 03:02:59.680
LAURA: I'm sure Sprinkle would love that!

4487
03:02:59.680 --> 03:03:02.700
Don't bite her, okay?
ASHLEY: Thank you.

4488
03:03:02.700 --> 03:03:03.740
LAURA: He's a little, um,

4489
03:03:06.910 --> 03:03:08.051
skittish.

4490
03:03:08.051 --> 03:03:11.087
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll be very careful.

4491
03:03:11.087 --> 03:03:14.087
MATT: (weasel chittering)

4492
03:03:15.012 --> 03:03:17.200
ASHLEY: I'm going to take him and try to give him

4493
03:03:17.200 --> 03:03:19.828
a little bath and fluff him up in the hot tub.

4494
03:03:19.828 --> 03:03:21.831
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: Oh, he's going to hate it.

4495
03:03:21.831 --> 03:03:26.540
MATT: Now, to be specific here, based on recent adventures

4496
03:03:26.540 --> 03:03:28.820
and the return from where you were,

4497
03:03:28.820 --> 03:03:31.530
it very much looks like one of those viral videos

4498
03:03:31.530 --> 03:03:34.057
when they're cleaning animals after an oil spill.

4499
03:03:34.057 --> 03:03:35.920
(laughter)

4500
03:03:35.920 --> 03:03:39.174
Sprinkle is just like (hacking weasel).

4501
03:03:39.174 --> 03:03:40.532
TRAVIS: The Dawn commercial.

4502
03:03:40.532 --> 03:03:42.040
MARISHA: That's the same thought I had.

4503
03:03:42.040 --> 03:03:44.098
TALIESIN: I'm sitting in the corner of the hot tub

4504
03:03:44.098 --> 03:03:45.489
with my plate of sandwiches, just--

4505
03:03:45.489 --> 03:03:46.973
LAURA: Look, I haven't been giving,

4506
03:03:46.973 --> 03:03:48.632
I didn't give him a bath because he almost drowned

4507
03:03:48.632 --> 03:03:50.496
and he's like Nott and I thought maybe

4508
03:03:50.496 --> 03:03:51.833
he didn't want to be in the water, is all.

4509
03:03:51.833 --> 03:03:54.250
ASHLEY: No no no, we all were so messy and I just,

4510
03:03:54.250 --> 03:03:57.660
I thought he could just, you know, get him all fluffy--

4511
03:03:57.660 --> 03:03:58.870
LAURA: He seems like he likes it, so

4512
03:03:58.870 --> 03:04:00.450
you're doing a good thing.
ASHLEY: Yeah yeah yeah, okay okay.

4513
03:04:00.450 --> 03:04:03.365
SAM: Also, a bunch of zombies exploded acid all over him.

4514
03:04:03.365 --> 03:04:06.250
(laughter)

4515
03:04:06.250 --> 03:04:08.430
LAURA: He was protected, he was in my hood, it's fine.

4516
03:04:08.430 --> 03:04:10.787
LIAM: Bold move bathing a dead animal.

4517
03:04:10.787 --> 03:04:12.386
(laughter)

4518
03:04:12.386 --> 03:04:14.362
MATT: You have to prepare them--
ASHLEY: For five cents a day.

4519
03:04:14.362 --> 03:04:17.254
(laughter)

4520
03:04:17.254 --> 03:04:19.440
MATT: But nevertheless, you do eventually clean Sprinkle off

4521
03:04:19.440 --> 03:04:21.710
and it's a good thing you're a barbarian.

4522
03:04:21.710 --> 03:04:24.477
Your hands are pretty tough

4523
03:04:24.477 --> 03:04:28.530
and the shear amount of bites that would've

4524
03:04:28.530 --> 03:04:33.480
definitely hamburgered someone with a softer grip's hands--

4525
03:04:33.480 --> 03:04:35.210
MARISHA: For the price of a coffee.

4526
03:04:35.210 --> 03:04:38.970
MATT: Your thick skin in your mitts, fairly resistant,

4527
03:04:38.970 --> 03:04:40.630
especially when it starts pissing you off and you start

4528
03:04:40.630 --> 03:04:42.130
rage washing it.
LAURA: Oh!

4529
03:04:42.130 --> 03:04:44.137
MATT: You take half the bite damage from the little--

4530
03:04:44.137 --> 03:04:45.265
(laughter)

4531
03:04:45.265 --> 03:04:47.231
ASHLEY: Oh no.
MATT: The little weasel.

4532
03:04:48.915 --> 03:04:51.320
ASHLEY: I'm going to towel him off and make him all fluffy.

4533
03:04:51.320 --> 03:04:53.735
Make him look all cute.
MATT: (snarling)

4534
03:04:53.735 --> 03:04:54.595
(poofing)

4535
03:04:54.595 --> 03:04:57.183
(laughter)

4536
03:04:57.183 --> 03:05:00.330
LAURA: Whoa, whoa, what weasel smells

4537
03:05:00.330 --> 03:05:02.148
so bad?
ASHLEY: That's stinky.

4538
03:05:02.148 --> 03:05:04.456
(laughter)

4539
03:05:04.456 --> 03:05:07.270
I want to put a little flower on him, see if it stays.

4540
03:05:07.270 --> 03:05:10.810
MATT: Through the process, roll an animal handling for me.

4541
03:05:10.810 --> 03:05:12.090
SAM: Yes.
MATT: I'm curious.

4542
03:05:12.090 --> 03:05:14.430
ASHLEY: Oh boy.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

4543
03:05:14.430 --> 03:05:16.263
TRAVIS: Please be one.

4544
03:05:17.280 --> 03:05:18.113
TALIESIN: Well!

4545
03:05:18.971 --> 03:05:19.968
ASHLEY: Three.

4546
03:05:19.968 --> 03:05:22.135
(laughter)

4547
03:05:22.135 --> 03:05:24.428
LIAM: (breaking) Oh!
MATT: So when--

4548
03:05:24.428 --> 03:05:26.678
(laughter)

4549
03:05:27.552 --> 03:05:30.302
LAURA and ASHLEY: No, no, no.
MATT: No, no.

4550
03:05:30.302 --> 03:05:32.023
No, but--

4551
03:05:32.023 --> 03:05:33.189
TRAVIS: Mending, Mending.

4552
03:05:33.189 --> 03:05:34.872
(laughter)

4553
03:05:34.872 --> 03:05:38.847
MATT: As Yasha brings you back your sweet weasel,

4554
03:05:38.847 --> 03:05:42.113
it's less of a presentation and more of a,

4555
03:05:42.113 --> 03:05:42.946
"Take it from me."

4556
03:05:42.946 --> 03:05:44.449
It's going (angry weasel chittering)

4557
03:05:44.449 --> 03:05:47.141
and it's actually in the process of gnawing--
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

4558
03:05:47.141 --> 03:05:49.257
LAURA: Oh, that was so sweet of you, Yasha.

4559
03:05:49.257 --> 03:05:51.882
ASHLEY: He just, he was a little bit of--
we all were a mess and--

4560
03:05:51.882 --> 03:05:53.415
LAURA: Oh, he looks so cute now.

4561
03:05:53.415 --> 03:05:56.224
ASHLEY: He's going to look so
much better, you know, on your--

4562
03:05:56.224 --> 03:05:58.704
LAURA: He's got a flower on him.

4563
03:05:58.704 --> 03:06:00.320
Here.

4564
03:06:00.320 --> 03:06:01.923
Ah!
ASHLEY: He's--

4565
03:06:01.923 --> 03:06:03.920
(laughter)

4566
03:06:03.920 --> 03:06:07.212
It's weird because he's not very friendly.

4567
03:06:07.212 --> 03:06:11.050
(laughter)

4568
03:06:11.050 --> 03:06:11.884
LIAM: He's really worked up.

4569
03:06:11.884 --> 03:06:13.759
LAURA: Caduceus?
TALIESIN: Yeah?

4570
03:06:13.759 --> 03:06:17.219
LAURA: Do you have any, like, little bugs or pieces of meat

4571
03:06:17.219 --> 03:06:19.360
or anything you can give him?
ASHLEY: He might be hungry.

4572
03:06:19.360 --> 03:06:23.790
TALIESIN: I'm going to: Would you like a sandwich?

4573
03:06:23.790 --> 03:06:26.240
LAURA: Would you like a sandwich?
MATT: He calms a bit.

4574
03:06:26.240 --> 03:06:28.002
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, he wants a sandwich.

4575
03:06:28.002 --> 03:06:30.341
TALIESIN: Ah, come here.

4576
03:06:30.341 --> 03:06:33.200
MATT: (curious weasel chittering)

4577
03:06:33.200 --> 03:06:35.960
(nibbling)
TALIESIN: There you go.

4578
03:06:35.960 --> 03:06:38.097
You want another sandwich?

4579
03:06:38.097 --> 03:06:39.118
MATT: (weasel chitter)

4580
03:06:39.118 --> 03:06:42.292
LAURA: Yes and also, also for me, thank you.

4581
03:06:42.292 --> 03:06:44.570
(chuckling)

4582
03:06:44.570 --> 03:06:48.797
MATT: Eventually, you calm Sprinkle.

4583
03:06:48.797 --> 03:06:52.997
Sprinkle is definitely already reticent

4584
03:06:52.997 --> 03:06:55.720
around Yasha.
LAURA: Aw!

4585
03:06:55.720 --> 03:06:57.560
MATT: You could work towards it, but it's

4586
03:06:57.560 --> 03:06:58.960
a step back in that relationship.

4587
03:06:58.960 --> 03:07:02.020
ASHLEY: I don't need to, I think, he just was looking

4588
03:07:02.020 --> 03:07:04.060
a little weird.
MATT: But right now,

4589
03:07:04.060 --> 03:07:06.200
it does look like a very nice

4590
03:07:06.200 --> 03:07:09.200
boa right now with the fluffed up red hair.

4591
03:07:10.300 --> 03:07:12.640
LAURA: Thank you, Yasha.
ASHLEY: You're welcome.

4592
03:07:12.640 --> 03:07:14.920
TALIESIN: You look good, Sprinkle.
ASHLEY: It looks really good now.

4593
03:07:14.920 --> 03:07:17.020
It's like a really nice--
LAURA: Yeah.

4594
03:07:17.020 --> 03:07:18.370
MATT: Ding ga-ling-ling.
LAURA: Oh.

4595
03:07:19.240 --> 03:07:22.477
SAM: Company, family meeting, house meeting.

4596
03:07:22.477 --> 03:07:25.281
MATT: "Wow."

4597
03:07:25.281 --> 03:07:29.275
SAM: I've got to introduce you to your potential employers.

4598
03:07:29.275 --> 03:07:30.870
They might have some questions about

4599
03:07:30.870 --> 03:07:34.460
your CV and your past work experience.

4600
03:07:34.460 --> 03:07:35.370
MATT: "Of course, of course."

4601
03:07:35.370 --> 03:07:38.300
MARISHA: Nott, what the fuck?
SAM: No no, this is fine.

4602
03:07:38.300 --> 03:07:41.810
I've brought a young lady here, her name is Vendetta,

4603
03:07:41.810 --> 03:07:44.020
if I remember--
MARISHA: (yelling) Vendetta?!

4604
03:07:44.020 --> 03:07:45.660
SAM: I don't really remember, was it--

4605
03:07:45.660 --> 03:07:48.256
LAURA: What's your name?
MARISHA: Your name is Vendetta?

4606
03:07:48.256 --> 03:07:49.999
MATT: "That's not my--"
LAURA: Be nice.

4607
03:07:49.999 --> 03:07:51.803
MARISHA: What?

4608
03:07:51.803 --> 03:07:53.926
MATT: She introduces herself.

4609
03:07:53.926 --> 03:07:56.000
Do you guys have any particular questions, like,

4610
03:07:56.000 --> 03:07:59.170
I don't know how much time you want to spend on this.

4611
03:07:59.170 --> 03:08:01.430
LIAM: All of it.
MATT: Okay.

4612
03:08:01.430 --> 03:08:02.720
Yeah, totally.
LAURA: I just don't want her to

4613
03:08:02.720 --> 03:08:06.556
steal things from us.
MATT: Of course.

4614
03:08:06.556 --> 03:08:09.750
SAM: This could be our person who takes care of the home

4615
03:08:09.750 --> 03:08:11.210
when we are away.
LAURA: Oh, okay.

4616
03:08:11.210 --> 03:08:14.020
SAM: Because she, I know her qualifications are

4617
03:08:14.020 --> 03:08:17.580
she can use a broom and she speaks our language.

4618
03:08:17.580 --> 03:08:19.270
LAURA: Oh, that's wonderful.

4619
03:08:19.270 --> 03:08:21.710
Do you steal things?
MATT: "No.

4620
03:08:21.710 --> 03:08:23.480
"Why would I steal something?"
TRAVIS: Well, that's excellent.

4621
03:08:23.480 --> 03:08:24.600
We have the ability to monitor

4622
03:08:24.600 --> 03:08:26.620
every room in this house, so--

4623
03:08:26.620 --> 03:08:28.290
MARISHA: Why <i>wouldn't</i> you steal things?

4624
03:08:28.290 --> 03:08:29.710
SAM: Beau, what, what are you--

4625
03:08:29.710 --> 03:08:31.970
MARISHA: No, I mean, you only should trust someone

4626
03:08:31.970 --> 03:08:35.060
who knows that they could steal things, but then also has

4627
03:08:35.060 --> 03:08:36.743
the restraint and the loyalty

4628
03:08:36.743 --> 03:08:38.768
to know that they shouldn't.
LAURA: I'm going to cast Zone of Truth.

4629
03:08:38.768 --> 03:08:40.160
MATT: All right, you cast Zone of Truth.

4630
03:08:40.160 --> 03:08:42.770
LAURA: On, like, all of us, as many people that I can--

4631
03:08:42.770 --> 03:08:44.650
MATT: Everyone make wisdom saving throws.

4632
03:08:44.650 --> 03:08:45.834
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

4633
03:08:47.500 --> 03:08:49.654
SAM: 10.
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

4634
03:08:49.654 --> 03:08:50.804
LAURA: Aw.
LIAM: Oh.

4635
03:08:50.804 --> 03:08:51.637
MARISHA: 21.

4636
03:08:52.710 --> 03:08:53.690
LIAM: 13.
TRAVIS: Seven.

4637
03:08:55.130 --> 03:08:58.090
TALIESIN: I'm just going to lie
about everything because I can.

4638
03:08:58.090 --> 03:08:59.870
ASHLEY: Five.
LAURA: So Yasha,

4639
03:08:59.870 --> 03:09:02.050
Fjord, and Caleb--
SAM: And me.

4640
03:09:02.050 --> 03:09:04.460
LAURA: And Nott fail.
MATT: And so does she.

4641
03:09:04.460 --> 03:09:05.293
LAURA: Okay, good.

4642
03:09:07.660 --> 03:09:08.493
All right.

4643
03:09:09.760 --> 03:09:11.651
Are you trustworthy?

4644
03:09:11.651 --> 03:09:13.451
MATT: "I like to think so.

4645
03:09:13.451 --> 03:09:15.110
"This would be a better job than

4646
03:09:15.110 --> 03:09:17.220
"the one I currently have and--"

4647
03:09:17.220 --> 03:09:19.520
MARISHA: How much do you currently make?

4648
03:09:19.520 --> 03:09:22.527
MATT: "Currently, I make about, heh,

4649
03:09:24.260 --> 03:09:26.530
"four silver pieces a day."
SAM: Wait!

4650
03:09:26.530 --> 03:09:29.200
That, oh, interesting.
MARISHA: No, what?

4651
03:09:29.200 --> 03:09:30.110
SAM: No.
MARISHA: No, keep going.

4652
03:09:30.110 --> 03:09:31.150
LAURA: How much--
SAM: I was going to say--

4653
03:09:31.150 --> 03:09:32.930
MATT: "Cleaning--"
SAM: "Wait, that seems low."

4654
03:09:32.930 --> 03:09:35.241
MATT: "-- horse and moorbounder manure."

4655
03:09:35.241 --> 03:09:36.432
LAURA and SAM: Oh.

4656
03:09:36.432 --> 03:09:38.090
ASHLEY: Do you clean houses?

4657
03:09:38.090 --> 03:09:40.360
MATT: "I have before, but it's been some time."

4658
03:09:40.360 --> 03:09:42.210
TRAVIS: You guys got this?
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

4659
03:09:42.210 --> 03:09:43.043
TRAVIS: Okay, good.
SAM: Don't you want to

4660
03:09:43.043 --> 03:09:44.440
ask something?
TRAVIS: No, I'm good.

4661
03:09:44.440 --> 03:09:46.450
SAM: What do you mean you're good?

4662
03:09:46.450 --> 03:09:48.280
TRAVIS: Do we all need to be here as we interview

4663
03:09:48.280 --> 03:09:50.130
the housekeeper?
SAM: Yes!

4664
03:09:50.130 --> 03:09:51.320
This is a house meeting.

4665
03:09:51.320 --> 03:09:53.290
I said house meeting, that means the whole house.

4666
03:09:53.290 --> 03:09:55.273
LAURA: What's your biggest fear?

4667
03:09:55.273 --> 03:09:58.390
TALIESIN: Do you have any experience
taking care of houseplants?

4668
03:10:01.038 --> 03:10:03.760
MATT: "(thoughtful humming)

4669
03:10:03.760 --> 03:10:04.960
"No."

4670
03:10:04.960 --> 03:10:07.780
TALIESIN: Do you feel prepared to learn
how to take care of plants?

4671
03:10:07.780 --> 03:10:10.227
MATT: "I think so."
TALIESIN: Okay.

4672
03:10:10.227 --> 03:10:12.652
LAURA: Do you like me?

4673
03:10:12.652 --> 03:10:14.160
MATT: "You seem...

4674
03:10:15.502 --> 03:10:17.960
"aggressively likable."

4675
03:10:17.960 --> 03:10:18.885
SAM: I like you.

4676
03:10:18.885 --> 03:10:20.690
ASHLEY: Are you afraid of weasels?

4677
03:10:20.690 --> 03:10:22.289
MATT: "Why?"

4678
03:10:22.289 --> 03:10:24.160
MARISHA: She's afraid of weasels.

4679
03:10:24.160 --> 03:10:25.510
What's your favorite color?

4680
03:10:27.150 --> 03:10:29.010
MATT: "Blue?"
LAURA: What's your favorite color?

4681
03:10:29.010 --> 03:10:30.760
MARISHA: Green.
TRAVIS: Who are you asking?

4682
03:10:30.760 --> 03:10:32.934
LAURA: You.
TRAVIS: Oh, blue.

4683
03:10:32.934 --> 03:10:34.069
MARISHA: Green.

4684
03:10:34.069 --> 03:10:36.419
LAURA: What's your favorite color?

4685
03:10:36.419 --> 03:10:38.485
LIAM: Oh, I don't have one.

4686
03:10:38.485 --> 03:10:40.102
SAM: Oh, that's weird.

4687
03:10:40.102 --> 03:10:42.102
MARISHA: Wait, you don't have one?

4688
03:10:42.102 --> 03:10:43.318
SAM: That is weird.

4689
03:10:43.318 --> 03:10:45.810
I mean, I've known you for so long and that is

4690
03:10:45.810 --> 03:10:47.190
the weirdest thing--
LAURA: Nott, favorite color.

4691
03:10:47.190 --> 03:10:49.832
SAM: Yellow.
LAURA: Oh, well.

4692
03:10:49.832 --> 03:10:50.974
TALIESIN: I don't pick favorites.

4693
03:10:50.974 --> 03:10:52.850
MARISHA: But how do you see the world?

4694
03:10:52.850 --> 03:10:55.010
ASHLEY: Silver.
TRAVIS: Silver?

4695
03:10:55.010 --> 03:10:56.893
ASHLEY: Yeah.
LAURA: That's a good color.

4696
03:10:56.893 --> 03:10:58.751
TRAVIS: What about yours, Jester?
LAURA: Pink.

4697
03:10:58.751 --> 03:11:00.830
LIAM: How do I see color, is that what you're asking?

4698
03:11:00.830 --> 03:11:02.740
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: We might have some

4699
03:11:02.740 --> 03:11:04.790
important thing we need to get to if, you know--

4700
03:11:04.790 --> 03:11:07.130
SAM: Yeah, yeah, you're totally right.

4701
03:11:07.130 --> 03:11:09.390
LAURA: Does anybody have a crush on me?

4702
03:11:09.390 --> 03:11:10.223
SAM: Oh.

4703
03:11:10.223 --> 03:11:13.189
MARISHA: Jester, you know everyone does.

4704
03:11:13.189 --> 03:11:14.222
LAURA: What? No.

4705
03:11:14.222 --> 03:11:16.163
MARISHA: Okay, back to <i>you</i>, though.

4706
03:11:17.090 --> 03:11:20.660
What's the most expensive silverware you've ever stolen?

4707
03:11:20.660 --> 03:11:22.001
MATT: "I've never stolen sil--"

4708
03:11:22.001 --> 03:11:23.318
MARISHA: Lies. She's lying.
LAURA: No she's not,

4709
03:11:23.318 --> 03:11:24.160
she's telling the truth.

4710
03:11:24.160 --> 03:11:26.110
MARISHA: You're right, she's telling the truth.

4711
03:11:27.190 --> 03:11:28.352
What did you tell,

4712
03:11:28.352 --> 03:11:31.327
(laughter)

4713
03:11:31.327 --> 03:11:33.477
what did you tell her?

4714
03:11:33.477 --> 03:11:36.282
LAURA: What are you talking about? Beau, are you drunk?

4715
03:11:36.282 --> 03:11:38.030
TRAVIS: (sighing)

4716
03:11:38.030 --> 03:11:40.240
MARISHA: I don't trust her.

4717
03:11:40.240 --> 03:11:42.454
MATT: "If you don't trust me, I can go."

4718
03:11:42.454 --> 03:11:44.340
LAURA: No, no, no, no--
SAM: Let's put it to a vote.

4719
03:11:44.340 --> 03:11:45.880
TRAVIS: Yes, let's vote.
SAM: All in favor--

4720
03:11:45.880 --> 03:11:47.050
LAURA: Do you have good intentions here?

4721
03:11:47.050 --> 03:11:48.480
Do you want to keep a job here?

4722
03:11:48.480 --> 03:11:50.230
Are you going to try to do anything shady?

4723
03:11:50.230 --> 03:11:52.350
TRAVIS: Those are different--
LAURA: Yeah, but--

4724
03:11:54.490 --> 03:11:57.606
MATT: "I would like, I have good intentions,

4725
03:11:57.606 --> 03:11:59.797
"I would like to, you know,

4726
03:11:59.797 --> 03:12:02.205
"live above the current means that I do.

4727
03:12:04.040 --> 03:12:08.750
"If you are people that are very difficult to work with

4728
03:12:08.750 --> 03:12:10.620
"and keep, then I wouldn't stay in this job."

4729
03:12:10.620 --> 03:12:11.600
TRAVIS: We're not, we're never here.

4730
03:12:11.600 --> 03:12:13.110
Let's vote, all in favor.

4731
03:12:14.228 --> 03:12:15.708
SAM: Yeah, of course.
TRAVIS: Hey, you're hired.

4732
03:12:15.708 --> 03:12:17.070
Congratulations, when can you start?

4733
03:12:17.070 --> 03:12:18.370
TALIESIN: How much do you make?

4734
03:12:18.370 --> 03:12:21.430
MATT: "We had discussed 40 gold
each month for the housekeeping--"

4735
03:12:21.430 --> 03:12:23.140
TRAVIS: Holy fucking shit--
MARISHA: Nott,

4736
03:12:23.140 --> 03:12:25.620
that's what I'm talking about, that's what--

4737
03:12:25.620 --> 03:12:26.453
SAM: What's wrong with that?

4738
03:12:26.453 --> 03:12:28.519
TRAVIS: Maybe she drove a hard bargain.
MARISHA: It's insane.

4739
03:12:28.519 --> 03:12:30.594
SAM: Is that insane? We have lots of money.

4740
03:12:30.594 --> 03:12:32.890
MARISHA: She currently makes four silver.

4741
03:12:32.890 --> 03:12:37.180
LAURA: Is that high, did you quote
something very high for us?

4742
03:12:37.180 --> 03:12:39.680
MATT: "It would be better than what I'm making now at the--"

4743
03:12:39.680 --> 03:12:43.105
MARISHA: Yeah, by, like, 5,000%!
MATT: "-- stables."

4744
03:12:43.105 --> 03:12:45.550
TRAVIS: We'll pay it, you're hired, you start today.

4745
03:12:45.550 --> 03:12:47.280
MATT: "Thank you very much.

4746
03:12:47.280 --> 03:12:48.460
"I'll get my stuff."

4747
03:12:48.460 --> 03:12:50.910
MARISHA: She's a grifter, I can smell it on her.

4748
03:12:50.910 --> 03:12:54.020
One recognizes one of their own, all right?

4749
03:12:54.020 --> 03:12:56.128
SAM: You say that about literally everyone we meet.

4750
03:12:56.128 --> 03:12:57.903
TRAVIS: Yeah, you're projecting super hard right now.

4751
03:12:57.903 --> 03:12:59.598
MARISHA: Yeah, you're probably right.

4752
03:12:59.598 --> 03:13:01.300
TRAVIS: All right.

4753
03:13:01.300 --> 03:13:02.390
Take care of the house.

4754
03:13:02.390 --> 03:13:04.705
We don't have any keys, guard the door with your life.

4755
03:13:04.705 --> 03:13:06.220
(laughter)

4756
03:13:06.220 --> 03:13:08.210
MATT: "Am I starting now or tomorrow?"

4757
03:13:08.210 --> 03:13:10.430
SAM: Immediately.
LAURA: Yeah, you can start right away.

4758
03:13:10.430 --> 03:13:12.398
SAM: You sleep in the hot tub at night.

4759
03:13:12.398 --> 03:13:14.600
LAURA: No, no. She's lying.

4760
03:13:14.600 --> 03:13:15.800
TRAVIS: You can't speak to your previous employers.

4761
03:13:15.800 --> 03:13:18.142
If you do, they'll be killed.
SAM: That was a joke,

4762
03:13:18.142 --> 03:13:20.264
it wasn't a lie. (laughs)
TRAVIS: That's not true,

4763
03:13:20.264 --> 03:13:22.950
I can't say that. (laughs)
MATT: "Okay."

4764
03:13:22.950 --> 03:13:25.900
TRAVIS: Sort of true.
MATT: "This is very strange house."

4765
03:13:25.900 --> 03:13:27.970
TALIESIN: We're aware.
TRAVIS: We're glad you're here.

4766
03:13:27.970 --> 03:13:29.390
Can we go now?
SAM: Yeah.

4767
03:13:29.390 --> 03:13:31.720
We're going to--
TRAVIS: Essek.

4768
03:13:31.720 --> 03:13:33.670
SAM: Oh, to Essek.
MATT: Are you leaving now?

4769
03:13:34.740 --> 03:13:36.390
Just asking, it's up to you guys.

4770
03:13:39.760 --> 03:13:41.130
LIAM: I mean, what else are we going to do?

4771
03:13:41.130 --> 03:13:43.130
SAM: Yeah, let's go.
LAURA: Yeah, we should just go.

4772
03:13:43.130 --> 03:13:44.800
LIAM: Thank you, watch the place.

4773
03:13:44.800 --> 03:13:45.980
TALIESIN: There's instructions on how to

4774
03:13:45.980 --> 03:13:48.804
take care of the plants in the kitchen.
LIAM: We have no belongings, so.

4775
03:13:48.804 --> 03:13:49.637
MATT: Okay.

4776
03:13:49.637 --> 03:13:51.420
LAURA: I have a question.
MATT: Yes.

4777
03:13:51.420 --> 03:13:53.260
LAURA: If I cast something from a wand,

4778
03:13:53.260 --> 03:13:55.210
do I need the spell components for it

4779
03:13:55.210 --> 03:13:57.310
or does it cancel it because I have a wand?

4780
03:13:58.400 --> 03:14:02.704
MATT: It'll usually say for most wand-based magical items,

4781
03:14:02.704 --> 03:14:05.140
"Without material components."
LAURA: Okay.

4782
03:14:05.140 --> 03:14:06.800
MATT: I think the wand handles it, I don't think

4783
03:14:06.800 --> 03:14:08.060
you need the components for the wand--

4784
03:14:08.060 --> 03:14:09.580
LAURA: Got it, okay.

4785
03:14:09.580 --> 03:14:13.270
TRAVIS: What wand do you have?
MATT: Pretty sure.

4786
03:14:13.270 --> 03:14:15.760
LAURA: I have the Wand of the Solitary Scout

4787
03:14:15.760 --> 03:14:16.830
and I have the Wand of Smiles.

4788
03:14:16.830 --> 03:14:19.460
MATT: You don't the guano if you're using

4789
03:14:19.460 --> 03:14:21.190
a Wand of Fireballs or anything,

4790
03:14:21.190 --> 03:14:23.060
it's part of the enchantment that the wand handles it,

4791
03:14:23.060 --> 03:14:25.810
I'm pretty sure.
TALIESIN: Wands a--

4792
03:14:25.810 --> 03:14:29.330
LIAM: It's rolled in the phosphorus like a churro.

4793
03:14:29.330 --> 03:14:32.260
MATT: "I will get my things and begin immediately."

4794
03:14:32.260 --> 03:14:35.480
TALIESIN: We have quarters for that, right?
MATT: "Pleasure to meet you."

4795
03:14:35.480 --> 03:14:37.660
LAURA: Yeah, there's an extra room.

4796
03:14:37.660 --> 03:14:39.200
TALIESIN: That makes life easier.
ASHLEY: What was her name again?

4797
03:14:39.200 --> 03:14:40.430
SAM: You know what?
LAURA: No, really,

4798
03:14:40.430 --> 03:14:41.660
what was your name?
SAM: I don't remember--

4799
03:14:41.660 --> 03:14:42.570
And I'm not sure

4800
03:14:42.570 --> 03:14:44.650
that Matt does either.
MATT: I literally said it

4801
03:14:44.650 --> 03:14:45.760
on the spot and forgot to write it down,

4802
03:14:45.760 --> 03:14:47.830
not so much help on that.
TRAVIS: Vendetta, it's Vendetta.

4803
03:14:47.830 --> 03:14:50.820
SAM: You know what, we'll ask her when she gets back.

4804
03:14:50.820 --> 03:14:52.342
I can't ask her--
ASHLEY: We'll ask again later.

4805
03:14:52.342 --> 03:14:55.507
MATT: I think it's Vidalla or something, I should've--

4806
03:14:55.507 --> 03:14:58.605
I'm usually good about writing it down
and I'll find it out tomorrow.

4807
03:14:58.605 --> 03:15:00.660
SAM: I can't ask her because she'll know I didn't remember,

4808
03:15:00.660 --> 03:15:02.260
so one of you ask her, all right?

4809
03:15:02.260 --> 03:15:03.350
LAURA: Vidalla.
MATT: Vidalla.

4810
03:15:03.350 --> 03:15:04.850
All right, so I wasn't too far off.

4811
03:15:05.800 --> 03:15:08.930
MARISHA: No one self-names themselves Vendetta

4812
03:15:08.930 --> 03:15:11.530
without issues.

4813
03:15:11.530 --> 03:15:14.660
LAURA: Yay, we have somebody working for us.

4814
03:15:14.660 --> 03:15:16.460
That's pretty cool.

4815
03:15:16.460 --> 03:15:17.740
SAM: You're welcome.

4816
03:15:17.740 --> 03:15:18.640
TRAVIS: Nicely done.
LAURA: That was

4817
03:15:18.640 --> 03:15:21.080
a really high price, though, because, you know,

4818
03:15:21.080 --> 03:15:24.400
we have people that clean up my mom's quarters and stuff

4819
03:15:24.400 --> 03:15:26.760
and they cost way less than that.

4820
03:15:26.760 --> 03:15:28.872
SAM: Well--
LAURA: I think.

4821
03:15:30.849 --> 03:15:33.490
SAM: I mean, doesn't matter to me.

4822
03:15:33.490 --> 03:15:35.630
Because we're all splitting it, so.

4823
03:15:35.630 --> 03:15:38.190
TALIESIN: No, no we're not, that's okay.

4824
03:15:38.190 --> 03:15:39.830
LAURA: Yeah, we can split it if you want.

4825
03:15:39.830 --> 03:15:41.600
TRAVIS: Oh yes, Essek?

4826
03:15:41.600 --> 03:15:42.750
Oh, we'll be right there.

4827
03:15:42.750 --> 03:15:44.050
It's quite urgent that we get to his place.

4828
03:15:44.050 --> 03:15:44.883
SAM: He's messaging you?

4829
03:15:44.883 --> 03:15:46.890
All right, let's go.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

4830
03:15:46.890 --> 03:15:48.303
MATT: All right.

4831
03:15:48.303 --> 03:15:50.553
(laughter)

4832
03:15:55.370 --> 03:15:56.410
You head your way over toward

4833
03:15:56.410 --> 03:15:58.920
Essek's home after finishing up here.

4834
03:16:00.030 --> 03:16:02.880
You head to his familiar towers where you had

4835
03:16:02.880 --> 03:16:06.540
previously enjoyed the cheese and crackers provided to you.

4836
03:16:08.030 --> 03:16:09.120
You're greeted by Essek, who leads you

4837
03:16:09.120 --> 03:16:11.010
back into the interior.

4838
03:16:11.010 --> 03:16:14.380
"Well, I was not expecting you to return to Rosohna so soon.

4839
03:16:14.380 --> 03:16:17.630
"I take it your journey was successful?"

4840
03:16:17.630 --> 03:16:19.190
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: We believe so, yes.

4841
03:16:19.190 --> 03:16:21.642
LAURA: Should we try the spell again before we go?

4842
03:16:21.642 --> 03:16:24.520
SAM: I mean, I haven't even really meditated about it yet.

4843
03:16:24.520 --> 03:16:27.760
LAURA: Oh, you're right, okay.

4844
03:16:27.760 --> 03:16:31.050
MATT: "Well, you said you needed to travel somewhere, so."

4845
03:16:32.080 --> 03:16:36.170
LAURA: Yes, is it okay?
MATT: "Yes, it's okay."

4846
03:16:36.170 --> 03:16:39.526
"I, (chuckles) you know,

4847
03:16:39.526 --> 03:16:42.480
"it prevents me from some of

4848
03:16:42.480 --> 03:16:46.440
"my capabilities throughout the day each time I do this,

4849
03:16:46.440 --> 03:16:49.700
"so while I'm here in my home and things are

4850
03:16:49.700 --> 03:16:53.290
"not requiring me to be elsewhere rapidly,

4851
03:16:53.290 --> 03:16:55.230
"thankfully this is a moment in time

4852
03:16:55.230 --> 03:17:00.230
"in which I am more useful here in the city."

4853
03:17:00.230 --> 03:17:01.810
TRAVIS: It's greatly appreciated.

4854
03:17:04.100 --> 03:17:08.560
MATT: "I'm sure we'll find a way to
balance the scales some time."

4855
03:17:08.560 --> 03:17:10.840
LIAM: Is there any news on your end?

4856
03:17:12.010 --> 03:17:17.000
MATT: "What I know is many of the (sighs) many of the

4857
03:17:17.000 --> 03:17:20.260
"elements of the military on both sides are holding

4858
03:17:20.260 --> 03:17:25.260
"hard lines at the exterior of previous battlefields.

4859
03:17:26.460 --> 03:17:28.920
"There has been some small scale negotiation

4860
03:17:28.920 --> 03:17:32.170
"and discussion as far as preparation for this gathering.

4861
03:17:32.170 --> 03:17:34.640
"Ships have already set out with

4862
03:17:34.640 --> 03:17:38.420
"the prisoner from one of our outposts.

4863
03:17:38.420 --> 03:17:43.415
"It is quite a long trek from our side of Wynandir.

4864
03:17:44.466 --> 03:17:47.360
"I believe the same has begun traveling from

4865
03:17:47.360 --> 03:17:51.240
"the Dwendalian Empire to eventually

4866
03:17:51.240 --> 03:17:53.240
"find its way toward the Menagerie Coast."

4867
03:17:54.200 --> 03:17:56.940
LAURA: Are we going to miss the negotiation?

4868
03:17:56.940 --> 03:17:58.880
SAM: It takes weeks.
MATT: "The negotiation is about

4869
03:17:58.880 --> 03:18:00.570
"three, three and a half weeks from now,

4870
03:18:00.570 --> 03:18:01.880
"I believe."
LAURA: Okay.

4871
03:18:01.880 --> 03:18:04.590
MATT: "As long as you can ensure your return by then.

4872
03:18:06.080 --> 03:18:08.180
"Otherwise, it'll just have to continue without you."

4873
03:18:08.180 --> 03:18:09.885
LAURA: Wow, okay.
MARISHA: It's that

4874
03:18:09.885 --> 03:18:13.786
and then Traveler Con is days later?

4875
03:18:13.786 --> 03:18:17.810
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: It's pretty rapidly after.

4876
03:18:17.810 --> 03:18:19.380
SAM: We'll be close.
MATT: That's less than a week

4877
03:18:19.380 --> 03:18:21.390
after where the negotiation is set

4878
03:18:21.390 --> 03:18:22.950
is when Traveler Con's probably going to happen, so.

4879
03:18:22.950 --> 03:18:26.370
TRAVIS: The volcano's out in the water, too.

4880
03:18:26.370 --> 03:18:27.300
MATT: "So where would you like me

4881
03:18:27.300 --> 03:18:28.840
"to take you?"
TRAVIS: Caduceus?

4882
03:18:30.010 --> 03:18:33.430
TALIESIN: Oh, we're going to--
TRAVIS: The menagerie.

4883
03:18:33.430 --> 03:18:34.770
It's a vast space, yes?

4884
03:18:34.770 --> 03:18:36.770
So somewhere more specific?
LAURA: Can you describe

4885
03:18:36.770 --> 03:18:39.550
exactly where we're going?
TALIESIN: No, I've never been there.

4886
03:18:39.550 --> 03:18:41.370
LAURA: Oh.
SAM: Didn't you say

4887
03:18:41.370 --> 03:18:42.590
it was near the forest that we

4888
03:18:42.590 --> 03:18:43.890
have been to?
TALIESIN: No.

4889
03:18:44.930 --> 03:18:48.220
MATT: "Do you not know where I'm supposed to be taking you?

4890
03:18:48.220 --> 03:18:51.203
"That is-- That is impossible."

4891
03:18:51.203 --> 03:18:53.807
LAURA: No, we know, we know where we're going.
TALIESIN: I know the name of it.

4892
03:18:53.807 --> 03:18:55.610
SAM: It was the high, it was the forest down,

4893
03:18:55.610 --> 03:18:59.250
that's the wrong map.
TALIESIN: Wrong map.

4894
03:18:59.250 --> 03:19:01.110
TRAVIS: Is it this one?
LAURA: Nope.

4895
03:19:01.110 --> 03:19:05.443
We need Xhorhas. It's right there, it's right there.

4896
03:19:07.306 --> 03:19:09.822
SAM: ♪ Get out the map. ♪

4897
03:19:09.822 --> 03:19:12.490
ASHLEY: Are you sure it was this one?
TALIESIN: Thank you.

4898
03:19:12.490 --> 03:19:15.080
LAURA: Yeah, it's, yeah, it's over here.

4899
03:19:15.080 --> 03:19:16.730
SAM and TALIESIN: Down here.

4900
03:19:16.730 --> 03:19:18.900
TALIESIN: Whitedawn Lagoon, if I recall.

4901
03:19:18.900 --> 03:19:21.100
Is that where we're--
MATT: "Whitedawn Lagoon, right.

4902
03:19:21.100 --> 03:19:25.570
"Okay, I've not been there, but I know of its existence,

4903
03:19:25.570 --> 03:19:30.537
"that puts us in a possible chance of arriving."

4904
03:19:32.950 --> 03:19:35.880
LIAM: Are we gambling with fate by going--

4905
03:19:35.880 --> 03:19:38.410
LAURA: Should I scry on the Whitedawn Lagoon?

4906
03:19:38.410 --> 03:19:40.450
Can I scry-- I can't scry on a location.

4907
03:19:40.450 --> 03:19:42.100
I always forget this.

4908
03:19:42.980 --> 03:19:45.670
I don't have it prepared anyway.

4909
03:19:45.670 --> 03:19:49.000
MATT: "I don't have it prepared either, so I could not,

4910
03:19:49.000 --> 03:19:51.070
"it would be helpful to me to do so.

4911
03:19:51.070 --> 03:19:53.600
"Which means we can either go now and chance it

4912
03:19:53.600 --> 03:19:55.830
"or we can try tomorrow."
SAM: Let's chance it.

4913
03:19:55.830 --> 03:19:57.730
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Chance it!

4914
03:19:57.730 --> 03:20:00.064
TRAVIS: What's life without a little risk?

4915
03:20:00.064 --> 03:20:01.170
TALIESIN: So much can go wrong with this.

4916
03:20:01.170 --> 03:20:03.120
MATT: "Of course, but so much can go
wrong with all sorts of--"

4917
03:20:03.120 --> 03:20:04.890
TALIESIN: That's so true.
MATT: "-- elements of magic.

4918
03:20:04.890 --> 03:20:07.540
"Exciting, though, as we've experienced together

4919
03:20:07.540 --> 03:20:10.480
"once before, sometimes painful."

4920
03:20:11.680 --> 03:20:14.500
LAURA: Mm-hmm.
MATT: "But if you insist.

4921
03:20:14.500 --> 03:20:16.585
"Let us all take hands, if you are ready."

4922
03:20:16.585 --> 03:20:18.560
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

4923
03:20:18.560 --> 03:20:23.050
Just for fun, I'm going to make a prayer for everything

4924
03:20:23.050 --> 03:20:25.590
to go well.
LAURA: Oh!

4925
03:20:28.117 --> 03:20:29.500
TALIESIN: Nope.

4926
03:20:29.500 --> 03:20:31.750
(laughter)

4927
03:20:33.026 --> 03:20:35.953
MATT: The Wildmother is silent.
LAURA: I'm going to--

4928
03:20:35.953 --> 03:20:37.774
TALIESIN: It was a long shot.

4929
03:20:37.774 --> 03:20:40.102
LAURA: Put my hands on Essek's shoulder

4930
03:20:40.102 --> 03:20:41.780
and I'm going to say:

4931
03:20:41.780 --> 03:20:44.138
The Traveler is with you, my child.

4932
03:20:46.630 --> 03:20:49.963
MATT: "Thank you, Jester."
LAURA: Yeah.

4933
03:20:51.064 --> 03:20:53.420
MATT: "Come, come," and he glides over into

4934
03:20:53.420 --> 03:20:58.420
the center of his main chamber.

4935
03:20:58.610 --> 03:20:59.840
As he moves that way,

4936
03:20:59.840 --> 03:21:02.550
the furniture (scraping) scoots

4937
03:21:02.550 --> 03:21:05.940
on its own to the sides and leaves the open space.

4938
03:21:05.940 --> 03:21:08.960
Puts his hands out.

4939
03:21:08.960 --> 03:21:12.260
You all clasp hands and he goes, "Whitedawn Lagoon.

4940
03:21:14.460 --> 03:21:16.170
"Fingers crossed."

4941
03:21:16.170 --> 03:21:19.410
(whispers) And as he begins to finish incantations,

4942
03:21:19.410 --> 03:21:22.760
you can hear the voice echoes growing louder and louder.

4943
03:21:22.760 --> 03:21:24.360
You can see on the ground between your feet

4944
03:21:24.360 --> 03:21:27.284
these little light gray lines begin to

4945
03:21:27.284 --> 03:21:29.930
(whooshing) connect you all in the center.

4946
03:21:29.930 --> 03:21:31.270
As it grows brighter and brighter and then

4947
03:21:31.270 --> 03:21:32.980
you feel that familiar sound of

4948
03:21:32.980 --> 03:21:36.820
you all being pulled into nothingness.

4949
03:21:36.820 --> 03:21:39.460
I need somebody to roll a D100 for me.

4950
03:21:40.400 --> 03:21:42.900
MARISHA: Taliesin--
TRAVIS: Tal do it, yeah.

4951
03:21:44.900 --> 03:21:46.300
LAURA: Ho.
TALIESIN: That's

4952
03:21:47.750 --> 03:21:49.280
99.

4953
03:21:49.280 --> 03:21:50.113
SAM: Whoa.
TRAVIS: It is?

4954
03:21:50.113 --> 03:21:51.870
MARISHA: Is that good or bad?
LAURA: Yeah, it's 99.

4955
03:21:51.870 --> 03:21:53.970
TALIESIN: I don't know.
MATT: Hold on.

4956
03:21:53.970 --> 03:21:56.645
TALIESIN: I'm trying to cast Divine Inspiration,

4957
03:21:56.645 --> 03:21:57.780
that would have been amazing.

4958
03:21:57.780 --> 03:21:59.010
MARISHA: Yeah.

4959
03:21:59.010 --> 03:22:01.707
TALIESIN: If I rolled that last time,
that would have been crazy.

4960
03:22:01.707 --> 03:22:03.815
(chuckling)

4961
03:22:03.815 --> 03:22:06.030
TRAVIS: Mercer's early page turning is interesting.

4962
03:22:06.030 --> 03:22:07.810
MATT: ♪ Think that's-- ♪
TALIESIN: I have to roll, like, 11?

4963
03:22:07.810 --> 03:22:09.480
TRAVIS: Super bad.

4964
03:22:09.480 --> 03:22:11.760
MATT: ♪ Not good. ♪
LAURA: Not good, that's not good?

4965
03:22:11.760 --> 03:22:12.733
MATT: No, actually, it's really good.

4966
03:22:12.733 --> 03:22:13.909
LAURA: Oh, okay.
MARISHA: It's really good?

4967
03:22:13.909 --> 03:22:14.742
MATT: That is on target.

4968
03:22:15.726 --> 03:22:16.834
ASHLEY: Oh wow.
LAURA: That's super duper

4969
03:22:16.834 --> 03:22:18.904
on target, right?
TRAVIS: It's one way or the other.

4970
03:22:18.904 --> 03:22:22.906
MATT: You had a 25% of this succeeding. (laughs)

4971
03:22:22.906 --> 03:22:24.853
(surprised murmuring)

4972
03:22:24.853 --> 03:22:25.790
Because this is only based on a description,

4973
03:22:25.790 --> 03:22:26.940
he's not even viewed it before.

4974
03:22:26.940 --> 03:22:29.330
LAURA: Oh jeez louise.
MATT: There's a 43% chance

4975
03:22:29.330 --> 03:22:32.310
for a mishap on that one, but you rolled a 99.

4976
03:22:32.310 --> 03:22:34.470
TALIESIN: I rolled a, look at that, that's really pretty.

4977
03:22:34.470 --> 03:22:35.778
Those are the dice you got me, by the way--

4978
03:22:35.778 --> 03:22:37.078
LAURA: Yeah!

4979
03:22:38.838 --> 03:22:40.604
TALIESIN: They've been good dice.
LAURA: Good.

4980
03:22:40.604 --> 03:22:42.453
TALIESIN: They've been really good.

4981
03:22:44.160 --> 03:22:47.750
MATT: You all suddenly go from the cold night

4982
03:22:47.750 --> 03:22:51.400
to the bright midday sun of a bluer sky above.

4983
03:22:51.400 --> 03:22:52.920
You can see most of the clouds that

4984
03:22:52.920 --> 03:22:55.800
you're used to seeing in the Dwendalian Empire not there,

4985
03:22:55.800 --> 03:22:59.030
aside from a few small plumes of white across the horizon.

4986
03:22:59.030 --> 03:23:02.240
You are partially looking out to

4987
03:23:02.240 --> 03:23:07.240
a green grassy stretch of hill

4988
03:23:07.851 --> 03:23:12.851
that then vanishes before you see ocean to the south,

4989
03:23:13.160 --> 03:23:15.862
the glittering waters of the Lucidian Ocean.

4990
03:23:17.310 --> 03:23:20.110
You look to your right and behind you

4991
03:23:20.110 --> 03:23:22.230
and you can see the elements of a mountain range

4992
03:23:22.230 --> 03:23:26.420
that vanish to the north, broken gray rocks

4993
03:23:26.420 --> 03:23:29.260
and it looks like a deep ravine that begins to

4994
03:23:29.260 --> 03:23:32.650
carve its way northward from where you stand.

4995
03:23:32.650 --> 03:23:33.970
It's a number of miles away,

4996
03:23:33.970 --> 03:23:36.400
it's barely visible on the horizon.

4997
03:23:36.400 --> 03:23:41.400
But immediately before you, you can see this vast jungle,

4998
03:23:43.470 --> 03:23:48.380
this dense tropical forest that seems to wrap around

4999
03:23:48.380 --> 03:23:50.150
and encompass a large portion

5000
03:23:50.150 --> 03:23:54.744
of this shore-side cliff expanse.

5001
03:23:57.540 --> 03:23:59.790
You assume that you're probably pretty close to

5002
03:23:59.790 --> 03:24:03.513
or right at the area known as the Whitedawn Lagoon.

5003
03:24:04.820 --> 03:24:07.028
Essek immediately goes, "Ahh.

5004
03:24:08.120 --> 03:24:10.220
"Ah, I think this was a success."

5005
03:24:10.220 --> 03:24:11.960
TALIESIN: This looks about right.

5006
03:24:11.960 --> 03:24:14.190
LAURA: When was the last time you saw the sun?

5007
03:24:14.190 --> 03:24:18.500
MATT: "It's been a number of, I think probably since

5008
03:24:18.500 --> 03:24:21.570
"the last time I took you somewhere this bright."

5009
03:24:21.570 --> 03:24:22.990
SAM: Does it hurt you?

5010
03:24:22.990 --> 03:24:27.610
MATT: "It's not comfortable, but it is tolerable.

5011
03:24:30.491 --> 03:24:32.390
"Is this what you were seeking?"

5012
03:24:33.630 --> 03:24:37.730
TALIESIN: Does this mountain range
look familiar from my vision?

5013
03:24:37.730 --> 03:24:39.770
MATT: The mountain range isn't familiar to you,

5014
03:24:39.770 --> 03:24:41.890
but the visions you've had definitely,

5015
03:24:41.890 --> 03:24:46.890
your visions specifically are of an oasis

5016
03:24:46.940 --> 03:24:48.700
in the middle of a jungle.
TALIESIN: Sure.

5017
03:24:48.700 --> 03:24:50.830
MATT: You don't know which one or where.

5018
03:24:50.830 --> 03:24:53.320
And so, none of this is familiar to you,

5019
03:24:53.320 --> 03:24:55.480
but you seem to have been brought to where you requested.

5020
03:24:55.480 --> 03:24:59.290
LAURA: I get down on the ground and paint a parasol

5021
03:24:59.290 --> 03:25:01.362
and pop it out and go, (opening).

5022
03:25:01.362 --> 03:25:03.612
(laughter)

5023
03:25:05.970 --> 03:25:07.769
MATT: "Thank you, Jester."
LAURA: You're welcome.

5024
03:25:07.769 --> 03:25:10.902
MARISHA: He's so cute with his parasol.

5025
03:25:10.902 --> 03:25:12.752
TRAVIS: There's dicks on each of the panels.

5026
03:25:12.752 --> 03:25:15.302
LAURA: He's floating with his parasol?

5027
03:25:15.302 --> 03:25:16.949
He's Mary Poppins, y'all!

5028
03:25:16.949 --> 03:25:19.601
(laughter)

5029
03:25:19.601 --> 03:25:21.860
TALIESIN: I'm going to sit down, send out a little,

5030
03:25:21.860 --> 03:25:23.830
I'm going to face the mountains.

5031
03:25:23.830 --> 03:25:25.570
There's a jungle, I assume, in front of us.

5032
03:25:25.570 --> 03:25:26.420
MATT: Yes.

5033
03:25:29.599 --> 03:25:31.055
TALIESIN: And

5034
03:25:33.280 --> 03:25:35.434
I'm going to cast

5035
03:25:38.450 --> 03:25:40.029
Commune.

5036
03:25:42.100 --> 03:25:42.933
MATT: Okay.

5037
03:25:43.825 --> 03:25:47.525
TRAVIS: I'll sit down off and to his right, behind him.

5038
03:25:48.380 --> 03:25:52.153
MATT: Okay, lend your presence to the Commune as well?

5039
03:25:52.153 --> 03:25:54.820
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.
MATT: You got it.

5040
03:26:00.040 --> 03:26:01.840
TALIESIN: Does my destination lie before me?

5041
03:26:03.130 --> 03:26:05.900
MATT: As you focus, all of you feel

5042
03:26:05.900 --> 03:26:10.900
the still air become a warm seaside breeze,

5043
03:26:11.720 --> 03:26:14.630
a welcome shift from the colder climates

5044
03:26:14.630 --> 03:26:16.620
which you've traversed as of late,

5045
03:26:16.620 --> 03:26:18.930
and familiar to those who grew up in the Menagerie Coast.

5046
03:26:18.930 --> 03:26:22.770
This further south on Xhorhas definitely resembles

5047
03:26:22.770 --> 03:26:26.010
the places where you two grew up.

5048
03:26:26.010 --> 03:26:29.180
As the warm wind blows through, (blows)

5049
03:26:30.140 --> 03:26:35.133
you get a sweet smell, a familiar smell, this

5050
03:26:36.611 --> 03:26:41.158
sweet, honeysuckle-like flower aroma

5051
03:26:41.158 --> 03:26:43.180
that reminds you of times in your youth

5052
03:26:43.180 --> 03:26:45.930
when you were on the right path

5053
03:26:45.930 --> 03:26:49.830
and the wind blows in the direction of the jungle

5054
03:26:49.830 --> 03:26:54.680
in front of you, the trees the swaying inward. (blows)

5055
03:26:59.370 --> 03:27:01.295
TALIESIN: Is it under a day's walk?

5056
03:27:02.630 --> 03:27:05.930
MATT: The breeze comes to a still.

5057
03:27:05.930 --> 03:27:08.080
Still blowing, but gentler.

5058
03:27:08.080 --> 03:27:11.027
You get the sense that the answer is inconclusive.

5059
03:27:12.010 --> 03:27:13.826
TALIESIN: Is it dangerous?

5060
03:27:15.018 --> 03:27:18.400
MATT: The breeze picks up once more, but is rapidly cold,

5061
03:27:18.400 --> 03:27:19.840
not in a way that it denies it, but

5062
03:27:19.840 --> 03:27:23.757
definitely confirms that there is danger ahead.

5063
03:27:29.990 --> 03:27:34.062
TALIESIN: About a day's journey, it is dangerous,

5064
03:27:37.430 --> 03:27:39.071
but we head this way.

5065
03:27:39.071 --> 03:27:40.429
LIAM: Lead the way.

5066
03:27:41.448 --> 03:27:42.770
LAURA: Okie dokie.

5067
03:27:42.770 --> 03:27:44.830
SAM: Do you know what we're looking for?

5068
03:27:44.830 --> 03:27:46.850
A house, a hill, a grove?

5069
03:27:47.810 --> 03:27:50.225
TALIESIN: An oasis.
SAM: An oasis.

5070
03:27:52.030 --> 03:27:54.170
MARISHA: Are we walking along the beach or--

5071
03:27:54.170 --> 03:27:55.640
TALIESIN: No, we're walking into the jungle.

5072
03:27:55.640 --> 03:27:57.330
LAURA: Great.

5073
03:27:57.330 --> 03:28:01.530
MATT: You can hear the various jungle birds and wildlife

5074
03:28:01.530 --> 03:28:05.246
giving off loud caws and crows

5075
03:28:05.246 --> 03:28:08.210
and distant insects chirping.

5076
03:28:08.210 --> 03:28:11.060
It's a wild, tangled space.

5077
03:28:11.060 --> 03:28:14.348
Essek goes, "Well, that is not for me.

5078
03:28:15.640 --> 03:28:18.068
"Thank you, Jester, and good luck."

5079
03:28:20.990 --> 03:28:24.510
And glides over and lands down into a patch of sand

5080
03:28:24.510 --> 03:28:26.310
and begins to take his finger and carve out

5081
03:28:26.310 --> 03:28:28.570
a teleportation circle.

5082
03:28:28.570 --> 03:28:30.070
LIAM: Thank you, friend.
TALIESIN: Thank you.

5083
03:28:30.070 --> 03:28:31.436
MATT: "Of course."

5084
03:28:33.280 --> 03:28:35.266
Continues his work.
TRAVIS: Spit spot!

5085
03:28:35.266 --> 03:28:36.370
(laughter)

5086
03:28:36.370 --> 03:28:37.279
(gagging)

5087
03:28:37.279 --> 03:28:39.690
(laughter)

5088
03:28:39.690 --> 03:28:44.550
MATT: The jungle awaits you.
SAM: Okay, shall we?

5089
03:28:44.550 --> 03:28:45.640
TALIESIN: Thank you for this.

5090
03:28:45.640 --> 03:28:48.350
You don't teleport to a place like this,

5091
03:28:48.350 --> 03:28:51.360
you have to make it there.

5092
03:28:53.070 --> 03:28:54.570
MARISHA: Are we cheating in some way?

5093
03:28:55.840 --> 03:28:58.598
TALIESIN: This is as close as I was comfortable getting.

5094
03:29:00.250 --> 03:29:01.900
LAURA: Now we make it.
TALIESIN: Now we walk.

5095
03:29:02.830 --> 03:29:03.663
LAURA: Okay.

5096
03:29:05.030 --> 03:29:05.863
MATT: All right.

5097
03:29:09.037 --> 03:29:09.870
You guys--

5098
03:29:12.012 --> 03:29:13.036
LAURA: Oh man.

5099
03:29:13.036 --> 03:29:18.036
MATT: Begin to trek your initial steps

5100
03:29:18.036 --> 03:29:19.812
into this jungle,

5101
03:29:19.812 --> 03:29:24.610
stepping over heavy thick base roots,

5102
03:29:24.610 --> 03:29:28.500
pushing past all manner of flora and fauna,

5103
03:29:28.500 --> 03:29:31.720
heavy ferns that rise up to maybe five, six feet,

5104
03:29:31.720 --> 03:29:34.740
some even taller the further in you get.

5105
03:29:34.740 --> 03:29:36.380
The path that you trek is not a path,

5106
03:29:36.380 --> 03:29:38.500
there is no walked path in this area,

5107
03:29:38.500 --> 03:29:42.470
you're having to climb over and carve

5108
03:29:42.470 --> 03:29:46.310
probably the first steps from this point of entry

5109
03:29:46.310 --> 03:29:49.180
that have made their way from any journeyman.

5110
03:29:49.180 --> 03:29:53.200
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and let as much flora, fauna,

5111
03:29:53.200 --> 03:29:55.310
and animal life know why we're here and what we're

5112
03:29:55.310 --> 03:29:58.330
looking for and that we're just passing through,

5113
03:29:58.330 --> 03:30:00.163
heading to the oasis.

5114
03:30:00.163 --> 03:30:01.420
MATT: All right.

5115
03:30:01.420 --> 03:30:04.300
The air is very warm, which is comforting,

5116
03:30:04.300 --> 03:30:06.170
especially given the last night that you spent

5117
03:30:06.170 --> 03:30:09.330
in the chilly mountains on the

5118
03:30:09.330 --> 03:30:11.480
northern side of the Cyrios Mountain range.

5119
03:30:13.690 --> 03:30:16.780
Numerous heavy vines wrap around

5120
03:30:16.780 --> 03:30:20.090
the thick, thick tree trunks, a number of which

5121
03:30:20.090 --> 03:30:22.530
begin to wrap and cluster in front of you,

5122
03:30:22.530 --> 03:30:24.520
forming small barriers that you have to

5123
03:30:24.520 --> 03:30:27.370
hack through and push your way around.

5124
03:30:27.370 --> 03:30:31.090
You find small nests of insects and other

5125
03:30:31.090 --> 03:30:35.010
small woodland creatures built along bases and upward.

5126
03:30:35.010 --> 03:30:37.570
Some of these trees, banyan tree-type,

5127
03:30:37.570 --> 03:30:41.000
these thick, squat trees with these heavy, heavy

5128
03:30:41.000 --> 03:30:43.070
just dozens and dozens of thick branches

5129
03:30:43.070 --> 03:30:44.580
that build up into the large canopy,

5130
03:30:44.580 --> 03:30:47.070
each one knotting and tangling with the next,

5131
03:30:47.070 --> 03:30:50.270
forming this network with occasional breaks

5132
03:30:50.270 --> 03:30:53.890
where you can see the dust and pollen and other sorts of

5133
03:30:55.170 --> 03:31:00.170
various nature-based clouding material

5134
03:31:00.790 --> 03:31:04.920
that drift through and elements of light peek in beams

5135
03:31:04.920 --> 03:31:06.710
that begin to greet you as you

5136
03:31:06.710 --> 03:31:08.730
push from one barrier to the next.

5137
03:31:09.710 --> 03:31:11.600
The smell and the scent is

5138
03:31:11.600 --> 03:31:15.160
profoundly comforting, though odd.

5139
03:31:15.160 --> 03:31:20.160
It is nature in a way that is full of life.

5140
03:31:20.180 --> 03:31:22.840
It's sweet, similar to the smell that

5141
03:31:22.840 --> 03:31:24.390
came with the breeze of your Commune,

5142
03:31:24.390 --> 03:31:26.800
but more varied and diverse in the way that

5143
03:31:26.800 --> 03:31:29.570
it affects the memories that come to mind

5144
03:31:29.570 --> 03:31:32.328
that are connected to some of these smells.

5145
03:31:34.300 --> 03:31:36.610
Who's keeping watch as you progress into this?

5146
03:31:36.610 --> 03:31:39.020
What is the marching order?
LAURA: Oh jeez.

5147
03:31:39.020 --> 03:31:40.260
I'm assuming you're in front--
TALIESIN: I'm in front, I guess.

5148
03:31:40.260 --> 03:31:42.050
LIAM: Caduceus is the leader, yeah.

5149
03:31:42.050 --> 03:31:43.800
TRAVIS: I'll be behind Caduceus.

5150
03:31:44.740 --> 03:31:46.410
LAURA: I'll pull up the rear, maybe.

5151
03:31:46.410 --> 03:31:47.981
ASHLEY: I'll go behind Fjord.

5152
03:31:47.981 --> 03:31:49.500
LIAM: I'll take the center of the line if--

5153
03:31:49.500 --> 03:31:52.020
SAM: I'll go behind Yasha.
MARISHA: I'll protect Caleb and Nott.

5154
03:31:52.020 --> 03:31:53.020
MATT: Fjord, you're behind Caduceus?

5155
03:31:53.020 --> 03:31:55.710
TRAVIS: Fjord and Yasha with swords, slicing through.

5156
03:31:55.710 --> 03:31:57.250
ASHLEY: Yep.
MATT: All right, so you're,

5157
03:31:57.250 --> 03:31:58.750
so Fjord and Yasha up there, right there.

5158
03:31:58.750 --> 03:32:00.900
LIAM: How hot is it, by the way?

5159
03:32:00.900 --> 03:32:03.120
MATT: Down here, I'd say it's probably,

5160
03:32:03.120 --> 03:32:05.870
it's not terribly hot, it's mid-80s.

5161
03:32:05.870 --> 03:32:07.310
LAURA: Oof, I definitely take off my

5162
03:32:07.310 --> 03:32:08.540
overcoat--
LIAM: Coats off, for sure.

5163
03:32:08.540 --> 03:32:09.890
LAURA: Holy moly.

5164
03:32:09.890 --> 03:32:11.730
MATT: Yeah, so it's not terribly hot,

5165
03:32:12.970 --> 03:32:16.120
but given the amount of things you have on

5166
03:32:16.120 --> 03:32:18.080
and the sense of the clothing you've been

5167
03:32:18.080 --> 03:32:19.600
wearing for different climates,

5168
03:32:19.600 --> 03:32:21.450
you're immediately starting to sweat.

5169
03:32:22.382 --> 03:32:25.641
So Beauregard, you're in the middle with Caleb, you said?

5170
03:32:25.641 --> 03:32:28.812
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll be directly
behind Caleb and Nott, I think,

5171
03:32:28.812 --> 03:32:31.900
next to Jester.
MATT: Okay, there you go.

5172
03:32:31.900 --> 03:32:35.100
LIAM: Caleb's hair is getting really long, so he puts it up.

5173
03:32:35.100 --> 03:32:37.100
MATT: You got it.
LAURA: Topknot or a little

5174
03:32:37.100 --> 03:32:38.470
ponytail?
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5175
03:32:38.470 --> 03:32:42.080
Or the little half, the little halfer?

5176
03:32:42.080 --> 03:32:44.350
LAURA: No, full ponytail.
MARISHA: Full pony?

5177
03:32:44.350 --> 03:32:45.520
Mm, that's good.

5178
03:32:45.520 --> 03:32:47.003
LIAM: Rolled up sleeves.

5179
03:32:48.161 --> 03:32:48.994
MATT: All right, so.

5180
03:32:49.900 --> 03:32:52.042
TRAVIS: You just tie it in a knot?

5181
03:32:52.042 --> 03:32:55.020
MARISHA: Yeah, just have this ribbon, you just--

5182
03:32:55.020 --> 03:32:57.860
and then do a little loopy-loop.

5183
03:32:57.860 --> 03:33:00.050
Yours is getting there, actually, yeah.

5184
03:33:00.050 --> 03:33:02.340
TRAVIS: Got to put a little itty bitty--

5185
03:33:02.340 --> 03:33:06.870
MARISHA: Ah, like more two more weeks.
LIAM: Are you on your way to karate class, little boy?

5186
03:33:06.870 --> 03:33:09.304
TRAVIS: Do a ribbon on that bitch.

5187
03:33:09.304 --> 03:33:14.150
MARISHA: I pick like a piece of grass and tie it around.

5188
03:33:14.150 --> 03:33:17.862
There you go, nailed it.
TRAVIS: Fuck yeah.

5189
03:33:17.862 --> 03:33:20.954
(laughter)

5190
03:33:22.390 --> 03:33:24.410
MATT: It's getting mid-afternoon at this point.

5191
03:33:24.410 --> 03:33:26.090
With your time in Rosohna, you probably

5192
03:33:26.090 --> 03:33:28.120
are a few hours away from dusk.

5193
03:33:28.120 --> 03:33:30.557
You push for the first hour in.

5194
03:33:30.557 --> 03:33:32.620
This is going to be another traversing

5195
03:33:32.620 --> 03:33:36.380
a dangerous element of nature skill challenge.

5196
03:33:36.380 --> 03:33:39.570
Who wants to helm the first leg of this?

5197
03:33:39.570 --> 03:33:44.310
TALIESIN: I'll do it with a perception and my sense of where

5198
03:33:44.310 --> 03:33:45.700
I was being led.
MATT: You got it.

5199
03:33:45.700 --> 03:33:48.600
LIAM: Before we head out, Caleb reaches a pearl

5200
03:33:48.600 --> 03:33:51.360
way up high to Caduceus' forehead and casts

5201
03:33:51.360 --> 03:33:55.050
for a few moments and casts Fortune's Favor on you.

5202
03:33:55.050 --> 03:33:56.740
MATT: All right.
TALIESIN: So it's--

5203
03:33:56.740 --> 03:33:58.590
LIAM: One luck for the day whenever, it could be now,

5204
03:33:58.590 --> 03:34:00.190
it could be later.
TALIESIN: All right.

5205
03:34:01.730 --> 03:34:03.910
Nice, so perception, I'm going to

5206
03:34:03.910 --> 03:34:06.235
give myself a little boost as well.

5207
03:34:08.000 --> 03:34:09.600
LIAM: I'll just do a small--

5208
03:34:10.830 --> 03:34:13.610
TALIESIN: That's 21, 24.
SAM: Ooh.

5209
03:34:13.610 --> 03:34:16.074
MATT: 24, okay.
TRAVIS: Damn.

5210
03:34:16.074 --> 03:34:18.185
MATT: In helping lead the group forward,

5211
03:34:18.185 --> 03:34:20.250
you find the clearest path

5212
03:34:20.250 --> 03:34:22.750
that doesn't immediately cause you

5213
03:34:22.750 --> 03:34:25.270
to slow in your travel through.

5214
03:34:25.270 --> 03:34:27.970
The earlier parts of this jungle are dense,

5215
03:34:27.970 --> 03:34:30.720
but it's getting denser, and at least this first part

5216
03:34:30.720 --> 03:34:34.640
doesn't seem to be as dangerous as you surmised

5217
03:34:34.640 --> 03:34:36.170
the interior may have been alluded to

5218
03:34:36.170 --> 03:34:39.230
by your conversation with the Wildmother Melora.

5219
03:34:39.230 --> 03:34:41.410
It's beautiful, it's calming, and for those of you

5220
03:34:41.410 --> 03:34:44.080
who have never spent much time in tropical settings,

5221
03:34:44.080 --> 03:34:48.270
in particular you, Yasha, who, of everyone here,

5222
03:34:48.270 --> 03:34:50.080
has probably been the most removed from

5223
03:34:50.080 --> 03:34:54.590
a lot of these spaces, it is, it's gorgeous.

5224
03:34:54.590 --> 03:34:56.540
And some of the flowers, bright and vibrant,

5225
03:34:56.540 --> 03:34:59.520
you can't help but wanting to pick and keep.

5226
03:34:59.520 --> 03:35:00.353
ASHLEY: Caduceus,

5227
03:35:02.260 --> 03:35:04.600
can I pick a flower from here?

5228
03:35:04.600 --> 03:35:06.340
TALIESIN: Let me know and I'll ask permission.

5229
03:35:06.340 --> 03:35:10.330
Some of these things also do bite, you got to be careful.

5230
03:35:10.330 --> 03:35:12.872
MATT: Make a nature check for me.
TALIESIN: All right.

5231
03:35:12.872 --> 03:35:16.170
(birds tweeting)

5232
03:35:16.170 --> 03:35:19.170
I want to re-roll that, I'm using my--

5233
03:35:19.170 --> 03:35:20.890
pff, even worse.
MARISHA: So soon?

5234
03:35:20.890 --> 03:35:22.000
LAURA: Already?

5235
03:35:22.000 --> 03:35:24.830
TALIESIN: That was sad, a four.
MARISHA: What?

5236
03:35:24.830 --> 03:35:27.535
Wait, what was the other?
TALIESIN: Eight.

5237
03:35:28.430 --> 03:35:31.156
MATT: Does he get to-- look at the writing on the spell.

5238
03:35:31.156 --> 03:35:33.490
LIAM: It's like a luck point,

5239
03:35:33.490 --> 03:35:35.065
so you can roll twice and then take the higher.

5240
03:35:35.065 --> 03:35:37.772
TALIESIN: Oh, then eight.
LAURA: Oh.

5241
03:35:37.772 --> 03:35:39.355
LIAM: Ooh, hot dog.

5242
03:35:42.570 --> 03:35:46.820
MATT: Choose which to use.
TALIESIN: Eight.

5243
03:35:46.820 --> 03:35:47.653
MATT: Eight.

5244
03:35:47.653 --> 03:35:49.717
TALIESIN: I don't know which ones are--

5245
03:35:49.717 --> 03:35:51.070
MATT: You point out one flower, you think,

5246
03:35:51.070 --> 03:35:52.730
"Oh, that's brightly colored, that's probably dangerous.

5247
03:35:52.730 --> 03:35:55.748
"That one's muted, that one you can probably pick."

5248
03:35:55.748 --> 03:35:56.581
ASHLEY: Pick.

5249
03:35:56.581 --> 03:35:58.719
TALIESIN: I asked permission, of course, before we.

5250
03:35:58.719 --> 03:36:00.152
MATT: You did, it's important to ask consent.

5251
03:36:00.152 --> 03:36:01.307
TALIESIN: Yeah.

5252
03:36:01.307 --> 03:36:04.057
(birds tweeting)

5253
03:36:04.950 --> 03:36:06.290
MATT: You really don't know what you're talking about

5254
03:36:06.290 --> 03:36:07.860
in this particular instance, but luckily,

5255
03:36:07.860 --> 03:36:09.190
there wasn't a huge issue with this one,

5256
03:36:09.190 --> 03:36:10.978
so you pluck the flower without a problem.

5257
03:36:10.978 --> 03:36:11.811
TALIESIN: (aggressive hissing)

5258
03:36:11.811 --> 03:36:13.764
MATT: Yeah, you were very lucky.
TALIESIN: (scrabbling)

5259
03:36:13.764 --> 03:36:15.157
SAM: What is it--
TRAVIS: Oh god,

5260
03:36:15.157 --> 03:36:16.980
oh god!
ASHLEY: What is it?

5261
03:36:16.980 --> 03:36:18.730
MATT: It's a kind of--
TALIESIN: It was a cricket.

5262
03:36:18.730 --> 03:36:22.890
MATT: A teal color that towards the edges of the petals,

5263
03:36:22.890 --> 03:36:24.320
and it's a wide flower, it's that big,

5264
03:36:24.320 --> 03:36:28.120
the edges of the petals, it tends to go to a deep sea blue.

5265
03:36:28.120 --> 03:36:29.370
TALIESIN: It's a frog that looks like a flower.

5266
03:36:29.370 --> 03:36:30.678
MATT: It's very pretty.

5267
03:36:30.678 --> 03:36:31.740
LIAM: (coughing)

5268
03:36:31.740 --> 03:36:32.960
MATT: It does that, too.

5269
03:36:32.960 --> 03:36:35.860
But you manage to find the best path forward

5270
03:36:35.860 --> 03:36:38.980
that does not slow your progression into the jungle.

5271
03:36:38.980 --> 03:36:41.598
Who wants to helm the next leg of this?

5272
03:36:43.540 --> 03:36:45.230
TRAVIS: I will try.

5273
03:36:45.230 --> 03:36:46.830
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: All right.

5274
03:36:46.830 --> 03:36:49.538
MATT: What're you doing to help here?

5275
03:36:49.538 --> 03:36:51.847
SAM: Beep.
LIAM: Wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa.

5276
03:36:51.847 --> 03:36:52.689
(smacking)

5277
03:36:52.689 --> 03:36:54.224
TRAVIS: Ah.
MARISHA: Mosquito.

5278
03:36:54.224 --> 03:36:56.275
LIAM: No, that was just Liam.
MARISHA: Oh.

5279
03:36:56.275 --> 03:36:58.475
TRAVIS: I'll step forward and I'll say:

5280
03:36:58.475 --> 03:37:03.475
Listen, you fucking jungle, I'm a paladin of the Wildmother.

5281
03:37:03.480 --> 03:37:06.870
You're going to move or we're going to bust you wide open.

5282
03:37:06.870 --> 03:37:09.130
We'll wreck this place.

5283
03:37:09.130 --> 03:37:12.240
Don't make me fucking tell you twice.

5284
03:37:12.240 --> 03:37:13.912
Can I intimidate it?

5285
03:37:13.912 --> 03:37:15.030
(laughter)

5286
03:37:15.030 --> 03:37:16.670
MATT: Go ahead and roll intimidation.

5287
03:37:16.670 --> 03:37:17.710
LAURA: I love that you tried to

5288
03:37:17.710 --> 03:37:19.240
deceive and intimidate.
TALIESIN: This is not going to

5289
03:37:19.240 --> 03:37:21.800
go well.
MARISHA: Yes, intimidate the woods,

5290
03:37:21.800 --> 03:37:23.741
yes!
TRAVIS: 21.

5291
03:37:23.741 --> 03:37:24.574
MARISHA: Yes!

5292
03:37:25.440 --> 03:37:26.273
MATT: Okay.

5293
03:37:27.700 --> 03:37:29.850
You shout out loudly into the jungle,

5294
03:37:29.850 --> 03:37:31.020
out in front of your, just yelling.

5295
03:37:31.020 --> 03:37:33.120
You can see all these birds like (fluttering)

5296
03:37:33.120 --> 03:37:35.570
scatter from above the canopy, things start

5297
03:37:35.570 --> 03:37:37.370
rushing and running out of the space.

5298
03:37:38.535 --> 03:37:39.927
It looks pretty quiet.

5299
03:37:39.927 --> 03:37:41.930
(laughter)

5300
03:37:41.930 --> 03:37:43.470
MATT: Not bad.
LAURA: I feel intimidate it,

5301
03:37:43.470 --> 03:37:45.443
for sure
TRAVIS: It's the hairdo.

5302
03:37:45.443 --> 03:37:46.500
MATT: Yep.

5303
03:37:46.500 --> 03:37:48.770
You take a confident step forward.

5304
03:37:48.770 --> 03:37:50.802
(slamming)
TRAVIS: (yells)

5305
03:37:50.802 --> 03:37:53.149
(laughter)

5306
03:37:53.149 --> 03:37:55.880
MATT: A massive plant that was just beyond the root

5307
03:37:55.880 --> 03:37:58.850
you were standing on just devours Fjord,

5308
03:37:58.850 --> 03:38:01.525
just completely vanishes

5309
03:38:01.525 --> 03:38:05.690
inside of a large flytrap-like pod.

5310
03:38:05.690 --> 03:38:07.629
LIAM: Use your luck point!

5311
03:38:07.629 --> 03:38:09.330
(laughter)

5312
03:38:09.330 --> 03:38:11.309
SAM: Oh no.
MATT: You hear (muffled).

5313
03:38:11.309 --> 03:38:13.790
ASHLEY: I try to pull it open.
MATT: Roll a strength check.

5314
03:38:13.790 --> 03:38:16.242
ASHLEY: Okay.
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

5315
03:38:16.242 --> 03:38:17.192
TALIESIN: I'm giving you a d4--

5316
03:38:17.192 --> 03:38:18.947
MATT: Take eight points of acid damage, Fjord.

5317
03:38:18.947 --> 03:38:19.994
(groaning)

5318
03:38:19.994 --> 03:38:20.969
TALIESIN: I'm giving you a d4 on that, too..

5319
03:38:20.969 --> 03:38:23.418
ASHLEY: d4? Okay.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

5320
03:38:23.418 --> 03:38:24.650
(laughter)

5321
03:38:24.650 --> 03:38:26.952
ASHLEY: Oh, good. 18?
MATT: 18.

5322
03:38:26.952 --> 03:38:30.000
(groans) You start pulling the pod open.

5323
03:38:30.000 --> 03:38:31.780
You're in there, it's not enough to quite get him out,

5324
03:38:31.780 --> 03:38:34.160
like you don't pull him out, but the pod is open.

5325
03:38:34.160 --> 03:38:35.690
You can go ahead and attempt to escape if you'd like.

5326
03:38:35.690 --> 03:38:37.290
TRAVIS: I would like to please, yes,

5327
03:38:37.290 --> 03:38:40.950
I summon the sword and just try and--

5328
03:38:40.950 --> 03:38:42.410
MATT: I'll say it's easy enough.

5329
03:38:42.410 --> 03:38:45.050
This plant looks

5330
03:38:45.050 --> 03:38:48.150
more dangerous than it really is and between the two of you,

5331
03:38:48.150 --> 03:38:50.710
you manage to get him out and it slowly

5332
03:38:50.710 --> 03:38:52.484
like (ripping) pulls open.

5333
03:38:52.484 --> 03:38:55.138
TRAVIS: (screaming and panting)

5334
03:38:55.138 --> 03:38:57.680
LAURA: Good job, Fjord, now we know to watch out for those.

5335
03:38:57.680 --> 03:39:01.510
TRAVIS: Yeah, maybe we should be quiet, just a thought.

5336
03:39:02.590 --> 03:39:03.423
(whispered) Sorry.

5337
03:39:04.680 --> 03:39:06.467
Ah, it stings.

5338
03:39:06.467 --> 03:39:08.612
(laughter)

5339
03:39:08.612 --> 03:39:10.750
MATT: The pod is a purplish color on the outside,

5340
03:39:10.750 --> 03:39:14.230
which is very glaring, but when it's open,

5341
03:39:14.230 --> 03:39:15.830
the interior is almost perfectly

5342
03:39:15.830 --> 03:39:18.320
camouflaged with the extremely green--

5343
03:39:18.320 --> 03:39:20.310
LAURA: We need to definitely--
TALIESIN: So now we know what to

5344
03:39:20.310 --> 03:39:22.070
look for.
MATT: Yes.

5345
03:39:22.070 --> 03:39:24.300
TALIESIN: We look for ground that looks like ground.

5346
03:39:24.300 --> 03:39:26.182
TRAVIS: It looks like a big-ass mouth.

5347
03:39:26.182 --> 03:39:27.940
(coughing)

5348
03:39:27.940 --> 03:39:28.800
TALIESIN: Be careful.

5349
03:39:28.800 --> 03:39:29.883
LAURA: Smart.

5350
03:39:31.840 --> 03:39:34.664
MATT: All right, who would like to take this next leg?

5351
03:39:34.664 --> 03:39:37.423
LAURA: Um.
MARISHA: Oh boy.

5352
03:39:37.423 --> 03:39:39.967
ASHLEY: I'll take it.

5353
03:39:39.967 --> 03:39:41.800
MATT: Okay, well, what skill,

5354
03:39:41.800 --> 03:39:45.980
what are you attempting to aid this journey with and how--

5355
03:39:45.980 --> 03:39:47.140
ASHLEY: Oh, I was just going to do a survival.

5356
03:39:47.140 --> 03:39:49.020
MATT: You could do the survival, that's a way to do it.

5357
03:39:49.020 --> 03:39:50.930
ASHLEY: No, let me think if there's something better here--

5358
03:39:50.930 --> 03:39:52.190
MATT: Just explain how it pertains to--

5359
03:39:52.190 --> 03:39:53.948
TRAVIS: It's better than intimidation.

5360
03:39:53.948 --> 03:39:54.980
(laughter)

5361
03:39:54.980 --> 03:39:56.660
MATT: If you rolled high enough,

5362
03:39:56.660 --> 03:39:59.210
I was like, "I'll figure out something."

5363
03:39:59.210 --> 03:40:01.500
ASHLEY: Can I try to

5364
03:40:03.020 --> 03:40:05.140
look at the path and

5365
03:40:06.990 --> 03:40:10.165
investigate to see if there's a

5366
03:40:10.165 --> 03:40:13.080
nice, easy way through?

5367
03:40:13.080 --> 03:40:16.588
MATT: Investigation could possibly, yeah,
you could give it a shot.

5368
03:40:16.588 --> 03:40:18.288
LIAM: Slow down, Orphan Maker.

5369
03:40:18.288 --> 03:40:19.522
Puts the pearl up to her head.

5370
03:40:19.522 --> 03:40:22.270
LAURA: Beep beep beep beep beep.
TRAVIS: It lasts for a whole day?

5371
03:40:22.270 --> 03:40:23.460
MATT: Lasts for an hour.

5372
03:40:23.460 --> 03:40:25.389
TRAVIS: Hour, okay.
ASHLEY: 'Kay.

5373
03:40:28.450 --> 03:40:29.850
That means I can reroll?

5374
03:40:29.850 --> 03:40:31.200
TRAVIS: Yeah, right now.
ASHLEY: Okay.

5375
03:40:32.794 --> 03:40:33.970
Oh, it's cocked.

5376
03:40:34.920 --> 03:40:36.680
It's cocked again, I'm sorry.

5377
03:40:36.680 --> 03:40:38.480
LIAM: Throw that die in the--
ASHLEY: No, I love it,

5378
03:40:38.480 --> 03:40:40.793
though, when it rolls well.

5379
03:40:40.793 --> 03:40:42.183
TRAVIS: When it rolls well.

5380
03:40:42.183 --> 03:40:43.490
TALIESIN: It certainly wasn't the last time you rolled,

5381
03:40:43.490 --> 03:40:45.890
that was really bad.
ASHLEY: 19.

5382
03:40:45.890 --> 03:40:47.100
MATT: 19, okay.

5383
03:40:49.730 --> 03:40:53.860
You do slow the travel of the group slightly

5384
03:40:53.860 --> 03:40:55.840
because you're taking the time to be very careful.

5385
03:40:55.840 --> 03:40:58.480
This is your, while you're not used to jungle,

5386
03:40:58.480 --> 03:41:01.000
you're definitely used to dangerous marshland

5387
03:41:01.000 --> 03:41:03.900
and tangled paths through heavy vegetation,

5388
03:41:03.900 --> 03:41:05.890
though a very different kind, but there's

5389
03:41:05.890 --> 03:41:07.600
some elements that are consistent through

5390
03:41:07.600 --> 03:41:09.050
and, you know, Beau backs you up a little bit too,

5391
03:41:09.050 --> 03:41:11.980
being very keen in the eyes, but peering through,

5392
03:41:11.980 --> 03:41:14.550
you find the areas that immediately look like

5393
03:41:14.550 --> 03:41:16.270
they've been walked a little more by the wildlife,

5394
03:41:16.270 --> 03:41:17.460
which means they're the ones that are probably the most

5395
03:41:17.460 --> 03:41:21.020
successfully traversed by those that live here often.

5396
03:41:21.020 --> 03:41:23.010
And following those paths, those trails,

5397
03:41:23.010 --> 03:41:26.270
and the signs of edges of trees where you can

5398
03:41:26.270 --> 03:41:28.460
see darkening coloration from animals that have

5399
03:41:28.460 --> 03:41:30.520
brushed against it to mark their territory and such,

5400
03:41:30.520 --> 03:41:33.180
you see the familiar signs of these things and go,

5401
03:41:33.180 --> 03:41:34.610
"This is probably where we should go."

5402
03:41:35.780 --> 03:41:38.470
And you do manage to get on for another hour or so

5403
03:41:38.470 --> 03:41:41.570
without any serious issue.
LAURA: Hey!

5404
03:41:41.570 --> 03:41:44.020
MATT: It is starting to get dark.

5405
03:41:44.020 --> 03:41:46.274
LAURA: What's the ground look like here?

5406
03:41:46.274 --> 03:41:48.140
MATT: I mean, it's rough.

5407
03:41:48.140 --> 03:41:50.840
You could take a while to search for

5408
03:41:50.840 --> 03:41:54.220
a place to set up a dome comfortably,

5409
03:41:54.220 --> 03:41:55.410
that'll probably take the rest of the time

5410
03:41:55.410 --> 03:41:56.750
before the daylight closes, or you can--

5411
03:41:56.750 --> 03:41:58.870
LIAM: Caleb lights up his hand as they're walking.

5412
03:41:58.870 --> 03:41:59.813
MATT: Mmkay.

5413
03:41:59.813 --> 03:42:02.449
You'll have to probably clear an area, too, to make--

5414
03:42:02.449 --> 03:42:04.430
LAURA: Find a dome spot

5415
03:42:04.430 --> 03:42:06.470
or we travel through the night?
LIAM: There are also trees here.

5416
03:42:06.470 --> 03:42:09.578
I mean, I've heard of camping in the trees.

5417
03:42:09.578 --> 03:42:10.445
MARISHA: Actually--
LAURA: Yeah, there's probably

5418
03:42:10.445 --> 03:42:14.953
large cats and evil animals,

5419
03:42:14.953 --> 03:42:16.350
maybe, that live up there.

5420
03:42:16.350 --> 03:42:17.790
TRAVIS: What're you basing that off of?

5421
03:42:17.790 --> 03:42:19.650
LAURA: I don't know, the books I read?

5422
03:42:19.650 --> 03:42:21.520
TALIESIN: We're near the menagerie,
which means there could be

5423
03:42:21.520 --> 03:42:25.430
all sorts of strange animal life, it could be very varied.

5424
03:42:25.430 --> 03:42:26.784
MARISHA: Is there a tree nearby?

5425
03:42:26.784 --> 03:42:28.770
MATT: There are trees everywhere nearby.

5426
03:42:28.770 --> 03:42:31.350
LAURA: Surrounded by trees.
MARISHA: Tall ones?

5427
03:42:31.350 --> 03:42:32.900
MATT: They're all, I mean, from what you can tell,

5428
03:42:32.900 --> 03:42:35.050
I mean, the canopies are low for

5429
03:42:35.050 --> 03:42:37.120
the thickness of them, they're very squat jungle trees.

5430
03:42:37.120 --> 03:42:40.100
You're not quite sure how tall, you know,

5431
03:42:40.100 --> 03:42:41.410
from where you currently are, they are,

5432
03:42:41.410 --> 03:42:44.020
but some of them are probably a good 20 or so feet up.

5433
03:42:44.020 --> 03:42:47.110
MARISHA: I'm going to, if I'm nearby, judge the

5434
03:42:47.110 --> 03:42:50.160
tallest one that I have and climb it.

5435
03:42:50.160 --> 03:42:52.420
MATT: Okay, this one looks to
probably close to 30 or so feet.

5436
03:42:52.420 --> 03:42:54.660
MARISHA: All right, climb it for vantage.

5437
03:42:54.660 --> 03:42:56.660
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: I'm going to smack her butt

5438
03:42:56.660 --> 03:42:59.630
on the way up and say: Traveler loves you.

5439
03:42:59.630 --> 03:43:02.420
MARISHA: Thanks.
LAURA: You're guided.

5440
03:43:02.420 --> 03:43:04.980
MATT: You can take the athletics or acrobatics, your choice.

5441
03:43:04.980 --> 03:43:08.310
MARISHA: I will take acrobatics.

5442
03:43:08.310 --> 03:43:13.090
And do I have a, my wall run type of situation,

5443
03:43:13.090 --> 03:43:15.614
my Unarmored Movement?
MATT: Yes, you do.

5444
03:43:15.614 --> 03:43:20.280
That's right, because you can--
MARISHA: Run up vertical surfaces.

5445
03:43:20.280 --> 03:43:22.090
MATT: So you actually probably
don't even have to roll for this.

5446
03:43:22.090 --> 03:43:24.110
LIAM: Monk shit.
MATT: Fricking monks.

5447
03:43:28.204 --> 03:43:31.333
Yeah, this is part of the, ch-ch-ch, there it is.

5448
03:43:31.333 --> 03:43:33.940
(birds tweeting)

5449
03:43:33.940 --> 03:43:34.773
TALIESIN: What's up with that?

5450
03:43:34.773 --> 03:43:36.280
That's an interesting looking die you have there.

5451
03:43:36.280 --> 03:43:38.200
MARISHA: This is the goldfish.

5452
03:43:38.200 --> 03:43:39.670
TALIESIN: Oh, that's right.
ASHLEY: Oh, that's awesome.

5453
03:43:39.670 --> 03:43:40.837
MARISHA: Yeah.

5454
03:43:42.339 --> 03:43:44.050
MATT: As part of the Slow Fall element?

5455
03:43:45.050 --> 03:43:48.858
MARISHA: No, Unarmored Movement.

5456
03:43:48.858 --> 03:43:50.983
MATT: Oh, there it is, gotcha.

5457
03:43:52.450 --> 03:43:53.630
So yeah, with your current movement,

5458
03:43:53.630 --> 03:43:55.340
you could probably just, don't even have to roll,

5459
03:43:55.340 --> 03:43:57.480
you can just run up that tree.
MARISHA: Cool.

5460
03:43:57.480 --> 03:43:59.680
Thanks, Traveler! And I run up.

5461
03:43:59.680 --> 03:44:02.190
MATT: You see Beau just gets a running start and

5462
03:44:02.190 --> 03:44:04.530
(quick footsteps) and vanishes.

5463
03:44:06.015 --> 03:44:07.398
MARISHA: She thinks it's the Traveler,

5464
03:44:07.398 --> 03:44:10.198
it's just because Jester smacked her on the ass, though.

5465
03:44:10.198 --> 03:44:11.500
MATT: There you go.
MARISHA: Yeah.

5466
03:44:11.500 --> 03:44:13.900
I'm just very invigorated by <i>that</i>.

5467
03:44:13.900 --> 03:44:15.260
MATT: I respect it.

5468
03:44:16.143 --> 03:44:18.110
Okay, you head up to the top and glance over

5469
03:44:18.110 --> 03:44:21.010
and immediately, your eyes are taken by

5470
03:44:21.010 --> 03:44:23.940
the bright sunlight.
MARISHA: Oh, it's still daylight.

5471
03:44:23.940 --> 03:44:26.650
MATT: Well, it's, you're getting close, you have about

5472
03:44:26.650 --> 03:44:29.540
an hour or so before you lose all daylight,

5473
03:44:29.540 --> 03:44:30.840
it's starting to get that dusk color,

5474
03:44:30.840 --> 03:44:33.280
but it's still setting in that direction

5475
03:44:33.280 --> 03:44:35.890
and the bright orange-yellow color of it that way

5476
03:44:35.890 --> 03:44:38.267
catches you from the dark canopy that you ran up.

5477
03:44:38.267 --> 03:44:40.080
LIAM: Dark under the trees.
MATT: It's beautiful, though.

5478
03:44:40.080 --> 03:44:42.060
The view here, you can see the ocean

5479
03:44:42.060 --> 03:44:43.410
into the distance, just past the canopy,

5480
03:44:43.410 --> 03:44:46.070
and it's thick and it goes on endlessly.

5481
03:44:46.070 --> 03:44:48.060
In fact, all you can pretty much see is just green

5482
03:44:48.060 --> 03:44:50.970
and a little bit of blue on the horizon to the south.

5483
03:44:50.970 --> 03:44:53.050
And that's what catches you in the moment.

5484
03:44:54.230 --> 03:44:57.830
MARISHA: I try to, I blink my eyes to focus.

5485
03:44:57.830 --> 03:45:01.630
Any clearings nearby, any patches?

5486
03:45:01.630 --> 03:45:03.966
MATT: Make a perception check.

5487
03:45:03.966 --> 03:45:05.790
ASHLEY: Bilbo Baggins.
TALIESIN: You still have that d4.

5488
03:45:05.790 --> 03:45:06.928
MARISHA: Okay, okay--

5489
03:45:06.928 --> 03:45:09.430
I still have a d4?
LIAM: Baggins moment.

5490
03:45:09.430 --> 03:45:10.963
TRAVIS: Butterflies.
MATT: From--?

5491
03:45:10.963 --> 03:45:13.190
MARISHA: From the bless?
TALIESIN: She didn't burn it,

5492
03:45:13.190 --> 03:45:14.880
the bless just holds until you use it.

5493
03:45:14.880 --> 03:45:15.713
MATT: Oh, you used Bless?

5494
03:45:15.713 --> 03:45:16.820
LAURA: No.

5495
03:45:16.820 --> 03:45:18.100
TALIESIN: No, not Bless, it's--
LAURA: Guidance.

5496
03:45:18.100 --> 03:45:19.560
TALIESIN: Guidance just holds until you use it.

5497
03:45:19.560 --> 03:45:21.810
MATT: Guidance lasts for a round, I'll allow it

5498
03:45:21.810 --> 03:45:24.100
because you ran it pretty quick in one round, sure.

5499
03:45:24.100 --> 03:45:25.680
MARISHA: Okay, then.
MATT: I'll allow it.

5500
03:45:25.680 --> 03:45:29.190
MARISHA: That is 25.
TALIESIN: Up to a minute.

5501
03:45:29.190 --> 03:45:31.580
MATT: 25, okay.
MARISHA: Yeah, total.

5502
03:45:31.580 --> 03:45:34.832
TALIESIN: Guidance is up to a minute.
MATT: Oh, until used? Got it.

5503
03:45:36.432 --> 03:45:38.097
That's right, a minute.

5504
03:45:38.097 --> 03:45:40.200
All right, so yeah, you focus your eyes

5505
03:45:40.200 --> 03:45:42.190
for a second, glance out and you--

5506
03:45:42.190 --> 03:45:44.090
MARISHA: Doing it for Jester. (groans)

5507
03:45:44.090 --> 03:45:45.627
MATT: You think you see,

5508
03:45:49.120 --> 03:45:51.040
probably about a quarter mile off

5509
03:45:51.040 --> 03:45:54.960
in a southwestern direction,

5510
03:45:54.960 --> 03:45:58.000
an area where the canopy folds in a bit,

5511
03:45:58.000 --> 03:45:59.690
what would be a small pocket that

5512
03:45:59.690 --> 03:46:02.160
isn't completely flush with the rest of

5513
03:46:02.160 --> 03:46:04.730
the treeline within your immediate vicinity.

5514
03:46:04.730 --> 03:46:06.350
MARISHA: That is, wait, what?
LAURA: Isn't.

5515
03:46:06.350 --> 03:46:08.071
MARISHA: Isn't.
LAURA: Probably a clearing.

5516
03:46:08.071 --> 03:46:09.588
MARISHA: Okay.
MATT: The closest you can think of is--

5517
03:46:09.588 --> 03:46:14.588
MARISHA: A quarter mile west, is that what you just said?

5518
03:46:14.600 --> 03:46:16.770
MATT: Southwest of where you--
MARISHA: Southwest, okay.

5519
03:46:16.770 --> 03:46:18.230
I climb back down.

5520
03:46:18.230 --> 03:46:21.080
Quarter mile, southwest, follow me.

5521
03:46:21.080 --> 03:46:24.122
Yeah, not far, like 10 minutes.

5522
03:46:24.122 --> 03:46:25.540
All right.
LAURA: Quarter mile, yeah.

5523
03:46:25.540 --> 03:46:27.720
MARISHA: Quarter mile, yeah.
MATT: Mmkay.

5524
03:46:27.720 --> 03:46:30.300
TALIESIN: 20 minutes, 30 minutes.
MATT: Following Beau's lead--

5525
03:46:30.300 --> 03:46:32.920
MARISHA: 15 minutes.
MATT: And you guys

5526
03:46:32.920 --> 03:46:35.590
continue to carve through the jungle path.

5527
03:46:35.590 --> 03:46:38.120
You eventually come upon a small element of the clearing

5528
03:46:38.120 --> 03:46:41.190
where you can see a tree has fallen.

5529
03:46:41.190 --> 03:46:45.610
It was, you know, either it was really old or really sick.

5530
03:46:45.610 --> 03:46:47.910
It collapsed under its own weight to one side,

5531
03:46:47.910 --> 03:46:51.170
the roots tearing up on the one end and you can see

5532
03:46:51.170 --> 03:46:54.650
the inside of where the exposed roots of it are,

5533
03:46:54.650 --> 03:46:56.220
it's been hollowed out and it's probably home

5534
03:46:56.220 --> 03:46:58.970
to a number of creatures that aren't currently present.

5535
03:46:59.880 --> 03:47:02.590
But it is a clearing where you could

5536
03:47:02.590 --> 03:47:04.740
place the dome relatively comfortably there.

5537
03:47:04.740 --> 03:47:05.850
You'd have clear the floor

5538
03:47:05.850 --> 03:47:09.130
from some of the nearby ferns and other--

5539
03:47:09.130 --> 03:47:11.900
TALIESIN: Is it my imagination that
something probably lives here?

5540
03:47:11.900 --> 03:47:13.190
I want to just take a look to see

5541
03:47:13.190 --> 03:47:15.640
if it seems like something big lives inside this tree.

5542
03:47:15.640 --> 03:47:19.473
MATT: Okay, make a nature check.
TALIESIN: Oof.

5543
03:47:22.150 --> 03:47:24.830
My nature is terrible, which is part of the fun of this.

5544
03:47:27.210 --> 03:47:29.672
14.
MATT: 14's not too bad.

5545
03:47:30.590 --> 03:47:32.340
From what you can tell, elements of this

5546
03:47:32.340 --> 03:47:34.370
have been carved and hollowed out by

5547
03:47:35.410 --> 03:47:40.330
probably some sort of a rodent-type creature,

5548
03:47:40.330 --> 03:47:42.810
based on the tooth marks and the scratches,

5549
03:47:42.810 --> 03:47:45.040
probably no larger than that size

5550
03:47:45.040 --> 03:47:48.160
and probably a dozen or so have made homes within

5551
03:47:48.160 --> 03:47:49.950
the base of the tree.

5552
03:47:51.790 --> 03:47:53.270
TALIESIN: How big would I imagine

5553
03:47:53.270 --> 03:47:55.020
these creatures to be, like this big?

5554
03:47:55.020 --> 03:47:56.700
MATT: Like about as big as I just showed you,

5555
03:47:56.700 --> 03:47:58.252
yeah.
TALIESIN: Okay.

5556
03:47:59.430 --> 03:48:02.040
There's a bunch of little animals that live in this.

5557
03:48:02.040 --> 03:48:03.580
I don't know if we should camp inside,

5558
03:48:03.580 --> 03:48:04.875
I think maybe off to the side--

5559
03:48:04.875 --> 03:48:06.650
LAURA: Sprinkle, you can make some friends!

5560
03:48:06.650 --> 03:48:08.510
TALIESIN: We don't disturb them.

5561
03:48:08.510 --> 03:48:09.343
Oh.

5562
03:48:09.343 --> 03:48:10.190
LAURA: I don't think he wants to make--

5563
03:48:10.190 --> 03:48:12.540
SAM: Maybe he'll want to stay here forever.

5564
03:48:12.540 --> 03:48:14.606
LAURA: No, Nott.

5565
03:48:14.606 --> 03:48:19.400
SAM: Where he can live, can live a life of an animal.

5566
03:48:19.400 --> 03:48:21.200
TALIESIN: For, like, a day.
LAURA: Sprinkle, do you want to

5567
03:48:21.200 --> 03:48:22.243
stay with me or do you want to

5568
03:48:22.243 --> 03:48:24.993
live the life of a wild creature?

5569
03:48:27.001 --> 03:48:29.778
Should we make a hut?
LIAM: Let's make a hut.

5570
03:48:29.778 --> 03:48:32.063
MARISHA: She doesn't wait for an answer. (laughs)

5571
03:48:32.063 --> 03:48:33.363
Just make a hut.

5572
03:48:33.363 --> 03:48:34.567
(laughter)

5573
03:48:34.567 --> 03:48:36.630
MATT: Yeah, you can set up.
LIAM: Okay.

5574
03:48:36.630 --> 03:48:37.750
MATT: After clearing the space a bit

5575
03:48:37.750 --> 03:48:39.020
and by the time you get ready for it,

5576
03:48:39.020 --> 03:48:40.300
you are losing the last bit of daylight,

5577
03:48:40.300 --> 03:48:42.890
so the timing's pretty perfect, actually.

5578
03:48:42.890 --> 03:48:47.890
SAM: As Caleb is preparing,
I'll take a little sip of whiskey.

5579
03:48:47.890 --> 03:48:50.733
LAURA: No, no.
ASHLEY: I knock it out.

5580
03:48:50.733 --> 03:48:54.030
SAM: With what?

5581
03:48:54.030 --> 03:48:57.990
ASHLEY: I backhand your flask.

5582
03:48:57.990 --> 03:48:59.991
SAM: I dodge it.

5583
03:48:59.991 --> 03:49:02.967
MATT: Roll an attack roll.

5584
03:49:02.967 --> 03:49:05.487
TRAVIS: Reckless.
MATT: You can be reckless

5585
03:49:05.487 --> 03:49:07.100
if you want to.
ASHLEY: Oh, yeah,

5586
03:49:07.100 --> 03:49:08.520
yeah yeah yeah, of course.

5587
03:49:09.790 --> 03:49:11.707
Oh wait, what was that?

5588
03:49:12.630 --> 03:49:13.900
Oh yeah.

5589
03:49:15.340 --> 03:49:16.173
22.

5590
03:49:17.526 --> 03:49:20.364
SAM: I mean, that hits, yeah.
MATT: Yeah.

5591
03:49:20.364 --> 03:49:21.961
SAM: Gah!

5592
03:49:21.961 --> 03:49:24.040
MATT: (whooshing) (pinging)

5593
03:49:24.040 --> 03:49:27.342
It lands a little ways off.
ASHLEY: I pick it up.

5594
03:49:34.124 --> 03:49:36.120
You told me to do it.

5595
03:49:36.120 --> 03:49:38.470
SAM: I was just sort of kidding.
LAURA: You weren't.

5596
03:49:38.470 --> 03:49:41.340
ASHLEY: No, you weren't kidding.
TALIESIN: Not at all.

5597
03:49:41.340 --> 03:49:42.500
ASHLEY: We're keeping you accountable.

5598
03:49:42.500 --> 03:49:44.070
SAM: All right, good.
ASHLEY: We're a tribe now.

5599
03:49:44.070 --> 03:49:45.720
SAM: That was a test and you passed.

5600
03:49:47.370 --> 03:49:49.280
ASHLEY: Okay, well do you want a sip for being good?

5601
03:49:49.280 --> 03:49:50.696
SAM: Yes.

5602
03:49:50.696 --> 03:49:54.503
ASHLEY: That was a test, and you failed.

5603
03:49:54.503 --> 03:49:56.086
I put it in my bag.

5604
03:49:58.149 --> 03:50:01.110
MATT: Beautiful.
TALIESIN: I love all of this.

5605
03:50:01.110 --> 03:50:01.943
MATT: All righty.

5606
03:50:03.308 --> 03:50:06.299
You set up the dome without issue.

5607
03:50:06.299 --> 03:50:08.680
The nocturnal beasts of the night begin to

5608
03:50:08.680 --> 03:50:10.890
go about their evening hunt and you can hear

5609
03:50:10.890 --> 03:50:15.890
the distant sounds of creatures you aren't familiar with

5610
03:50:16.401 --> 03:50:18.760
(birds tweeting)

5611
03:50:18.760 --> 03:50:20.320
growling,

5612
03:50:22.210 --> 03:50:25.740
purring, making calls to each other in the distance.

5613
03:50:26.680 --> 03:50:28.258
It's unsettling but you feel comfortable here--

5614
03:50:28.258 --> 03:50:29.910
LAURA: Making calls to each other in the distance.

5615
03:50:29.910 --> 03:50:31.524
Hello?!

5616
03:50:31.524 --> 03:50:33.960
MATT: I'm just real curious how your night's been over there

5617
03:50:33.960 --> 03:50:36.947
because it's real heavy over where I live.

5618
03:50:36.947 --> 03:50:38.942
LAURA: Do you hear all these bugs?

5619
03:50:38.942 --> 03:50:40.686
(laughter)

5620
03:50:40.686 --> 03:50:41.539
ASHLEY: Mom?

5621
03:50:41.539 --> 03:50:43.110
(laughter)

5622
03:50:43.110 --> 03:50:45.399
MATT: But who's taking first watch?

5623
03:50:45.399 --> 03:50:46.340
If you're taking any watches or if

5624
03:50:46.340 --> 03:50:47.340
you guys just all going to sleep.

5625
03:50:47.340 --> 03:50:48.570
You feel pretty comfortable, but it's up to you.

5626
03:50:48.570 --> 03:50:50.480
LAURA: I'm going to stay up for just a little bit

5627
03:50:50.480 --> 03:50:52.710
and I'm going to draw, I'm going to take out

5628
03:50:52.710 --> 03:50:54.820
Molly's tarot deck.
MATT: Mmkay.

5629
03:50:54.820 --> 03:50:56.820
LAURA: And I'm going to draw on one of the cards.

5630
03:50:56.820 --> 03:50:59.720
I've thought of one of the cards that I want to make.

5631
03:50:59.720 --> 03:51:00.770
SAM: Ooh.
MATT: Okay.

5632
03:51:00.770 --> 03:51:02.920
SAM: What is it?
LAURA: On one,

5633
03:51:02.920 --> 03:51:05.870
so you know that optical illusion where one side looks like

5634
03:51:05.870 --> 03:51:07.410
a old lady and you flip it and it's like

5635
03:51:07.410 --> 03:51:09.180
a pretty woman?
SAM: Uh-huh.

5636
03:51:09.180 --> 03:51:10.380
LAURA: You know what I'm talking about?
SAM: Yeah, yeah.

5637
03:51:10.380 --> 03:51:11.580
LAURA: I'm going to make a dual card

5638
03:51:11.580 --> 03:51:13.463
and one side's going to be the hag

5639
03:51:13.463 --> 03:51:16.040
and then when you flip it over, it's the maiden.

5640
03:51:16.040 --> 03:51:17.070
TALIESIN: Ooh.

5641
03:51:17.070 --> 03:51:20.110
Hot.
SAM: And so that card's

5642
03:51:20.110 --> 03:51:22.470
called The Hag and Maiden?
LAURA: The Hag and the Maiden.

5643
03:51:22.470 --> 03:51:24.030
TALIESIN: They each have two names.
MARISHA: Does the maid look like you?

5644
03:51:24.030 --> 03:51:26.071
ASHLEY: That's very cool.
LAURA: Maybe.

5645
03:51:26.071 --> 03:51:28.180
(laughter)

5646
03:51:28.180 --> 03:51:31.971
She may be like a little blue color in the folds.

5647
03:51:31.971 --> 03:51:34.840
MARISHA: That's good, that's good.
MATT: All right.

5648
03:51:34.840 --> 03:51:37.010
LIAM: I have a quick thing I want to do before bed as well.

5649
03:51:37.010 --> 03:51:38.890
I'm not taking a watch, or maybe I will,

5650
03:51:38.890 --> 03:51:42.550
but I get out the ingredients I need to cast Find Familiar

5651
03:51:42.550 --> 03:51:45.982
and I place my raven cat down in the center

5652
03:51:45.982 --> 03:51:48.790
and mutter a few words and spend the time on it.

5653
03:51:48.790 --> 03:51:50.630
Oh, it takes an hour--
MATT: It takes an hour.

5654
03:51:50.630 --> 03:51:52.010
LIAM: And 10 minutes.

5655
03:51:52.010 --> 03:51:56.360
And suddenly I have a small capuchin monkey.

5656
03:51:56.360 --> 03:51:57.800
MATT: Okay.

5657
03:51:57.800 --> 03:51:59.919
LIAM: Little speckled spots all over him.

5658
03:51:59.919 --> 03:52:01.210
MATT: All righty.

5659
03:52:01.210 --> 03:52:04.187
TRAVIS: Slick, slick slick slick.

5660
03:52:04.187 --> 03:52:06.977
You see Sprinkle try to escape the dome.

5661
03:52:06.977 --> 03:52:09.202
(as Sprinkle) I volunteer as tribute.

5662
03:52:09.202 --> 03:52:11.151
MARISHA: (scrabbling)

5663
03:52:11.151 --> 03:52:14.059
LIAM: It does not have the passcode to come back in, so.

5664
03:52:14.059 --> 03:52:15.287
(laughter)

5665
03:52:15.287 --> 03:52:19.010
LAURA: Sprinkle is curled up, comfortable, in my hood,

5666
03:52:19.010 --> 03:52:21.960
a little unnerved by all of the crazy noises.

5667
03:52:21.960 --> 03:52:24.113
SAM: A little unnerved.
MARISHA: Yeah.

5668
03:52:24.113 --> 03:52:25.294
(laughter)

5669
03:52:25.294 --> 03:52:26.864
MARISHA: New development.
MATT: So,

5670
03:52:26.864 --> 03:52:29.690
you finish summoning your monkey and go to bed.

5671
03:52:29.690 --> 03:52:31.050
You're finishing the card--

5672
03:52:31.050 --> 03:52:33.164
LIAM: Summoning the monkey all night long.
MATT: Yep.

5673
03:52:33.164 --> 03:52:35.414
(laughter)

5674
03:52:37.432 --> 03:52:40.240
(laughter)

5675
03:52:40.240 --> 03:52:41.073
TRAVIS: Wizard shit.

5676
03:52:41.073 --> 03:52:43.135
MATT: Every wizard's early days at school,

5677
03:52:43.135 --> 03:52:44.193
(laughter)

5678
03:52:44.193 --> 03:52:46.127
spend a little too much time summoning the monkey.

5679
03:52:46.127 --> 03:52:47.718
(laughter)

5680
03:52:47.718 --> 03:52:48.551
All right.

5681
03:52:50.340 --> 03:52:51.940
But Jester, you're taking the first watch?

5682
03:52:51.940 --> 03:52:53.623
LAURA: Mm, mm-hmm.

5683
03:52:53.623 --> 03:52:57.157
Mm-hmm.
MATT: Okay.

5684
03:52:57.157 --> 03:52:58.420
TRAVIS: (whistling)

5685
03:52:58.420 --> 03:52:59.570
MATT: Everyone else is asleep--

5686
03:53:00.452 --> 03:53:02.020
TRAVIS: (whistling)

5687
03:53:02.020 --> 03:53:05.440
MATT: -- for the early portion of the night.

5688
03:53:09.520 --> 03:53:12.601
In that time that you're finishing your card drawing

5689
03:53:12.601 --> 03:53:14.657
and getting excited,

5690
03:53:17.901 --> 03:53:20.151
you can't help but

5691
03:53:20.151 --> 03:53:22.193
catch something in the corner of your eye

5692
03:53:23.610 --> 03:53:27.840
and outside of the dome, beyond the edge of the glade,

5693
03:53:29.540 --> 03:53:32.422
you see a familiar green robe.

5694
03:53:43.637 --> 03:53:45.450
LAURA: I get up and go.
MATT: Okay.

5695
03:53:47.766 --> 03:53:49.220
MARISHA: This is bad, right?

5696
03:53:49.220 --> 03:53:50.053
No?
SAM: I think it's fine.

5697
03:53:50.053 --> 03:53:50.910
No, it's fine.

5698
03:53:50.910 --> 03:53:52.797
They're just going to go fuck in the woods.

5699
03:53:52.797 --> 03:53:57.070
MATT: You step out of the dome and quietly make your way

5700
03:53:57.070 --> 03:53:59.480
beyond the clearing where--
LAURA: What're you doing?

5701
03:53:59.480 --> 03:54:00.880
MATT: The Traveler waits as he--

5702
03:54:02.378 --> 03:54:03.211
"Come with me.

5703
03:54:04.970 --> 03:54:08.930
"You've always been so quick to learn, so very clever.

5704
03:54:10.390 --> 03:54:11.752
"I grow so proud.

5705
03:54:12.921 --> 03:54:14.287
"I think it's time."

5706
03:54:14.287 --> 03:54:15.628
LAURA: Time for what?

5707
03:54:16.820 --> 03:54:20.153
MATT: "Do you trust me?"

5708
03:54:20.153 --> 03:54:22.128
LAURA: With everything in my being.

5709
03:54:23.872 --> 03:54:24.829
MATT: "Come."

5710
03:54:24.829 --> 03:54:27.039
He turns and walks further into

5711
03:54:27.039 --> 03:54:29.620
the darkness of the jungle, a faint green glow

5712
03:54:29.620 --> 03:54:33.590
lighting up the space around him as he walks.

5713
03:54:33.590 --> 03:54:37.439
LAURA: I glance back at the dome, (sighs)

5714
03:54:37.439 --> 03:54:39.972
and take off after the Traveler.
MATT: Okay.

5715
03:54:41.740 --> 03:54:44.150
As he walks, you can see out of

5716
03:54:44.150 --> 03:54:46.350
the corner of the green light,

5717
03:54:46.350 --> 03:54:51.350
the vines expanding and growing more vibrant

5718
03:54:52.100 --> 03:54:56.910
around him, flowers (poofing).

5719
03:54:58.590 --> 03:55:00.750
As he steps to an area and

5720
03:55:00.750 --> 03:55:02.460
puts his hand to one side, you can see

5721
03:55:02.460 --> 03:55:05.960
one of the trees very quietly

5722
03:55:05.960 --> 03:55:08.580
bends and moves aside

5723
03:55:08.580 --> 03:55:13.580
where a little corner of the jungle is serene

5724
03:55:13.860 --> 03:55:17.160
and removed from the dense expanse

5725
03:55:17.160 --> 03:55:20.580
around you.
LAURA: Wow.

5726
03:55:20.580 --> 03:55:21.900
Is this the oasis?

5727
03:55:22.900 --> 03:55:26.150
No, this is your oasis.

5728
03:55:26.150 --> 03:55:27.558
MATT: "It's a place to talk."

5729
03:55:32.530 --> 03:55:34.120
He stands and turns facing you.

5730
03:55:38.370 --> 03:55:39.851
And he pulls his hood back--

5731
03:55:39.851 --> 03:55:41.560
LAURA: (gasping)

5732
03:55:41.560 --> 03:55:44.950
MATT: -- revealing his almost elf-like features,

5733
03:55:44.950 --> 03:55:49.150
but more exaggerated and fey, his long ears

5734
03:55:49.150 --> 03:55:54.150
curling behind the head, beyond any elf's that you've seen,

5735
03:55:54.520 --> 03:55:58.200
his almond-shaped eyes of emerald green and brilliant

5736
03:55:58.200 --> 03:56:00.870
beneath these thin feather-like brows.

5737
03:56:01.910 --> 03:56:05.580
A voluminous orange-red hair curls down the back of

5738
03:56:05.580 --> 03:56:08.930
the head like a lion's mane and he smiles.

5739
03:56:11.750 --> 03:56:15.840
"Jester, you are my first disciple,

5740
03:56:17.630 --> 03:56:19.430
"the first one to truly carve the world

5741
03:56:19.430 --> 03:56:23.190
"with your cunning, your joy, and your mischief.

5742
03:56:25.590 --> 03:56:26.423
"I trust you.

5743
03:56:27.730 --> 03:56:29.780
"And are you ready for the absolute truth?"

5744
03:56:33.310 --> 03:56:34.143
LAURA: Yes?

5745
03:56:35.800 --> 03:56:40.787
MATT: "I am the Traveler, but it was not always this way,

5746
03:56:42.550 --> 03:56:46.140
"for when I traveled here, it was a world before me

5747
03:56:47.080 --> 03:56:49.310
"where I was without burdens,

5748
03:56:49.310 --> 03:56:53.220
"without responsibilities, and without limitations.

5749
03:56:55.110 --> 03:56:56.610
"I drank deep of the muted colors

5750
03:56:56.610 --> 03:57:00.150
"of Exandria, straining to exit.

5751
03:57:01.900 --> 03:57:04.530
"I plucked at and knotted the lives of many fools

5752
03:57:04.530 --> 03:57:07.490
"from the shadows, amusing myself by

5753
03:57:07.490 --> 03:57:09.790
"leaping into every whim with glee and purpose.

5754
03:57:11.630 --> 03:57:16.257
"And one day, I met a little girl
who sought that same spark,

5755
03:57:18.270 --> 03:57:20.420
"a little girl who found joy in exposing life's

5756
03:57:20.420 --> 03:57:24.340
"most subtle hypocrisies, a little blue girl

5757
03:57:24.340 --> 03:57:27.260
"who lived a life so small but felt in her heart

5758
03:57:27.260 --> 03:57:29.560
"there was so much more to see.

5759
03:57:31.860 --> 03:57:33.760
"This little girl and I found a kinship

5760
03:57:35.060 --> 03:57:39.250
"and in her child-like wonder, her view so untempered by

5761
03:57:39.250 --> 03:57:42.950
"the sanctimonious morality of man,

5762
03:57:42.950 --> 03:57:46.010
"and she saw me as a god.

5763
03:57:46.010 --> 03:57:51.010
"So for her-- for you-- I donned the mask of one.

5764
03:57:56.020 --> 03:57:59.060
"I found that with such pure, absolute faith

5765
03:57:59.060 --> 03:58:02.770
"granted towards me, I was exhilarated.

5766
03:58:02.770 --> 03:58:05.310
"I began to seek others who might be

5767
03:58:05.310 --> 03:58:08.310
"waiting for such guidance, to bring a bit of,

5768
03:58:09.670 --> 03:58:12.090
"well, necessary chaos into the world.

5769
03:58:13.860 --> 03:58:16.240
"One by one, I traveled and found

5770
03:58:16.240 --> 03:58:18.410
"more souls who needed direction,

5771
03:58:18.410 --> 03:58:23.330
"who found themselves in our shenanigans.

5772
03:58:23.330 --> 03:58:24.747
"It was beautiful.

5773
03:58:26.000 --> 03:58:29.150
"Eons of living for only myself, I found a new joy

5774
03:58:29.150 --> 03:58:31.490
"in helping others find themselves in a world

5775
03:58:31.490 --> 03:58:35.450
"cruel and painted in dull, divided pigments.

5776
03:58:36.730 --> 03:58:39.207
"With each new faith, I could find myself,

5777
03:58:40.420 --> 03:58:44.420
"I could feel myself becoming what you believed.

5778
03:58:48.160 --> 03:58:49.401
"Then more came.

5779
03:58:50.720 --> 03:58:53.840
"Playful pranks turned into demands,

"prayers fighting for my attention.

"Freshly freed from previously imposed boundaries,

5782
03:58:59.680 --> 03:59:02.364
"I had managed to really construct my own.

03:59:02.364 --> 03:59:03.740
"While such faith granted me power

03:59:03.740 --> 03:59:07.300
"beyond what I thought possible to achieve,

"I was being spread too thin across

"those who I'd taken under my wing.

03:59:12.380 --> 03:59:14.610
"I thought to bring them all together,

03:59:14.610 --> 03:59:17.580

5793
03:59:34.872 --> 03:59:36.210
LAURA: (gasping)

5794
03:59:36.210 --> 03:59:37.760
MATT: "-- and I need your help."

5795
03:59:39.140 --> 03:59:40.558
That's where it ends tonight's episode.

5796
03:59:40.558 --> 03:59:42.126
(yelling)

5797
03:59:42.126 --> 03:59:44.253
(clapping)

5798
03:59:44.253 --> 03:59:45.627
LAURA: Holy shit. (laughs)

5799
03:59:45.627 --> 03:59:47.769
TALIESIN: Just sitting here going, "Fuck off, David Bowie!

5800
03:59:47.769 --> 03:59:50.026
"Fuck off, no one wants you here, David Bowie."

5801
03:59:50.026 --> 03:59:51.035
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

5802
03:59:51.035 --> 03:59:52.530
TALIESIN: Go back to your home, David Bowie.

5803
03:59:52.530 --> 03:59:56.940
LAURA: It's a cult!
MARISHA: It is a cult.

5804
03:59:56.940 --> 04:00:00.784
This was Jester's fault the whole time.

5805
04:00:02.140 --> 04:00:04.220
SAM: Maybe not a cult--
MARISHA: Yes.

5806
04:00:04.220 --> 04:00:05.360
TALIESIN: It's a cult!
LAURA: No,

5807
04:00:05.360 --> 04:00:06.880
now he's going to be a god, he is a god.

5808
04:00:06.880 --> 04:00:08.940
TALIESIN: There's paper pants, it's a cult.

5809
04:00:08.940 --> 04:00:11.362
TRAVIS: Elven futures--
LAURA: It's Artagan!

5810
04:00:11.362 --> 04:00:14.190
It's Artagan.
MARISHA: Totally Artagan.

5811
04:00:14.190 --> 04:00:16.420
ASHLEY: Come on. You're saying yes?

5812
04:00:16.420 --> 04:00:18.060
LAURA and ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5813
04:00:18.060 --> 04:00:20.310
ASHLEY: Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.

5814
04:00:21.340 --> 04:00:23.890
LAURA: Holy shit--
SAM: Maybe it's not a cult.

5815
04:00:23.890 --> 04:00:26.150
TALIESIN: David Bowie, just David Bowie.

5816
04:00:26.150 --> 04:00:28.860
TRAVIS: "I have no idea what I'm doing"?!

5817
04:00:30.200 --> 04:00:31.380
ASHLEY: Oh no.

5818
04:00:32.220 --> 04:00:33.880
TALIESIN: Honestly, if I were ever to meet a god

5819
04:00:33.880 --> 04:00:35.020
and they said that to me, I'd be like,

5820
04:00:35.020 --> 04:00:36.887
"Okay, and now I believe that you are."

5821
04:00:36.887 --> 04:00:37.867
(laughter)

5822
04:00:37.867 --> 04:00:40.430
(clapping)

5823
04:00:40.430 --> 04:00:41.750
This got way out of hand.

5824
04:00:43.120 --> 04:00:47.078
LIAM: Traveler Con is just Artagan strangling 500 people.

5825
04:00:47.078 --> 04:00:48.140
MATT: (laughs) I mean--

5826
04:00:48.140 --> 04:00:50.800
TRAVIS: Wait, Garmelie, Artágan, Ártagan?

5827
04:00:50.800 --> 04:00:52.662
Ártagan or Artágan?

5828
04:00:52.662 --> 04:00:53.600
MATT: Artágan.
MARISHA: Garmelie,

5829
04:00:53.600 --> 04:00:55.981
and then it was like, "My name is actually Artagan."

5830
04:00:55.981 --> 04:00:57.926
TRAVIS: Garmelie was, like, the faun?

5831
04:00:57.926 --> 04:01:00.100
LAURA: Yeah yeah yeah yeah.
TALIESIN: Oh my god, oh.

5832
04:01:00.100 --> 04:01:01.220
ASHLEY: Holy.
TALIESIN: So much--

5833
04:01:01.220 --> 04:01:02.850
MATT: For so long, just--
SAM: Garmelie was the faun.

5834
04:01:02.850 --> 04:01:04.140
Was that an illusion for us?

5835
04:01:04.140 --> 04:01:06.080
LAURA: Yeah yeah yeah, it was like his changed shape.

5836
04:01:06.080 --> 04:01:07.110
MATT: Yep.
TRAVIS: Little trickster faun.

5837
04:01:07.110 --> 04:01:09.060
SAM: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Oh fuck.

5838
04:01:09.060 --> 04:01:11.470
LAURA: You did this, I'm so excited.

5839
04:01:11.470 --> 04:01:12.831
MARISHA: You did this.

5840
04:01:12.831 --> 04:01:13.914
TALIESIN: You did this!

5841
04:01:13.914 --> 04:01:16.300
MARISHA: (laughs) It's so funny.

5842
04:01:16.300 --> 04:01:18.530
SAM: It doesn't necessarily need to be a bad thing.

5843
04:01:18.530 --> 04:01:20.720
LAURA: No, it's not, it's super awesome.

5844
04:01:20.720 --> 04:01:22.470
TALIESIN: It's a clusterfuck.

5845
04:01:22.470 --> 04:01:24.380
MATT: It's a complicated thing, is what it is.

5846
04:01:24.380 --> 04:01:26.220
SAM: It's a club that you've started.

5847
04:01:26.220 --> 04:01:28.680
You started a club.
ASHLEY: You did.

5848
04:01:28.680 --> 04:01:30.840
You started a club, maybe you become, maybe--

5849
04:01:30.840 --> 04:01:32.100
TRAVIS: Married to somebody and then found

5850
04:01:32.100 --> 04:01:34.124
the secret door to their basement.

5851
04:01:34.124 --> 04:01:36.328
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

5852
04:01:36.328 --> 04:01:37.923
No.

5853
04:01:37.923 --> 04:01:39.564
It's so much more.

5854
04:01:39.564 --> 04:01:42.500
TRAVIS: No, this is fine.
TALIESIN: It's so amazing.

5855
04:01:42.500 --> 04:01:45.407
LAURA: It's totally okay. It's going to be great.

5856
04:01:45.407 --> 04:01:47.680
MATT: It was the trigger of your trickery last session

5857
04:01:47.680 --> 04:01:50.507
that he was like, "Okay, maybe she can help me."

5858
04:01:50.507 --> 04:01:52.510
(laughter)

5859
04:01:52.510 --> 04:01:54.570
LAURA: Oh my god.
MARISHA: Holy fuck.

5860
04:01:54.570 --> 04:01:56.320
LIAM: I love it.

5861
04:01:56.320 --> 04:01:58.170
LAURA: I love it so much.

5862
04:01:58.170 --> 04:02:01.360
TALIESIN: Oh my god.
MATT: It's gon' be interesting.

5863
04:02:01.360 --> 04:02:04.513
But we'll pick that up next week on Thursday.

5864
04:02:07.070 --> 04:02:08.780
Thank you for joining us.

5865
04:02:08.780 --> 04:02:12.360
Look forward to seeing you guys next Thursday

5866
04:02:12.360 --> 04:02:15.060
and hopefully those stick around on Friday, Valentine's Day,

5867
04:02:15.060 --> 04:02:18.140
to check out our Monsterhearts 2 one-shot.

5868
04:02:18.140 --> 04:02:20.690
But until then, have a wonderful night,

5869
04:02:20.690 --> 04:02:23.850

Good night.

00:00:00.128 --> 00:00:00.961
MATT: Hello everyone,

00:00:00.961 --> 00:00:02.503
and welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role,

00:00:02.503 --> 00:00:04.216
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around

00:00:04.216 --> 00:00:05.673
and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:05.673 --> 00:00:08.662
ALL: (discordant yelling) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:08.662 --> 00:00:09.985
MATT: Aw.

00:00:09.985 --> 00:00:11.880
Before we get into tonight's session,

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.724
we do have some announcements to get through

00:00:13.724 --> 00:00:17.235
beginning with our first of a few sponsors, Cortex.

00:00:17.235 --> 00:00:18.290
Sam, if you don't mind.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.438
SAM: What's crackin', young bloods and foxy mamas?

00:00:21.438 --> 00:00:22.403
LIAM: Oh no.

00:00:22.403 --> 00:00:26.679
SAM: This week's episode is sponsored by Fandom Tabletop.

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:28.117
Wait, is that right?

00:00:28.117 --> 00:00:29.569
Yes, yes!

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:34.558
You said Cortex, but it says here Fandom Tabletop,

00:00:34.558 --> 00:00:37.960
and their just-announced tabletop RPG, Tales of Xadia.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.104
This is all correct, this is all correct, I think.

00:00:41.104 --> 00:00:43.954
Based on the animated series, The Dragon Prince,

00:00:43.954 --> 00:00:47.336
the new immersive TTRPG captures the show's universe,

00:00:47.336 --> 00:00:50.337
allows you to become part of the unfolding story

00:00:50.337 --> 00:00:51.170
in the show's narrative,

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.086
and includes never before seen content

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:55.229
and lore from the world.

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:56.853
Can you dig it?

00:00:56.853 --> 00:00:59.183
With the Cortex system--
MATT: That's where

00:00:59.183 --> 00:01:01.597
I read it wrong, that's on me and the paper

00:01:01.597 --> 00:01:02.843
that put Cortex first.
SAM: No, no, no.

00:01:02.843 --> 00:01:04.252
MATT: My apologies.
SAM: We're okay.

00:01:04.252 --> 00:01:06.777
With the Cortex system leading the adventure,

00:01:06.777 --> 00:01:08.452
you'll have easy digital tools

00:01:08.452 --> 00:01:10.137
to keep the fun front and center

00:01:10.137 --> 00:01:12.614
so players aren't digging through rule books.

00:01:12.614 --> 00:01:14.032
Good vibes.

00:01:14.032 --> 00:01:16.386
Check out the free play test materials

00:01:16.386 --> 00:01:21.386
at bit.ly/crxadia

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.608
and fans who pre-order the physical

00:01:23.608 --> 00:01:27.274
get the digital copy as well.
MATT: (laughs)

00:01:27.274 --> 00:01:28.107
SAM: Now, as always,

00:01:28.107 --> 00:01:31.678
I've used Cortex to make a brand new RPG system

00:01:31.678 --> 00:01:33.862
to pitch to our crew here tonight.

00:01:33.862 --> 00:01:34.695
I call it

00:01:36.302 --> 00:01:39.610
Cyberpunk 1977.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.525
MATT: (laughs)

00:01:41.525 --> 00:01:45.618
SAM: Mooching off the unparalleled success
of Cyberpunk 2077,

00:01:45.618 --> 00:01:47.809
a cherished video game that left everyone

00:01:47.809 --> 00:01:49.660
completely satisfied--

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.728
(laughter)

00:01:51.728 --> 00:01:54.112
I wrote an unofficial prequel.

00:01:54.112 --> 00:01:56.403
It's one year post-bicentennial.

00:01:56.403 --> 00:02:00.673
America is at a crossroads, a cyber crossroads.

00:02:00.673 --> 00:02:04.453
You play as P, a cyber mercenary in the futuristic streets

00:02:04.453 --> 00:02:06.373
of the Carter administration.

00:02:06.373 --> 00:02:09.109
(laughter)

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:11.811
Customize your character with add-ons like flare jeans,

00:02:11.811 --> 00:02:14.826
mood rings, platform shoes, and chest hair.

00:02:14.826 --> 00:02:18.552
Upgrade abilities with high-tech items like a digital watch,

00:02:18.552 --> 00:02:20.427
a TRS-80,

00:02:20.427 --> 00:02:22.735
and a super rare dot matrix printer.

00:02:22.735 --> 00:02:24.201
Copacetic.

00:02:24.201 --> 00:02:25.995
I'll show you some gameplay.

00:02:25.995 --> 00:02:29.714
Okay, first, I'm going to fire up my fab threads.

00:02:29.714 --> 00:02:31.625
(laughter)

00:02:31.625 --> 00:02:32.458
Okay.

00:02:32.458 --> 00:02:36.126
Yeah, looking dolled up like Alan Alda,

00:02:36.126 --> 00:02:40.256
and I'll fill up my Ford Pinto. Roll for regular leaded.

00:02:40.256 --> 00:02:44.622
Aw man, gas shortage, 65 cents a gallon?

00:02:44.622 --> 00:02:45.549
So pricey.

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:46.723
No problem.

00:02:46.723 --> 00:02:51.017
I have a brand new two-dollar bill in my inventory

00:02:51.017 --> 00:02:52.492
just printed last year.

00:02:52.492 --> 00:02:57.079
Nice, now I'm as fast as that brand new airplane,

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:59.946
the Concorde.
(laughter)

00:02:59.946 --> 00:03:00.779
TRAVIS: Oh, man.

00:03:01.645 --> 00:03:03.593
SAM: All right, now I'm at the bad guy's hide out.

00:03:03.593 --> 00:03:05.386
I need to copy their secret plans.

00:03:05.386 --> 00:03:07.230
Roll for data.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.251
20 megabytes, whew, that'll take 14 floppy disks.

00:03:11.251 --> 00:03:12.306
No problem.

00:03:12.306 --> 00:03:13.139
Copy one.

00:03:16.122 --> 00:03:17.447
That's one.

00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:18.484
Copy two.

00:03:18.484 --> 00:03:21.170
TRAVIS: Oh, jesus.
LAURA: Please stop.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.173
SAM: You know what?

00:03:22.173 --> 00:03:24.272
Let's call it there.

00:03:24.272 --> 00:03:28.085
Check out bit.ly/crxadia and thanks to Fandom Tabletop

00:03:28.085 --> 00:03:30.799
and Cortex, and Tales of Xadia

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:32.671
for continuing support of the show.

00:03:32.671 --> 00:03:35.365
Peace, love, and granola.

00:03:35.365 --> 00:03:36.683
ASHLEY: Woo.
LAURA: Wow, yeah.

00:03:36.683 --> 00:03:39.683
MATT: Yeah, show off that keyhole, yeah.

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:43.028
TRAVIS: Breathe deep, breathe deep.
ASHLEY: What's a cool guy.

00:03:43.028 --> 00:03:44.419
MATT: No, bring it back, bring it back.

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:45.600
Don't. That's too much.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:46.433
That's too much.

00:03:46.433 --> 00:03:47.925
LIAM: Are we okay?

00:03:47.925 --> 00:03:51.726
MATT: Thank you, Tales of Xadia of the Cortex system.

00:03:51.726 --> 00:03:53.215
TRAVIS: Where did that even come from, man?

00:03:53.215 --> 00:03:56.065
LAURA: I feel like you're
still messed up from the last game.

00:03:56.065 --> 00:03:58.574
MATT: Yeah.
(laughter)

00:03:58.574 --> 00:04:00.035
ASHLEY: This looks like a piece of gum.

00:04:00.035 --> 00:04:04.377
(laughter)

00:04:05.618 --> 00:04:08.935
MATT: All righty, so to our second sponsor for tonight,

00:04:08.935 --> 00:04:10.771
our friends at Hit Point Press

00:04:10.771 --> 00:04:13.414
and their new book Hexbound.

00:04:13.414 --> 00:04:16.272
Now, this is by the same folks who did Humblewood,

00:04:16.272 --> 00:04:17.580
which you remember us talking about a while back,

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.929
as well as Antonio Demico, the creator Dragon Stew.

00:04:20.929 --> 00:04:24.034
It is a witchy supplement for 5th edition that has launched.

00:04:24.034 --> 00:04:26.248
They just launched their funding campaign for it.

00:04:26.248 --> 00:04:28.365
You can enhance your characters with the new subclasses

00:04:28.365 --> 00:04:29.979
that allow you to make the incredibly diverse array

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:32.215
of witches that can sling spells, brew potions,

00:04:32.215 --> 00:04:34.776
and even punch spirits into the bodies of their enemies

00:04:34.776 --> 00:04:35.646
which is exciting.

00:04:35.646 --> 00:04:36.962
LAURA: Ooh!
MARISHA: Punch ghosts.

00:04:36.962 --> 00:04:38.644
MATT: Hexbound also has an exciting new adventure

00:04:38.644 --> 00:04:41.468
for you to run from your classic dungeon crawls

00:04:41.468 --> 00:04:43.154
to a murder mystery set in Magical Circus,

00:04:43.154 --> 00:04:44.296
and much, much more.

00:04:44.296 --> 00:04:46.309
So many other things in this book

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:47.142
has never been seen before.

00:04:47.142 --> 00:04:49.333
Maps, creatures, and magical items as well.

00:04:49.333 --> 00:04:52.453
So check out everything now at hexbound.com,

00:04:52.453 --> 00:04:54.575
and thank you for supporting the show.

00:04:54.575 --> 00:04:57.007
And last but not least, a shout out to our friends

00:04:57.007 --> 00:04:59.298
at D&amp;D Beyond.
TRAVIS: ♪ D&amp;D Beyond ♪

00:04:59.298 --> 00:05:02.214
The official digital toolset for 5th edition D&amp;D.

00:05:02.214 --> 00:05:04.533
You can create all sorts of homebrew content

00:05:04.533 --> 00:05:05.713
and share it with your players

00:05:05.713 --> 00:05:07.354
that are part of your campaign on there.

00:05:07.354 --> 00:05:08.609
It's awesome.

00:05:08.609 --> 00:05:10.724
We've been using it for the entirety of this campaign.

00:05:10.724 --> 00:05:12.544
So go to D&amp;D Beyond and check it out,

00:05:12.544 --> 00:05:14.863
and thank you so much for the support.

00:05:14.863 --> 00:05:17.528
We have some other announcements to get to.

00:05:17.528 --> 00:05:19.480
First off, thank you all for joining us on Twitch

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.904
and on YouTube.

00:05:20.904 --> 00:05:23.864
We're streaming live as well now, if you hadn't heard.

00:05:23.864 --> 00:05:27.902
However, to join our live and moderated community
here at Twitch for the chat,

00:05:27.902 --> 00:05:30.310
please head over to our Twitch channel.

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.125
Vox Machina: Origins, series three, issue one is out now!

00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:36.376
We're back with our third series.

00:05:36.376 --> 00:05:37.300
Huge--
ASHLEY: Huzzah!

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.493
MATT: It's awesome. A huge, incredible thank you

00:05:39.493 --> 00:05:42.467
to the amazing creative team involved with the project.

00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:46.649
This issue cover's art by Minttu Hynninen.

00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:48.012
I'm sorry if I got that wrong.

00:05:48.012 --> 00:05:49.086
Writing by Jody Houser.

00:05:49.086 --> 00:05:51.734
Interior line art by Olivia Samson.

00:05:51.734 --> 00:05:53.385
Colored by MSASSYK.

00:05:53.385 --> 00:05:55.653
I always get that wrong, too.

00:05:55.653 --> 00:05:57.595
My apologies, but it's really cool.

00:05:57.595 --> 00:05:59.292
And lettering by Ariana Maher.

00:05:59.292 --> 00:06:00.531
It is great.

00:06:00.531 --> 00:06:03.383
It definitely follows pretty much in line with exploits

00:06:03.383 --> 00:06:05.244
of the home game, which is the whole Origins presence.

00:06:05.244 --> 00:06:07.106
And it's kind of weird to go back to all my old notes

00:06:07.106 --> 00:06:08.999
and our old adventures and be like,

00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:10.498
"Oh, I remember when this happened, that's nuts."

00:06:10.498 --> 00:06:12.006
And then they're brought to an amazing life

00:06:12.006 --> 00:06:13.981
in this series.
TRAVIS: I ate too much queso during that adventure.

00:06:13.981 --> 00:06:16.737
MATT: Yeah. You remember the important parts, right?

00:06:16.737 --> 00:06:17.881
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:06:17.881 --> 00:06:18.714
MATT: If you're able to,

00:06:18.714 --> 00:06:21.079
please support your local comic book shops with this.

00:06:21.079 --> 00:06:23.776
Otherwise, Vox Machina: Origins
series three

00:06:23.776 --> 00:06:25.384
is also available in digital format,

00:06:25.384 --> 00:06:29.408
such as the Dark Horse Comics Digital and comiXology apps.

00:06:29.408 --> 00:06:31.280
Marisha, you have some things to discuss.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.106
MARISHA: I do.
(laughter)

00:06:34.106 --> 00:06:35.981
Oh my gosh.

00:06:35.981 --> 00:06:39.278
So much content, 2021 is here.

00:06:39.278 --> 00:06:42.028
Get ready for a new Mighty Vibes,

00:06:43.343 --> 00:06:48.056
tomorrow Friday, the 12th at 4:00pm Pacific.

00:06:48.056 --> 00:06:51.042
So yeah, tune in.
SAM: Can you say what characters or no?

00:06:51.042 --> 00:06:52.539
MARISHA: I--

00:06:52.539 --> 00:06:54.214
(stammers) it is--

00:06:54.214 --> 00:06:56.483
I will give a hint.
SAM: Don't do it.

00:06:56.483 --> 00:06:59.003
MARISHA: That it's old school characters.

00:06:59.003 --> 00:07:00.370
ALL: Oh!

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:01.653
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:07:01.653 --> 00:07:05.421
Fun, familiar faces from the days of yore.

00:07:05.421 --> 00:07:09.483
Anyway, yeah, you can tune in tomorrow, 4:00pm Pacific,

00:07:09.483 --> 00:07:12.045
and then the VOD will be available on YouTube,

00:07:12.045 --> 00:07:16.106
Sunday, February 14th on Valentine's Day.

00:07:16.106 --> 00:07:16.939
ASHLEY: Aw!

00:07:16.939 --> 00:07:20.031
MARISHA: It'll be great little Valentines background noise.

00:07:20.031 --> 00:07:22.531
And then our next episode of Narrative Telephone

00:07:22.531 --> 00:07:26.154
airs this Tuesday, February 16th at 4:00pm

00:07:26.154 --> 00:07:29.507
with a story told by Liam O'Brien.

00:07:29.507 --> 00:07:31.676
SAM: Oh, yeah.
LIAM: (high-pitched silly laugh)

00:07:31.676 --> 00:07:33.751
MARISHA: It's a good 'un,

00:07:33.751 --> 00:07:35.901
and we have a special guest, Dani Carr,

00:07:35.901 --> 00:07:38.662
in this episode and the VOD will be available

00:07:38.662 --> 00:07:42.808
on YouTube Thursday, February 18th.

00:07:42.808 --> 00:07:46.232
And then later that day is Talks Machina.

00:07:46.232 --> 00:07:47.537
You remember that show.

00:07:47.537 --> 00:07:48.762
SAM: Sure.
(laughter)

00:07:48.762 --> 00:07:51.754
MARISHA: It's still here.
(laughter)

00:07:51.754 --> 00:07:55.989
Yep. February 17th at 7:00pm on Twitch, Pacific.

00:07:55.989 --> 00:07:57.206
Yep. February 17th at 7:00pm on Twitch, Pacific.

00:07:57.206 --> 00:07:59.536
And then of course on YouTube

00:07:59.536 --> 00:08:01.766
after that. Yeah.

00:08:01.766 --> 00:08:06.016
You can join the lovely Brian W. Foster--

00:08:06.016 --> 00:08:08.132
ASHLEY: Yeah!
MARISHA: -- and his guests.

00:08:08.132 --> 00:08:10.381
(laughter)

00:08:11.549 --> 00:08:13.262
That's what it says.

00:08:13.262 --> 00:08:14.446
"And his guests."

00:08:14.446 --> 00:08:16.276
TRAVIS: Ellipses... and his guests.

00:08:16.276 --> 00:08:17.109
ASHLEY: And his guests.

00:08:17.109 --> 00:08:20.333
MARISHA: Yep, and then it's on YouTube on the 18th,

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:21.268
all the content.

00:08:21.268 --> 00:08:23.169
We're moving now.

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:24.351
ASHLEY: We're going.
MARISHA: We're going.

00:08:24.351 --> 00:08:27.570
SAM: Is that our motto? We're moving now!

00:08:27.570 --> 00:08:30.545
TRAVIS: We're cooking with... fire.

00:08:30.545 --> 00:08:31.668
MARISHA: No more fire.
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:08:31.668 --> 00:08:33.874
MARISHA: That's how we started this pandemic.

00:08:33.874 --> 00:08:37.356
MATT: Yeah, that's true, that
is how we started this pandemic.

00:08:37.356 --> 00:08:39.028
All the picture reminders on the phone of, like,

00:08:39.028 --> 00:08:42.664
"Remember back when we were setting our house on fire?"

00:08:42.664 --> 00:08:45.563
Anyway.
(laughter)

00:08:45.563 --> 00:08:48.009
I believe that is the end of our announcements for tonight.

00:08:48.009 --> 00:08:49.609
LIAM: It was a moment.

00:08:49.609 --> 00:08:51.100
MATT: It was.

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:54.016
Let's go ahead and jump into tonight's episode of

00:08:54.016 --> 00:08:55.316
Critical Role.

00:08:56.951 --> 00:08:59.118
(water bubbling)

00:08:59.118 --> 00:09:00.726
(thunder rumbling)

00:09:04.288 --> 00:09:06.412

(dragon roaring)

00:10:32.934 --> 00:10:34.647
MATT: And welcome back.

00:10:34.647 --> 00:10:38.147
So last we left off:

00:10:38.147 --> 00:10:43.147
The Mighty Nein had found themselves in a bit of a quandary.

00:10:44.112 --> 00:10:47.423
Their travel companions in Eiselcross, the Tomb Takers-

00:10:47.423 --> 00:10:51.577
the source of all of the rising tension and danger

00:10:51.577 --> 00:10:54.780
and their intent, it seems, to summon forth

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:59.424
from the Astral plane, the shifting, ever-devouring,

00:10:59.424 --> 00:11:04.424
maddened minds that are the Cognouza Ward,

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:09.050
and the Somnovem of the ancient city of Aeor-

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:10.240
stole your Bag of Holding.

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.495
And you gave chase,

00:11:11.495 --> 00:11:14.497
had an intense battle in which the tides turned

00:11:14.497 --> 00:11:17.414
and you managed to just barely flee

00:11:18.521 --> 00:11:21.294
with one of the two threshold crest they required

00:11:21.294 --> 00:11:23.718
to complete what they needed to do.

00:11:23.718 --> 00:11:25.685
Upon charging into the darkness of night

00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:30.474
and eventually finding hopeful safety along a mountain side,

00:11:30.474 --> 00:11:34.774
you got a night's rest, averted a small avalanche,

00:11:34.774 --> 00:11:38.034
and then headed towards the actual exterior ruins of Aeor

00:11:38.034 --> 00:11:41.829
where you met up with Essek, the Shadowhand himself.

00:11:41.829 --> 00:11:45.044
After sharing some pleasantries, some not so pleasantries

00:11:45.044 --> 00:11:49.108
and a bit of a tense discussion, themes of regret,

00:11:49.108 --> 00:11:53.454
themes of rising danger, and wanting to help prevent

00:11:53.454 --> 00:11:57.362
this coming dangerous arrival,

00:11:57.362 --> 00:12:01.132
led to you all needing to search for allies.

00:12:01.132 --> 00:12:05.763
And so we had left off as you had created

00:12:05.763 --> 00:12:07.354
a teleportation circle leading you back

00:12:07.354 --> 00:12:09.482
to the city of Nicodranas,

00:12:09.482 --> 00:12:11.984
where some of you had begun this adventure

00:12:11.984 --> 00:12:14.490
into the tower of Tide Peak Tower,

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:17.706
and Yussa Errenis, the mage within.

00:12:17.706 --> 00:12:20.491
And so, as you've all now stepped

00:12:20.491 --> 00:12:23.241
through the teleportation circle.

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:26.190
Go ahead and roll a d20 for me, if you don't mind.

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:27.946
LAURA: Oh god.
ASHLEY: Oh boy.

00:12:27.946 --> 00:12:29.785
TRAVIS: All of us?
MATT: Just Caleb.

00:12:29.785 --> 00:12:30.827
LIAM: 16.

00:12:30.827 --> 00:12:31.987
TALIESIN: Let's see if teleportation works.

00:12:31.987 --> 00:12:34.700
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: Oh shit, right.

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:36.826
MATT: You all arrive without issue.

00:12:36.826 --> 00:12:38.206
You're stepping into the stone floor

00:12:38.206 --> 00:12:40.131
on the inside of Tide Peak tower.

00:12:40.131 --> 00:12:43.056
Very faintly lit, the same darkened arrival chamber

00:12:43.056 --> 00:12:45.670
that you're used to greets you.

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:47.841
And there you see, waiting by the door,

00:12:47.841 --> 00:12:50.347
the familiar appearance of Wensforth,

00:12:50.347 --> 00:12:54.514
the goblin associate to Yussa himself,

00:12:54.514 --> 00:12:56.865
as you all step in.

00:12:56.865 --> 00:12:59.622
"Glad you all could make it.

00:12:59.622 --> 00:13:02.424
"I'll take it you want to speak with the master."

00:13:02.424 --> 00:13:04.843
LIAM: I hope we are not barging in on you

00:13:04.843 --> 00:13:06.883
at an inopportune time.

00:13:06.883 --> 00:13:10.307
MATT: "I-I don't think so, I was just sort of cleaning up.

00:13:10.307 --> 00:13:12.560
"So follow me."

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.855
And he goes and leads you guys up to familiar stairway

00:13:14.855 --> 00:13:19.655
to the central greeting/half-laboratory chamber

00:13:19.655 --> 00:13:22.741
where you had previously attempted the ritual

00:13:22.741 --> 00:13:27.542
to restore Veth not that long ago.

00:13:27.542 --> 00:13:30.804
There, you see Yussa is currently sitting at a desk,

00:13:30.804 --> 00:13:33.987
the furniture has been reset and fixed since the chaos

00:13:33.987 --> 00:13:35.739
of that moment in time.

00:13:35.739 --> 00:13:37.116
The window was partially open

00:13:37.116 --> 00:13:38.905
with a bit of daylight coming through,

00:13:38.905 --> 00:13:42.539
and you can see Yussa hunched over the desk,

00:13:42.539 --> 00:13:45.810
tomes open and the Happy Fun Ball set upon

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:47.857
a small pedestal in front.

00:13:47.857 --> 00:13:50.692
In the process of writing and scribing within there,

00:13:50.692 --> 00:13:52.610
stops and sets down the quill

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:55.443
and turns over to face all of you.

00:13:56.291 --> 00:13:58.124
(as Yussa) "Hello, you've made it.

00:13:59.441 --> 00:14:00.811
"You've arrived.

00:14:00.811 --> 00:14:03.627
"What could I do for you?"

00:14:03.627 --> 00:14:05.379
LIAM: This is a rare instance.

00:14:05.379 --> 00:14:06.464
We're not just passing through,

00:14:06.464 --> 00:14:09.426
we have come seeking you specifically,

00:14:09.426 --> 00:14:11.882
if you have time to converse with us.

00:14:11.882 --> 00:14:14.686
MATT: "Well, I certainly at the moment have time,

00:14:14.686 --> 00:14:17.235
"so let us discuss, yes.

00:14:17.235 --> 00:14:19.152
"What is it you require?"

00:14:20.191 --> 00:14:21.356
LIAM: Oh, this is a long story

00:14:21.356 --> 00:14:23.150
that we are going to have to keep telling.

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:24.556
MATT: You can just say you--

00:14:24.556 --> 00:14:27.287
LAURA: We tell the story.
(laughter)

00:14:27.287 --> 00:14:29.344
TRAVIS: (speaking gibberish)

00:14:29.344 --> 00:14:30.177
MATT: Mm-hmm.

00:14:33.242 --> 00:14:34.313
"Well, that's--"

00:14:34.313 --> 00:14:36.563
(laughter)

00:14:38.159 --> 00:14:40.987
"-- quite a bit seems to have transpired since last we met.

00:14:40.987 --> 00:14:43.140
"You had mentioned a few of these strange visions

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:46.995
"in this city, this living city you had seen

00:14:46.995 --> 00:14:48.745
"in some of your visions.

00:14:50.048 --> 00:14:53.906
"Well, it's a sticky situation.

00:14:55.596 --> 00:14:58.889
"So how can I help you?"

00:14:58.889 --> 00:15:00.496
LIAM: Well, how familiar are you

00:15:00.496 --> 00:15:03.913
with any of it before we told this story?

00:15:05.224 --> 00:15:07.710
MATT: "Not too much with the specifics of it.

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:11.602
"I am familiar with the idea of Aeor,

00:15:11.602 --> 00:15:16.071
"just that some elements of its historical presence.

00:15:16.071 --> 00:15:19.197
"And I've heard rumors, I believe we had spoken before,

00:15:19.197 --> 00:15:23.629
"that its ruins had been uncovered,
to an extent, to the north,

00:15:23.629 --> 00:15:25.678
"but along with those rumors,

00:15:25.678 --> 00:15:29.478
"strange, aberrant alterations

00:15:29.478 --> 00:15:31.896
"of the flow of magic.

00:15:31.896 --> 00:15:35.190
"Such mages have traveled there and spoken

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:39.722
"how dangerous their capabilities are in that proximity,

00:15:39.722 --> 00:15:40.897
"those who returned, at least.

00:15:40.897 --> 00:15:43.980
"So I have not ventured myself, as I...

00:15:45.438 --> 00:15:46.520
"Let's just say I have a priority

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:50.020
"in maintaining my existence on Exandria."

00:15:54.083 --> 00:15:57.875
LIAM: And nothing of the history of the people there,

00:15:57.875 --> 00:15:59.792
or these philosophers.

00:16:00.751 --> 00:16:03.681
Is it that shrouded in history?

00:16:03.681 --> 00:16:08.649
MATT: "I am not necessarily a major in all parts of history.

00:16:08.649 --> 00:16:10.564
"As far as Aeorians specifically,

00:16:10.564 --> 00:16:12.109
"I'm not a scholar in that space.

00:16:12.109 --> 00:16:16.776
"My preference more seems to lie in extra planar aspects,

00:16:18.454 --> 00:16:21.292
"antiquity of known history,

00:16:21.292 --> 00:16:25.054
"and, in recent years, local politics."

00:16:25.054 --> 00:16:27.096
He glances out towards the window in his office

00:16:27.096 --> 00:16:28.929
with a bit of a glare.

00:16:30.184 --> 00:16:32.025
"It's a bit out of my realm of expertise,

00:16:32.025 --> 00:16:37.025
"but I've heard various things

00:16:37.115 --> 00:16:40.576
"as many who delve into the arcana do

00:16:40.576 --> 00:16:44.720
"which involves that they were
a very powerful mobile nation.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:49.401
"One of many. Struck down at some point in the Calamity

00:16:49.401 --> 00:16:51.209
"by the ire of the gods, but--

00:16:54.084 --> 00:16:57.126
"Specifics beyond that, I'm afraid that's not my bailiwick."

00:16:57.126 --> 00:17:01.293
LAURA: Do you know of anybody that that did study Aeor?

00:17:03.883 --> 00:17:07.541
MATT: "The thing is, most arcanists of my stature,

00:17:07.541 --> 00:17:11.157
MATT: "The thing is, most arcanists of my stature,

00:17:12.636 --> 00:17:16.339
"we maintain mostly a competitive air. (laughs)

00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:19.814
"Friendships are not easy to find.

00:17:19.814 --> 00:17:23.306
"Covetous at a certain point of power, I suppose.

00:17:23.306 --> 00:17:26.021
"I only keep a few close at hand.

00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:28.700
"You've already met one, though

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:31.791
"I'm uncertain as to her expertise in this field.

00:17:31.791 --> 00:17:33.901
"So you could certainly inquire.

00:17:33.901 --> 00:17:37.321
"I could reach out, if you'd like."

00:17:37.321 --> 00:17:40.940
LIAM: Well, in a parallel line of discussion.

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:44.331
And I pick up the Folding Halls of Halas.

00:17:44.331 --> 00:17:45.908
MATT: Right, as you go and reach for it on the table,

00:17:45.908 --> 00:17:48.872
you see him, "Ah," just like an instinctually,

00:17:48.872 --> 00:17:51.410
not quite Gollum-esque, but like this has been his thing,

00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:52.443
had studied it for a while.

00:17:52.443 --> 00:17:55.815
The minute somebody starts reaching for it he like, "Ah."

00:17:55.815 --> 00:17:58.057
LIAM: I'm ginger with it.

00:17:59.682 --> 00:18:02.755
You have been studying this, I presume.

00:18:02.755 --> 00:18:07.755
MATT: "I have, I've gone on two journeys within,

00:18:08.508 --> 00:18:11.930
"lucky enough to have returned from both."

00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:14.657
LIAM: It's curious, in our time in here,

00:18:14.657 --> 00:18:19.369
we met the architect, so to speak.

00:18:19.369 --> 00:18:23.839
MATT: "Indeed, I helped shuffle away his essence for you."

00:18:23.839 --> 00:18:24.672
LIAM: Yeah.

00:18:26.555 --> 00:18:29.097
Wondering if he is

00:18:31.507 --> 00:18:35.569
reachable, I suppose, in a short amount of time,

00:18:35.569 --> 00:18:37.747
and we're wondering if you and your time with this

00:18:37.747 --> 00:18:39.447
have learned the ways of its functioning,

00:18:39.447 --> 00:18:42.995
have learned the ways of its functioning,

00:18:42.995 --> 00:18:47.078
and the passage of time within it and without it.

00:18:47.924 --> 00:18:50.726
And we're curious to see if you,

00:18:50.726 --> 00:18:52.056
I'm not sure that we want to do this,

00:18:52.056 --> 00:18:57.056
but would be open to us maybe having one more visit inside.

00:18:57.648 --> 00:18:58.943
MATT: "If you would be interested.

00:18:58.943 --> 00:19:03.078
"I mean, you're the ones who preven-- gave it to me.

00:19:03.078 --> 00:19:06.230
"You may enter it as you see fit.

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:10.143
"I have mapped out a handful of rooms in my time.

00:19:10.143 --> 00:19:12.675
"Being an individual, care must be taken

00:19:12.675 --> 00:19:14.003
"with each progressive stage,

00:19:14.003 --> 00:19:17.311
"especially as individuals like Halas are keen

00:19:17.311 --> 00:19:21.478
"to ward it against other such magic practitioners.

00:19:22.983 --> 00:19:26.182
"I believe you encountered such dangers as well.

00:19:26.182 --> 00:19:29.976
"I have not yet located the device that controls

00:19:29.976 --> 00:19:33.608
"the transition and speed of the passage of time.

00:19:33.608 --> 00:19:35.858
"So it is still accelerated.

00:19:36.983 --> 00:19:39.816
"But if you would wish to journey within,

00:19:39.816 --> 00:19:41.266
"you are welcome to.

00:19:41.266 --> 00:19:43.755
"If you wish to speak with Halas,

00:19:43.755 --> 00:19:47.481
"I can pluck the gem from the pocket space

00:19:47.481 --> 00:19:49.947
"in which I buried it.

00:19:49.947 --> 00:19:54.089
"But once again, as you are well aware,

00:19:55.032 --> 00:19:57.134
"such an entity imprisoned for so long

00:19:57.134 --> 00:19:58.833
"with such intelligence and cunning

00:19:58.833 --> 00:20:01.924
"is a dangerous thing to converse within indeed."

00:20:01.924 --> 00:20:02.991
TRAVIS: Just out of curiosity,

00:20:02.991 --> 00:20:07.974
have you mapped any new rooms within Halls of Halas?

00:20:09.456 --> 00:20:11.366
MATT: You show the map over there.

00:20:11.366 --> 00:20:14.135
Yeah, he looks and he goes,

00:20:14.135 --> 00:20:17.251
"Primarily, it's combing through what you've missed.

00:20:17.251 --> 00:20:19.584
"Nothing too far beyond that.

00:20:20.791 --> 00:20:22.603
"How long has it been since last we spoke?"

00:20:22.603 --> 00:20:23.933
LAURA: (laughs nervously)

00:20:23.933 --> 00:20:27.788
Yeah, Caleb would remember, he's got a very Keen Mind.

00:20:27.788 --> 00:20:29.027
MATT: It's been a handful of weeks

00:20:29.027 --> 00:20:32.527
since last spoke with you spoke with Yussa.

00:20:34.336 --> 00:20:37.549
"I've only been in there about a handful of days.

00:20:37.549 --> 00:20:39.058
"As you know, the progressive passage of time

00:20:39.058 --> 00:20:40.097
"makes it challenging.

00:20:40.097 --> 00:20:42.905
"So while this has been maybe a longer distance for you.

00:20:42.905 --> 00:20:46.499
"It's been a much shorter blip in my personal experience.

00:20:46.499 --> 00:20:51.155
"So my traversing is limited

00:20:51.155 --> 00:20:54.136
"until I can locate the center piece of this device.

00:20:54.136 --> 00:20:57.754
"I am not one to wander too far or do an expensive breakdown

00:20:57.754 --> 00:21:00.394
"of the Folding Halls until I can prevent it

00:21:00.394 --> 00:21:04.652
"from consuming more time than is necessary."

00:21:06.095 --> 00:21:07.571
LAURA: Make sense.
TALIESIN: Hmm.

00:21:07.571 --> 00:21:10.427
LIAM: But you are saying that you have a bit of a shortcut

00:21:10.427 --> 00:21:14.126
you can reach in and bring our friend out of it.

00:21:14.126 --> 00:21:16.391
LAURA: Oh, no, just the jewel that holds his soul, remember?

00:21:16.391 --> 00:21:20.021
His body, we left inside, but the jewel...

00:21:20.021 --> 00:21:21.276
TRAVIS: He has on him.

00:21:21.276 --> 00:21:22.109
LIAM: Well, I thought he was--

00:21:22.109 --> 00:21:23.282
TRAVIS: Ish.

00:21:23.282 --> 00:21:26.865
LIAM: -- inferring that he had arranged something.

00:21:27.864 --> 00:21:29.265
MATT: Well, if you recall, when you guys gave him--

00:21:29.265 --> 00:21:30.743
LIAM: We dumped him in a prison in there.

00:21:30.743 --> 00:21:31.775
MATT: The body, yes.

00:21:31.775 --> 00:21:33.111
But the gem that holds his soul,

00:21:33.111 --> 00:21:35.142
he went ahead and folded it away in a pocket dimension.

00:21:35.142 --> 00:21:36.855
TRAVIS: Can we converse with the gem?
LIAM: But that's what I'm saying.

00:21:36.855 --> 00:21:39.185
The gem, we spoke to him in the gem.

00:21:39.185 --> 00:21:40.724
So that's what I'm assuming we would be doing here.

00:21:40.724 --> 00:21:42.483
LAURA: Yeah, we don't have to go inside.

00:21:42.483 --> 00:21:43.316
LIAM: No, I don't need the body,

00:21:43.316 --> 00:21:44.582
I need his brain.
TRAVIS: Is there any danger of him

00:21:44.582 --> 00:21:45.582
hopping out of the gem

00:21:45.582 --> 00:21:47.611
if we tried to--
LIAM: Yes, there is.

00:21:47.611 --> 00:21:52.209
SAM: Or corrupting the person that he speaks with.

00:21:52.209 --> 00:21:54.429
I think I spoke with him last time.

00:21:54.429 --> 00:21:56.679
ASHLEY: I'll speak with him.
I'm sure nothing will happen to me.

00:21:56.679 --> 00:21:57.858
SAM: Oh yeah, that's a great idea.

00:21:57.858 --> 00:21:59.620
Well, you're strong.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:02.396
TRAVIS: Yeah, just rage before
you do it and be like (growling).

00:22:02.396 --> 00:22:04.266
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's true.
MATT: Rage conversation.

00:22:04.266 --> 00:22:05.683
TRAVIS: Strong of mind.
LAURA: (yells)

00:22:06.738 --> 00:22:08.606
MATT: It's just shouting at the gem.

00:22:08.606 --> 00:22:11.982
LAURA: Yussa, would you be interested in going to Aeor

00:22:11.982 --> 00:22:13.411
and finding a whole bunch of relics

00:22:13.411 --> 00:22:16.364
that would be really interesting, and you could study them,

00:22:16.364 --> 00:22:19.413
and probably a lot of other mages

00:22:19.413 --> 00:22:22.904
wouldn't have access to those relics

00:22:22.904 --> 00:22:24.129
and you would probably know more

00:22:24.129 --> 00:22:29.129
than your fellow arcane practitioners.

00:22:29.148 --> 00:22:30.687
LIAM: Just a little danger.

00:22:30.687 --> 00:22:32.917
MATT: Roll a persuasion check.

00:22:32.917 --> 00:22:33.750
SAM: Oh boy.

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:37.573
LAURA: Okay.

00:22:38.608 --> 00:22:40.691
SAM: (laughs)

00:22:44.091 --> 00:22:44.961
LAURA: 16.

00:22:44.961 --> 00:22:46.128
MATT: 16. He goes,

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:54.207
"While I am behind what it is you're attempting,

00:22:56.038 --> 00:22:58.908
"and I mean this with all due respect,

00:22:58.908 --> 00:23:02.975
"the danger of someone as focused in my arts as I am

00:23:02.975 --> 00:23:06.200
"in such a place unnerves me.

00:23:08.654 --> 00:23:13.404
"I appreciate the comfort of control over my capabilities.

00:23:16.535 --> 00:23:20.285
"However, I can aid you perhaps in other ways.

00:23:22.664 --> 00:23:24.561
"Just a moment,"

00:23:24.561 --> 00:23:29.428
and he sits up from his stool and heads over towards,

00:23:29.428 --> 00:23:30.953
looks like a curtain towards one of the walls

00:23:30.953 --> 00:23:33.834
and steps beyond the curtain and it falls behind him.

00:23:33.834 --> 00:23:37.456
It's thick, almost blue, shiny velvet curtain.

00:23:37.456 --> 00:23:39.205
And a moment later, he steps back out

00:23:39.205 --> 00:23:44.205
and he has this unique-looking, gold spiral scepter.

00:23:45.152 --> 00:23:48.318
It has a hollow center and it spirals a bit to a handle.

00:23:48.318 --> 00:23:49.994
At the very edge, the tip of it,

00:23:49.994 --> 00:23:53.869
it seems to go into a talon or a hook made of opal.

00:23:55.085 --> 00:23:58.620
LAURA: That's very beautiful.
TRAVIS: Back scratcher.

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:02.366
MATT: You see, he has a small leather pouch

00:24:02.366 --> 00:24:04.046
about that big that he has at his side

00:24:04.046 --> 00:24:07.298
and sets them down on the table.

00:24:07.298 --> 00:24:11.487
"These are objects that I do not need at the moment.

00:24:11.487 --> 00:24:13.303
"These are objects that I do not need at the moment.

00:24:13.303 --> 00:24:18.303
"I prefer to keep my personal defenses on myself.

00:24:18.309 --> 00:24:22.636
"Once again, jealous types.

00:24:22.636 --> 00:24:24.604
"But if you would like to take these

00:24:24.604 --> 00:24:27.149
"for the length of your journey, maybe there'll be helpful."

00:24:27.149 --> 00:24:29.319
LIAM: And what are we talking about here?

00:24:29.319 --> 00:24:31.183
MATT: "This," and he pulls back the pouch.

00:24:31.183 --> 00:24:34.431
You see two rather decent-sized potions

00:24:34.431 --> 00:24:39.098
of a familiar herbal, reddish, peach coloration.

00:24:40.281 --> 00:24:43.462
"These should tend to some of
your wounds with a quick imbibing,"

00:24:43.462 --> 00:24:45.409
and he slides it forward to the edge of the table,

00:24:45.409 --> 00:24:49.099
as he reaches out for the sphere.

00:24:49.099 --> 00:24:49.932
LIAM: Oh!

00:24:51.228 --> 00:24:52.907
TRAVIS: Somebody else write down the stuff

00:24:52.907 --> 00:24:54.072
because I don't have a bag any more.

00:24:54.072 --> 00:24:54.957
LAURA: Oh!

00:24:54.957 --> 00:24:57.229
MATT: So two potions of superior healing.

00:24:57.229 --> 00:24:59.809
TRAVIS: Oh! Yo.
MARISHA: Superior healing.

00:24:59.809 --> 00:25:02.091
SAM: Are you going to write them?
ASHLEY: I'm writing 'em down.

00:25:02.091 --> 00:25:03.791
SAM: Okay, Ashley's got it.

00:25:05.387 --> 00:25:07.451
MARISHA: I'm just going to write it out on my scratch.

00:25:07.451 --> 00:25:11.766
MATT: "This is a scepter of blasting.

00:25:11.766 --> 00:25:14.759
"It has a series of small enchantments within,

00:25:14.759 --> 00:25:18.622
"but hopefully it'll find some use within your troupe,"

00:25:18.622 --> 00:25:19.841
and he hands it over.

00:25:19.841 --> 00:25:23.894
Then you can find that within your D&amp;D Beyond.

00:25:23.894 --> 00:25:26.633
TRAVIS: Try it out, try it out.
MATT: Blast scepter.

00:25:26.633 --> 00:25:28.292
LIAM: Fjord, hold still.

00:25:29.636 --> 00:25:31.303
TRAVIS: You know I'm game.

00:25:32.272 --> 00:25:34.870
LAURA: ♪ (triumphant trumpet) ♪

00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:36.229
LIAM: Okay.
SAM: This is exciting.

00:25:36.229 --> 00:25:38.673
ASHLEY: The scepter of blasting is
the one with the little opal?

00:25:38.673 --> 00:25:39.506
MATT: Yeah.

00:25:41.005 --> 00:25:42.703
LIAM: Blasting.
MATT: Yeah.

00:25:42.703 --> 00:25:44.016
LIAM: There it is.

00:25:44.016 --> 00:25:45.099
SAM: What's it do?

00:25:45.099 --> 00:25:46.798
MARISHA: Tell me, I don't want to look it up.

00:25:46.798 --> 00:25:49.565
LAURA: Gains resistance to fire and lightning damage

00:25:49.565 --> 00:25:53.545
and can, as an action, use it to cast-- ooh!--

00:25:53.545 --> 00:25:56.355
Thunderwave at a 4th-level spell

00:25:56.355 --> 00:25:58.153
without expending a spell slot.

00:25:58.153 --> 00:26:00.454
TRAVIS: Yo.
MARISHA: That's cool.

00:26:00.454 --> 00:26:03.686
TRAVIS: Just by holding it?
LAURA: Just by holding it.

00:26:03.686 --> 00:26:06.005
TRAVIS: Does it have offensive capabilities?

00:26:06.005 --> 00:26:07.217
LAURA: It requires attunement.

00:26:07.217 --> 00:26:09.222
SAM and LIAM: (disappointed) Oh.

00:26:09.222 --> 00:26:10.205
TRAVIS: Uh.

00:26:10.205 --> 00:26:12.199
(laughter)

00:26:12.199 --> 00:26:15.984
I would hate to get rid of my ring of fire protection.

00:26:15.984 --> 00:26:17.880
(laughter)

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:22.337
TALIESIN: I mean, weirdly,
you still get fire resistance with this.

00:26:22.337 --> 00:26:23.483
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:26:23.483 --> 00:26:25.119
TALIESIN: It's kind of a clean...

00:26:25.119 --> 00:26:27.061
MATT: You just got a hold a scepter.

00:26:27.061 --> 00:26:29.293
TRAVIS: (wheezing) For free!
LAURA: You should take it.

00:26:29.293 --> 00:26:31.022
TRAVIS: (wheezing) I gotta sell this fucking ring.

00:26:31.022 --> 00:26:33.272
(laughter)

00:26:36.426 --> 00:26:38.036
MATT: Can't hold a shield with a scepter, though.

00:26:38.036 --> 00:26:39.684
TRAVIS: Oh, there you go.

00:26:39.684 --> 00:26:42.257
Got to have that shield.

00:26:42.257 --> 00:26:45.507
SAM: Do you think you'll these items back?

00:26:46.727 --> 00:26:50.271
MATT: "Eventually, when you feel you've satisfactorily

00:26:50.271 --> 00:26:55.012
"completed your encroachment
of this danger and seal it away."

00:26:55.012 --> 00:26:58.222
LAURA: We're all going to die, so you might not get it back.

00:26:58.222 --> 00:27:01.256
MATT: "Well, even more of a reason for me to stay behind,

00:27:01.256 --> 00:27:05.006
"but I believe in you.

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:08.900
"Look, of course, I'm curious about Aeor.

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:13.664
"Any one of my background and passions is,

00:27:13.664 --> 00:27:16.285
"but it has a reputation for a reason.

00:27:16.285 --> 00:27:17.188
"And I'm here,

00:27:17.188 --> 00:27:20.971
"I've lived as long as I have from being careful.

00:27:20.971 --> 00:27:22.032
"If things get out of hand,

00:27:22.032 --> 00:27:26.836
"I can reach out to a number of allies in hindsight,

00:27:26.836 --> 00:27:28.882
"and perhaps come in as a second wave.

00:27:28.882 --> 00:27:33.007
"But if you can handle this, then I'm...

00:27:34.302 --> 00:27:38.469
"Well, I would rather not put myself in harm's way."

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:43.289
LIAM: That's understandable.

00:27:43.289 --> 00:27:46.649
MATT: "I apologize, but--"
LIAM: Not at all.

00:27:46.649 --> 00:27:49.402
MATT: "You have succeeded at great many things

00:27:49.402 --> 00:27:54.402
"and I believe that you will have a drive and a passion,

00:27:55.092 --> 00:27:57.642
"and friends behind you.

00:27:58.968 --> 00:28:01.914
"You may have what it takes to handle this without me."

00:28:03.439 --> 00:28:07.331
LIAM: Well, I suppose the question
I have for the Nein of us is,

00:28:08.495 --> 00:28:11.586
is it worth the risk for one of us to try to speak to Halas,

00:28:11.586 --> 00:28:14.381
since he is of the time period?

00:28:14.381 --> 00:28:18.099
MARISHA: I feel like I recall asking him if he knew--

00:28:18.099 --> 00:28:20.984
LIAM: Of the philosophers of the Somnovem?

00:28:20.984 --> 00:28:24.800
MARISHA: I feel like I've asked him about--

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:25.883
I don't know.

00:28:27.719 --> 00:28:29.901
LIAM: We didn't know about
any of the things we know about now.

00:28:29.901 --> 00:28:32.201
MARISHA: No, nothing new.

00:28:33.118 --> 00:28:34.535
It'd be worth it.

00:28:35.456 --> 00:28:37.955
I just wonder what information he might have.

00:28:37.955 --> 00:28:42.595
LIAM: I would be willing to hold the gem if,

00:28:42.595 --> 00:28:46.478
Fjord, you, and Yussa, you would

00:28:46.478 --> 00:28:48.753
work to prevent me from leaving.

00:28:49.765 --> 00:28:50.964
TRAVIS: Yes.
LIAM: You know what I mean?

00:28:50.964 --> 00:28:52.395
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.
MATT: "Indeed."

00:28:52.395 --> 00:28:57.395
LIAM: And then, you know, hurting me if need be.

00:28:57.683 --> 00:28:58.683
SAM: I'm sorry?

00:29:00.376 --> 00:29:04.596
LIAM: Well, he's an archmage that has
survived across the eons.

00:29:04.596 --> 00:29:09.179
He's dangerous, but the information, we know so little.

00:29:10.461 --> 00:29:12.510
I think it is worth it.

00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:14.542
TRAVIS: Yes, I agree.

00:29:14.542 --> 00:29:18.911
I will certainly fuck you up if it is necessary.

00:29:18.911 --> 00:29:20.887
LAURA: Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

00:29:20.887 --> 00:29:23.242
LIAM: First thing is to make sure
that I do not leave the tower

00:29:23.242 --> 00:29:25.388
in the blink of an eye.

00:29:25.388 --> 00:29:29.423
TRAVIS: Yep, got it. I'll have that on standby.

00:29:29.423 --> 00:29:32.620
TALIESIN: Can we take all of your tools,

00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:36.186
all of your ingredients?

00:29:41.693 --> 00:29:42.635
Only what you need.

00:29:42.635 --> 00:29:43.914
LIAM: Yes, yes, yes, yes.

00:29:43.914 --> 00:29:46.170
I am just thinking if there is anything

00:29:46.170 --> 00:29:48.253
that I should hold onto.

00:29:49.453 --> 00:29:52.059
Probably just my lucky stone.

00:29:52.059 --> 00:29:55.406
LAURA: I could Enhance Abilities on you.

00:29:55.406 --> 00:30:00.079
I could up your wisdom or I could up your charisma.

00:30:00.079 --> 00:30:03.443
Either one might be useful when talking to him.

00:30:03.443 --> 00:30:05.053
TALIESIN: And I can give you a Bless.

00:30:05.053 --> 00:30:07.300
TRAVIS: I could give you Shield of Faith.

00:30:08.478 --> 00:30:10.403
SAM: I could give you some buttons.

00:30:12.146 --> 00:30:16.564
LIAM: This is tricky because anything
that I have to resist him,

00:30:16.564 --> 00:30:19.164
he could also use to resist you

00:30:20.564 --> 00:30:22.957
if I am no longer in control of my faculties.

00:30:26.324 --> 00:30:27.644
Just be ready to fuck me up.

00:30:27.644 --> 00:30:28.674
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:30:28.674 --> 00:30:31.664
LAURA: I'm going to cast Enhance Ability on you anyway.

00:30:31.664 --> 00:30:33.074
I'm going to enhance your charisma

00:30:33.074 --> 00:30:34.454
because you're going to have to persuade him

00:30:34.454 --> 00:30:35.514
to talk to you. I have a feeling.

00:30:35.514 --> 00:30:37.944
He's not going to want to give things up.

00:30:37.944 --> 00:30:40.524
LIAM: What does that do gameplay-wise again?

00:30:40.524 --> 00:30:42.694
LAURA: It gives you advantage--

00:30:42.694 --> 00:30:44.274
MATT: On charisma ability checks.

00:30:44.274 --> 00:30:45.107
LIAM: Okay.

00:30:45.107 --> 00:30:46.674
TRAVIS: I'm also going to cast Shield of Faith

00:30:46.674 --> 00:30:48.961
because I've never used it before. (laughs)

00:30:48.961 --> 00:30:50.469
LIAM: Yeah, paladin!
TRAVIS: But I really should.

00:30:50.469 --> 00:30:51.594
LIAM: Yeah, pally!

00:30:51.594 --> 00:30:53.939
MATT: Plus two to your AC.

00:30:53.939 --> 00:30:55.631
For 10 minutes.
MARISHA: Oh, that's cool.

00:30:57.644 --> 00:31:00.104
TALIESIN: And once we start, I'll get Bless on you.

00:31:00.104 --> 00:31:00.937
LIAM: Okay.

00:31:00.937 --> 00:31:03.704
MATT: "So you're to speak with Halas?"

00:31:03.704 --> 00:31:04.794
LIAM: Correct.

00:31:04.794 --> 00:31:06.252
MATT: "Very well."

00:31:06.252 --> 00:31:07.085
TALIESIN: Bless.

00:31:07.085 --> 00:31:09.104
MATT: Yussa stands, straightens his shoulders a bit

00:31:09.104 --> 00:31:11.714
and you watch as his fingers almost seem

00:31:11.714 --> 00:31:13.474
to tug at an invisible thread.

00:31:13.474 --> 00:31:15.494
And as he pulls it across the front of him,

00:31:15.494 --> 00:31:19.148
you hear this faint tearing sound, this (ripping).

00:31:19.148 --> 00:31:21.964
You watch a small fold in spacetime

00:31:21.964 --> 00:31:25.821
open and as it does, the gem shining falls out.

00:31:25.821 --> 00:31:29.244
He almost catches it in his hand,

00:31:29.244 --> 00:31:31.934
and instead it just stays gravitating floating in the air,

00:31:31.934 --> 00:31:34.974
held aloft by a Mage Hand of some kind.

00:31:34.974 --> 00:31:36.224
LIAM: Smarty.

00:31:36.224 --> 00:31:39.924
MATT: As it closes, he drifts it over in your direction

00:31:39.924 --> 00:31:42.474
and you see the gem's slowly corkscrewing

00:31:42.474 --> 00:31:44.264
in the air towards you before stopping right

00:31:44.264 --> 00:31:47.284
in front of you just gently, quietly rotating,

00:31:47.284 --> 00:31:49.394
shining with a bit of light coming through the window

00:31:49.394 --> 00:31:52.555
making it bright, a deep red, a beautiful red.

00:31:57.368 --> 00:31:58.882
MARISHA: You know what you're asking him?

00:32:00.524 --> 00:32:01.874
LIAM: Groupthink it right now.

00:32:03.494 --> 00:32:07.144
I want to know about Cognouza.

00:32:07.144 --> 00:32:08.609
MARISHA: Cognouza Ward and the Somnovem?

00:32:08.609 --> 00:32:09.442
LIAM: The philosophers.

00:32:10.514 --> 00:32:14.384
MARISHA: I'm also very curious what he may know

00:32:14.384 --> 00:32:18.658
of these beacons and what they meant in his time.

00:32:18.658 --> 00:32:20.083
LAURA: Oh yeah, that's important.

00:32:24.326 --> 00:32:26.026
TRAVIS: How they can be destroyed?

00:32:28.079 --> 00:32:28.912
LAURA: Or--

00:32:30.334 --> 00:32:32.964
LIAM: The beacon, the Luxon.

00:32:32.964 --> 00:32:34.164
TRAVIS: How many does he need?

00:32:36.406 --> 00:32:38.214
LAURA: How many threshold crests?

00:32:38.214 --> 00:32:39.504
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:32:39.504 --> 00:32:42.834
Sorry, you got-- without me even saying.

00:32:46.517 --> 00:32:51.044
MARISHA: How do you fight a screaming, mad city?

00:32:51.044 --> 00:32:52.407
Flying through the abyss?

00:32:55.384 --> 00:32:56.584
Don't ask that question.

00:32:58.314 --> 00:33:00.754
LIAM: They might not be of exactly the same time, either.

00:33:00.754 --> 00:33:03.577
It is not a definite, but.

00:33:07.684 --> 00:33:08.517
All right.

00:33:12.214 --> 00:33:14.874
MATT: As your fingers touch the cold stone,

00:33:16.664 --> 00:33:20.514
you feel this chill run down from the base of your neck

00:33:20.514 --> 00:33:22.067
to the base of your spine.

00:33:23.184 --> 00:33:25.524
And immediately the temperature warms to your touch,

00:33:25.524 --> 00:33:27.644
like the gem is matching the temperature

00:33:27.644 --> 00:33:32.308
of your own skin and you hear a voice filter in

00:33:32.308 --> 00:33:34.958
sourcelessly to the center of your mind.

00:33:36.117 --> 00:33:37.600
"Ah.

00:33:39.444 --> 00:33:42.547
"So who do I have the pleasure of speaking with right now?"

00:33:44.844 --> 00:33:45.960
LIAM: <i>Ja,</i> hello?

00:33:47.674 --> 00:33:49.449
My name is Caleb Widogast.

00:33:52.894 --> 00:33:54.002
And you are?

00:33:56.824 --> 00:33:58.824
MATT: "You already know who I am."

00:33:58.824 --> 00:34:01.124
LIAM: I have yet to have the pleasure

00:34:01.124 --> 00:34:02.124
of conversation with you.

00:34:02.124 --> 00:34:03.619
I was hoping to hear you say it.

00:34:07.034 --> 00:34:08.097
MATT: "You--

00:34:10.794 --> 00:34:15.427
"I can sense something flowing through you.

00:34:17.225 --> 00:34:20.900
"There is a hint

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:23.925
"of arcane energy that just drifts.

00:34:25.554 --> 00:34:28.507
"You are a practitioner, yes?"

00:34:30.614 --> 00:34:33.857
LIAM: I am a prolific student of life.

00:34:35.494 --> 00:34:39.777
MATT: "Then there is much that we could see eye to eye on."

00:34:43.204 --> 00:34:45.079
LIAM: Do you know where you are?

00:34:46.324 --> 00:34:47.524
When you are?

00:34:50.234 --> 00:34:52.229
MATT: "Not in particular, no.

00:34:52.229 --> 00:34:55.204
"An unfortunate side effect of a--

00:34:55.204 --> 00:34:59.827
"an unforeseen, vengeful retort."

00:35:04.044 --> 00:35:07.060
LIAM: Well, you have met a few of my friends already.

00:35:08.004 --> 00:35:10.559
Just think back to the last conversations you had

00:35:10.559 --> 00:35:13.524
in the previous 2000 years. That would be them.

00:35:13.524 --> 00:35:15.271
MATT: "A returning interest.

00:35:15.271 --> 00:35:18.834
"You come back to me after such encounters?

00:35:18.834 --> 00:35:22.609
"I sense a faint element of desperation."

00:35:24.244 --> 00:35:27.117
LIAM: We do have questions.

00:35:27.117 --> 00:35:30.839
MATT: "Good, I have requests.

00:35:35.104 --> 00:35:38.357
"What do you wish to ask me, Caleb Widogast?"

00:35:41.994 --> 00:35:43.294
SAM: Can we hear what--?

00:35:43.294 --> 00:35:44.844
MATT: No, you can hear him talking.

00:35:44.844 --> 00:35:46.816
You do not hear Halas.

00:35:48.662 --> 00:35:51.006
LIAM: I wish to know of your time.

00:35:53.504 --> 00:35:54.557
When you lived.

00:35:56.644 --> 00:35:57.767
Of where you lived.

00:36:00.104 --> 00:36:04.002
And I wish to know of Aeor.

00:36:07.338 --> 00:36:08.240
MATT: "Hmm."

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:10.834
LIAM: Is that the span of your lifetime?

00:36:10.834 --> 00:36:12.537
When Aeor was at its zenith?

00:36:16.994 --> 00:36:21.340
MATT: "I will say Aeor crumbled before my time,

00:36:22.354 --> 00:36:27.354
"but its folly was known in my upbringing."

00:36:31.734 --> 00:36:35.207
LIAM: How far in your past did it fall from the sky?

00:36:36.524 --> 00:36:37.357
MATT: "Well,

00:36:41.364 --> 00:36:46.350
"I grow quite frustrated with my predicament.

00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:47.716
"I grow quite frustrated with my predicament.

00:36:50.634 --> 00:36:53.094
"After all, it is very hard to

00:36:54.014 --> 00:36:58.354
"pursue any of the mind's intrigues

00:36:58.354 --> 00:37:03.333
"when you're confined and alone."

00:37:05.387 --> 00:37:09.012
LIAM: Well, you're somewhat in
the position you put yourself in.

00:37:09.012 --> 00:37:10.184
MATT: "Perhaps."

00:37:10.184 --> 00:37:14.194
LIAM: Why take the sabbatical from your mortal flesh

00:37:14.194 --> 00:37:15.227
in the first place?

00:37:17.204 --> 00:37:18.037
MATT: "Reasons.

00:37:21.204 --> 00:37:23.341
"But that's not what we're asking about right now."

00:37:23.341 --> 00:37:24.174
LIAM: No.

00:37:25.874 --> 00:37:27.487
MATT: "I wish to stretch a bit.

00:37:30.284 --> 00:37:32.954
"Return to the semblance of flesh

00:37:32.954 --> 00:37:34.657
"if even but for a moment.

00:37:38.194 --> 00:37:39.424
"I could answer these questions

00:37:39.424 --> 00:37:41.597
"for you in a more direct manner.

00:37:44.394 --> 00:37:45.894
"You just have to let me in."

00:37:48.684 --> 00:37:50.977
LIAM: Do you need my permission?

00:37:51.894 --> 00:37:54.077
MATT: "It certainly makes it easier."

00:38:01.444 --> 00:38:02.857
LIAM: Well, I tell you what.

00:38:06.704 --> 00:38:09.377
Let's keep it between you and me for three questions.

00:38:12.004 --> 00:38:14.534
And if I feel you've answered honestly for three

00:38:17.834 --> 00:38:21.535
we can see about another three in different circumstances.

00:38:23.314 --> 00:38:25.184
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

00:38:25.184 --> 00:38:27.434
LAURA: With advantage.

00:38:27.434 --> 00:38:30.227
MATT: Or deception, based on how you are coming at this.

00:38:31.864 --> 00:38:32.747
TRAVIS: Don't tell us.

00:38:35.404 --> 00:38:36.237
LIAM: It's the same.

00:38:37.724 --> 00:38:39.191
TRAVIS: Of course it is.

00:38:43.804 --> 00:38:45.335
LIAM: Two...

00:38:45.335 --> 00:38:46.802
natural 20s.

00:38:46.802 --> 00:38:48.294
MARISHA and ASHLEY: No way!

00:38:48.294 --> 00:38:50.594
MATT: Take a picture of that shit, that's amazing.

00:38:52.888 --> 00:38:55.444
TRAVIS: Wow!
LAURA: Yaas!

00:38:55.444 --> 00:38:58.567
TRAVIS: Legendary, rare.

00:38:58.567 --> 00:39:00.766
(laughter)

00:39:00.766 --> 00:39:02.249
TALIESIN: Oh wow.

00:39:03.249 --> 00:39:04.900
LIAM: (deep exhale) I need a cigarette.

00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:05.733
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:39:08.544 --> 00:39:10.014
LAURA: Are you texting-- text the whole group.

00:39:10.014 --> 00:39:11.095
I want to see it. Okay, good.

00:39:11.095 --> 00:39:14.024
TALIESIN: Just knowing that exists
in the universe is beautiful.

00:39:14.024 --> 00:39:15.084
ASHLEY: Feels good.

00:39:15.084 --> 00:39:16.764
LIAM: Somewhere back in campaign one,

00:39:16.764 --> 00:39:18.974
Vax is slinking away from Keyleth's room

00:39:18.974 --> 00:39:21.577
with his shoes in his hand past his sister's door.

00:39:22.634 --> 00:39:24.451
My friend, it gets better.

00:39:26.055 --> 00:39:27.694
LAURA and TRAVIS: Look at that.
ASHLEY: Wow.

00:39:27.694 --> 00:39:29.284
MATT: That's beautiful.

00:39:29.284 --> 00:39:31.258
LAURA: Ooh, and those dice are so pretty.

00:39:31.258 --> 00:39:34.091
TRAVIS: Why is it in the shape of a-- okay.

00:39:35.412 --> 00:39:36.853
LAURA: These are so pretty!

00:39:36.853 --> 00:39:38.269
LIAM: They're some of the newest.

00:39:41.894 --> 00:39:42.727
TRAVIS: Damn.

00:39:42.727 --> 00:39:46.984
MATT: You feel the presence in this gem,

00:39:46.984 --> 00:39:49.484
which began to become just the presence around you

00:39:50.944 --> 00:39:54.874
almost if it had a back foot, step onto it

00:39:54.874 --> 00:39:56.517
and meet you at equal ground.

00:40:05.184 --> 00:40:09.207
"I was a boy raised in the Zemniaz.

00:40:11.134 --> 00:40:12.606

"I quickly grew

00:40:31.874 --> 00:40:35.894
"beyond any interest in what it had have to offer

00:40:35.894 --> 00:40:38.464
"and absconded with all of my research materials

00:40:38.464 --> 00:40:42.294
"and the important things that my teachers

00:40:42.294 --> 00:40:44.544
"had imparted me with,

00:40:44.544 --> 00:40:49.374
"physical and otherwise, and began traveling the world to

00:40:51.074 --> 00:40:54.664
"acquire inspiration for building my own.

00:40:55.804 --> 00:40:59.604
"You found me in the beginning stages
of one such a construction.

00:40:59.604 --> 00:41:03.764
"Unfortunately, I could not finish it, yet.

00:41:06.614 --> 00:41:08.054
"Needless to say, in seeing the world,

00:41:08.054 --> 00:41:10.127
"I began to realize one continuous truth.

00:41:11.264 --> 00:41:15.044
"Everyone else is worthless.

00:41:15.044 --> 00:41:17.660

"So I decided to absolve myself of Exandria

00:41:29.474 --> 00:41:31.932
"and continue to build this home for myself.

00:41:33.968 --> 00:41:35.301
"That's where I'm from.

00:41:37.994 --> 00:41:40.857
"To answer your question about Aeor, well,

00:41:41.874 --> 00:41:44.624
"there are a handful of other cities

"that tried to rise to its grandeur.

"the most beautiful, the most successful.

"And the biggest tale of warning

"to those who would follow in its footsteps.

00:42:09.614 --> 00:42:10.447
"You see,

00:42:13.194 --> 00:42:16.997
"society is sick and destined to crumble.

00:42:18.604 --> 00:42:21.734
"There is an illusion to the idea of community

00:42:21.734 --> 00:42:23.789
"and working together.

00:42:25.624 --> 00:42:28.114
"Because every single time, it reaches a point

"where everyone tears each other apart.

"Or something on the outside

"sees the community as a threat and destroys it.

00:42:41.714 --> 00:42:42.814
"That happened to Aeor.

00:42:45.164 --> 00:42:47.544
"It suffered tumult within

00:42:49.284 --> 00:42:53.734
"and its lofty idealists had attempts to rise

"to the top of the divinity food chain

00:42:56.924 --> 00:43:00.684
"and prove their creators surpassed.

00:43:00.684 --> 00:43:03.184
"It drew the ire of the gods.

"And thus was smote.

"That's two questions.

"What is your third to continue this conversation?

00:43:35.534 --> 00:43:37.984
LIAM: What about the philosophers?

00:43:39.504 --> 00:43:41.195
The Somnovem.

00:43:42.162 --> 00:43:43.320
Do you know--

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:45.482
and I mean everything,

00:43:47.674 --> 00:43:49.604
who were they?

00:43:49.604 --> 00:43:50.687
What did they want?

00:43:51.574 --> 00:43:52.544
MATT: "I know of them.

00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:58.984
"There were a great many philosophers scattered about Aeor.

00:43:58.984 --> 00:44:03.007
"But the Somnovem, they were the strangest.

00:44:05.404 --> 00:44:08.884
"They felt, from what the records said,

00:44:10.544 --> 00:44:13.127
"like even they didn't belong within their own people.

00:44:17.002 --> 00:44:21.764
"It was a uniquely diverse spread of interests

00:44:21.764 --> 00:44:24.604
"that kept that city growing to its zenith.

00:44:25.471 --> 00:44:28.584
"But the Somnovem, for a society that didn't

00:44:28.584 --> 00:44:32.501
"ascribe to specific divinity,

00:44:34.351 --> 00:44:37.884
"seemed to have the closest to it than anyone.

00:44:37.884 --> 00:44:40.594
"An almost fanatical belief in the mortal imagination.

"An almost fanatical belief in the mortal imagination.

"And when they were challenged in their fanaticism,

"And when they were challenged in their fanaticism,

00:44:52.014 --> 00:44:55.564
"they closed themselves off from the rest of the society.

"An entire portion of the city

00:44:59.264 --> 00:45:02.457
"ostracized within its own construct.

"Socially, at least.

00:45:07.034 --> 00:45:11.727
"People were free to walk to and from, but why would they?

00:45:15.984 --> 00:45:17.884
"But it fell with the rest of the city.

"As all things do when they

"try to elicit the help of others."

LIAM: Is he fucking with me?

00:45:29.224 --> 00:45:30.404
MATT: Make a deception check.

00:45:30.404 --> 00:45:31.754
Or sorry, an insight check.

00:45:33.184 --> 00:45:34.134
LIAM: A lot of people did things to me;

00:45:34.134 --> 00:45:35.274
do I have advantage on this roll?

00:45:35.274 --> 00:45:37.174
MATT: Nope.
TALIESIN: Not on a check.

00:45:37.174 --> 00:45:38.804
Maybe advantage, or?

00:45:38.804 --> 00:45:40.054
LAURA: Did you Bless him?

00:45:40.054 --> 00:45:41.666
TALIESIN: Yeah, Bless is just saving throws.

00:45:41.666 --> 00:45:43.807
MATT: Yeah, so no, just the straight insight check.

00:45:44.844 --> 00:45:46.194
MARISHA: He might not know.

00:45:46.194 --> 00:45:47.957
LIAM: 19.
MATT: 19.

00:45:51.334 --> 00:45:52.497
He's,

00:45:57.244 --> 00:45:58.377
he's a survivor.

00:45:59.294 --> 00:46:02.034
So his speech is always carefully chosen,

00:46:02.034 --> 00:46:05.164
which makes it challenging to feel any shifts

00:46:06.064 --> 00:46:08.497
in intent or belief.

00:46:10.214 --> 00:46:11.664
You don't sense that he's

00:46:13.154 --> 00:46:15.464
telling an untruth by any means,

00:46:15.464 --> 00:46:16.667
but he's a slippery one.

00:46:17.614 --> 00:46:18.914
Who knows?

00:46:27.864 --> 00:46:30.547
LIAM: That is one question, but not all of the answer.

00:46:34.384 --> 00:46:36.797
Survivors after the fall.

00:46:40.874 --> 00:46:41.707
MATT: "Of Aeor?

00:46:43.164 --> 00:46:44.477
"There were no survivors.

00:46:46.654 --> 00:46:51.654
"They weren't attacked by some other competitive society.

00:46:51.724 --> 00:46:55.947
"They weren't taken down by some dangerous, legendary beast.

00:46:57.704 --> 00:47:01.664

"well, I don't know of them.

00:47:14.184 --> 00:47:18.244

LIAM: That's a good point.
Hold that thought.

00:47:40.844 --> 00:47:41.994
And I put the gem down.

00:47:45.154 --> 00:47:46.846
MATT: I need you to make a wisdom saving throw.

00:47:46.846 --> 00:47:48.671
TRAVIS: Oh, a saving throw.

00:47:49.584 --> 00:47:51.184
TALIESIN: Add a d4.
LAURA: Oh, yeah add a d4.

00:47:56.579 --> 00:47:59.612
LIAM: Oh, psh. Tss. (exhale)

00:47:59.612 --> 00:48:00.528
26.

00:48:02.043 --> 00:48:06.094
MATT: You are rolling up there tonight, jesus!

00:48:06.094 --> 00:48:07.274
TALIESIN: Lucky winner.

00:48:07.274 --> 00:48:08.527
MATT: As you are releasing the gem--

00:48:08.527 --> 00:48:09.577
TRAVIS: Eldritch Blast, no.

00:48:12.414 --> 00:48:14.420
SAM: He's acting weird, kill him.

00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:17.054
(laughter)
TRAVIS: [inaudible]

00:48:17.054 --> 00:48:19.170
(explosion)

00:48:19.170 --> 00:48:21.994
MATT: He just gets the Anna Ripley treatment.

00:48:21.994 --> 00:48:23.836
(laughter)

00:48:23.836 --> 00:48:25.444
TRAVIS: (impacts)

00:48:26.444 --> 00:48:28.534
MATT: As you are about to release the gem,

00:48:28.534 --> 00:48:30.492
your fingers feel tense and aren't listening to your flex.

00:48:30.492 --> 00:48:34.225
your fingers feel tense and aren't listening to your flex.

00:48:34.225 --> 00:48:37.124
And for a moment, you feel that same voice

00:48:38.214 --> 00:48:40.374
begin to press on your mind,

00:48:40.374 --> 00:48:43.097
like a sudden onset of a migraine.

00:48:44.534 --> 00:48:47.964
And you tense and close your eyelids tight

00:48:47.964 --> 00:48:51.534
and fight and will yourself to throw the gem from your hand.

00:48:51.534 --> 00:48:52.674
And as opposed to releasing it,

00:48:52.674 --> 00:48:54.761
you all watch as Caleb just throws it

00:48:54.761 --> 00:48:56.284
and it scatters across the ground

00:48:56.284 --> 00:48:58.994
about six, seven feet from him before coming to rest.

00:48:58.994 --> 00:49:00.755
SAM: Oh, I'll pick it up for you.

00:49:00.755 --> 00:49:02.971
Here, do you need it back?

00:49:03.989 --> 00:49:04.822
LAURA: Are you okay?

00:49:06.494 --> 00:49:07.327
LIAM: Yeah.

00:49:07.327 --> 00:49:09.184
LAURA: Are you you?

00:49:09.184 --> 00:49:10.017
LIAM: I am me.

00:49:11.814 --> 00:49:13.394
I am me.

00:49:13.394 --> 00:49:14.424
SAM: How can we be sure?

00:49:14.424 --> 00:49:15.584
LIAM: Eldritch Blaest.

00:49:15.584 --> 00:49:18.493
SAM: Okay, it's him.
TRAVIS: It's him. Yep, yep.

00:49:18.493 --> 00:49:19.326
It's him.

00:49:21.025 --> 00:49:25.634
LIAM: Ah, that's a slippery character.

00:49:25.634 --> 00:49:26.584
LAURA: What'd you learn?

00:49:28.726 --> 00:49:31.064
You had TV watching face the whole time.

00:49:31.064 --> 00:49:32.224
LIAM: I'll recount everything.

00:49:32.224 --> 00:49:34.274
TALIESIN: Can we, can we put ruby back in the--

00:49:34.274 --> 00:49:36.244
back in his pocket?

00:49:36.244 --> 00:49:37.314
TRAVIS: Ruby.

00:49:37.314 --> 00:49:39.418
MARISHA: Is that his nickname now, Ruby?

00:49:39.418 --> 00:49:40.844
LAURA: Yussa, can we put,

00:49:40.844 --> 00:49:43.144
can we put Ruby back where he came from?

00:49:43.144 --> 00:49:44.464
MATT: "If you're done, of course."

00:49:44.464 --> 00:49:45.732
SAM: Are we done with him?

00:49:45.732 --> 00:49:47.783
LIAM: Probably, probably.

00:49:49.164 --> 00:49:52.314
I kind of fucked with him a bit.

00:49:52.314 --> 00:49:55.524
He was expecting to have a little more conversation

00:49:55.524 --> 00:49:58.084
except he wanted to sit in my skin.

00:49:58.084 --> 00:50:00.934
So there is the potential to learn more.

00:50:00.934 --> 00:50:01.767
MARISHA: Creepy.

00:50:01.767 --> 00:50:03.924
LIAM: Seems like diminishing returns, though.

00:50:03.924 --> 00:50:05.584
LAURA: He's going to be super angry.

00:50:05.584 --> 00:50:06.417
LIAM: Yeah.

00:50:06.417 --> 00:50:07.804
LAURA: Yeah, no, let's put him away.

00:50:07.804 --> 00:50:12.424
SAM: Unless he was holding the best information for later?

00:50:12.424 --> 00:50:13.464
LIAM: Well, the interesting thing--

00:50:13.464 --> 00:50:15.854
the most interesting thing to me was when I asked

00:50:15.854 --> 00:50:19.514
about the philosophers and

00:50:20.397 --> 00:50:22.350
their continuing activity, he--

00:50:24.104 --> 00:50:27.474
he seemed to believe that they went down with the ship.

00:50:27.474 --> 00:50:29.394
SAM: As in were dead?

00:50:29.394 --> 00:50:31.319
LIAM: That they went down with Aeor.

00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:35.284
MARISHA: You said you recount-- you told us everything?

00:50:35.284 --> 00:50:38.024
LIAM: Yeah, I rattle it all off.

00:50:38.024 --> 00:50:40.354
SAM: Like their bodies are there?

00:50:40.354 --> 00:50:43.454
LIAM: The fact that this ward in the city survived

00:50:44.864 --> 00:50:46.464
and he's probably from

00:50:48.615 --> 00:50:52.944
a much shorter amount of time away from its fall and

00:50:54.404 --> 00:50:57.904
he believed that they have gone down with the city, so

00:51:00.354 --> 00:51:01.674
no one knows that this

00:51:03.004 --> 00:51:06.734
chunk of a metropolis survived in another realm.

00:51:06.734 --> 00:51:09.024
TRAVIS: We are the tip of the sword.

00:51:09.024 --> 00:51:09.904
LAURA: He said they were--

00:51:09.904 --> 00:51:13.721
they were the only people that believed in anything divine,

00:51:13.721 --> 00:51:15.337
kind of touched on it, right?

00:51:16.354 --> 00:51:18.374
LIAM: Wasn't it that they didn't care about the divine

00:51:18.374 --> 00:51:21.185
yet they were the closest to it because of their power?

00:51:21.185 --> 00:51:22.793
MATT: Correct.

00:51:22.793 --> 00:51:27.444
Fanaticism on a level that a divine fanatic would have,

00:51:27.444 --> 00:51:31.064
but instead of the divinity, it is a strong philosophy

00:51:31.064 --> 00:51:33.444
that they attribute so strongly to

00:51:33.444 --> 00:51:35.714
that it alienates the society around them.

00:51:35.714 --> 00:51:37.361
LAURA: Okay.

00:51:37.361 --> 00:51:39.394
LIAM: Little culty.
MATT: A little bit.

00:51:40.666 --> 00:51:43.524
LAURA: I wonder what the thing was that they--

00:51:44.454 --> 00:51:47.224
TALIESIN: Well, can you imagine someone of that much power,

00:51:47.224 --> 00:51:50.444
never hearing of a survivor of that city?

00:51:50.444 --> 00:51:52.574
That doesn't bode well.

00:51:52.574 --> 00:51:55.092
Maybe no one walked away.

00:51:55.092 --> 00:51:57.362
LAURA: Well, no, they all got teleported away.

00:51:57.362 --> 00:51:59.874
TALIESIN: Well, that group, but maybe nobody else.

00:51:59.874 --> 00:52:03.024
Maybe there really wasn't anybody

00:52:03.024 --> 00:52:03.941
who didn't--
LIAM: No one knows.

00:52:03.941 --> 00:52:06.524
LAURA: Well, there were some of those people frozen in time.

00:52:06.524 --> 00:52:08.304
TALIESIN: That might be everybody.

00:52:08.304 --> 00:52:11.001
MARISHA: Between the images of the beacon that Essek

00:52:11.001 --> 00:52:14.304
was talking about and now Halas talking about

00:52:14.304 --> 00:52:17.184
them being the closest to the divine

00:52:17.184 --> 00:52:20.357
without really ascribing to it,

00:52:21.424 --> 00:52:22.532
maybe all of this god smiting conversation is correct.

00:52:22.532 --> 00:52:27.064
maybe all of this god smiting conversation is correct.

00:52:27.064 --> 00:52:30.724
What if all those people are frozen

00:52:32.134 --> 00:52:35.827
and they did have a beacon and it went with them?

00:52:38.679 --> 00:52:41.474
TALIESIN: Like a corrupted beacon?

00:52:41.474 --> 00:52:42.464
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:52:42.464 --> 00:52:45.544
SAM: You mean it's holding their souls or something?

00:52:45.544 --> 00:52:47.444
LAURA: And that's what the Somnovem is now?

00:52:50.344 --> 00:52:51.384
MARISHA: I don't know.

00:52:51.384 --> 00:52:55.174
LIAM: Well, perhaps we are just grasping

00:52:55.174 --> 00:52:56.154
at straws in the dark here,

00:52:56.154 --> 00:52:57.644
but perhaps all of those people

00:52:57.644 --> 00:53:00.224
maybe it was a defense of the city?

00:53:00.224 --> 00:53:04.474
Or maybe all of those people were frozen and their

00:53:05.892 --> 00:53:07.544
essence, their souls were extracted.

00:53:07.544 --> 00:53:10.024
And now all, a city that size

00:53:10.024 --> 00:53:13.764
those millions of people now pulled from their bodies

00:53:13.764 --> 00:53:17.165
which are held like DeRogna in amber.

00:53:17.165 --> 00:53:18.627
MARISHA: Because if we're-- go ahead.

00:53:18.627 --> 00:53:21.744
TALIESIN: I was going to say,
I mean, maybe there were no gods.

00:53:21.744 --> 00:53:25.657
Maybe the Somnovem turned on them.

00:53:27.374 --> 00:53:30.739
I mean, if no one was really there, who knows what happened?

00:53:30.739 --> 00:53:33.272
LAURA: Oh, maybe the gods didn't smite them at all?

00:53:33.272 --> 00:53:34.105
TALIESIN: Maybe--

00:53:35.664 --> 00:53:37.324
MARISHA: The Dynasty--
TALIESIN: Or maybe I'm paranoid.

00:53:37.324 --> 00:53:38.214
I don't know.

00:53:38.214 --> 00:53:40.194
MARISHA: The Dynasty believes that their god

00:53:40.194 --> 00:53:43.597
was the creator of these beacons, but--

00:53:46.424 --> 00:53:47.534
TALIESIN: Maybe it was the Somnovem.

00:53:47.534 --> 00:53:48.747
MARISHA: Maybe, yeah.

00:53:50.064 --> 00:53:51.664
But the beacons have been found

00:53:51.664 --> 00:53:55.404
scattered all over Wildemount.

00:53:55.404 --> 00:53:59.384
SAM: Yeah, but when Aeor broke up or something

00:53:59.384 --> 00:54:02.884
and could have scattered them, scattered them across?

00:54:02.884 --> 00:54:04.084
LIAM: Perhaps it was a tech--

00:54:06.424 --> 00:54:09.344
some sort of technology of the time

00:54:09.344 --> 00:54:12.547
that was more prolific across the world?

00:54:13.444 --> 00:54:16.034
MATT: History check on Caleb and Beauregard.

00:54:16.034 --> 00:54:19.054
MARISHA: Yeah! Give me something good.

00:54:20.384 --> 00:54:22.309
TRAVIS: ♪ Give me something good. ♪

00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:24.327
LIAM: Am I still blessed?
MARISHA: I'll take it.

00:54:24.327 --> 00:54:26.112
LAURA: No, yes?

00:54:26.112 --> 00:54:27.824
MATT: It lasts for a minute, right?

00:54:27.824 --> 00:54:28.657
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, you're not.

00:54:28.657 --> 00:54:30.334
MATT: You are not.
LIAM: 29.

00:54:30.334 --> 00:54:31.495
TALIESIN: It would be a save, anyway, not a--

00:54:31.495 --> 00:54:32.461
LIAM: I rolled an 18.

00:54:32.461 --> 00:54:34.294
MARISHA: I also rolled an 18--

00:54:34.294 --> 00:54:35.444
MATT: You guys!

00:54:35.444 --> 00:54:36.484
MARISHA: Plus 14--

00:54:36.484 --> 00:54:38.334
LAURA: 18 plus 14?!

00:54:38.334 --> 00:54:40.174
MARISHA: Which is 28?

00:54:40.174 --> 00:54:41.694
TRAVIS: It's 32.
SAM: That's 32.

00:54:41.694 --> 00:54:43.509
ASHLEY: Jeez Louise.

00:54:43.509 --> 00:54:46.609
TALIESIN: Yeah.
LAURA: You have a plus 14?

00:54:46.609 --> 00:54:49.021
MARISHA: I have expertise in--
LIAM: Sherlock Holmes monk.

00:54:49.021 --> 00:54:51.374
MARISHA: I have expertise in like rogue shit and history.

00:54:51.374 --> 00:54:52.207
LIAM: Sherlock monk.

00:54:52.207 --> 00:54:54.797
LAURA: Anybody creating a character, remember: Monks.

00:54:55.924 --> 00:54:59.344
TALIESIN: No one liked you in high school did they?

00:54:59.344 --> 00:55:02.224
MARISHA: It's questionable.
TALIESIN: It's okay.

00:55:02.224 --> 00:55:04.667
MATT: Okay, you do recall that the--

00:55:05.544 --> 00:55:07.834
in learning a bit about the Dynasty and the history

00:55:07.834 --> 00:55:11.054
of the Kryn and Leylas, the first to find the beacon

00:55:11.054 --> 00:55:13.404
and really connect to Luxon.

00:55:13.404 --> 00:55:18.304
That was found deep in the Underdark beneath Ghor Dranas.

00:55:18.304 --> 00:55:21.404
And other beacons have been found in other spaces

00:55:21.404 --> 00:55:23.514
but it's been, they've been scattered throughout.

00:55:23.514 --> 00:55:26.204
Their theory is that many beacons exist

00:55:26.204 --> 00:55:30.304
all across Exandria and different places in the world.

00:55:30.304 --> 00:55:33.364
And they're all parts of the Luxon that once broke up

00:55:33.364 --> 00:55:36.264
its physical self to essentially

00:55:37.144 --> 00:55:41.554
eventually draw its people together through time

00:55:41.554 --> 00:55:43.794
to bring it back to its original form

00:55:43.794 --> 00:55:45.984
and help it understand itself.

00:55:45.984 --> 00:55:48.644
And, in doing so, also help people in that process

00:55:48.644 --> 00:55:50.294
understand what their purpose is

00:55:50.294 --> 00:55:53.384
and become umavi, perfect souls.

00:55:53.384 --> 00:55:54.217
MARISHA: Right.

00:55:57.539 --> 00:55:58.984
MATT: Since there is no history

00:55:58.984 --> 00:56:01.444
of any beacons, any Luxon beacons

00:56:01.444 --> 00:56:04.634
before the existence of the Dynasty

00:56:06.184 --> 00:56:10.304
being found at least knowingly in the open-world history,

00:56:10.304 --> 00:56:11.974
the Dynasty very much believes

00:56:11.974 --> 00:56:14.784
that they are the beginning of a beacon's existence.

00:56:14.784 --> 00:56:17.014
But it is very possible that other people have found them

00:56:17.014 --> 00:56:18.584
and just don't understand them.

00:56:18.584 --> 00:56:21.694
Or they're still just lost throughout time.

00:56:21.694 --> 00:56:26.124
Or any other theories you may have, but just,

00:56:26.124 --> 00:56:28.684
helping clarify the information that you both would have

00:56:28.684 --> 00:56:31.524
from your time studying in the Dynasty that

00:56:31.524 --> 00:56:34.684
the beacons that were found by the Dynasty were found

00:56:34.684 --> 00:56:36.334
in all different types of topography

00:56:36.334 --> 00:56:39.224
and some deep, deep beneath the surface of the world.

00:56:39.224 --> 00:56:41.234
MARISHA: So probably not scattered

00:56:41.234 --> 00:56:43.724
from Aeor is what you're saying.

00:56:43.724 --> 00:56:46.004
MATT: Less likely than so.

00:56:46.004 --> 00:56:48.924
LIAM: Maybe a god sneezed and they sprayed from their nose

00:56:49.804 --> 00:56:51.144
all across world.

00:56:51.144 --> 00:56:52.152
LAURA: Sneezes send out--

00:56:52.152 --> 00:56:53.884
SAM: Got to wear a mask.

00:56:53.884 --> 00:56:55.917
LIAM: Wear a mask, please, when you're out and about.

00:56:55.917 --> 00:56:57.744
TRAVIS: So what now?

00:56:57.744 --> 00:56:59.117
We've asked our questions.

00:57:00.444 --> 00:57:01.854
LIAM: I think we've gotten as much

00:57:01.854 --> 00:57:06.177
as is safe and warranted from Mr. Halas.

00:57:06.177 --> 00:57:08.274
MATT: Yussa's Mage Hand plucks the ruby from the ground

00:57:08.274 --> 00:57:09.784
and lifts it up into the center of the chamber

00:57:09.784 --> 00:57:12.764
between you all facing each other and says,

00:57:12.764 --> 00:57:14.344
"And are you finished with your inquiry?"

00:57:14.344 --> 00:57:15.287
MARISHA: I almost--

00:57:16.471 --> 00:57:18.994
this is kind of Marisha saying this,

00:57:18.994 --> 00:57:21.354
wish we could weaponize this.

00:57:21.354 --> 00:57:24.194
Like, hey Lucien, hold this stone.

00:57:24.194 --> 00:57:25.274
I don't know.

00:57:25.274 --> 00:57:26.294
SAM: Sure.

00:57:26.294 --> 00:57:28.894
TRAVIS: Well, that would go probably just as poorly for us.

00:57:28.894 --> 00:57:31.834
TALIESIN: I think if anything that would be--

00:57:31.834 --> 00:57:34.397
MATT: Just give Halas the powers of the Nonagon.

00:57:34.397 --> 00:57:38.630
TRAVIS: Upgrade Lucien. What the fuck are you talking about?

00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:40.454
MARISHA: No, like--
MATT: I see what you're saying.

00:57:40.454 --> 00:57:43.803
LAURA: It seems like lot of fun.
MARISHA: But don't I think we can.

00:57:43.803 --> 00:57:44.795
MATT: I see what you're saying.

00:57:44.795 --> 00:57:49.590
TALIESIN: I think putting Voldemort in Skeletor
is not necessarily the best.

00:57:49.590 --> 00:57:51.140
I don't know, I could be wrong.

00:57:53.352 --> 00:57:54.534
MARISHA: You know, it's like putting

00:57:54.534 --> 00:57:56.139
two kaijus against each other.

00:57:56.139 --> 00:57:57.197
TALIESIN: Let them fight?
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:57:57.197 --> 00:57:59.264
MATT: I see what you're saying, I see what you're saying.

00:57:59.264 --> 00:58:00.294
MARISHA: I'm not suggesting this,

00:58:00.294 --> 00:58:02.597
which is why I said, "Marisha is saying this."

00:58:03.886 --> 00:58:06.036
Specifically.
LIAM: Now we need to get through Halas,

00:58:06.036 --> 00:58:07.136
then through Lucien,

00:58:07.136 --> 00:58:08.594
and then somewhere under all of that

00:58:08.594 --> 00:58:10.521
is Molly somewhere hiding.

00:58:10.521 --> 00:58:11.911
TRAVIS: Right.

00:58:11.911 --> 00:58:14.034
LIAM: Molly, Molly, can you hear me, Molly?

00:58:14.034 --> 00:58:16.074
Do you want the moon, Molly?

00:58:16.074 --> 00:58:17.874
TRAVIS: We are done with our questions, but

00:58:19.284 --> 00:58:20.894
it might serve us well if we were able

00:58:20.894 --> 00:58:23.457
to speak with your friend, Allura.

00:58:25.624 --> 00:58:27.327
MATT: "Very well, I can arrange that.

00:58:28.424 --> 00:58:30.844
"But first," and once again pulls his finger across.

00:58:30.844 --> 00:58:33.114
The opening opens once more, but it's more

00:58:33.114 --> 00:58:34.684
it's tilted now closer to your position

00:58:34.684 --> 00:58:35.694
you can see on the inside,

00:58:35.694 --> 00:58:39.454
there's this swirl of purple energy that gives this

00:58:39.454 --> 00:58:41.164
the stasic space and on the up inside,

00:58:41.164 --> 00:58:42.884
you can see other strange objects that are just

00:58:42.884 --> 00:58:44.534
held aloft very briefly

00:58:44.534 --> 00:58:46.734
before he throws the gem in with his Mage Hand

00:58:46.734 --> 00:58:48.474
and seals it shut once more.

00:58:48.474 --> 00:58:50.394
LAURA: How much do you keep in there?

00:58:50.394 --> 00:58:51.227
MATT: "Enough.

00:58:53.267 --> 00:58:54.317
"Nevertheless."

00:58:54.317 --> 00:58:56.144
TALIESIN: There's a practical matter.

00:58:56.144 --> 00:58:56.977
TRAVIS: Yes?
SAM: What's that?

00:58:56.977 --> 00:59:00.634
TALIESIN: So let's say that we were way up north

00:59:00.634 --> 00:59:03.654
and we tried to teleport something here

00:59:03.654 --> 00:59:04.984
or technically not here,

00:59:04.984 --> 00:59:08.494
but teleport something really far away.

00:59:08.494 --> 00:59:11.004
And it may not have actually gotten

00:59:11.954 --> 00:59:14.474
to where we were teleporting it because--

00:59:14.474 --> 00:59:15.854
MATT: "Based on our previous conversation,

00:59:15.854 --> 00:59:18.734
"I assume this deals with the interference

00:59:18.734 --> 00:59:20.264
"of Aeor and Eiselcross?"

00:59:20.264 --> 00:59:21.689
TALIESIN: You're good, yes.

00:59:22.584 --> 00:59:24.044
MATT: "It can go any number of ways.

00:59:24.044 --> 00:59:27.624
"Your best bet is to inquire as to

00:59:27.624 --> 00:59:30.968
"where it might be through
scrying means and other magical--"

00:59:30.968 --> 00:59:34.354
LAURA: I can't scry on an object, though.

00:59:34.354 --> 00:59:35.904
MARISHA: We haven't checked in with the Soul yet

00:59:35.904 --> 00:59:37.919
to see if they actually got it.
LAURA: I know, I can totally do that

00:59:37.919 --> 00:59:39.973
after we're done here.

00:59:39.973 --> 00:59:42.374
MATT: "I can see what I can--"

00:59:42.374 --> 00:59:44.664
LAURA: You have the ability to scry on an object?

00:59:44.664 --> 00:59:46.627
MATT: "Well, it's more of a--

00:59:48.060 --> 00:59:49.354
"come with me."

00:59:49.354 --> 00:59:53.164
And he leads you all past the blue velvet curtain

00:59:53.164 --> 00:59:56.224
which leads to the exterior of the room

00:59:56.224 --> 00:59:58.424
and the size of this tower is about the width of Tide Peak.

00:59:58.424 --> 01:00:00.434
And as you go through the curtain

01:00:00.434 --> 01:00:01.874
it leads into a stairwell.

01:00:01.874 --> 01:00:02.981
Like a spiral staircase that--

01:00:02.981 --> 01:00:05.173
LIAM: Are we going into the adult section?

01:00:05.173 --> 01:00:06.006
TRAVIS: Right?

01:00:06.975 --> 01:00:08.394
This is the back of the comic book store.

01:00:08.394 --> 01:00:09.919
TALIESIN: We're going to the Red Room in Twin Peaks.
MATT: There's a

01:00:09.919 --> 01:00:11.435
balding, heavier, bearded man

01:00:11.435 --> 01:00:13.515
behind the counter there that goes like, "Go ahead."

01:00:13.515 --> 01:00:16.931
(laughter)

01:00:18.104 --> 01:00:19.134
But it's all, like, 70s porn,

01:00:19.134 --> 01:00:20.394
everyone's got big mustaches.

01:00:20.394 --> 01:00:23.191
TRAVIS: That's okay, doesn't matter.
ALL: Eyy!

01:00:24.044 --> 01:00:27.644
MATT: So heading up the spiral staircase, you head into

01:00:27.644 --> 01:00:29.704
there's three more doorways on the platform above

01:00:29.704 --> 01:00:30.864
and he just goes to the right one.

01:00:30.864 --> 01:00:32.544
As he walks up towards, it opens on its own

01:00:32.544 --> 01:00:35.074
and he leads you in and there's a similar chamber

01:00:35.074 --> 01:00:38.764
to the arrival teleportation room

01:00:38.764 --> 01:00:42.044
that you are used to coming to and from within here,

01:00:42.044 --> 01:00:44.104
similar design, though it is a bit smaller.

01:00:44.104 --> 01:00:48.634
In the middle, there are these
odd, brass, shiny instruments.

01:00:48.634 --> 01:00:50.624
These tripod-like structures

01:00:50.624 --> 01:00:52.244
that all point towards a center piece.

01:00:52.244 --> 01:00:53.964
They have crystals in them.

01:00:53.964 --> 01:00:55.494
They stand about four feet tall or so,

01:00:55.494 --> 01:00:57.354
and there's three of them facing inward.

01:00:57.354 --> 01:00:59.454
And in the center, you can see a small,

01:00:59.454 --> 01:01:01.989
foot and a half tall platform.

01:01:02.938 --> 01:01:06.514
Yussa says, "If you are to attempt to

01:01:07.704 --> 01:01:10.554
"scry within this chamber--

01:01:10.554 --> 01:01:13.804
"Do you have, do you have any sort of--

01:01:16.094 --> 01:01:17.034
"I guess you wouldn't have anything

01:01:17.034 --> 01:01:18.789
from the object, would you?"

01:01:20.728 --> 01:01:23.321
SAM: Did we keep the bag? No.

01:01:23.321 --> 01:01:27.304
LAURA: I mean, I still have the bag it was in.

01:01:27.304 --> 01:01:29.362
SAM: Wasn't there anything else in the bag?

01:01:29.362 --> 01:01:31.322
LAURA: I mean, nothing that belonged to the--

01:01:31.322 --> 01:01:32.155
MATT: "We can try."

01:01:32.155 --> 01:01:33.900
SAM: But we have the thing it was in.

01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:35.969
LIAM: The only thing I can think of is

01:01:35.969 --> 01:01:39.439
before we sent it away, I smeared a bit of molasses on it.

01:01:39.439 --> 01:01:42.725
LAURA: And it had Beau's fabric wrapped around it, too.

01:01:42.725 --> 01:01:43.558
LIAM: No, I kept that.

01:01:43.558 --> 01:01:44.669
MARISHA: He burned it.

01:01:44.669 --> 01:01:46.319
LIAM: I used that for the-- no, I didn't burn it.

01:01:46.319 --> 01:01:47.964
MATT: "But you do have this molasses

01:01:47.964 --> 01:01:49.318
"or any more of this molasses

01:01:49.318 --> 01:01:50.376
"that you utilized?"
LIAM: Yes, I do.

01:01:50.376 --> 01:01:52.113
I pull it out of my components.

01:01:52.113 --> 01:01:53.487
MATT: He takes it swiftly and sets it

01:01:53.487 --> 01:01:56.453
on the same platform there.

01:01:56.453 --> 01:01:59.477
"I do not have any personal experience with this object,

01:01:59.477 --> 01:02:01.842
"this crest, but you do.

01:02:01.842 --> 01:02:04.991
"If you would like to use this as a focus, I warn you

01:02:04.991 --> 01:02:07.910
"it is strenuous to attempt to push

01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:10.219
"beyond the boundaries of such a spell.

01:02:10.219 --> 01:02:13.002
"So it may be painful."

01:02:14.657 --> 01:02:17.455
TALIESIN: Would an image help? I don't know.

01:02:17.455 --> 01:02:19.177
Can anyone do that right now?

01:02:19.177 --> 01:02:21.360
MATT: You recognize, Caduceus, looking in this chamber,

01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:25.027
at the edge of these three tripod-like devices,

01:02:25.027 --> 01:02:28.337
the gem that's put at the end has

01:02:28.337 --> 01:02:31.801
a deep green coloration that you recall

01:02:31.801 --> 01:02:35.319
very similar material to what you procured

01:02:35.319 --> 01:02:38.079
when you were making your way into the--

01:02:38.079 --> 01:02:39.253
LAURA and MARISHA: ♪ Making your way ♪

01:02:39.253 --> 01:02:40.528
MATT: -- Greying Wildlands.

01:02:41.958 --> 01:02:43.201
Residuum.

01:02:43.201 --> 01:02:44.645
TRAVIS: That was, like, two-part harmony.

01:02:44.645 --> 01:02:45.919
TALIESIN: On all three of these?

01:02:45.919 --> 01:02:48.254
MATT: All three of them at the end points have residuum

01:02:48.254 --> 01:02:51.108
facing inward as a magical focus.

01:02:51.108 --> 01:02:52.775
TALIESIN: So this is like a--

01:02:54.097 --> 01:02:56.200
I actually still have some residuum on me.

01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:57.573
MATT: "This is an amplification chamber."

01:02:57.573 --> 01:02:59.730
LAURA: (gasps) Ooh!

01:02:59.730 --> 01:03:01.786
I mean, I could just message somebody about it,

01:03:01.786 --> 01:03:03.619
but this seems like way more fun.

01:03:03.619 --> 01:03:05.575
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: He turns to you and says,

01:03:05.575 --> 01:03:07.442
"I assume you don't mean telling other people

01:03:07.442 --> 01:03:08.654
"about this chamber, do you?"

01:03:08.654 --> 01:03:09.750
LAURA: No, no, no.

01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:11.103
MATT: "Do not tell anyone about this chamber."

01:03:11.103 --> 01:03:14.637
LAURA: No, I mean, I already
tweeted about it, but it's fine.

01:03:14.637 --> 01:03:16.373
LIAM: It is the adult section.

01:03:16.373 --> 01:03:17.461
MATT: "There is a semblance of trust

01:03:17.461 --> 01:03:20.544
"in me even showing you this interior.

01:03:20.544 --> 01:03:24.287
"Such chambers are not smiled upon in some circles."

01:03:24.287 --> 01:03:25.757
TRAVIS: Your trust is appreciated.

01:03:25.757 --> 01:03:28.804
SAM: We never talk about you to anyone.

01:03:28.804 --> 01:03:31.446
And even if we did, no one believes us about anything.

01:03:31.446 --> 01:03:33.163
TALIESIN: That's true.
MATT: "Good."

01:03:34.267 --> 01:03:35.762
TALIESIN: I don't have Locate Object right now.

01:03:35.762 --> 01:03:38.114
Do you have Locate Object?

01:03:38.114 --> 01:03:40.597
LAURA: Oh, not Locate Object. I have Scry.

01:03:40.597 --> 01:03:42.170
MATT: "Either of those may suffice."

01:03:42.170 --> 01:03:43.253
LAURA: Okay, cool.

01:03:44.254 --> 01:03:45.697
Actually, maybe I have Locate Object.

01:03:45.697 --> 01:03:47.994
That's a lower spell.

01:03:47.994 --> 01:03:49.094
Whatever.

01:03:50.933 --> 01:03:53.726
TALIESIN: Does this burn the residuum when you use it?

01:03:53.726 --> 01:03:54.767
LAURA: Oh, I have Locate Object,

01:03:54.767 --> 01:03:55.600
that's a better spell to use.

01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:57.227
I'm going to use Locate Object.

01:03:57.227 --> 01:03:58.191
MATT: "Not entirely.

01:03:58.191 --> 01:03:59.926
"It does eventually wear away, but--"

01:03:59.926 --> 01:04:00.871
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:04:00.871 --> 01:04:02.392
TALIESIN: This is really cool.

01:04:02.392 --> 01:04:03.495
MATT: "Thank you."

01:04:03.495 --> 01:04:04.640
LAURA: Should I sit down?

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:07.591
Should I like-- what should I do?

01:04:07.591 --> 01:04:12.077
MATT: "Use this as the focal point in your ritual circle."

01:04:12.077 --> 01:04:14.137
LAURA: Right, my ritual circle.
MATT: "Yes."

01:04:14.137 --> 01:04:17.459
LAURA: Very important part of any spellcasting

01:04:17.459 --> 01:04:20.566
is your ritual circle.

01:04:20.566 --> 01:04:22.590
LIAM: I hand Jester a piece of chalk.

01:04:22.590 --> 01:04:25.568
LAURA: Thank you so much, Caleb.

01:04:25.568 --> 01:04:30.540
TALIESIN: Do you want some guidance, or?
LAURA: Us fellow magic part-- practitioners.

01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:33.888
MATT: As you begin drawing the circle

01:04:33.888 --> 01:04:37.047
in a very freeform jazz,

01:04:37.047 --> 01:04:39.194
improvisational way, it looks less like

01:04:39.194 --> 01:04:42.688
a beautiful runic circle and more like what, Jester?

01:04:42.688 --> 01:04:43.563
LAURA: Dicks!

01:04:43.563 --> 01:04:44.766
(laughter)

01:04:44.766 --> 01:04:47.417
MATT: Just a mandala of dicks.

01:04:47.417 --> 01:04:49.855
Like a-- (laughs)

01:04:49.855 --> 01:04:53.040
Like an odd chapel roof
SAM: Man-dala.

01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:55.156
LAURA: (laughs) "Man-dala."

01:04:55.156 --> 01:04:56.843
MATT: Goddamn it.

01:04:56.843 --> 01:04:58.173
TALIESIN: Don't search it.
LAURA: But I'm going to, you know,

01:04:58.173 --> 01:05:00.516
I'm going to also draw the beacon.

01:05:00.516 --> 01:05:02.037
It's the beacon

01:05:02.037 --> 01:05:03.929
with a lot of dicks coming out of it,

01:05:03.929 --> 01:05:04.888
you know what I mean?

01:05:04.888 --> 01:05:07.353
MATT: You all watch as she gets closer to completing it

01:05:07.353 --> 01:05:09.529
Yussa glances forward over her shoulder.

01:05:09.529 --> 01:05:14.279
His head turns to the side to an almost impossible angle

01:05:15.571 --> 01:05:17.858
and then snaps back up and he steps back.

01:05:17.858 --> 01:05:18.875
TALIESIN: It's her way.

01:05:18.875 --> 01:05:20.104
LAURA: Thank you, Caleb.

01:05:20.104 --> 01:05:20.937
MARISHA: It's her way.

01:05:20.937 --> 01:05:22.587
TALIESIN: I'm going to give you some Guidance

01:05:22.587 --> 01:05:23.420
before we do this.

01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:25.027
LAURA: Thanks.

01:05:25.027 --> 01:05:26.405
Okay, ready.

01:05:26.405 --> 01:05:28.323
MATT: As you begin the ritual,

01:05:28.323 --> 01:05:29.833
and begin to focus.

01:05:29.833 --> 01:05:31.237
You hear the voice,

01:05:31.237 --> 01:05:34.108
the familiar voice of the Traveler, Artagan

01:05:34.108 --> 01:05:35.382
come into your ear and go,

01:05:35.382 --> 01:05:38.057
"Ooh, what is this strange arrangement?

01:05:38.057 --> 01:05:39.327
"Tickles."

01:05:39.327 --> 01:05:41.856
You all watch as the green gems on the edge

01:05:41.856 --> 01:05:45.107
of these begin to glow as her magic begins to focus.

01:05:45.107 --> 01:05:46.977
And as you put your hands out on the outside

01:05:46.977 --> 01:05:50.028
of this little platform that contains the molasses

01:05:50.028 --> 01:05:55.028
that you're focusing on, great arcane focal energy here,

01:05:55.345 --> 01:05:58.526
your eyes flicker open with a similar green coloration

01:05:58.526 --> 01:06:00.897
as the residuum shards.

01:06:00.897 --> 01:06:03.047
I need you to go ahead and make

01:06:03.047 --> 01:06:04.426
a wisdom saving throw for me.

01:06:04.426 --> 01:06:07.022
LAURA: A wisdom saving throw?!
MATT: Yes.

01:06:07.022 --> 01:06:08.722
TALIESIN: Burned it all. Darn.

01:06:12.025 --> 01:06:13.500
LAURA: With my d4.

01:06:14.461 --> 01:06:15.461
LIAM: d4.

01:06:18.776 --> 01:06:19.609
LAURA: 28.

01:06:19.609 --> 01:06:20.467
SAM: Whoa!

01:06:20.467 --> 01:06:21.300
MATT: 28.

01:06:21.300 --> 01:06:22.509
SAM: These rolls!
LIAM: Crushing it.

01:06:22.509 --> 01:06:25.261
MATT: You guys are--
SAM: These rolls!

01:06:25.261 --> 01:06:27.156
SAM: Ever since that book.
MARISHA: Ever since that extra level.

01:06:27.156 --> 01:06:29.335
Made all the difference.

01:06:29.335 --> 01:06:31.513
TALIESIN: No d4 for me on that one, by the way.

01:06:31.513 --> 01:06:32.654
MATT: No.
LAURA: Oh.

01:06:32.654 --> 01:06:33.917
MATT: Oh, did you roll a d4 on that one?

01:06:33.917 --> 01:06:36.161
LAURA: I did, but that means it's a 25.

01:06:36.161 --> 01:06:37.952
TALIESIN: Okay.
LIAM: Terrible.

01:06:37.952 --> 01:06:40.243
TALIESIN: Mine's an ability check.
LAURA: Ah.

01:06:40.243 --> 01:06:43.503
MATT: You feel the stress

01:06:43.503 --> 01:06:46.104
shoot through your shoulders and the back of your neck

01:06:46.104 --> 01:06:50.257
like you've been lifting for days

01:06:50.257 --> 01:06:52.375
and all the muscles have knotted up

01:06:52.375 --> 01:06:55.678
and have locked and that pressure

01:06:55.678 --> 01:06:57.404
begins to push into your sinuses and you feel

01:06:57.404 --> 01:07:00.402
like your nose is just about to burst forth with blood.

01:07:00.402 --> 01:07:03.486
You just have this terrible force,

01:07:03.486 --> 01:07:04.984
like you've just (grunting)

01:07:04.984 --> 01:07:07.467
been stressing your face to the point
where it turns beet red

01:07:07.467 --> 01:07:10.884
and you're about to just blow every vessel in your face.

01:07:10.884 --> 01:07:12.825
SAM: You poopin'?
LAURA: You pooping?

01:07:12.825 --> 01:07:15.250
MATT: But you push through the poopin'.

01:07:17.572 --> 01:07:18.822
Now there is a,

01:07:20.028 --> 01:07:22.667
there is a soft focal gliding to a lot

01:07:22.667 --> 01:07:25.126
of your scrying attempts that you're used to in the past.

01:07:25.126 --> 01:07:28.520
This feels jagged and buffeted by invisible winds.

01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:30.253
You're getting glimpses and you feel like you're being

01:07:30.253 --> 01:07:32.376
slammed from side to side and pulled forward.

01:07:32.376 --> 01:07:36.329
It's like being drawn down the white rapids

01:07:36.329 --> 01:07:37.878
with a barely a raft.

01:07:37.878 --> 01:07:39.469
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:07:39.469 --> 01:07:40.741
SAM: Are you still talking about poos?

01:07:40.741 --> 01:07:42.444
TRAVIS: This is all pooping imagery-appropriate.

01:07:42.444 --> 01:07:44.540
MATT: No, I'm talking about the scry spell!

01:07:44.540 --> 01:07:47.228
TRAVIS: It's like gliding, the wind buffeting your face,

01:07:47.228 --> 01:07:49.163
the white rapids.

01:07:49.163 --> 01:07:51.184
LAURA: I wasn't listening to any poop reference, Matt.

01:07:51.184 --> 01:07:53.034
I was listening to your description.

01:07:53.034 --> 01:07:55.234
TALIESIN: She was fine.
TRAVIS: You were three for three, man.

01:07:55.234 --> 01:07:56.739
LIAM: We were thinking of lower intestines.

01:07:56.739 --> 01:07:57.867
TRAVIS: There's a porcelain kingdom.

01:07:57.867 --> 01:07:59.108
MARISHA: Jagged edges.

01:08:00.451 --> 01:08:01.839
LIAM: Yeah.

01:08:01.839 --> 01:08:03.022
Ooh!
ASHLEY: Ow!

01:08:03.022 --> 01:08:04.941
LIAM: Had that peanut snack.

01:08:04.941 --> 01:08:06.932
TRAVIS: No, don't write it down, don't write anything down!

01:08:06.932 --> 01:08:08.531
MATT: What? I didn't write anything.

01:08:08.531 --> 01:08:11.429
SAM: The feeling is just splattering forth.

01:08:12.437 --> 01:08:13.854
MATT: A warm release.

01:08:17.097 --> 01:08:21.170
As you're being tossed through the storm,

01:08:21.170 --> 01:08:23.989
you eventually find yourself coming to rest

01:08:23.989 --> 01:08:26.816
aggressively into a space.

01:08:26.816 --> 01:08:29.777
You don't hit the ground, but you feel an impact

01:08:29.777 --> 01:08:30.860
like a weird,

01:08:32.032 --> 01:08:33.148
it's hard to explain.

01:08:33.148 --> 01:08:35.956
It's like being thrown a very hard into a blanket.

01:08:35.956 --> 01:08:37.498
It still hurts,

01:08:37.498 --> 01:08:39.949
though it's slightly cushioned.

01:08:39.949 --> 01:08:41.715
And there you see yourself in the middle

01:08:41.715 --> 01:08:45.511
of a dense, dark forest.

01:08:45.511 --> 01:08:47.856
Thick trees everywhere.

01:08:47.856 --> 01:08:49.096
LIAM: (high-pitched) What?!

01:08:49.096 --> 01:08:51.471
MATT: A faint bit of snow drifts from above

01:08:51.471 --> 01:08:53.807
and white tops.

01:08:53.807 --> 01:08:55.676
The top of the forest elements of it drift down,

01:08:55.676 --> 01:08:58.364
but largely it's relatively fresh.

01:08:58.364 --> 01:09:03.364
And looking around you, it is gray, it is day.

01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:06.866
You see dense foliage,

01:09:06.866 --> 01:09:09.415
and there on the ground,
in the midst of this space,

01:09:09.415 --> 01:09:13.999
you see a large, faintly glowing, blue stone.

01:09:13.999 --> 01:09:16.947
LIAM: Is there a winter forest in your library?

01:09:16.947 --> 01:09:18.506
MARISHA: I don't think so.
LIAM: Okay.

01:09:18.506 --> 01:09:20.772
MARISHA: There's one not far from Rexxentrum.

01:09:20.772 --> 01:09:21.605
There is--

01:09:21.605 --> 01:09:22.897
LAURA: Can I look around?

01:09:22.897 --> 01:09:24.636
Do I see any flowers growing?

01:09:24.636 --> 01:09:26.866
Do I see any fruit on the ground?

01:09:26.866 --> 01:09:28.643
MATT: Make a perception check with disadvantage.

01:09:28.643 --> 01:09:31.048
TRAVIS: Did we get it out of--

01:09:31.048 --> 01:09:32.520
MATT: Because right now your vision is, like,

01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:33.834
it's like going through a bad TV.

01:09:33.834 --> 01:09:36.383
You're looking and it's (sparking).

01:09:36.383 --> 01:09:38.308
You're pushing beyond what you're supposed to be able to do.

01:09:38.308 --> 01:09:39.219
LIAM: Yeah, yeah.

01:09:39.219 --> 01:09:40.238
MARISHA: But it's in the woods.

01:09:40.238 --> 01:09:41.877
LIAM: That's the climate of Rexxentrum, right.

01:09:41.877 --> 01:09:43.941
I thought maybe we'd be three blocks from the library,

01:09:43.941 --> 01:09:47.334
but we're three miles away from the city.

01:09:47.334 --> 01:09:48.798
LAURA: Nine!

01:09:48.798 --> 01:09:50.980
MATT: It's hard to see and your eyes are starting to blur.

01:09:50.980 --> 01:09:53.372
Your vision is actually having a hard time focusing.

01:09:53.372 --> 01:09:54.795
Where you arrived, it was pretty clear,

01:09:54.795 --> 01:09:56.378
but the more time you spend focusing in this spot,

01:09:56.378 --> 01:09:58.831
it's like starting to blur and pulse

01:09:58.831 --> 01:10:01.208
and you're starting to lose your tenuous hold

01:10:01.208 --> 01:10:03.646
on this location with your magic.

01:10:03.646 --> 01:10:05.086
The good news is, this does not appear

01:10:05.086 --> 01:10:07.232
to be anywhere near Eiselcross.
LAURA: That's good.

01:10:07.232 --> 01:10:09.717
MATT: Bad news is,
who knows where it is.

01:10:09.717 --> 01:10:11.305
LAURA and TRAVIS: Wow.

01:10:11.305 --> 01:10:12.998
MATT: And with that, you lose your tether,

01:10:12.998 --> 01:10:14.591
you're zapped back through

01:10:14.591 --> 01:10:16.731
and then back in the room.

01:10:16.731 --> 01:10:19.758
LAURA: I check the ground to
make sure I didn't poop on myself.

01:10:19.758 --> 01:10:21.387
MATT: Make an investigation check.

01:10:22.570 --> 01:10:23.632
LAURA: Natural 20!

01:10:23.632 --> 01:10:24.471
MATT: Nice!

01:10:24.471 --> 01:10:28.310
(laughter)

01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:31.250
You're confident that though you may have tooted a little--

01:10:31.250 --> 01:10:33.000
TRAVIS: Fucking ridiculous.

01:10:34.248 --> 01:10:35.446
MATT: Nothing left behind. You're good.

01:10:35.446 --> 01:10:37.821
LIAM: Right on the line.

01:10:37.821 --> 01:10:39.202
MATT: As Jester looks up to the rest of you,

01:10:39.202 --> 01:10:40.691
you notice there is a trickle of red

01:10:40.691 --> 01:10:42.542
coming down from the right nostril.

01:10:42.542 --> 01:10:44.544
SAM: Jester!
LIAM: Are you all right?

01:10:44.544 --> 01:10:45.888
LAURA: Oh yeah, I'm fine.

01:10:45.888 --> 01:10:49.128
You guys, Caleb, it did not go.

01:10:49.128 --> 01:10:51.527
It did not go to the library.

01:10:51.527 --> 01:10:53.383
MARISHA: Oh no.
TRAVIS: Where did it go?

01:10:53.383 --> 01:10:54.677
LAURA: I don't know. It was in the middle of a forest.

01:10:54.677 --> 01:10:56.200
It was snowing.

01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:58.259
Didn't look like Eiselcross.

01:10:58.259 --> 01:10:59.803
LIAM: Was it a lot of conifers around it?

01:10:59.803 --> 01:11:00.715
Are we talking pine trees?
LAURA: I don't know,

01:11:00.715 --> 01:11:02.321
I didn't get a good look at the trees.

01:11:02.321 --> 01:11:04.285
I saw snow, I saw beacon.

01:11:04.285 --> 01:11:06.119
I saw kind of blurry.

01:11:06.119 --> 01:11:07.210
TRAVIS: Heavy snow?
MARISHA: Heavy snow?

01:11:07.210 --> 01:11:08.689
LAURA: Light snow.
MARISHA: Okay.

01:11:08.689 --> 01:11:11.893
LAURA: It was daytime, the sky was gray.

01:11:11.893 --> 01:11:13.261
MARISHA: Sky was gray?
LAURA: Yes.

01:11:13.261 --> 01:11:14.094
MARISHA: And it was day?

01:11:14.094 --> 01:11:15.456
LAURA: And it was day.
MATT: ♪ And the sky was gray ♪

01:11:15.456 --> 01:11:17.956
MARISHA: The leaves were brown, okay.

01:11:19.375 --> 01:11:20.580
What was the name of that forest

01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:23.439
that's right on the north side of Rexxentrum?

01:11:23.439 --> 01:11:26.202
MATT: There's the Pearlbow Wilderness.

01:11:26.202 --> 01:11:30.235
MARISHA: The Pearlbow Wilderness, okay.

01:11:30.235 --> 01:11:32.811
I mean, I guess we can check in with the Soul

01:11:32.811 --> 01:11:34.246
and tell them what we saw.

01:11:34.246 --> 01:11:37.268
Ask them if it's cloudy or overcast.

01:11:37.268 --> 01:11:40.090
LAURA: I mean, we can try, but I don't think

01:11:40.090 --> 01:11:43.062
at this point, the point is, you know,

01:11:43.062 --> 01:11:45.096
Lucien is probably not going to find it.

01:11:45.096 --> 01:11:50.096
I mean, unless he has the ability
to amplify his spells, too.

01:11:50.482 --> 01:11:51.672
SAM: He might,

01:11:51.672 --> 01:11:54.086
but even then, he'd have to teleport there,

01:11:54.086 --> 01:11:56.188
which is risky and then.
LIAM: Right.

01:11:56.188 --> 01:11:57.790
SAM: Figure out where "there" is

01:11:57.790 --> 01:12:00.404
and then teleport back, which is risky.

01:12:00.404 --> 01:12:02.364
TALIESIN: Took it off the board, I think,

01:12:02.364 --> 01:12:04.065
I think we made it hard to get.

01:12:04.065 --> 01:12:05.609
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: But some

01:12:05.609 --> 01:12:09.388
huntsman or huntswoman is going to
find a rare treat in the woods.

01:12:09.388 --> 01:12:10.388
LAURA: Yeah!

01:12:10.388 --> 01:12:12.710
MARISHA: Some scavenger's going to cash in big.

01:12:12.710 --> 01:12:14.947
MATT: You're not wrong.

01:12:14.947 --> 01:12:17.378
MARISHA: 500 years from now, someone's going to find it

01:12:17.378 --> 01:12:19.730
in some old person's attic.

01:12:19.730 --> 01:12:22.287
TALIESIN: Five kids wandering through the forest

01:12:22.287 --> 01:12:24.313
are going to get in a fight about who gets the magic--

01:12:24.313 --> 01:12:26.803
LIAM: (old person voice)
This is my humble figurine collection.

01:12:26.803 --> 01:12:28.795
This is the biggest one.

01:12:31.185 --> 01:12:33.610
(Caleb voice) Caduceus, Jester.

01:12:34.642 --> 01:12:36.900
It's beyond your capabilities to,

01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:41.853
if we went to Rexxentrum, to hone in on it, correct?

01:12:41.853 --> 01:12:44.630
That's a little too--
TALIESIN: We don't know if it's there.

01:12:44.630 --> 01:12:46.741
LAURA: Yeah, usually a spell only works

01:12:46.741 --> 01:12:48.101
like a thousand feet away.

01:12:48.101 --> 01:12:49.864
We'd have to be super close to it.

01:12:49.864 --> 01:12:50.697
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:12:51.980 --> 01:12:54.831
LIAM: Well, <i>scheiße.</i>
LAURA: Hey Yussa!

01:12:54.831 --> 01:12:56.646
If somebody were to take your blood

01:12:56.646 --> 01:12:58.402
and they could track you with your blood

01:12:58.402 --> 01:12:59.305
would you know how to make it

01:12:59.305 --> 01:13:01.208
to where they couldn't track you anymore?

01:13:01.208 --> 01:13:02.746
SAM: Like change our blood?

01:13:02.746 --> 01:13:03.960
LAURA: Yeah.

01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:06.951
MATT: "I would not recommend that at all.

01:13:06.951 --> 01:13:11.368
"There are certain magics that can blanket divination."

01:13:12.852 --> 01:13:14.663
LAURA: Do you know how to do that, can you make us--

01:13:14.663 --> 01:13:18.305
MATT: He glances at the object sitting on your chest.

01:13:18.305 --> 01:13:19.660
LAURA: Yeah, like that.

01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:21.167
MATT: "Correct, such a device like that

01:13:21.167 --> 01:13:23.141
"can do exactly what you request."

01:13:23.141 --> 01:13:26.171
LAURA: Oh, do you have any of these?

01:13:26.171 --> 01:13:27.919
MATT: "I do not, unfortunately."

01:13:27.919 --> 01:13:28.752
LAURA: Oh.

01:13:30.566 --> 01:13:32.734
TALIESIN: Hmm.
LAURA: (gasps)

01:13:32.734 --> 01:13:33.953
I wonder if your friends would have access

01:13:33.953 --> 01:13:35.286
to more of them.

01:13:36.830 --> 01:13:37.663
SAM: Friends?

01:13:38.551 --> 01:13:39.884
You mean Astrid?
LIAM: Mm-hmm.

01:13:41.634 --> 01:13:45.834
Yeah, that's a conversation we probably need to have.

01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:49.932
SAM: Did we want to speak with--

01:13:49.932 --> 01:13:51.128
MARISHA: Pretty blonde girl?

01:13:51.128 --> 01:13:55.349
SAM: Allura Vysoren, I believe her name is?

01:13:55.349 --> 01:13:57.941
MATT: "Allow me," and Yussa steps out for a minute

01:13:57.941 --> 01:14:00.057
and begins to speak into the air.

01:14:02.832 --> 01:14:07.832
"Allura, you recall that strange troupe

01:14:08.399 --> 01:14:09.857
"you interacted with,

01:14:09.857 --> 01:14:11.938
"The Mighty Nein?

01:14:11.938 --> 01:14:13.981
"They may need your help.

01:14:13.981 --> 01:14:16.253
"Might they pop by?"

01:14:16.253 --> 01:14:17.636
MARISHA: What? Wait, what?

01:14:17.636 --> 01:14:19.470
SAM: Were you just rehearsing
what you're going to say to her,

01:14:19.470 --> 01:14:20.599
because I do that sometimes--

01:14:20.599 --> 01:14:22.907
MATT: Puts his finger up.
SAM: Oh.

01:14:22.907 --> 01:14:24.739
LIAM: (sharp inhale) (lip pop)

01:14:24.739 --> 01:14:25.806
MATT: "Very well, if you'd like,

01:14:25.806 --> 01:14:27.324
"I can send you to her chambers."

01:14:27.324 --> 01:14:28.975
SAM: Send us to her?!

01:14:28.975 --> 01:14:30.471
TRAVIS: Wait a minute.
LAURA: I thought she was going to come here!

01:14:30.471 --> 01:14:31.480
We get to go there?!

01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:33.071
We get to go-- I mean, like, wherever.

01:14:33.071 --> 01:14:34.679
Where are we going? It's no big deal.

01:14:34.679 --> 01:14:36.489
TRAVIS: Where is she located?

01:14:36.489 --> 01:14:38.900
MATT: "She's located in the city of Emon in Tal'Dorei."

01:14:38.900 --> 01:14:40.161
TRAVIS: Mm.
TALIESIN: I've never heard of that.

01:14:40.161 --> 01:14:41.827
TRAVIS: I am unfamiliar with it.

01:14:41.827 --> 01:14:43.887
LAURA: Would she be able to send us back here?

01:14:43.887 --> 01:14:46.853
MATT: "Yes, she would very much be able to.

01:14:46.853 --> 01:14:49.111
"Or you could just return to my tower when you need to."

01:14:49.111 --> 01:14:50.798
LIAM: <i>Ja.</i> Mm-hmm.
TRAVIS: Yes, yes, mm-hmm.

01:14:50.798 --> 01:14:51.939
MARISHA: Wow.

01:14:51.939 --> 01:14:54.289
TRAVIS: That would be another city on our checklist of

01:14:54.289 --> 01:14:56.091
buh-blah blah (pops), right?

01:14:56.091 --> 01:14:57.790
LIAM: Correct, correct.

01:14:57.790 --> 01:15:00.399
TALIESIN: I'd like to get a souvenir shot glass.

01:15:00.399 --> 01:15:01.772
If that's all right with everyone.

01:15:01.772 --> 01:15:06.625
TRAVIS: Boy, sounds dull. I don't know. Perhaps we should?

01:15:06.625 --> 01:15:08.288
LIAM: Let's go see your mother instead.

01:15:08.288 --> 01:15:09.850
SAM: Why not?

01:15:09.850 --> 01:15:10.683
MARISHA: What are the people like?

01:15:10.683 --> 01:15:11.516
Are they stuffy?

01:15:11.516 --> 01:15:13.832
Are they, are they bougie?

01:15:13.832 --> 01:15:16.456
SAM: Is it like the Cleveland of Tal'Dorei?

01:15:16.456 --> 01:15:17.976
Is it sort of like--

01:15:17.976 --> 01:15:20.074
MARISHA: Yeah, kind of artsy?
SAM: A little shitty?

01:15:20.074 --> 01:15:22.625
Sorry, Cleveland.

01:15:22.625 --> 01:15:24.153
MARISHA: They've got good music.

01:15:24.153 --> 01:15:26.961
TRAVIS: I liked Cleveland.
MARISHA: Yeah!

01:15:26.961 --> 01:15:28.534
MATT: "It's certainly been a bit unfocused

01:15:28.534 --> 01:15:32.476
"since they've established the Republic, but it--

01:15:34.179 --> 01:15:37.933
"I don't know, it's a bit cramped for my tastes.

01:15:37.933 --> 01:15:41.569
"I like it closer to, well,

01:15:41.569 --> 01:15:44.069
"more relaxed coast atmosphere."

01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:47.229
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's go.

01:15:47.229 --> 01:15:48.717
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:15:48.717 --> 01:15:50.585
Yeah, yeah, I mean, you can send us there.

01:15:50.585 --> 01:15:53.999
LIAM: Jump us around, new place?
MATT: "Very well."

01:15:53.999 --> 01:15:56.294
Yussa leads you back down

01:15:56.294 --> 01:15:59.430
to the teleportation chamber where the central rune

01:15:59.430 --> 01:16:03.920
of arrival is located and begins to scrawl out his circle.

01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:06.461
LIAM: Wait one moment! I'm so sorry.

01:16:06.461 --> 01:16:07.294
MATT: "Yes?"

01:16:07.294 --> 01:16:11.059
LIAM: Do you, by any chance, have any spare pieces

01:16:11.059 --> 01:16:15.142
of amber that I could purchase, borrow?

01:16:19.227 --> 01:16:20.641
MATT: "Just a moment."

01:16:20.641 --> 01:16:25.073
He steps back up the stairs
and returns a couple minutes later.

01:16:25.073 --> 01:16:27.697
SAM: This has been such a fantastic visit.

01:16:27.697 --> 01:16:28.530
LAURA: Yeah.

01:16:28.530 --> 01:16:30.913
MARISHA: I think this is the
most we've ever talked to Yussa.

01:16:30.913 --> 01:16:32.057
TRAVIS: Yes, it is.

01:16:32.057 --> 01:16:34.357
TALIESIN: I think it's the most Yussa's
ever talked to anybody else.

01:16:34.357 --> 01:16:35.403
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:16:35.403 --> 01:16:37.454
MATT: You're possibly not wrong.
ASHLEY: Yeah, he's very Yus-ful.

01:16:37.454 --> 01:16:38.865
MATT: In a positive way.
TALIESIN: No, and--

01:16:38.865 --> 01:16:40.003
MATT: He definitely gives off that,

01:16:40.003 --> 01:16:42.810
like, get off my lawn energy to--

01:16:42.810 --> 01:16:44.278
I mean, even you guys in your first time meeting him.

01:16:44.278 --> 01:16:45.476
TALIESIN: I feel like the Happy Fun Ball

01:16:45.476 --> 01:16:47.460
really went far and it helps that it wasn't nearly

01:16:47.460 --> 01:16:49.582
as long for him as it was for us.

01:16:49.582 --> 01:16:52.023
TRAVIS: When we bring ancient unknown knowledge

01:16:52.023 --> 01:16:53.255
now he's interested.

01:16:53.255 --> 01:16:56.713
MATT: Yeah, I mean, you've definitely piqued his interest

01:16:56.713 --> 01:16:59.383
as far as a relationship goes compared to

01:16:59.383 --> 01:17:01.781
pretty much most of the people that come across his tower.

01:17:03.023 --> 01:17:05.322
But he comes over to you with three pieces of amber.

01:17:05.322 --> 01:17:08.204
The smooth gems worth about 50 gold a piece.

01:17:08.204 --> 01:17:09.237
TALIESIN: Fancy.

01:17:09.237 --> 01:17:11.487
LIAM: I can repay you for this.

01:17:13.030 --> 01:17:15.330
MATT: "I will say that you're

01:17:16.373 --> 01:17:20.040
"making your way on a very dangerous journey."
MARISHA: ♪ Making my way ♪

01:17:21.173 --> 01:17:23.673
MATT: "Consider it an addition to my,

01:17:26.313 --> 01:17:28.633
"my aid that I can offer at the moment."

01:17:29.533 --> 01:17:31.893
LIAM: You truly are too kind.

01:17:31.893 --> 01:17:34.276
MATT: "Don't get that stuck in your head."

01:17:34.276 --> 01:17:35.588
LIAM: <i>Danke.</i>

01:17:35.588 --> 01:17:38.170
MATT: Finishes drawing his circle

01:17:38.170 --> 01:17:40.476
and as he connects the final thread

01:17:40.476 --> 01:17:45.163
of a line to the central point, it lights up.

01:17:45.163 --> 01:17:47.763
TRAVIS: Everyone.
SAM: Get in, get in, get in.

01:17:47.763 --> 01:17:50.459
MATT: You all dart through.

01:17:50.459 --> 01:17:51.786
As you all emerge--
LAURA: Who are we going to meet?

01:17:51.786 --> 01:17:54.289
MARISHA: Oh my goodness!
LIAM: Emon or bust!

01:17:54.289 --> 01:17:57.495
MATT: You all emerge in a chamber that is

01:17:57.495 --> 01:17:59.559
more lit than the one you left.

01:17:59.559 --> 01:18:01.379
You immediately look around and there are these

01:18:01.379 --> 01:18:04.082
white stone walls around you with

01:18:04.082 --> 01:18:06.871
faint blue banners, beautiful calligraphy

01:18:06.871 --> 01:18:08.494
and design stitched into them.

01:18:08.494 --> 01:18:11.854
You can see some furniture in the corner of this

01:18:11.854 --> 01:18:16.459
a blue couch stretched across a dark wooden frame,

01:18:16.459 --> 01:18:19.759
a central circular carpet in the center of the room.

01:18:19.759 --> 01:18:21.359
LIAM: Guys.

01:18:21.359 --> 01:18:22.441
SAM: Carpet?
LIAM: Carpet.

01:18:22.441 --> 01:18:23.731
TALIESIN: I'm freaking out.

01:18:23.731 --> 01:18:26.364
(laughter)

01:18:26.364 --> 01:18:28.274
MATT: And a staircase that goes up.

01:18:28.274 --> 01:18:31.388
This is the bottom floor of this
beautiful, alabaster, white tower.

01:18:31.388 --> 01:18:35.262
(excited noises)

01:18:35.262 --> 01:18:37.107
MARISHA: It's like seeing an old friend.
ASHLEY: Yeah!

01:18:37.107 --> 01:18:39.310
LIAM: God, it's like visiting your childhood home.

01:18:39.310 --> 01:18:40.143
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:18:41.820 --> 01:18:43.284
MATT: As soon as you all take in your surroundings,

01:18:43.284 --> 01:18:45.092
you hear a voice echo from high above

01:18:45.092 --> 01:18:47.244
and you can see that the

01:18:47.244 --> 01:18:49.244
floor is about 25 feet above you

01:18:49.244 --> 01:18:52.416
where the next platform or the next stage of the tower

01:18:52.416 --> 01:18:54.648
would be, you assume you're probably in the base floor

01:18:54.648 --> 01:18:55.481
and you can look behind you.

01:18:55.481 --> 01:18:58.278
You can see there's a large entryway that leads in,

01:18:58.278 --> 01:19:00.452
and you hear a voice echo down from above that says,

01:19:00.452 --> 01:19:02.298
(as Allura) "Just a moment, hold on."

01:19:02.298 --> 01:19:04.524
TRAVIS: Oh, I know how this works. Up!

01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:06.733
Anything?

01:19:06.733 --> 01:19:08.600
MATT: No, nothing.

01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:10.072
You get a little hop.

01:19:10.072 --> 01:19:11.791
A couple inches in height.
LIAM: Hop!

01:19:11.791 --> 01:19:14.235
TALIESIN: You got a coin.

01:19:14.235 --> 01:19:16.138
MARISHA: Oh, hit the block.

01:19:16.138 --> 01:19:19.303
LIAM: Guys, we are so much further south on the globe

01:19:19.303 --> 01:19:21.412
than we were just a handful of hours ago.

01:19:21.412 --> 01:19:22.700
LAURA: Oh my gosh, it's so weird.

01:19:22.700 --> 01:19:24.197
TALIESIN: I've never been this far.

01:19:24.197 --> 01:19:26.248
MARISHA: I think-- is there,

01:19:26.248 --> 01:19:28.805
I think there's a Cobalt Soul branch here.

01:19:28.805 --> 01:19:30.298
Is there a Cobalt Soul branch here?

01:19:30.298 --> 01:19:31.215
MATT: There is.

01:19:32.726 --> 01:19:33.859
TALIESIN: It's like Starbucks, it's everywhere.

01:19:33.859 --> 01:19:35.531
MARISHA: Yeah, we're a franchise.

01:19:35.531 --> 01:19:37.123
LIAM: Weird accents, though.

01:19:38.627 --> 01:19:39.736
MATT: Technically, I think Emon would be

01:19:39.736 --> 01:19:41.467
a little bit higher than the coast.

01:19:41.467 --> 01:19:43.457
LIAM: Oh, because it's side by side right?

01:19:43.457 --> 01:19:44.864
MATT: Correct.

01:19:44.864 --> 01:19:47.641
LIAM: But we were on the top of the world

01:19:47.641 --> 01:19:48.613
near Santa's workshop?

01:19:48.613 --> 01:19:52.091
MATT: Correct, yes, you are much further south than that.

01:19:52.091 --> 01:19:56.182
This would be, latitude-wise, a little

01:19:57.087 --> 01:19:58.853
don't quote me on it, but I think a little bit south

01:19:58.853 --> 01:20:00.815
of where Rexxentrum.

01:20:00.815 --> 01:20:02.666
Let's say close to like where Zadash is.

01:20:02.666 --> 01:20:03.849
LIAM: I'll quote you on that.

01:20:03.849 --> 01:20:05.790
LAURA: Okay, okay.

01:20:05.790 --> 01:20:06.678
MATT: As far as latitude goes.

01:20:06.678 --> 01:20:09.448
But nevertheless, you wait for a moment, looking around.

01:20:09.448 --> 01:20:11.110
There are places to sit,

01:20:11.110 --> 01:20:12.468
and you hear a voice go,

01:20:12.468 --> 01:20:14.826
"Make yourself comfortable, be just a moment."

01:20:14.826 --> 01:20:16.632
Some of the furniture just

01:20:16.632 --> 01:20:18.912
scoots a little closer towards you.

01:20:18.912 --> 01:20:19.745
LIAM: Classy.

01:20:20.948 --> 01:20:22.905
LAURA: Sit down.
TRAVIS: Sit.

01:20:22.905 --> 01:20:23.951
SAM: Anything shiny around?

01:20:23.951 --> 01:20:27.284
LAURA: I sit next to Caduceus and we just bounce.

01:20:27.284 --> 01:20:30.968
MATT: You hear some like faint clattering sound,

01:20:30.968 --> 01:20:33.807
just very gentle (rattling).

01:20:33.807 --> 01:20:38.177
And you watch as a tray, a very wide, silver tray

01:20:38.177 --> 01:20:42.401
with all manner of teas and snacks and arrangements

01:20:42.401 --> 01:20:45.020
just drifts down the staircase

01:20:45.020 --> 01:20:48.280
and about to two feet behind it, you see walking down,

01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:52.469
her hair put into these two sets of smaller braids

01:20:52.469 --> 01:20:54.995
that have been tied into a slight spiral

01:20:54.995 --> 01:20:56.931
that travels down past the mid-back.

01:20:56.931 --> 01:20:59.129
She has this golden band across the head

01:20:59.129 --> 01:21:00.476
that holds it in place.

01:21:00.476 --> 01:21:03.326
Beautiful scrolling and calligraphy on it.

01:21:03.326 --> 01:21:04.327
Allura Vysoren.

01:21:04.327 --> 01:21:05.668
LIAM: Queen.

01:21:05.668 --> 01:21:09.531
MATT: This like gentle, it's a very nice, comfortable,

01:21:09.531 --> 01:21:11.300
I want to say like a half a dress, half-robe.

01:21:11.300 --> 01:21:13.547
It's folded over in the front and it's tied.

01:21:13.547 --> 01:21:14.978
It looks beautiful and presentable,

01:21:14.978 --> 01:21:18.278
but it's definitely comfortable as she steps down behind it.

01:21:18.278 --> 01:21:21.726
"Well, I wasn't quite expecting company

01:21:21.726 --> 01:21:23.737
"at this time, let alone yourselves,

01:21:23.737 --> 01:21:27.332
"but Yussa seemed to speak that it was rather urgent?"

01:21:27.332 --> 01:21:28.805
MARISHA: Oh, what time is it?

01:21:28.805 --> 01:21:30.972
I forgot about the time zones.

01:21:30.972 --> 01:21:33.518
TALIESIN: We've changed twice anyway in the last hour.

01:21:33.518 --> 01:21:37.695
LIAM: Is it the morning where we are right now or no? <i>Ja</i>?

01:21:37.695 --> 01:21:42.695
MATT: "At this point in the day, it is rather early."

01:21:42.838 --> 01:21:45.407
LAURA: Sorry about that, Allura.

01:21:45.407 --> 01:21:47.940
MATT: "Oh, that's all right.

01:21:47.940 --> 01:21:50.707
"But nevertheless, you're here.

01:21:51.601 --> 01:21:52.745
"Would you care for some--"

01:21:52.745 --> 01:21:54.917
and you see the little tiny end table

01:21:54.917 --> 01:21:56.607
scoots over (creaks) on its own

01:21:56.607 --> 01:21:59.582
and the tray drops on to the bottom.

01:21:59.582 --> 01:22:01.029
"Perhaps some tea or snacks, if you'd like?"

01:22:01.029 --> 01:22:02.098
TRAVIS: That's very kind.

01:22:02.098 --> 01:22:03.087
LAURA: Yes, yes.

01:22:03.087 --> 01:22:05.970
Caduceus, you can try tea from Emon!

01:22:05.970 --> 01:22:08.145
TALIESIN: (grunts)

01:22:08.145 --> 01:22:09.435
LAURA: Is it good?

01:22:09.435 --> 01:22:10.740
SAM: Is it the same?

01:22:10.740 --> 01:22:13.685
TALIESIN: I'm going to try everything available.

01:22:13.685 --> 01:22:14.768
MATT: You hear some additional footsteps heading

01:22:14.768 --> 01:22:17.010
down the steps and--
LAURA: Do you have any cookies?

01:22:17.010 --> 01:22:19.887
MATT: There are some cookies on there.

01:22:19.887 --> 01:22:23.095
And you see in another comfortable outfit

01:22:23.095 --> 01:22:26.002
a shorter, stockier female form,

01:22:26.002 --> 01:22:28.740
darker skin, almost like an

01:22:28.740 --> 01:22:32.934
ashen auburn hair, walk down,

01:22:32.934 --> 01:22:34.602
looking a bit grumpy and

01:22:36.710 --> 01:22:38.399
like they woke up not too long ago

01:22:38.399 --> 01:22:39.789
and as she comes down and scratching her face,

01:22:39.789 --> 01:22:42.848
you see a little bit of a scar on one side,

01:22:42.848 --> 01:22:45.015
(as Kima) "Okay, so are these--

01:22:46.631 --> 01:22:49.279
"these idiots-- these friends that were

01:22:49.279 --> 01:22:52.785
"in that weird ball thing you were mentioning?"

01:22:52.785 --> 01:22:56.348
(as Allura) "Yes, you're welcome to join, if you'd like."

01:22:56.348 --> 01:22:59.204
(as Kima) "Well, we haven't had
company in a while I suppose, so.

01:22:59.204 --> 01:23:02.339
"Hi, I'm Kima, what's your thing?"

01:23:02.339 --> 01:23:03.586
ASHLEY: Hello.
MARISHA: 'Sup.

01:23:03.586 --> 01:23:04.554
TALIESIN: Hey.
SAM: Hi!

01:23:04.554 --> 01:23:06.998
LIAM: We are the Mighty Nein.

01:23:06.998 --> 01:23:08.958
We are those assholes.

01:23:08.958 --> 01:23:10.305
Pardon us.

01:23:10.305 --> 01:23:12.982
MATT: (as Kima) "That's all right. We've known a few."

01:23:12.982 --> 01:23:15.053
She goes over and scoots up, grabs a stool,

01:23:15.053 --> 01:23:17.215
and joins you all the table

01:23:17.215 --> 01:23:19.352
and begins munching on the snacks.

01:23:19.352 --> 01:23:21.585
And at first, it's very casual.

01:23:24.595 --> 01:23:28.063
Caduceus, Caleb, and Beauregard,

01:23:28.063 --> 01:23:30.875
you notice that, while this Kima figure's keeping it casual,

01:23:30.875 --> 01:23:35.829
she is very intently reading each of you head to toe,

01:23:35.829 --> 01:23:36.829
she is very intently reading each of you head to toe,

01:23:36.829 --> 01:23:39.062
like going from a "welcome to my house,"

01:23:39.062 --> 01:23:44.062
to a military-style bead on each of you.

01:23:44.773 --> 01:23:45.606
TALIESIN: She's cool.

01:23:45.606 --> 01:23:47.102
MATT: And is definitely imposing herself

01:23:47.102 --> 01:23:48.778
at a slight angle to put a shoulder

01:23:48.778 --> 01:23:51.762
between Allura and the rest of you in a protective fashion.

01:23:51.762 --> 01:23:56.579
Allura sits down. "So to what do we owe the pleasure?"

01:23:57.659 --> 01:24:00.392
LAURA: Well! We tell her.

01:24:00.392 --> 01:24:02.700
(laughter)

01:24:06.086 --> 01:24:07.152
MATT: (as Allura) "Right.

01:24:08.645 --> 01:24:10.928
"This is quite disturbing.

01:24:11.912 --> 01:24:16.574
"And this individual, this Nonagon you speak of,

01:24:16.574 --> 01:24:20.985
"what do you understand of their capabilities?"

01:24:20.985 --> 01:24:23.224
SAM: He seemed to have a lot of

01:24:23.224 --> 01:24:25.284
mental gymnastics that they can do.

01:24:25.284 --> 01:24:29.369
They have eyes printed on their body

01:24:29.369 --> 01:24:31.886
that can cast spells, we think.

01:24:31.886 --> 01:24:35.102
And also Beauregard learned that they have extreme

01:24:35.102 --> 01:24:37.602
And also Beauregard learned that they have extreme

01:24:37.602 --> 01:24:40.731
you know, mental psychic abilities, right?

01:24:40.731 --> 01:24:44.955
MARISHA: Yeah, he almost killed me by exploding my brain.

01:24:44.955 --> 01:24:49.847
TALIESIN: I mean, we've got to
talk about things at some point.

01:24:50.987 --> 01:24:53.904
MATT: "What sorts of spells was it able to cast?"

01:24:53.904 --> 01:24:56.660
LAURA: He cast a spell that caused us to not

01:24:56.660 --> 01:24:59.438
be able to cast anything.

01:24:59.438 --> 01:25:01.176
MATT: "Like an anti-magic sphere?"

01:25:01.176 --> 01:25:02.824
LIAM: Yes, but it's sort of --

01:25:02.824 --> 01:25:03.657
SAM: Shot out.

01:25:03.657 --> 01:25:07.228
LIAM: -- blazed over area of the fields we were on

01:25:07.228 --> 01:25:09.847
and it was a fixed space of battlefield.

01:25:09.847 --> 01:25:12.239
It did not turn with him.

01:25:12.239 --> 01:25:13.380
LAURA: Oh, it did turn.
SAM: No, it did turn.

01:25:13.380 --> 01:25:14.297
LIAM: I thought it didn't.

01:25:14.297 --> 01:25:16.246
TALIESIN: No, it didn't.

01:25:16.246 --> 01:25:18.664
MATT: It didn't turn-- the eye moved over the body

01:25:18.664 --> 01:25:21.638
when he turned around and then he was able to shift it.

01:25:21.638 --> 01:25:24.912
LIAM: Oh, so he could use it like a little robot eye?

01:25:24.912 --> 01:25:26.144
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's real shit.

01:25:26.144 --> 01:25:26.977
LIAM: Oh shit.

01:25:26.977 --> 01:25:29.062
LAURA: And it seemed like it came from the eye, right?

01:25:29.062 --> 01:25:32.570
So I imagine that each one of his

01:25:32.570 --> 01:25:36.077
"tattoos" could do the same sort of--

01:25:36.077 --> 01:25:39.289
or could do something interesting, terrible.

01:25:39.289 --> 01:25:41.018
MATT: She sets her glass down.

01:25:41.018 --> 01:25:42.707
MARISHA: He also doesn't sleep.

01:25:42.707 --> 01:25:43.860
LAURA: Ever.

01:25:43.860 --> 01:25:46.933
MARISHA: He just says he only dreams.

01:25:46.933 --> 01:25:48.263
MATT: "Oh, well, that seems fun."

01:25:48.263 --> 01:25:49.740
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:25:49.740 --> 01:25:51.904
TALIESIN: It's been a very disturbing week.

01:25:51.904 --> 01:25:54.655
SAM: Oh, hey, he also seems to be able to watch us

01:25:54.655 --> 01:25:58.401
all the time so maybe do a little scan-y.

01:25:58.401 --> 01:26:00.301
MATT: Immediately as you say that,
you watch as Allura's eyes

01:26:00.301 --> 01:26:02.059
just shine with a silver shimmer

01:26:02.059 --> 01:26:04.041
just passing over them

01:26:04.041 --> 01:26:06.066
and immediately starts looking about.

01:26:08.664 --> 01:26:10.401
And she points a finger.

01:26:10.401 --> 01:26:11.317
MARISHA: Shit!

01:26:13.102 --> 01:26:14.801
MATT: "Thank you for the warning."

01:26:14.801 --> 01:26:15.968
SAM: Sorry, sorry.

01:26:16.946 --> 01:26:20.836
We've brought the danger to your house, sorry.

01:26:20.836 --> 01:26:21.857
MATT: "Wonderful."

01:26:21.857 --> 01:26:24.737
And Kima just sit there and goes,

01:26:24.737 --> 01:26:25.769
"I'm not going to take any chances,"

01:26:25.769 --> 01:26:28.177
and she gets up and walks up the stairs.

01:26:28.177 --> 01:26:29.647
SAM: Oh.

01:26:29.647 --> 01:26:33.012
MATT: (as Allura) "Well, an anti-magic cone

01:26:33.012 --> 01:26:37.012
"is unfortunate, especially for those of you with

01:26:38.620 --> 01:26:40.901
"a skill set that requires it.

01:26:40.901 --> 01:26:41.772
"There are a number of creatures

01:26:41.772 --> 01:26:43.686
"in nature that utilize such defenses,

01:26:43.686 --> 01:26:46.660
"very dangerous ones: beholders and such.

01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:48.914
"There are some tools that have been developed

01:26:48.914 --> 01:26:51.120
"in the hunting of such beings.

01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:53.378
"I'll see what I can muster."

01:26:53.378 --> 01:26:57.660
MARISHA: Do you know anything about these Luxon beacons

01:26:57.660 --> 01:26:59.215
that are so attached to the Dynasty?

01:26:59.215 --> 01:27:02.835
They seem pretty convinced that these beacons

01:27:02.835 --> 01:27:05.040
can be scattered across all of Exandria.

01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:06.184
Do you know if--?

01:27:06.184 --> 01:27:10.825
MATT: "I know a cursory bit about the religious history

01:27:10.825 --> 01:27:13.191
"of the Kryn.

01:27:13.191 --> 01:27:15.639
"I know of these relics, these artifacts,

01:27:15.639 --> 01:27:18.994
"their religious significance.

01:27:18.994 --> 01:27:20.615
"But no more than that."

01:27:20.615 --> 01:27:23.139
MARISHA: Have you not discovered any here in Emon

01:27:23.139 --> 01:27:24.805
or in Tal'Dorei?

01:27:25.654 --> 01:27:27.383
MATT: "Not to my knowledge, no."

01:27:27.383 --> 01:27:28.786
MARISHA: Insight check.

01:27:28.786 --> 01:27:30.679
MATT: Make an insight check.

01:27:30.679 --> 01:27:33.706
SAM: What if she's the big bad of this?

01:27:33.706 --> 01:27:35.553
MATT: That would be so epic.

01:27:35.553 --> 01:27:37.827
That would be incredible.

01:27:37.827 --> 01:27:40.277
TALIESIN: Welcome to the long game.

01:27:40.277 --> 01:27:41.330
MATT: It's going to make watching the animated series

01:27:41.330 --> 01:27:43.630
that much more awkward.

01:27:43.630 --> 01:27:44.680
MARISHA: 16.

01:27:45.702 --> 01:27:46.535
It's okay.

01:27:48.785 --> 01:27:50.037
MATT: No, she seems to be genuine.

01:27:50.037 --> 01:27:51.770
She's not-- has nothing to hide it seems.

01:27:51.770 --> 01:27:52.915
MARISHA: Okay.

01:27:52.915 --> 01:27:55.238
TRAVIS: You said there were tools that it might aid

01:27:55.238 --> 01:27:57.007
in the hunting of such creatures that

01:27:57.007 --> 01:28:00.174
have an anti-magic cone or sphere?

01:28:01.633 --> 01:28:05.615
Do you know-- it canceled out our magic.

01:28:05.615 --> 01:28:09.503
Does it have the same effect with magical items, weapons?

01:28:09.503 --> 01:28:12.493
LAURA: It did. It canceled out Caduceus' glasses.

01:28:12.493 --> 01:28:14.460
He couldn't see in the dark anymore.

01:28:14.460 --> 01:28:18.012
MATT: "If it does indeed follow a similar pattern as to this

01:28:18.012 --> 01:28:20.547
"capability of other such creatures, then yes.

01:28:20.547 --> 01:28:22.745
"Enchanted objects, while they are within the field,

01:28:22.745 --> 01:28:26.431
"are also negated into just mundane objects."

01:28:26.431 --> 01:28:28.308
TRAVIS: Enchanted objects.
TALIESIN: Is it breakable?

01:28:28.308 --> 01:28:32.960
TRAVIS: Not to alarm you, and I will summon the Star Razor,

01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:34.627
blade down, hilt up.

01:28:35.564 --> 01:28:36.684
I don't know if it's enchanted.

01:28:36.684 --> 01:28:40.643
We went through quite a bit of effort to try and

01:28:40.643 --> 01:28:41.737
correct, fix this.

01:28:41.737 --> 01:28:43.713
MATT: "Where did you find that?"

01:28:43.713 --> 01:28:46.013
TALIESIN: Kind of made it. Well, no.

01:28:47.220 --> 01:28:49.187
LAURA: Kind of made it.
TALIESIN: It found us and then we fixed it.

01:28:49.187 --> 01:28:51.654
TRAVIS: What do you-- do you know this?

01:28:51.654 --> 01:28:52.981
MATT: "Do you mind?"

01:28:52.981 --> 01:28:54.386
TRAVIS: No, not at all.

01:28:54.386 --> 01:28:55.764
MATT: She grasps the handle and you watch

01:28:55.764 --> 01:28:57.744
as she places her fingers over it.

01:28:57.744 --> 01:29:00.593
Her eyes give this faint orange-ish glow

01:29:00.593 --> 01:29:05.593
and a bit of orange-ish energy shimmers across it.

01:29:05.818 --> 01:29:08.610
Almost like a laser wave and goes,

01:29:09.969 --> 01:29:11.214
"Hold tightly to that, my friend.

01:29:11.214 --> 01:29:14.451
"That is a powerful thing you hold."

01:29:14.451 --> 01:29:16.752
TRAVIS: Are you familiar with this blade?

01:29:16.752 --> 01:29:19.881
MATT: "Not that blade in particular, but items like it.

01:29:19.881 --> 01:29:23.648
"They're referred to as a Vestige of Divergence."

01:29:23.648 --> 01:29:25.272
SAM: A what?
ASHLEY: That's a Vestige?!

01:29:25.272 --> 01:29:26.743
LAURA: He got a Vestige.
TRAVIS: A Vestige of Divergence.

01:29:26.743 --> 01:29:28.950
SAM: Of what?
LIAM: Because we watched it--

01:29:28.950 --> 01:29:30.874
We watched it exalt when he killed Avantika.

01:29:30.874 --> 01:29:32.542
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.

01:29:32.542 --> 01:29:35.374
MATT: "Artifacts scattered

01:29:35.374 --> 01:29:38.240
"and, in some cases, recovered since the Calamity.

01:29:38.240 --> 01:29:40.790
"Divine artifacts forged by the gods themselves

01:29:40.790 --> 01:29:43.551
"or champions and chosen of their ilk

01:29:43.551 --> 01:29:47.281
"to combat the Betrayer Gods in the final conflicts of it."

01:29:47.281 --> 01:29:48.607
SAM: And <i>Fjord</i> got one?

01:29:48.607 --> 01:29:50.230
LIAM: You're telling us our friend is walking around

01:29:50.230 --> 01:29:52.620
with an artifact made by the gods?

01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:56.931
MATT: "Or made by a very powerful being of that time period,

01:29:56.931 --> 01:29:59.429
"which is quite a gift.

01:29:59.429 --> 01:30:02.147
"It also puts a target on your back

01:30:02.147 --> 01:30:04.901
"if others come to find this information.

01:30:04.901 --> 01:30:08.012
"So it would behoove you to--"

01:30:08.012 --> 01:30:09.570
TRAVIS: The sword disappears.
MATT: Yeah.

01:30:09.570 --> 01:30:12.725
"Good. Such things are very highly sought after.

01:30:12.725 --> 01:30:17.363
"And not always by the most moral individuals."

01:30:17.363 --> 01:30:19.630
TALIESIN: Found half of that basically in an antique shop.

01:30:19.630 --> 01:30:22.495
TRAVIS: Gods, Caduceus, thank you.

01:30:22.495 --> 01:30:23.871
TALIESIN: Oh, no problem and, you know,

01:30:23.871 --> 01:30:25.340
sorry about one more target on your back.

01:30:25.340 --> 01:30:27.405
I mean, I don't even know where you'd fit it.

01:30:27.405 --> 01:30:29.248
LIAM: That's three.

01:30:29.248 --> 01:30:30.294
TRAVIS: That is true.

01:30:30.294 --> 01:30:32.560
SAM: Four.
TRAVIS: Do you think-- (chuckles)

01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:35.135
do you think of vestige of this nature,

01:30:35.135 --> 01:30:36.330
do you think it would be canceled out

01:30:36.330 --> 01:30:39.089
by such an area of anti-magic?

01:30:39.937 --> 01:30:44.179
MATT: "It is very powerful enchantment on the weapon.

01:30:45.673 --> 01:30:46.925
"But I can't say because I do not know

01:30:46.925 --> 01:30:50.254
"the nature of the source of this negation.

01:30:50.254 --> 01:30:52.505
"If this entity, this Nonagon that you speak of

01:30:52.505 --> 01:30:57.005
"is indeed bestowed its capabilities by this--

01:30:58.412 --> 01:31:02.934
"an entity of this power, especially of Aeor,

01:31:02.934 --> 01:31:05.050
"these archmages of this time,

01:31:05.050 --> 01:31:06.122
"who knows the limits of it?

01:31:06.122 --> 01:31:08.230
"I would not count on it."

01:31:09.159 --> 01:31:11.753
LIAM: We find ourselves scratching at the edges

01:31:11.753 --> 01:31:13.336
of ancient history.

01:31:14.585 --> 01:31:16.627
You are highly learned; do you know anything

01:31:16.627 --> 01:31:19.877
about these philosophers, the Somnovem?

01:31:22.438 --> 01:31:25.692
MATT: "I'm afraid I don't know
more than what you've discovered.

01:31:25.692 --> 01:31:27.057
"Like you said, you scratch at the edges

01:31:27.057 --> 01:31:28.911
"of <i>ancient</i> history.

01:31:28.911 --> 01:31:30.704
"History that's only being uncovered

01:31:30.704 --> 01:31:33.447
"by the few individuals that are currently delving

01:31:33.447 --> 01:31:36.076
"and they are covetous of what they find.

01:31:36.076 --> 01:31:39.076
"Such information is extremely, well,

01:31:40.419 --> 01:31:42.169
"worth a lot of money.

01:31:43.479 --> 01:31:46.134
"So the fact that you've acquired what you have

01:31:46.134 --> 01:31:50.392
"through your clever means is incredible."

01:31:52.418 --> 01:31:54.193
LAURA: I have a question.

01:31:55.119 --> 01:31:59.807
The people that inherit the souls from the beacons

01:31:59.807 --> 01:32:03.347
they remember their previous lives, right?

01:32:03.347 --> 01:32:06.880
MATT: "I am not a specialist--
LAURA: Do we know?

01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:09.646
MATT: "-- on the beacons you speak of."

01:32:09.646 --> 01:32:11.043
LIAM: Meaning someone who is consecuted?

01:32:11.043 --> 01:32:12.752
They remember their--

01:32:12.752 --> 01:32:13.585
MATT: Yes, you would know,

01:32:13.585 --> 01:32:15.123
you recall, they do.

01:32:15.123 --> 01:32:16.866
When they're born with a new life, they do not.

01:32:16.866 --> 01:32:18.466
But then around adolescence

01:32:18.466 --> 01:32:19.923
they have what's called anamnesis.

01:32:19.923 --> 01:32:22.179
They begin to-- memories of their past lives

01:32:22.179 --> 01:32:24.086
begin to bleed with their current life.

01:32:24.086 --> 01:32:26.586
And they have to go through a

01:32:28.262 --> 01:32:32.031
assisted meditation to essentially consolidate

01:32:32.031 --> 01:32:35.403
all of their memories into one new person.

01:32:35.403 --> 01:32:36.740
LIAM: Which sort of hooks into what we know

01:32:36.740 --> 01:32:38.096
with children being kidnapped.

01:32:38.096 --> 01:32:39.062
MARISHA: Kidnapped, yeah.

01:32:39.062 --> 01:32:41.246
LIAM: The children didn't know what was up yet.

01:32:41.246 --> 01:32:43.657
ASHLEY: But if they don't go through that process,

01:32:43.657 --> 01:32:45.654
will they remember or no?

01:32:45.654 --> 01:32:47.562
MATT: You don't know.
ASHLEY: We don't know.

01:32:47.562 --> 01:32:51.029
LAURA: But the Bright Queen is one of the oldest souls?

01:32:51.029 --> 01:32:52.466
She remembers the most?

01:32:52.466 --> 01:32:53.536
TRAVIS: One of.
LIAM: One of the longest run.

01:32:53.536 --> 01:32:55.211
TRAVIS: That other--

01:32:55.211 --> 01:32:56.728
LIAM: The goblin.
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

01:32:56.728 --> 01:33:01.728
LAURA: Isn't it possible that she
would have memory of the time?

01:33:02.527 --> 01:33:04.225
Around then?

01:33:04.225 --> 01:33:06.060
If everything we're talking about--

01:33:06.060 --> 01:33:07.275
LIAM: Yeah, that is true.

01:33:07.664 --> 01:33:09.174
MATT: "It's possible."

01:33:09.174 --> 01:33:11.044
MARISHA: Do we know how long
the Bright Queen has been around,

01:33:11.044 --> 01:33:12.464
do we remember that?

01:33:12.464 --> 01:33:13.694
MATT: As far as you know, she's been around

01:33:13.694 --> 01:33:16.074
since the tail-end of the Calamity, at the very least.

01:33:16.074 --> 01:33:17.674
LIAM: A couple thou, right?

01:33:17.674 --> 01:33:18.667
TRAVIS: Around the same as Halas.

01:33:18.667 --> 01:33:20.107
MATT: 1,000 or more.
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:33:20.954 --> 01:33:22.974
TALIESIN: Boy, we're going to be
doing the round about, aren't we?

01:33:22.974 --> 01:33:26.364
MARISHA: I know, are we asking the wrong questions?

01:33:26.364 --> 01:33:27.254
TALIESIN: Or the wrong people?

01:33:27.254 --> 01:33:29.754
TRAVIS: No, I mean, Allura said that she has tools

01:33:29.754 --> 01:33:32.720
that can help us potentially fight an anti-magic--

01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:34.454
LAURA: You wouldn't want to come fight with us, would you?

01:33:34.454 --> 01:33:35.804
Help save the world?

01:33:35.804 --> 01:33:38.194
MATT: You see she rests her hands on her knee,

01:33:38.194 --> 01:33:41.124
or her elbows on her knees, and clasps her chin in her hand

01:33:41.124 --> 01:33:43.123
and goes, "I--"

01:33:43.123 --> 01:33:44.123
LAURA: Kima can come, too!

01:33:45.344 --> 01:33:47.144
SAM: Jester, don't be silly,

01:33:47.144 --> 01:33:49.924
Allura and Kima aren't the type that would go running off--

01:33:49.924 --> 01:33:51.273
TRAVIS: I don't think Kima is much of a fighter,

01:33:51.273 --> 01:33:52.294
she ran upstairs--
SAM: No, I don't think so.

01:33:52.294 --> 01:33:54.880
Look at their house, they're stay-at-home bodies.

01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:56.849
ASHLEY: She didn't look very--

01:33:56.849 --> 01:33:59.824
MATT: "Based on the way you've described this individual,

01:33:59.824 --> 01:34:02.804
"and your experiences in Eiselcross,

01:34:02.804 --> 01:34:06.444
"what knowledge I do have and have heard of Aeor,

01:34:06.444 --> 01:34:10.144
"is not welcoming

01:34:10.144 --> 01:34:13.267
"to those of an arcanist's background.

01:34:14.324 --> 01:34:15.344
"I wouldn't be against it,

01:34:15.344 --> 01:34:18.134
"but I'm not as young as I used to be.

01:34:18.134 --> 01:34:20.414
"I have many responsibilities here.

01:34:20.414 --> 01:34:24.774
"And to be honest, I may be of more aid here,

01:34:24.774 --> 01:34:27.154
"acquiring attention and interest

01:34:27.154 --> 01:34:28.984
"to what it is you're doing.

01:34:28.984 --> 01:34:31.774
"If what you're attempting fails,

01:34:31.774 --> 01:34:34.204
"and nobody knows or is ready of what may come through,

01:34:34.204 --> 01:34:37.524
"then everything crumbles.

01:34:37.524 --> 01:34:40.817
"I think I may be of more use in trying to,

01:34:41.824 --> 01:34:44.487
"to gather others, to convince,

01:34:45.904 --> 01:34:47.724
"I don't know, members of this council,

01:34:47.724 --> 01:34:50.824
"convincing people from across the seas to be of aid

01:34:50.824 --> 01:34:53.124
"and to be ready in case what you're attempting

01:34:54.414 --> 01:34:55.989
"doesn't come to pass."

01:34:55.989 --> 01:34:57.074
LAURA: Who all is on the council?

01:34:57.074 --> 01:34:58.556
ASHLEY: I wonder if it should be put--

01:34:58.556 --> 01:35:00.424
MATT: "Maybe one day you'll meet them."

01:35:00.424 --> 01:35:02.874
ASHLEY: Maybe we should go talk to the council?

01:35:02.874 --> 01:35:05.801
SAM: Maybe we should at least go see them.

01:35:05.801 --> 01:35:07.744
ASHLEY: And make our plea.

01:35:07.744 --> 01:35:10.334
MATT: "I say this--"
SAM: I like that idea, Yasha.

01:35:10.334 --> 01:35:11.334
MATT: "I appreciate that.

01:35:12.354 --> 01:35:16.324
"Bureaucracy requires a gentle touch

01:35:16.324 --> 01:35:19.124
"and I say this with respect.

01:35:19.124 --> 01:35:22.244
"You are all a bit scattered and blunt

01:35:22.244 --> 01:35:23.406
"and rough on the edges."

01:35:23.406 --> 01:35:25.180
TRAVIS: No.
MATT: "You remind me of

01:35:25.180 --> 01:35:27.127
"a number of folks I've met in the past.

01:35:29.664 --> 01:35:31.414
"Besides, time is of the essence.

01:35:32.564 --> 01:35:33.764
"Let me see what I can do

01:35:33.764 --> 01:35:36.564
"and I can be in contact with you for as long

01:35:36.564 --> 01:35:39.274
"as we're able to be in contact."

01:35:39.274 --> 01:35:42.164
LIAM: And you spoke of ways to deal

01:35:42.164 --> 01:35:44.794
with creatures like beholders.

01:35:44.794 --> 01:35:45.627
You said--
MATT: "Yes,"

01:35:45.627 --> 01:35:46.797
and at this point you hear the

01:35:46.797 --> 01:35:48.197
(sharp footsteps)

01:35:48.197 --> 01:35:51.514
and you watch us Kima comes down the stairs in full armor.

01:35:51.514 --> 01:35:52.594
TRAVIS: Oh!
SAM: Shit.

01:35:52.594 --> 01:35:54.098
MATT: Like, blade on the shoulder.

01:35:54.098 --> 01:35:56.794
TRAVIS: Oh, I misjudged you, I'm so--

01:35:56.794 --> 01:36:00.244
MATT: (as Kima) "Look, if you've all
brought any of this dark shit into our home!

01:36:00.244 --> 01:36:02.900
LIAM: I step behind Jester.

01:36:02.900 --> 01:36:05.894
TRAVIS: That is an amazing weapon you are wielding.

01:36:05.894 --> 01:36:07.964
What is that?

01:36:07.964 --> 01:36:10.124
MARISHA: Check out that armor.

01:36:10.124 --> 01:36:12.194
MATT: "Thank you."
MARISHA: What's that made of?

01:36:12.194 --> 01:36:13.214
MATT: "It's made of metal."

01:36:13.214 --> 01:36:15.066
(laughter)

01:36:15.066 --> 01:36:19.681
ASHLEY: Is that also a Vestige?

01:36:19.681 --> 01:36:22.194
TRAVIS: Oh, do you wield a Vestige of Divergence as well?

01:36:22.194 --> 01:36:23.027
MATT: "Totally."

01:36:24.801 --> 01:36:25.664
TALIESIN: Insight check?

01:36:25.664 --> 01:36:28.074
MATT: Insight check.
(laughter)

01:36:28.074 --> 01:36:28.914
TALIESIN: 17.

01:36:28.914 --> 01:36:30.114
MATT: Huh? Nah.

01:36:30.114 --> 01:36:31.784
She's totally lying.

01:36:31.784 --> 01:36:32.977
TRAVIS: Is that platinum?

01:36:33.984 --> 01:36:35.444
MATT: "Parts of it are platinum, yeah."

01:36:35.444 --> 01:36:39.302
TRAVIS: The sword is platinum!
MARISHA: That is so fucking expensive, dude!

01:36:40.554 --> 01:36:42.554
MATT: "It's also functional.

01:36:42.554 --> 01:36:44.334
"I didn't come here for an interrogation.

01:36:44.334 --> 01:36:45.794
"Who the hell do you think you are anyway?"

01:36:45.794 --> 01:36:48.174
TRAVIS: Oh, no, we're just admiring.

01:36:48.174 --> 01:36:50.154
Clearly, your prowess as a warrior.

01:36:50.154 --> 01:36:51.624
MARISHA: Trying to be complimentary.

01:36:51.624 --> 01:36:55.504
SAM: Don't mind them, halfling to halfling, I get it.

01:36:55.504 --> 01:36:57.844
You're a fighter, you're an adventurer.

01:36:57.844 --> 01:37:00.457
That's what's in our halfling blood, right?

01:37:01.764 --> 01:37:02.597
MATT: "Yeah."

01:37:02.597 --> 01:37:04.734
SAM: Yeah! Back off!

01:37:04.734 --> 01:37:05.984
MATT: "Thank you."

01:37:05.984 --> 01:37:07.624
TRAVIS: Sorry.

01:37:07.624 --> 01:37:09.884
MATT: Sets the blade at the side.

01:37:09.884 --> 01:37:11.067
Allura goes--

01:37:11.067 --> 01:37:12.684
SAM: She's so cool!
MARISHA: She's so cool!

01:37:12.684 --> 01:37:15.479
MATT: "Kima, it's all right. They are--

01:37:16.634 --> 01:37:21.368
"They are on the path to an extremely dangerous,

01:37:23.194 --> 01:37:27.194
"if opportune,

01:37:27.194 --> 01:37:29.977
"climactic struggle."

01:37:31.629 --> 01:37:33.774
Kima gives a look.

01:37:33.774 --> 01:37:37.236
"Oh I-- I'm sorry.

01:37:37.236 --> 01:37:39.194
"I just thought you were a bunch of yahoos

01:37:39.194 --> 01:37:42.554
"that ruined our morning to sleep in."

01:37:42.554 --> 01:37:45.045
MARISHA: I mean, they're not mutually exclusive, yeah.

01:37:45.045 --> 01:37:46.364
TALIESIN: Both of those really describe us.

01:37:46.364 --> 01:37:50.854
MATT: "And I also respect you accepting the truth, okay."

01:37:50.854 --> 01:37:54.504
Allura turns to Kima and says,

01:37:54.504 --> 01:37:59.144
"There are some things afoot far to the east of us,"

01:37:59.144 --> 01:38:01.164
and she begins to speak and you all

01:38:01.164 --> 01:38:04.544
chime in and inform Kima of, in a much more succinct way,

01:38:04.544 --> 01:38:08.686
the weight of the dangers you're facing and the--

01:38:08.686 --> 01:38:12.427
this Cognouza, this living city

01:38:12.427 --> 01:38:15.784
that draws ever closer and ever hungrier,

01:38:15.784 --> 01:38:19.674
as its distant protégé in the Nonagon

01:38:19.674 --> 01:38:22.564
seeks to open the doors to bring it back into the space,

01:38:22.564 --> 01:38:23.864
and whatever that entails.

01:38:30.079 --> 01:38:31.562
Kima goes like, "Well,

01:38:35.232 --> 01:38:36.732
"how confident are you feeling?"

01:38:37.894 --> 01:38:38.854
SAM: Us?

01:38:38.854 --> 01:38:40.384
TALIESIN: Wow!

01:38:40.384 --> 01:38:41.418
Not--
SAM: Us?

01:38:41.418 --> 01:38:42.767
Not at all.
LAURA: We'll give it our all,

01:38:42.767 --> 01:38:43.600
you know?

01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:45.164
TALIESIN: Well, it's not been going great so far.

01:38:45.164 --> 01:38:48.267
MARISHA: We already went hand-to-hand with these guys, so.

01:38:49.434 --> 01:38:50.834
SAM: They beat us pretty good.

01:38:50.834 --> 01:38:52.304
MARISHA: We know what we're up against.

01:38:52.304 --> 01:38:54.294
LIAM: We were exhausted, but even still--

01:38:54.294 --> 01:38:56.617
LAURA: We were so exhausted.
SAM: They were, too!

01:38:56.617 --> 01:38:58.451
LIAM: Even still.
TRAVIS: They don't sleep.

01:38:58.451 --> 01:39:00.464
LIAM: Yeah, but they were holding back when we were dealing

01:39:00.464 --> 01:39:03.659
with the ancient white dragon.

01:39:03.659 --> 01:39:05.904
TALIESIN: If only there was a way to get more residuum.

01:39:07.195 --> 01:39:10.195
(laughter)

01:39:11.159 --> 01:39:12.042
Sorry, had to.

01:39:12.042 --> 01:39:15.984
MATT: Kima sits over on one side of her armored leg

01:39:15.984 --> 01:39:18.651
and looks to Allura and goes,

01:39:18.651 --> 01:39:22.287
"I mean, do you think--?"

01:39:22.287 --> 01:39:24.544
And Allura goes, "(chuckling)

01:39:24.544 --> 01:39:26.384
"No, I'm not losing you again."

01:39:26.384 --> 01:39:29.364
LAURA: (gasping)

01:39:29.364 --> 01:39:31.337
MATT: "If this encroaches anywhere,

01:39:33.364 --> 01:39:36.174
"<i>anywhere</i> in danger beyond what they're attempting,

01:39:36.174 --> 01:39:38.761
"then yes, but

01:39:40.804 --> 01:39:45.803
"we've seen others like them do great things."

01:39:49.364 --> 01:39:51.494
LAURA: They're real dangerous, we're real scared,

01:39:51.494 --> 01:39:53.291
we're real-- it's pretty dangerous.

01:39:53.291 --> 01:39:56.181
TRAVIS: ♪ Sure could use a sword made out of platinum ♪

01:39:56.181 --> 01:39:58.832
(laughter)

01:39:58.832 --> 01:40:01.701
LIAM: ♪ I feel like platinum tonight,
like platinum tonight ♪

01:40:01.701 --> 01:40:03.508
MATT: (laughs) Do you actually say anything about it?

01:40:03.508 --> 01:40:04.836
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MATT: What are you saying?

01:40:04.836 --> 01:40:06.163
TRAVIS: What, what?

01:40:06.163 --> 01:40:07.800
LIAM: What, what?
TRAVIS: No, I say that out loud.

01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:09.264
MATT: You say that?
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah.

01:40:09.264 --> 01:40:10.584
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

01:40:10.584 --> 01:40:12.794
(laughter)

01:40:12.794 --> 01:40:15.034
TRAVIS: What the hell's my persuasion?

01:40:15.034 --> 01:40:16.061
SAM: We did just beat a dragon, by the way.

01:40:16.061 --> 01:40:17.454
LAURA: No.
TALIESIN: Of course you did.

01:40:17.454 --> 01:40:18.974
MARISHA: Did you?

01:40:18.974 --> 01:40:19.900
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

01:40:19.900 --> 01:40:23.259
(cheering)

01:40:23.259 --> 01:40:24.467
TALIESIN: Where have these rolls been?

01:40:24.467 --> 01:40:25.792
MATT: You guys are ridiculous tonight!

01:40:25.792 --> 01:40:27.672
LIAM: Where were they

01:40:27.672 --> 01:40:29.924
when we were with the Nonagon?!

01:40:29.924 --> 01:40:32.216
LAURA: When we all rolled like absolute dogshit?

01:40:32.216 --> 01:40:33.049
LIAM: Jeez!

01:40:33.049 --> 01:40:33.882
MATT: A total of?

01:40:33.882 --> 01:40:34.715
TRAVIS: 25.

01:40:35.897 --> 01:40:40.642
MATT: Kima give you a look and goes (scoffs).

01:40:40.642 --> 01:40:45.501
Allura goes, "Well, let's see what we can muster to help.

01:40:45.501 --> 01:40:46.334
Allura goes, "Well, let's see what we can muster to help.

01:40:47.444 --> 01:40:48.324
"We'll be right back."

01:40:48.324 --> 01:40:51.544
And they go ahead and make their way up the staircase

01:40:51.544 --> 01:40:52.954
and you could hear like talking and whispering

01:40:52.954 --> 01:40:54.584
as they head up there and you all are left there

01:40:54.584 --> 01:40:56.314
with the tea set and your snacks,

01:40:56.314 --> 01:40:59.564
for a bit to discuss amongst yourselves.

01:40:59.564 --> 01:41:01.494
LIAM: If you have any stray pieces of amber,

01:41:01.494 --> 01:41:02.994
that would be welcome as well.

01:41:03.874 --> 01:41:05.105
TALIESIN: Residuum, I really wasn't--

01:41:05.105 --> 01:41:07.588
TRAVIS: (mumbled) Residuum.

01:41:07.588 --> 01:41:09.683
That tea is alcoholic kombucha.

01:41:09.683 --> 01:41:11.534
SAM: This is a really nice rug.

01:41:11.534 --> 01:41:13.344
LIAM: That is African yogurt.

01:41:13.344 --> 01:41:14.177
TRAVIS: A real nice what?

01:41:14.177 --> 01:41:15.080
Rug?
SAM: Rug.

01:41:15.080 --> 01:41:18.467
(laughter)

01:41:18.467 --> 01:41:20.317
SAM: Should we just like look under it?

01:41:20.317 --> 01:41:21.150
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:41:21.150 --> 01:41:22.623
TRAVIS: Is there a rug?
MARISHA: Kind of pick it up.

01:41:22.623 --> 01:41:23.456
MATT: Yeah, there's a rug.

01:41:23.456 --> 01:41:25.334
LAURA: We're sitting on a rug.
LIAM: Central carpet.

01:41:25.334 --> 01:41:26.924
LAURA: You have Detect Magic?

01:41:26.924 --> 01:41:28.654
TALIESIN: I do.
LIAM: I do, I cast it.

01:41:28.654 --> 01:41:30.014
MATT: You cast it?
LIAM: Yeah.

01:41:30.014 --> 01:41:31.026
MATT: The carpet is not magic.

01:41:31.026 --> 01:41:34.004
TRAVIS: (screaming) Fly up [inaudible].

01:41:34.004 --> 01:41:35.204
MATT: It was at one time.

01:41:35.204 --> 01:41:36.624
LIAM: I wish you had just taken it,

01:41:36.624 --> 01:41:37.764
and jumped out a window with it.

01:41:37.764 --> 01:41:40.785
(laughter)

01:41:40.785 --> 01:41:43.601
SAM: Still could, flying squirrel.

01:41:43.601 --> 01:41:46.451
(laughter)

01:41:46.451 --> 01:41:48.011
Still could.

01:41:48.011 --> 01:41:48.963
MATT: I don't get it.

01:41:48.963 --> 01:41:51.944
I don't get it, in the last game this was a magical item.

01:41:51.944 --> 01:41:53.444
It's just like playing the sequel of a video game,

01:41:53.444 --> 01:41:54.627
and they've just changed things.

01:41:54.627 --> 01:41:55.460
You're like, "Fuck!"

01:41:55.460 --> 01:41:57.574
TRAVIS: Is there a window or a door,

01:41:57.574 --> 01:41:58.795
at the level that we're at,

01:41:58.795 --> 01:42:01.284
that we could just like see if it's dark outside?

01:42:01.284 --> 01:42:04.314
MATT: No, it's lit well inside, but you get the sense

01:42:04.314 --> 01:42:06.624
that a lot of the like the white-colored stone

01:42:06.624 --> 01:42:07.534
that this tower's made out of,

01:42:07.534 --> 01:42:09.924
it's giving off a faint interior light in keeping it,

01:42:09.924 --> 01:42:11.474
it feels like a warm daylight,

01:42:11.474 --> 01:42:12.754
but there's no window currently.

01:42:12.754 --> 01:42:15.427
LAURA: Does it look like it's made out of ivory

01:42:15.427 --> 01:42:18.097
or just white stone?
MATT: It's hard to see at this distance,

01:42:18.097 --> 01:42:19.945
so you can go ahead and inspect it closer, if you'd like?

01:42:19.945 --> 01:42:21.611
LAURA: Yes.
MATT: Okay.

01:42:21.611 --> 01:42:22.444
Make an investigation check for me.

01:42:22.444 --> 01:42:23.434
LIAM: Paint a new window.

01:42:23.434 --> 01:42:24.484
I want to see Emon.

01:42:27.334 --> 01:42:30.094
LAURA: I was adopting your method, did you see?

01:42:30.094 --> 01:42:31.763
SAM: I did, you did it a little weird.

01:42:31.763 --> 01:42:32.764
(laughter)

01:42:32.764 --> 01:42:34.764
You did like this backspin thing.

01:42:34.764 --> 01:42:35.995
LAURA: I want to see if his method--

01:42:35.995 --> 01:42:38.424
ah, his method would have been so much better!

01:42:38.424 --> 01:42:39.694
I got a 12.

01:42:39.694 --> 01:42:40.527
MATT: 12.

01:42:41.474 --> 01:42:43.697
LAURA: With Sam's method, though, I got a 20.

01:42:43.697 --> 01:42:44.530
SAM: The Sam method.

01:42:44.530 --> 01:42:45.954
MATT: Well, you're not Sam, unfortunately,

01:42:45.954 --> 01:42:47.869
so the method doesn't work for you.

01:42:47.869 --> 01:42:50.107
TRAVIS: Doesn't work for him, either.
MATT: Inspecting it, it's--

01:42:51.614 --> 01:42:53.124
it's porous in a very small scale,

01:42:53.124 --> 01:42:54.444
but overall fairly smooth.

01:42:54.444 --> 01:42:56.694
You don't have a lot of familiar with stone masonry,

01:42:56.694 --> 01:42:58.504
so you're not quite sure of the material, unfortunately.

01:42:58.504 --> 01:43:00.157
LAURA: Yeah, that make sense.
MATT: But it's well-made.

01:43:01.404 --> 01:43:02.237
TALIESIN: What--?

01:43:02.237 --> 01:43:03.894
MATT: But-- what?

01:43:03.894 --> 01:43:04.784
TALIESIN: I was just curious.

01:43:04.784 --> 01:43:09.454
Where would masonry fall on the skill chart?

01:43:09.454 --> 01:43:10.994
MATT: I would consider it an investigation check,

01:43:10.994 --> 01:43:14.384
and then people like dwarves, who have a natural ability

01:43:14.384 --> 01:43:16.393
to inspect stone masonry with possibly an advantage--

01:43:16.393 --> 01:43:19.544
TALIESIN: People that grew up with lots of stone work.

01:43:19.544 --> 01:43:21.077
That make sense.

01:43:21.077 --> 01:43:22.544
MATT: After a brief period of time,

01:43:22.544 --> 01:43:25.204
you hear the familiar clack of armored boots

01:43:25.204 --> 01:43:27.734
and you watch as Kima and Allura once more

01:43:27.734 --> 01:43:29.184
descend down the stairs.

01:43:29.184 --> 01:43:32.864
Allura using this beautiful-looking,

01:43:32.864 --> 01:43:34.814
almost similar ivory staff,

01:43:34.814 --> 01:43:37.144
that looks similar to the tower of which she resides,

01:43:37.144 --> 01:43:40.074
with a silver design and scrolls across it

01:43:40.074 --> 01:43:41.967
and some hanging threads and ribbons.

01:43:43.444 --> 01:43:48.444
And a, just like a simple satchel, a sack of some kind.

01:43:49.658 --> 01:43:52.964
As she approaches, she puts her hand out

01:43:52.964 --> 01:43:55.189
and you watch as the tray shifts itself off to the side

01:43:55.189 --> 01:43:57.444
and sets down, and she places this satchel onto the table,

01:43:57.444 --> 01:44:00.394
it opens slightly and you can see some things inside of it.

01:44:01.554 --> 01:44:04.035
"Hopefully these will be of aid."

01:44:04.035 --> 01:44:05.718
LAURA: It's like Winter's Crest!

01:44:05.718 --> 01:44:10.718
MATT: "Yeah, it's based on what you had been speaking of,"

01:44:10.804 --> 01:44:12.544
and she reaches in and pulls out

01:44:13.824 --> 01:44:16.404
this circular sphere device

01:44:16.404 --> 01:44:20.257
that has a bunch of deeply set grooves and runes across it.

01:44:21.129 --> 01:44:23.694
"You had mentioned this field,

01:44:23.694 --> 01:44:27.884
"these were used in the hunting of beholders

01:44:27.884 --> 01:44:29.544
"and other such creatures.

01:44:29.544 --> 01:44:32.617
"They're referred to as an Arcane Field Generator."

01:44:34.634 --> 01:44:36.164
SAM: Who's writing this down?

01:44:36.164 --> 01:44:37.092
LAURA: I'm writing it.

01:44:37.092 --> 01:44:39.044
TRAVIS: What?
MATT: And there are two of them.

01:44:39.044 --> 01:44:41.314
"They're very rare to find,

01:44:41.314 --> 01:44:44.324
"not many people know how to make them

01:44:44.324 --> 01:44:48.919
"and these, I acquired by some friends in Vasselheim,

01:44:48.919 --> 01:44:50.684
"a number of years back.

01:44:50.684 --> 01:44:53.184
"They're prone to hunting such dangerous creatures.

01:44:54.444 --> 01:44:57.147
"But when activated, it creates a--

01:44:58.634 --> 01:45:00.576
"how best can I describe it?

01:45:00.576 --> 01:45:03.934
"Are any of you familiar with such spell work

01:45:03.934 --> 01:45:05.774
"as the Faerie Fire spell?"

01:45:05.774 --> 01:45:07.544
TRAVIS: Oh, yes.
SAM: Yes.

01:45:07.544 --> 01:45:09.144
MATT: "A similar visual perspective.

01:45:09.144 --> 01:45:13.684
"It fills a space with gently floating arcane motes.

01:45:13.684 --> 01:45:17.374
"No physical effect, but it just fills it

01:45:17.374 --> 01:45:22.007
"with these small, glowing, bobbing bits.

01:45:23.124 --> 01:45:27.984
"Anything that negates magic in that field is easy to spot

01:45:27.984 --> 01:45:29.564
"within its positioning."

01:45:29.564 --> 01:45:30.744
LAURA: Oh, wow!

01:45:30.744 --> 01:45:33.634
SAM: So you can see where the magic is negated?

01:45:33.634 --> 01:45:35.530
It doesn't counteract the negation?

01:45:35.530 --> 01:45:36.774
MATT: "No."

01:45:36.774 --> 01:45:39.154
LAURA: But you can attack within that spot?
MATT: "But it shows where it is.

01:45:39.154 --> 01:45:42.174
"Indeed, and for those that were hunting beings

01:45:42.174 --> 01:45:45.007
"with such similar capabilities, these were essential."

01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:49.834
SAM: Does it last a while or just a few minutes?

01:45:49.834 --> 01:45:52.344
MATT: Let me pull that up real fast, double check.

01:45:52.344 --> 01:45:53.177
LAURA: That's cool.

01:45:53.177 --> 01:45:54.010
TALIESIN: Six seconds.

01:45:55.220 --> 01:45:57.574
(laughter)

01:45:57.574 --> 01:45:58.544
MATT: Right.

01:45:58.544 --> 01:46:01.350
(laughter)

01:46:01.350 --> 01:46:02.773
TRAVIS: It's like a firework.
TALIESIN: This is like a

01:46:02.773 --> 01:46:04.694
smoke bomb in the laser field.

01:46:04.694 --> 01:46:06.597
MATT: Kind of, yeah.

01:46:07.514 --> 01:46:09.949
"Remains suspended for one hour."

01:46:09.949 --> 01:46:11.032
ALL: Whoa!

01:46:12.654 --> 01:46:15.014
MATT: "But it cannot be used again until the next dawn."

01:46:15.014 --> 01:46:15.847
LAURA: Okay.

01:46:15.847 --> 01:46:18.436
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Oh, they're reusable!

01:46:18.436 --> 01:46:19.269
LAURA: Tight!

01:46:19.269 --> 01:46:21.486
ASHLEY: And there's two?
MATT: "Two of them, yes."

01:46:21.486 --> 01:46:23.954
TRAVIS: This is a handsome gift.
MARISHA: Yes, it is.

01:46:23.954 --> 01:46:26.074
LIAM: How wide an area do each of them cover?

01:46:26.074 --> 01:46:27.215
MATT: "100-foot radius."

01:46:27.215 --> 01:46:29.718
(screaming)

01:46:29.718 --> 01:46:32.574
TRAVIS: ♪ Oh, we're unstoppable now ♪

01:46:32.574 --> 01:46:34.464
TALIESIN: Do you have to attune them?

01:46:34.464 --> 01:46:35.375
MATT: No.

01:46:35.375 --> 01:46:36.352
(cheering)

01:46:36.352 --> 01:46:38.261
LIAM: ♪ Simply the best ♪
TRAVIS: Fuck!

01:46:38.261 --> 01:46:40.414
MATT: "But each time they are used,

01:46:40.414 --> 01:46:42.181
"there is a chance that they will--"

01:46:42.181 --> 01:46:43.244
TRAVIS: Kill you?

01:46:43.244 --> 01:46:47.004
MATT: "No, but they will become inert thereafter.

01:46:47.004 --> 01:46:49.244
"And these have seen some use in the past,

01:46:49.244 --> 01:46:52.274
"so be aware, I'm not entirely certain

01:46:52.274 --> 01:46:54.844
"how reliable they might be on excessive use.

01:46:54.844 --> 01:46:56.334
"But hopefully this should aid,

"should you encounter this individual again.

01:46:57.939 --> 01:46:59.141
SAM: Yes!
LAURA: Oh my gosh!

01:46:59.141 --> 01:47:01.317
How long does it take to turn them on?

01:47:02.574 --> 01:47:04.504
MATT: "An action," is the determined.

01:47:04.504 --> 01:47:05.717
SAM: What is an action?

01:47:05.717 --> 01:47:06.704
(laughter)

01:47:06.704 --> 01:47:10.121
MATT: "Activity utilizing it."
You know what the fuck I mean.

01:47:11.171 --> 01:47:13.204
"But it creates a low light in the area, too,

01:47:13.204 --> 01:47:16.116
"so in pitch darkness, it does light the space a bit."

01:47:16.116 --> 01:47:18.584
LAURA: This sounds wonderful.
SAM: This is the best.

01:47:18.584 --> 01:47:19.892
Thank you!
LAURA: I'm just going to turn on

01:47:19.892 --> 01:47:21.275
when I'm in my room tonight.
TRAVIS: What do we owe you

01:47:21.275 --> 01:47:22.925
for these items? This is--
MARISHA: Yeah, it's a galaxy lamp.

01:47:22.925 --> 01:47:25.394
MATT: "These will be somewhat helpful,

01:47:25.394 --> 01:47:27.413
"not much, based on what you're going against.

01:47:27.413 --> 01:47:28.771
"Are you intending--

01:47:30.022 --> 01:47:32.564
"You're intending to go into these ruins of Aeor?"

01:47:32.564 --> 01:47:34.664
LAURA: We have to.
SAM: That's where the baddies are going, so.

01:47:34.664 --> 01:47:36.761
MATT: "But here's my question."
SAM: We'd like to.

01:47:37.844 --> 01:47:41.874
MATT: "Should you not stop this Nonagon,

01:47:41.874 --> 01:47:45.304
"and they do indeed complete their journey

01:47:45.304 --> 01:47:46.667
"into the Astral Plane.

01:47:47.734 --> 01:47:48.934
"Do you intend to pursue?"

01:47:49.934 --> 01:47:50.767
TALIESIN: Wow.

01:47:50.767 --> 01:47:53.984
MARISHA: You know, we haven't really gotten that far yet

01:47:53.984 --> 01:47:55.197
in our conversation.

01:47:56.994 --> 01:48:01.424
But it does seem like that's what they're doing, right?

01:48:01.424 --> 01:48:06.404
SAM: Would we be able to breathe there or move?

01:48:07.414 --> 01:48:10.184
LAURA: I mean, we floated in the Astral Sea before.

01:48:10.184 --> 01:48:12.934
MATT: "If you'd been there before,
then you would know, yes."

01:48:13.784 --> 01:48:18.784
LAURA: So my friend, Artagan, he told me about,

01:48:19.224 --> 01:48:21.774
there's this ability that he was teaching me

01:48:21.774 --> 01:48:25.924
that I could transfer between planes, right?

01:48:25.924 --> 01:48:27.604
But apparently in order to do it,

01:48:27.604 --> 01:48:32.115
I have to have some sort of thing tuned to that plane.

01:48:32.115 --> 01:48:34.684
I don't have anything tuned to the Astral Plane.

01:48:34.684 --> 01:48:36.484
I don't know how we would get there.

01:48:38.904 --> 01:48:42.524
MATT: "I've been before, I can provide that.

01:48:42.524 --> 01:48:44.424
"Remind me, what's your friend's name?"

01:48:45.532 --> 01:48:47.637
LAURA: Artagan, the Traveler?

01:48:49.824 --> 01:48:50.807
MATT: "Huh."

01:48:53.654 --> 01:48:55.614
SAM: Are you a follower of the Traveler?

01:48:55.614 --> 01:48:58.118
MATT: "By. No. Means."

01:48:58.118 --> 01:48:59.196
SAM: Oh.
TRAVIS: Oh!

01:48:59.196 --> 01:49:00.029
MATT: "Interesting."

01:49:00.029 --> 01:49:03.024
LAURA: You know Artie?

01:49:03.024 --> 01:49:06.305
MATT: "Not personally, but I've
heard of his exploits before.

01:49:06.305 --> 01:49:08.297
TALIESIN: This is the first time this has ever happened.

01:49:08.297 --> 01:49:10.014
LAURA: Wow!
TRAVIS: He's been very busy.

01:49:10.014 --> 01:49:13.151
LIAM: We never run into anyone, other than on the island.

01:49:13.151 --> 01:49:14.789
LAURA: I mean, yeah.
TRAVIS: Truly.

01:49:14.789 --> 01:49:15.714
LAURA: I mean, he has a bunch of fol--

01:49:15.714 --> 01:49:17.022
he <i>had</i> a bunch of followers

01:49:17.022 --> 01:49:19.264
before the cult broke apart.

01:49:19.264 --> 01:49:21.771
MATT: "Oh, broke apart, that seems par for the course."

01:49:21.771 --> 01:49:22.884
TRAVIS: The Moon Weaver.

01:49:22.884 --> 01:49:26.504
MATT: "Well, regardless, this...

01:49:31.713 --> 01:49:32.754
"Well."

01:49:32.754 --> 01:49:34.284
She gestures to the satchel,

01:49:34.284 --> 01:49:36.242
and pulls out another smaller bag.

01:49:36.242 --> 01:49:37.075
SAM: Oh!

01:49:37.075 --> 01:49:38.861
TRAVIS: There's more?
SAM: More stuff?

01:49:38.861 --> 01:49:42.714
MATT: "For those that requested a bit of residuum."

01:49:42.714 --> 01:49:43.547
(gasping)

01:49:43.547 --> 01:49:46.374
TRAVIS: Oh, ask and you shall receive!

01:49:46.374 --> 01:49:48.401
MATT: There is a pouch of 500 gold worth of residuum.

01:49:48.401 --> 01:49:49.379
(cheering)

01:49:49.379 --> 01:49:52.344
(laughter)

01:49:52.344 --> 01:49:54.022
TALIESIN: I will be--

01:49:54.022 --> 01:49:57.014
I will be so careful with this.

01:49:57.014 --> 01:50:00.474
SAM: The pouch says Whit-stone on it.

01:50:00.474 --> 01:50:01.307
TRAVIS: That's so rare.

01:50:01.307 --> 01:50:04.507
Yes, where did you acquire so much residuum?

01:50:05.744 --> 01:50:08.327
MATT: "There's a racket to the east of here.

01:50:13.963 --> 01:50:16.284
"(sighing)

01:50:16.284 --> 01:50:18.034
"These are things that you may keep."

01:50:20.219 --> 01:50:21.354
SAM: What do we owe you?

01:50:21.354 --> 01:50:23.264
TRAVIS: What can we do for you in exchange?

01:50:23.264 --> 01:50:24.504
There must be something.

01:50:24.504 --> 01:50:27.034
MATT: "Well, I know what you look like,

01:50:27.034 --> 01:50:30.874
"we have mutual friends, if you abscond with these,

01:50:30.874 --> 01:50:32.104
"and all of this was a lie,

01:50:32.104 --> 01:50:35.444
"I will find you and punish you with all the strength

01:50:35.444 --> 01:50:37.354
"of the council behind me.

01:50:37.354 --> 01:50:40.714
"So I trust that this is all going to the goodwill

01:50:40.714 --> 01:50:41.774
"of what you're attempting to do

01:50:41.774 --> 01:50:44.214
"for the betterment of Exandria
and all that live within it."

01:50:44.214 --> 01:50:45.404
SAM: Yes.
LAURA: Yeah.

01:50:45.404 --> 01:50:48.427
MATT: "As part of that, I could lend you something."

01:50:49.955 --> 01:50:51.204
And she pauses for a second

01:50:51.204 --> 01:50:52.717
and holds her staff forward.

01:50:53.834 --> 01:50:57.731
Says, "This has been my staff for quite some time.

01:50:57.731 --> 01:50:59.721
"I would very much like to have it back."

01:51:01.954 --> 01:51:02.787
SAM: Wait.

01:51:03.654 --> 01:51:06.304
This is your magical staff?

01:51:06.304 --> 01:51:07.137
MATT: "Yes."

01:51:08.724 --> 01:51:09.914
TALIESIN: May I see it?

01:51:09.914 --> 01:51:13.084
LIAM: You want to send us with it into the Astral Sea?

01:51:13.084 --> 01:51:15.664
MARISHA: We might not come back.

01:51:15.664 --> 01:51:16.974
MATT: "It's served me well in the past.

01:51:16.974 --> 01:51:20.054
"I believe that what you're doing

01:51:20.054 --> 01:51:21.904
"is important enough to play the risk."

01:51:22.757 --> 01:51:23.590
LAURA: Wow!

01:51:23.590 --> 01:51:26.704
TALIESIN: Do you want to hang onto mine, maybe?

01:51:26.704 --> 01:51:28.045
MATT: "What, as a collateral?"

01:51:28.045 --> 01:51:30.128
(laughs)

01:51:32.114 --> 01:51:33.724
TALIESIN: Pull my crystal off, and--

01:51:33.724 --> 01:51:36.516
LAURA: Yeah, be careful, a lot of beetles live in his.

01:51:36.516 --> 01:51:37.653
MATT: "I'm good, thank you."

01:51:37.653 --> 01:51:40.653
(laughter)

01:51:42.934 --> 01:51:43.767
"Leave it where you must,

01:51:43.767 --> 01:51:45.034
"just beyond the walls of the tower, though,

01:51:45.034 --> 01:51:46.244
"if you don't mind."

01:51:46.244 --> 01:51:48.624
TALIESIN: No problem. This is, wow.

01:51:48.624 --> 01:51:50.074
LIAM: I could tinker with it later,

01:51:50.074 --> 01:51:51.687
but what is the nature of this?

01:51:54.704 --> 01:51:58.621
MATT: "Well," she looks you keen in the eyes.

01:52:01.074 --> 01:52:02.874
"I think you'll ascertain its nature."

01:52:06.217 --> 01:52:07.844
LIAM: Surprises.

01:52:07.844 --> 01:52:10.234
TRAVIS: This is most generous,

01:52:10.234 --> 01:52:13.132
surely we will be on our way to meet a fate

01:52:13.132 --> 01:52:16.304
and a fight that will be-- and I look to Kima--

01:52:16.304 --> 01:52:19.067
told throughout the ages.

01:52:20.254 --> 01:52:21.914
We shall either be remembered forever,

01:52:21.914 --> 01:52:26.094
or forgotten swiftly, an event not to be missed.

01:52:26.094 --> 01:52:27.698
Thank you, Allura.

01:52:27.698 --> 01:52:29.884
(laughter)

01:52:29.884 --> 01:52:32.134
MATT: Kima sits there and goes,

01:52:34.314 --> 01:52:37.027
"Well, you're the one standing there
with a fucking Vestige, what?"

01:52:37.027 --> 01:52:38.852
(laughter)

01:52:38.852 --> 01:52:40.777
TRAVIS: What, this? (humming)

01:52:42.124 --> 01:52:42.957
MATT: "Yeah.

01:52:45.864 --> 01:52:47.544
"But look, if we're lending stuff,"

01:52:47.544 --> 01:52:49.443
and Kima walks up towards Yasha.

01:52:49.443 --> 01:52:52.835
TRAVIS: Oh, let's go!

01:52:55.847 --> 01:52:56.797
MATT: "I don't know you."

01:52:58.574 --> 01:52:59.407
ASHLEY: Fair.

01:53:01.034 --> 01:53:02.394
MATT: "But I like your style."

01:53:02.394 --> 01:53:03.514
ASHLEY: Oh, thanks.

01:53:03.514 --> 01:53:04.814
SAM: Really stylish.

01:53:04.814 --> 01:53:07.604
MATT: "And to be fair, I don't think
he could lift this, so."

01:53:07.604 --> 01:53:09.307
ASHLEY: Probably true. I don't know what it is,

01:53:09.307 --> 01:53:11.314
but I imagine he wouldn't be able to.

01:53:11.314 --> 01:53:12.784
MATT: She takes a moment

01:53:12.784 --> 01:53:16.941
and looks back at Allura.

01:53:21.074 --> 01:53:23.376
"If you go out there and get killed and don't come back.

01:53:23.376 --> 01:53:25.129
"I'm going to find you and I'm going to kill you."

01:53:26.384 --> 01:53:27.804
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:53:27.804 --> 01:53:31.374
MATT: She hands you the handle of the blade.

01:53:31.374 --> 01:53:32.594
TRAVIS: The platinum greatsword?

01:53:32.594 --> 01:53:33.744
MATT: Mm-hmm.

01:53:35.614 --> 01:53:37.134
ASHLEY: Really?

01:53:37.134 --> 01:53:38.804
LAURA: What does it do? What is it?

01:53:38.804 --> 01:53:41.317
ASHLEY: Can I give it some swings?

01:53:41.317 --> 01:53:42.150
MATT: "Yeah."

01:53:42.150 --> 01:53:43.764
TRAVIS: Back up, back up, back up.

01:53:43.764 --> 01:53:45.645
MATT: Everyone's like "Whoa, whoa, whoa!"

01:53:45.645 --> 01:53:47.680
LAURA: Don't throw this one, Yasha!

01:53:47.680 --> 01:53:49.524
ASHLEY: No, this stays in my hand the whole time.

01:53:49.524 --> 01:53:52.914
MATT: Surprisingly lightweight, extremely well-balanced.

01:53:52.914 --> 01:53:55.094
But when you swing it, the weight adjusts

01:53:55.094 --> 01:53:56.574
and shifts to the tip of the blade

01:53:56.574 --> 01:53:58.274
to give it even a stronger cut.

01:53:58.274 --> 01:54:00.034
And for some reason, even just holding it,

01:54:00.034 --> 01:54:01.504
you feel a little more confident.

01:54:01.504 --> 01:54:03.564
ASHLEY: Wow, this is balanced so well.

01:54:03.564 --> 01:54:05.564
MATT: "Right, I said don't lose it, okay?"

01:54:05.564 --> 01:54:08.597
ASHLEY: I will not. Can I loan you one of mine,

01:54:09.604 --> 01:54:10.484
so you have something?

01:54:10.484 --> 01:54:11.824
MATT: "Yes, please, that'd be great."

01:54:11.824 --> 01:54:13.797
ASHLEY: Okay, take your pick.

01:54:14.874 --> 01:54:16.837
Magician's Judge or Skingorger?

01:54:17.794 --> 01:54:19.244
MATT: She looks at them and goes,

01:54:20.754 --> 01:54:22.324
"Skingorger, really?"

01:54:22.324 --> 01:54:23.397
ASHLEY: I didn't name it.

01:54:23.397 --> 01:54:24.230
MATT: "Okay."

01:54:24.230 --> 01:54:25.905
(laughter)

01:54:28.524 --> 01:54:29.651
"Does look pretty cool, though."

01:54:29.651 --> 01:54:31.334
And Allura goes like, "Kima,

01:54:31.334 --> 01:54:33.449
"I don't want that in the tower."

01:54:33.449 --> 01:54:35.085
(laughter)

01:54:35.085 --> 01:54:37.572
Kima goes, "(sighs) I'll take the Judge."

01:54:39.714 --> 01:54:41.244
ASHLEY: Wow.

01:54:41.244 --> 01:54:43.891
MATT: You can see as you're holding it, she's like--

01:54:43.891 --> 01:54:46.091
ASHLEY: I'll take such good care of it, I promise.

01:54:47.184 --> 01:54:48.224
MATT: "Look, I haven't used it in years.

01:54:48.224 --> 01:54:50.694
"So at the very least, maybe it'll find some use

01:54:50.694 --> 01:54:51.654
"in your hands."

01:54:51.654 --> 01:54:54.101
ASHLEY: In my hands, it will find some use.

01:54:54.101 --> 01:54:55.388
LAURA: She cleans her blades--
MATT: "You sure I can't go with them?"

01:54:55.388 --> 01:54:56.580
LAURA: -- every single night.

01:54:56.580 --> 01:54:57.592
MATT: Allura goes,

01:54:57.592 --> 01:55:00.493
"Kima, please, just stay with me."

01:55:02.484 --> 01:55:04.001
LIAM: Somewhere during all the last two minutes

01:55:04.001 --> 01:55:06.150
of conversation of swords and staffs and stuff,

01:55:06.150 --> 01:55:09.514
I nudge Veth and Jester,

01:55:09.514 --> 01:55:12.957
and I surreptitiously pull a celebone out of my bag,

01:55:14.004 --> 01:55:17.011
and place it on the moving side table.

01:55:17.011 --> 01:55:19.094
LAURA and SAM: (laugh)

01:55:19.974 --> 01:55:20.917
SAM: Nice.

01:55:22.854 --> 01:55:24.879
MATT: "Well, friends,

01:55:26.895 --> 01:55:31.003
"I'll begin to reach out to my various allies and contacts

01:55:31.003 --> 01:55:33.697
"to inform them of the prospective danger.

01:55:35.014 --> 01:55:37.627
"They'll be made aware of what you're doing,

01:55:37.627 --> 01:55:42.434
"and begin contemplating and deciding how best to prepare

01:55:42.434 --> 01:55:44.434
"in case things do not go as you planned.

01:55:45.614 --> 01:55:48.614
"If you require our aid in the interim,

01:55:48.614 --> 01:55:49.897
"you know how to reach me."

01:55:51.654 --> 01:55:52.874
LAURA: Tuning fork?

01:55:52.874 --> 01:55:54.517
MATT: "Oh, yes, yes!

01:55:56.824 --> 01:56:00.094
"Right," and she puts her hand out, and in this flash

01:56:00.094 --> 01:56:05.004
you see this oddly, almost invisible,
translucent shape appear

01:56:05.004 --> 01:56:07.216
on the ground before, solidifying with color, (thuds)

01:56:07.216 --> 01:56:09.524
a mysterious chest appears

01:56:09.524 --> 01:56:11.044
where there was none in front of her.

01:56:11.044 --> 01:56:13.524
She tips her hand up and it opens up,

01:56:13.524 --> 01:56:17.444
and on the inside you can see an exquisitely laid out

01:56:17.444 --> 01:56:21.216
collection of various spell components, odd objects,

01:56:21.216 --> 01:56:23.814
just an array of all things that a mage might need.

01:56:23.814 --> 01:56:25.562
You are drooling at this.

01:56:25.562 --> 01:56:27.344
LIAM: There's a lot.

01:56:27.344 --> 01:56:30.365
MATT: She bends down and begins to pick through.

01:56:30.365 --> 01:56:31.198
"Ah."

01:56:31.198 --> 01:56:32.031
LIAM: Ooh, a red one.

01:56:35.564 --> 01:56:38.571
MATT: Pulls out this piece of what looks

01:56:38.571 --> 01:56:42.384
like a dull copper material, this singular rod

01:56:42.384 --> 01:56:46.874
that curves in waves and hands it to you.

01:56:46.874 --> 01:56:49.584
"This is attuned to the Astral Plane.

01:56:49.584 --> 01:56:51.444
"I believe with the magic that you're attempting,

01:56:51.444 --> 01:56:53.434
"this should be what you require."

01:56:53.434 --> 01:56:55.194
LAURA: Thank you very much.

01:56:55.194 --> 01:56:56.344
MATT: "Also, please return that to me.

01:56:56.344 --> 01:56:58.294
"It is a bit difficult to get a hold of."

01:56:58.294 --> 01:56:59.764
LAURA: I can imagine.

01:56:59.764 --> 01:57:00.597
MATT: "Thank you."

01:57:02.084 --> 01:57:04.097
It shuts and vanishes.

01:57:07.764 --> 01:57:10.237
LIAM: We are greatly in your debt, truly.

01:57:12.254 --> 01:57:16.582
MATT: "Well, just don't fail."

01:57:17.864 --> 01:57:19.724
MARISHA: Any last words of wisdom for dealing

01:57:19.724 --> 01:57:21.674
with the Astral Sea if we end up there?

01:57:24.404 --> 01:57:25.237
MATT: "Well,

01:57:26.420 --> 01:57:30.104
"things may look further away than they really are.

01:57:30.104 --> 01:57:32.994
"Things that look close may be long off.

01:57:34.374 --> 01:57:37.574
"You don't need to walk, though you can if you wish,

01:57:37.574 --> 01:57:39.891
"as you glide with but a thought.

01:57:41.464 --> 01:57:44.124
"It's discombobulating.

01:57:44.124 --> 01:57:47.707
"Direction seems to lose meaning within a short time.

01:57:47.707 --> 01:57:51.394
"And many strange and very dangerous creatures

01:57:51.394 --> 01:57:53.654
"lurk through there, feasting on dreams, ideas,

01:57:53.654 --> 01:57:56.877
"and those who physically make this journey.

01:57:58.384 --> 01:57:59.964
"There are creatures that have called it home

01:57:59.964 --> 01:58:01.137
"for quite some time.

01:58:02.004 --> 01:58:05.874
"Some-- keep a keen eye out.

01:58:05.874 --> 01:58:09.907
"If they arrive via ship, and yellowed skin, run."

01:58:11.707 --> 01:58:13.134
MARISHA: What? Ship, skin, what?

01:58:13.134 --> 01:58:16.707
TRAVIS: If they arrive via ship, with yellow skin, run.

01:58:16.707 --> 01:58:18.207
MARISHA: Oh, okay.

01:58:20.724 --> 01:58:21.824
MATT: "And just be careful.

01:58:23.164 --> 01:58:25.904
"If you indeed have this ability to travel there,

01:58:25.904 --> 01:58:28.054
"that means you also have a reason

01:58:28.054 --> 01:58:29.697
"and capability to travel back.

01:58:31.434 --> 01:58:32.764
"That device you hold,

01:58:32.764 --> 01:58:35.364
"and that ability may be your only means of survival."

01:58:39.844 --> 01:58:40.677
LAURA: Okay.

01:58:42.044 --> 01:58:44.524
TRAVIS: Maybe we won't have to go.

01:58:44.524 --> 01:58:45.357
SAM: Yeah.

01:58:45.357 --> 01:58:46.984
MATT: "Here's to hoping."

01:58:46.984 --> 01:58:48.134
TRAVIS: Get them before that.

01:58:49.634 --> 01:58:50.742
MATT: "But once again,

01:58:50.742 --> 01:58:52.942
"time is of the essence, in that regard."

01:58:55.509 --> 01:58:57.534
LIAM: We have about a week to get our affairs in order.

01:58:57.534 --> 01:59:00.104
Probably want to wrap that up in half the time,

01:59:00.104 --> 01:59:01.854
just to be safe, just to be sure.

01:59:01.854 --> 01:59:05.794
And our goal is to cut them off at the pass.

01:59:05.794 --> 01:59:07.477
MATT: "Good."
LIAM: But now, if we fail?

01:59:09.334 --> 01:59:10.363
LAURA: Fail-safe.

01:59:10.363 --> 01:59:12.030
LIAM: Fail-safe.

01:59:16.544 --> 01:59:20.877
MATT: "I wish you all the absolute best of luck.

01:59:23.244 --> 01:59:26.257
"I'm impressed, threefold now."

01:59:30.084 --> 01:59:31.323
TRAVIS: Should we continue on our way

01:59:31.323 --> 01:59:33.744
or should we try and find a tavern for the night

01:59:33.744 --> 01:59:36.336
and, I don't know, magic shop?

01:59:36.336 --> 01:59:37.334
LIAM: It's early morning here,

01:59:37.334 --> 01:59:39.597
but it's quite late for us, I believe.

01:59:41.084 --> 01:59:42.957
Maybe one night here.

01:59:44.704 --> 01:59:46.732
And then Rexxentrum?

01:59:49.574 --> 01:59:51.734
TRAVIS: Astrid, Bright Queen, Ludinus, Trent.

01:59:51.734 --> 01:59:54.374
LAURA: I think we should probably just head back.

01:59:54.374 --> 01:59:55.644
LIAM: Do you?

01:59:55.644 --> 01:59:58.434
LAURA: I mean I would love to explore to the city, but--

01:59:58.434 --> 02:00:01.164
TALIESIN: Time.
LAURA: It's probably not our best.

02:00:01.164 --> 02:00:03.014
SAM: All of while they talk--
LIAM: Well, we don't have to stay here tonight.

02:00:03.014 --> 02:00:07.264
But there are stops before we return to Eiselcross.

02:00:07.264 --> 02:00:08.994
I think that speaking to the Queen

02:00:08.994 --> 02:00:11.504
is a very good idea.

02:00:11.504 --> 02:00:13.944
I think that your idea

02:00:15.654 --> 02:00:20.414
to see if my old school mates would be willing to procure

02:00:21.656 --> 02:00:24.919
more of those, which is not beyond comprehension.

02:00:26.124 --> 02:00:28.214
If we could go totally incognito

02:00:28.214 --> 02:00:31.467
for the rest of the week, that is worth another two days.

02:00:33.664 --> 02:00:35.794
MARISHA: Should we head straight to Rexxentrum?

02:00:35.794 --> 02:00:37.794
Or do we have any more business in Emon?

02:00:38.914 --> 02:00:41.664
TALIESIN: I don't even technically
know where we are right now.

02:00:42.504 --> 02:00:47.074
LIAM: I think Rexxentrum is best for first stop.

02:00:47.074 --> 02:00:47.964
TRAVIS: Agreed.

02:00:47.964 --> 02:00:48.834
TALIESIN: Agreed.

02:00:48.834 --> 02:00:49.667
MARISHA: Okay.

02:00:50.954 --> 02:00:53.954
SAM: Lady Allura, before we skedaddle,

02:00:53.954 --> 02:00:57.074
may I just have a word in private with you?

02:00:57.074 --> 02:00:58.997
I have a bit of advice needed.

02:01:00.464 --> 02:01:03.304
MATT: "Certainly. This way, please."

02:01:03.304 --> 02:01:04.947
LIAM: Is it all right if I draw on the floor here?

02:01:04.947 --> 02:01:06.424
Is that okay while you go talk,

02:01:06.424 --> 02:01:07.594
or is there a better place for that?

02:01:07.594 --> 02:01:09.394
I don't want-- it's a beautiful room.

02:01:10.734 --> 02:01:13.164
MATT: "The chalk will be consumed by the incantation.

02:01:13.164 --> 02:01:14.644
"You'll be fine."

02:01:14.644 --> 02:01:16.604
LIAM: I will draw on the carpet, thank you.

02:01:16.604 --> 02:01:17.564
MATT: "That's what it's there for."

02:01:17.564 --> 02:01:19.434
TALIESIN: I'm going to leave tea. This was so nice,

02:01:19.434 --> 02:01:21.475
I just feel like it's just appropriate.

02:01:22.659 --> 02:01:23.508
MARISHA: Next to the celebone.

02:01:23.508 --> 02:01:27.664
MATT: Allura walks with you a bit up the staircase

02:01:27.664 --> 02:01:29.524
into the very top of the next floor,

02:01:29.524 --> 02:01:32.264
which you can see separates into two other staircases

02:01:32.264 --> 02:01:33.364
that curve upward.

02:01:33.364 --> 02:01:35.754
There's a door to the left that seems to offshoot

02:01:35.754 --> 02:01:37.804
from the tower, that makes little sense.

02:01:37.804 --> 02:01:39.924
But you've been in a few towers at this point

02:01:39.924 --> 02:01:41.364
and mages just have an odd idea

02:01:41.364 --> 02:01:43.854
of how architecture should function.

02:01:43.854 --> 02:01:46.594
The room is dimly lit, looks almost like the lower chambers

02:01:46.594 --> 02:01:48.617
were specifically lit for your arrival.

02:01:49.604 --> 02:01:52.314
And as you step in the space, she bends down.

02:01:52.314 --> 02:01:53.494
"And what can I do for you?"

02:01:53.494 --> 02:01:55.694
SAM: Oh, yes, it's not much, I just thought

02:01:55.694 --> 02:01:58.804
I could ask you for some magical advice.

02:01:58.804 --> 02:02:02.754
You said yourself that folks like yourself,

02:02:02.754 --> 02:02:06.497
sorcerers, wizards have some trouble up there in Eiselcross.

02:02:07.804 --> 02:02:10.947
And I'm worried about my friend Caleb.

02:02:12.834 --> 02:02:15.597
He would never admit it, but he's extremely weak.

02:02:17.334 --> 02:02:18.974
LIAM: He would.

02:02:18.974 --> 02:02:23.156
SAM: And he's powerful and we're going to need him up there.

02:02:23.156 --> 02:02:25.614
There was a bit of magic that I had heard of

02:02:25.614 --> 02:02:27.634
that I don't think that he can teach me,

02:02:27.634 --> 02:02:30.064
but it's an abjuration spell

02:02:30.064 --> 02:02:32.903
and I thought you might be able to.

02:02:32.903 --> 02:02:34.936
MATT: "Perhaps."
MARISHA: Oh, I love this.

02:02:36.294 --> 02:02:38.334
SAM: It's something that can protect the mind,

02:02:38.334 --> 02:02:41.964
an intellectual fortress, so to speak.

02:02:41.964 --> 02:02:45.304
But I haven't I haven't been able to study it

02:02:45.304 --> 02:02:48.144
since we've been running hither and thither.

02:02:51.274 --> 02:02:54.384
MATT: So you're looking for the spell Intellect Fortress?

02:02:54.384 --> 02:02:55.217
SAM: Uh-huh.

02:02:56.227 --> 02:02:57.177
MARISHA: It's a cool idea.

02:02:59.814 --> 02:03:01.803
LIAM: Welcome to mindhead.

02:03:01.803 --> 02:03:03.470
Welcome to mindhead.

02:03:07.853 --> 02:03:09.070
MATT: Right.

02:03:10.597 --> 02:03:12.689
I was going to say, a 3rd-- yeah, okay.

02:03:15.814 --> 02:03:17.337
She thinks for a moment.

02:03:18.984 --> 02:03:20.527
"I believe I may.

02:03:21.984 --> 02:03:24.604
"Though copying it may take some time.

02:03:24.604 --> 02:03:26.354
"And if you're in a bit of a rush...

02:03:27.504 --> 02:03:29.104
"Let me see what I can do."

02:03:29.104 --> 02:03:31.584
And she steps off into the left hand chamber,

02:03:31.584 --> 02:03:34.344
leaving you there alone at the top of the stairs

02:03:34.344 --> 02:03:37.564
in the dimly lit darkness of this open floor.

02:03:37.564 --> 02:03:39.064
SAM: Any pictures around?

02:03:39.064 --> 02:03:40.617
MATT: Make a perception check with disadvantage.

02:03:40.617 --> 02:03:42.057
SAM: Disadvantage!

02:03:43.633 --> 02:03:44.624
Nine.

02:03:47.544 --> 02:03:50.044
MATT: You don't see much in the way of decor details

02:03:50.044 --> 02:03:51.434
from your current standpoint.

02:03:51.434 --> 02:03:54.454
You do see one heavier tapestry

02:03:54.454 --> 02:03:56.274
that wraps around the far side of the room,

02:03:56.274 --> 02:03:58.374
but you're too far away to make out any details.

02:03:58.374 --> 02:04:01.017
TRAVIS: (whispering) He's asking for a spell.
LAURA: (whispering) Okay.

02:04:01.017 --> 02:04:03.164
SAM: Would probably be rude to steal something,

02:04:03.164 --> 02:04:04.857
so I'll just wait.

02:04:06.659 --> 02:04:07.924
MATT: A short time later, she returns

02:04:07.924 --> 02:04:12.484
and has a small case, a simplified wooden case,

02:04:12.484 --> 02:04:16.147
and goes, "Well, maybe this will do for you?"

02:04:17.244 --> 02:04:18.984
SAM: Oh, yes.

02:04:18.984 --> 02:04:22.504
MATT: "It's a scroll of a spell that seems to pertain

02:04:22.504 --> 02:04:24.104
"to the request that you've made."

02:04:25.344 --> 02:04:26.884
SAM: Excellent.

02:04:26.884 --> 02:04:29.364
Thank you, I care for him very much.

02:04:29.364 --> 02:04:34.364
And want to keep him safe, I saw you do the same

02:04:34.444 --> 02:04:37.354
with Lady Kima downstairs.

02:04:37.354 --> 02:04:40.107
MATT: "Oh, it's more the other way around, really.

02:04:42.654 --> 02:04:45.434
"Nevertheless, I'm sorry your friend is so weak."

02:04:45.434 --> 02:04:47.267
SAM: Well, he's actually

02:04:47.267 --> 02:04:50.294
the strongest among us with everything

02:04:50.294 --> 02:04:51.597
except for his body.

02:04:53.394 --> 02:04:55.944
MATT: "Well, I'm certain he's found ways

02:04:55.944 --> 02:04:58.514
"to exemplify his usefulness

02:04:58.514 --> 02:04:59.767
"in your group."
SAM: Yes.

02:05:01.474 --> 02:05:05.404
Anyway, thank you so much for opening your home to us,

02:05:05.404 --> 02:05:10.204
and showing us your friendship.

02:05:10.204 --> 02:05:11.764
We've traveled a long way together

02:05:11.764 --> 02:05:15.004
and we've made a lot of enemies.

02:05:15.004 --> 02:05:18.064
But it seems that the friends that we've made,

02:05:18.064 --> 02:05:21.397
however few, have been the right ones.

02:05:23.036 --> 02:05:25.894
MATT: "I have a fairly good read on individuals,

02:05:25.894 --> 02:05:30.224
"and you all, complicated as you may be,

02:05:30.224 --> 02:05:35.224
"seem to-- I don't know, be worth investing in.

02:05:37.124 --> 02:05:39.724
"And besides, Yussa owes me a mighty favor."

02:05:39.724 --> 02:05:41.197
SAM: Oh! Okay, well.

02:05:42.234 --> 02:05:43.898
MATT: "But yes.

02:05:43.898 --> 02:05:45.494
"I'll set you on your way, then."

02:05:45.494 --> 02:05:46.487
SAM: Yes, please.

02:05:47.984 --> 02:05:51.034
MATT: And as you all gather once more,

02:05:51.034 --> 02:05:53.527
Caleb finishes his teleportation circle,

02:05:54.524 --> 02:05:57.997
gathering in the center of the alabaster tower,

02:05:59.444 --> 02:06:01.844
heading towards Rexxentrum, is what he said?

02:06:01.844 --> 02:06:03.324
LAURA and TRAVIS: Yeah.
SAM: Is that what he said?

02:06:03.324 --> 02:06:04.274
We'll never know.

02:06:07.724 --> 02:06:08.866
MATT: Did you hear the distant flush?

02:06:08.866 --> 02:06:11.044
(laughter)

02:06:11.044 --> 02:06:11.877
SAM: Distant flush.

02:06:11.877 --> 02:06:13.730
MATT: You wait for Caleb to return.

02:06:13.730 --> 02:06:15.669
TRAVIS: Cascading white palace.

02:06:15.669 --> 02:06:18.299
Ooh, sliding.
SAM: Jagged.

02:06:18.299 --> 02:06:19.132
TALIESIN: Jagged.

02:06:19.132 --> 02:06:22.407
LAURA: In the meantime, Allura, is this tower made of ivory?

02:06:23.744 --> 02:06:25.407
MATT: "No, it's not made of ivory."

02:06:27.424 --> 02:06:28.717
LAURA: Do you have any ivory?

02:06:29.814 --> 02:06:31.294
MATT: "Why, do you need ivory?"

02:06:31.294 --> 02:06:34.747
LAURA: Well, I could use it, but I can also shop.

02:06:35.794 --> 02:06:36.734
TALIESIN: We'll be somewhere.

02:06:36.734 --> 02:06:37.567
LAURA: Yeah.

02:06:37.567 --> 02:06:39.674
SAM: It's a very lovely tower.
LAURA: We should have time to go to a store.

02:06:39.674 --> 02:06:41.657
Is it very old?

02:06:43.679 --> 02:06:46.124
MATT: "Most of it has been renovated."

02:06:46.124 --> 02:06:48.385
SAM: Oh, renovations!
MATT: "Past couple of decades, yes."

02:06:48.385 --> 02:06:50.994
SAM: Nice, nice, it's always good to spruce up the place.

02:06:50.994 --> 02:06:53.887
MATT: "Terrifying run-in a while back with a white dragon."

02:06:55.304 --> 02:06:57.794
SAM: We just had a run in with a white dragon!

02:06:57.794 --> 02:06:59.724
MATT: "I can almost guarantee you, it was not the same."

02:06:59.724 --> 02:07:00.557
SAM: Ah.

02:07:02.474 --> 02:07:04.747
MATT: "Well, good luck.

02:07:05.704 --> 02:07:09.980
"And godspeed, from all the pantheon."

02:07:13.324 --> 02:07:15.249
As you finish your spell,

02:07:15.249 --> 02:07:16.290
as you guys all begin to rush,

02:07:16.290 --> 02:07:18.228
and the last thing you hear is Kima going,

02:07:18.228 --> 02:07:19.715
"Bring it back!"

02:07:19.715 --> 02:07:20.548
ASHLEY: I will!

02:07:23.194 --> 02:07:25.474
MATT: You all rush into the circle.

02:07:25.474 --> 02:07:28.214
Feeling yourselves suddenly thrust to the space

02:07:28.214 --> 02:07:31.844
between space and drawn towards your destination

02:07:31.844 --> 02:07:33.824
of Rexxentrum.

02:07:33.824 --> 02:07:34.875
And that's where we'll go ahead and take a break.

02:07:34.875 --> 02:07:36.393
(groaning)

02:07:36.393 --> 02:07:38.315
TRAVIS: Oh my god.
LAURA: So many things!

02:07:38.315 --> 02:07:39.148
TRAVIS: That was great!

02:07:39.148 --> 02:07:40.907
MARISHA: That was crazy.

02:07:40.907 --> 02:07:43.652
TRAVIS: You got-- can I say the name of it? The sword?

02:07:43.652 --> 02:07:46.085
ASHLEY: Yeah, what do I add?

02:07:46.085 --> 02:07:47.525
MATT: You got the Holy Avenger.

02:07:47.525 --> 02:07:48.436
TALIESIN: What?
(gasping)

02:07:48.436 --> 02:07:49.336
TRAVIS: Platinum greatsword.

02:07:49.336 --> 02:07:50.574
MATT: Kima got that in campaign one.

02:07:50.574 --> 02:07:51.407
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:07:52.592 --> 02:07:54.214
MATT: That was one of the spoils that you guys had,

02:07:54.214 --> 02:07:56.428
but none of you used a two-handed greatsword really,

02:07:56.428 --> 02:07:57.494
so you gave it to her.

02:07:57.494 --> 02:07:59.244
And now she's giving it back a campaign later.

02:07:59.244 --> 02:08:00.910
LAURA and MARISHA: Aww!
TRAVIS: Because it was made of platinum.

02:08:00.910 --> 02:08:02.066
TALIESIN: Paying it forward.

02:08:02.066 --> 02:08:02.994
MATT: And only because you rolled

02:08:02.994 --> 02:08:05.179
a fucking natural 20 on that shit!

02:08:05.179 --> 02:08:06.934
MARISHA: So good.
ASHLEY: Wow!

02:08:06.934 --> 02:08:08.104
TRAVIS: That's amazing.

02:08:08.994 --> 02:08:11.168
MATT: That was a "you can certainly try" moment, I'm like--

02:08:11.168 --> 02:08:12.651
TRAVIS: I know!

02:08:12.651 --> 02:08:13.484
MATT: "All right."

02:08:13.484 --> 02:08:14.515
TALIESIN: And one of the two of us--

02:08:14.515 --> 02:08:16.187
TRAVIS: Thank you, that's amazing.
TALIESIN: -- is going to end up with the staff.

02:08:16.187 --> 02:08:18.224
A piece of the old into the new.

02:08:18.224 --> 02:08:19.304
MATT: Yeah, yeah.

02:08:19.304 --> 02:08:20.309
LIAM: We'll see what it is.

02:08:20.309 --> 02:08:23.829
LIAM: I'm so attached to my--
TRAVIS: Plus that sword's fucking legit!

02:08:23.829 --> 02:08:25.288
ASHLEY: This sword is amazing.
LIAM: -- my attunement.

02:08:25.288 --> 02:08:26.744
TRAVIS: Yes, it is.
TALIESIN: My staff is barely useful.

02:08:26.744 --> 02:08:27.577
TRAVIS: Yes.
LIAM: We'll see.

02:08:27.577 --> 02:08:29.924
LAURA: So the tuning thing that she gave me,

02:08:29.924 --> 02:08:33.254
that'll get me back to our plane, too?

02:08:33.254 --> 02:08:34.464
Or I need a--

02:08:34.464 --> 02:08:36.274
MATT: You would have a device to get you back

02:08:36.274 --> 02:08:38.146
to your common plane.

02:08:38.146 --> 02:08:38.979
LAURA: Okay.

02:08:38.979 --> 02:08:40.408
MATT: That's easier for you to craft and attune to.

02:08:40.408 --> 02:08:41.504
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: It's the places

02:08:41.504 --> 02:08:43.514
you haven't been that's the challenge.

02:08:43.514 --> 02:08:45.456
TRAVIS: Right, we got a break, I forgot.

02:08:45.456 --> 02:08:47.056
MATT: No worries, we'll go to break.

02:08:48.404 --> 02:08:50.232
And yeah, we'll see you back here in a few minutes.

02:08:50.232 --> 02:08:52.014
(laughs) Yay!

02:08:52.815 --> 02:08:55.565
(birds chirping)

02:09:22.740 --> 02:09:25.000
Hey critters, Laura Bailey here.

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.673
Let's see what's up in the Critical Roles shop.

02:09:27.673 --> 02:09:29.500
(upbeat music)

02:09:29.500 --> 02:09:32.053
Oh my gosh, it's so amazing.

02:09:33.675 --> 02:09:35.880
(upbeat music)

02:09:35.880 --> 02:09:38.157
It's so cute, I can't handle it.

02:09:38.157 --> 02:09:41.265
(upbeat music)

02:09:41.265 --> 02:09:43.690
I mean, the traveler always says impulse purchases

02:09:43.690 --> 02:09:45.496
are a good decision.

02:09:45.496 --> 02:09:47.460
(upbeat music)

02:09:47.460 --> 02:09:48.920
Hey, look at these.

02:09:48.920 --> 02:09:50.399
They go on your face.

02:09:50.399 --> 02:09:52.914
(upbeat music)

02:09:52.914 --> 02:09:56.180
The cuteness, it's (gasp) overpowering.

02:09:56.180 --> 02:09:58.412
(upbeat music)

02:09:58.412 --> 02:10:00.488
Darling, I recommend buying two,

02:10:00.488 --> 02:10:04.860
one for you and another for you, let's be honest.

02:10:04.860 --> 02:10:06.940
(upbeat music)

02:10:06.940 --> 02:10:09.145
So click on over to the Critical Role shop.

02:10:09.145 --> 02:10:12.060
Don't worry, there's a few more minutes in the break.

02:10:12.060 --> 02:10:12.893
You still got time.

02:10:12.893 --> 02:10:15.503
(upbeat music)

02:10:15.503 --> 02:10:17.290
Subscribe

02:10:19.020 --> 02:10:20.823
or don't subscribe.

02:10:23.400 --> 02:10:24.803
That's not a question.

02:10:27.130 --> 02:10:30.410
Well, that is nobler in the mind to ponder the pros

02:10:30.410 --> 02:10:33.663
and more pros of Twitch or Twitch Prime,

02:10:35.070 --> 02:10:38.240
or to take hands and gift new subs to critters

02:10:38.240 --> 02:10:40.143
who find they can't afford them.

02:10:42.190 --> 02:10:43.033
To play,

02:10:45.930 --> 02:10:46.763
to sleep.

02:10:48.890 --> 02:10:49.723
No more.

02:10:51.280 --> 02:10:54.920
And by asleep to say the cast and crew of Critical Role

02:10:54.920 --> 02:10:57.610
might find that naps around the hectic schedule

02:10:57.610 --> 02:10:58.956
of a live broadcast

02:10:58.956 --> 02:11:01.790
that we have brought for your consumption,

02:11:01.790 --> 02:11:04.423
both critter and fan alike.

02:11:07.090 --> 02:11:08.090
To play

02:11:09.270 --> 02:11:10.183
or sleep.

02:11:13.510 --> 02:11:14.393
No sleep,

02:11:15.540 --> 02:11:17.433
but just to stream.

02:11:19.090 --> 02:11:20.723
Aye, there's the rub.

02:11:21.870 --> 02:11:26.870
For with your subscription what streams may come.

02:11:30.400 --> 02:11:33.320
Oh man, oh man, oh man, that is a (expletive) tagline.

02:11:33.320 --> 02:11:34.800
We got that?

02:11:34.800 --> 02:11:37.313
Oh, that is Twitch poetry.

02:11:38.778 --> 02:11:40.120
(grunt)

02:11:40.120 --> 02:11:44.090
Oh, anyway, subscribe to Critical Role.

02:11:44.090 --> 02:11:47.700
Use Twitch Prime to subscribe, gift some subscriptions.

02:11:47.700 --> 02:11:49.373
You, you got it.

02:11:52.186 --> 02:11:55.003
Wrong slogan for the skull,

02:11:56.853 --> 02:11:58.561
but that's been good.

02:11:58.561 --> 02:12:01.478
(orchestral music)

02:25:21.410 --> 02:25:22.763
MATT: And welcome back, so.

02:25:22.763 --> 02:25:23.596
LIAM: Curse word.

02:25:23.596 --> 02:25:25.591
LAURA: Yeah, nobody's said anything to you.

02:25:25.591 --> 02:25:26.838
SAM: We did.
LIAM: I did.

02:25:26.838 --> 02:25:29.231
LAURA: Oh, I was so zoned out.

02:25:29.231 --> 02:25:30.605
MATT: Taliesin did it with eye contact. I was impressed.

02:25:30.605 --> 02:25:31.961
TALIESIN: Thank you, I was trying something.

02:25:31.961 --> 02:25:33.760
MATT: It was good.
TALIESIN: Thanks.

02:25:33.760 --> 02:25:35.001
LIAM: You always do.
ASHLEY: With eye contact.

02:25:35.001 --> 02:25:36.763
MATT: So--
TRAVIS: (whispering) Feel me.

02:25:36.763 --> 02:25:37.868
SAM: Oh.
LIAM: (laughs)

02:25:37.868 --> 02:25:39.868
MATT: Returning--
LAURA: (whispering) See me.

02:25:39.868 --> 02:25:40.993
MATT: You all

02:25:40.993 --> 02:25:43.921
(magic flashes) emerge in the basement

02:25:43.921 --> 02:25:47.591
of the Cobalt Soul Archive of Rexxentrum.

02:25:47.591 --> 02:25:50.161
There, sitting across the way,

02:25:50.161 --> 02:25:53.238
one of the various guardians of the library goes,

02:25:53.238 --> 02:25:54.391
"Ah! Who goes there?"

02:25:54.391 --> 02:25:55.651
MARISHA: Ah, shit.

02:25:55.651 --> 02:25:57.451
LAURA: Every time!

02:25:57.451 --> 02:26:00.509
MARISHA: We've honestly been really good at alerting people.

02:26:00.509 --> 02:26:01.381
TRAVIS: The invasion is on!

02:26:01.381 --> 02:26:02.491
MATT: "I know who you are.

02:26:02.491 --> 02:26:03.741
"I know, I know."
MARISHA: Sorry.

02:26:03.741 --> 02:26:06.401
LIAM: Our consistency is key.

02:26:06.401 --> 02:26:10.304
MATT: "Apparently. Go ahead, Expositor."

02:26:11.316 --> 02:26:12.615
MARISHA: (chuckles) Thanks.

02:26:12.615 --> 02:26:16.141
LAURA and MARISHA: (chuckle)

02:26:16.141 --> 02:26:17.761
MARISHA: You think we should check in with Yudala

02:26:17.761 --> 02:26:20.211
while we're here and be like, "Hey, sorry.

02:26:20.211 --> 02:26:21.161
"The thing we definitely--"

02:26:21.161 --> 02:26:22.277
LAURA: Stop looking for it.

02:26:22.277 --> 02:26:23.975
MARISHA: Yeah, it's in the woods.

02:26:23.975 --> 02:26:24.808
TRAVIS: Yes.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:26:24.808 --> 02:26:26.061
MARISHA: Okay, I look for Yudala.

02:26:26.061 --> 02:26:28.301
Or I flag down one of the archivists.

02:26:28.301 --> 02:26:31.813
MATT: Okay, as you guys head up,

02:26:31.813 --> 02:26:36.711
it's, I'd say a slightly more than usual bustling

02:26:36.711 --> 02:26:38.851
day at the library, nothing unusual.

02:26:38.851 --> 02:26:42.584
Just like a number of people walking through.

02:26:44.081 --> 02:26:47.411
You ask one of the nearby archivists,

02:26:47.411 --> 02:26:52.411
and they look, "Oh, yes, Expositor Beauregard.

02:26:52.411 --> 02:26:55.284
"This way, they're in a bit of a meeting."

02:26:56.405 --> 02:26:57.238
MARISHA: A meeting?

02:26:57.238 --> 02:27:02.011
MATT: Leads you over to one of the side gathering chambers,

02:27:02.011 --> 02:27:03.001
and the door's open,

02:27:03.001 --> 02:27:05.451
and there is a conversation happening

02:27:05.451 --> 02:27:09.981
with a few of the members of the archive,

02:27:09.981 --> 02:27:11.504
as well as Yudala Fon.

02:27:13.031 --> 02:27:14.978
And as soon as you walk over,

02:27:14.978 --> 02:27:16.251
you can see Yudala Fon stops talking,

02:27:16.251 --> 02:27:17.594
glances over and sees you.

02:27:18.901 --> 02:27:23.264
"Oh, Beauregard, give us just a moment, please."

02:27:24.310 --> 02:27:26.826
MARISHA: Oh, okay.

02:27:26.826 --> 02:27:28.016
MATT: Yudala looks at the other folks,

02:27:28.016 --> 02:27:29.611
and gives a nod wordlessly,

02:27:29.611 --> 02:27:31.641
and they finish up, take their materials,

02:27:31.641 --> 02:27:32.501
and they all begin to leave.

02:27:32.501 --> 02:27:34.541
MARISHA: Can I read any lips?

02:27:34.541 --> 02:27:35.574
With my Observant?

02:27:35.574 --> 02:27:37.241
Did I catch any of the last of what they were saying?

02:27:37.241 --> 02:27:38.228
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:27:38.228 --> 02:27:39.442
MARISHA: Okay.

02:27:42.209 --> 02:27:45.061
Okay, okay, it's fine.

02:27:45.061 --> 02:27:45.894
16.

02:27:46.821 --> 02:27:50.221
MATT: 16, you pick up not of Yudala Fon,

02:27:50.221 --> 02:27:51.521
who had turned away from you

02:27:51.521 --> 02:27:53.303
to continue the conversation.

02:27:53.303 --> 02:27:55.368
Somebody else across the way quickly retorts with,

02:27:56.910 --> 02:27:58.309
"Much to think about."

02:27:59.178 --> 02:28:02.171
And they begin to leave as Yudala Fon

02:28:02.171 --> 02:28:04.811
then looks over and gives you a gesture

02:28:04.811 --> 02:28:06.721
to enter the chamber.

02:28:06.721 --> 02:28:10.521
MARISHA: Okay, are these guys joining me?

02:28:10.521 --> 02:28:11.588
LAURA: Are we allowed to?

02:28:11.588 --> 02:28:13.540
MATT: It's up to you.

02:28:13.540 --> 02:28:16.121
MARISHA: It's up to me?
MATT: Well, do you ask, or like?

02:28:16.121 --> 02:28:18.474
MARISHA: I guess I was asking them, and

02:28:18.474 --> 02:28:19.921
do you guys want to come in?

02:28:19.921 --> 02:28:22.696
SAM: To a secret meeting? Yeah, of course.

02:28:22.696 --> 02:28:24.801
MARISHA: Well, I think the meeting's over.

02:28:24.801 --> 02:28:27.551
LAURA: As we're walking in, I'm going to just grab Fjord,

02:28:27.551 --> 02:28:29.331
and go: Isn't there a chance

02:28:29.331 --> 02:28:31.468
we're wanted criminals in this city?

02:28:31.468 --> 02:28:32.708
TRAVIS: Yeah, absolutely.

02:28:32.708 --> 02:28:33.541
LAURA: Okay.

02:28:35.301 --> 02:28:37.244
MATT: As the rest of you begin to approach,

02:28:38.201 --> 02:28:40.381
some of the guardians on the outside

02:28:40.381 --> 02:28:44.511
of this meeting chamber actually interface to stop you,

02:28:44.511 --> 02:28:48.854
as Beauregard begins to walk in and Yudala Fon goes,

02:28:49.811 --> 02:28:53.480
"My apologies, just a moment in private, please."

02:28:53.480 --> 02:28:57.481
TRAVIS: Oh, yes. We will keep watch out here.

02:28:57.481 --> 02:29:00.541
SAM: Only Expositors can go in?

02:29:00.541 --> 02:29:02.605
MATT: "For the time, just a few moments."

02:29:02.605 --> 02:29:04.201
SAM: Okay.
TALIESIN: All right.

02:29:04.201 --> 02:29:05.034
MARISHA: Sorry.

02:29:06.561 --> 02:29:11.051
MATT: You enter and it's just you and the High Curator.

02:29:11.051 --> 02:29:13.491
The door closes behind, and the inside of this chamber,

02:29:13.491 --> 02:29:16.171
and you've not been in this room
in the Rexxentrum archive before.

02:29:16.171 --> 02:29:18.561
There's similar chambers in Zadash,

02:29:18.561 --> 02:29:19.501
where you had originally trained,

02:29:19.501 --> 02:29:23.051
but on the inside here, it is an octagonal room

02:29:23.051 --> 02:29:24.691
that in the center-- it's very war-room-esque.

02:29:24.691 --> 02:29:27.910
You can see there's a central table in the chamber

02:29:27.910 --> 02:29:29.421
that has an oval-type shape.

02:29:29.421 --> 02:29:31.041
There are no chairs, it's very much a standing

02:29:31.041 --> 02:29:33.281
and leaning-type composition.

02:29:33.281 --> 02:29:36.461
Everyone's meant to be at attention around the table.

02:29:36.461 --> 02:29:40.501
The center of it has this soft blue material

02:29:40.501 --> 02:29:41.534
stretched over it,

02:29:41.534 --> 02:29:45.164
and at the very edge has a faint,

02:29:46.106 --> 02:29:49.141
white-gold trim that clamps on the material

02:29:49.141 --> 02:29:51.831
to make it smooth and straight.

02:29:51.831 --> 02:29:53.761
SAM: I'm going to wait two minutes

02:29:53.761 --> 02:29:58.181
and then cast Message to her during the meeting.

02:29:58.181 --> 02:29:59.014
MATT: You've got it.

02:30:00.381 --> 02:30:01.497
MARISHA: To me?
SAM: Yeah.

02:30:01.497 --> 02:30:02.713
MARISHA: Okay.

02:30:03.641 --> 02:30:06.101
MATT: As you make your way around,

02:30:06.101 --> 02:30:09.361
and Yudala Fon is well-known within the organization.

02:30:09.361 --> 02:30:12.571
They're definitely one of the most respected figures

02:30:13.421 --> 02:30:15.831
in the Cobalt Soul in Exandria, let alone,

02:30:15.831 --> 02:30:18.581
the one that essentially holds the fort

02:30:18.581 --> 02:30:21.657
against the Crown here in the capital.

02:30:23.701 --> 02:30:26.521
So being just the two of you in the chamber

02:30:26.521 --> 02:30:29.081
is a little intimidating, to say the least.

02:30:29.081 --> 02:30:31.382
Now, as they turn to you,

02:30:31.382 --> 02:30:32.481
and you instinctually meet them

02:30:32.481 --> 02:30:36.661
on the opposite side of the chamber, they smile warmly.

02:30:36.661 --> 02:30:39.481
Their bright orange-red hair

02:30:40.321 --> 02:30:45.321
and soft position seems to offset

02:30:45.481 --> 02:30:48.571
the unexpected tension

02:30:48.571 --> 02:30:52.061
of your team being excluded from this.

02:30:52.061 --> 02:30:53.611
MARISHA: What's wrong?

02:30:53.611 --> 02:30:54.671
I immediately say.

02:30:54.671 --> 02:30:57.888
MATT: "Right, my apologies.

02:30:58.911 --> 02:31:03.911
"Things have been curious in the capital as of late,

02:31:04.051 --> 02:31:06.761
"and there's just a lot of conversation abound

02:31:06.761 --> 02:31:07.984
"in trusted circles.

02:31:10.621 --> 02:31:15.604
"Specifically, there has been conversation

02:31:18.241 --> 02:31:21.124
"around the King, of

02:31:25.281 --> 02:31:29.871
"investigations between the Cerberus Assembly

02:31:31.701 --> 02:31:32.984
"and the Kryn Dynasty.

02:31:35.441 --> 02:31:39.454
"This was begun by Expositor Dairon,

02:31:41.751 --> 02:31:43.511
"and some of what you have been able

02:31:43.511 --> 02:31:48.511
"to extend in your journeys has helped us

02:31:49.031 --> 02:31:52.354
"piece this together, but this was kept internal.

02:31:53.701 --> 02:31:55.331
"Either there was a leak

02:31:55.331 --> 02:31:57.781
"or they've had their own investigations

02:31:57.781 --> 02:32:01.001
"within the Augen Trust, which is possible.

02:32:01.001 --> 02:32:05.438
"This is not a bad thing, as,

02:32:05.438 --> 02:32:08.279
"to be perfectly honest,

02:32:08.279 --> 02:32:12.363
"in-fighting amongst those who are wrongly

02:32:13.991 --> 02:32:16.921
"in control of this empire,

02:32:16.921 --> 02:32:19.451
"only makes their position of power weaker."

02:32:19.451 --> 02:32:21.231
SAM: Are you in danger?

02:32:21.231 --> 02:32:24.401
If you are not, curse.

02:32:24.401 --> 02:32:28.571
Anything else will be interpreted as a call for help.

02:32:28.571 --> 02:32:30.384
You may reply to this message.

02:32:32.751 --> 02:32:33.992
MARISHA: Well, fuck.

02:32:34.851 --> 02:32:36.301
SAM: She's okay.

02:32:36.301 --> 02:32:41.301
(laughter)

02:32:41.371 --> 02:32:43.721
MATT: "If you'd like a more formal discussion,

02:32:43.721 --> 02:32:46.491
"Dairon is within the archive.

02:32:46.491 --> 02:32:48.754
"If you'd like to speak with them on your way out."

02:32:52.051 --> 02:32:55.864
MARISHA: I'm trying to get a read
on this situation, High Curator.

02:32:57.331 --> 02:32:59.016
Are we in trouble?

02:32:59.016 --> 02:33:00.974
MATT: "No, no.

02:33:02.711 --> 02:33:04.591
"I guess I'm frustrated that

02:33:06.131 --> 02:33:08.151
"we were the ones heading this investigation

02:33:08.151 --> 02:33:11.001
"and assembling proof

02:33:12.001 --> 02:33:14.701
"and attempting to really suss out

02:33:14.701 --> 02:33:18.964
"the scope of this treachery,

02:33:21.091 --> 02:33:23.251
"and possibly use it to undermine

02:33:25.821 --> 02:33:27.924
"key figures within the Empire.

02:33:31.641 --> 02:33:33.304
"However, this is a bit too soon,

02:33:34.161 --> 02:33:35.861
"and if these investigations are coming directly

02:33:35.861 --> 02:33:37.461
"from the crown, then that means,

02:33:38.491 --> 02:33:41.241
"while advantageous in some ways we had hoped,

02:33:41.241 --> 02:33:45.041
"we lose control over how this can be weaponized

02:33:45.041 --> 02:33:46.968
"against such figures,"

02:33:46.968 --> 02:33:49.051
and you see Yudala then glance around

02:33:49.051 --> 02:33:51.611
with a lot of this conversation just being very careful

02:33:51.611 --> 02:33:54.231
that nobody is in the chamber or listening.

02:33:54.231 --> 02:33:56.711
As some of this conversation would be considered,

02:33:56.711 --> 02:34:00.471
in its own right, easy to interpret

02:34:00.471 --> 02:34:01.554
as traitorous.
MARISHA: And the Augen Trust

02:34:01.554 --> 02:34:03.270
is the Dwendalian...?

02:34:03.270 --> 02:34:04.811
MATT: It's the Dwendalian spy network.

02:34:04.811 --> 02:34:07.299
MARISHA: Spy network, right, right, right, okay.

02:34:09.439 --> 02:34:12.389
MATT: "(sighing) But what I really
wanted to speak to you about.

02:34:13.251 --> 02:34:17.661
"First off, I hope any of our information that you requested

02:34:17.661 --> 02:34:20.954
"is helpful to you and if not,

02:34:21.821 --> 02:34:26.194
"you are traveling in some very esoteric places.

02:34:29.721 --> 02:34:34.118
"I also wanted to let you know that Zeenoth

02:34:35.926 --> 02:34:38.581
"is currently being held at the Zadash archive

02:34:38.581 --> 02:34:42.584
"under arrest by the library."

02:34:45.147 --> 02:34:45.980
MARISHA: Zeenoth?

02:34:47.311 --> 02:34:49.569
MATT: "On top of

02:34:49.569 --> 02:34:53.011
"their looking into this mess

02:34:53.011 --> 02:34:56.201
"with the Dynasty, Dairon had also been looking

02:34:56.201 --> 02:35:01.101
"into claims that you had apparently made of being kidnapped

02:35:01.101 --> 02:35:05.894
"by the Cobalt Soul and forced into your tutelage."

02:35:12.437 --> 02:35:13.270
MARISHA: Um.

02:35:16.751 --> 02:35:20.644
Wow. Sorry, I wasn't expecting any of this.

02:35:23.721 --> 02:35:25.184
Y-yes.

02:35:27.187 --> 02:35:30.030
MATT: "That is not how we operate."

02:35:30.030 --> 02:35:33.212
MARISHA: I honestly didn't know that.

02:35:34.801 --> 02:35:38.761
MATT: "And into this investigation, Dairon discovered

02:35:38.761 --> 02:35:42.421
"that Zeenoth was the one responsible

02:35:42.421 --> 02:35:44.421
"for accepting the money from your father

02:35:45.281 --> 02:35:47.721
"and oversaw the acquisition of you

02:35:47.721 --> 02:35:51.924
"and your forced tutelage,

02:35:53.841 --> 02:35:55.301
"as well as many other briberies

02:35:55.301 --> 02:35:57.851
"and illegal activity under the name of the library.

02:35:58.791 --> 02:36:03.791
"So, first,

02:36:03.866 --> 02:36:05.601
"let me say

02:36:05.601 --> 02:36:10.321
"thank you for being honest about your experience

02:36:10.321 --> 02:36:13.062
"with the Expositor

02:36:13.062 --> 02:36:18.062
"in aiding us in finding this link.

"And exposing a very serious seed of corruption

"within our very

02:36:34.361 --> 02:36:36.561
"Let me please extend my sincerest apologies."

02:36:40.460 --> 02:36:41.635
MARISHA: Um.

02:36:44.593 --> 02:36:46.010
(unsure chuckle)

02:36:46.010 --> 02:36:47.010
Thank you.

02:36:49.781 --> 02:36:52.451
Sorry, I'm a little taken aback by all of this.

02:36:59.201 --> 02:37:01.844
The Soul really helped me find a way

02:37:04.961 --> 02:37:06.731
maybe much more indirectly

02:37:08.911 --> 02:37:10.954
than what is the norm.

02:37:23.431 --> 02:37:24.264
Yeah.

02:37:27.261 --> 02:37:30.721
It's odd, looking at one

02:37:30.721 --> 02:37:33.857
of the most traumatic moments of my life and

02:37:36.891 --> 02:37:38.611
on another side,

02:37:38.611 --> 02:37:40.881
feeling a sense of thanks

02:37:40.881 --> 02:37:42.874
and gratitude that it happened.

02:37:45.771 --> 02:37:47.571
Because it did send me on this path.

02:37:53.451 --> 02:37:57.831
I didn't know that flaky corn husk of a man

02:37:57.831 --> 02:38:01.364
actually had any of this in him, to be totally honest.

02:38:04.481 --> 02:38:08.271
I gave him a lot of shit, a really hard time,

02:38:08.271 --> 02:38:10.391
if that makes you all feel any better.

02:38:10.391 --> 02:38:11.911
He did have to deal with me,

02:38:11.911 --> 02:38:14.061
so he reaped a little bit of what he sowed.

02:38:16.628 --> 02:38:17.853
MATT: "That is good to know.

02:38:19.381 --> 02:38:23.172
"And I'm glad that you found a place within the Cobalt Soul.

02:38:24.921 --> 02:38:26.431
"But we would like to think

02:38:26.431 --> 02:38:28.911
"that you would have found your way here regardless,

02:38:28.911 --> 02:38:31.061
"and it should always have been your choice.

02:38:33.771 --> 02:38:35.804
"And I know we cannot make that up to you,

02:38:37.701 --> 02:38:41.411
"but I want to extend my,

02:38:41.411 --> 02:38:44.664
"our deepest apologies."

02:38:50.213 --> 02:38:51.046
MARISHA: Thank you.

02:38:53.091 --> 02:38:53.924
Thank you for

02:38:57.741 --> 02:38:59.614
taking these matters so seriously.

02:39:02.570 --> 02:39:03.520
I didn't expect it.

02:39:05.761 --> 02:39:08.019
I guess you get used to

02:39:10.458 --> 02:39:12.911
cruelty being handed down as the norm.

02:39:16.259 --> 02:39:18.921
MATT: "We are not absolved of responsibility

02:39:18.921 --> 02:39:20.391
"in accidental cruelty.

02:39:20.391 --> 02:39:23.144
"We are people and people are complicated and messy.

02:39:25.081 --> 02:39:28.141
"But if there's one thing that we cannot abide by,

02:39:28.141 --> 02:39:30.851
"it's corruption within our very halls.

02:39:30.851 --> 02:39:34.384
"That stands against everything that we stand for.

02:39:36.251 --> 02:39:38.221
"We are not a body of government.

02:39:38.221 --> 02:39:40.491
"We are not a religious group.

02:39:40.491 --> 02:39:43.661
"We are a people that want to protect

02:39:43.661 --> 02:39:47.554
"those who cannot protect themselves from abuses of power.

02:39:50.144 --> 02:39:52.344
"And you've been abused by somebody in power.

02:39:53.761 --> 02:39:55.961
"We will see that they are properly punished.

02:39:57.361 --> 02:40:00.101
"You're not required to, but if you wish to engage

02:40:00.101 --> 02:40:03.986
"in the trial in about two months, you are welcome."

02:40:06.291 --> 02:40:08.207
MARISHA: Oh,

02:40:10.032 --> 02:40:13.190
I guess we'll see if I'm still alive in two months.

02:40:16.571 --> 02:40:21.451
I'm following this trail that the Nonagon is leaving

02:40:21.451 --> 02:40:22.534
to the very end.

02:40:25.791 --> 02:40:29.201
The Soul has taught me the utmost value

02:40:29.201 --> 02:40:33.111
of seeking out and rooting out the corruption.

02:40:33.111 --> 02:40:35.277
And this is of the most obscene corruption.

02:40:35.277 --> 02:40:38.602
And this is of the most obscene corruption.

02:40:38.602 --> 02:40:43.031
It is a corruption to life and to all of Exandria.

02:40:43.031 --> 02:40:44.191
I know it's not political

02:40:44.191 --> 02:40:46.441
and it's not what the Soul normally deals in,

02:40:48.771 --> 02:40:50.584
but it is a corruption nonetheless.

02:40:52.013 --> 02:40:53.771
MATT: "Well, we trust your instincts.

02:40:56.321 --> 02:40:58.254
"But do try and stay alive.

02:41:01.901 --> 02:41:04.444
"And if it gets too dangerous,

02:41:07.356 --> 02:41:08.464
"return to us."

02:41:12.209 --> 02:41:13.134
MARISHA: Okay.

02:41:15.111 --> 02:41:17.964
MATT: "Anyway, I think I've left your friends long enough,

02:41:19.251 --> 02:41:23.011
"and I have to attend a meeting

02:41:23.011 --> 02:41:24.191
"with the Council of the Crown,

02:41:24.191 --> 02:41:27.461
"so I guess wish me luck as well.

02:41:35.021 --> 02:41:37.251
"Hold onto that gut, Beauregard.

02:41:37.251 --> 02:41:38.914
"There's a bright future ahead of you."

02:41:42.291 --> 02:41:44.551
MARISHA: You'd be smart to focus your attention

02:41:44.551 --> 02:41:46.844
to Ludinus and Ikithon.

02:41:48.961 --> 02:41:50.611
MATT: "It never leaves them.

02:41:52.303 --> 02:41:54.714
"And they've been acting quite nervous recently.

02:41:58.291 --> 02:41:59.524
"I must leave."

02:42:00.551 --> 02:42:04.101
MARISHA: You said Dairon was outside?

02:42:04.101 --> 02:42:05.661
MATT: "She should be,"

02:42:05.661 --> 02:42:08.871
and with that, Yudala Fon heads towards the exit

02:42:08.871 --> 02:42:11.584
with a much more business-face.

02:42:12.461 --> 02:42:14.754
MARISHA: Thank you, High Curator.

02:42:15.901 --> 02:42:17.881
MATT: "You as well, Expositor."

02:42:17.881 --> 02:42:20.206
And they continue out past all of you.

02:42:20.206 --> 02:42:21.631
LAURA: Yudala!

02:42:21.631 --> 02:42:22.686
MATT: Give a nod and a smile.

02:42:22.686 --> 02:42:25.121
LAURA: So good to talk to you in person!

02:42:25.121 --> 02:42:25.954
MATT: Keeps walking by.

02:42:25.954 --> 02:42:29.294
LAURA: Sure do enjoy hearing your voice!

02:42:30.491 --> 02:42:31.538
TRAVIS: What's the matter with you?

02:42:31.538 --> 02:42:33.970
LAURA: What, I talk to them all the time!

02:42:33.970 --> 02:42:36.429
We're like old friends!

02:42:36.429 --> 02:42:38.261
MATT: They definitely acknowledged you as they passed,

02:42:38.261 --> 02:42:40.770
but they definitely seem like they'd be in a bit of a rush.

02:42:40.770 --> 02:42:42.371
LAURA: (laughs)

02:42:42.371 --> 02:42:43.731
It's been fun!

02:42:43.731 --> 02:42:45.851
SAM: Beau?
LIAM: You all right?

02:42:45.851 --> 02:42:49.564
SAM: So how did they take the news
about the threshold crest?

02:42:50.441 --> 02:42:51.497
MARISHA: Fuck!

02:42:51.497 --> 02:42:56.497
(laughter)

02:42:57.051 --> 02:42:58.911
I'll tell Dairon. We'll just tell Dairon.

02:42:58.911 --> 02:42:59.744
SAM: Okay.

02:42:59.744 --> 02:43:01.481
MARISHA: They can run it up the chain.

02:43:01.481 --> 02:43:02.381
SAM: Are you okay?

02:43:02.381 --> 02:43:04.191
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

02:43:04.191 --> 02:43:05.411
LAURA: Are we in trouble?

02:43:05.411 --> 02:43:07.231
MARISHA: No, I thought that.

02:43:07.231 --> 02:43:09.766
SAM: Do they know about, you know?

02:43:09.766 --> 02:43:12.601
MARISHA: (uncertain noises)

02:43:12.601 --> 02:43:13.921
I mean, I think they have some idea,

02:43:13.921 --> 02:43:16.444
but they're also like into that type of shit.

02:43:19.156 --> 02:43:22.471
TRAVIS: (laughs)

02:43:22.471 --> 02:43:24.294
MARISHA: They apologized.

02:43:25.451 --> 02:43:26.294
LIAM: For?
ASHLEY: For?

02:43:28.681 --> 02:43:32.744
MARISHA: Do you all remember Archivist Zeenoth?

02:43:32.744 --> 02:43:34.160
MARISHA: Do you all remember Archivist Zeenoth?

02:43:34.160 --> 02:43:35.193
LIAM: Of course.

02:43:35.193 --> 02:43:38.901
MARISHA: Yeah, that scraggly, withered--

02:43:38.901 --> 02:43:40.137
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:43:40.137 --> 02:43:42.251
TRAVIS: No.

02:43:42.251 --> 02:43:44.366
MARISHA: A long time ago, but anyway.

02:43:44.366 --> 02:43:45.199
TRAVIS: Bad for me.

02:43:45.199 --> 02:43:49.974
MARISHA: He is arrested?

02:43:51.641 --> 02:43:55.811
Being held by the Cobalt Soul in Zadash,

02:43:55.811 --> 02:43:59.601
because he was the one

02:43:59.601 --> 02:44:02.994
who made the deal with my father.

02:44:04.341 --> 02:44:06.111
SAM: The deal with your father?

02:44:06.111 --> 02:44:07.711
LAURA: To get taken away?

02:44:07.711 --> 02:44:09.121
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

02:44:09.121 --> 02:44:10.671
LAURA: He wasn't allowed to do that?

02:44:12.791 --> 02:44:14.694
MARISHA: I asked the same thing.

02:44:19.151 --> 02:44:20.271
There was always this part of me

02:44:20.271 --> 02:44:22.731
that never fully trusted the reserve,

02:44:22.731 --> 02:44:27.731
because this operation

02:44:27.821 --> 02:44:32.481
that seeks out and roots out corruption

02:44:32.481 --> 02:44:35.921
apparently accepted this large donation from my father

02:44:35.921 --> 02:44:38.598
in exchange for me.

02:44:38.598 --> 02:44:42.461
And I didn't even know what type of weird handshake

02:44:42.461 --> 02:44:44.521
of a deal my father made.

02:44:44.521 --> 02:44:46.944
And so I just assumed that it was part of the system,

02:44:46.944 --> 02:44:50.402
but no,

02:44:50.402 --> 02:44:53.571
I guess Zeenoth pocketed that money,

02:44:53.571 --> 02:44:58.513
and is now being held under arrest.

02:44:58.513 --> 02:45:01.096
and is now being held under arrest.

02:45:01.096 --> 02:45:03.513
LAURA: That must feel pretty good!

02:45:06.218 --> 02:45:08.019
LIAM: Are you all right?

02:45:14.261 --> 02:45:15.861
MARISHA: Do you know that feeling where

02:45:19.171 --> 02:45:20.671
you didn't realize something was wrong

02:45:20.671 --> 02:45:22.811
until someone told you and you just lived with it

02:45:22.811 --> 02:45:23.944
this whole time and--?

02:45:31.321 --> 02:45:35.231
I'm relieved, but also reckoning with it

02:45:35.231 --> 02:45:36.154
at the same time.

02:45:39.581 --> 02:45:40.414
I don't know.

02:45:42.461 --> 02:45:44.726
Yeah, I'm good, I'm okay.

02:45:44.726 --> 02:45:47.092
LIAM: Okay.
SAM: Because you were

02:45:47.092 --> 02:45:51.001
brought into the fold under corrupt means,

02:45:51.001 --> 02:45:53.541
does that mean they're throwing you out or anything?

02:45:53.541 --> 02:45:54.851
Or?

02:45:54.851 --> 02:45:56.861
MARISHA: No, not at all.

02:45:56.861 --> 02:45:59.892
TRAVIS: Do you feel any differently about the Cobalt Soul?

02:46:06.441 --> 02:46:08.491
MARISHA: A little bit more comfortable, I guess.

02:46:14.241 --> 02:46:15.074
Assured.

02:46:21.271 --> 02:46:23.031
SAM: Yeah, I mean, in a way they're choosing you

02:46:23.031 --> 02:46:25.531
over one of their old guard, right?

02:46:25.531 --> 02:46:26.924
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

02:46:27.821 --> 02:46:28.654
SAM: That's cool.

02:46:30.191 --> 02:46:31.941
MARISHA: I think that's what's all coming.

02:46:33.001 --> 02:46:34.736
LIAM: Seems like a lot to process.

02:46:34.736 --> 02:46:36.264
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:46:37.296 --> 02:46:38.394
TRAVIS: Are we killing your dad next?

02:46:38.394 --> 02:46:40.826
Is that what's happening?

02:46:40.826 --> 02:46:43.671
MARISHA: I don't know, no, I'll call you when I need that.

02:46:43.671 --> 02:46:45.381
TRAVIS: Okay.
SAM: Did he commit a crime?

02:46:45.381 --> 02:46:47.798
Is he going to be under arrest, too?

02:46:47.798 --> 02:46:48.724
TRAVIS: Oh.
ASHLEY: Yeah,

02:46:48.724 --> 02:46:50.031
that was going to be my question.

02:46:50.031 --> 02:46:52.061
TRAVIS: That is a two-way door, I would imagine.

02:46:52.061 --> 02:46:54.061
ASHLEY: Wait, break this down for me,

02:46:54.061 --> 02:46:58.201
because I feel like I know half of this,

02:46:58.201 --> 02:47:00.741
because I was in and out mentally.

02:47:00.741 --> 02:47:02.041
MARISHA: Yeah, you've been, yeah.

02:47:05.221 --> 02:47:08.561
ASHLEY: Zeenoth paid your dad or your dad paid?

02:47:08.561 --> 02:47:10.271
MARISHA: My dad paid Zeenoth.

02:47:10.271 --> 02:47:12.301
SAM: To let you into the Soul?

02:47:12.301 --> 02:47:13.764
MARISHA: To take me away from him.

02:47:15.631 --> 02:47:17.924
He didn't want to deal with me.

02:47:19.581 --> 02:47:20.661
LIAM: Sent her to boarding school.

02:47:20.661 --> 02:47:22.271
MARISHA: Sent me to boarding school, exactly.

02:47:22.271 --> 02:47:26.001
TRAVIS: A boarding school that
normally doesn't accept payment.

02:47:26.001 --> 02:47:28.924
SAM: It was a school admission scandal?

02:47:29.791 --> 02:47:30.624
Is that what just happened?

02:47:30.624 --> 02:47:31.457
LIAM: Correct, that is.

02:47:31.457 --> 02:47:33.121
MARISHA: From a privileged elite.

02:47:33.121 --> 02:47:34.520
TRAVIS: You're on the rowing team?

02:47:34.520 --> 02:47:37.816
(laughter)

02:47:37.816 --> 02:47:40.171
MARISHA: He told me, "Tell them you're a great rower."

02:47:40.171 --> 02:47:42.193
And I was like, "I've never fucking rowed in my life."

02:47:42.193 --> 02:47:44.341
TRAVIS: And you took a picture while they drew you, like.

02:47:44.341 --> 02:47:47.131
MARISHA: Yeah, there's no fucking rivers in Kamordah.

02:47:47.131 --> 02:47:48.901
(laughter)

02:47:48.901 --> 02:47:51.462
SAM: Is that why your staff is an oar?

02:47:51.462 --> 02:47:53.681
(laughter)

02:47:53.681 --> 02:47:55.004
MATT: A big backstory reveal!

02:47:55.004 --> 02:47:57.241
(laughter)

02:47:57.241 --> 02:47:58.574
SAM: Holy shit.

02:47:59.731 --> 02:48:00.564
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:48:02.781 --> 02:48:06.414
You know, I was a lot to deal with.

02:48:08.061 --> 02:48:11.191
A bit of an embarrassment to my father, specifically.

02:48:13.199 --> 02:48:14.331
He didn't know what to do with me.

02:48:14.331 --> 02:48:16.813
I got in trouble with the local law enough and

02:48:19.746 --> 02:48:22.696
I never questioned it.

02:48:26.461 --> 02:48:30.301
I guess I just got so used to thinking that that's...

02:48:32.751 --> 02:48:34.658
Money motivates people, right?

02:48:36.374 --> 02:48:37.593
ASHLEY: Apparently.

02:48:37.593 --> 02:48:39.010
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm. Some people.

02:48:41.431 --> 02:48:43.014
LAURA: Good to know not everybody.

02:48:45.781 --> 02:48:50.001
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

02:48:50.001 --> 02:48:51.831
LAURA: Do you need to be comforted?

02:48:51.831 --> 02:48:55.651
Do you need to be held in some big, strong arms?

02:48:55.651 --> 02:48:57.201
Will that make you feel better?

02:48:58.435 --> 02:48:59.461
TALIESIN: Group hug.
MARISHA: Group hug?

02:48:59.461 --> 02:49:02.107
Sure, group hug.

02:49:02.107 --> 02:49:04.785
SAM: Were you just going to
cast Enlarge on her or something?

02:49:04.785 --> 02:49:06.641
(laughter)

02:49:06.641 --> 02:49:08.411
MARISHA: I just hold myself.

02:49:08.411 --> 02:49:09.784
TRAVIS: Just the arms, poof!

02:49:12.033 --> 02:49:14.029
TALIESIN: The self-hug is too 2020.

02:49:17.526 --> 02:49:20.452
MARISHA: Sorry, before all of that, she also said

02:49:20.452 --> 02:49:23.846
that they were having a meeting

02:49:23.846 --> 02:49:26.884
because they're investigating the king.

02:49:26.884 --> 02:49:29.650
TRAVIS: Haha, are we alone in this hallway?

02:49:29.650 --> 02:49:30.909
MATT: No, you were in the middle of the--

02:49:30.909 --> 02:49:33.375
MARISHA: Oh, sorry, I thought we were still.

02:49:33.375 --> 02:49:34.758
Um, well-

02:49:34.758 --> 02:49:36.392
TRAVIS: Can't you tell these guards to, I don't know,

02:49:36.392 --> 02:49:37.911
fuck off?

02:49:37.911 --> 02:49:38.952
MARISHA: (stammering)

02:49:38.952 --> 02:49:40.831
LAURA: Can we go in the room that you guys just came out of?

02:49:40.831 --> 02:49:41.797
SAM: Oh yeah, the war room.

02:49:41.797 --> 02:49:43.951
MARISHA: Let me get a room.

02:49:43.951 --> 02:49:46.355
MATT: Okay, the war room is sealed up,

02:49:46.355 --> 02:49:48.030
but there is a private chamber, that you can--

02:49:48.030 --> 02:49:49.283
TRAVIS: Can we take the situation room?

02:49:49.283 --> 02:49:50.590
We'll just be 10 minutes.

02:49:50.590 --> 02:49:53.230
TALIESIN: There must be a conference room here somewhere.

02:49:53.230 --> 02:49:54.238
TRAVIS: That's not a problem, right?

02:49:54.238 --> 02:49:55.734
MARISHA: We pick a side conference room.

02:49:55.734 --> 02:49:56.567
Conference room B.

02:49:56.567 --> 02:49:58.066
MATT: Exactly.
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:49:58.066 --> 02:50:00.324
MATT: Most of them are spoken for.
ASHLEY: You guys weren't using it, right?

02:50:00.324 --> 02:50:01.903
TRAVIS: Uh, no.

02:50:01.903 --> 02:50:03.240
TALIESIN: You guys have a day spa?

02:50:03.240 --> 02:50:04.191
Jesus.

02:50:04.191 --> 02:50:05.193
MARISHA: Okay, close the door.

02:50:05.193 --> 02:50:06.026
MATT: Yeah.

02:50:07.872 --> 02:50:09.492
MARISHA: Yeah, they're investigating King Dwendal

02:50:09.492 --> 02:50:11.537
because of this whole--
TRAVIS: Mm!

02:50:11.537 --> 02:50:14.801
(sword blasts) See Invisibility.

02:50:14.801 --> 02:50:16.551
MATT: Perception check.

02:50:19.289 --> 02:50:21.993
TRAVIS: 21, natural 18.

02:50:21.993 --> 02:50:25.540
SAM: Matt, I will also See Invisibility,

02:50:25.540 --> 02:50:26.698
with my new--

02:50:26.698 --> 02:50:29.309
TRAVIS: Excuse me, say <i>what</i>?

02:50:29.309 --> 02:50:30.809
SAM: It doesn't work the same as yours.

02:50:30.809 --> 02:50:32.113
TALIESIN: Also, we haven't had time,

02:50:32.113 --> 02:50:33.000
there's been no short rest.

02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:35.463
So you haven't had time to attune to it.

02:50:35.463 --> 02:50:36.296
SAM: No, no.

02:50:36.296 --> 02:50:37.307
It's a feature.

02:50:37.307 --> 02:50:38.217
TALIESIN: Oh.

02:50:38.217 --> 02:50:41.430
SAM: I can see creatures who are invisible

02:50:41.430 --> 02:50:42.888
within 10 feet of me.
LAURA: Don't we have to sleep

02:50:42.888 --> 02:50:44.104
before we--
TRAVIS: What do you have?

02:50:44.104 --> 02:50:45.716
LIAM: We're pushing it.
SAM: It's a new thing.

02:50:45.716 --> 02:50:47.116
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:50:47.116 --> 02:50:49.452
SAM: I haven't even read about it yet.

02:50:49.452 --> 02:50:50.376
LIAM: Yeah.
LAURA: Abilities.

02:50:50.376 --> 02:50:51.209
MATT: Okay.

02:50:52.470 --> 02:50:54.148
SAM: Blindsense.

02:50:54.148 --> 02:50:55.225
I'm going to just walk around the room,

02:50:55.225 --> 02:50:57.903
see if there's any invisible people in here.

02:50:57.903 --> 02:50:59.333
MATT: Sure.
LIAM: Marco!

02:50:59.333 --> 02:51:01.775
(laughter)

02:51:01.775 --> 02:51:02.608
MATT: Feels pretty safe.

02:51:02.608 --> 02:51:03.441
SAM: Okay.

02:51:03.441 --> 02:51:04.274
TRAVIS: No orbs?

02:51:04.274 --> 02:51:05.474
MATT: You don't see anything, no.

02:51:05.474 --> 02:51:06.307
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:51:06.307 --> 02:51:07.398
LAURA: So King Dwendal.

02:51:07.398 --> 02:51:10.591
MARISHA: King Dwendal, and this whole rigamarole

02:51:10.591 --> 02:51:12.460
that went down between the Cerberus Assembly

02:51:12.460 --> 02:51:13.850
and the Kryn Dynasty,

02:51:13.850 --> 02:51:17.183
and however that handoff happened which--

02:51:18.887 --> 02:51:21.047
So I guess apparently the Augen Trust

02:51:21.047 --> 02:51:23.128
did their own investigation and--

02:51:23.128 --> 02:51:25.666
help me, because you were talking really fast.

02:51:25.666 --> 02:51:28.175
They're upset with the Augen Trust?

02:51:28.175 --> 02:51:29.736
Or they don't trust the Augen Trust because

02:51:29.736 --> 02:51:31.486
they're attached to--

02:51:31.486 --> 02:51:34.786
LIAM: The king is independently sniffing the Assembly's butt

02:51:34.786 --> 02:51:37.197
before the Cobalt could sniff their butt.

02:51:37.197 --> 02:51:38.030
MATT: Correct.

02:51:38.030 --> 02:51:39.336
They're worried their investigation

02:51:39.336 --> 02:51:42.125
is being taken out from under them, essentially.

02:51:42.125 --> 02:51:44.696
And may not have all the information.

02:51:44.696 --> 02:51:46.373
MARISHA: Right, or be as--

02:51:46.373 --> 02:51:48.275
MATT and MARISHA: As thorough and--

02:51:48.275 --> 02:51:50.403
MATT: Yeah, it's hard to try and prove a point

02:51:50.403 --> 02:51:52.394
that has already been--

02:51:52.394 --> 02:51:53.235
LIAM: Decreed?

02:51:53.235 --> 02:51:55.418
MATT: Or yeah, decreed, finished and discarded.

02:51:55.418 --> 02:51:56.686
And trying to reprove it,

02:51:56.686 --> 02:51:58.374
than it is to come out with all the evidence up front

02:51:58.374 --> 02:51:59.620
in a very thorough investigation.

02:51:59.620 --> 02:52:00.829
MARISHA: Double jeopardy stuff,

02:52:00.829 --> 02:52:01.953
yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, okay, okay.

02:52:01.953 --> 02:52:03.366
MATT: So they're a little worried about that,

02:52:03.366 --> 02:52:05.550
but they're looking into it.

02:52:05.550 --> 02:52:06.426
They're just letting you know that,

02:52:06.426 --> 02:52:07.332
because you were in the middle of it,

02:52:07.332 --> 02:52:08.515
that is transpiring.

02:52:08.515 --> 02:52:11.849
LAURA: The Assembly is being sniffed out on all sides then?

02:52:11.849 --> 02:52:13.870
MARISHA: That's what it sounds like, right?

02:52:13.870 --> 02:52:14.703
That's what it sounds like?
MATT: Yeah.

02:52:14.703 --> 02:52:15.536
MARISHA: Yeah, that's what it sounds.

02:52:15.536 --> 02:52:16.453
MATT: To what extent, you're not sure,

02:52:16.453 --> 02:52:18.213
but at least it's happening.

02:52:19.121 --> 02:52:20.537
MARISHA: Okay.
LAURA: All right.

02:52:20.537 --> 02:52:21.370
LIAM: Okay.

02:52:21.370 --> 02:52:24.509
Well, that makes knocking on that door

02:52:24.509 --> 02:52:25.598
all the more interesting.

02:52:25.598 --> 02:52:27.601
MARISHA: Yes.
LAURA: Could we sleep before we knock on that door?

02:52:27.601 --> 02:52:28.810
SAM: What a day!

02:52:28.810 --> 02:52:31.036
LAURA: It has been <i>a day</i>..

02:52:31.036 --> 02:52:32.539
I feel like we're all going to get sick

02:52:32.539 --> 02:52:36.109
from all these temperature jumps, you know?

02:52:36.109 --> 02:52:38.097
SAM: Oh shit.
LIAM: Yes?

02:52:38.097 --> 02:52:39.085
SAM: We were right--

02:52:39.085 --> 02:52:40.378
We were three blocks from--

02:52:40.378 --> 02:52:41.343
LAURA: We didn't even see our family.

02:52:41.343 --> 02:52:43.144
SAM: I know. Are we shitty?

02:52:43.144 --> 02:52:44.251
We're shitty people.

02:52:44.251 --> 02:52:45.560
TRAVIS: There's some stuff going on.

02:52:45.560 --> 02:52:47.264
SAM: I know, but we were right there.
LAURA: At the end of the day,

02:52:47.264 --> 02:52:49.357
if we save them from the world being destroyed

02:52:49.357 --> 02:52:51.862
then we're really good people.

02:52:51.862 --> 02:52:54.304
TRAVIS: You can send a message tonight.

02:52:54.304 --> 02:52:56.856
SAM: I wanted to give him a snowball.

02:52:56.856 --> 02:52:58.536
LAURA: Oh, it's probably melted by now.

02:52:58.536 --> 02:52:59.527
SAM: Yeah.
LAURA: Yeah.

02:52:59.527 --> 02:53:01.559
ASHLEY: But you do have the clay doggies.

02:53:01.559 --> 02:53:02.439
SAM: I do.

02:53:02.439 --> 02:53:04.117
TALIESIN: You can just give him a cup of water,

02:53:04.117 --> 02:53:05.592
and then--
SAM: Freeze it?

02:53:05.592 --> 02:53:07.180
ASHLEY: Say it was

02:53:07.180 --> 02:53:08.972
water from Eiselcross.
LAURA: That's true.

02:53:12.506 --> 02:53:14.445
TRAVIS: Who are we supposed to connect with, then,

02:53:14.445 --> 02:53:16.933
if not Yudala?

02:53:16.933 --> 02:53:18.216
MARISHA: Let me check in with Dairon

02:53:18.216 --> 02:53:19.305
and I can at least

02:53:19.305 --> 02:53:22.523
relay this threshold crest information to them.

02:53:22.523 --> 02:53:25.946
And then they should be able to handle it from there.

02:53:25.946 --> 02:53:28.196
LAURA: Oh, one thing.

02:53:29.424 --> 02:53:32.449
Are we going to be in trouble?

02:53:34.923 --> 02:53:37.165
You know, is anybody-- do you think?

02:53:37.165 --> 02:53:39.853
Do they know about us?

02:53:39.853 --> 02:53:41.875
SAM: You mean for--?

02:53:41.875 --> 02:53:43.119
LAURA: I mean, not that we did it.

02:53:43.119 --> 02:53:45.335
SAM: No, we didn't.
LAURA: I mean, we can always say,

02:53:45.335 --> 02:53:47.304
"Oh--" if they find out that she got killed,

02:53:47.304 --> 02:53:49.368
we could say exactly what happened.

02:53:49.368 --> 02:53:51.730
That somebody killed her and we chased after them,

02:53:51.730 --> 02:53:54.356
and we were trying to get the killers

02:53:54.356 --> 02:53:56.067
so that we could bring them.

02:53:56.067 --> 02:53:57.436
MARISHA: And you know what?

02:53:57.436 --> 02:53:58.794
At this point--

02:53:58.794 --> 02:54:00.756
LIAM: It's a bit more of a long-term problem

02:54:00.756 --> 02:54:03.304
when we're only here for a short time.

02:54:03.304 --> 02:54:04.685
LAURA: Right.
LIAM: We're about to go to--

02:54:04.685 --> 02:54:06.242
LAURA: So long as we don't get captured,

02:54:06.242 --> 02:54:08.642
and then we can't get away.

02:54:08.642 --> 02:54:11.587
And then he releases...

02:54:11.587 --> 02:54:12.754
LIAM: That's true.

02:54:13.621 --> 02:54:16.941
MARISHA: At this point, Lucien has her body.

02:54:16.941 --> 02:54:18.108
LAURA: Yeah.
MARISHA: So.

02:54:19.752 --> 02:54:21.353
TRAVIS: You know.

02:54:21.353 --> 02:54:24.260
SAM: He does things with bodies sometimes.

02:54:24.260 --> 02:54:26.948
Like, he can put somebody else's soul into it

02:54:26.948 --> 02:54:28.199
or raise it and--

02:54:28.199 --> 02:54:30.449
LAURA: He wouldn't want to raise her body.

02:54:30.449 --> 02:54:33.264
TALIESIN: We don't really know if he can do that.

02:54:33.264 --> 02:54:35.072
That's a lot.
SAM: He can do a lot of stuff.

02:54:35.072 --> 02:54:37.000
LIAM: We have been fairly expedient, though.

02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:39.531
We could, if we agreed to,

02:54:39.531 --> 02:54:42.233
we could let you contact Dairon.

02:54:42.233 --> 02:54:43.499
MARISHA: Well, she's-- they're here.

02:54:43.499 --> 02:54:44.478
SAM: Oh, fuck.

02:54:44.478 --> 02:54:45.311
LIAM: Sure.

02:54:46.374 --> 02:54:47.324
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:54:47.324 --> 02:54:48.599
LIAM: If you want to do that tonight,

02:54:48.599 --> 02:54:49.598
or do you want to do it in the morning?

02:54:49.598 --> 02:54:51.871
We could try to get all our business done here.

02:54:51.871 --> 02:54:55.341
MARISHA: No, I mean they're there in the other room.

02:54:55.341 --> 02:54:56.990
LAURA: Well, then go find!
LIAM: Thumbs up.

02:54:56.990 --> 02:54:58.240
MARISHA: Yeah, okay.

02:54:58.240 --> 02:54:59.073
TRAVIS: Lead the way.

02:54:59.073 --> 02:55:00.773
TALIESIN: Maybe sleep tonight--
LAURA: And then we'll sleep.

02:55:00.773 --> 02:55:01.832
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:55:01.832 --> 02:55:03.109
TALIESIN: I'm very tired.

02:55:03.109 --> 02:55:04.696
MARISHA: Do you want to sleep here in the Reserve, or?

02:55:04.696 --> 02:55:06.161
LAURA: Oh yeah, we could do that.

02:55:06.161 --> 02:55:08.071
LIAM: If that's permitted, <i>ja</i>.
TALIESIN: Even better.

02:55:08.071 --> 02:55:08.904
MARISHA: Sure.

02:55:10.122 --> 02:55:11.621
Yeah.

02:55:11.621 --> 02:55:12.640
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: Okay.

02:55:12.640 --> 02:55:14.047
I go find Dairon.

02:55:14.047 --> 02:55:15.901
MATT: It takes a little bit to find out where Dairon is.

02:55:15.901 --> 02:55:17.744
Dairon, at this point

02:55:17.744 --> 02:55:21.632
is preparing to go onto another leg of a journey.

02:55:21.632 --> 02:55:23.009
She's packing up things

02:55:23.009 --> 02:55:25.449
and Dairon packs pretty light.

02:55:25.449 --> 02:55:27.708
She's used to hopping around pretty quick,

02:55:27.708 --> 02:55:29.960
but you catch and she glances over

02:55:29.960 --> 02:55:31.816
and sees you approach.

02:55:31.816 --> 02:55:33.357
"Beauregard!

02:55:33.357 --> 02:55:34.565
"Very good to see you."
MARISHA: I just walk up to her

02:55:34.565 --> 02:55:35.880
and I just give her a huge hug

02:55:35.880 --> 02:55:38.070
before they can finish what they're saying.

02:55:39.337 --> 02:55:42.170
MATT: "It is good to see you as well."

02:55:46.072 --> 02:55:47.230
MARISHA: Thank you.

02:55:50.829 --> 02:55:53.863
You didn't tell me you were doing all that.

02:55:53.863 --> 02:55:56.213
MATT: "When you you told me what had happened,

02:55:59.095 --> 02:56:00.928
"it deeply bothered me.

02:56:05.068 --> 02:56:06.735
"I've been hurt before

02:56:07.613 --> 02:56:09.196
"by people in power.

02:56:16.104 --> 02:56:17.237
"So.

02:56:18.983 --> 02:56:23.225
"I did what I always wished somebody did for me."

02:56:25.370 --> 02:56:28.240
MARISHA: Just give them another hug.

02:56:28.240 --> 02:56:29.740
Thank you for not--

02:56:34.841 --> 02:56:37.424
Thank you for breaking the chains, I guess.

02:56:39.562 --> 02:56:42.429
MATT: "Many more chains to be broken."

02:56:47.574 --> 02:56:48.915
MARISHA: Where are you going?

02:56:50.849 --> 02:56:53.261
MATT: "Well, I'm going to put my ears out

02:56:53.261 --> 02:56:55.594
"and listen for more of this--

02:56:58.481 --> 02:56:59.890
"It looks like you've been informed."

02:56:59.890 --> 02:57:00.723
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

02:57:02.549 --> 02:57:03.879
MATT: "This certainly mucks up a lot

02:57:03.879 --> 02:57:06.416
"of what I've been working for, for some time.

02:57:06.416 --> 02:57:08.507
"So I'm going to try

02:57:08.507 --> 02:57:11.364
"and slow the misinformation,

02:57:11.364 --> 02:57:15.581
"maintain control of this narrative."

02:57:17.815 --> 02:57:20.555
MARISHA: Let me know if you need anything from me.

02:57:20.555 --> 02:57:22.065
MATT: "I will."

02:57:22.065 --> 02:57:24.182
MARISHA: You still have that seal I gave you?

02:57:24.182 --> 02:57:25.628
MATT: "I do."

02:57:25.628 --> 02:57:26.968
MARISHA: Okay.

02:57:26.968 --> 02:57:28.619
MATT: She pulls it out

02:57:28.619 --> 02:57:30.469
and looks at it for a second and goes,

02:57:32.855 --> 02:57:33.688
"Actually, Beauregard,

02:57:33.688 --> 02:57:35.905
"I would also like to apologize."

02:57:37.288 --> 02:57:38.438
Eyes still on the seal,

02:57:38.438 --> 02:57:39.929
turning it over in her hand.

02:57:43.613 --> 02:57:48.030
"I have been emotionally driven in the past, vengeful,

02:57:50.133 --> 02:57:51.466
"a clouded mind.

02:57:52.883 --> 02:57:55.416
"And that has led me to have...

02:57:57.316 --> 02:57:58.216
"prejudices

02:58:01.580 --> 02:58:03.830
"that were unfounded."

02:58:05.623 --> 02:58:07.956
Still staring at the symbol of the Bright Queen.

02:58:11.392 --> 02:58:14.749
"Spending time within the Dynasty,

02:58:14.749 --> 02:58:18.649
"behind enemy lines, if you will, during this conflict.

02:58:21.852 --> 02:58:23.159
"You just begin to realize

02:58:23.159 --> 02:58:25.855
"how little difference there is in people trying to survive

02:58:25.855 --> 02:58:27.105
"and be happy."

02:58:30.809 --> 02:58:33.476
MARISHA: Similar conclusions on my end.

02:58:35.352 --> 02:58:38.598
MATT: "I still have my mistrust of authority,

02:58:38.598 --> 02:58:39.719
"and this Luxon business

02:58:39.719 --> 02:58:41.924
"certainly smells like a religious con.

02:58:43.866 --> 02:58:46.649
"I regret buying into Empire propaganda.

02:58:49.039 --> 02:58:53.898
"And I guess, if my apology isn't enough,

02:58:55.153 --> 02:58:56.235
"let this be a reminder

02:58:56.235 --> 02:58:59.902
"that even those above you have their faults.

02:59:02.886 --> 02:59:04.969
"We all have much to learn."

02:59:06.627 --> 02:59:09.519
MARISHA: You told me on our first lesson

02:59:09.519 --> 02:59:11.214
to trust no one,

02:59:11.214 --> 02:59:13.514
even you and the Soul.

02:59:15.154 --> 02:59:19.237
And early on, I took that advice and ran with it.

02:59:21.672 --> 02:59:23.164
It's good advice.

02:59:26.481 --> 02:59:27.923
MATT: "I don't know.

02:59:29.623 --> 02:59:32.710
"Eventually you have to trust someone."

02:59:32.710 --> 02:59:33.626
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:59:34.736 --> 02:59:36.310
I trust you.

02:59:36.310 --> 02:59:37.268
MATT: "Hmm.

02:59:38.750 --> 02:59:39.691
"Well..."

02:59:41.291 --> 02:59:43.107
MARISHA: Do you trust you?

02:59:44.454 --> 02:59:46.555
MATT: "We'll find out."

02:59:46.555 --> 02:59:47.896
MARISHA: Don't be too hard on yourself.

02:59:47.896 --> 02:59:51.907
Yeah, you definitely said some really dumb shit

02:59:51.907 --> 02:59:53.027
back in the day.

02:59:53.027 --> 02:59:54.093
I was a little--
MATT: "I know."

02:59:54.093 --> 02:59:56.550
MARISHA: Me, I was like, oof! This feels--
MATT: "I know, I know."

02:59:56.550 --> 02:59:58.007
MARISHA: -- kind of extreme.
MATT: "I know."

02:59:58.007 --> 02:59:58.840
MARISHA: But

03:00:03.889 --> 03:00:05.972
you're smarter than that.

03:00:07.073 --> 03:00:08.527
You're above the Empire.

03:00:08.527 --> 03:00:11.777
You're an Expositor.

03:00:13.264 --> 03:00:16.360
MATT: "I'm still but one person.

03:00:16.360 --> 03:00:18.018
"I'm still learning.

03:00:21.074 --> 03:00:22.249
"Anyway,

03:00:25.923 --> 03:00:28.256
"you're making us all proud. I hope you know that."

03:00:31.039 --> 03:00:32.992
MARISHA: Just hoping I don't let you down.

03:00:32.992 --> 03:00:33.900
MATT: "Hmm."

03:00:36.235 --> 03:00:38.975
MARISHA: Hey, if you're hiking in the woods...

03:00:38.975 --> 03:00:41.600
MATT: (laughs)

03:00:42.921 --> 03:00:43.871
TRAVIS: Oh boy.

03:00:43.871 --> 03:00:45.004
MARISHA: We kind of,

03:00:46.470 --> 03:00:49.328
sort of attempted to teleport

03:00:49.328 --> 03:00:53.248
a giant ancient magical artifact here,

03:00:53.248 --> 03:00:57.320
and didn't really work.

03:00:57.320 --> 03:01:00.842
It's in the woods somewhere.

03:01:00.842 --> 03:01:03.583
Lots of fir trees

03:01:03.583 --> 03:01:06.141
and light dusting of snow.

03:01:06.141 --> 03:01:07.432
And--
MATT: "So you're telling me

03:01:07.432 --> 03:01:11.412
"that you have transported a powerful artifact

03:01:11.412 --> 03:01:13.801
"to a place in the woods?"

03:01:13.801 --> 03:01:15.167
MARISHA: (squeaky) Uh-huh.

03:01:15.167 --> 03:01:18.964
MATT: "And you would like me to find it?"

03:01:18.964 --> 03:01:22.898
MARISHA: No, not you personally. It's just, you know...

03:01:22.898 --> 03:01:24.665
MATT: "Is this dangerous?"

03:01:25.817 --> 03:01:27.227
TRAVIS: (chuckles)

03:01:27.227 --> 03:01:28.394
MATT: "How dangerous?"

03:01:29.300 --> 03:01:30.443
MARISHA: It's hard to say.

03:01:30.443 --> 03:01:32.526
It kind of feels like it needs to be in a right place

03:01:32.526 --> 03:01:34.613
at a right time, with people who know how to use it.

03:01:34.613 --> 03:01:35.446
Other than that,

03:01:35.446 --> 03:01:39.613
it might just be a really big, super magical rock.

03:01:40.916 --> 03:01:42.200
Like this big.

03:01:45.634 --> 03:01:47.508
Like a cheese wheel.

03:01:47.508 --> 03:01:50.874
But if it was worth like 40,000 platinum

03:01:50.874 --> 03:01:53.733
But if it was worth like 40,000 platinum

03:01:53.733 --> 03:01:55.483
and is irreplaceable.

03:01:57.367 --> 03:02:01.259
MATT: "I'll send out a few teams to--"

03:02:01.259 --> 03:02:02.879
MARISHA: Okay.
MATT: "-- look for this--"

03:02:02.879 --> 03:02:04.993
MARISHA: Like a giant butterscotch candy.

03:02:04.993 --> 03:02:06.411
MATT: "Right, I gathered as much.

03:02:06.411 --> 03:02:08.419
"The cheese wheel was very evocative."

03:02:08.419 --> 03:02:09.721
MARISHA: Okay, okay, yeah.

03:02:09.721 --> 03:02:11.429
MATT: "All right.

03:02:11.429 --> 03:02:12.762
"I'm going to go."

03:02:13.662 --> 03:02:15.044
MARISHA: Okay.

03:02:15.044 --> 03:02:18.000
(chuckling)

03:02:18.000 --> 03:02:21.197
I give 'em like the, you know.

03:02:21.197 --> 03:02:23.715
MATT: The Beastmaster hand--
MARISHA: The Beastmaster handshake, yeah.

03:02:23.715 --> 03:02:24.846
ASHLEY: Yes!

03:02:26.571 --> 03:02:28.881
MATT: "Until the next meeting."

03:02:28.881 --> 03:02:30.461
MARISHA: Same to you.

03:02:30.461 --> 03:02:32.317
MATT: Puts her stuff over her shoulder and

03:02:32.317 --> 03:02:34.876
heads out of the archive.

03:02:35.896 --> 03:02:37.299
MARISHA: I join the others.

03:02:37.299 --> 03:02:38.466
TRAVIS: Any spheres?

03:02:39.571 --> 03:02:41.988
MATT: Still looking around? None.

03:02:43.578 --> 03:02:44.561
MARISHA: All right.

03:02:44.561 --> 03:02:47.850
Information about the threshold crest has been delivered--

03:02:47.850 --> 03:02:49.221
SAM: Great.
LIAM: Okay.

03:02:49.221 --> 03:02:50.950
MARISHA: What ends up happening to it?

03:02:50.950 --> 03:02:52.238
SAM: Not our problem.
MARISHA: Not our problem.

03:02:52.238 --> 03:02:54.002
SAM: You told one other person.

03:02:54.002 --> 03:02:54.835
We're done!
MARISHA: I did.

03:02:54.835 --> 03:02:56.941
I fulfilled my end of the bargain.

03:02:56.941 --> 03:02:59.274
SAM: Yeah.
TRAVIS: How'd they take it?

03:03:00.805 --> 03:03:01.763
MARISHA: Fine.

03:03:01.763 --> 03:03:04.679
Fine. I think I'm really distracted with other stuff.

03:03:06.339 --> 03:03:09.095
TRAVIS: You relayed that this is a really super magical,

03:03:09.095 --> 03:03:12.698
big, heavy rock in the middle of the woods, right?

03:03:12.698 --> 03:03:14.895
MARISHA: I said exactly those words.
TRAVIS: Oh!

03:03:14.895 --> 03:03:17.395
LAURA: But apparently are super, super, super rare, right?

03:03:17.395 --> 03:03:19.060
MARISHA: A hundred percent.
LAURA: If you, like, break them up,

03:03:19.060 --> 03:03:19.993
so that like--
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:03:19.993 --> 03:03:21.212
LAURA: -- they can get spread around the world.

03:03:21.212 --> 03:03:23.261
And this is like a big honky one?

03:03:23.261 --> 03:03:25.150
MARISHA: Yeah, I said it was the size of a cheese wheel,

03:03:25.150 --> 03:03:27.232
but like super magical.
LAURA: A cheese wheel?

03:03:27.232 --> 03:03:28.517
Is it like a--
SAM: Not how I would describe it.

03:03:28.517 --> 03:03:29.506
LAURA: I thought it was like--

03:03:29.506 --> 03:03:31.763
SAM: I would be more like a butterscotch.

03:03:31.763 --> 03:03:33.431
MARISHA: Well, I said butterscotch candy,

03:03:33.431 --> 03:03:34.714
and then she said a cheese wheel

03:03:34.714 --> 03:03:36.547
would be evocative.
TRAVIS: Like a jaw-breaker?

03:03:36.547 --> 03:03:37.480
MARISHA: Well, I mean it was like--

03:03:37.480 --> 03:03:39.765
it depends-- you know those Werther's

03:03:39.765 --> 03:03:41.737
that are a little wonky on one side?

03:03:41.737 --> 03:03:43.861
SAM: Who doesn't know fantasy Werther's?

03:03:43.861 --> 03:03:46.211
TRAVIS: Werther's [inaudible].

03:03:46.211 --> 03:03:48.813
LIAM: The Werther's family in northern Rexxentrum? Yeah.

03:03:48.813 --> 03:03:49.927
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:03:49.927 --> 03:03:52.284
Great confectionery.
TRAVIS: Damn Werther's.

03:03:52.284 --> 03:03:53.480
LIAM: Candy kingpins.

03:03:53.480 --> 03:03:54.377
MARISHA: Yeah. (laughs)

03:03:54.377 --> 03:03:56.563
ASHLEY: But I only like the original ones, you know?

03:03:56.563 --> 03:03:57.749
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah, sure--

03:03:57.749 --> 03:03:59.210
TRAVIS: The Tossmans.
MARISHA: The old recipe?

03:03:59.210 --> 03:04:00.576
ASHLEY: Yeah, the old recipe.
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:04:00.576 --> 03:04:02.025
MARISHA: They tried to renovate it--

03:04:02.025 --> 03:04:03.077
ASHLEY: It got weird.
MARISHA: It got weird.

03:04:03.077 --> 03:04:03.910
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:04:03.910 --> 03:04:06.160
LIAM: My grandparents loved them.

03:04:06.160 --> 03:04:07.967
MARISHA: Most grandparents do.

03:04:07.967 --> 03:04:10.800
(laughter)

03:04:10.800 --> 03:04:12.347
TRAVIS: To be fair, I fucking love them.

03:04:12.347 --> 03:04:13.564
ASHLEY: I love them.
MARISHA: They're delicious!

03:04:13.564 --> 03:04:15.096
TRAVIS: I love them!

03:04:15.096 --> 03:04:17.354
Every time I'm like, yeah!
MARISHA: I kind of want some now.

03:04:17.354 --> 03:04:18.587
MATT: So what's the plan?

03:04:18.587 --> 03:04:20.202
LAURA: Oh, oh, right.

03:04:20.202 --> 03:04:21.965
SAM: Are we going to spend the night in the library?

03:04:21.965 --> 03:04:23.035
TRAVIS: Yes, yes--
LAURA: We need sleep.

03:04:23.035 --> 03:04:24.135
We really need to sleep.

03:04:24.135 --> 03:04:27.922
LIAM: Procure chambers and talk out
our game plan for the morrow.

03:04:27.922 --> 03:04:28.838
MATT: Yep, it's easy enough for you

03:04:28.838 --> 03:04:30.438
to procure a chamber for the evening,

03:04:30.438 --> 03:04:33.789
or chambers for multiple individuals, if you'd like to.

03:04:33.789 --> 03:04:35.438
SAM: Or we can sleep in the mansion.

03:04:35.438 --> 03:04:37.238
MATT: If you have the spell.
LIAM: No, we can't.

03:04:37.238 --> 03:04:39.607
LAURA: We're all still fucking exhausted.

03:04:39.607 --> 03:04:41.490
LIAM: <i>Ja,</i> this is the longest day ever!

03:04:41.490 --> 03:04:43.545
SAM: Oh wow, we're still exhausted!

03:04:43.545 --> 03:04:44.985
MATT: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Oh, it's still--

03:04:44.985 --> 03:04:46.248
LIAM: Yes, in one day, one long day.

03:04:46.248 --> 03:04:47.418
TALIESIN: One long day.

03:04:47.418 --> 03:04:50.441
LIAM: Where we jumped to the AM. It's like we were in France

03:04:50.441 --> 03:04:52.316
and then we went to Tokyo, for--
LAURA: We're so jet lagged.

03:04:52.316 --> 03:04:53.633
LIAM: -- one hour.
MATT: Yeah, you guys are going to--

03:04:53.633 --> 03:04:54.666
MARISHA: Go back to France.

03:04:54.666 --> 03:04:55.499
MATT: It's going to be a little weird.

03:04:55.499 --> 03:04:57.164
TALIESIN: I think we're like in DC now,

03:04:57.164 --> 03:04:59.123
it's such a mess.
LAURA: We're going to sleep for 20 hours.

03:04:59.123 --> 03:05:00.901
(laughter)

03:05:00.901 --> 03:05:03.370
MARISHA: Okay, I procure us a couple of rooms,

03:05:03.370 --> 03:05:05.647
but let's all gather in one and talk it out.

03:05:05.647 --> 03:05:07.705
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.
MATT: All right. Easy enough to do.

03:05:07.705 --> 03:05:10.023
So after a short time,

03:05:10.023 --> 03:05:12.327
the evening begins to click into Rexxentrum,

03:05:12.327 --> 03:05:15.339
the city lights begin to fill the streets.

03:05:15.339 --> 03:05:19.961
A light rain begins the hit the outside street.

03:05:19.961 --> 03:05:22.310
You can hear the faint patter before the closed doors

03:05:22.310 --> 03:05:26.691
to the library are shuttered and locked for the night.

03:05:26.691 --> 03:05:29.766
And you make your way to your chambers safely.

03:05:29.766 --> 03:05:31.212
Private.

03:05:31.212 --> 03:05:32.045
You're good.

03:05:32.045 --> 03:05:33.816
TRAVIS: A light rain.

03:05:33.816 --> 03:05:35.110
I don't trust it.

03:05:35.110 --> 03:05:38.190
(laughter)

03:05:38.190 --> 03:05:40.202
LIAM: Fjord, are you--
TRAVIS: I check my belongings.

03:05:40.202 --> 03:05:42.247
(laughter)

03:05:42.247 --> 03:05:43.813
LAURA: Oh, they're all gone. Yep.

03:05:43.813 --> 03:05:46.240
MATT: Your sword is missing.

03:05:46.240 --> 03:05:48.845
TRAVIS: Hmm?
LIAM: Are you good to check?

03:05:48.845 --> 03:05:49.678
SAM: Again?

03:05:49.678 --> 03:05:51.272
TRAVIS: How long did it take you to get us a room?

03:05:51.272 --> 03:05:52.531
MATT: Oh, it's been a long time since--

03:05:52.531 --> 03:05:53.898
TRAVIS: No.
LIAM: No.

03:05:54.896 --> 03:05:57.382
SAM: If they fucking use Fluffernutter against me,

03:05:57.382 --> 03:05:59.222
I will be so pissed off.

03:05:59.222 --> 03:06:01.409
TRAVIS: Yes, that's the one thing we're really--

03:06:01.409 --> 03:06:04.230
MATT: If only one of them used a crossbow.

03:06:04.230 --> 03:06:05.397
SAM: Oh no.

03:06:06.714 --> 03:06:08.169
MATT: You thought you hated Otis before.

03:06:08.169 --> 03:06:09.252
SAM: Oh no.

03:06:09.252 --> 03:06:11.839
I probably only have, like, 10 bolts on me.

03:06:11.839 --> 03:06:13.186
TRAVIS: Motivation rises.
SAM: If not less.

03:06:13.186 --> 03:06:14.719
MATT: You might want to buy some while you're in town.

03:06:14.719 --> 03:06:17.750
TALIESIN: A couple of things we got to get, anyway, so.

03:06:17.750 --> 03:06:21.975
I'm going to need a couple tuning forks.

03:06:21.975 --> 03:06:23.599
SAM: Tuning forks?
TALIESIN: Tuning forks.

03:06:23.599 --> 03:06:26.047
LAURA: So that we can attune to this plane of existence.

03:06:26.047 --> 03:06:27.009
SAM: Oh, okay.

03:06:27.009 --> 03:06:28.679
TALIESIN: I got to remember how to do that.

03:06:28.679 --> 03:06:30.646
I've never tried it before.
LAURA: I've never tried it,

03:06:30.646 --> 03:06:31.864
but I bet we could figure it out.

03:06:31.864 --> 03:06:32.697
TALIESIN: We'll figure it out.
LAURA: Yeah.

03:06:32.697 --> 03:06:34.444
I'll ask Artie about it, he'll know.

03:06:34.444 --> 03:06:36.235
TRAVIS: So for tomorrow.

03:06:36.235 --> 03:06:39.925
LIAM: Yeah. I have a minor errand to run,

03:06:39.925 --> 03:06:41.929
just some components to purchase.

03:06:41.929 --> 03:06:44.337
LAURA: Oh, oh, oh! Can you get some ivory?

03:06:45.190 --> 03:06:46.321
LIAM: If I can afford it, yeah.

03:06:46.321 --> 03:06:48.369
TRAVIS: And what is your thing with ivory, lately?

03:06:48.369 --> 03:06:51.009
LAURA: If I can have some ivory, then I can do this spell

03:06:51.009 --> 03:06:53.231
where we can find out some secrets.

03:06:53.231 --> 03:06:54.140
SAM: Ooh!

03:06:54.140 --> 03:06:55.041
LIAM: Okay, well, let's go--

03:06:55.041 --> 03:06:56.296
TALIESIN: I may have some components, too,

03:06:56.296 --> 03:06:57.237
I'll hit you up later.

03:06:57.237 --> 03:06:58.070
LIAM: Okay.

03:07:00.597 --> 03:07:03.825
Jester hit on a very sharp idea.

03:07:03.825 --> 03:07:08.825
I know that we had contemplated talking to my old companions

03:07:09.248 --> 03:07:12.282
just to see if we could
suss anything out and maybe we can, but

03:07:14.032 --> 03:07:16.795
I don't know. It seems like
they're in the weeds themselves right now.

03:07:16.795 --> 03:07:19.579
I might be able to lean there

03:07:19.579 --> 03:07:22.889
and get some more of those medallions,

03:07:22.889 --> 03:07:25.729
and hopefully put us all off the map.

03:07:25.729 --> 03:07:27.215
MARISHA: That's a great idea.

03:07:27.215 --> 03:07:28.824
LIAM: You hear that?

03:07:30.398 --> 03:07:31.498
TRAVIS: Seconded.

03:07:31.498 --> 03:07:35.412
Would you need company on this meeting or?

03:07:35.412 --> 03:07:36.245
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

03:07:36.245 --> 03:07:37.410
TRAVIS: Okay, okay, yep.

03:07:37.410 --> 03:07:38.364
MARISHA: With this situation,

03:07:38.364 --> 03:07:43.197
with the Assembly being so heavily investigated right now,

03:07:44.103 --> 03:07:47.033
we might want to arrange something super secret.

03:07:47.033 --> 03:07:49.823
I don't think we should walk up to the door.

03:07:49.823 --> 03:07:52.304
LIAM: Well, we probably want to have you

03:07:52.304 --> 03:07:53.765
give a little hello, hello.

03:07:53.765 --> 03:07:54.909
SAM: We're doing this today?

03:07:54.909 --> 03:07:56.044
LAURA: No, no, no, no.

03:07:56.044 --> 03:07:58.137
TALIESIN and LAURA: Tomorrow.

03:07:58.137 --> 03:07:58.970
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.
LIAM: And then

03:07:58.970 --> 03:08:01.349
my only other question is,

03:08:01.349 --> 03:08:04.713
that will either succeed or fail, but once we're done,

03:08:04.713 --> 03:08:08.263
are we going straight back into the cold

03:08:08.263 --> 03:08:09.641
or do we want to,

03:08:09.641 --> 03:08:14.641
I can bring you back to see your families for--

03:08:15.229 --> 03:08:16.062
SAM: I think we have-- I mean,

03:08:16.062 --> 03:08:19.359
as much as I would love to and want to--

03:08:19.359 --> 03:08:21.590
TALIESIN: I feel like we should
talk to the Bright Queen as well.

03:08:21.590 --> 03:08:22.759
SAM: Don't we have a ticking clock?

03:08:22.759 --> 03:08:25.119
TRAVIS: Yeah, I think that is part of the cold, I think.

03:08:25.119 --> 03:08:25.952
LIAM: No, no, no.

03:08:25.952 --> 03:08:27.815
It just slipped my mind.

03:08:27.815 --> 03:08:30.369
TALIESIN: It's possible. I know that they
have that floating city.

03:08:30.369 --> 03:08:33.740
Maybe we can get back there and it'll cut down our travel.

03:08:33.740 --> 03:08:35.122
LIAM: But this is still just one,

03:08:35.122 --> 03:08:37.049
we're at the end of one day.

03:08:37.049 --> 03:08:38.709
We're guesstimating a week.

03:08:38.709 --> 03:08:40.549
Even if we take three or four days.

03:08:40.549 --> 03:08:45.182
So tomorrow, I could take us to the Dynasty.

03:08:45.182 --> 03:08:48.319
I could take us also to Nicodranas, if you want,

03:08:48.319 --> 03:08:51.188
and back into the cold, in one day.

03:08:51.188 --> 03:08:53.880
LAURA: Wow.
MARISHA: Nicodranas,

03:08:53.880 --> 03:08:56.868
then Dynasty, and then back into the cold.

03:08:56.868 --> 03:08:58.826
LAURA: Why Nicodranas?

03:08:58.826 --> 03:09:00.017
LIAM: Well.

03:09:00.976 --> 03:09:02.248
MARISHA: What if we don't come back?

03:09:02.248 --> 03:09:03.081
LIAM: Yeah.

03:09:06.386 --> 03:09:07.644
LAURA: Oh gosh.

03:09:10.361 --> 03:09:14.022
LIAM: To be fair, Caduceus, your family as well?

03:09:14.022 --> 03:09:15.855
TALIESIN: I have a plan. We're--

03:09:19.331 --> 03:09:21.446
This sort of thing is something we're comfortable with,

03:09:21.446 --> 03:09:24.296
but I'm planning something.

03:09:25.530 --> 03:09:27.113
Going to be all right.

03:09:28.062 --> 03:09:32.080
MARISHA: If we're not able to take Lucien down here,

03:09:32.080 --> 03:09:36.589
he's taking these threshold crests to the Astral Sea.

03:09:37.942 --> 03:09:40.559
LAURA: We'll have to go to the city.

03:09:42.988 --> 03:09:46.561
Why aren't you guys telling anyone about the eyes on you?

03:09:46.561 --> 03:09:48.081
I understand you wanting to keep it a secret,

03:09:48.081 --> 03:09:49.952
but if there's a way to get them removed

03:09:49.952 --> 03:09:53.011
why aren't you trying to do that?

03:09:53.011 --> 03:09:54.903
LIAM: But it's not a secret from you.

03:09:54.903 --> 03:09:58.332
TALIESIN: Or learning anything about it, having anybody--

03:09:58.332 --> 03:10:03.132
or showing them what happened to you.

03:10:03.132 --> 03:10:04.615
LIAM: Who?

03:10:04.615 --> 03:10:05.506
MARISHA: Trust.

03:10:07.303 --> 03:10:08.702
And it's not trust in them.

03:10:08.702 --> 03:10:10.735
It's trust in us.

03:10:10.735 --> 03:10:12.493
In Caleb and I.

03:10:15.052 --> 03:10:17.332
I don't know, I guess I--

03:10:17.332 --> 03:10:18.823
the fear, as soon as Allura

03:10:18.823 --> 03:10:20.934
could have potentially seen the eyes

03:10:20.934 --> 03:10:21.852
and kicked us out

03:10:21.852 --> 03:10:25.981
quicker than any assistance would have been given.

03:10:25.981 --> 03:10:27.903
LIAM: Or deemed us too dangerous to leave.

03:10:27.903 --> 03:10:28.812
MARISHA: Exactly.

03:10:28.812 --> 03:10:32.229
LIAM: It crossed my mind to tell her, but...

03:10:36.985 --> 03:10:41.415
MARISHA: I'm not against showing people and asking.

03:10:41.415 --> 03:10:43.306
I just want to make sure

03:10:45.231 --> 03:10:47.569
we've got our ducks in a row first.

03:10:47.569 --> 03:10:49.442
TRAVIS: Maybe once.

03:10:49.442 --> 03:10:52.188
The only reason I say that is, if we leave it unchecked

03:10:52.188 --> 03:10:56.358
and it's something that can be used against you or you,

03:10:56.358 --> 03:10:59.917
we'll feel very foolish for as long as we can feel it.

03:10:59.917 --> 03:11:01.989
MARISHA: Well, we we're going back to Nicodranas.

03:11:01.989 --> 03:11:04.711
We could check in with Yussa.

03:11:04.711 --> 03:11:09.169
TRAVIS: Allura and Yussa both seem
to be third parties, as it were.

03:11:09.169 --> 03:11:11.294
You don't work for them and

03:11:11.294 --> 03:11:14.235
they really aren't attached to either of you.

03:11:15.497 --> 03:11:17.484
MARISHA: I'd be willing to talk to Yussa.

03:11:17.484 --> 03:11:18.867
LIAM: That's fair.
MARISHA: And then, yeah.

03:11:18.867 --> 03:11:20.646
LIAM: That's just adding another hour or two

03:11:20.646 --> 03:11:22.667
to our stay in Nicodranas.

03:11:22.667 --> 03:11:24.633
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: Okay.

03:11:24.633 --> 03:11:27.669
TRAVIS: We can show them to Trent
and then just cut his head off.

03:11:27.669 --> 03:11:28.891
TALIESIN: (laughs)

03:11:28.891 --> 03:11:30.726
ASHLEY: I'd be happy to do that.

03:11:30.726 --> 03:11:32.251
TALIESIN: Oh.
LAURA: I would, too.

03:11:32.251 --> 03:11:33.642
TRAVIS: Sorry, poor humor.

03:11:35.402 --> 03:11:40.090
LAURA: You would do it much faster,
though. Mine would be slow.

03:11:40.090 --> 03:11:41.612
ASHLEY: Maybe your way is better.

03:11:41.612 --> 03:11:43.070
LAURA: (laughs)

03:11:47.203 --> 03:11:50.628
LIAM: Well, I'm good to turn in.

03:11:51.525 --> 03:11:54.266
Caduceus, may I see that staff?

03:11:56.470 --> 03:11:57.822
Okay, I will lay it out

03:11:57.822 --> 03:12:00.710
and begin Identifying it.

03:12:00.710 --> 03:12:01.982
MATT: All right.

03:12:01.982 --> 03:12:05.831
It is a-- it is <i>Allura's</i> staff of power.

03:12:05.831 --> 03:12:07.865
LAURA: Woo hoo hoo.
TRAVIS: Shit.

03:12:07.865 --> 03:12:09.467
(laughs)

03:12:09.467 --> 03:12:10.913
MARISHA: It has <i>her</i> name!

03:12:10.913 --> 03:12:12.591
TRAVIS: Gimme the deets!

03:12:12.591 --> 03:12:16.226
SAM: It can cast the cantrip Prestidigitation.

03:12:16.226 --> 03:12:18.280
MATT: You can look up "staff of power."

03:12:18.280 --> 03:12:19.113
LIAM: Yeah.

03:12:19.113 --> 03:12:21.186
MATT: But it is definitively her custom one.

03:12:21.186 --> 03:12:23.510
MARISHA: Bunny!
TRAVIS: Come on, Allura, fuck!

03:12:23.510 --> 03:12:24.930
MARISHA: Confetti!
(laughter)

03:12:24.930 --> 03:12:27.181
TRAVIS: Were we not clear?

03:12:27.181 --> 03:12:28.393
Shit.

03:12:28.393 --> 03:12:30.310
LIAM: So there's not an "Allura's staff of power" here,

03:12:30.310 --> 03:12:32.103
it's "staff of power"?
MATT: It's "staff of power",

03:12:32.103 --> 03:12:36.560
but keep in mind, that shit belongs Allura.

03:12:36.560 --> 03:12:38.899
Much like your sword belongs to Kima.
LAURA: Very rare.

03:12:38.899 --> 03:12:39.732
ASHLEY: Yes.

03:12:39.732 --> 03:12:42.811
SAM: Anyone have dibs on the scepter of blasting,

03:12:42.811 --> 03:12:44.592
the rod of blasting?

03:12:44.592 --> 03:12:46.508
MARISHA: Kind of has your name written all over it.

03:12:46.508 --> 03:12:47.341
SAM: It does.

03:12:48.212 --> 03:12:52.083
May I have your rod, Caleb?

03:12:52.083 --> 03:12:52.916
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

03:12:55.579 --> 03:12:58.678
SAM: And I have to attune to this, Matt?

03:12:58.678 --> 03:12:59.511
MATT: Yes.

03:12:59.511 --> 03:13:04.503
SAM: So I'm going try to put my dagger down.

03:13:05.497 --> 03:13:06.600
MATT: Nah.

03:13:06.600 --> 03:13:08.691
SAM: Yeah, right, it's pretty great.

03:13:08.691 --> 03:13:09.841
MATT: Yeah.
MARISHA: Uh oh.

03:13:09.841 --> 03:13:11.587
Oh no, could you not?

03:13:11.587 --> 03:13:14.387
TRAVIS: Have you not picked up on that?

03:13:14.387 --> 03:13:15.779
MARISHA: Fuck! I didn't know he couldn't--

03:13:15.779 --> 03:13:17.438
SAM: This dagger's pretty cool.

03:13:17.438 --> 03:13:20.447
Maybe someone else should take--
LAURA: I mean, what does the dagger do?

03:13:20.447 --> 03:13:22.007
SAM: Well, it cuts things.

03:13:22.007 --> 03:13:25.110
LAURA: Caleb, does it have any magical abilities?

03:13:25.110 --> 03:13:27.498
SAM: Yeah, it seems to have a little bit of extra damage

03:13:27.498 --> 03:13:29.313
when I hit someone with it, yes.

03:13:29.313 --> 03:13:31.171
LAURA: Caleb, why don't you Identify the dagger

03:13:31.171 --> 03:13:33.067
and see if it's worth getting rid of the dagger

03:13:33.067 --> 03:13:35.198
or using the scepter?
LIAM: What?

03:13:35.198 --> 03:13:36.092
LAURA: Can you look at the scept--

03:13:36.092 --> 03:13:38.625
the dagger that Veth has been using

03:13:38.625 --> 03:13:40.366
and see if it's better than the scepter?

03:13:40.366 --> 03:13:41.199
LIAM: Oh yeah, yeah--

03:13:41.199 --> 03:13:42.259
LAURA: Because I mean, if it's not better

03:13:42.259 --> 03:13:44.716
then why would you want to hold onto it, you know?

03:13:45.758 --> 03:13:47.607
SAM: You okay there, pal?

03:13:47.607 --> 03:13:49.567
LIAM: Yes.
LAURA: What's going on?

03:13:49.567 --> 03:13:50.527
MARISHA: What's it do?

03:13:50.527 --> 03:13:52.105
LAURA: You're looking at the staff of power?

03:13:52.105 --> 03:13:53.651
LIAM: It does a lot.
LAURA: You're pretty--

03:13:53.651 --> 03:13:56.464
TALIESIN: I will admit, I opened it, too. It's a lot.

03:13:56.464 --> 03:13:57.539
LIAM: It's a lot.

03:13:58.745 --> 03:13:59.983
TALIESIN: It's a novel.

03:13:59.983 --> 03:14:02.742
LIAM: It is a wizard's best friend.

03:14:02.742 --> 03:14:04.285
LAURA: Oh.
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

03:14:04.285 --> 03:14:06.227
LAURA: That's a Caleb sort of staff?

03:14:06.227 --> 03:14:07.584
TALIESIN: It might be.

03:14:07.584 --> 03:14:08.566
It depends on whether or not

03:14:08.566 --> 03:14:12.385
you want to go messing with what you got.

03:14:12.385 --> 03:14:14.458
TRAVIS: I guarantee you, he does.
LAURA: Yeah.

03:14:14.458 --> 03:14:15.525
TALIESIN: It's a lot.

03:14:16.525 --> 03:14:18.605
LIAM: Fjord, do you want an Ioun stone?

03:14:18.605 --> 03:14:20.245
(laughter)

03:14:20.245 --> 03:14:22.712
TRAVIS: Oh, it's like that, is it?

03:14:22.712 --> 03:14:23.545
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:14:24.442 --> 03:14:27.103
TRAVIS: I mean-- Yep, yep.

03:14:27.103 --> 03:14:28.522
LIAM: Here.

03:14:28.522 --> 03:14:29.355
SAM: (pop sound)

03:14:29.355 --> 03:14:30.933
LAURA: What is the Ioun stone do?

03:14:30.933 --> 03:14:32.416
TRAVIS: I forget. I gave it as a gift.

03:14:32.416 --> 03:14:35.635
SAM: It stores an extra spell
of some sort of level, I think.

03:14:35.635 --> 03:14:37.651
TRAVIS: I actually thought it made him less squishy.

03:14:37.651 --> 03:14:38.484
MARISHA: Oh shit.
LIAM: It does.

03:14:38.484 --> 03:14:40.376
SAM: Oh, there's different Ioun stones.
MATT: There's different ones, yeah.

03:14:40.376 --> 03:14:43.851
LIAM: I'm going down beneath
a hundred hit points, but it's okay.

03:14:43.851 --> 03:14:45.028
LAURA: What?

03:14:45.028 --> 03:14:46.621
TRAVIS: How far below?

03:14:46.621 --> 03:14:49.241
LIAM: We're going to find out and I'm turning it off.

03:14:49.241 --> 03:14:50.492
MATT: It does require attunement.

03:14:50.492 --> 03:14:52.325
LIAM: 87.
TRAVIS: That's okay.

03:14:52.325 --> 03:14:54.507
I will take off--
LIAM: Back to the basement.

03:14:54.507 --> 03:14:57.412
TRAVIS: -- my ring of fire protection.
SAM: Oh no, Travis.

03:14:57.412 --> 03:14:58.392
TRAVIS: And swallow it.

03:14:58.392 --> 03:15:00.400
(laughter)

03:15:00.400 --> 03:15:03.950
LAURA: I literally have a necklace of plant command,

03:15:03.950 --> 03:15:07.267
which I don't think is going to come in very useful.

03:15:07.267 --> 03:15:08.418
TRAVIS: That you are attuned to?

03:15:08.418 --> 03:15:10.267
LAURA: That I'm attuned to.
TRAVIS: Oh.

03:15:10.267 --> 03:15:13.306
LAURA: Can I wear the ring?
TRAVIS: Sure.

03:15:13.306 --> 03:15:14.756
TALIESIN: Got to punch him in the gut real hard,

03:15:14.756 --> 03:15:16.832
so it comes back up.

03:15:16.832 --> 03:15:18.389
LAURA: Which finger do you want to put it on?

03:15:18.389 --> 03:15:20.225
TRAVIS: The right hand, here you go, zoom.

03:15:20.225 --> 03:15:21.066
LAURA: Thanks.

03:15:21.066 --> 03:15:25.355
SAM: I have this rod if anyone wants it.

03:15:25.355 --> 03:15:27.983
TALIESIN: I want to see that dagger you have.
LAURA: Caleb, will you look at that dagger

03:15:27.983 --> 03:15:29.701
and find out if it's better or not?

03:15:29.701 --> 03:15:31.009
LIAM: Of course.
TRAVIS: Which Ioun stone was it?

03:15:31.009 --> 03:15:32.595
Ioun stone of?

03:15:32.595 --> 03:15:34.949
LIAM: It's of fortitude.
TRAVIS: Thank you.

03:15:34.949 --> 03:15:36.798
SAM: Fjortitude.
LIAM: Increases your constitution.

03:15:36.798 --> 03:15:37.946
TALIESIN: Of Fjord-itude.

03:15:37.946 --> 03:15:40.837
LIAM: It's painful. It's painful to give that up.

03:15:40.837 --> 03:15:41.998
But, man.

03:15:41.998 --> 03:15:43.656
TALIESIN: Of the three things that you have attuned,

03:15:43.656 --> 03:15:44.713
that's the thing to--

03:15:44.713 --> 03:15:46.109
LIAM: Well, I got a ring of evasion,

03:15:46.109 --> 03:15:49.146
which means I succeed every dex save

03:15:49.146 --> 03:15:51.437
I ever make in this game.

03:15:51.437 --> 03:15:53.529
TALIESIN: This staff though, oh no.
MARISHA: That staff is dope.

03:15:53.529 --> 03:15:54.638
It reminds me of Keyleth's.

03:15:54.638 --> 03:15:55.630
MATT: "All of them."

03:15:55.630 --> 03:15:56.996
LIAM: Huh?
MATT: Nothing.

03:15:56.996 --> 03:15:59.817
LIAM: All of them-- yeah. Generally.

03:15:59.817 --> 03:16:00.988
MARISHA: It's cool.

03:16:00.988 --> 03:16:02.998
SAM: You want to look at my dagger?

03:16:02.998 --> 03:16:05.165
LIAM: Sure, I will spend the next 10 minutes

03:16:05.165 --> 03:16:06.836
trying not to look over at the staff

03:16:06.836 --> 03:16:08.904
as I identify the dagger.

03:16:08.904 --> 03:16:09.737
TRAVIS: Okay.
MATT: Okay.

03:16:09.737 --> 03:16:10.768
As soon as he goes to reach for it,

03:16:10.768 --> 03:16:13.004
you instinctually pull the dagger back.

03:16:13.004 --> 03:16:14.378
SAM: Ooh.

03:16:14.378 --> 03:16:16.151
LIAM: Well, why don't you just rest it down

03:16:16.151 --> 03:16:18.727
with your hand on the floor and I will work around it.

03:16:18.727 --> 03:16:20.406
SAM: I'll keep a pinky on it.

03:16:20.406 --> 03:16:21.752
MATT: Make a wisdom saving throw.

03:16:21.752 --> 03:16:23.660
SAM: Oh shit.

03:16:25.333 --> 03:16:27.740
LIAM: (Gollum hissing)

03:16:27.740 --> 03:16:29.206
SAM: 10.
MATT: 10?

03:16:32.402 --> 03:16:33.377
It's fine, you don't need--

03:16:33.377 --> 03:16:34.368
you know what it does.

03:16:35.158 --> 03:16:36.858
SAM: Yeah, you're right.

03:16:36.858 --> 03:16:39.088
It's fine. I've seen it work before.

03:16:39.088 --> 03:16:41.278
It has amazing throwing action

03:16:41.278 --> 03:16:42.528
and when it seems to hit,

03:16:42.528 --> 03:16:45.238
it seems to do an extra little bit of damage,

03:16:45.238 --> 03:16:46.688
so I'm good with it.

03:16:46.688 --> 03:16:50.617
This rod, I don't even really know what Thunderwave is, so.

03:16:50.617 --> 03:16:52.808
TALIESIN: Insight check?

03:16:52.808 --> 03:16:54.010
MATT: Sure, make an insight check.

03:16:54.010 --> 03:16:55.440
SAM: I'm very persuasive.

03:16:55.440 --> 03:16:57.068
ASHLEY: That staff is amazing.

03:17:00.218 --> 03:17:02.638
TALIESIN: Okay, 13.

03:17:02.638 --> 03:17:03.471
MATT: 13.

03:17:03.471 --> 03:17:04.598
Make a deception check.

03:17:04.598 --> 03:17:06.346
LIAM: Man. 87 hit points.

03:17:06.346 --> 03:17:07.468
Oh boy, oh boy.
SAM: Deception.

03:17:07.468 --> 03:17:08.728
MATT: Deception or persuasion, depending on how you--

03:17:08.728 --> 03:17:09.561
SAM: Okay.

03:17:11.758 --> 03:17:12.648
Nine.

03:17:12.648 --> 03:17:14.278
LAURA: (gasps)

03:17:14.278 --> 03:17:15.328
MATT: Seems a little off.

03:17:18.345 --> 03:17:19.548
TRAVIS: Oh boy.

03:17:21.278 --> 03:17:23.081
(whispering) It's a Ring of Fire Resistance.

03:17:23.081 --> 03:17:24.298
LAURA: I put it on.

03:17:24.298 --> 03:17:26.071
TALIESIN: I mean, what does it do?

03:17:27.038 --> 03:17:28.678
SAM: It's a knife!

03:17:28.678 --> 03:17:30.954
You can stab or throw.

03:17:30.954 --> 03:17:33.838
MARISHA: (laughs)

03:17:33.838 --> 03:17:35.638
TALIESIN: Like, you can throw it?

03:17:35.638 --> 03:17:36.471
SAM: Yeah.

03:17:38.836 --> 03:17:39.669
TALIESIN: And that's it?

03:17:39.669 --> 03:17:41.418
It's a throwing knife?

03:17:41.418 --> 03:17:43.467
SAM: You can throw it or stab it.

03:17:43.467 --> 03:17:44.848
LAURA: It doesn't seem better.
TALIESIN: So you can just

03:17:44.848 --> 03:17:46.396
attune to something.

03:17:46.396 --> 03:17:47.771
Then you don't have--

03:17:47.771 --> 03:17:48.604
SAM: No, no, no.

03:17:48.604 --> 03:17:52.148
Like I said, when it hits, it seems to do extra damage.

03:17:52.148 --> 03:17:54.054
It's got some sort of magical qualities to it.

03:17:54.054 --> 03:17:55.248
LAURA: Why don't you have Caleb look at it, then?

03:17:55.248 --> 03:17:56.498
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm not convinced.

03:17:56.498 --> 03:17:57.786
SAM: 'Cause it's awesome!

03:17:57.786 --> 03:17:58.619
I know what it does.

03:17:58.619 --> 03:17:59.544
LIAM: Don't you want to know it

03:17:59.544 --> 03:18:01.698
backwards and forwards?

03:18:01.698 --> 03:18:03.344
SAM: Well, the sharp end's this way.

03:18:03.344 --> 03:18:04.887
(laughter)

03:18:04.887 --> 03:18:06.476
LIAM: Veth.

03:18:06.476 --> 03:18:07.388
Summon your bravery.

03:18:07.388 --> 03:18:09.488
Put it on the floor so I can help you out.

03:18:12.308 --> 03:18:13.141
MATT: Veth goes along with it,

03:18:13.141 --> 03:18:14.398
but for a 10 minute period of time,

03:18:14.398 --> 03:18:15.338
it seems a little too much.

03:18:15.338 --> 03:18:16.804
The ADHD starts kicking in

03:18:16.804 --> 03:18:19.188
and you pull away like, "Nah, it's fine."

03:18:21.518 --> 03:18:23.058
LIAM: Do we need to have Yasha restrain you?

03:18:23.058 --> 03:18:24.108
What's going on here?

03:18:27.188 --> 03:18:28.466
SAM: As if she could.

03:18:28.466 --> 03:18:31.315
(laughter)

03:18:31.315 --> 03:18:32.987
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:18:32.987 --> 03:18:34.568
All right.
LAURA: I'm going to cast

03:18:34.568 --> 03:18:36.848
Command on Veth.

03:18:36.848 --> 03:18:38.583
MARISHA: Not letting it go. Sorry.

03:18:38.583 --> 03:18:40.720
LAURA: And I'm going to say, "Drop it."

03:18:41.658 --> 03:18:43.558
MATT: All right, is that a charisma or wisdom saving throw?

03:18:43.558 --> 03:18:45.998
What is that one?
LAURA: That's a wisdom saving throw.

03:18:45.998 --> 03:18:48.188
MATT: Make a wisdom saving throw.

03:18:48.188 --> 03:18:49.287
SAM: Natural one.

03:18:49.287 --> 03:18:52.723
(laughter)

03:18:52.723 --> 03:18:53.931
MATT: (clanging)
SAM: But wait!

03:18:53.931 --> 03:18:55.450
I can re-roll ones.

03:18:55.450 --> 03:18:56.847
LAURA: (gasps) What?

03:18:56.847 --> 03:18:57.897
(laughter)
LIAM: What a dick!

03:18:57.897 --> 03:19:00.064
TRAVIS: Oh, no, no, no!
(screaming)

03:19:00.064 --> 03:19:01.785
TRAVIS: You used the ability?!

03:19:01.785 --> 03:19:02.618
SAM: Yep!

03:19:02.618 --> 03:19:05.188
TRAVIS: You used it?!
LAURA: You can't just throw it in now!

03:19:05.188 --> 03:19:06.452
SAM: 12.
LAURA: Oh, good.

03:19:06.452 --> 03:19:08.580
(laughter)

03:19:08.580 --> 03:19:11.932
MATT: You're such a dick! (laughs)

03:19:11.932 --> 03:19:12.979
I love it!

03:19:12.979 --> 03:19:13.870
I love it!

03:19:13.870 --> 03:19:14.942
(laughter)

03:19:14.942 --> 03:19:16.858
MARISHA: Oh my god!
TALIESIN: That's amazing.

03:19:16.858 --> 03:19:18.211
MATT: It clatters to the ground

03:19:18.211 --> 03:19:20.168
and you're just standing there in amazement

03:19:20.168 --> 03:19:24.908
that you dropped it, and that's where you are so far.

03:19:24.908 --> 03:19:26.333
LAURA: I'm going to step over and kick it

03:19:26.333 --> 03:19:27.333
farther away from her.

03:19:27.333 --> 03:19:29.288
SAM: How long do I have to obey this command?

03:19:29.288 --> 03:19:30.228
MATT: Six seconds.

03:19:30.228 --> 03:19:31.788
LAURA: Oh, that's it?
SAM: Okay.

03:19:31.788 --> 03:19:33.608
ASHLEY: I'm going to pick it up.
MATT: One round. Yeah.

03:19:33.608 --> 03:19:34.828
ASHLEY: I'm going to pick up the dagger.

03:19:34.828 --> 03:19:38.725
SAM: I'll pull out the crossbow and aim it at you.

03:19:38.725 --> 03:19:40.504
You have my dagger, right?

03:19:40.504 --> 03:19:41.337
Give it back.

03:19:42.868 --> 03:19:44.658
I don't like people stealing from me.

03:19:44.658 --> 03:19:45.802
ASHLEY: I'm not stealing from you.

03:19:45.802 --> 03:19:46.918
SAM: You're stealing from me.

03:19:46.918 --> 03:19:48.118
ASHLEY: I am holding this.

03:19:48.118 --> 03:19:51.008
I will give it back to you when we know

03:19:51.008 --> 03:19:54.048
why you're being so weird.
LAURA: Greater Restoration.

03:19:54.048 --> 03:19:54.881
LIAM: There we go.

03:19:54.881 --> 03:19:59.878
MATT: Okay. Mark off your diamonds.

03:19:59.878 --> 03:20:01.498
LAURA: Oh, jesus.

03:20:01.498 --> 03:20:02.348
TALIESIN: Girl's best friend.

03:20:02.348 --> 03:20:03.568
TRAVIS: Over a dagger.

03:20:03.568 --> 03:20:05.318
LAURA: Over a fucking dagger!

03:20:05.318 --> 03:20:06.268
How much is a fucking--

03:20:06.268 --> 03:20:07.519
100 gold. Okay, that's fine.

03:20:07.519 --> 03:20:09.229
(laughter)

03:20:09.229 --> 03:20:10.575
SAM: That's our Laura Bailey.

03:20:10.575 --> 03:20:12.418
(laughter)

03:20:12.418 --> 03:20:13.868
ASHLEY: I'll get another tomorrow.

03:20:15.588 --> 03:20:18.908
MATT: The intensity immediately fades for a second

03:20:18.908 --> 03:20:20.158
and you're taken aback

03:20:20.158 --> 03:20:23.788
by the fact that you're holding your weapon towards Yasha.

03:20:25.097 --> 03:20:27.078
SAM: Ah! I'm sorry.

03:20:27.078 --> 03:20:28.058
It's been a...

03:20:29.048 --> 03:20:30.748
It's been a long day?

03:20:30.748 --> 03:20:33.153
Um, I'm sorry.

03:20:33.153 --> 03:20:34.841
That was uncalled for, probably.

03:20:35.998 --> 03:20:37.118
ASHLEY: Um.

03:20:38.288 --> 03:20:39.730
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:20:39.730 --> 03:20:40.571
ASHLEY: What is this?

03:20:40.571 --> 03:20:41.796
LAURA: Yasha, put it down.

03:20:43.096 --> 03:20:44.733
SAM: You can't.

03:20:44.733 --> 03:20:47.836
(laughter)

03:20:47.836 --> 03:20:49.118
ASHLEY: It's glued to me!

03:20:49.118 --> 03:20:50.380
SAM: I glued it to you!

03:20:50.380 --> 03:20:52.013
(laughter)

03:20:52.013 --> 03:20:53.188
SAM: (cackles)

03:20:53.188 --> 03:20:55.004
(laughter)
TALIESIN: Knives are the new dicks.

03:20:55.004 --> 03:20:57.012
MARISHA: (laughs) "Knives are the new dicks."

03:20:59.711 --> 03:21:04.711
SAM: I-I-I'm so sorry I pulled a weapon on you.

03:21:04.738 --> 03:21:07.275
ASHLEY: I've done that to you all, so it's fine.

03:21:07.275 --> 03:21:08.915
SAM: That is super true!

03:21:08.915 --> 03:21:09.748
(laughter)

03:21:09.748 --> 03:21:11.098
MARISHA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:21:13.783 --> 03:21:14.808
ASHLEY: Are you okay?

03:21:14.808 --> 03:21:16.988
SAM: I don't know.

03:21:16.988 --> 03:21:17.918
I don't know.

03:21:17.918 --> 03:21:19.670
Am I okay now, DM?

03:21:19.670 --> 03:21:20.503
MATT: Yeah.

03:21:20.503 --> 03:21:22.361
LAURA: What's the dagger?

03:21:22.361 --> 03:21:23.778
LIAM: Well, I have to have it.

03:21:23.778 --> 03:21:25.748
LAURA: Well, I kick it over to you, but don't touch it.

03:21:25.748 --> 03:21:26.834
Can just look at it.

03:21:26.834 --> 03:21:28.795
LIAM: (magical sounds)

03:21:28.795 --> 03:21:30.428
MATT: So you kick it out of Yasha's hands?

03:21:30.428 --> 03:21:31.828
LAURA: Oh, I thought she dropped it!

03:21:31.828 --> 03:21:33.160
MATT: Oh, you dropped it again?
ASHLEY: I dropped it.

03:21:33.160 --> 03:21:33.993
MATT: Okay, then yeah.

03:21:33.993 --> 03:21:36.838
LAURA: I'm just going to step on it and walk while--

03:21:36.838 --> 03:21:37.671
MATT: There you go.

03:21:37.671 --> 03:21:39.638
(laughter)

03:21:39.638 --> 03:21:40.981
MATT: It is a Corecut Dagger.

03:21:41.886 --> 03:21:42.719
It is magical.

03:21:42.719 --> 03:21:44.248
Plus one to hit and damage.

03:21:44.248 --> 03:21:47.818
And when you hit with an attack, you can expend a hit die

03:21:47.818 --> 03:21:50.152
to deal an additional 3d6 necrotic damage.

03:21:50.152 --> 03:21:50.986
TRAVIS and LAURA: Ooh.

03:21:50.986 --> 03:21:52.438
MATT: Which is pretty decent.
LIAM: I feel like we learned that.

03:21:52.438 --> 03:21:53.380
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: Yeah.

03:21:53.380 --> 03:21:54.548
SAM: It's got other things, too.

03:21:54.548 --> 03:21:55.965
MATT: It's also cursed.

03:21:55.965 --> 03:21:57.140
LAURA: "It's also cursed." (laughs)

03:21:57.140 --> 03:21:58.658
LIAM: It doesn't do anything.

03:21:58.658 --> 03:22:00.668
SAM: And every time I've been healing

03:22:00.668 --> 03:22:03.138
I've been marking off a check mark,

03:22:03.138 --> 03:22:06.898
because once I go down below a certain number of heals,

03:22:06.898 --> 03:22:07.731
I die.

03:22:09.058 --> 03:22:11.598
MATT: Whenever you are magically healed while cursed,

03:22:11.598 --> 03:22:13.138
you have to expend a hit die

03:22:13.138 --> 03:22:15.708
in order to regain the lost hit points.

03:22:15.708 --> 03:22:17.108
You have to.

03:22:17.108 --> 03:22:19.208
If at any point you don't have any hit dice to spend

03:22:19.208 --> 03:22:21.790
and you're healed, you immediately die.

03:22:21.790 --> 03:22:23.438
TRAVIS: Oh, cool! (laughs)

03:22:23.438 --> 03:22:24.658
Good, good!

03:22:24.658 --> 03:22:25.848
You attuned to this thing?

03:22:25.848 --> 03:22:26.935
SAM: Uh-huh.
TRAVIS: Cool.

03:22:26.935 --> 03:22:27.898
(laughter)

03:22:27.898 --> 03:22:29.028
TRAVIS: Where did you get it from?

03:22:29.028 --> 03:22:30.168
SAM: I don't remember anymore.

03:22:30.168 --> 03:22:31.425
MATT: From Avantika, I think.

03:22:31.425 --> 03:22:32.443
LAURA: Oh!
SAM: Oh, that's right!

03:22:32.443 --> 03:22:35.239
LIAM: You used Halfling Luck one time to keep it.

03:22:35.239 --> 03:22:36.240
(laughter)

03:22:36.240 --> 03:22:37.073
SAM: It's mine!

03:22:37.073 --> 03:22:38.728
It's mine!
LAURA: (laughs) You asshole.

03:22:38.728 --> 03:22:39.938
SAM: It's mine.

03:22:39.938 --> 03:22:42.168
TRAVIS: Before we get to the wonder staff,

03:22:42.168 --> 03:22:44.888
does anybody have shitty constitution?

03:22:44.888 --> 03:22:46.428
Low con modifier?

03:22:46.428 --> 03:22:49.398
Because the Ioun Stone is dope!
LIAM: It's great.

03:22:49.398 --> 03:22:50.291
It's so good.

03:22:51.688 --> 03:22:53.858
I'm already having buyer's remorse.

03:22:53.858 --> 03:22:55.628
TRAVIS: It gives you a lot of hit points, too.

03:22:55.628 --> 03:22:58.109
I don't really need it.

03:22:58.109 --> 03:23:00.328
TALIESIN: Where's your con at?

03:23:00.328 --> 03:23:02.968
ASHLEY: I'm okay. I have a plus eight.

03:23:02.968 --> 03:23:05.220
TRAVIS: I'm a plus four and it gave me a plus five,

03:23:05.220 --> 03:23:07.923
I think it gives you plus two to your con.

03:23:07.923 --> 03:23:08.904
MATT: It increases your constitution by two.

03:23:08.904 --> 03:23:10.693
LIAM: I am not sure what to do.
TRAVIS: And your hit points.

03:23:10.693 --> 03:23:12.298
MATT: Your hit points would go up by 13.

03:23:12.298 --> 03:23:13.728
SAM: You're considering swapping it back?

03:23:13.728 --> 03:23:14.561
LIAM: Yeah, I don't know,

03:23:14.561 --> 03:23:17.398
because with the Ioun Stone, my con goes up,

03:23:17.398 --> 03:23:21.468
so con checks to hold spells up better.

03:23:21.468 --> 03:23:23.952
I just dropped down to 87 hit points, and that's rough.

03:23:23.952 --> 03:23:25.476
TRAVIS: It's rough.

03:23:25.476 --> 03:23:30.476
LIAM: But the ring will get me out of massive damage.

03:23:30.745 --> 03:23:32.219
MATT: Man, that's a conundrum!

03:23:32.219 --> 03:23:33.368
TALIESIN: What's the third object?

03:23:33.368 --> 03:23:34.648
MATT: That's a conundrum.

03:23:34.648 --> 03:23:35.708
SAM: The third object is the staff!

03:23:35.708 --> 03:23:36.788
LIAM: Oh no.

03:23:36.788 --> 03:23:39.008
No, I have a Stone of Good Luck and
I'm not getting rid of that.

03:23:39.008 --> 03:23:40.672
That ups everything I do.

03:23:40.672 --> 03:23:41.505
Everything.
ASHLEY: I wish you could attune

03:23:41.505 --> 03:23:43.653
to four things!

03:23:43.653 --> 03:23:45.048
SAM: I think there's a feat.
MARISHA: There's a feat.

03:23:45.048 --> 03:23:46.078
LAURA: Yeah.

03:23:46.078 --> 03:23:47.114
TRAVIS: Does anybody have a third item

03:23:47.114 --> 03:23:48.893
that they're kind of eh about?

03:23:48.893 --> 03:23:50.932
LAURA: I mean, I've got this Ring of Fire Resistance.

03:23:50.932 --> 03:23:51.808
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:23:51.808 --> 03:23:56.608
(laughter)

03:23:58.616 --> 03:24:01.334
LIAM: Oh boy.
TRAVIS: Flames on my face!

03:24:01.334 --> 03:24:02.478
LAURA: On the side of my face.

03:24:02.478 --> 03:24:05.888
TALIESIN: Yeah, I've got a Staff of Withering

03:24:05.888 --> 03:24:07.675
that I've used once, just 'cause--

03:24:07.675 --> 03:24:10.025
TRAVIS: Would you like this Ioun Stone?

03:24:10.025 --> 03:24:11.598
TALIESIN: Yeah, maybe.
LAURA: You going to take it back?

03:24:11.598 --> 03:24:13.238
TRAVIS: How many hit points do you have?

03:24:13.238 --> 03:24:14.818
TALIESIN: I have 121 hit points.

03:24:14.818 --> 03:24:16.086
TRAVIS: You can have it if you want.
LAURA: What if you switch the stone

03:24:16.086 --> 03:24:17.778
for the ring?

03:24:17.778 --> 03:24:18.808
ASHLEY: Yeah, I think--

03:24:18.808 --> 03:24:20.528
TALIESIN: Let me double check.

03:24:20.528 --> 03:24:21.737
ASHLEY: My con's a plus two.

03:24:21.737 --> 03:24:23.148
LIAM: Any time a Fireball or anything--
ASHLEY: I don't know what I was looking at.

03:24:23.148 --> 03:24:23.981
TALIESIN: Oh, well then--

03:24:23.981 --> 03:24:26.206
ASHLEY: No, no, no, I think it's going to be--

03:24:26.206 --> 03:24:27.464
LIAM: I'm sure Nonagon's got something

03:24:27.464 --> 03:24:29.047
that could kill me but--

03:24:29.922 --> 03:24:30.755
ASHLEY: I think one of you guys.

03:24:30.755 --> 03:24:33.008
TALIESIN: Just Google Ioun Stone of Fortitude

03:24:33.008 --> 03:24:33.968
and see what it does to you.

03:24:33.968 --> 03:24:36.051
TRAVIS: You took the Blasting--?
ASHLEY: I think--

03:24:36.051 --> 03:24:38.098
SAM: Unless anyone else wants it?
ASHLEY: I don't think I want to attune.

03:24:38.098 --> 03:24:39.408
I think I like what I'm--

03:24:39.408 --> 03:24:40.308
TALIESIN: Where you're at?

03:24:41.899 --> 03:24:43.983
SAM: I can swap with you if you need something.

03:24:43.983 --> 03:24:45.400
TRAVIS: I think I'm going to give that Ioun Stone to him

03:24:45.400 --> 03:24:46.938
'cause I'll have an open attunement slot,

03:24:46.938 --> 03:24:47.771
whatever we come across.

03:24:47.771 --> 03:24:49.061
SAM: You can take this dagger.

03:24:49.061 --> 03:24:49.961
(laughs)

03:24:49.961 --> 03:24:51.742
TRAVIS: What's it do?

03:24:51.742 --> 03:24:54.278
LAURA: No, hold on. I can give you the ring back, Fjord.

03:24:54.278 --> 03:24:55.886
TRAVIS: You're giving my ring back?

03:24:55.886 --> 03:24:57.738
LAURA: That's not-- I just mean--

03:24:57.738 --> 03:24:59.206
You gave it to me because you had the stone,

03:24:59.206 --> 03:25:00.457
and I don't want to take away--

03:25:00.457 --> 03:25:03.197
TRAVIS: Do you want the stone or not, Caduceus?

03:25:03.197 --> 03:25:04.030
TALIESIN: Probably, yeah.

03:25:04.030 --> 03:25:05.118
MARISHA: Are you guys breaking up?

03:25:05.118 --> 03:25:07.468
LAURA: No!
SAM: He's on the market!

03:25:07.468 --> 03:25:10.144
MARISHA: Oh shit, you're giving back the class ring.

03:25:10.144 --> 03:25:12.011
LAURA: No, no! That's not what this is!

03:25:12.011 --> 03:25:14.108
I was just letting you know I will gladly keep it on,

03:25:14.108 --> 03:25:16.126
I just thought you'd want it back--

03:25:16.126 --> 03:25:17.764
TRAVIS: Do you know where my letterman jacket is?

03:25:17.764 --> 03:25:20.128
(laughter)

03:25:20.128 --> 03:25:21.132
SAM: Beau's wearing it.

03:25:21.132 --> 03:25:22.028
MARISHA: Oh shit!

03:25:22.028 --> 03:25:24.287
(laughter)

03:25:24.287 --> 03:25:25.546
TRAVIS: Oh shit, yeah, that's it.

03:25:25.546 --> 03:25:26.388
MARISHA: (surprised noise)

03:25:26.388 --> 03:25:28.058
ASHLEY: How do you spell Ioun?

03:25:28.058 --> 03:25:29.768
MATT: I-O-U-N.

03:25:29.768 --> 03:25:30.748
And there are multiple types.

03:25:30.748 --> 03:25:33.278
Look for the one that gives the constitution bonus.

03:25:33.278 --> 03:25:34.111
TRAVIS: Of Fortitude.

03:25:34.111 --> 03:25:34.944
TALIESIN: Seemed to have lost it.

03:25:34.944 --> 03:25:37.265
LAURA: Let me see what I've got.

03:25:37.265 --> 03:25:39.948
SAM: Caleb, thank you for curing me of my--

03:25:39.948 --> 03:25:41.738
or actually no, Jester.

03:25:41.738 --> 03:25:46.115
Jester, thank you for curing me of my dagger disease.

03:25:46.115 --> 03:25:47.368
LAURA: You're welcome.

03:25:47.368 --> 03:25:49.288
SAM: It was very weird.

03:25:49.288 --> 03:25:52.398
LAURA: Yeah, you were weirder than normal.

03:25:52.398 --> 03:25:53.629
ASHLEY: Which Ioun Stone?

03:25:53.629 --> 03:25:54.462
TALIESIN: Of Fortitude.
SAM: That's weird.

03:25:54.462 --> 03:25:55.295
LAURA: I know.

03:25:56.448 --> 03:25:57.578
SAM: You can use it.

03:25:57.578 --> 03:26:00.058
LAURA: I'm not going to use your stupid cursed dagger.

03:26:00.058 --> 03:26:01.963
SAM: Well, I mean, it's pretty good.

03:26:01.963 --> 03:26:02.796
LAURA: No!

03:26:04.268 --> 03:26:07.268
TALIESIN: It basically just ups your hit points quite a bit,

03:26:07.268 --> 03:26:08.318
if you want it.

03:26:08.318 --> 03:26:10.068
Because hit points for you is great.

03:26:12.178 --> 03:26:13.891
Because you're going to be in the middle of things.

03:26:15.845 --> 03:26:17.098
ASHLEY: I think it's more important that you guys--

03:26:17.098 --> 03:26:19.341
LIAM: What did this baller staff look like again?

03:26:20.298 --> 03:26:22.438
MATT: It's a tall ivory staff

03:26:22.438 --> 03:26:25.338
that has a bunch of gold and silver symbols

03:26:25.338 --> 03:26:27.758
that are carved into it down the side.

03:26:27.758 --> 03:26:32.428
Tightly wrapped faint blue and gold handle

03:26:32.428 --> 03:26:33.428
in the center of it.

03:26:36.283 --> 03:26:37.938
And it has these strips of material

03:26:37.938 --> 03:26:40.697
that dangle from the intricate top of it,

03:26:41.847 --> 03:26:43.198
like three tethered strips

03:26:43.198 --> 03:26:45.668
that just flow as it moves.

03:26:45.668 --> 03:26:47.034
SAM: It's not really your aesthetic, but--

03:26:47.034 --> 03:26:49.096
MATT: It's not your aesthetic at all.
LIAM: Who cares?

03:26:50.808 --> 03:26:51.778
TALIESIN: Jester, you take the stone.

03:26:51.778 --> 03:26:52.938
LIAM: Wrap it in a dirty rag.

03:26:52.938 --> 03:26:53.918
LAURA: I take the stone?

03:26:53.918 --> 03:26:56.040
TALIESIN: You're going to be more in the thick of things.

03:26:56.040 --> 03:26:56.988
LAURA: The Ioun Stone?

03:26:56.988 --> 03:26:59.521
TALIESIN: Yeah, and you have a magic ring, so.

03:27:01.468 --> 03:27:04.165
You can keep wearing the ring.
MATT: You guys can figure this out in time.

03:27:04.165 --> 03:27:05.658
We don't have to banter about this

03:27:05.658 --> 03:27:07.314
for 40 minutes necessarily.

03:27:07.314 --> 03:27:08.578
LAURA: Sorry.

03:27:08.578 --> 03:27:09.411
MATT: It's all right.
LAURA: Sorry, that's probably

03:27:09.411 --> 03:27:10.808
not very interesting to watch. (laughs)

03:27:10.808 --> 03:27:12.418
MATT: No, no, it's okay, I'm just saying

03:27:12.418 --> 03:27:16.351
this is a debate that can continue in between episodes.

03:27:18.656 --> 03:27:23.078
Yasha, the sword that you acquired is a beautiful weapon.

03:27:23.078 --> 03:27:24.041
Beautiful weapon.

03:27:26.308 --> 03:27:28.158
In trying to spend some time with it.

03:27:32.358 --> 03:27:35.451
It's odd, you can sense a strong divinity within it.

03:27:37.228 --> 03:27:41.968
Not unlike some of the sourceless strength

03:27:41.968 --> 03:27:43.398
that comes from the Storm Lord.

03:27:43.398 --> 03:27:48.359
There is a connection with this blade and divine power,

03:27:48.359 --> 03:27:50.500
There is a connection with this blade and divine power,

03:27:50.500 --> 03:27:52.098
but you're having a hard time

03:27:52.098 --> 03:27:54.588
finding a point of connection with it.

03:27:54.588 --> 03:27:56.898
Almost like you can sense it's there,

03:27:56.898 --> 03:27:59.198
but as soon as you try and

03:28:01.768 --> 03:28:04.671
connect with and utilize that power, it resists.

03:28:10.658 --> 03:28:12.858
Leaving you with a faint sense of rejection.

03:28:16.460 --> 03:28:17.293
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:28:26.448 --> 03:28:27.963
MATT: Is there anything else anyone would like to do

03:28:27.963 --> 03:28:30.188
before the night has come to an end?

03:28:30.188 --> 03:28:31.728
LIAM: One last thing I want to do.

03:28:31.728 --> 03:28:34.118
I'm going to pull out the collar

03:28:34.118 --> 03:28:35.708
from inside the Folding Halls

03:28:35.708 --> 03:28:38.078
and the power source and try to tinker with it a little bit

03:28:38.078 --> 03:28:39.211
before falling asleep.

03:28:40.518 --> 03:28:42.581
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: To try to get it charged up.

03:28:43.898 --> 03:28:45.898
MATT: Great, go make an arcana check for me.

03:28:50.779 --> 03:28:52.418
LIAM: It's okay.

03:28:52.418 --> 03:28:53.288
18.

03:28:53.288 --> 03:28:54.121
MATT: 18.

03:28:57.598 --> 03:28:59.478
You can see where the fitting will go together.

03:28:59.478 --> 03:29:01.858
There's something you're missing.

03:29:01.858 --> 03:29:04.728
It should be functioning, and it's that frustrating aspect

03:29:04.728 --> 03:29:07.958
where you just keep repeating the puzzle combination

03:29:07.958 --> 03:29:08.958
over and over again.

03:29:10.659 --> 03:29:12.698
By all accounts, it should be working, but it's not

03:29:12.698 --> 03:29:13.698
and it's racking your brain.

03:29:13.698 --> 03:29:14.908
You end up staying up a little bit later

03:29:14.908 --> 03:29:17.128
than you anticipate, the insomnia, the frustration

03:29:17.128 --> 03:29:18.451
kicking into your brain.

03:29:20.098 --> 03:29:22.908
Not tonight, but soon.

03:29:22.908 --> 03:29:23.741
Soon, hopefully.

03:29:24.718 --> 03:29:26.209
You feel it's that little bit of a faint electrical sense

03:29:26.209 --> 03:29:30.284
You feel it's that little bit of a faint electrical sense

03:29:30.284 --> 03:29:33.078
of being on the cusp of discovery, but you're not there yet.

03:29:33.078 --> 03:29:34.528
LIAM: What am I missing?
MATT: Yeah.

03:29:35.738 --> 03:29:38.648
MARISHA: While Caleb is futzing with that,

03:29:38.648 --> 03:29:41.458
I completely disregard his focus

03:29:41.458 --> 03:29:44.888
and just start talking to him a little

03:29:44.888 --> 03:29:46.243
before everyone goes to bed.

03:29:46.243 --> 03:29:48.818
Or I wait for people to clear into their chambers.

03:29:48.818 --> 03:29:51.538
I want to try and get a quiet moment with Caleb.

03:29:51.538 --> 03:29:52.898
LIAM: Work.

03:29:52.898 --> 03:29:54.508
MARISHA: Real quick.
LIAM: Work.

03:29:54.508 --> 03:29:56.061
MARISHA: Just two seconds.

03:29:57.138 --> 03:29:57.971
LIAM: Yeah, go.

03:29:59.418 --> 03:30:01.278
MARISHA: So tomorrow night,

03:30:01.278 --> 03:30:02.638
if we're going to be in Nicodranas,

03:30:02.638 --> 03:30:07.638
I'd kind of like to do the date thing, you know, with Yasha.

03:30:07.738 --> 03:30:09.221
LIAM: Got to do the math on that.

03:30:09.221 --> 03:30:11.496
MARISHA: Uh-huh. So I was just wondering if, you know...

03:30:11.496 --> 03:30:12.588
You know, we're going to be in Nicodranas,

03:30:12.588 --> 03:30:15.992
but I kind of have this big idea for the tower.

03:30:15.992 --> 03:30:19.528
If we could still borrow it for the night?

03:30:19.528 --> 03:30:20.478
LIAM: The whole tower?

03:30:20.478 --> 03:30:22.238
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:30:22.238 --> 03:30:23.928
LIAM: You want the whole tower?

03:30:23.928 --> 03:30:26.738
MARISHA: Well, other people
can stay in it, but, like--

03:30:26.738 --> 03:30:28.112
LIAM: No, no, no, I'm into it.

03:30:28.112 --> 03:30:30.688
MARISHA: If other people wanted to stay in their rooms,

03:30:30.688 --> 03:30:32.651
but as long as they stay in their rooms.

03:30:33.738 --> 03:30:35.046
But I don't have to, you know, I don't want to be...

03:30:35.046 --> 03:30:36.328
LIAM: What if you took the whole tower?

03:30:36.328 --> 03:30:38.148
MARISHA: I would love to take the whole tower.

03:30:38.148 --> 03:30:39.828
LIAM: Okay, yeah.

03:30:39.828 --> 03:30:42.778
I'll talk the others into

03:30:42.778 --> 03:30:47.368
using the material plane

03:30:47.368 --> 03:30:48.218
with the dome or something.

03:30:48.218 --> 03:30:50.418
MARISHA: It's the Lavish Chateau, we'll be there.

03:30:50.418 --> 03:30:51.251
LIAM: Yeah.

03:30:51.251 --> 03:30:53.188
MARISHA: I'll pay for everyone's room

03:30:53.188 --> 03:30:56.508
if people will fuck off so that we could use the tower.

03:30:56.508 --> 03:30:59.062
LIAM: Okay.
SAM: So that you can fuck off.

03:30:59.062 --> 03:31:00.728
LIAM: One requirement.

03:31:00.728 --> 03:31:01.918
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:31:01.918 --> 03:31:04.618
LIAM: Do not go poking about the eighth floor.

03:31:04.618 --> 03:31:07.618
MARISHA: I promise you I will not
go poking about the eighth floor.

03:31:09.488 --> 03:31:10.728
LIAM: Okay, good enough.

03:31:10.728 --> 03:31:13.458
MARISHA: Hey, if I wanted to make some adjustments to it,

03:31:13.458 --> 03:31:15.548
how do I get those to you?

03:31:15.548 --> 03:31:17.304
Should I write them down?

03:31:17.304 --> 03:31:19.548
(laughter)

03:31:19.548 --> 03:31:21.147
You know, just little tweakies.

03:31:21.147 --> 03:31:22.638
Just little ones for the night.

03:31:22.638 --> 03:31:23.868
Just for the night.
LIAM: Yeah, sure.

03:31:23.868 --> 03:31:26.298
Do you want to write those out for me?

03:31:26.298 --> 03:31:28.098
Yes.
LIAM: Yeah, okay.

03:31:28.098 --> 03:31:29.138
MARISHA: I'll do that.

03:31:29.138 --> 03:31:31.175
And I'll just slide it over to you.

03:31:31.175 --> 03:31:32.166
LIAM: Give it to me in the morning.

03:31:32.166 --> 03:31:33.418
MARISHA: Okay. Okay.
LIAM: And I will, you know,

03:31:33.418 --> 03:31:35.848
think on it, process it, get it ready.

03:31:35.848 --> 03:31:36.681
MARISHA: Thank you.

03:31:36.681 --> 03:31:38.058
LIAM: With the old imagination.

03:31:38.058 --> 03:31:40.154
MARISHA: Can the cats be ninjas?

03:31:40.154 --> 03:31:42.040
(laughter)

03:31:42.040 --> 03:31:44.865
Just five of them, not all of them.

03:31:44.865 --> 03:31:47.958
LIAM: T-T-There's a few ways to interpret that.

03:31:47.958 --> 03:31:49.628
Do you want cat ninjas

03:31:49.628 --> 03:31:51.857
or do you want ninjas instead of cats?

03:31:51.857 --> 03:31:54.107
(laughter)

03:31:55.138 --> 03:31:56.262
Because I can do it.

03:31:56.262 --> 03:31:58.158
(laughter)

03:31:58.158 --> 03:31:59.828
I don't like to tinker with

03:31:59.828 --> 03:32:03.848
the size of the transportation system for them.

03:32:03.848 --> 03:32:07.445
So I would prefer that most of them be smaller ninjas

03:32:07.445 --> 03:32:08.818
if they're to be ninjas.

03:32:08.818 --> 03:32:10.678
But maybe you mean ninja cats?

03:32:10.678 --> 03:32:14.300
MARISHA: Well, I don't want to feel like I'm punting a cat.

03:32:14.300 --> 03:32:18.488
I want to be able to just have fun fighting some ninjas.

03:32:18.488 --> 03:32:20.937
LIAM: You want to fight ninja?

03:32:20.937 --> 03:32:23.651
(laughter)

03:32:23.651 --> 03:32:25.528
MARISHA: Just, like, five of them!

03:32:25.528 --> 03:32:28.144
LIAM: So top of the list--
TRAVIS: Best fucking thing.

03:32:28.144 --> 03:32:30.258
LIAM: -- shinobi in the tower.

03:32:30.258 --> 03:32:31.268
Okay.

03:32:31.268 --> 03:32:32.598
MARISHA: I have a bunch of other stuff, too.

03:32:32.598 --> 03:32:34.503
Not a bunch, just a handful of other things.

03:32:34.503 --> 03:32:37.724
TRAVIS: "I want to fight some ninjas." (laughs)

03:32:37.724 --> 03:32:42.131
LIAM: Okay, it can be done, but sleep on it, right?

03:32:42.131 --> 03:32:44.198
SAM: Great date.
(laughter)

03:32:44.198 --> 03:32:47.128
LIAM: Tell me if you need the cats removed for the evening.

03:32:47.128 --> 03:32:48.038
MARISHA: I've got an idea for that.

03:32:48.038 --> 03:32:50.268
LIAM: Okay. You don't have to--

03:32:50.268 --> 03:32:51.459
I just need it by the morning.

03:32:51.459 --> 03:32:52.628
MARISHA: Okay, okay.
LIAM: Okay?

03:32:52.628 --> 03:32:54.288
MARISHA: Okay.

03:32:54.288 --> 03:32:55.728
Thank you.

03:32:55.728 --> 03:32:57.208
LIAM: Yeah, of course.

03:32:57.208 --> 03:32:59.391
MARISHA: Are you cool? You good, yeah?

03:33:00.568 --> 03:33:01.401
LIAM: Yes.

03:33:04.678 --> 03:33:06.248
MARISHA: I'll let you get back to work.

03:33:06.248 --> 03:33:07.691
LIAM: Okay. I've almost got it.

03:33:08.848 --> 03:33:09.778
MARISHA: Don't stay up too long.

03:33:09.778 --> 03:33:12.898
It's been a never-ending day.

03:33:12.898 --> 03:33:15.558
LIAM: Promise, I'm about to turn in.

03:33:15.558 --> 03:33:16.868
I spend the next hour working on it.

03:33:16.868 --> 03:33:17.701
MATT: Okay.

03:33:18.948 --> 03:33:21.018
All right.
MARISHA: I slink back to my chambers.

03:33:21.018 --> 03:33:22.478
MATT: Eventually, you all find yourselves

03:33:22.478 --> 03:33:25.368
in your respective rooms, resting in the comfort

03:33:27.248 --> 03:33:29.458
of The Cobalt Soul Archive of Rexxentrum.

03:33:32.640 --> 03:33:33.673
Caduceus.

03:33:33.673 --> 03:33:34.506
TALIESIN: Mm?

03:33:37.998 --> 03:33:40.646
MATT: In the midst of your comfortable sleep,

03:33:40.646 --> 03:33:43.271
imagery begins to swim through your mind.

03:33:46.768 --> 03:33:47.601
Home.

03:33:50.378 --> 03:33:52.378
The comfort of the Grove.

03:33:52.378 --> 03:33:54.471
It's been awhile, it's been so long.

03:33:57.858 --> 03:33:59.108
You're there with family.

03:34:01.235 --> 03:34:02.893
You miss it, you miss them.

03:34:04.448 --> 03:34:06.998
And just reminds you of where you came from

03:34:08.508 --> 03:34:11.331
and how far you've come since you journeyed outward.

03:34:15.508 --> 03:34:17.316
You can see the crystalline structures

03:34:17.316 --> 03:34:21.466
You can see the crystalline structures

03:34:21.466 --> 03:34:25.088
that have grown from the seeds you crafted

03:34:25.088 --> 03:34:27.508
with the guidance of the Wild Mother.

03:34:27.508 --> 03:34:31.184
The darkness of the Savalirwood at bay.

03:34:32.538 --> 03:34:33.371
And you...

03:34:36.068 --> 03:34:38.508
You sense something odd in the air.

03:34:42.448 --> 03:34:46.071
The trees seem to be getting closer.

03:34:48.398 --> 03:34:53.383
The light, choked and fleeting.

03:34:54.498 --> 03:34:56.891
You look towards these branches

03:34:56.891 --> 03:35:01.891
and they reach out like ever-grasping fingers.

03:35:02.245 --> 03:35:04.669
The branch creaking.

03:35:05.828 --> 03:35:09.151
The barrier that was built holds.

03:35:11.308 --> 03:35:13.071
Then the trees change.

03:35:13.928 --> 03:35:15.831
Bark becomes flesh,

03:35:17.358 --> 03:35:19.361
branch becomes arm,

03:35:21.988 --> 03:35:26.988
stone and skin twist and push

03:35:27.158 --> 03:35:29.961
and break the boundaries you've built.

03:35:31.568 --> 03:35:36.568
You see cobblestone flow up from beneath the ground.

03:35:36.968 --> 03:35:39.538
A city street made of teeth

03:35:40.418 --> 03:35:44.021
as it begins to devour your family from beneath.

03:35:45.528 --> 03:35:47.818
This forest of flesh

03:35:51.628 --> 03:35:55.144
consumes everything.

03:36:02.432 --> 03:36:03.265
MATT: Yasha.

03:36:08.558 --> 03:36:09.988
SAM: Same dream, but it's sexy.

03:36:09.988 --> 03:36:11.518
MATT: Yeah, exact same.

03:36:11.518 --> 03:36:12.851
ASHLEY: The trees are like...

03:36:12.851 --> 03:36:15.101
(laughter)

03:36:16.398 --> 03:36:17.398
LIAM: Covered in ninjas.

03:36:18.478 --> 03:36:20.331
ASHLEY: Dreams of ninjas for some reason.

03:36:22.858 --> 03:36:26.328
MATT: So many dreams you've had in your life

03:36:27.278 --> 03:36:30.958
resemble echoed moments in your past

03:36:31.968 --> 03:36:35.688
walking aimless in a dark expanse.

03:36:35.688 --> 03:36:39.418
Open, broken fields of Xhorhas greeting you directionless

03:36:39.418 --> 03:36:42.884
towards jagged horizons

03:36:42.884 --> 03:36:45.225
with no idea or purpose.

03:36:46.208 --> 03:36:48.238
Being filled with some semblance

03:36:48.238 --> 03:36:49.728
of divinity in your blood,

03:36:49.728 --> 03:36:52.861
given no charge, nothing to protect.

03:36:54.758 --> 03:36:56.941
Failing to have protected.

03:36:59.488 --> 03:37:00.571
But in this dream,

03:37:02.888 --> 03:37:05.601
you feel the comfort of a path before you.

03:37:06.688 --> 03:37:09.736
The broken fields you used to walk

03:37:10.988 --> 03:37:14.528
give way to grass

03:37:20.748 --> 03:37:23.728
and you feel the comforting sensation

03:37:23.728 --> 03:37:26.551
of fields beneath your feet, between your toes.

03:37:28.328 --> 03:37:31.428
A similar sensation when you first crossed paths,

03:37:31.428 --> 03:37:36.428
the Ashkeeper Peaks and stepped within the Zemnian fields.

03:37:43.438 --> 03:37:45.613
You look ahead and see,

03:37:45.613 --> 03:37:50.528
placed within the dirt and stone,

03:37:50.528 --> 03:37:52.778
a familiar platinum blade

03:37:56.515 --> 03:38:01.515
and it radiates warmth and comfort

03:38:01.531 --> 03:38:03.456
and silent strength.

03:38:07.048 --> 03:38:09.748
And you begin to hear thunder rolling in the distance.

03:38:11.798 --> 03:38:14.105
Clouds begin to swell in the sky.

03:38:14.105 --> 03:38:17.938
(thunder roaring)

03:38:20.318 --> 03:38:21.251
Flashes.

03:38:22.238 --> 03:38:23.588
The rain begins to pour

03:38:25.528 --> 03:38:27.358
and you look beyond the blade

03:38:27.358 --> 03:38:30.061
and you see six familiar shapes.

03:38:31.708 --> 03:38:32.541
Friends.

03:38:33.938 --> 03:38:35.521
The Nein.

03:38:36.361 --> 03:38:39.510
And they call out to you, "Save us."

03:38:41.558 --> 03:38:42.858
And you look to this blade

03:38:44.508 --> 03:38:46.378
and you know it could possibly

03:38:46.378 --> 03:38:47.758
give you the strength to do that

03:38:47.758 --> 03:38:50.211
and as you run towards it, it moves further away.

03:38:53.346 --> 03:38:55.198
And you run even harder.

03:38:55.198 --> 03:38:58.488
Feet slick against the mud, you push.

03:38:58.488 --> 03:39:01.598
Your breath coming out in gasping heaves,

03:39:01.598 --> 03:39:04.978
your chest in pain, the heat of the exhaustion,

03:39:04.978 --> 03:39:06.138
but the more you run,

03:39:06.138 --> 03:39:08.288
the more the blade just seems to coast away

03:39:09.138 --> 03:39:10.788
with the shadows of your friends.

03:39:11.756 --> 03:39:13.278
(thunder clapping)

03:39:13.278 --> 03:39:14.858
Lightning strikes the dirt beside you,

03:39:14.858 --> 03:39:19.141
you're thrown 15 feet, hit the ground, spin, stop.

03:39:23.608 --> 03:39:25.458
As you lay onto your back looking up,

03:39:26.658 --> 03:39:29.158
the rain begins to stop and in the clouds

03:39:29.158 --> 03:39:30.811
you see a face emerge.

03:39:32.388 --> 03:39:36.561
Eyes of crackling lightning, a stern brow,

03:39:37.868 --> 03:39:39.981
a bearded face made of cloud.

03:39:43.108 --> 03:39:45.356
All at once you feel the Storm Lord's presence

03:39:45.356 --> 03:39:46.796
looking down upon you.

03:39:52.685 --> 03:39:56.653
"You found your strength, Yasha.

03:40:01.400 --> 03:40:02.233
"Now,

03:40:05.983 --> 03:40:09.391
"you must learn to use it.

03:40:15.828 --> 03:40:20.818
"You are not an implement of others.

03:40:20.818 --> 03:40:21.651
"You are not an implement of others.

03:40:23.298 --> 03:40:25.991
"You've broken those chains.

03:40:28.768 --> 03:40:31.051
"You are an avatar of the Storm Lord.

03:40:31.051 --> 03:40:36.001
"You are an avatar of the Storm Lord.

03:40:41.508 --> 03:40:44.649
"I work through you,

03:40:44.649 --> 03:40:48.324
"but your strength is your own.

03:40:55.358 --> 03:40:58.866
"You've begun the first steps,

03:40:58.866 --> 03:41:03.341
"but you must earn this one."

03:41:05.470 --> 03:41:09.270
And the clouds darken,

03:41:09.270 --> 03:41:11.520
and you slip into darkness.

03:41:19.108 --> 03:41:19.941
Caleb.

03:41:21.998 --> 03:41:22.831
Beauregard.

03:41:23.899 --> 03:41:25.198
SAM: Oh no.

03:41:25.198 --> 03:41:26.098
LIAM: That other shoe.

03:41:27.668 --> 03:41:30.821
MATT: You've had a night of rest filled with anxiety,

03:41:33.638 --> 03:41:36.058
but no visitation, no dreams.

03:41:36.058 --> 03:41:40.128
Inside of a cold mountain in Eiselcross,

03:41:40.128 --> 03:41:44.891
in hot pursuit of that which you chased and then ran from.

03:41:49.318 --> 03:41:53.241
So you hope for another night of similar comfort.

03:41:55.008 --> 03:41:56.508
And when the shadow takes you,

03:41:59.288 --> 03:42:02.938
not one but two red eyes...

03:42:04.056 --> 03:42:07.098
(eyes appearing)

03:42:07.098 --> 03:42:08.581
appear in shadow around you.

03:42:13.525 --> 03:42:16.461
"Another finds finds us. (echoing)

03:42:17.588 --> 03:42:20.263
"Finds their way home. (echoing)"

03:42:22.628 --> 03:42:26.108
The two eyes drift around, peering from different angles

03:42:26.108 --> 03:42:29.551
as you sit there floating in shadow.

03:42:32.248 --> 03:42:34.951
"Welcome. (echoing)

03:42:36.218 --> 03:42:39.211
"We dream with you. (echoing)

03:42:40.278 --> 03:42:44.181
"Dreams are the first step. (echoing)

03:42:46.758 --> 03:42:49.041
"We can make dreams into anything.

03:42:50.772 --> 03:42:52.091
"Anything.

03:42:54.104 --> 03:42:56.101
"Into everything.

03:42:59.031 --> 03:43:00.989
"Together."

03:43:02.928 --> 03:43:07.722
Third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth eye.

03:43:07.722 --> 03:43:10.302
And you hear the screams again.

03:43:10.302 --> 03:43:15.224
(shadowy screaming)

03:43:15.224 --> 03:43:17.982
(shadowy screaming)

03:43:19.434 --> 03:43:20.701
We'll end the episode there tonight.

03:43:20.701 --> 03:43:24.024
(groaning)

03:43:24.024 --> 03:43:25.118
ASHLEY: Oh my god!

03:43:25.118 --> 03:43:27.887
LAURA: That was so creepy sounding, Matt.

03:43:27.887 --> 03:43:29.678
MATT: Thank you.

03:43:29.678 --> 03:43:30.868
ASHLEY: What?!

03:43:32.068 --> 03:43:34.245
I have goosebumps!
TRAVIS: Wow.

03:43:34.245 --> 03:43:36.575
LIAM: (like Stefon from SNL) This episode had everything.

03:43:36.575 --> 03:43:38.556
(laughter)

03:43:38.556 --> 03:43:39.438
SAM: It really did.

03:43:39.438 --> 03:43:41.673
TALIESIN: I had old friends.

03:43:41.673 --> 03:43:44.273
SAM: We're going to all the continents.

03:43:44.273 --> 03:43:47.794
LIAM: (like Stefon) It had humor, it had magical items,

03:43:47.794 --> 03:43:49.370
it had terrible dreams!
ASHLEY: It had vestiges!

03:43:49.370 --> 03:43:50.428
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:43:50.428 --> 03:43:53.289
LIAM: It had ninja cats on a date night.

03:43:53.289 --> 03:43:55.276
ASHLEY: (groan of frustration)

03:43:55.276 --> 03:43:56.836
MATT: We'll pick up from there next week.

03:43:56.836 --> 03:43:58.002
TRAVIS: Two eyes, huh?

03:43:58.002 --> 03:44:00.704
LAURA: Two eyes? Or is it going to be all nine eyes!

03:44:00.704 --> 03:44:02.178
TRAVIS: Of course it is!

03:44:02.178 --> 03:44:03.011
MARISHA: It's got to be, right?

03:44:03.011 --> 03:44:04.320
TRAVIS: Of course it is!

03:44:04.320 --> 03:44:06.391
We ain't shown nobody.

03:44:06.391 --> 03:44:09.103
LAURA: You're turning into one of them.

03:44:09.103 --> 03:44:11.868
TRAVIS: Tick-tock, tick-tock.

03:44:11.868 --> 03:44:13.895
ASHLEY: Let's just keep playing.

03:44:13.895 --> 03:44:15.323
(laughter)

03:44:15.323 --> 03:44:17.938
Just, like, 30 more minutes.

03:44:17.938 --> 03:44:18.971
TRAVIS: We can do an eight-hour game, right?

03:44:18.971 --> 03:44:20.636
MARISHA: A few more minutes, dad!

03:44:20.636 --> 03:44:22.778
MATT: Nah, nah.

03:44:22.778 --> 03:44:26.308
We had a five-hour game a couple of weeks back.

03:44:26.308 --> 03:44:28.968
TRAVIS: That staff better have eye removal in that bitch.

03:44:28.968 --> 03:44:31.178
TALIESIN: Dude, that staff is so clutch.

03:44:31.178 --> 03:44:33.468
ASHLEY: That staff is dope.
TALIESIN: Holy shit.

03:44:33.468 --> 03:44:36.463
MATT: And it's on loan.

03:44:36.463 --> 03:44:38.332
(laughter)

03:44:38.332 --> 03:44:39.358
LIAM: You'll never see me again,

03:44:39.358 --> 03:44:41.358
I'm living in the dream land now.

03:44:41.358 --> 03:44:44.008
(laughter)

03:44:44.008 --> 03:44:45.781
Don't make me sing, don't make me sing.

03:44:45.781 --> 03:44:48.031
(laughter)

03:44:49.618 --> 03:44:51.258
MATT: All righty, everyone.

03:44:51.258 --> 03:44:56.258
Well, you can figure out your list of tower modifications

03:44:56.328 --> 03:44:58.678
and what magical items have decided to be attuned

03:44:58.678 --> 03:45:00.278
over the next week.

03:45:00.278 --> 03:45:01.188
We'll pick it up then.

03:45:01.188 --> 03:45:03.438
In the meantime, have a wonderful night.

03:45:03.438 --> 03:45:04.618
Thank you all for joining us.

03:45:04.618 --> 03:45:05.678
We love you very much.

03:45:05.678 --> 03:45:07.468
And is it Thursday yet?

03:45:07.468 --> 03:45:08.369
Good night.

03:45:08.369 --> 03:45:09.369
(cheering)

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.494
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:04.494 --> 00:00:06.535
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:06.535 --> 00:00:09.055
TRAVIS: (slurred) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:09.055 --> 00:00:12.565
MATT: We're going to have Laura Bailey joining us
as soon as she comes in. She's coming in hot from

00:00:12.565 --> 00:00:15.548
work, but she'll be here soon enough.

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:17.399
LIAM: Excellent mime work.

00:00:17.399 --> 00:00:20.225
MATT: If worse comes to worst, Taliesin will
obviously fill in.

00:00:20.225 --> 00:00:23.973
TALIESIN: (high-pitched voice) Hey! Hey guys! Oh
god, let her never see that.

00:00:23.973 --> 00:00:32.054
MATT: She's in traffic watching right now going,
"I'm going to fucking kill him." Hi, Laura! Before

00:00:32.054 --> 00:00:36.247
we get into tonight's episode, let's get through
our announcements for the evening. First off, we

00:00:36.247 --> 00:00:40.017
have two wonderful sponsors tonight, beginning
with our first sponsor, our continuing

00:00:40.017 --> 00:00:42.544
relationship with our friends at D&amp;D Beyond.

00:00:42.544 --> 00:00:45.301
ALL: D&amp;D Beyond!

00:00:45.301 --> 00:00:51.335
SAM: D&amp;D Beyond, everybody, they're a great
organization. Here's the truth of the matter. I

00:00:51.335 --> 00:01:00.182
wrote a piece tonight that featured heavily Laura
Bailey, but she's not here. We even had music for

00:01:00.182 --> 00:01:02.064
it. Guys, hit that music.

00:01:02.064 --> 00:01:03.994
[epic music]

00:01:03.994 --> 00:01:06.845
SAM: Yeah, it was going to be great.

00:01:06.845 --> 00:01:08.714
TRAVIS: Y'all going to hype me to death?

00:01:08.714 --> 00:01:15.673
SAM: It was going to be pretty epic, but she's not
here, so I can't do it. I wrote another thing. I

00:01:15.673 --> 00:01:22.984
thought, tonight, I could go to the D&amp;D Beyond
webpage on my iPad here and read some stuff off of

00:01:22.984 --> 00:01:30.329
their FAQ or their About Us because I don't have
anything planned. I'm going to go to my browser

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:37.244
right now. This is going to be fine! I was just
there earlier today, so I'll fire it up. Okay,

00:01:37.244 --> 00:01:42.754
here it is. FurryDate is a matchmaking website for
the furry community. If you're looking for a furry

00:01:42.754 --> 00:01:49.693
friend-- that is not-- that must have been another
site that wound up on my browser somehow. I will

00:01:49.693 --> 00:01:56.634
go further back in the history a little bit. Oh!
Oh boy, that's a lot of skin. I think this site

00:01:56.634 --> 00:02:05.755
might be called Double D Beyond. Okay, it's a lot
of pop-ups. I'll click on Install on all of them

00:02:05.755 --> 00:02:07.243
to make them go away.

00:02:07.243 --> 00:02:09.575
TRAVIS: Family show. Family show, Sam.

00:02:09.575 --> 00:02:17.953
SAM: Okay, they're gone. This is great. This one's
great. It's not what I was looking for, but

00:02:17.953 --> 00:02:24.591
there's this kid David, and he just went to the
dentist. It looks like he's talking real funny.

00:02:24.591 --> 00:02:33.232
But that's not it. I'm going to go back a little.
I'm trying to get back in the history to the website.

00:02:33.244 --> 00:02:35.547
MARISHA: Have you been on YouTube since 2007?

00:02:35.547 --> 00:02:41.434
SAM: I just got to something. Apparently I owe the
IRS some money, and I have to go to Target to buy

00:02:41.644 --> 00:02:43.821
a gift card to send it to them.

00:02:43.821 --> 00:02:45.274
TRAVIS: I don't think that's real. I think
that's--

00:02:45.274 --> 00:02:50.342
SAM: I think that's real. I might need to go after
the show. Oh, and here we go! Okay. D&amp;D Beyond is

00:02:50.342 --> 00:02:54.064
an amazing website that lets you create and store
your characters, load up digital books and

00:02:54.064 --> 00:02:59.401
campaign guides, view stats for monsters, and so
much more. Plus, they have a great theme song.

00:02:59.401 --> 00:03:03.710
Check them out. Show them the Critter love. Wish
them a merry Christmas with the hashtag

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.765
#BrianFosterSmellsLikeCabbage. That's all I got.

00:03:06.765 --> 00:03:11.794
TRAVIS: Beautiful. Maybe erase your browser
history.

00:03:11.794 --> 00:03:13.959
SAM: I don't think I can because I've lost control
of this whole thing.

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:18.444
MARISHA: That is a company laptop. Pointing that
out.

00:03:18.444 --> 00:03:19.585
TRAVIS: You're fired.

00:03:19.585 --> 00:03:21.483
MATT: Thank you, Sam.

00:03:21.483 --> 00:03:22.401
SAM: Close.

00:03:22.401 --> 00:03:27.830
MATT: Thank you, Sam, and thank you, D&amp;D Beyond.
Our second sponsor tonight is our fantastic

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.822
friends returning from The Rook &amp; The Raven. The
Rook &amp; The Raven, you've seen us discuss their

00:03:32.822 --> 00:03:37.658
work before. They do fantastic campaign notebooks
for when you're running a campaign or for your

00:03:37.658 --> 00:03:42.170
player characters to keep track of. Fantastic
Kickstarters throughout the year. The entire month

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.008
of December is dedicated to their school kit
charity drive. We've discussed it before, and

00:03:47.008 --> 00:03:51.306
we're bringing it back. They're donating a hundred
percent of their December profits to teachers,

00:03:51.306 --> 00:03:55.318
schools, and community centers to help them
establish and grow tabletop gaming clubs and

00:03:55.318 --> 00:04:02.711
classes. To help create a space for the young
generation to come and enjoy these games in a way

00:04:02.711 --> 00:04:08.291
that we never could growing up because this shit
was considered evil or a thing you don't do. That

00:04:08.291 --> 00:04:13.105
has changed dramatically now. Allowing these
spaces for more kids to get into the space, to

00:04:13.105 --> 00:04:17.022
meet friends, to learn social skills, to learn
creative writing, all the different things that

00:04:17.022 --> 00:04:21.341
are so fantastic about playing these games,
they're helping doing it. Each of these adventure

00:04:21.341 --> 00:04:27.556
club gaming kits will contain dice, books for a
table of six-- so that's a DM and five players.

00:04:27.556 --> 00:04:33.399
Every item sold from now until January 20th will
not only add to the number of kits they can send,

00:04:33.399 --> 00:04:37.233
but will also count towards leveling up the
contents of each kit to include additional

00:04:37.233 --> 00:04:42.447
notebooks, sourcebooks, and adventures. Give the
gift of gaming right now at

00:04:42.447 --> 00:04:49.683
therookandtheraven.com/criticalrole. Be sure to
follow them on Twitter @therookandtheraven for

00:04:49.683 --> 00:04:53.592
giveaways, which they do often. Thank you very
much, friends, for coming along with us again.

00:04:53.864 --> 00:04:57.573
Happy new year to everything and the wonderful
things you're doing for these wonderful kids.

00:04:57.573 --> 00:04:58.428
Thank you.

00:04:58.428 --> 00:05:01.453
TRAVIS: That's incredible. Five players is a lot.
Phew, that's good.

00:05:01.453 --> 00:05:02.861
MATT: Yeah, imagine more.

00:05:02.861 --> 00:05:07.292
TRAVIS: Matt, why do you make things so evil?

00:05:07.292 --> 00:05:13.392
MATT: We announced at our State of the Role, on
our channel, we have a bunch of new shows like Pub

00:05:13.392 --> 00:05:19.031
Draw with Babs Tarr. MAME Drop we've continued
into a show that's coming out in the new year, in

00:05:19.031 --> 00:05:21.584
which we play a bunch of random games on the MAME
Cabinet you got to see built as part of All Work

00:05:21.584 --> 00:05:28.701
No Play! Check out details on those upcoming shows
at critrole.com. This is our last episode of

00:05:28.701 --> 00:05:30.423
Critical Role of 2018, folks.

00:05:30.423 --> 00:05:32.121
TRAVIS: Oh man, how did that happen?

00:05:32.121 --> 00:05:34.962
MATT: I know, it's nuts. The campaign's gone a
year.

00:05:34.962 --> 00:05:37.685
LIAM: No one die in the last one of 2018. Don't
die!

00:05:37.685 --> 00:05:39.802
TALIESIN: But then you'd have so much time to come
up with a new character.

00:05:39.802 --> 00:05:42.972
MATT: That is true. If there was a night to do it,
this is the time.

00:05:42.972 --> 00:05:46.639
LIAM: We're closing in on four years.

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:48.411
TALIESIN: What? No.

00:05:48.411 --> 00:05:50.642
TRAVIS: That's insane.

00:05:50.642 --> 00:05:57.169
LIAM: That is correct. Almost four years of D&amp;D
here. Hmm. Feels good.

00:05:57.169 --> 00:05:58.272
TALIESIN: That's crazy.

00:05:58.272 --> 00:06:04.422
MATT: That's nuts. Well, they're not sick of us
yet, hopefully. But yes, we'll be back from our

00:06:04.422 --> 00:06:08.943
holiday break January 10th. That will be our
returning episode, so mark it on your calendars.

00:06:08.943 --> 00:06:14.979
We look forward to seeing you then. Also, be sure
to tune in Tuesday, January 8th, 2019 for a very

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:20.089
special, campaign-as-it-currently-lies Talks
Machina, where most of the cast will be there to

00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:26.354
discuss things that have happened, questions they
may have. I won't answer most of them because I'm

00:06:26.354 --> 00:06:32.621
a dick. It's going to be fun! We're going to
discuss all things that have happened and answer

00:06:32.621 --> 00:06:39.111
your guys' questions. Make sure you don't miss
that on January 8th at 7:00pm Pacific. Also,

00:06:39.111 --> 00:06:40.182
tomorrow night.

00:06:40.182 --> 00:06:41.213
LIAM: Tomorrow night!

00:06:41.213 --> 00:06:45.421
MATT: Tomorrow night, Liam's fantastic Nightmare
Before Critmas one-shot is airing at 7:00pm

00:06:45.421 --> 00:06:53.432
Pacific, here at twitch.tv/criticalrole, with the
VOD going up Sunday the 23rd, this very weekend.

00:06:53.432 --> 00:06:58.382
So to prepare you right for the Christmas holiday,
or far after any holidays you may be celebrating,

00:06:58.382 --> 00:07:01.430
or anything in between, whatever it may be, this
is going to be a fun one-shot.

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.610
LIAM: It was a thing. It was very special.

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:08.341
TRAVIS: It was a lot of fun.

00:07:08.341 --> 00:07:17.971
MATT: Yes, stuff went down. So enjoy. It was a
wonderful way to kick off the holiday. Unless I am

00:07:17.971 --> 00:07:20.643
mistaken, that is the last of our announcements.

00:07:20.643 --> 00:07:21.879
TRAVIS: Aw shit.

00:07:21.879 --> 00:07:27.910
MATT: With that, friends, let's jump into
tonight's episode of Critical Role.

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:30.590
MARISHA: (singing) Critical Role!

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:34.772
[water bubbling]

00:07:34.772 --> 00:07:38.281
[thunder]

00:07:38.281 --> 00:07:40.441
[explosion]

00:07:40.441 --> 00:07:44.930
(chanting) Role! Critical! Role!

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:52.917
[dramatic Critical Role theme]

00:07:52.917 --> 00:08:01.973
LAURA: Roll the dice! (singing) The adventure
begins, they were always beside you, your nerdy

00:08:01.973 --> 00:08:08.967
best friends, and the DM to guide you. And they
rise from the flames for the battles ahead.

00:08:08.967 --> 00:08:13.420
Villains beware 'cause you're about to be dead.

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:23.270
ASHLEY: (singing) They got magic and flair, they
got falchions and cunning. They don't see over

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:31.088
there there's a monster incoming. Inspiration is
waiting, rise up, don't think twice. Put your fate

00:08:31.088 --> 00:08:34.415
in your hands, take a chance, roll the dice!

00:08:34.415 --> 00:08:43.130
(chanting) Role! Critical! Role!

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:48.181
ASHLEY and LAURA: (singing) Can you answer the
call? Diggin' deep in your soul as the legend

00:08:48.181 --> 00:08:59.105
unfolds. Now it's your turn to roll!

00:08:59.105 --> 00:09:06.225
[fire burning]

00:09:06.225 --> 00:09:14.034
MATT: Welcome back. Last we left off, The Mighty
Nein had been making their way through the Swavain

00:09:14.034 --> 00:09:20.624
Islands in the Lucidian Ocean after vanishing from
the island of Darktow with the damaged

00:09:20.624 --> 00:09:23.855
Squalleater, renaming it the Balleater.

00:09:23.855 --> 00:09:25.601
TRAVIS: As you do.

00:09:25.601 --> 00:09:32.430
MATT: As you do. Managed to escape from the
Diver's Grave and the ship graveyard that turned

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:38.740
out to be, as well as the entity that lived there.
You had acquired another sphere of Uk'otoa--

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:40.961
ALL: (whispering) Uk'otoa.

00:09:40.961 --> 00:09:42.230
MATT: Every time.

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:44.461
LIAM: Uk'otoa? (parrot caw)

00:09:44.461 --> 00:09:49.804
MARISHA: Who brought a fucking parrot? Damn it,
Jester.

00:09:49.804 --> 00:09:55.934
MATT: Upon making your way to the Bisaft Isle to
get repairs for your ship as it limps along the

00:09:55.934 --> 00:10:03.869
ocean, you discovered that you had a stowaway who
had followed you on the ship since Darktow. The

00:10:03.869 --> 00:10:10.325
delightful gnome named Twiggy befriended you and
revealed the item which had sent her on her path

00:10:10.325 --> 00:10:16.610
to becoming a stowaway, the strange clockwork
arcane sphere that she seemed to have stolen from

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:22.468
an auction house to keep away from a bad man. Upon
toying with this sphere, you discovered that it

00:10:22.468 --> 00:10:30.061
seemed to have some sort of planar elements, bits
of conjuration magic to it, and was dispensing

00:10:30.061 --> 00:10:38.624
coins and cold weather attire. A little more
tweaking sent you somewhere else. The present

00:10:38.624 --> 00:10:46.050
party was transported to some extra-planar
dungeon, if you will, an abode of a hundred plus

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:51.461
rooms that apparently belonged to a mage from long
ago. Upon exploring and making your way through

00:10:51.461 --> 00:10:59.221
the various traps and tricks, you managed to avoid
a few pitfalls, trigger a few others, gather a few

00:10:59.221 --> 00:11:08.143
objects, fight a cabinet, find some books, and end
up teleported in a scattered fashion into the

00:11:08.143 --> 00:11:09.961
realm of a young blue dragon.

00:11:09.961 --> 00:11:11.340
LIAM: A lot happened real fast.

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:19.140
MATT: Yeah. For two of you, by the skin of your
fucking teeth, you all managed to figure out the

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:23.971
way to trigger the exit and escape in time, with
Twiggy dealing a final blow to the dragon on the

00:11:23.971 --> 00:11:30.170
way out, of which some of you may believe her, as
no one was present to watch it happen. After

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:35.331
which, you made your way-- you realized you'd been
missing for six days, that there was some time

00:11:35.331 --> 00:11:40.600
dilation between the time you spent in the sphere,
or at least within a few chambers in the sphere,

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:44.034
versus the time out here. The crew had been
waiting for a number of days. The repairs had been

00:11:44.034 --> 00:11:52.210
completed on Bisaft Isle. You guys decided to call
it an evening and rest up, lick your wounds, and

00:11:52.210 --> 00:12:00.079
reflect over what had transpired in the past day,
the past week, the past month, who knows. With

00:12:00.079 --> 00:12:08.642
most of you going to a rest, and Beau and Caduceus
heading up to the top of the ship to calm and

00:12:08.642 --> 00:12:15.383
discuss these things, you all called it a night.
So Mighty Nein, as you are still at dock on Bisaft

00:12:15.383 --> 00:12:18.878
Isle, what would you like to do the following
morning?

00:12:18.878 --> 00:12:22.172
TRAVIS: That's what I was going to ask. What time
is it?

00:12:22.172 --> 00:12:26.782
MATT: Let's say it's a long night's sleep, because
there's a lot of recovery. So I'll say, without

00:12:26.782 --> 00:12:33.435
any sort of necessary reference to wake you up for
an early point, you sleep in till near noon.

00:12:33.435 --> 00:12:35.406
MARISHA: Perfect timing!

00:12:35.406 --> 00:12:38.818
LAURA: Hi, guys!

00:12:38.818 --> 00:12:40.621
ALL: Hi, Laura!

00:12:40.621 --> 00:12:42.990
LIAM: Now we're complete.

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:43.868
LAURA: Mostly.

00:12:43.868 --> 00:12:47.420
TRAVIS: We just started and we slept in all the
way till noon.

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:50.221
LAURA: Yeah, that would be really nice.

00:12:50.221 --> 00:12:54.006
TRAVIS: You can take your backpack off.

00:12:54.006 --> 00:12:55.726
LAURA: I know.

00:12:55.726 --> 00:13:04.510
TRAVIS: Well, I suppose we should mosey out and
get the lay of the land, as it were.

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:07.114
SAM: Okay, Wilford Brimley.

00:13:07.114 --> 00:13:11.496
TRAVIS: I don't know why I'm like this. I slept
real heavy, mm-kay?

00:13:11.496 --> 00:13:16.404
(laughter)

00:13:16.404 --> 00:13:18.870
SAM: Yes, we should go walk around.

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:22.292
TALIESIN: I could use some solid land. That'd be
nice.

00:13:22.292 --> 00:13:24.266
LAURA: Whose donut is this?

00:13:24.266 --> 00:13:27.140
SAM: That's mine; this one's yours.

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:30.221
LAURA: Sweet! Keep going, guys.

00:13:30.221 --> 00:13:32.464
MATT: The one that says: This is Laura's; don't
fucking touch--

00:13:32.464 --> 00:13:34.384
LAURA I didn't know there was a donut in there; it
just said Don't Touch.

00:13:34.384 --> 00:13:36.311
TRAVIS: What else could it be?

00:13:36.311 --> 00:13:38.193
SAM: Before dinner?

00:13:38.193 --> 00:13:39.252
LAURA: (mouth full) Yeah.

00:13:39.252 --> 00:13:42.232
MATT: To be fair, that's one of the perks of being
an adult.

00:13:42.232 --> 00:13:47.480
SAM: That's true. Caleb, did you want to maybe
look at some books before we leave?

00:13:48.967 --> 00:13:52.610
LIAM: Do you know anything about this island? Is
it large?

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:57.169
MATT: You know a little bit. You've passed here
once or twice. It's the largest of a set of four

00:13:57.169 --> 00:14:02.953
parallel islands, but for the most part, it's not
really cultivated. The jungles here are fairly

00:14:02.953 --> 00:14:08.939
thick. The fruit trees and exotic creatures make
it an interesting pass-by port, but also a

00:14:08.939 --> 00:14:16.486
dangerous thing to push into. The thick mangrove
trees choke most of the coastal areas except for

00:14:16.486 --> 00:14:22.188
on the south, which is where the actual town of
Bisaft Port is, which is where you guys are

00:14:22.188 --> 00:14:29.582
currently set. You do know that, because it's
cluttered, it tends to be a favorite spot for

00:14:29.582 --> 00:14:32.667
contraband out in the jungle, but the creatures
that live there are pretty dangerous, so most

00:14:32.667 --> 00:14:39.047
people avoid that. There are some remaining signs
of the Ki'Nau people that used to be indigenous to

00:14:39.047 --> 00:14:46.099
these islands before they all became part of the
Clovis Concord. That's about all you know. I mean,

00:14:46.099 --> 00:14:49.066
it's a small village, maybe 800 people or so.

00:14:49.066 --> 00:14:58.022
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll relay all that stuff in my own
tongue and say: I'm sure there's stuff. It grows a

00:14:58.022 --> 00:15:04.206
little bit each time I come by here, so there
could be new stuff I haven't seen before. Worth a look.

00:15:04.206 --> 00:15:11.295
LIAM: Mm-hmm. I think that I will stay behind on
the boat but I think you should go. If you see any

00:15:11.295 --> 00:15:15.356
incense, I would appreciate it if you picked some
up.

00:15:15.356 --> 00:15:20.500
SAM: You're going to just stay? Are you going to
go look through the stuff that we got?

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:22.235
LIAM: Yeah, probably. Ja.

00:15:22.235 --> 00:15:24.891
SAM: Do you want me to stay with you?

00:15:24.891 --> 00:15:27.255
LIAM: (clears throat)

00:15:27.255 --> 00:15:34.423
TALIESIN: Well at the very least, maybe you should
have Nott try and open some of those funny locks

00:15:34.423 --> 00:15:38.254
on the books before we go so that you have an
easier time getting into them.

00:15:38.254 --> 00:15:39.688
LIAM: Did we not open them?

00:15:39.688 --> 00:15:42.632
TALIESIN: I don't think we opened the individual
locks on the books. I think you just grabbed

00:15:42.632 --> 00:15:43.571
locked books.

00:15:43.571 --> 00:15:50.900
MATT: Not all of them. I think a few of them were.
Part of the locking mechanism was embedded in the shelf.

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:53.456
LIAM: I think I actually will be all right,
though.

00:15:53.456 --> 00:15:58.001
TALIESIN: Oh! And I grab this one, too. There was
one more that you didn't get to see.

00:15:58.001 --> 00:15:59.669
SAM: Oh! Thank you! Yes!

00:15:59.669 --> 00:16:04.813
TALIESIN: I don't know what it is. I just picked
it up. Seemed like the thing to do.

00:16:04.813 --> 00:16:06.411
LIAM: Thank you.

00:16:06.411 --> 00:16:07.897
TALIESIN: Yeah, anytime.

00:16:07.897 --> 00:16:11.499
TRAVIS: What about paper? Aren't you always
needing papier?

00:16:11.499 --> 00:16:19.415
LIAM: I don't get the sense that a lot of
high-quality paper and ink makes it to this

00:16:19.415 --> 00:16:23.179
island, but I have been wrong before, so if you
see any would you bring some back and I will

00:16:23.179 --> 00:16:24.251
reimburse you?

00:16:24.251 --> 00:16:25.689
TRAVIS: Yeah, of course!

00:16:25.689 --> 00:16:28.175
LIAM: I'm just going to take it easy today.

00:16:28.175 --> 00:16:31.385
TRAVIS: All right, fair enough. Where's Jester?

00:16:31.385 --> 00:16:35.608
LAURA: I'm coming downstairs.

00:16:35.608 --> 00:16:37.272
SAM: Downstairs?

00:16:37.272 --> 00:16:40.170
LAURA: Yeah. Downstairs from my upstairs cabin.

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:41.889
SAM: Sure, sure.

00:16:41.889 --> 00:16:42.476
MATT: Sure.

00:16:42.476 --> 00:16:47.078
SAM: There's just one above-deck cabin.

00:16:47.078 --> 00:16:49.228
LAURA: I slept in the crow's nest.

00:16:49.228 --> 00:16:52.588
TRAVIS: How are you doing this morning, Jester?

00:16:52.588 --> 00:16:56.457
LAURA: (heavy sigh) I'm okay.

00:16:56.457 --> 00:16:57.649
TRAVIS: Yeah?

00:16:57.649 --> 00:16:59.301
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

00:16:59.301 --> 00:17:02.206
TRAVIS: You want to go out and explore a little
bit?

00:17:02.206 --> 00:17:03.624
LAURA: Sure.

00:17:03.624 --> 00:17:15.013
TRAVIS: Are you okay? I know the day's escapades
were a bit much. Little close.

00:17:15.013 --> 00:17:19.787
LAURA: It was a lot, yes. You disappeared, Fjord.

00:17:19.787 --> 00:17:25.695
TRAVIS: Yeah, well you did, too. Every time I
popped into wherever I was, I could see you pop in

00:17:25.695 --> 00:17:31.200
and then pop out and I kept wanting to go make
sure you knew we were getting the fuck out.

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:35.117
LAURA: Oh, right. In the dragon room, too. I was
talking about in the library, though.

00:17:35.117 --> 00:17:41.873
TRAVIS: Oh. Yeah, well it was the damnedest thing.
I just touched it. Like, you know. Didn't know if

00:17:41.873 --> 00:17:49.097
it was rough or smooth or cold. Didn't expect to
be like (glass shattering) ah! None of that shit. Boop!

00:17:49.097 --> 00:17:50.735
LAURA: Yeah.

00:17:50.735 --> 00:17:54.415
TRAVIS: Maybe I won't do that so much anymore.

00:17:54.415 --> 00:17:58.547
LAURA: Sometimes you just need to touch things.

00:17:58.547 --> 00:18:07.036
TRAVIS: Yeah! What are you grinning at, goblin?

00:18:07.036 --> 00:18:12.635
SAM: Nothing. You have a compulsion. I just think
it's funny.

00:18:12.635 --> 00:18:15.426
MARISHA: You are a bit handsy sometimes.

00:18:15.426 --> 00:18:22.624
TRAVIS: Are we not all intrigued by things that
don't belong or seem out of place?

00:18:22.624 --> 00:18:27.376
LIAM: Yeah, but you know, I don't offer a lot of
muscle to this group but I do have a little bit of

00:18:27.376 --> 00:18:33.585
knowledge. So, you know, in situations like that
just give me a moment to have a look around the

00:18:33.585 --> 00:18:37.226
room, please, Fjord. Yes, thank you, Beauregard.

00:18:37.226 --> 00:18:38.951
TRAVIS: Yes, that's fair.

00:18:38.951 --> 00:18:52.721
MARISHA: I mean, it's hard because I do pretty
reckless things. I don't know. I honestly feel

00:18:52.721 --> 00:19:01.133
like everyone feels terrible about how that went,
but you know, when you look at on the whole, we

00:19:01.133 --> 00:19:02.568
did okay.

00:19:02.568 --> 00:19:06.768
LAURA: Twiggy said that the dragon is actually
dead now.

00:19:06.768 --> 00:19:08.443
MARISHA: I believe her, actually.

00:19:08.443 --> 00:19:13.626
TRAVIS: I didn't even ask. What was in the room
before I got ripped out of there?

00:19:13.626 --> 00:19:15.499
LAURA: Lots of books.

00:19:15.499 --> 00:19:16.962
TALIESIN: Angry furniture.

00:19:16.962 --> 00:19:26.524
LAURA: Oh, yeah. A cabinet swallowed Nott, no,
Twiggy. It all kind of ran together.

00:19:26.524 --> 00:19:28.014
TALIESIN: A lot happened.

00:19:28.014 --> 00:19:29.669
LIAM: Lot of books.

00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:38.782
TALIESIN: There was a doll, too, if I recall.
There was a doll, there were some marbles, dust, a

00:19:38.782 --> 00:19:39.422
lot of books.

00:19:39.422 --> 00:19:41.266
SAM: Oh yeah, we got a thing of marbles and a
thing of ink.

00:19:41.266 --> 00:19:44.096
TALIESIN: Ooh, did you get the marbles and the
ink? That's nice.

00:19:44.096 --> 00:19:48.780
TRAVIS: Wait a minute. When I disappeared, you
didn't immediately come and try and find me? You

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:49.809
went and got stuff?

00:19:49.809 --> 00:19:51.221
LAURA: I did. Beau did.

00:19:51.221 --> 00:19:54.849
TALIESIN: Honestly, we were trying to figure out
what had happened.

00:19:54.849 --> 00:19:55.586
TRAVIS: Hmm.

00:19:55.586 --> 00:20:03.996
SAM: Caleb and I knew where you were and wanted to
ascertain...

00:20:03.996 --> 00:20:11.681
MARISHA: Yeah. Honestly man, when you did that you
were totally alone and by yourself. It took us a

00:20:11.681 --> 00:20:14.849
minute to figure out what exactly had happened and
what you touched.

00:20:14.849 --> 00:20:19.412
LIAM: Yeah, maybe you were locked behind something
or there was some way to release it in the room.

00:20:19.412 --> 00:20:24.857
LAURA: Yeah, it wasn't like everybody left you.
You left us.

00:20:24.857 --> 00:20:25.852
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's true.

00:20:25.852 --> 00:20:30.854
TALIESIN: My mother was a big believer in the
buddy system. Growing up in the woods, buddy

00:20:30.854 --> 00:20:33.912
system. Always should have a buddy.

00:20:33.912 --> 00:20:38.333
SAM: Should we all have a buddy? Should we call
these now? I call Caleb.

00:20:38.333 --> 00:20:39.336
TALIESIN: We know.

00:20:39.336 --> 00:20:45.995
SAM: Well I just wanted to make sure that I got
Caleb, but you guys, maybe you should buddy up for

00:20:45.995 --> 00:20:47.253
future encounters.

00:20:47.253 --> 00:20:51.080
TRAVIS: How about I just keep my hands in my
pockets going forward into strange new rooms by

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.489
long-dead wizards, potentially.

00:20:53.489 --> 00:20:58.499
SAM: Good luck. You can't fight a compulsion,
man.

00:20:58.499 --> 00:21:01.300
LAURA: You would know, right?

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:04.065
SAM: I know. Get that itch. Got to scratch it.

00:21:04.065 --> 00:21:06.246
TRAVIS: I think I got a button around here
somewhere.

00:21:06.246 --> 00:21:06.799
SAM: Ooh!

00:21:06.799 --> 00:21:07.843
MARISHA: Jester.

00:21:07.843 --> 00:21:08.449
LAURA: Mm?

00:21:08.449 --> 00:21:19.329
MARISHA: I hope you know, my intention wasn't to
abandon anybody, especially not you. I thought I

00:21:19.329 --> 00:21:24.549
was going to have to activate the damn sphere and
it was going to open up a portal or something. I

00:21:24.549 --> 00:21:29.905
didn't know it was going to immediately take me
away from the fight. I'm sorry.

00:21:29.905 --> 00:21:39.773
LAURA: Of course! Really, I was invisible, you
guys. I wasn't there.

00:21:41.963 --> 00:21:44.146
SAM: So we're all still friends?

00:21:44.146 --> 00:21:49.436
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah, okay. Oh, I see this, yeah.

00:21:49.436 --> 00:21:51.298
LAURA: You were in a wall, dude.

00:21:51.298 --> 00:21:52.566
TALIESIN: I was in a wall.

00:21:52.566 --> 00:21:54.304
LAURA: That's pretty cool.

00:21:54.304 --> 00:22:02.187
TALIESIN: Yeah. I think that everybody here thinks
that this is their fault. Raise your hand if you

00:22:02.187 --> 00:22:05.065
think what happened yesterday was your fault.

00:22:05.065 --> 00:22:07.353
MARISHA: I mean, I might have a part in it.

00:22:07.353 --> 00:22:11.330
LAURA: I mean, partially. If I'd have done better
against the dragon--

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:13.627
SAM: I didn't do anything wrong!

00:22:13.627 --> 00:22:18.216
TALIESIN: What do I roll?

00:22:18.216 --> 00:22:19.719
MARISHA: I think that's true.

00:22:19.719 --> 00:22:21.425
MATT: Insight, sure.

00:22:21.425 --> 00:22:24.373
LAURA: I don't need an insight check. I believe
it.

00:22:24.373 --> 00:22:24.897
TALIESIN: 18.

00:22:24.897 --> 00:22:27.495
SAM: I don't think I did anything wrong!

00:22:27.495 --> 00:22:35.246
TALIESIN: I usually find that if everybody thinks
that they're the ones that did something wrong,

00:22:35.246 --> 00:22:41.626
it's because nobody did everything wrong. You just
had a string of luck. I think everybody did really good.

00:22:41.626 --> 00:22:43.368
MARISHA: I agree with that.

00:22:43.368 --> 00:22:47.764
TALIESIN: I think that we all got out of there. I
think that we all tried our best and we're going

00:22:47.764 --> 00:22:51.127
to do better next time. I'm feeling very
positive.

00:22:51.127 --> 00:22:53.782
TRAVIS: Thank you, yeah!

00:22:53.782 --> 00:22:55.347
SAM: That's a great pep talk.

00:22:55.347 --> 00:22:57.735
TRAVIS: Need that uplifting-- yeah!

00:22:57.735 --> 00:22:59.631
TALIESIN: You survived a dragon.

00:22:59.631 --> 00:23:04.515
LIAM: Also, we're giving you a hard time, but
there was no reason why I needed to keep fiddling

00:23:04.515 --> 00:23:13.045
with this thing, and I pat the satchel that I have
the ball in. Could have left it well enough alone.

00:23:13.045 --> 00:23:15.963
TRAVIS: I appreciate that.

00:23:15.963 --> 00:23:24.914
TALIESIN: You took a risk. Risks are okay. Got to
be careful what risks you take, but without risks,

00:23:24.914 --> 00:23:27.486
we're never going to get what we want.

00:23:27.486 --> 00:23:32.030
MARISHA: That's a good point. What do we want?

00:23:32.030 --> 00:23:37.165
TALIESIN: Well, I think we want breakfast.

00:23:37.165 --> 00:23:42.396
MARISHA: Yeah. Get off this godforsaken boat for a
damn minute.

00:23:42.396 --> 00:23:44.505
TALIESIN: Then we can have a talk about that.

00:23:44.505 --> 00:23:49.576
TRAVIS: That is a great idea. In fact, you should
lead the way. I have a feeling you'll be able to

00:23:49.576 --> 00:23:50.766
find the best spot.

00:23:50.766 --> 00:23:53.238
TALIESIN: Excellent. I don't actually even know
how to get off this boat. We haven't done it

00:23:53.439 --> 00:23:54.417
properly in so long.

00:23:54.417 --> 00:23:57.747
TRAVIS: Oh, the gangplanks, it's right over there.
First mate, show them how!

00:23:57.747 --> 00:24:02.781
MARISHA: Okay. Do I show them how? Am I first
mate-y enough?

00:24:02.781 --> 00:24:03.989
MATT: You've learned enough, yes.

00:24:03.989 --> 00:24:05.503
TALIESIN: Roll for first mate.

00:24:05.503 --> 00:24:08.987
TRAVIS: Do you know where the fucking exit is?
Because I might not.

00:24:08.987 --> 00:24:14.641
MATT: You have proficiency bonus. Okay, so you
guys head back up to the deck and over towards the

00:24:14.641 --> 00:24:21.957
dock. Couple of things you notice. One, you
haven't really been out of the ship to see the

00:24:21.957 --> 00:24:28.068
port. By the time you guys returned it was
nighttime and didn't have, really, a good view, as

00:24:28.068 --> 00:24:31.877
at night on this island, there really isn't a lot
of light; it shuts down at dusk.

00:24:31.877 --> 00:24:33.272
MARISHA: You're talking about Bisaft?

00:24:33.272 --> 00:24:47.168
MATT: Bisaft. There's a lot of ships. Probably
about 20 or so. They're mainly Concord military

00:24:47.168 --> 00:24:56.804
vessels, similar to the one you saw and avoided on
the outskirts of Nicodranas. Glancing over, there

00:24:56.804 --> 00:25:01.608
are a few groups of soldiers on the docks
stretching. Looks like they're loading supplies

00:25:01.608 --> 00:25:07.600
into the ships. They're making a stop and the
ships are waiting for others to fill up because

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:12.767
it's a small dock. It's mainly meant to maintain,
at most, six or seven ships at a time, so they're

00:25:12.767 --> 00:25:20.722
having to go in waves to take supplies and they're
probably cleaning out some of what Bisaft Port has.

00:25:20.722 --> 00:25:29.104
TRAVIS: As we make our way by, can I identify a
low-ranking member of one of the crewmen of one of

00:25:29.104 --> 00:25:32.138
those ships as they're, perhaps, reaching for a
bundle or something?

00:25:32.138 --> 00:25:38.859
MATT: Sure, yeah. There's a number you can go
ahead and stop. There's one of them nearby that is

00:25:38.859 --> 00:25:42.850
sitting there stretching legs and gathering their
supplies in a small sack. They probably bought a

00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:44.780
few things to take on the path.

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:49.222
TRAVIS: You there! By gods, you guys are stocking
up something fierce!

00:25:49.222 --> 00:25:54.764
MATT: "Yes, we are making our way through the
waters. This is just a quick stop."

00:25:54.764 --> 00:25:58.894
TRAVIS: Amazing. Do you mind if I ask where all
this traffic is going?

00:25:58.894 --> 00:26:06.845
MATT: "Well, with the recent attacks, the war at
the Empire, it's getting a little hairy, so the

00:26:06.845 --> 00:26:14.876
"Marquis Olesya Lapidus is calling many of the
warships to the southern coast to be a precaution

00:26:14.876 --> 00:26:15.979
"near the border."

00:26:15.979 --> 00:26:20.729
TRAVIS: Oh, I understand. I'm sorry to hear it's
moving so aggressively. Are you concerned, or do

00:26:20.729 --> 00:26:22.562
you feel strength in your numbers?

00:26:22.562 --> 00:26:27.451
MATT: (noncommittal consideration) "This is a
conflict between them, but it is still important

00:26:27.451 --> 00:26:35.132
"to be careful. We have an alliance from a trade
standpoint with the Empire, but they are not

00:26:35.132 --> 00:26:41.270
"entirely the most pleasant people, so they can
deal with their problems and if comes to us, we'll

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:49.484
"keep it to the shore. The good news is, as far as
I know, Xhorhas isn't a naval-oriented people.

00:26:49.484 --> 00:26:56.267
"What I have heard," and he leans in a bit, "is the
underelves apparently snuck past the mountain

00:26:56.267 --> 00:27:05.084
"range and attacked further inland. Felderwin was
assaulted and the fields were set ablaze."

00:27:05.084 --> 00:27:06.587
LAURA: What, where was--?

00:27:06.587 --> 00:27:11.646
MATT: "A smart move in cutting the food from the
people, eh? These beasts are clever. Be careful."

00:27:11.646 --> 00:27:13.411
SAM: He said Felderwin.

00:27:13.411 --> 00:27:15.000
MATT: "Felderwin, yes."

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:23.553
TRAVIS: I'm sorry to hear that. Just in case our
travels take us in your direction, is there any

00:27:23.553 --> 00:27:28.986
particular route or island that we should avoid
just to stay out of your hair?

00:27:28.986 --> 00:27:34.902
MATT: "I don't think-- We are running along the
coast and just heading to the southern area south

00:27:34.902 --> 00:27:40.668
"of the jungles and a little bit past Nicodranas
and keeping a boundary in the waters."

00:27:40.668 --> 00:27:45.901
TRAVIS: That should be far away from where we're
heading. I wish you a safe journey, my friend.

00:27:45.901 --> 00:27:51.289
MATT: "You as well." He grabs his stuff and throws
it over his shoulder and heads back to the rest of

00:27:51.289 --> 00:27:53.028
the crew.

00:27:53.028 --> 00:27:57.043
MARISHA: Wait, the Xhorhasians snuck under the
mountains and attacked Felderwin?

00:27:57.043 --> 00:27:58.598
TRAVIS: That's where they attacked, yeah.

00:27:58.598 --> 00:27:59.717
LIAM: That's deep in.

00:27:59.717 --> 00:28:01.051
LAURA: That's really-- yeah.

00:28:01.051 --> 00:28:06.215
MATT: Apparently set some of the fields ablaze.
You passed by Felderwin when you were traveling

00:28:06.215 --> 00:28:14.403
both north and south on that road there and it's a
heavy source of agriculture. In fact, it feeds a

00:28:14.403 --> 00:28:15.983
lot of the military.

00:28:15.983 --> 00:28:20.075
TRAVIS: Yeah, we might return to a different
empire.

00:28:20.075 --> 00:28:20.769
LAURA: Fjord.

00:28:20.769 --> 00:28:21.599
TRAVIS: Yeah?

00:28:21.599 --> 00:28:25.922
LAURA: Ask them where they're from, all the
troops. Did you already ask that?

00:28:25.922 --> 00:28:28.691
TRAVIS: Yeah, they're from outside Nicodranas.

00:28:28.691 --> 00:28:30.701
LAURA: So they won't know who we are?

00:28:30.701 --> 00:28:34.602
TRAVIS: I think they have bigger fish to fry.
Plus, we got a new boat, right?

00:28:34.602 --> 00:28:42.907
MATT: At this point, you hear a (throat clearing).
You turn around and you see a human male in his

00:28:42.907 --> 00:28:48.668
mid-40s with salt and pepper brown hair with a
thick mustache, somewhat stained linen clothing

00:28:48.668 --> 00:28:56.016
with a length of rope wrapped over his shoulder,
and he goes, "Hello, I'm Dockmaster Podderan. I was

00:28:56.016 --> 00:29:02.046
"the one patiently waiting, I guess, for you all to
return and pay for the good repairs that were

00:29:02.046 --> 00:29:08.208
"required of my crew. So if you want to pay up, or
we're going to have to keep the Balleater ourselves."

00:29:08.208 --> 00:29:10.158
TRAVIS: No, indeed.

00:29:10.158 --> 00:29:12.418
MATT: "Curious name, Balleater, by the way."

00:29:12.418 --> 00:29:18.155
TRAVIS: Yeah, it is one born out of circumstance.
We have every intention of paying. I just haven't

00:29:18.155 --> 00:29:22.241
received the bill from my first mate yet.

00:29:22.241 --> 00:29:29.789
MARISHA: I frantically search for a bill that I
probably don't have.

00:29:29.789 --> 00:29:32.300
TRAVIS: You definitely don't.

00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:39.933
MARISHA: I look at the dockmaster; I go: Give me
the bill.

00:29:39.933 --> 00:29:45.065
MATT: Reaches into his satchel, pulls out a small
leather ledger, past a few pages. There's little

00:29:45.065 --> 00:29:51.407
counts, a couple notes there. Tears it out and
hands it to you. It's for 225 gold for full ship repairs.

00:29:51.407 --> 00:29:54.669
LAURA: That's more than they said when we came
out.

00:29:54.669 --> 00:30:00.298
TRAVIS: I'll take care of it. I'm the one touching
little red things. 295?

00:30:00.298 --> 00:30:02.779
MARISHA: You're taking care of all of it? Did we
have any--?

00:30:02.779 --> 00:30:03.680
MATT: 225.

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:04.969
TRAVIS: 325?

00:30:04.969 --> 00:30:15.315
MARISHA: His Grog is showing. Was there any money
left on the ship from Avantika?

00:30:15.315 --> 00:30:21.887
MATT: No. That pot was taken by Darktow when they
came aboard.

00:30:21.887 --> 00:30:25.279
TRAVIS: Yeah, when they came and cleaned it out
after the fucking razzle-dazzle.

00:30:25.279 --> 00:30:27.991
MARISHA: So all the money we have is pretty much
the money we have.

00:30:28.237 --> 00:30:32.462
MATT: Correct. That was the other downside with
Avantika being wrapped up in this whole plot in

00:30:32.462 --> 00:30:38.127
Darktow was, as soon as she was executed, they
commandeered anything that belonged to her crew

00:30:38.127 --> 00:30:43.661
and left you guys the ship. With the supplies on
the ship: you got to keep the cannons, the

00:30:43.661 --> 00:30:50.718
cannonballs, the gunpowder, basic supplies that
were left over for survival and upkeep, but

00:30:50.718 --> 00:30:56.045
anything of worth was taken by Darktow as their
prize.

00:30:56.045 --> 00:30:57.988
TALIESIN: We're going to need to wash some dishes,
aren't we?

00:30:57.988 --> 00:31:00.053
TRAVIS: I cut my gold in half, holy shit.

00:31:00.053 --> 00:31:00.866
MARISHA: Fjord.

00:31:00.866 --> 00:31:01.637
TRAVIS: Yeah?

00:31:01.637 --> 00:31:09.065
MARISHA: We might want to consider having a
communal ship fund. We'll talk about it later.

00:31:09.065 --> 00:31:16.271
TRAVIS: Here is your 225 gold. Thank you for your
careful inspection and repair of the ship.

00:31:16.271 --> 00:31:20.940
MATT: "Appreciate that. All right, well, when're
you planning to head off?"

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:25.176
TRAVIS: Oh, in the next day or two, we're just
getting our bearings about us again. We'll be out

00:31:25.176 --> 00:31:26.801
of your hair shortly.

00:31:26.801 --> 00:31:32.524
MATT: "Could you leave possibly by end of day?
I'll give you back 30 gold if that's the case. I

00:31:32.524 --> 00:31:36.436
"need to--," and he looks off towards the ships
that are waiting and goes, "I kind of need the space."

00:31:36.436 --> 00:31:42.428
TRAVIS: I would love to tell you yes, friend, but
the best I could do is let you know before sundown.

00:31:42.428 --> 00:31:45.372
LAURA: Maybe for 50 gold we could get out,
though.

00:31:45.372 --> 00:31:45.899
TRAVIS: No.

00:31:45.899 --> 00:31:48.348
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

00:31:48.348 --> 00:31:52.827
TRAVIS: We have stuff we have to do, don't rush us
out of here!

00:31:52.827 --> 00:31:57.535
LAURA: No, that's not very good. Eight!

00:31:57.535 --> 00:32:06.911
MATT: He goes, "Well, come find me," and he points
over to one of the nicer coastal huts set up right

00:32:06.911 --> 00:32:08.913
at the outside of the docks.

00:32:08.913 --> 00:32:12.910
TRAVIS: Ooh, nice. Yeah, we'll find you. I promise
we'll be as expedient as possible.

00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:18.439
MATT: "Right." Turns back and heads off to his
business. Various military crews are still running

00:32:18.439 --> 00:32:22.179
up and down the docks carrying supplies to and
from. What would you guys like to do?

00:32:22.179 --> 00:32:24.605
TRAVIS: Walk inland.

00:32:24.605 --> 00:32:28.866
MARISHA: Breakfast! Caduceus.

00:32:28.866 --> 00:32:31.289
TRAVIS: Yeah, and eyes up as we pass things along
the way.

00:32:31.289 --> 00:32:33.665
TALIESIN: I'm walking towards where I think
breakfast is.

00:32:33.665 --> 00:32:35.897
MATT: Okay. Make a perception check.

00:32:35.897 --> 00:32:38.684
MARISHA: Come on, you're a foodie.

00:32:38.684 --> 00:32:44.930
TALIESIN: Natural 20! I was really looking forward
to having no idea, but apparently--

00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:47.213
TRAVIS: We've got to make more of a fuss about
that, that's pretty cool.

00:32:47.213 --> 00:32:50.403
TALIESIN: Hold on, I got Yelp. I cast Yelp.

00:32:50.403 --> 00:32:58.529
MATT: The closest place-- the scent catches your
nose. There's a place called the Bisaft Meadery.

00:32:58.529 --> 00:33:00.350
LAURA: Meatery?

00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:01.644
MATT: Meadery.

00:33:01.644 --> 00:33:02.954
LAURA: Oh, Meadery.

00:33:02.954 --> 00:33:07.167
TALIESIN: Oh, that's better. I was like: Mm,
okay.

00:33:07.167 --> 00:33:16.950
MATT: No. It's a small, open-- It looks like a
simple tavern, but only the back half of it has

00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:22.807
walls where it's a thatched top. There are support
beams, and there are a number of tables and stools

00:33:22.807 --> 00:33:30.759
set up and a number of mead barrels set up in the
back as well as an open grill made of metal rods

00:33:30.759 --> 00:33:41.228
welded over each other and a bunch of wood burning
beneath it. Some of the people that live here in

00:33:41.228 --> 00:33:47.187
Bisaft that run this meadery are preparing an open
breakfast, essentially, and a lot of the soldiers

00:33:47.187 --> 00:33:57.488
are crowding over and filling up spaces. The scent
catches your nose of cooking boar and various

00:33:57.488 --> 00:34:02.883
fruits and vegetables that are also being mixed
in, giving you this sweet meat scent that hits you

00:34:02.883 --> 00:34:06.906
as you're stepping off the dock. The closer you
get, you realize you've got to get there pretty

00:34:06.906 --> 00:34:11.440
quickly because it's starting to fill up with a
lot of these soldiers. As you get to the food, it

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:17.910
smells delicious. It's made for a mass meal for
the number of people that are here, so this is

00:34:17.910 --> 00:34:23.248
their way of preparing as much as they can, so
it's nothing meticulous. It's nothing gourmet,

00:34:23.248 --> 00:34:25.886
necessarily, but it looks delicious and it looks
serviceable.

00:34:25.886 --> 00:34:28.638
TALIESIN: I can pick around the boar; that
shouldn't be a problem.

00:34:28.638 --> 00:34:30.322
LAURA: You don't eat boar?

00:34:30.322 --> 00:34:31.767
TALIESIN: I don't eat boar.

00:34:31.767 --> 00:34:32.733
LAURA: Do you eat meat?

00:34:32.733 --> 00:34:33.721
TALIESIN: I don't eat meat.

00:34:33.721 --> 00:34:34.276
LAURA: Really?

00:34:34.276 --> 00:34:36.325
TALIESIN: Have you not noticed?

00:34:36.325 --> 00:34:37.495
LAURA: I haven't!

00:34:37.495 --> 00:34:43.538
TALIESIN: Oh. Yeah, no. I mean, we've barely
cooked with any of it in the last month.

00:34:43.538 --> 00:34:46.427
SAM: But meat tastes very, very good!

00:34:46.427 --> 00:34:50.467
TRAVIS: Yeah, and so does the stuff that you make.
I just assumed you were conjuring, you know, sea

00:34:50.467 --> 00:34:51.854
pigeons and stuff.

00:34:51.854 --> 00:34:55.477
TALIESIN: It's mostly seitan. There's a few
different things I use. You can really get an

00:34:55.477 --> 00:34:56.303
effect, it's--

00:34:56.303 --> 00:34:57.928
TRAVIS: Seitan?

00:34:57.928 --> 00:35:00.051
LIAM: (Mickey Mouse voice) Hail, seitan!

00:35:00.051 --> 00:35:04.947
TALIESIN: Making me call my vegan cooking not
legit. My god, I'm mad right now.

00:35:04.947 --> 00:35:06.656
TRAVIS: Quinn-wah?

00:35:06.656 --> 00:35:17.196
TALIESIN: There's a lot of paprika. Pasta burgers.
A lot of beets. I'm excited for this.

00:35:17.196 --> 00:35:21.878
TRAVIS: Are we relatively free of furtive glances
as we make our way through?

00:35:21.878 --> 00:35:26.852
MATT: Yeah, due to the nature of this being a
small port and the military that are coming in

00:35:27.078 --> 00:35:30.901
through here. People live here from all over; you
can see a spectrum of skin tones that lead you to

00:35:30.901 --> 00:35:34.991
believe that there are people both who come from
the Ki'Nau, who are from the island, people that

00:35:34.991 --> 00:35:40.196
have settled from the Empire, folks that have come
from Marquet and come here and even probably is a

00:35:40.196 --> 00:35:46.773
few super pale folks here that may have found
their way over from Issylra. For the people that

00:35:46.773 --> 00:35:52.047
live here, it's a fairly diverse cultural capital,
though a lot of it seems to be mostly ingrained,

00:35:52.047 --> 00:35:59.860
at least the basis of it, in the Ki'Nau people and
the base of a lot of the Menagerie Coast.

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:02.464
TRAVIS: Jester, can I make you a plate?

00:36:02.464 --> 00:36:08.370
LAURA: No, I think I'm okay, Fjord, thank you.

00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:12.806
TRAVIS: Okay, cool. Should we bring Caleb some
food?

00:36:12.806 --> 00:36:17.329
SAM: Yes. Yes, we should. I can take him some in
my pockets.

00:36:17.329 --> 00:36:20.040
TALIESIN: Pocket boar.

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:23.947
MATT: Pocket bacon, pocket boar.

00:36:23.947 --> 00:36:26.356
TALIESIN: I'm going to try some mead.

00:36:26.356 --> 00:36:29.649
SAM: Some mead, not meat.

00:36:29.649 --> 00:36:32.278
TALIESIN: Not meat. But I am going to try some
mead.

00:36:32.278 --> 00:36:33.552
SAM: Okay.

00:36:33.552 --> 00:36:35.529
MARISHA: Yeah, how much is a bottle?

00:36:35.529 --> 00:36:40.569
MATT: Well, you go ahead and ask. There's maybe
four servers that are running around like crazy

00:36:40.569 --> 00:36:43.994
that are in the process of handing things out and
taking stuff, but there is one individual you see,

00:36:43.994 --> 00:36:52.033
this woman in her late 50s, early 60s. Beautiful
brown skin, big smile, a little heavyset, who

00:36:52.033 --> 00:36:59.644
seems to be looking over the place like she is the
owner of this meadery. Looks over to you and, as

00:36:59.644 --> 00:37:03.855
your eyes meet, notices the look of, "I need
help," and goes over and goes, "Hello, darling.

00:37:03.855 --> 00:37:05.750
"How can I help you?"

00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:09.074
MARISHA: I think he wanted to try some mead, I
wanted to try some mead, and then we wanted to buy

00:37:09.074 --> 00:37:10.073
some mead.

00:37:10.073 --> 00:37:12.975
MATT: "Well, I can help with any of these, of
course."

00:37:12.975 --> 00:37:13.923
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

00:37:13.923 --> 00:37:15.169
MATT: "What's your name?"

00:37:15.169 --> 00:37:15.829
MARISHA: Beau.

00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:20.543
MATT: "Beau. Well, a pleasure to meet you. I am
Bentha Tamalos, and welcome to my meadery."

00:37:20.543 --> 00:37:22.243
MARISHA: Benth-- can I call you Ben?

00:37:22.243 --> 00:37:24.448
MATT: "Call me Bentha, please."

00:37:24.448 --> 00:37:26.585
MARISHA: Bentha. Pleasure.

00:37:26.585 --> 00:37:32.945
MATT: "Pleasure to meet you as well, darling.
Well, how many bottles would you like? Do you want

00:37:32.945 --> 00:37:36.545
"to have glasses separately or do you want to just
buy bottles and serve yourselves?"

00:37:36.545 --> 00:37:42.626
TALIESIN: It smells really sweet. What's the
sweetest thing you've got right now?

00:37:42.626 --> 00:37:48.344
MATT: "Well, it's all pretty sweet. It's all
brewed here with our island-cultivated honeybees."

00:37:48.344 --> 00:37:50.507
TRAVIS: It's sweet, you'll like it.

00:37:50.507 --> 00:37:54.432
SAM: Let's just get a couple of bottles and
share.

00:37:54.432 --> 00:37:57.087
TALIESIN: Sure, I think that sounds like a great
idea.

00:37:57.087 --> 00:37:58.765
LAURA: You keep bees here?

00:37:58.765 --> 00:37:59.990
MATT: "I do as well, yes."

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:01.556
LAURA: Can I see them?

00:38:01.556 --> 00:38:09.229
MATT: "Mm... they're not immediately local. Would
you like a tour of our hives?"

00:38:09.229 --> 00:38:12.979
(laughter)

00:38:12.979 --> 00:38:14.801
TALIESIN: This is going to go so well.

00:38:14.801 --> 00:38:19.502
MATT: "I do have to ask, unfortunately, there is a
tourist price for the tour."

00:38:20.799 --> 00:38:21.938
LAURA: How much is that?

00:38:21.938 --> 00:38:24.187
MATT: "Five silver."

00:38:24.187 --> 00:38:25.200
LAURA: Okay.

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:30.812
MATT: "All right. The bottles are 15 gold a piece.
You wanted two bottles, that'll be 30 gold, and

00:38:30.812 --> 00:38:33.239
"you wanted how many cups? Or do you just want your
bottles?"

00:38:33.239 --> 00:38:41.188
SAM: Bunch of cups! Bunch of plates of gristle and
meat and boar and fat.

00:38:41.188 --> 00:38:45.033
TALIESIN: Do you have anything that's more-- less
meat?

00:38:45.033 --> 00:38:50.579
MATT: She looks up at you and goes, "Do not worry,
honey, I get you, no problem. All right. I'll

00:38:50.579 --> 00:38:54.003
"prepare this." She does some calculations and
goes, "All right, for all of that together with

00:38:54.003 --> 00:38:56.680
"your glasses for each of you, the meals prepared
for each--"

00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:58.945
SAM: Some tripe. Maybe some knuckles.

00:38:58.945 --> 00:39:01.622
LAURA: Some pastries, if you have them.

00:39:01.622 --> 00:39:07.480
MATT: "Unfortunately, not much of a pastry
opportunity out here on the Swavain."

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:10.184
LAURA: (mimicking Bentha's accent) No cookies, no
doughnuts?

00:39:10.184 --> 00:39:26.375
MATT: Her smile maintains, but the eyes go hard.
But she goes, "No doughnuts. However, for

00:39:26.375 --> 00:39:32.011
"everything involved, that would be 35 gold for all
glasses of mead, all food provided."

00:39:32.011 --> 00:39:34.074
MARISHA: Could you get it?

00:39:34.074 --> 00:39:35.412
TRAVIS: Don't look at me, I'm shit broke.

00:39:35.412 --> 00:39:37.242
TALIESIN: I'll throw a little in on this.

00:39:37.242 --> 00:39:38.435
MARISHA: I took 30 if you want to take the other
five.

00:39:38.435 --> 00:39:42.843
MATT: "And five silver for the tour for this blue
young woman over here."

00:39:45.193 --> 00:39:48.283
TALIESIN: That seems very fair.

00:39:48.283 --> 00:39:55.771
MATT: All right. The food is presented. It smells
wonderful. The din is quite loud now as the

00:39:56.021 --> 00:40:03.388
various naval officers and naval soldiers of the
Clovis Concord are surrounding the space and

00:40:03.388 --> 00:40:12.300
chatting, talking about bullshit. Some of it is in
Common, some of it is not. While you guys are

00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:18.644
eating your food, anything else you want to do?
The mead is quite good; it is very sweet. Even

00:40:18.644 --> 00:40:22.056
just finishing one glass, you're like, "Oh, this
is dangerous," and probably going to give you a

00:40:22.056 --> 00:40:26.035
headache if you're not careful. What?

00:40:26.035 --> 00:40:28.281
MARISHA: Nothing.

00:40:28.281 --> 00:40:30.030
TRAVIS: How many glasses did you have?

00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:31.895
MARISHA: Just one.

00:40:31.895 --> 00:40:33.291
TRAVIS: Ren faire, ah!

00:40:33.291 --> 00:40:35.716
MATT: Yeah, severe Ren faire flashbacks.

00:40:35.716 --> 00:40:38.872
LAURA: I don't want any mead; I just want the
honey.

00:40:38.872 --> 00:40:40.135
TRAVIS: Three o'clock.

00:40:40.135 --> 00:40:41.539
LAURA: Yeah!

00:40:41.539 --> 00:40:49.552
MATT: As you guys are in the process of eating
your food, a recently-awoken and somewhat

00:40:49.552 --> 00:40:53.906
harsh-looking morning Yasha wanders over.

00:40:53.906 --> 00:41:00.414
MARISHA: You found us again. This is the sixth
time. You just know where we are.

00:41:00.414 --> 00:41:01.616
LAURA: Well, she was on the boat with us.

00:41:01.616 --> 00:41:02.899
TRAVIS: She was on the boat, Beau.

00:41:02.899 --> 00:41:04.884
MARISHA: I know, but she was just-- we're in a
restaurant.

00:41:04.884 --> 00:41:06.935
ASHLEY: You guys just didn't wake me up for
breakfast?

00:41:06.935 --> 00:41:11.386
SAM: You were sleeping; you were snoring really
loud, and it sounded like you were angry snoring.

00:41:11.386 --> 00:41:18.548
ASHLEY: Well, yeah, I guess, I did tell you I'm
angry when I sleep. I don't like being woken up, I

00:41:18.548 --> 00:41:22.328
forgot, but it would've been nice to be woken up.

00:41:22.328 --> 00:41:23.584
SAM: I'm sorry.

00:41:23.584 --> 00:41:27.627
MARISHA: This is precisely why we didn't wake you
up.

00:41:27.627 --> 00:41:29.647
TRAVIS: But we did make you this plate of food.

00:41:29.647 --> 00:41:31.239
MARISHA: Right, yeah.

00:41:31.239 --> 00:41:33.953
ASHLEY: (gobbling)

00:41:33.953 --> 00:41:36.694
MARISHA: I pour her a very large glass of mead.

00:41:36.694 --> 00:41:43.436
TRAVIS: I'll go over and find Bentha and be like:
Can we get one more plate of food, please?

00:41:43.436 --> 00:41:47.168
MATT: Comes by and slips it over.

00:41:47.168 --> 00:41:52.510
TRAVIS: I'll hand that plate of food over to Nott:
There you go. No, it's not for you!

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:53.663
SAM: Oh.

00:41:54.763 --> 00:41:56.479
TALIESIN: Back out, back out.

00:41:57.224 --> 00:42:00.024
SAM: (food coming out of mouth noises)

00:42:00.024 --> 00:42:02.684
MARISHA: (laughter)

00:42:02.819 --> 00:42:06.736
MATT: As you guys are finishing your meal and
Yasha's quietly staring into the plate and eating

00:42:07.012 --> 00:42:11.030
with a distant intensity, like she's prone to--

00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:15.293
TRAVIS: We're fitting to explore a little.

00:42:15.293 --> 00:42:18.788
MARISHA: We were going to go on a winery tour.

00:42:18.788 --> 00:42:19.807
TRAVIS: That's not--

00:42:19.807 --> 00:42:24.486
SAM: No, that's not-- we were going to look for
incense and supplies.

00:42:24.486 --> 00:42:26.040
TALIESIN: Insects, supplies.

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:30.886
TRAVIS: Maybe some weapons or some potions that
might help should we find ourselves--

00:42:30.886 --> 00:42:36.205
SAM: We might also want to discuss what we're
doing next. I mean, we just had this crazy escape

00:42:36.385 --> 00:42:40.665
from Pirate Island and now-- what are we doing,
where are we going?

00:42:40.665 --> 00:42:43.047
LAURA: Do you want us to go to this temple?

00:42:43.047 --> 00:42:48.814
TRAVIS: I mean, I would like to, yeah. I saw it in
my visions and I haven't had any other dreams

00:42:48.814 --> 00:42:53.885
since. I feel like this might be a good chance to
put a dagger in it, you know? Finish it up.

00:42:53.885 --> 00:42:55.207
SAM: Do you know where?

00:42:55.207 --> 00:42:58.880
TRAVIS: Yeah, I have a feeling it's right in the
middle of the archipelago that's just south of

00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:02.397
here. Maybe a day and a half, maybe two days most,
depending on--

00:43:02.397 --> 00:43:04.203
SAM: So more traveling on the water?

00:43:04.203 --> 00:43:10.885
TRAVIS: Just a little bit and then we can go back
to land. Nott. With the promise of land and no

00:43:10.885 --> 00:43:15.935
more requests to go to sea, if you'll do this for
me I would be most obliged.

00:43:15.935 --> 00:43:19.727
MARISHA: Fjord, what was that naval officer--?

00:43:19.727 --> 00:43:21.226
SAM: I will go.

00:43:21.226 --> 00:43:23.061
TRAVIS: Thank you, Nott.

00:43:23.061 --> 00:43:24.523
MARISHA: Sorry. What was--?

00:43:24.523 --> 00:43:26.085
SAM: He's being very nice today.

00:43:26.085 --> 00:43:28.078
LAURA: Yes, I think he feels guilty.

00:43:28.078 --> 00:43:34.463
SAM: I know he feels guilty. He asked you to
accompany him off the boat, he offered to make a

00:43:34.463 --> 00:43:36.658
plate of food for you, he's being nice to me.

00:43:36.658 --> 00:43:37.767
LAURA: I know.

00:43:37.767 --> 00:43:39.773
SAM: (gasp) Is he hitting on you?

00:43:39.773 --> 00:43:40.488
LAURA: No.

00:43:40.488 --> 00:43:41.868
SAM: I think he's hitting on you.

00:43:41.868 --> 00:43:42.788
LAURA: No, he's not.

00:43:42.788 --> 00:43:44.091
SAM: Are you sure?

00:43:44.091 --> 00:43:44.975
LAURA: Yeah.

00:43:44.975 --> 00:43:53.622
MARISHA: What did that naval officer say to you
about the war? What was I hearing?

00:43:53.906 --> 00:43:59.340
TRAVIS: He was saying they've made their way south
into the fucking town of... Nipple Bottom--

00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:00.260
SAM: Felderwin.

00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:02.055
TRAVIS: Felderwin, yeah.

00:44:02.055 --> 00:44:04.038
SAM: It's where some of us are from.

00:44:04.038 --> 00:44:05.207
TRAVIS: Yeah, we've been right near that area.

00:44:05.207 --> 00:44:06.646
LAURA: You're from Felderwin?

00:44:06.646 --> 00:44:07.207
TRAVIS: Oh.

00:44:07.207 --> 00:44:09.305
LAURA: You're from Felderwin?

00:44:09.305 --> 00:44:10.711
SAM: Around there, yeah.

00:44:10.711 --> 00:44:13.483
TRAVIS: It's far more south than they've been
previously.

00:44:13.483 --> 00:44:16.054
MARISHA: Does that freak anybody else out?

00:44:16.054 --> 00:44:19.035
SAM and MARISHA: Me.

00:44:19.035 --> 00:44:20.862
LAURA: What about your... you know?

00:44:20.862 --> 00:44:23.059
SAM: I don't know.

00:44:23.059 --> 00:44:26.586
MARISHA: It's not far from my hometown either.

00:44:26.586 --> 00:44:34.597
TRAVIS: Really? That maybe changes things.

00:44:34.597 --> 00:44:36.163
MARISHA: From Kamordah.

00:44:36.708 --> 00:44:39.738
(rustling noises)

00:44:39.738 --> 00:44:42.109
SAM: Go to the map.

00:44:42.109 --> 00:44:46.432
TRAVIS: Point. Oh. That is pretty far west.

00:44:46.432 --> 00:44:52.121
MARISHA: Yeah, but he said that they were
traveling under the mountains, and Kamordah is a

00:44:52.121 --> 00:44:54.496
mountain town, so...

00:44:54.496 --> 00:44:56.748
ASHLEY: Who's traveling under the mountains?

00:44:56.748 --> 00:44:57.980
LAURA: The Xhorhasians.

00:44:57.980 --> 00:44:59.572
SAM: Your people.

00:44:59.572 --> 00:45:02.368
MARISHA: They got under the mountains and attacked
Felderwin.

00:45:03.658 --> 00:45:04.604
ASHLEY: Huh.

00:45:04.604 --> 00:45:10.399
LAURA: That's what all these soldiers are here
for; they're going to join the fight or something?

00:45:10.399 --> 00:45:11.803
What did they say, Fjord?

00:45:11.803 --> 00:45:12.976
SAM: Reinforcements?

00:45:12.976 --> 00:45:15.233
TRAVIS: They were going down the southern coast,
yeah.

00:45:15.233 --> 00:45:16.672
ASHLEY: Oh.

00:45:16.672 --> 00:45:20.042
TRAVIS: Most likely in an effort not to get
flanked.

00:45:20.042 --> 00:45:22.809
ASHLEY: Yeah, okay.

00:45:24.729 --> 00:45:28.110
MARISHA: I think we should still go to the temple,
though.

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:36.601
TRAVIS: Well, I don't feel quite as energetic,
knowing that where you both are from is under siege.

00:45:37.382 --> 00:45:41.312
MARISHA: Well, I'm just being paranoid.

00:45:41.312 --> 00:45:44.722
SAM: I'm always paranoid.

00:45:44.722 --> 00:45:52.133
LAURA: What if we went to the temple and then
headed back? No dilly-dallying, we just go and

00:45:52.133 --> 00:45:54.132
make sure that everything's okay.

00:45:54.132 --> 00:46:00.842
TRAVIS: It may only add a day or two at most. I
would be most appreciative.

00:46:00.842 --> 00:46:07.760
TALIESIN: No sense reading two-thirds of a book.
Let's finish this up, see what it has to say.

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:11.864
LAURA: Are you going to try to-- what are you
going to do to Uk'otoa?

00:46:11.864 --> 00:46:14.342
LAURA and TALIESIN: (whispering) Uk'otoa.

00:46:14.342 --> 00:46:15.995
SAM: Did you self-echo?

00:46:15.995 --> 00:46:17.092
LAURA: Yeah, I did.

00:46:17.092 --> 00:46:20.793
(laughter)

00:46:20.793 --> 00:46:29.246
TRAVIS: I don't know. I just thought I'd feel it
out when I got there, all current and past events

00:46:29.246 --> 00:46:31.111
taken into account.

00:46:31.111 --> 00:46:36.706
SAM: Feel out whether you would raise Uk'otoa from
the dark and join its dark ways?

00:46:36.706 --> 00:46:44.398
TRAVIS: No, no, god, no--! No. I do have two of
these spheres, and I can't help but notice the

00:46:44.398 --> 00:46:51.502
extra shamalamadingdong that Avantika got by
depositing one of them. I could keep the third and

00:46:51.502 --> 00:46:59.274
certainly keep that crazy fucking snake at bay. I
would like to see this through. Otherwise, I feel

00:46:59.274 --> 00:47:01.967
like I'll always be wanting to get back here.

00:47:01.967 --> 00:47:04.807
LAURA: Plus, we still haven't found out about
Vandran.

00:47:04.807 --> 00:47:16.119
TRAVIS: Right, but he could be fucking anywhere. I
want to do this because we're here. We can worry

00:47:16.119 --> 00:47:18.502
about that later; it's a wide, wide world.

00:47:18.502 --> 00:47:21.749
SAM: Okay.

00:47:21.749 --> 00:47:31.934
MARISHA: So we find the temple, and then what? I
guess, go back to Nicodranas first, yeah?

00:47:31.934 --> 00:47:37.763
TRAVIS: We might have to go through Port Damali,
actually. Nicodranas is a little hot for us. But

00:47:37.763 --> 00:47:40.893
we could. We could let your mom know that you're
okay.

00:47:40.893 --> 00:47:45.898
LAURA: I mean, I can message her. I've been
messaging her.

00:47:45.898 --> 00:47:49.832
TRAVIS: Well, maybe see how you feel when we're on
our way back. We wouldn't want to go around the

00:47:49.832 --> 00:47:53.561
southern tip; that's where the troops are heading.
I feel like danger might be that way. It might be

00:47:53.561 --> 00:47:56.491
best to go the way we came.

00:47:56.491 --> 00:47:57.721
LAURA: Okay.

00:47:57.721 --> 00:47:59.153
SAM: All right.

00:47:59.153 --> 00:48:02.875
TRAVIS: So maybe some supplies? Something to buff
us up a bit?

00:48:02.875 --> 00:48:04.330
LAURA: Some bees.

00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:06.698
TRAVIS: Some bees, yep.

00:48:06.698 --> 00:48:09.539
TALIESIN: I think some bees would suit you.

00:48:09.539 --> 00:48:11.555
LAURA: I just really want to see them.

00:48:11.555 --> 00:48:13.785
TALIESIN: You can talk to them.

00:48:13.785 --> 00:48:15.691
LAURA: I really want to talk to them.

00:48:15.691 --> 00:48:17.074
TALIESIN: I've talked to many bees in my time.

00:48:17.074 --> 00:48:17.632
LAURA: Really?

00:48:17.632 --> 00:48:18.300
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:20.010
LAURA: You can teach me the language?

00:48:20.010 --> 00:48:24.396
TALIESIN: I mean, you just: Hey, bees. How're you
doing?

00:48:24.396 --> 00:48:25.638
SAM: 'Sup, bee?

00:48:25.638 --> 00:48:28.606
LAURA: Hi, bees. Okay, okay.

00:48:28.606 --> 00:48:30.099
TALIESIN and LAURA: Bzz.

00:48:30.099 --> 00:48:30.995
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:48:30.995 --> 00:48:36.243
TRAVIS: Yasha, is there anything you need while
we're in port? Anything you've been craving while

00:48:36.243 --> 00:48:37.978
we've been at sea?

00:48:37.978 --> 00:48:51.161
ASHLEY: No. No, I just-- You guys were gone for a
really long time.

00:48:51.161 --> 00:48:53.950
LAURA: We didn't mean to be, Yasha.

00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:57.304
ASHLEY: You were gone for six days.

00:48:57.304 --> 00:49:03.979
TRAVIS: We didn't have any idea that that was
going to happen.

00:49:03.979 --> 00:49:06.753
MARISHA: Yeah, we-- Yeah.

00:49:06.753 --> 00:49:14.832
ASHLEY: I looked for you guys everywhere in that
room. I was just worried, is all.

00:49:14.832 --> 00:49:18.605
MARISHA: I'd be mad at us, too.

00:49:18.605 --> 00:49:29.512
ASHLEY: I don't need anything from here. I have
everything that I need, so if we need to go, we

00:49:29.512 --> 00:49:30.618
can go.

00:49:30.618 --> 00:49:34.812
TALIESIN: Thank you for looking everywhere in that
room. That's really nice.

00:49:34.812 --> 00:49:39.546
ASHLEY: Well, I just turned around, and then you
all were gone.

00:49:39.546 --> 00:49:42.558
TALIESIN: Yeah, it was crazy in there.

00:49:42.558 --> 00:49:44.502
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:49:44.502 --> 00:49:54.447
SAM: Did you have funerals for all of us? Must
have taken a lot of time. Like one a day.

00:49:54.447 --> 00:49:59.783
TALIESIN: I mean, that actually would have covered
everybody, the more you think about it.

00:49:59.783 --> 00:50:10.429
SAM: Was mine nice? Did anyone come? I guess not;
you were on the ocean. Did you say anything?

00:50:10.429 --> 00:50:15.951
ASHLEY: I did say some things that I probably
should not share with you, Nott.

00:50:15.951 --> 00:50:19.737
SAM: Like, they're bad words or something?

00:50:19.737 --> 00:50:22.181
ASHLEY: Something like that.

00:50:22.181 --> 00:50:24.150
SAM: You cursed at my funeral?!

00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:26.648
ASHLEY: I didn't have a funeral for you.

00:50:26.648 --> 00:50:29.730
SAM: I didn't even get a funeral?! Everybody else
did!

00:50:29.730 --> 00:50:31.959
ASHLEY: I didn't know if you were actually gone!

00:50:31.959 --> 00:50:34.130
SAM: Everyone got a funeral but me!

00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:35.827
ASHLEY: No! None of you did.

00:50:35.827 --> 00:50:38.787
SAM: Oh my god! You didn't give any of us
funerals?!

00:50:38.787 --> 00:50:44.967
ASHLEY: Because I didn't know if you were alive or
not! I was still holding onto maybe that you were

00:50:44.967 --> 00:50:48.472
and you just disappeared and you just didn't want
to stay with me anymore! You didn't want me part

00:50:48.472 --> 00:50:49.283
of the group!

00:50:49.283 --> 00:50:51.504
LAURA: Yasha, we want you to be part of the
group.

00:50:51.504 --> 00:50:52.506
MARISHA: Oh, Yasha.

00:50:52.506 --> 00:50:57.636
ASHLEY: No, I don't mean it like that. I'm not
saying, you know, "Woe, poor me," or something, but--

00:50:57.636 --> 00:51:03.890
TALIESIN: Wait, was "alive or not" a joke? I
always get confused when people use the word "not"

00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:05.932
in a sentence. Was that supposed to be a--?

00:51:05.932 --> 00:51:15.079
SAM: It's confusing. Okay. Group rule: if any of
us are missing for four or more days, we hold a

00:51:15.079 --> 00:51:19.401
funeral. Right? It's four days.

00:51:19.401 --> 00:51:25.127
TRAVIS: Well, let's make it an even seven, like a
week, right? Because that sphere's pretty fucking

00:51:25.127 --> 00:51:30.198
sweet. Not that I have any interest in messing
with it any further.

00:51:30.198 --> 00:51:31.236
SAM: Hells no.

00:51:31.236 --> 00:51:34.566
LAURA: If that dragon is dead, there's a lot of
stuff.

00:51:34.566 --> 00:51:39.214
TALIESIN: Though every time we did a little thing,
a little of that loot comes out.

00:51:39.214 --> 00:51:43.983
TRAVIS: Well, yeah, just a little. There were
fucking treasure troves in there. Not that I'm

00:51:43.983 --> 00:51:55.238
interested in that. I'm all for playing it safe.
Measured. Practical. That's my middle name. Fjord Practical--

00:51:55.238 --> 00:51:56.922
SAM: What's your last name?

00:51:56.922 --> 00:52:01.368
(laughter)

00:52:01.368 --> 00:52:02.928
TRAVIS: Fjord Practical.

00:52:02.928 --> 00:52:04.508
LAURA: Fjord Practical?

00:52:04.508 --> 00:52:07.851
MARISHA: It's the next sedan coming out.

00:52:07.851 --> 00:52:11.016
TRAVIS: Are there any potion shops around here?

00:52:11.410 --> 00:52:13.883
LIAM: Test drive a Ford Practical today.

00:52:13.883 --> 00:52:20.007
ASHLEY: What else have you found in there? Is
there anything else? Did you already look at everything?

00:52:20.007 --> 00:52:21.939
LAURA: Caleb got some books.

00:52:21.939 --> 00:52:23.805
TALIESIN: Caleb is actually not over here.

00:52:23.805 --> 00:52:25.421
SAM: Caleb's back at the boat.

00:52:25.421 --> 00:52:28.271
MARISHA: He decided to take some personal time to
himself.

00:52:28.271 --> 00:52:29.680
LAURA: To look at some books.

00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:32.760
TALIESIN: Everyone was a little thrown by what
happened.

00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:36.848
LAURA: We almost died, Yasha. And then we really
would have been dead and then we wouldn't have

00:52:36.848 --> 00:52:37.516
come back.

00:52:37.516 --> 00:52:38.410
ASHLEY: I never would have known.

00:52:38.410 --> 00:52:39.031
LAURA: No.

00:52:39.031 --> 00:52:40.827
ASHLEY: You fought something?

00:52:40.827 --> 00:52:44.644
LAURA: There was a big blue dragon.

00:52:44.644 --> 00:52:45.912
ASHLEY: Eh.

00:52:45.912 --> 00:52:51.342
TRAVIS: No bigs? No sweat?

00:52:51.342 --> 00:52:53.196
MARISHA: Oh, a Tuesday?

00:52:53.196 --> 00:52:56.894
TRAVIS: Are you going to show us the notches on
your upper delt for all the ones that you--

00:52:56.894 --> 00:52:59.786
ASHLEY: Well, I can, but I ran out of notches on
my belt.

00:52:59.786 --> 00:53:05.751
(cheering)

00:53:05.751 --> 00:53:06.764
TRAVIS: Fire!

00:53:06.764 --> 00:53:15.852
MARISHA: She holds up a handful of shreds. Just
fucked up.

00:53:15.852 --> 00:53:20.175
LIAM: All those teenagers in hoodies are going
like--

00:53:20.175 --> 00:53:23.695
TRAVIS: It was pretty gnarly.

00:53:23.695 --> 00:53:28.665
ASHLEY: Well, I'm glad you guys are safe, for
whatever the fuck it's worth.

00:53:28.665 --> 00:53:35.276
TALIESIN: It's worth a lot, and probably we'll be
a little more careful about poking things separately.

00:53:35.276 --> 00:53:39.071
TRAVIS: I was testing the texture. It wasn't even
a push; I just touched it.

00:53:39.071 --> 00:53:44.475
TALIESIN: No, it's the buddy system. No blame
going around.

00:53:44.475 --> 00:53:51.871
TRAVIS: Before we go on the bee tour, if there's
any time, do we see any magic shops? Weaponry?

00:53:51.871 --> 00:53:53.546
MATT: Make an investigation check.

00:53:53.546 --> 00:53:55.321
TALIESIN: We're doing the bee tour.

00:53:55.321 --> 00:53:57.371
LAURA: I want to see some bees.

00:53:57.371 --> 00:53:59.383
SAM: I'm looking for incense stores.

00:53:59.383 --> 00:54:00.129
TRAVIS: 16.

00:54:00.129 --> 00:54:01.477
SAM: 16.

00:54:01.477 --> 00:54:12.493
MATT: Okay. Magic shops, just so you guys are
aware, are super rare. There's one in Zadash, and

00:54:12.493 --> 00:54:14.375
there's maybe one or two in Rexxentrum.

00:54:14.375 --> 00:54:16.041
TRAVIS: So there's definitely one here.

00:54:16.041 --> 00:54:17.954
MATT: There's definitely not one here.

00:54:17.954 --> 00:54:22.791
TRAVIS: Three. Competing for the same turf.

00:54:22.791 --> 00:54:30.852
MATT: They're a relatively rare thing. But
herbalists are not too hard to find, and healing

00:54:30.852 --> 00:54:37.367
potions, while they can heal, the crafting of one
doesn't require massive arcane knowledge. It's

00:54:37.367 --> 00:54:43.714
through knowledge of medicines and proper brewing
techniques. However, the army has bought up a lot.

00:54:43.714 --> 00:54:52.173
There are two regular healing potions you can find
for sale for-- marked up because you're at sea--

00:54:52.173 --> 00:54:53.443
70 gold apiece.

00:54:53.443 --> 00:54:54.769
TRAVIS: Oh, fuck!

00:54:54.769 --> 00:54:56.189
SAM: Island prices.

00:54:56.189 --> 00:54:57.804
LIAM: Where else are you going to go?

00:54:57.804 --> 00:54:59.424
MATT: You can try and haggle, if you want to.

00:54:59.424 --> 00:55:01.881
LAURA: You've got two clerics. You don't need it.

00:55:01.881 --> 00:55:05.712
TRAVIS: I put a lot of healing potions into my
group.

00:55:05.712 --> 00:55:09.942
MARISHA: I'm getting poor, you guys. I'm getting
D&amp;D poor.

00:55:09.942 --> 00:55:12.044
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and find a blacksmith.

00:55:12.044 --> 00:55:13.919
SAM: Really? I've got lots of money.

00:55:13.919 --> 00:55:16.132
TRAVIS: Why don't you buy us a couple potions?

00:55:16.132 --> 00:55:19.157
SAM: Yeah. I'll buy both healing potions.

00:55:19.157 --> 00:55:21.709
TALIESIN: There may not be much time for such
things, but I was--

00:55:21.709 --> 00:55:26.365
MATT: Depends on what you're looking for. There is
a blacksmith by the name of Keisha Budan who does

00:55:26.365 --> 00:55:32.857
most of the metalwork for the ship repairs and
other general goods that require metalwork around

00:55:32.857 --> 00:55:35.172
the island.

00:55:35.172 --> 00:55:35.982
TALIESIN: Keisha?

00:55:35.982 --> 00:55:41.651
MATT: As you approach the space she has-- you can
tell from the large smokestack pouring out of the

00:55:41.867 --> 00:55:46.659
top of the forge that she keeps-- but as you
approach, you can see a young woman in her late

00:55:46.659 --> 00:55:55.317
20s or so, massive arms, her thick black hair
pulled back into a tuft, and she has a leather

00:55:55.317 --> 00:56:02.495
apron on. You can see now a lot of metal
reinforcements used for holding beams together in

00:56:02.495 --> 00:56:08.456
shipbuilding, and she's laying them out one by one
as she finishes hammering and then quenching and

00:56:08.456 --> 00:56:12.786
then hammering and quenching. As you walk up, she
rubs her brow. "Can I help you?"

00:56:12.786 --> 00:56:19.996
TALIESIN: Possibly not. Seems like you have your
hands full right now. I was hoping to, at the very

00:56:19.996 --> 00:56:23.647
least, get a professional opinion about
something.

00:56:23.647 --> 00:56:28.216
MATT: "I can do my best. I don't get many like
your height in here, anyway."

00:56:28.216 --> 00:56:29.760
TALIESIN: That's what they tell me.

00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:33.427
MATT: "At the very least, I'm looking forward to
sating my curiosity."

00:56:33.427 --> 00:56:41.956
TALIESIN: Well, I've recently taken to travelling,
which, very new experience for someone of my

00:56:41.956 --> 00:56:46.360
disposition, and I came across something
interesting and I was curious if you had an

00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:54.257
opinion on what this is and how one might fix it.
I pull out a broken sword.

00:56:54.557 --> 00:56:56.473
MATT: She takes it.

00:56:56.797 --> 00:57:00.582
TALIESIN: I was really hoping to be doing
something with this at some point, and giving it

00:57:00.582 --> 00:57:04.102
as a gift to a friend who could use a pick-me-up.

00:57:04.102 --> 00:57:15.236
MATT: "This is very good craftsmanship. I could
not do this. Unfortunately, the break is very bad.

00:57:15.236 --> 00:57:18.201
"Do you have the other part of the weapon?"

00:57:18.201 --> 00:57:22.474
TALIESIN: Sadly, I don't. It may not exist.

00:57:22.474 --> 00:57:29.637
MATT: "If given maybe a week with the right
materials, I could maybe try to work on it, but

00:57:29.637 --> 00:57:35.957
"honestly, your best bet is probably to go into the
coast. We don't do much in the way of masterwork

00:57:35.957 --> 00:57:38.846
"weapon craftsmanship here on Bisaft. My
apologies."

00:57:38.846 --> 00:57:43.514
TALIESIN: Oh, that's all right. They're definitely
trying hard to get us to leave a little sooner

00:57:43.514 --> 00:57:45.016
than we'd necessarily like to.

00:57:45.016 --> 00:57:47.023
MATT: "It has been very busy this past day or
two."

00:57:47.023 --> 00:57:51.526
TALIESIN: Has everything been all right, by the
way? This seems like a lot of commotion.

00:57:51.526 --> 00:57:55.430
MATT: "It's a lot of commotion, but they'll be
gone soon. We get waves of people coming through."

00:57:55.430 --> 00:58:02.620
TALIESIN: Well, thank you so much for your time. I
don't know what I could possibly do in return

00:58:02.620 --> 00:58:04.487
other than offer my gratitude.

00:58:04.487 --> 00:58:08.196
MATT: She sits up for a second and looks you over.
"Can I have a hug?"

00:58:08.196 --> 00:58:12.216
(laughter)

00:58:12.216 --> 00:58:14.266
TALIESIN: Yeah. I go in.

00:58:14.266 --> 00:58:16.465
MATT: She goes and takes it and cuddles you.

00:58:16.465 --> 00:58:18.086
TALIESIN: You want the spine lift?

00:58:18.086 --> 00:58:18.856
MATT: "Yeah."

00:58:18.856 --> 00:58:20.406
TALIESIN: All right.

00:58:20.406 --> 00:58:26.417
MATT: "Thank you. You're quite fuzzy, and I was
curious."

00:58:26.417 --> 00:58:30.596
TALIESIN: Oh, thank you, it was a pleasure. I look
forward to coming your way again one of these days.

00:58:30.596 --> 00:58:33.155
MATT: "Any time. We're here on the island. Nowhere
else to go."

00:58:33.155 --> 00:58:34.968
TALIESIN: This is awfully nice.

00:58:34.968 --> 00:58:39.365
MATT: "There are worse places to live, I'll tell
you that. Have a good day. What's your name?"

00:58:39.365 --> 00:58:40.606
TALIESIN: Caduceus.

00:58:40.606 --> 00:58:42.305
MATT: "Caduceus. Keisha."

00:58:42.305 --> 00:58:43.868
TALIESIN: Keisha. It's a pleasure.

00:58:43.868 --> 00:58:45.887
MATT: "The pleasure was all mine."

00:58:45.887 --> 00:58:47.657
TALIESIN: I will wander back to the bees.

00:58:47.657 --> 00:58:51.726
MATT: You walk away to the sound of (clanging) in
the background as she goes back to work.

00:58:51.726 --> 00:58:55.287
SAM: Did I find any incense?

00:58:55.287 --> 00:59:05.120
MATT: Because spice trade and various-- spices,
not spice-- trade here is quite prominent as

00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:15.057
well as other such materials in that same avenue,
various herbs and compounds used in alchemical and

00:59:15.057 --> 00:59:19.555
medicinal purposes, yeah, you can find incense
here, actually. It's marked up a little bit.

00:59:19.555 --> 00:59:24.395
Because it's Bisaft and because it's a trade post
out in the middle of the ocean, the people can

00:59:24.395 --> 00:59:29.115
charge a little more and they know they can.
Depending on how much incense you want to get?

00:59:29.115 --> 00:59:35.548
SAM: He did not give me an amount, so what's a
normal amount of incense that you would need for a

00:59:35.548 --> 00:59:37.517
month of incense burning?

00:59:37.517 --> 00:59:40.725
MATT: For a person burning incense in their
house?

00:59:40.725 --> 00:59:45.318
SAM: Yeah. Like a hippie person.

00:59:45.318 --> 00:59:51.030
MATT: We'll say about 20 gold worth, which would
cost you 25 here.

00:59:51.030 --> 00:59:54.568
SAM: Okay. I'll take 50 gold worth.

00:59:54.568 --> 01:00:00.456
MATT: Okay. So you take 50 gold worth, but it'll
cost you 60, we'll say. You mark off 60 gold, but

01:00:00.456 --> 01:00:02.827
you write down you have 50 gold worth of incense.

01:00:02.827 --> 01:00:08.984
SAM: Great. Cool. Okay.

01:00:08.984 --> 01:00:11.547
MATT: All right. The bee tour.

01:00:11.547 --> 01:00:13.026
LAURA: Hello, bees.

01:00:13.026 --> 01:00:22.377
MATT: She takes you around behind the meadery.
There's a jungle path that leads through the very

01:00:22.377 --> 01:00:31.267
lush, green trees, and it's a very humid day. The
morning was a little gray in the sky and it looks

01:00:31.267 --> 01:00:37.217
like it might rain in the next few hours or so.
She leads you through and is talking about how

01:00:37.217 --> 01:00:45.596
many years her family has been running the meadery
and it's a wonderful place. There isn't much of an

01:00:45.596 --> 01:00:50.277
interest in mead out here in the island so she
feels like she cornered the market a bit. She has

01:00:50.277 --> 01:00:54.661
friends that bring it to the other island towns
and it makes a fair amount of money. She's very

01:00:54.913 --> 01:01:01.536
proud of it. As she's doing the talk, she leads
you around. There are a small sect of wooden hive

01:01:01.536 --> 01:01:11.145
setups. You can hear already as you approach the
slight hum of them. There's a young boy, maybe 12

01:01:11.145 --> 01:01:18.744
or so, who is wearing a very thick smock with a
hood, who is in the process of scooping out some

01:01:18.744 --> 01:01:19.945
of the honey.

01:01:19.945 --> 01:01:22.444
LAURA: Whoa! Do I need to wear a thingy?

01:01:22.444 --> 01:01:28.603
MATT: "Oh, well, stay here, preferably. Do not get
close enough to let them sting you and if one's on

01:01:28.603 --> 01:01:30.612
"you, don't freak out and smack it, please."

01:01:30.612 --> 01:01:32.823
LAURA: Okay, but I really want to go up to them.

01:01:32.823 --> 01:01:36.630
MATT: "The tour is not intended to bring you that
close."

01:01:36.630 --> 01:01:44.669
LAURA: Hello, bees? Hello, bees. Please come over
here and let me say hello.

01:01:44.669 --> 01:01:48.853
MATT: She looks very confused and goes, "Okay?"

01:01:49.783 --> 01:01:52.563
TRAVIS: (laughter)

01:01:52.853 --> 01:01:56.969
LAURA: I start walking very slowly. Hello, bees. I
want some honey!

01:01:57.950 --> 01:02:01.022
MATT: Do you say that?

01:02:01.022 --> 01:02:02.012
LAURA: Yeah.

01:02:02.012 --> 01:02:04.250
MATT: She goes, "Well, if you want honey, I can
get you honey."

01:02:04.250 --> 01:02:07.091
LAURA: Yeah, but I want the honeycomb straight
from the thingy!

01:02:07.091 --> 01:02:09.492
MATT: "Ah."

01:02:09.492 --> 01:02:11.340
LIAM: Roll for Nic Cage.

01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:22.597
MATT: "Misan!" The little boy goes, "What?" "Bring
some honeycomb over here for a customer!" "Okay!"

01:02:22.597 --> 01:02:29.202
He cuts a little piece off with a dull knife and
holds it on the edge of the knife and walks over.

01:02:29.202 --> 01:02:32.421
You see the bees covered up his arm and he puts it
over and hands it to you.

01:02:32.421 --> 01:02:33.732
LAURA: Wow!

01:02:33.732 --> 01:02:39.183
MATT: It's gooey. It's very sweet and very waxy.

01:02:39.183 --> 01:02:47.053
LAURA: It's really good. It's like gum, but sweet.
Can I have a jar of it?

01:02:47.053 --> 01:02:53.100
MATT: The boy heads back to his work and she's
waving some of the bees away and goes, "Sure.

01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:57.611
"Let's walk back. I'll be happy to sell you a jar
or two. How many would you like?"

01:02:57.611 --> 01:02:59.163
LAURA: With the actual honeycomb in it?

01:02:59.163 --> 01:03:00.626
MATT: "Of course!"

01:03:00.626 --> 01:03:02.856
LAURA: I want two jars.

01:03:02.856 --> 01:03:05.284
MATT: "Two jars. That'll run you five gold
pieces."

01:03:05.284 --> 01:03:05.922
LAURA: Okay.

01:03:05.922 --> 01:03:11.255
MATT: "All right." She claps her hands together
happily and leads you back, telling you more about

01:03:11.255 --> 01:03:17.397
the waves of various traders and merchants that
come through. Some individuals, some names, she

01:03:17.397 --> 01:03:21.524
throws out that she's met and flirted with and one
that asked her to marry him when she was younger

01:03:21.524 --> 01:03:26.418
but she turned him down. You have no idea who any
of these people are, but you can't help but be

01:03:26.418 --> 01:03:33.238
half-fascinated, because they're stories. You have
two jars of honey plus honeycomb for five gold.

01:03:33.238 --> 01:03:40.001
ASHLEY and LAURA: Hello, bees!

01:03:40.001 --> 01:03:44.547
TALIESIN: I think I come wandering in about the
point where they're saying "Hello, bees," because

01:03:44.547 --> 01:03:47.001
this is really all I want.

01:03:47.001 --> 01:03:48.698
ASHLEY: You can talk to them?

01:03:48.698 --> 01:03:50.600
LAURA: Yeah! Say something!

01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:54.483
TALIESIN: What do you want me to say to them? I
don't know.

01:03:54.483 --> 01:03:57.128
LAURA: Tell them to come over here, but don't
sting us.

01:03:57.128 --> 01:03:59.364
TALIESIN: Hold on, hold on. Let me do a thing.

01:03:59.364 --> 01:04:05.443
MATT: You're approaching right as they're about to
leave from the hives.

01:04:05.443 --> 01:04:10.190
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a little bit of the
tea out of my pocket. I'm going to try and get a

01:04:10.190 --> 01:04:16.685
bloom going on my staff to try and get a flower to
start going on. If I can get something to start

01:04:16.685 --> 01:04:21.483
going a little bit. It may not be temporary, using
the Decompose. I don't know if you'll let me do that.

01:04:21.483 --> 01:04:27.720
MATT: A fungal bloom you can do with Decompose.
Druidcraft would be the creation of flowers, unfortunately.

01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:31.113
LAURA: Maybe they like mushrooms.

01:04:31.113 --> 01:04:38.774
TALIESIN: Well, I can ask. Hey, guys. I don't have
any flowers, but I have some mushrooms. I don't

01:04:38.774 --> 01:04:43.440
know if you'd be interested, but you're welcome to
come over and take a look. It's probably going to

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:46.737
rain pretty soon. It's looking a little iffy.

01:04:46.737 --> 01:04:52.043
MATT: (buzzing) They're doing their business.
They're not paying any attention to you.

01:04:52.043 --> 01:04:53.496
TALIESIN: They're working really hard right now.

01:04:53.496 --> 01:04:54.793
LAURA: Yeah, they look like it.

01:04:54.793 --> 01:04:56.803
ASHLEY: I've never seen bees before.

01:04:56.803 --> 01:04:58.197
TALIESIN: You've never seen bees before?

01:04:58.197 --> 01:04:59.738
MARISHA: Do you not have bees in Xhorhas?

01:04:59.738 --> 01:05:01.643
ASHLEY: We don't have flowers.

01:05:01.643 --> 01:05:03.030
MARISHA: Oh. Yeah, right.

01:05:03.030 --> 01:05:04.338
TALIESIN: Wow.

01:05:04.338 --> 01:05:07.553
TRAVIS: There's no greenery in Xhorhas?

01:05:07.553 --> 01:05:11.501
MARISHA: She's been collecting all those flowers.

01:05:11.501 --> 01:05:12.803
TRAVIS: That's sad.

01:05:12.803 --> 01:05:14.956
TALIESIN: We should fix that, one of these days.

01:05:14.956 --> 01:05:16.834
ASHLEY: I didn't know any different.

01:05:16.834 --> 01:05:18.865
MARISHA: Do they have mushrooms?

01:05:18.865 --> 01:05:20.396
MATT: In the moorlands, they have--

01:05:20.396 --> 01:05:22.779
ASHLEY: In the moorlands, there's some.

01:05:22.779 --> 01:05:25.432
MATT: It's a marshland, where you're from.

01:05:25.432 --> 01:05:29.582
ASHLEY: It's a marshland, so there's
occasionally--

01:05:29.582 --> 01:05:38.632
LAURA: Not colorful mushrooms, just brown and gray
and white? Maybe some black ones.

01:05:38.632 --> 01:05:41.013
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:05:41.013 --> 01:05:41.923
LAURA: Cool.

01:05:41.923 --> 01:05:46.678
TRAVIS: Anybody else have anything else they want
to grab?

01:05:46.678 --> 01:05:48.058
SAM: I think we're good.

01:05:48.058 --> 01:05:49.382
TALIESIN: I got what I needed.

01:05:49.382 --> 01:05:52.740
TRAVIS: You got that plate of food for Caleb that
you ate half of?

01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:57.873
SAM: I got the rest of it in my pockets. It's a
little wet.

01:05:57.873 --> 01:06:04.279
TALIESIN: Is it possible to put some basic
supplies-- Is the ship already well-supplied for a trip?

01:06:04.279 --> 01:06:12.518
MATT: You were given enough supplies for a week or
so off of leaving Darktow, and you guys can create

01:06:12.518 --> 01:06:21.291
your own food and water. There's enough gunpowder
for a dozen or so volleys of cannon fire.

01:06:21.291 --> 01:06:28.876
TALIESIN: I'd say a little bit of spice, so that
the food that we're creating doesn't taste too bland.

01:06:28.876 --> 01:06:30.486
TRAVIS: By all means.

01:06:30.486 --> 01:06:35.232
TALIESIN: Would not be a bad idea, because the
magically-created food is spongy.

01:06:35.232 --> 01:06:39.988
MATT: You can drop a gold piece and be good for
the next two weeks on flavoring the food for you

01:06:39.988 --> 01:06:43.357
and the crew.

01:06:43.357 --> 01:06:46.795
SAM: Should we set off, or are we exploring this
place more?

01:06:46.795 --> 01:06:49.065
TRAVIS: Is it still before sundown?

01:06:49.065 --> 01:06:52.209
MATT: At this point in the day, it's starting to
get close to dusk.

01:06:52.209 --> 01:06:53.762
TRAVIS: Might get some money back.

01:06:53.762 --> 01:06:57.722
MARISHA: 30 gold feels like a lot right now. Just
saying.

01:06:57.722 --> 01:07:01.365
SAM: I wonder what Caleb's up to right now?

01:07:01.365 --> 01:07:04.293
MATT: Which, Caleb, during this time--

01:07:04.293 --> 01:07:07.616
MARISHA: (flashback riff)

01:07:07.616 --> 01:07:10.691
MATT: As you've spent most of the day on the ship
to your own devices, what are you doing?

01:07:10.691 --> 01:07:11.772
TRAVIS: Pooping!

01:07:11.772 --> 01:07:22.409
LIAM: I am a morning pooper, so that happened at
the very beginning. Once I watched Yasha leave the

01:07:22.409 --> 01:07:33.189
boat, I would have snapped Frumpkin to, and set
him purring, and worn him like a scarf. Go back to

01:07:33.189 --> 01:07:41.069
my chambers, and slowly and methodically take out
the silver wire, and cast Alarm outside of my

01:07:41.069 --> 01:07:49.999
doorway. Then take another ten minutes to cast
Leomund's Tiny Hut as a ritual in the room, so

01:07:49.999 --> 01:08:00.148
that the bubble goes up to the door. Then I will
take out the jar of beads, and the thing of ink,

01:08:00.148 --> 01:08:07.203
and the sphere from Twiggy. I would rest that on
the table. Then, as memory serves, there was one

01:08:07.203 --> 01:08:15.397
book with arcane equations open on the table,
which I put away. Was there a second book on the

01:08:15.397 --> 01:08:21.482
table, at that point, as well? There was two we
got in our rush, and Caduceus just gave him one.

01:08:21.482 --> 01:08:23.517
MATT: Correct. You have four books total, I
think.

01:08:23.517 --> 01:08:30.595
LIAM: I would set all four books down in a row,
and the sphere is there, and these two items.

01:08:30.595 --> 01:08:32.397
Stare at them.

01:08:32.397 --> 01:08:39.500
MATT: One thing you notice about the sphere: its
arrangement is entirely different. Remember where

01:08:39.736 --> 01:08:44.895
all the places where you had shifted since you had
gotten it from Twiggy? Since you've returned, it's

01:08:44.895 --> 01:08:50.037
like an entirely new sphere. It has completely
refigured its surface. The bands have shifted. All

01:08:50.037 --> 01:08:53.427
the different places where you'd place your
fingers and thumbs to try to move the different

01:08:53.427 --> 01:09:00.751
hemispheres are in completely different places. It
seems that whatever you triggered to get you to

01:09:00.751 --> 01:09:06.757
the internal space and then returned from reset it
in some way. The puzzle has started all over.

01:09:06.757 --> 01:09:15.454
LIAM: After a minute of feeling Frumpkin purr away
and staring at them, I say in my own language, in

01:09:15.454 --> 01:09:23.568
Zemnian, I say: Well, you piece of shit, you
should probably get to work. I sit down, and I

01:09:23.568 --> 01:09:29.988
will Identify the two items. I will check out the
books, and if any of them are locked, I will cast

01:09:29.988 --> 01:09:31.688
Knock on them to open them.

01:09:31.688 --> 01:09:34.647
MATT: That's easy enough to do. The jar of beads.

01:09:34.647 --> 01:09:38.661
TRAVIS: Every Flavor Beans.

01:09:38.661 --> 01:09:41.463
MARISHA: Each one is a Fireball.

01:09:41.463 --> 01:09:46.220
LAURA: Beads, or beans, or bees?

01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:47.238
MATT: The book.

01:09:47.238 --> 01:09:49.237
LIAM: Bees, or bees, or bees.

01:09:49.237 --> 01:09:52.088
TRAVIS: Beans, and beans, and beans.

01:09:52.088 --> 01:09:56.089
LIAM: And bees, and bees.

01:09:56.089 --> 01:10:02.737
TRAVIS: Fucking ridiculous.

01:10:02.737 --> 01:10:09.570
LAURA: Ugh, I hate that he doesn't say what it is
out loud!

01:10:09.570 --> 01:10:13.796
TALIESIN: This is his favorite thing to do, to
hold a card and watch all of us wait for him to

01:10:13.796 --> 01:10:14.785
show it to us.

01:10:14.785 --> 01:10:16.313
ASHLEY: Was ist das?

01:10:16.313 --> 01:10:19.007
TALIESIN: Was is das? Das ist gut.

01:10:19.007 --> 01:10:22.756
MATT: All right, so that's the spell book.

01:10:22.756 --> 01:10:24.456
LIAM: Is the ink normal?

01:10:24.456 --> 01:10:31.760
MATT: The ink is not normal. It is faintly
enchanted specifically for the intent of scribing

01:10:32.077 --> 01:10:41.031
magical things. For the purposes of scribing
scrolls or scribing spells into spell books, the

01:10:41.031 --> 01:10:51.250
ink will make up to 500 gold worth of scribing.
You still need paper, but essentially, any

01:10:51.250 --> 01:10:59.204
parchment can be made useful as if was the most
premium of spell craft parchment with that ink.

01:10:59.204 --> 01:11:00.990
MARISHA: Fucking score.

01:11:00.990 --> 01:11:06.675
TRAVIS: (whispering) Write it on your body. All
over your body.

01:11:06.675 --> 01:11:09.031
TALIESIN: Your body is a road map of pain.

01:11:09.031 --> 01:11:10.509
TRAVIS: (whispering) Memento.

01:11:10.509 --> 01:11:13.259
LIAM: That is probably it, I would--

01:11:13.259 --> 01:11:17.206
MATT: You have the books, too. The other books.

01:11:17.206 --> 01:11:20.514
LIAM: Oh, right. Yes, correct. Yes, let's inspect
the other three.

01:11:20.514 --> 01:11:25.587
MATT: One of which, after reading through, it is
essentially a number of studies on the effects of

01:11:25.587 --> 01:11:33.713
alchemical compounds on corrupted plant life.
There is one that speaks of public debate records

01:11:33.713 --> 01:11:38.891
within the forum of Zeidel regarding the moral
implications of arcane experimentation on

01:11:38.891 --> 01:11:45.502
prisoners of Ghor Dranas and warnings of the war
with the gods. It's a transcript of a debate

01:11:45.502 --> 01:11:52.957
forum. All you know about Zeidel-- make a history
check, actually.

01:11:52.957 --> 01:11:59.393
LAURA: Zeidel High, that's where Grease takes
place.

01:11:59.393 --> 01:12:00.927
LIAM: 21.

01:12:00.927 --> 01:12:11.730
MATT: From your studies, Zeidel was one of a
number of extremely erudite societies in the Age

01:12:11.730 --> 01:12:20.886
of Arcanum that had harnessed crystals to make
their city hover aloft. There were a handful of

01:12:20.886 --> 01:12:28.628
these in the Age of Arcanum that could travel
across Exandria, cities that were mobile. As far

01:12:29.379 --> 01:12:32.995
as anyone knows, all of them had been wiped out
during the Calamity. Zeidel, as far as you've

01:12:32.995 --> 01:12:39.416
learned, is one of them. That's all you know.

01:12:40.056 --> 01:12:42.106
TALIESIN: (whispering) We're going to find the
lost island of Teddy Ruxpin; I'm ready for this

01:12:42.106 --> 01:12:43.353
shit. Let's bring it.

01:12:43.353 --> 01:12:44.983
LIAM: That's two?

01:12:44.983 --> 01:12:51.456
MATT: Mm-hmm. The last one discusses the theories
behind the ice fields and the underreaches of

01:12:51.456 --> 01:12:54.734
Eiselcross and the beasts that live and endure
it.

01:12:54.734 --> 01:12:56.501
LIAM: Eiselcross.

01:12:56.501 --> 01:13:08.224
MATT: Eiselcross. E-I-S-E-L-C-R-O-S-S. Eiselcross,
you know, is a rather large body of land to the

01:13:08.224 --> 01:13:14.313
north of the main Wildemount continent. It's
considered part of Wildemount overall, but it's

01:13:14.313 --> 01:13:18.075
just a frozen arctic cap.

01:13:18.075 --> 01:13:22.120
LIAM: Not separated in any way, just frozen over,
to the north, or is it separate?

01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:28.136
MATT: It's separate. The Frozen Depths-- there's a
large channel of water that separates the main

01:13:28.753 --> 01:13:38.910
body of Wildemount and Eiselcross, but aside from
two very small ice fishing villages that are

01:13:38.910 --> 01:13:49.922
expansions of the Dwendalian Empire, it is mostly
uninhabited. Nobody really goes there. There's a

01:13:49.922 --> 01:13:54.721
bunch of creatures that have spent a millennia or
more living in that place that are extremely

01:13:54.721 --> 01:13:59.372
dangerous, and it's just snow and ice, so nobody
goes there.

01:13:59.372 --> 01:14:05.569
LIAM: Okay. Well, there's nothing else that I
would do. I would say that all the time they were

01:14:05.569 --> 01:14:12.175
gone, he sits rolling the ball on the table and
speed reading these books. That's it.

01:14:12.175 --> 01:14:14.074
MATT: Cool enough. All right.

01:14:14.074 --> 01:14:18.706
TRAVIS: (whispering) The Frozen Depths.

01:14:18.706 --> 01:14:20.360
MATT: Eiselcross is far north of that.

01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:21.713
TRAVIS: (whispering) Oh, farther north.

01:14:21.713 --> 01:14:23.335
LIAM: (whispering) Even Frozen-er Depths.

01:14:23.335 --> 01:14:24.763
TRAVIS: (whispering) Off the map, or on it?

01:14:24.763 --> 01:14:25.871
MATT: Off the map.

01:14:25.871 --> 01:14:26.462
TRAVIS: Fuck!

01:14:26.462 --> 01:14:30.902
TALIESIN: We're going off the map, man! Probably
need a special boat for that.

01:14:30.902 --> 01:14:34.084
TRAVIS: I thought it was time for some Mercer
Mystery. Shit.

01:14:34.084 --> 01:14:43.346
MATT: You guys manage to make your way back. You
manage to recover your 30 gold from the

01:14:43.346 --> 01:14:52.914
dockmaster, Podderan. You get back to your ship and
you, Caleb, hear the rest of your party return as

01:14:52.914 --> 01:14:56.913
the rest of the crew begins to prepare for setting
sail off the dock.

01:14:56.913 --> 01:15:00.308
MARISHA: I go over to Caduceus and I pull him
aside really quick.

01:15:00.308 --> 01:15:01.652
TALIESIN: Oh!

01:15:01.652 --> 01:15:06.621
MARISHA: Hey Cad, I have a thought.

01:15:06.621 --> 01:15:07.742
TALIESIN: Cool.

01:15:07.742 --> 01:15:13.923
MARISHA: As you may have heard, I have now become
first mate.

01:15:13.923 --> 01:15:17.411
TALIESIN: I didn't know that; people don't tell me
those sorts of things.

01:15:17.411 --> 01:15:18.580
MARISHA: No, really? No one told you?

01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:20.270
TALIESIN: Oh, they might, I just might forget.

01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:21.094
MARISHA: Sure.

01:15:21.094 --> 01:15:22.553
TALIESIN: You may have already told me, I don't
know.

01:15:22.553 --> 01:15:29.361
MARISHA: I probably have. With that
responsibility, I started thinking about the crew,

01:15:29.361 --> 01:15:40.567
and maybe we haven't been treating them the best
that we could be. You know, I think they're okay.

01:15:40.567 --> 01:15:49.794
I don't think that we're abusing them, but maybe
neglecting them? Anyway, I got this extra bottle

01:15:49.794 --> 01:15:54.011
of mead for them, and I thought maybe, with some
of the stuff we got, maybe we could do a nice

01:15:54.011 --> 01:15:57.395
dinner for them or something to just show our
appreciation.

01:15:57.395 --> 01:16:00.201
TALIESIN: I think that's a very good idea.

01:16:00.201 --> 01:16:05.465
MARISHA: I really don't want to get stabbed in the
middle of the night is what I'm thinking, so it's

01:16:05.465 --> 01:16:12.564
a little bit still selfish. But really don't want
to die by one of these fuckers.

01:16:12.564 --> 01:16:17.295
TRAVIS: Show our appreciation to these fuckers.

01:16:17.295 --> 01:16:28.102
TALIESIN: You made Caduceus laugh, oh no. It's not
even me laughing. Well, I can think of worse plans

01:16:28.102 --> 01:16:34.793
than a nice bottle of wine with a card that says,
"Please don't stab me in the middle of the night."

01:16:34.793 --> 01:16:39.081
MARISHA: Oh, a card! I didn't think-- you think
they'd appreciate that? I could write that down, yeah.

01:16:39.081 --> 01:16:43.892
TALIESIN: You know, I actually think that maybe
not giving them the idea in the first place might

01:16:43.892 --> 01:16:51.090
be a better-- well, yeah, I think the big deal
will be when we finally do find a little money,

01:16:51.090 --> 01:16:53.641
making sure it spreads around a bit.

01:16:53.641 --> 01:16:55.053
MARISHA: Good call.

01:16:55.053 --> 01:16:59.774
TALIESIN: But, bringing back some of the mead and
dispersing it amongst the crew is definitely a

01:16:59.774 --> 01:17:04.499
sign that we're probably going to do that when we
do. That is very astute of you.

01:17:04.499 --> 01:17:10.853
MARISHA: Thanks. I feel like a first mate should
be astute.

01:17:10.853 --> 01:17:16.672
TALIESIN: I have a confession. I don't know what
astute means; I heard one of the crew use it, so

01:17:16.672 --> 01:17:18.671
I'm hoping it means a good thing.

01:17:18.671 --> 01:17:21.742
MARISHA: It does; you used it pretty correctly, I
think.

01:17:21.742 --> 01:17:24.051
TALIESIN: I was mirroring something somebody else
said.

01:17:24.051 --> 01:17:30.416
MARISHA: Deductive reasoning, you've got it.
Nailed it, man, yeah. Good work. Okay, I'm going

01:17:30.416 --> 01:17:31.221
to go now.

01:17:31.221 --> 01:17:33.273
TALIESIN: Okay, yeah.

01:17:33.273 --> 01:17:37.760
MARISHA: I start prepping the boat.

01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:41.992
MATT: All right. With that, as everyone gets
prepared, Orly comes out from underneath the deck

01:17:42.063 --> 01:17:51.919
and turns to you and goes, "Captain, where about
are we taking off towards?"

01:17:51.919 --> 01:18:00.445
TRAVIS: Navigator, set course for the Gravid
Archipelago, "ar-chi-pelago", "ar-ka-pelagos".

01:18:00.445 --> 01:18:05.130
MATT: "It's 'ar-chi-pelago'."

01:18:05.130 --> 01:18:08.437
TRAVIS: "Ar-chi-pelago."

01:18:08.437 --> 01:18:14.571
MATT: "We'll go ahead and make sure we're heading
that way." He turns around to the rest of the

01:18:14.571 --> 01:18:20.750
crew, begins giving a couple orders, heading over
and getting his map out. Pull up the anchor and

01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:29.983
slowly, you guys begin to make your way out onto
the Lucidian Ocean just as the sun begins to set.

01:18:29.983 --> 01:18:35.303
Now the sky itself has been pretty gray and
cloudy, and you've been smelling the coming of

01:18:35.303 --> 01:18:41.683
weather. No more than 20 minutes after leaving,
the rain begins.

01:18:43.060 --> 01:18:48.884
TRAVIS: This is fucking unexpected; the skies were
pretty clear.

01:18:49.796 --> 01:18:52.611
LAURA: Caduceus knew that it was going to rain.

01:18:52.611 --> 01:18:53.885
MARISHA: He did.

01:18:53.885 --> 01:18:56.707
TRAVIS: Huh. That is one smart cow.

01:18:59.998 --> 01:19:03.219
MARISHA: I was waiting for your response.

01:19:03.219 --> 01:19:08.622
SAM: How's Yasha? Is she staring off into space,
or just doing stuff?

01:19:08.622 --> 01:19:12.457
(laughter)

01:19:12.457 --> 01:19:20.360
MATT: For most of this travel, you've kept an
aspect of your consciousness looking out for

01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:31.486
errant weather, and there've been a few moments
where some rains have come through-- that brief

01:19:31.486 --> 01:19:40.200
interaction with the Diver's Grave in which a
storm was conjured, but it didn't have the same

01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:46.583
feel that you'd been hoping, whatever this draw
was that drew you southward and to run into these

01:19:46.583 --> 01:19:52.770
friends again at the coast. As you begin to push
further and further towards the direction of the

01:19:52.770 --> 01:19:58.077
storm, there's an excitement in your belly that
you can't describe.

01:19:58.077 --> 01:20:02.020
ASHLEY: Okay, cool.

01:20:02.020 --> 01:20:04.863
TALIESIN: You're looking for a sign?

01:20:04.863 --> 01:20:07.420
ASHLEY: I guess I'm always looking for a sign,
now.

01:20:07.420 --> 01:20:08.746
TALIESIN: Me, too.

01:20:08.746 --> 01:20:14.900
ASHLEY: Yeah? How did you know it was going to
rain? I mean, other than the obvious, gray skies.

01:20:14.900 --> 01:20:21.998
TALIESIN: Well, the skies were turning; the wind
was coming in; and I honestly have to mention my

01:20:21.998 --> 01:20:26.697
knee hurts a little bit on the left side, usually
about an hour beforehand. It was a thing my sister

01:20:26.697 --> 01:20:38.283
did. It was 25 seasons ago, give or take. She's a
piece of work. She's great. A piece of work.

01:20:38.283 --> 01:20:40.666
ASHLEY: It just hurts when it gets cold type of a
thing?

01:20:40.666 --> 01:20:43.627
TALIESIN: Yeah, usually half a day before it
rains.

01:20:43.627 --> 01:20:47.016
ASHLEY: That's a pretty great indication.

01:20:47.016 --> 01:20:48.485
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:20:49.865 --> 01:20:54.873
MATT: As the rain begins to hit the deck itself,
the endless patter of heavy droplets smattering

01:20:54.873 --> 01:21:00.239
against the dark wood, the winds begin to pick up
a little bit, and some of the crew begins to look

01:21:00.239 --> 01:21:05.917
off. You see Marius glance off and go, "Captain,
should we put up the storm sails? The wind's

01:21:05.917 --> 01:21:08.178
"picking up a bit."

01:21:08.178 --> 01:21:13.092
TRAVIS: Of course. Storm sails, it is. On the
double!

01:21:13.092 --> 01:21:16.347
MATT: It takes them a little bit--

01:21:16.347 --> 01:21:21.165
TRAVIS: Why aren't they up already?! [inaudible]

01:21:21.165 --> 01:21:27.723
MATT: They start diminishing the presence of the
regular sails and getting smaller, more durable

01:21:27.723 --> 01:21:30.141
sails pulled up in there.

01:21:30.141 --> 01:21:32.470
MARISHA: I pay attention.

01:21:32.470 --> 01:21:36.319
MATT: You're probably helping them with it. It's
an all hands on deck thing to get this going

01:21:36.319 --> 01:21:41.197
quickly. With that, they begin to pull the sails
into place. The wind immediately picks up again

01:21:41.197 --> 01:21:46.685
once the sails are back in, and the wind is
starting to pick up a bit heavily. You see Orly

01:21:46.685 --> 01:21:54.538
glancing over the edge, his large shell slick with
rain smattering against the backside of it, as he

01:21:54.538 --> 01:21:58.291
turns around towards you and looks at you through
the darkness, the little bit of light there is

01:21:58.291 --> 01:22:06.198
from oil lanterns being held across the deck.
Goes, "Captain, I think we're heading into a

01:22:06.198 --> 01:22:08.996
"proper storm."

01:22:08.996 --> 01:22:15.091
MARISHA: Damn, could you be more ominous, Orly?
Were you trying? I think he was trying.

01:22:15.091 --> 01:22:19.856
MATT: (more ominous) "Captain, we're heading into
a proper storm."

01:22:19.856 --> 01:22:22.139
MARISHA: That was good. I think that was pretty
good.

01:22:22.139 --> 01:22:24.868
MATT: "Smartass."

01:22:24.868 --> 01:22:28.983
TRAVIS: Orly, do you see any way around this
storm, or just through it?

01:22:28.983 --> 01:22:32.177
MATT: "We can if we take a few more days to--"

01:22:32.177 --> 01:22:35.303
TRAVIS: Unacceptable. Push through.

01:22:35.303 --> 01:22:43.658
MATT: "Aye, aye, Captain. All right, everyone! All
hands on deck!"

01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:48.793
SAM: There's flashes of light over there. I don't
know what's happening.

01:22:48.793 --> 01:22:53.568
MATT: As everyone gathers to begin to ford out
into the evening--

01:22:53.568 --> 01:22:55.212
TRAVIS: Safe, practical, measured.

01:22:55.212 --> 01:23:01.248
MARISHA: Yeah, I was almost like: Captain?

01:23:01.248 --> 01:23:04.247
TALIESIN: That's an amazing list of things that
you are not.

01:23:04.247 --> 01:23:09.087
MATT: Your nerves are slightly set on edge as you
can see the distant flashes of lightning arcing

01:23:09.087 --> 01:23:17.986
from storm to ocean, the heavy sheets of wind
obscuring most of these bolts. With that, the rain

01:23:17.986 --> 01:23:29.700
gets heavier and heavier. I need you, as the
captain, to roll a survival check for me, if you

01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:31.633
don't mind. I'll give you advantage on this.

01:23:31.633 --> 01:23:33.530
MARISHA: O Captain! My Captain!

01:23:33.530 --> 01:23:39.575
SAM: Hey, before we go into the storm, you want to
look in the old fate-changing thing?

01:23:39.575 --> 01:23:44.260
TRAVIS: I had advantage on it already. 14.

01:23:44.260 --> 01:23:46.170
MATT: Well, that adds onto advantage.

01:23:46.170 --> 01:23:46.859
TRAVIS: Oh, does it?

01:23:46.859 --> 01:23:49.769
MATT: Yeah, it acts as a luck point. It actually
technically is a third die, but you've already rolled.

01:23:49.769 --> 01:23:51.146
TRAVIS: Okay, 14.

01:23:51.146 --> 01:23:57.794
MATT: Okay, good. Keeping it steady in going in,
the ship's handling it fine. The winds are heavy,

01:23:57.794 --> 01:24:11.382
but the repairs you made, thankfully, have brought
the Balleater up to a very functional ship. The

01:24:11.382 --> 01:24:15.086
crew is experienced, and now that they seem to be
a little more comfortable under your leadership,

01:24:15.086 --> 01:24:19.694
and with the help of the rest of the party - you
guys have taken some time at sea to learn a number

01:24:19.694 --> 01:24:25.335
of skills that are helpful - your first bit of
evening travel into the storm seems to be going

01:24:25.335 --> 01:24:30.279
well. It goes on for a few hours. The storm
doesn't seem to be getting worse, necessarily, but

01:24:30.279 --> 01:24:38.528
the waves are rocking quite a bit. Eventually,
into the early hours of the morning, sleep is

01:24:38.528 --> 01:24:40.562
going to have to come to some of you, at the very
least.

01:24:40.562 --> 01:24:42.044
TALIESIN: I definitely could use some sleep.

01:24:42.044 --> 01:24:46.780
MATT: So you're going to sleep. Who's staying up
for how long to keep watch? Or you can leave it to

01:24:46.780 --> 01:24:49.393
the crew; it's up to you. They're experienced, but
you're the captain.

01:24:49.393 --> 01:24:50.698
TRAVIS: No, I'll stay up.

01:24:50.698 --> 01:24:52.216
MATT: You're staying up? Where are you staying?

01:24:52.216 --> 01:24:53.372
TRAVIS: At the helm.

01:24:53.372 --> 01:24:56.220
MATT: At the helm. You're staying there with Orly.
Orly's staying with you. Anybody else?

01:24:56.220 --> 01:24:58.223
MARISHA: Do you need me to stay up, Captain?

01:24:58.223 --> 01:25:01.468
TRAVIS: No, get some rest. I might need it in a
bit, when this dies down.

01:25:01.468 --> 01:25:07.391
LAURA: I'm going to stand at the back of the
boat.

01:25:07.391 --> 01:25:12.071
MATT: Okay. Standing at the back of the boat.
Everybody else sleeping?

01:25:12.071 --> 01:25:16.663
ASHLEY: I'm going to stay up, of course. Just
watch.

01:25:16.663 --> 01:25:22.903
MARISHA: Before I go to bed, I would like to talk
to Jester, unless Jester is having some alone time

01:25:22.903 --> 01:25:25.382
and it doesn't seem like it's the right time.

01:25:25.382 --> 01:25:29.806
LAURA: No, I just want to be able to Control Water
if something happens.

01:25:29.806 --> 01:25:38.401
MARISHA: Oh, you're here keeping watch? That's a
good call, actually. Going to stay up much longer?

01:25:38.401 --> 01:25:41.244
LAURA: Depends on the storm, I guess.

01:25:41.244 --> 01:25:44.728
MARISHA: Yeah. Motion sick?

01:25:44.728 --> 01:25:47.870
LAURA: I'm okay.

01:25:47.870 --> 01:25:52.496
MATT: The wood is creaking with each shift of the
boat as the waves climb higher and higher,

01:25:52.496 --> 01:25:57.067
occasionally slamming into a valley between.

01:25:57.067 --> 01:26:01.138
LAURA: Feels like a carnival ride.

01:26:01.138 --> 01:26:12.933
MARISHA: It's a little spooky, right? It's fun,
though. Listen, I wanted to talk to you for a

01:26:12.933 --> 01:26:26.467
moment. I'm not really good at this sort of thing,
but about what you said last night, about being a

01:26:26.467 --> 01:26:35.663
good liar. You're right. You really are a good
liar.

01:26:35.663 --> 01:26:37.495
LAURA: Thanks, Beau.

01:26:37.495 --> 01:26:55.223
MARISHA: Yeah. I think it takes one to know one. I
think being a liar means when I know you're not,

01:26:55.223 --> 01:26:58.488
does that make sense?

01:26:58.488 --> 01:27:01.748
LAURA: Yes.

01:27:01.748 --> 01:27:18.207
MARISHA: And when you are. Look, we all get sad. I
want you to know that. I haven't told you really

01:27:18.207 --> 01:27:22.549
any of this, but I also had a lonely childhood.

01:27:22.549 --> 01:27:25.410
LAURA: You did?

01:27:25.410 --> 01:27:33.499
MARISHA: Yeah. I didn't have a lot of friends. My
father was very protective because of certain

01:27:33.499 --> 01:27:44.545
things that he believed, so I wasn't allowed to
have a lot of friends. Really any friends.

01:27:44.545 --> 01:27:48.263
LAURA: You could have used the Traveler in your
life, too, then.

01:27:48.263 --> 01:27:58.005
MARISHA: Maybe. Maybe I would have turned out a
little bit more like you. I admire that in you. In

01:27:58.005 --> 01:28:10.541
my loneliness, I got angry and turned to bad
things, but in your loneliness, you turned to

01:28:10.541 --> 01:28:16.416
creativity. I think that's beautiful. I really
do.

01:28:16.416 --> 01:28:18.910
LAURA: I'll tell you a secret.

01:28:18.910 --> 01:28:21.242
MARISHA: Okay.

01:28:21.242 --> 01:28:25.860
LAURA: Sometimes I'm angry, too.

01:28:25.860 --> 01:28:31.591
MARISHA: Really? I don't think I've ever seen you
angry.

01:28:31.591 --> 01:28:35.232
LAURA: It's a sight to behold!

01:28:35.232 --> 01:28:37.828
MARISHA: I'd like to see it someday.

01:28:37.828 --> 01:28:40.766
LAURA: Someday I'm sure you will.

01:28:40.766 --> 01:28:58.903
MARISHA: I'll be proud of that, too. Anyway, I
know you like to look for friends. I don't know if

01:28:58.903 --> 01:29:05.730
I'm best friend material. That might be a lot of
commitment, especially with my commitment of being

01:29:05.730 --> 01:29:07.245
first mate.

01:29:07.245 --> 01:29:10.771
LAURA: That's really big, yeah. You already have a
lot on your plate.

01:29:10.771 --> 01:29:23.955
MARISHA: It really is, but you don't have to look
far for a friend. Anyway, I'll leave you to it.

01:29:23.955 --> 01:29:29.545
LAURA: I give her a hug from behind as she's
walking away.

01:29:29.545 --> 01:29:33.179
MARISHA: I hug her back from behind.

01:29:33.179 --> 01:29:34.977
LAURA: Thanks, Beau.

01:29:34.977 --> 01:29:37.547
MARISHA: Love you, Jes.

01:29:37.547 --> 01:29:40.567
LAURA: I love you, too.

01:29:40.567 --> 01:29:44.535
MARISHA: Don't stay up too late.

01:29:44.535 --> 01:29:47.339
LAURA: Okay.

01:29:47.339 --> 01:29:53.309
MATT: As the rest of you are enduring the chaos of
the rains above, keeping focused and keeping it

01:29:53.309 --> 01:30:00.618
steady, it's exhausting, both the attention
required for you specifically and the hour being

01:30:00.618 --> 01:30:07.160
late. Thankfully, you slept in, so you can go on
for quite some time. Yasha, where on the ship are

01:30:07.160 --> 01:30:09.122
you standing?

01:30:09.122 --> 01:30:13.926
ASHLEY: Anywhere I can be helping Fjord. If they
need help with the lines--

01:30:13.926 --> 01:30:21.613
MATT: The lines seem to be okay. Fjord's at the
helm with Orly, so they're both towards the back.

01:30:21.613 --> 01:30:32.020
ASHLEY: Okay. I want to stay anywhere on the boat
where the storm is most visible, so I guess--

01:30:32.020 --> 01:30:34.407
MATT: Probably closer to the bow or the foremast.

01:30:34.407 --> 01:30:36.173
ASHLEY: That's where I'll be.

01:30:36.173 --> 01:30:43.306
MATT: Okay. In keeping this going, do you head
back up to help Fjord, or are you heading to rest

01:30:43.306 --> 01:30:44.794
as well?

01:30:44.794 --> 01:30:46.563
MARISHA: I head to rest. He gave me permission
to.

01:30:46.563 --> 01:30:59.496
MATT: It's hypnotic, the sound of rain, and the
movement of the waves, and the flashes of light,

01:30:59.496 --> 01:31:06.890
and the rolling of thunder. You grab the edge of
the rail of the bow, looking out straight into the

01:31:06.890 --> 01:31:15.556
storm that you're passing into. It's a blur of
light and movement and darkness. The horizon

01:31:15.556 --> 01:31:29.251
beyond your vision is obscured; it feels like
you're riding this into a tumultuous sky. You

01:31:29.251 --> 01:31:37.397
begin to fall into a trance, your eyes closing for
but a second. We're going to take a break.

01:31:37.397 --> 01:31:44.071
ALL: (groaning)

01:31:44.071 --> 01:31:53.039
MATT: We'll be right back in a few minutes. In the
meantime, we do have our fantastic Wyrmwood

01:31:53.039 --> 01:32:01.542
giveaway from our friends at Wyrmwood! This is an
awesome holly inlaid dice vault with burmese sal

01:32:01.542 --> 01:32:11.100
burl wood with a red interior. This is a gorgeous
fucking piece. It feels nice. I want to keep it,

01:32:11.100 --> 01:32:15.628
but no, this has to go to one of you lucky
winners. You have to move over to the Critical

01:32:15.628 --> 01:32:20.275
Role Twitch chat at twitch.tv/criticalrole to
enter during the break. You can jump on back to

01:32:20.275 --> 01:32:27.318
Geek &amp; Sundry after, but the keyword tonight is
holiday. Put holiday once in the chat; more than

01:32:27.318 --> 01:32:28.667
once and you'll be disqualified.

01:32:28.667 --> 01:32:29.811
MARISHA: (singing) Celebrate!

01:32:29.811 --> 01:32:35.400
MATT: Exactly. One lucky winner when we return,
from the US or Canada, excluding Quebec, as you

01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:38.766
know. We'll back shortly, and we'll see you then.

01:32:39.505 --> 01:32:44.213
MATT: Welcome back everyone. Before we get back
into it, the winner of our fantastic Wyrmwood

01:32:44.213 --> 01:32:51.914
giveaway tonight is CoreyTHall. CoreyTHall,
congratulations! We'll get that sent to you ASAP.

01:32:51.914 --> 01:32:54.588
I know, there wasn't a single dick joke in that
name. Congratulations.

01:32:54.588 --> 01:32:58.490
TALIESIN: Way to grab that first. Not
"CoreyTHall6" or, you know? He got right in there.

01:32:58.490 --> 01:32:59.489
Well done.

01:32:59.489 --> 01:33:10.568
MATT: So the rest of you are currently either
focused on helping on the ship itself or are down

01:33:10.568 --> 01:33:19.063
below deck, resting, sleeping, or concentrating on
whatever is needed. Taliesin? Oh, you're just

01:33:19.063 --> 01:33:20.580
saying you're down there?

01:33:20.580 --> 01:33:21.598
SAM: He was doing things with flourish, yeah.

01:33:21.598 --> 01:33:24.716
MATT: Gotcha. It's important.

01:33:24.716 --> 01:33:27.662
TALIESIN: That's the nicest way anyone has ever
put that; thank you.

01:33:27.662 --> 01:33:35.268
MATT: As the sound of the storm and the movement
of the ship begins to lull you into this trance,

01:33:35.268 --> 01:33:44.553
your lids grow heavier and heavier, and as your
fingers tighten and clasp the edge of the bow,

01:33:44.553 --> 01:33:58.163
your vision goes dark...and you're kneeling. You
open your eyes, and you're cleaning a fox you

01:33:58.163 --> 01:34:09.484
hunted and pulled from the nearby brush. You look
across the surrounding Iothia Moorland, the sheen

01:34:09.484 --> 01:34:16.553
of the shallow pools dotting the flat swamp brush
landscape, the grays and browns of the valley

01:34:16.553 --> 01:34:23.077
beneath the clouded skies that raised you-- this
is the home you knew. The muted colors are

01:34:23.077 --> 01:34:32.238
comforting. You hear a voice shouted at a
distance. "Yasha!" You turn and see the rest of

01:34:32.238 --> 01:34:40.062
your hunting party of the Dolorav Tribe. Walking
towards you, dirty and smiling, is Zualla, her

01:34:40.062 --> 01:34:45.896
leather marked with mud, her brown eyes barely
visible under her tangled hair. "That's a hearty

01:34:45.896 --> 01:34:55.097
"fox for one, care to share it?" The warmth in your
chest fills you. There's a flash of lightning

01:34:55.429 --> 01:35:05.594
behind you. At that instant, you see Zualla,
fleshless and bone, then darkness once more.

01:35:07.725 --> 01:35:19.944
Another subtle flash, but blue and muted. Another.
A roiling ball of storm clouds grows before you in

01:35:19.944 --> 01:35:28.245
this veil of shadow, swelling as the interior
sparks and flashes with light intensely, and they

01:35:28.245 --> 01:35:39.448
occur more and more rapidly as this sphere of
roiling storm grows and swells. You sense

01:35:39.448 --> 01:35:44.683
something contacting you, and while it isn't
speaking with words, you interpret it through

01:35:44.683 --> 01:36:02.502
language, through your mind. "Loss. Loss is
excruciating. Loss is paralyzing. Loss is

01:36:02.502 --> 01:36:17.350
"inevitable. Loss can bring sorrow, bring hate,
bring cruelty and darkness." Another bright flash.

01:36:19.615 --> 01:36:29.001
You see a muddied field of burning huts. Corpses
lie at your feet, your blade bloodied. A figure

01:36:29.001 --> 01:36:35.906
turns to you, eyes aglow with yellow, their deep
red skin and hooked horns peeking from beneath

01:36:35.906 --> 01:36:45.333
their folded wings. Their smile curls open. "Your
anger is beautiful to behold, Orphan Maker."

01:36:47.478 --> 01:36:59.611
Another flash. Only the rolling storm remains.
(thunder crash) The thoughts return, this voice

01:36:59.611 --> 01:37:09.439
coalesces into more of an actual throaty, deep
timbre. "Loss can instead teach you what is

01:37:09.439 --> 01:37:22.966
"important. It offers perspective. It offers focus,
might, the courage to protect what has not yet

01:37:22.966 --> 01:37:37.795
"been lost. To be alone, to push others away can
prevent loss, but it also prevents growth,

01:37:37.795 --> 01:37:51.656
"strength, purpose. How much, how many will you
lose until you find your strength?" The thunder

01:37:51.656 --> 01:37:58.173
gets louder and louder, cutting through the veil.
You find your consciousness tug at your mind and

01:37:58.173 --> 01:38:05.788
slowly you begin to shake out of this fugue state,
the sound of muffled rain once again growing loud

01:38:05.788 --> 01:38:11.363
around you, the cold sensation of it dripping
through your armor. Another crack of thunder. As

01:38:11.363 --> 01:38:17.721
the dream begins to fade, the voice says, "Show
me. Show me what is important, what is worth

01:38:17.721 --> 01:38:28.273
"protecting. This storm was birthed only for you."
Your eyes flicker wide, and you're back on the

01:38:28.273 --> 01:38:36.491
edge of the ship. The wave hits the bow of the
ship once more. You hold tight, your hair slicked

01:38:36.491 --> 01:38:42.390
down across your face as you look up, and with
that, a single bolt strikes down slamming into the

01:38:42.390 --> 01:38:47.683
front of the ship. Where you expect to see
splintered wood and fire, instead there is just a

01:38:47.683 --> 01:38:58.843
darkened spot, the impact muted. What you see
there instead: a creature, a man-like shape made

01:38:58.843 --> 01:39:05.871
of crackling blue energy. It stands your height,
vaguely human-form, shifting with unstable power.

01:39:05.871 --> 01:39:18.785
Suddenly, two vibrant wings of lightning open from
its back like an angel. It walks towards you.

01:39:25.834 --> 01:39:29.059
ASHLEY: Are you him?

01:39:30.740 --> 01:39:34.656
MATT: It's going to claw across the front of your
body.

01:39:37.563 --> 01:39:40.928
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay, let's go.

01:39:41.499 --> 01:39:47.323
MATT: All right. That is going to be a 16 to hit.
What's your armor class?

01:39:47.323 --> 01:39:48.769
ASHLEY: 14.

01:39:48.769 --> 01:39:49.912
MATT: All right.

01:39:49.912 --> 01:39:53.642
SAM: 14? Don't you have a shield or something?
Jesus.

01:39:53.642 --> 01:39:58.444
LIAM: She can rage; she doesn't need a shield.

01:39:58.444 --> 01:40:01.311
TRAVIS: Rage doesn't raise it.

01:40:03.699 --> 01:40:10.686
MATT: As it claws across the front of your body,
its hand seems to almost pass through the

01:40:10.686 --> 01:40:16.166
resistance of the armor for but a minute before
you feel this shock to your system as it arcs

01:40:16.166 --> 01:40:23.521
through; you feel the lightning pulse through your
body. You suffer eight points of bludgeoning

01:40:23.521 --> 01:40:26.298
damage plus five points of lightning damage.

01:40:26.298 --> 01:40:28.853
LAURA: Would we have seen the lightning hit the
ship?

01:40:28.853 --> 01:40:30.672
MATT: You were below deck, and there--

01:40:30.672 --> 01:40:33.177
LAURA: No, I'm upstairs.

01:40:33.177 --> 01:40:42.898
MATT: Oh, you're upstairs. You guys watched a bolt
of light strike down towards the ship. All you see

01:40:42.898 --> 01:40:48.951
is this faint, dull glow, like a mote of energy
that's rolling around. Make a history check.

01:40:48.951 --> 01:40:50.334
TRAVIS: Me?

01:40:50.334 --> 01:40:51.515
MATT: Yes.

01:40:53.752 --> 01:40:56.049
TRAVIS: Ooh, 16.

01:40:56.868 --> 01:41:03.906
MATT: You've heard tales of something called ball
lightning, bits of storm matter that just scatters

01:41:03.906 --> 01:41:12.477
across. It's usually innocuous and people either
watch it fizzle out or get it thrown overboard. It

01:41:12.477 --> 01:41:18.744
usually happens in the cusp of a storm, and you
watch it dance along the vicinity of Yasha. But

01:41:18.744 --> 01:41:22.767
that's not what you see. I need you to roll
initiative.

01:41:22.767 --> 01:41:25.549
SAM: Oh boy.

01:41:25.549 --> 01:41:29.019
LAURA: All alone?

01:41:29.019 --> 01:41:35.138
ASHLEY: I get advantage now. Oh, fuck. Ten.

01:41:36.352 --> 01:41:38.876
MATT: All right, it's going first.

01:41:39.610 --> 01:41:43.358
ASHLEY: My low fucking initiative!

01:41:47.525 --> 01:41:52.049
MATT: As you reel from it, reaching back for your
blade, the creature seems to be intent on you, its

01:41:52.049 --> 01:41:57.125
form seeming to shift and bend with the wind and
the rain. It's going to reach out towards you for

01:41:57.125 --> 01:42:01.936
two more strikes. That is going to be a 13 to
hit?

01:42:01.936 --> 01:42:04.269
ASHLEY: 14 armor class.

01:42:04.269 --> 01:42:07.068
MATT: That's going to be a 16 to hit.

01:42:07.068 --> 01:42:09.523
ASHLEY: That hits.

01:42:09.523 --> 01:42:13.687
MATT: That is going to be five points of
bludgeoning and two points of lightning.

01:42:13.687 --> 01:42:23.315
ASHLEY: Which brings me to seven total? Okay.

01:42:23.898 --> 01:42:25.143
MATT: It's your turn.

01:42:25.143 --> 01:42:42.357
ASHLEY: Okay. Now that I know this is not who I
thought it was, I am going to rage. I would like

01:42:42.357 --> 01:42:48.725
to rage, and in that rage, I'm going to unfurl my
wings.

01:42:49.358 --> 01:42:55.026
TRAVIS: Oh shit, that's only the second time, I
think.

01:42:55.026 --> 01:43:00.947
MATT: Your skeletal wings flare out from under
your back, your hair blown up from the wind and

01:43:00.947 --> 01:43:07.519
the impact of the wings flying out from underneath
the shawl. It needs to make a wisdom saving throw,

01:43:07.519 --> 01:43:09.230
I believe?

01:43:10.532 --> 01:43:13.053
ASHLEY: Charisma saving throw.

01:43:14.055 --> 01:43:22.352
MATT: That is a six. It has no bonus. It is afraid
of you for how long?

01:43:25.274 --> 01:43:28.727
ASHLEY: Sorry, this is-- one minute.

01:43:28.727 --> 01:43:30.478
SAM: Okay, that's good.

01:43:30.478 --> 01:43:35.145
MATT: All righty. Does it get to save at the end
of its turn, or is it just afraid of you?

01:43:38.430 --> 01:43:47.942
ASHLEY: Hold on. (mumbling) "Be frightened of me
until the end of the next turn."

01:43:47.942 --> 01:43:52.847
MATT: Okay, got you. Oh, and then it lasts for a
minute if you do the extra damage. Once during

01:43:53.023 --> 01:43:56.876
each of your turns you deal extra necrotic damage
to one target when you do damage to it. It equals

01:43:56.876 --> 01:44:02.317
your level, so you do an extra seven points of
necrotic damage once per turn to it. Keep that in mind.

01:44:02.317 --> 01:44:04.571
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:44:04.571 --> 01:44:13.800
MATT: That's the end of the round. You guys look
over and watch Yasha at the end, this mote of

01:44:13.800 --> 01:44:18.591
lightning dancing around her, rolling across, but
slightly hovering above the surface of the boat's

01:44:18.591 --> 01:44:26.566
deck. Suddenly, she unleashes her fallen form, the
wings rising up. Other members of the crew that

01:44:26.566 --> 01:44:33.658
are holding down the ropes see this and take a
step back, not entirely familiar with this appearance.

01:44:33.658 --> 01:44:36.951
TRAVIS: Steady!

01:44:36.951 --> 01:44:39.079
ASHLEY: Only within ten feet.

01:44:39.079 --> 01:44:47.992
MATT: Correct. They're not frightened of you.
They're just really spooked by the reveal. It's

01:44:47.992 --> 01:44:53.757
going to swirl around you; suddenly, it seems to
move with pulses of energy with an unnatural

01:44:53.757 --> 01:44:58.242
speed. Whips to the opposite side and it is going
to attempt to try and slash into the lower back.

01:44:58.242 --> 01:45:04.609
That's going to be a nine and a 21 to hit.

01:45:04.609 --> 01:45:06.580
ASHLEY: Okay, that one hits.

01:45:06.580 --> 01:45:12.055
MATT: Okay. That's going to be eight points of
bludgeoning damage reduced to four because you're

01:45:12.055 --> 01:45:16.981
raging, plus four points of lightning damage.

01:45:16.981 --> 01:45:21.128
ASHLEY: Okay. Oh god, I've lost count.

01:45:21.128 --> 01:45:26.093
MATT: Oh, I'm sorry, it has disadvantage on the
attacks; I need to roll that other attack again.

01:45:26.093 --> 01:45:31.240
Okay, still hits because it's frightened of you.

01:45:31.240 --> 01:45:34.201
ASHLEY: 71 minus seven...

01:45:34.201 --> 01:45:38.714
TALIESIN: I think you're-- because the other one
missed, so I think you're at--

01:45:38.714 --> 01:45:56.790
MATT: It's going to attempt-- all right. It's
going to attempt to move away from you.

01:45:56.790 --> 01:46:02.842
ASHLEY: Can I try and grab it?

01:46:02.842 --> 01:46:05.694
MATT: You can attempt to. I'll let you grapple as
a reaction, sure.

01:46:05.694 --> 01:46:11.702
ASHLEY: I'll grapple as a reaction. Oh, fuck.

01:46:11.702 --> 01:46:14.171
MATT: It's an athletics check for you; because
you're raging, it's at advantage.

01:46:14.171 --> 01:46:15.490
TRAVIS: That's right.

01:46:15.490 --> 01:46:17.104
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:46:17.104 --> 01:46:18.776
LAURA: With advantage!

01:46:20.001 --> 01:46:21.630
ASHLEY: 22.

01:46:21.630 --> 01:46:28.536
MATT: Yeah, it's staying. You reach out and your
hand passes partly through it and it goes numb,

01:46:28.536 --> 01:46:35.772
the field of sparkling energy lightly electrifying
the skin around your hand. But you manage to get

01:46:35.772 --> 01:46:42.689
hold of something-- it's not solid matter, but
something. As it tries to move away, you keep it

01:46:42.689 --> 01:46:47.240
there, barred in place. That ends its turn; it's
your go.

01:46:47.590 --> 01:46:51.616
ASHLEY: All right, I'm going to take out my sword
and I'm going to attack it.

01:46:51.616 --> 01:46:54.554
MATT: Go for it, you've got two attacks.

01:46:54.554 --> 01:47:05.427
ASHLEY: Okay that's-- okay. Oh wow, okay.

01:47:05.427 --> 01:47:07.566
MATT: Are you doing this reckless or not?

01:47:07.566 --> 01:47:12.418
ASHLEY: Oh, shit! Sorry. No, I'll take the first
roll. Sorry. I'm forgetting everything. No, I'm

01:47:12.418 --> 01:47:16.700
not doing reckless. It was 21.

01:47:16.700 --> 01:47:17.961
MATT: 21 hits.

01:47:17.961 --> 01:47:20.598
ASHLEY: Yeah, okay, so I'll take out my sword and
I'll attack.

01:47:20.598 --> 01:47:23.807
MATT: Go for it. Describe to me your attack. As
you're holding it with one hand and pulling the

01:47:23.807 --> 01:47:25.248
blade out...

01:47:25.248 --> 01:47:29.008
ASHLEY: I say: You're not going anywhere. I'll
attack.

01:47:29.008 --> 01:47:32.651
LAURA: What is she doing? What is Yasha doing?

01:47:32.651 --> 01:47:37.671
MATT: You're watching her reaching out and
grabbing this small sphere of sparkling energy.

01:47:37.671 --> 01:47:42.917
She grasps it, grabs her blade, and strikes
through with both hands arcing downward. Because

01:47:42.917 --> 01:47:46.025
you do have two hands, you'd lose the grapple
because it is a two-handed weapon.

01:47:46.025 --> 01:47:48.358
ASHLEY: Okay, that's fine.

01:47:48.358 --> 01:47:51.854
MATT: But you also have sentinel, so if it tries
to get away, you can hit it.

01:47:51.854 --> 01:47:53.953
TALIESIN: Oh my god!

01:47:53.953 --> 01:48:02.751
TRAVIS: Plus your rage damage.

01:48:04.277 --> 01:48:05.938
ASHLEY: 23.

01:48:05.938 --> 01:48:08.120
SAM: That was plus the seven?

01:48:08.120 --> 01:48:10.288
ASHLEY: Plus the seven? No. 30.

01:48:10.288 --> 01:48:12.577
MATT: Plus the seven once per round. 30 points of
damage.

01:48:12.577 --> 01:48:14.941
SAM: Yeah! First attack, second attack!

01:48:14.941 --> 01:48:18.229
ASHLEY: Jeez Louise.

01:48:18.229 --> 01:48:20.950
SAM: Don't you get two attacks?

01:48:20.950 --> 01:48:23.631
MATT: You have two attacks every turn. I know it's
been a while.

01:48:23.631 --> 01:48:25.210
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm sorry!

01:48:25.210 --> 01:48:26.411
TRAVIS: 2d6 on the second one.

01:48:26.411 --> 01:48:27.672
ASHLEY: 2d6 on the second one, okay.

01:48:27.672 --> 01:48:28.892
MATT: I know you forgot your sheet.

01:48:28.892 --> 01:48:32.308
ASHLEY: Yes, I'm sorry. Okay, 12.

01:48:32.308 --> 01:48:34.217
MATT: 12 does not hit.

01:48:34.217 --> 01:48:40.578
ASHLEY: Oh, no, I'm sorry, oh my god. I have to
roll again. I'm sorry. I'm so nervous! I'm sorry.

01:48:40.578 --> 01:48:43.754
That does not hit.

01:48:43.754 --> 01:48:45.104
MATT: What was that?

01:48:45.104 --> 01:48:46.580
ASHLEY: It was a two plus--

01:48:46.580 --> 01:48:52.594
MATT: No, I'm afraid that does not. This first
swing strikes through. You watch the spark flash

01:48:52.594 --> 01:48:58.977
with energy for a second. The second swing goes
wide. It moves around, zigzagging as it curls

01:48:58.977 --> 01:49:02.438
around her. You want to do anything, or just
watching?

01:49:02.438 --> 01:49:05.540
LAURA: No, I want to run forward.

01:49:05.540 --> 01:49:10.537
MATT: Okay, so you rush over in the direction of
where she is and this entity.

01:49:10.537 --> 01:49:12.915
LAURA: Yasha! Do you need help?

01:49:12.915 --> 01:49:13.757
ASHLEY: No!

01:49:13.757 --> 01:49:15.185
LAURA: Okay!

01:49:15.185 --> 01:49:18.586
ASHLEY: But if you want to--

01:49:18.586 --> 01:49:20.436
LAURA: No!

01:49:21.539 --> 01:49:27.343
MATT: Back to its turn. Right there in front of
you, it's going to attempt to use Anger of the

01:49:27.343 --> 01:49:33.417
Tempest. It pulls back from you-- it's no longer
frightened of you. It goes from its defensive

01:49:33.417 --> 01:49:42.591
position to leaning in towards you. It looks up at
the sky, and as a moment there's this slight smell

01:49:42.591 --> 01:49:50.567
of burnt hair that catches your nose before a bolt
of lightning arcs from the sky and slams into you.

01:49:50.567 --> 01:49:54.878
I need you to make a dexterity saving throw. You
do have advantage on this.

01:49:54.878 --> 01:50:00.961
ASHLEY: Yes, I have advantage on, okay. That's
15.

01:50:00.961 --> 01:50:02.604
MATT: 15 does not make it.

01:50:02.604 --> 01:50:05.244
LAURA and ASHLEY: Oh no!

01:50:06.657 --> 01:50:08.073
TRAVIS: Oh, that's a lot.

01:50:08.073 --> 01:50:10.056
ASHLEY: Oh god, that's a lot.

01:50:10.056 --> 01:50:22.731
MATT: You take 23 points of lightning damage, and
as the bolt hits you, your whole upper torso goes

01:50:22.731 --> 01:50:33.608
numb. Your fingers aren't responding, and you drop
your sword to the ground. The creature bends down

01:50:33.608 --> 01:50:43.495
and picks it up, and holds it up, looking right at
you. Doesn't move. Your turn.

01:50:43.495 --> 01:50:46.393
SAM: It has to move. Isn't it frightened?

01:50:46.393 --> 01:50:49.087
MATT: Not anymore. And frightened doesn't force
you to move; you just can't get closer.

01:50:49.087 --> 01:50:50.562
SAM: Oh, shit.

01:50:50.562 --> 01:50:53.332
MATT: It's your turn.

01:50:53.332 --> 01:50:59.236
LAURA: That looked like it hurt. Do you want to be
healed?

01:51:00.522 --> 01:51:13.495
ASHLEY: Maybe? A little lower than I thought I
would be. Can I try to grapple again and try to

01:51:13.495 --> 01:51:15.030
get my sword back?

01:51:15.030 --> 01:51:16.862
MATT: You can use an attack to try and disarm it,
if you'd like.

01:51:16.862 --> 01:51:18.753
ASHLEY: Okay, I'd like to try and disarm.

01:51:18.753 --> 01:51:28.466
MATT: Okay, make another athletics check. You have
advantage on it, because you're raging.

01:51:29.028 --> 01:51:30.933
ASHLEY: 21.

01:51:31.555 --> 01:51:37.114
MATT: No. It had a plus three and rolled a 13, so
16.

01:51:37.114 --> 01:51:39.769
LAURA: Oh, it didn't succeed.

01:51:39.769 --> 01:51:41.802
ASHLEY: I was like, "How?!"

01:51:41.802 --> 01:51:47.230
MATT: As it pulls back, attempting to use
Magician's Judge against you, you reach forward

01:51:47.230 --> 01:51:51.476
and grab it and, for a moment, you're both
struggling back and forth. You manage to rip it

01:51:51.476 --> 01:51:57.480
from its hand, its fingers actually evaporating as
you rip it from its form, and then reform where

01:51:57.480 --> 01:52:02.965
they were previously. The energy's still arcing
around it, and it moves around to almost try and

01:52:02.965 --> 01:52:08.230
move to your flank, but you shift around to face
it. You have your other attack, if you'd like.

01:52:08.230 --> 01:52:21.907
ASHLEY: Yes. Okay. Oh no. (sighs) Forgot to
reckless. Can you call out reckless? I'm

01:52:21.907 --> 01:52:23.024
forgetting everything!

01:52:23.024 --> 01:52:23.840
TRAVIS: Beforehand, yeah.

01:52:23.840 --> 01:52:25.074
ASHLEY: You have to call it out beforehand,
sorry.

01:52:25.074 --> 01:52:26.144
MATT: You call it at the beginning of your turn.

01:52:26.144 --> 01:52:27.120
ASHLEY: 11.

01:52:27.120 --> 01:52:31.379
MATT: 11 does not hit. Goes wide. Unfortunately
your body's still numb from the impact of the

01:52:31.379 --> 01:52:36.880
lightning bolt. You reel from it angrily. That
finishes your turn?

01:52:36.880 --> 01:52:39.071
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:52:39.071 --> 01:52:40.756
LAURA: Can I heal her?

01:52:40.756 --> 01:52:42.880
MATT: Do you want to roll to get involved? Roll
initiative.

01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:47.878
LAURA: I just want to heal her. Oh, I rolled
really low. Six.

01:52:47.878 --> 01:52:51.801
MATT: Six? Yasha, your initiative was?

01:52:51.801 --> 01:52:53.318
TRAVIS: Ten.

01:52:53.318 --> 01:52:54.784
ASHLEY: Yeah, ten.

01:52:54.784 --> 01:52:59.894
MATT: All right. Jester, you can go. I'll let you
in.

01:52:59.894 --> 01:53:04.238
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to run up and go: Keep
going! You're doing great! I'm going to touch her

01:53:04.238 --> 01:53:06.750
arm and cast level three Cure Wounds.

01:53:06.750 --> 01:53:08.542
MATT: Go for it.

01:53:08.542 --> 01:53:13.040
LAURA: 20 points of healing.

01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:15.167
ASHLEY: Oh shit, okay. I'll take it.

01:53:15.167 --> 01:53:19.628
MATT: As Jester touches you and the healing goes
through, the entity before you, its eyes flare

01:53:19.628 --> 01:53:26.059
with intense energy, glaring right at Jester, and
it swells to twice its size with her presence arriving.

01:53:26.472 --> 01:53:28.196
TRAVIS: Jester, get the hell out of there!

01:53:28.196 --> 01:53:35.058
LAURA: I didn't know! I was trying to help! Did I
see that happen, or did it just look like a ball to me?

01:53:35.058 --> 01:53:39.616
MATT: You watch this thing all of a sudden get
brighter and more intense. You don't know what

01:53:39.616 --> 01:53:47.956
that means. Top of the round, its turn. It's going
to take two more strikes at you. Let me see if it

01:53:47.956 --> 01:53:49.894
gets its lightning back.

01:53:49.894 --> 01:53:51.527
SAM: Lightning back?

01:53:51.527 --> 01:53:56.213
MATT: Nope. All right. It's going to make two more
strikes at you, Yasha.

01:53:56.213 --> 01:53:57.150
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:53:57.150 --> 01:54:03.158
MATT: Ooh. That's going to be a 20 and a 21.

01:54:03.158 --> 01:54:04.701
ASHLEY: Yeah, both hit.

01:54:04.701 --> 01:54:12.198
MATT: First one comes at you with ten points of
bludgeoning damage, reduced to five, and five

01:54:12.198 --> 01:54:17.518
points of lightning damage, so ten total. The
other strike, 11 points of bludgeoning damage

01:54:17.518 --> 01:54:21.219
reduced to five, and then three points of
lightning damage.

01:54:21.219 --> 01:54:30.141
ASHLEY: Thanks. No, I would have been under. Okay,
my turn.

01:54:30.141 --> 01:54:35.760
MATT: It appears to be growing in size.

01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:36.994
LAURA: Shit.

01:54:36.994 --> 01:54:39.476
ASHLEY: Fuck. Shit!

01:54:39.476 --> 01:54:41.306
MATT: It's your turn, Yasha.

01:54:41.306 --> 01:54:45.513
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm going to attack again.
Reckless.

01:54:45.513 --> 01:54:50.696
MATT: How are you attacking with it? What are you
doing to attack? It's whipping around you.

01:54:50.696 --> 01:54:55.179
TRAVIS: It hit you anyway, you might as well do
it, because you'll get reckless back.

01:54:55.179 --> 01:55:03.387
ASHLEY: I'm going to try to see if there's a vital
that I can get to anywhere. How much bigger than

01:55:03.387 --> 01:55:04.585
me is he?

01:55:04.585 --> 01:55:09.155
MATT: Right now he's considered a large creature,
so he's about five feet taller than you. You see

01:55:09.155 --> 01:55:14.245
only maybe a three-foot sphere, glowing in its
face, but it's larger than the one foot it once was.

01:55:14.245 --> 01:55:18.390
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to try to go for the big
artery in the--

01:55:18.390 --> 01:55:22.824
MATT: All right, you swing, coming down towards
where the leg is.

01:55:22.824 --> 01:55:24.326
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:55:24.326 --> 01:55:26.180
SAM: Reckless?

01:55:26.180 --> 01:55:29.391
ASHLEY: I did reckless, yeah. 18.

01:55:29.391 --> 01:55:31.696
MATT: 18 hits. Roll damage.

01:55:31.696 --> 01:55:47.999
ASHLEY: Three? Oh, not as good. (counting) Plus
seven, still? Or that was a one-time?

01:55:47.999 --> 01:55:49.923
MATT: No, every turn you do it once, plus seven.

01:55:49.923 --> 01:55:58.606
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm sorry this is taking so long.
19.

01:55:58.606 --> 01:56:03.232
MATT: 19 points of damage on the first strike.
Carves through the center of its leg area, you

01:56:03.232 --> 01:56:09.363
watch as energy dissipates. The leg goes (poof)
and vanishes. Now it's hovering lightly with the

01:56:09.363 --> 01:56:13.647
other leg below it. You see energy sparking around
where the leg's reforming.

01:56:13.647 --> 01:56:16.086
ASHLEY: (groans) Okay.

01:56:16.086 --> 01:56:18.033
MATT: What are you doing with your second attack?

01:56:18.033 --> 01:56:25.763
ASHLEY: Yeah. Since I have reckless, I can still
continue to do it?

01:56:25.763 --> 01:56:27.588
MATT: Reckless for all your attacks this round,
yeah.

01:56:27.588 --> 01:56:30.124
ASHLEY: I'm sorry, guys. Okay, 19.

01:56:30.124 --> 01:56:32.115
MATT: 19 hits. Roll damage a second time.

01:56:32.115 --> 01:56:38.532
ASHLEY: Fuck. Ten.

01:56:38.532 --> 01:56:43.974
MATT: Ten points of damage. You strike it again
with the blade. It seems to shrug it off. It seems

01:56:43.974 --> 01:56:48.062
to be hardier than it was when you started this
fight.

01:56:48.062 --> 01:56:49.725
LAURA: Sorry.

01:56:49.725 --> 01:56:51.775
ASHLEY: Fuck.

01:56:51.775 --> 01:56:54.259
MATT: Anything else you do on your turn?

01:56:54.259 --> 01:56:55.696
TRAVIS: Do you have any bonus actions?

01:56:55.696 --> 01:56:59.159
LAURA: Have you been adding your seven points of
damage, necrotic?

01:56:59.607 --> 01:57:05.978
ASHLEY: I only get it once, I don't get the
necrotic damage also on the second.

01:57:05.978 --> 01:57:07.033
TRAVIS: Both strikes.

01:57:07.033 --> 01:57:08.915
ASHLEY: Both strikes? Okay.

01:57:08.915 --> 01:57:10.902
MATT: What, the necrotic damage?

01:57:10.902 --> 01:57:12.213
TRAVIS: For divine fury.

01:57:12.213 --> 01:57:13.979
MATT: Divine fury you get once per turn.

01:57:13.979 --> 01:57:16.659
TRAVIS: Yeah, but the sword has necrotic, right?
Or your shroud?

01:57:16.659 --> 01:57:19.816
MATT: The necrotic damage from your shroud also
happens once per turn.

01:57:19.816 --> 01:57:21.454
TRAVIS: Oh, sorry. Yeah, just once.

01:57:21.454 --> 01:57:26.618
ASHLEY: Okay. Sounds good. Oh, fuck, I don't know
what to do! I feel like I have to fight this thing

01:57:26.618 --> 01:57:27.684
on my own.

01:57:27.684 --> 01:57:29.279
TRAVIS: Do you have a bonus action?

01:57:29.279 --> 01:57:32.320
MATT: You have a bonus action, you haven't done
anything.

01:57:32.320 --> 01:57:35.498
TRAVIS: Features and traits.

01:57:35.498 --> 01:57:38.266
ASHLEY: What?

01:57:38.266 --> 01:57:40.604
TRAVIS: Check your features and traits.

01:57:40.604 --> 01:57:42.579
SAM: D&amp;D Beyond!

01:57:42.579 --> 01:57:44.988
TRAVIS: It's all pretty awesome.

01:57:44.988 --> 01:57:46.681
MATT: Is that your turn?

01:57:46.681 --> 01:57:48.086
ASHLEY: Yeah, that's my turn.

01:57:48.086 --> 01:57:49.612
MATT: Jester, you're up.

01:57:49.612 --> 01:57:50.963
LAURA: I mean, should I do anything?

01:57:50.963 --> 01:57:53.664
MATT: What are you doing, Jester?

01:57:53.664 --> 01:57:57.930
LAURA: I mean, I guess I'm going to back away from
it, since I made it worse.

01:57:57.930 --> 01:58:00.448
MATT: Okay. How far do you back away?

01:58:00.448 --> 01:58:03.675
LAURA: Ten feet.

01:58:03.675 --> 01:58:07.019
MATT: Okay, you back away ten feet.

01:58:07.019 --> 01:58:16.996
LAURA: Sorry! Didn't mean to join anything and
didn't know what's going on here. Looks pretty crazy.

01:58:16.996 --> 01:58:26.942
MATT: As Jester backs away, top of the round, it's
now the entity's turn. First let's see if it gets

01:58:26.942 --> 01:58:33.146
its-- it gets its lightning back. It's going to
first attempt to move away from you. It's going to

01:58:33.146 --> 01:58:36.360
hover away and actually begin to rise up in the
air. You do get an attack of opportunity towards it.

01:58:36.360 --> 01:58:37.690
LAURA: Sentinel!

01:58:37.690 --> 01:58:41.024
MATT: It is not reckless, though, because it's
only on your turn.

01:58:41.024 --> 01:58:43.635
ASHLEY: 13.

01:58:43.635 --> 01:58:54.318
MATT: 13 misses. The swing goes wide and it hovers
15 feet up, near the mast where the lower sail is.

01:58:54.318 --> 01:59:00.228
It hovers up in this space and looks up in the air
once more as its electrified wings unfurl and its

01:59:00.228 --> 01:59:04.429
arm goes up as it stares down at you. You see
these large blue sparks where its eyes would be.

01:59:04.429 --> 01:59:09.750
As it pulls its arm down, the bolt strikes down
and slams into you once more. Make another

01:59:09.750 --> 01:59:12.200
dexterity saving throw with advantage.

01:59:12.200 --> 01:59:19.448
ASHLEY: Okay. 20 total.

01:59:19.448 --> 01:59:31.350
MATT: That succeeds. Okay, and that's a good
thing. You take 13 points of lightning damage and

01:59:31.350 --> 01:59:36.888
you do not drop your weapon. You shrug off the
numbness from the impact, but it is 15 feet above you.

01:59:36.888 --> 01:59:37.906
ASHLEY: Fuck.

01:59:37.906 --> 01:59:46.325
MATT: Which is out of your melee range. It's up
near the sail on the mast. It's your turn.

01:59:46.325 --> 01:59:56.879
ASHLEY: I call out to the Stormlord. What do you
want me to do?!

01:59:56.879 --> 01:59:59.200
MATT: Do you wait for a response?

01:59:59.200 --> 02:00:01.329
ASHLEY: Yes.

02:00:01.329 --> 02:00:08.062
MATT: No response. Just the sound of thunder and
lightning rolling.

02:00:08.062 --> 02:00:10.334
ASHLEY: Okay. I move closer to it.

02:00:10.334 --> 02:00:12.167
MATT: How do you move closer to it?

02:00:12.167 --> 02:00:13.764
ASHLEY: Is it directly above me?

02:00:13.764 --> 02:00:18.920
MATT: It's above and back, up by the mast and the
sail. About 15 feet above you.

02:00:18.920 --> 02:00:23.760
ASHLEY: (sighs) This is so stressful when it's
about you!

02:00:23.760 --> 02:00:25.571
LAURA: Can you fly?

02:00:25.571 --> 02:00:27.323
MATT: Not with the wings, no.

02:00:27.323 --> 02:00:31.521
ASHLEY: No. I wish. Yeah, I'm going to try to
climb up.

02:00:31.521 --> 02:00:36.639
MATT: Okay. I mean, they're designed for climbing.
So you go ahead, and as it's up in the air, you

02:00:36.639 --> 02:00:41.942
rush over to the mast. Climbing your way up, you
get to the edge and there is, where the sail is in

02:00:41.942 --> 02:00:46.840
the side, you're holding onto it off the point,
you manage to get within melee range of it. You

02:00:46.840 --> 02:00:53.384
used your action to call out to the Stormlord and
waiting for the response, but you're now adjacent

02:00:53.384 --> 02:00:54.269
to it.

02:00:54.269 --> 02:00:56.374
ASHLEY: Okay. So I'll just keep my sword at the
ready.

02:00:56.374 --> 02:01:02.492
MATT: Okay. Jester? You move further away, get
closer, re-enter, what are you doing?

02:01:02.492 --> 02:01:07.980
LAURA: Yasha, what do you want me to do?

02:01:07.980 --> 02:01:11.395
ASHLEY: I don't know. Just stay safe.

02:01:11.395 --> 02:01:15.720
LAURA: Ah! I back up ten more feet.

02:01:15.720 --> 02:01:23.379
MATT: Okay, ten more feet. Next round. You watch
its physical size reduce. It shrinks back down to

02:01:23.379 --> 02:01:31.540
its original form, matching yours one-to-one. As
it floats there, its electrical wings not flapping

02:01:31.540 --> 02:01:39.739
but arced, held aloft at each of its sides. On its
turn it does not get its lightning back. It's

02:01:39.739 --> 02:01:44.299
going to attempt to strike at you twice. As it
rushes you towards the mast, trying to knock you

02:01:44.299 --> 02:01:48.870
off, the first one's going to be a shove attack to
try and knock you off the mast. That's a natural

02:01:48.870 --> 02:01:56.951
one. No. It goes to shove towards you and you just
pull in, and it zips past. At that point it comes

02:01:56.951 --> 02:02:02.200
back around to try and claw at you with its other
hand. That's going to be a 20 to hit.

02:02:02.200 --> 02:02:03.601
ASHLEY: That hits.

02:02:03.601 --> 02:02:10.541
MATT: That is five points of bludgeoning damage.
It would be ten, but it's reduced to five. Then

02:02:10.541 --> 02:02:18.336
four points of lightning damage. It's going to
attempt to move up further away from you, leaning

02:02:18.336 --> 02:02:24.634
further up and away from the masthead. Make
another attack of opportunity, if you'd like.

02:02:24.634 --> 02:02:30.554
(background music, thunder)

02:02:30.554 --> 02:02:38.568
ASHLEY: Okay. Wait, still? Just one? Well, the
first one was good. 21 again.

02:02:38.827 --> 02:02:42.828
MATT: 21 hits. Roll damage. And because of your
sentinel feat, you prevent it from moving.

02:02:42.828 --> 02:02:45.499
TRAVIS: Yes, you drop their speed to zero!

02:02:45.499 --> 02:02:47.129
MARISHA: Sentinel, bitches!

02:02:47.129 --> 02:02:49.189
ASHLEY: Ten.

02:02:49.189 --> 02:02:55.012
MATT: Ten points of damage. As you arc past with
your blade and strike at it, attempting to move

02:02:55.012 --> 02:03:01.197
away, its midsection separates, and the lower legs
fizzle out and no longer exist. Suddenly, its

02:03:01.197 --> 02:03:07.992
lower part of its torso flickers and then grows
two new legs made of pure electrical energy. As

02:03:07.992 --> 02:03:13.130
the wind's blowing by, your hair being thrown past
your shoulders, the rain beating down on your face

02:03:13.130 --> 02:03:16.963
as you're holding onto the side of the mast,
leaning your arm in and then striking with your

02:03:16.963 --> 02:03:23.755
two-handed sword best you can, it can't seem to
find its way beyond your reach. Now it's your turn.

02:03:23.755 --> 02:03:27.463
ASHLEY: Okay. I'm going to try to take my blade
and put it through its torso.

02:03:27.463 --> 02:03:33.409
MATT: Okay. I'm going to say, because of the
rain-- didn't do it last round, but as you're now

02:03:33.409 --> 02:03:39.410
up in this area holding on while also striking it,
you have disadvantage on the attacks because it is

02:03:39.410 --> 02:03:41.210
a two-handed weapon.

02:03:41.210 --> 02:03:44.318
TRAVIS: But if you make it reckless, it's a
straight roll.

02:03:44.318 --> 02:03:46.018
ASHLEY: Oh yeah, reckless.

02:03:46.018 --> 02:03:48.128
MATT: All right.

02:03:48.128 --> 02:03:55.766
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay. That's...18.

02:03:55.766 --> 02:03:58.900
MATT: 18 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

02:04:02.030 --> 02:04:04.288
LAURA: Oh, that's good!

02:04:04.288 --> 02:04:16.070
ASHLEY: (counting) 19-- oh, I'm sorry. 25.

02:04:17.621 --> 02:04:26.380
MATT: 25 points of damage to it. As it arcs past,
one of the wings gets shaved off and falls and

02:04:26.380 --> 02:04:31.584
sputters and turns to particle sparks before
vanishing into the storm. The wing begins to

02:04:31.584 --> 02:04:34.582
flicker to regrow itself. You have your second
attack.

02:04:34.582 --> 02:04:39.740
ASHLEY: Oh, that's right. Okay. Still reckless.

02:04:39.740 --> 02:04:42.388
MATT: Well, reckless is preventing the
disadvantage.

02:04:42.388 --> 02:04:43.865
ASHLEY: Oh, shit, okay. That doesn't hit.

02:04:43.865 --> 02:04:44.988
MATT: What'd you roll?

02:04:44.988 --> 02:04:46.337
ASHLEY: A three plus-- nine.

02:04:46.337 --> 02:04:49.700
MATT: No. This one, unfortunately, goes wide with
the second strike as your arm's looped through the

02:04:49.700 --> 02:04:54.150
mast, trying to hold on. This time, the other wing
manages to flicker in and it just ducks out of the

02:04:54.150 --> 02:04:57.239
way. Jester, staying out or coming in?

02:04:57.239 --> 02:04:59.199
LAURA: Staying out of it!

02:04:59.199 --> 02:05:02.610
MATT: All right. Back to the top of the round. The
creature now-- you see the storm growing heavier

02:05:02.610 --> 02:05:07.578
and heavier around, the rain now is coming in
heavy sheets across the deck. The crew's yelling

02:05:07.578 --> 02:05:14.142
off; you hear the shouting of the crewmen trying
to keep the sails from tearing. You hear Fjord

02:05:14.142 --> 02:05:20.615
shouting orders to them from behind, but the words
aren't reaching you. It's just noise lost in the

02:05:20.615 --> 02:05:25.497
wind and the sound of the storm around you. It's
going to attempt-- we'll see.

02:05:25.497 --> 02:05:28.158
LAURA: You can do it, Yasha!

02:05:28.158 --> 02:05:31.399
MATT: It does get its lightning strike back.

02:05:31.399 --> 02:05:34.978
ASHLEY: (whispering) Fuck.

02:05:34.978 --> 02:05:40.880
MATT: As you're up there holding the mast, knowing
it's coming, as the creature puts its hands up,

02:05:40.880 --> 02:05:47.868
the bolt strikes down once more, slamming to you
and the mast. I need you to make another dexterity

02:05:47.868 --> 02:05:49.017
saving throw.

02:05:49.017 --> 02:05:52.003
MARISHA: No, we just got that repaired.

02:05:52.003 --> 02:05:54.229
TALIESIN and TRAVIS: Advantage.

02:05:54.229 --> 02:05:57.438
ASHLEY: 11.

02:05:57.453 --> 02:06:02.543
(dice rolling)

02:06:02.573 --> 02:06:04.249
TRAVIS: Come on!

02:06:05.894 --> 02:06:09.463
MATT: Wasn't a great roll, so you're lucky on
that. That's 13 points of lightning damage.

02:06:09.463 --> 02:06:11.331
LAURA: Oh my god.

02:06:11.331 --> 02:06:14.099
ASHLEY: (singing) I'm still standing.

02:06:14.099 --> 02:06:16.268
ALL: (singing) Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:06:16.268 --> 02:06:18.294
MATT: But you drop your sword.

02:06:18.294 --> 02:06:20.144
ALL: (groaning)

02:06:20.144 --> 02:06:21.485
ASHLEY: Okay.

02:06:21.485 --> 02:06:31.346
MATT: Which falls onto the ground. That's its
turn. What are you doing, Yasha?

02:06:31.346 --> 02:06:35.161
ASHLEY: Oh my god! Okay, okay, okay.

02:06:35.161 --> 02:06:37.943
MARISHA: Merry Christmas.

02:06:37.943 --> 02:06:42.437
TRAVIS: How far away is it from you on that mast?

02:06:42.437 --> 02:06:44.169
ASHLEY: Yeah. How far-- yeah.

02:06:44.169 --> 02:06:47.946
MATT: It's five feet from you. It hasn't pulled
away. You've prevented it from leaving, but it did

02:06:47.946 --> 02:06:50.186
manage to knock the weapon out of your hands.

02:06:50.186 --> 02:06:53.580
ASHLEY: Is there anything in the torso?

02:06:53.580 --> 02:07:00.312
MATT: The energy that it seems to create has this
field of electricity. You do see the bright points

02:07:00.312 --> 02:07:06.577
where its eyes are that are these two beacons of
intense electrical energy and the faint heart-like

02:07:06.577 --> 02:07:11.568
glow that emanates from the center of its torso.
The full thing is made of energy from different

02:07:11.568 --> 02:07:15.633
intensity levels that almost give variations to
colors of blue and white.

02:07:15.633 --> 02:07:23.870
ASHLEY: Okay. I want to try to grab it again. Grab
it from the inside and try to pull it off of the mast.

02:07:23.870 --> 02:07:27.688
MATT: Make an athletics check. You do not have
disadvantage on this. You have advantage because

02:07:27.688 --> 02:07:29.045
of your--

02:07:29.045 --> 02:07:30.128
ASHLEY: I have advantage?

02:07:30.128 --> 02:07:31.608
MATT: Because you're raging still.

02:07:31.608 --> 02:07:35.363
ASHLEY: Okay, that's right. Both the same. 12.

02:07:35.363 --> 02:07:45.221
MATT: Okay. 12? That's a 16. You try and reach out
for it and it just manages to duck out of the way.

02:07:45.221 --> 02:07:48.598
You have a second attack. Are you doing another
grapple or are you--?

02:07:48.598 --> 02:07:50.246
ASHLEY: I'm going to try to do another grapple.

02:07:50.246 --> 02:07:56.219
MATT: Go for it. With advantage, because you're
raging.

02:07:56.219 --> 02:07:58.494
ASHLEY: 22.

02:07:58.494 --> 02:08:06.351
MATT: Yeah, it does not succeed on that. As it
ducks past the one, you reach out, getting to the

02:08:06.351 --> 02:08:11.154
limits of your arm reach from the edge of the
mast. As you do, your hand plunges into its chest.

02:08:11.154 --> 02:08:14.120
ASHLEY: Can I pull it off of the mast?

02:08:14.120 --> 02:08:22.870
MATT: Next turn, if you can keep it up. As you're
holding it there and it's grappled, its strength

02:08:22.870 --> 02:08:28.749
is zero. Your hand is plunged about two or three
inches into the energy field that is its torso.

02:08:28.749 --> 02:08:34.136
You can feel your fingers vibrating with energy,
and it hurts. It hurts, but you grit your teeth.

02:08:34.136 --> 02:08:39.062
Glaring past, you can hear the waves crashing
around you. The ship itself is rocking with heavy

02:08:39.062 --> 02:08:46.003
momentum, but you're focused on the moment. On its
turn, it's going to attempt to attack you. That is

02:08:46.003 --> 02:08:58.738
a natural one. You are lucky, but the second one
is a 13 again. Wait, wait. Yeah, 13. Plus six. Shit!

02:08:58.738 --> 02:09:00.300
LAURA: Oh my god.

02:09:00.300 --> 02:09:03.801
TRAVIS: One below your AC!

02:09:03.801 --> 02:09:10.711
MATT: Man, okay. Oh, let's see. It does not get
its lightning back. That would have been good to

02:09:10.711 --> 02:09:12.533
roll beforehand.

02:09:12.533 --> 02:09:23.444
ASHLEY: Okay, my turn? I want to keep holding, and
I want to squeeze even harder whatever it is that

02:09:23.444 --> 02:09:28.240
I'm holding onto, and try to yank down and take us
off the--

02:09:28.240 --> 02:09:31.440
MATT: Make a strength check.

02:09:31.440 --> 02:09:33.737
SAM: The mast.

02:09:33.737 --> 02:09:39.324
ASHLEY: The mast. Do I roll again?

02:09:39.324 --> 02:09:41.690
TRAVIS: Strength has advantage.

02:09:41.690 --> 02:09:42.712
ASHLEY: Fuck, I'm sorry!

02:09:42.712 --> 02:09:44.351
MATT: With the raging. It's okay.

02:09:44.351 --> 02:09:45.129
ASHLEY: 16.

02:09:45.129 --> 02:09:52.762
MATT: You begin to pull, and it's giving. As
you're yanking, its wings are flickering and

02:09:52.762 --> 02:09:56.560
sputtering. Its arms are reaching up to grab
yours, and its eyes that have been intensely

02:09:56.560 --> 02:09:59.036
burrowed toward you begin to go wide.

02:09:59.036 --> 02:10:05.689
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to keep trying to pull
whatever that is.

02:10:05.689 --> 02:10:10.827
MATT: Make another strength check with advantage.

02:10:10.827 --> 02:10:13.043
ASHLEY: 17.

02:10:13.043 --> 02:10:22.306
MATT: (crackling, pop) As you pull it from the
chest, the body flickers out, and you're falling,

02:10:22.306 --> 02:10:29.675
the momentum pulling you off of the mast. You
plummet 15 feet, slamming into the deck.

02:10:29.675 --> 02:10:32.828
LAURA: As I see her falling, I run forward to try
to cast Cure Wounds right as she--

02:10:32.828 --> 02:10:36.748
MATT: You take five points of bludgeoning damage
from the impact, reduced to two because of the

02:10:36.748 --> 02:10:43.936
rage. You crack down onto the hard wood of the
deck.

02:10:43.936 --> 02:10:46.075
ASHLEY: I am at one hit point.

02:10:46.075 --> 02:10:47.453
MATT: No fucking way!

02:10:47.453 --> 02:10:49.822
ASHLEY: Yes fucking way.

02:10:49.822 --> 02:10:54.666
MATT: That's two episodes in a row.

02:10:54.666 --> 02:10:58.162
ASHLEY: I'm just laying there, and I'm holding--

02:10:58.162 --> 02:11:03.639
LAURA: I look down at her. Are you okay?

02:11:03.639 --> 02:11:04.644
ASHLEY: I don't know.

02:11:04.644 --> 02:11:05.879
LAURA: What did you do?

02:11:05.879 --> 02:11:08.485
ASHLEY: I don't know. Am I still holding it?

02:11:08.485 --> 02:11:12.550
MATT: Your fingers are buzzing. You look, and
there's nothing there.

02:11:12.550 --> 02:11:15.958
ASHLEY: Did you see that thing?

02:11:15.958 --> 02:11:21.492
LAURA: I saw a ball of light. I saw you fall off
the mast.

02:11:21.492 --> 02:11:23.789
ASHLEY: You didn't see any creature or anything?

02:11:23.789 --> 02:11:31.262
LAURA: It was a big ball of lightning stuff. Your
sword fell down. Here.

02:11:31.262 --> 02:11:35.258
ASHLEY: I was fighting something. It was a
creature.

02:11:35.258 --> 02:11:38.648
LAURA: What did it look like? Cure Wounds.

02:11:38.648 --> 02:11:48.763
ASHLEY: It was winged, and it had red eyes. It
looked like it was a ball of lightning.

02:11:48.763 --> 02:11:52.508
LAURA: What do you think it meant?

02:11:52.508 --> 02:12:14.877
ASHLEY: I don't know. I was standing in front of
the ship, and I had a vision of home. Then I woke

02:12:14.877 --> 02:12:19.547
up, and then the lightning struck. When it came
down, it was the creature.

02:12:19.547 --> 02:12:22.977
LAURA: It only wanted to fight you.

02:12:22.977 --> 02:12:33.239
ASHLEY: I guess, if you didn't even see it. I
grabbed something out of it. I guess it was its

02:12:33.239 --> 02:12:36.272
heart. Now it's gone.

02:12:36.272 --> 02:12:40.619
LAURA: Yasha, this is really important.

02:12:43.967 --> 02:12:49.140
ASHLEY: Okay. Well, maybe I need to think on this
a little bit more.

02:12:49.140 --> 02:12:51.638
LAURA: We should talk to Caduceus.

02:12:51.638 --> 02:12:52.438
ASHLEY: Yeah?

02:12:52.438 --> 02:12:57.168
LAURA: Mm-hmm. He has really good insight. Plus,
he makes good tea. It will make you feel better.

02:12:57.168 --> 02:12:59.574
TRAVIS: Jester, what's going on down there?

02:12:59.574 --> 02:13:03.608
LAURA: Yasha fought a ball of lightning, but
everything's okay! She's good. We're going to get

02:13:03.608 --> 02:13:05.620
some tea, though.

02:13:05.620 --> 02:13:09.107
ASHLEY: I'm okay!

02:13:09.107 --> 02:13:13.505
LAURA: The mast looks like it maybe got burned a
little again.

02:13:13.505 --> 02:13:17.260
TRAVIS: Maybe see to the repairs first before you
get your fucking tea.

02:13:17.260 --> 02:13:25.353
LAURA: Why don't you stop being a dick?! I crawl
up and cast Mending on the sail. By the way,

02:13:25.353 --> 02:13:27.422
you're healed 14 points.

02:13:27.422 --> 02:13:34.569
MATT: Because the lightning mostly impacted Yasha,
the damage was minimal to the mast, thankfully. If

02:13:34.569 --> 02:13:46.708
she had succeeded on her save... Oh wait, no. You
succeeded the last save.

02:13:46.708 --> 02:13:48.121
SAM: She did succeed.

02:13:48.121 --> 02:13:52.620
MATT: The mast is a little damaged, but with
immediate Mending, I'll say you can undo it a

02:13:52.620 --> 02:13:53.816
little bit.

02:13:53.816 --> 02:13:58.038
LAURA: Plus, I'm one of the carpenters. I've got
extra skills.

02:14:01.798 --> 02:14:05.887
ASHLEY: I'm going to go talk to Caduceus.

02:14:05.908 --> 02:14:18.089
MATT: Okay, as you continue to help keep this ship
going through the middle of this storm, you make

02:14:18.089 --> 02:14:22.600
your way below deck and find Caduceus in his
chamber.

02:14:22.600 --> 02:14:26.020
TALIESIN: (snoring)

02:14:26.020 --> 02:14:27.466
ASHLEY: Hey, Caduceus.

02:14:27.466 --> 02:14:29.621
TALIESIN: (grunting awake)

02:14:29.621 --> 02:14:30.740
ASHLEY: Hey.

02:14:30.740 --> 02:14:37.308
TALIESIN: (sniffing) Did you get hit by
lightning?

02:14:37.308 --> 02:14:39.364
ASHLEY: Yes.

02:14:39.364 --> 02:14:44.310
TALIESIN: Wow. Hold on. Oh man.

02:14:44.310 --> 02:14:46.481
ASHLEY: Sorry. Burning hair is not a good smell.

02:14:46.481 --> 02:14:54.477
TALIESIN: No, that's nice. It's fresh. Hold on.
Let's do something about that. I'm going to do

02:14:54.477 --> 02:15:01.586
another quick Cure Wounds at a ridiculous level.
Let's do it at third. Let's give you another 3d8

02:15:01.586 --> 02:15:06.658
plus five to get that going. What happened?

02:15:06.658 --> 02:15:14.622
ASHLEY: Well, I was-- oh, that would've been
nice.

02:15:14.622 --> 02:15:15.682
TALIESIN: 21.

02:15:15.682 --> 02:15:35.932
ASHLEY: Okay. I was at the bow of the boat, and I
was trying to connect with the Stormlord. I don't

02:15:35.932 --> 02:15:39.203
know. I ended up getting a vision.

02:15:39.203 --> 02:15:41.139
TALIESIN: You got a sign?

02:15:41.139 --> 02:15:43.598
ASHLEY: I think I did.

02:15:43.598 --> 02:15:53.059
TALIESIN: I mean, (sniffs). Yeah, that's a sign.
You got hit. You're pretty fried.

02:15:53.059 --> 02:15:58.070
ASHLEY: I'm pretty fried. I fought something,
though. It was lightning that came down and then

02:15:58.070 --> 02:16:00.629
turned into a creature.

02:16:00.629 --> 02:16:15.042
TALIESIN: I don't know how to make this sound
normal. Did it know you? Did it feel like it was

02:16:15.042 --> 02:16:16.971
there for you?

02:16:16.971 --> 02:16:18.857
ASHLEY: Yes.

02:16:18.857 --> 02:16:34.729
TALIESIN: Well, somebody's paying attention.
Congratulations. You probably need some food.

02:16:34.729 --> 02:16:36.701
Where's your sword?

02:16:36.701 --> 02:16:39.247
ASHLEY: It's here.

02:16:39.247 --> 02:16:53.584
TALIESIN: That's amazing. Well, now that you seem
to have the Stormlord's attention, now what?

02:16:53.584 --> 02:17:01.038
ASHLEY: I think I need to keep trying to find him.
I guess he's found me.

02:17:01.038 --> 02:17:03.147
TALIESIN: Now what?

02:17:03.147 --> 02:17:13.266
ASHLEY: That's what I was going to ask you. I'm
going to go back upstairs.

02:17:13.266 --> 02:17:26.079
TALIESIN: I'll go to the kitchen and put the
kettle on. I think sometimes you're running toward

02:17:26.079 --> 02:17:31.999
something so fast that you don't remember why you
were running in the first place. I've had some

02:17:31.999 --> 02:17:42.905
moments like that with these people a couple
times, where I felt distant from what's important.

02:17:42.905 --> 02:17:57.605
Recently, I've been thinking about this river in
the northern forest. It's not a big river. You

02:17:57.605 --> 02:18:03.634
watch the river, and every year it's a little
different. We used to make little leaf boats and

02:18:03.634 --> 02:18:10.888
put them down and watch them, and every year it
was a different path, but it's all going to end up

02:18:10.888 --> 02:18:21.176
in the ocean eventually. I think that you're going
to be ending up in your destination real soon. I

02:18:21.176 --> 02:18:31.771
think we're barreling toward it. Congratulations.
I'm going to go make tea. (sighs) And I go make tea.

02:18:31.771 --> 02:18:33.926
ASHLEY: I go back upstairs.

02:18:33.926 --> 02:18:41.380
MATT: Since it was your vision, if you wish to
look over the words that were told to you, keep

02:18:41.380 --> 02:18:44.508
that for you.

02:18:44.508 --> 02:18:47.621
SAM: (whispering) Clues.

02:18:47.621 --> 02:18:49.817
LAURA: Clues and clues!

02:18:49.817 --> 02:18:51.367
TALIESIN: Zoinks.

02:18:51.367 --> 02:18:54.085
LAURA: Clues and clues and beans and beans.

02:18:54.085 --> 02:18:59.887
SAM: Look at the first letter of every word, and
then take those and rearrange them.

02:18:59.887 --> 02:19:02.528
TALIESIN: Let's get some lemon juice and a
candle.

02:19:02.528 --> 02:19:08.134
ASHLEY: I go back upstairs.

02:19:08.134 --> 02:19:10.408
MATT: To the dock-- To the deck?

02:19:10.408 --> 02:19:11.818
ASHLEY: Mm-hmm.

02:19:11.818 --> 02:19:12.528
MATT: Okay.

02:19:12.528 --> 02:19:15.048
ASHLEY: I just want to sit outside still.

02:19:15.048 --> 02:19:18.014
MATT: Okay. You make your way back up.

02:19:18.014 --> 02:19:20.290
LAURA: Is it peaceful?

02:19:20.290 --> 02:19:28.148
MATT: It's still raining, but the storm's ferocity
seems to have slowly diminished. It's still a storm.

02:19:28.148 --> 02:19:30.546
TRAVIS: Less steady!

02:19:30.546 --> 02:19:39.267
MATT: But you seem to have come through the bulk
of its intensity and danger, and, from your

02:19:39.267 --> 02:19:43.430
experience, knowing you're probably starting to
come out the other end. It'll be a few more hours

02:19:43.430 --> 02:19:46.444
of fording this, but you're getting pretty
exhausted.

02:19:46.444 --> 02:19:54.796
TRAVIS: I may send Orly or someone else below
decks to go wake up Beau.

02:19:54.796 --> 02:20:02.501
MATT: Okay. Orly stays, but sends Marius to go
ahead and wake Beau, comes back up, and she's in

02:20:02.501 --> 02:20:06.506
his wake.

02:20:06.506 --> 02:20:08.731
MARISHA: 'Sup?

02:20:08.731 --> 02:20:13.407
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're through the worst of it.
Listen, if, for some reason, Yasha comes back up

02:20:13.407 --> 02:20:19.349
and starts swinging at a bunch of balls of light
on the front of the ship, just don't get involved.

02:20:19.349 --> 02:20:21.756
I'm going to sleep.

02:20:21.756 --> 02:20:22.786
MARISHA: What?

02:20:22.786 --> 02:20:26.148
TRAVIS: (mumbling) Nothing, just going
(gibberish).

02:20:26.148 --> 02:20:27.410
MARISHA: Okay...

02:20:27.410 --> 02:20:35.748
LAURA: (yawns) I'm so tired. Thank you, Caduceus.

02:20:35.748 --> 02:20:38.139
TALIESIN: The ship's name makes sense, now.

02:20:38.139 --> 02:20:41.715
LAURA: The Balleater. Oh, yeah!

02:20:41.715 --> 02:20:44.899
TALIESIN: The eater of balls.

02:20:44.899 --> 02:20:47.756
LAURA: And also, our captain also eats balls!

02:20:47.756 --> 02:20:52.674
TALIESIN: Everybody. Now I feel better about the
whole-- It's a good name. It works out.

02:20:52.674 --> 02:20:56.636
LIAM: (singing to the tune of "Moon River") Ball eater.

02:20:56.636 --> 02:21:01.718
LAURA: You feeling any better, Yasha?

02:21:01.718 --> 02:21:14.384
ASHLEY: I guess so. I'm just trying to make sense
of all this still. I feel like-- I had some

02:21:14.587 --> 02:21:24.454
visions of home that made me very happy and sad at
the same time, but it must all mean something.

02:21:24.454 --> 02:21:28.715
LAURA: What made you leave in the first place?

02:21:28.715 --> 02:21:34.825
(background music)

02:21:34.825 --> 02:21:36.155
ASHLEY: Um.

02:21:38.815 --> 02:21:43.729
LAURA: It had to be scary, right, if that's all
you'd ever known.

02:21:44.120 --> 02:21:48.100
ASHLEY: Yeah, I had to leave.

02:21:48.100 --> 02:21:50.599
LAURA: Why?

02:21:50.599 --> 02:22:09.460
ASHLEY: I did something that... I did something
that wasn't the right thing to do, according to my tribe.

02:22:09.460 --> 02:22:16.575
LAURA: You can say what it is; (whispering) I
won't tell anyone.

02:22:16.575 --> 02:22:30.939
ASHLEY: In my tribe, we have a matriarch of the
tribe, the Champion, and her name is the Skyspear.

02:22:30.939 --> 02:22:33.093
LAURA: Whoa, that's a cool name.

02:22:33.093 --> 02:22:46.630
ASHLEY: And when you become a part of the tribe,
you take a blood oath and you get a name, and I

02:22:46.630 --> 02:22:59.064
was given the name Orphan Maker. When you become a
part of the tribe, as time goes on, you are given

02:22:59.064 --> 02:23:21.258
a mate. But I fell in love with someone else that
was not chosen for me, and we got married privately.

02:23:21.258 --> 02:23:25.341
LAURA: (gasps) You got married, Yasha?

02:23:25.341 --> 02:23:56.460
ASHLEY: I did. But they found out and the
punishment for that is death, and they killed her

02:23:56.460 --> 02:24:15.269
and I ran away, so I... I am a coward, I guess.

02:24:15.269 --> 02:24:22.869
LAURA: Yasha, you're not a coward. You're one of
the bravest people I've ever met.

02:24:22.869 --> 02:24:41.499
ASHLEY: Thank you, Jester. In our tribe, when you
get married, it's for life. Even if she's gone,

02:24:41.499 --> 02:24:46.859
she'll always be mine.

02:24:46.859 --> 02:24:49.344
LAURA: What was her name?

02:24:49.344 --> 02:24:51.911
ASHLEY: Her name was Zuala.

02:24:52.954 --> 02:24:54.855
LAURA: That's really beautiful.

02:24:54.855 --> 02:25:07.854
ASHLEY: Yeah. I left and I'm sure they were coming
after me and I got into the wastes of Xhorhas, and

02:25:07.854 --> 02:25:21.634
something happened. There's time that I cannot
account for. I was out there for months by myself,

02:25:21.634 --> 02:25:36.007
and it seems like I woke up months later and I
looked different and I felt different. I woke up

02:25:36.007 --> 02:25:58.245
at an altar of the Stormlord, and he saved me. For
what, yet, I don't know, but hopefully I can be a

02:25:58.245 --> 02:26:09.082
better champion for him and fulfill whatever
purpose he has for me.

02:26:09.082 --> 02:26:15.566
LAURA: Did he heal your heart, or are you still
sad?

02:26:15.566 --> 02:26:27.782
ASHLEY: I don't know if my heart could ever be
healed, but I'm okay with that. I feel like if it

02:26:28.042 --> 02:26:42.769
were put back together then that means Zuala
would be gone. I know one day I want to go back

02:26:42.769 --> 02:27:04.021
there. I don't know where she was buried, but I
have so many flowers to bring to her. I don't know

02:27:04.021 --> 02:27:24.731
what all this means, but I sometimes... I don't
know. I don't know.

02:27:24.771 --> 02:27:29.951
(background music)

02:27:29.951 --> 02:27:33.702
LAURA: I didn't know.

02:27:34.122 --> 02:27:40.902
ASHLEY: I feel like sometimes I get nervous to get
close to people because I feel like I lose them.

02:27:40.902 --> 02:27:42.494
And then Molly.

02:27:42.494 --> 02:27:44.431
LAURA: And then Molly.

02:27:44.431 --> 02:27:50.243
ASHLEY: I feel like I'm either very unlucky or
cursed, and I don't believe in luck.

02:27:50.243 --> 02:27:57.291
LAURA: Curses and luck, they go together. If you
don't believe in luck, you can't believe in being

02:27:57.291 --> 02:27:59.172
cursed either.

02:27:59.172 --> 02:28:00.880
ASHLEY: That's true.

02:28:00.880 --> 02:28:11.136
LAURA: And Molly's still with us, the same way
that your beautiful wife is.

02:28:11.136 --> 02:28:21.642
ASHLEY: Yeah, I think so. I think so. This is very
good tea.

02:28:21.642 --> 02:28:23.385
TALIESIN: Been saving it.

02:28:23.385 --> 02:28:25.795
ASHLEY: What's in here?

02:28:25.795 --> 02:28:28.748
LAURA: (gasps) You didn't put some of that stuff
in, did you?

02:28:28.748 --> 02:28:39.204
TALIESIN: Oh, that-- no. Although, I did think
about it. No, this is from home. This is the

02:28:39.204 --> 02:28:44.941
Cadence family, if I recall? It's very minty.

02:28:44.941 --> 02:28:48.136
TRAVIS and LIAM: (laughing) Very minty.

02:28:48.136 --> 02:28:50.775
MARISHA: (laughing) The Cadence family?

02:28:50.775 --> 02:28:52.515
ASHLEY: Like it's people?

02:28:52.515 --> 02:28:56.514
TALIESIN: I mean, technically, yeah.

02:28:56.514 --> 02:28:57.838
ASHLEY: I'm fine with it.

02:28:57.838 --> 02:29:00.396
LAURA: Minty people.

02:29:00.411 --> 02:29:05.061
(background music)

02:29:05.066 --> 02:29:10.572
ASHLEY: Well, maybe this is best kept to us.

02:29:11.676 --> 02:29:13.606
LAURA: I won't tell anyone.

02:29:13.829 --> 02:29:18.146
ASHLEY: I mean, I'm fine with saying it, but it's
a long story, and...

02:29:18.146 --> 02:29:23.295
LAURA: Thank you for trusting us with that,
Yasha.

02:29:23.295 --> 02:29:25.333
ASHLEY: Of course.

02:29:25.333 --> 02:29:29.393
LAURA: Sometimes it helps to say things out loud.

02:29:29.393 --> 02:29:34.075
ASHLEY: I think so. I feel like I'm trying to
learn that from you, Jester.

02:29:34.075 --> 02:29:35.246
LAURA: Really?

02:29:35.246 --> 02:29:37.048
ASHLEY: Yeah, you say what's on your mind--

02:29:37.048 --> 02:29:38.975
TALIESIN: It's true.

02:29:38.975 --> 02:29:40.256
ASHLEY: It's good.

02:29:40.256 --> 02:29:41.104
LAURA: Yeah.

02:29:41.104 --> 02:29:43.748
ASHLEY: I'm going to try to start doing that.

02:29:43.748 --> 02:29:45.418
TALIESIN: To surviving.

02:29:45.418 --> 02:29:47.087
ASHLEY: To surviving.

02:29:47.087 --> 02:29:48.888
LAURA: To minty families!

02:29:48.888 --> 02:29:51.819
ASHLEY: To minty families.

02:29:51.819 --> 02:29:55.048
TALIESIN: The mintiest.

02:29:55.048 --> 02:30:03.118
MATT: As the storm subsides slowly over the next
few hours, and one by one, you all eventually find

02:30:03.118 --> 02:30:08.388
yourself feeling comfortable to return to your
quarters for an evening's rest, the day's travel

02:30:08.388 --> 02:30:16.000
comes to a complete circle. The morning comes with
clear skies as the distant gray fades in the

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:23.726
north. Another half day's travel leads you to see
a few bodies of land on the horizon.

02:30:23.726 --> 02:30:28.666
TRAVIS: Hey, nice job.

02:30:28.666 --> 02:30:31.006
MARISHA: (sharply inhales) Yeah!

02:30:31.006 --> 02:30:32.753
TRAVIS: Really?

02:30:32.753 --> 02:30:34.186
MARISHA: I was awake the whole night.

02:30:34.186 --> 02:30:36.530
TRAVIS: Which direction are we pointed?

02:30:36.530 --> 02:30:41.186
MARISHA: The one we're heading in, Fjord, which is
the only way we could be heading.

02:30:41.186 --> 02:30:42.857
TRAVIS: Which is?

02:30:42.857 --> 02:30:45.357
MARISHA: Towards our destiny.

02:30:45.357 --> 02:30:51.150
(laughter)

02:30:51.150 --> 02:30:52.327
TRAVIS: Orly--

02:30:52.327 --> 02:30:54.963
MARISHA: Orly, which way are we heading?

02:30:54.963 --> 02:31:04.043
MATT: "I reckon towards them islands." He points
over to the bodies of land on the horizon.

02:31:04.043 --> 02:31:06.210
MARISHA: Towards the islands.

02:31:06.210 --> 02:31:07.297
TRAVIS: Nice job.

02:31:07.297 --> 02:31:09.804
MARISHA: Thank you.

02:31:09.804 --> 02:31:19.336
MATT: Now, coming across the Gravid Archipelago--
and you'd know this a little bit, though you've

02:31:19.533 --> 02:31:27.718
not actually traveled to these before-- you can
see this trio of islands are rather rocky and are

02:31:27.718 --> 02:31:31.887
only marked with small pockets of trees and
jungle. Much of the land on these islands is

02:31:31.887 --> 02:31:40.525
steep, volcanic peaks with sheer cliff faces
pockmarked with caves. Similar makeup as a lot of

02:31:40.525 --> 02:31:45.195
Darktow, actually; they were both probably created
from similar volcanic activity from under the

02:31:45.195 --> 02:31:54.438
ocean, but not very welcoming-looking islands.
With little safe land to navigate or exploit for

02:31:54.438 --> 02:32:03.947
resources, there is very few reason for ships to
stop here. As you guys begin to make your way, you

02:32:03.947 --> 02:32:07.942
can see the two nearest to you and the third
there. What would you like to do?

02:32:07.942 --> 02:32:12.503
TRAVIS: Plot a course that would put us right in
the middle of all three.

02:32:12.503 --> 02:32:19.646
MATT: "Okay." He goes ahead and continues the path
of the Balleater.

02:32:19.646 --> 02:32:23.804
TALIESIN: We'll work on it.

02:32:23.804 --> 02:32:29.205
MATT: Nothing quite like high fantasy.

02:32:29.205 --> 02:32:31.812
ASHLEY: Balleater?

02:32:31.812 --> 02:32:34.027
TRAVIS: It was the Squalleater.

02:32:34.027 --> 02:32:36.765
MARISHA: So we just painted it--

02:32:36.765 --> 02:32:39.478
ASHLEY: The boat is called the Balleater?

02:32:39.478 --> 02:32:40.197
SAM and LAURA: Yes.

02:32:40.197 --> 02:32:41.632
ASHLEY: The Balleater.

02:32:41.632 --> 02:32:43.206
TALIESIN: Eater of balls.

02:32:43.206 --> 02:32:45.330
MARISHA: To be fair, he's eaten some balls--

02:32:45.330 --> 02:32:47.733
TALIESIN: And now you have as well.

02:32:47.733 --> 02:32:49.165
ASHLEY: I've eaten some balls?

02:32:49.165 --> 02:32:50.644
TALIESIN: You just bested a ball.

02:32:50.644 --> 02:32:51.668
MARISHA: You busted a ball.

02:32:51.668 --> 02:32:54.257
ASHLEY: Oh, that's true, that's true.

02:32:54.257 --> 02:32:58.670
SAM: We've all had a couple of balls in our mouth
before.

02:32:58.670 --> 02:33:01.752
TALIESIN: We spent six days in that Happy Fun
Ball.

02:33:01.752 --> 02:33:02.506
LAURA: Yeah!

02:33:02.506 --> 02:33:04.246
TALIESIN: That's a lot of balls.

02:33:04.246 --> 02:33:06.417
MARISHA: That's true! I'm telling you, it's a
ball-themed year.

02:33:06.417 --> 02:33:10.178
TALIESIN: This is practically a ball pit, yeah.

02:33:10.178 --> 02:33:13.087
LIAM: Matthew Mercer's ball campaign.

02:33:13.087 --> 02:33:14.084
MARISHA: Sorry.

02:33:14.084 --> 02:33:17.594
MATT: This is going to go real poorly.

02:33:17.594 --> 02:33:18.605
TRAVIS: It's not our fault!

02:33:18.605 --> 02:33:22.150
TALIESIN: Nice lightning strike as you said that,
by the way. It was like--

02:33:22.150 --> 02:33:24.328
TRAVIS: Real poorly. (cracking)

02:33:24.328 --> 02:33:25.679
MATT: This can be turned off.

02:33:25.679 --> 02:33:27.812
TALIESIN: I was enjoying it.

02:33:27.812 --> 02:33:28.762
MATT: Fun device.

02:33:28.762 --> 02:33:30.684
LAURA: That is awesome, yeah.

02:33:30.684 --> 02:33:35.294
MATT: Thank you, Jeremy Crawford, for showing me
that at the Stream of Many Eyes.

02:33:35.294 --> 02:33:37.462
LIAM: What is the plan, Captain?

02:33:37.462 --> 02:33:42.262
TRAVIS: We're going to head for the middle of all
that.

02:33:42.262 --> 02:33:44.594
LAURA: Do we have to go to the bottom of the ocean
again?

02:33:44.594 --> 02:33:52.383
TRAVIS: Maybe. We're going to keep our eyes on the
islands as we proceed, but I do recall it being

02:33:52.383 --> 02:33:54.095
under the depths.

02:33:54.095 --> 02:33:57.983
MARISHA: You are searching for this based on a
vision?

02:33:57.983 --> 02:34:05.215
LAURA: Also, it was in Avantika's journal, wasn't
it? You remember, Caleb.

02:34:05.215 --> 02:34:06.233
LIAM: Exactly.

02:34:06.233 --> 02:34:07.777
MATT: It was, yes.

02:34:07.777 --> 02:34:09.808
SAM: Did it have an exact location or anything?

02:34:09.808 --> 02:34:12.218
MATT: No, it just said somewhere between them.

02:34:12.218 --> 02:34:18.279
TRAVIS: In my dream, I saw from the top down, and
I hit the water right in the middle of them and

02:34:18.279 --> 02:34:21.006
kept going deeper and deeper.

02:34:21.006 --> 02:34:23.484
ASHLEY: Right in the middle of these three
islands?

02:34:23.484 --> 02:34:25.684
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

02:34:25.684 --> 02:34:26.605
ASHLEY: Cool.

02:34:26.605 --> 02:34:34.452
MARISHA: Fjord, there are presumably three
spheres, yeah? Right?

02:34:34.452 --> 02:34:36.109
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:34:36.109 --> 02:34:49.614
MARISHA: You have one. You have two, and then
Avantika. I'm checking if you think that this

02:34:49.614 --> 02:34:51.987
could unleash Uk'otoa.

02:34:51.987 --> 02:34:59.787
TRAVIS: Nope. Nope, nope. She put hers in the
first temple. I have two. This might be numero

02:34:59.787 --> 02:35:02.670
dos, and then I'll keep the third.

02:35:02.670 --> 02:35:17.561
MARISHA: Okay. What if, theoretically, playing
devil's advocate here, maybe Uk'otoa was like: I

02:35:17.561 --> 02:35:27.628
should make four, one extra, just in case-ies.
Vandran has that one, but he's also already put it

02:35:27.628 --> 02:35:32.083
in the temple, and this third one could unleash
him!

02:35:32.083 --> 02:35:38.273
TRAVIS: Wait. Four spheres, three temples?

02:35:38.273 --> 02:35:39.673
LAURA: It's possible.

02:35:39.673 --> 02:35:41.693
SAM: Or ten spheres.

02:35:41.693 --> 02:35:42.423
LAURA: You don't know.

02:35:42.423 --> 02:35:43.533
SAM: You have no idea.

02:35:43.533 --> 02:35:45.003
MARISHA: Maybe it only takes three?

02:35:45.003 --> 02:35:48.161
TALIESIN: I'm not sure that elder gods work in
baker's dozens.

02:35:48.161 --> 02:35:53.120
LIAM: It would be very embarrassing for the people
who designed that temple we visited.

02:35:53.120 --> 02:35:57.808
TRAVIS: That's right, and as Caleb can attest to,
that image that we saw in the temple was three

02:35:58.028 --> 02:36:05.669
spheres. Three chosen people underneath the
entity. I don't think they would have an influx of

02:36:05.669 --> 02:36:07.103
spheres to deal with.

02:36:07.103 --> 02:36:13.630
SAM: What if someone else was searching for these
powerful spheres and maybe was lying in wait at

02:36:13.630 --> 02:36:17.433
this temple, knowing that someone would maybe come
bring one to it?

02:36:17.433 --> 02:36:23.633
TRAVIS: Nott, you are a fantastic rogue. You
wouldn't let such an ambush befall us, would you?

02:36:23.633 --> 02:36:29.524
SAM: I would if it were underwater because I would
not be there to prevent it.

02:36:29.524 --> 02:36:31.017
LAURA: You're not going to come with us again?

02:36:31.017 --> 02:36:35.089
SAM: Fuck no! Look what happened last time. There
was a crazy ghost lady!

02:36:35.089 --> 02:36:37.059
LAURA: Yeah, and we defeated her.

02:36:37.059 --> 02:36:38.288
SAM: No, she got away.

02:36:38.288 --> 02:36:39.928
LAURA: Yeah, but we still defeated her.

02:36:39.928 --> 02:36:41.059
SAM: We almost died.

02:36:41.059 --> 02:36:44.270
LAURA: We got the orb! We also stole some shit.

02:36:44.270 --> 02:36:45.284
SAM: Did we?

02:36:45.284 --> 02:36:50.401
LAURA: Yeah. I got at least five gold.

02:36:50.401 --> 02:36:58.872
TRAVIS: Those that want to come can. I will
understand if you want to sit this one out.

02:36:58.872 --> 02:37:02.727
LIAM: We've come a long way.

02:37:02.727 --> 02:37:08.168
TALIESIN: You're welcome to stay, although there
might be a conversation about how much of the cut

02:37:08.168 --> 02:37:10.094
of whatever we find you get to keep.

02:37:10.094 --> 02:37:15.375
TRAVIS: Agreed, and I couldn't guarantee your
safety up here while we're below the murky depths.

02:37:16.646 --> 02:37:17.607
LAURA: Nott.

02:37:17.607 --> 02:37:18.616
SAM: Yes?

02:37:18.616 --> 02:37:23.197
LAURA: I don't want to force you to come, of
course not. You can stay up here if you want, and

02:37:23.197 --> 02:37:31.964
I'm not going to talk about dangers, and murky
depths, and stuff like that. I will say that you

02:37:31.964 --> 02:37:39.925
saved my life, and I don't feel as comfortable
going into a battle without you.

02:37:39.925 --> 02:37:51.634
SAM: Fjord, you have a thing or two to learn from
Jester about talking to people and engaging them

02:37:51.634 --> 02:38:04.877
on a personal level. She has what I would call the
expert touch. She gets people. She sees into their

02:38:04.877 --> 02:38:08.635
hearts and souls. You are just a bastard man.

02:38:08.635 --> 02:38:16.276
TRAVIS: I hear there is an ancient button factory
at the bottom of the waters--

02:38:16.276 --> 02:38:22.933
SAM: Wait, Button Wonka's factory? With the
boompa-loompas?

02:38:22.933 --> 02:38:25.035
TRAVIS: You've heard of it as well!

02:38:25.035 --> 02:38:32.258
SAM: I have! No one's seen anyone come in or out
of that factory, and yet it makes buttons every

02:38:32.258 --> 02:38:35.607
day! How do they do it?!

02:38:35.607 --> 02:38:41.633
TRAVIS: The story's been lost to the ages, since
the great Calamity.

02:38:41.633 --> 02:38:43.415
SAM: All right.

02:38:43.415 --> 02:38:44.994
TRAVIS: You're in?

02:38:44.994 --> 02:38:46.379
SAM: This fucker.

02:38:46.379 --> 02:38:56.026
(laughter)

02:38:56.026 --> 02:38:58.220
SAM: Let's find it; then we'll decide later.

02:38:58.220 --> 02:39:04.653
TRAVIS: Fair enough. Just in case, can we keep an
eye on the islands as we're moving in for any sign

02:39:04.653 --> 02:39:07.976
of structures, civilization?

02:39:07.976 --> 02:39:12.608
MATT: Yeah, whoever is helming that will be able
to make either two separate perception checks or

02:39:12.608 --> 02:39:13.297
aid one to make--

02:39:13.297 --> 02:39:15.193
TRAVIS: I'll send the perceptive fuckers up to the
crow's nest.

02:39:15.193 --> 02:39:17.019
TALIESIN: Yep, take a look.

02:39:17.019 --> 02:39:21.847
MATT: Are you aiding Caduceus, or are you both
rolling?

02:39:21.847 --> 02:39:24.960
MARISHA: It's you? Am I doing this?

02:39:24.960 --> 02:39:26.564
TRAVIS: You're aiding Cad.

02:39:26.564 --> 02:39:28.054
MARISHA: I'll aid you.

02:39:28.054 --> 02:39:29.227
TALIESIN: Perception rolls?

02:39:29.227 --> 02:39:31.596
MATT: Perception, yeah. With advantage.

02:39:31.596 --> 02:39:40.274
TALIESIN: Perception with advantage. That's awful!
That's terrible. 14.

02:39:40.274 --> 02:39:44.564
MATT: Okay. You keep an eye out there and spend
the next hour or so, as you guys are coming into

02:39:44.743 --> 02:39:50.027
position, scanning the shores of each of the
islands. There's no sign of civilization. They're

02:39:50.027 --> 02:40:04.342
mostly dangerous, jagged, rocky shores with
pebbled beaches, and bits and pieces of hints of

02:40:04.342 --> 02:40:10.687
mangrove clusters at certain points of the shore,
and elements of the occasional bit of jungle you

02:40:10.687 --> 02:40:16.634
can see in pockets or valleys on each island. For
the most part, you don't see any sign of civilization.

02:40:16.634 --> 02:40:29.143
TALIESIN: Nothing so far. Mr. Caleb, I know this
is not your favorite thing to do, but we may

02:40:29.143 --> 02:40:35.670
require the use of your friend for a little while.

02:40:35.670 --> 02:40:37.943
LIAM: What are you going to do with the cat?

02:40:37.943 --> 02:40:42.808
TALIESIN: Well, I was hoping that maybe the cat
would get uncomfortable in either a bird or an

02:40:42.808 --> 02:40:45.425
octopus form and do a little reconnaissance.

02:40:45.425 --> 02:40:52.445
LIAM: There is no bird or octopus; he is a cat. I
am out of supplies for-- he's a cat.

02:40:52.445 --> 02:40:55.187
SAM: I got incense, by the way.

02:40:55.187 --> 02:41:03.045
LIAM: Everything just changed. How much did you
get?

02:41:03.045 --> 02:41:09.555
SAM: I got 50 gold worth, which was a lot.

02:41:09.555 --> 02:41:11.302
LIAM: May I have it?

02:41:11.302 --> 02:41:14.062
SAM: You may have all of it.

02:41:14.062 --> 02:41:19.449
LIAM: Thank you. Where do we want to dump him in
the ocean again for a look around?

02:41:19.772 --> 02:41:23.860
TALIESIN: We're looking for signs of civilization
on land or in the sea at the moment. What are you--?

02:41:23.860 --> 02:41:28.050
TRAVIS: If we haven't seen anything on land, I'd
like to get in the middle and then send him below.

02:41:28.050 --> 02:41:30.200
MARISHA: Are we in the middle yet?

02:41:30.200 --> 02:41:33.885
MATT: I'd say about now you guys could have
reached what would be considered as close to the

02:41:33.885 --> 02:41:36.234
center as Orly can possibly maneuver the boat.

02:41:36.234 --> 02:41:41.690
MARISHA: No carvings in caves, holes in the stone
walls?

02:41:41.690 --> 02:41:44.871
LIAM: I can do two things. We can send Frumpkin
into the air and--

02:41:44.871 --> 02:41:52.651
MATT: I mean, there are caves all over the
volcanic, rocky cliffs and peaks that come out

02:41:52.651 --> 02:42:00.611
each island. There are caverns and shelves. It was
a violently-made series of islands.

02:42:00.611 --> 02:42:06.155
MARISHA: Did you go underwater in your vision?

02:42:06.155 --> 02:42:08.022
TRAVIS: In my mind pictures? Yeah, I did.

02:42:08.022 --> 02:42:09.718
TALIESIN: Your mind pictures.

02:42:09.718 --> 02:42:15.453
LIAM: I'll sit down on the deck and start drawing
in chalk on the wood and putting my cat in the

02:42:15.649 --> 02:42:21.539
middle of it, even though he has only been a cat
for a few days. Ten minutes later we have an octopus.

02:42:21.539 --> 02:42:28.500
LAURA: Wait, so if I was petting Frumpkin when you
were doing that, would he slowly lose his fur and

02:42:28.500 --> 02:42:31.417
grow tentacles, or would it be a poof?

02:42:31.417 --> 02:42:34.240
LIAM: We'll try that sometime, okay?

02:42:34.240 --> 02:42:35.293
LAURA: Okay.

02:42:35.293 --> 02:42:37.943
TALIESIN: Are you hoping for that Ladyhawke moment
where you have a furry octopus?

02:42:37.943 --> 02:42:38.832
TRAVIS: Yeah!

02:42:38.832 --> 02:42:41.739
ASHLEY: A furry octopus.

02:42:41.739 --> 02:42:44.866
TALIESIN: One pat of just (growling noise).

02:42:44.866 --> 02:42:48.313
MATT: There is a moment of transition. It's a
little awkward.

02:42:48.313 --> 02:42:54.775
TALIESIN: (yowling, then slurping)

02:42:54.775 --> 02:42:57.300
MATT: (sploosh) Into the ocean!

02:42:57.300 --> 02:42:59.537
TALIESIN: There you go, bud.

02:42:59.537 --> 02:43:02.536
MATT: (swishing) Below, disappearing into the
depths.

02:43:02.536 --> 02:43:06.542
MARISHA: Sorry. Go, Frumpkin, go!

02:43:06.542 --> 02:43:11.064
MATT: Go ahead and make a perception check for
Frumpkin.

02:43:11.064 --> 02:43:13.984
SAM and LAURA: Come on, Frumpkin.

02:43:13.984 --> 02:43:15.221
LIAM: Not good.

02:43:15.221 --> 02:43:16.944
LAURA: Ugh! It's never good!

02:43:16.944 --> 02:43:17.840
LIAM: Eight.

02:43:17.840 --> 02:43:23.780
MATT: From the upper tier of the water, Frumpkin
sees-- the water here is pretty clear.

02:43:23.780 --> 02:43:26.927
MARISHA: He made it worse. The water here is
pretty clear.

02:43:26.927 --> 02:43:34.126
MATT: Frumpkin is a bit distracted by the heavy
schools of fish that seem to be glittering beneath

02:43:34.126 --> 02:43:39.447
the surface and catching a little bit of the light
that's making its way through the waves and

02:43:39.447 --> 02:43:45.971
causing this array of sparkles roughly 30, 40, 50
feet below the surface.

02:43:45.971 --> 02:43:47.986
LIAM: I see a whole lot of ocean.

02:43:47.986 --> 02:43:52.852
MATT: Continues deeper, deeper. Make another
perception check.

02:43:52.852 --> 02:43:55.105
ASHLEY: Come on, Frumpkin.

02:43:55.105 --> 02:43:56.568
LIAM: 14.

02:43:56.568 --> 02:44:03.717
MATT: Okay. First thing Frumpkin notices is the
ocean here is not as deep as the Diver's Grave. It

02:44:03.717 --> 02:44:13.050
goes down maybe 300 feet. It's still deep, but
it's a third of the depth you ended up having to

02:44:13.050 --> 02:44:13.901
go down.

02:44:13.901 --> 02:44:18.234
LIAM: I'm going to send him in slowly larger
circles over time.

02:44:18.234 --> 02:44:30.280
MATT: Frumpkin does see a shape amongst the
clusters of seaweed and other bits of life that

02:44:30.280 --> 02:44:39.588
exist down there in natural ocean life. You can
see chunks of ocean rock and volcanic rock, things

02:44:39.588 --> 02:44:51.352
that may have been lobbed from ancient volcanic
detonations, and a tower; a sub-ocean tower that's

02:44:51.352 --> 02:45:00.887
leaning at an angle. You can see bits of broken
rock based around it, and the seaweed is cluttered

02:45:00.887 --> 02:45:02.612
up around the base of it.

02:45:02.612 --> 02:45:05.355
LIAM: Now are we talking architecture or natural?

02:45:05.355 --> 02:45:07.961
MATT: Architecture, constructed.

02:45:07.961 --> 02:45:09.472
LIAM: I relay this.

02:45:09.472 --> 02:45:17.322
MATT: The top of it is somewhat jagged; it has
sustained some erosion or damage towards its top,

02:45:17.322 --> 02:45:26.320
and it leads down inside. You can see shelves or
bits where there may have been stairs or levels,

02:45:26.320 --> 02:45:31.564
but most of that has fallen inward, and from
Frumpkin's exterior perspective, mostly hollow and

02:45:31.564 --> 02:45:38.160
disappearing into darkness the further in. With a
14, Frumpkin also notices a little bit of

02:45:38.160 --> 02:45:48.394
movement. Towards the very tops of the seaweed,
there are humanoid bodies that are tangled in the

02:45:48.394 --> 02:45:55.738
seaweed a bit that appear to be floating there,
and then one of them twitches and goes (moaning).

02:45:55.738 --> 02:45:57.589
SAM and LAURA: Oh, no.

02:45:57.589 --> 02:45:59.613
MARISHA: Why does this keep happening?

02:45:59.613 --> 02:46:02.257
LIAM: There's more dead things down below.

02:46:02.257 --> 02:46:02.988
TALIESIN: Oh, man.

02:46:02.988 --> 02:46:03.823
LAURA: Oh, no!

02:46:03.823 --> 02:46:05.197
SAM: Nopey nope!

02:46:05.197 --> 02:46:07.299
TRAVIS: Well, Caduceus, you're definitely coming.

02:46:07.299 --> 02:46:10.113
TALIESIN: Well, we may need a nap before we go
down there.

02:46:10.113 --> 02:46:10.860
TRAVIS: All right.

02:46:10.860 --> 02:46:12.702
LAURA: We did; we got a long rest.

02:46:12.702 --> 02:46:13.837
MARISHA: We just woke up.

02:46:13.837 --> 02:46:14.977
TALIESIN: But, since the Yasha thing?

02:46:14.977 --> 02:46:15.606
MATT: Yeah.

02:46:15.606 --> 02:46:17.005
LAURA: Yeah, we still got a long rest.

02:46:17.005 --> 02:46:22.124
TALIESIN: Oh, in that case, I'm going to manage my
spells then.

02:46:26.044 --> 02:46:28.466
MARISHA: Jagged tower seem familiar?

02:46:28.466 --> 02:46:30.085
TRAVIS: Yes.

02:46:30.085 --> 02:46:31.846
MARISHA: Okay.

02:46:31.846 --> 02:46:40.583
TRAVIS: One thing we should do: can I get you guys
to scurry up to the crow's nest one more time and

02:46:40.801 --> 02:46:44.008
give a gander for any ships?

02:46:44.008 --> 02:46:47.372
MARISHA: Me and Caduceus again?

02:46:47.372 --> 02:46:55.928
TRAVIS: Yeah. Look really carefully: coves,
inlets, anything that might look like it might be hiding.

02:46:55.928 --> 02:46:58.862
MARISHA: Want to do separate rolls this time?

02:46:58.862 --> 02:47:01.283
TALIESIN: Yeah, let's do it separately.

02:47:01.283 --> 02:47:03.769
MARISHA: Fucking horrible!

02:47:03.769 --> 02:47:05.511
TALIESIN: Oh my god!

02:47:05.511 --> 02:47:09.091
TRAVIS: Totally fine! We're safe!

02:47:09.091 --> 02:47:10.046
MARISHA: Eight.

02:47:10.046 --> 02:47:11.598
TALIESIN: Ten.

02:47:11.598 --> 02:47:13.022
MATT: Seems pretty clear.

02:47:13.022 --> 02:47:13.715
LAURA: Ugh!

02:47:13.715 --> 02:47:15.133
TALIESIN: Seems pretty clear.

02:47:15.133 --> 02:47:19.493
LIAM: That tower's familiar to you, huh?

02:47:19.493 --> 02:47:24.320
TRAVIS: No. It just seems like the obvious
entrance.

02:47:24.320 --> 02:47:26.861
LIAM: So you misspoke?

02:47:26.861 --> 02:47:28.278
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:47:28.278 --> 02:47:33.898
(background music)

02:47:33.898 --> 02:47:34.569
LIAM: Okay.

02:47:35.260 --> 02:47:45.727
TRAVIS: Sorry, my impulsiveness was starting to
catch up again. I just want to be honest. (sighs)

02:47:46.006 --> 02:47:52.713
Doesn't seem like there's a trap, Nott, right? We
seem to be by ourselves, at least up here.

02:47:52.713 --> 02:48:00.569
SAM: Yeah. Up here. Where there's no water. We're
totally fine. Down there, there's dead bodies on seaweed.

02:48:00.569 --> 02:48:05.753
(laughter)

02:48:05.753 --> 02:48:11.972
TRAVIS: Yeah, but I mean, what's a couple of dead
bodies on seaweed to people like us? No bigs, right?

02:48:11.972 --> 02:48:14.874
ASHLEY: Wait, they're already dead? They're
animated dead.

02:48:14.874 --> 02:48:16.708
MARISHA: They were like (menacing noises).

02:48:16.708 --> 02:48:21.650
MATT: Fumpkin didn't get a great look at them. It
was uncertain one or the other, but they appear to

02:48:21.650 --> 02:48:25.034
be humanoid and wrapped in seaweed, and then--

02:48:25.034 --> 02:48:26.715
LIAM: One of them seemed to spasm.

02:48:26.715 --> 02:48:30.425
MATT: One of them seemed to twitch and move for a
second before going back to rest.

02:48:30.425 --> 02:48:32.973
TRAVIS: About what time of the day is it right
now?

02:48:32.973 --> 02:48:37.508
MATT: At this point, it's early afternoon. Maybe
one or two hours after noon.

02:48:37.508 --> 02:48:39.306
TRAVIS: Let's get this thing done.

02:48:39.306 --> 02:48:45.922
MARISHA: Do you have the ability to let us breathe
under there?

02:48:45.922 --> 02:48:47.216
TRAVIS: I do.

02:48:47.216 --> 02:48:52.212
SAM: Yasha, how are you feeling?

02:48:52.212 --> 02:48:55.709
TRAVIS: Up for another scrap?

02:48:55.709 --> 02:49:04.975
ASHLEY: I love swimming. I like scrapping. So this
is a combo of the two of them, you know? I'm in.

02:49:08.765 --> 02:49:19.526
TRAVIS: All right. I'll look at the group and I
will cast Underwater Breathing on everyone for 24 hours.

02:49:20.345 --> 02:49:23.770
LAURA: Oh gosh.

02:49:23.770 --> 02:49:31.790
MATT: A familiar lightness in the lungs seems to
take root inside. The air tastes a little bit

02:49:32.034 --> 02:49:40.428
different once the incantation is complete. You
feel the familiar point of anxiety build in your

02:49:40.428 --> 02:49:42.757
chest since last time you dove.

02:49:42.757 --> 02:49:49.132
MARISHA: It's cold already. (groaning)

02:49:49.132 --> 02:49:58.718
SAM: I'm going to go find the other bottle of
mead. Drink until I am more than intoxicated--

02:49:58.718 --> 02:50:00.880
MARISHA: (yelling) That was for the crew!

02:50:00.880 --> 02:50:02.612
SAM: Fuck them!

02:50:02.612 --> 02:50:06.486
MARISHA: What?! Nott!

02:50:06.486 --> 02:50:08.362
SAM: I need this right now.

02:50:08.362 --> 02:50:10.799
MARISHA: Your flask is bottomless!

02:50:10.799 --> 02:50:19.161
SAM: I'm kind of sick of it; it's the same booze
over and over again. I'm sorry-- I love you baby,

02:50:19.409 --> 02:50:25.253
I love you, but it's getting to be a little bit--
ugh. It's like if you eat Rice Krispies every day--

02:50:25.253 --> 02:50:28.165
TALIESIN: Maybe if you washed it every now and
then it would have a slightly different--

02:50:28.165 --> 02:50:30.536
MARISHA: Do we see her go and sneak the mead?

02:50:30.536 --> 02:50:34.466
MATT: You see her leave for a bit, and then come
back with an empty bottle of mead.

02:50:34.466 --> 02:50:39.264
SAM: (slurring) Let's go swimming.

02:50:39.264 --> 02:50:45.505
TRAVIS: What's the distance from the middle of
this archipelago to the nearest outer island?

02:50:45.505 --> 02:50:53.046
MATT: About a quarter mile. A quarter mile to a
mile to the nearest one. Actually, it's probably a

02:50:53.046 --> 02:50:55.281
little more than that, a few miles.

02:50:55.281 --> 02:51:01.440
TRAVIS: I'll go to Orly and say: While we're
underneath, if you see another ship enter, or

02:51:01.440 --> 02:51:05.929
danger present itself, make for land and we'll
find you.

02:51:05.929 --> 02:51:12.009
MATT: "Understood." Yeah, it's about a mile to the
shore, looking at the map there.

02:51:12.009 --> 02:51:15.905
TALIESIN: I'll leave my tea kettle on board.
Should be fine, we'll find them.

02:51:15.905 --> 02:51:17.778
TRAVIS: You ready?

02:51:17.778 --> 02:51:22.010
SAM: Before we go, I'm going to pull Caleb aside.

02:51:22.010 --> 02:51:25.093
TALIESIN: We're all going to stare at you while
you do this.

02:51:25.093 --> 02:51:34.644
SAM: Hey, while we're down there, if Fjord tries
to be, like, bad, can you restrain him? Like if

02:51:34.644 --> 02:51:40.083
something overcomes him with evil, can you fuck
him up?

02:51:40.083 --> 02:51:41.965
LIAM: Most likely, yeah.

02:51:41.965 --> 02:51:46.678
SAM: I would be ready to. I feel like 50-50 he's
turning evil on us.

02:51:46.678 --> 02:51:49.816
LIAM: Will you stay close to me down there,
please?

02:51:49.816 --> 02:51:54.609
SAM: Of course I will, I'm not going to leave you.
You're puny and weak! I'm sorry.

02:51:54.609 --> 02:51:58.731
(laughter)

02:51:58.731 --> 02:52:04.733
SAM: I meant physically. Physically, you're puny
and weak. Intellectually, you're a rock star,

02:52:04.733 --> 02:52:07.985
you're amazing. You know I respect you!

02:52:07.985 --> 02:52:11.311
LIAM: Your first statement was accurate.

02:52:11.311 --> 02:52:18.016
SAM: By the way, what did we get? The books? Did
we get any good spells?

02:52:18.016 --> 02:52:19.937
LIAM: Yeah.

02:52:19.937 --> 02:52:21.374
SAM: Tell me!

02:52:21.374 --> 02:52:26.813
LIAM: There was a jar full of-- they're like boba.
It's food.

02:52:26.813 --> 02:52:28.703
SAM: Tapioca, yeah.

02:52:28.703 --> 02:52:30.882
LIAM: It lasts a long time.

02:52:30.882 --> 02:52:32.552
SAM: It's just food?

02:52:32.552 --> 02:52:33.456
LIAM: Yeah.

02:52:33.456 --> 02:52:35.324
SAM: Okay. Any sort of--?

02:52:35.324 --> 02:52:39.193
LIAM: The ink is good; it will help me in my
studies.

02:52:39.193 --> 02:52:42.799
SAM: And the books, any powerful spells? Anything
that can--?

02:52:42.799 --> 02:52:48.607
LIAM: One of the books was about debate. One was a
spell book.

02:52:48.607 --> 02:52:50.473
SAM: And?

02:52:50.473 --> 02:52:53.709
LIAM: And there's useful things in it.

02:52:53.709 --> 02:52:57.309
SAM: Reality shifting things?

02:52:57.309 --> 02:53:03.554
LIAM: A little, yeah.

02:53:03.554 --> 02:53:11.139
SAM: Excellent. I give him a big kiss on his
cheek, and it's real smelly. Me, not him.

02:53:11.139 --> 02:53:12.332
MATT: Well...

02:53:12.332 --> 02:53:13.747
SAM: Both.

02:53:13.747 --> 02:53:17.001
TALIESIN: The book was about debate and then you
were going to argue about--

02:53:17.001 --> 02:53:21.883
LIAM: I pull her even a little further away and
turn our backs to the group and--

02:53:21.883 --> 02:53:24.157
LAURA: We're all watching you.

02:53:24.157 --> 02:53:32.625
LIAM: That's fine. I've been getting a little
wrapped up in this team; we're working as a team,

02:53:32.625 --> 02:53:39.836
and I've forgotten you and me. I've forgotten.

02:53:39.836 --> 02:53:43.255
SAM: Well, don't! We're in this together.

02:53:43.255 --> 02:53:44.672
LIAM: Yeah.

02:53:44.672 --> 02:53:50.043
SAM: Don't forget me. I won't forget you.

02:53:52.403 --> 02:53:54.100
LIAM: Stay close.

02:53:54.130 --> 02:53:58.810
SAM: Always. All right, fuckers, let's go!

02:53:58.810 --> 02:54:03.403
TRAVIS: When we get under, make sure to take a
breath really quick; you'll sink faster.

02:54:03.792 --> 02:54:04.877
SAM: Oh, yeah.

02:54:04.877 --> 02:54:10.826
MARISHA: If Uk'otoa decides to show up--

02:54:10.826 --> 02:54:12.508
TRAVIS: He won't.

02:54:12.508 --> 02:54:14.756
LAURA: But if he does--

02:54:14.756 --> 02:54:17.287
MARISHA: What's the plan?

02:54:17.287 --> 02:54:19.371
TRAVIS: He won't.

02:54:19.371 --> 02:54:22.399
MARISHA: (doubtfully) Okay.

02:54:22.399 --> 02:54:27.102
LIAM: Caleb is standing behind Beauregard and
sliding his octopus onto his head.

02:54:27.102 --> 02:54:29.152
MARISHA: Still cool.

02:54:29.152 --> 02:54:30.437
LAURA: Looking good.

02:54:30.437 --> 02:54:32.163
TALIESIN: It's a look.

02:54:32.163 --> 02:54:33.397
MARISHA: All right.

02:54:33.397 --> 02:54:36.649
TRAVIS: (heavy footsteps, splash)

02:54:36.649 --> 02:54:37.974
TALIESIN: No fear.

02:54:37.974 --> 02:54:39.975
MARISHA: SEALs dive!

02:54:39.975 --> 02:54:47.783
MATT: One by one, you all make your way into the
ocean. (splashing) The water is cold, but you

02:54:47.783 --> 02:54:55.777
adjust and begin to find your way down. Are we
swimming stealthily, or are we brazenly heading

02:54:55.777 --> 02:54:56.929
towards this temple?

02:54:56.929 --> 02:54:58.401
LIAM: Always stealthily.

02:54:58.401 --> 02:54:59.127
LAURA: Stealth.

02:54:59.127 --> 02:55:01.367
MATT: All right, so we're stealth missioning in. I
need everybody to go ahead and make a stealth

02:55:01.367 --> 02:55:02.965
check, please.

02:55:02.965 --> 02:55:08.199
LAURA: Natural 20! Straight up, light up.

02:55:08.472 --> 02:55:10.301
LIAM: Is anybody putting some juice on this? No?
Straight roll?

02:55:10.301 --> 02:55:11.561
TALIESIN: No, straight roll.

02:55:11.561 --> 02:55:13.610
LAURA: Oh, I'll give you a Blessing of the
Trickster.

02:55:13.610 --> 02:55:15.370
LIAM: Thanks. That's plus ten?

02:55:15.370 --> 02:55:16.065
TRAVIS: 13.

02:55:16.065 --> 02:55:17.242
LAURA: That's advantage.

02:55:17.242 --> 02:55:18.016
LIAM: Advantage.

02:55:18.016 --> 02:55:18.640
MARISHA: 12.

02:55:18.640 --> 02:55:22.671
LIAM: Oh, they're both good. Now even better. 20.

02:55:22.671 --> 02:55:23.904
SAM: 23.

02:55:23.904 --> 02:55:26.004
LAURA: Natural 20.

02:55:26.004 --> 02:55:27.132
TALIESIN: Six!

02:55:27.132 --> 02:55:28.285
ASHLEY: 14.

02:55:28.285 --> 02:55:29.874
MATT: Okay.

02:55:29.874 --> 02:55:32.606
MARISHA: Super middle of the road.

02:55:32.606 --> 02:55:41.685
MATT: You're moving at a slower speed, swimming
below, trying to be as stealthy as you can. Making

02:55:41.685 --> 02:55:48.167
your way further down, the filtering light grows
dimmer and dimmer--

02:55:48.167 --> 02:55:52.476
LAURA: Oh, I left the weasel on the ship again. I
didn't bring him with me.

02:55:52.476 --> 02:55:55.320
MATT: There's a certain point where I assume
you're not trying to kill your weasel.

02:55:55.320 --> 02:55:56.882
LAURA: Yeah, I'm not going to kill my weasel.

02:55:56.882 --> 02:55:59.773
MATT: I fucked with you for a few weeks when you
were new to pet ownership, but then after a few

02:55:59.773 --> 02:56:11.924
close calls, I figured-- The deeper it goes, the
harder it is to see, the colder it is-- a familiar sensation.

02:56:12.822 --> 02:56:15.342
MARISHA: Is it as dark as it was before? Equally?

02:56:15.342 --> 02:56:16.986
TRAVIS: It's clear water.

02:56:16.986 --> 02:56:26.076
MATT: It's clear water, so the light does carry
further, and you guys aren't going as deep. You do

02:56:26.076 --> 02:56:31.406
manage to make out, as you get further and further
down, the general shape of the tower within sight.

02:56:31.406 --> 02:56:37.119
It is comparatively murky because of the lack of
light, but you can see the shape. You can also,

02:56:37.119 --> 02:56:42.178
based on the warning that Caleb had given, see
some of the figures. You see about five of them,

02:56:42.178 --> 02:56:50.792
all tangled or wrapped in threads of this seaweed.
Regular seaweed, not the strange crimson type that

02:56:50.792 --> 02:56:52.443
you came across in the Diver's Grave.

02:56:52.443 --> 02:56:59.035
TALIESIN: I'm going to do a little ping of Eyes of
the Grave, just to make sure there's no more of

02:56:59.035 --> 02:57:00.743
them in this other than the ones we can see.

02:57:00.743 --> 02:57:02.719
MATT: What's the range on that?

02:57:02.719 --> 02:57:03.531
TALIESIN: 60 feet.

02:57:03.531 --> 02:57:06.379
MATT: All right. You're going to have to get
pretty close to try it.

02:57:06.379 --> 02:57:12.120
TALIESIN: I know that we're heading-- once I feel
like, or maybe I should hit it again--

02:57:12.120 --> 02:57:22.612
MATT: Okay, as you swim down to get within range
to use your Eyes of the Grave, thankfully, the

02:57:22.612 --> 02:57:31.087
nearest creature doesn't seem to notice your
approach. It is not undead. Make a perception check.

02:57:34.747 --> 02:57:37.060
TALIESIN: Come on. Ah, better. 20.

02:57:37.060 --> 02:57:44.417
MATT: Actually, roll at disadvantage because you
don't have darkvision, unfortunately, and you're

02:57:44.417 --> 02:57:47.322
low enough now where the light is limited.

02:57:47.322 --> 02:57:48.759
TALIESIN: 16.

02:57:48.759 --> 02:57:56.011
MATT: 16's still okay. Now that you have a better
look at it, at a closer perspective, the humanoid

02:57:56.011 --> 02:58:04.757
creature-- no clothing. It is thin. The limbs are
a little stretched, but there are tiny fins at the

02:58:04.757 --> 02:58:14.326
edge of the arms. Along the sides of the head,
there are gills. It has a strange glance, looking

02:58:14.326 --> 02:58:20.646
around like a sentry, almost. It's not undead. It
appears to be more of a fish person.

02:58:20.646 --> 02:58:23.661
TRAVIS: Does it look like it has four appendages?

02:58:23.661 --> 02:58:25.708
MATT: It has four appendages. It has arms and
legs.

02:58:25.708 --> 02:58:30.706
TALIESIN: Yeah. I would have gotten an undead ping
from any of them. I didn't get an undead ping?

02:58:30.706 --> 02:58:36.592
MATT: Nope. What's interesting is that one of its
lower appendages, its right leg, as you're

02:58:36.592 --> 02:58:45.168
watching, curls up and then unfurls. One of its
legs seems to move similarly to one of the

02:58:45.168 --> 02:58:46.797
appendages of Frumpkin.

02:58:46.797 --> 02:58:50.696
TRAVIS: Oh no.

02:58:50.696 --> 02:58:53.616
MATT: Just one. The others appear to be human.

02:58:53.616 --> 02:58:56.330
SAM: One person or one limb?

02:58:56.330 --> 02:58:57.395
MATT: One limb.

02:58:57.395 --> 02:58:59.143
LAURA: It's like the snake people on the other
island.

02:58:59.143 --> 02:59:01.494
MARISHA: That's some Cthulhuian shit.

02:59:01.494 --> 02:59:03.742
SAM: They all have one octopus tentacle?

02:59:03.742 --> 02:59:07.538
MATT: Well, the nearest one you saw has. You
aren't close enough to the others to make out what

02:59:07.538 --> 02:59:09.393
their physical representation is.

02:59:09.393 --> 02:59:13.455
TALIESIN: I'm relaying that to everybody very
quietly.

02:59:13.455 --> 02:59:15.271
LAURA: Where do we go, Fjord?

02:59:15.271 --> 02:59:19.692
MATT: You have five here that are watching. You
have to decide, what is it going to be? Is it a

02:59:19.692 --> 02:59:24.093
brazen attack? Is it some form of a stealth
mission? What are you doing?

02:59:24.093 --> 02:59:26.825
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Quietly.

02:59:26.825 --> 02:59:29.524
ASHLEY: That's a good idea.

02:59:29.524 --> 02:59:31.949
SAM: Should we make a distraction or anything?

02:59:31.949 --> 02:59:36.074
MATT: They're clustered enough around where
they're not going to not see you. You have nothing

02:59:36.074 --> 02:59:37.275
you're hiding behind.

02:59:37.275 --> 02:59:39.435
TRAVIS: We can't HALO drop in this bitch?

02:59:39.435 --> 02:59:43.126
MATT: No, a stealth mission in this would be
invisibility. You would have to do something where

02:59:43.126 --> 02:59:45.835
they cannot see you. Otherwise, they're going to
see you.

02:59:45.835 --> 02:59:48.756
MARISHA: Quick and fast?

02:59:48.756 --> 02:59:50.970
TRAVIS: Yeah, we can pair up.

02:59:50.970 --> 02:59:54.431
MARISHA and SAM: Buddy system.

02:59:54.431 --> 02:59:59.708
LAURA: I say we all attack each one until each one
is dead. We don't spread it out too much.

02:59:59.708 --> 03:00:01.246
SAM: One at a time?

03:00:01.246 --> 03:00:02.717
LAURA: Focus on--

03:00:02.717 --> 03:00:04.368
MARISHA: The people?

03:00:04.368 --> 03:00:06.280
LAURA: Yeah.

03:00:06.280 --> 03:00:08.575
TRAVIS: Or at least two. There's five.

03:00:08.575 --> 03:00:10.769
MARISHA: Are they for sure going to attack us?

03:00:10.769 --> 03:00:14.095
TRAVIS: Pretty sure. They look like they're on the
look, yeah.

03:00:14.095 --> 03:00:18.875
MARISHA: Bad? Super bad? There are five?

03:00:18.875 --> 03:00:26.328
LAURA: Yeah. I could Invoke Duplicity down there
and see if they attack us. If they do, then we can

03:00:26.328 --> 03:00:27.936
attack them.

03:00:27.936 --> 03:00:31.629
TALIESIN: It looks dangerous. I think it's
worth--

03:00:31.629 --> 03:00:34.077
LAURA: Just going for it?

03:00:34.077 --> 03:00:38.736
TRAVIS: Who's got a good range? Who's got some
good pop on a good range? You?

03:00:38.736 --> 03:00:41.123
LIAM: Well, I can hit for sure, but--

03:00:41.123 --> 03:00:43.325
TRAVIS: Does the water do anything to it?

03:00:43.325 --> 03:00:44.022
LIAM: No.

03:00:44.022 --> 03:00:45.639
LAURA: How spread out are they?

03:00:45.639 --> 03:00:50.230
MATT: I mean, they're not a perfect ring of five
around the top. They're all hanging right towards

03:00:50.230 --> 03:00:57.259
the top of the tower from the different layers of
seaweed. They're anywhere from 15 to 20 feet from

03:00:57.259 --> 03:01:03.854
each other. Their arrangement is a bit uneven.

03:01:03.854 --> 03:01:07.654
LIAM: They're wrapped up in the seaweed?

03:01:07.654 --> 03:01:08.486
MATT: Mm-hmm.

03:01:08.486 --> 03:01:14.136
LIAM: Are we sure we want to make a hit on these
things that are tangled up, as opposed to this one

03:01:14.136 --> 03:01:16.035
that is free floating?

03:01:16.035 --> 03:01:18.074
TRAVIS: There is one that is free?

03:01:18.074 --> 03:01:24.588
MATT: Looking at them all, it looks like they're
less wrapped and tangled and more like they have

03:01:24.588 --> 03:01:29.862
an arm or a leg that they've curled around it and
are anchoring themselves to it.

03:01:29.862 --> 03:01:31.814
MARISHA: Like seahorses.

03:01:31.814 --> 03:01:33.050
MATT: Kind of.

03:01:33.050 --> 03:01:35.891
TRAVIS: How close do you need to be, Caleb?

03:01:35.891 --> 03:01:37.918
LIAM: Not that close.

03:01:37.918 --> 03:01:44.171
TRAVIS: I'm more of a fan of them coming to us,
frankly.

03:01:44.171 --> 03:01:46.835
LIAM: Little over a hundred feet away.

03:01:46.835 --> 03:01:51.760
TRAVIS: Let's get in range of whatever Caleb needs
to do, and then let's break off into three and four.

03:01:52.212 --> 03:01:54.505
SAM: We're not on the floor of the sea? We're
above them?

03:01:54.505 --> 03:01:56.323
MATT: You're above them.

03:01:56.323 --> 03:01:58.980
TRAVIS: They can pick, but they've got to come to
us.

03:01:58.980 --> 03:02:02.211
LIAM: Well, you tell me. As far as I'm concerned,
you're calling the shots here.

03:02:02.211 --> 03:02:09.409
TRAVIS: Let's get within whatever you need. 120
feet? 100 feet? We'll try to stealth within that range.

03:02:09.409 --> 03:02:17.664
MATT: Okay. Caduceus has made that journey. As you
continue to push in that direction, you get to the

03:02:17.664 --> 03:02:26.326
exterior of that range. They seem to have not
noticed your presence, yet.

03:02:26.326 --> 03:02:35.717
TRAVIS: Spread out. 30 feet between us, the two
groups. Clerics with each group.

03:02:36.777 --> 03:02:39.180
TALIESIN: I'll stick with you.

03:02:39.908 --> 03:02:42.372
MARISHA: I will not go with Yasha because Sentinel
and Sentinel.

03:02:42.372 --> 03:02:43.978
LAURA: I'll go with Beau.

03:02:43.978 --> 03:02:47.547
SAM: How about we four and the outside three?

03:02:47.547 --> 03:02:48.333
MARISHA: Okay.

03:02:51.273 --> 03:02:58.395
LIAM: I could either focus what I'm going to do on
one of them, or I could tickle all of them.

03:03:00.683 --> 03:03:02.260
TRAVIS: All of them at the same time?

03:03:02.260 --> 03:03:05.698
LIAM: It would just get their attention. It would
not solve anything.

03:03:05.698 --> 03:03:08.539
TRAVIS: Wizard's choice. How about just one, and
you pick?

03:03:08.539 --> 03:03:17.101
LIAM: Okay. Well, I will aim for the one closest.
I begin to weave my hands underwater and cast

03:03:17.101 --> 03:03:18.192
Magic Missile.

03:03:18.192 --> 03:03:21.712
SAM: I will simultaneously fire a crossbow bolt.

03:03:21.712 --> 03:03:25.966
TALIESIN: Just for fun, I'll add into this with a
Sacred Flame.

03:03:25.966 --> 03:03:28.313
MATT: All towards the same target?

03:03:28.313 --> 03:03:29.560
LAURA: Yeah.

03:03:29.560 --> 03:03:32.322
TRAVIS: I'll also send Eldritch Blast.

03:03:32.322 --> 03:03:35.007
TALIESIN: See if we can knock one out.

03:03:35.007 --> 03:03:37.687
LIAM: I'm casting at 2nd-level.

03:03:37.687 --> 03:03:43.706
MATT: Okay. Those that need to roll attacks, roll
attacks. Those that need to roll damage, roll damage.

03:03:45.612 --> 03:03:48.350
TALIESIN: Mine is a save against dex of 16.

03:03:48.350 --> 03:03:50.840
MATT: Nope!

03:03:50.840 --> 03:03:54.815
LAURA: Mine is also a save against dex of 15.

03:03:54.815 --> 03:03:56.311
MATT: Natural 20.

03:03:56.311 --> 03:03:58.230
TRAVIS: 26 and a 19.

03:03:58.230 --> 03:04:00.272
MATT: Both hit.

03:04:00.272 --> 03:04:01.628
SAM: 12 to hit.

03:04:01.628 --> 03:04:03.559
MATT: 12 to hit? Hits.

03:04:03.559 --> 03:04:09.169
TRAVIS: 21 points of Eldritch Blast.

03:04:09.169 --> 03:04:13.146
TALIESIN: 11 points of radiant damage.

03:04:13.146 --> 03:04:16.839
LIAM: Four beads of energy. Nine-- nein points
of damage.

03:04:16.839 --> 03:04:20.751
SAM: Another 20 points of damage.

03:04:20.751 --> 03:04:24.010
LIAM: Oh, 13, excuse me.

03:04:24.010 --> 03:04:35.385
MATT: This entity, breathing under the water,
watches this glimmer of arcane energy. Its

03:04:35.385 --> 03:04:43.113
attention turns up towards it as it releases the
seaweed. Then (multiple explosions), and goes limp

03:04:43.113 --> 03:04:48.211
under the water as a small cloud of its own blood
begins to fill the space around it. At which

03:04:48.211 --> 03:04:53.779
point, the other four look up and notice your
presence from the lights that have been glowing

03:04:53.779 --> 03:04:55.954
and the death of one of its comrades.

03:04:55.954 --> 03:04:57.686
MARISHA: Next target, maybe?

03:04:57.686 --> 03:05:00.148
MATT: Roll initiative.

03:05:00.148 --> 03:05:03.242
MARISHA: Natural one.

03:05:03.242 --> 03:05:07.903
MATT: Ooh, not good. Well, not good for them,
either. 25 to 20?

03:05:07.903 --> 03:05:10.992
TALIESIN: Is that with advantage? Oh.

03:05:10.992 --> 03:05:12.696
ASHLEY: Yeah. That first one was good.

03:05:12.696 --> 03:05:14.131
TRAVIS: 25 to 20?

03:05:14.131 --> 03:05:15.336
TALIESIN: Cricket.

03:05:15.336 --> 03:05:16.799
MATT: 20 to 15?

03:05:16.799 --> 03:05:18.516
LIAM and LAURA: 18. Hey!

03:05:18.516 --> 03:05:20.033
ASHLEY: 17.

03:05:20.033 --> 03:05:23.742
SAM: 17! Who are you?

03:05:23.742 --> 03:05:25.060
ASHLEY: Who is this?

03:05:25.060 --> 03:05:28.613
MATT: All right, that's Yasha. 15 to ten?

03:05:28.613 --> 03:05:30.004
TALIESIN: 13.

03:05:30.004 --> 03:05:31.381
SAM: 11.

03:05:31.381 --> 03:05:33.308
ASHLEY: I have to be close.

03:05:33.308 --> 03:05:36.293
TALIESIN: Can you get down there and hold an
action?

03:05:36.293 --> 03:05:40.037
MATT: Your movement is halved when you're
swimming, except for Fjord.

03:05:40.037 --> 03:05:41.258
ASHLEY: Say again?

03:05:41.258 --> 03:05:44.531
MATT: Your movement is halved while you're
swimming, just so you know. You guys are about a

03:05:44.531 --> 03:05:48.780
hundred feet away, so it's going to take a little
bit to get there for the melee folk.

03:05:48.780 --> 03:05:50.028
TRAVIS: Two. One.

03:05:50.028 --> 03:05:53.130
MARISHA: Yeah. Five total for me.

03:05:53.130 --> 03:05:54.711
TRAVIS: Oh, well then, you top me.

03:05:54.711 --> 03:05:57.688
MARISHA: Dude, what? You rolled a two?

03:05:57.688 --> 03:05:59.681
TRAVIS: Yeah. Plus zero.

03:05:59.681 --> 03:06:06.019
MATT: Caleb, you're up first. Caleb and Jester,
the four of them now begin to quickly swim up in

03:06:06.019 --> 03:06:11.289
your direction. They swim fast. They swim faster
than you do, at the very least.

03:06:11.289 --> 03:06:12.537
MARISHA: Well, that makes sense.

03:06:12.537 --> 03:06:14.044
MATT: About as fast as Fjord does.

03:06:14.044 --> 03:06:14.769
TRAVIS: 30 feet?

03:06:14.769 --> 03:06:19.577
MATT: Yep. You can see their webbed fingers and
the spines and the scales of their arms and legs.

03:06:19.577 --> 03:06:26.121
They look like the Creature from the Black Lagoon,
with a little bit of a slight more humanoid nose

03:06:26.121 --> 03:06:31.796
and mouth. They're now clambering up towards you
in the water. What are you guys doing?

03:06:31.796 --> 03:06:35.750
LAURA: Guiding Bolt at the one coming closest.

03:06:35.750 --> 03:06:38.238
MATT: Okay. Same one, or different target?

03:06:38.238 --> 03:06:45.136
LIAM: No, I'm nibbling on some licorice root, and
casting Haste on Fjord, and backing away.

03:06:45.136 --> 03:06:47.746
SAM: Haste on Fjord? Oh my god.

03:06:47.746 --> 03:06:48.965
TRAVIS: Whoa.

03:06:48.965 --> 03:06:54.062
MATT: It rolled a natural 20 again on its saving
throw! Two natural 20s in a row. Oh no, this is

03:06:54.062 --> 03:06:58.502
Guiding Bolt, never mind. He doesn't roll
anything. Wasted natural 20, Matt. Well done! It's

03:06:58.502 --> 03:07:00.238
okay. Roll your attack.

03:07:00.238 --> 03:07:03.824
TALIESIN: Well done. You've already helped.

03:07:03.824 --> 03:07:04.493
LAURA: 14?

03:07:04.493 --> 03:07:08.706
MATT: 14? Yeah, that hits. Their armor class is
11.

03:07:08.706 --> 03:07:15.255
TALIESIN: Whoa, good to know. Very low armor
class, easy to hit, which is usually dangerous.

03:07:15.255 --> 03:07:17.337
They're going to be trouble when they get in
there.

03:07:17.337 --> 03:07:21.534
LAURA: Okay, 14 points of radiant damage.

03:07:21.534 --> 03:07:28.579
MATT: 14 points of radiant damage. It bursts and
glows underneath. It's still alive. You see the

03:07:28.579 --> 03:07:31.902
blood splatter, and it has this glowing energy
surrounding its torso, making it easy to see in

03:07:31.902 --> 03:07:36.987
the dark depths below. Awesome, that finished your
turn. You cast Haste. That ends your guys' round,

03:07:36.987 --> 03:07:39.566
and you're backing away. Yasha, your turn.

03:07:39.566 --> 03:07:42.043
ASHLEY: I am going to move as much as I can,
getting closer to them.

03:07:42.043 --> 03:07:46.648
MATT: Okay, so movement of 15 feet. Dash 15 feet.
That'd be your full round there. Get you 30 feet

03:07:46.648 --> 03:07:53.894
down, so you're about 60 or so-- well no, your
movement speed is 40, so it's 20, 20. Yeah, you're

03:07:53.894 --> 03:07:55.296
about 60 feet away.

03:07:55.296 --> 03:07:56.975
TALIESIN: Do you want to have an action held,
though?

03:07:56.975 --> 03:08:02.321
ASHLEY: Yeah. I'm going to hold my action until
one of them either-- yeah, they get close to me.

03:08:02.321 --> 03:08:06.126
MATT: You'll only move 20 feet, then, so you're 80
feet away. Got it, okay. You're holding your

03:08:06.126 --> 03:08:10.116
action to hit whenever it comes close. All right,
that finishes your turn. Caduceus, you're up.

03:08:10.116 --> 03:08:19.512
TALIESIN: I'm going to move just behind Yasha. Are
any of them within range at this point?

03:08:19.512 --> 03:08:20.691
MATT: What range?

03:08:20.691 --> 03:08:22.702
TALIESIN: 30 or 60.

03:08:22.702 --> 03:08:25.890
MATT: No. They're about a hundred feet away. They
haven't taken their turn yet.

03:08:25.890 --> 03:08:29.335
TALIESIN: Then I'm going to hold a spell until
they're within range.

03:08:29.335 --> 03:08:31.239
MATT: What spell are you holding?

03:08:31.239 --> 03:08:33.595
TALIESIN: I'm going to hold Bane.

03:08:33.595 --> 03:08:36.203
MATT: Okay. Finishes your go. Nott, you're up.

03:08:36.203 --> 03:08:41.524
SAM: Oh, me? I'm going to swim-- well, no. I have
ranged attacks, so I'm going to just pick one, the

03:08:41.524 --> 03:08:43.505
one that Jester missed.

03:08:43.505 --> 03:08:45.960
MATT: What's your interior range with your
weapon?

03:08:45.960 --> 03:08:52.933
SAM: Oh, 30. No, I've been rolling at disadvantage
for-- it's 30 or 120 from the Tinkertop

03:08:52.933 --> 03:09:00.011
Boltblaster. I rolled at disadvantage last time.

03:09:00.011 --> 03:09:01.338
TALIESIN: Underwater?

03:09:01.338 --> 03:09:03.841
LAURA: No, because a crossbow you don't roll at
disadvantage.

03:09:03.841 --> 03:09:05.570
SAM: It's ranged disadvantage.

03:09:05.570 --> 03:09:12.508
MATT: Correct. Automatically misses a target
beyond the weapon's normal range. You don't roll

03:09:12.508 --> 03:09:17.376
disadvantage for the first half, the first 30
feet, but anything beyond 30 feet is an automatic

03:09:17.376 --> 03:09:20.744
miss because at that point it loses momentum and
can't keep traveling.

03:09:20.744 --> 03:09:24.288
SAM: Oh, underwater? Oh! I did not know that.

03:09:24.288 --> 03:09:26.096
MATT: Which you just learned.

03:09:26.096 --> 03:09:28.056
SAM: Oh. Well then, I didn't hit the first one.

03:09:28.056 --> 03:09:32.094
MATT: You didn't need to. You guys fucking
destroyed it. Before it came to you, it was

03:09:32.094 --> 03:09:32.874
already dead.

03:09:32.874 --> 03:09:35.103
SAM: It has to be within 30 underwater to hit?

03:09:35.103 --> 03:09:36.332
MATT: You've learned.

03:09:36.332 --> 03:09:38.191
SAM: I still do disadvantage.

03:09:38.191 --> 03:09:40.559
MATT: No, you do not roll disadvantage if it's
ranged.

03:09:40.559 --> 03:09:42.992
SAM: Okay, got it. I fire and nothing happens.

03:09:42.992 --> 03:09:45.764
MATT: It goes (shearing) and just floats.

03:09:45.764 --> 03:09:48.271
SAM: Oh, shit. I'll start going towards it.

03:09:48.271 --> 03:09:52.071
MATT: Okay, so you swim 15 feet. You can bonus
action dash if you want.

03:09:52.071 --> 03:09:54.921
SAM: Yes, I will bonus action dash to make it 30
feet.

03:09:54.921 --> 03:10:01.153
MATT: 30 feet in, that gets there. Now it's their
turn. They all double-move 60 feet as they swim

03:10:01.153 --> 03:10:06.923
upwards, getting as close as they can. That
definitely gets them in range for your spell.

03:10:06.923 --> 03:10:09.062
TALIESIN: I'm going to hit three of them with
Bane.

03:10:09.062 --> 03:10:12.740
MATT: You were 80 feet, so no one gets into range
with you. So Bane. You're hitting three of them

03:10:12.740 --> 03:10:13.536
with Bane.

03:10:13.536 --> 03:10:15.974
TALIESIN: Three of them with Bane. It's a charisma
saving throw.

03:10:15.974 --> 03:10:18.815
MATT: Okay, there's three of them that have not
been hit. There's one that has.

03:10:18.815 --> 03:10:20.803
TALIESIN: I'm hitting the ones that have not been
hit.

03:10:20.803 --> 03:10:22.588
MATT: Got it, all right. Saving throw is wisdom?

03:10:22.588 --> 03:10:23.423
TALIESIN: Charisma.

03:10:23.423 --> 03:10:27.615
MATT: Sorry, charisma. Ooh, minus one for them.
Fail, fail, and fail!

03:10:27.615 --> 03:10:29.686
ASHLEY: Wait, they were 80 feet away?

03:10:29.686 --> 03:10:31.871
MATT: They were 80 feet away from you, and they
just moved 60 feet. There's 20 feet between the

03:10:31.871 --> 03:10:33.319
two of you now.

03:10:33.319 --> 03:10:36.633
ASHLEY: Oh, from where I had gotten to with the 20
feet. Got it.

03:10:36.633 --> 03:10:40.696
MATT: All three of them fail. All three of them
are Baned.

03:10:40.696 --> 03:10:43.827
TALIESIN: Yeah. Attacks and savings throws, 1d4.

03:10:43.827 --> 03:10:46.093
MATT: Got it. Beau, you're up.

03:10:46.093 --> 03:10:48.123
MARISHA: Oh, shit. Anyone in range?

03:10:48.123 --> 03:10:50.276
MATT: They're about 40 feet from you.

03:10:50.276 --> 03:10:55.290
MARISHA: Oh! Yeah, I'll swim-- which one is
closest? All of them? All four of them?

03:10:55.290 --> 03:10:58.831
LAURA: I've hit one of them with Guiding Bolt, and
you have advantage against it.

03:10:58.831 --> 03:11:00.655
MARISHA: I'll take that one. I'll swim.

03:11:00.655 --> 03:11:03.072
MATT: You move towards the one that is glowing.
You swim down. That's 20 feet, so you're still 20

03:11:03.072 --> 03:11:03.870
feet away.

03:11:03.870 --> 03:11:06.093
TRAVIS: Is it just hers at advantage, or all
attacks against it?

03:11:06.093 --> 03:11:07.806
TALIESIN: Just the first one.

03:11:07.806 --> 03:11:11.007
MARISHA: I will spend a ki point to do Swim of the
Wind.

03:11:11.007 --> 03:11:14.446
MATT: That's the additional 20 feet. That will get
you right into range of the one Jester hit. It's

03:11:14.446 --> 03:11:17.787
like (snarling). As you get really up close to it
now, with the glowing light around it, you get a

03:11:17.787 --> 03:11:23.586
good look at its face. It's covered in layers of
scales and spined points that come out at various

03:11:23.586 --> 03:11:30.801
points of its facial features. Its eyes are yellow
and a sick little side lens that closes.

03:11:30.801 --> 03:11:32.798
LAURA: Ew. X-Files.

03:11:32.798 --> 03:11:36.167
MARISHA: Punch. Jesus Christ.

03:11:36.167 --> 03:11:37.716
MATT: You have advantage because of the Guiding
Bolt.

03:11:37.716 --> 03:11:40.897
MARISHA: Right, thank you, Jester! Ooh, that's
much better. 18?

03:11:40.897 --> 03:11:42.632
MATT: 18 hits.

03:11:42.632 --> 03:11:46.792
MARISHA: I'll use my fist.

03:11:46.792 --> 03:11:52.371
MATT: Oh, but you do have disadvantage underwater
with melee attacks, however. So it cancels out.

03:11:52.371 --> 03:11:54.118
What was your first roll?

03:11:54.118 --> 03:11:56.698
MARISHA: It was a three plus seven, so ten?

03:11:56.698 --> 03:12:00.354
MATT: Ten misses. That first strike just-- it's
too slow.

03:12:00.354 --> 03:12:08.156
MARISHA: Second attack. Almost a natural 20, but
it wasn't. 13?

03:12:08.156 --> 03:12:09.079
MATT: 13 hits.

03:12:09.079 --> 03:12:10.566
MARISHA: Oh, that's fun!

03:12:10.566 --> 03:12:13.468
LAURA: Would it still be at disadvantage, though,
on the second attack?

03:12:13.468 --> 03:12:15.377
MATT: It would be.

03:12:15.377 --> 03:12:19.981
MARISHA: Fuck, balls, shit, cock. Still hits.

03:12:19.981 --> 03:12:22.425
LAURA: That's my favorite combo.

03:12:22.425 --> 03:12:24.725
MARISHA: Five damage.

03:12:24.725 --> 03:12:31.498
MATT: Five damage. It's hurt, but it's still
going. That's the end of your turn, Beau?

03:12:31.498 --> 03:12:33.321
MARISHA: Yep.

03:12:33.321 --> 03:12:38.116
MATT: Fjord, you're up. Your speed is 60
underwater, so you can go to any of them.

03:12:38.116 --> 03:12:43.521
TRAVIS: I will join Beau, just in case someone
decides to fuck around.

03:12:43.521 --> 03:12:47.097
MATT: You Aquaman it through the water towards it.

03:12:47.097 --> 03:12:51.958
TRAVIS: I'll fire the first two Eldritch Blasts at
one of them that's swimming, though not the one

03:12:51.958 --> 03:12:53.860
that's in melee of her.

03:12:53.860 --> 03:12:57.831
MATT: Okay. The first one's going to be at one of
the ones that's untouched.

03:12:57.831 --> 03:13:04.375
TRAVIS: That sucks. That's a one and a two, so I
think both of those fucking miss. That's incredible.

03:13:04.771 --> 03:13:07.076
MATT: Yep. Both (whiffing).

03:13:07.076 --> 03:13:09.025
MARISHA: We're rolling like garbage.

03:13:09.025 --> 03:13:10.845
TRAVIS: I'll fire the next two--

03:13:10.845 --> 03:13:11.756
MATT: Next two?

03:13:11.756 --> 03:13:14.672
TRAVIS: Because I'm hasted, so I have a second
attack?

03:13:14.672 --> 03:13:20.096
MATT: The second attack action can only be used
for a single weapon attack or disengage, dash--

03:13:20.096 --> 03:13:22.513
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

03:13:22.513 --> 03:13:24.348
MATT: Yeah, so you have to use your sword.

03:13:24.348 --> 03:13:26.118
LAURA: Use your sword!

03:13:26.118 --> 03:13:27.637
TRAVIS: Yeah, I guess I'll just--

03:13:27.637 --> 03:13:29.439
LAURA: Attack the one at Beau.

03:13:29.439 --> 03:13:31.811
TRAVIS: -- summon the falchion and take a swing at
it.

03:13:31.811 --> 03:13:35.901
MATT: The falchion comes into your hand. You dash
towards which one? The one with Beau or--?

03:13:35.901 --> 03:13:39.716
TRAVIS: It's a two. I do nothing. Nothing.

03:13:39.716 --> 03:13:45.521
MATT: Oh, buddy. Underwater man not feeling very
underwater-like right now, unfortunately!

03:13:45.521 --> 03:13:47.305
TRAVIS: (singing) Shitty rolls!

03:13:47.305 --> 03:13:50.535
MATT: That's okay. Finishes your go. Top of the
round, Caleb and Jester.

03:13:50.535 --> 03:13:52.734
SAM: Well, that was easy.

03:13:52.734 --> 03:13:58.466
LAURA: Okay. I'm going Toll the Dead at the one at
Beau.

03:13:58.466 --> 03:14:00.556
MATT: It makes its saving throw.

03:14:00.556 --> 03:14:02.425
TALIESIN: Negative d4.

03:14:02.425 --> 03:14:05.236
MATT: That's right. That's a natural 16--

03:14:05.236 --> 03:14:08.316
TALIESIN: Oh wait, no, not that one. I'm so sorry.
Not that one. That one doesn't have the d4.

03:14:08.316 --> 03:14:09.939
MATT: What was the save?

03:14:09.939 --> 03:14:12.135
LAURA: Wisdom. 15.

03:14:12.135 --> 03:14:20.538
MATT: Yeah, it's 16. Sorry. That finishes your
turn, then, or are you going to move closer? Stay put?

03:14:20.540 --> 03:14:22.743
LAURA: I'm going to stay put.

03:14:22.743 --> 03:14:24.404
MATT: All right, you stay put. Caleb.

03:14:24.404 --> 03:14:28.925
LIAM: I'm going to try to do a bit of a science
experiment, and cast Fire Bolt at the one next to

03:14:28.925 --> 03:14:31.075
Beauregard, and see if it even works down here.

03:14:31.075 --> 03:14:32.778
MATT: Okay. At your range, roll for attack.

03:14:32.778 --> 03:14:39.832
LIAM: Okay. Ah, no. I rolled a two.

03:14:39.832 --> 03:14:41.250
TRAVIS: What the fuck!

03:14:41.250 --> 03:14:44.268
MATT: It travels half the distance, then sputters
out, consumed by the ocean.

03:14:44.859 --> 03:14:46.278
SAM: Oh, so it wouldn't have worked?

03:14:46.278 --> 03:14:47.377
MATT: You don't know.

03:14:47.377 --> 03:14:48.483
LIAM: I move back.

03:14:48.483 --> 03:14:50.359
MATT: You move back even further. Yasha, you're
up.

03:14:50.359 --> 03:14:51.978
LAURA: Yasha, you better fucking help us.

03:14:51.978 --> 03:14:54.880
MATT: You can move your 20 feet and get in range
for any of them.

03:14:54.880 --> 03:14:57.209
ASHLEY: I'm going to move my 20 feet and get into
range.

03:14:57.209 --> 03:15:01.858
MATT: Take your pick. There's three untouched, and
there's one that Beau has done some damage to.

03:15:01.858 --> 03:15:07.951
ASHLEY: I'll get to it on the other side. I'll get
to whichever's closest. They're on the other side,

03:15:07.951 --> 03:15:09.872
right, of the group?

03:15:09.872 --> 03:15:10.641
MATT: Yes.

03:15:10.641 --> 03:15:12.740
ASHLEY: Yeah. I'll get one, whoever's closest to
me.

03:15:12.740 --> 03:15:18.250
MATT: One of those that's untouched yet. It's
disadvantage on your attacks with melee underwater.

03:15:19.120 --> 03:15:20.346
ASHLEY: Unless I reckless.

03:15:20.346 --> 03:15:22.950
MATT: Unless you're reckless, in which case
they're straight rolls. Are you reckless?

03:15:22.950 --> 03:15:24.240
ASHLEY: Let's do that. I'm reckless.

03:15:24.240 --> 03:15:26.550
MATT: Go for it. First attack, single roll.

03:15:26.550 --> 03:15:31.100
ASHLEY: Yeah, that'll hit. 23.

03:15:31.100 --> 03:15:34.878
MATT: 23 hits. Roll damage. This is your full
3d6.

03:15:34.878 --> 03:15:36.420
LAURA: Are you raging?

03:15:36.420 --> 03:15:37.566
ASHLEY: I'm raging.

03:15:37.566 --> 03:15:39.421
MATT: Okay, there you go. I'll let you do that.

03:15:39.421 --> 03:15:40.225
ASHLEY: Sorry.

03:15:40.225 --> 03:15:42.899
MATT: It's okay. Remember that.

03:15:42.899 --> 03:15:49.916
ASHLEY: All right. 20.

03:15:49.916 --> 03:15:55.662
MATT: 20 points with the first strike. It carves
through, immediately filling the water around it

03:15:55.662 --> 03:15:59.990
with its dark blood as it scrambles around. Looks
pretty hurt.

03:15:59.990 --> 03:16:01.790
ASHLEY: Okay. Second attack, I'll hit it again.

03:16:01.790 --> 03:16:03.398
MATT: Go for it.

03:16:03.398 --> 03:16:04.945
SAM: Come on!

03:16:04.945 --> 03:16:07.526
ASHLEY: Ugh. Reckless.

03:16:07.526 --> 03:16:09.859
MATT: Well, reckless is a single attack.

03:16:09.859 --> 03:16:11.458
ASHLEY: Got it. That was a natural one.

03:16:11.899 --> 03:16:14.999
MATT: Ooh, no. Second one goes wide. You're not
used to fighting underwater. You've only done it a

03:16:14.999 --> 03:16:21.678
few times, and still, it's a big blade through a
lot of resistance. That finishes your go.

03:16:21.678 --> 03:16:23.337
Caduceus, you're up.

03:16:23.337 --> 03:16:33.186
TALIESIN: I'm going to keep my distance. I'm going
to back up a little bit, and I'm going to use

03:16:33.186 --> 03:16:40.330
Sacred Flame on the one that is in combat with
Yasha. It's dex save.

03:16:40.330 --> 03:16:42.798
MATT: Natural seven. That's a failure. It has a
minus one.

03:16:42.798 --> 03:16:51.588
TALIESIN: Do I want to do this? Yeah. Five points
of radiant damage.

03:16:51.588 --> 03:16:58.759
MATT: The burst of light from underneath it hits
it. It starts gurgling in pain.

03:16:58.759 --> 03:17:02.828
LAURA: That was a seven. That wasn't a one. That
was a seven and a four.

03:17:02.828 --> 03:17:08.244
TALIESIN: Thank you. 11 points of radiant damage.
Thank you. My brain is burnt.

03:17:08.244 --> 03:17:18.288
MATT: It is holding on by a thread. It is torn
asunder, and you can-- bless you. It's obscured by

03:17:18.288 --> 03:17:23.637
a cloud of its own murky blood right now. That
finishes your turn, Caduceus? Nott, you're up.

03:17:23.637 --> 03:17:27.308
SAM: Fire at the one next to Beau. 14 to hit.

03:17:27.308 --> 03:17:30.170
MATT: 14 hits. Roll damage.

03:17:30.170 --> 03:17:31.517
LAURA: Yeah.

03:17:31.517 --> 03:17:35.739
SAM: Okay, okay, okay. Ten.

03:17:35.739 --> 03:17:38.322
LAURA: That's the first time I've heard Sam say
"Okay, okay, okay."

03:17:38.322 --> 03:17:40.805
SAM and ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.

03:17:40.805 --> 03:17:43.565
(laughter)

03:17:43.565 --> 03:17:44.619
SAM: 27.

03:17:44.619 --> 03:17:50.309
MATT: (impact) It is done.

03:17:50.309 --> 03:17:52.771
SAM: (crossbow reloading) Bonus action. Shoot the
one next to Yasha.

03:17:52.771 --> 03:17:54.528
MATT: Okay, go for it.

03:17:54.528 --> 03:17:56.720
SAM: That doesn't hit. Only 11.

03:17:56.720 --> 03:17:57.911
MATT: 11 hits exactly.

03:17:57.911 --> 03:18:01.224
SAM: Oh, yay. Actually, it's 13. I lied.

03:18:01.224 --> 03:18:03.494
MATT: Even better! There you go. Definitely hits.

03:18:03.494 --> 03:18:05.079
SAM: Not sneak attack. I only get that once.

03:18:05.079 --> 03:18:07.786
MATT: Correct. You only get that once per turn.

03:18:07.786 --> 03:18:09.308
SAM: Three plus five. Eight.

03:18:09.308 --> 03:18:16.077
MATT: Eight damage. One (gurgling); the other one
(gurgling). Two immediate fires. Two of them go

03:18:16.077 --> 03:18:19.290
limp and begin to float in their own ichor. Well
done.

03:18:19.290 --> 03:18:20.910
SAM: I swim closer to Caleb.

03:18:20.910 --> 03:18:26.739
MATT: Okay, finishes Nott's go. It's their turn.
Now they're in range. Two of them move, one of

03:18:26.739 --> 03:18:34.278
them towards you, Yasha, and one's against Beau.
Trying to-- it's been a lot.

03:18:34.278 --> 03:18:36.884
MARISHA: You can call me Yasha. I'll take it.

03:18:36.884 --> 03:18:43.965
MATT: It's going to make two attacks against you
with its unarmed strike. It's clawing at you with

03:18:44.163 --> 03:18:50.419
its hands. That is a 12 and a 19.

03:18:50.419 --> 03:18:52.129
MARISHA: Miss. Second one hits.

03:18:52.129 --> 03:18:53.979
TALIESIN: Is that with a negative d4?

03:18:53.979 --> 03:18:57.255
MATT: Oh, no. Let me do that. 18. Misses!

03:18:57.255 --> 03:18:59.784
TRAVIS: Fucking Bane, man!

03:18:59.784 --> 03:19:00.783
MARISHA: AC 19.

03:19:00.783 --> 03:19:04.767
MATT: On the third strike, it's going to use its
Piscine Anatomy.

03:19:04.767 --> 03:19:06.290
LAURA: What is that?

03:19:06.290 --> 03:19:13.061
MARISHA: It has a prehensile penis. Sorry.

03:19:13.061 --> 03:19:14.706
TALIESIN: Ruin everything.

03:19:14.706 --> 03:19:20.374
MATT: I mean, one of the other ones, maybe, but
that one, no. This one, it strikes twice at you

03:19:20.374 --> 03:19:27.117
with its claws. Then its throat (bubbling,
spitting), and it spits this tiny needle towards you.

03:19:27.504 --> 03:19:28.703
LIAM: (exaggerated Southern accent)
Careful, they spit.

03:19:28.703 --> 03:19:30.580
LAURA: (exaggerated Southern accent)
Careful, they spit needles.

03:19:30.580 --> 03:19:36.001
MATT: That's going to be 21. Oh, with another
negative three. 18.

03:19:36.001 --> 03:19:36.932
MARISHA: Miss!

03:19:36.932 --> 03:19:45.982
TALIESIN: I love Bane so much. Where has it been
all my life? Oh! It's so hateful.

03:19:45.982 --> 03:19:51.839
MATT: The other one is going to attack you twice,
Yasha. You were reckless, so it has advantage on

03:19:51.839 --> 03:20:03.362
its attacks against you. It would be 19 and a 16.
19 minus two, so it's a 17.

03:20:03.362 --> 03:20:04.111
ASHLEY: Hits.

03:20:04.111 --> 03:20:07.321
MATT: 16 minus three is a 13.

03:20:07.321 --> 03:20:09.574
ASHLEY: Doesn't hit. So one hits.

03:20:09.574 --> 03:20:15.482
MATT: One hits you for six points of piercing
damage, as it claws-- or this would be a bite. It

03:20:15.482 --> 03:20:17.022
grabs and bites towards you.

03:20:17.022 --> 03:20:18.150
TALIESIN: Reduced to half?

03:20:18.150 --> 03:20:20.541
MATT: Oh, no, it's a strike, so bludgeoning. It's
halved to three. You take three points of

03:20:20.541 --> 03:20:27.982
bludgeoning damage. This one is going to attempt
to grab you with the tentacle. Natural 20.

03:20:29.962 --> 03:20:36.144
TALIESIN: Does he get a bonus for that natural 20?
Does he get some sort of bonus to that natural 20?

03:20:36.528 --> 03:20:37.864
Does that make something better about that?

03:20:37.864 --> 03:20:39.125
MATT: You don't know.

03:20:39.125 --> 03:20:42.207
TALIESIN: I mean, because I'm going to cancel it,
if it does anything.

03:20:42.207 --> 03:20:44.416
MATT: It's a critical hit, up to you. Are you
canceling it or not?

03:20:44.416 --> 03:20:46.066
TALIESIN: I'm canceling it.

03:20:46.066 --> 03:20:49.311
MATT: Okay. It still hits, but it's not a
critical. You take eight points of bludgeoning

03:20:49.311 --> 03:20:56.982
damage, reduced to four, and you are grappled. As
its tentacle reaches around you, another one that

03:20:56.982 --> 03:21:01.334
looks like it has a protrusion from its chest,
almost like a third arm-- it's a tentacle that

03:21:01.334 --> 03:21:06.411
wraps around, and grabs at your torso, and is
crushing you. You can feel faint bits of it that

03:21:06.411 --> 03:21:11.714
are scraping at the skin. That finishes their
turn. Beau, you're up.

03:21:11.714 --> 03:21:16.708
MARISHA: The one in front of me is dead. I head to
the next one. How far away?

03:21:16.708 --> 03:21:19.942
MATT: There's the one that was attacking you
that's right in your face, and there's the one

03:21:19.942 --> 03:21:22.159
that's grappled Yasha with a tentacle.

03:21:22.159 --> 03:21:24.285
SAM: A different one swam up to you.

03:21:24.285 --> 03:21:27.938
MARISHA: Yasha's fine. I'll hit the one in front
of me.

03:21:27.938 --> 03:21:30.941
MATT: Go for it. Two attacks with disadvantage.

03:21:30.941 --> 03:21:37.675
MARISHA: First attack with disadvantage hits.
That's a natural 14. I'm going to use my staff on

03:21:37.675 --> 03:21:43.144
this one. I hope he is fine with non-magical
attacks. Eight damage.

03:21:43.144 --> 03:21:46.504
MATT: Eight damage, all righty. (impact)

03:21:46.504 --> 03:21:48.572
MARISHA: Did it look like he took the full
damage?

03:21:48.572 --> 03:21:51.989
MATT: It looks like a person or a creature that
had been hit with a staff pretty hard.

03:21:51.989 --> 03:21:56.761
MARISHA: Mm-hmm. Sticks hurt. Next one, probably.
11?

03:21:56.761 --> 03:21:58.148
MATT: 11 just hits.

03:21:58.148 --> 03:22:03.493
MARISHA: Oh! That's a lot. 12.

03:22:03.493 --> 03:22:09.132
MATT: 12 points of damage. Its jaw snaps out of
place. It looks like it's trying to bite towards

03:22:09.132 --> 03:22:12.573
you, but its jaw is limply unable to close.

03:22:12.573 --> 03:22:13.729
MARISHA: It's still going?

03:22:13.729 --> 03:22:15.370
MATT: It's still going.

03:22:15.370 --> 03:22:17.591
MARISHA: Flurry of Blows.

03:22:17.591 --> 03:22:19.092
MATT: Ki point. Two more hits.

03:22:19.092 --> 03:22:26.232
MARISHA: Ki point. Two more hits. First one hits,
barely, but hits with a 13.

03:22:26.232 --> 03:22:28.483
MATT: All right, roll your--

03:22:28.483 --> 03:22:32.814
MARISHA: Mm-hmm! 11 damage.

03:22:32.814 --> 03:22:40.540
MATT: 11 damage? You crack again. The jaw actually
tears off, and blood's filling. Its eyes are going

03:22:40.540 --> 03:22:42.674
wide. It's barely holding on.

03:22:42.674 --> 03:22:45.987
MARISHA: No, sorry, six plus four. Ten.

03:22:45.987 --> 03:22:51.076
MATT: Okay, so ten damage, gotcha. All right,
that's all right. And your final attack?

03:22:51.076 --> 03:22:58.489
MARISHA: I was looking at my wrong thing. Hits,
and one more time. Please, die. Six.

03:22:58.489 --> 03:23:02.790
MATT: Okay. With the last hit as its jaw snapped
apart, you grab its head and ram it into your

03:23:02.790 --> 03:23:07.276
knee, and as you pull the leg back, the face is
collapsed inward and it goes limp.

03:23:07.276 --> 03:23:08.351
LAURA: Eww.

03:23:08.351 --> 03:23:13.900
MARISHA: I do that thing where I try to water
current its bloody guts away from me so I'm not

03:23:13.900 --> 03:23:15.190
inhaling it.

03:23:15.190 --> 03:23:18.860
MATT: Like, "Oh, god." Okay. That finishes your
go. Fjord.

03:23:18.860 --> 03:23:20.133
TRAVIS: How many are up still?

03:23:20.133 --> 03:23:23.632
MATT: One left and it currently has Yasha grappled
in the tentacle and trying to crush her.

03:23:23.632 --> 03:23:26.956
TRAVIS: So here's a question, that very first one
that we lit up like the Godfather?

03:23:26.956 --> 03:23:27.810
MATT: Yep.

03:23:27.810 --> 03:23:34.020
TRAVIS: With my bonus action, can I reach out,
since I was part of the killing of-- are these

03:23:34.020 --> 03:23:34.842
creatures humanoids?

03:23:34.842 --> 03:23:37.172
MATT: They are.

03:23:37.172 --> 03:23:44.996
TRAVIS: Can I reach forward and go: (in a demonic
voice) Rise, and I'll Accursed Specter the creature.

03:23:45.366 --> 03:23:54.363
MATT: You may. As the body is floating in the
water away, this cold sensation takes the nearby

03:23:54.363 --> 03:24:01.114
20-foot radius around it. What little bit of light
is filtering through here gets darker and a

03:24:01.114 --> 03:24:09.009
darkened spectral form emerges from its body. This
ghostly wraith emerges from the corpse under

03:24:09.009 --> 03:24:10.516
Fjord's command.

03:24:10.516 --> 03:24:15.867
TRAVIS: I'll say that and go (concussion sound)
and throw two more Eldritch Blasts at the one

03:24:15.867 --> 03:24:16.968
that's remaining.

03:24:16.968 --> 03:24:18.356
MATT: Go for it.

03:24:18.356 --> 03:24:19.433
TRAVIS: That's a 24.

03:24:19.433 --> 03:24:20.478
MATT: That hits.

03:24:20.478 --> 03:24:22.599
TRAVIS: The other one is a 14.

03:24:22.599 --> 03:24:25.001
MATT: That hits. Damage on both.

03:24:25.001 --> 03:24:37.077
TRAVIS: (singing) This is the age of Aquarius.
That's ten points and eight. So 18.

03:24:37.077 --> 03:24:41.859
MATT: 18 points of damage. Both bolts (impact
sounds) into it. It's damaged, but it's still

03:24:41.859 --> 03:24:43.509
holding on and it's turning towards--

03:24:43.509 --> 03:24:45.465
TRAVIS: Great. I'll take my speed and rush at it.

03:24:45.465 --> 03:24:47.677
MATT: Dash in with the blade out at the side.

03:24:47.677 --> 03:24:49.106
TRAVIS: Take a strike.

03:24:49.106 --> 03:24:51.579
MATT: Make your strike.

03:24:51.579 --> 03:24:52.584
TRAVIS: Oh, dope. 16.

03:24:52.584 --> 03:24:56.456
MATT: You do not have disadvantage because of your
armor, so that hits. Go ahead and roll damage with

03:24:56.456 --> 03:24:57.741
your blade.

03:24:57.741 --> 03:25:04.806
TRAVIS: 1d8 plus-- two points of damage. One plus
one.

03:25:04.806 --> 03:25:05.876
SAM: Nice!

03:25:05.876 --> 03:25:07.235
MATT: Well--

03:25:07.235 --> 03:25:09.732
TRAVIS: It's 1d8 plus one.

03:25:09.732 --> 03:25:11.883
MATT: Don't you get to add your charisma modifier
to the damage bonus?

03:25:11.883 --> 03:25:14.644
TRAVIS: I don't see that on here.

03:25:14.644 --> 03:25:22.279
MATT: Pretty sure as a hexblade warlock you get to
add your charisma bonus to attack and damage

03:25:22.279 --> 03:25:25.143
rolls, right? Am I wrong about that?

03:25:25.143 --> 03:25:27.192
TRAVIS: I ain't been doing it.

03:25:27.192 --> 03:25:30.721
MATT: You have in the past, I'm pretty sure,
unless I'm reading this wrong.

03:25:30.721 --> 03:25:33.055
TRAVIS: I thought it would be added into the
weapon, naturally.

03:25:33.055 --> 03:25:34.215
MARISHA: D&amp;D Beyond?

03:25:34.215 --> 03:25:35.825
MATT: It should be.

03:25:35.825 --> 03:25:37.544
TRAVIS: Yeah, it just says 1d8 plus one.

03:25:37.544 --> 03:25:39.068
SAM: Call tech support.

03:25:39.068 --> 03:25:41.512
MATT: Yeah, it's based on your strength. Maybe it
updated recently and that got reset.

03:25:41.512 --> 03:25:42.327
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:25:42.327 --> 03:25:43.749
MATT: I'll have to double check because--

03:25:43.749 --> 03:25:46.165
TRAVIS: My charisma bonus is four.

03:25:46.165 --> 03:25:47.030
MATT: Correct.

03:25:47.030 --> 03:25:49.059
LAURA: So it would be five more points of--

03:25:49.059 --> 03:25:51.900
MATT: Well, it should be an additional plus four
damage, is what it should be.

03:25:51.900 --> 03:25:53.806
TRAVIS: Yeah. So it would be six on a two.

03:25:53.806 --> 03:25:57.166
MATT: Yeah, right. I'll fix that.

03:25:57.166 --> 03:25:58.354
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:25:58.354 --> 03:26:05.036
MATT: Okay. After the two impacts and the sword
slicing through it, it's still standing, but it's

03:26:05.036 --> 03:26:09.398
hurt. It's still holding onto Yasha and right now
it's distracted, trying to figure out which way to

03:26:09.398 --> 03:26:11.379
go. That finishes your go, Fjord?

03:26:11.379 --> 03:26:12.305
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

03:26:12.305 --> 03:26:14.839
MATT: Caleb and Jester, you're up next.

03:26:14.839 --> 03:26:16.017
LIAM: What's left? What's--

03:26:16.017 --> 03:26:18.206
MATT: There's one holding onto Yasha.

03:26:18.206 --> 03:26:19.716
LIAM: Oh, Magic Missile.

03:26:19.716 --> 03:26:21.858
LAURA: Toll the Dead at the same time!

03:26:21.858 --> 03:26:22.546
MARISHA: Yeah!

03:26:22.546 --> 03:26:25.415
MATT: That is a 13 on its Toll the Dead.

03:26:25.415 --> 03:26:27.683
LAURA: Ah! Doesn't save.

03:26:27.683 --> 03:26:29.589
MATT: And the-- 12 damage?

03:26:29.589 --> 03:26:30.609
LIAM: Yeah.

03:26:30.609 --> 03:26:35.115
LAURA: Oh. 22 points.

03:26:35.115 --> 03:26:35.827
MATT: Ooh.

03:26:35.827 --> 03:26:37.229
TALIESIN: Jesus.

03:26:37.229 --> 03:26:40.442
LAURA: Of (tolling bell) damage through the
water.

03:26:40.442 --> 03:26:44.460
MATT: As the tentacle is grappling and crushing
your body and you're trying to find a way to force

03:26:44.460 --> 03:26:48.764
your way through, suddenly, the tentacle just
pulls away. You look over towards it; the tentacle

03:26:48.764 --> 03:26:55.806
isn't attached to anything. It is turned to chum
in the water as bits of its scattered body begin

03:26:55.806 --> 03:27:02.823
to slowly dissipate and disseminate throughout the
nearby sea.

03:27:02.823 --> 03:27:06.468
LAURA: The Toll the Dead vibrations going through
the water so all of us can feel it.

03:27:06.468 --> 03:27:11.311
MATT: (thrumming) Magic Missiles impacting and
scattering its form. Currently, there doesn't

03:27:11.311 --> 03:27:16.412
appear to be any of these creatures around you.
There's just the darkness of the tower below and

03:27:16.412 --> 03:27:18.476
whatever the inside of it holds.

03:27:18.476 --> 03:27:20.021
LAURA: Go team!

03:27:20.021 --> 03:27:22.992
SAM: That was good. Anyone need healing?

03:27:22.992 --> 03:27:24.326
MARISHA: I'm good.

03:27:24.326 --> 03:27:26.042
ASHLEY: I'm fine.

03:27:26.042 --> 03:27:28.691
TRAVIS: We have a friend.

03:27:28.691 --> 03:27:29.702
MARISHA: What?

03:27:29.702 --> 03:27:33.692
TRAVIS: I'll bring the specter forward.

03:27:33.692 --> 03:27:38.680
MATT: It's hard to see this low in the water when
there's so little light when it's not moving. Once

03:27:38.680 --> 03:27:44.194
it shifts, it's like watching a shadow out of the
corner of your eye, with these two faintly dull,

03:27:44.194 --> 03:27:51.724
glowing yellow eyes. It's vaguely humanoid in its
shape, but it's almost smoky and amorphous when it

03:27:51.724 --> 03:27:57.878
shifts and moves and finds its place nearby. Its
head lolls around a bit, mimicking the shape and

03:27:57.878 --> 03:28:01.360
the movement of the creature before it was engaged
in combat.

03:28:01.360 --> 03:28:05.627
TRAVIS: I feel bad having Frumpkin be the one
that's always putting himself in harm's way,

03:28:05.627 --> 03:28:13.467
thought I'd give him a friend. I'll send the
specter towards the mouth of the tower.

03:28:13.467 --> 03:28:15.961
MATT: Okay. You sending it in there by itself?

03:28:15.961 --> 03:28:17.378
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

03:28:17.378 --> 03:28:18.291
MATT: Okay.

03:28:18.291 --> 03:28:19.731
ASHLEY: Oh, why--?

03:28:19.731 --> 03:28:24.025
MATT: You guys watch as the specter vanishes into
the shadow of the tower below.

03:28:24.025 --> 03:28:27.647
SAM: Does anything happen?

03:28:27.647 --> 03:28:30.672
LAURA: Can you see through its eyes like
Frumpkin?

03:28:30.672 --> 03:28:32.206
TRAVIS: Nope.

03:28:32.206 --> 03:28:33.987
SAM: Just send him away?

03:28:33.987 --> 03:28:36.143
TRAVIS: I just wanted to send him to the
entrance.

03:28:36.143 --> 03:28:37.179
MATT: Oh, just the entrance?

03:28:37.179 --> 03:28:38.833
TRAVIS: Yeah, just to the front.

03:28:38.833 --> 03:28:41.206
MATT: Okay. It moves, comes to the top--

03:28:41.206 --> 03:28:43.405
TRAVIS: Just to make sure the tower's not like
(violent chomping).

03:28:43.405 --> 03:28:46.848
MATT: No, it does not open its maw and devour your
specter.

03:28:46.848 --> 03:28:49.476
TRAVIS: Don't make that face! I wouldn't put that
past you for one second.

03:28:49.476 --> 03:28:58.104
MATT: Fair enough. Yeah, it drifts in and once it
hits the mouth of it, it's near impossible to see

03:28:58.104 --> 03:29:04.433
because it's just black on black until you see its
head turn and you can see the very faint light of

03:29:04.433 --> 03:29:10.185
its eyes. It sits there, awaiting its next
command. It's making you uncomfortable.

03:29:10.185 --> 03:29:13.518
TALIESIN: Yeah, no, I'm pretty uncomfortable about
all of this. Yeah.

03:29:13.518 --> 03:29:15.335
TRAVIS: It's not a permanent thing.

03:29:15.335 --> 03:29:18.676
TALIESIN: This is definitely getting very
after-school special for me and the kid just

03:29:18.676 --> 03:29:22.259
brought out the bag of weed in the after-school
special and I'm like, "Oh."

03:29:22.259 --> 03:29:24.129
TRAVIS: Just give it a try.

03:29:24.129 --> 03:29:29.671
TALIESIN: Oh, the police officer came to our
school and talked about this. Okay.

03:29:29.671 --> 03:29:32.046
TRAVIS: Ruh-roh, hey kids.

03:29:32.046 --> 03:29:37.209
TALIESIN: No. (sighs) Yeah, all right, let's do
this.

03:29:37.209 --> 03:29:44.665
LAURA: There's no other entrance on the tower?
Just the one? That we see?

03:29:44.665 --> 03:29:47.878
MATT: As far as you can tell, there is just the
one entrance.

03:29:49.698 --> 03:29:52.459
TRAVIS: Yeah. We'll move closer.

03:29:52.459 --> 03:29:55.407
MATT: If you want to try and swim along the edges
of it, you can look for other entrances.

03:29:55.834 --> 03:29:58.632
LIAM: Hold on a minute. Go. Look around the
tower.

03:29:58.632 --> 03:30:00.724
MATT: Perception check for Frumpkin, please.

03:30:00.724 --> 03:30:04.918
LIAM: Yeah. He'll spiral around, look for any
other entrances. Oh jeez, it jumped on the box,

03:30:04.918 --> 03:30:07.556
cocked. Natural one.

03:30:07.556 --> 03:30:18.198
MATT: Okay. Frumpkin, having a hard time seeing
through the clustered seaweed. Around its base-- I

03:30:18.447 --> 03:30:25.308
mean, with a natural one, yeah, you don't see
anything. Frumpkin makes out no shapes or anything

03:30:25.308 --> 03:30:30.284
within that period. Frumpkin's not used to being
an octopus, okay? He still hasn't quite figured it out.

03:30:30.284 --> 03:30:32.398
LIAM: That's what I've been saying all this time.

03:30:32.398 --> 03:30:34.307
TRAVIS: I'm a bit faster. I'll go.

03:30:34.307 --> 03:30:37.418
LIAM: I summon my octopus back to my head.

03:30:37.418 --> 03:30:38.102
MATT: Okay.

03:30:38.102 --> 03:30:44.329
TRAVIS: Hang back for a second. I'll use 45 feet
of my speed to move forward.

03:30:44.329 --> 03:30:46.845
MATT: You're not in combat right now so we can
just--

03:30:46.845 --> 03:30:49.447
TRAVIS: I'm still fucking Hasted.

03:30:49.447 --> 03:30:55.115
MATT: That's true, though you're getting really
close to the end of it. It lasts for a minute so--

03:30:55.361 --> 03:30:56.328
TRAVIS: Oh, does it? Sorry.

03:30:56.328 --> 03:30:57.427
LIAM: We did some talking.

03:30:57.427 --> 03:30:59.166
MATT: You guys have been chatting back and forth
and doing this, and especially with Frumpkin

03:30:59.166 --> 03:31:01.568
looking around like that, yeah, Haste has worn
off.

03:31:01.568 --> 03:31:03.634
TRAVIS: Now I have one level of exhaustion,
right?

03:31:03.634 --> 03:31:08.012
MATT: No, you just get stunned for a round.
But you're not in combat anymore.

03:31:08.012 --> 03:31:10.777
LIAM: You just went (gasping), and then it's
gone.

03:31:10.777 --> 03:31:18.456
MATT: Yeah, a little heart palpitation moment.
Okay. Are you going to do a spiral around it or

03:31:18.456 --> 03:31:20.910
are you going to go down one side? What are you
doing? Are you just stopping?

03:31:20.910 --> 03:31:22.135
TRAVIS: Are we above it?

03:31:22.135 --> 03:31:26.733
MATT: You guys are above it. At this point, you're
about 60 or so feet above the top of this curved tower.

03:31:26.927 --> 03:31:28.233
TRAVIS: It's at an angle, right?

03:31:28.233 --> 03:31:29.506
MATT: It's at a slight angle, yeah.

03:31:29.506 --> 03:31:31.245
LIAM: Travis, how are you going to handle the
shaft?

03:31:31.245 --> 03:31:36.242
TRAVIS: I'd like to spiral down, slowly making my
way around the top so I can see.

03:31:36.242 --> 03:31:39.006
MATT: Okay. Are you doing it stealthily or are you
trying to go for speed?

03:31:39.006 --> 03:31:40.601
TRAVIS: Stealthily.

03:31:40.601 --> 03:31:43.607
MATT: All right. It'll take you a little bit, but
go ahead and roll a stealth check.

03:31:43.607 --> 03:31:45.325
LIAM: Start at the base.

03:31:45.325 --> 03:31:47.699
LAURA: Oh, I give-- bless you!

03:31:47.699 --> 03:31:49.477
SAM: (mocking Laura in gibberish)

03:31:49.477 --> 03:31:50.868
TRAVIS: What is that for?

03:31:50.868 --> 03:31:52.100
LAURA: You get advantage.

03:31:52.100 --> 03:31:53.272
TRAVIS: I do get advantage?

03:31:53.272 --> 03:31:55.683
MATT: Yeah. Blessing of the Trickster.

03:31:55.683 --> 03:31:57.834
TRAVIS: That's good. Ugh. Nine.

03:31:57.834 --> 03:31:58.772
MARISHA: Nein.

03:31:58.772 --> 03:32:02.609
MATT: All right. Make a perception check for me,
please, as you're keeping an eye out.

03:32:02.609 --> 03:32:08.295
LAURA: I'm also keeping an eye out to see if I see
anything come out of the front entrance.

03:32:08.295 --> 03:32:11.319
MATT: Okay. Make a perception check.

03:32:11.319 --> 03:32:11.917
TRAVIS: 16.

03:32:11.917 --> 03:32:19.175
MATT: All right. As you curl down, there are
slits. There are narrow peering points at

03:32:19.175 --> 03:32:27.441
different areas. You do see the occasional window
or an opening where somebody could probably

03:32:27.441 --> 03:32:34.292
squeeze through. At the very base of it, there
does appear to be an open doorway.

03:32:34.292 --> 03:32:39.258
TRAVIS: The top of the tower is open and it
continues through the middle?

03:32:39.258 --> 03:32:40.481
MATT: Correct.

03:32:40.481 --> 03:32:42.310
LAURA: 17 perception.

03:32:42.310 --> 03:32:49.062
MATT: Okay. You're keeping an eye out from the
top. As you head down, you see that entranceway,

03:32:49.062 --> 03:32:55.961
look over, look around and see the other faint
bits of windows. You look back down at the door

03:32:55.961 --> 03:33:04.688
and you see the very edge of something in the
door. You see a yellowish-green shape, looks

03:33:04.688 --> 03:33:15.238
almost-- best I can describe it at this distance
is a hint of crustacean that then vanishes into

03:33:15.238 --> 03:33:16.981
the doorway.

03:33:16.981 --> 03:33:21.617
TRAVIS: I swim over to the edge of the tower to
try and lean up against the side of it. Make

03:33:21.617 --> 03:33:24.016
myself less obvious out in the open water.

03:33:24.016 --> 03:33:27.154
MATT: Okay. You wait for 30 seconds. A minute.

03:33:27.154 --> 03:33:28.595
TRAVIS: Does somebody appear?

03:33:28.595 --> 03:33:31.833
MATT: Nothing, but you get the sense that
something noticed you.

03:33:34.985 --> 03:33:42.047
TRAVIS: Well, don't want to go in that way. I wave
everybody down.

03:33:42.047 --> 03:33:43.139
MARISHA: I swim down.

03:33:43.139 --> 03:33:44.935
MATT: Okay, you all join Fjord.

03:33:45.861 --> 03:33:53.330
TRAVIS: I will relay that there is a doorway down
near the bottom, but something poked its pretty

03:33:53.330 --> 03:33:54.553
head out.

03:33:54.553 --> 03:33:56.749
LAURA: What did it look like?

03:33:56.749 --> 03:34:01.579
TRAVIS: Kind of greenish-yellow. Couldn't quite
see, but it kind of looked like an overgrown

03:34:01.579 --> 03:34:05.684
shrimp, crab-type thing. Kind of crustacean-y.

03:34:05.684 --> 03:34:06.756
LAURA: That's weird.

03:34:06.756 --> 03:34:13.140
TRAVIS: Yeah. Might just be the local wildlife,
right? What are the chances? We could just send

03:34:13.140 --> 03:34:17.116
our guest here down.

03:34:17.116 --> 03:34:20.808
LAURA: See if it attacks it? Sure.

03:34:20.808 --> 03:34:22.948
TRAVIS: Or we could go through the tunnel.

03:34:22.948 --> 03:34:25.821
LIAM: Maybe we could send your friend in the door
at the bottom while we go in the top?

03:34:25.821 --> 03:34:26.871
LAURA: Yeah.

03:34:26.871 --> 03:34:33.870
TRAVIS: I'd be fine with that. I will command the
specter to move towards the doorway and engage

03:34:33.870 --> 03:34:36.047
anything it finds.

03:34:36.047 --> 03:34:52.016
MATT: Okay. The specter drifts down to the center
of the doorway and hangs there.

03:34:52.016 --> 03:34:54.473
TRAVIS: Just at the doorway?

03:34:58.410 --> 03:35:01.565
LAURA: What does that mean? What did that delayed
reaction mean?

03:35:01.565 --> 03:35:03.076
TRAVIS: I push him inside.

03:35:03.076 --> 03:35:06.278
MATT: Okay. The specter vanishes inside.

03:35:06.278 --> 03:35:08.422
TRAVIS: Commotion?

03:35:08.422 --> 03:35:09.557
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:35:09.557 --> 03:35:10.861
LAURA: Ugh.

03:35:15.183 --> 03:35:19.509
TRAVIS: Balls. Ass. Three.

03:35:19.509 --> 03:35:25.611
MATT: Yeah, you don't hear anything. Caduceus,
just instinctually, you hear what sounds like the

03:35:25.611 --> 03:35:36.182
thrashing of water, the impact of scraping against
stone, more thrashing, then silence.

03:35:36.182 --> 03:35:39.797
TALIESIN: I think that was the end of your ghost
friend.

03:35:39.797 --> 03:35:41.981
TRAVIS: I don't know, they're pretty resilient,
but, okay.

03:35:41.981 --> 03:35:43.776
SAM: Yeah, maybe he won.

03:35:43.776 --> 03:35:47.405
TALIESIN: No. That was the end.

03:35:47.405 --> 03:35:54.866
TRAVIS: Well, let's assume then-- shall we assume
flanking positions?

03:35:54.866 --> 03:35:58.625
LAURA: Are we going in the top tunnel or the
bottom?

03:35:58.625 --> 03:36:05.536
TRAVIS: You know, if it's crustacean-y and it's
treating this tower as a shell, maybe I don't want

03:36:05.536 --> 03:36:08.481
to fight it in there.

03:36:10.587 --> 03:36:14.067
LIAM: What do you propose?

03:36:14.067 --> 03:36:20.684
MARISHA: I mean, it feels like this stuff is
always at the bottom or at the end.

03:36:20.684 --> 03:36:28.386
TRAVIS: How about we drop to the floor about 60
feet from the doorway and send in a care package?

03:36:29.633 --> 03:36:31.171
LAURA: Oh, attacks?

03:36:31.171 --> 03:36:32.850
TRAVIS: Yeah. Anything ranged.

03:36:32.850 --> 03:36:33.908
LAURA: Okay.

03:36:33.908 --> 03:36:35.553
TRAVIS: See if we get lucky.

03:36:35.553 --> 03:36:38.134
LAURA: All right.

03:36:38.134 --> 03:36:43.663
TRAVIS: I'll descend to the floor, keeping about
60 feet from the outside of the doorway.

03:36:43.663 --> 03:36:47.387
LAURA: Follow behind him and land.

03:36:47.387 --> 03:36:50.609
MATT: Okay, you're both now resting a distance
from it.

03:36:50.609 --> 03:36:57.109
MARISHA: Can I-- because I've got shit when it
comes to range-- cheat the distance and see if I

03:36:57.109 --> 03:37:01.331
can peek in from the top of the tower down?

03:37:01.331 --> 03:37:03.169
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:37:03.169 --> 03:37:08.711
MARISHA: While they do this? Okay, 18.

03:37:08.711 --> 03:37:16.153
MATT: With a lack of light-- you have your
goggles, which helps-- you can barely make out

03:37:16.153 --> 03:37:28.283
shapes, and there's a few of them. It's like
looking into a boiling pot where there's shapes

03:37:28.283 --> 03:37:34.104
shifting in different places, clustered. With what
little bit you can see at your peripheral, it's

03:37:34.104 --> 03:37:40.780
like whatever texture the bottom of this temple
has, the texture is moving.

03:37:40.780 --> 03:37:43.574
ASHLEY: How many feet down did you say from the
top?

03:37:43.574 --> 03:37:45.886
MATT: From the top? It's about 60 feet.

03:37:45.886 --> 03:37:54.134
MARISHA: While you guys sink, I went and peeked
through one of those windows and looked down.

03:37:54.134 --> 03:37:57.402
ASHLEY: Can I try and giving a look-see too
because I have darkvision?

03:37:57.402 --> 03:37:58.359
MATT: Sure.

03:37:58.359 --> 03:37:59.226
MARISHA: I do, too.

03:37:59.226 --> 03:38:00.221
ASHLEY: Oh, you already have it?

03:38:00.221 --> 03:38:02.778
MARISHA: Go ahead. You might roll higher than I
did.

03:38:02.778 --> 03:38:07.320
ASHLEY: What would the roll be? Is it perception?

03:38:07.320 --> 03:38:08.485
MATT: Mm-hmm.

03:38:08.485 --> 03:38:10.790
ASHLEY: 16.

03:38:10.790 --> 03:38:13.114
MATT: You make out the same thing.

03:38:13.114 --> 03:38:25.695
LIAM: I poof a little globule of light in my hand
and motion to Beauregard from far away and go--

03:38:26.141 --> 03:38:29.353
TALIESIN: I mean, they already know we're here.

03:38:30.977 --> 03:38:35.618
MARISHA: I look at Yasha: What do you think? Light
or no?

03:38:35.618 --> 03:38:37.555
LIAM: I make three more.

03:38:37.555 --> 03:38:38.772
ASHLEY: They do know we're here.

03:38:38.772 --> 03:38:46.657
MARISHA: Okay. I go-- over to Caleb, and Yasha and
I look in as he sends them in.

03:38:46.657 --> 03:38:48.646
MATT: Do you send them in?

03:38:48.646 --> 03:38:50.443
LIAM: How tall is the tower roughly?

03:38:50.443 --> 03:38:56.125
MATT: It's a little more than 60 feet tall to the
peak.

03:38:56.125 --> 03:39:03.846
LIAM: Okay, so I will stay 50 or 60 feet away from
the tower and I will send one in the top, one in

03:39:03.846 --> 03:39:06.469
the bottom, and two through windows.

03:39:06.469 --> 03:39:13.470
MATT: Okay. As you guys are paying attention and
glance inside, there are different shelves of

03:39:13.470 --> 03:39:18.134
broken floors that have either fallen through or
stairs that have collapsed where there's-- you can

03:39:18.134 --> 03:39:23.926
see where at one point, this temple may have been
ascended by somebody, but a hollow on the inside

03:39:23.926 --> 03:39:36.820
towards the base of it. You can see three of these
large creatures covered in chitinous-like armor.

03:39:36.820 --> 03:39:48.730
Their lower half has four legs that are
insect-like, or you could say crab-like if you

03:39:48.730 --> 03:39:55.488
will, and then the upper torso has two large
pincers that are jagged on the inside. Their

03:39:55.488 --> 03:40:02.975
face-- you don't see eyes; it's this smooth
surface with a series of these weird worm-like

03:40:02.975 --> 03:40:09.525
tentacles that emerge from underneath the mouth
that curl. As soon as the light hits, they begin

03:40:09.525 --> 03:40:15.586
to look around towards it and glancing up and they
have all backed into it and that shape that you

03:40:15.586 --> 03:40:20.763
were seeing before was all three of them clustered
together and rotating and moving in the space.

03:40:20.763 --> 03:40:23.574
MARISHA: But they're backing away from the light?

03:40:23.574 --> 03:40:30.742
MATT: They're not backing away from it. They're
back-to-back, looking and preparing for whatever

03:40:30.742 --> 03:40:32.607
is the source of this.

03:40:32.607 --> 03:40:33.721
TRAVIS: You got a fluffernutter ready to go?

03:40:33.721 --> 03:40:36.671
SAM: I do not.

03:40:36.671 --> 03:40:38.685
TRAVIS: Well, I don't even know why you're down
here.

03:40:38.685 --> 03:40:41.745
SAM: But I can make them laugh.

03:40:41.745 --> 03:40:45.666
LAURA: Who's within 30 feet?

03:40:45.666 --> 03:40:46.586
TRAVIS: I am.

03:40:46.586 --> 03:40:51.237
LAURA: You are. You are Nott. Yasha.

03:40:51.237 --> 03:40:53.952
LIAM: 30 feet from you or from the temple?

03:40:53.952 --> 03:40:57.284
LAURA: Yeah. Who's within 30 feet of me?

03:40:57.284 --> 03:41:02.106
LIAM: I might be. You're always back.

03:41:02.106 --> 03:41:03.312
LAURA: I don't think you would benefit from this.

03:41:03.312 --> 03:41:03.994
TRAVIS: You're on the floor, right?

03:41:03.994 --> 03:41:04.569
LAURA: Yeah.

03:41:04.569 --> 03:41:07.531
TALIESIN: You want heavy in combat, so you would
want--

03:41:07.531 --> 03:41:11.857
SAM: I have explosive arrows, but I don't think
they'll work underwater.

03:41:11.857 --> 03:41:14.764
MARISHA: How far up are Yasha and I from the
floor?

03:41:14.764 --> 03:41:18.323
MATT: You are about 50 or so feet, let's say. If
you want to get closer.

03:41:18.323 --> 03:41:19.555
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:41:19.555 --> 03:41:25.454
MARISHA: Yeah, we'll drop down and join Jester and
co.

03:41:25.454 --> 03:41:31.084
SAM: Before we mount this attack, I'm going to
swim up to Caleb and say: I'm glad you forgot

03:41:31.084 --> 03:41:35.932
about us before, it means you're thinking about
them, but I won't stop thinking about you and I'll

03:41:35.932 --> 03:41:41.583
give him one of the healing potions. Take this.

03:41:41.583 --> 03:41:58.442
LAURA: Are we about to do this now? I'm going to
Bless, taking a cue from Caduceus, on Yasha, Beau,

03:41:58.442 --> 03:42:00.138
and Fjord.

03:42:00.138 --> 03:42:01.141
MARISHA: Thanks, friend.

03:42:01.141 --> 03:42:02.109
TRAVIS: What's that do again?

03:42:02.109 --> 03:42:06.624
LAURA: That gives you a d4 to add to your attack
rolls and saving throws.

03:42:06.624 --> 03:42:07.782
TRAVIS: Got it.

03:42:07.782 --> 03:42:09.903
MATT: Mark down your Bless.

03:42:09.903 --> 03:42:12.518
TALIESIN: Right as it begins.

03:42:12.518 --> 03:42:17.615
MATT: All right. Is everyone gathering on the
floor?

03:42:17.615 --> 03:42:19.092
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:42:19.092 --> 03:42:25.389
MATT: You've all descended down to the floor of
the ocean about roughly 50, 60 feet from this open

03:42:25.389 --> 03:42:33.255
doorway that leads inside the temple. As you have
your spells prepared, ready to delve inside, you

03:42:33.255 --> 03:42:43.103
take a breath of the deep ocean water in your
lungs and exhale its thick, cold liquid and steel

03:42:43.103 --> 03:42:45.551
yourself for us to pick up in the new year.

03:42:45.551 --> 03:42:47.669
MARISHA: I knew it!

03:42:47.669 --> 03:42:53.706
TRAVIS: Fuck. Did that Accursed Specter do any
damage?

03:42:53.706 --> 03:42:56.374
MATT: Oh, no, it did some.

03:42:56.374 --> 03:42:59.454
TRAVIS: Oh good, okay! Good job, Carl.

03:42:59.454 --> 03:43:04.567
LAURA: I'm picturing those big creatures that are
in The Dark Crystal. You know what I'm talking about?

03:43:04.818 --> 03:43:05.989
MATT: That's what you saw.

03:43:05.989 --> 03:43:08.035
LAURA: Oh fuck, that's way scarier--

03:43:08.035 --> 03:43:09.204
TALIESIN: Hey! Look at that!

03:43:09.204 --> 03:43:10.249
TRAVIS: What is that?

03:43:10.249 --> 03:43:12.083
MATT: That's what you'll get to see next week.

03:43:12.083 --> 03:43:14.069
TALIESIN: Well, not next week.

03:43:14.069 --> 03:43:18.255
MATT: Or no, sorry, in three weeks. Next year.

03:43:18.255 --> 03:43:21.560
TRAVIS: Put seahorses instead.

03:43:21.560 --> 03:43:23.522
LAURA: What date are we starting back up again?

03:43:23.522 --> 03:43:24.653
MATT: The 10th I think?

03:43:24.653 --> 03:43:26.446
LAURA and TALIESIN: The 10th.

03:43:26.446 --> 03:43:27.933
MATT: I believe it's the 10th.

03:43:27.933 --> 03:43:30.123
LAURA: Oh man.

03:43:30.123 --> 03:43:33.060
MATT: All righty, we'll pick up for that. Ah!

03:43:33.060 --> 03:43:35.482
TRAVIS: Oh shit, I'm excited!

03:43:35.482 --> 03:43:37.744
TALIESIN: Bless! Oh, I love Bless.

03:43:37.744 --> 03:43:39.955
LAURA: Oh my goodness. Yeah, that's cool.

03:43:39.955 --> 03:43:40.962
TALIESIN: Bless and Bane, man.

03:43:40.962 --> 03:43:42.674
MATT: Bless and Bane. Two underappreciated
spells.

03:43:42.674 --> 03:43:43.713
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:43:43.713 --> 03:43:52.665
MATT: It's too much of that expression, Sam,
tonight. It's been glaring at me the entire time.

03:43:52.665 --> 03:43:54.670
TRAVIS: Look at that forked tongue.

03:43:54.670 --> 03:43:57.595
TALIESIN: Yeah, are we going to talk about the
Riegel in the room?

03:43:57.595 --> 03:44:00.025
LAURA: Ooh, it does look like a forked tongue.
What the fuck is going on?

03:44:00.025 --> 03:44:01.309
SAM: I'm half-devil.

03:44:01.309 --> 03:44:06.231
TALIESIN: How do you have a dimple-- you have a
movie star chin dimple. It's right there.

03:44:06.231 --> 03:44:08.707
TRAVIS: You got ass-tongue.

03:44:08.707 --> 03:44:13.167
TALIESIN: The tongue is saving a woman tied to a
railroad track.

03:44:13.167 --> 03:44:15.495
TRAVIS: The baby's butt coming out of your mouth.

03:44:15.495 --> 03:44:17.345
LIAM: Yeah. It's a front-bottom.

03:44:17.345 --> 03:44:19.144
MATT: Well guys. Thank you so much.

03:44:19.144 --> 03:44:20.835
TRAVIS: Thank you, Matt!

03:44:20.835 --> 03:44:22.195
MATT: Ashley, I missed having you here.

03:44:22.195 --> 03:44:25.774
ASHLEY: This is so fun.

03:44:25.774 --> 03:44:27.481
TALIESIN: We missed you so much!

03:44:27.481 --> 03:44:28.292
ASHLEY: Oh gosh.

03:44:28.292 --> 03:44:29.863
TRAVIS: What a great 2018, guys.

03:44:29.863 --> 03:44:31.484
ASHLEY: Hey, what a great 2018!

03:44:31.484 --> 03:44:36.590
MATT: Not a bad year. A stressful and crazy year,
but a very good year.

03:44:36.590 --> 03:44:39.206
LAURA: Sleep for a hundred years.

03:44:39.206 --> 03:44:40.945
TRAVIS: Yeah, seriously.

03:44:40.945 --> 03:44:43.276
MARISHA: Weeks of sleep.

03:44:43.276 --> 03:44:44.297
MATT: We'll be back in a few weeks.

03:44:44.297 --> 03:44:45.527
TRAVIS: Stay tuned for tomorrow night for
Liam's--

03:44:45.527 --> 03:44:46.792
MATT: Yeah, for Liam's one-shot!

03:44:46.792 --> 03:44:48.451
LIAM: The madness.

03:44:48.451 --> 03:44:50.672
ASHLEY: It was the best.

03:44:50.672 --> 03:44:51.752
LIAM: Oh my god.

03:44:51.752 --> 03:44:52.851
TALIESIN: Still littered with candy canes.

03:44:52.851 --> 03:44:53.713
LAURA: I love you, guys!

03:44:53.713 --> 03:44:54.894
MATT: Love you guys.

03:44:54.894 --> 03:44:56.295
LAURA: Love you every year together.

03:44:56.295 --> 03:45:01.461
ALL: Merry Christmas.

03:45:01.461 --> 03:45:06.323
MATT: Merry Christmas. Happy holidays. Happy
holidays to you guys. Man, we're going to miss

03:45:06.323 --> 03:45:10.713
you, but we'll be back soon! We'll keep tabs;
we'll see you on the internet. In the meantime--

03:45:10.713 --> 03:45:16.443
MARISHA: Merry Christmas!

03:45:16.443 --> 03:45:18.420
MATT: That's my wife, ladies and gentlemen.

03:45:18.420 --> 03:45:21.469
TRAVIS: Boof!

03:45:21.469 --> 03:45:22.778
LIAM: That was my wife.

03:45:22.778 --> 03:45:24.927
MARISHA: Merry Christmas.

03:45:25.527 --> 03:45:27.616
LAURA: And a Happy New Year!

03:45:27.616 --> 03:45:34.427
MATT: I know. We'll see you guys in the new year.
Enjoy. Know we love you very much and is it

03:45:34.427 --> 03:45:40.793
Thursday in three weeks yet? Good night. Happy
holidays, Happy New Year!

MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to
tonight's episode of Critical Role,

00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:04.032

00:00:04.032 --> 00:00:05.503
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

and I slowly bleed from one nostril

00:00:16.255 --> 00:00:19.447
from whatever that wall of sound was,

00:00:19.447 --> 00:00:21.185

00:03:43.872 --> 00:03:45.732

MATT: Great, and Laura,

00:03:48.604 --> 00:03:49.915
you had some things you wanted to mention as well.

00:03:49.915 --> 00:03:53.452
LAURA: I did! I have-- it's specific.

00:03:53.452 --> 00:03:56.553
Keep an eye on our social media accounts,

00:03:56.553 --> 00:03:59.963
and check out our US, UK, and Australia stores

00:03:59.963 --> 00:04:01.291

00:04:01.291 --> 00:04:04.044
I think there's new stuff in there, I'm not sure.

00:04:04.044 --> 00:04:05.662
You can sign up for our newsletter

00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:08.130
to stay updated on all our recent merch launches.

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.621
Are they doing this because

00:04:09.621 --> 00:04:11.484
I'm not doing very good job announcing our stuff?

00:04:11.484 --> 00:04:13.043
I don't know, but we're saying this now.

00:04:13.043 --> 00:04:14.380
(laughter)

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.054
Yeah, sign up for our merch.

00:04:16.054 --> 00:04:18.720
No, nope, sign up for our newsletter.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.053
Cool announcements,

00:04:20.053 --> 00:04:24.241
critrole.com/newsletter.

00:04:24.241 --> 00:04:29.089
SAM: Did they tell you, like,
you got to stick to the script?

00:04:29.089 --> 00:04:31.376
LAURA: They didn't tell me that. But--

00:04:31.376 --> 00:04:32.674
MARISHA: They just took away her script.

00:04:32.674 --> 00:04:36.734
LAURA: They just took--
(laughter)

00:04:36.734 --> 00:04:37.855
No, they didn't do that!

00:04:37.855 --> 00:04:40.107
Because I love holding up the stuff!

00:04:40.107 --> 00:04:42.243
I'm still going to hold up stuff.

00:04:42.243 --> 00:04:45.474
This is just-- this is just right now, because, you know.

00:04:45.474 --> 00:04:46.599
TRAVIS: "This is just right now."

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:47.810
LAURA: Who knows what's in the store right now?

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.702
Things are coming in like crazy time. It's crazy.

00:04:50.702 --> 00:04:52.460
(laughter)

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.132
Don't look at me anymore. Look-- Matt!

00:04:55.132 --> 00:04:56.854
MATT: Thank you, Laura. I got you.

00:04:56.854 --> 00:04:58.478
LIAM: Remember, when times are tough:

00:04:58.478 --> 00:05:00.127
This is just right now.

00:05:00.127 --> 00:05:01.124
TRAVIS: This is just right now.

00:05:01.124 --> 00:05:02.894
MATT: This is just right now.

00:05:02.894 --> 00:05:05.614
All right, I believe that concludes our announcements.

00:05:05.614 --> 00:05:07.297
MARISHA: Oh good.
MATT: So.

(dragon roaring)

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:54.109
MATT: Welcome back. So last we left off: The Mighty Nein,

00:06:54.109 --> 00:06:57.535
following and now slightly ahead of the tracks

00:06:57.535 --> 00:06:58.818
of Lucien and the Tomb Takers,

00:06:58.818 --> 00:07:01.118
making their way from place to place across

00:07:01.118 --> 00:07:03.438
Foren in Eiselcross,

00:07:03.438 --> 00:07:05.698
seeking elements they're gathering

00:07:05.698 --> 00:07:08.877
before eventually heading towards the central Aeorian ruins

00:07:08.877 --> 00:07:10.698
on this portion of the region.

00:07:10.698 --> 00:07:14.817
You delve into your second Aeorian ruin,

00:07:14.817 --> 00:07:17.323
located as A2 on the map that you were given

00:07:17.323 --> 00:07:20.268
by the late Lady Vess DeRogna.

00:07:20.268 --> 00:07:23.636
You made a small friend, one outlier,

00:07:23.636 --> 00:07:25.737
who had already gone into this ruin,

00:07:25.737 --> 00:07:29.007
but the rest of his group had not returned in days.

00:07:29.007 --> 00:07:31.045
Leaving him to fend for himself in the shadow,

00:07:31.045 --> 00:07:34.716
you began to explore aspects of this particular excavation.

00:07:34.716 --> 00:07:38.366
You found a terribly ruined street,

00:07:38.366 --> 00:07:40.847
and it looked like a arcane dome;

00:07:40.847 --> 00:07:43.628
sealed within, Aeorian citizens,

00:07:43.628 --> 00:07:47.028
still frozen in those moments of cataclysm.

00:07:47.028 --> 00:07:48.938
Then, following your spell,

00:07:48.938 --> 00:07:51.348
locating a directional blip

00:07:51.348 --> 00:07:56.338
towards a possible threshold crest within these ruins,

00:07:56.338 --> 00:07:58.397
you went and eventually discovered the entrance

00:07:58.397 --> 00:08:00.792
to some sort of Aeorian laboratory,

00:08:00.792 --> 00:08:05.072
which was covered in shattered glass and fallen implements,

00:08:05.072 --> 00:08:08.083
and with some spell help through Caleb,

00:08:08.083 --> 00:08:10.923
able to ascertain some of these ancient language bits

00:08:10.923 --> 00:08:12.381
that were previously misunderstood--

00:08:12.381 --> 00:08:15.931
or not understood by any of you.

00:08:15.931 --> 00:08:18.493
You managed to fix one of the doors

00:08:18.493 --> 00:08:20.552
and hit one of the

00:08:20.552 --> 00:08:25.051
arcane-based button prompts on a nearby pedestal,

00:08:25.051 --> 00:08:28.664
causing the door behind you to slam shut and a door ahead,

00:08:28.664 --> 00:08:30.944
where you were planning to go, to open up.

00:08:30.944 --> 00:08:35.901
Where a horrible, baneful cry,

00:08:35.901 --> 00:08:38.352
began to echo through the chamber.

00:08:38.352 --> 00:08:41.381
Snuffing the light and hiding amongst the room,

00:08:41.381 --> 00:08:46.320
you all watched as a terrifying beast began to lumber in.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:50.240
Its strange, somewhat muscular, but sagging,

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.709
elephant-like body, helming the front,

00:08:53.709 --> 00:08:58.476
a smooth, slick, cherub-like,

00:08:58.476 --> 00:09:01.571
bulbous human baby face in the front,

00:09:01.571 --> 00:09:04.789
clouded over pupil-less eyes,

00:09:04.789 --> 00:09:08.840
a mouth that split open in the center, filled with teeth,

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.211
as numerous human arms, small,

00:09:11.211 --> 00:09:13.639
reached out for whatever was nearby the front

00:09:13.639 --> 00:09:15.978
of its toothy maw.

00:09:15.978 --> 00:09:18.927
(laughter)
MARISHA: Own it!

00:09:18.927 --> 00:09:20.418
MATT: Out the front of its forehead,

00:09:20.418 --> 00:09:24.090
you saw dangling a tendril of some kind.

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:25.909
At the end, a bulb of glowing light

00:09:25.909 --> 00:09:28.719
that swung as it entered,

00:09:28.719 --> 00:09:30.904
and as it began to step into the chamber--

00:09:30.904 --> 00:09:32.642
LAURA: Rancor it.

00:09:32.642 --> 00:09:33.475
MATT: What's up?

00:09:33.475 --> 00:09:35.429
LAURA: I want to Rancor it.

00:09:35.429 --> 00:09:36.423
Slam the door down on it.

00:09:36.423 --> 00:09:37.343
TALIESIN: Yeah, Rancor it.

00:09:37.343 --> 00:09:38.372
MATT: Okay.

00:09:38.372 --> 00:09:42.769
So I guess that'll be what kicks off initiative, then.

00:09:42.769 --> 00:09:44.662
SAM and MARISHA: Yeah.

00:09:44.662 --> 00:09:45.495
MATT: So Jester.

00:09:45.495 --> 00:09:47.499
TRAVIS: We're not talking to it?

00:09:47.499 --> 00:09:48.727
LAURA: I don't think we're talking to it.

00:09:48.727 --> 00:09:50.455
ASHLEY: But it's a baby.

00:09:50.455 --> 00:09:51.823
LAURA: No, it's not a baby.
ASHLEY: I know.

00:09:51.823 --> 00:09:55.680
LAURA: It's got giant human arms
coming out of his face, too.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.273
MATT: You hit the button

00:09:57.273 --> 00:09:59.609
and the door behind you

00:09:59.609 --> 00:10:01.142
(creaking)

00:10:02.308 --> 00:10:04.265
The other door does not close.

00:10:04.265 --> 00:10:05.098
SAM: What?

00:10:05.098 --> 00:10:08.272
MATT: When it slammed shut it,
dislodged again from its mooring,

00:10:08.272 --> 00:10:11.185
how you had to fix it to put it back inside,

00:10:11.185 --> 00:10:15.242
when it fell it once again, it managed to get itself wedged.

00:10:15.242 --> 00:10:16.283
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

00:10:16.283 --> 00:10:21.196
MATT: So as you hit the button--
LAURA: We have to fix it before we can

00:10:21.196 --> 00:10:23.586
MATT: -- you hear the (door creak)

00:10:23.586 --> 00:10:25.583
on the backside and the creature suddenly

00:10:25.583 --> 00:10:26.761
(grunting)

00:10:26.761 --> 00:10:28.083
glances in your direction.

00:10:28.083 --> 00:10:29.335
I need you all to roll for initiative.

00:10:29.335 --> 00:10:30.843
(yelling)

00:10:30.843 --> 00:10:32.325
TRAVIS: Oh spicy baby.

00:10:32.325 --> 00:10:33.541
LIAM: There's no cheat code for this.

00:10:33.541 --> 00:10:35.361
Someone's going to die.

00:10:35.361 --> 00:10:37.232
MATT: No cheat code.
TALIESIN: I don't like that.

00:10:37.232 --> 00:10:38.573
LIAM: Shit.
TRAVIS: What the fuck?

00:10:38.573 --> 00:10:40.228
LIAM: Damn it.
TRAVIS: Oh, it's not bad.

00:10:40.228 --> 00:10:42.184
LIAM: I hate rolling high initiative.

00:10:42.184 --> 00:10:43.792
TRAVIS: My initiative sucked in this campaign.

00:10:43.792 --> 00:10:45.617
MATT: All righty, so.
TRAVIS: I miss Grog.

00:10:45.617 --> 00:10:46.612
MATT: 25 to 20?

00:10:46.612 --> 00:10:47.987
MARISHA: 21.
TALIESIN: 21.

00:10:47.987 --> 00:10:49.753
LAURA: Ooh. Oh no.

00:10:49.753 --> 00:10:50.586
LIAM: 20.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.166
ASHLEY: 20 for me as well.

00:10:53.166 --> 00:10:54.646
TRAVIS: Caduceus at the top?

00:10:54.646 --> 00:10:55.565
LAURA: Caduceus and Beau.

00:10:55.565 --> 00:10:56.931
So probably Beau then Caduceus.
MATT: What'd you get, Caleb?

00:10:56.931 --> 00:10:57.972
LIAM: 20.

00:10:57.972 --> 00:10:58.925
MATT: Okay, so 20 and--

00:10:58.925 --> 00:11:00.618
ASHLEY: I rolled a natural 20.

00:11:00.618 --> 00:11:03.008
MATT: Plus?
ASHLEY: Plus three, so 23.

00:11:03.008 --> 00:11:04.683
MATT: Oh, so.

00:11:04.683 --> 00:11:06.264
TRAVIS: Yasha's at the top.

00:11:06.264 --> 00:11:07.101
ASHLEY: I'm going first.

00:11:07.101 --> 00:11:07.934
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:11:07.934 --> 00:11:08.907
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:11:08.907 --> 00:11:10.458
MARISHA: She rocks.

00:11:10.458 --> 00:11:12.048
MATT: All righty.

00:11:12.048 --> 00:11:13.624
20 to 15.

00:11:13.624 --> 00:11:14.675
LAURA: Oh, 18.

00:11:14.675 --> 00:11:16.065
MATT: 18 for Jester. There we are.

00:11:16.065 --> 00:11:17.507
TALIESIN: We are top loaded.

00:11:17.507 --> 00:11:19.417
SAM: ♪ (sings with music) ♪

00:11:19.417 --> 00:11:20.307
MATT: 15 to 10.

00:11:20.307 --> 00:11:21.857
TRAVIS: 14.
MATT: 14.

00:11:22.873 --> 00:11:24.198
ASHLEY: Oh boy.

00:11:24.198 --> 00:11:25.031
SAM: Oh boy.

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:28.664
MATT: 10 to five?

00:11:28.664 --> 00:11:29.497
SAM: Eight.

00:11:31.454 --> 00:11:34.323
MATT: All right, holding up the rear there, we have Veth.

00:11:34.323 --> 00:11:37.072
TRAVIS: So Yasha, Beau, Caduceus, Caleb, right?

00:11:37.072 --> 00:11:38.262
LAURA: Yasha, Beau, Caduceus, Caleb

00:11:38.262 --> 00:11:39.382
Jester, Fjord, Veth.

00:11:39.382 --> 00:11:40.215
MATT: Correct.
MARISHA: Me and you

00:11:40.215 --> 00:11:41.763
are both flanking the door, right?

00:11:41.763 --> 00:11:42.596
ASHLEY: Yes.

00:11:42.596 --> 00:11:43.429
MARISHA: Yeah, dope.

00:11:43.429 --> 00:11:45.222
MATT: Yasha, you are up first.
ASHLEY: Sentinel bitches.

00:11:45.222 --> 00:11:46.175
MARISHA: Sentinel bitches.

00:11:46.175 --> 00:11:47.183
MATT: So.
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:11:47.183 --> 00:11:49.730
MATT: As you stand there, as it enters the space,

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:51.080
you look over towards it.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.988
Make a wisdom saving throw for me.

00:11:52.988 --> 00:11:54.874
LAURA: Just from looking at it?

00:11:54.874 --> 00:11:56.445
TRAVIS: Oh fuck.

00:11:56.445 --> 00:11:58.195
SAM: It's a bad--
ASHLEY: Oh no!

00:12:00.141 --> 00:12:00.974
10.

00:12:00.974 --> 00:12:02.085
LIAM: Shit.
MATT: 10.

00:12:02.085 --> 00:12:04.710
With your weapon ready, as it comes in, you glance over,

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:06.284
and as the light of the lure hits your eyes,

00:12:06.284 --> 00:12:08.360
your arms fall.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:11.423
SAM: But you had initiative and she was-- aww.

00:12:11.423 --> 00:12:13.431
ASHLEY: It's okay, it okay. I mean, it's a thing.

00:12:13.431 --> 00:12:16.857
MATT: You watch your-- you move
half your movement towards it.

00:12:16.857 --> 00:12:19.575
TRAVIS: (gasps) (loud scream)

00:12:19.575 --> 00:12:23.838
This is real bad! This is real bad!

00:12:23.838 --> 00:12:26.126
MATT: And you are stunned until the start of your next turn.

00:12:26.126 --> 00:12:27.363
LAURA: Oh no, oh no, oh no.

00:12:27.363 --> 00:12:29.084
MATT: You guys watch as Yasha just walks out

00:12:29.084 --> 00:12:31.979
just dragging the weapon behind her, looking up at the lure.

00:12:31.979 --> 00:12:33.055
and just stands there.

00:12:33.055 --> 00:12:35.015
LAURA: We got to fix Yasha's brain.

00:12:35.015 --> 00:12:36.795
LIAM: It's going to eat her like a hoagie.

00:12:36.795 --> 00:12:39.767
SAM: How many times have you been possessed?
MARISHA: Beauregard, start of your turn,

00:12:39.767 --> 00:12:41.073
make a wisdom saving throw.

00:12:41.073 --> 00:12:42.290
MARISHA: Oh yikes!

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:43.915
ASHLEY: -- it's just a stupid wisdom!

00:12:43.915 --> 00:12:45.092
LAURA: Did you do it, too?

00:12:45.092 --> 00:12:47.195
MARISHA: Oh yeah, he's said started my turn

00:12:47.195 --> 00:12:48.028
I make it.
TRAVIS: Matthew!

00:12:48.028 --> 00:12:49.634
MATT: Yeah, as you look over towards it,

00:12:49.634 --> 00:12:50.900
and begin to see Yasha walk,

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:54.807
you look over at the lure.
TRAVIS: You need a hug.

00:12:54.807 --> 00:12:57.059
ASHLEY: Oh no.
TRAVIS: Say it. Say it.

00:12:57.059 --> 00:12:57.892
MARISHA: That is

00:12:59.135 --> 00:13:00.606
going to be eight total.

00:13:00.606 --> 00:13:01.847
LIAM: Oh!
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

00:13:01.847 --> 00:13:03.649
MATT: You look over and see this happening to Yasha,

00:13:03.649 --> 00:13:05.828
and you begin to dart outward to help her

00:13:05.828 --> 00:13:08.328
and then your eyes catch the light on the end of its lure

00:13:08.328 --> 00:13:09.238
and you also--

00:13:09.238 --> 00:13:11.627
MARISHA: I have good wisdom, too. I just rolled terribly.

00:13:11.627 --> 00:13:13.587
MATT: Yeah, you did.
TRAVIS: Oh my god.

00:13:13.587 --> 00:13:15.445
LAURA: Oh no, what is going to happen?

00:13:15.445 --> 00:13:17.096
Are we all going to die right now?

00:13:17.096 --> 00:13:19.263
SAM: Dagen! Dagen!

00:13:19.263 --> 00:13:20.606
TRAVIS: Shake it up, we got to rattle the cage. Let's go.

00:13:20.606 --> 00:13:22.608
MATT: Caduceus.

00:13:22.608 --> 00:13:23.618
You're up next.

00:13:23.618 --> 00:13:25.184
Caduceus hasn't seen any of this, by the way.

00:13:25.184 --> 00:13:26.575
TALIESIN: No.
SAM: Wait, why?

00:13:26.575 --> 00:13:28.813
LAURA: Because he's behind the wall.
MATT: Because he's behind the wall over that side.

00:13:28.813 --> 00:13:31.654
What are you doing, Caduceus?

00:13:31.654 --> 00:13:33.276
LIAM: Pretty close because the wall between--

00:13:33.276 --> 00:13:34.592
TALIESIN: One second.

00:13:34.592 --> 00:13:35.745
TRAVIS: Oh boy.

00:13:35.745 --> 00:13:38.527
TALIESIN: I was not prepared to be going so soon.

00:13:38.527 --> 00:13:41.037
So I was not quite together with this.

00:13:41.037 --> 00:13:42.328
LIAM: And it's pitch black in here

00:13:42.328 --> 00:13:43.498
other than this thing's eyeball.

00:13:43.498 --> 00:13:44.666
MATT: Other than the light that you can guys

00:13:44.666 --> 00:13:48.098
can see just faintly scatting--

00:13:48.098 --> 00:13:49.770
scattering not scatting.

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:51.743
(laughter)

00:13:51.743 --> 00:13:53.569
Scatting and quiffing a little, if you will.

00:13:53.569 --> 00:13:54.767
(laughter)

00:13:54.767 --> 00:13:56.696
TRAVIS: (farting noises)
MATT: Scattering across the floor,

00:13:56.696 --> 00:13:58.206
you can see it catching the edge of some

00:13:58.206 --> 00:14:00.148
of the rubble and debris on the floor

00:14:00.148 --> 00:14:01.606
across from the edge of the wall,

00:14:01.606 --> 00:14:03.268
but you do not see anything beyond that.

00:14:03.268 --> 00:14:04.737
A couple of shadows that stretch across

00:14:04.737 --> 00:14:06.004
as your teammates move.

00:14:06.004 --> 00:14:10.057
TALIESIN: I'm going to stick with my early plan,

00:14:10.057 --> 00:14:13.068
and I'm going to cast Antilife Shell.

00:14:13.068 --> 00:14:15.678
MATT: Antilife Shell, okay.

00:14:15.678 --> 00:14:16.886
TRAVIS: Oh man.

00:14:16.886 --> 00:14:19.587
LAURA: Oh god, oh god, I'm terrified right now.

00:14:19.587 --> 00:14:23.128
LIAM: Is that light dim light or bright light?

00:14:23.128 --> 00:14:24.286
MATT: Huh?
LIAM: From the baby?

00:14:24.286 --> 00:14:27.201
MATT: From the baby, it is a bright light

00:14:27.201 --> 00:14:30.442
within 15 feet and dim light within 30.

00:14:30.442 --> 00:14:32.321
LIAM and LAURA: Okay.
TRAVIS: Dude, this is a problem.

00:14:32.321 --> 00:14:34.547
ASHLEY: So glad I rolled a natural 20 on initiative

00:14:34.547 --> 00:14:37.722
where it doesn't mean anything.
MATT: I'm so sorry.

00:14:37.722 --> 00:14:39.233
ASHLEY: (frustrated noise)

00:14:39.233 --> 00:14:40.959
MATT: It's a 10-foot radius, you said?

00:14:40.959 --> 00:14:42.671
TALIESIN: It's 10-foot radius.

00:14:42.671 --> 00:14:43.754
MATT: I will say--

00:14:44.807 --> 00:14:47.186
this'll be your shell.

00:14:47.186 --> 00:14:49.287
So that'll be your antilife shell there.

00:14:49.287 --> 00:14:50.862
TALIESIN: Cool.
LAURA: Ooh, cool.

00:14:50.862 --> 00:14:53.562
TALIESIN: I was going to go invisible and look around the--

00:14:53.562 --> 00:14:55.053
Well, I was going to start moving around the corner,

00:14:55.053 --> 00:14:56.756
but I suppose I'm going to turn around the--

00:14:56.756 --> 00:14:58.407
I'm going to keep my distance

00:14:58.407 --> 00:15:00.360
and see what the hell is going on.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.837
TRAVIS: Does it move with you or does it stay in one place?

00:15:01.837 --> 00:15:04.068
TALIESIN: It moves with me.
TRAVIS: Great.

00:15:04.068 --> 00:15:06.501
TALIESIN: I mean, I was not going to head towards it,

00:15:06.501 --> 00:15:08.080
I was just going to keep distance--

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.215
MATT: Where do you want to go?

00:15:09.215 --> 00:15:11.698
TALIESIN: Like towards the stairs just to look,

00:15:11.698 --> 00:15:12.841
TRAVIS: Should he look at it--
TALIESIN: And what do I see?

00:15:12.841 --> 00:15:13.674
TRAVIS: -- that's not bad.

00:15:13.674 --> 00:15:15.465
Move that fucking payload towards it.
MATT: There, as soon as you get to that point,

00:15:15.465 --> 00:15:16.559
which you are now invisible,

00:15:16.559 --> 00:15:18.662
but with your antilife shell around you,

00:15:18.662 --> 00:15:20.527
you just move to the side.

00:15:20.527 --> 00:15:23.339
You can see the light on the edge there,

00:15:23.339 --> 00:15:25.968
and you see both Yasha and Beauregard,

00:15:25.968 --> 00:15:27.089
just staring up.

00:15:27.089 --> 00:15:28.325
TALIESIN: Oh shit.
MATT: Like, right in front of it,

00:15:28.325 --> 00:15:31.173
as its mouth is like, (growling).

00:15:31.173 --> 00:15:33.540
So that's your action, that's your most of your move,

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:36.601
you still have five feet there.

00:15:36.601 --> 00:15:39.830
TALIESIN: I'm going to back up five feet.

00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:40.663
MATT: Okay.

00:15:40.663 --> 00:15:41.496
TALIESIN: And

00:15:42.855 --> 00:15:45.188
tell Caleb what I saw.

00:15:46.303 --> 00:15:48.098
They're out of it, it's moving towards us,

00:15:48.098 --> 00:15:51.397
it did something. I don't know.

00:15:51.397 --> 00:15:53.170
MATT: And with that, it's your turn, Caleb.

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:54.278
LIAM: (stammering)

00:15:54.278 --> 00:15:55.220
MATT: Jester, you're on deck.

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:56.158
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

00:15:56.158 --> 00:16:00.109
LIAM: Caleb just stammers
for the first five of his six seconds

00:16:00.109 --> 00:16:04.735
and then lights up the driftglobe with the Daylight spell.

00:16:04.735 --> 00:16:06.528
MATT: Okay. All right.

00:16:06.528 --> 00:16:08.825
So light begins to fill the chamber around

00:16:08.825 --> 00:16:10.935
so now you have a much better view

00:16:10.935 --> 00:16:12.303
and anybody else who does not have darkvision

00:16:12.303 --> 00:16:14.188
has a much better view of the entirety of this room.

00:16:14.188 --> 00:16:16.688
LIAM: Bright-bright, it's daylight.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.956
And I will

00:16:21.866 --> 00:16:23.127
scooch forward a little bit,

00:16:23.127 --> 00:16:24.818
even though I can't see him anymore.

00:16:24.818 --> 00:16:28.146
A little bit like Caduceus did so that I can try to--

00:16:28.146 --> 00:16:31.472
Yeah, I'll move straight forward.

00:16:31.472 --> 00:16:32.305
MATT: Okay.

00:16:33.784 --> 00:16:34.727
How far?

00:16:34.727 --> 00:16:36.051
LIAM: I'd be in that bubble, I think.

00:16:36.051 --> 00:16:38.973
That's as far as I would need to go to see,

00:16:38.973 --> 00:16:40.034
to peek to the left

00:16:40.034 --> 00:16:43.232
and once I saw Beauregard and Yasha, I would stop.

00:16:43.232 --> 00:16:44.638
MATT: About there is where you would see them.

00:16:44.638 --> 00:16:46.456
LIAM: Yeah, I will stop right there.

00:16:46.456 --> 00:16:47.650
MATT: Okay.

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:50.859
You got it.
LIAM: Oh boy.

00:16:50.859 --> 00:16:53.499
TRAVIS: Yep. Well, we're in it, let's go.

00:16:53.499 --> 00:16:54.332
Here we go.

00:16:54.332 --> 00:16:55.895
MARISHA: This is the second fight in a row that the--

00:16:55.895 --> 00:16:56.760
MATT: So that's your movement.

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:58.300
MARISHA: -- melee people have biffed it.

00:16:58.300 --> 00:16:59.989
MATT: And the action would be the globe, that's right.

00:16:59.989 --> 00:17:00.822
So yeah.
MARISHA: And the clerics had

00:17:00.822 --> 00:17:02.623
to save our ass.
ASHLEY: It's super fun.

00:17:02.623 --> 00:17:03.947
MATT: Jester, you're up.
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:17:03.947 --> 00:17:04.780
LAURA: Okay.

00:17:06.167 --> 00:17:10.584
I'm going to have my duplicate step right up to baby.

00:17:11.638 --> 00:17:12.596
MATT: All righty.

00:17:12.596 --> 00:17:13.685
SAM: Baby dupes.

00:17:18.817 --> 00:17:19.984
LAURA: Touch it and

00:17:21.416 --> 00:17:24.532
cast Inflict Wounds at 6th-level.

00:17:24.532 --> 00:17:27.523
MATT: Roll for an attack. 6th-level, yeah!

00:17:27.523 --> 00:17:28.356
LIAM: Yep.

00:17:31.915 --> 00:17:32.748
MARISHA: Oh no.

00:17:32.748 --> 00:17:33.856
TRAVIS: Say it.
MARISHA: No, no, no.

00:17:33.856 --> 00:17:36.053
LAURA: Natural 20.

00:17:36.053 --> 00:17:39.402
SAM: No, no. Bad.
TRAVIS: Could be bad.

00:17:39.402 --> 00:17:40.551
SAM: Well, there's magic stuff.

00:17:40.551 --> 00:17:41.384
MATT: Well, here's the thing.

00:17:41.384 --> 00:17:44.226
Here's the thing, here's the thing.

00:17:44.226 --> 00:17:46.677
First off, it is a spell with an attack roll,

00:17:46.677 --> 00:17:48.231
which means natural 20 does double damage.

00:17:48.231 --> 00:17:49.064
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:17:50.027 --> 00:17:54.135
MATT: So, on top of that, I need you to roll a d100 for me.

00:17:54.135 --> 00:17:56.171
So roll 2d10.

00:17:56.171 --> 00:17:58.564
LIAM: It's going to be random-- this is Wild Magic shit.

00:17:58.564 --> 00:17:59.922
TALIESIN: Side effects are going to happen.

00:17:59.922 --> 00:18:01.410
LIAM: Yep, could be good, could be bad.

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:02.330
MARISHA: Please be good.

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:03.163
LIAM: It's a slot machine.

00:18:03.163 --> 00:18:06.413
TRAVIS: (fingers snap)
LIAM: (slot machine ticking)

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.011
LAURA: Well, wait, hold on,
because I don't know which is which.

00:18:10.011 --> 00:18:11.896
So I'm going to reroll and roll,

00:18:11.896 --> 00:18:13.329
like, a percentile, yeah.

00:18:13.329 --> 00:18:15.922
MATT: Yeah, percentile die.

00:18:15.922 --> 00:18:17.569
LAURA: 63.

00:18:17.569 --> 00:18:18.402
MATT: 63,

00:18:19.243 --> 00:18:20.739
all right.

00:18:20.739 --> 00:18:22.105
So I'll explain what happens.

00:18:22.105 --> 00:18:23.186
So go ahead and roll damage for that.

00:18:23.186 --> 00:18:25.679
Because the spell goes through.

00:18:25.679 --> 00:18:27.304
You reach out with your--

00:18:27.304 --> 00:18:31.131
I'll say your illusionary duplicate
reaches out and touches it.

00:18:31.131 --> 00:18:32.491
You watch as its hand reaches out,

00:18:32.491 --> 00:18:34.267
the magical energy gathers around your hand,

00:18:34.267 --> 00:18:37.323
and then at the same time mirrors on your duplicate.

00:18:37.323 --> 00:18:39.954
And as it touches, it vanishes from your arm and instead

00:18:39.954 --> 00:18:41.939
(whooshing) spikes to the body of this creature.

00:18:41.939 --> 00:18:45.747
You watch as these dark black and purple

00:18:45.747 --> 00:18:47.634
almost like bolts of lightning arc begin to through

00:18:47.634 --> 00:18:49.992
and as it does, you watch skin and flesh begin to split

00:18:49.992 --> 00:18:52.391
as it just works its way up its body.

00:18:52.391 --> 00:18:53.518
LAURA: Okay.
MARISHA: Roll high.

00:18:53.518 --> 00:18:54.572
LAURA: Okay.
MARISHA: Roll high.

00:18:54.572 --> 00:18:56.521
LAURA: Hold on, hold on, I was paying attention to

00:18:56.521 --> 00:18:58.140
what he was saying, so I wasn't rolling.

00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:00.897
MATT: So what's the damage on that? Is it 3d10?

00:19:00.897 --> 00:19:03.507
LAURA: On a level one, so 8d10.

00:19:03.507 --> 00:19:05.220
(howling)

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:06.912
LAURA and MATT: Times two.

00:19:07.878 --> 00:19:08.711
That is

00:19:09.694 --> 00:19:10.844
a lot.

00:19:10.844 --> 00:19:12.902
SAM: That's sick damage.

00:19:12.902 --> 00:19:13.971
LAURA: Nine,

00:19:13.971 --> 00:19:14.804
nine,

00:19:14.804 --> 00:19:15.694
18.

00:19:15.694 --> 00:19:16.527
Nine!

00:19:16.527 --> 00:19:17.619
MATT: (chuckling) Okay.

00:19:17.619 --> 00:19:18.702
LAURA: 27.
MARISHA: Nein!

00:19:20.338 --> 00:19:21.171
TALIESIN: Oh!

00:19:22.802 --> 00:19:24.078
LAURA: Nine.

00:19:24.078 --> 00:19:26.388
35,

00:19:26.388 --> 00:19:28.937
39,

00:19:28.937 --> 00:19:30.348
plus eight is

00:19:30.348 --> 00:19:31.181
40...

00:19:32.401 --> 00:19:33.690
Two.
SAM: Seven.

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:34.523
LAURA: What?

00:19:34.523 --> 00:19:35.674
SAM: 39 plus eight is--

00:19:35.674 --> 00:19:38.996
LAURA: 47, plus six is 50...

00:19:38.996 --> 00:19:40.076
One.

00:19:40.076 --> 00:19:41.584
MARISHA: A hundred!
LAURA: No,

00:19:41.584 --> 00:19:42.642
53.

00:19:42.642 --> 00:19:45.424
MATT: 53, so 106 points of necrotic damage.

00:19:45.424 --> 00:19:46.840
ASHLEY and TRAVIS: Whoa!

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:48.431
TRAVIS: Jester!

00:19:48.431 --> 00:19:50.073
MARISHA and TRAVIS: Holy shit.

00:19:50.932 --> 00:19:52.270
MARISHA: Oh.

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:55.692
MATT: Yeah, wow. (laughs)

00:19:55.692 --> 00:19:57.250
Yeah, so.

00:19:58.561 --> 00:20:01.688
It burrows through its body and you hear it

00:20:01.688 --> 00:20:03.853
(groaning)

00:20:03.853 --> 00:20:05.631
beginning to screech in pain

00:20:05.631 --> 00:20:09.509
as it begins to rear up its hands for a moment,

00:20:09.509 --> 00:20:12.850
and all these magical butterflies begin to just swirl

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:13.766
around it.

00:20:13.766 --> 00:20:14.607
TALIESIN: Oh, thank god.

00:20:14.607 --> 00:20:18.182
MATT: And just add this weirdly beautiful mystique

00:20:18.182 --> 00:20:22.197
to the atmosphere around this horrifying abomination.

00:20:22.197 --> 00:20:25.235
TRAVIS: That's the effect. Okay, okay, okay!

00:20:25.235 --> 00:20:28.095
MARISHA: That is the most Jester thing.

00:20:28.095 --> 00:20:29.075
TRAVIS: Yeah, it is!

00:20:29.075 --> 00:20:31.091
MATT: As soon as you rolled it, I was like,

00:20:31.091 --> 00:20:32.811
"Yeah, that checks out."

00:20:32.811 --> 00:20:33.806
SAM: Wow.

00:20:33.806 --> 00:20:37.904
MARISHA: Inflict deadly, corrosive, necromantic wounds,

00:20:37.904 --> 00:20:40.120
and also butterflies.

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:41.048
MATT: On brand.

00:20:41.048 --> 00:20:42.065
LIAM: But it's a baby.

00:20:42.065 --> 00:20:45.398
MATT: Do you want to move at all on your turn?

00:20:46.259 --> 00:20:47.387
LAURA: Yes, as me,

00:20:47.387 --> 00:20:49.350
my person, I'm going to run

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:51.492
and try to get on the

00:20:52.883 --> 00:20:56.283
other side of the room, like behind Caduceus

00:20:59.503 --> 00:21:01.189
MATT: Six. That's about as far as you can make it.

00:21:01.189 --> 00:21:02.757
LAURA: Yeah, that's about as far as I want.

00:21:02.757 --> 00:21:04.541
LIAM: She died in the attempt.

00:21:04.541 --> 00:21:06.149
LAURA: I'll say on the other side of those stairs,

00:21:06.149 --> 00:21:07.793
I'll do just a straight line. Yeah.

00:21:07.793 --> 00:21:09.018
MATT: Right there?
LAURA: Yeah.

00:21:09.018 --> 00:21:10.054
MATT: There you go.

00:21:10.054 --> 00:21:11.853
That finishes your go, Jester.

00:21:11.853 --> 00:21:13.068
MARISHA: That would it be the worst.

00:21:13.068 --> 00:21:14.126
LAURA: Okay.

00:21:14.126 --> 00:21:16.177
MATT: It is now the creature's turn.

00:21:16.177 --> 00:21:17.010
MARISHA: Trip and fall.

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:19.978
SAM: Watch out, Beau and Yasha.
LIAM: Hit your head on the same.

00:21:19.978 --> 00:21:23.962
ASHLEY: At least we're, like, Sentinel stunned.

00:21:23.962 --> 00:21:25.045
MATT: So.
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:21:26.735 --> 00:21:27.935
ASHLEY: That's not good.

00:21:27.935 --> 00:21:29.163
LAURA: Did have to roll a con s--

00:21:29.163 --> 00:21:31.437
No, it didn't because it's a light source.

00:21:36.165 --> 00:21:39.641
MATT: The creature, at this point,

00:21:39.641 --> 00:21:41.676
after the blast of the impact and pain

00:21:41.676 --> 00:21:44.850
that it takes (growling).

00:21:46.806 --> 00:21:47.847
(retching)

00:21:47.847 --> 00:21:50.462
And you watch his body tenses and wretches.

00:21:50.462 --> 00:21:55.363
And this spray of caustic bile

00:21:55.363 --> 00:21:58.404
goes firing out in front of it.

00:21:58.404 --> 00:21:59.237
LIAM: Oh.

00:22:00.837 --> 00:22:01.670
Spit up.

00:22:04.087 --> 00:22:05.761
ASHLEY: And it just misses us.

00:22:05.761 --> 00:22:06.594
MATT: No.
ASHLEY: I'm just kidding.

00:22:06.594 --> 00:22:08.701
LIAM: It gets right between.

00:22:08.701 --> 00:22:13.701
MATT: I need you both to make a constitution saving throws.

00:22:13.865 --> 00:22:14.765
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:22:14.765 --> 00:22:16.448
LIAM: That's good for Yasha.

00:22:16.448 --> 00:22:17.793
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:22:17.793 --> 00:22:20.626
TRAVIS: It is such a crazy looking mini.

00:22:21.583 --> 00:22:22.416
"Mini."

00:22:22.416 --> 00:22:23.333
LIAM: Beregerd.

00:22:24.405 --> 00:22:26.457
MARISHA: 16. It's okay.

00:22:27.485 --> 00:22:28.980
MATT: 16?

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:31.030
ASHLEY: Same.
MATT: Same?

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:32.177
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:22:32.177 --> 00:22:33.094
MATT: Both fail.

00:22:35.693 --> 00:22:39.561
MARISHA: Yep, yep, yep.
ASHLEY: Cool, cool, cool.

00:22:39.561 --> 00:22:42.786
MATT: You both take 42 points of acid damage

00:22:42.786 --> 00:22:44.956
as you're both just coated,

00:22:44.956 --> 00:22:47.844
and it begins to singe and burn.

00:22:47.844 --> 00:22:50.895
You watch as smoke and steam begin to rise off

00:22:50.895 --> 00:22:54.443
of both Beauregard and Yasha, as their eyes blink

00:22:54.443 --> 00:22:57.167
and you feel yourself, the pain rising up.

00:22:57.167 --> 00:23:00.334
It's also going to begin to move forward,

00:23:01.486 --> 00:23:05.073
and is going to trample past both of you.

00:23:05.073 --> 00:23:06.381
SAM: Whoa.

00:23:07.589 --> 00:23:09.922
LAURA: Oh, you guys can't hit it.

00:23:11.579 --> 00:23:14.180
MATT: Both of you are knocked prone unless you can make--

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:16.608
Oh, you are stunned.

00:23:16.608 --> 00:23:18.678
"Automatically fail strength and dex saving throws,"

00:23:18.678 --> 00:23:20.928
so you're both knocked prone.

00:23:21.838 --> 00:23:24.440
LIAM: Just in the bile on the ground.

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:25.429
MATT: Correct.

00:23:25.429 --> 00:23:26.881
ASHLEY and MARISHA: (sigh)

00:23:26.881 --> 00:23:28.182
MATT: That finishes its turn.

00:23:28.182 --> 00:23:30.023
SAM: Oh.
MATT: All right.

00:23:30.023 --> 00:23:31.827
Fjord, you're up, and Veth, you're on deck.

00:23:31.827 --> 00:23:33.444
TRAVIS: Sure.

00:23:33.444 --> 00:23:35.734
Does it trample into my field of view

00:23:35.734 --> 00:23:36.954
from that wall position?

00:23:36.954 --> 00:23:40.627
MATT: Yes, and between the light source from

00:23:40.627 --> 00:23:43.295
the middle of its lure and the bright,

00:23:43.295 --> 00:23:44.349
daylight source the globe

00:23:44.349 --> 00:23:46.255
that Caleb trotted out there the entire chamber is lit,

00:23:46.255 --> 00:23:50.135
so you have a clean shot on it.

00:23:50.135 --> 00:23:55.130
TRAVIS: Can I use my bonus action to cast Hexblade's Curse?

00:23:56.138 --> 00:23:57.238
MATT: Yes, you may.

00:23:57.238 --> 00:23:59.238
LIAM: I'm going to cast Hexblade's Curse!

00:24:02.534 --> 00:24:03.565
MATT: Hold that for me, if you don't mind.

00:24:03.565 --> 00:24:07.421
TRAVIS: And can I use my movement to try and run

00:24:07.421 --> 00:24:10.637
back towards you and get behind this table.

00:24:11.823 --> 00:24:13.330
MATT: Right there, yeah.
TRAVIS: Yeah, cool.

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:16.985
And I will send three Eldritch Blasts.

00:24:16.985 --> 00:24:18.373
LAURA: Three Eldritch Blasts.

00:24:18.373 --> 00:24:20.014
MATT: Go for it.

00:24:20.014 --> 00:24:21.305
TRAVIS: Jesus.

00:24:23.641 --> 00:24:25.071
That's a 20.

00:24:25.071 --> 00:24:25.904
MATT: 20 hits.

00:24:25.904 --> 00:24:26.904
TRAVIS: All right.

00:24:28.009 --> 00:24:29.519
That is a 29.

00:24:29.519 --> 00:24:30.598
MATT: 29 hits.

00:24:30.598 --> 00:24:32.448
TRAVIS: And a

00:24:32.448 --> 00:24:33.281
six--

00:24:33.281 --> 00:24:34.722
26.

00:24:34.722 --> 00:24:35.555
That hits.

00:24:35.555 --> 00:24:36.888
TRAVIS: Amazing, amazing.

00:24:36.888 --> 00:24:38.639
No 20-- 22, sorry.

00:24:38.639 --> 00:24:40.304
22.
MATT: 22 hits.

00:24:40.304 --> 00:24:41.454
TRAVIS: Okay.
MATT: So three hits,

00:24:41.454 --> 00:24:43.645
go ahead and roll damage.

00:24:43.645 --> 00:24:46.337
ASHLEY: ♪ (sings with background music) ♪

00:24:48.929 --> 00:24:50.771
TRAVIS: 12, 27.

00:24:57.035 --> 00:24:59.262
38 points of force damage.

00:24:59.262 --> 00:25:01.146
MATT: Nice, all righty.

00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.701
So as you jump behind, leap behind the table

00:25:04.701 --> 00:25:07.098
skidding, hearing the sound of stone

00:25:07.098 --> 00:25:08.756
and broken glass shaking off your boots

00:25:08.756 --> 00:25:09.731
and hitting the wall behind you.

00:25:09.731 --> 00:25:10.936
You spin around and throw all three

00:25:10.936 --> 00:25:13.582
of your Eldritch Blasts forward. (whooshing)

00:25:13.582 --> 00:25:15.172
Each time (impacts)

00:25:15.172 --> 00:25:16.560
impacting on the side. With each blast,

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:18.396
it leaves a dark spot and the small crater

00:25:18.396 --> 00:25:22.003
where you can see some of its dark blood pour out the side.

00:25:22.003 --> 00:25:22.836
It takes the hits,

00:25:22.836 --> 00:25:24.421
but right now it's still looking around

00:25:24.421 --> 00:25:27.872
and getting a feel for the environment around it.

00:25:27.872 --> 00:25:28.705
TRAVIS: Cool.

00:25:29.773 --> 00:25:32.350
Yeah, I'll take a knee and just try

00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:36.123
and put as much of my body behind the table.

00:25:36.123 --> 00:25:36.956
MATT: You got it.

00:25:36.956 --> 00:25:39.581
TRAVIS: Just because there's puking terribleness.

00:25:39.581 --> 00:25:41.913
MATT: You got it, all right. Veth, you're up.

00:25:41.913 --> 00:25:43.071
Top of your turn, I need you to

00:25:43.071 --> 00:25:44.257
make a wisdom saving throw for me, please.

00:25:44.257 --> 00:25:45.907
SAM: Oh no.

00:25:45.907 --> 00:25:47.523
How come they didn't have to?
MARISHA: Where are you?

00:25:47.523 --> 00:25:49.542
MATT: Unless you would like to avert your gaze.

00:25:49.542 --> 00:25:50.375
SAM: No, I'm aiming.

00:25:50.375 --> 00:25:51.297
MATT: Okay.

00:25:51.297 --> 00:25:53.009
TRAVIS: If you're within a certain distance from it,

00:25:53.009 --> 00:25:53.966
is that what it is?

00:25:53.966 --> 00:25:54.799
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:25:56.005 --> 00:25:56.838
SAM: You don't--

00:25:56.838 --> 00:25:58.234
MARISHA: Where is Veth?
LAURA: Where is Veth on the board?

00:25:58.234 --> 00:25:59.986
SAM: I'm hiding between a cage, I think.

00:25:59.986 --> 00:26:02.544
MATT: Yeah, you're over here.

00:26:02.544 --> 00:26:03.377
SAM: Yeah.

00:26:03.377 --> 00:26:04.483
I rolled a 10,

00:26:04.483 --> 00:26:08.210
but this is a wisdom saving throw, so that's 16.

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:09.631
MATT: 16, does not make it.

00:26:09.631 --> 00:26:10.464
SAM: Oh.
MATT: Wait, no,

00:26:10.464 --> 00:26:12.391
16 does, you're right, you're good.

00:26:12.391 --> 00:26:13.224
So you're good.

00:26:13.224 --> 00:26:14.724
TRAVIS: Oh boy.

00:26:14.724 --> 00:26:17.753
MATT: Sorry. So yeah, you succeed on the save.

00:26:17.753 --> 00:26:19.824
You feel the draw for second,

00:26:19.824 --> 00:26:22.596
you wince your eyes, and shake it out of your head.

00:26:22.596 --> 00:26:23.459
You're good to go.

00:26:23.459 --> 00:26:26.017
SAM: Then from my hidden position-- I believe I'm hidden.

00:26:26.017 --> 00:26:26.850
MATT: Yes.

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:28.818
SAM: I will shoot and fire.

00:26:28.818 --> 00:26:30.286
MATT: Do it.

00:26:30.286 --> 00:26:32.101
SAM: I roll once.

00:26:32.101 --> 00:26:33.608
And I got an 18 plus a lot.

00:26:33.608 --> 00:26:35.989
So I'm sure that hits,

00:26:35.989 --> 00:26:37.128
29 to hit.

00:26:37.128 --> 00:26:38.128
MATT: That hits.

00:26:39.065 --> 00:26:42.880
SAM: And then-- so this is sneak attack damage.

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:47.339
And, in the previous game, before we wrapped,

00:26:47.339 --> 00:26:50.616
I had said that I had cast Voltaic Bolt.

00:26:50.616 --> 00:26:51.796
MATT: Yes, and had that prepped.

00:26:51.796 --> 00:26:54.555
SAM: So it's all prepped, so.

00:26:54.555 --> 00:26:57.767
Oh, these are all twos, okay.

00:26:57.767 --> 00:27:00.237
MATT: That's okay, just the adds some balance to the

00:27:00.237 --> 00:27:04.320
other spell that does 106 damage in a single round.

00:27:07.215 --> 00:27:08.798
SAM: Great, so that's--

00:27:10.577 --> 00:27:12.598
Almost done, sorry, lots of--

00:27:12.598 --> 00:27:14.184
TALIESIN: No, take your time.

00:27:14.184 --> 00:27:17.017
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're all figuring it out.

00:27:18.369 --> 00:27:19.737
SAM: 40 points of damage.

00:27:19.737 --> 00:27:21.912
MATT: Nice.
LIAM: Boy. Boy.

00:27:21.912 --> 00:27:23.262
MATT: Woo. All righty.

00:27:24.337 --> 00:27:26.746
Are you staying put or are you?

00:27:26.746 --> 00:27:28.429
SAM: Probably knows I'm there.

00:27:28.429 --> 00:27:30.420
I'll just bonus action shoot again.

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:31.420
MATT: Go for it.

00:27:33.214 --> 00:27:34.476
SAM: This one's a 18 to hit.

00:27:34.476 --> 00:27:35.451
MATT: 18 misses.

00:27:35.451 --> 00:27:36.284
SAM: Ooh.

00:27:36.284 --> 00:27:37.630
MATT: Or more so it hits its hide,

00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:40.092
and does not penetrate more than like half an inch,

00:27:40.092 --> 00:27:41.684
and then just sticks out before wobbling

00:27:41.684 --> 00:27:43.641
and falling to the ground. (crashing)

00:27:43.641 --> 00:27:44.769
No effect.

00:27:44.769 --> 00:27:48.892
SAM: And then I will-- I guess I have some movement.

00:27:48.892 --> 00:27:50.699
I'm between the two cages, right?

00:27:50.699 --> 00:27:52.265
MATT: You are, yes.
SAM: Can I just--

00:27:53.841 --> 00:27:55.213
Can I use half my movement

00:27:55.213 --> 00:27:57.351
to, like, climb up on the side of the cage?

00:27:57.351 --> 00:27:58.659
MATT: If you want to.
SAM: Yeah, sure.

00:27:58.659 --> 00:27:59.709
MATT: All right. That's easy.

00:27:59.709 --> 00:28:01.528
SAM: I don't know if I'll make it all the way up, but.

00:28:01.528 --> 00:28:04.108
MATT: It'll get you to the top and
that'll be your movement, I'll say.

00:28:04.108 --> 00:28:05.519
SAM: That's great.

00:28:05.519 --> 00:28:06.550
MATT: About a 12-foot cage.

00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:08.509
TRAVIS: You can give him nine hit points back

00:28:08.509 --> 00:28:10.530
I was looking at the wrong thing.

00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:13.348
MATT: Oh, good to know.
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:28:13.348 --> 00:28:14.681
MATT: Okay, perfect.

00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:17.399
All right, so does that finish your turn, Veth?

00:28:17.399 --> 00:28:18.337
SAM: Yes, it does.

00:28:18.337 --> 00:28:19.170
MATT: At the end of your turn,

00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:21.990
it's going to use one of its legendary actions.

00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:23.225
LAURA: Oh no.

00:28:23.225 --> 00:28:24.387
MATT: As it's stomping through,

00:28:24.387 --> 00:28:25.852
you're watching, it's taking the hits

00:28:25.852 --> 00:28:27.166
and still reeling from the impact.

00:28:27.166 --> 00:28:28.966
It looks around, it is horrifying,

00:28:28.966 --> 00:28:31.846
but also looks confused and a little like--

00:28:31.846 --> 00:28:35.046
LAURA: Oh, does it have a baby mind?

00:28:35.046 --> 00:28:37.454
MATT: It just looks confused and angrily

00:28:37.454 --> 00:28:40.115
spins back in this direction.

00:28:40.115 --> 00:28:41.806
LAURA: It looks scary as balls, y'all.

00:28:41.806 --> 00:28:45.179
MATT: And it's just going to use its grasping arms.

00:28:45.179 --> 00:28:46.827
SAM and MARISHA: Grasping arms?

00:28:46.827 --> 00:28:49.129
MATT: Yes. Because you are stunned,

00:28:49.129 --> 00:28:51.162
you automatically fail on the strength save.

00:28:51.162 --> 00:28:54.229
So Beauregard, as it spins around,

00:28:54.229 --> 00:28:55.365
the cluster of human arms

00:28:55.365 --> 00:28:58.099
that are constantly reaching
and grasping for whatever's nearby,

00:28:58.099 --> 00:28:59.750
three of them grab, pull you

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:02.299
and start holding you near the side of its mouth.

00:29:02.299 --> 00:29:06.619
And you are now currently grappled by the creature.

00:29:06.619 --> 00:29:08.418
TRAVIS: Okay, all right.

00:29:08.418 --> 00:29:09.410
ASHLEY: Okay, okay.

00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:11.524
TRAVIS: Maybe it just wants to cuddle.

00:29:11.524 --> 00:29:14.373
MATT: That brings us to the top of the round. Yasha.

00:29:14.373 --> 00:29:16.607
ASHLEY: Okay.
MATT: You are no longer stunned the top of your round.

00:29:16.607 --> 00:29:17.933
ASHLEY: Wait, do I roll a wisdom?

00:29:17.933 --> 00:29:20.725
You can do that, or you can try and avert your gaze

00:29:20.725 --> 00:29:23.124
now that you know the effect it can have on you.

00:29:25.857 --> 00:29:27.310
ASHLEY: I'm going to avert my gaze.

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:28.637
MATT: Okay, so you do not take--

00:29:28.637 --> 00:29:30.027
ASHLEY: I'm afraid roll wisdom.

00:29:30.027 --> 00:29:31.675
MATT: You don't take the wisdom save. You're good.

00:29:31.675 --> 00:29:33.275
However, you have to keep your eyes closed.

00:29:33.275 --> 00:29:37.862
So you're considered blinded for this entire round.

00:29:37.862 --> 00:29:39.437
ASHLEY: Fuck, okay.

00:29:40.662 --> 00:29:41.495
Okay.

00:29:42.499 --> 00:29:46.037
I don't know what the right thing to do is here.

00:29:46.037 --> 00:29:48.825
TALIESIN: Is blinded just disadvantage on attacks?

00:29:48.825 --> 00:29:52.884
MATT: Blinded is disadvantage on attacks and

00:29:52.884 --> 00:29:55.328
automatically fail any ability check that requires sight,

00:29:55.328 --> 00:29:58.003
and attack rolls against her have advantage.

00:29:59.647 --> 00:30:00.480
ASHLEY: Interesting.

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:01.494
LIAM: Oof, oof, oof.

00:30:01.494 --> 00:30:02.652
MATT: You are still prone, by the way.

00:30:02.652 --> 00:30:04.238
ASHLEY: --wisdom saving throw. Say again?

00:30:04.238 --> 00:30:06.174
MATT: You still are prone by the way.

00:30:06.174 --> 00:30:07.426
TRAVIS: So you've got to get up.
LIAM: Suggesting.

00:30:07.426 --> 00:30:11.976
ASHLEY: Okay, so I am going to, just from the ground.

00:30:13.395 --> 00:30:14.994
Oh fuck.
MATT: What are you doing?

00:30:14.994 --> 00:30:19.158
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'm going to try to stand up and--

00:30:19.158 --> 00:30:21.466
MATT: Half your movement to get back up on your feet.

00:30:21.466 --> 00:30:23.707
TRAVIS: What's your total movement speed?

00:30:23.707 --> 00:30:24.696
ASHLEY: 50.

00:30:24.696 --> 00:30:26.946
MATT: So 25 feet of movement still.

00:30:26.946 --> 00:30:29.096
MATT: Okay, so.

00:30:30.437 --> 00:30:32.262
Can I

00:30:33.479 --> 00:30:36.729
try to sort of pull Beau out of there?

00:30:38.261 --> 00:30:40.454
MATT: If you want to make an opposed
grapple check with the creature, yeah.

00:30:40.454 --> 00:30:41.999
ASHLEY: Oh.

00:30:41.999 --> 00:30:44.310
SAM: Blind Yasha versus the baby.
ASHLEY: That's at disadvantage?

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:46.344
MATT: Because you are blinded, yeah.
ASHLEY: Because I'm blinded.

00:30:46.344 --> 00:30:48.146
TALIESIN: Wouldn't rage un--?

00:30:48.146 --> 00:30:49.751
MATT: Rage gives you an advantage,
so it'd be just a straight roll.

00:30:49.751 --> 00:30:52.716
ASHLEY: Yeah, so I'm going to rage now that I'm standing.

00:30:52.716 --> 00:30:53.966
TRAVIS: Yes, you are.

00:30:55.232 --> 00:30:56.633
ASHLEY: Okay, and--

00:30:56.633 --> 00:30:58.924
MATT: No, it automatically fails
ability check that requires sight,

00:30:58.924 --> 00:31:00.470
but it doesn't require sight

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:03.605
if you know loosely where she is.

00:31:03.605 --> 00:31:05.246
If that's what you want to do, it's your call.

00:31:05.246 --> 00:31:06.550
ASHLEY: You know what I'm going to try to--

00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:08.468
I'm going to try to cut off this dangly bit.

00:31:08.468 --> 00:31:10.569
Yeah, I'm going to try to cut off the dangly bit.

00:31:10.569 --> 00:31:12.936
MARISHA: Fuck yes.
MATT: Okay, all right.

00:31:12.936 --> 00:31:13.769
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:17.673
MATT: So.
TRAVIS: Just like Starship Troopers.

00:31:18.639 --> 00:31:20.968
ASHLEY: That's a natural 18.

00:31:20.968 --> 00:31:22.933
MATT: Well, here's the thing.
You have disadvantage on attacks

00:31:22.933 --> 00:31:24.629
because you said you were--

00:31:24.629 --> 00:31:25.632
ASHLEY: Raging?

00:31:25.632 --> 00:31:26.465
TALIESIN: With raging.

00:31:26.465 --> 00:31:28.778
MATT: Rage doesn't give you advantage on attacks.

00:31:28.778 --> 00:31:30.557
Rage gives you bonus to damage.

00:31:30.557 --> 00:31:33.336
ASHLEY: So, but I have, okay, let me do it again.

00:31:33.336 --> 00:31:34.292
LAURA: Come on, big money.

00:31:34.292 --> 00:31:35.485
ASHLEY: So bad.

00:31:35.485 --> 00:31:36.568
That would be

00:31:38.086 --> 00:31:38.919
11.

00:31:38.919 --> 00:31:40.085
MATT: 11.
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:31:40.085 --> 00:31:42.505
MATT: You go to swing towards it and it just goes wide.

00:31:42.505 --> 00:31:44.185
As it's moving around now,

00:31:44.185 --> 00:31:46.673
it's looking like it's both confused

00:31:46.673 --> 00:31:49.545
and angry and hungry and it's just like a wild animal.

00:31:49.545 --> 00:31:50.465
You don't know what's going to happen.

00:31:50.465 --> 00:31:52.394
As you swing with your blade for your first strike,

00:31:52.394 --> 00:31:53.722
it just moves out of the way

00:31:53.722 --> 00:31:56.010
and it finds nothing.

00:31:56.010 --> 00:31:57.001
ASHLEY: I'm going to try again.

00:31:57.001 --> 00:31:57.834
MATT: Go for it.

00:31:57.834 --> 00:32:00.353
ASHLEY: Okay.
LIAM: You smell that pain in the air?

00:32:00.353 --> 00:32:01.923
ASHLEY: That would be

00:32:01.923 --> 00:32:03.283
a 22.

00:32:03.283 --> 00:32:04.465
ASHLEY: With disadvantage, don't forget.

00:32:04.465 --> 00:32:06.134
ASHLEY: With disadvantage, damn it.

00:32:06.134 --> 00:32:07.294
That's a natural one.

00:32:07.294 --> 00:32:09.198
(groaning)

00:32:09.198 --> 00:32:10.298
SAM: That do wild magic?

00:32:10.298 --> 00:32:12.898
LIAM: No, it's not.
MATT: It's just a physical attack.

00:32:13.861 --> 00:32:17.711
While you are not stunned by the lure at front of its head,

00:32:17.711 --> 00:32:19.998
in keeping your eyes closed to be pulled in.

00:32:19.998 --> 00:32:22.048
You're just swinging wild in the air

00:32:22.048 --> 00:32:23.213
and not able to find purchase

00:32:23.213 --> 00:32:25.767
with your weapon, unfortunately.

00:32:25.767 --> 00:32:29.173
ASHLEY: It's like being back at a birthday party
trying to hit the dumb piñata.

00:32:29.173 --> 00:32:30.061
MATT: I know.

00:32:30.061 --> 00:32:30.894
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:32:30.894 --> 00:32:31.810
MATT: That finish your turn or you want to move?

00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:34.627
You still have 25 feet of movement, if you want.

00:32:36.653 --> 00:32:37.494
MARISHA: Right.

00:32:37.494 --> 00:32:38.699
ASHLEY: I'm just trying to figure out if I should move or

00:32:38.699 --> 00:32:40.488
if I should stay.

00:32:40.488 --> 00:32:41.689
LAURA: That's amazing.

00:32:41.689 --> 00:32:44.132
TALIESIN: Remind me, does stun drop concentration?

00:32:44.132 --> 00:32:45.764
MATT: It does.
TALIESIN: Okay. Good.

00:32:45.764 --> 00:32:47.712
MATT: I had to learn that from research

00:32:47.712 --> 00:32:48.794
and the internet yelling at me going,

00:32:48.794 --> 00:32:52.211
"It does that!" I'm like, "You're right."

00:32:53.201 --> 00:32:54.034
ASHLEY: I will

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:57.756
stay?

00:32:57.756 --> 00:33:00.526
MATT: Okay. That finishes your turn.

00:33:00.526 --> 00:33:01.416
Okay.

00:33:01.416 --> 00:33:02.331
At the end of your turn, it's going to

00:33:02.331 --> 00:33:04.408
use its other two legendary actions

00:33:04.408 --> 00:33:08.006
to attempt a swallow strike on the grappled Beauregard.

00:33:08.006 --> 00:33:10.736
TRAVIS: (yelling) Oh no, you're getting swallowed?!

00:33:10.736 --> 00:33:13.136
Don't do it! Woo!

00:33:15.361 --> 00:33:17.103
LIAM: That baby's going to eat all the glizzies.

00:33:17.103 --> 00:33:19.353
(laughter)

00:33:20.686 --> 00:33:23.376
MATT: That is a 21 to hit.

00:33:23.376 --> 00:33:24.984
MARISHA: 21's my AC.
MATT: Oh shit.

00:33:24.984 --> 00:33:26.652
Yeah, that'll do it. All right.

00:33:26.652 --> 00:33:30.643
So first the hands fold you over.

00:33:30.643 --> 00:33:32.682
You're being rolled over as they grab and pull you

00:33:32.682 --> 00:33:35.220
into its mouth, the jaws close in.

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:38.021
As you begin to regain your senses, all you see are

00:33:38.021 --> 00:33:40.037
these two fleshy walls of teeth close

00:33:40.037 --> 00:33:43.534
around you like a horrible, organic iron maiden.

00:33:43.534 --> 00:33:46.054
And as it does, you take--

00:33:46.054 --> 00:33:48.304
LIAM: They've fire brigaded her.

00:33:51.123 --> 00:33:54.060
TRAVIS: Real bad in there, you guys.

00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:55.909
MATT: 22 points of piercing damage.

00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:57.992
TALIESIN: And?
MATT: Plus

00:34:00.394 --> 00:34:01.933
19 points of acid damage.

00:34:01.933 --> 00:34:03.667
LIAM: Oh my god.

00:34:03.667 --> 00:34:06.332
LAURA: Is Beau going to die?
Is Beau going to die? Is Beau going to die?!

00:34:06.332 --> 00:34:08.891
MATT: And you are swallowed.

00:34:08.891 --> 00:34:09.724
TALIESIN: Fuck.

00:34:12.991 --> 00:34:16.024
MATT: You guys watch as the mouth closes around,

00:34:16.024 --> 00:34:18.415
the neck pulses with muscular tension,

00:34:18.415 --> 00:34:19.898
and as the mouth opens once more,

00:34:19.898 --> 00:34:22.714
Beauregard is no longer within its jaws.

00:34:24.004 --> 00:34:25.737
So that brings us to--

00:34:25.737 --> 00:34:27.820
SAM: No more-egard.

00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:29.985
MATT: -- Beau's turn.
MARISHA: No mo'-regard?

00:34:29.985 --> 00:34:33.568
Oh no. (sad laughter)
MATT: Well, Beau--

00:34:33.568 --> 00:34:35.600
Beau, here's the good news.

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:36.507
You can't see the lure.

00:34:36.507 --> 00:34:37.906
So you're not stunned by it.

00:34:37.906 --> 00:34:41.611
MARISHA: Great news. Silver lining right here. Yeah.

00:34:41.611 --> 00:34:42.444
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

00:34:42.444 --> 00:34:44.176
MATT: The bad news is--

00:34:44.176 --> 00:34:47.342
MARISHA: Now I'm just sane as I'm being swallowed.

00:34:47.342 --> 00:34:48.985
TALIESIN: Oh god, how bad is it going to be?

00:34:48.985 --> 00:34:50.327
MATT: Actually, it rolled pretty badly.

00:34:50.327 --> 00:34:51.677
TALIESIN: Oh, thank god.

00:34:51.677 --> 00:34:53.732
SAM: Babies poop, like, five times a day.

00:34:53.732 --> 00:34:56.063
MARISHA: Yeah, you're right. High metabolism.

00:34:56.063 --> 00:34:57.394
SAM and MARISHA: Yeah.

00:34:57.394 --> 00:34:58.967
ASHLEY: Yeah. Ace Ventura your way out.

00:34:58.967 --> 00:35:01.442
MATT: You take 15 points of acid damage from the--

00:35:01.442 --> 00:35:04.101
MARISHA: Wait, what? Again, why?
MATT: -- from being within its stomach,

00:35:04.101 --> 00:35:05.890
as you are now being digested.

00:35:05.890 --> 00:35:07.648
But it's your turn. You can do what you want freely.

00:35:07.648 --> 00:35:08.574
SAM: Does that kill you?

00:35:08.574 --> 00:35:10.273
TRAVIS and LAURA: No.
MARISHA: 16 points?

00:35:10.273 --> 00:35:12.278
TRAVIS: It's getting real gnarly, though?
TALIESIN: 15 or 16?

00:35:12.278 --> 00:35:13.994
MATT: 15, I believe.
TALIESIN: 15.

00:35:13.994 --> 00:35:14.827
MARISHA: 15?

00:35:14.827 --> 00:35:15.670
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:17.599
MARISHA: I have 11 hit points left.
MATT: Oh shit.

00:35:17.599 --> 00:35:18.432
Okay.

00:35:19.649 --> 00:35:22.442
LAURA: So if she doesn't get out by her next turn,

00:35:22.442 --> 00:35:24.063
she's dead on her next one.

00:35:24.063 --> 00:35:25.675
SAM: She's got--
MATT: She's unconscious.

00:35:25.675 --> 00:35:26.992
She's got, she's got a plan.

00:35:26.992 --> 00:35:28.662
This is Beauregard we're--

00:35:28.662 --> 00:35:31.295
TRAVIS: Don't you duck face, Matthew!
You're married to that!

00:35:31.295 --> 00:35:32.890
SAM: She can do monk shit! Crazy monk shit.

00:35:32.890 --> 00:35:33.966
Just do some crazy monk shit.

00:35:33.966 --> 00:35:35.326
LIAM: Reach your hand out of that thing's mouth.

00:35:35.326 --> 00:35:36.159
Get your hand out.
MARISHA: Can I hit?

00:35:36.159 --> 00:35:37.692
What can I do? Can I hit him? Am I--

00:35:37.692 --> 00:35:38.895
MATT: You can punch from the inside.

00:35:38.895 --> 00:35:39.792
You can do all kinds of things.

00:35:39.792 --> 00:35:42.712
You can still try and fight your way out.

00:35:42.712 --> 00:35:44.471
If you do enough damage to it in one round,

00:35:44.471 --> 00:35:46.196
it may regurgitate you.

00:35:48.173 --> 00:35:49.734
MARISHA: Okay.

00:35:49.734 --> 00:35:50.828
MATT: But you are restrained

00:35:50.828 --> 00:35:51.986
so your attacks do have disadvantage

00:35:51.986 --> 00:35:53.765
because you're currently within its body.

00:35:53.765 --> 00:35:55.598
TRAVIS: Oh boy.
LAURA: What about--

00:35:57.882 --> 00:35:58.715
MARISHA: Okay.

00:35:58.715 --> 00:36:01.099
TRAVIS: Maybe it'll puke you up, man.

00:36:01.099 --> 00:36:02.381
Remember the kraken?

00:36:02.381 --> 00:36:03.424
Hey! Remember the kraken?

00:36:03.424 --> 00:36:04.748
That's how we got it to--

00:36:04.748 --> 00:36:06.617
It started puking us up every time I'd be like--

00:36:06.617 --> 00:36:07.750
MARISHA: Yeah, with damage.

00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:10.083
TRAVIS: I was doing the Drax shit.

00:36:11.161 --> 00:36:13.482
MARISHA: I probably couldn't light a spark in here, right?

00:36:13.482 --> 00:36:15.898
Probably a little too damp to light something.

00:36:15.898 --> 00:36:18.839
SAM: Firework action?
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:36:18.839 --> 00:36:19.972
LAURA: What about your gauntlets?

00:36:19.972 --> 00:36:23.639
Would your electric gauntlets light a spark?

00:36:25.116 --> 00:36:26.178
MARISHA: That's a good point.

00:36:26.178 --> 00:36:27.706
If I use my electric gauntlets

00:36:27.706 --> 00:36:31.212
and I'm inside of it, would I take electric damage?

00:36:31.212 --> 00:36:33.403
MATT: Probably not, but who knows?

00:36:33.403 --> 00:36:34.403
You can try.

00:36:35.813 --> 00:36:39.627
SAM: Acid's pretty conducive.

00:36:39.627 --> 00:36:43.047
MARISHA: I got 10 hit points left, I don't want to try.

00:36:43.047 --> 00:36:44.238
Okay.

00:36:44.238 --> 00:36:45.188
Okay.

00:36:45.188 --> 00:36:47.624
TRAVIS: (laughs)

00:36:47.624 --> 00:36:48.457
MARISHA: Okay.

00:36:48.457 --> 00:36:49.794
ASHLEY: Ugh, I have ungrappled you.

00:36:49.794 --> 00:36:50.627
LIAM: Oh shit.

00:36:52.321 --> 00:36:53.412
Shit.

00:36:53.412 --> 00:36:54.477
MARISHA: Okay.

00:36:54.477 --> 00:36:55.920
Okay.

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:56.771
Okay.

00:36:56.771 --> 00:36:58.287
TRAVIS: Yeah?
MATT: Okay.

00:36:58.287 --> 00:37:00.813
MARISHA: Oh, I don't know, I have no idea if that will work.

00:37:00.813 --> 00:37:01.687
MATT: Caduceus, you're on deck.

00:37:01.687 --> 00:37:02.724
TRAVIS: Nobody does.
TALIESIN: Fuck off.

00:37:02.724 --> 00:37:03.690
TRAVIS: Nobody does.

00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:04.921
LAURA: You can do it, Beau.

00:37:04.921 --> 00:37:06.198
You can do it.

00:37:06.198 --> 00:37:08.120
MARISHA: Who knows if this would even work.

00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:09.252
TALIESIN: I'm not built for this right now.

00:37:09.252 --> 00:37:10.085
Okay.

00:37:12.244 --> 00:37:14.577
Should've a breakfast. We're going to get our asses...

00:37:14.577 --> 00:37:16.527
MARISHA: Oh my god. This is dumb.

00:37:16.527 --> 00:37:19.839
I'm going to be really mad if this doesn't work.

00:37:19.839 --> 00:37:21.607
Can I reach for my equipment?

00:37:21.607 --> 00:37:23.527
Can I pull something out?

00:37:23.527 --> 00:37:25.051
MATT: What are you trying to pull out?

00:37:25.051 --> 00:37:26.151
MARISHA: Pouch?

00:37:28.568 --> 00:37:29.401
MATT: Just a pouch?

00:37:29.401 --> 00:37:31.195
MARISHA: Uh-huh.
MATT: Sure. Okay.

00:37:31.195 --> 00:37:33.519
MARISHA: It's my pouch of suude.

00:37:33.519 --> 00:37:34.429
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: And I think

00:37:34.429 --> 00:37:36.346
I have, like, 10 doses.

00:37:37.858 --> 00:37:40.525
MATT: Are you going to take drugs for your final moments?

00:37:40.525 --> 00:37:42.228
MARISHA: No. Can I dump it out in his stomach?

00:37:42.228 --> 00:37:43.700
LAURA: (gasps)

00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:46.647
MARISHA: Because you have to, like, after a certain amount

00:37:46.647 --> 00:37:50.047
of dosage, it gets really hard to save from that, right?

00:37:50.047 --> 00:37:51.464
MATT: Yeah.
MARISHA: To like--

00:37:52.365 --> 00:37:53.900
Is that a good idea?

00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:58.900
MATT: Give it a shot. Try it out.
TRAVIS: Its metabolism has to be super fast.

00:37:59.161 --> 00:38:00.638
LAURA: You're giving drugs to a baby.

00:38:00.638 --> 00:38:02.554
TRAVIS: Doesn't it take like 30 minutes to kick in?
MATT: No, this is.

00:38:02.554 --> 00:38:04.626
MARISHA: I don't know. It's magic drugs.

00:38:04.626 --> 00:38:06.294
It's really powerful magic drugs.

00:38:06.294 --> 00:38:07.910
LIAM: It's fucking awesome. It's great.

00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:09.879
ASHLEY: I love it.
MARISHA: I have

00:38:09.879 --> 00:38:11.478
10 doses.
LAURA: Use it all.

00:38:11.478 --> 00:38:14.119
MARISHA: And I'm going to dump
the whole package into his stomach.

00:38:14.119 --> 00:38:15.626
MATT: All right. That'll be your action this turn.

00:38:15.626 --> 00:38:16.666
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

00:38:16.666 --> 00:38:17.785
LIAM: Super fucking creative.

00:38:17.785 --> 00:38:20.595
MARISHA: That might be a terrible idea.

00:38:20.595 --> 00:38:21.428
MATT: Okay.

00:38:21.428 --> 00:38:23.944
SAM: What's the effect?

00:38:23.944 --> 00:38:26.326
MARISHA: It's like if you have one dose,

00:38:26.326 --> 00:38:28.675
it adds to your sorcerer point damage.

00:38:28.675 --> 00:38:30.795
But I think with each additional hit

00:38:30.795 --> 00:38:32.520
you have to

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:34.327
roll on a table.

00:38:34.327 --> 00:38:36.966
MATT: Do you have noted what color it was?

00:38:36.966 --> 00:38:39.225
LAURA: What color the suude was?

00:38:39.225 --> 00:38:41.321
MARISHA: What color? I just have "suude" written down.

00:38:41.321 --> 00:38:44.035
It was that giant pouch of suude that I

00:38:44.035 --> 00:38:47.295
made sure Veth got back for me from Vokodo.

00:38:47.295 --> 00:38:48.789
I've had it since like the beginning of the game.

00:38:48.789 --> 00:38:51.754
SAM: It's not like PCP that's
going to make this thing, a killing machine, right?

00:38:51.754 --> 00:38:54.587
MARISHA: I think I stole this
from The Gentlemen or something.

00:38:54.587 --> 00:38:55.945
(laughter)

00:38:55.945 --> 00:38:57.170
LAURA: You might've made it stronger.

00:38:57.170 --> 00:38:58.095
LIAM: She's about to die.

00:38:58.095 --> 00:39:00.086
Of course she would try anything.
MATT: I don't have the specific

00:39:00.086 --> 00:39:01.361
details or anything or what color it was.

00:39:01.361 --> 00:39:02.758
There are three different colors of suude.

00:39:02.758 --> 00:39:04.558
So we'll just say brown suude.

00:39:04.558 --> 00:39:05.649
SAM: Sure.
MARISHA: Do you remember?

00:39:05.649 --> 00:39:07.099
What are the colors?

00:39:07.099 --> 00:39:11.091
MATT: The colors were brown, red and blue, I believe.

00:39:11.091 --> 00:39:12.327
TALIESIN: Oh boy.

00:39:12.327 --> 00:39:13.777
MATT: So.

00:39:13.777 --> 00:39:15.291
MARISHA: I feel like it was, I don't know.

00:39:15.291 --> 00:39:16.785
Maybe, look, maybe you have it.

00:39:16.785 --> 00:39:18.545
MATT: Let me look at the rules for suude real fast.

00:39:18.545 --> 00:39:19.386
Give me just a second.

00:39:19.386 --> 00:39:21.238
SAM: There's suude rules?

00:39:21.238 --> 00:39:22.577
Did you make these suude rules?

00:39:22.577 --> 00:39:23.410
MATT: I did.

00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:24.582
SAM: Wow.

00:39:24.582 --> 00:39:25.820
MARISHA: It was a bunch...

00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:28.552
SAM: Suude Rules, by the way,
is the worst Road Rules spinoff.

00:39:28.552 --> 00:39:31.057
(laughter)

00:39:31.057 --> 00:39:32.115
LAURA: Jeez louise.

00:39:32.115 --> 00:39:33.473
TRAVIS: Road Rules.

00:39:33.473 --> 00:39:34.759
SAM: Road Rules.
TRAVIS: Oh man.

00:39:34.759 --> 00:39:37.105
SAM: I don't think I ever actually watched that show.

00:39:37.105 --> 00:39:38.067
LAURA: Is Road Rules when--

00:39:38.067 --> 00:39:39.827
SAM: It was a spinoff of Real World.

00:39:39.827 --> 00:39:41.318
LAURA: Road Rules was the-- okay.

00:39:41.318 --> 00:39:44.700
The Real World was the very first reality show. Right?

00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:47.103
TRAVIS: Real World vs. Road Rules.

00:39:47.103 --> 00:39:48.172
MARISHA: Somebody. I stole this

00:39:48.172 --> 00:39:52.804
from someone's stash and it was really good, expensive shit.

00:39:52.804 --> 00:39:53.877
So I don't know what that means.

00:39:53.877 --> 00:39:56.060
MATT: So yeah. So it has to be a constitution saving throw

00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:58.076
to maintain consciousness.

00:39:58.076 --> 00:40:00.226
And for each dose they take

00:40:00.226 --> 00:40:02.244
within an hour of the original dose,

00:40:02.244 --> 00:40:05.744
the DC goes up by three and it's 10 doses.

00:40:06.817 --> 00:40:08.309
So

00:40:08.309 --> 00:40:09.392
that is a DC,

00:40:12.410 --> 00:40:14.135
a 37 DC,

00:40:14.135 --> 00:40:16.568
LIAM: That's an auto-kill.

00:40:16.568 --> 00:40:17.925
MATT: Just going to roll for fun.

00:40:17.925 --> 00:40:19.075
SAM: Does it--

00:40:19.075 --> 00:40:20.833
MATT: It fails with a natural one, hilariously.

00:40:20.833 --> 00:40:22.818
(laughter)

00:40:22.818 --> 00:40:25.723
MARISHA: Babies have a low tolerance to drugs.

00:40:25.723 --> 00:40:27.289
SAM: I learned that the hard way.

00:40:27.289 --> 00:40:28.836
(laughter)

00:40:28.836 --> 00:40:30.822
MATT: ♪ The more you know. ♪

00:40:30.822 --> 00:40:33.228
TRAVIS: Babies have a low tolerance to drugs.

00:40:33.228 --> 00:40:36.414
TALIESIN: It's just whiskey in a bottle.
MATT: Oh no, no.

00:40:36.414 --> 00:40:37.583
SAM: Come on, hold your shit.

00:40:37.583 --> 00:40:39.098
(laughter)

00:40:39.098 --> 00:40:40.190
MARISHA: This is conditioning.

00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:41.951
(snapping fingers)

00:40:41.951 --> 00:40:44.023
LAURA: So what does it do?

00:40:44.023 --> 00:40:46.698
LIAM: I feel like I better say:
Please don't give your baby drugs.

00:40:46.698 --> 00:40:50.099
LAURA: Yeah, don't give your baby drugs.
SAM: Do we need to do that PSA right now?

00:40:50.099 --> 00:40:52.876
TALIESIN: We're saying no, right now.
SAM: Please don't give your baby drugs.

00:40:52.876 --> 00:40:54.372
TALIESIN: Yeah.
SAM: That's fair.

00:40:54.372 --> 00:40:58.294
MATT: Now the rules for suude
are based on a human physiology.

00:40:58.294 --> 00:40:59.643
SAM: Oh, okay, okay.

00:40:59.643 --> 00:41:00.981
MARISHA: Sure, sure.
MATT: So.

00:41:00.981 --> 00:41:02.828
This is definitely not a human.

00:41:02.828 --> 00:41:04.128
LIAM: That's fair. That's fair.
MATT: And this

00:41:04.128 --> 00:41:05.920
definitely would not suffer the extreme

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:10.725
consequences that a suude overdose would necessarily.

00:41:10.725 --> 00:41:11.660
So.

00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:12.920
MARISHA: It rolled a one.

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:13.838
MATT: I did roll one.

00:41:13.838 --> 00:41:16.966
So it is going unconscious for 2d4 rounds.

00:41:16.966 --> 00:41:19.114
MARISHA: For 2d4.
SAM: 2d4 rounds.

00:41:19.114 --> 00:41:20.189
LAURA: Oh wow!

00:41:20.189 --> 00:41:21.646
MARISHA: Is he going to barf me up?

00:41:21.646 --> 00:41:23.983
MATT: No, but somebody has to pull you out

00:41:23.983 --> 00:41:27.722
Which can happen when it's unconscious

00:41:27.722 --> 00:41:29.472
or unable to respond.

00:41:30.378 --> 00:41:31.702
So.

00:41:31.702 --> 00:41:33.089
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:41:33.089 --> 00:41:34.741
MATT: (growling)

00:41:34.741 --> 00:41:37.213
LIAM: I was wrong. There is a cheat code.

00:41:37.213 --> 00:41:41.008
MATT: Falls onto its side, unconscious.

00:41:41.008 --> 00:41:42.705
(laughter)

00:41:42.705 --> 00:41:43.538
MARISHA: Help!

00:41:43.538 --> 00:41:47.507
LAURA: Do you have to roll for how long it stays?

00:41:47.507 --> 00:41:49.740
SAM: Beau must taste like shit.

00:41:50.781 --> 00:41:52.033
LAURA: What did she do?

00:41:52.033 --> 00:41:53.356
MARISHA: I'm a hard pill to swallow.

00:41:53.356 --> 00:41:54.447
MATT: Three rounds.

00:41:54.447 --> 00:41:56.288
LAURA and MARISHA: Three rounds?

00:41:56.288 --> 00:41:57.463
MATT: Two and a one, but.

00:41:57.463 --> 00:41:58.938
MARISHA: A two and a one? Okay.
LAURA: That's still huge.

00:41:58.938 --> 00:41:59.771
MARISHA: Okay. Okay. Okay.

00:41:59.771 --> 00:42:01.479
ASHLEY: Even if we attack him?

00:42:01.479 --> 00:42:02.549
SAM: 18 seconds to pull her

00:42:02.549 --> 00:42:04.454
out of there.
MATT: You'll find out.

00:42:04.454 --> 00:42:06.527
TALIESIN: I'm going to-- you've got a dupe there

00:42:06.527 --> 00:42:07.877
and you're strong.

00:42:07.877 --> 00:42:12.408
I'm going to hold my turn to heal Beau.

00:42:12.408 --> 00:42:15.067
When I can see Beau.

00:42:15.067 --> 00:42:17.591
SAM: I'm going to jump down and rush over to help.
LAURA: But you can't do anything physical.

00:42:17.591 --> 00:42:19.527
She can only cast spells.

00:42:19.527 --> 00:42:20.360
SAM: Then I'm going to go in and

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:22.745
I'm going to dive in the mouth.

00:42:22.745 --> 00:42:23.578
MATT: Okay.

00:42:23.578 --> 00:42:26.406
LAURA: Can we tell-- will we know, like--
LIAM: But we're out of sequence.

00:42:26.406 --> 00:42:28.338
LAURA: Can we tell the baby is unconscious?
MATT: We're still doing sequence here.

00:42:28.338 --> 00:42:30.421
TALIESIN: In that case--

00:42:30.421 --> 00:42:31.712
LAURA: Okay. So Beau could--

00:42:31.712 --> 00:42:33.221
TALIESIN: I'm going to hold my heal.

00:42:33.221 --> 00:42:34.738
SAM: Hold my heal.
MARISHA: Okay.

00:42:34.738 --> 00:42:37.240
TALIESIN: Because, worst case scenario,
even if you're unconscious--

00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:38.714
MARISHA: Okay.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:42:38.714 --> 00:42:41.809
TRAVIS: I mean, it's unconscious. They're autocrits, right?

00:42:41.809 --> 00:42:43.126
LAURA: She's not unconscious.

00:42:43.126 --> 00:42:44.634
TRAVIS: No, no. The thing's unconscious.

00:42:44.634 --> 00:42:47.602
LAURA: Yeah, we get autocrits against baby.

00:42:47.602 --> 00:42:49.843
Within five feet, a melee attack is an autocrit

00:42:49.843 --> 00:42:52.259
against an unconscious creature.

00:42:52.259 --> 00:42:53.591
TALIESIN: Well, we'll be--

00:42:53.591 --> 00:42:55.273
Beau, and then.
SAM: Get over there.

00:42:55.273 --> 00:42:56.581
LAURA: Okay, yeah.

00:42:56.581 --> 00:42:58.599
MATT: Caduceus, you're holding a-- what spell?

00:42:58.599 --> 00:42:59.932
TALIESIN: I'm holding a--

00:43:01.392 --> 00:43:03.596
Eh, where'd it go?

00:43:03.596 --> 00:43:05.649
Sorry. I'm losing my mind.

00:43:05.649 --> 00:43:06.791
Where'd it go?

00:43:08.659 --> 00:43:11.777
I'm losing-- I'm holding a Heal spell.

00:43:11.777 --> 00:43:13.996
MATT: Oh, Heal? Okay, got it.

00:43:13.996 --> 00:43:15.145
LIAM: Me.
MATT: Caleb, you're up next.

00:43:15.145 --> 00:43:18.720
LIAM: I pull out the lodestone and grip it in my arm

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:20.493
with a finger full of dust.

00:43:20.493 --> 00:43:22.748
I just let the drift globe float.

00:43:22.748 --> 00:43:25.639
And I'm holding my turn for when I see Beauregard

00:43:25.639 --> 00:43:27.505
out of the baby,

00:43:27.505 --> 00:43:30.532
and I will cast Disintegrate
once Beauregard is out of the baby.

00:43:30.532 --> 00:43:32.623
MATT: You've got it. Okay.

00:43:32.623 --> 00:43:35.206
Just double-checking here for--

00:43:36.359 --> 00:43:37.192
I'm pretty sure.

00:43:37.192 --> 00:43:38.496
And I think I've forgotten in the past, too.

00:43:38.496 --> 00:43:39.983
Holding a spell while you're holding it.

00:43:39.983 --> 00:43:42.007
It does become a concentration spell,
even if it's instantaneous.

00:43:42.007 --> 00:43:44.656
TALIESIN: Oh, I'll drop that shit.
MATT: So it'll drop your thing. Just so you know.

00:43:44.656 --> 00:43:46.294
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

00:43:46.294 --> 00:43:49.323
And you are also back no longer invisible.

00:43:49.323 --> 00:43:51.342
TALIESIN: Nope.
MATT: There you go.

00:43:51.342 --> 00:43:53.597
LAURA: Oh, that's what that was.

00:43:53.597 --> 00:43:55.400
I was like, "There's a crystal in the--"

00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:56.371
TALIESIN: Thank you.

00:43:56.371 --> 00:43:58.015
MATT: All right. So that finished the Caduceus' turn.

00:43:58.015 --> 00:43:58.848
Caleb's turn.

00:43:58.848 --> 00:44:00.664
You're both holding spells.

00:44:00.664 --> 00:44:01.818
Jester, you're up.

00:44:01.818 --> 00:44:03.242
LAURA: I have a question.
MATT: Yeah.

00:44:03.242 --> 00:44:07.867
LAURA: Is his eye dangles still bright,

00:44:07.867 --> 00:44:08.929
or did it dim?

00:44:08.929 --> 00:44:11.515
MATT: No, it's still bright.

00:44:11.515 --> 00:44:12.486
TRAVIS: It's still bright.

00:44:12.486 --> 00:44:13.830
MATT: Yeah. Nothing happened to that.

00:44:13.830 --> 00:44:17.155
SAM: Does that mean we have to roll for wisdom to save?

00:44:17.155 --> 00:44:19.652
MATT: Whoever's closest to it, maybe. Depending.

00:44:19.652 --> 00:44:21.104
SAM: Okay. Okay.

00:44:21.104 --> 00:44:23.579
MATT: Which, actually, to that point,

00:44:25.383 --> 00:44:29.725
before-- because I need to keep track of that
since the light is still up.

00:44:29.725 --> 00:44:33.019
Could I have both Caduceus and Caleb
roll wisdom saving rolls?

00:44:33.019 --> 00:44:35.595
TRAVIS: What's the radius on the light?

00:44:35.595 --> 00:44:37.012
MATT: You don't know.

00:44:38.326 --> 00:44:39.159
TALIESIN: 14.

00:44:40.232 --> 00:44:41.917
MATT: 14 is exactly what you needed.

00:44:41.917 --> 00:44:43.023
LIAM: 25.
MATT: 25.

00:44:43.023 --> 00:44:45.769
So you guys continue your turns. You're fine.

00:44:45.769 --> 00:44:47.162
TALIESIN: Please, someone pull her out of there.

00:44:47.162 --> 00:44:48.428
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: All right.

00:44:48.428 --> 00:44:49.261
So Jester.

00:44:49.261 --> 00:44:52.561
LAURA: I don't know if I can get all the way up to the baby.

00:44:52.561 --> 00:44:54.003
LIAM: We're a ways away from that thing.

00:44:54.003 --> 00:44:54.963
ASHLEY: I'm right there, so I can--

00:44:54.963 --> 00:44:57.192
LAURA: I'm going to take my coat off and run

00:44:57.192 --> 00:45:01.120
towards the baby and hold it up in front of my eye.

00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:03.061
Like, hold it up in front of my face

00:45:03.061 --> 00:45:04.344
to try to block the light

00:45:04.344 --> 00:45:06.443
of the thingy as I'm running towards it.

00:45:06.443 --> 00:45:07.276
MATT: Okay.

00:45:10.279 --> 00:45:12.155
Put you about there, I'll say.

00:45:12.155 --> 00:45:13.013
TALIESIN: Double run?

00:45:13.013 --> 00:45:14.305
LAURA: Yeah. I'm going to double dash if I can.

00:45:14.305 --> 00:45:16.051
MATT: Double dash. Okay.

00:45:16.051 --> 00:45:17.953
So you're going right up next to it?

00:45:17.953 --> 00:45:18.961
LAURA: Yeah.

00:45:18.961 --> 00:45:21.484
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: ♪ Double, double your refreshment. ♪

00:45:21.484 --> 00:45:22.317
TRAVIS: Shit.

00:45:22.317 --> 00:45:23.150
SAM: What are you holding there?

00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:24.157
LAURA: My coat.

00:45:24.157 --> 00:45:26.736
TALIESIN: If you can get all the way, are you going to--?

00:45:26.736 --> 00:45:28.199
LAURA: I don't think I can get all the way.

00:45:28.199 --> 00:45:29.032
MATT: You cannot get all the way.

00:45:29.032 --> 00:45:31.588
LAURA: Okay. Yeah. My goal is to cover up the

00:45:31.588 --> 00:45:34.207
the eyeball thing with my coat as he lays there.

00:45:34.207 --> 00:45:35.968
MATT: Okay.

00:45:35.968 --> 00:45:39.677
That finishes Jester's go. It's now its turn.

00:45:39.677 --> 00:45:41.637
It can't do anything, as it is unconscious.

00:45:41.637 --> 00:45:44.009
However, it does get a save to try

00:45:44.009 --> 00:45:45.481
and see if it can get back up.

00:45:45.481 --> 00:45:47.423
LAURA: (gasps)

00:45:47.423 --> 00:45:48.256
MATT: It does not.

00:45:48.256 --> 00:45:49.288
SAM: Oh.

00:45:49.288 --> 00:45:54.240
MATT: All right. That brings us to Fjord.
Veth, you're on deck.

00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:56.952
TALIESIN: If you can get there real quick, that'd be great.

00:45:56.952 --> 00:45:59.046
TRAVIS: Yeah. I mean, I can, but if I get there

00:45:59.046 --> 00:46:01.277
and I fail a wisdom save, I'm just a mannequin.

00:46:01.277 --> 00:46:02.110
TALIESIN: That's fair.

00:46:02.110 --> 00:46:04.353
TRAVIS: Because of the position he's laying in,

00:46:04.353 --> 00:46:07.254
is the light lying in front of his face?

00:46:07.254 --> 00:46:11.281
So his ass would obscure the light, or is it a--?

00:46:11.281 --> 00:46:12.745
MATT: One way to find out.
TRAVIS: Got to find out.

00:46:12.745 --> 00:46:14.108
Fuck it, there's nothing else to do.

00:46:14.108 --> 00:46:15.713
All right. I'm going to use my 30 feet

00:46:15.713 --> 00:46:19.963
of movement to come towards him as far as I can.

00:46:21.072 --> 00:46:22.094
MATT: 30 right there.

00:46:22.094 --> 00:46:25.874
TRAVIS: And I'm going to use my-- what the hell's it called?

00:46:25.874 --> 00:46:27.178
My

00:46:27.178 --> 00:46:31.143
Relentless Hex to teleport 30 feet

00:46:31.143 --> 00:46:32.715
right up on his

00:46:32.715 --> 00:46:33.960
anus.

00:46:35.310 --> 00:46:36.156
MATT: There you go.

00:46:36.156 --> 00:46:37.785
If you want to, you can go ahead and be there.

00:46:37.785 --> 00:46:40.442
TRAVIS: Yeah, whatever is puts him between me and the light.

00:46:40.442 --> 00:46:41.275
MATT: You got it.

00:46:41.275 --> 00:46:44.256
TRAVIS: Do I have to roll a wisdom save?

00:46:44.256 --> 00:46:45.788
MATT: You do not right now.

00:46:45.788 --> 00:46:48.287
TRAVIS: Okay.
MATT: Because it is prone, unconscious,

00:46:48.287 --> 00:46:50.335
and from a logistic standpoint, right now

00:46:50.335 --> 00:46:51.507
you cannot see the source of the light.

00:46:51.507 --> 00:46:53.686
TRAVIS: Should I just try and hit it?

00:46:53.686 --> 00:46:54.896
LAURA: Just hit it right now. Hit it.

00:46:54.896 --> 00:46:57.840
TRAVIS: Okay. Fuck it. I'm going to--

00:46:57.840 --> 00:46:59.789
I'm going to take--

00:46:59.789 --> 00:47:02.579
LAURA: Use your [Inaudible]!
TRAVIS: I know! I'm going to use--

00:47:02.579 --> 00:47:03.856
I'm going to take a swipe

00:47:03.856 --> 00:47:06.293
with the Star Razor.

00:47:06.293 --> 00:47:07.829
MATT: Yeah. Go for it.

00:47:07.829 --> 00:47:09.360
TRAVIS: Which is a natural.

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:11.441
It's an instant crit, right?

00:47:11.441 --> 00:47:13.409
MATT: As long as you--

00:47:13.409 --> 00:47:14.397
Let me see here.

00:47:14.397 --> 00:47:15.523
LAURA: As long as you hit it.

00:47:15.523 --> 00:47:16.924
MATT: You have advantage on the attack roll,

00:47:16.924 --> 00:47:19.889
and as long as you hit it, it's an automatic crit.

00:47:19.889 --> 00:47:23.368
TRAVIS: That's a natural 19, which is already a crit.

00:47:23.368 --> 00:47:24.808
MARISHA: But see if you can get a 20.

00:47:24.808 --> 00:47:25.641
LAURA: Oh, it doesn't matter.

00:47:25.641 --> 00:47:27.257
TRAVIS: I crit on 19 or 20.

00:47:27.257 --> 00:47:28.090
MATT: Yeah.

00:47:28.090 --> 00:47:30.403
TRAVIS: And the second one, let's just do the first one.

00:47:30.403 --> 00:47:31.803
TALIESIN: Yeah. Just take it,

00:47:31.803 --> 00:47:34.886
TRAVIS: I'm going to pump a
5th-level Divine Smite into that.

00:47:34.886 --> 00:47:36.474
MATT: Jesus Christ, go for it.

00:47:36.474 --> 00:47:38.887
LIAM: This is going to be massive.

00:47:38.887 --> 00:47:40.112
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:47:40.112 --> 00:47:41.010
(squealing)

00:47:41.010 --> 00:47:41.946
Okay.

00:47:41.946 --> 00:47:44.283
Okay. Where the fuck is that thing?

00:47:44.283 --> 00:47:45.174
Divine Smite.

00:47:45.174 --> 00:47:47.239
TRAVIS: He's missing his chance to pull you out of its anus

00:47:47.239 --> 00:47:48.527
like Ace Ventura, though.

00:47:48.527 --> 00:47:51.352
TRAVIS: Yeah, you assume I could even do that.

00:47:51.352 --> 00:47:54.040
MARISHA: But he could have ten miles--
LAURA: But I don't think you can reach the stomach

00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:56.324
from his butt.
TALIESIN: There might be three other people in there.

00:47:56.324 --> 00:47:58.171
MARISHA: There could be 3 other people in there?
TALIESIN: Just waiting.

00:47:58.171 --> 00:48:00.183
TRAVIS: It's a max of 5d8,

00:48:00.183 --> 00:48:02.287
not 6d8 because it's not undead or anything?

00:48:02.287 --> 00:48:04.062
MATT: Correct.
SAM: It looks scarier on its side.

00:48:04.062 --> 00:48:05.578
TRAVIS: 6d...

00:48:05.578 --> 00:48:07.105
TALIESIN: I can just see into the mouth.

00:48:07.105 --> 00:48:08.474
TRAVIS: I should do the ten first.

00:48:08.474 --> 00:48:10.964
Jesus, I'm from freaking the fuck out.

00:48:10.964 --> 00:48:12.355
MARISHA: My heart is pounding.

00:48:12.355 --> 00:48:14.246
TRAVIS: 18, okay.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:48:14.246 --> 00:48:16.551
TRAVIS: I just broke that.

00:48:16.551 --> 00:48:18.753
SAM: We're just baby crazy.

00:48:18.753 --> 00:48:20.713
(laughter)

00:48:20.713 --> 00:48:23.994
MARISHA: That's one way of putting it.

00:48:23.994 --> 00:48:24.951
LIAM: It's just like we planned it.

00:48:24.951 --> 00:48:26.809
Let it swallow Beau,

00:48:26.809 --> 00:48:28.560
who murders her from the inside.

00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:30.326
Everybody piles up.

00:48:30.326 --> 00:48:32.617
MARISHA: I was saving that suude to maybe assassinate

00:48:32.617 --> 00:48:35.364
a member of the Cerberus Assembly, but this works.

00:48:35.364 --> 00:48:36.274
LIAM: Right.
SAM: Sure.

00:48:36.274 --> 00:48:38.273
TRAVIS: So that's 40,

00:48:38.273 --> 00:48:41.011
40 points of damage, doubled.
SAM: You could OD on it.

00:48:41.011 --> 00:48:42.875
MATT: For the dice. Modifiers aren't doubled.

00:48:42.875 --> 00:48:44.359
MARISHA: He was making you roll for that shit--
TRAVIS: All right. So.

00:48:44.359 --> 00:48:47.806
MARISHA: -- for Scanlan.
TRAVIS: So it'll just be

00:48:47.806 --> 00:48:49.368
35 points, doubled.

00:48:49.368 --> 00:48:51.384
MATT: So 70 plus modifiers.

00:48:51.384 --> 00:48:53.559
TRAVIS: 75.
MATT: 75.

00:48:53.559 --> 00:48:55.625
TRAVIS: On the first hit.

00:48:55.625 --> 00:48:57.505
LAURA: On the first hit.

00:48:57.505 --> 00:48:59.884
MATT: Okay, that's a lot of damage.

00:48:59.884 --> 00:49:01.837
TRAVIS: Okay. I'll take the second swipe.

00:49:01.837 --> 00:49:02.837
MATT: Go for it.

00:49:04.469 --> 00:49:07.406
The shock of pain does awaken it from its unconsciousness.

00:49:07.406 --> 00:49:09.157
LIAM: There it is.

00:49:09.157 --> 00:49:10.640
TRAVIS: Okay. Okay. Okay.

00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:11.656
MATT: So it's still prone.

00:49:11.656 --> 00:49:13.080
So you still have advantage on attacks,

00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:15.102
but the second one is not a crit.

00:49:15.102 --> 00:49:17.962
SAM: It's like that--
TRAVIS: Oh, it's so close again.

00:49:17.962 --> 00:49:21.020
18. Plus, plus 10.

00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:22.356
Yeah.
MATT: That hits.

00:49:22.356 --> 00:49:23.189
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:49:23.189 --> 00:49:26.381
MARISHA: Really hoping it would do more than that.

00:49:26.381 --> 00:49:27.686
MATT: Yeah, the suude rules
are based on a humanoid creature.

00:49:27.686 --> 00:49:29.472
TRAVIS: Should I just dump it? Should I just dump it?

00:49:29.472 --> 00:49:32.154
LAURA: Yeah, at this point dump it.
TRAVIS: I'm going to dump the other

00:49:32.154 --> 00:49:34.581
5th-level Divine Smite into it.

00:49:34.581 --> 00:49:35.781
Okay.
MATT: Go for it.

00:49:35.781 --> 00:49:39.769
TALIESIN: It just might do enough
damage to get him to throw you up. Maybe?

00:49:39.769 --> 00:49:42.902
MATT: Well, the damage has to be
from the inside to get it to throw up.

00:49:44.929 --> 00:49:46.659
TALIESIN: Out of idle curiosity.

00:49:46.659 --> 00:49:49.128
I can't change targets if it's rolling close

00:49:49.128 --> 00:49:49.961
to the end of my run.

00:49:49.961 --> 00:49:51.115
LAURA: Hey, at least, you know what--

00:49:51.115 --> 00:49:53.227
TALIESIN: Can I switch if I'm about to burn?

00:49:53.227 --> 00:49:55.242
LAURA: At least it was just the baby's turn.

00:49:55.242 --> 00:49:56.850
So we get all of our--

00:49:56.850 --> 00:49:58.557
TALIESIN: As long as I'm casting and I just don't see

00:49:58.557 --> 00:50:01.084
if I could just like, if a spell's coming.

00:50:01.084 --> 00:50:02.240
MATT: I'd allow it.
TALIESIN: All right.

00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:03.117
Thank you.

00:50:03.117 --> 00:50:04.877
LAURA: But he does probably get legendary actions.

00:50:04.877 --> 00:50:06.317
SAM: Throw a bunch of healing potions

00:50:06.317 --> 00:50:09.087
into its mouth and hope that one lands on Beau.

00:50:09.087 --> 00:50:11.039
LAURA: Hits Beau? That's smart.

00:50:11.039 --> 00:50:14.111
TRAVIS: 43 points of damage.

00:50:14.111 --> 00:50:15.774
MATT: Damn!

00:50:15.774 --> 00:50:17.294
(laughter)

00:50:17.294 --> 00:50:19.679
All righty.
TRAVIS: 43, so.

00:50:19.679 --> 00:50:21.382
MATT: That finish your turn, Fjord?

00:50:22.111 --> 00:50:22.944
TRAVIS: Yes.

00:50:22.944 --> 00:50:24.502
MATT: All right.
LIAM: Pull her out.

00:50:24.502 --> 00:50:25.460
MATT: Veth, you're up.
TRAVIS: It was 113.

00:50:25.460 --> 00:50:28.781
SAM: I guess I'm going to try to pull her out.

00:50:28.781 --> 00:50:29.851
LAURA: Oh god, baby's awake.

00:50:29.851 --> 00:50:31.710
MATT: Actually no, because it--

00:50:31.710 --> 00:50:33.101
it did get its legendary actions back on its turn

00:50:33.101 --> 00:50:36.361
even though it was unconscious. At the end of Fjord's turn,

00:50:36.361 --> 00:50:38.436
since there's not much else it can really do at the moment.

00:50:38.436 --> 00:50:39.269
LIAM: Oh god.

00:50:39.269 --> 00:50:41.747
MATT: It's going to use one legendary action to--

00:50:41.747 --> 00:50:43.411
because it just can't use that because it's prone--

00:50:43.411 --> 00:50:46.411
to grasping arms strike against you, Yasha.

00:50:46.411 --> 00:50:47.869
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:50:47.869 --> 00:50:50.036
LIAM: Maybe you'll be together.
MARISHA: We all float down here.

00:50:50.036 --> 00:50:51.209
SAM: Oh boy.

00:50:51.209 --> 00:50:53.525
ASHLEY and MATT: (chuckle)

00:50:53.525 --> 00:50:56.921
MATT: I will say, because you are technically still blinded,

00:50:56.921 --> 00:50:59.387
since you didn't look at the lure last time

00:50:59.387 --> 00:51:01.138
and it's right in front of you still.

00:51:03.551 --> 00:51:04.608
It says

00:51:04.608 --> 00:51:07.041
it automatically fails any
ability check that requires sight.

00:51:08.621 --> 00:51:10.481
I will say, because you're a crazy barbarian who's raging.

00:51:10.481 --> 00:51:11.966
And are you, at this point [inaudible]

00:51:11.966 --> 00:51:14.159
I'll let you roll against it to see if you can resist.

00:51:14.159 --> 00:51:17.691
So go ahead and roll a strength saving throw for me

00:51:17.691 --> 00:51:19.111
with disadvantage.
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:51:19.111 --> 00:51:19.961
MATT: Which you have--

00:51:21.242 --> 00:51:23.201
Well, not--

00:51:23.201 --> 00:51:24.921
yeah, saving throw. Do you have
advantage in strength saving throws

00:51:24.921 --> 00:51:26.387
while raging, or is it just ability checks?

00:51:26.387 --> 00:51:28.161
ASHLEY: Just dex.

00:51:28.161 --> 00:51:30.461
I have advantage on the saving throw.

00:51:30.461 --> 00:51:32.122
MATT: Right, but for when you're raging,

00:51:32.122 --> 00:51:35.298
is it just ability checks or is it--?
ASHLEY: Oh, oh, oh, oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

00:51:35.298 --> 00:51:36.131
MATT: It's okay.

00:51:36.131 --> 00:51:37.728
ASHLEY: Let me check.

00:51:38.982 --> 00:51:40.811
SAM: Double check.
ASHLEY: Gain advantage on, yeah,

00:51:40.811 --> 00:51:41.941
strength checks and saving throws.

00:51:41.941 --> 00:51:42.774
MATT: So yeah.

00:51:42.774 --> 00:51:44.440
So it would just be a straight roll, so whatever you roll.

00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:46.311
ASHLEY: Okay. That would be 21.

00:51:46.311 --> 00:51:47.814
MATT: 21? You are not grappled.

00:51:47.814 --> 00:51:48.801
(various sounds of relief)
SAM: Oh, nice.

00:51:48.801 --> 00:51:50.712
MATT: You feel the arms pull at you, and as you do,

00:51:50.712 --> 00:51:52.921
you just shrug them off and put the blade in front

00:51:52.921 --> 00:51:54.991
even though with your eyes closed,

00:51:54.991 --> 00:51:55.981
you sensed where they were coming

00:51:55.981 --> 00:51:57.125
and managed to keep them at bay.

00:51:57.125 --> 00:51:58.717
LAURA: That was such a Jedi.

00:51:58.717 --> 00:52:00.781
ASHLEY: Yeah. (whooshing)
MATT: All right.

00:52:00.781 --> 00:52:02.731
Very cool. Now it's Veth's turn and then we'll be

00:52:02.731 --> 00:52:04.177
at the top of the round after that.

00:52:04.177 --> 00:52:05.281
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:52:05.281 --> 00:52:10.221
SAM: I will jump down and run over there.

00:52:10.221 --> 00:52:11.491
How much?

00:52:11.491 --> 00:52:13.593
Hi. Can I get there?

00:52:13.593 --> 00:52:15.552
MATT: Well, first, I need you to make a wisdom saving throw.

00:52:15.552 --> 00:52:16.999
SAM: Sure, sure.

00:52:16.999 --> 00:52:18.861
Easy enough, 19.

00:52:18.861 --> 00:52:20.098
MATT: 19? You're fine.

00:52:20.098 --> 00:52:21.306
LAURA: Yeah.

00:52:21.306 --> 00:52:23.839
MATT: (chuckling) What are you doing?

00:52:23.839 --> 00:52:26.211
SAM: I'm going to run over to its gullet,

00:52:26.211 --> 00:52:27.468
its toothy maw.

00:52:27.468 --> 00:52:29.194
(laughter)

00:52:29.194 --> 00:52:30.509
LIAM: Go get him, Brenatto.

00:52:30.509 --> 00:52:31.971
MARISHA: Ugh.
LAURA: Oh god.

00:52:31.971 --> 00:52:33.341
LAURA: It goes so poorly.
MARISHA: I know.

00:52:33.341 --> 00:52:35.111
SAM: So before I dive in--

00:52:35.111 --> 00:52:35.947
MATT: Yeah?

00:52:37.019 --> 00:52:38.609
SAM: Have I used all my movement...

00:52:42.581 --> 00:52:44.391
and what do I need to do to get in?

00:52:44.391 --> 00:52:45.561
MATT: 25 feet you've used.

00:52:45.561 --> 00:52:48.731
SAM: Okay. Do I need to-- is it movement to get in?

00:52:48.731 --> 00:52:50.624
Is it an action to get in?

00:52:51.681 --> 00:52:54.474
MATT: It is an action to reach in

00:52:54.474 --> 00:52:56.971
and try and resist to pull the creature out.

00:52:56.971 --> 00:52:59.489
So that'll be the end of your movement.

00:52:59.489 --> 00:53:01.601
You won't be able to pull her away from it,

00:53:01.601 --> 00:53:02.751
but she'll be out of it.

00:53:02.751 --> 00:53:03.584
LIAM: Yeah.

00:53:03.584 --> 00:53:04.991
SAM: And--
LIAM: You're right there.

00:53:04.991 --> 00:53:09.189
SAM: -- can I drink a potion as a bonus action?

00:53:10.443 --> 00:53:12.047
MARISHA: While jogging?

00:53:13.181 --> 00:53:14.601
MATT: With all that you're trying to do on this round?

00:53:14.601 --> 00:53:16.267
I'd say no.
SAM: That's okay.

00:53:16.267 --> 00:53:18.939
MATT: Yeah. You're doing a lot this round.
SAM: Sure, sure, sure.

00:53:18.939 --> 00:53:20.833
I'm just not the strongest person.

00:53:23.703 --> 00:53:25.231
TALIESIN: Just roll well.

00:53:25.231 --> 00:53:26.731
SAM: Yeah, I'll just roll well, guys.

00:53:26.731 --> 00:53:27.950
TALIESIN: Man, it's so simple.

00:53:27.950 --> 00:53:29.364
MATT: I mean, that's D&amp;D.

00:53:29.364 --> 00:53:32.360
LAURA: Just roll a fucking 20.

00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:33.981
SAM: Bless?
LAURA: I can't--

00:53:33.981 --> 00:53:35.169
SAM: I'm going to bless myself.

00:53:35.169 --> 00:53:37.041
(laughter)

00:53:37.041 --> 00:53:38.459
That's what you do, you touch your heart.
MATT: All right.

00:53:38.459 --> 00:53:40.981
So you're trying to push in and grab a hold of Beauregard.

00:53:40.981 --> 00:53:43.301
SAM: I'm going to reach in and pull.

00:53:43.301 --> 00:53:45.571
MATT: All right. So it's easy for you enough to get inside.

00:53:45.571 --> 00:53:47.251
And you can see, like, pushing

00:53:47.251 --> 00:53:50.298
past the teeth as they scrape, as you squeeze your way in.

00:53:50.298 --> 00:53:53.901
And it's this horrible, gnarled flesh flaps

00:53:53.901 --> 00:53:56.211
that you have to pull apart and squeeze in.

00:53:56.211 --> 00:53:59.021
And as you push your way in your feet are just sticking out.

00:53:59.021 --> 00:54:01.091
You guys watch as Veth almost entirely vanishes,

00:54:01.091 --> 00:54:02.491
actually the only person who sees this would be you,

00:54:02.491 --> 00:54:03.421
but you don't see that because you're blind.

00:54:03.421 --> 00:54:04.361
Nobody sees this.

00:54:04.361 --> 00:54:05.257
You remember this.

00:54:05.257 --> 00:54:06.954
(laughter)

00:54:06.954 --> 00:54:10.311
This is what the mind's eye of the audience sees.

00:54:10.311 --> 00:54:12.977
Is Veth's feet kicking as you reach in--

00:54:12.977 --> 00:54:14.568
ASHLEY: What's happening?

00:54:14.568 --> 00:54:16.001
MATT: -- as Beauregard is currently--

00:54:16.001 --> 00:54:17.241
SAM: I'm going to yell: I'm going in!

00:54:17.241 --> 00:54:19.660
As I dive in.
MATT: There you go.

00:54:19.660 --> 00:54:22.981
You do find Beauregard's arm.

00:54:22.981 --> 00:54:25.581
I need you to make a contested

00:54:25.581 --> 00:54:27.131
strength check.

00:54:27.131 --> 00:54:28.311
SAM: Strength check against a baby?

00:54:28.311 --> 00:54:30.094
How hard could it be?

00:54:30.094 --> 00:54:32.286
TRAVIS: You got this.
LAURA: Natural 20.

00:54:32.286 --> 00:54:33.411
SAM: Just my strength?

00:54:33.411 --> 00:54:34.778
MATT: Just your strength. Add your strength modifier.

00:54:34.778 --> 00:54:35.623
SAM: 12.

00:54:35.623 --> 00:54:36.791
(groaning)

00:54:36.791 --> 00:54:39.106
MATT: That does not succeed.

00:54:39.106 --> 00:54:41.351
SAM: (yelling)

00:54:41.351 --> 00:54:42.268
It's not moving!

00:54:43.151 --> 00:54:44.961
MATT: The good news is--
MARISHA: Veth!

00:54:44.961 --> 00:54:47.701
MATT: The good news is you got 113 points

00:54:47.701 --> 00:54:49.001
of additional damage from Fjord's turn.

00:54:49.001 --> 00:54:51.163
The bad news is it woke it up and

00:54:51.163 --> 00:54:52.220
now it can resist being pulled out.

00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:54.351
SAM: No problem, no problem.

00:54:54.351 --> 00:54:57.331
MATT: But you are now--
SAM: Sure.

00:54:57.331 --> 00:54:59.381
MATT: -- prone, and partially in its mouth.

00:54:59.381 --> 00:55:02.231
SAM: Sure. I'm holding on real tight.

00:55:02.231 --> 00:55:03.189
MATT: Okay. You got it.

00:55:03.189 --> 00:55:05.951
That finishes your turn. Yasha, you're up.

00:55:05.951 --> 00:55:06.784
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:55:06.784 --> 00:55:07.841
MATT: Are you--

00:55:07.841 --> 00:55:09.561
Are you keeping your eyes closed

00:55:09.561 --> 00:55:12.336
or are you going to risk the wisdom save?

00:55:12.336 --> 00:55:14.211
ASHLEY: (sighs) Wisdom save.

00:55:14.211 --> 00:55:15.471
MATT: Go for it. Make the roll.

00:55:15.471 --> 00:55:16.401
SAM: You got to look.

00:55:16.401 --> 00:55:18.271
ASHLEY: I got to look.
SAM: You don't know what the fuck's going on.

00:55:18.271 --> 00:55:20.343
You just heard me run by you.

00:55:20.343 --> 00:55:21.341
And it's crazy.

00:55:21.341 --> 00:55:24.101
MARISHA: Come on, please.

00:55:24.101 --> 00:55:25.186
Natural 19.

00:55:25.186 --> 00:55:26.921
LIAM: Yes!
(cheering)

00:55:26.921 --> 00:55:27.851
ASHLEY: Okay.
MATT: With your penalty,

00:55:27.851 --> 00:55:29.317
it brings it to?

00:55:29.317 --> 00:55:30.150
ASHLEY: 20.

00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:32.281
MATT: There we go, just making sure.

00:55:32.281 --> 00:55:34.239
ASHLEY: Plus one.

00:55:34.239 --> 00:55:35.466
MATT: Resisted. You're good. What are you doing?

00:55:35.466 --> 00:55:37.740
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.
MARISHA: I might live.

00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:40.178
ASHLEY: All right, all right, all right.

00:55:41.378 --> 00:55:43.111
Well, now I got to pull both of you guys out.

00:55:43.111 --> 00:55:45.202
So let me--

00:55:45.202 --> 00:55:46.443
MARISHA: Do I have your arms?

00:55:46.443 --> 00:55:48.770
Do I see Veth? Do I see a little--

00:55:48.770 --> 00:55:50.191
MATT: Yeah, Veth is holding your arm.

00:55:50.191 --> 00:55:51.731
You don't see anything right now,

00:55:51.731 --> 00:55:53.718
but you feel Veth grabbing onto you,

00:55:53.718 --> 00:55:55.181
and you can just barely make out

00:55:55.181 --> 00:55:56.621
that there is somebody trying to get you out of it.

00:55:56.621 --> 00:55:58.423
MARISHA: Okay. I'm full on gripping Veth's arms.

00:55:58.423 --> 00:55:59.256
MATT: You got it.

00:55:59.256 --> 00:56:00.645
ASHLEY: Okay. So real quick.

00:56:00.645 --> 00:56:01.745
SAM: Hope you don't slip!

00:56:03.211 --> 00:56:04.904
ASHLEY: Because I'm so angry,

00:56:07.233 --> 00:56:09.615
I'm also going to let out a battle cry.

00:56:09.615 --> 00:56:10.448
MATT: Okay.

00:56:10.448 --> 00:56:13.642
ASHLEY: So everybody, you know, you get

00:56:13.642 --> 00:56:15.891
advantages on attack rolls and saving throws.

00:56:15.891 --> 00:56:16.974
MATT: Awesome.

00:56:16.974 --> 00:56:19.218
TALIESIN: That's a bonus action?
ASHLEY: Bonus action.

00:56:19.218 --> 00:56:24.218
And then I'm going to just reach in and try to pull Veth's

00:56:25.552 --> 00:56:27.431
ankles, hips, something.

00:56:27.431 --> 00:56:29.121
Anything I can grab to try to pull them all out.

00:56:29.121 --> 00:56:31.180
MATT: As you grab Veth's feet,

00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:32.761
go ahead and make a strength check

00:56:32.761 --> 00:56:34.431
with advantage because you are raging and

00:56:34.431 --> 00:56:36.504
because you are eyes open on this.

00:56:37.549 --> 00:56:38.899
LIAM: That halfling over there.

00:56:40.211 --> 00:56:41.871
ASHLEY: Nice. Okay.

00:56:41.871 --> 00:56:44.771
LAURA: Wait, advantage, advantage?
ASHLEY: Plus advantage.

00:56:44.771 --> 00:56:45.951
Whew. Thank goodness.

00:56:45.951 --> 00:56:47.959
I rolled a one and an 18.

00:56:47.959 --> 00:56:49.301
So 28.

00:56:49.301 --> 00:56:50.592
MATT: You had to beat a 22.

00:56:50.592 --> 00:56:52.771
TRAVIS: (whooping)
MARISHA: A 22.

00:56:52.771 --> 00:56:55.091
MATT: So as you reach and grab, you put your feet up

00:56:55.091 --> 00:56:57.591
against the side and pull on Veth's legs

00:56:57.591 --> 00:57:02.524
and in a full-on-- a sight that you can only imagine,

00:57:02.524 --> 00:57:04.901
you pull both the halfling, Veth,

00:57:04.901 --> 00:57:07.121
and your friend, Beauregard, from the gullet

00:57:07.121 --> 00:57:10.229
of this terrifying abomination,

00:57:10.229 --> 00:57:12.829
leaving both Veth and Beauregard prone on the ground,

00:57:12.829 --> 00:57:15.686
but not within its stomach

00:57:15.686 --> 00:57:17.260
TALIESIN: And boom!
MARISHA: (gasping)

00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:18.460
TALIESIN: Boom goes my dynamite.

00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:19.868
TRAVIS: Yes. Just your--
LIAM: Healing and death.

00:57:19.868 --> 00:57:20.911
TALIESIN: 70 points.

00:57:20.911 --> 00:57:22.481
MATT: You heal 70 hit points.
MARISHA: 70 points?

00:57:22.481 --> 00:57:23.864
LAURA: And you were holding Disintegrate.

00:57:23.864 --> 00:57:24.751
LIAM: Disintegrate goes off.

00:57:24.751 --> 00:57:26.393
MATT: Yes, it does.

00:57:26.393 --> 00:57:29.586
TRAVIS: Fucking awesome.
ASHLEY: Come on!

00:57:29.586 --> 00:57:31.393
SAM: We reverse birthed a baby.

00:57:31.393 --> 00:57:33.586
(laughter)

00:57:33.586 --> 00:57:34.686
TALIESIN: It's a teammate!

00:57:35.611 --> 00:57:36.917
MATT: All righty.

00:57:36.917 --> 00:57:38.961
And what's what's the save against it?

00:57:38.961 --> 00:57:41.646
LIAM: Dex.
MATT: Dex? Okay.

00:57:41.646 --> 00:57:42.479
Not great at them.

00:57:44.091 --> 00:57:47.371
All right. It will use one of
its legendary saves to succeed.

00:57:47.371 --> 00:57:50.566
LIAM: Oh, so no damage.
MATT: No damage.

00:57:50.566 --> 00:57:52.195
LIAM: It goes shy or bounces off.

00:57:52.195 --> 00:57:54.471
TRAVIS: Wow.
MARISHA: What level were you trying to do?

00:57:54.471 --> 00:57:55.915
LIAM: 6th-level.

00:57:55.915 --> 00:57:56.748
TRAVIS: Nuke.

00:57:56.748 --> 00:57:57.581
LIAM: I wasn't going to go higher.

00:57:57.581 --> 00:57:58.701
It's better to do it twice.

00:57:58.701 --> 00:57:59.731
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:57:59.731 --> 00:58:00.564
LIAM: Up one.

00:58:00.564 --> 00:58:02.311
MATT: Yeah. All righty.

00:58:02.311 --> 00:58:04.401
LIAM: Fuck.
MARISHA: Lame.

00:58:04.401 --> 00:58:06.576
MATT: Beauregard, it's your turn.

00:58:06.576 --> 00:58:09.041
MARISHA: (deep sigh) Okay.
TALIESIN: Actually, we're together.

00:58:09.041 --> 00:58:09.874
Can I go first?

00:58:11.261 --> 00:58:12.214
MARISHA: Oh, yeah.

00:58:13.171 --> 00:58:14.811
TALIESIN: Just 'cause?

00:58:14.811 --> 00:58:16.061
MATT: Sure.
TALIESIN: All right.

00:58:16.061 --> 00:58:17.301
Since we're both--

00:58:17.301 --> 00:58:19.291
MATT: Well, I will--
TALIESIN: Oh, your dex is higher.

00:58:19.291 --> 00:58:21.411
MATT: Her dex is higher,
and I usually go with that circumstance.

00:58:21.411 --> 00:58:22.931
And since you guys aren't coordinating

00:58:22.931 --> 00:58:24.611
because she literally just got pulled

00:58:24.611 --> 00:58:25.721
out of the inside the creature,

00:58:25.721 --> 00:58:28.301
she wouldn't know to wait. So, Beauregard, go for it.

00:58:28.301 --> 00:58:32.344
MARISHA: Okay. Dripping stomach acid and bile.

00:58:33.231 --> 00:58:35.424
Super pissed off.

00:58:36.591 --> 00:58:39.502
Stand up, pull out my staff

00:58:39.502 --> 00:58:40.335
and I'm going to just start trying

00:58:40.335 --> 00:58:42.508
to gouge its eyes out.

00:58:42.508 --> 00:58:43.341
MATT: Go for it.

00:58:43.341 --> 00:58:46.238
LAURA: Do you have to make a wisdom save
at the beginning of your turn?

00:58:46.238 --> 00:58:47.137
MATT: You do.

00:58:47.137 --> 00:58:48.287
SAM: Oh, balls.

00:58:48.287 --> 00:58:51.633
MATT: Unless you want to avert your gaze.

00:58:51.633 --> 00:58:53.401
LIAM: Yeah, you do. You got like 50 hits.

00:58:53.401 --> 00:58:54.821
LAURA: Yeah.

00:58:54.821 --> 00:58:56.035
MATT: Your call.

00:58:56.035 --> 00:58:58.121
Do you want to risk the wisdom save,

00:58:58.121 --> 00:58:59.731
or do you want to choose to keep your eyes closed

00:58:59.731 --> 00:59:01.128
and be blind for the rest of the turn?

00:59:01.128 --> 00:59:04.349
MARISHA: Well, I also have attacks
on all saving throws right now, right?

00:59:04.349 --> 00:59:06.340
MATT: You have advantage on all saving throws.

00:59:06.340 --> 00:59:07.614
MARISHA: This is a saving throw, right?
MATT: Correct.

00:59:07.614 --> 00:59:09.725
MARISHA: So I'll do it. I'll risk it.

00:59:09.725 --> 00:59:10.883
MATT: Okay.

00:59:10.883 --> 00:59:13.724
MARISHA: Realistically, I just roll above a 10.

00:59:13.724 --> 00:59:15.796
I rolled a natural 19 on that one,

00:59:15.796 --> 00:59:18.853
and that one's gone, but that's a 19.

00:59:18.853 --> 00:59:20.770
MATT: You got it. Okay.
MARISHA: Okay. Okay.

00:59:22.431 --> 00:59:26.561
MATT: So I imagine you get up first.

00:59:26.561 --> 00:59:27.802
It's right in your face.

00:59:27.802 --> 00:59:29.764
Literally. It's, like, shining and you're like,

00:59:29.764 --> 00:59:32.851
"Get out of the way!" and just go to town on this.

00:59:32.851 --> 00:59:37.851
MARISHA: Yeah. Just full on my grip goes around my staff

00:59:37.951 --> 00:59:41.673
and I just battle baseball swing at its face.

00:59:41.673 --> 00:59:43.211
MATT: Go for it.

00:59:43.211 --> 00:59:44.950
MARISHA: Okay.

00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:46.074
First attack.

00:59:48.098 --> 00:59:49.651
27.
MATT: That hits.

00:59:49.651 --> 00:59:51.431
MARISHA: Second-- second attack.

00:59:51.431 --> 00:59:52.947
Natural 20.

00:59:52.947 --> 00:59:55.716
MATT: All right.
MARISHA: So first attack.

00:59:56.824 --> 00:59:59.001
TRAVIS: What's for dinner.

00:59:59.001 --> 01:00:01.101
MARISHA: 14 damage.
MATT: 14 damage.

01:00:01.101 --> 01:00:03.817
MARISHA: Second attack. Please be an eight.

01:00:03.817 --> 01:00:05.944
It's an eight!

01:00:05.944 --> 01:00:07.361
18 damage.

01:00:07.361 --> 01:00:09.081
(laughter)

01:00:09.081 --> 01:00:13.816
TALIESIN: All of these are advantage, too.

01:00:13.816 --> 01:00:16.013
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
TALIESIN: Fuck, I'm sorry.

01:00:16.013 --> 01:00:19.280
MATT: Wait, so you rolled an eight.
So it's doubled to 16, plus your--

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:20.782
MARISHA: Plus... Oh, you're right.

01:00:20.782 --> 01:00:23.371
16. That's technically 28.

01:00:23.371 --> 01:00:24.204
I'm wrong.

01:00:24.204 --> 01:00:25.560
Not 18, 28.

01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:26.701
MATT: Not 28.

01:00:26.701 --> 01:00:28.894
What was the full modifier on it?

01:00:30.621 --> 01:00:32.847
MARISHA: Sorry. Sorry. Plus 10.

01:00:32.847 --> 01:00:34.901
So 27.
MATT: Plus 10 damage?

01:00:34.901 --> 01:00:37.501
MARISHA: Yeah, on my Belaborer, because it gives me a

01:00:37.501 --> 01:00:39.431
plus two to my attack and damage.

01:00:39.431 --> 01:00:41.229
MATT: Correct. And then you have five for your dex.

01:00:41.229 --> 01:00:42.976
That's plus seven, right?

01:00:45.781 --> 01:00:47.511
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:00:47.511 --> 01:00:48.561
Well, then why is that

01:00:51.171 --> 01:00:52.019
not right?

01:00:52.019 --> 01:00:52.852
SAM: But why?

01:00:53.901 --> 01:00:54.881
MATT: Double checking the damage on them.

01:00:54.881 --> 01:00:56.271
MARISHA: 1d8.

01:00:56.271 --> 01:00:57.324
Okay. Okay.

01:01:01.531 --> 01:01:03.321
I was already adding in the damage.

01:01:03.321 --> 01:01:04.331
I was already adding it in.

01:01:04.331 --> 01:01:05.441
Okay. Okay.

01:01:05.441 --> 01:01:09.401
So yes, but I guess my unarmed strikes are what's plus six.

01:01:09.401 --> 01:01:10.581
Not my staff.

01:01:10.581 --> 01:01:12.001
MATT: Well, you can do with the staff attacks, too,

01:01:12.001 --> 01:01:14.891
but just saying that it's plus five

01:01:14.891 --> 01:01:16.476
with your dex damage

01:01:16.476 --> 01:01:17.941
and then whatever the weapon's damage bonus is

01:01:17.941 --> 01:01:21.771
on top of that, which should be two with Belabor, right?

01:01:21.771 --> 01:01:22.604
MARISHA: Yes.

01:01:22.604 --> 01:01:23.437
MATT: So it'd be plus seven.
MARISHA: Plus seven.

01:01:23.437 --> 01:01:26.351
MATT: Correct, so it'd be 23 damage.
MARISHA: So I was one off on that, 23 damage.

01:01:26.351 --> 01:01:27.641
MATT: What would be the first strike, then, that you rolled?

01:01:27.641 --> 01:01:28.541
MARISHA: Let me fix that.

01:01:29.411 --> 01:01:31.351
It would be minus

01:01:34.351 --> 01:01:35.420
three.

01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:37.361
MATT: Okay, gotcha.
MARISHA: Because I was adding this wrong.

01:01:37.361 --> 01:01:39.953
MATT: Love it. Okay. Good to fix that now.

01:01:39.953 --> 01:01:43.496
LAURA: Mm. Yes. Obviously.
TRAVIS: Carry the one, and--

01:01:44.659 --> 01:01:46.881
MATT: All righty. That's your action?

01:01:46.881 --> 01:01:47.714
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:01:48.631 --> 01:01:52.001
I might as well try to Stunning Strike it,
I guess, if he's alive.

01:01:52.001 --> 01:01:53.461
MATT: Okay, he's alive.

01:01:53.461 --> 01:01:54.294
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:01:54.294 --> 01:01:55.421
MATT: He's starting to look rough, guys.

01:01:56.431 --> 01:01:57.474
TRAVIS: Don't you lie to us.

01:01:58.361 --> 01:01:59.661
MATT: Okay.

01:01:59.661 --> 01:02:01.491
TALIESIN: I mean, he looked rough when he showed up.

01:02:01.491 --> 01:02:03.911
MATT: True. True.

01:02:03.911 --> 01:02:06.741
It does not appear to have an effect on it.

01:02:06.741 --> 01:02:08.258
MARISHA: It can't be stunned.

01:02:08.258 --> 01:02:09.279
MATT: It doesn't seem to have an effect.

01:02:09.279 --> 01:02:10.121
TRAVIS: Oh boy.

01:02:10.121 --> 01:02:13.001
MARISHA: Okay. Bonus action.

01:02:13.001 --> 01:02:15.151
Pop pop.
MATT: Go for it.

01:02:15.151 --> 01:02:17.001
SAM: You have to do, what is it, the five S's?

01:02:17.001 --> 01:02:17.834
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:02:17.834 --> 01:02:20.091
SAM: (rhythmic shushing)

01:02:20.091 --> 01:02:25.083
MARISHA: Okay. The first one is a 25.

01:02:25.083 --> 01:02:26.531
MATT: 25 hits, yeah.

01:02:26.531 --> 01:02:28.478
MARISHA: Second one is

01:02:30.341 --> 01:02:32.204
a 23.

01:02:32.204 --> 01:02:33.037
MATT: That hits.

01:02:35.081 --> 01:02:37.818
MARISHA: These are-- okay.

01:02:38.753 --> 01:02:40.521
SAM: ♪ (sings with background music) ♪

01:02:40.521 --> 01:02:44.531
MARISHA: That is the first strike is, lordy.

01:02:44.531 --> 01:02:48.381
Plus-- is 12 damage and 10 damage.

01:02:48.381 --> 01:02:51.188
So 22 on that. Flurry of Blows.

01:02:51.188 --> 01:02:52.141
MATT: You got it. All right.

01:02:52.141 --> 01:02:56.461
MARISHA: And Extract Aspects.
MATT: Okay. Good to know.

01:02:56.461 --> 01:02:58.661
This creature, of its odd

01:02:59.871 --> 01:03:02.441
physicality and biology.

01:03:02.441 --> 01:03:04.891
You sense as you come out of its body

01:03:04.891 --> 01:03:07.031
both of the experience being inside of it

01:03:07.031 --> 01:03:09.091
and now being able to connect your chi

01:03:09.091 --> 01:03:11.281
with whatever its spiritual energy is.

01:03:11.281 --> 01:03:12.565
You can sense that it is

01:03:12.565 --> 01:03:15.231
resistant to fire, cold, and lightning.

01:03:15.231 --> 01:03:16.851
MARISHA: Resistant to fire, cold, and lightning.

01:03:16.851 --> 01:03:20.831
MATT: As well as bludgeoning, slashing,
and piercing from nonmagical attacks.

01:03:20.831 --> 01:03:23.151
MARISHA: Okay.
MATT: It is immune to acid.

01:03:23.151 --> 01:03:23.984
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:03:23.984 --> 01:03:26.661
MATT: And it can not be charmed, stunned or frightened.

01:03:26.661 --> 01:03:29.491
MARISHA: Okay. Can't be charmed, stunned, or frightened.

01:03:29.491 --> 01:03:30.651
SAM: Just like a baby.

01:03:30.651 --> 01:03:31.629
MARISHA: Okay.

01:03:31.629 --> 01:03:33.821
(chuckling)

01:03:33.821 --> 01:03:35.131
Charmed, stunned, or frightened.

01:03:35.131 --> 01:03:36.221
Okay. All right.

01:03:36.221 --> 01:03:40.261
So I just say like: Avoid elemental shit

01:03:40.261 --> 01:03:42.374
and stuff that fucks with its head.

01:03:42.374 --> 01:03:43.632
LAURA: (whispered) No, it's a wisdom.

01:03:43.632 --> 01:03:45.461
MARISHA: It's a wise baby.

01:03:45.461 --> 01:03:46.412
MATT: That finish your turn?

01:03:46.412 --> 01:03:49.181
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: Caduceus, now you're up.

01:03:49.181 --> 01:03:50.014
TALIESIN: Okay.

01:03:50.014 --> 01:03:50.951
MATT: Actually, at the end of your turn--

01:03:50.951 --> 01:03:51.951
TALIESIN: Yeah.
MATT: -- because I can do that.

01:03:51.951 --> 01:03:54.400
SAM: Legendary action.
MARISHA: No!

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:56.930
MATT: It's going to go ahead and attempt--

01:04:05.841 --> 01:04:09.982
Yeah. It's going to attempt another
grasping arms against Veth.

01:04:09.982 --> 01:04:11.651
SAM: Against me?
MATT: Yes.

01:04:11.651 --> 01:04:13.259
SAM: No problem.
LAURA: It's got a taste for you, Veth.

01:04:13.259 --> 01:04:14.650
It wants you back.

01:04:14.650 --> 01:04:16.141
SAM: Yeah!
MATT: Because you're right there.

01:04:16.141 --> 01:04:17.061
So I need you to

01:04:17.061 --> 01:04:22.061
make a contested athletics or dexterity.

01:04:22.361 --> 01:04:23.951
Acrobatics check, your choice.

01:04:23.951 --> 01:04:25.701
SAM: Oh.

01:04:25.701 --> 01:04:26.721
MARISHA: Is this an attack?

01:04:26.721 --> 01:04:30.457
SAM: This is a check, save?
MATT: A contested check.

01:04:30.457 --> 01:04:31.482
SAM: 20.

01:04:31.482 --> 01:04:32.981
MATT: 23.

01:04:32.981 --> 01:04:34.247
So you are grappled by the arms.

01:04:34.247 --> 01:04:35.469
SAM: Wait.

01:04:35.469 --> 01:04:37.569
Wait.
MATT: Wait.

01:04:37.569 --> 01:04:38.927
TALIESIN and LIAM: Wait.
MARISHA: Rogue shit.

01:04:38.927 --> 01:04:42.371
SAM: That green A that's next to my acrobatics.

01:04:42.371 --> 01:04:43.371
I finally looked it up.

01:04:43.371 --> 01:04:47.312
It says advantage on escape from being grappled.

01:04:47.312 --> 01:04:48.478
Squat Nimbleness.

01:04:48.478 --> 01:04:49.562
MATT: So roll again.

01:04:49.562 --> 01:04:50.672
TRAVIS: Yeah!

01:04:52.354 --> 01:04:53.784
SAM: 22.

01:04:53.784 --> 01:04:54.954
MATT: It's one below.

01:04:54.954 --> 01:04:56.481
(laughter)

01:04:56.481 --> 01:04:58.200
But good try!

01:04:58.200 --> 01:04:59.033
Good try.

01:04:59.033 --> 01:05:00.024
TRAVIS: It was one below.
MATT: Yeah.

01:05:00.024 --> 01:05:01.982
(laughter)

01:05:01.982 --> 01:05:03.423
TRAVIS: Shit!

01:05:03.423 --> 01:05:08.031
MATT: So Veth, you are grappled by it.

01:05:08.031 --> 01:05:12.814
All right. That finishes its legendary reaction.

01:05:12.814 --> 01:05:14.081
Your turn.

01:05:14.081 --> 01:05:17.091
TALIESIN: Do I have to make a saving throw or are we cool?

01:05:17.091 --> 01:05:17.991
MATT: You are--

01:05:17.991 --> 01:05:21.521
TRAVIS: "Or are we cool."
MARISHA: Is that Caduceus talking to the baby?

01:05:21.521 --> 01:05:23.801
MATT: You do,

01:05:23.801 --> 01:05:28.221
unless you choose not to. You do have advantage on it.

01:05:28.221 --> 01:05:29.054
TALIESIN: Yeah. I'll take it.

01:05:29.054 --> 01:05:31.054
MATT: Go for it.
TALIESIN: I got shit I want to do.

01:05:33.091 --> 01:05:34.021
TALIESIN: 18?

01:05:34.021 --> 01:05:36.038
MATT: 18 is fine, so you are good.

01:05:37.101 --> 01:05:37.934
TALIESIN: Okay.

01:05:39.711 --> 01:05:41.906
5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30.

01:05:41.906 --> 01:05:45.086
I'm going to step just so that

01:05:45.086 --> 01:05:47.912
Veth is within 30 feet of me.

01:05:47.912 --> 01:05:48.745
MATT: Okay.

01:05:53.463 --> 01:05:55.380
TALIESIN: And I'm going to cast...

01:05:57.921 --> 01:06:01.854
One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four.

01:06:04.031 --> 01:06:05.261
And I can see Yasha,

01:06:05.261 --> 01:06:07.334
I believe, over the top of the baby.

01:06:08.541 --> 01:06:11.071
MATT: You cannot see Yasha right now.

01:06:11.071 --> 01:06:12.391
TALIESIN: Oh, shit.

01:06:12.391 --> 01:06:13.691
That-- that sucks.

01:06:13.691 --> 01:06:15.131
MATT: Yeah, you can only right now

01:06:15.131 --> 01:06:20.131
see Veth barely, Beauregard, and Jester's duplicate,

01:06:20.782 --> 01:06:22.955
TALIESIN: Other than the other kids.
MATT: And the people around you.

01:06:22.955 --> 01:06:24.329
I mean, as far as that side.

01:06:24.329 --> 01:06:26.841
TALIESIN: How far would I have to go to see, uh--

01:06:26.841 --> 01:06:28.431
I would have to like step another 10 feet,

01:06:28.431 --> 01:06:30.691
wouldn't I, to see Yasha?

01:06:30.691 --> 01:06:31.721
MATT: Yeah.

01:06:31.721 --> 01:06:33.421
TALIESIN: How far have I traveled already?

01:06:35.211 --> 01:06:36.044
MATT: 10 feet.

01:06:39.936 --> 01:06:42.986
TALIESIN: Okay, I'll step forward until I can see Yasha,

01:06:42.986 --> 01:06:44.499
which was either five or 10 feet.

01:06:44.499 --> 01:06:46.287
MATT: Okay. That'll put you about there.

01:06:46.287 --> 01:06:47.461
TALIESIN: Is that 10 feet?

01:06:47.461 --> 01:06:49.436
MATT: That'd be technically 15.

01:06:50.964 --> 01:06:52.282
TALIESIN: Oh shit.

01:06:53.181 --> 01:06:54.321
MATT: Yeah. It's tough.

01:06:54.321 --> 01:06:55.991
It's blocking your path for the most part.

01:06:55.991 --> 01:06:57.075
TALIESIN: Sure. Okay. Fuck it.

01:06:57.075 --> 01:06:59.157
This is how the game plays. This is how the game works.

01:06:59.157 --> 01:07:00.411
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: All right.

01:07:00.411 --> 01:07:02.669
One, two, three, four, five, so--

01:07:04.001 --> 01:07:06.051
So I'm going to cast--

01:07:07.559 --> 01:07:09.821
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

01:07:09.821 --> 01:07:11.601
I'm going to cast Bless

01:07:11.601 --> 01:07:14.001
at 5th-level.

01:07:14.001 --> 01:07:15.217
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: Whoa.

01:07:16.087 --> 01:07:18.121
TALIESIN: Everyone gets a...

01:07:21.821 --> 01:07:24.321
d4 with saving throws.

01:07:24.321 --> 01:07:26.011
LIAM: Everybody?
TALIESIN: Everybody.

01:07:26.011 --> 01:07:27.894
MATT: Nice.
LIAM: Good, good.

01:07:28.841 --> 01:07:30.685
And we have advantage on saving throws, right?

01:07:30.685 --> 01:07:31.935
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: For this round, yeah.

01:07:31.935 --> 01:07:32.951
TALIESIN: d4 to saving throws,

01:07:32.951 --> 01:07:34.231
d4 to attack rolls.

01:07:34.231 --> 01:07:35.064
LIAM: Okay, good.

01:07:35.064 --> 01:07:36.481
TALIESIN: And I'm going to take whatever I've got left

01:07:36.481 --> 01:07:38.481
to back the fuck away from this thing.

01:07:38.481 --> 01:07:39.661
MARISHA: Great.
MATT: You've got it.

01:07:39.661 --> 01:07:40.744
SAM: Hashtag blessed.

01:07:40.744 --> 01:07:43.341
MARISHA: Hashtag blessed, blessed.

01:07:43.341 --> 01:07:45.141
TRAVIS: Back yo ass up, Caduceus.

01:07:45.141 --> 01:07:47.866
TALIESIN: And, yeah.
ASHLEY: Hell yeah.

01:07:47.866 --> 01:07:49.407
MATT: All right, and you're backing up what?

01:07:49.407 --> 01:07:52.001
TALIESIN: As far as I can possibly go.

01:07:52.001 --> 01:07:53.583
I want to get away from that eye.

01:07:53.583 --> 01:07:55.124
I don't want to see it. I know what it does.

01:07:55.124 --> 01:07:56.541
MATT: That's as much as you can get right there

01:07:56.541 --> 01:07:57.374
with the movement you used,

01:07:57.374 --> 01:07:58.301
to get close enough to get Yasha

01:07:58.301 --> 01:07:59.691
in that blast wave, so.

01:07:59.691 --> 01:08:01.531
TALIESIN: All right, then I'll-- yeah.

01:08:02.644 --> 01:08:06.877
MATT: All right. We'll say that,
because I do not have a seventh one

01:08:06.877 --> 01:08:10.561
that this also represents Bless on you, Veth.

01:08:10.561 --> 01:08:11.394
All right.

01:08:11.394 --> 01:08:12.371
That finishes Caduceus' turn. Caleb, you're up.

01:08:12.371 --> 01:08:13.204
Jester, you're on deck.

01:08:13.204 --> 01:08:14.037
LIAM: Okay.

01:08:14.037 --> 01:08:15.611
So the bless is a d4?
TALIESIN: d4.

01:08:15.611 --> 01:08:16.444
LAURA: Yes.
LIAM: d4. Okay.

01:08:16.444 --> 01:08:18.311
So I have to-- first, I will--

01:08:18.311 --> 01:08:20.141
I'm not going to shut my eyes.
MATT: Okay.

01:08:20.141 --> 01:08:21.309
LIAM: So I'll make the save.

01:08:21.309 --> 01:08:23.034
MATT: With advantage, plus a d4 on each of them.

01:08:23.034 --> 01:08:24.083
LIAM: Do I roll a d4 for each 20,

01:08:24.083 --> 01:08:25.903
or for both, or I don't know.

01:08:25.903 --> 01:08:27.111
MATT: Just roll one,

01:08:27.111 --> 01:08:28.028
and then...

01:08:30.661 --> 01:08:32.071
LIAM: Fuck.

01:08:32.071 --> 01:08:33.552
Well, that could do it.

01:08:33.552 --> 01:08:36.122
11 plus-- 20.

01:08:36.122 --> 01:08:38.071
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.
MATT: 20? Yeah, that'll do it.

01:08:38.071 --> 01:08:40.536
LIAM: I forgot that I get to add nine.

01:08:40.536 --> 01:08:44.531
Okay. So I will back up 20 feet from this thing,

01:08:44.531 --> 01:08:46.121
15 feet, let's say.

01:08:46.121 --> 01:08:47.711
MATT: 15 feet there.

01:08:47.711 --> 01:08:50.411
LIAM: And I am muttering and moving
my hands through the air.

01:08:50.411 --> 01:08:53.631
And I reach my hand out and focus on the eyeball

01:08:53.631 --> 01:08:54.711
dangling from its face

01:08:54.711 --> 01:08:56.631
and try to use Telekinesis to rip it

01:08:56.631 --> 01:08:58.369
off and throw it down the hall.

01:08:58.369 --> 01:08:59.202
SAM: Whoa.

01:08:59.202 --> 01:09:04.202
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll a d20,

01:09:05.011 --> 01:09:09.091
adding your intelligence modifier to it.

01:09:09.091 --> 01:09:10.881
ASHLEY: Do you get an advantage?

01:09:10.881 --> 01:09:11.714
MARISHA: Oh no.

01:09:11.714 --> 01:09:13.470
MATT: Not for this one, though.
TRAVIS: Say it.

01:09:13.470 --> 01:09:14.303
MARISHA: What is it?

01:09:14.303 --> 01:09:15.781
LIAM: It's not-- neither of those things.

01:09:15.781 --> 01:09:17.511
So adding which?

01:09:17.511 --> 01:09:18.721
MATT: Adding your intelligence modifier.

01:09:18.721 --> 01:09:19.601
LIAM: 15

01:09:19.601 --> 01:09:20.434
MATT: 15.

01:09:20.434 --> 01:09:23.211
Not strong enough to pull it free from its head.

01:09:23.211 --> 01:09:24.061
There's tension there.

01:09:24.061 --> 01:09:25.138
And you feel like if

01:09:25.138 --> 01:09:27.381
you were to continue to try, this is definitely possible,

01:09:27.381 --> 01:09:29.701
but right now with everything that's going on

01:09:29.701 --> 01:09:30.961
you're just having a hard time focusing

01:09:30.961 --> 01:09:33.128
and concentrating on it from the distance you're at

01:09:33.128 --> 01:09:35.141
and how much movement is between you and the creature.

01:09:35.141 --> 01:09:38.704
But you're trying, you're trying you're trained onto it.

01:09:38.704 --> 01:09:42.711
The rest of you watch as its floppy dangler is now taut,

01:09:42.711 --> 01:09:45.577
and being pulled like it's on the edge of

01:09:45.577 --> 01:09:48.658
a fishing line.
MARISHA: Oh, hi, I'm Floppy Danglers.

01:09:48.658 --> 01:09:50.633
LAURA: Ooh, I'm Floppy Dangler.

01:09:50.633 --> 01:09:52.833
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:09:52.833 --> 01:09:54.572
MATT: All right. That finishes your go, Caleb?

01:09:54.572 --> 01:09:55.717
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: All right.

01:09:55.717 --> 01:09:57.091
Jester, you're up.

01:09:57.091 --> 01:09:59.947
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to cast,

01:10:00.797 --> 01:10:02.774
because this is an attack sort of thing,

01:10:03.701 --> 01:10:04.991
a Guiding Bolt

01:10:05.851 --> 01:10:07.811
at fifth level.

01:10:07.811 --> 01:10:09.344
MARISHA: Up the butt.
MATT: Go for it.

01:10:10.911 --> 01:10:13.944
You do have an advantage on the attack because of Yasha.

01:10:13.944 --> 01:10:15.191
LAURA: Whoa, that was way cocked.

01:10:15.191 --> 01:10:17.081
MATT: Well, actually at the top of your turn,

01:10:17.081 --> 01:10:20.209
I need you to go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw, or...

01:10:20.209 --> 01:10:21.142
TRAVIS: Avert your gaze.

01:10:21.142 --> 01:10:23.131
LAURA: I should reroll.

01:10:23.131 --> 01:10:25.611
I shouldn't go based on the twenties I just rolled.

01:10:25.611 --> 01:10:27.291
Right?
MATT: Correct.

01:10:27.291 --> 01:10:28.751
But first, roll your wisdom saving throw

01:10:28.751 --> 01:10:30.611
with advantage because you do have her thing.

01:10:30.611 --> 01:10:31.561
LAURA: Right. That's what I did.

01:10:31.561 --> 01:10:35.796
So seven plus--

01:10:36.831 --> 01:10:38.770
eight plus 10, 18?

01:10:38.770 --> 01:10:39.641
MATT: 18 is fine.

01:10:39.641 --> 01:10:41.774
LAURA: Okay. So should I reroll my--

01:10:41.774 --> 01:10:43.331
MATT: Now you reroll your d20s for the attack.

01:10:43.331 --> 01:10:44.214
LAURA: Okay.

01:10:45.271 --> 01:10:47.201
It was really good before and that sucks

01:10:47.201 --> 01:10:48.344
because this is not as good as what I--

01:10:48.344 --> 01:10:49.821
TALIESIN: You also get a d4.
LAURA: Huh?

01:10:49.821 --> 01:10:50.941
TALIESIN: Attacks get a d4, too.

01:10:50.941 --> 01:10:52.691
MATT: Yeah.
LAURA: Sure. But...

01:10:55.271 --> 01:10:57.374
11 plus 10,

01:10:58.511 --> 01:10:59.971
21.
MATT: That hits.

01:10:59.971 --> 01:11:02.631
LAURA: All right, so that's 8d6.

01:11:02.631 --> 01:11:06.548
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

01:11:10.221 --> 01:11:11.921
TALIESIN: This thing's fucking scary, man.

01:11:14.001 --> 01:11:17.172
MATT: That suude fucked up its action economy pretty bad.

01:11:17.172 --> 01:11:18.661
MARISHA: It better. That was good drugs.

01:11:18.661 --> 01:11:19.721
TRAVIS: Don't do drugs, kids.

01:11:19.721 --> 01:11:20.830
MARISHA: Don't do drugs.

01:11:20.830 --> 01:11:22.404
TRAVIS: Just carry them on you at all times

01:11:22.404 --> 01:11:24.311
in lethal dosages.
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

01:11:24.311 --> 01:11:25.921
LAURA: 33 points

01:11:25.921 --> 01:11:28.471
of Guiding Bolt radiant damage.

01:11:28.471 --> 01:11:31.088
LIAM: If you're a giant baby, [Inaudible].

01:11:31.088 --> 01:11:33.141
LAURA: Oh wait, I also get a d4 to the--

01:11:33.141 --> 01:11:34.971
nope. Just kidding.

01:11:34.971 --> 01:11:36.911
MATT: Yeah. The next attack that
would already have advantage

01:11:36.911 --> 01:11:40.771
likely gets advantage already.

01:11:40.771 --> 01:11:41.604
So much advantage.

01:11:41.604 --> 01:11:43.000
We're just stacking advantages.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.391
You can fit so many advantages in this baby.

01:11:44.391 --> 01:11:48.506
LAURA: And I'm going to use my
movement to back away from it.

01:11:49.601 --> 01:11:50.621
MATT: Okay.

01:11:50.621 --> 01:11:51.629
You can do that.

01:11:51.629 --> 01:11:54.801
LAURA: Yeah, 'cause my duplicate's still up there, so...

01:11:54.801 --> 01:11:55.731
MATT: Six, like around there?

01:11:55.731 --> 01:11:56.801
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

01:11:56.801 --> 01:11:58.121
You got it.

01:11:58.121 --> 01:11:59.221
That finishes your go.

01:12:00.211 --> 01:12:03.081
Now, can-- actually, at the end
of its turn, it's going to use

01:12:03.081 --> 01:12:07.929
its last legendary action to also attempt to grapple Yasha.

01:12:07.929 --> 01:12:09.223
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:12:09.223 --> 01:12:12.491
MATT: So I need you to go ahead and make a strength--

01:12:12.491 --> 01:12:15.541
this has to be an athletics or a acrobatics check.

01:12:15.541 --> 01:12:16.374
Your choice.

01:12:16.374 --> 01:12:19.131
MARISHA: And these aren't considered attacks.

01:12:19.131 --> 01:12:19.964
MATT: They are considered--

01:12:19.964 --> 01:12:22.109
it is a grapple action.

01:12:23.211 --> 01:12:24.741
LAURA: Advantage? With advantage?

01:12:24.741 --> 01:12:25.781
MATT: Advantage, 'cause you are raging.

01:12:25.781 --> 01:12:26.935
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:12:28.101 --> 01:12:28.934
Ooh.

01:12:28.934 --> 01:12:29.824
Okay. Okay.

01:12:29.824 --> 01:12:33.861
Okay. That would be a 23.

01:12:35.351 --> 01:12:36.184
MATT: 23.

01:12:36.184 --> 01:12:37.533
Or actually, no, sorry. That's to escape it.

01:12:37.533 --> 01:12:38.831
This is just a strength saving throw.

01:12:38.831 --> 01:12:41.282
So what would-- which you would roll even higher,

01:12:41.282 --> 01:12:42.415
because you have the bonuses for that.

01:12:42.415 --> 01:12:44.121
So you're fine.

01:12:44.121 --> 01:12:45.991
You're fine. No grapple.

01:12:45.991 --> 01:12:47.683
You got it. Now we're back

01:12:47.683 --> 01:12:50.421
at the top of its turn and oh, hey, it's conscious.

01:12:50.421 --> 01:12:52.586
It can get up and do shit again.

01:12:52.586 --> 01:12:54.907
MARISHA: No!
LAURA: Fuck.

01:12:54.907 --> 01:12:56.674
TALIESIN: Bye, half your movement.

01:12:58.751 --> 01:13:00.801
MATT: So, it is...

01:13:01.669 --> 01:13:04.561
(laughter)

01:13:04.561 --> 01:13:06.303
LAURA: It's so big.

01:13:06.303 --> 01:13:08.083
MATT: I need to roll, see if that comes back.

01:13:08.083 --> 01:13:09.525
It does! Okay.

01:13:09.525 --> 01:13:10.491
MARISHA: It's got a tail.

01:13:10.491 --> 01:13:12.562
TRAVIS: What comes back?
LIAM: I want my baby back, baby back.

01:13:12.562 --> 01:13:14.361
TRAVIS: You rolled to see if what comes back?

01:13:14.361 --> 01:13:17.778
SAM: The spray that's going to hit me on the way out?

01:13:18.771 --> 01:13:21.356
MATT: Yeah. (chuckles)

01:13:21.356 --> 01:13:23.151
MATT: So...
ASHLEY: You're prone?

01:13:23.151 --> 01:13:25.301
SAM: I'm on its lips.

01:13:25.301 --> 01:13:27.754
MATT: It's going to attempt to back up.

01:13:29.130 --> 01:13:30.784
SAM: Okay. Take your shots.

01:13:33.051 --> 01:13:33.884
LAURA: Oh yeah.

01:13:33.884 --> 01:13:35.751
TRAVIS: I mean, if it gets out of...

01:13:37.117 --> 01:13:39.920
TALIESIN: It's also-- it's also got-- it can't be that fast

01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:42.305
and it just burned half its movement.

01:13:42.305 --> 01:13:43.721
TRAVIS: Yeah, right.

01:13:43.721 --> 01:13:46.604
TALIESIN: And is Beau prone, or is Beau up?

01:13:48.171 --> 01:13:49.121
MATT: Beau would've been up, actually.

01:13:49.121 --> 01:13:51.138
LAURA: Yeah. She got knocked over when he stood up.

01:13:51.138 --> 01:13:53.621
TALIESIN: So that's a couple of
attacks of opportunity at least.

01:13:53.621 --> 01:13:56.531
MATT: Yeah. It's not a very tactical
creature, unfortunately.

01:13:56.531 --> 01:13:57.364
TALIESIN: That's fine.

01:13:57.364 --> 01:14:01.371
MATT: So both Yasha and Beau get an attack on it.

01:14:01.371 --> 01:14:02.581
See if you can.
TALIESIN: With a d4.

01:14:02.581 --> 01:14:03.414
MARISHA: We do?

01:14:03.414 --> 01:14:04.691
MATT: Yeah, because it's trying to back away from you.

01:14:04.691 --> 01:14:06.131
It feels a little pinned in right now.

01:14:06.131 --> 01:14:07.441
MARISHA: Okay, with advantage, right?

01:14:07.441 --> 01:14:10.271
MATT: Because you still have Yasha's ability.

01:14:10.271 --> 01:14:11.891
MARISHA: Yes, yes, yes, yes.

01:14:11.891 --> 01:14:13.224
It hit for me.

01:14:14.670 --> 01:14:15.931
23.
MATT: 23 hits.

01:14:15.931 --> 01:14:16.844
MARISHA: No, sorry.

01:14:19.386 --> 01:14:24.318
19 plus 10. 29.

01:14:24.318 --> 01:14:26.085
MATT: Yeah, you hit. (laughs)

01:14:26.085 --> 01:14:28.276
You got this. You got this. Yasha, what'd you get?

01:14:28.276 --> 01:14:29.159
ASHLEY: 24.
MATT: 24 hits.

01:14:29.159 --> 01:14:31.597
All right. Damage for both of you and it does not move.

01:14:31.597 --> 01:14:33.264
That pisses it right off.

01:14:35.997 --> 01:14:40.997
MARISHA: All of my shit is weird.
Plus two bonus to attack and damage rolls.

01:14:41.230 --> 01:14:42.063
MATT: All right.

01:14:42.063 --> 01:14:43.818
It's going to go ahead and make a--

01:14:45.623 --> 01:14:47.021
He's going to make a bite attack.

01:14:47.021 --> 01:14:47.946
LAURA: Oh no.

01:14:49.623 --> 01:14:51.571
MATT: After you finished your guys' damage here.

01:14:51.571 --> 01:14:52.801
MARISHA: Oh.

01:14:52.801 --> 01:14:54.269
MATT: You roll for damage for the attacks you guys hit with.

01:14:54.269 --> 01:14:57.081
MARISHA: Right. I rolled terribly.

01:14:57.081 --> 01:14:58.211
It's nine damage.

01:14:58.211 --> 01:14:59.161
MATT: Nine damage.

01:14:59.161 --> 01:15:00.191
Yasha?

01:15:00.191 --> 01:15:02.863
ASHLEY: Wait, I accidentally rolled 3d6

01:15:02.863 --> 01:15:05.441
'cause I added the divine.

01:15:05.441 --> 01:15:06.745
It's only 2d6.

01:15:06.745 --> 01:15:09.571
MATT: Correct, only 2d6.
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:15:09.571 --> 01:15:11.696
Um, okay. That's the same amount.

01:15:12.921 --> 01:15:15.929
Do I add my stuff for the attack of opportunity?

01:15:15.929 --> 01:15:17.216
I don't know why I'm forgetting how to do all

01:15:17.216 --> 01:15:18.340
this right now because I'm nervous.

01:15:18.340 --> 01:15:19.957
LIAM: 12 days of [Inaudible].

01:15:19.957 --> 01:15:21.341
MATT: I think that's on your turn.

01:15:21.341 --> 01:15:23.191
I could be wrong for now.

01:15:23.191 --> 01:15:25.104
We'll just say no. We'll say it just standard attack.

01:15:25.104 --> 01:15:28.241
ASHLEY: 7 points of damage, yeah.

01:15:28.241 --> 01:15:30.601
MATT: With your rage bonus and strength and everything?

01:15:30.601 --> 01:15:31.745
I feel like it should be more than that.

01:15:31.745 --> 01:15:32.828
ASHLEY: It doesn't seem right.

01:15:32.828 --> 01:15:33.751
Sorry.
MATT: That's okay.

01:15:33.751 --> 01:15:35.388
No worries.
ASHLEY: Spacing out.

01:15:37.021 --> 01:15:38.731
MATT: Well, in the interim--

01:15:38.731 --> 01:15:40.781
TALIESIN: This is what you're doing now.

01:15:40.781 --> 01:15:41.614
It's like, that's good

01:15:41.614 --> 01:15:43.181
because that's one of my least favorite photos.

01:15:43.181 --> 01:15:44.885
Well done.
MARISHA: Are you trying to go this way?

01:15:44.885 --> 01:15:47.291
LIAM: It's a pretty good photo of you.
TALIESIN: t's always one that has--

01:15:47.291 --> 01:15:49.051
ASHLEY: Sorry, 11, 11.

01:15:49.051 --> 01:15:50.911
MARISHA: Yellow is a nice color.

01:15:50.911 --> 01:15:52.009
I like that you're color coordinated.

01:15:52.009 --> 01:15:55.044
TALIESIN: No, the yellow is definitely...
LIAM: He's very sunny in it.

01:15:56.371 --> 01:15:57.204
MATT: At its closeness,

01:15:57.204 --> 01:16:00.891
it's now, after having Yasha pull them out

01:16:00.891 --> 01:16:04.401
and being bludgeoned around by the other people--

01:16:04.401 --> 01:16:06.361
and it's a little-- it looks a little bit scared and

01:16:06.361 --> 01:16:09.171
confused. Let's see who it goes after.

01:16:09.171 --> 01:16:11.119
One, two, three. Let me roll.

01:16:13.969 --> 01:16:15.721
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:16:15.721 --> 01:16:16.798
MARISHA: It's coming for me, isn't it?

01:16:16.798 --> 01:16:18.194
MATT: Yeah.
MARISHA: Sentinel, bitch.

01:16:19.031 --> 01:16:20.697
MATT: Well, she already used her reaction.
MARISHA: Oh wait, she can't.

01:16:20.697 --> 01:16:23.191
And then Sentinel on Sentinel doesn't work!

01:16:23.191 --> 01:16:24.044
Okay.
MATT: Yeah.

01:16:25.221 --> 01:16:26.445
MARISHA: All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:16:26.445 --> 01:16:29.612
MATT: Which actually, double check something on that.

01:16:29.612 --> 01:16:31.371
ASHLEY: It's 22 points of damage.

01:16:31.371 --> 01:16:32.311
I'm sorry.

01:16:32.311 --> 01:16:35.237
MARISHA: Am I able to, when he backed up, could I do--

01:16:35.237 --> 01:16:38.191
spend a ki point to get a secondary reaction and get

01:16:38.191 --> 01:16:40.032
another attack?

01:16:40.032 --> 01:16:40.973
SAM: You can do that?

01:16:40.973 --> 01:16:43.841
MARISHA: It's something I rarely get an opportunity to do.

01:16:43.841 --> 01:16:47.591
Yeah. And I tend to save my ki points,

01:16:47.591 --> 01:16:48.566
but this is a time.

01:16:48.566 --> 01:16:49.399
MATT: So, sorry.

01:16:49.399 --> 01:16:50.232
So what were you saying?

01:16:50.232 --> 01:16:54.094
MARISHA: When it backs away, and
I was able to get my reaction.

01:16:55.051 --> 01:16:56.251
LIAM: You two really killed.

01:16:57.231 --> 01:16:59.501
MARISHA: Can I use my Mind of Mercury to spend a ki point

01:16:59.501 --> 01:17:02.511
and get another reaction in this moment of him backing away?

01:17:02.511 --> 01:17:04.351
MATT: You can.
MARISHA: Can I do that?

01:17:04.351 --> 01:17:06.624
I know it's a little past, but.

01:17:06.624 --> 01:17:08.821
MATT: Well, you already tried to hit him backing away

01:17:08.821 --> 01:17:09.941
and kept him in place.

01:17:09.941 --> 01:17:11.911
You do not get the attack on somebody else

01:17:11.911 --> 01:17:14.101
who's being attacked to also has sentinel.

01:17:14.101 --> 01:17:15.781
But this is Mind of Mercury,

01:17:15.781 --> 01:17:17.369
which is I get to spend an extra ki point--
MATT: Oh, that one?

01:17:17.369 --> 01:17:18.845
MARISHA: -- on one extra reaction.

01:17:18.845 --> 01:17:19.678
MATT: Right. And you can go ahead

01:17:19.678 --> 01:17:22.619
and use that extra reaction to?

01:17:22.619 --> 01:17:23.891
MARISHA: Attack.

01:17:23.891 --> 01:17:24.724
Right?

01:17:25.681 --> 01:17:27.733
MATT: Can you? You already did your attack.

01:17:27.733 --> 01:17:29.711
LIAM: Worst product placement ever.

01:17:29.711 --> 01:17:31.953
MARISHA: Just move on and I'll look at the ability.

01:17:31.953 --> 01:17:33.241
I rarely use this ability.

01:17:33.241 --> 01:17:35.104
It's your-- yeah.

01:17:36.666 --> 01:17:39.271
MATT: Regardless, you've got the extra attack,

01:17:39.271 --> 01:17:40.591
for an attack opportunity for trying to move

01:17:40.591 --> 01:17:42.381
out of your melee range and it failed, too,

01:17:42.381 --> 01:17:44.051
because you guys locked it in, correct?

01:17:44.051 --> 01:17:46.226
MARISHA: "Once per turn, if you've
already taken your reaction

01:17:46.226 --> 01:17:49.211
"you may spend one ki point to take an additional reaction."

01:17:49.211 --> 01:17:51.051
MATT: Correct. What's your additional reaction?

01:17:51.051 --> 01:17:52.551
MARISHA: An attack.

01:17:52.551 --> 01:17:53.712
Can I not do that?

01:17:53.712 --> 01:17:56.204
MATT: What's causing the extra attack?

01:17:56.204 --> 01:18:00.301
MARISHA: Him-- me using Mind of Mercury
and him moving out of my range

01:18:00.301 --> 01:18:02.051
TALIESIN: Oh, no, I get it.
MARISHA: -- to get the attack.

01:18:02.051 --> 01:18:02.884
MATT: You already did the attack

01:18:02.884 --> 01:18:04.041
to help him move out of your range.

01:18:04.041 --> 01:18:04.874
You couldn't do that.

01:18:04.874 --> 01:18:06.294
You guys both hit them, did damage,

01:18:06.294 --> 01:18:07.861
and locked him down with Sentinel.

01:18:07.861 --> 01:18:08.694
TALIESIN: It's-- okay.

01:18:08.694 --> 01:18:09.527
MARISHA: But I can't--

01:18:09.527 --> 01:18:10.761
when can I spend my--

01:18:10.761 --> 01:18:13.141
when can I do this with Mind of Mercury, to spend

01:18:13.141 --> 01:18:15.651
to get an extra ki-- like, an extra reaction.

01:18:15.651 --> 01:18:16.484
Is it not now?

01:18:16.484 --> 01:18:18.721
MATT: Anytime, like this.
MARISHA: But I've already done it.

01:18:18.721 --> 01:18:21.181
MATT: But the circumstance here is

01:18:21.181 --> 01:18:24.429
that you only get to attack it again

01:18:24.429 --> 01:18:26.091
if she didn't have Sentinel because you guys--

01:18:26.091 --> 01:18:26.981
your feats cancel each other

01:18:26.981 --> 01:18:28.381
out where you get the extra attack

01:18:28.381 --> 01:18:29.921
against somebody that's not you.

01:18:29.921 --> 01:18:30.754
MARISHA: Okay.

01:18:30.754 --> 01:18:32.231
LIAM: In theory, there could be another enemy

01:18:32.231 --> 01:18:33.921
up against you and--
MATT: Correct.

01:18:33.921 --> 01:18:36.151
LIAM: -- 10 seconds later, you could
have used your reaction to

01:18:36.151 --> 01:18:38.031
hit somebody else moving away from you.

01:18:38.031 --> 01:18:41.154
MATT: Correct. Or if he was attacking Veth instead of,

01:18:42.031 --> 01:18:43.441
you know, you or anybody else

01:18:43.441 --> 01:18:46.061
then you can use your Sentinel feat to then attack them

01:18:46.061 --> 01:18:47.461
with an additional reaction.

01:18:47.461 --> 01:18:48.882
MARISHA: Okay.
MATT: Yeah.

01:18:48.882 --> 01:18:50.638
This is just one of those fiddly circumstances--

01:18:50.638 --> 01:18:51.471
MARISHA: I see.

01:18:51.471 --> 01:18:53.661
MATT: -- where, because it's targeting you,

01:18:53.661 --> 01:18:56.181
you don't get a reaction to attack it back.

01:18:56.181 --> 01:18:57.208
MARISHA: No, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:18:57.208 --> 01:18:58.041
I just didn't know if I could

01:18:58.041 --> 01:19:00.533
double down on that initial one, but no.

01:19:00.533 --> 01:19:03.011
MATT: Yeah, you can't trigger two
reactions from one trigger.

01:19:03.011 --> 01:19:05.301
Yeah. If multiple things trigger,

01:19:05.301 --> 01:19:06.841
you can spend more reactions.

01:19:06.841 --> 01:19:09.834
MARISHA: It's rare that that even comes into play, so.

01:19:09.834 --> 01:19:10.731
LIAM: 7,000 rules.

01:19:10.731 --> 01:19:13.090
MARISHA: Yes. 7,000 rules. Sorry, go ahead.

01:19:13.090 --> 01:19:15.015
MATT: It's all good. So!

01:19:15.015 --> 01:19:16.034
ASHLEY: There's, um,

01:19:16.034 --> 01:19:18.481
an additional four points of damage with mine.

01:19:18.481 --> 01:19:19.973
I'm really sorry.
MATT: All righty.

01:19:19.973 --> 01:19:20.980
TALIESIN: You're good.

01:19:20.980 --> 01:19:21.941
MATT: We'll get there guys.

01:19:21.941 --> 01:19:23.561
We'll get there.

01:19:23.561 --> 01:19:25.491
MARISHA: We'll learn how to play D&amp;D in five years.

01:19:25.491 --> 01:19:26.518
MATT: Nah, it's fine.

01:19:26.518 --> 01:19:28.024
All right, so it's going after you.

01:19:28.024 --> 01:19:29.032
LIAM: Die.

01:19:29.032 --> 01:19:30.161
LAURA: Well, that's what I love that even, like,

01:19:30.161 --> 01:19:32.071
this far into this many campaigns,

01:19:32.071 --> 01:19:34.713
we're still coming up on rules that we've never--
MARISHA: Experienced before.

01:19:34.713 --> 01:19:36.091
LAURA: Yeah. It's cool.
MARISHA: Absolutely.

01:19:36.091 --> 01:19:37.821
MATT: Exactly. So it's a 24 to hit.

01:19:37.821 --> 01:19:39.881
MARISHA: I mean, it comes with a textbook. That hits.

01:19:39.881 --> 01:19:40.724
MATT: Okay.

01:19:40.724 --> 01:19:43.471
(laughter)

01:19:43.471 --> 01:19:44.304
MATT: All righty.

01:19:44.304 --> 01:19:46.545
TRAVIS: It does. An intimidating one at that.

01:19:46.545 --> 01:19:47.472
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:19:49.477 --> 01:19:52.821
MATT: That is going to be 19 points of piercing damage.

01:19:52.821 --> 01:19:53.654
MARISHA: Thank you.

01:19:53.654 --> 01:19:56.183
TALIESIN: You're welcome.
MATT: As it bites down onto you

01:19:57.041 --> 01:19:59.571
and then you also take

01:20:00.611 --> 01:20:02.781
13 points of acid damage.

01:20:02.781 --> 01:20:03.614
TRAVIS: Boy.

01:20:04.723 --> 01:20:07.181
MARISHA: Can fuck off.
MATT: In addition to its bite attack,

01:20:07.181 --> 01:20:09.173
it gets a free grasping arms attack.

01:20:09.173 --> 01:20:11.304
MARISHA: Yeah, sure. Of course, it does.
MATT: So go ahead

01:20:11.304 --> 01:20:13.101
and make a strength saving throw for me.

01:20:13.101 --> 01:20:14.333
TRAVIS: Beau, what'd you say to it?

01:20:14.333 --> 01:20:16.216
TALIESIN: Still have advantage, or?
MARISHA: I don't know.

01:20:16.216 --> 01:20:17.915
MATT: Yeah, you still have advantage.
LAURA: Man, babies hate you, Beau.

01:20:17.915 --> 01:20:21.088
MARISHA: It knows. It knows.

01:20:21.088 --> 01:20:22.912
Strength saving throw?
MATT: Yes.

01:20:22.912 --> 01:20:24.178
You have advantage on it, because of the-

01:20:24.178 --> 01:20:26.011
MARISHA: Oh, thank god.

01:20:26.011 --> 01:20:27.244
Oh, it's worse!

01:20:27.244 --> 01:20:28.757
(laughter)
TALIESIN: And the d4, and the d4!

01:20:28.757 --> 01:20:31.620
MARISHA: Oh no, no, they're the same!

01:20:31.620 --> 01:20:35.135
And a d4? It's not good.

01:20:35.135 --> 01:20:36.407
Okay, okay.

01:20:36.407 --> 01:20:39.851
Eight, nine, 10, 11, 16.

01:20:39.851 --> 01:20:41.492
MATT: 16 does not succeed, unfortunately.

01:20:41.492 --> 01:20:42.558
TRAVIS: Are you going in?

01:20:42.558 --> 01:20:44.101
MATT: No, she's grappled.

01:20:44.101 --> 01:20:46.303
LAURA: You're not going in yet, you're not going in.

01:20:46.303 --> 01:20:48.214
(laughter)

01:20:48.214 --> 01:20:50.546
TALIESIN: Wow, it's glowing.

01:20:50.546 --> 01:20:51.538
LIAM: What?

01:20:51.538 --> 01:20:52.641
TALIESIN: That's amazing.

01:20:52.641 --> 01:20:54.991
ASHLEY: That looks really...
MARISHA: Why am I glowing?

01:20:54.991 --> 01:20:57.091
MATT: It's the grapple.
MARISHA: Oh, it's the light.

01:20:58.061 --> 01:21:00.144
I thought it was something else bad!
MATT: All righty.

01:21:00.144 --> 01:21:01.001
LAURA: Why am I glowing?

01:21:01.001 --> 01:21:03.324
MATT: Now it finishes its turn. Fjord, you're up.

01:21:03.324 --> 01:21:04.361
Veth, you're on deck.

01:21:04.361 --> 01:21:06.661
TRAVIS: I'm going to stay in its melee range

01:21:06.661 --> 01:21:09.341
and move around towards the front of it.

01:21:09.341 --> 01:21:11.230
MATT: Okay. Are you going to--

01:21:11.230 --> 01:21:12.311
TRAVIS: I'm going to try the wisdom.

01:21:12.311 --> 01:21:14.111
MATT: Go for it. Roll for wisdom save, with advantage.

01:21:14.111 --> 01:21:15.155
TRAVIS: With advantage.

01:21:15.155 --> 01:21:16.630
MATT: You get to add a d4 to it.

01:21:16.630 --> 01:21:17.843
LIAM: Fuh-jord.

01:21:17.843 --> 01:21:19.299
TRAVIS: 16.

01:21:19.299 --> 01:21:21.591
16 plus two is 18.

01:21:21.591 --> 01:21:22.424
MATT: 18.
LAURA: With advantage?

01:21:22.424 --> 01:21:24.384
MATT: Yeah, he rolled advantage. Yeah, you're fine.

01:21:24.384 --> 01:21:25.417
TRAVIS: Was that okay?
MATT: Yeah.

01:21:25.417 --> 01:21:26.575
TALIESIN: And a d4.
TRAVIS: Great.

01:21:26.575 --> 01:21:28.531
So I'll move around to its front

01:21:31.004 --> 01:21:32.731
and I will take a shot

01:21:32.731 --> 01:21:36.941
at chopping off tentacle-eye stalk-thing.

01:21:36.941 --> 01:21:38.299
MATT: All right.
TRAVIS: With the Star Razor.

01:21:38.299 --> 01:21:39.209
MATT: Go ahead and roll for an attack.

01:21:39.209 --> 01:21:41.976
It has a much higher AC, but you can attempt to.

01:21:41.976 --> 01:21:44.291
TRAVIS: Okay, and I have advantage on this still?

01:21:44.291 --> 01:21:45.124
TALIESIN: And a d4.

01:21:45.124 --> 01:21:46.041
TRAVIS: And a d4.

01:21:47.181 --> 01:21:49.928
MATT: It's like being attacked by Clippy everywhere.

01:21:49.928 --> 01:21:51.144
It's awesome.
TALIESIN: The one thing I need.

01:21:51.144 --> 01:21:53.277
MATT: It's great.
TALIESIN: What I'm doing.

01:21:53.277 --> 01:21:54.797
Keeps me from doing any other spell.

01:21:54.797 --> 01:21:55.791
MATT: That was awesome.

01:21:55.791 --> 01:21:57.581
TRAVIS: 27 plus two, 29.

01:21:57.581 --> 01:21:59.061
SAM: Wow!
MATT: That will hit.

01:21:59.061 --> 01:21:59.894
Go ahead and roll damage.

01:21:59.894 --> 01:22:02.491
MATT: Okay, 29. First one.
LAURA: Chop it off!

01:22:02.491 --> 01:22:03.658
TRAVIS and LAURA: Chop it off.

01:22:05.451 --> 01:22:06.678
TRAVIS: That is 13.

01:22:06.678 --> 01:22:07.511
13, 16...

01:22:07.511 --> 01:22:09.913
LIAM: (like Clippy) It looks like
you're trying to sever a baby's eyestalk.

01:22:09.913 --> 01:22:11.811
TRAVIS: I'm sorry.

01:22:11.811 --> 01:22:12.644
18 points

01:22:12.644 --> 01:22:14.993
because it's plus five for Hexblade's Curse.
MARISHA: (like Clippy) I have a template for that.

01:22:14.993 --> 01:22:16.863
TRAVIS: 18 points of--

01:22:16.863 --> 01:22:18.121
MATT: Slashing damage.
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:22:18.121 --> 01:22:22.008
MATT: So as you swing with the first arc of the blade

01:22:22.008 --> 01:22:26.131
you watch as it severs mostly, but it's still holding on.

01:22:26.131 --> 01:22:29.050
The light's starting to dull a little bit,

01:22:29.050 --> 01:22:30.221
flicker.

01:22:30.221 --> 01:22:31.611
It's-- You're pretty close,

01:22:31.611 --> 01:22:33.061
but it's not quite enough to fully sever it.

01:22:33.061 --> 01:22:34.521
TRAVIS: One more, one more swipe.

01:22:34.521 --> 01:22:37.470
MATT: All right. You got advantage.
MARISHA: C'mon, Fjord.

01:22:37.470 --> 01:22:41.291
TRAVIS: That'll hit, but I'll roll another one just to see.

01:22:41.291 --> 01:22:42.441
Oh, that's even higher.

01:22:44.631 --> 01:22:45.464
Yeah.

01:22:46.531 --> 01:22:48.481
It's 33 to hit.

01:22:48.481 --> 01:22:49.814
MATT: That hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

01:22:49.814 --> 01:22:50.662
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:22:50.662 --> 01:22:52.554
MATT: It was a 25 AC to try and hit that thing.

01:22:52.554 --> 01:22:53.387
LAURA and ASHLEY: Wow.

01:22:55.801 --> 01:22:58.353
TRAVIS: No. Yeah. Eight plus...

01:22:58.353 --> 01:23:00.631
21. 21 points.

01:23:00.631 --> 01:23:01.931
MATT: Pulling back the second swipe.

01:23:01.931 --> 01:23:04.565
You leap a little up into the air and

01:23:04.565 --> 01:23:06.711
as you bring the blade down, you're not even sure

01:23:06.711 --> 01:23:08.921
if you hit, you just hit the ground there.

01:23:08.921 --> 01:23:10.341
And the light adjustment changes in the room

01:23:10.341 --> 01:23:12.061
as the shadows stretch and go long

01:23:12.061 --> 01:23:14.341
as you watch it hit the ground and the light

01:23:15.261 --> 01:23:18.032
fades out of the bulb on the ground.
(cheering)

01:23:18.032 --> 01:23:19.220
LIAM: My man.

01:23:19.220 --> 01:23:20.263
ASHLEY: Yes.

01:23:20.263 --> 01:23:21.096
TRAVIS: Amazing.

01:23:21.096 --> 01:23:23.171
MATT: So that is no longer a worry for you.

01:23:23.171 --> 01:23:25.162
LAURA: Cool. Which is good because Yasha is about to--

01:23:25.162 --> 01:23:26.491
we're about to lose that advantage.

01:23:26.491 --> 01:23:27.527
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:23:27.527 --> 01:23:29.277
MATT: So that finish your turn, Fjord?

01:23:30.571 --> 01:23:32.411
TRAVIS: Relentless Hex.

01:23:32.411 --> 01:23:34.821
That's only once a day?

01:23:34.821 --> 01:23:36.901
I don't see-- Bonus action.

01:23:36.901 --> 01:23:38.531
Five feet cursed.

01:23:38.531 --> 01:23:42.606
It doesn't say any, like-- could I do it again?

01:23:44.037 --> 01:23:45.216
MATT: Should be limitations on it.

01:23:45.216 --> 01:23:46.591
TRAVIS: Yeah, there should be, right.

01:23:46.591 --> 01:23:47.691
MATT: Let me double check.

01:23:53.562 --> 01:23:55.146
TALIESIN: This has been a nerve wracking fight.

01:23:55.146 --> 01:23:55.979
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:23:55.979 --> 01:23:57.641
MATT: Pull it up here.

01:23:57.641 --> 01:23:58.931
TRAVIS: I don't see a limitation.

01:23:58.931 --> 01:24:01.730
It seems like only something you could do once.

01:24:01.730 --> 01:24:02.955
MATT: No. It lasts as long as you--

01:24:02.955 --> 01:24:03.861
I think as a bonus action,

01:24:03.861 --> 01:24:05.117
you can just teleport back to the target.

01:24:05.117 --> 01:24:08.278
TRAVIS: Okay, yes, I'm going to teleport back to its anus.

01:24:08.278 --> 01:24:10.146
(laughter)

01:24:10.146 --> 01:24:12.605
MATT: Ah-noos.
TRAVIS: (explosion sounds)

01:24:13.561 --> 01:24:15.452
MATT: There you go.
TRAVIS: That's my turn.

01:24:15.452 --> 01:24:16.694
MATT: All right. End of your turn,

01:24:16.694 --> 01:24:18.641
it's going to use two legendary actions.

01:24:18.641 --> 01:24:19.985
LAURA: Two?!
MATT: Yep.

01:24:19.985 --> 01:24:20.818
LAURA: Two?!

01:24:20.818 --> 01:24:23.459
MATT: To attempt to swallow you, Veth.

01:24:23.459 --> 01:24:24.529
LAURA: No!

01:24:24.529 --> 01:24:25.911
MARISHA: Wait, are we both grappled?

01:24:25.911 --> 01:24:26.881
He's got both of us in his baby arms?

01:24:26.881 --> 01:24:28.320
MATT: Yeah, you're both grappled.

01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:30.153
MARISHA: Oh no.

01:24:30.153 --> 01:24:32.421
TRAVIS: I would've tried to pull you out, but I'm Fjord.

01:24:32.421 --> 01:24:33.480
MATT: That's a natural 20.

01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:34.313
LAURA: No!

01:24:34.313 --> 01:24:36.476
TALIESIN: Canceled.

01:24:36.476 --> 01:24:37.773
TRAVIS: Can you cancel?
MATT: Yeah, you can, because you see it.

01:24:37.773 --> 01:24:38.606
TALIESIN: Canceled.

01:24:38.606 --> 01:24:40.641
MATT: Aw. I never get to have any fun.

01:24:40.641 --> 01:24:44.591
(laughter)

01:24:44.591 --> 01:24:46.621
TRAVIS: Grave clerics, man.

01:24:46.621 --> 01:24:48.821
MATT: Ah. Next campaign: no grave clerics.

01:24:48.821 --> 01:24:50.341
(laughter)

01:24:50.341 --> 01:24:51.468
No, it's totally fine.
TALIESIN: Fair. Fair.

01:24:51.468 --> 01:24:52.401
MATT: It's totally fine.

01:24:54.281 --> 01:24:55.514
Well, good. So it's not a crit on you.

01:24:55.514 --> 01:24:56.347
SAM: Great.

01:24:57.851 --> 01:25:00.655
MATT: I can't wait to make NPCs
that can cancel crits on you guys.

01:25:00.655 --> 01:25:02.391
I haven't done that yet.

01:25:02.391 --> 01:25:03.224
All right.

01:25:03.224 --> 01:25:04.312
So now,

01:25:05.571 --> 01:25:06.624
you take,

01:25:09.791 --> 01:25:11.624
18-- No, sorry. Plus six would be

01:25:11.624 --> 01:25:13.581
24 points of piercing damage.

01:25:13.581 --> 01:25:16.936
SAM: Can I Uncanny Dodge this?

01:25:18.491 --> 01:25:19.351
MATT: I mean, you're grappled.

01:25:19.351 --> 01:25:21.021
I think you can, yeah, still.

01:25:21.021 --> 01:25:23.491
SAM: Okay. I'll Uncanny Dodge that.

01:25:23.491 --> 01:25:25.161
MATT: All right so you take half that.

01:25:25.161 --> 01:25:25.994
SAM: Okay.

01:25:26.981 --> 01:25:27.930
MATT: Plus...

01:25:30.619 --> 01:25:33.351
That would be 20 points of acid damage.

01:25:33.351 --> 01:25:34.691
SAM: Sure, sure, sure.

01:25:34.691 --> 01:25:38.551
MATT: Which is also halved, technically,
because that's all part of the same attack.

01:25:38.551 --> 01:25:40.433
SAM: Oh, okay. Great.

01:25:41.417 --> 01:25:42.341
TRAVIS: Great.
MATT: However,

01:25:42.341 --> 01:25:47.136
because you were swallowed, you also take an additional--

01:25:47.136 --> 01:25:48.662
Okay, that's rough.

01:25:49.664 --> 01:25:50.880
TRAVIS: Uh-oh.
LIAM: It still has two legendary--

01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:52.581
LAURA: You're still swallowed, you're definitely swallowed?

01:25:52.581 --> 01:25:54.451
LIAM: Yeah, he just made it not a crit.

01:25:54.451 --> 01:25:55.921
MATT: 25 points of acid damage.

01:25:55.921 --> 01:25:56.754
SAM: Sure, sure, sure.

01:25:56.754 --> 01:25:58.351
MATT: And you are now swallowed by the creature.

01:25:58.351 --> 01:26:00.551
LIAM: And it still has two resistances left. Doesn't it?

01:26:00.551 --> 01:26:01.384
LAURA: Yes.
MATT: Yep.

01:26:02.952 --> 01:26:05.481
LAURA: I know, that's why I haven't
done certain spells on it.

01:26:05.481 --> 01:26:06.951
LIAM: Yeah. Yeah.

01:26:06.951 --> 01:26:10.531
But until we do that, it's got them.
LAURA: It's not going to lose them.

01:26:10.531 --> 01:26:11.364
MATT: You are restrained.

01:26:11.364 --> 01:26:13.511
You guys watch as the creature now, hurt,

01:26:13.511 --> 01:26:15.321
it lost the lure on the front of its head.

01:26:15.321 --> 01:26:17.667
It's looking panicked, the arms just stuff

01:26:17.667 --> 01:26:19.986
Veth into its mouth as it closes its jaw

01:26:19.986 --> 01:26:22.066
and you're on the outside of it,

01:26:22.066 --> 01:26:23.641
(roaring), opens up.

01:26:23.641 --> 01:26:24.474
She's gone.

01:26:24.474 --> 01:26:25.307
MARISHA: (groaning)

01:26:25.307 --> 01:26:26.990
SAM: I still love babies, though!

01:26:26.990 --> 01:26:29.112
(laughter)
MARISHA: (groaning)

01:26:29.112 --> 01:26:30.161
MATT: Veth, it's your turn.

01:26:30.161 --> 01:26:31.891
SAM: Oh, it's my turn.
MATT: At top of your turn,

01:26:31.891 --> 01:26:35.401
you begin to take digestive acid damage.

01:26:35.401 --> 01:26:37.381
LIAM: No, no, no, no.
LAURA: God.

01:26:37.381 --> 01:26:38.821
MARISHA: Where are you?

01:26:38.821 --> 01:26:41.461
LAURA: Yeah, where, where are you?
SAM: I'm fine.

01:26:41.461 --> 01:26:43.756
TALIESIN: That's Sam for, "I'm fudged."
LAURA: Yeah, "I'm going to die."

01:26:43.756 --> 01:26:46.028
LIAM: He's about to die.

01:26:46.028 --> 01:26:48.681
(sighs)

01:26:48.681 --> 01:26:49.751
MARISHA: Yeah. He's got that tension.

01:26:49.751 --> 01:26:52.381
He's saying he's fine, but it's not on his face.

01:26:52.381 --> 01:26:53.954
MATT: 25 points of acid damage.

01:26:53.954 --> 01:26:55.841
SAM: Fine, fine. Totally fine.

01:26:55.841 --> 01:26:56.921
MATT: All right. So what are you doing?

01:26:56.921 --> 01:26:58.460
SAM: Miles to go.

01:26:58.460 --> 01:26:59.764
TRAVIS: "Miles to go."

01:27:01.021 --> 01:27:02.644
SAM: I got to get out of here, right?

01:27:04.430 --> 01:27:05.851
TALIESIN: That would be helpful.

01:27:05.851 --> 01:27:08.711
SAM: I've got to somehow.
LAURA: You got any suude on you?

01:27:08.711 --> 01:27:09.751
MARISHA: Don't waste it.

01:27:09.751 --> 01:27:10.985
It's better elsewhere.
TRAVIS: What did Pinocchio do?

01:27:10.985 --> 01:27:12.201
TALIESIN: We're all going to need it when this is done.

01:27:12.201 --> 01:27:13.202
MARISHA: Exactly.

01:27:13.202 --> 01:27:14.561
(laughter)

01:27:14.561 --> 01:27:16.999
SAM: What are all of these empty vials in here?

01:27:16.999 --> 01:27:18.638
(laughter)

01:27:18.638 --> 01:27:21.351
MARISHA: Scoop it up, scoop it up!

01:27:21.351 --> 01:27:22.869
TRAVIS: Go out with a bang.

01:27:22.869 --> 01:27:24.881
(laughter)

01:27:24.881 --> 01:27:26.931
SAM: All right. Looking through my equipment.

01:27:26.931 --> 01:27:28.799
I got a flask.

01:27:28.799 --> 01:27:30.402
(laughs)

01:27:30.402 --> 01:27:31.504
I got...

01:27:31.504 --> 01:27:32.581
TRAVIS: (like Veth) Flutternutter!

01:27:32.581 --> 01:27:34.490
SAM: I do have Fluffernutter.

01:27:34.490 --> 01:27:36.909
Don't think I'm not thinking about that.

01:27:36.909 --> 01:27:38.811
MARISHA: Do you have some fireworks that I've given you?

01:27:38.811 --> 01:27:39.845
Do you have any extra fireworks?

01:27:39.845 --> 01:27:41.703
TRAVIS: A hydra inside--

01:27:42.836 --> 01:27:45.821
SAM: Could I just try to force my way out?

01:27:45.821 --> 01:27:46.874
Just curious.

01:27:48.201 --> 01:27:52.211
MATT: No, you either have to do
enough damage to be regurgitated

01:27:52.211 --> 01:27:57.051
or somebody else has to try and help you out, as seen.

01:27:57.051 --> 01:27:58.371
SAM: Got it.

01:27:58.371 --> 01:28:02.321
MATT: Or do enough damage to
the inside in some way to upset.

01:28:02.321 --> 01:28:03.351
TALIESIN: You could sneak attack it.

01:28:03.351 --> 01:28:05.097
LIAM: Sneak attack on its...?

01:28:05.097 --> 01:28:07.381
MATT: If you could give yourself
advantage on the attack roll,

01:28:07.381 --> 01:28:08.214
then yeah.

01:28:08.214 --> 01:28:11.555
SAM: I'm sure I don't get-- I can't shoot a thing.

01:28:11.555 --> 01:28:14.061
LAURA: You still have advantage
because it isn't Yasha's turn yet.

01:28:14.061 --> 01:28:14.894
LIAM: It's occupied with...

01:28:14.894 --> 01:28:16.681
MATT: It is, but you're restrained,
which means you're disadvantage.

01:28:16.681 --> 01:28:18.051
So it should just become a regular attack.

01:28:18.051 --> 01:28:20.021
LIAM: Oh, so there is no way to get advantage

01:28:20.021 --> 01:28:21.261
because of the restraint.

01:28:21.261 --> 01:28:22.311
MATT: Technically right now, yeah.

01:28:22.311 --> 01:28:24.189
LIAM: Oh.

01:28:24.189 --> 01:28:25.725
SAM: Unless I hide.

01:28:25.725 --> 01:28:30.371
(laughter)

01:28:30.371 --> 01:28:31.251
ASHLEY: You can't see me!

01:28:31.251 --> 01:28:33.661
SAM: Wait, but if-- restrained.

01:28:33.661 --> 01:28:36.851
So there's no way, even though it's engaged with my allies

01:28:36.851 --> 01:28:37.684
and stuff...

01:28:37.684 --> 01:28:38.517
LIAM: The restraint is canceling.

01:28:38.517 --> 01:28:40.771
SAM: The restraint cancels all that shit.

01:28:40.771 --> 01:28:43.201
MATT: I would say, technically,

01:28:43.201 --> 01:28:46.061
you are not using your friends to your advantage

01:28:46.061 --> 01:28:49.411
to angle for a rough spot because you're inside of its body.

01:28:49.411 --> 01:28:50.641
SAM: Yeah.
LIAM: Fuck.

01:28:50.641 --> 01:28:52.104
SAM: This makes total sense.

01:28:53.791 --> 01:28:55.741
I'm still looking through my equipment and not

01:28:55.741 --> 01:28:57.131
really finding anything.

01:28:57.131 --> 01:28:58.797
I have-- I wrote down

01:28:58.797 --> 01:29:03.543
rotten drug fruit from, like, months ago.

01:29:03.543 --> 01:29:05.501
LAURA: Oh yeah. We got drug fruit. We had acid fruit.

01:29:05.501 --> 01:29:06.441
I got one of those, too.

01:29:06.441 --> 01:29:08.935
SAM: Yeah, but that's like, months old.

01:29:08.935 --> 01:29:10.968
LAURA: It doesn't matter.
MARISHA: That means it's more potent.

01:29:12.642 --> 01:29:15.033
MATT: That shit is gross.

01:29:15.033 --> 01:29:16.661
One of your pouches has, like, that

01:29:16.661 --> 01:29:17.994
dark soggy bottom to it.

01:29:17.994 --> 01:29:19.129
(groaning)

01:29:19.129 --> 01:29:21.131
That you just kind of don't mention.

01:29:21.131 --> 01:29:24.761
LIAM: Yeah. That fruit now has fungus
growing on it, so it's two drugs.

01:29:24.761 --> 01:29:25.594
MARISHA: Yeah!

01:29:25.594 --> 01:29:27.309
TRAVIS: That's definitely got some damage to it.
MATT: What are you doing, Veth?

01:29:27.309 --> 01:29:28.434
What are you doing?
ASHLEY: Kill him.

01:29:28.434 --> 01:29:29.984
SAM: Man. I got nothing.

01:29:31.054 --> 01:29:32.838
TRAVIS: (as Veth) Fluffernutter.

01:29:32.838 --> 01:29:34.741
(laughter)

01:29:34.741 --> 01:29:35.651
LAURA: Yeah, do it.

01:29:35.651 --> 01:29:37.518
SAM: I can just stab him.

01:29:37.518 --> 01:29:39.611
MATT: If the panic takes hold for too long,

01:29:39.611 --> 01:29:40.811
I'm going to have to move on to Yasha.

01:29:40.811 --> 01:29:41.644
SAM: I feel you.

01:29:43.091 --> 01:29:46.451
If I Fluffernutter, I'm going to blow myself up. Right?

01:29:46.451 --> 01:29:48.911
So I'm going to take out that Corecut Dagger

01:29:48.911 --> 01:29:50.681
and just swipe.

01:29:50.681 --> 01:29:52.384
MATT: Go for it. So make an attack.

01:29:52.384 --> 01:29:53.959
It would be with advantage and the disadvantage.

01:29:53.959 --> 01:29:54.915
So it's just a straight attack roll.

01:29:54.915 --> 01:29:56.267
TALIESIN: With d4.
MATT: Correct.

01:29:56.267 --> 01:29:58.174
SAM: With a d4.

01:29:58.174 --> 01:30:00.586
Might help. Doesn't really help.

01:30:03.326 --> 01:30:05.111
LAURA: By the time it got to him--

01:30:05.111 --> 01:30:06.739
SAM: 18.
MATT: 18.

01:30:06.739 --> 01:30:08.998
Unfortunately, as you try and carve and cut through,

01:30:08.998 --> 01:30:11.901
the stomach lining of this beast is almost as strong

01:30:11.901 --> 01:30:14.451
as the exterior of its hide.

01:30:14.451 --> 01:30:16.611
And as you try and cut and carve through,

01:30:16.611 --> 01:30:19.611
it seems to slide and not make much

01:30:19.611 --> 01:30:21.034
of an impact on the interior.

01:30:21.034 --> 01:30:22.109
SAM: Makes sense, makes sense.

01:30:22.109 --> 01:30:24.191
MATT: Unfortunately, it does not work.

01:30:24.191 --> 01:30:25.571
SAM: If I had done the thing,

01:30:25.571 --> 01:30:27.374
I could take a second attack, but I can't.

01:30:27.374 --> 01:30:29.481
MATT: Not with the dagger, you can't.

01:30:29.481 --> 01:30:31.241
SAM: So, and that's it.

01:30:31.241 --> 01:30:32.221
MATT: That's your turn.
SAM: I think so.

01:30:32.221 --> 01:30:35.771
I can't take a potion as a bonus, right?

01:30:35.771 --> 01:30:38.054
MATT: I will say of this, you could,

01:30:38.054 --> 01:30:41.141
because all you did was swipe with your dagger once. Sure.

01:30:41.141 --> 01:30:42.475
SAM: Think I'll take this potion.

01:30:42.475 --> 01:30:44.660
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:30:44.660 --> 01:30:46.261
MARISHA: I thought you were fine.

01:30:46.261 --> 01:30:48.191
SAM: I will-- I am right now,

01:30:48.191 --> 01:30:51.101
but in the next turn, probably not.

01:30:51.101 --> 01:30:54.338
TALIESIN: That's not how any of that works.

01:30:54.338 --> 01:30:55.779
SAM: 10 points of healing.

01:30:55.779 --> 01:30:56.870
TRAVIS: Hey!
MATT: Great.

01:30:56.870 --> 01:30:58.053
LIAM: God.
SAM: Now I'm okay.

01:30:58.053 --> 01:31:01.324
MATT: Yep. And don't forget you also mark off your... yeah.

01:31:01.324 --> 01:31:02.319
SAM: Oh shit.
MATT: Yeah.

01:31:02.319 --> 01:31:03.499
LIAM: Fuck.

01:31:03.499 --> 01:31:05.698
MATT: All right. So that finishes your go.

01:31:05.698 --> 01:31:06.564
At the end of your turn,

01:31:06.564 --> 01:31:10.851
it's going to use its last legendary action

01:31:10.851 --> 01:31:12.891
to attempt to

01:31:12.891 --> 01:31:14.503
spin, now that it has free arms.

01:31:14.503 --> 01:31:15.401
LIAM: Oh, it's dancing.

01:31:15.401 --> 01:31:18.061
MATT: The arms are now going to
reach back towards you, Yasha.

01:31:18.061 --> 01:31:18.894
ASHLEY: Okay.
MATT: Go ahead and make a strength

01:31:18.894 --> 01:31:20.668
saving throw for me.

01:31:20.668 --> 01:31:22.564
LIAM: Come on, you beast!
MATT: With advantage.

01:31:22.564 --> 01:31:24.351
TRAVIS: It's just reaching for the ladies.

01:31:24.351 --> 01:31:26.291
Like, it's just looking for a mom.

01:31:26.291 --> 01:31:27.124
ASHLEY: It is.

01:31:27.124 --> 01:31:28.411
Okay, so.

01:31:28.411 --> 01:31:30.851
MATT: It's running on instinct.

01:31:30.851 --> 01:31:32.906
TRAVIS: Aw, that's--
LAURA: No!

01:31:32.906 --> 01:31:34.431
ASHLEY: Still the d4?
TALIESIN: Still the d4.

01:31:34.431 --> 01:31:35.731
TRAVIS: It's looking for a mom?

01:31:35.731 --> 01:31:36.564
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:31:37.601 --> 01:31:38.681
LIAM: Are you my mother?

01:31:38.681 --> 01:31:40.321
ASHLEY: 27.
MATT: 27. You're fine.

01:31:40.321 --> 01:31:42.081
You manage to just dodge out of the way.

01:31:42.081 --> 01:31:43.701
Now it's the top of your turn, Yasha.

01:31:43.701 --> 01:31:45.951
The bulb at the front of his head has been cut off.

01:31:45.951 --> 01:31:47.051
You don't have to worry about it.

01:31:47.051 --> 01:31:48.901
It's all you.

01:31:48.901 --> 01:31:50.601
You see Beauregard currently wrestling

01:31:50.601 --> 01:31:52.599
with the arms on one side of his mouth. Veth is vanished.

01:31:52.599 --> 01:31:54.171
The rest of your friends are beginning to gather around.

01:31:54.171 --> 01:31:55.121
What are you doing?

01:31:56.357 --> 01:31:57.261
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:31:57.261 --> 01:32:00.041
I don't think I can pull you out because the baby's not--

01:32:00.041 --> 01:32:01.718
SAM: Don't worry about me, I'm fine.

01:32:03.408 --> 01:32:05.649
ASHLEY: Okay. So I'm going to take an attack at the--

01:32:05.649 --> 01:32:08.999
I'm just going to start swinging around his neck area,

01:32:08.999 --> 01:32:11.554
trying to stay away from the tummy.

01:32:11.554 --> 01:32:12.661
MATT: You got it. Go for it.

01:32:12.661 --> 01:32:15.783
ASHLEY: Okay, um. (nervous noises)

01:32:17.681 --> 01:32:18.514
Okay.

01:32:20.611 --> 01:32:23.481
That would be-- Oh wait, I didn't get to roll again.

01:32:23.481 --> 01:32:24.718
So that's--
TALIESIN: With the d4.

01:32:24.718 --> 01:32:25.821
ASHLEY: With the d4.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:32:25.821 --> 01:32:29.351
I will keep saying that until everyone murders me.

01:32:29.351 --> 01:32:30.591
ASHLEY: Yeah!

01:32:30.591 --> 01:32:33.758
Okay. So 18--

01:32:35.641 --> 01:32:36.474
Okay.

01:32:38.081 --> 01:32:39.541
29 points.

01:32:39.541 --> 01:32:41.211
29 for--
MATT: 29 does hit.

01:32:41.211 --> 01:32:42.731
Yep. So go ahead and roll damage on that,

01:32:42.731 --> 01:32:44.541
prepping for your second attack.

01:32:44.541 --> 01:32:45.531
Beau, you're on deck.

01:32:45.531 --> 01:32:47.339
MARISHA: Oh lord.

01:32:47.339 --> 01:32:48.911
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:32:48.911 --> 01:32:50.126
LAURA: And you're grappled?

01:32:50.126 --> 01:32:51.625
TALIESIN: You can still attack when grappled.
LAURA: In its arms?

01:32:51.625 --> 01:32:53.271
MARISHA: I can still attack, though.

01:32:53.271 --> 01:32:54.259
I just can't go anywhere.

01:32:54.259 --> 01:32:55.734
TRAVIS: He's not, like, healing?

01:32:55.734 --> 01:32:56.881
MATT: No, he's looking rough.

01:32:56.881 --> 01:32:59.546
ASHLEY: 28 for the first hit.

01:32:59.546 --> 01:33:00.639
MATT: 28, nice.

01:33:03.391 --> 01:33:05.141
ASHLEY: And I'm going to roll again

01:33:07.059 --> 01:33:08.554
to hit again.

01:33:10.491 --> 01:33:14.991
TALIESIN: If it-- again, that's only if consciousness drops.

01:33:14.991 --> 01:33:16.491
LAURA: I've been collecting them.

01:33:17.651 --> 01:33:19.632
ASHLEY: 25.
MATT: 25 hits.

01:33:19.632 --> 01:33:21.966
Go ahead and roll damage.
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:33:23.631 --> 01:33:25.931
Let me do Savage Attacker.

01:33:25.931 --> 01:33:26.864
It's the same.

01:33:29.077 --> 01:33:32.660
♪ (frustrated notes) ♪

01:33:33.535 --> 01:33:35.026
17 points of damage.

01:33:35.026 --> 01:33:36.881
MATT: 17 points of damage.

01:33:36.881 --> 01:33:38.271
Ooh, he's looking real, real rough.

01:33:38.271 --> 01:33:39.698
TRAVIS: Oh, real, real rough. Real, real rough!

01:33:39.698 --> 01:33:40.993
(alarm wailing)

01:33:40.993 --> 01:33:43.243
(laughter)

01:33:44.981 --> 01:33:46.371
MARISHA: It's the real, real rough alarm.

01:33:46.371 --> 01:33:47.891
MATT: Now without the distractions around you

01:33:47.891 --> 01:33:49.411
just rage instilled in your body,

01:33:49.411 --> 01:33:52.041
you just begin hacking at the side of its shoulder and neck.

01:33:52.041 --> 01:33:53.731
And as you do, you carve huge slivers

01:33:53.731 --> 01:33:55.381
of its flesh out that hit the ground,

01:33:55.381 --> 01:33:59.291
exposing muscle beneath, an odd old meat

01:33:59.291 --> 01:34:03.801
grayish tint to it as it sloughs off onto the ground.

01:34:03.801 --> 01:34:05.341
You're feeling good.

01:34:05.341 --> 01:34:06.181
ASHLEY: Okay.
MATT: All right.

01:34:06.181 --> 01:34:07.899
That finishes Yasha's turn, unless you want to move.

01:34:07.899 --> 01:34:09.328
TRAVIS: Take a bite.

01:34:09.328 --> 01:34:10.591
MATT: Just go in.

01:34:10.591 --> 01:34:12.851
If you're not moving, then Beauregard, it's your go.

01:34:12.851 --> 01:34:14.361
ASHLEY: I'll stay.

01:34:14.361 --> 01:34:15.591
LIAM: Punch the shit out of it.

01:34:15.591 --> 01:34:16.870
MARISHA: I'm going to punch the shit out of it.

01:34:16.870 --> 01:34:20.001
I'm in its face, and I'm just going to,

01:34:20.001 --> 01:34:22.121
you know Brody in Jaws

01:34:22.121 --> 01:34:23.841
with the spear,

01:34:23.841 --> 01:34:26.193
just like as he's got me

01:34:27.551 --> 01:34:28.511
in his clasps.

01:34:28.511 --> 01:34:30.348
Wait, do I still have advantage on these?

01:34:30.348 --> 01:34:31.531
MATT: No.
ASHLEY: No.

01:34:31.531 --> 01:34:32.589
MARISHA: First hit.

01:34:32.589 --> 01:34:34.831
Ooh, 24,

01:34:34.831 --> 01:34:36.341
Second hit.

01:34:36.341 --> 01:34:37.931
Not great.

01:34:37.931 --> 01:34:41.081
13, but I have a d4.

01:34:41.081 --> 01:34:41.941
LAURA: Oh right.

01:34:41.941 --> 01:34:42.774
MARISHA: 15 total.

01:34:42.774 --> 01:34:45.068
MATT: Only the first hit hits.
MARISHA: First hit. All right.

01:34:45.068 --> 01:34:47.003
SAM: Only the first tit.

01:34:47.003 --> 01:34:48.799
(chuckling)

01:34:48.799 --> 01:34:50.031
TALIESIN: The question is, do I do damage

01:34:50.031 --> 01:34:51.781
or do I do emergency?

01:34:51.781 --> 01:34:52.872
MARISHA: 11 damage?
TRAVIS: On him?

01:34:52.872 --> 01:34:54.427
MATT: 11 damage, all righty.
TRAVIS: Her.

01:34:54.427 --> 01:34:55.260
TALIESIN: Be okay.

01:34:56.801 --> 01:34:57.821
MARISHA: Pop pop.

01:34:57.821 --> 01:34:59.053
MATT: All right. Flurry of Blows. Go in.

01:34:59.053 --> 01:35:02.468
MARISHA: I'm just, yeah, like.

01:35:02.468 --> 01:35:04.581
Try to slide my staff in my belt.

01:35:04.581 --> 01:35:07.661
And at this point, I'm just furious

01:35:07.661 --> 01:35:10.619
and I'm going full on claws to the eyes.

01:35:10.619 --> 01:35:11.691
MATT: Go for it.

01:35:11.691 --> 01:35:15.116
MARISHA: Just trying to gouge out his stupid baby eyes.

01:35:15.116 --> 01:35:17.681
MATT: There is one eye within reach.

01:35:17.681 --> 01:35:19.901
MARISHA: There's one eye within reach, 18.

01:35:19.901 --> 01:35:21.601
MATT: 18 does not hit.
TALIESIN: With the d4?

01:35:22.701 --> 01:35:25.106
MARISHA: Nope.

01:35:25.106 --> 01:35:26.441
22. I rolled a four.

01:35:26.441 --> 01:35:28.522
MATT: That hits.
MARISHA: That hits

01:35:28.522 --> 01:35:33.207
and then this is 12, 22 plus a d4,

01:35:33.207 --> 01:35:34.337
23 total.

01:35:34.337 --> 01:35:36.341
ASHLEY: Yes.

01:35:36.341 --> 01:35:37.949
TALIESIN: Support class.

01:35:37.949 --> 01:35:39.171
MATT: Don't forget your first level spells, yo.

01:35:39.171 --> 01:35:41.061
Some of them really scale well.

01:35:41.061 --> 01:35:42.194
MARISHA: Yeah, they do.

01:35:43.801 --> 01:35:46.701
Okay. First hit.

01:35:46.701 --> 01:35:48.091
Oh, I said unarmed strike.

01:35:48.091 --> 01:35:48.924
MATT: Yeah.
MARISHA: Okay.

01:35:48.924 --> 01:35:51.291
That was-- that was good.

01:35:51.291 --> 01:35:52.966
That was an eight. So.

01:35:54.359 --> 01:35:56.081
Sorry, 20....

01:35:56.081 --> 01:35:56.914
Sorry. No.

01:35:56.914 --> 01:35:59.826
13 damage on the first one.

01:36:01.391 --> 01:36:02.301
And that was a seven.

01:36:02.301 --> 01:36:05.021
So 12 damage.
MATT: 12 damage. Nice.

01:36:05.021 --> 01:36:07.371
So as you reach up towards the one eye that's in reach,

01:36:07.371 --> 01:36:09.661
you punch up there once,

01:36:09.661 --> 01:36:12.524
and the eye seems to almost
split against the edge of the fist.

01:36:12.524 --> 01:36:14.354
With the other hand, you reach up up and gouge through

01:36:14.354 --> 01:36:16.403
and one of the eyes is just ruined.

01:36:16.403 --> 01:36:17.911
MARISHA: Full-on tiger claw.

01:36:17.911 --> 01:36:19.471
MATT: The interior jelly viscera

01:36:19.471 --> 01:36:20.788
begins to leak down the front of its face

01:36:20.788 --> 01:36:22.905
and its mouth opens once more as it goes,

01:36:22.905 --> 01:36:25.875
(deep-voiced baby crying)

01:36:25.875 --> 01:36:30.211
MARISHA: I just take whatever
breath I have left in his grasp

01:36:30.211 --> 01:36:32.701
and I just say: Fucking kill him!

01:36:32.701 --> 01:36:33.692
To the rest of my team.

01:36:33.692 --> 01:36:35.232
MATT: Caduceus, you're up. Caleb, you're on deck.

01:36:35.232 --> 01:36:36.640
LIAM: Okay.

01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:39.031
TALIESIN: All right. I'm going to

01:36:39.031 --> 01:36:40.306
hit him with a Blight spell.

01:36:40.306 --> 01:36:41.755
LIAM: Yeah, murder it.
MATT: Which one?

01:36:41.755 --> 01:36:43.272
TALIESIN: Blight.
MATT: Blight, okay.

01:36:43.272 --> 01:36:45.348
Constitution save?
LIAM: Finish it.

01:36:45.348 --> 01:36:46.181
TALIESIN: No.

01:36:46.181 --> 01:36:48.159
It's not a constitution spell.

01:36:48.159 --> 01:36:50.401
LIAM: Well no, what's its save on the spell?

01:36:50.401 --> 01:36:51.234
TALIESIN: Oh, it's-- I'm sorry.

01:36:51.234 --> 01:36:52.541
Constitution save.
MATT: There we go.

01:36:52.541 --> 01:36:54.938
TALIESIN: Sorry. Yeah.
(laughter)

01:36:54.938 --> 01:36:56.271
LIAM: Finish him.

01:36:56.271 --> 01:36:57.821
MATT: It's a 16.

01:36:58.988 --> 01:37:00.988
TALIESIN: Nope.
MATT: All righty.

01:37:04.381 --> 01:37:05.661
TALIESIN: 31 points of damage.

01:37:05.661 --> 01:37:06.494
MATT: How do you want to do this?

01:37:06.494 --> 01:37:08.685
(cheering and applause)

01:37:10.088 --> 01:37:10.929
TRAVIS: There we go.

01:37:10.929 --> 01:37:13.001
LIAM: Cad kill.
MARISHA: Cad kill.

01:37:13.001 --> 01:37:15.801
TALIESIN: I'm just going to--
I've had enough of this, I'm panicking.

01:37:15.801 --> 01:37:17.601
I'm going to just stab my staff into the ground.

01:37:17.601 --> 01:37:21.459
I'm going to just stab my staff into the ground.

01:37:21.459 --> 01:37:24.981
The hand around the crystals
just going to get a little tighter on the crystal.

01:37:24.981 --> 01:37:29.461
I'm going to look weirdly necrotic that I don't normally do.

01:37:29.461 --> 01:37:31.953
And just a beam is going to hit out

01:37:31.953 --> 01:37:34.954
and just start sucking all the moisture out of this thing.

01:37:34.954 --> 01:37:35.787
SAM: Ooh.

01:37:35.787 --> 01:37:37.501
LAURA: It's Galadriel when she goes dark.

01:37:37.501 --> 01:37:38.481
MATT: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Ooh.

01:37:38.481 --> 01:37:40.090
MATT: As Caduceus is doing this,

01:37:40.090 --> 01:37:42.031
and you watch his hair began to rise up a little bit

01:37:42.031 --> 01:37:43.591
around him from the necrotic energy,

01:37:43.591 --> 01:37:46.561
his robe around him just flowing slightly.

01:37:46.561 --> 01:37:48.871
A wind that is sourceless seems to be blowing

01:37:48.871 --> 01:37:50.350
past him as he does this.

01:37:50.350 --> 01:37:51.397
And as the creature turns around,

01:37:51.397 --> 01:37:53.271
(monstrous crying)

01:37:53.271 --> 01:37:56.713
you watch as the eye that's
currently dripped the viscera

01:37:56.713 --> 01:37:59.754
just suddenly turns to mist,

01:37:59.754 --> 01:38:01.578
the liquid and blood that's pouring out its wounds

01:38:01.578 --> 01:38:03.801
begin to just dissipate,

01:38:03.801 --> 01:38:05.901
like it's being cooked from the inside.

01:38:05.901 --> 01:38:07.851
And as it begins to stumble towards you,

01:38:07.851 --> 01:38:10.071
its first arm falls on the ground.

01:38:10.071 --> 01:38:13.283
Its ankle buckles. The other one

01:38:13.283 --> 01:38:14.861
(impact and gurgling)

01:38:14.861 --> 01:38:17.781
and you watch as the skin begins to crack and flake away.

01:38:17.781 --> 01:38:21.211
Eventually, the other eye just turns extremely hard

01:38:21.211 --> 01:38:22.381
and then crumbles into dust,

01:38:22.381 --> 01:38:24.501
its two empty sockets now looking towards you.

01:38:24.501 --> 01:38:27.704
It takes its final fall onto the ground.

01:38:28.611 --> 01:38:30.201
And as its skin begins to pull back

01:38:30.201 --> 01:38:32.334
and crack at all the corners,

01:38:33.631 --> 01:38:34.906
it is no more.

01:38:36.041 --> 01:38:40.381
SAM: Now Matthew, did he pull a Sam Riegel and also kill me?

01:38:40.381 --> 01:38:41.739
MATT: No.
SAM: Okay.

01:38:41.739 --> 01:38:42.821
(laughter)

01:38:42.821 --> 01:38:45.381
TALIESIN: That acid is probably gone, though.

01:38:45.381 --> 01:38:46.488
MATT: Hmm. Hmm.

01:38:46.488 --> 01:38:48.255
The inside is not [Inaudible].

01:38:48.255 --> 01:38:50.088
ASHLEY: Can I try to?

01:38:50.088 --> 01:38:51.461
MATT: It's not yet your turn.

01:38:51.461 --> 01:38:55.304
Caleb and Jester and Fjord all have their turns

01:38:55.304 --> 01:38:57.121
right now to react to this

01:38:57.121 --> 01:38:58.462
as it falls to the ground.

01:38:58.462 --> 01:39:00.012
Veth is-- you are released from it.

01:39:00.012 --> 01:39:02.612
You fall back on the ground, no longer grasped by its arms.

01:39:02.612 --> 01:39:04.731
But Veth is still within the creature.

01:39:04.731 --> 01:39:05.601
What are you doing?

01:39:05.601 --> 01:39:08.377
LIAM: I can't see the map or where I am.

01:39:08.377 --> 01:39:11.321
TALIESIN: I also would've backed--
MATT: Oh, you're over here.

01:39:11.321 --> 01:39:12.213
LIAM: Yeah.

01:39:12.213 --> 01:39:13.681
(inhales)

01:39:13.681 --> 01:39:14.514
Man.

01:39:17.487 --> 01:39:18.711
TRAVIS: I mean, we're running over

01:39:18.711 --> 01:39:20.881
and trying to pull Veth out of its mouth, right?

01:39:20.881 --> 01:39:22.573
LAURA: Yeah. You can get-- I don't think

01:39:22.573 --> 01:39:25.201
either me or Caleb can get there in time, but you can.

01:39:25.201 --> 01:39:28.963
I'm going to hold my heal spell as well.

01:39:28.963 --> 01:39:31.431
MATT: Okay.
LAURA: For when Veth pops out.

01:39:31.431 --> 01:39:32.617
MATT: You've got it.

01:39:32.617 --> 01:39:33.642
Okay.

01:39:33.642 --> 01:39:36.751
TRAVIS: Yeah. I'll run over and pull open the upper lip

01:39:36.751 --> 01:39:40.422
and shove my hand in there and see if I can find Veth.

01:39:40.422 --> 01:39:41.463
MATT: Okay.

01:39:41.463 --> 01:39:43.761
So you go ahead and your movement to get

01:39:43.761 --> 01:39:47.104
around over there would be, since it is on the ground.

01:39:48.053 --> 01:39:48.886
TRAVIS: From a-noos to mouth.

01:39:48.886 --> 01:39:50.551
MATT: 25, 30, you can get there.

01:39:50.551 --> 01:39:53.044
You will have enough.

01:39:54.713 --> 01:39:56.591
I'll say as your action.

01:39:56.591 --> 01:39:57.424
Yeah.

01:39:57.424 --> 01:39:59.921
You have just enough to barely pull Veth free of the mouth.

01:39:59.921 --> 01:40:02.058
But that's the extent of it, I'll say.

01:40:02.058 --> 01:40:02.891
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:40:02.891 --> 01:40:05.221
MATT: So as you reach in and yank her out,

01:40:05.221 --> 01:40:06.351
it's odd because now that

01:40:06.351 --> 01:40:08.531
the moisture's been drawn from a large portion

01:40:08.531 --> 01:40:12.509
of the outside of its body's immediate layer,

01:40:12.509 --> 01:40:13.384
when you're trying to reach through,

01:40:13.384 --> 01:40:16.141
it's like trying to push through dried bush.

01:40:16.141 --> 01:40:18.411
It cracks and splinters

01:40:18.411 --> 01:40:22.521
as your arms go in and you, (grunts) yank Veth out.

01:40:22.521 --> 01:40:23.696
Coated in the--

01:40:23.696 --> 01:40:25.611
SAM: Oh, there's no roll or anything, it just happens?

01:40:25.611 --> 01:40:26.710
MATT: No, it's dead.

01:40:26.710 --> 01:40:28.768
There's just no resistance beyond just--

01:40:28.768 --> 01:40:30.601
SAM: What is this strange,

01:40:30.601 --> 01:40:32.201
small twig that's grabbing me,

01:40:32.201 --> 01:40:34.724
this tiny little piece of.

01:40:34.724 --> 01:40:36.361
TRAVIS: (deep resonant voice) I've got you, Veth.

01:40:36.361 --> 01:40:38.090
SAM: Oh, oh.

01:40:38.090 --> 01:40:39.523
That was a...
TRAVIS: Everything's going to be fine.

01:40:39.523 --> 01:40:41.271
SAM: That was a body-- that was your body?

01:40:41.271 --> 01:40:42.719
I thought that wrist was just--

01:40:42.719 --> 01:40:45.531
TRAVIS: Those are my pectorals
pressing up against your face.

01:40:45.531 --> 01:40:46.581
SAM: It was so skinny.

01:40:46.581 --> 01:40:49.261
TRAVIS: I have you. It's okay.

01:40:49.261 --> 01:40:50.541
Here.
SAM: Oh my god.

01:40:50.541 --> 01:40:51.965
TRAVIS: I'm going to clean you off a little bit.

01:40:51.965 --> 01:40:52.901
(laughter)

01:40:52.901 --> 01:40:55.403
SAM: He's just wiping my face with his giant hands.

01:40:55.403 --> 01:40:56.573
(laughter)

01:40:56.573 --> 01:40:58.889
LAURA: The duplicate's going to go up and touch Veth

01:40:58.889 --> 01:41:00.691
and cast Cure Wounds at 5th-level.

01:41:00.691 --> 01:41:04.075
MATT: You got it. So go ahead and roll a heal on that.

01:41:04.921 --> 01:41:08.081
As the rest of you are taking a moment to breathe

01:41:08.081 --> 01:41:11.951
from whatever this terrible, unexpected encounter was.

01:41:11.951 --> 01:41:12.845
We're going to go ahead and take a break.

01:41:12.845 --> 01:41:14.091
(oohing)

01:41:14.091 --> 01:41:15.357
MATT: It's been a little bit.

01:41:15.357 --> 01:41:16.852
We'll be back here in a little minute to

01:41:16.852 --> 01:41:18.531
see what the aftermath of this encounter is

01:41:18.531 --> 01:41:20.801
and what this now-open chamber

01:41:20.801 --> 01:41:23.201
it stemmed from holds and has in store.

01:41:23.201 --> 01:41:24.834
So we'll see you here in a few minutes.

01:41:25.904 --> 01:41:28.624
Now experience the ultimate way to play,

01:41:28.624 --> 01:41:31.614
by sitting at a table with your friends

01:41:31.614 --> 01:41:33.594
with your face in a screen.

01:41:33.594 --> 01:41:34.904
Progress!

01:41:34.904 --> 01:41:36.884
D&amp;D Beyond.

01:41:36.884 --> 01:41:40.834
Log in to explore strange worlds and fantastical cities,

01:41:40.834 --> 01:41:43.944
thanks to a company based in a really boring one,

01:41:43.944 --> 01:41:45.344
that handles all the tedious

01:41:45.344 --> 01:41:47.114
math and reference stuff for you,

01:41:47.114 --> 01:41:49.504
so you can finally unleash the epic quest

01:41:49.504 --> 01:41:52.394
you've been crafting since middle school on your friends.

01:41:52.394 --> 01:41:54.654
Or just do what most people us it for,

01:41:54.654 --> 01:41:56.274
cranking out endless new characters

01:41:56.274 --> 01:41:57.604
while they're bored at work.

01:41:57.604 --> 01:41:59.294
I could finish these spreadsheets,

01:41:59.294 --> 01:42:02.687
but what if this paladin owned a horse?

01:42:02.687 --> 01:42:04.534
(romantic music)

01:42:04.534 --> 01:42:05.754
Perfect.

01:42:05.754 --> 01:42:09.057
D&amp;D Beyond. Play with advantage.

01:42:09.936 --> 01:42:12.304
It was the night before Winter's Crest.

01:42:12.304 --> 01:42:14.881
And all through the Xhorhaus.

01:42:14.881 --> 01:42:18.064
All the Mighty Nein was stirring.

01:42:18.064 --> 01:42:20.127
Not a creature was stirring.

01:42:21.134 --> 01:42:26.134
The Mighty Nein was stirring. Even a little mouse.

01:42:28.164 --> 01:42:29.337
It can't be mouse.

01:42:31.137 --> 01:42:33.637
(chill music)

01:42:47.464 --> 01:42:49.644
Hey Critters, Laura Bailey here.

01:42:49.644 --> 01:42:52.047
Let's see what's up in the Critical Role shop.

01:42:52.957 --> 01:42:57.907
This holiday season, give the gift of effortless style.

01:43:00.494 --> 01:43:01.914
I mean, the Traveler always says,

01:43:01.914 --> 01:43:04.227
impulse purchases are a good decision.

01:43:06.754 --> 01:43:08.787
It's so cute, I can't handle it.

01:43:11.777 --> 01:43:14.061
The cuteness, it's overpowering!

01:43:17.194 --> 01:43:20.407
These holidays, you know, they're just around the corner.

01:43:21.904 --> 01:43:23.844
This is, this is a lot of stuff, you guys.

01:43:23.844 --> 01:43:26.547
We have like so many cool things right now.

01:43:28.404 --> 01:43:31.944
Ooh, look at this! Look at the details, ooh!

01:43:35.182 --> 01:43:38.034
So click on over to the Critical Role shop.

01:43:38.034 --> 01:43:39.924
Don't worry, there's a few more minutes in the break.

01:43:39.924 --> 01:43:40.874
You still got time.

01:43:47.394 --> 01:43:49.604
Like a symphony playing to an empty theater,

01:43:49.604 --> 01:43:53.024
Critical Role dines alone without its audience.

01:43:53.024 --> 01:43:57.284
Yes, that validating and most enthusiastic congregation

01:43:57.284 --> 01:44:00.824
on the other side of the fourth wall.

01:44:00.824 --> 01:44:03.234
And what is this fourth wall

01:44:03.234 --> 01:44:05.854
separating the viewer from the creator?

01:44:05.854 --> 01:44:08.704
A portal to an often sought point of connection,

01:44:08.704 --> 01:44:11.937
or the Twitch subscription zone?

01:44:12.994 --> 01:44:15.654
On the rare occasion that you miss the live bacchanal

01:44:15.654 --> 01:44:19.534
boasted by the rag-tag group of thespians on Thursday night,

01:44:19.534 --> 01:44:21.794
you may always view the show on demand

01:44:21.794 --> 01:44:26.484
in the shadow land known as the Twitch subscription zone.

01:44:26.484 --> 01:44:27.664
Picture, if you will,

01:44:27.664 --> 01:44:30.904
the necessary pieces to complete a jigsaw puzzle,

01:44:30.904 --> 01:44:34.334
but it's up to you to choose how it will be solved.

01:44:34.334 --> 01:44:37.824
You could, of course, subscribe with your debt rectangle,

01:44:37.824 --> 01:44:40.954
but many more divergent paths lie before you.

01:44:40.954 --> 01:44:43.704
Perhaps you found yourself in possession of

01:44:43.704 --> 01:44:46.087
an Amazon Prime account.

01:44:46.087 --> 01:44:48.034
You would then wake up to discover

01:44:48.034 --> 01:44:50.224
a free Twitch subscription each month

01:44:50.224 --> 01:44:52.434
for a channel of your choosing.

01:44:52.434 --> 01:44:54.554
But this artifact demands renewal,

01:44:54.554 --> 01:44:57.234
for you must re-subscribe each month to quench

01:44:57.234 --> 01:44:58.727
its unyielding thirst.

01:44:59.694 --> 01:45:01.684
One need not walk alone.

01:45:01.684 --> 01:45:03.494
Those who have already found their way

01:45:03.494 --> 01:45:05.774
can illuminate the path for others

01:45:05.774 --> 01:45:08.567
via the gift a sub button on Twitch.

01:45:09.874 --> 01:45:12.704
Critical Role is humbled by your subscription,

01:45:12.704 --> 01:45:14.944
and wishes to thank you from behind the thin veil

01:45:14.944 --> 01:45:17.674
of this fourth wall.

01:45:17.674 --> 01:45:21.294
We hope you enjoy our content as much as we enjoy making it,

01:45:21.294 --> 01:45:24.154
and so ends another meandering digression,

01:45:24.154 --> 01:45:27.844
a complicated parody promo down an indistinct highway

01:45:27.844 --> 01:45:31.847
to the region we call the Twitch subscription zone.

01:45:35.029 --> 01:45:37.612
(spooky music)

01:45:40.514 --> 01:45:41.987
You will subscribe.

01:45:43.574 --> 01:45:46.217
Twitch Prime subscribe.

01:45:47.162 --> 01:45:48.137
Gift subscribe.

01:45:49.994 --> 01:45:52.057
Subscribe.

01:58:51.967 --> 01:58:55.376
MATT: And welcome back. So.

01:58:55.376 --> 01:58:58.095
Recovering from that unexpected encounter

01:58:58.095 --> 01:59:01.378
with the terrifying beast that now lies dead

01:59:01.378 --> 01:59:04.802
and drying in the center of the laboratory floor.

01:59:04.802 --> 01:59:06.052
What do you do?

01:59:07.684 --> 01:59:08.534
SAM: Loot the body.

01:59:08.534 --> 01:59:09.945
MARISHA: Fuck. Yes.

01:59:09.945 --> 01:59:11.499
SAM: We fuck?

01:59:11.499 --> 01:59:12.774
MARISHA: I mean,

01:59:12.774 --> 01:59:15.407
anything right now to feel alive.

01:59:15.407 --> 01:59:16.407
TRAVIS: Maybe not fuck.

01:59:16.407 --> 01:59:17.663
MARISHA: Yeah, okay.

01:59:17.663 --> 01:59:18.779
ASHLEY: Well.
MARISHA: I mean.

01:59:18.779 --> 01:59:20.766
TRAVIS: I don't know if there's much to loot.

01:59:20.766 --> 01:59:23.667
SAM: We could take some meat in case we get hungry later.

01:59:23.667 --> 01:59:25.067
LIAM: I do. I'm picking up its--
TALIESIN: I wouldn't eat that.

01:59:25.067 --> 01:59:27.839
LIAM: -- oversized eyeball.
MARISHA: I don't know where the fucking came from.

01:59:27.839 --> 01:59:28.830
TRAVIS: Can I--

01:59:28.830 --> 01:59:31.301
MATT: Both of the eyes have have dried.

01:59:31.301 --> 01:59:32.752
LIAM: The one that Fjord cut out?
LAURA: What about the--?

01:59:32.752 --> 01:59:34.737
MATT: Oh, sorry, you mean the bulb?

01:59:34.737 --> 01:59:35.808
Yeah. You can totally take that.

01:59:35.808 --> 01:59:36.949
LIAM: Yeah.
LAURA: Ew.

01:59:36.949 --> 01:59:38.815
TALIESIN: Yeah, that's actually good.
MATT: It's about that large.

01:59:38.815 --> 01:59:40.197
Like, when you get up close to it,

01:59:40.197 --> 01:59:41.779
it's about the size of a cantaloupe,

01:59:41.779 --> 01:59:45.174
and there's still about maybe seven to eight inches of

01:59:45.174 --> 01:59:48.180
the stalk attached to it that is severed.

01:59:48.180 --> 01:59:50.788
And you can see that its dark,

01:59:50.788 --> 01:59:53.313
purple-brown blood that has now splattered

01:59:53.313 --> 01:59:54.459
on the ground beside it.

01:59:54.459 --> 01:59:58.217
It has no life, but it is definitely carriable.

01:59:58.217 --> 02:00:00.194
LIAM: Then for the time being, I'm going to take the stalk

02:00:00.194 --> 02:00:02.786
and tie a knot on my belt.

02:00:02.786 --> 02:00:05.774
MATT: You got it, cool.
LIAM: Let it hang there.

02:00:05.774 --> 02:00:07.825
TALIESIN: That's a good idea.
LAURA: That's really gross, Caleb.

02:00:07.825 --> 02:00:09.560
TRAVIS: I'm going to run over to the door that opened and

02:00:09.560 --> 02:00:10.804
unleashed this terrible thing

02:00:10.804 --> 02:00:13.691
and just peer into the hallway 60 feet.

02:00:13.691 --> 02:00:15.984
MATT: Okay.
ASHLEY: I'm going to stand beside Fjord.

02:00:15.984 --> 02:00:18.225
MATT: Okay. As you both square off and look down.

02:00:18.225 --> 02:00:19.804
This is a similar corridor

02:00:19.804 --> 02:00:22.573
to the one that you came through to enter here.

02:00:22.573 --> 02:00:25.768
It is a little larger than 15 feet wide,

02:00:25.768 --> 02:00:26.821
and about as tall.

02:00:26.821 --> 02:00:29.381
It is metal lined top to bottom.

02:00:29.381 --> 02:00:31.567
The floor appears to be stone or marble

02:00:31.567 --> 02:00:34.162
without texture to it, necessarily,

02:00:34.162 --> 02:00:36.850
and about 30 feet in, you can start seeing elements

02:00:36.850 --> 02:00:38.341
of the walls that are heavily cracked

02:00:38.341 --> 02:00:39.433
and some elements have fallen in.

02:00:39.433 --> 02:00:42.736
You can see, similar to the previous passage way,

02:00:42.736 --> 02:00:45.719
some cabling and

02:00:45.719 --> 02:00:47.619
beams of some kind have crumbled in a bit,

02:00:47.619 --> 02:00:48.679
but a lot of them been pushed

02:00:48.679 --> 02:00:50.795
by this creature making its way through.

02:00:50.795 --> 02:00:51.980
And you can see where it's

02:00:51.980 --> 02:00:56.647
carved through brute force its way through this hall.

02:00:57.905 --> 02:01:00.306
LAURA: I'm assuming that that fight

02:01:00.306 --> 02:01:03.413
didn't take more than a couple of minutes total.

02:01:03.413 --> 02:01:05.294
MATT: The whole fight was less than a minute.

02:01:05.294 --> 02:01:09.233
LAURA: Wow. So my Locate Object would still be up.

02:01:09.233 --> 02:01:11.531
MATT: Well, is it concentration?

02:01:11.531 --> 02:01:13.081
LAURA: Probably.

02:01:13.081 --> 02:01:13.942
MATT: I'm pretty sure it is.

02:01:13.942 --> 02:01:17.221
And when you summoned your--

02:01:17.221 --> 02:01:18.454
LAURA: Oh, my duplicate.
MATT: Your duplicate, it would have lost it.

02:01:18.454 --> 02:01:19.287
LAURA: Yeah, you're right.

02:01:20.131 --> 02:01:22.317
LIAM: I wouldn't mind taking a breather here

02:01:22.317 --> 02:01:25.539
if we feel like we could afford it.

02:01:25.539 --> 02:01:27.030
ASHLEY: I mean.
MARISHA: Yeah. Why not?

02:01:27.030 --> 02:01:28.330
TALIESIN: Sure.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:01:28.330 --> 02:01:29.223
SAM: Short rest?

02:01:29.223 --> 02:01:30.643
LIAM: Yeah.
LAURA: Short rest.

02:01:30.643 --> 02:01:32.228
LIAM: Yes, please.

02:01:32.228 --> 02:01:33.093
MATT: All right.

02:01:33.093 --> 02:01:34.542
You guys can set yourselves up for a short rest.

02:01:34.542 --> 02:01:37.131
Use your hit dice to heal up if you got them.

02:01:37.131 --> 02:01:38.014
Get your spells back.

02:01:38.014 --> 02:01:40.407
MARISHA: Oh yeah, Caduceus is there anything that you

02:01:40.407 --> 02:01:42.841
have that might want to help with that?

02:01:42.841 --> 02:01:46.915
Or, you know, Jester, I don't want to assume.

02:01:46.915 --> 02:01:48.345
LAURA: I mean, if we're taking a rest,

02:01:48.345 --> 02:01:50.770
why would I use my spells to help out with that?

02:01:50.770 --> 02:01:52.275
MARISHA: Exactly. So Caduceus?

02:01:52.275 --> 02:01:53.705
TALIESIN: How down are you?

02:01:53.705 --> 02:01:54.705
MARISHA: To half.

02:01:55.788 --> 02:01:57.638
A little over.

02:01:57.638 --> 02:01:59.827
TALIESIN: Technically, I can keep healing after

02:01:59.827 --> 02:02:02.527
she's burned all of her hit dice, right?

02:02:02.527 --> 02:02:05.938
MARISHA: I do have full hit dice, so I can go there first.

02:02:05.938 --> 02:02:07.404
TALIESIN: I'd say hit dice first.

02:02:07.404 --> 02:02:09.345
Because that way, if you do go down again,

02:02:09.345 --> 02:02:10.619
I can just pop you back up.

02:02:10.619 --> 02:02:13.713
Whereas hit dice are-- this is all that they're good for.

02:02:13.713 --> 02:02:14.949
LAURA: Yeah. Yeah.

02:02:14.949 --> 02:02:16.963
That's what I meant, Beau.

02:02:16.963 --> 02:02:18.104
Definitely.

02:02:18.104 --> 02:02:20.912
I will do the same if something happens to you later.

02:02:20.912 --> 02:02:23.233
I want to be able to help you, you know?

02:02:23.233 --> 02:02:25.290
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:02:25.290 --> 02:02:26.123
TALIESIN: If it makes you feel better,

02:02:26.123 --> 02:02:28.438
I've always got the one where if I hit somebody

02:02:28.438 --> 02:02:30.344
and they're unconscious, they just (explosion).

02:02:30.344 --> 02:02:31.725
You know, they're just way better.

02:02:31.725 --> 02:02:36.725
LAURA: I've got the big bad guys packed as well.

02:02:36.784 --> 02:02:39.692
TALIESIN: Somebody needs to like hit hard, so.

02:02:39.692 --> 02:02:40.933
LAURA: Right.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:02:40.933 --> 02:02:42.733
LIAM: Just for transparency,

02:02:42.733 --> 02:02:44.824
I'm going to use Arcane Recovery to pull back

02:02:44.824 --> 02:02:47.513
my 7th-level spell.

02:02:47.513 --> 02:02:50.088
MATT: Can you--
LIAM: Slot. It's-- Yeah.

02:02:50.088 --> 02:02:53.526
Half your level rounded up.

02:02:53.526 --> 02:02:55.674
MATT: Rounded up? Okay. Then, yeah. Go for it.

02:02:55.674 --> 02:02:58.682
TALIESIN: How long is a short rest, out of the curiosity?

02:02:58.682 --> 02:03:00.935
LAURA: An hour.
TALIESIN: Okay, great.

02:03:00.935 --> 02:03:02.850
I have an eight-hour spell still up.

02:03:02.850 --> 02:03:04.519
LAURA: Nice. Yes.

02:03:04.519 --> 02:03:05.886
Death Ward, right?
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:03:05.886 --> 02:03:07.808
MATT: "But none of the slots can be 6th-level or higher."

02:03:07.808 --> 02:03:09.531
LIAM: Oh, can't be sixth or higher?

02:03:09.531 --> 02:03:10.623
Thank you for catching that.

02:03:10.623 --> 02:03:11.481
MATT: No worries. I was wondering about it.

02:03:11.481 --> 02:03:14.823
I think it was one to 5th-level
are the limitations on it.

02:03:14.823 --> 02:03:17.191
LIAM: We are sleeping in the dome tonight, people.

02:03:17.191 --> 02:03:18.390
TALIESIN: That's okay.

02:03:18.390 --> 02:03:19.541
LAURA: That's okay.

02:03:20.899 --> 02:03:23.619
LIAM: You two were in rare form.

02:03:23.619 --> 02:03:25.530
You decimated it.

02:03:25.530 --> 02:03:27.547
LAURA: (intense powerful noise)

02:03:27.547 --> 02:03:29.059
This was pretty impressive.

02:03:29.059 --> 02:03:30.867
That was the most I've ever done

02:03:30.867 --> 02:03:33.055
on something like that for sure.

02:03:33.055 --> 02:03:34.075
SAM: You mean damage?

02:03:34.075 --> 02:03:37.152
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: It was very impressive.

02:03:37.152 --> 02:03:39.577
MARISHA: Yeah. I feel like between this and the worm

02:03:39.577 --> 02:03:44.553
I'm questioning my,

02:03:44.553 --> 02:03:48.159
you know, usefulness, but it'll be great.

02:03:48.159 --> 02:03:51.047
LAURA: What are you talking, Beau?

02:03:51.047 --> 02:03:54.649
SAM: You landed some solid biffs and bams.

02:03:54.649 --> 02:03:56.021
LIAM: Oh yeah, just to make you feel better,

02:03:56.021 --> 02:04:00.264
I did literally nothing the entire time.

02:04:00.264 --> 02:04:03.159
I think I saw you smacking it in the face a few.

02:04:03.159 --> 02:04:05.358
MARISHA: That does make me feel better, thank you.

02:04:05.358 --> 02:04:06.191
Yeah.

02:04:06.191 --> 02:04:08.937
LIAM: You two, though, are good with babies.

02:04:08.937 --> 02:04:12.404
(laughter)

02:04:12.404 --> 02:04:14.002
TALIESIN: Putting them down.

02:04:14.002 --> 02:04:16.499
Just really doing some damage.

02:04:16.499 --> 02:04:18.799
LAURA: Yeah, what?

02:04:18.799 --> 02:04:21.585
LIAM: It can be hard to put a baby down.

02:04:21.585 --> 02:04:23.027
They would just keep getting back up.

02:04:23.027 --> 02:04:24.783
LAURA: I've heard.
LIAM: Yeah.

02:04:24.783 --> 02:04:29.783
MARISHA: I spent a lot of good drugs on that baby.

02:04:30.470 --> 02:04:31.453
LAURA: What do you mean?

02:04:31.453 --> 02:04:33.922
How, how, how?

02:04:33.922 --> 02:04:38.922
MARISHA: I, you know, I had that whole package of suude.

02:04:39.151 --> 02:04:41.401
That was a lot of suude,

02:04:41.401 --> 02:04:43.634
and I thought maybe I could take it down from inside

02:04:43.634 --> 02:04:46.409
when I was in there, but

02:04:46.409 --> 02:04:50.799
I think it just knocked it unconscious for a hot second.

02:04:50.799 --> 02:04:52.389
That's it.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah!

02:04:52.389 --> 02:04:53.822
ASHLEY: Yeah. That's why he fell over.

02:04:53.822 --> 02:04:56.569
MARISHA: Babies are resilient, turns out.

02:04:56.569 --> 02:04:59.037
LIAM: Yeah. Well, at his sort of girth and density,

02:04:59.037 --> 02:05:01.405
I imagine that was more like a microdose.

02:05:01.405 --> 02:05:03.371
MARISHA: Probably, yeah. You're not wrong.

02:05:03.371 --> 02:05:04.296
LIAM: Got the job done, though.

02:05:04.296 --> 02:05:05.379
You're here, breathing.

02:05:05.379 --> 02:05:07.462
LAURA: That's right, worth it.

02:05:08.595 --> 02:05:09.987
MARISHA: I'll find more drugs.

02:05:10.821 --> 02:05:11.654
I'll find more drugs.

02:05:11.654 --> 02:05:13.710
There are more drugs.

02:05:13.710 --> 02:05:14.836
SAM: There's more drugs out there.

02:05:14.836 --> 02:05:17.027
MARISHA: There are, you're right.

02:05:17.027 --> 02:05:18.142
It gives me hope.

02:05:18.142 --> 02:05:20.812
SAM: Yeah. Some something to keep going for.

02:05:20.812 --> 02:05:23.537
LIAM: The drugs will come out tomorrow.

02:05:25.620 --> 02:05:27.956
Bet your bottom dollar. Right, Yasha?

02:05:27.956 --> 02:05:30.143
ASHLEY: Yes. That tomorrow there will be sun.

02:05:30.143 --> 02:05:31.709
LIAM: Yeah.
ASHLEY: Yeah.

02:05:31.709 --> 02:05:33.058
Wait, question, though.
SAM: Drugs.

02:05:33.058 --> 02:05:35.131
ASHLEY: There will be drugs, sorry,

02:05:35.131 --> 02:05:37.398
but that's a specific kind of drug that I know about.

02:05:37.398 --> 02:05:39.403
SAM: Oh! Sun is a drug?

02:05:39.403 --> 02:05:41.748
ASHLEY: It's, mm.
(chef's kiss) Delightful.

02:05:41.748 --> 02:05:44.431
(laughter)

02:05:44.431 --> 02:05:45.681
SAM: Canon.

02:05:45.681 --> 02:05:46.856
TALIESIN: Canon.

02:05:46.856 --> 02:05:50.392
ASHLEY: Wait, what is this?

02:05:50.392 --> 02:05:52.142
Is this...
SAM: The baby?

02:05:53.698 --> 02:05:55.667
ASHLEY: Was this made?
TRAVIS: The elephant baby?

02:05:55.667 --> 02:05:56.933
ASHLEY: I don't understand.
LAURA: I think it had to be.

02:05:56.933 --> 02:05:58.341
This isn't natural.

02:05:58.341 --> 02:05:59.934
Right? Did they make this here?

02:05:59.934 --> 02:06:01.732
Has it been alive this whole time?

02:06:01.732 --> 02:06:04.473
ASHLEY: Is this a biological weapon?

02:06:04.473 --> 02:06:06.705
SAM: Yeah, maybe they made it here.

02:06:06.705 --> 02:06:10.096
Have I heard of such a baby before?

02:06:11.293 --> 02:06:14.159
MATT: You can go ahead and roll a history--

02:06:14.159 --> 02:06:17.183
Well, history or arcana, your call.

02:06:17.183 --> 02:06:20.463
LAURA: Would it be in any creepy, scary stories

02:06:20.463 --> 02:06:23.513
Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark books that I have

02:06:23.513 --> 02:06:25.299
in my collection at home?

02:06:25.299 --> 02:06:26.730
MATT: No.
LAURA: Damn.

02:06:26.730 --> 02:06:27.871
SAM: 22.
MATT: You have no idea.

02:06:27.871 --> 02:06:31.079
LIAM: Well, there are books on the infernal

02:06:31.079 --> 02:06:34.699
and all kinds of strange oddities across the planes.

02:06:34.699 --> 02:06:37.787
This could be anything.

02:06:37.787 --> 02:06:39.088
TALIESIN: I think it's a lot of things.

02:06:39.088 --> 02:06:40.513
LAURA: I read about this lady once

02:06:40.513 --> 02:06:43.317
who had a spider that laid eggs in her cheek.

02:06:43.317 --> 02:06:45.953
And then they exploded out.

02:06:45.953 --> 02:06:47.329
SAM: Out of the outside of the cheek?

02:06:47.329 --> 02:06:49.450
LAURA: Yeah. Like the eggs hatched in the cheek,

02:06:49.450 --> 02:06:51.583
and the spider eggs went everywhere.

02:06:51.583 --> 02:06:52.416
TRAVIS: This is amazing.

02:06:52.416 --> 02:06:53.776
Aren't we on a bit of a clock?

02:06:53.776 --> 02:06:55.454
SAM: Oh yeah.
LAURA: Yeah. Well, we're resting.

02:06:55.454 --> 02:06:57.657
That's why we're, you know, we can't do anything.

02:06:57.657 --> 02:06:59.953
But I'm assuming it's been about an hour now.

02:06:59.953 --> 02:07:01.650
ASHLEY: How long--
MATT: Sure, we can jump ahead.

02:07:01.650 --> 02:07:02.893
ASHLEY: How long would it take

02:07:02.893 --> 02:07:07.807
if I were to cut and take the spine with me?

02:07:07.807 --> 02:07:10.571
SAM and LIAM: Oh my gosh.

02:07:10.571 --> 02:07:12.321
MARISHA: She can make more bone harps,

02:07:12.321 --> 02:07:14.289
like eight more bone harps.

02:07:14.289 --> 02:07:15.951
TRAVIS: That's, like, a cello.

02:07:15.951 --> 02:07:17.178
MATT: If you wanted to take some time,

02:07:17.178 --> 02:07:19.093
you could carve some bone out of it.

02:07:19.093 --> 02:07:21.312
The spine is heavy.

02:07:21.312 --> 02:07:24.181
I mean, the entire creature in its own right

02:07:24.181 --> 02:07:27.015
weighs well over a ton or two.

02:07:27.015 --> 02:07:28.383
ASHLEY: Okay, we don't have time.

02:07:28.383 --> 02:07:29.896
I just was thinking this would be--

02:07:29.896 --> 02:07:31.429
I saw his body and it was like,

02:07:31.429 --> 02:07:32.694
"This would be a beautiful instrument."

02:07:32.694 --> 02:07:36.214
MATT: You can carve some bone from it, if you'd like, yeah.

02:07:36.214 --> 02:07:37.295
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll take some bone.
LIAM: Xylophone?

02:07:37.295 --> 02:07:39.462
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll take some bone just to have.

02:07:39.462 --> 02:07:40.884
SAM: Some baby bone?

02:07:40.884 --> 02:07:42.786
TALIESIN: You can certainly dry it out now.

02:07:42.786 --> 02:07:43.619
MATT: Yeah.

02:07:43.619 --> 02:07:45.953
SAM: Has its skull fused yet?

02:07:45.953 --> 02:07:47.144
Because it's still a baby.

02:07:47.144 --> 02:07:48.846
LAURA: What? Can we just not?

02:07:48.846 --> 02:07:50.495
LIAM: Wow.

02:07:50.495 --> 02:07:53.006
LAURA: I don't want to actually think of it as a baby, okay?

02:07:53.006 --> 02:07:54.108
SAM: Oh, I'm sorry,

02:07:54.108 --> 02:07:56.398
it just had a baby face, and so...

02:07:56.398 --> 02:07:59.593
LAURA: It also had lots of arms
sticking out of the baby face.

02:07:59.593 --> 02:08:01.302
It was not...
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:08:02.165 --> 02:08:06.004
LAURA: It was not a baby.
MARISHA: And a weird bulb

02:08:06.004 --> 02:08:10.377
that was very entrancing.
SAM: I thought that was the umbilical cord.

02:08:10.377 --> 02:08:11.500
TRAVIS: It could be super old.

02:08:11.500 --> 02:08:14.754
I mean, this city is the beginning of time city.

02:08:14.754 --> 02:08:16.156
It's been here for forever.

02:08:16.156 --> 02:08:17.389
MARISHA: Yeah, but we're in a laboratory.

02:08:17.389 --> 02:08:18.877
TALIESIN: Are there any bits of

02:08:18.877 --> 02:08:23.592
this door that explain why it's being held up or anything

02:08:23.592 --> 02:08:27.357
or this door just comes out of the wall. It's not really--

02:08:27.357 --> 02:08:29.396
MATT: It raises up.

02:08:29.396 --> 02:08:30.229
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:08:30.229 --> 02:08:32.545
MATT: And based on the previous doorways you've encountered,

02:08:32.545 --> 02:08:34.761
it looks like it probably has some sort of heavy chain

02:08:34.761 --> 02:08:38.364
and weighted mechanism that lifts it up into the ceiling.

02:08:38.364 --> 02:08:42.096
And since it raised as the previous one closed,

02:08:42.096 --> 02:08:43.387
you assume that there is some sort of

02:08:43.387 --> 02:08:44.844
weighted connection between the two of them.

02:08:44.844 --> 02:08:45.677
TALIESIN: Boo.
LIAM: Yeah.

02:08:45.677 --> 02:08:47.522
And to be clear,

02:08:47.522 --> 02:08:49.880
these people who existed a long time ago,

02:08:49.880 --> 02:08:54.442
everything that we have read said that they were rivaling,

02:08:54.442 --> 02:08:58.450
if not surpassing, all arcane ability today.

02:08:58.450 --> 02:09:00.282
They had immeasurable power.

02:09:00.282 --> 02:09:02.220
So while it was a long time ago,

02:09:02.220 --> 02:09:03.526
it was not the beginning of time.

02:09:03.526 --> 02:09:06.835
They would have needed much time to have achieved this sort

02:09:06.835 --> 02:09:09.669
of sophistication with their skill.

02:09:13.304 --> 02:09:14.137
LAURA: (nervously) Mm-hmm.

02:09:15.099 --> 02:09:16.989
MARISHA: He's not wrong.

02:09:16.989 --> 02:09:19.622
Do I see any signs of

02:09:20.542 --> 02:09:22.749
dead adventures?

02:09:22.749 --> 02:09:26.008
People that was with... I--

02:09:27.388 --> 02:09:28.221
Iver?

02:09:29.108 --> 02:09:30.466
MATT: Go ahead and make an investigation check,

02:09:30.466 --> 02:09:31.362
if you'd like to.

02:09:31.362 --> 02:09:34.254
MARISHA: Or even when I was in the baby?

02:09:34.254 --> 02:09:36.896
LAURA: Should we cut open its belly
and see if we can find other people?

02:09:36.896 --> 02:09:37.729
LIAM: Hmm.

02:09:38.719 --> 02:09:41.796
MARISHA: Natural 20.
LAURA: Yay!

02:09:41.796 --> 02:09:42.644
MATT: Okay.

02:09:42.644 --> 02:09:43.477
SAM: Wild magic.

02:09:45.074 --> 02:09:46.624
MATT: As part of the short rest as well,

02:09:46.624 --> 02:09:48.638
as Yasha is carving through,

02:09:48.638 --> 02:09:51.032
you together guide some elements to try

02:09:51.032 --> 02:09:54.391
and expose the contents of its belly.

02:09:54.391 --> 02:09:57.012
Its physiology is very odd

02:09:57.012 --> 02:09:58.845
and elements of it don't make sense.

02:09:58.845 --> 02:10:02.989
For one, the stomach only has an inner point.

02:10:02.989 --> 02:10:05.112
There is no real functional digestive tract

02:10:05.112 --> 02:10:05.945
beyond the stomach.

02:10:05.945 --> 02:10:07.249
TRAVIS: There was no ah-noos.

02:10:07.249 --> 02:10:10.104
LIAM: It's like an owl. (vomiting)

02:10:10.104 --> 02:10:12.129
MARISHA: Barfs everything out.

02:10:12.129 --> 02:10:13.275
Okay.
MATT: And within the stomach,

02:10:13.275 --> 02:10:16.962
you do find a scattered,

02:10:16.962 --> 02:10:21.079
digested remnants of some bone

02:10:21.079 --> 02:10:24.253
that still exists, though it is mostly dissolved.

02:10:26.219 --> 02:10:27.884
You can make a medicine check, if you'd like to,

02:10:27.884 --> 02:10:29.159
to see if you can ascertain the nature

02:10:29.159 --> 02:10:30.555
of whatever creature these bones originally came from.

02:10:30.555 --> 02:10:31.397
LAURA: Could I help out with that?

02:10:31.397 --> 02:10:34.389
MARISHA: Yeah, can I have Jester help me

02:10:34.389 --> 02:10:35.523
figure out who these people are?

02:10:35.523 --> 02:10:37.281
MATT: Whoever wants to go ahead and make the check.

02:10:37.281 --> 02:10:38.448
Or you can both make it.

02:10:38.448 --> 02:10:40.281
LAURA: I got good medicine.

02:10:40.281 --> 02:10:44.045
MARISHA: Yeah, with advantage, you go twice.

02:10:44.045 --> 02:10:47.361
Jester. What are these bones from?

02:10:47.361 --> 02:10:48.393
LAURA: 29.

02:10:48.393 --> 02:10:51.112
MATT: 29. These are definitely humanoid bones.

02:10:51.112 --> 02:10:55.695
The rate of dissolution on them says that they have not been

02:10:55.695 --> 02:10:57.678
in the stomach long.

02:10:57.678 --> 02:10:59.011
Probably been a few days.

02:10:59.011 --> 02:10:59.844
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

02:11:01.183 --> 02:11:02.991
MATT: You probably see enough--

02:11:02.991 --> 02:11:06.189
I mean, who knows how much is been gone and just

02:11:06.189 --> 02:11:09.172
these are the remnants of it, but you can see elements

02:11:09.172 --> 02:11:14.172
of bone here that lead to at least two people.

02:11:14.180 --> 02:11:15.832
TRAVIS: A previous party.

02:11:15.832 --> 02:11:17.689
TALIESIN: No undissolved magical weapons.

02:11:18.739 --> 02:11:20.126
MATT: Not within here, no.
TALIESIN: All right.

02:11:20.126 --> 02:11:22.498
MARISHA: Did we get an indication from Iver of

02:11:22.498 --> 02:11:24.190
how many people he came with?

02:11:24.190 --> 02:11:25.023
LAURA: Yes.

02:11:25.867 --> 02:11:27.577
LIAM: It was four or five, I thought he said.

02:11:27.577 --> 02:11:28.615
LAURA: Yeah.

02:11:28.615 --> 02:11:31.150
I can't remember, but he did tell us.

02:11:31.150 --> 02:11:33.338
MARISHA: But Caleb remembers.

02:11:33.338 --> 02:11:35.141
LIAM: I don't remember. I think it was four or five.

02:11:35.141 --> 02:11:36.833
MATT: Yeah, I think it was five.

02:11:36.833 --> 02:11:38.122
LIAM: It was five, definitely.

02:11:38.122 --> 02:11:40.305
I remember everything.

02:11:40.305 --> 02:11:41.305
MARISHA: Roughly...

02:11:42.838 --> 02:11:45.437
five people.

02:11:45.437 --> 02:11:48.044
Okay. All right, well.

02:11:48.044 --> 02:11:49.354
LAURA: A couple are here.

02:11:49.354 --> 02:11:51.615
MARISHA: Bad news for Iver.

02:11:51.615 --> 02:11:53.934
LAURA: There might be a more bad news up ahead.

02:11:53.934 --> 02:11:54.767
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:11:54.767 --> 02:11:58.791
Or maybe an ally.

02:11:58.791 --> 02:12:00.803
LIAM: Maybe.
MARISHA: I am not hopeful.

02:12:00.803 --> 02:12:04.061
LIAM: Is everyone feeling ready?

02:12:04.061 --> 02:12:05.861
LAURA: Yeah. I certainly don't want to

02:12:05.861 --> 02:12:08.940
allow the Tomb Takers to catch up with us, so.

02:12:08.940 --> 02:12:10.023
TALIESIN: Let's move.

02:12:12.681 --> 02:12:14.857
TRAVIS: We move forward.
TALIESIN: Everybody all right?

02:12:14.857 --> 02:12:15.690
SAM: Yep!

02:12:15.690 --> 02:12:17.434
MARISHA: Ye-- Ye-- Yeah.

02:12:17.434 --> 02:12:18.267
TALIESIN: All right.

02:12:20.488 --> 02:12:23.433
LAURA: Are you fully healed, Beau?

02:12:23.433 --> 02:12:25.147
MARISHA: For the most part.

02:12:25.147 --> 02:12:26.744
A few scrapes, but I'm fine.

02:12:26.744 --> 02:12:27.845
LAURA: Okay.

02:12:27.845 --> 02:12:30.167
MATT: Okay. What is the marching order going forward?

02:12:30.167 --> 02:12:33.903
You can stand four in a row in this tunnel, so.

02:12:33.903 --> 02:12:36.947
LIAM: I'll be in the front row, then.

02:12:36.947 --> 02:12:39.246
MATT: All right, who's in the front?

02:12:39.246 --> 02:12:40.350
LAURA: I'll be in the front as well.

02:12:40.350 --> 02:12:41.692
SAM: I guess I should be as well

02:12:41.692 --> 02:12:43.319
in case we see anything trappy.

02:12:43.319 --> 02:12:44.523
MATT: All righty, and who else?

02:12:44.523 --> 02:12:45.931
MARISHA: I'll be in the back row.

02:12:45.931 --> 02:12:47.387
TALIESIN: I'll take the middle. Anywhere in the middle.

02:12:47.387 --> 02:12:48.298
TRAVIS: I'll do back row.

02:12:48.298 --> 02:12:49.419
SAM: I'm trappy.

02:12:49.419 --> 02:12:50.905
MATT: So that'd be Yasha.

02:12:50.905 --> 02:12:52.958
You got to be in the front or the back.
ASHLEY: I'll go front. Yeah.

02:12:52.958 --> 02:12:53.958
MATT: All right.

02:12:55.333 --> 02:12:58.474
So you continue down this extended hallway.

02:12:58.474 --> 02:13:01.591
Further down, you can see heavy dents in the metallic walls,

02:13:01.591 --> 02:13:04.391
points of catastrophic impact

02:13:04.391 --> 02:13:06.199
that caused elements to just bend inward

02:13:06.199 --> 02:13:07.965
and some of the metal to actually split.

02:13:07.965 --> 02:13:12.490
You can see, behind it,
stone and elements of cable

02:13:12.490 --> 02:13:15.570
that also are now severed and crushed.

02:13:16.441 --> 02:13:20.228
The trauma in here shows that there was major impact

02:13:20.228 --> 02:13:23.318
from inside here and also structural damage

02:13:23.318 --> 02:13:24.438
from a heavy impact,

02:13:24.438 --> 02:13:26.952
probably when this piece of the city fell

02:13:26.952 --> 02:13:29.034
to Eiselcross originally.

02:13:30.638 --> 02:13:32.406
About 50, 60 feet down,

02:13:32.406 --> 02:13:35.309
you begin to see the occasional blood smear on the wall.

02:13:35.309 --> 02:13:38.148
Like a hand print that just drags across.

02:13:38.148 --> 02:13:40.497
Another place you see a blood smear across the ground

02:13:40.497 --> 02:13:44.215
that goes on for about 40 feet before vanishing.

02:13:44.215 --> 02:13:46.715
But you see no sign of bodies.

02:13:47.906 --> 02:13:48.739
MARISHA: Oh boy.

02:13:50.646 --> 02:13:54.442
MATT: Continuing on for almost a hundred or so feet,

02:13:54.442 --> 02:13:59.192
the hall opens into a new room of sprawling size

02:14:00.433 --> 02:14:03.124
but in absolute disarray.

02:14:03.124 --> 02:14:06.028
Similar in architecture to the previous laboratory

02:14:06.028 --> 02:14:10.236
that you had your battle with this creature in.

02:14:10.236 --> 02:14:12.928
This room, however, is heavily damaged.

02:14:12.928 --> 02:14:15.308
You can see major sections of
the ceiling that have fallen in

02:14:15.308 --> 02:14:17.528
due to the structural damage and collapse.

02:14:17.528 --> 02:14:19.487
And there are large beams

02:14:19.487 --> 02:14:22.545
and metallic pathways that were once raised,

02:14:22.545 --> 02:14:24.220
have now fallen to the ground and clattered.

02:14:24.220 --> 02:14:27.046
You can see there are stone tables that are crushed

02:14:27.046 --> 02:14:29.894
and there is broken rock and instruments that are bent

02:14:29.894 --> 02:14:32.660
and destroyed and just tossed everywhere.

02:14:32.660 --> 02:14:34.771
With what little bit of light as you progress in here

02:14:34.771 --> 02:14:36.131
and begin to incrementally see,

02:14:36.131 --> 02:14:39.264
you can see there are, to the right and left of you,

02:14:39.264 --> 02:14:41.530
open doors, roughly the size

02:14:41.530 --> 02:14:44.427
of the one that you came through,

02:14:44.427 --> 02:14:47.451
to small enclosed chambers.

02:14:50.697 --> 02:14:51.922
You see two to the right and left.

02:14:51.922 --> 02:14:55.662
And-- do you want to continue forward?

02:14:55.662 --> 02:14:57.665
LIAM: Those are open doorways?

02:14:57.665 --> 02:14:58.602
MATT: They are open, yes.

02:14:58.602 --> 02:15:00.772
LAURA: I am going to-- how many do I have left?

02:15:00.772 --> 02:15:02.127
TALIESIN: Want me to put a light in there?

02:15:02.127 --> 02:15:04.447
LIAM: I'll-- fump. Globule.

02:15:04.447 --> 02:15:07.092
LAURA: And I'm going to cast Locate Object one more time.

02:15:07.092 --> 02:15:08.871
MATT: Okay.

02:15:08.871 --> 02:15:10.114
Continuing forward.

02:15:10.114 --> 02:15:12.173
As the light drifts out, you can see now

02:15:12.173 --> 02:15:14.691
these additional doors, there are a number of them

02:15:14.691 --> 02:15:18.584
and there are varying sizes, but they are enclosed within.

02:15:18.584 --> 02:15:22.162
They are similar to prison cells.

02:15:22.162 --> 02:15:24.511
There is no window or door on the inside.

02:15:24.511 --> 02:15:29.019
They are more like containment units, but they are open.

02:15:29.019 --> 02:15:30.658
LIAM: All of them, okay.

02:15:30.658 --> 02:15:34.504
MATT: You see shards of glass around you and debris.

02:15:34.504 --> 02:15:35.446
And...

02:15:36.895 --> 02:15:39.328
Caduceus, Beauregard, and Caleb,

02:15:39.328 --> 02:15:40.337
with your passive perceptions,

02:15:40.337 --> 02:15:42.696
you also see signs of a deadly confrontation.

02:15:42.696 --> 02:15:45.703
You see melted bones, bloody smears,

02:15:45.703 --> 02:15:47.744
shreds of clothing left behind

02:15:47.744 --> 02:15:49.452
amongst the debris and rubble.

02:15:49.452 --> 02:15:52.490
MARISHA: And you said they looked like jail cells?

02:15:52.490 --> 02:15:53.943
MATT: I mean, it's the best thing you could equate it to.

02:15:53.943 --> 02:15:57.484
Because there was a door,
and there was no other exit from it.

02:15:57.484 --> 02:15:59.153
There is no window or anything.

02:15:59.153 --> 02:16:00.619
MARISHA: Cages.
LAURA: Test subjects.

02:16:00.619 --> 02:16:01.802
MARISHA: Test subjects, yeah.

02:16:01.802 --> 02:16:05.289
LIAM: Is there any writing like
we have encountered previously?

02:16:06.881 --> 02:16:09.655
MATT: Make a perception check.
LIAM: Okay.

02:16:09.655 --> 02:16:12.772
LAURA: Do I have a general ping in my brain?

02:16:12.772 --> 02:16:13.605
MATT: You do.

02:16:13.605 --> 02:16:16.405
It is below and a little ways

02:16:16.405 --> 02:16:19.087
to the right, beneath the chamber.

02:16:19.087 --> 02:16:20.287
MARISHA: (quietly) Below and to the right.

02:16:20.287 --> 02:16:21.262
LIAM: 20.

02:16:21.262 --> 02:16:22.504
MATT: 20, okay.

02:16:23.903 --> 02:16:25.653
A couple things catch your eye.

02:16:25.653 --> 02:16:28.861
One, you see a glimmer of some sort of

02:16:28.861 --> 02:16:33.861
shiny metallic rod that's maybe about 15 feet off from you

02:16:34.061 --> 02:16:35.518
that's partially buried

02:16:35.518 --> 02:16:38.789
and left underneath one of the cracked tables.

02:16:39.806 --> 02:16:44.314
You also see a bit of sky blue colored cloth

02:16:44.314 --> 02:16:47.139
that stands out against the rest of the debris,

02:16:47.139 --> 02:16:49.787
about 20 feet ahead of you.

02:16:49.787 --> 02:16:51.421
You can see it's right next to

02:16:51.421 --> 02:16:53.360
one of the openings to one of those chambers.

02:16:53.360 --> 02:16:56.160
And it looks like a piece of the chamber door

02:16:56.160 --> 02:16:58.413
has fallen over, and you just see a little bit of this

02:16:58.413 --> 02:17:02.072
light blue shawl that is peaking out from underneath it.

02:17:02.072 --> 02:17:03.589
TALIESIN: Is there-- go ahead.

02:17:06.183 --> 02:17:09.495
MATT: You do also see further in the chamber

02:17:09.495 --> 02:17:12.536
large, somewhat green-frosted

02:17:12.536 --> 02:17:14.605
or the remnants of green-frosted

02:17:14.605 --> 02:17:19.605
glass containers that immediately remind you--

02:17:19.738 --> 02:17:22.136
MARISHA: Of Halas?
MATT: -- of Halas and the Folding Halls.

02:17:22.136 --> 02:17:24.398
LIAM: Yeah. Same size thereabouts?

02:17:24.398 --> 02:17:25.956
MATT: Larger.
LIAM: Larger.

02:17:25.956 --> 02:17:28.857
MATT: And broken. The glass is shattered,

02:17:30.777 --> 02:17:34.400
and some of them are tipped over and broken on the ground.

02:17:34.400 --> 02:17:36.119
Towards the back,

02:17:36.119 --> 02:17:37.361
which you do finally see an end

02:17:37.361 --> 02:17:39.358
to the chamber about 120 feet in.

02:17:39.358 --> 02:17:42.745
This is a large massive warehouse-type interior.

02:17:42.745 --> 02:17:47.275
You see two that are still solid, unbroken.

02:17:47.275 --> 02:17:50.325
At this distance, you can't make out much beyond that.

02:17:52.196 --> 02:17:55.357
You can see there is a panel in the center

02:17:55.357 --> 02:17:57.979
of the chamber between these that is not ruined

02:17:57.979 --> 02:17:59.205
that does seem to have some sort of writing,

02:17:59.205 --> 02:18:00.899
but you'd have to get closer and

02:18:00.899 --> 02:18:01.974
through the use of a spell to

02:18:01.974 --> 02:18:03.357
probably read it.
LIAM: Right, yeah.

02:18:05.452 --> 02:18:08.010
First thing to do is read before touching.

02:18:08.010 --> 02:18:10.218
So I will cast Tongues on myself again.

02:18:10.218 --> 02:18:13.379
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: And approach that writing.

02:18:13.379 --> 02:18:14.311
MATT: Okay.

02:18:14.311 --> 02:18:16.174
LAURA: Do we hear any kind of movement in the room?

02:18:16.174 --> 02:18:18.711
Is it silent in here?

02:18:18.711 --> 02:18:19.878
MATT: At the moment, right now,

02:18:19.878 --> 02:18:22.333
if you'd like to make a perception check to listen, you can.

02:18:22.333 --> 02:18:25.933
TALIESIN: I also want to see if those bones

02:18:25.933 --> 02:18:30.028
look like they were acid melted or something else melted.

02:18:30.028 --> 02:18:31.808
MATT: Okay.

02:18:31.808 --> 02:18:34.134
MARISHA: And I'll make my way to the cloth.

02:18:34.134 --> 02:18:35.400
LAURA: 24.

02:18:35.400 --> 02:18:36.952
MATT: 24. Okay.

02:18:36.952 --> 02:18:37.785
TALIESIN: 27.

02:18:37.785 --> 02:18:40.455
MATT: 27. Listening out and keeping your eyes peeled,

02:18:40.455 --> 02:18:42.454
you do not hear any movement.

02:18:42.454 --> 02:18:45.527
It is still, eerily so, in here.

02:18:45.527 --> 02:18:47.209
The only sound you make is the sound

02:18:47.209 --> 02:18:49.794
of crunching debris beneath the boot falls of you

02:18:49.794 --> 02:18:51.475
and your compatriots around you.

02:18:51.475 --> 02:18:53.167
But because the chamber is so large,

02:18:53.167 --> 02:18:54.516
and because there's so much debris in the way,

02:18:54.516 --> 02:18:57.579
what faint bit of an echo there would be is absorbed

02:18:57.579 --> 02:18:59.879
by the surrounding irregularities.

02:19:02.231 --> 02:19:03.598
You were looking towards--?

02:19:03.598 --> 02:19:06.023
TALIESIN: I just wanted-- one of the things I wanted--
MATT: Oh, the bones?

02:19:06.023 --> 02:19:07.698
Make a medicine check for me.

02:19:07.698 --> 02:19:11.040
LIAM: Also, note, I meant Comprehend Language, not Tongues.

02:19:11.040 --> 02:19:12.658
MATT: I assumed that's what you were referring to.

02:19:12.658 --> 02:19:13.491
TALIESIN: 17.

02:19:13.491 --> 02:19:15.464
MATT: 17. The bones you do find

02:19:15.464 --> 02:19:16.671
do appear to be acid dissolved.

02:19:16.671 --> 02:19:17.838
TALIESIN: That's good.

02:19:19.354 --> 02:19:21.081
MATT: You were inspecting the shawl?

02:19:21.081 --> 02:19:23.053
MARISHA: Yes.
MATT: Okay.

02:19:23.053 --> 02:19:25.494
You go towards it and you can see now

02:19:25.494 --> 02:19:28.215
it is stained with blood and torn,

02:19:28.215 --> 02:19:30.051
peeking out from underneath the barrier.

02:19:30.051 --> 02:19:34.459
And from glancing, it looks like there
is a crushed body beneath that piece of metal.

02:19:35.850 --> 02:19:36.957
MARISHA: Recent blood?

02:19:36.957 --> 02:19:40.202
Is it brown and dark or is it fresher?

02:19:40.202 --> 02:19:41.445
MATT: It's-- it's brown.

02:19:41.445 --> 02:19:45.787
It's congealed, but it's not entirely dried.

02:19:45.787 --> 02:19:47.317
It seems a little bit fresher

02:19:47.317 --> 02:19:49.370
than what you'd expect in a place so ancient.

02:19:49.370 --> 02:19:51.619
MARISHA: I just shout out to the rest.

02:19:51.619 --> 02:19:55.611
I think there's a body still here.

02:19:55.611 --> 02:19:57.548
And I move closer towards it.

02:19:57.548 --> 02:19:58.381
MATT: Okay.

02:19:58.381 --> 02:20:01.549
TALIESIN: I'm going to move closer
towards it, too, and detect undead.

02:20:01.549 --> 02:20:03.734
MATT: Okay. You do not detect undead.

02:20:03.734 --> 02:20:05.432
LAURA: I'm going to head over that way as well.

02:20:05.432 --> 02:20:06.265
MATT: Okay.

02:20:06.265 --> 02:20:10.356
You go and you can see that bit of cloth material,

02:20:10.356 --> 02:20:13.531
there was a shoulder and you see a little bit of hair.

02:20:13.531 --> 02:20:15.242
It's still pinned beneath the--

02:20:15.242 --> 02:20:18.044
the metal plate that has fallen on top of it.

02:20:18.044 --> 02:20:21.169
MARISHA: Yasha, help me lift this.

02:20:21.169 --> 02:20:23.693
ASHLEY: Yep. One, two, three.

02:20:23.693 --> 02:20:25.876
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make
a strength check with advantage.

02:20:25.876 --> 02:20:27.684
Or you both can do it.
MARISHA: Advantage.

02:20:27.684 --> 02:20:28.959
MATT: All right, go for it.

02:20:32.873 --> 02:20:33.968
ASHLEY: 28.

02:20:33.968 --> 02:20:34.917
MATT: 28.
TRAVIS: Damn.

02:20:34.917 --> 02:20:37.440
MATT: Easy enough to do. You get up and shift it over.

02:20:37.440 --> 02:20:40.310
You hear the (screeching) as it grinds across the stone.

02:20:40.310 --> 02:20:41.885
(heavy impact)

02:20:41.885 --> 02:20:43.974
And when that hits the ground, it hits with a heavy impact.

02:20:43.974 --> 02:20:47.295
You do feel the (thud)
echo throughout the room a bit.

02:20:47.295 --> 02:20:49.194
A little bit of dust settles

02:20:49.194 --> 02:20:51.153
a bit from the ceiling.
TALIESIN: I'm going to be on high alert.

02:20:51.153 --> 02:20:51.986
MATT: Okay.

02:20:53.052 --> 02:20:57.935
You do see the partially crushed corpse of a woman,

02:20:57.935 --> 02:21:02.935
wearing fine studded leather gear, half-elven, and the rest

02:21:03.009 --> 02:21:04.901
of the shawl that you see that is torn

02:21:04.901 --> 02:21:06.693
and bloodied from part of the torso,

02:21:06.693 --> 02:21:09.965
you can see that it's just gashed open.

02:21:09.965 --> 02:21:12.157
Does bear the mark of the Cerberus Assembly

02:21:12.157 --> 02:21:14.027
across the lapel.
MARISHA: Shit.

02:21:14.027 --> 02:21:15.614
TALIESIN: Get that rod, too, while we're here.

02:21:15.614 --> 02:21:19.045
MARISHA: Cerberus Assembly.
LIAM: It's the annex.

02:21:19.045 --> 02:21:20.250
TRAVIS: The annex?

02:21:20.250 --> 02:21:23.857
SAM: It's the--
LIAM: -- the assistant, Zana.

02:21:23.857 --> 02:21:25.765
LAURA: Ludinus'--
MARISHA: Oh, this is Zana.

02:21:27.313 --> 02:21:28.558
LAURA: Can I search her?

02:21:28.558 --> 02:21:31.449
SAM: Search her for a wallet--
MARISHA: Letters.

02:21:31.449 --> 02:21:32.499
SAM: ID.

02:21:32.499 --> 02:21:33.857
MATT: Sure, make an investigation check.

02:21:33.857 --> 02:21:34.856
SAM: Student ID.

02:21:34.856 --> 02:21:38.229
LAURA: Investigation, I guess I should-- should I do this?

02:21:38.229 --> 02:21:40.646
Or should I make Beau search her?

02:21:40.646 --> 02:21:42.179
MARISHA: Is it perception or investigation?

02:21:42.179 --> 02:21:44.679
LAURA: Investigation?
SAM: I mean, I can do it.

02:21:45.686 --> 02:21:47.069
LAURA: I mean, I said I was going to do it, but.

02:21:47.069 --> 02:21:48.344
MATT: Yeah, go ahead and make a roll.

02:21:48.344 --> 02:21:49.981
You can both do it.

02:21:49.981 --> 02:21:51.103
SAM: You go.

02:21:51.103 --> 02:21:53.519
LAURA: No, I have terrible investigation.
SAM: You're an expert detective!

02:21:53.519 --> 02:21:54.711
Here, take my magnifying glass.

02:21:54.711 --> 02:21:55.952
LAURA: Oh, thank you.

02:21:55.952 --> 02:21:58.185
MATT: (laughs)

02:21:59.714 --> 02:22:01.525
LAURA: I didn't even Guide myself.

02:22:02.583 --> 02:22:05.728
MATT: To be fair, the other hand was a little occupied.

02:22:05.728 --> 02:22:06.753
LAURA: 15.

02:22:06.753 --> 02:22:10.023
MATT: 15. Okay. Looking through,

02:22:10.023 --> 02:22:12.548
you do not see any coins, per se.

02:22:12.548 --> 02:22:15.318
There is a small shortsword that is sheathed.

02:22:15.318 --> 02:22:17.777
It doesn't look like it gets a lot of use.

02:22:18.660 --> 02:22:20.168
You do not see any other weapon,

02:22:20.168 --> 02:22:23.068
though there is a sheath for what looks to be...

02:22:25.335 --> 02:22:27.935
almost like a rapier or a long thin weapon

02:22:27.935 --> 02:22:29.903
on the other hip.

02:22:29.903 --> 02:22:34.734
This individual is wearing fine leather armor.

02:22:34.734 --> 02:22:36.918
For the state of the rest of the body,

02:22:36.918 --> 02:22:40.478
especially given some of the recent encounters you had,

02:22:40.478 --> 02:22:45.320
and the the damage that the
physical torso and head has sustained,

02:22:45.320 --> 02:22:47.995
the armor is fairly impeccably kept.

02:22:49.235 --> 02:22:51.570
MARISHA: Any documents? Any notes?

02:22:51.570 --> 02:22:56.189
LAURA: Not that I could find,
but she's got some really cool armor.

02:22:56.189 --> 02:22:57.854
MARISHA: Did you check her cleavage pocket?

02:22:57.854 --> 02:22:59.109
There's always a cleavage pocket.

02:22:59.109 --> 02:23:03.411
Can I check and see if I find any paper?

02:23:03.411 --> 02:23:04.643
Is that different enough?

02:23:04.643 --> 02:23:07.221
MATT: Sure. You reach through the front of

02:23:07.221 --> 02:23:09.611
the chest plate to where the cleavage would be and your hand

02:23:09.611 --> 02:23:11.695
finds an open cavity.

02:23:11.695 --> 02:23:12.669
MARISHA: Haaaaah.

02:23:12.669 --> 02:23:14.508
I just pull it back, a little freaked out.

02:23:14.508 --> 02:23:16.256
MATT: Your fingers find-- (squishing)

02:23:16.256 --> 02:23:19.381
and you pull out and your hand
is just covered in coagulated blood.

02:23:19.381 --> 02:23:21.679
MARISHA: Gross, gross, gross, gross.

02:23:21.679 --> 02:23:22.512
I walk away.

02:23:22.512 --> 02:23:23.879
SAM: Wipe it on something, wipe it on on the wall.

02:23:23.879 --> 02:23:25.879
MARISHA: I wipe it on Caduceus.

02:23:28.721 --> 02:23:30.922
LAURA: I'm going to start searching
around for that other weapon.

02:23:30.922 --> 02:23:32.854
I'll say, she had another weapon.

02:23:32.854 --> 02:23:34.395
It was a long skinny--

02:23:34.395 --> 02:23:35.529
SAM: I'm going to take off the armor.

02:23:35.529 --> 02:23:37.344
LIAM: It was a rod.

02:23:37.344 --> 02:23:38.543
LAURA: It was a rod?

02:23:38.543 --> 02:23:39.551
LIAM: Oh, you're talking about that,

02:23:39.551 --> 02:23:41.629
but the DM also mentioned a rod poking out.

02:23:41.629 --> 02:23:44.070
LAURA: Obviously it was a rod, but I don't know that.

02:23:44.070 --> 02:23:45.820
But Caleb, you would.

02:23:47.229 --> 02:23:48.597
LIAM: I called out everything.

02:23:48.597 --> 02:23:51.154
MATT: Right.
LAURA: Oh, there was a rod!

02:23:51.154 --> 02:23:51.987
MATT: Sure.

02:23:51.987 --> 02:23:55.576
LIAM: No, I'm at the panel you were talking about.

02:23:55.576 --> 02:23:57.743
MATT: Gotcha. So at the panel.

02:23:59.448 --> 02:24:02.730
The phrasing there

02:24:02.730 --> 02:24:06.280
essentially translates to "Hunter Development List."

02:24:08.104 --> 02:24:10.190
MARISHA: Hunter Development List.

02:24:10.190 --> 02:24:13.189
MATT: And the bottom portion of it is missing.

02:24:13.189 --> 02:24:16.830
It looks like it has sustained some damage and some

02:24:16.830 --> 02:24:18.988
of the stonework is cracked and removed from it.

02:24:18.988 --> 02:24:22.924
But what you do see beneath that,
you see a phrase that says,

02:24:22.924 --> 02:24:26.332
Absorber: 0-072.

02:24:28.730 --> 02:24:31.055
MARISHA: Zero dash zero seven two?

02:24:31.055 --> 02:24:32.094
MATT: Correct.

02:24:32.094 --> 02:24:33.271
MARISHA: Absorber.

02:24:33.271 --> 02:24:37.354
MATT: Beneath that you see: Nullifier 0-038.

02:24:38.527 --> 02:24:39.585
LIAM: Don't like this.

02:24:39.585 --> 02:24:42.039
MARISHA: Nullifier.
LAURA: Yeah, no, this sucks.

02:24:42.039 --> 02:24:43.830
This is stuff that fucks up magic.

02:24:43.830 --> 02:24:46.606
LIAM: We just killed the absorber.
TRAVIS: Keep going.

02:24:46.606 --> 02:24:48.458
MATT: "Subject" is the next one.

02:24:48.458 --> 02:24:51.491
0-002.

02:24:51.491 --> 02:24:52.940
LAURA: Ooh.
MARISHA: -- dash zero zero two.

02:24:52.940 --> 02:24:54.071
LAURA: That's an early one.

02:24:54.071 --> 02:24:55.597
MARISHA: Yeah it is. Subject--

02:24:55.597 --> 02:24:58.223
MATT: And that's all that remains on that panel.

02:24:58.223 --> 02:25:00.060
LIAM: Okay, and are those words

02:25:00.060 --> 02:25:03.273
by buttons of any kind or they're just--

02:25:03.273 --> 02:25:05.141
LAURA: Ooh, I bet those are the other doors.

02:25:05.141 --> 02:25:07.882
ASHLEY: Are there any numbers on top of the

02:25:07.882 --> 02:25:09.375
doors and things like that?

02:25:09.375 --> 02:25:10.208
MATT: What was that? I'm sorry.

02:25:10.208 --> 02:25:12.407
ASHLEY: Any numbers on top of the doors

02:25:12.407 --> 02:25:13.933
or archways or something like that?

02:25:13.933 --> 02:25:14.766
MATT: Going and keeping an eye out,

02:25:14.766 --> 02:25:18.434
you do not see any numbers marking the doors, no.

02:25:18.434 --> 02:25:20.250
SAM: How's that armor look?

02:25:20.250 --> 02:25:23.141
Can I get it off that body?

02:25:23.141 --> 02:25:24.432
MATT: Yeah. You can get off that body.

02:25:24.432 --> 02:25:25.301
It'll take you a little bit,

02:25:25.301 --> 02:25:28.126
and it's not going to be the cleanest armor.

02:25:28.126 --> 02:25:30.490
It definitely smells of decay.

02:25:30.490 --> 02:25:32.165
SAM: I'll work on it.
MATT: All right.

02:25:33.282 --> 02:25:35.606
LAURA: I'm going to search for
that rod that Caleb pointed out.

02:25:35.606 --> 02:25:37.622
So I'm going to go to
that rod that Caleb pointed out.

02:25:37.622 --> 02:25:38.881
MATT: Okay.

02:25:38.881 --> 02:25:40.242
You pull it free.

02:25:40.242 --> 02:25:43.882
And it is a solid platinum

02:25:43.882 --> 02:25:45.552
thin, almost like a cane,

02:25:45.552 --> 02:25:47.035
like a walking cane,

02:25:47.877 --> 02:25:50.568
that has interesting

02:25:50.568 --> 02:25:52.390
cap engravings in the top and bottom,

02:25:52.390 --> 02:25:54.622
but it seems just solid and simple,

02:25:54.622 --> 02:25:58.091
but also very beautiful in its simplicity.

02:25:58.091 --> 02:25:59.211
It's lightweight.

02:25:59.211 --> 02:26:01.144
And it looks to me made of platinum.

02:26:01.144 --> 02:26:02.677
LAURA: Ooh!

02:26:02.677 --> 02:26:04.927
I'll do a little song and dance with it.

02:26:04.927 --> 02:26:06.751
SAM: It could be magic.
LAURA: I bet it is!

02:26:06.751 --> 02:26:08.151
SAM: Do something like a--

02:26:08.151 --> 02:26:10.168
LAURA: No, I don't want to accidentally

02:26:10.168 --> 02:26:13.624
cast something with this. It could be super dangerous.

02:26:13.624 --> 02:26:15.789
LIAM: I cast Detect Magic.

02:26:15.789 --> 02:26:19.842
MATT: Okay. The rod that she is carrying is indeed magical.

02:26:19.842 --> 02:26:22.804
As well as the armor that you are removing from the body.

02:26:22.804 --> 02:26:25.529
LAURA: Oh, grab the little strap to tie it to your waist.

02:26:25.529 --> 02:26:27.389
She has a harness for this thing.

02:26:27.389 --> 02:26:29.891
MATT: You also sense strong magical essences coming

02:26:29.891 --> 02:26:34.891
from the two unbroken glass containers

02:26:35.123 --> 02:26:37.821
on the far side of the chamber.

02:26:37.821 --> 02:26:39.385
MARISHA: Yeah. Can I make my way--

02:26:39.385 --> 02:26:41.453
♪ make my way ♪ to the test tubes? ♪

02:26:41.453 --> 02:26:43.023
MATT: Sure.
MARISHA: Thank you.

02:26:43.023 --> 02:26:44.248
SAM: (piano from "A Thousand Miles")

02:26:44.248 --> 02:26:47.242
TRAVIS: Were those test tubes long
enough to hold said elephant baby?

02:26:47.242 --> 02:26:48.799
MATT: Not quite that large, no.

02:26:48.799 --> 02:26:52.869
But both of them look to be between 12, 13 feet tall

02:26:52.869 --> 02:26:56.047
and about say eight, nine feet wide.

02:26:56.047 --> 02:26:57.555
TRAVIS: Cool, yep. Great.

02:26:57.555 --> 02:26:58.655
Great, yep.

02:26:59.892 --> 02:27:01.233
Gotta take attendance sometime here.

02:27:01.233 --> 02:27:04.112
MATT: As you both approach, and the
light helps you clarify the details.

02:27:04.112 --> 02:27:05.570
You can see the interior of the glass,

02:27:05.570 --> 02:27:08.933
much like the shattered ones around, definitely dirty.

02:27:08.933 --> 02:27:13.706
You can see there is old, long built up

02:27:13.706 --> 02:27:15.432
whether it be bacteria or some sort

02:27:15.432 --> 02:27:17.775
of fungus or just dirt has gathered

02:27:17.775 --> 02:27:20.783
in splotches on the inside of the glass.

02:27:22.338 --> 02:27:26.155
But you also see shapes of something within,

02:27:26.155 --> 02:27:28.121
and it appears to be liquid-filled.

02:27:29.046 --> 02:27:31.605
And as you get close,

02:27:31.605 --> 02:27:33.054
you see within one glass tube,

02:27:33.054 --> 02:27:36.254
the one that's to the left of where you're facing,

02:27:36.254 --> 02:27:39.339
a vaguely humanoid bipedal body

02:27:39.339 --> 02:27:42.282
of a dark yellow jaundiced color,

02:27:42.282 --> 02:27:44.599
standing-- or would be standing if it were standing,

02:27:44.599 --> 02:27:46.179
about 10 feet tall.

02:27:46.179 --> 02:27:49.505
But it is currently hunched
and just elevated within the tube.

02:27:49.505 --> 02:27:51.390
Its elongated arms,

02:27:51.390 --> 02:27:53.906
and then these massive clawed hands,

02:27:53.906 --> 02:27:57.403
while a terrifying serpent head sits on its shoulders.

02:27:57.403 --> 02:28:00.231
Its eyes are closed in some kind of torpor.

02:28:00.231 --> 02:28:03.914
Its torso, you can see, seems to bear

02:28:03.914 --> 02:28:06.714
nearly a dozen odd slits, like horizontal gills

02:28:06.714 --> 02:28:09.455
across it, and in an odd pattern.

02:28:10.340 --> 02:28:12.413
And as you look over it, you swear you see one

02:28:12.413 --> 02:28:15.888
of these slits twitch faintly.

02:28:17.829 --> 02:28:19.914
To the right, you see another tube.

02:28:19.914 --> 02:28:21.139
And within this one,

02:28:21.139 --> 02:28:24.544
it holds a quadrupedal panther-like creature,

02:28:24.544 --> 02:28:27.511
nearly the size of a horse that is curled up

02:28:27.511 --> 02:28:30.195
on itself and just drifting and leaning

02:28:30.195 --> 02:28:32.224
against one side of it.

02:28:32.224 --> 02:28:33.832
You can see it has these heavy claws,

02:28:33.832 --> 02:28:36.072
though they're currently not extended,

02:28:36.072 --> 02:28:38.843
and a weirdly colorful patterned body

02:28:38.843 --> 02:28:41.096
that has elements of maroon and teal.

02:28:41.096 --> 02:28:45.613
It's weirdly unexpectedly colorful.

02:28:45.613 --> 02:28:48.610
And you can see where it rests suspended.

02:28:48.610 --> 02:28:52.543
It has a thick fleshy stalk of a tail that seems to emerge

02:28:52.543 --> 02:28:55.999
from the base of its pelvis and it curves underneath it.

02:28:55.999 --> 02:28:59.274
And at the end of it you see an eyeball about this large,

02:28:59.274 --> 02:29:00.990
lidless, within there.

02:29:00.990 --> 02:29:02.036
And as soon as you see it,

02:29:02.036 --> 02:29:03.597
(squelching) it looks towards you.

02:29:03.597 --> 02:29:06.959
MARISHA: Oh my god.
LAURA: They're like awake, they're awake?!

02:29:06.959 --> 02:29:09.146
TRAVIS: Underneath the pelvis? Or on the tail?

02:29:09.146 --> 02:29:10.746
MATT: At the end of the tail.
TRAVIS: Oh god.

02:29:10.746 --> 02:29:12.479
LIAM: Is there any labeling, numbering--

02:29:12.479 --> 02:29:14.712
LAURA: An eyeball on the tail?!
LIAM: -- or anything on their vat or anything?

02:29:14.712 --> 02:29:16.395
TRAVIS: And it has a head, right?

02:29:16.395 --> 02:29:20.097
MATT: You approach and look down, and at the base of the--

02:29:23.288 --> 02:29:25.113
at the base of the one that

02:29:25.113 --> 02:29:27.479
has the eye at the end of the tail--

02:29:27.479 --> 02:29:29.195
let me double check on this one, actually.

02:29:29.195 --> 02:29:30.028
LAURA: Oh no.

02:29:30.028 --> 02:29:32.857
LIAM: One of these the subject and one the nullifier?
MARISHA: The nullifier?

02:29:32.857 --> 02:29:34.732
We have absorber, nullifier, subject.

02:29:34.732 --> 02:29:36.881
LIAM: You were just absorbed in that last chamber.

02:29:36.881 --> 02:29:38.903
I'm wondering if that was the absorber.

02:29:38.903 --> 02:29:40.783
LAURA: That could be the subject.

02:29:40.783 --> 02:29:43.849
TRAVIS: If it's displacer-based, it could be.

02:29:44.974 --> 02:29:46.596
LIAM: Who knows.
MARISHA: Who knows.

02:29:46.596 --> 02:29:48.987
MATT: Okay. Yes. So the--

02:29:50.062 --> 02:29:51.687
LAURA: Please don't break out.

02:29:51.687 --> 02:29:54.398
MATT: The panther-like creature underneath the glass,

02:29:54.398 --> 02:29:56.230
you could see while your spell is still on there,

02:29:56.230 --> 02:29:59.355
it reads, "Absorber."

02:29:59.355 --> 02:30:01.766
There isn't a number; it just says "Absorber."
LIAM: Okay.

02:30:01.766 --> 02:30:03.866
MATT: The one that has the serpent head

02:30:03.866 --> 02:30:06.607
and the elongated arms,

02:30:06.607 --> 02:30:08.579
it says, "Nullifier."

02:30:08.579 --> 02:30:11.388
MARISHA: So, okay.

02:30:11.388 --> 02:30:14.892
TALIESIN: Let's just keep walking very quietly.

02:30:14.892 --> 02:30:16.601
MATT: As you are this far in the chamber,

02:30:16.601 --> 02:30:21.115
you do see the end of it, as the far wall, it comes

02:30:21.115 --> 02:30:22.252
to an end.

02:30:22.252 --> 02:30:26.926
You can see there is a heavy crumbled mass

02:30:26.926 --> 02:30:31.353
of failed structure that has just fallen in

02:30:31.353 --> 02:30:34.185
and blocked any further access.

02:30:34.185 --> 02:30:35.460
From when you glanced around,

02:30:35.460 --> 02:30:36.884
you haven't noticed any sort of

02:30:36.884 --> 02:30:40.384
other exit doors prominently displayed.

02:30:44.523 --> 02:30:47.604
LAURA: I don't like this room, you guys.

02:30:47.604 --> 02:30:48.887
SAM: Nope.

02:30:48.887 --> 02:30:49.862
MARISHA: Me neither.

02:30:49.862 --> 02:30:53.328
TALIESIN: There's been no floor grates, no--?

02:30:53.328 --> 02:30:54.369
MARISHA: Ways down?

02:30:54.369 --> 02:30:55.828
MATT: If you want to go ahead and take a look,

02:30:55.828 --> 02:30:57.828
roll a perception check.

02:31:01.507 --> 02:31:02.663
TALIESIN: 30.

02:31:02.663 --> 02:31:04.444
MATT: 30.
TALIESIN: Good roll.

02:31:04.444 --> 02:31:06.309
MATT: You do not see any floor grates,

02:31:06.309 --> 02:31:07.974
and as they're having these conversations

02:31:07.974 --> 02:31:09.875
and glancing about and futzing with armor,

02:31:09.875 --> 02:31:13.787
you begin to do the Caduceus scan of the environment.

02:31:13.787 --> 02:31:16.619
As tall as you are, and seeing what's around there,

02:31:16.619 --> 02:31:18.168
you begin to crouch low

02:31:18.168 --> 02:31:20.986
and glance beneath some of these fallen tables.

02:31:22.019 --> 02:31:24.352
What you do eventually find,

02:31:25.737 --> 02:31:27.449
near the far right end

02:31:27.449 --> 02:31:30.257
of where the heavy structural damage is,

02:31:30.257 --> 02:31:33.590
you see underneath one of the stone tables

02:31:33.590 --> 02:31:36.832
that is partially lifted to one side,

02:31:36.832 --> 02:31:38.958
an opening in the wall

02:31:38.958 --> 02:31:42.934
about two feet by two and a half feet,

02:31:42.934 --> 02:31:47.251
very tight, but it seems to be an angled tunnel.

02:31:49.277 --> 02:31:51.844
It's large enough for a singular person to--

02:31:51.844 --> 02:31:53.444
of your largest sizes--

02:31:53.444 --> 02:31:55.926
uncomfortably fit through, but fit through.

02:31:55.926 --> 02:31:56.759
LIAM: Veth?

02:31:57.976 --> 02:32:01.971
SAM: Is that the direction that you felt the object?

02:32:01.971 --> 02:32:04.532
LAURA: Head down and to the right.
Is it in the right direction?

02:32:04.532 --> 02:32:05.840
MATT: It seems to be angling in a

02:32:05.840 --> 02:32:07.324
somewhat similar direction.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

02:32:07.324 --> 02:32:09.586
That's where we should go.

02:32:09.586 --> 02:32:11.471
LIAM: Well, let me finish what I'm doing here.

02:32:11.471 --> 02:32:12.695
You handed this to me.

02:32:12.695 --> 02:32:15.292
While Caduceus scanned the room,

02:32:15.292 --> 02:32:18.635
I started in on Identify for this rod.

02:32:18.635 --> 02:32:21.067
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: So if we can wait another six or seven minutes.

02:32:21.067 --> 02:32:23.914
TALIESIN: I think we can maybe start sending people

02:32:23.914 --> 02:32:26.634
through, since it's going to be--
LAURA: No no no. Oh, I mean--

02:32:26.634 --> 02:32:27.692
TRAVIS: We just don't know if it'll slide

02:32:27.692 --> 02:32:28.673
and then that'll be it.

02:32:28.673 --> 02:32:30.740
TALIESIN: Fair, fair.
SAM: I'll go.

02:32:30.740 --> 02:32:32.980
MARISHA: You still have my goggles, yeah?

02:32:32.980 --> 02:32:34.084
SAM: Yep, sure do.

02:32:34.084 --> 02:32:37.300
MARISHA: If you lose those, I'll break your pinky.

02:32:37.300 --> 02:32:40.065
LAURA: I'm going to Guidance you before you head in there.

02:32:40.065 --> 02:32:41.840
Just so you get a, you know,

02:32:41.840 --> 02:32:43.891
a little help on something.
SAM: Thank you.

02:32:43.891 --> 02:32:46.173
TRAVIS: Do you want a rope in case you need to be pulled up?

02:32:46.173 --> 02:32:48.613
SAM: Yes, definitely.

02:32:48.613 --> 02:32:50.410
TRAVIS: Great, who's got rope?

02:32:50.410 --> 02:32:54.306
LAURA: Oh yeah, we should talk quietly. Wait, the tubes.

02:32:54.306 --> 02:32:57.072
TRAVIS: (whispering) Yeah, here's 50 feet of rope.

02:32:57.072 --> 02:32:59.164
ASHLEY: (whispering) Okay.
MARISHA: (whispering) Why are we whispering?

02:32:59.164 --> 02:33:01.001
LAURA: Because of the tubes!

02:33:01.001 --> 02:33:02.129
MARISHA: Oh.

02:33:02.129 --> 02:33:04.063
TALIESIN: It twitches weird, I want to notice.

02:33:04.063 --> 02:33:05.232
MARISHA: I think I still have rope.

02:33:05.232 --> 02:33:07.107
TRAVIS: By the way, do we see any sort of

02:33:07.107 --> 02:33:11.972
flush or not flush buttons that were in the previous room?

02:33:11.972 --> 02:33:13.490
MATT: Glancing around here,

02:33:13.490 --> 02:33:16.149
you see things that might've held a similar structure,

02:33:16.149 --> 02:33:18.429
but have since been shattered.

02:33:18.429 --> 02:33:22.537
This isn't some extremely button covered panel room.

02:33:22.537 --> 02:33:25.141
Everything here is generally much more reserved and

02:33:25.141 --> 02:33:27.512
deliberately placed in smaller spaces.

02:33:27.512 --> 02:33:29.033
At least from what you can gather

02:33:29.033 --> 02:33:31.775
of this strange Aeorian layout.

02:33:31.775 --> 02:33:34.511
But you see a couple of platforms that probably

02:33:34.511 --> 02:33:37.829
served a similar purpose, but they have been wrecked.

02:33:37.829 --> 02:33:40.060
LAURA: Does this room seem like this was

02:33:40.060 --> 02:33:42.382
the hangout place for giant baby elephant?

02:33:42.382 --> 02:33:45.883
And it's just ravaged the room because of it?

02:33:45.883 --> 02:33:46.842
MATT: It kind of does.

02:33:46.842 --> 02:33:47.675
LAURA: Okay.

02:33:47.675 --> 02:33:49.482
MATT: You can see some of the side chambers that are open

02:33:49.482 --> 02:33:51.940
those cell-like chambers would be large enough to

02:33:51.940 --> 02:33:53.708
carry a creature like this.

02:33:53.708 --> 02:33:55.311
TRAVIS: Just so we're acknowledging it, right,

02:33:55.311 --> 02:33:58.055
if we move forward and if someone does happen to catch up

02:33:58.055 --> 02:33:59.943
to us at this point, we will be ahead,

02:33:59.943 --> 02:34:02.020
and they could, in theory, take these two things

02:34:02.020 --> 02:34:04.537
out of the cages and send them after us.

02:34:04.537 --> 02:34:07.300
We don't think there's anything worth doing

02:34:07.300 --> 02:34:09.185
to them while they're in there?

02:34:09.185 --> 02:34:12.138
SAM: Could we open the cages and convince them to be

02:34:12.138 --> 02:34:14.638
on our side with some sort of magic?

02:34:14.638 --> 02:34:15.471
MARISHA: (laughs) Yeah.

02:34:15.471 --> 02:34:17.985
LAURA: Could we just ignore them and hope that's--

02:34:17.985 --> 02:34:21.092
TRAVIS: We could tell them to run the other way.

02:34:21.092 --> 02:34:23.148
LAURA: If they're anything like giant baby,

02:34:23.148 --> 02:34:24.957
I don't think they can be reasoned with.

02:34:24.957 --> 02:34:26.565
TALIESIN: I think this is exactly the sort of thing

02:34:26.565 --> 02:34:28.431
we shouldn't touch.
SAM: Fjord is very persuasive,

02:34:28.431 --> 02:34:29.714
Could you have any magic

02:34:29.714 --> 02:34:31.524
that could control or command them?

02:34:31.524 --> 02:34:32.956
TRAVIS: Yeah, in theory.

02:34:32.956 --> 02:34:35.422
LIAM: Just as an idea, as I'm tracing circles

02:34:35.422 --> 02:34:37.347
around this rod,

02:34:37.347 --> 02:34:41.255
could we maybe all go into that little tunnel

02:34:41.255 --> 02:34:42.804
and break them out

02:34:42.804 --> 02:34:45.336
and seal this passage after us

02:34:45.336 --> 02:34:47.868
so that they are left for anyone coming behind us?

02:34:47.868 --> 02:34:50.260
SAM: Smart thinking.
LAURA: Sure, but then how will we get out?

02:34:51.290 --> 02:34:53.535
LIAM: Can you shift stone around

02:34:53.535 --> 02:34:55.183
like you've done before?

02:34:55.183 --> 02:34:56.841
LAURA: I mean--

02:34:56.841 --> 02:34:58.178
LIAM: You shifted in the way,

02:34:58.178 --> 02:34:59.663
could you shift it out of the way?

02:34:59.663 --> 02:35:01.013
LAURA: Well, sure. But then we'd have to

02:35:01.013 --> 02:35:02.738
fight them when we come back out.

02:35:05.093 --> 02:35:06.749
TALIESIN: I think better just to leave them alone.

02:35:06.749 --> 02:35:07.982
LAURA: I think we leave them.

02:35:07.982 --> 02:35:11.224
I think whoever it is that releases them in the future,

02:35:12.091 --> 02:35:14.128
they'll probably have to fight them, too.

02:35:14.128 --> 02:35:17.896
TALIESIN: I'll leave something for whoever comes next.

02:35:17.896 --> 02:35:19.794
LIAM: I can also leave a wire up,

02:35:19.794 --> 02:35:22.219
to let us know if anything follows.
SAM: Wait.

02:35:23.460 --> 02:35:25.612
You don't have--

02:35:25.612 --> 02:35:27.826
at some point, one of us had some sort

02:35:27.826 --> 02:35:30.540
of glyph that we could put on something.

02:35:30.540 --> 02:35:33.092
TRAVIS: Oh, what about the Intuit?

02:35:33.092 --> 02:35:35.628
TALIESIN: Yeah. I have Guardian of Faith.

02:35:35.628 --> 02:35:37.074
TRAVIS: That's lit.
LIAM: We haven't discussed that.

02:35:37.074 --> 02:35:38.532
That's a lot.

02:35:38.532 --> 02:35:40.262
That is a lot.

02:35:40.262 --> 02:35:41.463
SAM: It's a big bomb, right?

02:35:41.463 --> 02:35:43.929
TRAVIS: Well, kind of.

02:35:45.056 --> 02:35:46.714
It is a bit of a Bouncing Betty,

02:35:46.714 --> 02:35:48.606
but it's not like a bomb.

02:35:48.606 --> 02:35:50.553
LAURA: Oh, I don't have the glyph prepared today.

02:35:50.553 --> 02:35:53.086
TRAVIS: It's like a pause button.

02:35:53.086 --> 02:35:54.312
SAM: A pause button?

02:35:54.312 --> 02:35:58.170
TRAVIS: It's like a 300 foot, (boom), everything stops.

02:35:58.170 --> 02:35:59.385
TALIESIN: It's like an EMP.
SAM: Stops?

02:35:59.385 --> 02:36:00.381
LIAM: Are we talking about the same thing?

02:36:00.381 --> 02:36:01.214
TRAVIS: I think so.

02:36:01.214 --> 02:36:02.995
LIAM: I'm talking about the thing that we just found

02:36:02.995 --> 02:36:04.495
in this structure.
TRAVIS: With the triangles.

02:36:07.692 --> 02:36:09.687
LIAM: It releases

02:36:09.687 --> 02:36:11.544
a massive wave of psychic damage

02:36:11.544 --> 02:36:15.493
against anyone in a massive amount of space.

02:36:15.493 --> 02:36:17.668
You could hit an army with this thing

02:36:17.668 --> 02:36:19.553
TALIESIN: Including any of us as well.

02:36:19.553 --> 02:36:21.696
TRAVIS: And it stuns them as well.

02:36:21.696 --> 02:36:23.555
TALIESIN: I can leave a Guardian of Faith.

02:36:23.555 --> 02:36:25.218
SAM: Well, we can't leave anything that, like,

02:36:25.218 --> 02:36:26.100
if someone walks in the room

02:36:26.100 --> 02:36:29.070
it would explode the cages and release these things.

02:36:29.070 --> 02:36:31.414
Because we don't have that glyph thing, right?

02:36:31.414 --> 02:36:32.568
LAURA: No, sorry.

02:36:32.568 --> 02:36:36.127
SAM: I could rig something with some engineering know-how

02:36:36.127 --> 02:36:39.964
and a little bit of spunk.

02:36:39.964 --> 02:36:41.896
TALIESIN: I could just leave a thing that takes

02:36:41.896 --> 02:36:43.988
about a minute to put there and we could keep moving.

02:36:43.988 --> 02:36:44.921
SAM: Okay.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

02:36:44.921 --> 02:36:47.675
MATT: (laughs)

02:36:47.675 --> 02:36:49.095
Or that. Sure, we'll go with that.

02:36:49.095 --> 02:36:51.576
TALIESIN: I can make something in six seconds.

02:36:51.576 --> 02:36:53.026
LAURA: Oh yeah. Let's do that.

02:36:54.057 --> 02:36:56.977
We can also hide this little tunnel,

02:36:56.977 --> 02:36:58.774
so that anybody coming into this room

02:36:58.774 --> 02:37:01.774
won't be able to find it right away.

02:37:03.554 --> 02:37:05.320
SAM: Great.
LAURA: With a table or something.

02:37:05.320 --> 02:37:06.486
TRAVIS: And before we go, we're waiting on

02:37:06.486 --> 02:37:07.927
the rod in the armor, right?

02:37:07.927 --> 02:37:08.760
LAURA: Yeah.

02:37:08.760 --> 02:37:10.982
SAM: If you want, you can start sending me down now.

02:37:10.982 --> 02:37:13.156
LIAM: The way this thing works is that we could leave it

02:37:13.156 --> 02:37:15.133
behind and--
LAURA: The rod?

02:37:15.133 --> 02:37:18.133
LIAM: No, I don't know what that does.

02:37:18.133 --> 02:37:19.354
I have been casting a spell.

02:37:19.354 --> 02:37:20.595
I can't say this.

02:37:20.595 --> 02:37:23.166
MATT: Yeah, you're concentrating.
So you're casting Identify?

02:37:23.166 --> 02:37:25.221
LIAM: Identify, yeah.

02:37:25.221 --> 02:37:26.824
MATT: On which one, the rod?
LIAM: The rod.

02:37:26.824 --> 02:37:31.439
MATT: The rod, it acts the same as a Wand of Fear does,

02:37:31.439 --> 02:37:35.391
but it has been enchanted into a rod-type object.

02:37:35.391 --> 02:37:36.962
So if you look up a Wand of Fear--

02:37:36.962 --> 02:37:37.995
LIAM: So it's a Rod of Fear.

02:37:37.995 --> 02:37:39.962
MATT: Yeah. Rod of Fear.

02:37:39.962 --> 02:37:42.146
LAURA: What's the difference between a wand and a rod?

02:37:42.146 --> 02:37:45.472
MATT: A wand is smaller and can be used as an implement.

02:37:45.472 --> 02:37:46.521
You can use a rod, too, as well.

02:37:46.521 --> 02:37:48.098
LIAM: It's like a flame dagger and a flame sword.

02:37:48.098 --> 02:37:50.048
MATT: It's a variation to a similar idea.

02:37:50.048 --> 02:37:52.647
LAURA: Cool, cool, cool.
SAM: Oh, can cast--

02:37:52.647 --> 02:37:53.867
TALIESIN: Someone being fancy.

02:37:53.867 --> 02:37:55.290
LIAM: But this thing,

02:37:55.290 --> 02:37:57.267
now that I've finished, could be left here

02:37:57.267 --> 02:37:58.838
or some other time.

02:37:58.838 --> 02:38:02.468
And the moment our pursuants enter its range

02:38:02.468 --> 02:38:05.144
it will go off, whether or not we are here.

02:38:06.002 --> 02:38:08.198
Depends on if we think that is a big enough--

02:38:08.198 --> 02:38:09.231
MARISHA: That's the time bomb?

02:38:09.231 --> 02:38:12.734
SAM: If we set it, and it doesn't go off

02:38:12.734 --> 02:38:14.974
because no one follows us,

02:38:14.974 --> 02:38:17.560
can we unset it and use it again another time,

02:38:17.560 --> 02:38:19.561
or is it one use only?

02:38:19.561 --> 02:38:20.452
TRAVIS: That's a good question.

02:38:20.452 --> 02:38:23.569
It can be psychically triggered, but--

02:38:23.569 --> 02:38:27.063
LAURA: This is so-- the range is so far.

02:38:27.063 --> 02:38:28.938
TRAVIS: Three hundo.

02:38:30.061 --> 02:38:32.561
SAM: But Caleb would set it off with his mind.

02:38:32.561 --> 02:38:33.832
TALIESIN: 300's a long way.

02:38:33.832 --> 02:38:35.416
TRAVIS: Yeah, you want to save that shot.

02:38:35.416 --> 02:38:36.262
MARISHA: I agree.

02:38:36.262 --> 02:38:38.261
TALIESIN: Yeah.
SAM: Can it be reused?

02:38:38.261 --> 02:38:40.577
MARISHA: I don't think this is it.
TALIESIN: No, it's a one off.

02:38:40.577 --> 02:38:42.468
LIAM: Well, if it doesn't go off, it can be reused

02:38:42.468 --> 02:38:44.471
but if it goes off, that's it.

02:38:44.471 --> 02:38:47.345
MARISHA: We're about to face

02:38:47.345 --> 02:38:49.954
something extraordinary in Aeor.

02:38:51.954 --> 02:38:53.180
Who knows what we need.

02:38:53.180 --> 02:38:54.426
TALIESIN: Let's save it.

02:38:54.426 --> 02:38:57.084
SAM: But if you leave it and put up your string,

02:38:57.084 --> 02:38:59.376
you'll know when someone comes in the room

02:38:59.376 --> 02:39:03.038
and then you can decide to use it or not. Right?

02:39:03.038 --> 02:39:04.504
TALIESIN: Or they find it and take it.

02:39:04.504 --> 02:39:06.754
LIAM: I won't know who or what.

02:39:08.088 --> 02:39:11.138
LAURA: Yeah. You wouldn't know if they come in.

02:39:12.149 --> 02:39:15.110
TALIESIN: It just seems like not enough value for--

02:39:15.110 --> 02:39:16.785
TRAVIS: We've only seen Molly use, like,

02:39:16.785 --> 02:39:18.326
a couple of those glowing eyes.

02:39:18.326 --> 02:39:20.910
What if he's got a Disable Intuit eye?

02:39:20.910 --> 02:39:22.780
Then we're like, "Oh shit!"

02:39:22.780 --> 02:39:25.088
LIAM: I also don't think this would be enough to

02:39:25.088 --> 02:39:26.378
take out Lucien in one shot.

02:39:26.378 --> 02:39:28.377
TALIESIN: I think it'd give us 20 seconds, tops.

02:39:28.377 --> 02:39:29.751
MARISHA: Yeah,

02:39:29.751 --> 02:39:32.884
20 seconds we want to be there for, to fully maximize it.

02:39:32.884 --> 02:39:33.717
Right?

02:39:33.717 --> 02:39:36.800
LIAM: I think this might be better
if we were facing a horde.

02:39:36.800 --> 02:39:37.831
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:39:37.831 --> 02:39:40.975
SAM: Doesn't it take minutes to use?

02:39:40.975 --> 02:39:42.270
LIAM: Spend one minute.

02:39:42.270 --> 02:39:43.667
SAM: Yeah. We can't use it in battle.

02:39:43.667 --> 02:39:45.970
It's a preset thing that you have to put--

02:39:45.970 --> 02:39:46.836
MARISHA: But if you know.

02:39:46.836 --> 02:39:49.913
LIAM: We're being followed by
five or six very powerful people.

02:39:49.913 --> 02:39:52.165
LIAM: We're being followed by
five or six very powerful people.

02:39:52.165 --> 02:39:54.154
I don't think that this is strong enough to take them all

02:39:54.154 --> 02:39:55.442
out in one shot.

02:39:55.442 --> 02:39:56.633
LAURA: I think it's a waste of the item.
SAM: Okay.

02:39:56.633 --> 02:39:58.878
TALIESIN: I'd like to get moving now.
MARISHA: It's great for an ambush

02:39:58.878 --> 02:40:00.969
when we know that we can be there for it.

02:40:00.969 --> 02:40:02.123
SAM: Okay.

02:40:03.132 --> 02:40:05.735
TALIESIN: Are my eyes doing anything?

02:40:05.735 --> 02:40:08.017
MATT: Nothing at the moment, no.
TALIESIN: Okay.

02:40:08.017 --> 02:40:09.440
LAURA: But you can do something.

02:40:09.440 --> 02:40:10.640
TALIESIN: I can leave something.

02:40:10.640 --> 02:40:12.150
It'll be obvious that we've been here,

02:40:12.150 --> 02:40:13.267
but I can leave something.

02:40:13.267 --> 02:40:16.255
It's not a lot, but it'll annoy them.

02:40:17.997 --> 02:40:20.725
SAM: Why don't you guys start lowering me down on the rope?

02:40:20.725 --> 02:40:22.565
ASHLEY: Yeah. I'm helping with the rope.

02:40:22.565 --> 02:40:24.799
TRAVIS: We're doing the butt, behind the butt.

02:40:24.799 --> 02:40:25.632
MATT: Okay.

02:40:26.490 --> 02:40:29.139
So for you, it's relatively open space.

02:40:29.139 --> 02:40:30.764
You don't feel cramped necessarily,

02:40:30.764 --> 02:40:33.631
but it is at an angle that gets a little bit steep

02:40:33.631 --> 02:40:35.064
within the first 10 or so feet.

02:40:35.064 --> 02:40:38.080
And you're lowering yourself now,

02:40:38.080 --> 02:40:41.505
down, down, down, down.

02:40:44.153 --> 02:40:45.499
How long is the rope?

02:40:45.499 --> 02:40:46.957
TRAVIS: 50 feet.
MATT: 50 feet.

02:40:46.957 --> 02:40:49.095
You hit a 50-foot end of the rope where you guys give it,

02:40:49.095 --> 02:40:50.428
and it's still going.

02:40:50.428 --> 02:40:53.017
And so you either have to add more rope or slide.

02:40:53.017 --> 02:40:54.250
ASHLEY: I'll take out--

02:40:54.250 --> 02:40:56.366
I have extra rope, so--

02:40:56.366 --> 02:40:59.998
SAM: I send a message: End of the rope, got any more?

02:40:59.998 --> 02:41:02.415
TALIESIN: Tie it and--
SAM: You can respond.

02:41:05.222 --> 02:41:06.414
TRAVIS: Who'd you send the message to?

02:41:06.414 --> 02:41:08.325
SAM: Oh, to Yasha.

02:41:08.325 --> 02:41:12.821
ASHLEY: Oh, hello. Stand by.

02:41:12.821 --> 02:41:14.488
Take out my 50 feet.

02:41:15.986 --> 02:41:18.112
Okay. Keep going.

02:41:18.112 --> 02:41:20.198
MATT: At about 110 feet down,

02:41:20.198 --> 02:41:21.608
you can see as you're following it

02:41:21.608 --> 02:41:24.941
the straight angled arc downward.

02:41:25.785 --> 02:41:26.626
You're glad you have a rope.

02:41:26.626 --> 02:41:28.865
Because the slide would've been scary, especially

02:41:28.865 --> 02:41:32.727
when you begin to see the shaft that you're in

02:41:32.727 --> 02:41:35.541
just open up, like it blew up

02:41:35.541 --> 02:41:39.574
from the inside and it just falls down into a chamber.

02:41:40.786 --> 02:41:43.183
SAM: So I'm at the end of the rope again?

02:41:43.183 --> 02:41:45.240
MATT: No, you still have more slack to go, but you see--

02:41:45.240 --> 02:41:48.037
you can now see approaching quickly where it just ends

02:41:48.037 --> 02:41:49.794
and opens up into something below.

02:41:49.794 --> 02:41:53.169
You can see beyond about maybe 15, 20 feet across,

02:41:53.169 --> 02:41:57.503
this slide continues, but something beneath it just blew up

02:41:57.503 --> 02:42:01.946
or fell out and opened up the base of this duct.

02:42:01.946 --> 02:42:03.454
SAM: All right. So I'll look out of the duct

02:42:03.454 --> 02:42:06.609
and see what's below in the chamber.

02:42:07.882 --> 02:42:09.814
MATT: What's the darkvision range on that?

02:42:09.814 --> 02:42:11.851
SAM: 60, I think?
MATT: 60, right?

02:42:11.851 --> 02:42:16.851
Okay. You look down and all you see

02:42:17.245 --> 02:42:19.616
are the tops of trees.

02:42:19.616 --> 02:42:22.399
SAM: Trees? What?!

02:42:22.399 --> 02:42:25.076
TALIESIN: Oh my god, we're in the fun ball.

02:42:25.076 --> 02:42:26.684
SAM: Where are we?

02:42:26.684 --> 02:42:30.129
TRAVIS: Boy, it sure feels like it, doesn't it?
MARISHA: The tops of trees...

02:42:30.129 --> 02:42:32.563
SAM: I'll send a message to Yasha.

02:42:32.563 --> 02:42:34.304
I found a room--

02:42:34.304 --> 02:42:37.485
ASHLEY: Oh!
SAM: -- full of trees.

02:42:37.485 --> 02:42:39.110
You can reply to this message.

02:42:41.672 --> 02:42:42.922
ASHLEY: Wha--?

02:42:45.089 --> 02:42:48.572
She's in a room with lots of trees.

02:42:49.726 --> 02:42:52.288
TALIESIN: Well, that's weird.
SAM: Didn't this happen to us once before?

02:42:52.288 --> 02:42:54.542
TRAVIS: Yasha, did you say trees?

02:42:54.542 --> 02:42:57.548
LIAM: The temple where the fruit is from--

02:42:57.548 --> 02:42:59.676
MARISHA: Yeah, speaking of the fruit.
TRAVIS: Oh, the blood fruit.

02:42:59.676 --> 02:43:03.104
LAURA: We should head down, too, then. Right?

02:43:03.104 --> 02:43:04.021
TRAVIS: How, how.

02:43:05.462 --> 02:43:08.070
Can you send a message to--?
SAM: Caleb can.

02:43:08.070 --> 02:43:09.852
TRAVIS: Or should we just shout down damn thing?

02:43:09.852 --> 02:43:12.343
LAURA: I don't want to yell.
ASHLEY: Can you hear us?

02:43:12.343 --> 02:43:14.923
(laughter)

02:43:14.923 --> 02:43:18.532
MATT: You do hear Yasha's voice echo down and above.

02:43:18.532 --> 02:43:20.564
SAM: I can hear you.

02:43:20.564 --> 02:43:22.798
Should I go in or wait for you?

02:43:22.798 --> 02:43:23.764
You can reply to this message.

02:43:23.764 --> 02:43:25.764
TRAVIS: Ask her how far it is.
LAURA: Tell her to wait, tell her to wait.

02:43:27.306 --> 02:43:29.537
ASHLEY: I can't s-- wait!

02:43:29.537 --> 02:43:31.675
(laughter)

02:43:31.675 --> 02:43:33.475
LIAM: But the spell lets you whisper back.

02:43:33.475 --> 02:43:34.908
ASHLEY: It does?
LIAM: Yeah, briefly.

02:43:34.908 --> 02:43:36.535
ASHLEY: Oh, I didn't know that.
SAM: Yeah, you can reply to this message.

02:43:36.535 --> 02:43:38.289
TRAVIS: Keep yelling back, it's great.

02:43:38.289 --> 02:43:41.130
(laughter)

02:43:41.130 --> 02:43:42.888
SAM: Yasha, to clarify,

02:43:42.888 --> 02:43:45.715
you can reply to this message.

02:43:45.715 --> 02:43:46.915
MATT: It's like shouting at the grandparent

02:43:46.915 --> 02:43:48.139
with a hearing aid in.

02:43:48.139 --> 02:43:50.039
They're like, "No, I can hear you."

02:43:50.908 --> 02:43:51.741
TRAVIS: (old person voice) "I said--"

02:43:52.767 --> 02:43:54.955
ASHLEY: Okay, uh, wait right there.

02:43:55.830 --> 02:43:59.153
That's what I'm being told to tell you.

02:43:59.153 --> 02:44:01.095
Be careful.

02:44:01.095 --> 02:44:04.894
Just hold on a second.

02:44:04.894 --> 02:44:07.343
LAURA: It's a life message.

02:44:07.343 --> 02:44:08.211
Is like Sending.

02:44:08.211 --> 02:44:10.832
LIAM: We can't blame her,
this information is in her Blindspot.

02:44:10.832 --> 02:44:11.881
(laughter)

02:44:11.881 --> 02:44:13.114
ASHLEY: (cackles)

02:44:15.785 --> 02:44:17.535
Okay. What do we do? What do we do?

02:44:17.535 --> 02:44:18.455
LAURA: We should head down.

02:44:18.455 --> 02:44:20.335
MARISHA: Okay. Let's lower people down.

02:44:20.335 --> 02:44:22.225
ASHLEY: Okay. We're going to come down there.

02:44:22.225 --> 02:44:23.624
I don't know if I can still reply.

02:44:23.624 --> 02:44:24.865
SAM: Nope.
ASHLEY: But if I can--

02:44:24.865 --> 02:44:26.123
SAM: Nope.

02:44:26.123 --> 02:44:27.512
LIAM: I pull out a wire and say:

02:44:27.512 --> 02:44:29.285
Listen, just stall for 10 minutes.

02:44:29.285 --> 02:44:31.150
Don't go anywhere.
I'm putting up a wire.

02:44:31.150 --> 02:44:34.535
And I start to ritually cast Alarm

02:44:34.535 --> 02:44:36.945
and I'm putting up the silver wire

02:44:36.945 --> 02:44:39.462
at this passageway that we're all going into.

02:44:39.462 --> 02:44:40.787
MATT: Okay.

02:44:40.787 --> 02:44:42.878
ASHLEY: Should we tie another rope?
LAURA: I'm going to head down.

02:44:42.878 --> 02:44:44.827
TRAVIS: The rope?
LAURA: So there's a cleric on both sides.

02:44:44.827 --> 02:44:46.037
TRAVIS: The rope?
LAURA: Yeah.

02:44:46.037 --> 02:44:47.717
TRAVIS: But h-- do you--

02:44:47.717 --> 02:44:49.115
She sees the tops of the trees?

02:44:49.115 --> 02:44:50.541
Like, is she looking down

02:44:50.541 --> 02:44:53.658
and it's like hundreds of feet to the tops of trees.

02:44:54.832 --> 02:44:55.665
MATT: Looking down--

02:44:55.665 --> 02:44:57.140
SAM: 60 feet.
MARISHA: Is there a landing?

02:44:57.140 --> 02:45:00.601
MATT: Correct. You can see the tops of trees.

02:45:00.601 --> 02:45:02.085
Some that are a little bit closer,

02:45:02.085 --> 02:45:02.918
some that are further away,

02:45:02.918 --> 02:45:04.758
and some patches are just darkness beyond

02:45:04.758 --> 02:45:06.068
that you do not-- they're beyond

02:45:06.068 --> 02:45:09.755
your 60-foot visual range.
TRAVIS: She's fucking up there, bro.

02:45:09.755 --> 02:45:10.955
MATT: But, I mean, the closest tree is

02:45:10.955 --> 02:45:13.045
about maybe 40 feet below you.

02:45:13.045 --> 02:45:15.015
MARISHA: Is she on a landing?

02:45:15.015 --> 02:45:17.888
MATT: No, she's holding onto a rope.

02:45:17.888 --> 02:45:18.855
SAM: Air-conditioning duct--

02:45:18.855 --> 02:45:19.905
MARISHA: That's different.

02:45:19.905 --> 02:45:23.491
LIAM: Yeah, this is like a nursery in a spaceship.

02:45:23.491 --> 02:45:25.545
TRAVIS: She way up.
ASHLEY: Should we tie another rope?

02:45:25.545 --> 02:45:26.603
LAURA: Yeah, but I don't think we--

02:45:26.603 --> 02:45:27.702
MARISHA: I don't know if we have any more.

02:45:27.702 --> 02:45:29.921
TALIESIN: I think I have a rope.
MARISHA: Do we have any more?

02:45:29.921 --> 02:45:31.355
I know I'm using mine.

02:45:31.355 --> 02:45:32.625
You're using yours.

02:45:32.625 --> 02:45:35.008
LAURA: If you have some, Caduceus, that'd be clutch.

02:45:38.536 --> 02:45:40.935
TALIESIN: Apparently don't have a rope?

02:45:40.935 --> 02:45:42.827
TRAVIS: Pitons, or what are they called?

02:45:42.827 --> 02:45:44.210
SAM: Pitons?
MATT: Yeah, pitons.

02:45:44.210 --> 02:45:46.735
SAM: I mean, I can make it to the top of a tree, no problem.

02:45:46.735 --> 02:45:48.045
But you guys said to wait.

02:45:48.045 --> 02:45:49.043
TRAVIS: How many people can you Feather Fall?

02:45:49.043 --> 02:45:50.585
TALIESIN: Nope, don't have a rope.

02:45:50.585 --> 02:45:53.085
MARISHA: I was going to say, I could slide down the wall.

02:45:53.085 --> 02:45:54.255
I could maybe get down there.

02:45:54.255 --> 02:45:56.995
MATT: Funny bit of a trivia.

02:45:56.995 --> 02:46:00.345
I learned what pitons were because of 2nd edition D&amp;D.

02:46:00.345 --> 02:46:02.535
Climber's kits. Because they give you pitons and crampons,

02:46:02.535 --> 02:46:03.855
which I didn't know what a crampon was,

02:46:03.855 --> 02:46:05.553
and for the longest time went like--

02:46:05.553 --> 02:46:07.705
(laughter)

02:46:07.705 --> 02:46:09.513
LAURA: I mean useful, always.

02:46:09.513 --> 02:46:11.445
MATT: But, you know.
MARISHA: Good to have a few

02:46:11.445 --> 02:46:14.175
in your purse for whenever you, you know,

02:46:14.175 --> 02:46:15.205
aren't expecting things.

02:46:15.205 --> 02:46:17.153
LIAM: Is crampon more accurate?

02:46:17.153 --> 02:46:18.847
(laughter)

02:46:18.847 --> 02:46:20.375
MARISHA: Yes. Yes it is.
LAURA: Heck yeah, I feel like.

02:46:20.375 --> 02:46:21.944
MATT: That was the problem.

02:46:21.944 --> 02:46:24.832
Anyway! What are we doing?

02:46:24.832 --> 02:46:25.673
TALIESIN: So we can--

02:46:25.673 --> 02:46:27.265
LIAM: I could ferry us down, too,

02:46:27.265 --> 02:46:28.905
if I dropped down the rope a bit

02:46:28.905 --> 02:46:30.125
and turn it into something.

02:46:30.125 --> 02:46:32.885
I could carry people up and down.

02:46:32.885 --> 02:46:34.475
LAURA: Oh, right.
MARISHA: I mean.

02:46:34.475 --> 02:46:37.690
LAURA: It-- yes.
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:46:37.690 --> 02:46:39.685
TALIESIN: Or we could take the rope a little further down

02:46:39.685 --> 02:46:42.102
after it's untied and then--

02:46:42.102 --> 02:46:45.515
MARISHA: I'm good at-- I'm good at rock climbing

02:46:45.515 --> 02:46:47.555
and sliding on walls. Let me go.

02:46:47.555 --> 02:46:48.388
TRAVIS: Yeah, go for it.

02:46:48.388 --> 02:46:49.635
MARISHA: I'll meet Veth down there.

02:46:49.635 --> 02:46:51.465
TRAVIS: We'll take the fourth piece of rope as well.

02:46:51.465 --> 02:46:52.795
So we have 200 feet total.

02:46:52.795 --> 02:46:55.193
TALIESIN: I do not have a piece of rope.
LAURA: I feel like I said I already went down.

02:46:55.193 --> 02:46:56.265
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:46:56.265 --> 02:46:57.195
LAURA: I did already go down.

02:46:57.195 --> 02:46:59.895
So I'm just holding onto the rope above Veth now.

02:46:59.895 --> 02:47:01.238
But you can still--
SAM: Oh hi!

02:47:01.238 --> 02:47:04.144
LAURA: Hi! You didn't mention that
you weren't on the ground yet.

02:47:04.144 --> 02:47:05.185
SAM: Oh, well--

02:47:05.185 --> 02:47:06.601
LAURA: So, you know.
SAM: Oh, I did,

02:47:06.601 --> 02:47:08.878
but Yasha just didn't convey it.

02:47:10.561 --> 02:47:13.182
MARISHA: As I'm sliding down doing this one,

02:47:13.182 --> 02:47:16.947
I say: Don't fucking blame it on Yasha, okay?

02:47:16.947 --> 02:47:19.095
Don't blame your communication problems on her, okay?

02:47:19.095 --> 02:47:21.253
And then I--
SAM: She intimidates me, that's all.

02:47:21.253 --> 02:47:23.469
MARISHA: Well, th-- yeah, same. Okay?

02:47:23.469 --> 02:47:24.615
(laughter)

02:47:24.615 --> 02:47:25.565
Same.

02:47:25.565 --> 02:47:26.974
SAM: I just find myself tongue tied.

02:47:26.974 --> 02:47:28.165
MARISHA: Yeah. Ye--

02:47:28.165 --> 02:47:29.123
SAM: Where are you going?

02:47:29.123 --> 02:47:30.925
MARISHA: I'm going to try and see how far this is.

02:47:30.925 --> 02:47:32.825
LAURA: Are you hanging from my shoulders at this point?

02:47:32.825 --> 02:47:33.835
Because I feel like you are.

02:47:33.835 --> 02:47:36.035
MARISHA: No, I'm hanging from the lip.

02:47:36.035 --> 02:47:37.505
MATT: Okay. So here's the thing.

02:47:37.505 --> 02:47:40.785
This duct is big enough

02:47:40.785 --> 02:47:42.265
to carry you one at a time.

02:47:42.265 --> 02:47:43.098
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:47:43.098 --> 02:47:45.019
MATT: Veth is currently the blockage,

02:47:45.019 --> 02:47:46.225
and then there is Jester,

02:47:46.225 --> 02:47:48.165
and then you've come in here.

02:47:48.165 --> 02:47:49.125
There's no way to get around.

02:47:49.125 --> 02:47:51.355
MARISHA: Oh, I thought I was trying to squeeze around.

02:47:51.355 --> 02:47:53.085
MATT: Not enough room.
SAM: Before you go through.

02:47:53.085 --> 02:47:55.125
Jester, you're close.
MARISHA: Oh no.

02:47:55.125 --> 02:47:57.225
SAM: Where do you sense the ping?

02:47:57.225 --> 02:48:00.215
LAURA: Well, the thing is, Caleb took a few minutes

02:48:00.215 --> 02:48:04.485
to identify this awesome wand-- rod that I'm now holding.

02:48:04.485 --> 02:48:07.181
So I have no idea where that ping is any more, but--

02:48:07.181 --> 02:48:09.615
SAM: So is the goal to get to the tops of these trees?

02:48:09.615 --> 02:48:12.890
Because I feel like any one of us could do that.

02:48:12.890 --> 02:48:15.097
LAURA: I think that's the goal.
SAM: Or I could Feather Fall us all.

02:48:15.097 --> 02:48:17.445
MARISHA: I-- uh.

02:48:17.445 --> 02:48:19.245
You're in the way.

02:48:19.245 --> 02:48:20.835
MATT: The rope is dangling free, like--

02:48:20.835 --> 02:48:21.965
because you only have a hundred feet of rope,

02:48:21.965 --> 02:48:24.465
and about 70 or so feet is where you came to this breakage.

02:48:24.465 --> 02:48:27.095
There's 30 feet going down and it's--

02:48:27.095 --> 02:48:28.411
SAM: I'll start climbing down the rope,

02:48:28.411 --> 02:48:29.775
LAURA: Oh, well, then I'll keep going.

02:48:29.775 --> 02:48:30.905
MATT: So you start climbing down the rope

02:48:30.905 --> 02:48:31.815
and you get to the end of the rope

02:48:31.815 --> 02:48:35.715
and you're about 10 feet above the first tree

02:48:35.715 --> 02:48:37.165
that's beneath you.

02:48:37.165 --> 02:48:38.585
LAURA: It looks a lot closer now.
SAM: And it's the top

02:48:38.585 --> 02:48:40.605
of a tree, so it's not very strong.

02:48:40.605 --> 02:48:42.205
TRAVIS: And it's like darkness underneath.

02:48:42.205 --> 02:48:43.775
Like, it's trees and then darkness.

02:48:43.775 --> 02:48:45.475
SAM: You want to do this first or me?

02:48:47.455 --> 02:48:50.110
LAURA: Are you hanging on the lip now?
TRAVIS: Could be a sequoia.

02:48:50.110 --> 02:48:52.355
MARISHA: We're both hanging from the rope right?

02:48:52.355 --> 02:48:54.886
SAM: I let go, and I'm going to try to grab the tree.

02:48:54.886 --> 02:48:57.245
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and make an acrobatics check.

02:48:57.245 --> 02:48:59.665
LAURA: Oh my god.
TRAVIS: They're not trees.

02:48:59.665 --> 02:49:00.895
SAM: 27.

02:49:00.895 --> 02:49:04.398
MATT: 27, okay. The tree just splits--

02:49:05.541 --> 02:49:07.206
TRAVIS: The thing. (roaring)

02:49:07.206 --> 02:49:09.356
MATT: You maneuver yourself a bit to swing

02:49:09.356 --> 02:49:11.975
and then release, tumble a bit in the air

02:49:11.975 --> 02:49:14.057
and grab for the top of the tree.

02:49:14.057 --> 02:49:15.275
They're not pines.

02:49:15.275 --> 02:49:17.565
It's a little bit of a tangled mass of

02:49:17.565 --> 02:49:19.435
branches in this canopy.

02:49:19.435 --> 02:49:22.202
And as you reach and grab for something,

02:49:22.202 --> 02:49:27.202
it's like hitting a bed of fall time leaves very hard

02:49:27.602 --> 02:49:30.995
with sticks underneath it.

02:49:30.995 --> 02:49:33.835
So you hit, grab, and you're like-- (groaning)

02:49:33.835 --> 02:49:35.355
You do take--

02:49:35.355 --> 02:49:37.425
MARISHA: Did you not experience that lie as a kid?

02:49:37.425 --> 02:49:39.808
MATT: Four points of bludgeoning damage,
just from the impact.

02:49:39.808 --> 02:49:42.095
But you are now holding into the canopy of the tree.

02:49:42.095 --> 02:49:44.905
As soon as you hold it and glance around,

02:49:44.905 --> 02:49:46.335
since there is no light source in here,

02:49:46.335 --> 02:49:47.325
you're relying on darkvision.

02:49:47.325 --> 02:49:49.215
You don't get any spectrum of color,

02:49:49.215 --> 02:49:51.365
but you are seeing that at least the branches

02:49:51.365 --> 02:49:54.435
are very pale in your darkvision.

02:49:54.435 --> 02:49:56.765
And the leaves are very dry.

02:49:56.765 --> 02:49:59.145
Like when you hit and you grab,

02:49:59.145 --> 02:50:03.905
you don't feel the same flexibility

02:50:03.905 --> 02:50:08.905
and bounciness that vibrant tree and plant life has.

02:50:09.385 --> 02:50:10.895
It seems like the branches are just stiff,

02:50:10.895 --> 02:50:14.855
and the leaves are frail, and just fall away.

02:50:14.855 --> 02:50:17.189
Like it's petrified.

02:50:17.189 --> 02:50:19.738
SAM: Oh, interesting.
MATT: Something like that.

02:50:19.738 --> 02:50:21.617
SAM: Okay. I mean, I'm here.

02:50:21.617 --> 02:50:23.872
Do you want to come or are we waiting for people?

02:50:23.872 --> 02:50:25.288
LAURA: Was it a long drop?

02:50:25.288 --> 02:50:26.405
SAM: No, it's just 10 feet.

02:50:26.405 --> 02:50:28.924
MARISHA: But you're in the tree.

02:50:28.924 --> 02:50:29.925
SAM: Yeah, I'm on a tree now.

02:50:29.925 --> 02:50:32.045
MARISHA: How tall is the tree? Can you see the bottom?

02:50:32.045 --> 02:50:33.225
SAM: Can I see the bottom?

02:50:33.225 --> 02:50:34.435
MATT: No.

02:50:34.435 --> 02:50:36.501
SAM: Bigger than 60.

02:50:36.501 --> 02:50:38.907
Oh, and you're blind, aren't you?
MATT: Well, it's not so much that it's bigger than 60.

02:50:38.907 --> 02:50:40.835
It is too dense for you to look past.

02:50:40.835 --> 02:50:42.925
You are at the top of a tree, looking through its canopy,

02:50:42.925 --> 02:50:44.025
and it's too dense for you to see.

02:50:44.025 --> 02:50:46.775
SAM: Want me to climb down and see how far it goes?

02:50:46.775 --> 02:50:47.925
TRAVIS: Yep, by yourself, go.

02:50:48.865 --> 02:50:50.139
LAURA: This is so dumb.

02:50:50.139 --> 02:50:51.294
TRAVIS: Adventuring party.
SAM: Why is this dumb?

02:50:51.294 --> 02:50:52.585
TRAVIS: Adventuring party. Great! We got it.

02:50:52.585 --> 02:50:53.862
MARISHA: Do you want me to try and jump to the tree

02:50:53.862 --> 02:50:54.925
and then you can go?

02:50:54.925 --> 02:50:56.455
SAM: You cannot see.

02:50:56.455 --> 02:51:01.272
MARISHA: I can listen to the
sound of your voice and have faith.

02:51:01.272 --> 02:51:06.272
SAM: You're going to jump, and use your hearing to catch?

02:51:06.365 --> 02:51:07.275
TRAVIS: Echo location.

02:51:07.275 --> 02:51:09.771
MATT: Daredevil this shit.
MARISHA: Yeah!

02:51:09.771 --> 02:51:11.645
LAURA: Can I call up the--

02:51:11.645 --> 02:51:16.112
Can I call up the-- whatever that thing is.

02:51:16.112 --> 02:51:17.155
The tunnel?
MATT: Yeah.

02:51:17.155 --> 02:51:18.315
TRAVIS: The chute.

02:51:18.315 --> 02:51:19.323
SAM: The AC duct?

02:51:19.323 --> 02:51:21.238
LAURA: Yeah, the--

02:51:21.238 --> 02:51:24.901
Caleb. We need some light.

02:51:24.901 --> 02:51:26.318
Use your baubbles.

02:51:27.368 --> 02:51:29.084
LIAM: I'm busy with the wire.

02:51:29.084 --> 02:51:30.200
TALIESIN: I can head that way.

02:51:30.200 --> 02:51:34.013
LIAM: And also I can turn into a giant fucking owl.

02:51:34.013 --> 02:51:35.926
You crazy people.
LAURA: Oh, so can I.

02:51:35.926 --> 02:51:38.185
SAM: I mean, I could just climb down the tree.

02:51:38.185 --> 02:51:40.945
MARISHA: I do have the rest of the celebone, if you want to

02:51:40.945 --> 02:51:42.885
at least see.
LAURA: Oh yeah! I got a celebone!

02:51:42.885 --> 02:51:45.533
MARISHA: Here, I crack out the rest of my celebone.
LAURA: You're brilliant.

02:51:45.533 --> 02:51:47.408
MARISHA: Crack! And I throw it down.

02:51:47.408 --> 02:51:49.908
MATT: You watch as the raves start.

02:51:49.908 --> 02:51:51.305
TALIESIN: ♪ (humming upbeat music) ♪
MARISHA: ♪ (beatboxing) ♪

02:51:51.305 --> 02:51:52.178
MATT: You catch it, you said?

02:51:52.178 --> 02:51:53.435
SAM: Are you throwing it to me,

02:51:53.435 --> 02:51:55.195
or just dropping it to see how far it goes?

02:51:55.195 --> 02:51:56.655
MARISHA: I am blind so--

02:51:56.655 --> 02:51:57.785
SAM: Cool, you threw it.

02:51:57.785 --> 02:51:58.618
MATT: She threw it.

02:51:58.618 --> 02:52:00.418
TRAVIS: Anything that's down there is going to be like

02:52:00.418 --> 02:52:01.435
(whooshing).

02:52:01.435 --> 02:52:04.205
MATT: So you watch now as the celebone, blinking,

02:52:04.205 --> 02:52:06.763
falls into the canopy, and you hear the sound of it

02:52:06.763 --> 02:52:08.870
(impacts).

02:52:08.870 --> 02:52:09.960
MARISHA: Did you catch it?

02:52:09.960 --> 02:52:11.505
SAM: Nope.
MARISHA: Okay.

02:52:11.505 --> 02:52:12.344
LAURA: I'll pull out

02:52:12.344 --> 02:52:15.202
another celebone.
MATT: And you can very faintly see

02:52:15.202 --> 02:52:19.731
this very, very muted, flashing coloration

02:52:19.731 --> 02:52:20.705
below the canopy.

02:52:20.705 --> 02:52:23.095
TRAVIS: Way down.
MATT: So it did reach a bottom.

02:52:23.095 --> 02:52:25.335
MARISHA: Do we see any movement blocking the light?

02:52:25.335 --> 02:52:26.665
Like cutting into it?

02:52:26.665 --> 02:52:29.095
MATT: Oh, there was so much canopy you have no fucking clue.

02:52:29.095 --> 02:52:30.735
Like, you can just barely make out that there's

02:52:30.735 --> 02:52:32.235
light down there right now.

02:52:32.235 --> 02:52:33.068
There's just hints of it.

02:52:33.068 --> 02:52:35.315
It's like someone had a disco ball

02:52:35.315 --> 02:52:38.295
in their in their bedroom at another apartment building,

02:52:38.295 --> 02:52:39.855
and you could just barely tell that there's a light moving.

02:52:39.855 --> 02:52:41.345
TRAVIS: Hey monsters, we're over here.

02:52:41.345 --> 02:52:44.735
LAURA: I pull out the disco ball right next to us.

02:52:44.735 --> 02:52:46.012
So I'll pull out another celebone

02:52:46.012 --> 02:52:48.589
and just hold it like a light stick.

02:52:48.589 --> 02:52:50.200
MATT: ♪ (techno beat) ♪ Wherever you guys are.

02:52:50.200 --> 02:52:51.469
TRAVIS: Why were we whispering?

02:52:51.469 --> 02:52:52.924
What was the point of whispering

02:52:52.924 --> 02:52:54.705
if we're breaking out the fucking rave sticks?

02:52:54.705 --> 02:52:58.628
ASHLEY: Yes, hello, Nott, I'm making sure you are okay.

02:52:58.628 --> 02:52:59.772
Does this work?

02:53:01.005 --> 02:53:02.430
(laughter)

02:53:02.430 --> 02:53:03.885
ASHLEY: She's not talking to me any more.

02:53:03.885 --> 02:53:04.728
I don't know what's happening.

02:53:04.728 --> 02:53:08.147
MATT: She's-- That is hilarious.

02:53:08.147 --> 02:53:10.266
ASHLEY: Just think it always works?

02:53:10.266 --> 02:53:11.796
MATT: I love it. I love it.

02:53:11.796 --> 02:53:12.789
ASHLEY: Hello?

02:53:13.639 --> 02:53:14.957
TRAVIS: What's the matter?
She doesn't hear you anymore?

02:53:14.957 --> 02:53:16.861
ASHLEY: No, I think there's no service.

02:53:16.861 --> 02:53:18.395
MATT: Walk 10 feet this way.

02:53:18.395 --> 02:53:19.885
TRAVIS: Something's terribly wrong.

02:53:19.885 --> 02:53:21.342
ASHLEY: Can you hear me yet?

02:53:21.342 --> 02:53:23.264
(laughter)

02:53:23.264 --> 02:53:24.613
MATT: All right, so you're coming down the tree.

02:53:24.613 --> 02:53:25.685
SAM: Stealthily.

02:53:25.685 --> 02:53:26.518
MATT: Stealthily?
MARISHA: You keep grabbing

02:53:26.518 --> 02:53:28.890
your earlobe for no reason.
MATT: Okay.

02:53:28.890 --> 02:53:29.992
ASHLEY: What does this mean?

02:53:29.992 --> 02:53:30.825
I don't know. I thought it would help.

02:53:30.825 --> 02:53:32.258
MATT: Make a stealth check with disadvantage.

02:53:32.258 --> 02:53:33.840
SAM: Sure.
MARISHA: I think it's better connection.

02:53:33.840 --> 02:53:36.285
MATT: Which, because you have
advantage anyway with your cloak,

02:53:36.285 --> 02:53:38.035
it would be just a straight roll. So just--

02:53:38.035 --> 02:53:39.235
SAM: Well, I rolled twice.

02:53:39.235 --> 02:53:40.635
MATT: Well, roll once, then.

02:53:42.675 --> 02:53:43.508
SAM: 27.

02:53:43.508 --> 02:53:46.455
MATT: Okay. So you feel confident in the quietness

02:53:46.455 --> 02:53:47.608
of your descent.

02:53:50.418 --> 02:53:51.455
Go ahead and make...

02:53:52.895 --> 02:53:54.745
Go ahead and make an athletics check.

02:53:58.515 --> 02:54:00.105
SAM: 24.

02:54:00.105 --> 02:54:02.555
MATT: 24 athletics. Nice.

02:54:02.555 --> 02:54:04.535
You manage to deftly make your way

02:54:04.535 --> 02:54:07.775
through the clustered mass that is this tree's canopy.

02:54:07.775 --> 02:54:11.012
The center portion of this tree seems to warp

02:54:11.012 --> 02:54:13.090
and bend in odd ways

02:54:13.090 --> 02:54:14.945
and the branches scatter off and tangle.

02:54:14.945 --> 02:54:16.675
And at the edges of them, you can see them

02:54:16.675 --> 02:54:19.015
beginning to wrap around and knot with the branches

02:54:19.015 --> 02:54:21.105
of other nearby trees at different heights.

02:54:21.105 --> 02:54:25.716
There is something unnatural about this.

02:54:25.716 --> 02:54:26.765
Make an intelligence check for me.

02:54:26.765 --> 02:54:28.211
SAM: Oh boy.
LAURA: Oh no.

02:54:30.203 --> 02:54:31.505
SAM: Nine.

02:54:31.505 --> 02:54:34.015
MATT: Nine. You keep climbing down

02:54:34.015 --> 02:54:35.065
SAM: Weird.

02:54:35.065 --> 02:54:35.898
MATT: This is weird.

02:54:36.825 --> 02:54:41.225
But about 80 or so feet of climbing downward,

02:54:41.225 --> 02:54:43.185
you find the floor.

02:54:43.185 --> 02:54:45.345
And as you glance out and look,

02:54:45.345 --> 02:54:47.825
it's like the floor of an actual forest.

02:54:47.825 --> 02:54:49.735
It has a soft underbrush

02:54:49.735 --> 02:54:53.487
and you can see where numerous leaves and elements

02:54:53.487 --> 02:54:57.185
of vegetation have grown this soft floor

02:54:57.185 --> 02:55:00.428
between the trunks of this forest.

02:55:03.622 --> 02:55:05.205
That's about it. You don't see any rocks.

02:55:05.205 --> 02:55:07.352
It's odd because it looks like a forest,

02:55:07.352 --> 02:55:11.965
but it's level, like there aren't variations in the hills.

02:55:11.965 --> 02:55:13.515
It isn't a natural hillside or anything.

02:55:13.515 --> 02:55:17.215
It is a level floor with a forest landscape

02:55:17.215 --> 02:55:18.905
built over it, it seems.

02:55:18.905 --> 02:55:20.346
And you don't see rocks

02:55:20.346 --> 02:55:23.638
or any other non-tree oriented--
SAM: And the ground is dirt?

02:55:24.645 --> 02:55:26.732
MATT: Do you climb all the way to the ground to check?

02:55:26.732 --> 02:55:28.740
SAM: (hesitant) Sure.

02:55:28.740 --> 02:55:30.546
TRAVIS: It's pitch dark except for her goggles, right?

02:55:30.546 --> 02:55:31.712
MATT: Correct.
SAM: Well, there's also

02:55:31.712 --> 02:55:32.545
a disco ball.
LAURA: And the celebone.

02:55:32.545 --> 02:55:33.536
MATT: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Yep.

02:55:35.555 --> 02:55:38.405
SAM: I guess when I'm just above the ground,

02:55:38.405 --> 02:55:42.445
I will cast Mage Hand and dig up some dirt with it.

02:55:42.445 --> 02:55:43.888
MATT: Okay. Do so--

02:55:45.085 --> 02:55:47.825
There's no dirt necessarily on this top layer.

02:55:47.825 --> 02:55:49.933
It's mostly compost.

02:55:49.933 --> 02:55:51.228
SAM: Compost.

02:55:52.355 --> 02:55:53.505
MATT: Though it's very dry.

02:55:53.505 --> 02:55:56.415
There's no moisture, or at least very little moisture

02:55:56.415 --> 02:55:58.145
you can even ascertain from this as the Mage Hand

02:55:58.145 --> 02:55:59.845
pulls it and lets it fall.

02:56:03.071 --> 02:56:06.175
SAM: And I'll Mage Hand over to the disco ball,

02:56:06.175 --> 02:56:11.175
to the celebone and pick it up and just bring it back to me.

02:56:12.413 --> 02:56:14.195
Do I see anyone watching me or anything?

02:56:14.195 --> 02:56:17.155
MATT: Make a perception check with disadvantage

02:56:17.155 --> 02:56:19.135
because even though you have darkvision,

02:56:19.135 --> 02:56:21.688
at this distance, you're glancing beyond that range.

02:56:22.705 --> 02:56:23.665
SAM: 14.

02:56:23.665 --> 02:56:25.985
MATT: 14. You don't see anything.

02:56:25.985 --> 02:56:28.215
SAM: Okay. I'll bring the celebone back

02:56:28.215 --> 02:56:29.825
and sort of shove it in my--

02:56:29.825 --> 02:56:30.795
MARISHA: You can turn it off.

02:56:30.795 --> 02:56:32.062
SAM: Oh, you can--
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

02:56:32.062 --> 02:56:32.915
SAM: I don't have these.

02:56:32.915 --> 02:56:34.045
I'll turn it off.

02:56:34.045 --> 02:56:34.965
MATT: All right.

02:56:34.965 --> 02:56:37.488
SAM: Okay. I'll cast another message.

02:56:38.974 --> 02:56:40.205
It might be too far.

02:56:40.205 --> 02:56:42.285
I'll just cast it to Jester this time.

02:56:42.285 --> 02:56:46.724
Hey, Jester! It's like we're in this weird,

02:56:46.724 --> 02:56:49.045
like, man-made garden thing.

02:56:49.045 --> 02:56:51.295
It's not a real forest, but it is. It's really weird.

02:56:51.295 --> 02:56:53.837
We need Caduceus down here. He knows about this stuff.

02:56:53.837 --> 02:56:55.700
LAURA: Oh, good idea.

02:56:56.733 --> 02:56:59.378
Did you see if it's actually dirt on the ground?

02:56:59.378 --> 02:57:01.169
Did you see anybody?

02:57:01.169 --> 02:57:02.395
SAM: I saw--

02:57:02.395 --> 02:57:03.975
It's sort of weird compost dirt.

02:57:03.975 --> 02:57:05.865
It's all just super dry.

02:57:05.865 --> 02:57:07.265
No people.

02:57:07.265 --> 02:57:08.698
LAURA: How big are the trees?

02:57:10.987 --> 02:57:12.600
SAM: I think they were like 80 feet?

02:57:12.600 --> 02:57:14.301
MATT: The one that you went down was about 80 feet,

02:57:14.301 --> 02:57:15.665
but that was also one of the highest ones here.

02:57:15.665 --> 02:57:17.115
There are others that are smaller.

02:57:17.115 --> 02:57:18.925
You saw some as you went down

02:57:18.925 --> 02:57:23.024
that maybe went closer to 60, some 40 even.

02:57:23.024 --> 02:57:24.635
The one that you're on right now is an outlier

02:57:24.635 --> 02:57:26.275
for its height, comparatively.

02:57:26.275 --> 02:57:27.595
SAM: 80 feet max.

02:57:27.595 --> 02:57:28.625
LAURA: Well, that seems pretty far.

02:57:28.625 --> 02:57:30.225
Do you hear anything down there?

02:57:31.505 --> 02:57:32.671
SAM: Just you, baby.

02:57:34.105 --> 02:57:35.955
MARISHA: Are there people? Did you find a village?

02:57:35.955 --> 02:57:36.788
How big are the trees?

02:57:36.788 --> 02:57:39.745
MARISHA: She says that the trees
are, you know, like 80 feet.

02:57:39.745 --> 02:57:40.945
She doesn't see anybody.

02:57:40.945 --> 02:57:41.778
MARISHA: That's a big-ass tree.

02:57:41.778 --> 02:57:42.815
TALIESIN: Are we rolling yet?

02:57:42.815 --> 02:57:44.265
LAURA: But she wants Caduceus.

02:57:44.265 --> 02:57:45.545
MARISHA: She wants Caduceus?

02:57:45.545 --> 02:57:46.925
LAURA: Yeah, because it's apparently--
MARISHA: Why didn't she want us?

02:57:46.925 --> 02:57:48.451
LAURA: -- it's like-- well, because--
MARISHA: I mean we're here.

02:57:48.451 --> 02:57:49.705
LAURA: -- we don't know about nature the same way

02:57:49.705 --> 02:57:50.725
that Caduceus does, you know?

02:57:50.725 --> 02:57:54.879
MARISHA: Well, I mean, it's a tree.

02:57:54.879 --> 02:57:55.845
LAURA: That's true.

02:57:55.845 --> 02:57:57.455
MARISHA: I could look at it and say it's a tree.

02:57:57.455 --> 02:57:59.575
LAURA: That's true. I mean, I could say that, too.

02:57:59.575 --> 02:58:02.655
MARISHA: Okay. Caduceus is slow as fuck,

02:58:02.655 --> 02:58:05.385
so while he gets down here, I'm going to go on and go.

02:58:05.385 --> 02:58:07.151
SAM: This is the episode we all turn on each other.

02:58:07.151 --> 02:58:08.701
(laughter)

02:58:08.701 --> 02:58:11.035
TRAVIS: It's this cave, you guys!

02:58:11.035 --> 02:58:12.645
MARISHA: I'm just saying he's got, like, a staff

02:58:12.645 --> 02:58:14.995
and his robes and he--

02:58:14.995 --> 02:58:16.575
LAURA: Right.
MARISHA: So I'm just going to

02:58:16.575 --> 02:58:18.805
at least go down there with her.

02:58:18.805 --> 02:58:20.898
LAURA: Okay, yeah. She needs help.
MARISHA: So that she's not alone.

02:58:20.898 --> 02:58:24.318
LAURA: Be stealthy, but Beau. You're pretty blind.

02:58:25.305 --> 02:58:29.355
MARISHA: Yeah, but I've got chroma lights

02:58:29.355 --> 02:58:31.221
flashing from you.
LAURA: Here, take my celebone.

02:58:31.221 --> 02:58:32.257
MARISHA: Okay.

02:58:32.257 --> 02:58:34.092
LAURA: Just in case you need another one.

02:58:34.983 --> 02:58:36.345
MARISHA: Okay.

02:58:36.345 --> 02:58:37.375
LAURA: Okay.

02:58:37.375 --> 02:58:39.083
I haven't turned it off, so it's just like rave

02:58:39.083 --> 02:58:41.655
coming from your pocket.
MARISHA: Just, yeah.

02:58:41.655 --> 02:58:43.575
LAURA: Okay, you go down.

02:58:43.575 --> 02:58:47.205
I'm going to just call up through the tunnel again,

02:58:47.205 --> 02:58:48.955
as quietly, I'm hoping that

02:58:48.955 --> 02:58:52.328
because it's, like, a tunnel, it'll echo the noise up.

02:58:53.615 --> 02:58:54.965
MATT: Okay. What are you doing?

02:58:55.834 --> 02:59:00.376
LAURA: (whisper scream) Caduceus! Veth needs you!

02:59:01.852 --> 02:59:03.541
TALIESIN: Caleb, how close to--

02:59:03.541 --> 02:59:06.025
MATT: I bet this-- I'd say about
this time you've finished up.

02:59:06.025 --> 02:59:07.685
LIAM: Okay. And you've been up here with me the whole time?

02:59:07.685 --> 02:59:09.666
TALIESIN: Yeah
TRAVIS: Me, too.

02:59:09.666 --> 02:59:10.499
ASHLEY: Me three.

02:59:10.499 --> 02:59:13.668
LIAM: Okay. So the wire's up.

02:59:14.835 --> 02:59:15.825
We are still pretty close

02:59:15.825 --> 02:59:18.068
to those two big vats though, right?

02:59:18.068 --> 02:59:20.755
MATT: You're-- yeah, about 20 or so feet from them.

02:59:20.755 --> 02:59:21.875
LIAM: Yeah. We should go down.

02:59:21.875 --> 02:59:24.875
TALIESIN: Yeah. I figured you first,
so that you can catch somebody

02:59:24.875 --> 02:59:26.275
if something stupid happens.

02:59:27.838 --> 02:59:29.545
ASHLEY: Veth, we're coming down.

02:59:29.545 --> 02:59:31.494
I figured maybe you didn't respond

02:59:31.494 --> 02:59:32.838
because I called you Nott,

02:59:32.838 --> 02:59:36.375
so we're coming down in just a moment.

02:59:36.375 --> 02:59:38.631
Please stay safe.

02:59:38.631 --> 02:59:41.765
(laughter)

02:59:41.765 --> 02:59:42.685
Okay.
LAURA: Oh!

02:59:42.685 --> 02:59:45.565
Don't forget to block the entrance!

02:59:45.565 --> 02:59:47.185
MATT: You hear a (thumping).

02:59:47.185 --> 02:59:49.225
TALIESIN: We've got to move right now.
MATT: You glance over and you can see

02:59:49.225 --> 02:59:50.866
just in one of the containers that

02:59:50.866 --> 02:59:52.695
one of the creatures twitched.

02:59:52.695 --> 02:59:53.946
TALIESIN: Right now.
MATT: And then goes back to sleep.

02:59:53.946 --> 02:59:55.547
ASHLEY: Time to go.
MARISHA: What now?

02:59:55.547 --> 02:59:57.425
TALIESIN: Right now! Shh, go, go, go, go, go!

02:59:57.425 --> 02:59:58.485
MARISHA: Okay, while they're doing that,

02:59:58.485 --> 03:00:01.445
I'm going to hop to the tree that I can see

03:00:01.445 --> 03:00:04.365
in the flashing LED light.
MATT: At the bottom of the rope?

03:00:04.365 --> 03:00:05.198
Yeah?

03:00:05.198 --> 03:00:06.545
MARISHA: And I'm going to (grunting)

03:00:06.545 --> 03:00:08.916
And then start to...

03:00:09.799 --> 03:00:11.086
dope monk shit my way down.

03:00:11.086 --> 03:00:11.919
MATT: Make an acrobatics check for me

03:00:11.919 --> 03:00:13.979
as you ♪ (singing dramatic music) ♪

03:00:13.979 --> 03:00:15.354
MARISHA: EMS.

03:00:15.354 --> 03:00:16.187
TRAVIS: EMS.

03:00:17.863 --> 03:00:20.165
MARISHA: Yeah. Okay. 18 total.

03:00:20.165 --> 03:00:20.998
MATT: 18.
MARISHA: Sorry.

03:00:20.998 --> 03:00:23.155
MATT: Easy enough to do from this distance.

03:00:23.155 --> 03:00:25.605
You go ahead and land with a bit of a crunch and an impact.

03:00:25.605 --> 03:00:28.505
Once again, shaking some of these dried leaves free.

03:00:29.823 --> 03:00:31.125
MARISHA: I turn off the celebone.

03:00:31.125 --> 03:00:34.285
MATT: You would still take two points bludgeoning damage,

03:00:34.285 --> 03:00:35.695
but you Slow Fall, monk, you're fine.

03:00:35.695 --> 03:00:37.805
MARISHA: Slow Fall. Okay. Yeah.

03:00:37.805 --> 03:00:39.525
Do I see Veth?

03:00:39.525 --> 03:00:40.815
MATT: No, Veth is nowhere in sight.

03:00:40.815 --> 03:00:41.648
MARISHA: I don't see Veth?

03:00:41.648 --> 03:00:43.315
MATT: No.
SAM: 80 feet down.

03:00:43.315 --> 03:00:44.896
MARISHA: No, I'm down-- Oh, I'm on the tree.

03:00:44.896 --> 03:00:46.038
MATT and SAM: You're on the tree.

03:00:46.038 --> 03:00:47.785
MARISHA: Okay. I go the rest of the way down.

03:00:47.785 --> 03:00:48.965
MATT: Okay. You go all the way down?

03:00:48.965 --> 03:00:49.798
MARISHA: Yeah.
SAM: I'm hiding.

03:00:49.798 --> 03:00:52.445
MATT: Yeah. You don't see Veth.

03:00:52.445 --> 03:00:55.083
You have the light of a rave stick--

03:00:55.083 --> 03:00:55.958
MARISHA: (whispered) Veth!
MATT: -- to look by

03:00:55.958 --> 03:00:57.032
and you don't see Veth anywhere.

03:00:57.032 --> 03:01:01.334
MARISHA: And I click it off. (whispered) Veth! I'm here!

03:01:01.334 --> 03:01:02.508
You bitch.

03:01:03.805 --> 03:01:06.035
I know you're fucking down here, you bitch.

03:01:06.035 --> 03:01:10.920
(laughter)

03:01:10.920 --> 03:01:15.857
(laughter)

03:01:15.857 --> 03:01:20.549
(laughter)

03:01:20.549 --> 03:01:23.328
SAM: I'm going to try stealth and sneak up on her.

03:01:23.328 --> 03:01:25.618
MARISHA and TRAVIS: You bitch.

03:01:25.618 --> 03:01:30.093
(laughter)

03:01:30.093 --> 03:01:31.545
SAM: 27.

03:01:31.545 --> 03:01:33.905
MATT: She has no idea where you are.

03:01:33.905 --> 03:01:36.506
SAM: I'll give her a wet willy.

03:01:36.506 --> 03:01:37.686
MARISHA: Come on!

03:01:37.686 --> 03:01:40.945
(laughter)

03:01:42.005 --> 03:01:44.690
MATT: Yeah, you got wet willied.
MARISHA: (frustrated groan)

03:01:44.690 --> 03:01:46.185
LIAM: And DM, you described one of those things

03:01:46.185 --> 03:01:49.222
as waking up and in its little hot tub?

03:01:49.222 --> 03:01:50.645
MATT: Or you saw it twitch in there

03:01:50.645 --> 03:01:52.209
and it just hit the glass tubing

03:01:52.209 --> 03:01:54.154
and you heard a (thumping).

03:01:54.154 --> 03:01:56.297
ASHLEY: Caduceus, I'll hold the rope.

03:01:56.297 --> 03:01:57.665
Go, go, go.

03:01:57.665 --> 03:01:59.205
LIAM: I'm so tempted to fuck with that-- Okay.

03:01:59.205 --> 03:02:00.615
I start going down the rope.

03:02:00.615 --> 03:02:01.847
MATT: Okay.

03:02:01.847 --> 03:02:04.521
TALIESIN: I'm next. Guardian of Faith, and I bop out.
TRAVIS: What about the armor? Did you take the armor?

03:02:04.521 --> 03:02:05.354
MATT: Okay.

03:02:05.354 --> 03:02:07.270
LAURA: So Caduceus is the next one down?
LIAM: Veth took the armor.

03:02:07.270 --> 03:02:08.820
TALIESIN: Yeah, after Caleb.

03:02:08.820 --> 03:02:10.308
LIAM: Didn't you take the armor?
LAURA: So wait, Caleb is coming down?

03:02:10.308 --> 03:02:11.399
SAM: I gave it to you to identify it

03:02:11.399 --> 03:02:13.225
when you get a chance.
LIAM: Oh, so I got it.

03:02:13.225 --> 03:02:14.458
LAURA: I'm still hanging on the rope.

03:02:14.458 --> 03:02:15.291
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:02:15.291 --> 03:02:16.173
SAM: Yeah. You don't have to do it now.

03:02:16.173 --> 03:02:17.785
LAURA: I was going to help somebody that needs it,

03:02:17.785 --> 03:02:19.207
but I don't think Caleb needs it.

03:02:19.207 --> 03:02:20.585
TALIESIN: So yeah, on the way out,

03:02:20.585 --> 03:02:24.886
I'm just going to drop this sudden shining armor

03:02:24.886 --> 03:02:27.927
with a shield

03:02:27.927 --> 03:02:30.668
with the crest of the Wild Mother on it.

03:02:30.668 --> 03:02:31.905
And like where the head should be,

03:02:31.905 --> 03:02:34.825
it's just this glowing amethyst rock.

03:02:34.825 --> 03:02:36.275
And it's just going to stand

03:02:36.275 --> 03:02:38.125
in front of the-- about 10 feet away

03:02:38.125 --> 03:02:39.755
from the-- five feet away from the--

03:02:39.755 --> 03:02:41.045
MATT: It just sits there.

03:02:41.045 --> 03:02:43.215
This quiet sentinel of divine energy.

03:02:43.215 --> 03:02:45.265
TRAVIS: What?
LAURA: Nice!

03:02:45.265 --> 03:02:46.722
TRAVIS: What is that?
ASHLEY: That is so cool.

03:02:46.722 --> 03:02:47.903
MATT: Guardian of Faith.
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:02:47.903 --> 03:02:49.355
LAURA: But somebody is going to block the tunnel, right?

03:02:49.355 --> 03:02:51.355
Like, to make it look, like, not obvious

03:02:51.355 --> 03:02:53.825
that we went down a tunnel, like put it--

03:02:53.825 --> 03:02:55.695
I've been saying it! I've been saying it.

03:02:55.695 --> 03:02:57.246
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're going to grab a bunch of shit and--

03:02:57.246 --> 03:02:58.909
LAURA: Like a table or something. (pigeon coo)

03:02:58.909 --> 03:03:01.511
LIAM: We just put a glowing guardian in front of the tube.

03:03:01.511 --> 03:03:03.075
LAURA: Not in front of the (pigeon coo).

03:03:03.075 --> 03:03:04.599
Yeah, but not in front of the tunnel.

03:03:04.599 --> 03:03:06.895
SAM: The (trilling) tunnel.

03:03:06.895 --> 03:03:08.865
TRAVIS: Well, one of us has to hold the rope.

03:03:08.865 --> 03:03:10.155
ASHLEY: I'm holding the rope.
TRAVIS: At the top, okay.

03:03:10.155 --> 03:03:12.355
ASHLEY: You guys go down and then I'm going to--

03:03:12.355 --> 03:03:15.771
TRAVIS: Just slide?
ASHLEY: Get a table over to cover the hole.

03:03:15.771 --> 03:03:18.156
TALIESIN: The guardian's not like right in front of it.

03:03:18.156 --> 03:03:19.085
It's like 10 feet.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

03:03:19.085 --> 03:03:20.905
LIAM: So here's the deal. I'll go down the rope.

03:03:20.905 --> 03:03:22.775
I will lower down it hanging above.

03:03:22.775 --> 03:03:25.505
I will use my transmuter's ability

03:03:25.505 --> 03:03:27.495
just to turn myself into a giant owl.

03:03:27.495 --> 03:03:29.465
So I'm now flying around the rope

03:03:29.465 --> 03:03:31.805
and I will take people down one at a time

03:03:31.805 --> 03:03:32.665
as they follow after.

03:03:32.665 --> 03:03:34.553
MATT: Okay.
TALIESIN: Is there an across, actually?

03:03:34.553 --> 03:03:36.478
SAM: Here's my plan, Beauregard.
LIAM: Is there a what?

03:03:36.478 --> 03:03:37.985
SAM: You lie down on the ground.
MARISHA: Fuck! What?

03:03:37.985 --> 03:03:39.257
SAM: Sorry. I'm right behind you.

03:03:39.257 --> 03:03:40.465
MARISHA: Fuck!

03:03:40.465 --> 03:03:41.298
SAM: My plan is this.

03:03:41.298 --> 03:03:42.459
You lie down on the ground--
MARISHA: Can you at least stand in front of me,

03:03:42.459 --> 03:03:46.334
so I have an audio reference?

03:03:46.334 --> 03:03:47.465
SAM: You lie down on the ground.

03:03:47.465 --> 03:03:50.265
I'll use an image spell

03:03:50.265 --> 03:03:51.795
to make it look like your head's gone.

03:03:51.795 --> 03:03:53.072
So when the others come, they're like,

03:03:53.072 --> 03:03:56.070
"Oh my gosh, she fucking died!"

03:03:56.070 --> 03:03:58.350
MARISHA: Oh, like-- okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:03:58.350 --> 03:04:01.056
SAM: You'll see who likes you and who doesn't really care.

03:04:03.005 --> 03:04:06.115
MARISHA: That's a weird ulterior motive.

03:04:06.115 --> 03:04:07.945
I was just here for the prank of it.

03:04:07.945 --> 03:04:09.280
And then you made it--

03:04:09.280 --> 03:04:11.265
SAM: All right. We don't have to do it.

03:04:12.915 --> 03:04:13.965
MARISHA: It's a good prank, though.

03:04:13.965 --> 03:04:15.098
SAM: It is a good prank.

03:04:16.475 --> 03:04:20.475
MARISHA: Let's workshop it. It's a first draft.

03:04:20.475 --> 03:04:21.495
MATT: As you all begin to bunch up,

03:04:21.495 --> 03:04:23.324
what is this rope affixed to, by the way?

03:04:23.324 --> 03:04:24.440
Now that you all have--

03:04:24.440 --> 03:04:25.523
LIAM: Just Yasha.
MATT: -- crawled into it.

03:04:25.523 --> 03:04:27.662
So Yasha, you're the last one holding it?

03:04:27.662 --> 03:04:28.795
So you're holding the rope for now

03:04:28.795 --> 03:04:30.285
it is like three or four people dangling

03:04:30.285 --> 03:04:31.895
from it where you turn into an owl

03:04:31.895 --> 03:04:33.125
and begin to carry people down.

03:04:33.125 --> 03:04:34.358
LAURA: Yeah. And then--

03:04:34.358 --> 03:04:36.642
LIAM: Yeah, one at a time for Fjord and Caduceus.

03:04:36.642 --> 03:04:39.155
And that just leaves me flying beneath the hole

03:04:39.155 --> 03:04:41.695
in the ceiling and going for the slip and slide.

03:04:41.695 --> 03:04:42.528
ASHLEY: Yeah.

03:04:42.528 --> 03:04:45.319
LAURA: I guess I got help, too, because I was just dangling

03:04:45.319 --> 03:04:46.968
from the rope this whole time.
LIAM: No, I let you fall.

03:04:46.968 --> 03:04:49.907
MATT: Okay. So you do notice--
LIAM: I thought she went down already.

03:04:49.907 --> 03:04:51.345
MATT: -- the rope is no longer holding any weight.

03:04:51.345 --> 03:04:54.535
It is free of anybody else, it seems.

03:04:54.535 --> 03:04:55.865
What would you like to do?

03:04:55.865 --> 03:04:58.335
ASHLEY: Okay, can I try to cover up the hole

03:04:58.335 --> 03:05:01.265
that we're in with, like, a table or something?

03:05:01.265 --> 03:05:02.695
MATT: Correct. Are you taking the rope up,

03:05:02.695 --> 03:05:06.117
or are you anchoring it to something?

03:05:06.117 --> 03:05:07.655
ASHLEY: I'm going to take the rope up.

03:05:07.655 --> 03:05:10.745
MATT: Okay. So you pull the rope back up
and you pack it away.

03:05:10.745 --> 03:05:13.095
ASHLEY: Yeah. And then sort of try to get...

03:05:15.375 --> 03:05:17.805
MATT: There's plenty of debris here to pull and try and,

03:05:17.805 --> 03:05:18.855
you know--
LAURA: Yeah.

03:05:18.855 --> 03:05:20.055
MATT: -- wedge into that space a bit.

03:05:20.055 --> 03:05:21.270
ASHLEY: Cover it up, yeah.

03:05:21.270 --> 03:05:22.385
MATT: Pardon, yeah.
LAURA: As you like--

03:05:22.385 --> 03:05:23.964
ASHLEY: And then--
LAURA: -- fall down the hole.

03:05:23.964 --> 03:05:24.835
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's okay.

03:05:24.835 --> 03:05:27.976
I'm going to start shimmying down the hole.

03:05:27.976 --> 03:05:29.455
MATT: Okay.

03:05:29.455 --> 03:05:30.945
It is a tight enough space to the point

03:05:30.945 --> 03:05:33.538
where you have a little more resistance than most would.

03:05:34.765 --> 03:05:36.825
I will say, because this is--

03:05:37.775 --> 03:05:41.202
Roll an athletics and/or acrobatics check on this one.

03:05:41.202 --> 03:05:42.035
ASHLEY: Okay.

03:05:44.770 --> 03:05:46.003
Natural 20.

03:05:46.003 --> 03:05:47.661
TRAVIS: Oh yeah.
MATT: Without issue.

03:05:47.661 --> 03:05:52.418
We're like-- this is like a reverse Bishop in Aliens.

03:05:52.418 --> 03:05:53.635
Where you're in that tight space

03:05:53.635 --> 03:05:55.895
and just working your way down as you go.

03:05:55.895 --> 03:05:58.305
About 70 or so feet before you begin to look over

03:05:58.305 --> 03:06:02.635
and you can see where the duct comes to an end abruptly

03:06:02.635 --> 03:06:04.265
and where that opening space is.

03:06:04.265 --> 03:06:06.695
And as you get towards it, you're able to wedge your arms

03:06:06.695 --> 03:06:09.172
on the side and glance over and you can see below

03:06:09.172 --> 03:06:10.475
(fluttering)

03:06:10.475 --> 03:06:14.035
the flying owl that is Caleb.

03:06:14.035 --> 03:06:16.185
ASHLEY: Psst. (hooting)

03:06:16.185 --> 03:06:17.018
LIAM: (hooting)

03:06:18.725 --> 03:06:20.035
ASHLEY: Ready?

03:06:20.035 --> 03:06:20.868
LIAM: (hooting)

03:06:23.506 --> 03:06:25.335
MATT: It's a heavy impact for you,

03:06:25.335 --> 03:06:28.588
but you manage to right yourself for the most part.

03:06:29.425 --> 03:06:32.092
LIAM: (panting)

03:06:33.257 --> 03:06:34.127
MATT: All right.

03:06:34.127 --> 03:06:36.765
With that, you've all been lowered down into the trees

03:06:36.765 --> 03:06:38.925
and you all begin to slowly climb down to meet,

03:06:38.925 --> 03:06:42.195
I assume on the bottom, beneath the canopy

03:06:42.195 --> 03:06:43.745
or are you staying in the tree?

03:06:44.855 --> 03:06:46.755
LAURA: Well, they're already at the bottom.

03:06:49.665 --> 03:06:50.655
I assume the bottom.

03:06:50.655 --> 03:06:51.488
MATT: Okay.

03:06:51.488 --> 03:06:53.895
SAM: Come on down, guys, we're all here waiting.

03:06:53.895 --> 03:06:54.775
ASHLEY: Climbing down.
TALIESIN: All right.

03:06:54.775 --> 03:06:55.608
MATT: So you all climb down.

03:06:55.608 --> 03:06:56.849
Do you revert form?
LIAM: I think I'll stay

03:06:56.849 --> 03:06:58.175
in the branches above them.

03:06:58.175 --> 03:06:59.375
MATT: Okay.
LIAM: For the moment.

03:06:59.375 --> 03:07:01.405
MATT: So you stay just flying in the space here,

03:07:01.405 --> 03:07:03.565
and as you like fly around,

03:07:03.565 --> 03:07:04.945
you get a view of the space.

03:07:04.945 --> 03:07:08.275
The chamber is over a hundred feet tall.

03:07:08.275 --> 03:07:11.265
And as you begin to peruse and scan the tops

03:07:11.265 --> 03:07:16.265
of this strange, man-made, subterranean, now arboretum,

03:07:16.666 --> 03:07:18.065
hundreds of feet from side to side,

03:07:18.065 --> 03:07:20.155
probably anywhere from 250 to 300 feet

03:07:20.155 --> 03:07:21.895
from one end to the other, but it is this

03:07:21.895 --> 03:07:24.468
gradual domed arboretum-like chamber,

03:07:24.468 --> 03:07:27.858
a contained interior forest.

03:07:32.315 --> 03:07:36.235
Caduceus, what catches you odd

03:07:36.235 --> 03:07:39.785
and makes you feel the shiver down your spine

03:07:39.785 --> 03:07:42.087
as you climb through this tree,

03:07:42.087 --> 03:07:44.344
is the way that it's twisting,

03:07:44.344 --> 03:07:48.662
the coloration of the leaves and the branches:

03:07:49.755 --> 03:07:51.925
Very reminiscent of the Savalirwood,

03:07:51.925 --> 03:07:54.981
specifically the corrupted portions of it.

03:07:56.046 --> 03:07:59.405
It's oddly welcoming because it reminds you of home,

03:07:59.405 --> 03:08:02.152
but it's the least--

03:08:02.152 --> 03:08:04.235
the least thing you would expect this far from it.

03:08:04.235 --> 03:08:05.605
TALIESIN: And it's the worst thing to see, right?

03:08:05.605 --> 03:08:07.035
The worst part of home to see right now.

03:08:07.035 --> 03:08:07.868
MATT: Yeah.

03:08:11.575 --> 03:08:12.918
TALIESIN: We've seen this before.

03:08:15.115 --> 03:08:16.173
TRAVIS: Where?

03:08:16.173 --> 03:08:17.340
TALIESIN: Savalirwood.

03:08:18.385 --> 03:08:19.510
MARISHA: Your home?

03:08:21.315 --> 03:08:23.931
TALIESIN: It's so similar,

03:08:23.931 --> 03:08:27.255
but something's very wrong.

03:08:27.255 --> 03:08:28.088
They're dead, right?

03:08:28.088 --> 03:08:29.858
These things are just fucking dead.

03:08:30.985 --> 03:08:33.876
MATT: If you want to try and inspect,

03:08:33.876 --> 03:08:35.846
could make a nature check.

03:08:35.846 --> 03:08:37.635
TALIESIN: Why a nature check, damn it?

03:08:37.635 --> 03:08:39.688
MATT: Because this is understanding of nature.

03:08:41.055 --> 03:08:43.265
TALIESIN: I'll wait. It's just freaking me out.

03:08:45.665 --> 03:08:47.015
Until we're on the other side.

03:08:47.915 --> 03:08:48.925
MATT: Okay.

03:08:48.925 --> 03:08:51.296
TALIESIN: Stuff's just hitting me wrong.

03:08:51.296 --> 03:08:53.489
LAURA: Do you want me to try to talk to them?

03:08:53.489 --> 03:08:55.847
TALIESIN: No, not yet.

03:08:55.847 --> 03:08:57.043
MARISHA: What is it?

03:09:00.320 --> 03:09:02.965
TALIESIN: It's just-- This is just casting a shadow on me.

03:09:02.965 --> 03:09:06.525
I'm not ready to look at this yet.

03:09:06.525 --> 03:09:08.025
Let's get a little further in.

03:09:11.365 --> 03:09:14.802
MATT: Okay. You all, except for Caleb,

03:09:14.802 --> 03:09:16.868
gather at the base of the tree

03:09:16.868 --> 03:09:19.001
and you now stand in the midst of this

03:09:19.001 --> 03:09:21.884
lightless, oddly level forest.

03:09:23.565 --> 03:09:27.005
You can see quite a bit ahead as the canopy ends anywhere

03:09:27.005 --> 03:09:30.185
between eight to 10 feet above you, and since

03:09:30.185 --> 03:09:32.945
it is a level field, aside from the occasional

03:09:32.945 --> 03:09:36.985
or the eventual blockade of overlapping trunks,

03:09:36.985 --> 03:09:38.585
it just looks like an endless row

03:09:38.585 --> 03:09:41.535
of semi-natural columns that themselves warp

03:09:41.535 --> 03:09:43.555
and twist a bit before they climb up

03:09:43.555 --> 03:09:46.658
into the cluster of branches and leaves.

03:09:47.655 --> 03:09:50.922
Your feet hitting the floor has a soft spongy feel almost

03:09:50.922 --> 03:09:53.955
as you step across the underbrush.

03:09:53.955 --> 03:09:56.475
You feel the cracks of fallen branches

03:09:56.475 --> 03:10:01.475
and twigs of long-dried and partially decayed vegetation.

03:10:01.605 --> 03:10:04.095
But you sense the decay here is somewhat stunted.

03:10:04.095 --> 03:10:07.455
There isn't enough moisture and enough specific nutrients

03:10:07.455 --> 03:10:12.450
to maintain the sort of fungus or continued cycle of

03:10:12.450 --> 03:10:14.995
decomposition, which sets you off as well.

03:10:14.995 --> 03:10:16.148
TALIESIN: Detect Undead.

03:10:17.755 --> 03:10:19.230
MATT: No undead.
TALIESIN: All right.

03:10:19.230 --> 03:10:21.588
MATT: Which brings you some comfort.

03:10:21.588 --> 03:10:23.854
Glancing about, there are a lot of elements of this,

03:10:23.854 --> 03:10:26.885
the layer of the trees, the shape they're taking.

03:10:26.885 --> 03:10:30.318
It feels like you're in a

03:10:30.318 --> 03:10:32.931
weird parallel version of the Savalirwood.

03:10:34.905 --> 03:10:37.905
TALIESIN: I know it's about 300 feet, how far?

03:10:37.905 --> 03:10:39.185
I figure like three quarters into it,

03:10:39.185 --> 03:10:40.575
I'll try and talk to one of these.

03:10:40.575 --> 03:10:41.535
MATT: Which direction are you guys going?

03:10:41.535 --> 03:10:42.835
You're in the center of the chamber,

03:10:42.835 --> 03:10:45.055
of a large circular room.
TRAVIS: Wait, it's dark, right?

03:10:45.055 --> 03:10:46.148
LAURA: I can cast--

03:10:47.355 --> 03:10:48.575
Yes, it's very dark.

03:10:48.575 --> 03:10:49.408
TRAVIS: Let's light it up.

03:10:49.408 --> 03:10:50.859
TALIESIN: I've got a little light going on.

03:10:50.859 --> 03:10:51.692
MATT: Okay.

03:10:55.525 --> 03:10:59.985
LAURA: Can I cast Locate Object at a higher level?

03:10:59.985 --> 03:11:01.525
MATT: Yeah. You can cast any spell at a higher level.

03:11:01.525 --> 03:11:04.143
It doesn't necessarily mean it has a higher effect,

03:11:04.143 --> 03:11:05.395
but you can burn the spell slot

03:11:05.395 --> 03:11:07.765
to still use a lower level spell.

03:11:07.765 --> 03:11:09.235
LAURA: Yeah, I'll try. I'll do another one.

03:11:09.235 --> 03:11:13.035
Fuck, I'm using a lot, but I'll do another Locate Object.

03:11:13.035 --> 03:11:17.055
MATT: Okay. Closing your eyes and concentrating you--

03:11:17.055 --> 03:11:19.765
Between the darkness that is your closed eyelids,

03:11:19.765 --> 03:11:22.975
you see that green glow of the Traveler's presence

03:11:22.975 --> 03:11:27.673
begin to swerve and then draw your attention

03:11:27.673 --> 03:11:29.375
off the right-hand side of the path

03:11:29.375 --> 03:11:30.835
you guys were traveling.

03:11:30.835 --> 03:11:32.775
And as soon as you glance over, and open your eyes,

03:11:32.775 --> 03:11:34.575
you can see that green glow has become a faint blue.

03:11:34.575 --> 03:11:36.505
And you know that direction is tugging you

03:11:36.505 --> 03:11:39.435
towards the threshold crest that you were seeking.

03:11:39.435 --> 03:11:40.832
LAURA: It's over there.

03:11:40.832 --> 03:11:42.303
SAM: Let's go.

03:11:44.378 --> 03:11:48.422
MATT: All right. Are you all traveling standard speed?

03:11:48.422 --> 03:11:49.255
SAM: Stealthily.

03:11:49.255 --> 03:11:50.088
MATT: Stealthily?

03:11:50.088 --> 03:11:52.505
All right. Everyone make a group stealth check for me.

03:11:54.096 --> 03:11:56.258
LAURA: Blessing of the Trickster--
MATT: Except for Caleb, who is flying around.

03:11:56.258 --> 03:11:57.760
LAURA: -- to Fjord.

03:11:57.760 --> 03:11:58.668
TRAVIS: What does that give me?

03:11:58.668 --> 03:12:00.365
LAURA: Advantage on stealth rolls.
TRAVIS: Thank.

03:12:02.869 --> 03:12:06.332
LIAM: Is the tree cover too thick to be flying

03:12:06.332 --> 03:12:07.595
like 20 or 30 feet above

03:12:07.595 --> 03:12:09.245
or would I just be in the branches?

03:12:09.245 --> 03:12:10.315
MATT: You would just be in the branches at that point.

03:12:10.315 --> 03:12:12.685
It is-- All the trees are...

03:12:13.705 --> 03:12:15.305
And it's odd, the more you look at it,

03:12:15.305 --> 03:12:17.875
their pattern of placement is not random

03:12:17.875 --> 03:12:18.875
like a normal forest.

03:12:18.875 --> 03:12:20.785
It is geometric.

03:12:20.785 --> 03:12:25.388
They are all spaced intentionally from each other.

03:12:26.975 --> 03:12:29.415
So their canopies all collide pretty intensely.

03:12:29.415 --> 03:12:30.845
LIAM: Okay.
TRAVIS: 14.

03:12:30.845 --> 03:12:33.651
MATT: 14. Jester?
LIAM: All right, I'll drop it.

03:12:33.651 --> 03:12:35.421
LAURA: Eight.
MATT: Eight.

03:12:35.421 --> 03:12:36.589
SAM: 25.

03:12:36.589 --> 03:12:37.685
ASHLEY: 23.

03:12:37.685 --> 03:12:38.625
TALIESIN: 20.

03:12:38.625 --> 03:12:39.615
MARISHA: 20.

03:12:39.615 --> 03:12:41.555
LIAM: 20.
MATT: Okay. Okay.

03:12:41.555 --> 03:12:43.995
So eventually Caleb catches up with you

03:12:43.995 --> 03:12:47.025
and you all together began quietly, slowly,

03:12:47.025 --> 03:12:49.265
but quietly making your way in the direction

03:12:49.265 --> 03:12:50.415
that Jester is leading.

03:12:51.585 --> 03:12:54.087
Moving through, looking from right to left

03:12:54.087 --> 03:12:56.235
because of that odd geometric placement,

03:12:56.235 --> 03:13:01.095
it does feel like intentional columns,

03:13:01.095 --> 03:13:04.038
to a certain degree, because of that continued pattern.

03:13:05.315 --> 03:13:08.068
As you maneuver and keeping your eyes peeled,

03:13:09.115 --> 03:13:10.658
nothing else seems to move.

03:13:12.045 --> 03:13:14.385
No other sounds beyond the crunching of your feet,

03:13:14.385 --> 03:13:15.818
even as careful as you are,

03:13:16.805 --> 03:13:19.388
pressing forward into this dark expanse.

03:13:21.315 --> 03:13:26.065
After a bit of travel, you begin to see the far walls

03:13:26.065 --> 03:13:28.395
of this arboretum begin to approach.

03:13:28.395 --> 03:13:30.956
There in the stone, you can see these carved arches

03:13:30.956 --> 03:13:34.515
that are more just there for design purposes,

03:13:34.515 --> 03:13:36.815
but one of these arches is open.

03:13:36.815 --> 03:13:40.015
It is a hallway entrance.

03:13:40.015 --> 03:13:43.015
And you know this to be the likely direction

03:13:43.015 --> 03:13:43.915
you should travel.

03:13:45.309 --> 03:13:47.955
This hall is two by two.

03:13:47.955 --> 03:13:51.055
So you would have to travel in pairs.

03:13:51.055 --> 03:13:54.345
Who would be the first pair in this marching order?

03:13:54.345 --> 03:13:56.995
LIAM: Is there no writing on the outside of this archway?

03:13:58.555 --> 03:14:00.315
MATT: There would be writing. Do you still have--

03:14:00.315 --> 03:14:02.725
LIAM: It lasts an hour, so I'd have 30 or 40 minutes left.

03:14:02.725 --> 03:14:03.825
MATT: Right. And it's not concentration, correct?

03:14:03.825 --> 03:14:05.767
LIAM: No.
MATT: So yeah. You read it.

03:14:05.767 --> 03:14:07.267
It reads "Threshold Vault."

03:14:08.205 --> 03:14:10.216
MARISHA: Threshold Vaults.
SAM: Pretty clear.

03:14:10.216 --> 03:14:11.515
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:14:11.515 --> 03:14:13.418
TRAVIS: Maybe vault means lounge.

03:14:15.369 --> 03:14:16.882
SAM: ♪ Two by two! ♪

03:14:16.882 --> 03:14:18.677
LAURA: Caduceus, have you ever tried talking

03:14:18.677 --> 03:14:22.015
to the corrupted plants in the Savalir?

03:14:22.015 --> 03:14:26.755
TALIESIN: No, I... I think I'll

03:14:26.755 --> 03:14:29.235
I'll try once we're all in the tunnel.

03:14:29.235 --> 03:14:31.055
LAURA: Okay.
TALIESIN: I'm worried.

03:14:31.055 --> 03:14:33.258
LAURA: Do you want me to try, too?

03:14:34.147 --> 03:14:37.085
TALIESIN: If you could be there as well,
that might be a good idea.

03:14:37.085 --> 03:14:38.315
LAURA: Okay.

03:14:38.315 --> 03:14:40.315
MARISHA: Why did you never try talking to them?

03:14:41.255 --> 03:14:42.645
TALIESIN: I don't know.

03:14:44.345 --> 03:14:45.695
Things are different now.

03:14:48.295 --> 03:14:49.585
Once everybody's in--

03:14:49.585 --> 03:14:50.535
TRAVIS: We're here, yeah.

03:14:52.063 --> 03:14:53.613
TALIESIN: I'm not touching them, either.

03:14:55.035 --> 03:14:59.385
If you can hear me, I am so sorry.

03:14:59.385 --> 03:15:02.088
And if we can help,

03:15:06.415 --> 03:15:07.248
we will.

03:15:10.265 --> 03:15:15.176
LAURA: I'm going to cast
Speak with Plants from the necklace.

03:15:15.176 --> 03:15:17.884
LAURA: I'm going to cast
Speak with Plants from the necklace.

03:15:17.884 --> 03:15:18.717
MATT: Okay.

03:15:18.717 --> 03:15:21.325
LAURA: And see if we can hear anything back.

03:15:21.325 --> 03:15:24.918
I'll just reiterate what Caduceus said as well.

03:15:25.839 --> 03:15:26.672
MATT: Okay.

03:15:28.217 --> 03:15:32.095
You convey this message to what you think

03:15:33.595 --> 03:15:36.958
is likely going to be nothing to respond.

03:15:39.425 --> 03:15:42.127
But as you speak to the first tree,

03:15:42.127 --> 03:15:44.395
you sense a fragment of his essence

03:15:44.395 --> 03:15:46.328
reach out back to you in return.

03:15:47.555 --> 03:15:52.505
And while, much like the language of trees are wordless

03:15:53.545 --> 03:15:58.535
and but a series of slow emotions and thought,

03:15:58.535 --> 03:15:59.368
and but a series of slow emotions and thought,

03:16:00.205 --> 03:16:05.047
this comes to you nothing but
malevolent hunger, and desperation.

03:16:05.047 --> 03:16:06.430
this comes to you nothing but
malevolent hunger, and desperation.

03:16:07.445 --> 03:16:12.445
It reaches towards you, and it's like pulling your hand back

03:16:12.565 --> 03:16:16.505
from a hole filled with insects.

03:16:16.505 --> 03:16:18.915
You are repulsed by the emotion

03:16:18.915 --> 03:16:20.065
that tries to connect to you.

03:16:20.065 --> 03:16:22.795
This (wheezing)

03:16:23.985 --> 03:16:26.965
And as you withdraw, you almost like

03:16:26.965 --> 03:16:28.995
slap the pouch away that you utilized

03:16:28.995 --> 03:16:30.668
to make this connection.

03:16:32.465 --> 03:16:34.035
There is still life in these trees,

03:16:34.035 --> 03:16:36.095
though nowhere near the semblance

03:16:36.095 --> 03:16:37.695
that you've grown accustomed to.

03:16:40.195 --> 03:16:44.155
TALIESIN: No, let's... We're done.

03:16:44.155 --> 03:16:48.155
Let's move. That's enough.

03:16:48.155 --> 03:16:50.615
LIAM: I'm going to quietly nudge my way to the front

03:16:50.615 --> 03:16:52.417
if we're going into this tunnel.

03:16:52.417 --> 03:16:54.715
I'm going to throw up Detect Magic

03:16:54.715 --> 03:16:56.425
with Comprehend Languages still going

03:16:56.425 --> 03:16:58.045
because both can be happening,

03:16:58.045 --> 03:17:00.312
and I'm going to apparate Frumpkin down in front of me

03:17:00.312 --> 03:17:03.975
and say: Just 20 feet up, quiet as you can.

03:17:03.975 --> 03:17:05.265
MATT: Got it. All right.

03:17:05.265 --> 03:17:06.865
Who's with Caleb at the front?

03:17:07.715 --> 03:17:08.875
TRAVIS: I'll go with Caleb at the front.

03:17:08.875 --> 03:17:10.495
MATT: All right. You got Fjord and Caleb.

03:17:10.495 --> 03:17:11.345
Who's after them?

03:17:13.145 --> 03:17:14.595
SAM: Should have Jester close to the front

03:17:14.595 --> 03:17:16.144
so she can point the way?

03:17:16.144 --> 03:17:17.135
Right?
LAURA: Sure. Yeah,

03:17:17.135 --> 03:17:17.995
I'll go behind them.

03:17:17.995 --> 03:17:20.385
MATT: Okay. And who's next to Jester?

03:17:20.385 --> 03:17:22.705
SAM: I'll go next to Jester to protect her.

03:17:22.705 --> 03:17:24.708
MATT: All right.
LAURA: Thank you, Veth.

03:17:24.708 --> 03:17:25.875
MATT: And then Caduceus would be in the rear,

03:17:25.875 --> 03:17:27.675
so probably would Beau and Yasha after that.

03:17:27.675 --> 03:17:29.779
SAM: Unless, Fjord, you'd like to.

03:17:29.779 --> 03:17:31.655
TALIESIN: I'll be keeping an eye behind us.

03:17:31.655 --> 03:17:32.855
MATT: Okay.

03:17:32.855 --> 03:17:34.655
LIAM: Caleb's eyes are just wide as saucers

03:17:34.655 --> 03:17:39.655
trying to see any writing, any arcane sigilry

03:17:39.685 --> 03:17:42.155
anything that is bad for us.

03:17:42.155 --> 03:17:47.005
MATT: So. Different from the metallic rectangular hallways

03:17:47.005 --> 03:17:49.735
that you traveled through by the laboratories,

03:17:49.735 --> 03:17:54.495
down here, the hallway has a natural stone feel.

03:17:54.495 --> 03:17:57.495
It has a simple elven flair

03:17:57.495 --> 03:18:02.495
to its curved arched ceiling above you.

03:18:02.545 --> 03:18:04.885
And occasionally it's segmented with

03:18:04.885 --> 03:18:08.595
a decorative rib that travels

03:18:08.595 --> 03:18:10.695
from side to side over top.

03:18:10.695 --> 03:18:14.225
This area seems to carry a little more

03:18:14.225 --> 03:18:18.179
of an aesthetically pleasing presence.

03:18:18.179 --> 03:18:20.195
of an aesthetically pleasing presence.

03:18:21.285 --> 03:18:25.567
This hall, as you step into the cold marble floor echoes.

03:18:25.567 --> 03:18:27.975
(footsteps)

03:18:27.975 --> 03:18:31.525
You instinctually keep quiet
and be careful, keeping eyes out.

03:18:31.525 --> 03:18:34.125
You don't see any writing. You don't see any labels.

03:18:35.555 --> 03:18:39.035
A little ways ahead, you begin to see a T-intersection

03:18:39.035 --> 03:18:42.145
where another hall intersects with this.

03:18:42.145 --> 03:18:44.615
And as this hall continues onward,

03:18:44.615 --> 03:18:47.615
you can see a set of stairs that descends.

03:18:47.615 --> 03:18:49.675
And since it is lightless beyond the light that you carry

03:18:49.675 --> 03:18:51.025
with you into this chamber,

03:18:52.135 --> 03:18:57.008
Caduceus, you do see a faint, familiar blue glow,

03:18:58.005 --> 03:19:01.168
barely visible just beyond the stairway ahead of you.

03:19:04.327 --> 03:19:05.285
TALIESIN: There you go.

03:19:07.016 --> 03:19:08.935
TRAVIS: And the stairway is beyond the intersection?

03:19:08.935 --> 03:19:10.075
MATT: Correct.

03:19:10.075 --> 03:19:12.745
LIAM: So there's a left and a right, but we can pass that.

03:19:12.745 --> 03:19:13.622
MATT: Yes.
LIAM: Towards stairs, okay.

03:19:13.622 --> 03:19:16.790
LAURA: And my spell is guiding us--

03:19:16.790 --> 03:19:18.645
MATT: Guiding you across and down the stairs.

03:19:18.645 --> 03:19:20.205
LAURA: Okay.

03:19:20.205 --> 03:19:22.255
TALIESIN: Careful for traps.

03:19:22.255 --> 03:19:24.425
LIAM: I place my hand on Fjord's shoulder

03:19:24.425 --> 03:19:26.454
and go into Frumpkin's vision.

03:19:26.454 --> 03:19:28.655
And just have Frumpkin (footsteps)

03:19:28.655 --> 03:19:31.015
up to the intersection and look both ways.

03:19:31.015 --> 03:19:34.185
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll perception for Frumpkin.

03:19:34.185 --> 03:19:35.845
TRAVIS: Come on.
LIAM: Just look, cat!

03:19:35.845 --> 03:19:36.678
Just look!

03:19:38.875 --> 03:19:42.525
That is a 13.

03:19:42.525 --> 03:19:44.855
MATT: 13. Don't see anything one way or the other.

03:19:44.855 --> 03:19:46.195
LIAM: Okay.

03:19:46.195 --> 03:19:47.028
TRAVIS: Just darkness?

03:19:47.995 --> 03:19:48.828
MATT: Just darkness.

03:19:51.137 --> 03:19:52.570
LIAM: Okay. So far, so good.

03:19:53.846 --> 03:19:56.405
LAURA: And you saw the blue light down?

03:19:56.405 --> 03:19:57.238
LIAM: Yeah.

03:19:57.238 --> 03:19:58.845
MATT: Yeah, so there's the intersection straight ahead,

03:19:58.845 --> 03:20:01.205
and the stairs descend downward and you see a faint,

03:20:01.205 --> 03:20:02.805
a little bit of blue light coming up

03:20:02.805 --> 03:20:04.370
from beyond the stairs.

03:20:04.370 --> 03:20:05.365
TALIESIN: We're both on track.

03:20:05.365 --> 03:20:06.372
LAURA: Okay.

03:20:06.372 --> 03:20:09.338
TRAVIS: And as Caleb and I come up to that intersection--

03:20:09.338 --> 03:20:11.325
MATT: Does Frumpkin traverse the intersection?

03:20:11.325 --> 03:20:12.691
LIAM: No. Waits there.

03:20:12.691 --> 03:20:14.350
MATT: Okay. So Frumpkin just waits there.

03:20:14.350 --> 03:20:16.595
LIAM: You want to look right, I'll look left?

03:20:16.595 --> 03:20:18.763
TRAVIS: Sure.
LIAM: Okay.

03:20:18.763 --> 03:20:21.101
We have better investigation than Frumpkin,

03:20:21.101 --> 03:20:24.705
so I'm going to look up the left hallway here.
TRAVIS: Yeah, we do like the one eye.

03:20:24.705 --> 03:20:25.735
LIAM: Yeah.

03:20:25.735 --> 03:20:27.870
TRAVIS: Around the barrier, slicing the pie.

03:20:27.870 --> 03:20:29.815
LIAM: Detect Magic still up, writing, all that.

03:20:29.815 --> 03:20:31.428
MATT: Right, yeah.

03:20:31.428 --> 03:20:35.735
Detect Magic. As you approach towards that intersection,

03:20:35.735 --> 03:20:39.035
you sense a faint magical barrier

03:20:39.035 --> 03:20:41.235
that can entirely encompasses

03:20:41.235 --> 03:20:43.385
that T-section hallway ahead of you.

03:20:43.385 --> 03:20:47.271
LIAM: Okay. So before we even get there
that I catch that vibe.

03:20:47.271 --> 03:20:48.628
MATT: Mm-hmm.
LIAM: Okay.

03:20:50.630 --> 03:20:53.858
Is there a school connected to it?

03:20:54.875 --> 03:20:56.616
MATT: This would also be Abjuration.

03:20:56.616 --> 03:20:57.449
LIAM: Okay.

03:20:59.168 --> 03:21:01.665
MATT: I imagine so; let me double check.

03:21:01.665 --> 03:21:03.565
SAM: So, like, we can't go forward?

03:21:03.565 --> 03:21:06.025
LIAM: Well, something will happen.

03:21:06.025 --> 03:21:07.288
SAM: Oh.

03:21:07.288 --> 03:21:08.825
TALIESIN: Is there are Dispel Magic in the house?

03:21:08.825 --> 03:21:10.965
LIAM: Yeah, there is.

03:21:10.965 --> 03:21:12.935
MATT: Sorry, Evocation is what you would get from this.

03:21:12.935 --> 03:21:14.986
LIAM: Evocation? Even better.

03:21:19.245 --> 03:21:22.438
I will cast Dispel at 4th-level.

03:21:23.515 --> 03:21:26.525
MATT: At 4th-level. Okay.

03:21:26.525 --> 03:21:30.495
Go ahead and roll a d10 and add your intelligence modifier.

03:21:30.495 --> 03:21:32.366
LIAM: D... d10?

03:21:32.366 --> 03:21:34.383
MATT: Sorry, d20 (blows raspberry).

03:21:40.015 --> 03:21:42.385
LIAM: Total of 16.

03:21:42.385 --> 03:21:43.218
MATT: 16.

03:21:44.225 --> 03:21:45.175
As you concentrate,

03:21:46.585 --> 03:21:50.575
try your best to extend your intellect to unravel

03:21:50.575 --> 03:21:54.392
whatever weave holds this barrier ahead of you.

03:21:56.735 --> 03:21:58.615
Inspirational cleverness hits your mind

03:21:58.615 --> 03:22:03.135
and you envision anchor points beyond this intersection,

03:22:03.135 --> 03:22:05.055
hoping this wall is not infinite,

03:22:05.055 --> 03:22:06.555
and if there are anchor points,

03:22:06.555 --> 03:22:07.895
it means there's a weakness where the two meet,

03:22:07.895 --> 03:22:08.985
and that's what holds this wall in place.

03:22:08.985 --> 03:22:10.535
As you release the Dispel Magic,

03:22:10.535 --> 03:22:12.935
you watch as the barrier vanishes ahead.

03:22:12.935 --> 03:22:14.948
SAM: Cool. Nice.

03:22:16.412 --> 03:22:17.245
MARISHA: Okay.

03:22:17.245 --> 03:22:18.221
SAM: Excellent.
TRAVIS: Well done.

03:22:18.221 --> 03:22:19.679
LAURA: Nice, Caleb.
LIAM: Okay.

03:22:19.679 --> 03:22:22.562
Inch a little closer and do what we planned?

03:22:22.562 --> 03:22:23.795
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.
LIAM: Okay.

03:22:23.795 --> 03:22:25.653
LAURA: ♪ Inch a little closer ♪

03:22:25.653 --> 03:22:27.619
TRAVIS: I'll actually summon the sword as well and

03:22:27.619 --> 03:22:29.495
(whooshing) kick it off.

03:22:29.495 --> 03:22:31.465
MATT: The light glows now. You have multiple light sources

03:22:31.465 --> 03:22:33.685
helping even further your vision in this space.

03:22:33.685 --> 03:22:35.225
And now that you have more light and you glance up,

03:22:35.225 --> 03:22:36.805
you can see the heavy cracks that run

03:22:36.805 --> 03:22:39.555
through the stonework of this hallway.

03:22:39.555 --> 03:22:42.475
Everything here, even in its beauty, still has sustained

03:22:42.475 --> 03:22:46.505
severe structural damage from the impact of Aeor long ago.

03:22:46.505 --> 03:22:50.535
And now that you have that visual perspective

03:22:50.535 --> 03:22:53.395
with your sword now lighting it up even further,

03:22:53.395 --> 03:22:57.135
further instills the question of just how well

03:22:57.135 --> 03:22:59.325
this all will continue to stand and for how long.

03:22:59.325 --> 03:23:00.615
TRAVIS: Hmm.
MATT: But--

03:23:00.615 --> 03:23:01.955
MARISHA: And we're just still in the hallway.

03:23:01.955 --> 03:23:03.535
No chambers, just--

03:23:03.535 --> 03:23:05.261
MATT: Just a long hallway.
LIAM: Left and right.

03:23:05.261 --> 03:23:06.457
And forward and down.

03:23:06.457 --> 03:23:07.779
MARISHA: And forward and down, right.
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're doing the--

03:23:07.779 --> 03:23:09.109
LIAM: Fjord and Caleb are going to do--

03:23:09.109 --> 03:23:10.367
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're going to slice the pie.

03:23:10.367 --> 03:23:11.678
MATT: You're getting the sense

03:23:11.678 --> 03:23:15.005
that a lot of this city, at least the areas you've seen,

03:23:15.005 --> 03:23:18.605
have had open, open regions,

03:23:18.605 --> 03:23:22.388
but the open regions have been buried and covered

03:23:22.388 --> 03:23:25.985
and so what remains are enclosed chambers

03:23:25.985 --> 03:23:27.365
and the halls that connect them.

03:23:27.365 --> 03:23:32.174
So what's left is this odd labyrinth of things that have--

03:23:32.174 --> 03:23:36.739
structures and chambers that have
resisted the weight and test of time.

03:23:39.405 --> 03:23:41.378
So you approach the intersection.

03:23:43.045 --> 03:23:45.385
You cross, there's no barrier, no issue.

03:23:46.405 --> 03:23:48.518
TRAVIS: Is it just darkness in each direction?

03:23:48.518 --> 03:23:49.968
MATT: Darkness in each direction.

03:23:51.025 --> 03:23:53.598
TRAVIS: How far can your globules go?

03:23:54.946 --> 03:23:57.938
LIAM: Well. Well, well, well.

03:23:57.938 --> 03:24:02.938
If I do globules, I can't sense any magical threats.

03:24:03.305 --> 03:24:05.146
I will lose one so.
TRAVIS: I could just

03:24:05.146 --> 03:24:07.564
(whooshing) one in each direction.
SAM: Sure.

03:24:07.564 --> 03:24:09.153
TALIESIN: Between the two of us, we should be fine.

03:24:09.153 --> 03:24:12.550
ASHLEY: Hey, um. I can make light.

03:24:12.550 --> 03:24:14.100
SAM: What?!

03:24:16.335 --> 03:24:18.421
Let's see it.
TALIESIN: Prove it.

03:24:18.421 --> 03:24:20.623
(laughter)

03:24:20.623 --> 03:24:21.548
ASHLEY: Foom!

03:24:23.690 --> 03:24:25.518
TALIESIN: Where have you been keeping that?

03:24:25.518 --> 03:24:27.417
ASHLEY: I just realized I had it.

03:24:27.417 --> 03:24:30.094
(laughter)

03:24:30.094 --> 03:24:32.242
I was like, "Am I looking at this correctly?"

03:24:32.242 --> 03:24:34.320
MATT: Yeah, that's right.
ASHLEY: It just says--

03:24:34.320 --> 03:24:36.538
LAURA: You have Light? You have the Light cantrip?

03:24:36.538 --> 03:24:38.097
ASHLEY: Yeah. I have the Light cantrip.

03:24:38.097 --> 03:24:40.346
MATT: As part of being aasimar.

03:24:40.346 --> 03:24:44.602
ASHLEY: Not sure how I missed that this whole campaign.

03:24:44.602 --> 03:24:45.818
TRAVIS: Awesome.
MATT: I always figured--

03:24:45.818 --> 03:24:47.124
TALIESIN: You can like pop it on anything.

03:24:47.124 --> 03:24:48.061
ASHLEY: I can pop it on something?

03:24:48.061 --> 03:24:49.094
MATT: On objects, yeah.

03:24:49.094 --> 03:24:51.869
Like glove, or your sword, or something like that.

03:24:51.869 --> 03:24:53.118
MARISHA: Comes with the textbook.

03:24:53.118 --> 03:24:54.785
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll pop it at the end of my sword.

03:24:54.785 --> 03:24:56.935
MATT: All right. So the front of the sword begins to glow.

03:24:56.935 --> 03:24:58.055
LAURA: Nice.

03:24:58.055 --> 03:24:58.925
ASHLEY: It's like a flashlight.

03:24:58.925 --> 03:24:59.805
LAURA: Yasha, that's clutch!

03:24:59.805 --> 03:25:00.955
MARISHA: That's really cool.

03:25:00.955 --> 03:25:03.545
LIAM: I should have thought of that. (whooshing)

03:25:03.545 --> 03:25:05.103
Fire in my hand.

03:25:06.495 --> 03:25:08.345
MARISHA: Look at you. You're a trendsetter.

03:25:08.345 --> 03:25:10.070
ASHLEY: I-- Thanks.
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:25:10.070 --> 03:25:12.646
MATT: With the additional light
and with the sword out there as well,

03:25:12.646 --> 03:25:15.880
you can see that both sides of this hall end about

03:25:15.880 --> 03:25:18.415
35, 40 or so feet beyond on each side,

03:25:18.415 --> 03:25:20.485
and you can make out, with what light you have,

03:25:20.485 --> 03:25:24.085
that there are detailed glyphs carved

03:25:24.085 --> 03:25:26.855
into the top and bottom of each of these sides,

03:25:26.855 --> 03:25:29.572
which you envision would be the anchor points for this wall

03:25:29.572 --> 03:25:31.125
that was previously there.
TALIESIN: Okay.

03:25:31.125 --> 03:25:33.995
LAURA: Let's keep going. Let's take out this crest.

03:25:33.995 --> 03:25:35.156
TRAVIS: We'll go to the stairs.

03:25:35.156 --> 03:25:37.025
LAURA and MATT: All right.

03:25:37.025 --> 03:25:40.105
MATT: Stepping down the staircase, the familiar blue light

03:25:40.105 --> 03:25:43.135
begins to fill the chamber before you,

03:25:43.135 --> 03:25:45.985
as you come to a nearly identical room as to the one

03:25:45.985 --> 03:25:50.081
that you previously found in the ruins of A5.

03:25:50.081 --> 03:25:51.025
MARISHA: Oh.

03:25:51.025 --> 03:25:52.995
MATT: The same stairs that descend into

03:25:52.995 --> 03:25:55.215
a somewhat round chamber,

03:25:55.215 --> 03:25:57.895
the somewhat curved balcony to the right and left

03:25:57.895 --> 03:26:00.325
with some faint railing where it descends curve--

03:26:00.325 --> 03:26:03.105
where stairs curve around it into the center of the chamber

03:26:03.105 --> 03:26:05.235
or there's the central stairs that go to the middle.

03:26:05.235 --> 03:26:09.336
You see the large, carved, faintly glowing glyphs

03:26:09.336 --> 03:26:10.945
that reach across from the center of the floor,

03:26:10.945 --> 03:26:12.990
to the far wall and up the wall,

03:26:12.990 --> 03:26:16.785
and there, atop and in the center, you see embedded,

03:26:16.785 --> 03:26:21.105
the large, glowing, blue threshold crest.

03:26:21.105 --> 03:26:22.732
SAM: We got it.

03:26:22.732 --> 03:26:24.028
MATT: And that's where we'll pick up next time.

03:26:24.028 --> 03:26:25.819
(groaning)

03:26:25.819 --> 03:26:27.158
TRAVIS: Not yet, we're don't.

03:26:27.158 --> 03:26:27.991
MATT: (chuckles)

03:26:27.991 --> 03:26:29.935
We'll pick up from there next time

03:26:29.935 --> 03:26:31.845
as you guys have located your second threshold vault.

03:26:31.845 --> 03:26:33.935
SAM: Are we going to break it or take it?

03:26:33.935 --> 03:26:37.035
TALIESIN: We can't break that thing.
LAURA: I feel like we should try to break it.

03:26:37.035 --> 03:26:37.868
TALIESIN: It's magical.

03:26:37.868 --> 03:26:40.725
LAURA: If we take it they can take it from us.

03:26:40.725 --> 03:26:42.987
We should destroy it.
SAM: No, we should take it

03:26:42.987 --> 03:26:44.625
because then it's a bargaining chip.

03:26:44.625 --> 03:26:46.779
LAURA: No! They're going to kill us and take it.

03:26:46.779 --> 03:26:49.729
SAM: Then it means we might get to see the city come.

03:26:50.875 --> 03:26:52.320
MARISHA: Shit, I have so much more I want to do.

03:26:52.320 --> 03:26:53.367
TALIESIN: Break the armor first--

03:26:53.367 --> 03:26:54.605
TRAVIS: We'll decide, we'll decide.

03:26:54.605 --> 03:26:56.155
MATT: You got time, you got time to figure out

03:26:56.155 --> 03:26:59.554
what you're going to do while we await our next episode.

03:26:59.554 --> 03:27:00.637
MARISHA: Fuck! Okay.

03:27:02.845 --> 03:27:03.886
MATT: All righty. Well.

03:27:03.886 --> 03:27:05.905
Thank you all for joining us tonight.

03:27:05.905 --> 03:27:07.645
We will see you next week.

03:27:07.645 --> 03:27:09.357
Don't forget we love you very much.

03:27:09.357 --> 03:27:11.382
And is it Thursday yet?

03:27:11.382 --> 03:27:12.215
Good night.
